<h3>孔祥熙暢論　財政穩定</h3>
<p>（重慶）孔祥熙博士爲美聯社撰述一文、略謂、在中日戰爭爆發之初、有人以爲中國之財政、將早歸崩潰、及至今日、其此項希望、已完全歸於幻滅、中國經兩足年之苦戰、不獨經濟機構、並未動搖、且事實上已指明中國更能爲長期之支持、當然中國在財政上所遭遇之問題、不僅甚多、抑且極爲困難、但中國財政上所以能作長期之戰爭、殊出意料者、理由甚多、（一）在此次戰爭之前數年、中國曾以種種綿密之計劃與努力、增强其財政與經濟機構、使其得以實施應付戰時財政困難之種種措施、（二）人民政治統一的進步、民族主義之澎湃、對於政府政策之支持、又使政府管理國家戰時經濟之力量增强不少、（三）中國國民經濟生活、比較的爲農業的、故在許多方面、易於自給自足、（四）中國廣大無限之內地、不僅富於人力、抑且富於資源、加以人民克苦勤勞、遂使政府努力建設之計劃、得以遂行、（五）各國對於中國抗戰之同情漸知威脅中國之自由與獨立、同時實更危害各國之經濟利益與政治安全、余深信此點對於中國之財政穩定、此後必仍有極大之帮助、（六）中國戰時經濟管理上之所以獲有成效者、在匯兌之維持、中國與各國同、皆有其戰時之貨幣困難、故不能不爲經濟上貿易上之調整、幸中國在一九三五年十一月巾之幣制改革、獲有强固之基礎、故對於法幣匯率之維持、相當的著有成效、於此我人所應感謝者、郎爲美英兩國對於中國之援助、如美國之購買中國白銀、其進出口銀行之對華二千五百萬放款、又如英國之對華信用放款、同時又曾與中國銀行合作成立之一千萬鎊平準基金、皆爲使中國貨幣政策得以順利進行之原因、但外人在遠東有商業利益者亦受惠不淺焉、中國戰時財政之另一特點、且與外人利益有極大之關係者、卽爲中國政府對於債信之竭力維持是也、按近年以來、世界財政界中之賴付債款延付債款、甚至完全否認國債者、多至不一而足、但國民政府甚至將以往北平政府所不能償付之債、亦一併擔負矣、在戰爭爆發後之一年內、中國始終償付各債之本息、不以軍費之浩大、與其他戰時費用之繁雜、而稍减其支持債信之決心、此爲中國信用在內外市塲上不動搖之原因、此在中國政府與人民、當然爲極困難之事、但中國並未宣佈延付各債之本息、在戰爭爆發後之二十一個月中、中國所支付之內外各債之本息、數達五三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇之鉅、但內外各債、多以關鹽二稅爲擔保、而關鹽二稅、早被攫奪、故中國在此方面維持信用之決心、實屬大足稱道者、又自一九三七年七月至一九三八年底之期間巾、中國政府以他方面之收入支付關稅擔保之債款者、達一七五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、但按理此項債券之本息固應由淪陷區巾之關稅收入支付者、中國政府又因產鹽區域尤其河北與山東鹽稅收入之被佔、迫不獲已、遂於去年九月間暫將以常時到期之克利斯潑及英法債券停止支付、直至本年正月十二日始行另謀辦法、自此時起、財部對於海關監督不再繼續撥款、同時命其將不受干涉處之稅款、存入中央銀行、以供支付長期債券之用、至本年三月廿六、政府對於鹽稅、亦曾爲同樣之措置、所可滿意者、卽此種爲環境所逼成之暫時措置、頗蒙金融市塲之同情與諒解、再則中國政府雖因進行戰事、困難萬分、但仍將繼續付債也、按本年三月廿六日、中國政府曾表示與各國商議如何保持中國債券握有人之利益、深信此項談判、必能獲有滿意之結果也、除前方之種種不快意的變化外、中國之外國友人更應注意中國後方之大規模的經濟發展、中國現正以極大之努力、謀貿易工業鑛業農業交通之發展、以期在中國之廣大後方西北西南、造成一新的經濟帝國、此種發展、現正在不顧一切困難的猛進中、不僅對於中國有莫大之利益、同時對於各友邦亦有極大之利益、但爲實施此項偉大之經濟發展計、中國政府極望各國能予以經濟上的技術上的援助、至於中國之建設、當以中國國父孫中山先生之實業計劃爲準繩、中國歡迎外國之合作、不僅在求戰時財政之穩定、同時更盼外國能於戰時援助中國作經濟上之開發是也、（六日美聯社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>今日的前瞻與後顧</h3>
<p>「假定時令還沒有交到夏季，今天何至如此酷熱！」「假定中日兩國在兩年之前，由國際外交的正常途徑，圖謀解決糾紛，即使交涉了兩年，依然不能圓滿解決，但能始終避免用兵，則今年今日，何至到此地步」！這都是最愚笨的感慨。因為時間逐日過去了，永不回頭；空間被事實佔住了，擺在眼前；所「假定」的，無法抓住了使他實現，儘感慨有何益處？</p>
<p>日本人的長處是專心致志，深謀遠慮；這是無論對日本人是愛是憎是友是敵，一體是認的。日本對中國的行動，即是專心致志與深謀遠慮的結晶。但是在他們的歷史上，從沒有打過這樣久的伏，化過這樣多的錢；他們當初但願速戰速決，誰多不料經過了兩年，依然渺茫，祇造成了今年今日的局面。當然，在日本人方面，決不承認失敗，况有軍事佔領的許多點與綫，可以做反證；但是點不是決勝點，綫不是決勝綫，佔領亦不是征服；從任何方面觀察，以第三者的地從頭再來，作客觀的論斷，終不能認日本為已經成功；若以速戰速決為衡量的標準，更不能　言於相當失敗。這所謂「智者千慮，必有一失」，日本人失在時間。在中國方面，原來是被動的應戰，以長期抵抗為號召；無疑地，要旨在乎控制時間，作為空間的陣地。</p>
<p>感慨是愚笨的，一切感情用事的言論行動，無一不是愚笨的！摒除了感情，檢討現實：今年今日的一切，除了依舊在兩年來的途徑中　續進展之外，我們不能發見何種新端倪。在中國方面，絕對沒有放棄抗戰的徵象；無論日本人論為中國不能抗戰，不宜抗戰，或懷疑於中國何為而抗戰，但北從山西，經河南湖北湖南江西，南至廣東，正規軍至今忠勇抗戰的事實俱在；此外，游擊戰的深入日軍後方，亦為日本人所從不否認。在日本方面，絕對沒有放棄侵略的徵象；無論日本實力消耗到怎樣程序，艱窘到捉襟露肘，乃至論斷侵略的祇宜速戰速決而不能持久；或解釋為日本行動並非侵略，日本意念亦不在侵略；但日本軍隊旣在中國境內，至少證明了事實上還滯留於侵略方式之中，而日本對國內的宣傳是獎進戰爭，對國際的宣傳是勸誘贊助日本的行動，總之，絲毫沒有罷兵息戰的氣息。</p>
<p>根據了中日兩國交戰中的現實，可以說明交戰經過兩年而到今年今日，祇是計算時間的分程，而不是劃時代的界綫。劃時代的界綫不知在何年何日，不知其或遠或近，未到界綫必先有徵象，今年今日，無比徵象。預言徵象，大可先設形形色色的千百種假定；除了愚笨的假定，沒有可能性的假定，我們假定三種：第一種，因為這一次戰爭是日本方面主動的設計的，故在日本國內倘若發見了和平氣息，不問氣息的來因，在政策的轉變，或力量的枯竭，這是中日戰爭劃時代的徵象。第二種，因為這一次戰爭，中國雖是初動，却是主角；中國雖耐性着長期抗戰，但必有一次總反攻，這又是中日戰爭劃時代的。第三種在國際。國際假定有比中日戰爭規模更大的戰爭，當然影響到中日戰局：假定國際能維持和平，則兩年以來，雖國際對中日有了不少表示，且表示希望中日息爭，但到現在為止，他們絕對沒有使中日息急的行動，將來有此一日，國際有些行動，這亦是中日戰爭劃時代的徵象。三種徵象，不同因，不同果；冷眼觀察，信有其可能。</p>

<p>徐州通信、徐州日軍、前曾七路進犯蘇皖邊境銅蕭靈宿各縣游擊隊、當被各游擊隊分別痛擊、斃日軍達三百餘名、華軍亦傷亡頗重、乃轉移至適當地點、整頓實力、再圖反攻、日軍則於撤退徐州時、竟將雲瞿衝團蔡園桂由各數十村莊焚燒、以資報復、因是蘇皖邊境人民、抗戰情緒、異常濃厚、除將各地偽組織1律消滅外、所有徐南日軍據點之少數日兵、分別解決、日前並將津浦路曹村三堡間之鐵路橋樑、予以破壊、日軍車因而顚覆一列、刻日軍對津浦路各站、續增駐軍、以資保護、並悉徐東徐北各部游擊部隊、與某路軍格外活躍、至徐西一帶之蕭沛各縣、更已展開游擊戰爭、使日軍防不勝防、疲於奔命、現各縣武力、均已取得密切聯繫以發揮游擊工作、</p>
<h3>廣州日軍强抽壯丁　訓練偽警為防範華軍工具　繁盛地點被劃為日商業區　港西報載日軍忽退出廣州</h3>
<p>香港通信、日軍盤踞廣州以來、時遭華軍便衣游擊隊·及別動隊襲擊、而市內偽警、旣不充實、力量空虛、因而一屆黑夜、多不敢站崗警戒、H軍司令安籐、乃決定增强所謂「治安」實力、除飭令日憲兵團日夜加派憲兵梭巡市內各街道監視偽警外、並限令偽市府增募僞警一千名、嚴密站崗守望、僞市府奉令後、已決定抽調市內商戶壯丁、實行訓練、派充偽警、並將廣州劃爲五大區、分區按戶抽調、如無壯丁交出、每戶須繳「治安費」五元、否則拘捕嚴辦、已於六月十五日、由僞市府發出佈吿、限令各商戶於月底一律遵照辦理、故市內壯丁、已紛紛逃避、</p>
<p>廣州日軍、爲企圖易於搜括起見、除迫令市內各大小商店一律恢復營業外、並獎勵日本商民設店營業、舉行所謂「商業貸款」、又將市內最稱繁盛之惠愛中路·漢民路·西濠n·長堤·等處、劃爲「日人商業區」如日商在各該指定區內營業、每家派有日兵一名駐守、以防華軍別動隊襲擊、但日商因鑒於商品無法推銷、且別動隊及游擊隊、又時常出沒市面、防不勝防、多不敢營業、日軍因此、乃又舉行其所謂「治安運動」、於六月十八·十九·兩日、除由日軍司令安籐親自召集全市日商、宣佈其決心限期肅淸市內「不良份子」保證今後日人商業順利外、卽令偽市府會同日憲兵團、定於二十日起、實施緊急戒嚴、企圖减少別動隊及游擊隊之突襲、、但事實上、殊難奏效、祇徒增加市內刁斗森嚴之氣象耳、</p>
<p>據本港士蔑西報二十八日載稱、該報忽接駐沙面專員報吿、謂盤據廣州之日軍、由二十七日開始、突然撤退、該消息雖未經官方之證實、但頗爲可靠、根據該專員之報吿、謂駐廣州之日軍、突爾完全失蹤、卽市區各重要據點、亦不見有日軍把守、長堤一帶、為交通要衝地點、頗為重要、向有日海陸軍把守、戒備森嚴、但由二十七日起、日軍蹤跡渺然、卽往昔佈置之防禦工事、亦盡行撤銷、在白鵝潭河面、向有日砲艦多艘停泊、亦同時失蹤、去向不明、査日海陸軍此次突爾撤退、用意莫明、因最近廣州情形、無若何急激變化也、據一般觀察、廣州日軍退出消息、如獲得證實、則料爲目前國際形勢對日方極形不利所致云</p>

<h3>維護航行　英國態度堅決　對日方阻撓決置之不顧　日商各公司圖壟斷一切</h3>
<p>日本企圖獨霜中國航業、阻撓第三各國船隻之行駛、於是各國均受影響、日本反佔中國航行之首位、英國力爭維護對華航行、日商各公司竭力擴充航綫、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>各國航業　蒙受影響</p>
<p>日阻撓第三各國在華航行、（一）任何檢查扣留各國船隻、（二）封鎖非淪陷區及游擊隊控制之各口岸、（三）藉口有軍事行動、阻止外輪行駛、（四）迫令江海關拒絕內港之結關、因此各國航業蒙受極大影響、例如五月份商船往來外洋旗別統計、日本第一爲七百六十八隻、一百零六萬零五百八十二噸、英國第二、爲三百四十隻、九十九萬三千九百十一噸、德國第三、爲二十九隻、十六萬零四百五十八噸、</p>
<p>蘇北航行　爲日控制</p>
<p>江蘇之海門及阜寗、自日方阻止外輪行駛後、今因阜髯之合興鎭、及海門之靑龍港、現巳爲日軍所佔領、故已允外輪復航、（一）靑龍港（即北沙錢）行駛船隻爲義和·江定·海宜·派德·德耀·萬通·利沙·亭熙·等輪、（二）合興鎭（即阜寗綫）已准希商利物多輪行駛、該輪定十二日結關、十三日由滬直放合興鎭、惟行駛靑龍港及合興鎮之船隻、須受日軍之命令、控制一切、</p>
<p>英商力爭　維護航綫</p>
<p>英商太古·怡和·等公司、對日方之阻撓航行、除力爭維護在華原有航錢外、今仍派輪照常行駛、並決定必要時請英艦隨輪保護、如行駛滬港航綫之各輪、照常兼灣汕頭、對二福建之泉州·福州·興化·沙埕·三都澳·等各口岸、不允放棄、繼被派輪行駛、行駛北沙綫之英商怡和之義和輪、今已實行山英艦隨輪保護開航、此外並新闢中國與海外航綫、除滬防綫外、將闢滬暹航綫、</p>
<p>日商擴充　沿海航行</p>
<p>日商各輪船公司竭力擴充在華航業、除收買或承租舊輪外、並計劃建造新輪、噸位自三千噸至五千噸、專行駛中國沿海各口岸、今華北靑島·烟台·龍口·威海衛·天津、以及東三省各地航綫、巳爲日商日淸大連等公司所獨霸、最近企圖再壟斷華南各航綫、除滬厦綫已開航外、並將開航滬港綫、所以此後第三各國對華之航業、勢爲日所完全刦奪、</p>
<h3>包裹郵票　當塲購貼　在各組窗口購買　不符者得予停寄</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局局長乍配林氏、對於各項包裹寄遞辦法、皆設法以繁就簡、近再通吿各郵包寄件人云、查近有包裹寄件人、在本局各包裹組交寄包裹、其郵費往往向別處購買貼用、致使包裹上實貼數目、與各包裹組出售郵票數目核計相差甚多、爲便於核對起見、凡在本局各包裹組交寄包裹、其應貼之郵票、應向各該組之售票窗口購買一節、業經本局於二十七年十二月七日通吿在案、茲查仍有上述情事發生、故再行通吿、如包裹寄件人業巳購買大批郵票、而尙未用去者、須於本月五日至六日（上午九時至下午四時止）持同該項郵票向包裹業務股登記、自此次登記之後、凡郵包寄件人交寄包裹、所需郵票、除業已登記者、准予使用外、務須在各相關包裹組購買、其購買郵票在五十元及以上者、務須塡具「請購郵票單」、是項「購買郵票單」第二聯、經售票員蓋章撕下後、須由寄包人繳有不符情事者、本局得予停止收寄、</p>
<h3>外商輪公司　籌劃滬甬復航　謀福輪昨返滬明日仍開鎭海　各公司正估計復航費用問題</h3>
<p>德商禮和洋行謀福輪、業於昨日下午、由甬到滬、該輪定明晨仍續駛鎭海、停泊口外、中意太古等褕公司、亦計劃派輪復航、各情如次、</p>
<p>謀福報吿　封鎖情形</p>
<p>自日軍在定海登陸、浙海形勢突趨緊張後、寗波之鎮海口、即經當局下令封鎖、禁阻外輪出入甬江、以固防務、據意商中意輪公司接得電吿、停泊鎭海招商碼頭留備沉作堵塞缺口之老太平輸、即經於上月二十八日晚九時鑿沉、但德商禮和洋行方面、則迄未接得上項電吿、故認爲交通雖吿封鎖、但太平輪則不致鑿沉、因之消息紛岐、旅滬浙人、尤多關切、蓋希異太平輪不予下沉也、聞太平輪確移靠封鎖綫旁、隨時可以拔塞下沉、缺口並未完全堵塞、故駁船仍可在空隙處出入、</p>
<p>客貨均在　口外駁卸</p>
<p>德商禮和洋行謀福輪、前經甬防守司令部特准、於甬江封鎖後、續行駛甬一次、但因缺口業已禁航、致不獲進口、所有客貨、均在口外駁卸、轉運至甬、茲已卸裝完竣、於昨晨四時啟椗返滬、業於當日下午二時半抵埠、船泊羅斯福碼頭、謀福輪爲維持滬甬交通、決定繼續航行、抵甬時停泊口外、客貨則山拖駁轉運、茲已定明日淸晨（八日）仍直放鎭海、</p>
<p>中意太古　亦籌復航</p>
<p>至意商中意公司、英商太古洋行、亦計劃派德平新北京等輪、恢復滬甬航錢、現正估計貨物運駁費用、與水脚收入之是否能維持開支、俟籌劃就緒、即可開航、觀於德商謀福輪之決定明晨續航寗波、足證外輪確有恢復航行之決意、以維持其在華之航業權益、但是否能獲順利航行、則爲另一問題、</p>
<p>髯波情形　安謐如恒</p>
<p>甯波自迭遭日機轟炸後、全市居民均已自動疏散、遷避入鄕、商市則改晚間、甬地阻航後、情形益見蕭條、惟連日秩序頗爲安謐、常有空襲警報發生、但日機在最近十日來、並未前往投彈、至於本年六月底、原爲商界結賬期、但因情形特殊、市面蕭條、故經甬商會決定、六底結賬、暫吿延期、</p>
<h3>工部局警務處　重行登記刊物　各報館雜誌及通訉社等　限本月內赴局重行登記</h3>
<p>公共租界警務處業已決定將已登記之報紙雜誌及通訊社等重行登記、本埠各報館雜誌及通訊社、應於本月內將其登記　送交警務處政治部、以便重行登記、逾期常作無效、</p>

<h3>客帮惟利是圖　滬米運銷外埠　租界當局決予杜絕　存米略减洋米起運</h3>
<p>滬市米糧售價、前因一般投機奸商圖飽私囊、自動提高米價、致滬市民食問題、一度趨於恐慌狀態、後經H部局出而干涉、訂定最高白粳、不得超過二十一元限價、現一般無識米商、作客帮買賣、大量運往外埠、俾獲巨利、當局對於此項事端、頗加注意、全滬米棧存米調查、第十四期業於昨日發表、計共三十九萬九千九百零二包、比上週减少三萬六千五百二十五包、此爲靑黃不接時之應有現象、茲分誌於下、</p>
<p>客幫圖利　外運脫售</p>
<p>豆米市塲自經訂定最高白米不得超過二十一元、及中次各貨亦經規定標準價格、並由工部局按日於交易時間內遺派探目、馳赴市塲監督、致操縱者無法施技、市塲人心安定、現已恢復舊觀、聞各帮客商、近來頗爲活躍、大量購囤、運往外埠求售、圖獲厚利、此舉影響民食前途頗鉅、日後存底减少、米市發生變化、均應由米商負其全責、租界當局對於此種外流食米、將予以杜絕、以維界內民食、昨日各地來源、仍未見增、車輪包子裝來四千餘包、河下共到三四號、無錫等地仍未弛禁、上午市塲共成交三千六七百包、叉悉愛多亞路十五號雜糧油餅交易所、今日停市一天、</p>

<h3>浙閩戰雲漸緊　日艦砲轟玉環穿山再圖登陸　鎭海福州長門前日均有空襲　本埠航業界所得消息</h3>
<p>昨日下午由航業界接得消息、五日晨七時許、日軍二百餘名、在日艦猛烈砲火掩護之下、再度擬向玉環登陸、當地駐軍即起應戰、發生激烈戰事、現溫州口外、泊有日艦五艘、不時向岸上發砲轟擊、形勢仍緊、惟華方軍事當局、早有嚴密佈置、沉着應付、</p>
<p>鎭海又遭　兩度空襲</p>
<p>鎭海於前日（五日）上午八時、又有日機兩架侵入、當在城區投彈多枚、濫肆轟炸、旋於九時左右、復有日海軍飛機三架、再度前往肆虐、在南門外投彈六枚、該處規模最大之震興泰廣貨號被中一彈、磨屋全燬、死傷十餘人、現鎭海四外瀝港洋面、泊日艦三艘、但無異動、聞奉化亦被炸、</p>
<p>日艦三艘　砲轟穿山</p>
<p>五日晨八時許、穿山洋面日艦三艘陣地開砲轟擊、達一十餘發、華方損失甚微、日軍企圖似在探視華軍實力、前會數度企圖在該處登陸、均遭華軍堅强抵抗、未能得逞、蓋華方軍事當局、在該處早佈有重兵、防務極鞏固、現穿山仍有二日艦停泊未去、</p>
<p>日機十餘　轟炸閩境</p>
<p>閩江風雲、因日艦續增達二十七八艘、不時向沿海發砲騷擾、日機復在沿海一帶轟炸、情形頗緊、探悉、五日晨日機十餘架、分批在福州長門等處投彈轟炸、損失未詳、</p>
<p>日出雲艦　開往閩海</p>
<p>日本出雲旗口日領事館碼頭、巳有數月之久、前日午後二時、忽然起椗離滬、行駛出口、聞目的係駛往福建海面、指揮作戰、並悉另有驅逐艦一艘、亦於出雲起椗之前開出、</p>
<h3>日機　轟炸北橋</h3>
<p>滬西漕河涇鎭、前由日員西村策動、任命韓鈞、籌組武裝僞警部、迄已成立五個中隊、計有六七百名、一部份已有武裝、詎日前忽有北橋日指導員森山、商准西村、借用偽警一中隊、鎭攝北橋、經西村允派第四中隊隨往、迨抵鎮後、該僞警全部反正、事後日方痛失新式機槍兩挺、及步槍百餘桿、故除向森山嚴重交涉外、現經日方撥派飛機、在北橋四週上空、飛繞偵察、前日一度遭日機擲彈轟炸、民間受損情形、容探明續誌、</p>
<h3>缺乏排水河渠　租界馬路泛濫　西區無正當管理機關　數處路面因大水浮起</h3>

<h3>新申請法頒布後　外匯暗市漸鬆　進口商對必需品外匯停止購結　準備直接向中交兩行依法申請</h3>
<p>財政部禁止奢侈品及非必需品進口、並促進土貨輸出起見、特先後頒布貨物結滙領取差額及必需品申請外滙規則後、中央銀行已停止辦理申請事宜、而由中交兩行憑外滙審查會之核准通知書、供給進口商之法定外滙、而收取法價與銀行掛牌價之差額、惟上海中交等銀行、尙未接到部令及總行通知、故何時實行、猶未決定、據新新社記者探悉、連日來中央銀行法價懸牌、仍照常未有變動、滙豐銀行對於暗市需要、仍按照六便士左右匯價供給、但自各行莊限制提存後、現鈔缺乏、投機者無從收購、同時一部份進口商、以必需品之外滙、已可向中交兩行申請、現已停止在暗市購買、准備向中交兩行依法申請、因此外滙暗市滙價、漸趨鬆穩、</p>
<p>一週滙市　已趨穩定</p>
<p>六日法文上海日報載、聞在上週間、星期一及星期二兩日、外滙市塲、巳趨穩定、此殆人所預知之現象、則以實施匯劃制度之後、流動之資金、過形缺乏之故也、因此之故乃使若干之握有外匯者、被迫而出賣、以求得現金、藉充爲六月末結帳時淸算之資源、在此情勢之下、自不免有若干投機者、大受損失、惟此種之人造的穩定匯市、惜乎不能長久、故至星期三起、投機家以購外滙者、又復紛至、而外匯之近期與遠期間、亦發生有巨大差額、然在此時、幸而匯豐銀行即以六辦士十六分之九之代價、出售外匯、是以一般人心、乃叉爲之安定矣、迨至星期四日、則亦有以六辦士八分之三之代價、出售七月份之外匯者、及至星期五日、則匯市又有變動、七月期之外匯、買者須出有六便士十六分之五之代價、</p>
<h3>綸昌罷工者要求　罷工費五十萬　朱玉軫竟謂公司無誠意　英總領向日領提出交涉</h3>
<p>字林報云、關於綸昌漂染印花公司之工廠中若千時日前發生罷工事、公司方面已續接恫嚇、英總領事斐利溥因此事而於昨日（五日）午後訪日總領事三浦、提出書面與口頭交涉、聞公司方面係於星期二日接此恫嚇、先是公司方面通知沛東「南區政務廳長」朱玉軫者、謂罷工者要求「罷工費」</p>
<p>五十萬元</p>
<p>實屬非法而荒謬、朱某遂於星期二日午後書面通知綸昌經理、謂據罷工者之意見、公司方面缺乏誠意、不允工人要求、或將起破壊公司利益之結果云、關於此點、須予述明者、修正綸昌廠罷工之談判、進行巳非一日、據近象察之、各種久延未決之點、即可雙方滿意而解決、衆信約百分之九十七之工人</p>
<p>切願復工</p>
<p>英總領事之交涉中、喚起日總領事對於罷工者要求之特殊性質、加以注意、並謂此事巳逾普通勞工爭執之範圍、工人今受破壊份子之恐嚇與强迫無疑、叉謂日總領事會書面保證完全保護浦東周家嘴與白蓮涇綸昌兩廠、斐氏並要求謂觀於朱某言含恫嚇、日總領事應竭力完全履行此等諾言、而予廠中英人生命及產業以充量保護、</p>

<p>遣之他往</p>
<p>而復收容今居全市其他收容所中之難民、該收容所中之學校日前收有孩童一千三百餘人、因所中敎室不敷、故分成三部、所中並已設有手工塲數處、使大批難民能得職業、此等手工塲將在收容所當局之嚴密管理下繼續經營云、</p>

<h3>建立起「筆的堡壘」</h3>
<p>— 星火</p>
<p>抗戰發動以後的文壇，表現着一點空前的進步：就是應着客觀環境與時代的要求，跟着全民族統一戰綫的展開，在文藝工作者之問，已消除了過去的成見，克服了偏狹的流派觀念，感悟於文藝工作與政洽經濟社會……各部門工作的不可分性，要擔當起神聖的抗戰課與文藝領域中的戰士們的任務；兩年來，在抗戰的持續中，洋溢着的光明與希望，更冲淡了文藝工作者之間過去殘留着的個人主義色彩，在「一切服務於抗戰」的最高原則下，集中起我們的力量來；可是，正由於我們所處的時代是太偉大了，同時又太動盪了，才使我們不能不感到個人的力量的渺小，自己所能貢獻於祖國的實在太有限，面對着當前的現實，我們更有着加强集體力量的必要。</p>
<p>踏入準備反攻的新階段以後，抗戰課與我們的中心任務，無疑的該是組織的鞏固與戰鬥力的加强，這兩項任務之間有着極密切的聯繫：惟有發揮集體的力量，才能使今後的文藝工作得到更大的成就；當前的問題只有一個：就是怎樣將我們個人的力量溶融成一股集體的力量，再有機地與共他各部間的力量配合起來，勉成抗戰建國的艱鉅功業。</p>
<p>在現階段中，作爲文化鬥士的文藝工作者，也跟前方的戰士一樣，應以有機的動的戰術制勝；一方而我們固然應廣泛地利用「化整爲零」的方式來發揮我們的火力，但同時我們更不能忽略了隨時作「化零爲整」的準備。爲了集體力量的加强，我們文藝工作者應集中起手里的筆桿，建立起一個「筆的堡壘」來。這里，筆者願向文藝界的戰友們提出一個籲請，希望在最近期內，從號召到實踐，聯合起全國的文藝工作者建立起堅强的「筆陣」，作爲我們精神的堡壘！</p>
<p>當前的文壇上正顯示着組織與團結的曙光：一點是文藝通訊運動的發展，表現着一種富有鬥爭性的新形式是怎樣被廣大的羣衆以熱誠來接受來推進；另一是「文章義賣」的展開，普遍地表現着「孤島」上的文藝工作者對祖國的赤誠。由於這兩點，筆者感到「筆的堡壘」的建立決不會只是一個空泛的呼號，而一定能得到廣泛的響應，再進而見諸實踐。</p>
<p>今年一月中，應服羣先生在檢討去年一年中上海文藝界的總成績之後，曾指出：「沒有用文藝工作去團結，發掘文藝界的力量，是一年來文藝運動者大大的錯誤。」（見課報周刊第十二，三期一年來的上海文藝界）現在，新的年頭叉將過去一半，我們檢討過去，感到我們的努力還不够克服過去的錯誤；可是，我們決不氣餒，我們應寄希望於未來的半年，願文藝界以集體力量的表現來爲未來的半年增無限的輝煌！</p>
<h3>白日夢</h3>
<p>— 徐靑</p>
<p>「你懂得憤怒嗎？」</p>
<p>有一個朋友曾經對我說過這句話，從他的笑容中，我可以看出他的堅忍不　，他的粗糙的面孔，似像經過了一度風霜的磨鍊，而泛着紫色的辛紋，雖然他是很年靑。</p>
<p>不久，那朋友就悄悄地離開了，那是在三年前</p>
<p>現在，憤怒我是懂得了，而我還是啞息着，關在亭子間裏，讓鬱悶，煩惱來磨折我，度着沙漠裏一樣的生活。</p>
<p>當高溫度降臨到我的室裏時，我照例瞌了眼皮，幻想，做夢。</p>
<p>在朦朧于裏有一個聲音打着我的桌子：</p>
<p>「這豈是安樂土？整天地做白日夢！」</p>
<p>我給驚覺了，睜開了血絲佈滿的眼睛。這來客，鬍髭結得像羅漢，烏闊的眉崗下，兩顆很熟悉的眼睛閃着，</p>
<p>「現在，你該懂憤怒是什麽同事了！」他輕輕地笑一下，這一笑，立卽使我臉紅了起來，呀，他又回來了。</p>
<p>「的確，憤怒如一個火把，它會在狂風中燃得尤烈，常人家遏制你憤怒的時候，你會更加憤怒。像你這樣年靑，竟毫無一點火氣嗎？呵！你怎麼垂老了？」</p>
<p>「那你呢？你一定…」</p>
<p>「我！我懂得憤怒，我作了憤怒的嘗試！」他不等我的反問，就大聲嚷了。他捲起了衣袖，露出兩條胳臂，那上面全是焦黑的疤痕，有幾處才結着新疤，新的肉發着可怕的紅色。</p>
<p>「因爲我懂得債怒，所以我不能忍耐，我吼着吼着，我實地奮鬥。可是我被執了，在一個深夜裏，他們用爐火燒紅的鐵條烙我的胳臂，他們狠狠的撻我的身體。我咬着牙，一聲怨言或是一句哀求都沒有，因爲我懂得憤怒呀！他們說我是烤不死的魔鬼，而我終於倒下了！我犧牲了！」</p>
<p>我的心如火樣燒了，而我的皮膚上起了一陣寒抖：</p>
<p>「那你現在是個幽靈？」</p>
<p>「誰說不是呢！幽靈比肉體更可貴。肉體可磨滅，幽靈却是永生的，他來去自如，可以潛入每一個人的心裏！」</p>
<p>這來客說了一番之後，就向窗外去了。在室內，我淌着渾身的汗。我不禁啞然地失笑了：</p>
<p>「我做着白日夢呢！」</p>
<p>我醒了！我是否醒了？然而，這夢！這是否是個夢呢？</p>
<h3>願</h3>
<p>— 任林瑞</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>天快要暗了，我們登上末一次的擺渡，船上擠滿了人：趕市集的，賣菜的，做小買賣的和拉人力車的，許多苦力者。船搖擺着，　吱的搖櫓聲，夾雜着人們的喳嘈，落日淡淡地照耀在黃濁的江水中。</p>
<p>上碼頭。回頭看看對岸時，還有叢叢的點影在蠕動，被未一次的擺渡所遺留在那一邊的人羣，那只好出比較高的代價喚小擺渡。</p>
<p>跟着鄉人走上石子的小路。『諾！那不是車站？』老陸自語着。我順眼看去，那邊已上了燈，燈軍被風吹着，一搖一擺的，閃着亮光。</p>
<p>車站上已有好幾位同志等在那裏，我上前把老陸介紹給他們。寒暄了一會之後，這裹我們十幾個同志便登上一部車，把幾個行李包擱在車廂裏，好像卸下千斤重担。接着就輕鬆的，集中着談論戰局的發展。</p>
<p>火車開時，黑慕已遮上這塊土地，只有行進的機聲，來衝破這冷的黑夜，人在機聲的轉動中，隱約還能見到村火點紅。</p>
<p>車輪鐵軌撞出鳴吼，像在歡送我們的前進，叉像在唱自由的戰歌。</p>
<p>巧極，我們的車廂剛是機頭後的第一節，發現了這，馬上把玻璃窗打開，看着機工把煤向機爐里送，火舌無阻的向外張望，在黑夜裏見到火光，像已死去了的生命重又躍進人的鬥爭過程裹，大家繫托着臉部腠着，雖然煤烟還不時的往我們面前掠。</p>
<p>不上半個鐘點，我們的目的地到了，團部裏派來兩位武裝同志來接我們，其中有一個是近視眼老徐。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>到了林家祠堂團部的駐在辦事處，黑暗的房間裏，我摸着舊的鋪位，把稻草抖齊後，就把黑的軍用氈罩上去，零碎的東西也就雜堆在上面。</p>
<p>老陸對於這裏的東西一切是生疏的。我吿訴他，我們隨軍服務：白畫是下鄕宣傳，晚上協助駐軍放哨，另外還組織一個救護隊幫助紅十字會救護隊隨時出動，有時還派出幾位同志押解軍用器械……</p>
<p>……　……</p>
<p>經騐使我感覺到這是晚上七點鐘晚餐的集合號，就此打斷話頭，拉着老陸往外跑。</p>
<p>『各位同志：在未上餐室之前，我要報吿一件快樂的事情，』中隊長在四十多個同志的面前報吿着：『這是每一位同志每一天都要求着的，那就是此地駐在師部要我們派二十人到前綫去服務，擔負的任務是宣傳，軍服由師部供給，並且還另發津貼。這是一個很好的機會，不過要經過普通的考騐。願意的馬上可以簽名，晚餐後八點鐘全體在原處召集，最好每僩人是在十八歲以上。』他把最後的十八歲三個字提得特別響．</p>
<p>頓時起一陣熱烈的騷動，大家嚷着都耍去，結果是沒有一個不去，雖然有的是在年齡十八歲以下，我自己也是一個。</p>
<p>大家却好像沒心吃晚飯，二口併做一口吃，有的把粥湯痛了舌，但絕不埋怨，匆匆的吃了很快的都從餐室裏出來，三五個集在一堆，都在談論着怎樣才能達到自已的宿願。我也和老陸談着怎樣去應付這塲的入伍試騐，每人在澄黃油燈照耀下，憂愁地臉上顯出皺紋，都在着急着自己能否被選到前綫去。</p>
<p>秋風巳有點凉意，星光閃爍着。</p>
<p>八點鐘正，敲動每個人的心，我們的意志是一致的。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>我們記得昨天師部還不在這裏，便開始讚美着師部調動的迅速。</p>
<p>廳堂中有幾只桌子拚起來的公事檯，上面一盞燈用桑皮紙罩着。</p>
<p>一點都沒聲音，師部辦事處處長是個莊嚴的高個子，在微弱的燈光下，很仔細的點着我們的名字，漸漸的一個一個過去被試；有的同志都立着，他敎着坐下，還說不必慌，尤其是被試的時候。</p>
<p>問的是姓名年齡籍貫和你在國英算史地四科揀一科最比較好的來問。</p>
<p>每人的臉上都帶着微笑，很鎭靜的接答着所有的問題，有的同志竟說出題外的意志，說着家裹還有幾個哥姊，所以就是犧牲也不要緊，他們都是熱烈的，每人熱烈的冀望都能到達前綫，誰也不願意落後。</p>
<p>最後是問到我：</p>
<p>『幾歲？』</p>
<p>『十六歲。』</p>
<p>『最擅長的是那一科？』</p>
<p>『史地。』</p>
<p>『南滿鐵路在什麽地方，那里是起點止點……』</p>
<p>時候已經十點鐘，八位値班的武裝同志，帶着輕躍的心，笨重的步子先出去放哨。</p>
<h3>要把乾坤旋轉來</h3>
<p>— 倪季祥作</p>
<h3>亂草一束</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>希望</p>
<p>假如人生可以比方走路，那末，我說道路前面總亮着一星火花，也不妨說是燈塔，若即若離，你却始終不能追及。</p>
<p>行動並非盲目而是意識的——除掉痴人的。放槍時總得瞄準靶子，進軍也得先有目標。希望的光亮正是誘引人前進的魔杖。我們生活，我們追求</p>
<p>天眞的童心上飄浮着過多的幻想；孩子的時候我們就學會了織夢。但那却永遠是一團漆黑，如同小嘴上吹的胰子泡，一瞬間，破了，碎了。希望不是幻想，不是夢；是指引，是招呼，是光。</p>
<p>理智</p>
<p>誰曾有過這樣的經騐呢？臉紅紅地，懊着激動的心，用顫抖的手摸摸東，觸觸西，結果却莫知所措，終於撲倒在牀上上，埋着一張灰白的臉。</p>
<p>情感的激流冲落了心頭的安寗，在白天，在黑夜，尤其是靜靜的日午與有好月光的夜晚。我是說當你孤獨的時候。</p>
<p>快築起你理智的堤壩吧，好防止情感川流的泛濫。如果說生活是一種艱苦的學習，那就難在築不起理智的隄壩。</p>
<h3>紅鬼子瓦西卡</h3>
<p>— 高爾基著　狄周譯</p>
<p>『錢在什麽地方？……』</p>
<p>她因恐懼而發瘋了。</p>
<p>這是冬天的事，第二天早上把赤足，單襯杉的維娜從浴室帶出來，帶她在深雪之中走回家去。她靜靜的徵笑着，用快樂的聲音說：</p>
<p>『明天跟媽媽到敎堂去……再到敎堂去——去祈禱……』莎拉一看見維娜這狼狽情形，便在大家前面小聲的，戰戰兢兢的說道：</p>
<p>『可是錢並不是我偷的，……』</p>
<p>在和瓦西卡的關係裏，要講些其他什麽是困難的。除在他面前發抖和對他的憎惡。</p>
<p>她們全都勾引他，包圍他，一心想做他的情婦。同時她們都希望自己的「可信任的」心腹相好，客人，流氓把瓦西卡弄死。可是，他有可怕的氣力，又從不喝得酩酊大醉；做了他是不容易的。不知多少次數，把砒霜撒在他的食物和飲料裹；而且有時雖很順利的中了計，可是他又完全治好了，很詫異的他全曉得了別人對他的陰謀。可是他在無數的敵人之中，關於多少觸動他即對妓女冷酷的殘忍之心的冒點險手段，不大放在心上。他老是冷冷的說：</p>
<p>『一有機會，你們也許會用牙齒把我咬碎，這我曉得！……不過現在別那麽自找苦頭！……我是什麼都不怕的！……」說着便突出厚嘴唇，望着各人的臉孔，哼着鼻子發笑——大槪這是在嘲笑她們罷。</p>
<p>他和本區的警官們常來妓院的便衣法警們展開了共同戰綫。但他們中沒一個朋友，也不想我個知己，較之其他的人更多來往，他對一體的人全都同樣淡漢的交際着。</p>
<p>他和他們喝啤酒，談談每晚本區發生的犯罪案子。假使沒有人請他打妓女，或照那地方的說法，要他去「嚇唬一下」，那就呆在家裏，什麽地方都不去。</p>
<p>他當差的那房子，是屬於右手房子的一部分，向客人收人堂費——白天三盧布，晚上五盧布。</p>
<p>鴇母菲沽拉愛露馬萊瓦娜，是個胖大個子，快五十歲了的女人。愚蠢而又壊心腸；她很怕瓦西卡，又把他當做實貝，每月除了食宿，——臥房是一個墳墓般的狹小的閣樓。——還給他十五盧布。她家裏沾瓦西卡的光，姑娘們保守着模範的秩序，她們十一個人，全都羔羊似的　和。</p>
<p>菲沽拉·愛露馬萊瓦娜，以一種自慶幸福的心情跟知客們說話，還常常像母猪和母牛樣的自誇自己店裏的姑娘們。（三）</p>

<p>（一）早晨醒來的時候，第一件事情，就是要想到上帝一夜的保佑，或是想做一些事情來服事上帝。晚間就睡時，也應當感謝上帝一天的恩惠，求上帝使你今夜好睡，同時不致貪睡宴起（二）各人對於他的職務應當勤勉從事，不可無故廢時失業。（三）遇有空餘時，應當默想，行些利人的善事。「交友」也是一件不可　忽的事。（四）假日或禮拜六下午，與禮拜日，不可認爲閒游之日，應有計劃，作一些於身心有益及利他的事。（五）勿與滬徒賭徒及無事做的人交友。（六）勿爲消遣之故，而與人閒談。（七）年齡大的人勿做年齡幼稚者的事，（八）我們所做的事，非但要與年齡相稱，也要與我們的身份和地位相稱。有些人，身居要職，而做卑微，不足道之事，如尼羅王終日往來於希臘街上，與彈琴者競爭高下。（九）我們所做的事情，應當拿基督教道德標準。（十）無論何人，對於服飾飲食，不應過於講究，以免費時失業。（十一）我們應當去除無謂的好奇心。（十二）無謂的酬酢應當極力辭却。（十三）娛樂要選正當而有益身心的。（十四）爲上帝行事，不可懶惰，（摩耳爵士，一次與一般敎徒同做　吿，忽然國王有命召他前去，當時他回答說，他要先侍奉過了萬王之王（即耶穌），然後來侍奉國王。）—上海基督教文字佈道會，郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>腎虧腦弱夏令進補的必要</h3>
<p>梔子花開心裹焦，問愛何為怒火燒？</p>
<p>昨天有人打電話來說：『患腎虧症，兼有腦弱，近來因為天熱，症象加劇，但夏令進袖恐不甚相宜，不知有否其他更好的辦法？』夏令不宜進補，這種錯誤的觀念，恐怕普遍在一般人的腦中吧！誠然，夏令因天氣熱，人們的消化力較弱，大魚大肉和豐富脂肪性的滋養料，確實是比較難以吸收且有碍胃腸。但除此以外消化比較容易的補品，何嘗不相宜呢？何况夏令症象惡化的時候，飢者食，渴者飲，進補也是一樣。</p>
<p>腎虧症的出來，說者雖多，但大都為早年犯有自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，把生殖腺液（精液）消耗太多，則不特外部生殖器官受其摧殘，同時生殖腺內分泌素布告枯竭。則新陳代謝减退，發育機能停滯，腦，脊髓，性各部神經呈現衰弱，因此，凡滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精力渙散等症即相繼而來。然在此肉感的夏季，當香湯浴罷花前月下與愛侶相對，情不自禁這恐亦難免的事，並且一月之內恩愛夫婦作一二次的性行為，也不能說是過度。但若丈夫有上述症象則雖逢喜，亦無法美滿，這怎能不引起妻子的憎恨而怒火中燒呢？同時腎虧症常與腦弱相併發。則在此夏季，終日頭昏目眩，記憶不良，思想遲鈍，志氣消沉，失眠多夢，形容枯槁，腰酸背痛，肢體憊疲等種種症象，更不一而足。此種男子不特做了愛情中的罪人，亦且成為社會上的　　，人家將鵬程萬里，而他呢日處愁城苦海中！</p>
<p>腎虧腦弱患者，果然萬分的討厭而危險，但在今日醫學昌明的時代，治療亦非難事。據世界名醫的千萬病案，及余十餘年來之實地經騐，均以為採用生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最為對症特效，因此劑係山雄壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，海狗，熊鹿等體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成，所以品質貴重，效力偉大，為其他類似製劑所萬萬不及。患者於服用此劑後，一小時藥力即開始，二十四小時內即能生精袖腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，繼續服用半月并可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，長服更可收延年益壽返老還童之功。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（五洲中西中法等大藥房有售）以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效更為神速！</p>
<h3>遺精在夏季的特效療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>遺精的原因和病理以及失治後危險的一般，在本刋前兩期我們已再三的說了。但為什麼遺精症在夏天每加劇？有無特效的療法？因為大多數患者迫切的要求，故再來一說：夏天因為氣候火熱體內所產生的勢力，需要减少，而體內的勢力又不得不產生，於是需要發洩，隨有汗液的排出，各組織呈鬆弛狀態，司精囊開闔的精關亦然，同時因男女們的袒胸露腿，肉感的刺激較多，因此種種原因，凡患有遺精者，易使症象惡化，遺洩的次數增多。此外因夜晚天熱失眠，影響於神經衰弱，卽無遺精而發現遺洩者有之，已患遺精而招致滑精漏精者亦是常有的！滑精為夜間無夢，而有精液不自知覺地遺出者之謂，漏精則雖在白日因見女色或用腦用力過度，或在大小便時亦有少些精液滲出者之謂。這是遺精中最可怕的症象。若延遷不治，勢必至精枯血枯，腦衰腎虧，則雖有嬌妻而不能度幸福生活，雖有事業良機，而不能勝任愉快，茫茫此生，直如墮入地獄中，甚至早衰早殤，前途不堪設想！</p>
<p>夏季的遺精療法，必須從鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，使夜得安眠，减少夢幻着手。則服「希米脫氏固精片」即完全具此功能。所以中外名醫均認此劑治療遺精最為對症特效。治愈的病例，已不下數千萬人了。惟腦弱腎虧者須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，則標本兼治，收效尤速。患者能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，更可保證治愈</p>

<p>除了戴銅邊眼鏡的陳腐老頭兒之外，百分之百的男子，對於女子的審美觀念，我想必都着重於乳峯高聳，臀部　腴的健美女性吧？因為乳峯高聳，臀部　腴的健美女性，不但在姿態上，因曲線的明顯，肉感的　富，引得男子們心旌搖搖，愛慕備至。即於身心與體魄上，由於生殖腺卵巢分泌的充盈，新陳代謝作用的旺盛，所以性情無不溫柔體貼，理解無不清晰周詳，肌肉更無不白晳而滋潤，面頰如三春之花，對人常現出盈盈笑　，此種女郎，真似社會的瑰寶，人間的仙子，在處女時，必為人人愛慕，人人追求，而一旦出嫁以後，因體態性情之過人。故夫婦間的愛情，自然非常濃厚，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女。其幸福真是不可限量。但過去如因束胸自凟，月經不調，白帶不感，產後虧弱，重症侵害，以致卵巢機能遭遇摧殘，影响新陳代謝作用者。則不特失去動人的美姿，抑且每為男子所厭惡，幸福毫無！唯一補救辦法，祇有立即服以生殖腺卵巢分泌製劑女用「生殖素」，則一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，消滅子宮病患，促進妊娠機能，如繼續服用，不惟可使萎　的乳峯，漸漸高聳，瘦削的臀部，漸漸　腴，同時且能使憔悴的面頰，變得嬌艷欲滴，娥媚動人，增進健美。</p>

<h3>破壞生殖組織之淋病</h3>
<p>淋病一物，以其繁殖力甚速，破壞力甚大，故患淋病之人，無不終身視爲莫大之累。且其破壞之處，恒不離其生殖器組織的部分，如攝護腺炎也，精囊炎也，輸精管炎也，睪丸炎也等，無不有毁滅生殖機能之可怖。故因淋病而失孕，百分之八九十，是每個白濁患者，不可不加注意之事。宜細心偵察病象，確實證明屬於淋病何種症狀。所以在診斷方面之醫械，必須求其齊備。如尿道鏡，膀胱鏡，高倍顯微鏡，載物玻璃等，俱不可少，蓋診斷明白，猶如在戰爭上對敵方偵察敵情虚實，及其匿藏之所在地，此等情形既明，然後出奇致勝，庶幾敵爲我擒。治療淋病，亦猶是也。先用科學方法，診斷病情所在，然後用科學方法，作徹底之根治，於是雖極其頑固而難治之白濁，亦不足畏矣！在根的種種能使生殖毁滅之白濁，則德國希氏血淸，其殺菌能深入組織，並可增强抗淋禦毒之能力，其效力優於一切血淸及色素針劑。可以代替一切手術。而一方更用德國樂根納博士最新發明之濾淋平流電療法，以導子插入尿道內，則雖頑强之淋菌，决難抵抗此種透射之電力，故尤能發揮希氏血淸殺菌之功效。更能能濾淸由淋菌所産生之毒素，故濾淋電療，爲最進歩之電療，並世無二。已爲泰西各大花柳病院所採用。凡各種破壞生殖組織之淋毒，可短期治愈，並保證恢復生殖能力。</p>

<h3>金融　外銀行限制外滙掉期　七月期貨轉賣驟旺　現貨掉期愈見軋攏　已難引起套利興趣</h3>
<p>昨日外匯市况、匯豐掛牌、仍無變動、暗市情勢、雖日行曾來吸收、兼洋行界亦略有結款、無如外商銀行、供源暢旺、致結果又告英平美略帶硬、七月份期貨、頗形鬆濫、蓋一般範圍較大之外商銀行、因目睹黑市塲一般現鈔枯短及無實力之中西投機商、轉向期貨方面大肆操縱、故亟施壓力、對多方掉期、嚴加限制、因之多方陡起恐慌、華行曁西商沙遜及規模較小之外商銀行等、競相出籠、加以洋行七月份有餘額頭寸者、亦來復出、致英金價曾鬆至六便士半、美滙亦一度硬達十二元六二五、嗣以有利代津帮趁賤猛吸、故形勢稍見回軟、是以現貨與本月底掉期愈見軋攏、照目前掉期英金祇貼進一二五、美匯僅二五、約合月息除佣為二分四厘光景、而套利者實際上祇一分五厘強（以二十五天計算）然照以上利率、在現鈔短少期中、恐難引起套利者之興趣、交易現貨清淡、七月期貨頗旺、至港匯因外行賣興仍濃、終亦再長一二五、</p>
<p>期貨市况大鬆</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期回長一二五、遠期則平、紐約銀價未更、倫敦生金仍平、匯兌英對美·對滬俱無變化、對法大零六二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英匯計六便士五六二五、美匯為十二元七八一二五、較之隔昨均無上落、開後洋行雖扒、兼日行對於英金亦起吸收、但英美各銀行供源仍旺、故無變化、計日行與洋行相繼扒進滙豐·華比·有利現貨英金六便士五六二五、繼洋行又購結某行現貨美滙十二元七八一二五、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉、仍無升降、及白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免徵、時因華行復來拋售七月加以外行納胃呆滯、而賣意則佳、致市勢續告鬆硬、計華行東亞等及外行華比競相塞予日行與華商七月份英金由六便士四零六二五、硬至四三七五、嗣外行荷蘭售予同行有利七月份美滙為十二元半、後西商沙遜與英行滙豐亦起競相猛塞七月美匯、致市熱愈硬、計沙遜與滙豐相繼吐予美行七月份美滙為十二元五三一二五及五六二五、後洋行亦來復吐七月份多頭、致為狀更硬、計洋行塞予外行七月份英金為六便士半、兼同月份美匯為十二元六二五、將近午刻、外行互做、現貨美匯為十二元八一二五、時港匯亦稍帶硬、外行對於現貨價四十四元三七五、均有供意、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金六便士五六二五、美匯十二元八一二五、（洋行對於以上美匯收價、多數恐難購結）</p>

<h3>外匯期貨雖硬　現金轉向高峯推進　港帮爭進不已　頓感求逾於供</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、雖匯市七月份內盤續硬、但經營者則置諸不顧、市勢逐步堅挺、蓋津帮賣意已不十分濃厚、兼華南香港帮等採辦續不間斷、於是散戶脫售之心驟淡、以致頭寸頻感求過於供、市價遂向高峰推進、終以當日最高峰之二千五百七十六元收盤、結果軋漲十六元、中途絕少迴顧、交易平平、全日祇七百兩光景、銀樓飾金隨之步高二元、海關金與中英純金等依舊呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤暗市漲十六元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開雖證券帮賣意殷濃、但因香港帮又委託某錢兌業及某銀樓頻來吸購、市勢極形穩定、茲由證券帮賣予某錢兌業五十兩、價二千五百六十元、較之前收未分榮辱、俄某銀樓吸進錢兌業五十兩、價六十二元、稍頃又高一元、金號互做五十兩、價六十三元、嗣某銀樓又進證券帮百兩、價六十二元、時某銀號亦起買風、潛勢愈堅、進證券帮五十兩、價竟抬高三元為六十五元、未幾某銀號即原價復吐予某錢兌業五十兩、價則相同、後稍回跌一元、某掮客吐予某錢兌業五十兩、價為六十四元、此後塲內一度沉寂、近午又堅挺、抬升二元某錢兌業獲利復吐予某銀樓五十兩、六十六元為午收價、午後初開尚平、首由錢兌業進現金號五十兩價仍六十六元、後塲內沉寂殊久、二時半後某金號復代華南帮傾購、且賣戶奇缺、漲勢驟熾、一剎那飛升四元、某金號進錢兌業五十兩、價為七十元、時買風仍盛、又猛抬六元、某金號進銀樓帮五十兩、價七十六元、此後買方仍有納胃、奈售者觀望、致難成交、故晚收仍作二千五百七十六元、結果比上日軋漲十六元、全天十六元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價二千五百八十五元、收進二千五百七十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>銀樓師金步高二元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初無變更、迨至午時二十分、因烚赤潛勢堅挺、故亦掛大一元、後三時半又高一元、計大同行改懸二百六十一元、新同行為二百五十九元、收進二百五十三元、</p>
<p>中英純金屹立不動</p>
<p>五日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊穩定無變故每盎斯仍為七鎊八先令六辦士半、致中央銀行之各行市價、悉無更動、計中國現金收買價為一千二百十二元六角、掛牌海關金為二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價為一千二百〇七元九角、</p>

<h3>黑匯市塲一綫光明　限制七月期掉八月期　此後是否只有現貨買賣　要看事實能否照此做去</h3>
<p>自財政部馬電限制提存付現後，本報對於其原則自表贊同，但對於工商業正當需要，如無補救辦法，及外滙無新的措施，即黑滙跌至一辦士，某方仍可撈摸，但欲外滙有辦法，非取得國外方面之有力同情的帮助不可，自見英國下議院議員屢以是否維持中國法幣為問，尤其是本月四日西門財相答復議員之詢問有云：</p>
<p>「就英國本身利益而論，更就經濟上金融上與中國具有關係之其他各國之利益着想，中國法幣之穩定，實為政府所重視。又以云中國法幣之穩定，具有重要關係，此　余已言之，特將來吾人採取何種措置，則未便有所宣述。」</p>
<p>由此視之，英國對於中國法幣跌落百分之二十五後之滙價，終必出以維持之一途。但如出以無限制一味放任之黑滙市塲，勢必蹈已往之覆轍，某一方面不論任何價格，仍將於期貨上活動，一般投機者亦可紛紛轉向期貨方面操縱，滙市終無由節制，昨日本地範圍較大之洋銀行，有鑒於此，突然限制八月期貨掉期，七月分仍可照常買賣，惟七月期欲掉八月期，除範圍較小之外商銀行在可能範圍內仍許其掉期外，此外無論何方一律拒絕，現一般投機者存款，多數存於較大之外商銀行，而小範圍外商銀行，自身亦受現鈔束縛，决無操縱之可言，此舉予投機者以絕大壓力，多方不得不忍痛斬絕，此誠維持中國法幣之一有力辦法也，果能完全實現，則此後外滙，僅有現市，而無期貨，現貨需現鈔，只要將現鈔收束，現貨外滙之活動勢將有限，或許外滙進出，逐漸移轉於華方銀行，亦未可知，且觀其後。</p>
<h3>印銀猛跌十一安那　遠期亦續降　大條轉堅穩</h3>
<p>五日倫敦電、銀市印度及投機家進出兼營、進者知足、市面平定、收盤後、平而帶呆、近期缺少供給、印度照掛牌價買進遠期、大條銀、近期回長一二五、遠期勿動、紐約銀電、美現貨仍站原價、又孟買銀電、印銀市况疲軟、現貨與七月又猛跌十一安那、八月亦續降八安那、成交單共計五十張、</p>
<h3>貼現低二元半　拆息仍掛二角</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、轉迥為低、每千元初曾昂過一百元光景、但不久即低至九十五元、下午更不支、退為九十二元半、比前日回低二元半、至錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍掛　角未更云、</p>
<h3>英美金票回漲</h3>
<p>昨日英純金與英美匯兌俱未更動、本埠外匯洋行結款尚殷、外銀供給暢達、美匯拋塞更盛、市况英平美硬、英匯仍為六便士五六二五、美匯為十二元八一二五、較上日續鬆〇三一二五、粭赤開盤穩定、為二千五百六十元、嗣金號客戶等濃厚、市况頗堅、午收為六十六元、午後散戶錢兌業等吸納更殷、供給稀少、市價高挺、未見回風、一般投機者、見歐洲局勢武裝和平、衝突或可避免、頗為興奮、晚收為二千五百七十六元、較上日漲十六元、外幣英美金鎊、因烚赤高漲、市價堅挺、英美金票需要甚殷、市價上騰、外匯英平而美鬆、今外幣上升、殷富收藏、未因限制提存而稍　、香港法郎安南等票、俱有需要、皆趨上升、日金票供求頗均、變動甚微、晚市為九角九分三厘、朝鮮票呆滯、為八角七分二厘、公會交易稀少、鴻昌出勤泰進英金票五十鎊、又出永泰進英金票二十鎊、昨日市價、英金鎊升四角、英金票升五分、美金鎊升二角、美金票升二分五厘、香港票升五厘、法郎票升一厘二毫半、新加坡票安南票各升二分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>證券　公債漲風　銳不可當</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况繼續飛漲、頗為遒勁、自開市後、連漲三日、計共回高三元餘至六元一角、若以最低最高計、已回上九元之譜、退銳進速、理正相等、其關鍵祇在本息之有無着落、刻下市塲傳說、咸云本息發生變化墳匯劃、不成問題、而一般驚弓之鳥、為慎重計、仍以未見正式明文為疑、故市塲仍不乏賣戶、昨初開時、即見猛漲一元、更以天生聯和德孚協大及潤利等號搜購不已、補空及做多一時紛起、市價扶搖直上、協大對於甲種進胃極濃、頃刻即衝出六十元大關、繼續進至六十一元外、乙種亦至五十一元外、丙種已逼近五十元大關、漲勢過暴已與環境情形不相吻合、引起多頭之出籠、松茂興元求售頗殷、散戶賣出亦多、旋即回至六十元關口、大漲小回在所不免、尤須環境情形相輔佐、前途因做多已無多大希望、補空恐亦不甚亟亟、故或有回風也、市價結果、續漲一元五角半至二元一角、成交總數約共七十萬元之譜、今日停市一天、茲列簡明表於後、類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日統甲　六一·二〇五九·〇〇六〇·一〇漲二·一〇統乙　五一·二〇五〇·八〇五一·〇〇又一·六〇統丙　四九·八〇四八·七〇四九·六〇又一·五五統丁　四八·八〇四八·四〇四八·八〇又一·七五統戊　四九·四〇四八·五〇四九·一五又一·五五</p>
<p>股票市况、南洋烟草股五十股、成交價八元二角、衆業公所報告、昨日股市續甚呆滯、雖見有買戶出價低廉、但賣戶稀少、怡和股穩定、價約十八元半、電車股尚有需求、價三十九元半、橡皮股市甚疏忽、成交寥寥、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月五日（週五）掛牌行市、僅有少數上落、英德續英發及中法美金有印各跌一鎊、前者為四十七鎊、後者為四十五鎊、善後英發獨升半鎊、價為三十三鎊半、其餘不動、買賣行市、善後英發為三十三鎊五先令、又德發有印為二十七鎊五先令、上日成交、計善後英發二千鎊、做開價三十二鎊十七先令六便士、照作市微撳二先令六便士、本日實貨求售、善後英金二千五百鎊、售價三十三鎊半、平行市、又法發有印二千鎊、售價三十鎊半、照英發撳落三鎊、</p>

<h3>紗花　銀根緊迫實銷岑寂　棉紗跌風加厲</h3>
<p>紗市續趨下降、且跌風未投機皮球交易殊難發展、同時鈔票貼現率高昂、致客銷岑寂、加之各路交通阻梗、運輸不暢、市盤遂成衰敗之象、而一般般富者、囤積之貨、仍不動生色、市面賴以支持一步、二十支雙馬外棧貨敲破四百八十元關口、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、同業仍來維持、開價小二元、二十支雙馬為四百八十三元、成交三十包、棧單價為四百七十八元、客帮祇有問詢探聽、少頃因買者缺之、跌風復熾、雙馬外棧貨逐步跌至四百七十八元、但實際生意仍屬平常、後同行某戶略為收進幾包、微見回好一二元、收盤價二十支雙馬為四百七十九元半、棧單價為四百七十五元半、查全日各帮買去統計七百七十五包、行情　十支雙馬跌五元半、雙地球跌四元半、牧羊跌五元、二十支粗紗跌一·二元不等、查棉紗昨由寗波來三百件、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<p>日紗市面忽然下墮、趨勢甚弱、蓋以實銷缺乏、又以銀根緊迫、有此兩因、紗市不振之故也、二十支月琴紗現貨價為三百九十三元、比上日跌十元之譜、</p>
<h3>本棉交易　漸見起色　外棉定貨時有將　全部貨款付清說</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初以同業購買及空頭抵補、同時孟買及利物浦來電良好而略漲一二磅音、華盛頓方面對於農業救濟金、雖早已議決、棉花出口津貼亦已確定、惟不予公佈、詳情無從探悉、因之同業又轉抱觀望、棉區氣候報告良好、新花生長亦屬進步、同業預測本年度新花竟有一千二百萬者、故昨日紐約跌三四磅音、印度連同預測漲起一羅比餘、埃及漲二十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日趨靜寂、各方需棉雖殷、惟籌款不易、祇能暫時觀望、洋行方面做新交易、以市價現已太高、危險過巨、故竟須於定貨時將全部貨款付清之說、惟以目前尚無新交涉、故未能證實此說、總之將來做新交易、困難殊多也、</p>
<p>本棉交易漸行起色、但成交額量仍微渺、同業辦進雖暢、但多轉傳於他廠交解之貨、華廠未有動辦也、青島某廠某號代辦外棉裝運之說、棉市情形、受紗市不振原因而稍挫、蘇北來源僅到通州花一百零一包、又由北沙來四百八十四件、茲將現棉做妥之盤列左、</p>

<h3>糧食　麵粉沉靜　新小麥仍少交易</h3>
<p>現粉市况、沉靜如常、南北兩帮之客銷、仍以天津時局及現鈔問題、進胃不佳、市上雖傳有整批客銷之接談、而事實上迄未成議、蓋廠方亦未肯過於遷就求脫也、統市交易、僅恃本街一路、成交額僅六七千包、二號粉仍站四元六角半現鈔、市面尚在擯持中、</p>
<p>新小麥來源、絡繹不絕、惟因各產地時有封境、未能暢通、故到貨為數不多、執貨者莫不堅守待機、昨日本街囤戶、續有問津、日商與日廠亦均已開手採辦、惟值粉銷清淡之際、均有抑價而取之意、而貨主則不肯廉售、結果雙方仍無交易、</p>
<h3>厚薄粳無上落　變元小去二三角</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源、河下仍無到頭、車輪到楓涇九車、數計一千一二百包、到貨雖屬有限、而銷塲亦見平常、內地帮旣未動辦、而本街店胃並見轉遜、致市面復呈疲軟之氣、不過售方心思尚堅、扳持殊力、故結果厚薄粳行情、無甚上落、惟獨蘇同帮容家頗願脫手、是以價格貶去角許、杜洋尖埠尖去路亦屬不暢、呈平疲之象、客尖本街祇銷特貨、中次者因內地帮未有動辦、銷路較呆、並呈軟象、間有降低角許者、變元雖久無到、但存底尚豐、且有洋糯相軋、際此落令之間、市况愈疲、團粒香港糯、衹開十九元八角、尖粒開十九元出零、悉較前市甩小二三角矣、</p>
<h3>洋客秈一致下跌</h3>
<p>客秈　昨日內地帮去胃銳减、鄉荘本街亦多觀望、行囤更少問津、蓋邇日銀根奇緊、法幣枯乏、且以各地戒嚴與天熱不易久儲、消量益見稀少、統市成交不逾二千包、行情立被撳落一二角、</p>
<p>洋米　昨被本客秈價跌影響、去化亦見沉寂、統市配開現西貢一百多包、價二十三元、又比前市回小一角半、且傳新有一號西貢六百噸成交、價為二十一元云、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆餅之漲　如曇花一現　豆油貶價求售</h3>
<p>豆餅市况、在　期二（四日）曾一度　　、漲風頗熾、但去路不免呆滯、致前昨兩日、賣氣籠罩、復告下游、昨計做開大連源記餅三千片、價為三元零三分至二分、雜牌餅四千片、價為三元零一分半至三元、銷塲仍係內地居多云、</p>
<p>豆油因到存兩充、人心疲軟、且有一部份簍裝油、抵埠後因堆棧缺乏地位、仍儲天外、貨主兜售甚亟、不得不出於貶價一途、故行市跌去八九角不等、花生油先平後升、計成交膠州生油一百五十件、價為三十三元及三十三元五角、豆油做開膠州四百件、三十二元、烟歧二百件、三十二元七角、青歧二百件、三十二元四角、大連桶油成交十桶、四十五元五角、因今日休市一天、故昨日收市時、略形帶緊、</p>
<h3>絲茶綠茶存貨不充　市面堅穩如故</h3>
<p>昨日綠茶各荘行家、對於廠製各種綠茶、雖因歐洲郵船今日開出、不急需購、進意略淡、但市上存貨枯薄、溫甬兩路來源斷絕、人心仍在堅定中、全市計由協和錦隆寶隆同孚等行買進抽芯珍眉等貨、共達三百七十餘箱、抽芯頂盤做開三百四十五元、統珍　盤做開二百七十八元、價與前無甚上落、查寗波昨來茶葉一百〇四件、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤昂騰　國糖帶緊</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、荷赤為聯營處開出轉口五千包、劃盤為十六元、此前突升一元、即刻開通、勢甚俏利、蓋以心預測、後市尚看續升、二四號粗砂本棧呌廿九元七角、外棧廿九元五角、轉口廿一元三角、成交三百包、荷赤現貨廿一元六角、本一號白廿九元五角、二號白廿九元、太B嘜西棧三十元〇二角五、東棧又三十元〇五分、CW二十包、CX廿九元七角、DY廿九元二角、HX廿九元、H赤二十元〇五角、本一號冰三十五元五角、晶明冰三十七元、查港電荷電俱無更動、惟倫敦電八月份小七五、為八便士一七五、十二月升二五、為六便士七五、三月份升二五、為六便士二五、國糖勢亦帶緊、計潮帮開出高漳刁青數百包、十七元五角、建帮開提青一百五十包、為十九元至十八元九角、次南江青軟坯一百十七包、十六元、潼州赤八十九包、十五元、</p>
<h3>統計　二十八年六月　上海市工人生活費指數</h3>
<p>頃據工部局公報載本年六月上海市工人生活費指數如下：戰事以來，本市工人生活費指數，逐步高漲，本月指數又達新高峯，本過去七個月中，連續上升，與日俱增，本年一月份計漲四·一七點，二月一·六三點，三月一·九六點，四月〇·九九點，五月八·六二點，本月份又漲一一·二八點，本月指數為一七六·一五，較上月漲百分之六·八四，較去年同月漲百分之一五·四八，較戰前民國二十五年指數，計漲百分之七六·一五，本月指數之倒數為五六·七七，故本月國幣一元之購買力，適當戰前民國廿五年國幣五角六分七　七　。</p>
<p>本月分類指數與上月相比，食物類指數增百分之一〇·九四，雜項類增百分之六·〇三，燃料類增百分之三·八二，衣着類則减百分之四·二一。　（未完）</p>

<p>疾病過程之中，病者類需「忌口」而當熱病初期，口胃未變之際，尤須注意，設悍然不禁，恣與飲啖，最能增病。考之傷寒論，於第一方桂枝湯後，有：「禁生冷，黏滑，肉，麵，五辛，酒，酪，臭惡等物之文，茲試分繹如次：</p>
<p>（一）生冷，黏滑　傷寒表病發熱，是抵禦外寒體溫反射之候，體工重心，趨向於外，胃腸空虛，內部安和，乃可驅邪達外。若當此時，誤食生冷，胃受寒冷刺激，或黏滑腥膩之物，遏鬱中焦，胃旣難於消化，體工起而救濟，潰於外圍，轉趨向裏，於是表裹合邪而內陷。</p>
<p>（二）肉酪　二物富於脂肪，脂肪入體，產生熱量，體溫必增，而不能放散，於是熱盛；且油膩之品，胃腸之消化吸收，咸較困難，每易引起陽明之結。</p>
<p>（三）五辛，臭惡五辛爲　韭等物，皆有特殊之重濁氣味，易於刺激胃壁，引起嘔噁，目其性柔溫而濁，實不到於熱病之已化熱者。</p>
<p>（四）麵酒　麵食發氣，難於消化，且含有鹼質。酒則體陰而用陽，初服興奮增熱，繼即濕濁戀中，易化痰熱，以增病</p>
<h3>傷寒病後</h3>
<p>— 吳善慶</p>
<p>傷寒病退之初，最關重要之問題，厥唯調攝，調攝之道，尤以節制飲食爲急務，蓋此病之癥結，胃腸爲其病灶，消化機能，未經恢復，往往由積滯而薰蒸，由薰蒸而復熱，故在傷寒病之過程中，固當忍饑耐餓，即在病退之際，亦當愼密防微，須待熱退身凉，脈和苔凈，方可少少進食，以養胃氣，若有餘熱，脈猶不和，而苔色乾燥焦枯，甚而起有刺芒，此由胃熱未除，祗可飲以開水，雖欲索食，不可驟進，早食過飽，必致食復。</p>
<p>初愈欲進飲食，宜頻而不宜多，先進淸粥，次進濃粥，再次漸進糜粥，切勿任意多食，以防積滯，至於甘美厚味，一切肉食，必待解過硬粪，大便通調如常者，方可漸次而進，亦不可貪口腹，飽食無節，佐以蘿蔔湯，乾菜湯，有疎腸和胃之效能也，渴則可飲細芽茗茶，饑則可巡開水冲雞蛋，或牛肉汁雞汁之類，有力者，或用燕窩煮粥，以資補肺滋陰，無力者，或用菉荳煮粥，薏苡仁煮粥，以助淸然解毒。</p>
<h3>傷寒後不忌葷</h3>
<p>— 金哲明</p>
<p>一般病家對於傷寒病接，差不多個個能恪守「忌口」的條件，魚腥蝦蟹等大葷，當然－雜摒絕，就是小葷像肉鬆一類，也不大多吃，其實他們還沒有澈底明瞭「病後忌口」的眞義，所謂「忌口」二字，一則不是不許吃東西，不過是暗示督促病家謹愼選擇，適宜的食物，不可亂吃和漫無節制的飽食而已，還有一種傷寒病後「忌口」，不是忌的葷腥，不能濫吃許多不消化的素菜，要知道傷寒一症，吃了大頭菜甜醬瓜香椿頭，如果不吐渣，這類素菜不但沒有豐富的滋養料，而且消化也極困難，病勢很容易引起復發，其實雞湯雞汁和牛肉湯牛肉汁，雖然是葷腥，的確可以代償已經耗損的體力和榮養，許多人病後吃了雞汁牛肉汁，身體往往發肥，要知道一切固體食物都在禁止範圍之中，一切液體東西不論葷素可以在所不忌，肯定一些說「傷寒病後的忌口，並不在於葷和素的差別，在於固體和液體的問題。」</p>
<h3>濕溫傷寒　發生白㾦之調治</h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>濕溫傷寒，所以發生白瘠之原因，說者不一。有謂濕宜淸利，治不得法，則遏鬱於胸膈之間，爲熱所蒸，如麴蘖之蘊釀，化爲白瘖；苟早用淡淬之法，使濕從小便而出，白瘩自無從發生矣。有謂病在最初不用解表之發汗藥，濕蘊於內，無路可通，遂化爲白瘖，仍從皮膚而外達。然發生白瘖之部位，以胸項爲最多，小腹偶亦延及，至頭面四肢，可稱絕無僅有，若謂早期治不得法，則所受之影響，决無限於軀幹之理，其說不無可疑。</p>
<p>又有最新穎之一說，則謂白瘖之發生，必與淋巴腺有關，白瘖中所含之液體，乃淋巴腺液，而非通常所指炎性分泌物之「濕」。淋巴腺雖體內隨處可見，而淋巴液與血液會合之處，則在胸部之鎖骨下靜脈。如受病理之影響，其會合之處，發生障碍，則外透而爲白瘖，凡透白瘠之人，必有胸睆痞悶之現象，即以此故。說雖動聽，但亦未能證實耳。</p>
<p>白瘖發生以後，於病理上所起之變化，頗不一致。症情較輕者，漸次熱退身安；共重者，雖透白瘖，病勢亦毫無變動；至一見白瘖而反成爲危症者，亦時有見之，一般人之見解，以爲濕溫傷寒能透白瘖爲佳兆，白瘖一透，病暢機達，可以轉危爲安；故以白瘠之有無，而斷病情之利害，此實大誤，惟白瘖透後，病機得轉輕者爲佳兆，如病機不轉，或反見沉重者，證情必甚纏綿。診斷上之注意點，在於白瘖既透之後，病情轉變如何，不在於白瘖之透不透也。</p>
<p>白瘖之用藥問題，有主張急於養陽者，實際上亦不一定，仍宜隨證情而施治；故調理之法，亦當相機應變。第一，室中不宜過悶，衣被不宜過暖，以免阻碍肌膚之排泄及體溫之放散。胸脇痞滿者，項下鈕扣，可以使其寬鬆，俾得舒適。白瘖與痧痘等之保護法略有不同，熱度之高者。不必愼藏密處。稍求凉爽，理亦無碍。白瘖見而病機不轉，食物仍在禁例。若熱勢漸次减輕，確已日趨佳境者，可由粥湯而逐漸改爲稀粥，以至飯食，助餐之品，亦可由素菜而遂漸改爲葷食。飲料一項以橘子汁爲最美，他如蘆根湯，靑蒿露，金銀花露，有化濕清熱之功，皆可用之。</p>
<p>白瘠以滿綻光潤而如水晶者爲佳，證情雖重，正氣未衰，抵抗力仍極充足，如調理得法，不難恢復健康。其枯暗無光者，正氣大虛，縱熱勢已减，纏綿留戀，一時决難全愈，以此而轉入虛損之途者，時有見之。法當以安靜爲然一要義，如食慾不减者，不妨稍進滋養之流質，以補充其體元，亦有入晚則收，晨起又綻，往復不已者，尤當使其安睡，勿與多談而勞其神，勿使起坐而勞其力；其在小兄，看護者可伴之同眠，俾得充分休養，則白瘖必滿綻充潤，一經收歛亦不再往復矣。</p>
<h3>橘子</h3>
<p>— 陳蒼</p>
<p>橋爲秋冬佳果，我國以粵　所產者良；其實全部，可供療疾，略述如後：</p>
<p>肉：性溫味甘酸，功能潤肺止咳，除胸中隔氣，並助消化。製汁人蜜調羹，味更甘美，便閉者飲之，有潤腸通腑之效。傷寒病中可飲橘汁。</p>
<p>皮：產於粤者爲廣皮，或稱新會皮；產於閩者爲橋皮，以晒乾陳久者良，故亦稱陳皮。味苦辛性溫，主行氣健胃，去濕化痰，療嘔穢反胃嘈雜，爲宜通疏利之要藥。如以橋皮去白，名橘紅，治外感咳嗽，利氣消痰，兼有透發之功。若去紅留白，謂之橘白，亦具芳香和胃之長。</p>
<p>絡：活血利氣，舒通絡道；煎湯飲服，能治口渴吐酒。</p>
<p>核：療小腸疝氣，及陰核腫痛等症，但效甚微小。</p>
<p>除上述外，橘葉亦入藥，功能消腫散毒，肝氣病常用之</p>
<h3>枇杷與甘蔗</h3>
<p>— 鄒德民</p>
<p>枇杷爲喬木類，高丈餘，葉長橢形，　齒甚細，背有褐色毛，甚密。夏初實熟，形圓色黃，味甘酸，皮有細毛，產於洞庭白沙者最佳，色較白，味甘美，而少酸味，亦有紅色絞大者，稱爲大紅袍，尙可口，枇杷葉功能治咳化痰，淸熱潤肺，藥舖取以熬膏，並將其葉蒸露，以療咳嗽，但用其葉時須刷去其毛，否則反能致咳，枇杷膏感冒初起咳嗽，固不甚宜，稍久之咳，食之尙有小功效，亦水果中之有益者也。</p>
<p>甘蔗爲果類，市上有廣東產。塘西產一種，塘西產性凉潤，皮色紫而矮，汁少味校淡，皆爲製糖之原料，爲除熱生津澗燥之妙品。並能通大小腸，利小便，凡患傷寒溫病，熱邪內燔，刦傷津液，腸胃失潤，舌綠燥者，蔗漿一物，列爲要藥。但須用紫皮者佳，又小兒痧子之後，亦爲要品，惜紫皮者，產源不多，非若靑皮者。充斥市上也，故購之較難爲憾。</p>
<h3>蘿蔔</h3>
<p>— 鄒德民</p>
<p>萊菔（卽蘿蔔）爲蔬菜中之一種，形有長圓色分紅白。春季結實較小。謂之楊花萊菔，取糖醋浸之，加以麻醬油拌食，香腌適口。生食性屬辛甘，熟食則無辛味。常人多視爲佐膳之品，豈知在醫藥上亦至有效用也。茲臚述如下。</p>
<p>（一）咳嗽　凡患咳嗽，稍久不愈，而無寒熱者，用萊菔搗汁，合飴糖，或加款冬花少許燉服。萊菔含有揮發性，功能止咳化痰，寬中降氣，飴糖冬花，亦爲潤肺和中之劑，如法連服數次，自易見效。</p>
<p>（二）喉痛　風痰壅塞，喉間腫痛，萊菔合靑果（橄欖）煎湯，名靑龍白虎湯，服之有宣風化痰，淸熱解毒之功。又萊　英（即萊菔一端之菜葉）曝乾煎茶，可助治一切喉症。）</p>
<p>（三）化痰　熱病多痰，瀰漫胸膈及肺胃之間，咳喘痰鳴，甚至昏迷不甦。用藥固須竹瀝，天竹黃，貝母，遠志等。淸化開豁。若佐以萊菔汁。入藥和服，收效史偉。</p>
<p>藥舖所售之地骷髏，功能宣肺化痰，即乾枯之萊菔也。又世人每謂萊菔能解藥性，在服藥期內，視爲禁物；蓋生食令人噯氣，多食令人作鰽，服藥時慮其泄氣，而减遜補劑」藥力，固以不食爲是，普通藥劑並無解藥作用。熟食非特不解藥性，抑且和胃降濁，輔助消化。在天氣亢燥時食之，並可預防喉症。其子名爲萊菔子，各藥店均有出售，爲化痰消食之妙品也。</p>

<h3>便秘治法</h3>
<p>— 朱作三</p>
<p>常習性便秘，婦女界患者爲多，蓋婦女血分易於虧耗，則津液虛，不得潤澤，而大便時閉：是血虛爲本也．故於治法脾血虛燥結者，益血潤腸丸，津液枯涸者，蓯蓉丸，五仁丸；，弱者，麻仁丸；風秘者，火麻仁丸；火結者，更衣丸；濁陰不降者，通幽湯；諸多成方，類用大黃，郁李，蘆薈等淸降通達之藥，以戟刺腸管，使蠕動亢進而外，更必參以麻仁，當歸，蓗蓉等養血滋潤，以使腸腺之分泌增加，潤滑管腔及其內容物質而能流利耳。</p>
<p>外治之法，係專爲對證大腸而發，取其潤降之性，而不疲弱胃氣者，仲景有蜜煎導與猪膽汁導二法，前者實與令之甘油栓塞坐劑相同，後者亦與皂水灌腸法類似。又凡苦便秘者，對於日常飲食，亦宜有所注意，蔬菜如白菜。蘿蔔。菠菜等，旣富各種營養素，又多纖維素，亦足以增加腸之蠕動；菓品如橘子。香蕉。梨子等，富有液質，潤腸之外，更有各種生活素，可資補益，故皆宜常食至辛辣之調味劑，如薑椒等物，易於動火增燥，遠之爲宜。（存仁按稿中所述丸藥及蜜煎導，國藥號有出售）</p>

<h3>精練水師</h3>
<p>中國擬在英國購買現成鐵甲船一艘，價銀在九十萬兩之譜，按此船即不如歐洲之最美者，亦可爲雄船也。大抵再逾二月，便可前來中國。但旣有此器，貴有用器之人，此誠爲中國之難耳。按天下各國，以水師稱雄者，莫英國若也。俄普奧東洋各國皆派人往學，我國何不效法他國乎。今福州會設有訓練水師之處，此固第一良法。查現今各兵船所藉司駕者，不過外國各貨船上之人，及曾在貨船之華人水手耳。即能遵循海濱以行駛，亦鮮有能測日躔知星度，而詳悉行船之法者，故欲共出大洋焉難矣！且僅習於貨船之規，豈能明戰艦之制乎。故萬不可以大局承平，水師各員弁，克沿海濱，供給載官裝貨，遂目以爲可收效於戰爭也。</p>

<h3>小學教員在暑期中　兩個月的失業</h3>
<p>— 洛爾</p>
<p>希望仍照發微薄的「薪金」</p>
<p>下學期也應該增加才好呀</p>
<p>一遇這朋友，他們就會打趣似地對我說：「放暑假啦！哈哈！有兩個月的休息啦！」我聽了朋友那話，總是臉上裝出一種勉強的笑容，而在內心中呢，却有着一種說不出的苦楚。我曾回答：「是的，是的，我們校裏是放了暑假了。」</p>
<p>的確如我的那位朋友所說的：放了暑假，我會有兩個月的休息了麼？事實上却並不然，兩個月的「暑假」，在我，這個可憐的小學教員，就是一種「失業」的美麗的代名詞呀！</p>
<p>小學教員在社會的地位上，較之測字先生，是略勝一籌的，這是我們幾個同病相憐的同事，常常這樣說起的。上海成為「孤島」後，上海的所謂「教育事業」，由「恐慌」而一達成為「繁榮」，照理，我們小學教員，是應該也可以闊一闊，抖一抖了。可是事實呢，又是並不然！</p>
<p>當上海戰爭時，以及國軍撤退後不久，上海的所謂「教育事業」，正在極度的「恐慌」之中，讀者一定還可以想到：在牆壁上，我們不是可以看到「經濟小學每月一元」，這種可憐的招貼麼？那時候一般的小學校長們，實在是苦憐得使人們不期然會抱一掬同情之心的。而小學教員們呢，在那時，只要食宿有所，也就心坦氣安了。</p>
<p>可是，這種「恐慌」的情形，是跟着「孤島」社會的畸形發展，而漸漸地「繁榮」起來了，小學校長，一變而成為「天之驕子」了。而我們小學教員呢，還是依然故我。像狗呌猴子跳，一天忙到晚，十六隻老洋一個月，已經算是小學教員輩中的「佼佼」者了！</p>
<p>我們當然看得校長先生那末飛黃騰達是眼紅的，我們曾經要求過校長先生加我們一二元的所謂「薪金」，但是回答的是不睬和白眼。我們當然也不敢再提那種話了，我們深深地曉得：「小學教員」的「產業後備軍」，在這失業者比比皆是的「孤島」上，不是正在伺窺一個機會麼？</p>
<p>上海的生活程度是一天一天的增高了，我們的「實質工資」，可說是相反地在减少。十六隻老洋，在現在，已成為十元左右了。像我這個獨生漢是還好，我有幾個同事，或家有妻小，或家有父母，這樣，十元左右的「實質工資」，在生活程序日高的上海灘上，怎能生活呢？讀者只要一閉眼睛，替我們這批小學教員想一想，我們這種生活不是太像牛馬了麼？</p>
<p>現在，我們學校是放暑假了，假期有兩月，在這兩月中，是沒有「薪金」的。我們怎敢要求校長先生呢？下學期聘請我們，已是我們的大幸了，我們還敢妄加「奢求」麼？</p>
<p>曾經記得校長先生勉勵我們道：「努力，在這非常暑期之中，德國的小學教員，在第一次的世界大戰之中，不是已表現出他們很大的力量了麼？」</p>
<p>雖然社會上對我們小學教員是蔑視的，但我們是時刻記得我們的天責的。</p>
<p>可是，不能因為那樣，而不養活我們自己和我們的家呀</p>
<p>正因為我們的天責是重大，校長先生旣因「孤島」發展畸形，而學校事業大為發達，那末，不應該在「團結互助」之中，給我們小學教員以合理的待遇麼？</p>
<p>現在雖然已放暑假，但我向全上海的小學校長先生們呼籲，幫助平日替你們狗呌猴子跳的夥計們，在暑期中，仍照發可憐的微薄的「薪金」，同時，下學期起，應該酌量增加他們的「薪金」才好呀！</p>
<h3>斐爾奮鬥史</h3>
<p>— 思華</p>
<p>“The　Story　of　Alexander　Graham　Bell”</p>
<p>二十世紀福期出品　國　戲院映</p>
<p>這是為紀念電話發明家斐爾而作的。它的意義很明顯，是鼓勵這一代努力從事於發明的工作。斐爾給我們的教訓是很大的，當他發時電話的時候，他的遭遇是多麼的艱難困苦，然而他終於忍勞耐怨的幹下去，一直到成功。這反映到其它的工作，也是一樣，只要有利於社會的工作，肯刻苦地幹下去，沒有不會成功的。</p>
<p>為什麼要在現在來攝製紀念一八七三年的科學家的影片呢？</p>
<p>我在跑出戲院子時，我曾有着這樣一個聯想：世界的局面是那樣的緊張，正像吹足了汽的輕球一樣，戰爭隨時有爆發的可能，自然，每一個國家不得不有一種防範，這種防範也許做得很隱秘而不容易看出來，但在　　識里每每會今有這樣的成份。科學的發達與否，對於一個國家的強弱是大有關係的，我們不能否認目前的美國是怎樣地渴望有旣創造了電話又從鳥的飛翔而擬發明飛機的大發明家斐爾的不斷產生，即使那堅　果敢的精神也是美國所需要的。在「斐爾奮鬥史」里雖然看不到現實的世界，但却看到了美國怎樣　往於生產建設來充實他們的力量</p>
<p>劇作者為了避免紀録電影的苦燥，他相當地用羅曼斯來調劑劇中的情調；但，劇作者對於寫情的手腕並不細膩的，如斐爾和梅寶兒初次郊遊，他都沒有把握住這機會來渲染一下，只是很平淡的讓它滑過去了；尤其是劇作者不能利用梅寶兒的聾子的特點，加以趣味的描寫。自然，劇作者的主旨並不在此，他的筆尖大部還是着重在斐爾的奮鬥上面，如斐爾幾次搬家，以及他如何因飢餓過度而暈倒，這樣的寫法自然是很對的，可是也因此而顯得有些悶。</p>
<p>導演也多半着力於斐爾的艱苦工作，他　次描寫斐爾的局部成功，都相當有噱頭；但，深刻的戲却並不多。在人物的記得劃上，胡巴德的個性寫得最明顯，他頑固，守舊的影子深深地刻在觀衆的心膜上。感人的塲面，我倒以為是那啞兒呼爸爸，爸爸流淚的一塲戲最好。</p>
<p>洛麗泰陽飾梅寶兒，大體上演得很好，而以第一次和斐爾擁抱為最。不過，她沒有抓住聾女的特性，否則，她很可以發揮她的新穎的演技的。舉例來說，她的發音過低是不大合理的（在表情上自然是情感了一點），因為一個聾子調節聲韻沒有這樣靈敏。</p>
<p>唐阿曼契（斐爾）的臉部表情缺乏變化，緊張與愁悶，初戀與熱戀，都沒有顯明的分別。雖則局部說起來，有幾塲戲也還相當好的。</p>
<p>其它如飾胡巴德以及那小啞子的，都有水平以上的成績</p>
<h3>康腦脫路泉漳暑校　不收學費供給書籍</h3>
<p>— （民強）</p>
<p>二日公懷君所說的四種暑期學校，都是要收相當的學費的，此外還有一種不收學費的暑期學校，補述如下：</p>
<p>這一種義務的暑期學校，教師是在校肄業的大中學生。他們利用這長長二月的暑期，繳合熱心的同學數人，向母校商借教室數間，召集在該校附近的一般無力攻讀的貧窮孩童，借此二月的假期來灌輸他們普通的知識。學費不收，連書籍也供給他們。在這裏，恐怕有人會問，這一種義務暑期學校的經費是從那裏來的，可以說，都是由開辦這些學校的教師們合力捐助的；外界捐助他們的，當然是非常的歡迎，但是是百中無一。這一種教學的熱誠，實在是可欽可佩。可惜這一種暑期學校的數量是少得很，例如泉漳義務暑期學校（校址康腦脫路）就是一個很好的例子。教師都是由該校高中部學生担任，學費不收，書籍供給，聽說現在還在繼續招生。</p>
<p>現在，暑期已經到了。我極希望上海一般熱心教育的人們，能在這暑期中，多設立一些義務的暑期學校。</p>
<h3>雨過天情</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　勸學務農儲材為國　留強汰弱選種有塲</p>
<p>朱愛人呌老阿爹不要進去了，老年人怕傷了風。朱愛羣自詡軀體健旺，她不怕冷，但進來了，也是牙齒捉　兒相打，何家姊妹是生長在南國的，當然更受不住了。冷藏室裏面，做好了架子，那　　紙一排一排的懸掛在上面，密密層層。　塲長向朱村長說道：「這個冷藏室，幸虧建初造得很為農寬敞。當時的設計，預備別個製種塲，沒有冷藏室的，將種紙寄放在此地。但到了現在，別個製種塲，也都有了冷藏室，而我們這裏，年年所發行的種子，每歲增多，　要擴充，這冷藏　也要覺得不寬敞了。」何雙玉道：『這個屋子，要是在大熱天，進去躱一躱，比了那些都市裏的冷氣間，正要冷得多咧。』朱愛羣道：「這好比一個人到了大冰　裏去了，如此一冷一熱，究與人的身體有礙。大槪此地的工人，出出進進　了的，便不足為憂了。」葛塲長道：『所以當工人們是吃苦慣了的，所謂赴湯蹈火，在所不辭。』何　玉道『葛塲長！你這話恰恰是相反了，所謂赴湯蹈火者，正是向熱的地方去，我們現在，却是向冷的地方去。』這個挑眼兒的話，大家一想，也都笑了起來。葛塲長也笑道：『當工人的，無論冷的熱的地方都要去。這裏向寒冷的屋子裏走一走，多穿幾件衣服就是了。從前我在江西景德鎮，曾經去參觀過他們燒磁的　。燒得四　的火燙的　，工人們也得進去。他們把身上所穿的衣服，在冷水裏浸濕了，然後仍舊穿在身上。到出來時，身上的衣服也烘乾了。我因此問他們：平日你們赤膊也是慣了的，就赤了膊進去，有何不可？他們却說：赤膊反而不好，這好比把人的身體，當做燒　了。但是當初他們老不肯改良，中國工人，終是墨守舊法，到了如今，自然又當作別論了。因此不要說政治上的革命難，就是一切農工業上的革命，更加難咧。』他們談談說說，由葛塲長陪了他們一衆人，到了外面一個起居室內。葛塲長方始開言道：『我本來要來拜訪朱村長的，不為別事，就是為的本塲，明年又要小小的有所擴展，其中有幾件事，不能不同朱村長有所商酌。』（一五四）</p>
<h3>女彈詞人物誌</h3>
<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>陳月娥　與袁雲仙齊名者，有陳月娥，此持平叟所謂「色藝能兼者二人，一為陳月娥，一為袁雲仙」也。彼謂陳月娥為陳芝香之女甥，「貌美而　佳，撫弦奏曲，其音節圓而婉，靜而幽，如一縷游絲，晴空獨裊，態度亦楚楚可憐。惟善病，不甚登塲，近聞已嫁矣」。於月娥之藝，多所說明。至其人之身世，則王　「海陬冶遊録」卷四有傳。文云：</p>
<p>陳月娥，亦滬中才妓也。本舊家女子，父歿之後，無以為生，遂隸平康。少曾讀書，及長，一志詩詞，遂能吟詠。……全家數十指，悉仰給於姬一人。庶母芝香性刻酷，待之尤虐。……姬至立細軀，輕盈綽約，望之如神仙中人。性又端莊凝重，不茍言笑。……喜與文士講詩，竟　不惓。……</p>
<p>卷二中之一段，則並及陳芝香，謂「滬上女子之說平話者，稱為先生，大抵即昔之彈詞，從前北方女先兒之流也。近日如陳芝香者，尤為巨擊，誠可為陸秀　之嗣音，而足稱秀壓羣芳矣。月娥月　皆芝香之高足，均非時流望其肩背。芝香體態豐腴，風流秀曼，別具神韻。月娥風資嫣然，月箏妙齡甫　靚麗春光，尤堪蕩魄。唱時各抱樂具登塲，或繁弦急　，或曼聲長吟，其所誦七言麗句，聲如百囀春鶯，醉人心目。所說說部，口角詼諧，維妙維肖，其描摹盡致，擬議傳神，非海上裙釵所能夢見，蓋以不失之生　，即流於粗忽，忘其為女子身也。芝香之獨能擅塲者，以得此中三昧，而又體貼入微。月娥善唱小曲，章台遍歷，迄無其儔，曲終人遠，餘音　梁，真令人傾耳不置也」。是不僅對月娥，即對陳氏一門的演藝，亦闡明極多。公之放「丁丑（一八七七）上海書仙花榜」，稱月娥為「姣品」，喻之為「　　」，評之曰「超心鍊冶，着手成春」，可謂極有見地。至當時之贈詩亦極多，茲録足以說明月娥者數首於次：</p>
<p>可是蟾宮謫素娥，塵　游戲記嬌歌。水弦彈向溶溶月，凄切聲中別恨多。——刋江詞客。</p>
<p>清漆　干唱竹枝，清　早已冠當時。我來不為尋春晚，曾向花　見玉姿。</p>
<p>繡閣初開畫苑春，風流標榕迴超塵。吳宮花史無雙品，絕藝江南第一人。</p>
<p>風神采采壓羣芳，語妙如珠百斛量，譜出琵琶多逸響，要將繁露洗花光。——花月社長四首之三。</p>
<p>此外如蝶痴生等，亦皆有贈貽，然大都為一般贈妓之作，無補於對月娥之說明，不録。詞有醉墨生之「有懷陳月娥詞史」，用「浪淘沙」調。詞云：「閒坐轉無聊，金鴨香消，一燈相對可憐宵。花自含嬌人自懶。愁煞今朝。別緒總難描，寫盡　　，緘書欲寄意迢迢。昔日盟言卿意不，說也魂消」。此不過說其多情而已。（四）</p>

<h3>從影感言（上）</h3>
<p>— 秋霞</p>
<p>（編者介紹）秋霞出身歌舞界，為梅花歌舞團五虎將之一。嗣轉電影界，處女作為「父母子女」，（文化公司出品）後入明星與胡蝶合作「永遠的微笑」及戰後主演之「恐怖之夜」「桃色新聞」「孤兒救得母記」諸片，演技純熟，均獲好評。最近轉入新華公司，甫於日前簽定契約云</p>
<p>光陰真快，不知不覺在電影界，已經是虛度了四年了。常聽得俗語說：「做人難，難做人，人難做，做難人。」我過了四年的開末拉前的生活，也得到一個結論，就是：「拍戲難，難拍戲，戲難拍，拍難戲。」</p>
<p>我之所以有這十二個字杜撰的結論，乃是因為我同憶到當初剛踏進攝影塲的時候，勇氣十足，不知道天高地厚，拍戲的難處。那時候大槪是因為過去曾經過幾年舞臺生活，太沒有銀幕經騐的緣故。</p>
<p>後來，在攝影塲裹工作的日子漸漸久了，不敢說是有經騐了，祇能說戲多拍了些，倒反覺得膽子小了，因此我常覺得「越拍戲越不敢拍戲」，「越拍戲越覺拍戲難」。</p>
<p>每一個演員，戲多拍了，從經騐得來，知道拍戲容易，「精」則難。所以嚴格地說來，仍舊是拍戲難。尤其是常常看看外國片子，看到外國藝人們的出神入化的演技，真呌自己慚愧。這並不是說「長他人志氣，滅自己威風」的話，憑良心說，外國藝人們的修養與訓練是高過我們多多了。我總記得嘉寶說過：「一個演員不但要表演出情感，還要表演出　想。」在嘉寶這一句「入木三寸」的話中，就可看出外國藝人的程度了，同時也給我們一個好的借鏡，知道一個演員不僅是照了劇本，依樣葫蘆的在閒末拉於前走幾步路，或者在麥克風下說幾句話，就算完了</p>

<h3>聽言菊朋兩齣戲（下）　——最贊成兩個字——</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>今聽菊月所唱「……去把賊收」賊字，仍尊所學，未經變化，居然原樣未走，衆醉之中，有一獨醒之人；衆雞之中，有一獨立之鶴，吾耳際聽聞之下，如飲瓊漿，如獲異寶，如聽天樂，於是乎通身快活，滿腦清凉，幾若羽化而登仙界矣。不特區區快活也，當此之時，譚老先生陳十二爺在天之靈，亦必一齊點首稱贊不置，何也？譚英秀之受此字唱法於前輩先生也，在戲迷觀之，不啻周公之受道於堯舜禹湯文武二王：彥衡先生之授與吾等，直如定禮樂作春秋，今在傳人能守春秋之義而不茍焉，二公若有靈，豈有不掀髯而笑連呼吾道不孤哉！雖然，菊朋並非不改字改腔者也，彼十年來之作品，於陽平聲之各字，常改至最低音，以就嗓音矣，今於要緊去處，獨不更改，幸得保留，尤覺難能可貴，值得　揚矣。聽此一字，則其餘之腔雖唱破可也，聽此一字，則全　之字雖改至不成話說可也，何也，此一字固居然未曾更改故也。菊朋若冒然與余叔岩一路，不顧唱律，不守師傳，而遽將「賊」字改為「合四」低音，反自鳴得意，以為字正腔圓，其時小區區手無斧柯，又能按「監守自盜」之律，而學孔明之給以「四十肉棍」乎哉？（肉棍二字，是某大唱斬謖之笑談，蓋打王平時本四十棍，唱十字不清，轉入「　求」轍，幾成肉字，遂成肉棍，王平云，軍棍好挨，肉棍不好受也，借用發一笑，菊朋知此典故，必不惱上心頭也，）故曰尤值得闡揚者也。</p>
<p>洪羊洞亦老譚拿手戲之一，上塲元板「半日閒空」之「閒」字，雖係陽平，因關唱律，唱高音「尺字」，不唱「合四」低音，與空城計之賊字不能唱低之理由正同，不復詳說，吾聽菊朋第三日戲之洪羊洞，唱至「閒」字，又居然譚法之「尺」字高出之音也，（半日，言唱半點，亦好，本通用，）聽了此字唱法，真值得浮一大白，益見其空城計中唱「賊」字，不走低音，乃精心用意保存譚法之作，有此二字之可聽，便抵得兩　大戲，戲大而唱不好，不如一字之佳之痛快，吾故云然也。除此二字外，吾有千言萬語，要說而未能說，稍俟時日，吾總得一吐為快，不然，吾將悶死矣！</p>
<h3>上海電影院之鳥瞰（上）</h3>
<p>— 舒曉春</p>
<p>本市現在所有之電影院，數量方面，並不比戰前减少，雖然有若干電影院受戰事影響而不克復業，如上海，東南，東海等數家是。但多數電影院都在二租界區域內，不僅不受影響，且因本市之畸形繁榮，「客滿」牌幾常常高掛於門口，且還有新聞者如金門，滬光等三四家，即地處虹口，亦有復業者，如融光，威利等數家是。閒尚在進行聞設中者，也有二三家，茲就二租界內統計之，得大小電影院二十八家，其在虹口區域以及遊戲塲附設之電影塲，尚不在內。</p>
<p>電影院以其所映影片之先後，分為頭輪，二輪及三輪三種，影片亦可分為外片及國片二種，外片大多為美國片，聞或有蘇俄，英法等片映出，但為數頗少。在　美國影片分公司，有：華納第一國家，派拉蒙，米高　，二十世紀福克司，聯美，環球，哥倫比亞及雷電華等八家經理一切；國片則有新華，　華，華新，華成，國華，天聲，聯藝等公司，攝製供應。今將三級電影院，列表如次：</p>
<p>（一）頭輪戲院</p>
<p>甲·放映外片者——大光明，南京，國泰，大上海。</p>
<p>乙·放映國片者——金城，新光，滬光。</p>
<p>（滬光兼映蘇俄片及二輪美片）</p>
<p>（二）二輪戲院</p>
<p>甲·放映外片者——金門，麗都，巴黎，光　，平安。</p>
<p>乙·放映國片者——中央，恩派亞。</p>
<p>（恩派亞兼映三輪外片）</p>
<p>（三）三輪戲院（大多中外片兼映）</p>
<p>甲·專映電影者——西海，　西，光華，浙江，明星，九星，辣　，杜美，榮金，亞蒙。</p>
<p>乙·兼演平劇者——其舞台，卡爾登，黃金。</p>
<p>頭輪外片四大戲院，俱觸亞洲影業公司管理之下，票價當然較高，且往往因名片而臨時加價，但設備方面，冬則水汀，夏則冷氣，裝璜陳設，無不精益求精，而管理方面，經理於每塲閒映前必　視於「穿堂　」內，施以相當訓練，務使待客有禮，令人滿意。頭輪國片戲院售價一律自五角起，設備亦尚不惡；二輪外片戲院，雖價格僅自三角三分起，但設備管理，儘量　　頭　外片戲院，故頗合價廉物美之條件；至三輪戲院，售價最低者僅自一角一分起，故設備方面，不得不以火爐代替水汀，電扇代替冷氣，但為競爭營　起見，間亦有較佳設備者，所　招待侍役，亦乏訓練，以致與客人爭吵者，時有所聞。</p>
<h3>「一代尤物」再度遊歐　北平李麗不日放洋</h3>
<p>— 銀筆</p>
<p>先到好萊塢再轉英法</p>
<p>預定行程須歷八個月</p>
<p>名舞女北平李麗，自於間諜嫌疑案在重慶審決無關，脫獄到港以後，曾　聘聯藝公司，演過一部「一代尤物」影片；就為這番疑獄，事經各報競載，轟傳一時的時機關係，「一代尤物」拍照片酬報，竟達港幣三千之鉅。（合國幣五千餘元）距今六七年前，李麗在上海演過「春潮」聲片，工作代價僅三百元，以今例昔，差及十倍；似此龍門身價，又正是她因禍得福的幸事了。</p>
<p>藝畢公司前為籌攝「女子公寓」一片，曾函李麗商請主演。當時為他索價太高，未獲成事。藝華主人嚴幼祥君，此次赴港，擬邀李　年來滬，結果格於條件相差，未及談妥。同時，亦曾訪往李麗，重申前說。據李麗面告：現於短時期內，即須出國去作歐陸之遊，因此對於拍戲的事，目前只能表示抱歉；且俟將來回國以後，決定來給藝華先拍一部片子。</p>
<p>現在，李麗正在忙於準備行裝。此次長征赴歐，她說只是遊歷性質，目的地先到好萊塢去實地觀察，希望能在電影事業方面，多得一些知識，然後歷遊瑞士，英，法，諸國，返國來滬。預計行程日期，至少當在八個月以上。</p>
<p>李麗生性很亢　，天資也極聰明，一口英語說得非常流利。在七年以前，曾和參加世運會諸選手同船赴歐，現今又將遠渡重洋，已是第二次的壯遊！</p>
<p>黃君靜波為江蘇興化人，業餘愛學平劇，研討未及兩載，擅長花衫戲甚多，若武家坡·全本潯陽樓·起解·全本探母·寶連燈·迴龍閣·迴荊州·戰宛城·均經名師指授，每次在各大戲院露演，均傳美　以歸。君　樂於為善，凡有慈善義舉，參加唯恐後人，茲次（即六月廿七日）又徇揚屬同鄉組之聘，在黃金義務戲中客串戰宛城，君節鄒氏，成績非常美滿，右圖即其最近戲製造像也。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>金少山北上後大紅的原因</p>
<p>不過，一般伶人中就是　雲甫的年紀最長，而且後台人聲鼎沸，忙亂異常，同時廚房裹要預備幾萬來寶的飯食。更是不便於隨意要零菜吃的。雲甫究竟是年紀在的人，本已多年不曾出演，素日飲食起居，都有一定時　，况且那天他去的是「龍鳳呈祥」裹的國太，倘是也等到這　大軸子戲完畢之後，再去用飯，那簡直要把老頭兒給餓昏了。正在這時不佞却瞧見金老　忙得滿頭大汗，疾走如飛，一手端着一碗蛋炒飯，一手端着一碗湯，淋淋漓漓的滴得袍子上都是油漬，走到老襲的榻前，獻了上去，說：「老叔，你快用飯罷。要不是我同廚師傅熟，在上海待得久，就連這點吃食也弄不到的。」上面所舉雖是一些小事，可是呌後台所有北平的名角都看出少　這人的確是很念舊的了。決不像某名伶似的，當他爸爸在日，他有時發動　角脾氣，開口就拍着桌子罵道：「你們這些東西，都是吃的老子的飯。」對於生身父母，尚且如此，要是和他死爸爸有交情的人，那簡直連睬也不睬了。所以少　的聲譽越高，架子越低，並且對於金錢方面，更不十分重視。</p>
<p>前　我曾講過郝壽臣的過於重視金錢，在平津無論同行什麼人約他唱戲，非得先拿錢來不行；而且價錢說一不二，半點沒有通融的餘地，小樓慶奎都受到他的氣。有時天雨，上座不佳，自己白累，白貼錢，但是壽臣的戲份一兩百元却已穩當得上腰了。前幾年不佞旅平的時候，就有不少的內行人向我說，壽臣太也不顧同行的義氣啦。他目空一切，自居就是凈行的泰呌啦。（五四）</p>
<h3>王熙春之左儀貞</h3>
<p>— 維特</p>
<p>卡爾登之「天雨花」至最近休息為止，已演至十七十八本，余素主「星期娛樂」，自頭二本開演以來，均往觀賞。周信芳氏之戲，確有百觀不厭之槪，莫怪每屆週末日戲，卡爾登座上輒賣滿堂也。</p>
<p>「天雨花」主角當推信芳之左維明為首，全劇以維明一生鋤奸扶弱忠孝俠義之故事為經，左氏家庭趣事私人遭遇為緯，成此能為一般少奶奶小姐歡迎之鉅構·或謂予觀衆印象最深者非王熙春之左儀貞莫屬誠然後半都「天雨花」內容，已由左維明而傾向左儀貞矣·王熙春自在台上一跳一　拖兩條小　子起，至今出嫁儼然成少婦之態，演來能絲絲入扣，無不畢　，實非容易。觀衆對左儀貞「剛智」而生之愛慕，比比然也。刺鄭國泰有巾幗壓倒髯眉之氣，為國除奸可為後世女子楷模，真奇人也。（稿酬獻金）</p>
<h3>記濱海歌詠團</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>是一個仲夏的黃昏，幾天的雲雨，換來了一個晴天，月光照遍了大地，南陽路濱海中學的操塲上却在舉行一個相當盛大的音樂會。表演是七時半開始的，先由校長王新命作簡短報告，說明音樂的旨趣，接着由幾個女孩子向歌詠團獻花，等到花獻完了，便開始表演。先由中學部的團員，男女約四十人，拼列在舞台上面，在郭瑾先生指揮，高發元先生伴奏之下，開始歌唱。一共有五個節目，便是「會歌」（齊唱），「前進」（二部唱），「中華男兒」（齊唱），「民族之歌」（齊唱），「大衆的歌手」（齊唱）等，都很精彩。接着附小在打擊樂隊伴奏，小指揮籍傳　小姐指揮之下，也是三四十個男女團員，唱三支歌；便是「壯士歌」（二部唱），「進兮」（齊唱），「幹幹幹」（齊唱），都唱得不差。特別是打擊樂隊，拿着鑼鼓等樂器，打擊得非常好聽，不錯一毫節奏。</p>
<p>還有任聽松的女聲獨唱，歌Noctuine一曲；潘淑貞的鋼琴獨奏，譜　Bottle　of　Woteroo　一　；董羽隆的獨唱，歌「望月」一曲，齊巧天上的月兒掛在當空，歌唱時可以望月而歌，格外深情；陳焯光，陳德霖，洋琴松清合奏「漢宮秋月」·無論是獨奏，獨唱，各人都有好處·其他像中學部的「青天白日展開了」，「朝陽」，「西湖」，「航海去」，「國旗」等歌，是二三四部合唱，都唱得不差。而壓軸戲歌劇「送別」和「光明之歌」，更是全部節目的靈魂，非常的精彩。等到散會，已是十點半了。</p>

Your Excellency's brilliant calculations are unique, and you understand both us and the enemy. Your command is decisive, and the strategy is infinitely adaptable. The leadership is effective, and the progress of construction is accelerated many times over. You unite the Party, the government, and the military to plan for the whole, and combine wisdom, benevolence, and courage into one. Your upholding of righteousness is admired both at home and abroad.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Discusses Financial Stability</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Dr. Kong Xiangxi wrote an article for the Associated Press, which briefly stated that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, some people thought that China's finances would collapse early on. Today, that hope has completely turned into an illusion. After two full years of hard fighting, not only has China's economic structure not been shaken, but the facts have also shown that China is more capable of long-term support. Of course, China has encountered not only many but also extremely difficult financial problems. However, there are many reasons why China's finances can sustain a long-term war beyond expectations: (1) In the years before this war, China strengthened its financial and economic structure through various meticulous plans and efforts, so that it could implement various measures to cope with wartime financial difficulties. (2) The progress of political unification of the people and the surge of nationalism have strengthened the government's ability to manage the country's wartime economy. (3) China's national economic life is relatively agricultural, so it is easy to be self-sufficient in many aspects. (4) China's vast and unlimited inland areas are not only rich in manpower but also rich in resources, coupled with the people's hard work and diligence, so that the government's efforts to build the plan can be implemented. (5) Countries' sympathy for China's war of resistance is gradually becoming aware that threatening China's freedom and independence at the same time harms all countries' economic interests and political security. I am deeply convinced that this point will still be of great help to China's financial stability in the future. (6) The reason why China has achieved success in wartime economic management is the maintenance of exchange rates. China, like all countries, has its wartime currency difficulties, so it has to make economic and trade adjustments. Fortunately, China's currency reform in November 1935 has a solid foundation, so the maintenance of the exchange rate of the legal tender has been quite effective. What we should be grateful for here is the assistance of the United States and the United Kingdom to China, such as the United States' purchase of Chinese silver, its export-import bank's 25 million loan to China, and the United Kingdom's credit loan to China, as well as the establishment of a 10 million pound equalization fund in cooperation with the Bank of China, are all reasons for the smooth progress of China's monetary policy. However, foreigners who have commercial interests in the Far East have also benefited a lot. Another characteristic of China's wartime finances, which has a great relationship with foreign interests, is the Chinese government's efforts to maintain its creditworthiness. In recent years, there have been many cases in the world's financial circles of relying on payment of debts, delaying payment of debts, and even completely denying national debts. However, the national government has even assumed the debts that the former Beiping government could not pay. In the year after the outbreak of the war, China always paid the principal and interest of various debts and did not reduce its determination to support its creditworthiness due to the huge military expenditure and the complexity of other wartime expenses. This is the reason why China's credit is unshakable in domestic and foreign markets. This is of course an extremely difficult thing for the Chinese government and people, but China has not announced the deferral of the principal and interest of various debts. In the 21 months after the outbreak of the war, the principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts paid by China amounted to 530,000,000. However, most of the domestic and foreign debts are guaranteed by customs and salt taxes, and the customs and salt taxes have long been seized, so China's determination to maintain credit in this regard is really commendable. Also, from July 1937 to the end of 1938, the Chinese government used income from other sources to pay off debts guaranteed by tariffs, amounting to 175,000,000 yuan. However, in principle, the principal and interest of this bond should be paid from tariff revenues in the occupied areas. The Chinese government was forced to temporarily suspend the payment of Krisper and British and French bonds that were normally due in September last year due to the occupation of salt-producing areas, especially the salt tax revenue in Hebei and Shandong. It was not until January 12 this year that another solution was found. From this time on, the Ministry of Finance no longer continued to allocate funds to the Customs Superintendent, and at the same time ordered it to deposit the tax revenue from uncontested places into the Central Bank for the payment of long-term bonds. As of March 26 this year, the government also took the same measures for salt tax. What is gratifying is that this temporary measure forced by the environment has been greatly sympathized and understood by the financial market. Furthermore, although the Chinese government is facing great difficulties due to the war, it will continue to pay debts. As of March 26 this year, the Chinese government has expressed its intention to discuss with various countries how to maintain the interests of Chinese bondholders, and it is deeply believed that this negotiation will achieve satisfactory results. In addition to the various unpleasant changes at the front, China's foreign friends should pay more attention to the large-scale economic development in the rear of China. China is now making great efforts to develop trade, industry, mining, agriculture, and transportation, in order to create a new economic empire in China's vast rear, the northwest and southwest. This development is now advancing regardless of all difficulties, which is not only of great benefit to China, but also of great benefit to all friendly countries. However, in order to implement this great economic development, the Chinese government hopes that all countries can provide economic and technical assistance. As for China's construction, it should be based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Chinese nation's industrial plan. China welcomes foreign cooperation, not only in seeking wartime financial stability, but also in hoping that foreign countries can help China with economic development during the war.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Today's Foresight and Retrospection</h3>
<p>"If the season had not yet entered summer, today would not be so hot!" "If the two countries of China and Japan had sought to resolve their disputes through normal international diplomatic channels two years ago, even if negotiations had lasted for two years and still could not be resolved satisfactorily, but could have always avoided the use of force, then today would not have come to this point!" These are all the most foolish of regrets. Because time passes day by day and never returns; space is occupied by facts and placed before our eyes; what is "hypothesized" cannot be grasped and made to happen. What is the benefit of just sighing?</p>
<p>The strength of the Japanese is their dedication and foresight; this is recognized regardless of whether one loves, hates, befriends, or opposes the Japanese. Japan's actions towards China are the crystallization of dedication and foresight. But in their history, they have never laid such a long ambush or spent so much money; they initially hoped for a quick victory, but they did not expect that after two years, it would still be vague, only creating the situation of today. Of course, on the Japanese side, they will never admit defeat, especially with many points and lines of military occupation that can be used as counter-evidence; but points are not decisive points, lines are not decisive lines, and occupation is not conquest; from any aspect, starting again from the perspective of a third party and making an objective judgment, one cannot finally recognize that Japan has already succeeded; if a quick victory is used as the standard of measurement, one cannot even say that they have failed considerably. This is the so-called "A wise man sometimes makes a mistake." The Japanese lost in time. On the Chinese side, they were originally passively responding to the war, calling for long-term resistance; undoubtedly, the main purpose was to control time and use it as a spatial battlefield.</p>
<p>Regret is foolish, and all emotional words and actions are foolish! Setting aside emotions and examining reality: everything of today, except for the continued progress in the path of the past two years, we cannot discover any new clues. On the Chinese side, there is absolutely no sign of giving up the war of resistance; no matter whether the Japanese believe that China cannot resist, should not resist, or doubt why China is resisting, the fact that the regular army has fought bravely to this day from Shanxi in the north, through Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, to Guangdong in the south is still there; in addition, the penetration of guerrilla warfare behind Japanese lines is also something that the Japanese have never denied. On the Japanese side, there is absolutely no sign of giving up aggression; no matter what level the Japanese strength is consumed, how difficult it is to make ends meet, and even if it is judged that aggression should only be carried out quickly and cannot last long; or if it is explained that Japan's actions are not aggression and Japan's intention is not aggression; but the Japanese army is already in Chinese territory, at least proving that it is still lingering in the way of aggression in fact, and Japan's propaganda to the country is to encourage war, and its propaganda to the world is to persuade and support Japan's actions, in short, there is no breath of stopping the war.</p>
<p>Based on the reality of the war between China and Japan, it can be explained that the two years of war up to today are only a calculation of time and not a dividing line of the era. The dividing line of the era is unknown when and on what day, whether it is near or far, and there must be signs before the dividing line arrives. There are no signs today. To predict signs, one can first set up hundreds of assumptions of various colors; apart from foolish assumptions and impossible assumptions, we assume three: First, because this war was designed proactively by the Japanese side, if a breath of peace is discovered in Japan, regardless of the source of the breath, in the change of policy or the exhaustion of power, this is an epoch-making sign of the Sino-Japanese War. Second, because China, although it was the initial mover in this war, is the main character; although China is enduring long-term resistance, there must be a general counter-offensive, which is another epoch-making sign of the Sino-Japanese War. The third is international. Internationally, if there is a war of greater scale than the Sino-Japanese War, it will naturally affect the Sino-Japanese war situation: If the international community can maintain peace, then in the past two years, although the international community has made many representations to China and Japan and expressed the hope that China and Japan will cease fighting, to this day, they have absolutely no action to make China and Japan cease fighting urgently. There will be a day in the future when the international community will take some action, which is also an epoch-making sign of the Sino-Japanese War. The three signs have different causes and different effects; observing with a cold eye, one believes that they are possible.</p>
<h3>Japanese "Manchukuo" Troops Invade Outer Mongolian Border, Repelled by Soviet-Mongolian Forces, Japanese "Manchukuo" Troops Had Crossed the Halha River, Soviet-Mongolian Forces Counterattacked and Cleared the West Bank</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The command of the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces in Outer Mongolia recently issued a communiqué stating that on July 2, Japanese "Manchukuo" troops gathered a large number of infantry, cavalry, artillery, and about 100 tanks in the Nomonhan Burd Obo area southeast of Lake Bel, and at dawn on the 3rd, covered by bombers and fighters, they began to cross the border on the entire line from that area and north to Yang Lake, attacking the positions of the Mongolian-Soviet forces on the east bank of the Halha River, attempting to break through to the west bank of the river. The forces participating in the attack included the entire infantry division of the 23rd Division led by the puppet army, as well as an infantry regiment, the 3rd and 4th tank regiments, and about six cavalry regiments. As of now, the offensive of the Japanese-Manchukuo troops in the Nomonhan Burd Obo area has been completely repelled by the Mongolian-Soviet forces, and they have suffered heavy losses. However, in a certain area northwest of that area, Japanese infantry covered by 60 tanks forced the Mongolian-Soviet cavalry to retreat for a certain distance, crossed the west bank of the Halha River, and occupied a small area called Dalmuss. Afterwards, the Mongolian-Soviet land and air forces launched a joint counter-offensive, and as a result, by the evening of July 5, the invading Japanese troops were finally driven back to the east bank of the Halha River, and they suffered heavy losses. At the same time, the air forces of both sides also had large-scale battles, and the Mongolian-Soviet air force won victories. From July 2 to 5, in four days, the Mongolian-Soviet forces lost approximately 100 soldiers killed and 200 wounded, and 25 tanks and armored vehicles. During the same period, the Mongolian-Soviet Air Force lost only 9 aircraft. (6th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to official sources, the Soviet-Mongolian troops launched a counter-offensive yesterday against the Japanese "Manchukuo" troops who invaded Mongolian territory on the 3rd of this month.

<h3>Over Thirty Japanese Planes Conduct Night Raid on Chongqing in Batches, Dropping Multiple Bombs in the Urban Area, Two Fires Quickly Extinguished</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) More than thirty Japanese planes, in four batches, raided Chongqing City at approximately 1:00 AM on the morning of the 6th. As the Japanese planes infiltrated in batches, it was late at night, and they were met with intense fire from Chinese anti-aircraft artillery units. The Japanese planes hurriedly dropped multiple bombs and then fled along their original route. According to a post-incident investigation, although there were two fires, they were quickly extinguished by the fire brigade. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Last midnight and this morning at dawn, Japanese planes in four groups again raided Chongqing. However, as far as is currently known, casualties were minimal. The first and third groups flew over Chongqing without dropping bombs, but the second and fourth groups dropped some bombs over a very large area, apparently without a specific target. Two fires broke out in the urban area but were extinguished by dawn. When the Japanese planes flew over Chongqing, the Chinese air defense force tried new tactics, not using searchlights or firing artillery. Although there was moonlight at night, the clouds were thick and visibility was poor, so the Chinese air defense force did not want to take any action, lest the Japanese planes know their target's location. Therefore, this Japanese air raid caused little damage, only destroying part of a cinema and an apartment building, and a few small shops. In addition, one house was burned down by incendiary bombs. Xiao Tongzi, the president of the Central News Agency, happened to live in the destroyed apartment and was nearly in danger. According to reports, on May 4, the building of the Chongqing Central News Agency was hit by bombs dropped by Japanese planes. Mr. Xiao escaped unharmed from the rubble. This was his second close call. As midnight approached, the alarm sounded loudly. Mr. Xiao was talking with several friends when they heard the alarm. His friends went into the bomb shelter, but Mr. Xiao stayed alone in the room. With a loud crash, the apartment was hit, less than 30 feet from his residence. However, Mr. Xiao escaped unharmed. Afterwards, a Reuters reporter visited him and saw him watching the rescue team dig through the rubble to rescue men and women who were trapped underneath and still calling for help. The two groups of Japanese planes dropped fewer than thirty bombs, of which one-third were incendiary bombs. The first group of Japanese planes appeared at midnight, and the fourth group left at about 2:00 AM. The all-clear was sounded at 2:30 AM. The local emergency and fire brigades are very well organized. When the Reuters reporter visited the bombed area after the Japanese planes left, he saw that everything had been arranged in an orderly manner. The emergency team was providing medical care to the injured, the stretcher team was carrying away the dead, and the electricity and telephone companies had sent workers to rush repairs to the damaged power lines. (Reuters, 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Last night, twenty-seven Japanese planes attacked Chongqing. It was the first time that Japanese planes had raided this city on a clear moonlit night. Before twelve o'clock last night, the air raid alarm sounded loudly. A quarter of an hour later, the first group of Japanese planes, numbering twelve, appeared in the sky and dropped bombs in the Xiaguan area. The city was not attacked. Soon afterwards, a second group of Japanese planes, also numbering twelve, invaded the city and dropped several heavy bombs before fleeing. Around two o'clock this morning, a third group of Japanese planes appeared, a small number, only three, and dropped some incendiary bombs, which started two major fires. (Haitong News Agency, 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the air raid on Chongqing last night, according to unofficial sources, the Canadian church hospital in the center of Chongqing City was directly hit by two bombs. The extent of the damage is unknown. It is widely believed that the staff of the hospital had already moved elsewhere. Several heavy bombs also fell near the former German Consulate, so the consulate suffered more damage. Fortunately, the consulate staff and important documents had been evacuated after the air raid on June 11, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable. Two fires broke out in Chongqing City last night. The extent of the damage has not been officially disclosed. (Haitong News Agency, 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, thirty Japanese planes came here to carry out a night bombing, dropping incendiary and explosive bombs in the inner city, destroying many houses and starting three major fires. As for the number of civilian casualties, because there was advance warning, the people had time to take shelter, and at the same time, most of the city's population had already been evacuated, so it is believed that the number will not be large. The Women's Hospital run by the Foreign Missions Board and the German Consulate were slightly damaged. The former had its kitchen destroyed, while the latter suffered very minor damage. The Japanese planes came in two batches, the first appearing at 0:40 AM and the second appearing an hour later. When the Japanese planes came, the fog was very low, so although the searchlights searched the sky incessantly, they could hardly find any trace of the Japanese planes, so the anti-aircraft guns could not fire. The all-clear was sounded at 3:30 AM. It is also heard that the damage suffered by the Foreign Missions Board amounted to more than $5,000 US. (Associated Press, 6th dispatch)</p>

<p>The Turkish government recently completed a census in the capital city and has now published the results. The total population of the country is 17,829,000, an increase of 4,181,000 compared to 1927. In terms of percentage, the country's population has increased by just over 33 percent. In the past, Turkey was often referred to as the "Sick Man of the Near East," but now its population has increased dramatically. There are two main reasons for this: firstly, the country has made significant progress in all areas, and secondly, in recent years, people living abroad have been returning to their homeland one after another.

<h3>US Imposes Additional Taxes on Italian Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department decided today to impose additional taxes on all silk fabrics imported from Italy. According to officials of the department, whenever a country implements an export subsidy system, the US government can, in accordance with the provisions of the 1930 Tariff Act, impose import taxes on the subsidized exports as compensation. The export of Italian silk fabrics is currently subsidized by the Italian government, so this method is being used to deal with it. The rate of the additional tax will vary depending on the type of silk fabric, but it must be equal to the amount of the subsidy. (Havas News Agency, 5th dispatch)</p>

<h3>After Half a Month of Fierce Fighting in Yixing, Japanese Troops Have Completely Collapsed and Sustained Casualties of More Than One Thousand Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>Suzhou correspondence, in the middle of last month, the Chinese troops crossing the river arrived at Yixing, and made all military arrangements, and closely contacted the mobile troops stationed there. Then they carried out a general counter-offensive against Yixing City. At that time, the Japanese troops in Yixing were very few in number, so without being severely attacked by the Chinese army, they retreated and asked the Japanese army stationed in Suzhou for assistance. The Japanese army stationed in Suzhou immediately gathered more than 1,000 Japanese troops from Kunshan, Changshu, Qingpu, and other counties, as well as more than 2,000 puppet troops from various places, and forcibly conscripted more than 5,000 civilian laborers, and rushed to Yixing. At that time, the Chinese army was already waiting in strict array. After the Japanese troops arrived successively, they launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army. The Chinese army calmly resisted and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army. After several days, the Japanese army changed its battle plan and moved all the Japanese troops back, forcing the civilian laborers to charge with wooden sticks. At that time, in order to avoid sacrificing their compatriots, the Chinese army retreated to both sides. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army mistakenly believed that the front line had won a victory, and also advanced forward. Seeing the Japanese army advancing, the Chinese army flashed out from both sides and fired machine guns at the Japanese army. At that time, the Japanese army's line was in great chaos and fled in all directions. At the same time, the Chinese army adopted an encirclement strategy and cut off the Japanese army into several groups. By the 1st of this month, the Japanese army had completely collapsed and returned to Suzhou in a panic. A total of half a month of fierce fighting resulted in the Japanese side, in addition to the deputy commander Hongo Keito being seriously injured, more than 1,000 officers and soldiers being killed in battle, and more than 700 puppet troops and conscripted civilian laborers being killed or wounded. It is heard that the Chinese army also had considerable casualties, but the captured spoils of war were enough to compensate for the losses.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops in Huaian Levy Extortionate Taxes and Forcibly Draft Soldiers in the City</h3>
<p>Huaian correspondence. Since the Japanese troops in Huaian were heavily besieged by the Chinese army, their path to survival has been in a desperate situation. Daily necessities and the economy are in difficulty. The funds of the puppet maintenance association are even more desperate. Big and small traitors thought of the impossible and discussed ways to levy extortionate taxes. The general idea is that the city's electricity, originally limited to Japanese military use, and all merchants and residents were not allowed to use electricity. Now, in order to solve the economic difficulties, the Japanese puppets forced all residential and commercial houses in the city to install electricity meters. All those who consumed five units of electricity per month in the past must now pay electricity bills calculated at ten units per month. Those who previously consumed twenty or thirty units per month must double their consumption and pay in advance. If the public does not comply, they will all be arrested and detained in the puppet police department, and charged with the crime of destroying orders and executed. The people in the city could not bear the trampling and secretly contacted to launch a counter-offensive.</p>
<p>The traitors of the puppet organization in Huaian, now the investigation reveals that the chairman of the puppet maintenance association and commander of the puppet police, Sha Guizhang, the puppet security director and captain of the puppet youth corps, Liu Baoshan, the director of the puppet transfer office, Wang Zihou, the chairman of the puppet women's association, Huang Quanshi, the principal of the puppet Huaian elementary school, Hashimoto (Japanese), the chief of the puppet Huaian urban district, Song Kun, the Japanese army headquarters is located in the Qian residence in Falun Temple Lane, the Longniao Wu residence in Dongchang Street, the Shen Gongguan, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers are stationed at each of the four city gates, and each has a light machine gun. The Japanese army's warehouse is located in the Bank of China. Also, at 12:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Japanese army in Huaian used five civilian ships to transport 60 members of the puppet youth corps and 30 members of the puppet women's corps newly coerced from Huaian City, and 20 Japanese soldiers to Huaiyin for training. In addition, the Japanese army in Huaian City continued to coerce 30 soldiers to form the puppet second youth corps.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Wuxing Invade Wukang and are Defeated, The Whole County Forms Local Rifle Corps</h3>
<p>Wukang correspondence. After the Chinese army recovered Wukang, they immediately conscripted the people and organized local rifle corps. Those that have been established are Hongni, Jiudu, Tangpu, Yinghong, Saile, Moganshan, Yong'an, Longshan and other places, and are undergoing strict training. On the 1st of this month, more than 500 Japanese troops from Wuxing, taking advantage of the continuous rain, led by traitors, passed through Miaoxi to the Ganshan Ku area, and another group bypassed Daqingshan from a side road, attempting to invade Wukang City. The division of the Chinese army stationed in Wukang and a part of the Chinese army stationed in Sanqiaobu surrounded and severely attacked the two groups of Japanese troops. The Japanese troops fled in droves to Nantang. On the way, they were captured and killed by the people. After the Japanese troops retreated to Wuxing, they set up electric nets at each city gate and dared not invade again. At the same time, the Chinese army pursued to the north of Miaoxi and completely recovered Phoenix Mountain and Guapishan, all strategic locations.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt and Hull Discuss New Neutrality Act, Senate Postpones Discussion Until Saturday, Government Believes Victory Will Ultimately Be Achieved</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, after returning to Washington from Hyde Park yesterday, President Roosevelt discussed peace and neutrality issues with Secretary of State Hull during lunch. The President also conferred with Democratic congressional leaders Senator Barkley and Representative Rayburn on the best way to pass the Neutrality Act early and to restore normal monetary powers. The Senate's postponement of the discussion of the new Neutrality Act until Saturday reveals the pressure from isolationist senators, who are now cautiously exploring public opinion and observing letters to determine to what extent they can oppose the President. According to Senator Pittman's office, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to submit a report to the Senate within a week, but it is not yet known whether it will differ from the Bloom Bill or contain new recommendations. An American magazine published an article by Hoover containing statements such as the United States should not attempt to prevent the inevitable readjustments of various nations, which was denounced today by a senior official as a particularly irresponsible and harmful opinion. Isolationist Senator Fish declared that the House of Representatives will never abandon its determination to strictly adhere to neutrality and will not allow the President to interfere in European affairs. The government side, on the other hand, stated that after reviewing the opinions of the Senate, it believes that the President's Neutrality Act opinions, even if they require weeks of debate, will eventually become law. (Reuters, 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided today to postpone discussion of the Bloom Neutrality Act passed by the House until Saturday, because several members also serve on the Finance Committee, which is currently busy dealing with other matters, leaving these members without time to attend the Foreign Relations Committee. The government's move to amend the Neutrality Act was thus delayed again. Chairman Pittman of the Foreign Relations Committee stated that he was not troubled by the delay. Pittman also firmly stated that the government side intends to make a final effort to request the cancellation of the arms export ban. (Reuters, 5th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since President Roosevelt issued a declaration on the Neutrality Act, German newspapers have suddenly recognized him as the foremost warmonger, having once again taken the place of British Prime Minister Chamberlain. A semi-official newspaper in Berlin believes that the United States' neutrality is not worth mentioning, but the American President and his Jewish accomplices have used it to incite a war against Germany. We wish to make it clear to the American people that the American President's desire to drive them into the encirclement not only fails to reduce the danger of a world war, but is sufficient to increase it.

<p>(New York) Hoover, the last surviving retired president of the United States, today urgently called on the US government to strictly adhere to neutrality in the future European war. An American magazine published today contains an article by Hoover, which considers that the policy of rivalry among European powers does not require involvement. "After the United States intervenes in European problems, the people of both Europe and the Americas will not benefit from it." Former President Hoover also said, "Roosevelt has occupied an important position in the European crisis, therefore, American citizens have encountered a crisis of international balance of power," and finally said, "European countries will repeat the great war."

<h3>Extension of President's Power on US Currency Law, Senate Passes Compromise Plan, Domestic Silver Purchase Price Revised to 71.1 Cents Per Ounce</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the extension of the time limit for President Roosevelt's monetary and financial powers, the compromise plan drafted by the joint committee of the two houses of Congress was approved by the Senate today by a vote of 43 to 39, and the domestic silver purchase price was revised to 71.1 cents per ounce. However, the purchase of foreign silver is not affected due to the continued validity of the Silver Act. According to reports, the President's powers were due to expire on June 30 of this year. Prior to this, the government had proposed a bill requesting an extension of the time limit for two years. The House of Representatives approved it on April 20. However, the Senate amended and passed it on June 26. Thereupon, the two houses organized a joint committee, which passed a compromise plan on June 29, advocating (1) President Roosevelt should continue to enjoy the power to change the gold content of the US dollar and purchase foreign silver, (2) the Exchange Stabilization Fund should continue to exist (the total amount of the fund is 2 billion US dollars), (3) the domestic silver purchase price is 70 cents per ounce. After the compromise plan was approved by the House of Representatives on June 30, it was transferred to the Senate for discussion on the same day. However, the opposition senators in the Senate deliberately delayed it and made lengthy speeches one after another, so that the bill could not be put to a vote before midnight on the same day (that is, when the President's powers expired). When the Senate convened today, the bill was brought up for discussion again, and the government sent leader Barkley to make a speech, saying that at this time when the international situation is tense and the clouds of war are spreading, the President's monetary and financial powers should indeed be extended. Last year, thanks to the President's power to depreciate the value of the US dollar, the pound was able to avoid devaluation. The importance of this power can be seen from this. As for continuing to purchase foreign silver, I have not felt concerned in principle at first. However, if the purchase of foreign silver is stopped abruptly while the issue of the confiscation of Mexican oil mines has not been resolved, it will be regarded as unfriendly to the outside world, and I feel that it is not advisable. I also firmly believe that if the oil mine issue can be resolved satisfactorily, its importance to our country will be far greater than stopping the purchase of foreign silver. If a country's currency stability is of great importance to our national defense, and we are currently negotiating with it, then suddenly stopping the purchase of its silver is not only unwise, but also impolite. Therefore, we should not take this action at this time. The Senate then put the compromise plan to a vote. Except for revising the domestic silver price, all other points were passed according to the original plan. (Havas News Agency, 5th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed the compromise currency law, stipulating that President Roosevelt will continue to have the power to depreciate the value of the US dollar. The House of Representatives had previously passed the bill with 229 votes against 160, and the bill has now been sent to the White House for signature. According to this bill, the domestic silver price will be 71.1 cents, and the price of foreign silver will be announced this afternoon. Well-informed sources believe that it will be around 30 cents. Before the Senate voted to approve the bill, the US Treasury Department suddenly decided not to announce any silver prices or make any comments on the monetary situation. Therefore, the Treasury Department has not announced the purchase prices of domestic and foreign silver. At the same time, the Mint has temporarily refused to purchase domestic silver produced after June 30, 1939. The Mint's action is based on the powers stipulated in the Silver Purchase Act. Hanthaman &amp; Company did not post the New York bar silver price today. (Reuters, 5th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Three-Nation Mutual Assistance Agreement - Provisions Temporarily Difficult to Draft - Protection System Still Awaiting Comprehensive Planning</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the matter of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union concluding a mutual assistance agreement, responsible individuals here recently declared that there is no surprise that this agreement has been delayed until now. Generally, several more weeks of consultation will be needed before the provisions can be drafted. The difficulty lies not in the basic issues, but in the procedures. For example, the basic concept of resisting aggression to maintain peace is shared by all relevant countries. The British and French authorities also understand which side the Soviet Union will assist if war breaks out in Europe in the future. However, this matter is exceptionally complex, and its original plan has expanded in scope, both politically and strategically, extending the mechanical mutual guarantee system to the whole of Europe. A comprehensive plan is needed to be effective. However, to warn Germany again and make it aware of the need for restraint, the countries concerned must quickly establish an agreement and formulate provisions based on the basic points already agreed upon, while leaving the procedural difficulties for later deliberation.

<p>Lithuania and the Guarantee Issue</p>
<p>Warsaw: Lithuanian Minister to the Soviet Union, Nakovicius, who was originally on vacation in his home country, suddenly returned to his post in Moscow. The "Warsaw Daily" commented on this, saying, "The Lithuanian Minister's sudden return is because the Soviet government is also requesting that Britain and France extend assistance and guarantees to Lithuania. Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov, in view of Germany's activities in the Baltic Sea, insists that it is also necessary to extend assistance and guarantees to Lithuania. This desire of the Soviet government to draw Lithuania into its sphere of interest has aroused suspicion among the people of Warsaw, because Polish people consider Lithuania to be Poland's 'special sphere of interest'." (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Belgium Unwilling to Accept Guarantees</p>
<p>(Brussels) The Anglo-French-Soviet mutual agreement under negotiation, which plans to extend guarantees to neutral countries, has aroused great attention here after the Dutch government protested to Britain. Belgium has also been mentioned as one of the countries guaranteed by the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement. The "Belgica Newspaper" commented, "Belgium's unwillingness to accept guarantees is for the same reason as the Netherlands. Now Prime Minister Pierlot should follow in the footsteps of the Netherlands and protest at this appropriate time. Belgium resolutely opposes Soviet interference in Belgian affairs, lest the result be that Belgium is drawn into the collective security system of the three-nation agreement." The "Siecle Newspaper" demanded that the government issue a declaration clearly stating that Belgium, in addition to the guarantees already provided by Britain, France, and Germany, is unwilling to accept any further guarantees.

<p>French Foreign Minister Receives Turkish Ambassador</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet received the Turkish Ambassador to France, Davas, yesterday afternoon for talks. According to well-informed sources, the main topic of discussion was the recent progress of the Anglo-French-Soviet treaty negotiations. It is understood that the Turkish government is extremely concerned about the progress of the negotiations, and the Turkish government has previously stated that if the current Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations do not result in a concluded agreement, then Turkey is unwilling to sign a mutual assistance agreement with France.

<p>Similarities and Differences in Anglo-Soviet Opinions</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the scope of guarantees proposed by the Anglo-French-Soviet countries, the proposal not to include the Netherlands and Switzerland was accepted, but the Soviet interpretation of "internal aggression" in the Baltic states was not endorsed. According to the Soviet position, if a foreign country exerts pressure on the Baltic states to change their laws, this should also be regarded as a threat to the Baltic states, and Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should immediately take military action to stop this "internal aggression." The British Cabinet, after discussion, believes that this interpretation is too broad. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the compromise proposal on the Moscow negotiations submitted by the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, to the British Foreign Office yesterday, British officials and the French Embassy are maintaining silence. Political figures point out that the difficulties in the three-nation negotiations may not have been resolved in the two-hour meeting of the British Cabinet yesterday. Therefore, Prime Minister Chamberlain's report in the House of Commons stated that "the difficulties are not entirely on one side." According to news from Paris, political figures in the French capital do not seem as optimistic about the three-nation negotiations as they were a few days ago. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources here, after a lengthy telephone conversation between French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, and Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday afternoon, Corbin visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax in the evening to discuss several issues. It is reported that the Danzig issue was also among the topics discussed. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Finnish Foreign Minister Reaffirms Attitude</p>
<p>Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko declared to a reporter from the London Evening News that if another country attempts to guarantee Finland's independence without Finland's consent, the Finnish government will consider it an improper action and will mobilize the nation's forces for self-defense. Finnish newspapers state that it is entirely Britain's business to choose which countries to ally with, and Finland has nothing to do with it, but Finland legally and morally requires that Britain not use Finland's independence as an exchange condition when concluding treaties with other countries. For example, if Britain accepts the Soviet Union's demands, Finland's right to self-determination will be violated. The Dutch government has clearly expressed its attitude to other governments.

<h3>Danzig in a State of Armed Truce - Polish Engineers Building Fortifications on the Border</h3>
<p>Danzig: The situation in Danzig has temporarily improved, but it can only be described as an "armed truce." In reality, both sides claim that they are strong and can wait for an opportunity. This stalemate shows no signs of moving towards a resolution. Danzig Nazi leader Forster will deliver a speech today, but its tone is unlikely to be more constructive than his previous speeches. Several large detachments of French new engineers have recently arrived in the vicinity of Grodek on the Danzig border to build fortifications. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) General Goering's mouthpiece, the "Essen National Daily," published an article yesterday attributing the panic caused by the news that a shocking incident would occur in Danzig last week to the British Foreign Office. The article stated, "The British Foreign Office hosted diplomatic reporters from London newspapers in early July, telling them that the Nazi Party would take action in Danzig. As a result, the newspapers widely spread this story. Whether this British conspiracy was instructed by Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, or diplomatic advisor Sir Vansittart, we need to pay special attention to it." (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris: Polish Ambassador to France, Łukasiewicz, had important talks with Foreign Minister Bonnet this afternoon.

<h3>French New Invention - Air Defense Design - Uses Artificial Dense Clouds to Cover Ground Targets</h3>
<p>(Paris) French technician Dubois has recently invented a novel air defense design, proposing to use artificial dense clouds to cover the ground, causing enemy aircraft to lose their targets. Although the scale of construction required is huge and requires enormous funding, the French military authorities are carefully considering it. According to Dubois himself, he can create a dense cloud about one kilometer thick in a few hours, allowing any city to avoid aircraft bombing, and after several studies and experiments, he is convinced that it will be successful. According to Dubois's plan, it is based on his usual research on tornadoes. It is said that tornadoes can draw all the large amounts of moisture on the ground into the air in a few minutes. It is only necessary to build several inverted conical towers on the ground, equipped with household-type propellers at the bottom, to generate a tornado, sending air to the upper part at a speed of forty meters per second, so that it mixes with a part of the air saturated with water, and then allowing it to rise into the colder high air, so that it condenses into dense clouds, so as to obscure all the scenery on the ground. As for the inverted conical towers, their size can be determined as needed, generally the largest can be extended to one hundred meters in diameter at the top, and the smallest can be reduced to fifty-five meters, and there is no fixed height. If Paris is taken as an example, it is only necessary to build a huge tower about two hundred and fifty or three hundred meters high, and the dense clouds it can create are enough to cover the entire city, or five or six towers about one hundred and fifty-five feet high can be built separately in the suburbs."

<h3>British Miners' Federation Calls for End to War - Letter to German Miners - Resist Aggression Policy</h3>
<p>(London) The Miners' Federation held a meeting in Swansea today and passed a letter to German miners, which will be broadcast to that country on a secret radio station. Its content briefly stated that British and German miners had fought together for many years in the past, and should not allow capitalists to exploit them arbitrarily. At this moment, the crux of the international confrontation must be known to you and will never be deceived. You must also be well aware that the scourge of war is extremely cruel and should be avoided. I hereby appeal to you to resist all aggressive policies. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Discussion of Tianjin Case - Unwilling to Expand Scope - Anti-British Sentiment Rises in Japan - British Newspapers Acknowledge Negotiations Will Be Difficult</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) On the eve of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, the Japanese Army's organ newspaper, "Hochi Shimbun," launched an anti-British movement last night, and anti-British sentiment spread throughout Japan. Nagai Ryutaro, a leader of the Minseito party, former Minister of Communications, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, was a prominent speaker in last night's anti-British movement. He announced that Wang Jingwei, a former Kuomintang leader who fled from Chongqing several months ago, had proposed to Japan several years ago to unite China and Japan to resist British and other third-country forces in the Far East. Nagai declared that Britain must realize that the wave of independence and national self-determination is sweeping across Asia. The current situation in the Far East is "no different from the wave of independence sweeping across the United States during the American Revolution." When Nagai spoke to 2,500 listeners, anti-British flags were hung all over the stage, such as "Crush the hypocrisy of cunning British diplomacy," "Abolish the cancer of the Far East - foreign concessions," "Overthrow those who worship Britain, because they are public enemies of the nation," "Do not let thousands of loyal people die in vain," "Conclude a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and closely monitor the Anglo-Japanese negotiations," etc. Nagai claimed that Wang Jingwei advocated that China and Japan conclude an alliance to resist Britain, "because Japan and China are countries of the same race and culture."

<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese military blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, representatives of the British and Japanese governments are about to conduct negotiations in Tokyo. All newspapers here have commented on this. The Times stated, "The British government has decided to limit the discussion to local incidents. Raising other issues would affect the interests of other countries, which Britain is unwilling to interfere with." The Daily Mail expressed pessimism, stating, "Japanese soldiers and radical elements have repeatedly made radical statements, declaring that these negotiations will be difficult to achieve anything unless they are based on Britain completely changing its policy towards China, which is difficult for Britain to accept. Therefore, these negotiations may not be successful." (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The newspapers in North China controlled by the Japanese continue to slander Britain in various ways. One newspaper stated today that the British authorities secretly incited Chinese bandits to disrupt the rear of the Japanese army under British command, and supplied them with weapons. However, it did not explain how this could be done since the British concession in Tianjin had already been blockaded. The Japanese movement is largely directed against the British Consul-General in Tianjin, Jamieson. A statement issued by British missionaries in Shanxi Province has fully clarified that the anti-British movement in that area is directed by the Japanese. It is reported that several missionaries have been directly intimidated. Anti-British posters have been pasted on churches and schools in Shanxi Province, one of which advocates "restoring the methods of 1900." (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources here, the representatives of Japan attending the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo have been determined as follows: (1) Foreign Minister Arita, (2) Counselor Kato of the Embassy in "Manchukuo," (3) Consul Tanaka of Tianjin, (4) Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka. As for the British representatives, in addition to British Ambassador Craigie as the chief representative, the others are Consul Herbert and many members of the British Embassy in Japan. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun received a dispatch from Tianjin today severely criticizing the British authorities. The various points mentioned are: (1) More than 30 officials from the British Concession's Municipal Council and British garrison officers have accepted positions as advisors to the Chinese government and receive salaries from the Chinese government, upon the recommendation of British Ambassador to China, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen. (2) British missionaries are in contact with the Kuomintang and the Chinese government, providing intelligence and funds to guerrillas in North China. (3) British warships carry weapons and supplies to the Communist Party and guerrillas in the Gulf of Zhili. (4) Leaders of anti-Japanese elements mostly live in the British concession and are protected by the concession police. (5) Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and personnel from the Kailan Mining Administration use broadcasts to disseminate anti-Japanese news for the Chinese government. (6) The British concession authorities prohibit the circulation of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes and strongly support legal tender. (7) The printing machines for the banknotes issued by the Communist armies in various regions of North China were transported by the British army. (8) When the British concession authorities conduct searches jointly with the Japanese military police, they allow well-known anti-Japanese elements to hide in both locations. (9) British warships carry large quantities of weapons and ammunition to points near Haizhou, supplying guerrillas in Shandong and Hebei provinces, and are still carrying them. (10) British merchants in various parts of North China spy on the movements of the Japanese army. (11) Personnel from the British consulate, British personnel from the Railway Administration, and British journalists are currently guiding anti-Japanese movements to officials of Chinese agencies.

<p>(London) Several questions were raised in the House of Commons today regarding the situation in Tianjin. One member asked Under-Secretary Butler to guarantee that the four suspects in the Tianjin incident would not be extradited until sufficient evidence was presented. Butler replied that he could not add anything to his reply of July 3, when Butler stated that the government had no intention of extraditing the four suspects during the Tokyo negotiations, when answering questions from Labour Deputy Leader Greenwood. Labour MP Noel-Baker spoke in succession, asking the government to note that if it refused to make this guarantee, it might have an adverse impact on China, India, and other parts of the East. Butler replied that the issue of extraditing the suspects would be one of the events discussed in the Tokyo negotiations and recalled that there was no issue of extraditing the four suspects while negotiations were in progress. Labour MP Benn also asked whether the statement made by the French Minister of Justice last night regarding this unexpected incident was authorized by the government. Butler replied that he had not seen it. Liberal MP said that the events being discussed in Tokyo would be limited to local disputes. Butler then repeated Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement that local disputes would be discussed as a response. Mander also asked about the incident on July 2 when British resident Anderson was strip-searched in Tianjin. Butler replied that he had given a detailed account of this matter on the 3rd. Since June 27, no other incidents have occurred at the various search locations in the Tianjin concession, except for the above-mentioned incident. Since July 1, only a very small amount of milk for hospital use has been transported into the British concession. The British Consul-General has raised this matter with the Japanese side, and the general situation is no different from what the Prime Minister stated on June 6. It is reported that the speech by the French Minister of Justice mentioned in Benn's question refers to a speech made by Lord Maugham to legal professionals at the Lord Mayor of London's banquet. At that time, the French Minister raised a toast to the King of England and discussed the equality of justice in the territory ruled by Britain, and said that the most obvious example was that if a government of a powerful country thousands of miles away requested local British officials to extradite foreign criminals, we should consider this kind of request to be illegal and would not be extradited until all the necessary legal procedures were met. British personnel stationed abroad are currently handling it in this way, because this method is normal. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) At the meeting of the House of Commons today, one member asked Under-Secretary Butler to publish details of the seizure of customs duties in Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, or the remittance of loans to North China. Butler replied that the Japanese authorities are currently depositing these taxes in the Yokohama Specie Bank in the name of the Chief Inspector of Customs. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Russian-language anti-Communist report "Asia Reborn" was not allowed to be published in the British concession today.

<p>(Tianjin) Mr. Griffiths, the third mate of the Taikoo Dockyard's Yuezhou steamer, was detained last Thursday because he was said by the Japanese side to have made "improper remarks" to Japanese soldiers, and has not yet been released.

<h3>German and Dutch Economic Ministers Exchange Views</h3>
<p>The Hague: The Dutch government hosted a banquet last night to entertain German Economic Minister Funk. Dutch Economic Minister Steenberg and Funk exchanged views at the table, pointing out the importance of further expanding economic relations between Germany and the Netherlands. Funk expressed his belief: "This kind of opinion will definitely create good results. Trade between Germany and the Netherlands is very important. Now we should improve the payment system. Past efforts by Germany and the Netherlands to promote commercial relations prove that although the monetary systems of Germany and the Netherlands are different, close cooperation to achieve good results is also possible."

<h3>British Government Orders National Food Storage</h3>

<h3>Prime Minister of Bulgaria Arrives in Berlin for Talks with Hitler; Content of Discussions Kept Strictly Secret</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Georgi Kyoseivanov, arrived here yesterday and was greeted with enthusiastic welcome. Mr. Kyoseivanov is accompanied by a large number of officials for a three-day visit to Germany, during which he will meet with Hitler, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and Aviation Minister Göring. It is generally believed that the Prime Minister of Bulgaria's mission is easy to accomplish in the political sphere, as Germany considers Bulgaria its safest friend and is very likely to make it its ally. Therefore, agreement on general policies can be assured. Bulgaria naturally desires German support in its demand for Romania to cede Dobruja, but it appears that this issue will not be raised in an urgent manner. It is expected that the two sides will engage in extensive economic talks, as Germany is Bulgaria's largest customer. (Reuters, June 6)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After arriving in Berlin yesterday afternoon, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Bulgaria, Georgi Kyoseivanov, rested briefly before proceeding to the Führer's office to meet with the German Führer, Hitler, for an hour and twenty minutes of talks. The content of the talks is being kept strictly secret by officials, and no official announcement will be made before Mr. Kyoseivanov leaves Germany on the 7th. However, the fact that the Bulgarian Minister to Germany, Mr. Dreganov, the Director of Political Affairs of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Atilov, and the German Minister to Bulgaria were present during the talks between the two Prime Ministers yesterday afternoon suggests that the discussions must have involved detailed issues. Before visiting Mr. Hitler yesterday afternoon, the Bulgarian Prime Minister first visited the German Foreign Ministry to meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who in turn paid a return visit to the Bellevue Palace.

<h3>German Ministry of Defense Director Visits England for Inspection; Tour of Military Installations Causes Surprise</h3>
<p>(London) Colonel Steedlin, the Director of British Affairs at the German Ministry of Defense, is currently in England on a private visit to inspect public opinion and military preparations, with particular attention to British defense capabilities. He is a man of considerable influence in Germany, has close ties with various leaders of the Nazi Party, and possesses extensive military and technical knowledge. Therefore, his findings are bound to have a significant impact. Mr. McNamara, a Conservative Member of Parliament and an old friend of his, is leading the tour and has obtained permission from the British War Office to visit military camps and several military installations. He has also encountered many key figures in British military and political circles, and will be able to form a judgment on the current state of British defense. This matter has recently been the subject of much discussion among British political figures. Some say that it is strange that the British government should allow a German military officer to visit military installations at a time of international tension. Others say that when German air force representatives recently toured England, the British authorities showed them various old-fashioned aircraft, and Germany may not have been deeply impressed by British air power. This was not the British side's initial intention. By analogy, it is best to let Colonel Steedlin understand the true state of British military strength. (Havas, June 6)</p>

<h3>Truth Revealed About France's Rebuilding of its Air Force</h3>
<p>(Paris) The secret of France's efforts to rebuild its air force was revealed yesterday by General Vuillemin, Chief of Staff of the French Air Force. In a speech to the Aviation Society, General Vuillemin declared that France is rebuilding its air force at a rate of 18,000 aircraft per year. In addition to purchasing several hundred aircraft from abroad, France can manufacture two aircraft per hour. He also stated that after the new air force is established, France's air power in North Africa and the Mediterranean region will be increased. The new French air force will make its debut on July 14, Democracy Day, when 1,500 of the latest bombers are scheduled to soar through the skies of Paris and participate in the annual military parade.

<h3>Robben Island in South Africa to Build Fortress, to Become Second Singapore</h3>
<p>Cape Town: Robben Island, facing Cape Town (near the Cape of Good Hope), known as a "desert island", will now become Africa's "Singapore". New gun emplacements will be added throughout the island as the most important point of coastal defense. The Minister of Defense, Mr. Pirow, and other military personnel recently inspected the island's defenses. It is said that the island is now fortified, and all ships, fishermen, and tourists are prohibited from landing. Robben Island was formerly a prison camp, and later became a residence for the insane and lepers, including 500 government personnel, 100 prisoners, 500 insane people, and 1,000 lepers. But it has now become an important defense point for South Africa. (Associated Press, June 6)</p>

<h3>The North-China Daily News Comments on Anglo-Soviet Negotiations; Prospects for Negotiations Have Improved Compared to the Past; Success is Expected Before the European Situation Deteriorates</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News published an editorial yesterday entitled "Some Progress Has Been Made," which discusses the reasons for the slow progress of the Anglo-French-Soviet anti-aggression pact, explaining the situation in great detail and dispelling the confusion of the general public. The following is a translation: "Both London and Soviet circles believe that an Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance pact is in sight, while British circles in Moscow are not so optimistic. In the absence of reliable news, it is only speculation for outsiders to judge the merits of the two sides' views. However, the recent progress in these negotiations is clearly better than before, so there seems to be a good chance of success before the European situation deteriorates further. One of the difficulties that have accompanied the negotiations is that they had to begin under unfortunate circumstances. Since 1937, the Soviet Union seems to have had more misunderstandings about all British actions than doubts about British loyalty. First, in July of that year, the Non-Intervention Committee did not accept the Soviet Union's views. The Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, accused the United Kingdom of selling out the Spanish government. This was clearly due to the United Kingdom's failure to assist Spain and its advocacy of maintaining complete neutrality. Then, after Austria was annexed by Germany, Mr. Maisky sent a note to the British government proposing a conference of the great powers to consider joint action to resist aggressor countries. Chamberlain rejected this proposal, replying that the indirect and inevitable consequence of such a move would be to undermine the prospects for peace in Europe. A few months later, the Sudetenland eventually belonged to Germany, and Czechoslovakia was divided. Although the Soviet Union claimed that it was willing to send troops to resist Germany if invited, the United Kingdom still claimed that it was too early to hold a conference to plan the containment of aggression, and again rejected the proposal. These several rejections, if the Munich Agreement had any sincerity, would have seemed reasonable. Later, the situation worsened, and everyone recognized that the offer made by the Soviet Union at that time was indeed the best way to deal with any threat of aggression planned by the dictator countries, but it was too late. The Soviet Union was first excluded from the Munich Conference and then repeatedly offered proposals that were rejected. This could not but bring the relations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to the highest harmony.</p>
<p>The negotiations have been delayed again and again. If the truth can be fully disclosed, British diplomats have probably had two obstacles to overcome. One is the doubts arising from the above-mentioned rejection of the proposal, and the other is that the Soviet Union has always been known as difficult to deal with. Or there may be a third obstacle, which is that the Soviet Union seems to feel that the other side is trying to relegate the Soviet Union to the status of a secondary country, and is resentful of this. The Soviet government has stated from the beginning that it can only engage in negotiations on the basis of complete equality. As soon as this obstacle was removed, the Soviet Union demanded that the guarantees discussed should be extended to the Baltic states, regardless of whether they were willing to accept the guarantees or not. Although this has not been officially recognized, it appears that both the United Kingdom and France are prepared to accept this demand, but ask the Soviet Union to also guarantee the safety of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The Soviet government's point that the Netherlands and Switzerland have not established diplomatic relations has also been properly considered by the United States. However, this seems to be an error at present, and it is feared that it will not be possible to avoid serious repercussions and obtain remedies. Even assuming that the two countries are willing to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and make the negotiations easier, the fact that the two countries suddenly established relations with the Soviet Union in this situation would give Germany and Italy a reason to accuse the two countries of abandoning neutrality, causing the non-aggression group to complete its task and possibly harm them. Would this not lead to disputes? Once upon a time, Austria, Britain, Portugal, Prussia, and Russia guaranteed Switzerland's permanent neutrality and the inviolability of its territory, but 91 years ago, this guarantee lost its effect. Switzerland, even if it were to meet the needs of today's international situation, may not forget this and would not want to see it reappear in disguise. The difficulties currently encountered clearly require the most subtle means to resolve, but they are not insurmountable. For this reason, the negotiations may still need to be extended for some time before they can be completed. The definite progress made in the past week is a good sign for the future. Although the Soviet Union will do its best to obtain all kinds of benefits, the degree of security that the mutual defense pact provides to the Soviet Union is indeed valuable, and the Soviet Union will not lightly give it up. Therefore, the United Kingdom and France are indeed the buyers in the market, and the seller certainly wants to do its best to obtain the greatest profit. However, the benefits that can be obtained from this exchange are enough to induce the seller not to ask for too high a price, so as not to fail at the last minute. The various countries that desire peace are united to form a close group, determined to spare no cost in all aspects of Europe to defend this unity. This move can not only guarantee peace, or at least give those who attempt to destroy peace a considerable punishment, but also have the effect of strengthening the three major powers in other parts of the world. Although the three countries did not discuss extending this pact to the Far East, there is reason to believe that the strengthening of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union in Europe is equal to the improvement of their situation in the Far East, and that their voice will be more authoritative than it is today when something happens in Europe. This is very obvious. This move, which is equivalent to a great increase in the factors of international security, is indeed a powerful support for the wish of all parties that the treaty should be completed as soon as possible. If this war-averting guarantee can be completed before the European upheaval breaks out, it may make the omnipotent country more aware that continuing to pursue its own private path will inevitably be followed by great danger, and thus have some scruples."</p>
<h3>Following Anglo-French Singapore Conference, Joint Military Exercises to be Held; Chinese Engineering Troops from Hong Kong Continuously Being Transferred to Singapore; Armed Merchant Ships Can Increase Naval Strength; British Air Force Technicians Arriving in Hong Kong in Batches</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: In order to closely coordinate and act together, the highest military authorities of the United Kingdom and France stationed in the Far East recently held a summit conference in Singapore, exchanging views on protecting the two countries' colonies in the Far East. It was decided to hold joint military exercises in the near future. All preparations for the exercises are being actively planned. A large number of military supplies from the United Kingdom have been shipped to Singapore for assembly. Regarding the employment of workers, the Hong Kong Naval Dockyard authorities sent two batches of Chinese workers to Singapore last month. The fourth batch of 80 people left for Singapore on July 1. The fifth batch of Chinese workers will continue to depart. These Chinese engineering troops were recruited in Hong Kong and, after training, were assigned to serve on various ships and naval fortresses, with responsibilities for electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering projects. Some of those who have gone to Singapore must stay in Singapore to serve, and Hong Kong will recruit several hundred more to replenish them.</p>
<p>Anglo-French Merchant Ships Prepare for Armament</p>
<p>The plan to arm merchant ships was decided long ago by the British Admiralty. Now, with the situation in the Far East becoming increasingly urgent, it has been decided to implement it in the Far East, starting with the installation of cannons on the large ships traveling to the Far East, such as the P&amp;O and Blue Funnel Line giants. Their decks have been rebuilt for gun emplacements, and the surrounding supports have been properly fitted. Other items, such as gun doors and ammunition, are also properly prepared. Medium-sized merchant ships may not be armored. The main project is to dismantle the cabins below the wheelhouse and install pillar frames behind the cranes under the foremast to withstand the recoil of the gun barrels. The project is simple, and all major shipyards in Hong Kong can carry it out. As the work is underway, officials are keeping it secret. What is known is that, with thorough preparation, the project is very fast. If all are installed, 70% of all British ships can be armed. It is also found that during the European War, each merchant ship was only equipped with one cannon, but it was limited by angle and the shooting failed. Now, two cannons are equipped on each ship, placed on the left and right sides. Generally, medium-sized merchant ships can be equipped with 7.5 to 10 cm short-range cannons, and large ships can be equipped with 12 to 15 cm medium-range cannons. After the arming of merchant ships is completed, the indirect increase in naval strength will be considerable. The French side has also begun to arm merchant ships, so that they can achieve design coordination with the United Kingdom, so that they can be used uniformly without diverging. French ships sailing to the Far East are mostly giants of more than 10,000 tons, and if necessary, they can also be incorporated into the Navy and used as special auxiliary ships.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Air Defense Vigorously Promoted</p>
<p>In view of the increasingly unsettled situation in the Far East, the Hong Kong military authorities are vigorously promoting measures to defend Hong Kong on land, sea, and air, especially paying special attention to air defense. In addition to strengthening the training and organization of public air defense knowledge and skills, the increase in air force strength is particularly urgent. According to air force sources yesterday, the Royal Air Force Station authorities stationed in Hong Kong, with the magnificent Kam Tin Airport completed, together with the current Kai Tak Royal Air Force Station, are sufficient for the stationing of a large number of air force personnel. The highest authorities of the British Air Force have decided to send air force technicians to Hong Kong for garrisoning. They have arrived in the East in batches. The first batch of 25 people arrived last month, and the second batch of 45 people arrived in Hong Kong by ship on the 29th. The second batch includes pilots, mechanics, bombing gunners, and other specialized technical talents, all of whom are excellent figures in the Air Force. As for the air force technicians that the United Kingdom has decided to transfer to Hong Kong, they will continue to arrive in Hong Kong in the short term. The Air Force Headquarters is now preparing to increase the number of air force personnel to meet urgent needs, planning to imitate the methods of the army and navy to recruit a certain number of Chinese air force soldiers to undertake all the heavy work of the air force, so that all actions in extraordinary times can be swift. Regarding the progress of this matter, the Air Force authorities have completed the planning and submitted it to the British Air Force Department for review. Once approved, the recruitment of these Chinese air force volunteers can be carried out according to the implementation plan to meet needs. As for the organization of the Air Force Volunteer Corps, the Air Force authorities believe that it is necessary to establish it as soon as possible in Hong Kong, and have drafted the entire organizational outline based on the organizational methods of the Army Volunteer Force, and submitted it to the British military department for review. It will soon be approved and implemented.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Warfare Unfolds in the Xuzhou Area; Japanese Army Burns Down Dozens of Villages, Arousing Public Resistance</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army in Xuzhou previously invaded the guerrilla teams in the counties of Tongxiao, Lingbi, and Suxian on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui in seven routes. They were severely attacked by the guerrilla teams respectively, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army also suffered heavy casualties, and then moved to a suitable location to reorganize its strength and try to counterattack. When the Japanese army withdrew from Xuzhou, they burned dozens of villages, including Yuntai, Qucong, Tuantuan, Caiyuan, and Guiyou, as a retaliatory measure. As a result, the people on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui have an extremely strong sense of resistance. In addition to eliminating all the puppet organizations in various places, the small number of Japanese soldiers in the Japanese army strongholds in southern Xuzhou have been resolved separately. A few days ago, the railway bridges between Caocun and Sanbao on the Jinpu Railway were destroyed, causing a Japanese army train to overturn. The Japanese army has continued to increase troops to the stations on the Jinpu Railway to protect them. They have learned that the guerrilla units in eastern and northern Xuzhou are particularly active with a certain route army. Guerrilla warfare has been launched in the counties of Xiao, Pei, and other counties in western Xuzhou, making it impossible for the Japanese army to defend against and exhausting them. The armed forces in the counties have established close ties to carry out guerrilla work.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Guangzhou Forcibly Conscripts Young Men; Trains Puppet Police as a Tool for Preventing Chinese Army; Prosperous Areas Designated as Japanese Business Districts; Hong Kong Western Newspaper Reports Sudden Withdrawal of Japanese Army from Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, it has been attacked by plainclothes guerrillas and special operations teams of the Chinese army. The puppet police in the city are not substantial and their strength is empty. Therefore, most of them dare not stand guard at night. The Japanese army commander, Ando, decided to enhance the so-called "security" strength. In addition to ordering the Japanese gendarmerie to increase the number of gendarmes patrolling the streets day and night to monitor the puppet police, he also ordered the puppet municipal government to recruit 1,000 puppet police officers to stand guard. After receiving the order, the puppet municipal government decided to transfer young men from merchants in the city for training and assign them to the puppet police. Guangzhou was divided into five major districts, and young men were transferred from households in each district. If no young men were handed over, each household would have to pay a "security fee" of five yuan, otherwise they would be arrested and severely punished. A notice was issued by the puppet municipal government on June 15, ordering all merchants to comply with it by the end of the month. Therefore, the young men in the city have fled.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the search, the Japanese army in Guangzhou forced all shops in the city to resume business, and encouraged Japanese merchants to set up shops and conduct so-called "commercial loans." The most prosperous areas in the city, such as Huiai Middle Road, Hanmin Road, Xihao, and Changdi, were designated as "Japanese business districts." If Japanese merchants operate in these designated areas, each store will be stationed with a Japanese soldier to prevent attacks by the Chinese army's special operations teams. However, Japanese merchants dare not do business because they are aware that goods cannot be sold and that special operations teams and guerrillas often appear in the city, making it impossible to defend against. Therefore, the Japanese army launched its so-called "security campaign" on June 18 and 19. In addition to the Japanese army commander Ando personally convening all Japanese merchants in the city, announcing his determination to eliminate "bad elements" in the city within a time limit to ensure the smooth operation of Japanese business in the future, he ordered the puppet municipal government to work with the Japanese gendarmerie to implement emergency martial law from the 20th, attempting to reduce the surprise attacks by special operations teams and guerrillas. But in fact, it is difficult to achieve results, only increasing the tense atmosphere in the city.</p>
<p>According to the Smets Western Newspaper in Hong Kong on the 28th, the newspaper suddenly received a report from a special commissioner stationed in Shamian, saying that the Japanese army occupying Guangzhou suddenly withdrew starting on the 27th. Although the news has not been officially confirmed, it is quite reliable. According to the report of the special commissioner, the Japanese army stationed in Guangzhou suddenly disappeared completely. Even the important strongholds in the urban area were not guarded by the Japanese army. Changdi, a transportation hub, is very important and was guarded by the Japanese navy and army, and was heavily guarded. But from the 27th, the trace of the Japanese army was nowhere to be seen. Even the defensive works arranged in the past were all dismantled. On the Baietan River, many Japanese gunboats were moored in the past, but they also disappeared at the same time, their whereabouts unknown. It is not clear what the Japanese navy and army intended to withdraw suddenly this time, because there has been no drastic change in Guangzhou recently. According to general observation, if the news of the withdrawal of the Japanese army from Guangzhou is confirmed, it is expected to be due to the extremely unfavorable current international situation for the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Puppet Government of Yangzhou Controls the Export of Cattle; Must Pay Taxes Before Release</h3>
<p>Taixing Correspondence: Cattle are produced in Jiangbei, mostly vegetable cattle. Farm cattle produced in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province, are the most capable of working. Since the war of resistance, the loss of farm cattle in the counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been enormous. Farmers, forced by economics, are unable to buy them. Several families jointly raise a cow and cooperate. Shanghai needs cattle from Jiangbei every day. Recently, the puppet county government of Yangzhou has set up "Vegetable Cattle Inspection Offices" in Dayi, Guazhou, Aozi Street, and other places, and designated Dayi as a cattle concentration point and Guazhou as a key point for export. Puppet officials are stationed to guard them. All cattle must pay donations to be released, implementing control to achieve their means of extortion.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Order in the Concessions: Both Concessions are Highly Vigilant, Blocking Major Roads Last Night, and Implementing Strict Searches at Key Transportation Points</h3>
<p>Eduard Road and other major roads, as well as smaller, less frequented streets, were blocked off before 10:30 PM last night. In the International Settlement, barbed wire was deployed at the intersections of Eduard Road Bund, Jiangxi Road, Shandong Road, Seymour Road, Weihaiwei Road, Hardoon Road, Hart Road, Yu Yuen Road, Edinburgh Road, Jessfield Road, Wuzhen Road Bridge, Xizang Road Bridge, and Pentang Lane Bridge, effectively prohibiting passage. Additionally, along Eduard Road, the barbed wire was temporarily placed on the sidewalks on both sides of Longmen Road, Race Course Road, Rue Massenet, Chongqing Road, Chengdu Road, and Tongfu Road, ready for immediate use if needed. Although obstacles were also set up at key points such as Sichuan Road, Fujian Road, Hubei Road, and Yu Qiaqing Road, these will serve as transportation arteries between the North and South today. However, all pedestrians, vehicles, and even the smallest items will be subject to rigorous searches before being allowed to pass. In the French Concession, Zhubao Road, the east-west parts of Rue de la Soeur, and Route Gustaves were completely blocked. Particular attention was paid to the area along Eduard Road, with patrol cars constantly moving back and forth. All entertainment venues were temporarily advised by the police to close early. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Concession Police: Unified Precautionary Measures</p>
<p>From the 2nd of the current month, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council have instructed their respective police forces, including the Central Police Station, Laozha Police Station, Xinzha Police Station, Chengdu Road Police Station, Gordon Road Police Station, Putuo Road Police Station, Jing'an Temple Police Station, North District, Haines Road Police Station (also known as Wayside Police Station), Hongkou District, Wayside Police Station (also known as Hongkou Police Station), Dixwell Road Police Station, Jiaxing Road Police Station, Yulin Road Police Station, Tilanqiao Police Station, Yangshupu Police Station, as well as the French Concession's Route Tenant Central Police Station, Xujiahui Police Station, Foch Road Police Station, Petain Road Police Station, Avenue Joffre Police Station, Old North Gate Police Station, and Small East Gate Police Station, to deploy all Chinese, Western, and Indian plainclothes detectives and uniformed officers. They will be stationed at key intersections such as road crossings, tram stops, and bus stations to inspect suspicious pedestrians and vehicles. After dark, blue wire mesh vehicles and armored cars are dispatched to patrol the roads throughout the night. As a result, the local area has been very peaceful in recent days. Starting last night, more posts were added, and the red patrol cars of the Public Concession Police also went out to search various locations. When necessary, traffic on some roads and bridges may be blocked. Additionally, along the borders between the Hongkou, Zhabei, and western Shanghai Chinese areas and the concessions, such as Waibaidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Wuzhen Road Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, Zao Bi Chang Bridge, Caojiadu, Beixinjing, Railway Bridge, and Hongqiao Road, Japanese soldiers have also increased their numbers starting yesterday and are strictly checking pedestrians entering and exiting. They are particularly strict about inspecting passes and vaccination certificates, and anyone with discrepancies is not allowed to pass.</p>
<p>Western District: Increased Vigilance</p>
<p>The Western District, adjacent to the occupied area, is prone to unexpected incidents. To strengthen security, the concession authorities had previously made arrangements for precautionary measures. Specifically, starting yesterday afternoon, patrol cars and armored vehicles were dispatched to constantly patrol the borders, barbed wire was added to intersections, and more uniformed and plainclothes police officers were deployed along the roads to inspect pedestrians and suppress any potential disturbances. The Japanese side has also tightened defenses within the occupied area. Yesterday, the situation at traffic points such as Hongqiao Road and Route Henri Brenier became serious. It is rumored that traffic may be cut off at any time. In recent days, rumors have been rampant in the suburbs of Shanghai, and Japanese troops and puppet police detectives are frequently searching the countryside, causing panic among residents who are fleeing to Shanghai.</p>
<p>French Park: Searched Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the French police sent personnel to search the area around Sande Lane on Rue Sapey. In the afternoon, police officers searched tourists in the French Park on Avenue Dubail. In the evening, pedestrians were rigorously searched on all major streets.</p>
<p>Punan Ferries: All Suspended</p>
<p>The ferries from the concession to Bailianjing and Liuliqiao on the southern Huangpu River have been suspended since the 6th because the ferry crossings have been locked down, prohibiting all ships and pedestrians from passing. Security at Zhoujiadu, Nanmatou, and Damatou wharves has also been tightened in recent days, and the search of pedestrians is stricter than usual. All Punan ferries have been completely suspended. Although the Gaohang, Gaomiao, and Donggou ferries in Pudong continued to operate as usual on the 6th, the number of passengers decreased due to the stricter security at the ferry crossings.</p>
<p>Suzhou Creek Waterway: Completely Interrupted</p>
<p>Starting at 2:00 PM yesterday, the Japanese side dispatched troops to drive civilian boats downstream in the upper reaches of the Suzhou Creek. All boats were driven away from the section of the creek from Caojiadu to Zhoujiaqiao and Beixinjing. Cargo ships traveling upstream from the mouth of the Suzhou Creek were also blocked and not allowed to pass. As a result, the waterway in the upper reaches of the Suzhou Creek was completely cut off.</p>
<p>Hongkou Area: Undeclared Martial Law</p>
<p>From 8:00 AM yesterday, undeclared martial law was imposed in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas. The Japanese side dispatched a large number of troops. The troops stationed at the Shiga Unit at 632 Yangshupu Road in the Xinhua Trust Company, the Hayama Unit at 320 Yulin Road in the Hua Yi Printing Company, the Katamura Unit at 26 Liaoyang Road, the Watanabe Unit in Pingliang New Village on Pingliang Road, and the Kanetani Kempeitai Unit at 256 Pingliang Road were divided into sections for patrols and searches of pedestrians at any time. The shifts rotated and continued until late at night, creating a tense situation.</p>
<h3>Admiral Sir Percy Noble: Receptions During His Visit to Fujian; News from the Japanese Naval Spokesperson; British Personnel at a Radio Station Allowed to Land</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the Japanese Navy spokesperson claimed yesterday (the 5th) at a reception for journalists that Admiral Sir Percy Noble, commander-in-chief of the British fleet in China, departed from Hong Kong and passed through the mouth of the Min River on Saturday morning, staying there. The British and Japanese flagships anchored at Fuzhou exchanged visits. Admiral Noble expressed his gratitude for the Japanese side's facilitation of foreigners' withdrawal from Fuzhou. It was also revealed at the reception that the Great Eastern Telegraph Company, which has a transmitting and receiving station at Sharp Peak, requested permission from the Japanese authorities for four British engineers to land on the island to take care of the company's equipment. The Japanese side has granted permission, but they will only be allowed to land tomorrow. If the company's telegraph equipment is not taken care of, it will be destroyed. The spokesperson also stated that the commander of the only British warship currently docked in Fuzhou, the HMS Gannet No. 64, and a representative of the Great Eastern Telegraph Company recently visited the Japanese commander-in-chief, stating that there was no wired or wireless communication between Sharp Peak and Fuzhou. However, there is evidence proving that the island has Chinese military cables, which is why no one is temporarily allowed to land.</p>
<h3>French Mail Ship Félix Roussel: Arriving in Shanghai from Europe; Expected to Arrive at 6:00 PM Today; Passengers Arriving at the New Customs House at 7:30 PM</h3>
<p>The French Postal Company's eastbound mail ship Félix Roussel departed from Marseille on the 9th of last month and passed Hong Kong the day before yesterday. According to the company, the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai at around 6:00 PM today and will dock at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong.

In addition, the company's Zhenrusha returned to Shanghai from Kobe yesterday and is scheduled to return to Marseille from Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Relief Association Notice: Strictly Implementing Thrift; Operating the Most Efficient Enterprise with Minimum Expenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association recently issued a notice to its subordinate groups to strictly implement thrift, stating that the association's work is expanding daily, and administrative expenses are therefore increasing, which is a normal matter. However, public welfare and charitable organizations should strive for the long term, and society's expectations are also high. All groups of the association should aim for practicality and truthfulness in their work, and should not engage in superficial decorations or pursue external embellishments. What one person can do should not be done by two, and what one group can handle should not be handled by two groups. Strict organization and solid structure will not only increase efficiency but also avoid wasting public funds. In particular, the expenses of each group should be carefully considered from an economic point of view, and thrift should be strictly implemented to operate the most efficient relief enterprise with the lowest administrative expenses.</p>
<p>Donating Funeral Offerings to Aid Refugees</p>
<p>The citizens' fundraising committee of the Refugee Relief Association approved a letter yesterday from Wu Xianghong of the Tai Yong Tea Firm, stating: "Dear Sirs, I respectfully inform you that a memorial service was held at Guoen Temple on June 19 for the late Madam Bai. I am deeply grateful for the generous offerings from relatives and friends, totaling more than 380 yuan in cash and more than 70 silk banners, as well as many eulogies and elegiac couplets. I now donate the cash and silk banners to charitable organizations for the benefit of my friends. In addition to allocating funds to the Huining Guild Hall and other charitable organizations, I respectfully offer 100 yuan in legal tender and 35 silk banners, requesting that you accept them and sell them for use in refugee relief, and please provide a receipt as a courtesy."</p>
<p>Refugee Education Committee: Fifth Meeting</p>
<p>The Education Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its fifth meeting yesterday. Chairman Xi Yushu first read the minutes of the previous meeting, followed by reports from various departments on their work progress. The following was then discussed: 1. Whether to continue the compulsory schools. It was resolved that the compulsory schools would continue next year, and whether to expand them would depend on the burden of refugee education next year. The name should be changed to the association's No. X Refugee School. 2. The name and management of the refugee middle school. Mr. Shen Yu, a director of the refugee middle school, reported on the establishment of the refugee middle school. It was resolved that the subsidy would remain the same, and the subsidy name and management would remain the same as before. The association will not add its name or manage its administration. 3. Review of applications for educational funding from various organizations. It was resolved that the Education Department would send a letter to each organization requesting a detailed report in list form, to be discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Navigation: Britain's Firm Stance; Disregarding Japanese Obstruction; Japanese Companies Plan to Monopolize Everything</h3>
<p>Japan is attempting to monopolize China's shipping industry and obstruct the passage of ships from third countries, which is affecting all countries. Japan has taken the lead in Chinese navigation. Britain is striving to maintain navigation to China, and Japanese companies are making every effort to expand their routes. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shipping Industries of All Countries: Affected</p>
<p>Japan obstructs the navigation of third countries in China by: (1) inspecting and detaining ships from various countries; (2) blockading ports in non-occupied areas and areas controlled by guerrillas; (3) using military operations as an excuse to prevent foreign ships from sailing; (4) forcing the Jianghai Customs to refuse clearance from inland ports. As a result, the shipping industries of various countries have been greatly affected. For example, the statistics for merchant ships traveling to foreign countries in May showed that Japan ranked first with 768 ships, totaling 1,060,582 tons; Britain ranked second with 340 ships, totaling 993,911 tons; and Germany ranked third with 29 ships, totaling 160,458 tons.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu Navigation: Controlled by Japan</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side prevented foreign ships from sailing to Haimen and Funing in Jiangsu, now that Hexing Town in Funing and Qinglong Port in Haimen have been occupied by the Japanese army, foreign ships have been allowed to resume sailing. (1) The ships sailing to Qinglong Port (i.e., Beishaqian) are the Yihe, Jiangding, Haiyi, Paide, Deyaoyao, Wantong, Lisha, and Tingxi. (2) The Xishang Liwuduo has been allowed to sail to Hexing Town (i.e., Funing Line). The ship is scheduled to clear customs on the 12th and depart directly from Shanghai to Hexing Town on the 13th. However, the ships sailing to Qinglong Port and Hexing Town must be subject to the orders of the Japanese army and control everything.</p>
<p>British Companies Strive to Maintain Routes</p>
<p>British companies such as Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, in addition to striving to maintain their original routes in China in the face of Japanese obstruction, are still dispatching ships as usual and have decided to request British warships to protect the ships when necessary. For example, the ships sailing on the Shanghai-Hong Kong route still call at Shantou. The ports of Quanzhou, Fuzhou, Xinghua, Shacheng, and Sandu'ao in Fujian are not being abandoned, and ships will continue to be dispatched. The British company Jardine Matheson's Yihe, which sails on the Beisha line, is now implementing the protection of British warships and sailing. In addition, new routes have been opened between China and overseas countries. In addition to the Shanghai defense line, a Shanghai-Siam route will be opened.</p>
<p>Japanese Companies Expand Coastal Navigation</p>
<p>Japanese shipping companies are making every effort to expand their shipping business in China. In addition to buying or leasing old ships, they are also planning to build new ships with tonnage ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 tons, specializing in sailing to various coastal ports in China. The routes in Qingdao, Yantai, Longkou, Weihaiwei, Tianjin, and other places in North China, as well as in the three northeastern provinces, are now monopolized by Japanese companies such as Nisshin and Dalian. Recently, they have been trying to monopolize the routes in South China. In addition to the Shanghai-Xiamen line, which has already been opened, the Shanghai-Hong Kong line will also be opened. Therefore, the shipping business of third countries to China will be completely seized by Japan.</p>
<h3>Parcel Stamps: Purchased and Affixed on the Spot; Purchased at Each Counter; Failure to Comply May Result in Suspension of Mailing</h3>
<p>Mr. Chapellain, Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, is trying to simplify the procedures for sending parcels. He recently issued another notice to all parcel senders, stating that recently some parcel senders have been purchasing stamps for postage elsewhere and affixing them when sending parcels at the various parcel sections of the bureau, resulting in a large discrepancy between the actual amount affixed on the parcels and the number of stamps sold by each parcel section. For the convenience of verification, all parcels sent at the parcel sections of the bureau should have the required stamps purchased from the ticket sales window of each section. The bureau issued a notice on December 7, 1938, regarding this matter, but it has been found that the above-mentioned situation still occurs, so another notice is issued. If parcel senders have already purchased a large number of stamps and have not yet used them, they must bring the stamps to the Parcel Business Section for registration between the 5th and 6th of this month (9:00 AM to 4:00 PM). After this registration, all parcel senders sending parcels must purchase the required stamps at the relevant parcel section, except for those who have already registered and are allowed to use them. For purchases of stamps of 50 yuan or more, a "Stamp Purchase Form" must be filled out. The second copy of this "Stamp Purchase Form" must be torn off by the ticket seller after stamping, and the parcel sender must submit it. Failure to comply may result in the bureau suspending acceptance.</p>
<h3>Foreign Shipping Companies: Planning to Resume Shanghai-Ningbo Route; Moufuku Returned to Shanghai Yesterday and Will Still Sail to Zhenhai Tomorrow; Companies are Estimating the Cost of Resumption</h3>
<p>The German company Rehders' Moufuku returned to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday afternoon. The ship is scheduled to continue sailing to Zhenhai tomorrow morning, berthing outside the port. Zhongyi Taikoo and other shipping companies are also planning to dispatch ships to resume the route. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Moufuku Reports: Blockade Situation</p>
<p>After the Japanese army landed in Dinghai, the situation in Zhejiang became tense, and the authorities ordered the blockade of Zhenhai Port in Ningbo, prohibiting foreign ships from entering and exiting the Yong River to strengthen defenses. According to a telegram received by the Italian company Zhongyi, the old Taiping, which was berthed at the China Merchants Wharf in Zhenhai and kept in reserve to be sunk to block the gap, was sunk at 9:00 PM on the 28th of last month. However, the German company Rehders has not yet received the above-mentioned telegram, so it believes that although traffic has been blocked, the Taiping will not be sunk. Therefore, there are conflicting reports, and people from Zhejiang in Shanghai are particularly concerned, hoping that the Taiping will not be sunk. It is heard that the Taiping has indeed been moved to the side of the blockade line and can be sunk at any time. The gap has not been completely blocked, so barges can still enter and exit through the gaps.</p>
<p>Passengers and Cargo: Loaded and Unloaded at the Mouth of the Port</p>
<p>The German company Rehders' Moufuku was specially approved by the Ningbo Defense Command to continue sailing to Ningbo once after the Yong River was blocked. However, because the gap has been closed to navigation, it was unable to enter the port, and all passengers and cargo were loaded and unloaded at the mouth of the port and transferred to Ningbo. It has now been unloaded and set sail for Shanghai at 4:00 AM yesterday, arriving at the port at 2:30 PM that afternoon, and the ship docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. The Moufuku has decided to continue sailing to maintain traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo, and will berth outside the port when it arrives in Ningbo, with passengers and cargo transferred by tugboats. It has now been decided that it will depart straight to Zhenhai tomorrow morning (the 8th).</p>
<p>Zhongyi Taikoo: Also Planning to Resume the Route</p>
<p>The Italian company Zhongyi and the British company Butterfield &amp; Swire are also planning to dispatch ships such as De Pingxin and New Beijing to restore the Shanghai-Ningbo route. They are currently estimating whether the cost of transporting goods and the income from fares can cover the expenses. Once the planning is complete, they can start sailing. The decision of the German company Moufuku to continue sailing to Ningbo tomorrow morning proves that foreign ships are indeed determined to restore navigation to maintain their shipping rights in China. However, whether they can sail smoothly is another matter.</p>
<p>Situation in Ningbo: Peaceful as Usual</p>
<p>Since Ningbo was repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, all residents of the city have automatically evacuated and moved to the countryside. Business is now conducted at night, and the situation has become even more depressed since the obstruction of shipping in Ningbo. However, the order has been quite peaceful in recent days, and air raid alarms are frequent, but Japanese aircraft have not bombed in the past ten days. As for the end of June this year, which was originally the settlement period for the business community, the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce decided to temporarily postpone the June settlement due to the special circumstances and the depressed market.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police: Re-registration of Publications; Newspapers, Magazines, and News Agencies, etc., Must Re-register with the Bureau within This Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police has decided to re-register all registered newspapers, magazines, and news agencies. All newspapers, magazines, and news agencies in the city should submit their registration certificates to the Political Department of the police within this month for re-registration. Failure to do so will be considered invalid.</p>

The ramie cloth industry is the same case and has sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting permission to transport the ramie cloth by barge and ship to Shanghai to meet market sales.</p>
<h3>客帮惟利是圖　滬米運銷外埠　租界當局決予杜絕　存米略减洋米起運</h3>
<p>Profit-Driven Merchants Ship Rice from Shanghai to Other Ports; Concession Authorities Resolve to Stop It; Rice Reserves Slightly Decrease as Foreign Rice Shipments Begin</p>
<p>The price of rice in the Shanghai market has previously risen because of the speculative merchants seeking personal gain, and the rice prices were raised automatically, resulting in a food panic among Shanghai citizens. Afterward, the H Department Bureau intervened, setting a maximum price limit of twenty-one yuan for the highest grade of white rice. Currently, some ignorant rice merchants act as brokers, buying and selling rice and shipping it in large quantities to other ports for huge profits. The authorities are paying close attention to this matter. The fourteenth survey of rice stocks in all Shanghai rice warehouses was released yesterday, totaling 399,902 bags, a decrease of 36,525 bags from last week. This is a normal phenomenon during the transition between harvests. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Merchants Seek Profit, Shipping Out for Sale</p>
<p>Since the maximum price of white rice was set at twenty-one yuan in the bean and rice market, and the standard prices for medium and lower grades were also set, and the Public Works Department dispatched inspectors to the market during trading hours to supervise, those manipulating the market were unable to use their tricks. Market confidence has stabilized, and it has now returned to its former state. It is reported that merchants from various provinces have recently been quite active, purchasing and hoarding large quantities to be shipped to other ports for sale, seeking huge profits. This action has a significant impact on the future of the people's food supply. If reserves decrease in the future and changes occur in the rice market, the rice merchants should bear full responsibility. The Concession authorities will prevent this outflow of food rice to maintain the food supply within the concession. Yesterday, the sources from various places did not increase. More than 4,000 bags were loaded and transported, and three or four boats arrived from the lower reaches of the river. The ban in Wuxi and other places has not yet been lifted. A total of 3,600 to 3,700 bags were traded in the market this morning. It is also learned that the Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at 15 Avenue Edward VII will be closed for one day today.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Shipments Begin; No Worry About Food Supply</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiring with the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, it was learned that the survey of rice stocks in Shanghai rice warehouses was released by the Association yesterday. However, due to the continuous heavy rain in recent days, transportation has been difficult, resulting in a scarcity of domestic rice sources and a decrease in total rice reserves throughout the city, totaling 399,902 bags, a decrease of 36,525 bags from last week. However, this is a necessary phenomenon during the transition between harvests. Moreover, rice industry estimates suggest that there are still more than 200,000 bags of rice stored in the sales departments of various rice shops and purchased by citizens, sufficient for three months of consumption. Therefore, there is no risk of food shortage in Shanghai. In addition, a huge quantity of foreign rice from Saigon has already been shipped and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-July, at which time reserves will increase significantly, and the selling price may continue to fall.</p>

<h3>統一公債　本息定期付款　準定七月底起改付滙劃　暗市各債上漲人心益穩</h3>
<p>Unified Bonds: Principal and Interest Paid on Schedule; Payment to Be Made by Remittance Starting End of July; Increased Confidence as Black Market Bonds Rise</p>
<p>Since a telegram from Chongqing announced the suspension of principal and interest payments on unified bonds guaranteed by customs duties, unified bonds in the Shanghai securities black market have fallen sharply. Now, because the Ministry of Finance is maintaining creditworthiness and has decided not to change its policies, measures have been ordered for the payment of principal and interest on unified bonds due at the end of July. It is rumored that payments will be made as usual through remittance notes, causing bonds in the securities black market to rise again. The lottery for the Financial Reconstruction Bonds has been scheduled for the 10th of this month. According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency who inquired with the National Debt Fund Management Committee, the amount of the seventh principal and interest payment due on July 31 for unified bonds is estimated to be 7,852,500 yuan for type A bonds, 5,715,000 yuan for type B bonds, 12,985,000 yuan for type C bonds, 20,040,500 yuan for type D bonds, and 9,646,000 yuan for type E bonds, totaling 56,640,350 yuan. Yesterday, the securities black market was greatly pleased to learn of this news and was more confident. Prices all rose. The closing prices for yesterday are recorded below: Type A, 60.1 yuan; Type B, 51 yuan; Type C, 49.6 yuan; Type D, 48.8 yuan; Type E, 49.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>浙閩戰雲漸緊　日艦砲轟玉環穿山再圖登陸　鎭海福州長門前日均有空襲　本埠航業界所得消息</h3>
<p>War Clouds Gather over Zhejiang and Fujian; Japanese Warships Shell Yuhuan and Chuanshan, Attempting to Land Again; Zhenhai, Fuzhou, and Changmen All Suffered Air Raids the Day Before; News from Shipping Industry in This City</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, news was received from the shipping industry that around 7:00 a.m. on the 5th, more than 200 Japanese soldiers, under the cover of intense fire from Japanese warships, attempted to land on Yuhuan again. Local troops immediately resisted, resulting in fierce fighting. Currently, five Japanese warships are anchored outside Wenzhou, shelling the coast from time to time. The situation remains tense. However, the Chinese military authorities have made strict arrangements and are calmly responding.</p>
<p>Zhenhai Suffers Two More Air Raids</p>
<p>Zhenhai was again invaded by two Japanese aircraft around 8:00 a.m. the day before (the 5th), which dropped multiple bombs in the urban area, indiscriminately bombing. Around 9:00 a.m., three Japanese naval aircraft returned and wreaked havoc again, dropping six bombs outside the South Gate. The largest Zhenxingtai General Merchandise Store there was hit by a bomb, and the mill was completely destroyed, killing and injuring more than ten people. Currently, three Japanese warships are anchored in the Liqu Harbor waters outside Zhenhai, but there is no change in their movements. It is reported that Fenghua was also bombed.</p>
<p>Three Japanese Warships Shell Chuanshan</p>
<p>Around 8:00 a.m. on the 5th, three Japanese warships fired from their positions in the waters off Chuanshan, firing more than a dozen shells. Chinese losses were minimal. The Japanese military's attempt seems to be to probe the strength of the Chinese army. They have previously attempted to land there several times but were met with strong resistance from the Chinese army and failed. It is because the Chinese military authorities had deployed heavy troops there and the defense is extremely solid. Currently, two Japanese warships are still anchored off Chuanshan and have not left.</p>
<p>More Than Ten Japanese Aircraft Bomb Fujian Territory</p>
<p>The situation in Minjiang is tense because the number of Japanese warships has continued to increase to twenty-seven or twenty-eight, frequently harassing the coast with shelling, and Japanese aircraft have resumed bombing along the coast. It is reported that more than ten Japanese aircraft bombed Fuzhou and Changmen in batches on the morning of the 5th. The losses are unknown.</p>
<p>Japanese Izumo Warship Sails to Fujian Sea</p>
<p>The Japanese Izumo flag and the Japanese consulate wharf had been docked for several months. At 2:00 p.m. the day before, it suddenly weighed anchor and left Shanghai. It is said that its destination is to sail to the Fujian sea area to direct operations. It is also learned that another destroyer also sailed out before the Izumo weighed anchor.</p>
<h3>日機　轟炸北橋</h3>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Beiqiao</p>
<p>In Caohejing Town in western Shanghai, the Japanese officer Nishimura previously instigated Han Jun to organize an armed puppet police department, which has now established five squadrons with six to seven hundred men, some of whom are armed. However, a few days ago, Moriyama, the Japanese instructor in Beiqiao, negotiated with Nishimura to borrow a puppet police squadron to guard Beiqiao. After Nishimura agreed, he dispatched the fourth squadron to accompany them. When they arrived in the town, all the puppet police defected. Afterward, the Japanese side deeply regretted losing two new-style machine guns and more than a hundred rifles. Therefore, in addition to seriously negotiating with Moriyama, the Japanese side has now dispatched aircraft to fly around and scout in the skies around Beiqiao. It was once bombed by Japanese aircraft the day before. The extent of the damage to civilians will be investigated and recorded later.</p>
<h3>缺乏排水河渠　租界馬路泛濫　西區無正當管理機關　數處路面因大水浮起</h3>
<p>Lack of Drainage Canals, Concession Roads Flood; No Proper Management Agency in the West District; Several Road Surfaces Float Due to Flooding</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that James, the chief of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, told reporters yesterday (the 5th) that the lack of effective drainage canals west of the Public Concession's boundary has caused serious flooding problems in the Public Concession in recent days. The area has no drainage ditches under proper municipal management, causing the flooding situation in the Public Concession to be worse than usual at this time of year. The Public Works Department has not been able to estimate the extent of the damage caused by the flooding after last week's heavy rain in a few days. The roads between Avenue Foch and Jing'an Temple Road have suffered the most damage, but the roads in the west district have indeed had large areas of road surface floated up due to flooding.</p>

<h3>新申請法頒布後　外匯暗市漸鬆　進口商對必需品外匯停止購結　準備直接向中交兩行依法申請</h3>
<p>After the Promulgation of the New Application Law, the Black Market for Foreign Exchange Gradually Eases; Importers Stop Buying Foreign Exchange for Essential Goods and Prepare to Apply Directly to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Accordance with the Law</p>
<p>In order to prohibit the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods and promote the export of local goods, the Ministry of Finance has successively promulgated rules on the settlement and receipt of exchange differences for goods and the application for foreign exchange for essential goods. The Central Bank has stopped handling application matters, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications supply the legal foreign exchange to importers based on the approval notice from the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee, and collect the difference between the legal price and the bank's listed price. However, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks in Shanghai have not yet received the order from the Ministry and the notice from the head office, so it has not been decided when to implement it. According to a reporter from the New News Agency, the Central Bank's legal price has remained unchanged as usual in recent days. HSBC Bank still supplies the black market needs at an exchange rate of about six pence, but since various banks and businesses have restricted deposits and withdrawals, there is a shortage of cash, and speculators have no way to purchase it. At the same time, some importers can apply to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for foreign exchange for essential goods, and have stopped buying on the black market and are preparing to apply to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in accordance with the law. Therefore, the exchange rate in the black market for foreign exchange is gradually easing and stabilizing.</p>
<p>The Exchange Market Has Stabilized This Week</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 6th that the foreign exchange market has tended to stabilize on Monday and Tuesday of the past week. This is probably a phenomenon that people have expected, because after the implementation of the remittance system, the flow of funds is too lacking. Therefore, this has forced some foreign exchange holders to sell in order to obtain cash to serve as resources for clearing at the end of June. In this situation, some speculators inevitably suffered heavy losses. However, this man-made stable exchange market is a pity that it cannot last long. Therefore, from Wednesday onwards, speculators who bought foreign exchange came one after another, and a huge difference also occurred between the near and distant terms of foreign exchange. However, at this time, HSBC Bank fortunately sold foreign exchange at a price of six and nine-sixteenths pence, so the general public's confidence was stabilized again. By Thursday, there were also sellers of foreign exchange for July at a price of six and three-eighths pence. By Friday, the exchange market had changed again, and buyers had to pay five-sixteenths pence more than six pence for foreign exchange due in July.</p>
<h3>綸昌罷工者要求　罷工費五十萬　朱玉軫竟謂公司無誠意　英總領向日領提出交涉</h3>
<p>LUNCHANG Strikers Demand 500,000 Strike Fee; Zhu Yuzhen Actually Says the Company Lacks Sincerity; British Consul General Lodges Protest with Japanese Consul</p>
<p>The China Press reported that regarding the strike that occurred some time ago in the factory of the Lunchang Dyeing and Printing Company, the company has continued to receive intimidation. The British Consul General, Philip, therefore visited the Japanese Consul General, Miura, yesterday (the 5th) afternoon and lodged written and oral protests. It is reported that the company received this intimidation on Tuesday. Previously, the company informed Zhu Yuzhen, the director of the Southern District Administration, that the strikers' demand for a "strike fee" of</p>
<p>500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>was illegal and absurd. Zhu then notified the Lunchang manager in writing on Tuesday afternoon, saying that according to the strikers' opinion, the company lacked sincerity and did not agree to the workers' demands, which may result in damage to the company's interests. Regarding this point, it must be stated that negotiations to amend the Lunchang factory strike have been going on for more than a day. According to recent observations, various long-pending points can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. Approximately 97% of the workers</p>
<p>Eager to Resume Work</p>
<p>In the British Consul General's protest, he called on the Japanese Consul General to pay attention to the special nature of the strikers' demands, saying that this matter has exceeded the scope of ordinary labor disputes, and the workers are undoubtedly being intimidated and coerced by destructive elements. He also said that the Japanese Consul General would give a written guarantee to fully protect the Lunchang factories in Zhoujiazui and Bailianjing in Pudong. Philip also requested that in view of Zhu's threatening words, the Japanese Consul General should make every effort to fully fulfill these promises and provide full protection for the lives and property of the British people in the factory.</p>
<h3>難民收容所接管後　救世軍之措施　襄助貧困者使其自立　能自立後卽遣之他適</h3>
<p>Salvation Army Measures After Taking Over Refugee Shelter; Helping the Poor to Become Self-Reliant; Those Who Can Be Self-Reliant Are Sent Elsewhere</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported yesterday (the 5th) that the Dunxin Road Refugee Shelter, formerly directly managed by the Shanghai Refugee Relief United Association, has recently been taken over by the Salvation Army. It is learned that the shelter was built at the beginning of this year under the auspices of the Shanghai Refugee Relief United Association and can accommodate more than 10,000 refugees. Currently, about 8,000 poor people are living there. The reporter met with Brigadier Morris, the commander of the Shanghai Salvation Army, yesterday. According to his talk, the Salvation Army took over the shelter on July 1. The management committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief United Association wanted to place the shelter under the management of a group with</p>
<p>Refugee Work</p>
<p>experience, so it negotiated with them in the spring. As a result of the negotiations, the Salvation Army accepted the proposal, and the Salvation Army headquarters in Beiping also agreed to send personnel to assist the Salvation Army in this city. Although the shelter was previously managed by private individuals hired by the rescue groups in this city, the Salvation Army will handle the shelter entirely with its own personnel.</p>
<p>New Manager</p>
<p>is Adjutant Gu Baotian (transliteration), who is experienced in relief work, went to Europe to study relief issues, and recently returned to China. Gu and the other two assistants belong to the Shanghai Salvation Army, and there are also four "officers" from the Beiping headquarters. Although the shelter is completely managed by the Salvation Army, the Shanghai Refugee Relief United Association will continue to</p>
<p>Provide Assistance as Before</p>
<p>Previously, the shelter was operated on the basis of two yuan per refugee. Brigadier Mo criticized the general policy of the new managers, saying that they will now focus on "cleaning up" the refugee situation in the entire Shanghai area. The Salvation Army intends to help these poor people become self-reliant, and after they can be self-reliant, they will</p>
<p>Send Them Elsewhere</p>
<p>and resume accommodating refugees from other shelters in the city. The school in the shelter previously enrolled more than 1,300 children and was divided into three parts because the classrooms in the shelter were insufficient. Several handicraft factories have also been set up in the shelter so that a large number of refugees can find employment. These handicraft factories will continue to operate under the strict management of the shelter authorities.</p>

He worked as a watch repairman at the Xieshun Clock and Watch Shop at 486 Fuzhou Road. A month ago, Yuan became involved with a dissolute woman surnamed Fang, 29 years old. The two sides were passionately in love. Recently, his legal wife found out and gathered a team of more than ten women and went to Fang's house, completely destroying the items in her room, and then dispersed. The day before, Yuan Jiazheng had an argument with his wife because of this incident. Afterward, Yuan left home in anger and went to Fang's house, and went with Fang to Yangzi Hotel on Sanma Road, where they checked into room 620. After paying the room fee, they closed the door. Yesterday at about 2:00 p.m., the tea boy heard moaning in the room and knocked on the door, but there was no response. Knowing something was wrong, he managed to pry open the door and saw the man and woman lying supine on the bed, their faces pale and unconscious. There were also paper wrappers of opium next to the pillows, indicating that they had committed suicide by ingesting opium. He immediately reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. Later, the two people who had taken poison were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment in an ambulance. It is said that Yuan Jiazheng was severely poisoned and may be in danger of losing his life, while Fang was less seriously poisoned.</p>

At first, he thought he was a beggar, so he rushed forward to arrest him. Then he found out that he was looking for death. The constable then took him to the police station. According to his statement, his name is Xu Jiafu (transliteration), and he is 18 years old this year. He used to be an apprentice at a grocery store on Chengdu Road. Because he was unbearable hungry, he sought to die quickly. It is said that the young man has now been sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The injuries to his head are not serious.</p>
<p>Economic Oppression Leads to Suicide by Poisoning</p>
<p>Fang Runmin, a 27-year-old man from Songjiang, who lived at 94 Xinling Village, Caishi Road, in the French Concession, recently lost his job due to the impact of the war. He felt even more pressured by his environment and the economy, which caused him to be overstimulated and led him to take his own life. At 4:00 p.m. on the 5th, he went out and bought a certain type of chemical liquid and returned to his residence, swallowed it, and committed suicide. He was found by his friend Ye Jingan, who lived with him, and was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and he died at 8:20 p.m. that night. The hospital reported to the French police station, which sent detectives to investigate and sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall Autopsy Station. Yesterday, a report was made to the Special Second Court, and Prosecutor Shan Wangren went to the station and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died from taking poison during his lifetime. Because his family was still in his hometown, his friend Ye Jingan requested to collect the body on his behalf, place it in a coffin, and transport it back to his hometown for burial. Prosecutor Wang approved it.</p>

Fortunately, a female classmate discovered it and quickly sent her to a nearby hospital for treatment, and she was able to recover.</p>
<h3>The Romantic Swindler Jiang Jianqiu: Exclusively Cheats Rich Concubines and Actresses, Defiling Their Bodies and Swindling Their Possessions; A Detailed Confession of His Adulterous and Deceptive Exploits; Fifteen Confirmed Cases in the French Concession, and the Police are Investigating Additional Theft Cases</h3>
<p>Jiang Jianqiu, a romantic thief from Jiangxi Province, is twenty-five years old this year and has no fixed address. He has been arrested and prosecuted for nearly fifty cases of fraud and theft in the British Concession. Recently, in the Public Concession, he lured a guide girl to open a hotel room. Using fraudulent means, he not only defiled her body but also stole her cash and jewelry while she was asleep and fled. The victim reported to the Public Concession police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Jiang and send him to the First Special District Court for prosecution according to the law. After the trial concluded, Jiang was convicted of</p>
<p>Fraud and Theft,</p>
<p>sentenced to three years' imprisonment for each crime, and a combined sentence of five years. Now, the French Concession police have discovered that Jiang committed similar crimes within the French Concession. Therefore, Detective Sui Wenzhi was dispatched to the First Special District Court to transfer Jiang to the Second Special District Court for interrogation, detention, and further investigation. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. This case has revealed that Jiang is highly skilled in fraudulent and seductive tactics. Most of his victims are rich concubines, such as Zhou Jinxiang and Li Didi, as well as actresses like Mao Jianqiu and recently remarried women like Yu Guifen and Yao Yuchan, and guide girls and</p>
<p>Han Zhuang Prostitutes.</p>
<p>Not only were their bodies defiled, but they also gave him jewelry. The investigation has been concluded, and the defendant is charged with fifteen counts. Yesterday, Judge Qiu from the Second Special District Court continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer for the French Concession administrative authorities, presented the case and prosecuted him for fraud and theft. Subsequently, the investigating officer reported that during the investigation, the defendant confessed to having seduced Zhou Jinxiang, Li Didi, actress Mao Jianqiu, Gan Guifen, Yao Yuchan, etc., in the French Park. On March 18 of this year, he opened a room with Mao Jianqiu at the Dafang Hotel; on March 21, he opened a room with Yu Guifen at the</p>
<p>Da Hu Hotel;</p>
<p>on April 3, he opened a room with Yao Yuchan at the Da Hu Hotel. Mao gave him a diamond ring, a gold bracelet, a gold locket, a watch, and 300 yuan in cash. Yu gave him a diamond ring, a watch, and a coat. Yao gave him a gold watch and 300 yuan in cash. He also successively seduced Xing Sannan, a prostitute from the Hongxiang Yuan Yaoer Brothel, Liu Jindi, a prostitute from Han Zhuang Brothel at 114 Maigao Baolu Road, and Chen Lijun and Chen Cuiyun, female members of the Yang Guifei Guide Agency, for illicit relationships. The defendant also went to Tong Julong Customs Brokerage at 4 Jixiang Street, Jiru Lane, opened by Wang Yanlun, last October, falsely claiming to have come to Shanghai from Tianjin and having no place to stay,</p>
<p>and requested accommodation.</p>
<p>The owner allowed him to stay overnight. The defendant often stole gold watches and cash at night and fled. In August of last year, the defendant went to the Daguangming Hotel on Mofang Street, opened a room, and stayed overnight. That night, he broke into the next room and stole 230 yuan in cash from a guest named Wang Anzhou and fled. After the investigation, the defendant was taken to the victims for identification. However, Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, and Yao Yuchan denied the incidents, but the defendant's accusations were accurate. Five stolen watches were recovered, but the defendant had already sold the remaining stolen goods for his own use and they could not be recovered. The court verified the report and, based on the police's submitted case file, questioned the defendant about each case. The defendant confessed to everything, especially</p>
<p>in vivid detail,</p>
<p>but when asked whether the women's jewelry was stolen by him or voluntarily given, he replied that it was all willingly given by the women and not stolen. Subsequently, plaintiffs Wang Yanlun and Wang Anzhou successively recounted the defendant's fraudulent and thieving exploits. Judge Qiu questioned the defendant repeatedly, and he confessed as before. The court then ordered the case to be prepared for deliberation and announced the conclusion, scheduling the sentencing for the 13th. The defendant was returned to custody. In addition to the fifteen cases mentioned above, Jiang is also suspected of committing many other crimes, such as robbery of gold circle watches, which are currently under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>Qiu Ru's Fraud Case: Transferred to the Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>Qiu Ru (29 years old), from Ningbo, resides at 7 Datong Road.

The case was reported, and he was arrested by the Hongkou police the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the First Special District Court, and the police requested detention and a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Fighting for Power and Profit in Pudong Flower Gambling; Armed Clashes Result in Injuries</h3>
<p>After Li Xiaobao, the Flower Gambling King of Western Shanghai, sent his disciple San Laizi to set up a flower gambling operation in the Yanpu area of Pudong, countless ignorant men and women were drawn into it. The gambling industry flourished no less than in Western Shanghai, and stories of families ruined were common. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, gangsters in the gambling den clashed over business. The conflict arose because San Laizi was monopolizing power. Xiao Baoqun, Xiao Laohu, Qin Daguanzi, Er Suozi, San Suozi, and others wanted to join in and share the profits, but they were unsuccessful. They also set up their own flower gambling operations and sent people to Wujia Nong area to intercept San Laizi's boats. At the time, many thugs were dispatched. San Laizi also gathered people to resist, leading to an armed clash at 1 PM yesterday afternoon. As a result, San Laizi suffered serious head and wrist injuries. One of his henchmen had a finger cut off. Xiao Baoqun had his arm cut off and sought treatment at the Western Pudong Hospital. San Laizi was treated at a pseudo-"hospital." After the incident, the Japanese pseudo-"police" dispatched personnel to maintain order, and a large number of gangsters scattered and fled.</p>
<h3>A Gift Shop on Caishi Road Searched Yesterday</h3>
<p>Around 8 PM last night, two plainclothes Japanese detectives reported to the French Concession Lujiawan General Police Station that anti-Japanese elements were hiding in the Xin Heng Yong Gift Shop at 57 Caishi Road and had printed a large number of anti-Japanese leaflets. After receiving the report, the police chief dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. As a result, no anti-Japanese propaganda was found. Two people were arrested at the scene: Sun Guangyao, 21 years old, from Songjiang, and Liu Zhenying, 25 years old, from Zhenjiang. They were immediately taken into custody. The police are currently investigating the case.</p>
<h3>Bank Employee Embezzles Savings Passbook, Totaling Over Six Thousand Yuan; Reported to Police for Investigation</h3>
<p>Gu Jiayin (26 years old), from Pudong, a personnel department employee at the Xiafei Road China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, is heavily suspected of embezzling 6,289.46 yuan from the bank account of the deceased Wang Chenshi, the beloved concubine of Wang Xinguan, the former manager of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank (resident of Lane 627, No. 14 Kang Nao Tu Road). Wang Chenshi reported this to the Gordon Road police, who arrested him. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, and a request was made for detention and investigation. Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing. The defendant firmly denied embezzling the passbook and withdrawing the money. Wang Chenshi testified in court that she had a total of six passbooks, each with 5,000 yuan, which was a gift from her late husband for living expenses. They were all deposited in the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank. The defendant used to be a servant in my house. My husband saw that he had good character and introduced him to the Xiafei Road branch. He was always trustworthy, so I always asked the defendant to withdraw the interest from the bank for me instead of going myself. Who knew that on this occasion on June 7th, he only returned five of my six passbooks. Because I was dizzy from illness, I didn't look closely. The day before yesterday, I prepared to withdraw the interest again and discovered that one passbook was missing. Upon inquiring with the bank and preparing to post a notice, the bank staff, after reviewing the account books, claimed that the deposit had already been withdrawn with the passbook. Therefore, I suspect that the defendant embezzled it. The court verified the statements and ordered him to be remanded in custody for another hearing in one week.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Forces Eviction, Assaults Tenant</h3>
<p>Wu Xiquan, a lawyer practicing in Shanghai and a native of Yixing, is 30 years old and the cousin of the famous lawyer Wu Kaisheng. He lives at No. 5, Garden Village, Lane 198, Luban Road. He rented a spare room, a four-story attic, to Zhu Jingci (47 years old), from Tongzhou, who works at Dasheng Yarn Factory, on the 11th of last month. The monthly rent is 55 yuan. Zhu paid two months' rent, totaling 110 yuan, when he moved in. Not even a month had passed when Wu Xiquan suddenly told Zhu to terminate the lease, wanting to take back the house for his own use and ordering him to move out by the 5th of this month. Zhu refused to move before the month was up, leading to a verbal argument. At 11 PM that same day, while Zhu was taking a bath in his room, Wu broke into Zhu's room and assaulted him, breaking Zhu's nose and the right side of his head, causing blood to flow profusely. The next day, Zhu reported the assault to the French Concession police. After receiving the report, the police chief sent detectives to investigate and summoned Wu Xiquan for questioning. He was then ordered to be sent to court for prosecution. Yesterday afternoon, Zhu and Wu waited in the spectator section of the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court until the court adjourned without hearing their case. The investigating detective then took Zhu and Wu to the police station to await further processing.</p>

<p>Dr. Huang Zhaoxue, a German-trained doctor whose clinic is located south of the intersection of Chengdu Road and Burkill Road in this city, has recently purchased a lung treatment electrical machine from Germany. This machine was newly invented by Dr. Huang's former professor at the University of Hamburg in Germany. It has not been around for long, and few have been produced. This is the first time it has been shipped to Shanghai. The machine is box-shaped, about four feet tall, and weighs three hundred pounds. It can be used for a new type of treatment for lung diseases such as tuberculosis, eliminating the tedious procedures of injections and medications. If medicines are used in conjunction with the machine and an electric current is connected, it can soon emit a kind of chemical gas and an artificial mountain pine forest fragrance, which purifies the air. After patients inhale it, it can gradually kill the tuberculosis bacteria in their bodies without harming internal organs or muscles. Instead, it can enhance their tissues. After this machine arrived last month, Dr. Huang immediately used it to experiment on patients who came for treatment. It has shown remarkable effects and he is very satisfied, confirming that it can achieve special effects in treating tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Golden Voice Throat Lozenges: These lozenges contain precious red pigment, not only making the mouth fragrant but also preventing seasonal epidemics. They are an essential product for home and travel. Each bottle costs sixty cents, and a special package costs one dollar and twenty cents.</p>
<p>Gospel for the Poor and Sick on the Isolated Island: The summer season has arrived, and diseases are rampant. Dr. Fei Zibin, a knowledgeable doctor, recognizing the plight of the poor and sick on the isolated island who have nowhere to turn, felt deeply sympathetic. Therefore, starting on May 8th, he added a department for diagnosis and medicine distribution at the Menghe Fei's Hospital, located at No. 7 Mingyu Lane, across from the General Association at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Xieqiao, to provide a convenient door for the poor and sick. The hired doctors are all well-known and experienced individuals from Menghe. Currently, with the end of the rainy season and the oppressive heat, diseases such as dysentery and heatstroke are spreading rapidly. Patients are flocking to seek treatment, with the number increasing daily. Those suffering from malaria and dysentery account for half of the patients. Administering Fei's ancestral secret malaria tablets and dysentery tablets has proven remarkably effective in curing the illnesses. The hospital's consultation hours are from 9:00 AM to 3:30 PM, without limiting the number of patients. Those unable to afford medical treatment and medication can adhere to the time and seek treatment.</p>

<h3>Building a "Fortress of Pens"</h3>
<p>— Xinghuo</p>
<p>The literary scene after the outbreak of the War of Resistance showed an unprecedented level of progress: in response to the objective environment and the demands of the times, and following the development of the national united front, past prejudices had been eliminated among literary workers, narrow-minded factional views had been overcome, and there was a realization of the indivisibility of literary work from politics, economics, society... and other departments. They took on the sacred task of the War of Resistance and the mission of soldiers in the literary field; for two years, the light and hope that permeated the ongoing War of Resistance further diluted the residual individualism among literary workers, and under the supreme principle of "everything serves the War of Resistance," our forces were concentrated. However, precisely because the era we are in is so great and at the same time so turbulent, we cannot help but feel the insignificance of individual strength and that what we can contribute to the motherland is too limited. Faced with the current reality, we have an even greater need to strengthen collective power.</p>
<p>After entering the new stage of preparing for a counteroffensive, the tasks of the War of Resistance and our central mission should undoubtedly be the consolidation of organization and the strengthening of combat effectiveness. There is a very close connection between these two tasks: only by unleashing collective power can literary work achieve greater success in the future. The current question is only one: how to integrate our individual strengths into a collective force, and then organically coordinate with the forces of other departments, to barely accomplish the arduous task of resisting the war and building the country.</p>
<p>In the current stage, literary workers, as cultural fighters, should also prevail with organic and dynamic tactics, just like the soldiers on the front lines; on the one hand, we should widely use the method of "breaking up the whole into parts" to unleash our firepower, but at the same time, we cannot ignore the preparation for "integrating the parts into a whole" at any time. In order to strengthen the collective power, our literary workers should concentrate the pens in their hands and build a "fortress of pens." Here, the author would like to make an appeal to comrades in the literary world, hoping that in the near future, from call to action, literary workers across the country will unite to build a strong "pen formation" as our spiritual fortress!</p>
<p>The current literary scene is showing the dawn of organization and unity: one is the development of the literary communication movement, showing how a new form full of combativeness is being accepted and promoted with enthusiasm by the broad masses; the other is the unfolding of "article charity sales," which universally expresses the sincerity of literary workers on the "isolated island" towards the motherland. Because of these two points, the author feels that the establishment of a "fortress of pens" will definitely not be just an empty slogan, but will definitely receive a wide response and then be put into practice.</p>
<p>In January of this year, Mr. Ying Fuqun, after reviewing the overall achievements of the Shanghai literary scene in the past year, pointed out: "Not using literary work to unite and tap the power of the literary world is a major mistake of literary activists in the past year." (See the Shanghai Literary Scene in the Past Year in the 12th and 13th issues of the Lesson Report Weekly) Now, half of the new year has passed. Looking back on the past, we feel that our efforts are not enough to overcome past mistakes; however, we will never be discouraged, we should place our hopes on the next half year, and wish the literary world to add infinite brilliance to the next half year with the performance of collective power!</p>
<h3>Daydream</h3>
<p>— Xu Qing</p>
<p>"Do you understand anger?"</p>
<p>A friend once said this to me. From his smile, I could see his perseverance. His rough face seemed to have been tempered by wind and frost, and it was tinged with purple Xin patterns, although he was very young.</p>
<p>Soon, that friend quietly left. That was three years ago.</p>
<p>Now, I understand anger, but I am still mute, locked in my attic room, letting depression and烦恼 torment me, living a life like in the desert.</p>
<p>When the high temperature descends upon my room, I habitually close my eyes, fantasize, and dream.</p>
<p>In the haze, a voice raps on my table:</p>
<p>"Is this a land of ease? Daydreaming all day long!"</p>
<p>I am startled and open my bloodshot eyes. This visitor's whiskers are knotted like an arhat's, and beneath his wide eyebrows, two very familiar eyes are flashing.</p>
<p>"Now, you should understand what anger is all about!" He smiles lightly, and this smile immediately makes me blush. Ah, he is back.</p>
<p>"Indeed, anger is like a torch, and it will burn even more fiercely in a storm. When ordinary people try to suppress your anger, you will become even more angry. How can you be so young and yet have no fire at all? Ha! How have you grown old?"</p>
<p>"Then what about you? You must..."</p>
<p>"Me! I understand anger, I made an attempt at anger!" Before I could ask a question, he shouted loudly. He rolled up his sleeves, revealing two arms, which were covered in charred scars, with some places having new scars, the new flesh glowing a frightening red.</p>
<p>"Because I understand anger, I cannot endure it. I roared and roared, I fought in the field. But I was arrested. In the middle of the night, they used iron bars heated red by the furnace to brand my arms, they severely flogged my body. I gritted my teeth, without a word of complaint or a plea, because I understand anger! They said I was a demon who could not be roasted to death, but I finally fell! I sacrificed myself!"</p>
<p>My heart burned like fire, and a chill ran down my skin:</p>
<p>"Then you are now a ghost?"</p>
<p>"Who says I'm not! A ghost is more precious than the flesh. The flesh can be destroyed, but the ghost is eternal. It comes and goes freely and can sneak into everyone's heart!"</p>
<p>After saying this, the visitor went to the window. I was dripping with sweat inside the room. I couldn't help but laugh to myself:</p>
<p>"I'm daydreaming!"</p>
<p>I woke up! Have I woken up? And yet, this dream! Is this a dream?</p>
<h3>Wish</h3>
<p>— Ren Linrui</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>It was getting dark, and we boarded the last ferry. The boat was crowded with people: those going to the market, selling vegetables, doing small business, and pulling rickshaws, many laborers. The boat rocked, the creaking of the oars mingled with the chatter of the people, and the setting sun shone dimly on the muddy Yellow River.</p>
<p>We arrived at the pier. Looking back at the opposite bank, there were still clusters of figures wriggling, the crowds left behind on that side by the last ferry, who had to pay a higher price to call for small ferries.</p>
<p>Following the villagers, we walked onto the small stone road. "Look! Isn't that the train station?" Old Lu muttered to himself. I looked in the direction he was pointing. The lights were already on there. Blown by the wind, the lights flickered and shone brightly.</p>
<p>Several comrades were already waiting at the station. I went forward and introduced Old Lu to them. After exchanging greetings, more than a dozen of us boarded a car and put a few luggage bags in the carriage, as if unloading a thousand-pound burden. Then we relaxed and focused on discussing the development of the war situation.</p>
<p>When the train started, the black curtain had covered the land. Only the sound of the engine broke through the cold night. In the turning of the engine, we could faintly see the red lights of the villages.</p>
<p>The train wheels and rails collided and roared, as if welcoming our advance, like singing a battle song of freedom.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, our carriage was the first one behind the locomotive. Discovering this, we immediately opened the glass window, watching the engine workers sending coal into the engine furnace, the tongue of fire looking out unobstructed. Seeing the fire in the dark night was like a dead life leaping back into the struggle of man. Everyone was leaning on their faces, although the coal smoke still swept in front of us from time to time.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour, we reached our destination. The regiment headquarters sent two armed comrades to pick us up, one of whom was the short-sighted Old Xu.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Arriving at the regiment headquarters' resident office in the Lin family ancestral hall, in the dark room, I felt for the old berth, shook the straw, and put the black military blanket on it. The scattered things were piled on top.</p>
<p>Old Lu was unfamiliar with everything here. I told him that we were serving in the army: we went to the countryside for propaganda during the day, helped the garrison stand guard at night, and also organized a rescue team to assist the Red Cross rescue team to be dispatched at any time, and sometimes sent a few comrades to escort military equipment...</p>
<p>...... ......</p>
<p>Experience told me that this was the 7:00 PM dinner call, so I interrupted the conversation and pulled Old Lu out.</p>
<p>"Comrades, before going to the dining room, I want to report a happy thing," the company commander reported in front of more than forty comrades: "This is what every comrade asks for every day, that is, the division headquarters stationed here wants us to send twenty people to serve on the front line, the task is propaganda, military uniforms are supplied by the division headquarters, and an allowance is issued separately. This is a very good opportunity, but it requires a common examination. Those who are willing can sign up immediately, and everyone will be convened at the original place at 8:00 PM after dinner. It is best for everyone to be over the age of eighteen." He raised the last three words of eighteen years old particularly loudly.</p>
<p>A burst of enthusiastic commotion broke out immediately, everyone shouted that they were going, and the result was that no one didn't go, although some were under the age of eighteen, and so was I.</p>
<p>But everyone seemed to have no heart to eat dinner, eating two bites in one, some painfully burned their tongues on the porridge, but never complained. They ate quickly and quickly came out of the dining room. Three or five gathered in a pile, all talking about how to achieve their wishes. I also talked to Old Lu about how to deal with this enlistment test. Everyone showed wrinkles on their worried faces under the light of the clear yellow oil lamp, and were anxious about whether they could be selected to go to the front line.</p>
<p>The autumn wind was a bit cool, and the stars were shining.</p>
<p>Eight o'clock was right, knocking on everyone's heart, our wills were united.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>We remembered that the division headquarters was not here yesterday, and began to praise the speed of the division headquarters' movement.</p>
<p>There were several tables pieced together in the hall, with a lamp covered with mulberry paper on top.</p>
<p>There was no sound at all. The director of the division headquarters' office was a solemn, tall man. Under the dim light, he carefully checked our names, and one by one passed by to be tested. Some comrades were standing, he taught them to sit down, and said not to panic, especially when being tested.</p>
<p>He asked for the name, age, birthplace, and asked which of the four subjects of Guoying Arithmetic History and Geography you were best at.</p>
<p>Everyone had a smile on their faces, calmly answering all the questions. Some comrades even said extra-curricular wills, saying that there were still several older brothers and sisters at home, so it didn't matter if they sacrificed, they were all enthusiastic, and everyone enthusiastically hoped to reach the front line, and no one wanted to fall behind.</p>
<p>Finally, he asked me:</p>
<p>"How old are you?"</p>
<p>"Sixteen years old."</p>
<p>"Which subject are you best at?"</p>
<p>"History and Geography."</p>
<p>"Where is the South Manchurian Railway, where is the starting point and ending point..."</p>
<p>It was already ten o'clock, and the eight armed comrades on duty, with light-hearted hearts and heavy steps, went out on patrol first.</p>
<h3>We Want to Turn the Universe Around</h3>
<p>— Written by Ni Jixiang</p>
<h3>A Bundle of Weeds</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Hope</p>
<p>If life can be compared to walking, then I would say that there is always a spark of light ahead, or perhaps a lighthouse, close and yet distant, that you can never quite catch up to.</p>
<p>Action is not blind but conscious—except for fools. When shooting a gun, you must aim at the target, and when advancing, you must have a goal first. The light of hope is precisely the magic wand that leads people forward. We live, we pursue.</p>
<p>Too many fantasies float on the innocent child's heart; when we are children, we learn to weave dreams. But that is always a mass of darkness, like a soap bubble blown from a small mouth, in an instant, it breaks and shatters. Hope is not fantasy, not a dream; it is guidance, it is a call, it is light.</p>
<p>Reason</p>
<p>Who has had this kind of experience? Face flushed, with an agitated heart, touching east and west with trembling hands, but unable to do anything, finally falling onto the bed, burying a gray face.</p>
<p>The torrent of emotions washes away the peace of mind, in the day, in the night, especially on quiet afternoons and moonlit nights. I mean when you are alone.</p>
<p>Quickly build your dam of reason to prevent the flooding of emotional rivers. If life is a difficult learning process, then the difficulty lies in not being able to build the dam of reason.</p>
<h3>Red Devil Vasika</h3>
<p>— Written by Gorky, translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>"Where is the money?..."</p>
<p>She went mad with fear.</p>
<p>This happened in the winter. The next morning, Vina, barefoot and in a single shirt, was brought out of the bathroom and walked home in the deep snow. She smiled quietly and said in a happy voice:</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, I will go to church with Mommy... go to church again—to pray..." When Sarah saw Vina in this embarrassing situation, she whispered in front of everyone, timidly:</p>
<p>"But I didn't steal the money..."</p>
<p>It is difficult to talk about anything else in relation to Vasika, except for trembling in front of him and hating him.</p>
<p>They all seduced him, surrounded him, and were determined to be his mistress. At the same time, they all hoped that their "trusted" confidant and guest would kill Vasika. However, he had terrifying strength and never got drunk; it was not easy to do him in. Countless times, poison was sprinkled in his food and drink; and sometimes, although it was successfully calculated, he completely recovered, and he knew all the conspiracies against him with astonishment. However, among countless enemies, he did not care much about the risky methods that touched his cold and cruel heart towards prostitutes. He always said coldly:</p>
<p>"If there is a chance, you may bite me to pieces with your teeth, I know that!... But don't look for trouble now!... I'm not afraid of anything!..." Saying that, he protruded his thick lips, looked at everyone's faces, and laughed through his nose—probably laughing at them.</p>
<p>He and the police officers in the area and the plainclothes police officers often visited brothels and developed a common front. But he had no friends among them, nor did he want an confidant. He had more contact with the others, and he treated everyone with the same indifference.</p>
<p>He drank beer with them and talked about the criminal cases that occurred in the area every night. If no one asked him to beat the prostitutes, or to "scare them" as they said in that place, then he would stay at home and go nowhere.</p>
<p>The house where he was on duty belonged to a part of the house on the right, collecting entrance fees from guests—three rubles during the day and five rubles at night.</p>
<p>The procuress, Figura Airu Malevana, was a fat woman, almost fifty years old, foolish and malicious; she was very afraid of Vasika and regarded him as a treasure. In addition to room and board every month—the bedroom was a tomb-like narrow attic—she gave him fifteen rubles. Her family benefited from Vasika, and the girls maintained exemplary order. All eleven of them were as tame as lambs.</p>
<p>Figura Airu Malevana spoke to the guests with a self-congratulatory mood, and often boasted about the girls in her store like a sow and a cow. (Three)</p>
<h3>(I) On Cherishing Time (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>(1) When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you should think about is God's blessing during the night, or to do some things to serve God. When you go to sleep at night, you should also thank God for the day's grace, and ask God to give you a good night's sleep, and not to be greedy for sleep. (2) Everyone should be diligent in their duties and should not waste time and lose their job without reason. (3) When you have free time, you should meditate and do good deeds that benefit others. "Making friends" is also an important thing. (4) Holidays or Saturday afternoons and Sundays should not be considered days of leisure. There should be plans to do things that are beneficial to the body and mind and benefit others. (5) Do not make friends with gamblers and people who have nothing to do. (6) Do not chat idly with others for the sake of entertainment. (7) Older people should not do things that younger people do. (8) What we do should not only be commensurate with our age, but also commensurate with our identity and status. Some people hold important positions, but do lowly and insignificant things, such as King Nero, who went back and forth on the streets of Greece all day long, competing with zither players for superiority. (9) The things we do should be measured against Christian moral standards. (10) No matter who it is, they should not be too particular about clothing and food, so as not to waste time and lose their job. (11) We should get rid of unnecessary curiosity. (12) Unnecessary social engagements should be rejected as much as possible. (13) Entertainment should be chosen that is upright and beneficial to the body and mind. (14) Do not be lazy in doing things for God. (Sir Moore, once making a report with a group of believers, suddenly the king ordered him to go to him. At that time, he replied that he would first serve the King of Kings (ie, Jesus), and then serve the king.) — Shanghai Christian Literature Evangelism Association, PO Box 1227</p>

<h3>Trends of Christian Universities: Three Major Points of School Management Policy: Cooperating for Economic Courses</h3>
<p>There are a total of thirteen Christian universities in China, now distributed in Pinghu, Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, Yunnan and other places. The presidents or deans of these thirteen schools (Yenching University, Soochow University, Shanghai University, Zhijiang University, St. John's University, Fukien Christian University, South China, Lingnan, Central China, Jinling University, Ginling College, Cheeloo University, West China Union University) met in Hong Kong from April 17 to 22, and resolved 33 cases in five major categories: economy, administration, curriculum, policy, and religion. Among them, the five most important things are now notified to the schools by the relevant parties for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the policy of running schools, the universities deeply believe that at this time, the three elements of Christian personality, freedom of teaching, and loyalty to the country should be upheld at all costs.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding future cooperation, the current national crisis has given the schools many opportunities for cooperation. The current conference hopes to have further cooperation. The conference suggests that schools in coastal areas and schools in inland areas should become two groups, respectively studying the social needs of their locations, planning how to divide labor and cooperate, so as to contribute to the construction of a new China through Christian education.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the curriculum, the universities deeply feel that the curriculum set by the Ministry of Education should best focus on the minimum required courses and give the schools flexibility. The conference also hopes that the government can allow Christian universities to continue their colleges or departments of education, and as for the fifth year of teacher training, it is hoped that several schools in the region can jointly run it.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the economy, in this difficult period, temporary subsidies are indispensable. However, these funds are best used for jointly run undertakings to achieve the effect of competence and cooperation.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the issue of staff, because of the increase in affairs, in addition to Comrade Ge Deji, another Chinese comrade should be hired. For this reason, a small committee will be elected to specialize in finding this talent in order to realize this plan as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Children's Welfare Association - Establishing a Beggar Children's Training Institute</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association attaches great importance to the education of poor children. The first phase of its work plan is to establish a beggar children's training institute.

<h3>The Necessity of Replenishing Kidney Deficiency and Brain Weakness in Summer</h3>
<p>The gardenia blossoms, the heart is anxious, asking what love is, the anger burns?</p>
<p>Yesterday, someone called and said: "Suffering from kidney deficiency, with brain weakness, recently, because of the hot weather, the symptoms have worsened, but summer replenishment may not be very suitable, I wonder if there are any other better methods?" The erroneous idea that summer is not suitable for replenishment is probably prevalent in the minds of the general public! Indeed, in summer, because the weather is hot, people's digestive power is weaker, and nourishing materials with a lot of fish, meat, and rich fats are indeed more difficult to absorb and hinder the stomach and intestines. But other than that, what's wrong with nutrients that are easier to digest? Moreover, when the symptoms worsen in summer, just like those who are hungry eat, and those who are thirsty drink, replenishment is the same.</p>
<p>There are many who talk about the emergence of kidney deficiency, but most of them are caused by masturbation and spermatorrhea in their early years, or the extravagant and excessive indulgence after marriage, which consumes too much of the reproductive gland fluid (semen). This not only destroys the external reproductive organs, but also depletes the secretions of the reproductive glands. Then, metabolism is reduced, the development function stagnates, and the nerves of the brain, spinal cord, and sex organs show weakness. Therefore, symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and scattered energy will follow one after another. However, in this sensual summer, after a fragrant bath, under the flowers and moon, when facing the lover, it is inevitable that one cannot help oneself, and it cannot be said that it is excessive for a loving couple to have sexual intercourse once or twice a month. However, if the husband has the above-mentioned symptoms, then even if he encounters joy, he will not be able to be happy, how can this not arouse his wife's hatred and burn with anger? At the same time, kidney deficiency is often accompanied by brain weakness. Then, in this summer, endless symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, poor memory, slow thinking, depressed ambition, insomnia, dreaminess, haggard appearance, back pain, and physical fatigue are more than enough. This kind of man is not only a sinner in love, but also becomes a [illegible] in society. Others will have a bright future, but he will be in a sea of sorrow and suffering every day!</p>
<p>Patients with kidney deficiency and brain weakness are indeed very annoying and dangerous, but in today's era of medical advancement, treatment is not difficult. According to the thousands of medical records of world-renowned doctors, and my practical experience over the past ten years, it is believed that the use of the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin" is the most effective and specific for the symptoms. This agent is scientifically replicated from the reproductive gland hormones extracted from the bodies of strong animals such as apes, gorillas, sea dogs, bears, and deer. Therefore, the quality is precious and the effect is great, which is far beyond the reach of other similar preparations. After taking this agent, the patient will start to feel the effect of the medicine within one hour, and within 24 hours, it can produce sperm, replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuing to take it for half a month can also help growth and development, adjust metabolism, and long-term use can achieve the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating youth, and reversing aging. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemit's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" (available in Wuzhou Chinese and Western Pharmaceutical Companies) to consolidate the sperm gate and stop leakage. Then, treating both the symptoms and the root cause, the effect will be even more rapid!</p>
<h3>Effective Remedies for Nocturnal Emission in Summer</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>The causes, pathology, and dangers of neglected nocturnal emission have been repeatedly discussed in the previous two issues of this publication. But why does nocturnal emission worsen in the summer? Are there any effective remedies? Because of the urgent demands of most patients, we will discuss it again: In summer, due to the hot weather, the internal forces generated in the body need to be reduced, but the internal forces inevitably continue to be produced, so there is a need to release them, followed by the discharge of sweat, and the tissues become relaxed, including the sperm duct that controls the opening and closing of the seminal vesicles. At the same time, due to the bare chests and legs of men and women, there are more carnal stimuli. Therefore, for all these reasons, those suffering from nocturnal emission are prone to have their symptoms worsen, and the frequency of ejaculation increases. In addition, insomnia due to the hot nights affects neurasthenia, with some experiencing ejaculation even without nocturnal emission, and others already suffering from nocturnal emission developing spermatorrhea or sperm leakage! Spermatorrhea refers to the involuntary loss of semen during sleep without dreams, while sperm leakage refers to the seepage of a small amount of semen even during the day when seeing attractive women, overusing the brain, or during bowel movements. This is the most frightening symptom of nocturnal emission. If treatment is delayed, it will inevitably lead to depletion of essence and blood, brain and kidney deficiency, so that even with a beautiful wife, one cannot enjoy a happy life, and even with good career opportunities, one cannot perform satisfactorily. This life is like falling into hell, even leading to premature aging and death, with an unimaginable future!</p>
<p>The summer treatment for nocturnal emission must start from consolidating the sperm duct, calming the nerves, ensuring restful sleep, and reducing dreams. Taking "Hemet's Sperm Consolidation Pills" fully serves this function. Therefore, famous Chinese and foreign doctors all recognize this remedy as the most effective treatment for nocturnal emission. The number of cured cases is no less than tens of millions. However, those with weak brains and kidney deficiency should also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys and increase essence and blood, thus treating both the symptoms and the root cause, with even faster results. If patients can come to our clinic for electrotherapy injections and other methods, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>The Breasts Are the Key to Female Beauty</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Aside from the antiquated old men who wear copper-rimmed spectacles, I think all men value healthy and beautiful women, especially those with high, firm breasts and plump buttocks, right? Because healthy and beautiful women with high, firm breasts and plump buttocks not only have a posture with obvious curves and rich fleshiness that attracts men and fills them with admiration, but also have abundant secretions from the gonadal ovaries, vigorous metabolism, and thus a gentle and considerate personality, clear and detailed understanding, white and moist muscles, and cheeks like spring flowers, always showing a bright smile. Such women are like the treasures of society and the fairies of the world. As virgins, they are loved and pursued by everyone. Once married, because of their exceptional physique and temperament, the love between husband and wife is naturally very strong, forming a happy family and giving birth to clever children. Their happiness is truly limitless. However, in the past, if breast binding, self-debasement, menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, postpartum weakness, or serious illnesses damaged the ovarian function and affected metabolism, not only will they lose their captivating beauty, but they will also be disliked by men, with no happiness at all! The only remedy is to immediately take the gonadal ovarian secretion preparation for women, "Germinal Hormone," which can nourish ovarian function, stimulate metabolism, regulate menstruation, eliminate uterine diseases, and promote reproductive function overnight. Continued use will not only make the shriveled breasts gradually become high and firm, and the thin buttocks gradually become plump, but also make the haggard cheeks become delicate and charming, enhancing beauty.</p>

<h3>Gonorrhea Destroys Reproductive Tissue</h3>
<p>Gonorrhea is a condition with a rapid rate of proliferation and high destructive power, so those who suffer from gonorrhea regard it as a great burden for the rest of their lives. Moreover, its destruction invariably affects the tissues of the reproductive organs, such as prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, vas deferens inflammation, and orchitis, all of which can dreadfully destroy reproductive function. Therefore, infertility due to gonorrhea accounts for 80-90%, which is a matter that every patient with leukorrhea must pay attention to. It is advisable to carefully investigate the symptoms and accurately determine which symptoms belong to gonorrhea. Therefore, the medical equipment for diagnosis must be complete, such as urethroscopes, cystoscopes, high-power microscopes, and microscope slides, all of which are indispensable. A clear diagnosis is like reconnaissance in war, determining the enemy's strength and weaknesses and their hiding place. Once these situations are clear, then you can win by surprise, capturing the enemy. The treatment of gonorrhea is the same. First, use scientific methods to diagnose the location of the disease, and then use scientific methods to thoroughly cure it. Thus, even the most stubborn and difficult-to-treat leukorrhea is not to be feared! For all kinds of reproductive-tissue-destroying leukorrhea, German Hiss Serum can penetrate deeply into tissues to kill bacteria and enhance the body's ability to resist gonorrhea toxins. Its efficacy is superior to all other serums and pigment injections and can replace all surgery. On the other hand, the latest invention of Dr. Loechner of Germany, Lymph Filtration and Smoothing Electrotherapy, involves inserting a probe into the urethra, so that even stubborn gonococci can hardly resist this penetrating electricity, thus further enhancing the bactericidal effect of Hiss Serum. It can also filter out toxins produced by gonococci. Therefore, lymph filtration electrotherapy is the most advanced electrotherapy and is unparalleled. It has been adopted by major venereal disease hospitals in the West. All kinds of gonorrhea toxins that destroy reproductive tissue can be cured in a short period of time and guaranteed to restore reproductive capacity.</p>

<h3>Finance - Foreign Banks Restrict Foreign Exchange Swaps - July Futures Resale Surges - Spot Swaps Become Tighter - Difficult to Arouse Arbitrage Interest</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listed price, remained unchanged. Although the underground market had the Bank of Japan absorbing and foreign firms settling accounts, the supply of foreign commercial banks was abundant, resulting in the British rate being flat and the US rate slightly firm. July futures were quite loose and excessive. Because major foreign commercial banks witnessed the general shortage of cash in the black market and the manipulation of futures by Chinese and Western speculators with no real strength, they urgently exerted pressure and severely restricted multilateral swaps. As a result, the multilateral side was panicked. Chinese banks, Sassoon, and smaller foreign commercial banks competed to sell. In addition, foreign firms with surplus positions in July also came back to sell, causing the British gold price to ease to six and a half pence and the US exchange rate to once firm to twelve yuan sixty-two and a half cents. Later, with the help of Tianjin businesses taking advantage of the low prices, the situation softened slightly. Thus, the spot rate and the end-of-month swap became tighter. Currently, the swap rate for British gold is only 1.25, and the US exchange rate is only 25, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of about 2.4% excluding commissions, while arbitrageurs actually only get a little over 1.5% (calculated for 25 days). However, at the above interest rate, it is feared that arbitrageurs will hardly be interested in the current period of cash shortage. Spot trading is thin, and July futures are quite active. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, because foreign banks' selling interest remained strong, it finally rose again by 1.25.</p>
<p>Futures Market Situation Eases Greatly</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London big bars, the near-term rate rose by 1.25, the far-term rate was flat, New York silver prices did not change, London raw gold was still flat, and the exchange rates for British against US and against Shanghai were unchanged, while against French was 0.0625. Central's listed prices for various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 6.5625 pence for the British rate and 12.78125 yuan for the US rate, both unchanged from the previous day. After opening, although foreign firms were picking up, and the Bank of Japan was also absorbing British gold, the supply of British and American banks was still strong, so there was no change. The Bank of Japan and foreign firms successively picked up HSBC, Hua Bi, and Yuli spot British gold at 6.5625 pence. Subsequently, foreign firms also bought the settlement of a certain bank's spot US exchange rate at 12.78125 yuan. When HSBC's listed price was announced, there was still no increase or decrease. When the silver balance tax was announced to remain exempt, due to the fact that Chinese banks came to sell again and foreign firms' appetite was sluggish, and the selling intention was good, the market continued to ease and firm. Chinese banks, Dongya, etc., and foreign banks Hua Bi competed to fill the Bank of Japan and Chinese merchants' July British gold from 6.40625 pence, firming to 4375. Subsequently, foreign firms, Holland, sold July US exchange rate to Yuli at twelve and a half yuan. Later, Sassoon and the Bank of England HSBC also started competing to sell July US exchange rate, making the market even firmer. Sassoon and HSBC successively sold July US exchange rate to American banks at 12.53125 and 5625. Later, foreign firms also came back to sell July long positions, making the situation even firmer. Foreign firms sold July British gold to foreign banks at six and a half pence, and the same month's US exchange rate at 12.625 yuan. Near noon, foreign banks did interbank trading, with spot US exchange rate at 12.8125 yuan. At that time, the Hong Kong exchange rate was also slightly firm, and foreign firms had supply intentions for the spot price of 44.375 yuan. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 6.5625 pence for British gold and 12.8125 yuan for US exchange rate (most foreign firms may find it difficult to settle the above US exchange rate purchase price).</p>
<p>Tianjin Business Purchases Still Strong</p>
<p>In the after-market, although Chinese banks continued to close out July futures, foreign firms, Yuli, on behalf of Tianjin businesses, had a very strong buying appetite, so the situation softened slightly. Chinese banks sold July British gold to Yuli at 6.4375 pence, and the same month's US exchange rate at 12.5625 yuan. After entering, foreign firms sold spot US exchange rate to the Bank of Japan (broker transfer) at 12.8125 yuan, which seemed slightly firm. At that time, the spot price of the Hong Kong exchange rate was still 44.375 yuan. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 6.5625 pence for British gold and 12.125 yuan for US exchange rate (most foreign firms may find it difficult to settle the US exchange rate purchase price). The bank's selling prices for July were 6.4375 pence for British gold and 12.5625 yuan for US exchange rate. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot British rate was flat, the US rate continued to rise by 0.03125, the July British rate firmed by 0.0625, the US rate fell by 0.125, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also rose by 0.125 according to the bank's selling price. The day's opening transaction records are listed below:</p>

<h3>Although Foreign Exchange Futures Are Firm, Cash Is Moving Towards a Peak - Hong Kong Businesses Compete to Enter - Supply Is Exceeded by Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cash black market situation, although the internal market for July continued to firm, operators disregarded it, and the market gradually strengthened. Because Tianjin businesses' selling intentions were not very strong, and the purchase of goods by South China and Hong Kong businesses continued uninterrupted, the intention of retail investors to sell weakened sharply, resulting in frequent demand exceeding supply. The market price then moved towards a peak, finally closing at the day's highest peak of 2,576 yuan. As a result, the rate rose by 16 yuan, with very few retreats along the way. Trading was average, with only about 700 taels for the whole day. Silver jewelry also increased by 2 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained fixed as before.</p>
<p>Spot Cash Black Market Rises by 16 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, although securities businesses had strong selling intentions at the initial opening, because Hong Kong businesses entrusted a certain money exchange business and a certain silver shop to frequently absorb purchases, the market situation was extremely stable. A securities business sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business, priced at 2,560 yuan, with no gain or loss compared to the previous closing. A certain silver shop absorbed 50 taels from the money exchange business, priced at 62 yuan, and then increased by one yuan slightly. Gold shops did interbank trading of 50 taels, priced at 63 yuan. Then a certain silver shop also entered 100 taels from the securities business, priced at 62 yuan. At that time, a certain silver number also started buying, and the potential became firmer, entering 50 taels from the securities business, and the price was raised by 3 yuan to 65 yuan. Shortly after, the silver number immediately resold 50 taels to the money exchange business at the original price, with the price being the same. Later, it fell slightly by one yuan, and a certain broker sold 50 taels to the money exchange business, priced at 64 yuan. After this, there was a period of silence in the market, and it became firmer again near noon, with a money exchange business recovering its profits and reselling 50 taels to a certain silver shop at 66 yuan for the noon closing price. The initial opening in the afternoon was still flat, and the first transaction was the money exchange business entering 50 taels from the cash gold shop at the price of 66 yuan. Later, the market was silent for a long time. After 2:30, a certain gold shop again bought heavily on behalf of South China businesses, and sellers were extremely scarce, so the rise suddenly became fierce. In an instant, it rose by 4 yuan, and a certain gold shop entered 50 taels from the money exchange business, priced at 70 yuan. At that time, the buying trend was still strong, and it was raised by another 6 yuan. A certain gold shop entered 50 taels from the silver shop business, priced at 76 yuan. After this, buyers still had an appetite, but sellers were hesitant, so it was difficult to make a deal. Therefore, the evening closing was still 2,576 yuan. As a result, the rate rose by 16 yuan compared to the previous day, with fluctuations of 16 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold shop's local gold was 2,585 yuan, and the purchasing price was 2,570 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Increases by 2 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silver jewelry per tael initially remained unchanged. At 12:20, due to the firm potential of spot cash, it also increased by one yuan. After 3:30, it increased by another one yuan. It is estimated that the major counterparts changed the price to 261 yuan, and the new counterparts to 259 yuan, with a purchasing price of 253 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Still</p>
<p>A London cable on the 5th stated that due to the stability of the British pound, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 and a half pence per ounce. Therefore, the market prices of various central banks remained unchanged. The Chinese cash purchasing price was 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao, the listed customs gold was 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li, and the Shanghai standard gold price was 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>

<h3>A Ray of Hope for the Black Exchange Market - Restricting Swaps for August Futures, Leaving July Futures Alone - Will There Only Be Spot Trading Thereafter? - Depends on Whether Reality Can Follow This Course</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram restricted cash deposits and withdrawals, this newspaper has expressed its approval of the principle, but without remedies for the legitimate needs of industry and commerce and new measures for foreign exchange, even if the black exchange rate falls to one penny, someone can still profit. However, if we want to have a solution for foreign exchange, we must obtain powerful sympathetic help from abroad. Since we have seen British Members of Parliament repeatedly questioning whether to maintain China's legal tender, especially on the 4th of this month, Finance Minister Simon replied to the Member's inquiry by saying:</p>
<p>"For the interests of Britain itself, and for the interests of other countries that have economic and financial relations with China, the stability of China's legal tender is valued by the government. Moreover, it is important to note that the stability of China's legal tender is of great importance, as I have said. However, I am not yet able to announce what measures we will take in the future."</p>
<p>From this, we can see that Britain will eventually take a path to maintain the exchange rate of China's legal tender after it has fallen by 25%. However, if we adopt an unrestricted and unbridled black exchange market, we will inevitably repeat the past mistakes. On the one hand, no matter what the price, we will still operate on futures. General speculators can also turn to futures to manipulate, and the exchange market will not be controlled. Yesterday, local foreign banks with a large scope, in view of this, suddenly restricted swaps for August futures, while July could still be traded as usual. However, if the July rate wants to be swapped for the August rate, apart from small-scale foreign banks that are still allowed to swap within a possible scope, all others are rejected. Currently, most of the deposits of general speculators are deposited in larger foreign banks, and small-scale foreign banks are also bound by cash, so there is no way to manipulate. This move puts great pressure on speculators, and the multilateral side has to reluctantly cut losses. This is indeed a powerful way to maintain China's legal tender. If it can be fully realized, then in the future, foreign exchange will only have spot and no futures. Spot requires cash. As long as the cash is tightened, the activity of spot foreign exchange will be limited. Perhaps the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange will gradually shift to Chinese banks. Let's wait and see what happens.</p>
<h3>Indian Silver Plunges 11 Annas - Forward Rate Also Continues to Fall - Big Bars Turn Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>A London cable on the 5th stated that the silver market had both Indian and speculative traders entering and exiting, and those who entered were content. The market was calm, and after closing, it was flat and sluggish. Near-term supply was lacking, and India bought forward rates at the listed price. For big bars, the near-term rate rose by 1.25, and the forward rate remained unchanged. A New York silver cable stated that the US spot price remained at the original price. Another Bombay silver cable stated that the Indian silver market was weak, and spot and July plunged by 11 annas, and August also continued to fall by 8 annas. A total of 50 transaction orders were placed.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Lowers by 2.5 Yuan - Call Loan Rate Still at 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and notes turned lower. It had initially risen to 100 yuan per thousand, but soon fell to 95 yuan, and in the afternoon, it could not be sustained and retreated to 92.5 yuan, which was 2.5 yuan lower than the previous day. As for the Money Industry Association's call loan rate, it remained at 2 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Notes Recover</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. Foreign exchange shops in this port were still settling accounts eagerly, and foreign banks' supply was smooth. The selling of the US exchange rate was even more prevalent. The market situation was flat for the British rate and firm for the US rate. The British rate remained at 6.5625 pence, and the US rate was 12.8125 yuan, which was 0.03125 lower than the previous day. The opening of spot cash was stable at 2,560 yuan. Later, the market was quite firm due to the strong buying interest of gold shops' clients. The noon closing was 66 yuan. In the afternoon, retail money exchange businesses absorbed purchases even more eagerly, and the supply was scarce. The market price was high and firm, and there was no return. General speculators, seeing that the European situation was armed peace and conflict could be avoided, were quite excited. The evening closing was 2,576 yuan, which was 16 yuan higher than the previous day. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were firm in the market due to the high rise in spot cash. British and American gold notes were in high demand, and market prices rose. Foreign exchange was flat for the British rate and loose for the US rate. Today, foreign currencies are rising, and wealthy individuals are collecting them, without being slightly affected by the restrictions on deposits and withdrawals. Hong Kong, French, and Annam notes are all in demand and are rising. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes were fairly balanced, and changes were minimal. The evening market was 9 jiao, 9 fen, and 3 li. Korean notes were sluggish at 8 jiao, 7 fen, and 2 li. There were few transactions in the association. Hongchang issued Taixin British gold notes for 50 pounds, and Yongtai issued British gold notes for 20 pounds. Yesterday's market prices were up 4 jiao for British gold pounds, up 5 fen for British gold notes, up 2 jiao for American gold pounds, up 2 fen and 5 li for American gold notes, up 5 li for Hong Kong notes, up 1 li and 2 hao and half for French notes, and up 2 fen each for Singapore and Annam notes. All other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Securities - Government Bonds Rise Irresistibly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities black market situation continued to rise sharply and was quite vigorous. Since the market opened, it has risen for three consecutive days, with a total recovery of more than three yuan to six yuan and one jiao. If we calculate from the lowest to the highest, it has recovered nearly nine yuan. The retreat was sharp, and the advance was fast, which is logically appropriate. The key lies in whether the principal and interest will be settled. Currently, the market is rumored to say that changes in the settlement of principal and interest are not a problem, but general frightened birds, for the sake of caution, still doubt whether there is an official written announcement. Therefore, the market still has no shortage of sellers. At the initial opening yesterday, there was a sharp rise of one yuan, and Tiensheng, Lianhe, Defu, Xieda, Runli and other firms continued to search for purchases. Short covering and long positions arose for a time, and the market price soared. Xieda had a very strong appetite for Class A, and in an instant, it rushed out of the 60 yuan mark and continued to 61 yuan. Class B also reached 51 yuan, and Class C was approaching the 50 yuan mark. The excessive rise was not in line with the environmental situation, which caused the release of long positions. Songmao and Xingyuan were quite eager to sell, and many retail investors also sold out. Soon, it returned to the 60 yuan mark. It is inevitable that there will be a big rise and a small retreat, and the environmental situation must be complemented. There is not much hope for long positions in the future, and short covering may not be very urgent, so there may be a return. The resulting market price continued to rise by 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and a half to 2 yuan and 1 jiao. The total number of transactions was about 700,000 yuan. The market is closed today, and a brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Maximum Minimum Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Class A 61.20 59.00 60.10 Up 2.10</p>
<p>Class B 51.20 50.80 51.00 Up 1.60</p>
<p>Class C 49.80 48.70 49.60 Up 1.55</p>
<p>Class D 48.80 48.40 48.80 Up 1.75</p>
<p>Class E 49.40 48.50 49.15 Up 1.55</p>
<p>In the stock market, 50 shares of Nanyang Tobacco were traded at 8 yuan and 2 jiao. The Public Industry Association reported that the stock market continued to be very sluggish yesterday. Although there were buyers offering low prices, sellers were scarce. Jardine shares were stable at about 18 yuan and a half. There was still demand for tram shares at 39 yuan and a half. The rubber stock market was very neglected, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>The London Chinese Foreign Debt Market on the 5th of this month (Friday) only had a few fluctuations. British-German, continued British-French, and Sino-French American gold all fell by one pound. The former was 47 pounds, and the latter was 45 pounds. Only Shanhai British-French rose by half a pound, and the price was 33 and a half pounds. The rest remained unchanged. The buying and selling market was 33 pounds and 5 shillings for Shanhai British-French, and 27 pounds and 5 shillings for German-French with stamps. On the previous day, 2,000 pounds of Shanhai British-French were traded, with an opening price of 32 pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence, with a slight reduction of 2 shillings and 6 pence as a market maker. On this day, real goods were offered for sale: 2,500 pounds of Shanhai British gold, with a selling price of 33 and a half pounds, on par with the market, and 2,000 pounds of French-French with stamps, with a selling price of 30 and a half pounds, which was 3 pounds lower than the British-French.</p>
<p>The London British Far East Companies' Stock Market on the 5th of this month (Wednesday) only saw HSBC Bank's British registered shares rise by half a pound, and the price was 79 and a half pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Capital Tightness and Sluggish Sales, Cotton Yarn Prices Plummet Further</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and because the price drops are not speculative opportunities, transactions are difficult to develop. At the same time, the discount rate for banknotes is high, leading to sluggish sales. In addition, traffic on all routes is obstructed and transportation is not smooth, resulting in a picture of decline in the market. However, the goods hoarded by wealthy individuals remain untouched. The market relies on 20-count Double Horse brand foreign yarn to barely maintain, breaking the 480 yuan mark.</p>
<p>The current situation of yarn: At the opening of the market this morning, dealers still tried to maintain it, opening the price at a small two yuan. 20-count Double Horse was at 483 yuan, with 30 bales transacted. The warehouse price was 478 yuan. Customers only inquired and explored. Soon, due to the lack of buyers, the price drops resumed. Double Horse brand foreign yarn gradually fell to 478 yuan, but actual business remained ordinary. Later, a certain dealer slightly bought in a few bales, showing a slight improvement of one or two yuan. The closing price for 20-count Double Horse was 479.5 yuan, and the warehouse price was 475.5 yuan. It is found that all dealers bought a total of 775 bales throughout the day. As for prices: 10-count Double Horse fell 5.5 yuan, Double Globe fell 4.5 yuan, Shepherd fell 5 yuan, and 20-count coarse yarn fell 1.2 yuan and so on. It is found that 300 pieces of cotton yarn arrived yesterday from Ningbo. The amount bought by each dealer is listed below:</p>
<p>Dealers: 535 Yunnan: 60</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 165 Mainland: 15</p>
<p>Total: 775</p>
<p>The yarn market suddenly declined today, with a very weak trend, mainly due to the lack of actual sales and the tightness of capital. These are the two reasons for the sluggish yarn market. The spot price of 20-count Moon Lute yarn is currently 393 yuan, a drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Transactions: Gradual Improvement, Occasional Orders for Foreign Cotton with Talk of Full Payment Upon Ordering</h3>
<p>As for the market price of foreign cotton: In the New York cotton market, prices rose slightly by one or two points in the morning due to dealer purchases and short covering, and the telegrams from Bombay and Liverpool were also favorable. Although Washington has already decided on agricultural relief funds and cotton export subsidies have also been determined, they have not been officially announced, so details cannot be ascertained. Therefore, dealers have turned to a wait-and-see attitude. The weather report from the cotton region is good, and the new cotton is growing well. Dealers predict that this year's new cotton will reach 12 million bales. Therefore, yesterday New York fell three or four points. India, including forecasts, rose by more than one rupee. Egypt rose by more than 20 points.</p>
<p>Transactions in foreign cotton in Shanghai are becoming increasingly quiet. Although various parties have a strong need for cotton, it is difficult to raise funds, so they can only wait and see for the time being. Foreign firms are making new transactions, but because the current market price is too high and the risk is too great, they require full payment upon ordering. However, there are currently no new negotiations, so this statement cannot be confirmed. In short, it will be very difficult to make new transactions in the future.</p>
<p>Local cotton transactions are gradually improving, but the amount of transactions is still small. Although dealers are readily buying in, most of it is transferred to other factories for delivery. Chinese factories have not yet started to buy. There is talk that a certain factory in Qingdao is acting as an agent for shipping foreign cotton. The cotton market situation has been slightly dampened by the sluggish yarn market. The supply from northern Jiangsu only brought 101 bales of Tongzhou cotton, and 484 pieces came from Beisha. The current prices for finished cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Changshu Mozi: 86.00 Dealers buying in: 497 bales Banknote warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Dazhong Jimei Seed: 105.00 Dealers buying in: 1,000 dan Banknote warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Bai Luoqu: 90.00 Dealers buying in: 200 pieces Banknote warehouse delivery</p>
<h3>Grain: Flour Quiet, New Wheat Still Has Few Transactions</h3>
<p>The current flour market is as quiet as usual. Sales from both northern and southern dealers remain poor due to the Tianjin situation and cash problems. Although there are rumors in the market of negotiations for wholesale customer sales, no agreement has actually been reached, as factories are also unwilling to make too many concessions to sell off their stock. Overall market transactions rely only on the local street, with a transaction volume of only 6,000 to 7,000 bags. No. 2 flour remains at 4.65 yuan in cash. The market is still barely maintaining.</p>
<p>The supply of new wheat is continuous, but because various producing areas are occasionally closed off, it cannot flow smoothly, so the amount of goods arriving is not large. Those holding the goods are all holding firm and waiting for an opportunity. Yesterday, the local street hoarders continued to inquire, and Japanese merchants and Japanese factories have also started to purchase, but with the weak flour sales, they all intend to suppress the price and take advantage of it, while the owners are unwilling to sell cheaply. As a result, there were still no transactions between the two parties.</p>
<h3>Thick and Thin Japonica Rice Unchanged, Reduced by Two or Three Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of goods from various dealers, Hexia still had no arrivals. Nine cars of Che Lun arrived at Fengjing, totaling 1,100 to 1,200 bags. Although the goods arriving were limited, the sales were also ordinary. Mainland dealers did not buy, and the local street shops showed a downturn, causing the market to return to a state of fatigue. However, sellers' minds are still firm and they are holding on hard, so the price of thick and thin japonica rice did not fluctuate much. However, the Su Tong dealer Rongjia was quite willing to sell, so the price dropped a few cents. Du Yang and Jianbu's sales were also not smooth, showing a flat and tired appearance. The local street only sells special grades of customer-specific rice, and the medium and lower grades are sluggish because mainland dealers have not bought them, and show a soft appearance, occasionally reducing the price by a few cents. Although Bian Yuan has not arrived for a long time, the inventory is still abundant, and there is also foreign glutinous rice competing with it. At this time of decline, the market is becoming more tired. Tuan Li Hong Kong glutinous rice is only offered at 19.8 yuan, and Jian Li is offered at 19 yuan, all of which are two or three cents lower than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Foreign and Customer Indica Rice Both Fall</h3>
<p>Customer Indica: Yesterday, mainland dealers' appetite decreased sharply, and rural villages and the local street were also mostly waiting and watching. Wholesalers and hoarders rarely inquired. The reason is that the capital has been extraordinarily tight recently, legal tender is scarce, and due to martial law in various places and the hot weather, it is not easy to store for a long time, so the sales volume is even smaller. The total market transaction did not exceed 2,000 bags, and the price was immediately pressed down by one or two cents.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday, affected by the drop in the price of local customer indica rice, sales also became sluggish. The total market allocated and opened more than 100 bags of Saigon rice at 23 yuan, which was also a small drop of one and a half cents compared to the previous market. It is also said that a new No. 1 Saigon rice of 600 tons was traded at a price of 21 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oilcake: The Rise of Soybean Cake is Like a Flash in the Pan, Soybean Oil is Sold at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>The soybean cake market situation, on Tuesday (June 4th), once fluctuated, and the price increase was quite strong, but the sales inevitably stagnated, resulting in a bearish atmosphere in the past two days. Yesterday, 3,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cake were traded at a price of 3.02 to 3.03 yuan, and 4,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand cake were traded at a price of 3.015 to 3.03 yuan. Most of the sales were still in the mainland.</p>
<p>Because of the abundance of soybean oil arrivals and inventory, people's minds are tired, and a portion of the basket-packed oil, after arriving, is still stored outdoors due to the lack of space in the warehouse. The owners are very eager to sell, and have to reduce prices, so the market price has fallen by eight or nine cents. Peanut oil was flat first and then rose. It is estimated that 150 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were transacted at prices of 33 yuan and 33.5 yuan. Soybean oil transacted 400 pieces of Jiaozhou at 32 yuan, 200 pieces of Yanqi at 32.7 yuan, 200 pieces of Qingqi at 32.4 yuan, and 10 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were transacted at 45.5 yuan. Because the market is closed for one day today, the market was slightly tight at the close yesterday.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Green Tea Inventory Insufficient, Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, green tea dealers were not in a hurry to purchase various factory-made green teas because European mail ships were departing today, so their interest was slightly weaker. However, the market inventory is low, and the supply from Wen and Yong roads has been cut off, so people's minds are still firm. The whole city is estimated to have bought a total of more than 370 boxes of Chou Xin Zhen Mei and other goods from Xiehe, Jinlong, Baolong, Tongfu and other firms. The top grade of Chou Xin was traded at 345 yuan, and the total Zhen was traded at 278 yuan. The price was not much different from the previous one. It is found that 104 pieces of tea leaves arrived from Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Red Soars, National Sugar Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, the Joint Operations Office opened 5,000 bags of Dutch red for re-export, with the allocation price at 16 yuan. This was a sudden increase of one yuan before, and it was immediately opened up, which was very popular, because it is expected that the market will continue to rise in the future. No. 24 coarse sugar was offered at 29.7 yuan in the local warehouse and 29.5 yuan in the foreign warehouse. Re-export was 21.3 yuan, with 300 bags transacted. Dutch red spot was 21.6 yuan, local No. 1 white was 29.5 yuan, No. 2 white was 29 yuan, Tai B Mark West warehouse was 30.025 yuan, East warehouse was 30.05 yuan, CW was 20 bags, CX was 29.7 yuan, DY was 29.2 yuan, HX was 29 yuan, H red was 20.05 yuan, local No. 1 ice was 35.5 yuan, and Jingming ice was 37 yuan. It is found that there is no change in Hong Kong Dutch electricity, but London electricity for August is small 75, which is 8 pence 175, December is up 25, which is 6 pence 75, and March is up 25, which is 6 pence 25. The national sugar situation is also tightening. It is estimated that the Chao Gang opened several hundred bags of Gaozhang Diaoqing at 17.5 yuan, and the Jian Gang opened 150 bags of Tiqing at 19 yuan to 18.9 yuan, and 117 bags of second-class Nanjiang Qing soft坯 at 16 yuan, and 89 bags of Tongzhou red at 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Statistics: June 1939 Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department's gazette, the Shanghai workers' cost of living index for June of this year is as follows: Since the war, the cost of living index for workers in this city has gradually increased. This month's index has reached a new peak. In the past seven months, it has risen continuously and is increasing day by day. In January of this year, it increased by 4.17 points, February by 1.63 points, March by 1.96 points, April by 0.99 points, May by 8.62 points, and this month it increased by 11.28 points. This month's index is 176.15, an increase of 6.84% compared to last month, an increase of 15.48% compared to the same month last year, and an increase of 76.15% compared to the pre-war index in 1936. The reciprocal of this month's index is 56.77, so the purchasing power of one yuan of national currency this month is equivalent to 5 jiao 6 fen 7 7 of the national currency in 1936 before the war.</p>
<p>Compared with last month, the classified index for this month increased by 10.94% for food, 6.03% for miscellaneous items, 3.82% for fuel, and decreased by 4.21% for clothing. (To be continued)</p>

<p>National Medicine and Diet</p>
<p>Typhoid Fever Special</p>
<p>Recently, typhoid fever is prevalent. The extent of its spread has not been seen in Shanghai for many years. Therefore, this issue is compiled as a "Typhoid Fever Special" for our readers. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Typhoid Fever Dietary Restrictions</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zuosan</p>
<p>During the course of an illness, patients generally need to "avoid certain foods." Especially in the early stages of a febrile disease, when the appetite has not changed, special attention should be paid. If this is boldly ignored and one indulges in eating and drinking, it can most easily worsen the illness. According to the "Treatise on Febrile Diseases," after the first formula, Guizhi Tang (Cinnamon Decoction), it is written: "Avoid raw and cold, glutinous and slippery, meat, noodles, the five pungent spices, wine, cheese, and foul-smelling things." Now I will try to interpret them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Raw and Cold, Glutinous and Slippery: Febrile diseases with surface symptoms and fever are signs of the body's temperature reflecting to resist external cold. The body's work focuses and trends outwards. An empty stomach and intestines and internal peace are necessary to expel evil outwards. If at this time one mistakenly eats raw and cold foods, the stomach will be stimulated by cold, or glutinous and slippery greasy things will suppress the middle burner. The stomach will have difficulty digesting, and the body's work will rise to rescue, collapsing the outer perimeter and turning inward. Thus, the surface and interior combine with evil and sink inward.</p>
<p>(2) Meat and Cheese: These two things are rich in fat. When fat enters the body, it produces heat, and the body temperature will increase and cannot be released, so the heat becomes excessive. Moreover, greasy products are more difficult for the stomach and intestines to digest and absorb, and are prone to cause Yangming accumulation.</p>
<p>(3) The Five Pungent Spices, Foul-Smelling: The five pungent spices, such as garlic chives, etc., all have a special heavy and turbid smell, which is easy to stimulate the stomach wall and cause nausea. Although their nature is mild, warm, and turbid, they do not reach those who have already transformed heat from a febrile disease.</p>
<p>(4) Noodles and Wine: Noodles cause gas and are difficult to digest, and they contain alkaline substances. Wine is yin in nature but yang in function. Initially, it excites and increases heat, but then it becomes damp and turbid in the middle, easily turning into phlegm and heat, which increases the illness.</p>
<h3>After Typhoid Fever</h3>
<p>— Wu Shanqing</p>
<p>In the early stages of recovering from typhoid fever, the most important issue is recuperation, and the way to recuperate is to control the diet as a matter of urgency. This disease's crux is that the stomach and intestines are the focus of the disease. If the digestive function has not recovered, it is often due to accumulation and steaming, and due to steaming and re-heating. Therefore, during the course of typhoid fever, one should endure hunger and thirst. Even when the disease is receding, one should be cautious and prevent problems before they arise. One must wait until the fever has subsided, the body is cool, the pulse is harmonious, and the tongue coating is clean before one can eat a little to nourish the stomach qi. If there is residual heat, the pulse is still not harmonious, and the tongue coating is dry and scorched, or even has thorns, this is because the stomach heat has not been removed. One can only drink boiled water. Even if one wants to eat, one cannot suddenly advance. Eating too much too early will inevitably lead to food recurrence.</p>
<p>When one first wants to eat after recovery, it is better to eat frequently and in small amounts. First advance clear porridge, then thick porridge, and then gradually advance thin porridge. Do not eat arbitrarily and in large quantities to prevent accumulation. As for sweet and delicious foods, and all meat dishes, one must wait until one has passed hard stool and the bowel movements are smooth and regular before one can gradually advance, and one must not be greedy and eat without moderation. Add radish soup and dried vegetable soup to help dredge the intestines and harmonize the stomach. When thirsty, one can drink fine sprout tea. When hungry, one can brew boiled water with eggs, or beef juice or chicken juice. For those who are strong, one can use bird's nest to cook porridge to nourish the lungs and nourish yin. For those who are weak, one can use mung beans to cook porridge or Job's tears to cook porridge to help clear and detoxify.</p>
<h3>Not Avoiding Meat After Typhoid Fever</h3>
<p>— Jin Zheming</p>
<p>Most patients can adhere to the conditions of "avoiding certain foods" when treating typhoid fever. Of course, large amounts of fish, shrimp, crabs, etc. are rejected, and even small amounts of meat floss are not often eaten. In fact, they have not thoroughly understood the true meaning of "avoiding certain foods after illness." The so-called "avoiding certain foods" is not not allowing one to eat things, but it is implying and urging patients to carefully select suitable foods, and not to eat indiscriminately or eat to excess without restraint. There is also a kind of "avoiding certain foods" after typhoid fever, which is not about avoiding meat and fish, but not overeating many indigestible vegetarian dishes. One must know that if one eats pickled cabbage, sweet pickled cucumbers, and toon heads, if one does not spit out the residue, these kinds of vegetarian dishes not only do not have rich nutrients, but are also extremely difficult to digest, and the illness is very easy to relapse. In fact, chicken soup, chicken juice, beef soup, and beef juice, although they are meat, can indeed compensate for the depleted physical strength and nutrition. Many people often gain weight after eating chicken juice and beef juice after illness. One must know that all solid foods are prohibited, and all liquid things, whether meat or vegetarian, are not to be feared. To be sure, "the avoidance of certain foods after typhoid fever does not lie in the difference between meat and vegetarian, but in the problem of solid and liquid."</p>
<h3>Treatment of White Bumps in Damp-Warm Typhoid Fever</h3>
<p>— You Xuezhou</p>
<p>The reasons why damp-warm typhoid fever causes white bumps are not the same. Some say that dampness should be cleared and drained, but if the treatment is not proper, it will be suppressed between the chest and diaphragm, and steamed by heat, like the brewing of koji, turning into white bumps. If one uses the method of light quenching early, allowing the dampness to come out from the urine, the white bumps will naturally have nowhere to occur. Some say that in the beginning of the disease, one does not use antipyretic and sweat-inducing drugs to relieve the surface, so the dampness is contained within, with no way to pass, and it turns into white bumps, still reaching out from the skin. However, the location of the white bumps is mostly on the chest and neck, and occasionally on the lower abdomen. As for the head, face, and limbs, it can be said that they are extremely rare. If it is said that the early treatment is not proper, then the impact should definitely not be limited to the trunk. This theory is not without doubt.</p>
<p>There is also a newer theory that the occurrence of white bumps must be related to the lymph nodes. The liquid contained in the white bumps is lymph fluid, not the "dampness" of the inflammatory secretions usually referred to. Although lymph nodes can be seen everywhere in the body, the place where the lymph fluid meets the blood is the subclavian vein in the chest. If it is affected by pathology and an obstruction occurs at the meeting place, it will permeate outward and become white bumps. Anyone who has white bumps must have chest stuffiness and fullness, which is why. Although the theory is attractive, it has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>After the occurrence of white bumps, the pathological changes are quite inconsistent. Those with milder symptoms gradually have their fever subside and their body feels safe. Those with more severe symptoms, even though white bumps appear, the course of the disease does not change. As for those who become critically ill as soon as they see white bumps, it is also seen from time to time. The general understanding is that it is a good sign for damp-warm typhoid fever to develop white bumps. Once the white bumps come out, the disease is smooth and the opportunity is reached, and it can turn danger into safety. Therefore, the presence or absence of white bumps is used to determine the benefits and harms of the disease. This is a big mistake. Only when the disease changes to a lighter state after the white bumps come out is it a good sign. If the disease does not change, or becomes heavier, the symptoms must be very lingering. The point of attention in the diagnosis is how the condition changes after the white bumps have erupted, not whether the white bumps erupt or not.</p>
<p>As for the use of medicine for white bumps, some advocate rushing to nourish yang, but in reality it is not necessarily the case. It is still appropriate to treat according to the symptoms, so the method of conditioning should also be adapted to the situation. First, the room should not be too stuffy and the clothes and bedding should not be too warm, so as not to hinder the excretion of the skin and the release of body temperature. For those with fullness in the chest and ribs, the buttons under the collar can be loosened to make them comfortable. The protection method for white bumps is slightly different from that for measles, etc. For those with high fever, it is not necessary to carefully hide them in a secret place. Seeking coolness is also harmless. If the white bumps appear and the disease does not change, food is still prohibited. If the fever gradually decreases and is indeed moving towards a better state, it can be gradually changed from porridge soup to thin porridge, and then to rice. The side dishes can also be gradually changed from vegetarian dishes to meat dishes. As for beverages, orange juice is the best. Other things such as reed root soup, Artemisia annua dew, and honeysuckle dew have the effect of transforming dampness and clearing heat, and can all be used.</p>
<p>White bumps that are full, blooming, shiny, and like crystal are the best. Although the symptoms are severe, the vital energy is not weakened, and the resistance is still very sufficient. If the conditioning is proper, it is not difficult to restore health. Those that are dry, dark, and dull indicate that the vital energy is greatly deficient. Even if the heat has decreased, it is lingering and difficult to fully recover for a while. Those who turn to a state of deficiency and damage are often seen. Quietness is the most important thing. If the appetite has not decreased, it may be helpful to advance some nourishing fluids to replenish the body's vitality. There are also those who bloom in the evening and then shrink, and then bloom again in the morning, repeatedly. Especially when they should be allowed to sleep peacefully, do not talk to them too much and tire their spirits, and do not let them sit up and tire their strength. If they are young children, the caregivers can sleep with them to get full rest, then the white bumps must be full, blooming, and moist, and once they are collected, they will not recur.</p>
<h3>Oranges</h3>
<p>— Chen Cang</p>
<p>Oranges are good fruits for autumn and winter. The ones produced in Guangdong are the best in our country. The whole fruit can be used to treat diseases. A brief description is as follows:</p>
<p>Pulp: It is warm in nature, sweet and sour in taste, and has the functions of moisturizing the lungs, relieving cough, removing chest congestion, and helping digestion. Making juice with honey and mixing it into a spoonful is even sweeter and more delicious. Drinking it for those with constipation has the effect of moisturizing the intestines and promoting bowel movements. Orange juice can be drunk during typhoid fever.</p>
<p>Peel: The one produced in Guangdong is called Guangpi (Guangdong peel), or Xinhui peel; the one produced in Fujian is called Bridge peel. The dried and aged ones are good, so they are also called Chenpi (aged peel). It is bitter and spicy in taste and warm in nature. It mainly promotes qi, strengthens the stomach, removes dampness, and resolves phlegm. It treats nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, and stomach upset, and is an essential medicine for promoting unblocking. If you remove the white part from the orange peel, it is called orange red, which treats coughs from external pathogens, benefits qi, eliminates phlegm, and has the effect of penetrating and emitting. If you remove the red and leave the white, it is called orange white, which also has the advantages of fragrance and stomach harmony.</p>
<p>Collateral: It invigorates blood, benefits qi, and unblocks the collaterals. Decoction and drinking can treat thirst and vomiting wine.</p>
<p>Kernel: Treats small intestine hernia and swelling and pain of the testicles, but the effect is very small.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, orange leaves are also used in medicine. It has the functions of reducing swelling and dissipating toxins, and is often used for liver qi disease.</p>
<h3>Loquat and Sugarcane</h3>
<p>— Zou Demin</p>
<p>Loquat is a tree, more than ten feet tall, with long oval leaves, very fine teeth, and brown hair on the back, very dense. The fruit ripens in early summer, is round in shape, yellow in color, sweet and sour in taste, and has fine hairs on the skin. The one produced in Bai Sha, Dongting, is the best, with a lighter color, sweet and delicious taste, and less sour taste. There are also red and large ones, called Dahongpao, which are still palatable. Loquat leaves have the function of treating coughs, resolving phlegm, clearing heat, and moisturizing the lungs. Pharmacies take it to make ointment, and steam the leaves to make dew to treat coughs, but when using the leaves, the hairs must be brushed off, otherwise it can cause coughs. Loquat ointment is not very suitable for coughs at the beginning of a cold, but if you eat it for a slightly longer cough, it still has a small effect, and it is also a beneficial fruit.</p>
<p>Sugarcane is a fruit. There are Guangdong products on the market. A kind produced in Tangxi is cool and moist in nature, with purple skin and short stalks. The juice is less and the taste is lighter. They are all raw materials for making sugar. It is a wonderful product for clearing heat, promoting body fluids, and moistening dryness. It can also open the large and small intestines and promote urination. For those suffering from typhoid fever and warm disease, when the heat evil burns internally, deprives the body fluids, and the stomach and intestines lose moisture, and the tongue is dry and green, sugarcane juice is listed as an essential medicine. However, it must be the purple-skinned one to be good. Unfortunately, there are not many sources of purple-skinned ones, unlike the green-skinned ones that flood the market, so it is a pity that it is more difficult to purchase.</p>
<h3>Radish</h3>
<p>— Zou Demin</p>
<p>Radish is a kind of vegetable, with long and round shapes and red and white colors. The fruit that bears in the spring is small. It is called Yanghua radish, take it and soak it in sugar and vinegar, add sesame sauce and oil to mix it for eating, it is fragrant and suitable. The raw food is spicy and sweet, and the cooked food has no spicy taste. Common people mostly regard it as a side dish, but how can we know that it is also very effective in medicine. I will enumerate it as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Cough: For those suffering from coughs that do not heal for a long time and have no chills or fever, mash the radish to make juice, combine it with maltose, or add a little coltsfoot flower to stew and take. Radish contains volatiles, which can relieve coughs, resolve phlegm, widen the middle, and lower qi. Maltose and coltsfoot flowers are also moisturizing the lungs and harmonizing the middle. If you take it several times as directed, you can easily see results.</p>
<p>(2) Sore throat: If phlegm and heat block the throat and cause swelling and pain, decoct radish with green fruit (olive), called Qinglong Baihu Tang (Green Dragon White Tiger Decoction), and take it to dispel wind, resolve phlegm, clear heat, and detoxify. Also, dry and brew the radish leaves (that is, the vegetable leaves at one end of the radish) into tea, which can help treat all throat diseases.</p>
<p>(3) Resolving phlegm: Heat diseases often cause phlegm that diffuses throughout the chest, diaphragm, lungs, and stomach, causing cough, wheezing, phlegm, and even coma. The medicine must be bamboo sap, bezoar, fritillary bulb, and polygala to clear, resolve, and open up. If you add radish juice to the medicine and take it together, the effect is greatly improved.</p>
<p>The Earth Skull sold in pharmacies, which has the function of venting the lungs and resolving phlegm, is dried radish. Also, people often say that radish can relieve the medicinal properties, and regard it as a forbidden thing during the period of taking medicine. Raw food can cause burping, and eating too much can cause food retention. It is feared that it will vent qi when taking medicine and reduce the potency of the tonic", so it is right not to eat it, but ordinary medicines have no effect on relieving the medicine. Cooked food not only does not relieve the medicinal properties, but also harmonizes the stomach and reduces turbidity, and helps digestion. Eating it when the weather is dry can also prevent throat diseases. Its seeds are called radish seeds, which are sold in pharmacies and are a wonderful product for resolving phlegm and eliminating food.</p>
<p>Little Notes on Food Nourishment</p>
<h3>White Honey Steamed Fresh Lotus Root</h3>
<p>— Xu Gengyan</p>
<p>Take a section of large, fat fresh lotus root, wash it, cut off one end, pour true white honey into the lotus root hole until it is full, then take the cut section and cover it with toothpicks, and place it in the rice pot to steam three times. Feeding it to those suffering from hematemesis can nourish the body and replenish blood. If you can use lotus root joints to decoct soup instead of tea, it will be even easier to see results.</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>Thank you, Ye Nong, Zhang Ruwei, Xu Jintao, Lin, Fouming, Xu Linyan, Zhang Zanchen, Jin Zhensheng, Zhu Zuosan, Zou Demin, Zhang Huailin, Dong Shuliu, Zhang Luo, Chen Jiazhen, Ren Lide, You, Nazi, Yang Yanhe, Jiang Jianchu, Jin Zheming, Li Cikai, gentlemen, your May manuscript fees have been settled, please bring the receipt with the seal to the accounting department of this museum to collect it (National Medicine and Diet Editorial Department)</p>
<h3>Constipation Treatment Methods</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zuosan</p>
<p>Habitual constipation is more common among women. This is because women's blood easily becomes deficient, leading to a deficiency of bodily fluids, which fails to provide moisture, resulting in constipation. Thus, blood deficiency is the root cause. Therefore, for treatments based on spleen and blood deficiency causing dryness and constipation, use Yixue Runchang Pills; for dryness and depletion of bodily fluids, use Congrong Pills or Wuren Pills; for weakness, use Maren Pills; for wind-induced constipation, use Huomaren Pills; for fire-induced constipation, use Gengyi Pills; for failure of turbid yin to descend, use Tongyou Tang. Many established formulas use Qingjiang Tongda medicines such as rhubarb, yuli, and aloe to irritate the intestinal tract and increase peristalsis. In addition, it is essential to include blood-nourishing and moisturizing ingredients such as hemp seed, angelica, and cistanche to increase the secretion of intestinal glands, lubricating the intestinal lumen and its contents for smooth passage.</p>
<p>External treatment methods are specifically for addressing the large intestine, utilizing their moisturizing and descending properties without weakening the stomach. Zhang Zhongjing prescribed two methods: honey suppository and pig bile enema. The former is similar to today's glycerin suppositories, while the latter is similar to soapy water enemas. Furthermore, those suffering from constipation should pay attention to their daily diet. Vegetables such as cabbage, radish, and spinach are rich in various nutrients and fiber, which help increase intestinal peristalsis. Fruits such as oranges, bananas, and pears are rich in fluids that moisturize the intestines and also contain various vitamins that can be beneficial. Therefore, they should be eaten regularly. Spicy condiments, such as ginger and pepper, can easily cause fire and increase dryness, so it is best to avoid them. (Cunren notes that the pills and honey suppositories mentioned in the manuscript are available at Chinese medicine stores.)</p>

<h3>Refining the Naval Forces</h3>
<p>China plans to purchase a ready-made ironclad ship from England for around 900,000 taels of silver. Although this ship may not be the best in Europe, it can still be considered a powerful vessel. It is expected to arrive in China in about two months. However, having such a vessel requires having people who know how to use it, which is truly China's difficulty. Among all the countries in the world, England is the most renowned for its naval strength. Russia, Prussia, Austria, and other Eastern countries all send people to study there. Why doesn't our country follow their example? Now, there is a training center for the naval forces in Fuzhou, which is certainly an excellent method. Currently, the navigators on our warships are merely people from foreign merchant ships and Chinese sailors who have worked on merchant ships. Although they can navigate along the coast, few can calculate the sun's position, understand the stars, or have a thorough understanding of navigation methods. Therefore, it is difficult to venture into the open ocean with them! Furthermore, being familiar with the regulations of merchant ships does not mean they understand the structure of warships. Therefore, one cannot assume that just because naval officers and soldiers are able to transport officials and goods along the coast during peacetime, they will be effective in wartime.</p>
<h3>The Zongli Yamen Uses Movable Type</h3>
<p>The Zongli Yamen (Foreign Affairs Office) has recently established a Western-style printing house, which includes four sets of large type and two sets of small type, as well as various sizes of lead movable type. They are currently printing "A Chronicle of the Suppression of the Taiping Rebels," with a total of 220 copies, and 50 or 60 copies have already been printed. After this, they will continue to print "Records of the Suppression of the Muslim Rebellion," which will also be a large number of copies. Now that the capital has this excellent printing method, why not use it to publish the daily court gazette?</p>
<h3>Trains Transport Weapons to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The other day, a steamship named "Erson" arrived in Shanghai. This ship belongs to the renowned arms manufacturer "Geweber." In addition to commercial goods, it was carrying many Gewerber cannons and other weapons.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Teachers During the Summer Break: Two Months of Unemployment</h3>
<p>— Luo Er</p>
<p>Hoping that the meager "salary" will still be paid as usual</p>
<p>And that it should be increased next semester</p>
<p>Whenever I meet these friends, they jokingly say to me, "It's summer vacation! Haha! You have two months of rest!" When I hear my friends say that, I always put on a forced smile, but in my heart, I feel an unspeakable bitterness. I would reply, "Yes, yes, our school has started its summer vacation."</p>
<p>Indeed, as my friend said, will I have two months of rest during the summer vacation? In fact, not at all. For me, this poor elementary school teacher, the two-month "summer vacation" is just a beautiful euphemism for "unemployment"!</p>
<p>In society, the status of elementary school teachers is slightly better than that of fortune tellers, as my sympathetic colleagues and I often say. After Shanghai became an "isolated island," the so-called "education sector" in Shanghai went from "panic" to "prosperity." Logically, we elementary school teachers should be able to live more comfortably and be more confident. But the reality is, again, not so!</p>
<p>During the Shanghai War and shortly after the retreat of the National Army, the so-called "education sector" in Shanghai was in extreme "panic." Readers must still remember seeing pitiful posters on the walls that read, "Economical elementary school: one dollar per month." At that time, the principals of most elementary schools were so miserable that people couldn't help but feel sympathy for them. As for the elementary school teachers, at that time, as long as they had food and lodging, they were content and at peace.</p>
<p>However, this "panic" gradually "prospered" along with the abnormal development of the "isolated island" society. Elementary school principals transformed into "darlings of fortune." But we elementary school teachers remained the same. Working like dogs and monkeys, busy from morning till night, sixteen silver dollars a month was already considered a "佼佼" (outstanding) among elementary school teachers!</p>
<p>Of course, we are envious of the principals' meteoric rise. We have asked the principals to increase our so-called "salary" by one or two dollars, but we were met with indifference and scorn. Of course, we dare not mention such things again. We are well aware that the "industrial reserve army" of "elementary school teachers" is watching for an opportunity in this "isolated island," where the unemployed are everywhere.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Shanghai is increasing day by day, and our "real wages" are decreasing instead. Sixteen silver dollars is now equivalent to about ten yuan. It's okay for a bachelor like me, but I have some colleagues who have wives and children, or parents at home. How can they survive on a "real wage" of about ten yuan in Shanghai, where the cost of living is so high? Readers, just close your eyes and think about us elementary school teachers. Isn't our life too much like that of cattle and horses?</p>
<p>Now, our school has started its summer vacation. The vacation is two months long, and there is no "salary" during these two months. How dare we ask the principal? It is already our great fortune to be hired next semester. How dare we make extravagant "demands"?</p>
<p>I remember the principal encouraging us, "Work hard during this extraordinary summer vacation. Didn't the German elementary school teachers show their great strength during World War I?"</p>
<p>Although society despises us elementary school teachers, we always remember our duty.</p>
<p>But we can't just because of that, not support ourselves and our families.</p>
<p>Precisely because our duty is great, now that the principal's school is developing rapidly due to the abnormal development of the "isolated island," shouldn't he give us elementary school teachers reasonable treatment through "unity and mutual assistance"?</p>
<p>Although summer vacation has already begun, I appeal to all the elementary school principals in Shanghai to help the workers who work like dogs and monkeys for you. During the summer vacation, continue to pay the pitifully meager "salary," and starting next semester, their "salary" should be appropriately increased!</p>
<h3>The Story of Alexander Graham Bell</h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>“The Story of Alexander Graham Bell”</p>
<p>A 20th Century Fox Production, Showing at the Guo Theater</p>
<p>This film was made in memory of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. Its significance is clear: it encourages this generation to devote themselves to invention. Bell's story teaches us a great lesson. When he invented the telephone, he faced many difficulties and hardships, but he persevered and endured until he succeeded. This applies to other endeavors as well. As long as the work benefits society, and one is willing to work hard, there is no reason why one should not succeed.</p>
<p>Why make a film commemorating an 1873 scientist now?</p>
<p>As I ran out of the theater, I had such an association: The world situation is so tense, like a balloon that has been inflated with too much air. War could break out at any time. Naturally, every country must have some kind of defense. This defense may be done very secretly and not easily seen, but it always has such ingredients. Whether science is advanced or not has a great relationship with the strength of a country. We cannot deny how eager the current United States is for the continuous emergence of Alexander Graham Bell, the great inventor who created the telephone and invented the airplane by imitating the flight of birds. Even the firm and courageous spirit is also needed by the United States. Although we cannot see the real world in "The Story of Alexander Graham Bell," we can see how the United States is striving to enrich its strength through production and construction.</p>
<p>To avoid the dryness of a documentary, the screenwriter used romance to spice up the mood of the play; however, the screenwriter's writing skills are not delicate. For example, when Bell and Mabel went on their first outing, he did not seize the opportunity to embellish it, but let it slip away very plainly; especially, the screenwriter did not use Mabel's deafness to add interesting descriptions. Of course, the screenwriter's main purpose is not here. Most of his writing focuses on Bell's struggle, such as Bell moving several times, and how he fainted due to excessive hunger. This kind of writing is naturally very good, but it also seems a bit boring as a result.</p>
<p>The director also mostly focuses on Bell's hard work. Every time he describes Bell's partial success, it is quite gimmicky; however, there are not many profound scenes. In terms of character memory, Hubbard's personality is written most clearly. His stubborn and conservative image is deeply engraved in the audience's mind. I think the most touching scene is when the deaf child calls "Papa" and the father sheds tears.</p>
<p>Loretta Young played Mabel and performed very well in general, especially in the first hug with Bell. However, she did not grasp the characteristics of a deaf girl, otherwise, she could have shown her novel acting skills. For example, her low pronunciation is not very reasonable (it is naturally a little emotional in expression), because a deaf person does not have such sensitive adjustment of sound.</p>
<p>Don Ameche (Bell)'s facial expressions lacked variety. There was no obvious distinction between tension and depression, first love and passionate love. However, locally speaking, several scenes were quite good.</p>
<p>Others, such as those who played Hubbard and the little deaf child, all had above-average performances.</p>
<h3>The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou Summer School on Connaught Road Does Not Charge Tuition Fees and Provides Books</h3>
<p>— (Min Qiang)</p>
<p>The four types of summer schools mentioned by Mr. Gong Huai on the second all charge considerable tuition fees. In addition, there is another type of summer school that does not charge tuition fees, which is supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>In this type of voluntary summer school, the teachers are college and high school students who are still studying at school. They take advantage of this long two-month summer vacation to gather a few enthusiastic classmates, borrow a few classrooms from their alma mater, and gather poor children who are unable to study in the vicinity of the school to instill ordinary knowledge in them during this two-month vacation. Tuition fees are not charged, and even books are provided to them. Here, some people may ask where the funding for this voluntary summer school comes from. It can be said that it is all donated by the teachers who run these schools. Donations from the outside are of course very welcome, but they are rare. This kind of teaching enthusiasm is really admirable. Unfortunately, the number of this type of summer school is very small. For example, the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou Voluntary Summer School (located on Connaught Road) is a good example. The teachers are all high school students from the school. Tuition fees are not charged and books are provided. It is said that they are still recruiting students.</p>
<p>Now, summer has arrived. I sincerely hope that the general public in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about education can set up more voluntary summer schools during this summer vacation.</p>
<h3>After the Rain Comes Sunshine</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Encouraging Agricultural Studies to Store Materials for the Country, Keeping the Strong and Eliminating the Weak to Select Seeds with a Field</p>
<p>Zhu Ai'ren called to the old father not to go in, as the elderly are afraid of catching a cold. Zhu Aiqun boasted that her body was strong and she was not afraid of the cold, but when she came in, her teeth were chattering against each other. The He sisters grew up in the southern country and were of course even more unable to bear it. Inside the cold storage, shelves were set up, and the seed papers were hung on them row by row, densely packed. Field Director Ge said to Village Chief Zhu, "Fortunately, this cold storage was built very spacious by Jianchu. The original design was to store seed papers for other seed farms that did not have cold storage facilities. But now, other seed farms also have cold storage facilities, and the number of seeds we release each year is increasing, so if we want to expand, this cold storage will also feel cramped." He Shuangyu said, "If you want to go in and hide in this room on a hot day, it's much colder than those air-conditioned rooms in the cities." Zhu Aiqun said, "It's like a person going into a big ice cellar. Such a cold and hot environment is harmful to the human body. Perhaps the workers here are used to going in and out, so there is nothing to worry about." Field Director Ge said, "So the workers are used to enduring hardships, and they are willing to go through fire and water." He Shuangyu said, "Field Director Ge! What you said is exactly the opposite. Those who are willing to go through fire and water are going to hot places, but we are going to cold places." Everyone thought about this picky statement and laughed. Field Director Ge also laughed and said, "The workers have to go to both cold and hot places. Just put on a few more clothes when walking into this cold room. I used to visit them at Jingdezhen in Jiangxi to see them burn porcelain. The workers had to go into the kiln, which was scorching hot everywhere. They soaked the clothes they wore in cold water and then put them back on. When they came out, their clothes were also dried. So I asked them, 'You are usually used to being naked, so why not go in naked?' But they said, 'It's not good to be naked, it's like treating a person's body as a burning kiln.' But in the beginning, they were always unwilling to make improvements. Chinese workers always stuck to the old ways, but now, of course, it's another matter. Therefore, don't say that political revolutions are difficult, even revolutions in agriculture and industry are even more difficult." They talked and talked, and Field Director Ge accompanied them to a sitting room outside. Field Director Ge began to speak and said, "I originally wanted to visit Village Chief Zhu, not for anything else, but for the fact that the field will be slightly expanded next year, and there are several things that need to be discussed with Village Chief Zhu."

<h3>Biographies of Female Storytellers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Chen Yue'e: Chen Yue'e was as famous as Yuan Yunxian. This is what Chi Pingsou called "the two people who combined beauty and talent, one was Chen Yue'e, and the other was Yuan Yunxian." He said that Chen Yue'e was the niece of Chen Zhixiang, "beautiful and of good quality, playing the zither and composing music, its rhythm is round and gentle, quiet and secluded, like a wisp of gossamer, floating alone in the clear sky, and her attitude is also very pitiful. Only she is often ill, and rarely appears on stage. I recently heard that she has married." He explained a lot about Yue'e's art. As for her life, Wang Tao's "Hai Zou Ye You Lu," Volume 4, has a biography. The text says:</p>
<p>Chen Yue'e is also a talented prostitute in Shanghai. She was originally a girl from a good family. After her father died, she had no way to make a living, so she entered Pingkang. She studied when she was young, and when she grew up, she devoted herself to poetry and lyrics, and then she was able to chant. ... Dozens of people in the whole family depended on the prostitute alone. Her stepmother, Zhixiang, was cruel and treated her especially harshly. ... The prostitute was slender and graceful, looking like a celestial being. Her nature was dignified and serious, and she did not laugh casually. ... She liked to talk about poetry with scholars and was never tired of it. ...</p>
<p>One section in Volume 2 also mentions Chen Zhixiang, saying that "Shanghai women who tell stories are called 'teachers', which are mostly the ancient ballads. In recent years, such as Chen Zhixiang, they have been particularly successful. They can be said to be the successors of Lu Xiuyun and can be called the most outstanding among the flowers. Yue'e and Yuezhen are both Zhixiang's top students, and no one can hope to match them. Zhixiang has a plump body, elegant and beautiful, with a unique charm. Yue'e is charming and beautiful, and Yuezhen is young and beautiful, especially captivating. When singing, they each hold musical instruments and go on stage, either with complex strings and rapid beats, or with gentle and long chants. The seven-character beautiful sentences they chant sound like hundreds of orioles in spring, intoxicating people's hearts. The stories they tell are humorous, lifelike, and meticulously described. Their intentions are vivid and imaginative, which is something that no Shanghai woman can dream of, because they don't lose their lifelikeness or become sloppy, forgetting that they are women. Zhixiang is unique in her ability to dominate the stage because she has mastered the essence of this and is meticulous. Yue'e is good at singing ditties, and has traveled all over the stage, and no one can match her. After the song ends and the person is far away, the remaining sound lingers, which is really fascinating." This not only explains a lot about Yue'e, but also about the Chen family's performing arts. In his "Ding Chou (1877) Shanghai Book Immortal Flower List," Gong Zhi put Yue'e as a "beautiful product," comparing her to "Qionghua," and commenting that "she refines her heart and turns everything she touches into spring," which can be said to be very insightful. There were also many poems given to her at that time, and here are a few that are enough to explain Yue'e:</p>
<p>Could it be that the fairy from the Moon Palace has been demoted to earth, and remembers the beautiful songs of the world in her games? The zither strings play towards the melting moon, and there is much parting sorrow in the sad sound. - A guest from Kanjiang.</p>
<p>The clear lacquer sings bamboo branches, and the clear voice has long been the best of the time. I came not to seek the late spring, but I have seen her jade face in the flower lane.</p>
<p>The embroidered pavilion opens the garden in spring, and the elegant mark is beyond the dust. There is no equal in the history of the Wu Palace flowers, and she is the first person in Jiangnan in terms of her unique skills.</p>
<p>Her style and beauty overwhelm the crowd, her words are as wonderful as a hundred gallons of pearls, and she composes many elegant sounds on the pipa, wanting to wash the flowers with abundant dew. - The president of the Flower and Moon Society, number three of four poems.</p>
<p>In addition, such as Die Chichi and others, also have gifts, but they are mostly general works given to prostitutes, and do not help to explain Yue'e, so they are not recorded. There is a poem by Zui Mo Sheng "Thoughts of Chen Yue'e," using the tune "Lang Tao Sha." The poem says: "Sitting idly, I feel bored, the golden duck incense disappears, and a lamp is facing each other in a pitiful night. The flowers are charming and the person is lazy, which is really sad today. It is difficult to describe the parting thoughts, and I have written all my feelings. I want to send a letter, but the intention is far away. Does the Qing remember the oath of yesterday? Saying it is heartbreaking." This only says that she is affectionate. (4)</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Filming (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Xia</p>
<p>(Editor's Introduction) Qiu Xia came from the world of singing and dancing, and was one of the five generals of the Meihua Song and Dance Troupe. Later, she turned to the film industry. Her debut work was "Parents and Children" (produced by the Culture Company). Later, she joined Mingxing and collaborated with Hu Die in "The Eternal Smile" and the post-war films "Night of Terror," "Scandal," and "The Orphan Saves Her Mother." Her skillful acting has been well received. She recently joined Xinhua Company and signed a contract a few days ago, it is said.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. Unknowingly, I have been in the film industry for four years. I often hear the saying, "It's hard to be a person, it's hard to be a good person, it's hard to be human, and it's hard to be a good person." After four years of living in front of the camera, I have also come to a conclusion, which is: "It's hard to film, it's hard to film a play, it's hard to film a play, and it's hard to film a difficult play."</p>
<p>The reason why I have this twelve-character fabricated conclusion is because I remembered when I first stepped into the studio, I was full of courage and didn't know the immensity of heaven and earth, or the difficulty of filming. At that time, it was probably because I had a few years of stage experience in the past, and I had too little screen experience.</p>
<p>Later, as the days of working in the studio gradually lengthened, I didn't dare to say that I had experience. I could only say that I had filmed more plays, but I felt more timid. Therefore, I often felt that "the more I filmed, the more I dared not film," and "the more I filmed, the more I felt that filming was difficult."</p>
<p>Every actor, having filmed many plays, knows from experience that filming is easy, but being "refined" is difficult. So strictly speaking, filming is still difficult. In particular, I often watch foreign films and see the superb acting skills of foreign artists, which really makes me ashamed. This is not to say "increase other people's ambition and destroy one's own prestige." To be honest, foreign artists' cultivation and training are much higher than ours. I always remember Garbo saying, "An actor must not only express emotions, but also express thoughts." In Garbo's incisive words, one can see the level of foreign artists. At the same time, it also gives us a good example, knowing that an actor is not just copying the script, walking a few steps in front of the camera like a gourd, or saying a few words under the microphone, and that's it.</p>

<h3>Hearing Mr. Ju Peng in Two Plays (Part 2) – Most Admiring of Two Words</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Today, listening to Ju Peng singing the word "thief" in "...go and capture the thief," he still respects what he learned and has not changed it. He remains unchanged, a solitary sober person in a crowd of drunks; a lone crane among a flock of chickens. The sound entering my ears is like drinking fine wine, like finding a rare treasure, like hearing heavenly music. Thus, my whole body is happy, my mind is clear and cool, almost as if I have ascended to the heavens. Not only is it mere happiness, but at this time, the spirits of the late Mr. Tan and Chen the Twelfth Master in heaven must also nod their heads in praise. Why? Tan Yingxiu received this way of singing this word from his predecessors. In the eyes of opera fans, it is no less than the Duke of Zhou receiving the Way from Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu, the Two Kings. Mr. Yanheng imparting it to us is like establishing rites and music and writing the Spring and Autumn Annals. Now, his successor can uphold the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals without being negligent. If the two gentlemen were to have a spirit, how could they not stroke their beards and laugh, repeatedly exclaiming that their Way is not alone! However, Ju Peng is not someone who never changes words or tunes. In his works of the past ten years, he often changes the various characters of the Yangping tone to the lowest pitch to suit his voice. Now, in important places, he alone does not change it. Fortunately, it is preserved, which makes it even more commendable and worthy of praise. Hearing this one word, even if the rest of the tune is sung poorly, it is acceptable. Hearing this one word, even if the words of the entire song are changed to the point of being incomprehensible, it is acceptable. Why? Because this one word has indeed not been changed. If Ju Peng rashly followed the path of Yu Shuyan, disregarding the rules of singing and not adhering to his teacher's teachings, and suddenly changed the word "thief" to the "He Si" low tone, and smugly thought he was singing with correct words and a round tone, then I, a mere nobody with no axe or adze in hand, could only follow the rule of "self-inflicted crime" and learn from Kongming to give him "forty strokes of the meat stick"? (The words "meat stick" are a humorous anecdote from a certain grand performance of "Beheading Ma Su." It turns out that Wang Ping was originally supposed to receive forty strokes of the military stick, but the pronunciation of "shi" [ten] was unclear, and it turned into the "-qiu" rhyme, almost becoming "rou" [meat], thus becoming "meat stick." Wang Ping said, "Military sticks are easy to bear, but meat sticks are hard to endure." I borrow this to make a laugh. Ju Peng knows this story and will certainly not take it to heart.) Therefore, I say it is especially worthy of praise.</p>
<p>"Hong Yang Dong" is also one of the late Tan's signature plays. In the opening Yuanban, the word "xian" [idle] in "ban ri xian kong" [half a day of leisure], although it is in the Yangping tone, because it concerns the rules of singing, is sung in the high "chi" tone, not the low "He Si" tone. The reason is the same as why the word "thief" in "Empty City Stratagem" cannot be sung low. I will not elaborate further. I heard Ju Peng sing "Hong Yang Dong" on the third day of the play, and when he sang the word "xian," it was indeed the "chi" high-pitched tone of the Tan method. (Ban ri [half a day], saying ban dian [half a point] is also good; they are commonly used.) Hearing this way of singing this word is truly worthy of a large toast, further proving that his singing of the word "thief" in "Empty City Stratagem" without going to the low tone is a carefully crafted effort to preserve the Tan method. Having these two words to listen to is worth two entire big plays. A play is big, but if it is not sung well, it is not as good as the joy and satisfaction of one good word. That is why I say so. Apart from these two words, I have thousands of words to say, but I have not been able to say them. I will wait a while, and I will have to say them all at once, or else I will suffocate!</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai's Movie Theaters (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiaochun</p>
<p>The number of movie theaters currently in this city is not less than before the war, although several movie theaters were affected by the war and could not resume business, such as Shanghai, Southeast, and East China. However, most of the movie theaters are located in the foreign concession areas, which were not only unaffected, but also, due to the abnormal prosperity of this city, the "full house" sign is almost always hung at the door. There are also three or four new ones, such as Jinmen and Huguang, and even those located in Hongkou have resumed operations, such as Rongguang and Weili. There are also two or three theaters that are still under construction. Statistics for the foreign concession areas alone show twenty-eight movie theaters of various sizes. Those in the Hongkou area and the movie theaters attached to amusement parks are not included.</p>
<p>Movie theaters are divided into first-run, second-run, and third-run based on the order in which they screen films. Films can also be divided into foreign films and domestic films. Most foreign films are American films. It is said that there are also Soviet Russian, British, and French films shown, but they are few in number. The American film companies include: Warner Bros. First National, Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century Fox, United Artists, Universal, Columbia, and RKO, which manage everything. The domestic film companies include Xinhua, Yihua, Huaxin, Huacheng, Guohua, Tiansheng, and Lianyi, which produce and supply films. Now, the three classes of movie theaters are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) First-Run Theaters</p>
<p>A. Screening Foreign Films – Da Guangming, Nanjing, Guotai, Da Shanghai.</p>
<p>B. Screening Domestic Films – Jincheng, Xinguang, Huguang.</p>
<p>(Huguang also screens Soviet Russian films and second-run American films)</p>
<p>(2) Second-Run Theaters</p>
<p>A. Screening Foreign Films – Jinmen, Lido, Paris, Guangyi, Ping'an.</p>
<p>B. Screening Domestic Films – Zhongyang, Empire.</p>
<p>(Empire also screens third-run foreign films)</p>
<p>(3) Third-Run Theaters (Mostly screening both domestic and foreign films)</p>
<p>A. Dedicated Movie Theaters – Xihai, Yixi, Guanghua, Zhejiang, Mingxing, Jiuxing, Layi, Dumei, Rongjin, Yameng.</p>
<p>B. Also Performing Peking Opera – Qi Wutai, Carlton, Huangjin.</p>
<p>The four major first-run foreign film theaters are all under the management of the Asia Film Company, so ticket prices are naturally higher, and they often temporarily raise prices for famous films. However, in terms of facilities, they have central heating in the winter and air conditioning in the summer. The decoration and furnishings are all exquisite. In terms of management, the manager must inspect the "lobby" before each show to provide appropriate training to ensure that the service is polite and satisfactory. First-run domestic film theaters have uniform prices starting from fifty cents, and the facilities are also decent. Second-run foreign film theaters, although the price is only from thirty-three cents, their equipment and management try their best to catch up with the first-run foreign film theaters, so they meet the conditions of being cheap and good. As for third-run movie theaters, the lowest price starts from only eleven cents, so in terms of equipment, they have no choice but to replace central heating with stoves and air conditioning with electric fans. However, in order to compete for business, some have better facilities. The waiters are also lacking in training, so quarrels with customers are often heard.</p>
<h3>"Femme Fatale" Travels to Europe Again – Li Li of Beiping Sets Sail Soon</h3>
<p>— Yinbi</p>
<p>First to Hollywood, Then to Britain and France</p>
<p>Scheduled Trip to Last Eight Months</p>
<p>The famous dancer Li Li of Beiping, since being cleared of suspicion in the espionage case in Chongqing and released from prison in Hong Kong, was hired by Lianyi Company to star in the film "Femme Fatale." Due to the circumstances of this suspicion case, which was widely reported in the newspapers and caused a sensation for a time, Li Li's remuneration for filming "Femme Fatale" reached a huge sum of three thousand Hong Kong dollars (equivalent to more than five thousand national currency). Six or seven years ago, Li Li performed in the sound film "Spring Tide" in Shanghai, and her compensation was only three hundred yuan. Comparing the past with the present, the difference is tenfold. It seems that this dragon gate price is precisely a stroke of good fortune that came to her as a result of misfortune.</p>
<p>Previously, Yihua Company was preparing to shoot the film "Women's Apartment" and had written to Li Li to discuss starring in it. At that time, she asked for too high a price, and it did not work out. Mr. Yan Youxiang, the owner of Yihua, went to Hong Kong this time to invite Li Li to come to Shanghai for many years, but in the end, due to differences in conditions, they did not reach an agreement. At the same time, he also visited Li Li to reiterate what he said before. According to Li Li, she must go abroad for a trip to Europe in the short term, so she can only express her regret for the filming and wait until she returns to China in the future to decide to shoot a film for Yihua first.</p>
<p>Now, Li Li is busy preparing her luggage. This long march to Europe, she said, is only for travel purposes. The first destination is Hollywood to observe in person, hoping to gain some knowledge in the film industry. Then she will travel to Switzerland, England, France, and other countries before returning to Shanghai. The estimated trip duration is at least eight months or more.</p>
<p>Li Li is very energetic and extremely intelligent, and speaks fluent English. Seven years ago, she traveled to Europe on the same ship with the athletes participating in the World Games. Now she is about to cross the ocean again for her second grand tour!</p>
<p>Huang Jun Jingbo is a native of Xinghua, Jiangsu. He loves to study Peking Opera in his spare time. He has studied for less than two years and is good at many Hua Shan operas, such as "Wu Jia Po," "Complete Xunyang Tower," "Qijie," "Complete Exploring Mother," "Baolian Lantern," "Hui Long Ge," "Hui Jing Zhou," and "Zhan Wancheng." He has been instructed by famous teachers. Each time he performs in major theaters, he is praised. He is happy to do good deeds and is afraid of falling behind in participating in charity events. This time (i.e., June 27th), he was hired by the fellow villagers of Yangzhou to guest star in "Zhan Wancheng" in the Golden Obligation Opera. He and Madam Zou performed very well. The picture on the right is his latest opera costume.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Reason for Jin Shaoshan's Great Success After Going North</p>
<p>However, among the actors, Yunfu is the oldest, and the backstage is crowded and chaotic. At the same time, the kitchen has to prepare meals for tens of thousands of people, which is even more inconvenient for him to casually ask for snacks. Yunfu is, after all, an old man who has not performed for many years. His daily diet and routine are fixed. Moreover, that day he was playing the Guotai in "Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness." If he had to wait until this grand finale play was over before eating, it would simply starve the old man to death. At this time, I saw Jin Lao busy with sweat on his forehead, walking quickly, holding a bowl of egg fried rice in one hand and a bowl of soup in the other, dripping oil stains all over his robe, walking to Lao Xi's couch, presenting it to him, and saying, "Uncle, please eat quickly. If I were not familiar with the chef and had been in Shanghai for a long time, I would not have been able to get even this bit of food." Although the above are just some small things, they made all the famous actors in Beiping backstage see that Shao Yun is indeed very mindful of the past. He is definitely not like a certain famous actor who, when his father was alive, sometimes lost his temper as an actor, slamming the table and scolding, "All of you are eating my father's food." If he is so disrespectful to his own parents, then he would simply ignore those who had a relationship with his deceased father. Therefore, the higher Shao's reputation, the lower his airs, and he does not value money very much.</p>
<p>Previously, I talked about Hao Shoushen's overemphasis on money. In Pingjin, no matter who invited him to perform, he had to get the money first. Moreover, the price was fixed and there was no room for compromise. Xiao Lou Qingkui was also angered by him. Sometimes, it rained and the attendance was not good, so he worked in vain and paid out of his own pocket, but Shoushen's share of one or two hundred yuan was firmly in his pocket. When I traveled to Ping a few years ago, many insiders told me that Shoushen did not care about the solidarity of his colleagues. He looked down on everyone and considered himself the Taishan Beidou [leading figure] of the Jing role. (May Fourth)</p>
<h3>Wang Xichun as Zuo Yizhen</h3>
<p>— Weite</p>
<p>Carlton's "Heavenly Flowers" has been performed up to the seventeenth and eighteenth episodes until the recent break. I have always been a proponent of "Sunday Entertainment" and have been watching it since the first two episodes started. Mr. Zhou Xinfang's plays are indeed worth watching a hundred times, no wonder Carlton's seats are always sold out on weekend day shows.</p>
<p>The main character of "Heavenly Flowers" should be Zuo Weiming played by Xinfang, and the entire play is based on the story of Weiming's lifelong dedication to eliminating traitors and supporting the weak, loyalty, filial piety, and chivalry, and the interesting stories and personal encounters of the Zuo family as the warp and weft, forming this giant structure that can be welcomed by general young ladies and wives. Some say that the deepest impression on the audience is none other than Wang Xichun's Zuo Yizhen. Indeed, in the latter half of the "Heavenly Flowers" content, it has shifted from Zuo Weiming to Zuo Yizhen. Wang Xichun started on stage skipping and jumping with two small braids, and now she has married and become a young woman. Her performance is seamless and meticulous, which is not easy. The audience's admiration for Zuo Yizhen's "strength and wisdom" is everywhere. Stabbing Zheng Guotai shows the spirit of a woman surpassing a man, and her elimination of traitors for the country can be a model for later generations of women, truly a remarkable person.

<h3>A Record of the Binhai Choir</h3>
<p>— Xinying</p>
<p>It was a midsummer evening, and after a few days of clouds and rain, a clear day arrived. The moonlight shone all over the earth, and a fairly grand concert was being held on the playground of Binhai Middle School on Nanyang Road. The performance started at 7:30 p.m. First, Principal Wang Xinming gave a brief report explaining the purpose of the music. Then, several girls presented flowers to the choir. After the flowers were presented, the performance began. First, the middle school members, about forty men and women, lined up on the stage. Under the direction of Mr. Guo Jin and the accompaniment of Mr. Gao Fayuan, they began to sing. There were five programs in total: "Association Song" (unison), "Forward" (two-part singing), "Chinese Sons" (unison), "National Song" (unison), and "Singer of the Masses" (unison), all of which were wonderful. Then, the attached elementary school, accompanied by the percussion band and under the direction of the young conductor Ji Chuan, also had thirty or forty male and female members singing three songs: "Song of the Brave Warriors" (two-part singing), "Jin Xi" (unison), and "Gan Gan Gan" (unison), all of which were sung well. Especially the percussion band, holding gongs, drums, and other instruments, beat them very nicely, without missing a beat.</p>
<p>There was also Ren Tingsong's female solo, singing the song Noctuine; Pan Shuzhen's piano solo, the score Bottle of Woteroo; Dong Yulong's solo, singing the song "Looking at the Moon." It just so happened that the moon in the sky was hanging in the air, and he could sing while looking at the moon, making it particularly affectionate; Chen Zhuoguang, Chen Delin, and Yang Qin Song Qing performed a duet of "Autumn Moon in the Han Palace." Whether it was a solo or a solo song, each person had their own strengths. Other songs such as "The Blue Sky with a White Sun Unfolded," "Morning Sun," "West Lake," "Sailing," and "National Flag" by the middle school department were two, three, and four-part harmonies, all of which were sung well. And the finale opera "Farewell" and "Song of Light" were the soul of the entire program, very wonderful. By the time the meeting was adjourned, it was already 10:30 p.m.</p>
