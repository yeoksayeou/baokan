<h3>哈立法克斯向郭使保証　英政府仍願繼續援華　謂東京協定並未違反九國公約　赫爾重行申明美遠東政策不變</h3>
<p>（倫敦）中國駐英大使郭泰祺今日午後訪英外相哈立法克斯、詢問關於英日妥洽之情報、並調査局勢之眞相當時郭大使提出抗議、反對英國在華北作任何可能的讓步、致損害中國利益、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據今日透露之消息、中國大使郭泰祺昨晚與外相哈立法克斯作長時間之晤談、哈氏曾重申在國會中所作之保蹬、卽英日妥洽並不包含英國對華政策之有何變更、或對華可能的援助之拒絕是、（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）中國駐英大使郭泰祺、頃於午後訪晤哈里法克斯外相、當卽因英日兩國初步協定違反九國公的、而表示不滿之意、並向外相力言、此項協定是否別有作用、可由英國是吾賡續以借款與信用放款給與中國獲得分曉云、按英國對華信用放款數百萬鎊、未能如期支付、中國政府早有不滿之表示、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）昨日英政府已予中國當局以確實之保蹬、據謂有田與克萊琪之協定、並未默允日軍有駐華權利、同時亦未表示英國已改變其遠東政策、此項保證係由外相哈里法克斯給予中國駐英大使郭泰祺、査郭氏事前曾請英方說明東京協定、郭氏指出該項協定顯已違反九國公的及其他國聯決議案、哈氏答謂、在東京協定中、英方已承認日軍已駐在中國、但避免聲述英方贊同日軍之侵略行爲、所有九國公的及國聯議決案、並不因新協定而有所變更、在新恊定中、英國並未承認日本之交戰國權利、哈氏昨晚雖承認在下决會談中、將提及中國幣制問題、但英國仍堅持、非得美國及其他有關各國之同意、中國法幣問題決無法解決、據英政府發言人聲稱、日方本擬要求英國停止以借款貸與中國、嗣經克氏力爭、日方始不再堅持、因此各方認爲英國對中國之三百萬鎊新借款卽將成立、（二十五日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間各觀察家今日皆豫料英國將不致轉變其今在遠東所行之政策、據國務院官員宣稱、卽使日本希望簽訂與英日所商妥者相同之協定、美國亦無意爲之云、（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）赫爾國務卿本日招待各報記者時、或就英首相張伯倫所作聲明、叩其意見、據答稱、美國態度如何、余於六月十九日業已加以說明、貴記者請覆按可也、抑自彼時起以迄今茲、遠東時局並未發生變化、美國亦無改變政策之理由、（按赫爾國務卿曾謂天津事件所由引起之事端、與美國政府無干、但「其發展情形曁其意義、則徵諸中國其他各處已往與今茲所聞所見、其範圍極爲廣大、美國實與有關係）此外、中國境內近頃發生各種事故、牽涉美國人在內者、其經過情形余已接獲報吿、此類爭端屢見迭出、余正以極大興趣與焦念、加以注視、卽如美國軍艦「關島」號書記倍克、在漢口被日本哨兵毆擊事、亞洲艦隊司令雅納爾少將已向海軍部提出報吿、據稱、此事完全應由日兵負責、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>中國政府當局　保持審愼態度　渝民衆反英情緒滋長</h3>
<p>（重慶）中國當局對所傳東京英日會議中獲得之妥洽、刻保持審愼態度、而少壯極端派則露不耐之象、該派批評曰、若日本能從事反英運動、中國何爲不能、又曰、若英國拒不援助中國而與日本妥洽、冀犧牲中國而保其利益、則吾人必須警吿英國、中國如被摧毀、則英國可保者亦所剩無幾矣、該派責英國背棄中國、謂英大使寇爾法大使戈斯默最近赴渝時、中政府爲表示中國願與英法合作之誠意起見、令租界中終止一切反日活動、然試看外人租界中現况如何、其反華活動已增多矣、如情勢至最惡劣時、華人能悉數退出租界、並同時開始對付辦法、使租界主人翁愕然坐起、而重行考慮其態度云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（重慶）中國人士對於英日妥洽原文、前雖亟欲知其內容、今方加以縝密研究、然以一般言、並未過份重視之、咸以爲無論妥洽措詞如何、然英國已與日本妥協則爲事實、蔣總裁昨晨在英日公報發表以前、即已演講中國之態度、可見英國已作讓步矣、今渝地到處顯見華人之反英情緒正在滋長中、下述批評可概其餘、其言曰、若張伯倫所解之語、僅爲野蠻武力與暴行、則今後吾人將據而行之云、持重份子則主張自今而後、中國務須完全不理會外國援助之可能性而自行作戰、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（重慶）此間華方對於英日之東京初步協定、認為較其預料者為佳、惟多數華人不願討論將來之問題、因此項協定能吾如張伯倫在下院中之所言而執行、猶在不可知之數、初步協定中最令華人滿意之點、即英方並未提供嚴守中立之諾言、亦未承認戰爭狀態之存在、而中止對華之貨幣援助與放款、允其並無封閉滇緬交通綫之可能性、至於所謂「日本控制之地區」是否包括各國在華之租界、實為一疑問、假若包括各國在華之租界、則在租界中之華人愛國活動、皆將從此吿終、親華之報紙或皆將關門大吉、同時華人銀行家與商人亦將蒙受相當之不利、但租界或不能解作日軍控制區耳、某部華人以為英國與日本今次之成議、假若歐戰爆發、則英即可用以滿足日方之要求、從而確保其在華之利益、假使歐戰不起、則英國又可以初步成議中無此規定、而拒絕日方之種種要求、並以財政援助中國之姿態、威脅日本而使之就範、惟華人各界皆認初步成議、並未解决英日間之何項爭端、故此後在解釋上實施上必有許多衝突（二十五日美聯電）</p>
<h3>日閣會議　商討對華新政策</h3>
<p>（東京）今晨日內閣會議、討論諾蒙亨事件及中國形勢與法幣低落事、陸相板垣報吿滿蒙邊界新衝突情形、藏相石渡於陳述中國法幣價値低落之原因後、謂法幣低落之最大原因、爲外匯平準基金之不予支持云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）藏相石渡今日預料若現局繼續不變、則中國法幣行將續跌、並主張確定一種獨立貨幣政策、以對付法幣跌價之必耍閣員旋對中國戰事自由交換意見、聞陸相板坦不願發表意見、內相木戶主張依照中國「新局勢」及日本方面堅决意旨之實施、確定新計畫以解决中國事件、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>英日妥協方案　英報一致擁護　中國法幣仍當繼續支持　日方激烈宣傳不可輕信</h3>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報外交記者今日論英日方案、謂倫敦許多外國觀察家昨夜皆以爲對於英日妥洽之第二轉念尙屬不惡、英國在其方案中、並未有何放棄、不過整理現已存在之事態而提供、如運用審愼、則可爲將來生活狀况之基礎而已、此種方案確未作英國業已預先自行束縛而須依允在華日軍司令所可提出的任何要求之能也云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）數報今日會贊同日方對芙日妥協所作之解釋、並有多報力主英國當繼續援助中國法幣、「新聞紀事報」謂、現恐蘇美兩國或將認日方對英日談話之見解更屬可行、因行動較空言爲有力、故英政府當謀以巨款貸予中國、以表明其所言之不誣、、此爲英政府對中國在東方從事大戰所能表示承認之特殊方法、認識旣往事實、實較維護此「租界或彼」租界之英國權利更形重耍、今應以行動爲佐證云、「孟却斯德指導報謂、」就寬大之見解而論、英政府今乃故意接受空泛之方案、以期天津爭案早獲解決、如日本擬認此妥協將施於中國全部、等於英國担保對日本征略之合作、如此種解釋整個錯誤、則儘速解除在華在美在英因所釀之損害、實爲最善之道、吾人所當聲明者、吾人今日援助中國法幣、其重要不减於前、吾人對所能供給中國之任何材料而助其繼續抗戰者、斷不能限制共輸出、吾人志在各租界之保守中立或屬正當、但在中日兩國間更廣大之奮鬥中、冷血之中立在吾人旣不可能、且非所願云、「每日郵報」謂、克萊琪在甚困難之工作中應付尙佳、渠已安然渡過英口談判中之第一難關矣、茲日本報紙傳來碍及英國在華地位之十一項要求、但張伯倫已在下院切實聲明、談話將純以地方事件爲限、英國允不應有所行動、致妨碍中國幣制、日方有兩種論調、其激烈者吾人應置諸不理、其溫和者則似較有權威云、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）「每日電報」今日聲稱、東京方面侈稱已爲東亞新秩序獲一大勝利、而德國報紙則盛傳英國之屈服、此皆爲以呌號掩蓋鎭靜的談判之外交新術中不幸而不可免的例證、雖人心不無惶慮、誠恐英國屈服之說或爲事實、然官塲文吿或張伯倫簡短言論中、並未有可爲人惶慮之理由、日本軍閥政治家似會希望有田將廢止法幣流通·召回駐華大使·停止假道緬甸的接濟·及承認傀儡政府等提議、液入天津事件之談判中、然就張伯倫所發此後討論將僅限於天津地方事件之言論觀之、似上述提案縱曾提出、然已撒銷而未必復活矣、遠東軍事局勢現未有新特色、而日軍近來對於英人之態度、確未有須使英國政策完全改變之理由、天津爭議之解決、不獨為英政府所願有、亦為日政府所需要、爲繼續談話起見、乃有使英國明白承認日方侵略之協定、但此種承認固含有中國抗戰力之實現爲其重要成分也云、（廿五日路透電）</p>
<h3>東報自詡　外交成功</h3>
<p>（東京）日本各報今日皆賀外相有田之外交成功、並稱讚英國以其在東京表示政治家風度也、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）海相米內言及英大使克萊琪與日外相有田之談話、警吿全國不能認爲談話結果、英國已完全改變其遠東政策、據稱、今必須注視英國對於各個問題、包括貨幣問題在內之態度云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>中國法幣　穩定問題　英國工黨議員　喚起政府注意</p>
<p>（倫敦）下議院本日午後開會時、反對派工黨議員貝倫傑會就中國法幣滙價再度低落事、喚起政府注意、並詢問中國滙兌平準基金是吾確已用罄、西門財相常即答稱、「中國法幣地位曁平準基金帳目、均須保守秘密、此與吾國或任何國同樣帳目之應保守秘密者、初無二致、貴議員定能了解及之、余嘗於七月十一日發出聲明、此外無所損益」云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）金融新聞頃稱、中國協會咋日集議、考慮應否請英政府補充中國幣制平用基金、蓋信原有基金現將開罄也、會衆在政策上、未曾成立決定、旋休會以硏究首相張伯倫關於東京談話之言論、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>英援華會　仗義執言</h3>
<p>（倫敦）援華委員會今日發表一文、謂英相張伯倫在下院發言時所宣布之英日方案、簡直對於英勇抗戰以衛國家獨立與土地完整之中國、予以無可抵賴之背棄、九國公約之條款與義務、及國聯通知各會員國以物質援助給予中國不得採行可挫弱中國抗戰力的行動亦不得承認武力所造成的局勢之決議案、英國信誓尙在、必須遂守、蓋唯有履行此種義務、始可保持英國之尊榮、而免爲侵略行爲中之從犯也云、（二十五日路透社電）</p>

<h3>英日初步協定</h3>
<p>本報旣於前日，就所傳之英國對日讓步而泛論之。及昨日，倫敦東京兩地，同時發表英日兩國東京會議所締立之初步協定。茲請檢討之：</p>
<p>協定內容，已刋昨報，記者爲行文便利計，更錄於次：</p>
<p>「英政府完全承認大規模戰事刻在進行中之中國的實况，並承認此種事態長此繼續存在時，在華日軍有特殊之需要，以保障其自己之安全與維持其控制區域中之公共秩序，並對於足以妨礙日軍或有利敵人之任何行動或事件，當予以制止或消除，英政府對於任何行動足以妨礙日軍達到上述目的者，並無予以助成之意，並將乘此機會，明白吿知在華英國官憲及僑民，應勿作此項行爲及計畫，以證實英國關於此事所抱之政策。」</p>
<p>檢討此項協定有意外之點，凡：（一）協定內無中立字樣。數週以來，日英朝野乃至其他任何方面，凡涉租界問題與東京談判，輒以中立云云爲重心；本報亦嘗評述『英國對遠東能吾守中立，』謂無此理，無此權；今協定果語不及中立。倫敦報紙於協定發表之後，且以並未承認日本享有交戰國權利，爲解嘲之一端，是亦以協定未言中立爲論據者也。關於此點，今日不遑詳論；所不可不知者，此乃外交文書之技巧，此乃偸天換日，還櫝取珠之手腕，英日雙方各以如此躲避爲得計也。（二）協定內無英國權利。原國際一般契的，以相互爲原則；雖城下之盟，戰勝國亦予戰敗國以不同程皮之餘地；而此項協定，祇有英國片面對日本，承認復承認；此必舉世所欲稱之爲標準的默書。夫東京談判，固英國所建議，英人且嘗以日本接受建議而稱慶幸；顧乃建議者之初步成就，僅爲「承認復承認」，而於其自身之權利，絲毫不爲對方所齒數，此誠英國外交之奇蹟矣！</p>
<p>次請就協定內容，爲之分析：英國所「完全」承認者，其範圍有如左述：</p>
<p>（一）關於事實者　在中國有大規校之戰事，正在進行；</p>
<p>（二）關於時期者　大規模戰事繼續存在之時期；</p>
<p>（三）關於對手者　日軍；</p>
<p>（四）關於目的者　日軍需要保障其自己之安全，需要維持其控制區域中之公共秩序，需要制止或消除足以妨碍日軍之任何行動或事件，需要制止或消除足以有利華軍之任何行動或事件；</p>
<p>（五）關於消極義務者　英國政府不助成凡足妨碍日軍達到上述目的之任何行動；</p>
<p>（六）關於積極義務者　英國政府應命在華英國官員僑民仰體此意，一律奉行。</p>
<p>記者竊自信於此種分析之忠實與準確。允願英國人士及世界人士，將此種分析與協定全文比較之後，更與英國首相張伯倫於二十四日即發表協定之日，在英國下議院所聲稱「此次談判以天津地方爭案爲限」云云相印證，是吾忠實？是吾準確？此則竊願張伯倫去其雨傘，示上天以眞面目者也。</p>
<p>此項協定，以其爲初步性質，故未涉及何種共體問題；惟無具體問題，故英國保守黨之一部人猶爲張伯倫辨護而諱言失敗！然範圍具在，目的釐然，英國已以默書式「完全」承認之矣，故日本及德義兩國在歡於英國之屈服日本之成功。雖然，成敗之鑑別，何待具體問題。以英國所完全承認之日軍目的，以英國所負片面之消極義務與積極義務，較之九國公的規定中國領土主權行政之完整，則何以承認大規模戰事之進行？何以承認具此目的之日軍行動？較之英國迭决對日要求開放長江珠江，何以承認日方所據爲理由之軍事需要？而英國駐華大使館武官史比亞中校大可以妨碍日軍需要，牴觸英國義務而罪在該死；此所謂需要與義務，固英國所完全承認者也；不死，有待日軍容許爲旣往不咎，從寬發落。凡此所舉，以今日之協定，衡量近年來英日間懸而未決之問題，日成英敗，已灼然於此初步協定，復可諱耶！</p>
<p>至於依據此項初步協定而發展爲二步三步，則有待英日雙方今後之步步交涉；未及其時，未及其事，初不必遽爾武斷；某類問題某類事件，將以初步協定爲根據而將來成何形態，作何結局。然就初步協定，而大體推論之，則英國對於日本，若提出任何請求，任何抗議，日本俱得以軍事需要爲無堅不禦之盾；日本對於英國，若提出任何要求，任何抗議，日本俱得以軍事需要爲無堅不陷之矛。矛與盾，利器也，強國皆得而有之；而英國之利器，至少在外交上，以初步協定而對日繳械，乃為日本所獨有。</p>
<p>抑步步交涉，事在雙方，一一迎拒，權操自我；日本儘作奢求，英國何難峻拒；是初步協定如彼，英國豈無盤旋餘地？詎日悉數英倫鐵，鑄此一大錯耶？唯唯，誠有然也；何者始爲軍事需要，何者始爲妨碍行動，胥視解釋何似耳；日本如此解釋，英國得不如此解釋，此一是非，彼一是非，豈有定論。世有正義感者，孰不憐憫英國而期以振作，孰則同情日本而爲之張目？是英國而能把握解釋，拒所必拒，自爲舉世所樂見樂聞。雖然，是可期耶？證以英國近頃之舉措，固不僅外交政策之大敗大錯，蓋心理上理智上旣有其根本之大敗大錯。小而言之：天津租界旣遭封鎖，英國當局之吿慰議員者，謂英僑牛乳尙幸未絕，如此云云，凡三五决，東京談判旣在進行，英國當局之央告日本者，謂排行運動不可稍休乎？此何意態耶！從大處觀察：英國時時處處視事實爲無可糾正，故對是非不敢明辨，對正義絕無信仰；時時處處打算利害，而以近利小利爲利，以近害小害爲害，故不顧悠久偉大之將來；時時處處以聰明自喜，顧爲最幼稚最凶暴所欺。往者，關切遠東，顧以綏靖歐局爲先，於是委屈求全而歐局日非。以慕尼黑協定媚德，而德國無饜；以離間德義爲務，而德義締盟。今者，以東京談判而對日讓步，以爲庶幾可以暫時穩住日本以戢德義在歐洲之囂張，是乃外交上對侵略集團各個擊破之妙術。不知日本與德義，相挾相重，必與其侵略政策相終始而永不相離。不知讓步非所以限止侵略而實以助長侵略。不知東京柏林羅馬之或動或靜或文或武，或互爲起伏，或數管齊下，乃爲對於反侵略陣綫之各個擊破！德義不但爲日本竊喜，且爲日本稱賀，亦爲彼自身喜且賀；而英法輿情指而笑之日德義爲此而憂疑且哭矣。此非心理與理智之大敗大錯耶！</p>
<p>就英日初步協定而檢討之，大致若此。至於影響遠東大局與中國抗戰者，決非甚烈。蓋英日談判與協定，不足以左右中國與遠東；反之，協定之前途，與中國之運命，乃至於英國在遠東之運命，必以中國之抗戰決定之！</p>

<h3>庫頁島糾紛　蘇聯嚴拒日抗議　責日政府袒護不法行為　中東路未批款迄未償付</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯人民外交副委員長維棠夫斯基、本日邀請日大使東鄉晤談、當將外交委員會答復日代辦西氏本年四月廿七日送來備忘錄之復文一件、面交日大使、</p>
<p>日方備忘錄所提出者、係關於北庫頁島享有石油及煤礦讓與權日商行爲之各項問題、該商歷來不斷違背合同義務、甚至不繳租金、及違犯蘇聯法律、而日政府則為其行動辯護、並對所謂蘇方機關之錯誤行爲提出抗議、</p>
<p>外交委員會此次復文、首對此項抗議斷然拒絕、指出日政府之企圖、純係不惜任何代價、爲讓與權享有商之不法行爲辯護、雖該商等業已違背合同及蘇聯法律、復文當將所有違背合同及法律之事實逐條列舉、據稱、該商等曾系統地違犯勞動安全及防火法規、不遵從蘇方勞動督察員及國立防火機關之多决勸吿、採取適當步驟以减除防火及保障勞工安全設備上之缺點、一九三八年至三九年間、檢察二百四十四處設備之結果、曾發現違犯勞動安全及防火法事件四百五十七次、因防火不周之故、讓與區曾發生火災多次、例如一九三五年十一月二日、因電力設備缺點、因此哈油區有井架兩座被火焚燬、一九三七年十一月廿一日鑽油架一座被焚、一九三八年七月十九日油棧一所完全焚燬、蘇聯政府决不能坐視此種觸犯防火法之行爲、允因讓與商所經營之油塲、係與蘇聯國營油塲犬牙交錯、讓與塲上起火、即危及隣近之蘇聯油塲乃至當地平民生命、讓與權合同中、曾肯定條列各塲鑽探測量及採挖之程序、然讓與商一貫規避全部執行必要之測量工作、從而違背蘇聯採礦法、此項技術條例爲任何人所必須遵守、日方讓與商自亦不能例外自居、該商等又違背合同及蘇聯法律關於保障勞工安全之條文、結果讓與區內曾發生意外事變多决、一九三七年一年即達九十六次、煤礦讓與區亦然、雖其工作範圍甚小、而一九三九年三個月內已發生事變七决、日方所稱蘇聯機關妨礙煤礦讓與商經營一說、絕無絲毫根據、違背合同者非蘇方機關而爲日商自己、彼等於一九三七年即已幾乎完全停止經營、由此蘇聯政府乃損失該商等應行繳納之一部份收入、僅此一點、蘇聯政府根據合同已有權於滿期前取消讓與權利、西氏備忘錄中會稱、蘇方官憲對日讓與商備施壓迫、其所舉一例、爲蘇方曾命日煤商於本年二月十五日將堆積讓與煤塲之爆炸物銷燬、實際關於此事、違法者亦爲日商、因彼等不遵守蘇聯儲藏爆炸物法規、自一九三五年十二月十四日起、日方煤礦及石油讓與商即未付應繳蘇政府之租金、其總額至今共八九二·四五七·五八蘆布、一九三七年起、石油　與商又不履行房屋建築上之義務、更據特種委員會調查結果、讓與商等一面要求由日本輸人商品及食物、一面秘密儲藏足敷六至七個月用之商品食物於已有堆棧、以備某種特殊用途、在該商之堆棧內、並曾抄獲伯爾丹式步槍·火藥·戰地望遠鏡·及其他禁止輸入蘇境之品物、又有蒸溜酒精之器具五套、及原釀數桶、同時、委員會並發現讓與商有從日本輸入稻米供給非法造酒廠之事實、並出售商品與讓與區無關之人、及私運劣質貨物食物售與工人、讓與商號積有大批貨物食糧、而乃於一九三八年十二月及一九三九年一月、兩次减少工人應得之主要食物、如肉·乳·洋葱·米·及糖等口糧額、自百分之二十至二十五、讓與合同曾規定讓與商得雇用日籍中下級工人、但不得超過總數百分之二十五、然實際該商等則屢用各種伎倆、破壊此項條例、因而至一九三八年八月、讓與區工人百分之四三·六乃爲日人、蘇方機關雖根據合同、供給充分工人、備該商等雇用、彼等則有意規避、反向日本雇用工人、例如蘇方於一九三七年應石油讓與商之請、曾招雇蘇聯工人一千七百名、送至海參威、然日商則延緩雇用至六十四日之久、一九三八年內、同樣事件亦有發生、日商於使用日本海軍油船運油經日時、亦違背蘇聯取消外國軍艦寄泊及艦員登陸之條例、各日艦艦長之橫蠻行爲、曾經蘇聯政府疊决向日政府提出抗議、</p>
<p>上述一切事實、證明日讓與商確已系統地違犯讓與權合同、妄冀在蘇聯境內、造成與現被日人强佔之滿洲境內相類之經濟活動條件、此種企圖之荒謬、母席外交委員會詳加證明、總之、蘇聯政府將斷然制止一切違背合同及蘇聯法律舉動、日方近屢放謠傳、稱蘇聯企圖取消日本在北庫頁島讓與權、此乃完全惡意的造謠、蘇聯政府與過去相同、仍切實遵守讓與合同、與其他條的、初無二致、苟日商亦切實履行合同條件、彼等之事業即可發達、總之、日政府以日讓與商非法行爲辯護人自居之一切宣言、人民外交委員會一律吾認、因其全無根據、</p>
<p>日政府關於其他問題、亦表現不忠實之態度、例如日商松井船廠、於一九三六年曾訂的爲蘇聯建造輪船三艘、當收定洋一·六四七·六五〇日圓、但至一九三八年、則不但不將造成之船交與蘇聯、並拒絕按照合同賠償損失、甚至定洋亦拒不返還、而日政府居然亦爲口辯護、</p>
<p>日政府又公然違背其莊嚴義務、於一九三八年三月拒不償付收買中東路之末批價款五·九八一·六二五日圓、迄今仍分文不交、日政府雖如此違背本身義務、並指使其國民同樣違背義務、蘇聯政府及蘇方經濟機關、則一貫遵守義務、此後亦不預備攷此原則、人民委員會茲於拒絕日方無根據之抗議之際、同時向日政府及日方讓與權享有商提出警吿、聲明蘇聯政府雖遵守其義務、然仍斷然要求日方切實在蘇聯領土內遵守法律、（二十五日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>可堪注意之　日軍事領袖赴歐　寺內大角等昨過滬赴德　此行內幕係締廣博盟約　新協定傳以軍事諒解聯擊德意日</h3>
<p>大陸戰云、首途赴柏林與羅馬作創造歴史的軍事與政治會談之日本最高軍事領袖兩人、昨（二十四日）乘鹿島丸輪抵滬、今日（二十五日）繼續其赴歐旅程、此兩人爲前華北日軍總司令、現任軍事參議官寺內壽一、及前海相現任軍事參議官大角岑生、大批隨員偕行、而日本主要工業家金融家之一井坂孝亦同行、據大陸報所獲可靠消息、井坂與日本工業聯合會總裁等主要工業家、將於十月初、與德國簽訂</p>
<p>廣泛商約</p>
<p>此日本四領袖陽爲應希特勒之邀、而赴德國紐倫堡、參加九月十一日之國社黨大會、惟聞彼等一行、負有日本與其歐洲之全能與國締結廣博的盟的之使命、聞日本駐德大使大島、已獲得德日軍事協定之初步諒解、然大島之建議、被東京之陸軍與溫和派所擱置、因恐此舉使日本與外國關係受不必要的重大傷害也、然</p>
<p>歐洲事件</p>
<p>尤其是英蘇談話之開始、以及陸軍「急進份子」之强硬壓力、導使日本改變態度、結果聞巳決定使柏林與羅馬之非正式談話得一決斷、此次兩軍　之赴柏林、不僅爲日本首次派特使往紐倫堡參加大會、抑且爲日本有史以來第四次派高級軍官負特殊使命而赴歐洲、此間接日本來訊、悉日本報紙對彼等一行訪</p>
<p>法西斯國</p>
<p>東京、大爲　視、東京各報明白指稱、此行「將鞏固軸心」「國間之互助」訊兩金融家將在柏林簽訂之商約、預料其結果將增加德日商業、查該商的之談判、係駐德日大使館商務參贊於—八個月前開始者、三月間已商得初步妥洽然因陸軍反對輸人所　罪必要一德貨、談判</p>
<p>乃受挫折</p>
<p>今陸軍似已不加反對、據東京傳來私人消息稱、日本輸入之德貨、大半將屬軍器、允以大砲與飛機爲多、目前日本至少於表面上由防共公的與文化協定而與德意相連絡、而新協定將以遠大之軍事與海軍諒解聯繫此三國家、寺內等三代表昨晨登出雲艦舫駐鞏日本総隊總司令及川中將、駐滬日領署及陸海軍當局亦分別設宴招待、</p>
<h3>甬港婦孺出口限制　較前寬弛</h3>
<p>壯丁出口仍予嚴禁　注重手續不限人數</p>
<p>滬甬航行、改由鎭海口外起卸客貨後、頗爲順利、德商　和洋行謀福綸、第三次航行週甬綫、始於昨晨離鎭海返滬、今晚到滬、據禮和船部息、該輪擬定後晨即續航鎭海、目前甬防部對於旅客出入、除出口壯丁仍屬嚴禁外、餘者已較前寬限、故行駛滬甬綫各航輪、此後對由滬赴甬之搭客、如手續具備、人數將不加限制、禮和洋行海福輪、前載溫州同鄕赴沙堤、因中途遇風、在溫州洋面停留兩日、己於前晨返滬、該輪駛沙埕時、會附載少數貨物前往、及抵沙埕、因日艦阻撓航行、所有客貨均未能起卸、故已原輪運載返滬、該輪預定常川行駛沙埕之計劃、亦已中止、</p>
<h3>政府決以全力　維持滬巿法幣　匯巿劇變係投機者操縱　可能範圍內仍酌予維持</h3>
<p>財政部公佈禁止進口貨物辦法、出口貨物結匯領取匯價差額辦法、及進口貨物申請購買外匯規則、旨在限制奢侈品及非必需品之進口、鼓勵主要土貨之輸出、並決以全力維持法幣價値、儘量供給法定外匯、關於淪陷區域之上海、因政府權力所不及、致投機者操縱壟斷、發生外滙黃金等暗市劇烈變動、以及匯劃貼水之不正當營業、今對於淪陷區域之法幣行使、已有充分之準備、切實予以維持、惟上海黑巿之外匯、仍暫由平準委會於可能範圍內酌予維持、必要時決予中止、因與中國抗戰有損無益、茲誌上海金融巿塲情形如下、</p>
<p>外匯趨穩　投機套利</p>
<p>上海黑市外匯、經維持後、巳趨穩定、昨晨匯豐銀行掛牌、英匯四辦士、美匯七元七五、依然如舊、並無變動、日商各行雖繼續扒進、幸經香港之維持、故實際行市尙稱穩定、英滙四辦士半、美匯八元七五、惟遠期近期之套利、昨晨竟達加一、即十元能套利一元、有實力者均營此套利投機、</p>
<p>證劵暗巿　一致高漲</p>
<p>證劵暗巿因各方證實統一公債七月底到期之本息、雖財政部聲明停止付款、而中中交農四行允予貼現抵借、因此暗市回漲、昨日上午收盤、統一甲種五十一元九角、漲一元三角、乙種四十三元三角、漲一元　角五分、丙種四十二元、漲八角五分、丁種四十一元、漲八角、戊種四十一元五角五分、漲七角、</p>
<p>黃金漸平　貼水回降</p>
<p>黃金暗盤集會處昨晨開做後、價格上落仍劇、上午收盤爲三千五百七十元、比較前日上午收盤跌三十元、下午收盤爲三千六百七十元、比較前日下午收盤高一百二十元、銀樓大同行掛牌上午三百五十五元、下午爲三百七十元、至於匯劃貼水、昨日爲二百二十元至二百三十元之間、</p>
<h3>巿銀行存款　開始發還</h3>
<p>上海銀行業聯合準備會票據交援所、受上海市銀行及上海市　業信託社之委託、代理該行社發還存款、有三千三百餘戶之多、現大部份存戶、巳向該所登記竣事、自七月二十一日起、已山該所開始付款、所有存款本息、均付法幣、且各項存款、結算利息、仍感優厚、存戶方面、並不吃虧、惟該行社理監事會前奉財政部核定、凡三百元以上之存款、須按照安定金融辦法分期發還、三百元以下之存軟、則一次發還、故該所祇能嚴格核付、惟據該所職員謂、市銀行及興業信託社數千存戶、其中以小額儲蓄存款居多、故大多均能一次付淸、</p>
<h3>人力車夫同人會　要求核减車租</h3>
<p>本市各區人力車夫代表所組織之「上海市人力車夫同人會」、為反對車商違法私增車租、並要求實行减租三成、以及廢除車夫登記「申請書」事、特於昨晨九時、推派代表四人、携同呈文、向三馬路江西路工部局董事會請願、</p>

<p>致就任詞</p>
<p>赫脫司令致就任詞云、雅納爾將軍任亞洲艦隊總司令、行將兩載於茲、雅司令在任期內、以其英俊堅韌之精神與毅力、應付於亞洲艦隊服務上、彌足欽佩、當茲雅司令行將離滬之前、余敢以同僚與友誼之地位、掬誠向雅司令吿、余仍將賡續雅司令之計劃、向前邁進、務使無愧吾人軍人之職守而後已、</p>

<p>雅氏歸國</p>
<p>雅納爾上將卸任後、在滬約　尙有一　之居留、俾整理行裝、與友輩話別、定八月二日携脊乘柯立芝總統號離滬返美　謁維斯福總統述職、羅斯福總統對雅氏頗爲倚重、傳將畀以菲律濱高級專員之職、以代麥克納特之缺、一說雅氏將暫調華盛頓海軍部服務、赫脫司令將俟送行雅納爾赴美後、即將乘奧古斯泰號旗艦赴華北、作就任後之首次巡視、</p>

<h3>市場提早收市　米市發生暗盤　市塲混亂囤戶毫不顧及　當局派員到塲切實曉諭</h3>
<p>米市因囤戶扒進、業外人投機操縱、對購進之貨、堅持不允出售、以致交易混亂、中次各米一律漲至現價、實與租界當局規定之中决照別原則不符、頂特　號各米市塲絕跡、並發生暗盤交易、但經營暗盤交易者、完全私相授受、並無成交單據、旨在避免當局之處罰、昨晨九時、上海豆米行業公會之福州路米業市塲、開市後、人　擠擠、喧囂甚烈、全塲充滿扒進之喊聲、昨晨市價趨高、成交之數、僅及平時十分之二三、幾有行無市、市塲陷於停頓狀態、經管委會全體人員分頭勸導、囤戶方面、安之若素、無動於中、致市塲被迫、提早收市、</p>
<p>門市零糶　統一售價</p>
<p>據大光社記者探悉、本市米號業公會因鑒於滬米市塲之交易市價、已超越最高限之數、致無法購買、現各米店門市零糶之米、其價格與市場購進時頓同、如門市售價增高、則影響民食、過低則成本虧折、故該業公會為顧及平民生計起見、除將現在市情形報告租界當局、迅予糾正外、復對同業會員各米號之門市零糶、別其米類之好次、統一售價至軍力佣金等、則仍包括在內、以維營業、</p>
<p>租界當局　到塲說明</p>
<p>公共租界工部局自規定國米限價後、即最高白粳不得超過二十元、最高客秈不得超過十六元、今鑒於市塲米價飛漲、除派員嚴行澈查、並准無論何人隨時據實舉發、以憑取締究辦外、於昨日上午十一時、派員赴市塲、向一百零五家行號、說明當局限價之意義、並望米商一致遵守、</p>
<p>皖省禁運　江設暢通</p>
<p>昨日運抵上海之米（一）河下來船的有十餘艘、（二）火車運來五六車、（三）輪船裝到三千餘包、總計的有五千包左右、惟蕪湖秈客因日方阻撓、不允發給搬出證、雖經米商一再交涉、迄今仍未解決、所以由蕪湖運抵滬之米巳絕跡、惟上海整個民食、雖存底略减、而新米登塲期近、不致發生缺乏恐慌、</p>
<h3>京滬綫華軍反攻　情勢驟趨緊張　錫常一帶戰事頗烈　公路交通已受阻梗</h3>
<p>自京滬鐵路綫一帶之游擊軍、經東戰塲軍事主管當局積極配備以來、訓練精壯、淘汰老弱、並協助民衆、澈底肅淸匪藪工作、在沿綫附近各縣區內、大爲活躍、故引起日方極度不安、連日調動頻繁、加緊護路力量、各縣留防城鄕之日軍、因兵員不够支配、城門入晚即行關閉、</p>
<p>各路聯合進行反攻</p>
<p>担任無錫蘇州常熟太倉崑山靑浦之反攻部隊、其人數達四萬餘人、由梅光迪朱壽華任天石王士來等統率各路華軍、現由江游擊軍總指揮鄧木殷指揮、巳於本月二十三日起開始反攻、戰事頗爲劇烈，錫常太三縣進展至速、其華軍先遺突擊隊、進抵距離城區四五里之週圍佈防、俟與後方部隊呼應後、再作攻城計畫、現城廂內外、已發現華軍標語、日僞軍驚惶萬分、</p>
<p>交通阻塞　商業蕭條</p>
<p>沿綫各縣發生軍事行動後、交通上驟吿阻塞、而允以錫滬公路、自常熟之白茆站起、直至無錫之羊尖站止、及靑崑公路一帶交通、時遭阻斷、來往載運商貨之汽車、運輸公司均相繼停駛、而日商方面客貨各車、亦縮短程站、大部份改爲水路裝運、內地因情勢嚴重、居民紛紛遷避、商業異常蕭條、所有在滬已訂各貨、均通知暫緩裝出、</p>
<h3>蘇北新港　卽將克復</h3>
<p>蘇北來人談、月來蘇北遊擊隊配合正規軍、與日軍作戰、各處異常猛烈、連戰皆捷、先後克復漣水淮安等地、皆因李將軍日夜策劃、每戰必躬臨前綫指揮、故將士用命、屢奏奇功、近日爲邊實就虛、又轉戰沿江一帶、日軍兵力單薄、異常恐慌、華軍乘勝奪取各港口據點、所向披靡、新港為日軍所佔久矣、聞我軍現正積極推進中、</p>
<h3>津魯漢地名鈔票　收兌辦法實行　付給原地或重慶滙票　他埠法幣仍十足通用</h3>
<p>津魯漢地名之鈔票、經中交兩行總行指示收兌辨法後、中交兩滬分行、昨日起通吿遵辦、無論零數及整數、一律付給原發行地或重慶之即期匯票、並准持券人匯入內地採辦土貨、惟其他各地鈔票、一律照常通用、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>兩行通告　辦法兩項</p>
<p>中國交通兩銀行昨通告云、一奉總行示、對於敝行津魯漢三分行所發之鈔票、茲經核定照下列辦法辦理、（一）凡以中·交·津·魯地名及交行漢劵未兌者、一律以原發行地或以重慶付款之即期匯票付給（不取匯費）、（二）爲便利持票人向內地採辦士貨起見、並得人酌量免費收匯內地等因、自當遵照辦理、特此通告、民國二十八年七月二十五日一、</p>
<p>他埠鈔票　一律通用</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向中交兩行探悉、收兌津·魯·漢地名之鈔票、除中交兩上海分行外、本埠各支行或辦事處均一律收兌、惟限天津及魯省之山東·濟南·烟台·靑島·威海衛·以及漢口等地、至於江蘇·浙江·福建·以及其他外埠地名之鈔票、均得照常使用、不受上述二項辦法之限制、本埠各行莊對於津·魯·漢·地名以外之各地鈔票、亦十足收受通用，</p>
<p>南業銀行　鈔票辦法</p>
<p>各商業銀行所發行之鈔票、遭經發行準備管理委員會接收、（一）中央銀行接收者、爲四行之中南。中國農工·四明·等三行、（二）中國銀行接收者、中國通商·農商。等二行（三）通銀行接收者、浙江興業·中國墾業·中國實業。等三行、以上各行鈔票、仍准一律通用、惟津·魯漢。地名之鈔票、亦得向各接管之中中交三行請求收兌、辦法相同</p>
<p>浙地鈔票　十足行使</p>
<p>關於浙江地方銀行之杭州地名之鈔票、理應十足照常通用、自華北地名鈔票拒收後、該行鈔票、外界不明眞相、亦予拒收、新聲社記者昨向該行上海分行探悉、該行爲維持信用起見、已飭上海分行無限制儘量收兌、所以凡持票人如欲掉換上海地名之鈔票、可向江西路三八一號該分行申請據換、又該行之鈔票、本埠各銀行錢莊、一律收受、</p>
<p>各行接受　匯入內地</p>
<p>上海各銀行如新華等、均已收受華北地名及漢口之鈔票匯款、凡各業或個人欲匯款至內地者、均得以上述地名之鈔票、向各銀行匯入內地、如係向內地採辦土貨、亦得同樣辦理、此外並聞有若干小錢莊、竟乘機收受津。魯·漢·地鈔票、每元須貼水五分至二角不等、該小錢莊收得後、再掉給匯入內地、旨在牟利</p>
<p>實施之後　人心安定</p>
<p>中交兩行上海分行、昨晨仍有持外埠地名之鈔票請求兌換、該兩行除對津·魯·漢·地名依照總行指示之兩項辦法辦理外、其他各埠地名、仍予照兌、各持券人經兩行解釋後、均已深切諒解、改匯入內地、於是中·交·兩行昨日收入之內地匯款、較往日略增、並予優待免收匯費、上午時之後、巳無持券人請求兌換、足證人心已趨安定、</p>
<h3>襲擊報館案　日方所傅情報　竟謂係擁護重慶者所為　但又未能指陳具體證據</h3>
<p>字林報云、關於死四人、傷的二十人之愛多亞路槍擊案、日方發言人於昨日（二十四日）招待新聞記者席上發與報紙所傳相反之言、據稱、日當局所獲情報、襲擊報館者、乃擁　重慶之恐怖份子、企圖在英人佔勢力之工部局與日當局間造成摩擦、俾弛緩今在東京進行之圓滿談判、某記者詢、擁護重慶之恐怖份子襲擊熱烈擁護</p>
<p>重慶政府</p>
<p>之報紙、其目的何在、發言人答此事刻由警務處偵查中、然有謂該兩報之遭襲擊、乃因邇來减低其反日態度之結果、某記者遂指陳被襲兩報之一、接得擁護某團體發出之恐嚇信頗多、函中稱如不變更其態度、則將摧毀該報館、而該報刊載重慶當局之文後、不數日後即發生此暴行、另一記者詢日當局是吾認爲</p>
<p>此事重大</p>
<p>發言人答觀於盛傳華人刻擬暗殺駐華英大使寇爾、俾阻東京英日會議之圓滿結束、故此事重大、某記者詢、若得何證據、證明恐怖份子與某團體有關、則日當局將與警務處合作兜捕暴黨乎、發言人答、首先有證明之必要、如迭决陳述者、日軍當局對維持此間租界</p>
<p>和平秩序</p>
<p>深爲關切、若發現任何份子與日方此項政策背馳、而已證明其罪狀者、日方當然願合作撲減之、某記者詢關於恐怖份子係由中政府指使一說、發言有更具體之情報乎、發言人答、君亦詢警務處自何處獲其情報乎、或詢問題中之恐怖份子匿跡於億定盤路旁之召軍控制區、</p>
<p>此項事實</p>
<p>日當局知吾、發言人答不知、並吾詔公共租界當局巳與日當局商議兜捕匿跡「大道」區中之持械暴徒、或詢、七月二日持械暴徒在億定盤路槍擊巡捕搜查隊、翌日日憲兵隊與警務處不曾舉行會談乎、發言人答、日當局得此會談事之報吿、某記者詢、愛多亞路槍擊案之重大、足使日方實行其參加維持公共租界的和平與秩序之政策乎、發言人答、於此層意義方面、是案並不重大、然其技節問題、尙未明瞭、</p>

<h3>垃圾運赴閘北　人車突遭扣留　工部局應日方之請運往塡地　被偽方下直接命令扣留未釋　英領耍求釋放被扣西籍職工</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局工務處應日本海軍陸戰隊之請、昨日（廿四日）派出工作隊一大隊、計卡車二十八輛、私人汽車一輛、載公共祖界之垃圾、駛往閘北塡塞低窪之地、傍晚之前、突遭「市長」傳筱庵下令扣留、諸人被扣於「上海特別市府」之江灣警察局、內有監工英人羅斯、德人白魯特、及租用卡車之白俄司機一人、各車則被扣於八字橋、至今（廿五日）晨仍被扣留中、整個</p>
<p>事件背景</p>
<p>乃「特別市府」要求納費、工部局人員得日本陸戰隊軍官之助、昨夜進行談判、俾使諸人釋出、查公共租界垃圾塡塞低窪之地、行之已歴有多月、自江灣越鐵路綫而入虹口公園處之低地、即其中之一、工部局前向上海市政府每年繳費十二萬元、有將一部份垃圾傾入浦江之特樣、自市政府遷移、工部局即</p>
<p>不繳此費</p>
<p>然兩週以前、傳提出要求、不僅耍索此費、且索已往兩年中之「欠款」、故工務處停止傾倒垃圾於浦江、今羅斯諸人雖係代日本陸戰隊工作、而仍被扣、乃「特別市府」故意之舉動、以圖向工部局勒索此二十四萬元、被扣車輛、計有工務處卡車十二輛、租用卡車十六輛、及私人汽車一輛、各軍發動引擎之鑰、昨</p>
<p>已被取去</p>
<p>英領事吉特遜今日因羅斯被非法扣留事、向日總領事抗議、以期立即使羅斯得釋、聞以垃圾塡塞低窪之地、乃極安全與衛生之舉、已往十五年、工部局向應地主之請而出此、吾則地主不得不購汚泥塡塞之、近兆豐公園中大批假山、亦以此法疊成、工務處對</p>
<p>塡塞之用</p>
<p>的垃圾、混以汚泥與紗廠中塵芥合成之厚漿、此漿可防虫類及其幼蟲逸出、傾入低地後、漿下熱度、不特可殺虫顚、及其幼虫、眞可滅徽舊、故若以為垃圾僅領諸地上、而蠅虫　集、則究全誒矣、</p>

<h3>科學與民族之解放</h3>
<p>— 禾山</p>
<p>歐洲之中古時代，一黑暗時期也。當其時暴君污吏，軍閥地主，橫行魚肉其人民，而其宗敎之專橫，允足使社會奄奄一息，毫無生氣。凡讀歐洲中世紀歷史者，無不悉其人民日在水深火熱之中，其痛苦已非人類所能受。自哥白尼氏出，發見天體之系統，伽利略氏繼之，字宙所有物理上之現象，因之日明。歐洲人民之思想，於此丕變。宗敎之迷信，君主之威力，皆不足以束縛之。於是自由平等之說興，歐洲各國遂日有革新之趨勢。故其後盧梭，孟德斯鳩，等鼓吹革命而成功，實由哥，伽諸人造其基也。迨牛頓，達爾文，諸人應運而生，深思精研，著書牑世，全世界人民幾無不受其影響。如質力名數諸學旣已大明，利用厚生之事業，亦隨之而促進。而物競天擇，適者生存之學說，尤深入人心。使得眞確之人生觀，日日奮鬥於進化之途徑，而不敢稍懈。故覘國勢者恒謂一國之興衰，可由其國內科學家之努力何如而定之。法國當巴斯德之努力研究，實與有力焉。英國於十九世紀之中，盡革中古敎育之舊制，使全國盡行科學化，赫胥黎之鼓吹科學敎育，實居首功焉。德國蘇俄，皆於國家破碎之餘，在較短時期中崛起勃興，其勢力足以左右一世者，共國內無數專家，出死力以科學救國，實有以致之。故凡一民族欲久存於世，發榮滋長，不爲他族所征服者，必恃其國民努力於科學。吾國今日當此危急存亡之秋，欲抵抗强敵，保存國土主權，爲永久獨立之民族，端賴有志愛國之士，各竭心力，從事於科學之發展。</p>
<h3>金屬與植物</h3>
<p>— 心善</p>
<p>在百五十年以前，歐美已有人爲了要明瞭植物的生長方法，而注意到存在於土壤中的金屬。實際上，不但土壤中含有許多金屬，就是植物的本身和果子中，也含有微量的金屬。不過這種金屬，都不能單獨存在，只能與其他元素成爲各種化合物，如氣化物，硫酸鹽，燐酸鹽等。並且植物只能利用溶解於水的金屬化合物，以收新陳代謝之功。</p>
<p>以前大家都以爲植物自萌芽而至成熟，只須碳，氫，氧，氮，燐，鉀，鈣，鎂，硫，鐵十種元素已足。後經進一步的精密研究，才知帮助植物生長的，至少還需耍適當微量的錳，銅，鋅，硼，鋇，　，碘，砒等八種元素，惟如逾量，均反於植物有害，或竟使植物枯萎而死。</p>
<p>如将一種蟲膠樹液燒得的灰，加以分析，就知灰中竟含有百分之二·五的錳。如以含有十萬分之一的硫酸錳溶液，作爲大麥的試用肥料，麥苗就會長得特別茂盛。如將錳質液局部的灑在植物種子的殼皮上，其胚胎就會生得特別充實。又如將稻，小麥，雀麥，黃豆，豌豆，番柿，玉葱，胡瓜，菠菜萵苣等植物，完全用不含錳質的泥土和肥料來栽培，那麼勢必枝葉萎黃，毫無生氣。由此我們就會相信植物的葉綠素中，及植物種子外表的殼皮和內藏的胚胎中，都缺不得適量的錳質。</p>
<p>銅，砒，鋅對於植物之生長，也有顯著的帮助：如將銅質液噴射到番薯的枝葉上面去，則可殺除害蟲，並能增益番薯的質量。如砒質則能增加安化，硝化，和氧化的徽菌的活動力，而使地盡其利。至於砒酸鈣等復可用以毒殺蛀子蟲和食葉蟲。又如各種鋅化合物，雖皆具毒性，但有幾種却能加速硝化作用，而使農作物的收護量大大增加。</p>
<p>不少人正在繼續硏究，研究範圍，的可分爲三類：即土壤與植物之分析，植物生長之科學管理，及植物病之防止與醫治是。他日如有驚人成就，則其造福人類，當匪淺鮮。因爲這樣我們就可在農業和園藝方面，使植物的品質改良，產量增多，而蔬菜，菓子，米麥等物，皆可以廉價得之；同時在工程和工業方面，則可加速木材之生長，增加原料之供給，並爲燃料另闢一新產源。</p>

<p>往年僑寓金陵，殘臘將盡，家人忙於渡歲，一夕寢息較遲，忽客室中微聞呻吟之聲，甚悽慘，然注意聽之，卽不復聞。而傾聽稍懈，其聲又作。家人懼，疑爲鬼祟，余明知其非是，而亦無以知其所從來，乃持電筒於室內各處尋察，几案臥榻，無所不搜。旋於庭中室後，盡力探索，亦無蹤影，又疑牆外或有丐者病臥，外出四處覓之，仍不見有朕兆。觀察之術旣窮，此惑竟不得解，有疑地下或有古墳，鬼聲乃從發出者。而闕地及泉，殊非易易，且時已夜深，不得不歸寢矣。决晨拂拭桌案，偶引其屜，忽復聞其聲，審視之，家中所畜之老貓，臥於桌膛之內，昨夜鬼聲，卽共所作也。蓋此屜爲小兒携玩，貓藏息桌中，家人將屜插還原處，此貓旣老且病，囚閉不得出，遂有苦鬱之聲，天下所有奇異現象，若未能窮其究竟，輒疑爲鬼魔者，母乃皆此類乎！</p>
<h3>「火罐」治療重傷風</h3>
<p>— 培生</p>
<p>中國土法用火罐吸在額上，據云可治頭痛。用小瓷罐一，燒一紙條入之，火未全滅時，即以罐口按於額上，稍待即吸住。蓋以罐內空氣被執所驅出，壓力减小，因此罐外大氣壓將罐壓於額上而罐不跌落。又因血壓將額上皮肉推入罐中，故將罐取去時，額上現出紅圓，蓋因血液流通所致。</p>
<p>此一方法，現爲土耳其浴所採取，以療治重傷風，其目的在增加血液之環流。此法將衆多小玻璃罐吸在患者之背上，如圖所示，先將罐在酒精燈上加熱，使罐內氣壓减低，而後一一合在背上，由吸取作用將血液吸至表皮。罐取去後，現有紅痕，根使用此法，絕無痛苦。</p>

<h3>銜頭</h3>
<p>— 莫邪</p>
<p>店鋪所倚賴的是招牌，個人所倚賴的，除了排塲之外，就是銜頭了。招牌以老爲貴，銜頭自然以大爲貴。只要銜頭大，用不着什麼眞實本領，就可以嚇倒人，正如店鋪只要招牌老，不管你賣些什麼，或者怎樣賣，別人就可以相信你的貨眞價實。這差不多已經成了通例，用不着我的多說。</p>
<p>然而據我所知，正如招牌有時也會以新爲貴，銜頭有時也會於大之外，以長爲貴，以闊爲貴，……爲要服從科學精神，不再空口說白話，謹檢出證據如下：</p>
<p>訃文或喪牌上，往往有這樣的格式：「……××大學×學士，××中學畢業生，××小學畢業生。」在這種細大不捐的學歴之上，自然還有細大不捐的官歷，甚至可由「太子太傳」到「××巡檢」。階級愈高，愈放在前面；而高的階級，却都是後來的事情，所以形成了眞正的「後來居上」。這是銜頭中之以長爲貴的。</p>
<p>我們也時常可以看到一種名片，在他的大名左右，排列着許多職銜，例如：「××社社長，××公司交際員，××會幹事，××小學敎務主任，××實業公司經理，××書局編輯，××商塲招待員，……」這眞是「闊」了！因爲並排起來，非「闊」不可！</p>
<p>不過長的或闊的銜頭，不是人人所易有的，熱中於銜頭者，或者有所利用於銜頭者，到底還得另想別法才行。別法誰何？曰借！</p>
<p>據說：從前有一位宰相的遠房子弟，在蘇州遊玩，到處題壁曰：「大丞相再從姪××嘗遊。」有一位滑稽之士呌李璋的，就在他的旁邊題着說：「混元皇帝三十七代孫李璋繼至。」這可以說是善於借的了。同樣：「文華殿大學士，協辦大學士，戶部尙書……王文韶對門豆腐店老板娘王阿嬭之喪」，將王文韶的官銜用了一大串，也就可以說極盡惜之能事了。至於從前在婚喪中借用親戚故舊的銜牌，排在前面耀武揚威，似乎此風到現在還沒有完全消滅。</p>
<p>但是「久假而不歸，安知共非有也？」借來之物，到底不是自己的，在心理上總有些不痛快，於是熱中於頭銜者，或者有所利用於頭銜者，又想出了買的一法來。</p>
<p>在從前，只要你肯用功讀書，有眞才實學，任你是阿貓阿狗，都可以考得秀才，舉人，進士，翰林。現在則不然，一個孩子要獲得小學畢業生的銜頭，就須化上幾百元的學費，這孩子的用功與才學，是沒有多大關係的。依此類推，由小學畢業生以至大學畢業稱學士，莫不省然，而所費的錢則愈後愈多。至於出洋留學，得洋傳士以歸，那就完全是錢的力量了。我說這些什麼士什麽士的銜頭，都是買來的，並不算是故甚其辭吧？况且歷古以來，就有損銜頭之例；捐者，亦是出錢也，與買無異，那未我說的買，其實也不過捐之意云爾。</p>
<p>不過長的或闊的銜頭，也總是越大越好，而出之於借或買，那當然也是爲了求銜頭之大，所以銜頭以大爲貴，到底是跌撲不破的眞理，有些人爲了要銜頭大，在上述種種方法以外，還不惜出於造也就更不足怪了：</p>
<p>醫師稱博士，烟紙店的老板稱百貨公司的經理；保險公司的跑街，也是經理；汽油公司分站的「軋司令僕歐」，也是經理；剃頭店老板是經理：浴室裏的擦背老大是主任；鶏鴨行老板是行長……</p>
<p>爲什麼大家都喜歡銜頭呢？原來銜頭和排塲一樣，實在有種種好處，難怪人人欲得而甘心。且排塲是使人見的，銜頭是使人聽的，見者少而聽者多，見者近而聽者遠，排塲自然不及銜頭好。一個人在生前有了大銜頭，一經宣傳，就可以先聲奪人，使人敬畏愛惜，死後更可以大之登入史傳，小之載入宗譜，流芳百世。若說招牌的好處有利，那未銜頭的好處就純粹有名。名至利歸，當然是常事，再好也沒有。人生一世，誰叉不是爲名爲利！</p>
<p>做了皇帝還喜歡某種銜頭，也可見銜頭的入人之深了，例如：唐宣宗自稱「鄉貢進士李道龍」，宋徽宗自稱「道德眞君」，明武宗自稱「神武大將軍」之類。因此，我也很喜歡銜頭。但是我沒有什麽出身，此處旣沒有地方可借，又沒有錢可買，更不會造，只好自上尊號曰中華民國「老百姓」，聊以自娛云。</p>
<h3>美加兩國間不設邊防</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>——國際親善的模範</p>
<p>在今日大衆注重馬奇諾防綫和西格弗利防錢的當兒，忽發現一處長逾三千哩而絕沒有一座堡壘，或砲位的邊界，眞能呌人精神奮發，這便是美國和加拿大間的邊界，也是兩大民治國的常識紀念物。</p>
<p>這邊界東起紐白侖斯惠克，沿着聖勞侖斯河的一部份而進，除密歇根湖以外，它經過所有的大湖沼，貫穿大草原，越過洛幾斯和錫埃拉納伐達多山區，西達溫哥武爲止，在許多比較荒野的地段，竟沒有一根鐵絲，用來表明加拿大領土的盡頭，和美國土地起始的邊錢。</p>
<p>這偉大的邊界雖沒用軍事方法來防衛，但時常巡邏着，其數不過三千人似乎不算多。為要阻止私運，和防杜非法入境，巡　是必要的。美國和加拿大誰都不要對方的「不良份子」入境，但只須出示正當的證件，沒有可疑的形跡，人民從美國或是加拿大經過邊界而到對方，並沒有困難。有些地方，幾千百個人每天來往，經過邊界去做工作，當局用有效期長久的通行證供給他們，工人閃只須出示通行證，就像火車站上執月季票的人一樣就可通過。在底德律萬千處加拿大人，在美國汽車廠裹工作的，都乘渡輪經過邊界。</p>
<p>在世界大不景氣的時候，許多人都試從邊界的這面，非法越界而到那面。當時，加拿大人和美國人都認為「彼面」比較本國容易發展，於是巡邏員便採用特殊的盤詰技巧，難得查不出非法入境的。例如，一個加拿大人耍說他是美國人，巡邏員便問他本市市長的姓名等類的問題，也許還會突然地問，你穿的衣服那裏買來的。假如回答設是紐的，巡邏員便會翻轉那人的後領，看店標上的成衣店名稱，如果上面是加拿大成衣店的出品，巡邏員就把這人逐回。</p>
<p>有一處常有人試圖越界的，便是奈亞加拉河上著名的和平橋。那裏不時有人說他們是美國人回本國去，而得到准許，走進那橋標的加拿大方面的盡頭。但走到另一端的美國當局跟前，便拒絕他們入境。這些人當然不准立即回加拿大，而只得留在橋上。會有一次，這種人們在橋上逗留了幾天，進退不得，友好們携食物送給他們。最後，兩當局對於不能確知他們祖先的人們，忽然想到了丟銅元的意見。鑒如，加拿大方面說：「丟着正面，那人是我們的，丟着反面，那人是你們的，」就這樣來決定那個人的國籍。</p>
<p>乘火車或是汽車旅行的游客，遇不到這種掃興的手續。關卡當局對於迅速檢查汽車是老手，讓汽車在反射鏡上駛看車底並沒縛着箱篋就算了。在火車上進行的檢查手續，也很便利，那些從紐約乘火車，取道奈亞加拉，而到芝加哥去的人們，允其簡便事實上道種火車多數停在便利的地點受檢查，而乘客就有一刻鐘左右的時間欣賞當地的瀑布。</p>
<p>西部有些地方有畜牧塲橫跨着邊界，塲裏的人每天可經過邊界，來往一二十次。在洛幾斯和錫埃拉，有幽深的峽谷，行人不通，做天然的障碍物。還有孤獨的邊界上高山，從沒有攀山人的足跡到過，巡邏員更不必說了。</p>
<p>時常有人建議說，加拿大應該和美國聯合，例如兩年前美國就有人向衆院提出這麼一件決議案。然而兩國是如此的和睦相處，絕少摩擦，這種建議，是引不起雙方的一綫興趣的。（譯紐的晚快報）</p>
<h3>山西大哥在望哨</h3>
<h3>還是樂觀</h3>
<p>— 智</p>
<p>悲觀只會敗壞事情，不會成就事情，還是樂觀好。因爲樂觀能够鼓動精神，加增勇氣，生出智力和體力來，遠非悲觀那樣的腐蝕人心，使人沮喪，退縮，一無所用，可比。</p>
<p>在風平浪靜的時候，固然應該樂觀，不應該無病呻吟，妄自悲觀。然而在風波險惡的時候，却允其應該樂觀，絕對不應該悲觀。只有樂覜，才能救人脫離險境，達到目的地。悲觀？根本沒有這會事！</p>
<p>我們一向是樂觀的，這呌我更加一向樂觀着。現在，似乎有一些意外的打擊，臨到我們的身上，我知道一定有許多人，不免喪失了他們樂觀的勇氣，而轉入悲觀的陷穽。我要對他們大聲疾呼說：不要悲觀，還是樂觀！</p>
<p>在這些小小打擊之下，當然悲觀是無用的。我們如果不願意作亡國奴，被人宰割，自然還是要奮鬥，要努力，來達到我們建設自由平等的國家的大目的。只有樂觀，以這些打擊爲不足輕重，爲人生，不，爲國家建設的過程上，難免的挫折。我們有我們的目的，我們的辦法我們有决心，有確信，任何打擊，我們都不怕，都可以克服。</p>
<p>何况現在的打擊，還不能算作打擊，一則影饗很小，二則眞相未見淸楚。何况現在的國際局勢，複雜非常，失之「東隅」的，正可以收之桑榆；俗說「此處不留人，自有留人處，」我說，「此處不助人，自有助人處，」說得明白些：「此人不帮我，自有帮我者。」兩方面看來，我們有什麼可以悲觀的地方呢？耍悲觀，還不是杞人憂天！</p>
<p>退一萬步說，假使我們终於要失敗的，滅亡的，我也願意大家光榮地，不愧爲人地，帶着笑容，流出我們最後一滴血！我們決不悲觀！</p>
<p>然而只要我們人人肯流出最後一滴血，我們决不會失敗，决不會滅亡。我願大家挺起胸脯來，長長地吸一口氣，仍然奮鬥下去，努力下！</p>
<p>還是樂觀！在我們每一個人的心上要有這樣的堅定！</p>
<h3>簷溜</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>言行</p>
<p>是有這麼樣的一個時候，也不妨設是羅亭的時代，言語，漂亮的言語，有了高貴的意養。滔滔的雄辯和驚人的說辭似乎就是代表一切了。</p>
<p>行動遂成為微不足道，言之無須顧行也像是理所當然。於是，整天祇感到宏論洋洋乎盈耳不寂寞倒是眞的，但也終不免不舒服。</p>
<p>然而我說，在事實的面前言語是一種多餘的存在——自然這也不過是一句老話的新說法而已。</p>
<p>眼前是這樣的一個時代：行動的時代。我們要求切實一點。少空口說白話，還是多拿出些自己有的那份力量吧！每一個人耍用那雙手來支持這苦難的民族，「有一分熱，發一分光。」縱然微薄，却是切實的。</p>

<h3>紗花　小布廠紛紛停閉　紗市難期振作</h3>
<p>紗市稍帶軟化、實則價格巳入高境、消化僅恃準南一路、除此之外、絕少發展希望、查其原因、一半謂金融緊縮、銀根日見抽緊、二則內地之款、嚴厲取締、不許匯達淪陷區中、就此而論、往後之籌碼無鬆懈希望、一半布疋銷路狹隘、將紗織成了布、非但不能盈利、反有虧耗、因此布廠閉門停工之聲浪、甚囂塵上、</p>

<h3>呢絨花色之變遷　厭舊喜新……久用即爲過時　時新花樣……大抵老式翻新</h3>
<p>呢絨毛織物，近年來的風行，眞是與日俱增。其花色的變遷和到銷不同，一起一落，實在不勝　述，筆者想到與該業的買賣和定貨方面，頗有關係，特搜羅一些實在的陳跡，來篆敘一番，質　於各界。</p>
<p>當民國七八年時候，呢絨大路營業，似雨後春筍一般，做大衣的黃綠夾呢和印花呢，非常廣銷，華南華北客帮，購辦允力。夾呢以榮泰及喊喱二行最爲馳名，印花呢以和記雙色案牌子最老，後因歐洲大戰發生，各貨均不能如期定到，英滙在升到八九先令，海上呢絨行號二方，虧蝕倒閉，待風潮過後，花色到銷巳行變遷矣。這時大衣呢是風行五彩，好華牌最爲尊貴，安利蘆花蕩决之；同時麥爾登甚暢銷，德記杜蘭香首屈一指。絨類如黑搶·黃搶·銀搶·紫貂·豹皮·長毛·黃黑獺絨·大小海虎絨·雙面黃駝絨的盛銷。雙面黃駱駝絨，以荣泰招親圖和德記洋行的借東風二種牌子爲優。珠呢雲頭呢到銷之暢旺，北帮因地氣較南方爲冷，致中裝大衣盛行，極爲風行一時。</p>
<p>民國十六年北伐統一，厚呢盛行大方格和素色，薄呢盛行夾色和方格華特呢。毡呢風行，本客鞋帮大有需要。元直貢呢其時以榮泰一五三三〇及和豐二一一二七與德記一三三六，同安利聚寳盆公益金寳塔等牌子，悉都馳名廣銷，顏色方面，合銷華服衣料者，多盛行藍灰顏色；外國紅與香灰雜色，亦曾一度盛行，不果走銷遠不若藍色爲盛耳。後忽盛行墨綠與鼻烟色，鼻烟色風行時日，較其他顏色爲長久。同時馬褂料淘汰，馬褂呢。雪花呢。直貢呢，市銷銳减。十八年份起新到馬褲呢非常盛行，（按馬褲呢早年拆貨帮巳有到銷，是專供做跑馬褲之用，故名馬褲呢，現在大路帮翻新推廣爲夾大衣料，）華服大衣均趨之若驚，因質經策春秋多冬三季可穿，隨造成厚呢大衣之到銷銳减。其時國產寬緊駱駝絨發行，以維一和緯綸最先，於是一般絨類搶獺海虎豹皮等；漸相繼落伍而絕跡。波蘭平厚呢突見暢銷，蓋爲軍裝號衣之需要，黃色嗶嘰到銷轉廣。斯時呢絨花色變遷者，又有閃色華特呢，人字小格嗶嘰，團花灰直　，小帽花呢，格子爛糊花呢等亦極盛行。落伍滯銷者爲什色嗶　，珠呢方格華特呢方格大衣呢等是也。</p>
<p>民國二十年以後，女色大衣風行，致什色女大衣呢，到銷驟盛，華服衣料不論顏色花樣，均少變遷，惟廉價的劣貨，亦充斥於市，顧客貪價賤有購之，西貨大路嗶嘰和袍料花呢，因之到銷步跌。共又有不同者，寬緊駱駝絨，國產紗毛背出品，巳見精良，織造大增，價比舶來品爲廉，顧客歡迎，市塲全被我所奪回。（近年巳見進口絕跡）馬鬃袖裏和羽紗幷黑炭襯，到銷亦見大减。因絲光羽紗發明，極爲旺銷，馬鬃袖裹亦有出品，黑炭襯有寗波姜山馬尾襯可代替，以致進口均减少一半。「一二八」後穿西裝者如風起雲湧，本客埠西服店的開設，無年無月，不斷增加。西裝料花樣變遷者，有新的漢立蒙·派力司·凡而丁·人字毛花呢·白帆布·海立司等·花色則倏行柳條·大格·中格·小格·素色·人字·板四·斜花等靡定。因西裝花呢，花樣異常之衆，大半由主顧指選。</p>
<p>邇年來呢絨的變遷盛行，顏色方面，如繁銷者有華服料的元·常·灰·駝·夾色，西裝料多一個菜綠色。花樣方面，花呢最盛行爲柳條，决之爲細格子，餘均視混合配織得宜，不大鮮明，大方雅觀爲佳耳。華特呢，袍料盛行夾色，西裝套頭盛行藏靑，軍　界盛行黃色，素嗶嘰盛行元藏，花呢除大方格粗花紋外，以細巧淸楚爲上乘，女大衣料其最時行者爲海白龍螺絲絨二種，西裝料則以呢邊有西文字的爲風行，夾大衣料以馬褲呢駝斯錦爲盛行。西裝大衣，春秋風行火姆四本和海力斯，冬季厚呢以元重灰素頭髮呢爲大方，夏季自以法蘭絨羽紗呢，胖皮取巴勒呢，白嗶嘰·白直貢·蔴膠布·白帆布爲普及。雨衣布始終盛銷元藏灰單面開水米云。</p>

<h3>上海兒童醫院成立</h3>
<p>— （一粟）</p>
<p>為貧病兒童造福功德無量　望各界踴躍慨認免費床位</p>
<p>上海耆創的兒童醫院於前日（二十四日）成立了。在慕爾嗚路福煦路口的一座整潔淸靜，約有二十多個房間的洋房，就是它的院址。</p>
<p>它是從上海難民兒童醫院和威海衛路國際紅十字會嬰兒醫院合併蜕化而來。所以合併的緣故，據說，目前上海難民人數漸見减少，二院當局認爲可將二院合併，於五月曾開會議決成立新醫院，定名「上海兒童醫院」。它現在的院址，就是未合併前的上海難民兒童醫院。</p>
<p>筆者有位親戚張小姐在裏面担任醫師，蒙她引導依决的陪同參觀。頭等的病室置大小床各一隻，大床預備病孩的家長陪伴之用。參觀的這間頭等房並沒有病孩佔在裏面，僅在小床上放着一個洋囡囡，靠近的一張檯上，有洋房的木模型。像這樣的房間共五間，每一床位每天收費四元。參觀的那間二等房間內，大小床位各三，已爲病孩佔滿，並有家長在旁作伴。這種房間也有五個，每個收費二元。三等每間十個，每人每天一元。聞此項收費毫無利益，僅屬開支而巳。該院共有床位一百隻，免費床位八十個。此種免費床位由慈善團體，熱心人士所捐贈。捐贈滿一年者將芳名掛在床上。如紀念牛惠生醫師而捐贈者，牌上就刊着「紀念牛惠生醫師」字樣的克羅米字。</p>
<p>每一個病房，差不多已住滿了病孩。較大的六七歲，小的一二歲。初生的也有。</p>
<p>當走進生肺部病的一間，使筆者提出患傳染病者，爲何不將他們隔離的問語，張小姐便回答：「這裏傳染病是不收的，這是輕的肺部病。並指着一個病孩作例，那小孩的心生在右邊的……。」聽了這幾句，心裏便一寬。這許多病孩中不完全都是貧苦的，因爲經學大家唐文治的孫女兒正陲在二等房間的床位上哩。</p>
<p>該院對病孩的飲食方面，頗注意。常走進橱房問的門口，裏面一位管理的小姐帶着笑容，說着歡迎請進。灶具是利用電力的。食具如碗盞等物，非常淸潔齊整，並於牆上掛着記錄單和食譜等等。</p>
<p>張小姐引筆者到了X光錢室，便指着說：「這是X光錢機本來是同德醫院備的，價値七千元，由李雲山家屬吸其友人出資五千元向同德購來，爲紀念李君而捐贈本院。同德吃虧二千元，無形作了捐贈的意思。」手術室還沒有佈置完竣，室內的燈光炫耀的好像畫天，地上是舖着橡皮的。一切大小手術暫由顧問醫師施行，酌收手術費。參觀到門診室，知道每日下午一時至叫時應診，貧病和由收容所送去的病孩，予以施診，並且送贈藥物。其他門診病孩收費一角，配藥照本收費，在織物用品室外，張小姐說：「這裏圍放存衣着等物，由本院婦女贊助會捐助……。」</p>
<p>目前滬地難童還很多，在乍寒乍熱的天時中，病魔難免不降臨到他們身上，如不醫治，不免要葬送他們的生命、惟目前上海兒童醫院認免費床位，尙未滿額，渴望社會熱心人士多多踴躍慨認，嘉惠那般貧病兒童。</p>
<h3>虞山吳汀鷺先生近作</h3>
<h3>介紹一個「職工的津貼法」</h3>
<p>— 小職員</p>
<p>最近因上海米價的陡漲，一般居民都直接受到很大的影響，允其是薪水階級者。因此，如銀行及各大商店，對於職工都在設法津貼，但各有各的辦法，標準很不一致。這裏，我便想介紹一個比較合理的津貼法，給大家參考。</p>
<p>這是某大書局津貼職工的辦法：</p>
<p>（一）以新聞每日公布的最高米價為標準，如一個月內平均滿國幣十六元者，所有全體職工每人津貼國幣一元；滿十七元者，津貼二元：滿十八元者，津貼三元：其餘類推，練習生减半。</p>
<p>（二）如米價遂步回落，則津貼亦逐步减落，回至十六元以內時不貼。</p>
<p>（三）此項辦法，以一年爲限，自今年七月份起，至明年六月份止。</p>
<p>上述辦法，有下列數點是値得我們注意的</p>
<p>（一）部局原定最高米價爲十四元，已行了數年，所以超過一元時，影饗還小，可以不貼，但超過二元時（即至十六元），已開始感覺，所以開始津貼，這是很合理的。</p>
<p>（二）指定某報每日公布的最高米價爲標準，又以每月平均的米價來作津貼的標準，這是很科學化的；而且依照米價隨增隨减，這表明是眞正的津貼，並非變相的加薪，可以免去種種無謂的顧慮。</p>
<p>（三）對於全體職工，一律待遇，當然，薪水大的，津貼的比例小；薪水小的，津貼的比例大。（例如目前一百元者貼五元，只貼了百分之五；而二十元者也貼五元，就貼了百分之二十五。）「大有大難，小有小難。」高級職員於此似乎吃一點虧，但他們的日常生活，總還比較容易維持。所以這又是特別體諒低薪職工的辦法，允其是把工人也同等待遇，眞是難得！至於練習生，因爲年紀還小，尙未成家，所以减半，也很公允。</p>
<p>（四）這種辦法，以一年爲限，也很合理。因爲在這種年頭，瞬息萬變，將來的種種，誰也不能預料，所以還是一個限期辦法，似乎比較來得妥善。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回烟火千家鄕村合作波濤萬里瀛海飛行</p>
<p>爲甚麽說它是廢話呢？人家到中國來考察的，都是專家，我們怎麽可以把它一筆抹殺呢？不過所謂幾百年幾千年者，也要看世界以後用煤的情形如何？安知再過數十年以後，世界的燃料，發生一個大革命，於這些煤，不發生影響呢？現在有些科學家，正在日光裏想法子，不必要把礦洞裏的烏金一塊塊的發掘出來呀！到了公曆二千年的那一天，我們正不知道是什麼景象哪！不過在此刻，山西的煤，總算是用之不盡，取之不竭呢。國家所以要統制的，就因爲近年中國的煤，輸出很多。至於鄉村地方，現在還有燒山柴，茅草等天然燃料的，這是一任人民自由，不在統制之例了。今天何家兩位小姐，到鄉村來巡禮一回，覺得非常有興趣。她們從來不曾到過鄉村中來游玩的，况且這裹又是一個新村，她們覺得鄉村的趣味，比了都市更有意思哪。朱愛人也辭別了祖父和母親和何家姊妹。回到安樂鎭來。她們休息了一晚，明天就寫信給父親。把偕同愛人到自由村，謁見愛人的祖父未村長，同去相度廠址的事，詳細的稟吿父親。她們和父親商酌的是幾件事：一是造房子的事。因爲廠址旣已決定在自由村了，那就要預備建迭廠屋了。咋天朱村長引領她們去看的那塊地皮，就是一個水陸交通的地方。雖然說要經村議會通過以後，方能作爲決定，但這是沒有問題的事。關於建築廠屋的設計，却有種種的不同，一廠有一廠的式樣，一廠有一廠的時宜，一個機器廠，決不能與一個紡織廠，同樣的造法。因爲這都是在廠屋中，要安放機器的，所以廠屋與機器，却是大有關係。不過那些方式，當代的建築工程師，都有成竹在胸，一些兒也不曾差的。何家兩位小姐，不是早就說過，倘然建築廠屋，却有一位現成工程師在這裏。那位現成工程師，不就是金澹雲的未婚夫林建成嗎？決定了地址以後，她們下一决，就可以去的了林建成一同去觀看。不但是林建成，而且還可以的了金澹雲一同來咧。不過他們的結婚期近了，不要因了這件事，打擾他們吧。（一六三）</p>
<h3>導演了「緩期還債」</h3>
<p>— 夏霞</p>
<p>提起筆來簡直不知道寫什麽好，是爲了沒的可寫嗎？不，相反的正是爲了心裏千頭萬緒可寫的太多了，倒弄得不知從何寫起？</p>
<p>自從上海淪陷爲孤島以後，很多戲劇界的先進，能者都。先後的離開了，所以在這「蜀中無大將，廖化充先鋒」的時期，低能像我這樣的人也居然當起導演來了，這眞和硬打着鴨子上架一樣的勉强滑糟，自己一想到就忍不住心跳害怕，流汗慙愧。　但是能說爲了自己的低能不配，就放棄了道個能爲受難的同胞們盡一點心，効一點力的機會嗎？不，不，一千個不，一萬個不，就算我是一百廿分的低能，沒出息，不中用，就算我所能盡的心，効的力是像一粒芝蔴那麼渺小，但是總比沒有的好，因爲芝蔴雖小，集多了也照樣有用，所以我決定了在這决慈善公演中盡我這一粒芝蔴似的心力。我寗肯厚着臉皮不自揣量的答應了導演「綏期還債」這個戲，我情願丟人，現眼，出醜，受累，我準備着去聽人家駡我不够資格，太不自量，我等着接受一切關於戲的壞批評，但是我不肯放棄了這佩能爲難胞盡一點心力的機會。</p>
<p>現在已經不再是國家興亡，只匹夫有責的時代了，國家並不是僅屬於男人的，是屬於每一個國民的，愛國不分男女不分老幼，男人所能做的事，我們女人也要做，因爲我們同樣的人，同樣的是國民，對國家我們同樣的負有責任</p>
<p>一陣子感情衝動，自己也壓止不住，再寫下去不知道還要說些什麼了。爲了保持我一貫的主張「少說話多做事，」還是暫時停住吧。好在呌我能够痛快淋漓把一腔子的話都說出來的日子並不是沒有，那麼還是留在那時再說吧。</p>
<p>現在我只希望愛護我的朋友們對我這决導演的「緩期還債」能够多多的嚴厲的給一些指敎和批評，因爲我是要靠着你們的指導和督促才會有進步的。</p>
<p>末了，再讓我爲那些受苦受難的同胞們向全上海的中國人要求一聲吧：「親愛的同胞們！來吧！快到黃金來看戲吧！因爲這决的戲不僅是爲了娛樂，在娛樂的後面還有着更大的意義，每個中國的國民都應該義不容辭的到黃金來看戲啊！來吧！大家都快點來吧！」</p>

<h3>海濱熱鬧塲</h3>
<p>南滙邑尊金公蒞任年餘，茲於前月交卸鵲篆，調署吳江。啟程前數日，各紳士咸具餞筵，連日飛觴醉羽，幾同鄭驛留賓，送匾者送牌者絡繹於途。及起程時，車馬盈衢，人聲鼎沸，當公賦別登輿，一路旌旗林立，五色飛揚，計德政牌數對，萬民傘八頂，及萬民衣等件。送行中有白首者，有白鬚者，有黃衣者，有紅鞋者，咸執香跪送，公即出輿俯腰一一抉起，咸給以賞銀。斯時也，觀者如堵，莫不有攀轅之願，臥轍之情。惟其中有殺風景之一事，即有一人手携草囤，滿裝冥鏹，又用帛紙數束，焚於南門之右，噫！此殆魚肉不遂之徒歟。該日花樣雜出。男女擁至，幾至二千餘人，海濱頓成一熱鬧塲矣。</p>
<h3>燕市四妓</h3>
<p>燕市多名妓，今不如昔多矣。然有四妓俱有綽號，其一雪膚花貌，稱爲白麵餑餑；其一似墨畫盡牡丹，稱爲黑麵餅；其一面如滿月，則饅頭五兒也；其一雙鈞如削，則一窩窩也。有某比部者，與四美皆狎，恨窩窩高自位置，於是作竹枝詞嘲之曰：「謾誇餑餑面重羅，會與饅頸領略過；畢竟不如黑麵餅，最無聊賴二窩窩。」窩窩聞之，怒不可遏，請平頭奴招比部至，面數其非，於是互相爭執。比部本有積憾，遂將屋內什物，盡行摔毀，珠殘玉碎，鏡破瓶傾。經人勸散後，窩窩嗚咽終夜，自經於床，幸經鴇母救醒，吾則香消玉殞矣。</p>

<h3>大大王，二大王　荒郊爭雄記（二）</h3>
<p>— 李斐叔</p>
<p>—梅邊雜憶之五—</p>
<p>原來他倆情感旣不融洽，衝突的機會很多。每逢觸發之時，剛要動手，總是被人勸開，不能暢所欲爲，彼此心上，都認爲遺憾！不勝悵悵！</p>
<p>有一天，因爲一件小事，兩人又齟齬起來，所好沒有別人在旁，於是兩人的好，找一個淸靜無人的所在，索性來個痛快，決一個高下，免得彼此常是鬱鬱！兩人旣說定，且互相拍手，以昭大信。是日，兩人皆歡喜逾恒，握手恭敬而別。</p>
<p>壯男的圖爭，就從第二天開始了。在這天戲畢之後，一同走出後臺，兩人一邊走，一邊互相商議：「今天我們到什麼地方去呢？」「南下窪子黑龍潭好不好？」「好！」於是兩人便走向黑龍潭去。</p>
<p>黑龍潭：是南城外最曠野的地方，孤墳纍纍，荒草綿綿！附近旣無人烟，又是人跡所罕到的所在。除掉那遠遠隱藏在「衰楊敗柳叢中的一角雉堞，同那冷淸淸有如「深山蕭寺」般的「陶然亭」之外，此外所能觸進眼簾的，只有那「天上浮幻着的白雲」，與「京西的翠微山色」而巳！眞乃是「平沙無垠，夐不見人，」好一片戰塲也！</p>
<p>他們走到了目的地，各人脫去了上衣，露出了男子的筋肉之美！開始武力爭鬭。他倆的打法很特別，並非如打BOxing一樣，兩人扭做一團。他們是先由一人，脫去上衣，站立不動，除掉足以制命的部分不許動手外，其餘任便由對方怎樣的打，絕對不許回手。等到被打者認爲挨打得心滿意足，而打人者也打得筋疲力盡之後，這才休息五分鐘，席地而坐，依然談笑如恒。休息旣畢，再如法泡製，換一人換打。兩人事先的好，倘是誰先嘴中喊出了一聲「哎呀哇！」那末他便「示弱」了！默認是「打敗」了！算不得是「英雄好漢」。</p>

<h3>陳燕燕小姐含淚悲談：電影是我的生命（中）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>終天抱恨的從影史</p>
<p>…投身銀幕一番巧遇</p>
<p>有家親戚是北平城裏「中天電影院」的主人。自己對於電影，從小便似沒命般的愛好。因爲戚家開這戲院關係，也就儘多看電影的機會。這時候不論任何中西影片，簡直是無片不看。像楊耐梅女士，張織雲女士等許多作品，更使我看得如醉如迷，至有接連看上五六决的；——允其是張織雲女士，我最對她欽慕，可說是她最忠實的信徒。不過，自己心坎裏那時還沒一些兒投身銀幕的想念。後來，一九三一年的春初，我是十八歲了：忽然遇到一個極巧的機會：羅明佑先生在上海初創聯華影業公司，他爲第一片拍演「故都春夢」的事，親自統率孫瑜先生和巳故的阮玲玉女士等一行工作人員到平攝取故都實景；同時又正好全住在我父親和姑丈合開的旅舍「東安飯店」。由此獲得特殊接近的機緣，白天裹跟他們奔東奔西去看拍戲；早晚間更和他們在旅室裏往來間談；就那樣談來談去，經他們說我「你也很能拍戲，是位銀幕上的可造之材。」一言打動，就此喜出望外，頓時燃起了我烈熖的熱情，和他們開始進一步的談判。</p>
<p>…嚴父失歡齋恨而逝</p>
<p>聯華當局對我誠意錄用，一說即合，五年合同的條件也都談妥了。無如家父絕端反對，萬難許可。他老人家的舊思想以爲電影不是怎樣正當職業，女孩兒家混在裹面，更極易學壞。本來，我也明知道父親的意向，以前爲了讀書，還不願意使我跑上學校裏去，要離家遠行去拍電影，當然是件勢所不能的事。可是，我對於電影實在太喜歡了，無論如何，決非爭此一著，去幹這工作不可。因此在家裏啼啼哭哭，反抗得非常厲害。我對父親說：良莠不齊那是恒情，絕非獨是電影界爲然；做人只須自己打定主張，即使環境不良，也未必會便與同化。要是去了以後，我立意做了好人才回來，不做好人就不回來了。</p>
<p>父親聽了這話不勝傷心。母親則是不加可吾，但說：女兒到那裏，我就跟她到那裹。隨後經人多方說勸，父親只在搖頭嘆氣，關於合同限期五年也嫌得太遠，更不贊同。而我的意見，又以爲即使訂下十年，亦仍非去不可。聯華這合同，照例須經家長簽字，方爲有效；在父親執意甚堅下，因又成爲了事實上的最大阻碍。直到聯華外景隊事畢離平，我即不顧一切跟他們上了火車；父親當下趕到站上，看着我不住流淚；有位父執和他一起在塲，見此僵局，勢難挽回，這才出以强迫方式，在月台上拉住父親右手，就車窗間硬使執筆劃押合同，方吿完事。可是，我雖滿心歡喜，母女兩人到了上海，就此投身電影界來；而父親却是冷淸淸的獨居寡歡，叉兼心上總屬很不謂然，只經半年工夫，他就爲我鬱鬱致疾，竟於齊恨長逝了。（語此淚下，簌簌不已。）</p>

<h3>Halifax Assures Ambassador Quo: British Government Still Willing to Continue Aiding China; Claims Tokyo Agreement Does Not Violate Nine-Power Treaty; Hull Reiterates U.S. Far East Policy Unchanged</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon to inquire about information regarding British-Japanese negotiations and investigate the truth of the situation. Ambassador Quo lodged a protest, opposing any possible concessions by Britain in North China that would harm Chinese interests. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) According to sources revealed today, Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi had a lengthy meeting with Foreign Secretary Halifax last night. Halifax reiterated the assurances made in Parliament, stating that the British-Japanese negotiations do not include any changes in British policy toward China or a rejection of possible aid to China. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon and immediately expressed dissatisfaction that the preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan violated the Nine-Power Treaty. He strongly urged the Foreign Secretary to demonstrate the agreement's true intentions by continuing to provide loans and credit to China. It is noted that the Chinese government has long expressed dissatisfaction with the delayed payment of millions of pounds in British credit to China. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the British government provided the Chinese authorities with a firm assurance, stating that the Arita-Craigie agreement did not tacitly approve of Japanese troops being stationed in China, nor did it indicate that Britain had changed its Far East policy. This assurance was given by Foreign Secretary Halifax to Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi. Quo had previously requested clarification from the British side regarding the Tokyo Agreement, pointing out that the agreement clearly violated the Nine-Power Treaty and other League of Nations resolutions. Halifax replied that the British side had acknowledged in the Tokyo Agreement that Japanese troops were already stationed in China, but avoided stating that the British side endorsed the Japanese acts of aggression. All provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and League of Nations resolutions remained unchanged by the new agreement. In the new agreement, Britain did not recognize Japan's belligerent rights. Halifax admitted last night that the issue of Chinese currency would be mentioned in the forthcoming talks, but Britain insisted that the Chinese legal tender issue could not be resolved without the consent of the United States and other relevant countries. According to a British government spokesperson, the Japanese side had originally intended to request that Britain cease providing loans to China, but after Craigie's strong contention, the Japanese side no longer insisted. Therefore, it is generally believed that Britain's new loan of three million pounds to China will soon be finalized. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Observers here today generally anticipate that Britain will not change its current policy in the Far East. According to State Department officials, even if Japan hopes to sign an agreement identical to the one negotiated between Britain and Japan, the United States has no intention of doing so. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) When Secretary of State Hull hosted reporters today, he was asked for his opinion on Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement. He replied that he had already explained the U.S. stance on June 19th and asked the reporters to refer to it. He added that since then, the situation in the Far East had not changed, and the United States had no reason to change its policy. (Note: Secretary of State Hull had stated that the incidents that led to the Tianjin Incident were not the concern of the U.S. government, but "their development and significance, as judged by what has been heard and seen in other parts of China, are extremely broad in scope, and the United States is indeed concerned.") In addition, he had received reports on various recent incidents in China involving Americans. He was watching these disputes with great interest and concern, such as the incident in which Becker, a clerk on the U.S. warship "Guam," was beaten by a Japanese sentry in Hankou. Rear Admiral Yarnell, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, had submitted a report to the Navy Department, stating that the Japanese soldiers were entirely responsible for the incident. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Government Authorities Maintain Cautious Stance; Anti-British Sentiment Grows Among Chongqing Residents</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese authorities are currently maintaining a cautious attitude toward the rumored agreement reached at the British-Japanese conference in Tokyo. The younger, more extreme factions are displaying impatience. This faction criticized, saying that if Japan can engage in anti-British movements, why can't China? They also stated that if Britain refuses to aid China and compromises with Japan, hoping to sacrifice China to protect its interests, then we must warn Britain that if China is destroyed, there will be little left for Britain to protect. This faction accuses Britain of betraying China, saying that when British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr recently visited Chongqing, the Chinese government, to show China's sincerity in cooperating with Britain and France, ordered a cessation of all anti-Japanese activities in the concessions. But look at the current situation in the foreign concessions; anti-Chinese activities have increased. If the situation becomes dire, the Chinese can all withdraw from the concessions and simultaneously begin to take countermeasures, surprising the owners of the concessions and forcing them to reconsider their attitude. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese individuals, although previously eager to know the content of the original British-Japanese compromise, are now carefully studying it. Generally speaking, however, they do not overemphasize it, believing that regardless of the wording of the compromise, the fact remains that Britain has compromised with Japan. President Chiang had already discussed China's attitude yesterday morning before the British-Japanese communique was released, indicating that Britain had made concessions. Anti-British sentiment among the Chinese is visibly growing everywhere in Chongqing. The following criticism can summarize the rest: It says that if Chamberlain's explanation is merely about savage force and violence, then we will follow suit in the future. The more prudent elements advocate that from now on, China must completely disregard the possibility of foreign aid and fight the war on its own. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese side here believes that the preliminary Tokyo agreement between Britain and Japan is better than they had anticipated. However, most Chinese are unwilling to discuss future issues, as it remains uncertain whether this agreement can be implemented as Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons. The most satisfying point for the Chinese in the preliminary agreement is that the British side did not offer a promise of strict neutrality, nor did it recognize the existence of a state of war, and did not suspend currency aid and loans to China, allowing for the possibility of not closing the滇緬 (Dianmian) Burma Road. As for whether the so-called "Japanese-controlled areas" include the concessions of various countries in China, this is a question. If it includes the concessions of various countries in China, then all Chinese patriotic activities in the concessions will come to an end, pro-China newspapers may all be forced to close, and Chinese bankers and merchants will also suffer considerable disadvantages. However, concessions may not be interpreted as Japanese military control areas. Some Chinese officials believe that if a European war breaks out, the British can use this agreement with Japan to satisfy Japanese demands, thereby securing its interests in China. If a European war does not occur, then Britain can refuse Japan's various demands by citing the lack of such provisions in the preliminary agreement and threaten Japan with financial aid to China to force it to comply. However, all sectors of the Chinese community recognize that the preliminary agreement has not resolved any disputes between Britain and Japan, so there will inevitably be many conflicts in interpretation and implementation in the future. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Meeting Discusses New Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning's Cabinet meeting discussed the Nomonhan Incident, the situation in China, and the decline of the 法幣 (fabi) Chinese currency. Army Minister Itagaki reported on the new conflicts on the Manchurian border. Finance Minister Ishiwata, after stating the reasons for the decline in the value of the fabi Chinese currency, said that the biggest reason for the decline of fabi was the lack of support from the exchange equalization fund. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Ishiwata today predicted that if the current situation continues unchanged, the value of the Chinese fabi will continue to fall, and advocated determining an independent monetary policy to deal with the inevitable decline in the fabi's value. Cabinet members then freely exchanged opinions on the war in China. It is heard that Army Minister Itagaki was unwilling to express his opinion, while Interior Minister Kido advocated determining a new plan based on the "new situation" in China and the implementation of Japan's firm intentions to resolve the China Incident. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3>British-Japanese Compromise Plan Unanimously Supported by British Newspapers; Continued Support for Chinese Currency; Japanese Aggressive Propaganda Should Not Be Lightly Believed</h3>
<p>(London) The Times' diplomatic correspondent commented on the British-Japanese plan today, saying that many foreign observers in London last night believed that the second thought on the British-Japanese compromise was not bad. Britain has not abandoned anything in its plan, but rather reorganized the existing situation and provided a basis for future living conditions. This plan certainly does not suggest that Britain has already bound itself in advance and must comply with any demands that the Japanese commander in China may raise. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Several newspapers today endorsed the Japanese interpretation of the British-Japanese compromise, and many newspapers strongly advocated that Britain should continue to aid the Chinese fabi currency. The "News Chronicle" stated that there is now fear that the Soviet Union and the United States may recognize the Japanese view of the British-Japanese talks as more feasible, because actions speak louder than empty words. Therefore, the British government should seek to lend a large sum of money to China to demonstrate that its words are not false. This is a special way for the British government to express its recognition of China's major war in the East. Recognizing past facts is more important than safeguarding British rights in "this concession or that" concession. Action should now be used as evidence. The "Manchester Guardian" said that, from a generous point of view, the British government is now deliberately accepting a vague plan in the hope that the Tianjin dispute will be resolved soon. If Japan intends to recognize that this compromise will be applied to all of China, equal to the British guaranteeing cooperation with the Japanese conquest, if such an interpretation is entirely wrong, then the best way to quickly remove the damage caused in China, the United States, and Britain. What we should declare is that our aid to the Chinese fabi today is no less important than before. We cannot restrict the export of any materials that we can supply to China to help it continue its resistance. Our aim is to maintain the neutrality of the concessions, which may be justified, but in the broader struggle between China and Japan, cold-blooded neutrality is neither possible nor desirable for us. The "Daily Mail" said that Craigie did well in a very difficult job, and he has safely passed the first difficult hurdle in the British-Japanese negotiations. Now Japanese newspapers have reported eleven demands that hinder Britain's position in China, but Chamberlain has clearly stated in the House of Commons that the talks will be strictly limited to local issues. Britain should not take any action that would hinder the Chinese currency system. There are two kinds of arguments from the Japanese side, the more extreme ones we should ignore, and the milder ones seem to be more authoritative. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The "Daily Telegraph" stated today that Tokyo has boasted of a great victory for the new order in East Asia, and German newspapers have spread rumors of British capitulation. These are all unfortunate and unavoidable examples of a new diplomatic tactic of covering up calm negotiations with shouting. Although people are inevitably worried that the rumors of British capitulation may be true, there is no reason to worry in the official documents or Chamberlain's brief remarks. Japanese military politicians seem to have hoped that Arita would include proposals to abolish the circulation of fabi, recall the ambassador to China, stop supplies passing through Burma, and recognize the puppet government in the Tianjin incident negotiations. However, judging from Chamberlain's statement that future discussions will be limited to local issues in Tianjin, it seems that the above proposals, even if they were made, have been withdrawn and may not be revived. There are currently no new features in the military situation in the Far East, and the Japanese army's recent attitude towards the British certainly does not require a complete change in British policy. Resolving the Tianjin dispute is not only what the British government wants, but also what the Japanese government needs. For the sake of continuing talks, there is an agreement to make Britain clearly recognize the Japanese invasion, but this recognition inherently contains the realization of China's resistance as an important component. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3>Eastern Newspaper Praises Diplomatic Success</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today all congratulated Foreign Minister Arita on his diplomatic success and praised Britain for showing statesmanship in Tokyo. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Navy Minister Yonai, referring to the talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, warned the nation not to think that as a result of the talks, Britain has completely changed its Far East policy. It is said that now we must pay attention to Britain's attitude towards various issues, including monetary issues. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Currency Stability Issue British Labour Party MP Draws Government's Attention</h3>
<p>(London) At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, opposition Labour MP Bellenger drew the government's attention to the further decline in the exchange rate of Chinese currency and asked whether the Chinese exchange equalization fund had indeed been exhausted. Finance Minister Simon immediately replied, "The status of the Chinese currency and the accounts of the equalization fund must be kept secret, which is no different from the need to keep the same accounts secret in our country or any other country. The distinguished member will certainly understand this. I issued a statement on July 11, and nothing more or less." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News recently stated that the China Association convened yesterday to consider whether to ask the British government to replenish the Chinese currency equalization fund, believing that the original fund is now running out. The meeting did not reach a decision on policy and adjourned to study Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks on the Tokyo talks. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Aid to China Association Speaks Out Righteously</h3>
<p>(London) The Aid to China Committee issued an article today stating that the British-Japanese plan announced by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons is simply an undeniable betrayal of China, which is bravely resisting to defend its national independence and territorial integrity. The terms and obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations' notice to member states to provide material assistance to China, not to take actions that could weaken China's resistance, and not to recognize situations created by force must be followed. Only by fulfilling these obligations can Britain maintain its dignity and avoid being an accomplice in acts of aggression. (Reuter, 25th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attacked Chongqing the Night Before Last; French Embassy Almost Affected; Bombs Mostly Fell in Suburbs with Little Damage; Various Locations in Jiangxi Province Bombed Separately</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Twenty-seven Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing last night, encountering intense anti-aircraft fire and engaging in fierce battles with Chinese fighter planes. The main areas attacked were in the western suburbs of the city and the area north of the Jialing River. Several bombs fell near the French Embassy, the closest being only a hundred yards away. A large fire broke out near the Jialing River, with intense flames illuminating the riverbank. Several bombs fell into the river. The Reuters temporary office in the western suburbs was almost destroyed, as three bombs landed within twenty yards of it, fortunately without exploding. One fell on the tennis court, and the other two fell in a narrow alley leading to the house of a foreign news agency correspondent. The walls of the house shook and collapsed, but the correspondent was unharmed. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Last night, twenty-seven Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing. Most of the bombs fell in the suburbs, causing little damage. There was only one fire, located on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Items from the German Consulate in Chongqing have been moved to the new German Embassy to avoid air raids. Several bombs fell near the German News Agency. A German-owned house was slightly damaged when a bomb exploded twenty-five yards away. When the Japanese aircraft came to bomb, several Chinese aircraft took off to engage. The fighters took off quickly and drove away the Japanese bombers before the Chinese anti-aircraft guns could unleash their power. (Haitong News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(Ji'an) Thirty-five Japanese aircraft, in batches, attacked Jiangxi on the 24th. The first batch of two aircraft flew to Xingan and Xiajiang at around 8 a.m., wreaking havoc and dropping three bombs in each county. The second batch of six aircraft invaded Fengcheng at around 6 a.m., dropping eleven bombs inside and outside the city. The third batch of six aircraft invaded Xiushui at around 9 a.m., circling and observing for a long time before leaving. The fourth batch of thirteen aircraft passed through Wuning and Xiushui, harassing Hunan. The fifth batch of two aircraft invaded Zhangshu at 4:40 p.m., dropping six bombs inside and outside the city. The sixth batch of six aircraft attacked Zhangshu again at 5 p.m., dropping more than twenty bombs blindly before fleeing north. The city had alarms twice. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) At around 1 p.m. today, three Japanese aircraft flew over Changmen and dropped eight bombs, then invaded the airspace of Fuzhou City, strafing along the river with machine guns before escaping half an hour later. Three Japanese aircraft were also spotted in Gaoshan, Fuqing, at around 3 p.m. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) When twenty-seven Japanese aircraft bombed here last night, the staff of the French Embassy and the foreign press corps nearly suffered an undeserved disaster. The Japanese aircraft dropped about sixty bombs, one of which hit fifty yards from the French Embassy, and two others landed in the new hotel where the cadres of the Associated Press, Havas, and Reuters were stationed. The residence of German national Genmuro has been destroyed. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) An alarm was issued here at 6:30 p.m. last night, at which time Japanese aircraft had already flown over the border of Sichuan Province, heading towards Hechuan, as if intending to go elsewhere besides Chongqing. But halfway, they suddenly turned to the northwest of Chongqing and flew straight to Chongqing, arriving over the city at 7:30 p.m., dropping bombs on the north bank of the Jialing River, and then turning southeast to bomb the western suburbs of Chongqing. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3>British-Japanese Four-Person Committee Begins Discussing Tianjin Case; Proceeding in an Atmosphere of Compromise; Japanese Foreign Minister Hosts Banquet for Representatives</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that the committee composed of British representatives Beckett and Herbert and Japanese representatives Tanaka and Ota is discussing the issue of security and maintaining peace and order in the British concession in Tianjin today. There were no records of the discussions, but in a moderate atmosphere and in accordance with the compromise on the general issues of the background of the Tianjin situation reached between Craigie and Arita, opinions were freely exchanged. It is heard that they discussed: (1) suppressing and jointly investigating those who generally violate the law; (2) suppressing and generally searching anti-Japanese and communist elements; (3) establishing a British-Japanese liaison office to maintain peace and order. It is expected that the committee will submit a report to the plenary session of British and Japanese representatives this afternoon or tomorrow morning. According to well-informed Japanese sources, if Britain and Japan reach an agreement on this issue, other issues in the Tianjin situation, including economic difficulties, can be easily resolved. After this morning's meeting, all British and Japanese representatives attended a luncheon at the residence of the Japanese Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>At 6:05 p.m. today, the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following communiqué on the meeting of the British-Japanese roundtable committee today: "The four-person committee assigned to review certain details of the Tianjin situation met at the Foreign Minister's residence this morning and adjourned at 5:45 p.m. All representatives will meet at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Preliminary Anglo-Japanese Agreement</h3>
<p>Our newspaper already discussed in general terms the rumored concessions made by Great Britain to Japan the day before yesterday. Yesterday, London and Tokyo simultaneously announced the preliminary agreement concluded by the United Kingdom and Japan at the Tokyo Conference. Let us now examine it:</p>
<p>The content of the agreement was published in yesterday's newspaper. For the convenience of the reporter's writing, it is reproduced again below:</p>
<p>"The British Government fully recognizes the actual situation in China where large-scale hostilities are currently underway, and recognizes that, given the continued existence of this state of affairs, the Japanese forces in China have special needs to ensure their own security and maintain public order in the areas under their control. The British Government will prevent or eliminate any actions or events that may hinder the Japanese forces or benefit the enemy. The British Government has no intention of assisting any actions that may hinder the Japanese forces from achieving the aforementioned objectives, and will take this opportunity to clearly inform British officials and expatriates in China that they should not engage in such behaviors or plans, in order to confirm the British policy in this matter."</p>
<p>There are unexpected points in reviewing this agreement, namely: (1) The word "neutrality" is absent from the agreement. For weeks, in Anglo-Japanese discussions, be it official or unofficial, or even from any other party involved, the issue of concessions and negotiations in Tokyo has invariably centered on the concept of neutrality. Our newspaper has also commented, "It is unreasonable and unauthorized for Britain to maintain neutrality in the Far East." The agreement does not mention neutrality. London newspapers, after the agreement was published, also used the argument that the agreement did not recognize Japan's belligerent rights as a way to justify the situation, which is also based on the agreement's silence on neutrality. We will not elaborate on this point today. What is essential to know is that this is a diplomatic maneuver, a sleight of hand, a tactic of substituting the pearl for the casket. Both the UK and Japan see avoiding the issue in this way as beneficial to their own interests. (2) The agreement does not mention British rights. The general principle of international agreements is reciprocity. Even in a dictated peace, the victorious nation grants the defeated nation some degree of leeway. However, this agreement is only a one-sided acknowledgment from Britain to Japan, a recognition upon recognition. The whole world must want to call this a standard written endorsement. The Tokyo talks were indeed suggested by Britain, and the British even expressed their good fortune that Japan accepted the suggestion. However, the preliminary achievement of the proposer is only "recognition upon recognition," while its own rights are not even mentioned by the other party. This is truly a miracle of British diplomacy!</p>
<p>Next, please analyze the contents of the agreement: The scope of what Britain "fully" recognizes is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding facts: Large-scale hostilities are taking place in China;</p>
<p>(2) Regarding time: The period during which large-scale hostilities continue to exist;</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the opponent: Japanese forces;</p>
<p>(4) Regarding purpose: The Japanese forces need to ensure their own security, need to maintain public order in the areas under their control, need to prevent or eliminate any actions or events that may hinder the Japanese forces, and need to prevent or eliminate any actions or events that may benefit the Chinese forces;</p>
<p>(5) Regarding passive obligations: The British government will not assist any actions that hinder the Japanese forces from achieving the aforementioned objectives;</p>
<p>(6) Regarding active obligations: The British government shall order British officials and expatriates in China to uphold this intention and act accordingly.</p>
<p>The reporter is confident in the faithfulness and accuracy of this analysis. We sincerely hope that British people and people around the world will compare this analysis with the full text of the agreement, and then cross-reference it with the statement made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the British House of Commons on the 24th, the day the agreement was announced, that "this negotiation is limited to the Tianjin local dispute." Is our analysis faithful? Is it accurate? The reporter humbly requests that Chamberlain remove his umbrella and show his true face to heaven.</p>
<p>Since this agreement is of a preliminary nature, it does not involve any specific issues. However, because there are no concrete problems, some members of the British Conservative Party still defend Chamberlain and deny that it is a failure! However, the scope is clear, the purpose is distinct, and Britain has "fully" acknowledged it in a written endorsement. Therefore, Japan and Germany and Italy are delighted with Britain's submission and Japan's success. However, the judgment of success or failure does not depend on concrete issues. Compared with the Nine-Power Treaty's provisions for the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and administration, based on the Japanese objectives that Britain fully recognizes, and the unilateral passive and active obligations that Britain bears, how can one recognize the conduct of large-scale hostilities? How can one recognize the actions of Japanese forces with this purpose? Compared with Britain's repeated resolutions to demand that Japan open the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, how can one recognize the military needs that Japan claims as its justification? And Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the military attache of the British Embassy in China, can greatly hinder the needs of the Japanese army and violate British obligations and deserve to die; this so-called need and obligation is what Britain fully recognizes. If he does not die, it depends on the Japanese army's permission to forgive the past and deal with him leniently. All of the above points, using today's agreement, to measure the unresolved issues between Britain and Japan in recent years, Japan succeeds and Britain fails, which is already clearly evident in this preliminary agreement, how can it still be denied!</p>
<p>As for developing this preliminary agreement into a second or third step, it depends on future step-by-step negotiations between the UK and Japan. It is not yet time for that, nor the matter, so there is no need to be rashly dogmatic. Certain types of problems and events will be based on the preliminary agreement and what form they will take in the future and what the outcome will be. However, based on the preliminary agreement, to make a general inference, if Britain makes any requests or protests to Japan, Japan can use military needs as an impenetrable shield. If Japan makes any demands or protests to Britain, Japan can use military needs as an impenetrable spear. Spears and shields are sharp weapons, and powerful countries can have them. However, Britain's sharp weapons, at least in diplomacy, have been disarmed against Japan by the preliminary agreement, and are now possessed exclusively by Japan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, step-by-step negotiations are a matter for both parties, and the power to accept or reject each point rests with oneself. Japan can make extravagant demands, but how difficult is it for Britain to refuse them sternly? If the preliminary agreement is like that, doesn't Britain have room to maneuver? Could it be that Britain has used up all of its iron to forge this great mistake? Yes, it is indeed possible; what constitutes a military necessity, what constitutes an obstructive action, all depends on how it is interpreted; Japan interprets it one way, Britain can interpret it another way, there is no definitive conclusion. Those with a sense of justice, who does not pity Britain and hope for it to recover, who would sympathize with Japan and advocate for it? If Britain can grasp the interpretation and reject what must be rejected, it would be welcomed by the world. However, is this to be expected? Judging from Britain's recent actions, it is not only a great defeat and mistake in diplomatic policy, but also a fundamental defeat and mistake in psychology and reason. In a small sense: when the Tianjin concession was blockaded, the British authorities comforted the parliamentarians by saying that British expatriates were fortunate that the milk supply had not been cut off, and so on, three or five times. While the Tokyo negotiations were underway, the British authorities begged Japan, saying, can the anti-Japanese movement not be suspended for a while? What is the meaning of this attitude! From a broader perspective: Britain always and everywhere regards facts as incorrigible, so it dares not clearly distinguish between right and wrong, and has absolutely no faith in justice. It always and everywhere calculates its own interests, and regards immediate and small gains as benefits, and immediate and small harms as harms, so it disregards the long-term and great future. It always and everywhere prides itself on its cleverness, but it is deceived by the most immature and most brutal. In the past, it was concerned about the Far East, but it prioritized appeasing the situation in Europe, so it compromised and sought complete accommodation, but the situation in Europe worsened daily. It appeased Germany with the Munich Agreement, but Germany was insatiable. It tried to alienate Germany and Italy, but Germany and Italy formed an alliance. Now, it makes concessions to Japan through the Tokyo talks, thinking that it can temporarily stabilize Japan and suppress Germany and Italy's囂張in Europe. This is a wonderful trick in diplomacy to defeat the aggressor groups one by one. It does not know that Japan and Germany and Italy, supporting and relying on each other, will continue their policies of aggression to the end and never separate. It does not know that concessions are not a way to limit aggression but actually help to promote aggression. It does not know that the movement or stillness, the civil or military, the alternating rise and fall, or the simultaneous actions of Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome are all aimed at defeating the anti-aggression front one by one! Germany and Italy not only rejoice for Japan, but also congratulate it, and they also rejoice and congratulate themselves. The public opinion in Britain and France points and laughs at Germany, Japan and Italy are worried, doubtful and cry for this. Is this not a great defeat and mistake in psychology and reason!</p>
<p>The above is a general review of the Anglo-Japanese preliminary agreement. As for the impact on the overall situation in the Far East and China's resistance against Japan, it will definitely not be very strong. The Anglo-Japanese negotiations and agreement are not enough to control China and the Far East. On the contrary, the future of the agreement, and the fate of China, and even the fate of Britain in the Far East, will be determined by China's resistance against Japan!</p>

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Reviews Sino-Japanese War Situation</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A major newspaper in this city wrote an article reviewing the Sino-Japanese war, saying, "In the first half of July, the Chinese side took the initiative on the central China front. The fierce battles in various provinces of North China prove that the Japanese claim that the guerrillas have collapsed is completely unfounded. According to the Japanese themselves, in the past six months, in the Shanghai area alone, the Japanese army and the guerrillas have fought 39 times, and the Japanese army has been defeated each time. The Japanese army is now launching a large-scale offensive in the southeastern part of Shanxi and the adjacent areas of Hebei and Henan provinces, attempting to encircle the regular Chinese army and guerrillas there. The Japanese army participating in the offensive has 120,000 men, with powerful technical equipment. This action has so far been unsuccessful. In many cities and towns, the two sides have repeatedly entered and exited in recent times, with no definite outcome. And in the first half of July, in fifteen days, the Japanese army has suffered 17,000 casualties. The recent war situation further proves the high combat effectiveness of the Chinese army, which is sufficient to resist the Japanese army resolutely." (TASS dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Sakhalin Island Dispute: Soviet Union Firmly Rejects Japanese Protest; Accuses Japanese Government of Protecting Illegal Activities; Loan for the China Eastern Railway Not Yet Repaid</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vydanyevsky, invited Japanese Ambassador Togo to meet today. He personally handed the Japanese Ambassador a reply from the Foreign Affairs Committee to the memorandum submitted by Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Nishi, on April 27 of this year.</p>
<p>The Japanese memorandum raised various issues regarding the conduct of Japanese businesses holding oil and coal mining concession rights in Northern Sakhalin. These businesses have consistently violated contractual obligations, even failing to pay rent and violating Soviet laws. The Japanese government has defended their actions and protested against the so-called errors made by Soviet agencies.</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Committee's reply resolutely rejects this protest, pointing out that the Japanese government's intention is purely to defend the illegal activities of the concession rights holders at any cost, even though these businesses have violated the contract and Soviet laws. The reply lists all the facts of violations of the contract and laws. It is stated that these businesses have systematically violated labor safety and fire prevention regulations, failing to comply with the repeated advice of Soviet labor inspectors and state fire agencies to take appropriate steps to reduce fire hazards and address deficiencies in labor safety equipment. The inspection of 244 facilities between 1938 and 1939 revealed 457 violations of labor safety and fire prevention laws. Due to poor fire prevention, multiple fires have occurred in the concession areas. For example, on November 2, 1935, two derricks in the Okha oil field were destroyed by fire due to electrical equipment defects. On November 21, 1937, a drilling rig was burned down. On July 19, 1938, an oil depot was completely burned down. The Soviet government cannot tolerate such violations of fire prevention laws, as the oil fields operated by the concession businesses are interspersed with Soviet state-owned oil fields. A fire in the concession area would endanger the lives of nearby Soviet oil fields and even local civilians. The concession agreement clearly stipulates the procedures for drilling, surveying, and mining in each field. However, the concession businesses have consistently evaded fully executing the necessary survey work, thereby violating Soviet mining laws. These technical regulations must be followed by anyone, and the Japanese concession businesses are no exception. These businesses have also violated the provisions of the contract and Soviet laws regarding the protection of labor safety. As a result, many accidents have occurred in the concession area. In 1937 alone, there were 96 accidents. The same is true in the coal mining concession area. Although its scope of work is very small, seven accidents have occurred in three months of 1939. The Japanese claim that Soviet agencies have obstructed the operation of the coal mining concession businesses has no basis whatsoever. The violator of the contract is not the Soviet agency but the Japanese business itself. They had almost completely ceased operations by 1937, thereby causing the Soviet government to lose a portion of the income that these businesses should have paid. On this point alone, the Soviet government has the right to cancel the concession rights before the expiration date based on the contract. The Nishi memorandum claimed that Soviet officials have exerted pressure on Japanese concession businesses. One example cited was that the Soviets ordered Japanese coal businesses to destroy the explosives stockpiled at the concession coal mine on February 15 of this year. In reality, the violator in this matter was also the Japanese business, because they did not comply with Soviet regulations for storing explosives. Since December 14, 1935, Japanese coal and oil concession businesses have not paid the rent due to the Soviet government, totaling 892,457.58 rubles to date. Since 1937, the oil concession businesses have also failed to fulfill their obligations for housing construction. Furthermore, according to the investigation by a special committee, the concession businesses, while requesting the import of goods and food from Japan, secretly stored enough goods and food to last six to seven months in existing warehouses for a certain special purpose. In the warehouses of these businesses, Berdan rifles, gunpowder, field telescopes, and other items prohibited from import into the Soviet Union were confiscated. There were also five sets of equipment for distilling alcohol and several barrels of raw materials. At the same time, the committee also found that the concession businesses had imported rice from Japan to supply illegal distilleries and sold goods to people unrelated to the concession area, and privately smuggled inferior goods and food to sell to workers. Despite accumulating a large quantity of goods and food, the concession businesses reduced the rations of essential foods such as meat, milk, onions, rice, and sugar to workers by 20% to 25% twice, in December 1938 and January 1939. The concession contract stipulates that the concession businesses may employ Japanese middle and lower-level workers, but not more than 25% of the total. However, in practice, these businesses have repeatedly used various tricks to violate this provision. As a result, by August 1938, 43.6% of the workers in the concession area were Japanese. Although Soviet agencies, in accordance with the contract, provided sufficient workers for these businesses to employ, they intentionally evaded and instead hired workers from Japan. For example, in 1937, at the request of the oil concession businesses, the Soviets recruited 1,700 Soviet workers and sent them to Vladivostok. However, the Japanese businesses delayed hiring them for 64 days. The same event occurred in 1938. When using Japanese naval tankers to transport oil through Japan, they also violated Soviet regulations canceling foreign warship berthing and crew landing. The Soviet government has repeatedly protested to the Japanese government about the overbearing behavior of the captains of Japanese warships.</p>
<p>All of the above facts prove that Japanese concession businesses have systematically violated the concession contract, recklessly hoping to create conditions for economic activities in Soviet territory similar to those in Manchuria, which is currently forcibly occupied by the Japanese. The absurdity of this attempt has been fully demonstrated by the Foreign Affairs Committee. In short, the Soviet government will resolutely stop all actions that violate the contract and Soviet laws. Japan has recently spread rumors claiming that the Soviet Union intends to cancel Japan's concession rights in Northern Sakhalin. This is a completely malicious rumor. The Soviet government, as in the past, will continue to faithfully abide by the concession contract and other treaties, without any difference. If the Japanese businesses also faithfully fulfill the conditions of the contract, their businesses can develop. In conclusion, the People's Commissariat rejects all declarations by the Japanese government acting as a defender of the illegal activities of Japanese concession businesses, because they are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>The Japanese government has also shown dishonesty regarding other issues. For example, the Japanese business Matsui Shipyard contracted to build three ships for the Soviet Union in 1936, receiving a deposit of 1,647,650 yen. However, by 1938, not only did they not deliver the completed ships to the Soviet Union, but they also refused to compensate for the losses according to the contract, and even refused to return the deposit. The Japanese government actually defended them.</p>
<p>The Japanese government has also blatantly violated its solemn obligations by refusing to pay the final installment of 5,981,625 yen for the purchase of the China Eastern Railway in March 1938, and has not paid a penny to this day. Although the Japanese government has violated its own obligations and instructed its citizens to do the same, the Soviet government and Soviet economic agencies have consistently abided by their obligations and will not deviate from this principle in the future. The People's Commissariat, while rejecting Japan's unfounded protests, also warns the Japanese government and Japanese concession rights holders, declaring that while the Soviet government abides by its obligations, it will resolutely demand that the Japanese side strictly abide by the laws within Soviet territory.

<h3>Soviet Navy Day: Naval Chief Warns Japan: The Soviet-Mongolian Border is Inviolable; Pacific Fleet Exceeds One Hundred Vessels; More Submarines than Germany and Japan Combined</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Naval Commissar Kuznetsov, in a speech today to 20,000 representatives of public organizations on Soviet Navy Day, warned Japan regarding the Mongolian-Manchurian border conflict, stating that the best guarantee against any danger of armed attacks against the Soviet Union is the ever-growing strength of the Soviet land, sea, and air forces. We know that some frivolous neighbors, such as those in the Far East, now require a lesson in our military might before they realize that our border is inviolable and that we will not allow anyone to infringe upon it. The Soviet Union's naval power is now rapidly increasing, and the shipbuilding industry has reached the stage where it can build all sizes of modern warships for a major naval power. We are currently building destroyers, flagships of destroyer fleets, and cruisers, and are preparing to build dreadnoughts of the Stalin class. The Baltic Fleet has been strengthened annually and will now be augmented with new surface and underwater vessels. The first Soviet warships appeared in the Far East five or six years ago. Today, the number of warships and submarines in the Pacific Fleet exceeds one hundred, not counting smaller vessels such as minesweepers. In view of the frivolity of our neighbors, the Pacific Fleet must maintain special vigilance and is now fully prepared to defend the motherland. The Soviet Union has more submarines than any other country, far exceeding the combined number possessed by Germany and Japan. The Soviet state advocates peace and does not threaten any country, but if enemies force us to use force to defend our homeland, our navy will be the most aggressive, etc. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the entire Soviet Union warmly celebrated Navy Day. All ocean and inland river fleets held review ceremonies and athletic meets. In the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Fleet), battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and other vessels lined up for several kilometers, inspected by Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Tributs and members of the Leningrad Military District and the Baltic Fleet Military Council. After the review, military exercises followed, with participation from land forces, covered by amphibious tanks, warships, and marines. In the Black Sea, celebrations were held in Sevastopol, beginning with a group swim by several thousand sailors and commanders of the fleet. Commander-in-Chief Admiral Oktyabrsky and key officials of the Crimean Autonomous Republic then inspected multiple warships anchored in formation, followed by a public gathering. A large gathering was also held in Khabarovsk in the Far East, with over 50,000 participants. Simultaneously, a review of the Amur River Red Banner Flotilla was held on the Amur River. In the evening, ships anchored along the riverbank in front of Khabarovsk and conducted tactical exercises. (TASS, 25th)</p>
<h3>Fighting Continues in the Nomonhan Area: Report from the Japanese Kwantung Army</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a communiqué released by the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Changchun at 11:35 AM yesterday, the Japanese-Manchukuo forces' counteroffensive against the Soviet-Mongolian allied forces across the Khalkhin Gol River is currently making "smooth progress." On July 11th, the Japanese-Manchukuo forces "repelled" the Soviet-Mongolian forces to a certain point beyond the border, after which they monitored their actions while dealing with the remnants of the Soviet-Mongolian forces in the Nomonhan area. However, the Soviet-Mongolian forces "consistently adopted a provocative attitude," establishing strong artillery positions on the west bank of the Khalkhin Gol River and reinforcing their tank and artillery units, waiting for an opportunity to cross the border again. They repeatedly attempted small-scale attacks on Japanese positions, but were ultimately repelled. On Saturday morning at 7 AM, approximately 2,000 Soviet-Mongolian troops, accompanied by about 100 tanks, crossed the border and launched an attack, whereupon the Japanese-Manchukuo forces initiated a general counteroffensive.

<h3>British Opposition Party Member Questions Negotiations with Germany: Truth of Discussions Gradually Becoming Clear; Germany Also Denies Loan Discussions</h3>
<p>(London) Labour MP Greenwood today asked Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons to comment on the statement by Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson to German economic expert Herr Wohlthat regarding a proposal to provide Germany with a loan. Chamberlain replied that there had been no discussion of a German loan. Greenwood then asked whether the cabinet was aware of such discussions or initiated them, and whether the government intended to begin discussions that resembled bribing Germany to buy peace. Chamberlain replied that none of the cabinet members, except the Overseas Trade Secretary, were aware of this conversation and that the government had no intention of initiating such discussions. One MP asked who was responsible for disclosing the conversation, to which Chamberlain replied that this was also what he wanted to find out. Labour's Will Thorne asked whether government officials could freely engage in conversations without prior government consent, and whether the government could solemnly confirm that no government official had spoken to Wohlthat. Chamberlain replied that he saw nothing particularly harmful in this conversation, as it was a private conversation between Hudson and a German official, and that any harm lay in the newspaper disclosure of the conversation. Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson attended the House of Commons as usual today and answered all questions. According to Reuters, there is no question of Hudson resigning. Foreign Secretary Halifax replied in the House of Lords that Wohlthat came to London as a delegate to the whaling conference and that discussing the refugee problem was also part of Wohlthat's mission, with nothing else involved. Wohlthat has visited London frequently in recent years and often met with British cabinet members concerned with commercial and economic issues between the two countries, as considering such matters is Wohlthat's inherent duty. It is therefore not surprising that the Overseas Trade Secretary met with Wohlthat and discussed matters of interest to both countries. The Foreign Office received a report from the Overseas Trade Department stating that the discussions had reached a stage where they could potentially improve foreign trade, but only if political issues were resolved first. The discussions focused on removing existing obstacles to the development of international trade, such as barter agreements, exchange restrictions, and import quotas. The economic issues then led to financial steps to eliminate these difficulties. The Overseas Trade Secretary stated that, in his personal opinion, if international trust were restored, there would be ample room for cooperation on financial issues. Based on this report, the widespread notion that Britain proposed providing Germany with a loan is untrue. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to reports from London, Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson, in an address to London journalists, mentioned a British plan to lend a large sum of money to Germany, and that this proposal had been put to the German Ministry of Economics representative Herr Walter. A Havas reporter has learned that Germany has no intention of accepting the loan. Although Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson raised this proposal with Walter during his visit to London, it was purely a private exchange of views on economic matters and not a formal negotiation.

<h3>Multiple British Aircraft Fly to France Three Times</h3>
<p>(London) The Air Ministry has announced that today marks the 30th anniversary of the French aviator Blériot's flight across the English Channel. Britain will send multiple squadrons of bombers and fighters, totaling 240 aircraft, to fly over French airspace for the second time for training flights. The French side will also send multiple aircraft for intercept exercises. This is a new development in Anglo-French air force cooperation. Before departure, each British pilot received sealed instructions, to be opened only after take-off, detailing the flight routes for each squadron, including over Paris, Lyon, parts of the Pyrenees Mountains, parts of the Gulf of Lion, and the southern Bay of Biscay, covering a total distance of 1,300 to 1,500 kilometers.

<h3>British-Polish Loan Temporarily Difficult to Establish</h3>
<p>(London) During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon reported on the current state of financial negotiations between Britain and Poland, stating that the British government had proposed to the Polish delegation to guarantee a credit loan of £8 million to the country. However, regarding providing the country with actual funds, Britain and France have not been able to agree on the terms, and the British government may not be able to take the necessary legislative steps for approval before the House of Commons adjourns.

<h3>British Press Tycoon Lord Kemsley Arrives in Berlin to Discuss Exchange of Articles Between Newspapers of Both Countries; Rumored to Take Opportunity to Meet with Hitler</h3>
<p>(Berlin) British press tycoon Lord Kemsley arrived here today and is scheduled to travel to Beirut tomorrow to hold talks with Dietrich, head of the Information Department of the German Foreign Ministry. Local officials commented that Lord Kemsley's visit is at Dietrich's invitation to discuss the exchange of articles between British and German newspapers. Dietrich had made similar overtures to the press in Britain and America, but was not adopted by the American press. The British side expressed sympathy, so Lord Kemsley is making this trip so that Germany's views on current important issues can be published in British newspapers, and vice versa.

<p>(London) Well-informed sources in the Conservative Party stated that General Ironside, Inspector-General of Overseas Forces, is planning to travel to Moscow in the near future to participate in the Anglo-Franco-Soviet military conference.

<h3>Spain's Nation-Building Incomplete, Internal Strife Already Severe</h3>
<p>(Paris) General Tellaño, the "Radio General" of the Spanish Nationalist Army, has been missing since being dismissed from his position as commander of the Second Military Region last week. According to reports from Saint-Jean-de-Luz, the general's attempt to cross the border was unsuccessful and he is currently imprisoned in Vitoria. Several Paris newspapers reported unconfirmed news that General Yagüe, commander of the Madrid garrison, had been arrested for refusing to cooperate with the Axis powers, and that several other generals had also reportedly been dismissed. The French newspaper "L'Ordre" stated that a major upheaval is brewing in Spain, while "Le Temps" stated that General Tellaño's downfall was due to the instigation of Interior Minister Suñer, Franco's brother-in-law, who is known for supporting the Axis powers, and that General Tellaño spoke imprudently during a speech in Seville.

While newspapers here are taking a reserved attitude towards the conflicting reports from various sources, they believe that a serious rift has developed between the restorationists and the fascists in Spain. According to reliable sources cited by "Le Temps," General Tellaño is still residing in Burgos. (Havas, 25th)</p>

The main objective of these exercises is to train submarine crews to attack and destroy a transport fleet. Five submarine flotillas, totaling twenty-five vessels, are participating. The newspapers have devoted considerable space to this news, often claiming the invincibility of the German fleet. The local "Führer newspaper" stated that "these exercises demonstrate the power of our submarines, just as they did during the Great War. This is an effective and powerful factor in defending the homeland." The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" stated that "the people must know that our current submarine strength is sufficient to resist any enemy, and its terror is no less than it was during the Great War. Its equipment is very sophisticated and sufficient to handle any eventuality." (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Foreign Correspondents Praise the Effectiveness of China's New Strategy: Chinese and Japanese Forces Have Reached a State of Equilibrium; Chinese People Confident of Approaching Victory</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The soldiers and people in the Chinese interior feel confident that China's continued resistance will lead to victory. China has vast manpower and reserves, and the international situation is gradually becoming more favorable to China and less favorable to Japan. The extended front line has now reached a state of equilibrium with the Japanese army. The basis for "final victory will belong to China" lies in this. In the past six months, the Japanese side has made at least two gestures of peace, but Chiang Kai-shek has resolutely rejected them. Chinese soldiers are convinced that China is approaching the stage of victory and believe that if Japan cannot offer China acceptable terms, Japan will inevitably move towards defeat. However, from a foreign perspective, the longer China's resistance can be prolonged, the more favorable the peace terms it will obtain. China's strategy is extremely simple: it does not engage in decisive battles with the Japanese army. In other words, if the Japanese army launches a fierce attack on a certain point, the Chinese army on the front withdraws and attacks its flanks and rear. At the same time, the Chinese army's attacks are often multi-pronged, making it impossible for the Japanese to draw troops and concentrate them at one point. The Japanese army's inability to capture Changsha after occupying Nanchang is the result of this strategy. The terrain in the western provinces of China is extremely favorable to China. If the Japanese army can eliminate the Chinese guerrillas in Shanxi, it may be able to occupy Xi'an. If the Japanese army is determined to attack Beihai and Nanning, it may also be able to occupy them. At the same time, if the Japanese army is determined to open up the Canton-Hankou Railway, it may also be able to do so. It may also be possible to capture Guilin. However, the Japanese army's lines of communication will be further extended, which will allow the Chinese army's mobile strategy to be even more effective. As for the Japanese army's attempt to capture Chongqing, it is impossible under any circumstances. If the Japanese navy wants to sail up the river, even if the Chinese side offers no resistance, it would be "harder than ascending to heaven." If it takes the route through Hanzhong, it must engage in a long and arduous battle in terrain unfavorable to the Japanese. Even then, the chances of success are slim. At the very least, Japan must first defeat or eliminate China's main force before it has any hope of capturing Chongqing. But in fact, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese have never defeated China's main force. From now on, the Japanese army will have even less chance of defeating China's main force, because the Chinese strategy is not to engage the Japanese army in a decisive battle at any one point. At the same time, since the Nanyue Conference last November, one million troops have been sent to the occupied areas to engage in mobile warfare. More will continue to be sent in an endless stream to "turn the Japanese rear into the front," tying down Japanese troops and communication lines. The Chinese side believes that if this strategy is extended for a considerable period of time, it will inevitably cause the Japanese army to become weary of war, instill terror in the puppets, inspire patriotism in the farmers in the occupied areas, and cause Japan's financial resources to flow out endlessly, ultimately leading to Japan's economic collapse. Chinese economists believe that this economic collapse will likely become a reality within one or two years. According to Chinese estimates, the Japanese army's military expenses in China require 13 million yen per day. To date, Japan has issued 14,000,000,000 yen in public bonds and 2,850,000,000 yen in banknotes. Its gold reserves are nearing exhaustion. In terms of military strength, Japan also lacks sufficient allocation. On the one hand, it must defend against the Soviet Union, but the army that can be mobilized domestically is no more than seventeen divisions. The Chinese side believes that this is clear evidence that the Japanese military is approaching failure. This is the basis for the Chinese side's conviction of victory. The Chinese side also hopes for active international assistance, but the main focus is still on the Chinese side's strategy of attrition. Because it is a war of attrition, it will be a very long period. The Chinese side does not expect the war to end within one or two years. Their plan is to deal with Japan for at least four years, or even ten years, regardless of the years, forcing Japan to accept the Chinese conditions and resolve the Sino-Japanese War. (Associated Press correspondent, 24th)</p>
<p>(Kunming) An editorial in the Yishi Bao, a major newspaper in Kunming, today said that the current war is not only a war in the military sense, but also an economic war. Comparing the economic foundations of China and Japan, the newspaper concluded that China's economy is almost entirely based on agriculture, so the final victory of the economic war belongs to China. Some people are currently pessimistic because of the depreciation of the legal tender, but this is only one effect of the war and does not mean that China's economic foundation has been shaken. The newspaper also called for attention to the unreasonable price increases of domestic goods, saying that it should be remedied for the welfare of the Chinese people. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Counteroffensive of Chao-Shan; Zhang Fakui Personally Supervises Battle; Wu Qiwai's Troops Capture Chao'an; Cheng-Hai County Town Unfortunatly Falls Again</h3>
<p>Dian Dong Dispatch:  The battle in eastern Guangdong is in full swing.  Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, was ordered to inspect the Dong River. In mid-July, he commanded Wu Qiwai's troops in a three-pronged counteroffensive against Chao-Shan, regaining Chao'an City on the eleventh night and achieving a great victory. Hua Zhenzhong launched a counteroffensive against Shantou from Sangpu, retaking Pengzhou and Tuopu City with the speed of a gale sweeping away fallen leaves. Yuepu, Anbu, Longwei, Meixitou, and the soldiers and civilians of Ouding in Chenghai joined forces. Shantou's periphery was entirely controlled by the Chinese army, whose main force</p>
<p>had entered Chao City.</p>
<p>The Japanese army stubbornly defended Jinshan Middle School, Hulu Mountain Huatuo Temple, Yingzhou Hotel on Shangdong Embankment, Zhugao Mountain Guanbu Temple, and Bijia Mountain Han Shrine, with only over a hundred soldiers at each location, fighting for three days and nights. Twenty-six anti-war officers and soldiers imprisoned by the Japanese army in the Chao'an County Government were released by the Chinese army. As the Japanese army was becoming isolated, Japanese aircraft quickly came to their aid, dropping packages of dry food and incendiary bombs, causing fires to break out everywhere inside and outside the city. The Japanese army in Shantou rushed to rescue in three routes. At noon on the seventeenth, more than six hundred Japanese cavalry soldiers first charged into the southwest gate from the Hu Di Road, Chao-Shan Railway. Over thirty electric-powered speedboats, fully loaded with artillery, landed on the dike on the north gate. When the Chinese soldiers and civilians saw the arrival of Japanese reinforcements, they retreated towards Anjie Road, Fengxi, and Guxiang. On the eighteenth, fierce fighting broke out</p>
<p>along both sides of the railway.</p>
<p>The Chao'an County Government was temporarily located in Meigang on Anjie Road. The newly appointed County Magistrate, Wu Lutai, officially took office on the eighteenth. Zou Hong, Commander of the Chao-Mei Garrison, personally supervised the oath-taking ceremony. Zhang Fakui deployed the counteroffensive military affairs in the Huang (Fengshun) and Tangkeng (Jieyang) areas. On the eighteenth, the Japanese army went south through the waterway to rescue Shantou. Three hundred people landed on the Beilong Embankment and attacked Cheng-Hai City. The Chinese army garrison in Ouding urgently withdrew to Waisha, and Cheng City fell again. This was the fourth time it had fallen. Hua Zhenzhong's troops continued to defend Anbu and Pengzhou Institute, waiting for an opportunity. At this time, the Japanese army in Chao-Shan was weak, and two thousand soldiers boarded ships to attack Haifeng and Shanwei again. On the evening of the eighteenth, eight Japanese warships were discovered on the sea off Shanwei, firing artillery at Magong. Eight or nine aircraft also dropped bombs along the coast to cover the Japanese army's landing. That evening, they were repelled by the Chinese army. Zhang Fakui, feeling that the situation in the lower reaches of the Dong River was tense,</p>
<p>rushed there overnight</p>
<p>to direct operations in Yiyang. On the evening of the twentieth, the Japanese army landed on the beaches of Zhelang and Magong in Shanwei in two routes. The streets of Shanwei were bombed extremely severely. Fires broke out after the bombing, destroying over one hundred fish shops and stores. The Chinese army and civilians had long been prepared and fought back at every step, covering the retreat. Six hundred Japanese soldiers landed in Shanwei, and a portion landed in Aotou in Daya Bay. According to the Chinese plan, fierce fighting would begin in the mountains further away from the coast. Pingshan, Danshui, and Sanduo are now all heavily guarded.</p>

On the nineteenth, over five hundred soldiers of the Chinese army, led by Li, launched a strong offensive and successively recovered Renheji and Yuanzhuang. The Japanese army in Yangzhou forced the puppet pacification force to resist, but most of these puppet troops were forcibly conscripted from local strongmen. As soon as they engaged in battle, they revolted one after another. The puppet company commander was killed on the spot by the puppet troops. At the same time, the New Fourth Army also recovered the area around Yu Guan Bridge. The scattered Japanese troops there were all annihilated by the Chinese New Fourth Army.

<p>Yao Youlan Executed by the Chinese Forces</p>
<p>Qingpu Dispatch: Late at night on the twenty-second, the Second Detachment of the Chinese Patriotic Salvation Army launched a surprise attack on Qibao Town.

Before long, Zhaoxiang Town and over ten nearby villages were all recovered by the Chinese army.

On the other hand, he instructed Jin Letian, the "Chief of the First District," to mobilize sixty-three shops to plead with the Japanese to maintain Chen in his original position. Unexpectedly, this angered the Japanese army, who considered Chen to be cunning and deliberately obstructive. They suddenly dispatched Japanese soldiers to detain him.

<h3>Department of Education of Jiangsu Province Drafts Amendments to Regulations on the Establishment of Secondary Schools; Already Submitted to the Ministry of Education for Record and Implementation</h3>
<p>Since the successive falls of Jiangnan and Jiangdu, Rugao, Jingjiang, Nantong, and other counties, public and private secondary schools established in these areas have been relocated, either to Shanghai or northern Jiangsu, or the main school was moved to Shanghai while establishing a branch in northern Jiangsu, or the main school was moved north while establishing a branch in Shanghai. Even secondary schools in Shanghai established branches in northern Jiangsu. In northern Jiangsu, some schools were even hastily established in the name of providing relief for students who had lost their schooling and employment, disregarding the registration regulations and the supervisory powers of the county education administrative organs. Some even applied for registration with the Jiangsu Department of Education despite having empty facilities and no assets or funds. Schools and branches that relocated to northern Jiangsu often indiscriminately admitted unqualified students, employed unqualified teachers, had inconsistent curricula, and were on the verge of bankruptcy. When Ma Yuanfang took office as the head of the Jiangsu Department of Education last winter, he was saddened and worried by this phenomenon and urgently sought ways to rectify it. He personally inspected Jiangnan while instructing the secretaries and section chiefs to conduct detailed research based on the findings of school inspectors and to draft appropriate rectification measures for his selection and implementation. Ma returned to the department in early last month and reviewed and approved the measures drafted by the sections and secretaries. The main points are as follows: (1) All branches established by provincial, county, and private secondary schools must be merged and no longer have the situation where the main school is in northern Jiangsu and the branch is in Shanghai, or the main school is in Shanghai and the branch is in northern Jiangsu. (2) Public or private secondary schools in Shanghai that relocate to northern Jiangsu must be entrusted by the Shanghai authorities and be subject to the supervision of the Jiangsu Department of Education and the local county education bureau (section). (3) The registration of newly established private secondary schools must meet the registration conditions with the approved flexible measures. (4) County private junior secondary schools may not recruit senior high school students and add senior high school departments without authorization. (5) All senior high school departments that should be banned under these measures will be allowed to transfer their existing senior high school students to provincial temporary senior high schools or registered private secondary school senior high school departments, but they must undergo strict qualification review and placement tests. It is reported that these measures were submitted to the Ministry and Provincial Governments for record and implementation in late last month. The complete relocation of the main campus of Yangzhou Middle School in Jiangsu Province to Shanghai is being handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of these measures.</p>
<h3>Trends in Secondary Education in Northern Jiangsu; Four Temporary Secondary Schools and Four Normal Schools to be Established</h3>

<h3>Worth Noting: Japanese Military Leaders Visit Europe. Terauchi, Osumi, and others passed through Shanghai yesterday to go to Germany. The inside story of this trip is to conclude a broad alliance. The new agreement is rumored to involve military understanding to jointly strike against Germany, Italy, and Japan.</h3>
<p>Regarding the war clouds on the mainland, two of Japan's top military leaders, who are embarking on a journey to Berlin and Rome to hold historical military and political talks, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (24th) aboard the Kashima Maru. They will continue their journey to Europe today (25th). These two are former commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in North China and current military councilor Terauchi Hisaichi, and former Minister of the Navy and current military councilor Osumi Mineo. A large number of attendants are accompanying them. In addition, Isaka Takashi, one of Japan's leading industrialists and financiers, is also traveling with them. According to reliable information obtained by Continental News, Isaka and the president of the Japan Industrial Federation, along with other major industrialists, will sign a</p>
<p>Broad Commercial Agreement</p>
<p>with Germany in early October. These four Japanese leaders are ostensibly visiting Nuremberg, Germany at the invitation of Hitler to attend the National Socialist Party Congress on September 11. However, it is rumored that they are on a mission to conclude a broad alliance between Japan and its European allies. It is said that the Japanese ambassador to Germany, Oshima, has already obtained a preliminary understanding regarding a German-Japanese military agreement. However, Oshima's proposal was shelved by the army and moderates in Tokyo, fearing that this move would cause unnecessary and significant damage to Japan's foreign relations. However, the</p>
<p>European Situation</p>
<p>especially the start of the British-Soviet talks, as well as the strong pressure from the army's "radical elements", led Japan to change its attitude. As a result, it is said that a decision has been made to bring the informal talks in Berlin and Rome to a conclusion. The visit of these two military leaders to Berlin is not only the first time that Japan has sent a special envoy to Nuremberg to attend the congress, but also the fourth time in Japanese history that high-ranking military officers have been sent to Europe on a special mission. According to indirect news from Japan, Japanese newspapers greatly</p>
<p>Value</p>
<p>this visit to Fascist countries in Tokyo. Newspapers in Tokyo explicitly stated that this trip "will consolidate the Axis" and promote "mutual assistance between countries." News that the two financiers will sign a commercial agreement in Berlin is expected to increase German-Japanese trade as a result. Investigations reveal that negotiations for this agreement began eight months ago by the commercial counselor of the Japanese embassy in Germany. A preliminary agreement was reached in March, but negotiations</p>
<p>Stalled</p>
<p>due to the army's opposition to importing certain German goods. Now, the army seems to no longer oppose it. According to private news from Tokyo, most of the German goods imported by Japan will be military equipment, mainly cannons and airplanes. Currently, Japan is connected with Germany and Italy at least on the surface through the Anti-Comintern Pact and cultural agreements. The new agreement will link these three countries through far-reaching military and naval understandings. Yesterday morning, Terauchi and the other three representatives boarded the Izumo warship. The commander-in-chief of the Japanese forces stationed in Gonggu, Lieutenant General Oikawa, and the Japanese consulate and army and navy authorities in Shanghai also hosted banquets separately.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Women and Children Leaving Ningbo and Hong Kong are Relaxed, but the Export of Young Men is Still Strictly Prohibited. Emphasis is placed on procedures, but there is no limit on the number of people.</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai-Ningbo route was changed to load and unload passengers and cargo outside the Zhenhai estuary, it has been quite smooth. The German merchant Mou Fulun of the Lihe Foreign Company began his third voyage on the Ningbo line yesterday morning, leaving Zhenhai to return to Shanghai, arriving in Shanghai tonight. According to news from the Lihe shipping department, the ship is scheduled to continue sailing to Zhenhai the morning after tomorrow. Currently, the Ningbo defense department's restrictions on passenger entry and exit, except for the strict prohibition of young men leaving the country, have been relaxed compared to before. Therefore, for all ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, there will be no limit on the number of passengers traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo if the procedures are complete. The Haifu ship of the Lihe Foreign Company, which previously carried fellow villagers from Wenzhou to Shadi, stayed in Wenzhou waters for two days due to encountering a storm midway. It returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday morning. When the ship sailed to Shacheng, it carried a small amount of cargo. However, upon arriving in Shacheng, all passengers and cargo could not be loaded or unloaded due to obstruction by Japanese warships. Therefore, it has been transported back to Shanghai on the original ship. The plan for the ship to operate regularly on the Shacheng route has also been cancelled.</p>
<h3>The government is determined to maintain the legal tender in Shanghai with all its strength. The drastic changes in the foreign exchange market are being manipulated by speculators. Within the possible scope, it will still be maintained appropriately.</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has announced measures to prohibit the import of goods, measures for exporters to settle foreign exchange and receive exchange rate differences, and rules for applying for foreign exchange for imported goods, aiming to restrict the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods, encourage the export of major local products, and is determined to maintain the value of the legal tender with all its strength, and provide legal foreign exchange as much as possible. Regarding Shanghai in the occupied area, due to the government's inability to exercise power, speculators are manipulating and monopolizing the market, causing drastic changes in the black market for foreign exchange and gold, as well as improper operations such as exchange rate markups. Full preparations have now been made for the exercise of the legal tender in the occupied areas, and it will be firmly maintained. However, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai will still be maintained appropriately by the Stabilization Committee within the possible scope, and will be terminated if necessary, because it is detrimental to China's war of resistance. The situation in the Shanghai financial market is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Trends Towards Stability, Speculative Arbitrage</p>
<p>After being maintained, the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has stabilized. Yesterday morning, HSBC's listing was 4 shillings for the pound and 7.75 yuan for the US dollar, remaining the same as before, without any change. Although Japanese companies continued to push prices up, fortunately, due to Hong Kong's maintenance, the actual market rate was still relatively stable, with the pound at 4 shillings and 5 pence and the US dollar at 8.75 yuan. However, the arbitrage between forward and spot rates reached an astonishing level of adding one yesterday morning, that is, one yuan can be profited for every ten yuan. Those with strength are all engaged in this arbitrage speculation.</p>
<p>Securities Black Market Rises Across the Board</p>
<p>Because all parties confirmed that the principal and interest of the unified public bonds due at the end of July, although the Ministry of Finance declared that payments were suspended, the four banks of Zhongzhong, Jiaonong, etc. allowed discounts and borrowings, so the black market rebounded. At the close of trading yesterday morning, Type A unified bonds were 51.9 yuan, up 1.3 yuan; Type B was 43.3 yuan, up 1.15 yuan; Type C was 42 yuan, up 8.5 cents; Type D was 41 yuan, up 8 cents; and Type E was 41.55 yuan, up 7 cents.</p>
<p>Gold Gradually Levels Off, Markup Returns</p>
<p>After the gold black market meeting opened yesterday morning, prices still fluctuated drastically. The morning closing price was 3,570 yuan, down 30 yuan compared to the morning closing price the day before yesterday. The afternoon closing price was 3,670 yuan, up 120 yuan compared to the afternoon closing price the day before yesterday. The Hangpai of Yinlou Datongxing was 355 yuan in the morning and 370 yuan in the afternoon. As for the exchange rate markup, it was between 220 yuan and 230 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bank Deposits Begin to be Returned</h3>
<p>Entrusted by the Shanghai Banks United Preparatory Association Bill Exchange Office, the Shanghai Municipal Bank and the Shanghai Industrial and Trust Company are acting as agents for the bank and company to return deposits, with as many as 3,300 households. Currently, most depositors have completed registration with the office, and payments have begun at the office since July 21. All deposit principal and interest are paid in legal tender, and the interest on various deposits is still generous, so depositors are not at a disadvantage. However, the board of directors and supervisors of the bank and company previously approved by the Ministry of Finance that all deposits above 300 yuan must be returned in installments in accordance with the measures to stabilize finance, and deposits below 300 yuan will be returned in one lump sum. Therefore, the office can only strictly verify the payments. However, according to staff at the office, the thousands of depositors in the Municipal Bank and Xingye Trust Company mostly have small savings deposits, so most of them can be paid in one lump sum.</p>
<h3>The Rickshaw Pullers Association Requests Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Association", organized by representatives of rickshaw pullers in various districts of the city, in order to oppose the illegal increase of rickshaw rent by rickshaw owners, and to request the implementation of a 30% rent reduction, as well as the abolition of the rickshaw puller registration "application form", specially sent four representatives yesterday morning at 9:00 am, carrying a petition, to the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors on Jiangxi Road, Sanma Road.</p>
<h3>The New Commander of the US Fleet, Hepte, Took Office Yesterday Morning. US officials all attended the grand ceremony. Hepte's speech praised the achievements of his predecessor. It is said that Yarnall will be transferred to serve as a special commissioner in the Philippines.</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Hepte, who was ordered to come to Shanghai to take office as the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, held an inauguration ceremony on the flagship Augusta yesterday morning. Hepte's chief of staff, Carell, also took office as the chief of staff of the Asiatic Fleet at the same time. After Commander Yarnall leaves for the United States on August 1, Hepte will take the flagship to North China for his first inspection after taking office. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Ceremony</p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony of Rear Admiral Hepte as the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet was held at 9:30 am yesterday morning on the US flagship Augusta. The ceremony was quite grand. First, Rear Admiral Hepte and Commander Yarnall shook hands, and then the flag of Commander Yarnall was lowered, and the flag of Rear Admiral Hepte, the naval flag of Rear Admiral Hepte, which was blue with seven white stars, was raised. After the flag-raising ceremony, Commander Yarnall first read the order of his removal from office, and Rear Admiral Hepte then read the order of his inauguration, stating that he had taken office as the commander of the Asiatic Fleet, and delivered a brief and to-the-point inauguration speech. After taking office, Rear Admiral Hepte was promoted to admiral. Carell, the chief of staff who came with Rear Admiral Hepte, also replaced Conner as the chief of staff of the Asiatic Fleet at the same time. The ceremony lasted half an hour before it was completed. In addition to all the officers and men of the flagship Augusta, important US officials in Shanghai, such as Consul General Coss, Commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet Grassford, Colonel Figen of the 4th Marine Regiment, and the wives of the two commanders and Mrs. Carell, all attended the grand ceremony.</p>
<p>Inauguration Speech</p>
<p>Commander Hepte said in his inauguration speech, "General Yarnall has served as the commander of the Asiatic Fleet for almost two years. During his tenure, his handsome, tenacious spirit and perseverance in serving the Asiatic Fleet are admirable. As Commander Yarnall is about to leave Shanghai, I dare to say to Commander Yarnall in the position of colleague and friend, I will continue Commander Yarnall's plan and move forward, so that I will be worthy of the duties of our soldiers."</p>
<p>Brief Service History</p>
<p>According to the records, Commander Hepte was born in Davis, Michigan, USA in 1877, and is currently 62 years old. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1899. From 1920 to 1922, he served as the commander of the Far East Submarine. From 1922 to 1927, he was promoted to captain of the US battleship Mississippi. In 1929, he was promoted to rear admiral and led the fleet to station in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans successively. In 1935, he served as the chairman of the General Committee of the Naval Department in Washington. He was just relieved of his duties in June of this year. Rear Admiral Hepte participated in the Spanish-American War, when he was responsible for the defense of the Cuban sea. When World War I broke out, he was the commander of the fleet in the As River in England. He made special achievements in these two battles. His term as commander of the Asiatic Fleet will last until July 1, 1941, when Commander Hepte will be 64 years old.</p>
<p>Yar's Return to China</p>
<p>After Rear Admiral Yarnall steps down, he will stay in Shanghai for about a week to pack his luggage and say goodbye to his friends. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge on August 2 and return to the United States to report to President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt values ​​Yar very much and it is said that he will be given the post of senior commissioner to the Philippines to replace McNutt. One theory is that Yar will be temporarily transferred to the Naval Department in Washington for service. Commander Hepte will take the flagship Augusta to North China for his first inspection after taking office after seeing Yarnall off to the United States.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Records</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News said, "A ceremony was held on the US warship Augusta this (25th) morning, where General Yarnall will hand over his position as commander of the US Asiatic Fleet to his successor, General Hett. Those who attended included Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Patrol Fleet, his chief of staff, Colonel Figen, commander of the US 4th Marine Regiment, and US Consul General Coss in Shanghai. At 9:30 am, the official handover was held on the deck of the Augusta. The officers and soldiers of the flagship and a team of Marines stood by. After General Ya saluted, he read the removal order and delivered a farewell speech to the Asiatic Fleet. Then General Ya's flag was lowered and replaced with General He's flag. General He briefly delivered a few words after he read the order issued by President Roosevelt appointing him as commander of the Asiatic Fleet, and warmly shook hands with General Ya. General Ya then met with his successor. About half an hour later, General Ya had taken off his military uniform, put on a light yellow casual wear, and wore a light straw hat. He left his flagship for the last time, accompanied by his staff member Conner in casual clothes. When he entered the speedboat, the band played and the officers and soldiers cheered. General Ya is scheduled to take the President Coolidge wheel back to the United States on August 2."</p>

<h3>The Market Closed Early, the Rice Market Experienced Black Market Trading, The Market Was Chaotic and Hoarders Did Not Care, The Authorities Sent Personnel to the Scene to Give Earnest Explanations</h3>
<p>Due to hoarders pushing up prices and people outside the industry speculating and manipulating the market, insisting on not selling the purchased goods, the transactions were chaotic. All grades of rice were uniformly raised to the current price, which was not in line with the principle of separate arrangements stipulated by the authorities in the concession. Top-grade and special-grade rice were nowhere to be found in the markets, and black market transactions occurred. However, those engaged in black market transactions were completely private, with no transaction receipts, aiming to avoid punishment by the authorities. At 9:00 am yesterday morning, the Fuzhou Road Rice Market of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association opened, and people were crowded and noisy. The whole market was filled with shouts of pushing up prices. The market price rose yesterday morning, and the number of transactions was only two or three tenths of the usual amount, almost having a market but no transactions, and the market was at a standstill. The management committee members took turns to persuade people, but the hoarders were calm and unmoved, causing the market to be forced to close early.</p>
<p>Retail Sales in Stores, Unified Price</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Dagangshe, the Shanghai Rice Dealers Association, in view of the fact that the transaction price of rice in the Shanghai rice market has exceeded the maximum limit, making it impossible to purchase, the price of rice sold retail in the rice stores is now the same as when it was purchased in the market. If the retail price is increased, it will affect people's food, and if it is too low, the cost will be a loss. Therefore, in order to take into account the livelihood of ordinary people, the association, in addition to reporting the current market situation to the concession authorities for correction as soon as possible, also unifies the retail price of rice in the stores of its members, distinguishing the quality of the rice, and includes military commissions, etc., in order to maintain business.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Go to the Scene to Explain</p>
<p>Since the Public Concession Engineering Bureau stipulated the price limit for Guomi, the highest grade of white rice should not exceed 20 yuan, and the highest grade of Ke Xian should not exceed 16 yuan. In view of the soaring price of rice in the market, in addition to sending personnel to strictly investigate and allowing anyone to report the facts at any time for the purpose of taking action and prosecuting the matter, at 11:00 am yesterday, it sent personnel to the market to explain the meaning of the authorities' price limit to 105 firms and hoped that rice merchants would abide by it consistently.</p>
<p>Anhui Province Embargo, Jiangsu Smoothly Flows</p>
<p>The amount of rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday (1) There were more than ten ships coming down the river, (2) Five or six trains came, (3) More than 3,000 packages were loaded by ship, and the total was about 5,000 packages. However, the rice merchants from Wuhu were not allowed to issue removal certificates due to Japanese obstruction. Although the rice merchants repeatedly negotiated, it has not been resolved so far. Therefore, the rice shipped from Wuhu to Shanghai has disappeared. However, although the bottom line of Shanghai's entire people's food has slightly decreased, the season for new rice to enter the market is approaching, and there will be no panic of shortage.</p>
<h3>The Situation Suddenly Became Tense in the Counterattack of the Chinese Army on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line, the War in the Xichang Area Was Quite Fierce, and Highway Traffic Was Obstructed</h3>
<p>Since the East Battlefield Military Authority actively equipped the guerrilla army along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line, trained strong soldiers, eliminated the old and weak, and assisted the masses to thoroughly eliminate bandits, it has been very active in various counties and districts near the line, which has caused extreme unease to the Japanese side. Frequent mobilization has been carried out in recent days to strengthen the road protection force. The Japanese army in various county and city defenses has closed the city gates in the evening due to insufficient manpower.</p>
<p>Joint Counterattack on All Routes</p>
<p>The number of counterattacking troops in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, Taicang, Kunshan, and Qingpu is more than 40,000, led by Mei Guangdi, Zhu Shouhua, Ren Tianshi, Wang Shilai, etc. The Chinese army on all routes, currently commanded by Deng Muyin, the commander-in-chief of the Jiangsu guerrilla army, has begun a counterattack since the 23rd of this month. The war has been quite fierce, and the progress of the three counties of Xichang and Tai has been the fastest. The vanguard commando of the Chinese army has advanced to the surrounding area four or five miles away from the city to deploy defenses, and will make a plan to attack the city after responding to the rear troops. Slogans of the Chinese army have now been found inside and outside the city, and the Japanese puppet army is extremely panic-stricken.</p>
<p>Traffic Obstruction, Commercial Depression</p>
<p>After military operations occurred in various counties along the line, traffic suddenly became blocked. The traffic on the Shanghai-Xichang Highway, from Baimao Station in Changshu to Yangjian Station in Wuxi, and on the Qingkun Highway has been cut off from time to time. Automobile and transportation companies carrying goods have stopped one after another, and Japanese merchants have also shortened the distance of their passenger and freight cars, mostly changing to water transportation. Due to the serious situation in the interior, residents have moved away, and business is extremely depressed. All goods that have been ordered in Shanghai have been notified to postpone shipment.</p>
<h3>New Port of Northern Jiangsu Will Soon Be Recaptured</h3>
<p>People from Northern Jiangsu said that in the past month, the guerrillas in Northern Jiangsu have been cooperating with the regular army to fight against the Japanese army, and the fighting has been exceptionally fierce everywhere, with victories in every battle. The Lianshui and Huai'an areas have been recaptured successively, all because General Li plans day and night and personally commands the front line in every battle, so the soldiers and generals are willing to work hard and have repeatedly made great achievements. Recently, in order to take the real to attack the unreal, they have turned to the area along the river. The Japanese army is weak and exceptionally panicked. The Chinese army has taken advantage of the victory to seize various port strongholds and is invincible. The new port has been occupied by the Japanese army for a long time. It is said that our army is now actively advancing.</p>
<h3>Methods for Exchanging Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan Local Currency Notes Now in Effect; Payment Made with Drafts from Original Locations or Chongqing; Other Foreign Currency Notes Still Accepted at Full Value</h3>
<p>Following instructions from the head offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications regarding the exchange of local currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan, the Shanghai branches of the two banks issued a notice yesterday to comply. Regardless of small or large amounts, all notes will be paid with immediate drafts from the original issuing location or Chongqing, and holders will be allowed to use the drafts to purchase local goods in the interior. However, notes from other regions will continue to be accepted as usual. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Banks Issue Notice: Two Measures</p>
<p>The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications announced yesterday: "We received instructions from the head office regarding the currency notes issued by our Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan branches. After verification, the following measures have been approved: (1) All unredeemed notes with the names of China, Communications, Tianjin, Shandong, and Communications Bank Wuhan notes will be paid with immediate drafts payable in the original issuing location or Chongqing (without exchange fees). (2) To facilitate noteholders' purchase of local goods in the interior, we will also consider offering free remittance services to the interior." We will comply accordingly. This notice is issued on July 25th, the 28th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Currency Notes from Other Locations: Accepted Universally</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications that the exchange of currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan is handled by all branches and offices in Shanghai, in addition to the Shanghai branches of the two banks. However, this is limited to Tianjin and Shandong Province, including Jinan, Yantai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Wuhan. As for currency notes from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other locations, they can still be used as usual and are not subject to the above two measures. All banks and financial institutions in Shanghai also fully accept and circulate currency notes from regions other than Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan.</p>
<p>Methods for Nanyang Bank Currency Notes</p>
<p>Currency notes issued by various commercial banks have been taken over by the Currency Issuance Reserve Management Committee: (1) The Central Bank has taken over the Zhongnan, China Agricultural and Industrial, and Siming banks. (2) The Bank of China has taken over the China General Chamber of Commerce and Agricultural and Commercial banks. (3) The Bank of Communications has taken over the Zhejiang Xingye, China Reclamation, and China Industrial banks. The currency notes of the above banks are still allowed to be used as usual. However, currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan can also be exchanged at the three banks (China, Communications, and Central) that have taken over, with the same procedures.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Currency Notes: Accepted at Full Value</p>
<p>Currency notes issued by the Zhejiang Local Bank in Hangzhou should be accepted at full value as usual. Since the rejection of currency notes from North China, there has been a misunderstanding about the bank's currency notes, and they have also been rejected. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai branch of the bank that, in order to maintain its credit, the bank has instructed its Shanghai branch to redeem the notes without limitation. Therefore, noteholders who wish to exchange for Shanghai currency notes can apply at the branch at 381 Jiangxi Road. Furthermore, the bank's currency notes are accepted by all banks and financial institutions in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Various Banks Accept for Remittance to the Interior</p>
<p>Various banks in Shanghai, such as Xinhua Bank, have accepted remittances in currency notes from North China and Wuhan. Businesses or individuals who wish to remit money to the interior can use currency notes from the above locations to remit to the interior. The same applies to purchasing local goods in the interior. In addition, it has been reported that some small financial institutions are taking the opportunity to accept currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan, charging a discount of 5 cents to 20 cents per yuan. After collecting these notes, these small financial institutions then exchange them for remittance to the interior, aiming to profit.</p>
<p>Public Confidence Stabilized After Implementation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, some people still went to the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications requesting to exchange currency notes from other locations. The two banks, in addition to handling Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan currency notes according to the two measures instructed by the head office, continued to exchange currency notes from other locations as usual. After explanations from the two banks, noteholders understood deeply and changed to remitting to the interior. As a result, the amount of remittances to the interior received by the China and Communications banks yesterday increased slightly compared to previous days. Preferential treatment was given by waiving remittance fees. After the morning, no noteholders requested exchange, proving that public confidence has stabilized.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Newspaper Attack Case: Japanese Sources Claim Attackers Were Supporters of Chongqing, but Fail to Provide Concrete Evidence</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that regarding the shooting on Edinburgh Road (now Nanjing East Road) that resulted in four deaths and twenty injuries, a Japanese spokesperson made statements at a press conference yesterday (24th) that contradicted newspaper reports. According to the spokesperson, the Japanese authorities received information that the attackers were terrorists supporting Chongqing, attempting to create friction between the Shanghai Municipal Council (under British influence) and the Japanese authorities in order to hinder the smooth negotiations currently taking place in Tokyo. A reporter asked what the motive would be for terrorists supporting Chongqing to attack newspapers that enthusiastically support</p>
<p>the Chongqing Government.</p>
<p>The spokesperson replied that the matter is currently under investigation by the police. However, it has been said that the attacks on the two newspapers were the result of their recent reduction in anti-Japanese sentiment. A reporter pointed out that one of the attacked newspapers had received numerous threatening letters from a group claiming that if the newspaper did not change its attitude, its building would be destroyed. The attack occurred a few days after the newspaper published articles from the Chongqing authorities. Another reporter asked if the Japanese authorities considered</p>
<p>this matter serious.</p>
<p>The spokesperson replied that considering the widespread rumors that Chinese were planning to assassinate British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr in order to obstruct the successful conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo, this matter is serious. A reporter asked, if any evidence is obtained proving that the terrorists are related to a certain group, will the Japanese authorities cooperate with the police to arrest the perpetrators? The spokesperson replied that it is first necessary to have proof. As stated repeatedly, the Japanese military authorities are deeply concerned about maintaining</p>
<p>peace and order</p>
<p>in the concessions. If any individuals are found to be in conflict with the Japanese policy and their guilt is proven, the Japanese authorities will naturally cooperate in suppressing them. A reporter asked if the spokesperson had more concrete information regarding the claim that the terrorists were instructed by the Chinese government. The spokesperson replied, "Why don't you ask the police where they obtained their information?" Or ask if the terrorists in question are hiding in the demilitarized zone next to Edinburgh Road.</p>
<p>This fact,</p>
<p>do the Japanese authorities know it? The spokesperson replied that they did not know, and denied that the Public Concession authorities had discussed with the Japanese authorities the arrest of armed rioters hiding in the "Great Way" area. Or ask, did Japanese military police and the police hold a meeting the day after the armed rioters fired on a police search team on Edinburgh Road on July 2nd? The spokesperson replied that the Japanese authorities received a report of this meeting. A reporter asked if the seriousness of the shooting on Edinburgh Road was sufficient to allow the Japanese side to implement its policy of participating in maintaining peace and order in the Public Concession. The spokesperson replied that in this sense, the case is not serious. However, the details of the matter are not yet clear.</p>
<h3>Vigilance Line Near Chang Geng Li</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that special police guard teams and plainclothes personnel recently set up a vigilance line at the scene of the Edinburgh Road (i.e., near Chang Geng Li) shooting on Saturday and Sunday nights, due to a letter warning that riots may break out there again this afternoon (25th).</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economy Announces List of Prohibited Goods</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economy recently issued a notice to the provincial and municipal governments and chambers of commerce, stating that the goods in Article 2, Section 1, Item 2 of the Regulations on the Prohibition of Japanese Goods should be investigated and announced by the Ministry in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of the same article. The list of these goods, trademarks, etc., has been compiled and published as a category for prohibition. It has now been further verified that fifty companies in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other locations, including Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd., are all invested and operated by Japanese merchants, and the goods they produce should be announced as prohibited in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations on the Prohibition. In addition to listing the locations of the manufacturers to be prohibited, product trademarks, etc., and submitting them to the Executive Yuan for record, and issuing a ministry order to announce the prohibition, the Shanghai industry associations should inform their members that they must not purchase these goods. If there are any violations, they are allowed to report to the government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Earnest Handling of Draft Applications</h3>
<p>After the Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee handled the issuance of drafts for interbank use, various banks and financial institutions provided property reserves to apply to the committee for issuance and circulation in the market. In order to prevent general hoarding of goods, which leads to soaring prices and affects people's livelihoods, the committee decided to handle the issuance of drafts for interbank use earnestly, depending on the asset and business conditions of each bank and financial institution. Regarding the allocation of a total of 50 million yuan in drafts, it is limited to the actual needs of each bank and financial institution. However, there is no designation of how much for the China, Communications, and Central banks, and how much for the commercial banks. However, it is tentatively assumed that 10 million yuan is for the financial industry. The financial industry association has sent letters to its member financial institutions, limiting them to report the required amount within two days. It is reported that 42 financial institutions have filled out forms, with the maximum being 500,000 yuan and the minimum being 200,000 yuan. As for the remittance preparation inspection committee jointly formed by the municipal chamber of commerce and other five organizations, it is about to convene a committee meeting to implement the inspection.</p>

<h3>Garbage Transported to Zhabei, Suddenly Detained; Shanghai Municipal Council, at the Request of the Japanese Side, Transported the Garbage to Fill Land; Detained by the Pseudo-Regime Under Direct Order; British Consul Demands Release of Detained Western Employees</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Works Department, at the request of the Japanese Marines, dispatched a large working team yesterday (24th), consisting of 28 trucks and one private car, carrying garbage from the Public Concession to Zhabei to fill low-lying land. Before dusk, they were suddenly detained under the order of "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an. The people were detained at the Jiangwan Police Station of the "Shanghai Special Municipality," including English supervisor Ross, German Bielutz, and a White Russian driver who rented a truck. The trucks were detained at Bazhi Bridge, and are still being detained this morning (25th). The whole</p>
<p>Background of the Incident</p>
<p>is that the "Special Municipality" demanded payment of fees. Personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Council, with the assistance of officers from the Japanese Marines, negotiated last night in order to release the people. It is reported that the filling of low-lying land with garbage from the Public Concession has been going on for many months. One of the low-lying areas, the one that crosses the railway line from Jiangwan and enters Hongkou Park, is one of them. The Shanghai Municipal Council used to pay the Shanghai Municipal Government 120,000 yuan annually, with a special permission to dump part of the garbage into the Huangpu River. Since the Municipal Government moved, the Shanghai Municipal Council has</p>
<p>Stopped Paying This Fee.</p>
<p>However, two weeks ago, Chuan made a request, not only demanding this fee, but also demanding the "arrears" for the past two years. Therefore, the Works Department stopped dumping garbage into the Huangpu River. Now, although Ross and others are working on behalf of the Japanese Marines, they are still being detained, which is a deliberate move by the "Special Municipality" to extort 240,000 yuan from the Shanghai Municipal Council. The detained vehicles include 12 trucks from the Works Department, 16 rented trucks, and one private car. The keys to start the engines of each vehicle were</p>
<p>Taken Away Yesterday.</p>
<p>British Consul Kitson protested to the Japanese Consul General today regarding the illegal detention of Ross, in order to ensure Ross's immediate release. It is reported that filling low-lying land with garbage is an extremely safe and hygienic measure. For the past fifteen years, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been doing this at the request of the landlords, otherwise the landlords would have to purchase sludge to fill the land. Recently, a large number of artificial hills in Zhao Feng Park were also built using this method. The Works Department uses</p>
<p>Garbage for Filling</p>
<p>and mixes it with sludge and a thick slurry made from dust from yarn factories. This slurry can prevent insects and their larvae from escaping. After being poured into low-lying areas, the heat under the slurry can not only kill insects and their larvae, but can truly eliminate past ills. Therefore, if one thinks that garbage is simply placed on the ground and attracts flies and insects, then one is completely mistaken.</p>
<h3>Postal Worker Subsidies</h3>
<p>The Bureau Agrees to Provide Relief Funds</p>
<p>Recently, the price of goods has become expensive, and the impact on the lives of the general public is not insignificant. Even postal workers, who have always been known for their relatively good treatment, are feeling the pinch. Therefore, they submitted a request to the Postal Administration a month ago, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Communications for approval to allocate living allowance funds to help them. It is now heard that the Postal Administration has telegraphed Shanghai, but the amount has not been determined. It is reported that the Shanghai Postal Authority, sympathizing with the suffering of its employees, has agreed to temporarily issue temporary relief funds at the end of this month before the Postal Administration determines the amount to be issued, while awaiting instructions from the Postal Administration. All employees, although in this difficult situation, still maintain their long-standing firm belief, deeply understand the difficulties of the times, and can also understand the sincere efforts of the Shanghai Postal Authority. Various rumors are absolutely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>The Communication Office of the Employees of the Two Railways: Never Fails to Work</h3>
<p>The Communication Office of the Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways was established by representatives elected by all the evacuated employees of the two railways. It has been working for nearly two years and has achieved remarkable results. Previously, there were rumors that the office would be closed due to financial problems, and the employees were all afraid. In reality, the representatives in charge have consistently implemented the spirit of struggle and strived for the welfare of all evacuated employees. Currently, there are more than 5,000 employees trapped in the isolated island, and their lives are extremely painful and their situation is miserable. It is heard that Lin Kanghou and Yu Qiaqing have expressed deep sympathy for the plight of the evacuated employees of the two railways and the enthusiasm and facilities of the office in running around to seek help. They are now appealing for relief on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Between Two Branches of Brothers Over the Estate of the Ancestral Righteous Estate; Continued Hearing Yesterday Adjourned</h3>
<p>Cheng Zhonghan, Cheng Zhongjie, Cheng Zhongqi, Cheng Zhonggan, and Cheng Hongji, five brothers from Suzhou who are currently staying at the Wanyuan Hotel, jointly hired lawyers such as Huang Jiyuan to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court against their cousins Cheng Zeheng (a lawyer residing at 533 Avenue Haig), Cheng Huting (residing at 41 Avenue Foch), Cheng Yinwu, and Cheng Fuchen for jointly</p>
<p>Breach of Trust and Embezzlement</p>
<p>of more than 100,000 yuan of the common property of the Righteous Estate. According to the indictment, their ancestor, named Lan (Chongzhai Gong), established the Chengxun Righteous Estate during his lifetime to provide relief to the poor and support the clan. At that time, the amount of property set up was quite large, but since the first defendant took over, no notices were ever given to the clan members, and the contents, annual income and expenses, were never accounted for. Repeated requests to check the accounts were always</p>
<p>excused and delayed.</p>
<p>Only in 1935, after the plaintiffs requested to issue the surplus funds of the Righteous Estate of 150,000, was it distributed to each branch. As a result, only 30,000 yuan was received, and 120,000 yuan was withheld by the defendants and not delivered. Before 1935, when the mother of the first defendant, Wang, managed the estate, she withdrew 110,000 yuan without authorization to establish An Ding Middle School. This action was not approved by the clan members and not only violated the rules of the estate, but the school is still</p>
<p>operating in the occupied area,</p>
<p>and the accounts are never disclosed, which is even more obviously using the name of running a school to raise money and enrich oneself. The total amount of Righteous Estate funds embezzled is about 400,000. In addition, the interest from the Yanyi Gongxian two public fields managed by the defendants has always been issued monthly to support the lives of clan members. Now they have been repeatedly urged to no avail. According to the fixed amount, there are more than ten months, amounting to more than 3,000 yuan. A request is made to investigate according to the law. The case was heard once, but because the defendants did not arrive, the hearing was adjourned. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Kechou</p>
<p>Continued the Hearing.</p>
<p>Only Cheng Zeheng and Cheng Huting, two defendants, arrived in court. The plaintiffs and their lawyers arrived in court and stated the previous situation. According to the first defendant, Cheng Zeheng, he took over in 1935. Since August 13th, the Righteous Estate has had no income. The account book was handed over in January of this year. After the court inquired in detail, the hearing was adjourned to another date. The defendant was released on bail, and the defense lawyer was allowed to bail him out.</p>
<h3>Married Daughter Sues for Property Division; Claims Sister-in-Law and Nieces Embezzled</h3>
<p>Zhou Fuguo, a local woman residing at 8, Lane 111, Avenue Road, near hired lawyer Zhang Deqin, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against her nephews Fu Zuxin (currently residing at 3, Mingde Village, Rue Kim), Fu Zufeng, Fu Zuyuan, and her sister-in-law Fu Houqin (the legal representative of the defendant), to</p>
<p>Divide the Estate.</p>
<p>It is said that the defendant Fu Zuxin's father, namely the husband of the defendant Fu Houqin, Xiangxian, and the plaintiff were siblings born to the same father. Because their father died early, all family affairs were first managed by their grandfather, Guiyuan Gong. After the grandfather passed away, all family affairs and estate were managed by Xiangxian. Unexpectedly, Xiangxian passed away on December 8, 1938, and the defendants</p>
<p>Illegally Embezzled</p>
<p>the property left by Guiyuan Gong and ignored the life of the plaintiff's mother, Tao. It is found that the estate should be inherited by the plaintiff and her late brother Xiangxian in equal halves, and should not be arbitrarily seized. Now, in addition to the fields and properties in the occupied area, which are temporarily difficult to manage, the share of 10,000 yuan in the Yuyuan Heng Foreign Goods Company and the share of 16,500 yuan in the Yongfeng Grain Company in the special area should not be further seized. Therefore, she requested to be granted</p>
<p>Half of the Estate,</p>
<p>18,250 yuan, etc. According to the indictment, the court was presided over by Judge Li at the Civil Division Seven Court yesterday. Neither party was present. The lawyer representing the plaintiff stated the previous situation. The lawyer representing the defendant then responded to each point. The court then stated that it was necessary to summon witnesses and adjourned the hearing to August 11.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Carrying Guns</h3>
<p>At 7:30 yesterday morning, detectives from the French Police, while searching pedestrians at the intersection of Rue Cardinal Mercier and Avenue Road, noticed two men riding bicycles. Due to their hurried appearance, they stepped forward to search them. They found a pistol on each of the two men, so they returned to the police station to detain them for investigation. It is heard that they were planning to take action at a certain number on Rue Cardinal Mercier. The truth of the matter is still being investigated by the police.</p>
<h3>Gangster Sentenced for Extortion</h3>
<p>Song Xigen, an unemployed gangster, invited his apprentice Wang Jinfa (i.e., Xiao Ma Pi) on the 11th of this month. That night, they carried back a small coffin from the wilderness. A threatening letter was glued to the coffin lid and placed at the entrance of the Juji Zhuangyuan Restaurant on Avenue Edward VII in an attempt to extort 50 yuan in national currency from the restaurant, but failed. They were arrested and sent to the Special First Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang sentenced Song Xigen to one year and two months in prison for attempted extortion, and Wang Jinfa to six months in prison, to be sent to a reformatory.</p>
<h3>French Police Crack Down on Gambling Den; Arrest Three Criminals for Investigation</h3>
<p>Pan Xuezhi, a Jingjiang native who trades in duck and chicken eggs, recently transported a large batch of duck and chicken eggs to Shanghai from his hometown for sale, receiving more than 6,000 yuan. This was learned by Tang Yiming (39 years old, from Nantong), Shi Jinquan (45 years old, from Nanjing), and Tian Zanliang (30 years old, from Zhenjiang), who specialize in gambling for a living. Taking the opportunity, they tricked Pan into gambling in a room at 2, Lane 10, Hongyu Fang, Zhengjia Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, on the pretext of asking about the route to Jiangbei. Xiao Zhang, a person from Anhui, claiming to be Young Master Ma, also entered the game. For the first ten or so rounds, Pan Xuezhi won. But by the eighteenth round, Pan was heavily in debt, losing more than 1,000 yuan. The French Police learned of this and dispatched detectives to arrest Tang and the other two, and seized more than ten bundles of legal tender in a small leather suitcase in the room. Only the top bill was genuine, and the rest were waste paper. There is no doubt that this was a planned fraud. The case was sent to the Criminal Division One of the Special Second Court yesterday. The police lawyer requested a postponement, stating that Xiao Zhang, an accomplice from Anhui, was at large and that the case still needed to be investigated. Judge Miao asked the three defendants briefly and announced that the hearing would be adjourned to August 3.</p>
<h3>Pharmacy Employee Forges Invoices, Embezzles Money, and Flees, but is Arrested</h3>
<p>Shen Hexiang, a young man from Chaozhou, only 19 years old, was a salesman at Heji Pharmacy, Room 105, Qingyun Building. The pharmacy had dealings with Huamei Pharmacy at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road. Usually, after Heji sent goods to Huamei, the person in charge of Huamei would sign and stamp the invoice, and then Heji would take the invoice to the accounting room of Huamei to collect the payment. This was the usual practice. Recently, Shen became addicted to dancing, which led to insufficient income and heavy debts, which he could not make up for. So he recently forged an invoice from Heji for 1,403 yuan and 20 cents, and at the same time forged the signature of the person in charge of Huamei, and fraudulently obtained the money from the accounting room of Huamei, and then disappeared without a trace. After Huamei discovered this, they reported it to the General Police Department. After investigation by Detective Feng Qishan, Shen was arrested on the previous day in Room 204 of the Dachunghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division One of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a lawsuit according to Articles 210 and 339 of the Criminal Law. After interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned for one week.</p>
<h3>Enticing Women From Good Families To Prostitute; Zhang Changgui Sentenced to Six Months</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhuqing, also known as Zhang Changgui, from Zhenjiang, opened a brothel at 5, Lane 35, Xinzha Road, forcing prostitutes to receive customers and taking profits from them. On October 10 of last year, when Zhang returned to his hometown, it happened that a woman named Wang was too poor to make a living. So, she mortgaged her 17-year-old daughter, Wang Xiuying, to Zhang, stating that the term was three years and the price was 180 yuan. At the same time, Zhang also tricked a 35-year-old woman, Wang Xiufeng, into coming to Shanghai and placed her in the brothel he opened, forcing her to live the life of a prostitute. From then on, both women fell into hell, suffering deeply, and all the money they earned was taken by Zhang. Wang Xiufeng found this kind of human hell unbearable, so she took the opportunity to escape and reported to the police. West Patrolman Fangte and Hua Sandao Tou No. 1013 went to investigate and found out the truth. On the previous day, they arrested Zhang Zhuqing and Wang Xiuying together and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division Two of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang charged Zhang with the crime of disturbing public morals according to Article 231 of the Criminal Law and stated the facts of the case. He also presented the testimony of Wang Xiuying and Wang Xiufeng about being forced to receive customers. When questioned, Zhang's confession was evasive. Judge Chuan sentenced Zhang Zhuqing to six months' imprisonment for attempting to profit by enticing a woman from a good family to commit adultery. If he converted it to a fine, it would be calculated at one yuan per day. Wang Xiuying was temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care, pending her mother's arrival to claim her.</p>

<h3>Jewish Refugee, Lauter, Employs Launch to Commit Suicide in River; Jewelery Business in Shanghai Suspected of Financial Difficulty</h3>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily News on the 25th reported that a foreign gentleman, elegantly dressed, hired a launch at the Customs Wharf on the Bund yesterday at 3 pm, with a clear rental of four hours for 20 yuan, which was paid immediately. The captain of the launch then set off downstream of the Huangpu River. Initially, it was thought that he was an officer from a foreign warship. Unexpectedly, the foreigner suddenly jumped into the water in the middle of the river. Consequently, the captain of the launch took the foreigner's underwear left behind and reported to the police ashore. The police found a passport in the underwear, revealing the foreigner's name as Lauter (transliteration), a German refugee registered at the Shanghai Refugee Shelter as number 2386. His residence was located at 1376 Avenue Joffre. Furthermore, a business card from a Mr. Medison, residing at 1132 East Broadway Road, was also found in the clothing. The Public Concession police authorities, knowing that this person resided in the French Concession, transferred the case to the French police for investigation. The French police immediately sent detectives to Mr. Medison at Broadway to inquire, who revealed that the person who drowned himself was his brother-in-law. According to the French police's investigation, Lauter, who drowned himself, was in the jewelry and diamond business. Lauter's wife stated that her husband often claimed to have a lot of money, but she had never seen his bank deposit slips. After this incident, various German and Russian jewelry stores in this port have been buzzing with rumors. Last night, many people reported to the French police that they had sold goods to Lauter on credit, with significant values. One Russian even lent him 600 US dollars. It was also reported that Lauter had purchased a Ford car for 450 US dollars two months ago.</p>

<h3>Science and National Liberation</h3>
<p>— Heshan</p>
<p>The Middle Ages in Europe were a dark period. At that time, tyrants, corrupt officials, warlords, and landlords ran rampant, preying on the people. The autocracy of religion was enough to make society lifeless and stagnant. Anyone who reads the history of medieval Europe knows that the people lived in dire straits, and their suffering was beyond human endurance. Since Copernicus emerged and discovered the system of celestial bodies, and Galileo followed, the physical phenomena of the universe have become increasingly clear. The thinking of the European people has undergone a great change. The superstition of religion and the power of monarchs were no longer able to bind them. Thus, the doctrines of freedom and equality arose, and the countries of Europe gradually moved towards reform. Therefore, the subsequent success of Rousseau, Montesquieu, and others in advocating revolution was actually based on the foundation laid by Copernicus and Galileo. When Newton, Darwin, and others emerged in response to the times, deeply pondered and researched, and wrote books for the world, almost all the people in the world were influenced by them. As the sciences of quality, force, number, etc., have become clear, the cause of utilizing resources and benefiting the people has also been promoted. The theory of natural selection and the survival of the fittest has especially penetrated into people's hearts, making the true outlook on life struggle daily on the path of evolution and dare not slacken. Therefore, those who observe the national situation often say that the rise and fall of a country can be determined by the efforts of scientists in that country. France was greatly aided by Pasteur's efforts in research. In the middle of the 19th century, Britain completely reformed the old system of medieval education, making the whole country scientific. Huxley's advocacy of scientific education was the first merit. Germany and Soviet Russia, after the fragmentation of the country, rose vigorously in a relatively short period. Their power is enough to influence the world. Numerous experts in the country have exerted their utmost efforts to save the country with science. Therefore, if a nation wants to survive in the world for a long time, flourish and grow, and not be conquered by other nations, it must rely on its people to work hard in science. Today, when our country is in this critical moment of survival, if we want to resist strong enemies, preserve national sovereignty, and become a permanently independent nation, we rely on those who are determined and patriotic to devote their efforts to the development of science.</p>
<h3>Metals and Plants</h3>
<p>— Xinshan</p>
<p>More than 150 years ago, people in Europe and America began to pay attention to the metals existing in the soil in order to understand how plants grow. In fact, not only does the soil contain many metals, but the plants themselves and their fruits also contain trace amounts of metals. However, these metals cannot exist independently and can only become various compounds with other elements, such as oxides, sulfates, phosphates, etc. Moreover, plants can only utilize metal compounds dissolved in water to achieve metabolic functions.</p>
<p>In the past, everyone thought that plants only need ten elements, namely carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and iron, from germination to maturity. After further precise research, it was discovered that at least eight other elements, namely manganese, copper, zinc, boron, barium, iodine, and arsenic, are needed to help plant growth in appropriate trace amounts. However, if the amount is excessive, it will be harmful to plants or even cause them to wither and die.</p>
<p>For example, if you analyze the ash obtained by burning a shellac tree sap, you will know that the ash actually contains 2.5% manganese. If a solution containing one part per 100,000 of manganese sulfate is used as a fertilizer for barley, the barley seedlings will grow particularly lush. If the manganese liquid is partially sprinkled on the shells of plant seeds, the embryos will grow particularly plump. Furthermore, if plants such as rice, wheat, oats, soybeans, peas, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, spinach, and lettuce are cultivated entirely with soil and fertilizers that do not contain manganese, the branches and leaves will inevitably be withered and lifeless. From this, we can believe that the chlorophyll in plant leaves, as well as the outer shells and inner embryos of plant seeds, cannot do without an appropriate amount of manganese.</p>
<p>Copper, arsenic, and zinc also significantly help plant growth: For example, spraying copper liquid on the branches and leaves of sweet potatoes can kill pests and increase the quality of sweet potatoes. Arsenic can increase the activity of ammonifying, nitrifying, and oxidizing bacteria, making the land fully utilized. Calcium arsenate, etc., can also be used to poison weevils and leaf-eating insects. Furthermore, although various zinc compounds are toxic, some can accelerate nitrification and greatly increase crop yields.</p>
<p>Many people are continuing to conduct research. The scope of research can be divided into three categories: analysis of soil and plants, scientific management of plant growth, and prevention and treatment of plant diseases. If there are amazing achievements in the future, they will greatly benefit mankind. Because in this way, we can improve the quality of plants and increase their yield in agriculture and horticulture, and vegetables, fruits, rice, wheat, etc., can be obtained at low prices. At the same time, in engineering and industry, we can accelerate the growth of wood, increase the supply of raw materials, and open up a new source of fuel.</p>
<p>Scientific Strange Tales</p>
<h3>Ghost Voice</h3>
<p>— Jiqian</p>
<p>Years ago, I lived in Nanjing. As the end of the year approached, my family was busy preparing for the New Year. One night, we went to bed later than usual. Suddenly, I faintly heard groaning sounds in the guest room, which were very miserable. However, when I paid attention to listen, I could not hear them anymore. And if I relaxed my attention a little, the sound would come again. My family was afraid, suspecting it was a ghost. I knew it was not true, but I didn't know where it came from, so I held a flashlight and searched everywhere in the room, checking all the desks, tables, and beds. Then, I tried my best to explore the courtyard and behind the house, but there was no trace. I also suspected that there might be a beggar lying sick outside the wall. I went out to look for it everywhere, but there was still no sign. When the method of observation was exhausted, this confusion could not be solved. Some suspected that there might be an ancient tomb underground, and the ghost sound came from it. However, digging the ground and springs was not easy, and it was already late at night, so I had to go to bed. I decided to wipe the table in the morning. When I accidentally pulled its drawer, I suddenly heard the sound again. Upon closer inspection, the old cat raised in the house was lying in the table cavity. The ghost sound last night was made by it. This drawer was carried and played by the child, and the cat was hiding in the table. Since the cat was old and sick, it was imprisoned and could not get out, so it made a distressed sound. Are all the strange phenomena in the world, if we fail to find out the truth, and then suspect them to be ghosts, all of this kind?</p>
<h3>"Cupping" Treats Severe Colds</h3>
<p>— Peisheng</p>
<p>Chinese folk methods use fire cupping on the forehead, which is said to treat headaches. Use a small porcelain can, burn a strip of paper into it, and when the fire has not completely gone out, immediately press the mouth of the can on the forehead, wait a while, and it will be sucked on. This is because the air in the can is driven out by the heat, the pressure is reduced, so the atmospheric pressure outside the can presses the can on the forehead and the can does not fall off. Also, because the blood pressure pushes the skin on the forehead into the can, so when the can is removed, a red circle appears on the forehead, because the blood is flowing.</p>
<p>This method is now adopted by Turkish baths to treat severe colds, with the aim of increasing blood circulation. This method sucks many small glass jars on the patient's back, as shown in the figure. First, heat the can on an alcohol lamp to reduce the air pressure in the can, and then combine them one by one on the back. The absorption effect sucks the blood to the epidermis. After the can is removed, there are red marks. According to the use of this method, there is absolutely no pain.</p>

<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>— Moxie</p>
<p>What shops rely on is signs, and what individuals rely on, besides appearances, are titles. Signs are valued for being old, and titles are naturally valued for being grand. As long as the title is grand, you don't need any real skills to scare people, just as a shop only needs an old sign, no matter what you sell or how you sell it, others can believe that your goods are genuine and fairly priced. This has almost become a common practice, and there is no need for me to say more.</p>
<p>However, as far as I know, just as signs are sometimes valued for being new, titles are sometimes valued for being long or wide in addition to being grand… In order to comply with the scientific spirit and no longer talk nonsense, I have extracted evidence as follows:</p>
<p>Obituaries or funeral signs often have such formats: "...B.A. from ×× University, graduate of ×× Middle School, graduate of ×× Elementary School." On top of this kind of detailed academic history, there are naturally also detailed official histories, which can even range from "Grand Preceptor to the Crown Prince" to "×× Patrol Inspector." The higher the rank, the more it is placed at the front; and the higher ranks are all later events, so it forms a real "later comes first" situation. This is what titles are valued for being long.</p>
<p>We can also often see business cards with many titles arranged around his name, for example: "President of ×× Society, Liaison Officer of ×× Company, Secretary of ×× Association, Director of Academic Affairs of ×× Elementary School, Manager of ×× Industrial Company, Editor of ×× Bookstore, Receptionist of ×× Shopping Mall…" This is really "wide"! Because they are arranged side by side, it has to be "wide"!</p>
<p>However, long or wide titles are not easy for everyone to have. Those who are enthusiastic about titles, or those who have something to gain from titles, still have to think of other ways. What are the other ways? Borrow!</p>
<p>It is said that there was once a distant relative of a prime minister who was traveling in Suzhou and wrote everywhere on the walls: "××, second cousin of the Grand Prime Minister, once traveled here." A humorous man named Li Zhang wrote next to him, saying: "Li Zhang, a 37th generation descendant of the Primordial Emperor, followed." This can be said to be good at borrowing. Similarly, "The funeral of Grandma Wang, the owner of the tofu shop opposite Wang Wenshao, a Grand Scholar of Wenhua Hall, a Co-managing Grand Scholar, Minister of the Ministry of Revenue..." Using a long string of Wang Wenshao's official titles can be said to be making the most of them. As for the past practice of borrowing the title plaques of relatives and old friends in weddings and funerals, arranging them in front to show off, it seems that this custom has not completely disappeared to this day.</p>
<p>But "if you borrow something for a long time and don't return it, how do you know it's not yours?" After all, borrowed things are not your own, and you always feel a little uncomfortable psychologically. Therefore, those who are enthusiastic about titles, or those who have something to gain from titles, have come up with a way to buy them.</p>
<p>In the past, as long as you were willing to study hard and had real talent and learning, you could pass the exams to become a xiucai, juren, jinshi, or Hanlin, no matter who you were. Now, however, it is not the case. A child has to spend hundreds of yuan in tuition fees to obtain the title of elementary school graduate, and this child's hard work and talent have little to do with it. By analogy, from elementary school graduate to university graduate and calling oneself a scholar, is not different, and the money spent increases later and later. As for studying abroad and returning with a foreign degree, that is entirely the power of money. Wouldn't I be exaggerating too much if I said that these scholar titles were bought? Moreover, throughout history, there have been examples of donating to get titles; donation also involves paying money, which is no different from buying. Therefore, what I said about buying is actually just the meaning of donating.</p>
<p>However, long or wide titles are always better if they are grander, and the borrowing or buying of them is of course to seek grander titles. Therefore, valuing titles for being grand is still an unbreakable truth. Some people, in order to have grand titles, do not hesitate to create them in addition to the above methods, which is even less surprising:</p>
<p>Doctors are called doctors, the owner of a cigarette paper shop is called the manager of a department store; insurance company runners are also managers; the "cadet pump operators" of gasoline company branches are also managers; the owner of a barbershop is a manager; the back-scrubbing elder in the bathroom is the director; the owner of a chicken and duck shop is the president…</p>
<p>Why does everyone like titles? Originally, titles, like appearances, have various advantages, so it is no wonder that everyone wants to obtain them. Moreover, appearances are for people to see, while titles are for people to hear. Those who see are few and those who hear are many, those who see are near and those who hear are far, so appearances are naturally not as good as titles. If a person has a grand title during his lifetime, once it is publicized, he can seize the initiative and make people respect, fear, and cherish him. After his death, he can be included in history books in a grand manner, or in genealogy books in a smaller manner, leaving a lasting reputation for generations. If it is said that the advantages of signs are profitable, then the advantages of titles are purely for fame. It is common for fame to lead to fortune, so there is nothing better. In one's life, who is not for fame and fortune!</p>
<p>Even emperors like certain titles, which shows how deeply titles penetrate people. For example, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang called himself "Li Daolong, a tribute student from the countryside," Emperor Huizong of Song called himself "Moral True Lord," and Emperor Wuzong of Ming called himself "General of Divine Might." Therefore, I also like titles very much. But I have no background. There is no place to borrow here, I have no money to buy, and I don't know how to create them, so I have to give myself the title "common people" of the Republic of China to amuse myself.</p>
<h3>No Border Defenses Between the U.S. and Canada</h3>
<p>— Bering</p>
<p>—— A Model of International Amity</p>
<p>At a time when the public is focused on the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line, suddenly discovering a border stretching over three thousand miles with absolutely no fortresses or artillery positions is truly inspiring. This is the border between the United States and Canada, a monument to the common sense of two great democratic nations.</p>
<p>This border begins east at New Brunswick, proceeds along a portion of the St. Lawrence River, and, with the exception of Lake Michigan, passes through all of the Great Lakes. It traverses the Great Plains, crosses the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, and extends west to Vancouver. In many of the more remote areas, there isn't even a single strand of wire to mark the end of Canadian territory and the beginning of American land.</p>
<p>Although this great border is not defended by military means, it is constantly patrolled, though the number of patrolmen, at just over three thousand, seems small. Patrols are necessary to prevent smuggling and illegal entry. Neither the United States nor Canada wants the other's "undesirable elements" entering their country, but as long as proper identification is presented and there are no suspicious signs, people can cross the border from the United States or Canada to the other side without difficulty. In some places, thousands of people cross the border every day to go to work. The authorities provide them with long-term passes, and the workers simply show their passes, just like someone with a monthly pass at a train station. In Detroit, thousands of Canadians who work in American automobile factories cross the border by ferry.</p>
<p>During the Great Depression, many people tried to cross the border illegally from one side to the other. At that time, both Canadians and Americans believed that "the other side" offered better opportunities for development than their own country. As a result, patrolmen employed special interrogation techniques, rarely failing to detect illegal immigrants. For example, if a Canadian claimed to be an American, the patrolman would ask him the name of his city's mayor or similar questions. He might even suddenly ask, "Where did you buy the clothes you're wearing?" If the answer was New York, the patrolman would turn up the person's collar to look at the label and see the name of the clothing store. If it was a Canadian clothing store, the patrolman would send the person back.</p>
<p>One place where people often tried to cross the border was the famous Peace Bridge over the Niagara River. There, people would often claim to be Americans returning to their country and would be allowed to proceed to the Canadian end of the bridge. However, when they reached the American authorities on the other end, they would be denied entry. These people were naturally not allowed to return to Canada immediately and were forced to remain on the bridge. On one occasion, such people stayed on the bridge for several days, unable to go forward or backward, with friends bringing them food. Finally, the two authorities suddenly came up with the idea of flipping a coin to decide the nationality of those whose ancestry could not be determined. For example, the Canadian side said, "If it lands heads, the person is ours; if it lands tails, the person is yours," and they decided the person's nationality in this way.</p>
<p>Tourists traveling by train or car do not encounter such frustrating procedures. Customs officials are adept at quickly inspecting cars, simply having the car drive over a mirror to check that no luggage is strapped to the underside. The inspection procedures on trains are also very convenient. Those traveling by train from New York to Chicago via Niagara are allowed to proceed with ease. In fact, most of these trains stop at convenient locations for inspection, and passengers have about a quarter of an hour to admire the local waterfalls.</p>
<p>In some parts of the West, there are ranches that straddle the border, and people can cross the border a dozen or twenty times a day. In the Rockies and the Sierra, there are deep canyons that are impassable to pedestrians, serving as natural barriers. There are also solitary high mountains on the border that have never been trodden by mountaineers, let alone patrolmen.</p>
<p>It has often been suggested that Canada should unite with the United States. For example, two years ago, someone in the United States introduced a resolution to the House of Representatives to that effect. However, the two countries live together so harmoniously, with so little friction, that such suggestions arouse little interest on either side. (Translated from the New York Evening Express)</p>
<h3>Shanxi's Eldest Brother Watches</h3>
<h3>Still Optimistic</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Pessimism only spoils things; it doesn't accomplish anything. Optimism is better because it can stimulate the spirit, increase courage, and generate intelligence and physical strength, far surpassing pessimism, which corrodes the heart, discourages people, causes them to retreat, and renders them useless.</p>
<p>In calm seas, one should certainly be optimistic and not engage in morbid moaning or unwarranted pessimism. However, in stormy and dangerous times, it is even more imperative to be optimistic and absolutely not pessimistic. Only optimism can save people from danger and help them reach their destination. Pessimism? It's simply out of the question!</p>
<p>We have always been optimistic, which makes me even more consistently optimistic. Now, some unexpected blows seem to be falling upon us, and I know that many people will inevitably lose their optimistic courage and fall into the trap of pessimism. I want to shout to them: Don't be pessimistic! Remain optimistic!</p>
<p>Under these small blows, pessimism is certainly useless. If we do not want to be slaves of a conquered nation, to be slaughtered by others, we must still strive and work hard to achieve our great goal of building a free and equal country. We can only regard these blows as insignificant, as inevitable setbacks in the process of life, no, of national construction, with optimism. We have our goals, our methods, our determination, our conviction. We are not afraid of any blows; we can overcome anything.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current blows cannot yet be considered blows. First, the impact is small, and second, the truth has not yet become clear. Furthermore, the current international situation is extremely complex. What is lost in the "east corner" can be gained in the "mulberry elm." As the saying goes, "If this place doesn't keep a man, there's always another place that will." I say, "If this place doesn't help a man, there's always another place that will." To put it more plainly: "If this person doesn't help me, there's always someone else who will." Looking at it from both sides, what reason do we have to be pessimistic? Pessimism is just worrying about something that might never happen!</p>
<p>Taking ten thousand steps back, even if we are ultimately going to fail, to perish, I would still like everyone to gloriously, worthily, with a smile, shed our last drop of blood! We will never be pessimistic!</p>
<p>However, as long as each of us is willing to shed our last drop of blood, we will never fail, we will never perish. I want everyone to stand tall, take a deep breath, and continue to struggle, continue to work hard!</p>
<p>Remain optimistic! Each of us must have such firm conviction in our hearts!</p>
<h3>Eavesdrippings</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Words and Deeds</p>
<p>There was such a time, perhaps in the era of Rudin, when words, beautiful words, held noble meaning. Eloquent oratory and astonishing rhetoric seemed to represent everything.</p>
<p>Action became insignificant; it was as if one did not need to consider deeds when speaking. As a result, one felt as if one were constantly surrounded by magnificent arguments, never lonely, but ultimately uncomfortable.</p>
<p>However, I say that in the face of facts, words are a superfluous existence—naturally, this is just a new way of stating an old saying.</p>
<p>This is the current era: the era of action. We demand something more practical. Let us have less empty talk and more of the power that each of us possesses! Everyone should use their hands to support this suffering nation, "Give one share of heat, emit one share of light." Even if it is meager, it is genuine.</p>

<h3>Finance: Wealthy Merchants Concentrate on the Gold Market, Speculation Actively Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for cash speculation in this city, although foreign exchange had stabilized, the gold rush was still actively developing. Although the daily fluctuations were not as large as in the previous days, it was still easy to rise and difficult to fall, with a difference of 170 yuan. It soared from 2,500 yuan to 3,670 yuan at closing. Continuing to rise another 140 yuan was actually due to the Tokyo Conference, which saw the British attitude soften and a compromise reached between Britain and Japan. Wealthy merchants in this city turned their buying interest away from foreign exchange and foreign currencies, focusing on collecting gold, leading to a sudden depletion of circulating funds. In the early morning, reports that President Chiang had made responsible statements regarding legal tender and foreign exchange greatly stabilized public sentiment, and foreign exchange was stable with a slight upward trend, which caused some selling. It once fell twice from the opening price of 3,530 yuan to the 3,500 yuan level. However, soon, money exchange businesses, certain jewelers, gold dealers, and stock market groups began to actively search for goods on behalf of pawnshops. In a situation of only buying and not selling, the upward trend suddenly became fierce, soaring close to the 3,600 yuan mark at noon. In the afternoon, it was heard that foreign exchange had turned from loose to tight, and buyers became even more aggressive, soaring to a high price of 3,670 yuan at closing. Public sentiment had changed from fatigue to firmness, and trading was slightly clear, with a total of about 2,000 taels in the morning and afternoon. Gold jewelry was once quoted at 5 yuan less, but ultimately 370 yuan, up 10 yuan. Chinese and English pure gold continued to fall, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Prices Are Easy to Rise and Difficult to Fall</p>
<p>Since the morning, the initial price per bar (ten taels) lacked change due to the relatively flat foreign exchange market. Initially, a certain cash shop released twenty taels to a gold shop, and a certain bank released thirty taels, with the price still at 3,530 yuan. Subsequently, upon hearing news of firmer foreign exchange rates, public sentiment became anxious and immediately fell by thirty yuan. A certain money exchange business sold fifty taels to a gold shop at a price of 3,500 yuan. Shortly after, a certain money exchange business immediately repurchased fifty taels from a certain bank at a price of 3,510 yuan. At this time, another money exchange business suddenly came to sell, heavily dumping downstream, selling fifty taels to a certain bank at 3,505 yuan. Subsequently, it crammed a total of fifty taels into a cash shop at a price of 3,500 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Although foreign exchange rates were reported to be loose at that time, a certain speculator from Hong Kong suddenly entrusted a certain money exchange business and a certain jewelry store to search for goods on their behalf, totaling more than 300 taels. In addition, the jewelry store group also bought more than they sold, and the upward trend suddenly began, soaring to ninety-five yuan. A gold shop released ten taels to a stock market group at a price of 3,595 yuan. The above were all supplied by another money exchange business and cash shops. Near noon, due to slightly weaker buying interest and another money exchange business continuing to sell, the situation slightly improved. Another money exchange business released ten taels to a stock market group at a price of 3,580 yuan. Later, the jewelry store group also released twenty taels to a certain broker at 3,570 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, a certain gold shop absorbed a considerable amount on behalf of speculators, and the opening price was five yuan higher. A certain gold shop took in fifty taels from a money exchange business at 3,575 yuan. After opening, hearing that foreign exchange rates had softened, sellers suddenly became scarce, and it immediately冲out beyond the 3,600 yuan mark. A certain gold shop took in thirty taels from a jewelry store group at 3,605 yuan. After this, stock market groups also came to track and search for goods, and the market situation became even firmer, soaring sixty-five yuan. Money exchange businesses mutually traded fifty taels at 3,670 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening. As a result, it rose sharply by 140 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of 170 yuan throughout the day. The quoted price of cash shops was 10 yuan higher. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were a few transactions.</p>
<p>Quoted Gold Rises Another Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The兑出price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores initially remained unchanged. At 9:50 AM, because speculation had slightly weakened, it was also quoted at five yuan less. Later, at 11:36 AM, it returned to five yuan higher. At 2:13 PM in the afternoon, it was quoted five yuan higher, and at 3:50 PM, it was quoted another five yuan higher. As a result, it was quoted ten yuan higher. It is estimated that major firms changed to 370 yuan, while new firms were at 368 yuan. However, there was no fixed price for the purchase counter.</p>
<p>Pure Gold at a Small Halfpenny</p>
<p>London, 24th – English pure gold continued to fall by a small halfpenny per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Bank of China's cash buying price also continued to fall to 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold also continued to fall by 4 jiao, estimated to be 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Gold Pounds Continue to Rise, Australian Gold Notes Also Rise Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies fell in the morning due to loosening foreign exchange rates. In the afternoon, the exchange market softened, speculation激涨, and the market was very firm and rising. In reality, foreign currencies were scarce, and the supply was not smooth. English and American gold pounds and gold notes rose sharply. Japanese gold notes also rose with the market.

<h3>Sassoon Actively Closes Forward Positions, The Foreign Exchange Market Suddenly Turns Tight, Swap Interest Rates Reach More Than Nine Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the exchange rates listed remained unchanged. Although the dark market for English and American exchanges considered the news of a compromise between Britain and Japan, President Chiang's responsible statement regarding legal tender and foreign exchange initially calmed public sentiment. The chaotic situation was extinguished, and the situation stabilized. In addition, Hong Kong telegraphs were抛塞before, and Sassoon and the Bombay Banking Corporation followed with sales. Therefore, the market situation had a slight softness. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that Japan would make further demands on England, so speculators became active. In addition, Western merchant Sassoon also aggressively absorbed in the futures market. As a result, the situation suddenly tightened, and the closing price was finally 4.5 jiao for English gold and 8.8125 yuan for American exchange. There were some swap transactions in the middle. It was heard that a certain bank塞出 cash and 套进 August, estimating that it paid Shanghai Textile Factory's American dollars 875, with a monthly interest rate of about 9.13%. Conversely, it would not be possible to贴出 a monthly interest rate of less than 1 jiao and 1 fen. Overall trading was still strong. There were few transactions for the Hong Kong exchange. The selling price was about 31 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<p>The Morning Market Was Quite Stable</p>
<p>In the early morning, the recent London big bar回縮0.0625, the forward price remained flat, New York silver prices remained stable, London raw gold continued to be a small halfpenny, the exchange rate of English to American was unmoved, to Shanghai fell 1.875, to France did not change, American to English unmoved, to Shanghai a big triangle, to France grew 0.0625. The central listed exchanges remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 4.5 jiao 53125 for English gold and 8.8125 yuan for American exchange. Compared to the previous closing, English was slightly tighter by 0.03125 and American was slightly looser by 0.0625. After opening, Hong Kong Telegraph first 塞予 foreign firms such as HSBC spot English gold 4.5 jiao 5625 and spot American exchange 8.875, making the situation quite stable. When the exchange listing was announced, it remained unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced to still be exempt. After this, Western merchant Sassoon suddenly came to sell, and the Bombay Banking Corporation also came to供塞, so the market situation was stable with a slight firmness. It is estimated that Sassoon and the Bombay Banking Corporation successively sold spot English gold 4.5 jiao 5625 and 59375 and spot American exchange from 8.875 to 96875 to HSBC and other foreign banks and a certain American bank. It was heard that foreign firms and speculators also absorbed, mostly American exchange. Later, the English bank was able to absorb the American firm's August American exchange at 8.0625 yuan. At times, there were some swap transactions. It is estimated that a certain bank塞出 cash and 套进 August, estimating that it paid Shanghai Textile Factory's American dollars 875, with a monthly interest rate of 9.13%.

<p>August American Exchange Enters the 8 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Although the Japanese bank came to抛塞later, Western merchant Sassoon suddenly came to猛吸 futures, and foreign firms and speculators had a good appetite, so the market situation gradually returned to flat. It is estimated that the Japanese bank sold spot English gold 4.5 jiao 5625 and spot American exchange 8.875 to foreign firms.

Compared to the previous day's evening closing, both English and American exchanges were tighter by 0.0625.</p>
<h3>Cash Released, Discount Rates Rebound and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange draft discount rate has begun to rebound and fall. The price per thousand yuan lowered from 240 yuan in the morning to about 230 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, cash continued to be released, further lowering to 220 yuan (the exchange draw for cash is still at a 70-80% discount), a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 1 jiao and 6 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Have Shown a Turnaround</h3>
<p>The dark market for securities slightly rebounded yesterday. After the trend of bank withdrawals expanded, the financial community was forced to sell off its old foreign exchange and gold reserves to obtain legal tender for adjustment. Banks, in turn, profited from this. Previously, the only tool for adjusting finance was public bonds. At this time, selling public bonds only yielded exchange drafts, and at a very low price, requiring a very large discount to obtain legal tender. As a result, foreign exchange and gold were able to achieve a small康, and the pressure on public bonds could also be reduced. Yesterday, due to President Chiang's statement, public sentiment was stabilized, and market prices rose by about 1 yuan. It was heard that it rose another 1 yuan or so after closing. These were relative transactions between individuals, so the difference could not be logically explained. Buyers in the market were the 14th and 16th, and also Yongfeng, Daqing, and Renchang. The sellers were Lianhe, Hengfu, Defu, and the 11th, and Maochun sold a considerable amount on behalf of Le Mao. Therefore, the market was still volatile. The future still has多头出脱, so there may still be twists and turns. As a result, the market price improved by 7 jiao to 1 yuan and 3 jiao, with a trading volume of about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A　51.60　50.80　51.60　Up 1.20</p>
<p>Unified B　43.40　45.00　43.30　Up 1.20</p>
<p>Unified C　42.50　41.50　42.00　Up 0.85</p>
<p>Unified D　41.10　41.00　41.10　Up 0.90</p>
<p>Unified E　1.80　41.50　41.55　Up 0.70</p>
<p>The listed prices of London's Chinese foreign debt on the 24th of this month (Monday) slightly increased. The English-German continued loan and the English-issued debt note rose by 2 pounds, with a price of 40 pounds. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway's original continued issuance of loans rose by 1 pound each, with a price of 12 pounds. The Beining Railway loan rebounded by 5 pounds, with a price of 45 pounds.

The Kailuan Mining shares fell by 9 pence, with a price of 16 shillings and 9 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Small Cloth Factories Close One After Another, It Is Difficult to Expect a Revival in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly softening. In fact, prices have entered a high realm, and digestion only relies on the south of Jiangsu. Apart from this, there is little hope for development. Investigating the reasons, one half says that financial tightening and the tightening of bank funds are increasing daily. The other reason is that funds from the interior are strictly prohibited and not allowed to be remitted to the occupied areas. From this point of view, there is no hope for loosening funds in the future. The other half is that the sales of cloth are narrow. Weaving the yarn into cloth not only does not generate profits but also incurs losses. Therefore, the sound of cloth factories closing their doors and stopping work is rampant.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, the market atmosphere was scattered in the early morning, and everyone was generally bearish and held a搶帽子principle. As for the brokers shouting to sell, the opening price fell by 10 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse was 545 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 532 yuan. Although there was some做作among them, shortly after, it was heard that the opening of foreign exchange had stabilized, and浮言 disappeared. Buyers also increased, and market prices slowly rose. In an instant, the warehouse price of 20-count Double Horse foreign yarn was 552 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price also reached 541 yuan. There were no major changes along the way. According to the statistics of half-day transactions, 825 bales were traded. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 4 yuan compared to the previous day, Five Sons fell by 10 yuan, and coarse yarn fell by 45 yuan. Only 20-count Shepherd rose by 2 yuan, due to its lower base. The factory opened 10 bales of 10-count Special Jincheng from the Yong'an Factory at a price of 598 yuan. Today, there were 90 pieces of cotton yarn transported to Hong Kong and 95 pieces transported to Xiamen. The amount purchased by each group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 395　Yunnan 10　Inland 20</p>
<p>Industry 400　Total 825　Previous Day's Transactions 140</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is still depressed and sluggish. Because of the lack of banknotes and cash flow, and because small cloth factories have closed down completely, there are few outlets for the yarn. Therefore, the selling price of現紗is still in a stagnant state. However, most are extremely bullish on next month, and prices are surprisingly high. In addition to asking for twenty yuan higher than the current price, the current asking price for 20-count Yueqin yarn is 410 yuan, and the price for next month is estimated to be 431 yuan.</p>
<h3>Factories Are Canceling Forward Contracts for Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton trade has seen some transactions, but factory appetite hasn't expanded significantly due to tight credit. The market situation remains unchanged. As for foreign cotton, factories are increasingly abandoning previously ordered forward contracts. This is due to the drastic shrinkage of exchange rates and the shortage of legal tender funds, to avoid future difficulties when the goods arrive in Shanghai. The supply from Northern Jiangsu continues uninterrupted, with 289 bales of Tongzhou cotton recorded. The current cotton conditions are listed below:</p>
<p>Changyinsha packed cotton: 113.00</p>
<p>"Fire Engine" cotton: 85.000</p>
<p>"White Rock" cotton: 101.00</p>
<p>The "Duck" shipping vessel, "Shetland," managed by the Great Britain Company, arrived from Calcutta this morning at 9:00 AM, carrying 1,300 pieces of cotton. It docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is rumored that a large quantity of Indian cotton is also expected to arrive in Shanghai this month.</p>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai, the announcement of US cotton export subsidies yesterday translates to a reduction of 23-24 yuan per picul in legal tender terms. However, due to unresolved exchange rate and financial issues, only previously purchased cotton can be settled with foreign firms. Although this yields a profit of over ten yuan per picul, the future shortage of raw materials leaves only the option of reducing production to cope with these difficulties.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was excited due to the weekend's government export subsidy report. The opening saw a jump of over ten points. Later, booming spot transactions in the South and adverse weather reports from cotton-growing areas triggered purchases by new accounts. By the close, due to profit-taking by bullish investors, the market still ended up ten points higher than the previous day's prices. The Indian cotton market was affected by the US cotton export subsidy, with yesterday's prices and predictions falling nearly two rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by over ten points.</p>
<p>Defeng Factory imported 20 pieces, transferred by draft to the factory.</p>
<p>Fellow traders imported 85 bales, delivered through the currency exchange.</p>
<p>Also, 10 pieces. In addition, several hundred pieces of fine twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth were imported. Dyeing factories imported over one hundred bales of satin gray and twill gray fabrics. Sales of these fabrics are better in Southeast Asia. There were transactions for 3,000 bolts of colored cloth and bleached twill. Sales offers from factories have mostly switched to current yarn prices, causing significant fluctuations. In the past, orders were placed at fixed exchange rates, with factories relying on a premium of 50-60 yuan at the time to purchase raw materials. Recently, the premium has unexpectedly surged, leading to substantial losses. Yesterday, the Dyeing and Weaving Factories Association discussed demanding that customers discount to 95% for cash payments, but customers insisted on the original agreement and refused to concede. Disputes are escalating.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for fine cloth and fine twill remained stable. The spot price for "Dragon Head" fine cloth remained at 14.3 yuan per bolt, with a decrease of 0.1 yuan for next month, at 14.9 yuan. Sales to customers were minimal. Local merchants are holding 500-600 pieces of current and forward orders for fine cloth and fine twill, but traders are not opening sales. The market is quiet but firm.</p>
<p>Today, 115 pieces of finished cloth were exported to Xiamen and 60 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White and Coarse White Both Down Slightly</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, nearby August sugar was at 7 shillings 1.25 pence, up 0.25 pence. December remained unchanged. Next March saw a slight decrease of 0.5 pence, to 6 shillings 2.25 pence. The association's price: 24.4-24.5 yuan for coarse white. Our warehouse: 34 yuan. Other warehouses: 33.7 yuan. Transit goods: 25.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white fell similarly. B mark, Western warehouse: 36.5 yuan. Eastern warehouse: 36.3 yuan. Western warehouse CW mark: 36.3 yuan. CX mark: 36 yuan. DY mark: 35.4 yuan. HX mark: 35.2 yuan. H mark crude red: 22.5 yuan. Spot Dutch red: 27.5 yuan, unchanged. Transit goods fell slightly, from 20.8 to 20.6 yuan. Our factory's crystal small: 0.5 yuan. Grade 1 crystal: 37.5 yuan. Jingming crystal: 39 yuan. National sugar: Guangbang offered 300+ bags of Huizhou white, priced at 36.75 to 36.3 yuan, settled at 32 yuan. Over twenty bags of Hainan ocean sugar at 29.2 yuan. Youtoubang offered over one hundred bags of sliced cyan sugar at 16.5 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 25th, 32 cases of sugar slices arrived from Hong Kong, and 1,780 bags of sugar arrived from Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Finished Cloth: Discount Rates Rising Daily; Factories Demand 95% Cash, Customers Insist on Original Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was quiet. Tight credit conditions significantly restricted spot sales and hoarding activities. Weihaiwei traders offered over one hundred bales of 16-pound Double Elephant and Kui brand coarse cloth. Guangdong traders offered 50-60 cases of colored cloth, colored twill, and serge, as well as thirty-plus bales of 16-pound and 14-pound Earth brand coarse cloth. Local hoarders...</p>
<h3>Grains: Customer Sales Unabated, Flour Market Stable</h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market stabilized. Factory prices, after rising by 0.2 yuan over the weekend and the first two days of this week, have been considered high. Moreover, factory sales require cash payments, causing some issues for customers. Therefore, sales have not been particularly strong. Yesterday, traders from both northern and southern provinces maintained their sales appetite, with transactions of several thousand bags each in Tianjin, Weihai, Shantou, and Xiamen. However, large-scale disposals are not yet occurring. Currently, most factories have reduced production, and production is limited. Given the high prices and the increasing cost of foreign wheat, those holding goods are unwilling to compromise to sell them off. Hence, the market is fairly stable. Grade 2 flour stood at 4.85 yuan, unchanged. Transactions totaled over 30,000 bags, all jointly handled by local and northern/southern traders. Today, 28,200 bags of flour are being shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of new wheat continued uninterrupted. Most of the newly arrived goods were placed in warehouses for sale. Currently, flour mills are experiencing poor sales. Although some hoarders are interested, this is not a normal sales channel. Therefore, sellers are unwilling to compromise to sell off their goods. Yesterday, 1,200 bags of wheat from Suzhou, Kunshan, and Taicang were sold, priced at 6.7 to 6.8 yuan. The market was relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Where Will Rice Prices Rise To? Speculation Suggests 23 Yuan, Saigon Rice at 26 Yuan</h3>
<p>National Rice: Yesterday, due to price controls, prices could not rise further. Although there were rumors of private deals at 23 yuan, concerns persisted, leading to a lack of supply from merchants. The market was essentially stalled. Only South Port early and late rice was traded, at 20 yuan, but only thirty dan were sold. Wuhu polished rice was traded at 16 yuan, and Su hot rice at 15.4 yuan. Other varieties, such as thick japonica, Duyang pointed rice, and others, saw no market activity. Rice merchants are truly pushing millions of people to the brink, causing unrest and giving others a reason to worry about Shanghai's security. Total city transactions amounted to only 375 bags and 30 dan. However, sources from various routes arrived at South Port, including 12 early/late rice, and nearly 3,000 bags of Qigao, Chelnin, Baozi Laiqingjiao, and Fengjing goods.</p>
<p>Customer Rice: Yesterday, store hoarders maintained their appetite. Traders from inland provinces and rural areas also inquired. As the price of polished glutinous rice was low, customer traders competed to purchase it, driving up the price by 0.5-0.6 yuan. Glutinous rice also rose to the 16 yuan limit. Polished glutinous rice was only directly allocated to customers, with no formal market trading. Customer traders moved over 1,000 bags, and local merchants moved 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Sellers insisted on higher prices. New Saigon rice was unwilling to sell easily, with prices called at 26 yuan. Buyers found the price too high and no agreement was reached. However, old Saigon high-quality rice, previously approved by the Public Works Department, also reached 25 yuan. Total city transactions amounted to over one hundred bags.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Steadily Rising, Sales Volume Declining</h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market has been steadily rising. However, sales volume has inevitably declined. Export activity has been lively, but mostly handled by foreign merchants for transit. Yesterday, only local traders inquired about the market, with a total of three cars of Dalian Sipingjie soybeans traded, with prices frequently rising from 10.096 yuan to 11.2 yuan. Also, 176 bags of Bengbu soybeans at 9.5 yuan, 160 bags of Wuhu soybeans at 10.07 yuan, and 100 bags of Hankou first-crop soybeans at 10.02 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 26th, 210 bags of soybeans and 10 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Rises by 25 Yuan, Still Insufficient to Meet Demand</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli has been out of stock for a long time. It is rumored that over four hundred pieces have arrived, but most are for transit. Therefore, only about one hundred pieces were offered for sale, resulting in extremely high demand and prices. Previously sold for 70 yuan, it now reaches 95 yuan, a sudden increase of 25 yuan, which is still insufficient to meet demand.</p>
<h3>Coal: Slack Coal Sells Briskly in Under-the-Table Deals</h3>
<p>The slack coal business is typically slow during this time of year, but due to the sudden shrinkage of exchange rates, demand has surged. However, the supply from producing areas is limited. Although there are several thousand tons in stock in Shanghai, they are controlled by a certain foreign firm, leading to a perceived shortage in the market. Under-the-table prices have risen repeatedly. Grade 1 Kailuan slack costs 44 yuan per ton, and Grade 2 costs 36 yuan. Traders are conducting cash transactions, selling from warehouses, with local merchants adding a 4 yuan commission.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Black Moss Stocks Dwindling</h3>
<p>The previous stock of black moss has gradually dwindled due to continuous sales. There have been no new arrivals recently, so lion's mane moss is out of stock, and prices are firm. Xilan and Longya moss are both selling at a cash price of 29 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Galvanized Wire Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>The new galvanized wire market has been active recently. Local factories are aggressively purchasing it, and hoarders are also buying in large quantities. Yesterday's transactions totaled an estimated 500-600 dan. Prices are rising due to limited spot availability and high costs. Grades 21 to 25 sell for 60 yuan, while Grade 25 single-strand fancy wire requires 80 yuan. Coarse fancy wire also requires around 40 yuan. Mid-range goods are priced below 40 yuan. Due to low inventories and high demand, the market is exceptionally brisk.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: "Shan Nai" Grade Goods Nearing Depletion</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Shantou, the source of "shan nai" has been cut off for a long time. Current inventories are limited to a few merchants. Recently, traders have shown strong interest, but sellers are unwilling to release their goods easily, leading to mutual hoarding. This may create unprecedented high prices.</p>
<p>Introduction of New Books</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Woolen Fabric Patterns: Dislike the Old, Love the New... Prolonged Use Means Outdated; Trendy Patterns... Mostly Renovated Old Styles</h3>
<p>The popularity of woolen fabrics and textiles has truly grown with each passing year. The changes in their patterns and the rise and fall of sales are too numerous to describe. Thinking about the buying, selling, and ordering aspects of this industry, I have gathered some real historical information to write about, and I offer it to all circles.</p>
<p>Around 1917-19, the woolen fabric business boomed like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Yellow-green tweed and printed tweed for overcoats sold very well, with strong buying power from traders in South and North China. Rongtai and Hanli were the most famous for tweed, while Heji's double-color brand was the oldest for printed tweed. Later, due to the outbreak of the European War, goods could not be delivered as scheduled, and the British exchange rate rose to 8-9 shillings. Some woolen fabric firms in Shanghai went bankrupt due to losses. After the storm passed, patterns and sales had already changed. At this time, five-color overcoat fabrics were popular, with the Haohua brand being the most prestigious, followed by Anli Luhuatang. Melton cloth was also very popular, with Deji Dulanxiang being the leading brand. Velvet fabrics such as black "qiang," yellow "qiang," silver "qiang," sable, leopard skin, long-haired, yellow-black otter velvet, large and small sea otter velvet, and double-sided yellow camel velvet were selling well. Double-sided yellow camel velvet was best known for Rongtai's "Recruiting a Son-in-Law" and Deji Foreign Firm's "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats" brands. The popularity of pearl velvet and cloud-patterned velvet was very strong. Northern traders favored these fabrics because the climate was colder than in the South, leading to the popularity of Chinese-style overcoats.</p>
<p>In 1927, the Northern Expedition unified China. Thick fabrics with large plaid and solid colors were popular, while thin fabrics with blended colors and plaid Walter tweed were popular. Felt fabrics were also popular, with strong demand from local customers for shoe uppers. At that time, Yuanzhigong cloth was known for Rongtai's 15330, Hefeng's 21127, and Deji's 1336, as well as Anli's Jubao Basin and Public Welfare Gold Pagoda brands, all of which were widely sold. As for colors, those suitable for Chinese clothing materials, blue-gray colors were most popular; foreign red and ash-gray mixed colors were also briefly popular, but sales were far less than blue. Later, dark green and snuff colors became popular, with snuff colors remaining popular for a longer period than other colors. At the same time, Chinese jacket materials were eliminated, and the sales of Chinese jacket fabric, snowflake fabric, and zhigong fabric declined sharply. Starting in 1929, newly arrived riding breeches fabric became very popular. (Riding breeches fabric had already been sold to piece goods traders in earlier years. It was originally intended for making riding breeches, hence the name riding breeches fabric. Now, local traders have innovated and promoted it as a material for lined overcoats.) Chinese overcoats all rushed to use it, because it was durable and suitable for spring, autumn, and winter, resulting in a sharp decline in the sales of thick overcoat fabrics. At that time, domestic wide and narrow camel velvet was launched, with Wei Yi and Wei Lun being the first. As a result, velvet fabrics such as "qiang," otter, sea otter, and leopard skin fabrics gradually fell behind and disappeared. Polish plain thick cloth suddenly became popular, due to the need for military uniforms. Yellow serge also saw increased sales. The changes in woolen fabric patterns at this time also included iridescent Walter tweed, herringbone small plaid serge, patterned gray serge, small hat patterned fabric, and plaid mottled fabric, which were also very popular. Those that fell behind and became unsalable were miscellaneous serge, pearl tweed, plaid Walter tweed, and plaid overcoat fabric.</p>
<p>After 1931, women's colored overcoats became popular, leading to a surge in the sales of women's miscellaneous-colored overcoat fabrics. Chinese clothing materials, regardless of color or pattern, saw few changes. However, cheap inferior goods also flooded the market, and customers bought them because of their low prices, causing the sales of Western mainline serge and robe fabric patterns to decline. Another difference was that domestic yarn-hair backing cloth was refined, with increased production and lower prices than imported goods, which customers welcomed, and the market was completely taken back by domestic products. (Imports have been seen to disappear in recent years.) Horsehair sleeve lining and feather yarn, as well as black charcoal lining, also saw a sharp decline in sales. Because silk-gloss feather yarn was invented, it was extremely popular. Horsehair sleeve lining also had domestic products available, and black charcoal lining could be replaced by Ningbo Jiangshan horse tail lining, resulting in a 50% decrease in imports. After the January 28th Incident, wearing Western suits became like a rising tide. The opening of Western-style clothing stores in this port city increased continuously every year. The patterns of Western suit fabrics changed, including new Hanlimeng, Palisi, Fan'erding, herringbone woolen fabric, white canvas, and Hailisi, etc. The colors changed fleetingly, including stripes, large plaid, medium plaid, small plaid, solid colors, herringbone, "ban si," and oblique patterns, and were not fixed. Because Western suit fabric patterns were unusually numerous, most were selected by customers.</p>
<p>In recent years, the trends in woolen fabrics have changed. In terms of colors, those that sell well include Chinese clothing materials' dark, common, gray, camel, and blended colors, and Western suit materials add a vegetable green color. In terms of patterns, stripes are the most popular, followed by small plaid. The rest depend on the proper mixing and weaving. Patterns that are not too bright, but generous and elegant, are best. For Walter tweed, blended colors are popular for robe fabrics, dark blue is popular for Western suit sets, yellow is popular in military circles, solid serge is popular in dark blue, and patterned fabrics, in addition to large plaid coarse patterns, are best when they are delicate and clear. The most fashionable women's overcoat fabrics are seahorse white and screw velvet, and Western suit fabrics with Western characters on the edges are popular. Riding breeches fabric and camel tweed are popular for lined overcoat fabrics. For Western suit overcoats, Houms four and Hailisi are popular in spring and autumn, and heavy gray solid hair cloth is popular in winter. Flannel feather yarn fabrics, fat leather 巴勒呢 , white serge, white zhigong, hemp glue cloth, and white canvas are popular in summer. Single-sided waterproof raincoats made of dark gray 开水米 are consistently popular.</p>
<p>International Financial Market</p>
<p>Financial issues are extremely complex. Since transportation is convenient and the market is widespread, the world is united as one. Therefore, a change in the financial situation of one country can have an impact on the entire world. There is undoubtedly some organization involved in this, and financial markets such as those in London, New York, and Paris hold the key, implicitly wielding control over the world's financial markets. Markets everywhere seem to listen to their commands. Since the major upheaval in international finance in 1931, countries such as Britain and the United States have successively abandoned the gold standard. Gold, which for decades had been the supreme and highest quality currency material, has lost much of its luster. The news spread, and other countries followed suit, creating the current situation. Today, if one does not understand the situation in the international financial market, they may be caught off guard by events, leading to unpredictable consequences. This book covers the causes and consequences of financial panics in various countries, the forced abandonment of the gold standard, and the organization and operation of major financial markets in London and New York. It thoroughly investigates the facts, providing detailed analysis, research, and accurate descriptions. The translator, Mr. Liu Kongjun (Fuzhong), has worked in the financial industry for many years and is very fond of research. He has translated the original book by John T. Madden and Marcus Nadler, professors at New York University in the United States. It details the functions and operations of the world's major financial markets, as well as the systems of major national banks and the international financial tasks of various markets. It can serve as an aid to those who aspire to research. The book is published by the Zhengzhong Bookstore on Sima Road.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Children's Hospital Established</h3>
<p>— (Yi Su)</p>
<p>Creating Welfare for Sick and Impoverished Children is a Great Virtue; We Hope All Sectors will Enthusiastically Donate for Free Beds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Hospital, founded by Shanghai elders, was established the day before yesterday (the 24th). Its address is a clean and quiet Western-style building with about twenty rooms, located at the intersection of Moore Road and Fuxu Road.</p>
<p>It was transformed from the Shanghai Refugee Children's Hospital and the Weihaiwei Road International Red Cross Infant Hospital. The reason for the merger, it is said, is that the number of refugees in Shanghai is gradually decreasing, and the authorities of the two hospitals believe that the two hospitals can be merged. They held a meeting in May and resolved to establish a new hospital, named the "Shanghai Children's Hospital." Its current address is the former Shanghai Refugee Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>A relative of mine, Miss Zhang, works there as a doctor. With her guidance and permission, I accompanied her on a tour. The top-class ward has one large bed and one small bed, with the large bed for the patient's parents to accompany them. The first-class room being toured did not have any children occupying it. Only a foreign girl doll was placed on the small bed. Near a table was a wooden model of the foreign house. There are five such rooms, each bed costing four yuan per day. The second-class room being toured has three large and small beds, occupied by sick children, and parents accompanying them. There are five such rooms, each costing two yuan. The third-class rooms have ten beds each, costing one yuan per person per day. I heard that this fee is not for profit, but only to cover expenses. The hospital has a total of one hundred beds, with eighty free beds. These free beds are donated by charitable organizations and enthusiastic individuals. Those who donate for a full year will have their names hung on the bed. For example, donors who donate in memory of Dr. Niu Huisheng will have "In Memory of Dr. Niu Huisheng" printed on the plaque in Roman characters.</p>
<p>Almost every ward is filled with sick children. The older ones are six or seven years old, the younger ones are one or two years old. There are also newborns.</p>
<p>When walking into a ward for lung diseases, I asked why those with infectious diseases were not isolated. Miss Zhang replied, "We don't admit infectious diseases here. These are mild lung diseases." She pointed to a sick child as an example, "This child's heart is on the right side..." Hearing these words, I felt relieved. Not all of these sick children are poor, because the granddaughter of the great scholar Tang Wenzhi is lying on a second-class bed.</p>
<p>The hospital pays attention to the diet of the sick children. Walking to the entrance of the kitchen, a smiling lady in charge said, "Welcome, please come in." The stoves use electricity. The utensils, such as bowls and cups, are very clean and tidy. Record sheets and recipes are hung on the wall.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang led me to the X-ray room and pointed, "This X-ray machine was originally prepared by Tongde Hospital, worth seven thousand yuan. Li Yunshan's family and friends contributed five thousand yuan to purchase it from Tongde and donate it to this hospital in memory of Mr. Li. Tongde lost two thousand yuan, meaning they made a donation." The operating room has not been completely decorated. The lights in the room shine like daytime, and the floor is covered with rubber. All major and minor operations are temporarily performed by consulting doctors, with surgical fees charged appropriately. Touring the outpatient clinic, I learned that consultations are held every afternoon from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Poor and sick children sent by shelters are treated and given free medicine. Other outpatient children are charged one corner, with medication priced at cost. Outside the textile supplies room, Miss Zhang said, "This area stores clothing and other items donated by the hospital's women's auxiliary..."</p>
<p>Currently, there are still many refugees in Shanghai. In this cold and hot weather, disease may inevitably befall them. If they are not treated, their lives may be lost. However, the Shanghai Children's Hospital has not filled its quota for free beds. We hope that enthusiastic people in society will donate generously to benefit those poor and sick children.</p>

<h3>Introducing a "Subsidy Method for Employees"</h3>
<p>— Small Employee</p>
<p>Recently, the soaring rice prices in Shanghai have greatly affected the general population, especially those on salaries. Therefore, banks and major stores are finding ways to subsidize their employees, but each has its own method, and the standards are inconsistent. Here, I would like to introduce a relatively reasonable subsidy method for everyone's reference.</p>
<p>This is a method used by a major bookstore to subsidize its employees:</p>
<p>(1) Take the highest rice price published daily in the newspaper as the standard. If the monthly average reaches 16 yuan in national currency, all employees will receive a subsidy of 1 yuan in national currency; if it reaches 17 yuan, a subsidy of 2 yuan; if it reaches 18 yuan, a subsidy of 3 yuan; and so on. Trainees receive half.</p>
<p>(2) If the rice price gradually falls, the subsidy will also gradually decrease. No subsidies will be given when the price returns to within 16 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) This method is limited to one year, from July of this year to June of next year.</p>
<p>The following points are worth noting in the above method:</p>
<p>(1) The original highest rice price set by the department was 14 yuan, which has been in effect for several years. Therefore, an increase of one yuan has a small impact and does not require a subsidy, but an increase of two yuan (i.e., to 16 yuan) is already felt, so the subsidy begins, which is very reasonable.</p>
<p>(2) Designating the highest rice price published daily in a certain newspaper as the standard, and using the monthly average rice price as the standard for subsidies, is very scientific. Moreover, increasing and decreasing subsidies according to the rice price indicates that this is a genuine subsidy and not a disguised salary increase, which can eliminate all kinds of unnecessary concerns.</p>
<p>(3) All employees are treated equally. Of course, the proportion of the subsidy is smaller for those with higher salaries, and the proportion is larger for those with lower salaries. (For example, if someone making 100 yuan receives a 5 yuan subsidy, it is only 5%; while someone making 20 yuan also receives a 5 yuan subsidy, it is 25%.) "The great have great difficulties, the small have small difficulties." High-level employees seem to be at a slight disadvantage here, but their daily lives are generally easier to maintain. Therefore, this is another method of particularly considerate to low-paid employees, especially since workers are treated the same, which is truly rare! As for trainees, because they are still young and have not yet started a family, halving the subsidy is also very fair.</p>
<p>(4) This method is limited to one year, which is also very reasonable. Because in these years, things change rapidly, and no one can predict the future, so a limited-term method seems to be more appropriate.</p>
<h3>Rain After the Storm</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Fireworks in Thousands of Homes, Rural Cooperation, Waves of Ten Thousand Li, Overseas Flight</p>
<p>Why say it's nonsense? Those who come to China for inspection are all experts. How can we dismiss it with a single stroke? However, regarding the so-called hundreds or thousands of years, we must see how the world uses coal in the future. Who knows, in a few decades, a revolution in world fuel may occur, not affecting these coals? Some scientists are trying to find ways in the sunlight, without having to dig out the black gold from the mines piece by piece! On the day of the year 2000 AD, we don't know what the scene will be! But at this moment, the coal in Shanxi can always be said to be inexhaustible and inexhaustible. The reason why the country wants to control it is because China's coal exports have been very high in recent years. As for rural areas, they still burn mountain firewood, thatch, and other natural fuels, which are left to the people's freedom and are not subject to control. Today, the two He family sisters came to the countryside for a tour and found it very interesting. They had never been to the countryside to play before, and this is a new village, they feel that the fun of the countryside is more interesting than the city. Zhu Ai'ren also bid farewell to his grandfather, mother, and the He sisters and returned to Anle Town. They rested for one night and will write to their father tomorrow, informing him in detail about accompanying Ai'ren to Freedom Village to visit Ai'ren's grandfather, Village Chief Wei, and going to inspect the factory site. They are discussing several things with their father: one is the construction of the house. Because the factory site has been decided in Freedom Village, they must prepare to build factory buildings. The land that Village Chief Zhu led them to see yesterday is a place with convenient land and water transportation. Although it is said that it can only be decided after being approved by the village council, this is not a problem. However, there are various differences in the design of the factory building. Each factory has its own style, and each factory has its own suitability. A machine factory cannot be built in the same way as a textile factory. Because these are all to place machines in the factory building, the factory building and the machine are very related. However, contemporary construction engineers have a clear plan in mind for those methods, and they are not wrong at all. Haven't the two He family sisters said long ago that if they build a factory building, there is a ready-made engineer here? Isn't that ready-made engineer Lin Jiancheng, the fiancé of Jin Danyu? After deciding on the address, they can make a decision and go with Lin Jiancheng to see it. Not only Lin Jiancheng, but also Jin Danyu. However, their wedding is near, don't disturb them because of this matter. (163)</p>
<h3>Directed "Deferred Debt Repayment"</h3>
<p>— Xia Xia</p>
<p>When I pick up the pen, I simply don't know what to write. Is it because there is nothing to write? No, on the contrary, it is precisely because there are so many thoughts in my heart that I don't know where to start?</p>
<p>Since Shanghai fell as an isolated island, many pioneers in the theater industry, those who are capable, have left one after another. Therefore, in this period of "Shu has no great generals, Liao Hua fills the vanguard," even a low-energy person like me has actually become a director. This is really as awkward and slippery as forcing a duck onto a shelf. I can't help but feel my heart beating, sweating, and ashamed when I think about it. But can I say that because of my incompetence, I should give up the opportunity to do my best and contribute a little effort to the suffering compatriots? No, no, a thousand noes, ten thousand noes, even if I am 120% incompetent, useless, even if the heart and effort I can contribute are as small as a sesame seed, it is always better than nothing, because even though sesame seeds are small, when gathered together, they are still useful, so I decided to do my best in this charity performance. I would rather shamelessly and immodestly agree to direct the play "Deferred Debt Repayment." I am willing to be embarrassed, make a fool of myself, be disgraced, suffer, and I am prepared to hear people scold me for not being qualified and too presumptuous. I am waiting to accept all bad criticism about the play, but I am not willing to give up this opportunity to do my best for the suffering compatriots.</p>
<p>Now is no longer the era of national prosperity and ruin, but every man is responsible. The country does not belong only to men, but to every citizen. Patriotism does not distinguish between men and women, young and old. What men can do, we women must also do, because we are the same people, we are the same citizens, and we are equally responsible to the country.</p>
<p>A wave of emotion rushed, and I couldn't stop myself. I don't know what else I would say if I continued to write. In order to maintain my consistent principle of "talk less, do more," let's stop for now. Fortunately, the day when I can happily and thoroughly say everything in my heart is not gone, so let's leave it for then.</p>
<p>Now I only hope that my friends who care about me can give me more strict guidance and criticism on this play "Deferred Debt Repayment" that I directed, because I need your guidance and encouragement to improve.</p>
<p>Finally, let me ask all the Chinese people in Shanghai for those suffering compatriots: "Dear compatriots! Come! Come to the Golden Theater to see the play! Because this play is not only for entertainment, but behind the entertainment there is a greater significance. Every Chinese citizen should come to the Golden Theater to see the play without hesitation! Come on! Everyone come quickly!"</p>

<h3>Lively Scene by the Sea</h3>
<p>Lord Jin, the magistrate of Nanhui County, has been in office for more than a year. He resigned from his official post last month and was transferred to Wujiang. A few days before his departure, the gentry all prepared farewell banquets. For days, they flew cups and sang drunk, almost like Zheng Station retaining guests. Those who sent plaques and those who sent tablets were endless on the way. When he set off, the carriages and horses filled the streets, and the voices of people were boiling. When the magistrate composed a farewell poem and boarded the carriage, banners and flags stood in rows along the way, flying in five colors, counting several pairs of plaques praising his virtuous administration, eight canopies of the people, and items such as clothing of the people. Among those who sent him off, there were those with white hair, those with white beards, those in yellow clothes, and those in red shoes, all holding incense and kneeling to see him off. The magistrate immediately got out of the carriage and leaned over to lift them up one by one, giving them reward silver. At this time, the viewers were like walls, and everyone had the desire to cling to the wheels and the feeling of lying on the tracks. However, there was one thing that spoiled the scenery, that is, a person carrying a grass basket filled with paper money for the dead, and also using several bundles of silk paper, burned it to the right of the South Gate, alas! These are probably people who have failed to exploit the people. On that day, various kinds of tricks emerged. Men and women crowded to the scene, almost more than two thousand people, and the seaside suddenly became a lively scene.</p>
<h3>Four Courtesans of Yan City</h3>
<p>There are many famous courtesans in Yan City, but not as many as in the past. However, there are four courtesans who all have nicknames. One has snow-white skin and a flower-like face and is called White Bread Cake; one is like a peony painted entirely in ink and is called Black Bread; one has a face like a full moon and is called Mantou Wu'er; and one has a pair of sharp jaws and is called One Nest Cake. A certain vice minister was intimate with all four beauties and hated One Nest Cake for being too self-important. Therefore, he wrote a bamboo branch poem to mock her, saying: "Don't boast that the white bread cake's face is heavily covered with silk gauze, she has had her neck fondled by the Mantou; after all, it is not as good as the black bread, the most boring is the two One Nest Cakes." When One Nest Cake heard this, she was furious and asked a hooligan to bring the vice minister to her, counting his faults to his face, and then they argued with each other. The vice minister had long harbored resentment, so he smashed all the objects in the house, the pearls were broken and the jade was shattered, the mirror was broken and the bottle was overturned. After people persuaded them to disperse, One Nest Cake sobbed all night and hanged herself on the bed, but fortunately, the madam woke her up, otherwise, she would have died a tragic death.</p>

<h3>Big Boss, Second Boss - A Tale of Rivalry in the Wilderness (2)</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>—Miscellaneous Memories of the Plum Blossoms—</p>
<p>Originally, their feelings were not harmonious, and there were many opportunities for conflict. Whenever it was triggered, just as they were about to fight, they were always persuaded to stop, unable to do what they wanted, and both felt regret in their hearts! Unspeakable disappointment!</p>
<p>One day, because of a small matter, the two quarreled again. Fortunately, there was no one else around, so the two decided to find a quiet and uninhabited place and have a good time, decide who was superior, so as to avoid being depressed all the time! After the two agreed, they clapped their hands to show their great faith. On that day, both were overjoyed, shook hands respectfully, and bid farewell.</p>
<p>The struggle of the strong men began the next day. After the performance that day, they walked out of the backstage together. As they walked, they discussed with each other: "Where shall we go today?" "How about Heilongtan in Nanxiawazi?" "Okay!" So the two walked towards Heilongtan.</p>
<p>Heilongtan: It is the most desolate place outside the South City, with lonely graves piled up and weeds stretching endlessly! There is no human habitation nearby, and it is a place rarely visited. Except for the corner of the battlements hidden far away in the "clump of decaying willows," and the cold and clear "Taoranting" like a "Xiao Temple in the deep mountains," all that can be seen is only the "white clouds floating in the sky" and the "emerald mountains of Western Beijing"! It is truly "unlimited flat sand, no one to be seen," a good battlefield!</p>
<p>They reached their destination, took off their tops, and revealed the beauty of the muscles of men! They began to fight with force. Their fighting method was very special. It was not like boxing, with the two twisting into a ball. They first had one person take off his top and stand still, not moving, except for the parts that could be fatal, and the other person could hit him however he wanted, without being allowed to fight back. When the person being hit felt satisfied with being hit, and the hitter was exhausted, they would rest for five minutes, sit on the ground, and still talk and laugh as usual. After the rest, they would repeat the process, changing people to hit. The two had agreed in advance that if anyone shouted "Ouch!" in their mouth first, then they would "show weakness"! They would tacitly admit that they were "defeated"! They would not be considered "heroes."</p>
<p>After the first day of fighting, no one made a call of weakness, and without a winner, it was considered a "draw." The two reaffirmed their determination to continue their efforts! Come again tomorrow. On the way home, they talked and talked, as if nothing had happened. Only a few crows flew back and forth in the shadow of the setting sun, constantly calling, as if praising them as "good men"! "Good men"! Besides, no one knew about this "humorous secret."</p>
<p>In this way, they fought for a month, and still could not determine who was superior. Nor was it ever discovered by a third party.</p>
<h3>Miss Chen Yanyan Speaks Tearfully and Sadly: Movies Are My Life (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Cold Fragrance Notes</p>
<p>A History of Film with Eternal Regret</p>
<p>...A Chance Encounter When Entering the Screen</p>
<p>A relative of the family is the owner of the "Zhongtian Cinema" in Beiping City. I have loved movies like crazy since I was a child. Because my relative's family opened this theater, I had many opportunities to watch movies. At this time, I watched almost all Chinese and Western films, without exception. Many works by Ms. Yang Naimei, Ms. Zhang Zhiyun, and others made me watch them as if drunk and fascinated, to the point of watching five or six episodes in a row; - especially Ms. Zhang Zhiyun, I admired her the most, and can be said to be her most loyal believer. However, I didn't have any thoughts of entering the screen in my heart at that time. Later, in the early spring of 1931, I was eighteen years old: I suddenly encountered an extremely coincidental opportunity: Mr. Luo Mingyou initially founded the Lianhua Film Company in Shanghai, and he personally led Mr. Sun Yu and the late Ms. Ruan Lingyu and other staff to Ping to shoot the real scenes of the ancient capital for the first film "Dreams of the Ancient Capital"; at the same time, they happened to live in the hotel "Dongan Hotel" jointly opened by my father and uncle. From this, I gained a special opportunity to get close to them, following them around to watch filming during the day; and talking with them in the hotel room in the morning and evening; talking like that, they said that "you are also very good at filming and are a promising talent on the screen." One word moved me, and I was overjoyed, and suddenly ignited my fiery passion, and started further negotiations with them.</p>
<p>...Strict Father Lost Happiness and Died with Regret</p>
<p>The Lianhua authorities sincerely recruited me, and we hit it off as soon as we talked, and the terms of the five-year contract were also negotiated. Unfortunately, my father was extremely opposed and could not allow it. His old ideas thought that movies were not a very proper profession, and girls mixed in it were very easy to learn bad habits. Originally, I also knew my father's intentions. In the past, in order to study, he was unwilling to let me run to school, and to leave home to film movies was certainly impossible. However, I really liked movies too much, and no matter what, I must fight for this move to do this job. Therefore, I cried and cried at home and resisted very fiercely. I said to my father: The quality of people is uneven, that is always the case, not only in the film industry; people only need to make up their own minds, even if the environment is bad, they may not be assimilated. If I go there and I am determined to come back as a good person, I will not come back if I am not a good person.</p>
<p>My father was very sad to hear this. My mother did not add any opposition, but said: Wherever my daughter goes, I will go with her. Later, after many people persuaded him, my father just shook his head and sighed, and he also disliked the contract period of five years as being too far away, and he did not agree. And my opinion was that even if I signed a ten-year contract, I still had to go. Lianhua's contract, as a rule, had to be signed by the parents to be valid; under my father's firm insistence, it became the biggest obstacle in reality. Until the Lianhua foreign scene team finished their work and left Ping, I followed them on the train regardless of everything; my father rushed to the station immediately, watching me shed tears non-stop; an elder of the family was with him at the scene, seeing this stalemate, it was difficult to reverse, so he used a forced method to hold my father's right hand on the platform, and forced him to sign the contract by the car window, and then it was over. However, although my mother and daughter were full of joy when they arrived in Shanghai, and thus entered the film industry; my father was lonely and unhappy, and also always thought it was very wrong, and after only half a year, he became ill for me and died with lasting regret. (Speaking of this, tears fell, and I sobbed incessantly.)</p>
<h3>Ruan Meirong, One of the Outstanding Talents of the Xinhua Song and Dance Troupe</h3>
<p>— (Du Ao Photography)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from Liyuan</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Because Yan Jupeng's popularity reminded me of Guan Dayuan's frustration.</p>
<p>Since things are rare, they are valuable. Although Guan Dayuan's performance has nothing particularly amazing, he can always be described as stable. He would never be like a certain old actor (also a amateur who became a professional) invited by a certain stage this spring, who sang out of tune and out of sync, and was booed off the stage by the audience several times. How could the owner of the opera house invite such an actor? Isn't this too much of an insult to the audience? No matter how unsellable Guan Dayuan is, he is still a person with more than thirty years of stage experience. Moreover, he has been taught by famous teachers and has many plays in his repertoire. If he really comes to the south, he can also perform some old plays that are not often seen, to change things up. Plays and actors are the same, there are those that are timely and those that are not. In recent years, I have really been discussing "Catching and Releasing Cao", and these timely plays have made the audience's heads dizzy. If the wrong actor is allowed to sing the out-of-date plays that have been shelved for many years, it may make the actor popular and the play popular. What's so amazing about "Second Entry to the Palace"? Because there are a few more old words (fishermen, woodcutters, farmers, readers, counting the four seasons of flowers and the names of ancient people), it can actually cause a sensation. Even I, who don't listen to an episode of opera in a year, ran to taste the freshness, which shows that the friends in the opera circle also like the new and dislike the old. In fact, to put it bluntly, is not the new still dug out from the old stuff? Now I boldly say a word. If someone has a good voice and can sing plays like "Chopping the Son," "Xiaoyao Jin," and "Taking Chengdu," as long as he can make the audience feel happy, who will care about your Liu or Sun school? But the most important thing is not to use strange tones to please the audience, so as not to lose the status of a famous actor. (67)</p>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes of the Movie Star Photo Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengyong</p>
<p>The Chinese Movie Photo Photographers Association, in cooperation with the Shanghai Refugee Skills Training Center, held the Chinese movie star photo exhibition at the Daxin Company on the fourth floor yesterday (the 25th) at 10:00 am. At that time, it was drizzling, but the guests were still very enthusiastic. I also went to visit. I will now record the behind-the-scenes of the opening in a jumble to enrich this publication.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock, in front of hundreds of guests, Mr. Lin Kanghou first gave the opening speech, and movie star Yuan Meiyun cut the ribbon. Ji Zhiyou, Shi Yuejuan, Gu Lanjun, Li Hongzai, Miss Yang and others entered the venue one after another, and the audience rushed to the door to see the style, surrounding the movie stars in a circle. Although the staff tried their best to maintain order, they still had the pain of not being able to move. So Miss Mei Jun was left alone (because it was her day to sign autographs for movie fans who bought photos), and the rest hurried away.</p>
<p>On this day, Mr. Lin brought four children to the meeting, and watched the movie star photos on the wall in order. Especially when they walked to the towels, toys, embroidery and other products displayed by the Refugee Skills Training Center, they watched them very carefully, and asked the reception staff from time to time, looking very concerned.</p>
<p>What caught the eye in the venue were ten thirty-inch large color photos, with mirror frames, which were very pleasing to the eye. These photos are priced at one hundred yuan each, but if there are more than two people competing to buy, then the person with the highest price will buy it. Now a picture of Lu Ming has been ordered by Zhujiang Daily in Hong Kong via telegram, and Yantai Zhangyu Winery has ordered a picture of Zhou Xuan, but whether there are any bidders will have to wait until the end of the conference.</p>
<p>There are about five hundred other fourteen-inch photos, and dozens of them have been booked. For example, "Anonymous" ordered two copies of Chen Yunshang, one copy of Yue Cuiying, and a total of five papers. And many people had already ordered photos of Wang Yang the night before the opening. These gentlemen can be said to be very enthusiastic, and Miss Wang can also be proud of it.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to ask movie fans not to give up this rare exhibition, and to order more to benefit thousands of refugees, so that they have the opportunity to learn skills and become independent. It is truly a great merit!</p>
<p>Free "Mulan Joins the Army" Book Cards: The Shanghai Amateur Theater Charity Joint Performance will be held at the Golden Theater from the 24th to the 30th of this month. The plays will be performed in succession every day, and the grand occasion will be unprecedented. At that time, there will also be a kind of small book card of the woodcut book "Mulan Joins the Army" written by Chen Hejun, which will be given away during the performance of "The True Story of Ah Q" by Gonghualian. The small book card is extremely exquisite and beautiful, and is rare. Spectators should pay attention.</p>
