<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本為經濟而戰乎</h3>
<p>師出有名，直爲壯；抑不惟名實之辨，曲直之分不容假借而已；誰爲戎首，責任歸焉。中國爲求生存而抗戰，爲維護國族之獨立自由而戰，此必天下後世所共認；顧日本何爲而戰？</p>
<p>戰之初，日本謂中國之遼吉黑三省爲彼生命綫所在，故爲爭生命綫而戰；夫以鄰國之人民領土富藏爲生命綫而欲以武力攘爲已有，曲寗待言。戰之中途，日本謂中國共產化，彼爲剷共而戰；夫中國以三民主義立國，雖共產黨亦宗奉之，可知共產化說之爲誣妄；况鄰國主義，於彼何與！日本又謂東亞需新秩序，彼爲建樹新秩序而戰；夫何謂新秩序，日順我者生，逆我者亡，以鐵鞭奴役異族至於永遠不得翻身；建樹新秩序即建樹主僕關係之謂，豈有他義。日本又謂以國運作孤注矣，故爲置中國主權於彼統制之下而戰；（五月二十四日日本外務省發言人語）此其措辭立義之邏輯，無以異於曰我拚命冒險，故操刀殺人。凡此云云者，支離滅裂，萬無一是；宜乎戰爭經年而彼國會中人猶質問其當局曰：日本何爲而戰耶？</p>
<p>惟中國抗戰之本質，極爲明顯；故欲中國之不復戰，祗須還中國以主權土地行政之完整。惟日本之師出無名，故惟有以戰爭解決戰爭；申言之，非任彼勝至不必再戰，即使彼敗至不能再戰而已。若於戰爭之外，別求解決戰爭之道，世人殆久已不作是想；乃昨日倫敦電傳，英國巴許爵士Sir　George　Paish發表宏論，其要旨有云：</p>
<p>「日本國內對於該國政府現行政策，見解不一，工商業人士，均不贊成對華作戰，並以爲和平乃爲貿易最佳之途徑。「今茲遠東局勢之造成，實爲世界經濟政策之直接結果。蓋各國皆厲行關稅保護政策，日本全國人口一萬萬人，每年增加一百萬，本國資源極爲有限，雖全境均已闢爲耕地，但實際上仍爲貧窮之國，該國商界及軍人以外之一般人，均曾語余，準備解決中國問題，願與中國友好相處，但如何以達到此項目標，而又不致喪失顏面，則非彼等所知，要而言之，日本務當退出中國，但此層倘欲辦到，應在世界上爲日本籌畫前途，俾克銷售其貨物，從而給　其人口，俾克維持其合理的健康。至以軍事方面而論，日本金融窘迫，不能聽任現行局勢長此下去，由此觀之，日本將在短時期之內，採取合理的態度明矣。」</p>
<p>巴爵士者·英國之名經濟學者，赴日游歷·纔歸英倫，隔昨應國際問題某集會之邀而演講如右。來電傳述，宜不及所講之十一，精義殆不外此。其間論因證果，灼見眞知，自爲各國注意日本戰時內情者所樂聞；雖右舉片段之中，亦頗有不成因果之數點，是必電傳簡略，當非名學者而矛盾也。我人逖聽之餘，所不能已於言者：巴許爵士稱日本爲貧窮之國，復以遠東現狀爲世界各國現行經濟政策之後果，似乎日本發動侵華之原因在此；又謂世界應爲日本籌謀經濟之出路，似乎結束日本侵華之方法在此。誠如巴許爵士之說，則日人與非日人所懷「日本何爲而戰」之疑問，答案在於斯矣。雖然，其然乎？</p>
<p>巴許爵士，經濟名學者也；仁者見仁，智者見智，故經濟學者對於一切現象之見解在經濟。抑我人不以巴許爵士之見解爲偏見。原人類文明進化之跡象，閱數千百年而至現代；縱而爲國際問題，橫而爲社會問題；爲謀問題之解決而委之於宗敎或一般文化，或求之於科學，甚至訴之於戰爭；舉以歸諸經濟，是亦我人所願坦白是認。是巴許爵士之說，根本不謬，所惜乎日本並不如此；退一步言之，日本在事實上無逃乎此法則，所惜乎日人不自覺其如此。蓋當世之國際爭競，無論政治措施，軍事規畫與行動；各以經濟爲觀點，則政治與軍事皆工具也。日本則不然，方懵然醉心於貫徹其軍事之理想，完成其政治之願望，彼視經濟爲工具而已。故於侵華之初期乃至今茲，彼當局之種種說明與種種表示，未嘗提示其欲求乃在經濟；更自根本批判其武力侵略行爲，且違反經濟之鐵則。我人在此短文之中，固不遑詳爲論證；然至少以中國歷來在遼吉黑諸省，所予日本以發展經濟·救彼貧窮之機會，彼未嘗致全力於運用，可以反證日本之意識與欲念之不在經濟；亦即九一八以後之侵華事實，數年來之遠東禍患，原因皆不在經濟。</p>
<p>遠東事，曲在日本，責任在日本；而日本之意識與欲念，却不在乎經濟；則巴許爵士所建議，爲日本經濟而籌謀，不足以促日本之幡然改圖，有可斷言也。是以今日之事，在中國以抗戰爲不二法門，在各友邦亦必體認以戰爭解決戰爭之外，不必存何希望。若希望解決於戰爭之外，必待日本大徹大悟，放棄其政治願望與軍事理想！吾則，予彼經濟生路，徒以加强其政治之野心，加强其軍事之擴展而已。</p>
<h3>日侵華計畫失敗　蘇聯消息報發表論文</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　消息報頃發表「日本侵華戰略計畫之粉碎」一文、分析蘆溝橋日軍挑釁以來之戰局發展云、「日帝國主義於準備侵略之際、原不願陷入對華長期作戰之泥坑、日本法西斯因本國經濟資源有限、乃力圖速戰速決、俾保全實力準備進一步之侵略、因此、日閥一切作戰企圖、均爲」决殲滅華軍、迫使中國政府投降</p>

<h3>英蘇合作　談判的癓結</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>兩方對於步驟的準備不一致　同時對同盟完成見解亦岐異　關於互相信賴方面復雜確立</p>
<p>倫敦通信</p>
<p>談來談去的英蘇合作談判，到現在，還是耍這麼談下去。大概要等到另一個「危機」。到來時，才會進一步的飛應，使牠固體化，茲僅就目下的形勢，爲簡略的紀述。</p>
<p>（一）三種不同的疑問</p>
<p>據一個目擊者叙述，當最近一决蘇俄答覆到英外部時，現仟外相的哈立法克斯一看，就立刻抓抓腦袋，向一個往訪者說；「這些俄國人眞難繼呀！他們到底要的什麽呢？」這一疑問，正是十足地代表了一般英國人對於目前的炫惑。然而，那癥結所在，哈立法克斯外相本人，是分明曉得的：當然允其淸楚的，還是以路易喬治·邱吉爾·艾登·等人爲領袖的英國開明人士。</p>
<p>可是在另一方面，現兼任蘇聯外交人民委員長的莫洛托夫，却又在正式演說裏，公然地問着：「英法現在的當局，是眞想抵抗侵略麽？」他的話，想起來也當然是代表了斯太林以及蘇聯一般人士的意見。一不過，不管他們兩方面的主觀態度如何，站在第三者地位的，對於英蘇同樣友好的國家，最關心的，却是這種合作談判的具體成立，因而，在目前的波蘭·土耳其·等國，那普遍的疑問，却是：「這其間的癥結，到底在什麽地方？」這相彷的情形，或許也可以適用到現在與波土處在同樣對英蘇有着友好關係的我們中國。</p>
<p>（二）癡結在那裏</p>
<p>單是從兩方面的提議，反提議，以及負責進行談判當局們的表示去看，似乎是，兩方面的差別，巳經大部份消弭，剩下來成爲問題的，眞是如英政府前些日子所說；僅僅是「方法和技術」的問題而已。不過，要眞是僅僅幾個問題話，那末，牠們是阻止不了英蘇合作，（現在通用的說法，是英法蘇三國同盟）具體成立的。現在的最大癥結，却在於所謂一方法和技術的問題之外。</p>
<p>總共起來——</p>
<p>第一個當前的癥結，是兩方面對於共决步驟的準備不一致。——首先，是成立一反抗侵略的英法蘇三國的同盟，這一，在原則上，已經都加以接受了。可是成立了這種同盟之後的其决步驟呢？在英法方面，是準備立刻以這三國同盟爲背景，向德意開始接洽一個最後的妥協，那意思，自然是說，還打算着作相常的讓步；而蘇聯方面，這樣子，她是認爲自己充了英法對德意討價還價交涉中的「猫脚爪」，在她本身，是毫無意義而且危險的。她的意思，却是希望以這基礎，去重新樹立集體安全制度，維護一切國家的領土主權，已有的侵略裁判牠，未來的，抵抗牠；這在英法却又認爲是會「危害和平」，而不肯予以贊助。那末，怎麽樣呢？目前，折中途徑，還並沒有能够發現出來。因而這就搆成了當前的癥結之一。</p>
<p>第二個當前的癥結，是兩方面對怎麽算是同盟完成的見解，還沒有達到一致。——遠一點的，有歐戰時意大利脫離德國，投到協的國方面，倒戈自肥的例子；近一點的，有去年慕尼黑會議時，雖是有著互助同盟關係，而也參加出賣捷克的法國外交的例證。今而後，在這種國際關係千頭萬緒的環境裏，一紙空頭條的拘束力，是完全沒有了。那末，要是想使同盟關係，眞能發生拘束力，當怎麼樣呢？這一點上，近來公開出來的德意同盟，還有目前還沒有公開出來的德意與西班牙的同盟，甚至最近在進一步加强着的英法同盟，就供獻了三個很好的例子。按照這些例子，必須通過了三個步驟，同盟關係，方可算具體確定了的。那步驟，　條的上的同盟成立，　兩方面參謀部的談判，隨之而來，由之成立未來作戰兩方參加軍力的大致支配，　以最後默契，混同了兩方的作戰力量，這樣，戰起來以後，勝是一塊兒勝，敗也敗在一處，絕對不允許一國先和敵軍妥協，成立部份的和平。能這樣，方算是眞正的「同盟」。可是，在目前進行着的英法蘇同盟中，雖然英國方面，在宣稱着，一等蘇聯同意並簽訂同盟條的以後，那末，英法蘇間參謀部的談判，當隨之而來；但照目前情形看，那不過僅是一個形式，英法最迫切要求的，還僅僅是第一步的同盟條的的簽訂。這當然是不能滿足蘇聯要求的，她的意思，是主張貫澈上述的三個步驟，吾則的話，就不如根本沒有這回事。所以在最近蘇聯就曾經向英法耍求過先給以保證；萬一戰起來時，大家都不去個別談和。所以這時候英法眼中的所謂「同盟」和蘇聯眼裹的比較起來，程度上是大有差別的。我想，不久後總會找出彼此合意之點的吧，然而在目前，這却又成了癥結的第二個。</p>
<p>第三個當前的癥結，是由於互信的難以確立。——英國張伯倫內閣，道一年多以來所循的路綫，在蘇聯方面，已經造下了根深蒂固的懐疑。而這一回，突然掉轉來，和蘇聯談判合作，這種行動的兀突，短期內難以取得蘇俄的信任，是必然的。雖然邁斯基現仟駐英大使，曾奉召回國，報告英國一般人士們傾向蘇俄的態度，允其是國會反對派等議員的一致督促政府親蘇，然而，照邁斯基回任後的形勢來看，蘇聯對於張伯倫內閣的信任，依然是毫無改進。上倘禮拜，哈立法克斯外相會向張伯倫首相建議過，準備派艾登去蘇聯直接和斯太林·莫洛托夫·舉行談判，這建議，目前仍然在考慮之中，將來能吾實現，固然成問題，即使實現後能否生效，又是一個更大的問題了。還有，從蘇俄方面看，以前主張舊的集體安全制，以國聯爲工具，制裁德國最力的李維諾夫，是不在台上了。換上來的莫洛托夫，根本不過是兼職，而斯太林自己，却在傾向上，無寗是看重遠東，而漢視歐洲局面。英國現任政府對於蘇俄，這些天來，始終在兩個矛盾的顧慮間打圈子；完全軍事同盟成立，担心蘇聯會立刻格外偏重遠東，不再爲歐洲分勞，吾則，又怕斯太林會和希特拉來一個默契，一個向遠東致力，一個在歐洲勒詐。不過這一點，僅祇是心理上的障礙，如果前述的第一·第二·兩點解決，這是不搆成什麼癥結的。然而，爲了說明目前談判困難的眞實情形，我在這裏，也把牠列爲第三個癥結。</p>
<p>第四個癥結，方是所謂「保證波羅的海沿岸各國獨立」的問題。如果英蘇在第一·第二：兩點上能得到一致，那末，這一點可以絲毫不成問題。然而在這時候，蘇聯提出這一點，實際上是給英法一個大大的難題：那意思，自然是試騐英法在第一·第二·兩點上，可吾完全同意蘇聯的觀點。我們必須記住，這一年多以來的敎訓，已經令一些歐洲弱小的國家，澈底覺悟了兩件事；一·英法是不會關心她們利害的，必要的，還會拿她們送給德意作爲緩和自已與德意間危機的犧牲品；二·蘇聯是不會在英法未加入前，單獨爲她們作戰的，頂多是物質上帮助；而她們自身呢，却又並不是僅僅靠了帮助，就可對抗德意的國家。所以，必然的結論是：如果德意能自動不侵犯她們，那是最理想的了；這狀態，她們自稱是「絕對中立。」現在，希特拉已經先英法一着，自動和她們訂立「互不侵犯協定」了，這一來，不獨解除了她們對於自己領土主權被侵的担心，同時，也暗示給蘇聯；德國和蘇聯間，在蘇聯西方邊境衝突可能，到現在，是完全除去了。這時候，如果英法去保證她們的安全，毫無疑義的，要被嚴厲拒絕，耍是想她們接受保證，祗有一個法子那就是先成立英法蘇間的完全同盟關係。然而蘇聯却又巧妙地把牠當作英法所提出方式下同盟的大前提，這眞是令英法當局麻煩的事。</p>
<p>說來說去，其餘一切，都是比較的枝節困難，最重要的，還是在於上述的第一·第二·兩點，如果英法蘇間，在這兩點上，可以取得一致，那末，一個同盟關係，可以立刻實現。這一同盟的實現，不獨將帶給締的國以安寗和繁榮，且同時也當帶給全人類以光明和進步。（六月九日）</p>
<h3>日艦殘害漁民　香港方面之血賬　漁民被殺者者一尤餘人　財產損失二千萬以上</h3>
<p>香港通信、自八一三滬戰發生後、日本海軍、即對華方海岸錢、予以非法封鎖、因而沿海岸綫之漁民、乃慘遭空前厄運、溯由前年九月份起、僅香港方面之漁船、凡出海捕漁爲業者、輒被日艦截留、漁民生命、旣不得保、漁船亦被焚燬、船中財物、更遭洗刧、此等事件、幾無日無之、最初曾有一部份漁船、接納政府當局之勸吿、在戰事時期、暫停出海、然而歷時旣久、數萬漁民生活、實成問題、勢不能坐以待斃、因此不久時間、港中漁民、又復冒險駕船出海作業、置生死於度外、若遇日艦、則設法逃避、旣被捕獲、則竭力抵抗、最後則壯烈犧牲、造成漁民遭害之空前紀錄、</p>
<p>被害統計</p>
<p>港中漁民、每决出海遭難後、其逃生者、即向僑港漁民協會報吿、漁會在過去一年餘、彙集各方報吿、經將漁民遭難情形、呈報祖國政府當局、據該會最近發表統計報吿、由前年九月至去年十二月底止、本港漁船在港海外被日艦焚燬者、共六百二十八艘、漁民遇害者一萬零九十二人、由本年一月至五月底止、五個日內、漁船被焚燬者十六艘、失踪者三十四艘、平均計算、漁民遇害、又一千二百零五人、由前年九月至本年五月底止、計在二十一個月內、被焚燬之漁船、共六百四十四艘、漁民遇害統計一萬一千三百四十二人、上述數目、僅係根據漁民報吿、加以統計、其他米有到會報吿者、尙未列入、估計香港漁船被焚燬及失踪者、二十一個月來、總在一千艘以上、的計漁民船隻金錢損失、其數目達二千萬元之巨、</p>
<p>摧殘經過</p>
<p>根據漁民報吿、日艦在港外對漁民摧殘、大致可爲三個時期、第一時期、則施威嚇、每遇漁船在海外作業、則施以焚燬第二時期、則對漁民施行懐柔政策、利誘漁民、施以蠱惑、最近爲第三時期、則施行據刦政策、因此最近五個月來、本港漁船失踪者特多、失踪者人船均被擄去、祇由其同帮出海者逃返報吿、日兵除搶奪財物外、漁民子女、允爲此輩之目的物、查每一漁拖、平均的有兒童六七人之多、多被擄去、聞係施以奴化敎育、藉以補充其國內壯丁、</p>
<p>被誘附日</p>
<p>允足痛心者、則爲無知漁民、竟然被誘附日、刻下三門關附近、已有一部份漁民、被日方收買、據從三門關返港之漁民報吿、該處現有若干漁民、為日方利誘、竟作漢奸、結成集團、代日方運輸糧食、復受日艦保護、在沿海一帶捕魚、而香港漁船駛至該處、則被日艦焚燬、過去日艦、在港海各處據去之漁船、亦多停泊於該處、漁民協會據報後、爲防止無知漁民被日方吸引起見、經積極向漁民勸吿、出海捕魚、應審愼注意、勿駛近三門關附近、免遭不幸、而多數漁民亦鑒於在該處捕魚、過於危險、未敢駛往該處、改在陸豐甲子碣石平海澳頭等處捕魚、以避免據刦、</p>
<p>籌劃善後</p>
<p>至漁民附從日方之原因、則由於生活困難、致被利利誘、國內軍政當局、有鑒及此、特進行改善漁民生活、最近第　戰區司令部、爲調査廣東沿海居民生活狀况、進行改善起見、特組織廣東東海區漁鹽視察團、派赴沿海各地視察、該團日前抵港、轉赴寶安、在港期間、曾向僑港漁民協會調查一切、由該會提供關於漁民生活狀况之參考資料甚多、並將不法公務人員向漁民敲詐各種情形、詳細報吿、請求當局澈底改善、俾得解決漁民生活困難、並由漁會具備呈文書面、向當局報吿、俾得設法改善、</p>

<p>之日本海軍陸戰隊、在該市設有司令部、並有日本陸軍與特務隊駐守、日本興亞院亦設有總辦事處、靑島之十六萬人口中、日人佔二萬三千人、每月增加五六百人、蓋自日本駛往靑島之輪、均滿載日人也、靑島日方產業之被毀者、計日金四萬萬元、雖有若干刻在重建中、然日本缺少資本、故進行遲緩、日軍侵佔靑島雖已年餘、但損失達日金二三千萬兀之鐘淵紡績廠、迄未開工、日方至今尙在計劃先使該廠一部份復工、卽自日本運往靑島之紡織機器、亦屬陳舊不堪者、日方接收之麵粉廠一所、雖已開辦、但不能獲得長江流域之小麥、而魯省與其他華北諸省內地所產小麥亦無法獲得、據該廠日籍經理稱、此因「各鐵路錢車輛不足」之故、但日方此種解釋、殊與事實不符、蓋非車輛不敷、實因日軍槍刺尙</p>
<p>未能控制</p>
<p>鄕區、而華籍農民、亦迄未表示願以農產、襄助日本在東亞建立「新秩序」也、日海軍常局、爲圖便利內地產物運出起見、已寬弛對魯省海岸之封鎖、並准帆船行駛河道中、然已組織船舶公會、檢査船隻、以防私運貨物接濟游擊隊、靑島白俄一千人、由日軍爲之組織反共聯合會、而利用作「自動的」示威游行等、靑島市外、景象全非、鐵路綫由重兵防守、日方宜稱、魯省游擊隊、多在靑島以東之勞山與濟南東南之羣山中、但魯省之一百零七縣、一省府」僅委縣長七十六人、且其中三分之一以上因一體弱之故、」照支縣長月俸、而迄未赴任、足證他區亦有華軍活躍也、五月間、日機恒向烟台附近之華方游擊隊轟炸、魯省交綏之消息、雖不若華北其他部份之頻繁、但觀察家相信、此乃日軍擾動該地「蜂窠」較不活動之故、</p>
<p>膠濟鐵路</p>
<p>爲內地富源運往靑島之重要動脈之一、游擊隊本年內襲擊鐵路决數大减、華方消息、謂此因游擊隊顧全羣衆利益之故、蓋某地鐵路綫被拆除、日軍即向該區村民施報復也、游擊隊明瞭此舉不利於農民、乃寬弛其破壞鐵路之活動、但此種襲擊、並未完全停止、此由日軍重兵防衛鐵路可表示之、坊子與張店間之路綫、長約八十哩、沿綫每數百呎即有守衛兵、此輩日本衛兵、駐守臨近鐵路之機關槍哨位、四週圍以有刺鐵絲網、其間每隔一定距離、復有簡單之塹壕、一二日兵駐守其中、並有若干地點、刻正建造新地下堡及塹壕與茅舍、鐵路旁之樹木悉已砍去、使襲擊者不易得庇護物、時而用馬達行駛之防護車、行於火車之前、以防鐵軌有被毀者、沿該綫兩旁、闊五至十哩之狹長地帶內、日軍已組織村民五千人、助其建設「新秩序、」村民之任務爲防護鐵路、不遭游擊隊襲擊、並警吿日駐軍何處有「匪、」日本軍官、豫料魯省內襲擊鐵路事、年內可終止、然彼等承認須至中國抗戰停止、游擊隊活動始將終止、據日軍某中將稱、魯省游擊隊、備有步槍機關槍與若干野戰砲、軍火較少、該中將並承認游擊隊個人之勇氣甚高、其人數半載前爲九萬人、今的二萬人、此日方軍官所舉數字不免稍具樂觀、據中外觀察家稱、目前游擊隊人數與半載前之數、相差無幾、就游擊隊活躍而論、</p>
<p>濟南四週</p>
<p>之區、爲最使日軍煩惱地點之一、濟南東南之羣山中，有海軍大將陳氏之軍隊、常離根據地出擊日駐軍、五月十六夜、華軍的六百名、用迫擊砲與機關槍進擊魯省東南部日駐軍、濟南日駐軍不得不急派軍隊援救被襲之小隊日駐軍、嗣據日方宣稱華軍襲擊之結果、日軍派兵四隊「肅淸」該區游擊隊根據地兩營云、其實游擊隊僅遷移其司令部而已、此固游擊隊常行之政策也、濟南日軍防守頗嚴、抵火車站之華人、均受嚴密搜査、入夜十時後、不准出入、但仍常有游擊隊</p>
<p>混入城中</p>
<p>買賣、時或略作反日活動、「省府」官員數人、曾在此日方控制下之魯省會中被暗殺、各街道與胡同中、日軍用卡車常疾駛而過、日人在濟南投資、不若靑島之鉅、所設者多爲酒肆與藝妓館等本月初、魯省日軍開始進攻海岸、隴海路津浦路與膠濟路閒之一百十三·一百十四師華軍及游擊隊十萬餘人、北平日軍當局、謂其目的在擊散此等反日份子」、而得控制棉花與花生出產之區、同時、其他華軍、則在烟台以南進攻、以圖「肅淸」日方所稱之新秩序」、凡此乃魯省現局之大略情形也、</p>
<h3>偽皇協軍團長　戈崇壽被擒</h3>

<h3>各業竭力推行　匯劃票據制度　金融業請中外銀行接受　滙劃貼水將予嚴格取締</h3>
<p>財政部馬漾兩電到滬後、銀錢業等均已遵辦、金融市塲、已趨穩定、提存風潮、亦已平息、各業商議推行滙制度、必須中外銀行共同接受、如欲杜絕投機、須取締匯畫貼水、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>市塲平靜</p>
<p>自財政部馬電規定滬市提款新辦法後、初施行之一二日、因各界不盡明瞭眞相、致一引起相當波動、但此項波動、即歸平靜、因除經營投機事業外、正當市民、每月有二千元可以支取、並不感受任何不便也、至工商業方面、除發給工資、另行申請不受限制、經馬電明白規定外、對貨款往來、並不必須現款、因劃票據制度、自實施之後、頗收成效、</p>
<p>滙劃制度</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向各業方面探悉、現各業連日正在商議、如何推行滙劃票據以替代法幣、業已得有相當結果、因上海商業、甬帮居相當勢力、而甬埠市塲、亦即採用滙劃制度、（即所謂過賬洋錢）並不解付法幣、仍無碍於商業之發展、惟此項滙劃票據、必須中外銀行共同接受、方可流轉、此事已在金融業鄭軍考慮中、最近必有相當解決、</p>
<p>提存平息</p>
<p>銀行方面在馬電辦法公布之前一星期、存款因受投機影饗提取者多、馬電辦法公佈實施後、情勢大變、聞二十二日各大銀行收入與提出對比、一約爲一九、二十三日變爲二八、二十四日上午轉爲三七、因人心已安、以前提出者、現仍存入也、預料今日以後情形更佳、蓋各界對於政府防止資金外流之苦衷、已能深切瞭解、</p>
<p>取締貼水</p>
<p>自滙劃制度實行後、以滬市人口之多、日常生活所需、均需以法幣支付、滙劃供過於求、劃頭求過於供、於是造成投機者之滙劃貼水、幸經中中交三行委託銀行準備委會之維持、對同業儘量供給、始得轉危爲安、今各業除竭力推行滙劃票據制度外、對於滙劃貼水如存在、實與部定之戰時金融政策不符、欲杜絕投機操縱、必須取締滙劃貼水、</p>
<p>考慮辦法</p>
<p>上海市商會對滙劃票據之貼水、會函請各金融機關取締、同時銀錢兩業公會有鑒於此、並爲安定金融計、通吿會員行莊、嚴格限制支付滙劃票據、使金融得保持常態、又財政部亦曾電囑嚴予取締、但事實上匯劃貼水之風、依然存在、經營此投機貼水者、爲一般小錢兌莊、而正式銀行及滙劃錢莊、並不經營此貼水業務、今金融界對取締貼水、在考慮之中、</p>
<h3>定海城失陷　團警扼守青嶺　縣府當局事先已有布置浙東各地連日迭遭轟炸</h3>
<p>自日軍在浙東之舟山羣島强行登陸後、當地自衛團及警察、曾予激烈抵抗、不幸沈家門及定海縣城先後失陷、地方秩序、甚爲混亂、自衛團均已撤退至附近山中、作遊擊戰、惟寗波安謐如常、德平·謀福、電吿先後抵甬、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>定海沈家門已陷落</p>
<p>舟山羣島爲浙東鎭海口外之海島、以產鹽及漁業區域、在軍事上無關重要、故向無正規軍駐紮、日軍前爲劫奪食鹽、維護其侵漁計劃、會將衢山及岱山兩島佔領、迄今已將一月矣、今突於二十三日上午五時、在飛機掩護之下、日艦向定海沈家門等砲轟、繼即强行登陸、當地自衛團及警察常予抵抗、旋因寡不敵衆、作壯烈之犧牲、不幸定海及沈家門先後失陷、目衛團等不得已、退入山中、作遊擊戰、地方秩序、亦無法維持、東嶽宮一帶大火、</p>
<p>青嶺一帶準備激戰</p>
<p>沈家門爲定海東南之唯一重鎭、爲舟山羣島漁業之根據地、距離縣城的八十華里、首先不幸失陷、於是登陸之部隊、即向定海縣城進攻、後縣城亦相繼淪陷、縣長蘇本善、已率領全縣警察及目衛團、由北門撤退至靑嶺一帶深山、整頓所有部隊、實行作遊擊戰、隨時襲擊登陸之日軍、至於地方情形、據德商魯麟洋行之高登輪、昨由石浦電滬、提及沈家門定海已失陷、地方情形混亂、居民聞亦已奉令退入深山、定海無錢電臺、原設在警察局內、自定海陷落後、電訊即完全斷絕、聞定海縣城及沈家門、均爲商廛櫛比之處、自不利於戰守、惟北門外靑嶺一帶、均爲崇山峻嶺、縣府當局、事先不無布置、故戰事將見在嶺上進行、</p>
<p>普陀等處嚴密警備</p>
<p>定海地方秩序狀態、因無綫電已斷絕、所以眞相一時無法明瞭、惟行駛寗波定海間之德商魯麟洋行之高登輪、及德商施毅德洋行之天寳輪、均已停止駛入定海、至於定海至沈家門之小火輪、亦已停止、又通航內港包括穿山·石浦·寗海·三門灣之帆輪、亦已停止開航、此外如普陀山等島、仍由定海縣所派之警察維持秩序、並已嚴密戒備、如日軍企圖登陸、即予痛擊、聞定海有一部份居民、巳避入普陀山、</p>
<p>日方全力建海軍港</p>
<p>査舟山羣島係集定海島橫島·岱山島·長塗島·桃花島·等大小島嶼而成、北控巴卡島·馬鞍羣島、南控菲山羣島、其間擁有象山浦·定海島·等各港口·且為漁產豐富之區、居民大半業漁、日方此次先行佔據岱山、今復在沈家門定海續行登陸、其目的除侵奪漁產外、尙有在該處建立海軍港之企圖、故其登陸意義、殊堪重視、</p>
<p>浙東各地又遭轟炸</p>
<p>又據航業界消息、連日浙東各地仍迭遭日機濫施騷擾、各情如下、（一）鎭海於二十三日下午一時有日機十二架侵入、至江南小江投彈六十枚、燬屋百餘間、下午四時、又有日機一架飛范市鎭投二彈、燬屋五間、（二）慈北觀海衛、同日上午亦遭日機空襲投彈十枚、燬屋五十餘間、死十三人傷三十五人、（三）鎭北龍山方面、二十三日亦有日機二架投彈多枚、燬屋十餘間、傷平民三人、（四）象山方面、二十二日上午有日機三架侵入、至南門羊行街等處投彈轟炸、象西某中學被炸燬校舍七八間、死傷平民數人、</p>
<p>日艦焚掠衢山民船</p>
<p>衢山五豐魚棧等、僱有、裝運黃魚鮝五百件、由衢山揚帆駛往紹興、途經東沙角東墾山附近、爲日艦所扣留、先予檢查、將魚鮝劫去、搬至東沙角交通銀行堆棧舊址藏置後、即將鹹蛋船從火焚燬、損失約值幣五萬元、又鎭海峙頭山洋面、日前有民船一艘、爲日艦縱火焚燬、被難同胞六人、由煤炭船救回、狼狽逃至峙南鄉公所、請求救濟、</p>
<p>寗定兩同鄉會焦慮</p>
<p>本埠寗波旅滬同鄉會、自得定海遭遇不幸消息後、甚爲關念、現已去電當地電詢眞相、迄未得復、同時定海同鄕會、亦經去電定海、詢問情形、亦未得復、想見政府機關已全撤退、</p>
<h3>銀錢兩業議決　安定市面辦法　由準備會辦理領用同業匯劃　總額暫定五千萬元卽日登記</h3>
<p>本報二十五日重慶電、據財部發言人聲稱、本部此决限制滬市提存辦法原係鑒於近來滬市提取存款、競購外匯之風甚盛、爲安定金融起見、乃有前項暫時之緊急措置、仍希望在短期內市面回復原狀、當斟酌情形、即將前項辦法取銷、故原令內已聲明係暫時辦法、至二十六年八月十五日公布之安定金融辦法、亦已由部通電仍繼續有效、</p>
<p>自財政部馬電限制提存辦法到滬後、銀錢業連日討論、請求財政部充分接濟法幣、以資應付、茲由新聲社記者探得銀錢業公會方面議有安定市面辦法四條如下、</p>
<p>一·凡二十八年六月三十旦爲止、各銀行·各錢莊·及其他金融機關·結存銀行業聯合準備會·及錢業準備庫之滙劃存款、的計二千二百萬元、由準備會按百分之九十五、准予調換法幣、</p>
<p>二·由前項滙劃存款調成之法幣自二十八年七月四日起分十二個星期支付、每行莊每星期至多調取十二分之一、但各行莊結存餘額在一萬元以下、而該行莊爲應付存款須提前調取者、經準備會審査屬實、得酌量提前調付之、</p>
<p>三·自二十八年七月四日起準備會開始辦理各行莊領用同業滙劃事宜、各行莊均得提供担保品、向準備會申請領用同業滙劃、其領用辦法另訂之、</p>
<p>四·本辦法經上海市銀錢業同業公會聯席會議決議施行並悉此項辦法、係上海各銀行·錢莊·對於銀行準備會及錢業準備庫問結存之同業匯劃存款餘額而言、至各行莊對外所有滙劃存欠、仍照舊辦理、再聞準備會辦理各行莊領用同業滙劃、其總額暫定爲五千萬、即日開始登記、</p>
<h3>囤戶大宗脫售　食米供過於求　租界管委員會明日開會　連日來源暢旺人心大定</h3>
<p>本市食米問題、自經租界當局迭决召集米業領袖商討限價、茲市塲交易、決照當局規定限價辦理、故昨日市塲秩序恢復、米價穩定、租界當局、對於食米問題、頗爲注意、於可能範圍內、竭力設法疏通來源、遏止漲勢、惟各地來源、目前仍未見暢旺、十三期存米調査、今日發表、茲分誌詳情於次、</p>
<p>秩序恢復</p>
<p>滬市米價漲勢、日前飛黃騰達、呈歷來所罕有之現象、據悉其猛漲原因、不外囤戶操縱、有意默守觀望、嗣經工部局屢决召集米業領袖、商訂米糧限價、及穩定市塲秩序後、茲米市塲除頭號白米遵照當局規定限價交易外、中次各米、均經米業團體公議議定標準價格、米市塲昨晨九時開盤、十二時收盤、秩序恢復、米價穩定、皆已遵照新定限價交易、人心較前安定、上午共成交七千三四百包、</p>
<p>供過於求</p>
<p>邇日以來、天氣已漸趨炎熱、黃每時節已至、所的存儲米棧鉅量白米、勢難久藏、前日因米價步趨高漲、故大戶堅不脫售、米價猶看上漲、圖獲厚利、今市塲所有米價、均經當局限定、大戶見此情勢、已大批求售、俾免爛蛀、故市塲現貨籌碼、頓見充足、又因法幣頭寸短少、而買賣交易交割、均以現鈔為主、交易因之清淡、目前已呈供過於求之象、各等米價、均較限價爲低、平均各降落二三角、</p>
<p>當局注視</p>
<p>兩租界當局、對於界內民食問題、頗為關懷、前曾派遣探捕馳赴米市塲干涉操從者之騷擾市塲秩序、有意散佈謠言、提高市價後、卒因外滙暴縮、米業奸商藉故漲價、兩租界當局鑒於百物繼續騰漲、市民生活、已不堪負祖、若米價再行高漲後、影響平民生計、誠匪淺鮮、故迭次召集米業代表、商討應付辦法、現已訂定米市新限價、然兩租界當局對於市塲交易秩序、仍深切注意、茲租界米糧管理委員會已決定於明日（星期二）下午二時召開管理委員會議、聞屆時將討論疏通國米來源、及穩定市塲米價、</p>
<p>存米調查</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業同業公會負責調查存米、茲第十三期業於昨日結束、決於今日由公會發表、據米業界消息、本市米糧存底、雖因來源稍减、現仍極度豐厚、各米棧存米數在五十二三萬包以上、況各米號門售部及市民購積囤積、其總數亦在五六十萬包左右、故本市民食、決可無虞匱乏、</p>
<p>來源暢旺</p>
<p>各產米區域、近日經各幫販商竭力採購後、運滬國米、已漸趨增多、日來到貨、較前有增無減、　二十四日水陸到貨計八千包、二十五日亦計運到五六千包、昨日水陸兩路、運到二千餘担、至於米業交易、無論市塲·容帮、皆照向例規定、仍以一律現鈔支付貨價、業經豆米行業公會執監聯席曾議決通過、公佈市塲一律遵照辦理、</p>
<p>扣船放行</p>
<p>各地貨主及滬地米商前往產地採辦之米由產地運滬、在閔行等處被扣後、曾引起市塲對來源焦慮而發生漲風、茲據米業中人言、該項被扣米船、的達三十餘艘、現經貨主向各方疏通、並繳納各種捐稅後、已獲放行業有八九艘到滬、尙有二十餘艘、日內亦可續到故日後米船來滬、均可按例開入、被阻事件、可望减少、</p>
<h3>證券暗市今日開市　統一各債應還本息已有辦法　復興公債七月十日照常抽籤</h3>
<p>財政部對維持債信、始終如一、七月三十一日到期之統一公僓、甲。乙·丙·丁·戊五種債票應付本息、已定有相當辦法、届時由財部公佈、國僓基金管理委員會對關稅担保之復興公債第七决還本抽籤、準定七月十日舉行、至於上海之證券暗市、前因交割未清及限制提存、於是自二十二日下午起、暫行停市二天半、擬於今日（星期一）起開市、惟預料開市之後、交易勢必銳减、因市塲現鈔缺乏、使投機者操縱困難、</p>
<h3>中法借款成立　協助西南建設　法國將以鐵路材料運華　羅傑士兩週　內將赴倫敦</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、咋日（二十四日）本埠接香港消息稱、法政府貨款予中國一事、經長久之談判後、卒於六月二十三日正式吿成、其數額爲英金一百五十萬鎊、該借款之主要目的、目下未能詳知、惟據香港消息靈通之各界稱、法政府貸予中國之借款、其性質與前英政府貸予中國之出口</p>
<p>信用放欵</p>
<p>同、故法國今後將以建造聯接西南各省與法屬越南之鐵路公路所需各項材料運至中國、香港華人各界對於中法借款之成立、皆認爲法政府具有遠見之另一明證、聞此項借款之能早日訂成者、駐華法大使戈斯默爲有力焉、昨傳李滋羅斯爵士不日將</p>
<p>復蒞中國</p>
<p>一節、尙未由官方徵實、惟據香港消息靈通各界稱、中英平準基金委員會主席羅傑士、兩週內將赴倫敦、大的將偕李滋羅斯爵士同返香港、苟無充分之時間、羅傑士重慶之行將作罷、</p>
<h3>安全運動　收效宏大</h3>
<p>一週間肇禍事件　較上年大見减少</p>
<p>大陸報云、安全運動宜傳週已於上星期六晚結束、其成績之佳、遠出豫料之外、據用英語廣播之四電台發出消息、該週各馬路肇禍事件、較之上年同週减少百分之三十之多、據播音者稱、此全由普遍之敎育運動、始能收此良效、工部局之統計員昨日（二十四日）仍在彙集數字、並待各分捕房報吿馬路肇禍案、惟據稱安全運動宣傳週內馬路各種棨禍事件、較之一九三八年六月十八日之一週中的减百分之五十、工部局總董美克令曾在播昔電台致詞申謝租界內居民與工部局人員積極協助遝動之勞績、其他演說者、則諄勸市民勿忘是週所得之敎訓、今後仍賡續前功、造福社會、</p>
<h3>法公董局體卹僱員　一律增加薪給　並自六月一日起計算　經議董核准之後實行</h3>
<p>上海泰暗士報云、昨日（廿三日）聞諸可靠方面、法租界公董局因外匯最近低落、與生活程度高漲、為償補局中服務人員起見、刻擬增加全部僱員、（法人·華人·俄人與越人）之薪給、與外滙津貼、預料今日（廿四日）或星期一日經法公董局議董核准後、將自六月一日起實行、公董局學院之敎員亦將在</p>
<p>增薪之例</p>
<p>公董局擬調整薪給與自六月一日起實行兩事、昨由公董局某高級人員予以證實、但該員不知僱員之薪金將增加幾成據稱增加之百分率固已擬定、惟仍待議董核准、聞提交公董局之計劃、爲歐籍僱員基本薪金、月支七百元以下者、增百分這三十、七百元以下者、增百分之二十五、</p>
<p>華捕越捕</p>
<p>包括警官在內、均增百分之二十、以及米糧津貼每月一元五角、又聞對於歐籍僱員、並將給予孩童與房屋津貼、法公董局僱員昨日欣然等待正式宣佈加薪、以應付高漲之生活程度、但無人確知擬加若干者、殃僅作猜測而已、星期一日、可望</p>
<p>正式宣佈</p>
<p>又公共租界工部局銓叙委員會鑒於外匯之低落、將於月杪集會、議決給予僱員之調節費、雖迄今未正式發表消息、惟聞確將發給調節費、允其對於「B」級僱員爲然、因「B」級僱員之薪金、非若「A」級僱員之用外幣償付也、</p>
<h3>滬汕　航班恢復</h3>
<p>怡和太古照常儎運容貨</p>
<p>日軍在汕頭登陸、發生戰事、滬汕間航班、曾一度被阻、茲據航業界消息行駛滬汕錢之英商太古公司濟南輪、曾於二十三日晨在英艦保護下安全抵汕、起卸貨物、怡和洋行阜生輪、茲於二十四日由滬開抵汕頭、安全入口、怡生輪於二十五晨抵達、現太古·怡和·兩公司滬汕航班、巳正式恢復、裝運客貨、怡和洋行春生輪、定明日開往、日陞·太原·輪、定二十八日開往汕頭香港、</p>
<h3>滬津間　客貨運輸恢復</h3>
<p>天津租界爲日軍封鎖、爲時已達十餘日、滬津航班、曾一度停頓、以塘沽爲終點、茲據航業界消息、日前由滬開津之永生等輪、均安全抵津、未遭留難、英商太古·怡和·兩公司、巳派輪恢復天津班、今日有怡和洋行之春生輪、太古公司盛京輪開往天津、</p>

<h3>興化·泉州·香嶼附近外輸闢新航線日藉口軍事索海陸軍許可證外輸不願請領更改地名行駛</h3>
<p>閩省沿海之興化·泉州·香嶼·等口岸、出產之土糖·桂元、爲數至鉅、向屬內地口岸、外輪不准運輸、自中日戰事發牛後、</p>
<p>華商輸船</p>
<p>停航、外輪乘機行駛、當地政府爲貫通物產起見、亦予以諒解、因此一年以來、外輪獨享利益、運往之貨、以麵粉雜糧油餅爲大宗、輸出爲</p>
<p>桂元土糖</p>
<p>其數可觀、不料自本月一日起、日軍藉口軍事時期、上述三埠、非得日海陸軍許可、不得行駛、海關日籍稅司、亦皇皇通吿、各情已紀前報、迄今</p>

<h3>胸襟淡泊一塵不染聞蘭亭先生之訪問</h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>才過端陽，還是黃梅的時節，天氣已經酷暑逼人，無異盛夏。在二十四日的上午，坐上車子，膠輪在融化的柏油路上疾馳着，到得滬西的林密深處，眼見路旁多少碧梧，昂然與這强烈日光掙扎着，一下車，才領略到車內的沉悶空氣，還不如步行來得凉爽。</p>
<p>和聞蘭亭先生是事先的好會見時間的·我遞了名片，就登樓到聞先生一間古雅的客室裹，聞先生謙和地招呼我，在一霎那間，我不假思索，恍然我已置身在南京石板橋林主席的私邸。趁着談話還未開始的時候，憧憬着好像主席私邸裏底回憶。四週展望了一下，覺得這一閒小小的客室，差不多爲古瓶舊書所籠罩，中間一張方桌，還是古籍和筆墨的領域。聞先生長髯道貌，坐在中間，眞是恰到好處的，好像在那裹點綴這間古室，這一幅淸幽的情景，和林主席的滿室古物，典籍琳瑯，幾乎是初無二致</p>
<p>「詩有不如語妙，葉能勝似花香，」一副短短的聯，掛在我的對面，益信聞先生是一位談笑風生語妙天下的長者。對聯下面放着一張寶座式的籐椅，也有些像佛界的蓮座。我曾在南京見過諾那呼圖克圖的貨座，也是這樣的：我總以爲是相當年代的產物，可是聞先生說這是一位印度朋友送給他的，那末，還是一件富有古意的舶來用具呢！</p>
<p>聞先生感慨着目下民生的艱難，他每天讀報，對於工商經濟，很是關心。他猛然提到財政部馬電限制提存辦法的問題，他堅決說，限制辦法是用意很好，可是市上還有滙劃貼現，可就把限制失去了效力；所以旣限制則不應再有滙劃貼水，這一點希望政府和上海工商界應該切實設法的</p>
<p>他對於本報，頗加策勉，說是世界工商經濟的競爭已到了短兵相接的時候，申報對於有關工商經濟的紀述，頗爲詳明。希望更以指導的態度，使工商界增進智識，充實力量，於此可見聞先生對工商界靑年智識的增進，是非常的關心。</p>
<p>聞先生在工商界負有重望，已母庸詞費。他早年爲國家做了不少事情，可是他功成不居。我們在談話時，聞先生獨對於這一點說是一個國民盡他應盡之責，是不値得提起的。他說他早年也常常吸捲烟，因爲有一位學生吸烟而受責於老師，幾乎無地自容，他爲了替這位舉生乞情，感覺到自己也應該戒除捲烟的癖好，在民國十一年四月三十日深夜十時。他正在遊歷徐州雲台山的旅途中，他決心戒絕這個嗜好，至今十八年，始終與捲烟絕緣。他說：他生平一不說謊」，因爲已經說過不再吸捲烟，當然毫無通融地要履行言出惟行的信條。</p>
<p>他平時早上七時起身，晚間十時安睡，不睡午覺，生平毫無嗜好，酒是點滴不嘗。他養身之道，是生活有規律，在桌上放着韓非子等等書籍。他說他每日的時間，耗於書本上的佔大部份，允愛讀子書。在他四十六歲的時候，不幸遭到夫人去世，他對世俗夫死而婦守節，婦死而夫可續弦，堅決的認爲不平，他就在那年開始留鬚，決心不再讀弦。談到這裏，他掀顏一笑，說這二十四年來我旣未續弦，也沒有如夫人，這也不過行心之所安而已</p>
<p>他尤不同情於社會上婚喪喜慶動輒發柬的舉動，他從沒有印過請柬，他希望社會上糜費的酬應，應該减少，甚至要引爲痛戒。他茹素的動機，是因爲牲畜之類的不潔，後來友人勸他信佛，因爲他天性純厚，就開始讀經，隔了相當時間，就皈依了。</p>

<h3>欲成理想的夫婦　房事過勤宜速補腎</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞大醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>靑年男女互相戀愛，心上老刻畫着意中人的倩影，懷抱甜蜜的理想，這是多麼美而且樂的事啊　若再從天從人願進而結成正式夫婦，心上的戀人成了偕隨百年的伴侶，這種新婚甜蜜的樂趣，不是更使人迷醉的麼？</p>
<p>不過這種夫婦之樂，每因男女間過分的縫綣而感覺衰落，常有許多男女，當新婚之後，不知衛生，致不出數年，男的爆發腎虧早洩等症，女的亦因縱慾而貧血早衰，所以要使夫婦之樂水久如新，除宜節慾之外，隨時注意性力，免因房事而減弱。蓋「愛的基礎」，全由性慾之健全方能鞏固之，所以性機能之充沛，雖不能認爲夫婦生活全部幸福，然最低亦可認爲和好的關鍵，性機能若不得美滿，家庭中決不會幸福的，所以夫婦閒應當努力保持此性能之健康才是。</p>
<p>吾人的性力，在婚前若不知衛生，顯然會發生變化，但在婚後若房事過動，也會形影削瘦，面色蒼白，腎虧而早洩，耍研究此種病因，須先明瞭人體中主要腺器靑春腺的作用。靑春腺位於男子的睪丸及女子的卵巢全部。此腺器常會因婚前之自凟而斵傷，但在婚後，則每因縱慾而失却繁榮，故上述各症之發生，都屬此種原因。余爲性科專門醫師，在蘇俄習翳時，屢作種種有效的補救療法，經騐所知，最對症的方法，唯有施用眞正動物靑春腺素製劑德國男用「補體康」始有增精補血之效用，良由「補體康」功能促進新陳代謝之機能，補腦，補腎，補血，增速生殖器之發育，歐美無數之性病專家，均知該劑藥力準確，爲治療腎虧早衰之特效良藥，且藥性不含霸烈雜質，四季宜服，凡婚後失健者，一服卽愈，其女用「補體康」爲婦女貧血早衰，月經不調特效良藥，患不妊症者，一服卽孕。</p>

<h3>舊淋濁之新療法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>淋病固不論其新久，皆有向愈之望，其惟一之宗旨，在能全部加以肅淸，使其不留一個餘孼淋菌。肅淸淋毒，亦有其難易之分。蓋淋毒在初起易於掃蕩，而時日一久，往往變生肘腋，故驅除遂難耳，然非不治之說也。淋菌在前尿道時，其根據地未多，故治愈並非難事。但是一旦成爲慢性，則淋病之變症旣多，不但在醫生診斷上不易，而且治療上更難於措手。故許多人往往以淋毒一旦成爲慢性，便如宣吿死刑。實則並非一概而論。苟能作最新科學方法之治療，則縱遇到極其頑固而多年的老白濁，亦不能加以解决。</p>
<p>說起最新淋病之療法，從余多年之研究，與實騐，無過於德國淋病特效藥「克淋儂」效力之卓犖者。此藥係淋病學大師彼德博士所發明，不僅對初起淋病，如摧枯拉朽，卽根株已老之淋病，亦不難治愈矣？因「克淋儂」一藥，係根據非特異性療法所所製成。余往年負笈美利堅，已知此劑效力之卓特。歸國以還對「克淋儂」之信仰益堅。因余使用「克淋儂」以來，男女淋病如急慢性淋之攝護腺炎，精囊炎，睪丸炎，關節炎，膀胱炎，前後尿道炎，及女婦淋毒白帶，陰道炎，卵巢炎等，服用「克淋儂」皆能在三五星期中根本解决。男子淋病能同時外用「抗淋水」，女子外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，則奏效尤速。</p>
<h3>鞏固精關爲遺精的澈底療法</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>遺精爲什麼不易治愈？其原故大都因爲不知攝生，或仍躭溺自凟，故雖有良藥，亦覺難以爲力。</p>
<p>自凟遺精，爲男女靑年所易犯，女子除了易觸破處女膜及損害其純潔之處女精神外，弊害終不若男子之深。蓋男子每能阻碍生殖器發育，損傷精關，鬆敏其射精中樞，故有遺精，在白畫憂慮急燥之後，精液即自動流出，此外，尙有生理的遺精一症，爲壯健未婚者所難免，完全由夢誘而發，决數甚稀，且遺後絕不疲憊，不過意志薄弱者，易啟發手淫動機，漸轉入病理，使精神與肉體兩失健康！</p>
<p>要澈底根治遺精，必須先得鞏固爲精關，並戒絕手淫，避免操勞，但鞏固精關之最有效藥劑，首推德國出品之「耐而斯遺精片」，每於睡前進服三片，即奏當夜止遺之功，而宜精旣止之後，若身體虧弱，或素來先天不足，神經衰弱，宜服德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，頗有卓效。</p>
<h3>肺癆之特療</h3>
<p>— （肺病專科盛在强醫師）</p>
<p>肺癆乃非常之病，故稱之爲慢性的自滅症，但如能藉科學上之新智慧，以之解決可怖之肺病，却非難事。現憑吾人二十多年之經騐，確有理由相信肺病能由科學療法除之。而能仍恢復健全之境。因余恒用德國徒梅博士所發明之「補肺拿爾一，治愈初期，及二三期之肺病，如潮熱，盜汙，咳嗽，吐血，喀痰不爽，精神憔悴，食欲不振，氣喘如牛等等症狀，服用「補肺拿爾」，可以在四小時內止咳，智囊期內對於一切癆病症象，逐日減退，至多一個月，卽可將難愈的肺病，完全根本解决，打倒一切敷衍塞責，弄得病人不死不活之肺癆療法。直爲肺病特效之療法，無怪歐美各大肺病療養院，爭相賞用之也。</p>

<h3>淋病變惡不足悲觀</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋病本有易治之機會，而往往放手不去治療，是誠淋病治療界中一可惜之謬舉，淋病如一旦誤治，淋菌即獲到據點，以爲作進一歩之內侵，結果淋病之變症，就此百出，治療更爲棘手。凡此種種的病的原因雖多，而病家之誤服劣藥，及醫械局部手術，使淋菌遁竄內部，無異爲淋毒之帮凶，雖然，此種變症，並非絶對不治者，據經騐告訴吾人，許多淋病變成壞症，只要用科學療法以資挽救，則往往可以挽救垂敗之局，使之回春，余所經騐之二十年中屢見不鮮者也。考淋菌既然一極易逃竄之病原菌，則吾人之治療，即不應拘漏於局部也。况淋病之變症，淋菌大多已侵入三個系統，即侵入泌尿系者成爲膀胱炎，腎臟炎等，侵入生殖系者，成爲攝護腺炎，睪丸炎等，侵入血液循環系者，成爲關節炎等。有此種種變症，治療遂不容忽視矣</p>
<p>要治愈此等廣泛性之淋病，單用局部療法，實不足以概全部之淋病，余則恒用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，作內服劑，一方更用德國静電療法，及德國抗淋血淸，與夫X線電療等，適應而選用之。蓋「克淋儂」具有搜索廣泛的淋菌，而撲滅的功效，與彼一枝一節之局部殺菌，而抗淋血淸，尤能發揮「克淋儂」殺菌之效。因之遂能應手取效　診時：上午十時至下午三時自即日起，每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並贈價值一元之「性病全書」一册</p>

<p>本月份內因租界外「當局」需運猪捐稅之故、到埠之猪隻較少、是以應作猪船及猪棚之視察决數亦减少、調查員曾視察火災三决、俱鄰近牛乳棚或牲口廐房、幸皆未見殃及牲畜、除上述視察外、調查員並每日巡視兩租界內各區、並處理甚多申訴殘虐牲畜之事件、</p>

<h3>上海應改轉帳碼頭</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>I君，不僅為貨幣學專家，且現任本市金融界重耍職務，遵囑不宜佈其為人熟知之尊名，木文係針對再度限制提存與再度重用滙劃制度而發，蓋鑒於先前滙劃貼水之流弊，而籌根絕之方，轉帳制度，在寗紹等地，行使已久，莫不稱便，且無流弊，盼各界注意，並希共同研究，切實推行，如滙劃票據蓋轉帳截記，則將投機於滙劃貼現之門戶，完全杜絕，於是非特可恢復滙劃與法幣之平價關係，且可以防止資金之逃避，减少現鈔之需要，滙劃與現鈔之差價既巳消失，通貨之行動又限於正當的商業交易範圍之內，則物價亦得安定，滙市亦可平靜，惟合法的外匯需要，及正當的現鈔需要，宜如何改善申核制度？宜如何杜絕其所得之外滙與現鈔流用於其他？尙望國內賢達，羣起研究，本報當竭誠提洪本刊之地位，作公開磋商之所。　——編者</p>
<p>上海向稱現碼頭；自八一三戰事發生以來，滙劃祇准同業轉帳，不能隔日收現。於是上海之現碼頭，乃一變而為「轉帳」碼頭。惟事實上因（一）交換所可以「滙劃」貼現；（二）法院對於以滙劃票據給付房租，有認為無給付之效力者；致一般交易收付，咸以法幣為本位。以法幣為本位之結果，即加速資金之逃避，影響外滙市面，最近外滙暗市，由八便士二五，縮至六便士半，八一三以後之新存款，復限制支取法幣以五百元為限，人心惶惶，謠言百出，環境如斯，姑不論以前種種政策與辦法之利弊影響如何？但金融界為（一）鞏固法幣信用，（二）减少外滙基金流出，（三）便利正當工商業收付起見，似宜迅將上海金融市塲，乘機改為「轉帳碼頭。所有一般交易收付，應一律以「轉帳」為原則。不必另起爐灶，搖動人心；反為「華興」造機會，茲將鄙擬辦法列下，以供研究：</p>
<p>（一）自〇月〇日起，上海為「轉帳」碼頭，所有一切款項，槪以「轉帳」收付為原則。各種票據上加蓋「轉帳」兩字戳記，祇准同業轉帳，不能付現，其有特種原因，訂明以現款（法幣）收付者，不在此限。</p>
<p>（二）存款支付，八一三以前者，仍照向例辦理。八一三以後者，按照財部馬電辦理，即每週得支法幣五百元，逾限支付，概給本票。並加蓋「轉帳」兩字之戳記，祗可「轉帳」。</p>
<p>（三）銀行存戶，分現款（法幣）戶，與「轉帳」戶。凡以現法幣存入者，記現款戶，得支取現法幣。如以「轉帳票據存入者，記轉帳」戶。支取時即開給「轉帳」票據。</p>
<p>（四）內地滙款至滬，以支付「轉帳」票據為原則。</p>
<p>（五）銀行「轉帳　戶存款，因有發放工資等正當之用途，必需現法幣者，得申請交換所（假定此機關）撥給法幣。不取費用，並應盡量供給。</p>
<p>（六）「轉帳」票據，規定有法律上給付效力。可以付給房租等之用。</p>
<p>（七）「轉帳」票據，規定不得私自取費貼現。如有此項行為，法律上不予保障，並受法律上之制栽。</p>
<p>（八）原有匯劃票據，或滙劃帳戶，一律按交換所原價折算；作為「轉帳」票據，或「轉帳」之戶，此後不再有滙劃名稱。</p>
<p>（九）原有法幣戶，除六·二二·以核開照者作為法幣戶外，其餘均作為轉帳之戶。</p>
<p>同時最好將外滙行市酌量放長，並易地供給，吾則供給上亦應嚴格限制，以必需品有單據證明者為限。</p>
<h3>為抑制米價進一言</h3>
<p>— 劉直之</p>
<p>米業中人，每以供需失調，某方勒索，與囤商操縱持為本市米價狂漲之由。所謂供需失調，謂由於日軍在華之食用，私運返日，轉售華南華北，以及沿途攔阻，使商販裹足不前，上海乃陷入缺米之境；復引各期調查存米量漸减之報吿為其佐證。然長江下游，係全國主要產米區。平昔供應全國消費，今因運輸阻斷關係，縱有日方收買出轉口，但其數量決不致較平昔自由出轉口時代更鉅，乃係無可疑義者。况昨年日本米產豐收，在其關册上，華米進口又絕無僅有；反之，麥粉等糧食，且對華大量出超；足見其在華日軍的軍糧，一部份尙仰給於本國。且正因戰時貨運阻斷之故，上海適為內地過剩米產的主要尾閭。從日方報章雜誌所載，與淪陷區內某方所行之「經濟戰術」的事實觀之，彼等正以恢復淪陷區內之經濟，作為控制中國的對策之一。故內地運米來滬時之任　勒索，固係絕無疑義之事實；但必欲放米輸出銷售，亦為遂行其制華戰術，維持偽組織「財政」，以及在套買外滙目的下之吸收法幣等等計劃上所必取之道。故內地禁米出口，容或有之；但顯屬一時現象，藉以要挾，而達成其勒索目的。設上海米市堅持十四元原限價，則其勒索亦勢必適可而止。因其非將過剩米產輸出不可故也。寬放十四元原限價為十五元，以及今之遷就市塲漲風而再將限價高抬至二十一元，實屬失策之至。限價旣可寬放，勒索自可無窮；此不啻將操縱上海米價之權，授與某方無異！憑今日上海之存米言：公吿存量雖减，囤商一之積儲量則增。姑不問「囤商」與米商是吾一而二？二而一？囤商」之所以出現，以及所以脊「操縱米價」之能力，亦在未能堅持原限價耳。再者，「囤商」反正亦屬供方，故根本上並未打破上海食米之供需均衡；是以今日米價之在漲，米商自難辭居奇之責。遷就市塲漲風而將限價高抬至二十一元，亦不啻中計。民上九年春，上海米價限額雖亦曾達二十一元之最高紀錄，但以今昔之衡量不同，故本報巳指出今之限價，實已超過昔日三元之多。十九年春之米市暴漲，確由隔年荒歉，供需眞正失調所致。與今日存底旣豐，來源又勢必不斷之情形絕異。尙希常局能體恤民艱，作恃平之修正，並以租界行政力推行。吾則，操縱者一計可售，難保不繼續為之，則後患無窮矣。　——編者</p>
<p>上海自中日戰事西移後，便淪為「孤島惟其如此，一切便顯出特殊現象：在商業上，一邊因災民集聚，消費量激增，造成表面上的繁榮一邊因附近盡成廢壚，生產减少；並旦復因某方的盤佔和千方百計的壟斷與留難，不受外滙影饗的土產物價也漲。共中，允以最近米價在漲風潮，更令人憂慮。</p>
<p>然而，食米在今日的上海，據說至少還囤儲二百萬包左右，（根據熟悉市塲情形者的估計），而况內地運米來申的，又味嘗一日或斷，所以本市的食米，至少在目前不生問題。事實旣如此，則照供需定律的原理來說：今日木市的米價，儘可站住先前所定的限價不動，而且可無疑問。然而事實竟恰恰相反，上海的米價，旣跳出了十四元原限價，又打破十五元的新限價，今已飛漲至二十一元以上，使兩租界當局與米業團體，不能不以二十一元為目前的限價，其故何在？</p>
<p>第一：限價政策的不能站住。食糧團體在米市場中，原限定最高白米價格，每存石十四元，且制定限價以上的交易為無效，更釐　罰則；但是事實上，都在限價外作　盤交易。限價委會旣沒有執行共統制權力於前，又不能因勢利導，或嚴厲依　懲辦於後；以致漲風一起，遂漫無已時。</p>
<p>第二：某方的壟斷和　斂的加重。加重了運米來滬的成本。此與其他各類土產物如蠶荳等同一情形。</p>
<p>第三：市塲人心的慌張；天津事件發生後，某方　揚言欲加某種舉　於　市；人心不免衝動，乃相率購米，促市價激漲的機運。</p>
<p>第四：投機家的操縱。這與其他貨物上的投機相同；米為居民生活必需品，更易為彼輩利用。這决米價的繼漲增進，不無受其所賜。</p>
<p>米價致漲的原因如此，試為抑平之道進一言。</p>
<p>第一：規定標準價格，並切實嚴厲執行。限價的訂立，雖屬消極，但目下沒有較此更有效的方策，不過在訂定此限價以前，對於內地米價以及運費諸點，皆須為計及，免使商人再行藉口。</p>
<p>第二：米業團體和兩租界當局，應切實嚴峻監督。對違法者應繩之以法；米業團體，更應與租界當局取密切聯絡。</p>
<p>第三：亦當注意到來源的暢旺。上海擁有四百多萬食口，但本身並不產米，皆仰給於蘇常崑錫蕪湖等一帶運滬供應。因此，來源的打開，關係相當重要。</p>
<p>第四：辦理登記，澈查囤戶，並强制其出賣，。</p>

<h3>關於銅輔幣問題</h3>
<p>— 陳寳鎔</p>
<p>中國財政部鑒於海外銅價飛漲，早已嚴禁銅元私運出口在案，上海因地屬淪陷區域，為政府權力所不及；江海關迫於環境，亦無法執行命令，某方又蓄意擾亂金融破壞幣政，以冀達到影響抗戰實力之目的，故不惜抬高價格收集銅幣，先時收買銅質較厚成色最高之大淸光緒銅元，繼及民國旅銅元及一分之新輔幣，聞舊銅元二百五十枚，値國幣三元；新輔幣一百枚，値國幣一元二角至二元，一般奸商，唯利是圖，不斷向市塲鉅額搜羅，先運至虹口，而後由某方裝輸出口，據云每年私運出口者，常達五千萬元之鉅，中央銀行迫不獲已，故近來已中止將新輔幣運滬接濟。故本埠銅幣之缺乏，由來已久。惟一般民間尙未充分發覺耳。最近因上海電車汽車公司張貼佈吿，傳出銅幣缺乏之消息後，居民始相驚伯有，向不窖藏者，今亦奇貨可居，市上之銅幣於是造成完全絕跡之現象。</p>
<p>銅元缺乏之結果，一般另星交易，幾皆陷於不可能之境，而以平民階層所受之影響為允甚，因有一部份商店皆化零為整，作變相之加價，一如原値七八分之日用商品，即漲價至一角，名義上為省免另找，實際上乃趁火打刦。不僅此也，一般商店，復多自行發行私票。即在大小不一之空白紙上，甚至日曆廢頁之反面，任意書寫數額，加蓋號章，代用銅兀。然因僅限用於一店，範圍太狹，流通不廣。新閘路等市聯分會，現已發行聯合代價券，此雖屬權宜之計，未可厚非，但究為非法舉動，縱有相當準備，但無有嚴正之監督機關：且粗製濫造，易被奸宄仿印朦混，滋生流弊。故中央會有電令來滬，對此自行印製代價券一節，認為有碍整個金融市塲，不准發行。惟英法吻租界公共汽車電車公司，為業務上之必要，現巳完全使用代幣券。法租界電車所用者，有一分二分兩種，係用卡紙製成，中英文對照。於六月十八日發行，訂明八月底以前為有效期。公共租界英商電車公司雖不拒用郵票印花，惟亦於同日起發行代幣券二分三分兩種，係用薄卡紙印成，亦有中英文說明。該公司規定，此項代幣券除在車上通用外，並得向蘇州路一八五號該公司辦事處兌現。</p>
<p>至於全市各業之零數交易，成為目前唯一之通用籌碼者，厥為郵票與印花。尤以郵票為大宗，而印花稅票尙佔少數。比重措施，頗為合法，市塲上因此消弭不少因銅幣缺乏而發生之糾粉。惟携藏較難，且易沾汚，究不稱便。然於當局尙未頒布正式補救辦法以前，亦未始非救急之一法。用郵票印花代幣，不自今日始，可稱為一古巳有之，世界通行」。在國外且有專供錢幣使用而發行之郵票。</p>
<p>因郵票為國家發行郵資之替代物，錢幣亦為國定之商業媒介品。錢幣缺乏時，用郵票以代之，在理論上確是最為合理。平時各大公司，凡設有郵購部者，亦有以郵票代幣購貨之事，允以文化業最為通用。</p>
<p>當德意志聯邦帝國尙未成立以前，北部與南路諸邦均單獨發行郵票。此種郵票之圖案，在中間有一明晰之亞拉伯數字，其背景繪以極精緻之網紋，即用以兌換錢幣，效用與鈔票無異。後因普魯士日臻强盛，始為普魯士郵票所代替，今已成為不常見之德國古票矣。</p>
<p>美國在南北戰爭之初期，因貨幣缺乏，亦曾用郵票代幣，以濟一時之急。</p>
<p>一九一四年歐洲大戰爆發，俄國首先捲入漩　，亦因錢幣缺乏，會於决年發行十戈比，十五戈比與二十戈比郵票各一種，以代貨幣。並為顧及實用上之便利，印此種郵票於薄硬紙上，背面不塗膠水。且印有俄文一句，其意謂」此票等於同數價値之銀幣」。</p>
<p>全市各業，今以郵票為營業上之零找，日久漸不以為怪，恐慌情勢，故已不若初時之　重。前傳中央銀行將由昆明運送新鑄銅鎳輔幣來滬接濟，不日可運抵上海云云。如果：則新鑄銅幣一達滬市，即將與以前在滬之銅幣，遭遇同樣命運，不翼而飛。中央豈一愚至此。</p>
<p>郵票雖為臨時合法之通用籌碼。但謀一勞永逸計，尙盼財部明令國家銀行，尅日發行轉幣劵為是。或援引浙江地方銀行前例，賦與上海銀行業聯合貯備庫發行此項分幣劵之權若干時。設延不解決，則如私人等發行之非法代價劵之類，恐有破壞現行幣制完整之虞也。</p>
<h3>再度限制提存辦法</h3>
<p>— 林岳生</p>
<p>要瞭解這决財部對上海法幣存戶限止提存的措施，首先不能不先明暸本月七日香港中英滙兌平準基金委員會停止供給上海黑市外匯的原委：</p>
<p>上海黑市外滙的存在，原與我國策相抵觸的；中央銀行早已奉令實行外匯統制請核辦法，關閉了非法資金逃避的道路。而外滙黑市，不僅足為非法資金外逃的門路，且為偽幣售買我法幣外滙的源泉；一因上海是一個條的口岸，二則政府在上海的政權行施，目前已遭受了種種限制；要消滅外匯黑市，非與各友邦通力合作，是近乎不可能辦到的，目前各友邦與我合作的程度，顯見日趨密切，日見接近與我國策相符的外滙統制原則了，本月七日香港中英滙兌平準委員會停止供給上海黑市外滙就是合作之一例，此種措施的理由：不外抑制上海無限制的巨額入超，與防以日偽幣套買我外滙，本刋已屢有論述，茲不復贅，故此决對外滙的新措施，是站在自動的經濟防禦陣地上的必要手段；絕非一般淺近眼允者認為幣制變動的先聲。</p>
<p>現在再進而檢討外滙　縮後上海市面的影響：首先是純粹外貨物價的的漲，逐後半國貨性貨物亦跟蹤上漲，最後竟至純粹國產貨也乘機上漲，且其漲勢竟並不因國貨外貨而有所區別，更不因奢侈品日用品而相異。如米價在六月六日常熟白粳猶祇須售十七元二角一担，相隔祇十餘天，竟已漲至二十二元上下，究其原因：來源到貨皆旺，存底亦豐，雖天津事件，民間不無起些微屯藏行為，但主要原因，尙在市面上的浮資，流向屯貨居奇之一途所致，這些握有大批浮資的人們，正想乘外匯縮價之際，來一下混水裏撈魚的勾當。</p>
<p>從上所述：可知這次外滙暴縮，是政府有意提高外貨奢侈品的價格，來制止人民的浪費。同時不願必需品日用品因之增漲，而增加民困的，但在上海，因政治力的脫節，致使政府原本盡善盡美的政策，被一般利令智昏的奸商所利用：政府為打擊這些奸商起見，乃有再度限制提存的此决決定了。</p>
<p>財部馬電，大意是限制法幣存戶每週五百元以上之支付；超額部分，祇能以同業匯劃支付。但資金匯入內地，並不受此限制。每週有五百元法幣的支付，即一個月有二千元法幣可資運用；道不僅對一般中下級存戶生活絕無影響，即一般店鋪，亦不致有任何不便，所不便者。。惟浮資存額巨大的投機商而已。故其打擊的是投機商的野心，並非它們所有的財富。換一句話說：如果它們把資金運用到正途上去，如果它們去追求正當的利潤，那末途徑是非常廣大的。這一措施的實行，無疑的可以去安定物價，從而供一般薪給階級得鬆一口氣。</p>
<p>試看財部馬電實行後，金價暗盤已下降一百餘元：美元放長一元六二五；英匯長到七辦士，保證物價上漲的外匯已不縮而猛長了，難道物價還有上漲的理由麼？難道奸商們還能亂用其游資作惡的餘地麼？這一個賢明的措施，不僅可以打擊奸商們屯屯貨居廳的野心，同時也是防止民族資金逃避的一個好辦法。</p>
<h3>中日貨幣戰之回顧與展望（續）</h3>
<p>— 安石</p>
<p>四，最近華中貨幣戰的激烈和日本的失敗</p>
<p>法幣旣毫無自行崩潰之現象，而日本「友邦」人士之不惜「愛護」，又徒使法幣地位日見增高。於是無法，最近乃有主張一新通貨制定論」者，他們以為法幣不過是一種不換紙幣管理通貨，然其所以至今華中人民對此尙信任不衰者，實由於華中無足以代替法幣流通之薪通貨故也。</p>
<p>可是要發行新通貨以代替法幣，談何容易？法幣不僅可以套買外滙，且毫無膨脹的傾向，較之不能套買外滙而且惡性膨脹又正在進行中之日圓集團系之任何紗票，高出數百倍。所以欲打倒法幣，所發行的新通貨就非具有實在的價値或可直接兌換外匯不可。可是這也不是一件容易的事，對此日本學者政治家亦有各種不同的主張：</p>
<p>銀貨復活論</p>
<p>最初，彼等着眼於法幣之不能兌換銀兀一點，而主張銀貨復活論。蓋因銀歸國有而中國有一大批的私銀退藏於民間，據一部分日本學者所統計，法幣制度實施前中國蓄　有二十八萬五千萬元的白銀，，法幣實施時的有十萬萬兀由國民政府輸出海外，故現尙有十八萬五千萬元之白銀存於中國。此外，日本所退藏之銀亦有相當數目。以此二者為基礎，先以其一部分在華中發行銀貨，則中國內地所退藏的白銀亦必隨之百出現於市面，此一方面旣是以驅逐不兌現之法幣，另一方面復可以討好美國，蓋此舉對於美國銀政策頗有益處也云。</p>
<p>可惜這種自由算盤又失敗了。</p>
<p>第一，目前中國內地所始祖藏之銀，恐未必有如是之多，日本學者間，有估價為僅五萬萬元左右者。</p>
<p>第二，淪區之退藏銀，大部分早為日人掘運無遺，何來此大批存銀。</p>
<p>第三，淪區之日軍勢力，僅點和綫，對於廣大游擊區，日人是無法使退藏的銀出現於社會上的。</p>
<p>第四，即使銀貨流通了，可是退藏白銀在短暫時間也絕對無法使其出現於市面。上决世界大戰當時中國白銀因流出過多而金融大都市之現銀奇缺，利息暴漲異常，可是中國內地的退藏白銀並不因此而立即流出，經過了一二年之久，才出現市面：此其一證。何况當此戰亂之際，流出更加沒有可能。</p>
<p>第五，加之華中國際關係複雜異常，難保不無流出之虞，若加以嚴厲强固的統制而禁止其流出，復足以影響及銀貨本身的價倘與效果</p>
<p>第六，至於欲藉此討好美國，所出代價未免過小。</p>
<p>第七，最後，應當注意者，華中銀貨復活政策如果成功，則被驅逐者，不僅法幣，日幣和軍票亦在其列，而加速日本本國通貨膨脹的惡性化。（未完）</p>
<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>呢絨業的內銷</h3>
<p>— 唐駿</p>
<p>海無疑地在我們全國中，是個商業中心區，無論是出口或是進口，大都經過了這裏後，大批地把我們的國產原料貨品等，運向外洋去，或是打從外洋定下了大批的貨品，然後再運銷到國內其他商埠去，所以我們說上海的商業，也就是我們全國工商業的樞紐，那該是不錯的。</p>
<p>呢絨業在上海，自然也　算是我們全國呢絨業的樞紐區了！在幾十年來從上海呢絨業的行銷狀况上看，就可得到證明。在過去，多數的呢絨行號，不僅僅是供應了本市的消費者的需要，他同時調節了國內其他許多商埠的需求，因此在好些呢絨行號的全年營業數字中，外埠的交易，要佔其一半；當淡交通與運輸方面便利的時候，且會超過這個比例的。行銷的區域，在礦北有北平。天津·靑島·大連·烟台·濟南·等等；九一八前，遼寗如瀋陽·營口等處，也有走銷的；在華中華南方面，更是廣闊異常，諸如漢口·長沙·南京·蘇州·杭州·桂林·南昌·廣州·汕顯等處，每年交易都稱忙碌，而如天津·北平·靑島·漢口等地，每年銷行允巨。「一二八」的戰爭，曾給予了外埠的走銷方面以很大的打擊！那時不僅僅以呢絨業為然，其他如五金棉紗等等，又何嘗不遭遇着了相同的境况！但那時因為戰事不久就吿結束，所以不久後，呢絨業和其他的行業一般，仍恢復了外埠的行銷，在情况上，倒也不會怎樣的低落。</p>
<p>但終於「八一三」全面抗戰，突在上海爆發了！當時呢絨業正是個冬的生意季節，平津雖已在緊張的狀態中，但如靑漢的客人，正紛紛蒞臨配貨，至此又不得不暫停進貨；跟着戰事的激烈進展，於九月初，呢絨業連本市的走銷，也陷於停頓了！店員等亦有很多避戰返鄕。迨至十二月初，國軍撤離上海，呢絨業和其他業號一般，也才開始營業，外埠的行銷，這時乃吿絕跡，而郵局亦有很多處所，運輸不通；木市的銷行，也淸淡異常，在這一個時期中，呢絨業只可說是在維持着店面，大家是在驚魂甫定之後，整理其業務。　後一年，平津靑等處的津浦綫郵運恢復了，華北方面，才時常有些配貨；但不再像戰前有那麼成疋成箱的裝銷了，只是幾碼幾套等等而已；不過當時漢口武昌等處的行銷，突轉活躍：這是因為我們的全面戰爭已擴展至長江內圍綫去了，才造成了武漢的畸形繁榮局面，上海的呢絨行號，有好些會派人由寗波溫州轉道到武漢去「坐莊」，儘量供應春夏貨品，因此呢絨業在道時的內銷方面，幾已成為一面倒——武漢方面去了。　但終於在夏盡時節，武漢又告失陷了，武漢的走銷才又絕跡！</p>
<p>從此呢絨的內銷，才成為滯頓的狀態中；現在華北的郵運，差不多都吿恢復了，平津靑漢等處的客人，在今春也曾有少數來滬配貨；但數量已退至戰前的一半，武漢等處則以長江嚴加封鎖，運銷更遠不可期，他們都一致宣說，英美的貨銷，在華北長江，不久都將沒有地位了！這當然是受人排擠的必然結果，呢絨的內銷前途，當然也脫不了這個悲慘的遭遇吧！</p>

<h3>說文壇上的「謀略」</h3>
<p>— 吐老</p>
<p>最近其書店出版了一本專講訟師本領的書。我只從報上看見了廣吿，據說該書是「集訟師謀略之大成，足爲文學作家之一助」的。。</p>
<p>這看去很有些奇怪，所以我便忍不生想了一想。</p>
<p>講釗訟師，在過去的社會裏確是靠「謀略」過日子的階級。他們底謀略除了用在狀子上，即是用文字去作構陷，誣賴的工作以外，還甩在實際的計劃上。他們能買通官方，勾結流氓，假造證據，製造謠言，以及做其他更可怕的事。</p>
<p>不過那廣吿旣說是「足爲文學作家之一助」，當然那書所講的是只限於文字上的「謀略」的。關於這一面，從前也有過專書，但大抵並不說出「謀略」的要訣。這還是中國人底老毛病，甚麼都要「秘」一下纔合式。然而大體說來，那要訣却總不外兩種：第一是給人起綽號，第二是遇事講動機」。</p>
<p>綽號即是所謂諢名。那方法是；在未曾寫出所控吿的人底罪狀以前，先給那姓名上安一個綽號，如「巨眼太歲」「大頭覇王」之類，意思是讓官方一看那姓名，便先斷定他不是個好東西。「動機」是現代的話，從前的術語呌作「居心」。那方法是：若界所控吿的人有一兩件大家都知道的善事，便說他居心是爲了求名或求利，總之好處也是壞處，或者比容易看出的壞處還壞。在反吿的時候，是常用着這一手的。</p>
<p>不過現在耍問的是這些「謀略」到底對於「文學作家」有甚麽用處呢？——其實據我看來，那位編書的人實在是枉費心思，我們有些文學作家却早就學會了這些「謀略」了。</p>
<p>倘是不信，倒不妨去查查文壇上的舊賬和新賬。「綽號學」已經盛行過一個時期，「居心學」却一直盛行着，到現在還沒有衰歇。而最普遍的是當自己被人批評得走頭無路的時候，就忽然變成X光，說可以看見批評者底「動機」了。這用的便正是反吿的一手。</p>
<p>然而據經騐看來，這種訟師底文風，實在並不能有「助」於「文學作家」的。「綽號學」雖然盛行過，但結果却又消滅得沒有了影子。那原因便是：旣然掛了「文學作家」的招牌，總要顧一點「文的面子，不願意給對方起那種「巨限太歲」「大頭覇王」的綽號，而且事實上對方也是文學作家，決不能壞到「太歲」「覇王」上面去，所以起的綽號也只能限於「個人主義者」「悲觀主義者」之類。但這却實在太廣汎，受的人旣未曾感到打擊，聽的人也覺得平常得很，所以寫出來就完，效力是一點也得不到的。「居心學」維持得比較長久，但到底也還是不行。譬如　，一位作家在為自己辯護的時候，可以說批評自己的人是為了「所求不遂」「挾私報復」，這聽去似乎是動人的，可是事實上却很難引起第三者底注意。因爲旣是作家，主要的當然是文字，大家也只看批評者對你底文字批評得對不對，居心怎樣畢竟難以捉摸，實在用不着管這樣的鳥事。而且這話還會使自己失掉了體統，讀者會疑心你和批評者的性別不同，那位會經要求過你甚麼而沒有達到目的，纔來「報復」一下的。——這呌作自己給自己上當。</p>
<p>所以，訟師底文風儘管是高妙，文學作家却實在是得不到益處的。</p>
<p>至於文字以外的實際上的「謀略，我們有些文學作家好像也會經試騐過一下，但效力却也有限得很。理由很簡單：文壇畢竟不是衙門，弄來弄去，到頭總是被人拆穿完事。</p>
<p>能排絕訟師式的「謀略」，文學作家倒或者會有些希望。</p>
<h3>上前綫去</h3>
<p>— 凌雲龍</p>
<h3>燒赤鏈蛇（上）</h3>
<p>— 明枝</p>
<p>——老奶奶的故事——</p>
<p>由於錢阿森的通知，打麥塲上一時忙了起來。錢阿森說，咋夜李余根吿訴他的，「他們一在今天下鄕「搜索」，耍走過此地。</p>
<p>王　源隊長領着我們正在　着老奶奶家裏打麥，聽見了這消息，就召集我們商議應付之策。爲了「他們」的數目很多，有八九十個，於是我們按着習慣決定不和「他們」作正面衝突，暫時散到後面的秦山上去。</p>
<p>『好的，』老奶奶撩着額頭的汗說，『你們去，這裏一切有我。等他們來了去了，你們就可以下山回來了。』</p>
<p>『我們怎能知道「他們」的來去呢？』王隊長問。</p>
<p>你們只要看見此地塲上有烟起來，便是「他們」來；烟息，便是他們」去。』她又對她的兒子和媳婦說，『你們也去，只要阿明陪我就够了。』阿明是她的孫子。</p>
<p>在王隊長督率我們在屋子裹收拾的時候，老奶奶的一家和錢阿森都在將塲上的麥殼和斷麥桿畚到塲的西南角上去，堆了起來。</p>
<p>我們上山去，錢阿森也回靑鎭去，塲上就剩了老奶奶和阿明兩個人。</p>
<p>我們在山脚上放步哨，大部份的人則掩藏在山腰的樹林裏，大家都端正好了傢伙，準備「他們」衝上來。</p>
<p>李金根在離開王家村沒有多遠的地方，就碰到了「他們」，給「他們」盤問，搜索，並毆打之後，總算沒有別的意外。</p>
<p>老奶奶看見「他們」漸漸走入村中，就去將麥殼堆點着了火，由牠煨燒起來。似乎「他們」裏面有人發着命令，對於這一個小小的村落，也要　盡「他們」所以下鄉的責任。於是有一小部份人進入屋子去「搜索」，大部份人便在樹下坐下來歇着。</p>
<p>『喂，老婆子，』他們　裏面一個穿着白布短衫褲的人喊着老奶奶，『你過來，我耍問你。』</p>
<p>老奶手裏拖着一柄連枷，走了過去，阿明跟在她的後面。他們都顯着坦然的樣子，便是有人進入他們的屋子，似乎也不値得他們的注意。</p>
<p>『什麽事？』老奶奶將衣角揩着汗。</p>
<p>『你們這裏可有允吉隊？』</p>
<p>『「油鹽豆」家家會炒的。』</p>
<p>『不是什麼「豆」。問你這裏可有土匪」。』</p>
<p>『道裏從來沒有土匪，只有外面來的强盜。』</p>
<p>『强盜在那裹？』</p>
<p>『他們並不住在這裏，一來就去的。』</p>
<p>『他們搶些什麽？』</p>
<p>『看見什麽就什麼，連人也要的。』</p>
<p>她和那人胡扯了一陣，看看沒有什麽事，就又去打麥。</p>
<p>進屋子去「搜查」的人沒有出來，叉跟了幾個人進去。那個穿白布短衫褲的人，似乎有些無聊，便立了起來張望着。一眼看見了在煨燒着的麥殻堆，就又喊着奶奶說：</p>
<p>『喂老婆子，你過來，我還要問你。』</p>
<p>老奶奶只作不聽見，不理他。</p>
<p>『喂，老婆子，那裏燒些什麽呢？』他走了過去，神氣似乎和善些。</p>
<p>老奶奶大聲說：『那裏燒的赤鏈蛇！』</p>
<p>『赤鏈蛇？那裏來的赤鏈蛇？』分明要找些話說說。</p>
<p>不曉得什麼地方來的赤鏈蛇！』老奶奶拄下了連枷說　『可是總不是本地的，因爲本地素來沒有，近來才發見的。』</p>
<p>『大麽？』顯然和一般人那樣，都很喜歡談蛇。</p>
<p>『怎麼不大；大的像臂膊，小的像指頭。』</p>
<p>『多麽？』</p>
<p>『怎麼不多；多時幾十條，少時一二條，時常有得來。據說有的地方還整千整千的發見呢！』</p>
<p>『有沒有人被咬死？』</p>
<h3>印象的旅遊（續）</h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>小和尙照會我們喝了茶，喫了些粥，又借了三件夾袈裟披了。早晨的確冷，風又大，東方一帶還祗帶點銀白色。</p>
<p>沿着再朝上的路，的百來步，再轉　東進，我發現一個略有些點綴和建築的平臺，直迎着東邊的山嶺。我們走到上面，裹緊袈裟，在石亭子問裏蜷縮着，等朝霞的出現。</p>
<p>這眞是一種毫無意味的，雅士們無聊賴的工作。也許朝陽出山的景象中，會要擁出一個神仙來，向他們灑幾滴仙露罷？我先是被這驚異的鼓動所惑，到山上來，馬上發現事件的平凡，——在我們的故鄉……芙蓉寨，九峯塞，斑竹墺，曉霞山等小小範圍，都可領略同一類的景象。略不同的，南嶽較高，露較濃厚，因爲景物被霧　罩，霞　反較爲覺得幻異，朝暾的周圍，較爲覺得混沌神秘些罷了。這不算奇特。不過作爲不出都門的紳七淑女的驚險對象一說法，的略可通罷了。</p>
<p>我勸兩彭不再留戀。下臺來，就近到矗立在極峯的聖帝廟一看。</p>
<p>聚帝廟是冷靜不堪的一所孤立的石房，建在一堆成疊的巨石上。柱是石的，地面是石的，牆壁也是石的，差不連裹面唯一的一個和尙也冷爭無生氣到和石一樣。他不打禪，也不唸經，也不照顧客人，祇是默默的坐在門旁，呆看在地上，手裏摟着木珠子。</p>
<p>十</p>
<p>我們是由西馬路回到山下的。</p>
<p>路經過藏經殿，費了半小時盜留，和一個湖北籍的僧人談了些閒話，經殿的建築還新，陳列的書籍也是近年來的版本，可是沒有一個明經的，湖北僧人自稱爲「養養性」，原來是速釋迦的生期和歷中也不明白的。</p>
<p>經過麼鏡台，我們發現附近有所空房子，據路人指點說是張學良幽居的地所。門口站着幾人帶盒子砲的，召示我們此地不能進去。</p>
<p>以决經過的是些林木頗盛的山地，有些寺院，別居，學校，我們因爲趕下午一時的車，不一再停留。忽忽的，和這篇記事一樣，結束了。我不願意抄錄，拘版地記述什麼，我祇須說出這短短的一些印象。（完）</p>
<h3>我要醒</h3>
<p>— 俊伯</p>
<p>我是孤獨的，我每天生活在孤獨的夢裹。慣用思想的筆，描出一幅美麗的圖畫。</p>
<p>夢是我熟悉的同伴，我不曾在夢裹有一回失意。當覺得愁悵的時候，或者有一點沈鬱，那麽，我就把呼吸緊鎖在酣夢的深谷，靜待那一只溫郁的手，抹掉我心上的一片秋。</p>
<p>夢時寂寞的，我做過許多寂寞的夢。有時感到痛苦後的疲倦，那我不妨就飲一杯寂寞的酒。看着簷頭的水滴；傾聽微細的風掠過庭園的楓尖；我開始遙想許多金色的故事，接着就跌入了寂寞的夢中。我看見自已的影子伴着昔日的歡笑；也許我還摸到失去了的溫暖。沒有咒詛；不是怨恨；緊握着記憶的夢，夢裏有寂寞的歡喜。</p>
<p>向着蒼茫的天涯，呼喚旣逝的年華。心是沈痛的。無意招一招手，借着天雁的翅膀，我又摸索飛向夢中的道路了。「夢中無歲月」，我又寂寞地笑了。笑是孤獨的，有誰伴涪它呢？除了那簷頭的水滴，庭院裏微細的風。</p>
<p>於是，我痛苦得哭了。被夢淫亂過的心又驟而冰冷了。揉一揉眼，我說：「夢是空的，那還不是一塲虛渺的變幻？」</p>
<p>伸手抱着遼闊的世界，我不想再做夢了。夢後的惆悵够將我折磨。趕快趁這現實的烽火，打起一身壯健的精神，沐浴在時代的風雨中。</p>
<p>眞的，我要醒，再也不去追求那金色的謊了！</p>

<h3>我們應注意整個社會的衛生</h3>
<p>— 袁鶴松</p>
<p>暑天到了，暑天是時疫流行的季節。</p>
<p>往年，一到暑天，上海的時疫總是猖獗得使幾處時疫醫院忙得不可開交；而現在，因為大兵之後，而且狹小的租界中人口激增，所以時疫及其他疾病一定要較往年更猖獗，這是可以預料得到的。</p>
<p>時疫及其她疾病的惡魔當然不分階級，無論貧富，牠一樣會去侵擾的；然而，事實上，富有階級患時疫者總比貧苦階級者少，其原因是爲了富有階級終可講究些衛生，住的寬敞，吃的乾淨，病魔便沒有機會侵入；而貧苦階級，住的那麼擁擠，吃的但求一飽，物質條件把他們限制了，要講究衛生也無從講起，因此病魔便時常有機會去侵入。可是，在目前的孤島上，生活程度一天一天在高漲，貧苦的人維持生活已經感到為難，不幸而患了病，有什麽餘錢去醫治呢？所以，救濟協會和各團體的熱心人士，本仁愛濟世之心，發動勸募衛生經費，俾得救濟一般無力担負醫藥費的病患者，確是迫切需要的一件有意義的工作。</p>
<p>有能力的人拿出錢來做救濟的慈善事業，大家知道是一件利人濟世的仁義之舉，所以在此時期，大家應該快些慷慨解囊，共襄盛舉；然而，我以為，我們在能力拿出錢做救濟事業，不但是利人，也就是利己，我可以舉一個例子來談談。</p>
<p>有一個留學生，他留學回國以後，學得一付十足的洋派，非常講究衛生，他住在城市裏以為空氣不及近郊好，所以在近郊建築了一座洋房，洋房的構造不但精緻而處處顧到衛生的設備，四週有窗戶，裝好紗窗，有拉水馬桶，洋磁浴缸，四週有陰溝，時常洒用臭藥水等，然而，他後來也病了，家裏的人也時常生病，這原因因為他這洋房和他一家人是講究衛生了，可是在他四圍的人家沒有講究衛生，田野裏，人家的灌溉，糞臭也會得無情的佈滿了他的洋房裏，微生蟲，紗窗也閣不住他們的侵入的緣故。</p>
<p>從這個例子裏，我們可以看到環境沒有弄好，獨善其身是沒有用的，我們應先把整個的社會注意到衛生，才能使自己不受到影響，所以俗語有句話：「救人卽自救」。因此，我們除了本仁慈之心，有錢者出錢，來從事這救濟的事業；我們更應明瞭，救人即自救，而更慷慨地捐輸，來對付這時疫流行的季節，使這時疫流行的季節平安的過去，謀得整個的孤島人士來安渡這危險的季節！</p>
<h3>動機與目的</h3>
<p>— 奚玉書</p>
<p>上海人為中國之第一商埠，人口稠密，自戰事以來，因戰區擴大，四方來滬避難者絡繹不絕，人口陡增，僅法租界與公共租界中區及西區之數方公里中集居至四百五十萬之多，實開世界各都市人口密度之空前紀錄。平時每日死亡在二百五十人以上，故殯儀館之設立雖如雨後春筍，然仍不敷分配，至於病者，數更可驚，觀乎各醫院之人滿，可知其大槪矣。茲夏令已屆，如許人口，若不早為之計，一旦疫症流行，病者將求醫無門，死亡固必增加，傳染更難防止，若遇烈性疫症，日死數千，決非意外之事，其可懼為何如！上海難民救濟協會有鑒於斯，特勸募衛生經費，以便添置醫藥醫具，廣設診所，收預防與醫療之效，獲減少死亡之果，以保難民之衛生，兼策居民之安全，實一應時之急務，想滬上不乏仁德君子，對此善舉，當必踴躍贊助也。</p>

<h3>為難胞衛生捐款者進一言</h3>
<p>— 葉春華</p>
<p>蘆溝橋事變後，本市個慈善團體即紛起組織難胞救護機關，旋以　地局勢日趨緊張，為集中救濟力量，統一辦事機關起見各善團即聯合組上海市救濟委員會，先假仁濟堂，繼遷浦東大樓，辦理一切救濟事宜，最初成立難民收容所五處，收容難胞五百餘人，其後戰區逐漸擴大，難胞亦日益增加，於是各學校各遊戲塲各機關各廟字，亦幾盡為收容之所，惟難胞人數竟多至數十萬以上，以致仍有容積不下之勢，乃設法將一部份遺散回鄉。</p>
<p>過去關於難胞之衛生問題，起初不過在各收容所，設醫藥組，發見疾病，輕者聘義務醫師為之診治，重者則送難民醫院醫治，同時檢查難胞體格以防疾病之傳染，而兩相界衛生處亦復委派醫生至各收容所為難胞種痘，及注射防疫針，俏有因病致死者，則另出掩　組棺殮掩埋，要之，對難胞養生送死之事，本市各慈善家已　於整個社會同舟共濟之必要，勉力行之矣。</p>
<p>近者難民救濟協會，又有勸募衛生經費委員會之設立，旨在勸募衛生費五萬元至十萬元，目前滬上居民達四百餘萬，此區區之數，當不難立致，仁者解囊，動機於人道，吾知此舉之必能早觀厥成也。</p>
<p>七萬餘難胞，人數不可謂不多，萬一疫癘發生傳染大衆，豈是滬人之幸，故與其將來焦頭爛額，毋寗羣策羣力，自利利人，滬地不乏仁人，尙望登高一呼，成此義舉，豈獨七萬以上難胞之幸，亦四百餘萬市民之福耳。</p>

<h3>閘北三小時巡禮</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>位於上海外國租界的視綫以內，曾經密集百萬人口，而現在却滿播着焦木頹垣的閘北，是在前年華軍棄守上海區前數天十月二十七號陷落的。屈指一數，日方佔據該地已有十九個月，論理，大可實行它野心勃勃而盡力宜傳的改良市政和經濟開發的計劃了。</p>
<p>距今幾天前，我回到閘北盤桓了數小時，所入眼簾的景象，比我在前年一個陰霾的冬日，最後一决到閘北所見到的，還要令人沮喪。那時候，公共租界被日軍侵佔的部份和閘北，幾乎看不出有什麽不同之處，因爲這兩區都是一片荒凉，瀰漫着死的氣息；現在呢，公共租界喧囂的熱鬧，和閘北死一般的沉寂，却成了尖銳的對照。</p>
<p>在閘北失陷以後的十九僩月裏，日方並沒有着手來改變它彈痕纍纍的面目，當時的砲彈窟窿依然點綴着瓦礫遍地的街道，被機關槍火射得像蜂窠一般的牆壁，還竪立在路旁，搖搖欲傾。華軍的堡壘還存在着，只是沙袋業已稍壞，從裏面窺過半掩的店門可以直瞧到街上。</p>
<p>商務印書館價値百萬元的工塲，一垜牆向着鄰近的壕溝外傾，工塲四週，被有刺鐵絲網包圍着，面前的坦克車大陷穽却已塡平，以便軍用卡車偶而駛過。兩年前，商業繁熒，行人擁擠的寶山路，呌人見到便想起鬼市來，不過鬼市的邊道上沒有彈穴而已。</p>
<p>五年裏被日本侵略者兩决摧毀的北火車站，已重新造成，但外國人的眼睛，不能窺察它的神秘，因爲現在它的四週已造起水泥高牆，通電流的鐵柵，和有刺鐵絲網的障礙物。朝着公共租界，還有一座簇新的水泥地下堡，那是預防不測之用的。出入北站只留一個門口，站着板着臉見的日本憲兵，仔細注視着驚慌慌地乘火車的華人。</p>
<p>我回想到前年十月裏，從界路租界方面的破屋子裹，向一百碼外北站看去，只見日機懶散地在北站天空盤旋着，擲下巨大的炸彈，下面是戴圓錐草帽的中國士兵，也許是新從廣西開到的援軍，因爲相距很近，我能看出他們每一個臉上的特點；飛機每投一彈，他們便平伏地上，一霎那間，砰的一聲，震耳欲聾，木片和塵土接着飛揚起來，這些士兵在炸彈轟發後，便立刻安詳地繼續他們的職務，好像沒事一般。</p>
<p>現在，只附近兩路大厦裏的日本水兵，偶爾嗄然發出吆喝聲，和公共租界裏電車的鈴聲，衝破了死一般的沉寂。一九三五到三六年造成的兩路大厦本身，還巍巍屹立着，二樓和三樓上，已配上窗櫺，改成日水兵的兵營，這所建築物也有高栅環繞，哨兵守着大門。除此以外，日方對這幢房屋，聽其自然。灰牆上還有四邊焦黑的窟窿，被日軍陸海空軍密集轟擊三個月，受震而鬆動的磚塊，還沒除去，有幾處還可看見殘垣中的鋼筋。</p>
<p>兩路大厦周圍的木質建築物，在日機轟炸時，首當其衝，剩下的木材，正有受日方監督的華籍苦力，一羣在拆除着。我在閘北全區，只見到三羣苦力，內有一羣正在拆除一所半毀的敎堂，把磚塊整齊地堆積起來，也許是用來建築日方所要造的房屋。除了這幾批苦力，和一輛公共汽車裏的華人，在實山路實興路口向日哨兵搖動着通行設之外，我在閘北三小時，所見到的華人不滿二十個。</p>
<p>然而閘北的華人居民雖已减少，並沒絕跡，每一條要道上，允其是在寶興路上，每隔五十碼站立着一個愼防着的哨兵，從樹後，屋角和障礙物裏，悄悄地窺視着經過的每個人和車輛。橋上，有一小隊巡遷水兵，仔細查看幾個過橋的農民的通行證。被佔巳經十九個月的閘北，爲何還這般嚴密戒備得像一座武裝營。因爲閘北是進租界裏日本軍事根據地的前門麼？或是爲了恐怕海外週知的游擊隊襲擊麼？這是不難明瞭。</p>
<p>假使日方有開始經濟復興的資金和機會，那末，上海「小東京」的閘北，當然是這種計劃的理想地，距離閘北一哩以內，便有港口，日本能在那裏源源運進建設材料：在上海本身，有着盈千纍萬的勞工，找尋工作，還有許多人，渴望回到他們生長的故鄕。在「小東京」，有着無眼制的管理能力，和技術智識的供給，再，日本在整個上海區裏，集中着大批陸海軍士兵，飛機和軍艦，大足保護閘北，不被華軍襲擊。</p>
<p>那末，日本還不開始它盡力宣傳的計劃叉將怎樣解釋呢？這答覆劉於日本在華的整個經濟和政治活動，便是日本現在發覺，征服和綏靖中國的「神聖使命」，巳不是它的能力所可及了。</p>
<p>將近兩年前，日本開始目前的戰爭時，它本來的計劃是藉炫耀它的軍力而加强它在華北的勢力，但死命奮鬥的中國巳接應了日本的挑戰，於是戰事便蔓延到上海，一事變一便釀成了大戰，這眞是日本的不幸。戰事旣已擴大，日木所需的經費有增無减，到今天，它的總數大的已等於日本全國的全部歲收；同時，所能得到的資金，都被重工業吸收，兩年前可供華北經濟開發的資金現己用盡，空無所有，因此，不得不少發像東京暗示已擬定華北經濟計劃等等的驚人消息了。</p>
<p>還有比此更重要的，那是不得到居住在所謂「佔領區」裏的一萬萬以上華人的合作，無論那種復興都是不可能的。不幸的日本，它的軍隊至今沒有博得廣大羣衆的好感，日軍繼續進行可怕的戰事，使中國對侵佔者的痛恨，日增新的力量，這可用游擊戰的日見廣泛和日軍調出的有增無已，至今還高呼着「綏靖佔領區」種種事實來證明的。唉！叢爾殘破的閘北，巳足使日本覺悟從事侵略，等於徒勞，而且是未來悲慘後果的惡兆哩！（譯自大陸報星期雜誌）</p>

<p>自國軍在淞滬撤退之後，上海就形成了一個所謂「孤島一，許多職業界的靑年，要想在這一個咫尺彈丸的地方上，這一個特殊的環境之中，求一個正當的調劑身心的處所，的確很難很難；戰前的那些民衆團體，由於戰事的音響，太平都停頓了或渙散；於是意志薄弱的人，就被無聊的消遣昏迷了，終日終夜只在歌台舞榭間玩着，混着以消磨辰光的，眞是大有人在。當時，有盧馥·張元甫·梁决漁等諸位先生，都感到在這種情况之下，確有組織一個業餘的正當娛樂團體的需要；遂經過數度的籌劃與準備，最後就產生了這個「華聯同樂會」。其主旨，就是聯絡感情，研究學術，修養身心，改善生活，提倡正當娛樂，與推行福利事業。</p>
<p>「華聯會」在創始至今短短的一年歷史中，共間也遭遇到無數决的困難，然而，它肯努力，它肯奮鬥，所以終於使他渡過一切在風駭浪；會員由一百多人，而二千多人，而四千多人，會所由一間廂房，而九江路利昌商行的三樓，而至南京路一九四號，每一個時刻，它差不多就在進步，擴展，到了現在，在社會上的一般人仕間，允其是在「洋行」圈裏，有不知道「華聯會」這三個字的，恐怕已經很少。</p>
<p>在事實上，「華聯會」正是一個職業界青年的上好的業餘娛樂塲所，你在做完了一天的枯燥的工作之後，心中覺得有些疲倦與厭氣嗎？這時候，你就可以跑到「華聯會」的娛樂部裏去消遣。它共分國樂，粵樂，聲樂，口琴，奕棋，魔術，話劇，平劇等八門。你想增進些智學識嗎？「華聯會」也有一個學術部設立着，共下除了有一個圖書館，以及一星期學術講座」，「生活座談，一文藝講座」……等開辦着外，它還有一個華聯業餘補習學校」附設在福煦路的正行女中內。你要想鍜鍊鍜鍊身體的話，「華聯會」也有體育部，乓乒，排球，籃球與各項運動都已包羅得有，過去就因爲塲地的未會獲得解決，體育部的工作，顯示得不十分緊張，但近來，它的情况，則又是萬分的活躍了。總括的一句話，我們可以說，「華聯會」的目的，不但要使我們革除不良的習慣，廢止各種虛糜的俗氣，並且還要儘量地使我們得到增進學識，鍜鍊身心的機會。</p>
<p>順便在這裏「華聯會」還有三件事，値得我們來提一提，就是（一）婦女部的設立。在上海的多數團體裏，有婦女來參加活動的，眞是佔一個極少數，但「華聯會」的女會員，倒顯得特別的多，所以，就有這一個婦女部，來專門負起女會員的會務，它的工作在敎育方面，有烹飪研究班，生活常識班，在工藝方面則有縫紉，刺綉，編結等。（二）消費合作社的經營。在這一部下，除了有普通的飲食部，彈子室以外，「華聯會」還特的了許多商店，給予會員們以一種特別的購貨折扣與優待，以减輕各會員的生活的負擔。（三）救濟難民委員會的成立。爲了想來分負一些救濟難民的責任的緣故，「華聯會」就成立了這一個專門委會，來進行工作。</p>
<p>當然「華聯同樂會」還有許多壞處，沒有克服過來，不過在大概方面看來，「華聯同樂會」的工作，是値得我們來贊助的。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　勸學務農儲材爲國　留强汰弱選種有場</p>
<p>朱村長這一番話，好似訓話一般的，大家都恭聽着。後來又談到地皮的事，朱村長說：『我們這裏的地，只租不買。自從新村成立以來，所有全村土地，都　村有。倘然要用村中土地的，只能向村中租借，而不許購買。所有全村土地，都由村議會裏雇定價値，某一處，每一畝地，每年應收地租若干，都是規定了的。不過地也有好有壞，不能一致。聲如水陸交通便利的地方，自然佔價較高，僅通陸路而不通水路的，比較次一點，在山邊公路沒有築好的地方，當然又决一點。村事務所裏有一本冊子，把全村的地圖盡得詳詳細細。標明着某一處是最上等的，租價最高；某一處是中等的，租價决之；某一處是下等的，租價又决之。租地的期限，也不能一定，大概最長的是三十年，有二十五年的，有二十年的，最短的爲十五年，大槪以二十年爲最普通。不過因爲村治的進步，環境的發展，十年以後，得許重行估價，却是以公平爲基礎，並不有什麼偏見的。現在你們兩位小姐，到這裏來看一看，約略有個大概情形了。想來你們總是要一個水陸交通便利的地方的，你們大的要多少畝地？除了廠屋以外，還要建築別的附屬房屋與否？這也不能一天決定的，一面報吿你們尊翁，這裏的地址合宜與吾？一面就可以同一位建築師來看一看，便更覺周密了。』何雙玉道：『是的！依着我們兩人的意思，在道裏設廠，是再好也沒有了。想我父親也不反對，本來父親北行的時候，知道我們要來訪問愛人姊。就敎我們乘便到這裏，有什麽相當的地址，建築幾間屋子，足以棲身。因爲我們一時未必回到廣東去，而父親又嫌着上海那個市塲太喧囂了，於居家不甚相宜。但是叉爲着他的職業關係，又不能離七海過遠。所以我們最初曾經想和愛人姊商量，擇那山水淸華之區，嫌築個小別墅，覺得在　裏自由新村，最爲相宜。現在發起了這個綢廠計畫，中國絲織物的大本營，就在江浙兩省，而此地恰在江浙兩省之間。所以我想父親一定是很贊成的，其餘的股東，也是很願意的。』（一四六）</p>

<h3>The Result of Two-Pronged Counterattack by the Chinese Army: Recapture of Outposts Around Meixi; Shantou Becomes Ruins; A Unit of Valiant Soldiers Vows to Live or Die With the City; Fresh Chinese Troops Arrive in Northern Shantou, With a Commander Personally Overseeing the Front Lines; Japanese Troops Invade Northward Along the Chao-Shan Road, Fierce Fighting Erupts Near Caitang</h3>
<p>Chao'an: Since the 21st, when the Japanese launched a sea, land, and air assault on Shantou, they have been unable to advance deeply. On the 23rd and 24th, the Japanese army launched five-pronged attacks. On the Daji Road, Chinese troops are still confronting the Japanese army across the river in the Donghu'ao mountain area. Chinese troops on the Sijiwei front, after several days of fierce fighting and continuous bombardment by Japanese warships and aircraft, which completely destroyed their fortifications, have moved to Dafan (northwest of Sijiwei) to hold their ground. Fierce fighting between Japanese and Chinese troops is still ongoing. In Anbu (more than 30 li north of Shantou), a detachment of Japanese troops initially used more than 80 shallow-water vessels and small motorboats to invade with over 1,000 soldiers. After suffering a heavy defeat by Chinese troops, they reinforced with several hundred more and attacked Anbu again, briefly breaking through. On the 23rd, Chinese reinforcements rushed to the scene and counterattacked, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army, which retreated south of the iron bridge, now confronting Chinese troops across the river. Furthermore, Japanese troops in the Meixi area northeast of Anbu launched a fierce advance under heavy artillery cover. On the morning of the 24th, Chinese troops launched a two-pronged counterattack, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army retreated immediately, and all outposts around Meixi were recaptured by Chinese troops. Also, on the morning of the 22nd, three Japanese shallow-water vessels arrived off the coast of Tuopu Dongxi, northwest of Shantou, and shelled Tuopu to cover infantry landings, attempting to disrupt the Chinese army's left flank. To date, Chinese and Japanese troops are still engaged in fierce fighting. As for the Shantou city area, although the Chinese army is surrounded by Japanese troops on three sides, it is still able to fight tenaciously and is engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chao'an: Shantou has become a ruin after three days of bloody fighting and looting by Japanese soldiers and civilians. The Chinese army, finding no defensible positions left in the city, moved to Shanxi Beikoukou Mountain on the evening of the 23rd to establish contact with the Chinese troops in Anbu. A unit of valiant soldiers vowed to live or die with Shantou, making heroic sacrifices. Fresh Chinese troops have been arriving in northern Shantou and Koukou Qianqian, and a certain commander has personally gone to a certain location to supervise the fighting. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chao'an: The Japanese troops attacking Shantou, having suffered repeated defeats in Anbu and Meixi, have reinforced with cavalry and mechanized units and are invading northward along the Chao-Shan Railway. Fierce fighting has erupted with Chinese troops in Caitang, ten li west of Anbu. The Chinese had prepared for this in advance, and all soldiers deployed in their positions, showing extraordinary courage. The Japanese army has made no progress and is still locked in a stalemate in Caitang. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Since the start of the Lingdong war, most of the Japanese troops in Jiangmen and Huiyang have been withdrawn to Guangzhou, replaced by new troops and puppet army "pacification" units. Yesterday, Deng Longguang's forces took advantage of the situation to counterattack Jiangmen, engaging in fierce artillery battles on the Xinhui-Heshan road, killing many Japanese soldiers. Chinese troops from the Xinkai, Jiangmen, and Foshan roads are also advancing. (25th afternoon special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) On the morning of the 25th, twelve Japanese aircraft in four formations reconnoitered along the Shao-Shan highway. At noon, three aircraft flew over Jieyang and dropped two bombs on the Xi Chang. They then flew to Fuyang and dropped three bombs. Zhongshan is now intensifying wartime preparations, and the Qi-Guan highway is being destroyed in three sections. (25th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Front Lines in Northern Hunan: Stalled Warfare</h3>
<p>Miluo: The war on the entire front in northern Hunan has stalled. Chinese and Japanese forces remain in a standoff along a line more than ten li north of the Xinqiang River. (25th dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Envoy Flies to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, flew to Hong Kong on Saturday and is not expected to return here until approximately December of this year. Ambassador Cosme had originally planned to depart by plane on Friday, but had to turn back midway due to poor weather. Ambassador Cosme's stay here lasted only a week.

<h3>White Russian Demonstration and Parade in Tianjin; Food Supplies in Concessions Running Low; British Woman Also Subjected to Degrading Search; Mr. Smith Regains Freedom</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) This afternoon, five hundred White Russians in uniform, apparently under the direction of the Japanese, held a demonstration and parade in the First Special District. They all raised their hands in salute as they passed twenty Japanese officers. After the parade, the White Russian crowd gathered at the "White House" of the White Russian Anti-Communist Committee here. Representatives from Germany, Italy, and Spain attended the meeting, as did the chairman of the committee, Mr. Bertushin, White Russian leader Mr. Semenov, and Japanese officers. (25th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin dispatch: Of the two British warships docked at the British concession's wharves, one left Tianjin on the 23rd. However, vigilance in the British concession has not slackened. Patrol vehicles of the Municipal Council appear every few minutes in any part of the concession. Patrol vehicles of the British barracks also constantly patrol the area. The volunteer corps organized by British expatriates is actively training, with all members on standby. A reserve team is also being formed to provide reinforcements. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign dispatch: The British Consulate in Tianjin issued a communiqué stating that food supplies in the British concession are becoming increasingly difficult, and there is a severe shortage of milk, even insufficient for the needs of children. British authorities are currently seeking to use ships to transport food to provide relief. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Mr. Smith, a British expatriate who was detained by the Japanese on the 17th, was released by the Japanese this afternoon. According to Mr. Smith, when he was arrested, he was thrown into a small, extremely dirty and filthy room without a bed. He was not given any food for 24 hours. After repeated protests, he was taken to a cleaner location at the Chinese police station and allowed to buy his own food. On Thursday, after several interrogations, he was allowed to have Western food. The injury to his head was only treated once after he was detained. (25th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to today's news, on Saturday afternoon, at the Japanese sentry line at the Racecourse Road intersection, a German-born British woman, Mrs. Finland, was stripped of her clothes, almost completely naked, by puppet female police officers hired by the Japanese in front of Japanese sentries. The only garment left on was her underwear. At the same time, her husband, Mr. Finland (an employee of the Mercantile Bank), was publicly stripped naked in broad daylight, in front of men and women, by Japanese sentries until he was completely naked. This is the second time Mr. Finland has been stripped of his clothes. The previous stripping was on June 22nd, when, in addition to being stripped, he was also robbed of two five-yuan notes of legal tender. In addition to Mrs. Finland being stripped on Saturday, there were also reports that several Soviet women were also forced to remove their clothes. (25th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today is the twelfth day of the blockade of the concessions. The major events that have occurred include: (1) Mr. Smith, who was detained by the Japanese, has been released. (2) The supply of milk in the British concession has been completely cut off. (3) The White Russian Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps held a demonstration in the First Special District. Yesterday, a British couple who are usually highly respected were subjected to extremely brutal searches by the Japanese. The victims were Mr. Fentley, a Scotsman, and his German wife. Mrs. Fentley is the female manager of the Country Club. Yesterday afternoon, she and her husband went to the office in the First Special District. They stood in line waiting for the search at the entrance at the southern end of Racecourse Road for over an hour. After watching many Chinese and foreign people pass through, they were finally called into the search hut. The Japanese ordered Mr. Fentley to take off his clothes in front of many Chinese and foreigners, leaving only a shirt and trousers. At the same time, Mrs. Fentley was led to an inner room, where a Chinese female searcher ordered her to remove her hat and inspect her hair in front of a sentry. She was then ordered to remove all her clothes, including her dress and petticoat. Mrs. Fentley immediately asked the Japanese sentry to leave the room, but the soldier only turned his face away for a few seconds before continuing to stare at her. Finally, she was forced to remove her underwear, leaving only a vest. After the female searcher thoroughly inspected her entire body, she was allowed to put on her clothes and leave the room. The Japanese sentry was present throughout, and the door to the room was wide open, so that all passing Chinese and foreigners could see inside. When Mrs. Fentley left the room, she saw her husband standing in the open air, with all his clothes scattered on the ground. Mr. Fentley is the manager of the Mercantile Bank and often assists his wife in the office at the Country Club. Mrs. Fentley is originally from Germany and married Mr. Fentley during his military service in Germany. Currently, British expatriates are reluctant to enter or leave the concessions unless it is for essential duties, in order to avoid being humiliated. Some British employees of the British-American Tobacco Company reside outside the concessions and are therefore spared the humiliation when going to the office in the Third Special District. Mr. Smith, who was previously detained by the Japanese, was released unconditionally at 10:00 this morning. Today, a Reuters reporter who visited him said that he was held in a dirty room with lower-class Chinese criminals for the first two days of his detention, before being moved to a cleaner cell and allowed to buy foreign food. Before his release this morning, the Japanese forced him to sign a paper expressing his apologies for his actions on June 17th. Today, the supply of milk in Tianjin suddenly decreased, greatly affecting the British Municipal Council Hospital. Many patients who rely on milk for sustenance are suffering greatly. It is said that efforts are being made to transport fresh food from Shanghai to Tianjin for relief. The White Russian Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps held a demonstration today, attended by a large number of members of the Anti-Communist Committee. White Russian leader Semenov and several Japanese officials also attended as observers. Fortunately, it passed peacefully without incident. Mr. Semenov and a Japanese officer addressed the crowd. After the parade, more than forty members in uniform sang loudly and proceeded along Wilson Road towards the British concession. The situation was tense for a moment, and the British concession immediately closed its iron gates. However, it was later learned that these people were returning home to the concession after indulging in food and drink, so the iron gates were reopened and they were allowed to pass through.

<h3>The Situation in Tianjin Deteriorates Further; London Times Suggests Implementing Retaliatory Measures; Britain Has Not Notified France of Any Specific Plans; French Foreign Minister Solemnly Declares That the Two Countries' Interests Are Intertwined</h3>
<p>British Labour Party MPs Vigorously Criticize Simon's Policies; Indian Newspaper Criticizes British Government's Attitude of Submission</p>
<p>(London) British foreign authorities are currently closely monitoring the precarious situation in Tianjin and considering implementing retaliatory measures. British Foreign Secretary Halifax has not left London this week, and Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to return today to convene a meeting of the Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee. As further reports of the humiliation of British expatriates in Tianjin have arrived in Britain, it is generally believed that the situation there has deteriorated further. The British government authorities are also deeply concerned about the lack of progress in the British-Soviet negotiations, and are also paying close attention to the news of the movements of German and Polish troops on the French border. The concern of China about the Tianjin case can be seen from the special visit of Counselor Chen of the Chinese Embassy to the British Foreign Office yesterday. According to Foreign Office authorities, the British side believes that the situation in Tianjin is becoming increasingly serious, but the actual situation remains the same as it was several days ago. The London Times today made suggestions on how to deal with Japan, stating that if British expatriates in Tianjin continue to be humiliated, Britain should implement widespread retaliatory measures within the imperial territories, and this should certainly be done in Singapore. A British government spokesman has confirmed that there is a possibility of retaliation in the future, but the Japanese side here views this statement as merely empty threats. The reason for Britain's hesitation is the imperfection of its military preparations. The European peace front has not yet been completed. If retaliation is indeed implemented in the future, it will inevitably lead to a crisis of war. This point has become an open secret. To deal with Japan, the cooperation of the United States is required. It is learned that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, has encouraged the British side after consulting with the commander of the British defense forces in Tianjin. The London Observer commented on the attitude of the United States, stating that the United States is less isolated in Asia than in Europe, and the country's isolationist sentiment is decreasing daily. (25th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Calcutta, India: Yesterday, the "Political" newspaper here published a commentary criticizing the British side's attitude of submission to Japan's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin. The newspaper said, "Most countries currently believe that the British ministers are a group of teachers without courage, and the Japanese side, due to the British government's overly cowardly attitude, has regarded Britain as a 'shameless' nation." (25th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Bonnet solemnly declared at a political meeting yesterday that the interests of Britain and France are intertwined. Regarding the Tianjin incident, Britain has not notified the French government of any specific retaliatory plans, as London is still seeking to ascertain the intentions of the Japanese government. The French government hopes that this matter can be resolved locally, especially in light of the recent attitude of the US government. The mood here is that the progress of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is not as optimistic as it was a few days ago. Bonnet reviewed these negotiations at the political meeting. (25th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech at a Conservative Party meeting in Cardiff today, touching on the Far East. His conclusion was: "I must add that the treatment of British expatriates in Tianjin, as we have heard, is not acceptable to the British government, and the British government's foreign policy cannot accept orders dictated by other countries. I hope my observation is not mistaken, that the Japanese government's intention is not such, that it has no intention of condoning the behavior of its soldiers, and that it has no intention of provoking the rights and interests of the British people in China." (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Morrison, a Labour Party MP and chairman of the London County Council, delivered a speech here today, again vigorously criticizing the policies pursued by Chancellor Simon during his tenure as Foreign Secretary, stating that Sir John Simon bears a major responsibility for the current situation in China and should resign to apologize to the people of the country. Resignation is also necessary for the benefit of the Conservative Party itself. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Four Days and Nights of Bloody Fighting: Japanese Attack on Zhongtiao Mountain Ultimately Unsuccessful; Battles Continue Fiercely Around Yuanqu; Japanese Troops Suffer Heavy Losses Near Gaoluo and Retreat to Hengling Pass</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing dispatch: The Chinese army is implementing its established plans step by step, and its fighting strength is increasing. Japanese troops in southern Shanxi have reinforced and are fiercely attacking Zhongtiao Mountain again. After four days and nights of bloody fighting, they were heavily attacked by the Chinese army, suffering nearly 2,000 casualties. A large number of Chinese reinforcements have arrived at their destinations, and the battle situation will greatly expand. There are no major battles in central Hubei. There are only 400 to 500 Japanese troops remaining in Qianjiang. The Chinese army is besieging them and will resolve the situation soon. (25th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Japanese troops in Yuanqu shelled the southern bank of the river on the afternoon of the 24th, engaging in fierce artillery battles with the Chinese across the river, seemingly to cover their retreat. The Japanese troops in Wangmao Town (northwest of Yuanqu) and Gaoluo were attacked by Chinese troops from both sides of the Gao-Yuan Highway. The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses and have retreated entirely to Hengling Pass. Before fleeing, they burned all the houses in Gaoluo. Chinese troops are pursuing them. Furthermore, after Chinese Koukou and another units established contact, they jointly counterattacked the Japanese troops facing them. The Japanese troops were unable to resist and retreated northeast. The Japanese troops south of Zhujiazhen and Shangxiahengyu (southwest of Gaoluo) have been completely cleared, and Chinese troops have regained their original positions. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The battles around Yuanqu are still proceeding fiercely. After the Chinese armies were ordered to attack the Japanese from both sides, and after a senior commander personally oversaw the front lines, morale immediately soared, and the offensive became more sharp. There were reports of victories on all fronts. In total, the Chinese army has killed or wounded over 2,000 Japanese soldiers in the past three days. A portion of the Chinese army has now approached Yuanqu. The Japanese troops, under pressure from the Chinese army, have mostly retreated east. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, news was received here from the Chinese army in Shanxi stating that the Chinese army has recently withdrawn from Yuanqu and has retreated into the nearby mountains. (25th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military news: On the 19th, 400 Japanese troops with three artillery pieces and over 30 vehicles invaded Dawangyin (over 30 li northeast of Zaoqiang) from Longhua Town, Jing County, Hebei Province, and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army throughout the day, ultimately failing to succeed. At dawn on the 20th, the Japanese launched another fierce attack and occupied the eastern end of the village, resulting in a fierce street battle. Chinese regimental commander Zhang Yuting took the lead, bravely charging and killing. After three hours of bloody fighting, he dispatched a battalion to attack the Japanese flank. At 10:00 in the morning, they finally recaptured their original positions, annihilating most of the Japanese troops. The Japanese collapsed and retreated. In this battle, over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, over 40 bodies were left behind, and over 40 rifles were seized. (Gan 25th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Multiple Japanese Aircraft Attack Jiangxi in Batches</h3>
<p>Ji'an: Eighteen Japanese aircraft attacked Jiangxi again in batches on the 25th. The first batch of three aircraft invaded Jiangxi from Guangdong. At around 12:00 noon, they sneaked into Ruijin and dropped four bombs. There were no losses on the Chinese side. The second batch of three aircraft also invaded Jiangxi from Guangdong. At 12:50, they entered Jiangxian, reconnoitered, and then fled to Nanchang before returning to Guangdong. They dropped four bombs in Qujiang. The third batch of three aircraft sneaked from northern Jiangxi to Lishui, Zhejiang, at around 2:00 p.m. and dropped four bombs. The fourth batch of six aircraft sneaked into southern Jiangxi at around 2:40 p.m., reconnoitered in Yudu, Xingguo, and other counties for a long time, and then fled. The fifth batch of three aircraft sneaked from eastern Zhejiang into Fujian, reconnoitered, and then fled north along their original route. (25th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rumors That Wang Jingwei Is Negotiating Conditions With the Japanese</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin dispatch: According to sources close to the Japanese, Wang Jingwei has proposed conditions to the Japanese, requesting that the puppet Federal Government be established in Nanjing and continue to use the Blue Sky White Sun flag. The Japanese have also proposed two conditions: (1) the puppet Federal Government signs an anti-communist pact with Japan, allowing Japan to station troops in necessary areas in the north and south; (2) an economic agreement is signed with Japan, with China's heavy industrial resources managed and operated by Japan. Both sides have generally agreed. (25th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Is Japan Fighting for Economics?</h3>
<p>A righteous cause makes one bold; moreover, the distinction between appearance and reality, and right and wrong, cannot be blurred. Whoever initiates the conflict bears the responsibility. China is fighting for survival and to uphold the independence and freedom of the nation; this will surely be recognized by the world and future generations. But what is Japan fighting for?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, Japan claimed that China's three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang were its lifeline, so it was fighting to secure this lifeline. To regard the rich resources and territories of a neighboring country as one's own lifeline and attempt to seize them by force is undeniably wrong. Midway through the war, Japan claimed that China was becoming communist, and it was fighting to eradicate communism. China, however, was founded on the Three Principles of the People, which even the Communist Party adheres to, demonstrating the falsity of the claim of communism. Furthermore, what does the ideology of a neighboring country have to do with Japan? Japan also claimed that East Asia needed a new order, and it was fighting to establish this new order. But what is this new order? "Those who obey me shall live, and those who resist me shall die," using an iron fist to enslave other races, preventing them from ever rising again. Establishing a new order means establishing a master-servant relationship, with no other meaning. Japan further claimed that it was staking its national destiny on this, and therefore fighting to place China's sovereignty under its control (as stated by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on May 24th). The logic of this wording and definition is no different from saying, "I am taking a desperate risk, so I will kill with a knife." All these claims are fragmented, contradictory, and utterly false. It is no wonder that even after years of war, members of the Japanese Diet still questioned their government: "What is Japan fighting for?"</p>
<p>However, the essence of China's resistance is extremely clear. Therefore, to end China's resistance, it is only necessary to restore China's sovereignty, land, and administrative integrity. Because Japan's cause is without merit, it can only resolve the war through war. In other words, only when it wins to the point where further fighting is unnecessary, or when it loses to the point where further fighting is impossible, will the war end. If one seeks a solution to the war outside of war itself, the world has long abandoned such hopes. However, yesterday a London dispatch reported that Sir George Paish, a British baronet, made a grand statement, the gist of which was:</p>
<p>"Within Japan, there are differing views on the government's current policies. Businessmen and industrialists generally do not support the war against China, believing that peace is the best path for trade. The current situation in the Far East is a direct result of global economic policies. Because countries implement protectionist tariffs, and Japan has a population of 100 million people, increasing by one million each year, with limited domestic resources, it remains a poor country despite having cultivated all available land. Many Japanese businessmen and ordinary people, excluding the military, have told me that they are prepared to resolve the China issue and wish to coexist peacefully with China. However, they do not know how to achieve this goal without losing face. In short, Japan must withdraw from China, but to make this possible, the world should plan a future for Japan, allowing it to sell its goods and provide its population with a reasonable standard of living. From a military perspective, Japan's finances are strained and cannot allow the current situation to continue. From this perspective, it is clear that Japan will adopt a rational attitude in the near future."</p>
<p>Sir Paish is a renowned British economist who recently returned to England after traveling to Japan. Yesterday, he delivered the above speech at the invitation of a certain international affairs gathering. The cable transmission was likely less than one-tenth of his full speech, but the essence is probably no more than this. His analysis of cause and effect is insightful, and naturally welcomed by those who pay attention to Japan's wartime internal affairs. Although there are a few points in the above excerpt that do not form a logical cause and effect, this must be due to the brevity of the cable transmission, and not contradictions from the renowned scholar. After hearing this from afar, what we cannot refrain from saying is: Sir Paish calls Japan a poor country and attributes the current situation in the Far East to the current economic policies of various countries, suggesting that the cause of Japan's invasion of China lies here. He also suggests that the world should plan an economic way out for Japan, implying that the method to end Japan's invasion of China lies here. If Sir Paish is correct, then the answer to the question "What is Japan fighting for?" held by both Japanese and non-Japanese people lies in this. However, is it really so?</p>
<p>Sir Paish is a renowned economist; the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. Therefore, economists view all phenomena through the lens of economics. However, we do not consider Sir Paish's view to be a prejudice. Tracing the path of human civilization and evolution over thousands of years to the present, international problems in terms of scope, and social problems in terms of depth; entrusting the resolution of problems to religion, general culture, or seeking solutions in science, or even resorting to war; and ultimately attributing everything to economics is something we are willing to frankly acknowledge. Therefore, Sir Paish's statement is fundamentally correct. It is a pity that Japan does not act accordingly. Taking a step back, Japan cannot escape this principle in reality. It is a pity that Japan is not aware of this. In the current era of international competition, regardless of political measures, military plans, and actions, everything is viewed through an economic lens, and politics and military affairs are merely tools. Japan is not like this. It is still blindly obsessed with realizing its military ideals and fulfilling its political ambitions, viewing economics as merely a tool. Therefore, from the early stages of its invasion of China to the present, the various explanations and expressions of its authorities have never hinted that its desires lie in economics. Furthermore, it fundamentally criticizes its military aggression and violates the ironclad rules of economics. We do not have the space to provide a detailed argument in this short article. However, at the very least, the opportunities that China has historically provided to Japan in the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang to develop its economy and alleviate its poverty, which Japan has never fully utilized, can prove that Japan's consciousness and desires are not in economics. That is, the invasion of China after the September 18th Incident, and the disasters in the Far East over the past few years, are not caused by economics.</p>
<p>The fault lies with Japan in the Far East, and the responsibility lies with Japan. However, Japan's consciousness and desires are not in economics. Therefore, Sir Paish's suggestion of planning for Japan's economy is not enough to prompt Japan to change its course. It can be asserted. Therefore, in today's situation, China has no other option but to resist, and friendly nations must also recognize that, in addition to resolving the war through war, there is no need to harbor any other hope. If one hopes to resolve the situation outside of war, one must wait for Japan to fully awaken and abandon its political ambitions and military ideals! Otherwise, giving it an economic lifeline will only strengthen its political ambition and military expansion.</p>
<h3>Soviet "Izvestia" Publishes Article on the Failure of Japan's Invasion Plan in China</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia recently published an article entitled "The Crushing of the Japanese Imperialist Strategic Plan for the Invasion of China," analyzing the development of the war situation since the Japanese army's provocation at Lugouqiao, stating, "Japanese imperialism, in preparing for the invasion, did not originally want to fall into a protracted war in China. Because of its limited domestic economic resources, Japanese fascism tried to achieve a quick victory in order to preserve its strength and prepare for further aggression. Therefore, all of the Japanese warlords' operational intentions were to decisively annihilate the Chinese army and force the Chinese government to surrender.</p>
<p>"However, the loss of territory has not caused the Chinese government and people to surrender. On the contrary, the deeper the invaders penetrate, the higher the Chinese people's will to fight against the enemy. During the two years of resistance, the highest Chinese military authorities have completed the strategic policy of protracted war. The basis of the Chinese operational plan is the unstable economic position and domestic and international situation of Japanese imperialism, which makes it impossible for it to sustain a protracted war. Therefore, the Chinese army must find ways to prolong the war, temporarily sacrifice part of the territory to preserve its strength, gradually and decisively exhaust the Japanese people's blood, and finally deliver a fatal blow." Izvestia continued to discuss the further development of the war, with special emphasis on the Chinese army's counteroffensive in April, saying, "The Chinese army's counteroffensive in April 1939 was an extremely important event. This activity, spread across a vast front, was not intended to deliver a decisive blow to the enemy. The Chinese people and army are working hard to prepare for such a blow, but its implementation is still to be awaited in the near future. "The main purpose of the April counteroffensive was to solve two major problems: first, to attract the Japanese army's forces in the guerrilla areas; second, to contain the Japanese army's actions with simultaneous counteroffensives on all fronts, preventing them from concentrating.</p>
<p>"These two tasks have been gloriously completed. The Chinese army has recovered many cities and towns. The Japanese army's casualties during this period are estimated to be in the tens of thousands. From this point of view, the April counteroffensive is actually equal to the summary of the achievements of the two years of resistance. During this period, the Chinese army has increased new strength, expanded its forces, and improved its combat and moral qualities through fierce battles.</p>
<p>"The basis of the Chinese army's resistance is its strong rear and the unity of the people. At present, more than a million heroic guerrillas, including the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, are working hard to harass the invading army's rear, fighting side by side with the regular army everywhere.</p>
<p>Izvestia finally summarized the achievements of China's two years of resistance, saying, "The fact that Japanese imperialism has had to fight in China for two years and still cannot achieve the expected victory in itself proves that the Japanese warlords' strategic plan for a quick victory has completely failed. Although the Japanese fascist military clique has successively increased its troops in China, from 325,000 to five or six times that number, although it has reorganized its national economy on a wartime basis, and although it has spent more than 100 billion yen in war expenses, thereby almost exhausting its gold reserves and military material reserves, the result is still that it has not achieved its goals.</p>
<p>"The Chinese people are still continuing their resistance and are working hard to prepare to defeat the invaders in the Far East in one fell swoop, making them unable to recover." (TASS dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Occupation of Dinghai Intended to Alleviate Anti-War Sentiment</h3>
<p>A certain place in eastern Jiangxi. Dinghai fell on the 23rd. Our reporter today visited a certain military expert to inquire about his opinion on the Japanese occupation of Dinghai. According to him, since the Japanese occupied Wuhan and Nanchang, they have been militarily lost, in a dilemma, and do not know what to do. The recent disastrous defeats of the Japanese in the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Henan, as well as in western Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, are all enough to clarify that the Japanese have reached the end of their rope. The Japanese warlords are deeply afraid that this will cause domestic turmoil, so they have launched the Xiamen incident at the risk of great injustice, blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin, and recently occupied Shantou. The purpose is to threaten Britain, the United States, and France, and to stimulate the people and alleviate anti-war sentiment. The Japanese occupation of Dinghai is no different in meaning. As for its military value, it is extremely insignificant. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, intense fighting is taking place in Dinghai, the largest city and town on Zhoushan Island. The Japanese army landed on the island opposite Ningbo on June 23 under the cover of naval and air bombardment. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Express Gratification After the Announcement of the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty; Progress is Also Evident in Sino-Soviet Transportation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese government officially announced today that the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty was signed in Moscow on June 16th. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, signed on behalf of the Chinese government as a special envoy of the Chinese government, while Mikoyan, Director of the Soviet Foreign Trade Bureau, signed on behalf of the Soviet government.

<p>(Moscow) Soviet newspapers today did not list the contents of the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and China on the 16th of this month, but TASS officially released the above news last night. It is reported that Chinese representative Sun Ke has been in Moscow for three months, and Stalin personally received him, but Soviet newspapers have always kept silent about this matter, which is particularly noteworthy. It is also the day when the Soviet Union and China signed the commercial treaty when British special envoy Strang arrived in Moscow, but the news was not revealed until after the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Britain and France had stalled. In the future, the amount of Soviet military supplies transported to China will increase. Furthermore, transportation from Soviet-controlled Central Asia to Xinjiang and western China has made significant progress compared to before. Transportation by large trucks is now unhindered.

<h3>Multiple Bombings in London Overnight; Irish Government Orders Dissolution of IRA</h3>
<p>(London) Three explosions occurred in central London tonight. In the explosion that occurred at Piccadilly Circus at around 9:00 PM, at least three people were injured, one of whom has been sent to the hospital for treatment. The second occurred an hour later in Piccadilly. In the blink of an eye, a third incident occurred in the Aldwych area, resulting in six injuries, four of whom have been taken to the hospital by ambulance. The police have apprehended three people for questioning. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The Irish Republican Army launched another terrorist act last night, causing four bombs to explode in London. The city's police officers made every effort to prepare beforehand, so many of the bombers were arrested on the spot. It is reported that the first bomb exploded in front of the "Piccadilly" circus gate. At that time, it was just after the show, so the spectators going out were extremely crowded, resulting in a young newspaper seller being injured and falling to the ground at the entrance of the underground train, and three passersby being injured by fragments of glass windows. In addition, another person was injured in the abdomen by glass, bleeding heavily, and was immediately sent to the hospital for emergency treatment by ambulance. The police closely followed the terrorists and chased after them, finally capturing one of them in the crowd. Afterwards, another bomb exploded in front of the Lloyd's Bank on Wellington Street, causing the windows along the street to shatter in response, and glass fragments fell on the heads of pedestrians, resulting in six serious injuries who were sent to the hospital for treatment. In addition, a patrol officer was also injured by glass fragments. The third bomb exploded near the Midland Bank on the street, and three terrorists were arrested on the spot. Afterwards, a Molotov cocktail exploded in a bunker in Marylebone, but fortunately the firefighters were able to put it out, so a major disaster was avoided. Associated Press reporter Sibon witnessed two people being arrested and personally saw a police officer forcibly capturing a bomber who was fleeing. The police officer said to Sibon, "I firmly believe that the arrested person is the terrorist who threw the bomb." According to reports, the Irish authorities banned the IRA's activities on Friday. (Associated Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Four banks in London's West End were heavily damaged last night by bombs thrown by the Irish Republican Army. The police have arrested four people. The situation was very tense after the bombs exploded in the West End. The police requisitioned streetcars to direct traffic on the footboards and dispatched the National Guard and mounted police to assist in maintaining order on the road and suppressing the crowded crowds. At that time, one person was chased by an angry crowd, and everyone shouted, "Kill him," but his life was saved by the police's rescue. An unexploded bomb was found in the cloakroom of the Oxford Theater. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>British and French Agree on Principles of Military Cooperation to Prevent War in the Far East, Using the China Sea as the Center of Resistance, and Cooperating to Protect Borneo</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the meeting between the British and French army and naval generals stationed in the Far East in Singapore, well-informed sources here recently stated that the principle of close cooperation between the British and French naval, land, and air forces in the Far East has been affirmed by this meeting. In the event of war in the future, the navies of both sides will be under the command of Admiral Noble, commander of the British fleet stationed in China, and the China Sea will be the center of resistance. In addition, the Singapore meeting discussed the following issues: The Japanese army has occupied Hainan Island and the New Southern Islands, which is enough to threaten Vietnam and blockade Hong Kong, but in terms of the situation in Hong Kong, even if it is surrounded by enemy forces in wartime, it can be defended for a long time, waiting for the navy to be sent from Europe to assist, this is one. The Kingdom of Siam has close relations with Britain and France, and will be able to maintain benevolent neutrality in wartime, this is two. Borneo (belonging to Britain and the Netherlands) is an oil-producing area, which will inevitably be coveted by enemy countries in wartime, and will be jointly defended by Britain and France, this is three. In addition, there was a saying that the Netherlands indirectly participated in the Singapore meeting, and the government of that country has recognized it, saying that it is eager to maintain a detached position. As for the United States, although it did not participate in the meeting, if the fleet of that country joins the war in the Far East, the Singapore naval port will be allowed to use it.

<h3>Singapore Meeting Closed Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Considering the Issue of Japanese Military Advance to the South</h3>
<p>Singapore. The joint meeting of British and French army and naval leaders continued to meet yesterday to consider the issue of the Japanese military's advance to the south and the strategic significance of the Japanese military's occupation of Hainan Island and the New Southern Islands. Attendees deeply considered the Japanese policy of invading uninhabited islands in the eastern part of Asia as a place for Japanese to reside, because such actions, once Britain and France officially fight against Japan, will pose a threat to Britain and France.

<h3>Difficulties in Renewing Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Osaka. Japanese commercial firms are now watching with deep concern the Indian government's future policies regarding the renewal of the expiring Indo-Japanese commercial treaty. Yamada, the final manager of the Indian Karachi office of the Japan Cotton Association, has been in India for 20 years and recently returned to Japan to discuss this issue, warning Japan that it must proceed with great caution in seeking to renew the treaty, because in view of the current world situation, it is expected that India will take a tough stance. Yamada also stated that this year's Indian cotton crop is low, resulting in a sharp decline in general purchasing power, so it is expected that the Indian government will implement strict restrictions on the import of Japanese goods. The treaty that is about to expire was concluded by Japan and India alone. Now the Indian government will consider the recently concluded Anglo-Indian commercial treaty. Indian capitals know the position Japan is in and cannot take a tough stance or suggest actions to boycott Indian cotton. Therefore, it is expected that the Indian government will not make concessions. In fact, Indian capitals have clearly not taken any action to prepare for the renewal of the treaty. What is difficult is that since India and Japan adopted a barter system, Japanese exporters have flooded the Indian market with large quantities of cotton yarn and cloth of very poor quality. The motive was to hope to obtain the right to import Indian cotton. As a result, this kind of low-quality cotton yarn and cloth is now overstocked in the Indian market. The only solution is for Japanese merchants to focus on exporting high-quality cotton cloth, allowing it to be printed cloth, although according to India's current customs tax rate, the tax levied on Japanese printed cotton cloth is eleven times higher than that of British goods, but according to Yamada's opinion, Japanese goods can still compete with British Lancashire cotton cloth.

<h3>The Dutch East Indies Intensifies Expansion of its Army and Navy, Increasing Troop Strength and Improving Armaments</h3>
<p>The authorities in Batavia, observing the turbulent and uneasy situation in Europe and the Far East, are rapidly implementing a large-scale plan to strengthen the defenses of the Dutch East Indies. This plan aims to increase the East Indies army by at least one-quarter. A large number of the latest military equipment, including various cannons, anti-aircraft guns, and the fastest tanks, are arriving on every ship from Europe. Batavia has a senior commander and large garrison stationed around the city. All activities and the entire military organization present a picture of high efficiency, enjoying an unprecedented reputation. The authorities are paying great attention to improving the army's air force. The headquarters of the air force is also located in Batavia. The Glenn Martin bomber squadron is being increased; these bombers are estimated to have a range of 2,000 miles. New equipment is being added, such as Fokker fighter planes and other types of aircraft. The army's air force recently completed its largest public performance in history, celebrating its 25th anniversary. Thousands of spectators gathered around the perimeter of the Batavia airfield, witnessing the large bomber formations taking to the skies, and the flight formations of fighter squadrons. Increasing the East Indies army involves adding troops from the Netherlands, and increasing the strength of the native troops. It is rumored that a large number of soldiers will be recruited locally. To accelerate progress and reduce training costs, a new method has been established, integrating the local militia into the regular army during their mandatory military training. The militia, composed of Europeans residing in the Dutch East Indies, all undergo eight months to one year of mandatory military training. Half of this year's total budget for the Dutch East Indies is now being used to expand the army and navy, which is a fact of great significance. However, opinions differ here on the rumored supply of battleships to the Dutch East Indies navy in the future. Some believe that their maintenance costs will become an excessive burden.

<h3>Japan Pursues Wartime Economy, National Economic Structure Loses Balance as a Result</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department has released a report stating that Japan is effectively pursuing a wartime economy. The production, import, price, and distribution of various goods within the country are almost entirely managed by the government, resulting in an imbalance in the national economic structure. To maintain currency value, imports are limited to essential goods, and their quantity is also limited to what is needed. Meanwhile, its export industry has declined. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Latest Military Aircraft Being Built by U.S. Government</h3>
<p>(Washington) Among the various new types of aircraft ordered by the United States to strengthen its air force, there is a thoroughly improved design. All performance aspects greatly exceed any military aircraft in the world, and it has a speed of over 400 miles per hour. The name of this aircraft is the Lockheed XPL-38, a twin-engine fighter with six heavy machine guns mounted in the nose. If the initial batch of more than ten aircraft proves satisfactory, the US Army may order over one hundred more. According to US Air Force leader Major General Arnold recently, the performance of this aircraft will exceed that of any military aircraft in the world. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italian and German Armies Preparing for Large-Scale Maneuvers on French Border</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to reliable sources last night, the Italian army will conduct large-scale exercises in the Po River Valley (located on the back side of the Alps, which forms the Italian-French border) in August. Authoritative sources deny that the Italian army's autumn maneuvers are a demonstration against the French army's autumn maneuvers. It is rumored that the Italian army will depart from the Venetian province, on the Yugoslav border, and stage a simulated attack against the Italian troops "defending Piedmont." (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that German troops are conducting large-scale military operations on the French border today, preparing for summer exercises. Germany is working hard to build fortresses at the intersection of the German, French, and Swiss borders. Germany is concentrating heavy troops in Trier and Saarbrücken, which are directly opposite the great military zone of northeastern France (i.e., the Maginot Line). German troops are rebuilding fortresses in the mountains near the Swiss border, intending to make the area one of the strongest defensive zones in Europe. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<h3>German-Yugoslav Oil Negotiations Have Not Yet Reached Agreement</h3>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Yesterday, reports from Germany claimed that the Yugoslav government had ceded oil and other goods to Germany. Well-informed sources here have since corrected this, stating that although negotiations between the two countries regarding Yugoslavia ceding the right for Germany to explore and develop an oil field of 18,000 square kilometers in northern Yugoslavia have entered the final stage, no agreement has yet been reached. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations Expected to Reach Compromise, Three Countries' Interests Completely Aligned</h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of The Observer claims that although the negotiations currently underway in Moscow have been repeatedly delayed, it would be incorrect to say that the hope of a final compromise has diminished. The consistency of the interests of Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is indeed a crucial point, and it has not diminished in the slightest. The complete alignment of the three countries' interests will certainly lead to results. The main point of contention at present remains the Baltic states' refusal to accept allied guarantees, while the Soviet Union believes that the feelings of the Baltic states are irrelevant. The purpose of the alliance is to repel German aggression. If Germany invades the Baltic states, it will be tantamount to indirectly invading the Soviet Union. Therefore, regardless of the willingness of the Baltic states, an alliance must be concluded to protect them. This move is not for the benefit of the Baltic states, but for the benefit of Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Economist Discusses Far East Situation: Japan's Financial Difficulties Make Sustained Military Action Unlikely</h3>
<p>(London) Prominent ladies and gentlemen from various countries recently held a gathering here to discuss international issues. Sir Basil Blackett, a well-known British economist, had just returned from Japan and attended the meeting to report on the situation in the Far East. He said, in brief, that domestic opinions in Japan on the current policies of the Japanese government are divided, much like the situation in Britain. Business and industrial figures do not support the war against China, and believe that peace is the best path for trade. "The current situation in the Far East is a direct result of global economic policies. Countries are implementing protectionist tariffs. Japan has a population of 100 million, increasing by one million annually. Its domestic resources are extremely limited. Although the entire territory has been reclaimed for farmland, it is still a poor country in reality. Farmers cannot even afford to buy rice. They rely on growing their own vegetables and supplementing with a small amount of fish. Generally, people in the country outside of the business and military circles have told me that they are ready to resolve the China issue and are willing to get along with China in a friendly manner. However, they don't know how to achieve this goal without losing face. Therefore, it is necessary to end the war between China and Japan. However, I have found that there is a very unthinking segment of the Japanese population who believe that Britain is currently encountering great difficulties in Europe, and therefore there is no real force to oppose Japan's actions in China. In fact, we should first resolve the Far East problem, and then the European problem can be easily solved. In short, Japan must withdraw from China, but if this is to be achieved, the world should plan a future for Japan, so that it can sell its goods, feed its population, and maintain reasonable health. As for the military aspect, Japan's financial difficulties cannot allow the current situation to continue for long. Even oil alone is extremely scarce and must be restricted in its use. From this perspective, Japan will adopt a reasonable attitude in the short term," he said. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>US Factories Prepare for Wartime Mobilization</h3>
<p>(Washington) Colonel White, Chief of Staff of the US Army, declared, "10,000 US factories are now prepared for total wartime mobilization, but it will take 12 months to transform ordinary industries into complex wartime industries." Colonel White also pointed out that industrial mobilization can indeed make national industries cooperate more closely and increase production effectively, so as to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of what is needed in wartime. In addition, the US defense mobilization plan can increase the official army of 400,000 to 1 million within three months. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Efforts Futile, German Newspaper Criticizes British Prime Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Political figures here are commenting on British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Cardiff with ironic tones. The semi-official German News Agency reported, "The collusive actions of the British Foreign Office are trying to cover up and make people believe that they are seeking understanding and consultation with Germany. In fact, their efforts are futile. As of today, Germany has no need to explain to the world where the responsibility lies for the failure of Britain and Germany to reach a compromise. Perhaps Prime Minister Chamberlain speaks of the possibility of cooperation between Britain and Germany because he wants Germany to give some kind of guarantee so that when the Soviet Union demands too high a price from Britain, there will be something to resist."

<h3>Franco-Turkish Mutual Assistance Declaration Displeases Italy, Italian Newspaper Urges Bulgaria to Take Back Lost Territories, British Newspaper Says Maginot Line Extended</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian side is very dissatisfied with the signing of the mutual assistance declaration between France and Turkey. Because Turkey has colluded with various democracies, and it is possible to establish an agreement with Egypt, Turkey may assist Egypt in protecting the Suez Canal in the event of a future war in the Mediterranean. As a result, the warships of the Axis powers cannot pass through the Dardanelles Strait, nor can they enter the Red Sea. Italy is extremely resentful of this and is launching a large-scale diplomatic offensive. One target of the offensive is the Balkan Peninsula, with Bulgaria being the most important. The other target is the Arabian Peninsula, because the Arab peoples are dissatisfied after the British government published a white paper on the Palestine issue. It is easy to take the opportunity to incite them. As far as Bulgaria is concerned, Italy will urge the country to demand the return of lost territories from Romania and Greece. (The Dobruja region of Romania and the Macedonia region of Greece both belonged to Bulgaria before the European War.) Italian newspapers are now filled with propaganda on this issue, saying that Bulgaria will not be able to recover its lost territories unless it follows the Axis powers. As for the Arabian Peninsula, key figures from various Arab countries have been in frequent contact with the Axis authorities. Italy is very optimistic about the future and believes that the difficulties Britain is encountering in the Far East will affect Britain's attitude towards the Arabs in the Near East. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, newspapers here are publishing angry criticisms of the Franco-Turkish Sanjak cession agreement, denouncing it as a betrayal of countries with mandates and as an act hostile to Italy. The Italian People's Newspaper compares France's actions in ceding territory to Turkey with the French government's repeated refusal of Italy's demands. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Franco-Turkish agreement, London newspapers only make brief comments. For example, the "Daily Express" states that this agreement has extended the Maginot Line to the eastern Mediterranean. However, provincial newspapers discuss it in detail. For example, the "Yorkshire Post" (the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden) states, "Local disputes can sometimes be very sharp (referring to the dispute between France and Turkey over the Sanjak region), but they can still promote political connections. The Franco-Turkish agreement is one example. This agreement is of great significance to the relationship between the Suez Canal and the Balkan Peninsula. Now, Great Britain, France, and Turkey have united because of common interests. Britain's expression of happiness over the Franco-Turkish agreement is well-founded." In addition, the "Manchester Guardian" points out, "France and Turkey have now reached an agreement before Great Britain and the Soviet Union. After all, the problem of the Sanjak region is easier to solve than the problem of guaranteeing the Baltic countries. The port of Alexandretta in that area is the best port in the eastern Mediterranean and can become a naval base for Turkey." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>After the Franco-Turkish agreement was signed the day before yesterday, the Sanjak region will be incorporated into Turkish territory.

<h3>American Jewish Zionist Movement</h3>
<p>(New York) The American Jewish Zionist movement held a conference here today. It was attended by a thousand representatives from forty-four states, chaired by Goldman, the leader of the Zionist movement committee. They immediately presented the British government's white paper on the Palestine issue for discussion. The chairman first read a telegram from President Roosevelt, which stated that American Jews had participated in the development of Palestine and made great contributions, which were worthy of pride. Although the Zionist movement is encountering various difficulties, the great progress Palestine has made can hardly be eliminated. It is hoped that the discussions at your conference will produce a truly constructive spirit, which is also symbolic of the spirit of various American undertakings. The future development of Palestine truly depends on it. Committee Secretary Margolis then submitted a report to the conference, stating that all resolutions of this meeting will be submitted for discussion at the World Zionist Congress to be held in Geneva in August of this year.

<h3>US Dockworkers Respond to Stimson's Call to Refuse to Ship Scrap Iron to Japan, US Political Circles Study the Issue of Banning Arms Shipments to Japan</h3>
<p>The British ship "Whiteington" in Tacoma, Washington, was forced to stop here today because dockworkers refused to cross a picket line formed by the "Committee Against Participating in Japanese Aggression." It is reported that the ship intends to transport a large amount of scrap iron to Japan. The "Committee Against Participating in Japanese Aggression" is an organization chaired by former Secretary of State Stimson. Its main task is to urge Americans not to ship war materials to Japan. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The issue of whether the United States will ban arms shipments to Japan has been hotly debated in political circles for a long time. Since the recent events in the Far East, opinions have converged. The reasons for the change in American sentiment on this issue can be stated in three points: First, from a moral standpoint, according to recent official statistics, Japan's military purchases from other countries, those from the United States, account for 57 percent. Some people in the public opinion world are quite uneasy, and all ask whether the United States is indirectly responsible for Japan's continued aggression against China. Second, from an economic standpoint, according to reports recently received by the State Department, Japan's recent offensive against foreign concessions in China is aimed at the Chinese legal tender (Fabi), with the intention of preventing Fabi from circulating in the occupied areas. This is in contrast to the United States providing China with a $50 million loan to help maintain the status of Fabi. Naturally, we cannot turn a blind eye to this type of erosion by Japan. Third, it is the view of the State Department. Namely, after Japan's invasion erodes Chinese interests, its goals are expanding more and more. It first attacks the Soviet Union, saying that it should not supply China with arms. Then it accuses France of supplying China through French Indochina. Now it is launching an offensive against British concessions in China. At this moment, although the United States has not been directly harmed by the Tianjin incident, the results of Japan's actions will eventually damage American interests. Although the United States is not in a position to use force to stop this "aggression" against the interests of various countries, it would be the right thing to do to stop supplying Japan with war materials. However, to ban arms shipments to Japan, President Roosevelt must first declare that a state of war exists between China and Japan before a ban can be issued. This action, considering the current neutrality law, would be sufficient to strike at Japan, but the impact on China, which is under attack, would be no less than that on the aggressor. This is the reason why President Roosevelt should not declare an embargo. Under these circumstances, only economic sanctions are still possible. US experts are currently studying it. There is a precedent for this matter. Previously, after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the United States imposed an additional tax of 25% on imports from Germany to show its punishment. Now, a similar approach may be adopted for Japan. The increasing anger towards Japan in public opinion is also enough to facilitate government action. Certain isolationists have expressed concern that this move may draw the United States into the whirlpool of war. In fact, Japan's economic and military situation is becoming increasingly difficult. According to a report released today by the Foreign Policy Association, if the country were to participate in a great war, its remaining gold would certainly be exhausted quickly, thus encountering a great crisis that would be far more serious than the current difficult situation. Based on this, the idea that the United States will be drawn into the whirlpool of war is just unfounded worry. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Dutch-German Trade Agreement Concluded</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency has received a report from the capital of the Netherlands stating that the Netherlands has concluded a trade agreement with Germany. The agreement stipulates that trade between the Netherlands and the German protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia will be settled in cash. It will take effect on July 1 and has no time limit, but it is stipulated to last until another method is agreed upon at a later date. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>US Senate Discusses Government's Authority to Use Large Sums of Money, Borah and Others Oppose Roosevelt's Proposal</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently sent separate letters to the speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives, requesting authorization for the government to allocate $3.5 billion, of which $3 billion is intended to be used to carry out various public works projects, and $500 million would be used as credit loans to be provided by the Federal Export-Import Bank to various countries to develop their trade with the United States. At the Senate meeting today, Republican Senator Borah was the first to express his opposition to this request, and said that Congress must not grant the government the power to act expediently. In other words, it should maintain its own power so that it can decide under what conditions credit loans can be granted to foreign countries. Democratic Senator Lucas then spoke, and his views were the same as Borah's. This case was not included on the Senate's agenda, but most senators hold an opposing attitude, which can be seen from the opinions expressed by Borah and Lucas. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Cooperation: The Stumbling Block in Negotiations</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>Inconsistent preparations on both sides, differing opinions on the completion of the alliance, and complicated establishment of mutual trust.</p>
<p>London Correspondence</p>
<p>The Anglo-Soviet cooperation negotiations, which have been going on for some time, are still continuing in this manner. Perhaps another "crisis" will have to arrive before a leap forward response can solidify it. Here is a brief account of the current situation.</p>
<p>(1) Three Different Questions</p>
<p>According to an eyewitness, when the recent Soviet reply arrived at the British Foreign Office, the current Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately scratched his head and said to a visitor: "These Russians are really difficult to deal with! What exactly do they want?" This question perfectly represents the confusion of the general British public. However, Foreign Secretary Halifax himself clearly knows the crux of the matter; of course, the enlightened British, led by people like Lloyd George, Churchill, and Eden, are even more aware.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Molotov, who also serves as the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, openly asked in a formal speech: "Do the current British and French authorities really want to resist aggression?" His words naturally represent the opinions of Stalin and the general Soviet public. However, regardless of the subjective attitudes of both sides, countries that are equally friendly to both Britain and the Soviet Union are most concerned about the concrete establishment of this cooperative negotiation. Therefore, in countries such as Poland and Turkey, the common question is: "Where exactly is the crux of the matter?" This similar situation may also apply to China, which currently has friendly relations with both Britain and the Soviet Union, just like Poland and Turkey.</p>
<p>(2) Where is the Stumbling Block?</p>
<p>Judging solely from the proposals, counter-proposals, and expressions of the authorities responsible for the negotiations on both sides, it seems that the differences between the two sides have been largely eliminated. What remains as a problem, as the British government said some time ago, is merely a matter of "method and technology." However, if it were really just a few questions, then they would not prevent the concrete establishment of Anglo-Soviet cooperation (now commonly referred to as the Anglo-French-Soviet Three-Power Alliance). The biggest stumbling block now lies outside the so-called "method and technology" issues.</p>
<p>In summary -</p>
<p>The first current stumbling block is the inconsistency in the preparations of both sides for joint decision-making steps. First of all, the establishment of an Anglo-French-Soviet three-power alliance to resist aggression has been accepted in principle by both sides. But what about the joint decision-making steps after the establishment of this alliance? On the British and French side, the preparation is to immediately use this three-power alliance as a background to begin negotiations with Germany and Italy for a final compromise. The intention, of course, is to make considerable concessions. The Soviet Union, however, believes that it would be acting as a "cat's paw" in the Anglo-French bargaining negotiations with Germany and Italy, which is meaningless and dangerous for itself. Its intention is to re-establish a collective security system on this basis, to protect the territorial sovereignty of all countries, to judge existing aggressions, and to resist future ones. But Britain and France believe that this would "endanger peace" and are unwilling to support it. So, what should be done? Currently, a compromise has not yet been found. Therefore, this constitutes one of the current stumbling blocks.</p>
<p>The second current stumbling block is that the two sides have not yet reached a consensus on what constitutes the completion of the alliance. In the distant past, there was the example of Italy in the European War abandoning Germany and joining the Allied powers to seek its own benefit by betraying its ally; more recently, there was the example of French diplomacy at the Munich Conference last year, even though there was a mutual assistance alliance relationship, France still participated in selling out Czechoslovakia. Now, in this environment of complex international relations, the binding force of a blank paper treaty is completely gone. So, if we want to make the alliance relationship truly binding, what should we do? On this point, the recently publicized German-Italian alliance, as well as the German-Italian alliance with Spain that has not yet been publicized, and even the Anglo-French alliance that has been further strengthened recently, offer three good examples. According to these examples, the alliance relationship can only be concretely established after passing through three steps. The steps are: ① the establishment of the alliance on the treaty; ② the negotiations of the general staffs of both sides, followed by the establishment of the general allocation of military strength in which both sides will participate in future operations; ③ the final tacit understanding, mixing the operational forces of the two sides, so that after the war begins, victory is shared, and defeat is also shared, and no country is absolutely allowed to compromise with the enemy first to establish partial peace. Only in this way can it be considered a true "alliance." However, in the current Anglo-French-Soviet alliance, although the British side is declaring that once the Soviet Union agrees to and signs the alliance treaty, the negotiations between the general staffs of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will follow, but as it stands, that is only a formality. The most urgent requirement of Britain and France is still only the signing of the first step of the alliance treaty. This is of course not enough to satisfy the Soviet Union's requirements. Its intention is to implement the above three steps, otherwise, it would be better not to have it at all. Therefore, the Soviet Union recently requested Britain and France to give a guarantee first: in case of war, everyone will not negotiate peace individually. So at this time, the so-called "alliance" in the eyes of Britain and France is very different in degree compared with that in the eyes of the Soviet Union. I think that sooner or later a point of mutual agreement will be found, but at present, this has become the second stumbling block.</p>
<p>The third current stumbling block is due to the difficulty in establishing mutual trust. The line followed by the British Chamberlain cabinet for more than a year has created deep-rooted suspicions on the Soviet side. And this time, suddenly turning around and negotiating cooperation with the Soviet Union, the abruptness of this action will inevitably make it difficult to gain the trust of Soviet Russia in the short term. Although Maisky, the current British ambassador, was summoned back to his country to report on the pro-Soviet attitude of the general British public, and especially the unanimous urging of the government to be pro-Soviet by members of the opposition in Parliament, however, judging from the situation after Maisky's return to office, the Soviet Union's trust in the Chamberlain cabinet is still unimproved. Last week, Foreign Secretary Halifax suggested to Prime Minister Chamberlain that Eden be sent to the Soviet Union to negotiate directly with Stalin and Molotov. This suggestion is still under consideration, and whether it can be realized in the future is of course questionable, and even if it is realized, whether it can take effect is an even bigger question. Also, from the Soviet Russian side, Litvinov, who previously advocated the old collective security system, using the League of Nations as a tool to sanction Germany most forcefully, is no longer on the stage. Molotov, who was replaced, is merely holding a concurrent post, while Stalin himself, in his inclination, undoubtedly attaches importance to the Far East and despises the European situation. The current British government has been circling in two contradictory concerns regarding Soviet Russia all these days; if a complete military alliance is established, they are worried that the Soviet Union will immediately give extra weight to the Far East and no longer share the burden for Europe, otherwise, they are afraid that Stalin will come to a tacit understanding with Hitler, one focusing on the Far East, and the other extorting in Europe. However, this is only a psychological obstacle. If the aforementioned first and second points are resolved, this will not constitute any stumbling block. However, in order to explain the true situation of the current negotiation difficulties, I have also listed it here as the third stumbling block.</p>
<p>The fourth stumbling block is the so-called "guarantee of the independence of the Baltic Sea coastal countries." If Britain and the Soviet Union can reach a consensus on the first and second points, then this point will not be a problem at all. However, at this time, the Soviet Union's proposal of this point is actually giving Britain and France a big problem: the intention is naturally to test whether Britain and France can completely agree with the Soviet Union's point of view on the first and second points. We must remember that the lessons of the past year or so have made some small and weak European countries thoroughly realize two things; one, Britain and France will not care about their interests, and if necessary, they will even give them to Germany and Italy as sacrifices to alleviate the crisis between themselves and Germany and Italy; two, the Soviet Union will not fight alone for them without the participation of Britain and France, at most providing material assistance; and they themselves are not countries that can only rely on assistance to confront Germany and Italy. So, the inevitable conclusion is: if Germany and Italy can automatically not invade them, that would be the most ideal situation; they call this state "absolute neutrality." Now, Hitler has already taken the lead over Britain and France and automatically signed "non-aggression pacts" with them. This not only eliminates their concerns about the invasion of their territorial sovereignty, but also implies to the Soviet Union; the possibility of conflicts between Germany and the Soviet Union on the Soviet Union's western border has now been completely removed. At this time, if Britain and France were to guarantee their security, they would undoubtedly be severely rejected. If they want them to accept the guarantee, there is only one way, and that is to first establish a complete alliance relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union has cleverly regarded it as a major premise for the alliance under the method proposed by Britain and France, which is really a troublesome thing for the British and French authorities.</p>
<p>In the end, everything else is a relatively minor difficulty. The most important thing is still the above-mentioned first and second points. If Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can reach a consensus on these two points, then an alliance relationship can be realized immediately. The realization of this alliance will not only bring peace and prosperity to the contracting countries, but it will also bring light and progress to all mankind. (June 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Kill Fishermen: Hong Kong's Blood Debt: More Than 10,000 Fishermen Killed; Property Loss Exceeds 20 Million</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the Japanese Navy has illegally blockaded the Chinese coastline, causing unprecedented hardship for fishermen along the coast. Since September of the year before last, any fishing boats from Hong Kong engaged in fishing have been intercepted by Japanese warships. The lives of fishermen are not protected, fishing boats are burned, and property on board is looted. These incidents occur almost daily. Initially, some fishing boats accepted the advice of the government authorities and temporarily stopped going to sea during the war. However, as time went on, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of fishermen became a problem. They could not sit idly by and wait for death. Therefore, before long, the fishermen in Hong Kong risked going to sea to work again, disregarding life and death. If they encountered Japanese warships, they tried to escape. If they were captured, they resisted with all their might, and finally sacrificed heroically, creating an unprecedented record of fisherman casualties.</p>
<p>Casualty Statistics</p>
<p>After each incident of Hong Kong fishermen encountering disaster at sea, the survivors reported to the Hong Kong Fishermen's Association. In the past year or so, the association has collected reports from various sources and submitted the fishermen's disasters to the motherland government authorities. According to the latest statistical report released by the association, from September of the year before last to the end of December of last year, a total of 628 Hong Kong fishing boats were burned by Japanese warships in Hong Kong's overseas waters, and 10,092 fishermen were killed. From January to the end of May of this year, within five months, 16 fishing boats were burned and 34 were missing. On average, another 1,205 fishermen were killed. From September of the year before last to the end of May of this year, a total of 644 fishing boats were burned and 11,342 fishermen were killed in 21 months. The above numbers are only based on reports from fishermen and statistical analysis. Others who did not report to the association have not been included. It is estimated that more than 1,000 Hong Kong fishing boats have been burned or missing in the past 21 months, with a total monetary loss of 20 million yuan for the fishermen's boats.</p>
<p>Destruction Process</p>
<p>According to fishermen's reports, the destruction of fishermen by Japanese warships outside Hong Kong can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage was intimidation: whenever fishing boats were working overseas, they were burned. The second stage was to implement a appeasement policy towards fishermen, enticing them with profits, and using bewitchment. The most recent is the third stage, which is to implement a policy of robbery. Therefore, in the past five months, there have been many missing Hong Kong fishing boats. The missing people and boats have been abducted. Only those who escaped returned to report. In addition to robbing property, the children of fishermen are the object of these people. It is found that each fishing boat has an average of six or seven children, most of whom are abducted. It is said that they are given a enslavement education to supplement the strong men in their country.</p>
<p>Induced to Attach to Japan</p>
<p>What is even more heartbreaking is that ignorant fishermen have been induced to attach to Japan. Near Sanmen Customs, some fishermen have been bought by the Japanese side. According to fishermen returning to Hong Kong from Sanmen Customs, some fishermen there have been induced by the Japanese side and have become traitors, forming a group to transport grain for the Japanese side, and are protected by Japanese warships to fish along the coast. If Hong Kong fishing boats sail to that area, they will be burned by Japanese warships. In the past, many fishing boats seized by Japanese warships in various places in Hong Kong waters were also docked there. After receiving the report, the Fishermen's Association, in order to prevent ignorant fishermen from being attracted by the Japanese side, actively advised the fishermen to pay close attention when going out to fish, and not to approach the Sanmen Customs area to avoid misfortune. Most fishermen also realized that fishing in that area was too dangerous and did not dare to go there, and instead fished in Lufeng, Jiazi, Jieshi, Pinghai, and Aotou to avoid robbery.</p>
<p>Planning for Aftermath</p>
<p>The reason why fishermen attach to the Japanese side is due to the difficulty of life, which leads to being tempted by profits. The domestic military and political authorities, in view of this, are carrying out improvements to the lives of fishermen. Recently, the Command Headquarters of the 　th War Zone, in order to investigate the living conditions of residents along the coast of Guangdong and carry out improvements, specially organized the Guangdong Donghai District Fishery and Salt Inspection Group and sent it to various places along the coast for inspection. The group arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago and transferred to Baoan. During its stay in Hong Kong, it investigated everything with the Hong Kong Fishermen's Association. The association provided a lot of reference materials on the living conditions of fishermen and reported in detail the various situations in which illegal public officials extorted money from fishermen, requesting the authorities to thoroughly improve the situation in order to solve the difficulties in the lives of fishermen. The Fishermen's Association also prepared a written report to the authorities, so that they could find ways to improve the situation.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle of Japanese Army Invading Shantou: Sixty to Seventy Japanese Warships Encircle Shantou City; Japanese Army Attacks in Three Routes and is Repelled; As of the Night of the 21st, Street Fighting is Ongoing</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese army's invasion of Shantou has already begun. Earlier, at about 6:00 p.m. on the 20th, the Japanese army moved seven gunboats outside Shantou Port towards the Ma Yu estuary along the coast, covering electric-powered speedboats and attacking in three routes. By 10:00 p.m., Japanese warships from Taiwan, Xiamen, Qiongya, and Guangzhou had gathered outside Shantou Port, as many as sixty or seventy ships. In addition to the large ships, there were also hundreds of speedboats and rubber boats. The naval landing forces and the newly trained field soldiers and swamp soldiers from Taiwan, numbering twenty to thirty thousand, first invaded the North and South ports of Chenghai, which are the outlets of the Han River tributaries. Fierce fighting broke out at about 7:00 p.m. The Chinese army and civilians fought bravely to protect the residents of Waisha and retreat to Zhanglin, Donglong, and Lotus Mountain. By 10:00 p.m., the Japanese army had occupied Caogou Binhai as a foothold. The Chinese army arrived from a certain place and used hand grenades and broadswords to kill all the Japanese soldiers who had landed. Near the Shantou Airport, the Japanese army landed again, and the two sides were entangled until the morning of the 21st. More than two or three hundred corpses were lying on the beach, indistinguishable as Chinese or Japanese, fighting to the death in a pile. Coastal refugees belonging to Chenghai used small boats to cross to nearby Mayu and Aotou, but that area had been rushed into by Japanese speedboats, and some Japanese soldiers had landed and were engaging in battle with the Chinese army in Aotou, Gezhou, and Donghu. The artillery fire was very fierce. The refugees leaned towards the shore, abandoned their boats, climbed mountains, and fled to Jiaoshi to hide. Also, Aotou is twelve miles away from Jiaoshi. The war started at about 7:00 p.m. on the 20th. By 10:00 p.m., the artillery fire had slightly stopped. The Japanese soldiers who landed were repelled three times. This is the middle route of the Japanese army's invasion, mostly Taiwanese troops, carrying new-style automatic rifles, which are very light. At the same time, the Japanese army rushed ashore in hundreds in the areas of Dahao, Haimen, and Hetoutou. The fortifications relied upon by the Chinese army were all destroyed by artillery fire, and they were forced to retreat to Magao and Shalun. The Japanese army gained this foothold and gathered bamboo rafts and sailboats in Haimen Bay to transport heavy weapons ashore, trying to directly approach Chaoyang. Fortunately, the Chinese army had dismantled the highway early and buried more than a hundred landmines. That night, the two armies were in a stalemate in the Haimen area, which was also extremely fierce. The Japanese army used a column of ten armored vehicles as the vanguard. The lights on the vehicles shone on the rugged and uneven silt, and the movement was extremely slow. More than a dozen tanks were detonated by landmines and overturned outside Magao Township. As of 6:00 a.m. on the 21st, the Japanese army on that line had made no progress. However, more than a dozen Japanese speedboats had broken through the Mayu blockade line, firing artillery towards the Jiaoshi coast on one side and sending minesweepers to the entrance to clear obstacles and mines. Several Japanese speedboats carrying soldiers landed in Jinsha Township to attack the Shantou Airport. The airport has been converted into farmland. The two armies then engaged in a bloody battle in the rugged land. Most of the Japanese soldiers who landed were wiped out by the Chinese army. Just as the Chinese army was winning, 15 Japanese planes flew into Shantou City and dropped bombs. From 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on the 21st, Shantou City had turned into street fighting. The Japanese warships cleared the blockade line obstacles, and 20 entered the port, cutting off the traffic between Shantou and Jiaoshi. Outside Mayu estuary, there were several Japanese giant ships blocking the import and export of various ports. The Japanese Navy, commanded by Kondo Akira, invaded the Chenghai, Shantou, and Chaoyang lines. The main force of the Japanese army was the one that advanced along Chenghai, Donglong, and Zhanglin, and the two routes to Chaoyang and Shantou were auxiliary attacks. Shantou City was bombarded by Japanese warships and bombed by planes in turn. The Chinese army and police never retreated. The great war continued until the afternoon of the 21st, and street fighting was still going on. The entire machinery of the electric light factory, the water tower, the current conversion machine room, and other important buildings were all detonated by landmines. The fire and smoke soared into the sky. On the evening of the 21st, the Chinese army and police in the city, seeing that the people had retreated, retreated while covering and fighting. At night, they retreated along the embankment road to Anbu, or to the Sangpu Mountain in Yuepu Pengzhou to plan a guerrilla war. After the Chinese army withdrew from Shantou City, there were still landmines that had not been detonated. The Japanese army, seeing that the Chinese army and civilians were determined to defend to the death, dared not move forward lightly. The Japanese army that invaded from Dahao and Aotou was in a stalemate with the Chinese army and police in Bogongling Tianren Village, and was only separated from Shalun by a Lian River. This battle of the Chinese army was to fight more with less everywhere. They knew that a battle with their backs to the water could not last long, but all the defenders were determined not to retreat a step, so they could support it for a day and night. The Japanese side also thought it was magical.</p>
<p>At present, the Han River water is rising sharply, and the downstream embankments have already become dangerous. The larger Japanese army groups dare not attack Chaoan along the railway, but focus on Chenghai Donglong to bypass and attack Chaoan. A floating combat team composed of speedboats traveled upstream along the Xiangzi Bridge. At this time, the river water was turbulent. The speedboats drove in from Caogou, but they were unable to steer and were sunk by the defending army on the shore for more than ten boats. Although the North and South ports were occupied, the Chinese army also rushed to the scene. There was a bloody battle all day on the 21st. The Japanese tanks, cavalry, etc., in the fields surrounded by floods, were all equal to waste. As of 10:00 p.m. on the 　th, the Chinese police force was still firmly defending Shantou City. The Japanese army that rushed from the airport and the rugged terrain were led by Taiwanese people. Once they entered Zhongshan Road, Waima Road, and Tongji Road, they were immediately attacked by the Chinese army. Jiaoshi was occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese army stationed in Dahao, numbering 700, could not cross to invade Shantou. The Japanese warships in the port requested foreign nationals and foreign ships to evacuate within a time limit, claiming that they would bomb Shantou City to the ground. Therefore, the great war of Shantou is about to begin.</p>
<h3>Under the Active Guerrillas, the Japanese Troops Occupying Shandong are Exhausted, Qingdao's Destroyed Factories are Unable to Recover, and Japanese Bayonets Still Cannot Control the Rural Areas. The Guerrillas are Very Courageous and Have Penetrated Deep into the Provincial Capital.</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that in the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, when the Chinese army withdrew from Shandong Province, they left behind as little as possible for the Japanese to seize. The industrial factories in Qingdao were systematically destroyed, railways were dismantled, and bridges were blown up. However, the Chinese army left behind guerrillas who have been fighting the Japanese in Shandong for over a year. The Chinese policy is to impose a heavy economic burden on the Japanese and to hinder the Japanese reconstruction efforts with guerrilla warfare. The following can be said to be:</p>
<p>Chinese Policy</p>
<p>Successful: (1) The Japanese army has to maintain a huge and costly military defense throughout the province. (2) The guerrillas constantly lure the Japanese army into "mopping-up" operations, consuming even more resources. (3) The Japanese forces are limited to areas marked by bayonets, and the economic resources of the interior are cut off, inaccessible to the Japanese. The Japanese army in North China recently invited foreign visitors to inspect Shandong Province, hoping to show them another side of the situation. What the Japanese wanted the visitors to see was the failure of the Chinese guerrilla strategy, the degree of Sino-Japanese cooperation, the political stability under the current Shandong "Provincial Government", and the economic reconstruction in the year or so since the Japanese occupation. However, the visitors had no opportunity to talk to anyone other than Japanese officials and generals. The following can be said to be the successes of the Japanese activities in Shandong: (1) The Chinese factories in Qingdao and Jinan have been taken over by the Japanese, rebuilt after being destroyed, and put into operation using raw materials obtained in Shandong. (2) The Qingdao Customs is in Japanese hands, and the profits from the factories operated by the Japanese help support the Japanese army in Shandong. This naturally helps prevent the depletion of Japan's economic resources. (3) Despite the active guerrillas, the railways have been rebuilt and are open to traffic. (4) Although the "Provincial Government" does not control the entire Shandong Province and does not have the loyalty of the vast majority of the people, it has become somewhat active. (5) The Chinese guerrillas have no possibility of driving out the Japanese army or the "Provincial Government" under Japanese protection in the short term. However, the guerrillas have made it clear that building a "New Order" is a costly project, and they have greatly troubled the Japanese. Qingdao has been opened up, and foreign ships are allowed to enter. The city is still peaceful and lively. As far as foreigners are concerned, their lives are still comfortable, much like the Germans'. However, trade restrictions are another matter. January 1938.</p>
<p>Occupation of Qingdao</p>
<p>The Japanese Marine Corps, which occupied Qingdao, has its headquarters in the city, and there are Japanese army and special forces stationed there. The Japanese Asia Development Board also has a general office there. Of Qingdao's 160,000 population, the Japanese account for 23,000, and the number increases by 500 or 600 each month, as ships sailing from Japan to Qingdao are full of Japanese. The Japanese industries in Qingdao were destroyed, amounting to 40 million Japanese yen. Although some are being rebuilt, progress is slow due to the lack of capital in Japan. Although the Japanese have occupied Qingdao for more than a year, the Kanegafuchi Spinning Factory, which lost 23 million Japanese yen, has not yet started operation. The Japanese are still planning to restore part of the factory first, but the textile machinery shipped from Japan to Qingdao is old and unusable. One flour mill taken over by the Japanese has been opened, but it cannot obtain wheat from the Yangtze River basin, and wheat produced in Shandong and other North China provinces is also unavailable. According to the Japanese manager of the factory, this is because "there are not enough vehicles on the railways". However, this explanation is not true. It is not that there are not enough vehicles, but that the Japanese bayonets have still</p>
<p>Failed to Control</p>
<p>the rural areas, and Chinese farmers have not yet expressed their willingness to help Japan establish a "New Order" in East Asia with their agricultural products. In order to facilitate the transportation of local products, the Japanese Navy has relaxed its blockade of the Shandong coast and allowed sailboats to travel in the rivers. However, a shipping association has been organized to inspect ships to prevent the smuggling of goods to supply the guerrillas. The 1,000 White Russians in Qingdao have been organized by the Japanese army into an anti-communist federation and used for "spontaneous" demonstrations. The situation outside Qingdao is completely different. The railway lines are heavily guarded. The Japanese claim that the Shandong guerrillas are mostly in Laoshan east of Qingdao and the mountains southeast of Jinan. However, of Shandong's 107 counties, the "Provincial Government" has only appointed 76 county magistrates, and more than one-third of them have not taken office due to "poor health", even though they are receiving their monthly salaries. This shows that Chinese troops are also active in other areas. In May, Japanese planes constantly bombed the Chinese guerrillas near Yantai. Although the news of the clashes in Shandong is not as frequent as in other parts of North China, observers believe that this is because the Japanese army is disturbing a less active "hornet's nest" in the area.</p>
<p>The Jiaoji Railway</p>
<p>is one of the important arteries for transporting local resources to Qingdao. The number of guerrilla attacks on the railway has been greatly reduced this year. Chinese sources say that this is because the guerrillas are taking into consideration the interests of the masses. When a railway line is demolished in a certain area, the Japanese army retaliates against the villagers in that area. The guerrillas understand that this is not in the interests of the farmers, so they have relaxed their activities to destroy the railway. However, these attacks have not completely stopped, as indicated by the heavy Japanese guard on the railway. The section of the line between Fangzi and Zhangdian, about 80 miles long, has guards every few hundred feet. These Japanese guards are stationed in machine gun outposts near the railway, surrounded by barbed wire. At certain intervals, there are simple trenches, with one or two soldiers stationed in them. In some places, new underground bunkers, trenches, and huts are being built. The trees along the railway have been cut down to make it difficult for attackers to find shelter. Armored vehicles, sometimes driven by motors, run in front of the train to prevent the rails from being damaged. In a narrow strip of land five to ten miles wide along the line, the Japanese army has organized 5,000 villagers to help them build a "New Order". The villagers' task is to protect the railway from guerrilla attacks and to warn the Japanese garrison where there are "bandits". Japanese officers expect that the attacks on the railway in Shandong will end this year, but they admit that guerrilla activity will only end when the Chinese resistance ends. According to a Japanese lieutenant general, the Shandong guerrillas have rifles, machine guns, and some field guns, but lack ammunition. The lieutenant general also admitted that the guerrillas are very courageous individually. Their numbers were 90,000 half a year ago, and now they are 20,000. These figures given by the Japanese officer are inevitably somewhat optimistic. According to Chinese and foreign observers, the current number of guerrillas is about the same as it was half a year ago. In terms of guerrilla activity,</p>
<p>the area around Jinan</p>
<p>is one of the most troublesome places for the Japanese army. In the mountains southeast of Jinan, there is a troop led by Admiral Chen, which often launches attacks on the Japanese garrison from its base. On the night of May 16, 600 Chinese troops attacked the Japanese garrison in southeastern Shandong with mortars and machine guns. The Japanese garrison in Jinan had to rush troops to rescue the attacked Japanese garrison. According to the Japanese, the Chinese attack resulted in the Japanese army sending four teams to "mop up" two guerrilla bases. In fact, the guerrillas only moved their headquarters. This is a common policy of the guerrillas. The Japanese army in Jinan is heavily defended. Chinese entering the train station are subject to strict searches. No one is allowed to enter or leave after 10 p.m. However, guerrillas still often</p>
<p>sneak into the city</p>
<p>to buy and sell, and sometimes engage in anti-Japanese activities. Several officials of the "Provincial Government" have been assassinated in this provincial capital controlled by the Japanese. Japanese trucks often speed through the streets and alleys. The Japanese investment in Jinan is not as large as in Qingdao, and most of the establishments are taverns and geisha houses. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese army in Shandong began to attack the coast, the Hua army and guerrillas of the 113th and 114th divisions between Longhai Road, Jinpu Road, and Jiaoji Road totaling more than 100,000 people. The Japanese authorities in Beiping said that their purpose was to disperse these "anti-Japanese elements" and gain control of the cotton and peanut producing areas. At the same time, other Chinese troops are attacking south of Yantai in an attempt to "mop up" what the Japanese call the "New Order". All of the above is a general picture of the current situation in Shandong.</p>
<h3>The Commander of the Puppet Imperial Collaboration Army Corps, Ge Chongshou, Captured.</h3>
<p>Has been escorted to a certain place by the Magistrate of Funing County. According to his confession, the inside story of the puppet army organization.</p>
<p>Funing Correspondence: Zhang Yihui, a puppet soldier in Funing, recently revolted and cooperated with the regular army of the Chinese county to destroy the nest of the Japanese and puppet troops at Shangjiuhe. In addition to obtaining guns and spoils of war, he also captured Ge Chongshou, the commander of the puppet imperial collaboration army column, on the spot. Magistrate Xiong sent someone to escort him to a certain place on the 16th. According to Ge Chongshou, he is 46 years old, from Changping, Hebei. He worked in the military in his early years and served as an intelligence officer in Song Zheyuan's army. Last year, he was detained in Beiping Prison for a case. He was taken out by the Japanese army, appointed as the commander of the column, and given more than 100 bandit soldiers to command. The Japanese army often sent people to monitor his regimental headquarters. They usually did not provide rations and ordered him to rob the people to support himself. Most of the guns were also extorted from the people. He was captured by Zhang Yihui (the captain of his unit). According to reports, Ge Chongshou is a black man with a pockmarked face. His clothes are also very tattered and he looks very embarrassed.</p>

<h3>Various Industries are Striving to Promote the System of Drawing and Remitting Notes. Financial Industry Requests Chinese and Foreign Banks to Accept it. The Discount on Remittance Drawings will be Strictly Prohibited.</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance sent telegrams to Shanghai, the silver and money industries have complied with the regulations, and the financial market has stabilized. The tide of withdrawals has also subsided. Various industries are discussing the promotion of the remittance system, which must be jointly accepted by Chinese and foreign banks. In order to eliminate speculation, the discount on remittance drawings must be prohibited. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Market is Calm</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance's telegram stipulated the new method of withdrawal in Shanghai, in the first one or two days of implementation, due to the fact that all sectors of society did not fully understand the truth, it caused considerable fluctuations. However, this fluctuation has subsided. Because in addition to those engaged in speculative business, ordinary citizens can withdraw 2,000 yuan per month, and do not feel any inconvenience. As for the industrial and commercial sectors, in addition to the payment of wages, separate applications are not restricted. The system of drawing notes has been quite effective since its implementation.</p>
<p>Remittance System</p>
<p>The reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from various industries yesterday that they have been discussing in recent days how to promote the system of drawing and remitting notes to replace legal tender, and considerable results have been obtained. Because the Ningbo people occupy a considerable force in Shanghai's commerce, and the Ningbo market also adopts the remittance system (the so-called transfer of accounts in foreign currency) without paying legal tender, it does not hinder the development of commerce. However, this remittance note must be jointly accepted by Chinese and foreign banks in order to circulate. This matter is under consideration by Zheng Jun in the financial industry, and there will be considerable resolution in the near future.</p>
<p>Withdrawals Subside</p>
<p>In the banking sector, in the week before the promulgation of the Ministry of Finance's regulations, deposits were withdrawn due to speculative influences. After the promulgation and implementation of the Ministry of Finance's regulations, the situation changed drastically. It is reported that the ratio of income to withdrawals of major banks on the 22nd was about 1:9, which changed to 2:8 on the 23rd, and to 3:7 on the morning of the 24th. Because people's hearts have calmed down, those who withdrew earlier are now depositing again. It is expected that the situation will be even better after today, because all sectors of society have a deep understanding of the government's painstaking efforts to prevent the outflow of funds.</p>
<p>Prohibiting Discounts</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the remittance system, with Shanghai's large population, the daily necessities all need to be paid in legal tender, the supply of remittance drawings is greater than the demand, and the demand for drawing heads is greater than the supply. Thus, speculative discounts on remittance drawings have been created. Fortunately, with the maintenance of the Banking Preparation Committee entrusted by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and the maximum supply to the industry, the situation has been turned from danger to safety. Now, in addition to striving to promote the system of drawing and remitting notes, if the discount on remittance drawings exists, it is not in line with the wartime financial policy set by the Ministry. In order to eliminate speculative manipulation, the discount on remittance drawings must be prohibited.</p>
<p>Considering Methods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to various financial institutions requesting the prohibition of discounts on remittance notes. At the same time, the Silver and Money Industry Associations, in view of this and for the sake of stabilizing finance, have notified member banks and firms to strictly restrict the payment of remittance notes, so that finance can maintain a normal state. The Ministry of Finance has also sent a telegram instructing strict prohibition, but in fact, the practice of remittance discounts still exists. Those who engage in this speculative discount are general small money exchange shops, while formal banks and remittance money shops do not engage in this discount business. Now the financial industry is considering the prohibition of discounts.</p>
<h3>The Fall of Dinghai City, Regiment Police Guarding Qingling, County Government Authorities Had Arrangements in Advance, Various Places in Eastern Zhejiang Have Been Repeatedly Bombed.</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army forcibly landed on the Zhoushan Islands in eastern Zhejiang, the local self-defense corps and police have offered fierce resistance. Unfortunately, Shenjiamen and Dinghai County City have fallen one after another, and local order is very chaotic. The self-defense corps have all retreated to the nearby mountains to wage guerrilla warfare. However, Ningbo is as peaceful as ever. Telecommunications from De Ping and Moufu have arrived in Ningbo one after another. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dinghai Shenjiamen has fallen</p>
<p>The Zhoushan Islands are sea islands outside the Zhenhai Estuary in eastern Zhejiang. They are salt-producing and fishing areas, and are not militarily important, so there are no regular troops stationed there. The Japanese army had previously occupied the islands of Qushan and Daishan in order to plunder salt and maintain its fishing plan. It has been a month now. Today, suddenly at 5:00 a.m. on the 23rd, under the cover of planes, Japanese warships bombed Dinghai, Shenjiamen, and other places, and then forcibly landed. The local self-defense corps and police offered constant resistance, but due to their numerical inferiority, they made heroic sacrifices. Unfortunately, Dinghai and Shenjiamen have fallen one after another, and the guards have been forced to retreat into the mountains to wage guerrilla warfare. Local order cannot be maintained, and a large fire broke out in the Dongyue Temple area.</p>
<p>Qingling Area Preparing for Fierce Battle</p>
<p>Shenjiamen is the only important town southeast of Dinghai and is the base of the fishing industry in the Zhoushan Islands. It is 80 li from the county seat and unfortunately fell first. Therefore, the landing troops immediately attacked Dinghai County City, and later the county city also fell one after another. County Magistrate Su Benshan has led the police and guards of the entire county to retreat through the North Gate to the deep mountains of Qingling to reorganize all the troops and implement guerrilla warfare, attacking the landing Japanese army at any time. As for the local situation, according to the Gaudens of the German company Ruilin Foreign Company, who telegraphed from Shipu to Shanghai yesterday, mentioning that Shenjiamen Dinghai had fallen and the local situation was chaotic, it was also heard that residents had been ordered to retreat into the deep mountains. The Dinghai no-money radio station was originally located in the police station. Since the fall of Dinghai, telecommunications have been completely cut off. It is heard that Dinghai County City and Shenjiamen are both places with densely packed shops, which are not conducive to defense. However, the area around Qingling outside the North Gate is full of towering mountains. The county government authorities had arrangements in advance, so the war will be seen to be carried out on the ridge.</p>
<p>Strict Precautions in Putuo and Other Places</p>
<p>The state of local order in Dinghai, because the radio has been cut off, so the truth cannot be clarified for a while. However, the Gaudens of the German company Ruilin Foreign Company and the Tianbao of the German company Schimidt Foreign Company, which operate between Ningbo and Dinghai, have stopped entering Dinghai. As for the small steamers from Dinghai to Shenjiamen, they have also stopped. The sailboats that sail to the inner harbor, including Chuanshan, Shipu, Ninghai, and Sanmen Bay, have also stopped sailing. In addition, the police sent by Dinghai County still maintain order on islands such as Putuo Mountain, and are on strict alert. If the Japanese army attempts to land, they will be severely attacked. It is heard that some residents of Dinghai have taken refuge in Putuo Mountain.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Fully Building Naval Port</p>
<p>It is found that the Zhoushan Islands are composed of islands of various sizes such as Dinghai Island, Hengdao Island, Daishan Island, Changtu Island, and Taohua Island. They control the Baka Islands and the Ma'an Islands in the north, and the Feishan Islands in the south. They have various ports such as Xiangshanpu and Dinghai Island, and are rich in fisheries. Most of the residents are engaged in fishing. The Japanese side first occupied Daishan, and now they continue to land in Shenjiamen Dinghai. Their purpose is to plunder fisheries and to build a naval port there. Therefore, the significance of their landing is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Various Places in Eastern Zhejiang Were Bombed Again</p>
<p>According to news from the navigation industry, various places in eastern Zhejiang have been repeatedly harassed by Japanese planes. The situations are as follows: (1) Twelve Japanese planes invaded Zhenhai at 1:00 p.m. on the 23rd and dropped 60 bombs on the Jiangnan Xiaojiang, destroying more than 100 houses. At 4:00 p.m., another Japanese plane flew to Fanshi Town and dropped two bombs, destroying five houses. (2) Guanhaiwei in northern Cibei was also bombed by Japanese planes on the same morning, dropping ten bombs, destroying more than 50 houses, killing 13 people and injuring 35. (3) In the Longshan area in northern Zhenhai, two Japanese planes also dropped many bombs on the 23rd, destroying more than ten houses and injuring three civilians. (4) In the Xiangshan area, three Japanese planes invaded on the morning of the 22nd and bombed Nanmen Yangxing Street and other places. A certain middle school in western Xiangshan was bombed and destroyed seven or eight school buildings, killing and injuring several civilians.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Burn and Pillage Qushan Fishing Boats</p>
<p>Qushan Wufeng Fish Stack and others hired 500 pieces of yellow croaker to be shipped from Qushan to Shaoxing. On the way, passing near Dongshajiao Dongkenshan, they were detained by Japanese warships. After inspection, the fish were robbed and moved to the old site of the Bank of Communications warehouse in Dongshajiao for storage. Then the salted duck egg boat was burned to the ground, with losses estimated at 50,000 yuan. In addition, a civilian boat was set on fire by a Japanese warship off Zhitoushan Yangmian in Zhenhai a few days ago. Six compatriots were rescued by a coal ship and fled in distress to the Zhinan Township Office, requesting relief.</p>
<p>Ningding Both Hometown Associations Anxious</p>
<p>Since receiving the unfortunate news of Dinghai, the Ningbo Shanghai Hometown Association has been very concerned. A telegram has been sent to the local area to inquire about the truth, but no reply has been received. At the same time, the Dinghai Hometown Association has also telegraphed Dinghai to inquire about the situation, but no reply has been received. It is thought that all government agencies have been evacuated.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industries Decide on Methods to Stabilize the Market. The Preparation Committee Will Handle the Collection and Use of Interbank Remittances. The Total Amount is Provisionally Set at 50 Million Yuan, Registration to Begin Today.</h3>
<p>This newspaper's Chongqing telegram on the 25th: According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, the ministry's decision to restrict the method of withdrawal and deposit in Shanghai was based on the fact that the trend of withdrawing deposits and buying foreign exchange in Shanghai has been very strong recently. In order to stabilize finance, the temporary emergency measures mentioned above were taken. It is still hoped that the market will return to its original state in the short term. When the situation is considered, the aforementioned methods will be cancelled immediately. Therefore, it has been stated in the original order that it is a temporary method. The method of stabilizing finance announced on August 15, 1937, has also been telegraphed by the ministry to continue to be effective.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting the method of withdrawal and deposit in Shanghai, the silver and money industries have been discussing and requesting the Ministry of Finance to fully support legal tender in order to cope with the situation. The reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency has learned from the Silver and Money Industry Association that there are four methods to stabilize the market:</p>
<p>1.  All remittance deposits in the Bank Industry Joint Preparation Committee and the Money Industry Preparation Bank by various banks, money shops, and other financial institutions as of June 30, 1939, totaling 22 million yuan, will be allowed to be exchanged for legal tender by the Preparation Committee at 95 percent.</p>
<p>2.  The legal tender converted from the aforementioned remittance deposits will be paid in twelve weeks starting from July 4, 1939. Each bank and firm will withdraw up to one-twelfth per week. However, if the balance of each bank and firm is less than 10,000 yuan, and the bank and firm needs to withdraw in advance in order to cope with deposits, the Preparation Committee may酌determine the amount to be paid in advance after verification.</p>
<p>3.  Starting from July 4, 1939, the Preparation Committee will begin to handle the collection and use of interbank remittances by various banks and firms. Each bank and firm may provide collateral to apply to the Preparation Committee for the collection and use of interbank remittances. The method of collection and use will be determined separately.</p>
<p>4.  This method has been resolved and implemented by the joint meeting of the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Associations, and it is understood that this method refers to the balance of interbank remittance deposits of various banks and money shops in the Bank Preparation Committee and the Money Industry Preparation Bank. All external remittance deposits of various banks and firms will continue to be handled as before. It is also heard that the Preparation Committee will handle the collection and use of interbank remittances by various banks and firms, with a total amount provisionally set at 50 million yuan, and registration will begin today.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Selling Off by Hoarders, Rice Supply Exceeds Demand, Concession Management Committee to Meet Tomorrow, Steady Source of Supply for Days, People's Hearts Greatly Stabilized</h3>
<p>The rice problem in this city, since the concession authorities repeatedly resolved to convene rice industry leaders to discuss price limits, now the market transactions are being handled in accordance with the price limits stipulated by the authorities, so the market order was restored yesterday, rice prices stabilized, the concession authorities, are paying close attention to the rice problem, and are doing their best to dredge sources and curb rising prices within the possible scope, but sources from various places have not yet been seen to be smooth, the 13th survey of stored rice will be released today, now a detailed account is given as follows,</p>
<p>Order Restored</p>
<p>The rise in rice prices in Shanghai had been soaring recently, presenting a phenomenon rarely seen in history. It is reported that the reason for its sharp rise is nothing more than hoarding manipulation, intentionally waiting and seeing. After the Bureau of Public Works repeatedly resolved to convene rice industry leaders to discuss rice price limits and stabilize market order, now, in the rice market, in addition to the top-grade white rice being traded in accordance with the price limits stipulated by the authorities, the middle and second-grade rice have been publicly agreed upon by the rice industry groups to set standard prices. The rice market opened at 9:00 am and closed at 12:00 noon yesterday, order was restored, rice prices stabilized, and all transactions were in accordance with the newly set price limits, people's hearts were more stable than before, and a total of 7,340 bags were traded in the morning,</p>
<p>Supply Exceeds Demand</p>
<p>Since these days, the weather has gradually become hot, the season of the Yellow Plum has arrived, and it is difficult to store the huge amount of white rice stored in the rice warehouses for a long time. Because rice prices were rising the day before yesterday, large households firmly refused to sell, rice prices were still expected to rise, and they planned to make huge profits. Now all rice prices in the market have been limited by the authorities. Seeing this situation, large households have sold in large quantities to avoid rotting and insects, so the spot chips in the market have suddenly become sufficient. Also, because of the shortage of legal tender, and the delivery of buying and selling transactions are mainly in cash, transactions are therefore sluggish, and the current situation is that supply exceeds demand. The prices of all grades of rice are lower than the limit price, averaging a drop of two or three corners,</p>
<p>Authorities Watching</p>
<p>The two concession authorities are very concerned about the food problem of the people in the concession. They had previously dispatched detectives to rush to the rice market to interfere with those who manipulated and disturbed the market order, and intentionally spread rumors to raise market prices. After the foreign exchange plummeted, unscrupulous rice merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. The two concession authorities, in view of the continued rise in prices of all goods, the lives of citizens have been unable to bear the burden, if rice prices rise again, the impact on the lives of ordinary people is indeed not small. Therefore, they have repeatedly convened representatives of the rice industry to discuss countermeasures, and now a new price limit for the rice market has been set. However, the two concession authorities are still deeply concerned about the market transaction order. Now the Concession Rice and Grain Management Committee has decided to convene a management committee meeting at 2:00 pm tomorrow (Tuesday). It is heard that the dredging of the source of national rice and the stabilization of the market rice price will be discussed at that time,</p>
<p>Rice Storage Survey</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association is responsible for investigating rice storage. Now the thirteenth phase has ended yesterday and will be released by the association today. According to rice industry sources, although the rice storage in this city has slightly decreased due to the reduction of sources, it is still extremely abundant. The number of rice stored in various rice warehouses is more than 523,000 bags, and the total number of rice purchased and hoarded by rice shops and citizens is also around 560,000 bags, so there is no need to worry about the food supply in this city,</p>
<p>Steady Source of Supply</p>
<p>After the vendors from various rice-producing areas have made every effort to purchase rice in recent days, the national rice transported to Shanghai has gradually increased. The amount of goods arriving every day has increased compared to before. On the 24th, the amount of goods arriving by water and land was 8,000 bags. On the 25th, it was also estimated to be 5,600 bags. Yesterday, more than 2,000 dan were transported by water and land. As for rice industry transactions, whether it is the market or the Rong Gang, they are all paid in cash as usual. It has been resolved and passed by the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, and announced that the market will comply with it uniformly,</p>
<p>Detained Ships Released</p>
<p>After the rice purchased by cargo owners from various places and rice merchants in Shanghai from the producing areas and transported to Shanghai was detained in Minhang and other places, it caused anxiety about the source of supply in the market and caused a surge in prices. According to people in the rice industry, the number of detained rice ships reached more than 30. Now, after the cargo owners have dredged various parties and paid various donations and taxes, eight or nine ships have been released to Shanghai. More than 20 ships will continue to arrive in the coming days, so rice ships coming to Shanghai in the future can be opened in as usual, and the incidents of being blocked can be expected to decrease,</p>
<h3>Securities Black Market Opens Today, There is a Way to Unified Debt Principal and Interest to be Repaid, The Revival Public Debt Will Be Drawn as Usual on July 10</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has always been consistent in maintaining credit. There are considerable measures for the principal and interest payable on the five types of debt instruments, namely A, B, C, D, and E, of the unified public debt that expires on July 31. The Ministry of Finance will announce it at that time. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has approved the seventh principal repayment lottery of the Revival Public Debt guaranteed by customs duties to be held on July 10. As for the securities black market in Shanghai, it was temporarily suspended for two and a half days from the afternoon of the 22nd due to uncleared deliveries and restrictions on deposits and withdrawals. It is planned to open the market from today (Monday). However, it is expected that after the market opens, transactions will inevitably decrease sharply. The market lacks cash, making it difficult for speculators to manipulate,</p>
<h3>Sino-French Loan Established, Assisting Southwest Construction, France Will Transport Railway Materials to China, Rogers to London Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (the 24th) this port received news from Hong Kong that the French government's loan to China was formally completed on June 23 after a long period of negotiations. The amount is 1.5 million pounds in British gold. The main purpose of the loan is not yet known in detail. However, according to various well-informed circles in Hong Kong, the nature of the loan granted by the French government to China is the same as the export credit loan granted by the former British government to China. Therefore, France will transport various materials needed to build railways and highways connecting the southwestern provinces with French Vietnam to China in the future. All circles of Chinese in Hong Kong regard the establishment of the Sino-French loan as another clear proof of the French government's foresight. It is heard that the French Ambassador to China, Gossner, has been instrumental in the early conclusion of this loan. Yesterday it was rumored that Sir Leith-Ross will come to China again soon.</p>
<p>The official did not verify this. However, according to well-informed circles in Hong Kong, Rogers, chairman of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, will go to London within two weeks. It is likely that he will return to Hong Kong with Sir Leith-Ross. If there is not enough time, Rogers' trip to Chongqing will be cancelled,</p>
<h3>Safety Movement Achieves Great Results</h3>
<p>Incidents in One Week Decreased Significantly Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Safety Movement Propaganda Week ended on Saturday night last week. Its results were far beyond expectations. According to news released by four radio stations broadcasting in English, the number of incidents on various roads during the week decreased by more than 30% compared to the same week last year. According to the broadcaster, this is entirely due to the universal education movement that has achieved such good results. The statisticians of the Bureau of Public Works were still compiling figures yesterday (the 24th) and waiting for reports of road incidents from various police stations. However, it is said that the number of various road incidents during the Safety Movement Propaganda Week was reduced by 50% compared to the week of June 18, 1938. Mr. Mikkelsen, Chairman of the Bureau of Public Works, delivered a speech on the broadcasting station to thank the residents of the concession and the staff of the Bureau of Public Works for their active assistance. Other speakers urged the citizens not to forget the lessons learned this week and continue to work hard to benefit society in the future,</p>
<h3>The French Municipal Council Provides Financial Support to Employees, Salaries Increased Across the Board, Calculated from June 1, Implemented After Approval by the Council Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (the 23rd) it was heard from reliable sources that the French Concession Municipal Council, due to the recent drop in foreign exchange and the high cost of living, in order to compensate the service personnel in the bureau, is planning to increase the salaries and foreign exchange allowances of all employees (French, Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese). It is expected that it will be implemented from June 1 after being approved by the French Municipal Council Members today (the 24th) or Monday. The teachers of the Municipal Council Academy will also be</p>
<p>Included in the Salary Increase</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's plan to adjust salaries and implement it from June 1 was confirmed yesterday by a senior official of the Municipal Council. However, the official did not know how much the employees' salaries would be increased. It is said that the percentage increase has been drafted, but it still needs to be approved by the Council Members. It is heard that the plan submitted to the Municipal Council is that the basic salary of European employees below 700 yuan per month will be increased by 30%, and those below 700 yuan will be increased by 25%,</p>
<p>Chinese and Vietnamese Police</p>
<p>Including police officers, will be increased by 20%, and a rice allowance of 1.5 yuan per month. It is also heard that European employees will also be given child and housing allowances. The employees of the French Municipal Council were happily waiting for the official announcement of the salary increase yesterday to cope with the high cost of living, but no one knew exactly how much it would be increased, and they were only guessing. Monday, it is expected to be</p>
<p>Officially Announced</p>
<p>In addition, the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works Establishment Committee, in view of the decline in foreign exchange, will meet at the end of the month to discuss the adjustment fee to be given to employees. Although no official news has been released so far, it is heard that the adjustment fee will indeed be issued, which is true for "B" grade employees, because the salaries of "B" grade employees are not paid in foreign currency like "A" grade employees,</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Shantou Flights Resumed</h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Carry Passengers and Goods as Usual</p>
<p>Japanese troops landed in Shantou, and fighting broke out. Flights between Shanghai and Shantou were once blocked. According to news from the shipping industry, the Jinan, a British merchant ship of the Taikoo Company that runs between Shanghai and Shantou, safely arrived in Shantou under the protection of a British warship on the morning of the 23rd and unloaded cargo. The Fusheng of Jardine Matheson arrived in Shantou from Shanghai on the 24th, safely entering the port. The Yisheng arrived on the morning of the 25th. Now the Shanghai-Shantou flights of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have been officially resumed, carrying passengers and goods. The Chunsheng of Jardine Matheson is scheduled to depart tomorrow, and the Risheng and Taiyuan are scheduled to depart for Shantou and Hong Kong on the 28th,</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Tianjin Passenger and Freight Transportation Resumed</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Concession has been blockaded by the Japanese army for more than ten days. Flights between Shanghai and Tianjin have once been suspended, ending at Tanggu. According to news from the shipping industry, the Yongsheng and other ships that departed from Shanghai to Tianjin have all arrived in Tianjin safely without being detained. The British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have sent ships to resume Tianjin flights. Today, the Chunsheng of Jardine Matheson and the Shengjing of Taikoo Company are departing for Tianjin,</p>

<h3>XINGHUA, QUANZHOU, XIANGYU AND NEARBY PORTS OPENING UP NEW ROUTES FOR FOREIGN SHIPPING, JAPANESE USE MILITARY REASONS TO DEMAND PERMITS FROM THE ARMY AND NAVY, FOREIGN SHIPPING UNWILLING TO APPLY AND CHANGING NAMES AND ROUTES</h3>
<p>The ports of Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Xiangyu along the coast of Fujian Province produce a large amount of local sugar and longan, which have always belonged to inland ports, and foreign ships are not allowed to transport them. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War,</p>
<p>Chinese Merchant Ships</p>
<p>Stopped sailing, and foreign ships took the opportunity to sail. The local government, in order to connect products, also gave understanding. Therefore, for a year, foreign ships have exclusively enjoyed the benefits. The goods transported are mainly flour, miscellaneous grains, and oil cakes. The exports are</p>
<p>Longan and Local Sugar</p>
<p>The number is considerable. Unexpectedly, from the first of this month, the Japanese army, under the pretext of the military period, said that the above-mentioned three ports must not be sailed without the permission of the Japanese army and navy. The Japanese tax official of the customs also issued a notice, and the situation has been recorded in the previous report. Until now,</p>
<p>It has been more than Two Sentences</p>
<p>Foreign ships are unwilling to apply for permits, and would rather sacrifice and stop sailing. However, local business circles and Shanghai-based customer gangs have repeatedly decided to discuss how to find ways to connect. Now it is heard that Taikoo Company, in order to meet the needs of customers, plans to open up new routes nearby. It has now been decided to</p>
<p>Send Liangzhou Transport</p>
<p>To Xiudu (Suido) (transliteration) on the morning of the 28th, "the place is near Quanzhou", and send Niuzhuang to Linqiu (Lineju) (transliteration) at the same time, "(the place is near Xiangyu)", and Sanjiang (the place is near Xinghua) and Wenzhou and other places. Yesterday, customers were notified to undertake goods,</p>
<h3>HSBC Enters Dock for Repairs</h3>
<p>Shipowners to Report Incident in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Norwegian vessel HSBC, chartered by the Fufeng Shipping Company on Jiangxi Road in this city, loaded flour, soap, groceries, etc. from Shanghai on the 20th and sailed directly to Zizhulin, Tianjin. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 pm on the 22nd, it encountered fog on the ocean near Weihaiwei, causing it to be heavily damaged by the Japanese vessel Kaiun Maru. Fortunately, the Japanese vessel, together with another Japanese vessel, Kangrui Maru, jointly rescued it, plugging the leak in the first cabin and removing a portion of the heavy cargo and throwing it into the sea, so the hull was spared from sinking, and all the crew members were safe. According to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency who inquired from Fufeng Shipping Company yesterday, after the ship was towed to Yantai, all the cargo had been unloaded, and it had entered the dock for repairs yesterday. All the shipowners and crew members are scheduled to take a ship to Shanghai in the coming days and report the truth of the incident to the Norwegian Consulate General and the company, so as to study the issue of responsibility and conduct negotiations for compensation,</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rubber Industry Gradually Turning for the Better</h3>
<p>Eleven Factories in Operation</p>
<p>Before the war, there were more than 50 domestic rubber factories. Since the outbreak of the war, most of them have fallen into the war zone, so only eight factories, including Dachina, Yisheng, Jiaotong, Hongda, Yongqin, Yuanyuan, Wuhua, and Likang, are in operation. However, due to the interruption of sales in the mainland and other places, they are all maintaining production by reducing work. This year, due to the gradual prosperity of sales in Nanyang, South China, and Northwest China, various factories have also increased production. At the same time, several new factories have started operation in summer, including Guotai on Bailinan Road, Huafeng Factory on Kangjiaqiao Nandunxin Road, etc. In total, there are eleven factories in operation in the city, only one-quarter of the pre-war number,</p>
<h3>Elite Chinese Troops Along the SUJIA Road Are Being Replaced, The 62nd and 63rd Divisions Return to the Rear, The 103rd Division and the 35th Brigade Take Over</h3>
<p>It is reported that there are six divisions and more than 100,000 men of the regular Chinese army mobile force, which are crossing the Qiantang River from the source and entering the rear of the Japanese army in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road and Sujia Road areas. It is said that they have gained strong strongholds and are waiting for an opportunity to attack. It is now heard that two divisions, which have been fighting for a long time, have been ordered to be replaced, one is the Tao Lou troops of the 62nd Division, and the other is the Tan Jingguo troops of the 63rd Division. They are moving quickly and crossing south of the Qiantang River. The two divisions have been active on the border between Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, Suzhou, and Zhejiang for a year, repeatedly resolving to attack Japanese strongholds and building extraordinary achievements. Therefore, they have returned to the rear for rest and replenishment in accordance with wartime operations. The vacated defense areas have been transferred by the Chinese military authorities to two new forces, the 103rd Division and the 45th Independent Brigade, which have crossed north of the Qiantang River and have completed the takeover,</p>
<h3>Japanese Headquarters Announces the Total Number of Japanese Troops in China, Japan's Domestic Military Strength is Exceptionally Thin, All Defense Forces are Only Three Divisions</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily on the 25th, according to the Japanese headquarters, the distribution of Japanese troops in China is roughly as follows: (North China) 15 divisions (South China) 3 divisions (Central China) 15 divisions (Northeast China) 15 divisions</p>
<p>According to the strength of each Japanese division, which is 25,000 men, the military strength in China has reached more than one million men. In addition, it is heard that there are still three to four divisions in Japan, which are used to prevent rebellion. It can be seen that this military strength is the highest power of Japan. Although Japan still has some manpower that can be mobilized, this manpower is neither well-trained nor has sufficient military equipment to enable them to be organized into an army. From this point of view, the Japanese army, at best, is only 50 or 52 divisions. It is truly unwise to wage a widespread war against China, and they have now deeply felt it,</p>
<h3>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Broadcasts to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing and Others Initiate and Organize Events on the 1st and 2nd of Next Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital has been established for 21 years, and its achievements are remarkable. Over the years, it has saved countless lives of ordinary people. Since the August 13th Shanghai Battle, most of the epidemic hospitals in this port have been suspended due to location reasons. The hospital has been able to preserve and continue to serve the community because it is located in the central area. However, it is the only survivor, and its workload is far beyond the original calculation. According to the number of people treated last year, it reached 95,600 people, so the organizers have spent a lot of effort on the funding. This year is already the summer season, and the number of residents in the concession is increasing. If there is an epidemic, the situation may be serious. At this extraordinary time, it is difficult to raise funds for medicines, and prices are rising, requiring a lot of money. The people of Shanghai are deeply worried about this. Now, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lvdeng, Jin Tingsun and other five gentlemen, in view of this, have initiated an invitation to famous opera performers, famous actors, and famous flowers to broadcast all day and night at the Guohua Radio Station on July 1st and 2nd to raise funds from all walks of life, and have sent letters to Zhang Shankun, Fan Hengde, Gu Zhuxuan, Dong Yong, and Chen Yuelou as sponsors. The radio station work is hosted by Yuan Senzhai, Sun Lanting, Bao Xiaodie, Wang Qijun, Zhang Zhongyuan and other ticket-holders. At that time, the entire Shanghai national opera community will participate. It is hoped that all walks of life will promote elegance, order songs at will, help those in need, and donate generously, which is the supreme merit,</p>
<h3>Customs Brokerage Industry Tightens Expenses</h3>
<p>Adding Additional Expenses for Entertaining Customer Gangs Has Been Understood After Discussion</p>
<p>The business of the customs brokerage is to act as an agent for customers, handling import and export goods, transportation, customs declaration, payment of taxes, and other procedures. The business is prosperous. The industry is divided into three groups: Beiyang, South China (divided into Chao Gang and Guang Gang), and Yangtze River. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it has been completely suspended. The North and South Ocean groups can still maintain, but the customs brokerages with larger scales have branches in various ports, and the customer gangs are attached to them. The customs brokerages provide food and lodging and writing rooms, and charge the lowest room and board fees. The customs brokerages give preferential treatment to the customer gangs, because the customers who live in the customs brokerages have priority in handling customs declaration, transportation, and other procedures for the goods they purchase. Both parties make use of each other. Since the outbreak of the war, the cost of living on the isolated island has gradually increased, such as electricity bills, water bills, and rents, which have been increased repeatedly. The customs brokerages, for emotional reasons, still follow the old example for the affiliated customer gangs, so the losses are huge. However, recently, due to the impact of the first order shrinking, prices have suddenly soared, and various industries have raised prices. The customs brokerages are afraid that it will be difficult to support the current situation if they still charge the same meal and room fees for the customer gangs. Therefore, the customs brokerages of the Beiyang group, such as Litaichang, Xinshengchang, Dongyuegong, Beihengmao, Chengxinchang, Yongchangtai, Xinji, Yongfengli, Yuancheng, etc., have decided to increase the room and board fees and electricity fees of the customer gangs from the first of next month to make up for the losses. In addition to the announcement, they also discussed with the customer gangs, and the customer gangs also understood the difficult times and have understood,</p>
<h3>Asian Cultural Association Receives Enthusiastic Donations</h3>
<p>Already Raised 10,000 Yuan, The Future is Very Optimistic</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that the local Asian Cultural Association has recently been in financial difficulties, with heavy debts, and it is difficult to maintain. It has appealed to the public to donate for emergency relief. In recent days, donors have been enthusiastic. An anonymous person donated 2,000 yuan, and the Yizhong Tobacco Leather Company donated 1,000 yuan. So far, more than 11,000 yuan has been donated. Although it is not possible to repay all debts in one fell swoop, the association is quite optimistic about the future. The association has a library and a museum, which greatly benefit the academic community. The association is not only the oldest cultural organization founded by foreigners in China, but also the only one in the Shanghai Public Concession, so the citizens deserve to give it full assistance,</p>
<h3>Amateur Art Writers Association Prepares for Public Exhibition</h3>
<p>Proceeds from Sales to Be Used for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Youth Amateur Art Writers Association, in order to promote the art movement, is actively preparing for the first public exhibition. It has collected many masterpieces, including Western paintings, Chinese paintings, architectural paintings, fan paintings, calligraphy, etc. Mao Xin Yi, Jin Zutong and other gentlemen of the association are responsible for preparing everything. The address is the entire Xiuzhou Bookstore at No. 33 Seymour Road. It is being speeded up and will be opened to the public soon. It is also heard that the association will use the proceeds from all sales to provide relief to refugees,</p>
<h3>Tranquil and Unstained Mind - A Visit with Mr. Wen Lanting</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>Just past the Dragon Boat Festival, still in the season of the Yellow Plum rains, the weather is already scorchingly hot, no different from midsummer. On the morning of the 24th, I got into a car, its rubber tires speeding along the melting asphalt, arriving at a densely wooded area in western Shanghai. I saw many emerald green parasol trees by the roadside, bravely struggling against the intense sunlight. Getting out of the car, I realized that the stuffy air inside was not as refreshing as walking.</p>
<p>I had arranged a meeting with Mr. Wen Lanting beforehand. I presented my card and went upstairs to Mr. Wen's elegant guest room. Mr. Wen greeted me with humility, and in an instant, without thinking, I felt as if I were in Chairman Lin's private residence on Shibanqiao in Nanjing. Taking advantage of the time before the conversation began, I was filled with recollections as if I were in the Chairman's private residence. Looking around, I felt that this small guest room was almost enveloped by antique vases and old books, with an ancient square table in the middle, still the domain of ancient books and writing materials. Mr. Wen, with his long beard and dignified appearance, sitting in the middle, was perfectly suited, as if adorning this ancient room. This serene scene, with Chairman Lin's room full of antiques and a dazzling array of books, was almost indistinguishable.</p>
<p>"Poetry is not as wonderful as speech, leaves can surpass the fragrance of flowers," a short couplet hung opposite me, further convincing me that Mr. Wen was an elder with humorous and wonderful words. Below the couplet was a throne-like rattan chair, somewhat resembling a lotus seat in the Buddhist world. I had seen the throne of the Nona Hutukhtu in Nanjing, and it was similar. I always thought it was a product of a considerable era, but Mr. Wen said that it was a gift from an Indian friend, so it was still an antique imported item!</p>
<p>Mr. Wen lamented the current hardship of the people's livelihood. He reads the newspaper every day and is very concerned about commerce and economy. He suddenly mentioned the issue of the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on cash withdrawals from banks. He firmly said that the restrictions were well-intentioned, but the market still has exchange discounts, which negate the effectiveness of the restrictions. Therefore, if there are restrictions, there should be no exchange discounts. He hopes that the government and the Shanghai business community should take this matter seriously.</p>
<p>He greatly encouraged this newspaper, saying that the competition in the world's commerce and economy has reached the point of close combat. Shen Bao's reports on commerce and economy are quite detailed. He hopes that it will further guide the business community to increase knowledge and strengthen its power. From this, it can be seen that Mr. Wen is very concerned about the advancement of knowledge for young people in the business community.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen enjoys high prestige in the business community, which is self-evident. He did a lot for the country in his early years, but he did not dwell on his achievements. During our conversation, Mr. Wen said that it was a citizen fulfilling his due responsibility and was not worth mentioning. He said that he used to smoke cigarettes often, because a student was scolded by a teacher for smoking and was almost ashamed. In order to plead for this student, he felt that he should also give up the habit of smoking cigarettes. At 10 p.m. on April 30th of the eleventh year of the Republic, he was traveling on Mount Yuntai in Xuzhou. He decided to quit this habit, and for eighteen years, he has remained completely detached from cigarettes. He said: "I never lie in my life," because he had already said that he would no longer smoke cigarettes, of course, he would fulfill the principle of keeping his word without any compromise.</p>
<p>He usually gets up at 7 a.m. and goes to bed at 10 p.m., without taking a nap. He has no hobbies in his life, and he doesn't drink alcohol at all. His way of maintaining health is to have a regular life. He keeps books like Han Feizi on his desk. He said that most of his time each day is spent on books, and he loves to read philosophy books. When he was forty-six years old, he unfortunately lost his wife. He firmly believed that the worldly customs of widows remaining chaste after their husbands' deaths, while husbands can remarry after their wives' deaths, were unfair. So he started growing a beard that year, determined not to remarry. Speaking of this, he smiled and said that in the past twenty-four years, I have neither remarried nor had a concubine, which is just following the peace of my heart.</p>
<p>He especially disapproves of the social custom of sending out invitations for weddings and funerals. He has never printed invitations. He hopes that wasteful social gatherings should be reduced, and even regarded as a serious prohibition. His motivation for being a vegetarian was because of the uncleanness of livestock. Later, a friend persuaded him to believe in Buddhism, because he was naturally kind, so he started reading scriptures, and after a considerable period of time, he converted.</p>

<h3>To Become an Ideal Couple: Frequent Sexual Activity Requires Prompt Kidney Nourishment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>Young men and women are in love with each other, their hearts always depicting the beautiful image of their beloved, embracing sweet ideals. How beautiful and happy this is! If heaven and man comply, and they become a formal couple, the lover in their heart becomes a companion for life. Isn't this kind of newlywed sweetness even more intoxicating?</p>
<p>However, this joy of marriage often declines due to excessive indulgence between men and women. Many men and women, after their honeymoon, are ignorant of hygiene, resulting in men developing symptoms such as kidney deficiency and premature ejaculation within a few years, and women becoming anemic and prematurely aging due to indulgence. Therefore, to keep the joy of marriage fresh, in addition to moderation, pay attention to sexual power at all times to avoid weakening due to sexual activity. The "foundation of love" can only be consolidated by the soundness of sexual desire. Therefore, the abundance of sexual function cannot be considered the entire happiness of married life, but at least it can be considered the key to harmony. If sexual function is not satisfactory, there will never be happiness in the family. Therefore, couples should strive to maintain the health of this function.</p>
<p>Our sexual power may obviously change if we are ignorant of hygiene before marriage, but it will also become thin and pale, with kidney deficiency and premature ejaculation if we are too active in sexual activity after marriage. To study the causes of these diseases, we must first understand the role of the main gland in the human body, the puberty gland. The puberty gland is located in the testicles of men and the ovaries of women. This gland is often damaged by self-indulgence before marriage, but after marriage, it often loses its prosperity due to indulgence. Therefore, the occurrence of the above symptoms is due to these reasons. I am a specialist in sexual medicine. When I studied medicine in Soviet Russia, I repeatedly conducted various effective remedial therapies. According to experience, the most effective method is to use the genuine animal puberty gland extract, German "Körperkraft" for men, to increase sperm and nourish blood. The "Körperkraft" promotes the function of metabolism, nourishes the brain, nourishes the kidneys, nourishes the blood, and accelerates the development of reproductive organs. Countless sex disease experts in Europe and America know that the drug is accurate and is an effective medicine for treating kidney deficiency and premature aging, and the drug does not contain domineering impurities, and is suitable for all seasons. Anyone who loses health after marriage will recover immediately after taking it. The "Körperkraft" for women is an effective medicine for women's anemia, premature aging, and irregular menstruation. Those who suffer from infertility will become pregnant after taking it.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>New Treatment for Old Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine, USA</p>
<p>Whether gonorrhea is new or old, there is hope for recovery. The only goal is to completely eliminate it, so that not a single residual gonococcus remains. Eliminating gonorrhea also has its difficulties. Gonorrhea is easy to eradicate in the early stages, but after a long time, it often causes unexpected problems, making it difficult to eliminate. However, it is not untreatable. When gonococcus is in the anterior urethra, its base is not large, so it is not difficult to cure. But once it becomes chronic, there are many complications of gonorrhea, which are not only difficult for doctors to diagnose, but also more difficult to treat. Therefore, many people often declare a death sentence once gonorrhea becomes chronic. In fact, this is not always the case. If the latest scientific methods of treatment can be used, even the most stubborn and long-term old leucorrhea can be solved.</p>
<p>Speaking of the latest treatment for gonorrhea, from my many years of research and experience, nothing surpasses the remarkable effectiveness of the German gonorrhea specific medicine "Klimanon." This medicine was invented by Dr. Peter, a master of gonorrhea science. It not only destroys the initial gonorrhea like a crumbling, but also can easily cure the old gonorrhea whose roots are old. Because the medicine "Klimanon" is made according to non-specific therapy. I knew the effectiveness of this agent when I was studying in the United States. Since returning to China, my belief in "Klimanon" has become stronger. Since I used "Klimanon," male and female gonorrhea, such as acute and chronic gonorrhea prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, and female gonorrhea leucorrhea, vaginitis, oophoritis, etc., can be completely solved in three to five weeks after taking "Klimanon." Men with gonorrhea can also use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Cardil Snowdi Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories, which will be more effective.</p>
<h3>Consolidating the Jing Guan is a Thorough Treatment for Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine, Germany</p>
<p>Why is spermatorrhea not easy to cure? The reason is mostly because they do not know how to maintain health, or are still addicted to self-indulgence, so even if there is good medicine, it is difficult to help.</p>
<p>Self-indulgence and spermatorrhea are easy for young men and women to commit. In addition to being easy to break the hymen and damage the pure virgin spirit, the harm to women is not as deep as that to men. Men can often hinder the development of reproductive organs, damage the jing guan, and loosen their ejaculation center, so they have spermatorrhea. After worrying and impatience during the day, the semen will flow out automatically. In addition, there is also a symptom of physiological spermatorrhea, which is unavoidable for healthy unmarried people. It is completely caused by dream inducement, the number of resolutions is very rare, and they are never tired after spermatorrhea. However, people with weak will are easy to inspire the motivation for masturbation and gradually turn to pathology, making both the spirit and the body lose health!</p>
<p>To thoroughly cure spermatorrhea, you must first consolidate the jing guan, and quit masturbation and avoid labor. The most effective medicine for consolidating the jing guan is the German product "Neeres Spermatorrhea Tablets." Taking three tablets before going to bed will stop spermatorrhea that night. If the body is weak, or has been congenitally insufficient, or has neurasthenia, it is advisable to take the German testicular essence preparation "Körperkraft" for men, which is very effective.</p>
<h3>Special Treatment for Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— (Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang, Specialist in Pulmonary Diseases)</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is a very serious disease, so it is called a chronic self-destructive disease, but if we can solve the terrible pulmonary disease with the new wisdom of science, it is not difficult. Now, based on our more than 20 years of experience, there is reason to believe that pulmonary disease can be eliminated by scientific therapy. And can still return to a healthy state. Because I always use "Pulmonal One" invented by Dr. Thormer in Germany to cure early and second- and third-stage pulmonary diseases, such as tidal fever, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, phlegm is not refreshing, mental burnout, loss of appetite, shortness of breath like a cow, etc. Taking "Pulmonal" can stop coughing within four hours. During the period of the intellectual bag, all tuberculosis symptoms are gradually reduced day by day. At most one month, the difficult-to-heal pulmonary disease can be completely and fundamentally solved, defeating all perfunctory and making the patient neither dead nor alive pulmonary tuberculosis therapies. It is a truly effective therapy for pulmonary disease. No wonder major European and American pulmonary sanatoriums are scrambling to use it.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Lecture</p>
<h3>No Need to Be Pessimistic About Gonorrhea Turning Bad</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Gonorrhea originally has an easy-to-cure opportunity, but often let go and do not treat it. This is indeed a pity in the gonorrhea treatment community. If gonorrhea is once mistreated, the gonococcus will obtain a stronghold to carry out further internal invasion. As a result, the complications of gonorrhea will occur in various ways, and treatment will be more difficult. Although there are many reasons for this kind of disease, the patient's misuse of inferior drugs and local surgery of medical equipment to make the gonococcus escape inside is no different from an accomplice of gonorrhea. However, this kind of complication is not absolutely incurable. According to experience, many gonorrhea become bad diseases. As long as scientific therapy is used to save them, they can often save the situation of decline and make them rejuvenate. I have seen this many times in my 20 years of experience. Considering that gonococcus is a very easy-to-escape pathogen, our treatment should not be limited to the local area. Moreover, in the complications of gonorrhea, the gonococcus has mostly invaded three systems, that is, invading the urinary system to become cystitis, nephritis, etc., invading the reproductive system to become prostatitis, orchitis, etc., and invading the blood circulation system to become arthritis, etc. With these kinds of complications, treatment cannot be ignored</p>
<p>To cure such a wide range of gonorrhea, local therapy alone is not enough to cover all gonorrhea. I always use the gonorrhea specific medicine "Klimanon" as an internal medicine, and on the other hand, I use German static electricity therapy, German anti-gonorrhea serum, and X-ray electrotherapy, etc., and select them appropriately. Because "Klimanon" has the effect of searching for a wide range of gonococcus and destroying it, and local sterilization of each branch and section, and anti-gonorrhea serum, it can exert the effect of "Klimanon" to kill bacteria. Therefore, it can be effective. Consultation hours: 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. From now on, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation every day. Each number will only be charged five jiao, and a "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan will be given away.</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Warfare Occurs in Various Places in Tongtai, Japanese Warships Bombard Longwokou, Hutong Port, Niuhong Port is Chaotic, North Sand Navigation is Normal but Does Not Combine Bays</h3>
<p>Recently, the Chinese army in Subei, such as Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, Qi, Tai, etc., has adjusted most of the guerrillas to cooperate with the regular army, supplemented them completely, and obtained the belief of the people. They often report the traces of the Japanese army to the Chinese army's command organs. The Chinese army, according to reports, dispatched troops at any time to attack.</p>
<p>Exerting Power</p>
<p>Therefore, the Japanese army suffered great losses. Although under the guise of so-called "clearing unstable elements and suppressing guerrilla bandits," they transferred reinforcements from Shanghai and the Yangtze River to gather, forced the puppet self-defense corps to lead the way, went to various rural areas, and searched for guerrilla teams. However, the Chinese army was well-informed. When encountering small groups of Japanese and puppet troops, they immediately carried out raids and seized their weapons. When large groups of Japanese and puppet troops invaded, they hid and did not come out, and informed friendly forces according to the situation. After reinforcements from all sides arrived and made contact, they surrounded them.</p>
<p>To Annihilate</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet troops rarely broke through, so they were defeated in every battle, and the losses were extremely heavy. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter, who learned from the transportation industry, battles are currently taking place in the inner ports and rural areas of Tongtai. The rural area of Xinyang Baykou, the junction of Tong and Tai counties, was originally stationed by Chinese army guerrillas. On the 21st, the Japanese and puppet troops suddenly dispatched more than 100 soldiers, carrying sharp weapons such as machine guns and small steel cannons, and advanced from the land through Shigang and Juegang.</p>
<p>Attempting a Sneak Attack</p>
<p>On one side, a small gunboat of the Japanese navy sailed near Longwokou Port and fired to cover the landing of more than 60 Japanese soldiers on a speedboat. They were blocked by the defending Chinese army and fought back bravely, sweeping with machine guns. The Chinese army's mortar team also participated in the battle. As a result of the fierce battle, both sides suffered casualties. The Japanese and puppet troops on the land retreated to the vicinity of Shigang, and the Japanese warships were still parked on the sea in that area, harassing the coastal ports. Because the center of the war was on land, the waterways were smooth. The foreign shipping companies in the city, such as Jardine Matheson's Tonghe Wheel, are operating as usual, but</p>
<p>Cargo Transportation Drops Sharply</p>
<p>It has been affected. As for the location of the battle in Nantong, it is on the Houjia Oil Press and Guanyin Mountain. The Chinese army sent plainclothes advance teams to destroy transportation and consume Japanese and puppet troops' bullets, so as to contain their military strength. It has been quite effective. The Japanese and puppet troops feel deeply tired of running around. The situation in that area is chaotic. According to people in the shipping industry who spoke to the Daguan News Agency reporter, when the foreign shipping companies' ships such as Swire's Wantong and Far East's Haiyi returned from Beisha yesterday, they did not combine with the lower ports such as Hutong Port and Niuhong Port, but the outer ports such as Shanggang, Xintang, Lingdian Port, and Sanhe Port were still peaceful, and passengers and goods were still boarding and disembarking as usual. Today, there are many ships sailing to Beisha, such as Swire's Wantong, Far East's Haiyi, and Fuhua's Tingding.</p>
<h3>A Woman With Loose Morals Privately Has an Affair With a Friend of Her Husband, the Defendant Fails to Appear After Summons</h3>
<p>Shi Zhiyao from Ningbo was on good terms with his fellow villager Zhao Songmao. Shi's wife, Hu Linchun, silently compared the two and felt that Zhao was better than Shi. Therefore, on March 25th of the lunar calendar, she abandoned her six-year-old child and ran away from her husband to Zhao. They rented together at No. 11 Yidi Village, Hadong Road, as if they were a couple. Since the woman disappeared, Shi went to find her. It was not until the 12th of this month that he learned where they were hiding. He reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detectives to the address that night and found them on the spot. The man and woman also confessed to adultery. The police station then filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court in accordance with the law. The court hearing was held on Saturday morning, but the defendant Zhao Songmao dared to resist the summons and did not appear. Judge Fang questioned Shi Zhiyao and his wife Hu briefly, and ordered them to wait for Zhao to be brought to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Who Robbed the Shen Tai Timber Shop in Shiliupu Were Executed, Stealing Motors, Copper Wire, etc., and the Elderly Gatekeeper Was Beaten and Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>More than a dozen short-clothed thugs suddenly came to the Shen Tai Timber Shop in Xuejiawan, Shiliupu, Nanshi, late the day before yesterday, each holding weapons such as pistols, axes, and iron rulers, and broke in. They robbed all 40 motors in the sawmill and two large purple copper wires, each 20 zhang long, worth 4,500 yuan in total. Before leaving, they severely injured an elderly gatekeeper. After the shop reported the information to the Hongkou Japanese Army Department, which ordered the Japanese military police in Nanshi to investigate and arrest them, more than 40 robbers in this case were arrested. Three of them were identified by the injured gatekeeper as being heavily involved. They were tied up at the South Pier last night. One robber was cut into three pieces (head, body, and feet) by the Japanese army. The other two robbers were tied to electric poles with wire around their necks and stabbed to death with bayonets. However, the Japanese army has not yet found out that the robbers in this case possessed pistols and other weapons, and must continue to investigate the remaining accomplices.</p>
<h3>Cook Falsely Reports Robbery</h3>
<p>Six Months' Imprisonment, Suspended Sentence</p>
<p>Cui Delin from Tongzhou was a cook in the residence of a Westerner named James. He was usually honest and trustworthy, and was deeply trusted by his master. Recently, because the place where he worked was adjacent to major gambling dens in western Shanghai, he was tempted and occasionally went to gamble in his spare time, incurring many debts. His master was still unaware, so the day before yesterday (23rd), he was still asked to send 110 yuan in cash to the Datong Bank. Cui actually used this money as gambling capital and went to the gambling den at No. 71 Jing'an Temple Road to bet everything on one throw. When the money was exhausted, he cut open his pocket with a knife and returned home, falsely claiming that the money had been stolen by thieves on the way. The Westerner reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives to find out the truth and arrested Cui. The next morning, he was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Cui was willing to repay the money in installments and begged for mercy. Judge Fang, considering that he was a first-time offender, sentenced him to six months' imprisonment, suspended for three years in court.</p>
<h3>Chengye Company Repeatedly Sued Tenants to Move Out, Finally Rejected by the Supreme Court, Resolving the Housing Problem for Hundreds of Tenants</h3>
<p>The city houses and residences in Yufuli, Lane 135, Kaizier Road, French Concession, and the houses in Lane 126, Xiahui Road, etc., are all properties of Chengye Company at No. 2, Henry Road, Henryfang. They have been rented by Zhou Xifan, Jin Zixi, Zou Kezhong, Wu Wanheng, Dong Xueliang, Huang Chunrong, Wu Xinpu, Shao Yulin, Shao Huikang, Chen Antong, Zhang Daoxiu, Ma Jinliang, etc. for residence or business. The leases are all indefinite. Last autumn, in order to obtain the huge transfer fee from Xie Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop, Chengye Company, on the pretext that the houses were old and planned to be demolished and rebuilt, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting the court to order all tenants to move out. The tenants, Zhou Xifan, etc., jointly appointed lawyer Tang Hao to defend and oppose the move, detailing the plaintiff's litigation motive, which was to take advantage of this extraordinary period to drive away old tenants in order to obtain the huge transfer fee from new tenants. Their purpose was to harm the good order of society. After the court inquired about the case, it ruled that the plaintiff's claim was rejected. Zhu Xueseng, the legal representative of Chengye Company, refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Higher Branch Court, which was rejected. Zhu still refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, attempting to achieve the purpose of driving away the tenants. Xie Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop originally planned to open another branch at the entrance of Yufuli on Kaizier Road, but because Chengye Company failed to drive away the old tenants, it filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special Court the month before, accusing Zhu Xueseng of Chengye Company, requesting a judgment to return the transfer fee and compensation for losses of more than 10,000 yuan. After the court inquired about the case, it ruled that Zhu Xueseng also lost the case. It is now learned that Zhu Xueseng's appeal to the Supreme Court, requesting a judgment to order the tenants Zhou Xifan, etc. to move out, has been reviewed by the presiding judge of the Shanghai Special Zone Branch of the Supreme Court, Weng Jingtang, together with judges Guo Xuru and Cao Fengxiang, etc. The result was that Zhu Xueseng was deemed to have no reason, and the appeal was rejected the other day. The third instance litigation costs shall be borne by the appellant. The reasons for the judgment have been delivered to both parties. Since this case has been finalized by the Supreme Court, the housing problem of hundreds of men and women of tenants such as Zhou Xifan has been legally resolved from now on.</p>
<h3>Practicing Kung Fu, Fighting to Death</h3>
<p>Liu Changsheng from Changzhou, who lived at No. 7 Shudelili, Pingjili Road, French Concession, fought with his friend Xu Gaofa at the iron gate at the intersection of Laushenfu Road, Pingjili Road and Tangjiawan in the Chinese Concession at 9 p.m. on the 23rd of this month, fighting for the stone immortal shoulder pole while practicing kung fu, resulting in a conflict. At first, they quarreled, and then they fought and wrestled each other. Liu was beaten and injured by Xu, and reported to the French police, who arrested Xu. Liu was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died at 4 a.m. yesterday due to severe internal injuries. The hospital notified the police station, who moved the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. Yesterday was Sunday, and it will be reported to the Second Special Court today to send personnel for an examination.</p>
<h3>Woman Xu Pingan Accused of Adultery</h3>
<p>Zhai Yijing, the wife of Xuan Zhendong (also known as Fansheng), who resides at No. 9 Futian Village, Avenue Edward VII, recently filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, accusing Xu Pingan, who resides at Room 103, Xinda Xiang Building, Nanjing Road, of adultery with her husband, saying that she married Xuan Zhendong as his wife in the first year of the Republic of China. They were a loving couple and had already given birth to two sons. However, Xuan Zhendong often did not return home recently, and treated her like a discarded object. Now she knows that she was seduced and cohabited by Xu Pingan, and was deceived by sweet words, so she suddenly became so cold-hearted. Therefore, Xu Pingan is actually violating criminal law, and she is especially asking to summon him and punish him according to the crime he deserves according to criminal law, etc. The hearing was opened by Judge Fang on Saturday, but the defendant Xu Pingan and witness Xuan Zhendong did not comply with the summons and did not appear in court, so the hearing could not proceed and was rescheduled.</p>
<h3>A Woman Seven Months Pregnant Takes Poison and Dies</h3>
<p>A woman from Ningbo named Mao Baofeng, aged thirty-two, lived with her husband at No. 14, Dong Qinghua Li, Jules Pasteurs Road, in the French Concession. Yesterday, at approximately 10:00 AM, she suddenly had a quarrel with her family over a minor matter. In a moment of anger, she conceived the idea of ending her life. She secretly purchased poison and swallowed it in secret. By the time her family noticed something was amiss, she was already losing consciousness. They rushed her to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but because she had been poisoned too deeply, she could not be saved. She died from the poison at approximately 11:00 AM. At the same time, the woman was also pregnant, having reached seven months. The unborn child was also destroyed due to its mother's suicide, a truly tragic event.</p>
<h3>The Weather Turns Cool, and Heavy Rain Dispels the Heatwave</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai was hottest the day before yesterday, with temperatures nearing 100 degrees. The whole city felt like it was boiling. The heat did not dissipate that evening, and residents took to sleeping outdoors on mats. Some even sat outside until midnight before going to sleep. Despite fanning themselves constantly, they still sweated profusely. Yesterday morning, the sky began to turn overcast, and a gentle breeze stirred, easing the oppressive heat. By midday, there were intermittent showers. At 5:40 PM, the sky darkened like ink, and shortly after, heavy rain poured down, making the weather much cooler.</p>
<h3>Two Versions of the Bloody Case on Tianjin Road the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Peng Hanchang, a Cantonese man of forty-nine years, ran a foreign goods store at No. 4000 Wusong Road before the war. After the war, he closed the business and opened a Hongchang Woolen Yarn Store at No. 253 Tongfu Road. His family resided on the second floor of No. 333 Fuxu Road. When Peng was running the foreign goods store, his accountant, Mr. Wang, developed deep-seated grievances with Peng due to various reasons. The night before last, Wang suddenly learned that Peng and his wife were playing mahjong at a friend's house at No. 18 Tianjin Road. Wang, still harboring resentment, secretly went there and stabbed Peng in the abdomen three times. At the same time, Peng's wife was also stabbed. Blood flowed freely. They were rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment yesterday morning, but due to the severity of their injuries, their lives were in danger. The course of these events was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to Huang Guisong, the following account of the events is reported in a letter:</p>
<p>"I recently read in your esteemed newspaper about the stabbing of a couple by a thug lying in wait at No. 18 Tianjin Road. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. Huang is actually Shunxiang, and he has been employed by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway in Shanghai. Previously, a friend of his partnered with Peng Hanzhang to open a Songjiang Spring Restaurant on East Wuchang Road in Hongkou. Huang, entrusted by his friend, served as the manager of the restaurant. Because Peng Hanzhang's conduct was improper, with suspected embezzlement, Huang withdrew his investment midway to protect his friend's capital, causing the restaurant to close. Peng harbored resentment towards Huang, believing he instigated it. Consequently, at 11 PM on the 24th of this month, Peng and his wife, concealing a sharp knife, went to Huang's residence at No. 18 Tianjin Road to seek revenge. Huang was at home, enjoying the cool air. He was stabbed once. Huang immediately rose to defend himself. Peng's wife, fearing her husband would lose, stepped forward to help fight. All three were injured in the melee. Fortunately, a Chinese constable arrived and took them all to the police station. The report in your esteemed newspaper that Huang learned Peng was playing mahjong at a friend's house on Tianjin Road is inconsistent with the facts because that lane is where Huang lives. Peng, in fact, came with his wife from the French Concession to Huang's residence on Tianjin Road, armed with a knife, to seek revenge. I have always admired the fairness of your newspaper's commentary. I hope you will correct this. Respectfully submitted to the editor of the Shen Bao, Huang Guisong."</p>
<h3>Nine Japanese Planes Arrive at Dachang Airfield Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at approximately 10:00 AM, a large, gray biplane took off from the Japanese airfield at Dachang. It flew low and circled over Zhabei and Hongkou, no more than a few hundred meters above the ground, seemingly to welcome other planes. Shortly after, at approximately 10:15 AM, three formations of gray monoplanes, each with three planes, flew from the southwest clouds along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. They circled over Pudong, the Nanshi, and the western part of Shanghai before flying over the foreign concessions, Zhabei, Hongkou, Jiangwan, Wusong, and landing at the Dachang airfield. When passing over the concessions, the nine planes formed a single formation, creating a loud noise. Pedestrians stopped on the roadside to look up.</p>
<h3>Weng Xunxun's Summer Discount for Medical Consultations</h3>
<p>Mr. Weng Xunxun, a distinguished disciple of the renowned Menghe doctor Ding Jiwan, has established his clinic at Aishou Lane, No. 64, Meibaiq Road. Considering that summer has arrived and the number of patients is increasing, he has decided to offer discounted consultations for two months, starting July 1st, to reduce the financial burden on impoverished patients. Those who seek consultation will only be charged 20 cents for the appointment fee. House calls, regardless of distance, will cost one yuan for transportation. However, this is only limited to the consultation hours set by the doctor. Outside of those hours, regular fees will apply.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals Collude with Chinese and Korean Nationals to Extort Gambling Dens; Arrested for Extorting 30,000 Yuan Claiming They Could Obtain an Operating Permit; Five Japanese, Korean, and Chinese Nationals Detained</h3>
<p>A news agency reports that since gambling dens became active in western Shanghai over a year ago, incidents of taking advantage of the situation to extort money from the gambling dens have frequently occurred. According to an announcement from the Japanese side yesterday, recently, some of its nationals colluded with Chinese and Korean nationals, impersonating Japanese military police interpreters, and engaged in systematic extortion. After obtaining this information, the Japanese side ordered the military police to investigate the matter thoroughly. On the 21st of this month, the extortionists were arrested. It is said that several Japanese and Korean nationals contacted Qian Zhengwen, the operator of a gambling den at No. 864 Yuyuan Road, claiming they could obtain permission for the gambling den, which had been shut down, to continue operating, but it would require 30,000 yuan in lobbying fees. They also stated that after obtaining permission to reopen, they would require a daily reward of 200 yuan. An agreement was reached. At 10:00 AM on the 21st, they were formally negotiating the payment inside the gambling den at No. 864. However, their plot was discovered by the Japanese military police. On the 21st, Japanese nationals Senta Atsushi (31 years old, No. 164 Kunshan Road), Asanuma Ryoichiro (23 years old), and Fukuyama Taro (21 years old, No. 6 Jinfu Li, Baibao Road, North Sichuan Road), Chinese national Chuan Xue Zhang (36 years old, No. 61 Kader Road), and Korean national Lim Chang-soo (29 years old, No. 149 Yuanmingyuan Road) were arrested. They are currently being interrogated and detained.</p>

<h3>Resolution of the Brother-on-Brother Assault Case; Each Sets Up His Own Household and Separates the Family; Reconciliation Achieved, Lawsuit Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Shen Xiongqing, a local Shanghai resident of 40 years of age residing at No. 2, Ayer New Village, Albert Road, in the French Concession, is currently a professor at the Shanghai Medical College on Haig Road. His father worked for the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in Nanshi in his early years. During the attack on the Manufacturing Bureau by Liu Fubiao's troops of the Fu character army in the summer of the second year of the Republic of China (1913), Shen's father sacrificed his life in the line of duty and received a pension. Shen relied on this money to pass the official-funded entrance examination for Qinghua University in Beiping.</p>
<p>Studied in Europe and America</p>
<p>After returning to China, he successively served as a professor at various universities. Shen has a younger brother, Shen Yuqing, 27 years old, who is a posthumous child. Their elderly mother is still alive. The brothers and their mother live together. Yuqing works at the He Feng Foreign Firm. However, the Shen brothers have not yet divided the family property and live together. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, at 1:00 PM, the Shen Xiongqing and Shen Yuqing brothers had a conflict over inheritance issues. After fighting each other, they each went to the French police station to</p>
<p>File Assault Charges</p>
<p>and request investigation. The police station, considering that the Shens were brothers and the dispute was within the family, did not detain them and ordered them to return home to await further instructions. Yuqing requested a medical examination at the Prosecutor's Office of the Special District Court. On the 8th of this month, the police station escorted the Shen brothers to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special District Court, where lawyer Yao Zhaodi, representing the French Concession authorities,</p>
<p>Filed a Public Prosecution</p>
<p>for assault. The Shens hired lawyers Shen Weihan and Wang Hengyuan to defend them. After Judge Zhu Chuzhe's interrogation, he ordered a postponement for further questioning and instructed both parties to reconcile outside the court. It has been learned that after the Shen family relatives learned of the matter in the newspaper, they tried their best to mediate between the Shen brothers and obtained the consent of the Shen's elderly mother to divide the family property so that the brothers could each set up their own household and separate the family. Now</p>
<p>Reconciliation is Established</p>
<p>Therefore, when the court reconvened the other day, the Shen Xiongqing and Shen Yuqing brothers each requested the court to withdraw the charges. Judge Zhu Chuzhe approved the request and ruled that the case would not be accepted. The brothers' dispute came to an end, and the Shen brothers happily left the court hand in hand.</p>

<h3>Machine Factory Technician Withdraws Shares; Sues Shareholders for Defamation; Demands Compensation of One Yuan for Losses</h3>
<p>Xu Fusheng, a local Shanghai resident residing at No. 201, Zhu Jiaku, Haig Road, previously partnered with Cao Zuochen, a local Shanghai resident residing at No. 800, Belle Road, to open the Tianhua Machine Factory. Xu served as the technician. Later, Xu partnered with a shareholder surnamed Ji to design and operate the Jiji Machine Factory. Cao Zuochen believed that Xu had violated the partnership agreement by operating the same business, which damaged the business of the Tianhua Factory, and a dispute arose. Xu then withdrew his shares. Cao entrusted Xu Wufang to represent him in publishing an announcement in the newspaper to inform all customers that Xu had withdrawn his shares. After seeing the newspaper announcement, Xu Fusheng believed that Cao's publication was detrimental to him and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Special District Court, accusing Cao Zuochen of defamation and requesting a legal investigation, and also included a civil suit requesting the court to order the defendant to pay one yuan in national currency for reputational damage. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court opened a hearing the other day and summoned both parties. The plaintiff, along with his lawyer, appeared in court and stated the previous events and presented the newspaper as evidence. The defendant, Cao Zuochen, along with his defense lawyer, Xu Wufang, appeared in court and stated that the plaintiff was originally a shareholder of the Tianhua Factory, but because he violated the partnership agreement, the defendant legally convened a meeting of the partners, resolved to have the plaintiff and Ji withdraw their shares and be removed, and legally entrusted a lawyer to publish a public announcement, which was not illegal or improper. He requested a declaration of innocence. The court verified the statements and, after ordering arguments, announced the conclusion and set a date for the verdict.</p>
<h3>Mail to Dinghai Forwarded via Wenzhou and Ningbo</h3>
<p>Parcel Post to Eastern Zhejiang Unaffected</p>
<p>Dinghai (Zhoushan) has recently experienced an outbreak of war, disrupting transportation. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with relevant departments of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday morning. The bureau has decided to arrange for the forwarding of all kinds of lightweight mail to Dinghai through the post offices in Wenzhou and Ningbo. However, large parcels of goods to Dinghai have been suspended since the interruption of shipping between Shanghai and Dinghai and have not been restored. If the war drags on, the acceptance of small parcels may also be suspended. As for parcel post to various counties and cities in eastern Zhejiang, they are all forwarded through Wenzhou and Ningbo and should not be affected. However, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is still limited to the area below Jinhua.</p>

<h3>Report of the Livestock Protection Association for May</h3>
<p>All Reports of Cruelty to Horses Must Record the Branding Number</p>
<p>The Shanghai Livestock Protection Association's report for May 1939 states that during May, the association's investigators inspected the Municipal Council's dog pound and found that it had been improved with the installation of skylights, making the air and light more adequate. The drainage facilities in several dog pens still need improvement. Most horse stables had lame horses, which were apparently being rested. During this month, the association found only one incident of a lame horse being used for work, and the owner was fined six yuan.</p>
<p>When members of the public report incidents of lame or weak horses being forced to work or horses being overloaded, please record the license plate number of the vehicle and the branding number of the horse. These numbers are usually located on the upper left side of the horse's rear. This is the only way to identify abused horses. Two lame horses were put up for auction, but the sale was canceled at the request of the association's investigators.</p>
<p>Due to the need to transport pigs for tax collection by the "authorities" outside the concession this month, fewer pigs arrived in port, so the number of inspections of pig boats and pig pens also decreased. Investigators inspected three fires, all of which were near dairy sheds or livestock barns, but fortunately, none of the livestock were affected. In addition to the above inspections, investigators also patrolled various areas within the two concessions daily and handled many complaints of cruelty to livestock.</p>
<p>Incidents of slaughtering cats and dogs to sell their meat were investigated. Two people were punished by the French Concession authorities for this crime. The association received repeated reports that someone was selling sparrows near the western children's school on Columbia Road, but this person has not yet been seen by investigators. During the month, the association discovered a particularly cruel incident involving a laborer who deliberately put lime in a dog's eyes. The dog suffered terribly and eventually went blind. The association humanely euthanized the dog and, with the help of the French police, apprehended the laborer, who was sentenced to thirty days in prison. The association received a report that there was an incident of cruel pig handling on Avenue Joffre and quickly took action, reporting the individuals involved to the Jing'an Temple police station.</p>
<p>In addition to the work of the association's permanent staff, much work to alleviate the suffering of livestock is done by public-spirited individuals. The association's June issue of "The Blue Cross" magazine is currently being edited and will be mailed free of charge to all members at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Li Jingtai Carries a Broken Gun and Counterfeit Money; A Detective Partner Frames Him by Abandoning Stolen Goods; After Interrogation, Li is Found Not Guilty and Released; Detective Partner Sentenced to Ten Months for False Accusation</h3>
<p>Li Jingtai, a man from Shandong, 34 years old, residing at No. 162, Yidingpan Road, previously worked as a police officer in the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, at approximately 1:00 PM, he was stopped near the intersection of Connaught Road and Avenue Joffre by Chinese Constable No. 2258. A broken Browning automatic pistol and three counterfeit banknotes, including two 5-yuan Jiaotong banknotes and one Chinese banknote, were found in a paper package he was carrying. He was taken to the Gordon Road Police Station and sent to the Special First Court. He confessed that the gun and counterfeit money were given to him by his friend Ge Yuting from Anhui, who promised to pay him 20 yuan to carry them. He was deceived by Ge and asked the court to investigate. In the middle of the adjournment, Ge was arrested and sent to the court. Chinese Constable No. 2258 admitted that Ge was his detective partner, but he did not report the matter. Ge Yuting denied abandoning stolen goods and falsely accusing Li Jingtai. Judge Jiang Shuzhi clarified the facts through interrogation and ordered them to be returned to custody to await sentencing. The verdict was delivered in the Third Criminal Court the day before yesterday. Li Jingtai was found not guilty and released, while Ge Yuting was sentenced to ten months in prison for false accusation as a warning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council's Health Overview for May</h3>
<p>Typhoid Fever Exists Throughout the Year; Flies are a Carrier of Infection</p>
<p>The health situation in Shanghai last month was similar to that in April, with no major changes. Scarlet fever was found in a Jewish refugee camp, but there was only one death, so it did not become serious. Typhoid fever was quite prevalent at the end of the month. This disease has always been more common in the summer months, but in recent years, it has existed throughout the year. Although the reason is difficult to determine, it is conceivable that flies are a carrier of infection. The Health Department has been paying close attention to this issue and is advising citizens to get typhoid vaccinations for prevention. Meningitis has decreased significantly. The Health Department has tried a new treatment method, and the results show that the mortality rate has been greatly reduced, and medical expenses have also been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Causes of Death</p>
<p>A total of 3,023 Chinese deaths were recorded, including 2,005 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were tuberculosis, pneumonia, and typhoid fever. A total of 82 people requested treatment for dog rabies. Among the patients admitted to the New Zha Road branch of the Chinese Isolation Hospital, the most were those suffering from meningitis, with 43 cases. Among the patients admitted to the Beihai Road branch, the most were those suffering from measles, with 60 cases. Cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria, paratyphoid fever, smallpox, and malaria were also recorded. Medical services at the schools set up by the bureau were carried out as usual. A total of 893 students requested treatment for trachoma. A total of 334 private Chinese schools receiving subsidies from the bureau were inspected, and 15 schools were found to be in full compliance with the Health Department's regulations. Ten schools have taken steps to improve student overcrowding.</p>
<p>Sanitation Facilities</p>
<p>The vegetable markets in the concession operated as usual. Meat prices stabilized at the end of the month. As summer approaches, the Health Department has paid special attention to fly prevention in food stores. Two ice cream shops were ordered to close because their products were found to be substandard after chemical testing. A total of 11,841 pigs were imported from other areas, only one-third of the total number in April. The number of those that died upon landing was half that of April. Last month, the Health Department vaccinated a total of 36,392 people and administered 167,114 vaccinations. Mosquito and fly control work has been intensified. As of the end of May, there were 39 refugee camps in the concession, housing a total of 40,976 refugees. Disinfection work in the refugee camps is still being carried out as usual. A total of 2,752 bodies were cremated, 966 coffins were buried, and 19,953 coffins were stored in funeral homes and coffin storage facilities, an increase of 1,353 coffins compared to April.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Mr. Cao Bingsheng; Contents of Family's Thank-You Speech</h3>
<p>Letter from Ms. Cao Sun Xueying; Slightly Different from Yesterday's Newspaper</p>
<p>Yesterday, various groups in Shanghai held a memorial service for Mr. Cao Bingsheng at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area. Details were published in yesterday's newspaper. Now, a letter has been received from Ms. Cao Sun Xueying, which reads: "To the esteemed editor, yesterday (the 24th), the 52 public organizations in Shanghai, along with Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Yuan Lidun, Xu Jiqing, Xu Caicheng, Lin Kanghou, Xi Yushu, Dai Chunfeng, and Huang Zenshi presided over the memorial service for my late husband, Mr. Bingsheng. I am deeply grateful for the presence of dignitaries from all walks of life and the solemn ceremony. Regarding the widow's thank-you speech, the main points were as follows: (1) My late husband's martyrdom has been deeply mourned by all circles at home and abroad. In addition to my grief, I am deeply grateful for the sympathy from all sides. (2) My late husband was honest and self-disciplined throughout his life and had no property. The widespread sense of justice and sympathy from all quarters, both those who knew him and those who did not, is the most valuable spiritual asset in the world. I will respectfully accept and never forget it. (3) I am deeply saddened by this great change and wish I could die, but I know that crying and being passive is only a sign of weakness. I am determined to carry on my late husband's legacy, work hard, and serve the country loyally to comfort my late husband's spirit in heaven and to repay the kindness of all those who have shown sympathy. This determination is further supported by the establishment of a memorial school and a memorial inscription for my late husband with the assistance of all parties. I hereby express my gratitude. The above points were personally heard by all those present, but today (the 25th), upon reading the newspaper, I found some discrepancies. Therefore, I have written this letter to request a correction to conform to the facts. With respect, Cao Sun Xueying."</p>

<h3>Interview with the Director of the Vocational Guidance Center: How Graduates Should Find Employment. Choose a Career Based on Strengths and Interests for Better Results</h3>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Guidance Center holds guidance events for further education and employment every summer. This year, 26 people, including Chen Qingshi, have been hired as lecturers to give speeches at various schools. Since its establishment, many schools have sent letters to the center requesting lecturers to visit their schools, and many students have personally requested assistance. Director Zheng Wenhan told a Shanghai News Agency reporter the other day that "Graduating means unemployment" is a very popular saying among graduates of various schools today. Many people come to the center asking for job placement. However, it is extremely difficult to introduce jobs to middle school graduates from general subjects, especially junior high school graduates, who have not received specialized technical training. When asked what kind of job they would like to take, they often answer with the phrase "any job". From this answer, one can see their lack of purpose and central ideas. If, according to their answers, they are introduced to smaller shops such as shoe stores or food stores to work as trainees, they are unwilling. Therefore, middle school students who want someone to introduce them to a job should first ask themselves what their strengths are and what kind of job they are interested in. If they are good at writing, have good eloquence, and are interested in radio, they can ask someone to introduce them to clerk, salesperson, or radio company trainee positions. Choosing a career based on one's interests and strengths will often lead to better results.</p>

<p>Mr. I, not only a monetary expert but also currently holding an important position in the city's financial circles. As requested, his name will not be disclosed to the public. This article addresses the repeated restrictions on cash withdrawals and the reintroduction of the remittance system, aiming to eliminate the past abuses of remittance discounts. The transfer-account system has been in use for a long time in Ningbo, Shaoxing, and other places and has been found convenient and free of abuses. We hope that all sectors will pay attention and study it together to implement it effectively. If remittance notes bear a "transfer-account only" stamp, the loopholes for speculation in remittance discounts will be completely blocked. This will not only restore the parity between remittances and legal tender but also prevent capital flight and reduce the need for cash. Once the difference between remittances and cash disappears, and the movement of currency is limited to legitimate commercial transactions, prices can stabilize, and the foreign exchange market can calm down. However, how to improve the review system for legitimate foreign exchange needs and legitimate cash needs? How to prevent the foreign exchange and cash obtained from being used for other purposes? We hope that domestic experts will come together to study these issues. This newspaper will wholeheartedly provide this platform for open discussion. – Editor</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been known as a "cash port." Since the August 13th Incident, remittances have only been allowed for interbank transfers and cannot be cashed out the next day. Thus, Shanghai's "cash port" has transformed into a "transfer-account" port. However, in reality, due to (1) the clearing house's ability to discount "remittances" and (2) the court's ruling that remittance notes are not considered valid payment for rent, the general consensus is to use legal tender as the standard for transactions. The use of legal tender as the standard accelerates capital flight and affects the foreign exchange market. Recently, the black market exchange rate has fallen from 8.25 pence to 6.5 pence. New deposits after August 13th have been restricted to a withdrawal limit of 500 yuan in legal tender, causing panic and rumors. Given the current environment, regardless of the merits or demerits of previous policies and measures, it seems appropriate for the financial sector to seize the opportunity to transform Shanghai's financial market into a "transfer-account port" to (1) strengthen the credit of legal tender, (2) reduce the outflow of foreign exchange reserves, and (3) facilitate legitimate industrial and commercial transactions. There is no need to reinvent the wheel and agitate the public, which would only create opportunities for "Hua Xing." Here are some proposed measures for research:</p>
<p>(1) Starting from [Date], Shanghai will be a "transfer-account" port, and all payments will be made via "transfer-account." All notes will be stamped with a "transfer-account" stamp, allowing only interbank transfers and no cash withdrawals. Exceptions will be made for specific reasons where cash (legal tender) payment is specified.</p>
<p>(2) Deposits made before August 13th will be processed as usual. Deposits made after August 13th will be processed according to the Ministry of Finance's telegram, that is, 500 yuan of legal tender can be withdrawn per week. Payments exceeding the limit will be made with promissory notes stamped with "transfer-account only," allowing only "transfer-account."</p>
<p>(3) Bank accounts will be divided into cash (legal tender) accounts and "transfer-account" accounts. Deposits made with legal tender will be credited to the cash account and can be withdrawn in legal tender. Deposits made with "transfer-account notes" will be credited to the "transfer-account" account. Withdrawals will be made with "transfer-account" notes.</p>
<p>(4) Remittances from inland areas to Shanghai should be used to pay "transfer-account" notes as a principle.</p>
<p>(5) Bank "transfer-account" account deposits can be used for legitimate purposes such as wage payments, requiring legal tender. Applications can be made to the clearing house (assuming such an organization exists) to allocate legal tender without fees and should be provided as much as possible.</p>
<p>(6) "Transfer-account" notes will be legally recognized as valid payment and can be used for rent payments, etc.</p>
<p>(7) "Transfer-account" notes will be prohibited from private discounting for a fee. Such actions will not be legally protected and will be subject to legal sanctions.</p>
<p>(8) Existing remittance notes or remittance accounts will be converted to "transfer-account" notes or "transfer-account" accounts at the original clearing house price. The term "remittance" will no longer be used.</p>
<p>(9) Existing legal tender accounts, except for those opened before June 22nd, will be converted to transfer-account accounts.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is best to moderately extend the foreign exchange rates and provide foreign exchange in other locations. However, the supply should also be strictly limited to those with proof of necessity.</p>
<h3>Another Word on Suppressing Rice Prices</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhizhi</p>
<p>Those in the rice business attribute the soaring rice prices in the city to the imbalance of supply and demand, extortion by certain parties, and manipulation by hoarders. The so-called supply and demand imbalance is due to the Japanese army's consumption in China, smuggling back to Japan, resale in South China and North China, and interception along the way, causing merchants to hold back and Shanghai to fall into a rice shortage. They cite reports of declining rice reserves in various periods as evidence. However, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are the main rice-producing area in the country. In the past, it supplied the entire country. Now, due to transportation disruptions, even if the Japanese buy and re-export, the quantity should not be greater than in the past during times of free export and re-export. There is no doubt about that. Moreover, last year's rice harvest in Japan was abundant, and there were virtually no imports of Chinese rice according to its customs records. On the contrary, there was a large surplus of flour and other grains to China, indicating that a portion of the Japanese army's rations in China is still supplied from Japan. Furthermore, precisely because wartime freight is disrupted, Shanghai is the main outlet for the surplus rice production in the interior. Judging from reports in Japanese newspapers and magazines and the "economic tactics" of certain parties in the occupied areas, they are restoring the economy in the occupied areas as one of their strategies to control China. Therefore, while extortion during the transport of rice to Shanghai is undoubtedly a fact, the desire to export rice for sale is also a necessary means to carry out their China-controlling tactics, maintain the "finances" of the puppet regime, and absorb legal tender for the purpose of buying foreign exchange. Therefore, a ban on rice exports from the interior may exist, but it is clearly a temporary phenomenon used to coerce and achieve their extortion goals. If the Shanghai rice market adheres to the original price limit of 14 yuan, their extortion will inevitably stop there. Because they must export the surplus rice production. Relaxing the original price limit of 14 yuan to 15 yuan, and now accommodating market price increases by raising the limit price to 21 yuan again, is a major mistake. Once the price limit can be relaxed, extortion can be endless. This is tantamount to handing over the power to manipulate Shanghai's rice prices to certain parties! Considering today's rice reserves in Shanghai, although the announced reserves are reduced, the reserves of hoarders have increased. Regardless of whether "hoarders" and rice merchants are one and the same or two separate entities, the reason for the emergence of "hoarders" and their ability to "manipulate rice prices" lies in the failure to adhere to the original price limit. Furthermore, "hoarders" are also suppliers, so they have not fundamentally broken the supply-demand balance of rice in Shanghai. Therefore, rice merchants cannot shirk their responsibility for hoarding and driving up prices. Accommodating market price increases by raising the limit price to 21 yuan is also falling into a trap. In the spring of the ninth year of the Republic, the price limit for rice in Shanghai also reached a maximum of 21 yuan, but considering the differences in today's and past measurements, this newspaper has pointed out that today's limit price is actually more than three yuan higher than in the past. The sharp rise in rice prices in the spring of the nineteenth year was indeed due to a poor harvest the following year and a genuine imbalance in supply and demand, which is completely different from today's situation where reserves are abundant and sources are bound to be constant. We hope that the authorities can understand the difficulties of the people, make impartial corrections, and promote them with the administrative power of the concession. Otherwise, if the manipulator's plan is successful once, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not continue to do so, and the consequences will be endless. – Editor</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War shifted west, Shanghai has become an "isolated island," and everything has become a special phenomenon. On the commercial front, on the one hand, the influx of refugees and the surge in consumption have created a superficial prosperity. On the other hand, the surrounding areas have become ruins, and production has decreased. Moreover, due to the occupation and the deliberate monopoly and obstruction by certain parties, the prices of native products, which are not affected by foreign exchange, have also risen. Among them, the recent surge in rice prices is even more worrying.</p>
<p>However, it is said that at least 2 million bags of rice are currently stockpiled in Shanghai (according to estimates by those familiar with the market situation). Moreover, the transport of rice to Shanghai from the interior has never stopped for a single day. Therefore, the city's rice supply is not a problem, at least for the time being. Given these facts, according to the principles of supply and demand, today's rice prices should be able to stand firm at the previously set price limit without any doubt. However, the opposite is actually the case. Shanghai's rice prices have jumped out of the original 14 yuan limit and broken the new 15 yuan limit. Now, they have soared to over 21 yuan, forcing the authorities of the two concessions and rice industry groups to set 21 yuan as the current price limit. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>First: The failure of the price limit policy. The food organizations originally set the maximum price for white rice at 14 yuan per stone in the rice market and stipulated that transactions above the price limit were invalid, and even stipulated penalties. However, in reality, transactions were made outside the price limit. The price limit committee did not exercise its power to control the situation beforehand, nor could it guide the situation, or severely punish offenders afterward. As a result, the price surge began and has been unstoppable.</p>
<p>Second: The monopoly and increased levies by certain parties have increased the cost of transporting rice to Shanghai. This is the same situation as other native products such as broad beans.</p>
<p>Third: Panic in the market. After the Tianjin incident, certain parties threatened to take certain measures in Shanghai. People inevitably became agitated and rushed to buy rice, prompting a sharp rise in market prices.</p>
<p>Fourth: Manipulation by speculators. This is the same as speculation in other goods. Rice is a necessity of life for residents and is more easily exploited by them. This has undoubtedly contributed to the continued rise in rice prices.</p>
<p>These are the reasons for the rise in rice prices. Let us offer another word on how to suppress them.</p>
<p>First: Set a standard price and enforce it strictly. Although setting a price limit is passive, there is currently no more effective measure. However, before setting this price limit, all factors, such as inland rice prices and freight charges, must be considered to prevent merchants from making excuses again.</p>
<p>Second: Rice industry groups and the authorities of the two concessions should conduct strict supervision. Violators should be brought to justice. Rice industry groups should also maintain close contact with the authorities of the concession.</p>
<p>Third: Attention should also be paid to the smooth flow of supplies. Shanghai has more than 4 million mouths to feed, but it does not produce rice itself. It relies on supplies from the surrounding areas of Suzhou, Changzhou, Kunshan, Wuxi, and Wuhu. Therefore, opening up the sources of supply is very important.</p>
<p>Fourth: Conduct registration, thoroughly investigate hoarding households, and force them to sell.</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Copper Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>— Chen Baorong</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Finance, in view of the soaring copper prices overseas, has long prohibited the private export of copper coins. Shanghai, being located in an occupied area, is beyond the reach of the government's power. The Jianghai Customs, forced by the environment, is unable to enforce the order. Certain parties are deliberately disrupting finance and undermining monetary policy, hoping to affect the strength of the resistance war. Therefore, they spare no effort to raise prices to collect copper coins. Initially, they purchased copper coins from the Great Qing Guangxu period, which had thicker copper and higher purity. Then, they collected Republic of China copper coins and the one-cent new subsidiary coins. It is said that 250 old copper coins are worth 3 yuan in national currency, and 100 new subsidiary coins are worth 1.2 to 2 yuan in national currency. In general, unscrupulous merchants, driven by profit, constantly search the market for large quantities, transport them to Hongkou, and then ship them overseas by certain parties. It is said that the annual private export volume often reaches as high as 50 million yuan. The Central Bank, forced to do so, has recently stopped transporting new subsidiary coins to Shanghai for replenishment. Therefore, the shortage of copper coins in this port has been a long-standing issue. However, the general public has not fully realized it. Recently, after the Shanghai Tram and Bus Company posted a notice announcing the shortage of copper coins, residents began to be alarmed. Those who did not hoard coins in the past are now treating them as scarce commodities. As a result, copper coins have completely disappeared from the market.</p>
<p>As a result of the lack of copper coins, general retail transactions have become almost impossible. The impact on the common people is particularly severe, as some stores have converted small denominations into larger ones, effectively raising prices. For example, daily necessities that originally cost 7 or 8 cents are now priced at 10 cents, nominally to avoid making change, but actually to take advantage of the situation. Not only that, but many stores have also begun to issue their own private notes. They arbitrarily write amounts on blank pieces of paper of varying sizes, even on the backs of discarded calendar pages, and stamp them with a store seal to be used in place of copper coins. However, because these notes are limited to use in one store, the scope is too narrow, and the circulation is not widespread. The New Gate Road and other city joint branches have now issued joint substitute coupons, which is a measure of expediency and is not to be condemned, but it is an illegal act after all. Even if there is a considerable reserve, there is no strict supervisory body: moreover, the notes are crudely made and easily counterfeited, leading to abuses. Therefore, the Central Bank has sent a telegram to Shanghai, stating that this self-printed substitute coupon is detrimental to the entire financial market and is not allowed to be issued. However, the British and French Concession public bus and tram companies, due to business needs, are now completely using tokens. The French Concession trams use two types of tokens, one-cent and two-cent, made of cardboard, with Chinese and English translations. They were issued on June 18th, with a validity period until the end of August. Although the British-owned tram company in the Public Concession does not refuse to use stamps and revenue stamps, it also issued tokens in two denominations, two-cent and three-cent, on the same day, made of thin cardboard, also with Chinese and English explanations. The company stipulates that these tokens can be used on the trams and can be redeemed at the company's office at 185 Suzhou Road.</p>
<p>As for the small-denomination transactions in various industries throughout the city, the only common bargaining chips at present are stamps and revenue stamps. Stamps are the most common, while revenue stamps are less common. This proportional measure is quite legitimate, and it has eliminated many disputes in the market due to the lack of copper coins. However, they are more difficult to carry and are easily soiled, which is not convenient after all. However, before the authorities issue a formal remedy, it is still a way to tide over the crisis. Using stamps and revenue stamps as currency substitutes is not new and can be called an "ancient and universal practice." There are even stamps issued specifically for currency use in foreign countries.</p>
<p>Because stamps are substitutes for postage issued by the state, and coins are national commercial mediums. When there is a shortage of coins, using stamps as substitutes is theoretically the most reasonable. Usually, major companies with mail-order departments also have the practice of using stamps as currency to purchase goods, which is most commonly used in the cultural industry.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the German Federal Empire, the northern and southern states each issued stamps independently. The design of these stamps had a clear Arabic numeral in the middle, and the background was painted with extremely delicate network patterns, which were used to exchange for coins, with the same effect as banknotes. Later, as Prussia became stronger and stronger, it was replaced by Prussian stamps, which are now rare German old stamps.</p>
<p>In the early days of the American Civil War, due to a lack of currency, stamps were also used as substitutes to tide over the emergency.</p>
<p>When the European War broke out in 1914, Russia was the first to be involved in the vortex. Due to a lack of currency, it also issued three types of stamps in 1915, 10 kopeks, 15 kopeks, and 20 kopeks, to replace currency. To consider practical convenience, these stamps were printed on thin cardboard with no glue on the back. It also had a sentence in Russian, which meant "This ticket is equal to the same value of silver coins."</p>
<p>Various industries throughout the city are now using stamps as change in business, and over time, they are gradually getting used to it. The panic situation is therefore not as serious as it was at the beginning. It was previously reported that the Central Bank would transport newly minted copper-nickel subsidiary coins from Kunming to Shanghai for replenishment, and they would arrive in Shanghai soon. If so, then the newly minted copper coins will encounter the same fate as the previous copper coins in Shanghai, disappearing without a trace. Is the Central Bank so foolish?</p>
<p>Although stamps are a temporary and legitimate common medium of exchange, it is hoped that the Ministry of Finance will issue a clear order to national banks to issue fractional currency notes as soon as possible for a permanent solution. Or, referring to the example of the Zhejiang Local Bank, the Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Library should be given the power to issue such fractional currency notes for a certain period. If the issue is not resolved for a long time, then the illegal substitute coupons issued by private individuals and others may damage the integrity of the current monetary system.</p>
<h3>Measures to Restrict Withdrawals Again</h3>
<p>— Lin Yuesheng</p>
<p>To understand the Ministry of Finance's measures to restrict legal tender withdrawals for Shanghai depositors, one must first understand the reason why the Hong Kong Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee stopped supplying the Shanghai black market with foreign exchange on the 7th of this month:</p>
<p>The existence of the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange originally contradicted our national policy. The Central Bank had already been ordered to implement foreign exchange controls and approval procedures, closing the road to illegal capital flight. The foreign exchange black market is not only a way for illegal capital to flee, but also a source for counterfeit currency to sell our legal tender for foreign exchange. First, Shanghai is an open port, and second, the government's exercise of power in Shanghai is currently subject to various restrictions. To eliminate the foreign exchange black market, it is almost impossible without the full cooperation of all friendly countries. Currently, the degree of cooperation between friendly countries and us is becoming increasingly close to the principle of foreign exchange control that is consistent with our national policy. The Hong Kong Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's decision to stop supplying the Shanghai black market with foreign exchange on the 7th of this month is one example of cooperation. The reason for this measure is nothing more than to curb Shanghai's unrestricted huge trade deficit and to prevent the use of Japanese and puppet currencies to buy our foreign exchange. This publication has repeatedly discussed this, so there is no need to elaborate further. Therefore, this new measure on foreign exchange is a necessary means of standing on the front line of automatic economic defense and is by no means a harbinger of currency system changes, as is thought by the short-sighted.</p>
<p>Now, let's further examine the impact of the foreign exchange contraction on the Shanghai market: first, the prices of purely foreign goods rise, then the prices of semi-national goods follow suit, and finally, even the prices of purely domestic goods take the opportunity to rise. Moreover, the upward trend does not distinguish between domestic and foreign goods, nor between luxury goods and daily necessities. For example, on June 6th, common glutinous rice in Changshu still only sold for 17.2 yuan per dan. Only ten days later, it had risen to around 22 yuan. The reason for this is that the sources of supply are abundant, and the reserves are also plentiful. Although the Tianjin incident caused some slight hoarding by the public, the main reason is that the floating capital in the market is flowing towards hoarding for speculation. These people who hold large amounts of floating capital are trying to take advantage of the foreign exchange price contraction to make a quick buck.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that this sharp contraction in foreign exchange is a deliberate attempt by the government to raise the prices of foreign luxury goods to stop people from wasting money. At the same time, it does not want the prices of daily necessities to rise, thereby increasing the hardship of the people. However, in Shanghai, due to the disconnection of political power, the government's originally perfect policy has been exploited by unscrupulous merchants blinded by profit. To combat these unscrupulous merchants, the government has made this decision to restrict withdrawals again.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's telegram roughly means that legal tender depositors are restricted to payments of more than 500 yuan per week. The excess can only be paid by interbank transfer. However, funds remitted to the interior are not subject to this restriction. A payment of 500 yuan in legal tender per week means that 2,000 yuan in legal tender can be used per month. This not only has no impact on the lives of general middle and lower-class depositors, but also does not cause any inconvenience to general stores. The only ones who are inconvenienced are speculators with large amounts of floating capital. Therefore, it is打击is打击the ambition of speculators, not all of their wealth. In other words, if they use their funds for legitimate purposes, if they seek legitimate profits, then the path is very broad. The implementation of this measure will undoubtedly stabilize prices, thereby allowing the general wage-earning class to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Look at the implementation of the Ministry of Finance's telegram, the black market gold price has fallen by more than 100 yuan, the US dollar has been extended by 1.625 yuan, and British exchange has grown to 7 pence. The foreign exchange that guarantees price increases has not contracted but has grown sharply. Is there any reason for prices to rise? Can unscrupulous merchants still misuse their floating capital to do evil? This wise measure can not only 打击the ambition of unscrupulous merchants to hoard goods and speculate, but also prevent the escape of national funds.</p>
<h3>Review and Prospect of the Sino-Japanese Currency War (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Anshi</p>
<p>4. The Intensification of the Recent Currency War in Central China and Japan's Failure</p>
<p>Since the legal tender showed no signs of spontaneous collapse, and the "loving protection" by Japanese "friendly nations" only increased its status day by day, some people recently advocated for a "new currency establishment theory." They believed that the legal tender was merely an inconvertible paper currency managed by the government. However, the reason why the people of Central China still trusted it was that there was no new currency sufficient to replace its circulation.</p>
<p>But how easy is it to issue a new currency to replace the legal tender? The legal tender can not only be used to buy foreign exchange, but also has no inflationary tendencies, making it hundreds of times better than any yarn coupon in the yen bloc, which cannot be exchanged for foreign exchange and is undergoing malignant inflation. Therefore, to defeat the legal tender, the new currency issued must have real value or be directly convertible into foreign exchange. However, this is not an easy task, and Japanese scholars and politicians have various different opinions on this:</p>
<p>Silver Coin Revival Theory</p>
<p>Initially, they focused on the fact that the legal tender could not be exchanged for silver and advocated for the revival of silver coins. This was because silver was nationalized, and a large amount of private silver was hidden among the people in China. According to statistics from some Japanese scholars, before the implementation of the legal tender system, China stored 285 million yuan of silver. During the implementation of the legal tender, 100 million yuan was exported overseas by the National Government, so there are still 185 million yuan of silver stored in China. In addition, Japan also has a considerable amount of silver in reserve. Based on these two, if a portion of the silver coins are issued in Central China first, the silver hidden in the interior of China will inevitably appear on the market. On the one hand, this will drive out the inconvertible legal tender, and on the other hand, it can please the United States, as this move will greatly benefit the US silver policy, they said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this free calculation has failed again.</p>
<p>First, the amount of silver currently hidden in the interior of China may not be as much as that. Some Japanese scholars estimate it to be only about 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Second, most of the hidden silver in the occupied areas has already been dug up and transported away by the Japanese, so where does this large amount of silver come from?</p>
<p>Third, the Japanese military force in the occupied areas is only at points and lines. For the vast guerrilla areas, the Japanese cannot make the hidden silver appear in society.</p>
<p>Fourth, even if silver coins are in circulation, it is absolutely impossible to make the hidden silver appear on the market in a short period of time. During World War I, China's silver was over-exported, resulting in a severe shortage of silver in major financial cities and an abnormal surge in interest rates. However, the hidden silver in the interior of China did not immediately flow out because of this. It only appeared on the market after a year or two: this is one proof. Moreover, during this time of war, it is even more impossible to flow out.</p>
<p>Fifth, in addition, the international relations in Central China are extremely complex, and it is difficult to guarantee that there is no risk of outflow. If strict and solid control is imposed to prohibit its outflow, it will also affect the value and effect of the silver coins themselves.</p>
<p>Sixth, as for trying to please the United States with this, the price paid is too small.</p>
<p>Seventh, finally, it should be noted that if the silver coin revival policy in Central China succeeds, not only the legal tender will be driven out, but also the Japanese yen and military scrip, which will accelerate the deterioration of inflation in Japan itself. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Domestic Sales of Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>— Tang Jun</p>
<p>Shanghai is undoubtedly a commercial center in our country. Whether it is export or import, most of them pass through here. Large quantities of our domestic raw materials and goods are transported to foreign countries, or large quantities of goods are ordered from foreign countries and then transported to other commercial ports in the country. Therefore, it is correct to say that Shanghai's commerce is the hub of our national industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The woolen fabric industry in Shanghai is naturally also regarded as the hub of our national woolen fabric industry! This can be proved by looking at the marketing situation of the woolen fabric industry in Shanghai for decades. In the past, most woolen fabric firms not only supplied the needs of consumers in the city, but also adjusted the needs of many other commercial ports in the country. Therefore, in the annual business figures of many woolen fabric firms, transactions with other ports accounted for half; when transportation and transportation were convenient, it would exceed this proportion. The marketing areas include Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Yantai, Jinan, etc. in North China; before the September 18th Incident, Liaoning, such as Shenyang and Yingkou, also had sales; in Central and South China, it was even wider, such as Hankou, Changsha, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Guilin, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Shantou, etc., with busy transactions every year, and Tianjin, Peiping, Qingdao, Hankou and other places had huge annual sales. The "January 28th" war gave a great blow to the sales of other ports! At that time, it was not only the woolen fabric industry, but also other industries such as hardware and cotton yarn, which also encountered the same situation! However, because the war ended soon, the woolen fabric industry and other industries generally resumed sales in other ports, and the situation did not decline much.</p>
<p>But finally, the all-out war of resistance against Japan on "August 13th" suddenly broke out in Shanghai! At that time, the woolen fabric industry was in the winter business season. Although Pingjin was in a state of tension, customers from Qinghan were coming to pick up goods one after another, so they had to suspend purchases; with the fierce progress of the war, in early September, even the sales of woolen fabrics in the city were stagnant! Many store employees also returned to their hometowns to avoid the war. By early December, when the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, the woolen fabric industry and other businesses generally started business, and sales in other ports were now completely absent, and many post offices were also closed, making transportation impossible; sales in the city were also extremely sluggish. During this period, the woolen fabric industry can only be said to be maintaining the store, and everyone was organizing their business after being frightened. In the following year, the postal transport on the Jinpu Line in Pingjinqing and other places was restored, and some goods were often distributed in North China; but no longer like before the war, they were loaded and sold in whole bolts and boxes, but only a few yards and sets, etc.; however, at that time, sales in Hankou and Wuchang suddenly became active: This was because our all-out war had expanded to the inner line of the Yangtze River, which created the abnormal prosperity of Wuhan. Some woolen fabric firms in Shanghai sent people to Wuhan via Ningbo and Wenzhou to "sit in" and try their best to supply spring and summer goods, so the domestic sales of the woolen fabric industry at that time almost became one-sided - to Wuhan. But finally, at the end of summer, Wuhan fell again, and sales in Wuhan disappeared again!</p>
<p>Since then, the domestic sales of woolen fabrics have become stagnant; now the postal transport in North China has almost been restored, and a few customers from Pingjinqinghan and other places have also come to Shanghai to pick up goods this spring; but the quantity has been reduced to half of that before the war, and Wuhan and other places are strictly sealed off by the Yangtze River, and sales are even more unpredictable. They all unanimously declared that British and American goods will soon have no place in North China and the Yangtze River! This is of course the inevitable result of being squeezed out. The future of domestic sales of woolen fabrics will certainly not escape this tragic fate!</p>
<h3>Finance  Rumors are Difficult to Dissipate, Cash Continues to Prosper, Unofficial Price Reaches 2,570 Yuan, Money Exchange Stores Collect 50-60 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market was sluggish due to the weekly holiday, so the outside market was difficult to dissipate due to certain rumors, and the gold price at noon on the previous day was more than 110 yuan lower than the black market US dollar exchange rate, so the industry was eager to prosper and was willing to buy at a high price, and the market was strong. According to unofficial prices, it has risen to 2,570 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan from the closing price at noon the day before yesterday, with few transactions. It is said that only money exchange stores collected 50-60 taels from the storefronts, but the selling price of money exchange stores was 2,580 yuan. The price of gold jewelry per tael was unchanged due to the holiday. Da Tong Hang still suspended the original price of 158 yuan, Xin Tong Hang was 256 yuan, and the purchase price was 148 yuan. Also, according to the London telegram on the 24th, British pure gold remained unchanged, and each ounce was still 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 pence.</p>
<h3>British Indian Silver Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 24th, a large bar of silver was bought by Indian seats, and there was a shortage of supply. The near and far months were increased by 1.875, and a small number of speculators sold out. Buyers were satisfied, and the market was flat. Also, according to the New York telegram, the spot price of American silver remained unchanged. According to the Bombay telegram, the spot price of Indian silver and the July futures both increased by two annas, and the August futures increased by five annas. The market situation is quite stable.</p>
<h3>Food  National Rice Weak in the Morning and Firm at Noon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of various gangs in Hebei still had no arrival. There were only 1,600 to 1,700 steamed buns. The market opened early, and the situation was still relaxed. However, until noon, the stores in this street were quite active, and there were also sales of inland gangs, so the market color recovered and became tight. As a result, the early and late markets were equal, which became a fixed situation. The quotations for thick and thin japonica rice and Duyang sharp rice remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>On "Strategy" in the Literary World</h3>
<p>— Tu Lao</p>
<p>Recently, a bookstore published a book specializing in the skills of lawyers. I only saw the advertisement in the newspaper, which said that the book is "a collection of the great achievements of lawyers' strategies, and is sufficient to assist literary writers."</p>
<p>This seems a bit strange, so I couldn't help but think about it.</p>
<p>In the past society, lawyers were indeed a class that relied on "strategy" to make a living. Their strategies were used not only in lawsuits, that is, using words to frame and slander, but also in practical plans. They could bribe officials, collude with gangsters, forge evidence, create rumors, and do other more terrible things.</p>
<p>However, since the advertisement says that it is "sufficient to assist literary writers," of course, the book only talks about "strategy" in words. There have also been special books on this aspect before, but most of them do not say the key to "strategy." This is still the old problem of the Chinese, everything must be "secret" to be suitable. However, in general, the key is always no more than two: the first is to give people nicknames, and the second is to talk about motives in everything.</p>
<p>Nickname is the so-called nickname. The method is: before writing out the crimes of the person being accused, first put a nickname on the name, such as "Giant-eyed Tai Sui" or "Big-headed Overlord," meaning that when officials see the name, they will first determine that he is not a good thing. "Motive" is a modern word, and the former term was called "intention." The method is: if the person being accused has one or two good deeds that everyone knows, it is said that his intention is to seek fame or fortune. In short, good is also bad, or even worse than the obvious bad. This trick is often used in counter-accusations.</p>
<p>But now the question is, what is the use of these "strategies" for "literary writers"? - In fact, in my opinion, the person who compiled the book really wasted his time, because some of our literary writers have already learned these "strategies."</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, you might as well check the old and new accounts in the literary world. The "nickname school" has been popular for a period of time, and the "intention school" has been popular all the time, and it has not declined yet. And the most common thing is that when you are criticized to the point where you have no way out, you suddenly become an X-ray and say that you can see the "motive" of the critic. This is exactly the trick of the counter-accusation.</p>
<p>However, according to experience, this kind of lawyer's writing style really cannot "help" "literary writers." Although the "nickname school" has been popular, it has disappeared without a trace. The reason is: since you have hung the sign of a "literary writer," you always have to take care of the "face" of the article and are unwilling to give the other party nicknames such as "Giant-eyed Tai Sui" or "Big-headed Overlord," and in fact the other party is also a literary writer, and can never be bad to the point of "Tai Sui" or "Overlord," so the nicknames can only be limited to "individualist" or "pessimist." But this is really too broad. The person who receives it does not feel attacked, and the person who hears it feels very ordinary, so it is finished as soon as it is written out, and the effect is not obtained at all. The "intention school" has been maintained for a relatively long time, but in the end it still doesn't work. For example, when a writer is defending himself, he can say that the person who criticizes him is "seeking something unsuccessful" or "taking private revenge." This seems moving, but in fact it is difficult to attract the attention of a third party. Because since you are a writer, the main thing is of course the words, and everyone only looks at whether the critic's criticism of your words is correct. After all, the intention is difficult to grasp, and there is really no need to care about such a bird thing. Moreover, this will also make you lose your dignity, and the reader will suspect that you and the critic are of different genders, and that one has asked you for something that has not been achieved, so you come to "retaliate." - This is called tricking yourself.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how brilliant the lawyer's writing style is, literary writers really cannot benefit from it.</p>
<p>As for the actual "strategy" outside of words, some of our literary writers seem to have tried it a bit, but the effect is also very limited. The reason is very simple: after all, the literary world is not a government office. After playing around, in the end, it will always be exposed.</p>
<p>If you can reject the "strategy" of the lawyer style, literary writers may have some hope.</p>
<h3>Going to the Front Line</h3>
<p>— Ling Yunlong</p>
<h3>Burning Red Chain Snake (1)</h3>
<p>— Ming Zhi</p>
<p>——Grandma's Story——</p>
<p>Due to Qian Asen's notification, the threshing ground was busy for a while. Qian Asen said that Li Yugen told him last night, "They" will go to the countryside to "search" today and will pass through here.</p>
<p>Captain Wang Yuan was leading us to thresh wheat at Grandma's house. When he heard this news, he gathered us to discuss countermeasures. Because "they" were very numerous, about eighty or ninety, we decided according to custom not to confront "them" directly and temporarily dispersed to Qinshan in the back.</p>
<p>"Okay," Grandma said, wiping the sweat from her forehead, "you go, I'll take care of everything here. When they come and go, you can go down the mountain and come back."</p>
<p>"How can we know when "they" come and go?" Captain Wang asked.</p>
<p>"You just need to see smoke rising from the ground here, that means "they" are coming; when the smoke stops, that means "they" are leaving." She also said to her son and daughter-in-law, "You also go, just let A Ming accompany me." A Ming is her grandson.</p>
<p>While Captain Wang was supervising us to pack up in the house, Grandma's family and Qian Asen were all carrying wheat husks and broken wheat stalks to the southwest corner of the ground and piling them up.</p>
<p>We went up the mountain, Qian Asen also returned to Qingzhen, and only Grandma and A Ming were left on the ground.</p>
<p>We put sentries at the foot of the mountain, and most of the people hid in the woods on the hillside. Everyone was holding their weapons and preparing for "them" to rush up.</p>
<p>Li Jingen met "them" not far from leaving Wangjia Village. After being interrogated, searched, and beaten by "them," there were no other accidents.</p>
<p>When Grandma saw "them" gradually entering the village, she went to light the wheat husk pile and let it simmer. It seemed that someone inside "them" was giving orders, and for this small village, "they" also had to fulfill the responsibility of going to the countryside. So a small part of the people entered the house to "search," and most of the people sat down under the tree to rest.</p>
<p>"Hey, old woman," a man in white cloth shorts shouted at Grandma, "you come over, I want to ask you."</p>
<p>Grandma walked over with a flail in her hand, and A Ming followed behind her. They both looked very calm, and it seemed that even if someone entered their house, it was not worth their attention.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Grandma wiped the sweat from her clothes.</p>
<p>"Are there any Yunji teams here?"</p>
<p>""Oil Salt Beans" are fried in every house."</p>
<p>"It's not some "bean." I'm asking if there are any bandits here."</p>
<p>"There have never been any bandits here, only robbers from outside."</p>
<p>"Where are the robbers?"</p>
<p>"They don't live here, they come and go."</p>
<p>"What do they rob?"</p>
<p>"They take whatever they see, and even people."</p>
<p>She chatted with that person for a while, and seeing that there was nothing going on, she went back to threshing wheat.</p>
<p>The people who went into the house to "search" did not come out, and several more people went in. The man in white cloth shorts seemed a little bored, so he stood up and looked around. He saw the simmering pile of wheat husks and shouted at Grandma again:</p>
<p>"Hey, old woman, you come over, I still want to ask you."</p>
<p>Grandma pretended not to hear and ignored him.</p>
<p>"Hey, old woman, what are you burning there?" He walked over, looking somewhat kind.</p>
<p>Grandma said loudly: "I'm burning red chain snakes there!"</p>
<p>"Red chain snakes? Where did the red chain snakes come from?" He clearly wanted to find something to talk about.</p>
<p>"I don't know where the red chain snakes came from!" Grandma put down the flail and said, "But they are not local, because there have never been any here. They have only been discovered recently."</p>
<p>"Are they big?" He was obviously like most people, and liked to talk about snakes.</p>
<p>"How can they not be big; the big ones are like arms, and the small ones are like fingers."</p>
<p>"Are there many?"</p>
<p>"How can there not be many; sometimes there are dozens, sometimes there are one or two. They often come. It is said that in some places, thousands and thousands have been discovered!"</p>
<p>"Has anyone been bitten to death?"</p>
<h3>An Impressionistic Journey (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>The little monk called us to drink tea, eat some porridge, and borrowed three padded kasayas to put on. The morning was indeed cold, and the wind was strong. The eastern area still only had a hint of silvery white.</p>
<p>Along the road leading further up, a hundred steps or so, and then turning east, I discovered a platform that was slightly decorated and built, facing the eastern mountain ridge. We walked up to it, wrapped ourselves tightly in the kasayas, and huddled in the stone pavilion, waiting for the appearance of the morning glow.</p>
<p>This is truly a meaningless, boring task for scholars. Perhaps a god will emerge from the scene of the rising sun, sprinkling a few drops of immortal dew on them? I was first misled by this amazing agitation to come to the mountain, but immediately discovered the ordinariness of the event - in our hometown... Furong Village, Jiufeng Pass, Banzhu Ao, Xiaoxia Mountain and other small areas, you can appreciate the same type of scene. The slight difference is that Mount Heng is higher, the dew is thicker, because the scenery is covered by fog, and the glow seems more illusory, and the surroundings of the rising sun seem more chaotic and mysterious. This is not unusual. However, as a thrilling object for gentlemen and ladies who do not leave the capital, it can be somewhat justified.</p>
<p>I persuaded the two Pengs not to linger any longer. Coming down the platform, we went nearby to take a look at the Shengdi Temple, which stands on the highest peak.</p>
<p>Shengdi Temple is a desolate, isolated stone house, built on a pile of stacked boulders. The pillars are stone, the ground is stone, the walls are also stone, and almost the only monk inside is as cold and lifeless as a stone. He does not meditate, nor does he chant scriptures, nor does he take care of guests, but just sits silently by the door, staring blankly at the ground, holding wooden beads in his hand.</p>
<p>Ten</p>
<p>We returned to the foot of the mountain via West Ma Road.</p>
<p>Passing by the Sutra Depository, we spent half an hour loitering and chatted with a monk from Hubei. The construction of the Sutra Depository is still new, and the books on display are also recent versions, but there is not a single one who understands the scriptures. The Hubei monk claimed to be "nurturing his nature," and it turned out that he did not even understand the birth and calendar of Shakyamuni.</p>
<p>Passing by the Mirror Terrace, we discovered some empty houses nearby. According to passers-by, it was Zhang Xueliang's secluded residence. Several people with box cannons were standing at the door, telling us that we could not enter this place.</p>
<p>What we passed by later were some mountainous areas with lush trees, some temples, villas, and schools. Because we were rushing for the 1:00 pm bus, we did not stay any longer. Hastily, like this article, it ended. I don't want to transcribe and describe anything rigidly, I just need to say these short impressions. (End)</p>
<h3>I Want to Wake Up</h3>
<p>— Jun Bo</p>
<p>I am lonely, I live in a lonely dream every day. I am used to using the pen of thought to paint a beautiful picture.</p>
<p>Dreams are my familiar companions, and I have never been frustrated in a dream. When I feel sad, or a little depressed, then I will lock my breath in the deep valley of sweet dreams, and wait quietly for that warm hand to wipe away a piece of autumn in my heart.</p>
<p>Dreams are lonely, and I have had many lonely dreams. Sometimes I feel tired after pain, so I might as well drink a glass of lonely wine. Watching the water droplets on the eaves; listening to the subtle wind passing over the maple tips in the courtyard; I begin to imagine many golden stories, and then fall into a lonely dream. I see my shadow accompanied by the laughter of the past; perhaps I still touch the lost warmth. No curses; no resentment; I hold the memory of dreams tightly, and there is lonely joy in dreams.</p>
<p>Towards the vast horizon, I call for the years that have passed. My heart is painful. Unintentionally waving my hand, borrowing the wings of the sky goose, I grope and fly to the road in my dream again. "There are no years in dreams," and I laugh lonely again. Laughter is lonely, who accompanies it? Except for the water droplets on the eaves, the subtle wind in the courtyard.</p>
<p>So, I cried in pain. The heart that had been defiled by dreams suddenly became cold again. Rubbing my eyes, I said, "Dreams are empty, aren't they just a fleeting illusion?"</p>
<p>Reaching out to embrace the vast world, I don't want to dream anymore. The sadness after dreams is enough to torture me. I will quickly take advantage of the flames of war in this reality, muster up a healthy spirit, and bathe in the storms of the times.</p>
<p>Really, I want to wake up, and never pursue that golden lie again!</p>
<h3>A Song in Sickness</h3>
<p>— Guo Nidi</p>
<p>The sword at the head of the bed is whistling;</p>
<p>My love!</p>
<p>Unsheathe it for me! Sword,</p>
<p>In the past you were painted with</p>
<p>Glorious pages of history;</p>
<p>But over the years</p>
<p>Let mottled rust bloom</p>
<p>And remain unheard!</p>
<p>Having experienced so many melancholic winds and rains,</p>
<p>Now, you are finally uneasy with</p>
<p>The coldness of the past,</p>
<p>Breaking out and whistling!</p>
<p>(And I am uneasy with</p>
<p>The cramped bed!)</p>
<p>You are shooting with a chilling cold light,</p>
<p>I will rise up because of you!</p>
<p>I often compare myself to</p>
<p>An Arab of the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>A disciple of Muhammad:</p>
<p>One hand holding the scriptures,</p>
<p>The other hand holding you!</p>
<p>You are already my indispensable companion,</p>
<p>I want to wear you,</p>
<p>And ride to the distance!</p>
<p>Tonight, the blood of ancestors</p>
<p>Is boiling fiercely throughout my body!</p>
<p>Shouting the names of the haters,</p>
<p>Crying and laughing come with it!</p>
<p>My love,</p>
<p>Unsheathe it for me;</p>
<p>The sword at the head of the bed is whistling!</p>
<h3>Talk More</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>This journal refuses to start "pen wars" with other journals, and it has been stated repeatedly. However, this journal also refuses to "speak out for justice" or "defend injustice" after reading the "pen wars" between other journals. This is not out of fear, but I always feel that "pen wars" at this time will disrupt the pace of unity against the outside world, and besides, what is being fought for is often the emotional impulses of one or two people. Mr. Ting Lihei's article is very good, so I have to reluctantly give it up. If you want to return it, please notify me and I will do so immediately.</p>

<h3>Four-Year-Old Prodigy’s Tiger Calligraphy</h3>
<p>Zhou Yunqing, a child from Fuyang, is the fifth-generation grandson of Observer Yun Gao. From the time he was in swaddling clothes, he enjoyed looking at characters. This year he is only four years old, yet he truly loves brushes and ink. He spends his days drawing and scribbling, often drawing bricks and writing characters as a form of play. During the Dragon Boat Festival, his grandfather, Yun Sun, instructed him to write the characters for "vermilion tiger." A large piece of paper was laid out on the table, and the child was made to stand on the table. He began writing with the brush as if divinely inspired, producing several sheets of calligraphy and signing his name. The event became a popular topic of conversation among relatives and friends, and the name of the child prodigy spread widely! His calligraphy has already been appreciated by Magistrate Yao of Fuyang and sent to Hangzhou to be engraved by craftsmen. From the time the "Moon" was called until now, the number of plaques and couplets written for officials and gentry in Hangzhou, Fuyang, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Huzhou is countless.</p>

<p>Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee Inaugural Special Issue</p>
<p>— Yuan Xilian</p>
<h3>General Overview and Humble Opinion of This Association</h3>
<p>— Gu Kemin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, recognizing that the summer season is approaching and that diseases are easily spread, and that the health issues of refugees urgently need to be resolved, convened a meeting on the sixth of this month with the five associations of physicians, new medicines, pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical groups, and pharmacies, as well as the Chinese Federation, YMCA, Jingwu Athletic Association, Silver and Money Industry Association, and other groups to discuss solutions. Representatives present included Ye Zhisheng, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Xiangsun, Gao Peiliang, Sun Yuancheng, Zhou Shiluo, Zhou Mengbai, Zhu Yuquan, Tu Kaizheng, Fang Zuyin, Ying Tianhe, Huang Weiqing, Chen Guili, Zhu Hegao, Yu Yongsui, Chen Minghua, Gao Ziwen, Li Kangnian, Qiu Yanling, Tao Ran, Cen Zhiliang, and myself, along with Mr. Fang Jiaobo, Mr. Xi Yushu, and Mr. Jiang Shangfeng from the association. All agreed that the three major issues of clothing, food, and shelter for the refugees gathered in Shanghai have been somewhat maintained through the generous donations of people from all walks of life. However, if cholera and other epidemic diseases were to break out due to unsanitary living conditions, it would be a disaster. If precautions are not taken, the harm would be unimaginable. Therefore, it was proposed that the various groups jointly establish a Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee to solicit donations for use in prevention and treatment. It was decided to hold an inaugural meeting on the twelfth. At the meeting, chaired by Mr. Fang Jiaobo, eight articles of the organizational outline for the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee were adopted, with the aim of assisting the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association in fundraising for health expenses. The goal is to raise 50,000 yuan. For every yuan donated, in addition to issuing a receipt, a "Philanthropy Medal" will be awarded. Various groups will be responsible for fundraising. Starting from the 26th of this month, one chairman, two vice-chairmen, and twenty-five to thirty-five executive committee members, an unlimited number of committee members, several advisory committee members, one general secretary, and two deputy general secretaries will be elected. I was nominated as chairman, but considering my lack of talent and knowledge, I felt unqualified and immediately declined. However, the committee members argued that this is a charitable cause, and being nominated as chairman is a voluntary position, so I should not decline but accept the responsibility. Persuaded by their arguments and sense of duty, I had to withdraw my declination and follow the gentlemen in their efforts. Consequently, two executive committee meetings and one cadre meeting were held within three days, the 17th, 19th, and 20th. Nine articles of incentive measures were adopted, and it was decided that fundraising methods should be tailored to each participating group and implemented accordingly. The set donation amount is the minimum, and more is always welcome. It was also proposed to the association that the health funds raised by this committee should not be exclusively used for refugees in shelters but should also be used to treat poor citizens suffering from epidemic diseases, regardless of their origin, to prevent further spread. Furthermore, prominent figures from all walks of life, known for their enthusiasm for public welfare and good reputation, were invited to serve as advisory committee members to provide guidance and make up for any shortcomings. On the occasion of launching this special fundraising issue today, I have briefly described the past events of this committee and my willingness to follow the gentlemen and advocate for this cause, despite my limited abilities. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will consider the potential for epidemic diseases and the urgent need for prevention, and generously donate to support this charitable cause and accumulate blessings.</p>

<h3>Declaration of This Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee is jointly formed by ten groups, including the Physicians' Association, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, the New Medicine Industry Association, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Association, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry Association, the Chinese Federation, the Tongle Association, the Jingwu Athletic Association, the YMCA, and the Silver and Money Industry Amateur Friendship Association. It was established on the twelfth of this month, adopted its organizational outline, elected committee members, and assigned them to their respective tasks to work together. This is because epidemics are prone to occur during the summer season, and it is necessary to take preventive measures. Refugees in shelters in this city should be given special attention, and the residents of the two concessions, which number up to four or five million, have seen an unprecedented surge in population. Due to the shortage of housing, many are crammed into small rooms. In this hot weather, epidemics are inevitable and should be prevented and treated equally. Therefore, for the sake of preparedness, the city's health matters must be planned comprehensively and the scope expanded. Health facilities, including the purchase of necessary medicines and the establishment of more temporary epidemic hospitals, are the main priorities, and raising funds is the most urgent task. This is the reason for organizing the Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee.</p>
<p>We believe that preventing disasters and alleviating suffering is a public good that benefits the community, and that donating generously to help those in need is a manifestation of our shared conscience. We hope that everyone will contribute enthusiastically and support this charitable cause, so that relief efforts can be completed. This will not only benefit the poor and needy but also ensure the peace and safety of all residents. This declaration is hereby issued for your consideration.</p>
<h3>We Should Pay Attention to the Hygiene of the Entire Society</h3>
<p>— Yuan Hesong</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, and summer is the season for epidemic diseases.</p>
<p>In previous years, the Shanghai epidemics would always rage to the point where several epidemic hospitals were overwhelmed; now, after the war and with a surge in population in the small concessions, epidemics and other diseases are bound to be more rampant than in previous years, and this is predictable.</p>
<p>The demons of epidemics and other diseases certainly do not discriminate by class, and they will trouble the rich and poor alike; however, the fact is that the wealthy class suffers less from epidemics than the poor class. The reason is that the wealthy class can afford to pay attention to hygiene, live in spacious houses, and eat clean food, so the demons of disease have no chance to invade; while the poor class lives in overcrowded conditions and eats only to fill their stomachs. Material conditions limit them, and they cannot afford to pay attention to hygiene, so the demons of disease often have the opportunity to invade. However, on the current isolated island, the cost of living is rising day by day, and it is already difficult for the poor to make a living. If they unfortunately fall ill, where will they find the money for treatment? Therefore, the Relief Association and the enthusiastic people from various groups, with their compassionate and altruistic hearts, launched a campaign to raise health funds to help patients who cannot afford medical expenses, which is a truly urgent and meaningful endeavor.</p>
<p>It is well known that people with the means to donate to charity are doing a benevolent and righteous act that benefits others and the world, so at this time, everyone should generously donate and participate in this great cause; however, I believe that when we are able to donate to charity, it is not only benefiting others but also benefiting ourselves, and I can give an example.</p>
<p>There was a student who, after returning from studying abroad, had fully adopted a Western lifestyle and was very particular about hygiene. He thought the air in the city was not as good as in the suburbs, so he built a Western-style house in the suburbs. The structure of the house was not only exquisite but also equipped with hygienic facilities everywhere, with windows all around, screens installed, flush toilets, porcelain bathtubs, and gutters around the house, which were often sprinkled with disinfectant. However, he later fell ill, and his family members were often sick. The reason was that although his Western-style house and his family were particular about hygiene, the people around him were not, and the stench of fertilizer from the fields and people's irrigation would ruthlessly permeate his Western-style house, and the microorganisms could not be stopped by the screens.</p>
<p>From this example, we can see that it is useless to try to live well if the environment is not good. We must first pay attention to the hygiene of the entire society so that we are not affected. Therefore, as the saying goes, "Saving others is saving yourself." Therefore, in addition to acting with a compassionate heart and having those with the means donate money to engage in this relief effort, we should also understand that saving others is saving ourselves, and donate even more generously to cope with this season of epidemic diseases, so that this season of epidemic diseases can pass peacefully and that all people on this isolated island can survive this dangerous season!</p>
<h3>Motivation and Purpose</h3>
<p>— Xi Yushu</p>
<p>Shanghai is the premier commercial port in China, with a dense population. Since the war, the number of people fleeing to Shanghai from war zones has been incessant, and the population has increased dramatically. As many as 4.5 million people live in just a few square kilometers in the central and western districts of the French Concession and the Public Concession, setting an unprecedented record for population density in cities around the world. In normal times, there are more than 250 deaths per day, so the establishment of funeral homes, although sprouting up like bamboo shoots after a rain, is still insufficient. As for the number of sick people, it is even more alarming. The overcrowding of hospitals gives us a general idea. Now that summer has arrived, if we do not plan ahead for such a large population, once an epidemic breaks out, the sick will have no way to seek medical treatment, deaths will inevitably increase, and transmission will be even more difficult to prevent. If a virulent epidemic breaks out, thousands of people will die every day, which is by no means unexpected. How frightening it is! The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, aware of this, is specifically raising health funds to purchase more medicines and medical equipment, establish more clinics, achieve the effect of prevention and treatment, reduce mortality, protect the health of refugees, and ensure the safety of residents. This is indeed an urgent task that responds to the needs of the time. We believe that there is no shortage of virtuous gentlemen in Shanghai who will enthusiastically support this charitable cause.</p>
<h3>Incentives for Donations</h3>
<p>(1) For every one yuan donated in legal tender, a Philanthropy Medal will be awarded.</p>
<p>(2) For those who donate 100 yuan or more in legal tender, a pair of eyeglass frames from the chairman of the association will be given.</p>
<p>(3) For those who donate 300 yuan or more in legal tender, a commemorative silver shield will be given.</p>
<p>(4) For those who donate 500 yuan or more in legal tender, a commemorative silver shield will be given, plus a complete set of couplets handwritten by the chairman of the association.</p>
<p>(5) For those who donate 1,000 yuan or more in legal tender, a commemorative plaque from the association will be given.</p>
<p>(6) For those who raise 200 yuan or more in legal tender, a pair of eyeglass frames from the chairman of the association will be given.</p>
<p>(7) For those who raise 500 yuan or more in legal tender, a commemorative silver shield will be given.</p>
<p>(8) For those who raise 1,000 yuan or more in legal tender, a commemorative silver shield will be given, plus a complete set of couplets handwritten by the chairman of the association.</p>
<p>(9) For those who raise 2,000 yuan or more in legal tender, a plaque from the association will be given.</p>
<h3>A Word for Those Who Donate to the Health of Fellow Citizens</h3>
<p>— Ye Chunhua</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident, charitable organizations in this city arose to organize refugee relief agencies. Subsequently, as the situation on the ground became increasingly tense, in order to concentrate relief efforts and unify the management of the agencies, the charitable organizations jointly formed the Shanghai Relief Committee, first in Renji Hall and then in Pudong Building, to handle all relief matters. Initially, five refugee camps were established to accommodate more than 500 refugees. Later, as the war zone gradually expanded and the number of refugees increased, almost all schools, playgrounds, agencies, and temples were used as camps, but the number of refugees reached hundreds of thousands, so there was still a shortage of space. Therefore, a way was found to send some of them back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>In the past, regarding the health problems of refugees, the initial measures were nothing more than setting up medical teams in each camp. If diseases were discovered, minor cases were treated by volunteer doctors, and serious cases were sent to refugee hospitals. At the same time, the refugees' physical condition was checked to prevent the spread of disease. The health authorities of both concessions also sent doctors to each camp to vaccinate the refugees and administer vaccinations. If someone died of illness, a burial team was formed to coffin and bury the body. In short, the philanthropists of this city have done their best to care for the refugees from birth to death, recognizing the necessity of solidarity in the entire society.</p>
<p>Recently, the Refugee Relief Association has also established a Fundraising for Health Expenses Committee, with the aim of raising 50,000 to 100,000 yuan for health expenses. There are currently more than 4 million residents in Shanghai, so this small amount should not be difficult to raise. The motivation of those who donate generously is humane, and I know that this undertaking will surely be completed soon.</p>
<p>There are more than 70,000 refugees, which is not a small number. If an epidemic were to break out and spread to the public, it would not be good for the people of Shanghai. Therefore, rather than waiting to be overwhelmed, it is better to pool our resources and efforts to benefit ourselves and others. There is no shortage of benevolent people in Shanghai, and I hope that they will take the lead and make this righteous cause a success, which would not only be a blessing for the more than 70,000 refugees but also for the more than 4 million citizens.</p>

<h3>A Three-Hour Tour of Zhabei</h3>
<p>— Bo Ming</p>
<p>Within sight of the foreign concessions of Shanghai, once densely populated with a million people, but now filled with scorched wood and dilapidated walls, lies Zhabei, which fell on October 27th, a few days before the Chinese army abandoned the Shanghai area two years ago. Counting on our fingers, the Japanese have occupied the area for nineteen months. In theory, they could have implemented their ambitious and widely publicized plans for municipal improvement and economic development.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I returned to Zhabei and lingered for several hours. The scene that met my eyes was even more depressing than what I saw during my last visit to Zhabei on a gloomy winter day two years ago. At that time, the portion of the public concession occupied by the Japanese army and Zhabei were almost indistinguishable because both areas were desolate and permeated with the aura of death. Now, however, the bustling liveliness of the public concession and the deathly silence of Zhabei have become a stark contrast.</p>
<p>In the nineteen months since the fall of Zhabei, the Japanese have not begun to change its scarred appearance. The shell craters of that time still dot the rubble-strewn streets. Walls riddled with machine-gun fire like beehives still stand by the roadside, teetering precariously. The Chinese army's fortifications still exist, but the sandbags are slightly damaged. Peering through the half-closed doorways, one can see straight through to the street.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press's million-dollar factory has one wall leaning outward towards the nearby trench. The factory is surrounded by barbed wire. The tank traps in front have been filled in to allow military trucks to occasionally pass through. Baoshan Road, which was commercially bustling and crowded with pedestrians two years ago, now reminds one of a ghost market, except that the ghost market does not have shell holes on the sidewalks.</p>
<p>The North Railway Station, which has been destroyed twice by the Japanese aggressors in five years, has been rebuilt. However, foreign eyes cannot glimpse its secrets because it is now surrounded by high concrete walls, electrified fences, and barbed-wire obstacles. Facing the public concession, there is also a brand-new concrete underground bunker, which is used for unforeseen circumstances. Only one entrance is left for entering and exiting the North Station. Stern-faced Japanese military police stand there, carefully watching the frightened Chinese taking the train.</p>
<p>I recalled that in October two years ago, from a dilapidated house on the boundary road of the concession, I looked at the North Station a hundred yards away. I saw Japanese planes lazily circling in the sky above the North Station, dropping huge bombs. Below were Chinese soldiers wearing conical straw hats, perhaps newly arrived reinforcements from Guangxi. Because the distance was very close, I could see the features on each of their faces. Every time a plane dropped a bomb, they would lie flat on the ground. In an instant, with a bang, it was deafening, and splinters and dust flew up. After the bombs exploded, these soldiers immediately continued their duties calmly, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Now, only the occasional hoarse shouts of Japanese sailors in the nearby Lianglu Building and the sound of streetcar bells in the public concession break the deathly silence. The Lianglu Building, built in 1935 and 1936, still stands tall. Windows have been installed on the second and third floors, which have been converted into barracks for Japanese sailors. This building is also surrounded by high fences, and sentries guard the gates. Other than that, the Japanese have left this building to its own devices. On the gray walls, there are still blackened holes, and the bricks loosened by the intensive three-month bombardment by the Japanese army, navy, and air force have not been removed. In some places, the steel bars in the ruins can still be seen.</p>
<p>The wooden buildings surrounding the Lianglu Building bore the brunt of the Japanese air raids. A group of Chinese coolies, supervised by the Japanese, are now dismantling the remaining wood. In the entire Zhabei area, I only saw three groups of coolies. One group was demolishing a half-destroyed church, neatly stacking the bricks, perhaps for the construction of buildings the Japanese want to build. Apart from these coolies and the Chinese in a public bus waving their passes to the Japanese sentries at the intersection of Shishan Road and Shixing Road, I saw fewer than twenty Chinese in Zhabei in three hours.</p>
<p>However, although the Chinese residents of Zhabei have decreased, they have not disappeared. On every major road, especially on Baoxing Road, a wary sentry stands every fifty yards, secretly peering at every person and vehicle passing by from behind trees, corners of houses, and obstacles. On the bridge, a small team of patrolling sailors carefully checks the passes of several farmers crossing the bridge. Why is Zhabei, which has been occupied for nineteen months, still so heavily guarded, like an armed camp? Is it because Zhabei is the front door to the Japanese military base in the concession? Or is it because of fear of attacks by the guerrilla forces known overseas? This is not difficult to understand.</p>
<p>If the Japanese had the funds and opportunity to start economic revitalization, then Zhabei, Shanghai's "Little Tokyo," would certainly be an ideal place for such a plan. Within a mile of Zhabei, there is a port where Japan can continuously transport in construction materials. In Shanghai itself, there are thousands of laborers looking for work, and many people are eager to return to their hometowns. In "Little Tokyo," there is unrestricted management and a supply of technical knowledge. Furthermore, Japan has concentrated a large number of army, navy, and air force soldiers, planes, and warships in the entire Shanghai area, which is sufficient to protect Zhabei from attacks by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Then, how can we explain why Japan has not yet started its widely publicized plan? The answer lies in Japan's entire economic and political activities in China, which is that Japan now realizes that its "sacred mission" of conquering and pacifying China is beyond its capabilities.</p>
<p>Nearly two years ago, when Japan started the current war, its original plan was to strengthen its power in North China by flaunting its military strength. However, China, fighting desperately, responded to Japan's challenge, and the war spread to Shanghai. One incident led to another, and a major war broke out, which was truly Japan's misfortune. As the war expanded, Japan's required expenses increased, and today, its total amount is equal to the entire national revenue of Japan. At the same time, the funds that can be obtained are absorbed by heavy industry. The funds that could be used for the economic development of North China two years ago have now been exhausted and empty. Therefore, it has to frequently issue astonishing news, such as Tokyo hinting that it has formulated an economic plan for North China.</p>
<p>Even more important than this is that without the cooperation of the hundreds of millions of Chinese living in the so-called "occupied areas," no kind of revival is possible. Unfortunately for Japan, its army has not yet won the favor of the masses. The Japanese army continues to carry out terrible wars, causing China's hatred of the invaders to grow with new strength. This can be proved by the increasingly widespread guerrilla warfare and the increasing number of Japanese troops dispatched, who still shout slogans such as "pacifying the occupied areas." Alas! The devastated Zhabei is enough to make Japan realize that engaging in aggression is futile and an ominous sign of future tragic consequences!

<h3>A Record of the "Hualian Tonglehui" (Chinese United Recreation Club)</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Since the retreat of the national army in Songhu (Shanghai), Shanghai has formed a so-called "isolated island." It is indeed very difficult for young people in various professions to find a proper place to adjust their bodies and minds in this small place and in this special environment. The pre-war mass organizations have all stagnated or disintegrated due to the sound of war. Therefore, those with weak wills are confused by boring pastimes, playing and messing around in singing halls and dance halls all day and night to kill time. This is really a large number. At that time, Mr. Lu Fu, Zhang Yuanfu, Liang Jueyu and other gentlemen felt that under this situation, there was indeed a need to organize an amateur and proper entertainment group. After several preparations, the "Hualian Tonglehui" was finally created. Its main purpose is to connect feelings, research academics, cultivate body and mind, improve life, promote proper entertainment, and promote welfare undertakings.</p>
<p>In the short one-year history from its founding to the present, the "Hualianhui" has also encountered countless difficulties. However, it is willing to work hard and strive, so it finally survived all the storms. The members increased from more than one hundred to more than two thousand to more than four thousand. The venue changed from one wing room to the third floor of Lichang Trading Company on Jiujiang Road to No. 194 Nanjing Road. Almost every moment, it is progressing and expanding. Now, among the general people in society, especially in the "foreign company" circle, it is probably rare for people who do not know the three words "Hualianhui."</p>
<p>In fact, the "Hualianhui" is a good amateur entertainment venue for young people in the workplace. After you have finished a day's boring work, do you feel tired and bored? At this time, you can run to the entertainment department of the "Hualianhui" to relax. It is divided into eight categories: national music, Cantonese music, vocal music, harmonica, chess, magic, drama, and Peking opera. Do you want to improve your knowledge? The "Hualianhui" also has an academic department. In addition to a library and a "weekly academic lecture," "life symposium," and "literary lecture," there is also a "Hualian Amateur Tutoring School" attached to the Zhengxing Girls' School on Fuxu Road. If you want to exercise your body, the "Hualianhui" also has a sports department. Ping pong, volleyball, basketball and various sports are all included. In the past, because the venue had not been resolved, the work of the sports department was not very tense, but recently, its situation has been very active. In a nutshell, we can say that the purpose of the "Hualianhui" is not only to eliminate our bad habits and abolish all kinds of wasteful vulgarities, but also to try our best to provide us with opportunities to increase our knowledge and exercise our bodies.</p>
<p>By the way, there are three things about the "Hualianhui" that are worth mentioning here: (1) The establishment of the women's department. In most groups in Shanghai, there are very few women participating in activities, but the female members of the "Hualianhui" seem to be particularly many. Therefore, there is this women's department to specialize in the affairs of female members. Its work in education includes cooking research classes and life knowledge classes. In terms of crafts, there are sewing, embroidery, and knitting. (2) The operation of the consumer cooperative. In this department, in addition to the ordinary catering department and billiard room, the "Hualianhui" also specially provides many stores, giving members a special purchase discount and preferential treatment to reduce the burden of life for each member. (3) The establishment of the refugee relief committee. In order to share some of the responsibility of relieving refugees, the "Hualianhui" established this special committee to carry out the work.</p>
<p>Of course, the "Hualian Tonglehui" still has many shortcomings that have not been overcome. However, in general, the work of the "Hualian Tonglehui" is worthy of our support.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Encouraging Learning and Agriculture to Store Materials for the Country; Retaining the Strong and Eliminating the Weak to Select Seeds with a Field</p>
<p>Village Chief Zhu's words were like a lecture, and everyone listened respectfully. Later, they talked about the land. Village Chief Zhu said: "We only lease the land here, we don't sell it. Since the establishment of the new village, all the land in the village belongs to the village. If you want to use the land in the village, you can only lease it from the village, and you are not allowed to buy it. All the land in the village is priced by the village council. It is stipulated that a certain place should collect a certain amount of rent per mu per year. However, the land is good and bad, and it cannot be the same. Places with convenient land and water transportation are naturally more expensive. Places with only land transportation but no water transportation are slightly less. Places on the mountainside where the road has not been built are certainly less expensive. There is a booklet in the village office that has a detailed map of the entire village. It is marked in detail that a certain place is the best and the rent is the highest; a certain place is medium and the rent is less; a certain place is the worst and the rent is even less. The term of land lease cannot be fixed, probably the longest is thirty years, some are twenty-five years, some are twenty years, and the shortest is fifteen years. Generally, twenty years is the most common. However, because of the progress of village governance and the development of the environment, after ten years, a re-evaluation is allowed, which is based on fairness and does not have any prejudice. Now, you two young ladies have come here to take a look, and you have a rough idea of the situation. I think you always want a place with convenient land and water transportation. How many mu of land do you want? In addition to the factory building, do you want to build other ancillary buildings? This cannot be decided in one day. On the one hand, report to your father, is the address here suitable? On the other hand, you can ask an architect to come and take a look, which will be more thorough." He Shuangyu said: "Yes! According to the wishes of the two of us, it would be best to set up a factory on the road. I think my father will not object. Originally, when my father went north, he knew that we were going to visit Sister Airen. He told us to take the opportunity to come here, and if there is a suitable address, build a few houses to live in. Because we may not return to Guangdong for a while, and my father dislikes the Shanghai market being too noisy, which is not very suitable for living in. However, because of his professional relationship, he cannot be too far away from the seven seas. So, we initially wanted to discuss with Sister Airen to choose a place with beautiful mountains and rivers, and build a small villa, and felt that the Ziyouli (Freedom) New Village was the most suitable. Now that this silk factory plan has been initiated, the main base of Chinese silk fabrics is in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and this place is just between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. So, I think my father will definitely approve of it, and the other shareholders will also be very willing." (146)</p>
