<h3>張伯倫再度發宣言　英國遠東政策無變更　表示極端重視英美合作可能性　兩國目標一致但方式不必茍同</h3>
<p>（倫敦）首相張伯倫今日在下院舉行外交辯論時發表言論、謂華北之反英暴動如長此繼續、該處英人權益之遭受攻擊、仍無遏止辦法、則英政府對之、將不得不採取極嚴重之意見、首相再度申明英政府將不因其他國家之請求而改變其遠東之政策、並說明東京方面所商定之英日方案、乃屬一種事實上之文告、並不含有政策之轉變、或承認日本有交戰國之權利、更非置英在在華利益於不顧、亦無讓渡第三方面任何權利之意嚮、首相述及美國最近之行動、謂渠信英美兩國之一般目的、實密切相似、惟兩國並無作同樣行動之必要、首相續稱、政府極端重視兩國可能之合作、渠將隨時以英國之行動及行將採取之計畫、通知美國云、（歡呼聲大作）</p>
<h3>辛克萊同情中國</h3>
<p>今日首先發言者、爲自由反對黨領袖辛克萊爵士、謂英國在中日戰事中、不能中立、因英國之同情、必須自然的趨向於中國也、辛氏又問最近英日妥協中所擬定之方案、是吾將妨害政府之援助中國、及政府是吾將拒絕交付現存天津之白銀、以免减弱中國抗戰之能力、並促政府速與各自治領會商、俾可儘早對於英日之商的有所行動、辛氏末稱、「切勿使英國失去與美國在遠東合作之又一機會」云、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>反對派工黨議負達爾頓、旋即猛烈抨擊政府、略謂以達東時局而論、政府支持中國法幣之所努力未可放棄、並須禁止各項原料品運往日本、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>張伯倫闡述政策</h3>
<p>首相乃起立答稱、僅知該方案各項表面上之解釋、殊不能明瞭其主旨、蓋此項解釋、足以引起中國之憂慮及痛苦、皆係對該方案未作縝密及公允之檢討者所造成、政府業已明白予以吾認矣、須知此項方案、乃爲一種事實上之文告、並不含有政策之轉變或承認日本之交戰國權利、更無置在華英國貿易於不顧、及讓渡第三國任何權利之意嚮、辛克萊爵士曾問及此項方案之意義、是否爲英國將援助日本保持其已得、並不妨礙其維護攫取、不知辛氏何以竟作此種怪異之言論、果如辛氏所言、豈非以良好之武器供給對吾人不壞好意之人乎、（歡呼聲作）此種言論不僅有害、且足以减弱吾人在世界之勢力、余今再度申明政府將不因他國請求、而改變共遠東之政策、余更欲聲明、日本亦並未要求吾人如此也、在目下進行之微妙談判中、前途自不免有許多困難之存在、其至顯者、即爲一般受日本鼓動及統治之人民、在華北方面作反英之暴動、余今有不得已於言者、如此種暴動長此繼續、而英人在華北之權益仍受攻擊如故、則英政府對之、將不得不採取極嚴重之意見、以上之事實、或將使設判極難獲得圓滿之結果云、首相又述及中國之白銀云、余對於此項性質之問題、必須與其他有同等利益之各國作充分之商討後、始能加以討論云、（路透電）</p>
<h3>艾登氏仗義執言</h3>
<p>前外用艾登、旣起發言、略謂、關於遠東時局、首相所作聲明、義正詞嚴、殊堪稱道、遠東時局茲有一點、極為顯明、即日本政府中國之計劃已吿失敗、中日戰爭、何日可以結束、此際殊南逆覩、蓋觀兩年之前、更覺遙遙無期也、溯自去歲秋季以還、中國士氣民心以及組織能力均已重行振作、在未淪陷之區域、匪特軍隊改編完成、且芷在重建工業、吾人欽佩之餘、自當熱烈予以稱道、日本因在軍事上未能獲致全勝、乃欲促中國幣制之崩潰、以達到勝利目標、其要求英國將天津租界內中國存銀交付日方、並承認日方所控制之銀行之紙幣、無非欲削弱中國法幣之地位、茲又設法誘令英國與之沆瀣一氣、英國若果照辦、不啻接受外國默書式之命令、而改變其政策、影響所及、吾國在中國曁在東方各屬所保有之利益、均將爲所妨害、自不可行、首相茲已堅決聲明、決不徇外國之請、改變對華政策、殊可欣幸、余並願政府再進一步明白表示、對於中國法幣、當賡續予以支持、則更善矣、時至此日、英日兩國關係、倘欲予以改善、當以日本在華中止鼓動反英活動爲其條件、吾則、英國不乏行動能力、此種行動方式如何、可於美國宣告廢止美日商的一事、窺見一斑、吾國政府倘能以此意昭告日本政府、全國與論、必能予以贊助、固毫無疑義也、（哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>密爾納擁護政府</h3>
<p>保守黨議員密爾納繼起發言、謂渠對首相極明白之言論、頗爲欣慰、並認爲非常滿意、旋又述及日本對於中國法幣所提出之要求、問首相能否作更進一步之表示、不但宣言英國將不支持日方之要求、且將設法妨碍其成爲事實、密氏又稱、渠以爲英國實無理由何以不仿做美國而廢止英日之商約、嗣又提及東京方案、謂日本如僅就其字面所包含者、而運用之、渠意此事、實屬英國外交上之勝利、惟目下之全部問題、乃爲妥協之結果如何、及是吾向英方有所要求、如日本要求英國支持其貨幣、則勢必引起極困難之局勢云、密氏續稱、吾人受條的及長期友誼之的束、而支持自由與獨立的中國之完整、英國應即採取任何手段、以促使日本退出因其領袖等之錯誤與狂妄所造成之不可能的地位、密氏末稱、英國雖具有充分之方法、如經濟或金融報復手段等、以迫使日本政府改變其對於英國利益之待遇、惟渠寗願以合作及友好之討論、以解决此項事件云、</p>
<h3>白特勒結束辯論</h3>
<p>外决白特勒結束辯論云、天津事件之談判、現仍在繼續進行中、關於警務方面之某某數點、業已商妥、現已呈報政府加以考慮、米來程序之一部份、將爲經濟及其他事件之考慮云、白氏又述及警務方面之各項事件云、政府現已決定依接受之方案、承認事實上之局勢、並允在限定區域之內及某種環境之下、對於某種每日之接觸、維持公正之態度云、白氏續稱、渠意此種承認日本佔據區域內事實局勢之態度、爲遠東英僑之利益及英國之政策計、實屬最智之政策、白氏末稱、英國對於華北之反英暴動、已向日政府提出强硬抗議云、</p>
<p>（倫敦）勞工反對黨擬於政府動議下院於八月四日作夏季休會時、再作一决外交辯論、彼等將特別注意遠東大局、（一日路透電）倫敦泰晤士報外交問題記者頃宣稱、「英國政府已將對華政策明白加以分析、再度予以聲明、卽張伯倫昨日在下議院所宣佈各點、亦已包括在內、甚或補充加以說明、統以之訓令駐華大使寇爾爵士、令其轉達中國政府、準此而論、則英國在華北努力應付事實問題之所爲、絕非對華政策有所變更之謂、換言之、卽非背棄中國之謂、反之英國政府仍當維持現行政策一如往昔」云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英報評論</h3>
<p>（倫敦）張伯倫首相之外交演說、頃由此間各報加以評論、「倫敦泰晤士報」載稱、「試將英國政府所推行之國際加以分析、其在遠束方面、主旨所在、厥爲中日兩國戰爭努力覓致公允的解決辦法、方針所在、乃欲保持一種立塲、俾克運用勢力、而以極有效的手段、完成此種任務」、「新聞紀事報」載稱、關於遠東局勢、張伯倫首相曾以鄭靈語調重行聲明、英日兩國之成立初步協定、絕非英國改變遠東政策之謂、此層大可令人安貼、關於英美兩國關係如何、外間頗有謠諑、張伯倫首相茲乃聲明英國政府所有舉動或擬有所舉動之意響、均皆隨時通知美國政府、此層亦爲一般人所樂聞、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日駐美大使　訪晤赫爾</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府自宣布廢止一九一一年美日商的後、駐美日大使掘內謙介昨日初决至國務院訪問國務鄉赫爾、兩人會談歷半小時方舉、以作和解美日兩國異見之努力（一日美聯）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國之外交政策</h3>
<p>『各方對於英日兩國初步協定所作不準確之解釋，足在中國引起焦念與苦悶，是宜加以貶斥』，此英國首相張伯倫氏於隔昨即七月卅一日在彼下議院宣述外交政策之際所鄭重聲明者也。自初步協定發表之後，日本與德義欣然，世論譁然，本報亦屢予檢討，頗事貶斥；是殆張伯倫氏所視爲解釋不準確所致，皆在受彼貶斥之列者歟？雖然，模稜曖昧，準確之解釋安在哉？片面唯諾，幾乎其將屈膝之神情可掬，則空談何足以釋焦念，甘言何足以釋苦悶，要惟待東京談判今後所表現之事實爲雄辯不爭之鐵證而已！目前差可告慰者，張伯倫氏能注意及於初步協定在中國所引起之反應而深有所不安，是則此人固猶足與語英國前途，遠東前途。</p>
<p>英國國會定於後日即八月四日休會，須閱兩月，至十月三日始再集會；張伯倫氏隔昨所宣述者，乃爲本屆會議中之最後表示，故其質量俱視平日爲重要。彼嘗於數日之前，聲明不願明白保證，在休會期內，英國外交政策絕不更張；此實政治家對國會負責，重然諾之徵，未可視爲張伯倫氏將利用國會休會兩月之機會而轉變其外交政策；申言之，隔昨之所宣述、應在原則上視爲英國外交政策在今後兩月內之軌範。若有轉變，事屬意外；顧以所述之嚴明曉暢，吾人既殷願其絕無意外，絕不轉變，更願紹介於讀者，其精讀本報本日新聞欄所紀，用爲今後兩月內觀察英國外交之參證。</p>
<p>張伯倫氏所宣述，要項凡四：一關遠東，二關英法蘇聯三國談判，三關但澤，四關英波貸款。關於遠束者，要點凡八：（一）不背棄英國在華利益，（二）不犧牲第三國權利，（三）不毀損英國之令譽並削弱在世界各處之勢力，（四）不徇他國之請而變更遠東政策，（五）確認排英運動爲日本所發縱指使，至少在華北方面若日本不事制止，將妨礙束京談判之成就，（六）天津存銀問題必與有關各國交換意見後始克有所決定，（七）英美對遠束目標相同，而舉動不必盡同，且或以不同其舉動之方式爲得計，（八）與美國宜合作且可能合作者，特予重視。凡此八點，或以爲無甚新提示；顧以吾人見解，竊願讀者特予注意者，即英美兩國間之情况，有其不可忽略之微妙在焉。按之九一八以來之過程，英美意態，輒相參商；除本年一月間之對日抗議，以及爾後之鼓浪嶼問題，儼然有兩國平行之觀；此外或剛或柔，或張或弛，幾乎使關心世變者啼笑皆非。不特如此而已，隱然與英美對立之各方面，對於英美兩國意態所作之解釋與批評，亦復正反紛紜，離奇龐雜；或於其平行，視爲偶合；或於其參商，視爲表裏；而於其動機，或視爲兩國協謀，對付日本，或視爲兩國齟齬，爭覇遠東。夫是是非非，究竟祇有一眞；前前後後，究竟祇有一理；顧乃解釋批評之者，雖同站於不滿英美之方面，而是非不同，前後不同，固何爲而然歟？是可說明國際問題，關係遠大，於是患得患失於其間者，各自爲謀而陷於前後是非之矛盾；亦可說明國際問題，內容複雜，於是挑撥離間於其間者，各就所私而輙試其慫恿破壞之伎倆。至於英美，張伯倫氏所謂兩國目標相同，固非欺人之談，毋庸寗謂爲兩國對於遠東政策之基調相同，允爲切當；徒以所視爲目標者，殊其遠近大小之觀感，殊其透達目標之內在條件，於是發爲言動者，殊其緩急重輕，初非有根本上之兩相乖違也。例如制止遠東侵略，兩國見解厥同；然能否制止，如何制止，何時制止，所辨不在於爲彼客觀對象之本體，而在於觀感與條件之不齊。、證以廢止商的，美國總統羅斯福氏潛移默運，及反對黨領袖作此建議，乃不待議院通過，毅然爲之；而英國昌言經濟制裁於天津租界被封鎖之始，及隔昨猶謂自治領之意見有待徵詢也。更證以所謂兩國合作，英國關鍵在於當局之猶疑，當局無所猶疑，惟期合作；美國關鍵在於輿情，有爲輿情所贊許之舉措，乃欲舉措之以獨往獨來之姿態，而不欲捐棄其孤立意識而合作舉措。張伯倫氏隔昨宣述之及於英美兩國者，洵能覷破其間微妙，此在英國爲嶄新之提示也。</p>
<p>在隔咋英國下議院之中，猶有値得連帶一言者：前外相艾登氏之演說，最饒政治與外交之意味，是應就英國國策及艾登氏地位，設身處地而體會之。艾登氏與辛克萊氏之積極建議，允可就彼保守與自由兩黨朝野之別而互爲發明。若惠爾遜其人者，既謂譴責日人而外。無可形容其所憎惡，顧又謂英國作爲未必能有益於遠束而主張袖手旁觀，以待他日投資；此則可以代表保守黨志行薄弱之分子，其人其言不足道，而輒使英國黯然灰色者，即其儔也。</p>
<h3>英財相表示　決維護中國法幣　不因東京協定變更初衷　英美法正積極商討辦法　三百萬鎊貸欵卽可成立</h3>
<p>（倫敦）下院本日午後開會時、反對派工黨以議員賈格曾詢問政府、是吾賡續維護中國法幣、西門財相當即答稱、「中國法幣之穩定、關於英國曁其他各國之在中國保有重要金剛商務利益者甚大、自宜予以維護、英國政府此種見解、不因英日兩國初步協定而有所變更、」工黨議員普萊斯繼起詢問、「日方現在中國淪陷區發行紙幣、企圖在金融上控制各該區、未知貴大臣能吾提供保證、决不予以特殊的援助、」西門財相又答稱、「余頃間所言、已甚詳盡、未見有可增益之處、至日木企圖在金融上控制中國淪陷區一層、乃係另一問題」云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關于英貸與三百萬鎊與中國之一事、聞海外貿易大臣赫特森與中國駐英大使郭泰祺、于本星期中或能成立協定、即付實施、（一日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）金融新聞政治訪員電稱、關於中國法幣之前途、英法美政府刻正活躍進行商議中、發動此等商議者爲英政府、蓋英政府被東京談判中日方所提貨幣耍求所迫而取此行動也云（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於金融新卵所戰、英。法。美三國政府對中國法幣前途、刻正作積極商榷之消息、路透社探悉、現有良好理由可信、法國已在原則上贊同、至於探助中國法幣之群則倘未討論、惟據一般人意見、援助法幣之將來計劃、需有極愼重之考慮、因平凖基金現行之手續、頗多弱點故也、金融家以爲如不同時對於中國鈔票之發行、予以嚴密之管理、則加於中國通貨之援助不能有效、此後平準基金之運用範圍、應僅以商業爲限、而不對中國紙幣出外匯、今日保守黨議員於路透訪員往見時、對於張伯倫昨在下院所發關於英政府遠東政策之言論、意見似不一致、其與苜相接近者、以爲政府在華北重要問題上、將堅不讓步、殊可使人滿意、惟其他議員、則願首相對於華北日幣與租界所存華人現銀等問話、發表更爲確切之答語、蓋彼等以爲在東京會議中、對於日本要求、予以明白之拒絕、乃不僅爲最痛快、且亦爲最賢明之途徑也、星期四日上院在辯論時、或將努力使政府發表對於此事之切實聲朋、（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）每日電間報外交訪員電稱、英政府刻正覓取美政府對遠東直接影響兩國利益的數項問題之意見、因美國近已宣佈廢止對日商約而表示其態度、英政府乃取此步驟、與英美均有關係之一項問題、乃爲日方冀英國支持華北日方卵翼下之貨幣而停止支持法幣、英政府似不致感覺有與日本獲得和平之意、縱英政府竞具此意、不得其他直接有關各國如法美等之許可、亦不能出此云、（一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>海關忙碌前所罕見　出口貨擁入山積　洋貨進口衰落景况暗淡　國府平衡貿易已收宏效　小機器轉輪內移</h3>
<p>字林報云、江海關人員昨（卅一日）極忙碌、爲多年來所罕遇、以結關單發給許多出口商、內多外商將貨物運往內地及海外、自侵晨起、至深夜止、外灘活動異常其情况卽在此商業繁盛的江濱亦屬鮮見、外灘自海關至戰爭紀念碑一帶、積有裝木箱或包裹之貨物數百噸、待裝入本週由滬出口之各貨輪、</p>
<p>出口商行</p>
<p>忙碌終日、將貨物運上數日內離埠之輪、如柯夫號、霞飛將軍號、及今日裝貨之柯立芝總統號等、據調查堆積沿江一帶之貨物多數運往英美等國、據海關人員聲稱、產物中雖頗多</p>
<p>彩色土布</p>
<p>然以食物佔大多數、而裝箱之鏡子等玻璃物品與火柴亦頗不少、並有小機器數架待運、將由沿海航輪載之南行、　入內地、據本埠外國出口商行某員語記者稱、該商行運貨出口</p>
<p>往外國者</p>
<p>從無昨日之忙碌、堆積整晨之貨物、至午後開始有减少之象、表示許多出口商已得結關單、而設法連貨登輪矣、同時、出口貨之多、使入口貨黯然失色、此猶爲數月來之第一决也、衆信此後數月中之</p>
<p>貿易趨勢</p>
<p>亦將如此、若干中國人士將昨日之出口繁盛歸功於中政府平衡國際貿易、减少入口、以適應戰時情况之努力、里慶並厲行禁止上海「仇貨」多種輸入內地、惟本埠商人則堅稱上海之出口商行利用匯價低落、廉價辦貨、運往外國、日前法幣價値改低、則入口减少、自不足奇、豫料將來入口、甚至更將衰落、</p>

<p>者、故鐵絲網之內圍、雖亦有日兵守衛、惟進出居民、則母須作尺蠖之曲、且毌須通行證、惟日方顯以近數日中、爲被封鎖商店及住戶之猶豫期、即去留任擇其一、去者</p>
<p>聽其遷徒</p>
<p>留者則先須向海奪路北江西路東段、即新被封鎖區域內街頭防疫處、注射防疫針、然後再憑防疫證領取通行證、如此則始取得居住資格、惟就大通社記者觀察所及、願居留該新被封鎖區內、顯然甚少、因該路滿停搬塲車輛、店舖則</p>
<p>紛以售品</p>
<p>及雜俱、住家則紛以家具及箱籠、向租界中區搬遷殊有避之若浼之勢、即足以證明之、惟就昨晨所見情形、有堪注意之一點、厥爲沿鐵絲網攔架處之日兵、已大見减少、缺口處之內衛、雖仍由日兵站崗、外衛則改由華捕駐守、故緊張空氣、已寬弛不少矣、</p>

<p>神光駛溫業已折回英商怡隆公司所屬輪船行駛航綫、向爲溫州興化泉州沙埕福州等綫、自浙閩沿海各口岸爲日艦封鎖之後、被迫暫行拋錨停航、日前曾派神光輪由滬空船試航溫州、及至溫州之口外、因日艦已放置水雷於甌江口外、以致無法駛入、折回上海、昨據滬公司消息、該輪約三日可抵滬、所以溫州之復航、短期內難實現、</p>
<p>寗海抵港　沙埕停航</p>
<p>福建沙埕航綫、自日艦阻撓行駛後、英商禮和洋行之海福輪、駛抵沙埕口外被阻卸貨、因此開航上海沙埕計劃中止進行、英商太古公司寗海輪、由沙埕駛香港、外傳在閩洋面爲日艦扣留、今已證實該輪在沙埕香港途中、會受日艦用旗號盤問、但並未檢查扣留、現已安抵香港、目前太古怡和等公司、並無船隻行駛沙埕、</p>
<p>江蘇試灣　興化泉州</p>
<p>江蘇試灣興化泉州英商各輪船公司爲維持因日艦之封鎖中國沿海航錢而停航、如汕頭口岸、雖遭日方一再阻撓、而南洋班各輪、照常兼灣、今太古公司已派定江蘇輪定四日由滬駛港、决兼灣興化泉州、聞此决兼灣係試灣性質、故有無問題、尚難預料、公司方面對於客貨、决用駁船駁入碼頭、</p>
<h3>昨日午後　浦江高潮</h3>
<p>太平洋新颶風、於昨日午後二時、已進抵北緯二六度、東經一百三十六度之一百二十海哩範圍以內、查上報方位、在琉球羣島與日屬父島之中間、風向東北東、故上海可無被襲之虞、又據天文台昨日午後二時報告、太平洋琉球島南部、又有一新颶風勃起、所抵方位、爲北緯二十四度、東經一百二十七度之六十海哩範圍以內、因呈靜止狀態、故其趨向未明、惟此颶風其風力甚爲猛烈、且查日本沿海與江浙沿海、氣壓均趨同樣低落、故其趨向與發展、甚堪重視、至本埠氣候、昨日頗呈炎熱、午後三時前之最高氣溫、據天文台紀錄、達九十一度半、最低氣溫、爲七十六度八、天氣則終日晴明、叉浦江昨日午後二時間、發潮頗高、低窪路面、陰溝有潮水冒出、今日仍有高潮、須五日起、可平復、</p>
<h3>秋繭問題未解決　絲廠前途悲觀　拋出期絲商定延期解貨　廠商受日阻撓損失不貲</h3>
<p>租界內各絲廠、前因原料告罄、被迫停工、本擬俟春繭上市後、即行開工、旋因各廠向淪陷區域收得之繭、爲「華中蠶絲公司」非法阻撓、以致延不恢復開工、今春繭運滬問題、已告解決、租界區四十餘家、如連元。福隆。越興。華綸。上海。鴻豐等廠、均已先後恢復開工繅絲、惟因春繭運滬被阻之損失、爲數不貲、</p>
<p>拋售期絲　延期解貨</p>
<p>各廠雖已恢復開工、但原料不多、預料十月之後、恐又因原料告罄而停工、關於收買欽繭問題、迄未解決、所以絲廠前途、頗爲悲觀、至於各廠以前拋出之春繭上市後期絲、業經各廠與經營出口之洋行、商妥延期解貨、在秋繭問題未解決以前、暫行停止再行拋售期絲、叉浙東春繭之運滬、迄未成事實、</p>
<p>出口激增　絲價略漲</p>
<p>今年上半年度出口之華絲、（一）白絲一六七·八二七公斤、値一百四十五萬七千元、（二）白絲經二六八·二八五公斤、値三百四十六萬一千元、（三）白廠絲九三七·二六九公斤、値二千零五十四萬七千元、（四）黃廠絲。黃絲經三一五·〇七四公斤、値二百五十七萬六千元、（五）廢絲一·一七八·八七四公斤、値二百五十九萬六千元、（六）灰絲同宮絲等、一二六·三二五公斤、値一百萬元、華絲出口、比較去年已激增、價格每擔高至三千二百元、</p>
<h3>節省孟蘭勝會費用　救濟難民　金宗城氏建議</h3>
<p>新新公司董事長金宗城氏、以廢曆七月將屆、俗有盂蘭勝會之舉、浪費金錢、爲數甚鉅、與其擲諸虛牝、不若提出救濟難民、其意至爲切要、金氏昨語往訪者云、現在上海地方、有兩個重要的問題、一個是物價的在漲、生活愈覺艱困、一個是在炎夏的天氣、疾病的增多、對於這兩個問題、最感到痛苦的、就要算街頭露宿</p>
<p>窮無所歸</p>
<p>的難民、自戰事發生以後、被戰事避迫而流落爲難民的、不知其恒河沙數、其所遭受的流離顚沛無衣無食的苦楚、可算是人世間最悲慘的一件事、就上海一埠而言、難民人數、達數十萬、其中一部份有收容所暫時收容、予以給養、總算勉强解決了衣食病痛的問題、但是一般露宿街頭窮無所歸者、自市面上輔幣缺乏後、向來靠求乞以圖一飽的、乞錢大難、現在還要受到物價飛漲炎夏疾病的痛苦、更覺陷在</p>
<p>水深火熱</p>
<p>之中、人類有天賦的同情心、見到這種難民的苦况、大家必然要發生惻隱之心、因想陰歷的七月、江近到來、上海的市民、向來有一種習慣、發起孟蘭勝會、賑濟陰世的鬼魂、這也可算是一椿慈善事業、一個月的所費、着實大有可觀、不過賑濟陰世鬼魂、是見不到的、賑濟這般難民、是親眼所看見的、在現在的時候、當然先要顧到眼見的事情、救生的人民、當然</p>
<p>比較救死</p>
<p>的爲重要、俗語云、「一錢不落虛空地」、一樣是救濟、一樣是陰功積德、倘使救濟難民、那就所謂「巷上天好生之德」、這種功德就更大了、所望上海慈善的市民們多多的注意、救人即所以救己、大家快把盂蘭勝會的費用、救濟救濟難民罷、</p>

<h3>海誓山盟的戀愛　何故會曇花一現？</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞大醫科畢業楊南醫師</p>
<p>理智不能充分發達，專馳曇於空想，動於感情，誤其靑年男女之前途者，要不得不推自由戀愛主義。吾人對於戀愛爲結婚之一要素說，固無異議。然以結婚爲不可不以戀愛爲成立之要件，則認爲偏見。彼於結婚之後而始創造愛情者，決不稀少。反是，甚有許多靑年，於戀愛熱度過高之時，不顧一切，海誓山盟，會幾何時，即仇如水火，各不相容，其愛情竟如曇花之一現，此究屬何故？一言以蔽之，此完全由於性機能渙散，不克負担艱難之生殖工作所致。因爲男女之愛，其中產自精神上之融合者不過十分之三，而來自肉慾者，佔其十分之七。故男女若無性生活爲之媒介，決不能全始全終，彼之以戀愛是尚之靑年，米講戀愛之前，常喜自凟，其性機能受自凟之斵傷，一旦進入眞正之結婚生活，反難振作，其愛情史必如曇花之一現，失戀難免。舊式婚姻祗憑媒妁之言，父母之命而結婚，婚後愛情圓滿者甚多，此蓋由於生殖力爲之安定其基礎故也。故與其以易於變動不定之戀愛爲結婚要件，毌寗以健康之精力，强堅之生殖力爲結婚上要件，苟能以是爲準，則夫婦之愛可得永久維持，然上述之條件，每個男子應求必具。在婚前萬勿荒淫，自凟允宜戒絕，有遺精者速即就治自覺腎虧者，，勿作不合理之治療，據余多年來治療本症之經騐所得，施用德國眞正睪丸內分泌劑男用「補體康」能充分增强其生殖機能，促進新陳代謝力，治未老先衰遺精滑精，如風掃落葉，有藥到病除之妙。彼房事過度，自凟等之濫耗精液，致使睪丸所製造之內分泌液，供不應求，不但造成陰痿，抑且血液中缺少此類分泌液，則影嚮身體之健康甚大，故用睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以洽上述各症，皆有特殊之功。</p>
<p>現代醫學</p>
<h3>記憶力之增進法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>凡是立非常事業的人，必具非常之腦力。蓋凡頭腦敏捷，記憶力强者，恒能占人上風，如莘莘學子，與持籌握算之商業家，其成績與勝算，自可高人一等。然此非一般人常得此天賦，故成功者屬於少數，此過去之舊觀念也。今因科學進步，始解釋此種啞謎，從前人認爲少數人所天賦的，現可以用人力爲之改造。蓋腦中之記憶力，平均都在水平線以上，而大多降至水平線以下者，多於發育時期，濫施手淫，或早婚縱慾，致靑春腺之發育，受到莫大之障礙。而記憶力亦日見薄弱。往往於昨日所做之事，形同隔世，而誦讀之書，亦因記憶力之薄弱，雖終日佔嗶，亦不能背誦。於是精神益感苦悶，事業益無成就。悵悵人生，益無生趣，恒有厭世自殺的。</p>
<p>然現在巳經有科學的方法可以解決人生最大之缺恨。凡患有記憶力不佳，記銘力缺乏，判斷力欠精之患者，槪可服用德國梅倫博士所發明之「補體康」，蓋「補饅康」一藥，能助長靑春腺之發育，增加腦中記憶的細胞力。並使肌肉細膩白晰，而有彈性。蓋記憶力强大，肌肉豐實，惟靑春時代始有之，而一般靑年因發育時代，手淫與房事之過度，結果如初出嫩芽，被在風暴雨所摧殘，自然要萎黃枯落，所以息有未老先衰之象。可是如用「補體康」服用之後，有如久旱而逢甘露，黍谷回春，不僅記憶力爲之增加，並能重返靑春活潑之神態。如用功讀書之學子，持籌握算之商業家，因而記憶力不佳者，服「補體康」神效無比。</p>
<h3>痰多防肺癆</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>痰多之人，呼吸必感不便，舉動氣急，痰唾稠粘，或白或黃，或稀或濃，晨起允多黑塊，咳嗽時期，恒易透發肺炎，是不可不亟行治療而謀補救也，考肺部健全之人，其痰必少，而患肺病者，其痰必多，以醫學之原則而言，掃除咳嗽多痰，以補肺部爲前提—而「補肺拿爾」一藥，確爲鎭咳祛痰之特效製劑，其功效凌駕魚肝油之上，且服「補肺拿爾」之後，未成癆者可預防肺癆，已成癆者服之能使一二三期之肺病澈底根治，如咯血盜汗。氣喘等症均所對症，宜世界各大醫院及專家，皆以此藥爲肺病特效藥也。</p>
<h3>遺精治愈例　戀愛不遂促成夢遺</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>患者董友林，福建厦門人，年二十二　·（自訴）。去春與一女友發生戀愛，後因家長意見不合，致不能如願，此後每於睡中朦朧之時，一切幻象，盡量湧現，而成夢遺，漸决增加，乃來余處治療（治愈經過）。乃令其攝生，從事高尚娛樂，睡前以冷水摩擦局部，並服「耐而斯遺精片」三片，董君遵余言而行，二個月後，已無事遺發生。</p>
<h3>早年斲傷婚後陰痿</h3>
<p>患者史維康，浙江紹興人，年二十五歲，（自訴）。早年喜閱淫書，又受同伴引誘，常以手玩弄性器，使出精爲樂，後常有遺精，不甚注意，念三歲時結婚，對房事竟不能持久，止長半分鐘，而性器短小如兒，爲幸福計特此求治云云。（治愈經過）每日電療，服「耐而斯遺精片」鞏固其精關，再兼服「補體康」治其早洩陰痰，略治三月而愈。</p>
<p>淋病瑣談</p>
<h3>淋毒關節炎之痛楚</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口　　淋毒而至關節炎，本爲其人已失去速愈之機會，而轉變爲淋毒性全身傳染之一。蓋其成因雖多，而歸根結底言之，不外淋病患者，遷延失治，餘毒內攻，復因飲酒與房事等之刺㦸，此狡猾淋菌，隨血液之循環，傳播全身，若淋菌稽留關節，即成爲關節炎，患者寒熱交作，關節腫大，突然劇痛，呈緊張與波動的狀態，倦怠，食慾不振，其淋菌範圍，至此日益擴大，故幻變莫測，更非一般局部手術，及透膜殺菌等劑所可奏功。</p>
<p>蓋全身關節，既多有此等淋菌盤據作祟，勢不能作一枝一節之驅除，而必須統籌全局，作根本之解决，故自非予以全身細胞起抗淋噬菌之作用不可。蓋病毒既如此彌漫全身，何能用局部之手術療法，以求奏效？如今已有科學方法可以解决此事。即在理學療法上用德國X線電療，及静電療法交互爲用，一方又用德國抗淋血淸，及內服淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，立能消炎鎭痛退腫。因服「克淋儂」後於短期內即發生抗淋噬菌作用，一方助以抗淋血淸，與静電X電療，更能發揮「克淋儂」殺菌之特殊偉效。故匿藏關節深部之淋菌，全部肅淸，一方又獲消炎鎭痛防腐之效。故關節腫痛，如內部未化膿者，服「克淋儂」可以保險防止而消滅之。並恢復原狀　診時…上午十時至下午六時自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並贈價值一元之「性病全書」一册</p>

<h3>工部警備委員會討論　管理交通問題　自行車違章疾駛加緊取締　汽車行駛過速當控究車夫</h3>
<p>工部局警備委員會上月二十日開會時、曾討論關於交通事項之議案多起、當有中國汽車偕行社提出之意見書、供各委員參考、並由西僑李德爾列席發表意見、李氏在上屆納稅外僑年會時、即有關於管理交通事項之演辭一篇、其摘要亦經各委員批閱、茲分誌討論結果如下、</p>
<p>取締自行　車之違章</p>
<p>中國汽車偕行社曾調街道上之自行車、常有認意急馳情事、危險滋多、亟宜從嚴取締、關於此事、警備委員會各委昌現已知悉該局警務處業經採取嚴厲措置、被控訴之騎自行車人、平均每月有五二七名、警務處並將警告文字及關於行路宜求安全之宣傳品、陸續分送各自行車乘騎者及自行車行、當時會中有人主張對於不守規則或不服指揮之騎自行車人、不妨從嚴處辦、例如拘押等等、惟警務處長以爲實行拘押一層、似屬不宜、現在捕房對於若輩所採取締辦法、乃撬除執照、事後由車主向法院繳納罰款　回、捕房如加緊實行、則此法較爲相宜、該處長又謂自行車爲常用之交通工具、將來違章情事、勢必日漸增多、各委員當即議決、擬請局方訓令警務處對於違犯交通章程及不守巡捕指揮之騎自行車人、加緊取締、</p>
<p>海格路停　車處問題</p>
<p>中國汽車偕行社又稱、海格路南面鄰近大禮拜堂西童女校及德國總會一帶、應禁止停放汽車、以期减少危險、警務處謂此事應由法公董局警務處考量之、該社所擬一節、業經轉達核辦、</p>
<p>取締汽車　速率過度</p>
<p>租界內之熱鬧地段如愛多亞路福煦路一帶、常有卡車及出租汽車開駛過速、允以空車爲甚、中國汽車偕行社認爲有特別危險性之速率過度情事、應予取締、並建議由機器脚踏車巡邏隊加以特別注意、據警務處長報告稱、該處已飭令巡邏警員對於此事、加緊監視、結果上月間被控究之開車人共有一二七名云云、各委員表示警務處之巡邏及其控訴、當可見效、</p>
<p>汽車超越　前車問題</p>
<p>中國汽車偕行社又提出意見一項、謂愛多亞路常有汽車超越朝同一方向進行或等候交通指揮燈信號之其他車輛、允以中午熱鬧時間爲最、近來該處載重貨車日多、因此車輛進行殊爲遲緩、馬力較低之汽車、無法超越貨車、以致車輛更見阻塞、結果速度較高之汽車、在向前開行之時、往往不顧現行交通章程、超越前行車輛、並希圖穿過緩行之貨車、爲補救起見、擬請工部局在愛多亞路路面劃出白色界綫兩條、重載貨車、僅許行於左面之界綫內、以便速行車輛在兩綫之間、超越前車、此項辦法、對於開車人可發生一種心理上之影響、歐美各國、早經採用云云、警務處方面以爲愛多亞路車行道之寬度不足、超越前車情事、易生危險、且有干禁例、上述之建議、足以鼓勵開車人違章駕駛、且與迎面開來之車輛、易於碰撞、駐守於愛多亞路之警員、現已奉命注意於越車情事、各委員會對於警務處所稱各節、表示同意、會中又有人主張愛多亞路兩邊虛耗地位過多、工部局主管各處應設法將路面上所有站台移近側石、以便寬放速行車輛可用之路面、工部局工務處繼稱所有站台、倘能全部移去、固可使交通方面、大見改進、惟裝置站台之用意、一則在劃分緩行與速行車輛、二則在使車輛可於兩站台之間停放、設將速行車輛所用路面拓寬、則所餘地位、是吾仍敷停放車輛及駕駛緩行車輛之用、頗有疑問、且行經愛多亞路之塌車頗多、允須注意、關於愛多亞路路政之任何變更、必須獲得法公董局之同意云云、</p>
<p>改良跑馬　廳路路面</p>
<p>跑馬廳路兩邊路面、稍現粗劣不平之處、因此大多數塌車老虎車人力車及自行車等、均行駛於此路之中心部份、中國汽車偕行社認爲此類狀態、與拓寬跑馬廳路之用意相背、應予改良、並建議在此路路面亦劃出交通界綫三條、關於此事、警務處已提出報告、內稱、跑馬廳路及其他各馬路限制緩行車輛之辦法、業經施行、路面之崎嶇不平問題、已請工務處予以注意、跑馬廳路兩邊路面、允爲不平、易生危險、故所有車輛、一概不准超越前車、工務處長曾稱、築造跑馬廳路之時、因材料缺乏、且欲力求節省、兩邊路面、係用舊料築成、故不能與該路中央部份同樣平坦、惟不久將有無軌電車、在此路行駛、屆時兩邊路面、當有翻造之必耍、</p>
<p>提倡塌車　裝橡皮輪</p>
<p>中國汽車偕行社又擬請兩租界當道通告所有塌車老虎車應一律改裝橡皮胎輪、並規定自某日（假定明年一月一日）起、凡鐵輪塌車等一槪不許領照、警務處長報告稱、鐵輪塌車等改裝橡皮輪一事、已在進行中、各委員又據報告稱、工部局鑒於鐵輪塌車等易於損壞路面、曾於已往數年間、再三討論改裝橡皮輪問題、並經議決爲鼓勵車主起見、凡已改裝橡皮輪之場車等、准自一九三七年七月一日起、豁免執照費之半數、工部局董事會通過此項議案時、曾明白表示局方對於塌車等改裝車輪一事、不願採取强制辦法、上年十二月間、工部局爲進一步鼓勵起見、會改訂塌車等之執照費表、准許已裝橡皮輪之此等車輛、所載貨物重於同等級之未裝橡皮輪者、自本年七月一日起實行、關於此事、警備委員會仍主張不採取强制措置、（第一節完）</p>

<h3>敎部高敎司科長陳東原談　如何選擇院系及學校）（續二）　學校招牌不足證明內容好壞　選擇院系有幾方面應當注意</h3>
<p>（四）學校招牌的原則、以上所講、是選擇院系的原則、現在談到選擇學校、通常人都以學校招牌好壞爲選擇學校的標凖、這也是很有理由的、人人都說好的學校、一定有他的原因、或者是敎師好、設備好、學風好、已經畢業的學生、在社會上的出路好、這都是應當重視的條件、不過所謂學校的好壞、普通也極容易有一種不正確的看法、譬如、那學校規模大、學生多、經費多、建築好、所在地好、常有要人去演講、校長會活動、學校會對外宣傳、社會上儘有許多人是因爲這些條件而讚美那個學校、尊重那個學校的、不用說、這些條件、絕不能做一個學校好壞的正確標凖、規模大的學校、斷不就是好的學校、經費多的學校、更不能就是好的學校、大的學校、往往有很不好的敎授、錢多的學校、往往浪費無益、相反地說、小的大學裏也會有很好的敎師、錢少的學校、也容易裴現出優良的成績、不僅說中國的大學同中國的大學比是如此、就是中國的大學同外國的大學比、外國的大學、也儘有拆爛汚的敎授、遠比不上中國大學內之優良敎授的、當然、規模大經費多的學校、容易辦得好、但是其能吾辦的好、便要看他的校長爲何許人，院長爲何許人、所請的敎授是不是第一流了，</p>

<h3>金融　英對華政策不變　外滙轉賣驟濃厚</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、初開銀行賣意殊淡、計英金再縮一二五、美又軟二五、開後突聞路透社消息、張伯倫態度强硬、對華政策決不改弦易轍、兼又聲明關於日方要求天津租界內中國所存之四千八百萬白銀、已向美法二國商議辦法應付、是以法幣前途更形樂觀、故外行賣意驟濃、港方亦曾來電拋塞、加以日行頻售現期英美兩滙、致市勢逐漸回平、結果英平、美反硬〇三二五、據聞現貨與本月底掉期、西商沙遜想貼進美金六二五、（合月息八分左右）、但外行如大通某行祗肯貼出美金半元、的合月息六分三厘光景、故掉期鮮聞做開、全天交易尚旺、</p>
<p>開盤稍見緊縮</p>
<p>晨初以倫教大條、近期續長〇六二五、遠期又昂一二五、紐的銀價呆定、倫教生金仍平、滙兌英對美勿動、對滬小〇六二五五、對法未更、美對英·對滬·對法均無變化、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士二五、美滙八元二五、較前收英緊一二五、美軟二五、突聞東京英日談判、張伯倫態度强硬、致外行等賣意陡濃、是以市勢頓見回硬、首由某英行售予洋行現貨英金四辨士三一二五、繼而某行賣予孟買銀公司現貨美滙八元三一二五及三七五、後又塞予同行華比荷蘭現貨美滙八元四三七五、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉悉無變動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、依然免微、此後港電塞予外行現貨美滙八元五三一二五、時日行正金亦售予華比有利現貨英金四辦士三七五、現貨美滙八元五六二五、致過程頗形鬆硬、將近午刻、因洋行界趁賤扒吸、於是爲狀趨平、計洋行結進外行現貨美滙八元半及四三七五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士三四三七五、美滙八元四三七五、較晨開英回鬆〇九三七五、美亦回硬一八七五、</p>
<p>日行亦來塞出</p>
<p>後市日行續來塞予外行現貨英金四辦士四〇六二五、並現貨美滙八元五三一二五及五六二五、此後日行又吐予港電外行本月份英金四辦士　、兼又賣予外行本月份美滙七元八一二五、是以爲狀穩中帶硬、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士三七五、美滙八元五三一二五、本月份英金四辦士、美滙七元七八一二五、結果比上日現貨英平、美硬〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港申匯續升</p>

<p>天津滙市平穩</p>
<p>天津一日電、今日滙市、開盤堅穩、對英對美不動、申滙降三元、爲一百二十七元、「聯鈔」暗盤回昻二元、爲一百〇二元、</p>
<h3>金市起伏</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、因外匯仍稍有曲折、致市勢亦起落不定、大致先漲繼跌、而後盤旋、初時因外匯晨開猛縮、故同業多頭心思頓濃、紛紛互相放盤抬價、允以某錢兌業與證券帮搜羅愈力、致晨開遂昻達三千六百九十元、繼又漲至三千穴百九十五元高峯、嗣因聞路透社電訊、張伯倫在下議院聲明、決不變更對華政策、逐步回硬、致人心爲之一轉、某金號代投機商賣意更殷、且浮多了結、亦紛至沓來、致市勢傾疲、一度回挫至三千六百十元低盤、入後因某銀樓（代港方）及證券帮趁低又來吸收、市象漸平、盤旋於三千六百四五十元之間、結果以三千六百四十元收盤、較上日僅軋跌三元、交易尚旺、的八九百兩、銀樓飾金結果無榮辱、海關金與中英純金等仍乏變化、</p>
<h3>烚赤暗市多曲折</h3>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞外匯晨開英金祇四便士二五、美滙僅八元二五、故同業心思頓形向榮、一時大宗爭先恐後、互相放盤羅購、致漲風頗熾、開市竟在抬四十七元、某錢兌業進某金號三十兩、及現金號二十兩、價爲三千六百九十元、嗣叉漲五元、證券帮進某金號四十兩、價三千六百九十五元爲當日高峯、時忽聞外匯因外行賣意陡濃、市勢轉硬、故進者觀望、一刹那竟回落四十五元、錢兌業賣予某銀樓五十兩、價三千六百五十元、後證券帮又來吸收、一度高昂、證券帮進錢兌業五十兩、價三千六百六十五元、此後雖某銀樓與某錢兌業及證券帮等互相吸購、無如外匯逐步報硬、且某金號代投機商續來出籠、市勢轉趨下游、不久竟傾瀉五十五元、現金號賣予某銀號十兩、價三千六百十元、爲當日低盤、十一時半後、聞外匯止鬆略軟、故買方進意轉濃、價頓回上、某銀樓進某金號四十兩、價三千六百三十五元、繼而證券帮進錢兌業十兩、價三千六百五十元、後銀樓帮塞予某銀號十兩、價叉回低至三千六百三十五元、將近午刻、某錢兌業進同業五十兩、三千六百四十五元爲午收價、午後開市做高十元、錢兌業互做二十兩、價三千六百五十五元、開後某金號與錢兌業頻來塞出、市象轉疲、未幾即做小十五元、錢兌業售予證券帮三十兩、價三千六百四十元、後錢兌業進銀樓帮三十兩、價三千六百四十二元、繼而金號互做二十兩、價三千六百四十五元、三時二十分錢兌業互做五十兩、三千六百四十元爲晚收價、結果比上日軋跌三元、聞收後三千六百四十五元有成交、全天八十五元上落、現金號之本牌金照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢鮮有做開、</p>
<h3>飾金結果無榮辱</h3>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百七十元、迨至九時三十分掛高五元、逾刻許後忽掛小十元、十二時〇三分回上五元、此後未聞變化、結果無上落、計大同行仍懸三百七十元、新同行爲三百六十八元、收進的减十餘元不等、</p>
<h3>中英純金仍不變</h3>
<p>三十一日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯仍屬七鎊八先令六便士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價仍呆定於一千二百十二元六角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標凖標金價亦仍爲一千百〇七〇九角、</p>
<h3>美金鎊升三元　英金票需要亦旺</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊、因烚赤開盤高漲、市况回升、雖烚赤晚收疲弱、但因供給稀少、市况仍堅、英金蔡需要殷、市上缺乏、價乃續升、美金票因外滙鬆動、供給頗暢、市况微見下降、香港票法郞票安南票、因赴西南者衆、需要旺而市價較昂、日金票市價日跌、晚市為一元零五分、朝鮮票供給稀少、市况稍堅、晚市爲八角八分、公會交易未做開昨日市價、英余鎊升一元、英金票升三角、美金鎊升一、美金票降二角五分、香港票升二分、法郞票升一厘、安南票升五分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>現鈔需求減　貼現狂跌</h3>
<p>—六十元—</p>
<p>昨日匯劃票據貼現率、在跌益烈、每千元之貼率、已破入二百元大關內、蓋中國金融已見穩定、爭扒外匯、傾購黃金等風潮已息、需求現鈔者大减所致、昨上午初仍二百二十元光景、旋以現鈔供者蜂湧、致步退二十元、午刻爲二百元、下午破入二百元內後、更不支直瀉、最后竟低位一百六十元、較之前日最後價在跌六十元、錢業公會、拆息仍未更、早午兩市均掛二角、</p>
<h3>郵票代分幣　每元百廿分</h3>
<p>自零找通用郵票以來，一經汚損，便失效用，市民希望分幣券，「頭頸望得絲瓜長」，可是報紙不斷宣傳，何日可到，何時可用，「但聞樓梯響，不見人下來」，亦可謂極盡宣傳矣，因之分數交易，只得仍用郵票，店家收存之郵票，不能盡數找出，乃有整票出賣之一法，現售每元可換一百十分乃至一百二十分，而拒收者亦比比皆是。</p>
<h3>市上增加現鈔　九百萬元</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業公會、因財部馬電公佈、爲調劑同業資金、藉以支付五百元以下之法幣存款起見、商得中中交三行統一、將同業於六月底止結存銀錢會庫之滙劃存款總額二千二百萬元、按九五折成法幣、分十二星期平均支取、委託銀行準備會辦理、自七月四日起開始支付、計七月四日爲第一期、十一日爲第二期、十八日爲第三期、二十五日爲第四期、昨日（八月一日）爲第五期支付之期、銀錢業昨日均向準備會辦理支付手續、有支取現鈔者、亦有轉入該會國幣往來戶者、共計同業增加一百八十萬元之法幣籌碼、若五期合計、則銀錢同業已增法幣九百萬元之流通籌碼、連日貼現暴落、與此當亦不無影響、至於第六期將於八日（下星期二）支付、（鷹）</p>
<h3>大條續長</h3>
<p>三十一日倫敦電、銀市印度買進、及有人補空、但美商買出、市面尚半、收盤後仍平、進者知足、大條銀、近期續長〇六二五、遠期父昻一二五、紐約銀電、美現貨呆定如故、叉孟買銀電、印銀市况穩靜、現貨漲二安那、期貨均升三安那、成交單共計百張云</p>
<h3>證劵　內債關鍵　緊於時局</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、買賣均除第七期息票計算、開價與隔日連息價相差二元一二角、市價可稱堅定、而其走勢之高低相差額、範圍已小、祇二三角之升沉、自六月十九日至今、利息問題、鬧得滿城風雨、至此可謂告一段落、第七决本息今可得一結論、政府方面實際業已停止付給、由中中交三行竭力暫爲墊付滙劃票據、以資維持、第八决本息如何辦理、乃另一問題、故此决不得謂之定例、環境方面、中日英日以及歐洲問題均漸趨嚴重化、僞鈔推行愈烈、英日問題已屆最後關頭、歐洲事件錯綜複雜、已有劍拔弩張之象、風雲瀰漫、陰雜四合、公債市價乃亦隨之波動不已、前以本息問題爲關鍵者、今將視時局爲轉移矣、昨日交易已驟形岑寂、買賣均毫不踴躍、賣方爲天生松茂及富春、買方爲聯益鴻康及卅一號、進出頗爲閑散、大都爲搶帽子交易爲多、故其成交數祇二十餘萬元而已、各債均係除息、新做開之漲跌暫不列表、茲將其高低及收盤價列表於後、倫敦外債、行市無變動、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股四十股、價爲五元三角衆業公所報告、雖紐的橡皮原料價格上漲、及本埠外滙市面呈平靜情形、昨日本所交易甚爲淸淡、實業股與橡皮股、均無甚變動、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東公司股票行市上月三十一日（週一）掛牌行市、滙豐銀行股、已减掛除息後新價、倫敦註冊股爲七十五鎊、香港註冊股爲七十七鎊、麥加利銀行升五先令、價爲六鎊十七先令六便士、煤礦股上星期五電報錯誤、開平煤礦股價應爲十五先令六便士、朝鮮煤礦股不動、價爲四先令九便士、古拉客林傍橡皮股升六便士、價爲十八先令、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　紛起囤藏　棉紗大漲特漲　特金城創六七五元空前價　冷門貨昨亦漲二十元之鉅</h3>
<p>紗市續升、且漲風特現狂驟、蓋以市上流言　起、人心趨挺、故外匯黃金市况雖在水平綫上、然投機商對於棉紗搜羅囤藏之念、又見死灰復燃、一時買者猶似蜂擁而來、市盤乃勇往直前、二十支雙馬牧盤價已高至五百八十八元、比昔日之頂高峯價僅低七元、惟二十支特金城漲風可畏、連漲三日、計五十五元、收盤價爲六百七十五元、發現紗業有史以來新紀錄、價格雖暴漲如此地步、然囤不不但將存紗不出、反見繼續收進深藏也、</p>
<p>現紗情形晨初開盤、人氣極烈、市塲呌喊者大都買進、一時又現驚愕之狀、同時造謠者紛紛、買勢愈趨愈緊、盤子越做越高、二十支變馬外棧現貨便開盤爲五百七十一元、棧單價爲五百五十五元、須臾間乃步步飛騰、至雙馬現貨收盤價爲五百八十八元、棧單價爲五百七十二元、查半日各帮買去統計一千三百八十包、又上日午後成交二百十包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十二元、特金城漲二十五元、牧羊漲十三元半、冷門貨亦漲二十元、今日有棉紗二十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>香港　四一〇　內地　一七五</p>
<p>同行　七三五　天津　五〇</p>
<p>統計　一、三八〇</p>
<p>日紗市面亦飛漲、查其原因、大有莫明其妙、二十支月琴紗本月份價爲四百六十元外云、</p>
<p>另一報告云、棉紗市塲上、對於同一支數、同一等級的紗廠出品棉紗、除了冷門貨的新脾紗不去說外、單就同樣熱銷的老牌紗來說、價格抬高和別低、竟會相差得天高地遠、例如申二二十支天女紗、和申九二十支雙馬紗、論品質天女紗條幹。色澤。拉力等、並不决於雙馬紗、何以天女紗總比雙馬紗要別低十七八元或二十五六元呢、這使局外人如入五里霧中、何况天女牌賣價曾一度高過雙馬牌呢、這內幕實在有一說的必要、</p>
<p>據業中人談「雙馬」價的高於「天女」、因廠方對於客帮的感情聯絡濃厚、有時客帮爲欲凑船期之故、請廠方多派出品或將派貨提前、廠方能應主顧之請、於無可設法之中設法、予客帮以種種通融及便利、吾則裝貨船期一說、來回需時甚久、影響於銷路及價格方面至巨、主顧旣獲廠方便利、自然竭力推廣、在市塲爭辦雙馬牌紗、於是雙馬牌紗的鋒頭獨健、價錢獨俏、講到紗的品質並不特優於一天女」也、</p>
<h3>印棉同業買賣　有三千件之鉅</h3>
<p>本棉交易依然沉悶、惟印棉同業互做賣買、異常典奮、此項成交、大槪轉輾售於廠方爲多數、惟本廠因金融緊急關係、購辦尚無起色之望、查本日同行中成交有三千件之巨、均係棧交、行情續升三四元不等、蘇北來源又見减少、碼頭上到通州花僅二十八包、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>白洛去　一〇六·〇〇　七·七五　同業中進　四五〇件　超片棧交</p>
<p>打包花　一一〇·〇〇同業中進　二四八件　又又</p>
<p>惠司登　一〇·九·二五　又〇〇〇件　又又</p>
<p>來貢花　一二〇·〇〇又　二〇〇　件滙劃棧交</p>
<p>白洛去　一〇七·七五又　二〇〇　件鈔票棧交</p>
<p>平果爾　八六·七五又　三〇〇件　又又</p>
<p>來貢花　九九·〇〇又　四〇〇件　又又</p>
<p>惠司登　一三六·〇〇又　二〇〇件　滙劃棧交</p>
<p>白洛去　一〇八·二五又　二〇〇件　鈔票棧交</p>
<p>辛特花　八五〇五〇又　三〇〇件　又又</p>
<p>杜力拉　一一〇·〇〇　日華廠進　二〇〇件　又　又</p>
<p>另一消息、滬埠外棉交易、殊爲靜寂、華廠方面、存底雄厚、暫不購辦、惟日廠之存底、據可靠之數字、已不敷一月之用、故日來在市向同業方面吸收現貨、付款期均遲至本月下旬也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初開盤、因利物浦及孟買來電良好、價漲三五磅音、同業及海外棉商在市購辦、殊爲踴躍、據因南方現貨市塲、價格之堅定及一部份空頭之抵補、市價再度上漲、收盤時價格殊爲挺秀、較之上日漲十四五磅音、華盛頓方面消息、政府前所擬定之新棉貸款之定價、政府深恐公佈後、貸款存棉再度增加、故暫時不予公佈之、昨日印度連同預測漲一羅比、埃及棉漲十磅音、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋暴騰　囤戶向國布活動</h3>
<p>國布　東疋暴漲、國布廠盤雖昂、而同業手貨已較東疋廉宜、</p>
<p>故本街批發號染廠及囤戶齊起活動、粤港南洋各帮、需胃亦强、市盤逐步提漲、結果輕重磅粗布漲二角半至五角、細布·細斜漲一角至二角半、嗶嘰·綫呢每碼漲一二分、色布·絨布開價亦上騰三五角之譜、本街成交最盛、計粗布·細布·斜紋·色布五百餘件、客路粤港南洋帮進細斜·色布·色斜·漂布四五千疋、此路烟津帮購嗶嘰·綫呢·絨布·粗布一百餘件、甬紹帮辦粗布·色布·色斜一百數十包、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>昨白貨細布·細斜、因天津奏皇島北路客帮繼續盟進、售盤每疋一致在跳七八角、十二磅龍頭細布現貨每疋升至十六元二角半、本月份棧單十六元五角、九月份做開十六元七角、北帮艘辦各牌現貨千餘件、本街同業及染廠後市以現鈔貼水暴縮、進胃亦濃、成交五六百件、行方售開下月份龍頭細布價爲十六元七角半、三桃細布十五元五角、五福細布十五元七角半、但件額不多、市氣甚銳、色貨四君子嗶嘰直貢津帮亦購進一百數十箱、日商不肯多開、市盤已一再提升、每碼爲四角六分半、</p>
<p>二日有疋頭十五件運運香</p>
<h3>糧食　仍在囤米　各貨都開限綫</h3>
<p>杜米　各路來貨疎通後、昨車輪包子又有二千餘包、而河下未到、聞於下午方可抵埠、計有南港及松江十一儎、由小輪拖滬、至銷塲方面、自前一度回平、昨則本街店胃又見活潑、囤戶亦乘機拉進、致形勢頓緊、各貨一律上升、結果厚薄粳價叉守限綫、杜洋尖價亦加三四角不一、變兀去路不活、市形平定、計做開無錫宿粳二十元、松江包薄二十元、斛見十九元七角、羊尖十九元三四角、杜尖十八元八角、蕪尖十六元、宿熱十五元六角、砶尖十五元四角、變元二十一元半至二十一元、成交數共四千三百餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　產地開禁之說、曾一再傳說於市、惟昨尚未得到電訊、隨在本街店舖零戶暢辦之際、再度趁機扳俏、大市貨以下之機砶糙米售價、叉在十六元限盤、提高二三四角不等、進出兩活、全日成交有四千多包</p>
<h3>紛銷活潑　整批仍加限制　麥市步入佳境</h3>
<p>現粉市銷、續呈活潑之象、南北兩帮均有指辦、本街及內地零星去化、亦續形鬧熱、故市面尚堅、各廠以目下外麥原料價貴、本麥市情、亦屬一動即漲、故對於大票客囤交易、仍加限制、而市上之回籠貨、籌碼已枯、亦復不肯賤脫也、統市本客成交併計的近四萬包、二號粉廠盤一律五元現鈔、聞回籠貨售價、則較廠盤別小五分至一角云、</p>
<p>新麥來源、續見湧旺、除蘇·崑·京·鎭等麥續到外管店·烏衣等處、亦已絡繹而來、自前日華廠正式購辦新麥後、囤戶方面、更爲貧取、故市面步入佳境、昨福新廠續辦二千包、本街囤戶進辦的有三千餘包、蘇州高麥價爲六元九角、崑山八角八分、常州七角六分、浦鎮丹陽及烏衣麥五角七分至五角三分、市面堅挺、</p>
<h3>雜糧　生仁軋缺再漲</h3>
<p>生仁因邇來到存軋缺、一再少升、查未開出、客貨統市　　　十包、預計有斷檔之虞、故大洋莊生仁南規售盤又升五元、昨已達三十元矣、</p>
<p>雜糧類中之豆子、今有二百三十五包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖回鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市據海外電訊、均乏更動、公會劃盤、市勢轉軟、二四粗白現貨降六角、本棧三十三元四角、外棧三十三元三角、轉口貨降五角、爲二十五元、太古車白亦小二角、西棧B嘜三十八元四角、CW嘜三十八允一角、CH嘜三十七元八角、DY嘜三十七元四角、HX嘜一三十七元二角、H嘜車赤小五角、爲二十二元辦、荷赤現貨小一角為二十九元、轉口二十一元二角、餘乏上落、國糖以貼水見鬆、市勢稍平、僅開出黃崗靑六十餘包、二十六元八角、餘未成交、又昨日嗬　來糖一萬八千包、</p>
<h3>海味　暹淡有售開</h3>
<p>—價較前漲十元—</p>
<p>邏邏淡菜、今年產量不豐、故久乏到貨、查此間尚有存積、勉堪應銷、惟因外滙關係、設有來源必難合劃、昨售開中淡爲現鈔價八十八元、比前漲起十元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　印度烟煤　各行操縱抬價</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、前月份各行定貨到埠、雖達兩萬餘噸、但市塲同行拆價、不但未見回鬆、抑且力持高盤、塊煤每噸會開至七十元、前後步漲三十元之多、本街店家、爲應銷起見、不得不隨市收進、門莊零售、每籮九元、尚難博蠅利云，</p>
<h3>五金　新鋼板津帮搜辦</h3>
<p>新鋼板市面、因供過於求、故價又高、昨天津帮因有需要、已向本街同業批定數百担、以便有船期時再行裝往、而本埠船廠家及機器廠等、亦略有點綴、行情一節、較前又好起十元光景、刻市如二厘半售四十二元、五厘與七厘半均開三十五元、一分沽二十八元、一分半起至厚花色開價則在二十五元左右云、</p>

<h3>滬城問答（二）</h3>
<p>經片刻沉寂，西人又發問曰：「異哉！旣非習勤，又非壯觀，何爲而設，誠不可解。「答曰：「此乃業此者租地作貿易耳。」西人曰：「君家鬥口肯任人租賃乎？國家城門，誰敢出租，豈堂堂官員亦貪此小利耶。」答曰：「此非大憲意也，」西人曰：</p>
<p>大憲何不禁之。」答曰：「難言之矣！查城淡以內，例禁造屋，上年造屋幾徧，爲大憲所覺，飭令全拆，乃延至數月之久僅拆去其半。當其造也，不數日而成，及其拆也，至如此之遲滯，蓋令之行不及利之能行也。西人曰：「此固無法可施，有任其堆積擁擠而已，久之又久之，人之欲遊上海者，不將不得其門而入乎。」答曰：「或者實有用意深遠，阻人莫人之故，吾儕小民實不得而知，君海外人，何必饒舌。諺云：各人自掃鬥前雪，一休管人家瓦上霜，君亦請事斯語可乎。一西人曰：「噫！旣云各人自掃鬥前雪，何貴國之城門前，竟不自料理乎。今夫月城爲關防鎖鑰要地，現新北門月城中，忽開眼鏡店一家，小東門則開荳腐干店烟桿攤各一家，大東門則開書坊布店各一家，似此咫尺關要之處，以任令居住，倘有意外疎虞，其咎將誰任歟。」　　明日刋登　抲抽豐</p>

<h3>普格喬</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>看了「普格喬」，馬上得使人想起夏伯陽」，一個是農奴時代領導革命的首領，一個是後來被組織成正式紅軍攻打白俄軍隊游擊隊的領袖；方法雖然不同，時代雖然不同，但一種反抗，革命灼熱的心，却完全相同的。</p>
<p>但爲什麽「普格喬」到最後，竟遭慘敗，而「夏伯陽」却始終成爲紅軍首領中一個戰鬥力最强能利用游擊戰的軍事首領呢？道，正如列寗說的話。。</p>
<p>「那時農民還十分愚昧，他們不會團結起來，他們在城市工人中沒有助手和兄弟，但農民仍然照他們所會的，所能的鬥爭着。農民不怕政府野蠻的討伐，農民不怕鞭打，不怕槍彈。」</p>
<p>但是在這决（一七七三—一七七四）農奴的革命戰爭裏，究竟沒有帶來了新的制度，新的生產方法；更其是一般剛由農奴解放出來的戰士，他們對於革命，政治的意識，都糢糊得很，那時他們唯一的要求，正如史太林說過，他們反對地主，只是希望有一個「好皇帝」。</p>
<p>「普格喬」—這一個流傳於俄國民間的「草莽英雄」終於在十七世紀率領了六十萬農奴，，在俄國革命史上，作了一年轟轟烈烈的鬥爭，這决反抗地主的革命雖然遭遇了嚴重的打擊，但是，在俄國農民的身上，已經灌注了一决革命的血液。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>當蘇聯製片廠，正在大量製作歷史影片的時候，在上海，我們先後看到了「彼得大帝」以及這一張「普格喬」。</p>
<p>「彼得大帝」是復興俄國的起點，由了他的努力，才有後來新興的俄國；而「普格喬」能給予我們什麼敎訓呢？</p>
<p>這一個「草莽英雄，」他的慘遭失敗，與有六十萬農奴參與這個鬥爭，它正予抗戰中的中國不少値得學習的地方：</p>
<p>（一）普格喬爲了領導這個鬥爭，竟把他的家庭妻子兒女都丟開了；</p>
<p>（二）當他發現革命的同伴中，有反叛他的時候，他很寬大的饒恕了他，他說，現在不是淸算的時候，這是應該大家携手合作的時候；</p>
<p>（三）普格喬不單是一個英勇果敢的革命領袖，同時他對於敵人與友人分得淸淸楚楚的，當巴斯基爾族人因反抗沙皇的壓迫和普格喬携手合作以後，中間有過一段小小的誤會，但普格喬却用了最大的誠意，使巴斯基爾族人重新和他握手。</p>
<p>這些，正是普格喬最偉大的地方，但是普格喬的失敗，還是那麽樸實地在影片中指示無遺，如軍隊沒有組織，沒有利用新的作戰方法，允其是前面舉出的兩點。</p>
<p>所以，歷史並絕對不是。古董」原封不動的搬出來，我們得透過新的歷史觀，批判地接受歷史上的教訓。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>「普格喬」每一塲戲都顯示着農奴時代民衆們對於皇室及地主的憤恨與動搖，不單是平民如此，所謂作戰的皇軍，同樣不肯爲皇室效勞。</p>
<p>劇本對於農奴，囚徒的怨恨，以及革命蔓延開來一種火熱，歡快的狀態，是把握得再强固沒有的。農奴的歡呼，與檢閱皇軍俘虜時農民戰士們的譁聲大笑，它是深深地動人心弦的：導演彼得洛夫。貝多夫，不單在這些地方抓得很緊，就是寫人情，戰爭的情感，氣氛也都恰到好處：普格喬與他妻子的分離；進攻喀山城的戰爭塲面；普格喬戰敗後，沿着灣灣河流上，烽火數點，胡茄嗚咽，凄凉，哀愁的意味，更直逼人心。</p>
<p>我相信，貝多夫是一個好的導演。</p>
<p>但劇本中缺點自然是有的，比如劇本在許多轉變過程中，都是寫得很不够的，更其是用字慕來說明一個新的階段，這不是一個聰明的手法。</p>
<p>演員飾普格喬的史果洛巴加多夫雄闊的大動作與一種堅强的性格，異常可愛；飾他妻子的柯略京娜，樸質，溫情，是一個少見的演員。</p>
<h3>賭塲侍者的自白</h3>
<p>— 謝天申</p>
<p>為了生活暫以刑塲為棲之地　羡慕他們的人請另謀光明之路</p>
<p>不是　張賭塲侍者生活的優裕，也不是替賭塲作宣傳，在那混濁的漩渦中去求生，實在不是我底願望：因爲受着環境的窘迫，便支配了我的意向，而在一所刑塲中充當一名侍役。</p>
<p>賭塲侍者在職業上，已爲一部失業或低薪的人們所垂涎，羨慕着，但他們沒有經歷過，而不知充當侍役的苦衷，他們也有化數百金欲在賭塲中謀一侍職，往往未遂如願。我的能够在賭塲中謀一職，半靠人事，半賂金錢，才助成我底目前職業。</p>
<p>每日工作的時間，是由下午一時至九時（上班）共八小時。每隔旬日，便把時間更調一次，是自晚九時起至翌日晨五時（下班）止，這樣時間上服務的分配，是循環不絕的。</p>
<p>我的任務，是招待賭塲內的賓客及高級職員，在工作期間，整個身體不得自由，束羈着，待人使喚。至於我們的報酬，按日計算的，倘若一天缺席，便在月薪內照扣一天工資。此外，還有『大烟钱」（外快），這種額外的獲得，是平時招待賓客殷勤，而賭客對你發生好感，在博勝後，酌給一點小費，以酬你殷勤底美意。這樣每月的收入，在這「米珠薪桂」潮中，也足以維持一家九口的生活。</p>
<p>凡是賭塲內的職員，不得在塲內參與賭博，這條規律是東主所訂立，執行非常嚴厲。東主因爲感到職員在塲內，有失觀瞻，疏忽職務，並且如果博贏的話，不免更使雄心勃勃，倘若輸的話，當然在經濟上發生問題，職員的不幸，間接舞弊公款或直接影響營業。</p>
<p>這樣的生活和工作，外人似乎覺得我們很淸閑，而薪水與外快那麼豐收，足爲他們所涎慕。但我們終日爲賭客的舒適而忙碌着，決沒一刻時間讓你平靜地休息一下。</p>
<p>末後，寄語一般羨慕我們的同胞們；在這萬惡，汚濁，無道德，導人自戕的陷阱去求生，的確不是一件光榮的事業，還是另謀別的光明正當事業爲妙。我之所以在那給社會唾駡的賭窟去謀生，不過暫時目前生活而已。我底一篇自白，不僅是向各界披露我們生活一點情形，並且向羨慕我們職美的同胞作一個驚惕！</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　烟火千家鄉村合作　波濤萬里瀛海飛行</p>
<p>何優玉聽得如此說，勾住了雙玉的脖子，連呼：『好姐姐』！親吻不已。諸位！可不是說何雙玉，何儷玉，兩個是雙胞胎嗎？誰是姐姐？誰是妹妹？這個問題，如今還不能解決。但社會上的習慣，總是以先出母胎的爲長，後出母胎的爲决。究竟雙玉比優玉先出世的摸二十分鐘，雖然兩個嬰孩是一摸一樣的，可是助產的這位醫士，却把她們認淸了的。後來她們的母親何太太，也依照着社會上習俗，以雙玉先出世二十分鐘爲姊，儷玉後出世二十分鐘爲妹了。到了長大時，家中並不大小姐二小姐的稱呼她們，但兩人之中，顯然要分出一個先後，因此她們有時也姊妹相呼了。現儷玉見雙玉說：倘然到美國考察以及購買機器等事，願意讓她先去，遂了她心中之願，所以她非常高興。因爲此刻從中國到美國去，乘飛機是非常便利，由上海到紐的，至多不過五天。在太平洋上飛來飛去，不算一回事，好像江浙人渡過太湖一般容易。原來橫斷太平洋的國際民航飛行，在一千九百三十五年的秋間，已經開始了。最先是從美國的舊金山出發，到菲列濱的馬尼刺爲終點，這還不過是試航。可是就顯得儘管你怎樣的在洋巨浸，不能阻止你的犬外翱翔。到一九三七年的春天，這一條航綫，便達到香港爲止，總算是完成了中美間的直接空航。這一段航空路綫，全程達八千七百餘英里，而且都在海洋上空飛行，這眞是航空界的一大進步咧。那是只是舊金山與香港往來，因爲中國各地，都鬧着與日本戰爭的事，所以連上海幾處大商埠，民航也不能直接飛來。一直到戰事平定以後，汎美公司的巨型機，方可以來到上海。那時候，中國的國際飛航，已是四通八達。除了這汎美公司的太平洋巨型飛機，每一個星期便有一架到遠東來以外。還有英帝國航空公司，什麽中緬錢，中暹錢，中印綫，中星綫，（中國至星加坡）都開通了。至於中越綫，由法國航空公司辦理的，從昆明直飛河內的，在十年前，早已完成。而由上海直飛巴黎的的一錢，也在三十年前，經中法航空公司開辦了。（一六六）</p>

<h3>有聲電影的妙用</h3>
<p>— 德綱</p>
<p>有聲電影除供人視聽之娛外，在法國最近有人發明利用有聲電影作爲許多法律事件的紀錄，最普通的是利用有聲電影紀錄遺囑。立遺囑的人，除了筆寫外，同時宣讀遺囑，由開麥拉將遺囑中的辭句和當時立囑人及其他證人等，一併攝入片中，日後如有糾紛只需將片子放映，便能解決一切，較之單依遺囑爲憑，可靠萬倍。因爲文書有僞造的可能，而影片則絕無作假的方法。</p>
<p>最近法國有許多市政府中，都有拍攝有聲電影機的設備，凡遇有較重要之法律手續，須在市政府舉行者，如結婚離婚等，都由開麥拉攝下，拷貝兩份，一份留置市府，另一份交給當事人保存。</p>
<p>道種片子，較普通影戲片爲小，祗有十六米厘，很適宜在家庭中放映，所以父母物故後，幼輩們若將尊長們遺言片子時常放映，便無異重睹先人之音容，這倒很合我國愼終追遠的古訓。</p>
<h3>影星照片競賣揭曉</h3>
<p>— 銀絲</p>
<p>顧蘭君一照六千金·陳雲裳名列第二·</p>
<p>中國電影明星照片展覽會，爲售款救難，從上月廿七日起，到昨天爲止舉行義賣八天。會塲中除了羅列全電影界名星照片一千餘幅外，並有卅吋放大彩色照片十大明星各一張公開競賣。</p>
<p>竸賣結果</p>
<p>在熱心救難，和鼓勵優良藝人兩重觀點之下，顧蘭君陳雲裳兩位小姐的照片，同時引起了最劇烈的競爭。顧小姐的照片，從出價五百元起，兩位競購人一千二千地迭番增價，直至加到六千元，方於前晚裁定。結果情形：顧蘭君第一名，六千元。（愼大洋行一大山人購得）陳雲裳第二名，五千元。）普克洋行馬君購得）童月娟第三名，三百元。（霍君購得）其决路明，李紅，周璇等三位小姐的照片是各售一百元。同時一大山人並將全會塲所有的顧蘭君照片，一律按値給價，囊括以去。這番競爭情形，可說然烈極了！</p>
<p>姊妹到塲</p>
<p>昨大下午四時，展覽會宣告結束。當請林康侯先生，顧蘭君小姐到塲舉行閉幕授照典禮。顧小姐當下偕同胞妹莉君小姐蒞會，姊妹花一式藍布旗袍，一雙兩好，淡雅宜人。林先生和她見面之後，便向速聲：「大功臣」「大功臣」的讚許不置。有人說照這次競賣所得，不下兩萬元，很可以爲難民造福，盼望該會主持人早些辦理公佈的手續。</p>
<p>林顧演說</p>
<p>舉行閉幕禮時，林康侯先生起立演說，自言：「年紀活到六十四歲，從沒有聽到過一張照片會値到六千元錢，但這確就是在目前的事實……二」詞多趣妙，甚見發噱。嗣由顧小姐致謝詞，鶯聲嚦地說着一口電影化的國語：「我很慚愧，我為拍戲太忙，並沒有為難民怎樣効力；這裏我願捐出一百元錢，聊表微　……」態度很大方，措詞也　　體，　然象當年胡蝶女士的作派。</p>
<p>最後，由顧小姐授照與承購人，攝影，散會，而就此完成了這番義賣的功德。</p>

<p>戲演完了，因爲生意很好，所以贏餘很多。雖然我一分錢沒有得到，但是我却得到了比錢更貴重的東西，那就是我的信心。由這决的經騐，告訴了我，只要肯吃苦，肯努力，天下沒有辦不到的事。『有志者事竟成』更成了我的金科玉律。</p>
<p>後來，不意遭逢着人家賜給我許多排擠，忌妒，欺侮，中傷種種不能忍的打擊。我考慮了很久，我决定別謀途徑，我不願意，再蜷伏在別人的脚底下等着人的憐惜，於是我脫離了舞台，跳上了銀慕，即就是說我離開了娘家，到了婆家，——和婆家也發生了關係。</p>
<p>前面只是說些我與舞台和銀幕發生關係的經過，現在再談我現在的情形：自八一三以後，整個的中國是換了一番新面目了，一切都在革新，一切都在進步，所以當去年影片公司都關着門的時候，我的娘家也以一付改革後新的姿態復活了，要我回去，我爲了素來對舞台的喜愛，同時感到也應該爲這孤島上僅有的爲劇運努力的圑體効勞，所以我忘了一切舊怨，毫不猶疑同來了。</p>
<p>後來，影片公司慢慢地也都相繼開門了，新華公司要我做基本演員，爲了我對婆家也同樣的喜愛，所以我也毫不猶疑的答應了。不過沒有像上决一樣完全脫離了娘家，只是在彼此不衝突的時候，兩面工作着，所以有時跑上舞台，有時跳上銀幕的兩邊奔忙，從去年一直到現在還是這樣。</p>
<p>最後，該說的是我將來的希望了！我覺得在中國女演員的的演戲的壽命實在是太短了，假使相終身從事道種工作只靠作演員是不可能的，看着一批一批消沉沒落的老演員就是一個很好的例子，所以爲了想貫澈我自己的主張，把影戲當作終身的事業起見，我有了一個作導演的計畫，我預備在不能作演員時，作導演，好使得這終身的事業不至於中途停斷了。好在我一向是抱着『有志者事竟成』的信心，只要我不斷的努力，不斷的學習，我想憑着我對影戲的這點執議與信心，也許不至於遭到娘家與婆家的擯拒吧？</p>

<h3>Chamberlain Issues Another Statement: Britain's Far East Policy Unchanged; Emphasizes Extreme Importance of Potential US Cooperation; Both Countries Have the Same Goals but Need Not Adopt the Same Methods</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, during a foreign policy debate in the House of Commons today, stated that if anti-British riots in North China continue and attacks on British interests there remain unchecked, the British government will have to take a very serious view of the situation. The Prime Minister reiterated that the British government will not alter its Far East policy at the request of other countries. He clarified that the Anglo-Japanese agreement reached in Tokyo is merely a statement of facts, does not imply a shift in policy or recognition of Japan's belligerent rights, does not disregard British interests in China, nor does it intend to cede any rights to third parties. The Prime Minister mentioned recent actions by the United States, saying he believes the general objectives of Britain and the United States are very similar. However, it is not necessary for the two countries to take the same actions. The Prime Minister added that the government attaches extreme importance to possible cooperation between the two countries, and he will keep the United States informed of British actions and planned measures. (Great applause)</p>
<h3>Sinclair Sympathizes with China</h3>
<p>The first speaker today was Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the Liberal opposition party, who said that Britain cannot be neutral in the Sino-Japanese war, as British sympathy must naturally lean towards China. Sinclair also questioned whether the recently proposed Anglo-Japanese compromise would hinder the government's assistance to China, and whether the government would refuse to hand over the silver currently in Tianjin to avoid weakening China's ability to resist. He urged the government to consult with the various dominions as soon as possible to take action on Anglo-Japanese trade. Sinclair concluded, "Do not allow Britain to lose another opportunity to cooperate with the United States in the Far East." (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Opposition Labour MP Dalton immediately launched a fierce attack on the government, stating briefly that, given the situation in the Far East, the government's efforts to support Chinese legal tender should not be abandoned, and the export of raw materials to Japan must be prohibited. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Elaborates on Policy</h3>
<p>The Prime Minister then rose to reply, saying that merely knowing the superficial explanations of the plan is insufficient to understand its main purpose. He said that these explanations, which are sufficient to cause concern and distress in China, are created by those who have not made a thorough and fair review of the plan. The government has already made this clear to us. It must be known that this plan is a statement of facts, not implying a change in policy or recognition of Japan's belligerent rights, nor disregarding British trade in China, nor intending to cede any rights to third countries. Sir Archibald Sinclair asked whether the meaning of this plan is that Britain will help Japan maintain what it has gained and not hinder its continued seizures. He wondered why Sir Sinclair would make such strange remarks. If what Sir Sinclair said is true, wouldn't we be supplying good weapons to someone who does not have good intentions towards us? (Applause) Such remarks are not only harmful, but also sufficient to weaken our influence in the world. I reiterate that the government will not change its Far East policy at the request of other countries, and I would also like to declare that Japan has not asked us to do so. In the delicate negotiations currently underway, there are bound to be many difficulties ahead. The most obvious is the anti-British riots instigated and controlled by the Japanese in North China. I now have no choice but to say that if such riots continue and British interests in North China continue to be attacked as before, the British government will have to take a very serious view of the situation. These facts may make it extremely difficult to obtain satisfactory results from the negotiations. The Prime Minister also mentioned China's silver, saying that he must fully discuss this issue with other countries with equal interests before it can be discussed. (Reuters)</p>
<h3>Eden Speaks Up for Justice</h3>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Eden, after rising to speak, stated briefly that the Prime Minister's statement regarding the situation in the Far East was righteous and commendable. One point regarding the Far East situation is very clear: the Japanese government's plan for China has failed. It is particularly difficult to see when the Sino-Japanese War can end, and looking back two years, it feels even more distant. Since last autumn, Chinese morale, public sentiment, and organizational capabilities have been revived. In the un-occupied areas, not only has the army been reorganized, but industry is also being rebuilt. We admire this and should warmly commend it. Japan, unable to achieve a complete victory militarily, wants to promote the collapse of China's monetary system to achieve its victory. Its demand that Britain hand over Chinese silver in the Tianjin concession to the Japanese side and recognize the banknotes of banks controlled by the Japanese is nothing more than an attempt to weaken the position of Chinese legal tender. Now it is trying to induce Britain to collude with it. If Britain were to do so, it would be tantamount to accepting a foreign diktat and changing its policy. The impact would harm the interests of our country in China and in various territories in the East, which is unacceptable. It is gratifying that the Prime Minister has firmly stated that he will not change the policy towards China at the request of foreign countries. I also hope that the government will take a further step to make it clear that it will continue to support Chinese legal tender, which would be even better. Now is the time that if British-Japanese relations are to be improved, the condition should be that Japan ceases instigating anti-British activities in China. As for us, Britain does not lack the ability to act. How this action can be taken can be seen in the US declaration to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce. If our government can announce this intention to the Japanese government, national opinion will undoubtedly support it. (Havas)</p>
<h3>Milner Supports the Government</h3>
<p>Conservative MP Milner then rose to speak, saying that he was very pleased with the Prime Minister's clear remarks and found them very satisfactory. He then mentioned the Japanese demands regarding Chinese legal tender, asking whether the Prime Minister could make a further statement, not only declaring that Britain will not support Japan's demands, but will also seek to prevent them from becoming a reality. Milner also said that he believed Britain had no reason not to imitate the United States and abolish the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce. He then mentioned the Tokyo plan, saying that if Japan only uses what is included in its literal meaning, he believes this matter is a victory for British diplomacy. However, the whole problem now is what the result of the compromise will be, and whether the British side has any demands. If Japan asks Britain to support its currency, it will inevitably lead to an extremely difficult situation. Milner continued, saying that we are bound by treaties and long-term friendship to support the freedom and independence of a complete China. Britain should take any means to force Japan to withdraw from the impossible position created by the mistakes and arrogance of its leaders. Milner concluded, saying that although Britain has sufficient means, such as economic or financial retaliation, to force the Japanese government to change its treatment of British interests, he would rather resolve this matter through cooperation and friendly discussions.</p>
<h3>Butler Concludes the Debate</h3>
<p>Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Butler concluded the debate, saying that negotiations on the Tianjin incident are still ongoing. Certain points regarding police affairs have been agreed upon and are now being reported to the government for consideration. Part of the next procedure will be the consideration of economic and other matters. Butler also mentioned various events regarding police affairs, saying that the government has now decided, according to the accepted plan, to recognize the de facto situation, and to maintain a fair attitude towards certain daily contacts within a limited area and under certain circumstances. Butler continued, saying that he believes that this attitude of acknowledging the de facto situation in the Japanese-occupied areas is the wisest policy for the interests of British expatriates in the Far East and for British policy. Butler concluded by saying that Britain has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government regarding the anti-British riots in North China.</p>
<p>(London) The Labour opposition party intends to hold another foreign policy debate when the government moves to adjourn the House of Commons for the summer recess on August 4th. They will pay particular attention to the overall situation in the Far East. (Reuters, 1st) The diplomatic affairs correspondent of the London Times recently declared, "The British government has clearly analyzed and re-stated its policy toward China, including the points announced by Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, and has even supplemented them. All of these have been included in instructions to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, instructing him to convey them to the Chinese government. Therefore, Britain's efforts to deal with factual issues in North China do not mean that there has been any change in its policy toward China. In other words, it is not a betrayal of China. On the contrary, the British government will continue to maintain its current policy as before." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Comments</h3>
<p>(London) Chamberlain's foreign policy speech has been commented on by various newspapers here. The London Times stated, "Analyzing the international policies pursued by the British government, its main goal in the Far East is to strive for a fair resolution to the war between China and Japan. Its guiding principle is to maintain a position that allows it to exert influence and accomplish this task in the most effective way." The News Chronicle stated that regarding the Far East situation, Chamberlain reiterated in a solemn tone that the initial agreement reached between Britain and Japan does not mean that Britain has changed its Far East policy. This is greatly reassuring. Regarding the relationship between Britain and the United States, there have been many rumors. Chamberlain has now stated that the British government will always notify the US government of all its actions or intended actions. This is also welcomed by the general public. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the US Visits Hull</h3>
<p>(Washington) After the US government announced the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, Japanese Ambassador to the US Kensuke Horinouchi visited Secretary of State Hull at the State Department for the first time yesterday. The two held talks for half an hour in an effort to reconcile the differences between the US and Japan. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain's Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>"The inaccurate interpretations made by various parties regarding the initial agreement between Britain and Japan are sufficient to cause anxiety and distress in China and should be condemned." This was the solemn statement made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, July 31, when he declared foreign policy. Since the initial agreement was announced, Japan and Germany and Italy have been pleased, and public opinion has been in an uproar. This newspaper has also repeatedly reviewed and condemned it. Is it because of Chamberlain's view of the inaccurate interpretations, all those within his condemnation? Although, ambiguity lies, how accurate is the interpretation? Unilateral consent, almost its toadying demeanor is visible, then empty talk is insufficient to release anxieties, sweet words are insufficient to release bitterness, what remains is to await the facts that are expressed by future Tokyo negotiations as strong irrefutable evidence! Currently, it is somewhat comforting that Chamberlain is able to pay attention to the reaction caused by the initial agreement in China and feel deeply uneasy, then this person is still able to discuss Britain's future and the Far East's future.</p>
<p>The British Parliament is scheduled to adjourn the day after tomorrow, August 4, and will reconvene in two months, on October 3. What Chamberlain declared yesterday was the final statement in this session, so its quality and quantity are more important than usual. He had previously stated that he was unwilling to clearly guarantee that Britain's foreign policy would not change at all during the recess period. This is indeed a sign of a politician being responsible to Parliament and valuing promises, and should not be regarded as Chamberlain taking advantage of the two-month opportunity of Parliament's recess to change his foreign policy. In other words, what was declared yesterday should be regarded in principle as the norm for British foreign policy in the next two months. If there are changes, it will be an accident. Given the clarity and explicitness of the statement, we sincerely hope that there will be no accidents and no changes, and we wish to introduce it to our readers, who should read carefully what is recorded in today's news column of this newspaper, for use as a reference for observing British foreign policy in the next two months.</p>
<p>Chamberlain's statement has four main items: one concerns the Far East, two concerns the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, three concerns Danzig, and four concerns British loans to Poland. Regarding the Far East, there are eight main points: (1) not abandoning British interests in China, (2) not sacrificing the rights of third countries, (3) not damaging Britain's reputation and weakening its influence in various parts of the world, (4) not changing Far East policy at the request of other countries, (5) confirming that the anti-British movement was launched and directed by Japan, and that at least in North China, if Japan does not stop it, it will hinder the success of the Tokyo negotiations, (6) the Tianjin silver problem must be decided only after exchanging opinions with all relevant countries, (7) the US and Britain have the same goals for the Far East, but their actions need not be the same, and it may be more beneficial to have different actions, and (8) cooperation with the United States should be valued, as should that potential for cooperation. Some may think that there are not many new suggestions; however, in our view, we would like readers to pay special attention to the fact that there are subtleties between the US and Britain that cannot be ignored. According to the process since September 18, the intentions of the US and Britain have often been discussed; except for the protest against Japan in January of this year, and the subsequent Gulangyu issue, there was seemingly a parallel view between the two countries; in addition, whether rigid or soft, whether strained or relaxed, almost making those who care about world affairs find it laughable and sad. Not only that, but the interpretations and criticisms made by the various parties that are implicitly opposed to the US and Britain regarding the intentions of the two countries are also divergent and complicated; regarding their parallel actions, they are regarded as coincidental; regarding their consultations, they are regarded as being inside and out; and regarding their motives, they are regarded as the two countries colluding to deal with Japan, or as the two countries disagreeing and vying for hegemony in the Far East. Of course, there is only one truth about these rights and wrongs; there is only one principle about front and back; yet those who interpret and criticize, even though they stand on the side of dissatisfaction with the US and Britain, are different in right and wrong, and in front and back, so why is this the case? This can explain that international problems are far-reaching, so those who are concerned about gains and losses in the midst of them are each seeking their own interests and falling into the contradictions of front and back, right and wrong; it can also explain that the content of international problems is complex, so those who sow discord in the midst of them are trying their best to instigate destruction for their own private interests. As for the US and Britain, Chamberlain's statement that the two countries have the same goals is indeed not deceptive talk, and it is certainly appropriate to say that the two countries have the same basic tone for Far East policy; only because those who see them as goals differ in their perceptions of distance, size, and the inherent conditions for reaching their goals, so that what is expressed in words and actions differs in urgency and importance, and it is not that there is a fundamental conflict between them. For example, the two countries have the same views on stopping Far East aggression; however, whether it can be stopped, how it can be stopped, and when it can be stopped, the distinction lies not in the essence of that objective object, but in the disparity in perceptions and conditions. To prove this, with the abrogation of the Treaty of Commerce, US President Roosevelt subtly operated, and the opposition leader made this proposal, and without waiting for the parliament to pass it, he resolutely did so; while Britain spoke openly of economic sanctions at the beginning of the blockade of the Tianjin concession, and yesterday still said that the opinions of the autonomous territories needed to be consulted. Furthermore, it is proven by the so-called cooperation between the two countries, that the key to Britain lies in the hesitation of the authorities, but when the authorities have no hesitation, they only seek cooperation; the key to the United States lies in public opinion, and when there are measures that are approved by public opinion, they want to take them with an independent posture, without giving up their isolationist consciousness and cooperating. Chamberlain's yesterday's statement on the US and Britain was able to see through the subtleties between them, which is a brand new suggestion in Britain.</p>
<p>In yesterday's British House of Commons, there is also something worthy of a related word: the speech of former Foreign Secretary Eden, which was most rich in political and diplomatic meaning, should be understood by putting oneself in his place and appreciating British national policy and Eden's position. The active suggestions of Eden and Sinclair can be mutually illuminated by the distinction between the ruling and opposition parties in the Conservative and Liberal parties. If Wilson is such a person, he said that apart from condemning the Japanese, there is no way to describe what he hates, but he also said that Britain's actions may not be beneficial to the Far East, so he advocated standing aside and waiting for investment in the future; this can represent the weak-willed elements of the Conservative Party, and their words are not worth mentioning, but it is their ilk who often make Britain gray.</p>
<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer States Determination to Maintain Chinese Legal Tender; Original Intention Not Changed Due to Tokyo Agreement; UK, US, and France Actively Discussing Measures; £3 Million Loan to Be Established Immediately</h3>
<p>(London) During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, Opposition Labour MP Jagger asked the government whether it would continue to maintain Chinese legal tender. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon immediately replied, "The stability of Chinese legal tender is of great importance to Britain and other countries that have significant commercial interests in China, and it should be maintained. The British government's view has not changed due to the preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan." Labour MP Price then asked, "The Japanese are now issuing banknotes in the occupied areas of China in an attempt to control these areas financially. I wonder if Your Excellency can provide an assurance that no special assistance will be given to them?" Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon replied, "What I said a moment ago was very detailed, and I see no need to add anything. As for the Japanese attempt to financially control the occupied areas of China, that is another matter." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the British loan of £3 million to China, it is said that Overseas Trade Minister Hudson and Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi may be able to reach an agreement this week, which will be implemented immediately. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) A financial news political reporter reported that the British, French, and US governments are actively discussing the future of Chinese legal tender. This discussion was initiated by the British government, which was forced to take this action by the Japanese monetary demands in the Tokyo negotiations. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the news reported by the Financial News that the British, French, and US governments are actively discussing the future of Chinese legal tender, Reuters has learned that there is good reason to believe that France has agreed in principle. However, the means of supporting Chinese legal tender has not yet been discussed. However, according to general opinion, the future plan for assisting Chinese legal tender needs to be considered very carefully, because the current procedures of the equalization fund have many weaknesses. Financiers believe that assistance to Chinese currency cannot be effective unless strict management is given to the issuance of Chinese banknotes at the same time. The scope of application of the equalization fund in the future should be limited to commerce and should not provide foreign exchange for Chinese banknotes. Today, Conservative MPs, when interviewed by Reuters reporters, seemed to have inconsistent opinions regarding Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday on the British government's Far East policy. Those close to the Prime Minister believe that the government will firmly not concede on important issues in North China, which is very gratifying. However, other MPs want the Prime Minister to make more specific replies to questions such as Japanese currency in North China and Chinese silver stored in concessions. They believe that a clear rejection of Japanese demands in the Tokyo conference is not only the most pleasant, but also the wisest path. The Senate may strive to make the government make a sincere statement on this matter during the debate on Thursday. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic affairs correspondent of the Daily Telegraph reported that the British government is seeking the US government's views on several issues in the Far East that directly affect the interests of both countries. The British government took this step because the United States has recently announced the abrogation of the trade agreement with Japan, expressing its attitude. One issue that is related to both Britain and the US is the Japanese side's hope that Britain will support the currency under the Japanese side's auspices in North China and stop supporting legal tender. It seems that the British government does not feel that it has any intention of reaching peace with Japan. Even if the British government has this intention, it cannot do so without the permission of other directly related countries such as France and the United States. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary to Go to Europe Today</h3>

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Subcommittees Simultaneously Convene Yesterday: Regarding the Silver Deposit Issue, Britain States It Has No Right to Resolve It Alone; Maintaining Order in the Concessions; Rumor of a Provisional Agreement Between the Two Parties</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 7:30 PM that the subcommittee discussing the issue of silver currency held two meetings at the official residence of the Vice Minister, from 10:00 AM to noon and from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM on the 1st. It continued to review the issue and reported the results to Minister Kato and Ambassador Craigie. The subcommittee discussing the issue of security also convened on the same day at the same time as the aforementioned committee and reviewed several outstanding items. (1st, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a foreign ministry announcement, the subcommittee investigating matters related to the silver issue met for two hours this morning and three hours this afternoon. The subcommittee examining the issue of maintaining peace and order in the British concession in Tianjin held a meeting this afternoon to complete the review of several unresolved issues. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) It is heard that a provisional agreement has been reached on the issue of Anglo-Japanese cooperation in maintaining the neutrality of the Tianjin concessions, celebrating it. If the Japanese side can lift the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, the British side is willing to hand over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng. At the same time, it was agreed that the British side would increase its police force within the British concession and allow Japanese military police to cooperate with the British in eliminating terrorist plans. However, Japanese personnel within the British concession cannot exercise administrative power. (1st, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the situation of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie again submitted a report to the Foreign Office this morning. The content reportedly concerns the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case, which has not yet been resolved. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the silver deposit issue at a meeting this morning and has almost drafted new instructions, which will be telegraphed to Ambassador Craigie immediately. Responsible parties here still insist that the financial issue cannot be resolved by Britain alone, because the location of the silver in Tianjin is not limited to the British concession alone. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) People here now acknowledge that the Tokyo negotiations have reached a critical stage. The monetary demands made by the Japanese side cannot be accepted by Britain. The British government is now informing other related countries of the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The French government has stated to the British government that France is well aware of Britain's difficulties in the Far East and the broad scope of the issues involved in economic and military strategy. In fact, it can now be stated with certainty that Anglo-French cooperation in the Far East is no less close than in Europe. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese demand that the silver deposits of Chinese banks within the Tianjin concession, amounting to 48 million Chinese currency, be handed over to the Japanese side, according to sources close to the government, the governments of Britain, the United States, and France are exchanging views on this issue. When Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with British Ambassador Craigie last week, he had already made this request. Because this silver is stored separately in British, American, and French banks, in roughly equal amounts, it is not convenient to make a decision alone before consulting with the United States and France. However, other local issues can still be negotiated, such as the police issue within the concession, which has already achieved some success. (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Anglo-Japanese subcommittee on economic issues met at 10:00 this morning to continue discussing the legal tender and silver deposit issues. The British representatives were Herbert, the British Consul in Tianjin, and Macrae, the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy in Tokyo. The Japanese representatives were Tanaka, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, and Aoki and Asai, Secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is heard that the British representatives requested that financial experts discuss these issues and that experts from Yokohama Specie Bank and HSBC be invited as consultants, striving to reach a compromise. According to Japanese newspapers, the round table conference held its sixth meeting yesterday. Dennis, the Chief of Police of the British Concession in Tianjin, explained the current situation of maintaining peace and order in the British Concession in Tianjin. The meeting then discussed (1) the wording of "controlling anti-Japanese and Communist elements in the British Concession in Tianjin," (2) the dispatch of a certain number of Japanese military police by the British Municipal Council to "maintain mutual cooperation and contact between Britain and Japan to maintain peace and order," and (3) the requirement to first review anti-Japanese and Communist elements found in the concession in the future. According to the Asahi Shimbun, a subcommittee has been appointed to discuss the details. In subsequent discussions, the Japanese representatives insisted on dispatching 30 Japanese military police, while the British side insisted on greatly reducing the number. The subcommittee adjourned at noon and resumed its meeting at 2:00 PM, clarifying two or three points. However, Japanese newspapers stated that no major difficulties were expected and predicted that the issue of peace and order could be finalized this afternoon. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Undersecretary Answers Member's Question: Gives Special Attention to Protecting British Nationals in China</h3>
<p>(London) Undersecretary Butler assured the House of Commons today that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo will give full attention to the interests of British trade in China. Butler also answered another question in writing, stating that the British government has immediately considered raising possible negotiations with the Japanese government regarding the drug situation in the occupied areas of China. Butler further stated that the British government has recently continued to negotiate with the Japanese government through Ambassador Craigie regarding the Japanese authorities' small concession to allow British personnel to inspect the routes of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Company. Labor MP Pethick-Lawrence rose to ask whether the Prime Minister would issue instructions to pay special attention to protecting the well-being of British nationals in China who are suspected or hated by the Japanese. Butler replied that the British authorities in various places will take such measures within the possible scope, but it seems unnecessary to issue special instructions. Pethick-Lawrence then asked Butler whether he knew that British nationals in various parts of North China have been severely affected by the current situation and whether there could be any concrete expression other than making extremely vague remarks. Butler replied that he believed his remarks were extremely concrete and that he was very aware of the concerns of the members. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing, Using British-Made Machine Guns: British MP Questions Government</h3>
<p>(London) Labor MP Purbrick raised a question in the House of Commons today, stating that since January 1937, how many licenses have been issued for the export of Lewis machine guns manufactured by the Birmingham Small Arms Company in Japan. His reason for raising this question was that a Japanese plane shot down in Chongqing on May 3 was equipped with this machine gun, and its number was A52016. Trade Secretary Stanley replied that, judging from the number of the gun, it was exported to Japan in 1933. Publishing the number of licenses for exporting a particular type of weapon to a particular country would be contrary to the public interest. No licenses have been issued for exporting Lewis machine guns to Japan since December 1937. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Women's Comfort Committee Holds Second Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese Women's Comfort Association for Soldiers Fighting for Self-Defense and Resistance held its second anniversary celebration on the 1st.

Chairman Shen Huilian reported on the establishment process and future work guidelines. Madame Chiang delivered an impromptu speech, encouraging them to popularize the organization, visit wounded and sick soldiers, and assist soldiers' families, hoping that women compatriots across the country would provide soldiers with spiritual encouragement. The entire group, led by Madame Chiang, went to the urban area and the south bank of Jiangbei to comfort the families of soldiers on expeditions and wounded soldiers. (1st, Telegram)</p>
<h3>Chinese Seek Refuge Within Puppet Manchuria</h3>

<h3>Japanese Troops Withdraw from Central China, Related to the European Situation; Offensive on Pinghan Railway Used as Cover; Submarine Base Being Built on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman, when meeting with reporters today, spoke of the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese troops from central China, particularly in the Yangtze River basin. It is said that the current offensive by the Japanese on the Pinghan Railway west of southwestern Henan Province is merely an action to cover the withdrawal of their troops from central China. The reason for the withdrawal is probably related to the tense situation in Europe. Two divisions of Japanese troops stationed in Hankou have already withdrawn and are being transported downstream. Their heavy artillery units have been loaded onto trains in Pukou and are being transported north via the Jinpu Railway to Manchuria. However, the destination of the infantry units is not yet known. It is either to the north or south to Hainan Island. Regardless of whether they are transferred to Manchuria or Hainan Island, he is convinced that the recent movements of the Japanese troops have international significance. The Japanese are now rushing to build a submarine base on the southern tip of Hainan Island. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to information received here, the Japanese troops in southern Henan have been intercepted by Chinese troops. The three routes of Japanese troops invading from the Pinghan Railway, attempting to reach Tanghe, were attacked by Chinese troops counterattacking from the north and recapturing Minggang before reaching halfway. The Japanese troops were forced to retreat. (1st, Haitian News Agency)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Southeastern Shanxi Province: Flanking Strategy Effective; Chinese Troops Recapture Yangcheng and Qinshui; Killing Over 2,000 Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman told reporters today that there is heavy rain in southeastern Shanxi Province, so the fighting has stopped. The spokesman spoke of the strategy of the Chinese troops there, saying that when a Japanese force advanced west from the Tongpu Railway towards Yangcheng, the Chinese troops attacked it from the north and south. The Japanese troops spying on Jincheng from the south of Qinshui were attacked by Chinese troops from the east and west. This flanking strategy of the Chinese side has been very successful. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military intelligence: The Japanese troops in southeastern Shanxi Province have been attacked by Chinese troops everywhere in recent days, fleeing in disarray. In the battles to recapture Yangcheng and Qinshui, over 2,000 Japanese troops were killed.

Other units of the Chinese army have also arrived in Baoshan, Jiading, and Qingpu. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Situation in Zhongshan Turns Mild Again</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shiqi telephone: The Japanese troops at Hengmen retreated to their ships last night in succession. The situation in Anjing and Zhongshan, Tangjiawan, has turned mild again. Li Hanhun ordered the dispatch of defense corps from Taishan and Kaiping to Zhongshan to assist in defending the territory. Macao reports that the Japanese troops' attempt to force Shiqi to land at Niushi Bay is inaccurate. To protect the waterways, the Zhongshan authorities have again blockaded the sea entrances at Jinzhong and Shenwan. Ferries and cargo ships traveling between Shiqi and the Siyi area are greatly affected. Navigation between Macao and Shiqi has also been rerouted. The Taikoo Foshan ship, originally scheduled to sail to Guangzhou on the 1st, suddenly changed its schedule. It is rumored that the Japanese troops will start inspecting Chinese in Shameen on the 2nd. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chinese Diplomatic Observer Analyzes the International Situation: US Action of Abrogating Treaty Deals a Major Blow to Japan; Whether British Words Match Actions Remains to Be Seen</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A certain Chinese diplomatic observer here analyzed the international situation, which has a special relationship with the Sino-Japanese War, today, claiming that the US abrogation of the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Japan is tantamount to a clear indication to Britain that if Britain takes the same action, the US will not only protect British and American interests in the Far East but also shatter the Japanese dream of establishing a new order in East Asia. Now there are various reasons to hope that the British government will take a definite stand soon. At present, it is impossible to judge whether Britain's Far Eastern policy can change, but Britain has indeed made concessions to Japan. Whether Chamberlain and Halifax's words match their actions remains to be seen. The abrogation of the US-Japan commercial treaty has a huge spiritual impact on the Chinese side and a demoralizing impact on the Japanese people, which is undeniable. Although the abrogation will only take effect after six months, Japan's import and export trade with the US will inevitably suffer a setback due to the hesitation of American import and export merchants.

Yunnan will definitely not be able to accommodate 100,000 Jews. The opinion of Chinese government officials is that China can only accept a certain number of technical personnel, such as engineers and doctors, as this type of personnel is needed by China.

<h3>British and American Properties in Chongqing are Mostly Concentrated Bombing Points for Japanese Aircraft: Chinese Anti-Aircraft Artillery Shows Great Power; Ferry Terminal is the Only Area Bombed</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Two teams of Japanese planes bombed Chongqing last night, concentrating their bombing on many British and American properties on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Japanese bombs concentrated on the old anchorage of the British warship "Falcon." The British warship was damaged in a recent Japanese bombing of Chongqing. The searchlights of the Chinese air defense forces discovered the tracks of the first team of Japanese planes at 9:30 PM, from east to west. The Chinese anti-aircraft artillery units showed great power, and the Japanese planes' formations were disrupted by the anti-aircraft artillery shells. However, no Japanese planes were shot down. With the help of the bright moon, the Japanese planes flew very smoothly. Conversely, the anti-aircraft artillery units, without dense clouds, also easily found their targets. The second team of Japanese planes was discovered at 10:40 PM, but did not fly over Chongqing, only dropping bombs on the opposite bank of the Yangtze River. The ferry terminal was the only area bombed during both bombings. (1st, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) It is claimed that four Japanese planes were shot down by Chinese planes and anti-aircraft artillery, but Reuters reporters, after inquiring at the Air Force Headquarters and the Air Defense Department, were unable to confirm this claim. The above-mentioned two agencies are currently conducting an investigation. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Eighteen Japanese bombers, divided into two teams, attacked Chongqing last night under the moonlight. The two teams dropped bombs in the same area, namely part of the city and part of the south bank of the Yangtze River. The first team of Japanese planes arrived at 9:30 PM, and the second team arrived an hour later. Both encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire, and Chinese fighter planes rose to intercept them. No fires broke out in any location. The air raid alarm was lifted at 11:20 PM. After the Japanese planes left, Reuters reporters went to the bombed area and found that both banks of the Yangtze River were almost unscathed, as most of the bombs fell into the river. A civilian ship was directly hit by a bomb and blown to smithereens. Two bombs fell on Xiachengdou Road near the riverbank but did not explode. When Reuters reporters arrived on the scene, police and military police cordoned off the road with ropes, preventing traffic for fear of explosion. A red light marked the point where the bomb landed. Several bombs fell on the riverbank, but there were very few casualties. Reuters reporters saw a person lying stiffly on the side of the road outside the entrance to an air-raid shelter, about half a mile from where the bombs fell, apparently killed by machine-gun fire. The results of the air combat are not yet known. (1st, Reuters) Chongqing: After a week of no harassment from Japanese planes due to bad weather, with strong winds and heavy rain, the weather improved last night, and Japanese planes launched another large-scale night raid on Chongqing. The first air raid alarm was issued at 8:30 PM, and citizens flocked to air-raid shelters to take cover. The first emergency alarm was issued at 9:00 PM, and the second emergency alarm was issued at 9:15 PM. The first batch of Japanese planes, totaling nine, invaded the city airspace and dropped many bombs in the south of the city. Half an hour later, the second batch of 15 planes arrived again and indiscriminately dropped bombs in the city and suburbs. The alarm was lifted at 11:00 PM. The extent of the damage has not yet been ascertained. (1st, Haitian News Agency)</p>

<h3>Chamberlain Reiterates Sincerity in Negotiations with the Soviets; Disagreement Remains Only on Definition of "Indirect Aggression"; British and French Military Representatives Depart Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the British military delegation is scheduled to leave for Paris on August 2nd, and the next day, together with the French military delegation, they will proceed to Moscow to hold talks with the Soviet General Staff. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, during today's foreign policy debate in the House of Commons, declared that the British government's decision to send a military delegation to Moscow, beginning military discussions before a political agreement is reached, is almost unprecedented in history. We agree to send representatives of the army, navy, and air force to the Soviet Union, and to discuss together how we can make our military plans correspond before we obtain a guarantee of a political agreement. This truly demonstrates the greatest trust and a genuine, intense desire to achieve a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations. The Prime Minister also said in his remarks that Britain's defenses are now remarkably strong. The main obstacle to a prompt conclusion to the Moscow talks is the failure to agree on a satisfactory definition of the term "indirect aggression." The situation in Danzig remains serious and requires attention.</p>
<p>Questions from Members of Parliament</p>
<p>Today's debate was initiated by Liberal opposition leader Sinclair, who referred to Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's recent speech in which he said, "Our current task is to resist aggression." Sinclair continued, "The leaders appointed by both opposition parties agree with this statement in equally clear, frank, and truthful terms. However, Chamberlain has not yet expressed this sentiment." (Loud shouts of "Hear, hear!" from the Conservative Party). "I must frankly state that the public has the impression that the Prime Minister's intention is still appeasement, and that his resistance to aggression is not as firm as Lord Halifax's. We urgently need new guarantees for the negotiations with the Soviet Union. The House should not adjourn now, or for an extended period, until these negotiations are concluded. The government should inform the House of the detailed progress of the negotiations as soon as possible to reassure the public. Judging from the speeches of Stalin and other Soviet politicians, and the various resolutions passed by government agencies, the Soviet Union believes that the conclusion of an agreement is beneficial to the Soviet people. Therefore, we must dispel mutual suspicions and form an alliance with the Soviet Union. To express friendship and respect, we should send someone of the highest reputation and political standing in our country, who can approach the most influential authorities in the Soviet Union, to Moscow. The events in Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Danzig all demonstrate the absolute necessity of finding a practical definition for the term "indirect aggression." The government's decision to seek recognition for the British consul in Prague, regardless of whether it de facto recognizes Germany's control over Czechoslovakia, is deeply regrettable. Fortunately, the government remains steadfast in its view and has not softened its position on Germany's demand for legal recognition of the annexation of Czechoslovakia. The situation in Czechoslovakia is very tense, and a spark there could easily ignite a prairie fire throughout Europe. As for the Danzig issue, if we want to maintain peace and stop aggression now, the government must inform the House and Germany at what point the line between peace and war will be drawn. Sinclair continued, if Hungary is unjustifiably provoked and becomes a victim of aggression, the Hungarian government is determined to defend its independence. All members of the peace front should clearly state that if other countries are willing to unite in this common interest, even Germany and Italy can do so. This would place the responsibility of encirclement on Germany's shoulders, as Lord Halifax intended. If Germany joins this circle on a completely equal footing, with disarmament, subject to the rule of law, and to the judgment of a third party, then Germany can break this encirclement at any time."</p>
<p>Labor MP Dalton declared that the opposition strongly opposes the House adjourning for an extended period with restrictions. Dalton continued to criticize the prolonged negotiations with the Soviet Union and Poland and mentioned the military talks, hoping that the members of the delegation could openly and honestly discuss matters, setting a good example for politicians. The right course today is for Lord Halifax to personally meet with Molotov, or invite Molotov to meet with him, and for Chamberlain and Stalin to exchange views, which would be admirable. If Hitler knows for sure that an alliance has been formed with Britain and France, then he will not dare to invade, at least not this year or in the near future.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's Reply</p>
<p>The Prime Minister rose to speak amid cheers, stating that he is currently in a position to guide several negotiations with foreign countries, some of which are of a delicate nature. He felt that at this moment, he should think carefully before speaking. The Prime Minister said, regarding the statement that "the Prime Minister is weaker than the Foreign Secretary," he wishes he could say one more word that would please the lurking enemies even more; otherwise, this is a malicious attempt to sow seeds of suspicion in the minds of Britain's allies. The work of handling diplomatic negotiations is not easy. He believes that those who have held responsible positions in the past and still hope to do so in the future, if they have any regard for what is appropriate and what is likely to benefit the overall situation, should ask themselves whether their conscience is clear before speaking on this matter. Since March of this year, the government has used the time to rearm, and Britain's defenses are now indeed of a great and astonishing nature. Britain, together with France, Poland, and Turkey, is consulting to build a peace front, which is of great importance. Britain will give guarantees to Romania and Greece, telling them that they are not without friends and that they are not without those who recognize that they may be the targets of attacks. If those countries are indeed attacked, then we will come to their aid. The Prime Minister continued, MP Dalton takes pride in insisting on questioning the progress of the British-Soviet negotiations. In fact, he has long been trying to blame the government for the delay in negotiations. If I restrain myself from saying this, it is precisely because I sincerely hope for a compromise. I dare to assure the House that correcting the wrong impression made by Dalton requires some self-restraint. Therefore, I intend to briefly describe the progress of the negotiations today. I am well aware that the people of other countries are watching the negotiations with envy. If they could use any tool to alienate the Soviet Union from us, they would be extremely happy. I do not want to provide them with exploitable information (Applause). The fact that the Soviet, French, and British governments have so far failed to agree on a definition of "indirect aggression" that satisfies all parties cannot be hidden. However, all three countries now know that the danger of indirect aggression is just as great as direct aggression, and all three countries are willing to find a satisfactory way to jointly resist it. At the same time, we are extremely keen to avoid any appearance of infringing on the independence of other countries. If we have not yet reached agreement with the Soviet Union on the definition of the term "indirect aggression," it is because the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, in our view, appear to have this kind of implication. Regarding the interim agreement, the Soviet Union insists that it be signed after the entire agreement is completed, and not signed in advance. The government's decision to send a military delegation to Moscow was based on the Soviet Foreign Minister's expression of opinion that once military talks begin, the political difficulties will not be insurmountable. Therefore, he attaches great importance to these military talks, which is an indication of how we are perceived. We hope that Molotov's expectations will be realized.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister next mentioned the Danzig issue, saying that the situation there continues to cause great public concern and requires careful attention. Although several border disputes have occurred, the Polish government has shown commendable restraint. Therefore, it can now be concluded that the Polish government will continue its wise and statesmanlike self-restraint. Everyone must recognize that a situation in which weapons of war continue to accumulate on all sides must be given serious attention, for if it is not resolved by war itself, it is difficult to find a way to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, countries are being incited by poisonous propaganda and harbor negative emotions towards each other. He believes that if this war of words can be ended and actions taken to restore confidence in peace among the countries of Europe, then all issues can be resolved through peaceful discussion. If this can be done, the gains for all parties involved will be immeasurable, and it can lead to an unprecedented era of prosperity for international agricultural and industrial enterprises, resulting in an improvement in the general condition of the world's people. On the other hand, if war unfortunately breaks out, then no matter who ultimately wins, both the victor and the vanquished will inevitably suffer painful lessons. He firmly believes that these great, profound, and fundamental truths have begun to permeate the minds of rulers and peoples alike. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Economic War Between Poland and Danzig</h3>
<p>Danzig: The Danzig situation, which had been calm for some time, has recently become turbulent again. It is reported that the Polish Commissioner for Danzig, Chodacki, suddenly returned from his vacation to deal with the severe trade war between Danzig and Poland. Recently, the Polish people have threatened that if Polish inspectors are not given preferential treatment in the Danzig butter factory, the Polish authorities will withdraw them. Poland has now refused to buy butter from the factory again. However, the Danzig Senate has threatened that if this decision is not reconsidered, Danzig will wage an "extensive economic war" against Poland. At the same time, German newspapers in Berlin and the German news agency claim that Poland's restrictions on the import of certain goods into Danzig are undermining the Polish-Danzig economic agreement. Reports from Poznan state that German-speaking residents there are being abused and imprisoned. The leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party, Forster, is vacationing with another Danzig leader, Zieschke, in Forster's hometown of Forster. Afterward, the two will go to Salzburg to meet with Hitler again to discuss major plans for the autumn. Observers here predict that there will be no major developments in Danzig until then. Many workers arrested in the recent anti-communist movement in Danzig have reportedly been transferred to Berlin. Several of them have been executed as political prisoners. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Warsaw: After the Polish government decided to take economic sanctions against the Free City of Danzig, the City Senate has also decided that all Polish customs officials in the city's customs must be appointed by the City Senate, and those who have not been appointed will be treated as "border" officials. In addition, it is reported that other economic retaliatory measures will be taken. The proposal to open the border between Danzig and the German province of East Prussia has not been mentioned. Government officials in Poland commented that the right to appoint and remove Danzig customs officials rests with the Polish state, and that the City Senate's actions are arbitrary and unacceptable to the Polish state. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Danzig: It is claimed here that Polish customs officials are engaged in espionage activities of all kinds, and that the number of inspectors has increased from 27 in 1929 to 100 today, which is in complete violation of the 1920 Paris Agreement. (Haitong Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Danzig: Well-informed sources here believe that the correspondence between the Danzig Senate and the Polish diplomatic representative is of the utmost importance. The main issue in the letter is Poland's ban on Danzig products entering the country. A semi-official Danzig newspaper published an article stating that if Poland wants to terminate customs and trade cooperation, then the Danzig government will have no choice but to sign new trade agreements with other neighboring countries. (Haitong Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Europe Like a Huge Barracks; British Fleet Concentrated for Exercises; German and Italian Armies Conduct Separate Large-Scale Maneuvers</h3>
<p>(London) Thirteen thousand naval reservists have arrived separately at the naval bases in Portsmouth, Gaza, Devonport, and Gosport. One hundred and thirty-three service ships will be inspected by the King at Weymouth Port before participating in naval exercises until the end of September. The cruiser "Effingham" and the 23,000-ton aircraft carrier "Courageous" are also among them. In addition, the ships belonging to the British Home Fleet have left Portsmouth for Loch Ewe and Invergordon in northern Scotland in preparation for participating in the exercises. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German army will begin large-scale maneuvers, the first in many years. Passenger planes will be banned from flying over a large area of northwestern Germany for 48 hours starting today to allow for military aircraft maneuvers during that time. Although the details of the maneuvers have not yet been announced, the restricted area is 1,500 square miles, and the scale can be imagined. After the air force exercises, they will be followed by mechanized units. These units are currently stationed in various parts of southwestern Germany, such as Silesia, Sudetenland, Bohemia, and Moravia. Their exercise range extends to the Polish border. New German recruits have been conscripted at the beginning of August, and private cars in many places have been requisitioned. The supply of gasoline for civilian use is now gradually becoming scarce. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian troops will now conduct maneuvers in the Po River region, which will be held at the same time as the German air force exercises. German Chief of Staff Halder and Hungarian Chief of Staff Wert will both come to observe. Approximately 50,000 troops will participate in the maneuvers, and their hypothetical enemy is from the French border. The exercise area is 220 miles long and 45 miles wide. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Taranto: According to a communiqué issued here today, Italian naval exercises were held in the Mediterranean Sea from July 24th to 30th, which were of great significance. All kinds of warships and submarines, as well as a large part of the air force, participated. During the final meeting of senior officers, the leader of the German delegation, Admiral Grossmann, and other senior officers from that country, as well as the leader of the Spanish delegation, Commander Rigletto, also attended the meeting. It is said that these exercises can collect a large amount of valuable information. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>25th Anniversary of the Outbreak of the European War; Germany and the Soviet Union Prepare to Commemorate</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Two million German soldiers will hold a commemoration tomorrow marking the 25th anniversary of the outbreak of the European War. Victory parades will be held throughout Germany at that time. When Kaiser Wilhelm II issued a general mobilization order on August 2, 1914, and attacked the Russian army, the number of German regular troops was less than 700,000. Today, under the rule of Chancellor Hitler's "Third Reich," there are one million regular troops, including reservists, for a total of 1.8 million. By the end of this month, the number of armed German soldiers will reach two million. Chancellor Hitler, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, has ordered the German army to hold parades and ceremonies in various places. On Wednesday, the entire day, all barracks will fly the national flag, and concerts will be held in the defense zones in the evening. Although the number of German troops today is more than double what it was when the Kaiser participated in the Great War, foreign military experts here believe that this cannot be used as a standard for comparing the strength of the German armies. In 1914, Germany had 19 classes of reservists, with a total of approximately 7.6 million trained soldiers. Today, Germany has only three classes of reservists who have received military training, with approximately one million people, in addition to the regular troops who have received full and partial training. (Associated Press Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Soviet newspapers mostly carried articles commemorating the 25th anniversary of the outbreak of the First Imperialist War. An editorial in Pravda stated, "The Second Imperialist War has now followed the First, and the war has already been waged in various parts of the world, with a great tendency to engulf the entire globe. The powerful Soviet Union has always been committed to defending peace, and those who provoke it will shatter their defenses before our country's border barriers. The Japanese militarists have already learned this lesson. The Battle of Lake Khasan has proven the solidity of Soviet national defense. The Soviet Union does not need the territory of other countries and expresses its utmost sympathy for the just resistance of other peoples and faithfully fulfills its obligations to guarantee their freedom. Therefore, the Soviet people are thoroughly implementing the Soviet-Mongolian Mutual Assistance Treaty, defending the borders and territory of the Mongolian People's Republic as if they were their own. The Soviet Union is watching the sinister games of the fascist warmongers with a calm attitude, but this calmness is different from the cowardice of the bourgeois isolationists who hide behind flimsy armor and dare not face the calamities of war. The Soviet people know that only a strong common front of peace-loving countries can stop the expansionist policies of the fascist aggressors, and only a determined and strong force is sufficient to restrain the mad aggressors. The Soviet Union's peace policy is this kind of force. We are not afraid of war and are accustomed to fighting for justice. The unity of the Soviet people and their faithful support for the government and the Leninist-Stalinist party have made the Red Army and Navy invincible. The Red Army's absolute superiority over the fascist armies is obvious." (TASS Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Hurricane Strikes Tokyo; Traffic Completely Paralyzed; 600 Houses Flooded</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo was hit by a hurricane yesterday. Six hundred houses were flooded, and some fires broke out due to electrical faults. Traffic, telecommunications, trains, and streetcars within Tokyo were all disrupted. As of midnight, at least thirty or more houses were burned due to electrical fires, but the damage was not very serious. Only one private house and a small factory were completely destroyed. All subway trains have stopped running, and business in entertainment districts has also completely stopped.</p>
<h3>British Parliament to Adjourn on the 4th, Reconvene on October 3rd, and Hold Elections in November</h3>
<p>(London) The government has drafted a motion to be submitted to Parliament for discussion, the main points of which are that October 3rd will be the date for Parliament to reconvene, but it may still be convened earlier if necessary. At the same time, an indication has been given that the House of Commons may hold elections before Christmas this year, as soon as the international situation permits. Well-informed sources say that the date of the elections will be November 16th or 13th. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Both the House of Lords and the House of Commons are scheduled to adjourn within days. According to past practice, most cabinet ministers will go abroad to spend part of their summer vacation during the summer recess. This year, except for Minister of Health Elliot, who will spend two weeks on the French Riviera in southern France, other cabinet ministers will spend their summer in their villas within the country, so that they can quickly return to Beijing if necessary. Minister for Coordination of Defence, Admiral Chatfield, will remain in Beijing until August 11th, in order to direct the blackout exercises on that day. First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Stanhope, will go to his villa in Kent to rest, or go to the Scottish coast to inspect the ships belonging to the Home Fleet. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax plans to spend time at his villa in Yorkshire. Where Prime Minister Chamberlain will go is unknown, but it can be said with certainty that he will maintain contact with Beijing. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement Spreads Throughout Japan; Cabinet Met Yesterday Morning to Discuss Maintaining Domestic Order</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, Foreign Minister Arita reported to the Cabinet on the reasons for the United States' abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and on the domestic situation in the United States. Prior to the cabinet meeting, Home Minister Kido and the Prime Minister secretly discussed maintaining domestic peace and order, as the anti-British movement is now spreading throughout the country. After the cabinet meeting, Arita reported to the Prime Minister on the progress of the Anglo-Japanese talks. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Lawyers Association has also joined the anti-British movement, passing a resolution condemning Britain's support for the Chinese government at a meeting of 400 members of the association. Today, this resolution will be sent to the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, Navy Minister, and the Japanese Ambassador to Britain. Last night, the so-called East Asia People's Association, initiated by reactionary government parties, held an anti-British mass rally. In addition to two thousand Japanese, representatives from China's "Manchukuo," Inner Mongolia, the Philippines, Annam, India, and Afghanistan also participated in the meeting. At the rally, a strongly worded anti-British resolution was passed. Anti-British rallies are also reported to have been held in Hakodate and other places. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Spain Does Not Forget Gibraltar</h3>
<p>Burgos: Today is the 235th anniversary of Spain's cession of the port of Gibraltar to Britain. The Falangist Party's newspaper "Arriba" published a long article commenting on it, stating, "Our country lost the port of Gibraltar due to the negligence of the government, for which we ourselves are also responsible. August 1, 1704, is a day of national humiliation that the Spanish people should remember. Today, all our people have great trust in the leader, General Franco, and the future is immeasurable." (Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sassoon Praises the US Abrogation of the Japan Treaty, Saying Anglo-American-French Cooperation Can Mortally Wound Japan</h3>
<p>(New York) Sir Victor Sassoon, a prominent wealthy businessman from Shanghai, told reporters here yesterday that "Japan is now coveting the lands of white people, so it is not satisfied with occupying North China. However, if the British, French, and American authorities can cooperate with each other, they can undoubtedly 'cut off Japan's throat'." He also said that the Japanese will inevitably exert pressure on South America in the future. Therefore, the United States' abrogation of the treaty with Japan is a measure to prevent future troubles. "In the future, the British government may take similar actions. As for the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo, the results may not satisfy the Japanese military." (Meiwen News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Widespread Support for US Abrogation of Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The United States government resolutely announced the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which was unanimously supported by major American newspapers, which considered it an inevitable and logical response to Japan's repeated infringement of American rights and interests in China. It is believed that the vast American public supports this action as a preliminary step to satisfy the growing demand for a boycott of Japanese goods. It is generally expected that the Japanese militarists will further aggravate the situation, and that by January next year, the US Congress will fully agree to a boycott of Japanese goods. The "New York Daily News" stated that the abrogation of the treaty is not a thorough solution and that a comprehensive strategy should be adopted, with the British and American navies using Singapore, Hawaii, and the Aleutian Islands as bases to implement a long-range blockade against Japan. The "New York Times" stated that the United States' announcement of the abrogation of the treaty at a time of serious crisis is the greatest possible pressure. It should not merely provide China with a little encouragement during a dark period. If Britain adopts a tough policy, it will not be isolated, and it warned Japan that the United States, adhering strictly to its treaty commitments, will take all peaceful means to ensure China's independence and integrity. The vast majority of the American people firmly support the government's actions. The "New York Tribune" stated that the position of the Japanese militarists will become increasingly dangerous. The "Washington Post" stated that this action by the US Executive Branch has made it clear to all countries, "including Japan," that the US government has a broad range of freedom in its foreign policy. The Philadelphia newspaper stated that the abrogation of the treaty is a step towards humanitarian goals and is sufficient to stop Japan's brutal acts of aggression, which is commendable. The "St. Louis Express" stated that the abrogation of the treaty is sufficient to restore some of Britain's failure. The "Los Angeles Times" stated that the abrogation of the treaty is an expression of ending useless paper documents and shows that Americans will not allow the situation to continue to be prolonged. French and Belgian newspapers also enthusiastically supported the US abrogation of the treaty. The French right-wing newspapers lamented that the US action was too late to prevent Britain from yielding to Japan. The right-wing "Humanité" stated that Britain and France yielded because they cited the unclear attitudes of the Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet Union's tough stance towards Japan can be seen in the border war with "Manchukuo". (31st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>An Unprecedentedly Busy Customs House: Export Goods Pile Up Like Mountains, Import of Foreign Goods Declines, Prospects are Bleak. The National Government's Effort to Balance Trade Has Achieved Significant Results. Small Machines Shift Internally</h3>
<p>The "China Mail" reports that the Jianghai Customs officers were extremely busy yesterday (the 31st), the busiest they have been in many years. They issued customs clearance documents to many exporters, mostly foreign firms shipping goods to the interior and overseas. From dawn until late at night, the Bund was unusually active. This situation is rarely seen even in this commercially thriving part of the city. Hundreds of tons of goods, packed in wooden crates or parcels, were piled up along the Bund from the Customs House to the War Memorial, waiting to be loaded onto various cargo ships leaving Shanghai this week.</p>
<p>Exporting Firms</p>
<p>Were busy all day, loading goods onto ships leaving port in the next few days, such as the "Cuff," "Marshal Joffre," and the "President Coolidge," which was being loaded today. According to investigations, the majority of goods piled up along the riverfront are being shipped to countries such as Britain and America. Customs officials claim that while there are quite a few</p>
<p>Colored Cotton Cloths</p>
<p>The majority of the goods are foodstuffs. There are also quite a few boxed mirrors and other glassware, and matches. Several small machines are waiting to be shipped, to be transported south along the coast</p>
<p>To the interior. According to a representative of a foreign export firm in this city, his firm's export business</p>
<p>To foreign countries</p>
<p>Has never been as busy as it was yesterday. Goods piled up all morning, and only began to decrease in the afternoon, indicating that many exporters had obtained customs clearance documents and were arranging to load their goods onto ships. At the same time, the volume of exports dwarfed the volume of imports. This is the first clear example of this in several months. Many believe that the</p>
<p>Trade Trend</p>
<p>Will continue like this in the coming months. Some Chinese attribute yesterday's thriving exports to the central government's efforts to balance international trade, reduce imports, and adapt to wartime conditions. The government has also strictly prohibited the import of various "enemy goods" into the interior from Shanghai. However, merchants in this city insist that Shanghai's export firms are taking advantage of the low exchange rate to buy goods cheaply and ship them abroad. Now that the value of the legal tender has been lowered, it is not surprising that imports have decreased. It is predicted that imports will continue to decline in the future.</p>
<h3>North Jiangxi Road: The Situation Eases; Residents Continue to Move Out, But Entry and Exit Are Relatively Free</h3>
<p>North Jiangxi Road, from the northern end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south to the eastern end of Old Baizi Road in the north, including shops, residences, and alleyways, suddenly became tense after the Japanese erected barriers of wooden poles and barbed wire on the 29th of last month. A Datong News Agency reporter revisited the road yesterday morning and found that the</p>
<p>Gaps in the Barricade</p>
<p>Were located at the Chongming Road intersection, the Wenjianshi Road intersection, and the Haining Road intersection. The gap at the Chongming Road intersection is used by residents traveling to and from the Hongkou area, who must present passes, pass through Japanese soldiers' posts, and bow respectfully before being allowed to pass. The gaps at the Wenjianshi Road and Haining Road intersections</p>
<p>Allow Residents To Come and Go Freely.</p>
<p>Therefore, although Japanese soldiers guard the inner perimeter of the barbed wire, residents entering and exiting do not need to bow or present passes. However, the Japanese are apparently giving the shops and residences in the blockaded area a period of hesitation in recent days, allowing them to choose whether to stay or leave. Those who</p>
<p>Choose To Leave</p>
<p>Are allowed to move. Those who choose to stay must first get a preventative shot at the street-level disease prevention office in the eastern section of North Jiangxi Road, which is in the newly blockaded area, and then obtain a pass with the vaccination certificate. Only then will they be qualified to reside there. However, based on what the Datong News Agency reporter observed, very few people seem willing to stay in the newly blockaded area. The street is full of moving trucks, and</p>
<p>Shops are Hastening To Sell</p>
<p>Goods and sundries. Homes are hurrying to move furniture and luggage to the central area of the concession, a clear indication that they are eager to avoid the situation. However, one noteworthy point observed yesterday morning was that the number of Japanese soldiers guarding the barbed wire barriers has greatly decreased. While Japanese soldiers are still stationed as inner guards at the gaps, the outer guards have been replaced by Chinese police, so the tense atmosphere has eased considerably.</p>
<h3>Busy Departure: Admiral Yarnell Returned Home Yesterday; Large Ship Scheduled to Sail to America This Morning; General Hat Scheduled to Tour the North Today</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, and his wife are scheduled to leave their residence at the Cathay Apartments at 5:00 p.m. today (the 1st), go to the Customs Wharf, and board the "President Coolidge" to return to America. Two squads of French Concession police</p>
<p>Formed an Honor Guard</p>
<p>In front of the Cathay Apartments to show respect. After Admiral Yarnell and his wife inspected the French police honor guard in front of their residence, they traveled by car, accompanied by a motorcade of the Public Concession Police and the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, via Jing'an Temple and Nanjing Road to the Customs Wharf. A squad of U.S. Marines and a band were stationed at the Customs Wharf to offer</p>
<p>Farewell Greetings</p>
<p>To Admiral Yarnell. Several groups of American expatriates in Shanghai, such as the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Community Federation, sent delegations to the Customs Wharf to bid farewell. It is expected that General Hart and his wife will also be present to bid farewell to their predecessor. The "President Coolidge" is scheduled to set sail for America at approximately 11:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 2nd). After Admiral Yarnell arrives in America, he will</p>
<p>Go to Washington</p>
<p>To report to the Chief of Naval Operations before potentially retiring. The U.S. Congress is currently considering awarding Admiral Yarnell the U.S. Medal of Honor. Furthermore, according to the "China Mail," after bidding farewell to the outgoing Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, General Hart, is scheduled to travel to Qingdao aboard the U.S. warship "Augusta" at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow (the 2nd). This voyage is</p>
<p>The First Voyage</p>
<p>Under the new Commander-in-Chief, to sail to North China to join the rest of the Asiatic Fleet for summer exercises. General Hart's wife and two daughters are scheduled to leave Shanghai aboard the "Dalian Maru" tomorrow morning and will meet General Hart in Qingdao. The U.S. transport ship "Gold Star" has been berthed in Shanghai for a week and is scheduled to sail to Japan at 9:30 a.m. today (the 1st). The "Gold Star's" domestic base is Guam in the Pacific Ocean, and it</p>
<p>Sails North Annually</p>
<p>Three times a year to purchase food and other goods and supply the residents of the island. This time, it arrived in Shanghai at the end of its voyage north, carrying several officers and soldiers stationed in Guam and their families, who toured the north for a week to temporarily escape the heat of the tropical island.</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppet Authorities Promote "Huaxing" Counterfeit Currency; Rumor That Customs Authorities Are Considering It; Puppet "Renovation Government" Forces Its Use</h3>
<p>According to the "New Voice News Agency," after the fall of Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs was the first target of the "Renovation Government," which seized all tax revenues, forced them to be deposited into the Zhengjin Bank, and forced the Jianghai Customs to fly the five-colored flag on its roof. It was previously rumored that the "Renovation Government" ordered the Jianghai Customs to collect "Huaxing banknotes" for tax revenues within the Japanese-controlled areas. It is rumored that the Jianghai Customs authorities are currently considering this. It is also said that the Jianghai Customs has not received such an order.</p>
<p>Japanese Employees Paid With Counterfeit Currency</p>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily," the Japanese authorities have decided to promote the circulation of "Huaxing Commercial Bank" banknotes in this city. This can be inferred from reliable sources. Broadway Mansion announced at the end of last month that it would require rent to be paid in the new counterfeit currency from September 1st. It is also said that Japanese trading firms will allow all employees, especially Chinese employees, to be paid with this "Hongkou currency" soon.</p>
<p>Forced Use in the Central China Area</p>
<p>It is also said that all factories and other commercial establishments in the "Great Way" area will be requested to use this currency to pay their employees. Yesterday (the 31st), Reuters reported from Tokyo that "semi-official Japanese sources in Nanjing" claimed that all taxes and customs duties in Central China would be required to be paid in the new "Huaxing currency" in the future. The "Renovation Government," which controls the new bank, has issued this order.</p>
<p>Mellor's Statement: No News</p>
<p>When the reporter asked Jianghai Customs Commissioner Mellor about this matter yesterday, he replied, "All I can say is that I have no official news." Yesterday, when Japanese officials hosted a press conference, reporters asked about the Tokyo news mentioned above. The spokesperson replied that the Chinese Customs authorities and the "Renovation Government" were "studying ways to collect customs duties in a currency that is slightly more stable than the legal tender." The matter is still under study. According to the "China Mail," just after 9:00 p.m. on Sunday night, a patrol team from the Pudong Road Police Station ordered two Chinese men to stop on Robert Yinghua Alley (transliterated). However, the two men refused to be searched, claiming that they were detectives from the "Great Way" Police Bureau. However, the police officers leading the patrol team pointed out that they were stopped within the Public Concession. The two sides were at odds, and a crowd of Chinese onlookers gathered. After a long time, it was decided to take the two men to the police station for verification. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday (the 30th), evidence was obtained proving that the two men were indeed employed by the "Great Way" Police Bureau, and they were released. The police station is taking this matter seriously because "Great Way" police officers have no right to enter the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Escaping the Summer Heat in Qingdao Bitterly Describe Their Ordeals; Japanese Women Search British Women and Seize Legal Tender; Total Amount Seized On One Ship Estimated at 5,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," foreigners returning to Shanghai after escaping the summer heat in Qingdao and the Japanese authorities in Qingdao are strictly searching departing passengers, including foreigners traveling to escape the summer heat, and seizing any legal tender found. The searches of British passengers are particularly strict, but foreigners of other nationalities are not exempt. The Japanese who conduct searches on departing ships treat passengers like prisoners. A foreign woman from Shanghai who returned from Qingdao on the "Dalian Maru"</p>
<p>Said that</p>
<p>She was led into an empty cabin by a Japanese searcher and subjected to a thorough search. Although she was not stripped naked, she was forced to lift her underwear, and several hundred yuan of legal tender hidden inside were immediately seized. She was given a receipt. She even wanted to keep two yuan for a taxi fare, but was not allowed to. When passengers boarded the ship on Sunday,</p>
<p>The Examiners Were Arranged on the Deck</p>
<p>There were no fewer than seven examiners, and one Japanese woman stood at the other end. Passengers were searched without exception as they passed. The Shanghai foreign woman was carrying a small suitcase, which was searched one by one by seven examiners. When they opened her handbag, which contained Federal Reserve notes, they were not confiscated. When she reached the other end, the Japanese woman examiner stopped her, groped her body, and asked the foreign woman to step out of the line.</p>
<p>And Lift Her Underwear. The foreign woman protested. The Japanese woman consulted with other examiners, led her into an empty cabin, conducted a more thorough search, and confiscated the legal tender that was found. According to the foreign woman's estimate, no less than 5,000 yuan of legal tender was seized on the ship that day. Passengers had received notice before boarding that legal tender was not allowed to be brought back to Shanghai. Some British passengers were searched as many as four times before the examiners.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Industry Peers Reorganize Business Rules; Set Dates for Silver Exchange in This City and Other Ports; All Businesses to Operate as Usual From Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Guild's affiliated trade groups are reorganizing business rules in order to maintain peer operations. They suspended business for three days starting on the 29th of last month. It is now learned that all peers in the industry have revised their business rules as follows: (1) Silver Exchange Period: Within this city, silver exchange is stipulated to occur twice a month, i.e., from the 1st to the 15th of each month, exchange is to be completed with 20-day promissory notes; from the 16th to the end of the month, exchange is to be completed with 5-day promissory notes for the following month. (2) Other Ports: Regardless of face-to-face consultation or written orders, silver must be paid before goods are delivered. (3) Customer's Helper Weighing: After the transaction is completed, weighing must be completed within three days. If the deadline is exceeded, the business will weigh on behalf of the customer, send the invoice for stamping, and silver must be exchanged on time. If there is a delay, the customer will be responsible for any accidents. The above rules have been unanimously approved by the industry and will be implemented from August 1st. All businesses have resumed normal operations today.</p>

<h3>The French Concession Newspaper District: Precautions Become Increasingly Thorough; Opening and Closing of the Grain Exchange is Restricted; Terrorists Cannot Act</h3>
<p>Since the attack on the Zhongmei Ribao and Da Wanbao newspapers, the French Concession authorities, because the Da Mei newspaper is located in the French Concession area at No. 19 Edward Road, the police authorities, fearing accidents, have implemented strict precautions in the area where the newspaper is located. Four small armored vehicles have been stationed day and night from the Bund to the Zhubao San Road intersection, and armed French troops, as well as Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives, are patrolling back and forth. In addition, plainclothes detectives are inspecting suspicious pedestrians at any time in the Huangpu Beach Road Catholic Church Street area.</p>
<p>Opening and Closing of the Grain Exchange is Restricted</p>
<p>Because the Grain Exchange at No. 15 Edward Road is next door to the Da Mei newspaper and the exchange is a commercial market, the situation is very complicated. The Laobeimen Maixie Police Station in the French Concession fears that lawless elements will mix among them and attempt to disrupt public order. Therefore, it notified the exchange the other day to stipulate business hours: the door opens at 8:00 a.m. every day, closes at 11:45 a.m., opens at 1:30 p.m., and closes at 6:00 p.m. The keys to the iron gate are taken away by the police detectives on duty and then the doors are locked. No one is allowed to enter or leave. Now that the exchange has received this notice, it has announced it to the market and issued entry cards for identification purposes, otherwise entry is not allowed.</p>
<p>Exchange Staff's Family Members and Others Request Understanding and Change</p>
<p>Approximately one hundred members of the Shanghai Grain Exchange and their family members stayed in the exchange after the "August 13th" incident. Now that the French Concession police authorities have suddenly implemented emergency precautionary measures at the exchange, causing panic among all the staff members and their families living there. They specifically requested the police authorities and the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association today to change the opening and closing times from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. every morning, with no closure at noon, and further requested that each member of the exchange board be issued an entry and exit permit.</p>
<p>The French Police Station is Doing Its Utmost to Protect the Newspaper District</p>
<p>One day, the French newspaper Shanghai Ribao said that yesterday morning, some people passing by Edward Road suspected that a new incident had occurred there, because two automatic gun vehicles were deployed in the Da Mei Wanbao newspaper area near Catholic Church Street, and two Western police officers each held light machine guns and patrolled non-stop, while in the middle of the road, both Chinese and Western police officers had pistols to check pedestrians. On the sidewalk opposite the Da Mei Wanbao, there were two small bunkers, each guarded by one Chinese police officer. It is said that this strict precaution is because of the radicalism of the intimidation movement, and the police station is doing its utmost to protect the Da Mei Wanbao, because the newspaper has received many threatening letters, and the confession of the thugs arrested ten days ago has revealed a large-scale conspiracy. Although newspapers in other places may be subjected to new attacks, in the Da Mei Wanbao in the French Concession, terrorists cannot act. Moreover, it is said that the precautions of the French police station are not limited to the French Concession, and its patrolmen can also reach the other side of the Public Concession, and the Public Concession patrolmen are the same. This shows the practical cooperation between the two concession authorities, and although there are many bandits, it is feared that it will be difficult to take action. We still remember that when the Da Wanbao was attacked by bandits the previous week, the French Concession was the first to respond with gunfire, and the firepower was also fiercer from the French Concession.</p>
<p>The French Police Station Searched Wanyi Fang Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>At 5:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the French Concession Police Department dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in several police vehicles to surround Wanyi Fang on Luban Road, and then searched door to door. The search lasted for one hour. As a result, nothing was found.</p>
<h3>Haitan Sailing to Fuzhou Accidentally Touches Japanese Underwater Mine; Fortunately, Emergency Methods Were Used to Return to Hong Kong; Ships Sailing to Shacheng Are Obstructed From Unloading</h3>
<p>The British-owned Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Haitan ship sailed from Hong Kong to Fuzhou on July 25th. At about 8:00 p.m. on the 26th, when it sailed north of Xiamen, near the sea off Fuzhou, it accidentally touched a Japanese naval mine blocking the Fuzhou port. The No. 1 cabin was broken. Fortunately, the shipowner managed to seal the broken area with emergency methods and had to return to Hong Kong. It arrived safely in Hong Kong the other day. It is reported that the mine was touched at 120 degrees east longitude and 26 degrees north latitude, that is, outside the mouth of the Minjiang River.</p>
<p>Shenguang Sailing to Wenzhou Has Already Returned</p>
<p>The routes of ships owned by the British Yilong Company have always been Wenzhou, Xinghua, Quanzhou, Shacheng, and Fuzhou. Since the ports along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian have been blockaded by Japanese warships, they have been forced to temporarily anchor and suspend sailing. The other day, the Shenguang ship was sent from Shanghai with an empty ship to test the Wenzhou route. When it reached the mouth of Wenzhou, it could not enter because Japanese warships had placed underwater mines outside the mouth of the Oujiang River. It returned to Shanghai. According to the Shanghai company's news yesterday, the ship will arrive in Shanghai in about three days, so the resumption of navigation to Wenzhou is difficult to achieve in the short term.</p>
<p>Ninghai Arrives in Hong Kong, Shacheng Suspends Navigation</p>
<p>Since Japanese warships obstructed navigation on the Fujian Shacheng route, the British-owned Lihe Foreign Firm's Haifu ship was obstructed from unloading when it arrived outside the mouth of Shacheng. Therefore, the plan to sail from Shanghai to Shacheng was terminated. The British-owned Taikoo Company's Ninghai ship sailed from Shacheng to Hong Kong. It was rumored that it was detained by Japanese warships in the Fujian waters. It has now been confirmed that the ship was questioned by Japanese warships using flag signals on its way from Shacheng to Hong Kong, but it was not inspected or detained. It has now arrived safely in Hong Kong. At present, no ships from Taikoo, Yilong, and other companies are sailing to Shacheng.</p>
<p>Jiangsu to Test the Waters in Xinghua and Quanzhou</p>
<p>British shipping companies are trying to maintain navigation to ports such as Shantou, which have been suspended due to the Japanese naval blockade of China's coastal shipping lanes. Although repeatedly obstructed by the Japanese, the Nanyang-class ships are still testing the waters. Now, the Taikoo Company has scheduled the Jiangsu ship to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 4th, deciding to test the waters in Xinghua and Quanzhou. It is said that this decision to test the waters is experimental in nature, so it is difficult to predict whether there will be any problems. The company has decided to use barges to transport passengers and cargo to the wharf.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Afternoon, the Huangpu River Tide Was High</h3>
<p>The new Pacific hurricane reached 26 degrees north latitude and 136 degrees east longitude within a range of 120 nautical miles at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. According to the above-mentioned position, it is in the middle of the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese-owned Ogasawara Islands. The wind direction is northeast-east, so Shanghai is unlikely to be attacked. According to the observatory's report at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, a new hurricane was also brewing in the southern part of the Pacific Ryukyu Islands, at 24 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude within a range of 60 nautical miles. Because it is in a static state, its trend is unknown. However, this hurricane is very strong, and the atmospheric pressure along the Japanese coast and the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is also showing a similar decline, so its trend and development are worthy of attention. As for the climate in this city, it was quite hot yesterday. According to the observatory's records, the highest temperature before 3:00 p.m. reached 91.5 degrees, and the lowest temperature was 76.8 degrees. The weather was clear all day. In addition, the tide in the Huangpu River was quite high at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The tide water seeped out of the low-lying roads and sewers. There will still be high tides today, and it will not return to normal until the 5th.</p>
<h3>Autumn Cocoon Problem Not Resolved; Silk Factories' Future is Pessimistic; Merchants Who Sold Futures Agree to Postpone Delivery; Factories Suffer Losses Due to Japanese Obstruction</h3>
<p>Silk factories in the concession were forced to shut down earlier because raw materials were exhausted. They originally intended to start work immediately after the spring cocoons were on the market. However, because the cocoons that the factories received from the occupied areas were illegally obstructed by the "China Silk Company," they were delayed in resuming work. Now the problem of shipping spring cocoons to Shanghai has been resolved. More than 40 factories in the concession, such as Lianyuan, Fulong, Yuexing, Hualun, Shanghai, and Hongfeng, have successively resumed silk reeling. However, the losses due to the obstruction of spring cocoons to Shanghai are not small.</p>
<p>Selling Futures Postpones Delivery</p>
<p>Although the factories have resumed work, there are not many raw materials. It is expected that after October, they may shut down again due to the exhaustion of raw materials. The problem of buying Qian cocoons has not yet been resolved, so the future of silk factories is quite pessimistic. As for the spring cocoon futures that the factories sold earlier, the factories and the foreign firms that were engaged in exports have agreed to postpone delivery. Before the autumn cocoon problem is resolved, the sale of futures will be temporarily suspended. Also, the shipment of spring cocoons from eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai has not yet materialized.</p>
<p>Exports Increased Sharply, Silk Prices Rose Slightly</p>
<p>The exports of Chinese silk in the first half of this year were: (1) white silk 167,827 kilograms, worth 1,457,000 yuan, (2) white silk 268,285 kilograms, worth 3,461,000 yuan, (3) white filature silk 937,269 kilograms, worth 20,547,000 yuan, (4) yellow filature silk, yellow silk 315,074 kilograms, worth 2,576,000 yuan, (5) waste silk 1,178,874 kilograms, worth 2,596,000 yuan, (6) gray silk, palace silk, etc., 126,325 kilograms, worth 1,000,000 yuan. Chinese silk exports have increased sharply compared to last year. The price has risen to 3,200 yuan per picul.</p>
<h3>Save Money on the Ullambana Festival to Help Refugees: Mr. Jin Zongcheng's Proposal</h3>
<p>Mr. Jin Zongcheng, chairman of the Xin Xin Company, said that the seventh month of the lunar calendar is approaching, and it is customary to hold the Ullambana Festival, which wastes a lot of money. It is better to propose helping the refugees. His intention is very important. Mr. Jin told a visitor yesterday that there are two important problems in Shanghai: one is that prices are rising and life is becoming more difficult, and the other is that diseases are increasing in the hot summer weather. The most painful thing about these two problems is that they are sleeping on the streets</p>
<p>Poor and Have Nowhere to Go</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the number of refugees who have been displaced by the war is countless. The suffering they have suffered from being displaced, homeless, and without food is the most tragic thing in the world. In Shanghai alone, there are hundreds of thousands of refugees, some of whom are temporarily accommodated in shelters and provided with food, which barely solves the problem of clothing, food, and medical care. However, the general public who sleep on the streets, who are poor and have nowhere to go, after the shortage of auxiliary coins in the market, it is very difficult to beg for money, and now they have to suffer from rising prices and summer diseases, which makes them feel more like they are in</p>
<p>Deep Water and Scorching Heat.</p>
<p>Human beings have an innate sense of compassion, and when they see the plight of these refugees, everyone will inevitably feel compassion. Because the seventh month of the lunar calendar is approaching, the citizens of Shanghai have always had a habit of initiating the Ullambana Festival to help the ghosts in the underworld, which can also be regarded as a charitable undertaking. The cost of a month is really considerable. However, helping the ghosts in the underworld cannot be seen, and helping these refugees can be seen with one's own eyes. At the present time, of course, we must first take care of what we see with our own eyes, and saving the living</p>
<p>Is More Important Than Saving the Dead.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A penny does not fall into empty space." It is the same as helping, and it is the same as accumulating virtue in secret. If you help refugees, it is called "Heaven has the virtue of good life in the streets." This kind of merit is even greater. I hope that the charitable citizens of Shanghai will pay more attention. Saving people is saving yourself. Everyone should quickly use the money from the Ullambana Festival to help the refugees.</p>
<h3>The Bank of China Issues the Second Installment of Construction Bonds Yesterday; Bond Amount is 30 Million National Currency; Repayment to be Completed Over 25 Years Starting in the 30th Year of the Republic</h3>
<p>In order to carry out construction matters, the National Government ordered the Chongqing General Office of the Central Bank to issue 28-year construction bonds, with a total amount of 60 million yuan, divided into two installments, each with 30 million yuan. The first installment was issued and completed on April 1. The second installment was also issued at face value yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Second Installment of Construction Bonds Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>The total amount of the second installment of construction bonds is still 30 million yuan, and it was officially issued by the Chongqing General Office of the Bank of China yesterday. The annual interest rate is set at six percent. The repayment method is scheduled to start repaying the principal from January 31 of the 30th year of the Republic and be fully repaid in 25 years. The purpose of issuing these bonds is based on the central government's designation of completed construction and newly established national enterprises, as well as all other construction matters. The large sum of money obtained from the issuance of these bonds is intended to be combined with the special funds for construction projects levied under the salt tax item to form a construction fund. The bond custodian is responsible for the management committee of the national debt fund. The repayment agencies are designated as the Bank of China and other entrusted banks.</p>
<p>Chongqing General Office Responsible for Handling</p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the Bank of China yesterday, since the Shanghai war, the head office of the bank moved to Chongqing long ago. All issuance and repayment procedures for public bonds are handled entirely by the head office. The Shanghai branch is only a communication agency. Moreover, China's asset class flocked to the mainland before the war. The head offices of other private banks have also moved to the mainland. Most people are contacting the head office for the purchase of this second phase of bonds. The Shanghai branch has not received any instructions from the head office to handle such bond matters, neither before nor after. As for the types of face value of the bonds issued, it is estimated to be the same as ordinary bonds. The rumors about the Shanghai branch handling the matter are completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Auxiliary Coinage to be Shipped to Shanghai Regularly</h3>
<p>Totaling 500,000</p>
<p>After the severe shortage of copper coins in the Shanghai market in mid-month, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting a quick solution. The Ministry of Finance ordered the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank to issue one-cent, five-cent, and fractional currency notes, and ordered the Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture Banks to transport auxiliary currency notes to Shanghai for relief. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that a large number of one-dime and two-dime auxiliary currency notes from the Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture Banks have already arrived in Shanghai and are being distributed in the market by the four banks. The one-cent, five-cent, and fractional currency notes are printed by the Yongning Company in Hong Kong, totaling 300,000 yuan for one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan for five-cent notes. They are expected to be delivered by Hong Kong in mid-August and shipped to Shanghai for distribution by the Central Bank. As for the casting of lead coins, it is being discussed between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Foreign and Chinese Employees Given Free Passes</h3>
<p>According to police station news, the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps in Hongkou has officially announced that Chinese employees hired by foreigners who wish to go north of the Suzhou Creek can request a free pass. The previous report that each pass would cost two-and-a-half cents has been cancelled.</p>

<h3>Why Does a Love Vow Suddenly Vanish Like a Flash in the Pan?</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Nan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>Those who cannot fully develop their rationality, but instead indulge in fantasies and are moved by emotions, are bound to misguide the future of young men and women, and this must be attributed to the doctrine of free love. We have no objection to the saying that love is an element of marriage. However, it is a prejudice to regard marriage as an essential condition for the establishment of love. There are not a few who create love after marriage. On the contrary, there are many young people who, when the heat of love is too high, disregard everything and make vows of love, but how long does it take for them to become enemies like fire and water, incompatible with each other, and their love disappears like a flash in the pan? What is the reason for this? In a word, this is entirely due to the disintegration of sexual function, which cannot bear the difficult work of reproduction. Because in the love of men and women, no more than 30% comes from the fusion of spirits, and 70% comes from carnal desire. Therefore, if men and women do not have sexual life as a medium, they will never be able to complete the whole story. Young people who value love often masturbate before talking about love. Their sexual function is damaged by masturbation. Once they enter into a real married life, it is difficult to cheer up, and their love history will be like a flash in the pan, and heartbreak is inevitable. In the old-fashioned marriage, people get married based only on the words of matchmakers and the orders of parents. There are many who have a fulfilling love life after marriage. This is probably because their reproductive power stabilizes their foundation. Therefore, rather than taking love, which is prone to change and uncertainty, as an essential element of marriage, it is better to take healthy energy and strong reproductive power as essential elements of marriage. If this can be used as a standard, then the love of husband and wife can be maintained permanently. However, the above conditions should be possessed by every man. Do not be promiscuous before marriage, and masturbation should be strictly prohibited. Those who have seminal emission should seek treatment immediately. Those who feel kidney deficiency should not seek unreasonable treatment. According to my many years of experience in treating this disease, using the genuine German testicular endocrine preparation "Body-Con" for men can fully enhance their reproductive function, promote metabolism, and treat premature aging and nocturnal emission, like a wind sweeping away fallen leaves, with a miraculous effect. Excessive sexual intercourse and other abuse of semen, such as masturbation, cause the internal secretion fluid produced by the testicles to fall short of demand, not only causing impotence, but also lacking this type of secretion fluid in the blood, which greatly affects the health of the body. Therefore, using the testicular essence preparation "Body-Con" for men to treat the above symptoms has special effects.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>How to Improve Memory</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Anyone who establishes a great career must have extraordinary brainpower. Those who are quick-witted and have a strong memory can always gain the upper hand. For example, students and business people who hold calculations and calculate, their achievements and chances of success will naturally be superior. However, this is not a gift that ordinary people often get, so success belongs to the minority. This is the old concept of the past. Now, thanks to scientific progress, this kind of riddle has begun to be explained. What people used to think was endowed by a few people can now be transformed by human power. It is estimated that the memory in the brain is generally above the horizontal line, and most of those who fall below the horizontal line are those who abuse masturbation or indulge in early marriage during the developmental period, which greatly hinders the development of the youth glands. And memory is also becoming weaker day by day. Often what happened yesterday is like a past life, and the books that are recited cannot be memorized even if they are occupied all day long due to the weakness of memory. As a result, the spirit becomes more and more depressed, and the career becomes more and more unsuccessful. The dreary life becomes more and more boring, and there is always a desire to commit suicide.</p>
<p>However, there is now a scientific method to solve the biggest regret in life. Patients who suffer from poor memory, lack of memory, and lack of judgment can all take "Body-Con" invented by Dr. Mellen of Germany. This medicine can help the development of youth glands and increase the cell power of memory in the brain. And make the muscles delicate, white and elastic. Strong memory and abundant muscles are only available in youth, and most young people are ruined by masturbation and excessive sexual activity during the developmental period. As a result, like a tender bud that has just emerged, it is destroyed by wind and storms, and it will naturally wither and fall, so there is a sign of premature aging. However, if you take "Body-Con", it is like a long drought meeting sweet rain, and the millet valley returns to spring. Not only will your memory increase, but you will also regain the youthful and lively appearance. If students who study hard and business people who hold calculations and calculate, and therefore have poor memory, take "Body-Con", the effect is unparalleled.</p>
<h3>Too Much Phlegm Prevents Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>People with a lot of phlegm must feel difficulty in breathing and act anxiously. The phlegm is thick and sticky, either white or yellow, thin or thick, and often has many black lumps in the morning. During the cough, it is easy to develop pneumonia, so it is necessary to treat and remedy it urgently. People with healthy lungs must have less phlegm, and those with lung disease must have more phlegm. According to the principles of medicine, eliminating cough and phlegm requires supplementing the lungs as a prerequisite—and "Lung Supplementing Nal" is indeed an effective preparation for relieving cough and expectorant. Its efficacy surpasses cod liver oil, and after taking "Lung Supplementing Nal", those who have not yet developed tuberculosis can prevent pulmonary tuberculosis, and those who have already developed tuberculosis can completely cure stage 1, 2, and 3 lung diseases, such as hemoptysis and night sweats. Symptoms such as asthma are all targeted, and major hospitals and experts around the world regard this medicine as a special medicine for lung diseases.</p>
<h3>Case of Cured Spermatorrhea: Unsuccessful Love Leads to Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Patient Dong Youlin, from Xiamen, Fujian, 22 years old (self-reported). Last spring, he fell in love with a girlfriend, but later, due to disagreements among the parents, he could not get his wish. Since then, every time he was drowsy in his sleep, all the illusions would surge up and become nocturnal emission, which gradually increased, so he came to me for treatment (treatment process). He was ordered to recuperate, engage in noble entertainment, rub the local area with cold water before going to bed, and take three tablets of "Nes Spermatorrhea Tablets". Mr. Dong followed my words, and after two months, no seminal emission occurred.</p>
<h3>Early Damage Leads to Impotence After Marriage</h3>
<p>Patient Shi Weikang, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, 25 years old, (self-reported). In his early years, he liked to read erotic books, and was also seduced by his companions, often playing with his sexual organs to enjoy ejaculation. Later, he often had seminal emission, but he did not pay much attention to it. He got married at the age of 23, but could not last long in sexual intercourse, only half a minute, and his sexual organs were as short as a child's. For the sake of happiness, he came to seek treatment. (Treatment process) He received daily electrotherapy, took "Nes Spermatorrhea Tablets" to consolidate his sperm gate, and also took "Body-Con" to treat his premature ejaculation and phlegm. He was cured in about three months.</p>
<p>Trivia on Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>The Pain of Gonorrheal Arthritis</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road. Gonorrhea leading to arthritis means that the person has lost the chance to recover quickly and has transformed into a systemic infection of gonorrhea. Although there are many causes, to get to the bottom of it, it is nothing more than gonorrhea patients who delay treatment and whose remaining toxins attack internally. Moreover, due to the stimulation of alcohol and sexual activity, these cunning gonococci spread throughout the body through blood circulation. If gonococci remain in the joints, arthritis will result. The patient experiences alternating chills and fever, joint swelling, sudden severe pain, and a state of tension and fluctuation, fatigue, and loss of appetite. At this point, the scope of the gonococci is expanding day by day, so it is unpredictable and cannot be treated by general local surgery or transmembrane bactericidal agents.</p>
<p>Since there are many such gonococci entrenched and causing trouble in the whole body's joints, it is impossible to remove them one branch at a time. A fundamental solution must be made by taking the overall situation into consideration. Therefore, it is necessary to give the whole body cells the effect of resisting lymph-phagocytic bacteria. Since the virus is so pervasive throughout the body, how can local surgical treatment be used to seek efficacy? Now there is a scientific method to solve this matter. That is, German X-ray electrotherapy and static electrotherapy are used alternately in physical therapy. On the one hand, German anti-gonorrheal blood serum and the special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinong" are taken internally, which can immediately reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and reduce swelling. Because after taking "Kelinong", anti-lymph-phagocytic bacteria will be produced in a short period of time. On the one hand, it helps anti-gonorrheal blood serum, and static X-electrotherapy can further exert the special great effect of "Kelinong" in killing bacteria. Therefore, the gonococci hidden in the deep part of the joints are completely eliminated, and on the other hand, the effects of anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antiseptic are obtained. Therefore, if the joint swelling and pain are not suppurated internally, taking "Kelinong" can be insured against prevention and eliminate it and restore it to its original state. Consultation hours...10 am to 6 pm. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen every day, and each patient will only be charged 5 jiao for the number and will be given a free copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth 1 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Public Works Department's Security Committee Discusses Traffic Management Issues; Strengthens Crackdown on Illegal Speeding of Bicycles; Car Drivers Driving Too Fast Should be Held Accountable</h3>
<p>When the Security Committee of the Public Works Department held a meeting on the 20th of last month, it discussed many motions on traffic matters. At that time, the opinions of the Chinese Automobile Association were provided for the reference of the committee members, and the Westerner Lederer attended the meeting to express his opinions. Mr. Lederer had already given a speech on traffic management matters at the last annual meeting of foreign taxpayers. The summary of his speech was also reviewed by the committee members. The results of the discussion are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Illegal Bicycles</p>
<p>The Chinese Automobile Association has investigated bicycles on the streets and found that they often speed recklessly, causing many dangers. It is imperative to strictly crack down on them. Regarding this matter, the committee members of the Security Committee now know that the police department of the bureau has taken strict measures. On average, 527 bicycle riders are prosecuted every month. The police department also sends warnings and propaganda materials on road safety to bicycle riders and bicycle shops one after another. At that time, someone in the meeting advocated that those who did not follow the rules or obeyed the command of the police should be severely punished, such as detention. However, the chief of the police department believed that it was not appropriate to implement detention. The current method adopted by the police for these people is to pry off their licenses. Afterwards, the car owner pays a fine to the court. The chief of the police department also said that bicycles are a common means of transportation, and the number of violations will inevitably increase day by day. The committee members immediately resolved to request the bureau to instruct the police department to strengthen the crackdown on bicycle riders who violate traffic regulations and do not obey the command of the police.</p>
<p>Parking Problem on Haig Road</p>
<p>The Chinese Automobile Association also stated that parking should be prohibited on the south side of Haig Road, near the Western Girls' School and the German General Assembly Hall, in order to reduce danger. The police department said that this matter should be considered by the police department of the French Concession. The section proposed by the association has been forwarded for verification.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Excessive Car Speed</p>
<p>Trucks and taxis often drive too fast in busy sections of the concession, such as Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, especially when they are empty. The Chinese Automobile Association believes that excessive speed is particularly dangerous and should be cracked down on, and suggests that special attention be paid by the motorcycle patrol team. According to the report of the chief of the police department, the department has ordered patrol officers to strengthen their monitoring of this matter. As a result, a total of 127 drivers were prosecuted last month. The committee members stated that the patrol and prosecution of the police department should be effective.</p>
<p>Problem of Cars Overtaking Front Cars</p>
<p>The Chinese Automobile Association also put forward an opinion, saying that cars often overtake other vehicles that are proceeding in the same direction or waiting for traffic lights on Avenue Edward VII, especially during the busy hours at noon. Recently, there have been more and more heavy trucks in the area, so the vehicles are moving very slowly. Cars with lower horsepower cannot overtake trucks, which makes the vehicles even more congested. As a result, cars with higher speeds often disregard the current traffic regulations when driving forward, overtaking vehicles in front and trying to pass through slow-moving trucks. To remedy this, it is proposed that the Public Works Department draw two white boundary lines on the road surface of Avenue Edward VII. Heavy trucks are only allowed to travel within the left-hand boundary line, so that fast-moving vehicles can overtake the vehicles in front between the two lines. This method can have a psychological impact on drivers. It has long been adopted in European and American countries. The police department believes that the width of the road on Avenue Edward VII is insufficient, and overtaking is prone to danger and violates the prohibition. The above suggestions are sufficient to encourage drivers to drive illegally and are prone to collisions with oncoming vehicles. The police officers stationed on Avenue Edward VII have been ordered to pay attention to overtaking. The committee members agreed with the points made by the police department. Someone in the meeting also argued that too much land was being wasted on both sides of Avenue Edward VII. The departments in charge of the Public Works Department should find ways to move all the platforms on the road closer to the side stones, so as to widen the road surface available for fast-moving vehicles. The Public Works Department continued to say that if all the platforms could be removed, the traffic could be greatly improved. However, the purpose of installing the platforms is to divide slow-moving and fast-moving vehicles, and to allow vehicles to park between the two platforms. If the road surface used by fast-moving vehicles is widened, it is doubtful whether there will still be enough space to park vehicles and drive slow-moving vehicles. Moreover, there are many collapsed cars passing through Avenue Edward VII, so attention must be paid to them. Any changes to the road administration of Avenue Edward VII must be approved by the French Concession.</p>
<p>Improve the Road Surface of the Racecourse Road</p>
<p>The road surface on both sides of the Racecourse Road is slightly rough and uneven. Therefore, most collapsed cars, rickshaws, and bicycles travel in the center of the road. The Chinese Automobile Association believes that this situation is contrary to the intention of widening the Racecourse Road and should be improved. It is also suggested that three traffic boundary lines be drawn on the road surface. Regarding this matter, the police department has submitted a report, stating that measures to restrict slow-moving vehicles on the Racecourse Road and other roads have been implemented. The Public Works Department has been asked to pay attention to the problem of uneven road surfaces. The road surface on both sides of the Racecourse Road is indeed uneven and prone to danger, so all vehicles are not allowed to overtake the vehicles in front. The chief of the Public Works Department once said that when the Racecourse Road was built, due to the lack of materials and the desire to save money, the road surface on both sides was built with old materials, so it could not be as flat as the central part of the road. However, trolleybuses will soon be running on this road, and at that time, the road surface on both sides will have to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Advocate for Collapsed Cars to Install Rubber Wheels</p>
<p>The Chinese Automobile Association also proposes that the authorities of the two concessions notify all collapsed cars and rickshaws to install rubber tires and stipulate that from a certain date (presumably January 1 of next year), all collapsed cars with iron wheels will not be allowed to obtain licenses. The chief of the police department reported that the replacement of iron wheels on collapsed cars with rubber wheels is in progress. The committee members also reported that the Public Works Department, in view of the fact that collapsed cars with iron wheels easily damage the road surface, had repeatedly discussed the issue of replacing them with rubber wheels in the past few years, and decided that in order to encourage car owners, those collapsed cars that have been retrofitted with rubber wheels would be allowed to be exempted from half of the license fee from July 1, 1937. When the board of directors of the Public Works Department passed this motion, it made it clear that the bureau was unwilling to take mandatory measures regarding the retrofitting of wheels on collapsed cars. In December last year, in order to further encourage it, the Public Works Department revised the license fee table for collapsed cars, allowing these vehicles that have been fitted with rubber wheels to carry more goods than those of the same grade that have not been fitted with rubber wheels, which will be implemented from July 1 of this year. Regarding this matter, the Security Committee still advocates not taking mandatory measures. (End of Section 1)</p>
<h3>The Taikoo Steamer Jiangsu Anchors Outside the Port for Quarantine</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Steamship Company's South China liner Jiangsu, which was scheduled to come to Shanghai from Hong Kong via Xiamen, had a fireman die on board en route. The ship telegraphed the Shanghai office and reported it to the Customs Quarantine Office, requesting an inspection. Therefore, after arriving at the mouth of Wusong yesterday afternoon, it anchored outside the port to wait for inspection. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but it did not enter the port. Whether it can come to Shanghai today depends on the completion of the quarantine procedures before it can enter the port. The company has already decided that the ship will sail from Shanghai to Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Haiphong in Guangzhou Bay today, and now it has been changed to tomorrow. If it still does not enter the port today, the South China trip tomorrow will be postponed again.</p>

<h3>An Old Woman Was Killed in an Accident</h3>
<p>Lin Dai, an old woman from Huzhou, was 66 years old. She lived at a certain number on Hardoon Road in West Shanghai. At about 9:30 last night, she and her daughter went to Connaught Road to buy tea. Unfortunately, a No. 10 bus with license plate number 1543 sped by. Because the old woman was old and slow, she could not avoid it and was hit in the chest, critically injuring her. She was taken to a certain hospital in West Shanghai by ambulance for treatment, but it was ineffective and she died soon after.</p>
<h3>HWAXING COTTON WEAVING MILL: ACCOUNTANT SUDDENLY KIDNAPPED; KOREAN MAN BORROWS LICENSE FOR TEST DRIVE; CHEN XIAOBAO ARRESTED ON SUSPICION</h3>
<p>On the 30th of last month, around 10 AM, six kidnappers in a black-plated car sped to No. 44 Caobang, Daxilu, Yidingpan Road, in the Chinese territory of western Shanghai, near the Huaxing Cotton Mill. They got out of the car and went straight into the mill, asking to see the manager, Dong Gengsheng, for an important matter. As Dong was out, the accountant, Dong Yunshu, met them instead. Unexpectedly, these people suddenly pulled out guns and threatened him, sending two kidnappers to guard the door. Without asking any questions, they</p>
<p>carried out the kidnapping,</p>
<p>pushing Dong Yunshu into the car parked nearby. Like lightning, they disappeared in an instant. Subsequently, the mill reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station, which dispatched Chinese detective Wang Yubin and foreign detective Baideng to investigate. They learned that the black-plated car number was 1368, belonging to Wang Zinian, a trauma doctor at No. 5, Lane 23, Fuxu Road. The Chinese and foreign detectives immediately went to Dr. Wang's place to investigate and learned that the car had been entrusted to the Huanan Automobile Company at No. 365 Fuxu Road for sale. The detectives then went to Huanan to investigate and indeed discovered the 1368 car</p>
<p>license plates, two pieces.</p>
<p>However, according to the staff of Huanan Automobile Company, the 1368 car had already been sold, but the license plates were left in the company. On June 27th, Liu Dafu, a Korean man residing in the Youth Corps in Hongkou, bought a black hemp cloth car from the company. At the time, due to mechanical damage, it was slightly repaired and then driven out for a test drive. At that time, there were no license plates on the car, so the Korean man wanted to temporarily borrow the 1368 number, claiming that he would return it immediately. Unexpectedly, he never came back. It was not until 6 PM on July 3rd that Liu Dafu</p>
<p>accompanied a Chinese man,</p>
<p>together riding a Yunfei car No. 12315, to the Huanan car dealership, returning the 1368 license plates. However, this procedure was handled by Chen Xiaobao (18 years old), a Wuxi native learning to be a car mechanic at Huanan car dealership. At the time, Chen was not present, so the matter was not investigated. On one hand, they immediately went to Yunfei to inquire. According to the driver Li Amao, it was confirmed that someone hired a car that day, driven by him to the side of the Met Hesit Road telephone company, with a Korean man and a Chinese man riding together to the Huanan car dealership. The Chinese and foreign detectives returned to the police station after investigating this. On the 31st, they returned to</p>
<p>Huanan Automobile</p>
<p>Company, and arrested Chen Xiaobao. Suspecting his involvement, or complicity, they took him to the Jing'an Temple police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang detailed the above situation, requesting permission for detention in order to continue the investigation. Chen Xiaobao, defended by lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, was interrogated by the judge, who ordered Chen Xiaobao to be detained for seven days for further investigation. The reason for Dong Yunshu's kidnapping is currently under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>ROBBERY OF HUGE SUM OF MONEY AT A CERTAIN FAMILY'S HOME ON TIANJIN ROAD; ROBBERS OPEN FIRE AND INJURE A PERSON ON BINLANG ROAD</h3>
<p>At a certain family's home, No. 12, Lane 170, Tianjin Road, in the Public Concession, at 11:45 AM yesterday, three robbers broke in. Two robbers threatened them with guns, and as a result, 25,000 yuan in national currency was robbed, and they escaped with the loot. Afterward, the victim reported the incident to the relevant police station, requesting an arrest.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, robbers suddenly broke into No. 881 Binlang Road, West Shanghai, to carry out a robbery. The victim immediately shouted for help to catch the robbers. The robbers then opened fire, hitting the victim with a bullet. The victim fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Nearby Chinese police officers arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested the robbers on the spot. The injured person summoned an ambulance and was taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10 AM, a man walking near Daxilu Difeng Road was suddenly attacked by two unarmed robbers who robbed him of 430 yuan in legal tender and escaped without a trace.</p>
<h3>JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS OF BOTH COURTS PETITION TO RESTORE ORIGINAL SALARIES; COURT CLERKS ALSO REQUEST RAISES</h3>
<p>Huawen News Agency reports that since the outbreak of the August 13th incident, the First and Second Special District Local Courts of the Public and French Concessions in this city, as well as the First, Second, and Third Sub-Courts of the High Court, received orders from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to pay the salaries of presidents, judges, prosecutors, clerks, etc., at 70% of the original amount to conserve funds. It has been two years since the implementation. Recently, with the tightening of foreign exchange and the rise in prices, the cost of living in society has increased several times. The judges, prosecutors, and clerks of the court as a whole, due to the 70% salary, cannot maintain their livelihoods. They separately petitioned the Ministry of Judicial Administration in Chongqing to restore the original salaries to be paid in full. However, no decision has been received from the ministry so far. At the same time, the court clerks and other personnel of both courts, due to the difficulty of life, jointly submitted a petition to the president yesterday, requesting a salary increase.</p>
<h3>LI YONGKUAN AND SON CASE: TESTIMONY CONTINUED YESTERDAY</h3>
<p>The case of Li Yongkuan and his son, notorious salt smugglers and bandits from Anhui, who were accused of robbery and murder, has been repeatedly tried and investigated by Judge Liao Yan in conjunction with the prosecutor, and the conclusion was announced, with a date set for sentencing. Later, due to suspicions about the Li family plotting to kill the mother of the victim Lin, and the Li's wife's statement that the gold ring in the hanging case was exchanged by herself at Baochang Jewelry Store, not stolen, it was deemed that there were still doubtful points that had not been clarified. A detailed investigation and review was required, so the conclusion of the debate was canceled, and the debate was reopened after a scheduled hearing. This newspaper has reported the details of the matter repeatedly. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao ordered the three Li father and son to be brought to the First Criminal Court, and Li's wife Yao, daughter Rongzhen, and Li's son-in-law Zhang, as well as employees of Baochang Jewelry Store, were summoned to the court. First, Li Rongzhen was questioned about the circumstances surrounding her brother Jiaqu's killing of Lin Xiuhua's mother, Lin Jinshi. Then, the Baochang Jewelry Store was questioned about the gold ring exchange, and after checking the jewelry store's account books, there was no record of the sale of a gold ring with the style, pattern, weight of the hanging case. When Li Yao and Zhang were questioned, they still insisted that they exchanged it at Baochang, etc. After verifying the testimony in court, it was ordered to reschedule the hearing for the 10th of this month. The defendants were still detained, and the witnesses were dismissed. On the second day of this month, from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM, if the weather is good, the Municipal Council Music Band will hold a brass concert in French Park. The program includes seven items.</p>
<h3>COUNTY MAGISTRATE'S CONCUBINE ESCAPES WITH FUNDS; MONK PUNISHED FOR RECEIVING STOLEN GOODS; ALLOWED TO POST 8,000 YUAN SHOP GUARANTEE DURING APPEAL PERIOD</h3>

His concubine frequently associated with the monk Wan Yuan (secular name Tong Changyao) of the temple. Later, Yang and Sun moved to No. 3, Lane 44, Laoerdong Road. Sun still maintained contact with the monk Wan Yuan. On May 28th of this year, Sun suddenly absconded with 6,500 yuan in cash and gold jewelry. After the case occurred, the French Concession police, due to Monk Wan Yuan's receipt of stolen goods, ordered detectives to arrest him. Along with the stolen goods, such as embroidered pillowcases, seized from the monk's residence, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for prosecution on charges of receiving stolen goods. The defendant monk Wan Yuan hired lawyer Xu Wufang to defend him. The case has been tried by Judge Qiu. Yesterday morning, he announced the verdict in the Eighth Criminal Court. The main text stated: Tong Changyao, also known as Monk Wan Yuan, received stolen goods and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. The accompanying civil lawsuit part will be transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. The defendant is allowed to post an 8,000 yuan shop guarantee during the appeal period.</p>

Zhou's daughter, Qian Runwen, married a Han and had five sons, Jiepan, Zanyu, Shengshou, Shengjue, and Shengqi. Qian Runwen had also passed away. Han Jiepan and others, because their maternal grandfather's inheritance was controlled by Xie Jianjia,</p>
<p>this spring</p>
<p>together with their aunt Tang Qian Runduan, jointly hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Li Gengxiang, and Ge Bangren to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering the defendants Xie Jianjia, Qian Runlin, Qian Runhu, Qian Runci, Qian Runliang, Qian Runming, etc., to completely hand over all of Qian Xuanqing's inheritance, to be divided into seven shares, with Han Jiepan, Han Zanyu, Han Shengshou, Han Shengjue, Han Shengqi getting one-seventh in total, Tang Qian Runduan getting one-seventh, Qian Runlin, Qian Runhu, Qian Runci, Qian Runliang, Qian Runming each getting</p>
<p>one-seventh.</p>
<p>The court, after receiving the complaint, repeatedly summoned the defendants Xie Jianjia, Qian Runlin, etc., by Judge Ma Yishu. The defendants Xie Jianjia, Qian Runlin, etc., hired lawyers Zhang Yipeng, etc., to appear in court to respond.

<h3>HENAN EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES AND SCHOOL STATUS: PROVINCIAL FUNDS TIGHTENED, COUNTY FUNDS TRY TO RESTORE, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS RELOCATE THREE TIMES</h3>
<p>(Nanyang Correspondence) The Henan Provincial Education Administration formulated educational policies before the war, setting specific standards for vocational normal, senior and junior high school education, as well as school administration and discipline, and actively implemented them. After the outbreak of the war, it formulated four key points of wartime education policy, with standards suitable for the needs of the times for schools at all levels, social education, mass education, and special education, which were effectively implemented.</p>
<h3>Educational Expenses</h3>
<p>"Provincial Funds": The budget for the 26th year before the war was 2,899,900 yuan. By October of the 26th year, all schools were spending at 80% of the original amount. In March of the 27th year, various affiliated agencies were cut and merged, and the schools that had relocated were reorganized. A total of 45 classes were cut in secondary schools throughout the province, saving more than 25,000 yuan per month. In August of the 27th year, the funds for primary and secondary schools were issued at 56.7% of the budget for the 26th year. In February of the 28th year, the provincial primary school classes were reorganized, cutting 27 classes, saving 61,000 yuan per year. As a result of the successive tightening, the budget for the second half of the 27th year was 1,024,180 yuan, and the budget for the 28th year was 1,997,807 yuan. "County Funds": 3,405,454 yuan for the 26th year before the war, 1,638,319 yuan for the second half of the 27th year during the war, and 3,349,846 yuan was extended according to the budget for the 26th year in the 28th year. The highest was Anyang with 103,166 yuan, and Xuchang with 73,237 yuan. The lowest were Jingfu with 7,058 yuan, Song County with 3,709 yuan, and Lushi with 5,663 yuan.</p>
<h3>School Conditions</h3>
<p>Various schools have undergone three relocations. The "First" decision was made in October of the 26th year (of the Republic, i.e. 1937). Due to the tense situation in northern Henan, the private Jiaozuo Institute of Technology moved to Chang'an; Anyang High School moved to Wuyang; Baiquan Normal School and Gaoyang Junior High School moved to Runan; Qinyang Junior High School moved to Zheng County; Wuzhi Junior High School moved to Dengfeng; Jixian Normal School, Jixian Junior High School, and Jixian Vocational School moved to Yuxian; Anyang Private Binyang Junior High School moved to Xiangcheng. The "Second" decision was made in January of the 27th year (i.e. 1938). Due to the tense situation in Ji'nan and Xuzhou, and the severe situation in the Zhengzhou area, Henan University's Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences moved to Jigongshan; the Colleges of Agriculture and Medicine, the Water Conservancy College, Kaifeng High School, and Kaifeng Women's Normal School moved to Zhenping; Kaifeng Normal School and Kaifeng Girls' High School moved to Xichuan; Kaifeng Vocational School moved to Neixiang; Kaifeng Junior High School moved to Shangcheng; Shangqiu High School moved to Huaiyang; Private Liming High School moved to Sishui; Lianghe High School moved to Neixiang; Ji'zhi High School moved to Luoning; Songyang High School, Gansheng High School, and Qiangyu High School moved to Luoshan; Beicang Girls' High School moved to Nanyang; China High School moved to Lushan; Mingxin High School moved to Mixian; Modern High School moved to Nanzhao; Dahe High School moved to Gongxian; the County Arts Normal School moved to Dengfeng; Shangzhi Vocational School moved to Xinyang; and Zhongzhou Junior High School moved to Rongyang. In March of the same year, all eleven provincial elementary schools, three provincial capital elementary schools, the provincial Experimental People's School, the provincial Women's Supplementary School, and the various people's schools under the Provincial People's Education Administration were converted into wartime education work teams, and assigned to work in Xinyang, Tanghe, Biyang, Zhenping, Xichuan and other places. The "Third" time was in the summer of the 27th year (i.e. 1938). Xi'an was repeatedly bombed, so the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology moved again to Tianshui. In November, with the loss of southern Henan, Henan University's Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences moved back to Zhenping. The Provincial Education Department ordered all provincial schools south of the Funiu Mountains and east of Nanyang to move westward to Neixiang and Xichuan; all schools north of the Funiu Mountains were to first send personnel to find temporary school buildings in Lushi and Luoning before relocating. This included Luoyang Normal School, Luoyang Junior High School, and Luoyang Vocational School moving to Lushi and Luoning; Anyang Yuzhong, Huaiyang Normal School, Shangqiu High School, Huaiyang Junior High School, Qinyang Junior High School, and Jixian Normal School moving to Neixiang; Runan Junior High School and Hanchuan Junior High School moving to Xichuan. Among the private high schools, Songyang High School moved to Luoning, Beicang Girls' High School moved to Neixiang, Nanyang Girls' High School and Wannan Junior High School moved to Shiqiao, and Nandou Junior High School moved to Nantai.</p>
<h3>Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Discusses How to Choose Departments and Schools (Part 2) The School's Signboard Is Not Enough to Prove the Quality of the Content; There Are Several Aspects to Pay Attention to When Choosing a Department.</h3>
<p>(4) The Principle of a School's Signboard: What has been discussed above are the principles for choosing a department. Now, when it comes to choosing a school, people usually use the quality of the school's signboard as the standard for choosing a school. This is also very reasonable. There must be a reason why everyone says a school is good, whether it is good teachers, good equipment, good academic atmosphere, or good career prospects for graduates. These are all conditions that should be valued. However, the so-called good or bad of a school is often prone to an incorrect view. For example, that the school is large in scale, has many students, has a lot of funding, has good buildings, has a good location, and often has important people giving speeches, principal meetings, and school publicity. Many people in society praise that school because of these conditions and respect that school. Needless to say, these conditions can never be the correct standard for judging the quality of a school. A large-scale school is by no means a good school, and a school with a lot of funding is even less likely to be a good school. Large schools often have very bad professors, and schools with a lot of money often waste it in vain. Conversely, small universities can also have very good teachers, and schools with little money can easily achieve excellent results. Not only is this the case when comparing Chinese universities with Chinese universities, but also when comparing Chinese universities with foreign universities, foreign universities also have professors who are sloppy and far inferior to the excellent professors in Chinese universities. Of course, large-scale schools with a lot of funding are easier to run well, but whether they can run well depends on who the principal is, who the dean is, and whether the professors hired are top-notch.</p>
<h3>Academic Circles in Kunming Hold a General Meeting of the Friendship Association</h3>
<p>(Kunming, 1st) The Kunming Academic Friendship Association held its first general meeting at 4 p.m. on the 31st. More than 30 people, including Zhou Binglin, Cha Liangzhao, and Huang Shi, attended. Li Shuhua presided over the meeting and invited Chen Bisheng, an expert on border politics, to give a speech. Chen advocated for the development of roads from Yunnan to Tibet to connect the mainland with the border areas. There are two routes from Yunnan to Tibet: one from Wuding Yuanguang, passing through Huili Xichang and entering Tibet, and the other from Xiangyun Yunlong, passing through Xikang and reaching Lhasa. The construction of these two roads would greatly benefit culture and economy.</p>
<h3>Staff and Students in Jin and Yan Prefectures in Western Zhejiang Gather for Training, Starting Separately from the 1st.</h3>

They have agreed to concentrate staff and students in various places for training, which is more active than before the war. More than 60,000 teachers and students in various counties and cities throughout the province have received training. After receiving the order for the fourth centralized training this year, the Department of Education immediately instructed schools at all levels to carefully select and dispatch personnel. According to reports, the number of teachers and students receiving training has greatly increased compared to the first, second, and third sessions. The training has been carried out separately in various places since August 1.</p>

<h3>Hongyi Cup Volleyball Yesterday: Hongyi Defeated; Fudan Wins in a Three-Game Thriller; Friendship Star Easily Defeats Lianqing in Women's Division</h3>
<p>In the Hongyi Cup Volleyball League, Fudan faced Hongyi in the Group A match last night. Both sides had two wins in two matches, making for a fight to the death. However, three Hongyi players were injured or sick, and only eight players were able to compete. After the start of the match, both teams were locked in a close battle. Fudan took the lead with 11 to 8. Zhou Dayun and Yuan Zejian continued their efforts and won the first game with 21 to 15. In the second game, the score went back and forth, with only one point difference. After 15 points each, Hongyi's main player, Zai Deyuan, used his superb skills to tie the score at 21 to 16. In the final decisive game, Hongyi tried hard to fight back and switched sides with a score of 11 to 9. After 13 points each, Fudan surpassed and took the lead with 19 to 16. The Hongyi players calmly responded and tied the score at 20 each. Finally, Tan Yongzhan's two excellent spikes allowed Fudan to win again with 22 to 20. Hongyi failed to avenge their loss to Zhongqing in the previous match by a difference of two points, which is a pity. In the women's division, Friendship Star easily defeated Lianqing, as the victory or defeat was related to the championship.

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Finance: UK's Policy Towards China Unchanged; Forex Resale Suddenly Intensified</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices did not change. In the private market for British and American exchange rates, the banks' intention to sell was initially weak. It was estimated that British gold would shrink again by 1.25, and the US dollar would soften by 0.25. After the opening, news suddenly broke from Reuters that Chamberlain's attitude was firm and the policy towards China would not be changed. It was also stated that regarding the Japanese demand for the 48 million taels of silver stored by China in the Tianjin concession, discussions had been held with the US and France on how to deal with the matter. As a result, the prospects for the legal tender became more optimistic, so the intention to sell by foreign firms suddenly intensified. Hong Kong also sent telegrams to sell, and Japanese banks frequently sold current British and American exchange rates, causing the market to gradually return to equilibrium. As a result, the British rate was flat, and the US dollar rose by 0.0325. It was reported that Sassoon, a Western merchant, wanted to offer a rate of US$0.0625 for the spot and end-of-month swap (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of around 8%), but foreign firms such as Datong Bank only wanted to offer US$0.50, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate of around 6.3%. Therefore, few swaps were made. Overall, trading was still active.</p>
<p>Opening Was Slightly Tight</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the large London strip, the near-term continued to rise by 0.0625, and the far-term rose by 0.125. The New York silver price was stable, and the London gold price remained flat. In terms of exchange rates, the British rate against the US dollar was unchanged, the rate against Shanghai was slightly up by 0.06255, and the rate against France was unchanged. There were no changes in the US dollar rate against the British pound, Shanghai, or France. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. At the morning opening, the banks' selling prices for spot were 4 shillings 2.25 pence for British gold and 8.25 yuan for the US dollar, which was up by 1.25 pence for British gold and down by 0.25 yuan for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Suddenly, news broke of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo and Chamberlain's firm attitude, which caused the selling intentions of foreign firms to suddenly intensify, and the market immediately hardened. First, a British bank sold spot British gold at 4 shillings 3.125 pence to a foreign firm, then a bank sold spot US dollars at 8.3125 and 8.375 yuan to the Bombay Silver Company, and then sold spot US dollars at 8.4375 yuan to the China-Belgian-Dutch Bank. By the time HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes, and the white silver equalization tax was still exempt. After that, Hong Kong telegraphed to sell spot US dollars at 8.53125 yuan to foreign firms, and the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank also sold spot British gold at 4 shillings 3.75 pence and spot US dollars at 8.5625 yuan to the China-Belgian-Dutch Bank, which made the process quite loose. As noon approached, foreign firms took the opportunity to buy cheap, and the situation tended to level off. It was estimated that foreign firms had bought spot US dollars from foreign firms at 8.50 and 8.4375 yuan. At the noon close, the banks' selling prices for spot were 4 shillings 3.4375 pence for British gold and 8.4375 yuan for the US dollar, which was down by 0.09375 pence for British gold and up by 0.1875 yuan for the US dollar compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Japanese Banks Also Sold</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Yokohama Specie Bank continued to sell spot British gold at 4 shillings 4.0625 pence to foreign firms, as well as spot US dollars at 8.53125 and 8.5625 yuan. After that, the Yokohama Specie Bank also sold British gold for this month at 4 shillings to foreign firms and also sold US dollars for this month at 7.8125 yuan to foreign firms, which made the situation stable and hard. At the evening close, the banks' selling prices for spot were 4 shillings 3.75 pence for British gold and 8.53125 yuan for the US dollar, and for British gold for this month 4 shillings and US dollars 7.78125 yuan. As a result, the spot British pound was flat and the US dollar was up by 0.03125 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Shanghai Exchange Rate Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 1st The exchange market today opened firm. The current prices for British and American dollars were unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by three yuan, to 331 yuan. The Japanese exchange rate shrank by 0.125, to 104.625 yuan. At the noon close, the Shanghai exchange rate continued to rise by one yuan, to 330 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Steady</p>
<p>Tianjin, 1st The exchange market today opened steady. The British and American dollars were unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by three yuan, to 127 yuan. The "Joint Note" black market rebounded by two yuan, to 102 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday's private market for spot gold was volatile due to the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In general, it rose first, then fell, and then hovered. Initially, because the foreign exchange market opened sharply lower in the morning, bullish sentiment among dealers intensified, and they scrambled to bid up prices. In particular, a certain money exchange firm and securities brokers were actively buying, causing the morning opening to rise to 3,690 yuan, and then to a peak of 3,695 yuan. Subsequently, news broke from Reuters that Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons that he would not change his policy towards China, which gradually hardened. This caused sentiment to change. A certain gold shop's intention to sell on behalf of speculators became even stronger, and many people came to close out their positions, causing the market to decline. It once fell back to a low of 3,610 yuan. Later, a certain jewelry store (on behalf of Hong Kong) and securities brokers came to absorb at low prices, and the market gradually stabilized, hovering between 3,640 and 3,650 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 3,640 yuan, only down three yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still active, at 800 to 900 taels. There were no gains or losses in jewelry gold, and the customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Private Market for Spot Gold Was Twisty</h3>
<p>Since the morning opening, because the foreign exchange market opened at only 4 pence 25 for British gold and only 8.25 yuan for US dollars, the sentiment among dealers was buoyant. For a time, large sums were eagerly purchased, causing a significant increase in prices. The opening price was raised by 47 yuan. A certain money exchange firm bought 30 taels from a certain gold shop and 20 taels from a cash shop, at a price of 3,690 yuan. Then, it rose by another five yuan. Securities brokers bought 40 taels from a certain gold shop, at a price of 3,695 yuan, which was the peak for the day. At that time, it was suddenly heard that the foreign exchange market was hardening due to the intensified selling by foreign firms, so buyers waited and watched. In an instant, it fell back by 45 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 50 taels to a certain jewelry store, at a price of 3,650 yuan. Later, securities brokers came to absorb again, and prices rose again. Securities brokers bought 50 taels from the money exchange firm, at a price of 3,665 yuan. After that, although a certain jewelry store and a certain money exchange firm and securities brokers absorbed from each other, the foreign exchange market gradually hardened, and a certain gold shop continued to sell on behalf of speculators, the market tended to decline. Soon, it plunged by 55 yuan. The cash shop sold 10 taels to a certain silver shop, at a price of 3,610 yuan, which was the low for the day. After 11:30, it was heard that the foreign exchange market had stopped loosening and was slightly soft, so the buying intention became stronger, and the price immediately rebounded. A certain jewelry store bought 40 taels from a certain gold shop, at a price of 3,635 yuan. Then, securities brokers bought 10 taels from the money exchange firm, at a price of 3,650 yuan. Later, the jewelry store sold 10 taels to a certain silver shop, and the price fell back to 3,635 yuan. As noon approached, a certain money exchange firm bought 50 taels from a dealer, at 3,645 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the opening price rose by 10 yuan. The money exchange firms traded 20 taels among themselves, at a price of 3,655 yuan. After the opening, a certain gold shop and money exchange firms frequently sold, and the market weakened. Before long, it fell by 15 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 30 taels to securities brokers, at a price of 3,640 yuan. Later, the money exchange firm bought 30 taels from the jewelry store, at a price of 3,642 yuan. Then, the gold shops traded 20 taels among themselves, at a price of 3,645 yuan. At 3:20, the money exchange firms traded 50 taels among themselves, at a price of 3,640 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by three yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that there were transactions at 3,645 yuan after the close. The whole day fluctuated by 85 yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there was little trading.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Gold Results Were Neutral</h3>
<p>The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was still 370 yuan at major dealers. At 9:30, it was raised by five yuan. After a moment, it suddenly fell by 10 yuan. At 12:03, it rebounded by five yuan. After that, there were no changes. As a result, there were no gains or losses. The major dealers still had it at 370 yuan, and new dealers had it at 368 yuan. The price for buying it back was reduced by 10 yuan or so.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 31st, the price of British pure gold remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pence per ounce, which caused the central bank's purchase price for Chinese cash to remain stable at 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold also remained flat, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price was also still at 1107.09 jiao.</p>
<h3>US Dollars and Pounds Rise by Three Yuan; Demand for British Gold Notes Is Also Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of British and American gold pounds rebounded due to the high opening price of spot gold. Although the spot gold market weakened in the evening, the prices remained firm due to the scarcity of supply. The demand for British gold notes was strong, and the price continued to rise due to the lack of supply in the market. The supply of US dollar notes was smooth due to the easing of foreign exchange, and the market saw a slight decline. The prices of Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, and Annam notes were relatively high due to the large number of people going to the southwest. The price of Japanese gold notes fell daily, and it was 1.05 yuan in the evening market. The supply of Korean notes was scarce, and the market was slightly firm, at 8 jiao and 8 fen in the evening market. No public association transactions were made. Yesterday's market prices: British pound rose by one yuan, British gold notes rose by three jiao, US gold pound rose by one jiao, US dollar notes fell by 0.25 jiao, Hong Kong notes rose by 2 fen, French franc notes rose by 1 li, Annam notes rose by 5 fen, and the prices of other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Demand for Cash Decreases; Discount Rates Plunge</h3>
<p>--60 Yuan--</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange and drafts fell sharply. The discount rate per thousand yuan has broken into the 200 yuan mark. This is because China's financial situation has stabilized, and the craze for grabbing foreign exchange and buying gold has subsided, resulting in a sharp decrease in the demand for cash. In the early morning, it was still around 220 yuan, but then it retreated by 20 yuan due to the surge in the supply of cash. At noon, it was 200 yuan. After breaking into 200 yuan in the afternoon, it could not be sustained and plunged straight down. Finally, it hit a low of 160 yuan, which was down 60 yuan compared to the final price of the previous day. The Money Industry Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged, at 2 jiao for both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Stamps Used as Change; 120 Fen per Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the general use of stamps as change, they become invalid once they are damaged. Citizens are hoping for fractional currency notes, and they have been "necking like gourds" waiting for them. However, the newspapers are constantly promoting when they will arrive and when they will be available. It can be said that they have done their utmost to promote them, but it is only "hearing the sound of footsteps but not seeing anyone come down." As a result, fractional transactions can only be done with stamps. The stamps stored by stores cannot all be found, so there is a method of selling them in whole sheets. Currently, one yuan can be exchanged for 110 fen or even 120 fen, but refusals are also common.</p>
<h3>City Market Increases Hard Currency: 9 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Silver Money Trade Association of this city, due to the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram announcement regarding the regulation of funds among members and to facilitate the payment of legal tender deposits of 500 yuan or less, consulted with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to standardize the total amount of exchange deposits held by member institutions in the Silver Money Treasury as of the end of June, totaling 22 million yuan, which was converted into legal tender at 95% of face value and withdrawn in twelve weekly installments, entrusted to the Bank Reserve Committee for handling. Payments began on July 4th, with July 4th being the first installment, July 11th the second, July 18th the third, July 25th the fourth, and yesterday (August 1st) the fifth installment payment date. Yesterday, silver money businesses went to the Reserve Committee to complete payment procedures. Some withdrew hard currency, while others transferred funds into their legal tender current accounts with the committee, resulting in a total increase of 1.8 million yuan in legal tender reserves for the industry. Over the five installments, the silver money industry has increased circulating legal tender by 9 million yuan. The recent sharp drop in rediscount rates is undoubtedly related to this. The sixth installment is scheduled for payment on the 8th (next Tuesday). (Eagle)</p>
<h3>Silver Bar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>London dispatch, July 31st: The silver market saw Indian buying and short covering, but American firms sold, leaving the market balanced. Prices remained steady after closing, to the satisfaction of buyers. Large silver bars rose 0.0625 for near-term delivery and 0.125 for forward delivery. New York silver dispatch: American spot prices remained stable. Bombay silver dispatch: The Indian silver market was stable, spot prices rose 2 annas, and futures rose 3 annas. A total of 100 contracts were traded.</p>
<h3>Securities: Internal Debt is Key, More Critical Than the Situation</h3>
<p>In the over-the-counter securities market yesterday, trading was conducted with the seventh coupon already accounted for. Opening prices differed from the previous day's prices, including interest, by 2.12 yuan, suggesting solid market prices. The range of price fluctuations was narrow, limited to increases or decreases of only 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. Since June 19th, the interest issue has caused widespread commotion. This can now be considered resolved. The seventh coupon's principal and interest can now be concluded. The government has effectively ceased payment, with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications doing their best to temporarily advance exchange drafts to maintain the market. How to handle the eighth coupon's principal and interest is another issue, so this decision cannot be considered a precedent. Regarding the environment, the Sino-British, Sino-Japanese, and European issues are gradually becoming more serious. Counterfeit currency is spreading rapidly. The Anglo-Japanese problem has reached a critical juncture. The European situation is complex and tense. With storm clouds gathering, public debt market prices fluctuate accordingly. Previously, the principal and interest issues were key, but now the focus will shift to the political situation. Yesterday's trading was unusually quiet, with buying and selling showing no enthusiasm. Sellers were Tiansheng Songmao and Fuchun, and buyers were Lianyi Hongkang and No. 31. Activity was very slow, mainly short-term speculative trades, resulting in a transaction volume of only over 200,000 yuan. All bonds were ex-interest. Newly made gains and losses are not listed. Below are the high, low, and closing prices. London foreign debt prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 40 shares of Chinese-owned electrical company stock were traded at a price of 5.3 yuan. According to a report from the Public Chamber of Commerce, although the price of rubber raw materials in New York rose and the local foreign exchange market was stable, yesterday's trading was very quiet. Industrial and rubber stocks saw little change.</p>
<p>The London branch of the British-owned Far Eastern Company's stock market listings for July 31st (Monday) showed that the HSBC stock price was listed at a new price after deduction of interest. London-registered shares were £75, and Hong Kong-registered shares were £77. Mercantile Bank rose 5 shillings to £6 17s 6d. The coal mine stock price from last Friday's telegram was incorrect. The Kailan Mining Administration stock price should have been 15s 6d. Korean coal mine stock remained unchanged at 4s 9d. Kulakkalam Rubber rose 6 pence to 18 shillings. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Frenzied Stockpiling, Cotton Yarn Prices Soar, Texchem Sets a Record High of 675 Yuan, Even Cold Stock Rises by 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend was particularly pronounced and rapid. Due to rumors circulating in the market, sentiment turned bullish. Although the foreign exchange and gold markets remained stable, speculators' desire to hoard cotton yarn resurfaced. Buyers rushed in, and the market moved forward vigorously. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose to 588 yuan, only 7 yuan lower than the previous peak. The price of 20-count Texchem, however, rose fearsomely, rising for three consecutive days by a total of 55 yuan, closing at 675 yuan, setting a new record in the history of the yarn industry. Despite the soaring prices, hoarders not only refused to sell their existing yarn but continued to buy and store it deeply.</p>
<p>The yarn market opened extremely strong in the morning. Most market participants were buying, creating a sense of panic. Rumors circulated, intensifying the buying frenzy and driving prices higher. Spot prices for 20-count Bianma yarn from foreign firms opened at 571 yuan, and warehouse order prices were 555 yuan. Prices then rose rapidly. Spot prices for Double Horse yarn closed at 588 yuan, and warehouse order prices were 572 yuan. Statistics show that various firms bought a total of 1,380 bales in the morning, plus 210 bales traded in the afternoon of the previous day. Prices for 20-count Double Horse rose 22 yuan, Texchem rose 25 yuan, Mutton Brand rose 13.5 yuan, and cold stocks also rose 20 yuan. Today, 25 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 410  Mainland: 175</p>
<p>Traders: 735 Tianjin: 50</p>
<p>Total: 1,380</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market also soared. The reasons for this are unclear. The price of 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month is said to be 460 yuan.</p>
<p>Another report states that in the cotton yarn market, for the same count and grade of cotton yarn produced by different mills, excluding unpopular new brands, prices for popular old brands can vary widely. For example, the quality of Shen Er's 20-count Tiannv yarn and Shen Jiu's 20-count Double Horse yarn, in terms of thread evenness, color, and tensile strength, is not inferior to Double Horse yarn. Why is Tiannv yarn always 17 or 18 yuan or even 25 or 26 yuan cheaper than Double Horse yarn? This leaves outsiders confused, especially since the selling price of Tiannv yarn once exceeded that of Double Horse yarn. There is a need to explain this situation.</p>
<p>According to industry insiders, the price of "Double Horse" is higher than "Tiannv" because the mill maintains close relationships with its customer firms. Sometimes, customer firms request that the mill increase production or advance delivery dates to meet shipping schedules. The mill can accommodate these requests and provide various forms of convenience to its customers. Shipping schedules can take a long time, greatly affecting sales and prices. Since customers benefit from the mill's convenience, they naturally make efforts to promote it and compete for Double Horse brand yarn in the market. Thus, the Double Horse brand enjoys great popularity and high prices. "The quality of the yarn is not particularly superior to Tiannv's."</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Traders Buy and Sell: Volume Reaches 3,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Cotton trading remained sluggish. However, buying and selling among Indian cotton traders was unusually vigorous. Most of these transactions were resold to mills. However, due to the financial emergency, mills' buying activity showed no signs of improvement. Today, transactions among traders totaled 3,000 bales, all for warehouse delivery. Prices continued to rise by 3 or 4 yuan. Supplies from northern Jiangsu decreased further. Only 28 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the docks. The current cotton situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Bailuo Cotton: 106.00-107.75; Bought by traders: 450 bales; Premium, warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Packed Cotton: 110.00; Bought by traders: 248 bales; Also, warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Hughes &amp; Co: 109.25; Also, 000 bales; Also, warehouse delivery</p>

<p>Pingguo Cotton: 86.75; Also, 300 bales; Also, warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Laigong Cotton: 99.00; Also, 400 bales; Also, warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Hughes &amp; Co: 136.00; Also, 200 bales; Exchange, warehouse delivery</p>

<p>Xinte Cotton: 85.50; Also, 300 bales; Also, warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Dullila Cotton: 110.00; Purchased by Japanese-Chinese mill: 200 bales; Also, Also</p>
<p>Another report: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was very quiet. Chinese mills had ample inventories and temporarily did not purchase. However, Japanese mills' inventories, according to reliable figures, were only sufficient for one month. Therefore, they have been absorbing spot goods from traders in the market, with payment terms delayed until late this month.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market opened strongly this morning due to favorable telegrams from Liverpool and Bombay, with prices rising 3-5 points. Traders and overseas cotton merchants actively bought in the market. Due to the firmness of prices in the southern spot market and some short covering, prices rose again. Prices closed very strongly, up 14-15 points from the previous day. Washington news: The government is concerned that the release of the pricing for the previously proposed new cotton loan program will lead to another increase in loan storage of cotton and is temporarily withholding the announcement. Yesterday, Indian cotton rose one rupee, including forecasts, and Egyptian cotton rose 10 points.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth Soars, Hoarders Active in Domestic Cloth</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Eastern cloth soared. Although domestic mills' prices are high, wholesalers' goods are cheaper than Eastern cloth.</p>
<p>Therefore, wholesale shops, dyeing factories, and hoarders in this street are all actively buying. Demand from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian firms is also strong. Market prices are gradually rising. As a result, light and heavy coarse cloth rose 0.25-0.5 yuan, fine cloth and fine twill rose 0.1-0.25 yuan per bolt, and serge and woolen cloth rose 0.01-0.02 yuan per yard. Dyed cloth and flannel prices also rose by 0.3-0.5 yuan. Trading was most active in this street, with over 500 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill, and dyed cloth traded. Firms from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia bought 4,000-5,000 bolts of fine twill, dyed cloth, dyed twill, and bleached cloth. Firms from Yantai and Tianjin bought over 100 pieces of serge, woolen cloth, flannel, and coarse cloth. Firms from Ningbo and Shaoxing bought over 100 bales of coarse cloth, dyed cloth, and dyed twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of white fine cloth and fine twill soared by 0.7-0.8 yuan per bolt because firms from Tianjin and Zhaohuangdao in the north continued to buy. The spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose to 16.25 yuan per bolt, with this month's warehouse order at 16.5 yuan and September delivery opening at 16.7 yuan. Northern firms bought over 1,000 pieces of various brands of spot goods. Due to the sharp reduction in cash discounts for future sales, traders and dyeing factories in this street also showed strong interest, with transactions reaching 500-600 pieces. The forward price for Dragon Head fine cloth for next month was 16.75 yuan, Three Peach fine cloth 15.5 yuan, and Five Blessings fine cloth 15.75 yuan, but the volume was small and market sentiment was strong. Firms from Tianjin bought over 100 cases of Four Gentlemen serge dyed cloth. Japanese merchants were unwilling to offer more, and market prices have repeatedly increased to 0.465 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>On the 2nd, 15 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Food: Still Stockpiling Rice, Limits Imposed on All Goods</h3>
<p>Local Rice: After the arrival of goods from various sources was cleared, another 2,000+ bags of cartwheel wrapped rice arrived yesterday. However, goods from the river delta have not arrived and are expected to arrive this afternoon, including 11 ships from Nangang and Songjiang, towed to Shanghai by small boats. In terms of sales, after a previous decline, shops in this street showed renewed interest yesterday, and hoarders also took the opportunity to buy, tightening the situation. All goods rose in price. As a result, the prices of thick and thin Japonica rice reached their limit, and the price of Du Yang Jian rice also increased by varying amounts of 0.3-0.4 yuan. The prices of Bianwu rice were inactive, and the market was stable. Wuxi Su Geng rice was priced at 20 yuan, Songjiang wrapped thin rice at 20 yuan, Hu Jian rice at 19.7 yuan, Yang Jian rice at 19.3-19.4 yuan, Du Jian rice at 18.8 yuan, Wu Jian rice at 16 yuan, Su Re rice at 15.6 yuan, Bian Jian rice at 15.4 yuan, and Bian Yuan rice at 21.5-21 yuan. Total transactions were over 4,300 bags.</p>
<p>Customer Xian Rice: Rumors of the origin opening up have repeatedly circulated in the market. However, no telegrams have been received as of yesterday. As shops in this street and retail customers actively bought, prices rose again. The selling price of Ji Shao rough rice, below the market price, rose by 0.2-0.4 yuan to the 16 yuan limit. Buying and selling were both active. Total transactions for the day exceeded 4,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Active Sales, Restrictions Still Imposed on Bulk Sales, Wheat Market Improving</h3>
<p>The current flour market sales continued to be active, with both northern and southern firms placing orders. Retail sales in this street and inland areas also continued to be brisk. Therefore, the market remained firm. Due to the high price of imported wheat raw materials and the bullish market for local wheat, factories continued to restrict bulk sales to customers and hoarders. The amount of reclaimed goods in the market has dried up, and sellers were unwilling to sell cheaply. The total volume of this week's transactions was close to 40,000 bags. The price from No. 2 flour mill was uniformly 5 yuan in cash. It is reported that the selling price of reclaimed goods was 0.05-0.1 yuan higher than the mill price.</p>
<p>The supply of new wheat continued to increase. In addition to the continued arrival of wheat from Jiangsu, Kunshan, Beijing, and Zhenjiang, wheat from Guandian and Wuyi also arrived in succession. Since Chinese mills officially purchased new wheat the day before, hoarders became more active in acquiring it, pushing the market into a better position. Yesterday, Fuxin Mill continued to buy 2,000 bags, and hoarders in this street bought over 3,000 bags. The price of Suzhou high wheat was 6.9 yuan, Kunshan 6.88 yuan, Changzhou 6.76 yuan, and wheat from Puzhen, Danyang, and Wuyi was 6.57-6.53 yuan. The market was firm.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Raw Peanuts Short, Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Raw Peanuts: Due to the recent shortage of supplies, prices have risen repeatedly. With no new supplies arriving, the total number of cases sold to the market was ten. With the risk of running out of stock, the selling price of raw peanuts at Da Yang Zhuang rose another 5 yuan yesterday, reaching 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Among miscellaneous grains, 235 bags of beans will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Imported Sugar Relaxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to overseas telegrams, the sugar market saw no changes. With the guild's assigned prices and soft demand, the spot price of 24th grade coarse white sugar fell by 0.6 yuan to 33.4 yuan at this warehouse and 33.3 yuan at foreign warehouses. Re-export sugar fell by 0.5 yuan to 25 yuan. Taikoo granulated white sugar also fell slightly by 0.2 yuan, with West Warehouse B mark at 38.4 yuan, CW mark at 38.1 yuan, CH mark at 37.8 yuan, DY mark at 37.4 yuan, and HX mark at 37.2 yuan. H mark crude red sugar fell slightly by 0.5 yuan to 22 yuan. Dutch red spot sugar fell slightly by 0.1 yuan to 29 yuan, and re-export sugar fell to 21.2 yuan. There were no other major changes. Domestic sugar prices eased with the reduction in discounts, and the market was slightly stable. Only 60+ bags of Huanggang Qing sugar were sold at 26.8 yuan, with no other transactions. Also, 18,000 bags of sugar arrived yesterday.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Siamese Light Vegetables Available</h3>
<p>-Price Up 10 Yuan From Before-</p>
<p>Siamese dried mussels: This year's production was not abundant, so deliveries have been scarce for a long time. There are still accumulated stocks here, barely sufficient for sales. However, due to foreign exchange rates, sourcing new supplies is difficult. Yesterday, sales of medium-quality dried mussels opened at a cash price of 88 yuan, up 10 yuan from before.</p>
<h3>Coal: Indian Bituminous Coal, Industries Manipulate Prices Upward</h3>
<p>Indian Bituminous Coal: Although the orders placed by various industries last month reached 20,000+ tons, the market was not relaxed but maintained high prices. The price of lump coal has risen to 70 yuan per ton, up a total of 30 yuan. Retail shops in this street had to buy at market prices to meet demand. Retail sales at the store level were 9 yuan per basket, barely enough to make a profit.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Steel Plates Sought After in Tianjin</h3>
<p>The new steel plate market price is high due to over demand. Yesterday, Tianjin firms, due to demand, approved the batch purchase of hundreds of dan from traders in this street for shipment when there are suitable ships. Local shipyards and machinery factories are also purchasing slightly. The price is around 10 yuan higher than before. The current market price for 2.5 fen is 42 yuan, 5 and 7.5 fen are priced at 35 yuan, 10 fen is sold at 28 yuan, and 15 fen and up to patterned types are priced at around 25 yuan.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Q&amp;A (2)</h3>
<p>After a moment of silence, the Westerner asked again: "Strange! Neither for practice nor for spectacle, for what purpose is it established? Truly incomprehensible." The answer: "These people rent land to trade." The Westerner said: "Does your honorable gateway allow others to rent? Who dares to rent out the country's city gate? Do officials greed for such petty profits?" The answer: "This is not the intention of the authorities." The Westerner said:</p>
<p>"Why do the authorities not prohibit it?" The answer: "Difficult to say! According to regulations, building houses within the city walls is prohibited. Last year, building houses was almost universal. The authorities discovered it and ordered all to be demolished, but it took several months to demolish only half. When building, it was completed in a few days, but when demolishing, it was so slow. The execution of orders cannot match the incentive of profit. The Westerner said: "Surely there is no way to remedy this, allowing it to accumulate and crowd. After a long time, those who want to visit Shanghai will not be able to enter." The answer: "Perhaps there is a profound intention to obstruct people. We ordinary people cannot know. You are foreigners. Why must you be so verbose? As the saying goes: 'Everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, don't mind the frost on other people's roofs.' Please remember these words." The Westerner said: "Alas! Since you said 'Everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door,' why does your country's city gate not manage itself? Now, the barbican is a strategic and vital place for defense. A glasses shop has suddenly opened in the barbican of the new North Gate, and a dried tofu shop and a pipe stall have opened at the small East Gate, and a bookstore and cloth shop at the large East Gate. Allowing people to live in such vital locations, who will bear the responsibility if there are unexpected accidents?" Will be published tomorrow: Catching freeloaders</p>

<h3>Pugachev</h3>
<p>- Yan Hua</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>After watching "Pugachev," one immediately thinks of "Chapayev." One was the leader of the revolution in the era of serfdom, and the other was the leader of a guerrilla force later organized into a formal Red Army to fight the White Russian forces. Although the methods are different and the times are different, the spirit of resistance and revolutionary fervor are exactly the same.</p>
<p>But why did "Pugachev" end in a terrible defeat, while "Chapayev" became one of the strongest military leaders of the Red Army, capable of utilizing guerrilla warfare? As Lenin said:</p>
<p>"At that time, the peasants were still very ignorant. They could not unite, and they had no helpers or brothers among the urban workers, but the peasants still fought as they could and as they were able. The peasants were not afraid of the government's barbaric reprisals, they were not afraid of whippings, they were not afraid of bullets."</p>
<p>However, the peasant revolution (1773-1774) did not bring about a new system or new methods of production. Moreover, the soldiers who had just been freed from serfdom had very vague ideas about revolution and political consciousness. At that time, their only demand, as Stalin said, was that they opposed the landlords and simply hoped for a "good emperor."</p>
<p>"Pugachev"—this "hero of the marshes" circulating among the Russian people—finally led 600,000 serfs in a grand and vigorous struggle in the history of the Russian revolution. Although this revolution against landlords encountered serious setbacks, the Russian peasants had already been imbued with revolutionary blood.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>While Soviet film studios were producing a large number of historical films, we in Shanghai saw "Peter the Great" and this film "Pugachev."</p>
<p>"Peter the Great" was the starting point for the revitalization of Russia. Thanks to his efforts, the new Russia emerged later. What lessons can "Pugachev" give us?</p>
<p>This "hero of the marshes," his tragic failure, and the participation of 600,000 serfs in this struggle, provide much to learn for China in the midst of resistance:</p>
<p>(1) Pugachev left his family, wife, and children to lead this struggle;</p>
<p>(2) When he discovered that some of his revolutionary comrades were betraying him, he generously forgave them, saying that now was not the time for settling scores, but rather a time when everyone should work together;</p>
<p>(3) Pugachev was not only a brave and decisive revolutionary leader, but he was also clear about the difference between enemies and friends. After the Bashkir people joined forces with Pugachev to resist the oppression of the Tsar, there was a brief misunderstanding, but Pugachev used the utmost sincerity to make the Bashkir people shake hands with him again.</p>
<p>These are Pugachev's greatest qualities, but Pugachev's failure is still plainly revealed in the film, such as the lack of organization in the army and the failure to utilize new combat methods, especially the two points mentioned above.</p>
<p>Therefore, history is absolutely not "antiques" moved out unchanged. We must critically accept the lessons of history through a new historical perspective.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Every scene in "Pugachev" shows the people's hatred and wavering towards the imperial family and landlords in the era of serfdom. Not only commoners, but also the so-called imperial army, were unwilling to serve the imperial family.</p>
<p>The script strongly grasps the resentment of the serfs and prisoners and the hot and joyful state of the spreading revolution. The cheers of the serfs and the loud laughter of the peasant soldiers when reviewing the imperial army prisoners are deeply moving. The director, Petrov, not only grasps these aspects tightly, but also writes about human relationships, the emotions of war, and the atmosphere appropriately. Pugachev's separation from his wife, the battle scene of the attack on Kazan, and after Pugachev's defeat, the beacons along the winding river, the weeping of the horn, and the sad and mournful meaning, are even more directly touching.</p>
<p>I believe that Bedov is a good director.</p>
<p>But there are naturally shortcomings in the script, such as the fact that many transitions are not written sufficiently, and it is not a clever technique to use subtitles to explain a new stage.</p>
<p>The actor who plays Pugachev, Scurolobagadorov, is exceptionally lovable for his broad movements and strong character. Kolyugina, who plays his wife, is a rare actress for her simplicity and warmth.</p>
<h3>The Confession of a Gambling Den Waiter</h3>
<p>— Xie Tianshen</p>
<p>Temporarily Taking Refuge in a Place of Punishment for a Living – To Those Who Envy Them, Please Seek a Path of Light</p>
<p>It is not to boast about the luxurious life of Zhang, a gambling den waiter, nor to promote the gambling den. To seek survival in that muddy whirlpool is truly not my wish. Because I am subjected to the constraints of my environment, it has dictated my intentions, and I serve as a waiter in a place of punishment.</p>
<p>The job of a gambling den waiter is coveted and envied by some unemployed or low-paid individuals. However, they have not experienced it and do not know the bitterness of being a waiter. Some even spend hundreds of dollars trying to secure a waiter position in the gambling den, but often fail to achieve their wish. My ability to secure a position in the gambling den was half due to connections and half due to bribes, which helped me to achieve my current occupation.</p>
<p>My daily working hours are from 1 PM to 9 PM (on duty), a total of eight hours. Every ten days, the time is changed once, from 9 PM to 5 AM the next day (off duty). This distribution of service time is a continuous cycle.</p>
<p>My task is to entertain the guests and senior staff in the gambling den. During working hours, my entire body is not free, and I am bound and at their beck and call. As for our remuneration, it is calculated on a daily basis. If we are absent for one day, one day's salary is deducted from the monthly salary. In addition, there is "opium money" (extra income). This additional gain comes from diligently entertaining guests at ordinary times. If gamblers develop a good impression of you, they will give you a small tip after winning, to reward your good intentions. This monthly income is sufficient to maintain a family of nine in this "rice as precious as pearls, firewood as expensive as cassia" era.</p>
<p>All employees in the gambling den are not allowed to participate in gambling in the den. This rule is established by the owner and is enforced very strictly. The owner feels that the presence of employees in the den is unsightly, neglects their duties, and if they win, it will inevitably make them even more ambitious. If they lose, it will naturally cause economic problems, the employees' misfortune, indirectly embezzling public funds or directly affecting business.</p>
<p>To outsiders, this kind of life and work seems very leisurely, and the salary and extra income are so abundant that they are envious. But we are busy all day for the comfort of the gamblers, and there is never a moment for you to rest peacefully.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say to my compatriots who envy us; to seek a living in this evil, filthy, immoral, and self-destructive trap is indeed not a glorious career. It is better to seek another bright and legitimate career. The reason why I seek a living in the gambling den, which is scolded by society, is only for temporary living. My confession is not only to disclose a little of our life to all sectors, but also to give a warning to the compatriots who envy our beautiful profession!</p>
<h3>The Sky Clears After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Thousands of Homes with Fireworks, Rural Cooperation; Myriad Miles of Waves, Overseas Flight</p>
<p>When He Youyu heard this, she hooked her arms around Shuangyu's neck and shouted, "Good elder sister!" and kissed her endlessly. Everyone! Isn't it said that He Shuangyu and He Liyu are twins? Who is the older sister? Who is the younger sister? This question cannot be resolved now. But the custom in society is always to consider the one who comes out of the womb first to be the elder and the one who comes out of the womb later to be the younger. It turned out that Shuangyu was born twenty minutes earlier than Youyu. Although the two babies were exactly the same, the obstetrician who delivered them had identified them clearly. Later, their mother, Mrs. He, also followed the social custom and regarded Shuangyu, who was born twenty minutes earlier, as the elder sister, and Liyu, who was born twenty minutes later, as the younger sister. When they grew up, the family did not call them Miss Senior or Miss Junior, but it was obvious that one had to be distinguished as first and the other as last, so they sometimes called each other sisters. Now Liyu saw Shuangyu say that if she were to go to the United States for inspection and to purchase machines, she was willing to let her go first, fulfilling her wish, so she was very happy. Because at this moment, going from China to the United States by plane is very convenient. From Shanghai to New York, it takes at most five days. Flying back and forth over the Pacific Ocean is not a big deal, as easy as people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang crossing Tai Lake. Originally, the international civil aviation flight across the Pacific Ocean had already begun in the autumn of 1935. At first, it departed from San Francisco in the United States and ended in Manila in the Philippines. This was just a trial flight. But it showed that no matter how much you were in the ocean, you could not stop your wings from soaring. In the spring of 1937, this route reached Hong Kong, which was considered the completion of the direct air route between China and the United States. This aviation route is more than 8,700 miles long and all of it is flying over the ocean, which is a great advance in the aviation world. That was only between San Francisco and Hong Kong, because various parts of China were troubled by the war with Japan, so even Shanghai and several other major trading ports could not fly civil aviation directly. It was not until after the war was settled that Pan American's giant aircraft could come to Shanghai. At that time, China's international air flights were well-connected. In addition to the Pan American Company's Pacific giant planes, which came to the Far East every week, there were also the British Imperial Airways, such as the China-Burma line, the China-Siam line, the China-India line, and the China-Singapore line (China to Singapore), which were all open. As for the China-Vietnam line, which was operated by Air France, flying directly from Kunming to Hanoi, it had already been completed ten years ago. And the line from Shanghai directly to Paris was also opened by Sino-French Aviation Corporation thirty years ago. (166)</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>The Wonderful Use of Sound Films</h3>
<p>— De Gang</p>
<p>In addition to providing people with audio-visual entertainment, sound films have recently been invented in France to record many legal events. The most common is the use of sound films to record wills. The person making the will, in addition to writing it down, also reads the will aloud. The camera records the words in the will and the person making the will and other witnesses at the time, and incorporates them into the film. If there is a dispute in the future, just playing the film can solve everything, which is ten thousand times more reliable than relying solely on the will. Because documents can be forged, but there is no way to fake a film.</p>
<p>Recently, many city governments in France have sound film recording equipment. Whenever there are more important legal procedures that must be held in the city government, such as marriage and divorce, they are all filmed by the camera, and two copies are made, one kept in the city government and the other given to the parties for safekeeping.</p>
<p>This kind of film is smaller than ordinary movie films, only 16mm, and is very suitable for home screening. Therefore, after the death of their parents, if the younger generation often screens the film of their elders' last words, it is as if they are seeing the voices and faces of their ancestors again. This is very consistent with our country's ancient teaching of being cautious in mourning and pursuing the distant past.</p>
<h3>The Auction of Movie Star Photos is Announced</h3>
<p>— Yin Si</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun's Photo for Six Thousand Gold · Chen Yunshang Ranks Second ·</p>
<p>The Chinese movie star photo exhibition, to sell funds for disaster relief, was held for a charity sale for eight days from the 27th of last month to yesterday. In addition to the more than 1,000 photos of celebrities from the entire film industry, there were also ten 30-inch enlarged color photos of the top ten stars for public auction.</p>
<p>Auction Results</p>
<p>Under the dual perspectives of enthusiastic disaster relief and encouragement of outstanding artists, the photos of Miss Gu Lanjun and Chen Yunshang simultaneously aroused the most intense competition. Miss Gu's photo started with a bid of 500 yuan, and the two bidders repeatedly increased the price by 1,000 or 2,000 yuan, until it reached 6,000 yuan, which was decided the night before. The results were: Gu Lanjun, first place, 6,000 yuan. (Purchased by a Dashanren from Shen Da Foreign Firm) Chen Yunshang, second place, 5,000 yuan. (Purchased by Mr. Ma from Puke Foreign Firm) Tong Yuejuan, third place, 300 yuan. (Purchased by Mr. Huo) The photos of the three ladies Jue Luming, Li Hong, and Zhou Xuan were sold for 100 yuan each. At the same time, a Dashanren gave the value to all of Gu Lanjun's photos in the entire venue and took them away. This competition can be said to be extremely fierce!</p>
<p>Sisters Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the exhibition was declared over. Mr. Lin Kanghou and Miss Gu Lanjun were invited to the venue to hold the closing award ceremony. Miss Gu arrived at the meeting with her sister Miss Lijun. The sisters were dressed in blue cloth cheongsams, a pair of beauties, simple and pleasant. After Mr. Lin met her, he praised her quickly: "Great hero", "Great hero". Some people say that the proceeds from this auction are no less than 20,000 yuan, which can greatly benefit the refugees. I hope that the organizers will complete the procedures for public announcement as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Lin Gu's Speech</p>
<p>At the closing ceremony, Mr. Lin Kanghou stood up and said, "I have lived to be sixty-four years old and have never heard that a photo can be worth 6,000 yuan, but this is indeed the current fact..." The words were interesting and funny, which was very amusing. Then Miss Gu gave a thank you speech, saying in a movie-like Mandarin voice: "I am ashamed, I am too busy filming and have not done much to help the refugees; here I would like to donate 100 yuan to express my feelings..." The attitude was very generous, and the wording was also appropriate, like Miss Hu Die's style back then.</p>
<p>Finally, Miss Gu awarded the photos to the purchasers, took pictures, and the meeting was adjourned, thus completing this charity sale.</p>

<h3>Stage and Screen (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xia Xia</p>
<p>— My Maiden Home and My Husband's Family</p>
<p>The play was over, and because business was good, there was a lot of surplus. Although I didn't get a penny, I got something more precious than money, that is, my confidence. This experience told me that as long as you are willing to endure hardship and work hard, there is nothing in the world that cannot be done. "Where there is a will, there is a way" has become my golden rule.</p>
<p>Later, I unexpectedly encountered a lot of exclusion, jealousy, bullying, slander and all kinds of intolerable blows. I thought about it for a long time, and I decided to seek another way. I didn't want to crouch at other people's feet waiting for pity, so I left the stage and jumped onto the screen, that is to say, I left my maiden's home and went to my husband's family—and had a relationship with my husband's family.</p>
<p>The above only tells about my relationship with the stage and the screen. Now let's talk about my current situation: Since August 13th, the entire China has taken on a new look. Everything is being reformed and everything is progressing. So when the film companies were closed last year, my maiden's family also revived with a new look after the reform, and wanted me to go back. Because of my long-standing love for the stage, and at the same time, I felt that I should also serve this group that is striving for the drama movement on this isolated island, so I forgot all the old grievances and came here without hesitation.</p>
<p>Later, the film companies slowly opened one after another. Xinhua Company wanted me to be a basic actor. Because I also liked my husband's family, I agreed without hesitation. However, I didn't completely leave my maiden's family like the last time. I just worked on both sides when they didn't conflict with each other, so sometimes I ran to the stage and sometimes I jumped on the screen, running around on both sides, from last year until now.</p>
<p>Finally, what should be said is my future hope! I feel that the acting life of Chinese actresses is really too short. If you want to engage in this kind of work for the rest of your life, it is impossible to rely solely on being an actor. Looking at the old actors who are declining and falling one after another is a very good example. So in order to implement my own ideas and regard filmmaking as a lifelong career, I have a plan to become a director. I plan to become a director when I can't be an actor, so that this lifelong career will not be interrupted halfway. Fortunately, I have always held the belief that "where there is a will, there is a way." As long as I continue to work hard and continue to learn, I think that with my obsession and confidence in filmmaking, I may not be rejected by my maiden's home and my husband's family, right?</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Difference Between Inviting Performers Now and in the Past</p>
<p>In the autocratic era, Confucius was exceptionally respected. Since the old master Confucius had a habit of not knowing the taste of meat for three months after hearing Shao music, his descendants also loved opera very much. Every year, some famous performers would come south from Beijing to Qufu to sing a few good operas for the little sage to enjoy. After receiving the reward, some would return to the capital, while others would go south from Qufu and then disperse to various provinces. However, the first large place to stop after leaving Qufu and heading south was our Xuzhou Prefecture. Since Xuzhou is a thoroughfare for four provinces, the commerce is naturally more prosperous, and there are several large-scale opera houses, so these good actors who were serving in the inner court were happy to stay here for a while to seek further development to the west or south. I don't remember the very distant years very well. Like the famous actors in the Lian Shengzhan and Wuchanhui opera houses in the city during the Guangxu years, such as Bai Meimao Wang Yufang, Xu Chunfa, Song Jian, and the later generation of Yidiyou, Xiao Guangzi, Tian Shuanglin, Wang Baoan, Dong Delin, Sun Chunquan, Wang Caiyun, Bolicui, Yinwawa, all these Sheng, Dan, Jing, and famous actors from Bangzi and Erhuang troupes were all exceptionally skilled and capable. Later, Mr. Yufang and his son Xiao Pang Gou (i.e. Wang Wenxiang) came to Shanghai to teach apprentices. Wenxiang also joined the troupe because Xu Chunfa was the backstage manager of the Lao Gong stage. Wang Caiyun was originally a Qinqiang Hua Dan, and his martial arts were very strong. Because of his old age and declining appearance, he changed his name to Liu Fengkui, and is now the backstage manager of a stage in this city. As for the others, they have either died or retired, and most of them have disappeared. After the Republic of China, such as Rui Debao, Liu Kuiguan, Wang Yunfang, and Wang Guanying, all of them performed in Xuzhou first and then came directly to Shanghai. Furthermore, such as Zhou Xinfang, the famous president of the Qi Society, although his ancestral home is Ningbo, he lived in Xuzhou City with his father for a long time since he was a child. It is said that Xinfang's father was originally an amateur opera performer and loved opera very much, but because of his Southern accent, his pronunciation was inaccurate and his art was mediocre, so every time he sang, he would mess it up. Zhou was angry and ordered Xinfang to enter the opera school to learn opera. Now he has become famous, which can also be considered a way for his father to be proud. (72)</p>
