<h3>中國勝利與各國在華利益</h3>
<p>「中國抗戰勝利，則國勢鼎盛，頭角崢嶸，各國在華利益，屆時不將為中國朝野所排擠乎？」</p>
<p>試問友邦人士，不懷此鬼胎而憂疑之甚乎？前據日本東京報紙傳稱，上海英籍鉅商沙遜爵士遨遊海外，返滬經日本時，曾語日本記者，謂中國抗戰勝利，則英國在華利益有受威脅之虞云云；竊疑此人未必作此說，前晚沙遜氏到上海，或舉以詢其究竟，果予否認。溯目中日交戰，在華外商旣備受日本欺壓，損失已多，憤懣之甚；同時却又憂疑於其在中國勝利後之遭遇。沙遜氏否認傳說，然如此憂疑者，大有人在。抑不僅在華之外國商界人士，如此憂疑而已；日本方面久以此為離間鼓煽之資，以尼國際之聲援中國；故各國之二三流政家報人，遂不無受其給者，乃亦惘然曰，中國若戰勝，有可憂疑焉云。或有論者，且以為德義祖日而外，復有國家，不欲制日；彼非有愛於日，惟虞中國抬頭而彼蒙其不利；國際對遠東之趦趄觀望，形成遠東黯澹之局面者，亦以上述憂疑為之祟云。</p>
<p>雖然，觀察國際最近之對華情態，業已改變其歷年所取之口惠政策，而自實際上相機為中國援助。若蘇俄之供給軍火，始終不輟，是無論矣。國際聯盟會暨會內外各國，自技術醫藥救濟諸方面助華者，囊槖於途，項背相望，是旣具見其對華同情心之深厚，顧非有利害觀念參雜其間者也。若乃緬甸與安南之竭力發展其對華交通路綫，英美兩國之一再貸予中國以鉅欵，此則决非徒事委蛇，聊相慰藉之比，確亦大有裨於中國之抗戰者也。似此情態，在中國方面，雖必感念友邦，但亦當然不以此為心滿意足；在英美諸國方面，雖旣有所作為，但亦當然未可遽謂已竭能事；所可吿慰者，諸國對遠東之政策，未嘗以上述憂疑而蒙其惡劣影響，此則目前之國際情態可為佐證者也。</p>
<p>憂疑如彼，情况若此，其間無何因果關係，固矣；顧為杜絕離間計，為助長各國朝野之定心與定力計，為增進各國與中國之互信，並穩定中國與各國之道義基礎計，實有廓淸此類憂疑之必要。如何廓清？誠使追求憂疑之由來，必知其來歷不明而付之一笑。誠使縷析構成憂疑之因素，亦必知其為錯覺，為誤聽誤信，為脆弱幼穉，不値多所駁斥。竊以為最須理解，亦最應置信者，莫若三端：中國地大物博，除少數都市，沾染現代氣息，略具現代規模而外，其他廣漠之區域，仿之十入世紀之歐洲一般狀况，尙有不及；有待開發，有待建設者，即使空談，亦難盡罄，况乃絕無假借，絕無捷徑之事功；故戰勝日本之後，雖竭全國之力量，一以當十，急起直追，殆亦非經半世紀之時間，豈能粗具規模。乃謂舍此遠大而不圖，僅羨各國在華之戔戔成就，區區利益，而不惜出之以攘奪與排擠，此屬必無之理，必無之事。即就所謂少數都市言之，經此戰事破壤，亦復滿目瘡痍；即此恢復舊觀，亦須十年廿年，若欲步武歐美現代都市，相差尤遠矣；此固戰後中國朝野之最亟，而不欲枝節橫生，以求之於各國在華利益者。此其一也。抑無論為復興都市，為開發農村，以中國目前之人力物力而論，事功艱期；蓋全國之活動資力有限，是不可諱也。夫不計時間而僅及空間，則亦已矣；不然，求其簡捷，求其事半功倍，確非獲得友邦資助不可，資本然，技術尤然。然則謂可一面排擠各國現有之利益，一面吸收國外之人力物力歟？惟為事理所不許，故為中國所不取。此其二也。自抗戰以迄今茲，時閱二十月有餘，其間各國態度，有足使中國失望者，更有足使中國憤懣者。事已過去，茲不多述。若循憤懣之途徑，則中國人必以對日抗戰之精神，對抗一切；而記者本文，亦屬虛偽之言辭，絕無取信於各國朝野之餘地。今乃並不如此，各國旣改變其口惠政策，而求援華之實際，中國亦以獲得實惠而體諒各國；自此而後，中國與各國之間，樹立道義之基礎；夫以中國之民族性，以中國之舊信仰，謂將怨以報德，而謀不利於各國之在華利益者，此尤必無之事，必無之理也。此其三也。尤如英國議會之中，有大聲疾呼者曰，中國之抗戰，乃為保全英國之在華利益而戰者也。如是云云，接近實事；中國雖不以如是云云而得更偉大更切實之慰藉，然獲知英國方面乃有明鑒及此者，，是旣忻然矣！中國空軍曾飛往日本之上空，不投炸彈，僅散傳單而歸；是可以代表中國之道義觀念者矣。</p>
<p>惟此種種，可於各國對華抗戰獲勝後所抱之憂疑，一掃而空歟！是記者所跂望者也。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）據此間官方今日宜稱、此次英國以巨款貸與中國、足以帮助華方穩定幣制、並可對於日本企圖在華北及上海减貶華幣價値之行動予以抵制、政府方面相信、日方雖然企圖破壞中國幣制、而華方此次所得貸款、巳足穩定華元價値至無限期矣、且英方此次貸款、除足以穩定華方幣制外、亦足以增進中國國際貿易云、（九日美聯社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）陸相倍利厦頃向下院提出一九三九—四〇年度陸軍預算案、為數共一六一·一三三·〇〇〇鎊、並發表演說、說明英國陸軍狀况、尤注重陸軍須在必要時開往歐洲大陸參戰一事、其言有曰、「政府已决定加緊訓練後備軍、配以新式軍械、俾他日歐洲大陸發生戰事時、得以有備無患、」其時英國之後備軍與正規軍當立即合併、但全部陸軍未能同時開抵交戰地點、而當分批派往歐洲大陸」、至以英國陸軍實力而論、現有（一）正規軍六師、內分步兵四師·鐵甲師二師、（二）後備軍十二師、內分步兵九師·摩托化部隊二師·鐵甲師一師、（三）騎兵獨立旅兩旅、暨旅以下之獨立部隊若干、全數當在十九師以上、</p>
<p>以員額而論、除印度緬甸駐軍不計外、共有各級官兵五三一·三五三名、較諸一年之前約增加八三·〇〇〇名、本屆財政年度以內、尙須添募正規軍新兵四〇·〇〇〇名、以言空防部隊、已由兩個單位增至五個單位、尙當賡續增加至七個單位、各單位所有之高射砲數目、當在下屆財政年度內增加百分之五十乃至百分之百、所需全部經費約三〇·〇〇〇鎊、</p>
<p>此外、政府為防止本部陸軍實力减削起見、决將海外各地駐軍員額予以充實、俾他日戰事開始時、各該屬地駐軍均能以有效手段充分自衛、例如瑪爾泰島·希潑萊斯島·錫蘭島·新加坡港各地駐軍、均當添寡土著兵、即以香港而論、亦當添募中國籍與印度籍士兵共一·〇〇〇名、此外、政府曾在去年一年中、致力於本部軍隊機械化一項工作、正規軍步兵四師員額之半、已可以原有之交通工具同時移動、後備軍機械化設備亦巳予以革新、並配以新式軍械、「已故陸相哈爾台恩勛爵（卒於一九二八年、曾於一九〇五年任陸相）嘗欲編成正規軍步兵六師·兵一師·時至此日、吾國巳有陸軍十九師强、哈爾台恩勒爵在職時、後備兵在裝備上、足以應付歐洲大陸戰事者尙付闕如、現在之後備軍則巳配備新式軍械、以今視昔、可謂已有極大的進步」、</p>

<p>（倫敦）相倍利厦所發表之演說、頃由此問政界人士加以評論云、倍利厦陸相嘗謂英國於必要時、須將陸軍開往歐洲大陸、從事作戰、政府當局公開作此表示、當以此為嚆矢、至謂英國之後備軍與正規軍、當在戰時立即合併為一、尤足見英國將來如何應援法國、已製有切實方案、據各軍事專家之觀察、英國在必要時所當開往法國之軍隊、共分兩部、（一）在開戰後立即開拔者、計有摩托化部隊三師、（二）在開戰後立即開始訓練然後陸續開拔者、計有後備軍數師團、至倍利厦陸相所由發出此項聲明者、厥因英國軍火工業自加緊生產以還、業已大著成效、且所製軍械、均係最新式、惟此有備無患、爰作鮮明表示、以見英國準備應付戰爭輿維護和平同具决心、此在國內無分政府與反對派業已一致加以贊許、而在法德義三國所可引起之反響、亦必重大云（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>東戰場自日人席捲京滬杭三角地帶，華東據錢塘江南岸堅守以來，相持已一年有餘。這其間，日人最初因為戰略關係，最後為了實力不夠，使這方面的戰事入於半眠狀態；華方則乘機整軍經武，生聚教訓，宛若勾踐自姑胥台畔被釋歸來時的越國，當時越國國境，北起海監南達姑末（衝縣），東至勾通甬（東海），西迄槜李（嘉興），這縱橫八百里的領土，也和現在第Ｘ戰區在浙江方面的陣地和游擊區域相當·而日方的情形，和華方的對策，更和范蠡對勾踐所說：「謀國破敵，動觀其符，今吳乘諸侯之威，以號令天下，不知德薄而恩淺，道狹而怨廣，權懸而智衰，力竭而威折，兵剉而軍退，七散而眾解。臣請按師整兵，待其敗壞，隨而襲之，兵不血刃，十不旋踵，吳之君臣為虜矣，臣願大王匿聲，無見其動，以觀其靜」，不謀而合·當筆者在桂林訪晤浙江省政府主席黃紹竑氏，暢談浙江省政後，對於這種史實，益感興奮。</p>
<p>越王勾踐的臥薪嘗膽，深謀積慮，雖是滅吳復國的原因之一，但他假如沒有「明而知內」的范蠡，和「遠而見外」的文種兩位重臣，給他在政治上以英大的臂助，那麼吳王夫差，是否會對他「肉袒膝行」的問題，恐誰都難下肯定的答覆。因此爭取政治上的勝利，實在是獲得軍事上的勝利的先決條件，浙江遠處日人後方，雖有被日人包圍攻擊的危險，卻也有奮起突擊，一舉成功的便利。黃紹竑氏昔主內政，今掌浙符，他的苦幹實幹的精神，久為各方屬目。從他的談話中，不僅可以瞭然於浙江的現狀，且可求得前途的徵兆。</p>
<p>浙省政治是隨著局勢的演變而進展的，目下省政向著（一）自衛動員，（二）兵役，　財政動員，（三）改良農村機構，（四）物產調整，（五）交通統制等六項目標前進，「自衛動員」就是發動武裝民眾，使民眾自動武裝自己，在消極方面保衛村鎮縣區，積極方面直接參加民族解放的戰爭，現在浙江除村鎮各縣自衛武力外，每縣區有自衛團，且已能集中使用，雖然因此不免稍增人民的負擔，卻獲得大眾的了解。這種龐大的民眾武力，在未來的大反攻中，是掃蕩摧拉的急先鋒。</p>
<p>財政動員的口號，是「有錢出錢」，但並不一定叫某人出錢。浙江的富庶之區在嘉湖杭富，自先後陷落後，這淪陷的十三個縣份，雖僅及全省七十五個縣份的六分之一弱，在浙江的財政預算上，不能不說是一個甚大的損失。經過一度整理，如肅清中飽，加增消費稅率等，財政收入，反較原有收入增加達五分之一，因此，浙江有歷年度從未超過三千萬元的預算，今年度已一躍而突破四千萬元。這一財政上的奇蹟足以給各省財政當局一個示範。同時告訴中國人：中國的財政並不是「沒辦法」，而是「沒法辦」而已。</p>
<p>最值得注意的是「改良農村機構」這一項工作，浙江省區縣各組政府現都附設有「政治工作指導室」。訓練大學或中學畢業的青年，從事對民眾進行宣傳，解釋和推進政府法令的工作·他們的地位是處於政府和民眾之間，作為政府和民眾的媒介·目下在全省各區縣工作的，不下四千餘人，平均浙江每一萬人民中，便有政治工作人員二人·他們的工作，原則是「集中運用」和「分區負責」，每月工作三星期，訓練一星期，也就是在不斷的學習，工作，實騐和改良，可以說是一種最好的教育方法和工作方法了。溫州海口，日方尚未能封鎖，現為沿海貿易及交通的唯一孔道。從上海經此轉浙贛路輸入內地的日用品非常擁擠，過去雖免無日貨在　改裝牌號。運內地漁利者，現自溫州至金華之間，設有專司檢查此項日貨的關卡七處，如有發現，即予以沒收。</p>
<h3>徐州滿目凄涼　偽員粉墨登場　徐南匪勢猖獗</h3>
<p>徐州通訊、徐州原為銅山蕭縣兩縣合併、故辖地甚廣、踞津浦·隴海之要衝、歷來為軍事重鎮、自去歲淪陷、受災之慘、不下京鎮等處、至今市況蕭條、大同街公明街為全縣繁榮之區、各大商店鱗次櫛比、現則一片焦土、南關·馬市街略有市面、大都以小飯店雜貨鋪為多、捲煙絕跡、民眾多吸土煙、私貨到處充斥、軍用票及華中聯合銀行之銀票、則到處飛舞、但人民均拒用、朝鮮銀行近且在徐設辦事處、日人策動之徐州偽治安維持會、徐屬各縣維持會、亦歸其節制、旋即改組為偽徐泗特區專員、廢歷元旦、正式成立偽省署駐徐辦事處、偽處長李海春、秘書長王祥林、民政科長蘇格念、財政科長張麗光、文教科長周至也、建設科長劉箴吾、參議曹子慶、徐州市政政府偽市長張雲生、參事楊石蘭秘書長徐惠伯、第一科長王稼生、第二科長由張自兼、市府下設四局、偽警察局長楊世緒、另有財政工務兩局財政局局長尚未有人、又劃出設立銅山縣公署、偽知事為李海春、由王劭清·張慰如充偽科長、政警隊長張桂山、徐州保衛總團長謝壽山、偽司法機關、本有徐州民事審判所、現亦改為偽銅山縣法院、偽院長為王銳生、一般大小傀儡、均彈冠相慶、偽區公署及鄉鎮公所、亦均成立、民眾苦於偽政府之搜刮壓迫、日處於水深火熱之中、無法重見天日、徐蕭交界以及徐南一帶之徐樓、青石山、　村等大小三十村莊、匪患異常猖獗、偽保衛團人數雖有三四千人、但槍械窮陋、不敢出城勦匪、</p>

<h3>陳禮江談　過去一年中國敎育（一）　文化界厄運雖不堪回首　新敎育復興已有望將來</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）敎部社會敎育司司長陳禮江氏、頃承談及過去一年的中國敎育、對於年來中國敎育被侵略者種種摧殘情形、與敎部對於戰後革新敎育之種種計劃及實施事項、言之綦詳、茲錄於下、（以下皆陳氏語）</p>
<p>過去一年的中國、是在繼承反抗暴敵侵略的嗣爭、而且更英勇更堅毅地鬥爭、在這樣一種際過的中國、一切的一切、都是在急激的變化、因而她的敎育、也一樣莫能例外、</p>
<p>從敵人破壞我們敎育的方面來看、這一年的中國敎育、眞是慘不忍覩、又慘不忍言、這一年、在我們的大後方、敵人本其過去一貫的很毒政策、天天有飛機狂炸、敎育文化機關、照例是牠轟炸的主要目標之一、轟炸的地區、不但華中的敎育文化機關如武昌華中大學等被炸、而且華南的敎育文化機關、如國立中山大學等也被炸、不但沿海的敎育文化機關如厦門大學等被炸、而且中部的敎育文化機關如湖南大學等也被炸、不但鄰近戰區的敎育文化機關被炸、而且遠在我國西南邊陲如雲南昆華師範也被炸、轟炸的手段、比了上年更兇殘、例如湖南大學的被炸、是以二十七架飛機、分三隊侵入嶽麓山上空密集投彈達四五十枚、中多燒夷彈、致湖南大學圖書館全部毀滅、科學館毀三分之二、學生宿舍毀三楝、殘存者只敗壁破垣、全校精華付之一炬、一校損失如是、集華中以至華南、沿海以至中部、戰區以至邊陲各文化機關、所受的損失、又豈可以計量、</p>
<p>遠離戰區的後方的敎育、文化機關、尙且遭到敵人如此瘋狂的轟炸、則這一年鄰近戰區以及戰區內的敎育文化機關、其被摧殘的程度之深與鉅、更不難想見、尤其是在我們為了戰略上的關係、不得不自動放棄某一個據點時、當地的敎育、更為所摧毀無遺、或者是把學校放一把火、如杭州監務中學等、都給它們燒個精光、或者是把圖書放一把火、如浙江省立圖書館等、都給它們焚燬無餘、或者是屠殺我學校敎員學生、如天津耀華中學校長趙天麟的遇害、上海滬江大學校長劉湛恩為暴徒狙擊斃命、不過是其顯例、其他為報紙上所未記載、我們所未知道被屠殺的知識份子、更是不可以數計、校舍之幸而未為敵人放火燒去者、亦為敵人據作軍營、如國立北京大學各院及宿舍等、據報都成敵人的馬廐與軍營、圖書儀器之幸而未為敵人放火燒去者、亦為敵人偷運回國、或幾個銅元一袋賣給店鋪作皮包、或則隨意當柴燒、至於我戰區中退出之敎員學生、其沿途所受風霜飢寒之苦、流離失所、失學失敎、均非可以言語形容、</p>
<p>然而創痛之深鉅、更有在轟炸摧殘燒殺之上者、就是在淪陷區內實施毒辣無比的奴化敎育、轟炸不怕舊的燬了、又會長新的出來、摧殘不怕、愈摧殘、我們會變得更强壯更堅實、可是、奴化敎育、却可怕、太可怕了、它是殺人不見血的東西、一個中華民族的兒女、受了奴化敎育的迷惑與麻醉、就完了、不但完了，而且還會做敵人的牛馬、做敵人的走狗、他再聽不到祖國的呼喚、再不知道自已民族的歷史、認賊作父、為虎作倀、而不自知、一個民族、在軍事上為他人征服、還不怕、到了在敎育上文化上也為他人征服、只有人為刀俎、我為魚肉、敵人在我淪陷區、已經開始做這個工作、舉例以言、上年四月四日各報載、敵在我淪陷區內、對我國兒童、除屠戮外、並俘歸敎養、為將來繼續侵略之準備、敵更異想天開、調派前駐奧公使谷正之到滬、主辦媽化敎育、就地設敎、免携去豢養之勞、據北平通訊報吿文化古城的故事、及天津通訊報吿鐵蹄下的華北奴化敎育、言之可慘、歸納敵人在淪陷區實施奴化敎育的步驟、第一步是搜查、（北平國立文化機關）第二步是焚燬並取締我有關民族意識之各種書報、並屠戮我知識分子、第三步是招集我知識分子中的敗類、（例如敵偽招搖在上海新聞報登載平津各校院上海聯合辦事處啟事、登記平津流亡在滬各校院員生之類）、並加以漢奸理論的訓練、第四步是修改敎科書及課程、將我原有敎科書中關於三民主義民族思想的敎材、盡行刪去、提倡麻醉性質的讀經、又列倭國語文為必修科、第五步乃改設學校、招集學生施行奴化敎育、除此之外、還提倡軟化麻醉性質的所「中華佛敎會」、創辦各式各樣的漢奸報紙、壓迫外僑在華設立之學校、施行「王道樂土」「東亞新秩序」的荒謬宣傳、並剝奪我淪陷區民衆出版集會結社等等自由、跡敵人的用心、無非是想運用奴化敎育的工具、來消滅黃帝子孫的民族意識、敎一個個黃帝子孫、澈頭澈尾的做日帝國主義的順民、不、做牛、做馬、做奴隸、並且要你當砲灰去殺自己的弟兄、</p>
<p>總括說一句、從敵人破壞方面來看、這一年的中國敎育，不但是大受日寇的破壞、創鉅痛深、而且是大受日寇的捉弄、驚心動魄、</p>
<p>從我們創建方面來看、這一年的中國敎靑、卻是最堪讃賞又最足令人興奪中國過去的敎育、目的不明、方針不定、理論龐雜、思想紛歧、然而在這一年之中、這些毛病、便完全改變過來了、論敎育目的、不分朝野、已一致朝向為民族國家陶鑄抗戰建國的忠勇戰士、一面抗戰、一面建國、論敎育方針、則陳部長巳一再宣示、三育務要並進、文武必須合一、農工並重、敎育目的與政治目的一貫、家庭敎育、與學校敎育密切聯繫、對於吾國固有文化精粹所寄之文史哲藝、以科學方法、加以整理發揚、以立民族之自信、對於自然科學、依據需要、迎頭趕上、以應國防與生產之急需、對於社會科學、取人之長、補己之短、以求一切適台於國情、對於各級學校敎育、力求目標之明顯、並謀各地平均之發展、對於義務敎育、依照原定期限、以達普及、對於社會敎育、與家庭敎育、力求有計畫之實施、而抗戰建國綱領、更有下列各條之規定（二十九）改訂敎育制度及推行戰時敎程、注重於國民道德之修養、提高科學的研究、與擴充其設備、（三十）訓練各種專門技術人員、與以適當之分配、以應抗戰需要（三十一）訓練靑年、俾能服務於戰區及農村、（三十二）訓練婦女、俾能服務社會事業、以增抗戰力量、根據此種方針、以中國國民黨臨時全國代表大會、並通過了一個戰時各級敎育實施方案綱要（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　因匯兌平準基金設立　外匯又起劇烈賣見</h3>
<p>外銀行出口商頻塞不已　「華北偽銀行」亦來斬多</p>
<p>匯市昨因當日報載中英金融借款計劃已成立、故而又引起劇烈賣風、外電香港及西商沙遜並華商紗花帮等勇猛大景塞出、且「華北準備銀行」亦來猛烈斬多、加以外商銀行界納胃不旺、故而鬆勞頗銳、唯中途會因西商沙遜忽止塞力吸、故形勢一度回緊、卒以求不敵供、終難久持、終則英美兩匯續見鬆動、交易殊暢、至港匯因外商銀行及出口商等亦猛力拋塞、且洋行納胃不健、故而鬆勢亦厲、且出五十五元關、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均平、紐約銀價及倫敦生金亦無升降、匯兌英對美縮一厘二、對法小三生丁、對滬長〇六二五、美對英跌一二五、對法大〇六二五、對滬漲一角五分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價英匯八辦士二一八七五、美匯十六元〇六二五、較之前收、英美兩匯均無榮辱、開後因西商沙遜暨外電香港及華商紗花帮等爭先傾向拋塞、兼銀行納胄不佳、故而潛勢鬆賤頗厲、沙遜港電紗花帮賣予麥加利匯豐有利某行英金由八辦士二五、做硬至三一二五、繼之沙遜外電華商亦售予匯豐有利某行美匯由十六元一八七五、步賤至二五、匯豐掛牌及白銀平衡稅揭曉、均無更動、此後西商沙遜突止塞猛扒、故為狀亦反動轉緊、沙遜購結外銀行英金由八辦士八一二五回至二一八七五、兼美匯從十六元一八七五、回緊至〇六二五、嗣後外電香港復來拋塞、故乃重復鬆賤、港電賣予匯豐英金八辦士二八一二五、後外電亦塞予匯豐某行美匯址六元一八七五、近午外行安達亦售予洋行港匯九十五元一二五、是以過程亦硬、午收銀行賣價英匯八辦士二八一二五、美匯十六元一八七五、</p>
<p>後市港電續來拋塞、加以天津帮（「華北聯銀」等虧本忍痛斬出、）與華行亦爭先力售、故潛勢更形鬆濫、華行香港大津帮售予匯豐荷蘭安達英金由八辦士三一二五、長至三四三七五、繼之洋行結進匯豐英金八辦士三二五、兼扒結外銀行美匯十六元二五、後華商紗花帮又售予華行美匯十六元三一二五、最後華行又吸進出口商港匯五十五元七五、是以為狀仍鬆、晚收銀行賣價英金八辦士三四三七五、美匯十六元三一二五、結果較之前收英鬆一二五、美硬二五、港匯亦鬆一元、達五十五元七五、</p>

<p>昨本市現金烚赤暗盤市况、風浪復巨、跌風突又轉熾、傾瀉勢如破竹、竟再接連退入二千一百卅元至二千一百元四重大關內、一度曾跌至二千〇九十元最低價、較上週六之二千二百元空前高峯、竟較小一百十元有奇、乃在各路客帮吸胄滯呆之際、英美經濟援華更見積極、中英貸款業巳成立、金融旣益鞏固、外匯經北帮（內有聯銀）與中西投機家斬多下、連日劇鬆、現金多頭當然無味、故經某金號傾售於前、前日下午代富商猛進之錢兌業軋多繼後、中途雖見證券帮與銀樓業及錢兌業買進、均係獲利復進、非賤價不要、致金價更一蹶不振、終再狂跌卅七元、人心極疲、交易日旺、上下午約在一千兩以上、市勢復稍帶混亂、首飾金步低三元、關金等一致未更、</p>
<p>烚赤跌得慘</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開因聞外匯鬆勢頗厲、故而人心益疲、賣戶蜂湧、而進者奇缺、價遂破入二十元關內、首由某金號售予錢兌業百兩、及銀樓帮五十兩、均二千一百十五元為開盤價、較之前收做低廿元、開後外匯忽止鬆轉緊、人心頓被激動、買風漸濃、價即回升、銀樓帮進現金號五十兩價十六元、某錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩十八元、另一錢兌業進金號五十兩、價廿元、繼之錢兌業又進銀樓帮五十兩、價廿四元、某錢兌業相同價進證券帮五十兩、此後價突然復向下游、蓋外匯重趨鬆勢、賣者又見蓬勃、證券帮賣予錢兌業五十兩、為廿一元、錢兌業互做五十兩、價十九元、錢兌業售予證券帮百兩、價十四元及十二元、此後某金號又來猛塞、破入十元關內金號售予證券帮五十兩、價〇八元、後又售予銀樓帮五十兩、十元為午收價、午後初開尙平、首由銀樓帮進錢兌業五十兩、價十元、機之錢兌業進金號五十兩、十一元、此後外匯續報鬆賤、致進者又懷觀望、價乃猛跌、錢兌業賣予銀樓帮五十兩〇五元、嗣後賣戶更湧、不惜賤價脫售、破入百元大關、某錢兌業售予金號五十兩二千〇九十元為當日之最低盤、後金號續來吸購、故遂回升、金號進錢兌業五十兩、價九十六元、最後又進錢兌業五十兩、二千〇九十八元為晚收價、結果較上日軋跌卅七元、（已連跌四天、共計九十二元）聞收後某錢兌業忽想吸購、遂抬高至百元關外、喊〇二元買進、但仍難獲對手、致未做開、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百〇五元、收進二千〇九十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元、金號均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金小三元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至九時五十四分、因烚赤初開即做低廿元光景、故亦隨之掛小一元、後至下午二時五十五分、因烚赤潛勢更疲、故又掛小一元、後又至三時廿七分、因烚赤破入百元大關、故再掛小一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸百十三元、新同行亦改懸二百十一元、收進二百〇五元、</p>
<p>英純金不動</p>
<p>七日倫教電、英純金每盎司復趨呆定、仍屬七鎊八先令二辦士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦仍為一千二百〇九元九角、掛牌海關金亦未更動、仍計二元三角九分二厘、上海標準標金價亦未更、仍計一千二百〇五元二角、</p>
<h3>英印銀價無榮辱</h3>

<h3>貼現率站定</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、（每千元）勢仍呆定、上午四十七元七角半、下午即回上為四十八元、與前日價相同、</p>
<h3>外滙有國際保障　外幣乃反動劇跌</h3>
<p>昨日英純金未動、英美匯兌降一二五、外匯自借款成立後、人心極度虛弱、洋行結款意感稀少、沙遜等奮力拋塞、銀行納量呆滯、外電供給源源不絕、市價步步鬆動、勢甚堅硬、烚赤隨匯票鬆動、金號銀樓業等紛起出籠、天津帮因津埠金價較昂、有利可圖、趁低吸納、故一度回漲、無如匯票鬆動不已、維持困難、法幣有國際保證、黃金投機時期巳少、投資公債、為獲利捷徑、故粉紛拋塞、套進法幣、金價復趨下跌、勢甚軟弱、外幣受匯票鬆動、金價下跌影響、勢難立足、殷富拋塞頻仍、買者愈見稀少、跌風之下、無敢收藏、各幣除貨款應用外、無大宗需要、致市價齊趨下降、反動劇烈、為抗戰來所僅見、公會交易减少、勤泰出永泰進美金票五百元、盈豐出、永泰進美金鎊五十個、永泰出鴻昌進英金鎊五十個、勤泰出承泰進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金鎊降六角、英金票降五角五分、美金鎊降五角、美金票降一角二分、香港票降三分四厘、法郎票降二厘半、新加坡票降三分、荷蘭票降五分、安南票降五分、羅比票降三分、坎拿大票降一角、斐律濱票降五分、澳金票降一元一角、僅義大利票德金票暹邏票無交易未更動、</p>

<p>昨日經過、開盤即因大豐竭力收買、聞代革銀行吸收、先後約有六十萬之多、市價逐步上騰、丙種再衝出九元、後已逼近五址元大關、旋以卅五號多頭出籠、曾一度回小四五角、但以天生潤利茂大等進胃仍濃、大豐續有加碼、洽豐號賣出雖多、價仍未可遏止、復行回上三四角、人心極為良好、午收比前已好起八角一元左右、午後開盤、大豐號吸胃仍濃、二十號需要亦極股、餘如十五號以及茂大號均有相當買進、賣方以信豐永多頭出籠、五號及同康聯和等號稍有賣出、檯面已見求過於供、市價仍極堅定、丙種再見四十九元九角、逼近五十元大關、收盤形勢優美、當為抗戰以來所僅見、市價結果、一致再漲九角半至一元一角不等、成交總數約有一百五十萬元之多、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　投機移注細紗　綫價突跳七元　二十支紗反跌二三元</h3>
<p>紗市始漲繼平、趨勢依然和緩、良以實需益覺淸閒、各帮仍無生氣、同業多數意見看漲、故價低時又來吸收拖進幾包、市况復轉上漲、價高之後、有人又來賣出、籌碼稍鬆、卽趨下挫、根本問題、因實際交易太缺、故買方心思雖然濃烈、仍難鞏固也、大勢目前尙不脫盤旋徘徊之境、惟細紗綫價因多方利用季節關係、拉提做作尤烈、每日成交、同行佔多數、故漲勢尤熾、在三四日中已激漲至三四十元之譜、一旦實需稍滯、則反動亦劇烈、亦不可不防也、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、市塲人氣仍呆定、惟三十二支·四十二支細紗綫客方仍求問詢、市價即跳五元、四十二支猫蝶開價為五百五十三元、現鈔價、比上日加五元至七元、少頃三十二支天女亦漲七元、為五百三十七元、廿支雙馬紗開價為四百〇三元、與上日無甚軒輊、棧單價為四百元零零五角、繼聞實銷不旺、又復回挫、二十支雙馬現貨價為四百零二元、棧單做至三百九十八元、午後氣勢略形平疲、實需亦稀、二十支雙馬回跌二元、做到四百元、棧單價為三百九十七元半、結果查全日各帮買去統計一千四百四十包、行情二十支雙馬比上日跌二元半、天女跌三元、惟三十二支·四十二支仍漲五元至七元、廠方由新裕廠開出二十支雙地球四百三十包、價三百九十九元半至四百元、又十支雙地球二百包、價為二百九十七元半至九十八元、今日出口棉紗有七百件運天津、一百二十件運福州、二百七十五件運寗波、茲將各帮口買去現紗之額量列左、</p>

<h3>原棉高貴　廠辦轉弱</h3>
<p>本棉生意愈形沉寂、蓋以價格太高、廠方無意採辦、同時細紗綫價雖節節前進、然二十支紗價　見衰弱、於此廠家對於高貴之原料、亦無意多辦、然存底單薄、故雖有不良環境籠罩、然市價尙難鬆懈、但據一部份消息、外棉塊角下跌、換算價每擔比上日要跌一元以外、各廠購訂外棉補充之念尤濃、至於到貨一層、至月底邊恐有擁到希望、姚花到八千六百包、茲將現棉成交之額量並市槃列左、</p>
<p>印棉不斷運來、茲聞大英公司Alipore號、由孟買運來棉花六千六百四十餘噸、合計二萬八千餘件、預計下星期一（十三日）可抵滬、均係日商所採辦、另有一千餘噸、原輪運往日本起　云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　重磅粗布　市盤續堅　本埠存底旣空虛　大生廠來源又斷</h3>
<p>國布各貨市盤、互有軒輊、白貨華廠十四磅十六磅粗布、近因現銷甚暢、更以南通大生廠被迫停工、來源斷絕、滬埠存底空虛、故市盤續挺、各脾每疋漲五分至一角、輕磅粗布勢仍平定、永安廠大鵬細布浙贛帮需求殷切、現貨缺乏、昨開價十三元、較前突漲一角半、砲車富貴等牌漲五分、浙贛帮辦胃較宏、成交細布·細料·粗布·漂布·府綢等貨三百數十件、粵帮辦十六磅地球粗布·各廠粗斜·細斜一百五六十包、閩省福州洋口沙縣諸地、當令貨需要亦漸開展、滇帮裝貨漸繁、躉位尙感不敷、成都帮購額亦細瑣、</p>

<h3>匯票長花價跌　外棉有巨額做開</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初開盤即形疲乏、市上盛傳華盛頓有提早放出貸款棉之消息、因之市上竟無買戶、南方在市套賣、及多頭了結頗烈、因之市價猛跌十一至十五磅音、印度前數日係暗盤行市、故市價參差不齊、自昨日交易所正式開拍、市况業已納人正軌、昨日印度猛跌二羅比、埃及跌三五磅音、昨日因借款成功、匯兌猛放、近期先令八便士半、美金十六元二五、羅比四十六元半、折合法幣、棉價俱跌二三元、計美棉及巴西棉每担跌二元一角、印棉每担跌二元三角至二元六角、埃及跌三元餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因外棉價格猛跌、較之本棉殊為合算、故昨日交易殊形熱鬧、尤以印棉為最、數日來申新廠購買印棉已有萬餘包、當購辦之時、適為印棉交易所停板聲中、市價未能納入正軌、該時棉價適為近六月來之頂高峰、聞訂下巨額交易、共約五萬餘担、前昨日棉價猛跌、每担共約三四元、茲將咋日外棉交易件額及外棉折合送廠價、分列於後、</p>
<p>（一）成交額</p>

<h3>糧食　粳米多數到限價　昨有大批白米運滬　為農歷新春來第一遭　癖數有一萬四千餘包　洋米已在交易談判中</h3>
<p>杜米各帮來源漸夥、河下到七號、輪車包子七八千包、而人心尙昂、本街及囤戶去胃尙屬活絡、所以形勞復緊、續見混沌、結果厚薄粳較高貨、又開十四元、中段貨則較加二三角、杜洋尖情形相同、悉為十四元、埠尖則開十三元五六角至十三元八角、相較亦已增起三角、白元價格乏變、而眼光帶混、中次已難分淸　、</p>
<p>秈米本客囤戶去化均旺、統市成交又有七八千包、行情叉昂二三角不等、蕪秈已開至十三元二角、高京秈喊至十三元半、洋米昨開出數百包、西貢已至十六元半、洋行定貨雖未接近、而雙方已在接洽中、近期外費十七元三角、而連費則近十八元、此價殊不易接近、惟行囤存底不豐、因此更擬居奇、以待善價云、</p>
<p>自晨歷新年以來、食米來源斷絕、據米商云、內地存米尙多、因日偽之苛稅太重、不勝負担、以致米商裹足、本市雖尙有存貨、惟恐有缺乏之憾、因之近日米價、逐漸上升、米業同業公會、特通吿限價等情、無如各米都已開至限價、記者得悉、昨晨太古洋行蕪湖輪進口、自滸浦裝來白米一萬四千零四十九包、此為新年來第一次進口、想米價可以不平而自平矣、</p>
<h3>洋粉廉價傾銷</h3>
<p>粉市明定暗鬆、客帮零星去化尙不寂寞、但因洋粉零批絡繹而至、廉價傾銷聲中、本粉前途頗受影響、故粉價於無形中漸趨混亂狀態、昨據廠商消息、連日廠盤幾分三種、表面上迄未鬆動、而實據暗盤本街仍須四元七角牛、南洋帮四元七角、北洋帮方面特價僅四元六角半、統市南北帮各辦一萬餘包、本街方面、因本客廠盤參差不一、交易不多、「又訊」洋粉市價步見鬆落、已與本粉售價相等、三四月份期貨更屬廉宜、僅售美金二元五角、合計每包僅四元、昨本街成交二三千包、照此環境、麵粉市塲、巳被外貸侵奪殆盡矣、今日有一萬二千包粉運福州、一千包運天津、又麩皮二百包運福州、一千包運寗波、</p>

<h3>政府借款一千萬英鎊　充匯兌平準基金　此後法幣外匯益趨鞏固穩定　上海黑市匯兌業已一致轉鬆</h3>
<p>我國政府、自統制外滙成功之後、法幣現余準備充足、法定滙價、始終維持、黑市塲之外滙、亦予穩定、今向涯豐·麥加利·中國·交通·等四行、成立匯兌平準基金借款一千萬英鎊、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>統制外匯成功以後</p>
<p>財政部於去年三月十四日起、實施外匯統制、規定各銀行因正當用途、於收付相抵後、需用外滙、得向中央銀行申請、旨在打破偽「聯合準備銀行」鈔票、掉換法幣、套取外滙、及籍此以管理進口所需之外匯、以求國際貿易之平衡、利用外匯出售之限制、節制國內資金之逃避、此外並頒佈商人運貨出口及售結外滙辦法、實施促進土貨輸出、以充實外滙基金、規定外滙法價英滙一先令二辨士半、美滙三十美元、自此以後、外匯穩定、商人减少許多無謂損失、進出口貿易、逐漸呈欣欣向榮之現象、</p>
<p>維持法價穩定黑市</p>
<p>抗戰以來、農工商各業、巳蒙受極度之摧殘、戰區各省民生之困難、巳逮極點、後方各省、因交通受阻、運輸維艱金融之周轉、物資之供求、均日見艱困、政府深鑒於此、决以全力維持法幣信用、欲維持法幣信用、首先穩定外滙、所以抗戰迄今、法定匯價、始終如一、至於上海黑市塲外滙、亦與英商滙豐銀行合作穩定、統制外幣政策及維持法幣信用、巳得中外人士之信仰和稱讚、法幣之發行、戰後雖已增加、現金準備、反見提高、與法幣發行條例、完全符合、每月檢査公吿、以昭大信、</p>
<p>借千萬鎊充作基金</p>
<p>今為維持法弊信用穩定外滙商業交易、使匯兌有合理之穩固、决撥一千萬英鎊、為穩定法幣之基金、業經與英國政府及英商匯豐·麥加利·兩銀行、我口之中國·交通·兩銀行接洽妥當、由英商匯豐·麥加利·兩行及中國·交通·兩行·分別擔任貸借各五百萬英鎊、此項基金結束時、如受有任何損失、則由財政部負責賠償、關於滙豐·麥加例得·兩行之貸款、由英國政府予以保證、期限暫定為一年、期滿後如同意得延長若干時期、但必要時得提早償還結束、</p>
<p>上海黑市外匯轉鬆</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向上海外商銀行界控悉、自中國政府為穩定法幣維持外匯、向滙豐·麥加利·中國·交通·等四行、成立一千萬英鎊匯兌平準基金借款後、中外銀行界均認為此後中國之法幣和外匯、勢將愈趨鞏固穩定、於是上海黑市塲外進一致轉鬆、昨日英商滙豐銀行掛牌、英滙為八便士、美　為十五元六二五、但實際交易行市、英滙為八便士二五、美滙十六元一二五、因政府向滙豐麥加利等行借款成功、滙市有再鬆之趨勞、</p>

<h3>日在華北厲行　輸出統制　據稱將修改「稅率」　並施行「許可證制」</h3>

<h3>大生紗廠被迫停工　德領嚴重抗議　日商紡續公會討論集資收買　德商態度堅决不放棄營業權</h3>
<p>德簡露益吉洋行管理之南通海門大生第一三兩紗廠、近被日方封鎖厰門、勒令停工後、該洋行巳將經過情形、呈報駐滬德總領事、提出交涉、現悉日商在華紡績業公會、召集各日商紗廠、擬出資收買經營、茲經現代社記者探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>該廠歷史</p>
<p>大生紡織公司、先前計有第一·第二·第三·三廠、原由華商張賽等發起創立、其第一廠於遜清光緒二十年四月開設、廠址在南通唐家閘、資本計六百三十萬元、紗錠九二五二〇枚、綫錠二〇〇〇枚、布機五〇五台、男女工人七千餘名、又附屬於第一廠之副廠、於民國十三年十月間開辦、廠址設於南通南門外江家橋、資本一百五十萬元、紗錠一九五〇八枚、布機二四〇台、男女工人一千五百餘名、第二廠於遜淸光緒三十三年三月間開辦、廠址啟東久隆鎭南、（巳於戰前停閉）第三廠於民國十年九月間開辦、廠址海門長樂鎭南灣、資本四二〇萬元、紗錠三〇三〇〇枚、布機四四四台、男女工人二千餘名、該兩廠歷史悠久、設備宏偉、在華商紡織業中是有相當地位、其所出品孔雀·魁星·龍鳳·雙龍·獅子等各種商標之紗綫、行銷全國、在戰前係由徐靜仁為董事長、負責主持、該兩廠之資本完全由國內商業鉅子籌資創辦辦、絕無外資投入、其公積金亦逐年增加、計第一廠二七〇·〇〇〇元、第二廠八五·二〇〇元、</p>
<p>拖欠外債</p>
<p>當該兩廠創立後、業務方面、於民國十七八年時、為全盛時代、迨後日商在滬紗廠林立、極事擴充、競爭企圖壓倒華商厰家、該兩廠亦埋頭建設、改良出品、並向國外訂購機器、銳意經營、表面雖仍趨安定、惟實際上已受重大之打擊、流動資金、漸見减少、直至「八一三」滬戰爆發、該兩廠已呈外强中乾之勢、向德商靄益吉洋行購買之機器款、虧負甚鉅、致該廠當局、一因環境副迫、二因所負外債、無法淸理、故不惜將此具有數十年苦心擘劃之事業、堕落於外人之手、當中日戰爭初期、德商為保全自身權益起見、曾派德籟職員請求駐滬德軍開駐一小隊於廠內、作為保護、迨後沿江各縣淪陷、戰事西移、滬上日商紗廠相繼恢復開工、以是該行遂行整理復工、迄今年餘、</p>
<p>日方覬覦</p>
<p>自大生第一第三兩廠由德商靄益吉洋行管理開工後、日方大為不滿、原欲攫取該廠營業權、曾無從實現、惟處心積慮、仍使用各種方法、希圖破壞、初藉軍事名義、派駐海軍陸戰隊五百餘人、分駐在南區一廠海門三廠內、並在廠內二三樓關為留守營房、頂層置設瞭望哨台、架有機關槍等、將廠內工作之女工任意調笑姦汚、男工則被征工役搬儲彈藥及挖掘防禦工事等、如男工工餘返家、至次日進廠時、指為游擊隊、即予逮捕槍殺、或經廠方證明後釋放、凡此種種、使廠方營業、不能自由、在去年十月間、日方曾提出合作條件、經德商拒絕、以致延擱以來、近將半年、日方又復舊事重提、亦未獲結果、故日方突於本月二日取斷然手段、將該廠封鎖、並由駐防南通之軍特務機關長濱本宗三郎、出示佈吿、勒令停工、所有留在廠內工作之男女工人、悉被驅逐、廠房四週、均派有日軍多名、駐紮留守、</p>
<p>德領抗議</p>
<p>日方突將該兩廠用武力壓迫停H後、德商靄益吉洋行認為日方非法封鎖工廠、妨害營業、根據駐廠人員之報吿呈請駐德領事、提出嚴重抗議、俾早日開工、並要求賠償損失、現此事正由德領向日方交涉中、又據現代社記者探悉、日商在華紡織業公會、於本星期初曾召集在滬各紡織廠主腦人員會議、討論收買大生紗廠事件、記者詢諸關係方面、則稱德商態度、頗為堅决、决不因非法阻撓、而放秦槯益、故該項爭端前途、尙難逆料、</p>
<h3>葡商海龍輪　被日檢查　在浙椒江口外　旅客飽受虛驚</h3>
<p>葡商大西洋航業公司、行駛上海溫州綫之海龍輪、三月六日、由溫州裝貨搭客駛滬、於七日晚六時許、駛至椒江口外時、為巡弋浙洋之日艦、用旗號阻止行駛、由日艦派小汽艇載日兵登輪、施行檢査、因滬溫航綫各輪向駛外面、今該輪突走裏面、於是引起日艦之懷疑、結果一無所獲、直至八日晨、始行釋放、照常駛滬、該輸前晚抵滬後、卽向公司報吿、昨已照常裝貨、搭客駛溫、該輪旅客、則已飽受虛驚、聞該輸此次由溫駛滬、改走裏面之原因、因裏面航程、較外面為近、</p>
<h3>日本獨覇在華航業　英國深受影響　壟斷華北海運統制內河小輪　拒絕開放長江阻撓各國航運</h3>
<p>自日艦封鎖我國沿海各口岸後、國營民營船隻被迫停航、日本欲獨霸在華航業、如統制華中內河小輸、壟斷華北海運、計劃開航南洋綫、拒絕開放長江珠江、英美各國在華航業、均受影響、茲詰詳情如下、</p>
<p>在華航運英佔第一</p>
<p>在中國沿海及內河航業、以英國航運勢力佔第一位、如一九三六年英日美三國、在中國各港入口之船隻及噸數、英國四八·一五四隻、五七·三四五·五一五噸、日本一七·九一一隻、二四·九一三·五七六噸、美國三·九七三隻、三·七七一·四七九噸、則證明英國在華航運力量、較日本多上二倍、但自戰事發生後、情形大變、一九三七年英國船舶在中國出入、减少一二·八三一隻、二一·二三九·七二〇噸、</p>
<p>戰後日本企圖獨覇</p>
<p>戰後英·美·德·意·葡·希·巴·各國航商、收買華輪、竭力擴充在華航業、但日本企圖獨霸在華航運、如拒絕開放長江及珠江、阻撓外輪行駛蘇北阜寗浙東海門、無理扣留及檢查外輸、同時在華北利用特殊勢力、壟斷海運、華中方面、日巳將英國地位、取而代之、華中內河小輸、由日統制、獨家經營、此外除開航上海厦門航綫外、並計劃開闢上海香港間之南洋航班、</p>
<p>英國航業大受影響</p>
<p>自一九三八年秋季起、日在華航運、突吿猛進、英美各國在華航業、均受極大影響、如去年日本在華各港進出船隻、已增至五·四七三隻、六·四八四·六二〇噸、佔第二位、今年一月、日為四七八隻、七五九·八八九噸、而英為三〇四隻、八四〇·三〇二噸、隻數較日减少、噸位與日相差無幾、則足證英在華航業逐漸退步、而日在華航業逐漸進展、顯係受日本獨覇在華航業之影響、</p>
<p>大連日淸擴充航運</p>
<p>日本在華航業、華北海運、由大連汽船會社統制、長江下游、由日淸公司獨航、江浙內河、由內河輪船公司壟斷、今日清公司為擴充在華航業、除非法沒收華商各輪外、已新造一千噸以上之江海新輸、加入沿海及長江中下游航綫、日本軍事當局、予以種種便利、日本政府、發給航業補助費、今滬崇綫·滬通綫·滬揚綫、均由日清公司派輸行駛、第三國船舶、均被阻止、同時聞日本欲在香港附近、設一近代港口、則今日香港海運、亦將陷於絕境、</p>
<h3>恢復　安徽郵務　暫以平信快信　掛號三種為限</h3>
<p>安徽省全區郵務、前因戰事關係、以致停頓、各局郵務人員、奉令來滬、在滬設安徽郵政管理局駐滬臨時辦事處、繼續辦理郵務後、迄今半載有餘、茲全部人員、業於上月初旬、先後離滬赴皖、進行恢復各區郵局郵務、並將安徽郵鳥駐滬辦事處撒消、至於各種重要文件、亦運往應用、新聲社記者、昨向上海郵政管理局探悉、關於安徽全省郵務、自於去冬籌備恢復以還、迄已四月、茲該省地方情形、已稍趨平靜、居民亦皆遷還原處、該省郵政管理局、為便利民間通訊起見、已將地方平靜區域、如安慶（懷寗）·懷遠·永城·合肥·宜城·舒城·廣濟·陽新·等區郵務、業於本月起、相繼恢復、惟暫以平信·快信·掛號·三種為限、包裏·匯兌、卒因交通阻滯、仍難恢復、至於運輸辦法、及封發時間、均有詳細規定、又悉寄往四川省小包郵件、於昨日起停止收寄、並發出通吿云、「自即日起、寄往四川省之各項小包郵件、一律暫停收寄、特此通吿」、</p>

<h3>經米業市場勸導　每日運滬米糧約五六千包　日偽擬徵苛稅經力爭取消</h3>
<p>滬市米價、經市場竭力壓制、已漸趨平穩、各帮客商、相繼恢復販運、每日由水陸兩路到滬米糧約五六千包、日偽擬增米稅案、經內地米商抗爭後、未能實行、茲經現代社記者探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>各帮客商　恢復販運</p>
<p>米業市場、遵照豆米行業同業公會議决案、嚴厲執行限價及壓制囤戶及客帮操縱、市價巳趨正常化、常熟、無錫·崑山·松江·嘉舆·張堰·同里·八坼等各帮客商、經市場管理委昌合剴切勸導結果、已相繼恢復販運、同時滬上各米行號直接向內地採購之米糧、亦派員赴產地各行、辦理運滬手續、</p>
<p>運滬米糧　漸見增加</p>
<p>據現代社記者昨向本埠各幫運米客商團體調查、近日由內地運滬米糧、每日約有五六千包、务數均係火車装來、而長江外輪裝運及內河民船直接裝滬者、負數甚少據稱、該項米糧、大部份係滬上各米行米店販商等於廢歷年底前所預購、連日因氣候陰雨、運輸麻煩、至天晴時、內地來源當更可增加、</p>
<p>日偽苛稅　力爭取消</p>
<p>日偽方面、為羅掘經濟、巧立名目、增征各項苛『捐』雜『稅』而尤以米糧一項、每石增征『落地稅』五角、原擬於三月一日起實行、旋經內地米商、以事關影響民食、特聯合同業向日偽『機關』抗爭結果、業已取消、至於日偽非法實行之『搬出稅』及『搬進稅』兩項、照常征收、</p>
<h3>游擊隊迭獲　匪軍槍械　張妙根下落不明　日哨兵每夜撤退</h3>

<h3>浙東棉花運滬　三千餘包　係華商紗廠自用</h3>
<p>浙東存棉最近奉財政部電令、重行禁運來滬，其前已由商會發給證明書者、仍准裝運、兹本市租界内勤豐·新裕·信和·恊記·統益·鸿章·等紗廠、經由甯波商會證明、兩批装運棉花三千八百五十五包來滬、供給本廠自用、</p>

<h3>公共租界實行　搜查街頭婦女　女檢查員昨執行職務　目的在防範夾帶軍器</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、昨（八日）據公共租界警務處高級人員聲稱、女檢查員從今日起、將會同巡捕搜查隊、在中區舆西區檢查、聞女檢查員</p>
<p>二十四人　昨日已實現其職務、此舉可表明租界加强對付恐怖份子與持械罪犯運動之另一步驟、女檢查員十二人、自清晨起、即在西區活動、地豐路大西路只愚園路一帶．搜查尤嚴、中區內另有十二人、會同巡捕隊、在外灘忙碌從事、檢查自各輸船與渡船登陸之婦女、彼等且登電車與公共汽車、施行檢查、街頭搜查婦女、在上海乃</p>
<p>罕有之事　蓋向來對於女嫌疑犯、均俟带入就近捕房後、始加搜查、但鑒於婦女常携帶屬於罪犯之槍械、與其他軍器、故成立街頭搜查制度、此乃公共租界對付恐怖份子運動之一部分、日本海軍啃兵、常檢查越蘇州河各橋而入虹口之華人、男婦均施搜查、惟公共租界地位稍有不同、故工部局决定調女檢查員赴各捕房、隨街頭搜查隊出外檢查、俾較妥善　此項新辦法之結果、昨日尚未正式透露，然縱使尚未確切查獲軍器等物、而此後由彼等會同巡捕檢查，以及巡捕由白俄商團為助、而常赴各旅館與各區搜查、將證明其為目下運動中之重要因素，可預卜也、</p>
<h3>浦東新聲日軍　又遭重大損失　遊擊隊一度衝破外圍　日軍竟拆斷橋樑困守</h3>
<p>浦東新塲鎭、現在成爲游擊隊與日軍之戰塲、曾相持二十餘日、日軍慘敗者五次、雙方憑二日、日軍慘敗者五次、雙方憑二灶港對峙、乃至前晚（七日）下午十時許、游擊隊向日軍爲烈之衝鋒、日軍大潰、游擊隊衝破日軍外圍防綫、日軍負　於王家花園司令部、以小鋼砲重機關槍溢射、和千發之多、阻止華軍前進、但華軍指揮者、均親冒鋒鏑、向前挺進、日軍情急、將新塲之大河橋樑、完全炸斷、故游擊隊被阻於河東遂隔河引誘日軍、消耗大量藥彈、至八日淸晨五時、凡七小時之射擊、日軍損失藥彈、當在萬發以上、是役殲滅日軍十餘人、</p>

<p>國醫與食養症勢危急出入生死　疔瘡必須忌口  丁伯安　　疔毒乃外科中之急性病，初起時如瘖子大，頂上有一小白皰，微覺麻木發癢，此時人多忽視，待病勢轉劇，數小時內，高腫漫疼，痛不可忍。來勢之迅速，為其他病症所無。倘療治不得其法，每有走黃之變，有喪命於旦夕間者。　　根據以往經騐，疔毒走黃之原因，大致有二：一因誤用針砭。一為誤食葷腥油膩食物。「疔頭碰鐵頭，」這句話卽是說疔毒本身腫處，不可施用刀針砭刺，用之有引起走黃之可能。惟於病者背部，視有紅點，刺之出血，則能疏泄熱毒，减輕病勢。若為紅絲疔，則可於紅絲游走頭上，刀砭出血，斷其蔓延之路，俾免疔毒攻心。食物方面，如猪肉，蝦，蟹，鷄，鴨，酒等，具有刺激散發之作用，食之易使疔毒散佈，由血分而危害心臟，敗壞血液，致成走黃。故起病之初，宜謹守戒律，庶免發生意外。青菜，醬瓜，大頭菜，蘿蔔乾等素肴，於病無碍，不妨用以佐餐。口內乾渴者，多飮菊花露，金銀花露，能淸熱解毒。盛行一時之鸕鶿咳  朱作三　　今春氣候不常，時氣所染，小兒頓咳，發現頗多；頓咳或稱百日欬，鸕鶿欬，麻雀咳。初時亦係感受風寒引起，邪東肺表，咳嗽微熱，涕淚噴嚏，一星期後，咳嗆頓作，短促急劇，有特異之氣管支痙攣性狀，不能少息，面顏青紅，致頭胸亦必向前傾俯，必待惡心嘔吐，吐出食物與大量痰涎後，始得安靜片時。故治療之法，古方有鸕鶿咳丸（藥舖有售，每日空腹時硏碎一丸，開水或杏仁熬湯送服。）輕性者可以有效，重者則較難。大致初起時當以宣肺為主，繼則必從降氣，加入疎肝淸火，以弛緩神經之痙攣。此症通常須歷三月左右，始可痊愈，但在經過期中，有足以致　者：蓋咳嗆劇甚，易於震破血管，大量咯血；故須特加注意。又病見嘔吐旣多，營養必感不足，故飮食中最忌甜膩與酸辣刺激之物，若食後即吐，應即另給飮食，以維持其營養。日常飮料，可用麻黃杏酪湯（光杏仁百粒，水浸敲碎，榨汁，人麻黃二三分，加冰糖少許，煮沸去麻黃飮之，）或批杷葉湯（枇杷葉刷毛凈盡，微炒煎湯）代茶，俾收利肺化痰之效。更有進者，此症身熱頗少，可毋須避風，且應常處新鮮空氣中，而使呼吸暢通。腦膜炎之預防  嚴蒼山　　西醫之腦獲炎，盯中醫之痙病也。痙病發為時疫，故又簡稱疫痙。每値春令，流行甚盛。此病患者多為少壯血虛及陽旺者，老年人在所僅見。與小兒之病多驚風，理無二致。且多係剛痙無汗，重者朝不保夕。去冬霜雪稀少，今春寒氣逼人，氣候反常，如遇腦瞙炎流行之際，故將歷經試用有效之預防法，開列於後：　　（一）杞菊地黃丸，每服四錢，空心淡盬湯下。（二）二至丸，每服三錢，空心淡鹽湯下。（三）甘菊花，綠茶葉泡濃，令有苦味代茶。（四）菉荳，煮粥，闔家每日各服一碗。（五）黑芝蔴，盬炒佐饌。（六）青橄欖，每日食十數枚。（七）白萊　，不論生熟均可多吃。猪肉之屬  吳達候　　豬肉味甘腴，性寒，體健胃强無病者食之，能潤腸胃，生津液，助氣力，肥健壯旺，頗得食養之益。四腿最美，肋條次之，頭有毒，不宜多食。醉豬南腿，病後宜食之。　　食豬肉，瘦人內熱者宜多食白煮，胃無熱者宜多食紅燒或油煎；然多食則則生濕痰，引風熱，凡胃弱不能尅化，及傷寒，瘧疾，疔癐損傷，槍彈傷者，皆不可食。　　豬脚補中氣，滑肌膚，去寒熱，婦人乳汁不行，同木通煮食卽行。腰子即豬腎，性冷，和腎氣，利膀胱，補虛勞，消積滯；然久食亦損眞氣。肚卽豬胃，性微溫，大補中氣，血滯氣弱之人，及孕婦九個月，並宜食之。陽臟，補下焦虛竭，去大小腸風熱，止小便數，止渴肺，微寒，補肺，陰虛內熱乾欬吐血，調養頗宜。肝性溫，補血治冷泄，脚氣水腫，肝熱目赤諸　。閒話飮酒  袁山　　有人以為飮酒是一件不良的事，然而不能一槪而論，酒飮得少些，有疏行血脈，通和經絡之功，如果呑服藥丸等物，用酒送下，更可助長藥力發揮。飮得多，有時醉了就難免闖禍，那當然是不行的。　　其實酒的本身並沒有傷害人的意思，乃是人自己沒有主意的緣故。俗語說得好：「酒不醉人人自醉」，眞是一些不錯的。　　總之，要飮酒，應該做酒的主人，不可讓酒來做我們的主人；換一句話來說，要飮酒，自己要有節制才對！飮食討論（一）  秦伯未　　一，水與茶　飮所以解渴，而於平時健康，病中調養，有密切關係。先言水，今人率以白開水為飮，取其氣味甘平，清潔陽胃，絕無激刺，且能助陽氣以發汗，行經絡而利溲。惟海水味鹹，井水性寒，當以河水為佳。次言茶，茶葉為吾國特產。亦為國人普通之飮料，大別有二：綠茶係採後焙去其苦汁即可泡飮，紅茶乃蒸窖　酵而製成。其餘俱因產地，製法，培植，採取之不同而異其名稱。性質苦甘微寒，含有咖啡，鹼，揮發油，單寗酸等成分，具消食，滌痰，清火，醒睡之能。對於暑穢，痧氣，宿食初起，殊多效力，惟過濃則易刺激神經。然為時亦甚暫耳。據日本大阪市立衛生試騐所報吿：茶內含有偉大之殺菌力，以之治虎列拉，赤痢諸病，甚見功效，因細菌中之蛋白質，遇茶中多量之單寗酸，卽被吸收結合而停止其生活，與石灰之製成普通消毒劑完全不同，而自成一種獨特新異之殺菌法。觀此，茶之利釜正多，且可預防傳染疾病。　　二，西洋參　西洋參泡代茶飮，極為普遍，治肺胃有火，口燥咽乾，頗奏捷效。惟世俗震於參之美名，視為補品，則殊大謬。考西洋參性質苦寒，微甘，清肺之力獨勝，即能生津潤燥，仍屬泄熱所致，故胃弱津枯而不因實熱者，嫌伐生生之氣，不可不知也。　　三，石斛　石斛甘平，養眞陰，除虛熱，能促進胃液，以助消化，亦能激腸蠕動及制止其吸收力，以排泄積糞，而使體溫低降。故溫熱病垂愈期內，煎泡作飮，用為健胃强壯藥甚佳。惟品類棊繁，大概川石斛以鐵皮石斛為最，皮色深綠，質地堅實，生嚼之脂膏粘舌，味原微甘。霍山石斛以綠毛風斛最優，色呈淡綠，質柔而軟，蓋僅擷極嫩之尖，故乾之而不槁，嚼之而無滓，味厚而富脂膏。洵上品也。　　四，菊花　菊花種類最多，產地亦廣，泡飮以杭菊為佳。味苦甘，性平而香，功能袪風除熱清肝，凡頭痛目赤眩暈等症，極屬相宜。內熱重者，可於綠茶中入二三朶長飮之。食養識小錄小兒閒食致病  張汝偉　　小兒踼胃薄弱，消化易感不良，若進食過多過雜，腸胃即易失常，如多食糖果，則胃酸，多食糕餅，則腹脹；油膩水果並進，則泄瀉。凡兒童面色萎黃，見食自厭，粥飯少進，手足心熱，時常哭吵，大腹時痛者，即是『閒食病』。若再感受外邪，往往促成疳積·肺炎·咳嗆·痧疹等。預防之法；（一）宜少食，停止雜食；（二）家長第一注意，不可因無外感寒熱，强小兒多食；（三）宜略進開水泡水果，以促陽胃之自然消化，所謂有備則無患也。預防風寒濕痺  劉民叔　　烏頭有田種與野生之分。野生奢名草烏頭，田種者名川烏頭；草烏性烈而有毒，川烏則否，故能治沉疴痼疾。民叔常用烏頭粥作晨點，可治風寒濕痺麻木不仁。未病者，一旬一服，可以預防；已病者日日服之，可供治療。方用生川烏一斤，硏為細末，每用一錢至二錢，病重者可酌加至四錢，和粳米半升，慢火同煮，粥勿過稠，加生薑汁一茶匙，白蜜三湯匙，攪勻空腹啜之；服之日久，輕身健行。猪肚可治遺精  安　　用猪肚一個，擦凈油膩，將蓮子半斤去心，留肉，入猪肚內蒸爛，用酒時時煮食，遺精可愈。此方並能兼治白濁之症。羊肝使目復明  陳佐雷　　取羊肝一個去脂膜，切薄，加水少許，乾煮而食之，（以空腹時為佳）不過旬日，昏花之目，卽可復明。常服亦妙牛骨髓之製法  張三思　　世人僅知牛肉汁牛乳，為補身妙品，而不知牛骨髓之補力，實較牛肉汁牛乳有過無不及。牛骨髓功能健胃，强身，增血，補腎，惟識者不多，故售價極廉。此物獨食，頗難入口，又易變味，故宜製粉藏之　　製粉之法，只須以薏仁米及粳米磨細後，再用文火同炒，俟骨髓完全吸入粉內為止。若再拌入白糖少許，則香甜可口，百食不厭。凡身體孱弱，脾胃不弱，腎虧貧血，及精神不振者，常服此物，必可精神飽滿，却病延年。談談家常食品　薑葱油鹽酒醋  張贊臣　　生薑　生薑為食餌菜饌中常用之品，吾人喜辛辣物者，惟比最有益．故論語云：「每食不撤薑。」言可常食，但實不宜多，病家尤應注意。薑味辛而性微溫，功能散寒發表，止嘔，開胃，行滯。故諺云：「上牀蘿蔔下牀薑。」蓋晚食蘿蔔，則可消酒食之滯，淸晨食薑，能開胃禦風寒也。薑汁可救暴卒，薑皮能治浮腫。乾薑治寒咳，薑炭溫肢寒。至於血滯身冷，胸腹氣痛，或敷或服，均有神效。惟孕歸及思瘡瘍者有時忌之。　　食鹽　食鹽為調和食物之要品，功能瀉火潤燥，淸心滋腎。內服少量，能增進胃液之分泌，助長消化。凡誤服鴉片及患乾霍亂者，用溫水化服多旦，使之嘔吐即愈。咽喉久病，用此欶之亦可。皮膚瘙養化水，洗之能止。手足抽搐而冷者，炒熱後用布包摩擦，筋絡得舒而愈。惟哮喘，消渴，水腫等證，俱大忌。　　酒醋　酒醋和血，行氣，壯膽，禦寒之品，溺凍縊死者，溫酒少許，飮之復蘇。跌打損傷，酒水名牛溫熱，洗之輒效。多服傷身，能生痰，動火而有害。醉者以綠豆扮，枳棋子，葛花，煎湯可解。　　醋味苦溫，多食能損脾胃。凡產後血暈，可用鐵秤錘一個，置炭火中燒紅，淬於醋中，以之薰鼻，則能復醒。塗敷癱腫，能消炎止痛，解魚肉毒亦佳。身熱大汗不止，蘸洗皮膚，令人身凉汗止。如咽喉腫痛，同蜜水調和漱之絕妙。　　葱　葱味辛而溫，專主發散：凡外感表邪，頭痛惡寒者，以葱曰一莖，生薑二片，泡湯服之，能疏通皮膚，使之汗出而解。　　油　油之種類甚多，惟菜油之陳者，火傷塗之，可稱良劑。一為蜂類昆蟲蛇蝎所嚙，以此油摩擦傷處，過時即愈。細蟲入耳，滴之立斃。荳油能治咯血不止，生油二杯緩服，血可漸止。按油性膩滯，能降火法以緩其勢，庶可再為設法。徵稿　　歡迎來稿　　（一）國醫常識，（二）食物治療，（三）食養知識，（四）揷畫。一經刋登，除食養識小錄外，槪致現金酬，稿寄申報館「國醫與食養」編輯部，惟不蓋章者作却酬論。　　何時希，朱振聲，鄒德民，何立三，張贊臣，胡祥麟，余香芸，朱作三，尤學周，謝也農，王介人，秦伯未，許錦濤，萬希文，丁濟華，張三思，張偉，劉民叔，曹錫萬，倪息庵，陳蔚蒼，諸君鑒：上月份稿費，巳經結出，請自本月十五日起蓋原章向本館會計處領取稿費。</p>

<p>自由談「報銷戰」  茂烈　　我們是消耗戰，消耗敵人的物力和人力；敵人是報銷戰，報銷他們自己的預算和决算。　　他們，軍閥，為了培植自己的勢力，不得不擴張軍備；為了擴張軍備，不得不有所籍口；為了有所藉口，乃不得不對外侵略，於是造成了「九一八」，「一二八」，以至「八一三」諸役。這就是他們的為報銷而戰。　　同樣，「八一三」以後，近乎二年的戰爭，他們不但一無所得，更加大有所失；但是他們旣巳筋疲力盡，却又欲罷不能，還是只好支持下去，敷衍下去，其最大的原因，照我看來，也無非在造報銷。不信，你看：自從武漢與廣州陷落，他們有了一篇大報銷以後，他們在做些什麼呢？假使說他們監决要征服中國的，為什麼又逡巡不前，一再求和呢？這是他們的前帳已清，要想吿一段落罷了。　　因此，不久以前，以至現在，他們的空軍濫炸我們西南和西北的各大城市，是他們的空軍在造報銷，海軍的砲轟我們合州定海等地，是海軍在造報銷，而最近鄂中和蘇北的戰事，當然也可以認清，是他們的陸軍在造報銷。否則他們最初的發動，本來已師出無名，最近的零碎作戰，以第三者的眼光看來，更其無聊透頂，早就可以不如其巳了，他們還在那裏瞎幹，蠻幹，謂非造報銷而何！　　有人還要疑惑我的說法麼？那末再請看前幾天他們議會中所通過的軍費預算，其總數是四十六萬萬。好大的數目！事前不有一些舉動，以示其必要，那裏能通得過呢？事後不有一些舉動，以示其用途，那裏能消化得了呢？　　一言以蔽之，他們，軍閥，無非要培植他們自己的勢力，因此他們的攻城略地，殺人放火，無非是報銷戰。　　我們非但不怕這種報銷戰，而且很歡迎牠，願意幫牠成功，因為我們的消耗戰，正要使他們達到報銷無可報銷，戰無可戰的地步。在後方（上）  無衣　　一　　「嗡嗡！嗡……」　　敵人的飛機來轟炸啦！兄弟們在排長的指揮下正捨命地向山坡上衝，只要衝入敵陣，行麼鳥飛機都不打緊。衝，捨命衡上去吧！肉搏一展開，眼見前面大勝嶺是敵人的墓地啦！衝呀！大勝嶺是咱們的！　　咦，奇怪，兩條腿子在壕裏伏麻啦，怎地跑不動起來嘞？他媽的死腿子，你不看見大勝嶺就在前面了麽？　　「睡着，不要動呀！」一個軟和的聲音輕輕地喚醒了咱的昏迷。張開眼，咱發覺自己躺在床上了，四周有一片呻吟聲，一位穿白衣服的小姐坐在咱床側。噢，咱在做夢，這裏是後方醫院嘞。外邊有飛機聲在響。　　嗨！那又奇了，好好兒把人家抬在醫院裏幹鳥的？於是咱大喊道：　　「你這小姑娘玩笑也不是這樣開法的，你不知道大勝嶺；嗨！只要再上前一步，大勝嶺就是咱們的。你把咱的性命寶貝兒（槍）拿到那裏去了，快拿來讓咱去，不然老子揍死你。」　　她却笑嘻嘻按住了咱的肩膀道：　　「老鄕，耐氣些，你受傷了呢。」　　「好，你還騙我，你，哼！你不知道衡大勝嶺共只三排兄弟麽？受什麽鳥傷，咱死也得死在大勝嶺去，你想把咱磨死在這兒麼？他媽的！」咱嚷着就想舉手推開她跑出外邊去。　　可是手還沒有舉起，骨子裹却格格格痛起來了，紅的血漬正從被她扶住了的那枝手膀的白布內滲出來，嗨！老子眞的掛了彩啦！這可活倒楣了！　　一個童子軍挾着份報紙在這邊走過，他輕聲問那位小姐　　「這兄弟是那兒來的，可是大勝領那仗上的？」　　「正是呀！你這位小弟弟吿訴我報上消息怎樣啦？有大勝嶺麽？快讀出來！」咱不管三七二十一搶着問。　　「唔，有的，是大題目呢！你聽着：血肉衝鋒，犧牲壯烈，第×師××部隊三排兄弟昨克要點大勝嶺。援軍續至，敵傷亡奇重，刻我軍在繼續挺進中。詳情請略等一會呌彭小姐給你讀吧！」　　他說過，舉手打了個禮，笑盈盈帶跳跑了。　　於是咱心上放下一副担子，不自禁地忘了臂上的創痛，顚過頭問那位小姐。　　「怎樣？」　　「老鄕眞會幹，」她微笑着說，「不過得安靜些，創纔會快快好全呢！」　　「是的，咱安靜些就是，你們忙呢，去看護別位兄弟吧！咱靜養好了下次冉幹會子你看看。」咱說。夜之訴  東號　　怯懦　　爬過山嶺，馳過郊原，渡過冰冷的河流，穿過陰暗的森林，背着沉重的包袱，走在那狹窄不平的河岸上。我低下了頭，讓冷風從我的雜亂的頭髮上掠過。水波輕微地打着石難，像幽靈的低訴。　　寒鴉在松林的頂上打轉，呀呀的呌聲響成一片。三艘，兩艘……，遠處的帆影終於完全在黑暗裏消滅；脫了葉的疏朗的樹枝，變成漆黑的一團。　　河面上披起闇闈的輕紗。大地又沉沉地安眠。黑色摟抱着山林，河岸，和水面。寒風好似受創的野牛，在天空迴旋呼號，像在驚擾着牠們的安眠。遠村的犬吠得好緊，聲聲打進我的心。　　前面是一條小河。靜靜地，躺在這兒，像一條死蛇。一片狹小的木板鋪着，這是橋。　　右邊是茫茫的大河，墨黑的天空。左邊林莽中飛出尖銳的風聲：那荒落敗頹的墓墟上的枯草，被狂風吹得颼颼響，……這一切描畫出孕育着暴風雨的夜空。我筆直的站着在這橋邊，凝望着遠方，好像一個邊疆上的戍人。　　終於，我的心房跳動加劇，脚也跟着顫抖起來。於是，我不自覺的坐下來，頽廢地，恐懼地，像一匹疲的野獸。　　星空　　狂風掀起我的長衣，冷流直鑽進我的胸膛，急忙把包袱壓在身上。犬吠得更響更緊，風聲還在悽厲地呼嘯。　　「昨晚，寒星佈滿了夜空；月光，照着大地靜靜的安眠。而今夜，烏黑的雲廥滿蓋着天際。這可怕的黑夜啊！」　　夜的原野上飄起陣陣的低唱，是誰家兒女在苦悶的高壓下發出呼聲？飄，飄向天邊，最後淹沒在狂風裏。　　然而，接着來的是洪大的吼聲：　　「我們需要光明，需要晴空！讓黑暗快些死滅！大膽地前進吧！像一個英勇的戰士。去尋求那風霆後的空明！」　　山嶺間，叢林裏，石灘的隙縫中，吼聲響在每一個角落。像洪鐘，像獅吼。任狂風呼嘯，總蓋沒不了它。　　我霍地站起來，像做惡夢後醒來，心底在激動。是上帝的指示，還是夜鶯的高歌，吿訴我一條坦途？我穩定了我的脚跟，抑制着動盪的心潮，拿起包袱，身子傴僂着，用輕快，愉悅，勇敢的步調，走過橋來。　　夜路在我的面前展開。我毫不猶豫地向前，心底裏樹着一座光明的燈塔。　　風勢更加猛厲起來了，然而不久便和緩下來。蒼鬱的松林裏還有風聲在微嘯，天空的風雲在飛馳。　　月亮已經露出她的臉蛋。濃厚的雲層，還想掙扎。强烈的光輝和雲層在不斷交戰。在那亮光照澈了的河岸上，我踏着地上的樹技的黑影，望着黑雲逐漸地消滅。　　滿天繁星，照在林莽，荒墳，河岸和水面，一片光明！我歡呼，我頂禮，向着星空。成則為王「燒冷竈」與「打落水狗」  莫邪　　一樣是失意的人，有的被人當為「冷竃」，不時「燒」之，有的被人當為「落水狗」，羣起「打」之，正可謂有幸有不幸了。　　「竈」就是「狗」，「狗」就是「竈」，二而一，一而二，「燒」者「打」者，究竟有無法眼，加以鑑別，我不得而知。不過有一點我却是知道的，就是「燒」者也會「打」，「打」者也會「燒」，二者可兼，正像善「吹」者善「抬」，善「拍」者善「吹」，那樣來得渾成。　　一般人總以燒冷竈楚陰功積德，雖然不見得一定會如韓信那樣的冷竈，有千金之報，究竟幫助失意落魄的可憐人，總是一件美事，只有打落水狗，眞所謂落阱下石，不足為訓，凡是稍存仁心，略以慈善為懷的，總不該有此一舉。於是社會上的看法，雖將「竈」與「狗」列於同等地位，却將「燒」者和「打」者，變作了兩等人，予以另眼看待；善「燒」奢有慈善家之美名，善「打」者乃多刻薄鬼之惡謚。　　然而在我仔細想來，「竈」亦有不應「燒」，而「狗」亦有不能不「打」者。恐怕說來太抽象，難於明白，不妨舉例以明之。　　「黨紀先生」一變而為「三不主義者」，蟄居河內，本身又成了這樣的「竈」或「狗」。——所謂又成了，是因為他已經幾次三番榮任這樣的「竈」或「狗」過。——假使有人要去「燒」他，豈不是增長他的惡勢力？作算你去「燒」了，他因而「旺」起來，將來算還你的「薪」價是很可觀的，可是一朝勢成燎原，爆裂起來，其如天下蒼生何！這樣的「冷竈」，我以為不應燒，應讓牠淸水蓋了鍋頭，冷塌，冷壞，方是上上大吉　　援「竈」就是「狗」的前提，他現在也正是落在「河內」之「狗」。據傳，他並不見得死心塌地，以「水」為家，頗有爬上岸來之意。而他的「爪牙」，的確也在活動，想要促成他的「上岸」運動。他一上岸來，誰又保得定他不成為「瘋狗」，為害人羣呢？那末，現在他還在「河內」，沒有「上岸」，此時不打，更待何時！　　因此，燒「冷火山」般的冷竈，算不得做好事，正是做壞事；同樣，打「瘋狗」般的落水狗，算不得做壞事，正是做好事。今之「燒者」「打者」，還須三思之。　　所謂「燒」「打」得兼，也有一個道理在內。蓋二者的目的，大都未必出於利他，而出於利己。他想被燒者一朝飛黃騰達，他就可以得到奥援，而被打的，當然是與他有妨礙的人，一打而使之不起，他從此可以高枕無憂了。所以這樣的人，旣會「燒」，也會「打」。　　同樣，出於正義感的「烧」與「打」，使好人發旺而壞人落水，也有相反相成之妙，所以「燒」與「打」，是可以萃於一身的。　　也許有人要問問我個人對於這事的態度，則我可以說，我很羨慕「不因人熱」的粱伯鸞，「熱竈」還不要燒，「冷竈」云乎哉！我也很羨慕除三害的周孝侯，大丈夫射南山虎，斬長橋蚊耳，「落水狗」云乎哉！中篇小說烽火中  周燕　　九　引狼入室　　獨眼李逃回了苕溪鎭，又驚又怒。他是個沒有知識的鹽梟土匪，根本未嘗受過敎育，更談不到什麼民族國家意識，經勃這番敎訓以後，不但不思悔過自新，反而痛惜他手下的謀士蕭麻子的死亡，把葉團長恨得什麼似的。　　他的隊伍原本是蝙蝠式的烏合之衆，平時就和某方暗通聲氣，這時受了這一塲他所認為的奇恥大辱，更沒有什麼顧忌，居然公開的向某方通款，表示投降，希望借某方的力量，來和葉團長拚個你死我活。　　經過往返的幾次接洽，就在葉團長請宴以後的一星期，某方便開始派人到苕溪鎭上來點騐收編獨眼李的部隊。這使苕溪鎭上大大的起了一番騷動。原來獨眼李的手下雖多不法之徒，却也不乏深明大義的人，尤共是地方上的壯丁，都不願在敵人的統治下做奴隸。不過他們自知力量有限，只好採取消極的抵抗辦法，紛紛携械或徒手逃亡到合浦鎭和其他的地方去，使獨眼李在交出部隊來時，感到人數不足的恐慌。獨眼李為了博得某方的信仰起見，竟用拉夫的方式，硬拉民衆來補充，作他投降的進獻。　　幸而也給他朦混了過去，於是，苕溪鎭便被某方兵不血刃的佔領了。獨眼李更向某方的宣撫班長獻計，誇說合浦鎭怎樣的富庶，要他們和他聯合進攻。某方的宣撫班長對有「小上海」之稱的合浦鎭，雖也非常垂涎，但因震於葉團長「死守國防綫」的聲名，知道他的實力很强，不敢貿然發動，只呌獨眼李隨時留心，遇有可乘之機，再行下手。　　葉國長聽說獨眼李公然降敵，非常憤怒，梁團附朱參謀和各大隊長等，也都一致要求他聲罪致討。不過他却顧慮到獨眼李剛和某方結合，其勢方銳，未可輕除，想等某方的兵力單薄時，再行各個擊破，所以只把部隊重新配備了一下，採取一種攻勢防禦的佈置，又召集民衆，作了一次訓話，呌他們隨時都作必要的準備，以便萬一形勢發生變化時，可以很快的隨軍撤退。（二九）</p>

<p>春秋上海兒童保育會  （席夢）　　兒童是我們成人的後一代。今日我們站在各自的崗位上，用着不同種類的武器，施展不同方式的戰鬥，我們也可以這末說：是為着我們的後一代！　　保育我們的後一代，也就是培養我們未來新中國的肩負者，建設者！在抗戰的過程中，如果忽略了兒童的保育事業，那末，抗戰將會得不到正確的意義了。　　全面抗戰以來，侵略者的砲口除了對準我們的文化敎育機關外，其次就是我們的兒童們了。成千萬的兒宜在侵略者的砲火下化為灰燼了；而未死的，或者替侵略者的傷兵輸血，或者强裝歸去，施以軍事訓練，預備將來遺回祖國殺害他們自己的父母兄弟姊妹，或者在精神上施以麻醉的敎育，訓練成為侵略者馴順的小羔羊。……　　在這樣的情况下，我們的兒童保育事業難道可以忽視它麼？　　上海成為「孤島」以來，曾有過一個時期，街頭巷尾，赭紅色的小棺材，慘黃色的小荷包，差不多是到處皆是，成為了「上海是嬰孩的地獄」。而現在，上海在表面上雖然是蓬勃繁榮，然而，受着這次侵略者砲火之害者，究屬多數。我們的被害的孩子，在這個被人當作「安樂窩」或是「世外桃源」的大上海，他們過着的悲慘的生活，眞是令人不忍去想像呵！　　「上海兒童保育會」的產生，因此，可以說是全上海被害的孩子們的一種幸福！　　「上海兒童保育會」是陳鶴琴先生（該會理事長），陳濟成先生（該會副理事長），和黃定慧女士（該會副理事長），以及其他熱心兒童保育事業的二十幾位先生所支持成立的。他們所以要發起這一個兒童保育會，是因為見到不幸的兒童，如：有被遺棄的，有受「天災兵禍」的，有失業的，有疾病的，有營養不足的，有流浪街頭的，有年幼做工的，在上海眞是到處都有，為使這些顚連無吿的兒童，早些得到敎養之所，因此就有「上海兒童保育會」的組織。　　該會現巳舉辦的事業，有「報童學校」十所，統計敎育了報童有五百人之多。這種事業，深得上海各界人士的贊助。如在社會方面，有學校和收容所供借課室；各大報各雜詰的輿論贊助；目去年十一月份起，該會更得申報館的合作辦理報童學校，每月供給十校所需經費三百元，先行試辦六個月，並捐贈全體報童馬夾及制帽等物。　　該會的報童學校除得到各界人士的贊助外，在報童學校自身的敎學方面，也有許多的改進，如：每週舉行一次校務會議，檢討上週，計劃下週的工作概况；在敎師中挑選富有敎育經騐者，每週到各校視導一次或二次，隨時解决困難問題，增進敎學效率；各校敎師交互參觀上課情形，事後誠懇批評，相互學習，集衆長以為長，力求敎學改進；以及編輯報童適用的敎材等等。　　除了上述的「敎學改進方面」，還有在訓導方面的實施，如各敎師分別到報童家中實行「家庭訪問」，以求學校與家庭打成一片：編印「小愛迪生」信條，隨時指導，養成報童「愛人愛己觀念，「團結合作」思想；「集體生活」習慣；根據報童訓導目標，訂定每週中心訓練項目，按部就班，循序漸進，務使今日為健全之報童，他日為健全之報販，健全之國民；每月規定兩次，在申報館集合，由報館派卡軍接送，實施職業指導，以及訓練報童「做人」「做事」態度，「敬業」「樂業」精神等等。　　在報童自己的活動方面，有：聯合宜誓；競賽（分個人與團體兩方面）擴大招生運動，規定每校招收新生百分之三十，以及此外如：演講比賽，節約救難，和生活儲蓄等等。　　在報童學校敎師的進修方面，有：學術演講，時事硏究，讀書討論，集體創作（各種補充敎材的編輯），敎育參觀，（報童敎育為新創事業，為避免「閉門造車，出門不能合軌」起見，特參觀本市著名學校及成績優良之收容所，以資借鏡），和寒假進修等等。　　「上海兒童保育會」第一期的工作，要算上述的「報童學校」辦得最有成續了。現在該會巳規定第二期工作，計有二項：第一，是組織「童工敎護委員會」，第二，是設立童丐敎養院」。後者該會巳在積極進行了，我們希望全上海熱心「兒童保育」事業的人士，加以經費的捐助，使「童丐敎養院」能在最短期內舉辦成功。這不僅是造福於兒童，這也是造福於我們艱困苦鬥中的國家，然而又何嘗不是造福於我們自己的子孫們呢？　　凡贊助該會「以採取最經濟，最迅速，最能持久之方法，力謀保育兒童，以養成中華民國之健全國民」的宗旨的，都可以加入該會，聞該會會員共分三種：第一種是「名譽會員」，一次繳納會員費五十元以上者；第二種是「贊助會員」，一次繳納會員費二十五元以上者；第三種是「普通會員」，每年繳納會費二元以上者。我們希望贊助「兒童保育」事業的，快快加入該會去。　　最後，筆者對於該會吸收新會員，有一點小小的意見供獻。筆者覺得凡是贊助「兒童保育」事業，都可加入該會，無須有「二人介紹」，因為如果有人非凡贊助「兒童保育」事業，可是因沒有「二人」之介紹，那末不是無形中把他摒棄在「兒童保育」事業之外了麽？希望「上海兒童保育會」諸先生再加以一番的考慮呵！馮玉梅（一）  鄒嘯　　阿英兄鼓勵我，要我寫一篇含有時代意識的平劇，金素琴也以此見託，於是我便揣想素琴堅殺的性格，根據京本通俗小說中的「馮玉梅團圓」寫了這一本平劇。大意是寫一個女子鼓勵她的愛人去打敵人。屠格湼夫的「前夜」，不也是寫過這樣堅毅性格的女性的麽？為了要使這平劇合於時代，我把岳飛水戰楊么改為移前一年的救廬州大戰金兵，也就是把內亂改為外患。所根據的村料，除京本通俗小說外，有岳飛自己的「申省廬州捷狀」和「題伏魔寺壁」，（此詩即作為劇中岳飛的上塲詩）還有宋史，情史以及韓世忠年譜等等。第一塲和第六塲的前半乃貽白兄所增補，敬此誌謝。此劇金素琴本擬在黃金上演，因環境關係作罷。因為此劇是以女子為主角的，而歷史中抗戰女英雄如粱紅玉花木蘭秦良玉等又大多已經有人寫過，所以本劇取材極為艱苦，因此影響到劇作的本身，未能使我自己滿意。不，主要癥結大約在於我不會想像，過於老實地遵守原來的故事情節去編寫。我特地發表出來，誠懇地希望讀者諸君指正。　　第一場　　（小生上引）幽　潛蛟，何日裏奮起雲霽？（白）功名未就暫依劉，莫把英雄當寇警。飛籥走壁稱絕技，虛名浪說賽猿猴。小生范希周，與范汝為同族。范汝為殺敗官兵，佔據建州。為因小生有飛簷走壁之能，百尺城墙，也能用雲梯爬走如飛，故此綽號賽猿猴，被范汝為逼留在此。叉因小生也會弄些文墨，故爾要小生做個書記，尋常不大使喚，倒也清閒自在。小生本想不從，後來一想，一死不難，依舊於國無補，於民無益，故爾忍辱在此，他日將大義慢慢開導於他，勸他歸順宋邦，方了我心頭之願也，（唱搖板）屈身草莽終非計，要將大義覺愚迷。（下）　　第二場　　（四隨從上，二車夫執車旗護旦上，生執馬鞭上唱）離了關西向前走，王命在身敢遲留？登山渡水車馬驟，迢迢千里往福州。（白）下官馮忠翊，關西人氏，蒙國恩除授福州監稅，因此迢迢千里，帶領小女玉梅，一同赴任。素聞七閩之地，憑山負海，乃東南都會，富庶之邦。目今金虜渡河，兩浙都彼他殘破。雖然閩地不遭兵火，也就受其影響，加以天災相逼，各地大早，一路行來，巳至建州地面，但見民不聊生，赤地千里，好不凄凉人也！（唱）一心只把金人恨，興動干戈害生靈。人禍天災相繼起，哀鴻遍地淚不禁！（頭目領四嘍囉暗上）（頭目）那廂有一女子，生得如花似玉，不免搶與大王，做個押寨夫人，也好記功領賞。衆弟兄，搶！（一嘍囉搶旦下，三嘍囉與生及隨從開打，同下，生又上白）哎呀，我見玉梅被强賊搶去了！强賊去遠，追趕不及。不免上任以後，再派捕快仔細在建州附近緝訪便了。玉梅！我兒！兒囉！（拭淚下）巴黎蜜月  白華　　“Paris　Honeymoon”　　派拉蒙公司出品　南京大戲院映　　在「新水滸」中飾率直的海盜的亞金泰米洛夫，和飾小姑娘的茀蘭茜絲卡茄爾，在「巴黎蜜月」中更有了驚人的成績。亞金泰米洛夫在本片中飾演「波士托尼克」市長，在導演者的渲染之下，他是一反了那種粗野，率直的作風，而是一個塗上了滑稽色彩的卡通人物。他那種誇張的動作，帶着法語尾音的快對白，雖然出塲不多，但他的精湛的演技，是給予本片生色不少的。茀蘭茜絲卡茄爾的「玫瑰皇后」則幾乎使「低音歌王」平克勞斯貝為黯然失色。她出塲時的天眞頑皮，遇勞頓後的追逐，知道勞頓將和迪雷米伯爵夫人結婚時的憂鬱，「農房　棲」時的如泣如訴，參加大會時，在花車上的無以自遣，……茀茜蘭絲卡茄爾演來，都非常深刻，動人。「巴黎蜜月」在演出上的收穫，應該歸功於這位匈牙利美人的。　　相反的，平克勞斯貝除了唱出四支歌曲外，依舊不能給人滿意的成續。　　導演者處理這個故事的手法，因為他太放縱橫的滑稽發展，如勞頓的僕人，愛德華霍登的呆緩的動作：警察的扳吃角子老虎；警察，勞頓和迪雷米伯爵夫人，及「波士托尼克」市長的三次飮了藥酒後的狂態；在個別塲面看來，這些滑稽穿插，比之什麼兄弟等的硬滑稽還高明得多，但因之把整個故事割裂了；甚至最後曼雅和「波士托尼克」市長結婚的時候的高潮，導演者依舊處處在注意滑稽穿挿，如勞頓的汽車忽然在中途停止，新郎的發酒瘋，汽車追來搶了新娘疾馳而走來了個非常有趣的歌聲和犬吠聲相混的結束，這不但看的時候覺得有拖泥帶水之感，而且時間與空閒上也不尤許你有如許橫的發展的。　　在主綫上導演者却處理得非常細膩，活潑，如：（一）勞頓起程赴巴黎，汽車駛過鏡頭後，路道化水道，水道化鐵路，鐵道化勞頓的脚的特寫，他已到了巴黎，這手法是很新穎的；（二）介紹八十里的玫瑰村時，他是這樣寫的：遍地的玫瑰花；少男少女在採擷玫瑰；少男把玫瑰投到少女籃中；一輛馬車，車中站着一個孩子，在装置玫瑰；再接到勞頓的汽車，車上人都在深呼吸，嗅玫瑰的香味；（三）介紹曼雅——「玫瑰皇后」出塲：曼雅在河畔洗衣；她的同伴在高坡上投下石塊；濺了曼雅一面泥屑；她用衣服反投過去的時候，投在汽車上的勞頓面上；以後他們二人在城堡中的頑皮演出，都輕快，自然。而對於情感氣氛的把握，也有幾塲精彩的戲；如勞頓和迪雷米伯爵夫人通雷話唱着情歌時，曼雅在旁靜聽着；「農房雙棲」時，他們劃地為牢，曼雅的生火取暖，捉鷄煑鷄，後來兩人相偎着談到明天的大會；及大會那塲曼雅在花車上的折斷花枝，勞頓出來後的狂歡，細膩而週密。大會時鏡頭的活潑，和音樂的配置，也有很大的帮助。　　至於「巴黎蜜月」的故事，那不過是個綜錯的四角戀愛而已。　　人人應佩　樂善章雨過天青  包天笑　　第五回　春到碧蘿香浮雪海　花飛虎阜月滿蠡湖　　何儷玉道：『君素姊！後來怎麼樣呢？你們這幾位令叔怎麼樣了呢？』吳君素道：『多謝這戰神的惠臨，大砲轟醒了這許多醉生夢死的人，却改變過來了。我們家也破了，這幾位叔叔姑姑，不能不出來謀生。後來讀書的讀書，求職業的求職業，再也不能做寫意朋友了。就是我這位托着托盤賞香烟的堂房叔叔，後來學習了無綫電，如今成為一位電學家了。他本來人很聰明，從前也曾研究及此，因為家裏有幾個錢，太舒服了，遂無心及此。却為時勢的迫促，使他自已不得不振作起來。要不然，一輩子就這樣糊裏糊塗，踱踱觀前街就完事了。還吿訴你一個笑話，我有一位姑母，她一向是住在上海的。她生了兩個兒子，就是我的表兄，一個比我大兩歲，一個比我大一歲，都是嬌養慣了的。民國廿六年八一三事變的上半年，我們姑母帶了他們回到蘇州外婆家來，就是我們的家裏。我兩位表兄，一是九歲，一是八歲。但他們到吾家來，覺得種種的不便。第一，他們大便，是坐慣了抽水馬桶的，到吾家來，坐在便桶上，無論如何，不能大便。我們姑母要打要駡，他們只愁眉苦臉，無法可使。我們家裏都是老式房子，那裹去弄個抽水馬桶呢？第二，沒有自來水，也感覺不便。而且他們都是公子哥兒脾氣，呼奴使婢慣了的，動不動就使性子。後來砲聲響了，他們母子三人，逃難逃到了安徽的黃山脚下，一個鄕村裏。到那時還能放出公子哥兒脾氣來嗎？以前吃東西很麻煩，這樣不要吃，那樣不要吃，此刻要吃沒有吃。買菜要走三里多路，買肉要走十里多路，試問吃些什麽呢？以前呼奴使婢，此刻誰肯跟你去逃難。　兄兩人，帮着他母親到山溪裏汲水，兩人合扛着一桶水，還敢說什麽沒有自來水不便嗎？以前沒有抽水馬桶不能大便的，此刻登野坑也慣了。住在黃山脚下，一年有半，回來時，我兩位表兄，面色紅裹泛紫，精神健旺，再沒有從前嬌養的習慣。當時我聽得父親說着一句話，他說道：「不信在逃難的時世中，倒可以鍜鍊兒童咧。」道話我如今還記得。』（五六）</p>

<p>游藝界上海電影觀衆的新傾向  呆子　　——影院經理所發表的談話　　最近大陸報爲探知上海電影觀衆的愛好，厭惡，和一般的態度起見，遍訪各大電影院的經理。所獲得的消息，很可爲讀者介紹一下，因此，筆者根據各影院經理所發表的談話，寫在下面：　　男星最愛埃洛爾弗林　上海的電影觀衆，目前對於好萊塢。他所主演的「羅賓漢」和「鐵血主義」，都是賣座最盛的片子。繼埃洛爾弗林之後上海的電影觀衆表示愛好的是克拉克蓋博，泰羅鮑華，和威廉鮑惠爾等。（昨據華納公司宣稱，埃洛弗林失蹤已兩周，公司方面懸賞五百元找尋中。）　　女星最愛狄安娜寶萍　好萊塢的女星，和埃洛爾弗林一樣，最受上海電影觀衆的歡迎者，是狄安娜寶萍。亞洲影院公司曾印狄安娜寶萍的照片一萬張，可是在三天之內，每張都被人要了去。　　秀蘭鄧波兒賣座不衰　近幾年來，好萊塢這所影城之中，都在預測秀蘭鄧波兒的降落問題。但就上海的電影觀衆說來，對於這位小明星，還是和以前一樣的歡迎。聽說有她所主演的影片上映，一定會滿座。所以有一家影院經理向人表示，秀蘭鄧波兒在上海的賣座，並沒有衰落。瑙瑪希拉，尤其是「絕代艷后」Maria　Antoinette一片公映之後，格外受上海電影觀衆的愛戴。　　白雪公主的賣座最盛　另外好萊塢一般影片公司都用偉大的塲面，攝製壯麗的鉅片，而據一個影院經理說，近來一張影片，映期的長短，就看這一點。凡是塲面偉大，佈景壯麗的影片，映期一定會加長。在過去一年之中，上海的觀衆對於成功的影片，要算「白雪公主」Snow　White　and　the　Seven　Dwarfs，甚至在第二輪影院放映，也每日映五塲，而每塲擠滿觀衆。其次排在「白雪公主」的後面，便是「羅賓漢」。以製片者的獲利說來，後者實際上更超過前者。　　中國影片的新走向　關於中國影片，一位經理指出歷史片的風行，也有其理由，在現在的緊張情狀下，祗有這種典型的影片，才可不受阻礙。比較上目前的影片，不大受檢查，主要的原因，就在製片者所抱的態度，以爲一部影片，如果檢查時遭遇障礙，便賺不到錢；因此，他們不再製作要被檢查掉的影片。大多數被檢查掉的影片，是怕在上海這複雜的城市中，公映之時，有傷若干邦國的情感。　　卓別麟的新片問題　最後，談到卓別麟的新片問題，各影院經理都不能預言這部影片將來是否能在上海公映，但他毋都肯定的表示，卓別麟是爲中國觀衆所歡迎的。卓氏的影片，和勞萊哈台合演的影片，每是可得到很好的賣座。至於勞萊哈台的拆夥問題有一個經理以爲拆夥之後，勞萊應得加入卓別麟的班子，他們同樣是笑匠，應當在一起合作。卓別麟的新片，他是第一次在銀幕上開口，他以前所以避免開口，是爲了在他以爲他的言語，說得太斯文，不配他的手杖。但現在，他在描寫獨裁者的影片，可以操受過敎育者的言語，自然比較適合了。遊擊區公演　抗戰游藝  （金）　　國軍西撤後，滬郊各縣，如上海·南匯·奉賢·川沙·寶山·嘉定·松江等處重要點綫，雖相繼淪陷於日軍鐵蹄之下，然大部政權，仍在我流動部隊控制中。一昨友人自內地來，述及滬郊遊擊隊，除不時以聲東擊西的方法襲擊日軍據點外，更爲增加遊擊區內民衆的抗戰情緒，抗戰精神計，特由政治訓練部著手組織抗戰流動劇團，表演抗日話劇，該團由李君擔任主任，劇員都係遴選愛好藝術的青年志士，其處女劇「和平之賊」，已編製完成，現在積極訓練，即將輪流分赴各鄉鎭公演游藝珍聞　　鑫記大舞台主人范恒德，定今日中午假座悅賓樓招待後台藝員舉行春宴，以資聯歡。　　武生徐雲霆，在台上摔傷足部，請假休養，現延傷科醫生診治，以其足筋受傷頗重，禁止起床行走。　　天蟾舞台武生王桂卿辭班，台主顧竹軒在懇切挽留中，惟王已將四壁所懸綢幛卸去，以表去志已堅，有演至月底，與黃桂秋同時脫離訊。　　大世界聯友話劇社，近由王九公編導趣劇全部王先生，頭本爲王先生大鬧大菜間，顧小呆飾王先生，張醒悟飾小陳，王九公飾王師母，詼諧百出，現續排二本小陳招親，定十二號夜塲公演，又該世界之蓬萊話劇團編排全部八仙得道，日內演出。　　新新公司大京班坤旦董明艷，原應武生，武藝甚衝，日內將反串其傑作周瑜歸天一劇。袁紹梅罷舞歸上海  玉繩　　在港嫁人說係誤傳　擬重回電影圈服務　　袁紹梅以前是明星影片公司的女演員之一，戰後因爲明星公司停業，驟失生活上的憑依，兼因迺父病逝，身後蕭條，一切都依仗著她來維持，於是袁紹梅在這樣環境驅策之下，便以女明星的身分，下海伴舞，後來又與嚴月嫺同往香港，鬻舞於皇后大道的國泰舞廳香港的國泰舞廳，和上海的國泰舞廳，規模相髣髴。袁紹梅在香港，差不多逗留了將近一年，她的摟抱生涯，相當的好，自然電影的頭銜給予她不少幫助，而她的　麗的姿容與精嫺的舞技，也是足以使一般舞客醉心的因素。前些時盛傳她已經在香港爲一富家子藏諸金屋，而罷舞退隱了。其實這是出於誤傳，現在袁紹梅已賣棹歸來，返抵上海，證明她的嫁人之說是不確。據袁紹梅說：她亟於回滬的原因有二，其一是在香港逗留得久了，對於伴舞生涯，已感覺到厭倦，而同伴中如嚴月嫺姊妹（嚴氏姊妹三人，皆在國泰爲舞女）都早已回上海，所以也倦遊思歸了。其二是香港舞國的情況，自廣州失陷後，已大不如前，收入遠沒有初到香島時那麽好，而生活程度則相當的高。有此兩種原因，於是袁紹梅便又回到這「第一孤島」的懷抱中來。袁紹梅表示；如果有機會，她希望能夠重回電影圈，爲新生中的國產電影業努力且看孤島之武生　盡是蓋家之天下  愛美廬主人　　蓋呌天與楊小樓，分執南北武生牛耳，自北方之强物化後，南方之强，惟蓋獨尊，父子四人，分任三大劇壇台術，蓋五可謂老運亨通矣。呌天鑑於以前配角之高下，影響其自身之成績，特商請戚家金牡丹，爲女主角潘金蓮，以收紅花綠葉之效。牡丹爲已故老伶工戚艷冰（即綠牡丹黃玉麟之師）之女，戚厚卿之姪女，家學淵源，聰慧卓絕，戚厚卿領導牡丹姊妹，遠征菲島，金牡丹遍於此時患眼疾而折回，今與呌天同台，英雄美人，相得益彰，因其表演細膩，嬌艷動人，確爲武二生色不少，余於臺上攝其戲叔數照，擇刊一幀，以資介紹蓋呌天與金牡丹之戲裝醇酒廬劇話（下）  屮屮　　章遏雲名滿南北，愚素忽視坤角，（自注孟小冬除外）未加注意。茲見其飾狄雲鸞，口齒清晰，神情活潑，的是閩門旦材料，其始終不懈，尤坤角所難能。愚嘗調男子飾旦，本不合理，因其人才輩出，遂不敢講議，今四大名旦，勝極一時，日中則昃，後起無人，繼之者或爲坤旦乎？昔日之坤角，身在舞台，而一心焉以爲鴻鵠將至，神情不屬，是以不爲顧曲家所稱許。今觀遏雲，絕無此種毛病，精誠專一，則芙蓉出匣，期不遠矣。惟瑤卿之念白，本分兩種：　中年以後所用，純尚剛勁，從口中吐出，如具千斤重量。芙蓉近頗刻意模彷，但祗可用於戲中之中年婦人，如探視之旗婦，探母之太后，得意緣中之二娘，樊江關中之樊梨花，皆甚相稱。若施之樊江關中薛金蓮，或得意緣中雲鸞，即不類矣。　中年以前所用，以輕脆流利爲主，表面似甚柔媚，但其力均含蓄不露，所謂棉裏針也。尚梅荀均學之，而慧生最神似，慧生能以閩門旦戲，橫行國中，蓋得力於此，故演狄雲鸞薛金蓮諸角，宜以慧生爲法。今遏雲念白，頗與芙蓉草相似，豈此戲爲桐珊所授耶？剛勁則剛勁矣，然失去小女子嬌癡蘊藉韻味，似宜略改。又是日惡餞與老旦對面一塲，小生跪處，過於偏左，芙蓉草槍挑元寶，大露馬腳，若雲鸞始終抱住大杖，小生跪處稍近，便近情理。遏雲琴師穆君本有短弓之誚，然其穩亦不可及，旦角南邦子倒板後之下句過門，極美，此過門，祗此處專用，故能者絕少，穆君曾爲艷秋操琴，名下果不虛傳，上海戲迷雖多，除吾友適可主人外，能拉此過門者，恐不多矣。新書介紹　　梅花館主主編之「半月戲劇」第二卷第三期，已前日出版，內容較前益見充實，封面三色版印，美麗絕倫。文字有蘇少卿，儀青齋主，朱瘦竹，張肖傖，施病鳩，諸名家有價值之作品，銅面三十餘幅，中國圖書公司總代售。棋苑  鮑子波編　陸承鑄校　　開局法　第十九局　　黑先　　反宮馬對當頭炮　　着法　　炮二平五　馬二進三　馬二進三　炮八平六　車一平二　士四進五　炮八平七　馬八進七　兵三進一　卒九進一　馬八進九　相三進五　車九平八　炮二平一　車二進六　車九進三　解釋　　兵三進一先進兵、不使對方挺卒、爲執當頭炮者又一著法、其目標在取敵方七路之卒、卒九進一爲伏兵之計、馬八進九起馬、車九平八先手出車、炮二平一攻取邊勢、然後利用自己邊卒、制止敵方邊馬、車二進六意欲去卒壓馬、車九進三已在卒九進一時預料中、强逼對車一著、可免壓馬之厄、所謂運用得當、掩護有力、按反宮馬之應法、頗不易易、其最難用者、七路之馬、稍一不愼、輒自傾軋、甚至全盤顚沛、終於敗績、故開局之時、極須注意、　　禮讓往還著法　　車一平五下車五退一　炮一進一　馬八退九　車一平五　車五退二　炮一進九　象九退七　卒二平三　炮八退九　卒三平二　車七退八　卒二平三故都宮闈梨園秘史（一二五）  徐慕雲　　孫老元拉胡琴時能吸鼻煙　　第二次是叔岩唱「寄子」因爲沒帶好旦角，遂把梆子班出身的王靈珠飾鄧伯道的弟婦，等到生旦合唱「走青山望白雲家鄉何在」這段三眼二黃時，王靈珠雖是未如增長勝那樣忘了戲詞，然而卻將青衣慢板的腔兒全行忘掉，本來他就不會唱皮黃的慢板，那天爲了同余老板配「寄子」不得不現鑚鍋，大凡對於某一齣戲沒有根的，心裏必定發慌，越發慌越會出漏子，等到他一張嘴，先就有點涼絃。（涼絃就是所發出聲音的高低與胡琴截然不同）登時就把孫老元嚇的一楞，及至留心他唱的腔調，既非梆子腔，又非二黃調，這時雖有胡琴聖手當前，可也抓啦瞎啦。孫杭兩人實在沒有辦法啦，只好把弓子和鼓板暫時休息三秒鐘，他們掩琴（非旗）息鼓不要緊，可是王老板的法曲妙音，竟赤裸裸的晾在聽客的耳朶裏，那種黃腔走板不搭調的味兒，眞有萬分說不出來的難聽呀。同時杭子和的瓜皮小帽殼，歪斜關罩到眉毛上，顯出要打磕衝的神情，孫老元兩隻猴眼直釘著他瞧，這時直把個海上名旦王靈珠沒給活活的羞死急死。後來再接唱「山又高水又深無計可奈」一段的下句時，那簡直要難爲的哭了出來。從前塲面上的能手動不動就使壞主意，拿著本領不到家的角兒耍著玩，這也是內行的一種惡習慣呢。　　王靈珠彼時以隨信芳（麒麟童）配戲，復經鄭孝胥等揄揚，在海上旦行裏也算數一數二的紅角兒，他受到孫杭二人的耍弄，按理說他是必不甘心的，然而後來也竟沒聽說有甚麽反響，這難道說老元的能耐，眞有甚麽驚人之長麽。這話說起來，實在不屈心，人家可眞有幾手絕活，恐怕古今的琴師裏都辦不到的。</p>

<h3>Fierce Counter-Offensive by Elite Chinese Troops Between Jingzhong and Hanyi; Taipingchang, Lujiazhai, and Other Places Reclaimed One After Another; Japanese Casualties Reaching 7,000-8,000 After Over Ten Days of Fierce Fighting; Guangdong Authorities' Efforts to Defend the West River Make Defenses More Solid; Chinese Troops on Hainan Island Still Holding Key Passes and Engaging in Fierce Battles with the Japanese</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing Dispatch: Chinese troops dispatched strong forces to launch a fierce counter-offensive between the Jingzhong and Hanyi roads. Approximately one thousand Japanese troops are currently in Zhongxiang, belonging to the 13th Regiment of the 6th Division. On the 9th, they shelled the east bank of the Xiang River throughout the day. Chinese artillery also returned fire, and the Japanese troops did not dare to cross the river. A certain army of the advancing Chinese forces reached near Wamiao and Yihe, and the Japanese troops also reinforced their positions, leading to fierce and bloody battles. Fierce fighting also occurred in Yangzizhen, Changshoudian, north of Zhongxiang. Japanese troops on the Zhe River continuously shelled Suizhou, but there were no signs of a major offensive. (Special dispatch at 12:00 PM on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yichang Dispatch: After the Chinese army in Hubei actively launched a counter-offensive, the war situation stabilized. A certain Chinese unit launched an attack from a certain location on the morning of the day before yesterday, captured Ban Yan Town at noon, and recaptured Taipingchang and Lujiazhai before dusk. After nightfall, they also recovered Yinpingchang. All battles were victorious, with numerous enemy kills and captures. They are currently advancing rapidly towards a certain location. (Dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Military News: The authorities consider defending the West River as the first step in defending the southwestern provinces. In addition to deploying heavy troops on the south bank and along the southern route, they have also transferred elite soldiers from a certain division to the West River to cooperate with various divisions of a certain army returning from the Nanxun Line for defense. The West River front line, which has been stalemated for two weeks, has become more solid in its defenses, capable of both defense and offense. Deng Longguang has arrived at the front line to arrange counter-offensives. Chinese troops on Hainan Island are still defending between Dongshan and Jinjiang, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army. There are still thirty to forty Japanese warships off the Leizhou Peninsula. (Special dispatch on the 9th)</p>

Over 500 Japanese soldiers have fallen into the river and drowned. The Japanese troops advancing north from Zhongxiang are currently being contained by Chinese troops south of the Fengle River. Chinese troops are currently holding the positions on the southwestern slopes of the Dahong Mountains, 20 kilometers south of the Fengle River, strongly resisting the Japanese army's attacks. Because the highway north of Zhongxiang is muddy and unusable, preventing the use of mechanized units, the Japanese army has been heavily shelling Chinese positions since yesterday and dispatching large numbers of aircraft to bomb Chinese positions repeatedly. The fighting on the northern front near Suixian is still fierce. Suixian was once in danger, but ultimately relied on the Chinese army's vigorous counter-attack to repel the invading Japanese troops, turning the situation from danger to safety.

The Yellow River is very narrow at that location. The peach flood season has arrived, and the water flow is rapid, making it difficult to transport heavy weapons. The Chinese army on the west bank of the Yellow River also occupies a geographical advantage, making it unlikely that they will cross the river to attack the west.

Merchants are allowed to freely choose which of the above three methods to use. (Dispatch on the 9th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>China's Victory and the Interests of Other Countries in China</h3>
<p>"If China wins the war of resistance, its national power will flourish and its talents will emerge. Will the interests of other countries in China then be squeezed out by the Chinese government and people?"</p>
<p>I wonder if there are any friendly countries that harbor such unfounded fears? According to a report in a Japanese newspaper in Tokyo, Sir Victor Sassoon, a British magnate in Shanghai, while traveling abroad, passed through Japan on his way back to Shanghai and told a Japanese reporter that if China wins the war of resistance, British interests in China would be threatened. I suspect that this person did not make such a statement. When Mr. Sassoon arrived in Shanghai the night before last, I took the opportunity to ask him about it, and he denied it. Looking back at the Sino-Japanese war, foreign businessmen in China have been bullied by the Japanese and suffered many losses, which has caused great resentment. At the same time, they are worried about their fate after China's victory. Mr. Sassoon denied the rumor, but there are many people who share this concern. It is not only foreign businessmen in China who are worried, but also the Japanese side, who have long used this as a means to sow discord and incite international opinion against supporting China. Therefore, some second- or third-rate politicians and journalists in various countries have been misled and bewildered, saying that there is cause for concern if China wins the war. Some commentators even believe that, apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan, there are other countries that do not want to restrain Japan; not out of any love for Japan, but because they fear that China will rise and they will suffer. The hesitation and vacillation of the international community towards the Far East, which has created a gloomy situation, is also due to the aforementioned concerns.</p>
<p>However, observing the recent attitude of the international community towards China, it has already changed its lip service policy of previous years and is actually taking the opportunity to provide assistance to China. Russia's continuous supply of military supplies goes without saying. The League of Nations and its member states have been sending support to China in terms of technical, medical, and relief aid, one after another. This clearly shows their deep sympathy for China, and it is not a matter of mixed interests. Furthermore, the efforts of Myanmar and Vietnam to vigorously develop their transportation routes to China, and the repeated loans of large sums of money to China by Britain and the United States, are by no means simply a matter of perfunctory gestures or mere comfort. These actions have indeed greatly benefited China's war of resistance. In the face of this situation, while China must be grateful to friendly countries, it is of course not complacent. On the part of Britain and the United States, while they have already taken some action, it cannot be said that they have exhausted their efforts. What is comforting is that the policies of various countries towards the Far East have not been adversely affected by the aforementioned concerns. This is evidenced by the current international situation.</p>
<p>Worries such as those and circumstances such as these, there are no cause-and-effect relationships between them, it is true. However, in order to prevent the sowing of discord, to promote the determination and resolve of the governments and people of various countries, to enhance mutual trust between China and various countries, and to stabilize the moral foundation between China and various countries, it is necessary to dispel such concerns. How to dispel them? If one seeks to understand the origin of these worries, one must know that they are of unclear origin and dismiss them with a smile. If one analyzes the factors that constitute these worries, one will also know that they are based on misperceptions, misunderstandings, and weak and immature notions that are not worth refuting. In my opinion, the most important thing to understand and believe is three points: China is a vast land with abundant resources. Except for a few cities that have been touched by modern trends and have a certain modern scale, other vast areas resemble Europe in the 19th century or even less. The need for development and construction, even if we are just talking about it, is difficult to exhaust, let alone the fact that there is absolutely no shortcut. Therefore, even if China exhausts its national strength after winning the war against Japan, and makes every effort to catch up, it will probably take half a century to achieve even a rough scale. To say that China would abandon this grand vision and merely envy the meager achievements and limited interests of various countries in China, and resort to plunder and squeeze them out, is simply unreasonable and impossible. Even in the so-called few cities, after the devastation of the war, they are full of scars. Even to restore them to their former state will take ten or twenty years. If one wants to emulate modern European and American cities, the difference is even greater. This is the most urgent task for the Chinese government and people after the war, and they do not want to create unnecessary complications by seeking to infringe on the interests of other countries in China. This is the first point. Furthermore, whether it is to rebuild cities or develop rural areas, in terms of China's current human and material resources, success will be difficult. It cannot be denied that the nation's active capital is limited. If one only considers space and not time, that would be one thing; otherwise, to seek simplicity and efficiency, it is essential to obtain assistance from friendly countries, both in terms of capital and especially technology. Therefore, to say that China could both squeeze out the existing interests of various countries and absorb foreign human and material resources is simply not permitted by reason and therefore not adopted by China. This is the second point. From the beginning of the war of resistance until now, more than twenty months have passed. During this time, there have been times when the attitudes of various countries have disappointed China, and even angered China. The past is over, and I will not elaborate on it here. If we were to follow the path of anger, the Chinese people would use the spirit of resisting Japan to resist everything. In that case, this article would be a false and hypocritical statement, and would have no credibility with the governments and people of various countries. But now, we are not doing that. Various countries have changed their lip service policies and are seeking to provide practical assistance to China. China is also grateful for the benefits received and is understanding of various countries. From now on, a foundation of morality will be established between China and various countries. Given the Chinese national character and the old beliefs of China, to say that China will repay kindness with resentment and seek to harm the interests of various countries in China is also impossible and unreasonable. This is the third point. Just as there are voices in the British Parliament that loudly proclaim that China's war of resistance is being fought to protect British interests in China. Such words are close to the truth. Although China does not derive greater or more concrete comfort from such words, it is nevertheless pleased to know that there are those in Britain who are aware of this. The Chinese air force once flew over Japan, but did not drop bombs, only scattering leaflets and returning. This can represent China's moral values.</p>
<p>Only these things can dispel the worries that various countries have about China after the victory of the war of resistance. This is what I hope for.</p>
<h3>British Financial Aid to China; Finance Minister Kong Expresses Delight; Stabilizing Legal Tender Made Easier; Belief in Victory Against Japan Strengthened</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Finance Minister and Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi, when meeting with guests today, expressed great delight at the success of the stabilization fund negotiations. He stated that this loan would make it easier to continue maintaining the stability of legal tender. This action further proves the British concern for China's financial and economic situation and is an act of visionary politicians, which can obviously benefit both countries. The Chinese government and people are deeply grateful. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Song Zi Liang met with Reuters reporters today, discussing the announcement of a loan of 10 million pounds to China for the stabilization fund. He expressed optimism about the future financial position of the Chinese government. He stated that the Chinese legal tender has maintained stability since June of last year, and now the joint stabilization fund established by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications on the Chinese side, and HSBC and The Chartered Bank on the British side, has gained an even stronger foundation. China has a surplus in international payments, which prevents foreign exchange reserves from continuing to flow out. Therefore, the establishment of a joint stabilization fund by major Chinese and British banks, whose amount is many times greater than the resources ever used by the Bank of China, is welcomed by all those involved in China's domestic and foreign trade and is considered a factor in the stability of Chinese currency. After Song recounted the currency steps taken by China last year, he further stated that experience has shown that our expectations were completely correct. Although the successive falls of Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Hankou triggered speculative actions, the foreign exchange market was still firmly maintained. The Bank of China was even able to repurchase all of the foreign exchange used to aid the legal tender in the event of any serious military setbacks when the exchange market was quiet. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) All sectors of the Chinese community here welcome the announcement of the 10 million pound stabilization fund. All evening newspapers have given it prominent coverage, and the government's wireless radio has broadcast this news everywhere. All sectors of the Chinese community believe that this loan not only has important financial and economic implications but also even greater political implications. The belief in China's ultimate victory in the war of resistance has been strengthened by this loan. However, the government has not issued any comments other than verifying this news. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>France to Follow in the Footsteps of Britain and the United States in Providing Economic Aid to China; Democratic Nations Take Joint Action; Shattering Japan's Dream of Destroying Chinese Currency</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to observations from the U.S. Congress, this joint economic action by democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France in relation to China is entirely a response to the Japanese implementation of exchange controls and import-export controls in North China this week. According to news from here today, in addition to the British loan of 10 million pounds, France is also preparing to take similar action. At the same time, these actions all lead to the same goal as the previous U.S. loan to China through different routes. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news revealed today, the French government will jointly provide economic assistance to China with Britain and the United States, guaranteeing China's payments for purchases of goods from France and guaranteeing loans from French manufacturers to China. According to well-informed sources, although France has not announced its policy on loans to China, the French government's economic assistance to China with trusted guarantees is already a substantial form of aid. French authorities are currently discussing with the British side the fundraising for the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, giving China a "lifeline" to reach the sea. However, there is currently no accurate information on the exact amount of funds needed to build this railway or the total amount of commercial loans. According to reports from the Chinese community here, the largest transaction between China and foreigners is about to be completed here. It is said that this transaction includes the purchase of a large number of trucks. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to official declarations here today, the British loan of a large sum to China is sufficient to help the Chinese side stabilize its currency system and can resist Japan's attempts to devalue Chinese currency in North China and Shanghai. The government believes that although the Japanese side is attempting to undermine the Chinese currency system, the loan obtained by the Chinese side this time is sufficient to stabilize the value of the Chinese yuan indefinitely. Moreover, the British loan this time, in addition to being sufficient to stabilize the Chinese currency system, is also sufficient to promote China's international trade. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Since the announcement of the British loan of 10 million pounds to China, the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender against the U.S. dollar has increased by fifteen pence, reaching US$16.15. The Chinese community here believes that after the success of the British loan, all democratic countries related to the Far East will soon have similar economic assistance to China. British figures believe that this action by the British government is a sign of Britain's increasingly tough stance towards the Far East. Although Britain's assistance to China this time is only in supporting China's legal tender, its effect is to thwart the Japanese conspiracy to undermine the credibility of Chinese legal tender. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Guo Delivers Remarks; Sincere Cooperation Between China and Britain; Both Countries Benefit</h3>
<p>(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon announced to the House of Commons that the Chinese government had established a currency stabilization fund, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi immediately issued a statement to the press, saying that this move is sufficient to show China's strength, whether in finance, commerce, or territorial administration, it can cope with ease. Britain's cooperation with China further proves that the Western countries are providing China with full and proper assistance, which is the best way to maintain their business and British interests in the Far East. This level has become more and more understood. The British action directly helps China, and at the same time, it is sufficient to prove that the common interests of China and Britain must be maintained. This level will be warmly welcomed by our country, I firmly believe. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>The Main Goal of British Aid to China is to Protect Commercial Interests</h3>
<p>(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon announced to the House of Commons that two British banks would assist the Chinese government in establishing a currency stabilization fund, responsible figures here recently stated that this fund will be established in London and will be operated in the same way as the British Exchange Equalisation Account. The main goal of Britain's support for Chinese legal tender is to protect British business in China and is not limited to protecting financial interests. There is absolutely no unfriendliness towards Japan. If the Japanese government raises objections, it should be answered with this intention. In the past, the Japanese government repeatedly stated that it must maintain Chinese currency in a manner that it deems appropriate. The British government is also eager to maintain Chinese currency in a manner that it deems appropriate to prevent British business from being harmed by currency price fluctuations. In short, Britain's move is within the scope of pursuing a friendly and neutral policy towards China and is not discriminating against Japan. In the future, it may assist China in other ways. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Britain Has Notified All Relevant Countries of This Plan</h3>
<p>(London) All newspapers here have published the announcement of the aid to the Chinese legal tender fund in large print and expressed extreme pleasure and satisfaction, with absolutely no dissenting opinions. Figures in the press and financial circles have all pointed out that the result of the establishment of this fund may prevent Japan from realizing its plan to prohibit Chinese legal tender in North China. It is heard that Chinese troops in North China are paid with funds sent from Chongqing, and although the journey is long and there are difficulties, they can still arrive on time. Therefore, this stabilization fund can even provide assistance to Chinese legal tender in North China through the "back door." Reuters, according to reliable responsible sources, said that the small Chinese exchange stabilization fund used in the past nine months has indeed shown profits in transactions. Therefore, the newly established stabilization fund does not necessarily have to be regarded as necessary to support a falling currency. Before announcing this plan in Congress, the US authorities notified all major foreign governments of the British intentions. It is heard that the British note to Japan on this matter mentioned Japan's previous declaration that stabilizing Chinese legal tender is beneficial to Japan. According to the Financial Times, London business figures are paying attention to the cooperation of all countries with trade and interests in China to prevent the continued threat of turmoil in the Chinese market. American and French merchants are currently maintaining close contact. The newspaper continued that a representative of the Paris Chamber of Commerce attended a meeting of the China Group of the London Chamber of Commerce on Sunday to discuss ways to mutually protect trade and interests in China, which can be used as evidence of the aforementioned cooperation. The concept of providing financial assistance to the Chinese government to prevent Japanese forces from penetrating deeply into China has been universally welcomed. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Britain Cannot Turn a Blind Eye to Japan's Attempts in North China</h3>
<p>(London) The Times reported that after the announcement of the establishment of the 10 million pound Chinese exchange stabilization fund, Londoners, especially those concerned with trade in China, were very welcome. The Chinese government has received a great deal of assistance from the US Treasury's large purchases of silver. Although the fund can temporarily support the exchange rate, it is widely believed that the export of this silver has gradually decreased recently, and silver reserves have not been as abundant as expected. Under this kind of environment, this stabilization fund is not an urgent necessity, but it can definitely be a very welcome guarantee. What is particularly satisfying is that the Chinese banking community can provide such a large amount for the use of the stabilization fund. This fund is quite large compared to any future demands. The committee that will manage this fund in Shanghai should exercise its power to maintain the stability of the exchange rate or control its exchange rate. The newspaper continued that because there is a possibility of the collapse of the normal institutions of foreign trade in North China, we must pay great attention to Japan's attempts to force the circulation of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes in North China. However, if it is said that the defense of Chinese legal tender will therefore encounter serious problems, then there is no reason. The establishment and operation of this Chinese stabilization fund has absolutely nothing to do with the many financial measures that the Japanese are attempting, and there are also no political purposes. Sino-British commerce has been greatly reduced due to various difficulties. The British government certainly cannot turn a blind eye to serious difficulties in exchange rates and make Sino-British commerce even more affected. From a purely commercial standpoint, helping Chinese legal tender is a policy of a suggestive nature. As for the method of the exchange loan, there is certainly no problem related to China's debt repayment. However, this matter can make the position of the Chinese government more relaxed. What can be hoped for now is that the Chinese authorities, in this changed environment, can at least have a better performance and not make a declaration that they are unable to loan customs duties to repay foreign debts.

<h3>Resistance to Cruel Aggression Arises from Moral Concepts</h3>
<p>(London) The "Financial News" editorial today stated that from various points of view, the British government's decision to guarantee the Chinese national currency exchange stabilization fund is welcome. This is indeed pleasing news for British merchants in the Far East and Britons holding Chinese government bonds. The Japanese side cannot have legitimate reasons to criticize this. We must help China to resist arrogant and cruel aggression not only because of our own interests but also because of public morality. The one who gave any real help before was the United States, and the actual contribution of the United Kingdom was limited to purchasing several hundred thousand pounds worth of trucks. It was not until yesterday that there was a constructive step. Since the government feels that this move is appropriate, it should not be interrupted until Britain has exhausted its ability to help China. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Strengthening China's War of Resistance is Not Limited to One Way</h3>
<p>(London) The "News Chronicle" stated that for the sake of British financial and commercial interests, the stability of the Chinese currency system is absolutely necessary. This is a good reason to help China, but it is not the best reason. For the sake of greater interests, Japan should not be allowed to arbitrarily inflict its brutal attacks on neighboring countries. There is more than one way that Britain can strengthen China's heroic war of resistance, and financial assistance is one of them. It also said that financial assistance should not be limited to this.

<h3>US Truck Experts Come to the Far East; Will Inspect the New China-Burma Road</h3>
<p>(London) The "Daily Telegraph" reported that Hoger, a truck expert from General Motors in New York, recently left London for the Far East with a mission that may affect the future of the Sino-Japanese War. He will inspect the new China-Burma Road to determine which trucks are most suitable for this road and the climate there. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Chinese Government Places a Large Order for Cotton Cloth with Britain; Details of Negotiations Temporarily Not Announced</h3>
<p>(London) In the House of Commons today, a member asked the Secretary for Overseas Trade, Mr. Hudson, what steps he is taking to ensure the success of the Chinese government's negotiations with Lancashire merchants to place a large order for cotton cloth. Hudson did not give a specific answer to this question, only saying that he was pleased to know that there had been recent inquiries about placing orders for cotton cloth, but announcing the details would be contrary to the customs of the Department of Overseas Trade.

<h3>Spokesperson for the Military Council Issues a Report on the Week's War Situation (Continued)</h3>
<p>(3) Jiangsu-Shandong Front: Japanese troops in the Linyi, Feixian, and Yizhou areas of southern Shandong, as well as the Zaozhuang area, have begun to stir since last week, fiercely attacking Chinese forces in various parts of northern Jiangsu. Since this week, Japanese troops have invaded in three routes. The central route is advancing from Yaowan towards Shuyang, the right wing is advancing along the Taierzhuang-Suqian highway towards Suqian, and the left wing is advancing along the Linyi-Hai'an highway towards Ganyu. At the same time, they are also landing from the areas of Antongwei in southern Shandong and the Kou of the Guanhe River east of Guanyun, aiming to converge and attack, in an attempt to seize the two Chinese strongholds of Huaiyin and Donghai in northern Jiangsu. Since the 4th, when they occupied Suqian, and the 5th, when they occupied Shuyang, they have repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with Chinese troops in various places such as Yanghe, Siyang, Ganyu, Huaiyin, and Donghai. Chinese troops, relying on strong fortifications, are bravely resisting, and Japanese casualties have been very heavy, with estimated losses of one-third. Currently, powerful units of the Chinese army have been rushed to the front lines to reinforce, and their morale is even stronger. They are launching a multi-pronged counterattack.</p>
<p>(4) Shanxi Front: The war situation is quiet. The Japanese troops in southern Shanxi's Yuci, Yongji, and Fenglingdu have no movements at present. However, the Japanese troops in Fenglingdu occasionally shell the opposite bank, which is a bluffing tactic. A unit of several hundred Japanese troops in Lingshi has been constantly invading eastward for several days. More than 200 of them were killed by Chinese troops in the Zhaojiapu area. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in defeat to Jingsheng to hold on. They are currently being surrounded and attacked, and it will not be difficult to capture them. More than 1,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops in Yicheng have been attacking Huayanli village rapidly in recent days. After being ambushed and severely attacked by Chinese troops from the left and right, the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and have collapsed in defeat. They are currently being pursued by troops. More than 1,000 Japanese troops and five or six artillery pieces in Anyi invaded Guyang village via Xinzhuang on the 1st and 2nd. They were intercepted by Chinese troops and fled in disorder. At present, the Japanese troops are still ambitious and have an attempt to invade Qinshui. On the 1st and 3rd, Chinese troops in western Shanxi successively captured the two important strongholds of Gucheng and Heilongguan, killing more than 500 Japanese troops. When the Japanese troops retreated, they set fire to the villages and towns and raped and killed many women. At this moment, Chinese men and women have unanimously joined the guerrilla forces and are obeying orders to kill the enemy. There are fierce battles to the south of Ningwu and to the north of Jingle in northern Shanxi. The Japanese troops have suffered heavy casualties under the overwhelming firepower of the Chinese troops. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>(5) Other Fronts: More than 1,500 Japanese troops in Xianxian, Hebei, invaded in two routes at the beginning of this week. Chinese troops attacked them head-on, killing more than 300 Japanese troops. The Japanese troops collapsed in defeat. More than 2,000 Japanese troops in Xiuwu, northern Henan, have launched fierce attacks on Chinese positions twice this week. After being intercepted by Chinese troops, the Japanese troops suffered more than 200 casualties, abandoned more than 100 bodies, and fled north of Xiuwu. Chinese troops took advantage of the victory to pursue and have already approached Xiuwu. The Japanese troops in Beigang, southern Hubei, were pursued by a certain Chinese unit the day before yesterday. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops were defeated and fled towards Tongcheng. The Chinese side then recaptured Beigang. In addition, several hundred troops of the puppet army led by Li Chengpeng stationed in Ezhou and more than 1,000 troops of the puppet army led by Liu Meixi stationed in Xiaogan have successively killed several Japanese advisors this week, carrying the equipment and supplies of their units, and surrendering to the Chinese side. After being reorganized by the Chinese side, this move has dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese army. After all, with the arrogance of the invaders, it can be clearly seen from this end that they are increasingly approaching the end of their rope. (7th telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police in Beiping Arrest Workers on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from the police, several Chinese railway workers had a dispute over money. Someone informed the Japanese military police, accusing them of being Communists, resulting in several people being arrested. According to Chinese newspapers, about 100 Chinese Communists were arrested. A railway worker under the command of Li Dade (transliteration), a foreman of the Ping-Sui Railway, was dissatisfied with Li due to a money matter. Two months ago, he informed the Japanese military police, accusing Li of being the leader of the first squadron of a Communist special regiment. Li was arrested by the Japanese military police. A roster was then found in Li's residence, listing the names of those working under him. They were also arrested by the Japanese military police and accused of being Communists. Chinese newspapers also reported that these people had been active in the Beiping area, harassing the Japanese army's rear and sabotaging transportation. However, the newspapers did not mention that they were railway workers. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Regimes in the North and South Negotiate Only on Rice and Coal</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese newspapers, the negotiations between the "Provisional" and "Reformed" governments to exchange coal produced in North China for rice produced in Central China have made great progress and are expected to reach a compromise. The Coal and Grain Adjustment Committee of the "Ministry of Industry" here has formulated various measures to reduce food and coal prices. For fundamental remedies, the committee has requested the authorities to implement the exchange of rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang for coal from North China. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police in Tianjin Killed for Opposing the War</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The anti-war sentiment among the Japanese military police in Tianjin is also very strong. Last month, six military police publicly expressed their opposition to the Japanese invasion of China and refuted the Japanese government's cruel remarks. The Japanese authorities heard the news and immediately arrested them. They were executed by firing squad in Tianjin on the 1st of this month. (9th telegram)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Protection of Forests</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that with the rapid development of construction in the southwest, the need for timber is increasing day by day. However, there has been a lack of attention to forest logging in the country. The forest management plan submitted by Wang Jiaji, Director of the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the National Academy of Sciences of China, which proposes the supply of timber from various regions and the protection and renewal of forests, definitely has the need to engage in investigation and research. Therefore, he instructed the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Central Research Institute to discuss the promotion of benefits.

<h3>Robbery is Rampant in Guangzhou City</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: Shops and hotels here are gradually opening, and although single men are required to register, robbery is still rampant in the city. Even foreign shops located in back streets have been robbed. The robbers are mostly armed and fight with Japanese patrols almost every day. The newly organized Chinese police lack personnel, and only carry wooden sticks when on duty, so they cannot resist the robbers. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Coping with Future Emergencies: Britain Strengthens Army Strength; Current Strength: 19 Divisions, 530,000 Men; Training Reserves, Equipping New Weapons; War Minister Reaffirms UK-France Alliance</h3>
<p>(London) War Minister Hore-Belisha recently presented the 1939-40 Army budget to the House of Commons, totaling £161,133,000, and delivered a speech explaining the state of the British Army, emphasizing the need for the Army to be deployed to the European continent for combat if necessary. He stated, "The government has decided to intensify the training of reserve forces and equip them with new weapons to be prepared for any future war on the European continent." At that time, the British reserve forces and regular army would immediately merge, but the entire army could not arrive at the battleground simultaneously and would be dispatched to the European continent in batches. Regarding the strength of the British Army, it currently consists of: (1) Six regular divisions, divided into four infantry divisions and two armored divisions; (2) Twelve reserve divisions, divided into nine infantry divisions, two motorized units, and one armored division; (3) Two independent cavalry brigades, along with several independent units below the brigade level, totaling more than nineteen divisions.</p>
<p>In terms of personnel, excluding the garrisons in India and Burma, there are a total of 531,353 officers and soldiers of all ranks, an increase of approximately 83,000 compared to a year ago. Within this fiscal year, an additional 40,000 new recruits will be enlisted into the regular army. As for air defense units, they have been increased from two to five units, and will continue to increase to seven units. The number of anti-aircraft guns in each unit will be increased by 50% to 100% in the next fiscal year, requiring a total expenditure of approximately £30,000.</p>
<p>In addition, to prevent the reduction of the Army's strength, the government has decided to reinforce the personnel of garrisons in overseas territories, so that when war begins, the garrisons in these territories can fully defend themselves effectively. For example, garrisons in Malta, Cyprus, Ceylon, and Singapore will all add local troops. Even in Hong Kong, 1,000 Chinese and Indian soldiers will be recruited. Furthermore, the government has devoted itself to the mechanization of the Army in the past year. Half of the personnel of four regular infantry divisions can now be moved simultaneously with existing transportation. The mechanization equipment of the reserve forces has also been renovated and equipped with new weapons. "The late War Minister Lord Haldane (died in 1928, served as War Minister in 1905) once wanted to form six regular infantry divisions and one cavalry division. Today, our country has an army of nineteen strong divisions. When Lord Haldane was in office, the reserve forces lacked sufficient equipment to cope with war on the European continent. Today's reserve forces are equipped with new weapons. Compared to the past, there has been great progress."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Chamberlain has repeatedly emphasized the joint relationship between Britain and France on December 14th of last year and February 11th of this year. The British Army is now preparing everything to cope with certain emergencies if necessary. Although the UK has not accepted any constraints after talks between the British and French staff, in spirit, it is wise to be prepared." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) When British War Minister Hore-Belisha presented the Army budget in the House of Commons today, he addressed the question of to what extent Britain should prepare to send troops to Europe in the event of war and gave a partial answer, saying that this issue required careful study and could only be discussed within the scope of national strategic issues. Prime Minister Chamberlain made a declaration on December 14th of last year, clearly announcing the position that Britain would take in certain situations, leaving no doubt. On February 11th of last year, the Prime Minister reiterated his previous remarks, and stated that he had to explain that the interests of Britain and France were shared, and that any threat to the vital interests of France would immediately trigger British cooperation with France. This statement by the Prime Minister was of greater significance than previous statements. Therefore, Britain must consider the use of the British Army and make preparations in certain situations. Although talks between Britain and France did not bind Britain on this point, those who are deeply thoughtful should take precautions. If Britain joins the war, its contribution and the method of making this contribution must be done with all its strength and not be based on any ideal of limited liability. Britain has made very detailed plans, and Britain has calculated the needs of shipping, as the historical limitations of British troops operating abroad still exist. Every soldier, every artillery shell used, and every vehicle driven must be transported by sea, which means that the entire British army cannot meet the European army on the battlefield at the same time. The talks between Britain and France only involved defensive plans and not aggressive plans. Britain's greatest obligation is now focused on developing a situation that can ensure complete immunity from aggression to the best of its ability. Britain is now determined to achieve this goal.

<h3>British War Minister's Remarks Unanimously Approved by Parliament; The Army Will Be Sent to Europe to Help in Combat If Necessary; The Government's Clear Statement Marks a Beginning</h3>
<p>(London) The speech delivered by War Minister Hore-Belisha to the House of Commons, especially the section on training reserve forces to cope with war on the European continent, has caused a major impression. Britain's preparation to assist France on a large scale in times of war can be clearly seen from this. Members of the House of Commons who spoke after War Minister Hore-Belisha all expressed their approval. Even opposition Liberal MP Southby and former Naval Minister Duff Cooper, who are known for opposing the War Minister's current policies, also nodded in agreement. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) War Minister Hore-Belisha's speech has been commented on by political figures, who say that War Minister Hore-Belisha's statement that Britain must send troops to the European continent for combat if necessary marks the beginning of the government's public expression of this intention. The statement that the British reserve forces and regular army should immediately merge into one in times of war further demonstrates that Britain has a concrete plan for how it will support France in the future. According to the observations of military experts, the troops that Britain should send to France when necessary are divided into two parts: (1) Three motorized divisions that will depart immediately after the start of the war; (2) Several divisions of reserve forces that will begin training immediately after the start of the war and then depart successively. The reason why War Minister Hore-Belisha issued this statement is that the British arms industry has achieved great results since stepping up production, and the weapons produced are all the latest models. Therefore, this clear statement is made to show that Britain is prepared to cope with war and maintain peace with equal determination. This has been unanimously approved by both the government and the opposition parties domestically, and the repercussions it may cause in France, Germany, and Italy will also be significant. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Paris Welcomes</h3>
<p>(Paris) An official spokesman stated today that France warmly welcomes British War Minister Hore-Belisha's remarks that Britain will send an expeditionary force in the event of a European war, which greatly reduces the worry that France will have to bear the brunt alone for several months after the outbreak of a European war while Britain trains its troops, and can quell calls within France for Britain to adopt a compulsory conscription system. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Pay Attention</h3>
<p>(Berlin) People here are paying great attention to British War Minister Hore-Belisha's remarks on the issue of British military intervention in Europe. A political spokesman told a Reuters reporter that what Germany is concerned about is not the number of British troops, but when, where, and under what circumstances they will be deployed. People here regard the British divisions as very formidable troops because they have gained military experience in the colonies. Political circles here are gradually seeing Hore-Belisha as a figure like Roosevelt. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) An Italian military expert commented on British War Minister Hore-Belisha's remarks, saying that Italy did not have any special feelings about Britain's war plans, but that discussing this fact was useless. He also said that the German-Italian axis could send around 200 divisions to the battlefield at the start of a major war, and that Italy currently has 10 million people for the organization of around 50 divisions. The remarks of the British War Minister were not published by the official news agency, and the evening newspapers did not disclose them either. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>US Congressmen Support President's Proposal; Movement to Repeal Neutrality Act Gains Momentum; Freedom to Take Retaliatory Action Against Countries That Breach Agreements and Hinder US Interests</h3>
<p>(Washington) The movement in Congress to repeal the Neutrality Act has gained momentum, which is noteworthy because after the Neutrality Act is repealed, President Roosevelt will have more freedom to take retaliatory action against countries that violate treaties and hinder American interests. (AP, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The movement to amend the US Neutrality Act appears to be gaining traction today. After President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the Neutrality Act not only does not help peace but also promotes war, Democratic Senator Lewis today introduced a bill in the Senate to repeal all neutrality-related regulations in federal law so that the government can have more freedom to take retaliatory measures against countries that exclude American commerce and hinder American interests. At the same time, both isolationists and internationalists are supporting Lewis's motion. For example, Republican Senator Johnson stated that he would gladly support any legislative action to repeal the Neutrality Act and expressed surprise at President Roosevelt's previous remarks against the Neutrality Act. (AP, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The issue of amending the Neutrality Act has now become the central issue on the Congressional agenda. If Congress can pass an amendment to extend the "cash and carry" provision to include military supplies, the government would likely be satisfied. However, some people, such as former Secretary of State Stimson, advocate that the US government should openly express its position and support the democratic countries, and they would not be completely satisfied with such an amendment. However, the government's intention is to effectively assist Britain and France in fighting against the dictatorships. It is almost certain that the government will not ask too much as long as the above amendment can be voted and passed by Congress, because after the principle of "cash and carry" is fully implemented, the British and French navies will be able to control maritime traffic and their financial resources will be sufficient to pay for the goods in cash, so they can obtain all the necessary items from the United States without any difficulty, giving them an advantage over the totalitarian states. The current Neutrality Act is scheduled to expire on May 1st of this year, and people close to the State Department and the White House are optimistic about the Congressional discussions. The reasons are: first, President Roosevelt's remarks to the press yesterday that the Neutrality Act does not contribute to world peace have been widely echoed; second, Democratic Senator Barkley of Kentucky made a speech yesterday, strongly arguing that American foreign policy should not only protect American security but also maintain world peace, which was well received by the opposition; third, after Congress passed a portion of the military expansion bill by a large majority, it is evident that a majority of Congressmen are willing to pursue an active foreign policy, thus making it necessary to amend the current Neutrality Act; fourth, former Secretary of State Stimson, a Republican, also sent a letter to the New York Times yesterday, publicly advocating that the United States should take "affirmative action" against fascist countries, thus excluding the issue of foreign policy from domestic political disputes. Based on this, President Roosevelt has gained sufficient support in public opinion and can use the opportunity to amend the Neutrality Act to directly attack the isolationists. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>US-Brazil Talks Conclude</h3>
<p>(Washington) Talks between US government representatives and Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha have concluded. The US and Brazil have reached an agreement, and Aranha is scheduled to return home tomorrow.

<h3>Japan's Financial Difficulties; Implementation of Inflation; Government Proposes to Parliament; Triple Increase in Paper Money</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The adverse impact of the Sino-Japanese War on the Japanese economy was further demonstrated today. Due to financial difficulties, the Japanese government today submitted a proposal to Parliament to increase the issuance of paper money by the three major Japanese banks by 40% to 60%. That is, the issuance of paper money by the Bank of Japan will be increased from 1.7 billion yen to 2.2 billion yen, the issuance of paper money by the Bank of Korea will be increased from 100 million yen to 160 million yen, and the issuance of paper money by the Bank of Taiwan will be increased from 50 million yen to 80 million yen. The proposal stipulates that this measure will be abolished within one year after the end of the Sino-Japanese War. The proposal was presented in the form of an amendment to the Bank of Japan's issuance limit. (AP, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japan Borrows to Raise War Funds</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Minister of the Army reported in Parliament yesterday (8th) that the Japanese government will issue 5.6 billion yen of public bonds in the near future. At the beginning of this year, Japan had already issued 4.1 billion yen of public bonds, of which 3.6 billion yen was used for temporary military spending. It is now reported that the Japanese government plans to issue another 6.8 billion yen of public bonds in the second half of this year to fund the war against China. Since the "China Incident" occurred, the Japanese government has already issued 5.1 billion yen of war bonds. (Express News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Four-Year Production Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Aoki Kazuo, Director of the Japan Planning Department, who stated in Parliament today, after the implementation of the four-year production expansion plan for the "Japan-Manchukuo-China" currency bloc, Japan will be self-sufficient in raw materials such as iron, steel, coal, zinc, railway vehicles, automobiles, ships, as well as light metals, sulfur, wood pulp, ammonia, and soda. According to Aoki, based on 1938, after four years, by the end of 1942, the production of raw materials in the three-nation yen bloc can be increased by the following figures: iron by 250%, steel by 60%, coal by 30%, copper by 80%, lead by 90%, zinc by 70%, natural oil by 30%, chemical oil by 3000%, wood pulp by 20%, wool substitutes by 320%, automobiles by 500%, wool by 340%, locomotives by 30%, railway passenger cars by 70%, railway freight cars by 50%, and gold production by 20%.

<h3>Tokyo to Broadcast Television Films</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, the Japan Non-Wire Broadcasting Company will broadcast television from Tokyo in April. This will be the first time in Japan. The broadcaster is a television laboratory in the suburbs of Tokyo. Department stores in central Tokyo and other crowded places will be able to receive these television films. The broadcasting and receiving organization will use Japanese materials exclusively, and its broadcasting machine is a modified version of a film projection organization that can broadcast 25 films per second.

<h3>Soviet Union Actively Prepares for War; Seen from Trade with the United States</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to statistics released by the Department of Commerce today, people here believe that the Soviet Union is currently saving its exportable goods in preparation for a possible war. Soviet exports to the United States have greatly decreased, mainly being stockpiled for domestic use and use during wartime. In addition, the total value of Soviet purchases from the United States reached $69,691,100, an increase of 62% compared to US exports to the Soviet Union in 1937. (AP, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Armed Forces Protect Fishing Areas</h3>

<h3>French Newspaper Reveals News: Hitler Plans to Oppress Britain and France; Plans to Seize the Opportunity to Invade the Borders of the Netherlands and Switzerland; To Use as a Threat for Italian and German Territorial Expansion</h3>
<p>(Paris) Pierre Bernus, a diplomatic reporter for the right-wing L'Époque, recently declared, "I have learned about the plan that German leader Hitler intends to implement this year. This plan was originally scheduled to be implemented this month, but there may be a postponement. The main points are as follows: (1) Take preliminary actions in all aspects to weaken the position of the democratic countries of Western Europe, such as the Japanese army occupying Hainan Island, Italy conducting an anti-French propaganda campaign, Italy increasing the number of troops stationed in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, the Italian garrison in Italian East Africa putting pressure on the border of French Somaliland, instigating incidents in the Syrian Republic and Palestine, and the Italian army mobilizing. (2) Once the Spanish Civil War ends, Italy should formally make demands on France, and at the same time, Leader Hitler should deliver a speech in support of Italy, and in the form of an ultimatum, make demands for Germany, or even seize and occupy the Netherlands and Switzerland with lightning speed, thereby forcing the democratic countries of Western Europe to immediately yield. However, he should declare that the seizure and occupation of the Netherlands and Switzerland is a temporary measure, and if the Western European countries engage in negotiations at that time, he should make demands on them." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Italy Plans to Make Four Demands to France</h3>
<p>(London) German Aviation Minister and Dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, General Göring, is currently resting in southern Italy. It is reported that before returning to Germany, he will accompany an important Italian figure to France to mediate between France and Italy and present Italy's demands. According to reliable sources in Rome and Berlin, Italy has given up territorial demands on France, and its demands will be limited to the following four items: (1) The legal status of Italian expatriates in French Tunisia in North Africa should be restored to the 1896 system, in other words, these expatriates should enjoy a certain degree of autonomy in Tunisia; (2) The port of Djibouti in French East Africa should be designated as a free port, allowing Italian goods to be imported duty-free, as Hamburg does for Czech goods; (3) Although the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway, built by French merchants, should be jointly managed by France and Italy in the section within French territory; (4) Italy should be allowed to send representatives to participate in the Suez Canal Board of Directors, and the passage fees paid by Italian ships should also be reduced.

<p>Warsaw: Well-informed sources say that Polish authorities hope to start digging a canal connecting the Baltic and Black Seas in the shortest possible time. The canal will pass through the Vistula, San, Dniester, and Prut rivers. A senior official of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gwalewski, recently went to Paris, London, and The Hague, his purpose being to contact the three countries to borrow money in order to realize the project. The Polish authorities also discussed the matter with the Romanian Foreign Minister, Gavrilescu, when he came to visit earlier. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Defense Committee Confident in Its Ability to Quell Unrest; Remnants of the Communist Party Still Hold Out; Government Troops Send Aircraft to Bomb</h3>
<p>Madrid: After the Military Committee issued a final ultimatum to the Communist troops today, the Communist troops have now surrendered. Officers of the Republican Army headquarters declared that the situation in the main center of the disturbance is now under control, and there has been little sign of a "war within a war" since this morning. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The local Non-Wire Radio Station recently issued a broadcast message stating that the remnants of the Communist Party are resisting, and the government army has dispatched aircraft to bomb them. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Non-Wire Radio Station affiliated with the National Defense Committee recently issued a broadcast message stating that the remnants of the Communist Party who were resisting surrendered yesterday, but have risen up again today. The National Defense Committee originally wanted to stop the unrest with humane means, but it was ultimately ineffective. In order to maintain the security of the city of Madrid, it has no choice but to use aircraft and artillery to sweep them away. All citizens should know that the National Defense Committee has exhausted all means to advise the Communist Party members to stop fighting, but because the Party is stubborn, it is using force to suppress them. It is estimated that the unrest will be quelled within a few hours. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>The National Education Conference Concludes Yesterday; Passing Chairman Chiang's Address as the Supreme Guiding Principle for Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Third National Education Conference, which began on the 1st, concluded at 3 PM on the 9th, lasting a total of nine days. The conference held ten plenary sessions. The first, second, and third sessions were dedicated to reports on the state of educational facilities from representatives of provincial and municipal education departments and schools. Chairman Chiang also attended the third session on the 4th to deliver an address. The conference discussed proposals, including those submitted by the Ministry of Education regarding improvements to education at all levels, as well as over 300 proposals from various representatives and over 100 suggestions from various parties attending the conference. The conference also passed a temporary motion to adopt Chairman Chiang's address at the conference as the supreme guiding principle for education in China moving forward, truly demonstrating the enthusiasm of all representatives in supporting the leader. At the closing ceremony, Secretary-General of the Conference Zhang Daofan first read the conference declaration, followed by Chairman Chen Lifu's closing remarks, which stated, in essence, that the representatives at this conference provided concrete suggestions for improving education, which will serve as guidelines for future educational implementation and make a significant contribution to national education. The Ministry of Education, during the First National参政會 (National Political Council) Conference, proposed implementation plans for education at all levels for discussion. During the Third National参政會 Conference, the Ministry of Education also presented two plans for educational administration. The improvements to education at all levels submitted by the Ministry of Education at this National Education Conference are concrete measures based on the aforementioned principles. Many valuable suggestions were also made in the various proposals. The resolutions passed will have a significant impact on future educational facilities. The Ministry of Education will make every effort to implement the resolutions and strive to achieve them as soon as possible. Following Vice-Chairman Jiang's speech, President Kong was invited to give instructions, stating in essence that the conference discussed various proposals, including focusing on promoting compulsory education in primary education, emphasizing the implementation of practical work subjects in secondary education, emphasizing student internships in normal education, implementing a tutor system in higher education, and striving for universal sports and military training plans, all of which are significant improvements to education in the future. Regarding educational administration, the government will find ways to reasonably resolve issues such as central subsidies for public education in various regions and enriching library facilities in various schools. Future education should be guided by the Three Principles of the People for revolutionary nation-building, as indicated by the supreme leader. He hoped that everyone would base their efforts on this direction and actively dedicate themselves to the great cause of building the foundation for the war of resistance and national reconstruction. Finally, Chairman Chen gave a response, and the meeting adjourned at 6 PM. (9th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Declaration of the National Education Conference: Raising Academic Standards to Meet the Needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction; Strengthening School Education to Cultivate Social Cadre Talents</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The declaration of the Third National Education Conference is as follows: At a time when the national crisis is urgent and enemy troops are deeply entrenched, the Third National Education Conference is held in Chongqing, the seat of the National Government, to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth review of national education issues and study ways to improve and strengthen it, so as to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. This conference not only recognizes the importance of its mission, but also deeply understands the difficulty of its responsibility. In this period of inconvenient transportation, the members participating are not only from the southwest, but also from the northeast, not only from the front lines of our army, but also from behind enemy lines. The number of attendees at this conference is even greater than the previous two education conferences. This is precisely because we are all driven by a strong national "national consciousness". The nine full days of meetings, sometimes day and night, not only allowed us to fully recognize and discuss many important proposals, but also to listen to and understand the situations in many regions. These reports are not only the knowledge we should have, but also our own education. We have carefully discussed all proposals, and everyone has a spirit of knowing everything and saying everything. When we research and discuss, we dare not let the concept of the needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction and the future of the nation and the people leave our minds. We firmly believe in Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s saying that the foundation of revolution lies in profound knowledge, so we pay great attention to the improvement of higher education. We pay attention to raising academic standards, especially to ensure that science education can be integrated with the great cause of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. General curriculum standards will be revised. In order to equalize the national cultural level, there are regulations on the regional distribution of university education and normal education. In order to promote the training of senior and intermediate technical cadre talents and eliminate the erroneous psychology of social contempt for occupations, it was decided to have a five-year vocational school system for junior high school graduates. Secondary education is the backbone of young people's character and academic development. We have proposed improvement plans that not only focus on the training of vocational and production talents in secondary education, but also take into account the foundation of talent education. Therefore, the six-year unified secondary school system will be given the opportunity for simultaneous experimentation. The appropriate division of secondary school normal and vocational education areas is precisely to avoid the disadvantages of excessive establishment and lack. Elementary schools are the universal foundation of national education. The quality needs to be improved, and the quantity needs to be increased. It is necessary to ensure that all school-age children have elementary schools to attend. The implementation of compulsory education must not be suspended due to the war, and should be actively expanded. Short-term elementary schools are planned to be expanded from a one-year system to a two-year system. The treatment of elementary school teachers should be improved urgently. During the War of Resistance, the consciousness of resistance should be strengthened, and we must give the hard-working people who lost their schooling in childhood extensive educational opportunities. We plan to enrich the facilities of social education and actively promote adult literacy education and electrical education. Art education, which is related to the cultivation of national spirituality, should also be promoted. We must not forget our vast borders. To secure the borders, we must promote the culture of the borders. We must not forget our patriotic compatriots who are saving food and clothing to contribute to the country. We must start by improving the education of overseas Chinese to improve their lives and make them not forget the glorious culture of their motherland. What we are most concerned about are the enemy-occupied areas and the areas behind enemy lines. The youth in our war zones and the compatriots who want to receive national education are suffering greatly from the trampling of the enemy's iron hooves and cannot receive normal national education. We can say responsibly that the country will never forget them. We have plans to actively promote them all. As for the teachers in these areas, especially the arduous struggle of primary and secondary school teachers and their spirit of sacrificing their lives for the country and the nation, we are not only moved, but also worthy of the respect of compatriots across the country. From the perspective of issues related to all parties, we believe that the organization of central and local education administration at all levels should be sound, the efficiency should be improved, the funding should be stable, the curriculum of schools at all levels should be focused, spiritual, and more reasonably coordinated, the facilities of various social education should be appropriately related, the health and nutrition of children and youth should be taken care of, and physical education should be emphasized, so that children and youth are healthy, lively, and enterprising, and the future of the nation will be more hopeful. The Boy Scouts and military training are not only good education for physical training, but also good education for cultivating responsibility, discipline, and all organized life. Military training methods should be improved, and military management must be implemented. The supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, told us, "The new life is the wartime life." If we do not implement wartime life during the war, when should we wait? Everyone knows the importance of teachers, so we must respect teachers, and at the same time, we must cultivate teachers and carefully select teachers, so that the quality of teachers is the backbone of promoting school moral education. The school moral education system must be sound, and those engaged in education are irrefutable truths. As for the protection of teachers at all levels and the opportunities for further study, we believe that they are indispensable conditions for improving teachers. The above is just a large part of the resolutions. We believe that education is not only limited to schools, but is a scope for the entire people. We also believe that there must be sound school education to have sound social cadres. We must all break through the national crisis and establish a strong and unshakable foundation for the country, and we must think about the cause of education, which is a century-long plan.

<h3>British-Japanese Negotiations in Hong Kong: Resolution of the Bombing of the Luohu Case; Japanese Text Expresses Apology and Compensates for Losses</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Luohu incident on the Hong Kong-Kowloon border, which attracted worldwide attention, involving the bombing by Japanese aircraft, has been resolved after the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, repeatedly lodged serious protests with the Japanese government, and the Japanese side agreed to apologize and compensate for all damages. British and Japanese sides immediately instructed relevant officials to conduct negotiations near the location of the incident (Hong Kong) to seek a resolution. After receiving this instruction, Ando, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese invasion of South China, dispatched his Chief of Staff, Tanaka, on the 1st from Guangzhou aboard the transport ship Chitose-maru to Hong Kong to formally apologize to the British authorities in Hong Kong for the Luohu incident and to represent the Japanese side in negotiations with the British side. At around 11 AM on the 2nd, Tanaka disembarked from the Chitose-maru and, accompanied by his adjutant, traveled by car to Government House to meet with Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote, offering an apology to the Governor and holding a brief discussion before leaving. He then went to pay respects to Naval Commander-in-Chief Noble and Army Commander-in-Chief McNaughton. At around 1 PM, the British Naval and Army Commanders-in-Chief and the Governor's representative, Smith, also visited the Chitose-maru in return. At 3 PM, Tanaka, representing the Japanese military authorities, went to the Colonial Secretariat to conduct negotiations on the Luohu incident. The British representatives present were Colonial Secretary Smith, Police Commissioner Henry, Director of the British Section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, Walker, and Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters, Neville. In addition to Tanaka, the Japanese representatives included Consul-General of Japan in Hong Kong, Kotta Takio, Colonel Miyazaki, Lieutenant Colonel Taihei, and Captain Yamada. The negotiations lasted only 40 minutes before concluding. Regarding the content of the negotiations, both the British and Japanese sides maintained strict secrecy, and only after the event did the Hong Kong Colonial Secretariat issue the following announcement: "Lieutenant General Tanaka paid a visit to the Governor this morning, representing Commander-in-Chief Ando, to express his apology for the Luohu incident on February 21st. The Governor replied that he was very grateful for General Ando's dispatch of his Chief of Staff to Hong Kong for negotiations and expressed his satisfaction with the proper handling of this incident by both governments. Regarding the issue of compensation for the loss of British lives and property, consultations were held at the Colonial Secretariat this afternoon." A second announcement was issued later that evening, stating in essence that "the Japanese text has agreed to the compensation for losses, with a maximum amount of 20,000 yuan." On the morning of the 3rd, British and Japanese representatives held a second round of negotiations on the British warship "HMS Dauntless". The representatives present from both sides remained the same. The negotiations began at 10:30 AM and lasted until 11:30 AM, lasting one hour. After this round of negotiations, the so-called Luohu incident can be considered to have come to an end. As for the content of this negotiation, both sides remained silent. However, according to sources familiar with the matter, in addition to discussing how to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, it also involved general issues between Britain and Japan in South China, such as the opening of trade. However, it was also heard that the negotiations on this point did not yield much results. At this point, the Luohu incident, which caused a sensation in the Far East for a time, was completely resolved. The Japanese representatives and the British authorities exchanged courtesies, while sending telegrams to their respective governments for instructions. Once their respective governments have replied, both sides can formally sign the agreement. Therefore, Japanese Chief of Staff Tanaka left Hong Kong on the 6th aboard the Chitose-maru and returned to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>The Trial of the Lin Baisheng Assault Case Opens in Hong Kong; Defendant's Attitude is Relaxed</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Lin Baisheng assault case has officially begun its public trial at the Central Magistracy in Hong Kong. At around 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, the atmosphere in the Central Magistracy's courthouse was already tense, with a continuous stream of people arriving to observe the proceedings. The trial began at 2:30 PM. Lin Baisheng, accompanied by two burly men providing protection, arrived at the court. On that day, Mr. Lin wore a navy blue silk cotton robe, a black French-style cap, and glasses on his nose, and walked slowly with a cane in his hand. The defendant was a painter named Chen Xilin, whose attitude was relaxed and showed no signs of fear. At the start of the trial, the judge first stated the cause of the case, followed by Dr. Gurney of the Maryknoll Hospital, who took the stand to testify about the extent of Lin Baisheng's injuries. Then, the judge questioned Lin Baisheng. Lin testified that he was the founder of the Nan Hua Daily News on Hollywood Road and currently serves as the general manager of the newspaper. On January 17th of this year, at 5:00 PM, he was descending from the Chung Tin Hong building when, as he stepped out of the arcade onto the road, he suddenly felt someone attacking him from behind and from both sides. He quickly continued for a few steps before collapsing. He vaguely recalled that someone had touched his eyes and felt blood flowing out. He heard a Western woman shouting "Ambulance!" and then became unclear. As for the felt hat presented in court today, it was the one he was wearing at the time of the incident, but it was quite intact at the time and not torn. He had never met the defendant standing in the dock and did not recognize him. After Lin Baisheng finished his testimony, Dr. Hua of the Maryknoll Hospital's electrotherapy room took the stand to testify. Dr. Hua happened to witness Lin being knocked down that day, but could not identify the assailant. At this point, the presiding judge announced that the trial would be postponed until 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 6th of this month for further questioning. As for the defendant Chen Xilin, who is twenty-seven years old and from Guangdong, he faces two charges: 1. Assaulting Lin Baisheng on January 17th with intent to murder; 2. Assaulting Lin Baisheng with intent to cause bodily harm. As for the injuries sustained by Lin Baisheng at the time, there were a total of six locations: three on the back of his head, one on the outer corner of his right eye, and two on his head. The wound on the outer corner of his right eye was the largest.</p>
<h3>Construction Department Stipulates Implementation Steps: Fujian Province Repairs Inland Water Conservancy; Dredging of Shoals Between Yong'an and Qingliu Completed; Water Diversion for Wasteland Reclamation to Commence Soon</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Province, bordering the sea in the southeast, is located on the front lines of national defense. The northwest is mountainous, making production and transportation extremely inconvenient. In order to actively promote local production and construction and enhance the province's economic strength, the Provincial Construction Department is focusing on inland self-repair water conservancy and farmland water conservancy projects, as well as blasting open dangerous river shoals, in order to facilitate transportation and make agriculture more prosperous. Since the beginning of July 27th, although the progress of water conservancy projects has been limited by financial resources and has not been perfect, there have been considerable achievements. Here is a summary of the progress made by the construction authorities: (1) Farmland water conservancy projects: The counties of Yong'an, Liancheng, Nanping, Shaxian, and Jian'ou have begun construction. The implementation method is based on the suitability of the terrain and water flow, and investigations are carried out. In Ansha, Yong'an, dikes are built to prevent flooding and reclaim wasteland. In Gekou, Liancheng, Shuidong, Shaxian, Yanxi Chiling, and other places, water diversion is used to reclaim wasteland. In Chuyang, Nanping, dikes are built and water is diverted to irrigate fields. In Fengle, Jian'ou, water is stored to reclaim wasteland. In Qixing Street, Jian'ou, and Baxiang Township, Nanping, mechanical irrigation methods are used. Farmland water conservancy supervisory offices have been established in various places, and special commissioners are assigned to be responsible for guidance and management. At the same time, outstanding farmers' children are recruited in various counties to set up classes to train farmland water conservancy technology to enrich the supervisors of farmland water conservancy projects. All projects are handled by laborers in various counties. As for other counties, survey teams are also being assigned one after another to conduct surveys first for design purposes. (2) Shoal blasting engineering method: All blasting has been completed in six Longtan shoals between Yong'an and Qingliu, and the Jianshi Andan shoal. The work in progress includes the Tanxi shoals in the Qingliu and Songxi rivers, and the Duohua Qigu Longtan, Tai Ninglu Jie shoal, which have now been surveyed and can be blasted soon. After completion, shipping will be more convenient. (3) Embankment gate project: The construction of the embankment gate project in Marong Township, Minhou has been completed. The repair of the embankment after the flood in Longxi Tianzhen has also begun. The construction of the dam in Fuqing Yangdan has been largely completed, and personnel have been sent to handle the completion. (4) Other engineering aspects: (A) Chang Lezhu irrigation field office, opened the Guantianyang waterline, added water restriction projects, and repaired the right-line canal, and added wood piles to protect the embankment; (B) dredging of the Minjiang River downstream Beigang Mawei and Gu Shan straight dam, the front-line port project in front of the third lighthouse; (C) continued dredging of the Minjiang River downstream Beigang waterway; (D) Taining Reclamation Office to handle wasteland water diversion projects, all Chennei, Dabu, Dian Shang, Meikou, He Shang, Pai Er, Wang Wan, and other places have been completed by the first survey team. Design completion, construction can be started soon. Checking the setting of gates and building dams, blasting shoals and digging ports are the four methods of sorting out waterways. The Minjiang River's three major streams have dangerous waterways and difficult freight transportation, so the local agricultural products cannot flow smoothly. The sorting out of waterways is a matter of urgency. Since the war began, the government has actively promoted land reclamation for the sake of increasing food production. Fujian is a province with insufficient food, and land reclamation work is especially urgent. In order to seek the success of reclamation, it is necessary to develop water conservancy for agricultural land first, otherwise, it will inevitably be plagued by water and drought disasters, which will be laborious and fruitless. Now that the Construction Department has actively carried out the two tasks of waterway rectification and farmland water conservancy, and has achieved considerable results, it is hoped that it can raise more funds in the future and carry out this project to the end.</p>
<h3>Wang Naicang Deeply Regrets His Past Mistakes; Suzhou Puppet Police Defect</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Wang Naicang, captain of the 5th Company of the 2nd General Police Force of the puppet Jiangsu Province, previously served as the captain of the Jiading County Security Force. After the Chinese army moved west, he was forced to surrender temporarily due to the cutting of his return route. He stationed his subordinates in Xiyongchang, Suzhou. Recently, due to the increasing suffering of the people in Suzhou, he deeply regretted his past mistakes. On the 5th of this month, he led his troops to defect. He secretly requested Commander Xiong of Changshu to send personnel to count the guns and equipment of his unit. Therefore, the Japanese army has been heavily guarded outside Suzhou city in recent days.</p>
<h3>Finance Greatly Improved; Zhejiang in the Midst of Recuperation and Education; Huang Shaohong Speaks in Guilin</h3>
<p>Guilin Correspondence: History tells us that Zhejiang has always been a base for revenge and revitalization of the country. Anyone who has dabbled in ancient Chinese history will be able to tell the story of the rise and fall of Wu and Yue. Under the great pen of historians, this story constitutes the greatest and most perfect textbook of the nation and the country, which has been used by oppressed nations and countries in the universe for thousands of years as a lesson for the future.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese swept through the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou triangle on the East battlefield, and the Chinese have held firm on the south bank of the Qiantang River, more than a year has passed. During this period, the Japanese initially entered a state of semi-sleep in this aspect of the war due to strategic relations, and finally due to insufficient strength. The Chinese side took the opportunity to reorganize its troops, recuperate, and educate, just like the Yue Kingdom when Goujian was released from the vicinity of the Gusu Terrace. At that time, the Yue Kingdom's territory stretched from Haikou in the north to Gumo (Chongxian) in the south, from Gou Yong (East China Sea) in the east to Zui Li (Jiaxing) in the west. This territory of 800 miles in length and breadth is also equivalent to the current Ｘ war zone's positions and guerrilla areas in Zhejiang. The Japanese situation and the Chinese countermeasures are even more in line with what Fan Li said to Goujian: "To plan for the country to defeat the enemy, observe its signs. Now Wu is using the power of the princes to command the world, but they do not know that their virtue is thin and their grace is shallow, their path is narrow and their grievances are wide, their power is suspended and their wisdom is declining, their strength is exhausted and their power is broken, their soldiers are frustrated and their troops are retreating, and their people are scattered. I ask Your Majesty to press our troops and reorganize them, and wait for their defeat to attack them. Without bloodshed, Wu's monarch and ministers will be prisoners. I wish Your Majesty to hide your voice and not see your movements, but to observe their stillness." When the author visited Huang Shaohong, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in Guilin and talked about Zhejiang's provincial administration, I became more excited about this historical fact.</p>
<p>Although King Goujian of Yue's sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, deep planning, and accumulation of efforts were one of the reasons for destroying Wu and restoring the country, if he did not have Fan Li, who was "clear and knew the inside", and Wen Zhong, who was "far-sighted and saw the outside", to give him great assistance in politics, then it would be difficult for anyone to give a definite answer as to whether King Fuchai of Wu would agree to his "bare shoulders and kneeling". Therefore, winning the political victory is a prerequisite for winning the military victory. Although Zhejiang is far behind the Japanese, it is in danger of being surrounded and attacked by the Japanese, but it also has the convenience of rising up to attack and succeeding in one fell swoop. Huang Shaohong used to be in charge of internal affairs, and now he is in charge of Zhejiang. His hard work and practical spirit have long been watched by all parties. From his speech, we can not only understand the current situation in Zhejiang, but also seek signs of the future.</p>
<p>The politics of Zhejiang Province is progressing with the evolution of the situation. At present, the provincial administration is advancing towards the following six goals: (1) self-defense mobilization, (2) military service, (3) financial mobilization, (4) improving rural institutions, (5) adjusting products, and (6) controlling transportation. "Self-defense mobilization" is to mobilize armed people and make the people automatically arm themselves, to defend villages, towns, counties, and regions in a passive way, and to directly participate in the war of national liberation in an active way. Now, in addition to the self-defense forces of villages, towns, and counties in Zhejiang, each county and region has a self-defense regiment, which can already be used centrally. Although this inevitably increases the burden on the people slightly, it has gained the understanding of the public. This huge popular armed force is the vanguard of sweeping away in the future counter-offensive.</p>
<p>The slogan of financial mobilization is "give money if you have money," but it does not necessarily mean asking someone to give money. The rich areas of Zhejiang are in Jiahu Hangfu. Since they were captured one after another, these 13 fallen counties, although only accounting for a little less than one-sixth of the province's 75 counties, must be said to be a very large loss in Zhejiang's financial budget. After a period of reorganization, such as eliminating corruption and increasing consumption tax rates, fiscal revenue has increased by one-fifth compared to the original revenue. Therefore, Zhejiang has a budget that has never exceeded 30 million yuan in previous years, and this year it has jumped to more than 40 million yuan. This financial miracle is enough to give a demonstration to the financial authorities of various provinces. At the same time, it tells the Chinese people that China's finances are not "there is no way," but "there is no way to do it."</p>
<p>The most noteworthy is the work of "improving rural institutions". The governments of each district and county in Zhejiang Province are now attached with "Political Work Guidance Offices", training university or middle school graduates to engage in publicity to the public, explaining and promoting the work of government decrees. Their position is between the government and the people, as a medium between the government and the people. At present, there are no fewer than 4,000 people working in various districts and counties in the province. On average, there are two political workers for every 10,000 people in Zhejiang. Their working principle is "centralized application" and "responsible in districts". They work for three weeks a month and train for one week, which is constantly learning, working, experimenting, and improving. It can be said that it is the best education method and working method. The port of Wenzhou has not been blocked by the Japanese and is now the only route for coastal trade and transportation. Daily necessities imported into the interior via this route from Shanghai via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are very crowded. In the past, there were unavoidable Japanese goods that were repackaged and labeled. Those who transported them to the interior for profit now have seven checkpoints between Wenzhou and Jinhua that specialize in inspecting these Japanese goods. If they are found, they will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>The Desolation of Xuzhou: Puppet Officials Don Their Guises; Rampant Banditry in Southern Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: Xuzhou was originally formed by the merger of Tongshan and Xiaoxian counties, hence its vast jurisdiction. It occupies a strategic position on the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways and has historically been an important military town. Since its fall last year, the devastation it has suffered is no less than that of Nanjing and Zhenjiang. To this day, the market is depressed. Datong Street and Gongming Street were once the most prosperous areas in the county, with various shops lined up closely, but now they are a scorched wasteland. The South Gate and Horse Market Street still have some semblance of a market, mostly small restaurants and grocery stores. Cigarettes are nowhere to be found; most people smoke native tobacco. Smuggled goods are everywhere. Military scrip and the Central China United Bank's banknotes fly around, but the people refuse to use them. The Bank of Korea recently set up an office in Xuzhou. The puppet Xuzhou Public Security Maintenance Association, instigated by the Japanese, and the maintenance associations of various counties under Xuzhou are also under its control. It was then reorganized into a puppet Xusi Special Zone Commissioner's Office, abolishing the traditional New Year's Day and officially establishing a puppet provincial office in Xuzhou. The puppet office head is Li Haichun, the secretary-general is Wang Xianglin, the head of the civil affairs section is Su Genian, the head of the finance section is Zhang Liguang, the head of the culture and education section is Zhou Zhiye, and the head of the construction section is Liu Zhenwu. The advisor is Cao Ziqing. The puppet mayor of Xuzhou Municipal Government is Zhang Yunsheng, the advisor is Yang Shilan, the secretary-general is Xu Huibo, the head of the first section is Wang Jiasheng, and the head of the second section is Zhang himself. The municipal government has four bureaus under it. The puppet police chief is Yang Shixu. There are also finance and public works bureaus, but the head of the finance bureau has not yet been appointed. Tongshan County Public Office was also carved out and established, with Li Haichun as the puppet magistrate, and Wang Shaoqing and Zhang Weiru as puppet section chiefs. Zhang Guishan is the head of the political police team, and Xie Shoushan is the head of the Xuzhou Security General Corps. The puppet judicial organs, originally the Xuzhou Civil Tribunal, have now also been changed to the puppet Tongshan County Court, with Wang Ruisheng as the puppet president. Generally, all the big and small puppets are celebrating their promotions. The puppet district offices and township offices have also been established. The people suffer from the exploitation and oppression of the puppet government and live in dire straits, unable to see the light of day. In the area bordering Xuzhou and Xiao, and in the southern part of Xuzhou, including Xulou, Qingshishan, and other large and small villages, banditry is exceptionally rampant. Although the puppet security corps has three to four thousand people, their weapons are poor and they dare not leave the city to suppress the bandits.</p>

<h3>Chen Lijiang Discusses China's Education Over the Past Year (I): The Misfortunes of the Cultural World Are Unbearable to Recall, But There Is Hope for the Revival of New Education in the Future</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) Mr. Chen Lijiang, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, recently discussed China's education over the past year. He spoke in great detail about the various ways in which China's education has been devastated by the invaders over the years, as well as the Ministry of Education's various plans and implementations for renovating education after the war. Here is a record of it (the following is all in Mr. Chen's words):</p>
<p>China in the past year has been continuing the struggle against the invasion of the tyrannical enemy, and fighting even more bravely and resolutely. In China, which has undergone such a process, everything is changing rapidly, and therefore her education is no exception.</p>
<p>Looking at the enemy's destruction of our education, China's education this year is truly unbearable to witness and even more unbearable to speak of. This year, in our Great Rear Area, the enemy, based on its consistently vicious policies, has airplanes bombing wildly every day, and educational and cultural institutions are, as usual, one of their main targets for bombing. The areas bombed include not only educational and cultural institutions in Central China, such as Huachung University in Wuchang, but also educational and cultural institutions in South China, such as National Sun Yat-sen University. Not only were coastal educational and cultural institutions such as Xiamen University bombed, but also educational and cultural institutions in Central China such as Hunan University. Not only were educational and cultural institutions near the war zone bombed, but also Kunhua Normal School in Yunnan, far in our southwestern frontier. The means of bombing are even more brutal than in the previous year. For example, the bombing of Hunan University involved twenty-seven airplanes, divided into three teams, invading the skies above Mount Yuelu and densely dropping forty to fifty bombs, many of which were incendiary bombs, causing the entire library of Hunan University to be destroyed, two-thirds of the science building to be destroyed, and three student dormitories to be destroyed. What remained were only broken walls and ruins, and the essence of the entire school was reduced to ashes. The loss of one school is like this, so the losses suffered by the various cultural institutions from Central China to South China, from the coast to the central region, and from the war zone to the frontier, cannot be measured.</p>
<p>Even educational and cultural institutions in the rear area, far from the war zone, have been subjected to such crazy bombing by the enemy, so it is not difficult to imagine the depth and magnitude of the destruction of educational and cultural institutions in and near the war zone this year. Especially when we have to voluntarily abandon a certain stronghold for strategic reasons, the local education is completely destroyed, either by setting fire to the schools, such as Hangzhou Jianwu Middle School, burning them all to ashes, or by setting fire to the libraries, such as the Zhejiang Provincial Library, burning them all to ashes, or by massacring our school teachers and students, such as the murder of Zhao Tianlin, the principal of Tianjin Yaohua Middle School, and the assassination of Liu Zhanen, the president of Shanghai Hujiang University, which are just obvious examples. There are countless other intellectuals who have been massacred that have not been recorded in the newspapers and that we do not know about. The school buildings that were fortunate enough not to be burned down by the enemy were also occupied by the enemy as military camps, such as the various colleges and dormitories of National Peking University, which, according to reports, have become the enemy's stables and military camps. The books and instruments that were fortunate enough not to be burned down by the enemy were also smuggled back to their country by the enemy, or sold to shops for a few copper coins a bag to be used as leather bags, or burned as firewood at will. As for the teachers and students who withdrew from our war zone, the hardships they suffered along the way from wind, frost, hunger, and cold, displacement, loss of schooling, and loss of teaching cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>However, the deepest and greatest pain is above bombing, destruction, burning, and killing, and that is the implementation of incomparably vicious enslavement education in the occupied areas. We are not afraid of bombing because if the old is destroyed, the new will grow out of it. We are not afraid of destruction because the more we are destroyed, the stronger and more solid we will become. However, enslavement education is terrible, too terrible. It is something that kills without drawing blood. A son or daughter of the Chinese nation is finished if he or she is bewitched and anesthetized by enslavement education. Not only is he or she finished, but he or she will also become the enemy's beasts of burden and the enemy's running dogs. He or she will no longer hear the call of the motherland, no longer know the history of his or her own nation, recognize the thief as his father, and act as an accomplice of the tiger without knowing it. A nation is not afraid of being conquered by others militarily, but when it is conquered by others educationally and culturally, it can only be treated as human flesh on the chopping block, and we as fish to be slaughtered. The enemy has already begun to do this work in our occupied areas. For example, on April 4 of last year, various newspapers reported that the enemy, in our occupied areas, in addition to massacring our children, also captured them for education, in preparation for continuing their aggression in the future. The enemy even had the far-fetched idea of sending Gu Zhengzhi, the former ambassador to Austria, to Shanghai to preside over the motherland education, setting up education on the spot to avoid the labor of carrying them away to raise them. According to the story of the ancient cultural city reported by the Beiping News, and the report on the enslavement education in North China under the iron heel by the Tianjin News, it is terrible to say. To sum up the steps taken by the enemy to implement enslavement education in the occupied areas, the first step is to search (National cultural organs in Beiping), the second step is to burn and ban all kinds of books and newspapers related to our national consciousness, and to massacre our intellectuals, the third step is to recruit the scum among our intellectuals (for example, the enemy and puppets ostentatiously published an announcement in the Shanghai News about the joint office of various schools and colleges in Tianjin and Shanghai, registering the faculty and students of various schools and colleges in Tianjin who were exiled in Shanghai), and to train them in traitorous theories, the fourth step is to revise textbooks and curricula, deleting all the teaching materials about the Three People's Principles and national thought from our original textbooks, advocating the anesthetizing nature of reading the classics, and listing Japanese language as a compulsory subject, and the fifth step is to rebuild schools, recruit students, and implement enslavement education. In addition, they also advocated the softening and anesthetizing nature of the "Chinese Buddhist Association," founded various traitorous newspapers, suppressed foreign-run schools in China, carried out the absurd propaganda of "Wangdao Paradise" and "East Asian New Order," and deprived the people in our occupied areas of freedom of publication, assembly, association, and so on. The enemy's intention is nothing more than to use the tool of enslavement education to eliminate the national consciousness of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, to make each and every descendant of the Yellow Emperor thoroughly become a docile citizen of the Japanese Empire, no, to be cows, horses, and slaves, and to have you be cannon fodder to kill your own brothers.</p>
<p>In summary, from the perspective of the enemy's destruction, China's education this year has not only suffered great damage from the Japanese invaders, causing great pain and depth, but has also been greatly manipulated by the Japanese invaders, which is shocking.</p>
<p>From the perspective of our creation, China's education this year is the most commendable and the most exciting. China's past education had unclear goals, uncertain policies, complex theories, and divergent ideas. However, during this year, these shortcomings have been completely changed. In terms of educational goals, regardless of the government or the public, there is a unanimous direction towards forging loyal and brave soldiers for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, fighting the war while building the country. In terms of educational policies, Minister Chen has repeatedly declared that the three educations must advance in parallel, that literature and martial arts must be combined, that agriculture and industry must be given equal importance, that the educational goals must be consistent with the political goals, that family education must be closely linked with school education, that the essence of our country's inherent culture, which is embodied in literature, history, philosophy, and art, must be reorganized and promoted with scientific methods in order to establish national self-confidence, that natural sciences must be caught up with according to needs in order to meet the urgent needs of national defense and production, that social sciences must learn from the strengths of others and make up for our own shortcomings in order to seek everything that is suitable for the national conditions, that education at all levels must strive for clear goals and seek balanced development in various regions, that compulsory education must be popularized according to the original deadline, and that social education and family education must strive for planned implementation. The Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction also has the following provisions: (29) Revise the education system and promote wartime curriculum, focusing on the cultivation of national morality, improving scientific research, and expanding its equipment. (30) Train various specialized technical personnel and assign them appropriately to meet the needs of the War of Resistance. (31) Train young people to serve in the war zone and rural areas. (32) Train women to serve in social undertakings to increase the strength of the War of Resistance. Based on this policy, the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang also passed a general outline of the wartime implementation plan for education at all levels (to be continued).</p>
<h3>Difficult Fundraising for Educational Expenses: Satisfactory Results; Exceeding 100,000 Yuan When the Ten-Day Deadline Expires; Schools Urged to Remit Donations Immediately</h3>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association launched a fundraising campaign for the production and education expenses of refugees by promoting the sale of "Charity Badges." Starting on the first of this month, today is the last day. The cultural and educational circles of the city have been enthusiastically promoting it, and people from all walks of life have been actively donating. The results have been excellent. It is reported that the predetermined target of more than 100,000 yuan has been exceeded, and people from all walks of life continue to donate to the Bank of Shanghai to receive the badges. The association originally stipulated that if schools had surplus Charity Badges, they should return them to the association on the 9th. However, because the schools had to compete for the efforts of the last day, they mostly requested an extension until the 11th to return them. Yesterday, many schools applied to continue to receive Charity Badges. The association hopes that the donations raised by the schools will be remitted to the Bank of Shanghai immediately after the end of today for statistics, and to be used as a basis for awarding prizes, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Education Subsidy: 220,000 Yuan; The Approved Amount for This Year Increased by 60,000 Compared to Last Year</h3>
<p>When the Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting on the 8th of this month, it was resolved to allocate 220,000 yuan for subsidies to Chinese schools and 190,000 yuan for subsidies to foreign schools, as proposed by the Education Committee. The amount of this subsidy is more than that issued last year (the total amount last year was 160,000 yuan) because the number of students in each school was smaller last year.</p>
<h3>YMCA Relief for Impoverished University and Middle School Students; More Than 500 Students Received Assistance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has organized the Shanghai Student Relief Committee to help impoverished students, with Yang Yongqing, Miao Qiusheng, Zhu Peisi, Li Denghui, and others as committee members. They provide material assistance to general impoverished students who are determined to study and have a hardworking spirit. Students can apply regardless of religion or gender. After the association's strict review and testing, it can be approved. University students are limited to 50 yuan per person, and middle school students are limited to 30 yuan per person. More than 500 students have received assistance. According to the association, it subsidized approximately 11,000 yuan to students who received subsidies from the association during the summer and autumn of last year, totaling more than 500 people.</p>
<h3>Soochow University's Negotiations with the Japanese Side End; Regains Management Rights of School Buildings; The School Buildings of Jinghai, Xiuzhou, and Hugun Can Be Returned to Their Original Owners Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that yesterday (the 8th), it was learned that the 17-month-long dispute between the original American owners of Soochow University in Suzhou and the Japanese side has now ended. Today (the 9th), they will regain management of the school buildings, which are worth one million yuan. Jinghai Women's Normal School in Suzhou, Xiuzhou Middle School in Jiaxing, and Hugun Women's School in Huzhou, all of which were established by Americans, are also expected to be returned to their original owners by the Japanese army within two weeks. A five-person committee representing Soochow University and its administrator, the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church of America, went to Suzhou last week to reclaim the property. The school was forcibly occupied when the Japanese army entered Suzhou. The school authorities, the church, and the American government have repeatedly made requests, but the Japanese army ignored them and continued to occupy the property. However, the Japanese army has repeatedly allowed school personnel to transport out the school's equipment. Among the items that have been transported out are thousands of volumes of books and a large amount of scientific equipment. The five-person team is led by Dr. Shang Si, the acting president of the school, and is expected to return to Shanghai on Saturday or Sunday. Soochow University was established by the American Methodist Episcopal Church in 1903. Shortly after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the school moved from Suzhou to Tunxi, Anhui Province. Before classes could begin, the Japanese army had already invaded Anhui Province. Hundreds of faculty and students of the school moved to Shanghai and started classes in the Cishu Building with St. John's University, Jiang University, and Hujiang University. Dr. Yang Ge, the president of Soochow University, is now in the United States and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in early autumn to take office. Because the current situation in the Suzhou area is unstable, the school is not expected to use its original Suzhou site for some time to come.</p>

<h3>Western Union Football Referees Announced This Week</h3>
<p>The final of this Scott Cup Football Tournament, Lido vs. West Capture, is scheduled to take place tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium. Lido's forwards are sharp, and West Capture's defense is strong. There should be a fierce battle at that time. It is generally not a problem for Lido to win the championship. Although West Force's strong player McKellen has now transferred to West Capture, he is not included in the lineup for this battle. According to Mr. Dickson, the manager of the team, McKellen could have played in this game after transferring to West Capture, but it seemed unfair to add new players at the last moment. Therefore, it was decided to fight with the original team. The charity game the day after tomorrow, Donghua vs. Portugal, and the Zilin Cup quarter-final, French Army vs. North West Children, are also scheduled. In addition, there are eight other league games this week. The Hua team (Group A) will face West Force, the reserve team Donghua will meet St. Francis, and the Group B Qinghua will meet the British Navy. The appointment of referees for each game is as follows:</p>

<h3>Finance Severe Foreign Exchange Selling Occurs Due to the Establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund</h3>
<p>Foreign Banks and Exporters Frequently Sell Heavily, the "North China Puppet Bank" Also Cuts Significantly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange market experienced a sharp sell-off due to news reports that the Sino-British financial loan plan had been established. Foreign firms from Hong Kong, Sassoon, and Chinese firms like the Sha Hua gang aggressively sold large quantities. The "North China Reserve Bank" also aggressively cut its positions. In addition, foreign banks had weak appetites, so the market loosened considerably. However, Sassoon suddenly stopped selling and started buying, causing the situation to tighten briefly. Ultimately, demand could not keep up with supply, and the market could not sustain itself for long. In the end, both British and American exchange rates continued to soften, and trading was very active. As for the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, foreign banks and exporters were also aggressively selling, and foreign firms had weak appetites, so the downward trend was also severe, breaking through the 55-yuan mark.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London telegraphic transfers for both near and far dates were flat. New York silver prices and London gold prices also remained unchanged. In foreign exchange, the British pound depreciated against the US dollar by 1.2%, appreciated against the French franc by a small amount of 0.03, and appreciated against Shanghai by 0.0625. The US dollar appreciated against the British pound by 1.25%, appreciated against the French franc by a large amount of 0.0625, and appreciated against Shanghai by 0.15 yuan. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 8 shillings 2 1/875 for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous closing, both British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. After opening, foreign firms from Sassoon, Hong Kong, and Chinese firms like the Sha Hua gang rushed to sell aggressively, and banks' appetites were weak. As a result, the underlying trend was quite soft and cheap. Sassoon, Hong Kong, and the Sha Hua gang sold British pounds to Maccaroli, HSBC, and another bank, with the rate hardening from 8 shillings 2 5 to 3125. Subsequently, Sassoon, foreign telegrams, and Chinese firms also sold US dollars to HSBC and another bank, with the rate falling from 16.1875 yuan to 25. HSBC's listed prices and the announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Afterwards, Sassoon suddenly stopped selling aggressively and started buying, causing the situation to reverse and tighten. Sassoon bought British pounds from foreign banks, with the rate returning from 8 shillings 2 8125 to 21875, and US dollars from 16.1875 yuan to 0625. Later, telegrams from Hong Kong resumed selling, causing the market to soften and cheapen again. Hong Kong telegrams sold British pounds to HSBC for 8 shillings 2 8125. Later, telegrams also sold US dollars to HSBC and another bank for 6.1875 yuan. Near noon, a foreign bank, Anda, also sold Hong Kong dollars to a foreign firm for 95.125 yuan, so the process was also hard. At noon closing, bank selling prices were 8 shillings 2 8125 for the British pound and 16.1875 yuan for the US dollar.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, telegrams from Hong Kong continued to sell aggressively. In addition, the Tianjin gang ("North China Joint Reserve Bank," etc.) cut their positions at a loss, and Chinese banks also rushed to sell. As a result, the underlying trend became even softer and more flooded. Chinese banks and large Tianjin gangs sold British pounds to HSBC, Dutch Bank, and Anda, with the rate rising from 8 shillings 2 3125 to 34375. Subsequently, a foreign firm bought British pounds from HSBC for 8 shillings 2 325, and also bought US dollars from a foreign bank for 16.25 yuan. Later, the Chinese Sha Hua gang again sold US dollars to a Chinese bank for 16.3125 yuan. Finally, a Chinese bank bought Hong Kong dollars from an exporter for 55.75 yuan. As a result, the situation remained soft. At the evening closing, bank selling prices were 8 shillings 2 34375 for the British pound and 16.3125 yuan for the US dollar. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the British pound softened by 125, the US dollar hardened by 25, and the Hong Kong dollar also softened by 1 yuan, reaching 55.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Establishment of Exchange Equalization Fund</h3>
<p>Domestic debt rises by about one yuan; foreign debt rises more substantially, ranging from two or three pounds to one pound.</p>
<p>"Cooked red" drops by thirty-seven yuan, closing at two thousand and ninety-eight yuan.</p>
<p>The British pound rises by 125, to 8 shillings 2 34375; the US dollar rises by 25, to sixteen yuan three one two five.</p>
<p>British banknotes fall by five jiao and five fen; the British pound falls by six jiao; American banknotes fall by one jiao and two fen; and the American gold pound falls by five jiao.</p>
<p>However, peanut oil, due to Japanese puppet control, requires that drafts be sold to Japanese puppet banks starting tomorrow, causing a sharp increase of four yuan.</p>
<h3>Bullishness Lacking Interest, Cash Falls Expand, Breaking the Two Thousand One Hundred Yuan Mark, Resulting in a Sharp Drop of Thirty-Seven Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market conditions for cash "cooked red" in this city experienced another major storm. The downtrend suddenly turned more intense, with the decline as swift as a broken bamboo. It successively retreated into the four major levels of 2130 yuan to 2100 yuan. It once fell to a low of 2090 yuan, a staggering 110 yuan lower than the unprecedented peak of 2200 yuan last Saturday. While various groups of merchants were absorbing slowly, British and American economic aid to China became more active. The Sino-British loan has been established, financial security has been further consolidated, and foreign exchange has been dramatically softened by North China merchants (including the Joint Reserve Bank) and Chinese and Western speculators cutting their positions. Cash bulls were naturally lacking interest. Therefore, after a certain gold firm began selling, and the money exchange industry, acting on behalf of wealthy merchants, aggressively advanced, although securities firms, jewelry stores, and money exchange businesses bought in along the way, they were all profiting and buying on the rebound, and did not want to pay high prices, causing gold prices to further plummet. In the end, it fell sharply by another 37 yuan, people were extremely tired, and trading was busy, with volume exceeding 1,000 taels in the morning and afternoon. The market situation was slightly chaotic again, and jewelry gold dropped by three yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<p>"Cooked Red" Falls Miserably</p>
<p>Since the initial opening in the morning, upon hearing that the foreign exchange softening trend was quite severe, people became more tired, and sellers flocked, while buyers were scarce. As a result, the price broke into the twenty yuan level. Initially, a certain gold firm sold 100 taels to a money exchange business, and a jewelry store gang sold 50 taels, with the opening price at 2115 yuan, 20 yuan lower than the previous closing. After the opening, the foreign exchange suddenly stopped softening and turned tight, and people's sentiments were suddenly stimulated, and buying interest gradually intensified, and the price rebounded immediately. A jewelry store gang bought 50 taels from a cash firm for 16 yuan, a money exchange business bought 50 taels from a jewelry store gang for 18 yuan, and another money exchange business bought 50 taels from a gold firm for 20 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange business bought another 50 taels from a jewelry store gang for 24 yuan, and a certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from a securities gang at the same price. After that, the price suddenly reversed downwards, because the foreign exchange trend became soft again, and sellers flourished again. A securities gang sold 50 taels to a money exchange business for 21 yuan, the money exchange businesses traded 50 taels among themselves for 19 yuan, and the money exchange business sold 100 taels to a securities gang for 14 yuan and 12 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm came to aggressively sell again, breaking into the ten yuan level. The gold firm sold 50 taels to a securities gang for 08 yuan, and then sold 50 taels to a jewelry store gang for 10 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was still flat. Initially, a jewelry store gang bought 50 taels from a money exchange business for 10 yuan, and a money exchange business bought 50 taels from a gold firm for 11 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange continued to report softening and cheapening, causing buyers to become hesitant again, and the price fell sharply. The money exchange business sold 50 taels to a jewelry store gang for 05 yuan. Afterwards, more sellers emerged, not hesitating to sell at low prices, breaking into the hundred yuan level. A certain money exchange business sold 50 taels to a gold firm for 2090 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Afterwards, the gold firm continued to buy, so it rebounded. The gold firm bought 50 taels from a money exchange business for 96 yuan, and finally bought 50 taels from a money exchange business for 2098 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 37 yuan compared to the previous day (having fallen for four consecutive days, totaling 92 yuan). It was heard that after the closing, a certain money exchange business suddenly wanted to buy, and raised the price to outside the hundred yuan level, bidding 02 yuan to buy, but still could not find a counterparty, and it did not open. The cash firm's own-brand gold was sold for 2105 yuan and bought back for 2090 yuan. The current standard premium gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and gold firms did not open.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Down Three Yuan</p>
<p>Jewelry gold at jewelry stores, initially the selling price per tael was unchanged. However, around 9:54 AM, because "cooked red" opened 20 yuan lower, it was also lowered by one yuan accordingly. Later, around 2:55 PM, because the underlying trend of "cooked red" was even more tired, it was lowered by another one yuan. Later, around 3:27 PM, because "cooked red" broke into the hundred yuan level, it was lowered by another one yuan. Da Tong Hang and Lao Qing Yun, etc., changed to listing 113 yuan, and new shops also changed to listing 211 yuan, buying back for 205 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>A London cable from the 7th reports that the price of British pure gold per ounce is trending sideways, remaining at 7 pounds 8 shillings 2 and a half pence. As a result, the Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price also remains at 1209.9 yuan, and the listed customs gold also remains unchanged, calculated at 2.392 yuan. The Shanghai standard premium gold price also remains unchanged, calculated at 1205.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Unchanged</h3>
<p>A London cable from the 7th reports that after India bought in, it suddenly re-released a small amount, and the market was flat. After the closing, it remained stable, but later turned sideways. The telegraphic transfer silver for both near and far dates was unchanged. A New York silver cable reports that the spot price of US silver remains sideways. Also, a Bombay silver cable reports that the Indian silver market is calm, and both spot and futures prices are unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for drawn bills (per thousand yuan) remained stable. It was 47.75 yuan in the morning and then returned to 48 yuan in the afternoon, the same as the previous day's price.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Has International Protection, Foreign Currencies Experience Sharp Reactive Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies declined by 125. Since the establishment of the loan, sentiment in the foreign exchange market has been extremely weak. Foreign firms have been less willing to settle accounts, Sassoon and others have been aggressively selling, banks' absorption capacity has been sluggish, and the supply of foreign telegrams has been continuous. Market prices have been softening step by step, and the trend has been very hard. "Cooked Red" has been softening along with foreign exchange drafts, and gold firms and jewelry businesses have been emerging one after another. The Tianjin gang, due to the higher gold prices in Tianjin, which offer profitable opportunities, took advantage of the low prices to absorb and drag in, so it rebounded once, but because the foreign exchange draft softening trend continued unabated, it was difficult to maintain. The legal tender has international guarantees, the speculative period for gold has decreased, and investing in public bonds is a shortcut to profit, so people are selling them off to obtain legal tender, and gold prices are trending downwards again. The situation is very weak. Foreign currencies are affected by the softening of foreign exchange drafts and the decline in gold prices, making it difficult to gain a foothold. Wealthy individuals are selling them frequently, and buyers are becoming increasingly scarce. Under the downtrend, no one dares to collect them. Except for the application of payment for goods, there is no large-scale need for various currencies, causing market prices to decline across the board, resulting in a sharp reactive decline, which is unprecedented since the War of Resistance. Association transactions have decreased. Qin Tai sold and Yong Tai bought $500 in US dollar drafts; Ying Feng sold and Yong Tai bought 50 British gold pounds; Yong Tai sold and Hong Chang bought 50 British gold pounds; Qin Tai sold and Cheng Tai bought $500 in US dollar drafts. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds down 6 jiao, British gold banknotes down 5 jiao and 5 fen, American gold pounds down 5 jiao, American gold banknotes down 1 jiao and 2 fen, Hong Kong banknotes down 3 fen and 4 li, French franc banknotes down 2.5 li, Singapore banknotes down 3 fen, Dutch banknotes down 5 fen, Annam banknotes down 5 fen, Robi banknotes down 3 fen, Canadian banknotes down 1 jiao, and Philippine banknotes down 5 fen. Only Italian banknotes, German gold banknotes, and Siamese banknotes had no transactions and remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities Stimulated by the British Loan, Domestic and Foreign Debt Rise Sharply by About One Yuan; Foreign Debt Jumps by Two or Three Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for securities in the unofficial market were due to the report of joint action by the United States and other countries to provide economic aid to China, which had been reported in newspapers, and people's sentiments were extremely excited. Large investors bought in with increasing volume. The 50-yuan mark for Class C bonds has been approached twice, and although it has not been broken through, it is only a matter of time before it will be broken through. This is because after the success of this large loan, foreign currency public bonds have risen sharply by several pounds. It is heard that it has been decided to pay interest, and it has also been heard in the financial community that the seventh interest on unified debts will definitely be able to restore the original method of paying in legal tender in one lump sum. Since the War of Resistance, this is the greatest international sympathy that has been obtained, and the future of the War of Resistance will be very favorable. The issue of resuming trading at the exchange is only a matter of whether the stipulated price can be cancelled or revised; otherwise, there are no other issues. The bullish outlook for market prices is beyond doubt. The high prices of January 10th and the highest prices of May 4, 1938, are specifically presented again and listed below for reference.</p>
<p>Yesterday's transactions: the opening was due to Da Feng's efforts to buy, which was rumored to be on behalf of the Ge Bank, absorbing a total of about 600,000. Market prices gradually rose, and Class C bonds broke through nine yuan again, and then approached the 5-yuan mark. As a result of the selling of long positions in No. 35, it once rebounded slightly by 4 or 5 jiao, but because Tian Sheng, Run Li, Mao Da, and others still had strong appetites, and Da Feng continued to add to their positions, although Qia Feng Hang sold a lot, the price could not be stopped, and it rebounded by 3 or 4 jiao again. People's sentiment was extremely good, and the noon closing was already about 8 jiao to 1 yuan higher than before. The afternoon opening saw Da Feng Hang's absorption appetite still strong, and there was also a great need for No. 20. Other firms such as No. 15 and Mao Da Hang also had considerable buying. On the selling side, Xin Feng, Yong, and long positions emerged, and No. 5, Tong Kang, Lian He, and other firms sold slightly. Supply was already seen to be exceeding demand, and market prices were still extremely firm. Class C bonds were seen again at 49.9 yuan, approaching the 50-yuan mark. The closing situation was excellent, which was unprecedented since the War of Resistance. As a result, market prices rose unanimously again by 9.5 jiao to 1.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1.5 million yuan. A brief and clear table is listed below.</p>
<p>The two highest prices after the war are attached below:</p>
<p>(1) The victory in the Battle of Taierzhuang</p>
<p>(2) There is talk in Europe and America of economic sanctions against Japan</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of China Merchants Securities Exchange were traded at a price of 26.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn Speculation Shifts to Fine Yarn, Thread Prices Jump Seven Yuan Suddenly, 20-Count Yarn Falls Instead by Two or Three Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market started rising, then leveled off, and the trend remains gradual. The reason is that actual demand is increasingly slack, and various groups still lack vitality. Most opinions among industry insiders are bullish, so when prices are low, they come to absorb and drag in a few packages, and the market situation turns upward again. After prices are high, some people come to sell again, and the chips loosen slightly, and the market tends to decline. The fundamental problem is that actual transactions are too lacking, so although buyers' intentions are strong, they are still difficult to consolidate. The overall trend currently has not broken free from a state of circling and lingering. However, fine yarn thread prices are particularly strong due to many parties using seasonal relationships to pull and manipulate. Daily transactions are mostly among industry insiders, so the rising trend is particularly intense, having risen sharply by 30 to 40 yuan in three or four days. Once actual demand is slightly sluggish, the reaction will also be severe, and one must be wary of it.</p>
<p>Current yarn situation: at the initial opening in the morning, market sentiment remained sideways, but there were still inquiries for 32-count and 42-count fine yarn threads from customer parties, and market prices jumped 5 yuan. The 42-count Cat and Butterfly opened at 553 yuan, cash price, up 5 to 7 yuan from the previous day. Soon after, 32-count Heavenly Maiden also rose 7 yuan, to 537 yuan. The 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at 403 yuan, with little difference from the previous day; the godown receipt price was 400 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, it was heard that actual sales were not strong, and it fell back again. The 20-count Double Horse spot price was 402 yuan, and the godown receipt price traded at 398 yuan. In the afternoon, the momentum was slightly flat and tired, and actual demand was also scarce. The 20-count Double Horse fell back 2 yuan, trading at 400 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 397.5 yuan. As a result, it was found that various groups bought a total of 1,440 packages throughout the day. Market prices: 20-count Double Horse fell 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day, Heavenly Maiden fell 3 yuan, but 32-count and 42-count still rose 5 to 7 yuan. The factory opened 430 packages of 20-count Double Earth yarn from the Xin Yu Factory, priced at 399.5 yuan to 400 yuan, and also 200 packages of 10-count Double Earth, priced at 297.5 yuan to 298 yuan. Today, 700 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 120 pieces were shipped to Fuzhou, and 275 pieces were shipped to Ningbo. The amount of spot yarn purchased by each group is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Industry Insiders 1,110, Wenzhou 5</p>
<p>Shantou 75, Yunnan 45</p>
<p>Hong Kong 145, Tianjin 25</p>
<p>Zhejiang 5, Inland 10</p>
<p>Total 1,440 packages</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Market: demand from all parties is flat, but large players do not release their long positions. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon is 334 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix is approximately 328.9 yuan, down 1 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Expensive, Factory Purchases Weaken</h3>
<p>The raw cotton business is increasingly sluggish, because prices are too high, and factories have no intention of procuring. At the same time, although fine yarn thread prices are advancing step by step, 20-count yarn prices are weakening. In this situation, factories also have no intention of procuring much of the expensive raw material. However, because inventory is low, although there is an unfavorable environment shrouding the market, prices are still difficult to loosen. However, according to some news, foreign cotton block corners have fallen, and the converted price per dan is more than one yuan lower than the previous day, and various factories have a stronger desire to purchase foreign cotton for replenishment. As for when the goods will arrive, there is hope that they will arrive at the end of the month. 8,600 packages of Yao flower cotton have arrived. The amount of spot cotton traded and market conditions are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Indian cotton is being continuously transported. It is heard that the British company Alipore is shipping more than 6,640 tons of cotton from Mumbai, totaling more than 28,000 pieces, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Monday (the 13th). They are all procured by Japanese merchants. Another 1,000 tons were originally scheduled to be shipped to Japan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Heavyweight Coarse Cloth Market Continues to be Firm, Local Inventory is Empty, and the Source from the Da Sheng Factory is Cut Off</h3>
<p>The market for domestic cloth and various goods has ups and downs. White goods and coarse cloth from Chinese factories, weighing 14 pounds and 16 pounds, have recently had very smooth spot sales. Furthermore, the Nantong Da Sheng Factory has been forced to stop production, cutting off the source, and the Shanghai inventory is empty, so the market continues to be firm. Each piece has risen by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The trend of lightweight coarse cloth remains flat. There is strong demand from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi gangs for Yong An Factory's Da Peng fine cloth, and there is a shortage of spot goods. Yesterday's opening price was 13 yuan, a sudden increase of 1 jiao and 5 fen compared to before. Cannon Car and Wealthy and Noble brands, etc., rose by 5 fen. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi gangs had a larger appetite, trading several hundred pieces of fine cloth, fine materials, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, and other goods. The Guangdong gangs traded 150 to 160 packages of 16-pound Earth coarse cloth, various factory coarse twill, and fine twill. The demand for goods for the season from various places in the Min province, Fuzhou, Yangkou, and Shaxian, is also gradually developing. The Dian gangs are shipping goods increasingly frequently, and the warehouses still feel insufficient. The Chengdu gangs' purchases are also small and scattered.</p>
<p>East Cloth's fine cloth and fine twill rose in the morning and fell back in the afternoon, and selling prices were unchanged. However, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth had more floating amounts among retail investors, and the price was extremely chaotic, and the trend continued to soften. In the morning, it once fell sharply to 11.875 yuan. The Tianjin gangs took advantage of the low prices to search for more than 200 pieces, and then it immediately rebounded to 9.5 jiao. Dyeing factories on this street, because the trend of colored twill was good, procured 500 pieces of various brands of fine twill yesterday, so the price of fine twill was firmer. Fine cloth, with medium- and low-grade Lei and high-grade Yanghe being firm, Yanghe's market price still requires 12.15 yuan. Continuing to have 500 to 600 pieces of various brands of fine cloth sold to this street, few are opening shops. Only Dong Mian Foreign Firm wrote out 100 and several dozen packages of 12-pound Blue Chicken fine cloth for the April term, with the price per piece being 11.85 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, 255 pieces of piece goods were exported to Ningbo, 43 pieces were shipped to Fuzhou, and 135 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Drafts Rise, Cotton Prices Fall, Large Foreign Cotton Trades Occur</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market opened weak in the morning. There were widespread rumors in the market that Washington would release loan cotton early, so there were no buyers in the market. Southern parties were selling short and long positions were closing out strongly, so market prices fell sharply by 11 to 15 points. The Indian market had been in unofficial trading for the past few days, so market prices were uneven. Since the exchange officially opened for trading yesterday, the market situation has been brought into order. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell sharply by 2 Robi, and Egyptian cotton fell by 35 points. Because the loan was successful yesterday, foreign exchange softened sharply, with recent months at 8 and a half pence per shilling, US dollars at 16.25 yuan, and Robi at 46.5 yuan. Converted into legal tender, cotton prices all fell by 2 or 3 yuan. It is estimated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton each fell by 2.1 yuan per dan, Indian cotton fell by 2.3 to 2.6 yuan per dan, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transactions: because foreign cotton prices fell sharply, which was much more cost-effective than domestic cotton, yesterday's transactions were unusually lively, especially Indian cotton. In recent days, Shen Xin Factory has purchased more than 10,000 packages of Indian cotton. When the purchase was made, it coincided with the Indian cotton exchange suspending trading, and market prices could not be brought into order. At that time, cotton prices were at their peak in nearly six months. It is heard that a huge transaction was signed, totaling about 50,000 dan. The day before yesterday, cotton prices fell sharply, by about 3 or 4 yuan per dan. The amount of foreign cotton traded yesterday and the factory price of foreign cotton after conversion are listed below.</p>

<h3>Grains: Most Japonica Rice Reaching the Price Ceiling; Large Shipment of White Rice Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, First Since the Lunar New Year; Volume Exceeds 14,000 Bags; Negotiations Underway for Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Sources of Du Rice from various guilds are gradually increasing; the price of rice from the He Xia area arriving on the 7th, including cart-pulled rice and bagged rice, is 7-8,000 bags, but public sentiment remains high. Local businesses and hoarders are still actively buying, so the market is tight again, and a continued muddled situation is seen. As a result, high-quality thick-grain Japonica rice has reached 14 yuan again, while mid-grade rice has increased by 2-3 jiao. The situation with Du Yang and superior grade rice is similar, all at 14 yuan. Rice from the Bund area is priced at 13.56 to 13.8 yuan, also an increase of 3 jiao. The price of Bai Yuan rice has not changed, but the quality appears mixed, and it is difficult to distinguish between mid and lower grades.</p>
<p>The purchase of Xian rice by both local customers and hoarders is brisk, with another 7-8,000 bags transacted throughout the market, and prices have increased by 2-3 jiao. Wu Xian rice has reached 13.2 yuan, and Gao Jing Xian is quoted at 13.5 yuan. Several hundred bags of foreign rice were offered yesterday, with Saigon rice reaching 16.5 yuan. Although foreign firms' orders have not been finalized, both sides are in negotiation. Recent external fees are 17.3 yuan, while inclusive fees are close to 18 yuan. This price is difficult to reach, but since current stockpiles are not abundant, there are plans to hold out for better prices.</p>
<p>Since the Lunar New Year, the supply of rice has been cut off. According to rice merchants, there is still a lot of rice stored inland, but due to the heavy taxes imposed by the Japanese puppet regime, it is unbearable, causing rice merchants to hesitate. Although there are still stocks in this city, there are fears of shortages, so rice prices have gradually risen recently. The Rice Industry Association has issued a notice regarding price limits, but all rice types have reached the limit. A reporter learned that yesterday morning, the Taikoo Yangxing Wuhu ship imported 14,049 bags of white rice from Hupou. This is the first import since the New Year, and it is hoped that rice prices can stabilize on their own.</p>
<h3>Cheap Dumping of Foreign Flour</h3>
<p>The flour market is nominally firm but actually loose. Retail sales from various guilds are still fairly active, but due to the continuous arrival of foreign flour in small batches and the dumping of flour at low prices, the prospects for local flour are quite affected. Therefore, flour prices have gradually become chaotic in an intangible way. According to manufacturer sources yesterday, factory prices have been divided into three types for several days. On the surface, prices have not loosened, but in reality, covert prices for local merchants are still 4.7 yuan, 4.7 yuan for the Nanyang guild, and only 4.65 yuan as a special price for the Beiyang guild. A total of over 10,000 bags were traded by both the Southern and Northern guilds throughout the market. Due to the inconsistent factory prices among local merchants, trading volume is not high. "Further News": The market price of foreign flour is gradually declining and is already equal to the selling price of local flour. Futures for March and April are even cheaper, selling for only 2.5 US dollars, totaling only 4 yuan per bag. Yesterday, 2-3,000 bags were traded in the local market. Given this environment, the flour market has been almost completely seized by foreign goods. Today, 12,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Fuzhou, and 1,000 bags to Tianjin. In addition, 200 bags of bran are being shipped to Fuzhou and 1,000 bags to Ningbo.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships at the Jiaojiang Estuary Bombard Haimen Again; Chinese Troops Stand Guard; Japanese Warships Do Not Dare to Penetrate Deeply, Only Destroying Several Civilian Houses and Killing or Injuring Two Civilians</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side notified the consulates of various countries stationed in Shanghai, claiming that they would take military action in Haimen, Zhejiang, and from the 18th of last month, four Japanese warships have twice harassed the Jiaojiang estuary in Haimen, shelling the shore. After the local garrison bravely fought back and inflicted heavy damage, the Japanese warships quietly sailed away from the blockade line. Since then, although they still patrol outside the estuary from time to time, they have not taken any further action. Therefore, order in Haimen has returned to normal. Foreign merchants' transport ships are also planning to resume sailing, but the Japanese side is using the excuse that the military action is not yet complete, so they are still preventing foreign ships from sailing to Taiwan. According to a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency, who inquired with the shipping industry, at 10:35 AM the day before yesterday (the 8th), two more Japanese warships approached the blockade line at the Jiaojiang estuary. Immediately, they shelled the shore indiscriminately. The Chinese garrison, considering that the Japanese warships' shells were aimless and mostly fell on wasteland, stood guard and ignored them. Knowing that the Chinese side was prepared, the Japanese warships did not dare to penetrate deeply. After firing more than 30 shells, they sailed away from Jiaojiang. An investigation afterward revealed that only a few civilian houses were destroyed, and two civilians were killed or injured. There were no other losses, so the local situation remains peaceful, and the people are extremely calm. As for the resumption of the Shanghai-Taiwan line, it will be impossible to achieve for the time being.</p>
<p>Registration for Dredging Waterways and Shipping</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has granted the request of shipping merchants to allow foreign transport ships to resume sailing to Haimen. Starting from March 1st, ship registration will be reprocessed, and the garrison will dredge the Jiaojiang waterway, leaving one channel open on the Jiaojiang blockade line. Ships passing through must send personnel to guide the ships. The other blockade line built by Japanese warships in Jiaojiang will be destroyed. All ships sailing to Haimen have complied with the order to re-register and are preparing to send ships to sail on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, etc. The Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has forwarded the request to the Second Army Group for approval.</p>
<p>Counties Ordered to Investigate and Arrest Bandits</p>
<p>All coastal areas of East Zhejiang are heavily garrisoned by the Ningbo and Taizhou Defense Commanders, who have constructed defensive works and are under strict guard to prevent any incidents. In view of the fact that pirates in East Zhejiang have colluded with certain parties, claiming to be a certain allied army, and have repeatedly attempted to launch riots in East Zhejiang to disrupt the rear's security, the leaders of the bandits have already been arrested and executed according to the law. Now, in order to eliminate bandits, orders have been issued to the county governments to offer rewards for the investigation and arrest of bandits. Regardless of who it is, anyone who captures and sends in a traitor who is interrogated and found guilty will be rewarded with 100 yuan. Anyone who provides information leading to the arrest will be rewarded with 50 yuan. Anyone who reports and exposes an organization of traitors will be rewarded with 100 yuan. Anyone who knowingly hides traitors and fails to report them will be severely punished according to the law if they are exposed by others.</p>
<h3>Government Borrows Ten Million Pounds Sterling to Fill Exchange Equalization Fund; The Value of the Legal Tender and Foreign Exchange Will Become More Stable and Consolidated; Black Market Exchange Rates in Shanghai Have Unanimously Eased</h3>
<p>Since our government successfully controlled foreign exchange, the legal tender has ample reserves, and the statutory exchange rate has been maintained consistently. The foreign exchange on the black market has also been stabilized. Now, a loan of ten million pounds sterling has been established with four banks, including HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, to create an exchange equalization fund. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After Successful Foreign Exchange Control</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance implemented foreign exchange control from March 14th last year, stipulating that if banks require foreign exchange for legitimate purposes, they must apply to the Central Bank after offsetting receipts and payments. The aim is to break the "United Reserve Bank" banknote exchange for legal tender to profit from foreign exchange and to manage the foreign exchange required for imports to achieve international trade balance. The restrictions on the sale of foreign exchange are used to control the escape of domestic funds. In addition, measures for merchants to export goods and settle foreign exchange have been promulgated to promote the export of local goods to replenish the foreign exchange fund. The statutory exchange rate for British pounds is one shilling and two and a half pence, and for US dollars, thirty US dollars. Since then, foreign exchange has stabilized, merchants have reduced many unnecessary losses, and import and export trade has gradually shown a prosperous phenomenon.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Stability of the Statutory Exchange Rate and the Black Market</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance, agriculture, industry, and commerce have suffered extremely severe devastation. The difficulties in the lives of people in the war zones have reached their extreme. In the rear provinces, due to obstructed transportation and financial turnover and the supply and demand of materials, they have become increasingly difficult. The government is deeply aware of this and is determined to maintain the credit of the legal tender with all its strength. To maintain the credit of the legal tender, the first step is to stabilize foreign exchange. Therefore, since the war of resistance, the statutory exchange rate has remained the same. As for foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, it has also been stabilized in cooperation with the British HSBC Bank. The policy of controlling foreign currency and maintaining the credit of the legal tender has gained the faith and praise of Chinese and foreign figures. Although the issuance of legal tender has increased after the war, cash reserves have increased instead, fully complying with the regulations for the issuance of legal tender. Monthly inspections are publicly announced to demonstrate great trust.</p>
<p>Borrow Ten Million Pounds to Serve as a Fund</p>
<p>Now, in order to maintain the credit of the legal tender, stabilize foreign exchange, and ensure commercial transactions, so that exchange rates have a reasonable and solid foundation, it has been decided to allocate ten million pounds sterling as a fund to stabilize the legal tender. Arrangements have been properly made with the British government and two British banks, HSBC and Mercantile Bank, as well as two of our own banks, Bank of China and Bank of Communications. The British banks, HSBC and Mercantile Bank, and the Chinese banks, Bank of China and Bank of Communications, will each undertake loans of five million pounds sterling. If there are any losses at the end of this fund, the Ministry of Finance will be responsible for compensation. The British government will guarantee the loans from HSBC and Mercantile. The term is tentatively set at one year. After the term expires, it can be extended for a certain period if agreed, but it can be repaid and terminated early if necessary.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange on the Shanghai Black Market Eases</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from foreign banking circles in Shanghai yesterday that since the Chinese government established an exchange equalization fund of ten million pounds sterling with four banks, including HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, to stabilize the legal tender and maintain foreign exchange, Chinese and foreign banking circles believe that the legal tender and foreign exchange of China will become more consolidated and stable. As a result, foreign exchange rates on the Shanghai black market have unanimously eased. Yesterday, the British HSBC Bank quoted the British pound at eight pence and the US dollar at 15.625 yuan, but the actual transaction exchange rate was 8.25 pence for the British pound and 16.125 yuan for the US dollar. Because the government's loan from HSBC, Mercantile, etc., was successful, there is a tendency for the exchange rate to ease further.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forcibly Occupy British Yarn Factory; Continued Negotiations; British Members of Parliament Raise Questions; Foreign Affairs Department Clarifies Attitude</h3>
<p>London, 8th (Reuters) - Labour MP White asked in the House of Commons today about the Shanghai Municipal Council's special group administered by the Japanese, asking Foreign Secretary Butler to explain the purpose and scope of powers of this group. Butler replied that he had not received detailed information about the powers of this special group, but he could tell the House with certainty that the administrative understanding established with the Japanese authorities did not harm the nature of the Council's powers. Conservative Party member Pollett asked about the reasons why the Japanese did not relinquish the British-owned yarn factories in Shanghai. Butler replied that although the Japanese authorities had been informed of everything by the British Consul-General in Shanghai, they still expressed doubts about the British ownership of three factories, while the fourth factory was located in Zhoujiazui and is currently occupied by the Japanese army and used as an office by the Japanese army transport team. The British side has recently negotiated with Tokyo again, and will continue to do its best to negotiate to ensure that the Japanese side returns the British factories as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Japan Implements Export Control in North China; Reportedly to Revise "Tax Rates" and Implement a "License System"</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the Japanese "advisor" to the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in Beiping informed the Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce yesterday (the 8th) that on the 11th of this month, new export controls will be strictly enforced on twelve important export commodities in North China. This is the initial step in fully controlling export goods from North China to overseas. After the new control system is implemented for one or two months, it is hoped that all other goods will be subject to control. In about three months, the puppet bank in Beiping will implement a license system for the entire foreign trade of North China. In particular, the current tax rates in the Japanese-occupied areas will be revised to enhance economic cooperation between Japan and North China.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds to Be Drawn Today; Government Still Finding Ways to Advance Payment</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that customs duties in the war zones had been seized, the Ministry of Finance issued a notice regarding future methods of compensating for customs duty claims. However, in order to maintain debt credibility, principal and interest payments on internal debts such as the Unified Bonds and the Reconstruction Bonds will be made as usual. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has been ordered to unify Type B bonds, long-term financial public bonds, and the reorganization of Guangdong financial public bonds. It has been determined that today at 10:00 AM, a lottery will be held to repay the principal. Type B Unified Bonds and long-term financial bonds are both secured by surplus customs duties. Now it has been decided that the government will advance payments as usual to ensure that principal and interest are paid on schedule, thus deeply winning the trust of bondholders, and the domestic bond market has rebounded unanimously. The seventh payment period for Type B Unified Bonds is July 31st, and the eleventh payment period for long-term financial bonds is March 31st.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council's Tax Increase Yesterday Caused Criticism; Japanese Residents Expressed Strong Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that the Municipal Council announced last night (the 8th) that it was unable to meet this year's expenditure and resolved to increase tax rates by 2% from October, which has already caused criticism from Chinese and Japanese people. This morning (the 9th), most Chinese taxpayers stated that the so-called wartime prosperity of Shanghai would be short-lived, and the Municipal Council's 2% tax increase would place an excessive burden on taxpayers. Today, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" criticized the Municipal Council's tax increase, saying that Japanese taxpayers, in addition to other taxpayers, would also suffer losses. Japanese residents will debate and criticize this, and that the land prices on the south and north banks of the Suzhou River are different, and the land rent in Hongkou should be reduced according to the true value of the land.</p>
<h3>Dasheng Yarn Factory Forced to Suspend Production; German Consulate lodges strong protest; Japanese Spinners' Association Discussing Raising Funds for Purchase; German Merchants Resolutely Refuse to Give Up Operating Rights</h3>
<p>The first, third, and second yarn factories of Dasheng in Nantong and Haimen, managed by the German-owned Ewo Yiyang Trading Company, were recently blockaded by the Japanese side and ordered to suspend production. The trading company has reported the situation to the German Consul-General stationed in Shanghai and lodged a protest. It is now learned that the Japanese Spinning Industry Association in China has convened various Japanese yarn factories to discuss raising funds to purchase and operate the factories. The following are the details obtained by a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency:</p>
<p>History of the Factory</p>
<p>Dasheng Textile Company originally had three factories: the first, second, and third factories. They were founded by Chinese merchants Zhang Jian and others. The first factory was opened in April of the Guangxu 20th year of the Qing Dynasty. The factory was located in Tangjiazha, Nantong, with a capital of 6.3 million yuan, 92,520 yarn spindles, 2,000 thread spindles, 505 looms, and more than 7,000 male and female workers. The sub-factory attached to the first factory was opened in October of the 13th year of the Republic of China. The factory was located in Jiangjiaqiao outside the South Gate of Nantong, with a capital of 1.5 million yuan, 19,508 yarn spindles, 240 looms, and more than 1,500 male and female workers. The second factory was opened in March of the Guangxu 33rd year of the Qing Dynasty. The factory was located south of Jiulong Town, Qidong (it was closed before the war). The third factory was opened in September of the 10th year of the Republic of China. The factory was located in Nanwan, Changle Town, Haimen, with a capital of 4.2 million yuan, 30,300 yarn spindles, 444 looms, and more than 2,000 male and female workers. These two factories have a long history and magnificent equipment, and they have a considerable position in the Chinese spinning industry. The yarn threads of various trademarks such as Peacock, Kui Xing, Dragon and Phoenix, Double Dragon, and Lion are sold throughout the country. Before the war, Xu Jingren was the chairman of the board and was responsible for presiding over the business. The capital of the two factories was entirely funded and established by domestic commercial giants, with no foreign investment. Their public accumulation funds also increased year by year, with the first factory accumulating 270,000 yuan and the second factory accumulating 85,200 yuan.</p>
<p>Outstanding Foreign Debt</p>
<p>When the two factories were first established, business was at its peak in the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China. Later, Japanese yarn factories sprang up in Shanghai and expanded extremely, competing to overwhelm Chinese factory owners. The two factories also buried themselves in construction, improved products, and ordered machinery from abroad, earnestly operating. Although the surface still tended to be stable, it was actually hit hard. The flow of funds gradually decreased. Until the "August 13th" Shanghai war broke out, the two factories were in a state of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. The amount owed to the German-owned Ewo Yiyang Trading Company for the purchase of machinery was very large. As a result, the factory authorities, firstly because of the oppressive environment, and secondly because they could not clear the foreign debt, did not hesitate to allow this career, which had been painstakingly planned for decades, to fall into the hands of foreigners. In the early days of the Sino-Japanese War, in order to protect its own rights and interests, the German merchant sent a German-based employee to request that a small team of German troops stationed in Shanghai be stationed in the factory for protection. Later, when counties along the Yangtze River fell and the war shifted west, Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai successively resumed work. As a result, the trading company went ahead and completed the reorganization for resumption of work for more than a year.</p>
<p>Japanese Coveting</p>
<p>Since the first and third factories of Dasheng were managed and opened by the German merchant Ewo Yiyang Trading Company, the Japanese were very dissatisfied. They originally wanted to seize the operating rights of the factory, but they had no way to realize it. However, they were still plotting and using various methods, hoping to destroy it. At first, under the guise of military affairs, they stationed more than 500 naval landing troops in the first factory in the southern district and the third factory in Haimen, and turned the second and third floors of the factory into garrison barracks, and set up a watch哨台 on the top floor with machine guns. The female workers working in the factory were arbitrarily teased and raped, while the male workers were requisitioned to transport ammunition and dig fortifications. If male workers returned home after work and were pointed out as guerrillas when they entered the factory the next day, they would be arrested and shot, or released after being proved by the factory. All of these things made the factory's operations unable to be free. In October of last year, the Japanese side proposed cooperation terms, which were rejected by the German merchant, resulting in a delay until recently, for nearly half a year. The Japanese side brought up the old matter again, but did not get results, so the Japanese side suddenly took decisive measures on the 2nd of this month to blockade the factory and ordered the suspension of work by Hama Moto Sazaburo, the head of the military intelligence agency stationed in Nantong, who issued an announcement. All male and female workers who remained working in the factory were expelled, and many Japanese troops were stationed around the factory buildings.</p>
<p>German Consulate Protest</p>
<p>After the Japanese side suddenly forced the two factories to suspend production by force, the German merchant Ewo Yiyang Trading Company believed that the Japanese side illegally blockaded the factory, hindering business. Based on the report of the resident personnel, they petitioned the German Consul stationed in Germany and lodged a strong protest, hoping to resume work as soon as possible and demanding compensation for losses. The matter is now being negotiated by the German consulate with the Japanese side. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency, the Japanese Spinning Industry Association in China convened a meeting of the heads of various spinning factories in Shanghai at the beginning of this week to discuss the acquisition of Dasheng Yarn Factory. When the reporter inquired with relevant parties, it was said that the German merchant's attitude was quite firm and he would never let go of Qin Hui Yiqi because of illegal obstruction. Therefore, the future of this dispute is still difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Merchant Ship Hailong Searched by Japanese; Passengers Greatly Alarmed Outside Jiaojiang Estuary in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Hailong, a vessel owned by the Portuguese merchant Atlantic Navigation Company, which sails the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, loaded goods and passengers from Wenzhou on March 6th and sailed to Shanghai. At about 6 PM on the evening of the 7th, when it reached outside the Jiaojiang Estuary, it was stopped by a Japanese warship patrolling the Zhejiang waters using flag signals. Japanese soldiers boarded the ship in a small motorboat to carry out an inspection. Because ships on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line usually sail outside, and this ship suddenly sailed inside, it aroused the suspicion of the Japanese warship. As a result, nothing was found, and it was only released on the morning of the 8th and sailed to Shanghai as usual. After arriving in Shanghai the night before, the ship reported to the company and loaded goods and passengers as usual yesterday to sail to Wenzhou. The ship's passengers had been greatly alarmed. It is said that the reason why the ship sailed inside from Wenzhou to Shanghai this time was because the inner voyage was closer than the outer voyage.</p>
<h3>Japan Exclusively Dominates the Shipping Industry in China; Greatly Affecting the United Kingdom; Monopolizing Shipping in North China; Controlling Inland River Ferries; Refusing to Open the Yangtze River and Obstructing Shipping from Various Countries</h3>
<p>Since Japanese warships blockaded the coastal ports of our country, state-run and private ships have been forced to suspend navigation. Japan wants to exclusively dominate the shipping industry in China, such as controlling inland river ferries in Central China, monopolizing shipping in North China, planning to open a Nanyang line, and refusing to open the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. The shipping industries of Britain and the United States in China have been affected. The following are the details:</p>
<p>The United Kingdom Ranks First in Shipping in China</p>
<p>In the coastal and inland river shipping industry in China, British shipping power ranks first. For example, in 1936, the number and tonnage of ships entering various ports in China from the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States were as follows: United Kingdom: 48,154 ships, 57,345,515 tons; Japan: 17,911 ships, 24,913,576 tons; United States: 3,973 ships, 3,771,479 tons. This proves that the strength of British shipping in China is more than twice that of Japan. However, the situation has changed drastically since the outbreak of the war. In 1937, the number of British ships entering and leaving China decreased by 12,831 ships and 21,239,720 tons.</p>
<p>Japan Attempts to Exclusively Dominate After the War</p>
<p>After the war, shipping merchants from Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and Pakistan purchased Chinese ships and tried their best to expand the shipping industry in China. However, Japan attempted to exclusively dominate the shipping industry in China, such as refusing to open the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, obstructing foreign ships from sailing to Funing in northern Jiangsu and Haimen in eastern Zhejiang, and unreasonably detaining and inspecting foreign ships. At the same time, in North China, they used special forces to monopolize shipping. In Central China, Japan has replaced the United Kingdom's position. Inland river ferries in Central China are controlled by Japan and operated exclusively. In addition to opening shipping routes from Shanghai to Xiamen, they are also planning to open a Nanyang route between Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The British Shipping Industry is Greatly Affected</p>
<p>Since the autumn of 1938, Japanese shipping in China has suddenly made rapid progress. The shipping industries of Britain and the United States in China have been greatly affected. For example, last year, the number of Japanese ships entering and leaving various ports in China increased to 5,473 ships and 6,484,620 tons, ranking second. In January of this year, Japan had 478 ships and 759,889 tons, while the United Kingdom had 304 ships and 840,302 tons. The number of ships decreased compared to Japan, and the tonnage was almost the same as Japan, which proves that the British shipping industry in China is gradually declining, while the Japanese shipping industry in China is gradually developing, which is obviously affected by Japan's exclusive domination of the shipping industry in China.</p>
<p>Dalian Japan Qing Expands Shipping</p>
<p>Japanese shipping in China and shipping in North China are controlled by the Dalian Steamship Company. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are exclusively navigated by the Japan Qing Company. The inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are monopolized by the Inland River Shipping Company. Today, the Japan Qing Company is expanding its shipping industry in China. In addition to illegally confiscating the ships of Chinese merchants, it has also newly built Jianghai ships of more than 1,000 tons and joined the coastal and middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River routes. The Japanese military authorities provide various conveniences, and the Japanese government issues shipping subsidies. Today, the Shanghai-Chongming line, Shanghai-Tongzhou line, and Shanghai-Yangzhou line are all operated by the Japan Qing Company. Ships from third countries are blocked. At the same time, it is said that Japan wants to build a modern port near Hong Kong, and today's shipping in Hong Kong will also fall into desperation.</p>
<h3>Restoration of Postal Services in Anhui; Temporarily Limited to Regular Letters, Express Letters, and Registered Mail</h3>
<p>Postal services throughout Anhui Province were suspended due to the war. Postal personnel from various bureaus were ordered to come to Shanghai and set up a temporary Shanghai office of the Anhui Postal Administration in Shanghai to continue handling postal services. It has been more than half a year. All personnel have left Shanghai and gone to Anhui in early last month to restore postal services in various districts and cancel the Anhui Postal Bird's Shanghai office. Various important documents have also been transported for use. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday that it has been four months since the preparation for the restoration of postal services throughout Anhui Province began last winter. Now the local situation in the province has become slightly calmer, and residents have returned to their original residences. In order to facilitate communication among the people, the Provincial Postal Administration has resumed postal services in peaceful areas such as Anqing (Huaining), Huaiyuan, Yongcheng, Hefei, Yicheng, Shucheng, Guangji, Yangxin, and other districts this month. However, it is temporarily limited to regular letters, express letters, and registered mail. Parcels and remittances are still difficult to resume due to traffic obstructions. There are detailed regulations for transportation methods and mailing times. It is also learned that the acceptance of small parcel mail to Sichuan Province has been suspended from yesterday and a notice has been issued stating, "From now on, the acceptance of all small parcel mail to Sichuan Province will be temporarily suspended. This is a special notice."</p>

<p>Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves Public Translation of Trade Associations: English Translation Should Be "Guild"</p>
<p>The translation of the English names of trade associations: Based on a proposal from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce from the year before last, the term "Association" was initially preferred. However, on December 30th of last year, the domestic flavoring manufacturing industry suggested that "Association" had too broad a meaning and that "Guild," with its implications of a trade association, was more accurate. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, considering that the matter concerned the public translation of all trade associations, wired the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now replied, stating, "We have received the telegram. After investigation, the English translation of trade associations should be 'Guild.' However, for trade associations in the banking industry, whose translated names have become customary, changes may be temporarily postponed. Please be informed accordingly."</p>

<p>According to the Continental Times, a group in China advocating neo-Zionism convened a meeting on Tuesday (the 7th) at the American Women's Club. Over two hundred Jews from the city attended. Mr. Bieko, a prominent figure in the Jewish community in China, chaired the meeting and strongly criticized the weak policies of Jewish leaders attending the Palestine Conference in London. A resolution was unanimously passed to telegraph London, condemning Dr. Weizmann, the leader of the old Zionist organization, and supporting Jabotinsky. Bieko and others delivered passionate speeches outlining the historical changes in Palestine, which were greeted with cheers from the attendees.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Plans to Establish a Beggar Asylum: Able-Bodied Should Be Forced to Learn a Trade</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, due to the large number of beggars within the concession begging along the streets, which is both unsightly and obstructs traffic, has been capturing them in districts and detaining them overnight before sending them to the suburbs. However, they soon regroup in Shanghai, making it difficult to manage. Since the war, their numbers have increased, mainly gathering in District A (the area of the Central Old Zha Chengdu Road Police Station) and District B (the area of the New Zha Gordon Road Jing'an Temple Road Putuo Road Police Station). As for District C (the area of the Hongkou Huishi Police Station), due to the special circumstances and sparse population, beggars are absent. Last month, District A captured over one thousand people, and District B captured over six hundred. Therefore, for the sake of tidying up the city, the Municipal Council has decided to establish an asylum for weak and old beggars. Preparations are currently underway. Once established, old and weak beggars will be housed in the asylum, and able-bodied beggars will be forced to learn a trade to clear the streets.</p>

<p>Fake "Fresh Pork Market" to Be Established: Pork Merchants Still Firmly Refuse to Participate: Willing to Suspend Business to Safeguard National Interests: Actively Opposing and Planning Responses</p>
<p>According to Xiandai She, a Japanese businessman named Sato, in collusion with traitorous merchants, is actively organizing a fake "Fresh Pork Market" in an attempt to monopolize the pork trade in the city. The fake organization began preparations in July of last year and registered with the fake "Department of Weixin Industry" and the fake "Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau." However, due to the strong sense of righteousness of all pork merchants in the city, they have firmly opposed and refused to participate, delaying its establishment. According to sources, under Japanese instigation, the fake "Market" has recently resumed activities, planning to build the market in the Yangshupu area, which will soon be completed. However, fresh pork merchants, for the sake of national interests and their own interests, will adhere to their established principle and vow not to participate. They are currently discussing countermeasures and actively opposing it. It is also learned that after the establishment of the fake organization, pigs transported to Shanghai from various places will inevitably be subjected to its organization of slaughter, collection of exorbitant taxes and fees, and monopolistic encroachment, leaving no means untried. Therefore, people in the pork industry would rather suspend business than participate.</p>

<p>大丈夫應精强力足　　何為而衰弱無能</p>
<p>A Real Man Should Be Energetic and Strong: What Causes Weakness and Impotence?</p>
<p>We who are husbands with wives bear significant responsibilities. Not only does the burden of the entire family rest on our shoulders, but the rise and fall of the nation is also our concern. A husband should be energetic and strong, striving to be proactive, only then can he handle his responsibilities joyfully. Indeed, for a strong man with abundant energy, marital life will be fulfilling, love will be deep, and children will be the crystallization of their love. The family they build together will be their happy nest. Therefore, his sole comfort will be his wife and children. What burden of family is there to speak of? In serving society, he can also be diligent and conscientious, increasing work efficiency and reaping rich rewards. Although such a husband cannot be said to have achieved the level of self-cultivation, family harmony, national ambition, and world peace, he can be said to have fulfilled his responsibilities and is worthy of being called a happy and fortunate man.</p>
<p>婚後的荒淫，縱慾與憂勞　傷之故，致精枯血竭，爆發着腎虧無能，精力渙散，發育不全，機能喪失，以及腦脹頭痛，健忘失眠，腰酸背痛，肢體疲憊等神經衰弱症象。則雖有如花美眷，亦全不發生興趣，但夫婦之道，捨不了靈肉關係，妻子當感覺寂寞之時，懷着滿腔熱情，丈夫若不能予以安慰，她怎能不失望地惱恨呢？在這種情形之下，夫婦間即不免發生一種不快的陰霾，這種陰霾，如不速謀掃除，會逐漸的昏暗下來，把他整個前途的光明和幸福吞沒淨盡！此外，在職業上亦因身體過弱，如何能心計巧算，耐勞克苦，在成功的途徑上邁進？必陷於失業窮困，家累重重！人生至此境地，其困苦之狀，殊有難以言喻者！</p>
<p>Extravagance after marriage, indulgence, and excessive worry damage the body, leading to exhaustion of essence and blood, resulting in kidney deficiency and impotence, scattered energy, incomplete development, loss of function, as well as symptoms of neurasthenia such as brain distension, headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, lower back pain, and physical fatigue. Even with a beautiful wife, there is no interest. However, the relationship between husband and wife cannot be separated from the spiritual and physical connection. When the wife feels lonely and carries a full of passion, if the husband cannot comfort her, how can she not be disappointed and resentful? In this situation, an unpleasant haze will inevitably arise between the husband and wife. If this haze is not quickly dispelled, it will gradually darken, engulfing the light and happiness of his entire future! In addition, due to physical weakness, how can he be resourceful, hardworking, and persevering in his career to advance on the path to success? He will inevitably fall into unemployment, poverty, and heavy family burdens! The hardship of life in such a situation is difficult to describe!</p>
<p>但上述病症，並不是不治之症，在今日醫學昌明的世界，更有特殊療法，何為而不知自愛，長此受苦？特效療法，即必須速服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，因此劑係由雄壯動物體中提取的生殖腺素所製成，品質純粹，藥性溫和，補力偉大，於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，上述各症必可於短期內完全治愈。惟有遺精者，須兼服『希米脫氏固精片』，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速！</p>
<p>However, the above symptoms are not incurable. In today's world of advanced medicine, there are special treatments. Why not love yourself and suffer like this for a long time? The most effective treatment is to quickly take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (Germinal Essence). This agent is made from gonadal hormones extracted from strong animals. It is pure in quality, mild in nature, and has great restorative power. After taking it, it can generate sperm, replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within a day and night. If you continue to take it, the above symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time. Only those with spermatorrhea need to take "Hymeto Spermostatic Tablets" at the same time to strengthen the spermatic orifice and stop leakage, then the effect will be even faster!</p>

<p>面黄肌瘦的青年人，據余治病經騐，十個中到有九個患遺精症，同時在十個遺精患者中，他們的病原，到有九個是起於自凟。自凟是青年人在春情發動期一種易犯的惡習，起始是因為體內荷爾蒙的刺激，和好奇心的衝動，但青年人的意志薄弱，明知其害，而不能制止二次三次的再犯。所以極易造成習慣。以後為『習慣成自然』的勢力所支配，惡習的改正甚難。及至年齡長大，經屢次的努力，終以戒絕了自凟惡癖，或减少了自瀆次數，但性機能已受摧殘，遺精症即繼之而起。</p>
<p>According to my medical experience, nine out of ten young people with sallow complexions and thin bodies suffer from spermatorrhea. At the same time, among ten patients with spermatorrhea, nine of them have their etiology originate from masturbation. Masturbation is an evil habit that young people easily fall into during the period of spring passion. It starts with the stimulation of hormones in the body and the impulse of curiosity, but young people's willpower is weak. Knowing the harm, they cannot stop themselves from repeating it two or three times. Therefore, it is very easy to form a habit. Later, dominated by the power of "habit becomes nature," it is very difficult to correct the bad habit. By the time they grow older, after repeated efforts, they finally quit the bad habit of masturbation or reduce the number of times of masturbation, but the sexual function has been damaged, and spermatorrhea then arises.</p>
<p>遺精一起，在我人體内最可寶貴的精液，就等於有了一個不能自主的漏巵．在初症象輕者，每於夜眠時因夢而遺，迨後無夢亦遺，白日亦遗，甚至在大小便時亦有將精液洩出者，這是由遺精加劇而至滑精與漏精了。江河之水雖日日東流，但水有循環，所以無乾涸之虞！今以生理上所產生少量的精液，而有如此大量的遺洩，能不枯竭？如精液枯竭，則必百病叢生。其最顯著者為腦衰體瘦，健忘失眠，心悸胆怯，腰酸背痛，腎虧無能，精力渙散，發育不全等症即不一而足。此種青年，如一旦結婚，不特在夫婦生活上不能盡其人道，致為妻憎恨，演出家庭間的悲滲！就是在職業上學術上亦如何能與人競爭，獲得優勝，必處於劣敗地位無疑！然遺精並不是不治之症，在今日昌明的醫藥界上，更有特效良藥的發明，即患者必须服『希米脫氏固精片』，則遺精即可根治，如因遺精己引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以培補腦腎，增益精血，必可於短期内完全恢復健康。若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等科學療法，必可保證治愈。</p>
<p>Once spermatorrhea occurs, the most precious semen in our body is equivalent to having an uncontrollable leaking cup. In the early stages, those with mild symptoms will experience nocturnal emissions due to dreams. Later, they will experience emissions even without dreams, during the day, and even during bowel movements, which is the progression of spermatorrhea to spermatorrhea and seminal leakage. Although the water of rivers flows eastward every day, the water circulates, so there is no danger of drying up! Now, with the small amount of semen produced physiologically, there is such a large amount of leakage, can it not be exhausted? If the semen is exhausted, hundreds of diseases will inevitably arise. The most obvious are brain decay and thin body, forgetfulness and insomnia, palpitations and timidity, lower back pain, kidney deficiency and impotence, scattered energy, and incomplete development. If such a young man marries, not only will he not be able to fulfill his responsibilities in married life, causing his wife to hate him and leading to family tragedies! How can he compete with others and win in his career and studies? He will inevitably be at a disadvantage! However, spermatorrhea is not an incurable disease. In today's advanced medical community, there are even more effective medicines invented, that is, the patient must take "Hymeto Spermostatic Tablets", then spermatorrhea can be cured radically. If spermatorrhea has caused the above symptoms, you must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to cultivate the brain and kidneys and increase the essence and blood, you will definitely be able to fully restore your health in a short period of time. If patients can personally come to this clinic for diagnosis by expert doctors, and then use scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>女性的乳峯萎癟　有妨健美和幸福  美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>Atrophied Breasts in Women Hinder Health, Beauty, and Happiness: Yao Chongpei, MD, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>據世界著名的生理學家兼美容專家Kamdeaning康德林，與婦科專家Donpison湯潑遜等在法國最近出版的一份『健康公報』上說『：女性的性情所以會孤僻，容顏所以會憔悴，曲線毫無。而與丈夫不和，或終身不獲一育，或難育而養育困難，這可說與胸前的一對乳峯，有着極大關係，如果聰明的丈夫，能夠體會到這些，及時運用進步的醫藥，使他夫人的乳峯高聳而有彈性，那我相信世界上夫婦勃　的事情，或甚至離婚的事情，一定可以減少，並且還能夠多生育幾個活潑伶俐的子女呢』。這段議論，真是含有至理，有功社會的不朽之作。</p>
<p>According to a recent "Health Bulletin" published in France by world-renowned physiologist and beauty expert Kamdeaning and gynecologist Donpison, "A woman's temperament becomes aloof, her appearance becomes haggard, and she has no curves. Discord with her husband, failure to conceive throughout her life, or difficulty conceiving and raising children are all closely related to the pair of breasts on her chest. If a smart husband can understand these points and use advanced medicine in a timely manner to make his wife's breasts tall and elastic, then I believe that conflicts between couples or even divorces in the world will definitely be reduced, and they will be able to give birth to several lively and intelligent children." This argument truly contains profound truths and is an immortal work that contributes to society.</p>
<p>按康湯諸氏的所有要這樣重視乳峯，便因為乳峯高聳而有彈性的女性，她們的卵巢機能必健全，新陳代謝作用必旺盛，所以臀部豐腴，曲線美妙，同時更因血液循臟的充暢，容顏自然嬌豔，性情亦復謙和而柔順，此種女性在家庭裏每為丈夫視同壞寶，雙方情愛彌　，生育還成什麼問題。反之，一個女子而如果乳峯萎癟，那不管她年紀怎樣輕，大都失去健美幸福，同時並罹白帶及月經不調等症，自然不能生育壯健的子女，甚至喪失受孕的能力，即使受孕，產生下來的胎兒，非但養育困難，且因母體的衰弱，其死亡也特別容易！</p>
<p>The reason why Kang and Tang and others place so much emphasis on breasts is that women with tall and elastic breasts must have healthy ovarian function and vigorous metabolism, so their hips are plump, their curves are beautiful, and because of the smooth blood circulation, their appearance is naturally delicate and their temperament is also humble and gentle. Such women are regarded as treasures by their husbands in the family, their love is even deeper, and what problem is there with childbirth? On the other hand, if a woman's breasts are atrophied, no matter how young she is, she will mostly lose her health, beauty, and happiness, and at the same time suffer from leukorrhea and irregular menstruation, etc., and naturally cannot give birth to strong children, or even lose the ability to conceive. Even if she conceives, the resulting fetus will not only be difficult to raise, but also because of the weakness of the mother, its death is particularly easy!</p>
<p>基於這兩個比例，足見乳峯在女性健美的上的重要了，然則已有此種缺陷的女性，將怎樣以謀補救呢？余曰：當遵康湯諸氏的建議，運用最新醫藥，最新醫藥為何？此不待言，即為中西醫師一致推荐的卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』了，此劑服後於一日間即能培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，使一切白帶不感，宮冷不　諸症，似燃犀燭怪，頃刻驅除淨盡，短期恢復女性應有的健美，而使乳峯高高聳起，姿態動人。</p>
<p>Based on these two ratios, it is enough to see the importance of breasts in the health and beauty of women. So, how can women who already have this defect seek remedy? I say: You should follow the advice of Kang and Tang and others and use the latest medicine. What is the latest medicine? Needless to say, it is the ovarian preparation for women "Shengzhisu" (Germinal Essence) unanimously recommended by Chinese and Western doctors. After taking this agent, it can cultivate ovarian function, enhance metabolism, and regulate menstruation within a day, making all leukorrhea insensitive and eliminating palace cold and other symptoms like burning a rhino horn to illuminate monsters, driving them away in an instant, and restoring the health and beauty that women should have in a short period of time, and making the breasts stand tall and moving.</p>

<p>我的白濁為何不愈？</p>
<p>Why Does My Leukorrhea Not Heal?</p>
<p>余於白濁的臨床上，已有十餘年之經驗，治療之人，何止千萬，而許多淋病患者，往往請余治療時，必詢余『我的白濁，何以不愈』，因為許多患者，經過長時期之痛苦，多方面之醫治，（包括內服藥，電療，打针，手術）總難望其根治。往往由失望而灰心，由灰心而放縱，結果，本來可以根治之老白濁，反而成為不能治之痼疾矣!豈非陷病人於萬劫不復之境？是不可不速行補救，使其早日恢復康健之途。茲試言其故：原來一班失治之淋病，約有三因，一為誤服市上劣藥，二為誤被庸陋而設備不完之醫家之誤治（亦包括誤用手術，及打針，服藥，電療等）。第三為病家不知攝生，一味肆行無忌。皆為使淋病久洽不愈，或者可說愈治而淋病愈頑固也。</p>
<p>I have more than ten years of experience in the clinic of leukorrhea, and I have treated no less than tens of thousands of people. Many gonorrhea patients often ask me when asking me for treatment, "Why doesn't my leukorrhea heal?" Because many patients have undergone long-term suffering and various treatments (including internal medicine, electrotherapy, injections, and surgery), it is always difficult to hope for a radical cure. Often from disappointment to discouragement, from discouragement to indulgence, as a result, the old leukorrhea that could have been cured has become an incurable disease! Isn't this putting the patient in a state of eternal ruin? It is imperative to take remedial action as soon as possible so that they can return to the path of health as soon as possible. Now try to say the reason: Originally, there are about three reasons for a group of gonorrhea that is not cured: one is mistakenly taking inferior medicines on the market, and the second is being wrongly treated by mediocre doctors with incomplete equipment (including misuse of surgery, injections, medicine, electrotherapy, etc.). The third is that the patient does not know how to maintain health and recklessly indulges himself. All of these cause gonorrhea to be incurable for a long time, or it can be said that the more treatment, the more stubborn the gonorrhea becomes.</p>
<p>由此言之，要求老白濁治愈，必先具有補救上述三種原因。由精密的科學方法診斷，如尿道鏡，膀胱鏡，顯微鏡等，為之檢察病情，然後用德國樂根納博士所發明之濾淋平流電療法，或行局部之放射電流，或用電管插入尿道，使所有深部或局部之淋菌，完全撲滅。並濾清其毒素（按一般電療，僅有少許殺菌作用，絕對無濾清淋毒作用，讀者宜注意！）更佐以希氏血清，電氣按摩，台維氏新式菩齊，特製自家菌苗等，隨症治療，則不僅頑固之慢性淋可治，舉凡急慢性淋中之前後尿道炎，攝護腺炎，睾丸炎，精囊炎，關節炎等，均可應手取效。</p>
<p>From this, it can be said that in order to cure old leukorrhea, you must first have remedies for the above three reasons. Diagnose with precise scientific methods, such as ureteroscopy, cystoscopy, and microscopy, to examine the condition, and then use the "Lulin Parallel Flow Electrotherapy" invented by Dr. Legener of Germany, or perform local radiation current, or insert an electric tube into the urethra to completely eliminate all deep or local gonococci. And filter out its toxins (note that general electrotherapy only has a slight bactericidal effect, and there is absolutely no effect of filtering out gonococcal toxins, readers should pay attention!) Assisted by His serum, electrical massage, David's new-style "Pu Qi", and specially made homemade bacterial vaccines, etc., treat according to the symptoms, then not only stubborn chronic gonorrhea can be cured, but also acute and chronic anterior and posterior urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, arthritis, etc., can all be effective.</p>

<p>Refugee Zhang Boyuan's Death from Beating: Police Lawyer's Indignant Prosecution: Stealing in the Name of Charity, Engaging in Corruption and Favoritism, No Different Than Cannibalism: Shen Zhiguang and Others Should Be Severely Punished with the Maximum Penalty</p>
<p>Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association, Pudong Building Branch, located at the No. 42 Refugee Camp in Xuhui, Fahuazhen: The director and staff members, Shen Zhiguang, Song Meixi, Cao Linsen, Cai Zuying, and Zhao Weiyun, were accused of inflating the number of refugees and embezzling refugee food. When refugee Zhang Boyuan and others reported the matter to the branch, Shen and the others, upon learning of this, subjected Zhang to private torture, causing him to be covered in injuries. Unable to endure the abuse, Zhang escaped over the wall at night. Due to the darkness, uneven road, and cold weather, and Zhang's old age, he could not endure it and collapsed and died on the road. This incident took some time to come to light before Chief Inspector Liu Shaokui and Detective Song Bingzheng of the Public Concession Police Department learned of it, arrested Shen and others, and sent them to the First Special Court. After several hearings, a suspicious incident of changing coffins and corpses occurred. The Special Court then applied to the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court for designated jurisdiction due to jurisdictional issues. The Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court has now designated the First Special Court to have jurisdiction. Therefore, yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide, accompanied by Clerk Ding Chongnan, continued the hearing in Criminal Court One. According to Detective Song's report, the investigation revealed that the defendants often inflated the number of refugees, and when representatives from the branch came to investigate, they used non-refugees to deceive the upper-level personnel. Subsequently, after a representative from the branch, Mr. Xie, presented the reports from the No. 42 Refugee Camp for November and December of last year, the court ordered the start of arguments. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, then prosecuted, stating that the case involved two parts: embezzlement of publicly held property and causing death by injury. He pointed out that the establishment of refugee camps by charitable organizations was inherently good, providing a place for helpless and starving refugees to live. However, the defendants engaged in corruption in this undertaking, which was no different from eating the flesh and blood of refugees. This kind of behavior, is it not cannibalism? Not only that, but it also chills the hearts of philanthropists who are happy to do good. Therefore, if the defendants are not severely punished, no one will be willing to do charitable work. Regarding the charge of causing death by injury, Zhang Boyuan, to preserve his life, risked leaving his hometown and came to Shanghai, entering the refugee camp to live a hard life. However, upon seeing the darkness of the officials, he angrily reported the matter and was subjected to unbearable abuse, resulting in his death. The prosecution would rather Zhang Boyuan die under the fire of weapons than die at the hands of charitable organization staff members through abuse. Because the current death is enough to affect the public's desire to do good. In short, the behavior of the defendants not only treats human life as child's play but also affects the hearts of the people in society. The court should impose the maximum penalty in addition to imposing a heavier sentence to maintain discipline and deter future offenders. During the prosecution, Lawyer Ru's indignant state aroused sympathy from the audience. After the defendant's lawyer's defense, the court announced the conclusion and scheduled sentencing. The defendants were all returned to custody.</p>

<p>Shenchang Foreign Firm Sues Brick and Ash Company for Receiving and Selling Stolen Mud: Trial Concludes: Defendant's Lawyer Actually Calls It "Spoils of War"</p>
<p>The Longhua Shanghai Cement Factory, managed by the German firm Shenchang Foreign Firm, was forcibly occupied by the Japanese. All the inventory was then transported and sold. Later, the raw materials and materials stored in the factory were used to start production without permission. The cement produced was still sold in the market under the name of the domestic Elephant brand. Fearing that the outside world would be deceived, Shenchang Foreign Firm published statements in Chinese and foreign newspapers to clarify the facts and warned all sectors not to purchase the stolen goods. Later, it was discovered that ten brick and ash companies, including Yantai, Huiyuan, Xiangtailai,</p>
<h3>Following Guidance from the Rice Industry Market, Approximately Five to Six Thousand Bags of Rice are Transported to Shanghai Daily; the Japanese Puppets Plan to Levy Heavy Taxes but Cancel After Vigorous Efforts</h3>
<p>Shanghai's rice prices, after the market's best efforts to suppress them, have gradually stabilized. Merchants from various regions have successively resumed their transport operations, with approximately five to six thousand bags of rice arriving in Shanghai daily via land and water routes. The Japanese puppet regime planned to increase rice taxes, but after protests from mainland rice merchants, the plan was not implemented. A reporter from the Modern News Agency has investigated and reported the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Merchants from Various Regions Resume Transport Operations</p>
<p>The rice industry market, in accordance with the resolutions of the Soy and Rice Trade Association, strictly enforced price limits and suppressed hoarding by large households and manipulation by merchants. Market prices have returned to normal. Merchants from Changshu, Wuxi, Kunshan, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Zhangyan, Tongli, Bachi, and other regions, after earnest persuasion by the Market Management Committee, have successively resumed transport operations. At the same time, Shanghai rice merchants are also sending personnel directly to the producing areas to handle transport procedures for rice purchased from the mainland.</p>
<p>Rice Transport to Shanghai Gradually Increases</p>
<p>According to an investigation by a Modern News Agency reporter among rice transport merchant groups in this city yesterday, approximately five to six thousand bags of rice are being transported to Shanghai from the mainland daily. Most of these are transported by train, while the number transported by Yangtze River freighters and inland river boats directly to Shanghai is very small. It is reported that most of this rice was pre-purchased by Shanghai rice merchants before the end of the lunar year. Transport has been difficult in recent days due to cloudy and rainy weather, but the supply from the mainland should increase when the weather clears.</p>
<p>Japanese Puppet Tax Increase Vigorously Opposed and Canceled</p>
<p>The Japanese puppet regime, in order to plunder the economy, has concocted various pretexts to increase various exorbitant taxes and levies, especially on rice, increasing the "landing tax" by five jiao per shi (unit of dry measure). It was originally planned to be implemented on March 1st, but after mainland rice merchants, considering the impact on people's food, jointly protested to the Japanese puppet "organs," it has been canceled. As for the "removal tax" and "import tax" illegally implemented by the Japanese puppets, they are still being collected as usual.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Repeatedly Capture Guns and Weapons from Bandits; Zhang Miaogen's Whereabouts Unknown; Japanese Sentries Retreat Every Night</h3>
<p>In the Pudong South District and the area along the Shangnan Railway Line, because the guerrillas are preparing to engage in a sweeping operation against the Japanese bandits, they are dispatched every night to investigate the bandits' whereabouts. In the past few days, there have been occasional contacts, and several batches of guns and weapons have been seized from the bandits. Fearing that the guerrillas would penetrate deep into their security zone, the Japanese are extremely panicked. In addition to completely withdrawing sentries from various locations at night and concentrating their defense in one place, they have intensified their strict searches of pedestrians on various main roads during the day. According to rumors, Zhang Miaogen, the company commander of the guerrilla detachment in the Beicai area, has fallen into the hands of the bandits and his whereabouts are unknown, but it is not certain.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters Stipulates Methods for Commemorating Sun Yat-sen's Death Anniversary; Flags at Half-Mast, Silence, Suspension of Entertainment, Commemorative Meetings; Anti-War Propaganda Week Begins on the 12th</h3>

<p>(8) Whether they are teachers or students, the education community should not only work hard in various anti-enemy and national salvation tasks but should also solicit at least ten people per week to devote themselves to the Anti-War effort.</p>
<p>C. The chairmen of various groups, the directors of various factories, the principals of various schools, the heads of various families, etc., should promptly announce to the public or friends the efforts of their personnel to resist the enemy, encourage each other, and supervise them, and detailed propaganda plans will be stipulated separately.</p>
<h3>More Than Three Thousand Bags of Cotton from Eastern Zhejiang are Transported to Shanghai; For Use by Chinese Cotton Mills</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance recently issued an order to re-prohibit the transport of stored cotton from Eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai. Those who have already been issued certificates by the Chamber of Commerce are still allowed to transport. Currently, cotton mills in the concessions of this city, such as Qinfeng, Xinyu, Xinhe, Xieji, Tongyi, and Hongzhang, have shipped 3,855 bales of cotton to Shanghai in two batches, with certificates from the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, for their own use.</p>
<p>The Kangshayi freighter of the Italian-Chinese Company of Italy has now been approved by the Commander-in-Chief of the Tenth Army Group to load cotton in Ningbo and sail to Shanghai, limited to three times. It is reported that the transport company has completed the registration procedures and will soon sail the Shanghai-Ningbo line in compliance with the order.</p>
<h3>The Four Banks' Call Loans Amount to Approximately 15 Million Yuan by the End of February; A Decrease of One Million Yuan Compared to January</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Four Banks' Call Loan Commission, in order to regulate finance and support industry and commerce, has achieved considerable success since handling call loans. The loan balance in February was approximately 16 million yuan in national currency, of which 4.1% was transferred by the Bank Industry Joint Reserve Association and 3.7% was transferred by the Money Industry Joint Reserve Treasury. The loan balance in February was approximately 15 million yuan in national currency, of which 3.6% was transferred by the Bank Industry Joint Reserve Association and 3.9% was transferred by the Money Industry Joint Reserve Treasury. The end of last month was after the major closure of various industries, so the balance was greatly reduced, reaching as much as one million yuan.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Implements Street Searches of Women; Female Inspectors Performed Their Duties Yesterday; The Purpose is to Prevent Concealment of Weapons</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that yesterday (the 8th), according to senior officials of the Public Concession Police Department, female inspectors will join patrol teams to conduct inspections in the Central and Western Districts from today. It is reported that 24 female inspectors have already carried out their duties yesterday. This move indicates another step in the Concession's efforts to deal with terrorists and armed criminals. Twelve female inspectors have been active in the Western District since early morning, and searches are particularly strict in the area of Difeng Road, Great Western Road, and Yuyuan Road. Another twelve in the Central District are working with patrol teams on the Bund, inspecting women landing from ships and ferries. They also board trams and buses to carry out inspections. Street searches of women are rare in Shanghai. In the past, female suspects were always searched after being taken to the nearest police station. However, given that women often carry weapons and other military equipment belonging to criminals, a street search system has been established. This is part of the Public Concession's efforts to combat terrorists. Japanese naval soldiers often inspect Chinese entering Hongkou across the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, and men and women are searched. However, the Public Concession's position is slightly different, so the Municipal Council has decided to send female inspectors to the police stations to go out for inspections with street search teams for better results. The results of this new method have not yet been officially revealed yesterday, but even if weapons and other items have not yet been accurately seized, the fact that they will be inspected by patrol officers accompanied by White Russian merchant groups and will often go to various hotels and districts for searches will prove to be an important factor in the current movement.</p>
<h3>The New Sound Japanese Army in Pudong Suffers Another Major Loss; Guerrillas Once Broke Through the Outskirts; The Japanese Army Actually Tore Down Bridges and Held On</h3>
<p>Xinchang Town in Pudong is now the battlefield between the guerrillas and the Japanese army. They have held each other for more than twenty days, and the Japanese army has been defeated five times. The two sides are facing each other across the Erzao Port. Last night (the 7th), at about 10 p.m., the guerrillas launched a fierce assault on the Japanese army, and the Japanese army was defeated. The guerrillas broke through the Japanese army's outer defense line, and the Japanese army, based in the Wangjia Garden Command Headquarters, overflowed with small steel cannons and heavy machine guns, firing more than a thousand rounds to prevent the Chinese army from advancing. However, the Chinese army commanders braved the gunfire and advanced. The Japanese army was in a hurry and completely blew up the Dahe Bridge in Xinchang, so the guerrillas were blocked on the east bank of the river and then lured the Japanese army across the river, consuming a large amount of ammunition. By 5 a.m. on the 8th, after seven hours of shooting, the Japanese army lost more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. In this battle, more than ten Japanese soldiers were annihilated.</p>
<h3>Frugality to Save Lives, Important Suggestions, Requesting Readers to Do it Conscientiously</h3>
<p>The Frugality to Save Lives Committee recently issued 70 suggestions for frugality to save lives and important announcements as follows. We sincerely ask you, no matter how busy you are, to read these "70 Suggestions for Frugality to Save Lives" and do the feasible ones conscientiously. Use the money saved to help the pitiful refugees. Make fewer phone calls, save a little tap water, reduce the wattage of some lights, and save on any aspect of harmony. It doesn't matter how much money you have (it would be better if you have more), as long as you have perseverance, from the 1st to the 5th of each month, send the money you saved last month to the major banks under the name of a certain account by phone, and pay it into the savings and relief funds, and get a receipt. If you can save one yuan each month, you have already saved a refugee's life for half a month. By doing this kind of work, you will surely feel at peace and have immeasurable blessings.</p>
<p>Fundraising and Charity Sale Proceed Simultaneously; The Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group recently received a letter from the Knitting Industry Association stating that the industry recently held a meeting to discuss fundraising for refugee relief expenses. It was decided that all knitting industry workers would donate two corners per person to help the disaster. After collection, they will report to the Association. This move is very meaningful. If all workers in the city can fully implement it, the number will be considerable. Before wealthy merchants, intellectuals, and freelance professionals have widely promoted disaster relief, the industry's workers were able to generously donate. It is really not easy, so it has been decided to hold a charity sale, which all sectors have praised and expect to be very effective. The Chinese Professional Women's Club of this city recently sent a letter to the Association, expressing its willingness to participate in this work to fulfill its national responsibilities. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00, Ms. Wu Meiji Ruobing, as a representative, went to the Association to discuss the promotion of the charity sale. Director Ma Shaoquan and General Secretary Sun Mingqi received them and exchanged many views on promoting the charity sale.</p>
<p>Performing Arts and Broadcasting Staff Elected; The Performing Arts and Broadcasting Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Civic Group held its first standing committee meeting yesterday at noon.
