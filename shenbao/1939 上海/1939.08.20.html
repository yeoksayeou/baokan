<h3>苦悶中的出路</h3>
<p>近日上海市民多少總感到一點苦悶。苦悶的原因不外兩端：一是生活的壓迫；又一是環境的威脅。</p>
<p>生活的壓迫不自目前為始，但目前却特別地加速而且加緊起來。從食糧，燃料，布匹，以至一切日用細品，一二月內莫不增加了倍數以上的價格。靠薪給為生的人，固然沒有一個不仰屋興嗟；就是經營工商企業的人，也莫不因為自身成本的增加，以及，一般購買力的縮减，感到難乎為繼。至於一般勞苦大衆，以及成千成萬的失業者，難民羣，他們生活的慘苦，當然更無可形容。這種情形演進下去，孤島社會上必然潛伏着極大的危機，這是誰都感覺得到的。</p>
<p>然而生活的壓迫，還是顯然而容易體認的；至於環境的威脅，迹象在若潛若顯之間，但是內容的嚴重性却決不亞於前者。最近盛傳日方對上海又有新企圖。所謂新企圖，或許就是像天津那樣的「封鎖」。雖有日方發言人在本月十六日發出了否認封鎖的聲明，說什麼「封鎖為可能的，但未必有此事」；然而觀於上海日文報紙最近迭發激烈言論，鼓吹接收特區法院，主張沒收華商銀行，以及抨擊孤軍給養事件等等，可知日方的意旨所在，不無蛛絲馬跡可尋。再看上海日軍當局最近發表統制蔬菜的辦法，規定浦束蔬菜到滬，必須先經虹口，這件事雖未能按期實行，但也未曾聲明作罷。還有上海米價的突漲，雖說由於囤戶操縱；但據鄉人到滬的稱述，莫不謂因為種種的限制，所以四鄉的米糧不能到滬。這種事實可以表示是一種封鎖的預兆，或許說得嚴重一點，這就是一種無形的封鎖，或慢性的封鎖，再看八一三那天，虹口，滬西以及四郊各處，都有反英的示威遊行，並公然在天空散發反蔣反英的傳單；而且歹土一角，最近暴徒橫行，甚至凶刃所指，竟殺害了一位無辜的丹麥人克洛，據西報的紀載，說這也是歹土暴徒的工作之一，以冀威嚇上海的一般外人者。就種種情形看來，環境的威脅，的確也像生活的壓迫一般，目前正在日見加緊。總之，天津問題，英國張伯倫雖然節節退讓，却並不能滿足日閥的貪慾，那麼日閥想再進一步求償於上海，雖非必然，却很可能。何况日方在華軍事既無法續進，最近屢傳改變新戰略，其中根本剷除遠東國際勢力一項，就是所謂新戰略內容之一；那麼目前的急於解決上海問題，企圖摧毀遠東國際勢力的最後堡壘，當然也就是日方戰略運用的一端了。這足徵上海市民對於環境威脅的認識，不能算是一種過慮。</p>
<p>有了苦悶，必須尋求出路。徘徊彷徨，不是出路；自殺屈服，也都不是出路。出路是具體的，因各人的需要和各人的能力而不同的；但在覓得出路以前，却有一個共通的原則，那就是心理的鎮定。鎭定不是俯首聽命，也不是延頸待戮，而是運用冷靜的頭腦，憑理智來分析當前的局勢，再根據主觀客觀的條件，選擇自己的出路。</p>
<p>生活的壓迫和環境的威脅，表面上雖截然兩事，實際的出路却是一致的。因為由黑滙暴縮而促起了物價的高漲，由來源限制而造成了商品的缺乏，事件的性質雖是經濟的，而造成事件的原因却是政治的。所以生活壓迫狀態的進展或解除，必然跟着環境威脅狀况如何而轉移，而所謂苦悶出路的關鍵，也惟在環境一端。論上海環境的形勢，固然有成為天津第二的可能，但在目前却還未必立刻會實現。因為上海究竟是遠東國際勢力的最後堡壘，也就是日方進攻在華國際勢力的最後陣綫，而且不像天津英租界，僅與英國一國有關。如果一經發動，牽涉必多，恐將不可收拾，加以結果是禍是福，在日方也毫無把握；所以日方對於上海雖然圖之益亟，却未敢操之過切。然而雖不必操之過切，却又何妨用緩進的手段，來逐漸呑噬？所以無論上海是吾會被封鎖，會成為天津第二，這不過是形式的問題；至於從實質上說，上海環境的惡劣必然會日甚一日的。</p>
<p>無論上海最近的情勢怎樣發展，但澈底掃除環境的惡氛，必然在中國抗戰最後勝利的一天，這在事實上無可僥倖的。目前上海巿民因為不勝苦悶的緣故，或許有一部份要離開上海。離開上海而往內地去，這當然是最好的出路，但在目前決不是普遍易行的事。其决，從淪陷區裏避難來滬的人，或許想回到故鄉去；但是回到鄉村與日偽絕緣的地方固然很好；如果回到各淪陷城市裏去，那麼無異為日偽作點綴品，而且根本上也正是日偽所求之不得的事，現在何必去成全他們呢？至於無法離開而留居孤島的人，目前如何打破苦悶，那末祗有服膺蔣總裁最近吿上海同胞的箴言，就是建立堅固的精神堡壘。上海市民應記着：祗有抗戰最後勝利的一天，才是上海市民眞正解除痛苦的一天，所以目前的任務，也祗有同心一德，把四百多萬市民的意志築成一條堅固的長城，一方面不斷地向環境奮鬥，一方面却運用所有的力量擁護政府，促進勝利的早日到臨。</p>
<h3>東京談判實際決裂　日將加緊封銷津租界　英日代表昨日會談不歡而散　日軍部決令津日軍相機應付　英對經濟問題意見通知美國</h3>
<p>東京　英政府決定純在英日基礎上進行日方所提出之幣制與存銀事件、不能產生有益的結果後、英日談判現乃遭遇嚴重危局、蓋英政府此種決定與日本意見直接相反也、日方以為經濟與政治問題必須視為議程中整個部份、談判而解決之、英大使克萊琪將英政府之決定通知日方代表後、日相平沼即取銷其星期杪出外休憇之程序、觀此亦可見因英政府此項決定而起的局勢之嚴重、今晨陸軍省行政人員開會後、外陸兩省復舉行聯席會議、大的外相有田與陸相板垣將於今日午後往見首相平沼以決定政府對於英日會議之態度、日方觀察家認英政府之決定希圖（一）單獨成立天津警務之協定而使東京談話無期擱置、（二）將經濟問題允其是禁止中國法幣流通事、提交有關係的各國之國際會議、（三）與法美兩國成立共同陣綫、在東亞新秩序之建立上加以經濟壓力而保障其自己在遠東之利益、據日方覜察家之意見、英國對於日本經濟力估計過低、致有此種希圖、日本絕對不能接受英方決定、同時日本各報幾一致要求日政府立即停止英日談判、日日新聞稱、東京談判成功受益者英國、至於日本則此談判之成敗、實無多大關係、蓋華北現已入於日本掌握中、日本一且宜布以其所有實力保障其利益之決心、則英國接受日本之宜布與吾、固無以異也、日政府此時宜中止東京談判、以免一再延會、致為英國所侮弄、况談話失敗後之受害者為英國而非日本乎云、都新聞指英國拖宕政策起因有二、（一）信任但澤問題、必可和平解決、（二）欲竚視日本對於歐洲新局勢將採何種政策、日本此時宜促請英國在限定時期中重開會議、以防英國於但澤問題有結果及日本對歐政策有決定後改變其態度而破壞此會議、如英國不從此請、則英日會議破裂所有後果之責任全由英方負之、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　陸軍省行政人員今晨召開緊要會議後、聞已決定將天津問題如何解决事、聽天津日軍當局自行酌量辦理之、蓋認犬津事件之談判、在實際上業已決裂也、據陸軍省之意見、束京談話係因英方請求舉行者、其目的在謀取天津爭執之解決、日方早巳聲明天津問題、唯英國放棄援蔣政策、始可解決、今英方乃提議不討論經濟問題、而欲擱置東京談話、此非談判破裂而何、（十九日路透）</p>
<p>東京　陸軍當局十九日午前召開省部聯台首腦部會議、鄭重協議日英會談之今後方策、結果決定根據旣定方針、以如左態度邁進、（一）日英東京會談係以解決天津租界之封鎖問題為目的、順應英方要求而舉行者、為達成此目的起見、由於確保現地軍治安之必要、則英方拋棄援蔣態度、並解決租界之治安經濟問題實為絕對必要之條件、（二）在此次會談中、英國在大體上雖經根據日方要求、承認一般原則問題及治安問題、然對於經濟問題之討論、則不斷延期、使會議陷於中絕狀態、故東京會談、事實上不啻已決裂、今後交涉除移諸現地交涉外、別無他法、（三）日方現地軍當局曾再三聲明、即欲謀租界方面治安之確立、則治安與經濟問題之關係、密切不可分離、如欲加以分離、日方斷難承認、（四）故英方如幡然悔悟、向日方表示誠意之塲合、但因會議已終於不成功、故今後措置、惟有一任現地軍當局自由從事、其結果則租界封鎖將愈强化、蓋為當然之事耳、（十九日同盟）倫敦英國政府對日公然表示、中國白銀與代幣問題、非有九國公的其他簽字國家之參預、英國不願單獨討論、問時對華繼續放款三百萬鎊、時事觀察家認為英國在遠東方面巳有放棄綏靖政策之決心、對於日本、不凖備再作何等之讓步、此與英日訂立初步協定時、及表示願將叫華人嫌疑犯交出時、巳有顯著不同、英國對日態度轉硬之原因、　圖與美國遠東政策、表示密切之聯繫、蓋美國對於美日商的、既巳宣吿廢止、同時於英國在東京方面再度屈服之時、更向中國購買大批白銀、再則為袪除蘇聯對於英國之懷疑、促使三國軍事同盟早日成立計、英國對日亦非採取强硬態度不可、蓋蘇聯對於英日談判、多有認其為又一綏靖政策也、據此間某高級官員言、英日關係漸由陰　密佈進入暴風雨之階段、此間日人方面稱、日本對於英方主張以九國公的會議解決貨幣與法幣流通問題、日本方面決計予以拒絕、（十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　非英籍外交界昨晚預言、自英國拒絕與日本單獨討論幣制及白銀問題後、英日兩國在東京舉行之談判、即將決裂、此間日方人士相信、英國政府之決定、將加强日本軍閥之地位、並使日本與義德軍事同盟、更接近一步、是乃日本軍部之目標也、消息靈通方面人士聲稱、英國決定拒不與日方談判華北白銀及幣制問題、由英國政府單獨定奪、雖然、英國會考慮有關係各國之意見、包括美法等國、英國幷將新決定通吿美法與中國、英國政府昨日致新訓令於英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士時囑　立即通吿日本政府謂、『英日兩國單獨繼續談判白銀及幣制問題、無從獲得有益結果、』新訓令幷暗示英國贊成重召一九三七年白魯塞爾會議、（耶九國公的簽字國會議）、英國致日方牒文中指示、英國雖承認白銀及幣制問題、然不能於九國公的及其他有關係條的之簽字國對中國現狀作任何最後討論時、竟置身於事外、對各關係列强、須予以發表彼等關於該項問題主張之機會、英國政府發言人在此間聲稱、英國駐日大使通知日本代表團領袖加藤、「倘經濟問題須繼續討論時、雙方必須凖備考慮有關係列强之意見、」發言人解釋對於維持天津秩序協定談判、頗有進境、渠信該協定有分別簽訂之可能、然渠坦白疑慮日方是否對此同意、東京方面消息、證實發言人之信念、（十九日美聯電）</p>

<p>倫敦　關於東京談判、英國政府拒不討論貨幣問題之後、每日快報頃發表社評、對於此種堅决態度、表示欣幸、略謂「英國政府拒不與日本討論有關全中國之經濟問題、實屬正辦、關於此層、雖在東京英國大使館之四周、有反英運動者高呼威脅口號、英國決不為其所動、時至此日、英國政府、允宜代表人民、昭吿日本云、日本乘吾人之危、以壓迫相加、已在英國引起仇視心理、且必永在記憶之中、而非短時期內所能消釋、一俟現行局勢澄淸之後、世界時局發生新問題之時、日本恐將噬　莫及」云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>軍事外交雙管齊下　德圖控制中東歐　波蘭邊境集結重兵　積極推進包圍政策　羅國人心惴惴不安</h3>
<p>巴黎　法外交部昨晚繼續接到德軍向波蘭邊境集中之報吿、德軍繼續運往東普魯士戈尼斯堡、向波蘭西里亞邊境開發、此次之重兵開往西里亞、使德軍於西境與北境皆具有極大之威力、因德國早已有重兵駐於西境也、（十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　「新聞記事報」駐華沙訪員頃來電稱、德國陸軍一萬五千員名、原多駐在巴伐里亞省、現已調往斯洛伐克邦集中、其中一部份幷在波蘭邊境附近駐防、且有鐵絲網七十餘火車、運往該處、斯洛伐克邦當局亦已奉令加速完成各軍用公路之通至波蘭國邊境者、此外、原駐該邦與德國邊境之奧地利省軍隊、因與斯洛伐克居民曁保護地波西米亞省捷克族人相友等之故、經當局認爲「不其可靠、」業已將其撤退、而以德國本埠開來之軍隊塡防、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　據此間消息、德國與斯洛伐克八月十七日所簽訂之新軍事條約、並不含有德國將增加在斯洛伐克之駐軍力量、或擴充其在斯洛伐克之軍事活動、該約僅出席劃定若干區域內軍事地帶之界限、並修正以前條約所引起地理上不適當之情形、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　關於英法報章所傳、德國巳與斯洛伐克締結軍事協定之說、此間權威人士頃鄭重加以吾認、略謂、德國軍隊所駐地點、均在本年三月間德斯協定所劃定之界限內、斯洛伐克首都勃萊斯堡並無德軍蹤跡、但德國派往斯洛伐克之軍事代表團、今已改為軍事顧問團、與駐在軍隊保持接觸云、（十九日海通社電）</p>

<p>偽警探等　侵入租界</p>
<p>待至六時相近、警備車與探捕等巳折入極司非而路、將至忻康里附近、因瞥見有十餘偽警以及身穿便衣形似偽探員等、手持武器、在租界轄境極司非而路上大步踱來、捕房探捕、意為若輩不明限界、乃即停車、上前曉諭、並勸若輩退出</p>
<p>勸令退出　開槍反抗</p>
<p>詎知十餘人竟不理睬、甚且以所持武器揚威反抗、正相持間、警備車上西探長金祿克（Kin　Look）亦前來勸諭、奈仍不理、且有起與為難之勢、西探長乃反身擬以電話報吿捕房、不料若輩竟即首先開槍、向金氏射來、彈由背部而入、</p>
<p>雙方交戰　彈如雨點</p>
<p>但金氏勇氣百倍、雖受重傷、仍能屹立不倒、且亟指揮探捕等準備、但斯時偽警等槍彈已齊向警備車射來、密如連珠、因此警備車上所備機槍、亦隨之而發、頓時如入戰塲、</p>
<p>小隊英軍　馳往彈壓</p>
<p>該管靜安寺捕房因得金氏報告、急切撥派大批探捕馳往、而該區英防軍司令部亦經接獲肇事報吿、同時指派小隊英軍、前往彈壓、並將該極司非而路一帶立即阻止通行、</p>
<p>受傷探長　送院醫治</p>
<p>偽警等見事態擴大、且見其夥伴中巳有四名被捕擊倒、不免情慌、乃相率逃出界外、而金氏亦待大批探捕趕到後、始發覺受傷而倒地、當由探捕扶之登車、送往醫治、</p>
<p>偽警四人　兩死兩傷</p>
<p>該已擊倒偽警四名中兩名業已身死、兩名受傷、經訊問之下、證供一名倪連根、年四十一歲、彈中膝部、一名趙發淸、年四十四歲、彈中腹部及腿部、現在醫院先予救治中、</p>

<h3>金融　滙市徘徊　投機商又播流言　一般皆不以為信</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌揭曉、俱無上落、英美滙暗市、初時情勢殊平、九時三刻後、因日商銀行暨洋行界均前來扒給、兼西商沙遜亦力扒期貨、故為狀遂見步軟、一度英金最緊、曾喊過三辦士三七五、美匯最軟亦會呌過六元五六二五、嗣以西商沙遜突來回吐現貨英美匯、致狀況轉平、結果英微緊〇一五六二五、美略軟〇三一二五、八九月期貨、則均無榮辱、中途投機家又散佈謠言、謂下週一外匯將起劇烈變動之說、但一般經營者、均不以為信、且値英美積極援華聲中、再以歐局之不寗、故亦未敢遽邇加碼、是以暫懷觀望、致半天交易不多、</p>
<p>日商結進沙遜回出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期長〇六二五、遠期升一二五、紐的銀價漲一二五、倫敦生金仍平、匯兌英對美·對法均平、對滬昂〇六二五、美對英·對法俱平、對滬大五分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士四三七五、美匯六元六八七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後匯豐吸進同行現貨英金三辦士四三七五、時為狀極形呆滯、迨匯豐掛脾揭曉、悉無上落、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、依然免微、此後日商銀行與洋行界競相扒結、兼西商沙遜亦未購結期貨、故市勢步軟、計日行與洋行結進英行有利及某美行等現貨英金三辦士四〇六二五、及現貨美匯六元六二五、繼而沙遜扒進外行九月份英金三辦士及二辦士九六八七五、並同月份美匯五元八一二五及七五、後現貨英金曾喊過三辦士三七五、美匯亦呌過六元五六二五、十一時光景、西商沙遜突來吐予匯豐等外行現貨英金三辦士四〇六二五及四三七五、繼又塞予某行大通現貨美匯六元六二五及六八七五、故為狀回平、時已午刻、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士四二一八七五、美匯六元六五六二五、本月份英金三辦士三七五、美匯六元五六二五、九月份英金三辦士、美匯五元八一二五、結果比上日、現貨英微緊〇一五六二五、美略軟〇三一二二五、八九月期貨、英美匯則均無榮辱、午後週六無巿、</p>

<p>香港十九日電、今日匯市開盤平靜、英美日各匯仍吿不動、申匯降七元、為四百十八元、九時五十五分、申匯回升五元、為四百二十三元、至午收均無榮辱、下午週六無市、</p>

<p>金市風平浪靜</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、情勢與　日相同、盤旋於隔昨晚收價左右、初開因銀樓帮賣意殊濃、加以客帮與散戶等均無吃胃、致開市即退達四千五百二十五元、繼又步挫至四千五百二十元低盤、十時後聞外匯步軟、激動買風、津港兩帮紛託塲中之代理人競相吸購、兼某錢兌業及某銀號亦代客收買、故市價一度會漲達四千五百九十元高峯、十一時許聞外匯回平、賣風又起、某金號代投機商復來吐塞、致潛勢重趨下挫、延至午收軋跌五元、午後無正式行巿、但塲外亦鮮變動、價仍逗留於四千五百五六十元之間、半天交易的六百餘兩、銀樓飾金未見更改、海關金與中英純金等仍無伸縮、</p>
<p>烚赤僅小五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開人心不振、銀樓帮賣意允濃、且外滙殊平、致開巿於賣風籠罩下、即撳低三十五元、銀樓帮售予錢兌業二十兩、為四千五百二十五元、繼叉續降五元、銀樓帮互做三十兩、價四千五百二十元為當日低盤、九時三刻聞外匯步軟、致將買風激動、某銀樓與證券帮代客帮力進、兼某錢兌業亦代富商吸收、潛勢頓反動向上、不久即飛漲七十元、現金號互做十兩、價四千五百九十元為當日高峯、此後同業以賣買立塲、一度盤旋於四千五百七八十元之間、造就散戶搶帽子機會、十一時光景、聞外匯回平、賣者較湧、某金號代投機商等均來塞出、市勢步軟、錢兌業互做二十兩、價四千五百四十五元、將近午刻為狀稍回、余號互做二十兩、為四千五百五十五元、作午收價、結果比上日續跌五元、半天七十元上落、現金號之本牌金照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低六十五元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、均無更動、大同行仍懸原價四百六十元、新同行為四百五十八元、收進的减低十餘元至二十元不等、</p>
<p>純金呆而不動</p>
<p>十八日倫敦電、英純金仍呆定如故、每盎斯為七鎊八先令七辦士、致中央銀行之各行市價仍呆而不動、</p>
<h3>拆息掛低　貼現亦跌</h3>

<h3>黑滙安定　與上海貿易　—繫於入超之多寡—</h3>
<p>上海月份貿易入超、雖由六月份入超之四千二百零五萬六千元、降而為一千六百九十萬九千元、所减有二千五百十四萬七千元之鉅、不能謂非黑市外匯大縮之成功、然仍為上海而使中國外匯基金負担一千六百餘萬元之支出、未免太費、惟八月份起之上海入超額、可預測其將較七月份為少、因貿易所受黑匯暴縮之影響、必較七月份為鉅也、至於上海黑匯市價雖較前為穩定、但仍有此巨額入超、非至上海進出口貨額差堪平衡、或所差在數百萬元之譜、不易使之安定也、</p>
<h3>英美金票傳昂</h3>

<h3>上海生絲業的當前難長</h3>
<p>— 瞿揚</p>
<p>目前上海絲業，絲價較戰事初期高漲了五倍；出口數額，較戰後第一年增加了一倍；從事製絲的利潤，提高到百分之百；諸如此類盛况，誰說不是上海絲業的空前繁榮！然而為什麼絲業中人，上至廠主下至職工，却說這是絲業的末日呢？這個末日的降臨，怎樣會以繁榮的姿態來出現呢？難道眞是所謂物極必反嗎？同時對於這個末日的降臨，難道我們僅僅以束手待斃的方法來等待它嗎？當然不是的，所以現在的絲業中人，應該趁早來對現階段的絲業，作一决詳詳細細裹裏外外諸條件的思考，分析它的基本特徵，推測它可能受到的危機，並研究出如何應付的方法，俾使上海絲業能渡過難關，展開今後的康莊大道。這裏提出來的，不過是其中的一鱗半爪，筆者的動機，是希望藉此獲得業內業外人士，對本間題的注意和興趣，以促成本問題有更進一步的硏究，現在僅略抒管見，願就正於讀者</p>
<p>（一）戰後上海絲業，它的動向是畸形的，它的繁榮是病態的。</p>
<p>戰前後滬絲廠之統計</p>
<p>我們記得戰前上海開工的絲廠；計四十四家，繅絲車總數一萬〇八十六部。在戰事中毀於侵略毒燄的：計絲廠三十四家，繅絲車六千八百三十六部。倖存下來的，祗有絲廠十家，繅絲車二千五百六十二部。兩年來租界區如雨後春笋般爭先建立起來的新絲廠，到今日為止，再加上舊有倖存下來的，上海目前絲廠的總數計三十五家，繅絲車共計六千二百二十二部。以這樣短促的時間，恢復了上述的數字，戰後上海絲業復興的速度，應該說是値得讚許的，然而為什麽說它的動向是畸形的呢？</p>
<p>重建戰後的絲業成功</p>
<p>上海淪為孤島，它固有的經濟重心，應該即向內地搬移。因為成為孤島以後的上海，不論它還俱備着種咱特殊的複雜的條件，可以給我們運用，然而在它懷抱中所有的工商實業，除了有利於他的條件之外，誰也不能得到原料和成品上的種種自由和運輸。換言之，即戰後上海的一切工業，不動則已，一動即無法避免使自己成為他的間接或直接的經濟附庸。這就是淪陷後的上海工業，所以要必須內移的原因。然而，對於我們的上海絲業，是太疏忽了，並且不僅疏忽而已，而是進一步想在「甕」中重建自己的「事業」了。</p>
<p>在這種心理下，重與戰後絲業的運動，雖是風起雲湧，然而它的發展方向，也難免是投機式的，悲觀的，希圖僥倖於一時的。我們大概沒有忘記，在戰後絲業重振的初期，那句傳播人口，視為聰明之談的「絲廠祇有八個月壽命」，正是該種情緒的標本寫照，事實上，上海絲業也祗能在這個沒有出路的基礎上來茍延殘喘。</p>
<p>在殘喘初期帶來的繁榮，是日夜開工趕製生絲，在迅速成絲，迅速脫手，迅速獲利的原則下，雖然曾經置生絲之品質優劣於不顧，雖然忽略了去年度日本產絲量對於二〇—二二條紋的减少，沒有讓上海同等條紋的生絲，藉此機會而在較好的件下出售於國外市塲，但過去一年度的事實，生絲出口額竟提升到了三萬七千五百九十六擔，超過了戰後第一年的一倍幾乎回復了戰前出口額的水準，從事製絲的利潤，是超過了資數額的一倍或一倍以上，是達到了從未之有的景氣境地。</p>
<p>繼續這個繁榮而來的第二步現象是怎樣呢？是從投機的，悲觀的，希圖僥倖的心理，進而為冒險的，大膽的，以作孤注一擲的行動了。這在今年春繭收購的情形上，可以非常容易的尋出那一種更進一步的病態特徵。</p>
<p>上海絲業的病態發展</p>
<p>外滙變動始於去年八月，即一先令二便士貶低到八便士二五；第二次是本年六月初，再下降到六便士半；第三次是最近，曾經下落到三便士二五。在絲價上面，跟隨着外匯緊縮而上騰的是，白廠經XB二〇——二二條紋從前年一月每擔市價七六〇元，到同年八月漲到一二〇〇元。從今年六月到現在，絲價是自二〇〇〇元漲到了三八〇〇元。在第二决的外匯緊縮到現在，這正是收購春繭竣事，橫遭人家强力扣留，討價還價於「通行」問題的時候。</p>
<p>在本年六月初，據本報絲繭消息，內地春繭，由於交通不便（包括內地與內地，內地與上海）繭廠被「統制和被搗毀，形成了繭市集中，繭價大跌等等情形，滬杭綫春繭扯價跌至四十五元，如以這個繭本計算，連一應開銷在內，每担絲本僅為七〇〇元，如以當時市價拋售國外，則鮮繭趕製成絲，每擔生絲可獲利六〇〇元强，然而事實上呢，由於上海絲商鑒於利澗的高大，對於對方的勒索，表示得比較慷慨，於是對方也就得寸進尺貪心愈大，致春繭出運問題，也超出了斤斤於「捐和稅」的範圍，而來討論於沒收和放行的百分率了。</p>
<p>那麽上海生絲業是不是會再忍痛妥協呢？答覆是可能的因為上海絲業的妥協程度，是會跟隨着從事製絲的利潤高厚而提高，而加深的，這原因是無須加以說明。</p>

<h3>兒童的升學和就業問題</h3>
<p>金丁</p>
<p>在這個悠長的五十多天的暑假中，一般剛從小學裏畢業出來的兒童們，對於升學和就業的間題，－定是在小　　中盤旋不已的。預備升學的兒童，升入怎麼樣的學校呢？準備就業的兒童，究竟就什麼職業呢？這誠然是一個值得研究，值得考慮的間題。</p>
<p>我以爲預備升學的兒童，第一應該先要調查學校的內容，是否充實？教管是否嚴格？校風是否優良！收費是否合理？如果這幾點，大部份認爲滿意了。那末，便該亳無疑慮的報名投考；如果大部份認爲不滿意的話，便應該慎重考慮，選擇合乎標準的學校，這是個人對於升學在兒童們，所貢獻的一點意見。</p>
<p>至於準備就業的兒童們，你們應該知道：讀書是就業的準備，就業是讀書的實踐。爲了環境的驅使，不得繼續求學，是根本用不到什麼悲哀的。因爲就業以後，只要自己有決心，有毅力，隨時隨地仍有讀書研究的機會。不過在眼前，就什麼職業，才能合乎合己的個性，才能發展自己的長處，這是在就業之先，應該顧慮到的。照我看來，預備就業的兒童們，先要把自己的志　　長，公開的對家長，師友，親戚說明，希望他們在替你介紹職業的時候，有個依據。至於兒童自己，對終理想的聯業內容，也　先有一個研究，這樣，才不致踏進了這扇職業之鬥，感覺到無從下手的痛苦。每個就業的兒童，如果能夠這樣，那末，定能減職業故途許多無謂的損失。總而言之，兒童的升學和就業問題實在是值得研究，值得考慮的。兒童的家長，師友，親戚都該負起責任來，替這般一片天真毫無經驗的兒童，解決道個重要問題。上面所說的一番話，不過是提祟來供大家參考罷了。</p>
<h3>爲什麽</h3>
<p>— 王沛</p>
<p>爲什麼：爲什麼飛機能在空中行駛？爲什麼無棧電能傳佈聲音？爲什麼電燈能自動發光？爲什麼一天能有　夜？爲什麼鵝蛋經了孵化之後，會　出小雞？爲什麼樹木花草到了冬天，多數要枋謝？爲什麼這樣？爲什麼那樣？「爲什麼」是無窮的。只有「爲什麼」是有生氣的，是進展的，也只有「爲什麼能充實人生，改進社會，創造世界。</p>
<p>爲什麼壺水沸後，蒸汽能推動壺蓋而發肯蒸汽機？爲什麼電流的銅錢一斷，兩端會發用電花血發明白熱燈弧光燈？總之，不論任何大小的事情，只要經過了「爲什麼」三個字的實驗後，總有一僩新奇的創造，世界當然也隨著「爲什磨」而進步啦！</p>
<p>胡適先生在新生活篇中也有道樣一段意思：「一個人的生活，若經過了「爲什麼的體驗以後，這生活才有意思，有意思的生活，就呌做新生活」。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們願意過新生活嗎？那就別忘了「爲什麼」啊！</p>
<h3>棄舟登車</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>明兒避　記之三十—</p>
<p>船艙裏的逃　人，到得他捫吃好了晚飯，艙裏的空氣頓時緊張了。三家的主婦都在包紮吃飯的器具，整理手　的用品，因爲這是在江山船裏度那最後的一晚，他們都閉著眼，養神，沒有一個好好熟睡的。</p>
<p>「你們不要睡熟了。我們一等到天色將亮，便有好多的工作要幹，什麼打鋪蓋哪，吃早飯哪，搬行李哪，而且我們要越早到汽車站越好，所以要工作得快而細，因爲我們打聽得汽車是不一定開的，有時湊得巧，便開一班有的人竟在車站附近的旅館裏等了好多天，還沒有搭上車，我們到那時要靠我們的運氣了。」張先生喃喃不　的說說著。</p>
<p>「爲什麼不開呢」？一這因爲在抗戰時期，在工業落後的我另，軍事方面的設備當然是不夠，汽車是其中之一，便以民用汽車來補充，於是民用汽車極感缺乏，不得不停駛了。張先生回答了這話，把各人的工作分配好了。</p>
<p>一鉛的逃難人都待著東方發白，他們在江山船已等待了整整的十七天了。在天色未明時張李兩先生便跳上了岸去接洽汽車的事，留下明兒父親來主持船上的一切事。到得雞聲一響，船上的人們顯得格外的忙碌。明兒母親擼著年幼的弟妹，從狹狹的跳板踏上了岸灘邊，其他的女眷也都隨清走上了岸，明兒的哥哥在艙裏監視船夫們搬行李，明兒在岸上依著行李單人在點數行李的件數，一面把三家的行李分別的　船夫堆在一起，這一陳子的紛亂足足忙了半小時左右，最後山明兒父親一一檢點，再回到船上向創裏巡視了一番，－些兒也沒有遺落，便把船錢付給船老大，那知他真不爽快，常初杭州下船約時候，言明船錢和一切酒錢都包括在內，到了送時，他便要討什麼酒錢，柴火錢，經過了好一番的口舌，仍加了一些錢，這可見他們真是小人。</p>
<p>費了九九二虎之力，好容易的把一大幫逃難人和一大堆笨重的行李送到了汽車站。到了那裏，只見人山人海的人和行李擁滿了整個狹小的車站，真有水洩不通的　樣。</p>
<p>張先生喜沖沖的從人堆裏擠到明兒父親的那兒：很歡悅的說道：「我們的邇氣真不錯，今天有兩班汽車。那邊賣票處是擠得要命，那真是巧得意想不到，那賣票員是我的老同學，很不費力貿到了票子，不然要等上兩三天也說不定。你們的行李在那裏，　他們去搬，今天早上八時要開車的，不過，我們的人很多那賣票員　我們，分兩班去，比較好一些。」</p>
<p>明兒的父親聽得了這一番話，心中是說不出的快樂說道：「好極了，這是你的大功，我們要獎賞一下」。「不，老兄的功勞也不淺，這許多人和行李一齊到車站，不然，我買到了票也是沒有用的。這是我們分工合作的好處哩」。於給這一大批的逃難人分別的擠上了車，直向他們的目約地飛一般的駛去。</p>

<h3>金魚風鈴</h3>
<p>— 新生</p>
<p>小朋友，長長的暑假期快要完了，不久你就要上學校去念新書，這兒我告訴你怎樣做一具金蕉風鈴的小玩意，以作暑假期來的小手工，它的製法很是簡易，而且材料都是你們手頭有著的。</p>
<p>材斜：厚畫紙一張，青色緞一條（長十四　），豌豆兩粒，幾線（長四，五十　）水彩顏色，膠水。</p>
<p>製法：先參照附圖在厚的圖畫紙上畫1，2兩塊，1的寬爲四糎，長度自三十糎至四十糎，2共劃分爲兩條，每條寬一糎，長度較1略長：劃下後即施以彩色，12之色須不相同，如欲更美觀些則可改用色紙以代。用膠水先將1粘成圓圈，然後再把2的兩條分別牯貼在圓圈的兩面邊綠上。另用厚紙照附圖的3，4，6剪成金魚（紅，金，黃，黑，自，花均可）兩尾，綠色紙葉兩張，風鈴（黃色）三片；先將金魚依虛線對揩，再用膠水粘合，然後以絲線兩段將其懸　在圓紙圈上（如附圖）：再將三片風鈴揩彎，而亙相膠粘合一。以上諸件完成之後，即可將長線線一根貫穿圓紙圈約兩中端，使其可以懸掛，圓圈以上的線段中穿以綠葉兩片，每片葉子的下面，各穿嵌一粒青豌豆（5）這豆須先在水中浸漲，以便穿湧；有了豌豆，則兩片葉子，就不會相疊在一起了。圓圈以下的線段中，除了繫著紙風鈴之外，尾端更掛著一條淡青色的軟緞（7），軟緞的上面還可以寫著某某做的字樣。如無軟緞，可改用彩色絲線紮成的發頭。此外，若是在長線繫以小鈴兩隻，那末當微風吹來的時候：金魚舞踴，風鈴轉動，緞帶飄搖，再加那小鈴的清聲，真是有趣異常呢？</p>
<p>小朋友，你何不製幾具「金魚風鈴「掛在自己的畫室窗下或是走廊　下以做裝　呢？假若送給你的好朋友，他們一定也是非做歡迎的！</p>
<h3>金魚風鈴</h3>
<h3>畜生道中（十四)</h3>
<p>— 心青</p>
<p>他他們倆還是掉下去了，掉下去，不住的掉！那路似乎分外的長，分外的遠！這時夜已過去，早晨來了，太陽亮亮地照耀著，照是他們還是掉下去，掉下去，彭其口中不住的喊著「呀！呀！」勒夫也「汪汪汪」不住的　，它那頸圈上的鈴，也不住的作饗，直到後來拉到了河的上面，彭其大吃一驚，也來不及喊救，早與勒夫一同掉落到水中去了。勒夫是會游冰的，不多一會，已游上了岸，可是彭其却不會游泳，吸下了一口水，就沈對了以前他沈死狗類的所在。彭春窒息得透不過氣來，氣噓噓地喘著，一面划手划腳的在水中掙扎，正好像他以前沈死狗類時親眼所見的慘狀，那裏知道他竟親自表演起來，這真是意想不到的啊！他在水中不住的掙扎，窒息得更爲厲害，他的腦袋似乎要爆裂開來，然而又喊不出聲，因爲他的一張嘴已被那水堵塞住了。</p>
<p>彭其在水中掙扎著，兩隻手兀目在水面上亂抓，抓到了一件飄過的什麼東西，可是一些兒也沒有用，因爲這是一頭死狗的屍身，就是他昨夜拋在河中的。這一嚇，比了那冷水的刺激更爲厲害，他想自己也許要溺死在這裏，和他那些虐待而死的死躺死狗一同腐爛了。那時近邊一株樹上，有一頭自嘴　啞啞地喊道：「　得他好！罰得他好　河岸上有許多青蛙坐在那裏，望著那些畜頭的屍身，閣閣閣的狂　道：把石塊擲死他！把石塊擲死他！」</p>
<p>河面上有一尾梭魚，正在近旁游來游去，它對於彭其倒沒有什麼惡感，因爲它仗著彭其的殘忍，倒反享受了好幾頓的美餐。但這梭魚也像尋常的動物一樣地自私自利的，它正在等著一個機會，可以把彭其也吃下肚了去。</p>
<p>彭其－方面越是掙扎，一方面却越沈越下，過去的一切殘忍的回億，好像映電影似的，逐一的在他心上映過，而那滔滔不絕的流水，也不住的在他身上沖過去。他記得第一次弄死的一頭大蜜蜂，他又記得把－枝刺在誇克斯的鼻子裏，一切的一切，都像潮水般的湧上心來，似乎在清算他那殘酷的舊賬，使他良心上受到了無限的痛苦，不知不覺的把自己痛恨起來。</p>
<p>一會兒他忽從水中浮起來，浮到水面上吐了一口氣，瞧見了蔚藍色的天空，是多麼的美啊！耳中又聽得一頭秧雞在田中　著，那片田正是他的兩位小妹妹要他去採蓮香花的所在。一會兒他在迷迷糊糊中似乎瞧見諾克斯那個光滑可愛的頭也在水中浮沈，頓時猛吃一驚，心中自言自語道：「不不不！上帝在上，我並沒有殺死過它！」</p>
<p>於是他又沈下去了。他想起了自己的家，想起了自己的父親和母親，又想起了他常常作要的兩位小妹妹；他曾經怎樣的欺侮伊們，弄死伊們所心愛的動物，見伊們急得哭了，又怎樣的嘲笑伊們。他又記起去年仲夏的假期中，伊們怎樣的來歡迎他回到家裏來，帽子裏都裝滿了鮮花，並且把鮮花做了圈兒，套在驢子的兩隻長耳上；他又記起當時怎樣的把一根裝有鐵釘的木棒刺那驢子，刺得它亂跑亂跳，害得用位小妹妹驚啼起來，他自己却以爲是怪好頑的一回事！咦！他又想起來了，想起自己平日怎檬的躲開了這兩位天真爛漫的小妹妹，偏去和那沒有受過教育而無惡不作的小鐵匠合在一起，自己反覺得得意非常，接驚他雙記起自己夜夜安睡的那張很舒服的　鋪，他的母親夜夜總得在　鋪邊替他祝福；那裏知道自己此刻會沈在水中，和他先前弄死的貓狗作伴呢！</p>
<p>這當兒他又浮到水面上來了，　然的看見了諾克斯的頭，和他相去不到三尺；他還瞧見那一對清亮的棕色的眼睛，正很懇切的汪在他的臉上，他不由得心中一急，暗暗地想道：「我平日慣常虐待它，它也許來報復我吧」。然而他倒也不放在心上，因爲他的身心本已飽受了苦痛，也不怕再有什麼痛苦加到他身上來了。他只抬起了眼，打算對他生長的家，作一個最後的注目禮。正在這時，忽有一頸百靈烏飛越來，向空中飛去，而彭其却又沈下水去了。</p>

<p>前天，收到更新舞台北上邀角代表梅花館主的來信，他說，苟慧生暫時不能南來，更新秋凉開幕之第一批人馬，巳邀妥坤旦吳素秋，趙金蓉，趙嘯瀾，李硯秀，以及名伶陳少霖，李多奎等人，生旦凈來丑，行行皆有，人才之盛，實不亞於秋凉後之黃金，惟其中頗多滬人陌生人物，爰為介紹如左：</p>
<p>吳素秋</p>
<p>吳素秋崛起於故都黎園，不過數年工夫，吳之藝術，不及戲曲學校畢業之趙金蓉，侯玉蘭輩，惟姿色秀麗，與陸素娟，同以貌美著　於北國樂部，因亦走紅。吳為茍慧生之弟子，荀派戲，如「荀灌娘」「花田錯」，皆其傑作。搭李寓春之永春社甚久，去歲脫離永春社，自張一軍，此决應聘更新，尙係初决南來，觀乎李桂雲來滬之走紅，吳素秋必能大受滬人歡迎也。</p>
<p>趙金蓉</p>
<p>趙金蓉，為北平戲曲學校之高材生，戲校有旦三傑，即趙金蓉，宋德珠，侯玉蘭是也，此三人在校時，以金蓉最紅，戲校在平公演，向以金蓉為台柱，金蓉離校後，由德珠繼之，德珠去後，玉蘭始繼德珠而獨擋一面也。趙金蓉之戲，得名伶余玉琴吳富琴諸人之傳授，靑衣花衫兼優，扮相允佳，有「女蘭芳」之號。在校時，與武生王金璐，鬚生王如霖，鼎足而三，為戲校傑出人才，其藝遠在侯玉蘭之上，玉蘭來滬，能紅極一時，金蓉之紅，可望無疑問矣。更新者番雖邀來坤旦四人之多，以實際論，値得注意者，要僅金蓉一人而已。</p>
<p>趙嘯瀾</p>
<p>趙嘯瀾為尙小雲之門徒，會兩度來滬，均未走紅，前年嘗加人周信芳之移風社，始漸受顧曲人仕之注意，但求幾即晚離移風社北返。嘯瀾嗓本極佳。第以學尙過份，致反弄巧成拙，聞嘯瀾用功頗勤，返平後，藝事進步頗多，士別三日，刮目相看，嘯瀾者番捲土重來，或能一新滬人耳目也。</p>
<p>李硯秀</p>
<p>李硯秀為故都後起坤旦中之俊佼，亦尙小雲之得意弟子也，李之藝，與趙嘯瀾相伯仲，嗓音之高亢，武工之矯捷，頗有乃師風範。資格經騐，雖不及嘯瀾，但鋒鋩畢露，在平風頭之健，嘯瀾不能及也，自編新戲甚多，如「王娟娘」「劍奇緣」「碧玉怨」等，皆能獲得一般人仕之激賞，乃師小雲，最近更授以「白玉蓮」「花蕊夫人」等劇，硯秀在平獨樹一幟，出演於慶樂園。乃姊硯賓，亦工旦，私淑程玉霜，姊妹雙花，在平有「李氏雙硯」之譽，更新邀角代表，頗重其才，乃邀之與素秋金蓉嘯瀾同來也。</p>
<p>陳少霖</p>
<p>陳少霖為已故名伶陳德霖之了，少霖拜名伶張春彥為帥，春彥為今日黎園門中有數之裏子人才，以養彥之劇學高超，少霖之藝，乃非等閒可比，少霖嘗一度隨程硯秋來滬，當時以少霖之藝尙幼稚，致未能引起滬人之注意，少霖唱唸俱頗可取，做工則過於呆板，目欠目然，此外經騐閱力亦尙不够，藝較前次天蟾舞台邀來之管紹華，略勝一籌，少霖離滬已三載於茲，以高盛麟進步之速，料想少霖之藝，當非昔比，必有進展也。</p>

<h3>從舞台到銀幕（下）</h3>
<p>— 銀笛筆錄</p>
<p>—袁美雲女士口述—</p>
<p>後來到重慶去的事是沒有實現，但我們却到了香港，這是我生平最遠的「出門」了。我們在香港逗留了兩個多月，利用這時機拍了一部「女少爺」，是岳楓群演的，後來歸新華影業公司發行。</p>
<p>在香港時，南粵影業公司主人竺淸賢要求我加入南粵，簽訂幾部戲的合同，在我考慮未決的時期中，新華張善琨先生到了香港，要求我重踐舊的，因為這時新華在上海，巳恢復拍戲工作。這樣，我們終於仍回到了上海。與新華公司的合同，就是在香港簽訂的。</p>
<p>回上海後，在新華與華新（兩公司屬於一系）先後拍過四部戲，最近正開拍「西施」，我演古裝片的戲這還是破題兒第一次。</p>
<p>從影生活，並不似外界想像的那麽舒適，此中苦况有時是外人所不能盡知的，譬如我在新華，曾碰到三部戲同時開拍，「日出」的攝製地點是在甘司東路的大同攝影塲，「四潘金蓮」「情天血淚」則在亞爾培路新華廠，一天要趕三個塲子，接述十幾天由下午工作到天亮，無論那一個體格强健的人都要支撑不住，何况我又是素來孱弱的，於是除感冒之外，更患起劇烈的喉痧來，經就治於米子雲醫生，吃了七八劑藥纔得痊愈。</p>
<p>因拍戲而負傷，在攝影塲裏是常有的事，我雖然還算僥倖，但有一次藝華公司拍「小姊妹」，我也曾不幸吃了一點小苦頭，各公司的攝影塲，大概都另有地下層，拍「小姊妹」的時候是一個黑夜裏，我到化裝室去換衣服，不幸一脚踏空，立刻從地面上跌倒地穴裏，而且昏厥了過去，地穴裹滿地都是洋釘和木塊，於是我的膝上也就受了傷，雖不十分重，但當我昏厥之後醒來，是覺得非常疼痛的。這時我不必諱言，是王引從上面跳下來，將我救起的。—我因拍戲而遭意外，在六年來總算僅有這一次。</p>
<p>關於「剪綵」，這裏我需要有一點聲明：過去，我對於剪綵差不多是「有求必應」，但這實在是一件「苦差使一，如果是有秩序的公共塲所還好，吾則就不免要遭受意外之厄，就像呂宋路上海邑廟市塲開幕，我也曾大受其累，常時因觀衆像潮水一般的汹湧，完全失去了秩序，要不是陳鏗然先生攙扶了我一下，簡直使我氣都喘不過來，要仆倒在地上了。因此，為了「安全第一」起見，對於剪綵這一件事，除非是慈善性質的，是義不容辭，此外是祇能「從此謝絕」，這樣也許不免要得罪人，但希望人家能够原諒我的苦衷。</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Declares Intention to Blockade Hong Kong; Japanese Troops on Western Guangdong Line Concentrated in Guangzhou, to Reinforce Northeast Defense; Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Recaptures Shicao Village, Cutting Off the Bo-Jin Highway; Japanese Army Ambushed in Paishi Tang, Hubei Province, Two Motorboats Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to news from here today, a spokesman for the Japanese army in South China stated that a highway was recently built from Kowloon to the Chinese mainland, exclusively for transporting military supplies to the Chongqing government. Therefore, the Japanese army must cut off this road to isolate Hong Kong. At the same time, if Britain stubbornly supports Chiang Kai-shek's rule, Japan's military actions will be unavoidable. However, after the blockade begins, civilians will suffer more, as food will clearly be insufficient. (Nineteenth, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: The Japanese Army Information Bureau announced this morning that it has discovered a secret transportation line between Chinese in Hong Kong and those on the Chinese mainland, passing through Hong Kong. Japanese troops occupying Shenzhen and Shatoujiao have discovered methods for transmitting information to Hong Kong. It is claimed that after the telephone lines in the area of the railway destroyed by the Japanese army in February were repaired, the Chinese army used them until the Japanese army reoccupied the area. It is also claimed that the Chinese built a road from Shatoujiao to Hong Kong, connecting with Shantou, and all goods were transported to the mainland along this road. Therefore, the Japanese army believes it should seal off the border from Bao'an to Shatoujiao to cut off transportation between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. (Nineteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: As a result of Japanese military actions near Hong Kong, food panic has been felt near the Hong Kong border and in the markets, and prices are gradually rising. Japanese soldiers are now guarding key points at the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong, and restrictions on the transit of goods are extremely strict. (Nineteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Since the Japanese army occupied Shenzhen, Nantou, Shatoujiao, and other places, transportation with Hong Kong has been completely cut off. The Japanese army has also strictly prohibited the transportation of food and vegetables into the New Territories in these areas. Therefore, the prices of vegetables in Hong Kong have skyrocketed, indicating that the purpose of the Japanese army's actions is to intensify the blockade of Hong Kong. (Nineteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Foreign news reports that the British government, in order to maintain its interests in the Far East, will soon dispatch a battle fleet to be stationed permanently in Singapore, and will use Hong Kong as another base. The main guns of the fleet's capital ships will range from 13.5 to 15 inches in diameter. There will be six capital ships bearing the white ensign. The arrival of this fleet will not weaken British naval power in the North Sea or the Mediterranean, and its prestige in the Far East will be greatly enhanced. It is also learned that twenty British, French, and Australian warships will gather in Singapore harbor before the end of the month. (Nineteenth, special dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: It is reported that many Japanese troops from the western Guangdong border have been transferred to Guangzhou for concentration, preparing to reinforce the Northeast defense. In addition, four Japanese warships carrying more than 2,000 Northeast puppet troops arrived in Jiangmen and landed at Beijie, apparently for troop rotation. It is rumored that three Japanese soldiers from Shenzhen crossed the British border in pursuit of Chinese refugees and were detained and disarmed. The Hong Kong military has not acknowledged this. (Nineteenth, special dispatch)</p>
<p>Yichang: The war in central Hubei has become quiet. Although the Japanese army in Qianjiang occasionally comes out of the city to harass, they are all repelled by the Chinese side. In the Luohansi area, the Japanese army has attempted to cross the river secretly several times, but failed. (Eighteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: Three Japanese warships off the coast of Shayu Chong, Huiyang, have sailed elsewhere on the nineteenth. There are no traces of the Japanese army in Bao'an City and the southern section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. (Nineteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, the Japanese army in central Hubei has recently increased, and its operational bases have also been strengthened. The purpose seems to be to launch a new offensive westward to capture Yichang. However, this Japanese attempt is unlikely to succeed. (1) Because the Japanese army in central Hubei has been attacked by the Chinese army in recent weeks, and its communication lines are becoming increasingly weak. (2) Yichang is one of the Japanese army's targets for attack, and the Chinese side has long been aware of this, so defensive works have been adequately arranged. If the Japanese side wants to attack, it will suffer extreme losses. The Chinese side anticipates that when the Japanese side attacks western Hubei, it will also have operations elsewhere, with major actions in Guangdong, South China. (Nineteenth, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Jincheng has been under attack by the Chinese army for several days, suffering many casualties. Over two thousand Japanese troops, reinforced from Bo'ai on the fourteenth, launched a counterattack against the Chinese side with intense artillery fire and the use of poison gas. The Chinese officers and soldiers were exceptionally brave, repeatedly thwarting the Japanese army. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the suburbs. A part of the Japanese army sneaked to the vicinity of Nanshi Dian, northeast of Jincheng, the other day and was intercepted by the Chinese army, with over a hundred casualties. Nanshi Cao Village, south of Jincheng, has been recaptured by the Chinese army, and the Bo-Jin Highway is cut off. Four or five hundred Japanese infantry and artillery troops from Tianhu Pass and the Jinmiao area sneaked to counterattack, and after another brave charge by the Chinese army, fierce fighting continued until noon on the seventeenth. (Nineteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiushui: At the ball field more than ten miles southwest of Wuning, a skirmish occurred between the Chinese and Japanese armies on the morning of the eighteenth, killing more than twenty Japanese officers and soldiers. (Nineteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde: A certain unit of the Chinese army, in conjunction with the local regiment headquarters, launched attacks against the Japanese army encountered in Taolin, Zhongfang, Yunxi, and other places for several days, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers and seizing many supplies. (Nineteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Xi'an: More than a thousand Japanese troops in the Liujia Village and Aoxiang Village area, southeast of Yicheng, launched an attack on the Nanma Village and Qilipo area at noon on the fourteenth. They were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, retreated along their original route. (Nineteenth dispatch) In Shashi, on the morning of the fifteenth, more than 30,000 Japanese troops sneaked to harass the vicinity of Changshou. The Chinese army met them with a head-on attack, and after two hours of fierce fighting, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The Chinese army took the opportunity to suddenly launch an offensive, attacking in multiple directions, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and killing many Japanese soldiers, whose corpses littered the countryside. The Japanese troops fled in panic. At the moment, the Chinese army is taking advantage of the victory to advance towards the Jing-Zhong Road. (Nineteenth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Japanese Planes的分批襲川湘 Attack Sichuan and Hunan in Batches; Jiading and Liuyang Bombed; Details of Losses Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, over a hundred Japanese bombers flew upstream from Hankou, some of which flew to western Hunan, while the remaining eighty were divided into two teams, one with fifty-three planes and the other with twenty-seven, entered the Sichuan province border and flew towards Chongqing. Several teams of Chinese fighter planes, upon hearing the alarm, immediately took off to prepare for interception, flying very high, so the number of Chinese planes could not be estimated, but it must be very large, because the sound of the planes was deafening. The weather was clear and visibility was good, which was favorable for the defenders. The public all predicted that there would be a fierce battle in the sky. However, after the Japanese planes appeared in the southern suburbs of the occupied city, they did not attempt to cross the Chinese plane line, but continued to fly west and dropped bombs in Jiading, and some planes circled over Zigong. After some time, they flew back to their downstream base, without dropping bombs on the city of Chongqing. (Nineteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: At 10:20 this morning, an air raid alarm was issued here, lasting for four hours, until 2:30 in the afternoon when the alarm was lifted. However, the Japanese planes did not fly into the city's airspace. According to semi-official sources, it is confirmed that one hundred Japanese planes departed from Hankou, but twenty-five of them flew to Liuyang, Hunan, to bomb, and seventy-five flew to the Sichuan border. It is also learned that Japanese planes flew to Jiangjin, sixty miles southwest of Chongqing, and the extent of the bombing losses is still under investigation. (Nineteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: At 10:00 on the morning of the nineteenth, eight Japanese planes sneaked into the airspace above Luoyang City from the north bank of the Yellow River. After intense shooting by the local air defense forces, they dropped eight bombs and flew southeast via Linru. The losses were minimal. (Nineteenth dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Way Out of Distress</h3>
<p>Recently, Shanghai citizens have generally felt a bit distressed. The reasons for this distress are nothing more than two: one is the oppression of life, and the other is the threat of the environment.</p>
<p>The oppression of life did not begin today, but it is currently accelerating and intensifying. From food, fuel, and cloth to all daily necessities, prices have more than doubled in one or two months. Those who live on salaries, of course, are all lamenting; even those who run industrial and commercial enterprises are feeling the strain due to the increase in their own costs and the reduction in general purchasing power. As for the general working masses and the tens of thousands of unemployed and refugee groups, their suffering is, of course, indescribable. As this situation progresses, a great crisis will inevitably be lurking in the isolated island society, which everyone can feel.</p>
<p>However, the oppression of life is still obvious and easy to recognize; as for the threat of the environment, the signs are subtle, but the seriousness of the content is no less than the former. Recently, rumors have been spreading that the Japanese side has new intentions for Shanghai. The so-called new intentions may be like the "blockade" of Tianjin. Although a Japanese spokesman issued a statement on the sixteenth of this month denying the blockade, saying something like "a blockade is possible, but it may not happen"; however, judging from the recent intense statements in Japanese newspapers in Shanghai, advocating the takeover of the Special District Court, advocating the confiscation of Chinese merchant banks, and criticizing the supply of the isolated army, etc., we can see the intentions of the Japanese side, and there are some clues to be found. Looking again at the method of controlling vegetables recently announced by the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai, stipulating that vegetables from Puxi must first pass through Hongkou when they arrive in Shanghai, although this matter has not been implemented as scheduled, it has not been declared abandoned. There is also the sudden rise in the price of rice in Shanghai, although it is said to be due to the manipulation of hoarders; but according to the statements of villagers who came to Shanghai, all said that because of various restrictions, rice from the surrounding villages could not reach Shanghai. This fact can be seen as a harbinger of a blockade, or, to put it more seriously, this is a kind of invisible blockade, or a chronic blockade. Looking again at the anti-British demonstrations on August 13th in Hongkou, western Shanghai, and various suburbs, and openly distributing leaflets in the sky against Chiang and against Britain; and in a corner of the lawless zone, thugs have recently been rampant, and even the swords pointed at an innocent Dane, Mr. Krogh, who was killed. According to Western newspapers, this was also the work of thugs in the lawless zone, in order to intimidate the general foreigners in Shanghai. Judging from various situations, the threat of the environment is indeed intensifying, just like the oppression of life. In short, although British Chamberlain's concessions on the Tianjin issue have not satisfied the greed of the Japanese warlords, it is possible, though not inevitable, that the Japanese warlords will seek further compensation in Shanghai. Moreover, since the Japanese military in China cannot continue to advance, there have been repeated rumors of changing new strategies recently, among which the fundamental eradication of international forces in the Far East is one of the so-called new strategy contents. Therefore, the current eagerness to solve the Shanghai issue and attempt to destroy the last fortress of international forces in the Far East is, of course, one end of the Japanese strategy. This is sufficient to show that the Shanghai citizens' understanding of the environmental threat cannot be regarded as an over-consideration.</p>
<p>Having distress, we must seek a way out. Wandering and hesitating is not a way out; suicide and surrender are not ways out either. The way out is specific, different according to each person's needs and abilities; but before finding a way out, there is a common principle, that is, psychological calmness. Calmness is not bowing to fate, nor is it waiting to be slaughtered, but using a calm mind, analyzing the current situation with reason, and then, according to subjective and objective conditions, choosing one's own way out.</p>
<p>The oppression of life and the threat of the environment, although seemingly two completely different things, actually have the same way out. Because the soaring black market exchange rate has led to the high prices of goods, and the limitation of sources has led to the lack of commodities, although the nature of the event is economic, the reason for the event is political. Therefore, the progress or relief of the state of life oppression will inevitably change with the environmental threat situation, and the key to the so-called way out of distress is only in the environmental end. Speaking of the situation of Shanghai's environment, there is certainly the possibility of becoming a second Tianjin, but it may not be realized immediately. Because Shanghai is, after all, the last fortress of international forces in the Far East, and it is also the last line of defense for the Japanese to attack international forces in China, and it is not like the British concession in Tianjin, which is only related to one country, Britain. If it is launched, it will involve many things, and I am afraid it will be out of control, and the Japanese side has no confidence in whether the result is good or bad; therefore, although the Japanese side is eager to plan for Shanghai, they dare not act too hastily. However, even if you don't have to act too hastily, why not use gradual means to gradually devour it? Therefore, whether Shanghai will be blockaded or become the second Tianjin is only a matter of form; as for the essence, the deterioration of Shanghai's environment will inevitably become worse day by day.</p>
<p>No matter how the recent situation in Shanghai develops, the thorough removal of the evil atmosphere in the environment will inevitably be on the day of China's final victory in the war of resistance, which is inevitable in fact. At present, because Shanghai citizens cannot bear the distress, perhaps some want to leave Shanghai. Leaving Shanghai and going to the inland is certainly the best way out, but it is by no means a generally feasible thing at present. Those who have come to Shanghai from the occupied areas to take refuge may want to return to their hometowns; but it is certainly good to return to places in the countryside that are completely isolated from the Japanese puppets; if you return to the occupied cities, then it is no different from being decorations for the Japanese puppets, and fundamentally it is exactly what the Japanese puppets want, so why bother to fulfill them now? As for those who cannot leave and stay on the isolated island, how to break the distress at present, then only follow the recent admonition of President Chiang Kai-shek to the Shanghai compatriots, that is, to build a strong spiritual fortress. The citizens of Shanghai should remember: only the day of the final victory of the war of resistance is the day when the citizens of Shanghai truly get rid of their pain, so the current task is only to be of one heart and one mind, to build the will of more than four million citizens into a strong Great Wall, on the one hand, to constantly fight against the environment, and on the other hand, to use all our strength to support the government and promote the early arrival of victory.</p>
<h3>Actual Breakdown of Tokyo Negotiations; Japan to Intensify Blockade of Tianjin Concession; Anglo-Japanese Representatives' Meeting Ended Unhappily Yesterday; Japanese Military Decides Tianjin Japanese Army to Act According to Circumstances; Britain Notifies the United States of its Views on Economic Issues</h3>
<p>Tokyo: After the British government decided to conduct the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the issues of currency and silver reserves proposed by Japan solely on an Anglo-Japanese basis, without yielding beneficial results, the Anglo-Japanese negotiations are now encountering a serious crisis. This decision of the British government is in direct opposition to Japan's opinion. Japan believes that economic and political issues must be regarded as an integral part of the agenda and resolved through negotiation. After the British Ambassador Craigie informed the Japanese representatives of the British government's decision, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma immediately canceled his plans for a weekend getaway, which shows the seriousness of the situation arising from the British government's decision. After a meeting of administrative personnel of the Army Ministry this morning, the Foreign and Army Ministries held a joint meeting. Foreign Minister Arita and Army Minister Itagaki will meet with Prime Minister Hiranuma this afternoon to decide the government's attitude towards the Anglo-Japanese conference. Japanese observers believe that the British government's decision aims to (1) independently establish an agreement on Tianjin police affairs, indefinitely postponing the Tokyo talks; (2) submit economic issues, such as the prohibition of the circulation of Chinese legal tender, to an international conference of relevant countries; (3) form a common front with France and the United States, exerting economic pressure on the establishment of a new order in East Asia to protect its own interests in the Far East. According to Japanese observers, Britain underestimates Japan's economic power, leading to such an attempt. Japan absolutely cannot accept the British decision. At the same time, almost all Japanese newspapers demand that the Japanese government immediately stop the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the beneficiary of the success of the Tokyo negotiations is Britain, while the success or failure of the negotiations is not of great concern to Japan. Since North China is now in Japan's control, once Japan declares its determination to protect its interests with all its strength, it makes no difference whether Britain accepts Japan's declaration or not. The Japanese government should stop the Tokyo negotiations at this time to avoid repeated delays and being manipulated by Britain. Moreover, the sufferer after the failure of the talks is Britain, not Japan. The Miyako Shimbun pointed out that there are two reasons for Britain's delaying policy: (1) Trust that the Danzig issue can be resolved peacefully; (2) Want to wait and see what policy Japan will adopt towards the new European situation. Japan should urge Britain to reopen the meeting within a limited period to prevent Britain from changing its attitude and destroying the meeting after the Danzig issue has a result and Japan's policy towards Europe has been decided. If Britain does not comply with this request, the responsibility for all consequences of the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese conference will be borne by the British side. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: After an important meeting of administrative personnel of the Army Ministry this morning, it is heard that it has been decided to allow the Tianjin Japanese army authorities to consider how to resolve the Tianjin issue, as it is believed that the negotiations on the Tianjin incident have actually broken down. According to the Army Ministry's opinion, the Tokyo talks were held at the request of the British side, with the aim of seeking a resolution to the Tianjin dispute. Japan has long stated that the Tianjin issue can only be resolved if Britain abandons its policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek. Now the British side proposes not to discuss economic issues and wants to postpone the Tokyo talks, which is nothing short of a breakdown of negotiations. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Army authorities convened a joint meeting of provincial and departmental leaders on the morning of the 19th, and solemnly discussed the future strategy of the Anglo-Japanese talks. As a result, it was decided to proceed according to the established policy with the following attitude: (1) The Anglo-Japanese Tokyo talks are aimed at resolving the issue of the blockade of the Tianjin concession and are held in response to the British request. In order to achieve this goal, and due to the necessity of ensuring the security of the local army, it is an absolutely necessary condition for the British side to abandon its policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek and resolve the security and economic issues of the concession. (2) Although Britain has largely acknowledged general principles and security issues in accordance with Japanese demands in this meeting, it has constantly postponed the discussion of economic issues, putting the meeting in a state of suspension. Therefore, the Tokyo talks have in fact broken down, and there is no other way to negotiate in the future except to shift the negotiations to the local level. (3) The Japanese local army authorities have repeatedly stated that in order to establish security in the concession, the relationship between security and economic issues is inseparable, and Japan will not recognize any separation. (4) Therefore, if the British side suddenly repents and expresses sincerity to the Japanese side, but because the meeting has ended unsuccessfully, the future measures can only be freely undertaken by the local army authorities, and the result will be the strengthening of the blockade of the concession, which is of course the case. (Dōmei, 19th) London: The British government has openly stated to Japan that the issue of Chinese silver and token currency will not be discussed alone by Britain without the participation of other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. At the same time, it will continue to lend 3 million pounds to China. Current affairs observers believe that Britain has decided to abandon its policy of appeasement in the Far East and is no longer prepared to make any concessions to Japan. This is significantly different from when Britain concluded a preliminary agreement with Japan and expressed its willingness to hand over Chinese suspects. The reasons for Britain's hardening attitude towards Japan are: to show close ties with the United States' Far East policy, as the United States has already announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and at the same time, when Britain surrenders again in Tokyo, it will purchase a large amount of silver from China. Furthermore, in order to dispel the Soviet Union's doubts about Britain and promote the early establishment of a tripartite military alliance, Britain must also adopt a tough attitude towards Japan, as the Soviet Union has largely regarded the Anglo-Japanese talks as another appeasement policy. According to a senior official here, Anglo-Japanese relations are gradually moving from a cloudy secret state to a stormy stage. Japanese sources here say that Japan is determined to reject the British proposal to resolve the currency and legal tender circulation issues through a Nine-Power Treaty conference. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>London: Non-British diplomatic circles predicted last night that after Britain refused to discuss the currency system and silver issues with Japan alone, the talks between Britain and Japan in Tokyo would break down. Japanese sources here believe that the British government's decision will strengthen the position of Japanese militarists and bring Japan closer to the Italo-German military alliance, which is the goal of the Japanese military. Well-informed sources said that Britain's decision to refuse to negotiate with Japan on the issue of silver and currency in North China was made solely by the British government. However, Britain will consider the views of relevant countries, including the United States and France. Britain also notified the United States, France, and China of its new decision. When the British government sent a new instruction to British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie yesterday, it instructed him to immediately notify the Japanese government, saying, "Continuing to negotiate the silver and currency issues separately between Britain and Japan will not yield beneficial results." The new instruction also hinted that Britain supports reconvening the 1937 Brussels Conference (the Nine-Power Treaty signatory conference). In its note to Japan, Britain indicated that while it acknowledges the issues of silver and currency, it cannot stand aside when the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and other relevant treaties make any final discussions on the current situation in China. The relevant powers must be given the opportunity to express their views on these issues. A British government spokesman stated here that the British Ambassador to Japan notified the leader of the Japanese delegation, Kato, "If economic issues are to be discussed further, both sides must be prepared to consider the views of the relevant powers." The spokesman explained that there has been progress in the negotiations on the agreement to maintain order in Tianjin. He believes that the agreement can be signed separately, but he frankly doubts whether the Japanese side will agree to this. News from Tokyo confirmed the spokesman's belief.

<p>Washington: Under Secretary of State Welles told reporters today that the British government had notified the United States government that Britain had refused to discuss various economic issues with Japan in the Tokyo talks, as such issues involve other countries and the United States is also concerned. This was stated in Secretary of State Hull's statement on June 19. As for convening a conference of signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to discuss China's economic and monetary issues, this is a possibility, but no one has yet contacted the United States on this matter. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the Tokyo talks, after the British government refused to discuss the currency issue, the Daily Express recently published an editorial, expressing its delight at this firm attitude, stating, "The British government's refusal to discuss economic issues related to the whole of China with Japan is the right thing to do. Although there are anti-British protesters shouting threatening slogans around the British Embassy in Tokyo, Britain will not be moved by them. At this time, the British government should represent the people and announce to Japan that Japan's oppression by taking advantage of our danger has aroused animosity in Britain and will remain in our memory forever and cannot be dispelled in a short period of time. Once the current situation is clarified, when new problems arise in the world situation, Japan may regret it." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris: Well-informed sources here have expressed great approval of Britain's refusal to discuss Japan's demands regarding Chinese silver and currency, recognizing that they are not purely Anglo-Japanese issues. It is said that France has adopted the same position as Britain. The French government has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Henri, to explain to the Japanese government that various issues, such as the handover of Chinese silver reserves and the prohibition of the circulation of Chinese legal tender, should be negotiated by the relevant countries. It is heard that the British government has notified the Japanese government that it has decided that if the silver reserves and legal tender issues in China are discussed separately by Britain and Japan, there is no hope of obtaining beneficial results. When any further discussions are held on such economic proposals in the future, the views of other relevant countries must be heard. Although the British government has always acknowledged that the issue cannot be ignored when making any final discussions on the current situation in China, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and other relevant treaties must be given the opportunity to express their views.

<h3>Tianjin Haihe River; South Bank Collapses; Special District 1 in Danger of Being Flooded; Water Level Five Feet Above River Surface</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Mr. Tretjakew, an engineer with the Haihe Conservancy Commission, recently told the British authorities that the south bank is in a dangerous state. The river water there is one foot higher than the level reached by the 1917 flood. Although various efforts are being made to prevent a breach, the danger of flooding has not been eliminated. If it does flood and the river water rushes in, then Special District 1, the former German concession, will bear the brunt, and then it will inevitably spread to the boundary of the British concession. The British authorities are working rapidly to curb the river flooding. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The threat of flooding in Tianjin began to materialize today. According to an official announcement made by the Haihe Conservancy Commission at 10 p.m. tonight, the south bank has collapsed, and Special District 1 is in danger of being flooded. An official who answered the phone at the Haihe Conservancy Commission provided the above information, but no other details. It is not yet known when the flood will reach Special District 1, but it will probably be within a few hours. Several brave British youths went to the countryside today to observe the flood situation at the risk of their lives. It is said that the flood is rushing in from the bank like a waterfall, and its sound can be heard from afar. It is heard that the water outside the bank is five feet above the river surface, and the ground floors of all buildings in the concession may be flooded. Most stores are now moving goods before the flood arrives. According to various American expatriates who returned to the concession from the countryside, the tennis courts there have been submerged. The water level rose very rapidly this afternoon, and as a result, the gardens of the club have become a flooded area. The racecourse has also been flooded. According to the opinions of the American expatriates, judging from the speed at which the water level is rising, it is feared that the inner bank has collapsed, but this claim has not yet been officially confirmed, because the persons in charge of the Haihe Conservancy Commission are currently outside directing flood prevention work. According to the commission's report, the water outside the flood prevention dyke has risen to an unprecedented height and is continuing to rise rapidly. The southeastern part of Special District 3 is also in danger of being flooded. If the inner dyke collapses, the flood in Tianjin may be two feet higher than the flood in 1917. At the same time, all places along the river have been flooded, but the river water has not overflowed because it has been blocked by the newly built mud dam. In British Central Avenue and other low-lying areas, water is still gushing out of the ditches, and the roads are all wet. Reuters and other companies' residences have piled up sandbags or bricks in front of their doors, hoping to prevent water from flowing in. However, according to a document released by the Haihe Conservancy Commission, the water level in the concession may reach four or five feet, so the above-mentioned protective measures may not be effective. At present, flood prevention work in the concession is extremely difficult due to a lack of manpower. In addition, the price of sacks is soaring. Yesterday, the Beining Railway was blocked by water between Qinhuangdao and Tangshan, but it has now been restored. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The British escort ship HMS Sandwich arrived here this afternoon. Together with the HMS Bittern, which was originally stationed here, there are now two British warships in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Government Concerned About Shanghai Concessions; Japan Plotting Against Concessions; Subsequent Situation Will Become More Tense</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Political figures here are paying keen attention to the news from Shanghai that the Japanese army, navy, and diplomatic representatives stationed in Shanghai have been ordered to return to Tokyo to receive instructions on Japan's action plan for the Shanghai International Settlement. It is said that Japan is attempting to demand that the concession authorities hand over the "isolated army" and the Chinese Special District Court. Although this news has not yet been confirmed, all newspapers here have published it with alarming headlines, believing that the situation in Shanghai will become more tense. The Chinese authorities will not hesitate to issue statements on the "isolated army" and the court. Government officials have also discussed the attitude to be adopted in the event of a blockade of Shanghai, as the Chinese government is still extremely concerned about the international settlement, but it is not known whether it has exchanged views on this matter with the concession authorities or relevant countries. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a statement regarding the Japanese request to hand over the "isolated army" in Shanghai, saying that according to a Reuters report on the 17th, Japanese newspapers in Shanghai are agitating to hand over the "isolated army" housed by the Shanghai Municipal Council to the Japanese authorities. The main reason is that the Shanghai Municipal Council has been bearing the living expenses of this "isolated army" since the National Government was unable to remit funds. The groundlessness of this claim can be immediately proved by the real facts. According to information provided by the British Embassy in China, the Shanghai Municipal Council paid a total of 43,600 yuan for the living expenses of this "isolated army" until the end of March of this year. This expense was ordered to be paid by the Ministry of Finance in April, and the Chinese government also promised at the same time to repay the Shanghai Municipal Council for all subsequent advances for the living expenses of the "isolated army." From this, it can be seen that the so-called inability of the National Government to pay for the living expenses of the "isolated army" is purely a fabrication by the Japanese side. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council has fulfilled its friendly obligation by housing this "isolated army" in the international settlement, we hope that it will continue to provide them with protection in accordance with ordinary practice, and will not listen to the Japanese side's unreasonable demands and arbitrarily extradite them.

<h3>Guangdong Puppet Regime to Launch Anti-British Movement in South China; Demanding Britain to Change its Policy of Aiding China as a Condition; Anti-British Movement in North China Still Expanding</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: The director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Security Committee officially announced today that there is a possibility of a violent anti-British movement occurring. The Chinese employed by the British are in danger of being intimidated. It is said that the momentum of the anti-British movement is growing, and he is now trying to prevent it from becoming violent. He has received many submissions from various groups in the city urging local officials to step up the anti-British movement, including demands that all Chinese employed by the British in Shamian be dismissed, otherwise their lives will be endangered. He does not know what to do. The final decision will depend on the outcome of the Tokyo talks. The new regime is willing to maintain friendship with the British, but if the Tokyo talks fail, local officials will no longer be able to curb the anti-British movement. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Japanese militarists today tried to include a new element in the anti-British movement in North China. A spokesman for the Japanese army here claimed that Communists are trying to control the anti-British movement. The spokesman said emphatically that the Chinese Communist Party has ordered its members to participate in the movement and cause illegal acts. The reporters did not believe this easily and asked questions. The spokesman replied that the movement is so large that it has not reached a point where the Japanese cannot control it. One reporter asked, "Is the situation already difficult to control?" The spokesman said yes. At the same time, Chinese employees of the British continued to receive mailed letters threatening death. The sender's address on the envelopes was written as "Salvation Army Headquarters," with the intention of facilitating the mailing of the letters. The Chinese employees of Reuters in Beiping also received this threatening letter, which stated that they would be killed if they did not resign immediately. This was the second letter of the same nature they had received in the past few days, which naturally had an impact on those who were more disturbed. Some of them have already resigned, but most are still working, distributing Reuters news throughout the city to European, Chinese, and Japanese subscribers, and still doing translation work in the office.

<h3>Japanese Army Suffers Losses at Fengjing Station on Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</h3>
<p>Jinhua: On the night of the 15th, the Chinese army attacked Fengjing Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and engaged in battle with the Japanese army, killing eight Japanese soldiers and six puppet soldiers, seizing several Type 38 rifles, and destroying three bridges. They returned to their original defenses safely. Also, on the night of the 14th, the Chinese army attacked Nanxun Town (east of Wuxing), destroying a blockhouse at the street entrance of the town and killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers.

<h3>Chinese Army Wins Great Victory on Baotou Beach</h3>
<p>Yulin: The Chinese army won a great victory on Baotou Beach. The details are as follows: The fighting in the Dacheng West area on the 11th was extremely fierce. On the afternoon of the 12th, eight Japanese aircraft bombed twice. At the same time, more than 30 armored vehicles, covering nearly a thousand cavalry artillerymen, advanced towards Dacheng West, Wantai Hing, and other places, firing many cannons from noon to night. A certain commander who shocked the Japanese army in Dingfugu, Kebao, last year personally went to the front line to command, and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army from three sides. The morale of the Chinese army was high, and everyone bravely rushed to the front. A certain battalion commander who fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Dongsheng City for three days and three nights last year, and finally repelled the Japanese army, was also on the front line of Baotou Beach, fighting with the Japanese army, charging directly at the Japanese front. After six hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was attacked by the Chinese army from three sides, suffered heavy casualties, and finally retreated to Dashiwan. The Chinese army captured Qiaolin and Zhaowanggui and other places. The pursuit troops surrounded Dashiwan. From the 13th, the Japanese army tried to defend Dashiwan and dared not go out, only sending out hungry soldiers to scout around. (Dispatch of the 17th)</p>

<h3>Pope of Rome Calls for Peace; Holds Lengthy Meeting with U.S. Postmaster General</h3>
<p>The Vatican: Today is the 25th anniversary of the death of the late Pope Pius X. Pope Pius XII received many pilgrims at the Castel Gandolfo palace and blessed them, saying, "At this moment, the people of all countries are once again uneasy and feel distressed. We have worked to eliminate the crisis of war and plan to unite all countries to establish peace based on justice, so as to protect the freedom and honor of all nations. We wish to take this opportunity to pray for peace for Italy, for all of Europe, and for the whole world. We still believe that if all countries can maintain a moderate and fair spirit, they can avert disaster. We hope that the authorities of all countries will not lightly start a war and become sinners for all ages." (Havas dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Castel Gandolfo: Pope Pius XII recently received U.S. Postmaster General Farley at the palace and had a long conversation with him. Postmaster General Farley is a close friend of President Roosevelt. (Havas dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Authorities Worried About European Situation</h3>
<p>Washington: People from all walks of life here, including those close to the White House, are increasingly worried about the latest developments in the European situation. President Roosevelt is taking a vacation on a ship on the Atlantic Ocean and is receiving reports via wireless telegraph at any time. People in the government are all showing signs of worry. Some political observers even say that the current situation in Europe is more serious than it was in September last year. (Havas dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<h3>Latin America's Relations with Japan Follows the Lead of the U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington: According to news from here today, Latin American countries are closely watching the relations between the U.S. and Japan. Diplomats from Latin American countries mostly believe that the countries of the Western Hemisphere must take consistent or parallel actions. In other words, Latin American countries must follow the lead of the United States. If the Japanese navy conducts deep-sea exercises off the coasts of Latin American countries, the United States will immediately take defensive measures. (Associated Press dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<h3>Military Diplomacy Work Together: Germany Attempts to Control Central and Eastern Europe, Heavy Troops Gather on Polish Border, Actively Pushing Encirclement Policy, Romanian People Uneasy</h3>
<p>Paris: The French Foreign Ministry continued to receive reports last night of German troops concentrating on the Polish border. German troops continued to be transported to Königsberg in East Prussia, developing towards the Polish Silesian border. This time, the deployment of heavy troops to Silesia gives the German army great power in both the western and northern borders, because Germany already had heavy troops stationed in the western border. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>London: The Warsaw correspondent of the "News Chronicle" reports that 15,000 German army personnel, originally stationed mostly in Bavaria, have now been transferred to Slovakia to concentrate, with some stationed near the Polish border. More than seventy trains of barbed wire have been transported there. The Slovak authorities have also been ordered to accelerate the completion of all military highways leading to the Polish border. In addition, the Austrian troops originally stationed on the border between Slovakia and Germany, because they were friendly with the Slovak residents and the Czechs in the protectorate of Bohemia, were considered "unreliable" by the authorities and have been withdrawn, replaced by troops sent from Germany proper. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to sources here, the new military treaty signed between Germany and Slovakia on August 17 does not contain provisions for Germany to increase its troop presence in Slovakia or expand its military activities there. The treaty only delineates the boundaries of military zones in certain areas and corrects geographically unsuitable situations caused by previous treaties. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the reports in British and French newspapers that Germany has concluded a military agreement with Slovakia, authoritative sources here have solemnly denied it, stating that the locations where German troops are stationed are all within the boundaries delineated by the German-Slovak agreement in March of this year. No German troops are present in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, but the German military delegation to Slovakia has now been changed to a military advisory group, maintaining contact with the stationed troops. (Haitong Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The establishment of a military agreement between Germany and Slovakia has been commented on by government figures here, stating that this agreement is tantamount to a military alliance treaty. Although the reality has long existed, the conclusion of an agreement now only legally recognizes it. However, the number of German troops and military equipment in Slovakia will inevitably increase as a result. The intention is clearly to encircle Poland. It is known that the so-called encirclement policy has not been pursued by Western European countries, but Germany is making every effort to promote it. As for the relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union, recent developments have been satisfactory, and commercial relations are permitted. The Soviet government had previously increased its troop presence in the Polish border area but has now voluntarily withdrawn them, demonstrating the close friendship between the two countries. As for the relationship between Poland and Romania, the alliance treaty between the two countries (established in 1921) in principle only guarantees Romania's eastern border, but when necessary, the scope of military cooperation between the two sides should be expanded. Furthermore, as for the relationship between Poland and Hungary, there has been no change recently, but this place is paying close attention to Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky's visits to Germany and Italy with considerable anxiety. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: The concentration of German troops in Slovakia is causing concern among Romanians, who fear that Germany may seek to take action in Romania because it has failed to achieve its goals in Danzig. Although Romania has an alliance treaty with Poland, its original intention was to defend against the Soviet Union, not against Germany. Today, Germany can disregard Hungary's consent and use the Carpathian Ruthenia province of Hungary (formerly part of Czechoslovakia) to attack Romania, penetrating deep into the hinterland and cutting off the Polish and Romanian troops into two parts, annihilating the Romanian army in one fell swoop. At that time, not only would it seize large quantities of oil and wheat, but it would also control the mouth of the Danube and gain a foothold on the Black Sea coast. In military terms, it could obtain a good base from which to move troops south and invade the Mediterranean, which would not be difficult. This move is far more important in material and spiritual terms than the annexation of Danzig to Germany. It is rumored that Hungary will soon join the alliance treaty between Germany and Italy, and Germany is exerting pressure on Yugoslavia to allow Germany to control the railway line connecting Vienna to the Italian port of Trieste (passing through Croatia) in wartime. All of these things are causing anxiety among the Romanians. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Remain Calm, Watching the Evolution of the Situation, Reaffirming Their Determination to Resist Violence</h3>
<p>Paris: As news of the international situation becomes increasingly tense, mostly from Berlin, Paris remains calm as usual. At the same time, all possibilities have been anticipated and preparations are being made to respond. Britain has granted Poland a credit loan to purchase everything needed for national defense, which is particularly noteworthy. A semi-official statement summarizes Paris's views on the international situation as follows: The British and French governments are now observing the evolution of the situation with great calmness. The positions of the two governments have been stated several times. France and Britain are determined to resist force, regardless of the form it takes. It is not known whether the various news reports reaching Paris are a sign of an intimidation campaign or a test of strength, but France and Britain remain calm and are determined to adhere to their responsibilities. According to opinions in French political and diplomatic circles, the international situation will remain serious for some time. Germany is now continuing its military plans, the slightest hair of which has reached the point of disrupting the national economy and hindering the supply of necessities for civilians. Since August 15, several batches of reservists have been recalled into the military, and there are also reports of important troop concentrations, said to be from East Prussia and Upper Silesia. Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky's frequent meetings with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop are also a factor that makes people uneasy. The hasty return of the ambassadors to Germany and Italy to their countries and Mussolini's convocation of a meeting of army leaders are also enough to make people uneasy. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris: As the Axis powers are actively engaged in military and diplomatic activities, responsible sources here have commented, "If any violent actions occur again at this time, no matter where they occur, Britain and France will definitely resist them. The current international situation is indeed serious, and the recent actions taken by the Axis powers are increasingly convincing." (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>London: The British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, met with the German State Secretary Weizsäcker this afternoon and reaffirmed Britain's position in a firm tone, stating that Britain would definitely fulfill its guarantee obligations to Poland. Britain's position is evident in its refusal of Germany's suggestion to mediate the issue of the Free City of Danzig. Regarding this matter, German leader Hitler said to League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, Burckhardt, some time ago that Britain should immediately send a senior official to Germany to discuss the Danzig issue. The British side believes that this matter is exactly the same as Prime Minister Chamberlain's flight to Berchtesgaden, Germany, in September of last year, and immediately rejected it. This is what happened at that time, and it has been kept secret all along, only to be revealed today. However, it is widely rumored that the Vatican or Hungary will mediate the Danzig issue. Upon hearing this, the British side is paying close attention. It is reported that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky's visit to Rome to hold talks with the Italian authorities is not unrelated to this rumor. Sources close to the government here said that Hungary is a friendly country to Poland and has close relations with the Axis powers. If it can act as a mediator, it would be quite suitable, but whether it can be effective is doubtful, because Germany's attitude is becoming increasingly tough, as State Secretary Weizsäcker made clear to Ambassador Henderson today.

<h3>Britain and France Discuss Treaty Provisions, France and Poland Establish Loan Agreement</h3>
<p>London: Regarding Germany's demand for the cession of the Polish Corridor, the British government is responding with practical actions. Yesterday, important British and Polish officials began discussing the final draft of the military alliance. Polish Foreign Ministry legal advisor, Kulski, and the Polish ambassador to Britain, Raczyński, continued to discuss the issue of mutual military assistance with British legal experts in order to determine the final form of the alliance. According to well-informed sources, the validity period of the treaty is usually limited to five years, but it can be extended with the consent of both parties. The British government is now calmly preparing everything to cope with the serious situation within two weeks. It is heard that the British government believes that a European war may not be unavoidable, but the serious crisis is imminent. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Berlin Vigorously Promotes the Idea That the Current Situation Is Unbearable, Saying the Key to Peace or War Lies in Britain's Attitude, Nuremberg Congress Decided to Proceed as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Berlin: The official newspapers are now daily calling for the current situation to be considered unbearable and for the Danzig issue to be resolved urgently without further delay. Therefore, well-informed sources expect that there will be developments before the National Socialist Party Congress to be held in Nuremberg on September 2, because the current level of propaganda campaign seems unlikely to continue for three weeks. German passersby who have not forgotten the events of a year ago now read the newspaper's tone and expect an incident soon. They believe that in the best case, Hitler can get Danzig without firing a shot, but this kind of success has little significance for ordinary citizens in Germany. In the worst case, Europe may not be able to avoid the whirlpool of war. At the same time, senior German officials in their conversations give the impression that Berlin still cannot be without doubt whether Britain is truly willing to go to war with Germany for Poland. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The monthly magazine "Berlin Rome Tokyo" published an article giving a serious warning to the world Poland, allowing it to be Britain, and advising them to reconsider their attitude and purpose. It is believed that this article was written by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, so special attention is paid to it. The article stated that the world must understand the effectiveness of the German-Italian alliance, which not only depends on concrete interests and undeniable rights, but also decides on issues related to national honor. The Danzig issue, in terms of its survival, allows the methods used by Britain's intervention in recent months to put it at the forefront, which will eventually become an unbearable burden for German national honor. British policy has made it impossible for the Danzig issue and related issues to be resolved through negotiations between Germany and Poland. Western democratic countries have led Poland to hold an arrogant attitude towards Germany and Germans living in Poland, and have put German-Polish friendship in an extremely tense state. The agitation of the Polish people has also made it impossible for Germany and Poland to calmly discuss the issues. The Polish government is no longer able to control the overall situation in Poland, so the British government has placed the responsibility for resolving peace or war in the hands of the blind and impatient. As for what has already been decided at the Salzburg meeting, the only answer that can be given is that the powers engaged in encirclement, including Poland, can no longer tolerate any moral, political, or other provocative actions against Germany. Our two allied countries will unite as one to curb it. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin: There have been many rumors here lately, saying that the National Socialist Party Congress originally scheduled to be held in Nuremberg in early September will now be postponed. Political figures here have denied it. The 25th anniversary of the Battle of Tannenberg is also scheduled to be held as scheduled on the 27th of this month. (Haitong dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany's Demands on Poland Expand, Want to Restore Pre-War Borders</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Most of the 200 National Socialist Party members arrested in Upper Silesia have now been released pending investigation of the results of the charges of being border scouts and engaging in "provocative activities." A Polish official spokesman claimed today that German demands now seem to have expanded, including not only Danzig but also the Corridor and Polish Silesia. Therefore, it indicates that the issue is very broad, stating that Germany wants to return to its 1914 borders. It is rumored here that the German secret police have closed the headquarters of the Polish Overseas Chinese Federation in Berlin and the Slavic Bank building. A team of Polish students going to Monaco for a sports competition was stopped by the German authorities in Bohemia yesterday and forced to return to Poland. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Danzig New Army Parades, Forster Awards Flags</h3>
<p>Danzig: The Danzig New Army (whose existence was previously denied months ago) publicly paraded for the first time today, with Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster awarding them military flags. The flags were painted with swastikas and surrounded by Danzig's skull insignia. The army consisted of 1,500 men, had the appearance of a well-trained army, and carried new-style rifles, machine guns, and direct-fire guns. They paraded to the Great School Field. Forster gave a short speech, saying that in the past twenty years, Danzig had no army or fort of its own. The treaty now stipulates that if Danzig's own police force is insufficient, Danzig should be protected by Poland. Now Danzig is threatened by the country it relies on for protection, so it has to establish an army to protect itself. Danzig now has the newest army equipped with the latest weapons. In the current threatening situation, what the Danzig leader is doing is only what any national leader is forced to do. The mere words of the treaty or constitution are no longer applicable. The only thing that suits the actual situation is the willingness of 400,000 people to save themselves. Forster concluded by saying, "You have been called up to defend the beautiful ancient city of Danzig, to resist possible Polish attacks from inside and outside." The commander of the army gave a reply after receiving the flag, saying, "We would rather die in battle than be Polish." (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Polish-Danzig Negotiations in a Stalemate</h3>
<p>Danzig: Polish Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, one of the German leaders of Danzig, Greiser, and League of Nations Commissioner to Danzig, Burckhardt, held a meeting today. It is heard that in addition to the customs issue, the status of Danzig was also discussed. It is said that negotiations on the latter issue have reached a stalemate. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Danzig: Yesterday, Danzig officials wore the uniform of the border police for the first time, appearing on the Danzig border. The only difference was that the swastika insignia was surrounded by a skull. These people are now stationed on the border to inspect passports. In the past, this task was performed by ordinary customs officials or Danzig plainclothes police. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Germany's War Preparations Madness: Purchasing Large Quantities of Raw Materials from the London Market</h3>
<p>London: Many newspapers have said that Germany has recently purchased large quantities of raw materials in the market here. The "News Chronicle" reported that the country's procurement personnel are willing to make transactions with merchants at high prices. In the case of copper, as of today, 10,000 tons have been purchased in a week, of which 3,000 tons were purchased yesterday. When the market opened, the price was £44 per ton, and by the time the market closed, it had risen to £44 18 shillings and 9 pence. In the case of rubber, the country has also purchased more than 17,000 tons this month, more than doubling its usual monthly needs. 4,000 tons were purchased yesterday, and the price of rubber immediately rose to £8 15 shillings per ton, an increase of 3 shillings and 16 pence in one day. Government and economic figures here are concerned that Germany's actions are sufficient to prove that the country is actively preparing for war politically, and that these raw materials can also be purchased by the British government in wartime. Now that large quantities have been sold to Germany, the inventory here will inevitably be greatly reduced. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>British and French Delegations Visit Large-Scale Soviet Air Force Exercises, Disputes Arise in Talks Between Three Countries' Staff, Soviet Statement Unrelated to Far East Issues</h3>
<p>Moscow: A message was published in the Polish newspaper "Polska Gazeta," the "Polish Express," and the "Warsaw Post" these days, claiming that in the Soviet military talks with Britain and France currently underway in Moscow, disputes arose because the Soviet Union demanded that Britain and France provide assistance in the event of a war in the Far East. TASS is hereby ordered to declare that the above message is pure fabrication. There are indeed points of contention between the two sides in the resolution of these negotiations, but they relate to other issues and have nothing to do with the Far East issue. (TASS dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Yesterday was the Soviet Aviation Memorial Day. The staff talks between the Soviet Union, Britain, and France were suspended for one day to allow the three countries' delegations to visit the large-scale exercises held at the Tushino airfield near Moscow. There were 500 civil and military aircraft performing various complex flight and combat skills. More than 1.5 million people visited. This move by the Soviet Union has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it can impress the British and French delegations, and on the other hand, it can encourage ordinary Soviet youths to join aviation, so as to create a great reserve of pilots. As for the three countries' staff talks, the larger ones will continue to be held this morning. According to the new regulations, a four-hour meeting must be convened every day. The issues exchanged and the events agreed upon in these talks will not be announced. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The annual Soviet Aviation Day celebration was held today at the Tushino airfield outside Moscow. Hundreds of thousands of Moscow residents visited the site to watch their country's air force and pilots perform their divine might. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Zhdanov, Malenkov, Beria, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Shcherbakov, Badaev, and Rodionov, all the dignitaries attended in person. In addition, there were many guests including members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Soviet heroes, representatives of factories in Moscow, scientists, writers, artists, and members of the diplomatic corps, British and French military representatives, domestic and foreign journalists, etc. The celebration began at 3:00 p.m. First, there was a large review of hundreds of air defense and aviation association training aircraft and sports aircraft, all driven by members of various aviation clubs who were amateur flight learners, such as engineers, technicians, workers, office workers, and housewives. Among them, two teams of training aircraft driven by women performed stunts. Secondly, there was a review of the glider team. At that time, an aircraft towing eleven gliders in a sky train was discovered in the air, and the audience applauded thunderously. Then, two large teams of gliders performed aerobatics, and their skills were exceptionally outstanding. There was also a wonderful exercise by the air force. At the opening, Captain Sholokhov drove a high-speed fighter plane to perform various stunts for several minutes. Captain Koshevoy drove another type of fighter plane to follow, and his skills were also comparable. Then, two fighter planes took off to simulate combat, driven by Colonel Katichayev and Major Golovnya. After the battle, five red-wing fighter planes flew low over the field at the same time to perform a group stunt. Then, a team of bombers appeared under the cover of fighter planes, attacking the factory and aircraft models on the edge of the field. At that time, anti-aircraft guns fired simultaneously in the field, and fighter planes also took off to fight back, and the scene was extremely moving. After this scene was over, many high-speed aircraft of various types flew to the sky over the field, and the audience suddenly saw many marines parachuting down from the air, all impartial and safe landing in the center of the airport. The entire audience expressed extreme admiration for this outstanding skill. The last scene was when Soviet hero Gromov drove the newly completed giant aircraft "USSR L-670" leading a team of airships to fly across the sky over the field. Throughout the entire exercise, the atmosphere was tense and the audience was extremely excited. (TASS dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Foreign Minister Visits Italian Prime Minister, Hungary's Joining Not Impossible, Ciano Flies to Albania's Capital</h3>
<p>Rome: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky flew to a city in northern Italy for a vacation this morning, and is scheduled to stay there until the 21st. Foreign Minister Ciano flew to the Albanian capital this morning, and will hold a foundation stone laying ceremony for various public utilities offices there. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this morning, lasting for three hours. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. The content of the talks has not been ascertained. According to sources in the Hungarian embassy here, Foreign Minister Csáky was warmly welcomed by the Germans during his visit to Germany and was deeply impressed. As for the rumors that Germany has put pressure on Hungary to induce it to change its policies and take consistent action with the Axis countries, Foreign Minister Csáky laughed it off. The spokesperson went on to say that Foreign Minister Csáky's visit to Rome was due to the tense European situation and to take the opportunity to establish direct contact with Italian politicians. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Budapest: Although the Hungarian newspapers have tried their best to publish news of Foreign Minister Csáky's visits to Germany and Italy, they have not commented on it. Government officials are also quite vague. Political figures have said that the Hungarian view of the European situation has been repeatedly explained by Regent Horthy and Prime Minister Teleki. In short, Hungary is willing to cooperate in friendship with Germany, Italy, and Poland, and to improve relations with other countries, but is unwilling to accept any restrictions that would harm its freedom and independence. Someone said that Hungary's joining the military alliance between Germany and Italy is not impossible, but it may not be realized before Foreign Minister Csáky returns home. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the reports in British and French newspapers that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky had previously visited German leader Hitler and presented a "22-point agreement," the semi-official German News Agency has solemnly denied it. According to British and French newspapers, Germany pressured Hungary in the form of an ultimatum to conclude a friendship treaty and military alliance, and at the same time suggested a customs and monetary union, etc. The German News Agency said that Western European public opinion is too credulous to believe in rumors.

<h3>Japanese Shipyard Breaches Contract, Refuses to Deliver Ships, Soviet Union Protests</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs recently issued a reply to a memorandum from Japan, stating that the Japanese government is suspected of condoning and shielding the illegal actions of the Japanese Matsuo Shipyard in failing to deliver ships ordered by the Soviet Union and refusing to return the deposit of 1,647,750 Japanese yen. The Japanese government should bear full responsibility for the Japanese shipyard and its guarantor's breach of contract. (TASS dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Credit Loan to China, To Be Used to Purchase Machinery, Agreement Said to Be Signed Yesterday</h3>
<p>London: According to news from here today, the £3 million loan from Britain to China is to be used for China to purchase British machinery, such as various machines for manufacturing munitions or arsenals, and machines for manufacturing aircraft. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>London: Although news of the signing of the £3 million export credit loan agreement has not been confirmed by British and Chinese officials, reliable sources insist that the agreement was signed in London today. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>London: Financial circles in London issued a message today stating that the British government has delayed approving the £3 million export credit loan to China because it fears that this move will further fuel anti-British movements in Japan. During the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita stated that Britain must fulfill the principles of this negotiation and cease all economic assistance to China. A British government spokesperson stated at the end of this week that Britain had already signed an export credit loan agreement with China. Bankers here expect that if the Tokyo talks fail, the British government will use the export credit loan to China as a final move. Sources say that in this credit loan agreement, Britain will supply China with machinery for manufacturing munitions, military supplies, and aircraft. British banking circles said last night that the Bank of England has expressed doubts about this credit loan. Furthermore, according to unconfirmed reports, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie reported to the Foreign Office that this credit loan to China would not affect Japan's attitude toward Britain. The Chinese side is very anxious about the delayed signing of this loan, as the full text of the agreement was drafted several weeks ago. The British Cabinet currently considers the crisis in the European war as the primary issue and is unwilling to take further risks in the Far East. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>US Asiatic Fleet, Well-Equipped, Remarks by Yarnell</h3>
<p>San Francisco, USA: Rear Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, returned here today aboard the President Coolidge. When asked about the situation in the Far East, he replied, "The future is unpredictable. Over the past two years, several unexpected incidents, all caused by the Japanese military, have affected American interests. The sinking of the Panay is just one link in the chain. However, the strength of the US Asiatic Fleet does not need to be expanded. Our fleet has a total of thirty-five warships and six thousand officers and men." It is noted that Rear Admiral Yarnell is known among Americans for his deep understanding of Far Eastern affairs. Congress has awarded him the "Meritorious Service" medal for his outstanding achievements during his tenure. He will soon go to Washington to receive the medal and meet with President Roosevelt to report on the situation in the Far East. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Activities of Japanese and Puppet Forces in Various Parts of Guangdong Province, Zhongshan and Xinhui Continually Violated, Most of the Japanese Troops in Shunde Withdraw</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondent: After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou and its subordinate areas in Guangdong Province, they implemented a policy of using Chinese to control Chinese, using puppet organizations as accomplices, resulting in extreme chaos in the area. The recent activities of Japanese and puppet forces are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Zhongshan</p>
<p>The post-war work in the recovered area of ​​Zhonghengmen was just completed. On the 9th, Japanese warships launched a large-scale attack on Dieshi in the 3rd district and Guzhen in the 9th district, attempting to send troops to land, which made the situation in Zhongshan tense again. It was found that at about 9:00 a.m. on the 9th, six Japanese gunboats, two transport ships, thirty-four armed fishing boats, and several rubber boats loaded with Japanese soldiers sailed from the outer sea of ​​Jiangmen in the rain to the Hengmen sea, and attacked Zhongshan in two ways: One way bombed Gu Zhen in the 9th district, and the other way bombed the Dieshi and Quanlu areas in the 3rd district. As soon as the merchants and people in Shiqi heard the artillery fire, they fled. Wu Fei, commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Area, immediately ordered the local teams to be on strict alert after receiving the report. However, because the Japanese warships were too far away, they did not return fire. Japanese warships fired dozens of shots. At about 11 o'clock, the Japanese planes were unable to come out to help due to heavy rain, and the Japanese boats did not dare to approach the shore, so they temporarily stopped firing. However, the Japanese warships and boats still berthed in the Heng River. At 12:00 noon, they continued to fire artillery and bombard Dieshi and Quanlu. The Chinese army was still preparing for the attack and successively sent troops to increase their defense. Japanese warships fired more than a hundred shots in a row. At about 4:00 in the evening, the sky was still not clear, and the Japanese warships sailed back to Jiangmen, but four gunboats and four rubber boats were left moored in the Yinzhou Lake, and they fired randomly at Muzhou and Xinsha in Xinhui. On that day, Japanese warships fired more than two hundred shots, and many houses were destroyed and dozens of people were killed or injured in Dieshi, Quanlu, Gu Zhen, and Muzhou. There were also shells near Shiqi. One shell fell on the sea, destroying a banana boat, killing one person and injuring two others. Afterwards, Wu Fei, commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Area, specially issued a letter to all guerrilla teams in the area, expressing his condolences to the anti-Japanese war in Hengmen, and encouraged all officers and soldiers to continue to fight bravely. Because Zhongshan is located near the ocean, the Japanese may invade again at any time, so they should fulfill their duty to defend the land and strengthen their vigilance. If the Japanese army dares to invade again, they will give them a bigger blow. At the same time, he also issued letters to the chiefs of townships, towns, villages, paos, jias, and all the people of the county, expressing his appreciation to the people of the fourth district of Zhongshan for their enthusiastic assistance in the team's resistance against Japan, and called on all the people of the county to mobilize to form a united front with the team to strengthen the anti-Japanese forces and defend their homeland.</p>
<p>Sanshui</p>
<p>The Zhang mansion on Xinan Litong Street in Sanshui County was occupied by Morita, an officer of the Japanese army stationed there. At 6:00 a.m. on the 1st of this month, a bomb was found on the right side of the staircase of the house. Before it could be moved, it exploded loudly. The stairs and board walls caught fire on the spot and burned fiercely. Japanese soldiers and workers in the house scrambled to rescue, but the fire was so fierce that they could not put it out. Japanese officer Morita and his wife, Katsuyama Kaoru, panicked and jumped out of the window, falling and seriously injured. Morita broke his left hand and right foot, while Katsuyama Kaoru broke her right foot and suffered a shock to her abdomen, which may endanger her life.</p>
<p>Xinhui</p>
<p>The Jianghui war has been going on and off. Chinese and Japanese armies have been confronting each other in strict formation in recent days. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Japanese army in Huicheng built more than a dozen artillery positions on Guifeng Mountain and Xiangshan Mountain to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking Huicheng. Most of the heavy equipment and supplies were also transported to the two mountains for storage. A certain mechanical unit of the Gui Army stationed on Xinhe Road in the Chinese side moved to a certain place early in the morning of the 7th and fired artillery at the Japanese army's position there. The Japanese army also fired artillery to resist stubbornly, and a fierce artillery battle broke out between the two sides. It lasted from about 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., when it stopped. The rumbling sound shook the mountains and could be clearly heard in Daze and Niuwan. At 7:30 a.m. on the 8th, more than 200 Japanese and puppet troops in Huicheng invaded Mani and Shuchakeng. The villagers immediately beat gongs to warn them, and three or four hundred villagers armed with weapons gathered outside the village to intercept the Japanese and puppet troops, and a fierce battle broke out. The Japanese and puppet troops came fiercely and rushed in twice, but the villagers fought bravely to resist. At about 9:00, the Japanese and puppet troops retreated to Huicheng when they saw that they could not succeed. When the Japanese and puppet troops invaded, the Japanese army in Huicheng also fired artillery to cover them, so many houses in the villages were destroyed. At present, the Japanese army in Jianghui is recruiting rascals and gangsters to expand and compile the "puppet pacification army" to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking because of their weak strength. Those who have been compiled have more than a hundred people. However, the puppet pacification army is a rabble and cannot withstand a single blow. In addition, Japanese warships have been harassing Muzhou in Xinhui County for days. On the afternoon of the 9th, Japanese warships fired more than 30 shots at Muzhou and Xinsha. At 5:00, they retreated to Jiangmen. At about 8:00 a.m. on the 10th, six Japanese warships, armed fishing boats and thirty or forty rubber boats sailed from the outer sea to Yinzhou Lake and fired artillery at Muzhou. The local team fought back with local cannons. The sound of artillery was extremely fierce. At about 10 o'clock, the sound of artillery in Muzhou gradually subsided. On the morning of the 13th, three Japanese warships and several rubber boats sailed from overseas into the Zhongxin border to spy on Muzhou and Aosha. The Chinese army immediately strengthened its coastal defense forces and waited in strict formation.</p>
<p>Shunde</p>
<p>The Chinese guerrillas in Shunde County have been very active recently. They have launched attacks on Japanese camps in Daliang, Rongqi, Chencun, and Guizhou, and have gained a lot. The Japanese army stationed in Ronggui has destroyed the nearby bridges, increased the number of artillery troops to defend, and at the same time, most of the Japanese troops originally stationed in Chencun have suddenly withdrawn, and the defense is now the responsibility of the puppet army. On the evening of the 4th of this month, a certain unit of the Chinese guerrillas attacked the Japanese army. At about 12 o'clock, they confronted the Japanese army in the southern suburbs of Chencun. The guerrillas fought bravely and wiped out more than 30 Japanese soldiers. Then more than 100 Japanese soldiers from the nearby Lintou Japanese camp rushed to reinforce. The guerrillas retreated when they saw the opportunity. Unexpectedly, in the dark night, the Japanese army that came to reinforce mistakenly thought that the Japanese and puppet troops were the Chinese guerrillas and fired fiercely. The two sides came into contact. After holding each other for twenty minutes, they realized the misunderstanding, but more than a dozen people had been killed or injured. When the guerrillas retreated, they turned to Chencun Houyong and intercepted two Japanese military grain boats. As for Daliang, the county seat, since it was occupied, the Japanese and puppet troops have been extremely fierce, opening up smoke gambling. The traitors and puppet police often have disputes over rights because they collect gambling money. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, seven puppet soldiers were collecting protection fees at the Leli Pai Jiu Hall on Huancheng Road. At that time, the puppet self-police team also came to collect fees, so a dispute arose, followed by a conflict. The puppet soldiers were defeated and fled in embarrassment. Then more than 30 soldiers from the army came to make trouble again, and the puppet self-police team also showed no weakness, summoned more than 20 members of the party, and resisted. The two sides then fought each other. For a time, gunshots were heard, and shops and residents in the city closed their doors and fled, and the order was in chaos. The puppet self-police team was outnumbered and suffered a total of five deaths and injuries before fleeing. It was heard that the puppet army also had casualties. Also, on the 7th, at night, the Chinese army in Guizhou fired artillery at the Japanese and puppet troops in Nantou, firing dozens of shots and destroying many houses. When the Japanese army in Daliang City heard the news, most of them were transferred to the suburbs to defend, and the situation seemed very panic. In addition, the Japanese army in Longjiang recently sent dozens of Japanese soldiers, with five soldiers in a team, to various villages nearby to be responsible for the so-called reorganization and training of the puppet self-police teams in various villages. On the 31st of last month, five Japanese soldiers went to Guisha Township near Longjiang. When they arrived, they immediately ordered all the puppet self-police teams in the township to gather, but one of them happened to go to the fields to work and did not arrive at the gathering. The Japanese army pointed out that they were defying orders and beat them severely, which aroused public anger. The puppet self-police teams rushed forward and surrounded and killed the five Japanese soldiers. So far, no Japanese troops have come to harass the township.</p>
<h3>Accompanying Records of Fengxian Situation, Wu Jiaqiao First Suffered Fire Damage, Qingcun Port Was Also Burned to Ashes</h3>
<p>Punan Correspondent: Since the Japanese army occupied Nanqiao, they have paid great attention to defense because they were afraid of guerrilla attacks. Iron gates were installed at each intersection, and steel guns were erected. No one was allowed to enter or leave without a pass. Recently, citizen registration was held and citizen certificates were reissued with strict restrictions. The puppet maintenance association was originally headed by Qian, but Qian resigned because it was not easy to deal with the environment. The Japanese propaganda class then asked Zhu, a puppet section chief from Shanghai, to take over the office. The guerrillas had already disintegrated into smaller units and hid in the four villages. In the past two months, they had contacted the Japanese army more than a dozen times, big and small. The Japanese side felt quite uneasy about this, and specially transferred more than a thousand Japanese and puppet troops last week in order to defend it for a long time. The Xi Township established a military station in Xiaotang Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway. It is said that the Japanese will open a puppet people's training class and a puppet primary school in the town. A few days ago, the Japanese army patrolled westward from the town and contacted the guerrillas in Wujiaqiao. They set fire to part of the town's houses. The Japanese army used Qingcun Port as a military station in the eastern township. On the 17th, they sent a team to go there. When they found traces of guerrillas in the town, they copied out items stored in Yu's residence and immediately set fire. Fortunately, the wind was not strong and it was extinguished early before it spread. The essence of the town was destroyed by the Japanese army when they passed by last spring. Now it has been robbed again and has become a dead market.</p>
<p>Zhelin Qianjiaqiao, Qicundun, Pingan Lake, and other places where the salt factories are located are all general areas for tax evasion revenue. The Japanese army tried to seize them repeatedly, but they failed to control them due to the activities of the guerrillas. At present, only Zhelin is being stationed and collected by the team. It is heard that due to the abnormal weather this summer and the fact that most of the salt people have fled outside, the salt slabs have been abandoned and there is little production. Therefore, although May, June, and July are busy months, the income is still minimal.</p>
<p>In terms of Fengxian's administration, the provincial government has long assigned a county magistrate to handle affairs as usual. In terms of military affairs, the eastern townships are under the jurisdiction of Yu Taosheng, the magistrate of Nanhui County of the Second Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. Therefore, local affairs are often urged by the Nanhui County Government nearby. Tai Ri Bridge, Zhoujia Lane, Touqiao, and other places were originally garrisoned by the Third Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. After the resignation of Li Zhiming, the captain of the detachment, they were also incorporated into the Second Detachment and entrusted to Gu Shouxin. The western townships west of Qingcun and Xuliqiao are entirely under the control of the Eighth Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, and their defense area reaches Yexie Caojing in Songjiang County and Jinshanwei and Shanyang in Jinshan County. Because the area is strategically important, it has more contact with the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Nantong Guerrillas, Killed Japanese Sentry, And Seized a Rifle</h3>
<p>Nantong Correspondent: The ×× Brigade organized by Nantong workers, led by intelligence director ×××, went to Tangjiazhai on the afternoon of the 8th of this month with four soldiers, each hiding a pistol, to attack the Japanese army. When passing the Dayangqiao entrance west of the Tangzha River, the soldiers pretended to bow to the Japanese sentry, and then took advantage of the Japanese soldiers' unpreparedness and shot and killed them with pistols, and seized a Japanese Type 38 rifle, and returned to the team safely. Afterwards, the Japanese army stationed in Tangzha searched all the shops, and it was heard that they were all looted.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Western Shanghai Was Serious Last Night, Conflict Between Puppet Police and Detective Police, Western Detective Chief Jin Shiluk Was Shot and Wounded, Four Puppet Police Were Shot Down, Two Were Injured and Two Were Killed, Security Was Tightened in the Avenue Joffre Area</h3>
<p>After a series of cases related to public security occurred near the boundary of Western Shanghai, the police authorities of the police station have paid close attention to it and taken strict precautions. At the same time, the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which is in charge, has dispatched police cars and armed detective police to patrol the area constantly to maintain law and order. At about 5:00 p.m. yesterday, a police car was ordered to drive to the border area of ​​the concession to inspect. At that time, the police car first went to Connaught Road, and then along the road to the west, searching any suspicious people and vehicles.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Detectives, Invade the Concession</p>
<p>When it was close to 6:00, the police car and detectives had turned into Avenue Joffre, and were about to reach the vicinity of Xinkangli. They saw more than ten puppet policemen and plainclothes men resembling puppet detectives, holding weapons, striding on Avenue Joffre in the jurisdiction of the concession. The police detectives of the police station thought that these people did not know the boundary, so they stopped the car and went forward to explain and persuade them to withdraw.</p>
<p>Ordered to Withdraw, Resistance with Guns</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, more than ten people ignored them, and even threatened to resist with the weapons they held. While they were holding each other, Jin Luke (Kin Look), the Western Detective Chief on the police car, also came forward to persuade them, but they still ignored him, and even threatened to make trouble. The Western Detective Chief turned around and prepared to report to the police station by telephone. Unexpectedly, these people took the lead in firing guns and shooting at Jin, and the bullet entered from the back.</p>
<p>Both Sides Fought, Bullets Rained Down</p>
<p>But Jin was a hundred times more courageous. Although he was seriously injured, he was still able to stand firm and urgently directed the detectives to prepare. But at this time, the puppet police and others shot their guns and bullets at the police car, as dense as a string of beads, so the machine guns prepared on the police car were also fired, and it was like entering a battlefield.</p>
<p>A Squad of British Troops, Rushed to Suppress</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene after receiving Jin's report. The British Defense Force Headquarters in the area also received a report of the incident, and at the same time assigned a squad of British troops to suppress it, and immediately blocked traffic in the Avenue Joffre area.</p>
<p>The Injured Detective Chief, Was Sent to the Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation was expanding and seeing that four of their partners had been arrested and shot down, the puppet police and others were inevitably flustered and fled out of the boundary. Jin also waited until a large number of detectives arrived before realizing that he was injured and fell to the ground. The detectives helped him into the car and sent him for treatment.</p>
<p>Four Puppet Police, Two Dead and Two Injured</p>
<p>Two of the four puppet policemen who had been shot down had already died, and two were injured. After interrogation, it was confirmed that one was Ni Liangen, 41 years old, who was shot in the knee, and the other was Zhao Faqing, 44 years old, who was shot in the abdomen and legs. They are now being treated in the hospital first.</p>
<p>A Passerby, Was Shot and Injured</p>
<p>In addition, there was also a passerby named Zhu Changrong (23 years old), who was also shot and injured in the leg. Because it was necessary to investigate, he was also sent to the Public Concession Hospital. After the incident, the situation there was still very serious. The British army was on guard and had not withdrawn, and the nearby inspection work had not stopped.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals Inspect Various Coastal Provinces, Excellent Impressions</h3>
<p>A foreign national recently inspected Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces and returned to Shanghai. According to his talk, after the coastal blockade, the price of foreign goods has risen slightly, the price of local goods is cheap, and the food supply has been adequately adjusted by the authorities, and there is no shortage. Although planes are constantly bombing various places, the people are accustomed to it, and their patriotic feelings are extremely high. They all understand the meaning of resisting Japan and saving the country, and the people's sentiments are very different from the past. Their transportation mechanism is complete, many new roads have been opened, and the opening time is quite accurate, which is beyond expectations. The future is truly unlimited.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Minister Returns Home This Morning</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post stated that the Norwegian Minister to China, Japan, and Siam, Colonel, recently arrived in Shanghai with his wife and is scheduled to return to his country by boat tomorrow (20th).</p>
<h3>After the Black Market Foreign Exchange Contracted Sharply, Import Surplus Has Indeed Decreased Sharply, Although the Shanghai Customs Has Not Complied with the Import Prohibition Order, Exports Have Increased Sharply After Foreign Exchange Tightening</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs' import and export trade statistics for July show that the value of imported foreign goods was 59,011,6344 yuan in national currency, and the value of exported local goods was 42,117,185 yuan in national currency, resulting in an import surplus of 16,900,9159 yuan. From January to July, the total value of imports was 282,108,1359 yuan in national currency, and the total value of exports was 214,531,909 yuan in national currency. Although the Jianghai Customs in the occupied area did not comply with the measures to prohibit the import of goods promulgated by the Ministry of Finance due to the special circumstances, the import of goods was greatly affected due to the sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange. Therefore, the import of foreign goods in July decreased sharply. For example, the import in May this year was 73,512,896 yuan, and the export was 34,454,784 yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 39,058,112 yuan. The import in June was 67,737,500 yuan, and the export was 25,681,341 yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 42,056,159 yuan. Compared with July, the import of goods has decreased and the export of goods has increased, and the overall import surplus has decreased sharply.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Maintain Food Supply for the People, Focusing on Unblocking Sources, Mr. Yu Qiaqing Ordered Tribute Rice to Relieve Difficulties, Commercial Bank Does Not Engage in Rice Business</h3>
<p>The rice market has been closed for two days. Most of the rice sold by rice shops in recent days is rice that has been hoarded by hoarders for a long time. There are both superior white and Ke Xian rice, but Ke Xian rice is the most. According to the rice color observed by the rice industry, it has been hoarded for a long time and recently sold. As for the future of rice prices, it mainly depends on whether inland transportation is convenient or not.</p>
<p>Commercial Bank, Does Not Engage in Rice Business</p>
<p>The warehouses of commercial banks in the city have always been engaged in the business of storing goods, and grain is also one of the goods. Therefore, it is inevitable that the food is stored in the warehouses. The authorities of the concession once conducted a strict investigation of the amount of rice stored and the names of the owners in the warehouses of the banks. The banks reported the truth, which proves that the banks themselves do not engage in the rice business, which is very clear. The rumors about the commercial banks hoarding rice are not true. In the current situation, food rice is necessary for the people's livelihood, and it is not the same as other goods. Banks themselves specialize in legitimate business and do not engage in hoarding rice.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Ordered Rice to Relieve Difficulties</p>
<p>It is heard that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, in view of the seriousness of the food situation in Shanghai and the lack of good measures by the authorities for a while, there are more than 80,000 refugees in the boundary, and problems have arisen in the supply of food. Therefore, he joined forces with various groups and enthusiastic people to raise funds to order Saigon rice for relief. There are a total of 18,000 bags of Saigon rice, including 10,000 bags under the name of the Refugee Relief Association and 8,000 bags under the names of various groups, which will arrive in Shanghai on September 2nd. There is a saying that 8,000 bags of them will be sold at a fair price.</p>
<p>The Authorities Focus, On Unblocking Sources</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions are still paying attention to unblocking the sources to maintain food supply for the people, and there is no intention to order foreign rice. According to foreign reports, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities are discussing facilitating the transportation of food rice to Shanghai, which is currently underway. As for the rumor that the Shanghai Municipal Council has ordered Saigon foreign rice, it is not true. According to the information obtained in this morning's investigation, it is not easy to transport rice to Shanghai recently.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Railway, Resumed Traffic, Highway Still Difficult to Pass</h3>
<p>The section of the Vietnamese National Railway from Hanoi to Dongdang was washed away by mountain torrents, destroying more than 11 kilometers of roadbed, so that vehicles could not pass. The details were once recorded in this newspaper. Now we have received a communication from Haiphong that the roadbed has been urgently repaired by the engineering department and was completely completed on the 8th of this month. All passenger and freight transportation has resumed, and everything is as usual. As for the highway in that section, it is still difficult to pass for the time being.</p>
<h3>Obstruction Occurred, Sailing Delayed Several Hours, Return to Europe Time Unchanged</h3>

It is now learned that the North German Company's express mail ship, "Hohos Duster," managed by the American Most Time Foreign Firm, departed from Europe for Shanghai on the 13th of this month, heading to Kobe and Yokohama, Japan, etc., according to the</p>
<p>Scheduled Route</p>
<p>It was supposed to arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 AM today and set sail at 11:00 AM tomorrow, returning to Bremen, Germany. The last passenger tender was scheduled to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 9:00 AM this morning. However, it is now learned that when the ship set sail from Kobe, the machinery suddenly</p>
<p>Experienced Obstruction</p>
<p>It was immediately repaired, but the sailing schedule has been delayed for several hours, so the arrival time in Shanghai must be postponed until 4:00 PM before it can enter the port and dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will take the tender, arriving at the New Customs Wharf at 6:00 PM. As for the</p>
<p>Return to Europe Time</p>

<h3>Fractional Currency Notes to be Issued Day After Tomorrow, Universally Accepted in Shanghai, Tobacco Exchange Industry Yesterday Sent Letter Requesting Group Exchange, Substitute Currency Stamps Eagerly Awaiting Flexible Recall</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Central Bank, by order of the Ministry of Finance, is issuing fractional currency notes of 1 fen and 5 fen denominations, with an initial batch of 500,000 yuan. The Yongning Company has completed the printing, and the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank will issue them. Yesterday, inquiries at the bank revealed that the fractional currency notes will be issued the day after tomorrow (Tuesday). The bank will issue a public announcement at that time to inform the public. The method will be the same as the issuance of subsidiary currency notes, with legal tender as full backing.</p>
<p>Tobacco Exchange Industry Requests Exchange for New Notes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association, considering the imminent issuance of new notes by the Central Bank, and planning to set the quotas for each industry to exchange for new notes, in order to prepare for business needs and alleviate the difficulties of its members, specifically sent a letter to the Central Bank yesterday, requesting permission for group exchanges. The general idea of ​​the letter is roughly as follows: "Our members number more than 2,000, of which more than 100 are members of the industry association (ie, large firms). When your bank issued copper subsidiary currency, we entrusted the association to be responsible for handling and distributing the matter on your behalf, seeking equality. Now that the new notes have been transported to Shanghai and are ready to be issued, our association members, numbering more than 100, would like to request your bank to allow each to receive 200 yuan of fractional currency notes, so that they can be used for business purposes and can be distributed to various colleagues (small firms) at any time, so as to make full use of them and circulate them in the market."</p>
<p>Various Substitute Currencies Can Be Recalled Immediately</p>
<p>The substitute currency notes issued by the Public Concession and French Concession tram and automobile companies are very large in number, and some are circulating in the business community. According to inquiries from various relevant parties yesterday, the currency of the two concession tram and automobile companies began circulating when copper coins were in short supply. The original intention was for business needs. Now that the Central Bank has 500,000 yuan of new notes ready to be issued, after the Central Bank's notes circulate in the market, the substitute currency notes can be completely recalled and invalidated.</p>
<p>All Sectors Eagerly Awaiting Recall of Stamps</p>
<p>According to further inquiries by reporters from the Daguan News Agency, the biggest recipients of this 400,000 yuan stamp problem are generally poor traders and vendors, followed by small businesses and stalls. Currently, rumors are circulating that stamps will be discontinued and cannot be exchanged for cash, causing extreme panic among these merchants. As a result, they are arbitrarily seeking to exchange them for cash at low prices. Until yesterday, some were even seeking to exchange 130 or 140 stamps for one yuan of legal tender. This is a matter of great and far-reaching concern to the livelihoods of laborers. It is hoped that the postal authorities can deal with this issue flexibly and recall them as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Coal Prices are Expensive, Affecting Industry, Demand for Coal Dust is Extremely Large, Impacting Production Costs of Related Factories</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Jianghai Customs, from January to June of this year, the quantity of imported coal blocks was 133,727 tons, with a value of 5,452,540 gold, equivalent to 13,066,789 yuan. After the source of national coal was cut off, coal merchants ordered huge quantities of foreign coal from coal-producing areas such as Annam, Taiwan, India, and Australia to be shipped to Shanghai for sale. The market is open from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM every day, with more than 300 participating firms. Previously, there was an evaluation committee for the coal market, but it was dissolved after the war. Market prices are all determined by each firm based on the cost of shipping and commission. At first, the order was orderly, as in the past, but after the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market, the prices of foreign coal were high, and coal prices in the market soared. Various industries have also felt that the expenditure on purchasing fuel is too large. It is heard that the coal industry, due to the special environment in Shanghai, is thoroughly investigating whether there is any other coal mixed into the goods for dumping.</p>
<h3>Izumo Ship Moves Berth, Said to Prevent Arson, Zhaoshang Wharf Storing Large Amounts of Military Equipment, Strange Fires Occurring Frequently in Hongkou Recently</h3>
<p>The Japanese naval flagship Izumo has been berthed at the Mitsubishi Wharf, a Japanese merchant in Hongkou, north of the Suzhou River estuary. This was decided after returning to Shanghai from patrolling the Yangtze River and remaining in its original location. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, it suddenly changed its berth to the Zhaoshang Middle Wharf on the east side. Outsiders are unaware of the truth and have made many speculations. According to someone from Hongkou, this move is purely to prevent the so-called "arson group." The reason is that the Zhaoshang Middle Wharf was occupied after the Shanghai war and used as a major base for storing military equipment. This is still the case today. Recently, strange fires have been occurring frequently in Hongkou. It is suspected that the arson group is coming from Pudong, taking boats along the waterway and taking the opportunity to land on the Bund in Hongkou. It is feared that the ammunition depot at the wharf is not adequately guarded and that people may cross the Huangpu River, go to the wharf, and commit arson. This is considered extremely serious, so the Izumo ship was moved to the wharf to prevent "arsonists" from Pudong.</p>
<h3>US Transportation Experts Arrive in China to Adjust Highway Military Transport, Experts Will Be Responsible for Adjusting and Handling Matters of Maintaining Smooth Freight Transport</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, US Treasury Counselor to Shanghai, Mr. Nicholson, departed for Hong Kong yesterday (the 18th) to meet with three US transportation experts who are scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong this week by clipper ship, to reorganize the</p>
<p>Chinese Transportation</p>
<p>affairs along the Burma and Vietnamese highways. The three are Sheehan, Vice President of the Chicago Casein Transportation Company, as well as Mr. Barry and Mr. Butter, all of whom are known as leaders in the transportation industry. This decision was made by US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to resolve the less-than-smooth automobile freight situation,</p>
<p>This Situation</p>
<p>that is causing important supplies to be blocked on the road from Chongqing to the sea. The United States' assistance to Chinese transportation is in response to a request from the Ministry of Communications of Chongqing. Washington received this request and immediately began investigating, selecting these three Chicago personnel. They will serve as</p>
<p>Advisors to the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>The Central Government announced on August 10 the establishment of a Highway Transportation Bureau, with general offices in the southwest and northwest, to manage highway engineering and related matters. According to recent reports from the mainland, transportation in Haiphong, Vietnam, is quite congested. Trucks driving to Chongqing seem to lack coordination, and there is often a phenomenon of trucks</p>
<p>Unloading in Chongqing</p>
<p>and then returning empty for thousands of miles. The main task of the transportation experts is to solve this problem, and how to keep highways open in all kinds of weather. This engineering problem is also the work of the experts.</p>
<h3>Freight Rates on Shanghai-Ningbo Line Increased by Another 50 Percent, Three Price Increases Totaling a Doubling, Passenger Ticket Prices to be Revised from the 25th</h3>
<p>Since permission was granted to anchor outside Zhenhai Port and resume navigation on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, ships have successively resumed sailing. Initially, due to restrictions on the entry and exit of goods and passengers by the authorities, business was slack. Recently, the authorities have understood and relaxed the restrictions slightly, so shipping has slightly improved. However, there is a shortage of barges in Zhenhai, which takes a lot of time to load and unload goods, and the sailing schedule is delayed for a long time, resulting in huge losses for the company. In order to compensate for the above losses, the companies have</p>
<p>Increased Prices Repeatedly. From the day before yesterday (the 18th), freight rates were increased by another 50 percent, calculated based on the freight rates before June 22. Including the 25 percent increase on June 22 and the 25 percent increase on August 1, plus the 50 percent increase on the 18th of the previous day, the total increase is a doubling. For example, the freight rate for general cargo is 18 yuan per ton, and the new price is 36 yuan, plus the public welfare donation and barge fee of 50 percent, the total price per ton is</p>
<p>54 yuan, which is six times higher than the pre-war price, which is a considerable expense. The companies are very concerned about the safety of passengers getting on and off outside Zhenhai Port. Recently, they have agreed with the Tianbao Ship to undertake the connecting transportation between Duo Zhen, which has already been implemented. The passenger ticket prices have been agreed upon by the Zhongyi Company and the Lihe Foreign Firm and will be revised from the 25th. First class (large cabin) is 30 yuan, second class (official cabin) is 12 yuan, third class (room cabin) is 9 yuan, and general class is 4.5 yuan. However, the fares of the Far East Company are</p>
<p>Slightly different, with first class at 20 yuan, second class at 10 yuan, third class at 8 yuan, and general class at 5 yuan. Export of Hana was implemented yesterday. The Taikoo Yingzhou Ship only loads cargo and will not carry passengers for the time being. Although it has received the fare increase letters from Lihe and Zhongyi Companies, it has not yet been decided. The fare from Ningbo to Shanghai is slightly higher, with first class (large cabin) at 35 yuan, second class (official cabin) at 15 yuan, third class (room cabin) at 12 yuan, and general class at 5 yuan. There are currently</p>
<p>Six ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, including the Lihe Foreign Firm's Moufu Ship, the Zhongyi Company's Ende and Deping Ships, the Far East Company's Hana Ship, the Yihua Foreign Firm's Baoli Ship, and the Taikoo Company's Yingzhou Ship. As for the New Beijing Ship, it will not operate for the time being. Deping was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai today, but it is now learned that it will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon and set sail for Ningbo on the morning of the 22nd. Passengers must board the ship tomorrow night.</p>
<h3>Missionary Arrested in Xuzhou Has Been Released</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, it was learned yesterday (the 18th) that the two Canadian missionaries who were arrested by the Japanese authorities in Xuzhou on the 8th of this month have been released. It is understood that the two are pastors of the Canadian Jesuit Church in Xuzhou, and were arrested by the Japanese army on suspicion of being spies. Efforts by Jesuit personnel in Shanghai to contact the missionaries in Xuzhou have failed. Telegrams inquiring about their situation have not been answered, and the names of the two pastors have not been disclosed to the Jesuit Church or the British Consulate in this city.</p>
<h3>During High Tide Period, Frequent Flooding on Roads, May Return to Normal from the 22nd</h3>
<p>The high tide of the Huangpu River "must continue to rise until the 22nd before it can return to normal, so during the high tide period from today until the 21st (before dawn) and the afternoon tide (before 4:00 PM), low-lying roads will continue to be flooded with water." As for the weather in this city, it is still autumn hot.</p>
<h3>Detained US Steamer Released Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the English Greater American Evening News, the "American Eagle" steamer, belonging to the Shanghai Wharf Warehouse Company (translated as Xishi), a branch of the American President Lines in Shanghai, was detained by the Japanese army on Thursday afternoon. It is said that the steamer collided with a Japanese patrol boat in the Huangpu River before being detained. This matter has been reported to the US Consulate. The steamer is expected to be released this afternoon. One Chinese crew member was also detained by the Japanese army in Pudong, but the Japanese side has not yet stated what he has done wrong.</p>

<h3>Colluding with Servant, Stealing Employer's Guns and Ammunition, and Attempting to Strangle Servant to Silence Him, Suspect Arrested Yesterday and Turned Over to Court, Guns and Ammunition Recovered</h3>
<p>Qin Houxing, the servant of Englishman William Wellington, who lived in Room 4, Apartment 1, Alley 641, Xiafei Road, colluded with his friend Zhou Wenqing and others on the 16th of this month to steal two pistols, more than one hundred bullets, and a lighter shaped like a pistol from his employer. After obtaining the stolen goods, they went to Zhaofeng Garden together. Zhou and others suddenly had the idea of embezzling the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Fearing Qin Would Leak the Secret</p>
<p>They suddenly put a rope around Qin's neck in the garden, hoping to strangle him to death and silence him. After Qin cried for help, nearby British soldiers entered the enclosure and arrested Zhou Wenqing and Zhang A'er, who were escorted to the First Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the content of this case is extremely complicated. Over the past few days, Detective Xie Futang of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, in cooperation with Western detectives, has been investigating based on Qin Houxing's confession and the statements of the two defendants, Zhou and Zhang. The investigation has yielded some clues, and on the 18th,</p>
<p>Accomplices Continued to be Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Guoguang (also known as Chen Xiuquan) and Zhou Xiezhen (ie Qian Xizhen) from Changzhou were arrested. The original stolen guns and ammunition and a blood-stained short shirt were recovered from Room 303 of the Oriental Hotel. All four defendants arrested before and after were quickly escorted to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Meng opened a court to interrogate them. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the police's findings, stating that Zhou Wenqing and Zhou Xiezhen, among the defendants in this case, are</p>
<p>Brothers</p>
<p>They were originally named Qian, and Chen and Zhang were all friends of Qin Houxing. Between the 9th and 10th of this month, they agreed to wait for Qin's employer to leave his residence on the 16th before going to Qin's place. Qin stole the pistols, bullets, and lighter. Together with Chen Guoguang and Zhou Xiezhen, they took the stolen goods to the Lao Yutai Hotel on Yunnan Road and met A'gou and Ren Xiaorong. They handed over the stolen goods to Ren, who transferred them to A'gou, who took them to the Oriental Hotel to hide them in a room. They then went to Zhaofeng Garden to play. Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiao'er were also in the garden. Taking advantage of Qin Houxing's lack of preparation, they suddenly put a rope around Qin's neck.</p>
<p>Attempting to Strangle Him to Death</p>
<p>Then they would be able to silence him about the theft of the Westerner's guns and ammunition. According to the confession, this plan was devised by Ren Xiaorong. The police still need to continue the investigation, so please detain all the defendants, and so on. Detective Xie also presented the stolen goods recovered in the case for Judge Meng to inspect. After questioning the defendants, he ordered a postponement of the hearing, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>German Resident Kills Mistress: Defendant's Confession Shifts Blame, Investigation and Further Hearing Ordered</h3>
<p>German resident, Hai Maina Lanya, had an ambiguous relationship with a woman of the same nationality, Fa Sang (transliteration), when he was in Europe. After coming to Shanghai, they continued to associate with each other, appearing as husband and wife. In May of this year, Hai Maina Lanya discovered that his mistress had formed a relationship with another man. He negotiated with Fa Sang, but to no avail. Therefore, Hai Maina Lanya,</p>
<p>Disappointed in Love, Became Overcome with Jealousy. Because his jealousy was too strong, he developed murderous intentions. On June 11th, he wrote a suicide note, and the next morning, he took a razor to 915 Xiafei Road and killed his mistress, Fa Sang. However, he himself did not die. After the case occurred, the French Concession police ordered detectives to arrest Hai Maina Lanya and send him to the Second Special Court's Criminal Division to be prosecuted for murder. The case has been tried by Judge Liao several times, because the</p>
<p>Case is Complicated, A further investigation and hearing were ordered, as previously reported. Yesterday, Judge Liao opened Criminal Court One again to hear the case. The defendant, Hai Maina Lanya, still claimed that he initially intended to kill Fa Sang, but when he got up at about 5 a.m. on June 12, he had already abandoned his original plan because he considered that Fa Sang still had two children. He later didn't know why this disaster happened again. Subsequently, a German woman and two men testified that the deceased Fa Sang's private life</p>
<p>Was Like a Prostitute, saying that the deceased was unchaste. The defendant's defense lawyer requested the court to assess whether the defendant had a mental illness, saying that the defendant was too stimulated by the loss of love at the time, so his actions at the time of the incident were probably not the defendant's intention. The court verified the statements and ordered that the defendant in the Mu case be detained pending further investigation and hearing.</p>
<h3>Large Gambling Den to Open on Dongchang Road, Pudong</h3>

They failed and were arrested by the French police. They were ordered to be detained and investigated. It is now learned that the French police need to investigate the case in more detail, so they escorted the arrested criminals to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday morning to apply for an extension of detention for the purpose of investigation. Judge Liao ascended the seat and questioned them. After the defense lawyer Shen Ronghua of the defendant Ding Shaotong stated his opinion, the court ordered that the defendants in this case be detained and the hearing be postponed pending investigation.</p>

<h3>Pawnshop Accountant Abandons Pregnant Woman After Seduction: Accused of Seduction and Fraudulent Acquisition of Property: Further Hearing Held Yesterday, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Li Nianzhen, a woman from Sichuan, 21 years old, is quite beautiful. She used to work as a dancer in a dance hall. In January of this year, she married Peng Dajiang, a former clerk. Because Peng was unemployed, she continued her career as a dancer. In March of this year, she met Zhang Qiujiang, a young man from Ningbo (27 years old, an accountant at Hechang Pawnshop at 23 Ningbo Road), a former neighbor in Hongkou, and consequently,</p>
<p>A Relationship Developed.</p>
<p>Later, Zhang fell in love with Li's beautiful appearance and gentle manners, and even vowed to marry Li. At that time, Li already had a husband. Zhang then tried to enlist a friend and commissioned lawyer Gu Peilun to represent him in divorce proceedings against Li's husband, Peng Dajiang. Later, Zhang and Li were like husband and wife, going together every day, having illicit relations in rooms in places such as the Lushan Apartment and the Continental Hotel, and trying to swindle away Li's private savings of 1,000 yuan in a Bank of China passbook. After defiling her body and defrauding her of her money, Li became pregnant. Zhang was afraid of being burdened, so he</p>
<p>Abandoned Her.</p>
<p>Li Nianzhen then filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court, requesting that he be punished as he deserved. The court approved the lawsuit, and Judge Zhang Minsheng tried it once, ordering the defendant to post bail and summoning witnesses for further verification. Yesterday was another joint trial. Both parties arrived in court on time. According to witness lawyer Gu Peilun, Li Nianzhen originally knew him. A friend surnamed Cao introduced him and a Mr. Song called to commission him to handle the mediation of the divorce between Li and her husband Peng Dajiang. At one point,</p>
<p>Mediation Failed.</p>
<p>Later, Li did not come and did not formally file a lawsuit. According to Wang Afu, the teahouse waiter at the Lushan Apartment, on May 7, Li Nianzhen came to open a room and opened rooms 10 and 24, living there for a total of seven days. The registration book had Li's name. The defendant seemed to have come, but because there were too many people, he couldn't remember clearly. The court found that the case was clear and ordered the conclusion of the debate. The verdict was scheduled for the 25th. The defendant was still released on the original bail.</p>
<h3>American Woman Beaten and Humiliated: Japanese Soldiers Have Been Punished: American Consulate's Negotiation Has Received a Response: Japanese Military Orders Preferential Treatment of Americans</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that after the American Consul-General in Tianjin protested the incident in which a Japanese sentry in Tianjin beat Mrs. Li Quete, a 59-year-old American woman, last week, the Japanese side has responded. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy at a press conference yesterday (the 18th), the Japanese Consul-General received a protest on the 15th of this month and sent a reply two days later, stating that the Japanese authorities were very sorry for the unfortunate incident. However, the words of Mrs. Li Quete in the newspaper were somewhat inconsistent with the results of the Japanese investigation. The Japanese sentry responsible has been duly punished in accordance with military law. The Japanese military authorities have also issued further orders to strictly instruct that Americans who behave normally must be treated with due courtesy. The spokesman believed that the preferential treatment of Americans was unique. It is said that since the case only involved Americans, the Japanese side sent a reply to the American Consul-General and only mentioned Americans.</p>
<h3>Tenants of Eleven Apartments Fight with Landlords: Organize the Shanghai Tenants' Association: Plan to Deal with Rent Increases</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that representatives of tenants from eleven apartments including Jing'an Temple Apartments gathered last night (the 18th) to discuss the establishment of the Shanghai Tenants' Association as a backing for fighting against rent increases. They unanimously passed a resolution that it is necessary to organize a union at present, and resolved that (1) the Tenants' Association is established for the benefit of tenants of all nationalities to protect tenants and oppose landlords' use of the current</p>
<p>Abnormal Situation to Make Excessive and Unreasonable Rent Increases, which place an unbearable burden on the citizens of Shanghai and endanger the economic structure of the city; (2) to engage in liaison work between tenants and landlords. The initiators are looking for a suitable hall to hold</p>
<p>Nationalities</p>
<p>Tenants' Congress. It was decided last night that the Property Owners' Association will be invited to send representatives to the Congress to explain the reasons for the large rent increase and the demand for rent to be paid in foreign currency. It is understood that arrangements have been made for a certain celebrity to serve as the chairman of the final Congress.</p>
<p>Membership Fee Issue</p>
<p>Will be discussed at the Tenants' Congress. However, due to the urgent need for funds, the initiators welcome voluntary donations from all parties, regardless of the amount, to be delivered to Mr. Macostella, 45 Huayuan Apartments, 1173 Jing'an Temple Road. It was disclosed at last night's meeting that a major real estate company in the city had previously requested US dollars or</p>
<p>Pounds to pay the rent, but due to the clamor of the tenants, it voluntarily reduced its requested rent increase by 12% and collected it in legal tender. However, this arrangement can be revised every three months and the rent adjusted according to the cost of operating the property.</p>
<p>Chinese Join</p>
<p>The Chinese-language newspaper Zilinbao reported that a number of foreigners in Shanghai held a meeting last night (the 18th) to establish the "Shanghai Tenants' Association" to deal with the complex rent problem in this overpopulated city. It is learned from reliable sources that the new association will hold its first public congress sometime next week. Chinese people may also join the movement. It is expected that the initiators will issue a public announcement to the newspapers.</p>

<h3>Shipyard Foreman's Extortion Case Reopened</h3>
<p>Tang Ashu, a native of Pudong who lives at 25 Huayuanfang, Quanshenfu Road, received six threatening letters in succession in May of this year.

The matter failed and they were arrested and transferred to the Second Special Court to be prosecuted for extortion. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Liao reopened the trial. According to Tang Ji, the son of the plaintiff, when he reported to the court for the trial, he falsely accused his father of contracting to repair the Japanese Izumo warship, which was inconsistent with the facts. His father served in the Jiangnan Shipyard in his early years and changed to the British-owned United Shipyard after the war. The court verified the statements and interrogated the two defendants. The court held that the case still needed to be investigated and the hearing should be postponed.</p>

The Capital Court issued a warrant for his arrest. On May 29th of this year, he was arrested by the Lao Zha police and sent to the First Special Court to request the High Court to designate a trial result. Jin Yushu was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for business embezzlement. Jin Feng felt that the sentence was too heavy and filed a complaint with the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting a reduction in the sentence.

<p>(Chongqing Airlines News) In order to promote the rapid popularization of compulsory education, so that out-of-school children can receive education and in-school children can have more beneficial friends, and thus improve the national level, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated eleven articles on the method of setting up compulsory tutoring classes for children in elementary schools, and ordered all elementary schools across the country to comply.

Each group should be based on seven to ten people; (5) In addition to direct teaching by teachers, excellent children originally in the school should be trained as tutors for each group to assist the children in each group in learning at school and regularly guide self-study in their families; (6) The study period will be the completion of a one-year or two-year short-term elementary school curriculum. Upon completion of the study period and passing grades, the Compulsory Education Committee of each county and city will issue a certificate.

<h3>Finance: Exchange Rate Lingers; Speculators Spread Rumors Again; Generally Not Believed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the HSBC listing was announced, with no changes. In the grey market for British and American exchanges, the situation was initially quite stable. After 9:45 AM, as Japanese commercial banks and foreign firms came to cover their positions, and Western firm Sassoon also aggressively covered futures, the situation gradually weakened. At one point, British gold was the tightest, having been quoted at 3/16375. The American exchange was the weakest, having also been quoted at 6.5625 yuan. Subsequently, as Western firm Sassoon suddenly resold spot British and American exchanges, the situation returned to normal. As a result, the British exchange was slightly tighter by 0.015625, and the American exchange was slightly weaker by 0.03125. August and September futures showed no gains or losses. In the middle of the day, speculators spread rumors that there would be drastic changes in the exchange rate next Monday, but most operators did not believe it. Furthermore, amid the active support of China by Britain and America, and with the instability in Europe, they did not dare to immediately increase their positions, so they adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in limited trading throughout the day.</p>
<p>Japanese Firms Covering Positions, Sassoon Reselling</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London spot exchange was up 0.0625 for the near term and 0.125 for the far term. The New York silver price rose 0.125, and London bullion remained stable. Exchange rates for British to American and British to French were both stable, while British to Shanghai was up 0.0625. American to British and American to French were both stable, while American to Shanghai was up 0.05. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 3/164375 for British gold and 6.6875 yuan for the American exchange, with no gains or losses compared to the previous close. After opening, HSBC absorbed spot British gold at 3/164375 from its counterparts, and the situation was extremely stagnant. When the HSBC listing was announced, there were no changes. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it remained exempt from minor taxes. After this, Japanese commercial banks and foreign firms competed to cover their positions, and Western firm Sassoon also purchased futures, so the market weakened. It is estimated that the Japanese banks and foreign firms covered positions with advantageous British banks and certain American banks for spot British gold at 3/1640625 and spot American exchange at 6.625 yuan. Subsequently, Sassoon purchased futures British gold for September at 3/16 and 2/1696875, and American exchange for the same month at 5.8125 and 5.75. Later, spot British gold was once quoted at 3/16375, and the American exchange was also quoted at 6.5625 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, Western firm Sassoon suddenly sold spot British gold at 3/1640625 and 3/164375 to HSBC and other foreign banks, and then sold spot American exchange at 6.625 and 6.6875 to a certain bank and Datong. As a result, the situation returned to normal. It was already noon. Extending to the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 3/16421875 for British gold and 6.65625 yuan for the American exchange. British gold for the current month was 3/16375, and the American exchange was 6.5625 yuan. British gold for September was 3/16, and the American exchange was 5.8125. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British was slightly tighter by 0.015625, and the American exchange was slightly weaker by 0.031225.

The "Joint Notes" grey market price was down 3.5 yuan to 99 yuan.</p>
<p>Bullion Market Calm</p>
<p>Yesterday's grey market situation for immediate delivery of bullion was similar to the previous day, hovering around the closing price of the previous night. At the opening, bullion shops were very willing to sell, and buyers and retail investors were unwilling to buy, so the opening price immediately fell to 4,525 yuan. It then declined further to a low of 4,520 yuan. After 10:00 AM, news of a weakening foreign exchange market stimulated buying sentiment. Tianjin and Hong Kong dealers commissioned their agents in the market to compete to buy, and certain money exchange firms and banks also bought on behalf of their customers. As a result, the market price once rose to a high of 4,590 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, news of a return to normalcy in the foreign exchange market led to a resurgence of selling. A certain gold shop came to sell on behalf of speculators, and the underlying trend once again declined. Extending to the noon close, the market fell by 5 yuan. There was no formal market in the afternoon, but there were also few changes outside the market, and prices remained between 4,550 and 4,560 yuan. About 600 taels were traded during the day. There were no changes in gold jewelry prices, and bullion and British gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Bullion Down Just a Little by Five Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, per tael (ten liang), the initial opening was met with dampened spirits. Bullion shops were eager to sell, and the foreign exchange market was very stable, so under the cover of selling pressure, the price immediately fell by 35 yuan. Bullion shops sold 20 taels to money exchange firms for 4,525 yuan. It then continued to fall by 5 yuan. Bullion shops made 30 taels of mutual deals at a price of 4,520 yuan, the low for the day. At 9:45 AM, news of a weakening foreign exchange market stimulated buying sentiment. Certain bullion shops and securities firms aggressively bought on behalf of their customers, and certain money exchange firms also absorbed on behalf of wealthy merchants, and the underlying trend suddenly reversed upwards. Soon after, it soared by 70 yuan. Cash shops made 10 taels of mutual deals at a price of 4,590 yuan, the high for the day. Thereafter, dealers adopted a selling and buying stance, and once hovered between 4,570 and 4,580 yuan, creating an opportunity for retail investors to scalp. Around 11:00 AM, news of a return to normalcy in the foreign exchange market led to an increase in sellers. Certain gold shops and speculators came to sell, and the market weakened. Money exchange firms made 20 taels of mutual deals at a price of 4,545 yuan. Approaching noon, the situation slightly recovered. Other shops made 20 taels of mutual deals for 4,555 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it continued to fall by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The difference between the high and low was 70 yuan throughout the day. The current price of bullion at cash shops was 10 yuan higher than that of immediate delivery bullion, and the current price of silver bullion was 65 yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Still at Original Price</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael remained unchanged. Datong Bank remained at the original price of 460 yuan, and Xintong Bank was at 458 yuan. Purchase prices were reduced by about 10 to 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Bullion Stagnant</p>
<p>London, 18th - British bullion remained stagnant as before, at £7 8s 7d per ounce, so the market prices of the central banks remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Call Loan Rate Low, Discount Rate Also Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bill discount rate continued to fall. Throughout the day, it hovered around 190 yuan per thousand, with a high of 192 yuan and a low of 187 yuan. It remained at 190 yuan in the afternoon, 2.5 yuan lower than the previous day. The Money Industry Association's call loan rate suddenly fell by 0.01, hanging at 0.017 in both the morning and afternoon, it is said.</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Rise</h3>
<p>London, 18th - The silver market was limited by Indian and speculative buying. The market was stable. After closing, India continued to absorb slightly at the listed price. The spot price for large bars of silver rose 0.0625 for the near term and 0.125 for the far term. The New York silver exchange stated that American spot prices rose 0.125. Also, the Bombay silver exchange stated that the Indian silver market was calm, with no gains or losses in both spot and futures prices. Only 50 contracts were traded, it is said.</p>
<h3>Black Market Exchange Rate Stable: Trade with Shanghai — Dependent on the Size of the Trade Deficit</h3>
<p>Although Shanghai's monthly trade deficit decreased from 42,056,000 yuan in June to 16,909,000 yuan, a reduction of 25,147,000 yuan, it cannot be said that the drastic reduction in the black market exchange rate was successful. However, it is still too costly for Shanghai to burden China's foreign exchange fund with an expenditure of more than 16 million yuan. However, it can be predicted that Shanghai's trade deficit from August onwards will be less than that of July, because the impact of the drastic reduction in the black market exchange rate on trade will inevitably be greater than that of July. As for Shanghai's black market exchange rate, although it is more stable than before, it is difficult to stabilize it unless the difference between Shanghai's import and export values is roughly balanced, or the difference is within the range of several million yuan.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Rising British and American Gold Notes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currencies: the supply and demand for British and American gold pounds were not strong, and the market was stable. Only the American dollar slightly decreased, while British and American gold notes were firm and rose, likely due to the tightening of the foreign exchange rate. The supply of Hong Kong notes was relatively smooth, and the market price eased. The demand for French franc notes was strong and popular, while Japanese gold notes were firm. The evening price was 1.18 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was not smooth, and the market was quite popular. The evening price was 0.995 yuan. Other currencies were stable due to weak supply and demand on Saturday. The association did not open trading. Yesterday's market prices: British gold notes rose 0.08 yuan, American gold pounds fell 0.05 yuan, American gold notes rose 0.019 yuan, Hong Kong notes fell 0.001 yuan, French franc notes rose 0.003 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Weakness Inside and Out</h3>
<p>Yesterday's grey market for securities turned weak again. The rising trend could not be sustained, indicating the weakness of investor sentiment. Internationally, the situation was tight and relaxed at times, and the exchange rate situation was increasingly tight. Domestically, the war was at a stalemate, and government bonds were not being considered and were difficult to rally, which was largely the reason. Small players in the market were merely taking advantage of the environment. Yesterday's trading was still extremely sluggish. Large investors were absent early in the day, relying only on sporadic transactions from retail investors. Most of the buying and selling was short-term in nature. Although Lian Hongkang and Tongkang bought in yesterday, and only Lianyi and Yongkang were sellers, the market still appeared weak. As a result, it fell by a small amount of 0.025 to 0.06 yuan, and 96 fell by a small amount of 0.015 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 200,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange trading totaled 50 shares at a price of 25.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the public exchange continued to weaken, with the prices of many stocks falling slightly. However, the trading volume was very limited. Anxiety over the European situation was the only driving force behind investor unease, as there were no other factors that could explain the decline in the market. Also, due to the weekend, most traders wanted to reduce their long positions to avoid unexpected risks.</p>
<p>The listed market prices of London British firms' Far East companies' stocks on Friday, the 18th of this month, fell slightly. HSBC Bank's British-registered shares continued to fall by 0.5 pounds to 72 pounds. Gula Craig rubber stocks fell by 7.5 pence to 17 shillings 6 pence. The remaining stocks remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The London Chinese foreign debt market prices on Friday, the 18th of this month, remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Market Closed</h3>
<p>Native Indica Rice: Two batches totaling 3,400 to 3,500 bags arrived yesterday by ship. There is still a whole batch of 8,000 bags that are expected to arrive in port today or tomorrow. However, all the goods were unloaded at Hongkou. Other small-scale merchants who transport and sell the goods are still few in number. As for the shops and households on this street, yesterday was even more active. Although the rice market was closed in the morning, the association and those who purchased directly in batches were offering higher prices to compete for the goods in the afternoon. As a result, it was reported that Jing Indica rice was sold at 29.5 yuan. Ordinary Indica rice also reached 28.5 yuan, coarse Indica rice was about 26 yuan, and brown rice was 24 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Restricting Sales to Customers; Trade in Recycled Goods Booming; Higher Than Mill Prices by About 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Flour continued to be brisk. After the mills only supplied retail customers on this street and restricted sales to other customers and wholesale transactions, the trade in recycled goods on the market was quite brisk, due to the favor of customers. Yesterday's mill price was 6 yuan in cash, while recycled goods were higher than the mill price by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Wheat was also in great demand. Shipments arrived from all directions, and demand was also quite strong, causing the market to rise by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Fufeng and Liangfu mills purchased 20 truckloads of Danyang and Wuxi wheat. Stockholders purchased 10 truckloads of wheat from Guantian, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Longtan. The highest price was 9.48 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Tense Atmosphere in Hong Kong and Guangdong; Cotton Yarn's Rising Momentum Halted</h3>
<p>The yarn market started rising but then retreated. This situation has been going on for three days, but market sentiment is still not bad. Most believe that the raw materials are expensive, so they are optimistic about finished goods. However, some believe that prices have reached a high level, and that those who have profited have already made a lot of money, so small stockholders are gradually selling when prices rise. However, those who are serious buyers remain calm. Recently, the range of fluctuations has been within 10 yuan. 20-count special Jincheng is approaching the 800 yuan mark at 795 yuan.</p>
<p>As for the current situation of yarn, the opening price in the morning was based on the 20-count Shuangma brand from the previous day. Because of the shortage of spot goods, market sentiment was still enthusiastic. However, the prices of other new brands of yarn rose accordingly. The 20-count Shuangma foreign bonded goods rose by more than 5 yuan to 780 yuan. Buyers of warehouse receipts were very enthusiastic, pushing the price beyond 700 yuan to 705 yuan. Shortly thereafter, news that business from Guangdong was sluggish due to the tense atmosphere in Hong Kong and Guangdong caused the market to suddenly weaken, falling by 7 to 8 yuan. It is estimated that 1,035 bales were traded in the half-day. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 2 yuan, and the price of Muyang fell by 2 yuan. Today, 50 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 55 bales will be shipped to Haiphong. Tomorrow, there will be another 10 bales shipped to Haiphong. The amounts purchased by various dealers are listed below:</p>
<p>Counterparts: 490; Hong Kong: 105</p>
<p>Mainland: 420; Fuzhou: 10</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 10; Total: 1,035</p>
<h3>Cotton Inventories Declining Daily; Spot Goods Tight, Not For Sale</h3>
<p>The trade in Chinese and foreign cotton has become quiet. Since prices are too high, manufacturers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the demand is shallow. Only Yong'an and Hongzhang mills purchased 500 bales of Indian cotton at a price of 112.75 yuan, all of which were sent to the mill in cash. Counterparts' interest in mutual transactions is not as strong as in the past. However, the cotton inventories on the market are decreasing daily. As for foreign firms, the prices they are offering are still high. Some spot goods are tight and not for sale, so market prices continue to rise. 640 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived from northern Jiangsu. 150 bales of Indian cotton continued to arrive, shipped on the Da Ying Company's Rajiputana (transliteration) ship, and were imported at 6:00 PM yesterday, docking at buoys 11 and 12 for unloading. The selling situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Another news report from the Shanghai port stated that the market has been rife with rumors that customs taxes will increase starting next month. As a result, dealers do not plan to sell their spot goods, and mills are deeply concerned that the rumored tax increase will become a reality, which will increase cotton prices. As a result, they have been eager to buy in recent days. In the end, because there are not many inventories in Shanghai, prices have not been able to ease.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices in New York City were firm in the early morning due to speculative buying. In recent days, because of the brisk sales of textiles, spot transactions have been increasingly active. The purchases of overseas cotton merchants in the market have also slightly increased. Weather reports from cotton-growing areas are bad, so market prices soared by 5 pounds sterling yesterday. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 25 rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 20 pounds sterling.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake: Crude Oil Soars; Opening at 71 Yuan; Soybean Oil Falls Initially but Recovers Later</h3>
<p>The oil market has been highly volatile. Soybean oil initially fell but later recovered. Crude oil has seen a sharp rise due to scarce arrivals and inventories, which is unprecedented in the market. The price of Qingdao barrel crude oil rose sharply by 3 yuan in one day. The highest price has reached 71 yuan. It is estimated that more than 400 pieces of Jiaozhou basket crude oil were traded, with prices ranging from 55.5 yuan to 56 yuan. Transshipment prices ranged from 54 yuan to 56 yuan. 50 pieces of Yantai basket crude oil were sold for 54 yuan to Hong Kong dealers. In addition, more than 100 barrels of Qingdao barrel crude oil were sold for prices ranging from 69 yuan to 71 yuan. 30 barrels of Kobe barrel crude oil were sold for 67 yuan. Soybean oil initially fell by 1 to 2 yuan. In the afternoon, Hong Kong dealers began to buy, which stimulated market sentiment. Stockholders bought in, and prices rose again by 1.7 to 1.8 yuan. It is estimated that more than 600 pieces of various oils were traded. For details, please refer to the market price section.</p>
<p>2,360 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha on the 19th. Another 1,315 bags were shipped to Hong Kong on the 20th, 610 bags on the 21st, and 445 pieces of crude oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Pingshui Rough Tea Gets Good Price</h3>
<p>Since the Silk and Tea Management Office sent personnel to provide guidance, the refining process of Pingshui rough tea has shown initial signs of success. However, it is still made by hand. The high price of special rough tea is sustainable, which is unprecedented in more than ten years. Currently, the lowest price still needs to be 36 to 37 yuan, so tea farmers are all delighted. Tea merchants have also made a profit of 10%, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Eases; Dutch Red Rises by 1 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw little change according to foreign news. The association's market estimates have eased. Spot goods 24 coarse are down by 1.3 to 1.4 yuan, in-bond 40.3 yuan, to 40 yuan, out-bond 40.1 yuan 100 bags, 39.6 yuan 300 bags, transit goods down by 0.8 yuan, 32 yuan 200 bags, Taikoo cart white is down by 0.5 yuan, East Bond B mark 44.1 yuan 200 bags, West Bond CW mark 44.2 yuan, CX mark 43.9 yuan, DY mark 43.5 yuan, XH mark 43.3 yuan, H mark cart white with original price 27 yuan, traded 3,500 bags, Dutch red spot goods up 1 yuan, to 35 yuan, transit up 0.7 yuan, to 28.5 yuan, native cotton white down 1.5 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 40 yuan, No. 2 39.5 yuan, native No. 1 ice down 1 yuan, to 44.5 yuan, Jingming ice 46 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Indian Coal Arrives Successively; Coal Prices Remain High</h3>
<p>Coal prices in this city are soaring. Indian coal is arriving steadily. The King Edward, managed by Jardine Matheson, loaded 7,054 tons of coal from Calcutta, India, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 21st) morning, docking at buoys 32 and 33 for transshipment and unloading. (Year)</p>
<p>Kailan lump coal and fines are scarce, and market inventories are thin, seeing frequent increases. Kailan No. 1 lump has been quoted at 66 yuan, No. 2 lump 55 yuan, No. 1 fines 48 yuan to 50 yuan, and No. 1 fines 43 yuan. The above are all transactions between counterparts, with shipments from Pudong warehouses, an increase of 6 to 7 yuan per ton compared to the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: New Longan Meat 110 Yuan</h3>
<p>The first batch of more than 20 pieces of new Hainan longan meat that arrived the day before yesterday was reportedly sold by dealers yesterday at a price of 110 yuan, which is also a high price. Dried seafood fell in price, and it was sold at 60 yuan. After the price was reduced, the sales were quite brisk, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Current Difficulties Facing Shanghai's Raw Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Qu Yang</p>
<p>Currently, the price of silk in Shanghai has increased fivefold compared to the early days of the war; the export volume has doubled compared to the first year after the war; and the profits from silk production have risen to one hundred percent. Who can deny that such a prosperous scene is an unprecedented boom for the Shanghai silk industry? However, why do people in the silk industry, from factory owners to workers, say that this is the end of the silk industry? How can this doomsday appear in such a prosperous guise? Is it truly a case of "when things reach an extreme, they revert"? Furthermore, should we merely wait passively for this doomsday to arrive? Of course not. Therefore, people in the silk industry should take advantage of the present situation to carefully consider all aspects of the silk industry at this stage, analyze its fundamental characteristics, predict the potential crises it may face, and study how to respond so that the Shanghai silk industry can overcome difficulties and embark on a bright future. What is presented here is merely a glimpse of the bigger picture. The author's intention is to draw attention to this issue from both industry insiders and outsiders, and to encourage further research into this problem. Now, I will briefly express my humble opinions, hoping for corrections from readers.</p>
<p>(I) After the war, the trend of the Shanghai silk industry is abnormal, and its prosperity is pathological.</p>
<p>Statistics of Shanghai Silk Factories Before and After the War</p>
<p>We remember that before the war, there were 44 silk factories operating in Shanghai, with a total of 10,086 silk reeling machines. During the war, 34 silk factories were destroyed by the flames of aggression, with 6,836 silk reeling machines. Only 10 silk factories survived, with 2,562 silk reeling machines. In the past two years, new silk factories have sprung up in the concession areas like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. To date, adding these to the surviving factories, the total number of silk factories in Shanghai is 35, with a total of 6,222 silk reeling machines. Given such a short period of time to restore the above figures, the speed of the Shanghai silk industry's recovery after the war should be praised. However, why is its trend said to be abnormal?</p>
<p>Successful Reconstruction of the Silk Industry After the War</p>
<p>Shanghai has become an isolated island, and its inherent economic center should have moved inland. Because Shanghai, after becoming an isolated island, has many special and complex conditions that we can utilize, the industrial and commercial enterprises within it, besides those that benefit from these conditions, cannot obtain the freedom of raw materials and finished products, or transport them. In other words, all industries in Shanghai after the war, if they do not move, will inevitably become indirect or direct economic appendages to it. This is why the industries in occupied Shanghai must move inland. However, our Shanghai silk industry was too negligent, and even went further to try to rebuild its "business" in the "urn."</p>
<p>Under this mentality, although the movement to rebuild the silk industry after the war was vigorous, its development direction was inevitably speculative, pessimistic, and aimed at temporary luck. We probably have not forgotten that in the early days of the silk industry's revitalization after the war, the saying "silk factories only have eight months of life," which was widely circulated and regarded as clever, was a typical portrayal of this sentiment. In fact, the Shanghai silk industry could only survive on this dead-end foundation.</p>
<p>The prosperity brought by the initial survival was the day and night production of raw silk. Under the principle of rapid silk production, rapid disposal, and rapid profit, although the quality of raw silk was disregarded, and although the reduction in Japanese silk production of 20-22 denier last year was ignored, and Shanghai's silk of the same denier was not given the opportunity to sell abroad at a better price, the fact is that the export volume of raw silk last year rose to 37,596 piculs, exceeding the first year after the war by almost double, and almost restoring the pre-war export level. The profit from silk production exceeded the capital amount by one or more times, reaching an unprecedented level of prosperity.</p>
<p>What is the second phenomenon that follows this prosperity? It is a transition from a speculative, pessimistic, and opportunistic mentality to a risky, bold, and all-in action. This further pathological characteristic can be easily found in this year's spring cocoon purchase situation.</p>
<p>Pathological Development of Shanghai's Silk Industry</p>
<p>Exchange rate fluctuations began in August last year, with the first drop from one shilling and two pence to eight and a quarter pence; the second was in early June this year, further decreasing to six and a half pence; the third was recently, dropping to three and a quarter pence. As for silk prices, following the tightening of foreign exchange, the price of White Filature XB 20-22 denier rose from 760 yuan per picul in January of the previous year to 1,200 yuan in August of the same year. From June of this year to the present, the price of silk has risen from 2,000 yuan to 3,800 yuan. This second foreign exchange contraction is now happening at the end of the spring cocoon purchase, and the industry is facing strong detention and bargaining over the "transit" issue.</p>
<p>In early June this year, according to our newspaper's cocoon news, the inconvenient transportation of spring cocoons in the interior (including between inland areas, and inland areas and Shanghai), the "control" and destruction of cocoon factories, led to a concentration of the cocoon market and a sharp drop in cocoon prices. The price of spring cocoons on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line fell to 45 yuan. Based on this cocoon cost, including all expenses, the cost of silk per picul was only 700 yuan. If it were sold abroad at the then market price, each picul of raw silk made from fresh cocoons could earn a profit of over 600 yuan. However, in reality, because Shanghai silk merchants valued the high profits, they were more generous in response to the other party's extortion. As a result, the other party became more greedy and took further advantage, and the issue of spring cocoon transportation went beyond the scope of "donations and taxes" and began to involve discussions about confiscation and release percentages.</p>
<p>So, will the Shanghai raw silk industry compromise again at the cost of pain? The answer is possibly yes, because the degree of compromise in the Shanghai silk industry will increase and deepen with the high profits from silk production. The reason for this is self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>The Problems of School Enrollment and Employment for Children</h3>
<p>Jin Ding</p>
<p>During this long, more than fifty-day summer vacation, children who have just graduated from elementary school are undoubtedly contemplating the issue of school enrollment and employment. What kind of school should children preparing to enroll in? What kind of job should children preparing for employment take? This is indeed an issue worth studying and considering.</p>
<p>I believe that children preparing to enroll in school should first investigate whether the school's content is substantial, whether the teaching is strict, whether the school spirit is excellent, and whether the fees are reasonable. If most of these points are considered satisfactory, then they should register and take the exam without any hesitation. If most of these points are considered unsatisfactory, then they should carefully consider and choose a school that meets the standards. This is my personal opinion for children regarding school enrollment.</p>
<p>As for children preparing for employment, you should know that reading is the preparation for employment, and employment is the practice of reading. Being forced by circumstances to discontinue schooling is nothing to be sad about. Because after employment, as long as you have determination and perseverance, you still have the opportunity to read and study anytime, anywhere. However, what occupation is suitable for your personality and can develop your strengths is something that should be considered before employment. In my opinion, children preparing for employment should first publicly explain their aspirations and strengths to their parents, teachers, friends, and relatives, hoping that they will have a basis when recommending occupations for you. As for the children themselves, they should also have a preliminary understanding of the ideal job content, so that they will not feel the pain of being unable to start once they enter the door of this occupation. If every employed child can do this, then they will definitely reduce many unnecessary losses on the path of employment. In short, the problems of school enrollment and employment for children are indeed worth studying and considering. Parents, teachers, friends, and relatives of children should take responsibility to solve this important problem for these innocent and inexperienced children. The above remarks are just suggestions for everyone's reference.</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>— Wang Pei</p>
<p>Why: Why can airplanes fly in the sky? Why can wireless electricity transmit sound? Why can electric lights automatically emit light? Why can a day have night? Why after incubation, will goose eggs hatch chicks? Why do trees and flowers wither in winter? Why this? Why that? "Why" is infinite. Only "why" is energetic, progressive, and only "why" can enrich life, improve society, and create the world.</p>
<p>Why can the steam from boiling water push the kettle lid and invent the steam engine? Why will electric sparks occur at both ends of a broken current copper coin, thus inventing incandescent lamps and arc lamps? In short, no matter how big or small the matter is, as long as it goes through the "why" experiment, there will always be a novel creation, and the world will naturally progress with "why"!</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shi also has a paragraph in his "New Life" that means: "A person's life, only after experiencing "why," does that life have meaning. A meaningful life is called a new life."</p>
<p>Children! Do you want to live a new life? Then don't forget "why"!</p>
<h3>Abandoning the Boat and Boarding the Car</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>Ming Er's Refugee Diary - Thirty</p>
<p>In the boat cabin, the refugees were all done with dinner and the air in the cabin suddenly became tense. The housewives from all three families were packing their eating utensils and tidying up their belongings, because this was the last night they would spend on the Jiangshan ship. They all closed their eyes, rested their minds, and no one slept soundly.</p>
<p>"Don't sleep too soundly. We will have a lot of work to do as soon as it gets light. We have to pack up our bedding, eat breakfast, move our luggage, and we need to get to the bus station as early as possible. So we have to work quickly and carefully, because we heard that the buses don't run regularly. Sometimes if we are lucky, a bus will run, but some people have been waiting in hotels near the station for many days and still haven't caught a bus. We will have to rely on our luck then," Mr. Zhang muttered incessantly.</p>
<p>"Why don't they run?" one of them asked. "Because during the war, in our industrially backward country, military equipment is naturally insufficient, and buses are one of them. So civilian buses are used to supplement them, and as a result, civilian buses are in extremely short supply and have to be suspended," Mr. Zhang replied, assigning the work to everyone.</p>
<p>The refugees waited for the east to turn white, they had waited on the Jiangshan ship for a full seventeen days. Before dawn, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li jumped ashore to negotiate about the bus, leaving Ming Er's father to manage everything on the ship. As soon as the rooster crowed, the people on the ship seemed extraordinarily busy. Ming Er's mother led her young siblings, stepping onto the shore from the narrow plank, and the other women also followed ashore. Ming Er's brother monitored the boatmen moving the luggage in the cabin. Ming Er stood on the shore and counted the number of luggage items according to the luggage list, separating the luggage of the three families and piling them up separately by the boatmen. This chaotic scene lasted for about half an hour. Finally, Ming Er's father checked everything one by one, inspected the cabin again to make sure nothing was left behind, and paid the boat fare to the boatman. But the boatman was not straightforward. When disembarking in Hangzhou, it was stated that the boat fare and all the wine money were included, but when he was leaving, he asked for wine money and firewood money. After a lot of arguing, some money was still added, which shows that they were really petty.</p>
<p>With a lot of effort, they finally managed to send a large group of refugees and a large pile of heavy luggage to the bus station. When they got there, they saw a sea of people and luggage filling the entire narrow station, it was really packed like sardines.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang squeezed out of the crowd and happily reached Ming Er's father: "Our luck is really good, there are two buses today. The ticket office over there is extremely crowded. It's really unexpected, the ticket seller is my old classmate, I got the tickets without much effort, otherwise we might have to wait for two or three days. Your luggage is over there, ask them to move it. The bus is going to leave at eight o'clock this morning, but there are a lot of us, the ticket seller suggested that we go in two buses, it would be better."</p>
<p>Ming Er's father was overjoyed to hear this and said: "Great, this is your great achievement, we must reward you." "No, your contribution is also great, so many people and luggage came to the station together, otherwise, even if I bought the tickets, it would be useless. This is the benefit of our cooperation." So this large group of refugees were separated and squeezed onto the bus, heading straight towards their destination like flying.</p>

<p>Interesting Little Handicraft</p>
<h3>Goldfish Wind Chime</h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>Children, the long summer vacation is coming to an end soon, and you will soon be going to school to study new books. Here, I will tell you how to make a small toy of a golden banana wind chime as a small handicraft for the summer vacation. Its production method is very simple, and the materials are all available to you.</p>
<p>Materials: A sheet of thick drawing paper, a strip of green satin (14 inches long), two peas, several threads (40-50 inches long), watercolor paint, glue.</p>
<p>Method: First, refer to the attached drawing and draw two pieces of thick drawing paper, 1 and 2. The width of 1 is four centimeters, and the length is from thirty to forty centimeters. 2 is divided into two strips, each strip is one centimeter wide, and the length is slightly longer than 1. After drawing, apply the color immediately, the colors of 1 and 2 must be different. If you want to make it more beautiful, you can use colored paper instead. First glue 1 into a circle, and then glue the two strips of 2 separately on the edges of the two sides of the circle. Then, use thick paper to cut goldfish (red, gold, yellow, black, white, and flower colors are all acceptable) two tails, green paper leaves two pieces, wind chimes (yellow) three pieces according to the attached drawings 3, 4, 6; first fold the goldfish according to the dotted line, and then glue them together, and then hang them on the round paper circle with two sections of silk thread (as shown in the attached picture): Then bend the three pieces of wind chimes and glue them together. After the above pieces are completed, you can thread a long thread through the middle ends of the round paper circle so that it can be suspended. Two green leaves are threaded in the thread section above the circle, and a green pea (5) is embedded under each leaf. This bean must be soaked in water first so that it can be threaded through; with the pea, the two leaves will not overlap. In the thread section below the circle, in addition to tying the paper wind chime, a light blue soft satin (7) is hung at the tail end, and the words "Made by so-and-so" can also be written on the soft satin. If there is no soft satin, you can use a hair tie made of colored silk thread instead. In addition, if you tie two small bells on the long line, then when a breeze blows: the goldfish dance, the wind chimes turn, the ribbons flutter, and the clear sound of the small bells is added, it is really very interesting?</p>
<p>Children, why don't you make a few "Goldfish Wind Chimes" and hang them under the window of your studio or under the corridor for decoration? If you give it to your good friends, they will definitely be very welcome!</p>

<h3>In the Realm of Animals (14)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>They both still fell down, falling down, constantly falling! The road seemed particularly long, particularly far! At this time, the night had passed, and the morning came, the sun shone brightly, but they were still falling down, falling down, Peng Qi kept shouting "Ah! Ah!" Lev also kept barking "Woof woof woof", the bell on its collar kept ringing, until later it was pulled to the top of the river, Peng Qi was taken aback, and before he could shout for help, he and Lev fell into the water together. Lev could swim, and after a while, it swam ashore, but Peng Qi couldn't swim. He took a mouthful of water and sank to the place where he used to drown dogs. Peng Chun suffocated and couldn't breathe, gasping for air, struggling in the water, just like the miserable scene he had seen with his own eyes when he drowned dogs before. He didn't know that he would actually perform it himself, which was really unexpected! He kept struggling in the water, suffocating even more severely, his head seemed to explode, but he couldn't shout, because his mouth was blocked by the water.</p>
<p>Peng Qi struggled in the water, his two hands frantically grabbing at the surface of the water, grabbing something that floated by, but it was useless, because it was the corpse of a dead dog, which he had thrown into the river last night. This scare was even more severe than the cold water stimulation. He thought that he might drown here and rot with the dead cats and dogs he had abused to death. At that time, on a tree nearby, a crow kept croaking, "Serve him right! Punish him well!" Many frogs were sitting on the river bank, looking at the corpses of those animals, croaking madly, "Throw stones at him! Throw stones at him!"</p>
<p>A pike was swimming back and forth nearby. It didn't have any ill feelings towards Peng Qi, because it had enjoyed several delicious meals by relying on Peng Qi's cruelty. But this pike was as selfish as ordinary animals. It was waiting for an opportunity to eat Peng Qi as well.</p>
<p>The more Peng Qi struggled, the more he sank. All the cruel memories of the past, like watching a movie, flashed through his mind one by one, and the endless flowing water kept rushing over him. He remembered the first big bee he had killed, and he also remembered sticking a thorn into the nose of Knox. Everything, everything, surged into his heart like a tide, seeming to be settling his cruel old debts, causing him to suffer infinite pain in his conscience, and unknowingly he hated himself.</p>
<p>After a while, he suddenly floated up from the water, floated to the surface of the water and exhaled, seeing the blue sky, how beautiful it was! He also heard a rail calling in the field, that field was the place where his two little sisters wanted him to pick lotus fragrant flowers. After a while, in a daze, he seemed to see Knox's smooth and lovely head also floating and sinking in the water. He was suddenly startled and muttered to himself, "No no no! God is above, I have never killed it!"</p>
<p>So he sank again. He thought of his home, thought of his father and mother, and thought of his two little sisters, whom he often bullied, killing the animals they loved, seeing them cry in a hurry, and mocking them. He also remembered how, during last summer's vacation, they welcomed him back home, their hats were filled with flowers, and they made flower rings and put them on the donkey's two long ears. He also remembered how he stabbed the donkey with a wooden stick with nails in it, stabbing it so that it ran around and jumped, causing his little sisters to scream, but he thought it was very fun! Oh! He remembered again how he usually avoided these two innocent and lively little sisters, preferring to be with that uneducated and evil little blacksmith, and he felt very proud. Then he suddenly remembered the very comfortable bed he slept on every night, his mother had to bless him by the bed every night; who knew that he would be sinking in the water at this moment, accompanying the cats and dogs he had killed before!</p>
<p>At this moment, he floated to the surface of the water again, and suddenly saw Knox's head, no more than three feet away from him. He also saw those clear brown eyes, earnestly staring at his face. He couldn't help but feel anxious in his heart, secretly thinking, "I usually abuse it, maybe it's here to retaliate against me." But he didn't care, because his body and mind had already suffered so much pain, and he was not afraid of any more pain being added to him. He just raised his eyes, intending to give his home a final look. Just then, a lark flew over, flying into the air, but Peng Qi sank into the water again.</p>

<h3>Introducing a Large Batch of New Performers to "Geng Xin" Stage (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I received a letter from Mei Hua Guan Zhu, the representative of "Geng Xin" Stage who went north to invite performers. He said that Gou Huisheng was temporarily unable to come south. The first batch of performers for the "Geng Xin" autumn opening has been confirmed, including female roles Wu Suqiu, Zhao Jinrong, Zhao Xiaolan, Li Yanxiu, as well as famous performers Chen Shaolin, Li Duokui, etc. Covering male, female, painted-face, and clown roles, every category is represented. The abundance of talent is no less than the golden period after the autumn cool. However, there are quite a few unfamiliar faces to Shanghai audiences, so I am introducing them as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu rose in the capital's opera scene in just a few years. Wu's art is not comparable to Zhao Jinrong and Hou Yulan who graduated from opera school, but her appearance is beautiful, and like Lu Sujuan, she is known for her beauty in the northern music scene, so she is also popular. Wu is a disciple of Gou Huisheng, and her outstanding works include Xun school operas such as "Xun Guan Niang" and "Hua Tian Cuo". She has been with Li Yuchun's Yongchun Troupe for a long time. Last year, she left Yongchun Troupe and signed with Zhang Yijun. This time, she resolutely accepted the invitation to "Geng Xin." This is her first time coming south. Seeing the popularity of Li Guiyun in Shanghai, Wu Suqiu will surely be very popular with Shanghai audiences.</p>
<p>Zhao Jinrong</p>
<p>Zhao Jinrong is a top student from the Beiping Opera School. The opera school has three outstanding female performers: Zhao Jinrong, Song Dezhu, and Hou Yulan. Among the three, Jinrong was the most popular when they were in school. Jinrong was the mainstay when the opera school performed in Ping. After Jinrong left the school, Dezhu succeeded her, and after Dezhu left, Yulan began to succeed Dezhu and solely take on the responsibility. Zhao Jinrong's performance has been passed down from famous performers such as Yu Yuqin and Wu Fuqin. She excels in both Qingyi (serious female role) and Huashan (vivacious female role), and her appearance is considered excellent, earning her the title of "Female Mei Lanfang." While in school, she, along with martial arts actor Wang Jinlu and bearded male actor Wang Rulin, formed a three-legged stool and were outstanding talents of the opera school. Her art is far above Hou Yulan. Since Yulan was able to become extremely popular in Shanghai, Jinrong's popularity can be expected without question. Although "Geng Xin" has invited as many as four female performers this time, in practical terms, only Jinrong is worth noting.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaolan</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaolan is a disciple of Shang Xiaoyun. She has come to Shanghai twice before, but she did not become popular either time. The year before last, she joined Zhou Xinfang's Yifeng Troupe, and gradually began to attract the attention of opera lovers, but soon after, she left Yifeng Troupe and returned north. Xiaolan's voice is excellent. However, she studied Shang's style too much, which backfired. It is said that Xiaolan is diligent in her studies. After returning to Ping, her artistic skills have improved greatly. A scholar who has been away for three days should be looked at with new eyes. Xiaolan's return this time may be able to refresh the ears and eyes of Shanghai audiences.</p>
<p>Li Yanxiu</p>
<p>Li Yanxiu is a rising star among female performers in the capital, and also a favorite disciple of Shang Xiaoyun. Li's art is comparable to Zhao Xiaolan's. Her high-pitched voice and agile martial arts skills are quite like her teacher. Although her qualifications and experience are not as good as Xiaolan, her talent is fully revealed. Her popularity in Ping is even greater than Xiaolan's. She has created many new operas, such as "Wang Juan Niang", "Jian Qi Yuan", and "Bi Yu Yuan", which have all been greatly appreciated by the general public. Her teacher, Xiaoyun, recently taught her plays such as "Bai Yu Lian" and "Hua Rui Furen". Yanxiu has established herself in Ping, performing at Qingleyuan. Her older sister, Yanbin, also performs female roles, privately studying Cheng Yanqiu's style. The two sisters are known as the "Li Sisters' Two Inkstones" in Ping. The "Geng Xin" invitation representative values her talent and invited her to come with Suqiu, Jinrong, and Xiaolan.</p>
<p>Chen Shaolin</p>
<p>Chen Shaolin is the son of the deceased famous performer Chen Delin. Shaolin studied under the famous performer Zhang Chunyan. Chunyan is one of the few talented performers in Liyuan (the opera world) today. With Yang Yan's superb drama skills, Shaolin's art is not ordinary. Shaolin once came to Shanghai with Cheng Yanqiu. At that time, Shaolin's art was still immature, so it failed to attract the attention of Shanghai audiences. Shaolin's singing and recitation are quite commendable, but his acting is too rigid and his eyes lack expression. In addition, his experience and insight are not enough. His art is slightly better than Guan Shaohua, who was invited to the Tianchan Stage last time. Shaolin has been away from Shanghai for three years. With Gao Shenglin's rapid progress, it is expected that Shaolin's art must be different from the past and must have improved.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Performing Arts Association Held its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>— Bi Hua</p>
<p>The Shanghai Performing Arts Association held its inaugural meeting at Shanghai Middle School, located at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road, at 10:00 am yesterday (the 19th). First, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Bangjun, Tao Leqin, and others gave speeches, followed by Zhang Ye'er, the chairman of the presidium, reporting on the preparations. There were more than 300 members present, gathering together, creating a lively atmosphere. At noon, the election began, and 15 directors were elected, namely Zhang Ye'er, Liu Ziyun, Li Zhuan, Shi Chunxuan, Hu Hensheng, Xiao Wenbin, Dong Quanmin, Huang Zhaolin, Chen Dabei, Jiang Xiaoxiao, Liu Minsheng, Yang Jingwen, Zhu Yaoxiang, Hu Junan, and Ni Gulian. Seven supervisors were elected, namely Zhang Xiaotian, Gu Jianqiu, Zhuang Haiquan, Tang Bihua, Wang Shaobai, Song Zhangqing, and Chen Hexuan. The association's purpose is pure and the methods are perfect. From now on, the city's performing arts community will be able to pool their efforts, support each other, study art, discuss knowledge, seek happiness for themselves, and contribute to the public good for society. The future is bright and unlimited. The meeting adjourned at approximately 2:00 pm after a group photograph.</p>
<p>Random Notes on Performers</p>
<h3>From Stage to Screen (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Silver Flute's Notes</p>
<p>—Oral Account by Ms. Yuan Meiyun—</p>
<p>The plan to go to Chongqing did not materialize, but we went to Hong Kong, which was the farthest "trip" in my life. We stayed in Hong Kong for more than two months, and took the opportunity to shoot a film called "Miss Tomboy," directed by Yue Feng. It was later distributed by Xinhua Film Company.</p>
<p>While in Hong Kong, Zhu Qingxian, the owner of Nanyue Film Company, asked me to join Nanyue and sign contracts for several films. While I was still considering, Mr. Zhang Shankun of Xinhua arrived in Hong Kong and asked me to return to my old ways, because Xinhua had resumed filming work in Shanghai. So, we finally returned to Shanghai. The contract with Xinhua Company was signed in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>After returning to Shanghai, I successively filmed four films with Xinhua and Huaxin (the two companies belong to the same system). Recently, we are starting to film "Xi Shi," and this is my first time playing a role in a historical costume drama.</p>
<p>Life in the film industry is not as comfortable as outsiders imagine. The hardships are sometimes unknown to outsiders. For example, when I was in Xinhua, I encountered three films being shot at the same time. "Sunrise" was filmed at the Datong Studio on Gansidong Road, while "Four Pan Jinlian" and "Tears of Love" were filmed at the Xinhua Factory on Albert Road. I had to rush to three locations in one day, and work from afternoon to dawn for more than ten days. No matter how strong a person is, they would not be able to withstand it, let alone me, who has always been weak. So, in addition to catching a cold, I also suffered from severe laryngitis. After consulting Dr. Mi Ziyun and taking seven or eight doses of medicine, I finally recovered.</p>
<p>Injuries during filming are common in film studios. Although I have been lucky, I did suffer a little bit when Yihua Company was filming "Little Sisters." Most film studios have a basement level. When filming "Little Sisters," it was a dark night. I went to the dressing room to change clothes and unfortunately stepped into the air, immediately falling from the ground into the basement, and fainting. The basement was full of nails and pieces of wood, so my knees were injured. Although it was not very serious, when I woke up after fainting, I felt very painful. At this time, I don't need to hide it, it was Wang Yin who jumped down from above and rescued me. —In the six years of filming, this was the only time I had an accident.</p>
<p>Regarding "ribbon-cutting," I need to make a statement here: In the past, I almost "granted every request" for ribbon-cutting, but it is really a "hard errand." If it is an orderly public place, it is fine, but otherwise I will inevitably suffer unexpected disasters. Like the opening of the Shanghai Yimiao Market on Luzon Road, I was greatly burdened. Because the audience was as surging as a tide, completely losing order, if Mr. Chen Kangran had not supported me, I would not have been able to breathe and would have fallen to the ground. Therefore, for the sake of "safety first," for ribbon-cutting, unless it is a charitable event, which is obligatory, otherwise I can only "decline from now on." This may offend people, but I hope people can understand my difficulties.</p>
