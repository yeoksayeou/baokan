<h3 id="c10">釋總反攻 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>旬餘以來，中國軍隊開始總反攻之訉，喧傳遐邇。據各方電傳：綏遠方面，華軍進襲百靈廟；山西方面，克夏縣，迫聞喜；山東方面，交綏於台兒莊；河南方面，克開封，圍信陽；江蘇方面，攻宜興；安徽方面，克宿縣；湖北方面，渡襄水，圍鍾祥洋梓暨平靖關；江西方面，爭持高安而迫武昌武寗；廣東方面，克花縣，圍增城；此皆一星期以來之戰績也。如此氣象，爲初期戰事中所不經見；是不僅華人欣然相告於總反攻之畢竟不凡，即友邦報紙亦多以爲數星期內將見全部改觀。夫抗戰閱二十一月，民心穩定，士氣旺盛，既顯示持久抗戰之絕對可能，且深信最後勝利之如操左券，自在遭逢大難之任何國家所難能而可貴；然希望及早戰勝，亦是情理之常；故自盛傳總反攻之後，繼之以各地捷音，更見生氣蓬勃矣。雖然，愛國之熱情，不以刺激而興奮；維繫熱情者，要在冷靜之理智。以我人所知所觀感，中國之總反攻，固當有待而未開始也。</p>
<p>中國制勝之道有二，日本之內潰，其一也。內潰有三方式：一爲軍民心理之衰頹，由厭戰而至於反戰之表面化行動化；二爲公私經濟之枯竭，內而百業破產，稅源盡絕，社會動搖，政府解體，外而餉糈不繼，兵不用命；三爲軍事方面，軍略之失敗，軍器之消耗，軍紀之墮落。三者有其一，即無以繼續其侵略行爲，而敗亡隨之；於是中國勝。中國之强健，其二也。換言之，卽不待日本之內潰，而中國方面由軍隊之訓練，軍器之充實，實力增强。克摧勁敵；於是一聲總反攻，而掃蕩外寇，光復河山。於是言之，中國之制勝，期待於對方之內潰者三，期待於本身之加强者一；亦即期待制勝於總反攻，僅爲期待中之一端而已，並非惟一之期待也。</p>
<p>謂內潰在彼，加强自我，是惟應求之在我。此乃最克己之說，默察初期抗戰以迄今茲，中國當局最所致力者，亦確乎在斯。以我人所聞，關於軍隊，前綫之補充，固儘所必要而補充之；而於新軍之編練，則儘所可能而編練之；是以實際力量之發揮於前綫者，並非力量之最高度，其蘊蓄於後方者，蓋爲不盡不竭之主力也。關於軍器：中國承歷年內亂之後，軍隊皆由濫招粗編而成，有槍有彈便是兵，聚兵便成隊成軍，故愴與彈之外，幾無所謂軍器；其有較周備者，少數部隊而已，編練標準而已；在抗戰開始之前無幾時，始謀軍器之充實；及今兩年，新軍器與重軍器陸績輸入，其積爲雄偉之力量，以及運用之熟練，俱非一蹴可幾，然確能與日俱進，更經若干月，可以大成。軍隊訓練完畢，軍器充實大成，始可以總反攻而操必勝，此所謂求之在我者也。期不在遠。顧非今茲。</p>
<p>抑所謂內潰在彼，其實促之使潰者，其事猶在此而不在彼。彼經中國廿一閱月之抗戰，雖迄未崩潰，然無論在心理上，經濟上，軍事上，早已向崩潰之途而兼程邁進。遠者不具論，即如華軍退出武漢之後，日本經四閱月之休息與調整，乃以莫大之犧牲而得一南昌；彼所犧牲者如付東流，彼所進展者無關宏旨，更以空間與時間比例之，其勢蓋如强弩之末，遠非初期侵略之比矣。自其頹勢以迄內潰，其間猶有距離；而最近中國軍隊在各地所取之行動，即求所以短縮此距離。在此行動之下，戰績有如上述，是誠可喜；然價値不在乎克復與進展，而在乎使彼不能安守，不能靜止；使彼消耗之不已，疲乏之不已。夫如是者，彼之內潰愈速，而中國方面取得必勝之總反攻之機運亦愈近。克復與進展以及總反攻，皆富有刺激之言辭；然在此際，與其謂需刺激，母寗謂需忍苦痛，忍犧牲之最大決心，需出錢出力之最大貢獻！</p>

<h3 id="c43">蘇聯重定新政策（續） <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 特也</p>
<p>依賴國家主義—不重協定—</p>
<p>蘇聯對戰爭的能力</p>
<p>八月間與日軍的衝突，雙方用兵各一師團之衆，遠東紅軍會奉莫斯科的訓令，在嚴格有限制的陣線作戰，而向世界表示蘇聯「永不退讓一吋自己的土地。」這次示威，雖覺壯觀，但就拯救捷克的觀察點而論，純粹是虛有其表的。</p>
<p>蘇聯如和德國開戰，波瀾無論如何，必頑固地保守中立，而成兩國間的一道「中國長城。」羅馬尼亞呢，即使羅政府願許蘇聯軍隊假道，而就戰略興軍需供給立塲觀之，卻無大用，所以在最初階段中，蘇聯軍隊的活動，必僅以長程轟炸，（因為捷克的地位不能替紅空軍備有根據點，）並以潜艇在波羅的海巡弋，而襲擊敵艦為限。但蘇聯如願意的話，必能在稍後的階段中調出大軍，因為在大戰之中，變化不測，當會　通進兵大道。</p>
<p>互助協定，始終有名無實，不過是外交折衡中的回合而已。雙方的參謀部並未有過嚴重的會談，所以危機降臨之時，駐莫斯科的法國代辦，和捷克公使，甚至捷克公使館的軍事委員，無一得到關於紅軍準備作何行動的明白解釋。</p>
<p>蘇聯對英國的態度　蘇聯政府深知法國無意為了捷克開　和希特勒開戰，面英國也必如此，所以便堅決議在初步中陌　目內瓦的正當　　取　　、　　此　繼諾夫會兩次在目內瓦宜布蘇聯決議以當前所有的種種方法履行她在蘇　協定下擔任的義務，這當然是必須法國盡其和捷克同盟的責任，攻擊德國，然後蘇聯才能這樣幹哩。在蘇聯的觀念中，捷克現在已成為德國的一個目鵠，在需要時能夠供給希特勒十個師團。大勢已去，所有蘇聯對待西方民治國的態度，現已冷如寒泉了。布兩希維克切齒於張伯倫，認他為查理斯王的頭覻，較前更甚，蘇聯的報紙都小覷英國的努力，他們仍如常態，詳論歐洲的事變，大似蘇聯是別立在一個行星之上。莫斯科當局認德國下次的施擊，必施於西方，他們主要的注意，是在日本的危齊，各軍事學校目下都在沉靜地受一種教訓。「春季中的戰爭。」</p>
<p>東歐各國趁機觀變</p>
<p>若干英國報紙，會倡蘇德「行將親善」之說，這使神經不寗的東歐，甚受損害，這種策略，徒能有益於希特勒。假使德國放鬆她武裝的進取，準備以半經工作的材料供給蘇聯的軍火廠，蘇聯準備分重要的原料供給德國，於是落至希特勒時代前七分之一的蘇德貿易，可以大大恢復。但無論蘇聯如何歡迎外交上的緊張化為和緩，而親善卻是另一事件。民治國的政治家都不能了解蘇德兩國主義的抵觸，須知道不是僅僅忠貞問題，卻是根本組織問題，兩國的組織，向來是針鋒相對的。蘇聯深知希特勒對各方面都有　　，德國經濟的困難不久必迫希特勒向或一方面活躍。</p>
<p>決蘇協定，法國說铀「目下正在消毒之中，」其　固　，但這個協定還不能算是死物，目下正在用微妙的催眠方法使她不絕地微微喘息著。</p>
<p>東　各國間的關係，似乎仍如前狀，很難捉摸，非等到看見「國粹貓」向那方面跳躍，因此能夠表明目前德國在東歐所作的「貓行」外交手段，究竟是怎麼一回事，沒有一國願意作肯定的主張。但東歐各都城和莫斯科間，目下正在交換和標榜友好的姿勢，蘇聯和黑海濱各國間且會互相探詢缔結「黑海公約」的可能性，迄今絕少成績，非至保加利亞加入巴兩幹集團，這個公約是難望告成的。</p>
<p>波蘭因希特勒提出「下加巴阡島克蘭」人種的怪論，（該地其實多由原始的「大俄羅斯」人民居住，）一怒之下，便促成蘇波兩國間的重要貿易協定。波瀾報紙前對蘇聯常作惡意的辱駡，今已轉為恭維「蘇聯的人力和礦產，是取之不竭，用之不盡」的。蘇聯的報紙卻緘默不發議論。波瀾人是輕率尚武的，現在似乎將視命運之所許，在他的世仇德國和舊主人蘇聯中間無險可守的平原上觀望形勢。倘若謹慎地傾向蘇聯的波瀾長此保守中立，德國攻入蘇維埃島克蘭的企圖，一時必難實現，可是。希特勒如果肯聽那精明的德國軍需長的話，德國也許會山羅馬尼亞的狹頸攻入蘇維埃島克蘭。</p>
<p>紅軍清黨已收實效</p>
<p>希特勒的島克蘭政策，迄未實施，「部份或由於審慎計謀有已致之，他似乎盼望蘇聯內的非俄羅斯種族的人民被他的種族的主義」宜傳誘動，便會脫離蘇聯而獨立。希特勒抱此幻想，卻漠視了十餘種相反的因素，甚至最近的一件要事，他也熟視無睹，那便是史丹林已在一九三七至三八年間大舉清黨之際，先發制人，把蘇維埃共和聯邦中非俄羅斯種族的領袖全行剷除，至此，希特勒從能巧言如簧，也難償願了。</p>
<p>紅軍清黨運動，現在已成過去之事，除遠東還有白魯轍上將，因為素學衆望，仍居高位外，其餘各地的將士，都不再以清黨自危。這次宣讀新誓詞的將士，至少有兩百萬人。不但宣讀，還須署名，這已證明發號施令者和簽署誓詞者都知簽名的誓詞有不可思議的重要性。這並可以最近政府所發確認上年擢陞最高指揮的將領五十六人的新職位命令證明的，自一九三七年杜加契夫斯基上將處決后，政府發這種命令還是初次哩。</p>
<p>蘇聯的陸軍，現正在整個強化中，每月有幾個新師團加入實力。迫近西部邊陲一帶，駐有軍械齊備的師團四十上下。邊陲和內地的交通不便，以及無彈力的戰爭勢能，這兩項仍將為蘇聯主要的弱點。但是當局已為此在邊陲附近囤積足供多月需用的軍需，並且在三個月內能容易調齊每師團萬人的正規軍一百師團集中在西陲。蘇聯對於軍略，現正回復「集合大團」的概念，清黨中或會喪失的個體的光榮，大約現在用「集團的光榮」彌補這個犧牲。外人常常鄙笑康拉德氏（波瀾貴族，平生厭惡俄人，）所稱俄國徒恃人數的「犬儒主義，」（意即目空一世者）俄人也會自己時常招此鄙笑，尤其是一九〇三至〇四年和日本交戰大敗之前，俄人會誇口道：「我們將把敵軍悶死在俄軍帽子之下。」但是俄人「集合大團」的天性，確是他們的一個特長點。現在，蘇聯軍隊已備了現代的武器，加上經過嶄新的社會組織，他們希望在需要時能夠悶死「敵軍，」比以前更有把握。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c47">教長陳立夫論　音樂在教育上地位　策勵靑年使其循之邁進 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）教育部長陳立夫氏、頃撰文論音樂在教育上的地位、原文如下、</p>
<p>教育之標的、在於以德智體三育、培養靑年、使進而達此使命、則不容諱言、所成就者、不必為致用之才、所致力者不必為有用之學、其原因則在以習靜之功代習動、耗實行之力於學文、其癥結則一言以蔽之曰、音樂在教育上失其地位、</p>
<p>我國歷史上、數文教昌明之時期、必曰成周、論師表百世之聖人、必曰孔子、成周之教、則建國之學政、掌於禮樂、孔子之教、則施教之學科、先以六藝、而泰伯篇有一「與於詩立於禮成於樂」之說、則樂又為教育之所由完成、綜合觀之、則當時音樂在教育上地位之重要、可以推見、</p>
<p>秦漢以後、古樂失傳、而禮教單於世、其流弊則重行式而輕實用、偏保守而怠進取、馴至禮教亦僅存形式、於是禮壞樂崩、立國之基礎因之動搖、國民之性能因而低落、輕實用則利用厚生之科學、新知即無由產生、舊學亦久而喪失、怠進取則民族漸趨衰老、社會亦呈暮氣、以開化最早、歷史悠久之國家、遂轉而事事落後、百凡退化、其尤可痛心者、則萎靡·散漫·淩雜·放僻、種種不良現象、弱點曅呈、而國民道德、澌滅無餘、使五千年號稱禮樂之邦、幾於國將不國、</p>
<p>故今日謀挽救國家民族之危機、不可不恢復音樂在教育上的地位、原樂之為用、在於利導靑年蓬勃之生機、而完成之於集體動作之內、鐘磐之音金石不同、而能和諧於律呂、千羽之舞、文武異致、而得進退之整齊猶之靑年之個性、雖復不同、而人盡其才、則不妨合作於集團生活之內、樂主於動、動則發展之功多、禮主於靜、靜則安定之力學、過去教育之畸形發展、不患其不能靜、而患其不能動、故當以音樂之發揚蹈厲、振其萎靡行列整齊薬其散漫、進退齊一、理其淩雜、安樂中和、正其放僻、庶幾由習動習慣之養成、引起實用科學之愛好、以實用科學之發達、培育進取精神之產生、以謀恢復國民固有之道德、與迎頭趕上日新月異之知能、</p>
<p>抗戰已二十個月、勝利之把握日增、國際之情形好轉、由國民之互信、而堅定民族之自信、由民族之自信、而增進友邦之共信、則團結精神之發達、實為第一要義、音樂之用、所以親附萬民、蓋其感人也至深、而其道則出於自然、故一唱百合、能於潛移默運之中、收聲應氣求之效、而鼓舞人心、激昂士氣、堅其同仇敵忾之忠、作其殺敵致果之勇、亦為戰時之迫切需要、馬賽曲於法蘭西革命之成功、影響不小、此其明效可睹者也、故應戰時之需要、音樂教育、亦不可不急為提倡、</p>
<p>故樂教盛而成周之交教昌明、樂教衰而民族之危機日丞、因果互異、其事　然、教育　之軌道、而策勵靑年、使其循之邁進、則音樂實為之動能、審於是、則音樂再教育上的地位不待繁言矣、</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩、）初間聞美滙潛勢穩中帶軟、且港帮買意蓬勃、加以某金號亦代厦門帮跟踪吸購、故賣方扳價吐售、九時五十分、首由某銀樓（代港帮進同業及金號各五十兩、均二千○六十七元、為開盤價、較之前收做高三元、開後某金號進銀樓帮百兩、價與晨開相同、繼之現金號相同價亦進銀樓帮百兩、後某銀樓又進金號百兩、價仍六十七元、銀樓帮又售予金號五十兩、亦為六十七元、此後錢兌業互做五十兩、高至六十九元、某銀樓又進同業五十兩、價則相同、未幾某銀樓再進錢兌業百兩、為六十八元、及六十七元、後余號賣予銀樓帮五十兩、亦六十七元、近午銀樓帮又售予錢兌業五十兩六十八元、為午收價、午後因買方止進觀望、且錢兌業續來拋塞、遂轉下疲、唯交易極淸、僅在二時三刻見錢兌業賣予銀樓帮五十兩、價六十四元、此後未見做閒、故晚收仍為二千○六十四元、結果較隔昨晚收未分榮辱、全天五元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千○七十元、收進二千○六十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金改懸二百十元</p>

<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期仍平、遠期長一二五、紐約銀價呆定如故、倫敦生金漲半便士、滙兌英對美小六毫、對滬勿動、對法跌四生丁、美對英降○六二五、對滬未更對法大○六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開賣價英滙八便士二五、美匯十六元○六二五、較之隔晚收盤均平、開後香港來電、突購英塞美、合套英美滙兌價為四元六角八分○一毫、外行滙豐麥加利塞予港電（套滙兌）印商銀公司及洋行等英匯八便士二五、為狀乏變、　豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、仍微百分之力·○○、此後外銀行對於美滙賣意頗淡、一度難結、但不久港電與大津帮互相拋塞、故遂回平、港電（套滙兌）與有利（代天津帮）及荷蘭賣予印商銀公司及洋行美滙十六元○六二五、是以形勢平穩、將近午時、錢兌業售予外行安達、荷蘭港滙五十六元一二五、狀况亦平、迨午收銀行賣價英滙八便士二五、美滙十六元○六二五、港滙五十六元、</p>
<p>後市成交轉淸、祇洋行略有結款、於是情况愈穩、洋行結進酒豐八便士二五、而美匯則未聞做開、價仍穩定、最後華行互做港匯五十六元一二五、迨晚收銀行賣價英滙八便士二五、美匯十六元○六二五、港滙五十六元、結果較之前收、英美兩滙、仍未分軒輊、而港滙則回緊一二五、</p>

<p>紗市依然靜而謐、且氣勢前進、良以華南需要日見起色、因之市上籌碼充足之二十支雙馬紗轉趨緊俏之狀矣、至於華北一路十支粗紗交易亦奇健、且有吃不飽滿之象、實則貨物缺乏、現貨商居奇允烈、市態愈形挺進、三二支·四二支單紗及雙股綫價異常穩定、蓋以廠方生產薄弱之故也、又有人說、十支粗紗價比上年歲暮價已漲起二十元以外、二十支紗價反跌十元、目前南方實需起色、二十支紗當能提升一步、如果客銷接踵而來、復達四百元關口、亦有此可能性、午後因環境順遂、殷富團戶復來收藏、市氣更形挺括云、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、市况尙平、因散戶稍有賣出、開價勿動、二十支雙馬紗仍做三百九十二元、旋以香港潮汕帮對於二十支雙馬·天女採辦紛繁、徐徐而升、且市面穩中帶緊、雲南帮有一部份獲利吐出略疲、然不足以影響市塲、迨至收盤允昂一步、二十支雙馬現貨價為三百九十四元、午後市象更挺秀、雙馬紗再漲一元半、為三百九十五元半、天女價做到三百九十七元、但廠方乘漲時復出遠月份貨、結果各帮買去統計二千八百九十包、行情二十支天女雙馬均漲二二二元、粗紗亦漲二三元、廠方開出甚巨、永安廠開出二十支特金城一千五百包、五月份價為三百九十五元、德豐廠開出十六支變獅一百包、價為三百六十元、安達廠開出二十支飛虎二百包、價為三百八十八元、十支飛虎一百包、價為三百零五元、四五月期、永安廠開出十支特令城五十包、價為三百二十七元、信和廠開出二十支五子一百五十包、價為三百七十七元至八十元、以上各廠開出共計二千一百包、接受者每包付定洋四十元（現鈔）、今日出口棉紗有四百七十件運汕頭、一百九十件運香港、三百六十件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>日紗市面、亦見昂升、因根子緊迫、加之大戶在多頭地位、市象甚挺　實則則該項棉紗、北路消費既浩大、而游擊區中亦不弱也、二十支水月紗價在三百六十元外、二十支藍鳳紗價在三百五十九元云、</p>

<p>本棉生意之寂寞、猶似晨星、各廠皆無動辦觀念、實則邇來海外棉市、頻頻下降、換算價愈趨愈廉矣、故廠方目標、傾向在美棉上着想、至本棉應有下跌之慮、然存貨既薄、而來源又受某方統制之影響、所以處於尷尬之境、昨則售價稍形回挫矣、蘇北來源亦滯、碼頭上到通州花僅四百五十一包、茲將統棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市殊呈疲乏、華盛頓方面對於貸款棉雖尙無解決方法、唯對於各種辦法正在考慮中、尤以輸出及津貼等問題極為重視、此乃貸款棉唯一之放出辦法也「數日來孟買帮在紐約為主要賣戶、粽覜棉市、今可入暫定狀態、」二日內或能略見回好、唯將來局勢、下跌仍屬常事也、昨紐約跌十餘磅昔、印度連同預測跌半羅比　埃及跌二十磅音滙兌無甚軒輊、折合法幣、棉價俱跌、計美棉及巴西棉每擔跌八角、卬棉跌二角、埃及跌一元六角餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易　漸形活躍、唯仍無大宗交易、近日中新開出棉紗甚多、對於原棉略有抵進、昨日計進印棉三百件、巴西五百件、其他各廠均無交易日廠方面、靜寂已有多日良以棉額早已配備矣、茲將昨日外棉期貨即裝折合送廠價、計算如下、</p>

<p>新聞社、偽「上海市警察局」秘書主仟吳縣洞庭山人席時泰於本月十一日上午九時十五分、在勞合路居易里六號門口被人槍殺斃命、當時有路人溧陽人彭福林（二十三歲）一名、亦被流彈擊傷胸部、彭即自投實隆醫院求治、詛因傷重、延至昨晨二時左右在院殞命、屍體已送騐屍所檢騐、同時昨日本埠各日文報均載稱彭係殺席者之一、當時同往狙擊者有五人之多、且由其中之主腦人物名袁得昌者在旁指揮、袁則為浦東游擊隊中之中堅人物、至當時伴送彭至醫院之彭弟名金夏及彭友趙志祥及另一陳姓、均為參加殺席之人云云、此說迄今尙不能證實、</p>

<p>不無關係　、昨日對報界雖未給予確切情報、惟記者得悉該傷者確曾聞槍擊傷一華捕、而華捕於追逐逃逸之恐怖份子時、間槍射擊、亦擊傷其中一人、兩嫌疑犯身畔、均未抄出軍器、故衆信至少必另有一人與此案有關、同時、警務處槍彈專家縝密檢騐由席氏屍體取出之槍彈、發現此决</p>

<p>— 丁濟民</p>
<p>現在社會上似乎已成了一種風氣，不論何人，想進補品，總要說每天弄點牛乳鷄汁牛肉汁吃吃，榮養不良的人，到醫生那裹，總是勸他吃點牛乳鷄汁牛肉汁，西醫當然是這樣說，中醫近來亦不能例外。尤其是牛乳一物，在食養品中，便佔了一個很重要的位置。</p>
<p>牛乳的營養價値，在中醫方面，本草綱月上面載得很明白，現節錄如下：</p>
<p>牛乳（氣味）甘微寒，無毒（主治）補虛贏，止渴。（別錄）養心肺，解熱毒，潤皮膚。（日華）冷補，下熱氣，和蒜煎沸食，去冷氣痃癖。（藏器）患熱風人宜食之。（孟銑）老人煮食有益，人姜葱止小兒吐乳，補癆。（思邈）治反胃熱噦，補益勞損，潤大陽，治氣痢，除疸黃，老人煮粥甚宜。（時珍）</p>
<p>西醫所發表的營養成份如下：</p>
<p>牛乳　水份87.2，蛋白質3.5，脂肪3.7，炭水化物4.9，灰分0.7，維他命甲乙丙均有。</p>
<p>我們拿上面中西翳的解釋看起來，牛乳的確是一件好東四，所以怪不得中西醫家，都要介紹牠給病人吃。然而據我的經騐，有些病人吃了固然很見效騐，但有些病人吃了，却依然故我，甚至還有少數病人初吃了要吐，（大多數是老太太們）有的吃了口臭，有的吃了腹瀉不等。許多病人都對我說：牛乳性質太熱。牛乳性質究竟是不是熱的？這是大多數人要問的一個問題，所以我不嫌嚕囌的寫一些在下面：</p>

<p>食足則飽、食不足則飢，此盡人而知者矣。但飢而飽，飽而飢，又屬何義乎，夫人類之以以攝食也，貧者之言曰我因飢餓而不得已也，富者之言曰我因口福而為享受也。但就醫學而論，飲食之目的，在補充人體因生活而需要之營養素，其間固無貧富之分也。但若消化機能不健全，不能分泌精微以奉血液，則口納雖多且美，於身體營養仍無裨益，同時糟粕不能排出體外，因飲食或停滯腸胃，腹滿便結，濁氣薰蒸，人體不得其益而反受其害，反之，飲食雖少而消化正常，精微則足以補充全體營養之需，糟粕則能及時排出體外，是飲食之日的已達，較之飽食多珍而消化不良者，固有益而無損。此即筆者所謂飢而飽飽而飢之義。前者飲食雖多而營養缺乏，故調之飽而飢；後者飲食雖少，而營養充分，故謂之飢而飽也。</p>
<p>飢飽之感覺又為我人保持消化正常之自然良能，蓋我人飢感之所以發生，由於胃中空虛，飽感之所以發生由於胃中飽滿（因病而致反常者自屬例外）是以飢則食飽則不食，庶能令胃部之消化常能維持正常。世唯有因經濟限制而致絕食者，而未聞老饕家目睹美餐，食指大動，力慮不能消化而臨時加以尅制，故飽食之病常多，講究飲食衛生者豈不常善從此自然良能之指揮，以保全其健康之身體乎？</p>
<p>諺有曰「若要小兒安，常帶三分飢和寒，」其實成人進食，又何嘗不須「寗稍飢，母過飽，」俾雖飢而飽，以免飽而實飢之議也。</p>
<h3 id="c119">貝類食品 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣鑑初</p>
<p>貝類食品在國人之心目中，素視為佐餐飲酒之菜肴，以為毫無滋養價値者，此誠誤矣。蓋貝類食品雖較諸魚肉為賤，然細考其所含營養成分，則反較之為多。在歐美日本諸國，向極重視，每取其汁製為成藥，專治肺癆及發育不全諸症。在吾國廣東各地，亦有用以治癆之俗。</p>
<p>吾人常見之貝類，有蝦，蟹，蛤，螺，牡蠣等，前四者之滋養份較遜，而以牡蠣為最佳。</p>
<p>牡蠣又名蠣黃，粵人稱為『蠔』其油曰蠔油”牡蠣味鹹性微寒，食其殼內之肉，能補虛止汗，治瘧除驚，營衛虛熱。對於漏血遺精各症，亦能治之。其最著之特效，為善治老年痰積及久咳氣喘。並能補肺，故對於病後虛弱者，均為適宜之食品。</p>
<p>能應注意一點：即此物之肉不易消化。故消化不良者不宜多食。而烹調時，宜用文火久煮，方可得益也。</p>
<h3 id="c120">頭暈 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒德民</p>
<p>眩暈，乃肝病也。即頭目震眩不定，身不自主，甚覺屋轉地動，跌仆昏厥。輕者在短時間內自定，重者須數日而始愈。考其起病原因雖夥，而以血虛肝火上升者居多。婦人多於男子，老年多於靑年。四時中則以春令為甚。即舊有眩暈宿恙，在此陽氣升張之時，亦易復發也。</p>
<p>當發病時，宜服藥調冶，洽得其法，一二劑可愈。若欲澈底根治，平時須注車攝養，曠情怡性，快樂心志，擇其所好者為之。辛辣刺激性品，在所必禁。除服藥外，可用桑葉（炒枯）黑芝蔴（炒熟）各若干，研粉加糖，半飢時當點心食之，味極香甜可口，功能去風，凉血袖肝，益腎，據經騐所得，治血虛肝旺之眩暈症，具有特效，此乃寓藥餌於食養之中，常服不間，獲效必偉。古方有扶桑丸之配合，亦正同一轍也。（父菊花泡茶亦有小效，常食胡桃肉，勿多煩心，勿常居屋頂太低之屋中。）</p>
<h3 id="c121">烘山芋 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 葉勁秋</p>
<p>如果有一對十足道地的摩登靑年男女，在高級電影院裏的座位上，捧着烘山芋啃，那末一定能够吸住隣座的視綫，是可以預言的。如果宴請嘉賓的筵席上，安放着幾枚烘山芋，那末這位主人翁定會遭到寒酸氣的批評，也是可以預言的。然而却錯了！烘山芋這一種東西香甜兼備；既適口，又充腸；價廉物美四字，可當之無愧。、它並不是裝扮不出的蠢姑娘，只要剥去它外面的粗服，細膩潔白的膚色，觸到人們的眼裹，立刻興起無限的快感。洋化的括上一些白脫油，土氣的加些熬熟生猪油，趁着熱氣奔放的當兄，一口口往嘴裏送，就是飢腸末曾轆轆的，也會垂涎欲滴呢。况且它又含有褪其充分的營養價値與醫療作用。可是如果眞的有位大醫生，規規矩矩的藥方上，用上幾許山芋等作為藥引子，這位翳生就難免遭到不倫不類的譏評，也是可以預言的。它究竟怎樣會遭到這般難堪的歧視呢？大槪第一是價錢賣得太便宜，第二是外表太難看。其實它的功效却眞不小呢！「診餘集」上「有病脾洩便溏日久，服藥無效。後有一醫，傳一方云：以山芋一個，的半斤，用黃土調爛包好，置灶內煨熟，去泥去皮食之。每一個，依法行之，的食三四月，而脾氣已健，大便亦堅·」（下略）這就可見一斑了。</p>

<h3 id="c130">山西的游擊戰 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>本季山西的游擊戰，我們時常可以在報上看見牠的熱鬧，因为重慶，垣曲，興集，乃至北平，關於牠的電報是時常有得發表的。不過這些電報，總是簡短的，略陳其大槪的，使我們看不淸牠的全貌，究竟怎樣，因此，也可以說，有些美中不足。</p>
<p>好了，現在由山西某地，有路透社特派員發來的詳細專電了。這眞給了我們很大的欣喜，很大的安慰！欣喜的是我們得知了這些消息，安慰的是那方面的游擊戰，竟有這樣的成功！</p>
<p>到目前為止，我們已經看到這樣的電報好幾通。歸納起來，有下列各要點，値得我們注意：</p>
<p>（一）日軍攻佔的城池，一無所用，非但不能藉以為根據地，四出肆暴，反而成了處鱉之甕，使他們束手待捉。他們吃了幾次虧，以致不敢再去攻佔，游擊戰確實發生了莫大的效用。我想全國各地都能如此，敵人的消滅，何難之有！</p>
<p>（一）我軍自製的軍火，竟有這樣的妙用，那樣的充足，那宋，即使將來國際路綫果眞被截斷，外來接濟不能到達，也就一毫不足担憂了。可見天無絕人之路，諸事都在人為，只要有了需要肯努力設法，總是可以解決的。</p>
<p>（一）　各該地的民衆，已經完全動員，和其他的抗戰勇士，打成一片。這也是別的地方所不及的。我們早就知道，這次抗戰，是全民抗戰，可是別的地方，實行得多少總有些欠缺，沒有這些地方來得完備，徹底，我們別的地方正該以此為借鏡。</p>
<p>（一）日人的破壊工作，當然無所不用其極，而該特派員所認為可慮的，是日幣和日貨的搗亂，也許會引起困難。我希望該方面的當局者，倘能嚴加注意，一方面使他們無所施其技，一方面會供給民衆的正當需要。</p>
<p>這幾個要點，大都是給予我們安慰的。末了一點，我想在賢明的當局之下，困難總也容易克服吧。</p>
<p>在這第二期抗戰中，本來游擊戰仍居於主要的地位，所以我特為提出山西的游擊戰事，請我們全國同胞注意；同時，我也希望我們的新聞記者，也會有這樣詳盡的電報發來，更加增添我們的欣喜與安慰。</p>
<h3 id="c131">媽兒倆 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>剛丟下飯碗，大麻子家媽兒倆又在矮屋裹鬭嘴啦。</p>
<p>『該死，眞該死！』恕保叔公敲敲早烟桿，伸出像柴枝般的手，抹掉那染在鬍髭上的粥湯，嘴癯一癟說：『這樣個勢口，還鬧死鬧活的鬧些什麼來着，飯還弄不到嘴，就有閑勁兒鬧，唉，唉！』他一邊在掏那已經空了的旱烟袋，一邊在嘆息。</p>
<p>恕保叔婆在屋簷下拆破襪，把襪紗抽出來打成團，見恕保叔公坐在門檻上嘆氣，掉轉臉去瞟了他一眼：『老東西，少管人家閑事，自家管好了吧，旱烟少吃幾筒不會死。不聽見挑雜貨担兒的王二說嗎，上城裏批點貨色受盡那些鬼子兵的氣，只差沒把頭上的氈帽除下，就給打得牙縫裏冒血，腰眼裹還被吃上兩槍柄。他賭咒不進城了，把底貨賣掉，寗可餓死在家裏，就敎你有錢也買不到烟吃。』她狠毒地說着。</p>
<p>『看這批惡鬼鬧到那一天……』恕保叔公掃興地接一句口。</p>
<p>可是矮屋裏大麻子家媽兒倆格外鬧的厲害啦，咒駡，號哭和摔破碗的聲音都先後傳了過來。剛才還敎恕保別管閑事的恕保叔婆，她却丟下破襪和綫團，第一個先跑到矮屋裏去。嘴裏還嚕囌着：『唉鬧，鬧，鬧翻天還是媽兒倆……鬧出什麼油水來…』</p>
<p>恕保叔婆正要跨進矮屋的門檻，大麻子的兒子却拚命地打屋子裏竄出來，後面追着的正是大麻子的老婆，臉色氣得白裏泛靑，氣急喘喘，手裏揑着一根門閂，顯然是要追打她的兒子。恕保叔婆眼快手快，一把把她拉住說：『幹嗎啦，發這樣大的脾氣，息息吧。媽兒倆有什麽天大的事，總好商酌你家大麻子死後，就留下他這寳貝種，又沒多兒多女在那裏。』</p>
<p>『叔婆，你放我，呃。今天我非要把他打個半死不可，他這忤逆種，他眼睛裏還有我這個媽嗎！』大麻子老婆一時消不掉這口氣憤。</p>
<p>恕保叔婆好容易把她帶勸帶拖的拖到自家門口來，端一張板櫈給她坐下。『嘿嘿，大麻子家，這勢日甚麽可都只能馬虎些兒。』恕保叔公抹抹鬍髭打門檻上站起來，這麽說着。</p>
<p>「不瞞叔公叔婆說，別的我都肯依他，只有這件事不答應！』大麻老婆子咬咬牙齒，樣子很堅決。恕保叔婆搶先的問：『究竟是什麽一回兒事呵？』大麻子老婆『哼』了一聲，就說上一長串：</p>
<p>『什麽一回兒事！他要去帮鬼子兵做小工呵，修汽車路！你道他的良心好不好，大麻子是在汽車路旁邊給鬼子兵一槍打死的，沒緣沒故，死得多可憐：躺在溝灘沿，腦壳給打的粉碎，血往溝裏倘，腦漿往溝裏淌，那時鬼子兵剛到，白天沒人敢去收屍，叔公叔婆都知道，還是夜裏請祠堂裏的江北佬偷去拖回來：他這忤逆種，不是瞎掉眼睛沒看見，現在他不想給爹報仇，反要去給鬼子兵做小工。哼，掙錢！千萬兩銀子也不在乎，寗可餓死，可不許他去掙血錢……我要他去看看他爹：大麻子的屍首…』她說到這裏，聲音抖得不能再說下去了，她故聲大哭了。</p>
<p>恕保叔公也聽得不服氣，把早烟桿往石板上一敲，要去村上找大麻子的兒子來訓誡。『我們村子上不許誰做漢奸！』他一邊自言自語地。</p>

<p>可是死，也有着燦爛的光輝，被人歌頌着，被人讚美着，牠有着驚人的光芒。</p>
<p>這是最壯烈的史劇，為了解放，為了自由，造成了這個死。</p>
<p>這個死，替活的世界上驅逐鬼怪，為生的人類修築公理。</p>
<p>榮譽的死在歌唱着：「這不是那平凡的死，這是生，沒有黑暗；這千萬個死，造成這個世界的光明！」</p>
<p>死在烈火中出現了，那一陣雄偉的吶喊，驚醒了一切的人們！</p>
<p>死在血泊中出現了，牠帶着美麗的笑，嚇退了全人類的仇敵！</p>
<p>死，勇敢的死，偉大的死！</p>
<p>我們且不替死者流淚，或是憐惜，更不用默靜，替他哀禱！</p>

<p>— 電長</p>
<p>戰士·才子·貓·老人篇。</p>
<p>現在已經是春天了。是啊，牠會帶來了溫暖，舒適，蓬勃，生命之活力。我們歡喜春天，但常常有溫暖，蓬勃，生命之活力。春或許有牠底誘惑性，然而決不能使英勇的理智的戰士苦悶，懊惱，煩躁，雖然冰天雲地中的他們在春天是更活躍了起來，持續着更厲害的鬥爭，雪萊說：「如果冬天到了，春天還會遠嗎？」對了，就是這個春天。</p>
<p>「暮春三月，江南草長；雜花生樹，羣鶯亂飛。」這原是春天之現象，但還不曾把握了春天底豐富的意義。我們愛江南，也愛江北，愛長草，愛雜花，也愛白山，愛黑水，甚至愛冰雪，愛風雨，愛霰雹，愛雷電，祖國的大地到處是溫暖着的，有牠底香味，就使不在春天。在春天裏，我們更表露着偉大的愛，所有的永遠是更大的力，我們永遠在發揚着堅强的戰鬥底威力呢。</p>
<p>在或種才子底感覺裏，春天是會變成懶洋洋和死纏綿的：「良辰美景奈何天，賞心樂事誰家院，」這不是兒女底春天的煩惱嗎？「萬金寳劍藏秋水，滿馬春愁壓繡鞍，」那原是工愁善病的英雄式的春天的性之苦悶啊。普天之下的風流才子也不少，「流水落花春去也，天上人間。」正是沒落前的斷腸聲，「留待心魂在，殘軀討刦灰；靑燐火不減，夜夜照燕台！」「少年頭」呢，在春天失節者不免要暗暗發洩一下的，雖然依然那麼遮遮掩掩的一副。</p>
<p>我們來謳歌春天之力的偉大罷，即使或種人不敢正視。</p>
<p>今年的春天底襲來帶着肅殺，冷酷，我們却更用着悲壯而愉快的心來撫摩着牠，然後讓牠悠悠地飛掠過去：明年的春天還要來呢！</p>
<p>不錯，要來的，明年的春天。但即令是春天吧，凄寒的白骨上也不會長出花兒來的，武士道的才子們底悲哀的情緒給觸發了，他們憤怒，怨恨，苦惱，愁煩：「春閨夢裏人」啊，接着嘆口一縷幽幽的長氣。除去野蠻的獸性發洩以外，祇是滿腔的空虛∶「等是有家歸未得呀，呀，呀！</p>
<p>於是春天之笑話來了；貓在屋簷上呌春，屋簷下武士道的才子們聽得了立刻歇斯的里地瘋在起來：終於下了總攻擊，一小隊總包抄過去：砰，砰，砰！呌春戞然而止，貓跌倒下去。但更寂寞，才子們更凄凉萬分：「苦悶的象微！」皺着眉頭咬起牙，他們和貓同感，在春天。</p>
<p>然而，他們底國內是沒有春天的：「該國當局昨日招待電影界專家，解釋政府新通過之法律，禁止全國靑年參觀愛情影片；同時檢查機關認為有不良影響之描寫倖運游戲之影片，亦在禁止之列，（據四月六日海通電。）」天哪，他們把貓的心這樣地先絞死了。自己早衰老了下去：不承認這是春天——但即使要一返老還童」罷，也是「回天乏術」了的：預防這個春天，先就實行了閹割的工作。（對於軍需資本家底瘋在的享受呢，照例是熟視無覩，這是二萬萬新　稅在作祟。）</p>
<p>地們給你一個不承認，呌，年靑的才子們　飲恨吞聲」（武士道的「呼天搶地」精神早絕去了傳統。），可是這個反映却是愈顯見其基礎之不穩的。</p>
<p>慷昔愛親覺羅氏皇朝之末年，雖然也到了迴光返照的時期，而對於「奉天承運」的技巧做得倒還蠻漂亮的，兪樾應淡烟疏雨落花天」之試，曾有「花落春仍在」之句，極獲官家深賞。（見春在堂筆記。）那是迎合了統治者底「掩飾」天下必然沒落的事物的心理。「春天常常留在這兒的，噯！」噯，現在呢，不曾聽見他們重新噯下去。僅僅「掩飾二番，聊慰寂寞，愛氏統治層本身的「空虛」，早可了然。然而該皇朝之不諱言「落花天」的沒落現象，無疑地還有着莫大的勇氣。他們是承認春天的。</p>

<p>某戰士在苦難中塡卜算子一詞，雖也有些才子意味，却頗見其戰鬥的風度。其後半闋是：「花落知春殘，一任風和雨；信是明年春再來，應有香如故。」</p>

<p>蔣委員長的衣服，每套沒有超過百元代價的</p>
<p>顧維鈞夫人對於衣服的收藏最合科學方法</p>
<p>我們最高領袖對於部屬常時誥誡着說：衣着不在乎華麗，却必須絕對保持端整淸潔。至於我們這位蔣委員長，他自己穿着到底怎樣，一般人大概很希望知道吧？要說他的衣服，確不愧國人模範，他並不像某將軍樣姑意做作，却是很恰當地表現出一個領袖的風度，普通家常便服，從不超過每套一百元的代價，以質樸耐穿而係國產是尙，色澤喜歡鼻煌色，僅只那件特級上將的制服，乃是化費了較高代價製就，不過穿着的次數很少，而且收藏得很好，他的衣服是長期交由花牌樓一家裁縫包做，前次政治中心遷移到漢口時，那裁縫也搬到江漢路，所以委員長的衣服始終山他們承做，那件上將制服，從前原交『凡爾登』乾洗整理的，現在環境阻碍，恐怕他老人家對這套衣服的整理倒要受一點麻煩，因為重慶等所在是沒有這種高尙的設備哩。顧維鈞夫人黃蕙蘭女士，久居歐美，深染洋化，對於衣服自也特別考究，尤其是收藏，全合科學手續，他每季衣服更換，必須逐一經過乾洗。據她介紹給張學良夫人于鳳至女士說：憑她嘗試，全滬（也可說全中國）的洗染店舖，祇有霞飛路華龍路西凡爾登乾洗店最合她的心意，後來于女士週游各國，返抵上海時，也告訴閨友，稱許黃女士的經騐充足，選剔精嚴，實在凡爾登的工作，可以媲美英法美各國。（按凡爾登電話係八三三八八號）</p>

<h3 id="c138">救濟知識靑年 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 玉全</p>
<p>在本月二日，報載有一位小學敎員，因被生活所逼，精神失常，不得已兩次作賊。十一日報又載，曾在南京某大學畢業之女學生及具有大中學程度之靑年二百餘人，均因生活艱難，以致淪為乞丐。我們讀了這兩段新聞，眞是非常痛心，他們都是具有高深學問的知識靑年，因孤島之生活不易，竟不能立足於社會，這實有喚起社會注意的必要，更需趕緊救濟他們。</p>
<p>現在，國際救濟會正詳細調査他們淪為乞丐的原因，俾由該會施以感化敎育，這辦法自然很對，不過我以為應該使他們到內地去，或是在孤島上幹些切實的工作，這樣，他們的生活旣可獲得解決，並且多少也可替國家做一點抗戰工作，不然，雖說是救濟了他們，但依然是埋沒了他們高深的學識。</p>
<p>很顯明，他們為什麼淪為乞丐，這究竟是誰賜予的？他們自己也很明白，這完全是受了侵略者的壓迫，我可斷定，他們每個人都有一顆熱烈的憤怒的心，他們未嘗不想報復，但結果總是因了人力的單薄，孤掌難鳴，找不到相當機會，以致淪落至此，他們決不會願意長久的靠別入來救濟，他們必須要謀求自己最大的出路。</p>
<p>現在，國際救濟會正在為這些失業者的生活問題而努力，我們希望該會替他們組織救國團體，使他們各階層分頭的努力，或是敎授他們生產技能，或是帮助他們得以到內地去，這樣一定能得到圓滿的成效，更是根本救濟的唯一的方法。</p>
<p>同時，我們希望這許多失業的知識靑年，能在這樣困難的環境下，埋頭苦幹，不要埋沒自己的學識能力，切實的來幹起救國工作！</p>
<h3 id="c139">論「同鄕會」 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 凡几</p>
<p>我們假使能够詳細地對上海的各種團體組織分析一下的話，則我們準可以發見，它們的性質與主旨，都是各各不同而有差異的；譬如，有的，是一種含有宗敎方面色彩的團體，如靑年會，女靑年會之類就是；有的，則就是屬於提倡正當的娛樂性質的，如華聯同樂會，益友社等等是，更有的，如精武體育會等，則專以鍜鍊體魄為主旨。此外，在銀行，洋行，以及各商家方面，利用業餘的閑空，集合了數十個志同道合的同志，以硏究學術，消遣娛樂為宗旨的團體，更是多得不可數計。的確，住在上海的每一個市民，都可以說是有機會加入或種團體，或者俱樂部，以獲得快活的團體生活的。</p>
<p>提到上海的團體組織，我們大概都很容易聯想到一種所謂「同鄕會」的團體上去吧。「同鄕會」所以設立的宗旨，與其他的團體組織同樣，也是以增進人們的福利，與改善人們的生活為主。不過，在一般的範圍上看來，因為它們只限於「同鄉」的緣故，它們的領域，要比他種團體組織小得多。</p>
<p>在最初的時候，上海原還是一片荒漢凄凉的白地，常然，是無所謂有什麽「同鄉會」的。直至後來日子漸漸久了，上海被闢成了通商的一個口岸，於是，交易興旰了，生意繫盛了，上海慢慢地才算踏上了繁榮的大道。同時，由外埠各地到上海來謀生的工商人士，也從少而漸漸地增多了；說起來，在目前上海的的四五百萬人口中，眞正的可以稱得」上海人」的，着實很少很少，大部份可謂都是當時從外埠遷來滬地經商，做工，因而長久居住起來的。這一羣從各地來上海的人士，為了各各的方言的不同，習俗的差別，當然，在每遇到了「同鄉」的時候，總會格外地顯得親熱些，要好些，所以，久而久之，為謀每個「同鄕」的福利與方便起見，他們便集合了起來，組織成了各個「同鄕會」，以便用集體的力量，來對各個身處異鄉的人士，做一些有益的事惰，履行一些互助救濟的責任。</p>
<p>以上，就可以說是「同鄕會」在上海創始的一個大概的經過情形，在目前，它們的勢力，的確已擴展到了一個很大很廣的區域了，它們的一舉一動，非但對「同鄕」，並且也足够使一他鄕」人士受到影響。其中，尤以寗波同鄉會，浦東同鄕會等幾個，最為問名，現今差不多每一個住在上海的人，都知道它們所做的事業的。</p>
<p>我已經早早說過，組織「同鄕會」的宗旨，就在於推行各項有利於「同鄉」的福利事業，所以凡像施醫給藥，設立會館，設立學校，以及其他一切的慈善事業，各個同鄕會差不多都在竭力地舉辦着。當前年「八一三」的戰事的序幕揭開了之後，「同鄕會所做的工作，就更緊張了：它們想盡了各種方法，開卡車去槍林彈雨的戰區中搶救「同鄕」出險，並且，更將位在租界上的會址，改變成了「難民所」，以作暫時收容一般「同鄉」的用……這一種偉大的服務精神，任何人見了，恐怕都會覺得欣慰與欽佩的吧。</p>
<p>我們大家都知道：「同鄕」結合的力量，在人與人的關係之間，可謂是最容易，最堅固的了。所以，孫總理也說過我們應該好好地儘量地利用「同鄉會」的組織，以加强團體的力量，以擴大集結的範圍（大意如此），那末，現在的中國，正在一個艱苦困難的境况中生長起來，這一種「同鄕會」的力量的更應寳貴，更應利用，是毫無疑義的了。的確，我們何必限制於「同鄉」這一個名義呢？我們必須將這一種機構，加强地擴大開來，從同鄕，而同省，而同國，而使每一個中國入民，都在抗戰的程序中，變成一個堅固的連環，萬衆一心，協力一致，大家都抱定了生同生，死同死的決心，那末，最後勝利的到來，我可以祖保，一定是最短期間的事實了。</p>
<h3 id="c140">王先生吃飯難 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 思敬</p>
<p>自從葉淺予的王先生風行以後，好像是天一公司首先把這漫畫上的人物王先生搬上銀幕，之後，飾演王先生的湯傑好像也自己攝製過幾部王先生的電影，但是過去都因為太偏重於「滑稽」，王先生電影對於觀衆的印象似乎反不及漫畫的深刻，這是一個非常明顯的例子，粗製濫造是必然地失敗的，雖然也能蒙蔽觀衆於一時。抗戰以還，王先生湯傑也跟救亡演劇隊出發到內地去了，及至他重歸上海，在一年多艱苦的旅程中，他一定是看到了更多的，更寳貴的事事物物，這戰後的第一部王先生電影「王先生吃飯難」，我們不能否認它是比以前的作品，有着若干的進步。</p>
<p>首先，他注意到了一社會不景氣，到處均歡吃飯難」底最現實的題材。並且，從王先生吃飯難的主題上，反映了艱險奸詐，世態炎凉的各面。如王先生做小買賣的時候，因為一個地痞的索取「孝敬」，使他終於換行業。當王先生上任的時候，因「王盛」這名字和他的「行頭」不在傳達的眼裏，地享了閉門羹，但是當王先生說明是秘書的時候，那位傳達就敬烟奉茶，先倨後恭起來。又如後來傳達的惟恐侍奉不週，旅館主人的長跪求罪，「王先生吃飯難一是盡了諷刺的能事的。這裏有最可愛的一塲戲，就是王先生追取鈔票，它是象徵了人類追逐在鈔票後面的醜態</p>
<p>「王先生吃飯難」同時也提到了家庭問題和婦女問題，如因為王先生的失業，妻子偕了女兒出走。最後王先生續娶，他女兒知道她的丈夫是爸爸的時候，她說：「爸爸害了我了！」但是「王先生吃飯難」也自有它的缺點，如上面二個問題，它祗是當作戲劇性的穿揷。王先生在投河遇救後，他說「死是懦弱的，我要奮鬥！」在電影上並沒有吿訴我們怎樣去奮鬥，王先生却偶然的去做秘書了，這不免使人抱僥倖之心的。</p>
<p>關於過去的王先生電影，我是看得很少的，湯傑的王先生是否比以前進步，我不知道，但覺得他的動作是頗有若干漫畫作風的。至於滑稽，如王師母出走後，王先生在公園中到處碰見儷影雙變的情侶，及吃大餅時候喂魚等等都很可愛的。王先生擺拆字攤那塲戲：唱露天舞台的小丑搶去了他的主顧，憤而打毀字攤，當王先生跌倒在地上的時候，剛接上一段「投軍別窰」，王先生把破散的桌面套上他頭去，小丑父接唱「起解」，這是頗見導演者的聰明的。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第八回　是幻是眞逢塲作戲　宜行宜止到處為家</p>
<p>且說朱愛人本的定何家兩位小姐，下星期到自由村去。在星期五的下午，忽接到吳君素的電話，約她們星期六晚上，到她的學校中去看戲。原來這東吳大學校的文學院，中有一科戲劇科。這戲劇科，雖非是文學院的必修科目，然而大學生的研習此科的人很多。這些男女學生們，又自己組織了一個戲劇同志研究會，平素討綸硏習，每年父有爾次公演。此外逢着什麼公私紀念日，他們也有演劇之舉。這本來不是職業的演劇，只是愛好戲劇者，藉此為娛樂之資罷了。學校裏太來有個小型劇塲，雖說是個小型劇塲，也有一千餘人的坐位。這劇塲也不單是專供演劇用的，有時學校裏開什麽講演會，也是在這個劇塲裏。還有在蘇州別個文化機關，開什麽鉅大的盛會，或是歡迎國外的名流，請他演講的時候，也都是借着這個劇塲。因為有許多文化機關集合在一起，東吳大學也總是其中的一份子咧。而這個劇塲用得最多的時候，却是開放電影劇。難道東吳大學裏面，開了個電影院，作為學校的副業嗎？這決不是的。蘇州的電影院，也開得很不少，東吳大學，也決不會搶地們的生意。東吳大學的劇塲，所開放的電影，有很多是關於學術上的。大家知道近來電影的發展，是世界進化上的一個大大的帮助。對於社會敎育，文化宣傳的力量最大，不是專供娛樂之用。而電影的進步，自從電視發明以來，眞是學術界無上的權威。電影的進步到如何程度，我目不必去說它。單說科學界發明一件事物，都可以用電影來說明，而且往往有文字所說不明白的，把電影一開放，原原本本的，使外行人也可以了然於胸。自然這種電影，有通俗的，有深奧的，種類也不少。總而言之，却是開人智慧，助人知識，有益於人羣。近來因為各國的電影進步，而交通又極便利，國際間的電影，互相交換開映。現在世界電影最發達的，第一位還是美國，而第二位却要算蘇聯了。蘇聯關於學術上的電影最多，冰山雪島，潛艇飛機，映出的很多，而美國最近也一變作風。（八五）</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>四進士劇中的人名多是有所取意的</p>
<p>皮黃戲裏的羣戲最好看，像「戰宛城」「法門寺」「摘纓會」等固然都是生·旦·淨·丑·合演的大　戲，但是比較起來還不如「四進士」來得熱鬧。它這齣戲裏有青衣（楊素貞）有花旦（萬氏）有作工老生（宋士傑）有硬裏子老生（毛朋）有小生（田倫）有武生（保童天才）此外還有個主要的腳色田氏，有用貼旦扮演的其實這個角可以由俊扮的彩旦飾演，那就更齊整啦。以上所舉的十幾個人，在這齣戲裏，全都佔有重要的地位，與普通劇中除了三幾位主角以外，別的配角衹不過隨出隨進者不同。一般人看來，都是以宋士傑為是劇之主，像從前的孫菊仙潘月棋和現在的周信芳馬連良都是這樣唱下來的。不過他們夾帶的配角中要沒有出色的花旦花面（比較上還是萬氏顧覩更為重要）來輔弼著他們，恐怕在許多的「蓋口」裏是很難見到精彩的。因為蓋口是兩人問答或頂嘴啃詞時，最需要緊嚴湊密的。上海人說話「硬碰硬」，就是這個意思。兩人中倘有一個分量軟了些，或接話時遲疑一些，於是這齣戲就失了精彩了。</p>
<p>當日編這齣戲的人，的確是個深通法律而且老於仕途的人，他把專制時代官官相護，徇私舞弊，以及貧戝人家有冤難伸的種種黑幕，全部揭出。並且捧出兩痊見義勇為，不畏權勢的宋士傑與楊春來，代滿腹含冤的楊索貞報了殺夫之仇，一狀告掉了兩員封疆大史，和一名七品知縣。宋楊雖都是平民，敢說是毫無勢力之可言，然而一個能精通律法，一個能不屈不撓，衹要抓住田顧二人行賄與受賄的鐵證，發現他們食污的弱點，那就不怕他們的官不掉，腦袋不搬場。別瞧宋等是小民，只要他們的理正，就敢同一品三品的大員碰上一碰。在封建時代能有這樣的一齣戲編出來，的確可以替換蹄之下的小百姓吐一口氣，也讓一般貪官污吏有所警惕。</p>

<h3 id="e10">On the General Counteroffensive <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>For more than ten days, the news of the Chinese army's general counteroffensive has been widely spread. According to dispatches from various sources: In Suiyuan, the Chinese army attacked Bailingmiao; in Shanxi, it captured Xiaxian and pressed Wenxi; in Shandong, it fought in Taierzhuang; in Henan, it captured Kaifeng and besieged Xinyang; in Jiangsu, it attacked Yixing; in Anhui, it captured Suxian; in Hubei, it crossed the Xiang River and besieged Zhongxiang, Yangzi, and Pingjing Pass; in Jiangxi, it fought over Gao'an and pressed Wuchang and Wuning; in Guangdong, it captured Huaxian and besieged Zengcheng. These are all the results of the battles in the past week. Such a phenomenon was not seen in the initial battles. It is not only the Chinese who are happy to tell each other that the general counteroffensive is indeed extraordinary, but also many newspapers of friendly countries believe that the entire situation will be completely changed in a few weeks. Having endured the war for twenty-one months, the stability of the people's hearts and the vigor of morale have shown the absolute possibility of a protracted war, and they deeply believe that the final victory is as certain as holding a contract, which is difficult and valuable for any country that has suffered a great disaster. However, it is also natural to hope for an early victory. Therefore, after the widespread news of the general counteroffensive, followed by the successive good news from various places, there is even more vitality. However, the passion of patriotism is not aroused by stimulation; what maintains passion is a calm reason. As far as we know and feel, China's general counteroffensive should still be awaited and has not yet begun.</p>
<p>There are two ways for China to win: Japan's internal collapse, one of them. There are three ways for internal collapse: one is the decline of the military and civilian mentality, from war-weariness to the surface and active actions of anti-war; the second is the exhaustion of public and private economies, internal bankruptcy of all industries, exhaustion of tax sources, social upheaval, and government disintegration, external failure to continue military payment; the third is military failure, military strategic failure, depletion of military equipment, and decline of military discipline. If one of the three exists, it will not be able to continue its aggression, and defeat and death will follow; then China will win. China's strength, the second. In other words, without waiting for Japan's internal collapse, the Chinese side will strengthen its strength through military training, military equipment, and enhanced strength. Crushing strong enemies; then, with a sound of general counteroffensive, sweeping away foreign invaders and restoring rivers and mountains. Therefore, China's victory depends on three factors of the opponent's internal collapse and one factor of its own strengthening; that is, expecting victory from the general counteroffensive is only one end of the expectation, not the only expectation.</p>
<p>Saying that the internal collapse is on their side and strengthening ourselves is the only thing we should seek. This is the most self-denying statement. Looking back on the initial war of resistance up to now, what the Chinese authorities have been most committed to is indeed this. As far as we have heard, regarding the army, the replenishment of the front line is certainly supplemented as much as necessary; and the training of new troops is trained as much as possible; therefore, the actual strength exerted on the front line is not the highest degree of strength, and what is stored in the rear is an inexhaustible main force. Regarding military equipment: After years of internal strife in China, the armies were all formed by indiscriminate recruitment and crude compilation. Having guns and bullets meant being a soldier, and gathering soldiers meant forming a team or an army. Therefore, apart from guns and bullets, there was almost no military equipment; only a few units had relatively complete equipment and training standards. Before the start of the War of Resistance, there was not much time to plan for the replenishment of military equipment; and now, two years later, new military equipment and heavy military equipment have been continuously imported, accumulating into a magnificent force, and the proficiency in its use cannot be achieved overnight, but it can indeed progress with each passing day, and it can be greatly completed after a few months. When the army training is completed and the military equipment is greatly completed, then it can be counterattacked and victory can be guaranteed. This is what is called seeking ourselves. The period is not far away. But not now.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the so-called internal collapse on their side, in fact, the matter of promoting its collapse is still here, not there. After China's twenty-one months of war, although it has not yet collapsed, whether psychologically, economically, or militarily, it has long been marching towards the path of collapse. Without going into detail about the distant past, even after the Chinese army withdrew from Wuhan, Japan, after four months of rest and adjustment, obtained Nanchang at a great sacrifice; what they sacrificed was like paying to the east, and what they progressed was of no great significance. Moreover, when the proportion of space and time is taken into account, its momentum is like the end of a strong crossbow, far from the initial invasion. There is still a distance between its decline and its internal collapse; and the recent actions taken by the Chinese army in various places are aimed at shortening this distance. Under this action, the battle results are as described above, which is indeed gratifying; however, the value does not lie in recovery and progress, but in making them unable to defend safely and unable to stand still; making them exhausted and tired endlessly. In this way, their internal collapse will be faster, and the opportunity for China to obtain a total victory will be closer. Recovery and progress, as well as the general counteroffensive, are all stimulating words; but at this moment, rather than saying that stimulation is needed, it is better to say that the greatest determination to endure pain and sacrifice is needed, and the greatest contribution to spending money and effort is needed!</p>

<h3 id="e12">Military Commission Announces Weekly War Situation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Commission discussed the war situation for the week (6th to 12th), saying that this week our army took advantage of the remaining power of annihilating the enemy from last week and implemented strong pressure on the enemy. The fighting was extremely fierce. The enemy, after suffering heavy losses, was weakened and exhausted, repeatedly defeated, and famous cities and important towns were successively recovered. As of the time of the report, this trend of victory is continuing to unfold on both the northern and southern battlefields. The progress of the operations is generally described as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Front: Over a thousand enemies in Zengcheng, relying on intense artillery fire for days, launched a very urgent two-pronged attack eastward towards Pingfeng Ridge and Hulu Peak. After a valiant counterattack, they have been broken up one by one, with more than half of the enemy killed. The county town is now tightly surrounded, and the enemy's several attempts to break through have been unsuccessful. In the Conghua area, over two thousand enemies launched an attack towards Dawo Lang and Bietou Market on the morning of the 6th. After flanking attacks from both sides, the enemy's communications were completely cut off. By the evening of the 8th, they had completely collapsed across the entire line, with over 600 casualties. In the battle of Bietou Market, the enemy's Regiment Commander Lin was shot and killed. The enemy is extremely panicked. Along the Yuehan Railway line, Xin Street, Dalan, and Guanyao were captured on the 6th. Although the enemy has joined forces to counterattack in recent days, there have been no results. On both sides of the Xijiang River, the area around Xinhui and Jiangmen is still in a state of mixed warfare. The strongholds of Makou, Xinxu, and Dagang have all been decisively captured, with over 300 enemy corpses abandoned. The remaining enemies are currently being mopped up. Over a thousand enemies on Hainan Island, with over twenty tanks, launched attacks towards Anliang Huangzhuang and other places belonging to Ding'an on the 7th and 8th. Our officers and soldiers waited at ease and launched a head-on attack, killing over 400 enemies and destroying six tanks. At the same time, another unit of our army took advantage of the situation to recapture Ding'an City. The enemy's fierce offensive has been greatly thwarted by this major blow.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Front: Over two thousand enemies facing Tang from Nanchang, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on us from the evening of the 6th. Our army valiantly counterattacked, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat, and fighting fiercely for a whole day and night. The position remained unshaken. By dawn on the 8th, a sudden counterattack was launched, and the enemy fled in panic, escaping north towards Nanchang. The area was recovered, and Gao'an County was also captured at the same time. The enemy retreated towards Fengxin. After a victorious pursuit, Dacheng was recaptured. One side used powerful troops to press towards Fengxin, and the enemy's entire line wavered, scrambling to escape. By noon on the 10th, the enemy launched a large-scale reinforcement counterattack, and the battle situation was fierce. Due to the disparity in numbers, our army in Gao'an still shifted to its original position to encircle and attack the enemy. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle, and the corpses were piled up like mountains. Over seven thousand enemies in Wuning, with over thirty artillery pieces and over thirty aircraft, continuously counterattacked our attacking troops for days. An extremely fierce struggle took place in the Yan Gang Street area west of the city. Our officers and soldiers, with one against a hundred, relied on an overwhelming and unmatched attacking spirit to inflict repeated heavy blows on the invading enemy. They are currently advancing smoothly.</p>
<p>Hubei-Hunan Front: In Hubei Province, our attacking troops have achieved three major victories this week. Our army in eastern Hubei advanced westward, and after fierce battles for three days from the 6th to the 8th, successively captured Luwang City, Hua'er Bridge, Hekou Town, and Wangjia Shop. They are currently continuing to press southward, encircling and annihilating the remaining enemies in Huang'an City. The vanguard of the attacking Ying Shan and Anlu in northern Hubei, after recovering Haojia'an and Leigong Shop, the enemy trapped in the county town has become a turtle in a jar. They are now continuing to retreat towards Huayuan and Xiaogan. Our army in central Hubei, besieging Zhongxiang, adopted a four-pronged attack formation, capturing Xiaojia Shop east of the city on the 7th, Xinjie west of the city on the 8th, Yangzi Town north of the city on the 9th, and Yuxin River south of the city on the 11th. The enemy stubbornly resisted in the isolated city, and our army braved enemy artillery fire and poison gas, bravely charging and killing, once attacking into the north city on the 9th, killing countless enemies. With the successive capture of key locations in eastern Hubei, northern Hubei, and central Hubei, the enemy in Wuhan is extremely terrified and is currently strengthening fortifications, attempting to put up a desperate fight. In the Yueyang area of northern Hunan, there have been no unusual changes in the war situation. The enemy on Junshan, north of Dongting Lake, was attacked by our troops on the 7th. The enemy stubbornly resisted, relying on the terrain, but was finally captured by the morning of the 8th. The remaining enemies fled back to their boats and escaped.</p>
<p>Shanxi Front: In An'yi, Yuncheng, Yuxiang, and other places in southern Shanxi, the Japanese army, which had attacked Zhongtiao Mountain, was defeated by us last week. On the 8th, over a thousand remnant enemies in Zhangdian Town showed signs of moving again. Our army in the east of the town rushed to attack them fiercely, and the enemy abandoned over 200 corpses and retreated. Over four thousand enemies in Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingshi in eastern Shanxi, with many cannons and tanks, attacked Wanghe and Wangtao Town (both in Pingyao) eastward for days. Our army bravely launched an attack, engaging in fierce battles for several days, annihilating a large number of enemies. On the 8th, a part of the enemy army once sneaked into Wanghe, but after a fierce counterattack, the enemy's offensive was greatly thwarted. They are currently facing each other at Wangtao Town, Shimen Street, and Wangfeng Village. Over three thousand enemies in Huo County failed to attack Yangjiazhuang last week. This week, they continued to attack eastward, engaging in a week of bloody battles. The enemy has been completely defeated, with extremely heavy casualties, and their offensive has been thwarted. A part of the enemy between Ningwu and Shenchi in northern Shanxi was ambushed by our army on the morning of the 9th, and the enemy was surrounded. The enemy stubbornly resisted to the death, and after three hours of fierce fighting, most of them were annihilated by us. Over a hundred remnant enemies retreated towards Ningwu. Taking advantage of the victory to pursue, they have already pressed under the city of Ningwu.</p>
<p>In addition, over three thousand enemies in Xinyang, Henan, on the 8th, divided into three routes, one crossing the river from Xishuang River, one towards Yangliu River, and one approaching the vicinity of the Xi River, attacking and breaking through westward, and engaging in fierce battles with our army attacking Xinyang. The fighting on the Yangliu River was particularly fierce. Our army divided and fought bravely, breaking through the enemy's line, and the encirclement circle became increasingly smaller. The remaining enemies in the corner will not be difficult to capture. Near Kaifeng, our army suddenly launched a large-scale attack on the city walls around 1:00 PM on the 11th, completely occupying all the key points and stations in the suburbs of the city. The enemy stubbornly resisted in the city, and our army charged into the city, killing countless enemies. The remaining enemies abandoned their weapons and fled, and the county town was once recaptured by our army. The mixed fighting is still extremely fierce. The enemy in Jintan and Lishui in Jiangnan suddenly increased to over five thousand, with over seventy tanks. On the 7th and 8th, they launched fierce attacks from Tianwang Temple and Lishui in two routes. Our army intercepted them north of Xinqiao in southern Lishui, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented in that area. Another part of our army circled behind the enemy, cutting off their retreat. The enemy abandoned corpses all over the field. Another part of our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Yixing on the 10th. The enemy was caught off guard and fled in droves. We immediately recaptured Yixing. (12th Dispatch)</p>

Afterwards, he accompanied the American advisor to the Chinese Air Force to the Kunming airfield, where he saw only a few aircraft damaged and awaiting repair. The losses were minimal. The Japanese claim that 41 Chinese aircraft were destroyed is completely untrue, as all the intact Chinese aircraft had already taken off at that time. (12th Associated Press)</p>

<p>Remarks by an Australian Parliamentarian</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Australian parliamentarian Dunnageran, who recently inspected Japan, North China, and Northeast China, returned to Australia via Hong Kong yesterday. According to his observations, he believes that if Britain and the United States want to maintain their interests in the Far East, they must cooperate practically and take a firm stance against Japan as soon as possible. Japan's economic panic is serious, and the people's war-weariness is increasing. He saw Japanese troops departing in Moji, but there were no well-wishers, which was completely different from before. In his opinion, Japan's economy cannot support the war against China. Democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France should exert economic pressure on Japan to curb its aggression. He also said that the US policy of isolationism is short-sighted.

<p>Decide to Offer Full Assistance Should They Face Threats</p>
<p>Consider the Mediterranean Vital and Unwilling to Allow Changes to the Status Quo</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain entered the House of Commons at 5:55 PM and delivered his long-awaited speech on the international situation. The entire House stood and cheered to welcome him. The Prime Minister declared that the events that caused the House to convene early have caused widespread anxiety and disturbance, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then detailed the events in Albania, saying that the accounts of these events are contradictory, sometimes entirely from one side. The background of these events is also interpreted differently. The Prime Minister then read conflicting detailed reports from both the Italian and Albanian sides, saying that a major power has brandished its power to impose its will on a small and relatively defenseless nation. The government has not yet received information from the British Minister to Albania regarding the events of "Good Friday." The day after the events, the Albanian government appealed to Britain to exert its utmost to "help a small country fight to the death to defend its territory." Regarding the general impact of the Italian military actions, there is no doubt that the world is deeply shocked by this new phenomenon of the wanton use of force, whether directly or indirectly, and the Italian claim that Italian expatriates were suppressed by Albania is widely doubted. The government has lodged a strong protest with the Italian government and has attempted to ascertain Italy's intentions. The Italian government's recent response stated that the future will be determined by the will of the Albanian people.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued that the Anglo-Italian Agreement has been ratified and should not be invalidated at this time. He firmly believes that the signing of the Anglo-Italian Agreement was justified, and there is nothing now to change this confidence. The Prime Minister said, "I now express my sincere and deep disappointment at Italy's actions. These actions cast a shadow over the sincerity of Italy's guarantees. The British government feels that it is now imperative to leave no doubt in people's minds about the position of the British government. This is our inescapable and non-negotiable responsibility."</p>
<p>"Therefore, I take this opportunity, on behalf of the British government, to emphasize the great importance we attach to avoiding the disturbance of the status quo in the Mediterranean and the Balkan Peninsula by force or the threat of force. Therefore, the British government has decided that in the event of any clear threat to the independence of Greece or Romania, and the governments of Greece and Romania consider it necessary to resist with their national forces, the British government will feel obligated to immediately assist Greece or Romania with all its strength. France has expressed its agreement to this." (Cheers from the audience.) At the time, some members of the opposition party shouted "Soviet Union." The Prime Minister immediately replied, saying that if I have not mentioned the Soviet Union, it does not mean that we are not currently maintaining extremely close contact with representatives of the Soviet Union. We have a very difficult task before us, that is, we must not only consider what we want ourselves, but also what the people of other countries want. We have no prejudice, no preconceived notions, or ideological opinions. We are now trying our best to command and lead all the forces that uphold peace and are willing to resist aggression, so that our efforts may achieve practical results.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's speech lasted for thirty-four minutes, and he took his seat at 3:29. The atmosphere in the entire House was extremely tense during the Prime Minister's speech, and cheers were heard from all sides. When the Prime Minister went to the House of Commons from 10 Downing Street, crowds lined the streets and cheered.</p>
<p>During his speech, the Prime Minister revealed that Foreign Secretary Halifax had told the Italian Chargé d'Affaires in London that Britain had no intention of occupying the islands of Greece, but that the British government would take a very serious view if other countries occupied the islands. The Foreign Secretary made these remarks based on a telegram from the British Minister to Greece reporting that the Italian army was inclined to occupy the islands. The Foreign Secretary also told the Italian Chargé d'Affaires that the British government would not misunderstand this point and that it was absolutely crucial. (13th Reuters Urgent Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier delivered a radio address to the nation this afternoon, stating that the French government has taken military measures to defend the metropolitan border and colonial empire to cope with all events. He was pleased to note that reservists of all ranks were enthusiastically enlisting. Regarding France's position on the current international situation, I explained it on the 29th of last month. In short, at a time when the European situation is precarious and unstable, France is determined to maintain peace within the framework of freedom and honor. The first step is to strengthen national defense and to strengthen alliances with those nations that are "determined to resist aggression and maintain freedom," especially with the governments of Britain, the United States, Soviet Russia, Poland, and the Balkan Entente countries, namely Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Our goal is to convene and cooperate with those nations that have no intention of threatening the vital interests of other countries, are determined to resist all hegemonic attempts, and are willing to openly discuss current issues. We are convinced that this goal can be achieved.</p>

<p>(New York) According to a statement issued today by the Soviet Reserve Bank, gold imported into the United States in March totaled $365 million, the largest figure since the Czech crisis last fall. The total amount imported included the following countries: Britain $250 million, Netherlands $27 million, Belgium $37 million, Switzerland $8 million, and Japan $11 million. Regarding gold imports, it is reported that the US Postal Authorities have issued an order banning the import of gold worth more than $5,000 into the United States by mail or parcel. This order will be implemented immediately, but it does not apply to items already in transit. (12th Reuters)</p>
<p>As for the mutual understanding between Britain and France, its closeness and strength have never been greater. I am now speaking to the nation with the prior consent of both my own government and the British government." Thereupon, Prime Minister Daladier stated that the French government had offered guarantees to Greece and Romania, declaring that if the independence and sovereignty of those countries were threatened, it would assist them with all its strength. (All that was said was the same as that spoken by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the British House of Commons this afternoon.) In addition, the British and Polish governments have mutually accepted obligations, declaring that they will assist each other to defend their independence and sovereignty in the event of direct or indirect threats. The French government is very pleased to learn of this. The current alliance treaties between France and Poland have also been reaffirmed in the same spirit. As soon as the vital interests of both countries are directly or indirectly threatened, they will immediately rise up to help each other. This measure should be communicated to the governments of all concerned countries, especially the government of Turkey. In short, the maintenance of territorial integrity and the security of the colonial empire to cope with all kinds of direct and indirect threats is the right of France. The government is fully aware of the great responsibility in implementing this policy and will fulfill its duties with a firm will and a dedicated determination to complete the destiny of the nation.

Furthermore, the announcement stated that Mussolini has discussed the withdrawal of Italian troops stationed in Spain with senior Italian military officers. There are also reports that Italy promised the withdrawal of Italian troops from Spain long ago, but has not yet fulfilled it. Mussolini's subtle stance seems to be in anticipation of the policy declaration to be issued by Britain and France, hoping that the attitude will not be too severe, leaving some room for maneuvering.

<p>Lloyd George first stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham on the 17th of last month, after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, declaring the abandonment of the policy of appeasement and safeguarding freedom and international law in a more resolute manner. It is still difficult to determine whether these words were sincere or just to appease the people. If the Prime Minister's words are not sincere or if he changes his original intention afterwards, the repercussions will be that the likes of Hitler and Mussolini will inevitably resort to violence again. In short, what the Prime Minister's true intention is will be known tomorrow. In my opinion, the Prime Minister's attitude towards the establishment of a practical military understanding between Britain and the Soviet Union can be regarded as a touchstone for whether the Prime Minister is truly aware. The government's current plan is to invite small countries such as Romania, Greece, and Yugoslavia to take risks and join the anti-aggression group. Does it know that this plan, without the support of the Soviet Union, will ultimately be futile? On the contrary, if Britain establishes a military understanding with the Soviet Union and unites the strength of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly resist any aggression by any dictatorial country, the great effect of this cannot be conveyed by words. "However, if Britain and France do not provide practical guarantees and declare that they will not engage in empty talk, the Soviet Union will not cooperate. If we again form an ambiguous alliance, as we have done for many years, the Soviet Union will definitely not participate. This is what I firmly believe. It should be known that after we conclude an anti-aggression alliance with the Soviet Union, we can use the world's most powerful army, the most elite air force, and the richest resources to fight on the front lines that we cannot easily reach. In this way, I dare to assert that no dictatorial country will dare to act rashly again." The government's previous actions were based on three erroneous concepts: (1) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini must remain loyal to the Rome-Berlin Axis; (2) General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, will eventually abandon the dictatorial countries; (3) We still have complete control over the Mediterranean. However, the truth is far from it. The two sides of the Strait of Gibraltar are equipped with heavy artillery from Germany and Italy, and aircraft fields have been built. With Italy occupying Albania and the Spanish Nationalist government joining the anti-Comintern pact, Britain's bases in the Mediterranean have been greatly threatened. "In short, we are surrounded in both the east and west of the Mediterranean. If we delay any longer, maritime traffic will be completely cut off, and our country will be controlled by the aggressor countries. The government has been deceived again and again. If it does not change its course, it will be fooled by clever people again. This must be taken seriously." (May 12th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) The "Washington Post" stated in an editorial today that compromise has failed, and resistance has taken its place. If the Soviet Union and the United States do not act actively and consistently, resistance may be too late. The exaggerations of the dictators will become reality, and the Axis will no longer fear being opposed by Britain and France alone. (May 12th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) Churchill, a leader of the far-right wing of the Conservative Party, delivered a speech in Edinburgh this evening, stating that the government should implement a new diplomatic policy with an indomitable spirit. "The new diplomatic policy that we are now implementing focuses on contacting all peace-loving countries and concluding alliances with them to form a peace group to resist aggression. This matter should be pursued with perseverance and determination to move forward in order to be successful. If we abandon it halfway, security cannot be expected, and the psychology of those countries that threaten world peace and hate our country will not be alleviated. To this day, the Anglo-Italian Agreement has been torn up. The only way to deal with it is to organize a collective security system and change the national voluntary service system into a mandatory one." (May 12th, Havas)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Sino-Japanese War was the focus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's discussion of the Neutrality Act yesterday. Representative Isaacs, a Democrat from California, suggested that "If the United States declares Japan an aggressor, then the United States can prohibit continued trade relations between the United States and Japan until Japan restores the Open Door Policy in China." Fengwick, an expert on the Neutrality Act, suggested that "I agree that the United States should not allow countries that tear up treaties, such as Japan, to pass through the Panama Canal. All bills that support cutting off trade relations with aggressor countries may defeat Japan. If this bill had been implemented earlier, the Sino-Japanese War might not have broken out." Representative Coody Ford, a Republican from Michigan, believes that all measures should not only be applied to Japan, but also to all other aggressor countries. (May 13th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) During the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment in the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, Fenwick, a professor of international law at Bowdoin College in the United States, asked the United States to prohibit the passage of merchant ships of countries that violate international treaties, whether in war or in peace, through the Panama Canal. This measure by the United States will be able to seriously strike "lawless countries" such as Japan, Italy, and Germany. Fenwick also said that if trade relations are cut off with countries that violate treaties, it will surely bring the current Sino-Japanese War to a halt and cause Japan to fail. He strongly supports the resolution proposed by "Thomas" in Congress authorizing the President to declare Japan an aggressor, and asked Congress to find a way to cut off trade relations with Japan as soon as possible. According to him, although the United States will suffer some losses if it cuts off trade relations with Japan, it is a necessary measure to safeguard the rights and principles of the United States. He also said that this action by the United States will not lead to war between the United States and Japan. On the contrary, if the United States remains silent and allows Japan to return fully loaded, the Philippines will soon be controlled by it, and other interests will also be hit. At that time, even if we do not want to fight, we will not be able to avoid it. (May 12th, Associated Press)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Readjustment of Soviet Policy (Continued) <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Te Ye</p>
<p>Reliance on Nationalism—No Emphasis on Agreements—</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Capacity for War</p>
<p>During the conflict with Japanese troops in August, each side deployed a division. The Far Eastern Red Army, following instructions from Moscow, engaged in combat on a strictly limited front, demonstrating to the world that the Soviet Union "would never retreat an inch of its own land." This demonstration, while seemingly grand, was purely for show from the perspective of rescuing Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union were to go to war with Germany, Poland, in any case, would stubbornly maintain neutrality, becoming a "Chinese Great Wall" between the two countries. As for Romania, even if the Romanian government were willing to allow Soviet troops passage, it would be of little use from a strategic and logistical standpoint. Therefore, in the initial stages, the Soviet military's activities would be limited to long-range bombing (since Czechoslovakia's position cannot provide the Red Air Force with a base) and submarine patrols in the Baltic Sea to attack enemy ships. However, if the Soviet Union wished, it could deploy a large army in later stages, because changes are unpredictable in a major war, and avenues of advance would open.</p>
<p>Mutual assistance agreements have always been nominal, merely rounds in diplomatic maneuvering. The general staffs of both sides have never held serious talks, so when the crisis arrived, neither the French chargé d'affaires in Moscow, nor the Czech minister, nor even the military attaché at the Czech legation, received a clear explanation of what actions the Red Army was prepared to take.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Attitude toward Britain. The Soviet government knows full well that France has no intention of going to war with Hitler for Czechoslovakia, and that Britain will also be the same, so it resolutely decided to initially distance itself from the legitimate efforts of Geneva, seeking, in this regard,  .  Litvinov twice declared in Geneva that the Soviet Union was determined to fulfill its obligations under the Soviet agreement with all available means. This, of course, required France to fulfill its responsibilities as an ally of Czechoslovakia, attacking Germany, before the Soviet Union could do so. In the Soviet view, Czechoslovakia has now become a target for Germany, able to supply Hitler with ten divisions when needed. The situation is hopeless, and all Soviet attitudes toward Western democracies have now become as cold as a frigid spring. The Bolsheviks gnash their teeth at Chamberlain, seeing him as an even greater villain than before, and the Soviet newspapers downplay Britain's efforts. They continue as usual, discussing European events as if the Soviet Union were on another planet. The Moscow authorities believe that Germany's next attack will be directed westward. Their main concern is the Japanese threat, and all military schools are currently undergoing a lesson in silence. "War in the spring."</p>
<p>Eastern European Countries Take the Opportunity to Observe</p>
<p>Some British newspapers have proposed the idea of a coming "friendship" between the Soviet Union and Germany, which has greatly harmed the nerves of Eastern Europe. This strategy only benefits Hitler. If Germany relaxes its armed aggression and prepares to supply the Soviet arms factories with semi-finished materials, and the Soviet Union prepares to supply Germany with important raw materials, then Soviet-German trade, which had fallen to one-seventh of its level before the Hitler era, can be greatly restored. But no matter how much the Soviet Union welcomes the easing of diplomatic tensions, friendship is another matter. Politicians in democratic countries cannot understand the conflict between Soviet and German ideologies. It must be understood that this is not just a matter of loyalty, but a fundamental organizational issue. The organizations of the two countries have always been diametrically opposed. The Soviet Union is well aware that Hitler has [lacuna], and Germany's economic difficulties will soon force Hitler to become active on one side or the other.</p>
<p>The resolution of the Soviet Agreement, France said, "is currently being disinfected," which is true, but this agreement cannot be considered a dead thing. It is currently being subtly hypnotized so that it continues to breathe faintly.</p>
<p>The relations between the Eastern European countries still seem to be as elusive as before. It is difficult to tell which way the "national cat" will jump, and thus be able to show what kind of "cat walk" diplomacy Germany is currently doing in Eastern Europe. No country is willing to make a definite statement. However, exchanges of friendly gestures are currently taking place and being touted between the capitals of Eastern Europe and Moscow. The Soviet Union and the countries on the Black Sea coast have even been exploring the possibility of concluding a "Black Sea Pact." To date, there has been little success. This pact is unlikely to be completed unless Bulgaria joins the Balkan Group.</p>
<p>Poland, angered by Hitler's strange theory of a "Carpathian Ruthenian" ethnicity (the area is actually mostly inhabited by the original "Great Russian" people), has promoted an important trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Poland. Polish newspapers, which previously often used malicious insults against the Soviet Union, have now turned to compliments, saying that "the Soviet Union's manpower and mineral resources are inexhaustible." The Soviet newspapers, however, remain silent. The Poles are rash and warlike, and now seem to be watching the situation on the plain between their hereditary enemy Germany and their former master, the Soviet Union, where there is no defensible area. If Poland cautiously leans towards the Soviet Union and maintains its neutrality, Germany's attempt to invade Soviet Ruthenia will be difficult to realize for a while. However, if Hitler listens to the astute German quartermaster, Germany may invade Soviet Ruthenia through the narrow neck of Romania.</p>
<p>The Red Army's Purges Have Yielded Tangible Results</p>
<p>Hitler's Ruthenian policy has not yet been implemented, "partly due to prudent planning that has already been achieved." He seems to hope that the non-Russian peoples within the Soviet Union will be induced by his "racialist" propaganda to secede from the Soviet Union and become independent. Hitler holds this illusion, but ignores more than a dozen contrary factors. He even turns a blind eye to a recent important event: during the large-scale purges in 1937-38, Stalin preemptively eliminated all the leaders of the non-Russian peoples in the Soviet republics. With this, Hitler, no matter how eloquent, will find it difficult to fulfill his wishes.</p>
<p>The Red Army's purge movement is now a thing of the past. Except for General Bely Rutze in the Far East, who remains in a high position due to his widespread popularity, the soldiers in other areas no longer fear purges. At least two million soldiers read the new oath. Not only must they read it, but they must also sign it, which proves that both those who issue the orders and those who sign the oath know the incredible importance of the signed oath. This can also be proven by the recent government order confirming the new positions of 56 generals who were promoted to the highest command last year. This is the first time the government has issued such an order since the execution of General Tukhachevsky in 1937.</p>
<p>The Soviet army is now in the process of overall strengthening, with several new divisions joining its ranks each month. Approaching the western border are about forty divisions equipped with armaments. The inconvenience of transportation between the border and the interior, and the inelasticity of war potential, will remain the main weaknesses of the Soviet Union. However, the authorities have already stockpiled enough supplies near the border to meet needs for many months, and within three months can easily mobilize 100 divisions of 10,000 regular troops per division concentrated on the western frontier. The Soviet Union is now reverting to the concept of "assembling large corps" for military strategy. The individual glory that may have been lost in the purge is now likely to be compensated by "the glory of the group." Outsiders often scorned what Conrad (a Polish nobleman who hated Russians all his life) called the Russian "cynicism" of relying solely on numbers (meaning those who are arrogant and think the world revolves around them). Russians themselves would often invite this scorn, especially before their great defeat in the war with Japan in 1903-04, when they boasted: "We will suffocate the enemy under Russian hats." However, the Russian nature of "assembling large corps" is indeed one of their strengths. Now that the Soviet army is equipped with modern weapons and has undergone a completely new social organization, they hope to be able to suffocate the "enemy" more confidently than before when needed.

<h3 id="e44">Foreigners in Hankou: The Japanese Firmly Refuse to Allow Departure; Possible Detention as Hostages if European War Breaks Out; The Drinking Water in the French Concession Will Also Become a Serious Problem <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, a foreigner who came to Shanghai from Hankou last week, yesterday (the 12th) told a reporter that the turbulent flow of the Yangtze River has risen to the highest level recorded this season, and the condition of the river dikes is poor, so there is a possibility that Hankou will become a swamp. Whether the early rise in river water will lead to flooding, or whether the torrent will fall before the usual rise in water, cannot be predicted at present. Last autumn, the Chinese army built fortifications on the river dikes, which weakened the dikes' resistance. Strangely enough, while Hankou is encountering this situation, the problem of sufficient water supply in the French Concession is gradually becoming serious. Since the Japanese cut off the connection between the French Concession and the Hankou Municipal Water Plant on the Han River, the residents of the French Concession have been relying entirely on a single pump to draw unfiltered Yangtze River water for survival. Coolies line up in front of the pump all day long, drawing muddy water. This muddy water is all that they can obtain. The lack of clean water and the threat of ever-latent epidemics may cause a serious situation in the summer. However, although the equipment is inconvenient, it is currently possible to obtain sufficient water. Regarding the possible spread of diseases in the hot summer, it is reported that the daily affairs bureau is now fully cooperating, preparing to fight the epidemic. As the clouds of war in Europe grow darker, there are more than a thousand foreigners stranded in Hankou, all of whom may be detained as hostages if war breaks out. When asked why more foreigners have not left Hankou, the foreigner's explanation was quite alarming. It is said that over 130 foreigners have tried to leave Hankou in recent weeks, but the Japanese have resolutely refused to allow them passage. According to the Japanese military, this is due to "the uncertain situation." However, the foreigner and other foreigners in Hankou are convinced that there is a more important reason. Foreigners in Hankou are practically prisoners. If war breaks out in Europe, the Japanese will immediately arrest all the British and other foreign nationals in the area. As for the economic situation in Hankou, business is extremely depressed, and the market is full of Japanese goods. When the foreigner left Hankou, the Japanese authorities ordered foreigners to hand over all [lacuna] refugee shelters within a week. It is not known whether this measure has been implemented.</p>

On the night of the 6th, a large number of Japanese and puppet troops launched a night raid on the guerrilla teams outside Xiaoximen, apparently to break the communication between the Chinese army at Dianshan Lake and relieve the siege of Zhujia Ge, the chief town. When the Japanese and puppet troops passed Wan Jing Bridge, they were spotted by a guerrilla team sentry, who quickly reported to the troops. Therefore, when the Japanese and puppet troops arrived at Jinjia Bridge, they were ambushed by the guerrilla teams. More than half of the Japanese and puppet troops died. At about 3:00 AM, the Japanese garrison in the city hurriedly drove motorboats to reinforce them, but the Japanese troops had no will to fight and retreated to Qingcheng on the boats. The guerrilla teams, seeing that their goal had been achieved, did not pursue them.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Education Minister Chen Lifu Discusses the Position of Music in Education: Encouraging Young People to Follow It and Advance <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) Education Minister Chen Lifu recently wrote an article discussing the position of music in education. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The goal of education is to cultivate young people with moral, intellectual, and physical education, so that they can achieve this mission. It cannot be denied that what is achieved does not necessarily have to be practical talent, and what is focused on does not necessarily have to be useful learning. The reason is that the effort to practice stillness is used instead of practicing movement, and the effort to implement is spent on learning literature. The crux of the matter can be summarized in one sentence: music has lost its position in education.</p>
<p>In the history of our country, the periods when literature and education were most prosperous must be said to be the Zhou Dynasty. When discussing the saint of teachers for all generations, it must be said to be Confucius. The teachings of the Zhou Dynasty were that the learning and administration of the state were in the hands of rites and music. The teachings of Confucius were that the subjects of instruction were first the Six Arts, and in the Taibo chapter there is a saying "established by poetry, stood by rites, completed by music," then music is the way to complete education. Taken together, the importance of music in education at that time can be seen.</p>
<p>After the Qin and Han dynasties, ancient music was lost, and rites and teachings alone prevailed in the world. The drawbacks were that they emphasized formality and neglected practicality, and were biased towards conservatism and laxity in initiative. Eventually, rites and teachings only remained formal. As a result, rites collapsed and music was ruined, and the foundation of the state was shaken, and the performance of the people declined. Neglecting practicality meant that the sciences of utilizing resources and benefiting people, and new knowledge could not be produced. Old learning was also lost for a long time. Laxity in initiative meant that the nation gradually became old, and society also became lethargic. The country, which was the first to be civilized and had a long history, was then turned around and lagged behind in everything and regressed in everything. What is even more heartbreaking is that various undesirable phenomena, such as depression, dispersal, confusion, and licentiousness, were revealed as weaknesses, and national morality was completely wiped out, so that the country, which had been called the land of rites and music for five thousand years, was almost no longer a country.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, in order to save the crisis of the country and the nation, it is necessary to restore the position of music in education. The original purpose of music is to guide the vigorous vitality of young people and complete it within collective action. The sounds of bells and chimes are different from gold and stone, but they can harmonize in pitch. The dances of thousands of feathers have different styles in civilian and military affairs, but they are orderly in advancing and retreating, just like the personalities of young people. Although they are different, they can cooperate in group life as long as everyone uses their talents to the fullest. Music focuses on movement, and movement results in more development. Rites focus on stillness, and stillness results in the power of stability. The distorted development of past education was not worried about the inability to be still, but worried about the inability to move. Therefore, the promotion of music should be used to invigorate and inspire, to straighten the depressed ranks, to tidy up the scattered ranks, to make advances and retreats uniform, to manage the confused ranks, to make peace and harmony, and to correct the licentious ranks. This will perhaps lead to the cultivation of a habit of moving, the arousal of a love for practical science, the development of practical science, the cultivation of a spirit of initiative, in order to restore the inherent morality of the people and catch up with the ever-changing knowledge and abilities.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has been going on for twenty months, and the certainty of victory is increasing day by day. The international situation is improving. From the mutual trust of the people, to the strengthening of the nation's self-confidence, and from the nation's self-confidence, to the promotion of the common trust of friendly countries, the development of the spirit of unity is the most important thing. The purpose of music is to attach to all people, because it is deeply moving, and its way comes from nature. Therefore, one singing can lead to a hundred harmonies, and in the process of subtle transformation, it can achieve the effect of responding to the request for sound and qi, and encourage the people, inspire morale, strengthen their loyalty to the common enemy, and create their courage to kill the enemy and achieve results. It is also an urgent need in wartime. The Marseillaise had no small impact on the success of the French Revolution. This is a clear effect that can be seen. Therefore, in response to the needs of wartime, music education must also be promoted urgently.</p>
<p>Therefore, the prosperity of music education led to the flourishing of education in the Zhou Dynasty, and the decline of music education led to the daily increase of the crisis of the nation. The causes and effects are different, but the facts are the same. If education is on the right track, and young people are encouraged to follow it and advance, then music is the driving force. If this is examined, then the position of music in education does not need to be stated in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Announcement of Opening Dates for Various Grass Tennis Competitions This Year. Grass Court Association to Revise Various Rules. A General Assembly to be Held Again at the West YMCA on the 26th. <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grass Tennis Association held its first committee meeting the other day at the West YMCA. In addition to deciding on the deadline for registration and opening dates for the Group A and B league and championship matches this year, they also discussed the issue of rule revisions. Many revisions were proposed this time, and it was decided that a temporary general assembly of all committee members (not the second committee meeting) will still be convened at the West YMCA on the 26th of this month (Wednesday) to make a decision. The various points of revision raised for discussion at the committee meeting the other day will solicit opinions from members of various associations and clubs and be submitted for discussion at the temporary general meeting. The proposal to adopt a modified double round-robin system for the Group A league was rejected. (According to reports, this proposal was put forward by Klinuo at the last annual meeting and was only for Group A; yesterday's report mistakenly stated it was for Groups A and B.) The committee also resolved to continue to use Slazenger balls as the official balls for this year's competitions. Furthermore, the previous regulation that all weeks of the previous championship, except for the Men's Novice Singles, the remaining Men's Advanced Singles, Men's Doubles, Mixed Doubles, Women's Singles and Doubles, and International Robb Cup Doubles, were to be held at the Association Tennis Courts on Xiafei Road on designated dates, has been cancelled for this year. As the Association Tennis Courts are overused and damaged, and limiting the use to one court affects the progress of the competition, it was decided that for this year's championships, except for the semi-finals and finals, which will be held at the Association Tennis Courts on designated dates, the remaining weeks will still be arranged by the players themselves to compete at various courts. Registration for each competition opens today. The officially announced deadlines for registration and opening dates of each competition by the association are listed below:</p>
<p>Competition Name Deadline for Registration Opening Date Registration Fee</p>
<p>Group A League May 6th June 21st 10 yuan</p>

<h3 id="e58">Finance: Hong Kong and Xiamen Banks Continuously Purchase, Spot Price Without Glory or Disgrace <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot silver market still showed little change. Throughout the day, it hovered within the 2,070 yuan range, with the sluggish trend showing an initial rise followed by a fall, purely shifting based on the amount of supply and demand. Initially, although silversmiths, gold shops, and money exchanges were selling quite a bit, the American market was generally stable and slightly soft. With strong buying from Hong Kong banks, coupled with Xiamen banks and spot silver shops tracking and purchasing, the underlying trend was relatively stable for a time. Later, when the customer banks stopped buying and the money exchanges continued to sell, the situation turned sluggish. In the end, there was no clear winner or loser. Major local players remained cautious and watched. Trading was quite active in the morning, reaching around 800 taels, but turned quiet in the afternoon, with only 50 taels traded. Silversmiths' jewelry gold rebounded by one yuan. Customs gold was stagnant. Chinese-British pure gold and others rose slightly.</p>
<p>Spot Silver Suddenly Returns to Flat After Rising</p>
<p>From the early morning, it was reported that the American exchange rate showed a general stable and slightly soft underlying trend, and Hong Kong banks had strong buying interest. Coupled with a certain gold shop also tracking and purchasing on behalf of Xiamen banks, sellers raised prices and sold. At 9:50 AM, a certain silversmith (on behalf of Hong Kong banks) first purchased 50 taels each from fellow silversmiths and gold shops, all at 2,067 yuan, which was the opening price, three yuan higher than the previous close. After the opening, a certain gold shop purchased 100 taels from silversmiths at the same price as the morning opening. Subsequently, a spot silver shop also purchased 100 taels from silversmiths at the same price. Later, a certain silversmith purchased another 100 taels from gold shops, still at 67 yuan. Silversmiths then sold 50 taels to gold shops, also at 67 yuan. Afterwards, money exchanges mutually traded 50 taels, rising to 69 yuan. A certain silversmith then purchased 50 taels from fellow silversmiths, at the same price. Before long, a certain silversmith purchased another 100 taels from money exchanges, at 68 yuan and 67 yuan. Later, Yuhao sold 50 taels to silversmiths, also at 67 yuan, which was the noon close price. In the afternoon, due to buyers stopping their purchases and watching, and money exchanges continuing to dump, the situation turned sluggish. However, trading was extremely quiet, with only 50 taels seen sold by money exchanges to silversmiths at 2:30 PM, at a price of 64 yuan. There was no trading activity afterwards, so the evening close was still 2,064 yuan. As a result, there was no glory or disgrace compared to the previous night's close. The selling price of the spot silver shop's own-brand gold was 2,070 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,060 yuan. The spot silver standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Changes to 210 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silversmiths' jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. But at 10:00 AM, due to the stable trend of spot silver under the purchase of customer banks, the price was raised by one yuan. Datonghang changed to 210 yuan, and Xintonghang changed to 208 yuan, with a purchase price of 202 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pound Weak, Pure Gold Rises Slightly</p>
<p>London, 11th telegram: British pure gold rose by half a penny (per ounce) due to the weakness of the British pound and more buyers, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pennies. The Central Bank's cash purchase price for Chinese was also 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 3 jiao, reaching 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Calm Exchange Market <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market saw active purchasing and settlements by Indian Commercial Bank Corporation and major foreign firms. However, foreign banks had good intentions for supplying British exchange. But the American exchange rate was selling less smoothly due to the weakening of the British-American exchange rate. Therefore, the situation was stable and slightly soft at one point. In the end, it relied on Hong Kong telegrams and Tianjin banks simultaneously selling, causing the situation to turn stable. As a result, there was still no glory or disgrace. Trading was still active. Hong Kong telegrams purchased British, Sai, and American currencies, with the calculated British-American exchange rate at 4 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen, and 0.1 hao. The Hong Kong exchange rate's underlying trend weakened as foreign banks' absorption strengthened.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the recent London big bills remained flat, while the long-term bills rose by 0.125. The New York silver price was stagnant as before. London raw gold rose by half a penny. The exchange rate of British to American was down by 0.6 hao, unchanged against Shanghai, and down by 4 centimes against France. American to British was down by 0.0625, unchanged against Shanghai, and up by 0.0625 against France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The morning opening selling price of British exchange was 8 pence 25, and the American exchange rate was 16 yuan 0625, both flat compared to the previous night's close. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams suddenly purchased British, Sai, and American currencies, with the calculated British-American exchange rate at 4 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen, and 0.1 hao. Foreign banks HSBC and MacCallum sold to Hong Kong telegrams (exchange arbitrage). The Indian Commercial Bank Corporation and foreign firms purchased British exchange at 8 pence 25, with little change in the situation. HSBC's listed exchange rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also announced as unchanged, still at a slight percentage of 0.00. Afterwards, foreign banks were less willing to sell American exchange, making settlements difficult for a time. But soon, Hong Kong telegrams and Dajin banks mutually dumped, so it returned to flat. Hong Kong telegrams (exchange arbitrage) and Yuli (on behalf of Tianjin banks) and the Netherlands sold American exchange at 16 yuan 0625 to the Indian Commercial Bank Corporation and foreign firms, so the situation was stable. Nearing noon, money exchanges sold Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan 125 to foreign bank Andar, also flat. At the noon close, the bank selling price was 8 pence 25 for British exchange, 16 yuan 0625 for American exchange, and 56 yuan for Hong Kong exchange.</p>
<p>The afternoon trading turned quiet, with only foreign firms slightly settling accounts. Thus, the situation became more stable. Foreign firms settled with Jiufeng at 8 pence 25, while there was no activity heard for American exchange, and the price remained stable. Finally, Chinese banks mutually traded Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan 125. At the evening close, the bank selling price was 8 pence 25 for British exchange, 16 yuan 0625 for American exchange, and 56 yuan for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, compared to the previous close, British and American exchange remained unchanged, while Hong Kong exchange tightened by 0.125.</p>

<p>Down 1 Jiao 2-3 Fen Compared to the Beginning of the Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell by 0.0625. Local foreign exchange saw strong demand from foreign firms, and various banks provided ample supply. The market price was stable as before. Spot silver opened firm, with Xiamen banks continuing to absorb, and gold shops and retail investors following suit, boosting morale and strengthening the momentum. However, money exchanges and silversmiths took advantage of the high prices to sell, gradually weakening the momentum. In the afternoon, money exchanges exerted their remaining strength, frequently selling. Xiamen banks stopped buying, retail demand was scarce, and rumors spread of a new British loan being established, softening the market price. Although there was significant volatility throughout the day, the result was still equal to zero, with little glory or disgrace compared to the previous night. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, continued to see the wealthy tend to emigrate, with less demand for British gold pounds. British and American gold notes saw strong demand from various foreign firms, and money exchanges provided ample supply. Trading was brisk. Hong Kong notes weakened again, with money exchanges selling diligently, which were absorbed by foreign banks. Korean currency was the weakest, having fallen within 9 jiao and 2 fen, down 1 jiao 2-3 fen compared to the beginning of the year, reflecting the weakness of their financial system. Association trading was extremely rare, with only Yongfeng and Changtai selling 100 silver shillings each, which were purchased by Tongyuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds down 2 jiao, American gold pounds up 2 jiao, American gold notes up 3 fen, Hong Kong notes down 4 li, Philippine notes down 1 fen, and all other currencies unchanged.</p>

<p>The securities grey market remained firm yesterday, with the trend still shifting from weak to firm. This indicates that floating shares are gradually decreasing. The situation on the trading floor is still dominated by long positions, and short positions are unwilling to easily cover. However, the situation in Europe has eased, temporarily avoiding a split. The Sino-Japanese war is gradually showing more benefits than harm, and the public generally views it positively. Government bonds, especially Type A, are the most sought after because they have the smallest amount, the most draws, and the shortest term. Therefore, cunning investors feel that taking long positions in Type A is the most cost-effective. Investment and speculation are flocking to it. The market price was extremely stable after the opening, with Shuikang absorbing the most Type A bonds. Tianniu absorbed the most Type E bonds. Tianniu remains true to its original intention, selling Type B and buying Type D. Tongkanghao sells Type D and buys Type C, each with their own considerations. Shunheng, Yongfeng, and No. 11 sold more, and the market sentiment was flat. The market was firmer in the afternoon. Type A continued to advance, and Yuankang and No. 614 continued to buy as before. Retail investors also engaged in this type of trading, making the margin even scarcer. No. 38 bought Type C and sold Type E, because the former was cheap and the latter was expensive. No. 20 bought broadly. The market price resulted in mixed gains and losses, with only Type A rising by 0.25 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of the Bank of Communications were traded at a price of 12.50 yuan per share.</p>
<p>According to a report from the All Trades Association, the stock market was calm and firm. Currently, due to the uncertain situation, people are hesitant and cautious, waiting to see what happens after British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech is delivered before buying or selling. Shanghai Banking Corporation, Jardine Matheson, and Wheelock &amp; Co. shares saw active trading. Tram and public bus shares still attracted buyers. Company bonds remained firm due to loose credit and those seeking to profit from it. Rubber shares showed slight activity, but prices were not strong.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds on the 12th of this month (Wednesday) listed market prices saw only the Crisp Loan falling by half a pound, with a price of 36.5 pounds.

<h3 id="e66">Cotton Yarn: Actual Sales and Speculators Both Active; Hope for Revival of 20-Count Yarn; However, Mill Offerings of Futures are Also Strong; Daily Consumption of Cotton Yarn is Huge, and Prices are Rising <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market remains calm and quiet, yet with an advancing momentum, mainly because demand in South China is showing signs of improvement. Consequently, the market has seen increased activity in 20-count Double Horse yarn, for which available supply is tightening. As for 10-count coarse yarn in North China, transactions are surprisingly robust, and there are signs of insatiable demand. In reality, goods are scarce, and spot traders are engaging in speculative hoarding, further propelling market progress. Prices for 32-count and 42-count single yarn and two-ply thread are exceptionally stable, largely due to weak mill production. Some also say that the price of 10-count coarse yarn has already risen by more than 20 yuan compared to the end of last year, while the price of 20-count yarn has fallen by 10 yuan. Currently, with actual demand in the South picking up, 20-count yarn should be able to make a step forward. If sales orders continue to come, it is possible to return to the 400 yuan mark. In the afternoon, due to favorable conditions, wealthy speculators resumed hoarding, further bolstering market sentiment.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, at the start of the morning session, the market was still flat. As individual sellers made some sales, the asking price remained unchanged. 20-count Double Horse yarn was still trading at 392 yuan. Subsequently, due to active purchases of 20-count Double Horse and Heavenly Maiden yarn by the Hong Kong and Swatow merchants, prices gradually rose, and the market tightened. Some Yunnan merchants took profits and sold, causing slight weakness, but not enough to affect the market. By closing, prices had risen another step. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 394 yuan. In the afternoon, the market showed further strength, with Double Horse yarn rising again by 1.5 yuan, to 395.5 yuan. The price of Heavenly Maiden yarn reached 397 yuan. However, mills took advantage of the price increase to offer forward-month deliveries. As a result, various merchants bought a total of 2,890 bales. Prices for both 20-count Heavenly Maiden and Double Horse yarn rose by 2 to 3 yuan. Coarse yarn also rose by 2 to 3 yuan. Mill offerings were very substantial. Yong An Mill offered 1,500 bales of 20-count Special Golden City yarn for May delivery at a price of 395 yuan. De Feng Mill offered 100 bales of 16-count Variant Lion yarn at a price of 360 yuan. An Da Mill offered 200 bales of 20-count Flying Tiger yarn at a price of 388 yuan, and 100 bales of 10-count Flying Tiger yarn at a price of 305 yuan, for April-May delivery. Yong An Mill offered 50 bales of 10-count Special Ling City yarn at a price of 327 yuan. Xin He Mill offered 150 bales of 20-count Five Sons yarn at a price of 377 to 380 yuan. The total offering of these mills was 2,100 bales, with buyers paying a deposit of 40 yuan (cash) per bale. Today, 470 bales of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Swatow, 190 bales to Hong Kong, and 360 bales to Tianjin. The quantities purchased by various merchants are listed below:</p>
<p>The Japanese cotton yarn market also saw rising prices due to tight supply and the dominant long positions of large players, resulting in a strong market. In fact, consumption of this cotton yarn is high both in North China and in the guerrilla areas. The price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is above 360 yuan, and the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 359 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Mills Shifting Attention to Foreign Cotton; Domestic Cotton Prices Slightly Weaker; Issues with American Cotton Still Under Consideration <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The domestic cotton business is as lonely as a morning star, with mills showing no intention to act. In fact, overseas cotton markets have been falling frequently recently, and translated prices are becoming increasingly cheaper. Therefore, mills are focusing on American cotton. There is concern that domestic cotton prices should fall, but with inventories already low and sources affected by a certain party's control, the situation is awkward. Yesterday, selling prices weakened slightly. Supplies from northern Jiangsu are also slow. Only 451 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the docks. The state of cotton unification is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market is particularly weak. Although there is still no resolution to the issue of loan cotton from Washington, various methods are being considered, with particular emphasis on export and subsidy issues. This is the only way to release the loan cotton. "In recent days, Bombay merchants have been the main sellers in New York. The general cotton market can now enter a provisional state." A slight recovery may be seen in the next two days, but in the future, further declines are still common. Yesterday, New York fell by more than ten pounds. India, including forecasts, fell by half a rupee. Egypt fell by twenty pounds. Exchange rates showed no significant change. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices all fell. American and Brazilian cotton each fell by 8 jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 1.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Transactions are gradually becoming more active, but there are still no large transactions. Recently, Sino-Japanese mills have been opening a lot of cotton yarn, slightly resisting raw cotton. Yesterday, a total of 300 bales of Indian cotton and 500 bales of Brazilian cotton were imported. Other mills had no transactions. The Japanese mills have been quiet for many days, because they have already allocated their cotton quotas. The futures price of foreign cotton yesterday, converted to the delivery price to the mill, is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>The market trend yesterday was stable, with both spot sales to local customers being good. Due to seasonal factors, the spring and summer goods business has come together, and retail sales in local shops are very prosperous under the call for large spring discounts from various cloth shops. Larger stores each have sales exceeding 10,000 yuan per day. Purchases from downstream ports along the Yangtze River such as Jingjiang and Wuhu are also strong. Demand from Jiangxi and Guangdong is also strengthening. More than 1,500 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, pongee, bleached twill, and fine cloth were purchased. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan purchased several thousand bolts of foreign yarn, colored cloth, yarn, pongee, and bleached cloth. Cantonese merchants purchased nearly 2,000 bolts of colored cloth and colored twill. Sales of bleached and dyed cloth were flat. Sales prices of white goods, fine cloth, and coarse twill turned stable, and transactions were less frequent. However, Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth was priced cheaply for spot goods in the market, and wholesale dealers and peers continued to purchase more than 300 pieces. Sixteen-pound Double Elephant and Five Blessings brands rose by one jiao per bolt.</p>
<p>East Cloth</p>
<p>Fine cloth and fine twill were still weak in the morning market, but firmed up in the afternoon. Asking prices for various brands varied, and large orders were also stable. However, the prices of those shorting the market were five to ten fen lower than spot prices. This is because those focused on speculative trading differ from those doing real goods transactions. Yesterday, spot goods of Leading Fine Twill required 12.65 yuan, while futures only sold for 12.55 yuan. Fine cloth had no major changes. Local dyeing shops continued to sell 600 bales, and market prices remained high. Because the distance was too far, no orders were placed.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Today, 180 pieces of piece goods were exported to Swatow, 190 pieces to Tianjin, 160 pieces to Yantai, and 500 cotton blankets were shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Secret Strife in the Woolen Industry Begins with "Add Three Inches on the Yardage"; Hope for Uniformity <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market is most prosperous in the Chessboard Street area. There are six shops specializing in Chinese clothing: Da Lun, Xian Chang, Sheng Da Xiang, Fu Kang, Hong Xiang, and Wan Cheng Yan. Recently, Hong Xiang took the lead in creating "add three inches on the yardage." On Sundays, they even added free shoe vamp material and wireless radio advertising, etc., which was opposed by the other businesses. The reasons were (1) businesses have regulations of adding one inch; (2) the current business is more prosperous than in previous years, so there is no need to over-accommodate, reducing profits. But according to Hong Xiang, Xie Da Xiang, Bao Da Xiang, Xin Da Xiang, etc. are all adding three inches. If the woolen fabric industry continues to be old-fashioned and does not compete, the business may be taken away by the foreign goods industry. Therefore, both sides held their own reasons, and the secret battle was very fierce. Although the Woolen Fabric Industry Guild held an executive meeting to discuss and sent private mediators some time ago, they were not successful. Therefore, in recent days, those who add three inches have risen, and it is feared that there will be further competition soon, but this is not a blessing for the industry. It is hoped that there will be uniformity.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Food: Mill Flour Nominally Fixed, Actually Relaxed; Northern Merchants Continue to Order a Batch <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Mill Flour</p>
<p>The market for mill flour yesterday continued to show a nominally fixed, actually relaxed trend. Sales to local customers were generally lively. However, customers preferred to buy flour in the market with current cash, which was not too expensive and had a whiter color than mill flour. It is said that the Northern Merchants recently shipped a lot. Seeing this situation, the mills had to make some concessions to please customers. It is said that yesterday the Northern Merchants ordered another batch of No. 2 flour at a price of 4.475 yuan and 4.45 yuan. Because the selling price in the North was lower, brands like Cannon Cart were harder, so the price was slightly different for Green Soldier Ship and Precious Star. The selling price of No. 3 and No. 4 miscellaneous brands of flour also had a difference of 5 to 10 fen. The market has not been unified. The wholesale price on the street is still 4.4 yuan original price, because the mills indicate that they are still stable, but in fact, they have softened invisibly. Exports of flour today are 31,500 bags, shipped to Swatow, and 7,000 bags shipped to Yantai, and 3,500 bags of bran are shipped to Swatow.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour</p>
<p>The market was also stable yesterday, and sellers were less willing to compromise than in the previous two days, because recent sales to local customers have been quite lively. Most of the newly arrived goods have already been allocated. Except for medium-grade and miscellaneous brands that are being sold off cheaply, old brands such as Red Sun and that Day, and other popular brands that have strong sales to customers are sticking to their prices. It is said that yesterday there were new transactions of 20,000 to 30,000 bags with local customers. The domestic price is quite relaxed. The foreign price still requires US$2.545, and it is difficult to divide it up after fees, so orders from foreign firms continue to be quiet.</p>

<p>Supplies of wheat have been arriving in small amounts for several days, all shipped to Shanghai from the Yangtze River area, but the amount is still not large. Each factory's intake is because they have foreign wheat orders and domestic wheat shipped from the production area, they do not care about the odd supply in the market. However, a certain Japanese flour mill, etc., because there is no foreign wheat ordered, secretly bought it. It was heard that more than 300 bags of wheat from Jiangbei were opened yesterday, with prices ranging from 7.13 yuan to 7.1 yuan, similar to the previous board, and were all purchased by Japanese merchants. However, according to the seller, the wheat was still purchased by the customer gangs. It was investigated that 350 bags of wheat were shipped from the new port yesterday.</p>

<p>Customer xian has been arriving, and after the Qingming Festival, it has remained in a weak state. In the past few days, river boats have continued to arrive with whole batches, and grain merchants, Japanese merchants, and powder have set up shops to transport and sell them. In the future, the source of Anhui rice will continue to come in an endless stream. Yesterday, the line hoarders and customers were all stagnant, and only the original street picked up 1,000 bags of price goods, and the market price was immediately reduced by 1.5 to 2 jiao.</p>
<p>The sources of Tu rice for each gang, the lower reaches only arrive at the second and third number, the train wheel sentence, the Su Tong gang nearly 2,000 bags, the Kunshan gang and other 400-500 bags, to the sales ground, although there are sellers who have dropped prices to sell off, and the retail route is more sluggish than before, so all the goods are rarely made open, such as the thickness of the geng market has fallen by 1-2 jiao, Tu Yang Jian Bu Jian also fell by 1 jiao, Bian Yuan although the goods are scarce, but the route is slow, so the market is also tired.</p>

<p>Overseas silk markets: Yesterday, Yokohama spot prices rose by 35 yuan, and forward prices rose by 38 yuan. The spot price can be expected to directly knock on the 1100 yuan mark. New York silk at 83.75 points each rose by four points, and Shanghai silk still sold at the original price (according to New York silk prices rising by 1.1 yuan in the past three days, Shanghai silk is still sold at the original price). Lyon Japanese silk rose by 4.5 francs and Shanghai silk A grade remains unchanged (according to the rise in Japanese silk prices by 6.5 francs in Lyons over the past two days), 2B grade rose by one franc, Guangdong silk remains unchanged. In short, in recent days, the supply and demand relationship in the main raw silk sales market has been very tense. For example, in the past two weeks, New York raw silk has shown signs of being "tight," which is a reflection of this relationship. At the same time, this spring's production of raw silk in China and Japan is expected to decline further, so Yokohama and New York forward prices also rose yesterday. In addition, international situation is becoming more and more urgent, and the domestic war of resistance is almost reaching a stage of full-scale counter-offensive. All these factors have made the people in the East market sway, and whether the current Japanese cabinet can maintain the precarious situation and whether the Japanese yen is about to be officially devalued, etc., may promote a rapid rise in silk prices.</p>
<p>Domestic silk market: Yesterday, upon receiving news of price increases from Japan and the US, they were regarded as unexpected and deeply agitated. People's hearts have become more firm, but there are still doubts. It seems that although the foreign firm silk market rose by about 20 yuan yesterday, manufacturers generally held a wait-and-see attitude, so transactions were not prosperous. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson and other firms entered eight-five uniform degrees 20-22 silk mark 50 dan, seventy-eight uniform degrees 40 dan, the market price slightly fluctuated due to the previous day's telegram and the current day's current conversations.</p>

<p>The sugar market trend tightened yesterday. Foreign sugar prices from the Netherlands are reporting price increases, causing the Shanghai market to increase. The spot price for 24 coarse sand white sugar is 25.3 yuan, and transit goods are 17.1 yuan, with 300 bags traded. Taikoo Sugar, Puxi goods are 25.35 yuan, with sporadic transactions. Chao sugar opened with more than 50 bags of ordinary upper ice sugar, priced at 23.5 yuan, Chongtiqing with more than 50 bags priced at 14.95 yuan, and Tianjin Diaoqing is said to have off-market transactions.</p>

<p>The transaction of flat lead silk has been exceptionally active recently, so the city trend is unique in the mediocre steel market. The market price is strong because the new goods cannot keep up and the inventory is also dry, so its market form is exceptionally strong. For example, 2 points is estimated at 34.5 yuan per market dan, 2.5 points at 25 yuan, 3 points at 23.75 yuan, 3.5 points at 22.5 yuan, 4 points at 22 yuan. It was investigated that a total of 400-500 dan were opened in yesterday's market, mostly purchased by the factory and the Tianjin and Yantai gangs. As for the industry's separate purchases, there are very few.</p>

<p>The factory's yuan nails have been actively purchased and transacted by customers, construction gangs, and local industries, and the transactions are extremely considerable. On the previous day, a total of 1,500-1,600 buckets were opened, which were opened by the iron industry on North Suzhou Road, and the market price was 17 yuan per bucket of Bessie. For example, one inch is 2.7 yuan per bucket, 1.25 inches is 2.2 yuan per bucket, 1.5 inches is 1.5 yuan, 2 inches is 1 yuan, 1.5 inches is 7 jiao, 3 inches is 6 jiao, 3 plus half inches is 6 jiao, 4 inches is 5 jiao, 5 inches is 2-3 jiao, 5.5 inches and 6 inches is 3 jiao, 7 inches is 1.5 yuan, 4.5 inches are not added and other small patterns such as 4 points sell for 26 yuan, 5 points sell for 31 yuan, and 6 points sell for 26 yuan, plus taxes, which are purchased in large quantities by the Tianjin gang, and other architectural interests and local industries are also slightly embellished.</p>

<p>Galangal fruits are produced in Guangzhou and Hainan Island. Since the two regions have been occupied successively, transportation is difficult, and the supply has been cut off for a long time, so the selling price has been raised to 45 yuan one after another. Recently, all the gangs have been actively procuring, and there is a shortage of supply. For example, the transaction price was 50 yuan per dan, and if there is no arrival, it seems that it needs to continue to rise.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Wusong: Japanese Soldiers Surrender with Weapons; Guerrilla Forces in the Area Will Accept Them; Surrendering Japanese Soldiers are All Young Soldiers <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Two Japanese soldiers stationed in Wusong suddenly surrendered to the guerrilla forces in the area with weapons last night (the 12th), and were accepted. When asked why they surrendered to the guerrilla forces, they said that they could not bear the oppression of the warlords who forced them to fight against China, and that they would become ghosts in a foreign land in this life, with no hope of returning to their country. Even their life in Shanghai was such that they could not get three meals a day on time. They also said that the number of casualties in the Japanese army since the outbreak of the July 7th Incident has exceeded one million. The two Japanese soldiers are all young.</p>
<p>Annihilation of Japanese Soldiers in Guanyintang Town: Guanyintang Town, which belongs to Qingpu County between Xujing and Huangdu, has hundreds of town residents. Recently, fearing that guerrillas were hiding there, the Japanese stationed more than ten Japanese soldiers. At about 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, while the Japanese soldiers were having breakfast, they were surrounded and attacked by the local guerrilla forces. The Japanese soldiers were caught off guard, and all ten soldiers were annihilated. Two machine guns, more than ten rifles, and many bullets were seized on the spot. When the Japanese soldiers in Huangdu Qingpu City heard about it, they joined forces and dispatched hundreds of Japanese soldiers to rush to the scene. The guerrilla forces had already left.</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported to Shanghai: Recently, a large number of wounded Japanese soldiers have been transported to Shanghai in the Yangtze River and are being accumulated in various military hospitals. Because there are not enough Japanese transport ships to be dispatched, it is still difficult to transfer all of them back to Japan at once. Yesterday morning, two batches had already returned to Japan across the sea. The first batch, numbering more than 4,000 people, was exported from Shanghai by the Japanese merchant Huangwan at 9:00 a.m. and transported six truckloads of corpses, about 3,000 boxes, each box containing one corpse. Outside the wooden box, there was another layer of white cloth. The second batch of more than 2,000 wounded soldiers boarded the Rui Sui Maru at the Osaka Wharf of the Japanese merchant in Pudong and set off for Japan at 11:00 a.m. It was also heard that more than 10,000 wounded soldiers were still gathered in the temporary military stations of the Shanghai Shupu Yong An Yarn Factory and the Liaoyang Road Yapu Ear Bulb Factory, waiting for transport ships to transport them back to China. This shows that after the Sino-Japanese War entered the second stage, the situation changed and the number of soldiers who died or were wounded on the battlefield increased sharply compared to the first stage.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Destroyed and Sent to Shanghai for Repairs: At about 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, a Japanese destroyer was towed into the Huangpu River and entered the South Huangpu River Shipbuilding Plant for repairs. The warship was bombed in the Yangtze River by the Chinese Air Force, and the stern was hit and seriously injured. The deck was severely damaged. When it passed the Bund of the 16th Concession, it stopped at the Duchen Road crossing for a moment.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily News reported: Yesterday (the second day above), it was learned that the American Advisory Committee had allocated approximately 194,000 yuan last week to conduct relief projects in various departments of "free" and "occupied" China.

Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province and Puzhou (phonetic translation) in Anhui Province each received 10,000 yuan. Yancheng in Henan Province, Qingjiangpu in Jiangsu Province, and Yancheng each received 5,000 yuan. Xixing (phonetic translation) in Zhejiang Province was also allocated 4,000 yuan. As of the end of last year, the committee had allocated approximately 3,249,000 yuan. Since January 1 of this year, the committee has been spending approximately 100,000 yuan per week to provide relief. According to a member of the committee who spoke to reporters, the committee has been responding to all legitimate requests for relief funds to date.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the blockade of Zhenhai Port on the 5th of this month, any ships have been strictly prohibited from entering. However, the current situation in Ningbo is extremely peaceful. There have been no Japanese aircraft entering the country for reconnaissance this month, and business is still thriving. However, commodity prices have generally increased, and there is sufficient food in storage, so there is no fear of a shortage in three months. However, no one has yet made a request for the resumption of Shanghai-Ningbo shipping, so it will be difficult to do so in the short term. However, it is believed that after the Zhejiang Bureau gradually relaxes, the authorities will promulgate shipping measures that take both transportation and defense into consideration, so that travelers can travel conveniently and freight can be transported smoothly.</p>

<p>(News from this city) The US Naval Authorities in Shanghai claim that the Commander of the US Asian Fleet, Yan Luer, is scheduled to travel to Hankou via Nanjing on the flagship "Isabel" on the 15th, taking six days en route, for a total journey of 21 days. He will arrive in Hankou on the 26th and return to Shanghai. The official purpose of Yan Luer's trip has not been announced, but it is generally believed that the authorities are inspecting the situation on the Yangtze River, similar to Yan's previous inspection of the Yangtze River with the US Consul General in Shanghai. In addition, the US warship "Guam" also plans to sail to Hankou on the same day to rotate with the "Oahu." The "Oahu" will escort the "Isabel" back to Shanghai along the way. The US Naval Authorities emphatically stated that Yan Luer's trip has no political significance.</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Japanese Requested the Municipal Council to Ban Anti-Japanese Newspapers, Using the Spirit of Understanding as a Pretext; No Mention Was Made of Anti-Foreign Propaganda in the Japanese Newspapers <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Press reported that the Japanese Consul General Miura requested the General Director of the Public Works Bureau, Fan Keling, yesterday (the 12th) to take action against anti-Japanese magazines and newspapers published in the Public Concession. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated last night when receiving reporters from various newspapers that the request was made in accordance with the spirit of understanding recently obtained by the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities. However, when asked if there were newspapers in Japan that published anti-foreign propaganda, the spokesman replied that it was "another question." When a reporter asked whether Fan Keling had raised the issue of anti-foreign content in Japanese newspapers during his meeting with Miura, the spokesman replied in the negative, adding that the Japanese side had not mentioned the names of any specific newspapers. The request made to Fan concerned general anti-Japanese newspapers, the important ones being Chinese-language newspapers. When a reporter asked the spokesman whether the phrase "the main ones are Chinese-language newspapers" meant that any English-language newspapers had been mentioned, the spokesman replied that, as previously stated, it concerned general newspapers. According to the spokesman's statements, "after occupying Shanghai for more than a year," the Public Concession still publishes certain publications, such as newspapers and magazines, that engage in anti-Japanese propaganda. These publications are guided by agencies acting on behalf of the Chongqing government to promote resistance against Japan. After holding a meeting to discuss the matter, especially as it affected the maintenance of peace and order in the Public Concession, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, visited the Director General of the Public Works Bureau, Fan Keling, and presented a memorandum containing the request to control anti-Japanese newspapers in Shanghai in order to comply with the spirit of understanding recently obtained by the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities. According to Miura, Fan Keling said that he was well aware of the Japanese authorities' views and agreed to take the necessary measures to control the publications. Fan Keling told reporters last night that he had received a memorandum from Miura yesterday afternoon, but according to Fan, he had not made a statement to the Japanese Consul General and had never damaged the reputation of the Municipal Council.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese side controlled the shipping in the ports of the Yangtze River up and down (a few ports in North Jiangsu are still in the hands of the Chinese army), the Japanese Qing Company sent vessels to run, because they were within the scope of special violence, and the goods in and out of each industry were forcibly loaded and transported by Japanese vessels, resulting in the original foreign vessels of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, etc. operating in each port. , the business plummeted and the number of flights was reduced successively. According to the shipowners who spoke to the Modern News reporter, since Japanese vessels started operating and competing in various ports along the river, foreign vessels have been subject to all kinds of harsh restrictions by the Japanese military authorities, and the cargo freight has been light, with many vessels reducing flights and suspending flights. If this continues, it is feared that in two or three months, they will be completely seized by the Japanese side.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, our country's import and export goods have been diverted to Myanmar, Yangon, and Vietnam through defense. Today, the transportation of goods in the above-mentioned areas has increased sharply. It is heard that British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have decided to increase the number of merchant ships in response to requests from various customs declaration firms. Regarding Shanghai, due to the small number of direct flights and the large number of special cargo shipments, the various shipping companies and customs declaration firms have negotiated to adopt a allocation system for loading and transportation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economy, in response to the re-branding of Japanese goods for sale in various locations, has sent telegrams to the governments of Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces, instructing them to conduct strict investigations and bans according to the law. The telegram states: "We have recently received a document from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, forwarded by the Executive Committee of Guangxi Province, stating that a large number of enemy goods are entering through Wenzhou and being transported to Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Guangxi, where they are being re-branded and sold as domestic goods. They request that a strict investigation and ban be ordered." The Ministry has investigated and determined that enemy goods disguised as national goods or goods from other countries should be investigated and banned by local authorities and customs checkpoints according to the regulations for banning enemy goods. There are also explicit penalties for merchants who re-brand, transport, and sell enemy goods. The Ministry should announce and specify the names and trademarks of enemy goods, but the names and trademarks of re-branded enemy goods change frequently. If local enforcement agencies discover such re-branded enemy goods and, after investigation, confirm that they are enemy goods but the names and trademarks have not yet been announced by the Ministry, they should first handle the matter according to the regulations and then report to the Ministry for verification. Therefore, in addition to sending telegrams to order the ban, we are also sending a telegram to your provincial government, requesting that you instruct the local authorities to strictly enforce the ban according to the law and report the progress of the investigation at any time.</p>

<p>After Japanese warships detained nine Portuguese merchant ships, despite protests from the Portuguese Consul-General, there has been no news of their release. Yesterday, the Portuguese ship "Fulu" of the Zhengde Company arrived in Shanghai from Beisha and was also detained by the Japanese. Passengers have been released. The detained shipping companies have requested permission to unload cargo first. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Companies Request Permission to Unload First: The nine Portuguese merchant ships "Meida," "Tanglu," "Tangbei," "Tangqiao," "Hailong," "Libao," "Bide," "Baode," and "Dade" are anchored at Yangshupu buoys under the supervision of Japanese warships. Each ship has one Japanese soldier stationed on board, ostensibly for protection but actually for surveillance. Although passengers have been completely released, the cargo has not yet been unloaded. Because cargo owners are eager to take delivery, shipping companies have requested the Portuguese Consul-General to negotiate with the Japanese to allow the unloading of cargo.</p>
<p>Still Not Released After Protests: Despite protests by Portuguese Consul-General Alves to Japanese Consul-General Miura, there was no news of their release yesterday. The Portuguese ships previously detained by the Japanese have also not been returned. These include "Vila Real," "Coimbra," "Timo," and "Mairia." It is said that "Coimbra" has been renamed "Haimen Maru," and "Mairia" has been renamed "Nantong Maru." "Vila Real" is managed by the Japanese company Nisshin, while "Timo" remains detained in Taiwan.</p>
<p>"Fulu" Detained, Passengers Released: The Portuguese ship "Fulu" of the Zhengde Company, represented by Datong Heji, operates on the Beisha route. Yesterday, at 2:30 PM, it arrived in Shanghai from Haimen. It intended to dock at the Bund wharf on Wuma Road, but when passing Yangshupu, it was signaled by a Japanese warship to stop and was detained. It is now anchored at buoys number two and three on the Huangpu River. Approximately one hundred passengers who arrived in Shanghai from Haimen requested permission from the shipowner, and last night, a Japanese warship sent a small boat to transport them to the Xinguanshi wharf to disembark. However, the cargo and crew remain on board.</p>
<p>Portuguese Ships Suspend Operations Until Dispute is Resolved: Portuguese shipping companies have decided to temporarily suspend all Portuguese shipping operations until the detained Portuguese ship incident is resolved. The Portuguese ships currently anchored in Shanghai and Wenzhou include "Tangsai," "Meida," "Xinde," "Damao," "Fade," "Wanguo," and "Shantai," either docked at wharves or anchored at buoys. The losses for Portuguese merchants are substantial. As for the Portuguese ship "Deyao," represented by the Italian company Yihua, it sailed as usual from Shanghai to Beisha yesterday.</p>
<p>Preparing to Charter Ships to Send Dinghai Passengers: Because the "Lishi" ship on the Ningbo-Dinghai route was detained in Shanghai, more than 240 passengers from Dinghai were stranded. The Dinghai Association and Zhengde Company planned to charter ships to send them back to their hometown. Zhengde Company has chartered the German ship "Gaoden" from the German company Lulin. However, according to reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Dinghai County Magistrate, because Dinghai is a prohibited port, has requested instructions from the Ningbo Defense Commander and General Liu of the Second Army Group regarding the plan to charter ships to send the stranded passengers back to Dinghai.</p>
<p>Detained Mail Already Returned: The Portuguese ships "Meida" and "Hailong" were carrying mail, either from Shanghai to Wenzhou or from Wenzhou to Shanghai. After negotiations with the Japanese authorities by the postal authorities, permission has been granted to return the mail first. It is reported that the post office has sent personnel to return the mail. The mail from Shanghai to Wenzhou has been transported to Wenzhou by other ships. Yesterday, the foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou were the Italian ship "Binli" of the Italian company Yihua and the German ship "Feikang" of the German company Lulin. As for the German ship "Deping" of the Italian company Zhongyi and the German ship "Haifu" of the German company Lihe, they are scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, upon hearing that the Chinese residence at 448 Haig Road was to be converted into a casino, requested the Police Department to erect barbed wire barricades in front of the house on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The patrolmen directing the work were still guarding the barricades yesterday (the 12th). About twenty Chinese workers and several Taiwanese people are still surrounded inside the house. It is said that they have stored at least a week's worth of food inside. The house was formerly occupied by the Li Guojie family. The current tenant is a Taiwanese person who has gone to Macau and not returned. The patrolmen have notified the people inside that they are allowed to leave the house at any time, but as of last night, they had not left the house. The Police Department has never erected barricades at the entrances of any casino outside the concession before. It is said that this action was taken at the request of the Municipal Council after notifying the Japanese authorities. The Municipal Council's decisive and unprecedented action is due to the location of the house, which is adjacent to Hong'en Hospital to the north and near several schools.</p>

<p>Xiong Jiandong, the guerrilla commander of the six counties of Cen (Changshu), Jia (Ding), Tai (Cang), Kun (Shan), Qing (Pu), and Song (Jiang), came to Shanghai last month for official business and was arrested by the Japanese. After being taken to Hongkou, various sectors were very concerned about his fate. It was rumored that after being arrested by the Japanese, Xiong refused to become a traitor and be scorned by the Chinese people, which angered the Japanese and led to his execution. However, this has not been confirmed. According to investigations by reporters from the Xiandai News Agency and inquiries among Xiong's confidants, Xiong is currently detained in a special room in the Hongkou Japanese Military Police Headquarters. His relatives and friends have tried to arrange a meeting with Xiong, but because the Japanese guards are closely monitoring him, they could not talk. They could only communicate briefly through eye contact. Xiong has several wounds on his forehead, and his face is thinner than before, but his attitude is calm, as if this sacrifice has brought him supreme glory.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Xi Shitai Murder Case; Bystander Killed by Bullet; Japanese Newspapers Claim He Was the Murderer; Police Department Still Investigating <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>News Agency: Xi Shitai, a native of Dongting Mountain, Wuxian County, and secretary of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau," was shot and killed in front of the entrance of No. 6 Juyi Lane, Lloyd Road, at 9:15 AM on the 11th of this month. At the time, a bystander, Peng Fulin (23 years old), a native of Liyang, was also hit in the chest by a stray bullet. Peng immediately went to Shilong Hospital for treatment, but died in the hospital around 2:00 AM yesterday due to his injuries. The body has been sent to the mortuary for examination. At the same time, all Japanese newspapers in Shanghai carried reports yesterday claiming that Peng was one of the murderers of Xi. There were as many as five other people who went with him to assassinate Xi, and a mastermind named Yuan Dechang was directing from the side. Yuan is a key figure in the Pudong Guerrilla Force. Peng's younger brother, Jin Xia, Peng's friend Zhao Zhixiang, and another person surnamed Chen, who accompanied Peng to the hospital, were all participants in the murder of Xi, etc. This statement has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports: "We learned yesterday (the 12th) that detectives investigating the assassination of Xi Shitai on Tuesday morning have determined that the two people currently in custody are indeed related to the assassination. One of them, Peng Fulin, was seriously injured by a bullet in the abdomen and is currently being treated at Baolong Hospital. His condition is very critical, and the detectives have been unable to interrogate him. The other person was accompanying Peng to Baolong Hospital on Tuesday morning and was arrested in the hospital. The police have learned that the two were near the scene of the shooting on Lloyd Road. Peng was injured and did not seek help, but took a rickshaw to Baolong Hospital. The hospital doctor notified the police that a person with gunshot wounds had been admitted, which aroused suspicion. The detectives took the injured man's friend to the Laozha Police Station for interrogation. According to his statement, the police believe that the two are related to the shooting.</p>
<p>Although no specific information was given to the press yesterday, reporters learned that the injured man did hear gunshots injure a Chinese policeman. When the Chinese policeman was chasing the fleeing terrorists, he fired his gun and also injured one of them. No weapons were found on either suspect, so it is believed that at least one other person is involved in the case. At the same time, the police's ballistics experts are carefully examining the bullets removed from Xi's body and have discovered that this</p>
<p>weapon used</p>
<p>has no previous record in the history of the city's police. The city is currently conducting a city-wide search for other members of the terrorist group that planned the case. Peng is being guarded by police officers in the hospital to prevent anyone from communicating with him. As a result of the shooting on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Japanese military in China has criticized the Municipal Council for not following the Japanese proposals to prevent further violence in the Public Concession and stated that the work of the Municipal Council Police Department still has certain</p>
<p>shortcomings.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the two suspects were taken into police custody about twenty minutes after the shooting occurred. Also, the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that Peng Fulin died of his injuries at Shilong Hospital this morning (the 13th)."</p>

<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Nanshi refugee area was established when the National Army withdrew from Shanghai and has lasted for one year and four months. When it was first established, the situation in the suburbs of Shanghai was chaotic, and many residents of Nanshi did not have time to evacuate into the concessions. Father Jacquinot and other enthusiastic individuals, acting on humanitarian principles, appealed and established a safe refugee area in the Kunming joint concession. At one time, more than 100,000 people gathered to be rescued. Since then, the number has gradually decreased, and as of recently, there are still about 20,000 people. The method of providing supplies is to distribute rice once a day in each area. Each refugee receives a tin can of rice weighing about six ounces. The supply and administrative expenses are 20,000 yuan allocated monthly by the Relief Committee and about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan monthly from charity lotteries, which is still sufficient. However, recently, staff members of the office, such as Wu Yanxiu, have taken advantage of their positions to embezzle food supplies and engage in other corrupt practices. When Father Jacquinot learned of this, he was very angry. In addition to revoking the passes of these staff members, he has also dismissed them from their positions. These staff members are trying to incite unrest, but because the refugees are unwilling to be exploited, no incidents are likely to occur. Father Jacquinot has been inspecting the area for several days and has decided to conduct a thorough investigation to deter others. Currently, the situation in the area is still very good.</p>

<p>The entire fresh pork industry in Shanghai jointly issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "Our industry's pork companies have been operating in Nanshi, Wusong, Yangjing, and other places. Since the August 13th Incident in 1937, we have moved into the concessions. Our sole purpose is to facilitate the flow of goods and maintain the people's food supply. Since February 1939, we have been levying a small amount of tax to provide relief to refugees on a monthly basis, consistently following the right path to fulfill our national duty. However, recently, some have attempted to divide our industry's unity through inducement and coercion and distort our industry's solemn position in order to achieve their seductive goals. Such absurd behavior that disregards the greater good and seeks only self-interest has long been deeply hated by all industries in our country. Therefore, we specifically declare that the jointly named companies in our industry swear to uphold justice, resolve not to participate in any illegal organizations, and absolutely will not succumb to coercion by any powerful forces. This will remain unchanged until the seas run dry and the rocks crumble. We have all agreed and jointly sworn this oath, never to be negligent. The original and duplicate copies of the oath have been entrusted to designated personnel for safekeeping. Fearing that the outside world may not understand the truth, we are jointly issuing this declaration again to strengthen our line of defense and correct perceptions. We trust in the public's judgment."</p>
<h3 id="e96">Rumor that Puppet "Municipal Government" Will Be Reorganized Again; Fu Xiao'an Dismissed and Transferred; Gao Guanwu to Succeed as Puppet <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to sources within the puppet government, there will be a partial reorganization within the puppet "Municipal Government" at the end of this month. The puppet position of puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an is rumored to be in jeopardy again, and Gao Guanwu, the puppet "Mayor" of Nanjing, will succeed him in his post. The reason for the change is still the dissatisfaction of the Japanese special agencies with Fu. In February, Fu's rice bowl was originally supposed to be broken, with puppet "Secretary-General" Su Xiwu being promoted to replace him. Later, because Fu's activities in Ningbo were successful, Liang Hongzhi relayed the matter to the Japanese, using the pretext that the puppet "diplomacy" was in a period of tension and that the puppet "Mayor" should not be changed to avoid external influences. This proposal was temporarily shelved. Currently, Fu and Gao are in Tokyo, flattering the Japanese. However, disputes within the puppet "Municipal Government" have been frequent, and even middle and lower-level officials have been divided into Fu and Su factions, with severe infighting.

<p>The "Jiangsu Maru" ferry of the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company's Takahashi Line, which returned to Shanghai from Gaoqian the day before yesterday afternoon, carried a batch of last-train passengers at the Gaoqiao ferry terminal. At around 5:30 PM in the evening, when passing near the Japanese transport ship "Kitaura Maru" moored at buoy number three on the Lujiazui Pudong surface, a Blue Funnel Line ship from the Swire Shipping Company was coming from upstream. The "Jiangsu Maru," which was between the ship and the "Kitaura Maru," was moving too fast and could not avoid the collision. The bow of the "Jiangsu Maru" violently collided with the stern of the "Kitaura Maru." The iron bars and iron frames in the first-class cabin were completely destroyed, and the damage was severe. The "Kitaura Maru" suffered no damage because the hull of the warship was sturdy. When the accident occurred, the "Jiangsu Maru" was shaken violently, and its stern also damaged the stern of the Blue Funnel Line ship. Iron girders broke off and fell onto the deck of the "Jiangsu Maru." Fortunately, no one was injured. It is reported that the damage to the "Jiangsu Maru" itself is estimated to be 2,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Three Tenants Intimidate Second Landlord, Madam Pan, Who Falls to Her Death; Exploiting Her Daughter's Weakness, They Scheme to Usurp the Property; Police Investigate and Prosecute, Each Tenant Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Madam Pan, residing at No. 75, Alley 230, Xiamen Road, was originally the second landlord of the premises. During the August 13th Shanghai Battle, she took her daughter, Yan Sheng, to seek refuge elsewhere, entrusting the management of the house to her third tenant, Ningbo native Madam Cao Zhang, etc. After the war subsided in Shanghai, Madam Pan and her daughter returned to their former residence, but Madam Cao Zhang and the others had no intention of relinquishing control. As Madam Pan accumulated a substantial amount of unpaid rent, the primary landlord filed a lawsuit in court. After the two parties reached a settlement, Cao Zhang, colluding with the other three tenants, Wang Shangda and Zhu Yinzhang, encouraged Madam Pan to transfer the lease of the house to Zhang Yanqing, a Ningbo native, claiming that this would not only settle the rent debt but also leave her with surplus funds. However, Madam Pan, due to the meager transfer fee offered by the other party and the harsh conditions, was unwilling to agree. Unexpectedly, these individuals, exploiting the woman's weakness, resorted to threats and enticements. In mid-last month, it was suddenly discovered that all the documents related to the house had been stolen. Madam Cao Zhang and her group of men and women intensified their efforts, adding intimidation, threatening to make Madam Pan's head and body separate and throw them into the Huangpu River. Having lost all evidence of her status as the second landlord, and hearing such terrifying words daily, the woman went to Mr. Sun, a colleague of Zhang Yanqing in Tongchang Lane, Hainan Road, on the 23rd of last month, seeking assistance. Sun and his wife, Madam Shen, tried to comfort her, urging her not to fear these threats. However, the woman could not bear such provocation and committed suicide by jumping from the building at home that night, falling to her death. After the incident, the Laozha Police Station, upon receiving the report, sent detectives to investigate the cause of the woman's death. Believing that Madam Cao Zhang, Zhang Yanqing, Wang Shangda, and Zhu Yinzhang, four individuals (men and women) were unquestionably guilty, they were arrested and prosecuted for the crime of restricting freedom. After repeated interrogations by the First Special District Court and continued investigation by the police, Judge Zhong Qing opened a court session yesterday morning, ordering the four accused to be brought up for review. The deceased's thirty-eight-year-old daughter, Pan Yansheng, separately retained a lawyer to appear in court and file a civil lawsuit against the defendants, seeking compensation for losses. After her mother's death, the orphaned woman, without any support, is temporarily staying with the Sun family. The Sun and his wife specially testified to prove that Madam Pan had come to their home before her suicide, recounting the threats made by the defendants. The court then questioned the defendants and the lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police station and the defendant's lawyer concluded their arguments. Judge Zhong then sentenced Madam Cao Zhang, Zhang Yanqing, Wang Shangda, and Zhu Yinzhang to three months imprisonment each. If they chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at one yuan per day. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for review.</p>

<p>Recently, the Japanese military police team on Lincoln Road, West Shanghai, has been sending Japanese soldiers disguised as workers to arrest people everywhere. Yesterday morning, six or seven disguised Japanese soldiers arrested farmers Tian Baogen (resident of Yuangenglang, Zhongxin Jing West), Zhang Xiaodi (resident of Nanjiazhai, Hongqiao Road), Huang Jinrong (son of the shoeshine "Xiutang", resident of Xujiazhai, west of the ball court), and Yu Heshang (resident of Yujia Oil Mill, south of Hongqiao Town), suspecting them of being guerrillas. They were sent to the Japanese military headquarters on Lincoln Road for interrogation. However, because Yu had a pair of handcuffs on him, he was tied to the railway crossing on Hongqiao Road and executed by Japanese soldiers yesterday afternoon. The other three are still being detained. Also, after the manager of the Taishan Brick and Tile Company, "Little Ocean", (the company was founded by Chinese merchants but seized by the Japanese) was killed by guerrillas in a certain place a few days ago, Mori, the head of the propaganda unit of the Japanese army stationed in Beiqiao Town, Humin Road, learned of this and sent Japanese soldiers from Minhang to search Tan's residence behind Heda Temple. Villagers Gu Jinmao, Shen Aqiu, and Shen Akun were arrested. Later, Jin Atian, who ran a teahouse in Huajing Town, was also arrested and sent to the Minhang Japanese military headquarters for interrogation. The day before yesterday (11th), more than 30 Japanese soldiers, led by a traitor, went to the Xiaohong residence south of Tangwan Town and tied up and arrested Hong Guanping and Li Xuesheng, villagers residing in Bo Gouqiao.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Japanese Military Police Open Fire and Arrest Chinese People Outside of Avenue Bugeaud; Concession Authorities Have Not Received Formal Notification; Japanese Side Believes There Are a Large Number of "Rioters" in West Shanghai <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that shortly before 7 a.m. yesterday (12th), a team of Japanese military police opened fire on a group of Chinese people who looked suspicious in the "Avenue" area outside of Avenue Bugeaud, arresting 11 people and seizing two handguns. Both sides exchanged gunfire at the time, but as of late last night, it was still not known whether anyone was injured. This area has always been a hideout for "rioters." It is unknown whether the Japanese military police were conducting a search, resulting in an exchange of fire, or whether these Chinese people were all guerrillas planning to take action near gambling dens and opium dens in the western district. The Public Concession Police Authority replied yesterday that they had not received formal notification of the arrests and seizure of handguns, nor were they sent to the scene, as it was not under their jurisdiction. The number of Japanese military police involved in the shooting could not be confirmed last night, but it was believed to be around 50. It was heard that the number of Chinese people was about the same. It was the first time in recent months that the Japanese military police had been able to capture "rioters". According to reliable sources last night, the Japanese military police were ordered to conduct a search in the area because the Japanese side believed that a large number of "rioters" resided there. The Japanese military police may also be investigating the guerrillas who have been active near the Public Concession in recent months, but it is believed that if they are indeed irregular troops, they are all equipped with rifles.</p>

<p>The first prize of the eighth charity lottery for the relief of refugees issued by the French Concession, number 31607, was sold by the Dagong Enterprise Company store at the general sales office on Nanjing Road on March 11.

We now hope that the winner of the first prize will quickly go to the French head office (No. 1, Rue du Consulat) or the general sales company to redeem the full amount. There will be absolutely no donations or deductions, and the procedure is extremely simple. In addition, the ninth lottery was issued less than a week ago, and the number of tickets sold has reached one-third, so the sales of this lottery are expected to exceed the previous one.</p>

<p>Cao Xingbin and 77 other employees of the Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in this city recently jointly filed a complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing the factory owner, Xie Keming, the factory director, Xu Yanyu, and the manager, Zhu Gengtao, of embezzling 41,345.87 yuan in bonuses. Zhu Chuzhe, a judge, summoned them to the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. The defendants, Zhu Gengtao and others, did not appear. Chen Minkui, as a representative of the plaintiffs, arrived in court with a lawyer. He first stated that the wages of the plaintiffs who worked at the Renfeng Factory were extremely low, ranging from two to ten yuan, a mere sum that was obviously not enough to support a family. What they hoped for was the year-end bonus, which could be used to supplement their income. For example, in 1936, the factory had a surplus of 650,000 yuan, which the defendant side had clearly admitted. According to precedent, the bonus was distributed, but the amount of the bonus due to the plaintiffs was embezzled by the defendants jointly, amounting to a huge sum of 41,345.87 yuan. Therefore, they requested that the defendants be punished with the deserved crime, and ordered to return the full amount of the embezzled bonus. After reviewing the complaint, the court learned that the defendants had not arrived, so it announced that the hearing would be postponed to April 27, when the defendants would be summoned to court for further trial.</p>

<p>Zong Zhenmin, a Chinese police officer from the Foch Police Station (i.e., Baojian Road), No. 340, was 26 years old and from Zongming. He had been in this position for only one month, having been assigned to the 6:30 pm to 12:30 am shift on the night of the 12th, patrolling the section between No. 913 Foch Road and the intersection of Route Commandant Rebeaud. At 10:30 pm, a black sedan-style car with a white license plate (number unknown) drove from west to east on Foch Road and stopped in front of No. 1009 on the British Concession side. A man, about 20 years old, got out of the car and went to the French Concession side to look for the house number. Police Officer No. 340 Zong saw him and, suspecting his appearance, went forward to question him. Unexpectedly, the man reached out and punched Police Officer Zong in the face twice. At this time, two other men got out of the car. One of them asked what was going on and then fired a shot with a handgun, hitting Police Officer Zong in the buttocks. The officer fell to the ground, wounded. The three men who committed the crime ran to the car and sped away eastward. Although Police Officer Zong was wounded and fell to the ground, he was still conscious and blew his whistle. Police Officer No. 1117 arrived, learned what had happened, and reported it to the police station. An ambulance was called and Police Officer No. 340 Zong was sent to Guangci Hospital. After the doctor's incision and treatment proved ineffective, he died at 3 pm yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was taken to the autopsy room at No. 302 Rue Testelin to await inspection by a representative from the Second Special Court. The police station sent detectives to investigate various car dealerships and to track down the fugitive criminals for legal action.</p>

<p>The Chinese Women and Children Relief Association dispatches investigators to accompany detectives from the Water Patrol Police to board ships exporting to the North and South Seas, to search for abducted boys, girls, and women when the ships are exported from this city. This has been quite effective over the years. At 11 am on the 11th of this month, Chen Shaoting, an investigator from the association, found Yao Xiaoqin, a 19-year-old woman from Changshu, traveling to Tianjin alone in the third-class cabin of the Shengjing, a Tianjin-Mekong ship at Taikoo Wharf No. 3. Upon questioning, it was learned that she had been abducted and handed over to the ship's tea boy to be taken to Tianjin. The woman was detained, and the tea boy who handled the consignment was ordered to hand over Chen Peifang, a 20-year-old woman from Tongzhou (resident of No. 113, Shiyin Lane, Rue Kerloc'h), and was sent to the French Police Station. According to Chen Peifang, the woman, Yao, spent 260 yuan to buy her to a man named Bing Sheng, and was entrusted to someone to take her to Tianjin to work as a prostitute. Yesterday, the police station sent Chen Peifang to the Second Special Court for interrogation. A woman came to the court to listen. Yao pointed out that she was also involved in the abduction and sale, so the woman was turned over to the bailiff and taken to the police station to be detained for investigation. Chen Peifang was interrogated by Judge Miao Qingbang in the First Criminal Court at 3 pm. The lawyer from the French Concession Administration requested a postponement for investigation before filing a suit for interrogation. After the court questioned the defendant, it announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 22nd and the defendant would be detained.</p>

<p>Zhang Cailang, a 27-year-old man from Chongming, lived in a straw house with no number near Balidu Road, Xujiahui, in the French Concession. He used to work as a foreman, contracting small projects in various construction projects. Therefore, he had dozens of workers under him. In the past, if there was work, the food for all the workers was subcontracted to a caterer, calculated by name, and paid by him on their behalf, and then collected from the workers. Unexpectedly, in recent years, due to the impact of the war, work has plummeted. The workers, seeing that the foreman had lost his ability to operate, scattered and sought their own way. However, those who owed food money in the past had not settled their debts. Although Zhang Cailang had already paid some on their behalf, there was still a huge amount owed. They were all waiting for the workers to get work and gradually deduct it. Now that they have all scattered, the debt owed to the caterer will inevitably fall on Zhang Cailang alone. The caterer, due to a lack of capital turnover, demanded payment every day. Zhang, however, was ill-clad and had no ability to repay the debt. He could not cope with it, and a rift arose between them. Recently, the other party's demands have become more urgent. Zhang, in a state of poverty and desperation, suddenly had suicidal thoughts and swallowed poison pills last night. Fortunately, his family noticed and rushed him to the Dongsong Hospital for treatment. However, because the poisoning was too deep, his condition was critical.</p>

<p>Tao Gongchen's father, the head of the General Affairs Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration, went out from Wanshi Lane, Sanxing Lane, Connaught Road, at 5:45 pm on the 11th. Unexpectedly, as soon as he left the lane, he was hit by a speeding motorcycle and fell to the ground, suffering serious injuries. Street police officer No. 3251 arrived upon hearing the sound and sent him to the First Refugee Hospital on North Tibet Road for emergency treatment. However, due to his old age and weakness, the rescue was unsuccessful, and he died at 1 am yesterday. It is said that Tao's father was 76 years old and had always been in good health. Now that he has suffered such misfortune, those who heard about it all felt sorry for him. Gongchen, in view of the current national crisis, did not send out obituaries and scheduled the funeral.</p>

<p>Xie Zhiguang, the head of the Chinese detectives from the Route D'iesves Police Station, and Detective Zhao Lianbi, arrested six bandits Xu Yongquan (i.e., Yougen), Wang Yushan (i.e., Wen Haiquan, Xiao Shandong), Zhu Yunlong, Shen Yougen, Chen Haibin (i.e., Xiao Changdong), and Jiang Xianghong (i.e., Fuke) at No. 2, Lane 684, Yu Garden Road and Route Haig on February 19. Four pistols and Mauser guns, 32 bullets, and a lot of stolen goods were confiscated. After investigation, it was learned that these people, together with Li A'er (i.e., Garbage Can A'er), who is still at large, invaded the homes of Chinese Detective Yao Jiaqi and Chinese Deputy Detective Pan Ximan at No. 239 Da Xi Road on February 26, and robbed Liang Weiming's family at No. 7, Lane 156, Yidingpan Road, of property worth 3,582.7 yuan. On March 11, they invaded Zhang Zhirui's home at No. 29, Lane 189, Zha'na Road, West Shanghai, and took Zhang's three-year-old son Hanren, obtaining 7,000 yuan for his release. They were sent to the First Special Court.</p>
<p>The case was under detention and interrogation. At 2:30 pm yesterday, Xiao Peishen, the presiding judge, specially tried the case in the Second Criminal Court, and designated lawyer Qian Yuzhong as the pro bono defense attorney. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, first stated the facts of the Yao and Pan two detectives' home robbery case, saying that the defendant Wang Yushan was working as a bodyguard at Shao Lian'geng's gambling table at the Rongsheng Company on Rue Ratard in West Shanghai. The Mauser gun was decided to be used for robbery, but there was no purpose at first. While wandering on the way, at No. 339 Da Xi Road, they happened to see a maid pushing the door open, so the defendants rushed in. Yao, the police detective, lived downstairs, and Pan, the deputy police detective, lived upstairs. They were robbed of two pistols and clothes and money. They took the stolen goods and split them in room 308 of the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road under the name of Li Hongsheng. Li Yuan is now pawning a coat in Yunnan Zhonghengsheng. At Chen Guiting's French General Association, No. 47 Avenue Edward VII, they stole 100 yuan. Deputy Chinese Detective Pan Ximan reported that he was serving at the Hongqiao Police Station. On the evening of February 26, there was a thief who suddenly broke into my bedroom. I was robbed of a pistol and many other items, and pointed out that except for Zhu Yunlong, the rest of the defendants were watching. Chinese Detective Yao Jiaqi also testified. When questioned, the defendants all admitted it. Only Chen Haibin denied it. Then the lawyer stated that in the second case, except for the defendant Jiang Xianghong, the other defendants robbed Liang Weiming's family at No. 7, Lane 156, Yiding Road, of more than 3,000 yuan on February 17. Afterwards, they split the stolen goods in room 207 of the Xin Hotel on Jiujiang Road, and each got 200 yuan. When the defendants were arrested, a cigarette case engraved with Liang Weiming's English characters was found next to Xu Yongquan, and a gold cigarette case robbed from Liang's house was found next to Wang Yushan. Stolen goods were also pawned at Yunnan Road Hengmao Pawnshop, Avenue Edward VII Tongsheng Pawnshop, and Foch Road Tongchang Antique Shop. The Tongsheng Pawnshop took in a gold watch worth more than 300 yuan for more than 90 yuan, which is suspected of receiving stolen goods. The police station will file a separate lawsuit. Then the victim, Mrs. Liang Junying, and the witness, the maid Shen Abao, reported the case, proving the robbery and identifying the five defendants Xu, Wang, Zhu, Shen, and Chen as robbers at the scene. The stolen goods retrieved by the police station have also been confirmed to be correct. Xiao questioned the defendants based on the facts, and they all admitted the robbery. The lawyer then stated the second kidnapping case, saying that except for Jiang Xianghong, the rest of the defendants colluded with Li A'er, who is still at large, and invaded Zhang Zhirui's home at No. 39, Lane 189, Rue Knape on March 11, robbing him of 400-500 yuan in clothes and more than 300 yuan in cash. They were still not satisfied, so they opened the drawer and saw a savings passbook for 20,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications, so they demanded 10,000 yuan from Zhang. Because it was Saturday, the thieves also knew that even if they found the passbook, they would not be able to withdraw the money, so they asked for cash. At that time, a maid came in carrying Zhang's three-year-old son Hanren, and the thieves kidnapped Hanren as collateral. On Monday, the 13th, the thieves contacted Zhang by phone and agreed to negotiate the ransom in room 404 of the Continental Hotel on Rue Amiral Courbet. Zhang then withdrew money from the bank and drove to room 404 of the Continental Hotel. Suddenly, the thieves led Zhang to room 322 of the Far Eastern Hotel opposite. As a result, Zhang paid 7,000 yuan to redeem his son. At that time, Zhang, because many things were robbed, asked the thieves to return the pawn tickets, and the thieves also agreed. Zhang did not report to the police station afterwards. When the defendants were arrested, they confessed to this case, saying that all the phone calls were made from the Far Eastern. Police detectives also investigated this point, and there was a phone call from room 322 of the Far Eastern to No. 20537 on Taiyang Island, which is Zhang's phone number. The telephone bill was presented as evidence. Zhang Zhirui reported the case, stating the details, which was the same as what the lawyer said, but Zhang pointed out that the five defendants Xu and others were all present at the time to kidnap, rob, and negotiate. The defendant Chen Haibin still gave evasive testimony when questioned, and the rest admitted it. After the police station's lawyer and the lawyer Qian Yuzhong, who was designated to defend the defendants, debated, the court concluded the trial and awaited sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody. The police station has learned that the defendants also committed robberies at Li Juren's home at No. 13, Yangzi Village, Yidingpan Road, for 3,000 yuan, Zhou Bogui's home at No. 16 of the same lane, for 700 yuan, and Cao Zanyan's home at No. 24, Caojia Zhai, for 1,000 yuan. Because the location belongs to the road built beyond the border, the police station did not prosecute.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Talking About Milk (Part 1) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Jimin</p>
<p>It seems that it has become a trend in society now, no matter who wants to take supplements, they always say that they want to have some milk, chicken essence, and beef essence every day. People with poor nutrition, when they go to the doctor, are always advised to eat some milk, chicken essence, and beef essence. Western doctors certainly say this, and Chinese doctors have recently become no exception. In particular, milk has occupied a very important position in dietary supplements.</p>
<p>The nutritional value of milk is very clearly recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica in traditional Chinese medicine. The current excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Milk (Taste) sweet, slightly cold, non-toxic (Indications) tonifies deficiency and emaciation, quenches thirst. (Other Records) nourishes the heart and lungs, relieves heat and toxins, moisturizes the skin. (Ri Hua) Cold tonic, lowers heat, cook with garlic and boil for food, removes cold rheumatism. (Zang Qi) People with hot wind should eat it. (Meng Xian) It is beneficial for the elderly to cook it, and adding ginger and green onions stops children from vomiting milk and tonifies consumption. (Si Miao) Treats vomiting and hiccups due to heat, tonifies labor and damage, moistens the large intestine, treats dysentery due to qi, removes jaundice, and is very suitable for the elderly to cook porridge. (Shi Zhen)</p>
<p>The nutritional components published by Western doctors are as follows:</p>
<p>Milk Moisture 87.2, Protein 3.5, Fat 3.7, Carbohydrates 4.9, Ash 0.7, Vitamins A, B, and C are all present.</p>
<p>Looking at the above interpretations of Chinese and Western doctors, milk is indeed a good thing, so no wonder Chinese and Western doctors both recommend it to patients. However, according to my experience, some patients do see very effective results after eating it, but some patients remain the same, and even a small number of patients vomit after eating it for the first time (mostly old ladies), some have bad breath after eating it, and some have diarrhea. Many patients have said to me: Milk is too hot in nature. Is milk hot in nature after all? This is a question that most people want to ask, so I don’t mind writing some of it below:</p>
<h3 id="e118">Hunger and Fullness <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jingqing</p>
<p>Eating enough leads to fullness; eating not enough leads to hunger. This is known by everyone. But what does it mean to be hungry while full, and full while hungry? Humans eat to nourish themselves. The poor say they eat because they are forced to by hunger, while the rich say they eat for the enjoyment of good food. However, from a medical point of view, the purpose of eating is to replenish the nutrients that the human body needs for life, and there is no distinction between rich and poor in this. But if the digestive function is not healthy and cannot secrete essence to nourish the blood, then even if one eats a lot of delicious food, it will still not benefit the body's nutrition. At the same time, waste cannot be excreted from the body. Food may stagnate in the stomach and intestines, causing abdominal distension and constipation, and turbid qi to rise. The human body will not benefit but will be harmed. On the other hand, even if one eats less, if digestion is normal, the essence will be enough to replenish the body's nutritional needs, and waste can be excreted from the body in time. In this case, the purpose of eating is achieved. This is more beneficial than eating a lot of delicacies but having poor digestion, which is beneficial. This is what I mean by being hungry while full and full while hungry. In the former case, although one eats a lot, one lacks nutrition, hence the term "full but hungry." In the latter case, although one eats less, one has sufficient nutrition, hence the term "hungry but full."</p>
<p>The feeling of hunger and fullness is also a natural ability that helps us maintain normal digestion. The reason why we feel hunger is because the stomach is empty, and the reason why we feel fullness is because the stomach is full (exceptions due to illness are a different matter). Therefore, we should eat when we are hungry and not eat when we are full, so that the digestive function of the stomach can always be maintained normally. The only people who starve are those who are forced to by economic constraints. I have never heard of a gourmet who, seeing a delicious meal, has his appetite aroused, but forcibly restrains himself because he is worried that he cannot digest it. Therefore, diseases caused by overeating are common. Shouldn't those who pay attention to dietary hygiene always follow the guidance of this natural ability to protect their health?</p>
<p>There is a saying, "If you want a child to be safe, always keep him three parts hungry and cold." In fact, adults should also "rather be slightly hungry than overeat," so that they are hungry but full, and avoid the situation of being full but actually hungry.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Shellfish Foods <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jianchu</p>
<p>Shellfish foods, in the minds of Chinese people, have always been regarded as dishes to accompany meals and drinks, and considered to have no nutritional value. This is a mistake. Although shellfish foods are cheaper than fish and meat, a careful examination of their nutritional composition reveals that they are actually more nutritious. In European, American, and Japanese countries, they are highly valued. Their juices are often extracted and made into medicines specifically for treating pulmonary tuberculosis and developmental deficiencies. In various parts of Guangdong in our country, they are also used to treat tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The shellfish we commonly see include shrimp, crabs, clams, snails, oysters, etc. The nutritional value of the first four is relatively lower, while oysters are the best.</p>
<p>Oysters are also known as oyster yellow. The Cantonese call them "hao," and their oil is called "oyster sauce." Oysters have a salty taste and a slightly cold nature. Eating the meat inside the shell can replenish deficiency, stop sweating, treat malaria, and eliminate fright, and nourish the body and dispel heat. They can also treat blood leakage and seminal emission. Their most notable effect is that they are good at treating phlegm accumulation and chronic coughs and asthma in the elderly. They can also nourish the lungs, so they are suitable foods for those who are weak after illness.</p>
<p>One point to note: the meat of this food is not easily digested. Therefore, those with poor digestion should not eat too much. When cooking, it should be simmered over low heat for a long time to be beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Dizziness <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Demin</p>
<p>Dizziness is a liver disease. It refers to a condition where the head and eyes are dizzy and unsteady, the body is out of control, and one feels that the house is spinning and the ground is moving, leading to falls and fainting. Mild cases resolve on their own in a short time, while severe cases may take several days to recover. There are many causes of the disease, but the most common is blood deficiency and rising liver fire. It is more common in women than in men, and more common in the elderly than in young people. It is most common in spring. Even those with a history of dizziness are prone to relapse during this time of rising yang energy.</p>
<p>When the disease occurs, it is advisable to take medicine to regulate it. If the method is appropriate, one or two doses can cure it. If you want to cure it thoroughly, you must pay attention to self-care, broaden your mind, be happy, and choose what you like to do. Spicy and stimulating foods are strictly prohibited. In addition to taking medicine, you can use mulberry leaves (stir-fried until withered) and black sesame seeds (stir-fried until cooked), grind them into powder, add sugar, and eat them as a snack when half-hungry. They taste very fragrant and delicious, and have the functions of dispelling wind, cooling blood, soothing the liver, and benefiting the kidneys. According to experience, it has a special effect on dizziness caused by blood deficiency and liver hyperactivity. This is to incorporate medicinal food into daily diet. Regular consumption will surely have great effect. The prescription of Fushang Pill in ancient times is also the same. (Chrysanthemum tea is also slightly effective, eat walnuts often, do not worry too much, and do not live in a house with too low a roof.)</p>
<h3 id="e121">Roasted Sweet Potato <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jinqiu</p>
<p>If a pair of thoroughly modern young men and women were holding roasted sweet potatoes and eating them in their seats in a high-class cinema, then it can be predicted that they would definitely attract the attention of those sitting next to them. If a few roasted sweet potatoes were placed on a banquet table for guests, then it can be predicted that the host would definitely be criticized for being stingy. However, that would be wrong! Roasted sweet potatoes are both fragrant and sweet; they are palatable and filling; the four words "cheap and good" can be applied to them without shame. It is not a silly girl who cannot be dressed up. As long as you peel off its rough outer clothes, its delicate and white skin will touch people's eyes and immediately arouse infinite pleasure. Westernized, spread some butter on it, or rustic, add some cooked lard, and while it is still hot, send it to your mouth bite by bite. Even if you are not hungry, your mouth will water. Moreover, it also contains sufficient nutritional value and medicinal effects. However, if there were a great doctor who prescribed a few sweet potatoes as a medicinal primer on a formal prescription, it can be predicted that this doctor would inevitably be ridiculed as being improper. Why is it subjected to such embarrassing discrimination? Probably the first reason is that it is sold too cheaply, and the second is that its appearance is too ugly. In fact, its effect is really not small! "Diagnosis Collection" says, "There is a case of long-term spleen diarrhea, which was ineffective after taking medicine. Later, a doctor passed on a prescription: Take a sweet potato, half a catty, mix it with yellow mud, wrap it up, put it in the stove and bake it until cooked, remove the mud and skin and eat it. Do this with each one, and after eating for three or four months, the spleen qi will be healthy, and the stool will also be firm." (Omitted below) This shows its effect.</p>
<p>Tofu and green vegetables are the most hygienic. (Recorded words of President Sun)</p>

<p>— Fan Jingfu</p>
<p>Buy a small amount of maltose (i.e., malt extract, commonly known as pure sugar) from an old goods stall, stew it with tofu, and feed it to children suffering from coughs in spring. It is very effective, but at the same time, it is necessary to avoid eating foods such as fish and shrimp that can aggravate the condition, so that it is easy to achieve results.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Good Medicine for Venereal Disease <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jieren</p>
<p>Syphilis is a malignant venereal disease. Patients often seek help from 606, but Smilax glabra (i.e., mountain turtle) in Chinese medicine is also an important product for expelling syphilis. Smilax glabra is a blood-changing medicine for deterioration. It has the effects of clearing blood and detoxifying. It can treat ulcers, sores, and syphilis that have not healed for a long time. However, it is effective only when eaten in large quantities. If it is eaten in the early stage, it is more effective than arsenic, iodine, bismuth, mercury, and other agents for all stages of syphilis.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Sweet Potato Stops Seasickness <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Lixiu</p>
<p>Sweet potato, also known as sweet potato, and also known as yam. It is sweet and warm in nature. Frying and eating it replenishes the spleen and stomach, benefits qi and strength, resists wind and cold, and improves complexion. The scales vary. Those with red skin, no tendons, and a pure sweet taste are good. It can also be eaten raw. Those who are seasick when crossing the sea, whether raw or cooked, will be at ease after eating a small amount.</p>

<p>— Lu Hengqing</p>
<p>Women's physiques are generally not as strong as men's, and their physiological organization is also more complex. Therefore, most of them are thin and sick. Moreover, women's psychology is particularly sensitive to shame. If they encounter leukorrhea that is continuous and unclean, they often endure it in silence and avoid mentioning it to doctors, resulting in improper medication and self-delay, which is a great regret. For dietary treatment, every morning after washing, take seven ginkgo biloba seeds with the hearts removed and three walnut kernels, put them in your mouth and chew them carefully, then swallow them with boiled water. If you do not stop, it will surely have miraculous effects over time.</p>

<p>Those who suffer from athlete's foot can take equal amounts of bran and flour, add some lard (about two tablespoons of oil in a rice bowl), white sugar or salt, and a few eggs (two eggs in a rice bowl) and a little cold boiled water, stir them together into a paste, put them in an iron pot and bake them into thin cakes, and use them as breakfast or afternoon snacks on a daily basis. It will be effective over time.</p>

<p>— Ni Xian</p>
<p>(IV) Winter Melon Tea (Preparation) Take one tael of high-quality Fujian rock sugar and one and a half taels of raw watermelon seeds (do not remove the shells, as half of the efficacy is in the shells). Boil with water until the sugar dissolves and the seeds are cooked. Take the soup and drink it frequently. (It is even better if it can be stewed in a large rice pot.) The sweetness can be adjusted with water. (Effect) This tea is sweet and refreshing, and although it seems plain, it has a great effect. It can be taken daily for dry coughs with blood and prolonged illnesses. It can moisten the lungs, relieve coughs, stop bleeding, and reduce fever. It has been repeatedly tested.</p>
<p>(V) Laver Soup (Preparation) Purchase some plump laver from a South Goods Store, pick out impurities such as sand, hard roots, small fish, and shellfish, then rinse it with boiling water. It can be stewed on the rice pot or steamed in water. Since laver is a type of seaweed, it is originally salty, so there is no need to add other seasonings. (Effect) It is good for treating pulmonary tuberculosis. Even if it is half rotten, it can be restored. Laver has the functions of dissolving hardness, unblocking collaterals, removing turbidity, and eliminating phlegm. It is better than Bletilla striata. Someone suffered from severe pulmonary paralysis, spitting out foul phlegm, and all medicines were ineffective. Later, he moved to the seaside and ate laver every day, and he recovered.</p>
<p>(VI) Lard Dates (Preparation) Take plate lard, peel off the skin, cut it into small cubes, pickle it with white sugar, then take good-quality jujubes, use a small knife to dig out the pits, put a piece of lard in each date, put them in a bowl, seal the top with cotton paper, pierce small holes like lotus seed pods, steam them on the rice pot two or three times, open the seal and look at them. The dates are plump, the skin is flat, and the oil is melting and dripping, like crystal color. Then they can be taken. (Effect) They taste sweet, fragrant, and fatty. They are specifically for replenishing the spleen and stomach, filling the middle qi, increasing appetite, and moisturizing the skin. People with stomach diseases who are hungry after eating should eat two or three each time, which is very beneficial.</p>
<p>(VII) Kanli Decoction (Preparation) Peel five or seven longan pulp (commonly known as dried longan), and one mace of American ginseng (it must be more than seven hundred branches, whole or sliced). Decoction with plenty of water and take it on an empty stomach or before going to bed. (Effect) These two things can nourish the heart and help the true fire, and can clear heat and lengthen the body fluid. All symptoms such as yin deficiency, hyperactivity of fire, thirst, palpitations, insomnia, irritability, dry mouth, and constipation can be gradually relieved.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Guerrilla Warfare in Shanxi <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>This season, we can often see the excitement of guerrilla warfare in Shanxi in the newspapers, because telegrams about it are often issued from Chongqing, Yuanqu, Xingji, and even Beijing. However, these telegrams are always short and only state the general situation, making it impossible for us to see the full picture. Therefore, it can be said that there are some shortcomings.</p>
<p>Now, there is a detailed special telegram sent by a Reuters correspondent from a certain place in Shanxi. This really gave us great joy and great comfort! We are delighted to learn of this news, and comforted that the guerrilla warfare in that area has been so successful!</p>
<p>So far, we have seen several such telegrams. In summary, there are the following key points that deserve our attention:</p>
<p>(1) The cities occupied by the Japanese army are useless. Not only can they not be used as bases to wreak havoc, but they have become urns for catching turtles, making them helpless. They have suffered several losses, so they dare not attack them again. Guerrilla warfare has indeed had a great effect. I think if all parts of the country can do this, how difficult will it be to eliminate the enemy!</p>
<p>(2) The military supplies made by our army have such wonderful uses and are so sufficient that even if the international route is really cut off in the future and external assistance cannot arrive, there is nothing to worry about. It can be seen that the heavens never cut off all avenues. Everything depends on human effort. As long as there is a need and you are willing to work hard to find a way, it can always be solved.</p>
<p>(3) The people in all those places have been fully mobilized and have become one with other anti-Japanese warriors. This is also something that other places cannot match. We have long known that this war of resistance is a national war of resistance, but the implementation in other places is always somewhat lacking, not as complete and thorough as in these places. We should learn from this.</p>
<p>(4) The Japanese are of course doing everything they can to sabotage, and the correspondent believes that the worrying thing is the disruption of Japanese currency and goods, which may cause difficulties. I hope that the authorities in that area will be able to pay close attention, on the one hand, to prevent them from using their skills, and on the other hand, to meet the legitimate needs of the people.</p>
<p>Most of these points give us comfort. In the last point, I think that under the wise authorities, difficulties will always be easily overcome.</p>
<p>In this second phase of the War of Resistance, guerrilla warfare is still the main position, so I specially brought up the guerrilla warfare in Shanxi to ask our compatriots across the country to pay attention; at the same time, I also hope that our journalists will have such detailed telegrams sent to us, further increasing our joy and comfort.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Mother and Son <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Tianshe</p>
<p>Just after putting down the rice bowl, the mother and son of the Pockmarked Ma family are arguing again in the small house.</p>
<p>"Damn it, really damn it!" Uncle Shupao knocked on his early tobacco pipe, stretched out his twig-like hand, wiped off the rice soup stained on his whiskers, and said with a wrinkled mouth: "In this situation, what are they still arguing about? They can't even get food in their mouths, but they have the leisure to argue. Alas, alas!" He was sighing while taking out his already empty pipe.</p>
<p>Aunt Shupao was tearing broken socks under the eaves, pulling out the sock yarn and making it into a ball. Seeing Uncle Shupao sitting on the threshold sighing, she turned her face and glanced at him: "Old thing, mind your own business. Take care of yourself. You won't die if you smoke a few less pipes. Didn't Wang Er, who carries groceries on a pole, say that when he went to the city to buy some goods, he suffered all the anger of those Japanese soldiers, almost had his felt hat taken off, and was beaten until blood was foaming from his teeth, and he was hit with two gun butts in the kidneys. He swore not to go to the city anymore, sold off his stock, and would rather starve to death at home, so that even if you have money, you can't buy tobacco." She said viciously.</p>
<p>"See what day these evil ghosts will make it to..." Uncle Shupao interrupted, disappointed.</p>
<p>But the mother and son of the Pockmarked Ma family in the small house were arguing even more fiercely. Curses, wails, and the sound of breaking bowls came one after another. Aunt Shupao, who had just told Shupao not to mind other people's business, dropped the broken socks and yarn ball and ran to the small house first. She muttered in her mouth: "Alas, arguing, arguing, even if they argue to the sky, they are still mother and son... What benefit can come out of arguing..."</p>
<p>Just as Aunt Shupao was about to step over the threshold of the small house, the son of the Pockmarked Ma family desperately rushed out of the house, followed by the wife of the Pockmarked Ma, her face pale with anger, panting, holding a door bolt in her hand, obviously intending to chase and beat her son. Aunt Shupao was quick-witted and quick-handed, grabbed her and said: "What's wrong? Why are you so angry? Calm down. Mother and son, what's the big deal? You can always discuss it. After your Pockmarked Ma died, he left you with this precious seed, and there are no other sons or daughters there."</p>
<p>"Aunt, let me go, uh. Today I must beat him half to death. This unfilial son, does he still have me as his mother in his eyes!" The wife of the Pockmarked Ma could not get rid of her anger for a while.</p>
<p>Aunt Shupao finally persuaded and dragged her to her own door, and gave her a stool to sit on. "Hehe, Ma's family, everything can only be done carelessly these days." Uncle Shupao stroked his whiskers and stood up from the threshold, saying this.</p>
<p>"To be honest, Uncle and Aunt, I am willing to obey him in everything else, but I will not agree to this!" The wife of the Pockmarked Ma gritted her teeth, looking very determined. Aunt Shupao asked first: "What exactly is going on?" The wife of the Pockmarked Ma 'hummed' and then said a long string:</p>
<p>"What's going on! He is going to work for the Japanese soldiers as a coolie, building roads! Tell me if he has any conscience. Pockmarked Ma was shot to death by a Japanese soldier next to the road, for no reason, died so pitifully: lying on the ditch, his head was smashed to pieces, the blood flowing into the ditch, the brains flowing into the ditch. At that time, the Japanese soldiers had just arrived, and no one dared to collect the body during the day. Uncle and Aunt all know that it was Jiangbei people from the ancestral hall who stole it back in the night: this unfilial son, hasn't he seen it? Now he doesn't want to avenge his father, but he wants to work for the Japanese soldiers. Hmph, making money! I don't care about a thousand taels of silver, I would rather starve to death, but I can't let him earn blood money... I want him to see his father: the body of the Pockmarked Ma..." When she said this, her voice trembled so much that she couldn't continue, and she cried loudly on purpose.</p>
<p>Uncle Shupao also felt indignant after hearing this, and knocked his early tobacco pipe on the stone slab, intending to find the son of the Pockmarked Ma in the village to admonish him. "No one in our village is allowed to be a traitor!" He muttered to himself.</p>

<p>Life is like a drama, it always has an end.</p>
<p>Countless people are born in silence, and they will die in silence!</p>
<p>Life and death are like one. With life, there is destruction. Life is like a budding flower, praised by people. Death, however, is a terrible thing hidden in the darkness, and the living do not need this rest!</p>
<p>But death also has a brilliant light, praised and sung by people, it has an amazing brilliance.</p>
<p>This is the most magnificent historical drama, created for liberation and freedom.</p>
<p>This death drives away ghosts and monsters from the living world, and builds justice for the living human beings.</p>
<p>The honored death is singing: "This is not that ordinary death, this is life, without darkness; these thousands of deaths create the light of this world!"</p>
<p>Death appeared in the flames, and that majestic shout awakened all people!</p>
<p>Death appeared in the pool of blood, with a beautiful smile, scaring away the enemies of all mankind!</p>
<p>Death, brave death, great death!</p>
<p>Let us not weep for the dead, or pity them, let alone be silent and pray for them!</p>
<p>Sing for the dead, cheer for the dead, this willingness to die will never be erased.</p>
<p>This death is not lonely!</p>

<p>— Diàn Cháng (Pen name)</p>
<p>Warrior, Talented Scholar, Cat, Old Man Episode.</p>
<p>It is now spring. Yes, it brings warmth, comfort, vigor, and the vitality of life. We rejoice in spring, which often brings warmth, vigor, and the vitality of life. Spring may have its seductive qualities, but it must never cause brave and rational warriors to be depressed, annoyed, or restless. Although they in the frozen, cloudy land become more active in the spring, continuing the more fierce struggle, Shelley said: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Yes, this is the spring.</p>
<p>"In the third month of late spring, the grasses of Jiangnan grow long; various flowers bloom on trees, and orioles fly in confusion." This is originally a phenomenon of spring, but it has not yet grasped the rich meaning of spring. We love Jiangnan, and we also love Jiangbei; we love long grass, and we love various flowers; we also love the White Mountains, and we love the Black Water; we even love ice and snow, and we love wind and rain, and we love sleet and hail, and we love thunder and lightning. The land of the motherland is warm everywhere, with its fragrance, even if it is not in spring. In the spring, we express even greater love, and all that we have is always greater strength, and we are always promoting the power of strong combat.</p>
<p>In the feeling of some talented scholars, spring will become lazy and entangled: "What can be done with such a beautiful day and scenery? Whose courtyard is full of delightful events?" Isn't this the trouble of young girls in spring? "A ten-thousand-gold sword is hidden in autumn waters, and a full horse of spring sorrows presses on the embroidered saddle." That was originally the sexual melancholy of a heroic spring, prone to melancholy and illness. There are not a few romantic talented scholars under the heavens, "The flowing water and falling flowers are gone with spring, in heaven and on earth." This is precisely the sound of heartbreak before decline, "Leave the soul there, and the remaining body begs for ashes; the green phosphorescent fire does not diminish, and illuminates the Yan Terrace every night!" "Young heads," those who lose their integrity in the spring cannot help but vent secretly, although they still have such a veiled appearance.</p>
<p>Let us sing the greatness of the power of spring, even if some people dare not face it squarely.</p>
<p>This year's spring's arrival brings with it solemnity and coldness, but we use even more tragic and joyful hearts to caress it, and then let it fly past leisurely: next year's spring will come again!</p>
<p>That's right, it will come, next year's spring. But even if it is spring, flowers will not grow on cold white bones. The sad emotions of the Bushido talented scholars are triggered, and they are angry, resentful, distressed, and worried: "The person in the spring boudoir dream," then sighs a wisp of faint long breath. Apart from the venting of barbaric bestiality, it is just a heart full of emptiness: "Waiting is having a home but not being able to return, ah, ah, ah!"</p>
<p>So the joke of spring comes; the cat is calling spring on the eaves, and the Bushido talented scholars under the eaves, hearing it, immediately hysterically go crazy: finally, a general attack is launched, and a small team makes a general encirclement: bang, bang, bang! The call of spring stops abruptly, and the cat falls down. But it is even more lonely, and the talented scholars are even more desolate: "A symbol of melancholy!" Furrowing their brows and gnashing their teeth, they feel the same as the cat, in the spring.</p>
<p>However, there is no spring in their country: "The authorities of that country yesterday entertained film industry experts, explaining the government's newly passed laws, prohibiting young people throughout the country from watching love films; at the same time, the inspection authorities believe that films depicting the lucky games have a bad influence, and are also prohibited (according to a Haitong telegram on April 6)." Good heavens, they first strangled the cat's heart like this. They themselves have aged early: refusing to admit that this is spring—but even if they want to "return to youth," it is also "impossible to turn the tide": to prevent this spring, they first implemented the work of castration. (As for the insane enjoyment of the military-industrial capitalists, as usual, they turn a blind eye; this is two hundred million new taxes at work.)</p>
<p>They don't give you recognition, shout, "Young talented scholars swallow their anger" (the Bushido "wailing to the heavens" spirit has long lost its tradition.), but this reflection increasingly shows its unstable foundation.</p>
<p>At the end of the generous Aixinjueluo dynasty, although it also reached the period of its final splendor, the skill of "receiving the mandate of heaven" was done quite beautifully. Yu Yue, responding to the examination of "faint smoke, sparse rain, falling flowers day," had the line "flowers fall but spring remains," which greatly pleased the officials. (See Spring Dwelling Hall Notes.) That catered to the ruler's psychology of "concealing" the inevitable decline of the world. "Spring often stays here, ah!" Ah, now, they have not been heard to ah again. Merely "concealing twice, to comfort loneliness," the Aixinjueluo ruling class itself's "emptiness" is already clear. However, that dynasty's not shying away from the phenomenon of decline of "falling flowers day" undoubtedly still had great courage. They admitted spring.</p>
<p>In the period of decline, still castrating spring, a certain ××'s collapse is imminent!! Whether you admit spring or not, it's up to you.</p>
<p>A certain warrior filled in a "Divination Song" in suffering, although it also had some talented scholar meaning, it quite showed his fighting spirit. The latter half of the poem is: "Flowers fall, knowing spring is gone, let the wind and rain be; believing that spring will come again next year, there should be fragrance as before."</p>
<p>Even if this year's spring is serious and cold, we greet it with tragic and joyful hearts; the arrival of next year's spring will be warmer, and we will be even more joyful.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Idle Talk on the Clothing of Several Important People <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>

<p>Each set of clothing of Chairman Chiang does not exceed one hundred yuan in price.</p>
<p>Madam Wellington Koo's collection of clothes is most scientifically done.</p>
<p>Our highest leader often cautions his subordinates, saying: Clothing is not about being luxurious, but it must absolutely be kept neat and clean. As for our Chairman Chiang, how he dresses, the general public probably very much want to know, right? To say that his clothes are truly a model for the people of the country, he is not like a certain general, deliberately pretentious, but appropriately expresses the demeanor of a leader. Ordinary casual clothes never exceed the price of one hundred yuan per set, emphasizing simplicity, durability, and domestic products. The color he likes is tan. Only that special-grade general's uniform was made at a higher cost. However, he wears it very few times and stores it very well. His clothes have long been made by a tailor at Hua Pai Lou. When the political center moved to Hankou last time, that tailor also moved to Jianghan Road, so the Chairman's clothes have always been made by them. That general's uniform used to be dry-cleaned by "Verdun," but now with environmental obstacles, I am afraid that his old man's cleaning of this suit will be a little troublesome, because Chongqing and other places do not have such high-end facilities. Madam Wellington Koo, Huang Huilan, has lived in Europe and America for a long time and is deeply influenced by Westernization. She is also particularly particular about clothing, especially its collection, which is done entirely according to scientific procedures. Each season when she changes her clothes, they must be dry-cleaned one by one. According to her introduction to Zhang Xueliang's wife, Yu Fengzhi: Based on her experience, among all the laundry shops in Shanghai (it can also be said in all of China), only the Verdun Dry Cleaning shop on Xavia Road near Hua Long Road suits her heart best. Later, when Ms. Yu traveled to various countries and returned to Shanghai, she also told her close friends, praising Ms. Huang's rich experience and strict selection, truly Verdun's work can be compared with those of Britain, France, and the United States. (Note: Verdun's telephone number is 83388)</p>

<h3 id="e138">Relief for Educated Youth <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Yù Quán (Pen name)</p>
<p>On the second of this month, it was reported that an elementary school teacher, driven by life, became mentally deranged and had no choice but to commit theft twice. On the 11th, it was reported again that more than 200 female students who had graduated from a certain university in Nanjing and young people with secondary and higher education levels were reduced to beggars due to difficult living conditions. Reading these two news items, we are truly very heartbroken. They are all educated young people with advanced knowledge. Because life on the isolated island is not easy, they cannot establish themselves in society. It is truly necessary to arouse social attention and, more urgently, to provide them with relief.</p>
<p>Currently, the International Relief Committee is conducting a detailed investigation into the reasons why they have become beggars, so that the committee can provide them with edification and education. This method is naturally very good, but I think they should be sent to the interior, or do some practical work on the isolated island. In this way, their lives can be resolved, and they can also do some work for the country's war effort. Otherwise, even if they are rescued, their profound knowledge will still be buried.</p>
<p>It is very obvious why they have been reduced to beggars. Who bestowed this upon them? They themselves also understand very well that this is entirely due to the oppression of the invaders. I can be sure that each of them has a heart full of fervent anger. They have not failed to think of revenge, but in the end, it is always because of the weakness of manpower, a lone hand clapping makes no sound, and they cannot find a suitable opportunity, which leads them to fall to this point. They will definitely not be willing to rely on others for relief for a long time; they must seek their own greatest way out.</p>
<p>Now, the International Relief Committee is working hard for the livelihood of these unemployed people. We hope that the committee will organize national salvation groups for them, so that they can work separately at all levels, or teach them production skills, or help them to go to the interior. In this way, satisfactory results can be obtained, and it is also the only way for fundamental relief.</p>
<p>At the same time, we hope that these many unemployed educated young people can bury themselves in hard work in such a difficult environment, not burying their own knowledge and abilities, and earnestly start national salvation work!</p>
<h3 id="e139">On "Native Place Associations" <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Fán Jǐ (Pen name)</p>
<p>If we could analyze the various organizations in Shanghai in detail, then we would be able to discover that their nature and purpose are all different and have differences. For example, some are organizations with a religious color, such as the YMCA, the YWCA, and the like; some are of a nature that promotes proper entertainment, such as the Hua Lian Amusement Association, the Yi You Society, etc.; still others, such as the Jingwu Athletic Association, etc., are dedicated to physical training. In addition, in banks, foreign firms, and various businesses, taking advantage of spare time, dozens of like-minded comrades gather together for the purpose of studying academics and entertaining, and such organizations are too numerous to count. Indeed, every citizen living in Shanghai can be said to have the opportunity to join some organization or club in order to obtain a happy group life.</p>
<p>Speaking of organizations in Shanghai, we can probably all easily think of an organization called the "Native Place Association," right? The purpose of establishing a "Native Place Association" is the same as that of other organizations, which is to increase people's welfare and improve their lives. However, in general terms, because they are limited to "native place" reasons, their field is much smaller than other organizations.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Shanghai was still a desolate white land, and of course, there was no such thing as a "Native Place Association." It was not until later that Shanghai was opened as a port for trade, so trade flourished, business prospered, and Shanghai slowly embarked on the road to prosperity. At the same time, the number of business people who came to Shanghai from other places to make a living also gradually increased from a small number. Speaking of which, among the current four or five million people in Shanghai, very few can truly be called "Shanghainese." Most of them can be said to have moved to Shanghai from other places at that time to do business and work, and thus lived there for a long time. This group of people from all over the world, because of the differences in their respective dialects and customs, of course, when they meet "fellow villagers," they will always appear particularly affectionate and friendly. Therefore, over time, in order to seek the welfare and convenience of each "fellow villager," they gathered together and organized various "Native Place Associations" in order to use collective strength to do some beneficial things for individuals in a foreign land and fulfill some responsibilities of mutual assistance and relief.</p>
<p>The above can be said to be a general account of the origin of "Native Place Associations" in Shanghai. At present, their influence has indeed expanded to a very large and wide area. Their every move not only affects "fellow villagers," but is also enough to affect "strangers." Among them, the Ningbo Native Place Association, the Pudong Native Place Association, and several others are the most famous. Nowadays, almost everyone living in Shanghai knows the business they do.</p>
<p>I have already said that the purpose of organizing "Native Place Associations" is to promote various welfare undertakings that are beneficial to "fellow villagers." Therefore, things like providing medical treatment and medicine, establishing guild halls, establishing schools, and all other charitable undertakings, various native place associations are almost all trying their best to carry out. After the prelude to the "August 13th" war was unveiled the year before, the work done by the "Native Place Associations" became even more intense. They exhausted all kinds of methods, driving trucks to the war zones in the line of fire to rescue "fellow villagers" from danger, and, moreover, changed the guild halls located in the concessions into "refugee shelters" for the temporary accommodation of general "fellow villagers"... Anyone who sees this kind of great spirit of service will probably feel gratified and admired.</p>
<p>We all know that the power of "fellow villagers" uniting together can be said to be the easiest and most solid in the relationship between people. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen also said that we should make good use of and maximize the organization of "Native Place Associations" to strengthen the power of the group and expand the scope of the gathering (the general idea is like this). So, now that China is growing up in a difficult and arduous situation, the power of this "Native Place Association" is even more precious and should be used, without a doubt. Indeed, why should we limit ourselves to the name of "fellow villagers"? We must strengthen and expand this kind of organization, from fellow villagers, to fellow provincials, to fellow countrymen, and make every Chinese person a solid link in the process of the War of Resistance, with one heart and one mind, and everyone embracing the determination to live together and die together. Then, the arrival of the final victory, I can guarantee, will definitely be a matter of the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>— Sī Jìng (Pen name)</p>
<p>Since Ye Qianyu's Mr. Wang became popular, it seems that Tianyi Film Company was the first to bring the characters from this comic onto the screen. After that, Tang Jie, who played Mr. Wang, also seemed to have produced several Mr. Wang movies himself. However, in the past, because they were too focused on "slapstick," the audience's impression of the Mr. Wang movies seemed not as profound as the comics. This is a very obvious example: shoddy work is bound to fail, although it can deceive the audience for a time. Since the War of Resistance, Mr. Wang Tang Jie has also set off with the National Salvation Drama Troupe to the interior. When he returned to Shanghai, in a difficult journey of more than a year, he must have seen more and more valuable things. This first Mr. Wang movie after the war, "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat," we cannot deny that it has some progress compared to previous works.</p>
<p>First of all, he noticed the most realistic theme of a depressed society where it is "hard to eat" everywhere. Moreover, from the theme of Mr. Wang finding it hard to eat, he reflected the various aspects of hardship, treachery, and the coldness of human relationships. For example, when Mr. Wang was doing small business, he finally changed industries because of a local ruffian's extortion of "tribute." When Mr. Wang took office, because the name "Wang Sheng" and his "getup" were not in the eyes of the messenger, he enjoyed being turned away. But when Mr. Wang explained that he was the secretary, the messenger respectfully offered cigarettes and tea, being condescending first and respectful later. Also, the messenger was afraid of not serving him well, and the innkeeper knelt down to beg for forgiveness. "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat" has done its best to satirize. Here is the most adorable scene, which is Mr. Wang chasing after banknotes, which symbolizes the ugly state of humans chasing after banknotes.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat" also mentioned family problems and women's problems. For example, because Mr. Wang was unemployed, his wife took his daughter away. In the end, Mr. Wang remarried, and when his daughter knew that her husband was her father, she said, "Father has ruined me!" But "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat" also has its shortcomings. For example, the above two problems are only used as dramatic insertions. After Mr. Wang was rescued after throwing himself into the river, he said, "Death is cowardly, I want to fight!" The movie did not tell us how to fight, but Mr. Wang accidentally became a secretary, which inevitably makes people have a fluke mentality.</p>
<p>Regarding the past Mr. Wang movies, I have seen very few. Whether Tang Jie's Mr. Wang has improved compared to before, I don't know, but I feel that his movements have quite a bit of a comic style. As for the slapstick, such as after Mrs. Wang ran away, Mr. Wang encountered couples everywhere in the park, and feeding the fish when eating sesame cakes, etc., were all very adorable. The scene of Mr. Wang setting up a character-splitting stall: the clown singing on the open-air stage snatched his customers, and he angrily smashed the character stall. When Mr. Wang fell to the ground, just connecting to the "Joining the Army, Leaving the Kiln" section, Mr. Wang put the broken tabletop over his head, and the clown father continued singing "Escorting," which shows the director's cleverness.</p>

<p>Episode 8: Is it Illusion or Reality, Acting on the Spot; Is it Appropriate to Go or Stop, Being at Home Everywhere</p>
<p>Let's talk about Zhu Ai'ren having booked for the two Miss He's to go to Freedom Village next week. On Friday afternoon, she suddenly received a call from Wu Junsu, inviting them to go to her school to see a play on Saturday night. It turned out that the College of Arts of this Soochow University had a Department of Drama. Although this Department of Drama is not a required subject of the College of Arts, many university students study this subject. These male and female students also organized a Drama Comrades Research Association themselves, discussing and studying normally, and giving public performances two or three times a year. In addition, they also have theatrical performances when there are any public or private commemorative days. This is not a professional theatrical performance, but just something for those who love drama to use as entertainment. There is a small theater in the school, and although it is a small theater, it has seats for more than a thousand people. This theater is not only for theatrical performances. Sometimes, the school also holds lectures in this theater. Also, other cultural organizations in Suzhou hold major grand gatherings, or welcome foreign celebrities and invite them to give speeches, and they all borrow this theater. Because many cultural organizations are gathered together, Soochow University is always a part of it. But the theater is used the most often when it is open for film screenings. Could it be that Soochow University has opened a cinema as a side business of the school? This is definitely not the case. There are also many cinemas open in Suzhou, and Soochow University will definitely not steal their business. The films shown in Soochow University's theater are mostly academic. As everyone knows, the development of film in recent times is a great help in the evolution of the world. Its power for social education and cultural propaganda is the greatest, and it is not only for entertainment. Since the invention of television, the progress of film has truly been the supreme authority in the academic world. I don't need to say how far the progress of film has gone. Just saying that scientists can use film to explain everything they invent, and often what cannot be explained clearly in words, can be clearly understood by outsiders by opening the film. Of course, these films are popular and profound, and there are many kinds. In short, they open people's minds, help people's knowledge, and benefit the people. Recently, because of the progress of films in various countries and the extreme convenience of transportation, international films are exchanged and shown to each other. Currently, the most developed country in the world for films is still the United States, but the second country is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has the most films on academic subjects. Icebergs, snow islands, submarines, and airplanes are shown a lot, and the United States has recently changed its style. (85)</p>

<h3 id="e143">1939: Predictions from the American Film Industry <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yuan</p>
<p>Every year at the beginning, American film magazines often publish articles of the "Silver Screen Predictions of the Year" type. The following predictions were published in the New York Times, written by the famous film reporter Mr. Krauss. This article has two characteristics: first, it talks about general events in the film industry, different from other predictions that focus on the personal lives of stars. Second, it is specific about the names of the people involved and the months of occurrence, unlike general predictions that are vague and ambiguous. The strangest thing is that the predictions for January and February actually came true. Here, I will transcribe his predictions below:</p>
<p>January:</p>
<p>The names of five Canadian child star students will appear continuously in the telegraphic news columns of various newspapers, but it will have nothing to do with films.</p>
<p>(Note: This prediction has already come true, as the New York World's Fair invited five child star students in January to attend and perform at the opening ceremony on May 1st. This news was published in all newspapers.)</p>
<p>Louise Rainer, the lead actress in "The Good Earth," will receive some kind of award.</p>
<p>(Note: This prediction has also come true, as Louise Rainer flew across the United States last year and won the 1938 Travel Award, which was presented in January.)</p>
<p>February:</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin will officially announce the content of his new work.</p>
<p>(Note: This prediction has been confirmed. Charlie Chaplin released his new film "The Great Dictator" in February, with content satirizing dictators.)</p>
<p>The gold medal for best acting in 1938 will not belong to Bette Davis but to another more prestigious actress.</p>
<p>(Note: This prediction also came true. On February 23, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that the winner was Norma Shearer, the lead actress in "Marie Antoinette." Bette Davis's ranking was after Norma Shearer.)</p>
<p>March:</p>
<p>Famous director Frank Borzage will fall ill.</p>
<p>Carole Lombard will be involved in a lawsuit due to income tax issues.</p>
<p>(Note: The above two predictions have not been confirmed.)</p>
<p>April:</p>
<p>Clark Gable's wedding to Carole Lombard in Benne will be postponed for some reason.</p>
<p>(Note: Clark Gable married Carole Lombard late last month, and was not postponed for any reason.)</p>
<p>May:</p>
<p>Goldwyn will gather many famous writers to co-write a film script, but it will not be filmed in the end.</p>
<p>June:</p>
<p>Leslie Howard will finance and produce a film himself.</p>
<p>Major film companies will compete to purchase a famous script. As a result, MGM will win, but it will be prohibited from filming by the Film Censorship Bureau.</p>
<p>July:</p>
<p>Three Soviet defense films will be screened publicly in New York, one of which will cause protests from the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo will return to her home country again.</p>
<p>August:</p>
<p>Child star Shirley Temple will suffer from a surgical disease and will need surgery.</p>
<p>20th Century Fox Film Corporation will change its internal organization, and a certain star will have a lawsuit with the company authorities.</p>
<p>September:</p>
<p>Charles Boyer will receive a honorary award.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's new work will be completed, and he will announce his official divorce from Paulette Goddard.</p>
<p>October:</p>
<p>Mary Pickford's cosmetics company will make a significant profit.</p>
<p>Horror star Boris Karloff will travel to Europe.</p>
<p>November:</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's completed new film will be praised by some audiences, but opposed by others.</p>
<p>Robert Taylor will have a car accident, but will only suffer minor injuries.</p>
<p>December:</p>
<p>Child star Mickey Rooney will receive a strange gift for Christmas.</p>
<p>Among all film companies, the one with the highest profit will be RKO Pictures.</p>

<p>— Wei Shan</p>
<p>Tong Ling's Tan School sheng actor Li Yuqi, is currently thirteen years old, with a beautiful face and a smart mind. When he was seven or eight years old, he studied at a primary school in Shanghai, where he was exceptionally intelligent and always ranked first in every test. He especially loved Chinese opera. Later, his father fulfilled his wishes and asked him to learn Chinese opera from the famous dramatist Mr. Zhou Zichan. After a little guidance, he was able to understand it immediately. After three years of apprenticeship, he participated in several free performances in Shanghai, winning praise from the general public. Celebrities such as Yu Qiaqing and Du Yuesheng greatly appreciated him, and his stage name became well-known. Recently, he was hired by the Danggui Stage in Yantai and performed on stage for two months. Every day was fully booked, which shows that his art is extraordinary.

<p>Zhang Yicong Suddenly Suffers from Measles</p>
<p>The Yifeng Drama Society of the Carlton Theater gave its first performance of two Ben Wenson plays last night, and the attendance was extremely high. Kun Dan Zhang Yicong suffered from severe throat problems and was unable to perform on stage. The role of Su'e, which she plays, is very important, so Zhou Xinfang sent Ma Jinfeng to temporarily take her place and temporarily instructed her on the play.</p>
<p>Li Xinfu Resigns from the Class for the Second Time</p>
<p>Li Xinfu, a veteran martial arts actor at the Xianshi Amusement Park, felt that the rehearsals behind the scenes were not cooperating, which led to burnout. He had resigned from the class twice to the authorities, but was retained by Zhang Liankui, the manager behind the scenes. However, Li's determination to leave is firm, and he will still post a resignation notice to the backstage.</p>
<p>Xiao Wenbin to Perform as Empress</p>
<p>The Empress Theater wanted to hold Peking Opera performances and invited Yang Baotong and others to perform, but it did not work out. Now the theater has decided that from the 16th, the Xiao Wenbin Shanghai Opera Troupe will perform.</p>
<p>Xuan Gang Organizes a Dance Troupe</p>
<p>Musician Xuan Gang plans to organize a dance troupe to perform in various theaters in Shanghai in rotation. He has already started everything and is publicly soliciting talents.</p>

<p>The Sino-French Drama School has received many positive reviews from all walks of life after its first practical performance. Therefore, in order to meet the current needs, the school has jointly organized a weekly experimental performance with the New-Sino Company, and cooperated with the Shanghai Amateur Drama Association, which has a large number of excellent actors. The venue is the Green Mai Theater. The first phase has been decided to be held at 10:00 am this Sunday. The first play is "Little Husband" written by Zhang Min and directed by Bai Li, which is an anti-feudal play. The second is "The Affected Young Ladies," originally written by Molière and translated by Feng Zhizhong, which sharply satirizes those who are obsessed with modernity. It is a comedy, directed by Xu Xingzhi. It is also heard that the school and the New-Sino Company authorities advocate universality, so the ticket price is uniformly set at four corners (including refugee donations).</p>
<p>The famous British play "Strife" by John Galsworthy is a world-famous three-act social tragedy. Recently, the Juyi Society is rehearsing the play, directed by the famous director Wu Renzhi. The actors include Zhang Jie, Xu Li, Zhang Wanjun, etc. The performance is sure to be very exciting.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The names of the characters in the "Four Scholars" play are mostly meaningful</p>
<p>Group plays are the best to watch in Peking Opera. Like "Battle of Wancheng," "Famen Temple," and "Zhai Ying Hui," they are all large dramas performed by sheng, dan, jing, and chou, but compared to them, they are not as lively as "Four Scholars." This play has qingyi (Yang Suzhen), huadan (Wan Shi), zuogong laosheng (Song Shijie), yinglizi laosheng (Mao Peng), xiaosheng (Tian Lun), and wusheng (Bao Tongtian). In addition, there is a main character, Tian Shi, who is played by a tie dan. In fact, this role can be played by a handsome caitan, which would make it even more complete. All of the ten or so people mentioned above occupy important positions in this play, which is different from ordinary plays where only three or four protagonists are important, and the other supporting roles only appear and disappear at will. In general, people think that Song Shijie is the main character of the play, like Sun Juxian, Pan Yueqi in the past and Zhou Xinfang and Ma Lianliang now. However, if their supporting roles do not include outstanding huadan and huamian (comparatively speaking, Wan Shi and Gu Du are more important) to assist them, I am afraid it will be difficult to see the wonderfulness in many of the "cover kou." Because cover kou is the most close-knit and strict when two people answer or argue. Shanghai people say "hard-hitting," which is what this means. If one of the two people is weaker, or hesitates when answering, then the play loses its brilliance.</p>
<p>The person who wrote this play that day was indeed someone who was well-versed in the law and experienced in officialdom. He revealed all the dark secrets of officialdom protecting each other, engaging in favoritism and malpractice in the autocratic era, and the difficulty for poor and lowly people to redress their grievances. And he presented two righteous and courageous Song Shijie and Yang Chunlai, who avenged the murder of Yang Suozhen's husband on her behalf, and sued two frontier grand historians and a seventh-rank magistrate in one go. Although Song and Yang are both commoners, it can be said that they have no power to speak of, but one can be proficient in the law, and the other can be unyielding, as long as they seize the ironclad evidence of Tian and Gu's bribery, and discover their weaknesses in eating dirty food, then they are not afraid that their officials will be removed and their heads will be moved. Don't look down on Song and others as small people, as long as their reasoning is correct, they dare to clash with the officials of the first and third ranks. It was indeed possible to give the little people under the hoofs a sigh of relief, and also to give a warning to the general corrupt officials if such a play could be written in the feudal era.</p>
