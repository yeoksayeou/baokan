<p>開幕詞</p>
<p>重慶　（續昨）再就他所謂「解決中國事變」來說、他旣感覺到中國已不可征服、世界各國之側目而覷、就該澈底悔悟、把「東亞新秩序」等等一套、完全收拾起來、但他結束事伴的辦法、却是想成立偽中央政府、不但澈底污辱中國民族、而且要污辱世界各國、大家都知道他所謂解決中國問題、實際就是要滅亡中國、他所謂要妥洽各國、實際就是要排除各國、此種做法、簡直是自欺欺人、愈趨愈下、卽如近來他的國內、一方面有一部份人希望先緩和美國、更有一部份人大發其先拉攏蘇俄之夢、因爲如此、所以他要兩面拉攏、兩面恫嚇、但是弄到後來、必至無先無後、澈底失敗、我曾經在五中全會時說明、日人政略的失敗「根本旣錯、枝節就一無是處、」現在他所大吹大擂的「東亞新秩序」的聲明、已經一年了、爲這一個大錯、不但他的外交失敗、而且軍事政治各方面、無一而不着着失敗、在常人呢、失敗了就該回頭、但是日本、永不會反省、永不會改正、所以他愈失敗、只有愈錯誤、而愈錯誤、則必然愈失敗、在這九個月來、他軍事政治外交、無一不在失敗的路上急進、總之一句話、日人的失敗、是不可救藥的了、第二、我們要確信我們抗戰國策的確當、而堅定不移、說到這裏、我要提醒我們全體同志兩句話、第一句話、就是這次歐洲戰事幸而發生在我們中國抗戰旣起之後、第二句話、就是我們幸而在歐戰沒有發生的兩年前七月七日發動了對日抗戰、全國同胞必然明瞭前年七月七日發動抗戰是最適當的時機、而我們兩年多的奮鬥犧牲、實在有無比的代價、再則我們應該回溯我們（九一八）以來所定的國策，我在四次參政會中會說明、我們國策建築在四個原則以上、（一）反對日本侵略、以保障我主權領土行政的完整、（二）遵守國際公約、尤其是九國公約國聯盟的與非戰公約、（三）不參加防共協定、（四）外交完全自立自主、不受任何拘束、這四個原則、我們八年以來、遵守不渝、而且此後仍舊要本此奮鬥、以求得中國的獨立自由與平等、奠立三民主義國家的基礎、我們今後所應該努力的、簡單明白的、只有一件事、就是日本一天不覺悟、抗戰一天不停止、只要我們堅定不搖抗戰到底、則國際形勢、無論如何變化、日本決不能達到任何的企圖、第三、我們要信任友邦、專意抗戰、發揮中國自救救世的抱負、以貢獻於世界和平、我們相信由於世界上愛好和平的共同心理、歐戰終能得到合理的解決、我們的抗戰、始於抵抗强權的侵略必終於建築世界永久的和平、我們還可以斷言、各國問對於世界問題的觀察、現時或不能完全相同、但對於中日問題與遠束大局的觀察、則沒有不一致的、因爲中國抗戰的成敗、實際上是與世界各友邦的利害安危相一致、任何國家沒有不爲他本國眞正的利益打算的、所以敢斷言、決沒有一個國家、會犧牲中國而與其根本衝突的國家相妥洽的、但是我們中國對於各友邦、並不存絲毫倚賴之心、祇是憑着公理正義、與各友邦共同一致、達到世界和平的目的、因此我們不但完全要信任各友邦認識的淸楚、同時我們更要確守自助人助的格言、絕對的自强　勵、以期不負各友邦的交誼、無愧於伸張正義、裁抑强權、與確保世界和平的共同責任　第四、我們要認淸敵人製造僞中央政權、是他政略上更進一層最後的失敗、日本如果對世界與遠東的大勢、以及中國三民主義的革命力量、早有明白的認識、不存侵略野心、不背國際道義、就應該知道中國的獨立繁榮、纔是日本福利的屛障總之、日方一日不放棄他侵略的大陸政策、不撤回他侵華全部的軍隊、無論他用什麼方式、無論他造什麼謠言、而中日戰事、決不能結束的、祇要中日戰事不結束、那就無諭任何國家、決不會同他妥協諒解的、但在我們方面、正唯勝利已經有確切的把握、正唯今天抗戰的成敗、影饗於全世界的禍福安危、我們更不能不格外戒愼、格外儆愓格外的奮發黽勉、自强不息、希望大家在這一個重要的全會期問、聚精會神、檢討過去、痛自鞭策、刷新黨務、健全政治、使軍事成續、格外提高、使兩年餘前綫官兵犧牲奮鬥所造成的勝利基礎、得以完全收穫、以達到我們抗戰建國的成功、安慰我們總理在天之靈、安慰我們殉國殉職的先烈、和流離痛苦的一般同胞、（完）（十三日電）</p>

<h3 id="c11">歐戰前途蠡測 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>比荷兩國呼籲和平，斡旋息戰。英法已予答復·謂奠定永久和平的關鍵，繫於德國；德國尚未答復，殆將聲明德國迄未向英法宣戰，破壞和平的責任，在於英法。彼此推諉，彼此責難，故息戰言和，至少在目前已經絕望。自此而後，戰爭範圍的擴大，戰爭時間的延長，大勢在所不免了。</p>
<p>自開戰一直到目前爲止，在西綫雖則英法與德國對壘已歷三月，然而只限於小接觸，並無大規模的戰爭。雙方所着重的手段，不是軍事上的攻勢，而反是政治上的攻勢，外交上的攻勢；廣播宣傳的聲浪，多過砲彈的聲浪；政客們的搖旗吶喊，多過士兵的衝鋒呐喊；這當然不是戰爭的本態容詐若此文靜，而是過程中的一慕罷了。原來德國的作戰目標，在於波蘭，波蘭旣得，她的目的已達；波蘭的攻之易，克之速，這早在德國的預料中，所以不惜出之於軍事行動。德國對於西歐，就現階段講，是沒有什麼要求，其對英法最近提出殖民地的要求，也只是一種政治上以退爲進的政略，與英法討價還價，並不是出於她的本心。英法有龐大的經濟資源，有雄厚的重工業基礎，有强有力的海空勢力，不是像波蘭那般攻之易，克之速，這早也在她的預料中。這就是她對波蘭不惜貿然用軍事攻勢行動，而對英法只限於軍事防勢行動的原因；也就是西歐軍事一直在半睡眠　態中的原因。</p>
<p>但戰事的進行，如馬之下峻坂，是一發不可收拾，而必須到了一個終局。才能停止。德國對波蘭的旣成事實，要英法加以承認，這在德國，已十最小限度的要求；而英法方面，認為要恢復和平，不但要恢復波瀾的原狀，要恢復捷克奧地利的獨立，並且要德國尊重國際間的條約，這在侵略的納粹德國，都是不能接受的條件。而在英法方面，沒有得到一個可以停戰的理由，也決不會放棄他們的政策。正如英國自由黨巨魁蕯繆爾子爵所說：「現在還不是英法政府草擬和平條件或歐洲新秩序的時期。我們很明白，我們所需要的和平種類，是與凡爾賽和平條約不同。但在目前階段，必須集中於擊潰希特勒主義及那使歐洲毀滅的哲學上。英國人民最所需要者爲堅忍性。堅忍性比一切都需要，這在歷史上成就英國民族的偉大。」英國海相邱吉爾氏昨天在廣播演說中也述及「英國旣被迫作戰，則唯有保持戰爭，直至他方面厭戰而後已，」這就是說明在戰爭的相持階段中，和平是不可能的；那末自只有繼續戰爭下去，以決定誰勝誰負。現階段是一歐戰轉捩的樞紐，德國西進，或許擴張到大西洋邊—荷比或是其目標，荷蘭當局，雖否認德國對於她的威脅，但證以荷蘭軍開往邊境各要塞，及決堤放水，這說明荷蘭已感受嚴重的威脅。由於上次大戰的敎訓，在國際公法上，幾乎無所謂中立。只要有利於軍事行動，撕毀條約，侵犯他國的所謂中立，是正在從事戰爭的國家，在所不惜的。再從現代軍事策略來觀察，若要速戰速決，當然惟有採取攻勢，以完成其目標。總之，這一决比荷兩國斡旋和平的失敗，可以視爲德國所謂「神經戰爭」，所謂「和平攻勢」的失敗，亦可視爲歐洲大戰的前奏曲的尾聲。今後若非德國方面有何意外的急轉直下，則大規模戰鬥行將立即開始；攻勢必發動於德國，鋒銳或不免於比荷乃至於瑞士，否則絕無速戰速決的萬一之望。至於英法，殆將以守爲戰，以拖制敵。</p>

<p>倫敦　海相邱吉爾昨夜廣播演說、謂開戰以後之最初十星期、已證明協的國之優勢、英法恢復波蘭捷克生命之能力、與日俱增、英法曾屢决設法防止戰爭、維護和平、致今日不應發生之許多事件、因以發生、但英國今旣被迫作戰、則唯有保特戰爭、直至對方面厭戰而後已、非英法在此世界中所擁護之原則、歸於失敗、卽希特勒與國社黨政體、以及德國對於歐洲繼續不已之威脅、卒吿滅亡兩者必居其一、此乃事勢所必然者、人人極宜對此結實而煩悶之事實、下一決心、</p>

<p>比賽直延至二時三刻開始、孫錦順因傷缺席、由吳麒祥庖代、後防陣綫、大率採取記者昨日之貢獻、常局重視本報、足見所見相同、聯軍開球、塞德勒引軍西指、阻於兆祥、秋亭深入、亦被考萊脫截出、秋亭傳阿奎、遞交幼良、一脚高飛野外、接觸僅兩分牛鐘、義臣長傳、幼良傳中、祺祥直下、遇考萊脫、二十碼處、拉脚平射、鮑賽仲衝出營救、巳從左腋擦入、甚為淸淅、華聯光開紀錄、再五分鐘、吳祺祥於十碼處頭攻、鮑賽仲接而滑脫、球向上彈、亟再抱住、戴麟經巳如飛衝進、連球與鮑、一同滾進網、連進二球、歡呼震天、此後吳祺祥與許文奎互易位置、</p>
<p>三一佔先</p>
<p>十六分鐘、幼良開角球、祺祥頭頂、鮑拍出不遠、許文奎平射中的、惜因阿戴不及回出、致成越位作廢、不勝可惜、必高救險甚多、贊不絕口、相持至三十一分半鐘、派爾傳中、湯姆遜二十碼處猛力平射、秦必高撲救不及、流入右角、華聯遂失一城、成二對一、是時聯軍攻勢轉盛、華聯門前、時呈險象、三十七分鐘、祺祥頭攻、鮑賽仲拍出、秋亭右傳、阿奎一十碼處平射、鮑賽仲方吿撲落、幼良疾如鷹凖、猛衝進網、三對一華聯仍先兩球、四十分鐘時、必高接得湯姆遜高傳之球、塞德勒躍起一撞、球雖落網、因犯規作廢、莊友仁一脚踢出、上半時吿終、檸檬時屆、</p>
<p>迫成和局</p>
<p>再戰聲起、聯軍破釜沉舟、鐵騎縱橫、三分鐘時、派爾又於底綫勾射、洪光·必高雙雙撲空、球遂從必高腋下擦左柱進網、中綫開球、聯軍又深入底裏、陳洪光營救心切、誤撞派爾、十二碼鄧肯主射、從橫木底彈進、華聯一分鐘內述失兩球、竟被追成各三、大局遂於此奠定、雙方旣成均勢、局面愈益緊張、十五分鐘時、阿奎得義臣之遠傳、廿碼處兇射中的、因幼良越位作廢、阿奎兩箭均中紅心、均因越位而作廢、良深可惜、但聯軍之反攻、並未稍弛、廿五分鐘時、孟義良鼻端被派爾踢破、血流如注、受傷離塲、一分鐘後、又負傷臨陣、此後華聯進攻殊烈、蓋志在必勝、但終未成功卒成和局、</p>

<p>—民食安得不艱難—</p>
<p>米市自近兩朝一度轉機後、昨則漲風愈熾、乃以各客尖與滬市難合、身本綦重、久乏到頭、孰料一般囤戶舊態復作、乘此乏貨、當即大舉出手、投機操縱、一時形勢混沌、客家喊聲遂起、而本鄉作客且見此種佳景、亦即急起直追、興奮競購、無論粳尖悉為暢搜、故各貨遂一路上升、愈漲愈烈、其如杜米及社羊尖雖河下共到南港松江等帮貨十二三號、及由車輪運到常帮蘇嘉青泗楓練貨二十餘車、數的二千五六百包、結果無論粳尖各價、均較前市漲高一元左右、若常帮特粳已開三十二元、崑太高粳亦開三十元、青角窰菉中二十九元二三角、下二十八元、特蘆尖二十八元半、特羊尖二十八元、江北尖及京蕪尖二十七元半、陳元三十一元、新元三十元、成交數有二萬餘包、</p>

<p>— 斗</p>
<p>首批分幣券發行已久，可是買東西找來的尾數，仍以電車票或郵票居多數，註明代價的香烟畫片或汽車公司的二分三分硬幣居多數；過以前所大量流通着各式代價券，確已大為减少，分幣劵所塡補的，大約就是各項代價券所遺空隙的一部分。第二批分幣券雖也有五十萬，但社會上的需要過鉅，且分幣劵旣難以避免繼續流往內地，又不免給許多市民為玩賞起兌，五分一角的收藏下來，故實際上恐怕仍舊不敷流通。據本月十一日本報所載，中央銀行對第二批分幣券的分派，大致規定每一行號換二十元，區區二十元，在大店家不够作一天的找頭；小店呢，如肯儘量的找出去，維持不到半個月，定也完了。</p>
<p>分幣缺乏，不獨上海一埠為然，巳成普遍現象。現在滬寗滬杭各地，無不閙着銅元恐慌，瀾州，嘉興，松江，常熟，崑山……等虐較大客商，因當地郵局購不到多額郵票，每次來滬，總要帶數元至數十元郵票回去，以便零找之用。在上海郵票不是全新，大家就不要，布鄕下則連一踢糊塗的郵票都要，可見淪陷區人民苦痛，加深一等。（按在江北由蘇省政府統治下的地方，仍用銅元，可見淪陷區銅元的去路了。）</p>
<p>許多商店於由務上的需要，每日不得不向郵局購買郵票若干元作為尾找，否則就要無法周轉。公共租界中區以郵票作零找的店家更多。據傳聞如今每日找出全新郵票在三十元至五十元之間的有冠生園，永安公司天韻樓，胡慶餘堂雪記等數家；每日找出新郵票在十元左右的有五福齋，新雅酒店，惠中旅館，中法藥房，石路豐泰，梁蓮記酒家，大三元酒家等；每日找去新郵票五元上下的有陶園酒家，全興康，大三星，燕華樓，會滿記，淸一色酒家，新安公司，虞永和銀樓，樹仁堂，達仁堂，鄭家木橋阿馥館，和合興排骨麵店，大光明影戲院等多家；此外日找新購郵票在一元或兩元以上的有裘天寳，一角商店，香亞公司，中華國貨公司，小呂宋，南洋襪廠，南華襪廠，華華襪廠，王三和酒店，福祿壽，瑞康鐘錶行，永源五金號，胡開文，廣榮泰五金號，與若干家典當醬園等，其數不可勝計。當然，上而所述郵票的數目，時有增减上下的，此不過就傳述聊作比較罷了！</p>
<p>分幣的問題尙未完滿解決，市面上一元鈔票與角票不敷的現象又發生了，角票中允以一角鈔票為格外缺少。近幾天來常可看見許多烟兌店家，和若干營業繁盛的旅館商號，四出張羅一元鈔票及單雙角票，致角票貼水率，每千元已升至十元至十五元之間。目下年關漸近，這樣的現象若長此下去，無法予以糾正，則前途自極可慮，查角票單元票所以缺少的緣故不外兩種：一是淪陷區缺乏調節金融的銀行機關，上海所有單鈔票及角票，被各種商人陸續大量帶走，一是顯而易見的有人在其中操縱圖利。這一問題，說大不大，說小不小，眼前尙算病在初期，如果一天天嚴重下去，病重了發作起來，很可能市上的角票與單元票，會與以前的銅元一樣，忽然問不翼而飛，說完就完。彼時的苦痛，怕要比分幣恐慌，更深一層，故希望社會人士，大家注意才好，在目前還是一種預慮呀！</p>

<p>昨日上午、據外國通訊社英京倫敦及荷京亞姆斯特丹電傳、英國陸軍都頃宣佈、政府巳決定撒退華北英國駐軍、僅留若干必要部隊、用以保護英國人民之安全與資產、維持秩序、本埠中外人士、因當歐戰爆發之初、日政府曾以該國「不干涉」歐戰之理由、要求歐戰參戰國家、將日軍在華佔據區之駐軍撒退、故對華北英軍撤退之消息、極表注意、而此間外人觀察家意見、復以為目下駐滬英國防軍兩營、或亦將撤退一營、外間傳說、益為紛紜</p>
<p>上海不致　受其影響</p>
<p>昨晚從可靠方面探悉駐滬英軍司令部對英政府決定撤退華北英國駐軍消息、並未接得正式通知、各方電傳所述英政府決定、一概明言華北、並未涉及他處、故此間之解釋、咸認為上海不致受其影響、至日方之觀察、則以為英國此種決定、乃終於放棄在華北一切利益之初步行動、此間英國商業界、均表懷疑、據本埠某英國鉅商並為上海英國商會之會員吿記者稱、外間有認英國將放棄華北之利益者、堪稱係一種「愚眛之預言、」</p>
<p>倫敦電傳　撤一部份</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（十三日）倫教電傳英陸軍部宣布決定撤退華北一部份英駐軍、本市觀察家認為此訊意在駐滬英軍兩大隊中將有一大隊撤退、而留英軍兩大隊、分駐津滬兩地、查華北英駐軍除輔助隊外、另有三大隊為寶漢輕步兵隊、駐天津、西福資高地隊與東旭萊隊駐上海、英軍駐滬僅一大隊者、巳歷若干年、惟遇事故、則目他區借調英軍來滬增援、而達三大隊、目前東旭萊隊原駐上海區、而西福資隊則係香港借調來滬者、此次戰事苟未爆發、則西福資隊今當由高地輕步兵隊接防、而行將撒離上海者、或即西福資隊、但尙未能從駐滬英軍司令部獲得任何詳報、</p>
<p>日方表示　別具見解</p>
<p>本埠日本陸軍發言人、昨晚在新聞報導席上答記者之詢問稱、「英國之撒退其華北駐軍、顯為相信該地英僑之生命及財產能受日本陸軍保護之故、」記者詢、「據亞姆斯特丹電稱、英國此舉係受日本壓力之結果、未知閣下意見如何、」答、「余不信係受任何壓力之影饗、」日大使館發言人繼起述、完全同意此項意見、並稱、「余信央國政府如其不完全信任英僑之生命財產及利益能受日軍之安全保障、縱然歐戰發生、亦不採取此種步驟、」記者詢、「英政府此舉是否可以增進英日在華北之關係」、答、「此與封銷天津英租界事無直接之關係、惟天津種種地方懸案之解決有助於封鎖問題之一部份的解決、」日大使館發言人繼稱、「依余個人之所信、天津英租界問題、不久可獲解決、惟無人能預言將來事態之如何遭遇耳、」</p>

<p>中國對外貿易經調整後、輸出激增、輸入銳减、入超减少、貿易委員會以其全力促進土貨出口、所以並不受中日戰事以及歐戰爆發之影響、因此外匯基金愈見充足、法幣暗市價値飛漲、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>中國土貨　輸出激增</p>
<p>關於土貨之出口、今年第一·二·三·季爲六萬七千七百七十八萬七千六百九十元、比較去年同期增一萬一千七百八十九萬二千零二十二元、輸美土貨為一萬二千二百六十六萬六千元、較去年同期增六千三百四十四萬八千元、輸香港土貨為一萬五千一百七十萬零九千元、較去年同期减三千七百七十一萬一千元、輸日土貨爲四千七百六十三萬二千元、較去年同期减四千三百二十七萬三千元、輸英土貨為六千三百六十九萬八千元、較去年同期增二千三百八十九萬九千元、輸安南土貨為四千四百六十萬零二千元、較去年同期增三千三百七十四萬元、輸法土貨為二千五百六十二萬八千元、較去年同期增一千一百三十三萬七千元、</p>
<p>日貨傾銷　已見衰退</p>
<p>關於洋貨進口、自財政部頒佈禁止進口貨品辦法後、各奢侈品及非必需品一律不准進口、及轉口至非淪陷區域、今年第一·二·三·季洋貨進口為十萬零六千一百七十三萬一千五百六十四元、比較去年同期雖見增加、因日本貨傾銷淪陷區域所致、如日貨之輸入為二萬四千五百五十三萬元、較去年同期竟增一萬一千六百三十三萬四千元、至英美法三國輸入之洋貨、總値為二萬三千零六十萬零一千元、較去年同期减三千七百六十四萬三千元、惟自今年九月份起、洋貨輸入銳减為九千三百七十八萬一千元、較八月份减少三千六百六十一萬元、較七月份减少二千三百零九萬三千元、政府禁止洋貨進口之功也、</p>
<p>貿易好轉　今昔不同</p>
<p>對外貿易好轉後、凡非淪陷區域各關、如蒙自·思茅·騰越·龍州·北海·寗波·溫州·梧州等、均已轉變為出超、今年第一·二·三·季共十二個海關、出超為五千一百九十四萬七千元、入超各關為上海·天津·秦皇島·烟台·膠州·龍口·威海衛等、尤以上海天津膠州三關為最多、雖經政府竭力設法消除入超、總因所在地淪陷、一時權力所不及、對日貨由以上各關進口傾銷倫陷區域、無法予以禁止、惟目九月份起、入超回佔首位之上海關、忽轉變爲出超、計出超一千七百三十七萬四千三百五十三元、而天津關之入超、已自八月份之二千二百七十三萬八千元、降為一千零十一萬八千元此則證實中國對外貿易確已好轉、</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>人生最快樂的一回事，莫如男女之愛了，但是世間最悲慘的事，也算不和諧的婚姻了，在社會上有許多夫婦，常因不滿意對方而自怨自嘆，性情頑固者不惜將生命犧牲；故沒有幸福的結合，還不若獨生一世得快樂，但是人生旣以生殖為目的，况又天賦吾人以兩大慾望——食欲與性慾，故終究不能抗逆自然，所以唯一的補救，就是怎樣來充度婚後的求愛知識了。</p>
<p>欲研究求愛的方法，先決問題，必須明瞭男女愛情的來源，此一問題，實涉及醫學，蓋世上著名的無數醫家，咸一致認為男女之愛與精力有關，性學專家英國艾理斯博士，曾率直言之：「夫婦間眞正的愛情產自生殖慾」，這是至理名言，因為男女間春風一度之後，愈益親昵，不過欲使此種愛情維持永久，且使新的愛情不斷產生，則必須男子的精力健全，始可刺戟對方，如男子生殖無力，不能引起對方的快感，雙方在愛情生活上不能協調，則愛情會急遽低降，甚至雙方仇如水火，必致夫婦脫輻而後巳！</p>
<p>聰明的男子：你在花燭之夜，是否顧到你將來生殖力會日趨衰頽，如欲顧到這一點，那首先要避免縱慾，因縱慾之後，能爆發神經衰弱，早洩，陰萎，致增加對方煩惱，而堵塞了你求愛之門。</p>
<p>促成早洩陰萎，神經衰弱的原因，旣如上述，但治療之法，須從增精補血着手，故對症療法，首推德國梅倫博士所發明的睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，服後生殖機能活潑健全，面色紅潤，連服一季，五體繁榮，婦女須服女用「補　康」，該劑成分採自卵巢內分泌製成，故對婦女月終不調，婚後不育，一切子宮病症，均有特效，乳癟者服此允能增高乳峯，恢復健美。</p>

<p>— 肺病專家　盛在强醫師</p>
<p>除非乾咳，咳嗽患者，大多有痰，亦有無咳嗽而痰多者，皆為肺臟的病態；因痰為肺臟之分泌物，肺强者痰少，弱者痰多，內部有病則允甚：此因細菌侵蝕肺部，致分泌物增加之故；然細菌之繁殖，輙以痰塊為巢穴。故痰多者易生危險，試觀肺結核之進行，則咳嗽與咯痰劇增，反之痰量漸少，其病亦日就衰微，此稍有常識者，類能知之。是平素多痰之人，不可不深加注意。若一旦體力不支，變生不測，甚者成為肺炎，或可怕之肺壞疽，勢將措手不及。其幸而轉變為慢性者，則又往往變成肺癆。氣管擴張等，淹纏不愈。施治允難。因而抱病終身，或終途變起，殊屬可慮。此所以減除肺結核之呼聲，日囂於醫學界也。自余多年來之經騐，去痰鎭咳之捷徑，舍服用「補肺拿爾」一藥莫屬。猶憶前月初旬，有金漢祥君，先因流行感冒，繼發咳嗽咯痰不爽，的有兩月之久，屢醫不效，並又採用市上各項鎭咳止嗽之藥，均不能有何效用，而且反有時輕時重之症狀，痰色變黃，每日咳嗽可的一香煙左右，體重銳减，神疲力竭，經余囑服「補肺拿爾」，的服後之數小時內，咳嗽巳大為减輕，短期內即不復有咳嗽之現象。同時痰塊亦漸告稀薄而减少。亦終於在短期中完全治愈，神氣漸完，而體重亦漸增，以迄恢復未病時之健康。聞其椿萱年老多痰，亦囑服「補肺拿爾」而治愈。蓋此劑旣善袪痰，又為一種强壯劑。至其鎮咳之功，全特藥效，絕無麻醉性之劣質　入其間也。</p>

<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路　九號四川路口</p>
<p>精囊與睪丸，皆為內生殖器重要器官之一，為貯藏精子，或由睪丸送來精液之貯藏庫。如此處一旦被淋菌所侵，則曩日儲藏之精液，悉被毒害，人生生殖之重大任務，因以毀滅，一切不幸之事，皆由此發生矣。</p>
<p>淋毒性精囊炎，亦可分急性與慢性兩種，其發生之原因，多由攝護腺炎，輸精管炎等而成，為再發性副睪丸炎之根源。一般症狀，多為小腹膨滿，從精囊部之疼痛，放散於四周。或波及於肛門及會陰。而予以不快之感覺。其陰莖亦恒有咬刺狀，乃至搔癢狀之疼痛。此疼痛，往往成為精囊疝痛之原因。而精囊壓迫之疼痛，在排尿之際允甚。此時如仍沈溺於不良之手術，及迷誤於劣藥，必致一誤再誤，其生殖能力，必更至全部毀減以致不能挽救。故在此時，如能及早放棄不合理之醫治而改用最新發明之淋病特效藥「新克淋儂」，使其殺菌力量，能直達病灶，絕無副作用。一方更用德國感應靜電療法，及WettererX療法，輔戀情手術以矯正其病態，使將頻破壞之生殖重要器官，復歸完整。余對於此等療法，已有二十餘年之經騐，能確保病家脫離白濁之痛苦，同時可以使白濁患者，恢復生殖之機能。絕無失敗之例也診時：上午十時至下午六時，自卽日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角並贈「性病全書」一冊對淋病與性病有詳細的叙述。</p>

<h3 id="c98">天堂與雪茄 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 卞洛</p>
<p>每當失眠，思緒便像斷錢的紙鷂，落在那裏，沒有一定。有時也會想到一些有趣的事物，記下來作為隨筆之類，倒也是廢物利用。不知怎樣一來，想到過去看過的一張片子，</p>
<p>好像是以科學作號召的，實際却是張白人對黑人宣傳宗教的片子，特殊的是角色都是黑人。故事都採自聖經或傳說的聖績，若沒有看過聖經是很少興趣的。賣座殊為寥寥，中途退出的都有。</p>
<p>但，現在使我想起的，是其中描寫天堂的一節，除可駕雲飛騰外，還有分送雪茄，各人一枝，大吸特吸，並以此請上帝吸；這也許是黑人的天堂吧。聖經上的是否那樣，我不很知道。但，表演吸雪茄一幕時，很引起外國觀衆的哄笑，熊度是不大正經了。這樣使我聯想，外國紳士在女士們面前吸烟的拘束，似乎是黑人天堂幸福了。</p>
<p>然而這天堂確確實實還是紳士們所迭的，不過祗給黑人以上的人觀光觀光而已。</p>
<p>從天堂內是否可吸雪茄的問題上，使我覺得人的想像受了很可憐的限制，即對幸福的想像，也並不怎樣超人。宗敎家總以人之好惡，想像出天堂與地獄。曾經有位朋友對我說：他不信宗敎，因天堂內禮節太多，十分麻煩，並不快活云。他自承祇好徘徊於天堂與地獄之門外了。</p>
<p>自然，各人想像的天堂是不同的，要制定一個大家適用的天堂模型，似乎很費週折的。這是天堂的破產，宗敎家的悲哀。</p>
<p>人間終還是人間，雖然汚濁點，祇要我們勤於打掃。</p>
<p>有雪茄吃的天堂，至多不過是一個無傷脾胃的笑話；要是現實的那倒是二十世紀四十年代的大悲劇。</p>
<p>然而嗚呼，眞的嗚呼了！某種天堂却也非是理想的天堂吧。</p>
<p>我要去唱讚美詩了。</p>

<p>把行李檢點了幾次，每次都挑出了認為危險的東西，最後只剩了幾件破爛的衣裳，於是覺得可以安心了。太陽一落山，就和工塲裏的夥計們吿別，握了手，情感震動了他們的言語，把他們感勤的吿白顫抖得毫不連貫，然而我懂得，我是肩負了他們約期望而離開他們了。我匆忙的踏匕了街車。</p>
<p>碼頭上，海關的鐘才劃着八點，可是船要十二時開。袋裏的錢不够，我不能與高貴的旅客為伍，就坐了起碼的統艙，那裏只有幾條板凳，而所謂「大菜間」，可闊了，軟的凳，熱的手巾，而房艙，那更有意思，可以在家裏一樣的做夢。</p>
<p>可是我年來根本沒有好好的做過夢，幾個鐘點的旅程，算得啥！我只須忍耐一下。我沒有同伴，東西得自己看守，坐在板凳上不能鬆，一鬆會出毛病，東西被拿走是可能的，或者凳子被搶了去，等他們呼呼的在上面睡熟了，事情就難辦啦！我抵抗着自己的倦怠和小販的呌喊！挨過半夜，船在幽暗的江上開始啟行。</p>
<p>船出了吳淞口，為着倦意和午夜的薄寒，人們多蜷伏着打盹，舷外是一片漆黑，幾點浮標上的指示燈，一明一暗的，使人懷念起夏夜的螢火來。由這「螢火」的照耀，可以覺察到黑暗中有幾隻潦倒的巨舶行過。</p>
<p>這是一點也不合想像的旅行，午夜的寒冷和着倦怠交混成一種多麼難受的苦難呀！</p>
<p>當舷外的天色，能辨別一點憂鬱的灰綠時，水手養育着的金絲雀呌了起來，然而，我可已經支付了全部的精力應付寒冷和倦困了。這時我震奮的看着自己的船向金色的波瀾滑行！</p>
<p>船在朝陽中靠了港，我將在第三條港登岸。我記起了留剩在記憶中的一點累贅——一册日記。於是我又檢點了行李，把它取了出來，仔細的端詳了一番，卷首有自已的一個頭像，下面是註着「逆境日曆」，接着是幾行字，現在還依稀記得：</p>
<p>這是我寄跡在蝸牛的尾上</p>
<p>劃在空間的獨步的影子，</p>
<p>這是我的愛，憎，悲哀和快樂，</p>
<p>然而我將不加選擇的愛她。</p>
<p>有點惶惑了，這患難之子，她刻劃了我的困苦不幸，她刻劃了自己的窘迫，不安，逐放和希望的一串日子，它的眞實性是我愛它的理由，然而現在，這點眞實性，也將成為使我受累的原因了。</p>
<p>我凝起了與「過去」分手的决心，去吧，殘留在記憶裏的渣滓：——我把這一串日曆投給了金色的波瀾！</p>
<p>朋友！我的手有點抖了，我慷慨的背面，不免有點吝嗇的隱痛，加上它又從波瀾中浮了起來，而永不沉溺下去，多難受呀！</p>
<p>我惶恐了，所幸沒有一個人注意到，可是這黑色的封面，緋色的紙邊，永遠飄浮在江心，直到一點黑點小影。</p>
<p>現在，我已目送她跟着江流捲入黃海了，朋友：我很慚愧，我幾乎哭了出來，我眞的像喪失一個女兒一樣的悲哀了</p>
<p>我記起了這日曆卷首的兩句題詞，讓我從這裏找點安慰吧！</p>
<p>把它寫了，我是輕鬆了</p>
<p>我可以放下這記憶的負扭！</p>
<p>現在連這點紙上的記憶也投給黃海了，那末，「再見啦，過去的影子呀！」</p>

<p>一個指頭，不算什麼希罕。</p>
<p>抓住一根黑炭往牆壁上打圈圈記工夫賬的指頭，有什麽了不起。天下用這樣的指頭刻劃着人類的創痕，委實也不少</p>
<p>比方說得更逗人些吧，那也不過孩提們一個慣常摟在嘴裏，濕淋淋的那個指頭罷了。</p>
<p>一個指頭，無論怎樣的不安分，該是不會引起一個哲學家研究的興味，而違警罰法向來不曾注意到這個渺小的生命的毫末吧。</p>
<p>這回鄕友寄來一封信，說阿五在疆塲上作生命上最後掙扎之餘，囑托他的伙伴帶了一個指頭回來，打開來一看，眞是一條僵蠶的模樣；鄕下傳為一件驚人的奇事，說阿五也會道樣。</p>
<p>那個伙伴說：『阿五在河邊吃到一排子彈，在喊了幾聲，我蛇行似的奔過去，鴃他到一個墳塲的背後，敷藥，紮傷，他反抗，砍下這個指頭，沒有說別的祇是說這麼一句：「扳槍機的都用這一個……」隨即倒了！』</p>
<p>阿五是一個『打零工』，兼「吃肩頭皮飯』（註）的農人，常常出現在那些目耕農的家裏幫傭，前年中秋節吃過月餅之後，一個師團突然於星夜過境，他也就此好像失踪似的不見了。不知多少回數傳過來已經死在戰塲上的消息，但終於不能證實記。得阿五慣常為了幾隻麻雀竊食塲子上的稻穀，他總是把食指和拇指裝成一枝小手槍的模型，貼在瞇得祇剩一條縫的眼角間瞄凖那些麻雀。這次僵蠶似的指頭，也許便是那個驅散麻雀的指頭。</p>
<p>天下用這樣的指頭，刻劃着人類的創痕而完成新史頁者，委實不少。聞其歸而榮之，原屬不算多餘。</p>

<p>當新降臨時，人們多麼歡欣啊。心狄中蘊藏的希望巳熾成美麗的火，鬱積着的苦悶也向四方飛散，生命的力量在歌唱了！</p>
<p>人類的創造力產生了「新」，這是人們最偉大的本能，惟有創造能使人類進步，能增强人類的力量。</p>
<p>時代洪流的澎湃中，什麽都需要創造，古舊的都被毀滅了，都該以「新」的代替。</p>
<p>創造的價値，比什麼都可貴，「依法泡製」祇是愚人所為，而且以任何培植和努力，決沒有超越的成績；創造却能推動一切殭死，賦予純潔的靈魂，來點綴新的宇宙。</p>
<p>可是創造却不是美夢，永遠是一團虛幻，誰都有着創造的心，却有人沒有創造的力量</p>
<p>創造更不是一首詩，一支曲，可以長久吟唱；創造是永遠前進着的，牠和時代並行。</p>
<p>莫將創造看得渺小，眞正的創造，是一個過程，一條長路，要以工作，辛勞，忍耐，果敢，勇毅……相助，方能到達。</p>
<p>人們都有着創造慾，在計劃開始時，莫惦念着儌倖，必具有征服阻礙的精神，才有如願的佳音。</p>

<p>— 伊人</p>
<p>這次語文展覽會中，有瞎子表演讀書和寫字的一項。有一位慈善的朋友，看了大受感動，幾至流淚，並且回來對我說，他願意捐一點錢給他們，因為這種敎育實在偉大，應該帮他們一點忙。</p>
<p>的確，瞎子是人類中最不幸的。他們的一生，只有黑暗，而沒有光明。然而，人類畢竟是進步的，現在已經有了盲人的特殊敎育，可以彌補這種天生成的缺憾了。</p>
<p>這種特殊敎育中最特殊的是什麽呢？就是把我們原有的「方塊」，一律改為「拼音字」，瞎子熟練了拼音字的字母以後，就能和當人一樣的讀書和寫文章了。</p>
<p>於此，我就連想到不識字的人，我們常稱他們為「文盲」。他們為了不識字，的確，也非常痛苦。我們在電車站頭常看見有人問，「先生，這是幾路電車？」幾路電車，不是明寫着嗎？然而對於不識字的人，等於沒有看見。這是何等可憐的事！</p>
<p>那末，我們為什麼也不拿「拼音字」來搽除文盲呢？在目前，拼音字當然不及方塊字那樣的「正派」「貴族化」；然而拼音字一學即會，至多二三星期，就能讀書寫字，却是「大餅油條式」的容易大衆化。要不然，恐怕方塊字對於瞎子，是一輩子不會有緣的。</p>
<p>因此，識方塊字，可比方有錢的人坐汽車，讀拼音字是彷彿無錢的人坐電車，不妨各行其道，各得其所。如果為了我們自己已經識得方塊字，就要反對別人提倡拼音字，那就變成坐汽車的硬要反對別人坐電車，眞是不通之至。</p>

<h3 id="c103">黃柳霜從影的傷感 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 鈞陶</p>
<p>我們都知道黃柳霜是中國人，但是她並不是一個在中國長大的女兒，她長大的地方是美國天使城，（Los　Angels）的中國區。黃柳霜的父親名字呌黃三新，母親在未嫁之前姓李。常她在小時候，就抱有進電影界的希望，所以後來就改名為安娜曼黃，（Anna　May　Wong）這是因為預料這名字在影界中比較適合些的緣故罷了！</p>
<p>不久以前，黃柳霜曾做過一篇文章發表她對於從影的悲傷，其中有一段，她說：「當我進了電影界之後，就覺得自己已實現我懷抱了好久的希望，並且我在影片中近來亦都做女中角哩！我雖並不希望成為一個非常有名望的女明星，但是中國女子在好萊塢電影界中過銀幕生活的，除我以外，可以說是無第二人了！」</p>
<p>「在世界各地，有着好幾百萬的中國僑民，在美國亦有幾千，其中亦有少數的藝人。在這種情形之下，簡直使我有點奇怪，並且有點失望澳喪，為什麼呢？就是在好萊塢電影界中，沒有一個中國著名男明星的存在。這件事使我在銀慕上表演羅曼史的機會是無望了！但是我並不是因為沒有羅曼史而傷心，不過當我看見其他女主角在表演羅曼史的時候，就不得不使我有些感想了！」</p>
<p>黃柳霜是一個很熱心的中國人，在二年以前，她同雙親回到過中國，所以對祖國的情形比較瞭解，以後並沒有到祖國來過。常她回到美國之後，就與派拉蒙公司訂立了合同，拍攝幾部片子，最近她所主演過的片子是中華女兒，（King　of　Chinatown）是與亞金泰米洛夫共同合演的。此後所拍的是，＂NorthofSingapore”，這是一張以中國為背景的片子，內容大概比她回國前所攝的進步些，尤其自抗戰之後，好萊塢電影界一變已往的熊度，不會再有辱華影片的攝製了。</p>

<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>大鐘劇社星期日上午在璇宮劇院舉行首次公演。所演的雖只是三個獨幕劇和兩個舞踊，大部分却是有意義的。此時此地，給了觀衆不少的刺激和興奮。</p>
<p>「古墅之暮」是蘇聯的國防劇，寫一個女開諜怎樣被一個冒名的工程師捉住，機警且多變化；舞踊瑪德里姑娘一是揚帆自己創作兼主演的，這位吳曉邦的「得意門生」現在是更進步了，瑪德里不是常有民族英雄為祖國而戰麽？這歌舞演的正是一位民族英雄的愛人的送別出征。雖然是蘇聯和西班牙，也不妨說是中國。</p>
<p>吳天的創作「走」是最有意義的。一位音樂家耐不住一年來的苦悶，終於忍心割捨他那瞎眼的媽媽，深明大義的妻子，以及哭泣求乳的小孩，毅然決然的出走。在過去我們常看見報上記載着可敬愛的靑年們出走的消息，有的是受父母的鼓勵，有的是瞞着父母悄悄的離開。前兩天我們還在報上看見筆征隊和洪深馬彥祥等領導的演劇隊的消息。現在又看到這戲對於這些出走者，我們眞是父崇敬，父感謝，同時自己內心感到慚愧。呂吉演妻子，說道：「你去了以後我可以敎書，可以做些社會上有益的事。」這毅然的決定，拋撇了戀愛，以國家為重的決定，傳得全塲的掌聲。</p>
<p>吳天常以暗示來寫音樂的心境和現實的環境。比方說，音樂家問起巡捕拂曉凄淸，是吾感到苦楚，大約也想到他自己出走以後將要遭遇到艱苦的生活吧？他的妻子和他的母親都向他說起，他小的時候跟人家打架，打不過人家就躱到桃樹上去，但還是要跟別的小孩打。後來又說起，桃樹會開出爛漫的花朶來的，烏聲也將在樹間愉悅的嗚奏。這是多末好的譬喻，又是多麽意味深長的話呵！大鐘響了，這不凡的第一聲！</p>

<p>「費貞娥刺虎」是舞台上的一齣名劇，過去梅蘭芳也會拍過電影，但僅是片段的平劇化電影，現在華成所攝製的則是費貞娥誅暴全貞的整個悲壯的故事，由李萍倩導演，陳雲裳飾費貞娥。已於上星期在丁香花園攝影塲開拍。</p>
<p>對費貞娥有不良企圖的「一隻虎」一角，則由徐莘園担任，這一位銀幕上的中國大偵探陳查禮，結果是死於一個宮人之手：預料在陳雲裳徐莘園的演出之下，這一幕戲一定是十分緊張動人的。</p>

<p>The Agenda of the Congress Has Not Been Announced</p>
<p>Chongqing. Many important issues are awaiting decision at the Sixth Plenary Session being held in Chongqing, among which the issue of establishing a constitutional government is particularly important. The agenda of the meeting has not been announced, but it is widely believed that the congress will first consider the recent suggestions passed by the National Political Council, especially the one on establishing a constitutional government as soon as possible. Chinese sources here state that a National Assembly must be established before the constitutional government is formed to discuss and pass the government's constitution. The Sixth Plenary Session is expected to decide on the date of the National Assembly's establishment and the procedures for electing representatives. The Sixth Plenary Session will also likely consider China's foreign relations in light of the European war. This point may not differ significantly from the Chinese government's established policy, which was reiterated by Chairman Chiang yesterday. It is expected that the Sixth Plenary Session will formally reaffirm China's determination to continue the war of resistance against Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Opening Address</p>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday). Furthermore, regarding what he calls "resolving the China Incident," he should thoroughly repent now that he realizes that China cannot be conquered and that the world is watching. He should completely abandon the "New Order in East Asia" and all that entails. However, his method of ending the incident is to establish a puppet central government, which not only thoroughly insults the Chinese nation but also insults all nations of the world. Everyone knows that what he calls resolving the China problem is actually to destroy China. What he calls wanting to compromise with other nations is actually to exclude other nations. This kind of behavior is simply self-deception and is getting worse and worse. For example, recently, within his own country, some people hope to appease the United States first, while others are dreaming of winning over Soviet Russia first. Because of this, he wants to appease both sides and threaten both sides, but in the end, he will inevitably fail completely. I once explained at the Fifth Plenary Session that the Japanese political strategy's failure is because "the foundation is wrong, so every detail is useless." It has been a year since he loudly promoted the "New Order in East Asia." Because of this big mistake, not only has his diplomacy failed, but his military and political aspects have also failed in every way. For ordinary people, they should turn back when they fail, but Japan will never reflect, never correct itself, so the more it fails, the more mistakes it will make, and the more mistakes it makes, the more it will inevitably fail. In the past nine months, his military, political, and diplomatic efforts have all been rapidly advancing on the road to failure. In short, the Japanese failure is incurable. Secondly, we must be confident in the correctness of our national policy of resistance and remain steadfast. Speaking of this, I want to remind all comrades of two things. The first thing is that this European war fortunately occurred after our resistance against Japan had already begun. The second thing is that we were fortunate to launch the resistance against Japan on July 7, two years before the European war broke out. The people of the whole country must understand that launching the war of resistance on July 7 two years ago was the most appropriate time, and our more than two years of struggle and sacrifice have had unparalleled value. Furthermore, we should look back at the national policy we have set since (September 18th). I explained in the four sessions of the National Political Council that our national policy is built on four principles: (1) Opposing Japanese aggression to protect the integrity of our sovereignty, territory, and administration; (2) Abiding by international treaties, especially the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (3) Not participating in the Anti-Comintern Pact; (4) Foreign policy is completely independent and autonomous, and not subject to any restrictions. We have adhered to these four principles unswervingly for eight years, and we will continue to fight based on this to achieve China's independence, freedom, and equality, and to lay the foundation for a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. What we should strive for in the future is simple and clear, and there is only one thing: as long as Japan does not realize its errors and the resistance war does not stop for one day. As long as we firmly and unswervingly resist to the end, no matter how the international situation changes, Japan will not be able to achieve any of its goals. Thirdly, we must trust our friendly nations, concentrate on resisting the war, and demonstrate China's ambition to save itself and the world, so as to contribute to world peace. We believe that due to the common psychology of peace-loving in the world, the European war will eventually be resolved rationally. Our resistance war began with resisting the aggression of power and will inevitably end with building lasting world peace. We can also assert that the observation of various countries on world issues may not be completely the same at present, but their observation of the Sino-Japanese issue and the overall situation in the Far East is consistent, because the success or failure of China's resistance war is actually consistent with the interests and safety of all friendly nations in the world. No country does not plan for the true interests of its own country, so I dare to assert that no country will compromise with a country that fundamentally conflicts with China at the expense of China. However, we Chinese do not have the slightest reliance on friendly nations. We only rely on justice and righteousness, and work together with friendly nations to achieve the goal of world peace. Therefore, we must not only fully trust the clear understanding of all friendly nations, but also firmly adhere to the maxim of self-help and being helped by others, and be absolutely self-reliant and strive to live up to the friendship of all friendly nations, and be worthy of the common responsibility of upholding justice, curbing power, and ensuring world peace. Fourthly, we must recognize that the enemy's creation of a puppet central regime is a further and final failure in his political strategy. If Japan had a clear understanding of the situation in the world and the Far East, as well as the revolutionary power of China's Three Principles of the People, and had no aggressive ambitions and did not violate international morality, it should know that China's independence and prosperity are the barrier to Japan's welfare. In short, as long as the Japanese side does not abandon its policy of invading the mainland and does not withdraw all its troops invading China, no matter what methods it uses, no matter what rumors it creates, the Sino-Japanese war will never end. As long as the Sino-Japanese war does not end, no matter what country, it will never compromise or understand with it. But on our side, precisely because we have a clear grasp of victory, precisely because the success or failure of today's resistance war affects the good and bad fortunes of the whole world, we must be even more cautious, even more vigilant, and even more vigorous, self-reliant, and tireless. I hope that everyone will concentrate their minds during this important plenary session, review the past, and whip themselves painfully, renew party affairs, improve politics, make military achievements even higher, so that the foundation of victory created by the sacrifice and struggle of officers and soldiers on the front line for more than two years can be fully harvested, so as to achieve the success of our resistance and nation-building, comfort the spirit of our Premier in heaven, comfort the martyrs who died for their country and performed their duties, and the general compatriots who are displaced and suffering.

<p>Chongqing. The newspapers here today unanimously praised Chairman Chiang's opening address to the Sixth Plenary Session, considering it an important document of historical significance. The Central Daily News praised China's ability to wage a long-term war of resistance under Chairman Chiang's leadership, despite many military disadvantages. Regarding China's future, the newspaper stated that, in terms of the Far East, the dark period has passed and dawn has arrived, as the Japanese aggressors are increasingly reaching their end. However, in Europe, a pessimistic atmosphere still pervades, and everything is still uncertain. Only China is still moving forward with a firm will and conviction. The Xinhua Daily, the organ of the Chinese Communist Party, stated that although the rumor offensive launched by the Japanese side and its puppets between the Fifth and Sixth Plenary Sessions has completely failed, the sharp friction within is indeed regrettable. Therefore, the most important mission of the Kuomintang's Sixth Plenary Session is how to promote cooperation and unity between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If the Kuomintang implements democratic politics with a firm and frank mind and recognizes the people's political rights, it will be a significant contribution to the country and the nation.

<p>Chongqing. Since the National Thrift and Nation-Building Savings Movement Committee was established by the Ministry of Propaganda in conjunction with various agencies, it has spared no effort to promote its work. In order to develop it widely, it has been decided to organize branches in all provinces and districts across the country, and to organize directly affiliated branches in central agencies. The first step is to launch organizations in eleven places including Chengdu, Lanzhou, Xi'an, Guiyang, Yichang, Kunming, Qinghai, Ningxia, Guilin, Hengyang, and Qujiang. The General Committee sent Zhang Zhongyi, Wang Zishuang, Dong Xijin, Ma Yimin, Li Gufan, Zhang Yunbao, Wang Weizhong, Yi He, Fang Tingbiao, and Tao Xueqian to various places to prepare everything. They all departed Chongqing yesterday. It is heard that the Committee believes that overseas Chinese are enthusiastic and patriotic, and are especially willing to actively promote the thrift and savings movement. Therefore, it has jointly worked with the Overseas Department of the Ministry of Propaganda's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and the Ministry of Communications to send telegrams to the Consul General in Manila, as well as Luo Fins, Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Yang Yiqitai, Chairman of the Anti-Japanese Support Association, Wang Quansheng, Chairman of the Party's General Branch, and others, to actively publicize and promote the movement as much as possible.

<h3 id="e11">Conjecture on the Future of the European War <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Belgium and the Netherlands are calling for peace and mediating a ceasefire. Britain and France have already responded, stating that the key to establishing lasting peace lies with Germany. Germany has not yet responded and will likely declare that Germany has not declared war on Britain and France, and that the responsibility for destroying peace lies with Britain and France. They are shifting blame to each other and accusing each other, so a ceasefire and peace are at least hopeless at present. From now on, the expansion of the war's scope and the extension of the war's duration are inevitable.</p>
<p>From the start of the war until now, although Britain and France have been facing Germany on the Western Front for three months, it has been limited to small contacts and there has been no large-scale war. The means that both sides emphasize are not military offensives, but political and diplomatic offensives; the noise of broadcast propaganda is more than the noise of artillery shells; the waving and shouting of politicians is more than the charge and shout of soldiers; of course, this is not the true state of war, but a scene in the process. Originally, Germany's operational goal was Poland, and once Poland was obtained, its goal had been achieved. The ease with which Poland was attacked and the speed with which it was captured were long expected by Germany, so it did not hesitate to resort to military action. Germany has no demands on Western Europe at this stage. Its recent demand for colonies from Britain and France is just a political strategy of advancing by retreating, bargaining with Britain and France, and does not come from its heart. Britain and France have huge economic resources, a strong heavy industrial base, and strong naval and air power, and are not as easy to attack and capture as Poland. This was also expected by Germany. This is why it did not hesitate to use military offensive action against Poland, but limited itself to military defensive action against Britain and France; that is why the military situation in Western Europe has been in a state of semi-sleep.</p>
<p>But the progress of the war, like a horse running down a steep slope, cannot be stopped once it starts and must reach an end before it can stop. Germany's accomplished fact of Poland must be recognized by Britain and France, which is Germany's minimum demand. On the other hand, Britain and France believe that to restore peace, not only must the original state of Poland be restored, but also the independence of the Czech Republic and Austria must be restored, and Germany must respect international treaties, all of which are unacceptable to the aggressive Nazi Germany. On the other hand, Britain and France will not abandon their policies without getting a reason to stop the war. As Lord Samuel, the great leader of the British Liberal Party, said, "Now is not the time for the British and French governments to draft peace terms or a new European order. We understand very well that the kind of peace we need is different from the Treaty of Versailles. But at this stage, we must concentrate on defeating Hitlerism and the philosophy that is destroying Europe. What the British people need most is perseverance. Perseverance is more important than everything else, and it is what has made the British nation great in history." British Secretary of the Navy Churchill also mentioned in his radio speech yesterday that "Britain is forced to fight, so it can only maintain the war until the other side is tired of fighting." This shows that peace is impossible in the stalemate stage of the war; then we can only continue the war to decide who wins and who loses. The current stage is a turning point in the European war. Germany's westward advance may extend to the Atlantic coast - the Netherlands or Belgium is its target. Although the Dutch authorities deny Germany's threat to it, the fact that the Dutch army has been sent to key fortresses on the border and that the dikes have been breached shows that the Netherlands has felt a serious threat. Due to the lessons of the last war, there is almost no such thing as neutrality in international law. As long as it is beneficial to military operations, tearing up treaties and violating the so-called neutrality of other countries is what countries engaged in war do not hesitate to do. Furthermore, from the perspective of modern military strategy, if you want to quickly resolve the war, you must take the offensive to achieve your goals. In short, the failure of the Belgian and Dutch mediation of peace can be regarded as the failure of Germany's so-called "war of nerves" and "peace offensive," and can also be regarded as the end of the prelude to the European War. If there is no unexpected and sudden reversal on the German side in the future, then large-scale battles will begin immediately; the offensive must be launched by Germany, and its sharp edge may not be spared Belgium, the Netherlands, or even Switzerland, otherwise there is absolutely no hope of a quick resolution. As for Britain and France, they will likely fight defensively and use delay to restrain the enemy.</p>

<p>Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura today for an hour. It is reported that the British Ambassador presented Nomura with a note informing him of the upcoming reduction of British troops stationed in North China. The note stated, "The British government, in accordance with the Boxer Protocol of 1901, stationed troops in North China. However, due to the military necessities arising from the European war, it has decided to station in North China only the number of soldiers necessary to protect British property and maintain peace and order." The note also stated that this decision has been communicated to all countries entitled to station troops in North China under the 1901 Protocol. This decision by Britain is welcomed by the Japanese, who claim it is in line with the Japanese government's proposal on September 5th, requesting all belligerent nations to "eliminate all possible causes of unforeseen events between them and Japan in China." The number of British troops to be withdrawn is not yet known. According to semi-official Japanese sources, there are currently about 1,000 British soldiers in North China. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London - According to British official sources, there are currently 1,000 British troops in North China, including Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanhaiguan. The government has now decided to withdraw 800 of them. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mr. Craigie stated to the Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura recently that this action by Britain does not affect British interests in China. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris - Regarding the withdrawal of troops from North China by Britain and France to a certain extent, the Ministry of War has issued a statement saying that, in accordance with the 1901 Protocol, the signatory countries may station troops in certain places in North China to secure the sea route to Beijing. At present, only the governments of Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan still enjoy this right. With the outbreak of the European war, the governments of Britain and France believe it is appropriate to withdraw a portion of their troops to transfer them elsewhere. Therefore, it has been decided to transfer the majority of the troops back to their home countries. However, the assets held by each country in various places in Beijing will still be protected, and the original right to station troops will still be retained. The British and French concessions in Tianjin will still maintain a considerable number of troops to maintain order. This decision has been communicated to the governments of the other signatory countries. In addition, the French concession in Shanghai still has a considerable number of troops. The original police force in the French concessions in Hankou and Guangzhou has been greatly reinforced to replace the troops. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. State Department stated that the status quo of the American troops stationed in North China will not be changed due to the partial withdrawal of British troops there. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan Mr. Craigie formally notified the Japanese Foreign Minister today, stating that Britain has decided to withdraw most of the British troops in North China due to needs elsewhere, leaving only a small number of troops in Tianjin to protect British property and maintain order. The Japanese side is very satisfied with this decision by the British side, considering it an initial indication of Britain relinquishing interests in North China. News outlets believe that this action by Britain demonstrates improved relations between Britain and Japan and that pending issues between Britain and Japan are expected to be resolved soon. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>London - After the War Office announced last night that the majority of British troops in North China would be withdrawn, reliable sources stated today that British troops in Shanghai may also be withdrawn in the future.

<p>Tokyo - According to Japanese sources last night, two German cargo ships that had been staying in Nagasaki since the outbreak of the European war sailed elsewhere on Saturday night. It is believed that the two cargo ships have evaded the British naval patrol. One of the German ships is 6,100 tons, and the other is 5,173 tons. Both were carrying soybeans from Korea to Rotterdam. Due to the outbreak of the European war, they were forced to seek refuge in Nagasaki. It was widely rumored last week that these two German ships had unloaded the soybeans and loaded coal instead. According to observations by several naval experts, the actions of these two German ships seemed to be to refuel German warships operating in the Pacific. When the two German cargo ships were loading coal in Nagasaki, rumors circulated that the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" had arrived in the Pacific from the Cape of Good Hope.

<h3 id="e16">Churchill Explains the Meaning of the Current European War: Not Just the Elimination of Hitler Leading to Democracy, Allies Have Been Dominant for Ten Weeks <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>London - First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill said in a radio address last night that the first ten weeks since the beginning of the war have proven the superiority of the Allies. The ability of Britain and France to restore the lives of Poland and Czechia is increasing day by day. Britain and France have repeatedly tried to prevent war and maintain peace, leading to many events that should not have happened. However, since Britain is now forced to fight, it can only continue the war until the other side is tired of war. One of two things must happen: either the principles that Britain and France uphold in this world fail, or the Hitler and Nazi regimes, as well as Germany's continuous threat to Europe, are completely destroyed. This is inevitable. Everyone should make a determination about this solid and disturbing fact.</p>
<p>Churchill then spoke of the Netherlands and Belgium, saying that Germany had given solemn guarantees to these two countries, but now it has concentrated large forces on their borders. I do not want to predict whether Hitler will be driven mad and commit this greatest sin, but I can say with certainty that the fate of the Netherlands and Belgium is also the fate of Poland, Czechia, and Austria, and it will be decided by the victory of Britain and France. If Britain and France fail miserably, everyone will be slaves, leaving only the hands of the United States to protect human rights. If Britain and France do not perish, then these countries will also be saved and restored to life and freedom. Although Britain does not ignore the strength of the enemy, it is not disturbed by its vicious threats and is prepared to endure the hardships when its threats become a reality. The British people have made various preparations at the beginning of the war, and their calmness and determination are commendable. Now, ten weeks into the war, the British Navy and Air Force have both strengthened compared to before, and the Army has also doubled. The attacks of German submarines have been controlled. Britain's global business is continuing with 4,000 ships, of which 2,500 are constantly traveling at sea. The superiority of the British Air Force in terms of pilots and aircraft has indeed exceeded that of the enemy. In combat, our aircraft have shot down fifteen German overseas aircraft without losing a single one of our own. Our science applied to war is already superior to that of the enemy, and it is still gradually improving.</p>
<p>Churchill continued to talk about the various events that are beneficial to Britain, saying that Italy, which we were previously worried about being dragged away from its historical relationship with Britain and France in the Mediterranean, is now strictly adhering to neutrality, and its relationship with Britain and France will be even more fruitful in the future. As for Japan, no new disputes have arisen between Britain and Japan. Italy and Japan had previously joined the German side in the Anti-Comintern Pact, but now they find it difficult to blindly follow Hitler and Ribbentrop's capricious actions. As for the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance treaty, its importance cannot be underestimated. The Soviet government represented by Stalin has forever shattered Germany's dream of advancing eastward. The Soviet Union, like a bear, has blocked Germany's path to the Black Sea with its left paw and seized control of the Baltic Sea with its right paw. No matter how history records this event in the future, the situation we must examine now is extremely clear: Germany's eastward advance has been blocked, and it must seek to achieve its goals in Britain and France, or perish. Based on my experience in the last war, I do not want to be overconfident. I know that the future will be fraught with storms and dangers, but I feel that today's Germany is weaker than the Germany that was forced to beg for a truce by the Allies and the United States twenty-one years ago. I also believe that the German government is aware that it has no certainty of success, because Germany today looks around the world and sees no friend who looks favorably upon it. Italy has turned its attention elsewhere, Japan is also hesitant, Turkey and the Muslim countries are now striving to advance, and India and China, no matter how they feel about other events, will certainly not welcome Germany's victory. It is no secret which side the United States sympathizes with. The Soviet Union is only giving Germany a hard stare. Therefore, the whole world today is opposed to Hitler and his ideology. Even within Germany, there are millions of people who do not support the various evils and corruption created by the Nazi machine. Let us muster our courage to deal with various complexities and dangers, because the final elimination of Germany's abominable ambitions can pave the way for the peoples of all countries to move towards unity, and the scale of this unity is far beyond what we can achieve without this war. I have a close friendship with Prime Minister Chamberlain, and I do not fully agree with all of Chamberlain's opinions. However, Chamberlain is a very strong person with a strong personality, and he is now seeking victory with a strong attitude, just as he worked hard for peace in the past. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>London - Diplomatic sources here recently stated that Britain does not intend to completely blockade Germany, because this move conflicts with international law, and the Baltic Sea is not under the control of the British Navy. Fortunately, the measures for inspecting wartime contraband have become increasingly effective and are sufficient to restrain Germany, and they do not excessively delay the ships of neutral countries (each inspection averages no more than forty-eight hours). Therefore, there is no need to intensify the blockade of Germany. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>Amsterdam - According to news from Vigo, ships anchored in the port by Britain and France are very worried after learning that German submarines have been discovered on the Atlantic route they must take to return to Britain and France.

<p>North Sea Coast - A special correspondent for Haitong News Agency reported today on the German Air Force's reconnaissance of the North Sea and bombing of British destroyers, stating, "The German air squadron is conducting reconnaissance of the North Sea today. This reconnaissance and bombing has not been carried out just once since the start of the war. As a result, the British fleet is keeping a respectful distance. Battleships and cruisers do not dare to appear in the North Sea. After a two-hour flight, our group arrived in British territorial waters, flying hundreds of meters high. Looking down through binoculars, we discovered six plumes of black smoke. Upon closer inspection, they were six British destroyers. When the six ships caught sight of the German Air Force, they opened fire, firing a total of seventeen shells, none of which hit their target. At that time, we were flying as high as three thousand meters. We dropped three bombs. The first two bombs did not hit the British destroyers, but whether the third bomb injured them is impossible to determine due to the high altitude. However, we have safely completed our North Sea reconnaissance mission." (Haitong, 13th)</p>

However, during the period of restrictions, people will be allowed to purchase linen if they have festive events. (Haitong, 13th)</p>

<p>The Hague - Prime Minister Gerbrandy Colijn of the Netherlands recently delivered a radio address to stabilize the people's hearts, stating, "There are many alarming words in the news coming from foreign countries. People should not completely believe them. It is natural for the belligerent countries to exaggerate the intentions of the enemy. The mobilization of our country's army is not just for show. Its size is directly proportional to the degree of tension on the border. However, this does not mean that the threats our country faces have become acute." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Brussels - Belgian Defense Minister General Denis announced in a radio address tonight that the Belgian army is strong enough to cope with any eventuality. He said, "After taking various protective measures in the military recently, the army's organization has been perfected and can be deployed at any time. I am very optimistic about the future. However, so-called optimism is not a dangerous, blind optimism. On the contrary, what I am saying is based on facts that I know well. The optimistic mentality is based on these facts. Our country's army is not only strong, but also determined to defend the country. Furthermore, the progress of various measures recently adopted is excellent. The people of the whole country can unite and enthusiastically support the current administrative system and be the backing of the army. In short, our country does not threaten other countries, but if our territory and democratic system are threatened, we will definitely rise up to defend them until the last person." Observers here commented that this is an indirect warning to Germany about threatening Belgium's neutrality and independence, and the tone is resolute to the extreme. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>Geneva - A semi-official British report received in Paris yesterday morning stated that Germany had reiterated to the Netherlands last week that if the Netherlands strictly adheres to its neutrality policy, then Germany will also respect its neutral status. However, this report has not been confirmed by Berlin and The Hague, so international figures consider it unreliable. It is believed that this is a probing action by the British intelligence department, wanting to induce Germany to issue a denial in order to prove that Germany has no intention of respecting the neutrality of the Netherlands. Swiss press sources believe that the reason why Swiss newspapers did not publish this news is that they do not want to be exploited. (Haitong, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris - A correspondent for the Paris Daily News in Sullyecker claimed that according to news directly from Berlin, the reason why the German army has not invaded the Netherlands so far is due to the strong intervention of senior members of the German command. Some generals fear that this kind of invasion will lead the United States to actively participate in the war. The correspondent also claimed that this invasion was advocated by Hitler and a group of Nazi extremists. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>Berlin - According to observations here, Germany does not seem to be able to submit a reply to the peace appeal of the Netherlands and Belgium. Haitong News Agency learned from well-informed sources that the note is currently being carefully studied by the Berlin authorities. It must be carefully studied before a reply can be made. The German government has instructed its ambassadors to the Netherlands and Belgium to convey this intention to the governments of their respective host countries. Regarding the reply made by British King George and French President Lebrun, authorities here refused to comment, only stating that the note is also being studied. Regarding the point in the British and French replies that the annexation of Austria by Germany must be cancelled, senior Nazi officials told Haitong News Agency reporters that this proves that the peace that Britain needs is a peace that destroys Germany. It must be understood that the annexation of Austria was based on the right of national self-determination, and the "new world" that Halifax seeks is to suppress the right of national self-determination.

<p>New York - Regarding the mediation of peace by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, the replies made by the heads of state of Britain and France, the radio address given yesterday by British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill, and the threat of Germany invading the Netherlands and Belgium, various morning newspapers here have combined and commented on this matter. They all said that the war goals of Britain and France have been clearly presented by the heads of state of those countries and First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill. The New York Times wrote that the unfair treatment that Germany has inflicted on Austria, Czechia, and Poland must be compensated, and the aggressive threats it has inflicted on European countries must be lifted. This is where the war goals of Britain and France lie, and they should be sympathized with. If Germany invades Belgium and the Netherlands, then the great value of these war goals will become more and more obvious. The neutral countries will also become more and more indignant towards Germany. Even in terms of U.S. public opinion, it will cause incalculable influence. The New York Tribune wrote, "Sooner or later, there will be a major struggle between the Nazi Party, representing 80 million people, and the Anglo-French nations. Before this struggle appears, there is no basis for peace in Europe, and how can we easily talk about peace?" (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>Chicago, USA: The University of Chicago held a symposium today. Republican leader Frank Knox, the vice-presidential candidate in the 1936 election, immediately expressed his views, stating, "When a peace conference is held after the end of the European war, the United States can only send observers to attend. In my opinion, there is only one way to guarantee peace: to divide the world into three major economic units, one for the Americas, one for Europe, and one for the Far East. Among them, European countries should establish a federal system, based not on political concepts but on economic concepts. In addition, due to the special problems in the Far East, countries should establish a customs union to form an economic unit." University of Chicago Professor Henry Schultz then spoke, expressing his opposition, stating, "Dividing the world into three units will only cause disturbances and confrontation. What is needed now is cooperation between all countries in the world, not just between countries in one hemisphere." (Havas Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>London: Well-informed sources here have said that the organization of a neutral bloc by the Balkan countries can now be considered a fait accompli. The participants will include Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. It is said that these countries have reached a final agreement on the following two points: (1) Hungary and Bulgaria will temporarily abandon their territorial claims; (2) The troops of the Balkan countries stationed near the borders of neighboring countries will be simultaneously withdrawn within a short period of time. According to some observers, it will not be easy for the Balkan countries to form a strong bloc, because, firstly, it is still unknown whether Bulgaria will agree to shelve its demand for access to a seaport on the Aegean coast, and secondly, the Italian government, which previously expressed support for the idea of forming a neutral bloc, has now adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, it is generally believed that if this bloc can be established, it will be a great gain for Britain and France, if not a direct diplomatic victory, because this move will stabilize the situation in the eastern Mediterranean and strengthen the Anglo-French-Turkish mutual assistance pact.

<p>Capital of Finland: According to official sources, the Finnish delegation will return home from Moscow this evening. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden: The Finnish delegation has decided to return from Moscow. Soviet newspapers are once again attacking Finland. Upon hearing this, people here have had a bad impression. "Svenska Dagbladet" reported that Finland has made as many concessions as possible. If the Soviet Union is not sincere, the Finnish delegation has no need to stay in Moscow. "The independence and national self-determination of the Nordic countries will never be abandoned. Finland is now fulfilling this responsibility, which is very painful but worthy of pride." (Havas Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko stated today that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations have now broken down. Finland's concessions have reached the point where no more concessions can be made, but they still cannot satisfy the Soviet Union's demands, so what is the point of continuing negotiations? Therefore, the government decided to recall Finnish chief negotiator Juho Kusti Paasikivi within twelve days. (United Press Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Capital of Finland: Regarding the current negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko told foreign reporters that our country has made great concessions to the Soviet Union's demands. The country's security, especially the security of the Leningrad area, has been guaranteed. However, various demands that would hinder our country's security cannot be accepted. The Soviet Union claims that our country has mobilized troops near its border, but this is not the case. Furthermore, the representatives of Finland and the Soviet Union have not continued negotiations for the past four days, but the two sides have exchanged letters, explaining their views, and have agreed that the current negotiations should not be rushed. Therefore, even if our delegation returns from Moscow, it should not be considered that the negotiations have broken down. In fact, if the representatives of the two countries cannot continue negotiations in the shortest possible time, our delegation may return home for a while, but whether it will happen and when it will happen have not been decided. In short, Finland and the Soviet Union will not resort to arms. The content of our counter-proposal is not convenient to publish at this time to avoid hindering the progress of the negotiations. (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet naval newspaper "Red Fleet" recently published an article entitled "The Problem of Soviet Maritime Defense in the Northwest," revealing the demands that the Soviet government has made to Finland. It stated that the Soviet Union demands that Finland cede a naval base near the port of Hanko and allow it to build fortifications on the eastern islands of the Gulf of Finland and in the Styur Sund area, especially on the islands of Bolshoy Tyuters and Gogland, and the port of Humaljoki on the Karelia Peninsula. As for Hanko, if the Soviet Union establishes a naval base there, it will be impossible for foreign fleets to enter the Gulf of Finland. Even if the enemy occupies the Åland Islands and attempts to enter the Gulf of Finland through the waterway between the islands and Hanko, it will be impossible. As for Bolshoy Tyuters and Humaljoki, the Soviet Union must build defenses on these islands and ports to protect the area near Leningrad. In addition, the islands of Seskär, Lavansaari, and Tyytärsaari, east of the island of Hanko in the western Gulf of Finland, are the gateway to the Soviet port of Kronstadt. If they are not held by the Soviet Union, Leningrad cannot be properly defended. Even the current border between Finland and the Soviet Union in the far north is too unnatural and needs to be revised." The newspaper concluded, "For the sake of Finland, only by cooperating with the Soviet Union can it resist foreign air raids." (Havas Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Political figures here believe that if the Soviet authorities do not invite the Finnish delegation to hold negotiations, the delegation will leave Moscow today or tomorrow.

<h3 id="e34">British Press Magnate on Trial in London: Lord Rothermere Testifies About Diplomatic Activities <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>London: The case of Lord Rothermere violating his contract opened in the High Court today. Rothermere detailed the process of the contract for an annual remuneration of £5,000, stating that the first contract was signed in July 1932. At that time, Vere Harmsworth wrote to Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe, discussing the accidents that might occur in Germany and Hungary, asking her to report the situation at any time, and instructing him to contact Queen Nina of Greece. The first check for £5,000 was paid at that time, and another £3,400 was paid twice as expenses until December of that year. He also promised to pay another £5,000 each in January 1934 and January 1935. Rothermere denied that the payment of the first £5,000 was conditional on the Princess not accepting £25,000 for writing for a newspaper. When the judge asked about the libel case in the French newspaper, Rothermere testified that this matter was quite serious for him and the Princess. After a detailed investigation, he accepted the advice and ignored it, but the Princess was still free to take any action she wished on this matter. He told her the news he had obtained in France and did not coerce her to sue the French newspaper. Rothermere admitted that in a certain payment, he had mistaken £5,000 for £500, but he was usually not astute about money, so such mistakes were not surprising. In 1936, the Princess came to visit, saying that she had to undergo a very dangerous operation and would need a long period of recuperation. Later, due to his company's request to continue her service, he agreed to find her tasks in 1937 and 1938. However, from 1938, he resigned from all positions due to old age and took a rest. Before the Princess set off for Berlin for vacation in January of that year, he paid her £1,700. Since then, he has not asked the Princess to continue to serve him. In total, from July 1932 to January 1938, the amount paid to the Princess amounted to more than £51,000. The judge questioned Rothermere in detail about his participation in the attempted restoration of Hungary and the articles he published in the "Daily Mail." Rothermere replied that one of the articles he wrote was entitled "I Wish to Be Friendly with Germany," but this article was published before Hitler's rise to power. Rothermere denied that he had said that if the German-Austrian royal family were restored, he would occupy a considerable position in history. The reason he was involved in the Hungarian affair was that after Hindenburg's death, the whole of Central Europe would fall into chaos. The only way to stabilize the situation was to restore the German-Austrian royal family. Rothermere did not say that the Princess's task was not only as an envoy, but sometimes she would convey his opinions to Hitler, Hungarian Regent Horthy, and the German Crown Prince, etc. The trial was then adjourned for continuation.

It is estimated that it will take several years to fully repay the debt. (Havas Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Ma Chaojun Describes His Journey Through Ten Southeastern Provinces: A Glimpse of the Situation <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Former Nanjing Mayor Ma Chaojun, who recently led a comfort mission through ten southeastern provinces, has now returned here and described the lives of the people in the areas nominally controlled by the Japanese, which is surprising and exciting. He said that his trip covered 8,000 miles. In addition to various other observations, he also saw the emergence of new troops. These new troops are experienced, brave, and serious, and are prepared to fight. Ma Chaojun especially praised the young women's service corps that assisted in educating children and women. When Ma Chaojun mentioned the prosperity of the areas he passed through, he said that Zhejiang Province's revenue for the last fiscal year was 30 million yuan, which is the highest record in the province's history. Although the Japanese occupy a part of Zhejiang Province, this remarkable financial achievement is due to agricultural and industrial production, peace and order, and good administration. In the past three years, the agricultural output of most areas in the southeast has doubled compared to the past. In addition to planting the usual grains of the south, farmers, under the guidance of government experts, cultivate wheat, sorghum, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and cotton in mountainous or semi-arid areas, which are more profitable. The output of famous products such as silk from Suzhou and Wuxi and tea from Anhui Province has also increased. The most exciting thing is that farmers automatically sever ties with the Japanese. For example, silkworm farmers in Suzhou and Wuxi are unwilling to sell to the Japanese for 70 yuan per dan, but accept a lower price of 50 yuan to sell to Chinese. The people are willing to work 12 hours a day and enthusiastically support the wartime industrial plan. The income of farmers and workers has increased. Except for the narrow Japanese military stationed in the Qian area, farmers and workers are not disturbed by robbery and extortion. A mutual protection and self-defense system has been implemented in various places, so the local area is peaceful and orderly. Tax collectors are selected from middle school students. What impressed him most was the result of training in various aspects. The women who volunteered to serve in the United States, Britain, and France during the Great War would be ashamed of what Chinese women in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan are doing, because Chinese women are taking over the guarding and construction tasks undertaken by men without hesitation. The training is quite simple, that is, officers train soldiers, and soldiers teach the people what they have learned. The people have received sufficient military training due to their contact with the army. Wartime engineering, cultivation, harvesting, group singing, drama, and discussions are often conducted in cooperation between the military and the people. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Somewhere in Suiyuan West: On the morning of the 11th, the Northern Comfort Mission held a ceremony to present flags and gifts to all the soldiers fighting in Suiyuan West. Tens of thousands of troops and civilians attended. At the foot of the Yin Mountains and on the banks of the Yellow River, the temperature has reached four degrees below zero, but the Chinese officers and soldiers are still wearing short jackets. A deputy commander accepted the flags on behalf of the troops. He Zhonghan delivered a speech, praising the soldiers in Suiyuan West for fighting bloody battles in the freezing cold, guarding the gateway to the Northwest, and preventing the Japanese army from invading further. Pan Xiuren, a representative of the Political Participation Council, spoke, reporting that although the comfort money brought this time was only 5,000 yuan, it was all saved by the people in the rear by cutting back on food and clothing. Every drop was collected and was enough to represent the gratitude and care of the people across the country. A certain deputy commander responded, expressing extreme humility and saying that the national humiliation had not been avenged, and he had no face to accept comfort. However, in recent years, the front-line troops have indeed been able to face death as if it were returning home. After being injured three or five times, they still resolutely refuse to retreat, and remain loyal and brave. In the future, they will further promote this spirit, kill the remaining Japanese, and repay the people of the country. (Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Shantou Foreign Merchants End Business: British and American Missionaries Decide Not to Leave <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the Japanese massively reinforced their troops in Shantou, land and water transportation outside the war zone was completely cut off. Rice is becoming increasingly scarce, and two pounds of broken rice can be purchased for one yuan, but it is still not easy to obtain. There are British and American warships in Shantou Harbor, and the foreigners living outside Jiaoshi rely entirely on the British and American warships for their food. Only one British ship enters the port each week and is not allowed to load any goods ashore, and must leave the port within three hours. In addition, Japanese ships, Guang Sheng Wan and Fujian Wan, run on the Taiwan-Hong Kong line every week. When passing through Shantou, a small number of people with special permits disembark. All letters sent to Hong Kong or other ports must first be stamped and inspected in Taiwan before being sent to the Hong Kong post office. The journey from Shantou to Hong Kong is only one night by water, but ordinary letters take 20 days to reach the recipient. Recently, Chao'an, Anbu, and Chenghai have been attacked by Chinese troops every day. Gunfire can be heard outside the city. Refugees returning home are afraid of local unrest and have fled into Shantou City. The Japanese army suspects them of being plainclothes soldiers and conducts strict searches at various intersections, demanding to see the good citizen certificates and asking where they come from and where they live. In some shops and houses that accommodate too many villagers, the Japanese army often knocks on the door at night to search, and the people cannot live in peace for one night. All foreign firms have sold off their goods and have mostly closed down automatically by the end of October. Only three American drawn-thread companies, out of consideration for the livelihoods of thousands of female workers, are temporarily maintaining the status quo. British and American missionaries in Chaozhou and Meizhou are still living in Jiaoshi and have decided not to leave Shantou in order to maintain the church's work.</p>

<p>Suzhou-Jiaxing Road Suspends Passenger Ticket Sales: Japanese Military Transportation Extremely Busy</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army in this county suddenly notified the railway station on the morning of the 8th that all passenger tickets for the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road stations sold on that day would be refunded, and transportation would be suspended, causing the general public to travel back and forth in vain that day. It is said that the reason for the suspension of passenger ticket sales is that battles have recently occurred between Hangzhou and Huzhou, and the Japanese army is busy with military transportation, so it ordered passenger ticket sales to be suspended. The period of suspension will depend on the war situation.</p>
<p>According to those who fled from Huzhou to Suzhou, the Chinese troops stationed in the suburbs of the city have recently been heavily reinforced and have launched an attack on the city. People living in the city during the day can also hear clear gunfire. The Japanese army has relaxed the restrictions on those leaving the city, but those entering the city are subject to special searches and must also provide information on where they will be staying in the city. It is also said that X0,000 regular Chinese troops have crossed Hangzhou and advanced to Xinshi, Shuanglin, Ling'an, and other places, and the situation is quite favorable. Although the Japanese army has more than 20 troops, including Tamura, Ito, Miyajima, Ishii, Taiqi, Myao, and Morita, they cannot diminish the spirit of the troops in the slightest.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Bishop Yu Bin Discusses the Funeral of Ma Xiangbo: Death in Liangshan After One Year of Illness; Mass Held in Haiphong <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Kunming: Bishop Yu Bin told reporters about Ma Xiangbo's last moments and funeral, saying that Ma was originally from Danyang, Jiangsu, and was a member of the Nanjing Church. He had always been very concerned about Ma. After hearing the bad news in Chongqing, he flew to Liangshan to help with the funeral arrangements. Ma was born on March 19, 1840, which coincided with the start of the foreign troubles. He witnessed how China was bullied by foreign races throughout his life, and his life's work was focused on how to wash away the national shame. His strategy was based on his devout religious beliefs. He advocated education and science, which led to the creation of Aurora University and Fudan University, and the promotion of Fu Jen Catholic University. When the all-out war of resistance broke out, Ma moved to Guilin and planned to move to Kunming, but he was blocked by illness in Liangshan until he died, exactly one year later. Although Ma lived in Vietnam, his heart was always in his motherland. After October 19, the weather in Liangshan suddenly changed, and Ma's temperature rose to 38 degrees. He was treated by a doctor. Although the fever subsided slightly, he was not always lucid. On the night of the 22nd, he could not sleep. On the 25th, his condition worsened, and he asked the priest of Liangshan Church to perform the religious last rites for him. On the 29th, a certain gentleman passed through Liangshan and told him the details of the great victory in northern Hunan. Ma was very excited to hear this and was able to sit up that night and eat a little liquid food. He became overly excited, which led to another sleepless night. On the 3rd of this month, phlegm developed in his throat, and he was unable to vomit. His breathing became weak. At about 9 p.m., he called his family members closer and asked them some questions, but because his strength was too weak, his voice was unclear. Those who were present at the time only heard the vague sound of ("dis... dis... news"). The family then said ("The nation's affairs are being led by the leaders and government officials who are leading the national army and people to fight against the war until victory is achieved"). At that time, Ma could not speak and nodded slightly to signal his understanding. He then fell into a deep sleep. The family asked the doctor to administer medication, but the doctor said that this was a sign of the old man's life force gradually exhausted, and administering medication would only increase his suffering, so he did not administer it. He passed away peacefully at zero hour on the morning of the 4th. He was encoffined on the 5th, and his face looked lifelike. On the 6th, the priest and the assistant priest welcomed the coffin into the church and held a memorial mass. The coffin was sent to the funeral home for temporary placement. When Yu arrived in Liangshan, Ma had already been buried, so he paid his respects to the place where the coffin was placed and prayed for him. Later, the Chinese Consul General in Vietnam initiated a principal service and memorial mass for Ma in Haiphong. Yu went to Haiphong on the 9th. The principal service mass was held on the 10th, and many people attended. He then came to Yunnan via Hanoi. Ma devoted himself to education, and his students and old friends are all over the world. They must be very concerned about the circumstances of Ma's death and funeral, so I am giving you a detailed account. The immortal achievements of Ma in establishing virtue and words, and his great personality, can be summarized by the couplet from President Yu ("Glory returns to God, life and death protect China"), etc. It is said that Bishop Yu can fly back to Chongqing before the 20th.

<h3 id="e46">Unprecedented Grandeur of Charity Football Match: China United and England-France Combined Team Each Score Three Goals, No Winner Decided; 15,000 Fans Crowd the Recreation Ground <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at the Recreation Ground, the China United team played against the England-France combined team in this season's first Sino-Western charity football match. Both sides showcased the essence of Sino-Western football, with beautiful performances that captivated the audience. Spectators scrambled to attend, reaching over 15,000 people, a rare and unprecedented scene. The result of the match saw China United take the lead in the first half with a score of 3-1. However, in the second half, they conceded two goals within a minute, ultimately resulting in a 3-3 draw, with no winner decided. Yesterday's ticket revenue totaled over 10,100 yuan, which will be divided into three parts: one-third will go to Shanghai refugee relief, and one-third each will go to the England and France wartime relief efforts. The lineups of both sides yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>China United Team:</p>
<p>Qin Bi Gao</p>
<p>Chen Hong Guang, Zhuang You Ren</p>
<p>Meng Yi Liang, Li Yi Chen, Jiang Zhao Xiang</p>
<p>Cao Qiu Ting, Wu Qi Xiang, Dai Lin Jing, Jia You Liang</p>
<p>England-France Combined Team:</p>
<p>Bao Sai Zhong</p>
<p>Hai Li Sheng, Ke Lai Tuo</p>
<p>Mai Ke Si Gan, Pan Kui Lai, Xue Ge Lun</p>
<p>Tang Mu Xun, Deng Ken, Sai Te Le, Mai Ke Nai De, Pai Er</p>
<p>Unprecedented Spectacle</p>
<p>Yesterday's scene at the Recreation Ground was a grand spectacle rarely seen in the past two years. Even the visit of the Corinthian football team and last year's charity match were not as impressive. Ticket sales began at noon, and by 2 p.m., the north and south stands were packed with people, leaving no room to move. Even half an hour after the start of the match, many fans were still gathered outside the Recreation Ground, eager to enter. South of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre, various vehicles were completely jammed, and buses and trolley cars moved at a snail's pace. Some people were even selling tickets at the entrance, raising the price of a 1.10 yuan ticket to 1.50 yuan, and even to 2 yuan a few minutes before the start, with no shortage of buyers. The crowded situation at the entrance yesterday and the method of selling and collecting tickets need to be improved. The Westerners' Association is undoubtedly to blame. A group of female customers were complaining loudly, with only a tiny space for two people. The ticket sellers and collectors were incredibly slow. It is necessary to improve this next time.</p>
<p>Glimpses of the Performance</p>
<p>In yesterday's performance, China United's goalkeeper Qin Bi Gao was the most impressive, saving countless shots and being highly praised. However, the center-back line was quite disappointing, especially when the combined team launched fierce counterattacks in the second half. Li Yi Chen's position was too far forward, forgetting the modern football tactic of the third fullback, which left the two fullbacks isolated. Meng Yi Liang and Jiang Zhao Xiang were unable to contain the activity of the two opposing wingers, and the lack of supply made the forwards stall frequently. Sun Tie Tui's absence due to injury was also a slight disadvantage. The combined team's two fullbacks were the most outstanding, with Hai Li Sheng being even better. The two wingers and inside forwards were exceptionally active and dangerous. If it weren't for Bi Gao's heroic saves, they would have surely suffered defeat.</p>
<p>Impressive Momentum</p>
<p>The match did not start until 2:45 p.m. Sun Jin Shun was absent due to injury and was replaced by Wu Qi Xiang. The defensive lineup largely adopted the reporter's suggestions from yesterday. The bureau's attention to this newspaper shows that our views coincide. The combined team kicked off, and Sedler led the attack westward, but was blocked by Zhao Xiang. Qiu Ting penetrated deep, but was also intercepted by Colete. Qiu Ting passed to A-Kui, who handed it to You Liang, and a high kick went out of bounds. Only two minutes into the match, Yi Chen made a long pass, You Liang crossed, and Qi Xiang went straight down, encountered Colete, and at 20 yards, took a flat shot. Bao Sai Zhong rushed out to save, but the ball slipped in from his left armpit, a clear goal. China United took the lead. Five minutes later, Wu Qi Xiang headed the ball at 10 yards. Bao Sai Zhong caught it but slipped, and the ball bounced up. He quickly grabbed it again, but Dai Lin Jing rushed in like a flying eagle, and the ball and Bao rolled into the net together. Two consecutive goals, and the cheers shook the sky. After that, Wu Qi Xiang and Xu Wen Kui exchanged positions.</p>
<p>3-1 Lead</p>
<p>At 16 minutes, You Liang took a corner kick, Qi Xiang headed it, and Bao punched it not far. Xu Wen Kui took a flat shot, but unfortunately, A Dai was unable to return in time, resulting in an offside. It was a pity. Bi Gao made many heroic saves, and everyone praised him. The stalemate lasted until 31 and a half minutes when Pai Er crossed, and Tang Mu Xun took a powerful flat shot at 20 yards. Qin Bi Gao was unable to save it, and it went into the right corner. China United conceded a goal, making it 2-1. At this time, the combined team's offensive intensified, and China United's goal was often in danger. At 37 minutes, Qi Xiang headed the ball, Bao Sai Zhong punched it out, and Qiu Ting passed to the right. A-Kui took a flat shot at 10 yards, and Bao Sai Zhong finally managed to block it, but You Liang rushed into the net like a hawk, 3-1, China United still leading by two goals. At 40 minutes, Bi Gao caught a high pass from Tang Mu Xun, and Sedler jumped up and bumped into it. Although the ball went into the net, it was disallowed due to a foul. Zhuang You Ren kicked the ball out, and the first half ended, it was lemon time.</p>
<p>Forcing a Draw</p>
<p>The second half began with the sound of fighting, and the combined team went all out, their iron cavalry crisscrossing. At three minutes, Pai Er hooked another shot from the baseline. Hong Guang and Bi Gao both missed, and the ball went under Bi Gao's armpit and into the left post. After the center kick-off, the combined team penetrated deep again. Chen Hong Guang was eager to save and accidentally bumped into Pai Er. At 12 yards, Duncan took the penalty and shot it in from under the crossbar. China United conceded two goals within a minute and were tied at 3-3. The overall situation was thus determined. Both sides were evenly matched, and the situation became increasingly tense. At 15 minutes, A-Kui received a long pass from Yi Chen and took a fierce shot at 20 yards, but it was disallowed due to You Liang being offside. Both of A-Kui's shots hit the bullseye but were disallowed due to offside, a great pity. However, the combined team's counterattacks did not slacken. At 25 minutes, Meng Yi Liang's nose was kicked by Pai Er, and blood flowed profusely. He was injured and left the field. A minute later, he returned to the field with an injury. After that, China United's attack was fierce, determined to win, but they ultimately failed and the game ended in a draw.</p>

<p>The second Shanghai Middle School Cup Table Tennis Championship opened at 7 p.m. the night before in the auditorium of the China Middle School on Qipu Road. All the table tennis circles in Shanghai were invited to gather, with over 600 guests attending. First, the chairman of the conference, Yang Yuecai, gave the opening speech, followed by the general secretary, Ding Du, reporting on the preparation process. The competition then began, with Liu Ke Ren and Zhou Bin serving as referees. The first match was between veteran table tennis player Chen Lin Sheng and Shanghai's famous chopping player Zhang Ying. The two players showcased many exciting performances with their alternating strokes and chops. Next was a performance by the women's team. Since the China United women's team did not arrive, the Youth Women's team members were divided into groups for competition. Next was the University League versus the Middle School League. Because the main players of the Middle School League, Fang Xingmin and Hao Guimiao, had been promoted to university, their strength was greatly affected, resulting in a crushing defeat of 1-4. Finally, famous table tennis players performed, with the matches between Li An and Jian Yu Shu, and Ye Mao Zhi and Zhang Zhi Hong being the most exciting.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Food: Rice Becomes a Speculative Commodity <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>—How Can the People's Food Be Anything But Difficult?—</p>
<p>After a brief turnaround in the rice market in the last two days, yesterday the rising trend became even more intense. This is because various merchants could not agree with the Shanghai market, and the supply was very tight, lacking shipments for a long time. Unexpectedly, the old habits of some hoarders returned, taking advantage of the lack of goods to launch a large-scale operation, speculating and manipulating the market. The situation was chaotic for a time, and the merchants from other provinces started shouting. Even the local merchants saw this favorable situation and quickly followed suit, enthusiastically competing to purchase. Regardless of japonica or indica rice, everything was eagerly bought up, so the prices of various goods rose all the way, becoming more and more intense. For example, even though the amount of Dumi and Sheyang indica rice arriving from the lower reaches of the river to the Nangang Songjiang area was 12 or 13 shipments, and over 20 truckloads, numbering 2,500 or 2,600 bags, arrived by train from the Changshu Jiading Qingpu Songjiang Fengxian Lianhe area, as a result, the prices of both japonica and indica rice rose by about one yuan compared to the previous market. The price of special Changshu japonica rice has been set at 32 yuan, Kuntai high-quality japonica rice has also been set at 30 yuan, Qingjiao kiln green medium rice at 29.23 yuan, lower quality at 28 yuan, special Lujian indica rice at 28.5 yuan, special Sheyang indica rice at 28 yuan, Jiangbei indica rice and Jingwu indica rice at 27.5 yuan, Chenyuan at 31 yuan, and Xinyuan at 30 yuan. The number of transactions was over 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>The price of customer indica rice became more and more sharp yesterday. In addition to the continued support from customer merchants, hoarders inside and outside the industry became even more active. Although some hoarders changed to buying japonica rice, they were still tempted by rumors and continued to buy customer indica rice. However, the customer indica rice had reached its lowest point and the supply was lacking for a long time, so those who manipulated the market seized the opportunity to monopolize it. The price was most evident in the morning, and the selling price was shouted higher and higher. Wuhu indica rice reached 27.5 yuan, and Jiangbei indica rice also exceeded 27 yuan, an increase of 1.35 yuan compared to the previous market. However, after the price rose, the actual sales of this customer have stopped. Although the Japanese merchants have not fully sold out, the source, in addition to some scattered households, is 13,000 bags of Wuhu indica rice newly arrived from the Japanese merchants yesterday. Therefore, the nervousness of the people in the industry has also eased, and the market price will have to be secretly cut by 0.35 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Arrives, Yarn Market Fluctuates <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market yesterday was generally stable due to the closure of all banks, which led to the suspension of business. However, the sales channels for various merchants remained narrow. The market is in a state of fluctuation in the short term. If the foreign exchange rate is allowed to lengthen, or there is a small change, otherwise we must wait for actual sales to promote and reappear a new posture.</p>
<p>The cotton market situation has recently become more stable. This is because overseas European and American cotton markets have risen in unison, leading to a step up in people's sentiment. Fortunately, the exchange rate has lengthened again, and in addition, the source from northern Jiangsu is constantly arriving, which can still be leveled out.

<p>Yesterday, 2,480 bags of cotton arrived from Beisha, and 75 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Soars by Two Yuan <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The price of soybean oil soared by two yuan yesterday. Before the opening of the market in the morning, there was a tense situation. This was caused by the manipulators spreading rumors, and there were also rumors that the source was blocked. This caused a commotion to discard the cheap and buy again, and some wind-stirring and wave-making people also helped to fuel the soaring wind. However, in the face of the recent reduction in arrivals, the people's sentiment cannot help but have this effect. Therefore, the price of Jiaozhou oil, because the arrival and inventory are still available, was slightly loose, and the market price only rose by 1.2 yuan, and in the afternoon it still maintained the original market in the morning, with the price opening at 50 yuan. A total of 500 pieces were transacted. Another 100 pieces of Qingqi oil were opened (price details in the market price column), 200 pieces of Yanqi oil, and 30 barrels of Kobe oil, 20 barrels of Qingdao oil, 500 cans of "road goods" Jiangbei canned oil, and 30 cans of Baiwen oil. Peanut oil was not sold to Hong Kong, and only those from this street and Shantou asked about it, and the market price rose slightly by 0.5 yuan. Jiaozhou oil was opened for 100 pieces, and Jiangbei canned oil for 200 cans.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 890 18-can packs of raw oil came from Yantai, and 150 bags of beans came from Beisha. Today's exports include 1,300 cans of raw oil to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The sugar market eased slightly yesterday due to the lack of actual sales. The public meeting price of No. 24 coarse white was 52.5 yuan in the local warehouse and 53.5 yuan in the foreign warehouse. The old goods were 52.5 yuan. The transshipment goods were a small profit of 70 cents, at 42.8 yuan. The Taikoo White was a small profit of 50 cents, the warehouse B mark was 56 yuan, the West warehouse was 56.5 yuan, the CW mark was 56 yuan, the CX mark was 55 yuan, the DY Kark was 54 yuan, and the HX mark was 53.5 yuan. The H mark cart red oil-wrapped goods were 39 yuan, the white-wrapped goods were 40 yuan, and the Dutch red was 42 yuan. The price of local cotton white was a small profit of 50 cents, No. 1 was 52.5 yuan, No. 2 was 52 yuan, No. 3 was 51.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 51 yuan. There was no reaction to local crystal sugar, and no price was opened for national sugar. A batch of Diaoqing arrived by Japanese ship, totaling 195 bags, 485 bags came from Beihai on the 13th, 80 bags from Haikou, and 70 bags from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Piece Goods: Grass Yellow Woolen Fabrics are Firm <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Grass yellow and grass green woolen fabrics, such as thick and thin serge, Walterine, riding breeches, uniform cloth, military uniforms and leg wraps, etc., have recently been in demand by inland customers and those from Nanjing. Those on this street who specialize in large orders also need them. The shipments to Sichuan and Zhejiang are numerous. The market prices per yard are all one or two corners higher than usual. However, compared with the actual sales before the Republic of China 26, they have decreased by two-thirds. However, there is a large shortage of domestic products in recent years, which makes the supply and demand still balanced, so they can still rise. The output of Dalong Sheep City brand is slightly sufficient, so buyers often specify it. The opening price of No. 128 serge is 6.1 yuan per yard, No. 258 Walterine is 8.1 yuan, and the final price is Dakangming Amitabha. Grass yellow sells for 6 yuan, Yuan Canghui for 5.85 yuan, and Yihuo Yinfeng yellow riding breeches for 10.05 yuan. Zhanghua and Xiexin are both out of stock on the market. Polish-made military uniform yellow cloth is generally sold for 8.25 yuan, and the final price of the leg wrap yellow cloth is a net price of 6 yuan.</p>

<p>Walnuts have continued to be tight in the market recently due to few arrivals. A batch of Haozhou goods was opened, with a price of 62 yuan, up another 4.5 yuan compared to before. There was no significant change in walnut meat, and the opening price of Jinan goods was 135 yuan.</p>

<p>The business of cooked coal rose due to the repeated increase in the price of coal balls. However, recently, the business of cooked coal has been slack due to the establishment of a certain factory and competitive dumping of coal balls, and has had to fall accordingly, with the market price falling by five or six yuan per ton. The retail price of the stores on this street is 3.8 yuan per load for large pieces of cooked coal, and 3.4 yuan for small pieces, delivered to customers without charging delivery fees.</p>

<h3 id="e62">From Fractional Currency to One Dollar Bills <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>The first batch of fractional currency notes has been issued for a long time, but the change received when buying things is still mostly in the form of tram tickets or stamps, or cigarette cards or automobile company two- or three-cent coins with their values marked on them. The various types of voucher notes that used to circulate in large quantities have indeed decreased significantly. What the fractional currency notes have filled in is approximately a portion of the gap left by the various voucher notes. Although the second batch of fractional currency notes also amounts to 500,000, the demand in society is too great, and since it is difficult to prevent fractional currency notes from continuing to flow to the mainland, and many citizens inevitably collect and redeem them for fun, five-cent and ten-cent notes are saved up. Therefore, in reality, they are still likely to be insufficient for circulation. According to a report in this newspaper on the 11th of this month, the Central Bank's distribution of the second batch of fractional currency notes generally stipulates that each business can exchange 20 yuan. A mere 20 yuan is not enough for a large store's change for a day. For small stores, if they are willing to give it out as much as possible, it definitely won't last half a month.</p>
<p>The lack of fractional currency is not unique to Shanghai; it has become a widespread phenomenon. Currently, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, as well as Lanzhou, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Changshu, Kunshan, and other places are all experiencing a copper coin panic. Larger merchants in those areas, because local post offices cannot purchase large amounts of stamps, bring several to dozens of yuan worth of stamps back from Shanghai each time for use as small change. In Shanghai, people don't want stamps unless they are brand new, but in the countryside, even slightly damaged stamps are accepted, which shows that the suffering of the people in the occupied areas is deepening. (Note that copper coins are still used in areas north of the Yangtze River under the rule of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which shows where the copper coins from the occupied areas have gone.)</p>
<p>Many stores, out of business needs, have no choice but to purchase several yuan worth of stamps from the post office every day for change, otherwise they will be unable to maintain their operations. There are even more stores in the Central District of the International Settlement that use stamps as small change. According to rumors, the stores that give out between 30 and 50 yuan worth of brand-new stamps every day include Guanshengyuan, Wing On Company's Tianyunlou, Hu Qing Yu Tang, and Xue Ji, among others. Those that give out around 10 yuan worth of new stamps every day include Wufuzhai, Xinya Hotel, Huizhong Hotel, Sino-French Pharmacy, Shilu Fengtai, Liang Lianji Restaurant, and Dasanyuan Restaurant. Those that give out around 5 yuan worth of new stamps every day include Taoyuan Restaurant, Quanxingkang, Dasamsung, Yanhualou, Huimanji, Qingyise Restaurant, Xin'an Company, Yu Yonghe Silver Shop, Shurentang, Darentang, Zhengjia Muqiao Afu Pavilion, Hehexing Rib Noodles, and Daguangming Cinema, among others. In addition, those that buy new stamps for one or two yuan or more per day include Qutainbao, One-Corner Store, Xiangya Company, China National Products Company, Little Luzon, Nanyang Socks Factory, Nanhua Socks Factory, Huahua Socks Factory, Wang Sanhe Restaurant, Fulu Shou, Ruikang Watch Shop, Yongyuan Hardware Store, Hu Kaiwen, Guangrongtai Hardware Store, and several pawnshops and sauce shops, the number of which is countless. Of course, the numbers of stamps mentioned above fluctuate from time to time. This is just a comparison based on hearsay!</p>
<p>The problem of fractional currency has not been completely resolved, and the phenomenon of a shortage of one-dollar bills and corner notes on the market has occurred again. Among the corner notes, one-corner bills are particularly scarce. In recent days, it has often been seen that many cigarette shops and some busy hotels and businesses are searching everywhere for one-dollar bills and single and double corner notes, causing the premium on corner notes to rise to between 10 and 15 yuan per thousand. Now that the end of the year is approaching, if this phenomenon continues and cannot be corrected, the future is extremely worrying. The reason for the shortage of corner notes and one-dollar bills is nothing more than two reasons: one is that there are no financial regulatory bank organizations in the occupied areas, and all the single notes and corner notes in Shanghai are being taken away in large quantities by various merchants; the other is that it is obvious that someone is manipulating them for profit. This problem is neither big nor small. Currently, it is still in its early stages. If it becomes more serious day by day, and the disease worsens and breaks out, it is very likely that the corner notes and one-dollar bills on the market will suddenly disappear without a trace, just like the copper coins before. The suffering at that time would be even deeper than the fractional currency panic, so I hope everyone in society pays attention to it. This is still just a precaution!</p>

<h3 id="e63">British Troop Adjustment in North China Unrelated to Far East Policy, By No Means a Preliminary Abandonment of Interests in North China, Japanese Interpretation Entirely One-Sided <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, according to foreign news agencies in London and Amsterdam, the British War Office announced that the government had decided to withdraw British troops stationed in North China, leaving only a few necessary troops to protect the safety and property of British citizens and maintain order. Chinese and foreign figures in Shanghai paid close attention to the news of the withdrawal of British troops from North China because at the beginning of the outbreak of the European war, the Japanese government, on the grounds of its "non-interference" in the European war, requested that the countries participating in the European war withdraw their troops stationed in the areas occupied by the Japanese army in China. Moreover, foreign observers here also believe that one of the two battalions of the British Defense Force currently stationed in Shanghai may also be withdrawn, and rumors from the outside world have become increasingly confusing.</p>
<p>Shanghai Not Affected</p>
<p>Last night, it was learned from reliable sources that the British military headquarters in Shanghai had not received any official notification regarding the British government's decision to withdraw British troops from North China. The British government's decision mentioned in various telegrams all clearly stated North China and did not involve other places. Therefore, the interpretation here is that Shanghai will not be affected. As for the Japanese side's observation, it is believed that this decision by the British is the initial action to finally abandon all interests in North China. British business circles here expressed doubts. According to a British tycoon in Shanghai and a member of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, he told reporters that those who believe that Britain will abandon its interests in North China can be called a "foolish prophecy."</p>
<p>London Telegram, Withdrawal of Some Troops</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that a telegram from London today (the 13th) announced that the British War Office had decided to withdraw some of the British troops stationed in North China. Observers in this city believe that this news means that one of the two British battalions stationed in Shanghai will be withdrawn, leaving two British battalions stationed in Tianjin and Shanghai. The British troops stationed in North China, in addition to the auxiliary team, also have three major teams: the Bao Han Light Infantry Team stationed in Tianjin, the West Fu Zi Highlands Team and the Dong Xu Lai Team stationed in Shanghai. It has been several years since the British army stationed in Shanghai had only one battalion. However, in the event of an accident, British troops are transferred from other areas to Shanghai for reinforcement, reaching three battalions. Currently, the Dong Xu Lai Team was originally stationed in Shanghai, while the West Fu Zi Team was transferred from Hong Kong to Shanghai. If the current war had not broken out, the West Fu Zi Team would now be replaced by the Highlands Light Infantry Team, and the one that is about to withdraw from Shanghai may be the West Fu Zi Team. However, no detailed report has yet been obtained from the British military headquarters in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Expresses Unique Views</p>
<p>The spokesman for the Japanese Army in Shanghai stated at the press conference last night in response to reporters' inquiries, "The British withdrawal of its troops stationed in North China is obviously because they believe that the lives and property of British nationals in that area can be protected by the Japanese Army." The reporter asked, "According to a telegram from Amsterdam, this move by the British is the result of Japanese pressure. What is your opinion?" He replied, "I do not believe that it is affected by any pressure." The spokesman for the Japanese Embassy continued to state, completely agreeing with this view, and said, "I believe that if the British government did not fully trust that the lives, property, and interests of British nationals could be safely guaranteed by the Japanese army, it would not have taken this step even if the European war broke out." The reporter asked, "Will this move by the British government promote the relationship between Britain and Japan in North China?" He replied, "This is not directly related to the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin, but the resolution of various local pending issues in Tianjin will help solve part of the blockade problem." The spokesman for the Japanese Embassy continued, "According to my personal belief, the Tianjin British Concession issue can be resolved soon, but no one can predict how the future situation will encounter."</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association handled the issuance of inter-bank remittances for member banks and firms, each bank and firm provided collateral and applied to the Joint Bank Reserve Committee for issuance to the market, which is convenient for all industries. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Bankers' Association, and the Banking and Money Industry Association jointly formed a Remittance Reserve Inspection Committee to conduct inspections to demonstrate great trust. As of the end of September, the total appraised value of inter-bank remittance collateral deposited by various banks and firms was 39,728,680 yuan and 3 jiao. The total amount of inter-bank remittances approved for issuance was 23,063,000 yuan. Regarding the deposit of inter-bank remittance collateral by various banks and firms as of the end of October, the Inspection Committee Chairman Xu Jilou has sent personnel to start the inspection, which is expected to be completed within this week. The fourth meeting of the Inspection Committee will be held at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, the 20th of this month, and the inspection report will be announced after it is approved.</p>
<h3 id="e65">A Young Man Assassinated at the Intersection of East Zilaihuo Street Last Night, The Deceased Shao Fanjiu Was a Lawyer's Assistant, Rumored to Have Some Relationship with a Certain Organization <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>At around 8 o'clock last night, a shooting occurred at the intersection of East Zilaihuo Street and Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. A young man was shot four times and died immediately. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Gunshots Erupt, Young Man Falls to the Ground</p>
<p>At 8:35 last night, four consecutive gunshots suddenly erupted at the entrance of the Xixing Hotel at No. 377 East Zilaihuo Street (i.e., the intersection of Avenue Edward VII) in the French Concession. At that time, four or five Chinese and Russian detectives from the French Concession were checking pedestrians at the Dahud Hotel, which was less than a hundred yards to the east. When they heard the gunshots, they rushed to the scene and saw a young man had fallen to the ground in response.</p>
<p>Young Man Standing Aside, Panicked</p>
<p>The young man was about thirty years old, wearing a black Zhongshan suit, with his head facing west and his feet facing east, lying in the middle of the road in front of the Xixing Hotel. A total of four shots hit his head and waist. There was also a young man of about twenty years old wearing a khaki-colored suit standing aside, looking stunned. At that time, the Chinese and Russian detectives split up to pursue, but it was too late, and the murderer had already escaped without a trace. The detectives immediately reported to the police station and sent detectives to investigate.</p>
<p>The Injured Dies, Named Shao Fanjiu</p>
<p>However, by the time the detectives from the police station arrived, the injured man had already died. They then took the young man in the suit standing aside to the police station and took the body to the morgue for examination. It was reported that the young man in the suit claimed that the deceased was named Shao Fanjiu, a local, over thirty years old, and currently working as an assistant at Chen Jipeng's law firm, residing at No. 5 Jiande Village, Xuzhen Road, Xujiahui.</p>
<p>Dinner Together, Neighboring Table Spying</p>
<p>The young man continued, "He and the deceased were good friends. Tonight (last night) at around 7 o'clock, he, the deceased, and a friend went to the Lao Guangdong Restaurant at No. 363 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession for dinner. After eating, they went out together and were walking east when they arrived at the intersection of East Zilaihuo Street, when a thug rushed up and fired four shots at the deceased, all hitting vital points." However, when they were dining at Lao Guangdong, there were four people in suits at the neighboring table. When the three of them left the restaurant, the four people at the neighboring table also followed them out.</p>
<p>Cause of Death, Politically Related</p>
<p>After the incident, according to rumors, the deceased's maternal uncle was named Tao Yishan, who is now working in Chongqing, while the deceased, Shao Fanjiu, is now working for an organization in Shanghai. This sudden misfortune may be related to politics.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the fall of Songhu and Chongqing. The people of Shanghai unanimously commemorated it with grief. Patriotic leaflets were found everywhere. The concession authorities implemented the usual precautions. The whole day passed peacefully in a calm and solemn atmosphere. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Patriotic Leaflets Found Everywhere</p>
<p>Yesterday, patriotic leaflets were found in Daxin Street, Avenue Edward VII, and other places, posted on utility poles. The names on them were the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League and the Jiangnan Guerrilla Force of the Loyal National Salvation Army, etc. The content was a letter to the citizens of the isolated island, saying that due to the special environment since the fall of the isolated island, this sacred anniversary cannot be commemorated in form. However, we cannot forget it because of this. We should be diligent and self-motivated, unite as one, support the central government's national policy, overthrow traitorous acts, not seek peace, not compromise, implement the National Covenant, and strive to achieve the goal of winning the war and building the country.</p>
<p>Concession Precautions, All Day Peaceful</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions, considering that yesterday was the anniversary of the fall of Songhu and Chongqing, continued to implement the usual precautions. Patrolmen were added to all roads, patrolling back and forth and searching pedestrians. The French Concession also dispatched armored vehicles to guard each road and implement security. The whole day passed peacefully in a calm and solemn atmosphere. In addition, the Japanese side took strict precautions yesterday. Japanese troops and puppet police were added to Pudong, Zhabei, Nanshi, and the suburbs. The bridges along the Suzhou River were especially heavily guarded. Pedestrians were subjected to harsh searches.</p>

<p>New Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai on Italian Mail Ship, Mail Ships to Europe Scheduled to Depart</p>
<p>The fast Italian Mail Company Euro-Asia route mail ships Conte Verde and Conte Rosso, after returning from Shanghai to Venice between June and July of this year, entered the dry dock for repairs. After the work was completed, they were about to resume sailing, but suddenly the European war broke out. At that time, because the Italian government's attitude was unclear, they were notified to continue to suspend sailing. In the middle of last month, after the Italian government's attitude was clarified, the company resumed the sailing of the two ships. The Conte Verde first departed from Venice on the 17th of last month and arrived in Shanghai via the original route. It is scheduled to enter the port at 2:00 p.m. today and dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. The ship has 364 passengers, including an Italian army team of about 110 people, who are said to be relieving a certain Italian army team stationed in this city. In addition to the Italian army sending a small transport to greet them, the passengers will be landed at the Customs House Wharf by the company's prepared passenger ferries at about 3:30 p.m. today. The large ship will stay in Shanghai for three days and is scheduled to return to Europe from Shanghai on the 17th. The Conte Rosso has also departed and is en route, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. In addition, the British Company's Euro-Asia route mail ship Puteng arrived in Shanghai on the 16th of last month and went to Japan on the 18th. It has now returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 12th) and is docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. After loading cargo in Shanghai, it is scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning and return to London. The Sumanli arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month and is also docked at the Gongchang Wharf in Pudong, without going to Japan. It is still staying in Shanghai. It is said that it will have to return to Europe on the 24th. The new steamship Yizhizhajiaga of the Java Mail Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Surabaya via Nanyang and Hong Kong and Xiamen, and entered the port at 2:40 p.m., docking at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. The ship had more than 440 passengers on this trip to Shanghai. After arriving at the port, they changed to the company's prepared passenger ferries and landed at the Customs House Wharf at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. The mail ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Xiamen and Hong Kong on the 16th, and return to Surabaya via the original route through Nanyang.</p>

<h3 id="e70">The Puppet Government's Proposed Counter-Proposal for Western Shanghai, The Municipal Council Is Seriously Considering It in Part, First the British and American Directors Will Study the Content, Formal Reply Will Take More Than a Week <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the negotiation of road construction beyond the border, the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiaowan visited Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, at 5:30 p.m. on the 11th and submitted a "counter-proposal." As for the content, due to the agreement between the two parties to strictly maintain secrecy, it will not be published for the time being. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, who said that the Municipal Council will decide its attitude after the Municipal Council holds a meeting regarding the "counter-proposal" submitted by the puppet mayor. Mr. Fessenden refused to make any statement on the "counter-proposal" submitted by Chuan Xiaowan other than making this statement. Mr. Fessenden only said that he could not make any comments on the content of Mr. Chuan's "counter-proposal" at the moment because both parties hope that an agreement can be reached on the issue of road construction beyond the border as soon as possible. General speculation is that the Municipal Council will convene a meeting of directors to discuss it. According to reliable sources obtained by a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the "meeting" mentioned by Mr. Fessenden refers to an informal meeting between the British and American countries. The Municipal Council has decided to submit the puppet municipal government's counter-proposal to the British and American directors for research first, and then convene a meeting of the directors of the two countries before deciding on the attitude to take. Therefore, the Municipal Council's reply to the "counter-proposal" will take at least a week before it can be sent out.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Sub-Bureau Moves to Border Area</p>
<p>The huge building at No. 11 Jisi Feiai Road (Avenue Haig), originally the Sheng Family Ancestral Hall, was borrowed by the Cilian Branch after the August 13th Shanghai War and used as the site of the 31st Refugee Shelter. A large number of refugees lived there. On the afternoon of September 9, it was suddenly invaded by Japanese and puppet military police, who occupied the staff room on the ground floor of the shelter and two large rooms of the refugee dormitory for use as puppet police offices and set up sentry posts and defensive works at the entrance. However, the refugees in the shelter still lived in a part of the building, and the two bamboo huts built on the open space in the building as the school buildings for the children's middle school were still maintained as usual. This situation was maintained for nearly two months. Recently, the puppet police forced all the refugees out of the shelter, and the children's middle school was also forced to close and announced its dissolution. Until yesterday, the "Shanghai West Police Sub-Bureau" of the puppet "Municipal Government Police Bureau" officially moved from its original address at No. 2 Kaina Road to No. 11 Jisi Feiai Road. General observation is that the relocation of the Shanghai West Puppet Police Station to the above-mentioned new address has its own important significance. It is because that place is adjacent to the concession area and is at the throat of road construction beyond the border. At a time when negotiations on the issue of road construction beyond the border are underway, its actions are even more worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Armed Chinese Not Yet Released</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that sixteen armed Chinese in military uniform who were arrested by British soldiers on Sunday were still being detained by the British army because no one came to claim them. The British army could not find their master. It is reported that these people encountered a British army patrol at the intersection of Triumph Road and Baireinan Road at 7:00 a.m. on Sunday and were arrested because they were carrying rifles, pistols, and even hand grenades and walking along the concession road. These people were wearing the green uniforms of the "Self-Defense Group" of the "Reformed Nationalist Party," which are different from the uniforms of the Great Road Police. The "Self-Defense Group" to which they belong is one of the many groups currently in western Shanghai. The hometown of these sixteen people is not Shanghai. According to one of them, they are from inland Pudong. The British army is now detaining them and providing them with food, waiting for their master to come and claim them.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Beat Up, Car Ticket Check</p>
<p>At 1:20 p.m. yesterday, a public bus of the China Public Bus Company was traveling from east to west along Avenue Haig. A Chinese passenger on the bus refused to buy a ticket, showed the ticket seller his so-called "badge," and even claimed, "I have never bought a ticket when taking a public bus. One day I will be the boss of the company." The company's Russian ticket checker No. 36 intervened. At that time, when the vehicle drove to the opposite side of the Diamond Shop in Dairmond, the passenger summoned the puppet police who had invaded the guard post on the road built beyond the border, dragged the Russian ticket checker down and beat him up, and used the butt of a rifle to destroy the edge of the public bus.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Released Portuguese Ships, Portuguese Consulate No Longer Protects, Registration Certificates of Each Ship Canceled, Content Extremely Complicated, Still Problems <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese naval authorities have detained more than ten Portuguese merchant ships since April 8th of this year. After repeated unsuccessful negotiations by the Portuguese Consulate, the Portuguese merchants' Atlantic Hailong and the gasoline sailboat Lude · Baode · Dade, as well as seven ships of the Huamei Shipping Company, Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, and Tang Bei, were actually claimed by someone posing as the shipowner, admitting that each ship belonged to Chinese merchants and willing to register with the puppet "Shipping Bureau," so they were returned by the Japanese naval authorities one after another. However, each shipping company had not contacted them in advance. After inquiring with Portugal, they learned the inside story. According to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency who learned from the shipping industry, the Portuguese Consulate stated that because the released Portuguese ships had been admitted to be owned by Chinese merchants and registered with the puppet "Shipping Bureau," the registration of each ship had been canceled, and the Portuguese Consulate would no longer be responsible for the protection of everything related to the ships in the future. According to another reporter from the Da Guang News Agency, after the three Portuguese ships Tang Lu, Tang Qiao, and Tang Bei, which were represented by the American firm Huamei Shipping Company, were returned by the Japanese side on the 4th of this month, the person claiming to be the shipowner's representative actually planned to form a new company and continue to operate. All the employees who had been sent by the company to watch the ship were driven ashore and new workers were recruited to board the ship. However, the Huamei Shipping Company, due to the relationship of the deposit, decided to deal with it through legal procedures. Therefore, the content of each ship is complicated, and whether it can set sail is still a major issue.</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Improving Trend of Foreign Trade: Customs Statistics Confirm Widespread Increase in Exports of Local Products, and Reduction in Tianjin Customs' Imports <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>After adjustments, China's foreign trade has seen a surge in exports, a sharp decrease in imports, and a reduction in trade deficits. The Trade Commission's full efforts to promote the export of local products have shielded it from the effects of the Sino-Japanese War and the outbreak of the European War. As a result, foreign exchange reserves are increasing, and the black market value of the legal tender is soaring. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>**Significant Increase in Exports of Chinese Local Products**</p>
<p>Regarding the export of local products, the figures for the first, second, and third quarters of this year were 67,778,769 yuan, an increase of 11,789,2022 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to the United States amounted to 12,266,600 yuan, an increase of 6,344,800 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to Hong Kong amounted to 15,170,090 yuan, a decrease of 3,771,100 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to Japan amounted to 4,763,200 yuan, a decrease of 4,327,300 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to the United Kingdom amounted to 6,369,800 yuan, an increase of 2,389,900 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to Annam amounted to 4,460,020 yuan, an increase of 3,374,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to France amounted to 2,562,800 yuan, an increase of 1,133,700 yuan compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>**Decline in Dumping of Japanese Goods**</p>
<p>Regarding the import of foreign goods, after the Ministry of Finance issued measures to prohibit the import of goods, all luxury and non-essential items were not allowed to be imported or re-exported to non-occupied areas. The import of foreign goods in the first, second, and third quarters of this year was 100,617,315.64 yuan. Although this was an increase compared to the same period last year, it was due to the dumping of Japanese goods in the occupied areas. For example, imports of Japanese goods amounted to 24,553,000 yuan, an increase of 11,633,400 yuan compared to the same period last year. The total value of foreign goods imported from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France was 23,060,010 yuan, a decrease of 3,764,300 yuan compared to the same period last year. However, since September of this year, the import of foreign goods has sharply decreased to 93,781,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,661,000 yuan compared to August, and a decrease of 2,309,300 yuan compared to July. This is due to the government's prohibition of the import of foreign goods.</p>
<p>**Trade Improvement: A Comparison of Past and Present**</p>
<p>After the improvement of foreign trade, all customs in non-occupied areas, such as Mengzi, Simao, Tengyue, Longzhou, Beihai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Wuzhou, have shifted to trade surpluses. In the first, second, and third quarters of this year, twelve customs collectively had a trade surplus of 51,947,000 yuan. The customs with trade deficits included Shanghai, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Jiaozhou, Longkou, and Weihaiwei, with Shanghai, Tianjin, and Jiaozhou having the largest deficits. Although the government has made every effort to eliminate trade deficits, it is generally due to the occupation of these areas, which limits the government's power. The import of Japanese goods through these customs and their dumping in the occupied areas cannot be prohibited. However, since September, the Shanghai customs, which had previously held the top position in trade deficits, suddenly shifted to a trade surplus, with a surplus of 17,374,353 yuan. The trade deficit in Tianjin customs has also decreased from 22,738,000 yuan in August to 10,118,000 yuan. This confirms that China's foreign trade has indeed improved.</p>

<p>**Japanese Casualties Being Transported to Shanghai Yesterday; Japanese Military's Actions Show Obvious Tension**</p>
<p>Since the Chinese guerrilla forces launched attacks in the Longhua and Xinzhuang areas, the fighting has been extremely fierce. Large numbers of Japanese troops from Shanghai and Songjiang have been dispatched to reinforce the area. Artillery battles are still ongoing every night. Yesterday morning, around 8:30 AM, three Japanese Red Cross ambulances drove along the highway from the southern city to the area. Around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, two trucks carrying dead and wounded Japanese soldiers, covered with white tarpaulins and estimated to hold sixty or seventy people, passed through Min'guo Road to the 16th Pier and were transferred to small boats for transport to rear hospitals in Hongkou for treatment.</p>
<p>**Japanese Troops Forcibly Conscripting Laborers in Hongkou**</p>
<p>Due to the emergency on various front lines, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in Hongkou have reinforced the front lines. According to a person in Hongkou speaking to a Dagong News Agency reporter yesterday, the Japanese troops in Hongkou conscripted laborers on the two days prior to transport military supplies for the Japanese army or directly escort them to various occupied areas, reaching over six hundred people. These conscripted Chinese people were all poorly dressed, impoverished workers or passersby. Regardless of whether they had permits or were residents of Hongkou, they were forcibly taken away. No one knows where they were being sent to.</p>
<p>**Japanese Military Strengthening Security at Floating Restaurant**</p>
<p>The floating restaurant near the Bund Park in the Huangpu River has been occupied by a team dispatched by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters since the withdrawal of the national army to the west. The Japanese army considers suspected criminals both north and south of the Huangpu River, and escorts them to the team for interrogation. Yesterday, the Japanese military police at the location even added two or three sentries outside the restaurant, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, pacing back and forth. Pedestrians have disappeared along the Bund, and passage is prohibited at night. It is heard that many people were arrested by the Japanese army from ships and boats and taken to the restaurant for questioning yesterday.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, the Netherlands has declared strict neutrality. However, the recent stalemate on the Western Front has led Germany to demand the establishment of an air force base on the Dutch North Sea coast to be closer to London and facilitate German air force operations. However, this demand has been rejected by the Dutch government. As a result, German troops have recently concentrated in large numbers on the Dutch border, attempting to undermine the country's neutrality. In preparation for any eventuality, the Netherlands is now actively deploying defenses. Relations between the Netherlands and Germany have reached a state of extreme tension. According to confirmed information obtained by a Dagong News Agency reporter from the banking sector, when the European War broke out, German merchants who had savings in British banks such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank rushed to withdraw their funds and deposit them in the Dutch-owned Hollandsche Bank aan de Zuidafrikaansche Republiek, located in the Sassoon House on the Bund, totaling approximately 2 million yuan. Since the deterioration of relations between the Netherlands and Germany, German僑s suddenly rushed to withdraw their deposits from the Hollandsche Bank on the 11th, with withdrawals totaling 1.5 million yuan in one day. It is heard that the German僑s acted on instructions from the German Consulate in Shanghai, suggesting that Germany's determination to invade the Netherlands is imminent.</p>

<p>Wu Jiduan, a native of Wuxi, owner of the United Iron Works at 130, Lane 87, Connaught Road, Public Concession, is 40 years old this year. Through a matchmaker, he married Chen Guiying, a fellow villager (31 years old this year), at Jitae Restaurant in Wuxi. They have been married for nine years, and the relationship between the couple was relatively harmonious. In recent years, however, Wu has become entangled in an inextricable relationship with his niece, leading to</p>
<p>**Discord Between Husband and Wife**</p>
<p>Recently, Chen Guiying hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Li Gengxiang, Yang Yunshi, and Ge Bangren to file a civil lawsuit petitioning for divorce. The petition stated that the plaintiff, Chen Guiying, married the defendant, Wu Jiduan, on July 24, 1931, through a matchmaker, and they had a son and a daughter. The son's name is Dongping, nine years old this year, and the daughter's name is Xiaoying, seven years old this year. The relationship between the couple was initially harmonious, but who would have known that the defendant's attitude suddenly changed, and he began to</p>
<p>**Subject the Plaintiff to Abuse**</p>
<p>On July 25 of this year, the defendant suddenly injured the plaintiff all over her body, which was reported to the police station. The plaintiff, considering the future happiness of her children, did not want to pursue the matter deeply, hoping that the defendant would repent and their good dream could be restored. However, the defendant not only did not repent but became even worse, even refusing to provide food and driving her out of the house. Now the plaintiff has discovered that the defendant is</p>
<p>**Having an Affair with His Niece**</p>
<p>and has evidence to prove it. Only then did she realize the reason for being resented. Such immoral and scandalous behavior has completely severed their relationship. As for the children they had, the defendant, who does not restrain himself, should, for the benefit of the children, be placed in the plaintiff's custody and care. The expenses for their marriage and education are estimated to be 1,000 yuan each. The defendant should also be responsible for paying. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1052, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Code, the proviso in the latter part of Article 1051 of the same law, and Article 1056 of the same law, the plaintiff petitions the court to swiftly</p>
<p>**Issue a Summons for Questioning**</p>
<p>and rule (1) that the divorce between the two parties be granted, (2) that the defendant should pay the plaintiff alimony of 6,000 yuan, (3) that the children be placed in the plaintiff's custody, (4) that the plaintiff should pay the children's education expenses of 1,000 yuan each, (5) that the litigation costs be borne by the defendant, etc. Upon receiving the petition, the court, yesterday, instructed Judge Gui Yu to convene the third court for questioning. The plaintiff was represented by lawyers Yang Yunshi and Ge Bangren, who stated the intent of the lawsuit. The defendant, Wu Jiduan, claimed that he and the plaintiff were cohabiting and opposed the divorce, saying that the plaintiff fabricated the facts and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court verified the statements and decided to reschedule the hearing and summon the matchmaker to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Tragic Incident in the Huangpu River Yesterday Morning; Japanese Motorboat Violently Collides with Ferry; Over Sixty People Drowned; More Than Thirty Male and Female Bodies Retrieved <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>There was a ferry crossing with civilian ferries at the Lingjia Mu Bridge ferry in the west of Yangjing Town, Pudong, before the war. The ferry crossing on the opposite bank was at the Lanlu Wharf. Civilian ferries were suspended for a long time after the war until they resumed last year. Because Yangshupu Lanlu was within the cordon line, the ferry crossing was moved to Qiqihar Road. Passengers crossing the river are mostly female workers from the Yangshupu yarn factory and vegetable vendors. Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, a ferry boat owned by a local man named Zhu Jinbiao (a "wharf boat", larger than ordinary ferries) loaded over a hundred vegetable vendors and female workers at the Lingjia Mu Bridge in Pudong. While rowing to the center of the river, a wooden, pointed-headed Japanese motorboat suddenly sped downstream from the pseudo-"fish market" wharf on Qiwu Pu Road in the west. It collided with Zhu's ferry boat. The motorboat was traveling at a very high speed. Zhu's boat was unable to avoid it, and the front of the port side of the boat was violently hit and split into two sections. The boat immediately flooded and sank. Over a hundred passengers and the boat sank into the water at the same time. A young woman's abdomen was broken by the impact, and her internal organs flowed out. She died in the river. Another vegetable vendor named Jia Abao (from Jiajiajiao) was proficient in swimming. He grabbed onto the Japanese motorboat with both hands, but was pushed into the river and killed by Japanese soldiers with iron poles. The river surface was filled with weeping and crying. Neighboring boats rushed to the rescue. Due to the rapid current and high waves, only over fifty people were rescued on the spot. Over sixty men and women are still missing. After the incident, the Japanese motorboat continued to speed downstream. The customs water patrol and various boatmen rushed to salvage the bodies. As of yesterday evening, a total of six or seven male bodies, over twenty female bodies, and four or five children's bodies had been recovered and placed on the bank of the Lingjia Mu Bridge. Family members gathered on the riverbank weeping in pain. It was a heartbreaking sight. Over thirty bodies are still drifting and their whereabouts are unknown.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6:45 PM, a large gang fight suddenly broke out near the Yangtze Hotel at Yunnan Road, Sanma Road. The police received a report and dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the fight. While the gangsters were still gathering, someone fired a shot. The bullet hit Chen Axi (36 years old, Shanghai resident), a passerby, in the left leg. He was injured and fell to the ground. No. 441 personnel sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his leg bone has been broken and he may be disabled. The gangsters, seeing that they had caused trouble, dispersed and fled without a trace.</p>

<p>Li Miaoquan, a native of Tongzhou residing at No. 4, North Henan Road, went to his house around 6:00 PM on October 8th when his older sister, Zhu Li, came to his house to demand the repayment of 57 yuan owed, leading to an argument. Li Miaoquan instead violently kicked and punched his sister, injuring her abdomen. Mrs. Zhu was six months pregnant and injured. After the incident, the patrol from the Huisi Police Station arrested Li, along with his wife, Wang, and Chen Lianqi, a fellow Tongzhou native involved in the joint assault. They were all escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng, the presiding judge, opened the third criminal court for further interrogation. Attorney Li Zhishan from the police station filed a charge of aggravated assault. The victim, Zhu Li, sick and accompanied by her representative lawyer, Ma Junshuo, appeared in court. Regarding the private prosecution, she demanded compensation for medical expenses and all recuperation costs. Judge Huang interrogated the three defendants and sentenced Li Miaoquan to three months imprisonment, Li Wang to two months imprisonment, with a three-year reprieve, and Chen Lianqi was acquitted for lack of evidence of aiding and abetting the assault. Li Miaoquan was ordered to compensate his older sister, Zhu Li, 150 yuan for medical and other expenses.</p>

<p>Han Yuqi, director, and Ma Rugen, deputy director and chief of the administrative section, of the refugee relief committee affiliated with the Zhen Dan Jin Li Yang Five Counties Association were recently sued by Jiangbei women Ma Sufang and Zhu Shuying, residents of Wanyuanxing Sesame Oil Store Building, No. 3, Xinxin Street, Dapu Bridge, who jointly hired lawyer Cheng Qian and submitted a petition to the criminal court of the First Special Court, accusing them of</p>
<p>**Illegal Detention**</p>
<p>and unlawfully restricting their freedom. They requested that they be punished according to the law and included a civil lawsuit. The reasons for the lawsuit were as follows: The plaintiffs were displaced by the August 13th Incident and had been living in the shelter of the Zhen Dan Jin Li Yang Five Counties Association Refugee Relief Committee for more than a year. Later, they were introduced by the organizers of the shelter to work at the Shenxin Textile Factory No. 9, working diligently and earning a monthly salary of more than 20 yuan. Now, the association has organized a refugee factory specifically for the production of products by refugees, which is a very good intention. However, the factory has recently been organized and is</p>
<p>**Lacking Skilled Labor**</p>
<p>Weavers. Factory director Han Jingqi and others insisted that the plaintiffs go to work at the refugee factory. The plaintiffs had just settled down since starting work at Factory No. 9 and did not want to go. However, the defendants used cruel tactics, forcibly moving all of the plaintiffs' belongings to the refugee factory and canceling the plaintiffs' work names at Factory No. 9. On October 25th at 1:00 PM, they privately arrested them and detained them in an open-air alley at the refugee factory, assigning two people to guard them with wooden sticks in rotation, cutting off their food and drink. At 9:00 PM that night, they were moved upstairs and detained. Later, the plaintiffs wanted to relieve themselves and</p>
<p>**Seized the Opportunity to Escape**</p>
<p>It is found that the defendants are the director and deputy director of the refugee factory, and should have compassion, lead the refugees, and should not rely on their power to bully people and deprive them of their freedom of movement. They have committed a crime under Article 302 of the Criminal Code, and have included a civil lawsuit requesting that the belongings that have been moved be returned. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Peishen took the seat in the second criminal court for hearing. The defendants also arrived with their lawyer, Ma Nangeng. The plaintiffs, Ma Sufang and Zhu Shuying, successively submitted their cases and explained the situation. When questioned, the defendants claimed that the plaintiffs were previously in the refugee shelter and they introduced them to</p>
<p>**Shenxin Factory No. 9**</p>
<p>to work, with a monthly salary of 12 yuan. The purpose of the introduction at the time was for them to practice and learn so that they would still return after becoming skilled to teach novice workers, and a voluntary letter was written. Now that our shelter has established its own refugee factory, which officially started work on October 22nd, we sent a letter to Shenxin Factory No. 9 to transfer the plaintiffs back, with a monthly salary of 12 yuan. The plaintiffs' lawsuit to your court is obviously for other purposes and is being instigated by someone. The allegations are completely untrue and should be investigated thoroughly. Judge Xiao verified the statements and ruled that the defendants Han Jingqi and Ma Rugen were not guilty.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Chinese Buddhist Association Expresses Uncertainty; Circularity About Yuan Ying's Whereabouts <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>It is Rumored That His Whereabouts Are Uncertain; One Explanation Regarding the Contents of Fundraising</p>
<p>Master Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, has been missing for two and a half weeks since being taken away from Yuanming Lecture Hall on Daxi Road on the 19th of last month. His whereabouts are extremely unclear. The incident has greatly shocked Buddhists across the country and has drawn significant attention. A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited the Chinese Buddhist Association at No. 418 Hede Road yesterday morning and was received by Mr. Hu. According to him, Master Yuan Ying had originally planned to return to Southeast Asia after spending the Mid-Autumn Festival in Shanghai this year, after returning from Southeast Asia in July. This unfortunate event is truly unfortunate. Although there are many rumors about his whereabouts, they are all speculation. To date, the association has not received any reliable information about his whereabouts. Mr. Hu continued to defend Yuan Ying on the issue of fundraising in Southeast Asia, saying that Yuan Ying raised a total of over 70,000 yuan in Southeast Asia. The rumor of raising over one million yuan is completely unfounded. The funds were used for expenses such as the monks' burial team, the monks' rescue team, and assisting refugee children's organizations in Hong Kong, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. The distribution of the above funds was said to have been approved by the assistance committee organized by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Love Is Mysterious: It Can Bring Joy and Sorrow <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of a Russian Labor University</p>
<p>One of the happiest things in life is love between men and women. However, one of the most tragic things in the world is an unhappy marriage. Many couples in society often lament their dissatisfaction with each other, and those with stubborn natures do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. Therefore, it is better to live alone and happily than to have an unhappy union. However, since the purpose of life is reproduction, and we are endowed by nature with two major desires—appetite and sexual desire—we ultimately cannot resist nature. Therefore, the only remedy is to enrich our knowledge of seeking love after marriage.</p>
<p>To study the methods of seeking love, the first question that must be clarified is the source of love between men and women. This question actually involves medicine, as countless famous medical experts throughout the world unanimously believe that love between men and women is related to energy. The sexologist Dr. Havelock Ellis of England once stated frankly: "True love between husband and wife comes from reproductive desire." This is a profound statement, because after a night of passion, men and women become even more intimate. However, to maintain this kind of love permanently and to continuously generate new love, the man's energy must be healthy to stimulate the other party. If the man's reproductive ability is weak and cannot arouse the other party's pleasure, the two parties cannot coordinate in their love life, and love will rapidly decline, even to the point where the two parties become enemies, inevitably leading to the breakdown of the marriage!</p>
<p>Smart men: On your wedding night, do you consider that your future reproductive power will gradually decline? If you want to consider this point, then you must first avoid excessive indulgence, because after excessive indulgence, neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, and impotence can erupt, increasing the other party's annoyance and blocking the door to your pursuit of love.</p>
<p>The causes of premature ejaculation, impotence, and neurasthenia have been described above. However, the method of treatment must start with increasing essence and replenishing blood. Therefore, the first choice for symptomatic treatment is "Body-Con" for men, a testicular essence preparation invented by Dr. Merren of Germany. After taking it, the reproductive function becomes lively and healthy, the complexion becomes rosy, and after taking it for a season, the five bodies flourish. Women should take "Body-Con" for women, the ingredients of which are made from ovarian secretions. Therefore, it has special effects on women's irregular menstruation, infertility after marriage, and all uterine diseases. Women with flat breasts who take this will be able to increase their bust and restore their health and beauty.</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Harms of Coughing and Excessive Phlegm <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang, Lung Disease Expert</p>
<p>Except for dry coughs, most cough patients have phlegm, and some have excessive phlegm without coughing. Both are pathological conditions of the lungs. Those with strong lungs have less phlegm, and those with weak lungs have more. If there is a disease inside, it is even more serious. This is because bacteria erode the lungs, causing increased secretions. However, the reproduction of bacteria often uses phlegm masses as nests. Therefore, those with excessive phlegm are prone to danger. If you observe the progression of pulmonary tuberculosis, you will see that coughing and expectoration increase sharply. Conversely, if the amount of phlegm gradually decreases, the disease will also gradually decline. Anyone with a little common sense can understand this. Therefore, people who usually have excessive phlegm must pay close attention. If their physical strength is once insufficient, an accident may occur, and in severe cases, it can become pneumonia or terrible pulmonary gangrene, which will be overwhelming. Those who are fortunate enough to turn into chronic cases often become pulmonary tuberculosis or bronchiectasis, which linger for a long time and are difficult to cure. Treatment is very difficult. Therefore, they suffer from illness for life, or unexpected changes occur along the way, which is very worrying. This is why the call to reduce pulmonary tuberculosis is becoming increasingly loud in the medical community. From my many years of experience, the shortcut to removing phlegm and relieving cough is to take "Bu Fei Na Er." I still remember that at the beginning of last month, Mr. Jin Hanxiang suffered from a cold, followed by a persistent cough and expectoration, which lasted for two months. Repeated medical treatments were ineffective, and he also used various cough suppressants and antitussives on the market, but none of them had any effect. Moreover, the symptoms sometimes worsened. The color of the phlegm turned yellow, and he coughed about a pack of cigarettes a day. He lost weight sharply, and was exhausted and tired. I instructed him to take "Bu Fei Na Er." Within a few hours of taking it, the cough was greatly reduced, and in a short period of time, the phenomenon of coughing disappeared. At the same time, the phlegm mass gradually became thin and reduced. He was finally completely cured in a short period of time, his energy gradually recovered, and his weight gradually increased until he regained his health before the illness. I heard that his parents were old and had a lot of phlegm, so I also instructed them to take "Bu Fei Na Er" and they were cured. This agent is not only good at removing phlegm, but also a tonic. As for its cough-suppressing effect, it is entirely due to the drug's efficacy, and no inferior ingredients with anesthetic properties are added to it.</p>
<h3 id="e95">New Weapon for Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>Judging from the enthusiastic movement to combat gonorrhea in modern European and American countries, it is clear that gonorrhea threatens human survival. According to news released by the Scientific New Society, more than 60 groups to reduce gonorrhea have been organized in the past two years to jointly eradicate gonorrhea. The only weapon they rely on to treat gonorrhea is "Kelinnong," a preparation made from a mixture of protein bodies and yellow pigment. Originally, "Kelinnong" was invented by Dr. Peter, the German ambassador for gonorrhea. Because its ingredients are scientifically blended and precisely packaged, it has no adverse effects after taking it. Therefore, it is effective for all gonorrhea, whether acute or chronic. Its bactericidal power occurs at the site of the lesion, just right, without being excessive or insufficient. It can be called an all-powerful preparation among oral medications for gonorrhea. Therefore, it is popular all over the world. In my decades of experience, "Kelinnong" is the leader among oral medications. As for external use, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used. Women can use "Carl Shendi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. They can all be treated at home according to the instructions and can be cured in a short time.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Case of Cured Seminal Emission: The Value of Health Preservation <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, German Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>A patient named Tang Guozhi, from Wuxi, 22 years old, (claimed)——I have always been strong. When I was 17 years old, I liked to read obscene books and pornographic movies, so I developed the bad habit of masturbation. After about half a year, I gradually realized the harm of masturbation and wanted to quit. Unexpectedly, the habit had become established, and although I had a firm determination, I was unable to quit completely. But because I was strong, I didn't have many symptoms. When I was 19 years old, I once prostituted myself with a friend. A week later, I contracted gonorrhea. Fortunately, I was treated quickly and recovered soon. Unexpectedly, after that, I suddenly had seminal emissions. At first, it was nocturnal emission, but later it was emission without dreams, and my body became extremely weak and my brain became even weaker. Although I took tonics, they had no effect. Today, I saw the newspaper report and came to seek treatment. (Treatment process)——I ordered him to practice health preservation, avoid evil thoughts, engage in noble entertainment, pay attention to exercise, rub the local area with cold water before going to bed, and take "Yi Nai Er Si Seminal Emission Tablets" three times a day. I also ordered him to avoid irritating products such as tobacco and alcohol. Mr. Tang followed my words and acted accordingly. A week later, the seminal emission had stopped. He also took "Body-Con" for two months, and his brain was clear, he slept soundly, and his health had been fully restored.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Gonorrhea Destroys Reproduction <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The seminal vesicles and testicles are important organs of the internal reproductive system, serving as storage for sperm or as a reservoir for semen sent from the testicles. Once this area is invaded by gonococci, the sperm stored in the past will be poisoned, and the major task of human reproduction will be destroyed, with all unfortunate events arising from this.</p>
<p>Gonococcal seminal vesiculitis can also be divided into acute and chronic types. Its occurrence is mostly caused by prostatitis, vasitis, etc., which is the source of recurrent epididymitis. The general symptoms are mostly abdominal distension, with pain radiating from the seminal vesicle area to the surrounding area, or affecting the anus and perineum, giving an unpleasant feeling. The penis also constantly has stinging or even itching pain. This pain often becomes the cause of seminal vesicle hernia pain. The pain of seminal vesicle compression is particularly severe during urination. At this time, if you still indulge in bad surgery and are misled by inferior drugs, you will inevitably make one mistake after another, and your reproductive ability will be completely destroyed to the point of being irreparable. Therefore, at this time, if you can abandon unreasonable medical treatment as soon as possible and switch to the latest invented gonorrhea special drug "New Kelinnong," so that its bactericidal power can directly reach the lesion without any side effects. On the one hand, the German inductive electrostatic therapy and WettererX therapy are used to assist in plastic surgery to correct the pathological condition, so that the important reproductive organs that are frequently damaged can be restored to completeness. I have more than 20 years of experience in these therapies and can ensure that patients are free from the pain of leukorrhea, and at the same time, I can restore the reproductive function of patients with leukorrhea. There is no case of failure. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting from today, 20 numbers are sent for consultation every day. Each number only costs 5 jiao, and a copy of "The Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" is given, which has a detailed description of gonorrhea and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Paradise and Cigars <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Bian Luo</p>
<p>Whenever I have insomnia, my thoughts are like kites with broken strings, falling anywhere, without any certainty. Sometimes I also think of some interesting things and write them down as essays, which is also a way to make good use of waste. I don't know how, but I thought of a film I had seen in the past.</p>
<p>It seemed to be promoting science, but in reality, it was a film in which white people preached religion to black people. The special thing was that all the characters were black. The stories were all taken from the Bible or legendary sacred deeds. If you haven't read the Bible, you're not very interested. The box office was very poor, and many people left halfway through.</p>
<p>But what makes me think of it now is a section depicting paradise. In addition to being able to fly on clouds, there are also cigars distributed, one to each person, which they smoke heartily, and use to invite God to smoke. Maybe this is the black people's paradise. I don't know if it's like that in the Bible. But the scene of performing the smoking of cigars aroused laughter from the foreign audience, and the attitude was not very serious. This makes me think that the restraint of foreign gentlemen smoking in front of ladies seems to be a blessing in the black people's paradise.</p>
<p>However, this paradise is indeed built by gentlemen, but it's only for black people and above to visit.</p>
<p>From the question of whether you can smoke cigars in paradise, I feel that people's imaginations are limited in a very pitiful way, and even the imagination of happiness is not very superhuman. Religious people always imagine heaven and hell based on people's likes and dislikes. A friend once said to me: He doesn't believe in religion because there are too many etiquette rules in heaven, which is very troublesome and not happy at all. He admitted that he could only wander outside the gates of heaven and hell.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone imagines paradise differently. It seems very complicated to create a paradise model that is applicable to everyone. This is the bankruptcy of paradise and the sorrow of religious people.</p>
<p>The human world is still the human world. Although it's a little dirty, we just need to be diligent in cleaning it up.</p>
<p>A paradise with cigars to eat is at most a harmless joke. If it were reality, it would be a great tragedy of the 1940s.</p>
<p>However, alas, really alas! Some kind of paradise is not an ideal paradise.</p>
<p>I'm going to sing hymns.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Burial of Memories <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Bian Chen</p>
<p>I checked my luggage several times, each time picking out things that I thought were dangerous. In the end, I only had a few ragged clothes left, so I felt relieved. As soon as the sun set, I said goodbye to my colleagues in the factory, shook their hands, and the emotion moved their words, trembling their heartfelt confessions incoherently. However, I understood that I was leaving them with their expectations on my shoulders. I hurriedly boarded the streetcar.</p>
<p>At the dock, the customs clock was only striking eight, but the ship was scheduled to leave at twelve. The money in my pocket wasn't enough, so I couldn't be with the noble passengers. I took the cheapest steerage class, where there were only a few benches. The so-called "dining room" was spacious, with soft stools and hot towels, and the cabins were even more interesting, where you could dream just like at home.</p>
<p>But I hadn't had a good dream for years. What's a few hours' journey! I just had to be patient. I had no companions, so I had to watch my things myself. I couldn't relax while sitting on the bench. If I relaxed, something would go wrong. My things might be taken away, or someone might snatch my seat, and it would be difficult to deal with when they were sleeping soundly on it! I resisted my fatigue and the vendors' shouts! I waited until midnight, and the ship began to sail on the dark river.</p>
<p>After the ship left the Wusong estuary, most people huddled up and dozed off because of fatigue and the thin cold of midnight. Outside the舷 was a piece of darkness. The indicator lights on the few buoys, now bright now dark, made people miss the fireflies of summer nights. Illuminated by these "fireflies," you could discern a few dilapidated giant ships passing by in the darkness.</p>
<p>This was a trip that didn't match my imagination at all. The midnight cold mixed with fatigue into such an unbearable suffering!</p>
<p>When the color of the sky outside the舷 could discern a little melancholic gray-green, the canary raised by the sailor began to call. However, I had already paid all my energy to cope with the cold and fatigue. At this time, I watched with excitement as my ship glided towards the golden waves!</p>
<p>The ship docked in the morning sun. I would disembark at the third port. I remembered a burden left in my memory—a diary. So I checked my luggage again, took it out, and carefully examined it. At the beginning of the volume was a portrait of myself, below which was written "Adversity Calendar," followed by a few lines that I still vaguely remembered:</p>
<p>This is my lodging on the snail's tail,</p>
<p>Shadow of a solitary step drawn in space,</p>
<p>This is my love, hate, sorrow, and joy,</p>
<p>But I will love her without choosing.</p>
<p>I was a little apprehensive. This child of suffering, she depicted my hardship and misfortune, she depicted a series of days of my own embarrassment, insecurity, exile, and hope. Its authenticity was the reason I loved it, but now, this little bit of authenticity would also become the reason for my suffering.</p>
<p>I gathered the determination to part with the "past." Go, the dregs left in my memory:—I threw this string of calendars into the golden waves!</p>
<p>Friend! My hand trembled a little. Behind my generosity, there was inevitably a stingy hidden pain. Plus, it floated up from the waves again and never sank. How painful!</p>
<p>I was frightened. Fortunately, no one noticed, but this black cover, scarlet paper edges, floated forever in the center of the river until it was a small black shadow.</p>
<p>Now, I have watched her follow the river and roll into the Yellow Sea. Friend: I am very ashamed. I almost cried. I was really as sad as losing a daughter.</p>
<p>I remembered the two epigraphs at the beginning of this calendar. Let me find some comfort here!</p>
<p>By writing it, I feel relieved.</p>
<p>I can put down this burden of memory!</p>
<p>Now even this little memory on paper has been thrown into the Yellow Sea, then, "Goodbye, shadow of the past!"</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Returning Finger <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>A finger isn't anything rare.</p>
<p>A finger that grabs a piece of charcoal and draws circles on the wall to record work hours, what's so great about it. There are really not a few fingers like that in the world that draw the scars of humanity.</p>
<p>To put it more amusingly, it's just that finger that children usually hold in their mouths, all wet.</p>
<p>No matter how restless a finger is, it shouldn't arouse the interest of a philosopher's research, and the law against disturbing public order has never noticed this tiny bit of life.</p>
<p>This time, a villager sent me a letter saying that A Wu, in his last struggle for life on the battlefield, entrusted his partner to bring back a finger. When I opened it, it really looked like a stiff silkworm. The villagers spread it as an amazing miracle, saying that A Wu also had a way.</p>
<p>The partner said: "A Wu ate a row of bullets by the river. After shouting a few times, I snaked over and carried him behind a cemetery, applied medicine, and bandaged the wound. He resisted, cut off this finger, and didn't say anything else, just said this sentence: 'Those who pull the trigger all use this one...' Then he fell!"</p>
<p>A Wu was a farmer who "did odd jobs" and "ate shoulder skin rice" (Note). He often appeared in the homes of those who plowed with their eyes and helped with farm work. After eating mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival the year before last, a division suddenly passed through the border on a starry night, and he seemed to have disappeared. The news that he had died on the battlefield had been passed on countless times, but it was never confirmed.

<h3 id="e101">A Brief Discussion on Phonetic Script <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ren</p>
<p>At this language exhibition, there was a performance of blind people reading and writing. A charitable friend was deeply moved upon seeing it, almost to tears, and told me upon returning that he wished to donate some money to them because this kind of education is truly great and should be supported.</p>
<p>Indeed, the blind are among the most unfortunate of humankind. Their lives are filled only with darkness, without light. However, humanity is, after all, progressing, and now there is special education for the blind that can compensate for this natural deficiency.</p>
<p>What is most special about this special education? It is the complete replacement of our original "square characters" with "phonetic script." Once the blind are proficient in the alphabet of phonetic script, they can read and write like ordinary people.</p>
<p>This makes me think of illiterate people, whom we often call "the unlettered." They also suffer greatly because of their illiteracy. We often see people at tram stops asking, "Sir, which tram is this?" Isn't the tram number clearly written? But for those who cannot read, it's as if it's not there. How pitiful!</p>
<p>So, why don't we also use "phonetic script" to eliminate illiteracy? Currently, phonetic script is certainly not as "respectable" or "aristocratic" as square characters. However, phonetic script is easy to learn and can be mastered in at most two or three weeks, making it as easy and accessible to the masses as "deep-fried dough sticks and soybean milk." Otherwise, I'm afraid square characters will never be accessible to the blind.</p>
<p>Therefore, knowing square characters is like a rich person riding in a car, while reading phonetic script is like a poor person riding in a tram. Let each go their own way and find their own place. If we oppose others promoting phonetic script simply because we already know square characters, then we would be like car riders stubbornly opposing others from riding trams, which is utterly unreasonable.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Anna May Wong's Melancholy About Being in Movies <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Tao</p>
<p>We all know that Anna May Wong is Chinese, but she is not a daughter who grew up in China. She grew up in the Chinese district of Los Angeles, USA. Anna May Wong's father's name is Huang Sanxin, and her mother's maiden name was Li. From a young age, she had hopes of entering the film industry, so she later changed her name to Anna May Wong. This was because she anticipated that this name would be more suitable in the film industry!</p>
<p>Not long ago, Anna May Wong published an article expressing her sadness about being in movies. In one passage, she said, "When I entered the film industry, I felt that I had realized my long-held hope, and I have recently been playing female lead roles in films! Although I do not hope to become a very famous movie star, it can be said that I am the only Chinese woman living a screen life in the Hollywood film industry!"</p>
<p>"There are millions of Chinese expatriates all over the world, and there are also thousands in the United States, including a small number of artists. In this situation, I find it a bit strange and a bit disappointingly depressing. Why? Because there is no famous Chinese male star in the Hollywood film industry. This makes my chances of performing romances on the screen hopeless! But I am not sad because there are no romances, but when I see other actresses performing romances, I cannot help but have some feelings!"</p>
<p>Anna May Wong is a very enthusiastic Chinese. Two years ago, she returned to China with her parents, so she has a better understanding of the motherland. She has not been back to the motherland since. After she returned to the United States, she signed a contract with Paramount Pictures to shoot several films. Her most recent film was "King of Chinatown," which she co-starred in with Akim Tamiroff. The film that followed was "North of Singapore," which is set in China. The content is probably more progressive than the films she made before returning to China. Especially since the war of resistance, the Hollywood film industry has changed its past attitude and will no longer produce films that insult China.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Bell Has Rung <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>The "Big Bell" Drama Society held its first public performance at the Xuan Palace Theater on Sunday morning. Although only three one-act plays and two dances were performed, most of them were meaningful. At this time and in this place, they gave the audience a lot of stimulation and excitement.</p>
<p>"Twilight of an Old Villa" is a Soviet defense play, depicting how a female spy is caught by a falsely named engineer, clever and full of changes. The dance "Madre Mia" was created and performed by Yang Fan himself. This "star pupil" of Wu Xiaobang is now even more advanced. Aren't there often national heroes in Madre Mia fighting for their country? This song and dance is about the farewell of a national hero's lover as he goes off to war. Although it is about the Soviet Union and Spain, it can also be said to be about China.</p>
<p>Wu Tian's creation "Departure" is the most meaningful. A musician, unable to bear a year of depression, finally steels himself to abandon his blind mother, his understanding wife, and his crying child, and resolutely leaves. In the past, we often saw news in the newspapers about the departure of admirable young people, some encouraged by their parents, some leaving secretly without their parents knowing. The day before yesterday, we also saw news in the newspapers about the pen-wielding team and the acting team led by Hong Shen and Ma Yanxiang. Now, seeing this play about these departing people, we truly feel admiration and gratitude, and at the same time, we feel ashamed in our hearts. Lu Ji, playing the wife, said, "After you leave, I can teach, I can do something beneficial to society." This resolute decision, abandoning love and prioritizing the country, earned the applause of the entire audience.</p>
<p>Wu Tian often uses suggestion to write about the musician's state of mind and the reality of the environment. For example, when the musician asks the policeman about the desolate dawn, it is because he feels pain. He probably also thinks about the difficult life he will encounter after he leaves. His wife and his mother both talked about how when he was a child, he would fight with others, and if he couldn't beat them, he would hide in the peach tree, but he would still fight with the other children. Later, they also said that the peach tree would bloom with vibrant flowers, and the birds would sing joyfully among the trees. What a good metaphor this is, and what meaningful words! The bell has rung, this extraordinary first sound!</p>
<h3 id="e104">Miss Ning Xuan, a famous amateur performer in Shanghai, grew up in the north and speaks fluent and melodious Mandarin. She is slender and of moderate height. Her appearance when dressed in costume from the drama Hong Bi Lou is absolutely stunning. Recently, Yihua Film Company, having heard of her fame, invited her to join them. Miss Ning has always been interested in screen work. In the past, she has made guest appearances in films such as "A Record of a Film Studio" and "Women's Apartment," so she immediately agreed to Yihua's offer. It is said that she has already signed a contract a few days ago. <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>

<h3 id="e105">Chen Yunshang's New Film "Fei Zhen'e Assassination of the Tiger" Begins Filming <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Di</p>
<p>After Chen Yunshang's starring film "One Night Empress" was publicly screened at the Shanghai Guangda Theater, the Huacheng Film Studio began discussing the subject matter of Chen Yunshang's fourth work. Initially, it was decided that Fang Peilin's direction of "Sakyamuni" would be co-starred by Chen Yunshang and Mei Xi. Now, for the sake of solemn production, "Sakyamuni" will be fully prepared and will not be filmed for the time being. Thus, "Fei Zhen'e Assassination of the Tiger" was decided to be filmed first.</p>
<p>"Fei Zhen'e Assassination of the Tiger" is a famous play on the stage. In the past, Mei Lanfang also filmed it, but it was only a fragment of Peking Opera. Now, what Huacheng is filming is the entire tragic story of Fei Zhen'e's assassination of the tyrant, directed by Li Pingqian, with Chen Yunshang playing Fei Zhen'e. Filming began last week at the Lilac Garden Studio.</p>
<p>The role of "One Tiger," who has malicious intentions towards Fei Zhen'e, is played by Xu Xinyuan. This Chinese detective Chen Charlie on the screen ends up dying at the hands of a palace maid. It is expected that under the performance of Chen Yunshang and Xu Xinyuan, this scene will be very tense and moving.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Lafei Organizes Its Own Backstage Team, Henceforth With a Fresh Look <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>A few days ago, there was a news item in this publication about the Lafei Theater, roughly saying that the theater would be organizing a backstage team led by Mr. Xu Bu from the sixteenth of this month. This news is now in the past and is slightly inaccurate. According to what the author knows, I will write it out to inform those who care about spoken drama:</p>
<p>After the contract between the Film Union Troupe and Lafei expired at the end of last month, the Film Union did not continue because of the urgent work of filming. At that time, Mr. Xu Bu planned to invite someone to be the backstage boss to cooperate with the Lafei front desk, but now, the front desk does not intend to cooperate with others and will organize its own backstage team. Currently, long-term contracts have been signed with Tan Guangyou, Ge Xin, Chen Yulin, Cai Jinglu, and other members of the China Travel returning troupe from Shanghai, as well as Cai Jin, Shen Ling, Shao Hua, and others from the Shanghai drama community. Everything has been arranged, and from the next new play "Peach Blossom Dream" onwards, they will meet the audience with this fresh look. For the first half of November (performing "The Misanthrope" and "An Ideal Husband"), according to the Lafei administration, this is a transitional period.</p>
<p>In the past year, the spoken drama movement has once again seen a vigorous trend. We hope that Lafei can thrive from now on.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>A play praising national heroes</p>
<p>Suddenly, I thought of the fact that today is my mother's birthday. However, because the national crisis is pressing, I have forgotten my family for the sake of the country, and I don't even know what day it is today. Thinking of this, I felt extremely uneasy and hurriedly prostrated myself on the ground. At this time, Zhou's mother did not know that Daizhou had already fallen, and still thought that Yu Ji had come specifically to celebrate her birthday, so the whole family, from the Grand Madam down, was overjoyed and even more delighted than when Zhou had not yet arrived. At the banquet, Yu Ji alone suffered in his heart, not daring to speak plainly. He thought to himself that after seeing the bandit troops enter Dai, they would surely take advantage of the victory to attack Ningwu. At this time, the whole family is gathered together, but in a short while, when the bandit soldiers arrive, they will all be ghosts with severed heads. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but burst into tears. The Grand Madam was very discerning. At this time, there was a famine in the world, and bandit soldiers were rising up everywhere. She had already heard about the attack by the rebel army. Now that the war was in full swing, Yu Ji, who was responsible for defending the territory, could not possibly have taken the time to come here at this time. At first, when she saw his face full of exhaustion and his restless state, she had already suspected something. Now, suddenly seeing him bowing his head in thought, tears streaming down his face, she had already guessed most of it in her heart. Therefore, she hurriedly asked Yu Ji, "How did Daizhou fall? Why don't you tell me the truth?" When Yu Ji saw that his mother had already seen through him, he immediately knelt down and recounted the details of his battle with the rebel bandits, and said that the rebel leader Hong Ji had been captured, and the rebel brother One Tiger had had an arm cut off, and countless rebel soldiers had been killed, but because the rebel soldiers were too numerous and there was no external assistance, the isolated city was difficult to defend. Now he planned to return to the government to bid farewell to his mother and make one last appearance, and then fight to the death to repay the country. When Zhou's mother heard this, not only did she not wail like an ignorant village woman, but she also smiled and comforted Yu Ji, saying, "I have worked hard for the Zhou family, teaching my son to become famous, and I originally hoped that my son would be able to be loyal and repay the country. Today's events are exactly what I have always wished for. Moreover, I have lived to be seventy years old, and I will not die young. If you can repay the country, I will die first to strengthen your resolve." (140)</p>
