<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c18">英法承認西國民軍政府以後 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>去年艾登訪問美國時·羅斯福總統曾經暗示他：英國對於西班牙叛軍政府是萬萬承認不得的。羅斯福總統的理由很明白，因為義德法西斯指揮下的西班牙國民軍只不過是一個傀儡·承認國長軍政府就等於承認法西斯侵略為合法。民主國家旣不能積極帮助政府軍，但對侵略者至少應該嚴持「不承認主義」。然而張伯倫達拉第顯然不肯體會羅總統的暗示，而終於在西班牙抗戰進人危急關頭的今天，公然决定承認西班牙國民軍政府為合法政府了。承認國民軍政府就等於不承認西班牙人民所選出的合法政府的存在，在英法乃至全世界和平人民高呼「援助西班牙共和國」的今天，英法政府這種鼓勵侵略的舉措，實在是這反了國際的正義，背叛了國內多數的人民。</p>
<p>而且，英，法，兩國這次承認西班牙國民軍政府的不義行為，不僅違棄了民治的立塲，就是從它們本身利益上講，也是不可理解的。誰都知道地中海是不列顚的生命綫，直布羅陀尤是地中海東面的門戶。如果墨索里尼的傀儡弗朗哥統制了西班牙，那末，他們就可以從西班牙各港口如卡狄茨，休太，美里拉，巴爾瑪，以及卡太琴那來割斷直布羅陀的交通；義大利海軍更可以從其根據地帕的拉里亞等使瑪爾太陷於孤立，英國的航路必將受極大的脅害，而地中海，真的有成為「義大利內湖」的危險了。</p>
<p>由於地理上的接近，一個法西斯的西班牙對於法國威脅自然更大。從法國本部吐隆到北菲邊塞太等各地的交通，實代表着法國在西地中海霸權的基石。如果西班牙的地中海沿岸落入法西斯勢力的掌握中，那西班牙的從巴薩洛那—瑪洪—卡太琴那所構成的三角形，就將根本摧毀法國在西地中海的這個基石了。不僅如此。法國和西班牙只隔了一座比里牛斯山，自從巴薩洛那失陷後，法國和西班牙國民軍轄境接壤處有六百里之長，法國南面出現了法西斯的敵人，它今天是已陷於三面包團之中了。</p>
<p>法西斯的西班牙對於英法的威脅既如上述，英法保衛它自身的利益，理應放棄「不千涉」政策，給予西班牙共和政府以積極援助，那纔是辦法；可是他們却為什麼偏偏要承認國民軍政府呢？老實說，這是因為他們自始失策，現在木已成舟，悔已不及，只得將錯就錯借此下臺罷了，</p>
<p>可是他們也有自圓其說的理由，據法總理達拉第二十四日在衆院中演說，承認國民軍的理由約有兩點：（一）「國民軍政府旣為西國事實上的政府、法國即應與之樹立善鄰關係；」（二）「法國在西境所保有之利益、至為重要，故有派遣正式代表駐在蒲爾哥斯城之必要。」英法當局的用意是很明白的，他們想在西班牙政府軍隊尚未全敗之前，先下手來討好弗期哥，以「抵銷義德在西班牙的勢力」；張伯倫一向打着「如意算盤」，認為義德法西斯雖能征服西班牙，但却無力建設西班牙，一等戰爭結束，要建設西班牙，就得聽命倫敦的，那時英國就可以代替墨索里尼來控制弗朗哥了。</p>
<p>張伯倫這樣打算怕不免成為空洞的幻想。誰不知今天的弗朗哥已决不能有自主的意志了。他無力撒退外國法西斯的軍隊，他也不能撤退外國的軍隊。第一·墨萦里尼不是傻子，兩年以來黑衫軍隊開到伊比利半島成千成萬的犧牲，難道真的為了「對西班牙並無領土野心」麼？義大利志願兵至今不肯撤退，也永遠不肯撒退的。第二，弗期哥軍隊的能夠進展，主要是靠了黑衫軍的力量，沒有黑衫軍的支持，弗朗哥傀儡是站不住脚的。法國社會黨議員伊薩爾曾經指出：「前當國民軍司令路易上校乘英艦往米諾加島與政府軍當局會商和平接收事宜時，義國飛行員曾向該島轟炸、於以見西國國民軍所屬義國部隊乃服從墨索里尼命令，非弗朗哥所得而指揮。」從這一點，也就可以知道弗朗哥統治的西班牙，實際上等於墨索里尼手中的西班牙。</p>
<p>現在，英法承認西班牙國民軍政府的舉動，已引起了英法國內人民劇烈的反對了，據二十六日海通電所傳，西班牙總理奈格林也已堅决宣言抗戰到底。美國名記者費休說得極透切：「西班牙是不能被征服的。她卽使一時壓了下去，六個月以後仍將爆發內戰。弗朗哥决不能帶來了和平。」</p>
<p>英法承認西班牙國民軍政府的結果沒有別的，它只是鼓勵了法西斯侵略者更大的野心，加深了國際的新危機。據巴黎政界人士的觀察，這種新危機已有在下月中爆發的朕兆了。我們且等着看吧！</p>

<p>日方顯在威脅英國　查寳安南頭、旣非軍事據點、又無中國駐軍、且地近英界、日軍實無進攻之必要、而深圳自一度為日軍佔領、後經英國之交涉退出後、華方亦無軍隊駐守其地、故此次日軍之突然攻佔寳安南頭及轟炸、深圳且更不顧一切、侵入英界上空並向廣九路英叚車站車輛投彈、其為出於有計劃的預謀、似頗明顯、據一般觀察、日軍此舉、共唯一目的、在試探英國之真正態度、並威脅英國、使其對於華南局勢、不作積極之表示、蓋自日軍攻佔海南島後、英法熊度、實有轉趨强硬之可能、故有意再予英方以威脅、以探究竟、現在英國方面對於日軍日機之新威脅、已提出抗議、今後華南時局之發展、將更令人注視矣、</p>

<p>— 黃式金</p>
<p>中學敎師進修上上上之困難與解除</p>
<p>中學敎師之進修雖屬重要、但敎師進修上之困難問題、若不設法解除、則雖有了進修之機會、敎師們未必自動地樂意去進修的、浙江敎育廳與浙江大學會經合辦敎育服務人員暑期進修講習會、費了很大的力量、中學敎員到者祇有六十七人、又上海市敎育局曾舉辦過中等學校科學敎員講習會、因為參加的人不多、會經通令各校强迫參加、並以解約相威脅、所以要在職敎師去進修、先要知其困難、設法解决、訂定有效的辦法、鼓勵其上進之意志、敎師進修之困難、舉其要者、不外下列數端、（甲）經濟問題、敎師薪金、本甚微薄、平日開支、猶感不足、子女敎育經費尙難籌措、那有餘資作自己進修之用、對於經濟問題解除之方法、在服務的學校方面、應視其服務年限、給以相當之資助、進修以後在職位及薪金上應增進　其等級、在進修的學校方面、除免收其學膳等費外、並應多設獎學金額、（乙）家庭問題、有些敎師因為缺乏暫時拋棄妻子兄女之勇氣、不忍遠離家鄉、以致未能h進、兒女情長、英雄氣短、確乎也是一個真實的困難、再加上經濟問題之考慮、無怪其不能實行了、此問題解除的關鍵、大半還在家庭範圍之內、有深思遠慮的人、對於進修之計劃、應當極力促其實現、不應當加以阻難、進修者可以保存退步者必歸淘汰、家庭中人、關懷至切、若能細加體味、善為疎解、自可不成問題的、（丙）心理問題、敎師之自足心理、苟安態度、實為進修之最大仇敵、敎師們每覺自身工作、尚能應付、旣可按步就班、安度歲月、何必勞心進修、多此一舉、欲打破此種困難、須由政府公布敎師進修規程、督促學校推行、並規定中等學校敎員任用規程、注重專業訓練之資格、由學校方　面擬定敎師進修辦法、對於有志　進修之敎師、予以經濟上之便利、及精神上之鼓勵、此外社會方面、亦應造成敎師進修之濃厚空氣、使為敎師者、有非進修不足以為人師之感覺（丁）進修機關問題、敎師到那裏去進修、負責師資訓練之機關能否給敎師以進修之方便、在過去確是問題、現在全國各區有了師範學院、此問題就較易解决了、師範學院除招收高初中敎員進修班直接予以進修外、此他間接的方法、亦是很有效率的、照師範學院規程第四條所云、「師範學院應協助所劃區內敎育行政機關、研究輔覺該區內之中等敎育、」在此條範圍以內、師範學院與敎育行政機關對於中學敎師進修方面可舉行的事件是很多的、如召集所屬敎師舉行各種會議、組織講習會、開辦暑期研究會等、此種方式、在英國巳風行一時、中國尚係初創、如擬訂督學視導計劃、改進敎師敎學效能、如發行敎育刊物、使敎師增進學識、如開函授班或敎師通訊、使敎師可有問津之處、如設立巡廻讀書會及示範敎育、使敎師有嘗可借、可範可循、如編造敎育工具、指導實捻計劃、使有研究興趣的敎師、在工作上得到方便與指示、上述數種、不過舉其大者、若能次第實行、終敎師之進修上實有極大之帮助、</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>總之、現代國家、沒有不知道師範敎育之重要的、尤其當一個國家在大破壞之後、敎育實為新建設必由之途徑、而師範敎育尤是整個新敎育的最基本的工作、今後的青年是復興國家的主人、而培養這些主人的敎師之師範學院是要負起其最重大的使命的、現在一般在職中學敎師、資格是不符的、弱點是很多的、若是不加進修、是不能長此任訓練青年之重仟的、現在應當在全國師範學院設立之秋、乘機作進修之企圖、在師範學院方面、對於在職之中　學師資、應計劃有效的辦法、使敎師得進修之便利、此外、敎育行政機關及學校當局、亦均應極力鼓勵進修計劃之實現、並為敎師解除其進修上之問題、敎師有了良好的進修、青年就得了良好的導師、國家就有了復　興的基礎、若敎師缺乏　健全的訓綀、如何能培植國家有用的青年呢、歐美先進各國、都很重視師範敎育、注意敎師進修、可謂知道從事基本　工作的了、（完）</p>

<p>首飾金改昂二次</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十一時〇五分、因烚赤潛勢緊俏、故亦隨之掛大一元、後又至下午二時半、因給赤又繼續高昂、故亦再掛大一元、大問行老慶雲等改漲二百十九元、新同行亦改懸二百十七元、收進二百十一元、均創有市以來之空前高峯、</p>
<p>中純金所跌甚微</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價、續退至一千二百〇九元九角、掛牌海關金未更、計二元三角九分二厘、上海標準標金價亦隨降七角，計一千二百〇五元二角、乃二十五日倫敎電英純金每盎司續縮一便士所致云、</p>
<p>現鈔需用驟增　貼現突高二元外</p>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、突然勗騰、因需求現金者日多、現鈔需途因之驟增、供方扳價所致、每千元初即做高至三十五元以上、後更步高、絕無回顧、達三十七元半、最後三十七元二角半、比上週六高起二元二角五分云、</p>

<p>滙市昨以洋行界因月底已屆、故油洋行德士古曁英美烟公司結款浩繁、無如外商銀行如滙豐等湧塞維持、目外電亦稍有供售、此外紗花帮略吸期貨美滙、故市况甚形平庸、唯成交尚旺、至港滙雖洋行與外銀行扒結、但以錢兌業及華僑供塞亦殷、致為狀亦始終乏變、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期再縮〇六二五、遠期仍平、紐約銀價亦仍呆定、倫教生金縮一辦士、滙兌英對美大二厘一、對法長三生丁、對滬未更、美對英升二五、對法漲一二五、對滬小八分、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行晨開賣價英滙八辦士一二五、美滙十五元八七五、較上週六午收均平、開後市况頗形沉寂、僅略有各國貨幣買賣、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉續降二五、計徵百分之七·五〇、此後油洋行德士古曁英美烟公司突來互相扒結、但以外銀行仍肯供給、故潛勢缺乏變化、德士古與英美烟公司結進滙豐英金八辦士一二五、兼扒結華比某行美滙十五元八七五、繼之紗花帮吸進華比·有利三月份美滙十五元八一二五、是以過程仍平、近午外行華義吸進錢兌業港滙五十四元三七五、為狀亦平、午收銀行賣價與晨開無異、</p>
<p>後市首由有利吸進滙豐英金八辦士一二五、繼之外電售予某行美滙十五元八七五、最後洋行扒結華僑港滙五十四元三七五，是以過程毫無精彩、晚收銀行賣價英匯八辦士一二五、美匯十五元八七五、結果較上週六午後、英美兩滙俱無榮辱、港滙亦無升降、</p>

<p>上週六英純金跌一便士、英美滙兌升二五、外匯英美烟公司德士古火公司等、結款甚殷、外銀行代「華北聯合準備銀行」扒進亦多、惟港電時有拋塞、銀行供給甚暢、市價維持不更、勢甚穩定、烚赤津帮吸收未懈、金號錢兌業等代殷富搜羅不巳、市價續向高峯猛進、惟倫敦純金連日下降、香港金價祇合二千一百九十元、巳達金價輸送點、私運未能合算、故出籠紛起、恐漲風已達高度、全日交易旺盛、獲利頗多、皆笑逐顏開、外幣英美金鎊、隨金價激漲、狂升元許、殷富竭力搜羅、視為無上珍品、惟金幣稀少、供給困難、乃收藏各金票、致市價多趨上升、惟滙票穩定、故上升尚微、全日交易狂盛、趨勢堅挺、公會成交絕稀、僅新泰出長泰進英金票三十鎊、昨日市價、英金鎊升七角、英金票升九分、美金鎊升一元、美金票升一分八厘、香港票升半分、法郎票升七毫牛、新加坡票升一分、安南票升半分、加拿大票升三分、斐律濱票升一分、德金票升五分、澳金票升一角、僅羅比票荷蘭票義金票暹羅票未更、</p>

<p>紗市趨疲、且跌風益熾、良以實需自紅盤開始以來、各帮皆無活動氣欽、因之一般浮戶、鑒於實際消化不良、兼之海防運輸、對終棉布棉紗暫不裝運、因該處怡和太古等堆棧及外商經營之倉庫堆存貨物、業已滿坑滿谷、後批裝去之貨、絕無容納之處、因此各輪止裝等待疏通後、再當照常戰運、於是揑手之紗、稍現不安之狀態、故開盤時跌勢益見劇烈、最低價至三百九十元巳跌過去年二月十三日之低價、為三百九十一元矣、然同業某某等及金融界皆在多頭地位、且時期尚在春銷旺檔之際、價格如遇跌落時、復來拉提甚力、因此每日開低收高、午後因雲甫帮略為活動採辦、人心重振、再漲二三元、雙馬現貨價為三百九十六元云、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、因環境不良、客帮實需依然呆滯如故、同時海肪暫時不能裝貨、浮多求售尤急、賣氣驟濃、開價即跌四元半、二十支雙馬價為三百九十元、棧單價為三百八十七元、繼以多方鑒於如斯之跌、形勢未免太烈、復來拉提、市價微見回升、二十支雙馬現紗價再到三百九十二元、午後廣帮代雲南帮辦去幾百包、人氣轉趨高翔、市態轉弱為强、結果全日成交統計一千五百十五包、仍以同行交易占一半以上、行情二十支雙馬比上日價漲一元半、雙地球漲一元、天女漲二元、特金城平、棉紗出口今日有四十件運烟台、一百件運天津、八十五件運汕頭、又昨日由天津來紗五百件、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>日紗市塲、仍少生氣、蓋以實銷依然滯印之故也、紗市塲、仍少生氣、蓋以實銷依然滯鈍之故也，但大戶仍在多頭地位、二十支水月現紗價為三百二十八元、二十支藍鳳現紗價為三百二十五元、午後市價稍回好、</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日較呈活躍、唯祇有新生及申新二廠略有交易、餘廠均尚未開手、衆料大批交易、將在下週云、昨日新生廠訂購印棉一千包、計白洛區五百包、合送廠價為七十二元、又奧默拉五百包、送廠價為六十六元五角、申新進五號白洛區現貨一百包、送廠價為六十九元、日廠方面、因近日紗價不振、故對於外棉之採辦、並不踴躍、咋日祗有大康進印棉五百包、公大進印棉五百包、內外廠印棉五百包、餘廠均無動靜、茲將昨日棉價計算如下、</p>

<p>豆餅繼續飛俏、蓋因客餅如常州之協豐兀隆餅·溥利之肥字餅·已告無存、來源又不接、而廠餅亦紙大有餘廠一家供應、所以市氣鋒銳、昨由厦門泉州兩帮採去七八千片、價為三元三角六分、比上週六驟漲六分、共勢尚無稍戢之狀、</p>

<h3 id="c127">貧病 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>貧病二字，一般人時常連用在一起；貧與病，似乎有着密切的連繫關係。</p>
<p>的確，這貧與病兩者，事實上，亦確有難解難分的速繁關係在；有時簡真是當作一個二位一體的專門名詞應用着。</p>
<p>因貧而致病，這是很習見的事；因病而貧，亦是自然的因果。貧者不但易於致病，亦且病了不易治愈：病了因為能使貧者益貧，往往就因有病無醫的結果，而斷送病人的生命，同時也斷送r病者一家的生路。貧與病，其相互的關係，有如此者。</p>
<p>所謂貧，是指經濟上的不充裕或缺乏而言，病呢，就是違反了正常的生理健康，或稱異常的病理。處理治療道項違反了正常的生理健康，就是醫藥。然處治疾病的醫藥，非錢莫辦。因此，富人病人，有的是錢，處治病體的醫藥，是不成什麼問題；貧民病r，就成了問題了。什麼間題？還不是顯然地「經濟問題」！沒有錢的代價，便得不到處治病體的醫藥呀！這，想來就是病在富人不成問題，病在貧民，便成了問題的緣由；想來也便是致使貧病二字如此的相互關係着的原因。</p>
<p>非但在字眼上，彼此有如此相互的連繫關係，實際上，「貧病」也成為社會問題中的一個切重問題哩，</p>
<p>你看，社會上不是有「救濟貧病」這一個呼聲嗎？</p>
<p>接着，我們醫界中也就有所謂「擾待貧病」，「貧病减費」，「貧病免費」等等的應聲。</p>
<p>然而救濟貧病的呼聲雖高，而受救濟的貧病的實益並不顯；優待貧病的辦法固美，而貧病者所得的實惠亦極微。原因何在？在乎救病已難，救貧更難，「貧」才是貧病者的實際病原，貧病者的病之不易愈，已是專實，愈後叉因貧而易於冉病，也是事實。所以在目前這種情形的社會組織之下，「救濟貧病」與「優待貧病」，都非解决貧病的根本方法；可是在此經濟練鎖的現社會組織之下，却又不得不需要這種雖不澈底，然聊勝於無的辦法存在。</p>
<p>所以，在目前的社會中「救濟貧病」這類辦法，固然少不了仍要繼續的保留下去，醫界裏的「優待貧病等應聲口號，也照例的存在着。</p>
<p>不消說，「貧病」二字，也將隨着現社會的存在而永永的繼續着應用下去。</p>

<h3 id="c128">防疫學上的堅壁淸野（下） <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 姜振勛</p>
<p>不過關於防疫部份，那就不同，只要大家切實去做，無論堅壁，無論清野，都可以得到澈底的成績，歐美各國的先例，不是可稱鐵證嗎？這因為普通一般所該講究的衛生問題，頭緒紛繁，不免顧此失彼，而防疫方面，雖疫的種類也千差萬別。可是成疫的原因，總不外乎病菌，凡屬病菌概有1定的通性，要知道病菌的通性，就不難相當對付。這種通性可分二點，第一病菌入人體。初起因為體內未生抵抗力，果然不免要受其害，或者病倒，或者甚至於死，但病而不死，那麼體內就產生抗毒素，反把細菌消滅，不獨這病漸次復元，並且第二次冉遇同種細菌來侵害時，就有所恃而無恐了。所以耍免病菌侵害，最好先發一次輕病。第二病菌的生活，總是以病人身體為依歸，倘使離r病人，就不會發育也不易繁殖，所以疫症傳染的根源，全重在已病的病人。倘使整個環境中，根本沒有這類疫症的病人，那就無所怕其傳染了。總而言之，防疫的問題，比一般的衛生為簡單，吾們紙須針對着那二點病菌的共通性去設法，自不難達理想中的目的。就是一方面，大家想法去染一次輕病。讓體內發生相當抗毒素，達到堅壁的功効；另一方面，大家努力清野，把已病的人掃除，那自不致傳染害人了，雖然，二方面似乎互相反對，為堅壁的，希望染病，為清野的，獨忌染病，豈非大相矛盾嗎，其實不然，以上所述不過理論，若認真依照防疫學上去實行，自有正當途抨，不致互相矛盾，下文不妨更進一步，把防疫學上實用的堅壁清野方法。說些大概。</p>
<p>想利用染一次輕病，發生相當抗毒素，去達堅壁目的，吾們中國古法補痘，早就如此的，不過痘固可種，別種傳染病却未必可種，况且種痘以後的發病，也不一定輕·有時竟有因此犧牲生命的，所以現在防疫學上已經放棄，像古法種痘，把生機活潑的細菌引入人身，完全和自然傳染，一般無異，宜乎流弊多而危險性大。現在吾們所種的痘，改用牛痘苗，內容並非天花的生活細菌，而用牛痘的細菌製造的。雖然種這牛痘以後所產生的抵抗力，有效的期間沒有像古法種痘的久長，可是實際上確屬毫無流弊，决不會再有意外危險可慮。至於其他疫症，雖沒有條天花，可用牛痘細菌去代巷，但是現在研究進步，知道也可用死的病菌，去引起組織的反應，而產生抗毒素，和生活細菌毫無差別。如此就像霍亂菌，傷寒菌，腦膜炎菌，鼠疫菌，白喉菌，猩紅熱菌，都可照樣種一下。雖方法和種痘有些不同，種痘時祇須把細菌種在皮層之內就了事，而死的細菌，必須種在皮膚以下，才能有效。所以要利用注射方法注入的。可是道種注入皮下的不過手續上有不同吧了，其結局也同樣引起反應發生抗毒素，同樣可以抵禦活菌的侵害。這樣看來，現在應用死的病菌去達堅壁的目的，一些沒有和清野的工作有所矛盾。</p>
<p>至於清野工作，重在掃除已病的病人，在防疫學上，也規定着很妥當的辦法，就是現在全世界所通行的隔離法，由地方機關負責辦理。在平日，隨時隨刻，注意着類似疫症的病人，遇有可疑，就立刻把牠隔離起，不但患病本人，送到隔離的病院去檢查去調治，並且病人的家族和瞵居，也一律須和社會隔絕，無論是人是物，一概不許和外人交通，一定要經過環境的消毒，和各人種過牛痘或注射過相當的死菌，等他抗毒素發生了，才許自由呢，這豈不是可靠底的清野法嗎？照此推演起來，在防疫學上，對終堅壁清野二端，的確要比一般普通衛生容易澈底。可惜吾們中國，因為科學常識還沒有普及，什麼種痘，什麼注射，大家都視若畏途，對於隔離的辦法，要把病人和關係人像囚犯般與世隔絕，更望之生懼，或許還認為不近情理，以致疫症隨之流行·最近上海，不是被人家目為天花港嗎？如果人人肯認真種痘，和患天花的病人，個個都肯進隔離醫院，那麼天花的疫勢，早已消减，天花港的壞名譽，也不致宣揚了，因為感想到此，所以借着本刊，把真相來宣佈一下，希望大家趕快依照防疫學上堅壁清野方法，去實行，桑榆的收獲，也不為晚呢。</p>

<p>— 劉永純</p>
<p>本刊承讀者諸君來信詢卡介苗B.C.G.情形甚詳，茲特撮要答復於下。</p>
<p>（一）卡介苗為法國微生物專家卡默特敎授Calmette及其同事介蘭先生C.Gnerin所發明，卡介二氏用一牛類結核菌，經二十餘年之特殊培養，使其無致病能力，而保存免疫作用。</p>
<p>（二）現在上海巴斯德研究院製造此苗（現僅限於口腔用者一種）　免昆山供給醫師之用，但非醫師不給。</p>
<p>（三）上海廣慈醫院一年來，已接種嬰孩八百餘人，成績甚好</p>
<p>（四）中國用此不田者不僅上海一處，重慶王良先生製此苗而用之者巳六七年。</p>
<p>（五）卡介苗口腔接種之法非常簡單，嬰孩出世後十日內，隔一日（出世後第三日第五日第七日或第四日第六日第八日均可）早間授乳之前半小時，以卡介苗田與溫乳調勻而使嬰孩飲之，每次一安瓿，共服三次，但此法僅能用於初生十日內之嬰孩，年長者用之鮮效。</p>
<p>（六）年長者須用皮下接種之法，此項接種手續較繁，而接種後有時作冷性化膿，但此種化膿無危險性，且往往無須醫藥而自愈。</p>
<p>（七）接種無論口腔皮下，皆須醫師親手為之，接種之前後受接種者往往須受隔離，並由醫帥用結核菌素作皮膚反應，（按此項反應在含結核菌者為陽性）視反應之結果，而定適當之處置。</p>
<p>（八）此苗在動物身上試騐無應數萬次，人類之受接種者巳逾二百萬人，用此苗者，僉謂其無害而有效。</p>

<h3 id="c132">權利淺說 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>一般人的常情，總喜歡享權利而不大肯盡義務，於是遇到權利，在所必爭，遇到義務，在所必避。在他們的心裏，總局認爲享權利是樂事，盡義務是苦事，而不知享權利固然有可樂之處，而盡義務更有極其難得的至樂；更不知權利就是義務，義務便是權利。</p>
<p>古人說，爲善最樂，西洋聖經上也說，幫助人最快樂。而爲善，連幫助人在內，便是一般人所說的義務。因此心涼民是樂事，就得到古聖先賢證明。假使你不信，你儘可以試試；假使你信而不明其所以然，你更可以試試。凡事身歷其境，便能了銀其究竟，也就不煩我的辭費了。</p>
<p>權利決不是天上掉下來的；義務也決不會使人白盡的。二者互爲因果，廣義地說來，本來是二而一，一而二的東西。我現在來不及詳細說明　他們，先舉出服兵役這一件事，來證實義務更是權利的說法。</p>
<p>服兵役，在苦干陳腐的腦筋裏，總以爲是苦差使，爲了有性命的關係，總以爲比了任何義務都可怕，一定不能與權利相比。可是，現在一般國家的憲法上，雖規定當兵是義務，但學說上却認當兵是國民的權利。旣然不以當兵爲義務而爲權利，所以不容外國人來享受，正如不容外國人來享受置產等權利一樣。</p>
<p>我們也儘可避開法理不談，而僅就事實着想。强盜　打進你的家裏，來搶奪你的財產，欺侮你的家人，你要拚命保護這一切，這固然是你的義務，但這義務你願意別人來居了你的地位替你盡否？即小可以喻大，一國也就等於一家，你及你的子弟要爲國家服兵役，那當然就是在享受權利，而非盡義務了，因爲不是外國人所能公然居了你的地位來替代你的。</p>
<p>個人與國家，在現代本來已成爲息息相通，休戚與共的一體。保護國家即所以保護自己，大家都已耳熟能詳。特別提出來說，這是我們的權利，在我們的心理上，要有樂於享受的準備和實行。</p>
<h3 id="c133">兒童團 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>游擊區內的情形，正有許多，看了足以使人精神鼓舞，認爲我國的抗戰絕對可以佔勝，我國的民族絕對可以復興。其中使人印象最深的，我可以說就是兒童團。</p>
<p>在某游擊區裏，從八歲到十五歲的兒童，大都加入「兒童團」主持的「教練」是正式遊擊隊裏派來的，他們不但有軍事知識，也有一般的常識。他們先從鄉村入手，大些的一個鄉村，或一個市鎭，小些的兩三個鄉村，大約能招集到五六十外兒童，就組成一小隊。幾個小隊併成一個中隊，幾個中隊併成一個大隊，統隷屬於「司令部」之下。</p>
<p>隊員的加入是出位於自願的，並不勉强。但旣經加入之後，便不能隨便脫離。每一個隊員，每天有兩三個銅板的「餉」，隊長要多些，五個十個不等。不時還有糖菓和大餅等犒賞，假使操得很好或者打了「勝仗」。加入之後，如果中途要脫離，一切的「餉」和犒賞，便要那個兒童的家長賠償。</p>
<p>隊員的武器是木槍，木棍，竹棒，以及其他任何適當的東西。但是隊長等人，也有「槍」；這槍用子彈的銅管，塞滿火藥，底下穿一小孔，以通藥綫，綁在短棒上製成。不過這東西只能够作爲號令，或壯壯聲勢，不能對了人放，因爲太近了也容易使人受重傷。</p>
<p>隊員的工作，第一是「上講堂」，第二是「上操塲」，第三是「上戰塲」。</p>
<p>有些是每天晚上，有些是一天衛一天的晚上，所有的隊員，都要到指定的廣塲上，或田間，或墳間，或山野之處，集合起來，由教練訓話：報告時事近狀，說明兒童團的使命等事。訓話完畢，就開始操練。完全是軍事操練，並非小學校裏的普通操練。此外當然還教唱歌。有月光最好，否則就燃起油松來做火把。</p>
<p>最重要的是實行戰鬥。先由這隊與那隊的教練民，預先約好，在那一天那一時彼此開戰。到了那一天那一時，大都在夜間，兩隊就各自出發。「衝鋒隊」在前面，大隊在後面，其他偵察，埋伏等事，也應有盡有。因此一方面鬥力，一方面也就是鬥智。</p>
<p>兩隊接觸的時候，雙方都可以用手裏的武器，攻打「敵人」。當然，不用武器而用拳頭脚尖，扭作一團的「打仗」。尤其普遍。打痛了不許哭喊，打得衣破鞋落，頭破血流了，不許家長出來說話。那一隊被「繳械」了，或者那一隊逃走了，就算輸，得勝的一隊便帶着「戰利品」唱歌回來。</p>
<p>爲了時常也有小小的流血等事，所以隊中也有救護隊，有着救需要的用物和知識。</p>
<p>兒童都懂得他們爲什麼要這樣「打仗」，他們的家長更其曉得這樣「打仗」的意義，一言以弊之，就是準備對付他們眞正的敵人；所以自從去年秋天發起以來，到現在已經有大半年，各處地方，「打仗」已不知多少次，有些稱意的頭上手上，疤痕重重，身上的衣服，破綻曼曼，他們自己都不畏縮，他們的家長也都不阻止，更沒有發生過什麼不愉快的糾紛。</p>
<p>他們在白天，有時也有集合的遊行。隊伍排得很整齊，唱着「軍歌」，在市鎭上走着。有些大膽的，甚至遊行到離城二三里的地方，看見他們眞正的敵人出現時，他們就將「武器」向地下一丟，散了開來嬉戲着，敵人看見了他們，也不知道他們在作些什麼，又因爲都是兒童，也只好聽由他們去。</p>
<p>除了正式的集合，加緊訓練以外，他們在家，一有空，還要集合着幾個鄰兒，各自作着單獨的操練，例如摜跤，打沙袋，跳高，跳遠等事。</p>
<p>總之，這些兒童，除了他們在家庭或學校間的正常服務以外，更受着澈底而積極的軍事訓練。他們現在雖然年幼，但是一轉眼間就是壯丁，等到成了壯丁，因爲從小受過這樣的訓練，要他們打游擊或加入正規軍，就非常便利了。八路軍和四路軍中的「小鬼」，可以說就是這樣的兒童。不過「小鬼」是脫離家庭的，完全是「小兵」，他們是在家的，預備將來當兵，就有這一些不同。</p>
<p>這是我所知道的某游擊區某縣某鎭的事情。我不曉得別鎭別縣別區是怎樣。但我相信，主定定是有通盤計劃的，別的地方總也在一樣進行吧。</p>
<p>很好，敵人是在和我們結下累安然仇，就讓我們結報下去吧。「兒童團」就是報這仇的出發點。</p>
<p>看了昨天的「出發」，未免爲天眞的兒童惋惜。但看了今天的「兒童團」，又使我們爲他們高興了。並且「出發」的人數究竟少，「兒童團」的人數究竟多，而「出發」的不是願意的，所以我們對位於我們未來的戰士，只有充份的樂觀。——編者。</p>

<h3 id="c135">勸人爲善 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 君佩</p>
<p>基督教的牧師最不願意聽人家說他們是勸人爲善的。他們說，勸人爲善，不過勸而已矣，其人爲善不爲善，與勸者無關，勸者盡其勸之能事，就不作別事。他們自命在勸之外，有埸進一步的工作，他們說，他們在引人爲善，甚至拉人爲善。</p>
<p>我們在社會上所常見的勸人爲善者，則大槪有下列三種：</p>
<p>第一種是吃十方飯的僧道。他們在「勸」之下，加一個「化」，化者化緣也。於是「善」就成了「出錢爲功德」，任是罪大惡極之徒，只要一聽他拉的勸，多多佈施，立刻可以成爲無疵的羔羊。第二種是嫖賭吃著無所不爲的敗落子弟，一至老來，受盡苦楚，甚至乞食爲生，他們往往會對他們的子弟——假使有——或任何後輩，深自懺悔，勸人爲善，不要學他們的榜樣，來博取人家的憐憫。第三種是已經成爲老闆的流氓光棍。他們在一條褲子一根繩的時代，無惡不作，一朝高升而開老虎灶，澡堂子，或者更進而從事什麼大企業，就會勸人爲善，暗示他們的「善有善報」，呌人對於他們的財產或地位，勿作非份之想，分一杯羹。</p>
<p>第一種，自己一無所有，想靠勸人爲善吃飯。第二種，自己本來不無所有，現在已經光了，想靠勸人爲善來茍延殘喘。第三種，自己本來也一無所有，現在略有或大有所得，想靠勸人爲善來維持現狀。總而言之，勸人爲善也者，要飽自己的肚皮也。</p>
<p>這些按下慢表，不料近來世界上花樣翻新，又有了另外一種的勸人爲善。加人在那裏吃飯，他去奪了來說，這飯中有毒，我來代你倒去吧，而他私下却將奪來的飯咽下了肚子。別人好好地睡在屋子裏，他來趕走了，說，强盜就要來了，我來代你把守吧，而他私下却將屋子裏的東西一槪偷了去。別人在和朋友往來，他却說，這朋友是靠不住的，硬要阻斷他們的往來，而他自己却和那位朋友依然往來不絕。諸如此類的行爲，很多很多，眞所謂罄竹難盡。但是他總對別人說，我是要你好，保護你，使你平安，享福，我是你的最好朋友。</p>
<p>其初創　也不過爲了要飽自己的肚子，所以有這些勸人爲善的舉動。但是這些舉動，却遠非僧道，敗落子弟，以及流氓光棍可比，因爲僧道等所用的方法還是軟的，而他所用的，却是硬的。被僧道所勸的，不聽也就罷了，僧道等無奈之何，而被他所勸的，簡直受寵若驚，啼笑皆非，有不能不聽之勢。他早就超出了「勸」的範圍，而入於「拉」的地步了。他眞有基督教牧師的「熱心」。</p>
<p>然而，僧首也，敗家子弟也，流氓光棍也，其他種種也，他們的所勸，甚至所拉，假吏誰聽從了他們，的確也可以爲善，不像這個另有一功的勸人並且拉人爲「善」者，誰聽了他誰就倒霉，要弄得死無葬身之地。這就難怪被「勸」者不聽而被「拉」者要出以抗拒了。他到底不是在勸人爲「善」，而是在「勸」人爲「惡」！</p>
<p>年了這種情形，不能不使人慨嘆：天下事眞是愈出愈奇了。不過僧道等人，勸人爲善，畢竟還有人性，人類間還可以有生存的餘地，而這種勸人爲惡的人，簡直是無比的巨魔，人類間遲早總是要與以剷除的吧！</p>

<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>民族小說話</p>
<p>「雙鳳奇緣」是以昭君和番爲題材的小說。關於王昭君的文藝實在太多了。即以胡丹鳳所編的「靑塚志」而論，詠王昭君的詩就有四百多首。變文方面有「明妃傳」。戲劇方面也有元雜劇四種：馬致遠的「漢宮秋」，關漢卿的「哭昭君」，張時起的「昭君出塞」，以及吳昌齡的「夜月走昭君」。可惜除了「漢宮秋」以外，已經全佚了。明淸傳奇則有「和戎記」和「靑塚記」，以及周文泉的「琵琶語」明淸雜劇則有陳與郊的「昭君出塞」，（收入盛明雜劇初集者實爲「昭君出塞」，張弓的「王昭君」誤以爲「和戎記」，見嶺南學報二卷二期）尤侗的「弔琵琶」和薛旦的「昭君夢」。後二種收入「雜劇新編」，振鐸在前年曾發現「新編」全帙。以上各種戲劇曾經張壽林的「王昭君故事演變之點點滴滴」，（燕京大學文學年報第一期）和黃綮琇的「王昭君故事的演變」（廣洲中山大學民俗週刊第一二一期）列舉過，惟另有鼓晚出的「雙鳳緣」傳奇似寫諸家所未學。這種傳奇玉霜簃有藏鈔本。劇學月刊上杜穎陶的「記玉霜簃所藏鈔本戲曲」云：『雙鳳緣，一冊，不分卷，未錄作者姓名，演王昭君事，與坊間通行之「雙鳳奇緣」小說同。原共上下二卷，此本衹存上卷，共二十齣，至李陵抄斬毛延壽家屬而止，下卷缺。』大約此劇是「雙鳳奇緣」以後所編成的了。</p>
<p>小說方面似僅「雙鳳奇緣」一種，孫楷第的「中國通俗小說目」失載，凡八十回，張壽林以爲當刊於淸季中葉，有通行本。此書多取「漢宮秋」「和戎記」以及「靑塚記」而略加更改。</p>
<p>「如漢宮秋寫昭君自彈琵琶，爲元帝聽見，」因此得寵。小說則改爲被林皇后聽見，再由皇後千訴元帝，多添一層波折。漢宮秋唱句云：「點得這一寸秋波玉有瑕。」小說則云「每張畫圖眼下點了芝蔴大一粒黑痣。」</p>
<p>和戎記說昭君自己畫像，小說同。和戎記說宮人蕭善音代昭君出嫁，小說同，惟地宮人名字。和戎記寫昭君死後託夢，要元帝討她的妹妹王秀貞，小說亦同，只是把王秀貞的名字改成賽　昭君罷了。</p>
<p>靑塚記現僅存出塞送昭兩齣，最近仙霓社傳茗和華傳浩還表演過好幾次，舞姿甚好。此據有御弟王龍送昭君，小說也因襲了這種說法，衹是把王龍改成劉文龍（與小上墳主角同名）轉了。</p>
<p>如此說來，雙鳳奇緣亦部小說可以說是集吃小說可以說是集傳說的大成了。</p>

<p>腎虧是夫婦間愛情的蟊賊，壽命的縮短使者</p>
<p>婚後男子一有腎虧症，夫婦間的愛情沒有不大其受影響，因爲夫婦是性關係的結合，一個精力豐沛的男子娶了一個健美多姿的女郎，沒有不度其甜蜜的生活的。因此夫婦愛情濃厚，生育着伶俐而健壯的子女，組織着美滿而快樂的家庭，這是多麼的幸福呀！要是男子有了腎虧，精力渙散的病症，那夫婦生活就無從圓滿，他們的愛情沒有不大受打擊的，我們在近來的報章雜誌中，或是茶餘酒後的談話間，時常的可以聽到看到關於夫婦糾紛或法院離婚的案件中，因爲丈夫的不能人道，妻子蹉跎靑春，不堪犧牲說得振振有詞的事實，此外丈夫腎虧症的放任不治，致身體日慚衰弱，一病鳴呼！遺下孤兒寡妻於不顧者，據某醫師所作靑年丈夫死亡統計與究研中，亦有大可駭人的數字！所以婚後男子的腎虧一症，實爲當今醫家大可注意一的個嚴重問題。</p>
<p>爲何男子婚後多腎虧症？其原因大都爲男子於春情發動期多自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾之故，至於用腦過度或工作斵傷，先天衰弱或病後失調等原因亦間或有之。此症在輕微時，在外表上每無甚異狀，繼之常與神經衰弱，新陳代謝機能減退諸種症象相伴而來，因此，時覺頭腦脹痛，健忘失眠，耳鳴眼花，腰酸背痛，滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，面黃肌瘦，怕寒畏熱，精神萎靡等症象即相繼而來，終日困頓在憂鬱與疲備之中，生活之痛苦，殊難以言喻！</p>
<p>關於此症的最對症而特效的療法，據世界名醫及余多年經騐，均一致推頌生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，因此劑係根據事實需要，由無數的世界醫藥專家，竭其畢生經騐，相互研究實騐，始由雄壯動物如猿猴猩猩等體中提取生殖腺素製成藥劑，結果始獲却病延年，返老返童之效，以是震驚於代的世界醫壇，對於此劑發明最具功績者，爲歐洲生理學大家斯丹那博士，所以此劑即以「斯丹那氏生殖素」名之。誠以此藥品質純粹，藥性王道，補力積極，服後於一日夜間即能生精祉腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，促進新陳代謝機能，而絕無刺澈腸胃，興奮神經等副作用，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，并可延年益壽，惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速，若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3 id="c140">遺精失治的悲哀與必要挽救 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>每個男子。在靑春時期最易犯的弊病，無疑地是手淫，手淫這樣毛病，說起來雖很簡單而可鄙。但靑年一經沾玩以後。極易變成習慣。習慣旣成，於是正似吸煙上了癮，雖知其害而終不能澈底戒除。因其不能澈底戒除，由是靑春腺首受摧殘，精關松弛，繼起的便是遺精。</p>
<p>遺精從健康上講，他是危害腦，性，脊髓三大神經最厲害的，所以靑年一旦患有此種惡症以後，思考力便急遽衰退。同時記憶不良。腰痠背痛，耳鳴心悸，夜眠盜汗等症叢生，而尤其覺得可怕者，發育機能大受打擊，性器的短小一如童稚，更有因精關開闔過頻，精囊括約筋松弛而突發滑精，漏精，因而引起陽萎早洩等症者，此種靑年，不特對於自身的健康與偉大的前途，均得遭遇劇烈的打擊，即於夫婦間的兩性生活上，亦每因不能盡責應付而爲妻所憎恨！於是內疚於心，外制於妻，羞愧惱恨！其痛苦殆非筆墨言語所能形容也！</p>
<p>關於本症的挽救方法，第一患者須淸心寡慾，避免不良的接觸，勤運動，戒絕惡癖，每晚臨睡前以冷水摩擦局部，注意排尿，並服『希米脫氏固精片』四片以固精關，則遺精自可於當晚立止，如因遺洩過頻而有上述各種衰弱症象者，則應同時兼服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，因該劑係提取獅，虎，猩猩，海狗等之生殖腺素，更和以珍貴的礦植物質，經過科學的方法，監製而成，故服後一日夜間，即能生精補腎，健腦益髓，如能繼續服用，持之以恒。則雖極虧弱的身體，與極兇惡的遺精，滑精，均能在短期內，澈底治愈。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>健美的乳峯是時代婦女必要的條件</p>
<p>在女性的胸前，有着一雙高聳的乳峯，的確有助於女性健美的增進，生育子女的把握以及哺育子女的便利。那末，提倡乳峯的發達，實有無上的價值，時代的輪子是前進的，女性乳峯的發達，這是時代前進的例證，我們應一致的贊同并努力以輔助她們的成功！可是積重難返，我們所見的人性，大都是乳　顏瘦，呈未老先衰狀態，因此，略有些新智識的婦女，如何使乳峰健美？的確已成了一個普遍而重要的問題。我們在醫學上的論斷，乳峯的特別發達，爲女性生理上的特徴，這種生理上特徴的發達，是根據於婦女性生理上的特徴，這種生理上特徴的發達，是根據婦女的卵巢機能。如果卵巢機能健全，那不特乳峯會自然的聳起來，就是臀部亦必發達，聲調亦呈婉轉而優美，性情亦呈溫和而多情，同時新陳代謝作用亦必旺盛，在皮膚，肌肉，血液等部分，均充滿着新生細胞，因此皮膚白嫩，肌肉豐腴，血液充盈而鮮紅在面部就泛起　了桃花，無須脂粉，已美麗非常，年齡難增，可長駐靑春，夫婦生活，必甜蜜非常，生育着伶俐而健壯的子女，組織着快樂而美滿的家庭，這是多麼幸福的女性呀！可是因過去束胸，或有白帶，不感，月經不調等隱疾的婦女，卵巢機能必受其摧殘，遂致乳痛而顏衰，生育無望，夫婦愛情淡薄，她的命運必悲慘之至！唯一補救辦法，即服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」以增補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，則乳峯於句日內即可聳起，上述隱疾可一量肅淸，誠爲增進健美却除疾病的唯一婦科良藥也。</p>

<p>近來一般市醫，對林病學上所宣稱的似乎僅僅一種，這一種的宣傳就是徧重於療法方面。但是要根本解決淋病，必須履行下列的三個條件，才是實說：</p>
<p>（一）醫家本身的學識和經騐！</p>
<p>（二）設備宜周密並宜隨時代而進展！</p>
<p>（三）病家宜信賴有聲譽而負責的專家！</p>
<p>能履行上列三個條件，則一切淋病，不愁無解決。第一條件，醫家如能有豐富的醫學上的知識，更有豐富的臨床經騐，而具有嶄新的腦筋，庶幾不因多年臨床上的經騐而自　，否則經騐愈多，頭腦愈舊，不肯吸收新知識，而成爲時代的落伍者。此種醫家，並不足貴。第二條件，是設備方面　，現在因科學進步，一日千里，在淋病治療上的設備，自宜採用最進步的醫械。此方面余每考察歐美各大醫院新設備，而年有增購最新的醫械。例如顯微鏡，膀胱鏡等醫械，必每年更換。以促增診斷上的效能。第三條件，凡肯負責任而聲譽素孚的醫家，病家宜信服勿渝。能遵以上所說淋病絕對可以治愈。這就是根治淋病的秘訣。凡是患急慢性淋，如　護腺炎，膀胱炎，前後尿道炎，睪丸炎，關節炎等，則除去用最新醫械行精細檢查診，一方必須有德國濾淋平流電療法，德國希氏血淸，冷電法，各號晋齊，自家菌苗等，均可對症施行，少則二星期，多至五星期左右，卽可十愈其十。</p>

<h3 id="c143">上海的銀行業 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 調查員</p>
<p>上海是全國的經濟中心，所以金融事業較其他各地來得發達。上海的銀行業，因此很興旺。</p>
<p>上海的銀行，有外國人經營的，也有本國人經營的。本篇所述，則限於後者，所謂「內國」銀行是也。</p>
<p>上海的內國銀行的歷史，不若錢莊業那麼的攸久。到現在，祇不過四十二三一年光景。在光緒二十三年（西曆一八九）七年），上海外國銀行成立者已很多，那時絻由盛宜懷發起創立中國通商銀行。所以上海之有本國人自辦的新式金融機關，當以中國通商銀行為嚆矢。光緒三十一年（一九〇五年）中國銀行的前身戶部銀行（即大清銀行的前身）上海分行設立後，上海纔有國家銀行的出現。後來四川，信成，信義，浙江與業，四明，及郵傳部奏請設立的交通銀行先後成立分設，h海的內國銀行業，於是而形興盛。據統計：上海自民國以來，銀行的成立或分設者，總數不下二百餘家之多。可惜其中大一半因為主觀條件的不健全，和客觀環境的困難，不免倒閉或收歇。但現存者尚有百餘家之多。</p>
<p>上海各銀行的資本額，有多有少，最多的有在五百萬以上，最少的有五十萬。按照銀行條例：實收資本四分之一，便可設立，所以過去有幾家銀行，收有資本十萬，二十萬之後，便大事鋪張，開始營業了。為了道，卜海的銀行業，有時期，曾遭遇過悲慘的命運。原因是：有一般「聰明朋友，利用銀行的招牌，以高利來吸收儲款，以儲款來經營投機事業，結果，當然逃避不了他中觀失敗的因素，而宜吿倒閉，宣吿清理了。弄得那時節銀行業的信譽，受到極大的影響；一般小額儲戶，甚至有因一生辛苦所得的血汗，葬送在他們冒臉的行為之中，而痛悔貪圖厚利，自盡喪命的實繁有徒。雖說那　「聰明」朋友，並非存心施行詐術，然而冒險的結果，成功了是自已的，失敗了却「拿人家的頭皮來研漿」，究屬有背商人的道德啊。</p>
<p>上海的銀行，有國家銀行，若中央，中國，交通，農民·中國銀行是專營國際滙兌的，交通和農民是專營特許營業的。有商辦銀行，商辦銀行的營業性質，則可分為：地方的，商業的，儲蓄的，農工的，分業的，等類。</p>
<p>上海的商辦銀行，在過去因為營業方針的錯誤，大都曾陷入苦悶的途境：或因經營地產，或因經營投機——標金，紗花，公債等，而致資金凍結，業務呆滯，到法幣政策實現前，纔得政府扶助，而脫離苦境．不過我們不是說上海的銀行都忘記了救濟農村，扶助工商的工作，我們曉得，上海有不少銀行，對於調劑農村經濟和工商合作放款等事業，也著有相當的成績。</p>
<p>上海的銀行，除中，中，交，通商等設於外灘外，大都鏖集在北京路一帶，它的理由：當然為的是便利業務。然而有許多銀行，為便利顧客和推廣業務起見，在本埠均有二個分支行或辦事處的設立，在四五年前，本埠分行的膨賬狀態，竟有迅速發展的趨勢。這種現象，是好是歹，我們不願多加評述。</p>
<p>上海的銀行，也有同業公會的組織，因為它組織的成員是金融機關，所以在上海佔有很重要的地位，它不但對於本身任務，維護同業的福利，曾有過值得稱述的功績，即對於社會事業的扶植，也具有光榮的紀錄；而於第一期抗戰建國的過程中，更提供不少的勞力，有不可湮沒的勞動。同業公會中也有聯合準備委員會的設立，它的任務和上海錢業準備庫相彷彿的，它曾起過甚大的作用。</p>
<p>上海的銀行從業員，有銀行學會和聯誼會二個業務組織，前者的組織成員是上層行員，後者的組織成員是一般行員。前者是以促進木國銀行界研究銀行學術，及養成銀行業實用人材為宗旨，所以也可算金融輔助機關之一；後者是以聯絡感情，增厚交誼為目的；所以他們在行員本身的學術修養，和社會活動，頗多致力。</p>
<p>上海的銀行員的待遇，雖則也有跟着服務銀行規模的大小，營業的盈虧的或高或低的差別，但在一般商業上說來，是最優良的。不幸八一三的砲火，已將他們安定的，優遇的生活，也轟入苦悶的境地。同樣的，各銀行因為行址的鄰近戰區，和其他原因，為避免不必耍的損失，在八一三之後，會經搬過塲，搬到有異國情調的霞飛路上來，度着戰亂的生活。自從國軍西撤後，一部份雖已搬回老家，一部份却仍在新址營業。</p>
<p>上海已淪為孤島，各銀行的業務，當然不能像過去般的能够自由開展，而致甚形憔悴，然而侵略者的魔火，却不能燒殺上海銀行業的牛命，相反的，上海的銀行業因為這裏的無法拓展，巳投奔到內地去了。那裹正有廣大的銀行投資墾植的園地，而且銀行業已培植起新生的萌芽了！</p>

<p>— （飛馬）</p>
<p>我們都曉得日本的女人是挺多情的，她們服侍丈夫是挺週到的，但是，因為日本這個資本主義社會的體質裏，還包含着濃重的封建氣味，所以日本女人的多情，我們可以這樣說：正是日本女人的致命的悲慘</p>
<p>美國好萊塢的電影公司，曾經抓到日本女人的多情，而拍攝過一張哀艷的影片，呌做「蝴蝶夫人」的，看過那張影片的人，對於日本女人是感到一種怎樣的憧憬呵！這倒並不是想有那麼一個女人來體貼服侍，而是感到人間如果真有那樣的女人的愛，而男子們如果不像那偭美國水手去玩弄一下女人的話，那真是一個怎樣甜美的世界了！</p>
<p>可是這究竟是一種理想，正因為日本女人是過分的多情，所以日本女人是更加悲哀的。自抗戰以來，在報章上，每當我們看到日本女人寫信給她們的在中國從事侵略戰的丈夫的時候，我們問無論怎樣一個偽激的愛國主義者，總是感到日本的女人是多麼的悲慘</p>
<p>「一，二八」的時候，日本的女人會經組織過「索夫團，」道次的「八，一三，」因為限終日本國內新聞封鎖的嚴屬，我們雖然沒有看見過什麼關於日本的女人的消息，然而我們能够想像得出，比「索天團」更為壯烈的事實是一定在日本表演得很多的。不久之前，在上海，有兩個日本兵自縊身死，為的是他們的妻子在上海當了妓女來一安慰」在華作戰的軍士！</p>
<p>日本女人的運命，是悲慘到了這般地步。然而還有更為悲慘的哩，如H咋報上載有東京的電訊一則，說是：一日政府近以在華將士死亡極多，留在國內之寡婦人數遂愈趨愈衆，卹金問題，成為國家經濟重大担負之一，現為减輕此項重担計，乃擬派寡婦三萬人，授以四個月之殖民訓練，送往南美巴西，因巴西境內有日僑二十萬人，而未婚者衆，大可以收容此批寡婦。並聞日本拓殖省，尚擬派遺大批寡婦前往「滿洲國，」日前在國會之預算席上，曾提出每年經費十七萬元之要求，以供移殖寡婦之用云。</p>
<p>我抄了以上一段新聞，並不是對寡婦再蘸有以非難，或則反對，而只是感到：道樣的移殖寡婦，只是加重了日本女人的悲慘運命，這是誰都可以想像得到的！為什麼？因為這種移殖是含有侵略的意味呀！</p>
<p>然則日本女人的運命怎樣來改善呢？這當然是要日本女人自己去考慮了，然而中國抗戰最後勝利獲得之日，也就是日本女人晚離那種悲慘的「移殖」運命的一日！</p>

<p>今天吳君素，真的代替了金澹雲做了嚮導之職。因為何家兩位小姐，第一叵到蘇州來。朱愛人雖然也是蘇州鄉F人，但她一向不注意那些事，因此連蘇州幾個名勝之區，她也不甚了了。所以今大要拖住吳君素，便是這個緣故。吳君素一路指點給伺家兩位小姐看：這是那裹，從前留了什麼勝跡，在什麼時候，游人最多。又指點給她們：這一個地方，巳經荒廢失修，近來由地方上，重行修理過了。向家兩位小姐，在外國時，早聽得人家說：蘇州是東方威尼期的話了。現在她們的汽車，沿着河道而行。却見河中各式各樣的船隻，盡舫游艇，星維棋布。以及岸上人家，水閣凉亭，湘薕書梀，都可以入書。先是何雙玉見了，不覺讀歡道：『江南真是好風景，無怪自古以來的文人詞客，對此歌詠，不絕終口」·何儷玉道：「人家一向說我們珠江華麗，但　　是華麗了，和這裏比較，顯見得是有些兒俗氯了」。吳君素道：「以前說」上有天堂，下有蘇杭一，本來蘇杭兩處是風景區域。實在中國是個最優美的國家，到處都有很好的風景，不獨蘇杭為然。並非我們自己是中國人，阿私所好，凡是歐美到中國來游歷的人，也都如此說。因為中國的地方太好了，便有人來觀覦。那些被攘奪了去的地方，都被他們儘量的作踐。最可笑的，在戰爭時代，起初我們有許多淪陷的地方。及至收回以後，有些大房子，全變成了小房子，東一間，西一間，弄得方向也辨不清楚。還加添了許多木屋，這些木屋，在我們中國是看巷門的，或是站崗的警察可住的咧」。說得大家都笑了起來，吳君素又道：「有一件事，我覺得蘇杭兩處的地方當局，辦得還差强人意。就是那風景佳勝的地方，不許廣告侵入。從前那些商業廣吿，真是强橫而惡劣極了，它總揀風景最好的地方，楠立一塊廣吿牌·而且那種廣吿牌，大半是賣藥的廣吿，又盡得奇形怪狀，醜惡不堪，真正是煞風景的事。我是見了最恨的。現在好了，凡是風景佳體的地方，「槪不許亂豎廣吿牌子」。正是</p>

<p>赫勃馬歇爾和狄娜寳萍合演了「小烏依人」後，春節中在國泰開映的「舞空風月，」他又和克勞黛考爾白合作。赫勃馬歇爾雖不是好萊塢挺漂亮的男星，但是他的外形和演技是頗適合於他所演的角色的。「桃李爭春」中他飾律師史蒂夫，和他任性自私的妻子菁茜離婚後，在華盛頓遇見了瑪麗絲，因情意投洽，他們結婚了。但是史蒂夫的鄉人目為她是破壞史蒂夫家庭的罪魁，常常使瑪麗絲難堪。同時史蒂夫有一個可愛的女兒愛蓮，離婚後由菁茜扶養着。在一個歡宴中，菁茜和瑪麗絲鬧翻了，菁茜忿然欲携愛蓮遠去紐約，史蒂夫因不願愛女遠離，懇菁茜携愛運赴湖濱小住。　茜以為有這愛女的關係，可和史蒂夫重拾舊歡′因佯稱愛蓮有恙，促史蒂夫去。但是史蒂夫到的時候，愛蓮並沒有病，而菁茜剛在跳舞，史蒂夫遂憬然省悟，與瑪麗絲享家室之樂。</p>
<p>男女的結合，自然建築於愛情的基礎上的，史蒂夫與菁茜旣發生了裂痕，他們毅然的離婚是當然的，但是因為父女天性，使史蒂夫的精神仍受着苦痛的威脅，這是一個很難解决的問題。如「桃李爭春」那樣，菁茜和瑪麗絲結為摯友，那是太理想了。赫勃馬歇爾飾演這個徘徊在夫婦與骨肉之愛中間的史蒂夫，他是演得非常沉着的。</p>
<p>導演者羅拔辛克萊是舞台導演，「桃李爭春」還是他的試作，這里，他雖然沒有把「桃李爭春」舞台化，但是他不能把史蒂夫，菁茜和瑪麗絲三人間的情戚的演變更深入的描寫，所以，「桃李爭春」使我們威到的，祇是一個非常浮淺的故事，這是他的失敗，同時就使「桃李爭春」减削了深刻威人的力量。</p>

<p>— 迂堂</p>
<p>試看大抗戰序慕揭開以後，前後方都在利用電影話劇，作為抗戰的宣傳利器。除了極少的畸形區城之外，欣賞售劇的人已很不多了，不久抗戰勝利以後，在復興建設的時候，舊劇地位的跌落，更可預卜。你不要看見孤島大小型平劇塲天天客滿，便以為舊劇是生氣蓬勃着，還擁有大批觀衆。吿訴你這不過是一種畸形的發展一種病患者危篤時的迥光返照罷了。</p>
<p>許多熱心愛好舊劇之士，他們目擊舊劇由興而衰，不覺惄焉憂之，於是提出了改良舊劇的口號。所謂四大名旦，唱了半世舊戲，厭了，歸罪於舊戲詞句，鄙俚欠通；這樣，就有騷人墨客遺老遺少之類，替他們編製哀感頑艷的脚本，詞藻典麗的劇辭，以新戲為標榜，可是結果劇本的意識，並不怎樣前進，演出的技術，也並不比舊劇本進步；單說別姬的劍，葬花的鋤，就毫無藝術的價值，不如醉酒刺虎等身段遠甚，而出諸名家手筆的劇詞，寫在紙上，固然清麗可誦，在舞台上唱將出來，台下依然莫明其妙；反不如舊劇詞句，婦孺都可了解。假如這樣便算改良舊劇，無疑是失敗的，李石曾焦菊影輩，見富連成發了財，又嫌他辦得不好，就辦了一所戲曲學校。敎十來歲小孩子讀戲劇理論嫌早；敎唱戲還是少不了請敎老伶工，因此造就出來的人才，旣並不比富連成强，祗好趕快請已成名了的旦角敎峨嵋劍盤絲洞。這也算不了改良。王泊生起勁過一陣「新歌劇」，他愛好舊劇，也懂得一點西洋戲劇，於是想從舊劇中摘取一些肥料，去灌漑他所幻想的以一種新形式出現的新歌劇。他在山東辦了好些時戲劇學校，沒有什麼成績表現給我們看；不過我一想到這位先生從前在上海大唱其一百二十六句的上天台的情景，可以逆料他的所謂新歌劇，除了把舊劇的面目，撕得更支離破碎，賣一回野人頭之外，决不會有滿意的收穫的。利用英美人士對中國的好奇心理，熊式乙的穿中國古裝說外國話的王寳釧，着實出了一下風頭，（類似的劇本，我們貴國多着呢，）接着王寳釧看膩了，換個崔鶯鶯，等到外國人看厭了時，熊式乙的口袋也飽了。舊劇也給他挖苦得够r，不過他還沒有說道是在替舊劇改良。（二）</p>

<p>老譚以前，唱探母之健者，自以張二奎為最，楊月樓亦有名，得其緒餘除許蔭棠與宗奎孫二派之名票恩宇芝（與紅豆館主包丹庭等齊名）奎派外余三勝亦負盛譽，與譚派鼎足之汪桂芬孫菊仙亦演此劇，但已不敵老譚矣。汪之後王鳳鄉在民八以前歌喉未衰，此劇亦能動人。老譚謝世後若干年，余叔岩崛起，譚調之得永垂不衰者，叔岩不為無功，自檜以下，可不具論。茲述老譚時代珠聯璧合之角色如下：譚鑫培（四郞，）王瑤卿（公主，）陳德霖（蕭太后，）李順亭（六郎，）時小福（四夫人，）謝寳雲（佘太君，）朱素雲（宗保，（老譚怛化之後，舊都名伶之唱探母者，推王鳳卿與余叔岩兩人為擅長，其配角則為陳德霖（蕭太后，）冀雲甫（佘太君，）梅蘭芳（公主，）王琴儂（四夫人，）姜妙香（宗保，）張春彥（六郎）矣。蕭太后一角，舍德霖以外，李寳琴亦不惡，吳彩霞趙之香芙蓉草尚有可取。佘太君一角，舍謝寳雲龍雲甫外，可說繼起乏人，公主一角，梅蘭芳獨搜勝塲，硯秋小雲皆相形見絀，六郎一角，李順亭外，推賈洪林為勝，四夫人一角，吳彩霞趙芝香亦頗稱職，坤伶之中，孟小冬與雪豔琴，堪稱二難矣。</p>
<p>此外為可資談助者，馬連良到滬越唱越紅，而其生平以未能與梅蘭芳合唱探母為憾。某年滬上盛大堂會，速良由平來滬，志在一過探母戲　，結果蘭芳仍與譚富英合唱，連良亦無如之何也。譚富英在滬之聲譽，向居連良之下，乃在張嘯林堂會中，與連良同唱探母一劇，富英大為聽者激賞，從茲富英聲名大振，連良此後且不大敢動此劇矣。但最近富英在黄金唱「呌小番一不能使嘎調，又為觀客所不滿，平心而論，即不能使嘎調，亦不足為辱也。又滬上麒麟童亦唱過幾次探母，是否一人獨唱到底，或係與高百歲合唱，則不得而知，此劇在周信芳或另有作風，亦未可知也</p>

<p>關終新艷秋的被捕經過，本刊已兩次發表，頗為讀者所注意·有人問我新伶究竟是生是死？那我敢斷定她並沒有死，據北平路透社二十日電傳新伶「瘦死獄中，」此訊傳出，大家總覺得突兀，所以本刊復於二十三日詳載其被捕經過，說她受傷保釋之後，已入協和醫院療養，想來也不至於死，旣巳保出更不至疢死獄中，這是顯而易見的。至於新伶之被捕而遭受不人道的體刑，照我想完全出於冤枉，共中當然也有相當複雜的原因，諸位讀了下面這篇短文，也可以明瞭些。</p>

<p>迭見報載關於名伶新艷秋死難一事，俾說紛紜，莫衷一是，即本刊亦已有二種不同之記載矣。近據某寓平友人來函，亦曾述及此事，其所敘事實叉略有不同，茲姑誌之於後，真相如何，尚待事實之證明也。</p>
<p>據該函中云：「北平偽組織人物，現極盛行捧角，繆斌所捧者即為新艷秋；每逢新伶登臺，其戲票幾全部為繆所包銷。繆妻紫以兇悍著名，故常欲設法陷害之。某日，新艷秋在吉祥戲院登臺，繆斌於事前定一包廂，但臨時此包廂忽被一關某（或即係路透電中之關徵林——作者按）所佔法，繆逆竞因此而得不死。緣是日適有人謀刺斌，其所定包廂雖已易人，而「繆部長」之字條，仍未撕去。刺客一時不察，竟誤關為綫，砰然一聲，關某竟作替死鬼。而事後繆妻竟密吿於日人，謂此事係新艷秋暗中受共產黨之主使，有意做成國套，企圖殺繆。於是新伶遂被認入獄，截止發信時尚無其他發展云。</p>

<p>上月間，他應南京某戲院之聘，想到金陵去上演一番。變方說妥，包銀是按月七百元，於是他便整理行裝，打了通行證，在許多朋友們簪他餞行之後，便欣欣然乘了長途汽車動身了。那知車到半路，車因某種緣故，受了損壞，他的兩腿也跌傷了，在吃了這－務大驚駭之下，滿肚不高興的趕回上海了。到了上海，就根據這點理由提出向南京某戲院解約。</p>
<p>現在，他的兩腿創傷，已經痊愈，而且跟朋友一樣，快快活活的過着廢歷的新年。但是，如果有人詢問他這次遇險的經過，他就會有聲有色的把當時的情形摹倣給對方看。他說他如河籌備動身；他說他坐的是什麼汽車；他說他坐在汽車裹是如何有趣；他說汽車遇險前，看見了一些什麼；他說汽車遇險時的恐慌；他說汽車損壞的情形；他說他自己的腿跌傷——那裏；他說怎樣才决心回上海，他說到了上海之後是如何治療的；本本末末，不憚麻煩的，一情一筋的講給對方聽；結果，是「險呀險呀」的引出了結語，那就是，</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) After the military leaders of Guilin arrived in southern Guangdong to deploy defenses, the southern route has been strengthened with troops, and the situation has taken on a new look. General observation suggests that the Japanese army is temporarily unable to invade southern Guangdong, and the talk of attacking Guilin is even further from the truth. The military authorities of the northeast routes, due to the continuous Japanese reinforcements to the East River in recent weeks, have strengthened their forces to prevent the Japanese army from large-scale incursions and are preparing to encircle and attack the Japanese. The Chief of Staff of the Southwest Headquarters stated yesterday that the Japanese army landing on Hainan Island can only control the coastal areas. To date, those occupied are only Haikou, Qiongshan, Chengmai, Wenchang, Ding'an, and Yulin Port. The vast majority of the rest is still in the hands of the Chinese army, which is under the full command of Wang Yi, and communication with the rear is as usual. It will certainly be able to hold out against the Japanese army for a long time. (Special dispatch at 9 p.m. on the 27th)</p>
<p>Wuzhou: The Japanese army's invasion of Hainan Island has encountered strong resistance from the Chinese army and civilians, resulting in many casualties. Now they are redeploying troops from Taiwan for reinforcements. Also, the Japanese army on Zhou Island is forcing the islanders to purchase "obedient people's stamps." (Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a report from a Central News Agency correspondent in Hong Kong, the Japanese army that invaded Nantou, northwest of Hong Kong, a few days ago has completely withdrawn. The city's security is now maintained by the Chinese militia, and all commercial institutions have resumed operations. Japanese planes flew to reconnoiter in the morning and distributed absurd leaflets. (Express News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a Chinese report, the situation in the Leizhou Peninsula and the southern route of Guangdong Province is still very tense, because the Japanese warships gathered at the above two places have not left yet and frequently send many speedboats carrying soldiers to patrol in between, attempting to find an opportunity to land. (Express News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the battle on the East River has suddenly become tense. After continuous reinforcements, the Japanese army is advancing eastward from Shilong, Zhangmutou, and other places, attempting to seize Boluo and Huiyang. Currently, the battles are very fierce at Hengli and Shima, southwest of Boluo and Huiyang. Hengli and Shima are both on the east side of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, with highways directly to Huiyang and Boluo. (Express News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources outside Guangzhou Bay, a squadron of the Chinese Air Force bombed Haikou in northern Hainan Island on the morning of the 25th of this month. It is heard that one Japanese transport ship was hit and severely damaged. (Express News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: More than 300 Japanese infantrymen advanced from Shengang towards Dagangling on the morning of the 20th but were repelled by the Chinese Wu Regiment. At noon, more than 100 Japanese soldiers, covered by artillery, advanced again, fighting fiercely until night, but ultimately failed and retreated along the original route. Subsequently, more than 1,000 infantrymen, several heavy machine guns, 60 or 70 cavalrymen, and two cannons were added to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese. The Chinese army bravely confronted and launched a bayonet charge, slightly weakening the Japanese momentum. The Chinese army is still holding the original positions. (Telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>(Huaiyin) The Japanese army in Central China plans to open the Longhai Railway line and consolidate the occupied areas, appointing Major General Tagawa as the "Xudong Commander," leading the Horii and Rikuno Regiments, and inviting collaboration with bandit puppet troops, using Suqian as a base for eastward attacks, attacking Huaisi on one side and advancing along the Zhenghai Highway to spy on Shuyang to cover their left flank, invading eastward from the Longhai Railway to meet the Japanese army in Lianyungang. The Chinese authorities keenly observed the Japanese army's conspiracy and properly deployed troops on all routes. Bloody battles have now begun. After the Chinese army attacked Xin'an Town on the morning of the 23rd, morale was boosted. On the morning of the 25th, more than 300 Japanese soldiers from Shunheji, accompanied by two tanks and three cannons, advanced eastward along the Su-Shu Highway and encountered the Chinese army at Caojiaji, engaging in a bloody battle that lasted all day. In the evening, they were still engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Both the Japanese and Chinese suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, more than 500 Japanese soldiers from Buzi Ji also advanced on Yanghe and released tear gas. Dozens of Chinese army officers and soldiers were poisoned, leading to a partial breakthrough of the position. The Chinese army then launched a strong reserve counterattack, killing over 100 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army then collapsed and retreated, with several captured alive. According to their confessions, they belonged to the 31st Regiment of the Japanese 14th Division, which departed from Tianjin to Xu and then to Su on the 11th of last month. Their diaries were found to be full of war-weariness. In the evening, the Japanese army reinforced again, and the Chinese army bravely resisted, leading to a stalemate. (Telegram on the 27th)</p>

Furthermore, over 1,000 Japanese soldiers previously attacked Sanyangdian, at the foot of the Chinese Dahong Mountain, attempting to contain the Chinese army and respond to the Japanese army in Tianmen, seeking an opportunity to attack. After three days of fierce fighting, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army, in order to avoid being surrounded by the Japanese army due to numerical inferiority, withdrew to the area near Sanyangdian last night, awaiting an opportunity to counterattack. There have been no changes on the front line in Sui County, but the Japanese army north of the Zhe River has recently been spreading rumors around Yujiadian. (Telegram on the 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e18">After Britain and France Recognize the National Army Government of Spain <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>When Eden visited the United States last year, President Roosevelt hinted to him that Britain must not recognize the rebel government of Spain. President Roosevelt's reasoning was very clear: because the Spanish National Army under the command of the Italian and German fascists was merely a puppet, recognizing the National Army government was tantamount to legalizing fascist aggression. Democratic countries could not actively help the government army, but at least they should strictly adhere to the "non-recognition doctrine" towards the aggressors. However, Chamberlain and Daladier clearly refused to understand President Roosevelt's hint and finally, at a time when the Spanish resistance was entering a critical juncture, openly decided to recognize the Spanish National Army government as the legitimate government. Recognizing the National Army government is tantamount to not recognizing the existence of the legitimate government elected by the Spanish people. Today, when peace-loving people in Britain, France, and even the world are shouting "Aid the Spanish Republic," the actions of the British and French governments in encouraging aggression are truly the opposite of international justice and a betrayal of the majority of the people at home.</p>
<p>Moreover, the unjust behavior of Britain and France in recognizing the Spanish National Army government this time not only violates the principles of democracy, but is also incomprehensible from the perspective of their own interests. Everyone knows that the Mediterranean is Britain's lifeline, and Gibraltar is especially the gateway to the eastern Mediterranean. If Mussolini's puppet Franco controlled Spain, then they could cut off Gibraltar's communications from Spanish ports such as Cadiz, Ceuta, Melilla, Palma, and Cartagena; the Italian navy could further isolate Malta from its base in Pantelleria, and British shipping routes would be greatly threatened, and the Mediterranean would really be in danger of becoming an "Italian inland sea."</p>
<p>Due to geographical proximity, a fascist Spain poses an even greater threat to France. The communications from Toulon in mainland France to places such as Bizerte in North Africa represent the cornerstone of France's hegemony in the western Mediterranean. If the Spanish Mediterranean coast falls into the hands of fascist forces, then the triangle formed by Barcelona-Mahon-Cartagena in Spain will fundamentally destroy France's cornerstone in the western Mediterranean. Not only that, France and Spain are only separated by the Pyrenees Mountains. Since the fall of Barcelona, the border between France and the territory of the Spanish National Army is 600 li long, and France's southern face has been taken over by its Fascist enemy; it is now trapped on three sides.</p>
<p>Since the threat of a Fascist Spain to Britain and France is as described above, Britain and France, in order to protect their own interests, should abandon the "non-intervention" policy and actively assist the Spanish Republican government. That is the solution; but why are they insisting on recognizing the National Army government? To be honest, this is because they made a mistake from the beginning, and now the die is cast. It is too late to regret, so they can only make the best of a bad job and take this opportunity to step down.</p>
<p>However, they also have reasons to justify themselves. According to French Prime Minister Daladier's speech in the Chamber of Deputies on the 24th, the reasons for recognizing the National Army are approximately two points: (1) "Since the National Army government is the de facto government of Spain, France should establish good neighborly relations with it;" (2) "The interests that France maintains in Spain are extremely important, so it is necessary to send a formal representative to reside in the city of Burgos." The intentions of the British and French authorities are very clear. They want to please Franco before the Spanish government forces are completely defeated, in order to "offset the influence of Italy and Germany in Spain." Chamberlain has always been playing a "wishful thinking" game, believing that although Italian and German fascists can conquer Spain, they are unable to build Spain. Once the war is over, to build Spain, they must obey London's orders, at which time Britain can replace Mussolini to control Franco.</p>
<p>Chamberlain's plan may inevitably become an empty fantasy. Who does not know that Franco today can no longer have independent will. He is unable to withdraw foreign fascist troops, nor can he withdraw foreign troops. First, Mussolini is not a fool. Over the past two years, the sacrifices of the Blackshirt troops sent to the Iberian Peninsula by the tens of thousands, are they really for the purpose of "having no territorial ambition towards Spain"? The Italian volunteers still refuse to withdraw and will never withdraw. Second, the progress of Franco's army is mainly due to the strength of the Blackshirt army. Without the support of the Blackshirt army, Franco's puppet would not be able to stand. French Socialist Party member Isar once pointed out: "Previously, when National Army Commander Colonel Ruiz took a British ship to Menorca to discuss a peaceful handover with the government authorities, Italian pilots bombed the island, which shows that the Italian troops under the Spanish National Army obey Mussolini's orders and cannot be commanded by Franco." From this point, it can also be known that the Spain ruled by Franco is actually equivalent to the Spain in Mussolini's hands.</p>
<p>Now, the actions of Britain and France in recognizing the Spanish National Army government have aroused fierce opposition from the people in Britain and France. According to a Huitong telegram on the 26th, Spanish Prime Minister Negrin has also firmly declared that he will continue the resistance to the end. American journalist Fisher said it very incisively: "Spain cannot be conquered. Even if it is suppressed for a while, a civil war will still break out six months later. Franco can never bring peace."</p>
<p>The result of Britain and France recognizing the Spanish National Army government is nothing more than encouraging the greater ambitions of fascist aggressors and deepening the new international crisis. According to observations from political figures in Paris, there are signs that this new crisis may erupt in the middle of next month. Let's wait and see!</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Fan Keqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Public Concession's Municipal Council, sent a reply on Saturday evening to Japanese Consul-General Miura, responding to the Japanese side's "Basic Proposal to Eliminate Illegal Elements in the Public Concession." This reply was forwarded to Tokyo on Sunday, and this morning, the three ministries of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs held a joint conference to discuss issuing new instructions to the Japanese authorities in Shanghai regarding this reply. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue new instructions after the meeting. According to a telegram from Shanghai, Japanese diplomatic, army, and naval authorities in Shanghai held an emergency meeting on the flagship Izumo yesterday morning to discuss Fan Keqing's reply. The content of the reply has not been released, but according to newspaper reports, the Shanghai Municipal Council has shown no indication of changing its attitude. The Japanese authorities are determined not to alter their consistent peaceful approach towards the Municipal Council. However, if their peaceful approach is not reciprocated by the Municipal Council, the Japanese side's determination to eliminate illegal elements within the Public Concession by appropriate means will not change. The Asahi Shimbun reported that the Municipal Council's February 15 reply to the Japanese representative regarding the terrorist attacks was somewhat vague on certain points and did not intend to accept the specific details proposed by the Japanese side. However, today's meeting deemed it appropriate to "act leniently," at least temporarily acknowledging the Municipal Council's sincerity. Therefore, the Japanese representatives in Shanghai will likely meet with Chairman Fan Keqing today to present a second note, acknowledging Fan's reply as acceptance in principle. However, the Japanese representatives will continue to exert efforts in negotiations with the Municipal Council in Shanghai to achieve their specific demands. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Most newspapers this morning prominently featured news of the Japanese warning to the Shanghai Public Concession and the Japanese threat to British territory, with headlines such as "Japan Warns Shanghai Public Concession" and "Japan Threatens British Territory," regarding the Japanese side's potential actions to suppress terrorists within the Shanghai Public Concession. However, there were no commentaries on the Shanghai Municipal Council. The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph reported that London had not received any formal new information regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council last night. Judging from the situation on Saturday, it is hoped that the situation will not develop along a very difficult path. However, the situation in Tianjin is more concerning, and London is closely monitoring it. The correspondent further stated that the British government is reportedly satisfied with Japan's apology, acceptance of indemnity, and expressions regarding the bombing of Hong Kong territory. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the bombing of the New Territories across from Hong Kong by Japanese aircraft, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the British government considers the matter closed after the Japanese government presented a reply to the British government expressing deep regret, stating that the responsible personnel would be punished, and that the issue of compensation would be negotiated directly between the British and Japanese authorities. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) During a House of Commons meeting today, Conservative MP Sir Milner asked Under-Secretary Butler whether he had taken note of the demands made by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. Butler replied in the affirmative, stating that the Japanese side's proposals for more effective methods of maintaining law and order in Shanghai are currently under consideration by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The British government is closely monitoring the overall situation and will continue, as in the past, to provide the Municipal Council with possible advice and assistance. The issue of increasing defenses within the Public Concession is a matter for the Municipal Council to decide. (Reuter, 27th)</p>

<p>(London) According to the London "Daily Express," the Japanese government yesterday presented a completely unexpected peace overture to the Chinese government. It is claimed that the Japanese government proposed that the future Chinese government would give General Chiang Kai-shek a prominent position. If Chongqing agrees to accept, the Japanese troops stationed in central and southern China would be withdrawn. Troops would still be allowed to be stationed in North China. At the same time, Japan proposed that all foreign countries that have tried hard to mediate and reconcile cooperate to "develop" the economy of North China. As for the establishment of the Kuomintang government, it is said that Wang Jingwei, who was expelled from the party on January 2nd, was proposed as chairman. It is said that Major General Kita, military attaché of the Japanese army stationed in Beiping, is one of the strongest supporters of this plan. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)</p>

<p>(London) An important figure who has just returned from Burgos, Spain, said that once the civil war in the country ends and unification is achieved, General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army, will serve as regent of the Spanish Empire, in preparation for the restoration of the deposed Prince Juan, the heir to the throne. Although the British government has not expressed its opinion on the future political system of Spain, it is well known that the royal family wishes to see the Duke of Alba, Spain's informal representative in London, ascend to the throne. However, opinions around General Franco are also divided. For example, the Carlist faction advocates restoration, while the Fascist Spanish Phalanx advocates a strong dictatorship. They have been at odds with each other until now and have not been able to reach a consensus. Furthermore, Germany and Italy view the restoration as a clear declaration of Spain's willingness to maintain its independence, which is not in their interests and will certainly be obstructed. However, it can be asserted that the Catholic Church, especially the Jesuits, enjoys significant influence in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Nationalist government and can exert a decisive influence on the country's future political system.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government plans to mobilize all retailers across the country from July 1st of this year, requiring them to report the gross amount of goods sold in the past twelve months and their value, in order to conduct a nationwide goods survey. As the war against China cannot be concluded in a short time, the Japanese government plans to have a long-term construction plan to transform Japan's economic system. It is expected that the goods survey will have a far-reaching impact on this initiative. The government has collected all the necessary data on major goods, but regarding the consumption of daily necessities that are essential to the lives of the people, there is no way to conduct the survey due to numerous difficulties. After the recent passage of a law, it is now possible to carry out the goods survey. (Reuter, 27th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Hiroshi Saito, has been suffering from lung disease since he left office last fall and has been receiving medical treatment in the United States. He has not recovered, and his condition suddenly worsened today, leading to his death. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement upon hearing the news, expressing his condolences. He stated that since Ambassador Saito was sent to the United States in 1934, he worked diligently to establish good relations between Japan and the United States, exhausting his efforts and becoming ill from overwork, leading to his passing. Throughout his life, he was worthy of being called a loyal servant of the Japanese Emperor and the Japanese nation. Upon hearing the news, friends from all countries will surely mourn his death.

<h3 id="e39">Where is Poland Going? Students Again Hold Anti-German Demonstrations; Ciano Meets with Beck Again <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Warsaw: Colonel Tomaszewski, leader of the Polish "Student Army," initiated an anti-German demonstration at the University of Warsaw today. Prior to this, he obtained special permission from Prime Minister General Składkowski. Deputy Minister of the Army, General Grudzinski, along with several officers from the General Staff, also attended the event. Colonel Tomaszewski addressed the crowd, stating that the youth of the nation must prepare to sacrifice. "We have nothing to return to others; what we should demand from others is inexhaustible." The students then shouted, "Long live Polish Danzig! Long live Polish East Prussia!" Colonel Tomaszewski continued, "The Free City of Danzig is a boil on Poland's body that must be excised." (Meaning that Danzig should be reclaimed by Poland.) The students then shouted, "Foreign Minister Beck is a quack!" Colonel Tomaszewski concluded by saying that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is a friend of Poland, and the student community should avoid causing trouble during his visit. To prevent disturbances, the police authorities dispatched officers to force the students to leave the University of Warsaw. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Approximately 5,000 residents of Gdynia in northern Poland held an anti-German demonstration yesterday, shouting "Forward to Danzig!" and attempting to approach the German Consulate, but were dispersed by the police. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Sunday passed peacefully here due to the strict precautions taken by the authorities. There were no further anti-German demonstrations yesterday. The University of Warsaw and the German Embassy had guards stationed. As Italian Foreign Minister Ciano drove along the main street in a car, a small group of students shouted slogans such as "Long live Italy and France!" and "Down with Germany!" (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Following the repeated anti-German demonstrations by Polish university students, the local newspapers, under the direction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed regret. They stated, "It is regrettable that disputes arose between German and Polish students at the Danzig School of Arts and Crafts after the school groundlessly expelled several Polish students. It is understandable that students within Poland hold politically-oriented demonstrations to support the expelled students. However, it is inappropriate for troublemakers to involve themselves in Poland's foreign policy. The government has now taken effective measures to stop the demonstrations. It should be known that such demonstrations, no matter how justified the cause, are sufficient to put the government at a disadvantage. Newspapers and politicians hostile to Poland can use this as material for slander, thereby harming Poland's national interests. It is hoped that the youth of our country will appreciate this and demonstrate the virtues of respecting national discipline." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin): Following the anti-German demonstrations that have occurred in Poland for several consecutive days, political figures here have not yet expressed any views, but are deeply displeased. The German government has taken note of the Polish government's expression of apology. Due to the presence of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Warsaw, it is considered more appropriate to remain silent. At the same time, the German Embassy in Warsaw has been instructed to conduct an investigation and, if necessary, take appropriate measures to deal with the situation. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at noon today and held talks with Foreign Minister Beck for one hour. In the afternoon, he paid a visit to President Mościcki. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with Polish Foreign Minister Beck this afternoon. It is rumored that Ciano pressed the Polish side to clearly express its attitude toward Italy's demands on France. Foreign Minister Beck apparently wanted Mussolini to explain his attitude towards Germany's expansion of commercial and political power in southeastern Europe. Poland is disappointed that the previous arbitration between Germany and Italy did not award Ruthenia to Hungary to serve as a border between Poland and Hungary. Various circles in Poland believe that the current border is a potential source of conflict and a center for Ukrainian anti-Polish propaganda. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Several Italian journalists were drinking in a tavern and ordered the band to play Italian songs, which they joined in singing. Although the musicians complied, after playing the Italian songs, they immediately followed with the famous British song "It's a Long Way to Tipperary." The Polish customers also joined in. The Italian journalists, feeling deflated, left their seats and departed. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris): The right-wing Figaro recently published a dispatch from a visiting reporter stating, "According to the Italian delegation, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is currently visiting Poland, and Italy believes that Poland's current foreign policy is somewhat contradictory. This is because the country has a military alliance treaty with France and Romania, while also signing non-aggression pacts with Germany and the Soviet Union." However, Polish political figures believe that this policy is not contradictory and there is no intention to change it. In other words, although the country wishes to establish extremely friendly relations with Italy, it will continue to honor its alliance with France and Poland. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>(London): The Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency has decided to reject the British plan for solving the Palestine problem. Dr. Weizmann will announce this intention when the British formally present this proposal today. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London): Jewish people are expressing dissatisfaction with the British draft solution to the Palestine problem, considering it a betrayal of the Jewish people and a violation of the Balfour Declaration. They see it as a move that changes British policy and opens the way for an independent Arab state. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Jewish people in Jerusalem are holding meetings today to protest the British proposed solution for Palestine. They say that the Jewish people will never submit to any attempt at force or accept a minority status, even with any guarantees. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London): Regarding the Palestine problem, the Jewish community is strongly opposed to the solution proposed by the British government. Therefore, representatives of the Jewish community refused to attend a banquet hosted by the British government at noon today to show their protest. A key figure in the Zionist movement issued a statement saying, "The Jewish people around the world will be shocked and anxious to learn that the British government intends to establish an independent Arab state in Palestine. In this situation, it would be inappropriate to rashly attend the British government's banquet." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Tel Aviv: The Jewish Municipal Council of this city has passed a resolution expressing opposition to the British government's proposed solution to the Palestine problem, stating briefly that the revitalization efforts of the Jewish nation cannot be allowed to be extinguished. They also sent a telegram to British Colonial Secretary MacDonald, stating that this solution is contrary to the obligations accepted by the British government and the rights enjoyed by the Jewish people, and is unjust. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Regarding the Palestine problem, the Jewish Agency here has issued a declaration strongly opposing the British government's proposed solution, stating briefly, "This plan is tantamount to fundamentally overturning the Jewish plan to build a country in Palestine. The Jewish people in Palestine and around the world will undoubtedly fiercely resist it. This Agency hereby solemnly declares that any solution that attempts to restrict the free development of the Jewish people in Palestine and forces them to accept a minority status is unacceptable to the Jewish people." In addition, Jewish groups, such as the right-wing Zionist group led by Jabotinsky, the labor group led by Katznelson, and the moderates led by Weizmann, chairman of the Jewish Agency, have differing opinions. Due to the seriousness of the situation, they have decided to set aside their differences and establish a united front in order to concentrate their forces to oppose the solution proposed by the British. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London): According to sources from the Palestine Conference, when the British government proposes convening a round table conference this autumn, the Arab representatives will reiterate their demand for the establishment of an independent Arab state in Palestine, or they will propose that the current representatives in London organize a round table conference to discuss everything, with particular emphasis on protecting the interests of the British and the British community in Palestine. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Regarding the Palestine problem, after the British government proposed a solution to establish an independent Arab nation, the Arab residents of various cities and villages in Palestine were overjoyed, with slogans such as "We demand true independence!" and cheers such as "Long live Chamberlain!" and "Long live the Grand Mufti of Palestine!" Fireworks were set off on various hilltops to celebrate. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Regarding the Palestine problem, since the British government proposed a solution, the Arabs here welcome it because their community can enjoy privileges in Palestine, making it easy to move towards complete independence. Residents of the Arab communities in major cities such as Haifa, Jaffa, and Tulkarem have held rallies and parades through the main streets, singing various songs with great enthusiasm. However, terrorist activities in various places have not subsided, but have intensified. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Several terrorist incidents occurred in the cities of Palestine this morning, with many deaths and injuries among the Jewish and Arab populations. The authorities have taken preventive measures. The situation in the port of Tel Aviv is particularly serious, with six bombs exploding, killing 26 people and injuring 47. Two bombs also exploded on the railway tracks, but there were no casualties. In addition, one Arab was shot and killed. A public bus carrying Arabs was also ambushed by gunfire, but there were no casualties. Several bombs were found in the market of the port city of Haifa, killing 29 Arabs and injuring 38, including two Jewish policemen. The bombs at the train station and courthouse did not cause any injuries. In Jaffa, nine bombs only injured two people. In Jerusalem, two bombs killed four Arabs and injured seven. A train traveling from Tel Aviv to Lydda derailed, injuring five people. (Havas, 27th)</p>

Since then, only one hundred of the 120,000 Italian residents in Marseille have returned to Italy, and only about four or five hundred others are preparing to return. Most of these are usually subsidized by Italian residents' associations. Very few Italian residents in Paris have returned home. As far as the situation across the country is concerned, the vast majority of Italian residents want to stay in France and many want to naturalize as French citizens, but they have not been able to realize their wishes due to the many procedural difficulties. Since the situation is like this, when will our country finally implement a large-scale assimilation policy?" (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: In recent months, the Japanese army has expanded its invasion of southern China, using tens of thousands of troops to launch a large-scale offensive against Hainan Island. With the assistance of the navy and air force, they managed to land in Haikou City in Qiongshan County and Sanya Port in Yaxian County. However, after landing, they only occupied a few points along the coast. As soon as they advanced inland, they were repeatedly ambushed by the Chinese army, suffering great losses. So far, they are still blocked north of Longtang and Anren in Ding'an County. In the south, the east and west routes of Sanya Port have not yet been connected. Their foothold is difficult to maintain without the protection of naval ships. The Japanese military authorities seem to have a sense of being trapped in a quagmire at this time. However, having mounted the tiger, they have no choice but to increase their troops to support the difficult situation of their so-called southern expeditionary force. As a result, troops have been secretly withdrawn from the Xijiang (West River) area in Guangdong Province. For the past two weeks, the fighting in the Xijiang area has suddenly become quiet, for this reason.</p>
<p>Repeated Attacks Unsuccessful: Recently, while the Japanese army was engaged in operations on Hainan Island, the Chinese army called on guerrillas in various places to coordinate with the regular army and prepare to surround the Japanese troops in various war zones. In the Xijiang area, the guerrillas under the command of Lu are now scattered in the areas of Mabao, Mian, and Sanshui. They recently inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese army near Fanhe Township. The guerrillas near Jiujiang, belonging to the Li Fulin's troops, have twice raided the Japanese camp in Jiujiang at night, and have repeatedly ambushed Japanese stragglers between Jiujiang and Longjiang, achieving victories. The first guerrilla war zone in Guangdong Province includes the counties of Nanhai and Panyu. The south of Panyu was originally the guerrilla base of Li Fulin's troops and has long been a pain in the side for the Japanese army in Humen. Later, the Japanese army detected that the main force of Li's troops was in Datang in Panyu, so they launched a fierce attack on Datang with more than a thousand cavalry and infantry, and six Japanese aircraft took turns bombing. The Datang guerrillas safely withdrew from the southern part of Panyu because the fortifications were destroyed. However, a part of them are still stationed in the towns of Sanshan and Shibi in the southern part of Panyu, restraining Japanese troop transport. The Japanese army sent more than a hundred men, taking the Zhujiang River, to harass the towns of Sanshan and Dazhou by rubber boat. The guerrillas of the town engaged the approaching Japanese army head-on, killing dozens of them on the spot. The Japanese aircraft then arrived to provide support, and the guerrillas in the town avoided their fierce power and retreated while fighting. After the Japanese army invaded Dazhou Township, they pursued and spied on Shibi Township. The guerrillas held out against them for more than twenty hours, gaining considerable compensation, and then safely retreated. The Japanese army gained nothing except looting food and raping women in the towns they broke into. Later, they changed their route and attacked Sanshan by boat. The town faces the river and backs onto the mountains, a natural fortress, and hundreds of Japanese troops were unable to attack it. However, Pingzhou Township near Sanshan Township has been looted by the Japanese army several times.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Northern Panyu: The guerrilla team in northern Panyu (i.e., the northern part of Panyu, bordering Conghua and Huaxian), has always been commanded by Wu Guanhong. Wu is a military strategist and once served as the leader of the Self-Defense Force, with rich experience in the organization of local militias. When the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, they drove their troops to invade northern Panyu and Conghua in order to consolidate the outer defense line of Guangzhou. The guerrilla team in northern Panyu rose up in various places such as Wuhewei and Dagangwei. When the Japanese army invaded Guotang (a station on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway), Wu's troops moved to Guotang and attacked them, annihilating hundreds of Japanese troops. The Japanese army knew the location of Wu's troops, and the next day sent aircraft to bomb the villages around Guotang, killing more than a hundred innocent civilians. Seven or eight out of ten of the villagers' houses were destroyed, and five or six hundred refugees were displaced. The Dongjiang people have always been known for their bravery. The Japanese army was frightened by the several battles in Luofu Mountain, so they hurriedly withdrew from Huibo to Zengcheng, Dongguan, and Taiping, shortening their defense line. However, the Dongjiang guerrillas still ventured deep into the interior.</p>

<p>Wujin Correspondence: Since the central government intentionally adjusted the guerrilla forces in the eastern war zone, the various units have shifted from scattered individual operations to planned and unified operations. Now, all units have been ordered to actively surround important strongholds, so fierce battles have occurred along the Nanjing-Shanghai line in the past ten days, especially in Wujin, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Jiangyin counties. On the 20th, the Wuxi mobile unit took advantage of the Japanese army's departure to the northern countryside and attacked the county seat, encountering a fierce battle with the Japanese and puppet troops near Dongting. After suffering losses, the mobile unit retreated to the vicinity of Xuelang Mountain at dawn on the 21st.</p>
<p>In Wujin, a large unit of puppet troops in Qijia-Pan near Panshu was completely disarmed by the Chinese army. On the evening of the 18th, the mobile team entered the city and confiscated all 28 guns and 4,300 rounds of ammunition from the police station in the city. When the Japanese army saw the Chinese army entering the city, they were panicked and at a loss. Now, the Chinese army has been ordered to concentrate in a certain place, waiting for the general attack.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Mobile Brigade and the Nanjing-Shanghai Action Team in the Dongzhu, Jinshu, Tong'anqiao, Xihua, and Tandong areas are now actively pursuing the city of Suzhou. The Jiangnan 6th County Guerrilla Commander Xiong, specially sent by the Mobile Brigade Headquarters stationed in Changshu, has also crossed Yangcheng Lake and is advancing towards Suzhou. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, the team sent personnel to distribute the "Regulations for Traitors to Surrender" to the residences of various puppet officials in the city of Suzhou, hoping that the traitors would quickly realize their mistakes and participate in the resistance war. The Japanese side is terrified, entrenched in cement fortifications, as if facing a great enemy. On the night of the 16th, the mobile team attacked Mudu Town, killing the pseudo-Sui army battalion commander Ji Zongxian on the spot, and his troops were also disarmed. The Japanese instructor Gai Ben barely escaped with his life. Furthermore, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the pseudo-Sui 3rd District stationed in the Wujiang and Zhenze areas were also completely disarmed by the Chinese army. When the Chinese army went to disarm them, the officers and soldiers of the team understood the righteousness and did not return a single shot, because they deeply hated being betrayed by Cheng Wanjun alone. The Action Team of the Mobile Brigade, which operates in Jiangyin, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, has recently dispatched a large number of specially trained personnel from the Brigade Headquarters to establish "Jiangsu Youth Actively Loyal to the Government Movement Study Tour Expansion and Promotion" in various counties in the interior, and the youth participating are very enthusiastic. In order to improve work efficiency, the team established the Shanghai Suburban Action Team and appointed Miao Sen as its leader. The Hangzhou Team Leader Shen Beihai and the Nanjing Team Leader Xiao Gang have also arrived at their posts one after another. The team's special affairs负责人强雷则因向总队部有所请示、故巳离沪、</p>

<p>Haimen Correspondence: Haimen, Zhejiang Province, is one of the leading towns in Linhai, not only the center of politics, culture, economy, and commerce in Taizhou, but also a hub of transportation in eastern Zhejiang. The residents of the coastal area make a living by fishing, while the residents of the mountainous area mostly cultivate the mountains, so the main products are aquatic products, rice, and tea. Indigo and Taizhou oranges are also very abundant. The folk customs are fierce and combative, and most of the weapons are made by themselves, so violent fights often occur due to trivial reasons, which the government cannot prohibit. The folk organizations and factions are complex. The most famous are the "Big Ghosts" and "Little Ghosts" gangs. The organization of each gang is very planned and the strength is quite sound. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the local people was extremely high. The Seventh Administrative Inspectorate of Zhejiang Province is located in Haimen and is responsible for defense. Taihu Guerrilla Commander Xing Zhennan, who is currently the Inspector, has armed the entire Haimen. All the strong men, national soldiers, and police teams are organized into four major battalions. The District Chief兼Public Security Bureau Director暨兼Battalion Commander, Township Head兼Company Commander. Local patriotic people have long organized the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Committee, the Political Work Team, and the Political Propaganda Team. The streets and alleys are filled with anti-war documents, slogans, and wall newspapers. Wartime mobile education is conducted to educate the people as much as possible. The wartime mass mobilization inspection and guidance team inspects the streets from time to time, and at the same time, recruits strong men according to conscription. Fathers and sons, brothers, and many compete to enlist in the army, considering it an honor. The large and small bandit groups in the mountains, which were originally as numerous as hairs, have now surrendered one after another, petitioning the authorities to be incorporated. Several times last year, it was discovered that traitors attempted to cause trouble in the rear, so for the past six months, the Wen-Tai Defense Headquarters organized a martial law inspection station, limiting the number of ships and strictly inspecting passengers landing on shore, requiring identification cards with the person's fingerprints and guarantees from more than three shops. Recently, it has been rumored that traitors from Shanghai have sneaked into the Wen-Tai area to instigate bandits to surrender, but it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve any results. Haimen has long been watched by the Japanese army. On August 25 last year, Japanese aircraft bombed repeatedly, destroying almost the entire county chamber of commerce near the center of Haimen City, and many people were killed and injured. In recent times, Japanese warships have continued to attack various small islands off the coast, attempting to land, but the Chinese defenders are waiting in full battle array, and it is feared that the Japanese army will not easily succeed.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Duty-Free Foreign Rice Shipped to Shantou to Relieve Famine: Panic Over People's Food in Chaozhou and Meizhou Now a Thing of the Past <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the beginning of winter, grain prices in various parts of Chaozhou and Meizhou have skyrocketed. Consequently, each county has banned the export of grain, preventing mutual assistance. For instance, Yunxiao, Zhao'an, and Zhangpu counties in southern Fujian usually ship surplus rice to Chaozhou and Shantou every year. Recently, local garrisons, fearing that unscrupulous merchants would aid the enemy, have prohibited the export of grain. The same is true for Raoping and Jieyang counties in Chaozhou. Villagers carrying white rice on their shoulders to sell or exchange for other goods in neighboring counties are also intercepted by the district and township offices' police, accused of smuggling it out of the area. Initially, the boundary was between provinces; later, it became between counties, also called smuggling. Dabu County cannot purchase rice from Raoping. After the price of rice became expensive, even districts and townships within the same county demarcated boundaries. Rice from Raoping city heading to Huanggang and Fushan districts can be intercepted mid-way; even if only three or five families are involved, they are not spared. Those enforcing the orders disregard the facts and merely create self-imposed restrictions, causing villages that do not produce rice to be unable to purchase it. The price of rice is four or five yuan per catty. Last autumn, Chaozhou and Meizhou had bumper harvests, yet they are experiencing a rice shortage, which is truly strange. Various organizations have sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance, requesting immediate relief measures, advocating for the temporary duty-free import of foreign rice. The Hong Kong China Rice Company imported a large quantity of foreign rice last year (all imported duty-free). Among them, the stock stored in Guangzhou suffered losses of hundreds of thousands of bags due to the sudden arrival of the Japanese army. The stock stored in Hong Kong warehouses will be addressed after a shareholders' meeting. The Shantou Provincial Bank has specifically borrowed funds on behalf of the State Rice Operation Company to transport rice to Chaozhou and Shantou for famine relief. The first batch of 45,000 bags arrived on the 11th, transported by Desheng Shipping, duty-free. The second and third batches will continue to arrive. As a result, the current price of rice is 11 yuan and 75 cents per dan in national currency, and it is expected to continue to decline. The reason is that rice-producing villages are not short of rice. Rice from Fujian and Jiangxi can still be carried to Meixian. The upper reaches of the Han River do not urgently need foreign rice for relief.</p>

<p>Ya'an Correspondence: On the 14th, the reporter left Chengdu by car for Xikang, heading southwest from the station into the suburbs.</p>
<p>On the Chengdu-Ya'an Road: Outside Jinjiang City, fields crisscross. The morning sun shines through the thin mist, directly illuminating the dense trees, a lush scene with a hint of emerald green, making the scenery even more beautiful. Along the roadside, a row of red walls surrounds ancient towering cypress trees, which is the Wuhou Shrine. The reporter had visited it the day before, featuring statues of Wuhou and Emperor Zhaolie, magnificent halls, and numerous steles. Although troops are stationed there, visitors are not prevented. In the last hall with the statue of Wuhou, there is a stele engraved with Du Fu's poem, "Where can the Prime Minister's shrine be found? Cypress trees stand dense outside Jin Guan City," reading to the line "Dying before his task was accomplished," one cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy. Behind the hall is a high tomb, the burial place of Emperor Zhaolie. The spirit of Liu Xiang, the former chairman of Sichuan, is enshrined in the west courtyard, and tourists are prohibited from entering. The car arrived in Shuangliu County, stopping to refuel. It was heard that a certain senior central official was reviewing troops here. Continuing forward, crossing two small rivers, at eleven o'clock, it arrived at the old county, stopping for lunch. Passing through Xinjin County to Yang'an Town, stones and pebbles piled up, making the car ride quite bumpy. Crossing another small river, it arrived in Qionglai County, a bustling and lively market town. Legend has it that Sima Xiangru of the Han Dynasty met Zhuo Wenjun here and seduced her with music. The car carried the "Biography of Sima Xiangru" from the "Records of the Grand Historian." The county has the Qin Platform of Changqing and the Well of Wenjun, but due to the hurried journey, there was no time to admire the romantic relics. Continuing forward, villages connected swiftly, and the population became denser. However, along the way, most of the men and women carrying loads were wearing tattered clothes, barely covering their bodies. The hardship of the people in western Sichuan can be imagined. The car passed through Wolongchang, Datangchang, Heizhuyuan, Baizhangyi, and other stations. The mountains stretched out, from far to near, already close to the Qionglai Mountains. Although the hills were continuous, the road on top was as flat as a whetstone, and the car traveled like flying. It arrived in Mingshan County, a very small city, mostly damaged and dilapidated, in urgent need of repair. The county is surrounded by mountains, making its terrain dangerous, thus becoming an important military stronghold. Passing Mingshan, large mountains stood on both sides, winding continuously. At times, evening mist gradually rose, and the evening breeze brought cold, creating a desolate wilderness, giving a sense of borderland atmosphere. The car arrived at Jinji Bridge, only twenty-odd miles from Ya'an. The bridge is the boundary between Mingshan and Ya'an counties, also the border between Sichuan and Xikang provinces. Passing Jinji Mountain, the car climbed over the hilltop for more than ten minutes. Legend has it that a golden rooster crowed here, and the mountain shape resembles a golden rooster spreading its wings. Descending the slope, it arrived at Jinjiguan, the first important pass between Mingshan and Ya'an, a strategic location for military strategists. From here, one can see the Mengding of northern Ya'an from afar. Around four o'clock in the afternoon, it arrived in Ya'an, lodging at the Xinsheng Travel Agency. The 360-li journey between Chengdu and Ya'an came to an end.</p>
<p>Recent View of Ya'an: Ya'an in the Three Dynasties was originally the Qingyi State, belonging to Liang Province in the Tribute of Yu, a place inhabited by various southwestern Yi peoples, with the Qiang people being the most prominent. During the Qin Dynasty, the Chu Yan clan was relocated here to strengthen it, establishing Yan'dao County, belonging to Shu County. Before the Ming Dynasty, whether there were city walls is unknown. It was not until the early Hongwu period that the great general Hu Dahai was ordered to supervise the construction of stone city walls. Even today, the character "Hu" can still be vaguely seen engraved on the city stones. The city is based on the upper reaches of the Qingyi River, also known as the Mo River, or the Pingqiang River, named after Zhuge Liang pacifying the Qiang rebellion here, commonly known as the Ya River. The county is bordered by the Min River to the east, the Dadu River to the west, the Qionglai Mountains to the north, and Mount Emei to the south. High peaks and deep valleys, with natural and steep terrain, control the vital passage between Sichuan and Tibet, a major town in eastern Kangding. Its Mengshan in the north produces the most famous tea. Legend has it that during the Ming Dynasty, a monk named Lizhen came from the Western Regions, bringing tea seeds to plant here. During the Qing Dynasty, it was harvested as tribute, named Xiantai, the so-called Mengding tea. To the southeast of the city is Cai Mountain. Legend has it that Zhuge Liang dreamed of the Duke of Zhou on this mountain during his southern expedition, and a temple was built for him, which still exists today, hence it is also known as Zhougong Mountain, one of the Eight Scenic Spots of Ya'an. When Ya'an was under the jurisdiction of Sichuan, it was originally a second-class county. After being劃劃劃劃划劃划划划劃 divided into Xikang, it will be promoted to a first-class county, administratively divided into four districts, with a population of about 130,000. Due to the lack of popular education, illiteracy accounts for more than half of the population. There are more than 80 elementary schools in the county. Within the city, there is the Ningyaqiong Joint Middle School, with more than 300 male and female students, a total of twelve classes in both senior and junior high. The monthly expenditure is more than 2,900 yuan, which has been issued by Kang Province since September last year. There are 29 faculty members, and the principal, Chen Yaoshu, a Sichuanese, is young, knowledgeable, and diligent in management, resulting in remarkable achievements and outstanding reputation. Tea is the most important product, and all five grains are available, with maize production being the highest, but food is not sufficient, and it is still necessary to rely on external counties. The annual tea production is more than two million catties, sold to Kang and Tibet, worth no less than three million yuan. Social economy relies on resource adjustment. There are Sichuan and Shaanxi tea merchants, and the sales still follow the guide system. In recent years, Indian tea has encroached, greatly affecting the border tea. In addition, a large number of Kang and Tibetan medicinal herbs are collected here and sold to Sichuan and Hubei, but since the outbreak of the war, it is not as prosperous as before. There are seven banks, including Sichuan, Xikang, and Chongqing, and their business is mostly related to tea and medicine. Zhenggong Street is the most prosperous commercial area, and roads have been built. Once the Sichuan-Kangding Highway is completed, the commerce of Ya'an will become even more prosperous. The Ya'an-Luding section of the highway has been built past Erlang Mountain, and there are currently more than 30,000 workers working there. The Ya'an County Government has recently recruited more than 8,000 workers, scheduled to start building the section between Erlang Mountain and Luding after the fifteenth day of the lunar new year. County Magistrate Xu Jian specifically went to the countryside to explain to the people the significance of recruiting workers to build roads and develop transportation. According to Wang Yongfu, deputy director of the Sichuan-Kangding Highway Engineering Office, the Ya'an-Kangding section can be completed within this year, and the steel, American-style suspension bridge over the Dadu River in Luding is being actively constructed, with a deadline for completion, so that traffic can be opened by the end of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Japanese Threat to the Hong Kong Border: Intrusion into Bao'an for Six Hours <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Lunar New Year in Hong Kong is even more lively than in Shanghai. The thoughts and actions of the Hong Kong Chinese are extremely stubborn, believing in gods and clinging to old customs, something never seen in other major cities in the country. At the same time, because Hong Kong is a British territory, the Sino-Japanese War cannot affect it. The number of wealthy refugees fleeing from various places is countless. Therefore, the Lunar New Year scene this year is even more enthusiastic than in previous years. The sound of firecrackers is endless day and night, and the singing and dancing halls, restaurants, and theaters are full, and the amount of waste is difficult to estimate. However, at this time, the Nantou and Shenzhen areas on the Hong Kong border are filled with the sound of artillery fire, and flesh and blood are everywhere. Only a few dozen miles away, heaven and hell are clearly separated. It is difficult to understand this. The Japanese army's threat to Hong Kong has never been so severe. At the time when the Japanese army fiercely attacked Hainan Island, this action was taken, which we must pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Bao'an Nantou Occupied in Succession: Bao'an is a county town on the east bank of the Pearl River Estuary, and Nantou is a coastal town in Bao'an County, both bordering the British leased territory of Hong Kong and Kowloon. When the Japanese army occupied Shenzhen last winter, Bao'an was once in danger, but soon the Japanese army occupying Shenzhen retreated, and Bao'an was unharmed. Currently, in Bao'an city and its surrounding areas, because there is the sea in front and no way to retreat behind, the Chinese army has long since withdrawn, with only a few police maintaining law and order. The area is not a strategic pass and has no military value. Unexpectedly, on New Year's Eve (the 17th), the Japanese army stationed in Taiping bypassed the Taibao Highway and advanced south, attacking Bao'an County on one side and Nantou fiercely on the other. At that time, the residents of both Bao'an and Nantou were still in their dreams, when they suddenly heard the sound of gunfire, getting closer and closer, so they fled in panic. The police in both places stepped forward to resist, but because of the disparity in numbers, many were killed and injured. By about six o'clock in the morning, Bao'an and Nantou had fallen one after another. Chinese police and local officials retreated to the Shatoujiao construction works to defend against the Japanese army attacking Shenzhen again. The Japanese army attacking Bao'an and Nantou numbered about 300, although they did not carry heavy weapons, they were fully equipped with machine guns and small artillery. After occupying Nantou, they appointed the traitor Zhang as the chairman of the maintenance committee, and the Japanese army then carried out large-scale searches, rapes, and massacres, doing everything. Another part of the Japanese army occupied Bao'an County, and after the occupation, the Taiping puppet maintenance committee chairman He, who came with the Japanese army, came forward to maintain order, on the one hand, not allowing residents to flee, and on the other hand, forcing the Dasanyuan Restaurant on Daxin Street in the city to be responsible for supplying the Japanese army with food and drink. Unexpectedly, just when the large and small traitors were in high spirits, the Japanese army suddenly received orders to withdraw, so the traitors also fled back to Taiping with the Japanese army. Bao'an County was occupied by the Japanese army for only six hours before and after, while the Japanese army in Nantou did not retreat until the morning of the next day (18th).</p>
<p>The Japanese Are Now Threatening Britain: Bao'an and Nantou are neither military strongholds nor have Chinese troops stationed there, and they are close to the British border, so the Japanese army has no need to attack. Since Shenzhen was once occupied by the Japanese army, after British negotiations, they withdrew, and the Chinese side also has no troops stationed there. Therefore, this sudden occupation of Bao'an Nantou and the bombing of Shenzhen by the Japanese army, and even more disregard for everything, intruding into British airspace and dropping bombs on British section stations and vehicles on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, appears to be a planned conspiracy. According to general observation, the only purpose of the Japanese army is to test Britain's true attitude and threaten Britain, so that it will not take a positive attitude towards the situation in South China. Since the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, the attitudes of Britain and France have indeed been likely to become tougher, so they intentionally threatened the British again to find out the truth. Now the British side has protested against the new threats from the Japanese army and aircraft, and the development of the situation in South China will be even more watched.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Chinese Army Commando Raids the Southern Section of Jinpu Railway: Two Japanese Military Trains Bombed <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Huaiyin Correspondence: A certain battalion of the Chinese army commando, previously ordered to go to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway to engage in guerrilla warfare, has repeatedly destroyed the railway and raided Tianchang, repeatedly making outstanding achievements. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Destroying the Railway: A certain company of the battalion takes attacking Japanese military trains as its main task. On a certain day at the beginning of the month, Zhao, the battalion commander of the battalion, led his troops to advance towards the Mingguang area. Around 2:00 a.m., they arrived near Lishantou between Zhangsha and immediately destroyed the bridge, set up landmines, and buried explosives in sections. By about 7:00 a.m. the next morning, a Japanese military train arrived, triggering the landmines. Several feet of rails were completely destroyed, and a locomotive overturned on the roadside. The Japanese army disembarked in panic and bombarded everywhere with heavy artillery. The Chinese ambush replied with sparse gunshots and retreated immediately, while the Japanese army bombarded fiercely for several hours, consuming a lot of ammunition and leaving. On the evening of the 17th at 3:00 a.m., the battalion again contacted the armed civilians of Xuyi and buried landmines at both ends of the bridge near Wangcun Yingshantou, north of Guandian, and deployed a large number of ambushes around the railway, waiting for the opportunity to attack. By about 6:00 a.m. at dawn, a Japanese train arrived, with nineteen carriages, with armored vehicles at both ends, full of Japanese soldiers and small boats. Just as it arrived at the bridge, it detonated the landmines, and the locomotive and most of the train completely overturned on the roadside. Taking advantage of the chaos of the Japanese soldiers, the Chinese army suddenly attacked with hand grenades and machine guns, and the Japanese soldiers were caught off guard, killing more than 300 people, while the Chinese army suffered no losses.</p>
<p>In-Depth Tianchang: On the 22nd of the month, Chao, the battalion commander, considering that the Japanese army in Tianchang city was weak, specially selected 24 people from his troops to form a suicide squad, all in plain clothes, secretly carrying short guns, hand grenades and other weapons, at 11:00 a.m. taking advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness, occupied the west gate of the city and the west street in the city, and attacked the Japanese command headquarters. At the same time, the Chinese artillery stationed in Hejiadu also responded with artillery fire. After receiving the news, the Japanese army gathered in the park to resist stubbornly. The Chinese army, with the mission accomplished, safely returned to defense at 6:00 p.m. that day. In this battle, the Chinese army only used 24 people, staying in the city for seven hours, and wiped out more than a dozen guards, and seized three 38-type rifles and one light machine gun, which is truly a miracle.</p>

<p>Hai'ning Correspondence: Zhu Xi's Jiangnan Guerrilla Advance Team, joined with Jiang Shuwei's unit, attacked Wangdian Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line on the 22nd from three directions. The Japanese railway patrol team at Wangdian immediately rose to fight, and eight of them were killed. Several foreign bridges, such as No. 9 on the Hangzhou-Shanghai Highway, three miles west of Hai'ning City, were destroyed by the Chinese army, and the power lines were cut off. On the 23rd, they took advantage of the situation to recover Baishi Bridge southeast of Haining. Fierce fighting occurred between the two sides. The Chinese army rushed into Haining Town, and the daughter of the puppet magistrate Tan Yuqing, who was sleeping with Ren, the head of the Japanese appeasement squad, fled in panic that night. Later, the Chinese army temporarily retreated to the suburbs as a large number of Japanese reinforcements arrived. On the same day, 40 Japanese soldiers from Fengshumiao and Xieqiao were bravely defeated by Wu, the Chinese army's commander. Fengshumiao was then recovered by the Chinese army.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Shanghai Education Circle: Opinions on Reforming Education - Continuing Education for In-Service Middle School Teachers After the Establishment of Normal Colleges (Part 4) <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Shijin</p>
<p>The Difficulties and Solutions to Continuing Education for Middle School Teachers</p>
<p>Although continuing education for middle school teachers is important, if the difficulties in teachers' continuing education are not addressed, teachers may not be willing to pursue it even if they have the opportunity. The Zhejiang Education Department and Zhejiang University once jointly organized summer training workshops for educational service personnel. Despite great effort, only sixty-seven middle school teachers attended. Furthermore, the Shanghai Education Bureau once held training workshops for science teachers in secondary schools. Because of the low participation rate, the bureau issued a general order forcing schools to participate and threatened to terminate contracts. Therefore, if in-service teachers are to pursue continuing education, their difficulties must be understood, solutions must be found, effective measures must be established, and their motivation must be encouraged. The major difficulties teachers face in continuing education can be summarized as follows: (A) Economic Issues: Teachers' salaries are meager, and even daily expenses are difficult to cover. Educational expenses for children are hard to come by, so there are no surplus funds for their own continuing education. To address the economic issue, schools should provide appropriate financial assistance based on the length of service. After continuing education, their rank and salary should be increased. Continuing education institutions should waive tuition and board fees and increase the amount of scholarship money. (B) Family Issues: Some teachers lack the courage to temporarily leave their wives and children and are unwilling to leave their hometown, hindering their progress. The affections for children and the weakness of heroes are indeed a real difficulty, compounded by economic considerations, making it no wonder they cannot proceed. The key to resolving this problem lies mostly within the family. Those with foresight should strongly encourage the realization of continuing education plans and should not hinder them. Those who pursue continuing education can advance, while those who regress will inevitably be eliminated. Family members, with their deep concern, should carefully consider and kindly explain the situation, so it should not become a problem. (C) Psychological Issues: The self-sufficiency and complacency of teachers are the greatest enemies of continuing education. Teachers often feel that they can handle their current work, can follow the routine, and live out their lives in peace, so why bother with continuing education and go through all that trouble? To overcome this difficulty, the government must publish regulations on teacher continuing education, urge schools to implement them, and stipulate regulations for the employment of secondary school teachers, emphasizing qualifications for professional training. Schools should formulate measures for teacher continuing education and provide economic convenience and spiritual encouragement to teachers who are determined to pursue it. In addition, society should also create a strong atmosphere for teacher continuing education, making teachers feel that they are not qualified to be teachers without continuing education. (D) Continuing Education Institutions: Where can teachers go for continuing education? Can institutions responsible for teacher training provide teachers with convenient opportunities for continuing education? This was indeed a problem in the past. Now that normal colleges have been established in various regions across the country, this problem is relatively easier to solve. In addition to directly providing continuing education to high school and junior high school teachers through continuing education classes, normal colleges can also use other indirect methods that are also very effective. According to Article 4 of the Normal College Regulations, "Normal colleges should assist the educational administrative agencies in their designated regions in researching and assisting the secondary education within the region." Within the scope of this article, there are many things that normal colleges and educational administrative agencies can do to promote continuing education for middle school teachers, such as convening various meetings for teachers under their jurisdiction, organizing training workshops, and holding summer research conferences. This approach has been popular in England for some time, but it is still in its early stages in China. For example, formulate plans for supervisory inspections to improve the teaching effectiveness of teachers, publish educational publications to enhance teachers' knowledge, open correspondence courses or teacher correspondence, so that teachers can have avenues for inquiry, and establish circulating reading groups and demonstration education, so that teachers have something to borrow and something to follow. Compile educational tools and guide practical training programs, so that teachers with research interests can get convenience and guidance in their work. The above are just a few examples, and if they can be implemented in order, they will greatly help teachers' continuing education.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, no modern country is unaware of the importance of normal education. Especially after a country has undergone massive destruction, education is the necessary path to reconstruction, and normal education is the most fundamental task of the entire new education. The youth of the future are the masters of national rejuvenation, and normal colleges, which cultivate these masters, must shoulder their most important mission. Currently, the qualifications of most in-service middle school teachers do not meet the requirements, and they have many weaknesses. If they do not pursue continuing education, they cannot continue to bear the important task of training young people. Now, at the time of the establishment of normal colleges across the country, we should take the opportunity to make plans for continuing education. Normal colleges should plan effective measures to make it convenient for in-service middle school teachers to pursue continuing education. In addition, educational administrative agencies and school authorities should also do their best to encourage the implementation of continuing education plans and solve the problems teachers face in their continuing education. With good continuing education for teachers, young people will have good mentors, and the country will have the foundation for revival. If teachers lack sound training, how can they cultivate useful youth for the country? Advanced countries in Europe and America all attach great importance to normal education and pay attention to teacher continuing education, which can be said to be knowing how to engage in fundamental work.

<p>The charity football tournament organized by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Refugee Relief Association, in order to attract spectators and raise more funds, specifically decided to invite the "King of Football" Li Huitang to come to Shanghai to participate. Because it concerned a charitable cause, Mr. Li graciously agreed. It was originally scheduled for him to come to Shanghai for the competition during the lunar New Year. However, due to the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Games in Hong Kong, Mr. Li requested a postponement until around March 12 to come to Shanghai. The Relief Committee and the Association specifically arranged two charity matches, one this Sunday and one next Sunday, so that Mr. Li could come to Shanghai to participate. All Shanghai football fans were eagerly anticipating his arrival and asking about Mr. Li's travel schedule. However, the day before yesterday, a letter from Mr. Li from Hong Kong was suddenly received, stating that he had decided to decline the Shanghai invitation and cancel his trip to Shanghai. The reason was that public opinion in Hong Kong was strongly opposed, and they jointly sent a letter to Mr. Li, stating that it was "ill-advised to enter a dangerous country." Although Mr. Li himself was willing to do what was right, he ultimately canceled his trip to Shanghai due to the opposition from public opinion. Millions of football fans in Shanghai will be extremely disappointed upon hearing this news.</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Japanese Side is Dissatisfied with the Municipal Council's Reply - Will Submit a New Note Again - Originally Scheduled to be Sent Yesterday, But Suddenly Postponed - Japanese Soldiers Deploy Outside the Boundary, Threatening the Bureau <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's reply to the Japanese protest was sent out at 6 PM last Saturday. It was personally handed over to Japanese Consul General Miura by Chairman Fackling. The wording and content were very firm. There was originally a plan to publish the full text yesterday, but the Municipal Council is still unwilling to announce it. However, the general idea is that the various measures taken by the police authorities are effective in maintaining public order, and they are now actively stepping up necessary preventive work to curb the "source of chaos." It also stated that the concession authorities have always made every effort to maintain public order and have never slackened or abandoned their duties. The strength of the police force is also a fact that can be verified and is not something that the Japanese side can interfere with. After receiving this reply, the Japanese side expressed great dissatisfaction and convened another meeting of naval, land, and diplomatic officials on the Izumo flagship to discuss countermeasures and consult with Tokyo. Subsequently, Japanese Consul General Miura received instructions from Tokyo to submit a new note to the Municipal Council. It was originally scheduled to visit Municipal Council Chairman Fackling at 3 PM yesterday (27) to personally hand over the note. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Fackling, accompanied by McNoughton, Felippe, and President Feixindun, who had been on leave for a long time, as well as several Japanese directors, waited in the council chamber at around 3 PM. However, at 3:15 PM, they suddenly received a phone call from the Japanese consul general, postponing the submission of the note. Fackling and others then left. The reason for the Japanese postponement of the protest is said to be that the wording of the new note still needs to be revised. Therefore, this note may be submitted today (28). It is reported that the Japanese attitude is not to escalate the situation, but they hope that the concession authorities can be responsible for ensuring and effectively eradicating all terrorist elements.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Sends Troops to Station Outside</p>
<p>The Japanese military headquarters has sent a number of Japanese soldiers to deploy in the Japanese-occupied area in the western suburbs of the city, which is under the jurisdiction of the "Great Dao Municipal Government." The number of people has not been announced. The Japanese side believes that increasing defenses in the western suburbs is a means of threatening the Municipal Council, so that the Municipal Council has no choice but to accept the Japanese demands. It is reported that the Japanese soldiers stationed in the western suburbs are under orders not to conflict with the British forces in the area.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side is Not Satisfied with the Reply</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that Japanese Consul General Miura is scheduled to meet with Municipal Council Chairman Fackling this afternoon (27th) to further discuss the Japanese translation of the note sent to Fackling on the 22nd of this month and Fackling's reply at the end of the week. Although the wording of Fackling's reply has not been announced, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily News" jokingly called the content of the reply "arrogant and cunning." The Japanese authorities are "dissatisfied" and believe that "the reply is tantamount to rejecting the key points of the Japanese demands." The Japanese authorities have decided to take a resolute attitude to deal with the Municipal Council in order to thoroughly resolve the "outstanding issue" and not give an inch. Now there are only two paths: either immediately resort to force, or take "very tough measures" after taking formal routine procedures.</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Japanese Side Arbitrarily Arrests Passengers on German Ships - The German Consul Submits a Written Protest - Demanding Immediate Release - Foreign Merchants Are Outraged and Ask for Stern Action <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The "Feikang" ship of the German company Lu Lin Yanghang in this city was suddenly intercepted by a Japanese warship at 7 AM on the 24th of this month in the waters of Dinghai Island outside the mouth of Wusong while sailing from Shanghai to Wen. Japanese soldiers were ordered to board the ship to conduct inspections, and four Chinese passengers were arrested. Since the incident occurred, Lu Mang Yanghang has believed that this action by the Japanese side clearly harms foreign business operations. Therefore, it reported the information to the German Consulate General in Shanghai, requesting serious negotiations and demanding the immediate release of the arrested passengers. The German Consul made an oral representation to the Japanese side, but the Japanese side claimed that the four people were suspected of being guerrillas and needed to be investigated, so they refused to release them. According to news from Lu Lin Yanghang yesterday, the German Consul has formally submitted a written protest to the Japanese Consul, demanding the speedy release of the arrested passengers and preventing similar incidents from happening in the future. However, as of yesterday afternoon, no response had been received from the Japanese side. According to inquiries from reporters to foreign merchants, various countries' shipping companies believe that the Japanese side's various illegal actions are clearly intended to deliberately exclude foreign shipping and infringe on legitimate business operations. Therefore, their attitude is quite indignant, and it is reported that they will unanimously unite and demand that their respective governments take stern action.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Attack Wantonly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese army, navy, and civil administration authorities have protested to the police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession regarding the terrorist acts that have occurred in the concessions. The Japanese newspapers have criticized the concession authorities for lacking "sincerity." The Japanese residents north of the Suzhou River have suggested that the Japanese army should handle all matters themselves and appoint a Japanese police chief to hold the highest police power. At the same time, senior officials from the police departments of the two concessions and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have been closely studying how to effectively curb the activities of terrorist gangs. According to a certain foreigner who has lived in this city for a long time, the Shanghai Times said yesterday that the foreign authorities in Shanghai are quite indignant about the "lack of sincerity" and the fact that the concession is able to curb terrorist acts only with great effort. It is obviously beneficial to them to keep Shanghai quiet and maintain relations with the Japanese side on the basis of working as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>Cishuda Building Was Also Sealed Off Yesterday</p>
<p>In recent days, in order to prevent terrorist incidents from occurring within the boundary, the police authorities of the Public Concession have specially sealed off the alleys connecting Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Fuzhou Road, and Guangdong Road for prevention. The F陀 Street at the bottom of Cishuda Building on Nanjing Road connects to Jiujiang Road and was formerly known as Hotel Street. Yesterday, the exit to Nanjing Road was also sealed off.</p>
<p>The Original Text of the Japanese Consul's Letter Was Published</p>
<p>On February 15, the letter from the Japanese Consul General and Commander of the Marine Corps in Shanghai to the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding the security issues during the Lunar New Year was published by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo on February 22. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from Consul General Miura to Chairman Franklin of the Shanghai Municipal Council on February 15: Regarding the recent terrorist incidents in the Public Concession, this official raised this issue for your attention during the meeting with you on February 10. However, on February 19, information was received that unstable elements were attempting to carry out terrorist acts. In order to prevent the recurrence of such terrorist acts, the concession authorities should take special measures. This official recalls the appropriate measures taken by the concession authorities for the Memorial Day on August 13 last year and firmly believes that this time it can also prevent problems before they occur. In addition, the memorandum of the Commander of the Special Marine Corps of the Japanese Navy is attached to convey the commander's wishes, as attached.</p>
<p>Memorandum of the Commander of the Special Marine Corps of the Japanese Navy</p>
<p>It goes without saying that all agencies responsible for maintaining public order in Shanghai should do their best to enable residents to live and work in peace. The Commander of the Special Marine Corps of the Japanese Navy deeply regrets that since the end of January, terrorist acts have occurred repeatedly in the Public Concession south of the Suzhou River, and the concession authorities have failed to arrest a single terrorist. Although the terror zone is outside the Japanese defense zone, the Japanese Navy, in its defense mission, cannot be indifferent to the unrest in the aforementioned area within the Public Concession. The Japanese side has now received information that unstable elements are planning to carry out terrorist acts on the evening of February 19. Therefore, they are even more concerned about maintaining peace and order. Recalling that the concession authorities took serious measures to pass the August 13 Memorial Day safely last year, it is even more regrettable that the current state of unrest could not be eliminated. In order to prevent terrorist acts before and after the Lunar New Year, the Commander of the Special Marine Corps of the Japanese Navy believes that it is necessary to work closely with all parties concerned in order to improve the current situation in Shanghai and restore the usual state of peace.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Japanese Company Mitsui &amp; Co. Buys Up Grain in Various Places - The First Batch of More Than 50,000 Bags Will Be Exported to Japan Soon - Shanghai's Rice Supply Is Sufficient, and Market Prices Have Slightly Dropped <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side has relied on special violence to search for rice in the rice-producing counties along the Yangtze River in the occupied areas and smuggle it back to the country. The number is quite large. Recently, the grain department of the Japanese company Mitsui &amp; Co. sent personnel to the inland areas to buy rice and load it to Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and other places for transportation. The reporter of the Modern Society has learned the details as follows:</p>
<p>Mitsui Packages for Export</p>
<p>The grain department of the Japanese company Mitsui &amp; Co. in this city sent five Chinese employees to various rice-producing areas in the inland areas to buy rice at the beginning of last week. According to information learned by the reporter of the Modern Society from the rice industry, when the autumn harvest was on the market last year, the Japanese side searched for a large amount of rice and smuggled it to Dadong. In about two months, it was estimated at more than 2 million dan. In February of this year, the Japanese side realized that the direct purchase and transshipment of rice by the North and South Ocean gangs was very profitable. Therefore, the Japanese company Mitsui &amp; Co. took the opportunity to rise up and seize the rights and interests of purchasing, transporting, and transshipping rice, transferring huge amounts of capital to purchase rice in the inland areas and loading it on Japanese ships for sale to Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and other ports. Not only is the entire transportation controlled, but the rice price can also be arbitrarily raised in the sales market. The first batch of more than 50,000 bags can be exported to Japan in a few days.</p>
<p>The Japanese Puppets Even Stipulate Grain Transportation Methods</p>
<p>As for the rice transported from the inland areas to Shanghai, the Japanese puppet "organs" have stipulated several "methods," which are summarized as follows: (1) Before merchants and shops go to the rice-producing areas to purchase, they must obtain a "removal certificate." (2) When the rice is barged to the wharf for loading on ships, the shipping company or transfer company in the place of residence must "guarantee" and prove that the rice is indeed transported to Shanghai for sale; otherwise, loading will be refused. At the same time, the Japanese puppets also oppress merchants and residents and will levy a "landing tax" of 5 jiao per stone of rice from March 1. The rice merchants in each place are doing their best to oppose the illegal increase in taxes.</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice Prices Slightly Dropped Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the report of the rice market in this city, since the market opened on February 24, the daily rice price standard has been the same as when the market closed during the Lunar New Year. It was not until yesterday that it slightly dropped. The highest grade of white japonica rice was 12 yuan and 67 jiao, and the middle and lower grades were between 10 yuan and 45 jiao and 11 yuan and 78 jiao, which was about 2 or 3 jiao lower per dan than after the market opened. In terms of the current rice stock in Shanghai, although the inland supply has decreased, the rice price is not expected to rise sharply.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," thirty-one foreign nationals and five Chinese "amahs" who evacuated from Kuling arrived in Shanghai on a Japanese warship at nearly noon today. They disembarked at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha wharf. Their luggage was covered in mud, indicating a difficult journey. They left Kuling at 9:00 AM three days ago, accompanied by one British and one American naval officer each.</p>
<p>Heavy rain poured down. They waded through water. At 1:00 PM, they reached the foot of the mountain, and at 3:30 PM, they entered Kiukiang. Soon after, the American river gunboat "Wake" sailed from Kiukiang to Hankow, carrying the American consul and British vice-consul. The British gunboat "Gnat" and a British Yangtze River steamer remain in Kiukiang. Four Germans and four British also stayed in the city. According to a certain foreign national who arrived in Shanghai, fifty adults and four children remain in Kuling. It is unknown</p>
<p>how they will spend their days as the war progresses in that area. The American Children's School and a hotel south of Kuling have been designated as safe zones. After drinking tea at the Japanese Consulate, we boarded the Japanese warship. However, it did not set sail until 10:00 AM on Thursday. It anchored every evening. According to an officer on the ship, this was due to fear of guerrilla attacks and possible river mines. But we did not encounter any accidents, it was said. It is heard that of the eight foreign nationals who remained in Kiukiang, several plan to leave Kiukiang for British concessions.</p>

<p>The Japanese navy has recently been harassing the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang. For example, a few days ago, a Japanese warship bombarded Haimen (Taizhou). Yesterday, a rumor spread in this city that a Japanese warship had bombarded Zhenhai yesterday morning, firing over thirty shells before fleeing. On the Zhenhai side, because the Japanese warship fired indiscriminately, there were no losses. Shanghai-Ningbo ships are sailing as usual. Today, Weirich's "Sinan," Taikoo's "New Peking," set sail for Ningbo on time.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Power Company decided to raise prices by another 10% starting March 1st, the 35th District Branch of the First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the general association, requesting them to negotiate for cancellation. It is now learned that the City Association has forwarded a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, requesting them to forward it to the Public Works Department to consider the current difficult times and cancel the increase. Furthermore, the Shanghai Special District Housing Problem Committee, the Rental Dispute Mediation Committee, and other public organizations also believe that during these difficult times, the power company should not repeatedly raise prices. Two price increases within half a year are not only unbearable for users but also provide landlords with an excuse to raise rents for subtenants, repeatedly creating disputes. It is deeply hoped that the authorities of various companies can share the hardship and not implement the increase.</p>

<p>According to the "Continental Times," in recent weeks, many members of the Japanese Diet from various parties have expressed increasing concern about the current state of Japanese finance. The ominous term "inflation" has been mentioned frequently. The statements of the Diet members are, of course, very cautious, but it is beyond doubt that many of them view the overall situation in Japan as serious, even precarious. The "Tokyo Hochi Shimbun" published a speech given by a member of the Minseito Party in the Diet on February 13. A section of it is quoted below, which can be used to gain insight. The Diet member said, "I believe that the danger of inflation, which everyone is unwilling to see, still lurks today. Therefore, the government must carefully guard against this latent danger and compile a budget that truly coordinates with the overall development. I know that 2.7 billion yen in national bonds still need to be issued this fiscal year. I know that this may be because the government still has surplus funds, and partly because of the lack of goods and raw materials, so it has not been issued immediately. Although the public's absorption of government bonds is said to be smooth, I am only cautiously optimistic about this matter, because I am aware of the huge amount of government bonds held by the Bank of Japan. At present, the Japanese nation has the responsibility to pay interest on government bonds of 5.22 yen per citizen every year. The government should not only deal with the overall situation with temporary stopgap measures."</p>

<p>In view of the fact that merchants in various regions have successively launched charitable sales and donation campaigns to serve the country, their enthusiasm is highly commendable. For the purpose of encouragement, when levying income tax and excess profits tax on these charitable sales and donations, the Ministry of Finance has specially stipulated the following three auditing methods: (1) If the amount of charitable sales and donations of each business is included in the total annual sales, and the cost of the charitable sales goods is also included in the total annual sales cost, the amount of the charitable sales and donations may be deducted in full. (2) If the amount of charitable sales and donations of each business is not included in the total annual sales, and the cost of the charitable sales goods is also not included in the total annual sales cost, the cost of the charitable sales goods may be deducted in full. (3) If the amount of charitable sales and donations of each business is included in the total annual sales, and the cost of the charitable sales goods has been included in the cost of annual sales, because the amount of charitable sales and donations has been deducted and is not regarded as income, and the cost of the charitable sales goods has been included in the cost of sales as donations, no further deductions will be allowed. The Shanghai Income Tax Office and other offices have all been ordered to follow these procedures.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Economic Affairs temporarily approved the transport and sale of local products such as bamboo, wood, paper, eggs, charcoal, and cotton from Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to the Shanghai Concession, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has implemented certification. Various industries have been rushing to purchase local products from the interior and transport them to Shanghai for adjustment. Local products blocked in Wenzhou, Ningbo, and other places have been inspected and released by the customs. Shipping companies operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Ningbo, and Shanghai-Fujian routes have added ships.

<p>The house at No. 23, Lane 749, Yuyuan Road, was originally the residence of former Shanghai Special Mayor Zhang Dingfan. After the war, all of Zhang's family members lived far away in Guilin, leaving only a servant to guard the house. On the morning of the day before yesterday, several Japanese armed military police suddenly arrived by car and broke into the house, conducting a thorough search. Then, they expelled the servant guarding the house, locked the house, and posted a seal, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. This matter is almost the same as the sealing of the residence of former Minister of Communications Wang Boqun. Gambling dens are everywhere in that area. The Japanese have coveted this house for a long time, intending to turn it into a clubhouse.</p>

<p>The amount of white coal transported to Japan from the Kailuan Coal Mine in North China this year has exceeded 1,700,000 tons. This year, the Kailuan Coal Mine in North China produced 5,300,000 tons of coal. It is heard that the coal mine's output next year will increase to 6,500,000 tons.

<p>According to someone from Jiading yesterday, the Chinese army of Deng Jinglie's troops stationed in various districts of Jiading County, about 2,000 people, set out at 6:00 AM on the 25th of this month, led by Deng himself with about 500 troops, in four directions: east, south, west, and north, to jointly attack the county seat. After hearing the news, the Japanese army closed all the city gates and set up machine guns on the city walls to sweep downwards. At that time, the Chinese army disintegrated into small groups and hid in villages near the city without retaliating. At about 11:00 AM, the Japanese army believed that the Chinese army had retreated and opened the south and north gates to conduct a demonstration outside the city. The Chinese army then launched a surprise attack, killing or wounding more than ten Japanese soldiers. The order inside and outside the city was in chaos. Residents were killed or injured by stray bullets or trampling, with four or five casualties. The rest fled into the city and closed the city again, completely severing traffic. Until the next morning, in retaliation, the Japanese army set up small steel cannons on the four gates of the city and indiscriminately bombarded various villages in the suburbs, destroying many houses.</p>

<p>The late Nantong industrialist Zhang Tui'an (察) devoted his life to industry, establishing various industrial companies and yarn factories. The most prominent of these were the Dasheng Textile Company, Dada Shipping Company, and various salt reclamation companies, as well as the Jifu Xing Flour Mill, Guangsheng Oil Mill, and Zisheng Weaving Factory. He was involved in all of them. Therefore, Nantong has the reputation of being a model county, and Tangjiazha was established as a factory area. He devoted his full efforts, together with his younger brother Se'an, to planning local public welfare undertakings, establishing schools, organizing institutions for the deaf, dumb, disabled, and elderly, building roads, and opening parks, from dikes to culverts, benefiting the local area. The whole population praised him. Later, in his old age, he retired to Buddhism. During the barbarian invasion of last March, he lamented the continuous disasters and the destruction of his life's work in one fell swoop. He sought refuge at sea, unable to express his grief, and passed away from illness on the 26th of last month, at the age of eighty-eight. (His passing was previously reported in this newspaper.) He left instructions not to hold a wake or send out obituaries. His son, Jingli, followed his father's instructions and decided not to waste money. However, in memory of his father's great achievements during his lifetime, and the fact that he lived to a ripe old age and was reborn in the Pure Land, now, at the time of the fifth ritual, he consulted with his mother and decided to hold a memorial service at the Fazang Temple on Jialele Road tomorrow (March 1st). It is expected that various circles will come to express their condolences on Jialele Road, and the white horses and plain carriages will be extremely mournful.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Farmers Bank Implements - Negotiating Low-Interest Loans for Pawnshops - Fixed Amount from 30,000 to 50,000 Yuan - Extending Redemption Period and Reducing Interest <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The pawnshop industry in our country is established widely throughout the country. From major trading ports to remote rural towns, there are pawnshops, which are the only places for ordinary people to get emergency money. It is a pity that most of those who open pawnshops</p>
<p>charge higher interest rates due to the relationship between emergency financing. The redemption period is also short. Although various provinces and cities have orders to crack down on pawnshop interest rates, there is a lack of fundamental methods to supply funds at low interest rates, and the actual effect is minimal. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi specially ordered the Farmers Bank of China to negotiate low-interest loans of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan for pawnshops, and ordered pawnshops to reduce interest rates,</p>
<p>extend the redemption period. This is truly a good policy that benefits the common people. The full text of the ministry's telegram is recorded below for the information of the provincial governments: After investigating the pawnshop industry in our country, it was found that it originated with ordinary people and is promoted throughout the country. It is an excellent institution for regulating social finance. Ordinary people use goods for money. Credit is extremely reliable and procedures are very simple. It is necessary to maintain and develop it. However, in the past, due to</p>
<p>limited funds and capital, interest rates were too high and the time limit was too short. This has resulted in the burden being too heavy for the pledgers, or they are unable to redeem the goods on time, so that the excellent institution has not been able to fully exert its effectiveness. It should be maintained and developed to benefit the common people. From the date of this circular, all pawnshop interest rates throughout the country should be reduced immediately. Taking into account the local financial situation,</p>
<p>fair interest rates should be stipulated. The redemption period should also be appropriately extended and uniformly reported to the local government for approval and implementation. Those who violate the regulations will be cracked down upon. If the pawnshop industry does not have sufficient funds for operation, it will also be allowed to negotiate low-interest loans of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan from the local Farmers Bank of China, so that the pawnshop industry can</p>
<p>operate smoothly and the general public can benefit. In addition to separate telegrams and telegram orders to the Farmers Bank of China and its branches, I specially request that you investigate and order all Xingdang business associations to notify all pawnshops to operate uniformly, and to report back to the Ministry for verification. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi Yu Qianyin,</p>

<p>According to shipping industry news, the "Sinan" of the American Weirich Company, the "De Zheng" of the Italian Sino-Italian Company, and the "Tang Sai" of the American China Merchants Steam Navigation Company set sail from Ningbo successively on the morning before yesterday. When they sailed to the waters of Xiaoji Mountain at around 4:00 PM, three Japanese warships anchored there used signal flags to stop them from sailing. Then, they used signal flags to question the ships, asking about their nationality, where they came from, where they were going, etc. After the foreign captains of each ship replied with signal flags, they were released, but no personnel were sent to board the ships for inspection.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Announces to Overseas Chinese - Do Not Bring Goods Privately to Vietnam - Customs Inspection of Overseas Chinese Entering the Country is Very Strict - Saigon Consulate's Negotiations Are Very Troublesome <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Training Order Wilderness Ding Yu No. 196 states: According to a report from the Saigon Consulate, it is found that if Chinese people bring goods when coming to Vietnam, they must report to the customs upon entry and pay taxes according to law. However, some water carriers and ignorant tourists often hide and conceal their goods in order to evade taxes. Once discovered by the customs, fines follow. As a result, the customs authorities are particularly strict with the entry of overseas Chinese. The Consulate has repeatedly negotiated, to no avail, and the fact that goods are privately carried with the intention of evading taxes is obvious. Negotiations are actually difficult to initiate, which affects the travel of legitimate overseas Chinese, which is not trivial. After investigating this matter, the Consulate issued a notice to overseas Chinese in June of the twenty-sixth year, clarifying that tourists should declare privately carried goods to the shipowner for handling, and advised travelers to abide by it. However, recently, it has been reported that there have been incidents of private goods being concealed and fined, and the general water carriers have intensified their efforts and persisted in their evil ways, so that legitimate travelers are very inconvenient when entering the country. In addition to the Consulate's strict investigation of smuggling water carriers and printing and distributing notices to advise overseas Chinese not to be deceived, it is also negotiated with the Guangzhou-Hong Kong and Guangzhou-Shantou money steamer companies to distribute them on their behalf. At the same time, a letter is sent to the commissioner's office in Hong Kong for the verification of cargo manifests, and it is proposed that the Council transfer orders to its subordinate overseas Chinese affairs bureaus to pay close attention during the handling of overseas Chinese exports, earnestly persuade them, and publicize them as necessary, etc. Inquiring into the case, the travel of overseas Chinese abroad is indeed necessary to pay attention to. In addition to separate orders, it is necessary to order the office to pay close attention, earnestly persuade, and publicize it widely.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Doing Good Is the Greatest Joy - Representatives Gathered in Ningbo to Discuss - Defense Department Finalized Measures for Special Fish Transport Vessels - Submitted to the × Group Army for Approval and Implementation <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Since Dinghai banned Shanghai ships from berthing, the sale of fish has been sluggish, which has greatly affected the livelihoods of fishermen. In order to relieve the fishing industry, the County Chamber of Commerce and the Fishermen's Association telegraphed the Ningbo Defense Headquarters and forwarded it to the Headquarters of the × Group Army, requesting the release of special fish transport vessels to transport and sell fish to Shanghai. Later, because the headquarters did not understand the local situation, it was not approved, so fish could not be transported to Shanghai. According to a report from a "Modern News" reporter stationed in Ningbo, Guo, the commander of the Ningbo Defense Headquarters, and Zhang, the deputy commander, listened to the appeals of fishermen and merchants and were concerned about the livelihoods of fishermen. They specially telegraphed and summoned representatives of fishermen and merchants to the headquarters to discuss fish transport measures. The relevant parties who were summoned arrived in Ningbo on the 24th, including Lin Zhihan, secretary of the Dinghai County government, Pan Ruoyu of the Anti-Enemy Association, Huang Junrong of the Fishery Association, Jun Mao-kuang of the Shenjiamen Chamber of Commerce, and Yan Yunrang, inspector of the Fisheries Management Office of the Construction Department. Five people went to the headquarters in the afternoon to meet Commander Guo and Deputy Commander Zhang to state their difficulties and the urgency of hiring boats to transport fish, and suggested several measures for fish transport. After reviewing by Commander Guo, the proposed measures are as follows: The special fish transport vessels should be mainly hired, limited to two ships, only allowed to load fish products for export, and absolutely not allowed to carry passengers or other goods. The remaining measures are omitted. Registration, inspection procedures, cargo import and export inspection, and cargo loading and passenger transport items must be handled in accordance with navigation regulations. The Defense Headquarters has telegraphed the proposed measures to the General Headquarters for instructions and will transfer the instructions to the office after approval.</p>

<p>Although the Ministry of Finance declared that it would no longer overdraw on various bonds guaranteed by customs duties due to the seizure of customs revenue in the occupied areas, in order to maintain bond credit, the government still advanced funds for the unified bonds that expired at the end of last month. The rejuvenation bonds due today will also be paid as usual. The Railway Construction Bond Fund will be subsidized by the Ministry. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Principal and Interest of Rejuvenation Bonds Paid as Usual</p>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee received an order from the Ministry of Finance that the sixth lottery of debt bonds for the 15th Year of the Republic of China Rejuvenation Bonds should be repaid with 1.7 million yuan in principal and 9,945,000 yuan in interest due. It was approved that the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau would pay in soft currency on November 28. It is planned to adopt the Chongqing soft currency payment method. Other places such as Shanghai will issue remittance vouchers to be paid off in six installments, the same as the sixth unified bond method. After receiving the order, the association immediately announced it to the public.</p>
<p>Tongyi Jin Chang Lottery Redemption</p>
<p>After the National Debt Fund Management Committee decided to hold the lottery redemption of domestic government bonds as usual, it was approved that the seventh redemption of the unified bond B type debt bonds would be nine, and the eleventh redemption of the long-term financial bonds would be twenty-five. The lottery will be held at 10:00 AM on March 10th. Representatives from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Silver Money Exchange, and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau will be sent to the meeting for supervision. In addition, the seventh redemption and interest payment for the five types of unified A, B, C, D, and E bonds, totaling 56,700,850 yuan, is scheduled for payment on July 30.</p>
<p>Railway Bond Fund Subsidized by Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Yesterday, a "New Voice News Agency" reporter learned from the financial sector that the third redemption of the first issuance of railway construction bonds, totaling 2 million yuan in principal and interest, and the second redemption of the second issuance of debt bonds, totaling 2 million yuan in principal and interest, have already been executed by the National Debt Fund Management Committee through lottery. In accordance with the regulations, payments will be approved starting from February 28. Before there is any surplus profit in the construction of new roads, the Ministry will allocate a subsidy fund to be specially reserved for payment by the bond custody committee. This government bond has not yet entered the market.</p>
<p>Jin Chang Payment Method Has Been Determined</p>
<p>In order to reorganize the suspended banknotes of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau in Hankou, the Ministry of Finance issued long-term financial bonds of the Republic of China for the 17th year, totaling 45 million yuan, with weekly interest of 2%, to be repaid in full by the end of September of the 42nd year, designating the surplus tax revenue as the fund. Since the Ministry of Finance declared that it would no longer overdraw, bondholders have paid close attention to whether the principal and interest of the government bonds will be paid as usual. The Financial Debt Fund Management Committee has scheduled a lottery and set the payment date for March 31. The principal and interest to be repaid is 1,546,875 yuan. According to financial news yesterday, the Ministry of Finance's payment method will be announced soon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau stopped developing Guangdong province after its currency exchange, so has been a few months. Now that the currency exchange in Guangdong province has been restored, the currency exchange in Jinhua, Yongjia, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang will begin today. Without restriction develop currency exchange bills, now the details of the situation are given in the following part:</p>
<p>Restore Currency Exchange: After Guangzhou became a war zone, because of the unstable local situation, and due to traffic obstruction and inconvenient transportation, the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau immediately stopped developing the entire province's currency exchange for the sake of caution. Now that the situation in Guangdong Province is slightly calm, the Bureau has decided to restore currency exchange in all of Guangdong Province in order to facilitate the public's remittance. There are no restrictions on the amount of remittance, and the remittance fee per yuan varies by location and is detailed. The water supplement fee is one cent per yuan, and telegraphic remittance has also been restored.</p>
<p>Unlimited Remittances: Because the local area is peaceful and business is booming in various counties of Zhejiang Province, such as Jinhua, Lishui, Yin County, Yongjia, Yongkang, Jianxi, and Qu County, various industries have sent people to Shanghai to purchase goods, so the remittance business is quite prosperous. The Shanghai Postal Savings and Winery Bureau has decided to provide convenience to all sectors of the community, starting today, there will be no restrictions on remittances to the above counties. However, the remittance fee per yuan will be calculated at 1/1000th, and the water supplement fee will be half a cent per yuan. In the past, Lishui, Yin County, Yongjia, Yongkang, and Jinhua counties were limited to 1,000 yuan, and Lanxi and Qu County were limited to 500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Cotton from the "Balun" Arrives in Shanghai: An Accident Occurs Upon Arrival, Fortunately, U.S. Navy Sailors Provide Assistance, Preventing Significant Losses <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The "Gran" (transliteration) steamboat from Balun, carrying 3,941 bales of cotton from Ningbo, arrived in Shanghai around 6 a.m. yesterday. After being moored at the Roosevelt Wharf in the New Kai River, smoke suddenly billowed from the cotton hold near the engine room as they prepared to open the hold for unloading. Realizing an accident had occurred, they immediately reported it to the ship owner. The ship owner quickly ordered flags to be raised, intending to summon fireboats for assistance. However, nearby U.S. Navy ships spotted the smoke and promptly dispatched a group of sailors with chemical extinguishers. Upon boarding the ship, they jumped into the burning hold and sprayed the chemicals while simultaneously using water to extinguish the fire. Within minutes, the fire was put out. It was reported that the fire started because the cotton was damp when loaded in Ningbo, and the hold was close to the furnace room. The damp cotton heated up and spontaneously combusted. Fortunately, the fire was detected early, and the U.S. Navy sailors' effective firefighting prevented major losses. Only about 30 bales were affected, with approximately four or five being completely burned. The remaining cotton was also waterlogged during the firefighting efforts, so unloading was suspended yesterday. A public notary was appointed to inspect the cotton for assessing the damage.</p>

<p>Wang Simao, the president of the Second Special District Local Court in the French Concession, was dismissed from his position by the Ministry's order last winter. Yang Qi, the chief prosecutor of the Guizhou Higher Court, was appointed to succeed him in Shanghai. Upon receiving the order, Yang came to Shanghai to take over the position. However, the former president, Wang, had not completed the transfer of duties, preventing Yang from taking office. The Ministry then recalled Yang to Chongqing and ordered Wang to transfer the duties to Yang Peng, the president of the High Court Branch No. 3, who would temporarily take over and concurrently serve as the president. Wang was instructed to handle the transfer of duties and compile the record, which took three months. It has now been completed and is scheduled to be officially transferred to Yang Peng, the president of the High Court Branch No. 3, this morning. This has already been reported. It is said that Yang sent staff to the Special District Court II a few days ago to take inventory. He will formally take office today and will work in the Special District Court II in the mornings and in the High Court Branch No. 3 in the afternoons. It is also rumored that the position of president of the Special District Court II will be filled by another individual named You appointed by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, but this awaits confirmation.</p>

<p>The valiant soldiers of Yao Youyun's, the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 8th Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army in Western Shanghai, captured six male and female traitors in the Chenjia Ferry area of the Suzhou River the day before yesterday afternoon. Among them were Gu Dakui from Shandong, a woman named Xu Yue, and Rui Lu, among others. They confessed to being specifically instructed by the Japanese to spy on the movements of guerrilla squads in the western Shanghai area. Commander Yao was greatly angered upon hearing their confession and immediately verified their identities, executed them on the spot, and hung one or two of the corpses in front of the Shenxin Textile Mill in Zhoujia Bridge to serve as a warning to the public. The remaining three people are currently under close investigation. It is said that one of them, surnamed Guan, is the newly appointed town head of Caojiadu by the puppet "City Government."</p>
<p>Startling Actions by Chinese Forces in the Western Suburbs</p>
<p>The English-language newspaper "The China Press" reported that guerrilla forces in the Shanghai area have taken startling new steps. Last night (the 26th) they once again became active, hanging three Chinese heads on a fence along Brenan Road. This location is near Warren Road within the Japanese-controlled zone, quite far from the boundary of the concession defense area. It is said that the guerrillas told the villagers that people easily forget the shooting of traitors. This time, we beheaded three traitors and hung their heads as a warning to others not to work for the Japanese as traitors. It is not known for sure where the three were beheaded, but heavy gunfire has been heard in several places in the suburbs last night and this morning. Every night, the guerrillas attack the Japanese forces, and some gunfire is definitely heard, but this time the gunfire seemed heavier than usual. This morning and yesterday, Japanese naval units were seen appearing along the west side of Hongqiao Road, presumably launching a counterattack against the guerrillas. Villagers in Beixinjing heard the sound of rifles and machine guns not far away during the curfew. Today at dawn, they went to the market east of Warren Road along Brenan Road and suddenly saw three heads, two women and one man, hanging on the fence next to the Shenxin Textile Mill (currently not in operation). It is not far from the Japanese-controlled area of the concession line, and the guerrillas are becoming active again.</p>
<p>Heads of Two Women and One Man Displayed Publicly</p>
<p>On the night before last, in the area beyond the boundary of Western Shanghai, between Brenan Road and Hongqiao Road, near Warren Road and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, some Chinese guerrillas were discovered. They launched a night attack on the Japanese forces in the area. The Japanese forces, flustered, responded hastily, unable to determine the location of the Chinese forces, and rushed back and forth, exhausted. As a result, the gunfire did not cease throughout the night. The villagers nearby all heard it. At dawn, the Chinese guerrillas completed their mission and immediately organized their troops and headed north. Yesterday morning, several villagers suddenly discovered three heads hanging high on the bamboo fence of the Shenxin Textile Mill on Warren Road. It is said that they were the heads of two women and one man. Next to them was a notice from the Chinese guerrilla forces of the Jihuang Temple, stating that the three executed individuals were traitors who harmed the Republic of China, and they were arrested and executed the night before to uphold the law. Soon, the news spread far and wide, and the Japanese and puppet authorities also learned of it, causing great panic. This area is within the Japanese defense zone, and an anti-traitor case actually occurred. This answers the recent accusations that the Shanghai Municipal Council police force is insufficient.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Two Passenger Cars of the Bank of China Confiscated and Used to Transport Japanese Troops; Returned Only in the Evening <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The dormitory for Bank of China staff is located on Avenue des Soeurs (now Jixiang Road) in Western Shanghai. On weekdays, except for weekly holidays, cars are dispatched twice daily in the morning and evening to transport resident staff to the bank for work or to return home after work. Therefore, the bank specifically prepared two large group cars for exclusive use. Yesterday morning around 8:00 a.m., all the resident staff got up as usual, preparing to take the cars to work. Unexpectedly, they discovered that the above-mentioned vehicles, along with the drivers, had disappeared from in front of the dormitory. They immediately called the head office to inquire, but were told that they had not been dispatched. Discussions arose, but no conclusion was reached. The staff then hired their own vehicles to go to work, while also investigating the matter. Such suspicions persisted, and the reason remained unknown all day. It wasn't until yesterday evening that the two group cars and the drivers returned safely. After questioning, the inside story was revealed. It turned out that the two cars had been suddenly confiscated by a certain military headquarters at the end of Avenue des Soeurs yesterday morning. The drivers had no choice but to obey and were first driven to Hongkou Park, and then to the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou. There, they met two or three hundred soldiers who had just landed and were forced to transport all the soldiers in batches to the area beyond the boundary of Avenue des Soeurs in Western Shanghai. After they got off the cars, they dispersed in various places, seemingly to stand guard. They shuttled back and forth for more than twenty trips, and because they were always under surveillance, they could not move freely. They were only released after the transport was completed.

<p>The home of Zhang Wang's family at No. 8, Lane 242, Zhejiang Road, was invaded by five armed robbers at 9:15 p.m. on the 25th of this month. They ransacked the house, searching through chests and cabinets, and made off with clothing, jewelry, and silver dollars worth approximately 500 yuan. The victim immediately reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, requesting an investigation. The next day at 1:00 p.m., Zhang Wang was having lunch at the Daya Restaurant at No. 580 Fuzhou Road when she suddenly saw a man also eating, whose face resembled that of the robber who had committed the robbery the night before. She secretly reported this to the guard on duty, who relayed the information to the police station. Chinese Detectives Zhang Keqin and Lu Shouchang rushed to the scene and arrested the man. While passing near the Laoguan Police Station and in front of the New Shanghai Company, the arrested man suddenly threw an object from his pocket onto the roadside. The detectives noticed this, picked it up, and found it to be a gold ring inlaid with three diamonds. They brought it back to the police station together with the suspect. Under questioning, he identified himself as Zhang Jingen, a native of Pudong, 26 years old. In his pocket, they found 45.50 yuan in legal tender and seven pawn tickets. The diamond ring he had thrown away was identified by the victim as one of the items stolen during the robbery. Further investigation by the detectives revealed that Zhang lived at No. 6, Yuanfa Inn, No. 13 Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. A handgun and six bullets were confiscated from his residence. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi charged him with robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Law and stated that further investigation into accomplices and other crimes was still needed. He requested that the hearing be postponed for one week. After the victim testified, Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned Zhang briefly and then ordered him to be remanded in custody for a further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Shanghai YMCA Branch: The Truth About a Guest Dispute <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The resident guest Xu Wengui at the Shanghai YMCA Sichuan Road branch was involved in a rental dispute. The truth has been discovered: this guest has been staying at the YMCA since July 14th of last year and has been in arrears of rent for as long as three months. He is neither a member nor has he provided a guarantor. The YMCA has repeatedly urged him to provide a guarantor, but Xu has turned a deaf ear. The YMCA followed its regulations and gave him a deadline to move out, instructing him to leave immediately. At 9 p.m. the night before, Xu attempted to force his way into the dormitory and could not be stopped. The YMCA had no choice but to call the police, who dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene. After questioning and clarifying the situation, they reprimanded Xu. Xu then requested that the YMCA allow him to stay for one more night, but the YMCA staff, bound by regulations, were unable to agree. The staff on duty at the YMCA gave him a small amount of money and instructed him to find another inn to stay in. This ended the disturbance.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Dancing Girl Xie Susu Madly in Love with the Son of a Puppet Official; Arrested Together at the Continental Hotel; Police Charge Them with Hindering Family; Both Claim No Physical Relationship <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Xie Susu, a 19-year-old woman from Ningbo, lost her father when she was six years old, so she lived with her mother, Xie Chen, at No. 11 Chengji Lane, North Zhejiang Road. When Susu was only fifteen, her mother, due to financial circumstances, had her give up her studies and learn to dance. After mastering the art, she went to various dance halls as a dance partner. Two months ago, she started working as a dance partner at the Xuan Palace dance hall on Avenue Edward VII. Recently, Xie Chen heard rumors that her daughter's behavior was improper, so she ordered her to</p>
<p>Stop Dancing and Stay Home. On the 22nd of this month, she suddenly received a phone call from someone claiming to be Wu Changgen, who instructed Susu to continue dancing at the Xuan Palace. Wu is the head of the dance partners at the Xuan Palace dance hall. That evening, Xie Chen accompanied her daughter to the Xuan Palace and learned that the phone call was not made by Wu Changgen, but by someone impersonating him. She did not allow her daughter to dance, but went to the cashier's room to exchange dance tickets and rest briefly. Unexpectedly, when the music started, Susu claimed to be dancing with her girlfriends as a pretext,</p>
<p>And Disappeared. Xie Chen waited until midnight, but her daughter still had not returned. Suspecting something was amiss, she checked the coat and handbag left behind by her daughter and discovered a half-body nude photograph of a man inside the handbag, with a strong body and handsome appearance. Later, according to Western patrons at the hall, they had seen Susu and a young Shen leave together. Xie learned that the man in the photograph was her daughter's lover, Xiao Shen. As it was already late at night, she</p>
<p>Went Home Disappointed. The next morning, Xie Chen, along with two photographs, one of Xiao Shen (Shen Yuchun, 26 years old, from Changzhou, living in the Xin Family Garden on Xin Zha Road, whose father is the section chief of the puppet Consolidated Tax Bureau) and one of her daughter Susu, went to the Chengdu Road Police Station to report the matter. Chinese Detective Cai Yu and Detectives Cui Chengke and Xu Dewei were assigned to investigate. At 5:00 p.m. on the 24th, they discovered that Shen and others were in a room at No. 518 Continental Hotel on Rue Mgr Favier (now East Nanjing Road), so they secretly went to arrest them. At that time, besides</p>
<p>Shen and Xie, there were six friends of Shen in the room. They were questioned and found to be unrelated, so they were not arrested. Only Shen Yuchun and Xie Susu were brought back to the police station. Under questioning, Shen admitted to having a relationship with Xie, and that it was not the first time. This time, they first booked a room at No. 210 Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road and stayed there overnight. The next day, the 23rd, they moved to Room 202 at the Continental Hotel, and on the 24th, they moved to Room 518. Susu also confessed to having a relationship with Shen. The police chief ordered</p>
<p>Shen to be Detained and Xie to be Taken Back by Her Mother. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan detailed the above situation and charged them with hindering family under Article 240, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. According to Xie Chen's complaint and Xie Susu's statement, there was no physical relationship with the defendant. That night, she voluntarily ran away with the defendant because she wanted to marry him, but her mother opposed it. The defendant's friends designed a plan to keep me locked up for a week so that my mother would reconsider</p>
<p>And Approve the Marriage. Her testimony suggests that she still greatly protected the defendant. When questioned, the defendant also stated that there was no physical relationship with Xie, saying that the woman's mother wanted to marry Susu to her nephew as a concubine, but Susu refused, so they went to his place to take temporary refuge. His remaining testimony was evasive, and he hired lawyer Zhang Fukang to defend him. Judge Xiao ruled that the debate in this case was concluded and scheduled the verdict for March 6. The defendant Shen Yuchun was not allowed bail and was remanded to the police station.</p>

<p>At 4:30 p.m. on the day before yesterday, eight robbers, armed with a handgun and a Mauser pistol, stormed into the Wan Shen Pig Shop at No. 21, Lane 118, Zhejiang Road. They threatened the staff not to raise an alarm and made off with approximately 1,080 yuan worth of gold, silver, clothing, and jewelry. At that time, the cook of the shop, Xu Amao, took advantage of the robbers' inattention and followed them. When they passed the intersection of Nanjing Road and Rue Mgr Favier, he secretly reported to Chinese Detective Wang Jiaju and Chinese Police Officer No. 1177, who stepped forward and arrested the thief. He was taken back to the Laozha Police Station. Under questioning, he identified himself as Yang Siqing, a native of Anhui (28 years old). At first, Yang vehemently denied it, but after the victim and others identified him as one of the robbers, Yang confessed to participating in the robbery. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process and requested a postponement to allow for investigation, as the case still required further investigation. After Judge Xiao questioned both sides, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for a further hearing.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, According to Mr. Ye Qirong's entrustment, I was very surprised to read in the Shanghai News section of the Shen Bao on February 27th the news that Ye Qirong used special forces to seize store premises to open a business. After investigation, it turns out that Qirong is a legitimate businessman, and the shareholders of the Datong Cigarette Company, which he co-founded, are Sun Yongquan, Chai Zaiyuan, Yao Runtiao, Rong Yuxiang, Rong Zhenyao, and Sun Wenming. There are no foreign shareholders. This time, because of the embezzlement of funds by his widowed aunt, Liu Chen, who co-founded the Dachangcheng Cigarette Company, Qirong, out of family loyalty, assisted in the investigation, which led to resentment from others. They instigated and fabricated false accusations. Once the investigation and interrogation are completed, the truth will be revealed. The report stated that Qirong reported to the Japanese military and relied on his power to bully others, which is untrue. Furthermore, on the 1st of this month, Qirong was sick in bed. Not only did Qirong not have any disputes with Wang Rongcan and others, but he also never went to Hongkou because he did not have a pass. It is believed that the sections reported are based on inaccurate rumors, and you are requested to send a letter of correction on his behalf. Yours sincerely, Attorney Sun Zuji, addressed to the Shanghai News Editorial Department of the Shen Bao.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Finance Money matters. The higher it goes, the more people buy. Don't sell! Those trading foreign exchange are also doing gold, leading to a new high price of 2,171 yuan. <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash "roasted red" underground market situation was chaotic. First, it rose sharply, then even more so, with unprecedented new highs emerging one after another. It successively broke through the three barriers of 2,150 and 70 yuan, reaching a peak high of 2,171 yuan. This was mainly because the gold price in Tianjin and Beijing had reached a high of 2,230 yuan in counterfeit currency per tael (ten taels). In addition, if the local gold price were calculated according to the Shanghai black market exchange rate, it should have risen to around 2,190 yuan. As a result, those who speculated in foreign exchange also started to speculate in gold. This immediately made people feel excited, and the buying interest also increased sharply. In particular, the Tianjin gang, securities firms, money exchange shops, and brokers were massively purchasing, hoping to make a large profit by transporting it there. Although there were some gold shops and money exchange shops selling on behalf of local firms to profit, the price increases were quite large, soaring upwards. In the end, due to the excessive rise and the sudden selling off by securities firms, coupled with the eagerness of a certain gold firm to sell on behalf of local firms, the market weakened and fell back down. However, the result was a further increase of 19 yuan. Trading was quite active throughout the day, and the price of jewelry gold in silver shops also increased by 2 yuan, creating an unprecedented high price. The prices of Custom gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to decline.</p>
<p>Roasted red rises another 19 yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial asking price for each tael (ten taels) was 2,143-4 yuan, and buyers countered with 37-8 yuan, resulting in a long period without any trading. It was not until 9:45 that a money exchange shop sold 50 taels each to its peers and the northern gang at an opening price of 2,140 yuan. Although some silver shops sold on behalf of multiple accounts to profit after the opening, the northern gang's buying interest was quite strong, and they continued to push towards higher peaks. A silver shop sold 50 taels to a broker at a price of 40 yuan, then sold another 50 taels to the northern gang at 42 yuan, and then sold 50 taels to a money exchange shop at 44 yuan. Subsequently, another silver shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop at 45 yuan. After selling off, the money exchange shop immediately turned around and bought 50 taels from its peers at 46 yuan. Later, the northern gang bought another 50 taels from a money exchange shop at 46.5 yuan. Money exchange shops traded 50 taels among themselves at 47 yuan. Before long, a silver shop sold off again on behalf of multiple accounts to profit, selling 50 taels each to its peers and money exchange shops at a price of 50 yuan. After this, sellers became even scarcer, and the Tianjin gang's desire to purchase remained strong. In addition, a money exchange shop also came to replenish its retail sales, making the rise even more severe. A money exchange shop bought 50 taels from a gold firm at a price that jumped to 60 yuan, and then bought 30 taels from a silver shop at 65 yuan. Subsequently, a broker bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop for the Tianjin gang at 67 yuan, and then bought another 50 taels from the northern gang at the same price. Before long, the northern gang suddenly bought 50 taels from a silver shop at 63 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, the market initially opened as buyers' buying interest remained strong, rising again towards 70. First, a gold firm bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop at 69 yuan. A silver shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop at 70 yuan. A money exchange shop bought 50 taels from its peers at 71 yuan, setting an unprecedented new peak. After this, securities firms suddenly started selling off, and the market turned downward. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a money exchange shop at a price of 69 yuan, and then sold another 50 taels to a money exchange shop at 67 yuan. After this, a gold firm also wanted to sell off on behalf of multiple accounts, but buyers were watching and waiting, and the market continued to weaken. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a silver shop at 2,160 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. Compared to the previous day, the price had increased by 19 yuan (having risen for seven consecutive days, totaling 104 yuan, with a daily price difference of 31 yuan). It was heard that a certain gold firm still wanted to sell after the closing, but although the asking price was lowered to 56 yuan, it was still difficult to find a buyer, so no trading took place. The current selling price of the gold firm's own gold was 2,165 yuan, and the buying price was 2,150 yuan. The current bidding gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no trading took place.</p>
<p>Jewelry gold price increased twice</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops initially remained unchanged. At 11:05, due to the tight potential of "roasted red", it also increased by 1 yuan. Then, at 2:30 in the afternoon, because "roasted red" continued to rise, it increased by another 1 yuan. Da Wen Hang Lao Qingyun and other old firms changed to a rise of 219 yuan, and new firms also changed to 217 yuan, with a buying price of 211 yuan, all creating unprecedented peaks since the market began.</p>
<p>Sino-British pure gold dropped slightly</p>
<p>The People's Bank of China's buying price for Chinese cash continued to fall to 1,209 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed Custom gold price remained unchanged, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard bidding gold price also fell by 7 jiao, calculated at 1,205 yuan and 2 jiao, which was said to be due to the continued reduction of 1 penny per ounce of British pure gold in London on the 25th.</p>
<p>Sudden increase in demand for cash, the discount rate suddenly rose by more than two yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange suddenly increased because of the increasing number of people who need cash, and the need for cash has increased sharply. The supply side is to blame for raising prices, initially reaching 35 yuan or more per thousand yuan, and then reaching 37 yuan and a half. The final value was 37 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, which was 2 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen higher than last Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Although foreign firms settle accounts eagerly, there is absolutely no change in foreign exchange. <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was due to the end of the month for the foreign firms. Therefore, the settlement of accounts of Texaco and British American Tobacco Company was very large. However, foreign banks such as HSBC continued to maintain supply. The foreign telegram also had some supply. In addition, the yarn and flower gangs slightly absorbed the US dollar futures, so the market situation was very mediocre, but the transaction was still strong. Although the foreign firms and foreign banks were closing accounts, the money exchange shops and overseas Chinese were also supplying a lot of supply, so the situation was always unchanged.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the recent London big strips shrank by 0.0625 again, the forward period remained flat, the New York silver price also remained fixed, the London raw gold shrank by one penny, the exchange rate of British currency against the US currency was 2.1%, the French currency was 3.5%, the Shanghai currency remained unchanged, the US currency rose 2.5% against the British currency, 1.25% against the French currency, and 0.8% against the Shanghai currency. The central government's listed exchange rates remained fixed. The bank's opening selling price in the morning was 8.125% for the British currency and 15.875% for the US currency, which was the same as the afternoon closing price last Saturday. After the opening, the market was quite calm, with only a slight trading in currencies of various countries. When HSBC's listed price was announced to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to continue to decrease by 0.25%, calculated at 7.50%, Texaco and British American Tobacco Company suddenly closed each other, but foreign banks were still willing to supply, so the potential was lack of change. Texaco and British American Tobacco Company settled with HSBC at 8.125% for the British currency, and closed with Huabi at 15.875% for the US dollar. Subsequently, the yarn and flower gang absorbed the March US dollar of Huabi and Youli at 15.8125%, so the process was still flat. Near noon, the foreign bank Huayi absorbed the Hong Kong dollar of the money exchange shop at 54.375%, and the situation was also flat. The bank's selling price at noon was the same as the opening price in the morning.</p>
<p>In the later market, Youli first absorbed HSBC's British currency at 8.125%, and then a foreign telegram sold the US dollar to a certain bank at 15.875%. Finally, the foreign firm closed with the overseas Chinese Hong Kong dollar at 54.375%, so the process was not exciting at all. The bank's selling price in the evening was 8.125% for the British currency and 15.875% for the US currency. As a result, the British and US currencies were both without honor or disgrace compared with the afternoon of the previous Saturday, and the Hong Kong dollar also did not rise or fall.</p>
<h3 id="e107">"Roasted red" is almost completely searched, and the market is now pursuing foreign currencies. The US dollar and pound soared by one yuan. <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold fell by one penny, the British and US exchange rates rose by 2.5%, and the foreign exchange of British American Tobacco Company, Texaco, and Fire Company was very large. Foreign banks also absorbed a lot of money for the "North China United Reserve Bank." However, there was occasional throwing of the Hong Kong currency, and the banks' supply was very smooth. The market price remained unchanged, and the situation was very stable. The Tianjin gang's absorption of "roasted red" did not slack off, and the gold shops and money exchange shops searched endlessly on behalf of the wealthy. The market price continued to rise sharply. However, the London pure gold has been declining for several days, and the Hong Kong gold price is only equivalent to 2,190 yuan, which has reached the gold transportation point. Private transportation could not be calculated, so there were many sell-offs. It is feared that the rising trend has reached a high level. Trading was brisk throughout the day, and there were many profits. Everyone laughed and was happy. The British and American gold pounds of foreign currencies rose sharply with the sharp rise in gold prices. The wealthy tried their best to search for them and regarded them as supreme treasures. However, gold coins were scarce and the supply was difficult, so they collected all gold tickets, which caused the market price to tend to rise. However, the exchange rate was stable, so the rise was still small. The trading was extremely strong throughout the day, and the trend was firm. The public association's transactions were very rare. Only Xintai sold Changtai 30 pounds of British gold tickets. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds rose by 7 jiao, British gold tickets rose by 9 fen, US gold pounds rose by 1 yuan, US gold tickets rose by 1 fen and 8 li, Hong Kong tickets rose by 0.5 fen, French franc tickets rose by 7 mao, Singapore tickets rose by 1 fen, Annam tickets rose by 0.5 fen, Canadian tickets rose by 3 fen, Philippine tickets rose by 1 fen, German gold tickets rose by 5 fen, Australian gold tickets rose by 1 jiao. Only Robi tickets, Dutch tickets, Italian gold tickets, and Siamese tickets remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Securities. The public debt market is stable. <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The securities underground market, yesterday's market situation, due to the good environmental news, the market situation is extremely stable. Peaceful news is constantly coming, coupled with the resolution of the Spanish career, the Far East incident can be discussed by the great powers, and the resumption of the exchange is also being actively negotiated. Most people in the market are optimistic. Yesterday, the opening price rose due to retail investors covering short positions and absorbing. The United Union covered short positions, and Tiansheng went long again. The rising trend was very firm. In the middle, No. 38 sold Type B to collect Type C, but failed to receive it. Although Xieda still has a very small number of sell-offs, it has become the end of the strong crossbow. The retail investors absorbed the most, and the future seems very promising. The market price ended up rising by 3.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao. Type D rose by 7 jiao alone because it had not been traded for two days. The total number of transactions was about 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 100 shares of Dasheng Third Factory were traded at a price of 37 yuan, and the rest is still under discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Yarn and Flower. Bullish traders return to raise prices, creating a situation where the opening price falls but the closing price rises. <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the falling trend is becoming more intense. Since the beginning of the red market, the various gangs have not had any active atmosphere. Therefore, the general floating traders, in view of the poor actual digestion, coupled with the fact that the coastal defense transportation does not temporarily ship cotton cloth and cotton yarn, because the warehouses of Yihua, Taikoo, and other foreign merchants have been filled. There is no room for the goods to be shipped in the next batch. Therefore, the wheels stopped loading and waited for dredging, and then they will be shipped as usual. As a result, the yarns that have been pinched in hand have shown a slight state of anxiety. Therefore, the opening price fell more sharply. The lowest price was 390 yuan, which has fallen below the low price of 391 yuan on February 13 last year. However, the industry, such as so-and-so, and the financial community are all in a bullish position, and the time is still in the peak season of spring sales. When the price falls, they come back to raise the price very hard. Therefore, the daily opening is low and the closing is high. In the afternoon, the Yunfu gang slightly activated and purchased, the people's minds were revitalized, and the price rose by another two or three yuan. The spot price of Shuangma is said to be 396 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation of the existing yarn, the opening in the early morning, due to the bad environment, the actual demand of the guest gangs is still sluggish as before. At the same time, the coastal defense cannot be loaded temporarily, and the floating sellers are particularly eager to sell, and the selling is suddenly strong. The opening price fell by 4.5 yuan, and the price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 390 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 387 yuan. Then, the bulls, in view of such a fall, the situation is too fierce, and they came back to raise the price, and the market price slightly rebounded. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuangma went to 392 yuan again. In the afternoon, the Guanggang office went to Yunnan to buy hundreds of bales, and the people's minds turned to high. The market situation turned from weak to strong. As a result, the total number of transactions throughout the day was 1,515 bales, and the transactions among peers still accounted for more than half. The market price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 1.5 yuan compared with the previous day's price, Shuangdiqiu rose by 1 yuan, Tiannv rose by 2 yuan, and Te Jincheng was flat. 40 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai today, 100 pieces were transported to Tianjin, and 85 pieces were transported to Shantou. Also, 500 pieces of yarn came from Tianjin yesterday. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is still lifeless, because the actual sales are still stagnant. The big players are still in a bullish position. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 328 yuan, and the current yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is 325 yuan. The market price slightly recovered in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Foreign cotton trading turns active <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market followed the stock market's strong performance. The cloth trading suddenly turned into a good situation again. The industry is interested in and agrees with Smith's proposal. Washington has been discussing the issue of cotton loans for many days, and the progress is quite smooth. According to general predictions, it may be published next week. As a result, people are extremely excited, and the cotton market feels quite active. The industry has huge transactions. As a result, the cotton market soared by 7-8 pounds. India's forecast rose by one rupee. The Egyptian cotton market was flat. Recently, due to the soaring gold prices, speculators have been buying foreign exchange, so the exchange rate is extending, and the cotton prices converted into legal tender have all risen. The prices of American cotton and Brazilian cotton have risen by 7 jiao per load, the price of Indian cotton has risen by 4 jiao, and the price of Egyptian cotton has also risen by more than 6 jiao.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trading was more active yesterday, but only Xinsheng and Shenxin factories had some transactions. The other factories have not yet started. Everyone expects a large number of transactions to take place next week. Yesterday, Xinsheng Factory ordered 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, including 500 bales of Bairou District, with a factory price of 72 yuan, and 500 bales of Omola, with a factory price of 66.5 yuan. Shenxin Factory entered 100 bales of Bairou District spot goods at a factory price of 69 yuan. Due to the recent sluggish yarn prices, Japanese factories are not enthusiastic about purchasing foreign cotton. Yesterday, only Dakang entered 500 bales of Indian cotton, Gongda entered 500 bales of Indian cotton, and Neiwai Factory entered 500 bales of Indian cotton. The other factories were inactive. The cotton prices yesterday are calculated as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e111">Since arrivals are scarce, flower prices are difficult to relax. <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The native cotton business is still quite good. Factories and firms all have needs, so the market is as stable as ever. The selling price is not weak, but on the contrary, there is a sign of hard rise. The arrival of goods from various places is still without news. Probably the customs in the countryside are still in the midst of entertainment. On the one hand, the road transport is particularly difficult, so the arrival of goods is still lacking. Xinsheng Factory is going to enter 600 pieces of 20-count raw Indian cotton as compensation. Based on this situation, it is speculated that the factories' ordering of foreign cotton is still in full swing, and it is necessary to replenish it. The Yao Hua authorities are inspecting and approving it, and the number of 20,000 to 30,000 bales will soon arrive in Shanghai. The current cotton transaction amount and market price are listed on the left:</p>
<h3 id="e112">Piece goods. Spring sales have not moved. The selling price of cotton cloth has fallen. <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The spring sales of domestic cloth in the stores on this street and the gangs on the nearby roads have not moved. The Sichuan gang bought more than 300 pieces of colored cloth and printed cloth. The mail package was sent out. The Yunnan gang still has the stockpiled goods at the coastal defense, which are waiting to be cleared. The purchase of various goods is temporarily suspended, and the market is quite scattered. However, the situation at the port of eastern Zhejiang is slightly relaxed. The Wenyong gang continues to report and transport the goods that were pre-ordered the year before and the goods that were padded and stored. The Guangdong Shantou gang bought 40 pieces of white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, and more than 100 boxes of colored cloth, crepe, foreign yarn, bleached cloth, and bleached twill. The Fujian gang bought nearly 100 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. The overseas Singapore and other places bought a good stomach. A total of more than 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and dyed cloth were purchased. The selling price of various goods is flat for spring bleaching, printed flowers, and coarse cloth. The price of Qiahe bleached cloth is reduced by 1 jiao, and the price of colored cloth and colored twill from various factories has fallen slightly by 1 jiao to 2 jiao. The hand goods continue to be sold at a lower price, and the market price varies.</p>
<p>Due to the approach of the end of the month and the silver pressure, the brokers' hand goods in Dongbu Baihuo Fine Cloth Fine Twill are loose and abusive, and people are panic-stricken. The selling price is falling across the board. The spot price has dropped sharply by 2 jiao per piece. The 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is sold at a low price of 11 yuan and 9.5 jiao. The Mujie dyeing factory and various wholesale stores in the later market have purchased a lot, and the transaction of various brands of fine cloth has 7-800 pieces, and the fine twill has more than 200 pieces. The market situation is slightly higher, and the asking price for Longtou fine cloth is 12 yuan. However, the Tianjin gang is as quiet as ever, and the market price is even more difficult to approach. Whether the market price can be organic or not, we must wait until the end of the month and then look at the actual sales. Therefore, those who have more bullish thoughts are currently unwilling to sell loosely.</p>
<p>Today, 115 pieces of cloth are transported to Yantai, 60 pieces are transported to Tianjin, and 350 pieces are transported to Shantou.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The woolen cloth market is booming <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for woolen cloth was extremely prosperous. Both buyers and sellers were mostly busy with Yuanbao business, and this year's transactions seemed to be even more prosperous than in previous years. It is a pity that the stock is extremely scarce, and it is regrettable that it is difficult for general brokers to find new colors and it is not easy to obtain large samples.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Food, the customer sales of flour is unabated, and the wheat is as light as ever. <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The flour sales market, the needs of this street are not weak, the old car brand and Fuxin brand and other flours, there are eight or nine thousand bags of transactions per day. The No. 2 flour factory, this street still needs 4.8 yuan, more accommodating for the customer gang's future flour, and the asking price is 4.75 yuan. Yesterday, I heard that Tianjin, Weihai, and Qinhuangdao and other places continued to trade about 30,000 to 40,000 bags of car and ship brands, and 10,000 to 20,000 bags of No. 3 and 4 flour were also opened. The Nanyang gang digested about 10,000 bags. According to flour merchants, the customer gang's appetite is still good, and they all intend to suppress the price to take it, but the factory is now busy with the current bottom is not sufficient for supply, but wants to raise the price, so the transaction is moving but not smooth, and the market is still brewing.</p>
<p>Today, 19,000 bags of flour are transported to Tianjin, 7,000 bags are transported to Fuzhou, and 23,000 bags are transported to Shantou.</p>
<p>There are few arrivals and sales of wheat. In fact, the source of Jingzhen and other places in the Yangtze River is that the production price is too expensive and cannot be allocated. The dealer and the merchant are watching from the sidelines. The previous two days, the arrival of goods was only two or three thousand bags, and the factory's stomach was not opened, because the foreign wheat raw materials are sufficient for application. The need for national wheat is as light as ever, and the total market only opens two or three hundred bags of Jingwu wheat, which is said to be directly sent to the factory, and the price has not changed for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Both the Japonica and Indica rice markets return to flat, and the retail price of foreign rice is high. <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The source of domestic rice, the river has only arrived at No. 4, and more than 3,000 bags of vehicle-transported buns have arrived. The early morning market in the retail and wholesale market still has aftershocks, and the market color continues to be tight. However, in the evening market, after the hoarders stopped, this street immediately turned slack, and the situation softened suddenly. As a result, the market immediately showed a flat, if the price of thick and thin Japonica rice is lacking in honor or disgrace, Du Yangjian and Buzhiyangjian are also flat, and the supply and demand of the Metag are equal, and they are still guarding the original market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, because the weather was clear, the indica rice market reduced the purchase of rice shops and retailers. The total market only bought more than 1,000 bags from various households in this street, and the market price was immediately suppressed by 5 fen. Nanjing high indica rice returned from 11.5 yuan to 11.45 yuan, and the various grades of Wuhu and other middle and second grades were all flat. However, the inventory of foreign rice in the market has been dry for a long time. The bureau's storage rice has been reduced, and it does not want to create and sell it again. However, the retailer is also living strangely and shouting high because the domestic indica has risen. The retail price of Saigon No. 1 rice in the market has been shouted to 15 yuan, which is half a yuan higher than the price of 14.5 yuan before the big end, but the price of 15 yuan includes the commission fee. The Wuhu Jiyuan rice is attracted by the river's variable Yin Yuan, and the arrival is gradually increasing. The middle and second grades yesterday were trending to flat.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Miscellaneous grains, even bean depreciation, sesame is hot <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Dalian soybeans, because the city's market reported a fall, the cargo owners have reduced prices, and as a result, 10 cars were thrown open, the price was 8 yuan, which was 7 or 8 points lower than last week's market. Other Bengbu beans were sold at the original price, 7.5 yuan, and 1 car was sold. Chongming sand yellow only opened more than 500 bags, and the market situation was not much different, and Pinghu Du beans were sold for 300 bags, the price was 9.5 yuan. Although sesame transactions have not been opened in batches, its retail sales market is still continuous, so under the scarce arrival and deposit, the market price has risen by more than 1 yuan compared to last year. Yesterday, 70 bags of Suqian white sesame were purchased from this street, and foreign merchants have not yet started to purchase soy. Yesterday, this street inquired about 100 bags of Zhangjiakou vegetable, the price was 11.5 yuan, and the market situation was slightly declining.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Oil cake, bean cake rise suddenly, the oil market's mentality returns to fatigue <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The bean cake continues to be highly valued, because the guest cakes such as Changzhou's Xiefeng Wulong cake and Pully's Feizi cake have been reported to be non-existent, the source is not connected, and the factory cake is also only one factory for supply, so the market atmosphere is sharp. Yesterday, 7 or 8,000 pieces were collected from the Xiamen Quanzhou gangs, the price was 3.36 yuan, which was 6 cents higher than last Saturday, and the total trend has not been slightly reduced.</p>
<p>The bean oil was soft because of the continuous drop in the corners, and the mentality in the market returned to soft. A total of more than 800 pieces of various oils were traded, and although the peanut oil price did not move, the market atmosphere was still brewing. 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Sugar market, domestic grain transactions return to Qing <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat. The association's disk, the 24th Dutch coarse white was slightly soft, and 1-200 bags of foreign warehouse goods were sold at 24.35 yuan, 24.55 yuan for this warehouse goods, and 16.25 yuan for re-export goods. After the price of domestic sugar rose for several days, the industry did not dare to be greedy because the appetite from all parties was not yet too strong, so the market opened again in a quiet manner. The Chao gang only opened a spectrum of 200 bags of ice flower white, the higher one was 23.86 yuan, the second one was 42 jiao, and the Guang gang opened 100 bags of Hainan red, 13.9 yuan. Jian gang Diaogqing has been exchanged, and the market will be available in the near future, and its momentum has a tendency to relax.</p>
<h3 id="e119">North and South goods, Dalianzi's asking price turns up <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The stock of black melon seeds is the thinnest, so the momentum has not been reduced, and it is difficult for Dalianzi to have the color of a certain product, and those who do it are less common, but the trend is also tight. Yesterday, I heard that the price has been increased by 1 yuan, the price is 25 yuan to 26 yuan, and a certain guest's goods that were stored last year are called up to 27.5 yuan, because the goods are inferior, and there is a temporary lack of hands to receive it.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Seafood, Yantai dried scallops are not sufficient in stock <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Wenzhou open ocean market is stable</p>
<p>Yantai dried scallops, the previous market sold for 340 yuan per load, because the source is scarce, its momentum is getting tighter, and in terms of import, it is necessary to buy the foreign exchange first and then handle the goods, so the general industry regards it as a difficult road, resulting in a lack of accumulation. The market has been shouting 370 yuan, and it is expected to be able to become a market in the near future.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain store in Wenzhou sold more than 10 loads of Kaiyang, the price of which was 75.5 yuan, which was not much different from the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Medicinal materials, Sichuan orange network is expanding upward again <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Since the national army withdrew from Sichuan, traffic has been obstructed, the source is difficult, relying on parcel delivery, the quantity has been greatly reduced, the cost is more cumbersome, and the time is delayed, so last year, those who had inventory in the industry were all overjoyed. Check the Sichuan orange network, the highest underground price was 60 yuan per catty, until the end of the winter, it fell to 16 yuan, and recently it was sold for 20 yuan, and it rose by 4 yuan, which is quite hot.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Paper, tin foil market outlook is bullish <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The digestion of tin foil red dishes is very good, and the door market is particularly lively, so yesterday the selling price of each piece in the door market has been increased by 2 points, and the current stock is gradually decreasing, and the source is rare due to the inconvenience of transportation, and a part of the medium-grade goods is even more lacking, so the people in the industry predict that the wholesale price must rise soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 36,140 pieces of native paper came from Wenzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Coal, Yan Qiao has no goods supplied <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>I had to use No. 2 to make up the number</p>
<p>The rising wind of Yanmei's shavings is getting more and more intense, people's minds are shaken, and the customer sales are booming. The large and small factories all have to be unimpeded every day, so the stock on the market has gradually been sold out. Kai Ping special shavings are called up to 40 yuan, and there are no goods supplied. I had to ask for the next best thing and use No. 2 shavings to make up the number. The price of the same industry dismantling price must also be 34 yuan. Other such as Keelung shavings 36 yuan, Songpu shavings 37 yuan, are also consistent. The continued rise in coal prices in the spring was really unexpected.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Imports and exports, a large number of Yao flowers are coming from the source <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday, the New York market was closed. Yokohama saw extreme price surges again. Spot prices opened at 1,000 yuan in the morning and closed at 1,025 yuan in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 25 yuan. Futures opened at 967 yuan in the morning and closed at 985 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 38 yuan compared to Saturday morning, marking an unprecedented surge. Market prices were also approaching extreme levels, leading to speculation that the surge was related to the Japanese currency issue. The local silk market was extraordinarily enthusiastic. Silk traders, due to the chaotic price increases, adopted a wait-and-see attitude. White silk from factory grades 7 and 8 had already reached 1,750-1,760 yuan. The price of dry cocoons has soared to 400 yuan. However, calculated with 400 catties of white silk reeling, the silk cost has been pulled to 1,680 yuan, plus 60 yuan for reeling labor, the cost of each dan of raw silk has combined to 1,740 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk trading was firm and clear, with printing shops being more active. Early grade dried mulberry silk sold for 1,000 yuan, and Qi Li local silk sold for 720 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. Sales of white silk to England, France, and America have not yet started and are far off. Although the sentiment in the user silk market is extremely firm and positive, buyers are hesitant. Conversely, unemployed capital is actively engaged in speculative activities.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Poverty and Illness <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>The words "poverty and illness" are often used together by people in general; poverty and illness seem to have a close relationship.</p>
<p>Indeed, these two, poverty and illness, do have an inextricable and rapidly multiplying relationship in fact; sometimes they are simply used as a two-in-one special term.</p>
<p>Illness caused by poverty is a very common thing; poverty caused by illness is also a natural consequence. The poor are not only more likely to get sick, but also harder to cure when they are sick: because illness can make the poor even poorer, the lack of medical care often results in the loss of the patient's life, and at the same time, it also cuts off the livelihood of the patient's family. The mutual relationship between poverty and illness is like this.</p>
<p>The so-called poverty refers to economic inadequacy or lack, and illness refers to violating normal physiological health, or abnormal pathology. Handling and treating violations of normal physiological health is medicine. However, medicine for treating diseases cannot be done without money. Therefore, for the rich patients, money is not a problem, and medicine for treating the sick body is not a problem; for the poor, it becomes a problem. What problem? Isn't it obviously an "economic problem"! Without the price of money, you can't get medicine to treat the sick body! This, it seems, is the reason why illness is not a problem for the rich, but a problem for the poor; it seems to be the reason why poverty and illness are so interrelated.</p>
<p>Not only in terms of words do they have such a mutual relationship, but in fact, "poverty and illness" has also become an important issue in social problems.</p>
<p>You see, isn't there a call for "relief of poverty and illness" in society?</p>
<p>Following this, we in the medical community have responses such as "preferential treatment for the poor and sick," "reduction of fees for the poor and sick," and "free treatment for the poor and sick."</p>
<p>However, although the call for relief of poverty and illness is high, the actual benefits to the poor and sick who are relieved are not obvious; although the measures for preferential treatment of the poor and sick are good, the actual benefits obtained by the poor and sick are also very minimal. What is the reason? The reason is that it is difficult to cure illness, and it is even more difficult to relieve poverty. "Poverty" is the real cause of illness for the poor and sick. The difficulty in curing the illness of the poor and sick is already a reality, and the fact that they are prone to relapse after recovery due to poverty is also a fact. Therefore, under the current social organization, "relief of poverty and illness" and "preferential treatment of the poor and sick" are not fundamental solutions to poverty and illness; however, under this economically interlocked current social organization, it is necessary to have these methods, which are not thorough but better than nothing.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the current society, methods such as "relief of poverty and illness" will inevitably continue to be retained, and slogans such as "preferential treatment of the poor and sick" in the medical community will also exist as usual.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the words "poverty and illness" will also continue to be applied forever along with the existence of the current society.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Scorched Earth Policy in Epidemiology (Part 2) <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhenxun</p>
<p>However, regarding the epidemic prevention part, it is different. As long as everyone earnestly does it, whether it is a fortified wall or a scorched earth, thorough results can be obtained. Aren't the precedents of various European and American countries ironclad evidence? This is because the hygiene issues that ordinary people should pay attention to are numerous and complicated, and it is inevitable to attend to one thing and lose sight of another. However, in terms of epidemic prevention, although the types of epidemics vary greatly, the causes of epidemics are generally nothing more than germs. All germs have certain common properties. Knowing the common properties of germs makes it not difficult to deal with them appropriately. These common properties can be divided into two points. First, germs enter the human body. Initially, because there is no resistance in the body, it is indeed unavoidable to suffer from it, either getting sick or even dying. However, if you get sick but don't die, then antitoxins are produced in the body, which in turn eliminate the bacteria. Not only does the disease gradually recover, but when the same kind of bacteria comes to invade a second time, you will have something to rely on and not be afraid. Therefore, to avoid germ invasion, it is best to have a mild illness first. Second, the life of germs always depends on the patient's body. If they leave the patient, they will not develop or easily reproduce. Therefore, the root of epidemic transmission lies entirely in already sick patients. If there are no patients with this type of epidemic in the entire environment, then there is nothing to fear from its spread. In short, the problem of epidemic prevention is simpler than general hygiene. We only need to find ways to address those two common properties of germs, and it will not be difficult to achieve the ideal goal. On the one hand, everyone should try to contract a mild illness, so that the body can develop sufficient antitoxins to achieve the effect of a fortified wall; on the other hand, everyone should strive to clear the fields, removing the already sick people, so that they will not infect and harm others. Although the two aspects seem to contradict each other, those who fortify the walls hope to contract the disease, while those who clear the fields are extremely afraid of contracting the disease. Isn't this a big contradiction? In fact, it is not. The above is just theory. If we seriously implement it according to epidemiology, there are proper ways to avoid mutual contradictions. In the following, we might as well go a step further and talk about some general methods of fortified walls and scorched earth that are practical in epidemiology.</p>
<p>If you want to use contracting a mild illness to generate enough antitoxins to achieve the goal of a fortified wall, our ancient Chinese method of variolation has been doing just that. However, although smallpox can be inoculated, other infectious diseases cannot necessarily be inoculated. Moreover, the onset of disease after inoculation is not necessarily mild. Sometimes, lives are sacrificed as a result. Therefore, epidemiology has now abandoned the practice of introducing lively bacteria into the body like ancient variolation, which is completely the same as natural infection. It is appropriate that there are many abuses and great dangers. The smallpox that we now inoculate is modified using cowpox vaccine, the content of which is not the living bacteria of smallpox, but is made using the bacteria of cowpox. Although the resistance produced after inoculation with cowpox vaccine does not last as long as that of ancient variolation, it is actually free from any abuses and there is no need to worry about any unexpected dangers. As for other epidemics, although there are no alternatives to smallpox that can be used with cowpox bacteria, as research has progressed, it is now known that dead bacteria can also be used to trigger the body's reaction and produce antitoxins, with no difference from living bacteria. In this way, cholera bacteria, typhoid bacteria, meningitis bacteria, plague bacteria, diphtheria bacteria, and scarlet fever bacteria can all be inoculated in the same way. Although the method is somewhat different from inoculation, inoculation only requires planting the bacteria within the skin layer, while dead bacteria must be planted under the skin to be effective. Therefore, it is necessary to use the injection method to inject them. However, this injection under the skin is only different in procedure, and the result is the same: it triggers a reaction and produces antitoxins, which can also resist the invasion of living bacteria. From this point of view, the current application of dead bacteria to achieve the goal of a fortified wall does not in any way contradict the work of clearing the fields.</p>
<p>As for the work of clearing the fields, the focus is on removing already sick patients. In epidemiology, very appropriate methods are also stipulated, which is the isolation method currently used worldwide, which is handled by local agencies. On weekdays, pay attention to patients with similar epidemic symptoms at any time. If there is any suspicion, immediately isolate them. Not only the sick person is sent to the isolation hospital for examination and treatment, but also the patient's family and neighbors must be isolated from society. Whether it is people or things, they are not allowed to communicate with outsiders. They must undergo environmental disinfection, and everyone must be vaccinated with cowpox or injected with the appropriate dead bacteria, and wait for the antitoxins to develop before they are allowed to be free. Isn't this a reliable method of clearing the fields? Extrapolating from this, in epidemiology, the two ends of fortified walls and clearing the fields are indeed easier to be more thorough than general hygiene. Unfortunately, in our China, because scientific knowledge has not yet been popularized, everyone regards vaccination and injection as a daunting task. Regarding the isolation method, isolating patients and related people from the world like prisoners is even more frightening, and may even be considered unreasonable, which leads to the spread of epidemics. Recently, hasn't Shanghai been regarded as a smallpox port? If everyone is willing to be vaccinated seriously, and all patients with smallpox are willing to enter the isolation hospital, then the epidemic of smallpox would have been reduced long ago, and the bad reputation of the smallpox port would not have been publicized. Because of this feeling, I am using this journal to announce the truth, hoping that everyone will quickly follow the fortified walls and clearing the fields methods in epidemiology to implement them, and the harvest of the evening sun is not too late.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Common Knowledge of BCG Vaccination for Tuberculosis Prevention <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yongchun</p>
<p>This publication has received many letters from readers inquiring about the details of BCG. Here is a summary of the answers:</p>
<p>(1) BCG was invented by French microbiologist Professor Calmette and his colleague Mr. C. Guerin. The two researchers used a bovine tuberculosis bacterium and, after more than 20 years of special cultivation, made it non-pathogenic while preserving its immunizing effect.</p>
<p>(2) The Pasteur Institute in Shanghai is currently manufacturing this vaccine (currently only one type for oral use). It is provided to doctors free of charge in Kunshan, but it is not given to non-doctors.</p>
<p>(3) The Shanghai Guangci Hospital has vaccinated more than 800 infants in the past year, with very good results.</p>
<p>(4) China is not the only place using this bacteria; Mr. Wang Liang in Chongqing has been making and using this vaccine for six or seven years.</p>
<p>(5) The method of oral vaccination with BCG is very simple. Within ten days after the infant's birth, every other day (the third, fifth, and seventh days after birth, or the fourth, sixth, and eighth days are all acceptable), half an hour before morning feeding, mix BCG with warm milk and have the infant drink it. One ampoule each time, for a total of three doses, but this method can only be used for infants within ten days of birth, and it is less effective for older children.</p>
<p>(6) Older children must use the subcutaneous injection method. This injection procedure is more complicated, and sometimes cold abscesses may form after injection, but this type of abscess is not dangerous and often heals without medication.</p>
<p>(7) Vaccination, whether oral or subcutaneous, must be done by a doctor. Before and after vaccination, the vaccinated person must often be isolated, and the doctor uses tuberculin for a skin test (this reaction is positive in those containing tubercle bacillus) to determine the appropriate treatment based on the results of the reaction.</p>
<p>(8) This vaccine has been tested on animals countless times, and more than two million people have been vaccinated. Those who use this vaccine all say that it is harmless and effective.</p>
<p>(9) Important Chinese literature on this vaccine is listed below: How to Vaccinate with Calmette-Guerin Bacillus to Resist Tuberculosis (Chinese Medical Journal, Volume 20, Issue 12); Overview of B.C.G. Vaccination of Infants in Chongqing (Tuberculosis Prevention Monthly, Volume 2, Issue 4); A Glimpse of B.C.G. Vaccination in Sichuan Province (Medical and Pharmaceutical Review, Volume 8, Issue 9); Outline of BCG Vaccination for Tuberculosis Prevention (Aurora Medical Journal, Volume 16); Various Aspects of BCG Anti-Tuberculosis Vaccination in Far Eastern Countries (ibid.); Preliminary Results of the Shanghai BCG Vaccination Infant Trial (Aurora Medical Journal, Volume 24).</p>

<h3 id="e132">A Shallow Discussion of Rights <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>It is common for people to enjoy rights but not be willing to fulfill obligations. Therefore, when it comes to rights, they must be fought for, and when it comes to obligations, they must be avoided. In their minds, they always think that enjoying rights is a pleasure, and fulfilling obligations is a pain, but they do not know that enjoying rights has its pleasures, and fulfilling obligations has even more rare and supreme pleasures; they do not even know that rights are obligations, and obligations are rights.</p>
<p>The ancients said that doing good is the greatest happiness, and the Western Bible also says that helping people is the greatest happiness. Doing good, including helping people, is what people generally call obligations. Therefore, the fact that doing good is a pleasure has been proven by ancient sages and virtuous men. If you don't believe it, you can try it; if you believe it but don't understand why, you can try it even more. Experience everything personally, and you will understand the truth, so I don't need to waste my words.</p>
<p>Rights are definitely not falling from the sky; obligations will definitely not be fulfilled in vain. The two are mutually causal, and broadly speaking, they are originally two-in-one and one-in-two things. I don't have time to explain them in detail now, so I will first give the example of military service to prove that obligations are also rights.</p>
<p>In the minds of rigid and outdated people, military service is always thought to be a bitter chore. Because it involves life, it is always thought to be more terrible than any other obligation and cannot be compared with rights. However, although the constitutions of most countries now stipulate that military service is an obligation, scholars believe that military service is a right of citizens. Since military service is not considered an obligation but a right, foreigners are not allowed to enjoy it, just as foreigners are not allowed to enjoy the right to own property.</p>
<p>We can also avoid talking about legal principles and only think about the facts. If robbers break into your house to rob your property and bully your family, you have to desperately protect all of this. This is certainly your obligation, but are you willing for others to take your place and fulfill this obligation for you? The small can be used to illustrate the big: a country is also equivalent to a family. You and your children have to serve in the military for the country, which is of course enjoying rights, not fulfilling obligations, because foreigners cannot openly take your place to replace you.</p>
<p>Individuals and the country have already become an integrated whole in modern times, sharing weal and woe. Protecting the country is protecting yourself, which everyone is already familiar with. I am specifically pointing this out because this is our right. In our minds, we must be prepared and practice to enjoy it.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Children's Corps <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Green Leaf</p>
<p>There are many situations in the guerrilla areas that are enough to inspire people and make them believe that our country's war of resistance can definitely be victorious and that our nation can definitely be revived. Among them, the one that makes the deepest impression is the Children's Corps.</p>
<p>In a certain guerrilla area, most of the children from eight to fifteen years old have joined the "Children's Corps." The "coaches" in charge are sent from the formal guerrilla team. They not only have military knowledge, but also general knowledge. They start with the villages. A larger village or town, or a smaller two or three villages, can usually recruit fifty or sixty children to form a small team. Several small teams are combined into a medium team, and several medium teams are combined into a large team, all under the command of the "Headquarters."</p>
<p>Joining the team is voluntary, not forced. But once you join, you can't leave casually. Each team member has two or three copper coins of "pay" every day, and the team leader has more, from five to ten coins. There are also occasional rewards such as candy and pancakes, if they train well or win a "battle." After joining, if you want to leave halfway, the parents of that child have to compensate for all the "pay" and rewards.</p>
<p>The team members' weapons are wooden guns, wooden sticks, bamboo poles, and any other suitable things. But the team leader and others also have "guns." These guns use copper tubes from bullets, filled with gunpowder, with a small hole underneath to pass the fuse, and are tied to short sticks to make them. However, this thing can only be used as a command or to boost morale, not to fire at people, because it is too easy to seriously injure people if it is too close.</p>
<p>The team members' work is, first, "going to the classroom," second, "going to the training ground," and third, "going to the battlefield."</p>
<p>Some are every night, and some are every other night. All the team members have to gather in the designated square, or field, or graveyard, or wilderness, and the coach gives a speech: reporting on current events, explaining the mission of the Children's Corps, and so on. After the speech, training begins. It is completely military training, not ordinary training in small schools. Of course, they also teach singing. It is best to have moonlight, otherwise they light pine oil to make torches.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to carry out combat. First, the coaches of this team and that team agree in advance on when and where to start the battle. When that day and time arrives, mostly at night, the two teams set off separately. The "assault team" is in front, the main team is behind, and other reconnaissance and ambushes are also available. Therefore, on the one hand, it is a competition of strength, and on the other hand, it is a competition of intelligence.</p>
<p>When the two teams meet, both sides can use the weapons in their hands to attack the "enemy." Of course, it is also common to "fight" without weapons, using fists and toes to twist into a ball. Crying is not allowed when it hurts, and parents are not allowed to speak if clothes are torn, shoes fall off, heads are broken, and blood flows. The team that is "disarmed" or the team that runs away is considered to have lost, and the winning team comes back singing with "spoils of war."</p>
<p>Because there are often small incidents such as bloodshed, there is also a medical team in the team, with the necessary supplies and knowledge.</p>
<p>The children all understand why they have to "fight" like this, and their parents know even more the meaning of "fighting" like this. In a word, it is to prepare to deal with their real enemies. Therefore, since it was launched last autumn, it has been more than half a year now. In various places, "fighting" has been unknown how many times. Some boast that their heads and hands are full of scars, and their clothes are full of holes. They themselves are not afraid, and their parents do not stop them, and there have never been any unpleasant disputes.</p>
<p>During the day, they sometimes have rallies. The teams are arranged very neatly, singing "military songs," and walking in the towns. Some bold ones even marched to places two or three miles away from the city. When they saw their real enemies appear, they threw their "weapons" on the ground and dispersed to play. The enemies saw them and did not know what they were doing, and because they were all children, they had to let them go.</p>
<p>In addition to formal gatherings and intensified training, they also gather several neighboring children at home whenever they are free, and each does individual training, such as wrestling, hitting sandbags, high jump, long jump, etc.</p>
<p>In short, these children, in addition to their normal services in the family or school, are also receiving thorough and active military training. Although they are young now, they will become strong men in the blink of an eye. When they become strong men, because they have received such training since they were young, it is very convenient for them to fight guerrillas or join the regular army. The "little devils" in the Eighth Route Army and the Fourth Route Army can be said to be such children. However, the "little devils" are separated from their families and are completely "little soldiers," while they are at home, preparing to be soldiers in the future, and there are these differences.</p>
<p>This is what I know about a certain town in a certain county in a certain guerrilla area. I don't know what other towns, counties, and areas are like. But I believe that the authorities must have a general plan, and other places are also proceeding in the same way.</p>
<p>Very good, the enemy is making a deep-seated hatred with us, so let us take revenge. The "Children's Corps" is the starting point for taking this revenge.</p>
<p>After reading yesterday's "Departure," I couldn't help but feel sorry for the innocent children. But after reading today's "Children's Corps," we are happy for them again. And the number of "departures" is ultimately small, the number of "Children's Corps" is ultimately large, and the "departure" is not willing, so we are fully optimistic about our future soldiers. ——Editor.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Encouraging People to Do Good <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Pei</p>
<p>Christian pastors are most unwilling to hear people say they are merely encouraging people to do good. They say that encouraging people to do good is just that—encouragement. Whether the person does good or not has nothing to do with the one who encourages them. The one who encourages does their best to encourage and does nothing else. They consider their work to be more than just encouragement; they say they are guiding people to do good, even pulling them to do good.</p>
<p>The people we often see in society who encourage others to do good generally fall into the following three categories:</p>
<p>The first type are monks and Taoists who eat from all directions. To their "encouragement," they add a "soliciting," meaning soliciting donations. Thus, "good" becomes "giving money for merit." No matter how great a sinner or evildoer one is, as long as they listen to their entreaties and donate generously, they can immediately become a spotless lamb. The second type are degenerate sons who indulge in prostitution, gambling, and eating, and who, in their old age, suffer greatly and even beg for a living. They often deeply repent to their children—if they have any—or any younger generation, urging them to do good and not to follow their example, in order to gain people's sympathy. The third type are hooligans and bachelors who have become bosses. In the days when they had only a pair of pants and a rope, they committed all kinds of evil. Once they rise to prominence and open a public stove, a bathhouse, or even engage in some major enterprise, they will encourage people to do good, hinting at their "good deeds being rewarded," and telling people not to have any improper thoughts about their wealth or status, nor to ask for a share of the spoils.</p>
<p>The first type owns nothing themselves and wants to make a living by encouraging others to do good. The second type originally owned something, but now they have lost it all and want to eke out a living by encouraging others to do good. The third type originally owned nothing, but now they have gained a little or a lot and wants to maintain the status quo by encouraging others to do good. In short, encouraging others to do good is about filling one's own belly.</p>
<p>These we will set aside for now. Unexpectedly, new tricks have appeared in the world recently, and there is another kind of encouraging people to do good. If someone is eating a meal, he snatches it away, saying, "This meal is poisonous; let me throw it away for you." But secretly, he swallows the stolen meal. If someone is sleeping soundly in their house, he drives them away, saying, "Robbers are coming; let me guard it for you." But secretly, he steals everything in the house. If someone is interacting with a friend, he says, "This friend is unreliable," and insists on cutting off their relationship, while he himself continues to interact with that friend without end. There are many, many such behaviors, so numerous that they could never be fully described. But he always tells others, "I'm doing this for your own good, to protect you, to keep you safe and happy. I am your best friend."</p>
<p>Initially, it was also only to fill their own bellies that they engaged in these acts of encouraging people to do good. But these actions are far beyond what monks, degenerate sons, and hooligans can do, because the methods used by monks, etc., are still soft, while his are hard. Those who are encouraged by monks are free to ignore them, and the monks can do nothing about it. But those who are encouraged by him are simply overwhelmed with gratitude, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, and feel compelled to listen. He has long since gone beyond the scope of "encouragement" and entered the realm of "pulling." He truly has the "zeal" of a Christian pastor.</p>
<p>However, whether it's monks, degenerate sons, hooligans, or any other type, even if you did listen to them, it could at least be construed as doing good. But listening to those people who are encouraging, and pulling, you to do "good" could only lead to your downfall, to being buried with no place to rest your bones. It is no wonder that those who are "encouraged" do not listen, and those who are "pulled" must resist. He is ultimately not encouraging people to do "good," but is "encouraging" people to do "evil"!</p>
<p>Seeing this situation cannot help but make one sigh: things in the world are becoming more and more strange. However, when monks and others encourage people to do good, there is still some humanity involved, and there can still be room for survival among humans. But this kind of person who encourages people to do evil is simply an unparalleled demon, and sooner or later humanity will have to eradicate them!</p>
<h3 id="e136">A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Tales of Ethnic Novels</p>
<p>"A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes" is a novel with the theme of Zhaojun's marriage to the Xiongnu. There is indeed an abundance of literature on Wang Zhaojun. Taking "Qingzhong Zhi" edited by Hu Danfeng as an example, there are more than four hundred poems praising Wang Zhaojun. In terms of vernacular literature, there is the "Biography of Mingfei." In terms of drama, there are also four Yuan zaju plays: Ma Zhiyuan's "Autumn in the Han Palace," Guan Hanqing's "Crying Zhaojun," Zhang Shiqi's "Zhaojun Departs the Border," and Wu Changling's "Zhaojun Escapes by Moonlight." Unfortunately, all but "Autumn in the Han Palace" have been lost. Ming and Qing chuanqi plays include "The Story of Peacemaking" and "The Story of Qingzhong," as well as Zhou Wenchuan's "The Language of the Pipa." Ming and Qing zaju plays include Chen Yujiao's "Zhaojun Departs the Border" (included in the first collection of Shengming zaju plays is actually "Zhaojun Departs the Border," Zhang Gong's "Wang Zhaojun" mistakenly believed it was "The Story of Peacemaking," see Lingnan Journal, volume 2, issue 2), You Tong's "Lament for the Pipa," and Xue Dan's "Zhaojun's Dream." The latter two are included in "Newly Compiled Zaju Plays," and Zhen Duo discovered the complete collection a few years ago. The various dramas mentioned above have been listed in Zhang Shulin's "Bits and Pieces of the Evolution of the Story of Wang Zhaojun" (Yanjing University Literary Annual, first issue) and Huang Qixiu's "The Evolution of the Story of Wang Zhaojun" (Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University Folklore Weekly, issues 121 and 122). However, the late-emerging chuanqi play "A Romance of Two Phoenixes" seems to have written things that other scholars have not studied. The Yushuangyi Collection has a manuscript copy of this chuanqi. Du Yingtao's "Notes on Manuscript Opera Works in the Yushuangyi Collection" in the Journal of Dramatic Studies says: "A Romance of Two Phoenixes, one volume, undivided, author's name not recorded, depicts the story of Wang Zhaojun, the same as the popular 'A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes' novel. Originally in two volumes, upper and lower, this copy only contains the upper volume, with twenty scenes, ending with Li Ling copying and executing Mao Yanshou's family members, the lower volume is missing." It is likely that this play was written after "A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes."</p>
<p>In terms of novels, it seems that there is only "A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes," which is not recorded in Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Popular Novels." It has eighty chapters, and Zhang Shulin believes it was published in the mid-Qing Dynasty, and there is a popular version. This book largely takes from "Autumn in the Han Palace," "The Story of Peacemaking," and "Qingzhong Ji" and slightly alters them.</p>
<p>"For example, 'Autumn in the Han Palace' writes that Zhaojun plays the pipa herself, which Yuan Emperor hears," and thus favors her. The novel changes it to being heard by Empress Lin, and then the empress pleads with Yuan Emperor, adding another layer of twists and turns. A line in "Autumn in the Han Palace" says: "A flaw appears in the autumn waves of her jade-like eyes." The novel says, "A sesame-sized black mole is drawn under the eyes in each portrait."</p>
<p>"The Story of Peacemaking" says that Zhaojun draws her own portrait, which the novel also does. "The Story of Peacemaking" says that palace maid Xiao Shanyin marries in place of Zhaojun, which the novel also does, only the name of the palace maid is different. "The Story of Peacemaking" writes that Zhaojun appears in a dream after her death, asking Yuan Emperor to summon her younger sister Wang Xiuzhen, which the novel also does, only Wang Xiuzhen's name is changed to Sai Zhaojun.</p>
<p>Only the scenes of departing the border and sending Zhaojun remain in "Qingzhong Ji." Recently, Xianni Society's Chuan Ming and Hua Chuanhao have performed it several times, and the dance is very good. It says that the imperial brother Wang Long sends Zhaojun, and the novel also follows this saying, only changing Wang Long to Liu Wenlong (the same name as the protagonist of "Little Uprising").</p>
<p>In this way, "A Bizarre Romance of Two Phoenixes" can be said to be a compilation of legends.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Causes and Treatments for Post-Marital Kidney Deficiency in Men <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Kidney deficiency is the thief of love between couples and the messenger of shortened lifespan.</p>
<p>Once a married man has kidney deficiency, the love between husband and wife is greatly affected. Because husband and wife are the union of sexual relations, a vigorous man marrying a beautiful woman will not live a sweet life. Therefore, the love between husband and wife is strong, giving birth to clever and healthy children, and organizing a happy and joyful family. What a happy thing this is! If a man has kidney deficiency, a disease of dissipated energy, then the life of husband and wife cannot be fulfilled, and their love will inevitably be hit hard. In recent newspapers and magazines, or in conversations after tea and wine, one can often hear and see cases of marital disputes or court divorces because the husband is unable to consummate the marriage, and the wife wastes her youth and cannot bear the sacrifice. In addition, the husband's kidney deficiency is left untreated, causing his body to gradually weaken, and he dies of illness! Leaving orphans and widows behind, according to a statistic and study of youth death made by a physician, there are also alarming numbers! Therefore, the disease of kidney deficiency in married men is indeed a serious problem that modern physicians should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Why do men often have kidney deficiency after marriage? The reasons are mostly due to masturbation and nocturnal emission during the period of spring passion, or the excessive indulgence in sex after marriage. As for excessive use of the brain or work injuries, congenital weakness or imbalance after illness, etc., there are also occasional reasons. In the early stages of this disease, there are usually no obvious abnormalities on the outside. Subsequently, it is often accompanied by neurasthenia and decreased metabolism. Therefore, symptoms such as headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, backache, seminal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, sallow complexion, fear of cold and heat, and mental lethargy follow one after another, and one is trapped in depression and fatigue all day long. The pain of life is difficult to describe!</p>
<p>Regarding the most effective and effective treatment for this disease, according to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, everyone unanimously praises the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin." This agent is based on factual needs and is made into a medicine by countless world medical experts who have exhausted their lifelong experience, mutual research and experimentation, and is extracted from the bodies of strong animals such as apes and orangutans. The result is the effect of getting rid of disease, prolonging life, and rejuvenating youth. It shocked the world of medicine. The most meritorious person for the invention of this agent is Dr. Stanner, a European physiologist, so this agent is named "Stanner's Gonadin." It is true that this medicine is pure in quality, has the nature of a king's way, and has a positive tonic effect. After taking it, it can produce essence, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood, nourish nerves, and promote metabolism in one day and night. There are no side effects such as irritating the stomach and intestines or stimulating nerves. If you continue to take it, you will definitely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can prolong your life. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Himitol's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the essence gate and prevent leakage, then the effect will be faster. If patients can come to this clinic in person for diagnosis by expert physicians, and then use scientific treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Sorrow of Untreated Seminal Emission and the Need for Salvation <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>The most common problem that every man is prone to in his youth is undoubtedly masturbation. This problem of masturbation is very simple and contemptible, but once a young man touches it, it is easy to become a habit. Once the habit is formed, it is like being addicted to smoking. Although one knows the harm, one cannot completely quit. Because one cannot completely quit, the youth gland is destroyed, the essence gate is relaxed, and what follows is seminal emission.</p>
<p>From a health point of view, seminal emission is the most harmful to the brain, sex, and spinal cord nerves, so once a young man suffers from this evil disease, his thinking power will decline sharply. At the same time, there is poor memory, backache, tinnitus, palpitations, night sweats, and other symptoms, and what is especially frightening is that the development function is greatly affected, and the size of the genitals is as small as a child's. In addition, due to the frequent opening and closing of the essence gate, the sphincter muscles of the seminal vesicles are relaxed, resulting in sudden spermatorrhea and leakage of sperm, which can cause symptoms such as impotence and premature ejaculation. Not only do these young people suffer severe blows to their own health and great future, but also in the sexual life between husband and wife, they are often hated by their wives because they cannot fulfill their responsibilities! As a result, they feel guilty in their hearts, are restrained by their wives, and are ashamed and annoyed! The pain is difficult to describe in words!</p>
<p>Regarding the salvation method for this disease, firstly, patients must be pure-hearted and have few desires, avoid bad contact, exercise diligently, and quit bad habits. Before going to bed every night, rub the local area with cold water, pay attention to urination, and take four "Himitol's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the essence gate, and seminal emission can be stopped immediately that night. If there are various symptoms of weakness mentioned above due to frequent leakage, then you should also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin" at the same time. This agent extracts the gonadal hormones of lions, tigers, orangutans, sea dogs, etc., and blends them with precious mineral and plant substances, which are scientifically monitored and manufactured. Therefore, after taking it, it can produce essence, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and benefit the marrow in one day and night. If you continue to take it and persevere, even extremely weak bodies and extremely vicious seminal emission and spermatorrhea can be completely cured in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Healthy and beautiful breasts are a necessary condition for modern women</p>
<p>In front of a woman's chest, having a pair of towering breasts does help to improve a woman's health and beauty, ensure the successful birth of children, and facilitate the feeding of children. Therefore, advocating the development of breasts has unparalleled value. The wheel of the times is moving forward, and the development of women's breasts is an example of the progress of the times. We should unanimously agree and strive to assist them in their success! However, it is difficult to reverse deep-rooted habits. What we see in human nature are mostly women with small breasts and emaciated faces, showing a premature state of aging. Therefore, for women with a little new knowledge, how to make their breasts healthy and beautiful? It has indeed become a widespread and important issue. In our medical judgment, the special development of breasts is a characteristic of female physiology. The development of this physiological characteristic is based on the ovarian function of women. If the ovarian function is sound, then not only will the breasts naturally rise, but the buttocks will also develop, the tone will be gentle and beautiful, the temperament will be gentle and affectionate, and the metabolism will also be vigorous. In the skin, muscles, blood, etc., all parts are filled with new cells, so the skin is white and tender, the muscles are plump, and the blood is full and bright red. Peach blossoms appear on the face, and there is no need for powder, it is already very beautiful, it is difficult to increase age, and youth can be maintained for a long time. The life of husband and wife will be very sweet, giving birth to clever and healthy children, and organizing a happy and beautiful family. What a happy woman this is! However, women who have had chest binding in the past, or who have hidden diseases such as leukorrhea, lack of sensation, or irregular menstruation, must have had their ovarian function damaged, which leads to breast pain and facial decline, hopelessness of childbirth, and a weak love between husband and wife. Her fate must be extremely miserable! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation for women "Gonadin" to supplement ovarian function and invigorate metabolism. Then the breasts can be raised within a few days, and the above-mentioned hidden diseases can be eliminated. It is indeed the only good gynecological medicine for increasing health and beauty and eliminating diseases.</p>

<h3 id="e142">What is the Secret to Radically Curing Gonorrhea? <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the claims made by general city doctors on the study of Lin's disease seem to be only one kind. This kind of propaganda focuses on the therapeutic aspect. But to fundamentally solve gonorrhea, it is necessary to fulfill the following three conditions to tell the truth:</p>
<p>(1) The doctor's own knowledge and experience!</p>
<p>(2) The equipment should be thorough and should progress with the times!</p>
<p>(3) The patient should trust a reputable and responsible expert!</p>
<p>Being able to fulfill the above three conditions, then all gonorrhea, do not worry about no solution. The first condition, doctors, if they have rich medical knowledge, and even richer clinical experience, and have new brains, almost no cause of many years of clinical experience and self-satisfaction, otherwise, the more experience, the older the mind, unwilling to absorb new knowledge, and become a laggard in the times. Such doctors are not worthy of respect. The second condition is the equipment aspect. Now, because science is advancing, the equipment for the treatment of gonorrhea should naturally adopt the most advanced medical equipment. In this regard, I have inspected the new equipment of major hospitals in Europe and the United States every year, and have increased the purchase of the latest medical equipment. For example, microscopes, cystoscopes, and other medical equipment must be replaced every year to promote the effectiveness of diagnosis. The third condition, patients should trust and not change doctors who are willing to take responsibility and have a good reputation. Gonorrhea can definitely be cured by following what is said above. This is the secret to radically curing gonorrhea. All those who suffer from acute and chronic Lin, such as prostatitis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., in addition to using the latest medical equipment for fine examination and diagnosis, one must have German Filtrin intravenous electrotherapy, German Schick's serum, cold electrotherapy, various types of Jinqi, homemade vaccines, etc., which can be applied according to the symptoms. In as little as two weeks, up to five weeks, about ten out of ten can be cured.</p>

<h3 id="e143">The Banking Industry in Shanghai <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Investigator</p>
<p>Shanghai is the economic center of the entire nation, therefore its financial industry is more developed than elsewhere. Shanghai's banking industry is thus very prosperous.</p>
<p>Shanghai's banks include those run by foreigners and those run by Chinese. This article is limited to the latter, what is known as "domestic" banks.</p>
<p>The history of domestic banks in Shanghai is not as long as that of the money houses. To date, it's only been about forty-two or forty-three years. By the twenty-third year of Guangxu (1897 AD), many foreign banks had already been established in Shanghai, when Sheng Xuanhuai initiated and founded the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank. Therefore, the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank should be regarded as the pioneer of new-style financial institutions run by Chinese in Shanghai. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), the Shanghai branch of the Hubu Bank (the predecessor of the Daqing Bank), which was the predecessor of the Bank of China, was established, and Shanghai then saw the emergence of a national bank. Later, the Bank of Sichuan, the Xin Cheng Bank, the Xin Yi Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Siming Bank, and the Bank of Communications, which was established at the request of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, were successively established and branched out, and the domestic banking industry in Shanghai thus flourished. According to statistics, since the founding of the Republic of China, the total number of banks established or branched out in Shanghai has been no less than two hundred. Unfortunately, a large percentage of them inevitably went bankrupt or closed down due to unsound subjective conditions and difficult objective environments. But there are still more than a hundred existing.</p>
<p>The capital of each bank in Shanghai varies, with the largest being over five million and the smallest being fifty thousand. According to banking regulations, a quarter of the paid-up capital is sufficient to establish a bank, so in the past, several banks, after receiving ten or twenty thousand in capital, would make great fanfare and start business. Because of this, the banking industry in Shanghai once encountered a tragic fate. The reason was that some "smart friends" used the bank's signboard to absorb savings at high interest rates, and used the savings to engage in speculative ventures. As a result, they inevitably failed and declared bankruptcy and liquidation. At that time, the reputation of the banking industry was greatly affected; many small depositors even had their hard-earned money, earned through a lifetime of hard work, buried in their reckless behavior, and they regretted greed for high profits and committed suicide. Although those "smart" friends did not intend to commit fraud, the result of their risky behavior was that they succeeded for themselves, but failed "by grinding other people's scalps to make paste," which was ultimately contrary to the ethics of merchants.</p>
<p>Shanghai's banks include national banks, such as the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank. The Bank of China specializes in international remittances, while the Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank specialize in licensed businesses. There are commercial banks, and the business nature of commercial banks can be divided into: local, commercial, savings, agricultural and industrial, specialized, and other categories.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai's commercial banks mostly fell into a state of depression due to errors in their business policies: either due to operating real estate, or due to operating speculation—margin trading, yarn futures, government bonds, etc.—resulting in frozen funds and sluggish business. It was not until the implementation of the legal tender policy that they were able to get government support and escape from their predicament. However, we are not saying that Shanghai's banks have forgotten the work of helping the countryside and supporting industry and commerce. We know that many banks in Shanghai have also made considerable achievements in regulating the rural economy and providing loans for industrial and commercial cooperation.</p>
<p>Except for the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, which are located on the Bund, most of Shanghai's banks are concentrated in the Beijing Road area. The reason for this is, of course, to facilitate business. However, in order to facilitate customers and promote business, many banks have established two branch offices or offices in the city. Four or five years ago, the expansion of branch offices in the city showed a rapid development trend. We do not want to comment on whether this phenomenon is good or bad.</p>
<p>Shanghai's banks also have an industry association. Because its members are financial institutions, it occupies a very important position in Shanghai. It has not only made commendable achievements in its own mission of safeguarding the welfare of the industry, but also has a glorious record in supporting social undertakings; and it has provided a lot of labor in the process of the first phase of the War of Resistance against Japan and national construction, with labor that cannot be ignored. The industry association also has a joint reserve committee, whose mission is similar to that of the Shanghai Money Trade Reserve. It has played a very significant role.</p>
<p>Shanghai's bank employees have two professional organizations: the Banking Association and the Friendship Association. The former's members are senior bank employees, and the latter's members are general bank employees. The former aims to promote the study of banking by the domestic banking community and to cultivate practical talents for the banking industry, so it can also be regarded as one of the financial support organizations; the latter aims to connect feelings and deepen friendship; therefore, they are quite dedicated to the academic cultivation and social activities of the employees themselves.</p>
<p>The treatment of Shanghai's bank employees, although there are also differences in the level of treatment depending on the size of the bank, the profitability of the business, etc., is the best in general commerce. Unfortunately, the flames of the August 13th Incident have also bombarded their stable and preferential lives into a state of depression. Similarly, due to the proximity of the banks' addresses to the war zone and other reasons, in order to avoid unnecessary losses, after August 13th, they moved their locations to the exotic Xiafei Road, living a life of war. Since the withdrawal of the National Army to the west, some have moved back to their old homes, while others are still doing business at the new addresses.</p>
<p>Shanghai has fallen into an isolated island, and the business of each bank, of course, cannot be as free to develop as it was in the past, resulting in a very haggard state. However, the invading demons cannot burn and kill the life of Shanghai's banking industry. On the contrary, because the banking industry in Shanghai cannot expand here, it has rushed to the mainland. There is a vast land there for banking investment and cultivation, and the banking industry has cultivated new sprouts!</p>

<p>— By Zhang Hongfei</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Fate of Japanese Women <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— (Pegasus)</p>
<p>We all know that Japanese women are very affectionate, and they serve their husbands very thoughtfully. However, because the capitalist society of Japan still contains a strong feudal atmosphere, we can say that the affection of Japanese women is precisely their fatal tragedy.</p>
<p>American Hollywood film companies once captured the affection of Japanese women and shot a mournful film called "Madame Butterfly." Those who have seen that film feel a kind of yearning for Japanese women! This is not to say that they want such a woman to take care of them, but rather that if there really is such a woman's love in the world, and if men do not play with women like that American sailor, then what a sweet world it would be!</p>
<p>But this is ultimately an ideal. Precisely because Japanese women are excessively affectionate, Japanese women are even more tragic. Since the War of Resistance against Japan, whenever we see Japanese women writing letters to their husbands who are engaged in the war of aggression in China in the newspapers, we always feel how tragic Japanese women are, no matter how pseudo-patriotic we are.</p>
<p>During the "January 28th" Incident, Japanese women had organized "comfort groups." During this "August 13th" Incident, because of the strict news censorship within Japan, although we have not seen any news about Japanese women, we can imagine that more magnificent facts than the "comfort groups" must be performing a lot in Japan. Not long ago, in Shanghai, two Japanese soldiers committed suicide because their wives were working as prostitutes in Shanghai to "comfort" the soldiers fighting in China!</p>
<p>The fate of Japanese women is so tragic. But there are even more tragic things. For example, the "H" newspaper reported a dispatch from Tokyo, saying: "Recently, the government, due to the large number of deaths of soldiers in China, the number of widows left in the country is increasing, and the issue of pensions has become a major burden on the national economy. Now, in order to reduce this burden, it is planned to send 30,000 widows to Brazil for four months of colonial training, because there are 200,000 Japanese in Brazil, and many of them are unmarried, which can accommodate this group of widows. It is also heard that the Japanese Colonization Ministry is also planning to send a large number of widows to 'Manchukuo.' A request for an annual expenditure of 170,000 yuan was recently submitted at the budget meeting of the Diet to provide for the relocation of widows."</p>
<p>I copied the above news, not to reproach or oppose the widows, but only to feel that such relocation of widows only adds to the tragic fate of Japanese women, which anyone can imagine! Why? Because this kind of relocation contains the meaning of aggression!</p>
<p>Then how can the fate of Japanese women be improved? This is of course for Japanese women to consider themselves, but the day when China's final victory in the War of Resistance against Japan is won will also be the day when Japanese women leave that tragic "relocation" fate!</p>

<p>Chapter 4: Recalling the Past, Happy Heaven Spreads Wonderful Words; Forming New Friendships, Scenic Spots Make Pure Tours</p>
<p>Today, Wu Junsu really replaced Jin Danyu as a guide. Because the two Miss He were visiting Suzhou for the first time. Although Zhu Ai'ren was also a native of Suzhou, she had never paid attention to these things, so she didn't even know much about the famous scenic spots in Suzhou. Therefore, today she had to hold on to Wu Junsu for this reason. Wu Junsu pointed out to the two Miss He along the way: This is here, what scenic spots were left in the past, and when there are the most tourists. He also pointed out to them: This place has been abandoned and disrepaired, and has recently been repaired by the local government. The two Miss He had heard people say when they were abroad: Suzhou is the Venice of the East. Now their car was traveling along the river. They saw all kinds of boats in the river, full of yachts, scattered like stars. And the houses on the shore, the waterside pavilions, the cool pavilions, and the Xianglian study rooms, could all be included in the painting. First, He Shuangyu saw it and couldn't help but read happily: "Jiangnan is really beautiful, no wonder the literati and poets of all ages have sung its praises endlessly." He Liyu said: "People have always said that our Pearl River is gorgeous, but it is obviously a bit vulgar compared to here." Wu Junsu said: "In the past, people said, 'There is heaven above, and Suzhou and Hangzhou below.' Originally, Suzhou and Hangzhou were scenic areas. In fact, China is the most beautiful country, and there are good scenery everywhere, not just Suzhou and Hangzhou. It's not that we Chinese are selfish, but everyone from Europe and the United States who comes to China to travel says so. Because China is such a good place, people come to covet it. Those places that have been seized have been trampled on by them as much as possible. The most ridiculous thing is that during the war, we initially had many places that were occupied. When we recovered them, some large houses had all turned into small houses, with one room to the east and one room to the west, making it impossible to distinguish the direction. They also added many wooden houses, which in China are used by gatekeepers or police officers on duty." Everyone laughed when he said this. Wu Junsu also said: "There is one thing that I think the local authorities in Suzhou and Hangzhou have done reasonably well. That is, advertisements are not allowed to invade the scenic spots. In the past, those commercial advertisements were really tyrannical and terrible. They always chose the best scenic spots to erect an advertising board. And most of those advertising boards were for selling medicine, and they were all strangely shaped, ugly, and unbearable. It was really a scene-destroying thing. I hated it the most when I saw it. Now it's good, 'Advertising boards are not allowed to be erected randomly in scenic spots.'" It is precisely:</p>

<p>A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production, showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater</p>
<p>After Herbert Marshall and Dina Powell co-starred in "Little Women," he partnered with Claudette Colbert in "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife," which opened at the Cathay Theater during the Spring Festival. Although Herbert Marshall is not the most handsome male star in Hollywood, his appearance and acting skills are well-suited to the roles he plays. In "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring," he plays lawyer Steve, who, after divorcing his willful and selfish wife Christine, meets Maris in Washington. Because they are like-minded, they get married. However, Steve's fellow villagers see her as the culprit who destroyed Steve's family, often making Maris embarrassed. At the same time, Steve has a lovely daughter, Ellen, who is raised by Christine after the divorce. At a banquet, Christine and Maris have a falling out. Christine angrily wants to take Ellen away to New York. Steve, not wanting his daughter to leave, pleads with Christine to take Ellen to stay at a lakeside cottage. Christine thinks that with the relationship between her daughter, she can rekindle her old love with Steve. She pretends that Ellen is ill and urges Steve to go. But when Steve arrives, Ellen is not sick, and Christine is dancing. Steve suddenly realizes and enjoys family life with Maris.</p>
<p>The union of men and women is naturally built on the foundation of love. Since Steve and Christine have cracks in their relationship, it is natural for them to divorce. However, because of the nature of father and daughter, Steve's spirit is still threatened by pain, which is a very difficult problem to solve. As in "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring," it is too ideal for Christine and Maris to become close friends. Herbert Marshall plays Steve, who is torn between the love of husband and wife and the love of flesh and blood, very calmly.</p>
<p>Director Robert Sinclair is a stage director. "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring" is still his trial work. Here, although he has not turned "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring" into a stage play, he cannot describe the emotional changes between Steve, Christine, and Maris more deeply. Therefore, what "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring" makes us feel is just a very superficial story. This is his failure, and at the same time, it weakens the profound and touching power of "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring."</p>
<p>Virginia Bruce as Maris and Marilla Easters as Christine also cannot fully develop their acting skills because of the director's light-hearted style.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Prospects for the Future of Traditional Opera <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Yutang</p>
<p>Looking at the aftermath of the opening of the Great War of Resistance, both the front and the rear are using films and dramas as propaganda tools for the War of Resistance. Except for a very small number of abnormal areas, there are not many people who appreciate and sell traditional opera. It can be predicted that after the victory of the War of Resistance, during the period of reconstruction and construction, the decline of the status of traditional opera will be even more predictable. Don't think that just because the large and small Peking opera venues on the isolated island are full every day, traditional opera is full of vitality and still has a large audience. Let me tell you that this is just an abnormal development, a final burst of light when a patient is critically ill.</p>
<p>Many enthusiastic lovers of traditional opera, witnessing the rise and fall of traditional opera, can't help but feel worried. Therefore, they put forward the slogan of reforming traditional opera. The so-called Four Great Dan Actors, who have sung traditional opera for half their lives, are tired of it and blame the words of the traditional opera for being vulgar and incomprehensible. In this way, there are poets and writers, old remnants and young masters, who write scripts with sad and stubborn verses and ornate lyrics to label them as new operas. However, the consciousness of the scripts is not very advanced, and the performance techniques are not more advanced than traditional scripts. Just saying that the sword of Farewell My Concubine and the hoe of Burying Flowers have no artistic value at all, and are far inferior to the body movements such as Drunkenly Slaying the Tiger. And the lyrics written by famous writers are certainly beautiful and readable when written on paper, but when sung on stage, the audience is still confused. On the contrary, the words of the traditional opera can be understood by women and children. If this is considered reforming traditional opera, it is undoubtedly a failure. Li Shizeng and Jiao Juying, seeing that Fu Liancheng had made a fortune, and also disliked the way he was doing it, established a drama school. It is too early to teach ten-year-old children drama theory; teaching singing still requires asking old actors, so the talents created are not stronger than Fu Liancheng, and they can only quickly invite already famous Dan actors to teach Emei Sword and Spider Cave. This is not considered a reform either. Wang Bosheng worked hard for a while on "New Opera." He loved traditional opera and also knew a little about Western drama, so he wanted to extract some fertilizer from traditional opera to irrigate his imagined new opera, which would appear in a new form. He ran drama schools in Shandong for a long time, but there were no achievements to show us. However, when I think of this gentleman's performance of the 126-sentence Ascent to Heaven, I can foresee that his so-called new opera, in addition to tearing the face of traditional opera to pieces and selling a wild man's head, will never have a satisfactory harvest. Taking advantage of the curiosity of British and American people about China, Xiong Shiyi's Wang Baochuan, who wore Chinese costumes and spoke foreign languages, really made a splash (we have many similar scripts in your country). Then, when people got tired of Wang Baochuan, he changed to Cui Yingying. When foreigners got tired of it, Xiong Shiyi's pocket was also full. Traditional opera was also ridiculed enough by him, but he did not say that he was reforming traditional opera. (Two)</p>

<p>— Zhang Xiaocen</p>
<p>Before Lao Tan, Zhang Erkui was the best at singing Visiting Mother, and Yang Yuelou was also famous. In addition to Xu Yintang and Zong Kuisun's two schools of famous amateurs En Yuzhi (who was as famous as Hongdouguan's master Bao Dan Ting, etc.) and the Kui school, Yu Sansheng was also highly praised and stood alongside the Tan school. Wang Guifen and Sun Juxian, who also performed this play, were also rivals of the Tan school, but they were no match for Lao Tan. After Wang, Wang Fengxiang's singing voice had not declined before the eighth year of the Republic, and this play could also move people. After Lao Tan's death for several years, Yu Shuyan rose up, and Shuyan was not without merit in making the Tan tune immortal. From then on, there is no need to discuss it. The following describes the perfect roles in Lao Tan's era: Tan Xinpei (Fourth Brother), Wang Yaoqing (Princess), Chen Delin (Empress Dowager Xiao), Li Shunting (Sixth Brother), Shi Xiaofu (Fourth Madam), Xie Baoyun (She Taijun), Zhu Suyun (Zong Bao). After Lao Tan's death, the famous actors in the old capital who sang Visiting Mother were Wang Fengqing and Yu Shuyan, whose supporting roles were Chen Delin (Empress Dowager Xiao), Ji Yunfu (She Taijun), Mei Lanfang (Princess), Wang Qinong (Fourth Madam), Jiang Miaoxiang (Zong Bao), and Zhang Chunyan (Sixth Brother). As for the role of Empress Dowager Xiao, apart from Delin, Li Baoqin was also good, and Wu Caixia, Zhao Zhixiang, and Furongcao were still acceptable. As for the role of She Taijun, apart from Xie Baoyun and Long Yunfu, it can be said that there were no successors. Mei Lanfang exclusively dominated the role of Princess, and Yanqiu and Xiaoyun were overshadowed. Apart from Li Shunting, Jia Honglin was the best in the role of Sixth Brother. Wu Caixia and Zhao Zhixiang were also quite competent in the role of Fourth Madam. Among the female actors, Meng Xiaodong and Xue Yanqin can be called two difficulties.</p>
<p>In addition, Ma Lianliang became more and more popular in Shanghai, and his life was regretful that he could not sing Visiting Mother with Mei Lanfang. In a grand performance in Shanghai one year, Suliang came to Shanghai from Ping, determined to sing Visiting Mother. As a result, Lanfang still sang with Tan Fuying, and Lianliang had no choice. Tan Fuying's reputation in Shanghai has always been below that of Lianliang. However, in Zhang Xiaolin's performance, he sang Visiting Mother with Lianliang, and Fuying was greatly appreciated by the audience. From then on, Fuying's reputation greatly increased, and Lianliang did not dare to perform this play much after that. However, recently, Fuying could not use the ga tune when singing "Calling Xiao Fan" at the Golden Theater, which was also dissatisfied by the audience. To be fair, it is not a disgrace even if he cannot use the ga tune. Also, Qilin Tong in Shanghai has also sung Visiting Mother several times. It is not known whether he sang it alone or with Gao Baisui. It is also unknown whether Zhou Xinfang has another style for this play.</p>

<p>This magazine has published the process of Guan Zhongxin Yanqiu's arrest twice, which has attracted much attention from readers. Someone asked me whether the new actor is alive or dead? Then I dare to assert that she is not dead. According to the Reuters dispatch from Beijing on the 20th, the new actor "died of starvation in prison." When this news came out, everyone felt abrupt, so this magazine republished the details of her arrest on the 23rd, saying that she was injured and released on bail and had been admitted to the Xiehe Hospital for treatment. I think she won't die, and since she has been released on bail, she won't die in prison. This is obvious. As for the inhuman physical punishment suffered by the new actor after being arrested, I think it is completely unjust. Of course, there are also quite complicated reasons in it. After reading the short essay below, you can understand a little bit.</p>
<p>— (Attached by Ji Ping)</p>
<p>I have seen reports about the death of the famous actor Xin Yanqiu one after another, and the opinions are divided. Even this magazine has two different records. Recently, I received a letter from a friend living in Ping, who also mentioned this matter. The facts he described are slightly different. I will record it here for the time being. How the truth is, still needs to be proved by the facts.</p>
<p>According to the letter, "The puppet organizations in Beijing are now very popular in supporting actors. Miu Bin is the one who supports Xin Yanqiu. Every time the new actor takes the stage, almost all of his tickets are sold by Miu. Miu's wife is famous for being fierce, so she often wants to find ways to harm her. One day, Xin Yanqiu took the stage at the Jixiang Theater. Miu Bin booked a box in advance, but temporarily this box was suddenly occupied by a Guan (or Guan Zheng Lin in the Reuters report - the author notes). Miuni was able to escape death because of this. On that day, someone was planning to assassinate Bin. Although the box he booked had been changed, the slip of paper with the words 'Minister Miu' had not been torn off. The assassin did not realize it for a while and mistakenly regarded Guan as a thread, and with a bang, Guan became a scapegoat. Afterwards, Miu's wife secretly told the Japanese that Xin Yanqiu was secretly instructed by the Communist Party to make a trap in an attempt to kill Miu. As a result, the new actor was recognized and imprisoned. As of the time of sending the letter, there was no other development."</p>

<p>— Bu Zhi</p>
<p>Little Wang Huchen, aka Mu Lan Jun, is considered a very interesting character by everyone.</p>
<p>Last month, he accepted an invitation from a certain theater in Nanjing, intending to perform there. The terms were agreed upon, with a monthly salary of seven hundred yuan. So, he packed his bags, got a travel permit, and after a farewell dinner with many friends, he happily boarded a long-distance bus. Who knew that halfway there, the bus broke down for some reason, and he injured both legs. Greatly alarmed, he returned to Shanghai, thoroughly displeased. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he cited this incident as a reason to cancel the contract with the Nanjing theater.</p>
<p>Now, his leg injuries have healed, and he is celebrating the New Year as happily as anyone else. However, if anyone asks him about his dangerous experience, he will vividly imitate the situation for them. He describes how he prepared to leave; he describes the type of bus he rode; he describes how interesting it was sitting on the bus; he describes what he saw before the accident; he describes the panic during the accident; he describes the extent of the bus damage; he describes where he injured his legs; he describes how he decided to return to Shanghai; he describes how he was treated after arriving in Shanghai. He tells every detail, patiently, explaining everything meticulously. In the end, he concludes with a "dangerous, so dangerous," which is:</p>
<p>"From now on, I dare not leave the wharf again. Even if Nanjing offered me ten times the seven hundred, I wouldn't risk it. Life is precious. It's not worth making a mess of things. It's better to live peacefully in Shanghai and make a living!"</p>
<p>Followed by a burst of hearty laughter.</p>
<p>His attitude is quite amusing.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The ancients often said, "Wrath makes the hair stand on end." According to my humble opinion, since the predecessors had such a saying, there must be a reason for it. When I am extremely angry, although I can't actually make my high-topped turban fly off, I can at least manage to keep it firmly in place. This will earn me applause from the audience, firstly, it won't disappoint the experienced theatergoers, and secondly, it won't violate the industry regulations I mentioned above."</p>
<p>Everyone who heard Master Tan's lengthy explanation was very satisfied, thinking that he was in a good mood today, so some people eagerly asked him, "How do you practice this skill? Can you reveal it so that we can all learn it?" Old Tan just smiled, immediately interrupting them, saying, "I'm tired today, let's talk about it another day." Among these people, there were one or two who knew his habit of keeping secrets, so they stopped the others from asking. Generally, experts in any field are like this: they would rather take their skills to the grave than teach the secrets they have painstakingly researched to others; especially someone like Old Tan, who doesn't even pass them on to his sons-in-law, how could he be willing to tell outsiders? In the past, the old thirteenth Dan, Hou Junshan, when he sang "Drunken Concubine" and performed the "Lying Fish" posture, his headdress would never fall off. For others, as long as the head and body formed a straight line, the imperial concubine's phoenix crown would fall to the ground. Therefore, ordinary people performing this would often keep their bodies close to the ground while desperately lifting their heads to prevent the headdress from falling off too soon. Later, Old Hou's apprentice had a secret relationship with his teacher's wife, and she repeatedly begged her teacher to ask him to explain it clearly. Old Hou, pressed by his beloved concubine, finally told her, "He has already learned seven or eight tenths of my skills. In the past, because I still had to make a living in this field, I had to keep a few tricks up my sleeve and hide this unique skill. Now that I'm so old, I don't want to work in the theater anymore, so it doesn't matter if I reveal it."</p>
