<h3>寶安南頭登陸日軍　迭遭華團隊猛烈擊襲　日軍決擬隔離香港與內地之交通　港當局已積極布置各項戰時設備　美將分配若干軍艦增強遠東防務</h3>
<p>興寗　日軍在寳安南頭登陸後、迭遭華團隊猛烈襲擊、傷亡綦衆、損失浩大、連日運屍體一百五十餘具至深圳附近焚燒、傷兵則送回日艦、（二十日電）</p>
<p>翁源　進佔深圳之日軍、連日構築工事對九龍方面警戒、（二十日電）</p>
<p>香港　此間對於華南日軍發言人所稱、「英方繼續援助華方、故日方有封餓九龍外圍之必要、」認為嚴重、因此間大部之新鮮食物、多來自中國內地也、（二十日美聯社電）</p>
<p>香港　港各項戰時設備、當局無不積極佈置、又貨車司機、不論失業與吾、亦須一律登記、（二十日電）</p>
<p>香港　外訊、美總統正計劃重行支配太平洋艦隊、俾能於日對美廢約採報復手段時、增强美在遠東地位、更傳美將分配若干艦隻、駐在與中國接近之英法海軍根據地、另悉、美總統曾向蘇建議、如英法蘇成立協定時、美對蘇亦願採平行舉動、以增强遠東之民主勢力、並允予華以財政援助、（二十日專電）</p>
<p>香港　華南日軍宣稱、日軍已掌握香港領境綫、若英不中止援華行為、日將封鎖港周圍、（二十日專電）</p>
<p>東京　今日據此間軍部發言人宣稱、華南日軍感覺英國長此援助中國政府、則不得不隔離香港與內地之交通、該發言人對於因此為或將使香港公民感覺不便、表示歉意、惟謂英國援助中國政府一日不止、則日人此項舉動、殊難避免、該發言人又稱、日軍八月十七日所攻佔之英境邊界沙頭角地方、與中國內地之門江（譯音）及三水間、均有新築成之汽車公路、軍火及其他貨物、均由香港沿此路輸入中國內地、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　今日中央日報社論稱、自日軍佔領深圳後、香港所處之地位、已相似於目前之天津、英國最大之錯誤、卽為對於綏靖政策、具有神秘之信仰、殊不知日木之擴展政策、乃為其預定之計劃、設英國再圖與日本妥協、則新加坡亦將受日木之威脅矣、（二十日美聯社電）</p>
<h3>鄂南祗小接觸</h3>
<p>平江　鄂南方面連日祇有接觸、十七晨、華某部在白霓橋西北地區殲日兵五十餘、並在中伙鋪以手溜彈擊毀日卡車一輛、內載日兵二十餘、悉被炸斃、又白霓橋之日軍、向附近之高家嶺一帶行威力報復、反被華軍擊退、又十七日華軍在通山陽新間之大皈鎭殲日兵四十餘、獲步槍九支、子彈千發、十八日日兵百餘向華反攻在該鎭以東地區激戰半日、華又斃日五十餘人、（十九日電）</p>
<h3>華軍茍抱決心反攻　必能取得絕對優勢　外國軍事專家之意見　蔣委長忙於準備空軍機械化部隊　三百萬新軍訓練完成即下令總攻</h3>
<p>重慶　據華方觀察者之意見、日軍似不致續向中國內地取大規模之攻勢、日軍將以少數戍兵扼守各要點、一面緊對海岸之封鎖、一面建立所謂「聯邦政府、」從事傾覆中國之經濟與金融制度、日軍今後將常向重慶與軍事根據地以及工業中心點作空襲、以圖破壞自由的中國之生產努力、今日問題之焦點、為華軍是吾有充分之砲隊機械化隊伍飛機等戰具、以取反攻勢而獲勝利、今日祇須克復任何眞正重要之大城、或大敗日軍、卽足摧毀日軍之冒險工作、自漢口陷落後、華人各界卽紛紛猜測日軍將吾續向內地進攻、或在目前以獲得富饒之長江流域及華北華南各地而自滿、此後將以其精力用於經濟政治塲合、彼相信日軍將續向內地進攻者、以為今有三種可能性、（一）向西北進攻、以期截斷中國與蘇聯之陸地交通、（二）向西南進攻、志在截斷中國與越緬之鐵路公路交通、（三）直向西攻、以中國戰時之首都重慶為目的、已往十個月中之種種徵象、皆足證明日本決定不擴張在華之軍事活動、而圖用經濟政治方法以困自由的中國、對中國法幣之戰爭、設立所謂「聯邦政府」之企圖、注精衛之和平運動、大批日軍由長江流域撤退、皆足為上述意見之佐證者也、一般人相信日本政策之成功與吾、全視華軍能吾取强有力之總反攻為斷、日軍事當局則以為華軍不致有此能力、故現僅以少數戍兵扼守長江一帶之各城鎭、其兵力殊形單薄、據外國軍事專家之意見、華軍苟抱決心、從事反攻、則必能全將自漢口達南京長江南岸各城鎭收復、惟此種反攻、必輔以飛機大砲、始能奏功、中國軍事當局現不欲洩露其軍事計畫、據華人各界聲稱、事有顯然者、蔣軍委長迄未下令作任何大規模之反攻、蓋正保存其軍力與戰具、俾時機至時、作大決戰之用也、聞刻在訓練中者、共有新軍三百萬人、此外已執戈從戎者、尙有二十萬人左右、蔣委員長現正忙於訓練空軍砲隊機械化隊伍之戰士、俟此三百萬人訓練完成、空軍砲隊機械化隊伍均準備蔵事、則蔣軍委長必將下令取總反攻、至於華軍將在何地作此大攻擊、取道晋省以入華北乎、沿長江一帶之華中乎、抑在華南以撲廣州乎、今作此預料、尙嫌過早、（二十日路透社電）</p>

<h3>英國態度硬朗之前途</h3>
<p>但見英國載浮載沉於逆流之中，於是世人忽憂忽喜，情不自禁，世論或褒或貶，莫衷一是；夫英國果將如何自處處世，孰不願得而窮其究竟！</p>
<p>英國首相張伯倫氏憾於所為之為論者所不諒，嘗憤然語於其國會曰，吾人苦心孤詣，輒為不負責任者恣意非議云；慨乎言之，恚憤深矣。然鑒諸憂喜褒貶之瞬息改觀，可知世人對英國，對張伯倫氏，初非有何成見而必加之以惡聲；所為如彼，反應若此，實自召之也。不觀斷送捷克後之景象乎？豈張伯倫氏所稱之苦心孤詣所得求諒於人：及近頃為但澤自由市問題而一再聲明必踐對波担保之義務，昨更表示，凡不免於調解之嫌者，亦所必避云；舉世稱頌之詞遂不期而歸之。不觀天津四嫌疑犯問題乎？纔稱引渡，即為世論所不直，中英兩國輿情，允為譁然；顧於對日拒絕移交天津存銀，拒絕討論淪陷區之貨幣問題，則世論遽許之為態度硬朗。有裨大局。凡百因果；如響斯應；憂喜褒貶，豈偶然哉！天下自有耳目，公道自在人心，不可欺飾也若此：能不懍然，抑亦可以知所奮矣。</p>
<p>許英國之態度為硬朗而認為有裨大局者：但澤問題與天津存銀及貨幣問題而外，如最近在新加坡軍港方面之增加陸軍，如香港方面之調集軍艦，不許日方假道運輸給養，又如昨又盛傳準備宣告廢止英日商的以答復日方之排英運動，此皆硬朗之徵。而歐陸局勢愈趨緊張之際，世人方以為英國殆不免讓步於遠東，茲乃適得其反，此允稱頌英國之意外題材。抑不僅如是而已：如關於四嫌疑犯者，當其表示準備引渡，論者以為英國捐棄其傳統之公道，敝屣其立國之法治。但逢强暴，無事不可犧牲，亦含垢忍辱，無所不惜為；顧乃以民間之請求，倫敦方面即已許予援用「人身保護法令；」此其舉措，非關四嫌疑犯之女危禍福而已，亦且表示英國政府猶能顧全公道，尊重法治也，此在意義上之重要，遠逾於引渡與吾之問題。如關於天津存銀與淪陷區貨幣者，當其談判之始，絕不靦覲於成立所謂初步協定；此其形態，似乎但求苟安，無事不可承諾；及今乃能毅然拒絕無理要求，表示東京談判雖告停頓，甚或根本破裂在所不恤；此其舉措，非惟存銀與貨幣問題之足以告慰世人而已，即英國猶能保持其國家自由自主之政策，讓步妥協猶有所底止；此亦對英誅求壓迫者所久未發見之答案，而愛惜英國者所忻慰者也。</p>
<p>雖然，歐洲與遠東之一切問題，依然存在，未嘗以英國之能硬期而結束也。英國態度硬朗之意義與價値，未嘗以今日之階段而確定也。世論之稱頌英國者，亦就事論事，恰如其分，未可恃為一成不變者也。抑允必體認明白者，硬朗後之遭遇，或為壓迫之變本加厲，英國不將以不堪壓迫而重復屈膝乎？或為誘惑之甘言重利，英國不將動心於誘惑而深入陷阱乎？凡此疑問，非曰對英國之不信任；惟以為磕破此類疑問者，與其謂為繫於對英國之信任，母甯謂為繫於英國今後之決心。決心所在，不以表現硬朗之姿勢為既足，不以姿勢硬朗之奏效而自滿；蓋必不辭艱危，不圖僥倖，以硬朗之準備與行動，為態度硬朗之後盾。今日之國際，非宣傳之競爭，非姿勢之比賽，乃為利害與强弱之衡量。衡量之結果，我人深信英國有其必保之利，有其可恃之强；然與之對博者，方以一時之慘痛為之注，英國必須以相當之犧牲為之備。我人雖疑侵略者尙無對英開釁之勇，然就英國言之，實以此為決心之基礎，決心之瓷本。</p>
<p>英國當局或自以為夙具決心，然既往之種種跡象，殊不足為決心之明證。我人亦深願尊重英國當局之所宣示而置信於其夙具決心，然既往之種種跡象，至少使人誤認之為遊移。英國當局或以為誤認之責任不在英國；然事實上既以他國未能理解英國之決心。誤認英國為遊移，遂使英國國家之尊嚴，英國在國際之信譽，英國商民在遠東以及其他各處之物質權益，中國與其他若干國族對於英國之感情與友誼，凡此種種，俱受其相當鉅大之損害。此則英國當局所應於操持決心之餘，表示硬朗之際，虛心審察者也。若謂硬期誠僅姿勢，初非決心；則英國當局猶必別有決心焉：即壓迫英國者，初非英國退讓一步，退讓二三步所得而予以滿足，亦非英國意念中之何種妥協所得而予以滿足則英國而於表示硬朗之際，猶未能捐棄其妥協與退讓之意念者，惟有決心屈膝，偃旗息鼓而歸英倫三島而已。歐陸遠東，事屬一體，勢無二致者也。</p>

<h3>美日商約之廢止　危及日本對外貿易整個機構</h3>
<p>本期密勒氏評論報載阿煦勒John　Ahlers所著一文、論美國廢止美日商的對日所將發生之影響、　譯如下、</p>
<p>日人因美政府通知廢止美日商的所受之重大震驚、表面上似稍已平復、日當局似曾令各報對大局佯抱頗樂觀之見解、並鼓勵日本民衆相信美國之手段、對日本及其在華冒險作戰、無過份嚴重之影響、日本民衆雖經撫慰、而具虛偽的安全之感、然廣大的日本商界、則仍充滿憂懼也、</p>
<p>廢的之消息旣佈、橫濱與神戶之生絲價、頓時暴跌、期貨絲之交易、殊感困難、日本對美所有輸出、生絲的佔三分之一、而日本運往海外之生絲、幾什八售予美國、日本之陶磁器製造商、亦因以大為擾攘、因美國亦係彼等輸出品之最重耍市塲也、大阪棉業、預料對美國與菲島之棉織物輸出、將有危險、更有其他日本商界對此事亦表示大為關切、棉花或能自英屬印度及巴西購得未提煉的煤油、可由荷屬東印度、及墨西哥等處供給、但日本工業所用許多機器、全賴美國特有之機器油、而使動作靈活、此非購諸美國不可、日本大部份戰事工業之擴展、亦多賴美國不斷供給金屬機械、日木所亟需之某種高速度鋼、僅美國能製之、且日木所需之廢鐵及鋼、亦以美國為最重要之來源、</p>
<p>今條的仍有效力、須至距今五閱月餘之一九四〇年一月二十六日始吿滿期、但日本殊難以預作巨量遠期額外交易、以避免條的滿期後所受種種影響、生絲之供給、目前巳被嚴加限制、日本國內所存生絲、其數旣不足一個月之對美輸出、故不能在紐的貯積大量生絲、其他方面、外匯之短缺、使日本不得購貯大批額外之美國機器油、金屬機器及廢鐵等貨、縱或日本試作規模不大之購貯、恐亦將因美國商務部方面之决心反對而難以成事、</p>
<p>日本對美商業關係之重要、一覽日本貿易統計即能知者、本年最先五閱月中、日本輸出價値日金十一萬五千八百萬元之貨物、其中運美者佔一萬六千六百萬兀、但日木全部輸出中、幾有半數運往日元集團國、而不能產生外匯、輸往其他諸國者、僅値五萬九千七百萬元、美國佔此數百分之二七·七。若包抱日木對菲島與夏威夷之輸出計之、則美國在日本輸出中所佔之成數、增至百分之三十、更顯著者、為美國在日本輸入貿易中所處之地位、本年最先五閱月中、日本輸入價値日金十二萬一千三百六十萬兀、其中二萬八千七百六十萬元、來自其他日元集團國家、自日元集團以外諸國輸入者、計九萬二千六百寓元、其中四萬二千五百二十寓元來自美國、計佔日本自非日元集國輸入之百分之四十六、速同菲島與夏威夷、則達百分之四十八、日本輸入之一切軍需、三分之二來自美國、且其中若干項、日本全仗美國之好意始得輸入、</p>
<p>目前之美日商的滿期後、此種貿易、似將有何變化耶、日本殊難誘引美政府及時與之締結另一條的、邇來日方調查此種可能之嚴重性、其結果殊足令日人沮喪、故東京甚至或將不作另訂條的之提議、因此、自來年一月二十六日起、美日兩國間或成無條約之局勢、兩國有任意對待對方貿易之完全自由、日貨在美將失去目前條約中最惠國條款之利益、而不得不納最高入口稅、美國鑒於日政府現津貼出口貨之生產、（例如絲）或出口貨本身、（例如陶磁器）或將使日本除納最高入口稅外、另納特別懲罰稅、日本以低値勞工與美國之高値勞工、作自殺之競爭、乃懲罰入美日貨之另一動機、據可靠估計、美國工人所損失之工資、十倍於美國所輸入日貨之價値、因此等貨物、若不輸入、則須在美國製造故也、</p>
<p>日本對美輸出中佔大部份之生絲、允屬岌岌可危、今日美國製造絲襪、仍多賴日本生絲、但條的滿期時、杜旁特尼摩斯公司之兩新廠、於來年初可落成者、將開始大規模製造新的美國織襪絲代用品、其名曰「尼龍」（Nylon）日絲保持自身以抗尼龍之望、巳因廢約而大减矣、日本當然可作某種程度之報復、而將其非絕對必需之美貨、悉予禁止入口、但此等貨物、為數甚少、而在美國對日輸出中、所佔頗微、因日本目前之貿易與取締外滙制、巳將此等美國輸出品减至最少額矣、日本如對美國棉花煤油·機械·與廢鐵等物、微收懲罰稅、則日本自身須付出此種附加之稅、</p>
<p>日人對廢的恐懼最甚者、為美國或將不復準備以原料煤油。金屬機器。飛機。與其他各種軍需售予彼等、美政府對此種行動、顯已胸有成竹、決非僅藉修正美國中立法或通過參議員畢德門所提對破壞九國公的諸國禁運軍火之提議、始能對日停止某種物品之輸出、羅斯福總統及其政府、另有種種方法達此目的、此種政策、甚且未經國會之正式批准、邇來經美國務院之堅決主張、而取締美國飛機輸日、即顯示其能作何種行動也、</p>
<p>若問美京何以尙未採取此等辦法、則須明瞭美日商的乃此種手續的幾屬不能克服之障碍、該的第五條明白規定、兩訂約國任何方之任何商品、非對他國禁止輸出、則不得禁止輸往另一訂的國、此一障碍、將因條件滿期而消除、其後、日本所處地位、將不復能以相互義務之力量、而抗議美國之禁止出口矣、</p>
<p>日本係專賴海外商業之國家、美日商的之廢止、使日本遭遇其近代所經歷的最困難之對外貿易問題、日本對產生外匯國家的商業在危險中者、不下三分之一、而日本目前最重要之外國軍需供給地、或將因廢的而被截斷、再、日本更有對英未獲諒解、而英政府或將步華盛頓後塵之危險、日本對非日元集團各外國之貿易中、英國亦佔四分之一、故日本此種貿易、與盎格洛薩克遜兩國成交者、幾佔什六、德意兩國所處地位、無一能在日本商業中代盎格洛薩克遜兩國至値得注意之程度、滿洲與日軍在中國本部所佔各區、將吾受美日商的廢止之直接影響、留待異日覘之、美國與「滿洲國」並無商的、美國迄未承認長春傀儡政權、但中美間訂有商的、而在日人控制區內、此的遭受日方之大規模干涉者、歷時久矣、美國或將不復容忍此種干涉、亦屬可能、例如華北產物、現受日方半官性橫濱正金銀行之外匯統制、美當局不難對華北產物、拒發出口證、日人若被截斷而不能自由獲得美國之某種戰具及其他供給品、當然將經種租側徑、竭盡方法以求獲得之、彼等必將試圖在中國境內、其新勢力範圍中、輸入此等美貨、允其為取道上海而間接購其不復能向美國直接採購之物、本埠美當局將不得不審愼注視本埠市塲、俾防杜此種濫用美國在滬堅强的貿易地位、上海之為日人至大之援助、雖已歷有年所、然本巿固不應成為以詭計暗傷美國貿易政策之意向的活動根據地也、</p>

<h3>工部局向日方交涉　米糧自由運滬　商號函證制止囤積　米市復業限制嚴格</h3>
<p>上海豆米巿塲前因暗盤叢生、交易混亂、議決自十八日起、暫行停市後、准今日起復業、惟為整頓市塲營業計、復業後市塲營業、均須登記貨主及承銷受號、俾運銷符合、便於呈報、自滬巿食米問題嚴重後、工部局對自由運米到滬、現正在與日當局交涉中、並勸吿各米商平售存米、茲誌昨情如下、</p>
<p>函請公佈存米調查</p>
<p>豆米行業公會致公共租界工部局法租界公董局函云、「敬啟者、查存米調查」事、始於米業團體評價委員會、迨該委員解散後、由敝會繼續辦理、所有各期調查表、迭經函送貴局察核備查在案、乃邇來外界流言、謂此項米業自行調查之存數、未必可靠、藉以作為宣傳、搖惑人心云云、按此項調查之範圍、原係根據各堆棧之報吿、幷限於租界以內之各堆棧、至租界以外、以及米店所儲備、住戶所購置、本不在內、調查之目的、在察知民食盈虛、以便貢獻當局、預籌調節之策、此為貴局所諗知者、至敝會所調查者是吾準確、則聞貴局原亦派員調查今請將調查結果、予以公佈、俾知其數量相符與吾、以明實在、嗣後敝會對於是項工作、固當繼續為之、但除送請貴局察核、或逕由貴局公佈外、敝會不再公開發表、藉以避嫌、併此聲明、幸垂察焉」、</p>
<p>函納稅會制止囤積</p>
<p>兒童書局、裕生祥織造廠。永華印刷局。良華印刷局。等昨函公共租界納稅華人會云、「逕啟者、查本市米價昂騰、漫無止境、主要原因、半由於出產地之統制、半由於資本家之操縱（中略）、貴會為市民之表率、米價升降、動關全體巿民安危、應請代表全體市民致函公共租界工部局、請求會同法租界公董局、即日組設全市存米登記處、限令各米商及其他躉積之戶、律於三日內將所有存米實在數量、前來登記、其登記之米、由登記處編列號碼、以最後登記者為第一號、順次勒令提交臨時指定之公賣處所限價出售、至售罄為度、一面准全市各里弄推舉代表、組設存米檢舉委員會、在登記期滿之日、各就本里弄及其鄰近商店挨戶搜查、勿使漏網、如查有存米未經登記滿十石以上者、或按照該戶實在登記之數量超過十石以上者、均作為隱匿不報論、是項存米、應即悉數沒收、以其半數充賞、半數减價平　、所得之款、概行撥充救濟難民之需、似此辦理、一舉兩得、相應備函奉達、即希貴會查照、俯予實施、不勝感荷、再此後食米來源、亦煩函請工部局設法疏通、合併函懇」、</p>
<p>蕢延芳氏平耀意見</p>
<p>上海難民救濟分會主席蕢延芳、昨對往訪者發表辦理滬巿平糶意見云、際此外滙暴縮、界內居民已不堪其苦、而米價飛漲、關係民生允鉅、洽老主張平糶一法、實屬急務、惟據報載僅有八千包辦理平糶、共數似嫌過少、蓋米巿恐慌已久、居民需要正殷、一且驟有接濟、爭先恐後、人心所同、分配倘不得當、勢必影響治安、經辦者應有詳盡之計劃、以防不測、如以經濟關係、難期普及、則中外銀行界、不乏急公好義之士、可盡量聯合、共同籌劃、平糶德數、非有二三十萬包不能盡其功、至於洽老所提工部局上年訂購免稅洋米、所得免稅餘額三十餘萬元、移作虧耗之用、本人極端贊同、想工部局負有維持地方專責、當不致吝而不予、</p>
<p>昌平路上搶米風潮</p>
<p>本巿食糧、因被居奇囤積操縱之下、遂使猛抬狂漲、民不聊生、昨晚八時許、滬西昌平路第八十一號倪義興米號門首、突來衣不蔽體、形容憔悴之男女繼五百人各持微少法幣、希向該號糴取少許食米、以維生命、當時該號即以無米作答、於是引起羣衆憤慨、認為有意作難、人多口雜、遂釀成搶米風潮、但該號確屬無米應市、故僅被搶去麵粉約百包、比待探捕趕到、節四散　拘獲三男一女、以待偵查</p>
<h3>郵員要求加薪　局方准予津贴</h3>
<p>自黑巿塲外匯暴縮、百物隨之騰漲、生活程度之高、歷所罕有、上海郵政管理局郵務員工因生活維艱、聯名呈請郵務工會要求轉請局長乍配林氏、准予加薪數成、茲經乍氏再三考慮、巳允自乙等郵務員起至信差止、於八月份起、每人每月一律津貼七元五角、惟該局所用門警三十餘名、繼續耍求同樣辦理、以維生計、</p>
<h3>車業公會擬議　每車每日加租二分</h3>
<p>公共租界尙須核准自外滙暴縮後、外質及外國原料製成之貨品、售價均一致飛漲、人力車用之橡皮五金村料、亦漲起一倍以上、人力車同業公會特召開會議、商討增加車租辦法、結果僉謂戰前小照會（即行駛南市及法租界者）租價每日五角五分、後因南市封閉、故改為四角、惟當時之車料、僅及目下十分之四五方今生活程度日高、車夫車主之担負亦因之提高、故決議將車價加以調整、自二十日起、一律每日四角二分、藉以兼顧勞資雙方之利益、關於公共租界之人力車、則因工部局限制增租、故要求特區人力車公會向工部局交涉復議、准予酌加車租、藉以維持、</p>

<h3>日軍施橫暴虐政　內地民不聊生　於經濟盡其榨取之能事　對農民則任意恐嚇屠殺　少壯青年均被迫受軍訓</h3>
<p>字林報云、來自內地城鎭而今居上海之中國商人、有調查其故鄕局勢者、獲得關於日軍在內地城鎭鞏固其地位之消息、此輩商人、現在滬坐食些微積蓄、故切欲返內地重行經商、彼等先研究販米之可能性、而發覺可以五至七元向農民購米百斤、而在滬以二十元出售、除運費外、猶可獲利二三倍、並販布疋等物入內地、獲利又倍之、然據某商人云、渠在內地某小城與上海間販賣數决、獲利頗豐、</p>
<p>日軍操縱米糧販運</p>
<p>某日竟遭偽警橫加逮捕、投諸獄中、備受苦楚、財產被沒收、不得不棄業避往不受人注目之某大城中、旣有此先例、其他從事相類營業之小本商人、決計停止販賣、米糧賣買、遂獨歸日軍控制下一團體操縱、故日軍所獲甚巨、因彼等對運往上海及其他消耗中心地之米糧、任意索取、始准通行也、</p>
<p>華游擊陰加以限制</p>
<p>此種巧妙之榨取方法、為產米區鄕野中之華方游擊隊所悉、下令不准售米予日軍派出之人、游擊隊在若干道路上、不准每人每决運米逾四十斤、而僅足購米者己家之所需、此種辦法、使落入日人手中之米糧及其他產物、為數激减、開來京滬與沿鐵路一帶其他區域之游擊隊、其數旣在迅速增加中、日軍在侵佔區內之經濟程序、今乃殆危矣、</p>
<p>華日軍隊互相肅清</p>
<p>又據某君談其故里某城情况云、日軍巳在該城成立偽政府、並利用該城、作為根據地、今已開始「肅淸」該區游擊隊之運動、他方游擊隊亦開始肅淸日駐軍運動、而壓迫日駐軍悉數退入鐵路一帶較大城市中、故目前之結果、似斷然有利於游擊隊、此大半因游擊隊人數衆多之故、</p>
<p>濫捕鄉人非弄拷打</p>
<p>然游擊隊不能阻止日軍屢撥一至三百名携機關槍與小山砲、以及三叫日之糧食、出擊游擊隊作為根據地之市鎭、日軍到達時、游擊隊已在稍遠處、覓有利機會作夜襲、或殲滅哨兵及小隊日兵、日軍旋捕平民數人、押回司令部、大施拷打、迫其吐露關於在鄰近活躍的游擊隊之情報、</p>
<p>人間地獄恐怖世界</p>
<p>游擊隊與日兵皆常衣便服、尤以從事偵察時為然、鄕民遭人出槍相向時常不知對方為何人、致有誤言、而遭擊斃或受苦楚者、此乃日軍携入整個侵佔區之混亂與恐怖也、日人在侵佔區遍發之招貼、稱此為「東亞新秩序」、「東亞和平」、和平辛勤的中國農民、過此生活、不啻人間地獄、彼等受此苦楚、猶不敢向外界訴述、</p>
<p>少壯青年附游擊隊</p>
<p>邇來日軍在侵佔區內數度强徵華人、施以大規模之訓練、某區中日軍强令十八至二十五歲男子、悉受軍訓、此輩靑年、不願與同胞作戰、相率避入游擊區、報効游擊隊者頗為踴躍、某部隊突增志願兵三千名之多、</p>
<p>變更策略欲戰蘇聯</p>
<p>日軍為綏和靑年之恐懼，並遭傀儡之强烈反對、乃更變其策略、宣佈靑年不必與同胞作戰、而將開往東三省戰蘇聯人、因靑年幾已悉數逃避、日軍擬强徵較年長而未逃避之廿五至卅歲男子、日軍尙未準備張其陷阱、使此等男子入其羅網、巳露風聲、此等男子遂亦逃避、</p>
<p>中年男子被迫受訓</p>
<p>但不及避走者盈干累萬、今在南京及其他地點受訓、日軍所抱政策、為儘可能將靑年人遠離故鄕、使不易逃逸、若圖逸走、則方言不同、不難查出、因東三省邊界受蘇聯威脅、故日軍刻正大舉進行訓練華人對蘇作戰之企圖、日軍原擬於綏　一全中國時、始訓練此輩靑年</p>
<p>東二省人迫來上海</p>
<p>然因蘇聯無袖手以觀之意、日軍乃在華中內地、加速强微靑年、而其實行反共運動、乃圖征服中國、復利用中國征服蘇聯等地、移居東三省之魯省人、已被日軍迫來上海內地、對抗游擊隊者頗多、日軍今在華中强迫靑年受訓、豈能使之迅速成軍、而利用以侵佔史廣大的區域、並將白人逐出亞洲乎、</p>
<h3>黃砂被統制　建築停頓　數千工人亟待救濟</h3>
<p>上海建築所需各種黃砂、素由上海市砂石業同業公會同業會員派員向泗礁採購、再由各帮販運客商運滬應銷、估價出售、惟自滬戰爆發後、上海環境特殊、四郊土產咸遭統制、泗礁黃砂無法運抵、會由該業公會呈請租界當局設法疏通來源、截止目前、來源仍稀、茲滬巿整個建築事業、遭受影響、顯吿停頓、無法進行、所有砂石行號、亦皆暫停營業惟望租界當局急行設法、俾維正當商業、得克繼續進行、昨據該業負責者云、該業各行號會員、資本素極稀薄、規模頗小、况經營砂石獲利頗鮮、茲營業停頓、數千工人遭受失業、加以生活程度高昂、若長此以往、恐無立錐餘地、情迫勢緊、無容稍緩、深盼當局竭力設法予以救濟、</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>關於體美上的一切，當然，容貌美是要有的，但還須顧及全體。現在我們耍推崇「康健美」。那種「風流倜儻」「吟花咏月」的「白而面書生」，已失了時代性，所以體美的條件是：「姿勢正確」，「筋肉發達」；總說，就是體格要「强勁堅實」！不康健的身體，精神就不充足，婚後家庭問的樂趣，也就不濃厚，並且對於將來子女，也有關係，所以對於對方須連注意的是：運動，衛生，娛樂等的習慣。</p>
<p>同時吾人不能吾認，婚姻的基礎是戀愛，而戀愛的動力是「美」，所以也可以說擇耦的第一條件是「美」。但一提到美，很容易使人想到外貌上去，而且一般女性，確也常以「容貌」美來作配耦的標準，這實是錯誤了。美應注重在生殖本能上的，纔能幸福無窮。</p>
<p>講到生殖本能上的美，這也亦體美有連帶的關係，因為體態健美之後，其身體必健康而無病，是故生殖機能充沛而壯健，在愛情上講，此種男性恒為女性所愛，在生育上講，此種男性所產之子嗣，定必優秀而强壯，至於其自身亦必感覺幸福無窮，精神飽滿，面色紅潤，智力豐富，不若削瘦者之患有神經衰弱，早洩，遺精，陰痿不育等生殖力渙散毛病。蓋男女之結合，旣屬生殖，則此種毛病，允應加以速治的必要。</p>
<p>關於生殖美與健康美的養成，首宜在發育時避免自凟，婚前力避荒淫，婚後力戒縱慾，如先天不足，或因意志薄弱而犯此者，其治療時應服以德國眞正舉丸精質製劑男用「補體康」此在臨床上確著治療之價値，為吾輩醫師所信賴，故敢負責介紹於病家，凡發育不全，神經衰弱，腎虧早洩最為對症。其女用「補體康」有發育乳峯，調經種子之功，在體美上實有其無比之功效。</p>

<h3>吸食雅片有如借印子錢！</h3>
<p>— （美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師撰）</p>
<p>我人之精力，原是有限的，不能過分應用，若是精力過分應用了，反而以後的精力，不能如往常那樣寬裕。我們常見許多人因為日間過分疲勞，覺到精力不繼，往往想用興奮一時之藥品，以資補救，最常見者為雅片；，此種吸食雅片煙的人，不一定為什麼胃痛，心痛及什麼痛而拿來吸食，遂至成癮，却是多由身體疲勞，欲借雅片以興奮之。允其是縱惰聲色者，因為精力吿乏，不得不借雅片的興奮性，以預支明日的精力，而圖眼前的快樂。這無異借了人家的印子錢，改日都耍連本帶利還給債主的，所以吸雅片的人，愈吸精力愈感不濟，而愈要吸煙，結果必致弄得筋疲力盡而後已，此猶舉債者，債臺高築，終有一天破產完結同一理由。所以以吸雅片者，直是向紅頭阿三借印子錢相同。</p>
<p>要「戒除雅片」原非易事，惟有用有力之奧援，而「補體康」一藥，乃挽救一切精力衰竭之最偉大之補劑。</p>
<p>原來吸雅片者不能增何種精力，只是振奮一時間的精力，而「袖體康」一則完全是採用雄壯動物之靑春腺製成，服後能促細胞之發達，並促其新陳代謝之機能加速。凡是因雅片而使各細胞失去彈力，萎靡不振，血液减少，肌肉瘦削，精力短少，或因過度房事而致遺精，早洩，腎虧委弱，服「補體康」均有特殊的功效。並可使吸食雅片者服用「補體康」之後，自動戒絕，良以「補體康中叉有一種蛋黃素，於戒煙方面，大裨益也。</p>
<h3>治肺之要着</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺臟為一無知覺之臟器，故其為癆菌侵入，毫不知覺，雖侵蝕成為空洞，亦無特異痛苦，惟癆菌犯及肋膜發生肋膜炎，則有胸部刺痛之感，或則因肋膜炎而至胸腔蓄水，，或則因結核腦膜炎而至斃命，故治療肺病，一方應注意攝養，如空氣之流通，日光之充足，對於飮食，尤應攝取富有滋養而易以消化之食品。並應忌食煙一酒等刺激品，而其主要方面，一允應昭以肺病特效藥，「補肺一拿爾」，以增生肺部石灰質，一殺滅癆菌，由是則肺病無論至何期，亦得根本全治，因此，「補肺拿爾」得能風行各國，實非偶然之事也</p>
<h3>自凟行為對於腦力的損傷</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>關於自凟行為，醫學家費了無次數的調查與硏究，遂證明此種行為易流為放縱，萬一犯上後，大有不易戒除之概。</p>
<p>然則，這樣的行為，對於身體何種部份最易呈害的作用呢？英國著名性慾專家Henry　Haevelock　Ellis靄立思博士，指出腦髓最為先遭殃的部份，其次是性機能，最後為脊髓神經，因為手淫之動機，是由於腦髓中幻想色淫而起，必須耗費大量的空想力，方然再用種種方法以達到自凟的目的，所以患自凟的人必先息失眠症，此後記憶力消失，頭痛，頭重等病態一一發現，故一個中學生，因息上過度的自凟而使學業成績减退者，比比皆是。</p>
<p>為治療本症起見，不能不首先禁止自凟的惡癖，務宜早睡早起，淸心寡慾，然後服以補腦，補腎，補血之睪丸精貿製劑男用「補體康」，則不論因手淫而引起的腦力斵傷，及性慾消失，生殖不能，均可澈底根治，不過倘有遺精現象，則應同時兼服「耐而斯遺精片」三片。</p>
<p>淋病座譚</p>
<h3>淋絲之真相與療法</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路　九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋系之眞相，其造成之形態不同，大概此種淋系，在急性時間，不甚為病家所注意，因急性淋時，其尿道內之膿液紛流，固不必辨其淋系之眞相也。惟自淋病渡過急性而成慢性之後，此種最令病人刺目一而討厭之淋系，長此纏綿不絕矣。實際上，凡是淋病患者，其內部有淋菌踪跡之處，都有炎症發生，而此炎症，又往往為淋系製造的必須之條件。故患淋病而有淋系未淸者，卽為淋病未愈之證。但亦有淋毒已淸，而上皮細胞剝落，或因有其他之膿球菌作崇者。則亦不可一概而論，總之，此種症象，必須有經騐而並有設備完全之聲家治之，始可獲到眞相而治愈也。</p>
<p>淋系之形狀，亦至不一致，有形如點狀者，有形如撇狀者，大多在慢性淋患者於淸晨時封口，及現於尿中，大概慢性淋各症狀中皆有之，而後尿道淋之殘留的炎症，允多見之，他如攝護腺炎，膀胱炎等，皆有此症也。故要掃除此種淋系，必須用面面皆顧到的療法，故內服藥中，不得不推「克淋儂」一藥為巨擘。而理學療法，德國靜電療法，允為各種電療之魁首。一方更以濟以手術，於是難於掃蕩之淋系，遂可在三五星期中根本治愈矣。余自臨床二十餘年以來，屢試不爽，</p>
<p>診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號，每號金五角，並贈價値一元之「性病全書」二册。</p>

<h3>穿皮鞋者注意</h3>
<p>— 振清</p>
<p>現在穿皮鞋者日見增多，好似不穿一雙皮鞋，顯不出一種上海人的樣子，於是皮鞋店如雨後春勢般的設立着了。可是買一雙皮鞋的代價至少在十元左右，往往有許多人買了不久，鞋面尙佳，而厚厚的鞋底已壞。須知每雙皮鞋，其底上有梅花式的釘子兩個，它的根很深，可以一直深入底內，假使一不小心，大雨後穿着，水必透入，三次以後，鞋底已被爛斷，而修補也不易，在雨天已成廢物，棄之豈不可惜？倘使在購買皮鞋時，就用生明礬澆之，把兩釘的眼塞住，那就耐穿而經久得多了。在下雨的時候，皮鞋油更宜多塗，擦得光亮，因為皮質是不易入水的呀！</p>
<h3>巴黎最新流行的方型鑲嵌術</h3>
<p>— 吳公</p>
<p>鑽石是現代婦女最高貴的裝飾品，它有着閃爍的光芒，特別是在燁燁的燈下，明耀得人們眼花撩亂，彷彿鑚石上生着魔光一樣。近代的巧匠，就在鑽石的鑲嵌術上，下着一番精細的工夫，來誘惑都市高貴婦女的炫奇心。</p>
<p>過去的鑲工採取的是獨粒鑽制，戒指耳環或是腕鐲，都以獨立的大鑽為主體，周圍輔以小粒鑽，鑲成圓環的形式。自從立體與流綫型流行後，鑽石的巧匠，立刻動用腦筋，應用到鑽石的鑲嵌術上，一九三八年的下半年剛露萌芽，到了今年，方型鑲嵌術就覇佔了整個首飾界，允其是巴黎的式樣，更矜式天下，風行了全球。上面的圖樣，就是方型鑲嵌術的一種，它以兩粒大鑽為主體，中間橫貫着一排小型方鑽，兩旁又點綴着小粒圓鑽，合成長方的錢條，這是一九三九年巴黎最流行的戒指。女子腕鐲，也以長方形的白金做底版，用方的圓的小粒鑽，排比成流綫型，再把幾粒大鑽襯托其間，更加顯出强烈的光亮，腕鍊是用珍珠串成三條，豪貴富麗，十足的表現出來。</p>
<p>上海第一家介紹這方型鑲嵌的是邁爾西愛路的倍來亨首飾店。這家店主，有個哥哥在巴黎，每個月有新式樣，他馬上寄來，有好多圖型，上海沒有見過。同時從巴黎購來許多鑲嵌的儀器，據說是設備最完美的一家。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>說起瓜類做的菜，上星期介紹了一樣冬瓜盅，讀者們大的已嘗試過了吧。冬瓜本身原沒有甚麼特殊的滋味，可以「淸淡」二字作為它的定評。把它做湯菜，最為相宜，只要有鮮湯，隨時可以利用它的。我家因入秋以後，天氣酷熱，做菜仍注重一個「淸」字，前天便做了一味冬瓜肺頭湯。猪肺這樣東西，據說是可以補肺的，所以凡患咳嗽的人，對它頗有好感。洗的時候，必須多加工夫，細細將血筋剔除，洗得乾乾凈凈，然後買些火腿骨頭合在一起，冬瓜切了方槐，附帶邊尖香菌等一同放在鍋子裏慢慢的炻，以炻酥為止，吃起來湯淸味鮮，猪肺也酥嫩可口，還有一個猪心，往往是跟着肺一起來的，炻酥後其味允在肺頭之上。來吧！大家何妨試一試。</p>

<h3>搭擱樓</h3>
<p>— 湘綺</p>
<p>搭擱樓，是一種無可奈何的辦法；醫如東西多了，沒有地方擺，塞在角落裏，亦巳經塞無可塞，於是蓋搭擱樓，以備收儲雜物。又有一種，因為家裏的人口多，亦祇好增搭擱樓，以免擁擠。最難堪的，是專以擱樓生財的二房東，二房東多數以餘屋轉租以圖利，雖然錢財是人人眼熱，不過亦須有相當尺寸，耶所謂「君子愛財取之以道」。譬如這個二房東，巳經搭過了擱樓，亦巳經因擱樓而賺過了錢，自然再不應該在這種年頭，好像趁火打刦一樣，擴展擱樓的面積，或者重新增加三層擱樓，只顧自己進財，不顧他人氣悶不氣悶，危險不危險。要知道新增了擱樓，為了賺錢起見，必須新進了一份人家，多了一份人家，勢必增加許多人口，同之具有極大危險性的爐灶，衛生固然是談不到，但是對於火災問題，實在可怕。大則可以影響別人的生命，簡絕可以說是整個社會的問題。所以前决租界當局，曾經嚴厲取締擱樓，而人人對此，亦具戒心，那裏知道，事過境遷，大家都淡然忘之，而一班牟利的二房東，鑑於房子需要的迫切，大動其腦筋，不惜任何犧牲，用其巧妙掩飾的手段，向當局請領照會，近日又已數見不鮮。再是這樣的繼續蔓延，則公衆危險，亦必繼續增加，關於社會者，亦必更多憂慮。</p>
<p>此種情形，以筆者隣近的望志路永吉里為最盛，已經翻樓搭擱者，却可指數，而暗中秘密進行者，尙大有人在，還望當局立即制止之，以免災害。</p>
<h3>一個人發財　千萬人挨餓</h3>
<h3>世界四傑的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 殷三郎</p>
<p>說起世界上的四個人傑，想讀者都會知道的吧，那就是德國希特勒，意國首相墨索里尼，中國的蔣總裁，和蘇俄的史太林，他們的被世人目之為人傑，是稱頌他們的政績。雖然各國的政策主義都不同，但他們的衣食住行，却一樣地站在不浪費，很節儉，很耐勞的陣綫上的，我們如果把目前上海富翁對於衣食住行的奢淫程度去對比一下，是感到怎樣地慚愧呀！</p>
<p>衣</p>
<p>希特勒生平有一僻性，就是不喜歡穿嗶嘰之類的毛織物，所以他的西服也大部是絨的居多，它最愛的要算哈尼其絨，是柏林亨皮隆廠的出品，而且價錢也便宜，德國的中上階級人民都穿得起，只合到法幣六十餘元而巳。墨索里尼因為出身貧苦，所以現在雖貴為一國首相，對於衣服，它喜歡穿那件灰藍色的上將軍服，但質地也不見得如何高貴，至於禮服或便裝，除了親屬等的宴會或騎馬作郊遊外，是偶然穿着的。蔣總裁在平時，都以穿長袍為多，袍料是普通的毛織物，偶然有幾件較為値錢的禮服而巳！它的上將制服和西服的穿着，要視其時間和性質而定了，不過，它的原料總是國產，舶來品不會有一件的。史太林的喜歡穿着嗶嘰，正和希特勒的性情相反，大概衣服以國產原料製成為多，外貨較少，軍服與便服中，則毛織物居多數，大部穿的是軍服。</p>
<p>食</p>
<p>希特勒喜歡吃甜的東西，最忌的是刺激性食物，據說因為醫生騐過他的體質是極不合宜的緣故，但每餐畢後，他喜歡大吃水菓，記得前年夏季，他正避暑在渥尼塔城時，在某决餐後，竟一决吃下七隻蘋菓，致害了一决很嚴重的腸胃病，月餘方吿痊愈呢！墨索里尼的吃的個性，却和希特勒相反，它喜歡刺激性，幾乎每一件都有這味兒，它愛吃耳磨共鯊魚，（產在南菲洲，馬來羣島）和野兎等獸肉。蔣總裁的吃，每餐亦不過五六樣菜　而已，我們知道有些富戶人家，食必山珍美味，一至宴會，更是加倍鋪張。我們看了蔣總裁的節的勤儉的美德，就應該深切的警惕覺悟。蔣總裁喜食金陵板鴨，金華蔣腿，飯食完全是故鄉奉化風味，史太林愛鹹味，和吃各種野獸的肉，鳥類也喜歡的，那海馬，麋鹿的鮮嫩的肉，最配它的胃口，大的一星期中，總有一二决用來佐餐的。</p>
<p>住</p>
<p>墨索里尼和蔣總裁的性情有些相同的，都是喜歡淸靜和整潔，屋中陳設，只須簡單而切合美觀，不要如何華麗，最好能够別具一種鄕村風味。說到希特勒，史太林的私邸，却很富麗堂皇的，那希特勒的官邸是世界聞名的尼芬克　　　，而史太林除了在莫斯科亞塞沙河畔的別墅較華麗外，至於官邸就很平常了。</p>
<p>行</p>
<p>我們如果把每人個性去推測它的行，倒很有些準確的，像墨索里尼和希特勒，因愛吃獸肉而歡喜打獵，捕魚；而蔣總裁是最喜歡登臨山岳，憑弔古蹟，平日更孜孜小倦的研究國事，至於戲院，酒樓等處是非萬不得已決不前往的。史太林愛看戲，騎馬，和游泳，它更愛騎馬一項，因它從幼就過慣戎馬生活，所以騎馬就成了它的嗜好了。</p>

<h3>外滙黑市應否維持</h3>
<p>— 施維濤</p>
<p>自軍興以來，吾國原有之通商口岸，幾盡入日軍掌握；而經濟統制之企圖，亦隨以俱來。如華北聯合準備銀行及華興銀行之創設，發行偽鈔，圖以替代法幣之流通。華中公司等之設立，華北貿易之統制，在在足以見其野心之大。顧迄今仍未如其原定計劃之順利進行者，法幣之基礎鞏固，為人民所普遍信用，甚且羣相窖藏，視同現金，收入日偽鈔後，莫不隨時用出，當為其主因之一。而法幣所以能獲人民之信用者，由於偽幣本身之不可靠，及人民信任政府而外，維持上海公開巿塲（而所謂黑巿）之匯價，使法幣可以隨時自由買取外匯，固會有不可磨滅之功績。最近市上盛傳平準基金亦將不予維持上海黑市外匯之說。惟維持與吾，其間孰得孰失，關係甚大，爰不揣剪陋，就管見所及，一硏討之。</p>
<p>在討論黑巿外匯應吾維持以前，請先就現行維持政策之利弊，作一比較。</p>
<p>有利方面（一）維持黑巿外匯之最大功能，可使法幣隨時換得外滙，增强人民信仰，而抵制日偽鈔之侵入。日偽鈔大量侵入以後，可使其增發紙幣，作為軍費，减輕其本國之負擔，可以作為開發企業之資金，利用游擊區之物資，日方所獲之利益，或許將超過現在外匯巿塲中套取所得者。（二）其决為可使友邦之商業利益保全，博取外人好感。</p>
<p>弊害方面（一）因外匯之買賣，毫無限制，日方可以掠奪所得之法幣，自由獲得外匯。（二）造成上海之巨額入超，而進口貨中之棉花及小麥等，復為日方需用，幷非人民所需求。故外匯基金有轉輾流入日人手中之弊，須予防止。</p>
<p>綜上所述，則平準基金委員會維持黑巿之政策，實屬無可非議。但以無限制之政策，造成基金流入日方之痛心現象，實有加以改善之必耍。邇來報章雜誌著論及此者，不一而足，特彙集以資探討。</p>
<p>一，不維持外匯黑市，聽其自行漲落，自覓水準。此即平準會停止供給黑市外匯之謂。在正常情形之下，上海外匯市塲，本無供給之必要，蓋進出口之平衡，即可以使滙價穩定。換言之，即出口商對於法幣之需要，適等於進口商之供應，則法幣自能保持常態。頻年以來，上海雖經常為一入超口岸，但依照現在之匯價，已縮至四辦士左右。洋貨價格激漲，人民對於洋貨之需要自减，而出口貨則以匯價之利而激增，不難自覓水準也。但上海環境，異乎尋常，外匯之需要，不僅來自進口商；大部為日方在外匯黑巿中，以其搜括所得之法幣，猛扒外匯；更以日紗廠之大量訂購外棉。（自外匯暴縮之後，或有减少之望，然仍有待於數字之證明也。）試問在此種情形之下，益以金融市塲之動盪，人民搜購外匯黃金之風，上海出口所得之外匯，能與市塲之需求相適應乎？設平準會停止維持之後，日人在市塲中，以掠奪所得之法幣，以任何代價購進外滙，藉以破壤法幣信用；加以投機家之推波助瀾，盲目者之搜購外匯黃金，其後果將不堪設想矣。雖然法幣在內地之價値，決不因上海黑市之變動而减少；結果或將使法幣大量內流，迭成資金向後之可喜現像，但法幣逐漸內流之際，恐日偽鈔亦將隨以侵入，日人夢寐以求之所謂一東亞經濟協同體，」或將實現矣。要亦決非吾人所能贊同。蓋上海為阻止日人控制游擊區經濟堡壘，必需全力守衛者也。</p>
<p>二，由中外進出口商行，及中外匯兌銀行，組織外匯淸算所；施行自給自足制度。此種建議，如施行平時，則殊可貴。惟現行情形之下，則困難頗多。　如日人以較高之價，搜購外匯時；重賞之下，必有勇夫。出口商行，俱能不為利誘，嚴格遵守以外匯售諸淸算所乎？然則淸算所之價格，將隨日人所出之價下跌乎。但日人所持之法幣，固任何代價可以出售，淸算所之價格，又將隨以無限下跌乎？猶有進者，上海今方處於巨量入超情形之下，淸算所如無巨額基金，將何以求其平衡？凡此種種，均足為設立淸算所之障礙也。</p>
<p>三，外匯請核制即在上海亦施行現在內地之外匯請核制度，以供給必需品之外匯。如米煤等之平民日用品，限制非必需品，及資敵物品之進口。其定價應較內地之七辨士略低，或照現在之新水準四辨士上下。則所費不大，而平民之生計，得以安定不少。其後果依筆者之推測，可發生如下數點。</p>
<p>（一）黑市之依然存在關於此點，龔家麟先生會在銀錢界內戰後上海對外貿易及入超問題一文內說：「一先令二辨士半的官價買賣，實行了限制，於是出現了所謂現在的外匯黑市。如果此種黑巿買賣，再加限制；結果必定出現第二個黑巿。這個黑巿的匯價，當然是更低於新定價。結果外匯的供給者，必將彼等之外匯，在此第二黑巿塞售。結果政府統制銀行，豈非將只有外匯的賣出，而沒有買進了嗎？一但證諸自三月初平準會成立以來，外匯黑巿之情形，可知平準會亦常處於供方地位。其結果終屬軋付。與其如此，不如改用申請制，以有限之數目，使一般必需品有穩定之價格，人心　以安定。免得平準會為防止日人套取起見，時時使　價　縮，致整個金融市場，趨於混亂，一般平民必需品，亦與奢侈品比例上漲，影響平民生計。</p>
<p>（二）日方所能套取外匯必大為减少。蓋日方必待外匯之供方較多於進口商之需要時，方能獲得。而每决核准供給之外匯，因無法可以套取也。</p>
<p>（三）金融可較安定因採用請核制，不論日人在第二黑市採用何種政策，出高價收買外匯。一般必需品，因有外匯可得，不致隨之漲價。一般人民窖藏金條，外幣，囤積貨物之心理，必可大為减少。因一般人士之搜購金條外幣者，慮法幣之無限跌落，以保全個人資產者居多也。</p>
<p>（四）加强資金內流之傾向因上海之規定價格，旣較內地為低；則各匯往內地，自較有利。軍興以來，資金麕集上海，逗留不去，殊稱憾事。匯率之差額，及匯水之奇昂，或能稍資為推動之助力。惟上海投機，及套利買賣，　不加取締，恐亦不能有大效。蓋套利利息優厚，至一角二三分。幾可與印子錢相媲美，而手續簡便，風險極小。資金為其吸引，亦勢所必至也。如上所述，則請核制之施行，可較現在平準會所持政策，减體日人套取機會，義即可减少平準基金之支出；而不必時時採取緊急措置，使匯價暴落，人心惶惶。惟較諸斷然不維持之政策，則可較為穩健，不致有日偽鈔侵入之危險。蓋維持政策，固須支出基金，於我抗戰并無直接利益。但亦足以阻止日人經濟統制之企圖，减少其利用游擊區物資之機會。間接上有助於抗戰者殊大。故在現行情勢之下，當以採取請核制較為妥善也。</p>
<h3>郵票問題</h3>
<p>— 謝良先</p>
<p>郵票的善後問題自從某先生提出了之後，已經引起大量的注意；因為郵票在上海的流通數量很大，加以其作用為代替輔幣，質言之郵票巳成為一種非主要的通貨了。但是郵票畢竟是缺乏通貨性質的，按郵票的性質為預防勞力報酬之憑證物；設在購郵者觀之，類似遞延資產；反之在郵票發行者言，其以此種手段發行的負債，例用其勞務抵償。於是郵票用現金——法幣——或其他代巷通貨收回，可說向無此例，亦可謂是違反章程而非常困難了。但郵票在巿面上用作為輔幣是鐵一般的事實，許多以前不需要郵票的人現在都有一些。正如某先生說一樣商家大都有着十數兀的郵票，小販們也多有一火柴盒。</p>
<p>不久的將來，新輔幣的發行，這就是宣吿郵票使用的吿終，而且郵票的使用是人們為便利而採用，故其終止使用亦不須任何明命，立刻遭人拒絕。兼以若郵票不停止使用，則根據格來欣定律，是新貨幣不能流通的。這樣一來，存郵票的商家都對郵票發生厭惡，蓋其　儲過多呆滯資力，立求脫手；但另一方面郵票的需耍彈性是非常少的。吾入決不因火柴便宜而多用火柴；同樣亦不會因郵票過多而多寫幾封信。於是這些郵票只好過剩於社會上，雖然他或不像別種貨物之價格受供需關係影響至大。但人民對他的厭惡，足使其跌價了。現在一元錢買一百零五分，甚或買一百十五分的地方很多，正可作為明證。這使人民普遍的受到意外損失。將負担力言，其為害最烈者，　為小販。正造成經濟上最不公平的現象。况且流通於市面之郵票，因流通過頻，大都均為汚損。按郵損汚失其動用條規，那麽嚴格的說：人民不是以廢紙當作通貨嗎！這實在太危險了！也就是說自應救濟的。</p>
<p>但要使郵票從市場流到別一地方去是必順吸力的。　吸力不外乎收回，且收回者必須有吸力的原動力為必要條件。亦是必須有貨資力的扌行，但上面說過郵票是不能收回的，那麼誰來收回呢？這就需要很大的考慮了。面把我的意見寫出來，那當然是不不行的但不過來效野人之　曝而已。</p>
<p>我想郵票的收回最好就是在新輔幣發行的時候，以新輔幣兌換，這好像將票據再新一次一樣的。理想的，厚民的，兌換是十足兌換，但事上，若酌景社會上情形，而定一種减輕大衆損失的折率，亦無不可。——因為現在市場中已有充分跌價情形作統計資料，並且這樣可以鼓勵郵票因別種方法跳開市場，而免很多麻煩。於是裹面　有的困難就是發行新轉幣的銀行將怎樣處置這郵票呢？這我們第一要認清郵票若不由郵局收回是總等於廢紙的。為不圖衝突郵章起見，最好由輔幣發行者協同郵局將此項郵票作為押放款之押物，或再貼現之類似票據。約定分期價還，其子息當概為豁免。蓋中央銀行為調整通貨而受些損失，可為職責所在啊！郵局方而可償還一部而毀滅汚損郵票一部。其印刷費用之損失，可要求中央銀行之折率所得補貼。而共償還款項可由收入項下撥出，因郵局之會計上顯有其不準確其會計上勞務代價必為太高，因在此特殊情形下，一部分收入北為勞務之結果故也。且其不準確之數，必適合於流通作通貨用之郵票發行數量，故在收入劃出一部作為償債準備，實理之至當。幷可糾正會計錯誤，表示其眞實財政情形誠為一舉二得者也。</p>
<h3>日本經濟之前途（四續）</h3>
<p>— 馮美齊岸士譯</p>
<p>由此可知國外市場對日本經濟穩固之重要。該國外市場供給日本七分之四之進口，而購買其三分之一強之出口，而以外滙與之。此國外市場中，德意較不重要，一九三八年其供給日本之貨物約一八五百萬日元，而購取其出口之四〇百萬。三國貨物交換協定（包括「滿洲國」）或能使此數略增，惟增加數必不鉅。如歐戰發生，無論日本捲入與否，軸心國之貿易必自動切斷。</p>
<p>日本與英國之貿易遠較德　為　。一九三八年之概數：英國供給日本之貨品約值五五〇百萬日元，而所　日本之出口約六三〇百萬日元。加上法國與荷蘭及其屬地，此數界至六七五與八〇〇百萬，或為日本對外貿易之五分之二。如與該三國之貿易關係斷絕，日本將遭受　重之打　。東南亞方面，一九八年法屬安南，英屬馬來亞·與荷屬東印亞羣島，供給日　之貨物共值一五五百萬日元，而取其出口之一一〇百萬。如日人能按制骸數處殖民地，其所得之油，橡皮，錫，鐵礦，當可大於目今之貿易數字。他方面，如戰事使油井損壞，必使其生產大受影響。如大戰時德國整頓羅馬尼亞油生產之困難即其先例。故日本不能不預為之謀。如能迅即為其控制，所得經濟利益常甚巨。然日本對生棉，機器，製造金屬品，各種礦物，與非金屬之鉅大需要，該殖民地無有能供給者。（未完）</p>

<h3>投機外匯者認識不足</h3>
<p>— 龔家麟</p>
<p>外滙投機的活躍</p>
<p>自從上月間平準會再度停供黑市外匯後，不到幾天的工夫，外匯暗盤就又從六便士半落到四便士强。前週又因謠傳政府在英訂印紙幣十萬萬張，社會人心未免恐慌，投機家從中操縱撥弄，以致明暗一致縮進四便士關，造成了外匯黑市空前未有的緊况。</p>
<p>其實，添印巨量新鈔一事，不必政府及關係方面的確切吾認，我們單從常識上加以判斷，就可以斷定是無稽的。我們可以反問一下：如果政府眞的是想採行通貨膨脹，這種十分秘密要緊的消自會不會隨意洩露出來呢？疏忽到極點的人，也萬不會做出疏忽到如此地步的事。這種消息，顯然不是誤傳，就是有人在造謠中傷。這是我們可以想得到的。</p>
<p>然而投機與資金逃避的傾向，却變本加厲起來。據巿塲的估計，近來外滙的交易，有百分之九十以上是由於這種不正當的需要。以前做外滙投機生意的，還不過是限於些富有階和熟悉令融方面的人物，而現在却連一般少積蓄者都活動起來了。這種情形，是相當嚴</p>
<p>無疑的，投機家和資金逃避者近來的活動所以趨於如此熾熱，最基本的是因為對於法幣眞確的價値，沒有充份的認識。久處於半淪陷區的上海人，常常有一種錯覺，以為公開市塲上的匯價，便是法幣價値的表示。兩個月以前法幣黑巿匯價穩定在八便士二五的標準，他們便把法幣當做六折看（依法價十四便士半計），現在跌到了四便士以下，便連三折都不到了。準此而言，那末豈不是經過兩個月的工夫法幣的價値就跌落了兩倍以上嗎？試想這是可能的事嗎？這種想法是何等的錯誤！</p>
<p>在一個嚴格統制匯兌的國家，暗的發生是難免的；不過在政府的統治樣力完全的國家，暗市比較容易設法取締，所以它的活動範圍與力量，也比較小一些。我國金融中心的上海，已是淪陷區之一部，政府並沒有完全的權力來統制上海的滙巿，以致黑市造成這樣猖獗的局面，這是我們承認的：但我們並不能拿這局部的情形，來代表中國的全體。中國的各完整區域，現在貨物的輸出入仍照政府所規定的法定匯價計算，難道我們也能說法幣落價了嗎？再換一方面來說，日圓在上海現在不也是値不到四便士嗎？為什麼我們說日本仍維持着法定的匯價呢？</p>
<p>或者有人拿戰後法幣發行數量的增加來做通貨價値跌落的論證。誠然，法幣的發行額巳自戰前七月份的上四億四千五百萬元增至最近發表的二十六億餘元，增加了十二億元弱。但這些數額的增加，說是由於財政的需要，毌寗歸之於一種自然的趨勢，溯法幣發行額目民國二十四年十一月改革幣制以來，因金銀之收集，雜鈔之收換，及幣制之統一化即逐漸增加：二十四年十一月發行額五億七千數百萬元，至戰前二十六年七月未達兩年即增至十叫億餘元，幾達三倍之多，當時固未目為通貨膨脹也。戰後此種步驟繼續進行，且因貼放內地活潑金融而有特殊之需要，法幣在兩年內些許的增發，自未能遽認為通貨膨脹，這是很明顯的事。</p>
<p>再或者有人提出內地物價的騰貴，作為法幣購買力實質巳低落的口實。其實這是犯了觀察不足的錯誤。內地物價騰貴的，是偏於幾個大都市，而且騰貴得特別厲害的，是那些當地並不生產的「奢侈品」。這是大批比較富有階級的人員自淪陷區都巿移向內地都市，而內地都市的生產能力未能加以適應的緣故。至於大部的鄕間，物價却並沒有多少增高，這是我們需要明白的。在淪陷區都巿方面則物價的增高，主要的是因為運輸的阻礙與捐稅的增加而起，一旦爭得最後勝利恢復秩序後，法幣的購買力非但立刻就會恢復，而且更要發揚光大起來。</p>
<p>投機家所犯認識上的第二點錯誤，是以為目前的匯價只會縮下去，沒有回漲的希望，因此大家拼命做多頭，買近賣遠，以致匯價一天緊縮一天。但據我們推測，這種趨勢是决不會長久延持下去的。在這個三辦士半的低匯價，差不多將進口商完全排擠了出去，所剩下的需要者只不過是些多頭的投機者與愚笨的資金逃避者了。多頭的力量决不是無限的，隨着政府的加强緊縮滬巿通貨籌碼，與法幣眞實購買力和市匯價間不合理差別的增加，多頭投機家總會有總崩潰的一天，到那個時候，恐怕要搶先供塞也巳經來不及了。</p>
<p>還有一點，投機家亦當知所警惕：平準會現在雖已對滬黑市放棄維持，但並不是說一定就完全放縱不顧。平準會儘可酌量情形，運用巨大的經濟力量來制裁黑市，懲罰投機的活動，這並不是辦不到的事。</p>
<p>投機家的應有覺悟</p>
<p>投機是一種賭博，所謂「利益」當然是不可靠的。傾家蕩產於此者巳不知凡幾，而投機於此漲落倏忽的匯巿中，允為危險，在現在的時候，無論是為國家的利益或個人的利益着想，都已沒有不立刻改投這部資木到內地去生產的道理了，試舉理由四端：</p>
<p>（一）投資到內地去生產，在置備必需之外國生產工具及原料時，仍得依法定匯價取得外匯。</p>
<p>（二）內地工商業均未發達，大凡投資於此等處女地，利益必優厚，發展性亦必大。</p>
<p>（三）政府之保障完善，且有獎勵辦法。較之投機外漲或投資淪陷區，可靠得多。</p>
<p>（四）今日滬巿匯款內地，非但不出匯水，且有優厚貼費可得。但我們認為這只這是一種暫時的現象，投資者决不要失去這僩機會。</p>
<p>總之，我們認為在當前這種局面之下做外匯投機的和外匯儲蓄工作的，是一種極無聊的事。這種損人害己的不智行動應該立即自動停止，而將此部有用的資金轉移至內地直接從事於生產，或匯存法幣於內地銀行而間接從事於生產。</p>

<p>『……我國工業的前途，我國生絲工業的前途，祗有兩條出路，一則以至大的努力和犧牲，從事于民族解放革命，以爭取自已發展的自由而圖稱覇於世界。一即是乾脆的投降，以準殖民地的方式讓人家來「合作開發，」變自已為他人延續生命的肥料，……』</p>
<p>同時對于絲業未來的命運，有如下的估計：</p>
<p>『吾國民族工業的抬頭，是這决抗戰的戰果。抗戰的最後勝利，……也就是我國工業的發揚，吾國絲業再稱雄於世界的時候。吾國是一個農業國家，勝利後新興的工業，勢將使吾國躍進到一個新的時代。蠶絲企業，是農業與工業的綜合體係，那麽這個新時代，無疑是我國蠶絲業空前中興的有利時期。……』</p>
<p>這是誰都同意的準確的論斷，然而本文中，怎樣又說上海絲業的危機是必然經歷的過程呢？正因為這决戰爭，是中國民族資本向上發展，勝利未到達之前，在勢力範圍內留下來的工業，必然毫不放鬆的受到壓迫，以成為它所希望的，「以戰養戰」的資本。</p>
<p>江浙一帶淪陷後，上海絲業成為入甕之　，然而還是為了上海俱備着許多特殊條件的緣故，所以據傳對于統制上海絲業和淪陷區全部絲業，乃不得不分了若干步驟，這種傳聞，再加上過去以及目前事實上表現出來的眞相，上海絲業的將被襄括，大槪已將到臨實施割治的的時候了。</p>
<p>經濟上必然的進攻點</p>
<p>由于速戰速决高唱百年戰爭的無補于事，而已迫至戰事第二階段了，於是找出了「以戰養戰」的口號來對國內開付支票，對淪階區中來兌現，這在絲業上受到的襲擊，便是繼「統制」無錫以及京滬錢一帶蠶絲之後，來向上海絲業，作一非常嚴厲的對鎖，它封鎖原料的輸入，也封鎖成品的出口。</p>
<p>因為兩年來上海絲業本身缺點甚多，有隙可乘，進攻的方式，是採取了威脅利誘，欺詐恐嚇的雙管齊下的手法，現在把收購春繭的事件來看一看吧！</p>
<p>在春蠶上簇的時候，傳出消息，是拒絕一切人等前往內地收繭，包括第三國商人在內，這時上海絲業是充滿了悲觀的氣氛，然而不久却傳可以允許一切人等，無條件前往收蘭了，這時上海的絲業人心，悲觀變為僥倖，僥倖變作冒險，于是動員了三千萬元以上的資金，打了通行證往內地輸送之後，收繭竣事，接下去便是全部扣留，毫不通融，然而不久又表示出黃金萬能，衹要條件合意即可通行，這一策略，正是一　老戲，即先使之絕望，然後略加放鬆，以培養其妥協心理。所以鮮繭運滬，先是扣留，後是斤斤較量于「捐稅問題」，然而發展到現在，是老老實實在討論沒收百分之五十，放行百分之五十了。但是事實上，大批鮮繭還是留置在淪陷區中的交通綫上。（未完）</p>

<h3>旅美嚮導</h3>
<p>— 詢</p>
<p>時屆秋季，赴美留學學生，紛紛準備起程。本年的留美學生，因外滙暴漲，雖不若往年之多，但人數亦相當可觀。關於赴美留學手續，以及旅程等等，均已詳誌本刊，但初决赴美者，對於該國的生活以及一切，大都尙係十分隔膜，作者為便利一般出國留學學生以及預備赴美游歷或硏究學術者起見，特將該國的衣食住行各點，作一簡單的報吿，以供赴美者作一參考。</p>
<p>美國時計標準</p>
<p>美國東西因經度的不同，對於時計方面，亦有顯著的區別，以是時計標準亦分作四區。東部各州用「東部時間」（Eastern　Time）·中部各州用「中部時間」（Central　Time）；偏西各州用「高山時間」（Mountain　Time）；極西各州用「太平洋時間」（Pacifie　Time）。東中部有幾大城市如紐約·波士頓·芝加哥等地，夏天用所謂「節省日光時間」（Day　linht　savingtime），較標準時間早一小時，秋季仍然改回。鐵路，汽車輪船等時間表與車站上的時鐘，則全年用標準時間，夏季也不改，初决赴美者不可不加注意。</p>
<p>美加邊境</p>
<p>赴美留學或游歷者，除非預先把手續辦好，是不能到加拿大境。到美國東部去者，常要到尼加拉瀑布（MiagaraFalls）去遊覽。此地是美加兩國的交界，中間有一長橋，美國人到北面加拿大境觀賞瀑布是毫無限制的，但我國人若不小心，上橋時可不經美國移民局，下橋時便引出許多麻煩。如果能拿出護照，或者許你回來，吾則常要扣留幾日，等華盛頓我國大使館電報證明後，纔可放出，此點應特別注意。如果願意上橋參觀，須拿護照事先向橋頭移民局交涉，或可成功。加拿大方面雖有美景可賞，弱小民族在不平等待遇之下是享受不到的。米西根州的Detroit也有隧道與船隻通加拿大，此地情形與尼加拉差不多。亦要注意。（未完）</p>
<h3>陝省　致力交通建設</h3>
<p>西安通訊：陝省府鑒於客貨運輸之急要，現極力注意於交通建設，現據負責人聲稱，最近陝省對於交通建設，已有三大計劃，均在進行（一）由咸陽北行至同宮問公路，計程一百卅九公里，現正積極修築，預計明年三月間可以完成。（二）由寳鷄西南行經鳳縣至雙石舖之輕便鐵道，計一百零八公里為隴海路與省府機關所合辦，亦將完成，現正計劃貨運辦法。將來並擬展長至甘肅之微縣以達白水江云。（三）山白水江入嘉陵江南行至四川廣元之水道，為川甘陝三省交通聯絡綫，全長的三百三十公里。刻由陝建廳積極整理河道，修整縴路，預計十一月間可竣。將來三省交通貨運通暢，運費减輕，並可節省汽油，實屬交通之偉績</p>

<h3>小學教師的呼籲</h3>
<p>— （殷然等十四人）</p>
<p>反對增加學費來提高待遇</p>
<p>接到了一羣小學敎師的來信時，同時接到殷然先生等的「反對增加學費來提高待遇」一文。我們果然同情小學敎師生活的淸苦，但是增加學費來提高待遇，也不是妥善的解决辦法，因同時發表於左。　編者</p>
<p>秋季學期已開始，許多學校都在準備着開學了，正在這個時候，有不少的學校敎師們為了目前孤島上物價的高漲，不足維持一家的生活，而請求學校當局加薪，但學校當局却說是經濟窘迫，而事出兩難，致有人主張增加學費來補救，這一個問題，是非常値得討論的。因為這不單是敎師的生活問題而已，而是整個教育事業的發展問題，我們十四人謹以小學敎師的地位，願意表示一點坦白的意見，並請編者先生賜借一角，昭示社會人士。</p>
<p>戰後孤島上的小學校，比了戰前多起一倍，因了份子及背景的複雜，所以學費也有天淵之隔。往往甲校高級的學費是六七元，而乙校高級的學費須二十至三十元，兩校的收入雖是道麽不平勻，但敎師的待遇却一樣的，原來甲校的收入低微而影響敎師待遇的菲薄，固不必說，而乙校的校長却以學校作商店為目的，祇知惟利是圖，充盈個人私囊，一方面更抑低敎師的待遇，除了一學期以五個月計算外，還有其他八折九扣的苛刻待遇。於是，敎師們每月所得二三十元的薄薪，怎能維持一家數口的生活，而校長自己則高樓大厦，沉湎聲色之塲，不知怎樣謂之「敎育」，至於我們敎師的待遇菲薄，而不足維持一家生活的問題，決不是增加學費後就可以加薪我們，而得到實惠的，相反地祗有使校長的私囊更見結實，校長巴不得敎師們喊出「增加學費來提高待遇」的口號，這好像二房東巴不得大房東喊「加租」一樣，然而結果呢？還是倒霉了一般小學生，為了增加學費，而自己家長的不堪負担，致不得不忍痛輟學，使一批批的小學生走向失學羣裹去，豈不可惜！這不是動搖了整個敎育事業和國家前途是什麽？我們為了國家的前途，為了敎育事業的發展，要誓死不願增加學費，我們大聲地喊出「反對增加學費來提高待遇」的</p>
<p>我們誠意希望社會的熱心人士能够為我們我一個妥善的辦法，並且更期望校長們摸出良心來辦敎育扌好！</p>
<h3>一羣小學教師來函</h3>
<p>我們是小學敎師，當我們發現我們的艱苦生活已有多少在貴報十五日載「一部份敎職員呼籲加薪」一文中流露出來時，不禁感動得眼淚也流下來了。其實在海上敎育界中過着和我們同樣生活的何止千萬，又何止我們受着如此的激動呢！</p>
<p>眞的，我們小學敎員的生活太苦了，平時苦，「八一三後更苦，但在最近外匯跌落物價暴漲後的艱苦程度扌達到了最高度。在這種情形下，我們要求安定的生活是不可能的。我們在向學生喊着「小貓，白馬」的當兒，同時又不能不為本日的柴米油鹽祖心。這種生活上的矛盾如何統一起來呢？節的吧！但是我們小學敎師的耗費本來不多，甚至沒有；而飯郤不得不吃，房子不得不租，有時衣服也要添上一件，二件（大都學校當局者認為衣着太寒酸，會影響到兒童的來學。）結果問題還是沒有解決。社會上有不少人慨嘆着學生程度的低劣，敎師的不負責，這些也許都是事實，但他們忽略了另一個事實：敎師在飢寒交迫之下是無法負責起來的。</p>
<p>因為要安心的做一點事，要求加薪的運動是時時醞釀着的，然而也不過醞釀而已，從沒有向學校當局正式表示的一天。誰都知道目前社會上失業的人正多，要換一批新的敎師絕不是困難的事；同時現正在全國精誠團結共赴國難的時候，更不應該引起一切足以分散力量的內在糾紛。但是生活的威脅要比任何的威脅厲害些，於是不少人發出了這樣的疑問：「難道永遠的做小學敎師嗎？那裹是生活的歸宿呢？」在這樣的疑問下，敎師日日為目前的生活憂心，時時為未來的出路掛牽，結果，小學敎師這職務便成了大家轉入其他職務的階梯。如此，將來的敎育事業會形成怎樣的局面呢！這實是敎育界一個嚴重的危機！我們說這是敎育界的危機者，因為我們雖未必是「為敎育而敎育」的敎育至上主義者，但我們和教育究竟特別接近，感情特別深厚，我們旣無力解決這危機，又不忍見這種危機更形發展下去，所以敬冋各學校當局及社會人士發出要求改善生活的呼籲！</p>
<p>我們相信我們的要求改善生活完全是一種正當的要求，同時我們史相信這種要求只有在學校當局和敎師雙方于平等互惠的原則上進行扌能得到美滿的解决。基于這原則，我們對于戴仰仁，金竟等百餘先生提出的「學校當局在酌加學費的方法來提高敎師的薪給」的辦法完全贊同；並提出各學校增設義務班，暑期班，經濟班，補習班，敎育界設立「同人消費合作社」（這樣的合作社目前巳有一個，名稱是「上海市小學敎育界同人消　費合作社」）「敎職員生活互助會」，商業界組織「物價平準會」等也可帮助問題的解决。我們認為這不僅是我們敎界同人的問題，而也是整個敎育界的問題，整個社會的問題，深望社會各界人士對這問題多多發表意見共謀迅速的合理的解决。</p>
<h3>啟事</h3>
<p>今日廣吿擁擠，「雨天過靑」暫停。春秋編輯室</p>
<h3>春滿西域</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Out　West　With　The　Hardys”</p>
<p>「春滿西域」是　着……情　初開」「初解風情」等後的所謂法官哈代家庭片。在這家庭里，劇作者創造了幾個典型的人物：法官哈代（父親），母親，安德烈（子），曼麗（女），和米萊（姑母）。但是作為每一部法官哈代片的主要人物的是安德烈和曼麗，在前兩部作品公映的時候，大家會指出。。以挑撥的態度來描寫小女兒的情愛是錯誤的，其為害之烈，將甚於其他以色情為誘惑的電影。「春滿西域」果然還是以這一對小女兒的戀愛為主題，但是劇作者已經修改了過去的錯誤：如曼麗到了西部後，熱戀上牧人瑞霍爾特，因向父親請婚。哈代知道道是女兒的一時感情衝動，只允許他們先行試婚，讓他們在試行的共同生活中，漸漸的發現各自的或對方的缺點，免致後悔。這合理的裁判——指示兒　以正確的戀愛眞義，該是這部法官哈代家庭片比前者可取之處。</p>
<p>因為法官哈代家庭片的賣座，米高美公司已經固定了這個家庭的「演員表」：父親（魯易史東），母親（費霍爾婷），子（米蓋羅納），女（茜雪簡派克）和姑母（前拉哈婷）。在這五位演員中，米蓋羅納是目前好萊塢最紅的童星，所以法官哈代片的導演者都集中力量在他身上，這部「春滿西域」也不能例外。</p>
<p>如寫米蓋羅納頹强的性格，有以下的例：（一）米蓋羅納換了全部裝束，冀成一騎術家，看見牧人彎着腿的走路姿態，他也效學着，但是騎到馬上，跌得要命：（二）他偷至牧塲騎馬，把「卡立哥」（馬名）的前腿用　　了‘，可是飛奔的時候，來了得人翻馬仰；（三）他和廈基（一個八歲的西部女孩子）賭　槍法，　基一連五槍把一個鐵　轟到半空中，嚇得米　羅納逃走。以上幾塲戲都處理得很生動，有趣，也明顯地刻劃了米蓋羅納的性格。</p>
<p>米蓋羅納的演技，從「孤兒樂園」到現在，無論他的面部表情和動作，都定型了，至少沒有新的發展；可是他做童星的時期很短了，這是有碍於他的前途的。</p>
<p>這里叉發現了一個優秀的童星，就是飾賈基的維姬妮惠爾特，她的天眞活潑，悲哀快樂，不做作，不裝腔，這是難得的。</p>
<p>魯易史東，費霍爾婷，及茜雪蘭派克都稱職。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Land at Nantou, Bao'an: Repeatedly Attacked Fiercely by Chinese Forces; Japanese Army Resolves to Isolate Hong Kong from Mainland China; Hong Kong Authorities Actively Deploy Various Wartime Preparations; US to Allocate Several Warships to Strengthen Far East Defenses</h3>
<p>Xingning: After Japanese troops landed at Nantou, Bao'an, they were repeatedly attacked fiercely by Chinese forces, suffering heavy casualties and huge losses. For several days, more than 150 corpses were transported to the vicinity of Shenzhen for cremation, while the wounded soldiers were sent back to Japanese warships. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: Japanese troops who have occupied Shenzhen have been constructing fortifications to guard against Kowloon for several days. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The local authorities consider it serious that the Japanese military spokesman in South China stated, "Since the British side continues to assist the Chinese side, the Japanese side finds it necessary to blockade the periphery of Kowloon," because most of the fresh food here comes from mainland China. (20th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The authorities are actively deploying various wartime facilities in Hong Kong, and all truck drivers, whether unemployed or not, must be registered. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to foreign news, the US President is planning to redistribute the Pacific Fleet in order to enhance the US position in the Far East when Japan takes retaliatory measures against the US for abolishing the treaty. It is further reported that the US will allocate some warships to be stationed at British and French naval bases close to China. It is also learned that the US President has suggested to the Soviet Union that if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union form an agreement, the US is also willing to take parallel actions to enhance the democratic forces in the Far East and promises to provide financial assistance to China. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Japanese army in South China declared that the Japanese army has seized the border line of Hong Kong, and if Britain does not stop its aid to China, Japan will blockade the area around Hong Kong. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, a military spokesman here declared that the Japanese army in South China feels that if Britain continues to aid the Chinese government, it will have to isolate Hong Kong from mainland China. The spokesman expressed regret for any inconvenience this may cause to the citizens of Hong Kong, but said that as long as Britain does not stop aiding the Chinese government, this Japanese action is difficult to avoid. The spokesman also stated that in the area of Shatoujiao, a British border area occupied by the Japanese army on August 17th, there is a newly built automobile highway between Menjiang (transliteration) and Sanshui in mainland China, and military supplies and other goods are imported into mainland China from Hong Kong along this road. (20th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, the Central Daily News editorial stated that since the Japanese army occupied Shenzhen, Hong Kong's position is similar to that of Tianjin at present. Britain's biggest mistake is having a mysterious belief in the appeasement policy, but it does not know that Japan's expansion policy is its predetermined plan. If Britain tries to compromise with Japan again, Singapore will also be threatened by Japan. (20th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Minor Clashes in Southern Hubei</h3>
<p>Pingjiang: There have only been skirmishes in the Southern Hubei area in recent days. On the morning of the 17th, a certain Chinese unit annihilated more than 50 Japanese soldiers in the area northwest of Baini Bridge, and destroyed a Japanese truck loaded with more than 20 Japanese soldiers with hand grenades at Zhonghuopu, all of whom were killed. Furthermore, the Japanese army at Baini Bridge launched retaliatory attacks on the surrounding Gaoling area, but were repelled by the Chinese army. On the 17th, the Chinese army annihilated more than 40 Japanese soldiers in the Dagui Town area between Tongshan and Yangxin, capturing nine rifles and a thousand rounds of ammunition. On the 18th, more than 100 Japanese soldiers launched a counterattack against the Chinese army and fierce battles took place in the area east of the town for half a day, during which the Chinese army killed more than 50 Japanese soldiers. (19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>If Chinese Troops Are Resolved to Counterattack, They Will Certainly Gain an Absolute Advantage: Opinions of Foreign Military Experts; Generalissimo Chiang Is Busy Preparing Air Force and Mechanized Units; A General Offensive Will Be Ordered When the Training of Three Million New Troops Is Completed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to the opinions of Chinese observers, it seems unlikely that the Japanese army will continue to launch a large-scale offensive into the Chinese interior. The Japanese army will garrison key points with a small number of troops, while at the same time tightening the blockade of the coast and establishing the so-called "Federal Government" to undermine China's economic and financial system. The Japanese army will continue to carry out air raids on Chongqing, military bases, and industrial centers in an attempt to destroy the production efforts of free China. Today, the focus of the problem is whether the Chinese army has sufficient artillery, mechanized units, aircraft, and other weapons of war to take the offensive and achieve victory. Today, it is only necessary to recover any truly important major city or to defeat the Japanese army greatly to destroy the Japanese army's adventurous work. Since the fall of Hankou, all sectors of Chinese society have speculated whether the Japanese army will continue to advance into the interior, or be satisfied with obtaining the rich Yangtze River basin and various parts of North and South China at present, and then devote their energy to economic and political fields. Those who believe that the Japanese army will continue to advance into the interior think that there are three possibilities: (1) to attack northwest in order to cut off land communication between China and the Soviet Union; (2) to attack southwest, aiming to cut off railway and highway communication between China and Vietnam and Burma; (3) to attack directly west, aiming at Chongqing, the wartime capital of China. The various signs in the past ten months are sufficient to prove that Japan has decided not to expand its military activities in China, but to use economic and political methods to trap free China. The war against China's legal tender, the attempt to establish a so-called "Federal Government," Wang Jingwei's peace movement, and the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Yangtze River basin are all sufficient to support the above-mentioned opinions. Generally, people believe that the success or failure of Japan's policy depends entirely on whether the Chinese army can take a strong and effective general counterattack. The Japanese military authorities believe that the Chinese army does not have this ability, so they are currently garrisoning the cities and towns along the Yangtze River with only a small number of troops, and their strength is particularly weak. According to the opinion of foreign military experts, if the Chinese army is resolved to launch a counterattack, it will certainly be able to recover all the cities and towns on the south bank of the Yangtze River from Hankou to Nanjing. However, this type of counterattack must be assisted by aircraft and artillery to be successful. The Chinese military authorities do not want to disclose their military plans at present. According to claims from all circles in China, it is obvious that Generalissimo Chiang has not ordered any large-scale counterattacks, but is preserving his military strength and weapons of war in order to use them for a major decisive battle when the time comes. It is heard that there are a total of three million new troops currently in training, in addition to the approximately 200,000 people who have already taken up arms. Generalissimo Chiang is currently busy training soldiers for the air force, artillery, and mechanized units. When these three million people have completed their training, and the air force, artillery, and mechanized units are all ready for action, Generalissimo Chiang will definitely order a general counterattack. As for where the Chinese army will launch this major attack, whether it will take the province of Shanxi to enter North China, along the Yangtze River in Central China, or in South China to attack Guangzhou, it is still too early to make this prediction now.

<h3>Japanese Planes in Four Waves Raid Jiangxi; Shangrao Savagely Bombed Twice; Various Locations in Guangdong Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Ji'an: Twenty-four Japanese planes, on the 20th, in four waves raided Jiangxi. The first wave of six planes flew over [blanks in original text], dropping several incendiary bombs, killing and wounding more than 20 people. The second wave of six planes patrolled the area around [blanks in original text]. The third wave of six planes invaded Shangrao, dropping bombs. The fourth wave of eight planes, at around 5 PM, passed through Fengcheng and fled towards Zhangshu, dropping several bombs before fleeing. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Shaoguan: Three Japanese planes, on the morning of the 20th, raided various locations in Guangdong, dropping bombs in counties such as Wengyuan and Lianping, and then raided Qujiang, dropping six bombs, killing and wounding one person each. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Shangrao: Fifteen Japanese planes, this morning, in two waves savagely bombed this place. The first wave of six planes, at 9 AM, fled from Nanchang to the skies above Rao, dropping more than ten bombs, including several incendiary bombs. The second wave of six planes, at 2:15 PM, again fled to the skies above Rao, dropping more than ten bombs, destroying more than 100 civilian houses, and killing and wounding more than 100 innocent civilians. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Mr. Lai Bojun, a missionary with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, witnessed the situation of the Japanese plane bombing of Jiading southwest of Chengdu yesterday. According to him, a large fire broke out in the commercial area of Jiading after the Japanese planes dropped bombs, and the loss of property must have been very heavy. Furthermore, there are very few air-raid shelters in the Jiading area, and the city walls have not been demolished, so it is extremely difficult for civilians to evacuate after an air-raid warning is issued, so the number of casualties must also be heavy. It is heard that the only hospital in Jiading is the one established by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The New Life Movement Headquarters in Chongqing has now dispatched two doctors and two nurses to provide medical assistance. As for Mr. Lai Bojun's witnessing of the Japanese plane bombing of Jiading, it was also accidental. When an air raid alert was issued in Chongqing yesterday, Mr. Lai Bojun happened to be at the airport of China National Aviation Corporation. In principle, the safest way for a commercial aircraft to encounter an air raid is to take off and patrol. Mr. Lai Bojun was able to board the aircraft and arrive in the sky above Jiading after the Japanese planes bombed it, and witnessed the bombing situation in Jiading. Also, Haikang, 40 miles southwest of Guangzhou Bay, and Lianjiang, 40 miles northwest of Guangzhou Bay, were also bombed by Japanese planes yesterday. (20th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>General Feng Yuxiang Broadcasts: China's Dangerous Period Has Passed; The People Must Not Hesitate to Sacrifice and Endure Difficulties; Maintain Internal Unity and Carry Out the Mission of Resistance</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Tonight, General Feng Yuxiang delivered a broadcast speech entitled "How to Strive for Victory and the Second Phase of the War of Resistance." Feng asked the people of China to not hesitate to make necessary sacrifices, to endure all kinds of difficulties, to maintain internal unity, and to carry out the mission of resisting Japan. Feng stated that today, China's chances of defeating Japan are greater than at any time in the past, while the difficulties of the Japanese army are increasing day by day. One is the decline in the fighting spirit of the Japanese army, the second is the increase in the anti-war sentiment of the Japanese army, and the third is the exhaustion of Japanese manpower. All of these are signs that Japan is bound to be defeated. However, there is no such phenomenon in the Chinese army. Feng stated that the cooperation between the army and the people is the main factor for military victory, but this spirit of cooperation is not accidental. If the people have no army, they will be completely trampled upon by others. If the army does not have the support of the people, its power will be difficult to exert. Therefore, the cooperation between the people and the army is an inevitable trend and a guarantee of victory. Feng further stated that China's dangerous period has passed, and what China needs from now on is to accomplish the mission of resisting Japan. Feng strongly condemned Wang Jingwei and his ilk, and said that during the current period of national crisis, everyone should take the interests of the nation and the people as a prerequisite, and should not undermine the war front with personal ambitions and desires for leadership.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Future of Britain's Tough Stance</h3>
<p>Seeing Britain floating and sinking in the adverse current, the world is sometimes worried and sometimes happy, unable to restrain itself. World opinion is sometimes praise and sometimes disparagement, and cannot come to a consensus. What will Britain do to deal with itself and the world? Who does not want to get to the bottom of it?</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Chamberlain, regretting that his actions were not understood by critics, once angrily said to his parliament, "Our painstaking efforts are often wantonly criticized by irresponsible people." How sad and angry his words are. However, judging by the momentary changes in worry, happiness, praise, and disparagement, it can be seen that the world, towards Britain and towards Chamberlain, did not initially have any preconceived notions that they must be spoken ill of. The reaction is like this, it is actually self-inflicted. Did you not see the scene after the surrender of Czechoslovakia? How can Chamberlain's so-called painstaking efforts be sought to be understood by people? Recently, for the issue of the Free City of Danzig, he repeatedly stated that he must fulfill his obligation to guarantee Poland. Yesterday, he further stated that he must avoid anything that smacks of mediation. Words of praise from all over the world came back unexpectedly. Did you not see the issue of the four suspects in Tianjin? As soon as the extradition was mentioned, it was not justified by world opinion, and public opinion in both China and Britain was in an uproar. However, for refusing to hand over the Tianjin savings to Japan and refusing to discuss the currency issue in the occupied areas, world opinion suddenly allowed it as a tough stance. Beneficial to the overall situation. All cause and effect; as the echo responds; worry, happiness, praise, and disparagement, are they accidental? The world has its own eyes and ears, and justice resides in the hearts of the people, and cannot be deceived. Can one not be awed, or can one know where to struggle.</p>
<p>Those who allow Britain's attitude to be tough and believe that it is beneficial to the overall situation: in addition to the Danzig issue and the Tianjin savings and currency issue, such as the recent increase in the army in the Singapore military port, such as the mobilization of warships in Hong Kong, not allowing the Japanese side to transport supplies in transit, and such as yesterday's widespread rumors of preparing to declare the abolition of the British-Japanese commercial treaty in response to the Japanese anti-British movement, these are all signs of toughness. While the situation in Europe is becoming more and more tense, the world believes that Britain may not be able to avoid yielding to the Far East, but now it is the opposite, which is a unexpected theme to praise Britain. Or not only that: such as regarding the four suspects, when it expressed its preparation to extradite, the critics believed that Britain had abandoned its traditional fairness, and abandoned its founding rule of law. But it meets the strong and violent, and nothing is unsacrificable, and it also contains shame and humiliation, and there is nothing to spare. However, based on the request of the people, London has already allowed the use of the "Habeas Corpus Act." This measure is not only about the safety and happiness of the four suspects, but also shows that the British government can still take care of fairness and respect the rule of law. The importance of this in meaning far exceeds the issue of extradition and non-extradition. As for the Tianjin savings and the currency in the occupied areas, from the beginning of the negotiations, it never hesitated to establish a so-called preliminary agreement. This form seems to be only seeking temporary peace, and nothing cannot be promised. Now it can resolutely reject unreasonable demands, indicating that the Tokyo negotiations have been stopped, or even completely broken down. This measure is not only enough to comfort the world with the savings and currency issue, but also shows that Britain can still maintain its national free and independent policy, and there is a bottom line for concessions and compromises. This is also an answer that those who have been seeking oppression of Britain have not discovered for a long time, and it is what those who cherish Britain are happy about.</p>
<p>Although, all the problems in Europe and the Far East still exist, and they have not ended because of Britain's ability to be tough. The meaning and value of Britain's tough stance have not been determined by today's stage. The world's praise of Britain is also based on the matter, just right, and cannot be relied upon as a constant. It must be clearly recognized that the encounter after the tough stance may be an intensification of oppression. Will Britain not repeat its knees because it cannot bear the oppression? Or will it be moved by the sweet words and heavy profits of temptation and delve into the trap? All these questions are not to say that they distrust Britain; only to believe that those who overcome such questions, rather than saying that they are tied to trust in Britain, are better said to be tied to Britain's determination in the future. The determination is where it is, and it is not enough to show a tough posture, and it is not enough to be satisfied with the effect of the tough posture; it must not hesitate to be difficult and dangerous, and not try to be lucky, and take the preparation and action of being tough as the backing of the tough attitude. Today's international community is not a competition of propaganda, not a competition of posture, but a measurement of interests and strengths. As a result of the measurement, we firmly believe that Britain has its own interests to protect, and has its own strengths to rely on; however, those who gamble with it are using the pain of the moment as a bet, and Britain must be prepared for a corresponding sacrifice. Although we suspect that the aggressors do not have the courage to open a dispute with Britain, as far as Britain is concerned, this is the basis for determination and the capital for determination.</p>
<p>The British authorities may think that they have always had determination, but the various signs in the past are not enough to be clear evidence of determination. We also sincerely hope to respect what the British authorities have declared and believe that they have always had determination, but the various signs in the past at least lead people to mistakenly believe that they are hesitant. The British authorities may think that the responsibility for the misunderstanding does not lie with Britain; however, in fact, other countries have failed to understand Britain's determination. The misunderstanding that Britain is hesitant has caused considerable damage to the dignity of the British state, the credibility of Britain in the international community, the material interests of British merchants in the Far East and elsewhere, and the feelings and friendship of China and several other nations towards Britain. This is what the British authorities should carefully examine in addition to handling determination and showing a tough stance. If it is said that being tough is only a posture, and it is not a determination; then the British authorities must have other determination: that is, those who oppress Britain, it is not that Britain takes a step back, or takes two or three steps back to be satisfied, nor is it any compromise in the British mind that they can be satisfied. Then, if Britain is still unable to abandon its intention of compromise and retreat when it shows a tough stance, it can only resolve to kneel down, withdraw its flag and stop its drums and return to the British Isles. Europe and the Far East are one and the same, and the situation is no different.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Water Shortage Reaches Emergency Status; British Concession Water and Electricity Supply Halted; Racecourse Road South Flooded to 18 Inches</h3>
<p>Due to rising water levels, the supply of electricity and water to the British Concession in Tianjin was halted tonight. However, the French Concession still has electricity, so the British Concession is negotiating with the French Concession about connecting electricity. In the former German Concession, the water level reached three feet. Japanese sentries at the end of the racecourse also retreated due to the rising water. Furthermore, many areas within the Japanese-occupied zone were flooded, so many Chinese refugees carrying luggage and utensils entered the British Concession. The Japanese side was especially accommodating and did not obstruct them. At the same time, many of the milk sheds run by White Russians also moved into the British Concession, so the milk needed in the British Concession can be spared inspection by Japanese soldiers. There are also many other horses being transferred into the British Concession. The Japanese military road surrounding the British and French Concessions is now also in danger of being flooded, as the water level is only eight to ten inches away. The Asahi Road in the Japanese Concession was flooded today. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>The southern section of the Tianjin racecourse is already 18 inches underwater, so an emergency state will likely be declared tomorrow. The city's low-lying commercial areas are in immediate danger of being flooded. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>The flood in the southern section of the Tianjin racecourse is spreading rapidly. The terrain there is relatively high, so the sudden flooding was quite unexpected. The British Concession power plant was flooded at 3 PM this afternoon, resulting in an interruption in the supply of electricity and tap water, causing great anxiety among the residents. Emergency arrangements are currently being made, hoping that the tap water supply can be restored. It is reported that the British authorities have contacted the Belgian power company supplying electricity to the French Concession to temporarily supply electricity to the British Concession. Today, no fewer than 50,000 refugees have fled to Tianjin. The British Concession Municipal Council has telegraphed the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Bowater, requesting him to raise funds to aid the refugees. Some of the wealthier refugees have come to Tianjin by oxcart or mule cart, carrying large amounts of furniture. In addition, a considerable number have come to Tianjin by boat. The Japanese sentries at the various checkpoints seem indifferent to these displaced refugees. Some Japanese soldiers are wearing rubber boots, while others have rolled up their trousers to their knees. The Japanese sentry posts are surrounded by thick earthen walls. At present, five or six hundred cattle have been transported into the concession, all in good health. Although there will be no problems with the milk supply thereafter, there is clearly not enough open space within the concession to accommodate this large number of livestock, which is a cause for concern. Several sections of the electrical grid around the concession have been submerged in water. People generally hope that the Japanese have turned off the electricity. Looking out from the end of Racecourse Road, several houses outside the concession can be seen partially submerged in water. A Reuters reporter patrolled along the border of the concession and saw that several low-lying areas had become a vast expanse of water. The French Concession authorities are currently working to strengthen the levees around their territory. Japanese engineers are also participating in the construction of earthen dikes to protect the Japanese Concession. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>The residents of the British Concession in Tianjin woke up this morning to find their area still dry, but the area flooded by water from the ditches is gradually expanding. As far as is currently known, Special District One has not suffered serious flooding, because the water from the breach in the southern dike is flowing northwest, endangering the area near Nankai University. The new military road built by the Japanese on the high dike is now only eight inches above the water surface. The water level has risen only a few inches since last night, but the water has reached the mud wall built along the riverbank, so the Hai River now presents a magnificent view, resembling a large river. It is rumored that the former Russian Concession is deeply flooded, with some places three feet deep, but this has not been confirmed. The southern section of the British Concession, which has not been fully developed and still has many grasslands, is now almost a pasture, with cattle and horses grazing there. It is reported that the Japanese allowed cattle and horse owners last night to drive their livestock from the flooded area through the blockade into the British Concession, and also allowed some refugees to enter the concession. The disaster victims each carry the few items they can hold, mostly wading through the water, soaked below the waist, a truly pitiful sight. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Huai River Rises Sharply; Anhui Dikes Collapse</h3>
<p>The Huai River in a certain area of northern Jiangsu has risen sharply. The dikes in various places have not been properly repaired since the National Army withdrew to the west, making the situation very dangerous. Five sections of the dikes on the southern bank within Anhui Province have collapsed. (20th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement Intensifies</h3>
<p>According to news from Beiping today, the Japanese have established the so-called "Beiping Citizens' United Congress" here, with the aim of expanding the anti-British movement to various Asian countries. It is reported that those hoping to join as comrades are teachers, journalists, merchants, and workers and peasants. The inaugural meeting was held here today, passing various anti-British resolutions and requesting the "Beiping Provisional Government" to implement them. All movie theaters must screen anti-British cartoons before the start of the show. The cars of the British Embassy and other British people no longer display the British flag. At the same time, the Japanese also have an organization called the "Salvation Army" that sends letters to the servants of British expatriates, urging them to resign quickly, or they will be put to death.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Raid Leizhou Twice</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th of this month, the Japanese Air Force aviation unit raided Leizhou (Haikang), the main city of the Leizhou Peninsula, twice at 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM. (Domei News Agency, 20th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Aircraft Fly to Yuncheng to Drop Bombs</h3>
<p>On the 13th, the Chinese Air Force flew over Yuncheng and dropped many bombs, then returned safely. The Japanese in Yuncheng are now very panicked and have been holding air defense exercises for days, preventing Chinese aircraft from attacking again. (18th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wartime Guilin Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Chongqing, according to a telegram from Guilin, the capital of Guangxi Province, the area has drafted a "Wartime Construction Plan" and requested the National Government and the Guangxi Provincial Government to allocate one million yuan to build a new Guilin. Since the capital of Guangxi Province moved from Nanning to Guilin in 1937, all government agencies have been makeshift and temporary in nature. After the outbreak of the war, Guilin suffered repeated indiscriminate bombings by Japanese aircraft, and most of the buildings were destroyed. The current wartime construction plan drafted by the province is to build "scattered buildings" in the suburbs of Guilin to avoid major losses during bombing. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Regarding the Tianjin Four Chinese Cases, Writ of Habeas Corpus Granted by British Supreme Court</h3>
<p>London, Justice Cassels of the Supreme Court granted yesterday the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus regarding the four suspects in Tianjin, which will be returned for rehearing next Tuesday. At that time, the propriety of this application will be argued in the judge's office, and then it will be decided whether the writ should be issued. The petitioner will be represented by Sir Monckton, Attorney General of the Duchy of Cornwall, and the Crown will be represented by Sir Somerwell, Attorney General. According to this ancient British legal procedure to protect the freedom of the people, once the writ is returned, the propriety of the application will be debated, and then it will be decided whether the writ of habeas corpus should be granted. If the petitioner obtains this writ, it will instruct the person detaining the prisoner to hand over the prisoner to the British court or release him. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>A Brave Warrior of the New Fourth Army</h3>
<p>Fights Seven Japanese Soldiers Alone, Suzhou Correspondent, several New Fourth Army soldiers arrived in Donggangjing, the border between Suzhou and Changshu, a few days ago. When they were about to set off for another place, a soldier named Wang was ill and unable to set off with them, so he stayed in the area to recuperate. He was then reported to the Changshu Japanese military headquarters by a local. After receiving the report, the Japanese army dispatched seven soldiers to surround and capture him. Fortunately, Wang's actions were extremely secretive. When the Japanese army arrived at Donggang, he had already left the place. The Japanese army searched fruitlessly, so they searched nearby. Unexpectedly, Wang had hidden in advance behind a tomb west of the town. Seeing the arrival of the Japanese army, he fired first. The Japanese army was caught off guard and immediately fought back. After less than fifteen minutes of fighting, Wang, taking advantage of the terrain, killed two Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers became more panicked and fled with the bodies. Wang, with one person fighting seven Japanese soldiers, can be called brave.</p>

<h3>Britain's Attitude Towards Japan is Firm, Policy Closer to U.S.; Japanese Anti-British Movement Unrestrained, Likely Forcing Britain to Abolish Trade Treaty</h3>
<p>Paris, the French semi-official newspaper "Paris Soir" today suggested convening a conference of relevant countries to resolve the Far Eastern economic problem. The newspaper supported the British action in Tianjin and said that Japan has consistently refused to consider the conference method. However, if there is sincerity in avoiding the danger of conflict, the conference is indeed the only way to clarify the situation. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington, State Department officials here believe that Britain's hardening attitude towards Japan may be a sign that British aid to China has become more active than before. International experts here believe that the British claim that the silver issue and the circulation of legal tender must be agreed upon by other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty is extremely justified and sufficient. However, among the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, except for Italy, all oppose Japan, so it is highly doubtful that Japan will agree to the convocation of a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>London, Foreign Secretary Halifax had just returned to Beijing on official business a few days ago and returned to his Yorkshire villa for vacation two days later. However, he suddenly came to London again today. A diplomatic problem reporter for the Sunday Dispatch recently commented on this matter, saying, "News from Tokyo claims that the negotiations between Britain and Japan have broken down. It is noteworthy that the Foreign Secretary returned to Beijing at this time. It is reported that the Tokyo negotiations were 'suspended' by the Japanese representative Kato. After discussing with the Army and Foreign Ministry authorities for several hours, he met with British Ambassador Sir Craigie and informed him of this intention. Diplomatic circles here originally thought that European countries are now conducting a 'war of nerves,' and Britain's attitude in the Far East may be weakened as a result. In fact, Britain is dealing with Japan with a firm attitude, which is fortunate for the diplomatic community." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>London, Britain adopted a new tough attitude towards Japan, which was endorsed by the British press yesterday, even by those newspapers that usually advocate appeasement in the East. According to people close to the Japanese Embassy in London last night, if the anti-British movement in China becomes more intense, Britain intends to abolish the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce as retaliation. Neutral observers believe that the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce is another indication of Britain's tough attitude towards Japan. Britain's adoption of this attitude is clearly an effort to make British and American policies in the Far East more harmonious. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>North China Japanese Army to Take Independent Action to Deal with Situation After Breakdown of Negotiations</p>
<p>Tokyo, according to Japanese semi-official sources, General Sugiyama, commander of the North China Japanese Army, conferred with various commanders today and decided to take effective plans to deal with the situation arising from the actual breakdown of the talks in Tokyo. The North China Japanese military authorities will take independent action to eliminate the "enemies" among the British authorities in China. It is reported that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin are now considering submitting a time-limited telegram to the British authorities regarding the Japanese financial demands in Tianjin, which includes handing over the Chinese silver deposits in the British Concession in Tianjin and prohibiting the circulation of Chinese legal tender. All sectors of the Japanese public feel that the complete breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese talks is imminent. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Germany Does Not Eagerly Hope that Japan Joins Military Alliance</h3>
<p>Fearing it Will Facilitate the Alliance of Britain, France and the Soviet Union, Contrary to Italy's Views</p>
<p>London, news here today that Germany does not eagerly hope that Japan joins the Italo-German military alliance. Although Italian Foreign Minister Ciano welcomed Japan's joining the military alliance, it is said that Germany fears that Japan's joining the alliance will increase the possibility of the Soviet Union signing a military alliance with Britain and France. It is reported that German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop opposed Ciano's proposal to urge Japan to join the Axis powers' military alliance when they met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Salzburg and Berchtesgaden. Italy supports Japan's joining the alliance because Italy hopes to weaken Britain's naval position in the Mediterranean. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japan Poisons China; Opium Mostly Comes from Persia</h3>
<p>Washington, according to Anslinger, director of the U.S. Narcotics Bureau, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, opium production in China has been greatly reduced. In fact, no Chinese opium has been imported into the United States. As for the opium in the occupied areas of China, it is now mostly purchased by the Japanese from Persia and resold to Chinese for consumption, making huge profits. According to statistics, 3,300 boxes of opium were imported through Macau into mainland China last year. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Asian Fleet Strengthens Its Power; Six Submarines to Be Replaced with New Ones</h3>
<p>Washington, according to responsible sources, six of the U.S. Asian Fleet's 800-ton submarines are of outdated construction, and the Navy Department plans to recall them next spring and replace them with six new 1,300-ton submarines. However, this does not mean that the U.S. Asian Fleet is being strengthened, as the older submarines in the U.S. Panama Canal Zone are also often replaced with new submarines. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Manila, it is reported in naval circles here that the United States will send one battleship, several destroyers, and a submarine squadron to the Far East to join the existing Asian Fleet, while recalling several old ships to the country to improve their armament. (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<h3>Canada Promotes Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement</h3>
<p>Toronto, the Toronto City Council in Canada will pass an order next week instructing all departments of the city to purchase goods produced in the city to boycott Japanese goods.

<h3>German Military Aircraft Forced to Land in French Territory</h3>
<p>Verdun, France, a German military aircraft landed at 5:30 PM yesterday two kilometers from Montfaucon near here. Soldiers from the 155th Regiment of the Army stationed at the Verdun Fortress saw it and immediately arrested the German pilot and escorted him here to report to the superior officer. The pilot, named Heiner, claimed that he intended to fly from Hanover, Germany, to Wiesbaden, but lost his way and ran out of fuel, so he had to land. (Havas, 20th)</p>

The German theory that Hungary is included in their living space cannot be accepted. We have other valuable friendly nations besides Germany, whose interests are connected with ours." (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital City, Fekehart of the Hungarian Agrarian Party said in a speech to the party yesterday that we should not favor either Germany, Italy, or Poland, and should maintain friendship with the three countries. In the unfortunate event that war breaks out between Germany and Poland, we should not be involved in it under any circumstances. Since March 15, Germany has clearly attempted to drag all of Central Europe into its so-called German "living space." I dare to say on behalf of the Hungarians that Hungarians will not participate. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky flew from here to northern Italy today, not back to the Hungarian capital. He will stay in northern Italy for a short period of time and may leave the country on Monday. His conversation with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last night was extremely secretive. However, judging from the Italian side, the main event discussed was nothing more than Germany exerting pressure on Hungary, which Italy has been assisting. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome, it is rumored that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop again in the shortest possible time, and then return to Rome to hold talks with Italian authorities. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital City, well-informed sources here recently declared that Foreign Minister Csáky has left Italy for home and arrived in Graz this evening. He may return to the Hungarian capital tonight or tomorrow, but this information has not been confirmed. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Spain is Willing to Maintain Neutrality, Military Representatives Arrive in Rome</h3>
<p>Madrid, Spain's foreign policy has not been officially announced since the end of the civil war, but judging from the current situation, Spain seems determined to avoid being drawn into the vortex of the European war. General Franco and other leaders have expressed their willingness to adopt a neutral construction policy. Madrid's important newspaper ABC reported that Spain has no ambition for adventure or aggression. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid, the post of Commander of the Gibraltar Garrison, which was abolished by the Republican government, has now been decided to be restored by General Franco. Military circles here have interpreted it as not being opposed to Britain or to the country's occupation of the Port of Gibraltar. The area under the jurisdiction of the Garrison Commander is limited to the border between the Spanish mainland and British Gibraltar, and his duties are not mainly military, but focus on banning smuggling, especially the smuggling of tobacco and alcohol. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome, a Spanish military delegation, led by General Triano, former commander of the Second Military Region, arrived here this afternoon. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>de Valera to Visit the U.S. Next Month</h3>
<p>Washington, the Legation of the Irish Free State here recently announced that de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, is scheduled to come to the United States on the "Washington" on September 23, arriving in New York on September 28, and will come to Washington to visit President Roosevelt, and then visit the expositions in New York and San Francisco, and will attend a speech by the Irish Association in Chicago on October 2.

<h3>The Crisis in Danzig is Urgent; the Key to War and Peace Can Be Decided at the End of the Month; Diplomatic Contacts Between Countries are Very Busy; Hitler Again Advocates Direct Negotiations; Britain's Policy Decided to Prepare for Any Eventuality</h3>
<p>London, according to the diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times, the cabinet will not make new decisions at the meeting on the 22nd of this month. Similar to the crisis last year, it is now beginning again. The British government's actions today will be different from last year, which is very clear. Last year, important policies were hastily decided when the overall situation developed. Today, there are already resolutions in place to deal with all emergencies. One of the most disturbing points in the overall situation is that German newspapers are now demanding the unconditional surrender of Danzig, which makes it difficult for Germany to retreat without losing face. Today, it is generally believed that the crisis will reach its peak before the Nuremberg Congress convenes on September 2. Hitler's speech in Tannenberg on August 27 may decide the issue of war and peace. It is now hoped that Hitler will be fully aware that Britain and France have decided to fulfill the guarantees they have made to Poland. Germany only considers that 80% of this is possible. Recently, those around Hitler mistakenly believed that before Britain and France could make any impression on Germany's western border, Germany would be able to destroy Poland. Thus, Germany could conduct a separate peace with the democratic countries. However, the formal Anglo-Polish alliance treaty currently under negotiation stipulates that Britain must not conduct a separate peace or truce with Germany, which can serve as an answer to the above arguments. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London, Foreign Secretary Halifax, who was originally on vacation in York, suddenly returned to Beijing this afternoon and immediately reviewed the reports of ambassadors stationed abroad, and paid attention to the report on the talks between British Ambassador Henderson and German Foreign Minister Weizsäcker. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin, according to reliable sources, leader Hitler recently met with Italian Ambassador Attolico and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at Berchtesgaden. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had previously proposed several suggestions and plans when he was talking with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Salzburg. As soon as Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome, Ambassador Codorico was summoned back to the country to report on his duties, and arrived in Munich only yesterday. He probably carried the Italian government's answer. However, the German official refused to express his opinion on this matter, insisting that he knew nothing. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Munich, it is generally believed that Italian Ambassador Adoshago has now set off for Rome to report to Mussolini. It is rumored that Mr. Ado had an audience with Hitler to convey Italy's reply to the questions raised by the German side during the meeting of the German and Italian foreign ministers in Salzburg. It is said that this reply is quite unfavorable. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome, the outcome of the Danzig issue became more pessimistic at the end of this week. It is generally believed that Italy supports holding a conference to resolve the outstanding issues, so that a solution guaranteed by the four major powers can be obtained, and the turmoil can never be repeated. However, Germany and Poland do not believe in holding a conference, fearing that the conference will not satisfy them and will only damage their dignity. It is believed that Hitler made it clear to Ciano when he met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Salzburg that he could not accept a compromise solution, and that only direct negotiations between Germany and Poland could be beneficial. After Danzig is incorporated into Germany, Germany may not seek to provoke Poland again. However, fascist circles also have no illusions about the democratic countries' decision to oppose the invasion by force. It can also be seen from the consultations between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and military leaders that Italy is preparing for the outbreak of war. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris, French Ambassador to Italy Ponsot returned to Rome today after discussing with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet. He will visit Italian Foreign Minister Ciano on Monday. There is a rumor in Paris that Ponsot carried special documents to transfer to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, but reliable sources said that this statement has no basis. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Danzig Increase Military Preparations</h3>
<p>London: According to diplomatic sources, there are 400,000 people gathered between the Polish Corridor, Frankfurt, and Utrecht (US Associated Press, 20th).</p>
<p>Berlin: Saxony Province, near the northwestern border of German protectorates, is scheduled to hold large-scale mechanized troop exercises from September 10th to 18th. Roads in various towns reserved for army transport will now warn the public not to use them. Commercial conferences originally scheduled during this period have received advice to postpone or advance their dates (Reuters, 20th).</p>
<p>Berlin: Local newspapers recently reported that the German army will hold autumn exercises, and all highways leading to Bohemia and Moravia must be fully utilized by the army. All other people must obtain permission from the authorities to pass through them (Havas, 20th).</p>
<p>Berlin: Germany's recent military preparations are on a grand scale, and newspapers continue to fiercely attack Poland, but it seems that no immediate action has been decided. Rumors say that the Tannenberg memorial ceremony on August 27th has been canceled, and the annual Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress in September is also not planned to be held. However, the relevant authorities deny this, saying that the Tannenberg memorial ceremony has been prepared, and the speech by Führer Hitler will be broadcast everywhere by radio. Preparations for the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress have also begun, and invitations have been sent to foreign dignitaries. There is no cancellation or postponement of the above two events. Political figures also deny the rumors, saying that if the Nuremberg Congress is indeed canceled, it would be extremely serious (Havas, 19th).</p>
<p>Danzig: The authorities are now actively making military preparations. Trenches have been dug and barbed wire installed at the border between the city and Poland. Airfields and important strongholds near the city seem to have been equipped with anti-aircraft guns (Havas, 19th).</p>
<p>Danzig: The Deputy Speaker of the Danzig City Council presided over the inauguration ceremony of the new bridge in East Prussia yesterday. The bridge occupies an important position militarily. In his speech at the inauguration ceremony, the Deputy Speaker said that since 1920, Danzig has always been respectful and loving to Germany and its compatriots. Now, an invisible monument has been deeply engraved on this new bridge, with the inscription, "We eagerly hope to return to the motherland." This is clearly seen by the people of Danzig (US Associated Press, 20th).</p>
<h3>Italian Press Ridicules Poland for Negotiating with Germany</h3>
<p>Rome: Local newspapers commenting on the European situation all say that the tension has reached its peak, and it is hoped that Poland can directly reach an agreement with Germany. The headlines they use either say, "The Danzig issue is enough to directly cause war," or "The European situation is increasingly tense," or "The seriousness and acuteness of the Danzig issue has reached its peak. If a solution is not sought quickly, it will fall into an irreversible situation." The Roman People's Daily reported, "The influence exerted on Poland by Britain and France is not without deception. For the sake of Poland, it should quickly get rid of it, and approach its western neighbors frankly and publicly, and establish an understanding with them in a spirit of loyalty and friendship. Only in this way can war be avoided. It is difficult to predict the outcome once a war starts." A journalist, Gaeda (known as Mussolini's spokesperson), published an article in the Italian People's Voice, stating, "A decisive period is approaching. The tension caused by the issues of the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor should not be allowed to drag on. Poland must decide whether it wants to use violence or reason." As it stands now, Poland should abandon Britain and France and not cooperate with them, but, based on the speech made by Führer Hitler on April 28th, re-negotiate with the German government on the issues of Danzig and the Polish Corridor. This, even if done at the last minute, is not too late. If it is resolute, then the issue constituted by the power of the German nation can be resolved, and Poland's independence can be guaranteed. That is, its rights to freedom and survival, as well as its great status that is budding, can also be respected. Wouldn't that be great? Time is pressing, and Poland needs to make a decision urgently. Otherwise, I fear it will be too late in a few days (Havas, 21st).</p>
<h3>Polish僑민 in the US Pledge to Defend the Motherland</h3>
<p>New York: Polish僑民 in the United States have recently sent a telegram to the President of Poland, Mościcki, stating that there are 5 million Polish僑民 in the United States, all of whom are prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend the independence of their motherland (Havas, 19th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Christians Advise Hitler to Read the Bible</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland: A local newspaper reported that a certain important Japanese figure recently traveled to Germany to investigate the situation of Christian churches. Afterwards, some Japanese Christians sent a Bible to Führer Hitler, with a letter attached, requesting him to read the Bible carefully, so as to clearly understand the mission of Christianity and no longer persecute German Christians. The Japanese government heard about this matter too late to prevent it in advance, but it has revoked the passport of this important figure so that he cannot go abroad again to conduct investigations (Havas, 19th).</p>
<h3>The European Situation is Serious: British Cabinet Members Return to London</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to depart from Scotland this afternoon and arrive in London early tomorrow morning to preside over Tuesday's cabinet meeting. According to Reuters, Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, who is currently on vacation in Cannes, has departed today and will arrive here tomorrow, and will also attend the cabinet meeting. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax returned to his home in Yorkshire this morning and is scheduled to depart for London tonight (Reuters, 20th).</p>
<p>London: Although all departments appear to be extremely calm on the surface, they are very active internally. The sound of typewriters is incessant. Colonial Secretary MacDonald arrived at his department at 11:00 AM to work. Prime Minister Chamberlain is also scheduled to return to London from Scotland this afternoon and arrive here tomorrow morning. He will convene a cabinet meeting on the 22nd. Foreign Secretary Halifax returned to his country villa this morning and will return to London in the afternoon or evening (Havas, 20th).</p>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Halifax's sudden return to London today has surprised many. Government officials commenting on this matter said that regarding the Danzig issue, Britain is now determined to fulfill all its commitments and prepare for all eventualities. Any actions involving mediation are resolutely rejected. After Sir Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, met with German State Secretary Weizsäcker yesterday, the report he submitted has been conveyed to the Polish government by the government. At that time, Weizsäcker attacked Poland extremely fiercely, and Ambassador Henderson immediately replied in a firm tone, stating that the British government is determined to fulfill all its commitments. This is the same as the attitude expressed by French Ambassador to Germany Coulondre to State Secretary Weizsäcker on the 15th of this month. As for whether Germany is still just engaging in intimidation or will act recklessly regardless of everything, it is difficult to determine at this time. However, according to recent intelligence from Germany, the country may launch an attack at any moment, and Britain should prepare everything to deal with it. According to reliable sources, Romania has once again stated that it maintains a relationship of solidarity with all democratic countries and has also stated that if Germany attacks Romania, it will destroy all oil mines to prevent them from being used by the enemy. This is taken very seriously here (Havas, 19th).</p>
<p>London: Britain's attitude towards the European situation is extremely firm, as can be seen from the comments of various newspapers. The foreign affairs correspondent of the Sunday Times declared, "Foreign Secretary Halifax, who was originally on vacation at his villa in Yorkshire, suddenly returned to London due to the increasingly serious European situation... Britain's position is very clear at this time and does not need to make new resolutions. In short, it is welcome for Germany and Poland to conduct direct negotiations, but if Poland goes to war with Germany, then Britain and France should help Poland. Military plans have already been drawn up and will take effect immediately, with no room for further delay." The political affairs correspondent of the Sunday Times also said, "If there is any further violence, similar to that inflicted by Germany on Czechoslovakia and by Italy on Albania, then Britain will definitely join the war." The Sunday Express reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to return to London from Scotland tomorrow evening and hold meetings with Foreign Secretary Halifax, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, and Secretary of State for Home Affairs Hoare. At that time, the ministers of the three departments of the navy, army, and air force may also attend. It is heard that the result of the meeting will be the issuance of various orders to prepare in a timely manner and deal with everything in the coming weeks. "In addition, the mutual assistance agreement between Britain and Poland and the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey can be signed and established within days. The British government will send new instructions by telegram to Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, instructing him to step up negotiations and ensure that the political agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is established as soon as possible. As for Hungary, there is now talk of joining the alliance treaty between Germany and Italy. "Even if Germany obtains Hungary's consent to send troops into Hungary and use Hungary as a military base, if Poland believes that its independence is threatened, then Britain and France should implement their guarantee obligations and provide Poland with assistance (Havas, 19th).</p>
<h3>French People are Not Anxious</h3>
<p>Paris: Informed sources here recently commented on the European situation, saying, "The political truce" has ended in the past week. Political figures said that although the general public knows that the situation is serious, they do not have anxious or fearful thoughts. All newspapers, including the far right and far left, which usually attack the government, are now unanimously praising the firm attitude of Britain and France. In addition, the general public knows that Germany's goal is not only to annex the Free City of Danzig but also to raise the entire eastern border issue for that country, and even to destroy Poland (Havas, 20th).</p>
<h3>German Finance Minister Goes to Rome</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Finance Minister Krosigk left here last night for Rome and Florence, where he will stay for a few days. The purpose of this trip has not been ascertained, but senior officials of the Ministry of Finance, Dr. Schult and Dr. Gaylhoffer of the German Central Bank, are traveling with him, so there must be important matters to discuss (Haitong, 20th).</p>
<h3>Military Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Turkey</h3>
<p>London: According to diplomatic sources, Turkey has agreed with the Soviet Union that once Turkey is attacked, Soviet land and air forces can enter Turkish territory, and at the same time, the Soviet navy can pass through the Dardanelles Strait (US Associated Press, 20th).</p>
<h3>Egyptian Military Representative Visits Turkey</h3>
<p>Istanbul: An Egyptian military mission, led by General El-Azizi, arrived here today and was warmly welcomed. The mission will go to Ankara to consult with Turkish army leaders, study the Turkish military organization, and attend the final scenes of the Turkish army exercises in Antalya. The large-scale exercises are currently underway and are unprecedented in Eastern Thrace. Following the visit to the Turkish capital by former Egyptian Foreign Minister Ishia, the Egyptian military mission has now followed closely to hold military talks. Political circles here believe that this is of great significance. Commentators here say that Turkey and Egypt have joined the peace front and mutual assistance system and will join forces with Britain and France to act together as guardians of the Mediterranean (Reuters, 19th).</p>
<h3>US Observes No Immediate Change</h3>
<p>New York: The major newspapers here are commenting on the European situation. Although they say the situation is becoming increasingly critical, the tone is still calm, which is quite different from the anxious situation in September last year when the Sudetenland issue caused a crisis. A Washington correspondent for the Republican New York Tribune reported that members of Congress and political figures are not overly anxious, and most cabinet members have gone on vacation. President Roosevelt is fishing off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, and Secretary of State Hull is on vacation somewhere in California, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau is traveling in Europe in a private capacity. All of this proves that the European situation is unlikely to change drastically. The Democratic New York Times reported, "It is commendable that the democratic countries can deal with the aggressor countries with a firm and calm attitude. This calm and courageous attitude of the countries that maintain peace is the most powerful factor in upholding justice. These countries have already won a victory in the 'war of nerves'," (Havas, 19th).</p>
<h3>Southern Premier Encourages National Unity</h3>
<p>Southern Capital: Yugoslav Premier Cvetković spoke today at the Zebrnjak battlefield during the 15th anniversary of the Serbian military victory, urging all Yugoslav people to unite to ensure that the country has the ability to resist foreign aggression. The Prime Minister, after recalling the battle in Zebrnjak where a small number of Serbian troops defeated an enemy force with better equipment and a larger number, encouraged the people to always strive and not be unworthy of the heroes of Zebrnjak (Reuters, 20th).</p>
<h3>US Express Train Derails Again</h3>
<p>Chatsworth, New Jersey: The "Blue Comet" special express train traveling between New York City and Atlantic City derailed suddenly near here this afternoon, with approximately one hundred people killed or injured (Havas, 19th).</p>
<h3>US Opinion Poll: 75% Support Aiding Democratic Countries</h3>
<p>New York: According to an opinion poll, if Britain and France go to war with Germany and Italy, the United States may not be able to stay out of it. 76% of Americans hold this view. As for how the United States should help European democratic countries, opinions vary. 25% support sending troops to Europe to participate in the war, and 40% support the United States only supplying arms to democratic countries (Havas, 19th).</p>

<h3>The Abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty Endangers Japan's Entire Foreign Trade Structure</h3>
<p>The current issue of Millard's Review publishes an article by John Ahlers, discussing the impact of the United States' abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty on Japan. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>The great shock suffered by the Japanese due to the US government's notification of the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty seems to have subsided slightly on the surface. The Japanese authorities seem to have ordered the newspapers to feign a rather optimistic view of the overall situation and to encourage the Japanese people to believe that the US's actions will not have an excessively serious impact on Japan and its adventurous warfare in China. Although the Japanese people have been appeased and have a false sense of security, the vast Japanese business community is still filled with fear.</p>
<p>As soon as the news of the abolition was announced, raw silk prices in Yokohama and Kobe plummeted, and trading in futures silk was particularly difficult. Raw silk accounts for one-third of all Japanese exports to the United States, and almost eighty percent of Japanese raw silk exports go to the United States. Japanese porcelain manufacturers are also greatly disturbed because the United States is also their most important export market. The Osaka cotton industry anticipates danger for its cotton textile exports to the United States and the Philippines. Other Japanese business circles have also expressed great concern about this matter. Cotton can be purchased from British India and Brazil, and unrefined kerosene can be supplied from the Dutch East Indies and Mexico, but many of the machines used in Japanese industry rely entirely on special machine oil from the United States to operate smoothly. This can only be purchased from the United States. Much of the expansion of Japan's war industries also relies on the continuous supply of metal machinery from the United States. Certain high-speed steel that Japan urgently needs can only be manufactured by the United States, and the scrap iron and steel needed by Japan also has the United States as the most important source.</p>
<p>The treaty is still in effect until January 26, 1940, more than five months from now, but it is difficult for Japan to make huge forward extra transactions in advance to avoid the various impacts after the treaty expires. The supply of raw silk is currently severely restricted. The amount of raw silk stored in Japan is not enough for even one month's exports to the United States, so it is impossible to store large amounts of raw silk in New York. In other respects, the shortage of foreign exchange prevents Japan from purchasing and storing large quantities of extra US machine oil, metal machinery, and scrap iron. Even if Japan attempts to make small-scale purchases and storage, it is feared that it will be difficult to succeed due to the US Department of Commerce's determination to oppose it.</p>
<p>The importance of Japan's commercial relationship with the United States can be seen at a glance from Japanese trade statistics. In the first five months of this year, of the goods exported by Japan worth 115.8 million yen, those transported to the United States accounted for 16.6 million yen. However, almost half of Japan's total exports go to countries in the Yen Bloc and cannot generate foreign exchange. Exports to other countries are only worth 59.7 million yen, with the United States accounting for 27.7% of this number. If we include Japan's exports to the Philippines and Hawaii, the percentage of the United States in Japan's exports increases to 30%. Even more noteworthy is the position of the United States in Japan's import trade. In the first five months of this year, Japan imported goods worth 121.36 million yen, of which 28.76 million yen came from other countries in the Yen Bloc. Imports from countries outside the Yen Bloc amounted to 92.6 million yen, of which 42.52 million yen came from the United States, accounting for 46% of Japan's imports from non-Yen Bloc countries. Including the Philippines and Hawaii, the figure reaches 48%. Two-thirds of all military supplies imported by Japan come from the United States, and for some of them, Japan can only import them with the goodwill of the United States.</p>
<p>After the current US-Japan Commercial Treaty expires, what changes will there be in this trade? It is difficult for Japan to induce the US government to conclude another treaty with it in a timely manner. Recently, the Japanese side investigated the seriousness of this possibility, and the results are quite disheartening to the Japanese. Therefore, Tokyo may not even make a proposal to negotiate another treaty. Therefore, from January 26 next year, there may be a situation of no treaty between the US and Japan, and both countries have complete freedom to treat each other's trade at will. Japanese goods in the United States will lose the benefit of the most-favored-nation clause in the current treaty and will have to pay the highest import duties. The United States, in view of the Japanese government's current subsidies for the production of export goods (such as silk) or the export goods themselves (such as porcelain), may cause Japan to pay special punitive taxes in addition to the highest import duties. Japan's suicide competition with the United States' high-value labor using low-value labor is another motive for punishing Japanese goods entering the United States. According to reliable estimates, the wages lost by American workers are ten times the value of Japanese goods imported into the United States because such goods, if not imported, must be manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p>Raw silk, which accounts for the majority of Japan's exports to the United States, is indeed in grave danger. Today, the United States still relies heavily on Japanese raw silk to manufacture silk stockings, but when the treaty expires, two new factories of DuPont Nemours, which can be completed early next year, will begin large-scale manufacturing of new American hosiery silk substitutes, called "Nylon". Japan's hope of maintaining itself against Nylon has been greatly reduced due to the abolition of the treaty. Japan can certainly retaliate to some extent and prohibit the import of all US goods that are not absolutely necessary, but the number of these goods is small and they account for a small portion of US exports to Japan because Japan's current trade and foreign exchange control systems have already reduced these US exports to a minimum. If Japan imposes punitive taxes on US cotton, kerosene, machinery, and scrap iron, Japan itself will have to pay these additional taxes.</p>
<p>What the Japanese fear most about the abolition of the treaty is that the United States may no longer be prepared to sell raw materials, kerosene, metal machinery, airplanes, and various other military supplies to them. The US government has clearly made up its mind about this action and can stop the export of certain items to Japan, not only by revising the US Neutrality Act or passing Senator Pittman's proposal to embargo arms to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty. President Roosevelt and his government have various other ways to achieve this goal. This policy may not even require formal approval from Congress. The recent ban on the export of US airplanes to Japan, due to the strong insistence of the US State Department, shows what kind of actions it can take.</p>
<p>If we ask why Washington has not yet taken these measures, then it must be understood that the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is an almost insurmountable obstacle to these procedures. Article 5 of the treaty clearly stipulates that any commodity of either contracting party cannot be prohibited from being exported to the other contracting party unless its export to other countries is prohibited. This obstacle will be eliminated when the treaty expires. After that, Japan's position will no longer be able to protest the US's export ban with the force of mutual obligation.</p>
<p>Japan is a country that relies entirely on overseas commerce. The abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty has caused Japan to encounter the most difficult foreign trade problems it has experienced in modern times. The commerce of Japan with countries that generate foreign exchange is endangered by no less than one-third, and Japan's most important source of foreign military supplies may be cut off due to the abolition of the treaty. Furthermore, Japan also faces the danger of not obtaining understanding with Britain, and the British government may follow Washington's lead. Britain also accounts for a quarter of Japan's trade with foreign countries outside the Yen Bloc, so almost sixty percent of Japan's trade is transacted with the two Anglo-Saxon countries. The positions of Germany and Italy are not able to replace the Anglo-Saxon countries to a noteworthy degree in Japanese commerce. Manchuria and the areas occupied by the Japanese army in mainland China will not be directly affected by the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. We will wait and see in the future. The United States does not have a commercial treaty with "Manchukuo." The United States has not recognized the Changchun puppet regime, but there is a commercial treaty between China and the United States, and in the Japanese-controlled areas, this treaty has suffered large-scale interference from the Japanese side for a long time. It is possible that the United States will no longer tolerate this interference. For example, the products of North China are now subject to foreign exchange control by the semi-official Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank. The US authorities can easily refuse to issue export certificates for North China products. If the Japanese are cut off and cannot freely obtain certain weapons and other supplies from the United States, they will of course seek to obtain them through various indirect routes. They will try to import these American goods into China, within their new sphere of influence, allowing them to indirectly purchase through Shanghai what they can no longer purchase directly from the United States. The US authorities in this port will have to carefully monitor the market in this port to prevent this kind of abuse of the strong trading position of the United States in Shanghai. Although Shanghai has been a great help to the Japanese for many years, this city should not become an active base for plotting to undermine the intentions of US trade policy.</p>
<h3>The Seriousness of Infectious Diseases in Fujian Province: Malaria Spreads Throughout the Province, Plague Becomes Increasingly Rampant</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the War of Resistance, the people of Fujian Province, especially those along the coast, have moved inland together. Consequently, their lifestyles have suddenly changed, inevitably affecting their physical health. Various diseases have taken the opportunity to occur, among which malaria, meningitis, and plague are the most prevalent. According to statistics from the Provincial Health Department, the areas where malaria is prevalent cover all counties in the province, with no fewer than four million sufferers, reaching one-third of the total population. If each person needs fifty quinine pills to be completely cured, a total of two hundred million quinine pills are needed. The amount of quinine pills currently stored by public and private sectors is no longer plentiful. If sufferers want to seek treatment, they may be unable to find medicine. As for the plague in more than twenty counties along the southeastern coast and inland western Fujian, due to the lack of medical institutions and medicines, the epidemic is becoming increasingly rampant. In Yongchun, Hui'an, Longyan, Liancheng, Putian, Xianyou, and other counties, there are countless deaths, and coffins in urban and rural areas are sold out. Some people even simply bury the dead due to the inability to purchase coffins. Furthermore, meningitis, which has spread to thirty counties from last autumn to this spring, accounts for half of the province. The extent of the epidemic area is unprecedented in the history of infectious diseases. The Provincial Health Department has set up isolation wards and quarantine stations in key locations to accommodate patients and ordered the health bureaus of various counties to make every effort to prevent the spread. By mid-May, the epidemic had gradually been suppressed. In addition, there is also a disease called hydrocele, which has been found in more than ten counties along the eastern coast of Fujian. As many as forty-two percent of the young and middle-aged people suffer from this disease, which is quite alarming. After inspection by the Provincial Health Department, it was found that it is caused by mosquitoes. The mosquitoes carry a kind of filarial worm. When mosquitoes suck human blood, they transmit the worms into the human body. After maturation, they block the lymphatic system, resulting in this disease. In summary, these four diseases are indeed serious and pressing problems for the health of the people of Fujian Province. However, due to the lack of medicine, they cannot be prevented and treated. Moreover, such a large-scale disease is beyond the capacity of the limited manpower and financial resources of the local government. Therefore, the authorities of Fujian Province hope that domestic and foreign health and charitable organizations, as well as overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, will raise donations or donate large quantities of medicine for widespread treatment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Expand Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese troops have been holding "Expanded Anti-British Movement Propaganda Week" in various cities in northern Jiangsu.

According to the two-year plan, the Southwest Border Education Inspection Group should be organized first this year to conduct inspections in the border areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces.

Now the group has been fully prepared, divided into three groups. The first group is education, with members Guo Lianfeng (educational administration), Zong Liangdong (educational psychology and testing), Ge Yiqing (comparative language), and assistant Huang Ju'an. The second group is society, with members Zhao Chunxiao and assistant Wang Jianguang. The third group is natural science, with members Ni Dashu and assistant Zhang Zongzhe.

On July 22, the group held its first group affairs meeting at the Ministry of Education, with Director Gu Zhang and Director Liang attending to provide guidance, and resolved various issues such as the inspection route and various rules and regulations. On July 31, the group, led by Guo Lianfeng, arrived in Chongqing, where Minister Chen gave a speech, providing detailed instructions on the group's important tasks and the points to be noted during the inspection. The group departed by ship to Yibin on August 2, taking the route of Zhaotong and Kunming, first to Dali, Tengchong, Lijiang, and other places for inspection, and then to southeastern Yunnan for work. After completing the work in Yunnan Province, the group will enter Guangxi via Baise, conduct inspections in two routes, and gather in Guilin. Then, they will enter Guizhou via Longsheng, and conduct inspections in Huangping, Pingfan, Anshun, Dading, and other places. The estimated time is half a year.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Subsidiary Coin Problem Solved; Subsidiary Coin Notes to Be Issued Tomorrow; Chamber of Commerce Suggests Disposal Method for Stamps; Post Office Is Seriously Considering; Promissory Notes Issued by Various Companies Should Be Recalled Immediately</h3>
<p>The Central Bank, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, will issue 1-fen and 5-fen subsidiary coin notes. After the first batch of 500,000 yuan is printed, it is scheduled to be issued and circulated in Shanghai tomorrow (Tuesday). Regarding the stamps currently circulating in the market, which will become a problem, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has proposed a disposal method and suggested it to the Post Office. It is heard that the Post Office is seriously considering it. The details are as follows. The Ministry of Finance previously agreed to the request of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to issue 1-fen and 5-fen subsidiary coin notes by the Central Bank in order to alleviate the shortage of copper coins in Shanghai. The bank signed a contract with Yongning Printing Company in Hong Kong. The first batch of 500,000 yuan, including 300,000 yuan for 1-fen notes and 200,000 yuan for 5-fen notes, has been printed in accordance with the contract and will be issued by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank. The issuance method is the same as that of subsidiary coin notes. One hundred 1-fen notes or twenty 5-fen notes can be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender at the bank. The reserve is 100% legal tender.</p>
<p>Post Office Considers Disposing of Stamps</p>
<p>After the issuance of subsidiary coin notes, the stamps currently circulating in the market will become a problem. The Shanghai Post Office has received a formal letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce suggesting a disposal method: (1) All stamps that are slightly soiled due to repeated circulation should be used by the Post Office as much as possible without penalty. (2) The stamps accumulated by major companies, banks, and stores should be retained for their own mailing purposes and not be recalled. (3) The Post Office should repurchase the stamps in the hands of peddlers and rickshaw pullers at the original price to avoid losses and set a deadline for repurchase. It is heard that the Post Office is seriously considering it.</p>
<p>Promissory Notes Already Issued Should Be Recalled</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Shanghai Tram Company and various companies and firms had previously issued promissory notes to facilitate business due to the shortage of copper coins. This was a temporary emergency measure. Now that the Central Bank's subsidiary coin notes have been scheduled to be issued, the promissory notes should be recalled immediately for the sake of unifying the currency system. Various companies and firms should no longer issue promissory notes. It is also heard that the Central Bank is planning to reissue 1-fen and 5-fen aluminum coins and is currently discussing it with the Ministry of Finance.

<h3>False Police Shoot and Injure West Control Search Case; Municipal Council Lodges Protest; Content of Protest Letter Divided into Three Main Points; Will Be Sent to the Japanese Side by the Bureau Today</h3>
<p>On the 10th of this month, an "Avenue Police" and plainclothes detectives holding weapons broke into the concession near Xinkangli, Jessfield Road, Shanghai West. Kimluck (KINLOOK), a West Detective on duty patrolling in the area on the police patrol car, thought that these people did not understand the boundaries, so he went forward to explain and persuade them to withdraw. Unexpectedly, these people made things difficult and opened fire to resist arrest while the West Detective turned around to call the police, and shot at Kim, the bullet entering from the back, forming the most serious stalemate. It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council is very angry at Kim's unwarranted shooting by the "Avenue Police" and drafted a strong protest on the night of the incident. It is heard that the content of the protest lists three main points, such as the "Avenue Police" entering the Public Concession to perform their duties. The protest has been approved by senior officials and will be submitted to the Japanese side today.</p>
<p>Protest to Be Filed Today</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Municipal Council began drafting a strong protest to be submitted to the Japanese authorities last night (19th) regarding the shooting incident of trainee West Detective Yu Luke. It is heard that the protest will be based on three factors, namely, opposing the illegal activities of the "Avenue" police on the roads of the concession, the "Avenue" police obstructing the duties of a police officer of the Police Department, and Kim Luke being shot. It is heard that the protest has been approved by two bureau officials and will be submitted to the Japanese authorities today (20th). Also, the English-language Great American Evening Post said that the Municipal Council will protest to the Japanese authorities tomorrow (21st) against the "Avenue" police patrol team shooting and injuring Kim Luke, a trainee West Detective of the Public Concession Police Department, at 5:30 p.m. yesterday (19th) on Jessfield Road between Connaught Road and Carter Road. According to reports, although Kim was shot in the back, he ran into the No. 9 armored car and opened a hand-held machine gun. Subsequently, the two sides exchanged fire, killing two "Avenue" police officers and seriously injuring two others. The other three were slightly injured. Kim is currently in the hospital and is not in danger.</p>
<p>Defense Forces Discuss Security in the Western District</p>
<p>The China Press reported that the commanders of the foreign defense forces in Shanghai held a meeting yesterday afternoon (19th) to discuss the illegal incidents that occurred in the Western District. If serious shootings occur again in this troublesome area, the result may be the declaration of martial law.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Security Was Extremely Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday, the area along Jessfield Road, Brennan Road, Roberts Road, Yanping Road, Connaught Road, Jiaozhou Road, Singapore Road, Xinzha Road, Avenue Edward VII, YuYuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, etc., in Shanghai West was densely guarded by Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives and Italian garrison troops. Patrol teams shuttled back and forth. All suspicious pedestrians and vehicles were subject to inspection. Public buses on Route 1, Route 10, Route 7, Route 9, etc., which crossed into the concession to the east, were particularly strictly inspected. Red alert vehicles were also dispatched throughout the day, galloping on the roads, and the security was extremely tight. It was even worse at night. Military police and detectives were stationed on all roads.</p>
<h3>Negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese Side Regarding Free Rice Transportation to Shanghai; Business Firms Issue Letters to Prevent Hoarding; Strict Restrictions on the Resumption of Rice Market Operations</h3>
<p>Due to rampant under-the-table dealings and chaotic transactions, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market decided to suspend operations from the 18th. It is now permitted to reopen today. However, to rectify market operations, all market activities after resumption must register the owners of goods and the consignees, to ensure that transportation and sales are compliant and easy to report. Since the Shanghai rice supply problem became severe, the Shanghai Municipal Council is currently negotiating with the Japanese authorities regarding the free transportation of rice to Shanghai. They are also advising rice merchants to sell their stored rice at fair prices. The following is a record of yesterday's situation:</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Publication of Rice Inventory Survey</p>
<p>A letter from the Bean and Rice Trade Association to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council states, "Regarding the 'Rice Inventory Survey,' it began with the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee. After the committee disbanded, our association continued to handle it. All survey forms from each period have been sent to your bureau for review and record. Recently, there have been rumors from outside claiming that the inventory numbers self-reported by the rice industry may not be reliable, which is used as propaganda to mislead people. According to the scope of this survey, it is based on reports from each warehouse and limited to warehouses within the concessions. It does not include stores outside the concessions, rice stored in rice shops, or rice purchased by households. The purpose of the survey is to understand the abundance or scarcity of food for the people to assist the authorities in planning and regulating measures. This is what your bureau understands. As for the accuracy of the survey conducted by our association, we heard that your bureau also sent personnel to investigate. We now request that the results of the investigation be published to show whether the numbers match, to clarify the reality. Our association will continue to work on this matter in the future, but we will no longer publish it publicly, except for sending it to your bureau for review or direct publication by your bureau, to avoid suspicion. We hereby declare this. We hope you will consider it."</p>
<p>Letter to Taxpayers' Association to Prevent Hoarding</p>
<p>Children's Bookstore, Yu Sheng Xiang Weaving Factory, Yonghua Printing Bureau, Lianghua Printing Bureau, and others sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday, stating, "The rice price in this city is soaring endlessly, mainly due to the control in the producing areas and the manipulation by capitalists. As a model for the citizens, your association should address the public safety of all citizens with the rise and fall of rice prices. It is requested that you, representing all citizens, send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, requesting that it jointly establish a city-wide rice inventory registration office with the French Municipal Council. Rice merchants and other hoarding households should be ordered to register the actual amount of rice in storage within three days. The registered rice will be numbered by the registration office, with the last registrant being No. 1, and ordered to submit it to a temporarily designated public sales place at a limited price until it is sold out. At the same time, representatives from each neighborhood should be allowed to form a rice inventory reporting committee to search each household and nearby shops on the day after the registration period expires, to prevent anyone from escaping. If it is found that the amount of rice stored without registration is more than ten shi, or if the amount actually registered exceeds ten shi, it will be regarded as concealment. All such rice should be confiscated, with half of it used as a reward and half of it sold at a reduced price. The proceeds should be used to subsidize the needs of refugees. By doing so, we can achieve two goals. We hereby send this letter, hoping that your association will investigate and implement it. We are extremely grateful. Furthermore, please also request the Shanghai Municipal Council to find ways to dredge the source of rice supply. This is a combined request."</p>
<p>Kui Yanfang's Views on Price Stabilization</p>
<p>Kui Yanfang, Chairman of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, expressed his opinions on handling price stabilization in Shanghai to visitors yesterday, saying, "At a time when foreign exchange is shrinking sharply, residents within the concessions are already suffering greatly, and the soaring rice price is of great concern to the people's livelihood. I advocate that price stabilization is an urgent matter. However, according to reports, only 8,000 bags are being handled for price stabilization, which seems too small. The rice market has been in panic for a long time, and the people's needs are urgent. If there is a sudden relief, everyone will rush for it. If the distribution is not proper, it will inevitably affect public order. Those in charge should have a detailed plan to prevent accidents. If economic factors make it difficult to popularize, then there are many public-spirited people in the Chinese and foreign banking circles who can unite and plan together. The number of bags for price stabilization must be no less than 200,000 to 300,000 to be effective. As for the old plan proposed by Old Qia to use the tax-free surplus of more than 300,000 yuan from the tax-free foreign rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council last year for deficit compensation, I strongly agree with it. The Shanghai Municipal Council has a special responsibility to maintain local order and should not be stingy and refuse to grant it."</p>
<p>Rice Riot on Changping Road</p>
<p>Due to speculation and hoarding, the city's food supply has been soaring, making life unbearable for the people. At around 8 p.m. last night, about 500 men and women, poorly clothed and haggard, suddenly appeared in front of Ni Yixing Rice Store at No. 81 Changping Road in western Shanghai, each holding a small amount of legal tender, hoping to buy a small amount of rice to maintain their lives. At that time, the store replied that there was no rice. This aroused public indignation, believing that it was intentional difficulty. With many people talking at once, a rice riot broke out. However, the store was indeed out of rice, so only about 100 bags of flour were looted. By the time the detectives arrived, they had dispersed and arrested three men and one woman for investigation.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers Request Pay Raise; Bureau Approves Allowance</h3>
<p>Since the black market exchange rate plummeted and everything soared, the cost of living has been unprecedentedly high. Due to the difficult living conditions, the postal staff of the Shanghai Postal Administration jointly submitted a request to the postal workers' union, requesting the director Mr. Cha Peilin to approve a pay raise of several percent. After repeated consideration by Mr. Cha, it was agreed that starting from the eighth month, each postal worker from Grade B to messenger would receive a uniform allowance of 7.5 yuan per month. However, the more than 30 guards used by the bureau continued to request the same treatment to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Guild Proposes Increasing Fare by Two Cents Per Rickshaw Per Day</h3>
<p>Approval is still required from the Public Concession. Since the foreign exchange rate plummeted, the prices of goods made from foreign and foreign raw materials have all soared. The price of rubber and hardware materials used for rickshaws has also more than doubled. The Rickshaw Guild specially convened a meeting to discuss ways to increase rickshaw fares. The result was that the pre-war "small meeting" (i.e., those operating in the Nanshi and French Concession areas) fare was 55 cents per day. Later, due to the closure of Nanshi, it was changed to 40 cents. However, the cost of rickshaw materials at that time was only four or five tenths of the current cost. Now the cost of living is getting higher and higher, and the burden on rickshaw pullers and owners is also increasing. Therefore, it was decided to adjust the fare and uniformly charge 42 cents per day from the 20th to take into account the interests of both labor and management. Regarding the rickshaws in the Public Concession, because the Shanghai Municipal Council restricts rent increases, the Special Zone Rickshaw Guild is required to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council for reconsideration to allow for a discretionary increase in rickshaw fares to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Four Chinese Cases; Powers of Attorney, etc., Sent to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reuters Tianjin, 20th - American lawyer Fusi Sang here has prepared various documents related to the four Chinese suspects in the assassination of Cheng case for the Shanghai Ellis Law Firm and will mail them to Shanghai soon. Among them are powers of attorney and affidavits from the four Chinese, and copies of the arrest warrants for the four Chinese.

<h3>First Inspection Held by the Exchange Preparation Inspection Committee; Drawing Amount 14.75 Million Yuan; Total Value of Collateral 25 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association, in order to enrich the industry's business preparation and regulate industrial and commercial funds, decided to handle the exchange drawing and use matters of the industry through the Bank Joint Preparation Committee. The association started handling the exchange drawing and use by various banks and money houses from July 4. Collateral in the property specified in the drawing and use method must be submitted to the Preparation Committee as collateral.

The inspection of this collateral is carried out by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, Nong, the four banks, the Foreign Bank Association, and the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association, each sending representatives to organize the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association Exchange Inspection Committee for handling. It is also stipulated that at least one inspection should be carried out every month and an inspection announcement should be issued to show credibility.

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Will Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss the Issue of Jewish Refugees; Consuls from France and Japan Will Attend; The Location is the Shanghai Municipal Council Building</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of Jewish refugees flocking to the Shanghai Concession, the Municipal Council has always been at a loss due to lack of funds and land. In addition to French Consul Baudicci, Shanghai Municipal Council Director-General Felippe, and Japanese Consul General Miura holding consultations for days, it has also been decided to organize a board of directors, which will be responsible for organizing by French Deputy Consul General Gaitant, Jewish Refugee Society Jin Jun, Japanese Consul Itsu Garlo (transliteration), and Shanghai Municipal Council representative Naishe. It is learned that the board of directors will hold its first meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Council Building this afternoon to comprehensively discuss and resolve difficult issues.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Implements Brutal and Cruel Governance; The People in the Inland Areas Are Suffering; They Exhaust Their Ability to Extract Economically; They Arbitrarily Intimidate and Slaughter Farmers; Young People Are Forced to Undergo Military Training</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that Chinese merchants from inland towns now residing in Shanghai have investigated the situation in their hometowns and obtained news about the Japanese army consolidating its position in inland towns. These merchants are now living off their meager savings in Shanghai, so they are eager to return to the inland areas to do business again. They first studied the possibility of selling rice and found that they could buy 100 jin of rice from farmers for 5 to 7 yuan and sell it in Shanghai for 20 yuan. After deducting transportation costs, they could still make a profit of two or three times. They also sold cloth and other goods to the inland areas and made twice the profit. However, according to a merchant, he sold several shipments between a small town in the inland area and Shanghai and made a considerable profit.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Manipulates Rice Grain Trade</p>
<p>One day, he was suddenly arrested by a puppet police officer, thrown into prison, and suffered greatly. His property was confiscated, and he had to abandon his business and flee to a large city that was not noticed. Given this precedent, other small merchants engaged in similar businesses decided to stop selling. The rice grain trade was then exclusively manipulated by a group controlled by the Japanese army. Therefore, the Japanese army gained a lot because they arbitrarily demanded rice grain transported to Shanghai and other consumption centers before allowing passage.</p>
<p>Chinese Guerillas Secretly Restrict</p>
<p>This ingenious method of extraction was known to the Chinese guerrillas in the rural areas of the rice-producing areas, and they ordered that no rice should be sold to the people sent by the Japanese army. On some roads, guerrillas did not allow each person to transport more than 40 jin of rice per shipment, which was only enough to purchase the needs of their own family. This method greatly reduced the amount of rice and other products falling into the hands of the Japanese. It appears that the number of guerrillas around the Beijing-Shanghai area and other areas along the railway line is rapidly increasing, and the economic program of the Japanese army in the occupied areas is now in danger.</p>
<p>Chinese And Japanese Troops Mutual Purging</p>
<p>Also, according to a gentleman who talked about the situation in a certain city in his hometown, the Japanese army has established a puppet government in the city and is using the city as a base. Now it has begun a "purging" movement against the guerrillas in the area. Guerrillas in other areas have also begun a movement to purge the Japanese garrison and are forcing the Japanese garrison to retreat into larger cities along the railway line. Therefore, the current result seems to be definitely in favor of the guerrillas. This is largely due to the large number of guerrillas.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Arrests and Torture of Villagers</p>
<p>However, the guerrillas cannot prevent the Japanese army from repeatedly dispatching one to three hundred soldiers with machine guns and small mountain cannons, as well as three days' worth of food, to attack the towns where the guerrillas are based. When the Japanese army arrives, the guerrillas are already at a slightly farther place, looking for favorable opportunities to launch a night attack, or to annihilate sentries and small teams of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army then arrests several civilians and escorts them back to the headquarters, where they are severely tortured, forcing them to reveal information about the guerrillas active in the vicinity.</p>
<p>A Terrifying World In Human Hell</p>
<p>Both the guerrillas and the Japanese soldiers often wear plain clothes, especially when engaged in reconnaissance. Villagers often do not know who the other party is when someone points a gun at them, leading to mistaken words, and being killed or suffering. This is the chaos and terror that the Japanese army has brought into the entire occupied area. The Japanese widely posted posters in the occupied areas, calling this the "New Order in East Asia" and "East Asian Peace." The hard-working Chinese farmers live this life, no less than a human hell. They suffer and dare not tell the outside world.</p>
<p>Young People Join Guerillas</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese army has repeatedly forcibly conscripted Chinese people in the occupied areas and subjected them to large-scale training. In a certain area, the Japanese army forced men aged 18 to 25 to undergo military training. These young people, unwilling to fight against their compatriots, flocked to the guerrilla areas, and many enthusiastically registered to join the guerrillas. A certain unit suddenly increased by as many as 3,000 volunteers.</p>
<p>Changing Tactics Want To Fight The Soviet Union</p>
<p>In order to appease the fears of young people and faced with strong opposition from the puppets, the Japanese army changed its tactics and announced that young people do not have to fight against their compatriots, but will be sent to the three northeastern provinces to fight the Soviets. Because the young people have almost all fled, the Japanese army plans to forcibly conscript older men aged 25 to 30 who have not fled. The Japanese army is not yet ready to set its trap to lure these men into its net, but it has already leaked the news, so these men are also fleeing.</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Men Forced To Train</p>
<p>However, tens of thousands of those who could not escape are now being trained in Nanjing and other places. The policy adopted by the Japanese army is to keep young people as far away from their hometowns as possible, making it difficult to escape. If they try to escape, it will not be difficult to find out because of the different dialects. Because the border of the three northeastern provinces is threatened by the Soviet Union, the Japanese army is now carrying out a large-scale plan to train Chinese people to fight the Soviets. The Japanese army originally planned to train these young people when it had pacified the whole of China.</p>
<p>People In Eastern Two Provinces Forced To Come To Shanghai</p>
<p>However, because the Soviet Union did not intend to sit idly by, the Japanese army accelerated the conscription of young people in the inland areas of central China, and its implementation of the anti-communist movement was to conquer China and then use China to conquer the Soviet Union and other places. Many people from Lu Province who migrated to the three northeastern provinces have been forced by the Japanese army to come to the inland areas of Shanghai to fight against the guerrillas. How can the Japanese army make these young people quickly form an army by forcing them to train in central China, and use them to occupy vast areas and drive the white people out of Asia?</p>
<h3>Yellow Sand Is Under Unified Control; Construction Is Halted; Thousands Of Workers Are In Urgent Need Of Relief</h3>
<p>The various yellow sands needed for construction in Shanghai were purchased from Sizhou by members of the Shanghai Sand and Stone Industry Association, and then transported to Shanghai for sale by various gang transport merchants. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai environment was special, and the local products in the four suburbs were all under unified control. The Association has petitioned the concession authorities to find ways to dredge the source, but so far, the source is still scarce. As a result, the entire construction industry in Shanghai has been affected and has been declared halted and cannot be carried out. All sand and stone firms have also temporarily suspended business. However, it is hoped that the concession authorities will urgently find ways to maintain normal business so that it can continue. According to the person in charge of the industry yesterday, the capital of the members of the industry is very thin and the scale is small. Moreover, the profit from operating sand and stone is very low. Now that business is suspended, thousands of workers are suffering from unemployment, and the cost of living is high. If this continues, there will be no place to stand. The situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. It is deeply hoped that the authorities will do their best to provide relief.</p>
<h3>The Consuls Of The Consular Corps Bid Farewell To The Chilean Consul General</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that Chilean Consul General to Shanghai, Vega, has been appointed as the Counselor of the Chilean Legation in Tokyo. The consuls of the Shanghai Consular Corps hosted a banquet for Vega at the French Club on the 17th of this month and presented him with a silver cigarette case signed by all the consuls. Vega will go to Japan in mid-September after his successor, Mr. Narin, arrives in Shanghai to take office. Before his departure, there will be many private banquets to bid farewell to Vega. It is reported that Vega came to Shanghai to take office on October 7, 1935. Health Forum</p>

<h3>The Influence And Value Of Physical Beauty On Love Between Men And Women</h3>
<p>--- Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Regarding everything about physical beauty, of course, facial beauty is necessary, but the overall must also be taken into account. Now we want to promote "healthy beauty." That kind of "romantic" and "poetic" "pale-faced scholar" has lost its sense of the times, so the conditions for physical beauty are: "correct posture" and "developed muscles"; in short, the physique must be "strong and solid"! An unhealthy body will not have enough spirit, and the fun of family questioning after marriage will not be strong, and it will also affect future children, so you must pay attention to the other party's habits of sports, hygiene, entertainment, etc.</p>
<p>At the same time, we cannot deny that the foundation of marriage is love, and the driving force of love is "beauty", so it can also be said that the first condition for choosing a spouse is "beauty." But when it comes to beauty, it is easy to think of appearance, and in general, women often use "appearance" beauty as the standard for matching spouses, which is really wrong. Beauty should focus on reproductive instinct to be infinitely happy.</p>
<p>Speaking of the beauty of reproductive instinct, this is also related to physical beauty, because after the body is healthy and beautiful, the body must be healthy and disease-free, so the reproductive function is full and strong. In terms of love, this kind of man is always loved by women. In terms of fertility, the children produced by this kind of man must be excellent and strong. As for himself, he must also feel infinite happiness, full of spirit, ruddy complexion, and rich intelligence, unlike the thin ones who suffer from neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, impotence and infertility, and other reproductive power disorders. Since the combination of men and women belongs to reproduction, these problems should be treated quickly.</p>
<p>Regarding the cultivation of reproductive beauty and healthy beauty, it is best to avoid self-indulgence during development, avoid licentiousness before marriage, and avoid indulgence after marriage. If the innate is insufficient, or those who commit this due to weak will, the German genuine lift ball essence preparation for men "Bu Ti Kang" should be taken during treatment. This has a definite therapeutic value in clinical practice and is trusted by our doctors, so we dare to introduce it to patients. It is most suitable for those with incomplete development, neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, and premature ejaculation. Its female "Bu Ti Kang" has the effect of developing breast peaks, regulating menstruation, and sowing seeds, and has unparalleled effects on physical beauty.</p>

<h3>Consuming Opium is Like Borrowing Money with Usurious Interest!</h3>
<p>— (Authored by American Medical Doctor, Huang Zhongchang)</p>
<p>Our human energy is originally limited and should not be excessively used. If energy is used excessively, future energy cannot be as ample as before. We often see many people who, due to excessive fatigue during the day, feel that their energy is not sustained and often want to use temporary stimulant drugs to compensate. The most common is opium. People who smoke opium do not necessarily use it for stomachaches, heartaches, or any other pain, eventually becoming addicted. However, most of them are physically fatigued and want to use opium to stimulate themselves. It is also true that those who indulge in lascivious pleasures have to borrow the stimulant properties of opium to pre-consume tomorrow's energy in order to seek immediate gratification because their energy is depleted. This is no different from borrowing money from someone at usurious interest rates, which must be repaid with both principal and interest to the creditor in the future. Therefore, the more opium a person smokes, the more exhausted their energy becomes, and the more they need to smoke. The result will inevitably be physical and mental exhaustion. This is like debtors who accumulate a high debt platform and eventually go bankrupt, which is the same reasoning. Therefore, smoking opium is the same as borrowing money with usurious interest from a red-headed Indian.</p>
<p>"Quitting opium" is originally not an easy task, but it requires strong and effective support. The medicine "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Supplement Kang) is the greatest tonic for saving all exhausted energy.</p>
<p>Originally, smoking opium cannot increase any energy; it only invigorates energy temporarily. "Bu Ti Kang," on the other hand, is entirely made from the youth glands of strong animals. After taking it, it can promote the development of cells and accelerate the function of metabolism. All those whose cells have lost elasticity due to opium, are weakened, have reduced blood, are thin in muscle, have short energy, or have nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and kidney deficiency due to excessive sexual activity can experience special effects from taking "Bu Ti Kang." It can also enable opium smokers to automatically quit after taking "Bu Ti Kang" because "Bu Ti Kang" also contains a kind of egg yolk substance, which is of great benefit in terms of quitting smoking.</p>
<h3>The Main Points of Treating the Lungs</h3>
<p>— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>The lung is an unconscious organ, so it is unaware when it is invaded by tubercle bacilli. Even if it is eroded into a cavity, there is no specific pain. Only when tubercle bacilli attack the pleura and cause pleurisy is there a feeling of stabbing pain in the chest, or the chest cavity accumulates water due to pleurisy, or death occurs due to tuberculous meningitis. Therefore, to treat lung disease, one should pay attention to recuperation, such as air circulation and sufficient sunlight. For diet, one should especially take nutritious and easily digestible foods and avoid stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol. The main aspect is to rely on the special medicine for lung disease, "Bu Fei Yi Na Er" (Lung Supplement One Er), to increase the calcium content of the lungs and kill tubercle bacilli. Therefore, lung disease, no matter what stage it reaches, can be completely cured from the root. Therefore, the popularity of "Bu Fei Yi Na Er" in various countries is by no means accidental.</p>
<h3>The Damage of Masturbation to Brainpower</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>Regarding masturbation, medical scientists have conducted countless investigations and researches, which have proven that this behavior is easy to become unrestrained, and once committed, it is generally difficult to quit.</p>
<p>However, which part of the body is most susceptible to the harmful effects of such behavior? Dr. Henry Havelock Ellis, a famous British sex expert, pointed out that the brain marrow is the first part to suffer, followed by sexual function, and finally the spinal nerves. Because the motivation for masturbation arises from erotic fantasies in the brain marrow, it must consume a large amount of imaginative power, and then use various methods to achieve the purpose of masturbation. Therefore, people who suffer from masturbation will first suffer from insomnia, and then memory loss, headaches, heaviness in the head, and other morbid states will appear one by one. Therefore, there are many middle school students whose academic performance declines due to excessive masturbation.</p>
<p>To treat this disease, one must first prohibit the bad habit of masturbation and strive to go to bed early and get up early, be pure in heart and few in desires, and then take the "Bu Ti Kang," a male preparation made of testicle essence that nourishes the brain, kidneys, and blood. It can completely cure brain injuries and loss of libido and infertility caused by masturbation. However, if there is a phenomenon of nocturnal emission, three "Nai Er Si" (Niles) nocturnal emission tablets should be taken at the same time.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Chat</p>
<h3>The Truth and Treatment of Gonorrheal Discharge</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The truth of gonorrheal discharge, the forms it takes are different. Generally, this kind of gonorrheal discharge is not paid much attention to by patients during the acute phase because the purulent fluid in the urethra during acute gonorrhea flows copiously, so there is no need to distinguish the truth of the gonorrheal discharge. However, after gonorrhea passes through the acute phase and becomes chronic, this kind of gonorrheal discharge, which is most irritating and annoying to patients, persists for a long time. In fact, wherever there are traces of gonococci in the body of gonorrhea patients, inflammation occurs, and this inflammation is often a necessary condition for the production of gonorrheal discharge. Therefore, patients with gonorrhea who have not cleared their gonorrheal discharge have not yet cured their gonorrhea. However, there are also cases where the gonococcal toxins have been cleared, but the epithelial cells have peeled off, or other pyogenic cocci are causing trouble. Therefore, it cannot be generalized. In short, this kind of symptom must be treated by an experienced physician with complete equipment in order to obtain the truth and be cured.</p>
<p>The shape of the gonorrheal discharge is also very inconsistent, some are shaped like dots, and some are shaped like strokes. Most of them appear in the morning and in the urine of patients with chronic gonorrhea. Generally, all symptoms of chronic gonorrhea have them, and the residual inflammation of posterior urethral gonorrhea is most common. Other conditions such as prostatitis and cystitis also have this symptom. Therefore, to eliminate this kind of gonorrheal discharge, a comprehensive treatment must be used. Therefore, among oral medications, the drug "Ke Lin Nong" (Gram-Negative Nong) has to be recommended as a giant. Physical therapy, German static electricity therapy, is the leader of various electrotherapies. In addition, surgical operations are used. Therefore, the gonorrheal discharge that is difficult to eradicate can be completely cured in three to five weeks. I have repeatedly tried it with success in my clinical practice for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 registrations are sent out every day, each registration costs five jiao, and two copies of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases," worth one yuan, are given away.</p>

<h3>Increasing Rent at This Time is Tantamount to Accelerating the Collapse of the Market - A Person in Charge of a Certain Public Organization Expresses the Need to Stop It - Thousands of Tenants of Jianye Company Firmly Oppose It</h3>
<p>The soaring prices in Shanghai have affected the vast majority of citizens, making it difficult to maintain even the minimum standard of living. However, at this time, some property owners still want to propose rent increases to tenants and continue to implement oppression. Recently, rent disputes have occurred successively in places such as East and West Siwen Lane on Xinzha Road and Zunde Lane on Xiamen Road. According to a person in charge of a certain public organization, the post-war Shanghai market has formed a superficial prosperity due to the surge in population, but consumption exceeds production. We have long expected that it would be difficult to maintain for a long time. In recent years, unprecedentedly high prices have made it difficult for refugees to live for a long time. Western newspapers have even speculated that if this situation continues to worsen, in six months, Shanghai will have empty houses but no one to rent, as was the case before the war. At this time, property owners are still increasing rents, which is tantamount to adding insult to injury and accelerating the collapse of the entire market. The authorities should come forward to stop this abnormal situation in order to maintain public life and the entire market. It is also reported that the China Jianye Real Estate Company, on the pretext of foreign exchange contraction, recently notified the tenants of various lanes under its jurisdiction, such as Wanyi Fang on Luban Road, Paris New Village, Bugao Lane on Albert Road, Huayuan Fang on Father Jin Road, Renji Lane on Ximen Road, Jianye Lane on Fuli Road, Xilin Lane on Jiasiyi Road, Xingshun Lane on Ganshidong Road, and houses in Bailbu Road, Pushi Road, and Dapu Bridge, to increase rents by 30% from September 1. Most tenants believe that this rent increase is the second time since the war. At this critical time, the lives of residents in the isolated island are generally difficult. If rents continue to be increased again and again, they will be stretched to the limit and unable to bear the burden. Therefore, all tenants unanimously resolutely refuse and jointly send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession requesting assistance in mediation. However, it is learned that the company does not sympathize with the requests of thousands of tenants and will still implement the rent increase. Therefore, all tenants are extremely angry and determined to unite and carry out reasonable resistance. In addition to sending representatives to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association to request assistance in mediation, they have also hired Chinese and French lawyers as legal advisors and will appeal to the court for handling if necessary.</p>
<h3>The Property of the "Manure King" Will Be Sealed Up - Heirs Involved in Litigation Due to Debts - Each Holds a Different View, the Court Orders Another Trial</h3>
<p>After the death of Ma Fuqi, the "Manure King," his estate was worth 100,000 yuan. Initially, it was managed by his wife (nicknamed Sister Agui), who established the Ma Gui Ji accounting firm. After Ma's wife died, it was jointly managed by his sons Ma Hongkui, Hongsheng, and Honggen. Not long after, Ma Hongkui also died of illness.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of estate management</p>
<p>Hongkui's wife, Ma Chen, along with her children Ma Lusen, Luzhen, and Luying, litigated with Ma Hongsheng and Honggen in the Second Special Court. After nearly two years, it was resolved through mediation by relatives and friends. In addition to the equal division of all the estate among the three families, the 21 houses and land in Kangji Lane on Malang Road and the 8 houses and land in Shunyang Lane on Caishi Road were also assigned to the three families of Ma Hongkui, Hongsheng, and Honggen.</p>
<p>Common Property</p>
<p>As the ancestral property of Ma Zhu Ji, no family may dispose of it individually. Recently, Ma Luying, the daughter of Ma Hongkui, stated that her mother Chen and her siblings Ma Lusen and Luzhen were involved in a loan dispute with a Mrs. Zhou, and Zhou petitioned the court to seal up the above-mentioned two properties. Ma Luying expressed her dissent and hired lawyer Xu Yinrong to submit a statement to the Civil Division of the Second Special Court</p>
<p>Opposing the Sealing Up</p>
<p>Stating that the properties on Kangji Lane, Malang Road, and Shunyang Lane, Caishi Road, are the common property of the plaintiff's late father, Ma Hongkui, and uncles, Ma Hongsheng and Ma Honggen. The plaintiff's late father should have received one-third of the total, and the plaintiff, her mother Chen, and her siblings Lusen and Luzhen each received one-quarter of this one-third. Zhou, on the pretext of a loan dispute with the plaintiff's mother and siblings, etc.</p>
<p>Loan Disputes</p>
<p>Sealed up the above-mentioned two properties, which damaged the plaintiff's interests. Because the plaintiff never borrowed money from Zhou, she could not but declare her objection to the sealing up of all the property. The court accepted the statement. The case was briefly heard by Judge Wu in the Civil Seventh Division the day before yesterday and then ordered a postponement for another trial.</p>
<h3>A Den of Opium Smokers Was Cracked Down</h3>
<p>According to the Ningbo Newspaper, the French Concession Mailan Police Station received information that someone had established an opium-selling agency at No. 11 Baoyu Lane, Ningyu Street, a three-story building. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 19th (the day before yesterday), they secretly dispatched Chinese and French detectives to arrest them. Unfortunately, these people were well-informed and had already fled. Only a den of opium smokers was found on the third floor, and five men and one woman who were addicted to smoking opium were arrested, along with their smoking paraphernalia. They were all taken to the police station and detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>On the Day Before Yesterday, a Japanese Warship Caused Trouble in the High Tide of the Huangpu River - A Jardine Matheson Lighter Was Hit While Turning Around in the High Tide - The Stern of the Ship Turned and Sank Two Sampans</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the turbulent currents of the Huangpu River caused another accident yesterday (the 19th). The No. 17 Giru (transliteration) Maru of the Japanese Navy destroyer sank two small river boats in order to avoid a lighter belonging to Jardine Matheson. Then it drove straight towards a tugboat and a lighter of the Muller Company, causing the tugboat and lighter to turn around and hit a wood-carrying boat. Previously, the warship was at</p>
<p>10:05 AM</p>
<p>Turning around in the high tide, preparing to berth at buoys No. 2 and No. 3. When the ship turned sideways in the river, the Jardine Matheson No. 8 tugboat towed a No. 16 lighter downstream towards the Japanese warship. The tugboat captain was quite frightened and attempted to avoid getting caught in the Japanese warship, which was lying horizontally in the river. He then</p>
<p>Cut the Cables</p>
<p>Released the lighter, but the lighter still touched the port side of the Japanese warship, breaching the oil tank. The Japanese warship quickly turned its stern to avoid the lighter, but unexpectedly, the stern crashed into a group of sampans, sinking two of them. The Japanese warship then moved forward towards Pudong, moving the stern of the ship away from the sampans. At that time, there was a</p>
<p>Muller Company</p>
<p>A tugboat towing a lighter was going upstream, near buoys No. 2 and No. 3, when it was in great danger of being hit by the Japanese warship. It turned to avoid the Japanese warship, causing the lighter towed behind the wheel to hit a Chinese ship carrying timber, causing it to be severely damaged. The tide was running high at the time, so it was difficult to attribute blame to anyone for the collision.</p>
<p>Tugboat Captain</p>
<p>Apparently thought that by cutting the cables, the lighter would be able to float past the Japanese warship, but the river tide caused it to hit the port side of the Japanese warship directly. The Japanese warship Girumaru is now berthed at buoys No. 2 and No. 3 on the Huangpu River, with a small hole on the port side of the oil tank caused by the lighter.</p>
<h3>A Young Woman Died Tragically - Stabbed Forty or Fifty Times</h3>
<p>Jiang Zhao, a young woman from Jiangbei, 24 years old, residing at a certain number in Lane 103 (i.e., Chunyang Lane) on Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, wearing white linen pants and a linen waistcoat, was stabbed all over her body with a sharp knife in her room at around 9:25 last night, totaling as many as forty or fifty stabs. Blood gushed out like a spring, and she died on the spot. The murderer took the opportunity to escape. Neighbors discovered it and reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate the scene, called an ambulance to transport the body to Renji Hospital, and then transferred it to the autopsy station, pending notification to the court for examination.</p>

<p>Jiang Shen, a woman from Ningbo, 38 years old, residing at No. 66 Xiafei Road, her 7-year-old son, Jiang Futong, was playing on the sun deck of the four-story apartment at around 8:00 AM on the 19th when he accidentally fell from a height onto the cement ground at the back door, injuring his head. Shen discovered it and immediately sent him by rickshaw to Yongchuan Hospital, across from the Empire Theater. He died of his injuries at 6:00 PM that afternoon. It was reported to the Second Special Court today to send someone to examine the body.</p>
<h3>Wang Junqing's Fraud Case - Jia Bonian is Innocent</h3>
<p>Juli Foreign Firm's Shanghai branch is located at No. 9 on the Bund. A man named Wang Junqing, in the name of a comprador of the branch, collected a deposit of 1,000 yuan from Le Xiaofu of Hubei (resident of No. 9, Lane 118, Huanlong Road) on May 26 of this year, promising to appoint Le as the director of the shipping department of the foreign firm in Hankou. Later, the head office of the foreign firm suspended the business of the Shanghai branch, and Le's position also came to nothing. Wang Junqing was charged in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for collecting deposits from various liaison officers. Le Xiaofu believed that Jia Bonian, who worked in the shipping industry, was in collusion with Wang Junqing to defraud him of the deposit. Recently, he submitted a statement to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Jia of fraud. Jia hired two lawyers, Yang Ruinian and Wu Chuliang, to defend him. The case was investigated by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, and Jia Bonian was declared innocent yesterday.</p>
<h3>Two People Were Beaten While Negotiating Special Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, two yellow people of unknown nationality wearing purple-red suits (one evening, Korean) went to a certain number in Pingkang Lane, Kangti Road, French Concession, to negotiate special goods. While passing in front of No. 318 Caishi Road, several people suddenly talked to the two people of unknown nationality. It cannot be proved that these people and the people of unknown nationality knew each other before. Later, the two sides quarreled from the negotiation, first verbally, and then physically. At that time, many people on the road stopped to watch. As a result, the two people of unknown nationality were slightly injured. When the nearby patrol guards heard the alarm and rushed over, the people involved had already dispersed into the crowd. The patrol guards took the two people of unknown nationality to the police station to investigate the incident and then sent them by car to the hospital to treat their minor injuries.</p>
<h3>The Former and Current Principals of Juxun Primary School on Hartung Road are Involved in Litigation - The Court Ruled to Suspend the Trial Before Confirming Their Identities</h3>
<p>Chen Binzhang, currently residing at No. 13 Beigaoshou Lane, Averquin Road, recently submitted a statement to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Cao Chinian (i.e., Cao Ziying, 31 years old this year), a native of Jiading, the principal of Juxun Primary School, No. 32 Cihou South Lane, Hartung Road, of embezzlement and breach of trust. The gist of his accusation is that Juxun Primary School was founded solely by the plaintiff, who served as its principal. In the past two years, due to being busy with other matters, he left the affairs of the school to the defendant, Cao Chinian. Unexpectedly, Cao betrayed his trust and</p>
<p>Occupied the School</p>
<p>Therefore, he had no choice but to file a lawsuit, etc. After receiving a copy of the accusation of embezzlement and breach of trust, the defendant Cao Chinian immediately hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to write a reply, raising several points: (1) Stating that Juxun Primary School was founded by the respondent in the autumn of the 25th year of the Republic of China. At that time, in order to cope with the environment, he hired the plaintiff to serve as honorary principal. The rent of the house and all expenses were borne by the respondent.</p>
<p>School Administration</p>
<p>Was also handled by the respondent. Starting in the autumn of the following year, the board of directors elected the respondent as principal. This situation was known to the school staff and students' parents. The plaintiff recently suffered from economic depression and kicked a friend out of his house. He took advantage of a misunderstanding between the school and Hartung Foreign Firm over rent increases and repairs to the school building, falsely claiming that the school was founded by the plaintiff, which is not allowed by law. Because the plaintiff is neither the actual tenant of the school building nor the taxpayer of the house, nor does he have any documents to prove the establishment of Juxun Primary School.</p>
<p>Documents Available for Verification</p>
<p>And the Shanghai Education Overview and the Shanghai School Survey Record all indicate that the respondent is the principal of Juxun Primary School, which shows that the facts alleged by the plaintiff are fictitious. He requested that the respondent be declared innocent. The court accepted the statement. Judge Huang held a court hearing the other day, and both parties held their own opinions. The court decided that the case could not proceed until the plaintiff Chen Binzhang's identity as the principal was confirmed. Therefore, the court ruled to suspend the trial of this case.</p>
<h3>The Murder Case of a Tenant at No. 1 Yuanshang Lane - The "Morphine King" Was Arrested - The Main Culprit's Wife's Confession Attempted to Deny It - Ma Pi Abiao Shirked Responsibility and Denied It</h3>
<p>At No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, the second landlord was Auntie Chai Gong, a native of Shaoxing, who lived on the mezzanine floor. The second floor was rented to He Jingqing, the owner of the Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Fuzhou Road, who lived with his son-in-law. The third floor was rented to the car driver Zhang Xiaomao and his wife, both from Chaozhou. However, disputes often arose among the cohabitants. At around 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, Zhang Xiaomao brought out</p>
<p>The "Morphine King"</p>
<p>Shen Abiao (nicknamed Ma Pi Abiao) residing at No. 553 Averquin Road, gathered dozens of hooligans, together with female hooligan Yang Yashi, and the escaped robber Lao San and four or five others, each holding wooden sticks and knives, and swarmed into He Jingqing's room, destroying all the debris. They also stabbed He's partner, Li Binghuan, with a knife, causing blood to flow like a torrent, and he fell to the ground. He himself was also injured internally by wooden sticks. The murderers and others, seeing that their goal had been achieved,</p>
<p>Scattered and Fled</p>
<p>After the incident, He reported the injuries to the police station, which sent detectives to Qunleju Tea House on Gongguan Road and arrested six male and female hooligans, including Shen Abiao, Su Shichang, Chen Bingsheng, Li Julin, and Yang Yashi. However, the main culprit Zhang Xiaomao had already fled after hearing the news. Only his wife, Zhang Chen, was arrested, and they were all taken to the police station and handed over to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for investigation. The victim He Jingqing and Li Binghuan, accompanied by lawyer Zhang Fukang, arrived at the case to provide information about the incident and to attach a civil lawsuit, requesting</p>
<p>A Judgment Ordering Compensation</p>
<p>For medical expenses, etc. Subsequently, the defendant Zhang Chen confessed that the incident was caused by the second landlord and her son-in-law forcing them to increase the rent. Her husband, Zhang Xiaomao, only agreed to increase it by two or three yuan per month, but He and others insisted on increasing it by ten yuan. At that time, her husband refused, so He and others often provoked trouble. Therefore, she could not bear it and asked a friend to go and take revenge, etc. When questioned about Shen Abiao, he shirked all responsibility and denied it. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge ordered a postponement for retrial on the 22nd of this month. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>The Murderer Was Released Due to Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>Wang Huorong, a native of Liuhe, was assassinated in Zhao Wang Temple, Liuhe, on June 13 of this year. Recently, his adopted brother, Guo Wenhua, learned that his brother's death was caused by Zhou Huaiqing, a fellow villager. Recently, he met Zhou on Sichuan Road, Hankou Road, and reported him to the police, who arrested and escorted him to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. However, during the postponement, the evidence that Guo could produce was only Wang Huorong's wife's statement that she heard rumors that her husband was killed by Zhou. However, how could the police station use hearsay as evidence? Because Guo could not provide any further conclusive evidence, the police station's lawyer, Jiang Baolian, applied to the First Special Court to stop the detention of Zhou and release him. Judge Feng Shide approved it and ordered Zhou's release.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>The people of Xikang never eat fish. It is said that this is because, in Xikang, when a person dies, their family throws the body into the river for the fish to eat, considering it a water burial.</p>
<p>Eskimos consider "eating" the happiest thing in life. They have a very large appetite. A young man under the age of twenty can eat eight and a half pounds of seal meat and one and one-sixth pounds of bread in a single day.</p>
<p>The current President of the Control Yuan, Mr. Yu Youren, likes to wear cloth shoes and socks and has never worn gauze or silk shoes and socks in his life.</p>
<p>The Mongolian people like to eat raw meat, just as the people of Hunan like to eat spicy food. Furthermore, the Mongolian people do not bathe or wash their faces year-round.</p>
<p>When Mr. Wu Zhihui has nothing to do, he likes to go to small restaurants to eat "snacks." When Mr. Wu goes out, he often wears a small vest over his long gown.</p>
<p>In Africa, there is a tribe called the Mbuti. They like to eat human flesh and often go to other places in groups to "hunt humans." When they capture prisoners, they eat their flesh.</p>
<p>Recently, a dish in Kunming restaurants has become very popular among the locals. It is called "Elephant Trunk and Deer Tendon."</p>
<h3>Attention Leather Shoe Wearers</h3>
<p>— Zhenqing</p>
<p>The number of people wearing leather shoes is increasing nowadays, as if not wearing a pair of leather shoes does not show one to be a Shanghai person. As a result, leather shoe stores are springing up like mushrooms after the rain. However, the cost of a pair of leather shoes is at least around ten yuan. Often, many people find that the shoe uppers are still good after a short time, but the thick soles are already broken. It should be known that each leather shoe has two plum blossom-shaped nails on the bottom. Their roots are very deep and can penetrate all the way into the sole. If one is not careful and wears them after a heavy rain, water will definitely seep in. After three times, the soles will have rotted and broken, and they will be difficult to repair. They will become useless on rainy days. Wouldn't it be a pity to discard them? If, when buying leather shoes, one pours raw alum on them to plug the holes of the two nails, then they will be more durable and long-lasting. When it rains, more shoe polish should be applied to make them shine, because leather is not easily penetrated by water!</p>
<h3>The Latest Square Inlay Trend in Paris</h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>Diamonds are the most precious ornaments for modern women. They have a sparkling brilliance, especially under the dazzling lights, so bright that people are dazzled, as if the diamonds are emitting magic light. Contemporary artisans are putting a lot of fine work into diamond inlay techniques to lure the extravagant hearts of noble urban women.</p>
<p>In the past, inlaying took the form of single diamonds. Rings, earrings, or bracelets were based on a single large diamond, surrounded by small diamonds in a circular pattern. Since the popularity of three-dimensional and streamlined designs, diamond artisans have immediately used their brains to apply them to diamond inlay techniques. The trend began to sprout in the second half of 1938, and this year, square inlay has dominated the entire jewelry world, especially the Parisian style, which is the standard for the world and is popular all over the globe. The image above is one type of square inlay. It uses two large diamonds as the main body, with a row of small square diamonds running horizontally in the middle, and small round diamonds embellishing both sides, forming a rectangular strip. This is the most popular ring in Paris in 1939. Women's bracelets also use rectangular platinum as the base, with small square and round diamonds arranged in a streamlined pattern, and a few large diamonds set off in between, further highlighting the strong brilliance. The bracelet chains are made of three strands of pearls, luxurious and rich, fully expressing the style.</p>
<p>The first store in Shanghai to introduce this square inlay is the Beilaiheng Jewelry Store on Maixiai Road. The owner of this store has an older brother in Paris, who sends him new styles every month. There are many designs that have not been seen in Shanghai. At the same time, he purchases many inlaying instruments from Paris, which are said to be the most complete equipment.</p>
<h3>A Week's Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Speaking of dishes made with gourds, last week I introduced winter melon soup. I'm sure many of you readers have tried it. Winter melon itself doesn't have any special flavor; "light" can be used to describe it. It is most suitable for making soup, as it can be used at any time as long as there is fresh broth. Because it has been extremely hot since autumn, I still focus on the word "light" when cooking. The other day I made a winter melon and pork lung soup. It is said that pork lung is good for nourishing the lungs, so people with coughs are quite fond of it. When washing it, one must put in a lot of effort, carefully removing the blood vessels, washing it clean, and then buying some ham bones to put together with it. Cut the winter melon into squares, add some fragrant mushrooms and other ingredients, and simmer slowly in the pot until it is tender. The soup will be clear and the taste fresh, and the pork lung will be tender and delicious. There is also a pork heart, which often comes with the lung. After simmering it until tender, its taste is even better than the lung. Come on! Why don't you all give it a try?</p>

<h3>Mezzanine</h3>
<p>— Xiangqi</p>
<p>Building a mezzanine is a desperate measure. If there are too many things and there is no place to put them, and the corners are already full, then a mezzanine is built to store miscellaneous items. There is also another type where the family has many people, and they have no choice but to build a mezzanine to avoid crowding. The most embarrassing thing is the sub-landlord who makes a living solely from mezzanines. Most sub-landlords sublet the remaining rooms for profit. Although money is coveted by everyone, it must be of a considerable amount, as the so-called "gentleman loves wealth, but obtains it in a proper way." For example, this sub-landlord has already built a mezzanine and has already made money from the mezzanine. Naturally, they should no longer, in these years, expand the area of the mezzanine as if taking advantage of a fire, or add a third layer of mezzanine, only caring about their own income, regardless of whether others are annoyed or not, or whether it is dangerous or not. It should be known that adding a new mezzanine, for the sake of making money, must mean a new family moving in. More families will inevitably increase the population, which is the same as having a highly dangerous stove. Hygiene is certainly out of the question, but the problem of fire is really terrifying. On a large scale, it can affect other people's lives, and in short, it can be said to be a problem for the entire society. Therefore, the former concession authorities strictly banned mezzanines, and everyone was wary of this. Who knew that, as time passed, everyone had faintly forgotten about it, and a group of profit-seeking sub-landlords, seeing the urgent need for housing, put their minds to work and, at any cost, used their clever deceptive means to apply for permits from the authorities, which has become increasingly common recently. If this continues to spread, public danger will inevitably continue to increase, and there will be more worries about society.</p>
<p>This situation is most prevalent in Yongji Lane on Wangzhi Road, near where I live. The number of houses that have been rebuilt and had mezzanines added can be counted, but there are still many who are doing it secretly. I hope that the authorities will immediately stop this to avoid disasters.</p>
<h3>One Person Gets Rich, Millions Starve</h3>
<h3>The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of the World's Four Greats</h3>
<p>— Yin Sanlang</p>
<p>Speaking of the world's four great figures, I think readers will all know them. They are Adolf Hitler of Germany, Prime Minister Benito Mussolini of Italy, President Chiang Kai-shek of China, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. They are regarded as great figures by the world because they are praised for their political achievements. Although the policies and ideologies of each country are different, their clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all on the same front of not wasting, being very frugal, and being very hardworking. If we compare this with the extravagant degree of Shanghai's current wealthy people in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, how ashamed we would feel!</p>
<p>Clothing</p>
<p>Hitler has a lifelong quirk: he doesn't like to wear wool fabrics like serge. Therefore, most of his suits are made of velvet. His favorite is Hanique velvet, produced by the Henpilon factory in Berlin, and it is also cheap. The middle and upper-class people of Germany can afford it, costing only about sixty-some legal tender yuan. Mussolini, because he came from a poor background, still likes to wear that gray-blue general's uniform, even though he is now a noble prime minister. The texture is not particularly noble. As for formal wear or casual wear, he only wears it occasionally, except for banquets with relatives or horse rides for excursions. President Chiang usually wears long gowns. The gown material is ordinary wool fabric, with only a few more valuable formal dresses! His general's uniform and suit are worn depending on the time and nature of the occasion. However, his raw materials are always domestic, and there is not a single imported item. Stalin likes to wear serge, which is the opposite of Hitler's temperament. It is estimated that most of his clothes are made of domestic raw materials, with fewer foreign goods. Among his military and casual wear, wool fabrics are in the majority, and he mostly wears military uniforms.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Hitler likes to eat sweet things and hates stimulating foods the most. It is said that this is because the doctor has tested his physique and found it extremely unsuitable. However, after each meal, he likes to eat a lot of fruit. I remember that in the summer of the year before last, when he was vacationing in Wonita City, he ate seven apples at once after a certain meal, which caused him a very serious gastrointestinal illness, and it took more than a month to recover! Mussolini's eating habits are the opposite of Hitler's. He likes stimulating flavors, and almost every dish has this flavor. He loves to eat ear gristle shark (produced in South Africa and the Malay Archipelago) and wild rabbit and other animal meats. President Chiang's meals consist of no more than five or six dishes per meal. We know that some wealthy families must eat delicacies from mountains and seas, and they are even more extravagant at banquets. When we see President Chiang's virtues of thrift and diligence, we should deeply be alarmed and awakened. President Chiang likes to eat Jinling salted duck and Jinhua ham. His meals are entirely in the Fenghua style of his hometown. Stalin loves salty flavors and eats all kinds of wild animal meats. He also likes birds. The tender meat of seahorses and elk is best suited to his appetite. He always uses it to accompany his meals once or twice a week.</p>
<p>Housing</p>
<p>Mussolini and President Chiang have some similar personalities. They both like quietness and cleanliness. The furnishings in the house only need to be simple and aesthetically pleasing, not too luxurious. It is best if they can have a kind of rural flavor. Speaking of Hitler's and Stalin's private residences, they are very luxurious. Hitler's official residence is the world-famous Nymphenburg, while Stalin's villa on the banks of the Yauza River in Moscow is more luxurious, but his official residence is very ordinary.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>If we infer their behavior based on each person's personality, it is quite accurate. Like Mussolini and Hitler, they like to hunt and fish because they love to eat animal meat. President Chiang likes to climb mountains and visit historical sites. He also diligently and tirelessly studies state affairs on weekdays. As for theaters and restaurants, he will never go there unless absolutely necessary. Stalin likes to watch plays, ride horses, and swim. He loves horseback riding even more, because he has been accustomed to military life since childhood, so horseback riding has become his hobby.</p>

<h3>Should the Black Market for Foreign Exchange Be Maintained?</h3>
<p>— Shi Weitao</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, almost all of China's original treaty ports have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army; and the attempt to control the economy has also followed. The establishment of the United Reserve Bank of North China and the Huaxing Bank, the issuance of counterfeit money, and the attempt to replace the circulation of legal tender are all enough to show the magnitude of its ambitions. However, the fact that it has not proceeded as smoothly as originally planned to this day is mainly due to the consolidated foundation of the legal tender, which is widely trusted by the people, and even hoarded by the masses as cash. After receiving Japanese and puppet banknotes, they are used out at any time, which should be one of the main reasons. The reason why legal tender can gain the trust of the people is due to the unreliability of the counterfeit currency itself, and the people's trust in the government. Maintaining the exchange rate of the open market in Shanghai (the so-called black market), so that legal tender can freely buy and sell foreign exchange at any time, will undoubtedly have indelible achievements. Recently, it has been rumored in the market that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will no longer maintain the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange. However, the gain or loss between maintaining and abandoning it is of great importance. Therefore, I will not hesitate to discuss and study it from my limited perspective.</p>
<p>Before discussing whether the black market for foreign exchange should be maintained, please first compare the advantages and disadvantages of the current maintenance policy.</p>
<p>Advantages: (1) The biggest function of maintaining the black market for foreign exchange is to enable legal tender to be exchanged for foreign exchange at any time, enhance people's faith, and resist the invasion of Japanese and puppet banknotes. After a large number of Japanese and puppet banknotes invade, they can increase the issuance of banknotes as military expenses, reduce the burden on their own country, use them as funds for developing enterprises, and use the resources of the guerrilla areas. The benefits gained by the Japanese side may exceed those obtained from arbitrage in the current foreign exchange market. (2) It can preserve the commercial interests of friendly countries and win the favor of foreigners.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: (1) Because the buying and selling of foreign exchange is unrestricted, the Japanese side can freely obtain foreign exchange with the legal tender they have plundered. (2) It has created a huge trade deficit in Shanghai, and the imported goods such as cotton and wheat are needed by the Japanese side and are not what the people need. Therefore, there is a drawback that the foreign exchange fund is transferred to the hands of the Japanese, which must be prevented.</p>
<p>To sum up, the policy of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to maintain the black market is indeed impeccable. However, the unrestricted policy has created the heartbreaking phenomenon of funds flowing into the hands of the Japanese, which must be improved. Recently, there have been many articles in newspapers and magazines discussing this, and I have compiled them for discussion.</p>
<p>1.  Do not maintain the black market for foreign exchange, let it rise and fall on its own, and find its own level. This means that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will stop supplying foreign exchange to the black market. Under normal circumstances, there is no need to supply the Shanghai foreign exchange market, because the balance of imports and exports can stabilize the exchange rate. In other words, the demand of exporters for legal tender is equal to the supply of importers, so legal tender can maintain its normal state. Over the years, although Shanghai has often been a trade deficit port, it has been reduced to about four pence according to the current exchange rate. The price of foreign goods has soared, the people's demand for foreign goods has naturally decreased, and exports have increased sharply due to the benefit of the exchange rate, making it easy to find its own level. However, the environment in Shanghai is unusual. The need for foreign exchange not only comes from importers; most of it is from the Japanese side who are desperately grabbing foreign exchange in the foreign exchange black market with the legal tender they have plundered; and the large number of foreign cotton orders from Japanese yarn factories. (Since the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, it may be reduced, but it still needs to be proven by figures.) May I ask, under such circumstances, coupled with the turmoil in the financial market and the people's craze for buying foreign exchange and gold, can the foreign exchange earned from Shanghai's exports meet the needs of the market? If the Exchange Stabilization Fund stops maintaining it, the Japanese will buy foreign exchange in the market at any price with the legal tender they have plundered, in order to destroy the credit of legal tender; coupled with the fueling of speculators and the blind purchase of foreign exchange and gold by the blind, the consequences will be disastrous. Although the value of legal tender in the interior will not be reduced due to the changes in the Shanghai black market; the result may be that a large amount of legal tender flows into the interior, forming a gratifying phenomenon of capital flowing backwards, but when legal tender gradually flows into the interior, I am afraid that Japanese and puppet banknotes will also invade, and the so-called "East Asian Economic Cooperative System" that the Japanese have dreamed of will be realized. After all, it is definitely not something we can agree with. Shanghai is a fortress to prevent the Japanese from controlling the economy of the guerrilla areas and must be fully guarded.</p>
<p>2.  Import and export firms and foreign exchange banks organize foreign exchange clearing houses to implement a self-sufficient system. This kind of suggestion is valuable if it is implemented in peacetime. However, under the current situation, there are many difficulties. For example, when the Japanese buy foreign exchange at a higher price, there must be brave men under heavy rewards. Can export firms not be tempted by profits and strictly abide by selling foreign exchange to the clearing houses? Then, will the price of the clearing houses fall with the price offered by the Japanese? But the legal tender held by the Japanese can be sold at any price, and will the price of the clearing houses fall infinitely with it? Moreover, Shanghai is now in a huge trade deficit, and without a huge fund, how can the clearing houses achieve a balance? All of these are obstacles to the establishment of clearing houses.</p>
<p>3.  Foreign exchange approval system, that is, the current foreign exchange approval system in the interior is also implemented in Shanghai to supply foreign exchange for necessities. Such as rice, coal and other daily necessities for ordinary people, restricting the import of non-necessities and enemy-supporting items. The price should be slightly lower than the seven pence in the interior, or around the current new level of four pence. Then, the cost is not high, and the livelihood of the common people can be stabilized a lot. According to my speculation, the following points can occur as a result.</p>
<p>(1) The black market still exists. Regarding this point, Mr. Gong Jialin said in his article "Post-War Shanghai's Foreign Trade and Trade Deficit Problems in the Banking Industry": "The official price of one shilling and two and a half pence is used for buying and selling, and restrictions are implemented, so the so-called current foreign exchange black market has emerged. If this kind of black market trading is further restricted, the result will be the emergence of a second black market. The exchange rate of this black market will of course be lower than the newly set price. As a result, foreign exchange suppliers will definitely sell their foreign exchange in this second black market. As a result, won't the government-controlled banks only have foreign exchange sales but no purchases? Once verified by the situation of the foreign exchange black market since the establishment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund in early March, it can be seen that the Exchange Stabilization Fund is also often in the supply position. The result is ultimately payment. Instead of this, it is better to use an application system to stabilize the prices of general necessities with a limited number and stabilize people's hearts. To prevent the Japanese from arbitrage, the Exchange Stabilization Fund constantly shrinks the price, causing the entire financial market to become chaotic, and the prices of general civilian necessities also rise in proportion to luxury goods, affecting the livelihoods of the common people.</p>
<p>(2) The foreign exchange that the Japanese can arbitrage will be greatly reduced. Because the Japanese must wait until the supply of foreign exchange is greater than the needs of importers before they can obtain it. And each approved supply of foreign exchange cannot be arbitraged.</p>
<p>(3) Finance can be more stable. Because the approval system is adopted, no matter what policy the Japanese adopt in the second black market to buy foreign exchange at a high price. General necessities will not rise in price because foreign exchange is available. The psychology of the general public hoarding gold bars, foreign currency, and stockpiling goods will be greatly reduced. Because most people who buy gold bars and foreign currency are concerned about the unlimited fall of legal tender in order to preserve personal assets.</p>
<p>(4) Strengthen the tendency of capital inflow. Because the stipulated price in Shanghai is lower than that in the interior, it is more profitable to remit to the interior. Since the outbreak of the war, capital has flocked to Shanghai and stayed there, which is a pity. The difference in exchange rates and the high cost of remittance may be of some help in promoting it. However, if speculation and arbitrage trading in Shanghai are not curbed, I am afraid there will be no great effect. Because the interest on arbitrage is high, up to one or two cents. It is almost comparable to loan sharking, but the procedures are simple and the risk is minimal. It is inevitable that capital will be attracted by it. As mentioned above, the implementation of the approval system can reduce the Japanese's arbitrage opportunities compared with the current policies of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and can also reduce the expenditure of the Exchange Stabilization Fund; and it is not necessary to take emergency measures from time to time to make the exchange rate plummet and make people panic. However, compared with the policy of resolutely not maintaining it, it is more stable and there is no danger of Japanese and puppet banknotes invading. Because maintaining the policy requires the expenditure of funds, which has no direct benefit to our resistance war. But it is also enough to prevent the Japanese from attempting to control the economy and reduce their opportunities to use the resources of the guerrilla areas. Indirectly, it is of great help to the resistance war. Therefore, under the current situation, it is more appropriate to adopt the approval system.</p>
<h3>Postal Stamp Issues</h3>
<p>— Xie Liangxian</p>
<p>Since Mr. So-and-so brought up the issue of postal stamps, it has attracted a great deal of attention. This is because the number of postal stamps in circulation in Shanghai is very large, and their function is to replace subsidiary currency. In other words, postal stamps have become a kind of non-principal currency. However, postal stamps inherently lack the characteristics of currency. According to their nature, postal stamps serve as proof of advance payment for labor services. From the perspective of the purchaser, they are similar to deferred assets; conversely, for the issuer, the stamps represent a liability to be offset by the provision of labor services. Therefore, it is unprecedented, and indeed very difficult and contrary to regulations, to redeem postal stamps for cash—legal tender—or other substitute currency. However, the use of postal stamps as subsidiary currency in the market is an undeniable fact. Many people who previously had no need for postal stamps now have some. As Mr. So-and-so said, merchants generally have a dozen or so yuan's worth of stamps, and even peddlers often have a matchbox full.</p>
<p>In the near future, the issuance of new subsidiary currency will signal the end of the use of postal stamps. Moreover, the use of postal stamps was adopted by people for convenience, so their termination does not require any explicit order and will be immediately met with rejection. Furthermore, if the use of postal stamps is not stopped, according to Gresham's Law, the new currency cannot circulate. As a result, merchants who hold postal stamps will become averse to them, as they represent an excessive accumulation of idle assets, and they will eagerly seek to get rid of them. On the other hand, the demand elasticity for postal stamps is very low. We will certainly not use more matches just because matches are cheaper; similarly, we will not write more letters just because there are too many postal stamps. Consequently, these postal stamps will simply become surplus in society. Although their price may not be as greatly affected by supply and demand as other commodities, the public's aversion to them is sufficient to cause their value to fall. The fact that it is now common to buy 105 or even 115 fen for one yuan is clear evidence of this. This causes the public to suffer widespread unexpected losses. In terms of the ability to bear the burden, the most severely affected are the peddlers, creating the most economically unfair situation. Moreover, the postal stamps circulating in the market are mostly soiled and damaged due to frequent handling. According to the strict regulations regarding damaged postal stamps, aren't people essentially using waste paper as currency? This is really too dangerous! In other words, it should be remedied.</p>
<p>However, to make postal stamps flow from the market to another place, there must be attraction. The attraction is none other than redemption, and the redeemer must have the driving force of attraction as a necessary condition. That is, there must be financial resources. However, as mentioned above, postal stamps cannot be redeemed, so who will redeem them? This requires considerable consideration. It is of course not acceptable to simply write out my opinion, but it is no more than an ignorant offering.</p>
<p>I think the best way to redeem postal stamps is to exchange them for new subsidiary currency at the time of the new currency's issuance. This is like re-issuing promissory notes. Ideally, for the benefit of the people, the exchange should be at full value, but in reality, it would be acceptable to set a discount rate that reduces the public's losses, taking into account social conditions. This is because there is already sufficient evidence of price declines in the market for statistical purposes, and this would encourage postal stamps to leave the market through other channels, avoiding a lot of trouble. The difficulty, then, lies in how the bank issuing the new subsidiary currency will dispose of these postal stamps. First, we must recognize that postal stamps, if not redeemed by the post office, are essentially waste paper. To avoid conflicting with postal regulations, it would be best for the issuer of subsidiary currency to collaborate with the post office to use these postal stamps as collateral for loans, or as a form of rediscounting similar to promissory notes. An agreement should be made for repayment in installments, with the interest waived entirely. After all, it is the central bank's responsibility to incur some losses in order to adjust the currency! The post office, on the other hand, can repay part of the loan and destroy part of the soiled and damaged postal stamps. The losses incurred in printing costs can be compensated by the central bank's discount rate earnings. The repayment funds can be allocated from income, because the post office's accounting is clearly inaccurate, and the cost of labor services in accounting must be too high. In this special situation, a portion of the income is the result of labor services. Moreover, the amount of inaccuracy must correspond to the quantity of postal stamps issued for use as currency. Therefore, it is reasonable to allocate a portion of the income as a debt repayment reserve. This can also correct accounting errors, showing the true financial situation, which is truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Japanese Economy (Continued 4)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Feng Meiqi'an</p>
<p>This shows the importance of foreign markets to the stability of the Japanese economy. These foreign markets supply Japan with four-sevenths of its imports and purchase a little more than one-third of its exports, providing foreign exchange. Among these foreign markets, Germany and Italy are less important. In 1938, they supplied Japan with approximately 185 million yen worth of goods and purchased 40 million yen of its exports. The Tripartite Pact (including "Manchukuo") may slightly increase this number, but the increase will not be significant. If a European war occurs, regardless of whether Japan is involved, trade with the Axis powers will be automatically cut off.</p>
<p>Japan's trade with the United Kingdom is far greater than with Germany. In 1938, the approximate figures were: the United Kingdom supplied Japan with goods worth approximately 550 million yen, and Japan's exports to the United Kingdom were approximately 630 million yen. Adding France, the Netherlands, and their colonies, these figures rise to 675 million and 800 million, or two-fifths of Japan's foreign trade. If trade relations with these three countries are severed, Japan will suffer a heavy blow. In Southeast Asia, in 1938, French Indochina, British Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies supplied Japan with goods worth a total of 155 million yen and purchased 110 million yen of its exports. If the Japanese could control these colonies, their gains in oil, rubber, tin, and iron ore would be greater than current trade figures. On the other hand, if war damages oil wells, it will greatly affect their production. The difficulties Germany faced in organizing Romanian oil production during the Great War serve as a precedent. Therefore, Japan must plan for this in advance. If it can quickly gain control, the economic benefits gained are often significant. However, these colonies cannot supply Japan's huge needs for raw cotton, machinery, manufactured metal products, various minerals, and non-metals. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Inadequate Understanding Among Foreign Exchange Speculators</h3>
<p>— Gong Jialin</p>
<p>The Activity of Foreign Exchange Speculation</p>
<p>Since the Exchange Stabilization Fund suspended its supply of foreign exchange on the black market last month for the second time, in just a few days, the unofficial exchange rate has fallen from six and a half pence to just over four pence. Last week, rumors that the government had ordered the printing of 100 million yuan worth of banknotes in England caused panic in society, which speculators exploited to manipulate the market, causing both official and unofficial rates to shrink into the four-pence range, creating an unprecedentedly tight situation on the foreign exchange black market.</p>
<p>In fact, regarding the printing of a huge amount of new banknotes, even without definite confirmation from the government and related parties, we can judge from common sense that it is nonsense. We can ask ourselves: if the government really wanted to adopt inflation, would this highly secret and important information be casually leaked out? Even the most careless person would not be so negligent. This news is clearly either a misrepresentation or someone spreading rumors to cause harm. This is something we can understand.</p>
<p>However, the tendency towards speculation and capital flight has intensified. According to market estimates, more than 90 percent of recent foreign exchange transactions are due to this improper need. Previously, foreign exchange speculation was limited to wealthy individuals and those familiar with finance, but now even ordinary people with small savings are becoming active. This situation is undoubtedly quite serious.</p>
<p>The most fundamental reason why the activities of speculators and capital flight operators have become so heated recently is that they do not have a sufficient understanding of the true value of the legal tender. People in Shanghai, who have been living in a semi-occupied area for a long time, often have the misconception that the exchange rate on the open market represents the value of the legal tender. Two months ago, when the legal tender's black market exchange rate stabilized at 8.25 pence, they regarded the legal tender as worth 60% of its official value (based on the official rate of 14.5 pence). Now that it has fallen below 4 pence, it is not even worth 30%. According to this logic, has the value of the legal tender fallen by more than two times after only two months? Is this even possible? This kind of thinking is extremely wrong!</p>
<p>In a country with strict exchange controls, the emergence of a black market is unavoidable; however, in countries where the government has complete control, it is easier to suppress the black market, so its scope and power are relatively smaller. Shanghai, the financial center of our country, is already a part of the occupied area, and the government does not have complete power to control Shanghai's foreign exchange market, resulting in such a rampant black market situation. This is something we acknowledge, but we cannot use this local situation to represent the whole of China. In the complete regions of China, imports and exports of goods are still calculated according to the official exchange rate stipulated by the government. Can we say that the legal tender has fallen in value? Furthermore, isn't the Japanese yen in Shanghai now worth less than 4 pence? Why do we still say that Japan is maintaining the legal exchange rate?</p>
<p>Or, some people use the increase in the number of legal tender issued after the war as proof that the currency's value has fallen. It is true that the amount of legal tender issued has increased from more than 445 million yuan before the war in July to the recently announced 2.6 billion yuan, an increase of slightly less than 1.2 billion yuan. However, this increase should be attributed to a natural trend rather than financial needs. Since the reform of the currency system in November 1935, the amount of legal tender issued has gradually increased due to the collection of gold and silver, the exchange of miscellaneous banknotes, and the unification of the currency system. In November 1935, the amount issued was 570 million yuan, which increased to more than 1 billion yuan in less than two years by July 1937 before the war, almost tripling. This was not considered inflation at the time. This process continued after the war, and there was a special need to stimulate finance in the interior. It is clear that the slight increase in the issuance of legal tender in the past two years cannot be rashly regarded as inflation.</p>
<p>Or, some people cite the rising prices of goods in the interior as an excuse for the substantial decline in the purchasing power of the legal tender. In fact, this is a mistake due to insufficient observation. The rise in prices in the interior is limited to a few major cities, and the "luxury goods" that are not produced locally have risen particularly sharply. This is because a large number of relatively wealthy people have moved from occupied cities to interior cities, and the production capacity of the interior cities has failed to adapt. In most rural areas, however, prices have not increased much, which is something we need to understand. In the occupied cities, the increase in prices is mainly due to transportation obstacles and increased taxes. Once we win the final victory and restore order, the purchasing power of the legal tender will not only recover immediately, but will also be greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>The second mistake in understanding that speculators have made is to assume that the current exchange rate will only shrink and that there is no hope of rebound. Therefore, everyone is desperately going long, buying near and selling far, so that the exchange rate shrinks day by day. However, according to our speculation, this trend will definitely not last long. At this low exchange rate of 3.5 pence, almost all importers have been squeezed out, and the remaining demanders are only speculators going long and foolish capital flight operators. The power of the long side is definitely not unlimited. As the government strengthens the tightening of currency chips in the Shanghai market and the unreasonable difference between the true purchasing power of the legal tender and the market exchange rate increases, the long speculators will eventually collapse. By that time, it may be too late to rush to make a profit.</p>
<p>There is one more point that speculators should be aware of: although the Exchange Stabilization Fund has now abandoned maintaining the Shanghai black market, it does not mean that it will completely let it go. The Exchange Stabilization Fund can consider the situation and use its huge economic power to sanction the black market and punish speculative activities. This is not impossible.</p>
<p>The Due Awareness of Speculators</p>
<p>Speculation is a kind of gambling, so-called "profit" is of course unreliable. There are countless people who have lost their fortunes in this, and speculating in this volatile exchange market is indeed dangerous. At this time, whether for the benefit of the country or for personal benefit, there is no reason not to immediately reinvest this capital into production in the interior. Here are four reasons:</p>
<p>(1) When investing in production in the interior, you can still obtain foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate when purchasing necessary foreign production tools and raw materials.</p>
<p>(2) Industry and commerce in the interior are underdeveloped. Generally, investing in these virgin lands will bring high profits and great development potential.</p>
<p>(3) Government protection is complete and there are incentive measures. It is much more reliable than speculating on foreign exchange or investing in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>(4) Today, remitting funds from Shanghai to the interior not only does not require commission, but also provides generous subsidies. However, we believe that this is only a temporary phenomenon. Investors must not lose this opportunity.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that doing foreign exchange speculation and foreign exchange savings work in the current situation is an extremely boring thing. This unwise action of harming others and oneself should be stopped immediately, and this useful capital should be transferred to the interior to directly engage in production, or deposited in legal tender in interior banks to indirectly engage in production.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: The Disparity Between Cash Inflow and Outflow is Widening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial cash market was closed due to the weekly holiday. It was reported that trading outside the market initially occurred at the previous afternoon's closing price of 4,555 yuan, with a small number of transactions. Later in the morning, buyers raised the price to 4,560 yuan, but there were still no buyers. The exchange rate for gold jewelry from silverware shops remained at the original price of 460 yuan at the Da Tong Bank, and 458 yuan at the Xin Tong Bank. The purchase price had to be reduced by more than ten to twenty yuan. Furthermore, according to a London cable on the 19th, the price of English pure gold remained at £7 8s 7d per ounce. According to a London cable on the 19th, the silver market saw purchases from India and speculators, with a shortage of supply, resulting in a stable market. Large bars of silver saw an increase of 0.0625 in the near term and a further increase of 0.125 in the long term. The New York and Mumbai silver prices were closed and there were no cables.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar is in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The guild's listed prices for spot and refined white sugar remained unchanged. The price at this company was 40.3 yuan, while at other companies it was 40 yuan, and 32 yuan for transit sugar. The price of Taikoo refined white sugar was down by one cent. East China Company's B mark was 44 yuan, West China Company's 44.4 yuan, CW mark 44.1 yuan, CX mark 43.8 yuan, DY mark 43.4 yuan, HX mark 43.2 yuan. HX mark refined red sugar increased by 1.5 yuan to 27.5 yuan. Dutch red spot sugar was 35 yuan, transit sugar 28.5 yuan, with no other changes. There was increased demand for domestic sugar, but no actual transactions had taken place. East China red sugar was quoted at 32 yuan, Gao Diao green sugar at 27 yuan, and Zheng Mian red sugar at 41 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Golden Hooks from Guanli Already Sold</h3>
<p>New golden hook tails from Yantai Guanli have arrived in Shanghai. The quality and color are excellent and suitable for sales in this street. The opening price was 210 yuan to 220 yuan and has already been transacted.</p>
<h3>Domestic Dried Shrimp: New Goods are Difficult to Develop</h3>
<p>New dried shrimp from Yantai have just entered the market. Recently, a batch has arrived, and the brand name is asking for over 70 yuan, but certain goods on the market are abundant and only selling for 68 yuan. Buyers mostly seek to be cheap, so sales are quite restricted and no transactions have been completed.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Iron Nails Rise Again</h3>
<p>Although yesterday was Sunday, hardware transactions were not quiet. Among them, the market for iron nails was quite lively. Purchasers from the local construction gangs were the largest. The Tianjin gangs also purchased one to two hundred barrels. However, the shipping date must be Monday (today). The price of "Double Times" forks has risen sharply, with an increase of 2-3 yuan. The current market price is 34 yuan to 35 yuan per barrel. As a result, the factory's production is unusually crowded.</p>
<p>Wire nails are as attractive as iron nails, but the business is not as prosperous as iron nails. The amount purchased by the Tianjin gangs is also close to one hundred barrels. Standard prices continue to rise, such as 57 yuan for 3-inch nails, 54 yuan for 4-inch nails, 53 yuan for 5-inch nails, and 52 yuan for 6-inch nails.</p>
<h3>The Current Difficulties of the Shanghai Silk Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yang</p>
<p>(2) The crisis in the Shanghai silk industry is an inevitable process before victory, especially now that the War of Resistance is approaching its second stage!</p>
<p>The Future of Silk Industry Development Lies in Victory</p>
<p>The future development of the silk industry lies on the road to national liberation and victory. In other words, it is the eve of victory in the War of Resistance, which is also the winter season for the silk industry. I remember that in mid-November last year, there was an article in the economic supplement of this newspaper describing various aspects of the silk industry after the war. One section seemed to be about:</p>
<p>"...The future of China's industry, the future of China's silk industry, has only two paths. One is to engage in the national liberation revolution with great effort and sacrifice, in order to win the freedom to develop and strive to dominate the world. The other is to simply surrender, allowing others to "cooperatively develop" in a semi-colonial manner, turning ourselves into fertilizer to prolong their lives..."</p>
<p>At the same time, the future fate of the silk industry was estimated as follows:</p>
<p>"The rise of our country's national industry is the result of this decisive War of Resistance. The final victory of the War of Resistance... is also the time when our country's industry will flourish, and our country's silk industry will once again dominate the world. Our country is an agricultural country, and the emerging industries after victory will push our country into a new era. The silkworm enterprise is an integrated system of agriculture and industry, so this new era is undoubtedly a favorable period for the unprecedented renaissance of our country's silk industry..."</p>
<p>This is an accurate conclusion that everyone agrees with. However, why does this article say that the crisis in the Shanghai silk industry is an inevitable process? It is precisely because this decisive war is the upward development of Chinese national capital. Before victory arrives, the industry left behind within its sphere of influence will inevitably be tightly suppressed, in order to become the capital it hopes to use for "war to support war."</p>
<p>After the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the Shanghai silk industry became a sitting duck. However, it was still because Shanghai possessed many special conditions that it was said that the control of the Shanghai silk industry and the entire silk industry in the occupied areas had to be divided into several steps. This rumor, coupled with the truth that has been revealed in the past and at present, is that the inclusion of the Shanghai silk industry is probably about to arrive at the time of implementing the treatment of separation.</p>
<p>Inevitable Economic Points of Attack</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the quick victory and the high-profile century of war did not help, and the war has been forced to the second stage, they found the slogan "using war to support war" to pay checks to the country and cash them in the occupied areas. The attack on the silk industry was to launch a very severe lockdown on the Shanghai silk industry, following the "control" of Wuxi and the silkworm silk around the Shanghai-Nanjing line. It blocked the import of raw materials and the export of finished products.</p>
<p>Because the Shanghai silk industry itself has had many shortcomings in the past two years, there are gaps to exploit. The way to attack is to take a two-pronged approach of threats and inducements, deception and intimidation. Now let's take a look at the event of purchasing spring cocoons!</p>
<p>When the spring silkworms were about to go into the cocoon, the news came out that everyone was refused to go to the inland to collect cocoons, including third-country merchants. At this time, the Shanghai silk industry was filled with a pessimistic atmosphere. However, soon the news came out that everyone was allowed to go to collect orchids unconditionally. At this time, the mentality of the Shanghai silk industry changed from pessimism to luck, and luck turned into adventure. Therefore, more than 30 million yuan of funds were mobilized, and after the passes were sent to the interior, the cocoon collection was completed. Then, all were detained without any accommodation. However, soon it was shown that gold is omnipotent, as long as the conditions are agreeable, it can pass. This strategy is an old trick, that is, first make it despair, and then slightly relax to cultivate its psychology of compromise. Therefore, fresh cocoons shipped to Shanghai were first detained, and then the "tax issues" were carefully weighed. However, as it has developed to the present, it is honestly discussing confiscating 50% and releasing 50%. But in fact, a large number of fresh cocoons are still kept on the traffic lines in the occupied areas. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Travel Guide to America</h3>
<p>— Inquiries</p>
<p>As autumn approaches, students preparing to study in the United States are making arrangements for their departures. Although the number of students going to the US this year is not as large as in previous years due to the soaring exchange rate, it is still considerable. While details regarding the procedures for studying in the US and the journey itself have been extensively covered in this publication, many who are initially deciding to go to the US remain largely unfamiliar with life and everything else in that country. To facilitate students studying abroad, as well as those preparing to travel or conduct academic research in the US, the author will provide a brief report on various aspects of life there, including clothing, food, housing, and transportation, for reference.</p>
<p>US Time Zone Standards</p>
<p>Due to the differences in longitude between the east and west coasts of the United States, there are significant distinctions in timekeeping. Therefore, time standards are divided into four zones. The eastern states use "Eastern Time," the central states use "Central Time," the western states use "Mountain Time," and the far western states use "Pacific Time." Major cities in the east and central regions, such as New York, Boston, and Chicago, use "Daylight Saving Time" in the summer, which is one hour ahead of standard time, and revert back in the fall. Railway, bus, and ship timetables, as well as clocks in stations, use standard time throughout the year, without adjusting for summer. Those initially deciding to go to the US should take note of this.</p>
<p>US-Canada Border</p>
<p>Students or travelers to the US cannot enter Canada unless they have completed the necessary procedures in advance. Those going to the eastern United States often visit Niagara Falls. This place is located on the border between the US and Canada, with a long bridge in between. Americans can visit the Canadian side of the falls without restrictions, but if Chinese nationals are not careful, they may cross the bridge without going through US immigration, which can cause a lot of trouble when returning. If you can produce your passport, you may be allowed to return, but often you will be detained for several days until the Chinese Embassy in Washington can provide verification via telegram before being released. This point should be given special attention. If you wish to cross the bridge for sightseeing, you should present your passport to the immigration authorities at the bridgehead in advance, which may be successful. Although there are beautiful sights to see in Canada, smaller nations cannot enjoy them under unequal treatment. In Detroit, Michigan, there are also tunnels and ships connecting to Canada, and the situation there is similar to Niagara. This also requires attention. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>### Shaanxi Province: Dedicated to Transportation Construction</h3>
<p>Xi'an Dispatch: The Shaanxi provincial government, recognizing the urgency of passenger and freight transportation, is now focusing on transportation construction. According to responsible officials, Shaanxi Province has three major transportation construction projects underway: (1) The highway from Xianyang north to Tongguan, totaling 139 kilometers, is under construction and is expected to be completed by March next year. (2) The light railway from Baoji southwest through Fengxian to Shuangshipu, totaling 108 kilometers, is a joint project of the Longhai Railway and the provincial government and will also be completed soon. Freight transport methods are currently being planned. In the future, it is planned to extend the railway to Weixian in Gansu Province to reach the Baishui River. (3) The waterway from the Baishui River into the Jialing River, going south to Guangyuan in Sichuan, serves as a transportation link between Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces, with a total length of 330 kilometers. The Shaanxi Construction Department is actively organizing the river channel and repairing the towpaths, which are expected to be completed in November. In the future, transportation and freight transport between the three provinces will be smooth, transportation costs will be reduced, and gasoline can be saved, which is truly a great achievement in transportation.</p>
<h3>Travel Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Answer to Mr. Bao Rusong: 1. The lowest-priced ship ticket from Shanghai to Ningbo is 3.50 national currency per person. Upon arrival in Ningbo, you must submit a security deposit and proof of identity. 2. The coastal highway from Ningbo to Wenzhou is no longer smooth. It is best to travel via Xinchang, Dongyang, Yongkang, and Lishui. This section will cost about 30+ yuan.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Wang Zhijie: 1. The best way to travel from Shanghai to Yichang, Hubei, is to go through Vietnam, then Kunming, Guiyang, and Chongqing, and then take a riverboat to Yichang. The total travel cost, if taking official cabins on ships and third-class train seats, will be more than 330 national currency.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Yang Yang: 1. To go from Shanghai to Guilin, Guangxi, without going through Vietnam, you can travel via Ningbo. The ship ticket from Shanghai to Ningbo in the economy class is 3.50 yuan per person, the small train and highway from Ningbo to Jinhua is 11.70 yuan per person, the train from Jinhua to Yingtan is 5.80 yuan per person, the highway from Yingtan to Ji'an is 30 yuan per person, the highway from Ji'an to Hengyang is 23 yuan per person, and the train from Hengyang to Guilin, third class, is 5.50 yuan per person.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Wu Xiling: 1. For the route to Lantian in Anhua County, Hunan Province, please refer to the answer to "Mr. Yang Yang." After arriving in Hengyang, take the highway via Qiyang to Anhua. This section will cost about 10+ yuan.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Zhang: 1. The vaccination and smallpox certificate should be obtained from the Public Health Department of the Public Works Bureau six days before departure. 2. Luggage can be transported on the same passenger train from Haiphong to Hanoi. 3. From Hanoi to Nanning, take the train from Hanoi to Lang Son first (luggage up to three kilograms can be carried free of charge on this section). On the highway bus from Lang Son to Longzhou to Nanning, each person can carry 20 kilograms of free luggage.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Xi Leng: 1. The best way to go to Guiping, Guangxi, is to go through Haiphong. After arriving in Haiphong, take the train to Hanoi and then to Lang Son. From Lang Son, there is a highway via Longzhou and Nanning to Guiping. 2. The total cost is at least 150+ national currency (including meals and accommodation), and it takes 18 days. 3. Smallpox and vaccination injections can be done in advance, without waiting for the passport to arrive.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Wang Wenqi: 1. If you entrust our company to apply for a passport in Chongqing, it will take longer, about four to five weeks. The fee is eight national currency. If you entrust the application to Hong Kong, although the time is shorter, the fee is more expensive, costing eleven Hong Kong dollars per copy including the signature. 2. When passing through Vietnam, if you take a fourth-class train, you should prepare 20 Vietnamese dollars. The exchange rate for Vietnamese dollars in Shanghai is about 4.20 national currency per dollar.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Guo Zhijian: 1. If you have a service certificate, you can return to Shanghai from Ganzhou, Jiangxi, via Ningbo. You can take the highway from Ganzhou to Xingguo and then to Ningdu (this section will cost about 20+ yuan). For the route and travel expenses from Ningdu via Yingtan, Jinhua, Ningbo to Shanghai, please refer to the answer to "Mr. Yang Yang."</p>
<p>Answer to Ms. Huang Shulan: 1. There are French mail ships sailing directly from Shanghai to Marseille, France. The highest ticket price is 97 pounds, and the lowest is 42 pounds. 2. For procedures to go to France, you should first apply for an exit passport from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and you can purchase a ticket to depart after the passport is signed by the French Consulate.</p>

<h3>A Plea from Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>— (Yin Ran and 14 Others)</p>
<p>Oppose Increasing Tuition to Raise Salaries</p>
<p>Upon receiving a letter from a group of elementary school teachers, we also received an article by Mr. Yin Ran and others titled "Oppose Increasing Tuition to Raise Salaries." We indeed sympathize with the difficult lives of elementary school teachers, but increasing tuition to raise salaries is not a proper solution. Therefore, it is published here together. - Editor</p>
<p>The fall semester has begun, and many schools are preparing to open. At this time, many school teachers are requesting salary increases from the school authorities due to the high cost of living in the isolated island, which is insufficient to support a family. However, the school authorities say that their finances are tight, creating a difficult situation. Some people suggest increasing tuition to remedy the situation. This issue is worth discussing because it is not just a matter of teachers' livelihoods, but the development of the entire education sector. We, 14 elementary school teachers, are willing to express our honest opinions and ask the editor to grant us a small space to inform the public.</p>
<p>The number of elementary schools on the isolated island after the war is twice as many as before the war. Due to the complexity of the composition and background, tuition fees also vary greatly. The tuition fee for the senior grades in school A is often six or seven yuan, while the tuition fee for the senior grades in school B is 20 to 30 yuan. Although the income of the two schools is uneven, the treatment of teachers is the same. It goes without saying that the low income of school A affects the meager treatment of teachers, while the principal of school B sees the school as a business, only knows how to seek profit, and fills his personal pockets. On the one hand, he further lowers the treatment of teachers. In addition to calculating each semester as five months, there are also other harsh treatments with 80% or 90% discounts. As a result, how can teachers maintain the lives of several family members with a meager salary of 20 or 30 yuan per month, while the principal himself lives in high-rise buildings and indulges in entertainment venues, not knowing what "education" means. As for the problem that the meager treatment of our teachers is not enough to maintain a family life, it is definitely not possible to increase our salaries and get real benefits after increasing tuition fees. On the contrary, it will only make the principal's pockets more solid. The principal can't wait for the teachers to shout out the slogan of "increasing tuition fees to raise salaries," which is like a second landlord can't wait for the big landlord to shout "increase rent." But what is the result? It is still the general elementary school students who suffer. Due to the increase in tuition fees, their parents cannot afford it and have to drop out of school, causing batches of elementary school students to go to the out-of-school group. Isn't it a pity! Isn't this shaking the entire education sector and the future of the country? For the future of the country and the development of education, we vow not to increase tuition fees. We loudly shout "oppose increasing tuition fees to raise salaries."</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that enthusiastic people in society can provide us with a proper solution, and we hope that the principals can examine their conscience and run education well!</p>
<h3>Letter from a Group of Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>We are elementary school teachers. When we discovered that some of our difficult lives had been revealed in the article "Part of the Faculty and Staff Call for a Salary Increase" published on the 15th of your newspaper, we couldn't help but shed tears of emotion. In fact, there are more than thousands of people in the maritime education sector who are living the same life as us, and it is not just us who are so excited!</p>
<p>Indeed, the lives of our elementary school teachers are too bitter. They were bitter in ordinary times, even more bitter after the "August 13 Incident," but the degree of hardship after the recent foreign exchange drop and price surge has reached its highest point. In this situation, it is impossible for us to ask for a stable life. While we are shouting "kitten, white horse" to the students, we have to worry about firewood, rice, oil, and salt for today. How can this contradiction in life be unified? Save money! But the expenses of our elementary school teachers are not many, or even none; but we have to eat, we have to rent a house, and sometimes we have to add a piece or two of clothing (most school authorities think that the clothing is too shabby, which will affect the children's coming to school). As a result, the problem is still not solved. There are many people in society who lament the low level of students and the irresponsibility of teachers. These may all be facts, but they have overlooked another fact: teachers cannot be responsible when they are hungry and cold.</p>
<p>Because we want to do something with peace of mind, the movement to ask for a salary increase is always brewing, but it is only brewing. There has never been a day to formally express it to the school authorities. Everyone knows that there are many unemployed people in society now, and it is not difficult to replace a new batch of teachers; at the same time, when the whole country is sincerely united to overcome the national crisis, we should not cause any internal disputes that are enough to distract our strength. However, the threat to life is more severe than any threat, so many people have raised such a question: "Are we going to be elementary school teachers forever? Where is the destination of life?" Under such questions, teachers worry about their current lives every day, and always worry about their future prospects. As a result, the job of elementary school teacher has become a ladder for everyone to transfer to other jobs. In this way, what kind of situation will the future education sector form! This is indeed a serious crisis in the education sector! We say that this is a crisis in the education sector because although we may not be education-supremeists who "educate for education," we are particularly close to education and have particularly deep feelings. We have no power to solve this crisis, and we cannot bear to see this crisis continue to develop, so we respectfully ask the school authorities and people from all walks of life to issue a call to improve our lives!</p>
<p>We believe that our request to improve our lives is completely a legitimate request, and we also believe that this request can only be resolved perfectly if the school authorities and teachers proceed on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Based on this principle, we fully agree with the method proposed by more than 100 gentlemen, including Dai Yangren and Jin Jing, that "the school authorities should increase teachers' salaries by increasing tuition fees appropriately;" and propose that each school add voluntary classes, summer classes, economics classes, and remedial classes, and the education sector should establish a "Consumption Cooperative of Colleagues" (such a cooperative already exists, and the name is "Shanghai Elementary School Education Sector Consumption Cooperative") and a "Mutual Aid Association for the Livelihood of Faculty and Staff." Commercial circles can also help solve the problem by organizing a "Price Stabilization Association." We believe that this is not only a problem for our colleagues in the education sector, but also a problem for the entire education sector and the entire society. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life in society will express their opinions on this issue and jointly seek a quick and reasonable solution.</p>

<h3>Spring in the West</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Out West With The Hardys"</p>
<p>"Spring in the West" is the so-called Judge Hardy family film after "... Love... First Love" and "First Understanding of Love." In this family, the playwright created several typical characters: Judge Hardy (father), mother, Andrew (son), Mary (daughter), and Miley (aunt). However, as the main characters of each Judge Hardy film are Andrew and Mary, when the first two works were released, everyone pointed out that it was wrong to describe the love affairs of young daughters in a provocative manner, and its harm would be greater than other films that used pornography as a temptation. "Spring in the West" still takes the love affair of this pair of young daughters as the theme, but the playwright has corrected the mistakes of the past: For example, after Mary goes to the West, she falls in love with the shepherd Rhett Holt and asks her father to marry him. Hardy knows that it is a temporary emotional impulse of his daughter and only allows them to have a trial marriage first, so that they can gradually discover their own or each other's shortcomings in the common life of the trial, so as to avoid regret. This rational judgment -- instructing children to use the correct meaning of love, should be the merit of this Judge Hardy family film compared to the former.</p>
<p>Because the Judge Hardy family film is a box office success, MGM has fixed the "cast list" of this family: father (Lewis Stone), mother (Fay Holden), son (Mickey Rooney), daughter (Cecilia Parker), and aunt (Ann Rutherford). Among these five actors, Mickey Rooney is currently the most popular child star in Hollywood, so the directors of the Judge Hardy films have focused their efforts on him, and this "Spring in the West" is no exception.</p>
<p>For example, the following examples show Mickey Rooney's decadent and strong personality: (1) Mickey Rooney changed all his clothes, hoping to become a equestrian, and saw the shepherd walking with his legs bent, he also imitated, but when he rode on the horse, he fell terribly: (2) He stole to the pasture to ride a horse and put a rope on the front legs of "Calico" (horse name), but when he galloped, the man and horse turned over; (3) He gambled with Jackie (an eight-year-old western girl) on marksmanship, and Jackie shot a tin can into the air with five shots in a row, scaring Mickey Rooney to run away. The above scenes are all handled very vividly and interestingly, and clearly portray Mickey Rooney's personality.</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney's acting skills, from "Orphans' Paradise" to now, whether it is his facial expressions or actions, have been stereotyped, at least there is no new development; but his period as a child star is very short, which is detrimental to his future.</p>
<p>Here is also a discovery of an excellent child star, that is, Virginia Weidler, who plays Jackie. Her innocence, liveliness, sadness, and happiness are not artificial or pretentious, which is rare.</p>
<p>Lewis Stone, Fay Holden, and Cecilia Parker are all qualified.</p>
