<p>社評</p>
<h3>貨幣戰爭</h3>
<p>自香港方面，對於上海外滙黑市，限制供給；自華北方面，儘量將華北地者法幣向上海塞；上海金融市塲經此南北交流，於是引起巨大變動。近數日來，變動又入靜態；據匯豐銀行掛牌，國幣一元合英金四便士，國幣百元合美金七元七五，漸决形成新水準。同時國民政府負責當局又切實聲明，將極力維持法幣政策。此後市塲的情形，當可戰時趨於平靜。</p>
<p>這此華北地名法幣大量流入上海，表面上爲少數投機商人，利用津滬兩地匯水的差異，企圖從中獲得巨額的非法利潤；其實這却是中日貨幣戰爭中的又一慕。因爲在嚴厲統制下的華北，誰能擁有多餘的大量法幣？誰能大量的運輸出口？這更顯明的是一種有計劃有後盾的行動；究其用意，一方面巧取豪奪吸收法幣，圖以套取外滙，一方面减少了法幣的流通量，推廣它的籌碼。</p>
<p>至於今後，可以預料得到的，在各淪陷區域中日貨幣戰爭沒有終止以前，上海以及其他獲得貨幣控制權的，勢必繼續設法破壞法幣的信用；同時套取法幣的外匯基金；而實施法幣政策的中國，亦必盡力以維護法幣制度的完整健全。那麼今後的中日貨幣戰爭，或將隨着時問的延續而愈益激烈。居留在上海及其他淪陷區域的中國人民，對於貨幣戰爭的眞相，必須有澈底的認識，纔能減輕個人經濟上的損失，並不致損害國族抗戰的力量。</p>
<p>中國所發行的法幣，據估計本月初的流通額，的爲二十萬萬元；一部分流通在中國政府統制下的內地，一部分則分佈在各淪陷區域。流通中國內地的法幣，其價格絲毫沒有變動；人民所需要的合法外匯，可由政府按照法定價格供給。至於分佈在各淪陷區的法幣，亦即目前貨幣戰爭中的目的物。這一部分法幣，日本可以用政治經濟和軍事的力量，直接加以壓迫；而中國政府却祇能問接予以維持；允其中國因種種關係而不能迅速取締的外匯黑市，這是招引對方進攻的一個最大弱點。淪陷區域的法幣，雖在這種環境之下，但仍爲各地人民所信任；不僅是現在廣大的淪陷區域人民，視爲唯一的信用工具；就是在日軍直接强令禁用法幣的城市，也不能遏止牠暗中的流通。可見法幣實具有不易為人所破壞的堅强基礎！</p>
<p>經過了相當時期的貨幣戰爭，反證了法幣的「源遠流長」、於是日方遷怒於第三國的帮助。其實一種貨幣的流通，必須有合法政治力量以爲推行，和充分的發行準備，以爲基礎，纔能取得人民的信任，纔能成爲普遍的通貨，決非，單純的槍桿所能爲力的。借重槍桿，則其功能祇如槍彈的射程，過了射程，一切無效了！軍用票之外，不得不另用名義，另印籌碼，這種事實的經過，說明了槍彈射程的眞理。但毫無發行準備的名義與花紙，亦無立足餘地，故當初它們的北方籌碼偽鈔曾揚言係以日元爲準備，可是日元準備的黃金白銀，大部分已運到美國，換了鋼鐵了；連日本認爲經濟命脈的紡織業，其所需要的原料羊毛與棉花，尙不易取得外匯，那裏還能供給僞鈔的外滙。於是它們的虹口籌碼揚言以中國法幣爲準備，這是套取法幣外滙基金的毒計；不料中國使外滙黑市暴跌的策略，不但使它們的籌碼無所附麗，弱點畢露：並且因此而使它們在淪陷區獨佔的商業亦受了致命的打擊！</p>
<p>貨幣戰爭方興未艾，必然愈戰愈烈。在未來的貨幣戰爭中，中國方面爲追求最後的勝利，必須中國政府與人民都較以前更切實的執行各自的義務，中國政府必須迅速加强統制貿易，減少入超，免致外滙基金多所耗損；又必須向各國友邦繼續取得金融的援助。援助的多寡不是問題，而其主要意義：乃在證明法幣在國際有取得援助的資格；乃在證明貨幣戰爭之中，法幣獨得援助，亦即獨有信用。此外，更須以敏捷而有效的方法，使法幣大最流向內地。在人民方面，則必須堅定對法幣的信念，認明法幣有獨一無二的信用；幷且理解若要避免在貨幣戰爭時遭受經濟的損失「，則祇有將資金移往內地，從事各種資源的開發，纔是最安全的上策。</p>
<p>英國對日妥洽</p>
<h3>外部發表文吿　對英表示失望　英承認日要求殊堪扼腕　渝聯合日報痛斥英態度</h3>
<p>（重慶）外交部發言人今日發表文吿、表示中政府對東京會議中英政府態度之失望、該女吿稱、中國當局在得悉英日方案之內容時、不能掩飾其對英政府所取態度之失望、日軍在華之侵略、乃英國自身與國聯其他會員國一致宜佈者、今英政府兌覺有承認在華日軍所謂特殊要求之適宜、此誠極堪扼腕者、尙可驚異者、英政府竟擔任通知在華英國官憲與人民、勿作妨碍日軍達其目的之任何行動或計畫、然張伯倫在下院所發英政府政策不能由他國指揮而轉變、以及保證東京之發展、並不含有英國前此始終實行的在華政策之任何改變等語、中政府聞之、尙爲滿意、英政府在國聯各項決議案下、所給予不得採取任何行爲、致挫弱中國抗戰力而增加中國作戰的困難以及竭力援助中國之保證、言猶在耳、殆無促請英政府勿忘此項保蹬之需要、中政府深信英日方案之宣佈、刻雖引起疑慮、然英政府將取符合其法律上及道德上對華義務之態度、以處理所謂天津地方事件而以行動表示其對於日人在華造成局勢的政策之堅決、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）今晨此間聯合日報著論痛斥英國在東京會議中所持之態度、該報刋登英日妥協之全文、及英首相張伯倫與外相哈立法克斯對此事所發之言論、並加以分析云、「吾人對於意義廣泛之名詞、如「在華日軍之特殊的需要」之類、殊不敢驟下定義、日軍在中國所希望達到之目的、英人知之審矣、如英國對於侵略或暴行、竟予以援助及便利、則英政府至少已不復有道德之原則或公理之概念、譬諸有强人刦吾家室、殺吾衆人、其時忽有鄰人出而語盜曰、余已注意爾等之特殊需要、並擔任阻止被刦者之家屬出而干涉爾等之行動云云、試問吾人對此鄰人、將作何感想耶、中國對於張伯倫言論之反響、亦猶是耳、假使此鄰人在法律上無援助吾人之義務而竟予强人以鼓勵、但同時又宣稱、渠並未變更其善視鄰人之政策、則吾人反響又將如何、况國聯一日未吿解體、共所通過之決議、卽一日不能視爲廢紙、吾人希望當吾人偶一憶及國聯屢决通過皆有英國參加其問、並允予以支持之決議時、吾人並非作白盡之夢、夫對華作有效之援助、與對在華日軍之目的、不作妨碍之行動、二者實彼此衝突、英國此種態度、不但削减中國之抗戰力量、而增加其困難、且更造成國際局勢之糾紛與困難、吾人希望張伯倫所發宣言、並不含有英國對華政策變更之意一語、係由衷之言、吾人固不疑共誠意、惟其誠意必須以其在東京正式會議之態度及其確實之行爲證明之」云、該報結論贊助蔣委員長請全國自行努力、勿倚賴他人之演詞、又中國政府某員語人曰、「英國友人有邀余赴宴者、余不能應共請」云、觀之卽可窺見此間華人情緒之一斑矣、（二十六日路透社電）</p>

<p>張伯倫別另有見解</p>
<h3>英法蘇同盟　前途暗淡　叔棣　英外相以去就力爭無效　張伯倫堅拒邱吉爾人閣</h3>
<p>倫教航訊，這世上因着立塲和利害的不同，因而，對於當前進行着英法蘇同盟的進行，就有的在促進着，形成了推動的力，有的却在阻碍着，形成了逆流的力，這兩方面的力量，都是多端的，一時自然說不盡，這裹要說的，是指着當前的歐洲方面阻止道一同盟成立的最主要的力量。</p>
<p>這力，却又是「張伯倫內閣！」</p>
<p>這一年來指摘「張伯倫內閣的」調子似乎唱得太高了，太多了，因而，有些好心腸的人們，反漸漸地，懷疑到這些指摘的是不是可信，指摘者們的本身，是不是別有偏見和用心。其實呢，照實際形勢的演變判斷，這裹任何較有眼光的觀察家都同意，一年以來指摘「張伯倫內閣」的力量，祇有太嫌微弱和不够，而還沒有絲毫過火的地方。眼前這進行了好幾個月而毫無具體成就的英法蘇同盟就是一個最恰當例證。</p>
<p>說起來也許有人不信吧，不過，鐵一般的無情事實，却是直到目前寫着這通訊時，這一九三九年七月十四為止，張伯倫首相，還在堅持着他的所謂「綏靖」政策絲毫不肯，認錯。這些天來，連英國一些素以「死硬派」著名的人士，也都認淸了英國當前的危機，認淸了除了英，法，蘇同盟外，英國外交毫無其他出路，然而，當他們把這覺悟後的意見，又向張伯倫去轉說時，却遭到他的堅決拒絕。於是失望之餘的，這些覺悟的「死硬派」人士，就不得不被迫得到一個結論：「張伯倫內閣。巳經毫無救藥了。」所以，兩個禮拜以前，這些人們的口號，還是改組和調整現內閣，現在呢，連他們最大的希望，也不得不寄在下屆大選上去，而向着推翻現內閣的路錢上行進了。</p>
<p>目前張伯倫一流人物反對英，法，蘇同盟的藉口，是什麼呢？據我在此地所知，這兩天來，他們放在嘴上决數最多的，不外乎這幾項：（一）未來蘇聯對英法在軍事上的便值，充其極，祇是純粹「防禦的，」而絕無積極作用，所以「為了這實在不值得再去和史丹林同志斤斤較量了。」（二）蘇俄未來的作用；我們最希望的，不是僅僅在於供給軍火給波蘭麼，那末，好了，現在這樣子已經够了，何必再去仰蘇俄的「鼻息」。（三）担保波羅的海沿岸各國獨立與完整的事，如果當事國本身不願接受祖保的話，那末英國是「絕對不能自動担保的，」為什麽呢，張伯倫說：「這是干涉別國的內政呀，我們以同一理由責備過希特拉的，現在我們自己常然不能再犯」等。</p>
<p>作為反對英，法，蘇同盟這樣重大事件的理由看，這些表面藉口的脆弱性，是一望而知的。所以這些天來，在英國從正面和張伯倫一流人物辯論的事，似乎已不大聽到了。現在的問題，明白而又簡單地擺在全英國人的面前：（一）「張伯倫內閣」是不是可以改變路綫，對這，張伯倫堅絕地回答過了：「不」那末接下去。（二）是不是可以改組現內閣，以達到改變外交路綫的目的，這一計劃，又碰到了張伯倫首相的根本拒絕改組。於是就來了第（三）個問題，是不是可以按期舉行大選，改善現狀。</p>
<p>這三個一貫下來的間題，是歸納了事實後所得的對於趨勢的大概說明。在道裹，我想再簡單地述幾件具體事實。</p>
<p>指揮當前英國外交的核心，是在於英內閣中的所謂一裹內閣」「裹內閣」的組成，在現在，一共有四個巨頭，張伯倫首相，西門財相，賀爾內相，哈立法克斯外相。如果我們認爲英現內閣近來是曾經多多少少地予過大家以「改變路綫可能性」的希望的話，那末，這一綫希望的發源，是出自外相哈立法克斯，可是哈立法克斯的主張，走到對波同盟，對土同盟，對羅對希担保後，在對蘇談判上，却受到了一個挫頓。但是，即使在現在，如果讓哈立法克斯放手做下去的話，那末，在經過了相當的廻環曲折後，英，法，蘇同盟，大槪仍會終於成立的。然而，就在這時，利用了暫時的挫頓，西門，賀爾這兩位，却儘量地向哈立法克斯揶揄起來。而允其反對英蘇接近的，却是這位西門財相。所以，哈立法克斯一直算是在「裏內閣」孤軍奮鬥，他的奧援，却在於大多數閣員裹，及廣大的英國羣衆。</p>
<p>據說哈立法克斯對於這决自己的主張，是以去就　孤注一擲的，換句話說，萬一他的主張不克實現，那末，他是打算辭去他的外相位置的。但照目前英國所謂「裹內閣」裏的空氣判斷，他的主張，絕難順利實現，大概最多的限度，如能做到阻止張伯倫「綏靖」政策的再演，已經算是很好的了。</p>
<p>四月初起到六月底，經過了將近三個月的，哈立法克斯在內閣裹孤軍奮鬥的結果，大家知道，要想現在內閣根本改變路錢，是小可能的了。於是，六月下句左右，在英國就突然湧起了改組現內閣的聲浪。初起時的擬議，是邱吉爾，艾登，及前任海相的古柏三人的同時人閣，後來，為了作為一個事先的佈置，哈立法克斯就代艾登與張伯倫間，安排了一個會晤。那時，艾登剛剛從法國走了一趟回來，他的意見裹，也同時充滿了法國領袖人士們對於夾，法，蘇同盟的意見。道一决會晤的結果，大概並不佳妙，因為自那時後，艾登入閣呼聲，忽然沉寂了下去。</p>
<p>這樣子，一直到前兩個禮拜的時候，就忽然別爆發了一個集中擁護邱吉爾進閣的運動。</p>
<p>這一次擁護邱吉爾運動的力量，可以說是空前的集中和蓬勃。除去英國廣大的羣衆不待說外，幾乎全英國的報紙和與論機關都在作著大聲疾呼。哈立法克斯不用說，連本身也有進閣希望的艾登及古柏，也都暫時放棄了自己政治生涯的努力，而公然站出來，同聲擁護邱吉爾進閣。國會裹大多數議員，是站在邱吉爾道一面的，連那位「克立夫頓集團」的女東道主，亞斯托爾夫人也是「自有史以來」第一决地，站了出來，贊同請邱吉爾進閣。在這一切的側面，又動員了美，法兩國所有的輿論，邱吉爾在電影院裹，在廣告上，在無錢電裹，在國會裹，到處響着這一個字。</p>
<p>可是，兩個禮拜了，現在，這一運動的成績如何呢？就是前兩天，有人向張伯倫提出讓邱吉爾接替史丹荷普為海相時，張伯倫立刻就予以拒絕。</p>
<p>「爲什麽」，據說張伯倫是勃然大怒地反駁着，「我絕不會自殺去，終結我個人政治生命的，我請他來在內閣裹面醞釀一個倒閣運動」？</p>
<p>比喻地說起來，擁護邱吉爾進閣的運動，目前，正在像一個奔騰澎湃的洪流，在洶湧着，而那個「張伯倫內閣」，却一座孤礁似的，屹立在巨浪的漩窩裹，抗拒着四面八方發來的衝擊。</p>
<p>不過，兩個禮拜的教訓，到底令英國一般人士們得了一個結論，今後的唯一的挽救，祇有繫之於大規模的倒閣運動。因而，把希望新寄託在下屆大選上去了。</p>
<p>所以，最近蘇聯駐法大使蘇利茲會在一個地方向許多人說：「在張伯倫首相在位的期間內，英，蘇的同盟，恐怕是很難迅速成立，而祇是這麽延怠下去的」。想起來，是很有道理的話。</p>
<p>剩下來的間題，就是英國本年十一月的大選，是不是會按期舉行。</p>
<p>照現在的情形，大選大概是打算按期舉行的。在朝在野的各方，都在作着大選的準備。然而，這裹還有一個危險，就是萬一張伯倫屆時認為舉行不利的話，（他自己早已是打算退休了，成為間題的，是他的左右一流人物）。那末，也許會臨時來個延期，也很不好說。萬一那樣的話，英國的倒閣運動，可眞個就是需要作更大的努力。</p>

<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<h3>為什麽愛情　會變黑暗與痛苦？</h3>
<p>無人不知男女間的性愛生活，是充滿無限的光明，及無比的快樂，但若身體失健，致有愛的缺點的話，則此種光明與快樂，立刻變為黑暗與痛苦，允其是男子，在進行愛的生活時差不多隨身體的強弱，而決定其幸福與吾，就是他的妻子的憂樂也未嘗不視夫的體力，為之轉移，</p>
<p>要側量自身的精力強弱只要視生殖工作是吾健康，還有局部的反應是吾萎弱，此外在喜劇後若感覺骨節酸軟，全身的疲勞，直至翌日尚未恢復者，道都係身體衰弱的明証。</p>
<p>一個玲瓏活潑而又多情的少女，不幸而嫁給這種丈夫，因為不能獲得愛的樂趣，對丈夫深抱不滿，雙方愛情漸趨冷淡，直至决裂而後巳，在法庭上我們有不時聽見這種離異的申訴，這並非作者向壁虛搆。</p>
<p>假使丈夫的衰弱繼續不已，他們必須積極加以研究，以便看看是吾有治好的希望，舉凡足以促進健康的方法，必須一一照辦，如短期禁慾，慎重飲食，注意運動，避免操勞，然後再施以對症的療法，本有不立刻恢復健康的。</p>
<p>促成衰弱的原因素多，最普遍者，由于遺精，滑精之故，致使主宰性力的靑春腺大受斵傷，然欲使此靑春腺重復繁榮，澈底治療上述各症者，應積極服以睪丸內分泌劑男用「補體康」，該劑為內分泌劑之最佳者，它能增進全身營養，振作已衰的精力，助長發育，補腦，補腎，一小時藥力開始，廿四小時即生精補腎，故服後决無失望之虞，生殖的工作雖屬夫婦應盡的責任，但若過於放縱，反有害而無益，色慾過度可以減弱男子的精力，同時也使婦人疲敝，故凡縱慾的人，機能之活動亦必低落，為預防早衰，如以「補體康」補之，頗有卓效。其女用「補體康」功能調經種子。</p>

<h3>精神疲勞的補救</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>精神疲勞，在暑天最易感覺得到。本來我人之精神，如果工作不十分過度，始終可以保持常態。惟是一般人之工作，超過其本來的工作時間，不去休息，那麼他的身上就容易產生一種疲勞的毒素，而人覺得很疲勞了。這是疲勞的原因。</p>
<p>不過這是一般普通人的情形，有許多稟賦過人的人，他們的耐勞力耍強過平常的人很多，而反轉來說，身體素形虛弱的人，就是不做過分的工作，也易感到厭倦。</p>
<p>凡是精神易感疲勞的人，他的神經也必很容易感到衰弱，頭腦脹痛，遇事生厭，且對於工作，異常厭惡。神經銳敏，故又易入悲觀之送，凡此患者之人生眞正趣味，旣不得嘗，其事業亦不能有何成就。患者允其在暑天時益感難受，蓋在暑天時，此等纖弱之身，食慾復為不振，於是營養益感不給，身體益感不支矣。</p>
<p>耍補救此等精神疲勞，精神散漫，不能集中，只有服用德國「補體康」，此劑係用靑春腺為原料復在紫光電下，以科學方製成，故不失原來新鮮活潑之靑春活力。服後能昂奮精神，促進食慾，允其可以助長靑春腺之發育，增進腦力，集中思考力，記憶力，夏天服之，身體不倦，增進工作效率，頭目淸快，至對於性神經衰，日自凟，房事過度等，而致陰萎遺精，早洩等，「補體康」一藥，更有超凡入聖之效力。因之各國醫家對「補體康」在臨床上之印象極佳。</p>
<h3>最新治肺聖藥</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>關於肺病的療法甚多，而苦無一特效藥可以根治，自古以來。此不幸之肺病患者，乃不知多少人犧牲於無特效藥一語之下。近因科學發達，醫藥學均呈突飛猛進之勢，而肺病治療法。也有長足之進展。「補肺拿爾」一藥。即受科學之推動力而發明者，此劑證明對於各期肺病，有短期奏效之功，並可使肺部空洞部份逐漸縮小，以至平伏如恒，因此「補肺拿爾」遂推為肺病內服藥中之祭酒。確非過譽之言，其在未成癆病之前各種咳嗽。服「補肺拿爾」後三小時內即可鎮咳止嗽。</p>
<h3>遺精治愈例　淫書淫畫所造成的惡果</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>

<p>淋病新語</p>
<h3>尿道淋之前因後果</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>一染淋病，其初之淋菌，類多寄生於前尿道，此時如果以迅雷不及掩耳之法，將淋菌加以掃蕩，則未獲據點之淋菌，自無從掙扎，而一網打盡，惟是，如果此時而不極力消滅此種病菌，則一切病變均由此而起。大抵前尿道之淋菌，淋病之前驅期中常見之。及由前驅而入急性期，則淋菌已不侷促于前尿道而且跨入後尿道，一切變症，更見增多，而治療上亦較前驅症爲難。淋菌在前尿道所發生之淋病，其易扑滅之原因。爲因前尿道生理上無複雜的搆造。所以治療起來，很是容易，如過淋菌已侵入後尿道，治療上雖較難，但如其淋菌尚未侵襲泌尿器系，內生殖器系，血液循環系。根治猶不甚難。但如果已成淋毒性膀胱炎，攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，關節炎等症，是無異表明患者之淋病已侵入此等系統。其治療上不但較前尿道炎爲難，即後尿道炎亦困難多矣。凡此等等，都是淋毒尿道炎失治之前因後果。而惟一之療法，祗有服用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」始有肅淸之望。因淋菌如其自前尿道，迄分散三大系統之淋菌，範圍廣大，絶對不能用一枝一節之局部手術，可以完成驅淋之任務也。余更輔用德國静電療法，使「克淋儂」殺菌力尤能發揮盡致　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每日送診廿號。每號僅取號金五角並送價值一元之「性病全書」一册</p>

<p>重要生命綫、現在表面上各輸仍停泊汕頭、但實際上均已停止進口、至於泉州雖英輪仍派輪行駛、但於一週或一週內始有一班、廈門已為淪陷區域、貨運及客運、均極稀少、英商太古怡和等公司、除勉強維持中國南北洋各主要航錢外、多</p>
<p>改航廣州灣海防邏羅等南海航綫、以廣州灣而言、除太古怡和兩公司輪船外、為和發成代理之陳平太平洋、德忌士之海澄、長安之長安、大有之永成永和永華、順昌代理之大寶石、捷順代理之聯通潮州、平均每日至少有兩艘、往來香港至廣州灣、至航行</p>

<h3>兌換風潮平息　法幣價值增高　政府全力維持已收明效　津魯漢鈔票多滙入內地</h3>
<p>財政部對於法幣價值、決以全力維持後、關於淪陷區域之法幣、亦有充分之準備、法幣之發行政策謹慎、準備現金、始終在百分之六十以上、津魯漢地名之鈔票、規定收兌辦法後、上海之兌換風潮、業已平息而滙款人內地者激增、同時各銀行亦設法將資金移入內地、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>兌換風潮　完全平息</p>
<p>上海各行莊拒收津魯漢外埠地名之鈔票後、持券人粉向中國·交通·兩銀行請求兌換、自經中交兩行規定收兌辦法後、各持津魯漢地名鈔票者、均改向各銀行請求匯入內地、銀行方面對於匯水、一律免收、於是昨日向中交兩行請求滙款至內地者激增、關於津魯漢以外之地名鈔票、市上十足照常通用、故兌換風潮、完全平息、市塲謠言已無、人心安定、</p>
<p>鼓勵資金　移入內地</p>
<p>上海因資金集中、以致有過剩之慮、市塲上發生不正當之投機營業、如外匯之套利、外幣黃金股票之買賣、以及各種商品之囤積、地產房屋之租造、現各銀行為杜絕投機、防止物價飛漲、影響民生計、對於貨物等抵押放款、從嚴辦理、並設法將過剩之資金、移入內地、協助政府開發西南西北之富源、以符戰時之金融政策、此外並鼓勵人民匯款入內地、並不收滙費、</p>
<p>行莊存款　已見增加</p>
<p>上海各銀行錢莊、於上月初曾發生提存風潮、自財政部馬電限制後、始告平息、最近因金融市塲巳趨穩定、銀行錢莊之組織、益臻健全、於是各存戶將以前提出之款、重復存入各行莊、因此各行莊之新存款增加、對於政府之安定金融辦法、已有深切了解、而存戶均不願提取、因存在行莊之款均有利息、活期至少亦有四厘、</p>
<h3>興化口外南日島　日軍登陸未逞</h3>

<p>設法交涉　各地禁運</p>
<p>昨日米市塲交易情形依然混亂、、白粳早薄稻客尖等貨、均未出樣、僅白元冬霜羊尖糙尖四種有成交、總的五六千包而已、中决各米均巳開至頂盤、並發生有暗盤交易情事、自久大米店經理因超越限價、為法捕房拘捕究辦後、市塲投機者稍有戒心、預料今晨起、米價或可稍趨穩定、又新聲社記者昨晤米業某領袖、據談今蕪湖無錫常州等、均已先後禁米出境、以致上述地方之米、運滬絕跡、但松江一帶之米、仍可運滬、咋日的運到一千包、關於禁運之地、現正設法交涉中、</p>
<p>市塲公告　恪遵限價</p>
<p>豆米市塲管理委員會、在市塲發貼第七十七號公告云、查特區當局限制米價、早經本會通告週知遵照在案、今再重申前案、決議凡河下無袋過斛新鮮白粳、每石不得超過十九元七角、縮决者十九元五角、餘貨應依决照別、希各自重遵守、倘敢故違、發生意外、咎由自取、本會不負任何責任也、再慎重公告、務希行客一體週知、此佈、</p>

<h3>金融　外埠鈔票雖說用　市上仍未盡流通　中農地名券一概通用</h3>
<p>本報賽於持有外埠地名之鈔票人困難情形，先後有所記述，昨日各報新聞中見有中中交三行所接收之各商業銀行外埠地名鈔票，照常收用之聲明，但據調查所得，各商店仍不肯收受，詢之以故，則云「解銀行，銀行不收，吾儕亦只有不收」，並謂「報紙新聞，近來多作欺人之談，不可盡信」，此則誠大可慮，蓋現在無論何種事業，甚至於投機操縱，亦多自說自作，如米業儘管壟斷居奇，還口口聲聲說維持民食，又如華北地名鈔票及漢口鈔票拒用之後，可免費滙往各該地方，獨不念持有此項鈔票者，皆為上海之居民，能有幾人，需要滙款至天津山東濟南靑島漢口各地，則大多數人持有之華北及漢口鈔票，旣不能兌換又無從滙兌，當然由一般投機商出而收買此項鈔票，大貶其價，用以牟利，現聞華北鈔票，某銀行巳有行市，每一千四百元可兌法幣一千元，漢口鈔每一千二百元可兌法幣一千元，質言之，持有華北鈔，照票面打六折，漢鈔打八折，故各銀行為其營業前途計，為安定人心計，為招徠存款計，對於外埠地名之鈔票，應有正當明顯之表示，不宜再用新聞政策，此項鈔票，用與不用，應由各該銀行或銀行公會正式在報章登載公告，則人心知所適從矣。</p>
<p>自津魯漢地名各鈔票停止流通後，市民商店對中國農民銀行之地名券，亦多拒不敢收，經詢之該行，據云一無論杭州、漢口、西安、福州、蘭州等地名及湖北省銀行改中國農民銀行等券，早經概作無地名諭，故照常一律通用，無論何日，可持向霞飛路馬斯南路該行無限制掉換，本埠各銀行錢莊亦一律收用，」然市上商店，有照收，有仍拒，詢之，亦為有銀行不收之故，允以湖北省銀行十元五元之改名票，因有「憑票向漢口總行兌國幣〇圓」字樣，商店之怕麻煩者多不肯收用，甚至一元票亦不肯用，某君有一「蘭州」地名中農一元票，竟無從用去，可見人心顧慮之深矣。</p>
<h3>外匯掉期交易頗旺　傳平準會不維持黑市　英美匯緊縮尚不甚巨</h3>
<p>外滙咋日市况、匯豐掛牌、仍悉無上落、英美匯暗市、因英美間互滙突然回縮、致晨開即告英平美軟、開後因洋行界結款殷繁、且英行滙豐供意極淡、而吸力殊佳、加以投機商仍績有扒結、時市上忽有平準基金委員會、將不再維持淪陷區域外滙、聽其自然伸縮、及滙豐巳停止供給等謠傳、致潛勢頗緊、計英金一度退為四辦士三五、美滙因曾軟至八元二五、嗣以外行賣意轉濃、故市勢頗鬆、午刻英金會回硬至四辦士三七五、美匯亦回上至八元半、延至午收為狀又稍帶軟、英金以四辦十三四三七五、美滙八元四三七五收盤、結果英緊一五六二五、美軟三七五、中途掉期頗多、因本月期交割在即、多方受銀根緊縮、及貼現高昂之縛束、若不了結、祇得掉期、故七八月掉期愈形拔開、七月與八月英金距離半辦士、美匯相差一元、的合月息（除佣）一角二分光景、聞有利華比與某美行等、因有巨額法幣用途、故貼出居多、半天交易尚旺、至港滙市勢頗軟、賣價已破入三十一元關內、</p>
<p>掉期套息一角二分</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期縮一八七五、遠期降一二五、紐的銀價呆定、倫敦生金回大半辦士、滙兌英對美跌七毫、對滬小〇六二五、對法仍平、美對英縮〇六五、對滬未更、對法降〇六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士半、美滙八元七五、較前收英平美緊〇六二五、乃英美間滙率同縮之故、開後洋行雖扒、但外行除滙豐外、尚有供意、且港電與西商沙遜亦稍來吐售、故缺乏變化、計洋行首先結進麥加利現貨英金四辦士半、並扒結某行現貨美匯八元七五、時港電與沙遜會吐予滙豐現貨英金四辦士牛、繼而英行有利吸進外商八月份英金四辦士、迨滙豐掛脾揭曉、仍悉無上落、及白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免微、此後外電雖塞、無如外行吃胃頗健、加以投機商亦有扒進、故市勢步軟、計外行有利等及投機商吸進外電與某銀公司現貨美滙由八元半、縮至三七五、後英金最軟竟喊過四辦士二五、美匯最緊呌過八元二五、嗣後扒風稍戢、且外行如東方等賣意轉濃、故價亦逐漸回鬆、計東方塞予同行現貨英金四辦士三四三七五、繼而外行互做現貨美滙八元三七五、時外行因需要大宗法幣、故掉期頗肯貼出、因之利率愈大、的貼出月息一角一分半及一角二分、均由日行與沙遜及華商等貼進、將近午刻、某行塞予投機家現貨夾金四辦士三七五、及現貨美匯八元半、其時聞港滙銀行現貨賣價已軟至三十元〇六二五，延至午收銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士三四三七五、美滙八元四三七五、結果比上日晚收、英緊一五六二五、美軟三七五、港滙亦縮六二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港申匯升十五元</p>
<p>香港二十六日電、今日滙市平靜、英美申日各滙、與昨收比較、均告不動、十時十五分申滙升十八元、為三百三十三元、十一時三十分不動、午收申滙回降三元、為三百三十元、比昨收見升十五元、</p>

<p>天津二十六日電、今日滙市鬆動、對英鬆二一八七五、對美鬆四三七五、巾滙小二元、「聯鈔」暗盤微昂七角五、</p>
<h3>變幻正多　金價奔騰　高盤為三八五零元　成交一千五百餘兩</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、續趨高昂、潑風甚熾、結果又飛升一百二十五元、惟中途起伏依然浩大、使人殊難捉摸、此種情况、完全一般投機商操蹤之故、全日潛勢大致先猛漲、繼暴落而後再漲、初開承上日之餘風未息、再以外匯報緊、人心愈堅、一般業外買戶亦紛至沓來、至於捏貨之戶、看漲觀念極濃、雖有利可獲、但仍不肯脫手以圖厚利、致市勢遂扶搖直上、十時許竟昂達三千八百五十元高峯、嗣以外匯回鬆、浮多出籠之念、油然而生、其時現金號與銀樓帮亦套賣較殷、加以買方在回跌時亦未敢加碼、遂急轉直下、一度會退達三千七百十八元低盤、午刻因聞外匯又稍轉緊、買風再激起、午收已回上至三千七百六十元、午後同業外搜羅愈力、證券帮亦續來猛進、再升達三千八百元大關、晚收為三千七百九十五元、交易尚旺、全日的一千五百餘兩、銀樓飾金亦頗多變幻、結果掛高十五元、海關金仍平、中英純金等復向上昇、</p>
<p>烚赤漲一二五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開買氣頗濃、九時三十五分、開市即做高三十元、證券帮進銀樓帮五十兩、價三千七百元、開後買氣愈濃、證券帮與錢兌業爭前猛進不休、加以外匯步緊、致售者扳價益力、瞬息飛騰七十元、證券帮進錢兌業五十兩、價三千七百七十元、剛一度稍回、銀樓幫售予金號廿兩、價三千七百五十元、此後聞外匯緊勢更厲、故殷富託錢兌業等代為羅購、漲勢之熾、猶如怒馬奔騰、竟又飛升百元、金號進銀樓帮五十兩、價三千八百五十元為當日高峯、但至十時後突然反動傾瀉、蓋外匯止緊趨鬆、賣者頓見活躍、加以漲勢過銳、在回跌之際、買方咸具戒心、回跌亦勁、不久竟暴落一百三十二元、錢兌業賣予金號五十兩、價三千七百十八元、將近午刻聞外匯父稍帶軟、錢兌業復來吸收、遂回高四十二元、錢兌業互做二十兩、三千七百六十元為午收價、午後市勢堅俏、開市即高十元、金號進錢兌業五十兩、價三千七百七十元、此後殷富又委託證券帮及錢兌業力吸、價遂重昂三十元、錢兌業互做五十兩、價三千八百元、三時十五分錢兌業又互做四十兩、價三千七百九十五元為晚收價、結果比上日又猛漲一百二十五元、聞收後買方三千八百元有納胃、全天一百五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢鮮有成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛高十五元</p>

<h3>美金鎊　九十五元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、因外匯趨軟、烚赤上漲劇烈、且政府對黑市外匯有不維持說、人心虛弱、市况甚堅、下午烚赤高漲愈烈、一般經濟寬裕者、爭購英美金鎊、英美金票、終以市間稀少、未能暢購為憾、日金票需要煩殷、市况堅俏、晚市為一元一角六分、朝鮮票供給稀少、亦趨昂貴、晚市為九角五分、公會交易頗盛、鎮興出祥泰進美金票二百元、寶祥出勤泰進美金票一百元、又出隆昌進美金票四百元、又出福和祥進法郎票三千個、祥康出森泰進英金票三十鎊、祥泰出福和祥進法郎票二千個、昨日市價、英金鎊升一元一角、英金票升一元叫角、美金鎊升三元、美金票升五角八分、香港票升一角二分、法郎票升一分五厘、新加坡·荷蘭·安南·斐律濱票、俱升一角、坎拿大票升四角、其他各幣未更、</p>

<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、當日巳見轉定、每千元終日盤旋於二百卅元之間、較前日復昂起十元、錢業公會拆息、突然高起四分、早午兩市均掛二角云、</p>
<h3>英印銀價　一致降縮</h3>
<p>二十五日倫敦電、銀市印度及美商買進賣出、低價時有人　空、南况平疲、收盤後市面平呆、印度照掛牌價稍來供售、大條銀近期縮一八七五、遠期降一二五、紐的銀電、美銀價仍呆定、又孟買銀電、印銀情勢疲軟、現貨與八月均跌九安那、九月亦小十安那、成交單共計百張云、</p>
<h3>論法幣之前途</h3>
<p>抗戰以來，中國之金融設施，如限制提存，統制內外滙及出口貿易，與在七海實行之通貨緊縮策略，均所以維持外匯之穩定，而奠金融之基礎。及京滬失守，稅收大損，繼之復有華北準備銀行之成立，發行鈔票，套取外匯。當時中國外匯雖經統制以相抵制，然仍在竭力維持中，獨不念戰事非短時所能結束。按之國內經濟情形，已覺匯價遠出於自然水準之上，實無勉强維持之必要。倘其時毅然決然將匯價骤减至六七便士之間，或取得切實聯絡，嚴格統制外滙，二者能有一於是不第套取外滙發生困難，亦使資金逃避，可以預防，惜當局未能如霞飛將軍退守最後防綫之勇氣，實至堪惋惜者也。</p>
<p>今年中英平衡外匯基余成立，事實上確定法幣價格為八便士二五，其時上海金融情形，漸趨穩定，轉因通貨過剩，金融業放款甚濫，遂使投機囤積之風，於以大熾，外貨進口，於以劇增，上海人超之巨，為向來所未有，結果所屆，外滙之需要激增，基金之動支甚鉅，乃有今日外滙之一再緊縮，提存之再度限制，欲使在此情况之下，進口貨物勢將激减，貨物實銷，停滯不前，囤貨之風，或將中止，外匯需要，隨之大减，再加通貨緊縮，遠過於八一三之前夕，資金已至無可逃避之限度，國際收支，或能自然漸趨於平衡，則外匯宜無再縮之理</p>
<p>再就近月之外滙市塲供求而言，投機者購入遠期外滙，為數頗巨。以通貨緊縮法幣缺少之影響，屆時投機者勢將售出到期之遠期外滙，此為近日外滙略行回長之原因。故從上述之客觀事實而論，不問平衡基金將再維持外滙與吾，僅就國際牧支及供求關係，甚望法幣之外滙價值，最近不致再行下墜。惟癥結所在，求外匯不至虛耗，以策法幣之安定，亦惟有停止黑市滙兌之供給，一方面依照法定滙價，供給工商業正常之需要，如此，則政府所以昭大信於民，而人民對於法幣之信念愈深，資金逃避之風，不待諄勸而自絕也。</p>
<h3>糧食　奸商爲所欲爲　不惜危害民食　產鎖兩地米商彼漲此應　鮮粳暗盤竟至二十三元</h3>
<p>國米　市情依然紊亂、且覺淸寂、迺新到各貨因內地聞滬市暴漲後、糙價亦見飛漲、厚糙粳竟達十八元出零、與滬價相合、自須售二十二三允、彼漲此應、產銷米商雙簧合演、貨主遂不願脫售、均不出樣、同時囤戶及客販手中存貨、其前者出關之貨、當屬不鮮、而小價進者亦夥、然以限價關係、一般宿熱之貨早皆齊限、亦未出樣、而行家所有之貨、須應店銷、在此三日內俱巳售盡、竟至無貨應市、而一般店家因吃戶心慌備購、門市異常擁擠、（大衆不要墮入奸商彀中）而竟仰供無着、所以傳聞在市塲外有直接向貨主採辦、私作暗盤、鮮厚粳達二十三元半之說、各方熟視無覩、奸商遂行所無忌、市上昨有買賣、祇砶尖及受水漬之雜尖而己，為數僅三千七百餘包、而價開高砶尖十六元、中砶尖十五元七角、雜尖十五元半至十五元八角半、香港糯成交三百二十五包、價二十二元、至各路來源、河小無到、僅車輸運來南港早晚稻一千二三百包耳、</p>
<p>客秈　高貨巳經超越限價須二元以上、行囤以限價執行嚴厲、乃不敢出樣求售、故市塲中祇有砶糙與决秈應市、然內地帮納胃甚貪、且歡迎砶糙、故成交數仍有一千六七百包、行情以貨品論、又見別高三四角、</p>
<p>洋米　定貨合價愈昂、然二十六元之新西貢迄乏受主問津、故昨市正式售價僅照前日加半元、為二十五元半、開出一千三四百包、</p>
<h3>客銷蟬聯　粉市續穩</h3>
<p>粉市客銷續活、查南洋帮經週初開始活動後、廈門方面、已有二萬八千二百包運出、昨又添辦二三萬包、北洋各帮試銷後、進胃亦屬聯蟬、本街零批交易、亦照常有增無減、究緣目下物價昂騰聲中、需要者辦興自較往日濃厚也、統市成交各牌粉五萬包強、南洋帮去路、的佔半數、其餘均由本街內地及北洋各帮辦去、二號粉廠盤續站四元八角半現鈔、各廠因生產不多、對於業外囤戶、依然限制供給、</p>
<p>麥來源不絕、貨方以成本高昂、大都上棧待沽、惟連日各粉廠進胃呆滯、雖有囤戶問津、終非正式之實銷、故市面於無形中頗受打擊、咋日市塲做開蘇州高麥六元九角、丹陽麥六元七角半、安亭麥六元六角半、成交一千三百包、仍由本街囤戶購去、</p>
<h3>證券　內債平穩　外債無變</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、趨勢已見平穩、集會人數漸見稀少、一般大戶對於公債、大都已不感興趣、因其伸縮力遠不若外匯及黃金彈力之強、且一則係法幣交割、一則係匯劃進出、故投機份子有力大戶、羣捨此趨彼、英日會議消息兩岐、英外交部之答郭大使、口惠未絕、而實則未至、總之法幣問題、其是癥結所在、故公債行市難以起色、惟不致再有鉅大風潮、目下因利息關係、過問較繁、發息後情形當有鉅大變動也、昨日趨勢、初監後軟、亦有七八角之升沉、交易已見减少、鼎康。水康。松茂。大通均係賣出、聯益。聯和。大豐及二十二號、則均係賣出、檯面仍係零星散戶交易為多、市價結果略好二角至五角、比之隔日、暗中做價、則略疲數角、成交總數、的計四五十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤比前日統甲五二·六〇五一·〇〇五二·〇〇漲〇·四〇統乙四三·五〇四三·二〇四五·五〇又〇·二〇統丙圈四二·九〇四二·一〇四二·四五又〇·三統了四一·六〇……四一·六〇又〇·五〇統戊四二·〇四一·八〇四一·九五又〇·四〇</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大中華火柴公司股一百股、價為十一元八角、法幣、合匯劃十四元四角之譜、比前又漲起數角、　倫教英商各公司股票、本月二十五日（週二）掛牌行市、略見上升、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股、漲一鎊半、價為七十八鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股漲一便士半、價為十七先令、餘無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債、本月二十五日（週一）上下檔各公債、均平定無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗業轉向外匯　棉紗漲風稍戢　同時實銷沉寂　銀根鬆動無望</h3>
<p>紗市仍在般旋平定之境、但實銷異常沉寂、各方皆無發展希望、實緣金融收縮之故也、兼之各路運輸發生重重障礙、至於香港一路愛國心濃、對於中國粗細紗稍有採辦、然節節飛騰、亦嫌價格太貴、且裝運水脚雜費高昂、運達目的地成本之貴昂、殊堪驚人也、紗銷之缺乏、此為最大因素也、然上海一般殷富人士、將外匯升沉作比例、對於物價看漲心思仍在興高彩烈之際、二十支特金城廠開價為六百二十五元之鉅、但包額不夥、客帮亦抱隨需隨購矣、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、市塲安靜、因實需不旺，同業看好、囤藏之貨、始終不願放棄所以實銷雖停滯、市價回　無望、開價二十支雙馬外棧貨價為五百五十五元、棧單價為五百四十四元、中途平平、客銷仍不起、詎棧單市塲流動掮客呌喊聲陡震、查其原因、據某號前日代向申新九廠開進二十支雙馬一百五十包、價為四百八十元、全劃頭、業已廠方催促墊銀、如不履行契約的墊銀、即將圈賬、放此在市斬結、忽落七元、做到五百三十七元、外棧貨帶小四元為五百五十元、迨至收盤、市况亦平、查半日成交七百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌四元、棧單跌七元、粗紗亦跌三四元、惟牧羊漲一元半，永安廠開出二十支特金城五十包、價為六百二十五元、查棉紗昨日由天津運來六百五十件、又今日運往天津六百八十件、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、香港一六五同行五八〇內地一〇統計七五五</p>
<p>日紗市面、稍形回好、但實際交易、絕少生氣、惟下月份皮球交易異常興奮、足見人心看漲也、不過銀根鬆動無望、二十支月琴紗現出價為四十三元、下月份為四百三十三元之譜、</p>
<p>近日棉紗市塲之趨勢、稍形穩定、投機商之進出、不及昔日之熱鬧、查一般財富者、神經旣靈敏、手腕且高妙、據云投機方針已改變、一半將銀錢向外灘移解、去套購外匯、於是對於棉紗暫時放鬆一步、、兩個月後付款</p>
<h3>榮豐廠進　印棉一千件　兩個月後付款</h3>
<p>本棉交易靜寂、惟印棉同業互相買賣、依然不絕於途、售價甚昂、至於廠方受銀根鬆動無望之影響、對於購辦原料殊感困難、各種正謀圓滿方法、使原棉需用不斷、昨日榮豐廠購進之印棉一千餘件、均的期兩個月交解銀款、蘇北來源因滬上售價之高貴可觀、危險採辦者頗不乏人、且如果運達滬上、盈利之豐厚、莫可形容也、碼頭上到通花五百四十二包、茲將現棉情形列左、新特花八三·五〇同業中進一〇〇件鈔票棧交彭加浦二三·五〇又一〇〇件匯劃又康笛虛二八·〇〇榮豐廠進一〇〇〇件（又送廠二月解款）</p>
<p>另一報告云、滬埠外棉交易、自金融二度發生劇變後、交易已成死市、祇聞前訂之貨、向洋行方面結回、提取盈餘、藉鬆金融、新交易絕未聞有做出、而日來到貨甚擠、各廠商日來又努力設法、調度金融、以應此種困難也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、昨日頗形活躍、開盤先因孟買及利物浦來電挺秀而漲、同時引起新買戶之踴躍購進、及空頭抵補、後棉市因美棉出口津貼實現、國外購買者日衆、南方現貨價格均上騰、收盤時投機者及銀行界購買、結果較之上日漲二十磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比、</p>
<h3>疋頭　呢絨公會　集議營業方針</h3>
<p>本市匯價、自上月七日突告緊縮後、呢絨行號、多數宣告照樣板漲價一成半至二成、詎於本月初旬、外匯再度暴縮、呢絨業同業公會為統一今後價格起見、乃決定於昨日（七月廿六日）下午二時、在河南路會所召集同業會商一切、計到有聯興兆記，福順。順興。美發。昌記。義昌泰，王興昌等十二家、由王善福李全忠主席、經二小時之討論、關於今後之營業方針。放賬。及貨價樣板折扣等等、均有所決定、放賬方面、凡往常放節賬者、今改放號頭賬、（即每月淸賬）、放號頭賬者、今後概售十天期現款、（即可打劃頭票十天期）、上項辦法、當視客家信用可靠與吾而定、餘則均售現款、貨價方面、無論其貨之為新為舊、貨價概以五辨士為根據、俾新舊進價得以相扯、又如同一花色者、同業定價、務求統一、假使外匯突進四辦士之關時、屆時當再集會商決、至於樣板折扣、過去各行號聞、相差甚鉅、有二折。四折。三折八扣者、種種不一、今後亦將予以劃一云、（駿）</p>
<h3>糖市　國糖甬帮採辦　市盤又見新高價</h3>
<p>國籍　因原售滙劃以貼水關係、市價日趨高峯、茲悉甬帮有採購之訊、於是市態更見活躍、又見新高價、昨上白粉成交二百餘包、開四十元四角至四十元、特高者需四十一元、高黃崗靑數十包、竟開二十四元牛、綿赤三百餘包、二十九元、後呌三十元、惠舟白百餘包、卅七元</p>
<p>洋糖　據倫敦電、八月份七先令一辦土半、升半辦士、十二月份六先令二辦士二五、升二五、明年三月份六先令三辦士二五、升一辦士、</p>

<h3>杭州彈藥局</h3>
<p>現在杭州官憲創設製造廠一座，專造外國火藥彈子銅情砲彈等件，凡上海砲局之工匠，多有前往工作者。計廠中共用工匠一百名，監督製造者十員。每晨自九點鐘開工，至四點鐘歇工，禮拜日停止，一如上海製造局之式，惟其中無西人在內耳。查杭城向有軍裝局一所，火藥局一所，今乃專造西法彈藥，以收火攻之利，可見浙中大吏之加意於軍旅矣。</p>
<h3>出洋幼童近狀</h3>
<p>中國星使前經奉命往古巴查看華傭，聞會路過美國，到出洋幼童所肄業之處。據稱：「各幼童學習西文，優劣雖未能一致，而其中已有大進境者，不但其語言能聲入心通，即西文之不甚深奧者，亦可解釋矣。」又曰：「各幼童分寓於美國人家內，而美人無不交口稱贊，謂其有溫順　勤之品格，故皆愛之如己出。中國所遣去之華師，每照時收歸總局考究，籃以半月輪讀華文也。」又聞幼童於輪讀華文之後，發回至所分居各西人家，無不忻然而去，於是知美人相待之優，抑或總局內所授教者，其督責固為較嚴欵。</p>

<h3>鄕村於都市的居住問題</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>各有擾點各有缺點</p>
<p>說到鄉村與都市的居住問題，人們一定會發生一種疑問，便是一個人往在鄉村之中，他的壽命究竟比住在都市裏面是長還是短？這個答案是鄉村住民的壽命來得長，因為就統計所得，都市中的死亡率要比鄉村來得高。不但在中國，就是歐美各國，都市中的人口死亡率，也超過於鄉村。</p>
<p>住在鄉村裹面，的確有許多好處，特別顯明的是，空氣非常新鮮。農田一天到晚在野外工作，除了飽吸新鮮空氣之外，更可充分的晒到太陽光。為了每天在工作，身體銀鍊得相當好，比都市住民的體格來得強壯。為了人口稀，有了傳染病，沒有都市的傳染迅速。至於都市裏面，一般的住民，吸不到新鮮空氣，晒不到太陽光，勞動的時間又少，為了人口的擠居，有了傳染病就可很迅速的傳染開來，而價格方面，也比鄉村住民弱得多。</p>
<p>然而住在鄉村之中，也自有其缺點，而住在都市裹面，也未始沒有優點。鄉村住民在外面工作時，雖能飽吸新空氣，晒到太陽光，但工作回來，走進屋子，所有的房屋不但狹小，而且窗門很少，光線黑暗，地皮潮濕，和牛棚，豬欄，糞坑，等相隔甚近，蚊蠅成羣，使人駭異。這些都是致病之源。允其是飲水，沒有都市淸潔，食物的營養，以經濟不富裕，而不很充足。有了傳染病，不能送進設備很好的醫院。另一面，都市裏的房屋，建築比鄉村考究，基地乾燥，窗門洞開，蚊蠅比鄉村少得多，飲的水是經過沙濾的自來水，比鄉村乾凈，食物的營養也較鄉村爲足，害了疾病，就可很快的，送進醫院。尤其都市住居比鄉村住民的教育程度高，所以對於衛生問題，也比較要注意，所具的衛生常識，也來得豐富。這些便是住在都市裹比住在鄉村中來的優越的地方。</p>
<p>七八十年之前，歐美各國的都市中，死亡率比鄉村要超過一倍，但近年來已相差不遠了。都市死亡率的所以能够迅速的减少，惟一原因，就在衛生教育的進步。單就上海說，公私機關時常領導民衆，舉行衛生運動，利用種種方法，喚起住民注意衛生。種牛痘，打防疫針，普遍的宣傳，已獲得顯著的效果。兩年來上海人口擠居，能免大疫，就是注意衛生的結果。所以住在都市中的人們，對於衛生問題，不拘是個人衛生或公衆衛生，能個個注意，那麽壽命就不一定比住在鄉村裹的人會短促。</p>
<h3>夏季大衣</h3>
<p>— 圓</p>
<p>隨着高等呢絨西服店標榜的冬季大衣春季大衣，我要來提倡一種夏季大衣。</p>
<p>一定有許多人要批評我是熱昏了罷！大衣本是禦寒的東西，在冬季朔風凜冽的時候，在春季春寒料峭的時候需要一件大衣來保持體溫；但在這酷熱的季節，人們的衣裳儘量求薄求輕求凉爽，那裹還需要什麽累贅的大衣呢？</p>
<p>這話固然不錯，然而在那黃梅　雨的季節裹，在那夜闌熱退的時候，允其在這颶風肆虐的氣候裹，人們穿着薄薄的坦胸露臂的新裝，難道不需要一件外衣來調節體溫嗎？</p>
<p>有許多太太小姐們，已看到這點了，所以我們在路上常看見許多由綢的花布的長的短的大衣。</p>
<p>這些大衣，固然樣子很新穎好看，而且顏色也適合衣裳和時令，不過有幾個缺點，因為布的不滑爽而黏滯，呆板而嫌不透氣；而綢的又原料工價勗貴，一襲非十數金莫辦，在這百物漲價，人們經濟拮据的時候，普通人是負擔不起的。</p>
<p>現在我來提倡一種伯康物美的夏季大衣。</p>
<p>這種大衣的原料，是任何顏色的開司米絨綫一叉四分之一絞，（售價不到一元）再預備最細的竹籤，兩隻四隻的一樣一付，用單根絨錢照自己所喜歡的花樣編織起來，領口袖口可以配搭顏色繡上各種花朶；（不過一點要注意，就是領口袖口下擺須用雙綫編織，身腰袖子宜大而不宜小以免容易損壞）</p>
<p>這樣結成的大衣，薄如蟬翼，燦若雲霞，穿在身上，輕暖美麗，兼而有之，在那夕陽影裹微風蕩漾的時候，眞是飄飄欲仙，各位愛美的婦女，何不試一試呢？</p>
<h3>六月素</h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>在吾國社會習俗上，一般相信佛菩薩的善男信女們，每到農歷的六月裹，便不的而同的吃起「六月素」來。當六月初一的前夕，紛紛封素的大開暈腥，鶏，蝦，魚，肉，等雜列滿桌，吃個暢快！如此不顧殺戒，說是「封素」，眞乃荒唐極了。至於習俗相傳的爭吃「六月素」，却是未可厚非，因為在暑天酷熱之時，大家吃素，倒具有衛生，養生的意義。</p>
<p>記得無錫風俗，善男信女吃「六月素」很盛的；因為這裹的蔬菜等，得山水的秀氣，肥腴豐美，總比鄰產來得好，像鷄毛菜，毛荳子，長時綠，滬稱（長茫豆）黃荳芽綠荳芽，（雖然是黃豆與綠豆所孵，然得靑波綠水之靈，比上海肥碩得多），冬風，茄子，黃瓜等……都是富於維他命的東西，而無錫的豬血菌，（惠山之麓所產）油麵筋，小箱豆腐等素肴，更其是膾炙人口。所以筆者在幼年時代，常常跟着母親吃「六月素」，在暑天從未被腹痛，洩瀉的病魔所襲擊。惜今湖山變色，我想昔日的六月素肴，如今也充滿了血腥之氣。而筆者困守孤島，家鄉夢斷，對於這「六月素」，更不勝傷感哩。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>這幾天已交進了大伏，可算是正正式式的夏季了。於是吃六月素之風，一時大盛，不但太太奶奶們吃的很多，連一般男性，也正不少。這種吃素，可不能以迷信神權相責，其實在大熱天多吃些素菜，也是衛生之道，所以稱之為吃衛生素，亦無不可。何况又在米珠薪桂的時代，少吃肉類而多吃素菜，也很合於經濟原則呢。不過做主婦的，對於製作素菜這件事，倒也不大容易，因為天天只是吃些單純的菜蔬，日久厭生，恐怕要减少飯量，所以有時也得想些花樣纔好。如今我來介紹兩樣素菜，是筆者所愛吃的；一：紅燒素鋪蓋；將靑菜邊笋香菌豆腐乾等切成來子，用豆腐衣包成鋪蓋模樣，先放在熟油中汆黃，然後再和了香菌邊尖木耳金針菜等一同紅燒。二：甜醬炒茄子，先將茄子切成片段，入鍋燜熟，然後加了甜醬同炒，以酥為止，味很腴美。</p>

<h3>馮玉祥吃飯之幽默</h3>
<p>— 愛萍室主</p>
<p>軍事委員會副委員長馮玉祥氏，舉止頗多幽默；昔嘗於冰天雪地中，聚軍佐吃野餐，沒人冷饅頭數枚，　菜少許，馮食時，昨由顧盼，見人有難色，輒不悅。當馮在西北時，某日早餐，馮氏將黑麵所蒸窩窩頭，送於官佐及馮副館長（即馮治安將軍）飯廳內，使其進食，但所有給之窩窩頭，已隔多日，味微餿，故衆人皆皺眉，幾不能下咽。馮氏笑謂馮治安將軍云：「馮副官食量最大，今日能吃幾枚？」當時馮治安將軍因馮總司令在面前，更得盡量食之，乃笑曰：「能吃六枚！」馮氏叉依决詢問之，某處長曰五枚，某官佐曰四枚，一時笑語喧騰，未及片刻，黑麵窩窩頭，已分食凈盡矣。</p>
<p>又民國十七年時，馮軍駐鄭州，元旦之日，馮命士兵以口代鞭砲之乒乓聲，旣而召軍佐訓話，首謂：「今日過新年，諸位請坐下聽。」最後曰：「今天雖有大魚大肉吃，但我們預備了雞子，無論如何，每人得攤一塊，你們成天辛苦，今天得舒服舒服，我呌你們長官侍候你們，給你們盛養，你們可以不必動！」移時進餐，各部處長官胥忙忙碌碌，為屬員服役，如堂倌然，席間捧腹竊笑時，大有人在云。</p>

<h3>求則得之</h3>
<p>— 智</p>
<p>為什麽會有「求則得之」的事實呢？原來凡是一個人旣有所求，就一定有某種決心，接着就一定有某種行動，來達到他的目的。假使說，只有一種意念，願望，並無決心的行動，甚至還不及「守株待兔」的「守」與「待」，那末這就算不得「求」，自然也就不會「得」了。</p>
<p>懂得「求則得之」的人，眞可以說無往而不利：合理的求，固然可以如願以償，甚至悖理的求，例如偷竊，打刦，威脅，舉凡人世間一切罪惡的誅求，也往往可以如饗斯應。求，努力的求，用盡種種手段的求，實在是一切成功的秘訣！</p>
<p>小事如此，大事也如此。西歐有人一再婪索，果然一再滿載而歸；東亞有人一再刦持，果然也一再自詡「成功」，達到目的。此後，自然胃口越吃越大，所求越來越多，一定正還有許多似在意外而正在意中的好戲出現。</p>
<p>那來求的力量果然是一往無前的麽，果然沒有方法來對付這種求麼？當然，天下無絕對之事，並且天無絕人之路，這種求是有止竟的，也是有方法來對付的。不過地不會自己停止，必須有人強制牠停止，就是另用方法來對付。</p>
<p>這種對付的方法，也沒有什麼秘密，就是另一種的求。他向你求，你也向他求。他有決心，有行動，你也有決心，有行動。他可以成功，你也可以成功。彼此成功的希望，在純粹的理論上說，是五十與五十，彼此相等的。</p>
<p>然而兩者強拚下去，最後總有一方失敗，這又為什麼呢？不是求終於有所不得麼？我告訴你：這就為了求的正當不正當。一無所求遇到了不正當的求，一無所求只有失敗。但是不正當的求遇到了正當的求，不正當的求只有失敗。只有在這些時機，求才會有所不得。公理到底是會勝過強權的。</p>
<p>於此可見，我們必須以求來對付別人的求，允其必須以正當的求來對付不正當的求！</p>
<h3>前仆後繼</h3>

<h3>眞理的書（上）</h3>
<p>— 馬拉</p>
<p>夜晚非常柔和，但很陰暗。原野的風呼嘯着吹過遠處的森林田莊和山崗，帶來了泥土花草底芳香的氣息，在我們的頭上打旋，月光模糊得祇像一層白霧。四週錯雜的樹木亂投着陰影，像鬼怪似地塗上了黯淡的恐怖的色彩。小溪在靜寂中流得格外響了，如多嘴的老婦在訴說不盡的秘密。隱的地還能聽到一二聲野獸的呌號，凄慘而尖銳。</p>
<p>我和父親對面坐着，烟斗底火光一亮一暗地閃出了父親的憂鬱的况默的皺臉，像在思索着什末。這時樹林中起了一陣沙沙的聲響，宛如謹慎的脚步踏在枯黃的敗葉上。我突然害怕起來，我望望父親，他却沒有絲亳改變，似乎他一切的感覺全停止了，我不能再忍耐下去，我煩躁地喚了一聲「父親」。</p>
<p>我底話打斷了他的思索，他稍有點驚異，過後却警覺地說道：</p>
<p>「孩子，什麽事，怕吧，我來給你講一個故事好不好」？父親微笑地看我，他的話語中充滿了溫和和關心，我底恐懼一下子就飛走了。</p>
<p>「好好，講一個美麗的，父親」。我興高彩烈的說。</p>
<p>「美麗」？父親沈重地搖搖頭：「我底故事沒有一個是美麗的，但牠們全是眞實的」。他的眼光在我臉上掃來掃去，候着我的回答。</p>
<p>「也好，父親，那來快講吧」。我巳經等不及了。</p>
<p>「從前西方有一個國度，道僩國度和我們底沒有多大分別，也是有着大量的窮困的人民的，你不能想像他們過着怎樣的生活，你有衣服穿，有飽飯吃，度着幸福的日子，你不會知道他們的生活的」。父親這樣開始了他的故事。</p>
<p>「於是在那些窮困的人民中間流傳着一僩消息：說是二年前上帝把他自己寫成的一本書放在墨孫山上，這書裹向說的都是上帝告訴人類應該如何生活的眞理，書面上就刻着「眞理的書」的字，下面附註着：『讀它的人都要得到生命與幸福』，牠們在夜裏發着燦爛的光，整個國度的人都可以看到，這證明流傳的消息是不虛的，因此他們決定要去讀這冊眞理的盡了」。父親底語調洩露出大的苦惱，像在替他們擔心曾有一個巨大的災難降到他們的頸上。他深深地吸了一口烟，靑的烟氣升作繚繞的一縷，漸漸地消失在凝重的黑暗裹。</p>
<p>「但是這事被國王知道了，他的恐慌自然是很大的，因為這會妨害他的『天賦的』特權的，他立刻命令他的騎兵隊圍住了那個山頭，禁止人民去讀眞理的書，同時又成立了一所裁刺所，專用殘酷的刑罰鎮壓人民，經過了許多决的屠殺以後，他們居然變得很安靜了」。父親的臉上滿佈了陰雲，他長長地嘆息一聲，這嘆息許久地在空中盪漾，我的心也被嘆息聲漲滿了。</p>
<p>「難道就從此眞的安靜了嗎」？我疑惑地問道。</p>
<p>「不會的，孩子，願望是　不死的，憤怒更是無法抑制的東西，這正如一座雪下的火山，他們忍耐地等着，等着有一天用血來歸還血偵」。父親激動地回答，他的眼睛夢幻地眺望遙遠的在陰暗的天空勾劃着弧綫的鬱黑的山嶺，慢慢地用着平緩的聲調繼續下去：「這一天終於來到了，是到處發生飢荒的那年？幾十萬人民集合起來，勇敢地衝過了騎兵的鋒利而漂亮的長劍，句圍了王宮，他們雄偉的要求麵包的呼聲響亮地傳到國王的耳裹，使國王發抖，沒有一點辦法，在人民認識了他們的力量以後，國王是沒有一點辦法的，所以最後那個專制的怪物就被毀掉了」。父親似乎被喜悅壓倒了，好像他們底命運也就是他底命運，臉上罩着愉快的歡笑，我不覺高興地喚了他一聲。</p>
<p>「好孩子，讓我講下去吧，悲慘的在後面哩」。父親的臉一下子叉變成陰曙了。</p>
<p>我更關心地聽下去：</p>
<h3>從翻譯到改寫</h3>
<p>— 楊晉豪</p>
<p>外國人所著從理論上討論中國問題的書，我也讀；但對於外國人所著描寫中國故事的書，我却一向不喜歡看；雖然據說其中也有寫得很好的，但我總以為：外國人對於中國的人情世故，社會狀態的認識不會怎樣深刻，他們憑一點道聽塗說或表面觀察而寫作，難免有點隔靴搔癢。另外，我又認為：中國的故事田中國人寫，總比外國人寫來得好。自然，這是近乎偏見，不足為訓的。</p>
<p>賽珍珠的「愛國者」的譯本，承朱霎兄送下一冊；我看了一個頭就不看下去了，覺得它情節離奇，而技術叉很平凡。後來讀到本刊上的批評，知道了其中的慨要。不久朱雯兄來訪，我們便談到這件事，除掉了談到賽珍珠對於中國事情認識不够—允其是她根據某些新聞政策的宜傳文字來作推想誇大，以致多處不符現實，在容觀上等於侮辱中國……等外，我還表示這樣的意見：</p>
<p>「你拿翻譯它的功夫來自已創作，我想，結果總比譯本來得好。認識果然耍正確得多，材料也要充實些，而技術却不見得比她差。</p>
<p>「即使要翻譯它，也不該直譯。你不妨拿它做底本，來改寫一下：把其中比較精彩的地方，加以補充，鋪張；把其中視點錯誤的地方為之刪削改正；同時在措辭結構上，也可以改寫得更合於中國式一點。至於出版時，在書前把這些情形申明一下得了。」</p>
<p>「不錯。日本人就乖得多，這書的日譯本，把不利於日本的地方都刪節了。」朱雯兄似乎為自己譯述時的過於「忠實」，有點後悔。</p>
<p>其實，我前面所述的一點意見，可以說是我對於整個翻譯問題的見解，不單是對「愛國者」一書而論的。我始終認為：翻譯（著作也一樣）這件工作，是為讀者服務，而不是為原著者服務。把那意識歪曲，觀點荒謬的東西原封不動地翻譯過來，這樣地對於原著者的「忠實」，果然要不得；就是那意識正確，觀點合適的作品，照着原文「直譯」，弄得信屈警牙，使人像讀「天書」一般地感到「頭痛」，這樣地對於原著者的「忠實」，我也不以為是最好的辦法。</p>
<p>把外國文法的原文譯成中國文法的中文，使人讀來「順」口，這個起碼倏件是不用說。好在九一八前經過一决「翻譯論戰」之後，「硬譯的東西已經少了許多；不過我還似乎不能滿足。我認為那些把握時代的第一流的世界名著，除掉須有「信達雅」的全譯本外，還有出版確能傳神的改寫本的必要。試問那些文化水準較低的大衆，能啊幾人讀得懂那些全譯本的名著？先是那一連串長的人名地名，在他們讀來巳覺眼花撩亂；再像那些過於細膩的描寫，也使他們的印象鬆懈，不能領會；更有許多與中國的風俗習慣不符合的情節語氣，使他們不易貼切瞭解。像這許多地方，我以為都可以改寫得合於中國式一點，而且簡短些，通俗些。那長篇大著，還得壓縮一下，來幾個「潔本」。</p>
<p>在九一八時，會有人拿「資木論不一定要給大衆看得懂（這是大意，原文載文藝新聞）的話來反對我主張「順」譯的意見，不知道他是用什麼身份說話的。果然，我不勸大家一定要讀懂了資本論後再去革命，不過，倘能讓大衆也懂得一點資本論的意思，那總是好的吧？在歐美有「學生資本論」「工人資本論」等書出版，中國也有「通俗資本論」等的譯著，這無非是一件大衆化的工作，為謀提高大衆的文化程度。</p>
<p>在文學上，也需耍這樣的大衆化的工作。在蘇聯，有幾本名著，另外出了專供兒童閱讀的壓縮的通俗本；在中國，確能把握時代性的名著不多，那末，借用國外的名著來改作，出一套專供大衆閱讀的壓縮的通俗本，實在是很有意義而且切需的。</p>
<p>不過，改寫世界名著，也不是可以隨便的。須經一翻選擇功夫之外，還得把每部名著的情節，色彩，意識，神情，全部抓住，而且化解在中國式的鎔　裹，像鍊鋼般的抽出其精彩而轉述出來才好。所以，這是一件很費精力，神思的苦工，實有需要文藝界的集體的討論，合作，更有需要文化機關的贊助。</p>
<p>我希望這件改寫（或改譯）世界名著的事，在不久的將來，能有計劃地實行。</p>

<h3>喜樂（六）</h3>
<p>信心的喜樂；極其單純，極其聖滌，單純：是喜樂得原因，純一定不雜。有人說：我信基督，我的家庭和順，夫唱婦隨，所以喜樂；有人說：我信基督，我的生意興隆，財發萬金，所以喜樂：有人說：我信基督，我的官運亨通，不次　遷，所以喜樂。……這些喜樂的原因，都不純一，不一定是從信心而來，雖有喜樂，恐不可靠。聖滌：是喜樂的性情，聖神而淸　，不是喜樂世俗的事物，也來夾世俗的事物；像上面所說種種，眞基督徒不但不以爲喜樂，且以爲糞土，爲污　。漂泊無家的浪子，一旦歸到父親膝下；飢餓號泣的嬰孩，一旦歸到慈母的懷抱，那一種喜樂，與基督徒的喜樂，庶乎近之。</p>
<p>基督徒的喜樂，是出於唯一的眞神，所喜樂的，也只有唯一眞神，眞神不變，所以喜樂不變。平安有喜樂，艱難困苦也有喜樂；尊　有喜樂。貧賤屈辱，逼迫笑駡，鞭打囚禁也有喜樂，並不是喜樂的不近人情，乃是超乎人情，所謂人情，乃是庸夫俗子，牧隸樵夫，共有之情。以人人共有之情爲情，是爲人淸；基督徒是超乎萬人之情之上，而獨有神情。神情：是世人所沒有的，神情的喜樂，也是世人所沒有的，而且是不能領會的。要得此高尚喜樂，惟有信基督。　上海基督教文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>我與「花濺淚」</h3>
<p>— 藍蘭</p>
<p>記得還是遠在半年卡爾登公演「花濺淚」之後，中華婦女互助會特地召集了一次座談會。除了花濺淚的演員與新聞界人員之外，到會的要以舞蜀姊妹佔多數了。當時舞界姊妹們對這第一次以舞女為題材，為舞女宣洩了一口氣的劇本的演出，感覺得異常的興奮。也就情不自禁的述說了許多她們自身悲慘的處境。為了要外界明瞭她們的環境，為了要外界知道她們並不是醉生夢死的專家，為他她們是與其他的女性一樣的有着清楚的頭腦，清潔的靈魂。在互助會贊助之下，舞界自身要演出一次「花濺淚」。她們的生活艱難和苦痛，深深的感動了我。就在這熾熱的氣氛的包圍中，經過會場的要求與鼓勵，我就大着胆子，不顧一切的承當了這次導演的職責。但最近這二十七號的公演—參加戲劇節一樣的大公演—而又負着「慈善」的使命的時候，又使我惶悚於負荷之艱重了</p>
<p>在排演的過程中，使我們感到極大的困難是演員們的有限的時間，「什麼是最適當排練時間呢？」當然誰也不忍剝她們上午惟一的睡眠。餐舞，茶舞，晚舞之外，所剩餘的只有午後兩點至四點短短的兩個鍾頭了。但她們還須交際和應酬。所以這僅有的兩小時也成了問題。這樣當然影響到排練的工作，甚至有一個很長的時期我們簡直沒有辦法繼續我們的排練。但最近幾個星期為了那些流離失所，孤苦無依的難胞，她們犧牲了睡眠，克服了困難，積極的排練，這種熱心的精神，實在令人感動！</p>
<p>五時一刻，這特殊的上演時間，是特與大會商請的。雖然茶舞的犧牲不可免，但可以不影響到晚舞。「花濺淚」的全劇演出須要四小時之久，為了觀眾的便利，最後決定了援劇藝社星期公演的例，只上演兩幕，這種不得已的苦衷，還請諸位觀眾加以大量的原諒。</p>
<p>關於演出的成績，是不敢預計。我自己有限的學識，而加之最近忙於「女人公寓」「夜上海」的拍攝排練的兩重工作，真是心有餘而力不足。因演員們的努力，與熱心援助和戲劇同志們支持的熱忱，雖說這次的上演是為了更大的目的，但我還是極希望有些少的成就的。</p>
<p>這里我還要說的是：謝謝劇作者於伶先生允許我導演本戲，使觀眾能夠透過這次演出而了解這一羣瘦弱而被壓榨得透不過氣來的舞界姊妹的生活，因此給與她們許多鼓勵與援助，使她們不致用消極的自殺來結束她們這不幸的身心，而要積極的堅強起來，堅韌的，努力的，向着解放她們生活的光明的前途邁進。也就是互助劇團參與此時此地的中國話劇史上的空前「盛事」所迫切期待豐盛果實的苦心。</p>

<h3>陳燕燕小姐含淚悲談：電影是我的生命（下）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>－－終天抱恨的從影史－－</p>
<p>…處女作是南國之春</p>
<p>來滬一年後，初上銀幕，主演「南國之春」，導演人蔡楚生先生，亦是第一次獨當一面的作品。自己因為向沒演劇經騐，上場後真是啼笑皆非，一些不懂，多虧蔡先生循循善誘，在他悉心指導下幸喜渡過了這第一重的難關。後來「南國之春」攝成出映，一般與諭與賣座情形，居然都很不錯；我亦總算因人成事，在銀壇上就此立定了腳跟。所以對於蔡先生這一番殷勤將扶的厚意，也是我所常為感念不置的。</p>
<p>…拍戲辛勞深染胃病</p>
<p>「電影飯不是人吃的」這句話確說得不錯。拍戲區作實較致力其他事業為苦，累是真的累極了。因此，當一個電影演員既須深具耐苦精神，還得生就壯健的身體，柔弱一點的人便將無力勝任。像我就為趕工拍戲，不時飽一頓餓一頓地飲食失常，早已致下了很深重的胃病。不過我對電影工作的意念是絕對好勞惡逸的。不論工作怎樣艱苦，只望多演戲多拍片子；片子越拍得多，我就愈感興奮；反之，要是好多時候沒有戲給我拍演，那真比較任何不如意事都覺難受。因為，自己認定電影就是我的生命。演戲即極辛勞決不會感到煩苦；如果真的不呌我拍戲，我就簡直沒法子可望繼續生存。</p>
<p>…每演悲劇必流真淚</p>
<p>以前演過幾十部片子，十九都是悲劇，一般的意見，大都說我以表演悲劇較為適宜；我卻毫沒定見，且很希望能演多方面的角色，最好每種個性不同的人物，有機會都給我試上一試。關於悲劇的表演，我有一個偏見，那便是絕對不願意用着假的眼淚。有一種藥水，把它點在眼眶下面，雖也很見像真；但拍長鏡頭時，畢竟看得出它是凝滯而不會簌簌下注的。每一次遇到這類表演，只須動了真情感，我便自會流下多熱淚。可是，在攝影場上有時看到別人作此真流淚的表演，自己禁不住就要失笑起來。</p>
<p>終天抱恨是我從影史上無限的隱痛，也正是使我努力積極向上的一種無形的策勵。現在我雖有了些微的成就，而父親則已去世年久，墓木早拱了！咳！我除寄托整個生命於電影事業，力求奮進之外，我又更有什麼法子好來贖這一番莫大的罪愆呢？（完）</p>

<p>上海業餘話劇界的慈善公演週中，二十七日是藍蘭導演的「花濺淚」，參與此次演出的是「互助劇團」的舞女會員，如楊文英，韋楚雲，莉莉張（即袁牧之導演「都市風光」中的張新珠），及莉莉方等。而這位飾演米米的楊文英，現在正轟傳着和國華演員白雲鬧戀愛，因之，在某一天她們排戲的時候，筆者和她們談起了這問題。</p>
<p>那天排的是米米自殺的一幕，楊文英正拿着香烟罐當作喝來沙而的樣子的時候，我剛和韋楚雲談起白雲的事，楊文英聽了，忙把香烟罐砰的投在桌上，生氣地說：「自說自話」</p>
<p>韋楚雲和楊文英是老朋友，有一個時候她們會同住在靜安寺路一家木器店的樓上，而且出入相偕，可以說是刎頸之交，所以對於楊白戀愛事件的記載，韋楚雲都非常注意。但是，或許韋楚雲的感情比較冷靜一點，見了楊文英生氣的樣子，就說：</p>
<p>「好好兒排你的戲吧」。一面對我說：「舞女們的被人家說東話西，已是司空見慣了。楊文英和白雲什麼，當然也有一點緣由的，就是上個月我們舞業婦女聯誼會成立的時候，會在卡爾登公演一次戲，白雲就由一位朋友的介紹，參加我們的演出。當時因為舞聯會沒有找到會址，排戲就暫時借楊文英的新居，或許就因為排戲和演戲關係，就謠傳着戀愛什麼了。」</p>
<p>「所以，我感覺到：韋楚雲真像丁香那樣激昂起來，一我們的舞聯應該努力求發展，使一般姊妹們都能夠知道自己的地位，和人格，做舞女是並不下賤的，祗要自己的生活嚴肅起來，外界的人自然也會變換一種目光來看我們的！」</p>
<p>同時，也有朋友遇見白雲，他也竭力否認，他說：我要好好　演幾部戲。</p>
<p>舞女，影人，都是生活活的人，我們沒有理由反對他們的戀愛的，但也正因為是舞女和影人，就特別引人注意，要外界人士的轉換目光，是得以努力來作代價的；戀愛什麼都是細小的問題。</p>

<h3>大大王，二大王　荒郊爭雄記（三）</h3>
<p>— 李斐叔</p>
<p>－梅邊雜憶之五－</p>
<p>這一天，後台的同人，既往昔，有點詫異起來！偷偷的派了一位武行，尾隨其後以偵之。看他倆走到了黑龍潭，這位武行，也暗伏於荒烟蔓葦間的一個「土阜」之上，由高處屏息以窺，不看也還罷了！一看之下，把這痊特派的專使，嚇得幾乎「舌頭伸出來縮不進去」！趕快「馬上加鞭」，回到後台，把這段情由，報告了同人，大家一聽之下，個個毛骨悚然！深恐鬧出性命危險來，於是全班人馬，一齊飛奔「黑龍潭」而來！</p>
<p>還沒有走到戰場，遠遠的但望見「　烟滾滾，走石飛沙，拳來腳去，兎起龍落」，這兩位好漢，正在打得十分起勁不分勝負的當口，突然看見來了這許多人，知道大事已被洩漏，可惜「為山九　，功虧一簧」了！也不先向眾人招呼，祗是相對歎息，擺手無言！此時的神情，大有「岳武穆半路上接到十二金牌，恨不能「直搗黃龍，與諸君痛欲」的氣概！大家走近前去，先事安慰了一番。再看他倆的身上，都打得青一塊紫一塊，好像兩張有色的地圖，大家道才回悟到在後台扮戲之時，他倆不肯更換內衣的真因。大家又問他兩人道：「你們兩人有什麼大仇恨，要在此地決鬥呢」？這兩位英雄，所回答的話，實在是奧妙非凡！他倆說：「連我們自己，也不曉得為着什麼？不過在未打之先，彼此見面的時候，心上總是有點芥蒂。自從動手之後，彼此心上，倒反覺得痛快得多了！你問我們為什麼要如此，我們自己實在不知道為什麼要如此？大家聽他倆的話，真是又好氣，又好笑！祗得略加儆戒，申斥了幾句。替他們拾起了地上的衣服，又替他們穿着整齊，一同走進城來，把他倆送回家去。</p>
<p>第二天，經後台的同人公議，設宴講和。兩人並即席當眾宣　，「往後再也不如此蠻幹了！」這一　「龍虎門」武戲，才算閉幕。</p>
<p>後來據他們兩人自己承認，爭離了一月，雖然伯仲之間未分勝負，但是比較起來，許君德議略佔上風。所以後台的同人，稱許德義是大大（音代）王，朱湘泉是二代王，直到現在，這個對號還依然存在。</p>
<p>路易斯海佛在“The　Man　in　the　Iron　Mask“中，戴着一個鐵面具，神情夠恐怖。據說，在他拍攝的過程中，要是口渴，那祗好用一根極細的橡皮管子來吸着瓶裏的水。其實，在這裏，他呼吸也是很困難的呢。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Southern Shanxi Retreat Toward Jincheng; Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Recover Chongyang, a Major Fire Breaks Out Within the City; Fierce Fighting Erupts on the East Bank of the Dongjing River, Japanese Troops are Surrounded; Chinese Troops Recover Ma'anshan Northeast of Xinkaitang Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) Japanese troops stubbornly resisting near the Ninety-Three Heights have suffered heavy blows from Chinese troops in recent days, sustaining significant casualties and fleeing toward Yangjiazhuang, Lizhuanggou (both west of Yangcheng), and other places. Chinese troops, seizing the momentum, are pursuing them like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The remaining Japanese forces are scattering at the sight of the Chinese. On the morning of the 25th, Chinese troops approached the outskirts of Yangcheng and, taking advantage of the Japanese troops' unsettled position, selected many daredevils to lead the attack on the city. After a prolonged hand-to-hand combat, both sides suffered heavy casualties. Subsequently, the Japanese troops, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated in two directions: one group fleeing northwest to Qinyang, and the other scattering toward Jincheng. The Chinese army is continuing to pursue the Japanese troops. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Guilin On the night of the 24th, a unit of the Chinese army stormed into Chongyang city from the northwest, setting fire to all of the Japanese army's ammunition depots, granaries, and the railway station. They engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. By the morning of the 25th, the Chinese army had killed many Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, having completed their mission, they safely retreated to 口口口 to await further orders. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) This morning, the sound of machine-gun fire could be heard from afar, indicating that Japanese troops were again attacking villages and towns in the Zhongshan County area, and that Japanese troops were advancing towards the Pearl River Delta. (Dispatch of the 26th from Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman commented on the situation in Shanxi province, saying that the Japanese troops in southwestern Shanxi were currently encountering many difficulties because the area was experiencing heavy rains, impeding their transportation. The Chinese army, aware that the Japanese troops attacking Taihang possessed superior equipment, concentrated its forces to attack the flanks and rear of the Japanese troops. As a result, the two armies are currently locked in a stalemate in the Yangcheng and Jincheng area. (Dispatch of the 16th from Reuters)</p>
<p>Fancheng On the night of the 20th, a certain unit of the Chinese army, together with Wang, the magistrate of Huaixian, launched a surprise attack on Huaixian. The puppet troops under Zhang seized the opportunity to defect en masse. More than half of the two hundred or so Japanese troops stationed in the city were annihilated by the Chinese army. The remaining troops broke through the south gate and fled in disarray. The county seat was recovered by the Chinese army, and a large amount of baggage, weapons, and ammunition were captured. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, when the Chinese army in Shandong attacked Gaomi, the Japanese army's arsenal in the city suddenly caught fire. Taking advantage of the Japanese army's confusion, the Chinese army set fire to various depots, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the Japanese. In this battle, the Japanese army lost 300 tons of gasoline, a large amount of ammunition, and a large quantity of military supplies. Furthermore, the Chinese army recently attacked Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway and burned down the Japanese army barracks in Xinyang city. (Dispatch of the 26th from Associated Press)</p>
<p>Xingji Since the Japanese army's multi-pronged attack in southeastern Shanxi earlier this month failed again, the war has now become quiet. Although the Japanese have successively captured a few places such as Qinshui, Qinyuan, and Wuxiang, they are suffering from the Chinese people's scorched-earth policy, the constant attacks by Chinese soldiers, and the continuous rain, which makes it impossible to use machinery. Not only have the Japanese been unable to achieve their expected "mopping-up" operation, but now, although the fighting seems to have come to an end on the surface, hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops are operating in southeastern Shanxi, sometimes regrouping, sometimes dispersing, to intercept, flank, surround, and lure the Japanese army, with the aim of annihilating the Japanese in the triangular area. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Shashi At noon on the 25th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops on the east bank of the Dongjing River in an encirclement maneuver. After six hours of fierce fighting, dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed. At 5:00 PM, the Japanese side sent more than two hundred infantry and cavalry troops, along with one artillery piece, from Qianjiang, dividing into two groups to attack the Chinese unit. A fierce battle broke out between the two sides at Meijiazui. The Chinese unit employed unusual tactics, attacking the rear of the Japanese with one part of their forces, and concentrating artillery fire to strike the flanks and rear of the Japanese troops. Until late at night, the Japanese, having suffered heavy casualties, fled back into the city. In this battle, more than fifty Japanese soldiers were killed and more than eighty were wounded, including the commander, Norio Fukuda. A large number of documents and spoils of war were captured. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Miluo On the 26th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Ma'anshan northeast of Xinkaitang. From morning until noon, after a half-day of fierce fighting, the Chinese army broke into the Japanese army's position. Subsequently, three hundred Japanese troops from Yueyang heard the alarm and came to reinforce, but they were also successively repelled by the Chinese army. Ma'anshan was recovered by the Chinese army. In these two battles, the Chinese army killed over a hundred Japanese soldiers. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Guilin On the evening of the 25th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops at Ma'anshan, Xinkaitang. Subsequently, the Japanese army sent reinforcements, and after fierce fighting until Haishi (9-11 PM), the Japanese army was repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses in this battle. The Chinese army also had one battalion commander wounded and more than ten company commanders and lower ranks killed in action. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) The Tong (County)-Gu (Beikou) Road, which was forcibly built by the Japanese army in Hebei Province, has not yet been opened to traffic due to repeated sabotage by the Chinese side. On the 19th, a train carrying supplies for the Japanese army, traveling from Fengtai to Tong County, detonated a landmine planted by the Chinese side on a bridge about four kilometers from Fengnan. The Japanese train overturned, resulting in many deaths and injuries. All of the military supplies sank into the river. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reports indirectly received here from Luoyang, the Japanese army is again active in southern Henan. The fighting in this area has been suspended for a long time, but since the 24th, the Japanese army, under the cover of armored trains, has been moving north along the Pinghan Railway from Xinyang. (Dispatch of the 26th from the Second Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Pingjiang The important Hubei stronghold of Chongyang city was captured on the evening of the 25th. Previously, a certain unit of the Chinese army adopted a tactic of converging attacks from multiple directions. On the morning of the 25th, they successively arrived at their designated locations and, after occupying all the high ground around Chongyang, launched a coordinated encirclement and attack on the Japanese troops in the city. The Japanese troops at the south gate were unable to withstand the pressure and were broken through by the Chinese army. They then set fire to the warehouses storing ammunition, weapons, and provisions accumulated by the Japanese army in the city, while simultaneously mopping up the remaining troops in the city. By about 7:00 PM, Chongyang city was completely recovered by the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese troops broke through the west gate and fled north. In this battle, over two hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<h3>Kunming: Evacuation of the Population</h3>
<p>(Kunming) The provincial government authorities have ordered all women, children, and non-essential personnel in the city to evacuate Kunming. Failure to comply will result in mandatory enforcement. The order stipulates that those who remain in the city must obtain a residency permit from the provincial government. According to recent figures, the population of Kunming has increased from 150,000 before the war to over 200,000 at present. (Dispatch of the 26th from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Raid Wuzhou</h3>
<p>Guilin One Japanese aircraft flew over Wuzhou at 9:00 AM on the 26th, conducting reconnaissance for a long time before leaving. At about 1:00 PM in the afternoon, eighteen Japanese aircraft flew from Yun'er and invaded the airspace over Wuzhou City, dropping dozens of explosive and incendiary bombs in the urban area. Major fires broke out in several places in the city. The extent of the damage is currently under investigation. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<h3>One Japanese Aircraft Shot Down in Raid on Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Twenty-seven Japanese bombers, divided into three squadrons of nine aircraft each, flew via Yichang toward the upper reaches of the Yangtze River last night. It is reported that one squadron bombed Wushan in the Yangtze River Gorge, while the other eighteen continued to fly west, not attacking Chongqing but reaching Badong before turning back. According to official reports, one Japanese bomber was shot down in the air battle during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing on Sunday night. However, this claim has not been confirmed by other sources. The official report also stated that two squadrons of Japanese aircraft, one of eighteen and one of nine, attacked Chongqing on Sunday night. When they reached the skies over Chongqing, Chinese fighter planes intercepted them. As a result of the air raid, only dozens of houses on the north bank of the Jialing River were damaged and caught fire, and some civilians were injured or killed.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Currency War</h3>
<p>Since Hong Kong has restricted the supply of foreign exchange on the Shanghai black market, and North China has been trying to flood Shanghai with legal tender, the financial market in Shanghai has undergone tremendous changes due to this north-south exchange. In recent days, the changes have entered a static phase. According to the exchange rate posted by HSBC, one yuan of national currency is worth four pence in British currency, and one hundred yuan of national currency is worth $7.75 in US currency, gradually forming a new standard. At the same time, the responsible authorities of the National Government have also firmly declared that they will do their utmost to maintain the legal tender policy. The market situation should tend to be calm during wartime.</p>
<p>This large influx of legal tender from North China into Shanghai, on the surface, is due to a small number of speculative merchants taking advantage of the difference in exchange rates between Tianjin and Shanghai in an attempt to obtain huge illegal profits; but in fact, this is another act in the Sino-Japanese currency war. Because in the severely controlled North China, who can possess a surplus of legal tender in large quantities? Who can transport and export it in large quantities? This is clearly a planned and backed action; its purpose is to absorb legal tender through clever tricks and plunder, in order to obtain foreign exchange, and at the same time reduce the amount of legal tender in circulation, and promote its own chips.</p>
<p>As for the future, it can be foreseen that before the Sino-Japanese currency war ends in the occupied areas, Shanghai and other places that have obtained control of the currency will inevitably continue to find ways to undermine the credit of legal tender, while seizing the foreign exchange fund of legal tender; and China, which implements the legal tender policy, will also do its best to maintain the integrity and soundness of the legal tender system. Then the Sino-Japanese currency war in the future may become more and more intense as time goes on. The Chinese people residing in Shanghai and other occupied areas must have a thorough understanding of the truth of the currency war, in order to reduce personal economic losses and not harm the strength of the national war of resistance.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the amount of legal tender issued by China at the beginning of this month was 200 billion yuan; part of it is circulating in the mainland controlled by the Chinese government, and part of it is distributed in the occupied areas. The price of legal tender circulating in the Chinese mainland has not changed at all; the legitimate foreign exchange needed by the people can be supplied by the government at the statutory price. As for the legal tender distributed in the occupied areas, it is the target of the current currency war. Japan can directly put pressure on this part of legal tender with political, economic and military forces; while the Chinese government can only maintain it indirectly; allowing the black market of foreign exchange, which China cannot quickly ban for various reasons, is the biggest weakness that attracts the opponent's attack. Although legal tender in the occupied areas is in this environment, it is still trusted by the people everywhere; not only is it regarded as the only credit tool by the people in the vast occupied areas, but even in the cities where the Japanese army directly forces the prohibition of legal tender, it cannot stop its secret circulation. It can be seen that legal tender has a solid foundation that is not easily destroyed!</p>
<p>After a considerable period of currency war, it has proven the "long history" of legal tender, so the Japanese side is angry at the help of third countries. In fact, the circulation of a currency must have a legitimate political force to promote it, and sufficient issuance reserves as a basis, in order to gain the trust of the people and become a universal currency, which is by no means something that a simple gun can do. Borrowing the power of guns, its function is only like the range of bullets, and after the range, everything is invalid! In addition to military tickets, it is necessary to use other names and print other chips, which shows the truth of the range of bullets. But there is no room for nominal and flowery paper without issuance reserves, so their northern chips and counterfeit banknotes once claimed to be prepared with Japanese yen, but most of the gold and silver prepared by Japanese yen has been transported to the United States and exchanged for steel; even the textile industry, which Japan regards as the economic lifeline, has difficulty obtaining foreign exchange for the raw materials it needs, such as wool and cotton, so how can it supply the foreign exchange for counterfeit banknotes. Therefore, their Hongkou chips claimed to be prepared with Chinese legal tender, which is a poisonous plan to seize the foreign exchange fund of legal tender; unexpectedly, the Chinese strategy of making the black market of foreign exchange plummet not only made their chips have no place to rely on and exposed their weaknesses, but also caused a fatal blow to their monopolized commerce in the occupied areas!</p>
<p>The currency war is in full swing and will inevitably become more and more fierce. In the future currency war, in order to pursue the final victory, China must have the Chinese government and the people more earnestly fulfill their respective obligations than before. The Chinese government must quickly strengthen the control of trade, reduce imports, so as to avoid excessive consumption of foreign exchange funds; and must continue to obtain financial assistance from friendly countries. The amount of assistance is not the problem, but its main significance is to prove that legal tender has the qualifications to obtain assistance internationally; to prove that in the currency war, legal tender has exclusive assistance, that is, exclusive credit. In addition, it is necessary to use agile and effective methods to make legal tender flow to the mainland in large quantities. On the part of the people, they must firmly believe in legal tender, recognize that legal tender has a unique credit; and understand that if they want to avoid economic losses in the currency war, the safest way is to move funds to the mainland and engage in the development of various resources.</p>
<p>British Compromise with Japan</p>
<h3>External Announcement Expressing Disappointment to Britain; Britain's Acknowledgement of Japan's Demands is Truly Regrettable; Chongqing United Daily News Lambasts Britain's Attitude</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today, expressing the Chinese government's disappointment with the British government's attitude in the Tokyo Conference. The statement said that when the Chinese authorities learned of the content of the Anglo-Japanese proposal, they could not conceal their disappointment with the attitude taken by the British government. The Japanese army's aggression in China was declared unanimously by Britain itself and other member states of the League of Nations. Now the British government feels it appropriate to acknowledge the so-called special requirements of the Japanese army in China, which is truly regrettable. What is even more surprising is that the British government has undertaken to notify British officials and people in China not to take any actions or plans that hinder the Japanese army from achieving its goals. However, Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons that the British government's policy cannot be changed by the command of other countries, and the guarantee that the development in Tokyo does not contain any changes in the British policy in China that has been consistently implemented in the past, is still satisfactory to the Chinese government. The British government's guarantees under the League of Nations resolutions that it would not take any actions that would weaken China's resistance and increase the difficulties of China's war, and that it would do its utmost to assist China, are still in our ears. It is hardly necessary to urge the British government not to forget this guarantee. The Chinese government deeply believes that although the announcement of the Anglo-Japanese proposal has aroused doubts, the British government will take an attitude that conforms to its legal and moral obligations to China to deal with the so-called Tianjin local incident and express its firm policy towards the situation created by the Japanese in China through action. (Dispatch of the 22nd from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The United Daily News here this morning published an editorial strongly criticizing the attitude held by the British in the Tokyo Conference. The newspaper published the full text of the Anglo-Japanese compromise, as well as the speeches made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax on this matter, and analyzed them, saying, "We dare not hastily define broad terms such as 'the special needs of the Japanese army in China.' The British know very well the goals that the Japanese army hopes to achieve in China. If the British provide assistance and convenience to aggression or violence, then the British government at least no longer has moral principles or concepts of justice. For example, if a strongman robs our house and kills our people, and suddenly a neighbor comes out and says to the robber, 'I have noticed your special needs and will undertake to prevent the family members of the robbed from interfering with your actions,' what would we think of this neighbor? The Chinese reaction to Chamberlain's remarks is also the same. Suppose this neighbor has no legal obligation to help us, but encourages the strongman, but at the same time declares that he has not changed his policy of treating neighbors kindly, what will our reaction be? Moreover, as long as the League of Nations has not been dissolved, the resolutions passed by it cannot be regarded as waste paper. We hope that when we occasionally recall the repeated resolutions passed by the League of Nations with British participation and support, we are not dreaming in vain. To provide effective assistance to China is in conflict with not taking actions that hinder the goals of the Japanese army in China. This attitude of Britain not only reduces China's resistance and increases its difficulties, but also creates international disputes and difficulties. We hope that Chamberlain's declaration that it does not contain any intention of changing the British policy towards China is a sincere remark. We do not doubt its sincerity, but its sincerity must be proved by its attitude and its actual actions at the formal meeting in Tokyo." The newspaper concluded by supporting President Chiang's speech calling on the people of the whole country to work hard on their own and not rely on others. Furthermore, a certain official of the Chinese government said to others, "British friends have invited me to a banquet, but I cannot accept their invitation." From this, one can get a glimpse of the mood of the Chinese people here. (Dispatch of the 26th from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The newspapers here today prominently published President Chiang's remarks made on Sunday night, but because of the Japanese air raid that night, the morning newspapers were not published until the afternoon. All newspapers carried news of British Prime Minister Chamberlain reading the Anglo-Japanese compromise document in the House of Commons, but did not criticize this compromise. An editorial in the Chongqing United Daily News pointed out the reasons why Japan's economic war is bound to fail, saying that China has an economic system that is unparalleled in the world and extremely flexible, and can resist all attacks from the Japanese side.

<h3>Ambassador Gu Protests Anglo-Japanese Preliminary Agreement, Says it Conflicts with International Treaties; Britain's Concessions to Japan will Suffer the Consequences</h3>
<p>(Paris) Chinese Ambassador Dr. Gu Weijun recently issued a statement protesting the preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan, with solemn wording. Its main points are two: (1) This agreement conflicts with the Nine-Power Treaty, the Covenant of the League of Nations, the resolutions passed by the League of Nations Assembly and the Council, and the report of the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries' conference (held in Brussels, Belgium in November 1937). (2) Britain's spirit of concession is completely exposed, and this spirit is enough to hinder the foundation of general peace. The full text is excerpted as follows: Ambassador Gu first said that the Anglo-Japanese preliminary agreement is an "unpleasant surprise" for China, and the question of what Britain's true policy towards China is has also become a problem. This agreement, at least in its wording, does not distinguish between Japanese aggression and China's self-defense. "Britain is probably prepared to allow the aggressor country to act freely, while making the aggressed country obviously suffer. This attitude is difficult to reconcile with the Nine-Power Treaty, the Covenant of the League of Nations, the resolutions passed by the League of Nations Assembly and the Council, and the report of the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries' conference. "Britain has accepted solemn obligations to China in the above-mentioned international treaties, and now seems to have ignored them, at least for the time being." Or the Anglo-Japanese agreement has proved Britain's spirit of concession. "It is still remembered that the Japanese warlords had taken violent actions against British citizens among the nationals of all countries in Tianjin. The British government initially took a firm stand in principle, but now it is calm and at ease, abandoning its original stand, which is really surprising. Those innocent British men and women in Tianjin who entered and exited the British concession were deliberately ordered by Japanese soldiers to take off their clothes and be inspected, and their faces were slapped. At that time, Prime Minister Chamberlain also called it a 'humiliating outrage.' Now it is strange to reward it with an agreement. It is reasonable to assume that Britain has dried its face and once again yielded to the front of power. What is worrying is that this agreement will have a bad impact on the cause of peace, not only is it not enough to prevent aggression, but even in terms of Britain's efforts to build a peace front in Europe, it is not enough to strengthen the confidence of all countries. It is foreseeable that Britain's concessions to aggression in the Far East will suffer the consequences in Europe. "However, the Anglo-Japanese agreement may only be a compromise, in order to resolve the difficulties before the start of negotiations on the Tianjin incident, so its wording is ambiguous and can be interpreted differently, which is naturally inevitable. As for the true meaning of the agreement, it should be supplemented by how future negotiations will be, and how it is actually implemented in China as a shift. In short, empty words are not the final conclusion, and the key lies in actual action. Therefore, whether the new Anglo-Japanese agreement is the beginning of Britain's implementation of a new policy towards the Far East and towards China, there must be facts from the future to prove it. It is hoped that the general public in China, who are now worried about Britain's intentions, will eventually be proven wrong by the facts." (Dispatch of the 25th from Havas)</p>
<h3>The Muslim Relief Association Convened a Representative Conference; Dozens of Ministers and Officials from Various Ministries Attended; President Chiang Personally Attended and Delivered a Speech</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese Muslim National Salvation Association has been established for two years and has made many contributions to the war of resistance.

<h3>U.S. Protested Beating of American</h3>
<p>(Beijing) According to news here today, the U.S. Embassy has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Embassy because two Americans were slapped by Japanese sentries. One of them was an American Catholic priest, Father Stignauer, and the other was a physical education teacher at Fu Jen Catholic University, Smith Bijie. They were both attacked by Japanese sentries on Saturday. In addition to slapping, the two were also detained for a long time. When the Japanese sentries attacked the two, they threatened them with the guns in their hands. According to the two, on Saturday, when they were traveling to the Summer Palace and were about to enter a certain house, they were often stopped by Japanese sentries, who insisted on checking their passes. The two were then taken to the Japanese military camp. After the two entered the Japanese military camp, they were slapped by Japanese soldiers. Father Stignauer was first taken to the Japanese military camp by Japanese sentries and slapped by Japanese soldiers. Smith Bijie saw this and went to investigate, and was also slapped by Japanese soldiers. According to the Japanese military spokesman, this unfortunate incident will be resolved satisfactorily to the satisfaction of the United States. In short, this matter was purely a "misunderstanding." (Dispatch of the 26th from Associated Press)</p>

<p>(London) The House of Commons discussed the continued decline in the value of Chinese legal tender. Labor Party member Mr. Bellenger asked Finance Minister Simon whether he was aware of the continuous decline in the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender, and whether the equalization fund had been exhausted. Simon replied that the current status of the Chinese currency stabilization fund must be kept secret, as is the case with British or other foreign exchange stabilization funds. Mr. Bellenger should be aware of this. Bellenger continued, since the Finance Minister requested the House of Commons to vote in favor of using British taxpayers' money to maintain the stability of Chinese legal tender, the legal tender has depreciated by 50%. Does the Finance Minister intend to allow Chinese legal tender to find its own economic level? Simon replied that he could not add anything to his answer of July 11 to the last question. Labor Party member Mr. Noel-Baker asked the Finance Minister whether he could state unequivocally that for the sake of British interests, the British government considered it necessary to maintain the foreign exchange value of Chinese legal tender. Simon replied that he had stated in his previous reply to the House of Commons that no discussion of further action had been taken at present, and that he could not add anything to his previous answer, unless circumstances changed in other respects. Labor Party member Mr. Strauss asked whether the government would maintain its policy on the Chinese currency system. Simon replied that this question had not been submitted in writing and could not be answered immediately. Mr. Mander, a Liberal Party member of the opposition, asked whether the government had yielded to Japan in the Far East. Labor Party member Mr. Greenwood asked whether the government should find a way to prevent Chinese legal tender from falling further. Simon replied that this matter still required congressional approval. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Labor MP Strauss asked in the House of Commons today whether the Treasury had communicated with a certain bank with its headquarters in London about its branch in Shanghai allegedly cooperating with the Japanese authorities to weaken the Chinese foreign exchange stabilization fund. Finance Minister Simon replied that the Treasury had not done so. Strauss asked whether the Finance Minister meant that the Treasury had not contacted the bank in Shanghai. Simon replied that the question was whether the Treasury had communicated, and he replied that it had not, the meaning of which was clear. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The chief writer on financial matters for the London Times recently published a lengthy article discussing the Chinese currency issue. It stated, "The general public was originally concerned that the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo might directly involve the issue of Chinese legal tender, and that Japan might exert pressure to establish an agreement on this matter. At this point, this issue is clearly not being raised for discussion. Even in the initial agreement reached between the two countries, both sides retain complete freedom of action on this issue. However, how to proceed with maintaining legal tender in the near future is a matter of great uncertainty, even for experts familiar with Chinese financial and economic issues. However, as things stand, the pressure on legal tender in Shanghai has been reduced, and market participants even believe that the price of legal tender may rise somewhat. But the problem remains significant, and most people believe that the assistance needed to fully restore public confidence in legal tender must be greater than what was considered when the stabilization fund was established in order to be effective. Some say that stabilizing legal tender is a major undertaking, and if Britain does it alone without the United States coming forward to cooperate, it will not be easy. For the sake of protecting its trade with China, it is in the United States' best interest to have Chinese legal tender reasonably stable, which is also obvious. Unfortunately, as of now, there are very few signs of the United States coming forward to cooperate, which is quite strange. In short, if Britain intends to continue to assist legal tender, whether the United States comes forward to cooperate or not, it must fully consider one thing: the weakness of legal tender may be caused by fundamental economic forces."

<p>(Tokyo) The third meeting of the Anglo-Japanese Roundtable Conference was held this morning at 10:30 to address the report of the committee organized by two representatives from both Britain and Japan on maintaining peace and order in the British Concession in Tianjin. It is reported that the points of the report are as follows: (1) The extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng assassination case; (2) The thorough suppression of anti-Japanese elements; (3) The immediate dismissal of anti-Japanese personnel in the British Concession; (4) The strict censorship of anti-Japanese books and newspapers; (5) The prohibition of political activities opposing the new regime; (6) The employment of Japanese by the Concession Bureau to take up positions in police and judicial work; (7) The establishment of a cooperative mechanism between the Concession Bureau and the Japanese military authorities to facilitate the arrest of anti-Japanese terrorists (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources responsible for the conference, the Anglo-Japanese Roundtable Conference discussed the issue of maintaining peace and order in Tianjin today. It is reported that the representatives of both sides have reached an understanding on some points, while other points will be discussed tomorrow. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 7:30 PM that the third Anglo-Japanese conference was held from 10:30 AM to 1:20 PM on July 26, and again from 5:05 PM to 7:00 PM at the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs official. The committee's report was reviewed in detail, and progress was made in deliberating on issues such as the effective maintenance of security in Tianjin in the future. The fourth conference is scheduled to be held tomorrow, the 27th, at 9:45 AM. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning at 9:30, the Japanese representatives held a coordination meeting at the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs official. Those present included Minister Kato, Consul Tanaka, Director-General of the East Asia Bureau Kurihara, Chief of the Second Section Sugihara, and officials Aoki Asaumi and Kigaoka. On the military side were Major General Musu, Colonel Tatsumi, Lieutenant Colonel Yamamiki, and Major Ota. They reviewed the issues concerning the Tianjin security police discussed by the sub-committee on the 25th and dispersed after one hour. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When a foreign journalist asked the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons regarding Chinese sovereignty, the spokesperson replied that the Japanese army had never claimed sovereignty over the Chinese land it occupied. When the journalist further inquired about the issue of Anglo-Japanese compromise and the Nine-Power Treaty, the spokesperson replied that the Nine-Power Treaty was now devoid of vitality. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese observers here expect that the representatives attending the Anglo-Japanese conference will establish an agreement on maintaining peace and order in the British Concession in Tianjin this afternoon or tomorrow morning, and then discuss economic issues. After the talks in Tokyo are completed, a larger Anglo-Japanese conference will be reopened in Tianjin to discuss a detailed agreement. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, Foreign Minister Arita reported to the Privy Council the detailed progress of the talks in Tokyo, saying that the Anglo-Japanese conference was proceeding smoothly. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The third meeting of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations convened this morning at 10:00 AM and discussed for three hours. The main task was to present a report on the issue of maintaining security in the British Concession in Tianjin and to appoint a committee to study it. According to well-informed Japanese sources, the issues raised at this morning's meeting will be resolved at this afternoon's or tomorrow's meeting. Once the issues of an administrative nature are resolved, economic issues will be considered. It is said here that after reaching an agreement on basic principles regarding the Tianjin issue, Britain and Japan will continue to negotiate various pending issues in Tokyo, using the basic agreement as the basis for discussion. (Haitong, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) According to unconfirmed reports, the Japanese representative suggested at the meeting today that the Tianjin British Concession Bureau be reorganized, believing that the existing organization takes a hostile attitude toward Japan. It is said that the British representative rejected this on legal grounds. (Haitong, 26th) It is speculated that if the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo can reach a compromise, an Anglo-Japanese on-site conference will be held in Tianjin to discuss concrete cooperative strategies between Britain and Japan on security issues, as well as the implementation methods of the points decided upon by both parties on economic issues, in order to conclude the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<h3>Scope of Discussion Limited to Tianjin Local Incidents</h3>
<p>(London) Sources close to the government here recently declared that the agenda for the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo is currently being exchanged between the two sides. Once it is finalized, formal negotiations should begin. At that time, the discussion will be limited to purely local incidents in Tianjin: (1) The issue of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case; (2) The issue of cooperating with the Concession Police Department to punish terrorist activities and anti-Japanese activities based in the British Concession; (3) Certain financial issues within the British Concession, such as the issue of Chinese banks' deposits of 48 million Chinese currency. This item will be submitted for discussion last, and because France is also involved, it is expected that the country will send a representative to participate. Apart from these issues, Britain will refuse to discuss any other issues of a broader scope. When discussing the issue of deposits in the future, Britain will definitely not allow the Japanese side to raise general financial issues. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Prepared to Raise the Issue of the Chinese Currency System</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the Cabinet has decided that the issue of the Chinese currency system must be raised at the Anglo-Japanese Roundtable Conference. The Japanese side will pressure Britain to help collapse the Chinese legal tender, through four ways: (1) British cooperation to prohibit the circulation of legal tender in North China; (2) The British side will transfer Chinese deposits in the Tianjin British Concession to the Japanese side; (3) British cooperation to support the activities of the United Reserve Bank; (4) The British side will effectively manage the business of Chinese banks and private banks in the Tianjin British Concession. As for Central and South China, Japan has decided to request concrete cooperation from the local British authorities for the Huaxing banknotes. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Commander Honma's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Nazi Party's organ, the Völkischer Beobachter, carried the remarks of General Yamashita, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in North China (see separate telegram) in its first edition yesterday. However, the subsequent editions deleted these remarks and replaced them with the remarks of General Honma, commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, the content of which expressed skepticism about the future of Anglo-Japanese relations within China. It stated that "Communists hide in the Tianjin British Concession, beyond our reach, but these people are engaged in disrupting the actions of the Japanese army, which we cannot tolerate. Moreover, can we waste time circuitously discussing whether these people are guilty? In short, unless the various issues are resolved definitively, we will countermand the British Concession every day. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Nazi Party's organ, the Völkischer Beobachter, recently published remarks made by General Yamashita, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in North China, to a reporter from the newspaper. It stated that "The Japanese Army in North China will watch the progress of the negotiations between Britain and Japan on the Tianjin incident with an extremely calm attitude and the greatest attention. Within the scope of the new situation in the Far East, Britain must not demand more than it is entitled to. As far as the situation in North China is concerned, everything is completely in the hands of the Japanese army." It also stated, "The close cooperation between Germany and Japan is one of the most important realities in the world political situation." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Opinion: A Glimpse</h3>
<p>(London) British newspapers have commented extensively on the establishment of an agreement at the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. The Daily Telegraph's editorial stated that the principles established by Britain and Japan not only fail to reassure people, but also make them more uneasy, plunging them into a fog. The declaration that Japan has various privileges in China, which seem to be legitimate, and that this is in accordance with Britain's previous policy is utterly baffling. Whether Britain will continue to maintain the Chinese currency system and provide economic assistance to China remains to be proven. The Manchester Guardian commented that Britain is either deceiving itself or deceiving China, because Britain can never be bullied by Japan. The most obvious fact is that people do not understand the truth of this agreement, because the extent to which its wording is unclear is sufficient to make it insignificant. If Japan interprets this agreement to mean that this principle applies to the whole of China and believes that Britain has the possibility of cooperating with Japan, then China, Britain, and the United States will all suffer greatly. If the Japanese interpretation is not correct, then Britain should take remedial measures immediately and clearly state that it must support Chinese legal tender. The News Chronicle stated that the content of the Anglo-Japanese agreement is sufficient to prove that what the Japanese side claimed, that Britain has accepted the Japanese demands, is not false. If the British government wants to prove that the British interpretation is correct, it can provide China with a credit loan to show this. In any case, Britain should not take any policies that would hinder the implementation of the Chinese currency system. The Daily Express stated that if we want to stop Japanese aggression, closing our eyes and ignoring it will never work. At the same time, if we want to help China, it will not be successful by going in the opposite direction. The Times said that it is never easy to maintain friendly relations with a country at war. As far as Britain and Japan are concerned, maintaining friendly relations is impossible. Now that an agreement has been reached, at least it can temporarily avoid the two countries from taking an opposing stance. What is still unresolved is how to implement this agreement. (26th)</p>
<h3>Questions Raised in the British House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, the situation regarding the initial agreement between Britain and Japan was extremely turbulent. Opposition Labor MP Baker used a sarcastic tone to ask, "Japan is planning to restrict food supplies to Hong Kong, and in Shanghai, it is arresting British officials. Is this how Japan is repaying our country for the concessions it is making in the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement?" At this point, opposition MPs shouted to Prime Minister Chamberlain, "Answer quickly!" The Prime Minister only replied no. Opposition Labor MP Wedgwood asked, "After the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement was established, it caused a major reaction in Tokyo. Will Prime Minister Chamberlain pay attention to it?" The Prime Minister replied again, "I have nothing to add. Britain and Japan began negotiations in Tokyo on the 24th of this month. As of now, they have only discussed procedural issues and reviewed various facts." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Political circles here today completely shifted the responsibility for Britain's initial agreement with Japan to the United States. In other words, the reason why Britain is now seeking a solution with Japan is entirely due to the United States' lack of support for Britain. Britain is not only bearing the burden completely independently in the Far East, but at the same time, due to the failure to amend the US Neutrality Act, the indirect assistance it should have received is also absent. Currently, Britain and Japan have agreed to establish a border committee to determine a fact to deal with the matter. (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan on the Tianjin case is still a major topic of discussion in the Far East circles here. Cautious observers, including representatives of the North China business community, now feel more gratified. They compare the propaganda made by the Japanese newspapers and spokesmen at the time of the Arita-Craigie talks and the exaggerated claims that Britain would be forced to yield with the actual agreement, saying that the agreement does not indicate any fundamental change in British policy and that Britain has not undertaken anything other than what it has accepted. However, authors who oppose the agreement strongly reject this view, insisting that the agreement acknowledges Japan's right to engage in unjustified warfare in China and has become the basis for Japan to continue attacking British nationals and their industries whenever it deems it necessary. The Aid China Movement Committee is now planning a large-scale protest demonstration tomorrow, inviting Members of Parliament to convene a public gathering in the lounge and holding a large parade with placards and slogans in the West End of London. Authors on financial issues are studying the agreement from the perspective of continuing to aid China, and agree to pay attention to the stability of Chinese legal tender. The Financial Times wrote, "The Anglo-Japanese discussions are now limited to local incidents in Tianjin, which is a great improvement over the sweeping demands made by Japan originally to resolve all pending issues. It seems that we have now reached an agreement with Japan without losing our freedom of action towards China. The exercise of this freedom is an important matter, and there is an immediate point of contention, namely that the plan must not be allowed to affect Britain's attitude of supporting Chinese legal tender." The newspaper also published its views after reviewing China's trade status and China's new regulations restricting imports, saying that strengthening the foreign exchange fund is not the way to go, and that it will only throw good money into a bottomless pit. However, we must now devise a good strategy to prevent this money from indirectly falling into the hands of the Japanese. The Times also published its views in its local section, welcoming the fact that the Anglo-Japanese discussion avoided involving monetary issues and predicting that if we want to restore full confidence in Chinese legal tender, we must provide assistance on a larger scale than when the stabilization fund was established. It also emphasized that China should impose stricter controls on imports and encourage export trade. A reporter from the News Chronicle emphasized that the stabilization fund has not been exhausted, and that one of the least satisfactory aspects of its history is the enormous amount of this money, which is now believed to have been indirectly transferred into the hands of the Japanese. The newspaper also asked the public to pay attention to the recent trade agreement signed between China and the Soviet Union, and the plan implemented by the Chinese government to export products such as tea and tung oil from ports not controlled by the Japanese. Finally, it asked that China still holds extremely large reserves of gold and silver and foreign exchange, amounting to 20 million pounds, not including the 5 million pounds in the stabilization fund.

<h3>Italian Newspaper Mocks British Surrender</h3>
<p>(Rome) After the establishment of the preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan, the famous reporter Gayda (known as Mussolini's mouthpiece) commented on it in the semi-official Italian Daily, expressing his delight. He wrote that the British Empire had declared its surrender to Japan, but whether it was sincere was not yet certain, fearing that it might be a mysterious strategy, which must be guarded against. It is also heard that Britain may offer Japan a loan. In short, Britain cannot cope with both the Eastern European and Far Eastern fronts at the same time, and its encirclement policy has imposed a heavy burden. Britain has begun to realize all this, and has had to change its attitude. However, the impact on the Soviet Union and countries that have been secured or plan to be secured by Britain and France is bound to be a bad impression, which is only natural. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>The US Maintains Its Original Attitude on the Far East Issue; The US Does Not Intend to Recognize the Reality Created by Force</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the newspapers, saying that the US attitude has not changed since the outbreak of the Far East dispute, implying that it does not intend to recognize the reality created by force. He also said that the original text of the initial agreement reached between Britain and Japan in Tokyo has been sent to the State Department by the Japanese government, but the British government has not made any announcement. As for the blockade of the Pearl River by the Japanese military authorities, the US government's attitude will be no different from when the Pearl River was blockaded previously. In other words, the US will inform American expatriates to be cautious, but if an accident occurs that damages American interests, the Japanese authorities will still bear full responsibility. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The initial agreement reached between Britain and Japan in Tokyo has been commented on by political figures here, who all say that those in the US who oppose President Roosevelt's policy will become more eloquent. Isolationists all say that Britain and France retreat whenever a blade is put to their necks, and it is all harm and no benefit for the US to join forces with these countries. Among them, Republican Senator Johnson said that the fact that Congress refused to amend the existing Neutrality Act according to the government's wishes was a wise move, as evidenced by the establishment of the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement. US Congressmen have always been suspicious of the diplomatic methods of European countries, as can be seen from this. However, Secretary of State Hull made a statement this morning, still advocating a firm attitude towards Japan, which was approved by all in Congress, and emphasized that the US will definitely maintain the Open Door Policy in China and still refuse to recognize acts that violate international law.

<h3>Chen Jiageng Leads Eight Million Overseas Chinese in Appealing to Influential Figures in British Politics: Do Not Make Concessions to Japan and Fall from Your Prestige</h3>
<p>(Leading) Singaporean overseas Chinese tycoon Chen Jiageng, known for destroying his home to build schools, believes that Britain is trending towards making concessions to Japan in the negotiations in Tokyo, so in the name of eight million overseas Chinese, he has sent letters of advice to influential figures in British politics, warning Britain not to take steps that could affect its prestige, so as not to reduce the general public's confidence in Britain. It is said that former Foreign Secretary Eden, party leader Churchill, and other figures such as Lord Lytton, former Prime Minister Lloyd George, Sinclair, and Mr. Greenwood have all received this letter of protest.

<h3>Opening of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation: Budget Submitted for Discussion</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The second plenary session of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation opened today in the Kremlin. Many guests were present, such as Stakhanovites and shock workers from various factories in the city, representatives of intellectuals, members of the diplomatic corps, and domestic and foreign journalists. Party and government leaders Molotov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, Mikoyan, Shvernik, Malenkov, Shkiryatov, Bulganin, Badaev, Vyshinsky, Gorkin, all members of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation, and government officials took their seats in the boxes, and all the deputies and guests responded with enthusiastic cheers. The plenary session was opened by Speaker Zhdanov, and after the agenda was approved, the People's Finance Commissar of the Russian Federation, Umanov, reported on the state budget of the state for 1939 as follows:</p>
<p>"This year's budget reflects the strong development of our country's economy and culture. The revenue part is estimated to be 24,415,000,000 rubles, an increase of 12.6% over 1938. In the expenditure part, the expenditure on social and cultural undertakings reaches 16,052,200,000 rubles, of which education expenses are 9,473,000,000 rubles and health expenses are 4,831,000,000 rubles."

<h3>Sakhalin Oil Rights Dispute: Japanese Authorities Insist on Patience; Soviet Reply Under Study</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan lodged a protest with the Soviet government on April 20, opposing the Soviet Union's oppression of Japanese oil and coal concession rights in northern Sakhalin. It is now heard that the Japanese government has received a lengthy reply from the Soviet government and is currently studying it before taking new action. According to Japanese sources, the Soviet government threatened Japan that if it did not pay the fines judged by the local Soviet court by July 19, it would take back the Japanese concession rights. The Soviet government has not yet taken this action, and the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared today that the handling of the North Sakhalin issue must be done with great patience. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Mongolian Border Warfare: Japanese Exaggerated Propaganda</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Japanese source in Changchun, the Soviet-Mongolian army positions on the west bank of the Khalkhin River were fiercely attacked by Japanese artillery yesterday. The bombardment continued from morning until dusk, ceasing only when the Soviet-Mongolian forces stopped retaliating. Yesterday morning, the Kwantung Army issued a public statement claiming that 59 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft were shot down by Japanese forces on the 24th, with 17 shot down in the morning and the remaining 42 in the afternoon.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Malaya Boycott of Japanese Goods Effective: Significant Blow to Japanese Trade; Regarding Overseas Chinese in the Malay Archipelago</h3>
<p>A report on the boycott of Japanese goods by overseas Chinese, submitted by the British Trade Commissioner in Singapore to the Overseas Trade Department, has recently been published by the department. It states: "The large number of overseas Chinese in the Malay Archipelago are vigorously boycotting Japanese goods, with considerable success. The value of Japanese goods imported into the Malay Archipelago, calculated in Singapore dollars, was 40,482,000 in 1937, but decreased to 12,426,000 in 1938. Coal imports were halved, cement imports reduced by two-thirds, asbestos imports fell from 1,229 tons to 1 ton, cotton yarn and textiles fell in value from 7,406,000 to 2,787,000, woolen goods from 652,000 to 218,000, silk goods from 3,492,000 to 1,021,000, and copper, iron, and steel products from 3,361,000 to 305,000."

<h3>Britain and France Accept Soviet Proposal: Conduct Staff Talks First; Representatives of Both Countries to Go to Moscow Soon; Political Agreement Awaits Further Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London) Local newspapers recently reported that Britain has agreed to Moscow's request that staff talks between the British and Soviet armed forces should be held soon, without waiting for the detailed terms of a tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is now known in diplomatic circles that British staff representatives from the army, navy, and air force will soon depart for Moscow. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Staff talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will take place in the near future. According to the "Evening Standard," Britain's chief representative will be General Ironside, Inspector-General of Overseas Forces. "He fought against the Red Army in Arkhangelsk (a Soviet port on the White Sea) in 1919. Although he was an enemy of the Soviets, he now advocates British-Soviet cooperation. The Soviet authorities also prioritize pragmatism over old grudges, so they have not expressed any objections. This is noteworthy." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Sources close to the government here recently stated that a political agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is about to be concluded, and staff talks between the three countries can begin in Moscow within ten or twelve days, before the political agreement is finalized. According to reports, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov recently suggested to British Ambassador Seeds and French Ambassador Naggiar that the remaining difficulty in the tripartite political agreement was the definition of "indirect aggression." Before this issue is resolved, staff talks could be held first. Britain and France immediately expressed their agreement. Once the respective cabinets have approved, military representatives will be sent to Moscow within ten days. These representatives will include a French army general, a British naval officer, and several air force representatives from both countries. Regarding this matter, the British government plans to submit a report to the House of Commons tomorrow. In addition, regarding the definition of "indirect aggression," the government plans to send further instructions to Ambassador Seeds by telegram. It is said that the content offers further concessions to the Soviet Union, and the proposed approach is more flexible than previously heard. In short, now that Britain and France have accepted the Soviet proposal to hold staff talks, the Soviet Union should no longer insist on its own views regarding the definition of "indirect aggression." Prime Minister Chamberlain met with opposition Labour Party leader Greenwood this afternoon to discuss the issue of a mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is said that the Labour Party is very optimistic about the future of the tripartite talks. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Reports to the House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons this afternoon, saying, "The government sent new instructions to Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union last night. We hope to make an announcement regarding the latest situation in the negotiations in the early part of next week." Opposition Labour Party MP Dalton immediately asked, "Have all relevant parties agreed to the dispatch of British army and navy representatives to Moscow for talks?" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The government authorities have sent certain instructions to Ambassador Seeds, but we do not yet know the Soviet Union's reaction." Opposition Liberal Party MP Mander then asked, "Does the French government also intend to send a military delegation to Moscow?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Regarding the French government, I am not in a position to answer on their behalf. But I can assure the honorable member that the British and French governments are cooperating fully." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Do Not Attach Importance</h3>
<p>(Rome) Fascist circles here do not consider the rumored dispatch of British and French army, navy, and air force delegations to Moscow to discuss a military agreement with the Soviet Union to be important, but rather a method of self-consolation for the democratic countries. The British-French-Soviet agreement has been negotiated for months without success, so even if military delegations are sent, how can they achieve quick results? Furthermore, the eagerness of Britain and France to send military envoys shows that their desire to conclude this agreement is far stronger than that of the Soviet Union. Because of this, the Soviet Union may insist even more on its original demands. Moreover, this action by the British and French governments is also intended to demonstrate the results of their negotiations over the past few months. At least what Britain and France are currently seeking is a military agreement. At the same time, this action coincides with Britain's submission in the Far East, which is thought-provoking. Finally, this action is also intended to divert the public's attention from the Far East to other areas. (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<h3>Joint Strength of British and French Air Forces is Powerful; French Air Minister Delivers Speech in London; 200 British Aircraft Fly to France for Training</h3>
<p>(London) French Air Minister La Chambre, who arrived here yesterday, visited British Air Minister Wood this afternoon for a lengthy discussion. In the evening, he attended a banquet at the British branch of the Alliance Française, commemorating the late French aviator Blériot, and delivered a speech praising the strength of the British and French air forces and the size of their aircraft production. He said, "Considering the current aircraft production of Britain and France, the total number is comparable to that of a certain country that first expanded its air force, forcing other countries to join the competition and placing a heavy burden on all mankind. If necessary in the future, it can be expanded to more than double, because our current production capacity has not yet been fully utilized." British Air Minister Wood followed with a speech, saying, "British and French air force cooperation is close, more so than ever before. Our aircraft have repeatedly flown into French airspace, and we hope that the French government can also send aircraft to our country for training flights. All the facilities of Britain and France, and the powerful military force we are now creating, are solely for the purpose of maintaining peace, resisting aggression, and upholding justice and fairness. This is our only goal. In short, we not only absolutely do not threaten other countries, but also wish to live in friendship with all countries in the world. We hope that Britain and France can further expand the scope of cooperation in the future." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) This month marks the 30th anniversary of the late French aviator Blériot's flight across the English Channel. The British Air Ministry specially dispatched 240 aircraft, carrying 2,000 pilots, divided into several groups, flying to French airspace via different routes for a third training flight. Several French aircraft also took off from certain locations to join the flight. One team of British aircraft flew the farthest, covering a total distance of 2,600 kilometers round trip, without landing midway. Their average speed was 500 kilometers per hour. The aircraft of each team then successively flew back to their bases. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Danzig Situation: Britain Does Not Express Excessive Concern</h3>

<h3>Italian Army Scheduled to Hold Autumn Maneuvers Next Month</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Italian army units are scheduled to hold exercises in the Po Valley in northern Italy in early August. A German military delegation, led by Army Chief of Staff General Halder, is scheduled to visit from August 1st to 9th. According to military sources here, this trip has no political significance. The German army will also hold exercises, and will invite an Italian military delegation to visit at that time. However, the exercises have not yet been decided. In addition, Germany plans to hold joint army, navy, and air force exercises next year. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>Chamberlain Has Different Views</p>
<h3>Dark Future for British-French-Soviet Alliance; Shudi; British Foreign Secretary Uses Resignation Threat Unsuccessfully; Chamberlain Firmly Rejects Churchill's Inclusion in the Cabinet</h3>
<p>London News: In this world, due to different standpoints and interests, there are forces that promote the ongoing British-French-Soviet alliance, forming a driving force, and there are forces that hinder it, forming a countercurrent force. These two aspects of power are multifaceted, and it is naturally impossible to describe them all at once. What I want to talk about here is the most important force in Europe that is currently preventing the establishment of this alliance.</p>
<p>This force is none other than the "Chamberlain Cabinet!"</p>
<p>It seems that the tone of criticizing the "Chamberlain Cabinet" has been too high and too frequent this year. As a result, some well-meaning people are gradually beginning to doubt whether these criticisms are credible, and whether the critics themselves have ulterior motives. In fact, judging from the actual evolution of the situation, any observer with some insight here agrees that the force criticizing the "Chamberlain Cabinet" has only been too weak and insufficient over the past year, and has not been excessive in the slightest. The British-French-Soviet alliance, which has been in progress for several months without any concrete results, is the most appropriate example.</p>
<p>It may be hard for some people to believe, but the ironclad and ruthless fact is that as of this writing, July 14, 1939, Prime Minister Chamberlain is still stubbornly adhering to his so-called "appeasement" policy and refuses to admit any mistakes. In recent days, even some people in Britain who are known as "die-hards" have recognized the current crisis facing Britain and recognized that, apart from the British-French-Soviet alliance, British diplomacy has no other way out. However, when they conveyed their awakened opinions to Chamberlain, they were resolutely rejected. As a result, these awakened "die-hards" had no choice but to reach a conclusion: "The Chamberlain Cabinet is beyond redemption." Therefore, two weeks ago, these people's slogan was still to reorganize and adjust the current cabinet. Now, even their greatest hope has to be placed on the next general election, and they are moving towards overthrowing the current cabinet.</p>
<p>What are the excuses currently used by Chamberlain and his ilk to oppose the British-French-Soviet alliance? According to what I know here, in the past few days, the ones they have been mentioning the most are nothing more than these: (1) The future value of the Soviet Union to Britain and France in military terms is, at best, purely "defensive" and has absolutely no positive effect. Therefore, "it is really not worth haggling with Comrade Stalin any further." (2) The most we want from the future role of Soviet Russia is merely to supply military equipment to Poland. Well, the current situation is already sufficient. Why should we have to rely on the "whims" of Soviet Russia? (3) Regarding the matter of guaranteeing the independence and integrity of the Baltic Sea states, if the countries concerned themselves are unwilling to accept guarantees, then Britain "absolutely cannot automatically guarantee it." Why? Chamberlain said, "This is interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. We have criticized Hitler for the same reason, and we ourselves cannot naturally commit the same mistake again," and so on.</p>
<p>As reasons for opposing such a major event as the British-French-Soviet alliance, the fragility of these superficial excuses is obvious. Therefore, in recent days, it seems that there has been little debate in Britain with Chamberlain and his ilk from a positive standpoint. The problem now is clearly and simply placed before all the people of Britain: (1) Can the "Chamberlain Cabinet" change its course? Chamberlain has firmly answered "no" to this. Then, continuing on, (2) Can the current cabinet be reorganized to achieve the goal of changing the diplomatic course? This plan has also been fundamentally rejected by Prime Minister Chamberlain. Thus comes the third question, (3) Can a general election be held on schedule to improve the current situation?</p>
<p>These three consistently interlinked questions are a summary of the facts and provide a general explanation of the trend. Here, I would like to briefly describe a few concrete facts.</p>
<p>The core that directs current British diplomacy lies in the so-called "inner cabinet" within the British cabinet. The "inner cabinet" currently consists of four giants: Prime Minister Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Home Secretary Hoare, and Foreign Secretary Halifax. If we believe that the current British cabinet has recently given everyone some hope of a "change of course," then the origin of this glimmer of hope comes from Foreign Secretary Halifax. However, Halifax's advocacy, after reaching the alliance with Poland, the alliance with Turkey, and the guarantee to Romania and Greece, encountered a setback in negotiations with the Soviet Union. But even now, if Halifax were allowed to continue unimpeded, then, after considerable twists and turns, the British-French-Soviet alliance would probably still be established in the end. However, at this time, taking advantage of the temporary setback, Simon and Hoare ridiculed Halifax as much as possible. The one who vehemently opposed the British-Soviet rapprochement was Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. Therefore, Halifax has consistently been fighting a lonely battle in the "inner cabinet." His support comes from the majority of cabinet members and the broad British public.</p>
<p>It is said that Halifax is staking everything on his own position regarding his own views, using his resignation as a last resort. In other words, if his views cannot be realized, then he intends to resign from his position as Foreign Secretary. But judging from the current atmosphere in the British so-called "inner cabinet," it is extremely difficult for his views to be realized smoothly. Perhaps the most that can be achieved is to prevent Chamberlain's "appeasement" policy from being repeated, which would already be very good.</p>
<p>From the beginning of April to the end of June, after nearly three months of Halifax fighting a lonely battle in the cabinet, everyone knows that it is highly unlikely that the current cabinet will fundamentally change its course. Thus, around the last ten days of June, a wave of calls for reorganizing the current cabinet suddenly surged in Britain. The initial proposal was for Churchill, Eden, and former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper to join the cabinet at the same time. Later, as a preliminary arrangement, Halifax arranged a meeting between Eden and Chamberlain. At that time, Eden had just returned from a trip to France, and his opinions were also filled with the opinions of French leaders regarding the British-French-Soviet alliance. The result of this meeting was probably not very good, because since then, the calls for Eden to join the cabinet have suddenly subsided.</p>
<p>In this way, up until about two weeks ago, a movement to concentrate support for Churchill's entry into the cabinet suddenly erupted.</p>
<p>It can be said that the strength of this pro-Churchill movement was unprecedentedly concentrated and vigorous. Apart from the broad British public, almost all British newspapers and opinion organizations were making loud appeals. Needless to say, Halifax, even Eden and Cooper, who themselves had hopes of joining the cabinet, temporarily abandoned their efforts in their own political careers and openly stood up, voicing their support for Churchill's entry into the cabinet. The majority of members of Parliament stood on Churchill's side. Even Lady Astor, the hostess of the "Cliveden Set," stood up for the first time "in history" to support inviting Churchill to join the cabinet. In all of these aspects, the public opinion of both the United States and France was also mobilized. Churchill's name was echoing everywhere: in movie theaters, in advertisements, on the radio, and in Parliament.</p>
<p>But what is the result of this movement after two weeks? Just two days ago, when someone suggested to Chamberlain that Churchill should replace Stanhope as First Lord of the Admiralty, Chamberlain immediately rejected it.</p>
<p>"Why?" It is said that Chamberlain retorted angrily, "I will never commit suicide and end my personal political life by inviting him to come and foment a cabinet overthrow movement."</p>
<p>Metaphorically speaking, the movement to support Churchill's entry into the cabinet is currently surging like a raging torrent, while the "Chamberlain Cabinet" stands like a lonely reef, resisting the impact from all directions in the whirlpool of the giant waves.</p>
<p>However, the lessons of the past two weeks have finally led the general public in Britain to a conclusion that the only salvation in the future lies in a large-scale movement to overthrow the cabinet. Therefore, they have placed their hopes on the next general election.</p>
<p>Therefore, Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz recently said to many people in one place, "During Prime Minister Chamberlain's tenure, it is feared that the British-Soviet alliance will be very difficult to establish quickly, and will only be delayed like this." Thinking about it, there is a lot of truth in that.</p>
<p>The remaining question is whether the British general election in November of this year will be held on schedule.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, the general election is probably planned to be held on schedule. Both the ruling and opposition parties are making preparations for the general election. However, there is still a danger here, which is that if Chamberlain believes that holding it at that time would be unfavorable (he himself had already planned to retire; the problem lies with his ilk). Then, it is also hard to say whether there might be a temporary postponement. In that case, the British movement to overthrow the cabinet would truly need to make even greater efforts.</p>

<p>Sexual Health</p>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<h3>Why Does Love Become Dark and Painful?</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that sexual love between men and women is full of infinite light and unparalleled joy. However, if physical health is impaired, leading to defects in love, then this light and joy immediately turn into darkness and pain. In particular, for men, the strength or weakness of their bodies almost determines their happiness or suffering in the conduct of love, and even the joy and sorrow of their wives are invariably affected by the husband's physical strength.</p>
<p>To measure one's own physical strength, one only needs to see if reproductive function is healthy, and whether there are any signs of local weakness. In addition, if one feels soreness in the joints and fatigue throughout the body after sexual activity, which does not recover until the next day, these are clear signs of physical weakness.</p>
<p>A clever, lively, and affectionate young woman, unfortunately married to such a husband, because she cannot obtain the joy of love, harbors deep dissatisfaction with her husband. The love between the two gradually becomes cold, until it eventually ruptures. In court, we often hear such complaints of divorce, and this is not a fictitious story by the author.</p>
<p>If the husband's weakness continues unabated, they must actively study it to see if there is hope of a cure. All methods that can promote health must be followed one by one, such as short-term abstinence, careful diet, attention to exercise, and avoidance of overwork. Then, apply targeted therapy, and they may not immediately regain their health.</p>
<p>There are many causes of weakness, the most common being seminal emission and spermatorrhea, which greatly damage the youth gland that governs sexual power. However, in order to make this youth gland flourish again and thoroughly treat the above-mentioned conditions, one should actively take the testicular endocrine agent for men, "Butikeong," which is the best of endocrine agents. It can enhance overall nutrition, revitalize weakened energy, promote development, nourish the brain, and nourish the kidneys. The medicinal effect begins in one hour, and generates sperm and nourishes the kidneys in 24 hours, so there is no fear of disappointment after taking it. Although reproductive function is a duty that couples should fulfill, if it is indulged in excessively, it will be harmful rather than beneficial. Excessive sexual desire can weaken a man's energy and also exhaust women. Therefore, for those who indulge in licentiousness, the activity of their functions must also decline. To prevent premature aging, supplementing with "Butikeong" is quite effective. The female "Butikeong" functions to regulate menstruation and promote fertility.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>Remedy for Mental Fatigue</h3>
<p>— By American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Mental fatigue is most easily felt in the summer heat. Originally, a person’s spirit, if the work is not excessively overburdening, can always maintain a normal state. However, the work of ordinary people exceeds their original working hours, and they do not rest; then, a kind of fatigue toxin easily develops in their bodies, and they feel very tired. This is the cause of fatigue.</p>
<p>However, this is the situation for ordinary people. Many people with extraordinary endowments have much stronger endurance than ordinary people, and conversely, people with weak physiques are easily tired even if they do not do excessive work.</p>
<p>For people who are easily mentally fatigued, their nerves must also be very easily weakened, causing headaches, aversion to things, and extreme dislike of work. They are highly sensitive, so they are also prone to pessimism. Such patients cannot taste the true pleasures of life, and their careers cannot achieve anything. Patients feel even worse in the summer, because in the summer, the appetite of such delicate bodies is also weakened, so nutrition becomes even more inadequate, and the body feels even more unsupported.</p>
<p>To remedy this mental fatigue, mental distraction, and inability to concentrate, the only thing to do is to take German “Bu Ti Kang”. This agent is made from youthful glands as raw material under purple light electricity using scientific methods, so it does not lose the original fresh and lively youthful vitality. After taking it, it can invigorate the spirit and promote appetite, and it can help the development of youthful glands, enhance brain power, concentrate thinking power, and memory. Taking it in summer makes the body tireless, increases work efficiency, and clears the head and eyes. As for sexual neurasthenia, masturbation, excessive sexual activity, leading to impotence, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, etc., “Bu Ti Kang” has even more extraordinary and saintly effects. Therefore, doctors in various countries have an excellent clinical impression of “Bu Ti Kang”.</p>
<h3>Latest Holy Medicine for Treating Lung Diseases</h3>
<p>— By Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>There are many treatments for lung diseases, but there has never been a specific medicine that can cure them completely. Since ancient times, countless unfortunate lung disease patients have been sacrificed under the phrase "no specific medicine." Recently, with the development of science, medicine has made rapid progress, and the treatment of lung diseases has also made significant progress. The medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" was invented under the impetus of science. This agent has proven to be effective in a short period of time for lung diseases in various stages, and it can gradually reduce the hollow parts of the lungs until they are as flat as ever. Therefore, "Bu Fei Na Er" is considered the best internal medicine for lung diseases. This is truly not an exaggeration. For various coughs before consumption develops, taking "Bu Fei Na Er" can suppress coughs and stop coughing within three hours.</p>
<h3>Spermatorrhea Cured Case: The Evil Consequences Caused by Pornographic Books and Pictures</h3>
<p>— By German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>The patient, Ju Ming, is 24 years old, a local resident. (Self-reported) — When he was developing at the age of sixteen, his feelings gradually opened up, and he collected countless pornographic books and pictures, reading them morning and night, even to the point of not thinking about eating or drinking. Furthermore, he was seduced by bad friends, and masturbation began. When he first committed masturbation, he only knew the momentary pleasure, but he did not expect that it would become a habit. He committed it every night. Soon, he felt distracted, and his dreams of intercourse increased. After three years, he suddenly felt that his face was thin and his spirit was insufficient. At that time, he had a little knowledge and knew that it would endanger his life, so he was horrified and abstained. However, spermatorrhea occurred frequently. At first, he only had four or five dream emissions per month, but later it became spermatorrhea, and eventually it became one emission per day, and his body became terribly thin, his memory became weak, he suffered from insomnia and dizziness, he was drowsy all day, his back ached, and he suffered all kinds of pain, and his development was thus hindered, and his sexual organs became unusually small. Because his wedding date was approaching, he was extremely anxious and requested immediate treatment. (Current symptoms) — His spermatic duct is loose, his sexual nerves are weak, and his reproductive glands are irreparably damaged. (Treatment method) — First, he was given “Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Pills”, and then male and female "Bu Ti Kang" to consolidate the spermatic duct and replenish the losses. At the same time, electrotherapy was applied to restore the sexual nerves to a normal state. After two months of treatment, spermatorrhea disappeared, his body recovered, and his development was also sufficient.</p>
<p>New Words on Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>The Causes and Consequences of Urethral Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Sichuan Road Intersection</p>
<p>Once infected with gonorrhea, the initial gonococci mostly parasitize in the anterior urethra. At this time, if the gonococci are swept away with lightning speed, then the gonococci that have not yet gained a foothold will have no way to struggle and will be wiped out in one fell swoop. However, if these bacteria are not eliminated at this time, all the pathological changes will arise from this. Generally, gonococci in the anterior urethra are commonly seen in the prodromal period of gonorrhea. When it enters the acute phase from the prodromal phase, the gonococci are no longer limited to the anterior urethra but also cross into the posterior urethra. All the symptoms are even more numerous, and treatment is more difficult than in the prodromal stage. The reason why gonorrhea caused by gonococci in the anterior urethra is easy to eradicate is that the anterior urethra has no complicated structure physiologically. Therefore, it is very easy to treat. If the gonococci have invaded the posterior urethra, although treatment is more difficult, if the gonococci have not yet invaded the urinary system, internal reproductive system, and blood circulation system, a radical cure is still not very difficult. However, if it has become gonococcal cystitis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., it is tantamount to indicating that the patient's gonorrhea has invaded these systems. Its treatment is not only more difficult than anterior urethritis, but also more difficult than posterior urethritis. All of the above are the causes and consequences of untreated gonococcal urethritis. And the only treatment is to take the special medicine for gonorrhea, "Ke Lin Nong," in order to have the hope of eradication. Because if the gonococci spread from the anterior urethra to the three major systems, the scope of the gonococci is wide, and it is absolutely impossible to complete the task of driving away the gonococci with a local operation of one branch and one section. I further assist with German static electricity therapy, so that the bactericidal power of "Ke Lin Nong" can be fully exerted. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting from today, 20 patients will be seen daily. Each number costs only five dimes and includes a copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan.</p>

<h3>The Exchange Stabilization Fund Will Not Be Maintained, and Foreign Exchange Will Be Unavailable; Maintaining the Exchange Market Does Not Benefit the Chinese; Yesterday, HSBC Further Reduced Supply</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange black market, due to rampant speculation and manipulation by speculators, caused prices to plummet. After the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and HSBC made every effort to supply it, it gradually stabilized. Yesterday morning, HSBC posted its prices as before, that is, British currency at four pence and American currency at seven yuan and seventy-five cents. However, it was rumored in the market that the Exchange Stabilization Fund would no longer maintain the Shanghai black market and would allow it to take its natural course. Therefore, the black market foreign exchange shrank again, but because speculators exited after profiting, the shrinkage was not very severe. The actual market price was British currency at four pence and twenty-five cents and American currency at eight yuan and twenty-five cents. It was also heard that the British HSBC Bank, in addition to those with legitimate needs in various industries, would not allow supply yesterday morning. As for the government's foreign exchange for non-occupied areas, it will still be fully maintained. For example, for the import of necessities, one can apply to the Central Bank for purchasing statutory foreign exchange. The statutory foreign exchange market price announced by the Central Bank has always been the same and has not changed. Because maintaining the Shanghai black market foreign exchange does not benefit Chinese merchants and people at all, and only helps the Japanese maintain their financial life.</p>
<p>Securities Gray Market Rises Again Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Securities in the gray market unified various bonds, because the banking sector confirmed that the principal and interest due at the end of July were discounted and borrowed by the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture. Therefore, the price rose again. Yesterday morning's closing prices were: Type A, 52 yuan, up 3 dimes; Type B, 43 yuan and 45 cents, up 1 dime and 5 cents; Type C, 42 yuan and 35 cents, up 3 dimes and 5 cents; Type D, 41 yuan and 6 dimes, up 6 dimes; Type E, 41 yuan and 9 dimes, up 3 dimes and 5 cents.</p>
<p>Gold Rises Slightly, Discount Unchanged</p>
<p>The gold gray market meeting place opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The morning closing price was 3,760 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 3,795 yuan, which was 125 yuan higher than the previous evening's closing price. The price posted by the silver shops was 380 yuan, which was 10 yuan higher than the price posted the previous day. As for the exchange discount, it was 230 yuan yesterday, which was the same as the previous day. The businesses engaged in this discount business were generally small money shops, but the member banks and shops of the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association did not engage in exchange discounts.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou and Fuzhou Bombed Again</h3>
<p>Claiming to Implement Military Actions, Losses Were Significant but Had No Impact</p>
<p>According to information obtained from the shipping industry: (1) On the morning of the 25th, at about 9:00 AM, six Japanese aircraft invaded Wenzhou to drop bombs, and bombed Leqing and other places. The Chinese side suffered minimal losses. At the same time, three Japanese aircraft scouted Zhenhai, but did not drop bombs. (2) On the 14th, at 2:00 PM, three Japanese aircraft dropped six bombs in Fuzhou, and dropped seven or eight bombs in Changmen and other places. The losses are unknown.</p>
<h3>Money Shops Apply for Exchange Allocations in Succession</h3>
<p>Can Be Completed in Two Days</p>
<p>The new exchange allocation of 25 million yuan for each commercial bank, the total amount of assumed chips, was completely allocated by the Executive Committee of the Banking Association according to the amount of funds needed by each bank in its daily business. It is heard that collateral does not have to be provided in advance at present. When the new exchange allocation ticket is used, collateral must be provided according to the face value of the ticket. Regarding the assumed exchange allocation chip amount of 10 million yuan for money shops, the Money Industry Association has notified the 41 member shops in the north and south of the city on the 24th to declare the amount of funds they need to receive for allocation. Each shop has complied and reported to the association starting yesterday. The total number has not yet been counted. The member shops that have not reported will continue to handle the procedures today.</p>
<h3>Transshipment of Miscellaneous Grains Is Exempt from Tax Across the Board</h3>
<p>Implemented in Western Zhejiang, One Tax for Each Item</p>
<p>The Customs Regulations on Transshipment Tax stipulate that the tax-exempt items among miscellaneous grains and their products are rice, wheat, and wheat. From now on, bran, wheat, sorghum, corn, millet, soybean cake, cottonseed cake, peanut cake, rapeseed cake, other seed cakes, unnamed miscellaneous grain flour, etc., from No. 45 to No. 54, will all be allowed to be exempt from tax to show consideration. All customs offices have been ordered to comply. In addition, the Western Zhejiang Tax Bureau stipulates that only one type of special consumption tax is levied in the counties in the war zone, including liquor, local yellow wine, local tobacco leaves, local silk, sugar, cigarettes, table salt, matches, kerosene, etc. All other taxes originally levied in other counties will be abolished. Currently, taxation has begun in Yuhang, Fuyang North Bank, Wukang, Deqing, Wuxing, Hangzhou City County, Haiyan, Haining, Jiaxing, and other counties, and has been quite effective. Because there is only one tax on each item, it will not be taxed repeatedly after passing through the counties in the war zone, which is said to be convenient.</p>
<h3>Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce Protests the Anglo-Japanese Agreement; The Insults Suffered by Tianjin Are No Less Than Being Recognized; British Prestige and Interests Are Hit</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th. The China Association here recently received a telegram from the Shanghai Branch and the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce, protesting the initial Anglo-Japanese Agreement, stating: "In our view, the result of this agreement will see Britain abandon its rights and obligations in China, which is regrettable. The various insults suffered by British expatriates in Tianjin, which Prime Minister Chamberlain deemed unbearable, have also been recognized. Moreover, if this agreement is not clearly defined and restricted, it is tantamount to granting broad rights to the Japanese military authorities, allowing them to interpret it at will and subjecting Britons to their control now and in the future. In short, we believe that this agreement is a sign of Britain abandoning its duties, obligations, and legal status in China. As a result, Britain's honor, prestige, and its interests in China will be hit."</p>
<h3>Business Trends After the Coastal Areas Are Blockaded</h3>
<p>British Shipping Companies Are Shifting Their Focus to Southeast Asia</p>
<p>After the war, national ships on the Northern Shipping Line were forced to suspend operations, and British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships were repeatedly obstructed, only barely maintaining the Shanghai-Qingdao-Yantai-Tianjin route. However, Japanese Nisshin, Dairen, Yamashita, Osaka Shosen, and International companies have now made every effort to expand and monopolize the shipping industry in North China. In addition, they have acquired the Zhengji Company's ships and leased Chinese ships exclusively for the North China routes.</p>
<p>On the Southeast Asian route, Japanese warships, under the pretext of military operations, attempted to blockade the ports of Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xinghua, Sandu'ao, and Shacheng, and arbitrarily detained and inspected foreign ships along the coast, hindering navigation. As a result, those who barely sailed saw a sharp decrease in passengers and cargo, and their business declined. The ports of Shantou, Fuzhou, and Wenzhou are important lifelines for British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson's regular voyages. Now, on the surface, the ships are still docked in Shantou, but in reality, they have all stopped importing. As for Quanzhou, although British ships still send ships to sail, there is only one flight every week or within a week. Xiamen is already an occupied area, and freight and passenger transport are extremely scarce. British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson and other companies, in addition to barely maintaining the main shipping lines in North and South China, have mostly changed to the South China Sea routes such as Guangzhou Bay, Haiphong, and Lolo. Taking Guangzhou Bay as an example, in addition to the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships, there are Chen Ping Pacific, represented by He Fa Cheng; Haicheng, represented by De Jishi; Changan, represented by Changan; Yongcheng, Yonghe, and Yonghua, represented by Da You; Dabaoshi, represented by Shunchang; and Liantong Chaozhou, represented by Jieshun. On average, there are at least two ships daily traveling between Hong Kong and Guangzhou Bay. As for the ships sailing to Haiphong, Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have the most. The Siam line, which was newly opened by Taikoo Company, is a direct flight from Shanghai to Bangkok in Siam.</p>
<p>Sailing Ship Rescued After Being Hit by a Hurricane Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Tong Chunxun, the compradore of the Swedish Ruifeng Foreign Firm's Xin Anli ship, after being released by the Japanese, took a sailing ship from Dinghai to Shanghai on the 17th. On the 19th, it encountered a windstorm, and more than 30 people on the ship disappeared. For many days, everyone thought it had capsized and sunk to the bottom of the sea, and there was no hope of survival. Unexpectedly, the sailing ship suddenly arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 PM on the 25th. The sailors said that after being hit by the hurricane, they lost their driving ability and drifted to Xiaoyangshan. The tailwind brought them to Xinyangshan, and the wind weakened slightly before they were able to land. It was not until the 23rd that the Xin Anli ship, which had been sent to find them, came to Shanghai from there. All 30-plus people on the ship were able to celebrate their rebirth.</p>
<h3>Run on Currency Subsides, Value of Legal Tender Increases; Government's Full Maintenance Has Achieved Obvious Results; Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan Banknotes Are Mostly Remitted to the Mainland</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance decided to fully maintain the value of legal tender, sufficient preparations were also made for the legal tender in the occupied areas. The policy of issuing legal tender is cautious, and the cash reserve has always been above 60 percent. After the regulations for the acceptance and exchange of Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan local banknotes were established, the run on currency in Shanghai has subsided, and remittances to the mainland have surged. At the same time, banks are also trying to transfer funds to the mainland. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Run on Currency Completely Subsides</p>
<p>After banks and shops in Shanghai refused to accept banknotes with Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan place names, holders of banknotes flocked to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to request exchange. After the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications stipulated acceptance and exchange methods, those holding Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan banknotes all changed to requesting remittances to the mainland from the banks. The banks did not charge any remittance fees for remittances. As a result, yesterday, the number of people requesting remittances to the mainland from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications surged. Banknotes with place names other than Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan are still commonly used in the market at full value. Therefore, the run on currency has completely subsided, market rumors have disappeared, and people's hearts are at peace.</p>
<p>Encourage the Transfer of Funds to the Mainland</p>
<p>Shanghai is facing the risk of oversupply due to the concentration of funds. Improper speculative business operations have occurred in the market, such as foreign exchange arbitrage, buying and selling of foreign currencies, gold, and stocks, as well as hoarding of various commodities and renting and building of real estate and houses. To prevent speculation, prevent soaring prices, and affect people's livelihood, banks are strictly handling loans secured by goods, etc., and are trying to transfer surplus funds to the mainland to help the government develop the rich resources of the southwest and northwest, in line with the wartime financial policy. In addition, people are encouraged to remit funds to the mainland, and no remittance fees are charged.</p>
<p>Deposits in Banks and Shops Have Increased</p>
<p>Banks and money shops in Shanghai had a deposit run in early last month. After the Ministry of Finance's restriction by telegram, it subsided. Recently, the financial market has stabilized, and the organization of banks and money shops has become more sound. As a result, depositors have redeposited the money they had previously withdrawn into the banks and shops. Therefore, the new deposits in the banks and shops have increased. The public has a deep understanding of the government's measures to stabilize finance, and depositors are unwilling to withdraw because the money deposited in the banks and shops earns interest, at least 4 percent for current accounts.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Land on Nanri Island Outside Xinghua Port, Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 25th, three Japanese warships arrived at Nanri Island outside Xinghua Port. They first lowered speedboats and patrolled. At about 9:00 AM, they fired artillery shells at the shore. More than 100 Japanese troops, riding speedboats, attempted to land under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese garrison was prepared and responded calmly. The Japanese troops failed to succeed. There are still seven or eight Japanese warships off the mouth of the Minjiang River, but there have been no other movements.</p>
<h3>Selling Rice Above the Price Limit, Authorities Send Police to Arrest</h3>
<p>Jiuda Rice Shop Sold Rice Above the Limit Price in the Market Yesterday; Shop Owner Wang Youren Was Detained by the French Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Intelligence Department of the Public Works Department issued a message stating that recently there have been rumors in the market that the Public Works Department will relax the price limit on domestic rice. This statement is absolutely untrue. The authorities of the two concessions strictly enforce the stipulated prices, that is, the highest quality white rice should not exceed 20 yuan per stone on average, and the highest quality Rongxian rice should not exceed 16 yuan per stone. Yesterday (the 26th) morning, Jiuda Rice Shop, located at No. 780 Julai Road, was selling domestic rice in the Sima Road rice market for 22 yuan per stone. The Chinese and Western police officers stationed in the market noticed it and reported the facts to their superiors. The shop owner and manager of the rice shop, Wang Youren, has now been detained by the French Municipal Council. At the same time, the council sent police officers to the rice shop to monitor the rice sales and ordered the highest quality white rice in stock to be sold below the limit price of 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Reports to the Concession Authorities</p>
<p>Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang, Committee Members of the Soybean Rice Industry Association, Fu Qian Geng, Director of the Market Management Committee, Zhang Nianxuan, Chairman of the Rice Shop Industry Association, and four others went to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to meet with Deputy Director He De Kui to report on the market transaction situation, the ban on rice in various places, and the amount of Shanghai Concession reserves, and requested the Concession authorities to make every effort to dredge the source to maintain the overall food supply in Shanghai. They left at about 4:00 PM. It is heard that the Concession authorities are determined to maintain the food supply, so there is no need to worry about the future.</p>
<p>Trying to Negotiate the Ban on Transportation in Various Places</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading situation in the rice market was still chaotic. Goods such as white japonica, early japonica, thin rice, and premium rice were not sampled, only four types of white yuan, winter frost, sheep tip, and brown tip had transactions, totaling only five or six thousand bags. The prices of various types of rice have all risen to the top, and there have been secret transactions. After the manager of Jiuda Rice Shop was arrested by the French police for exceeding the price limit, speculators in the market were slightly wary. It is expected that the rice price may stabilize slightly starting this morning. Furthermore, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met with a leader of the rice industry yesterday, who said that Wuhu, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places have successively banned rice from leaving the country, so that the rice from the above-mentioned places has disappeared from Shanghai. However, rice from the Songjiang area can still be transported to Shanghai. Yesterday, 1,000 bags arrived. Negotiations are currently underway in the banned areas.</p>
<p>Market Announcement: Strictly Comply with the Price Limit</p>
<p>The Soybean Rice Market Management Committee issued Announcement No. 77 in the market, stating that the authorities of the Special Zone restricted rice prices, and the association had long ago issued a notice to comply. Now, the previous case is reiterated, and it is resolved that the fresh white japonica without bags or over a Dou should not exceed 19 yuan and 70 cents per stone, and the shrinkage should be 19 yuan and 50 cents. The remaining goods should be valued separately. It is hoped that everyone will respect and comply. If anyone dares to violate it, they will be responsible for any accidents that occur. The association is not responsible for any responsibility. I hereby announce it again, and I hope that all merchants and customers will be informed.</p>

<h3>After the Terrorist Attack, Newspaper Security Is Increased; French Police Guard Near Da Mei; The Editorial Department of Zhong Mei Is Converted into a Bomb Shelter</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that, in order to prevent the recurrence of the terrorist atrocities that occurred on Saturday and Sunday, the French Concession authorities ordered workers to quickly build a permanent guardhouse on the empty space at the corner of Rue des Soeurs and Avenue Edward VII this morning (the 26th). Barbed wire fences were also placed around the side door and back door of the Da Mei Evening News building.

He left close to noon. After the discussion, no official announcement was issued, but it was heard that the lieutenant colonel had guaranteed to Gauss that Hollen was now living peacefully in the Nanchang Hospital and discussed sending an American to Nanchang to investigate the matter, but no definitive conclusion was reached. When the reporter asked Gauss last night, he only admitted that a Japanese military officer and a member of the consulate staff had visited Hollen for talks yesterday morning and was unwilling to say anything else.</p>

<h3>Broadway Mansion: Newly Opened Magnificent Casino; Gamblers are Wealthy Puppet Chinese; Operated by Beauties and White Russian Jews</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the skyscraper Broadway Mansion, located on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, was purchased by Chinese puppets and Japanese businessmen at the beginning of this year. It is now heard that a magnificent casino has been newly opened on the 18th floor of the building, making all the gambling dens established after the Japanese army occupied the city in November of the year before last pale in comparison. Yesterday (the 25th), the reporter inquired of a certain employee of Broadway Mansion, who claimed that he was unaware of the existence of a casino on the 18th floor of the building, only admitting that a certain "General Association" had entrusted a famous lawyer here to rent several rooms. He was unwilling to disclose the name of the lawyer, nor did he know the name or activities of the General Association. According to news received by the Continental Daily several days ago, which was confirmed by reliable sources yesterday, the General Association officially opened last Friday. Its "activities" are not "secret." Furthermore, it is heard that the gambling in this money-burning den includes roulette, pai gow, and sic bo, etc. Those who frequent it are mostly people who live in Broadway Mansion, who have nothing to do after 1 AM, because at that time, traffic across the Suzhou Creek bridge to Hongkou is cut off, so they gamble to pass the time. It is heard that most of the gamblers are wealthy puppet Chinese. According to yesterday's news, among the operators of the General Association, there is one American and several wealthy White Russian Jews, one of whom is a jeweler.</p>
<p>Chinese Mobile Units Recover Zhangjiagang</p>
<p>It is learned that on the evening of the 24th, the Chinese guerrillas took advantage of the darkness to attack Zhangjiagang.

The Zhangjiagang flight now has the German merchant vessel Hengxi Lun scheduled to sail on the 27th for a return voyage.</p>
<h3>Charity Lottery: Continued Issuance</h3>
<p>Managed by Fengxing Company; Draw on September 4th</p>
<p>The French Chamber of Commerce's charity lottery for refugees has been suspended for a month. It is now learned that a Mr. Ma and others have raised funds to continue managing the lottery with the French head office. The contract was officially signed yesterday, and the company is named Fengxing Company. It is also heard that this decision was made because they obtained approval from a certain party to promote sales in various guerrilla areas, so the subscription amount is still 150,000 yuan. The twelfth issue will begin distribution within the next week and will be postponed to September 4th for the draw.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Line: Increase in Shipping Vessels</h3>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Board Vessels for Inspection; No Incidents Occurred</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line was interrupted after the Zhenhai estuary blockade, with the Taiping Lun deliberately sunk at the end of last month. This caused great inconvenience for Ningbo and Shaoxing natives in Shanghai. The German merchant Lihuo Yangxing's Moufu Lun applied to the authorities for permission to continue sailing. However, due to the blockage of the Zhenhai estuary waterway, it could not enter or exit, and had to anchor outside the blockade line to load and unload goods and transport passengers, using barges instead. This caused delays in anchoring outside the Zhenhai estuary, making it inconvenient for passengers to embark and disembark and for goods to be loaded and unloaded. However, the number of passengers remains extremely crowded, and tickets are difficult to purchase due to restrictions. Recently, the authorities have relaxed the restrictions slightly, so the number of passengers traveling back and forth has increased several times.</p>
<p>Hanabao Quickly Sails to Ningbo</p>
<p>The Sino-Italian Company's Deping Lun and the Moufu Lun have resumed sailing one after another. The German Far East Company's Hanabao Lun, which originally sailed on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Dinghai lines, had both routes banned early on. Now, it has also applied for permission to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and departed for Ningbo on Saturday morning of the previous week at the same time as the Deping. According to the company, the Hanabao Lun is expected to return to Shanghai from the Zhenhai estuary this morning and may be able to enter the port tonight. It is now learned that the Italian merchant Yihua Yangxing's Baoli Lun, which also sailed on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Dinghai lines, has been docked in Shanghai for a long time since the ban. It has now been granted permission by the authorities to join the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It is now scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Zhenhai on the morning of the 28th (Friday) at the same time as the Moufu Lun. The Baoli Lun passenger ticket sales office is located at 309 Beijing Road, and cargo loading should be arranged at 163 Guangdong Road.</p>
<p>Two Vessels Suddenly Inspected</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry from the shipping industry, at 4 PM on the 24th, a Japanese warship suddenly sent soldiers to board the Sino-Italian Deping Lun and the Far East Hanabao Lun, which were anchored at Qiliyu outside the Haikou, for inspection. The inspection lasted for twenty minutes before they withdrew.</p>
<p>Shenfu Attempts Sailing to Shacheng</p>
<p>The British merchant Yilong Yangxing has recently obtained the Japanese side's consent to resume the Shanghai-Wenzhou route and plans to send the Shenfu Lun directly to Shacheng tomorrow. It is not yet certain whether the voyage will be obstructed by Japanese warships, so it must wait until the return of this test voyage to Shanghai before it can be clear whether passage is possible. Therefore, the official sailing schedule will be determined after the test voyage.</p>
<p>Lude Opens Shanghai-Dinghai Line</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Dinghai shipping line has been restored by Japanese vessels, with the Hainan Daye and other vessels sailing one after another. It is now learned that the German merchant Delin Yangxing has dispatched the Lude Lun, scheduled to join the Shanghai-Dinghai-Daishan line on August 1st. However, there is almost no passenger or cargo transportation between Shanghai and Dinghai.</p>

<h3>Putuo Falls</h3>
<p>Chinese Forces Retreat to the Hills; Japanese Warships Still Anchored Offshore</p>
<p>At dawn the other day, two Japanese warships suddenly sailed to the waters off the Western Boat (Xi Fang Chuan) in front of Putuo Island, one of the famous scenic spots, and anchored. Subsequently, four speedboats were lowered, carrying more than two hundred Japanese soldiers, who swarmed ashore at Duangu Daitou. They first strafed the mountains and forests with machine guns before slowly searching the entire island. They also shot and killed a farmer near the Fanyin Cave on the back mountain. The local self-defense forces, due to their isolated and outnumbered position, avoided unnecessary sacrifices and retreated to the hills, waiting for an opportunity to attack. After searching the entire mountain in groups, the Japanese soldiers stationed themselves at the Qian Shan Puji Temple (also known as the Former Temple) and Baoben Hall that evening. Except for a portion who returned to the warships the next morning, more than seventy soldiers are still stationed there. A double-funneled Japanese cruiser and a transport ship are still anchored in the waters off the mountain.</p>
<h3>Huzhou Maru Small Vessel Bombed and Sunk</h3>
<p>Intercepted by Chinese Regular Army Near Xindai</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Pinghu Shipping Company in this port has two vessels, the Huzhou Maru No. 1 and No. 2, which operate between Shanghai and Pinghu, calling at small wharves such as Wangjiadu, Dujiahang, Tangkou, Minhang, Mishidu, Chuanlai Miao, and Zhujing. There is one round trip per day. The Shanghai wharf is located at</p>
<p>the Sichuan Road Bridge. On the 23rd of this month, the Huzhou No. 1 was loaded with goods and returned to Shanghai. On the evening of the same day, when passing near Xindai, it suddenly encountered the 45th Brigade of the Chinese Regular Army's mobile unit, which was marching through. They ordered the vessel to stop and searched it, finding</p>
<p>certain items related to military affairs. They summoned the six crew members, poured kerosene on the Huzhou Maru No. 1, and threw hand grenades, causing an explosion and fire, and it sank in an instant. One of the six arrested persons was released yesterday, but the whereabouts of the other five employees are still unknown. After receiving a report from the released crew member, the Pinghu Company not only ordered the Huzhou Maru No. 2 to stop direct voyages to Pinghu, temporarily stopping at Zhujing, but also tried to rescue the detained five persons by contacting the Chinese military authorities in that area.</p>
<h3>Detained Public Works Department Employees Have Been Released</h3>
<p>Detained for Two Days; Treatment Extremely Poor</p>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Bao, the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Englishman Ross, German Bayerle, Russian Klohi, and more than one hundred Chinese workers, who were detained by the "Great Way Municipal Government" for two days, were released and returned to Shanghai this afternoon (the 26th). According to Ross, who spoke to reporters at 1 PM, the food was sufficient, and the Public Works Department sent beer and other items, as well as beds. However, the bedding was dirty. He spent the first night sitting and waiting for dawn, and last night he used rice bags as pillows, while the Chinese workers slept on the stone ground. After Ross and others were released, they first went to the Dixiwei Road Police Station and then returned quickly. It is reported that they were carrying garbage to Zhabei at the request of the Japanese Marines on Monday afternoon to fill low-lying areas, and were detained by personnel from the "Great Way," whose "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan attempted to demand fees from the Shanghai Municipal Council for dumping garbage on both sides of the downstream of the Huangpu River for the past two years, at 10,000 yuan per month, hence the illegal detention of Ross and others.</p>

<h3>Robbery of Female Fortune Teller Case: Involves Another Robbery Case; Former Dance Hall Girl Had a Gold Ring Robbed; Three Defendants in Both Cases Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>The female fortune teller Jiang Tianzhen, who had a sign hanging on the fifth floor of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, once worked as a dance hall girl. She was short and lively. On the night of the 8th of last month, she was suddenly summoned to room 316 of the Far East Hotel, and under the pretext of fortune telling, a diamond ring worth more than 700 yuan, a gold watch, and cash were robbed. She reported to the police station. Hua Detective Ding Huaguo and Detective Yin Zhanqing of the Xinzha Police Station arrested the suspects Sun Wenzhong, Yao Guisheng, Xu Gengsheng, and Cui Yucheng, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. During a subsequent investigation, the police station found a diamond ring (pledged for 460 yuan) at the Hongxingxiang Jewelry Store at 527 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. It was also found that the defendant Sun Wenzhong, together with Xu Azhang and Ma Pi Jinbao, who are still at large, hid a handgun and went to the Xuangong Dance Hall on Edward Road on the night of June 4th of this year. Sun Wenzhong acted as a dance partner and, seeing that the dance hall girl Pan Huizhen (who lived at 28 Sande Lane, Longmen Road) was wearing a gold ring, danced with her and spent 10 yuan to buy a dance ticket. He took Pan to the Metropolitan Dance Hall, danced for a short while, and then went to the Lido Dance Hall. However, when they arrived near Aivenyi Road and Dahua Road, it was already late at night, and the place was desolate, and the road was dark. Sun and the other two showed their handguns, threatening and robbing Pan of two gold rings worth 90 yuan each that she was wearing on her hand. At the time, Pan did not report this matter to the police station. It was not until Sun Wenzhong was arrested that he confessed everything. Detective Ding and others went to investigate and found that it was true. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui sat on the bench of the Third Criminal Court to continue the trial. The three defendants each hired lawyers to defend them in court. The police station lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the above circumstances, saying that the diamond ring in the Jiang Tianzhen robbery case has now been recovered, but the watch has not been found, and the two gold rings of Pan Huizhen in the other case have not been found either. Jiang Tianzhen and Pan Huizhen then complained about the robbery. Judge Liu inquired of each defendant one by one and clarified the facts. He sentenced Sun Wenzhong for continuous gang robbery to six years of imprisonment, Yao Guisheng and Xu Gengsheng were fined 50 yuan each for receiving stolen goods, and Cui Yucheng was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Impersonating an Official for Extortion: Translator Sentenced</h3>
<p>Yao Tingxin (also known as Yao Tingsen), a 29-year-old Shanghai native who worked as a translator for the Public Concession Police Station and lived at 1274 Jing'an Temple Road, colluded with Yue Qiuxin, a 20-year-old youth from Guangdong, and was instigated by Xu Hao (29), a Jiaxing native and teacher at Hengmao Primary School in Hengmao Lane, Ba Xian Qiao. He led a Russian to impersonate an official from the French Municipal Council's Zhao Hui Jian, extorting 1,000 gold from the headmaster of Hengmao Primary School, Yang Guoping (a native of Shaoxing, because he built four-story shelving in the school without a license).

<h3>China Athletic Referee Association Reiterates Rectification of Sports Ethics</h3>
<p>The secretariat of the Shanghai China Athletic Referee Association issued the following notice to the sports community regarding the resolution of the meeting of all members of the association on "Rectifying Sports Ethics":</p>
<p>The Referee Association has been established for more than ten years, with more than one hundred members, and its footprints are all over the provinces and cities of the country. Its unwavering common belief is to maintain the dignity of referees and to rectify sports discipline. In order to maintain this consistent policy, the association has gone through all kinds of difficulties and tasted all kinds of pain for more than ten years, and it still moves forward bravely without any complaints. Whenever we encounter an unfortunate incident, we never forget public justice because of private friendship, nor are we willing to be accommodating and seek perfection. If justice is not promoted and discipline is not rectified, we are willing to endure any sacrifice. This spirit of great impartiality and fearlessness has long been deeply imprinted in the minds of all members, and it does not start today. However, those who do not understand the true meaning of sports generally retorted with this and thought that they did not know the current affairs and criticized them. They did not know where the Tao was, and they would not look back. If public justice was not promoted, they would not hesitate to go through fire and water. What is the value of advocating sports, and what is the value of advocating this sports that runs counter to it? The hearts of the people are not as old as they used to be, and it does not start today. However, the past can be learned from, and one can be punished by one. Why are things that are not divided between public and private, and things that are not clear about right and wrong, still lingering and unwilling to go away, and they are becoming more and more serious, covering up their mistakes, and stealing bells, and there are many things that are not enough. If it is not until the network is completely gone and there is no public justice, will it be happy? This is not only a tragedy for the future of sports, but also a sigh for the world and the human heart. Secretariat of the Shanghai China Athletic Referee Association, July 26, 28th year of the Republic.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance Although Out-of-Town Banknotes are Said to be Accepted, They Are Still Not Fully Circulating in the Market Agricultural Bank of China Place-Named Notes are Universally Accepted</h3>
<p>This newspaper has previously reported on the difficulties faced by those holding banknotes with place names from other locations. Yesterday, various news outlets reported that the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the National Industrial Bank will continue to accept banknotes with place names from other commercial banks. However, according to investigations, most stores are still unwilling to accept them. When asked why, they replied, "If we deposit them in the bank, the bank won't accept them, so we have no choice but to refuse them." They also stated, "Newspaper reports have recently been full of deception and cannot be fully trusted." This is truly concerning because currently, all types of businesses, even those involved in speculation and manipulation, are acting on their own. For example, rice merchants are monopolizing and hoarding rice, while still claiming to maintain the food supply for the people. Similarly, after the refusal to accept banknotes with place names from North China and Hankou, they can be remitted to those locations free of charge. However, they do not consider that the holders of these banknotes are mostly residents of Shanghai. How many of them need to remit money to Tianjin, Shandong, Jinan, Qingdao, and Hankou? The majority of people holding North China and Hankou banknotes cannot exchange them and have no way to remit them. Therefore, general speculators will buy these banknotes at a greatly reduced price to profit from them. It is now heard that North China banknotes have a market rate at a certain bank, with 1,400 yuan exchangeable for 1,000 yuan in legal tender. Hankou banknotes are exchangeable at 1,200 yuan for 1,000 yuan in legal tender. In essence, North China banknotes are discounted by 40% of their face value, and Hankou banknotes are discounted by 20%. Therefore, for the sake of their business prospects, to stabilize public confidence, and to attract deposits, banks should have a proper and clear statement regarding banknotes with place names from other locations. They should no longer rely on news policies. Whether or not these banknotes are accepted should be formally announced in newspapers by the banks or the banking association, so that the public knows what to do.</p>
<p>Since the banknotes with place names from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou stopped circulating, citizens and shops have also been mostly refusing to accept the place-named notes of the Agricultural Bank of China. Upon inquiring with the bank, it was said that all notes with place names such as Hangzhou, Hankou, Xi'an, Fuzhou, and Lanzhou, as well as the Hubei Provincial Bank changed to the Agricultural Bank of China, have long been considered to have no place names and are therefore universally accepted as always. They can be brought to the bank at Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet for unlimited exchange at any time. Local banks and money shops also accept them uniformly. However, some shops in the market accept them, while others still refuse them. When asked, it was also because some banks do not accept them. It is said that the ten-yuan and five-yuan renamed notes of the Hubei Provincial Bank have the words "Payable in national currency 〇 yuan at the Hankou head office," so shops that fear the hassle are mostly unwilling to accept them. Even one-yuan notes are not accepted. A certain gentleman had a one-yuan Agricultural Bank of China note with the place name "Lanzhou" and could not spend it, showing how deep the public's concerns are.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Swap Transactions Quite Active Rumors that the Stabilization Fund Will Not Support the Black Market British and American Exchange Contraction Not Yet Too Significant</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing remained unchanged. In the British and American exchange black market, due to the sudden contraction of inter-exchange rates between Britain and America, the morning opening was British stable and American soft. After the opening, due to the busy settlement of accounts by foreign firms, the willingness of British banks and HSBC to supply was extremely weak, while the demand was very good. In addition, speculators continued to short, and there were rumors in the market that the Stabilization Fund Committee would no longer maintain the foreign exchange of the occupied areas, letting it fluctuate naturally, and that HSBC had stopped supplying, etc., which led to a rather tight potential. It is estimated that the British gold once fell to 4 pence 35, and the American exchange rate once softened to 8.25 yuan. Later, because foreign banks' willingness to sell increased, the market was rather loose. At noon, British gold recovered to 4 pence 375, and the American exchange rate also recovered to 8.5 yuan. Extending to the noon closing, the situation was slightly soft again, with British gold closing at 4 pence 134375 and the American exchange rate at 8.4375 yuan. As a result, British was tight by 15625, and American was soft by 375. There were many swaps in the middle, because the current month's settlement is imminent, and many parties are bound by the tightening of silver and high discounts. If they are not settled, they have to be swapped. Therefore, the swaps in July and August are becoming increasingly widened, with the distance between July and August British gold being half a penny, and the American exchange rate differing by one yuan, with the combined monthly interest (excluding commissions) being about 12 cents. It is heard that Lever Brothers and a certain American bank, etc., because of the huge amount of legal tender use, are mostly offering discounts, and the half-day transaction is still active. The Hong Kong exchange rate market is rather soft, and the selling price has broken into the 31 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Swap Arbitrage 12 Cents</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London spot exchange contracted by 1875, the forward exchange dropped by 125, the New York silver price was stagnant, the London raw gold recovered by half a penny, the exchange rate of British against the US dollar fell by 7 cents, against Shanghai was slightly 0625, against France was still flat, the US dollar against the British pound contracted by 065, against Shanghai was unchanged, against France dropped by 0625, the central listing of various exchange rates remained the same as before, and the bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4 pence and a half for British gold and 8.75 yuan for the US dollar, compared to the previous closing, British flat and American tight was 0625, which was the reason for the same contraction of the exchange rate between Britain and the United States. After the opening, although foreign firms were short, in addition to HSBC, there were still suppliers, and the Hong Kong telegraph and Jardine Matheson also slightly came to sell, so there was a lack of change. It is estimated that foreign firms first settled in Jardine Matheson spot British gold at 4 pence and a half, and shorted a certain bank's spot US dollar at 8.75 yuan. At that time, the Hong Kong telegraph and Jardine Matheson sold HSBC spot British gold at 4 pence. Then, the British Bank's Lever Brothers absorbed foreign merchants' August British gold at 4 pence. When HSBC's listing was announced, it remained unchanged. And the silver equilibrium tax announcement remained exempt. After that, although foreign telegrams were congested, foreign banks ate well, and speculators also shorts, so the market was gradually soft. It is estimated that foreign firms such as Lever Brothers and speculators absorbed foreign telegrams and a certain bank's spot US dollars from 8.5 yuan, contracting to 375. Later, British gold called more than 4 pence and 25 at the softest, and the US dollar called more than 8.25 yuan at the tightest. Afterwards, the shorting wind slightly subsided, and foreign firms such as the Eastern Bank's willingness to sell increased, so the price gradually recovered. It is estimated that the Eastern Bank's current gold offered its counterparts spot British gold at 4 pence and 34375, and then foreign banks did spot US dollars at 8.375 yuan. At that time, foreign banks needed a large amount of legal tender, so they were willing to offer swaps, so the interest rate became larger, with the monthly interest rate being 11.5 cents and 12 cents, all paid by Japan's Bank and Jardine Matheson and Chinese merchants. Near noon, a certain bank offered spot gold to speculators at 4 pence and 375 and spot US dollars at 8.5 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the Hong Kong exchange rate bank's spot selling price had softened to 30.0625 yuan. Extending to the bank's spot selling price at noon, British gold was 4 pence and 34375, and the US dollar was 8.4375 yuan. As a result, compared to the late closing of the previous day, British tightened by 15625, American softened by 375, and Hong Kong exchange rate also contracted by 625. There is no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Telegraph Exchange Rate Up 15 Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 26th - Today the exchange market was calm. The British, American, and Japanese telegraph exchange rates were unchanged compared to yesterday's closing.

The afternoon closing telegraph exchange rate fell back by 3 yuan, to 330 yuan, up 15 yuan from yesterday's closing.</p>

<h3>Many Changes Gold Price Soars High Price at 3,850 Yuan More Than 1,500 Taels Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market conditions continued to rise sharply, and the pouring wind was very strong. As a result, it soared another 125 yuan, but the ups and downs in the middle were still huge, making it difficult to grasp. This situation is entirely due to the manipulation of general speculators. The overall potential throughout the day generally first rose sharply, then plummeted, and then rose again. The initial opening inherited the remaining wind of the previous day. In addition, the foreign exchange reported tight, and the public's confidence was strengthened. General non-industry buyers also came one after another. As for those holding goods, the concept of rising prices was extremely strong. Although there was profit to be made, they were still unwilling to sell to seek huge profits, so the market soared straight up. Around 10 o'clock, it reached a peak of 3,850 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange recovered, the idea of floating more out of the cage arose spontaneously. At that time, cash shops and silver shops also sold more actively. In addition, buyers did not dare to add more when prices fell back, so they turned sharply downwards. At one point, it fell to a low of 3,718 yuan. At noon, it was heard that the foreign exchange had slightly tightened again, and the buying wind was re-ignited. The noon closing had recovered to 3,760 yuan. In the afternoon, the industry continued to search harder, and securities firms also continued to advance fiercely, rising again to the 3,800 yuan mark. The evening closing was 3,795 yuan. Trading was still active, with a total of more than 1,500 taels throughout the day. Silver shop jewelry also changed a lot. As a result, the listed price was 15 yuan higher, the customs gold was still flat, and the Sino-British pure gold and other items rose again.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Up 125 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the early morning, the buying interest for each bar (ten taels) was quite strong. At 9:35, the market opened 30 yuan higher. Securities firms entered silver shop firms 50 taels, price 3,700 yuan. After the opening, the buying interest became stronger, and securities firms and money exchange firms competed to advance fiercely without stopping. In addition, the foreign exchange tightened, causing sellers to increase their prices even more. In an instant, it soared 70 yuan. Securities firms entered money exchange firms 50 taels, price 3,770 yuan. Just after a slight recovery, silver shop firms sold to gold shops 20 taels, price 3,750 yuan. After that, it was heard that the foreign exchange tightened even more, so the wealthy entrusted money exchange firms and others to purchase on their behalf. The intensity of the rise was like a galloping horse, soaring another 100 yuan. Gold shops entered silver shop firms 50 taels, price 3,850 yuan, the highest point of the day. But after 10 o'clock, there was a sudden reaction and a sharp decline, because the foreign exchange stopped tightening and trended easier, and sellers suddenly became active. In addition, the rise was too sharp, and buyers were cautious when prices fell back, so the decline was also strong. Before long, it plummeted 132 yuan. Money exchange firms sold to gold shops 50 taels, price 3,718 yuan. Near noon, it was heard that the foreign exchange was slightly softer, and money exchange firms came to absorb again, so it recovered 42 yuan. Money exchange firms traded 20 taels with each other, 3,760 yuan was the noon closing price. The market was strong in the afternoon. The opening was 10 yuan higher. Gold shops entered money exchange firms 50 taels, price 3,770 yuan. After that, the wealthy again entrusted securities firms and money exchange firms to absorb forcefully, and the price rose again by 30 yuan. Money exchange firms traded 50 taels with each other, price 3,800 yuan. At 3:15, money exchange firms traded another 40 taels with each other, price 3,795 yuan was the evening closing price. As a result, it soared another 125 yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that after the closing, the buyers were able to take in 3,800 yuan. The price fluctuated by 150 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand of gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold. The current marked gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Listed Price Up 15 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the selling price of silver shop jewelry was still 370 yuan per tael at Datong Hang. By 9:45, it listed 5 yuan higher, and five minutes later it was 10 yuan higher. At 10 o'clock, it was another 5 yuan higher. Later, at 10:10, it fell back 5 yuan, and at 10:30 it fell back another 5 yuan. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, it rose again by 5 yuan. As a result, it was listed 15 yuan higher. It is estimated that Datong Hang changed its listing to 385 yuan, and Xintong Hang was 383 yuan. The purchase price was not fixed.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Pound 95 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency, because the foreign exchange trended softer, spot gold rose sharply, and the government said it would not maintain the black market foreign exchange, the public's confidence was weak, and the market conditions were very strong. In the afternoon, spot gold rose more sharply. General economically affluent people competed to purchase British and American gold pounds, British and American gold notes, and ultimately regretted that they could not purchase them smoothly due to the scarcity in the market. The demand for Japanese gold notes was very strong, and the market conditions were firm. The evening market was 1.16 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was scarce, and they also tended to be expensive. The evening market was 9 jiao 5 fen. The association's transactions were quite active. Zhenxing sold Xiangtai 200 yuan in American gold notes, Baoxiang sold Qintai 100 yuan in American gold notes, and sold Longchang 400 yuan in American gold notes, and sold Fuhexing 3,000 francs in notes. Xiangkang sold Sentai 30 British gold pounds in notes, and Xiangtai sold Fuhexing 2,000 francs in notes. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds up 1.1 yuan, British gold notes up 1 yuan and 8 jiao, American gold pounds up 3 yuan, American gold notes up 5 jiao 8 fen, Hong Kong notes up 1 jiao 2 fen, French franc notes up 1 fen 5 li, Singapore, Dutch, Annam, and Philippine notes all up 1 jiao, Canadian notes up 4 jiao, and other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Recovers 10 Yuan Call Loan Rate Again at 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange draft bills saw a shift during the day, fluctuating between 230 yuan per thousand yuan throughout the day, recovering 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association call loan rate suddenly rose by 4 fen, and both the morning and afternoon markets were listed at 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Consistently Contract</h3>
<p>London, 25th - In the silver market, Indian and American merchants bought and sold. When the price was low, some people shorted. The situation was flat and tired, and the market was flat and stagnant after the closing. India offered to sell at the listed price. The spot exchange contracted by 1875, and the forward exchange dropped by 125. New York silver prices remained stagnant. Also, Mumbai silver reported that Indian silver conditions were tired. Spot and August both fell 9 anna, and September also fell small 10 anna. A total of 100 transactions were completed.</p>
<h3>On the Future of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, China's financial measures, such as limiting withdrawals, controlling domestic and foreign exchange, and export trade, and implementing deflationary policies in the Seven Seas, have all been to maintain the stability of foreign exchange and lay the foundation for finance. After the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, tax revenue suffered greatly. Following this, the North China Reserve Bank was established, issuing banknotes and collecting foreign exchange. At that time, although Chinese foreign exchange was controlled to resist, it was still being vigorously maintained, but it was not considered that the war could not be ended in a short time. According to the domestic economic situation, it was felt that the exchange rate was far above the natural level, and there was no need to maintain it forcibly. If at that time, it had been resolutely decided to sharply reduce the exchange rate to between six and seven pence, or to obtain a solid connection and strictly control foreign exchange, if either of these two could have been achieved, it would not only have made it difficult to collect foreign exchange, but also prevented capital from escaping. Unfortunately, the authorities did not have the courage of General Joffre to retreat to the final defensive line, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>This year, the Sino-British Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund was established, and in fact the price of legal tender was determined to be 8 pence 25. At that time, the financial situation in Shanghai gradually stabilized. However, due to the oversupply of currency, the financial industry lent recklessly, which led to the rampant speculation and hoarding. The increase in imports of foreign goods was drastic, and the overdraft of Shanghai people was unprecedented. As a result, the need for foreign exchange increased sharply, and the fund was spent greatly. Today, foreign exchange has been tightened again and withdrawals have been restricted again. Under this situation, imports of goods will inevitably decrease sharply, goods will actually be sold, stagnation will stop, hoarding will stop, and the need for foreign exchange will be greatly reduced. In addition, deflation is far more than the eve of August 13, and capital has reached the limit of no escape. International payments may naturally gradually move towards balance, and there is no reason for foreign exchange to shrink again.</p>
<p>Looking at the supply and demand of the foreign exchange market in recent months, speculators have purchased a large number of forward foreign exchange. Due to the impact of the deflation of legal tender and the lack of it, speculators will sell the forward foreign exchange that is due at that time, which is the reason for the recent slight recovery of foreign exchange. Therefore, from the above objective facts, regardless of whether the Equalization Fund will maintain foreign exchange, only considering the relationship between international animal husbandry and supply and demand, it is hoped that the foreign exchange value of legal tender will not fall again recently. However, the key is to prevent foreign exchange from being wasted and to ensure the stability of legal tender. The only way to do this is to stop the supply of black market exchange, and on the one hand, to supply the normal needs of industry and commerce in accordance with the legal exchange rate. In this way, the government will show great faith to the people, and the people's belief in legal tender will deepen, and the escape of capital will be cut off without persuasion.</p>
<h3>Grain Evil Merchants Act Lawlessly Disregarding the People's Food Supply Rice Merchants in Production and Sales Areas Increase Prices Simultaneously Black Market Price of Fresh Japonica Rice Reaches 23 Yuan</h3>
<p>National Rice The market situation is still chaotic and feels deserted. The newly arrived goods are priced high because after the interior heard of the soaring prices in Shanghai, the prices of brown rice also saw a sharp rise. Thick brown rice japonica even reached 18 yuan out of zero, which is in line with the Shanghai price, so it must be sold for 22-23 yuan. The producers and sellers of rice are acting together, and the owners are unwilling to sell them, and they do not show samples. At the same time, the goods in the hands of hoarders and visiting merchants, the goods that came out of customs earlier, must be fresh, and there are many who bought them at low prices. However, because of the price limit, the old goods have all been limited, and they have not shown samples. The goods owned by brokers must be sold in stores, and they have all been sold out in the past three days, resulting in no goods on the market. Because the general stores are panicked and buy goods, the stores are unusually crowded (the public should not fall into the trap of evil merchants), and they cannot find any supply. Therefore, it is rumored that there are those who directly purchase from the owners outside the market and make private black market deals, with fresh thick japonica rice reaching 23.5 yuan. All parties are familiar with this and do not see it. The evil merchants act without restraint. There were only purchases of broken tips and water-stained miscellaneous tips on the market yesterday. The number was only more than 3,700 bags, and the price opened high: broken tips 16 yuan, medium broken tips 15.7 yuan, miscellaneous tips 15.5 yuan to 15.85 yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice was traded at 325 bags, price 22 yuan. As for the sources of the various roads, there are no river boats, and only 1,200-1,300 bags of early and late rice from the south port were transported by car.</p>
<p>Guest Indica The high-quality goods have already exceeded the price limit by more than two yuan. Because the price limit is strictly enforced, brokers and hoarders dare not show samples for sale. Therefore, there are only broken brown rice and Jue indica rice on the market. However, the local merchants are very greedy and welcome broken brown rice, so the number of transactions is still 1,600-1,700 bags. The market price is also 3-4 jiao higher depending on the quality of the goods.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice The price of fixed orders is getting higher and higher, but there are still no buyers for the new Saigon rice at 26 yuan, so the official selling price in yesterday's market only increased by half a yuan compared to the previous day, to 25.5 yuan. 1,300-1,400 bags were opened.</p>
<h3>Customer Sales Continue The Flour Market Remains Stable</h3>
<p>The flour market continues to be active with customer sales. It is found that after the Nanyang merchants started their activities at the beginning of the week, 28,200 bags have been shipped from Xiamen. Yesterday, another 2-30,000 bags were added. After the Northern merchants tried to sell them, their appetite was also linked. The street's retail transactions also increased as usual. The reason is that the prices of goods are rising sharply, and the demanders are more interested in buying and selling. A total of 50,000 bags of various brands of flour were traded in the market, and Nanyang merchants accounted for half of them. The rest were bought by local and Northern merchants in this street. The price of No. 2 flour factory continued to stand at 4.85 yuan in cash. Because the factories do not produce much, they still restrict the supply to external hoarders.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is endless. Because of the high cost, the sellers mostly put them on the shelves to wait for sale. However, the appetite of the flour factories has been sluggish in recent days. Although there are hoarders who inquire, they are not official sales. Therefore, the market has been hit invisibly. Yesterday, the market opened at 6.9 yuan for Suzhou high wheat, 6.75 yuan for Danyang wheat, and 6.6 yuan for Anting wheat. 1,300 bags were traded, and they were still bought by hoarders on this street.</p>
<h3>Securities Domestic Bonds Stable Foreign Bonds Unchanged</h3>
<p>The securities black market was stable yesterday. The number of people attending the meetings has gradually become sparse. Generally, big investors are no longer interested in public bonds, because their elasticity is far less than that of foreign exchange and gold, and one is legal tender delivery and the other is exchange in and out. Therefore, speculators and big investors have abandoned this and turned to that. The news of the Anglo-Japanese conference is ambiguous. The British Foreign Office's reply to Ambassador Guo is full of empty promises, but it has not yet arrived. In short, the crux of the problem lies in the legal tender, so it is difficult for the market of public bonds to improve. However, there will be no more major storms. Because of the interest rate, there is more attention paid to them. There will be major changes after the interest is paid. The trend yesterday was first tight and then soft, and there were also rises and falls of 7-8 jiao. The number of transactions has decreased. Dingkang, Shuikang, Songmao, and Datong all sold out. Lianyi, Lianhe, Dafeng, and No. 22 all sold out. The table is still dominated by sporadic retail transactions. The market price was slightly better by 2-5 jiao. Compared with the covert price of the previous day, it was slightly tired by several jiao. The total number of transactions is estimated to be 4-500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing compared to the previous day</p>
<p>Unified A 52.60 51.00 52.00 Up 0.40</p>
<p>Unified B 43.50 43.20 45.50 Up 0.20</p>
<p>Unified C circle 42.90 42.10 42.45 Up 0.3</p>
<p>Unified D 41.60 ...... 41.60 Up 0.50</p>
<p>Unified E 42.0 41.80 41.95 Up 0.40</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of the Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 11.8 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to 14.4 yuan in exchange, which is up several jiao from the previous day. The listed prices of various British companies' stocks in London on the 25th of this month (Tuesday) rose slightly. The British registered shares of HSBC Bank rose by £1.5, with a price of £78. Curacao Trading Company rubber shares rose by 1.5 pence, with a price of 17 shillings, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>The London Chinese foreign debt, on the 25th of this month (Monday), the upper and lower tiers of various public bonds were flat and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: Yarn Industry Shifts Towards Foreign Exchange; Cotton Yarn Price Hikes Subside; Concurrent Sluggish Actual Sales; No Hope for Monetary Easing</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains in a state of precarious stability, but actual sales are unusually sluggish, and there is no hope for development from any quarter. This is primarily due to financial contraction, coupled with significant obstacles in various transportation routes. As for the Hong Kong route, patriotic sentiment is strong, and there is some procurement of both coarse and fine Chinese yarn. However, prices are soaring, deemed too expensive, and shipping costs and miscellaneous fees are high, making the delivered cost at the destination shockingly high. This lack of yarn sales is the biggest factor. Nevertheless, the general wealthy individuals in Shanghai are treating foreign exchange fluctuations as a ratio, and while they are still in high spirits regarding rising prices, the opening price for special Gold City factory 20-count yarn is a massive 625 yuan. However, the amount bundled is not large, and customers are adopting a buy-as-needed approach.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opened quietly in the morning due to weak actual demand. Dealers are optimistic and unwilling to relinquish their hoarded goods. Therefore, although actual sales are stagnant, there is no hope for prices to rebound. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse foreign yarn from the warehouse is 555 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price is 544 yuan. Trading was lackluster in the middle of the day, and customer sales remained sluggish. Suddenly, the shouting of brokers in the warehouse receipt market intensified. Upon investigation, it was found that a certain firm had previously opened an order with Shenxin No. 9 Factory for 150 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 480 yuan, a full head, and the factory had been urging payment. If the payment was not made, the account would be closed and settled in the market. The price suddenly dropped 7 yuan, reaching 537 yuan, with foreign yarn from the warehouse carrying a small premium of 4 yuan, at 550 yuan. By the close of trading, the market was calm. It was found that 755 bales were traded in half a day, with the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn falling 4 yuan, and warehouse receipts falling 7 yuan. Coarse yarn also fell 3-4 yuan, but Shepherd rose 1.5 yuan. Wing On Factory opened with 50 bales of special Gold City 20-count yarn at a price of 625 yuan. It was found that 650 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped from Tianjin yesterday, and 680 pieces were shipped to Tianjin today. The amount purchased by each trading house is listed on the left: Hong Kong 165, counterparts 580, mainland 10, total 755.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market has slightly improved, but actual transactions are lifeless. However, trading in next month's football is unusually enthusiastic, showing that people are expecting prices to rise. However, there is no hope for monetary easing. The current asking price for 20-count Moon Lute yarn is 430 yuan, and the price for next month is expected to be around 433 yuan.</p>
<p>The recent trend in the cotton yarn market has been slightly more stable, with less active speculation than in the past. Generally wealthy individuals are said to be quick-witted and highly skilled. It is said that their speculative strategy has changed, with half of their money being transferred to the Bund to hedge by purchasing foreign exchange, thus temporarily relaxing their focus on cotton yarn... payment two months later.</p>
<h3>Rongfeng Factory Imports 1,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton; Payment Two Months Later</h3>
<p>Cotton trading is quiet, but inter-dealer trading of Indian cotton continues unabated. Selling prices are very high. As for the factory, affected by the lack of hope for monetary easing, purchasing raw materials is proving particularly difficult. Various means are being sought to ensure an uninterrupted supply of raw cotton. Yesterday, Rongfeng Factory purchased over 1,000 pieces of Indian cotton, all with delivery and payment terms of two months. Sources from Northern Jiangsu indicate that due to the high and attractive selling prices in Shanghai, there are quite a few people taking the risk of procurement, and if they can be delivered to Shanghai, the resulting profits are indescribably high. 542 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived at the pier. The current cotton situation is listed on the left: New Special Flower 83.50, intraday trade 100 pieces, bank draft Peng Jia Pu 23.50 and another 100 pieces, bank transfer and Kang Di Xu 28.00, Rongfeng Factory imports 1,000 pieces (also sending to the factory for payment in February).</p>
<p>Another report states that foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become a dead market since the second major upheaval in the financial sector. It is only known that previously ordered goods are being settled with foreign firms, extracting profits to ease the financial strain. No new transactions have been reported, while the daily arrivals of goods are crowded. Various manufacturers are diligently devising methods to manage their finances to cope with this difficulty.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market was quite active yesterday. The market opened higher due to bullish telegrams from Bombay and Liverpool, simultaneously triggering enthusiastic purchases from new buyers and short covering. Later, the cotton market saw increased foreign buying due to the implementation of US cotton export subsidies, driving up spot prices in the South. Speculators and banks purchased at the close, resulting in a gain of 20 points over the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose one rupee.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Woolen Fabrics Guild Convenes to Discuss Business Strategies</h3>
<p>Since the sudden tightening of the exchange rate in this city on the 7th of last month, most woolen fabric firms have announced price increases of 15% to 20% based on samples. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this month, foreign exchange contracted sharply again. The Woolen Fabric Industry Guild decided to convene a meeting of its members at its headquarters on Henan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday (July 26th) to standardize future prices. A total of twelve companies attended, including Lianxing Zhaoji, Fushun, Shunxing, Meifa, Changji, Yichangtai, and Wangxingchang. Chaired by Wang Shanfu and Li Quanzhong, after two hours of discussion, decisions were made regarding future business strategies, credit terms, and discounts on fabric samples. In terms of credit, accounts that were previously settled quarterly will now be settled monthly (i.e., monthly clearance). Accounts settled monthly will now be sold for cash with a ten-day term (i.e., a ten-day draft can be issued). The above methods will be determined based on the customer's creditworthiness, and the remainder will be sold for cash. In terms of prices, regardless of whether the goods are new or old, prices will be based on five pence, so that new and old purchase prices can be offset. Furthermore, pricing for the same color will be standardized among members. If the exchange rate suddenly advances four pence, another meeting will be convened at that time to make a decision. As for sample discounts, there have been significant differences among firms in the past, with discounts ranging from 20% to 40% to 38%. These will also be standardized in the future. (Jun)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: State-Produced Sugar Purchased by Ningbo Merchants; Market Prices Reach New Highs Again</h3>
<p>State-Produced Sugar: Due to the premium on deferred payments in foreign exchange, market prices are trending higher daily. It is reported that Ningbo merchants are making purchases, making the market more active and reaching new highs again. Over 200 bags of superior white powder were traded yesterday, opening at 40.40 yuan to 41 yuan. Several dozen bags of High Yellow Gangqing opened at 24.5 yuan. Over 300 bags of cotton red opened at 29 yuan, later called at 30 yuan. Over a hundred bags of Huizhou white opened at 37 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Sugar: According to a telegram from London, August is 7 shillings and 1.5 pence, up half a penny. December is 6 shillings and 2.25 pence, up 0.25. March of next year is 6 shillings and 3.25 pence, up one penny.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Ammunition Bureau</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou authorities have now established a manufacturing plant dedicated to producing foreign gunpowder, bullets, copper casings, artillery shells, etc. Many artisans from the Shanghai Ordnance Bureau have gone to work there. The factory employs a total of 100 artisans, supervised by 10 supervisors. Work commences every morning at 9:00 AM and ceases at 4:00 PM, with Sundays off, following the pattern of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. However, there are no Westerners involved. It is noted that Hangzhou has traditionally had a Military Equipment Bureau and a Gunpowder Bureau. Now, it is dedicated to producing Western-style ammunition to benefit from firepower, demonstrating the great attention paid to the military by the senior officials in Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Recent Status of Overseas Young Students</h3>
<p>The Chinese envoy previously ordered to go to Cuba to inspect Chinese laborers is said to have passed through the United States on his way back, visiting the schools where overseas young students are studying. It is reported that "although the students' proficiency in Western languages varies, some have made great progress. Not only can they understand the language thoroughly, but they can also explain Western texts that are not too profound." It is also said that "the students reside in American homes, and the Americans all praise them, saying that they possess gentle and diligent qualities, and thus love them as their own children. The Chinese teachers sent from China are periodically recalled to the General Bureau for examination, and they take turns studying Chinese every half month." It is also heard that after studying Chinese in turn, the students return to their respective American homes with joy, indicating that the Americans treat them well, or perhaps the teachers in the General Bureau are more strict in their supervision.</p>
<h3>Goddess Hall</h3>
<p>Lu Erxi's daughter from Xishan has the reputation of being a prodigy. At the age of nine, her tutor gave her the line "The spring breeze is like a tiger" to complete. She immediately responded with "The autumn water is lighter than a gull." Using an idiom to match an idiom, it is truly wonderfully beyond compare. In the future, the title of "talented woman with painted eyebrows" should not be limited to the area below Jiulong Mountain.</p>

<h3>The Question of Residence: Countryside vs. City</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Each Has Its Advantages and Disadvantages</p>
<p>Speaking of the question of residence, whether in the countryside or in the city, people will certainly raise a question, which is whether a person's lifespan is longer when living in the countryside than when living in the city? The answer is that the lifespan of rural residents is longer because, according to statistics, the mortality rate in cities is higher than in the countryside. This is true not only in China but also in various European and American countries, where the population mortality rate in cities exceeds that in the countryside.</p>
<p>Living in the countryside indeed has many advantages, the most obvious being that the air is very fresh. Farmers work in the fields all day long, not only absorbing fresh air but also getting plenty of sunlight. Due to daily work, their bodies are quite strong, stronger than those of city dwellers. Due to the sparse population, infectious diseases do not spread as rapidly as in cities. As for city dwellers, they generally do not get fresh air or sunlight, and they have less labor time. Due to overcrowding, infectious diseases can spread very quickly, and their physique is much weaker than that of rural residents.</p>
<p>However, living in the countryside also has its disadvantages, and living in the city is not without its advantages. Although rural residents can absorb fresh air and sunlight when working outside, when they return to their homes, all the houses are not only small but also have few windows, dim light, damp ground, and are located very close to cattle sheds, pigsties, and manure pits, with swarms of mosquitoes and flies, which is appalling. These are all sources of disease. The drinking water is not as clean as in the city, and the nutritional value of food is not very sufficient due to economic poverty. If they contract an infectious disease, they cannot be sent to a well-equipped hospital. On the other hand, buildings in the city are more sophisticated than those in the countryside, with dry foundations, open windows, and fewer mosquitoes and flies than in the countryside. The drinking water is tap water that has been filtered by sand, which is cleaner than in the countryside, and the nutritional value of food is also more sufficient than in the countryside. If they get sick, they can be sent to the hospital quickly. In particular, city dwellers are more educated than rural residents, so they pay more attention to hygiene issues and have a richer knowledge of hygiene. These are the advantages of living in the city over living in the countryside.</p>
<p>Seventy or eighty years ago, the mortality rate in European and American cities was more than twice as high as in the countryside, but in recent years, the difference has narrowed. The only reason why the urban mortality rate has been able to decrease so rapidly is the progress of hygiene education. Taking Shanghai as an example, public and private institutions often lead the public in carrying out hygiene campaigns, using various methods to arouse residents' attention to hygiene. Vaccination and inoculation, and widespread publicity, have achieved significant results. The fact that Shanghai has avoided major epidemics in the past two years is the result of paying attention to hygiene. Therefore, if people living in cities pay attention to hygiene issues, whether personal or public, then their lifespan will not necessarily be shorter than that of people living in the countryside.</p>
<h3>Summer Coats</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>Following the high-end woolen suit stores' promotion of winter coats and spring coats, I am going to advocate for a kind of summer coat.</p>
<p>Many people must be criticizing me for being heat-struck! Coats are inherently for warmth, and in the winter when the north wind is harsh and in the spring when it is chilly, a coat is needed to maintain body temperature. But in this hot season, people try to make their clothes as thin, light, and cool as possible, so where is the need for a cumbersome coat?</p>
<p>This is certainly true, but in the plum rain season, when the heat fades in the late evening, and especially in this climate ravaged by hurricanes, do people wearing thin, bare-chested, and bare-armed new clothes not need an outer garment to regulate their body temperature?</p>
<p>Many ladies have already seen this point, so we often see many long and short coats made of silk or floral cloth on the road.</p>
<p>These coats are certainly very novel and beautiful in appearance, and the colors are also suitable for the clothes and the season, but they have several shortcomings. Because the cloth is not smooth and is sticky, stiff, and not breathable; and the silk is expensive in terms of raw materials and labor costs, and a piece costs more than a dozen gold pieces, which ordinary people cannot afford in this time of rising prices and economic hardship.</p>
<p>Now I am going to promote a kind of summer coat that is both affordable and beautiful.</p>
<p>The raw material for this coat is any color of cashmere wool, one and a quarter skeins (selling for less than one yuan). Prepare the finest bamboo skewers, two or four at a time, and use a single strand of wool to weave it in your favorite pattern. You can match the colors of the collar and cuffs and embroider various flowers; (but one thing to pay attention to is that the collar, cuffs, and hem must be woven with double strands, and the body and sleeves should be large rather than small to avoid damage easily)</p>
<p>A coat made in this way is as thin as a cicada's wing and as brilliant as rosy clouds. Wearing it, it is light, warm, and beautiful, all in one. In the sunset with the breeze blowing, it is truly like floating in the air. Why don't you beautiful women give it a try?</p>
<h3>June Vegetarianism</h3>
<p>— Long Jusheng</p>
<p>In the customs of our society, devout men and women who believe in Buddhas and Bodhisattvas generally start eating "June Vegetarianism" in the sixth month of the lunar calendar. On the eve of the first day of the sixth month, they eagerly "seal" their vegetarian diet, with chicken, shrimp, fish, meat, and other unclean items spread all over the table, eating to their heart's content! Disregarding the precept against killing in this way, they call it "sealing" their vegetarian diet, which is truly absurd. As for the traditionally practiced scramble to eat "June Vegetarianism," it is not entirely objectionable because eating vegetarian food during the hot summer has hygienic and health-promoting significance.</p>
<p>I remember that the custom of devout men and women eating "June Vegetarianism" was very prevalent in Wuxi because the vegetables there, nourished by the beauty of the mountains and waters, are fertile and lush, always better than those produced in neighboring areas. Vegetables like chicken feathers, edamame, Changgenglu, called Changmangdou in Shanghai, yellow soybean sprouts, green soybean sprouts, (although they are hatched from soybeans and mung beans, they are nourished by the spirit of blue waves and green waters, much more robust than those in Shanghai), winter bamboo shoots, eggplants, cucumbers, etc... are all rich in vitamins. And Wuxi's pig's blood fungus (produced at the foot of Mount Hui), oil gluten, small box tofu, and other vegetarian dishes are even more popular. Therefore, in my childhood, I often ate "June Vegetarianism" with my mother and was never attacked by the demons of abdominal pain or diarrhea in the summer. Unfortunately, the lakes and mountains have changed color today, and I think the June vegetarian dishes of the past are now also full of the stench of blood. As for me, trapped on a solitary island, my hometown dreams are broken, and I am even more saddened by this "June Vegetarianism."</p>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>These few days have entered the dog days of summer, which can be considered the most formal summer. As a result, the custom of eating vegetarian food in June is very popular for a while, not only do the ladies and grandmothers eat a lot, even the general men are eating quite a bit. This kind of vegetarian food can not be blamed on superstitious divine power, in fact, eating more vegetables in the hot weather is also a hygienic way, so it can also be called eating hygienic vegetarian food. What's more, in the era of expensive rice and cinnamon, eating less meat and more vegetables is also in line with the principles of economy. However, for the housewife, it is not easy to make vegetarian dishes, because if you just eat simple vegetables every day, you will get tired of it over time, and I am afraid that you will reduce your appetite, so sometimes you have to think of some tricks. Now I will introduce two vegetarian dishes that I love to eat; one: braised vegetarian bedspread; cut green vegetables, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, dried tofu, etc. into cubes, wrap them in tofu skin to form a bedspread shape, first fry them in hot oil until golden brown, and then braise them with mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fungus, and golden needles together. Two: sweet sauce fried eggplant, first cut the eggplant into pieces, put it in the pot to simmer until cooked, then add sweet sauce and stir-fry until crispy, the taste is very rich and beautiful.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Housing Trio</h3>
<p>— Zhi'an</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Humorous Dining</h3>
<p>— Lover of Apple Room</p>
<p>Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Mr. Feng Yuxiang, has many humorous gestures; in the past, he once gathered military officers for a picnic in the snowy weather, with only a few cold steamed buns and a little bit of vegetables, Feng looked around while eating, and was displeased when he saw people with a difficult expression. When Feng was in the Northwest, one day for breakfast, Feng sent steamed cornbread made of black flour to the officers and Feng's deputy director (i.e., General Feng Zhi'an) in the dining hall for them to eat, but all the cornbread given to them had been left for many days, and the taste was slightly sour, so everyone frowned and could hardly swallow it. Feng smiled and said to General Feng Zhi'an, "Deputy Officer Feng has the largest appetite, how many can you eat today?" At that time, General Feng Zhi'an had to eat as much as possible because Commander Feng was in front of him, so he smiled and said, "I can eat six!" Feng repeatedly inquired about it, a certain director said five, a certain officer said four, and there was a lot of laughter. Before long, the black flour cornbread had been divided and eaten.</p>
<p>Also, in the 17th year of the Republic of China, when Feng's army was stationed in Zhengzhou, on New Year's Day, Feng ordered the soldiers to replace firecrackers with the ping-pong sound of their mouths, and then summoned the military officers to give a speech, first saying, "Today is New Year's Day, everyone please sit down and listen." Finally, he said, "Although we have big fish and meat to eat today, we have prepared chicken eggs, and no matter what, everyone has to spread one, you have been working hard all day, and you have to be comfortable today, I will let your superiors serve you and give you nourishment, you don't have to move!" After a while, dinner was served, and the heads of each department were busy serving their subordinates, like waiters, and there were many people who secretly laughed.</p>
<p>Short Message: Mr. Jiang Zhongchuan of Wuxian County is the only collector of Chinese silver coins. Now, the Shanghai Universal Postal and Coin Company has asked him to make illustrations of the precious genuine gold, silver, and nickel coins he has collected over the past ten years, as well as the genuine collections of Chinese collectors. Each coin will be separately identified by Mr. Jiang, and described in Chinese and English. It is a necessary reference book for studying and collecting gold, silver, and nickel coins to identify authenticity. It has now been published, and each book is sold for 12 national currencies. The general distributor is the Universal Postal and Coin Company, 90 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, and the distributor is Biefa Bookstore. It is said that printed samples can be requested from the general distributor by mail.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>Seek and Ye Shall Find</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Why is there a "seek and ye shall find" reality? Originally, whenever a person seeks something, he must have a certain determination, followed by a certain action to achieve his goal. Suppose there is only an idea, a wish, without determined action, not even as good as the "waiting" and "expecting" of "waiting for a rabbit to strike a tree." Then this cannot be considered "seeking," and naturally, there will be no "finding."</p>
<p>People who understand "seek and ye shall find" can be said to be invincible: reasonable seeking can certainly be fulfilled, and even unreasonable seeking, such as stealing, robbing, threatening, and all the sinful pursuits in the world, can often be responded to as one desires. Seeking, seeking diligently, seeking with all kinds of means, is indeed the secret to all success!</p>
<p>The same is true for small things and big things. Some people in Western Europe have repeatedly demanded, and indeed, they have repeatedly returned fully loaded. Some people in East Asia have repeatedly kidnapped, and indeed, they have repeatedly boasted of "success" and achieved their goals. From then on, their appetite will naturally grow bigger and bigger, and they will seek more and more. There are certainly many good shows that seem unexpected but are actually intended to appear.</p>
<p>Is the power that comes from seeking really unstoppable, is there really no way to deal with this kind of seeking? Of course, there is no absolute thing in the world, and heaven never closes all roads for people. This kind of seeking has an end, and there is also a way to deal with it. However, the ground will not stop itself, it must be forced to stop by someone, that is, by using another method to deal with it.</p>
<p>This method of dealing with it has no secret, it is another kind of seeking. He seeks from you, and you also seek from him. He has determination and action, and you also have determination and action. He can succeed, and you can also succeed. The hope of mutual success, in pure theory, is fifty and fifty, mutually equal.</p>
<p>However, when the two sides fight hard, one side will always fail in the end. Why is this? Isn't seeking eventually something that cannot be obtained? I tell you: this is because of the righteousness or unrighteousness of seeking. When seeking nothing meets unrighteous seeking, seeking nothing can only fail. But when unrighteous seeking meets righteous seeking, unrighteous seeking can only fail. Only in these opportunities will seeking be unattainable. Justice will ultimately triumph over power.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that we must use seeking to deal with others' seeking, and we must especially use righteous seeking to deal with unrighteous seeking!</p>
<h3>Following in Each Other's Footsteps</h3>
<p>— Li Yishan</p>
<h3>The Book of Truth (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Mara</p>
<p>The night was very gentle, but very dark. The wind of the wilderness whistled through the distant forests, fields, and hills, bringing the fragrant scent of earth, flowers, and grass, swirling above our heads. The moonlight was so faint it was just like a layer of white mist. The scattered trees around cast shadows haphazardly, painting a dim and terrifying picture like ghosts. The small stream flowed exceptionally loudly in the silence, like a garrulous old woman telling endless secrets. In hidden places, one could still hear one or two cries of wild beasts, desolate and shrill.</p>
<p>My father and I sat facing each other. The light of his pipe flashed intermittently, revealing my father's melancholic and silent wrinkled face, as if he were pondering something. At this moment, a rustling sound arose in the woods, like cautious footsteps treading on withered and fallen leaves. I suddenly became afraid. I looked at my father, but he had not changed in the slightest, as if all his senses had stopped. I could no longer endure it, and I impatiently called out, "Father."</p>
<p>My words interrupted his thoughts. He was slightly surprised, but then he said alertly:</p>
<p>"Child, what is it? Are you afraid? How about I tell you a story?" My father looked at me with a smile, his words filled with gentleness and concern, and my fear instantly vanished.</p>
<p>"Good, good, tell a beautiful one, Father," I said excitedly.</p>
<p>"Beautiful?" My father shook his head heavily. "None of my stories are beautiful, but they are all true." His eyes swept across my face, waiting for my reply.</p>
<p>"That's fine too, Father, then tell it quickly," I was already impatient.</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, there was a country in the West, the Daoxian Kingdom, not much different from ours. It also had a large number of impoverished people. You cannot imagine the kind of life they lived. You have clothes to wear, you have enough to eat, you live a happy life, you would not know what their lives were like," my father began his story like this.</p>
<p>"So, among those impoverished people, a piece of information spread: it was said that two years ago, God placed a book written by himself on Mount Mosun. The book contained the truth about how God told humans they should live. The words 'The Book of Truth' were engraved on the cover, with a footnote: 'Those who read it will receive life and happiness.' They glowed with brilliant light at night, which people across the whole kingdom could see, which proved that the rumors were true. Therefore, they decided to read this book of truth." My father's tone revealed great distress, as if he was worried that a great disaster had befallen them. He took a deep puff of his pipe, and the blue smoke rose in a winding wisp, gradually disappearing into the heavy darkness.</p>
<p>"But the King found out about this, and his panic was naturally great, because it would hinder his 'divine right'. He immediately ordered his cavalry to surround the mountain, forbidding the people to read the Book of Truth, and at the same time, he established a censorship bureau, using cruel punishments to suppress the people. After many bloody massacres, they surprisingly became very quiet." My father's face was covered with dark clouds, and he sighed deeply. The sigh lingered in the air for a long time, and my heart was filled with the sound of the sigh.</p>
<p>"Did they really become quiet from then on?" I asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>"No, child, wishes are immortal, and anger is something that cannot be suppressed. It is like a volcano under the snow. They patiently wait, waiting for the day to repay blood with blood." My father replied excitedly, his eyes dreamily gazing at the distant, dark mountain range that outlined an arc in the dim sky, slowly continuing in a gentle tone: "This day finally came, was it the year when famine broke out everywhere? Hundreds of thousands of people gathered together, bravely rushed past the cavalry's sharp and beautiful swords, and surrounded the palace. Their magnificent cries for bread rang loudly in the King's ears, making the King tremble, without any way to stop them. After the people recognized their power, the King had no way to stop them, so in the end, that tyrannical monster was destroyed." My father seemed overwhelmed by joy, as if their fate was also his fate, his face covered with a pleasant smile. I couldn't help but call out to him happily.</p>
<p>"Good child, let me continue, the tragedy is in the back." My father's face suddenly turned gloomy again.</p>
<p>I listened more attentively:</p>
<h3>From Translation to Rewriting</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>I also read books written by foreigners that discuss Chinese issues theoretically; but I have never liked reading books written by foreigners that depict Chinese stories. Although it is said that some of them are well-written, I always think that foreigners do not have a deep understanding of Chinese customs and social conditions. They write based on hearsay or superficial observations, which inevitably feels like scratching an itch through a boot. In addition, I also think that Chinese stories are always better written by Chinese people than by foreigners. Of course, this is close to prejudice and not worth following.</p>
<p>I received a copy of Pearl S. Buck's "Patriot" translated by Brother Zhu Sha. I read a bit and didn't continue because I found its plot bizarre and its technique very ordinary. Later, I read the criticism in this magazine and learned about its general content. Soon after, Brother Zhu Wen came to visit, and we talked about this matter. Besides talking about Pearl S. Buck's insufficient understanding of Chinese affairs—especially that she made assumptions and exaggerations based on certain propaganda texts of news policies, resulting in many inconsistencies with reality, which objectively amounted to insulting China…etc., I also expressed the following opinion:</p>
<p>"If you use the effort of translating it to create your own work, I think the result will always be better than the translated version. The understanding will indeed be much more accurate, the materials will be more abundant, and the technique is not necessarily worse than hers.</p>
<p>"Even if you want to translate it, you shouldn't translate it directly. You might as well use it as a base to rewrite it: supplement and elaborate on the more exciting parts, delete and correct the parts with wrong viewpoints; at the same time, in terms of wording and structure, you can also rewrite it to be more Chinese style. As for the publication, just state these situations in front of the book."</p>
<p>"That's right. The Japanese are much smarter. The Japanese translation of this book deletes all the parts that are unfavorable to Japan." Brother Zhu Wen seemed to regret being too "faithful" when translating it.</p>
<p>In fact, the above opinion I stated can be said to be my view on the entire translation problem, not just on the book "Patriot". I always believe that the work of translation (as well as writing) is to serve the reader, not to serve the original author. It is really undesirable to translate things with distorted consciousness and absurd viewpoints without changing a word, which is "faithful" to the original author. Even for works with correct consciousness and appropriate viewpoints, "literal translation" according to the original text, making it unreadable and awkward, making people feel "headache" as if reading a "heavenly book", I don't think this is the best way to be "faithful" to the original author.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the basic condition is to translate the original text of foreign grammar into Chinese grammar, so that people can read it smoothly. Fortunately, after a "translation debate" before September 18th, "hard translations have been much less; but I still don’t seem to be satisfied. I believe that in addition to having complete translations of the first-class world masterpieces that grasp the era, it is also necessary to publish rewritten versions that can truly convey the spirit. May I ask, how many people with lower cultural levels can understand those complete translations of masterpieces? First of all, that series of long names of people and places is already dazzling to them; and those overly delicate descriptions also make their impressions slack and unable to comprehend; and there are many plots and tones that do not conform to Chinese customs and habits, making it difficult for them to understand accurately. In many places like these, I think it can be rewritten to be more Chinese, and shorter and more popular. Long works still have to be compressed, with a few "clean versions".</p>
<p>During the September 18th Incident, someone used the words "Das Kapital doesn't necessarily have to be understood by the masses" (this is the general idea, the original text is published in the Art News) to oppose my opinion of advocating "smooth" translation, I don't know what identity he was speaking from. Indeed, I don't advise everyone to go to revolution after they must understand Das Kapital, but if the masses can also understand a little meaning of Das Kapital, that is always a good thing, right? In Europe and America, there are publications such as "Student Das Kapital" and "Worker Das Kapital", and in China, there are also translations such as "Popular Das Kapital", which is nothing more than a popularization work to improve the cultural level of the masses.</p>
<p>In literature, such popularization work is also needed. In the Soviet Union, several masterpieces have also been published in compressed popular versions for children to read; in China, there are not many masterpieces that can truly grasp the era, then, borrowing foreign masterpieces to rewrite and publish a set of compressed popular versions for the masses to read is indeed very meaningful and urgently needed.</p>
<p>However, rewriting world masterpieces is not something that can be done casually. In addition to a selection effort, the plot, color, consciousness, and spirit of each masterpiece must be grasped, and resolved in the Chinese-style crucible, like extracting steel, to extract and retell its essence. Therefore, this is a very labor-intensive and thoughtful hard work, which requires collective discussion and cooperation from the literary and art circles, and even more the support of cultural institutions.</p>
<p>I hope that this rewriting (or re-translation) of world masterpieces will be implemented in a planned way in the near future.</p>

<h3>Joy (6)</h3>
<p>Joy of faith; extremely simple, extremely holy and clean, simple: is the reason for joy, pure must not be mixed. Some people say: I believe in Christ, my family is harmonious, husband and wife follow each other, so I am joyful; some people say: I believe in Christ, my business is prosperous, and I make millions of dollars, so I am joyful: some people say: I believe in Christ, my official career is smooth, and I am promoted out of order, so I am joyful... These reasons for joy are not pure, and may not come from faith. Although there is joy, I am afraid it is not reliable. Holy and clean: is the nature of joy, holy and pure, not to be joyful in worldly things, nor to mix worldly things; like the various things mentioned above, true Christians not only do not think of them as joy, but also as dung and filth. The prodigal son who wanders homeless, once returns to his father's lap; the hungry and weeping baby, once returns to his loving mother's arms, that kind of joy is close to the joy of Christians.</p>
<p>The joy of Christians comes from the only true God, and what is joyful is only the only true God. The true God is unchanging, so the joy is unchanging. There is joy in peace, and there is also joy in hardship and difficulty; there is joy in honor. There is also joy in poverty, humility, humiliation, persecution, ridicule, whipping, and imprisonment. It is not that joy is inhuman, but that it is beyond human affection. So-called human affection is the common emotion of mediocre people, shepherds, and woodcutters. Taking the common emotion of everyone as emotion is to be a human being; Christians are above the emotions of all people and have only divine emotion. Divine emotion: is what the world does not have, and the joy of divine emotion is also what the world does not have, and cannot be understood. To get this noble joy, only believe in Christ.

<h3>Me and "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears"</h3>
<p>— Lan Lan</p>
<p>I remember that it was still long ago, after the Carlton performance of "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears", the China Women's Mutual Aid Association specially convened a symposium. In addition to the actors of Flowers Sprinkled with Tears and the press, the majority of those present were dance hall sisters. At that time, the sisters in the dance world felt unusually excited about this first performance of a script with dance girls as the subject, which vented a sigh of relief for the dance girls. They couldn't help but recount many of their own tragic situations. In order to make the outside world understand their environment, in order to make the outside world know that they are not experts in living in a drunken dream, for they, like other women, have clear minds and clean souls. Under the sponsorship of the Mutual Aid Association, the dance world itself wanted to perform "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears". Their difficult and painful lives deeply moved me. Surrounded by this fiery atmosphere, after the request and encouragement of the venue, I mustered up my courage and, regardless of everything, took on the responsibility of directing this time. But recently, the public performance on the 27th—the same grand performance as participating in the drama festival—and bearing the mission of "charity" again, made me tremble at the heaviness of the burden.</p>
<p>In the process of rehearsal, what we felt was the greatest difficulty was the limited time of the actors. "What is the most appropriate rehearsal time?" Of course, no one can bear to deprive them of their only sleep in the morning. Besides meal dances, tea dances, and evening dances, the only thing left is the short two hours from two to four in the afternoon. But they still have to socialize and entertain. So these only two hours have become a problem. This of course affects the rehearsal work, and even for a very long period we simply had no way to continue our rehearsal. But in recent weeks, for those displaced, lonely and helpless refugees, they sacrificed sleep, overcame difficulties, and actively rehearsed. This enthusiastic spirit is really moving!</p>
<p>Five fifteen, this special performance time, was specially requested from the conference. Although the sacrifice of the tea dance is unavoidable, it can not affect the evening dance. The full performance of "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears" takes four hours. For the convenience of the audience, it was finally decided to follow the example of the Art Society's Sunday performance and only perform two acts. Please forgive the audience for this unavoidable difficulty.</p>
<p>I dare not predict the results of the performance. My own limited knowledge, coupled with my recent busy work of filming and rehearsing "Women's Apartment" and "Night Shanghai", is really a case of the spirit being willing but the flesh being weak. Because of the efforts of the actors, and the enthusiasm for the enthusiastic assistance and the support of the drama comrades, although it is said that this performance is for a greater purpose, I still very much hope that there will be some small achievements.</p>
<p>Here I also want to say: Thank you to the playwright Yu Ling for allowing me to direct this play, so that the audience can understand through this performance the lives of this group of weak and over-exploited dance hall sisters, so as to give them a lot of encouragement and help, so that they will not end their unfortunate body and mind with passive suicide, but will actively strengthen, tenaciously, and strive towards the bright future of liberating their lives. This is also the painstaking effort of the Mutual Aid Troupe to participate in this unprecedented "grand event" in the history of Chinese drama at this time and place, hoping for abundant fruits.</p>

<h3>Miss Chen Yanyan tearfully talks sadly: Film is my life (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Leng Fang's Notes</p>
<p>－－A lifetime of regretful film history－－</p>
<p>…Her debut work was Spring in the South</p>
<p>One year after coming to Shanghai, she first appeared on the silver screen, starring in "Spring in the South". The director, Mr. Cai Chusheng, was also doing his first solo work. Because she had no acting experience, she really made a fool of herself when she went on stage. She didn't understand anything. Fortunately, Mr. Cai patiently taught her and happily overcame this first difficulty under his careful guidance. Later, "Spring in the South" was filmed and released. The general reviews and box office situation were surprisingly good. I was also considered to have succeeded because of him and established a foothold in the film industry. Therefore, I am always grateful for Mr. Cai's kind assistance.</p>
<p>…The hard work of filming caused a deep stomach illness</p>
<p>"It's not human to eat the film industry" This sentence is indeed true. Filming is indeed harder than working in other careers, and it is really extremely tiring. Therefore, to be a film actor, one must have a spirit of enduring hardship and have a strong body, and a weak person will be unable to cope. Like me, in order to rush to film, I often ate irregularly, causing a very deep stomach illness. However, my idea of film work is absolutely to like labor and hate leisure. No matter how hard the work is, I only hope to act in more plays and make more films; the more films I make, the more excited I feel; on the contrary, if I don't have any plays to act in for a long time, it's really more uncomfortable than anything else. Because I believe that film is my life. Acting is extremely hard but I will never feel bored; if I really don't let me film, I simply can't hope to continue to survive.</p>
<p>…Every time I act in a tragedy, I shed real tears</p>
<p>I have acted in dozens of films before, and most of them were tragedies. The general opinion is that I am more suitable for performing tragedies; but I have no fixed opinion and I hope to play many different roles. It is best if I have the opportunity to try out all kinds of different personalities. Regarding the performance of tragedies, I have a prejudice, that is, I absolutely do not want to use fake tears. There is a kind of potion that you put under your eyes, and although it looks very realistic, it can be seen that it is stagnant and will not drip down when shooting long shots. Every time I encounter this kind of performance, I only need to move my true feelings, and I will shed a lot of tears myself. However, in the photography studio, sometimes when I see others performing this real weeping performance, I can't help but laugh.</p>
<p>A lifetime of regret is an infinite pain in my film history, and it is also an invisible encouragement that makes me work hard and be positive. Now that I have achieved some small achievements, my father has passed away for many years, and his tomb has long been arched! Alas! Besides entrusting my whole life to the film industry and striving for progress, what else can I do to redeem this great sin? (End)</p>
<h3>Chatting about the romance between film actors and dance girls</h3>
<p>— Yu Yihua</p>
<p>During the Shanghai Amateur Drama Circle's Charity Performance Week, the 27th was Lan Lan's directed "Flowers Sprinkled with Tears". The dance hall members of the "Mutual Aid Troupe" participated in this performance, such as Yang Wenying, Wei Chuyun, Lily Zhang (namely Zhang Xinzhu in Yuan Muzhi's directed "City Scenery"), and Lily Fang, etc. And this Yang Wenying, who plays Mimi, is now rumored to be in love with Bai Yun, a Guohua actor, so one day when they were rehearsing, the author talked to them about this issue.</p>
<p>That day, they were rehearsing the scene where Mimi commits suicide. When Yang Wenying was holding the cigarette tin as if she was drinking Lysol, I had just talked to Wei Chuyun about Bai Yun, and Yang Wenying heard it, and slammed the cigarette tin on the table, angrily saying: "Talking to yourself"</p>
<p>Wei Chuyun and Yang Wenying are old friends. They once lived together in an upstairs room of a wood shop on Jing'an Temple Road, and they went in and out together. They can be said to be sworn friends, so Wei Chuyun paid very close attention to the records of the Yang Bai romance incident. However, perhaps Wei Chuyun's emotions were a little calmer. Seeing Yang Wenying's angry appearance, she said:</p>
<p>"Rehearse your play properly." Then she said to me: "It is common for dance girls to be talked about by others. Of course, there is some reason for Yang Wenying and Bai Yun, that is, when our Dance Industry Women's Association was established last month, we performed a play at the Carlton once, and Bai Yun participated in our performance through the introduction of a friend. At that time, because the Dance Association could not find a meeting place, the rehearsal was temporarily borrowed from Yang Wenying's new home. Perhaps it was because of the relationship between rehearsing and acting that the rumor of romance spread."</p>
<p>"Therefore, I feel that: Wei Chuyun really became agitated like Ding Xiang, our Dance Association should strive for development, so that the general sisters can know their status and personality, being a dance girl is not lowly, as long as they live seriously, outsiders will naturally change their eyes to look at us!"</p>
<p>At the same time, friends also met Bai Yun, and he also tried his best to deny it. He said: I want to act in a few plays properly.</p>
<p>Dance girls and film actors are all living people. We have no reason to oppose their love, but it is precisely because they are dance girls and film actors that they attract special attention. To change the eyes of outsiders, you have to work hard as a price; romance is a small problem.</p>

<h3>Big King, Second King – A Tale of Two Heroes Fighting in the Wilderness (Part 3)</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>— Random Memories from Beside the Plum Tree (5) —</p>
<p>On this day, the colleagues backstage were both surprised and taken aback! They secretly dispatched a martial arts performer to follow them and investigate. They watched as the two men walked to Black Dragon Pool. The martial arts performer hid himself on a "mound" amidst the desolate reeds and weeds, holding his breath to observe from a high vantage point. If he hadn't looked, it would have been fine! But upon seeing what he saw, the specially appointed envoy was so frightened that his "tongue almost came out and couldn't go back in"! He quickly "whipped his horse" and returned to the backstage, reporting the situation to his colleagues. Everyone who heard it was terrified! Fearing for their lives, the entire troupe rushed to "Black Dragon Pool"!</p>
<p>Before they even reached the battlefield, they could see from afar "smoke billowing, rocks flying, fists and feet clashing, like a rabbit leaping and a dragon ascending." The two heroes were fighting fiercely, evenly matched. Suddenly, they saw so many people coming and knew that their secret had been exposed. It was a pity that "after building a mountain to nine levels, the work was ruined by a single basketful"! They didn't even greet the crowd but only sighed at each other, waving their hands silently! At this moment, their expressions were like "Yue Wu Mu receiving twelve gold tablets halfway, regretting not being able to 'directly attack Huanglong and drink to your heart's content'!" Everyone approached and first offered some words of comfort. Looking at their bodies, they were all bruised and battered, like two colored maps. Only then did everyone realize the real reason why they refused to change their underwear when playing roles backstage. Everyone asked them, "What great feud do you two have that you need to duel here?" The answers given by the two heroes were truly mysterious! They said, "Even we ourselves don't know why! But before fighting, we always felt a bit of a grudge when we met. Since we started fighting, we've actually felt much better! You ask us why we're doing this, and we really don't know why!" Everyone who heard them was both amused and annoyed! They could only give them a slight warning and rebuke. They picked up their clothes from the ground, helped them dress neatly, and walked back to the city together, sending them home.</p>
<p>The next day, after a public discussion among the backstage colleagues, a banquet was held to make peace. The two men immediately declared in public, "We will never act so recklessly again!" This martial arts drama, "Dragon Tiger Gate," was finally closed.</p>
<p>Later, according to their own admission, they had been arguing for a month. Although neither side had clearly won, Xu Deyi seemed to have a slight advantage in comparison. Therefore, the backstage colleagues called Xu Deyi "Big (homophone) King" and Zhu Xiangquan "Second King," and this nickname still exists to this day.</p>
<p>Louis Hayward in "The Man in the Iron Mask" wears an iron mask, and his expression is terrifying enough. It is said that during the filming process, if he was thirsty, he could only use a very thin rubber tube to suck water from a bottle. In fact, it was also very difficult for him to breathe in it.</p>
