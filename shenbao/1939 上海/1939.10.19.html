<p>美國的中立法修正案，已經在彼國會中討論甚久。本案要點有二：一廢止軍火禁運條款；一予各交戰國以九十天期的信用放款。據日昨華盛頓電稱，原提議人參院外交委員會主席畢德門，己將第二項自動撤消，俾廢止軍火禁運條款迅速通過。畢氏這决所提出的中立法修正案，具有極濃厚的正義感；目前雖還有少數孤立派份子，堅持着狹義中立的成見；但以美國一般人民的酷愛民治，主持公道，此案或可於最近期內得到合理的解決。</p>
<p>美國修正中立法的用意，實因鑒於現行中立法，在事實上予民治國以不利；但一經修正，廢止了軍火禁運條款，若其效力範圍，不僅限於歐洲，則在遠東，勢將發生相反的結果。因爲現買自運之法，在歐洲的英法兩國，擁有强大的海軍，和巨量的商輪，自得享有取給美國的便利；但遠東的中國，既無强大的海軍，又無航行遠洋的商輪，她所要求於美國的物質供給，便恐因此而完全斷絕；而日本却可利用這個條款，去向美國購買軍火物料。雖中日未經宣戰，美國中立法不適用於中日之間，但在法律上日本既得現買自運，而在事實上又有誰爲中國代運？因此之故，中立法修正之後，美國爲遠東時局計，還須在經由法律手續，另定補救方法。</p>
<p>原來遠東與歐洲的局勢不同，美國與兩地的關係亦各有不同。許多目光遠大的美國人士，認爲美國對於遠東，應較歐洲特別重視，因爲美國和中國在地理上和經濟上的關係，實甚密切。美國參議院中多數議員，都以爲日本若在中國獲勝，將使美國陷於危險地位；甚至有表示中國今日實爲美國而戰的。在過去二年多的中國英勇抗戰期內，美國政府和人民，曾予以不少物質上的助力，和精神上的鼓勵；而美國的遠東國策，自一九一八」「七七」以至現在，更沒有絲毫的改變。羅斯福總統和赫爾國務卿曾再三聲明尊重九國公的，和保持中國領土主權的完整；最近美國政府又特別加强太平洋上的海空軍力，宣布廢止一九一一年的美日商的，這都是表示美國具有堅持遠東政策的決心</p>
<p>目前所辯論的廢止軍火禁運條款，對於中國當然不利；但是有理由可以相信美國既能對歐洲發揚其正義感，對遠東又何嘗不可以採取同樣的行動。畢德門在提出中立法修正案後，曾一再引用日本慘殺中國人民的事實，爲必需實行「現金自運」的辯護；本月三日在議會中與孤立派健將波拉舌戰時，又謂美國曾不斷將各種製造軍火原料售於日本，故日本在中國的大屠殺，美國無異於參加其事。而日昨民主黨參議員季賚德更明白表示現金自運，將對中國爲一直接的打擊；美國與遠東的關係非比尋常，故此項事實必須顧及。美國國會人士既提示日本在遠束的侵略行動，以說明有修正中立法，使英法獲得援助的必要；既深知中美關係密切而主張美國有兼顧遠東的必要，那麼在中立法修正案辯論後，對於遠東方面，亦將有所表示，這不但一般人所期待的，也是很有可能性的。</p>
<p>中立法是法律案件，修正中立法是立法手續，我們也得不問這决美國國會辯論與表決的結果如何，而深信美國對於遠束政策，仍必有種種方法以維持其堅强的基礎。羅斯福總統屢决宣稱反對武力干涉爲美國的對外政策，觀於現時美國對於日本之以武力侵略中國，消極的「不承認主義」「時代早經過去；目前正是隨着美國艦隊集中太平洋的大演習，而同樣開始積極的踏進抗爭的時代。美國的公民，也已經是覺悟到保護他們自已的權益，應不惜與太平洋上的侵略國家作戰；所以我們儘可不必顧念修正中立法的前途如何而對於遠東局勢有所不安。須知中國目前所需要的，還在不辭艱苦的持久抗戰；時間所積，必使國際的同情與援助，積成堅强偉大的力量。</p>

<p>烚赤未分榮辱</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開人氣虛弱、賣者頗多、某錢兌業吐售更切、開市竟撳小十元、某錢兌業賣予同業二十兩、價爲四千元、瞬又撳小二元、某錢兌業又吐予金號三十兩、爲三千九百九十八元、嗣證券帮趁低吸收、散戶亦稍跟進、不久即回高十二元、證券帮進錢兌業十兩、爲四千零十元、時某金號忽起賣風、且銀樓帮等亦套賣數十兩、遂步小五元、某金號賣予銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千零零五元、旋聞外匯略軟、買方前來拉提、未幾即回至四千零十元關口、但其時證券帮突代港帮力吸三百餘兩、致又拉高至四千零十四元、均由銀樓帮及金號等供給、將近午刻、證券帮忽止扒反出、遂回小四元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲四千零十元、後復做高二元、錢兌業進證券帮十兩、爲四千零十二元作午收價、午後初時因某錢兌業突懷賣意、開市即做小四元、某錢兌業賣予金號一十兩、爲四千零零八元、後又力塞數十兩、遂再降落二元、某錢兌業售予同業三十兩、爲四千零零六元、入後某證券帮前來收買、且售者已觀望不前、復回升四元、某證券帮進金號二十兩、爲四千零十元作晚收價、結果與上日未分榮辱、全天十六元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進須减小三十元之譜、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交，</p>

<p>又衆業公所昨日股市、一般興趣、未見消减、經紀入方面、因委託擁擠、顯甚忙碌、但無急遽騷亂演出、價格維持亦佳、會得豐股回復至前日六十二元高峯、耶松船廠股見一百七十六元半新高價、電話公司股繼續挺進至十八元、苟銀根長此鬆動、而各大戶對市塲猶思切意維護、則價格欲其支持不墜、亦甚易易、然設一旦獲利多頭、大量出籠、或外匯市塲、而足重用優酬資金時、則情勢驟趨逆轉、亦未可知、屆時無論投資者或投機者對於目下超越自身能力之作爲、或有反悔之一日、</p>

<p>本棉交易、大見減色、良以紗市步步不振、各廠對於原料、無意補進、交易轉趨靜寂、中外各廠隻包未辦、僅同業中進通州花一千包、價爲一百三十五元至三十七元、鈔票棧交、蘇北來源、到通州花一千五百四十丸包、又北沙來五千一百七十包云、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨日因紐約棉市之堅定、人心因之頗爲盛旺、廠方雖尚抱覜望、同業已有始始訂購美棉者、爲數雖甚巨、開的有千包之數云、此項美棉可供紡二十支之用、按照目前之匯率、合送廠價祇一百七十元、然較之高級通州、品級則高多多、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初殊爲堅定、利物沛及孟買來電俱屬良好、投機商購買頗爲踴躍、紡織界亦因布疋之暢銷、進胃頗健、又因同業之購買、及華爾街股票市價之堅挺而漲、結果較之上日價格、棉價漲起八至十叫磅音、印度連同預測漲二羅比、埃及跌五六磅音、利物浦漲叫便士、</p>

<p>上海難民救濟協會市民組勸募委員會於昨日下午二時假座寗波同鄉會舉行贈獎大會、到協會代表虞洽卿·徐寄廎·袁履登·方椒伯。暨勸募隊長認養善士朱啟禎·嚴柏林·等二百餘人、大會主席林康侯、司儀張一塵、總幹事劉仲英·葛福田、首由主席林康侯</p>
<p>致開會詞、略謂、諸位先生、今天本會舉行增獎大會、承各大善士、各隊隊長、協會各位領袖、惠臨參加、非常感幸、本會此决舉行贈獎大會、是有兩個意思、第一是惑謝諸位過去對本會的贊助、第二是希望諸位今後繼續帮忙、本會自去年十二月十日成立、截至本年九月底止、十個月中共勸募認養難民一萬六千四百九十四名、捐款總額已收米收共</p>
<p>三十二萬</p>
<p>四千餘元（詳細數字請參　大會特刋）、本會得有此成續、皆賴各位大善士的慷慨捐助、各位隊長的熱心勸募、今天舉行贈獎大會、木人謹代表難胞、向諸位表示深切的謝意、難民救濟工作、目前又臨到困難的階段、最大的原因、是物價騰貴、難民給養開支、比較過去增加一倍以上、以前難民給養每名每月兩元、現已加到</p>
<p>每月五元</p>
<p>其他醫藥事務經費、也不免跟着提高、同時寒冬將屆、難民棉被棉衣、亦須預爲籌辦、因此救濟款項、至感急切、而各界前認捐款、又適多於此時滿期、在此困難階段、協會因此有繼續推進勸募工作的決議、回想去年今日、協會在此舉行成立大會、到今天恰是一週紀念、當去年協會成立後、各界即分頭推動勸募工作、一年來盡了很</p>
<p>偉大任務</p>
<p>今天市民組勸募委員會又在此舉行贈獎大會、希望在座諸位暨各界人士、仍秉着協會初成立時的精神、繼續贊助、出錢出力、以加惠災黎、末了請協會各領袖給我們指導、决由虞洽鄉袁履登方椒伯陶樂勤相繼致詞勗勉、末由徐寄廎主持給獎、獎品分匾額銳框鏡盾獎章等四種、依照捐款及勸募成績之多寡、分別送、情况殊爲熱烈、</p>

<p>援助孤兒</p>
<p>對於助使難民復興之實業工作、亦予以銀錢上之瓖助、已往兩載中基金處直接與間接援助受戰殃之男婦老幼與農民工人等者、無從計數、目下已央行政委員會正圖覔致以其款項應付依然存在的大需要之最佳方法、太古公司近</p>
<p>助五千鎊</p>
<p>而使委員會能加撥款項、供四川救濟工作之用、天津發生洪水後、基金處立即以大批醫院供應品運往該地、各小組委員會對於所接款項、記有嚴密賬目、而救濟代理機關對於所接款項如何耗去、多供給詳細報告、自此等代理機關與其他方面發來函件、足證衆對英國基金處所完成之工作、</p>
<p>極表謝忱</p>
<p>基金處所發款項多寡不等、中央行政委員會於九月間會議、分配款項、數額計分八種、最多二千鎊、最少六百元、中央行政委員會於已往兩年中派出款項、共計十三萬鎊左右、在倫敦之委員會旣已耗資的四萬鎊採辦醫藥供應品與其他物料、故倫敦與上海兩委員會所存款項日趨减少、深盼各界繼續捐助、則感謝良深矣、（完）</p>

<p>— 時光</p>
<p>已經逝世了三年了，我們底偉大的文豪魯迅先生。他是全中國，以至全世界的靑年底導師，是一個革命的現實主義的作家，他一生的奮鬥是爲着民族和社會的解放和改革，同時也爲着全世界整個人類。</p>
<p>用他至高的藝術的技巧，寫出許多論文散文，小說，暴露了社會的腐敗和黑暗，指承着一條大衆走的光明大道。</p>
<p>魯迅先生的一生就對着虛僞，奸詐和醜惡而戰鬥，更反對懦弱的機會主義者，和×奸。他是中國的高爾基，領導着許多民族革命的大衆作家。他參加了統一的民族戰錢。在一九三五年，他組織了反法西斯的團體，予野蠻的法西斯一個有力的驅逐！</p>
<p>「一個作家，當然需要必需的技能，但是更需要進步的意識，和高昻的人類的尊嚴……我們需要那些能够作爲先鋒的，和指示道路的作家。」魯迅先生這樣的說。他自己就是這樣的一位實踐者。他站在全中國全世界的人類底最前列，他不是僞善者，不肯放過敵人，雖然會受到迫害，攻擊，毀謗和威脅，他依舊很活躍，勇敢地前進。</p>
<p>他不愧是被壓迫階級和被壓迫民族底戰友，一個新釣革命的模範作家；他的偉大的人格和偉大的藝術作品，眞是大衆的模範。我們應該學習他。</p>
<p>他不妥洽的戰鬥精神，和對於人類的熱愛，將永遠地保存在全中國全世界人類的心裏，雖然他在三年前已經死了，但他的藝術，精神就永遠地活在世界上，生生世世，不會消滅！</p>
<p>魯迅先生他一定能够微笑着長眠在地下的，因爲目前中華一兒女已正在前綫，在後方，努力從事於這偉大的民族解放戰爭</p>

<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>——京滬綫戰地追記——</p>
<p>夜，十月的夜。</p>
<p>天幕也沒有鑲嵌着的秋月，更沒有瞅着眼的羣星；是一片烏黑。</p>
<p>連續的秋雨，把公路攪得滿是汚泥。路面上刻畫着條條的車轍：沿着車轍蹣跚着一輛汽車，二千件棉背心，十九個同志。</p>
<p>好容易一個車輪從泥縫中爬起，却又陷下一個，任憑車輪轉動得如何迅速，車却並不肯移動，車身顚簸得像浪濤中的汽輪。同志都把身體伏在棉衣上。</p>
<p>在朦朧中，覺得車身受震得特別厲害；問車夫，說陷得太深了，非設法减輕重量不可</p>
<p>揉醒了惺忪的眼，帶着囈語般的口調，各自在黑暗中摸索，着了鞋子，爬下汽車，一落地，汚泥就掩沒了鞋面。然而並沒有一個去惋惜髒了的皮鞋，感覺到的紙有高興，像回復到了孩提時代地打起了精神</p>
<p>忙着在路旁找了些稻草，鋪了一大塊，把棉背心一件件從軍廂中搬了出來，誰都熱望着在棉背心沒有運完之前，車就能跳出了深潭；但僅僅聽見引擎在笨重地怒吼，汚泥遼是陷住了四輪，直到最後一件背心離開車廂時，仍兀立着不動</p>
<p>我們開始焦急，要是不能脫離這深潭，天明後就不宜在這隣近前綫的地方行動。</p>
<p>「是需要有力出力的時候了！」同志中吼起巨大的聲音，接着一片泥和鞋子的攪聲，同志們迅速地分佈在車身的後邊和左右。</p>
<p>「大家一齊用力推……嗨唷哼……」</p>
<p>二十幾條手臂，撐住車身；司機開足了馬力，輪子有些向前的樣子，追求着新的希望，各人的臂上多增了一分力。</p>
<p>「大家努力，一齊向前，大家……</p>
<p>推出前面的泥潭……」</p>
<p>歌聲助長了臂力，終於「嘓」的一聲，車脫離了潭穴，駛進另一條較淺的軌道裏去，新的希望來了，歡笑聲突破了　穆的黑暗。</p>
<p>更有勁的裝好背心，脫去滿是汚泥的鞋子，爬進車廂；在若斷若續的機器振動聲中，軍叉像沙漠中的駱駝似的緩緩地爬動，車廂裹又發出一陣滿足的笑聲，疲倦不再來侵襲每個人。</p>
<p>然而畢竟因爲公路沒有輕鬆地休養過，創傷太厲害了；車行不久，在一條小溪邊又被阻了，車傾斜在一邊。</p>
<p>同志們的談笑聲，給這打擊煞住了；套上潮的鞋，又輕輕地跨出車廂，沿車巡視一週，覺得這决單靠我們十幾個人的力量不够的了；借着電筒的力一看時計，離天明還有相當時間，輕鬆了好些；留着車夫鎮守車輛，我們由一位熟悉當地情形的同志底領導，在黑暗中摸索到附近鄉長的家裏去。</p>
<p>爲了不得已，忍心打開鄉長家的門；開鬥來的正是鄉長，年近四十光景，我們把來意很婉轉的說明了，並表示十分的歉意。</p>
<p>一這是國家的事，做老百姓的應該出力，你們一定辛苦了；且休息一下，讓我去招呼幾個壯丁來帮助你們，他們是熟於此事的，這不是第一决了。」邊說邊燃着燈籠，匆匆地出去了。</p>
<p>同志們底心更活躍得厲害</p>
<p>片刻，地長帶領着十幾個年靑的壯漢，提着各式的亮子，抬着竹槓木板來了。我們迎上去，大家一回上路。</p>
<p>一路上沒有聽到一句怨話。他們都是從甜夢中被驚攪過來的呢。</p>
<p>用純熟的技術，合羣的力量，並沒有减輕車的載重，車就推上了正路；同志們對這批壯漢是說不出的感激，沒有虛僞的套語，祇在面部流露出熱誠的謝意。</p>
<p>最後，鄉長告訴我們前面的路基結實得多了，我們致謝了鄉長和十幾個年靑人，登上汽車，在黑暗中消逝了十幾個和　而誠樸的臉。</p>
<p>東方透露出微薄的曙光，我們繼續踏上了征途。</p>

<h3 id="c97">山靈 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>封鎖了一片靜的領域，落葉慢慢地在秋深時堆得厚起來，沒有一個人走過，帶一點城市的泥染上去。假使這山上樹木栽得很多，自然便更陰森，枝柯交侵着，張羅成一片繖，遮絕了陽光和風爾，樹底下大熱天避暑是一個上好的淸凉地。即使大雨，漏下的也不很多。然而這些我總不愛。我不能不想起那太厚太猛密的樹葉了。你說吧枝兒葉兒虬結在一堆，分別不出誰是在誰樹上的，光綫該多麽暗。心上彷彿給一方黑紗包裹着，有恐怖，有煩躁，也象徵着眼前一片陰影。過靜的空氣中，連用一隻指爪挺立在樹上的烏鴉細微的呼吸聲也聽得着。鐘聲不知從那兒響起了，陰陰的山中變得道麽震慄，像一條蜿蜒有光的絲帶牽引着一顆心走向高處與遠處，空中閃爍了幾下，便又黑暗，結果這絲帶自然是斷了。</p>
<p>斷了……那麽你心上是不是感到一陣空虛，陰鬱壓逼着黑暗包圍着你？你覺得這山眞的有一副雄渾的感傷的生命？在黃昏時陰暗的山谷，你可以從靜中體味到生命的顫慄。你屈服於自然，也驚訝牠們的神秘。也許你離開了熟識的山的容顏，你們有過深長的友誼，你認識山上的每一株樹，每一塊石頭，每一朶花。你的認識絕和別人不同，你腦中另有一副容顏，牠們變成你的花，你的石，你的橋，你的朋友。因此你和遊魚鷗鳥們訂下盟的，那麼一座山在你眼睛裏看來幷不嚴肅而是可親。你該說山靈不是恐怖而是可愛的朋友……唉，山也眞太多，你我那兒怕都有山？「粗看兩不厭，惟有敬亭山」，誰沒有一個可愛的山在滿天烽火時引起自己的牽墨呢？你都不能小懷想牠們的朝夕的，那朝暾初起時，晚霞絢爛時，山嵐朦朧時，烟雨脊濛時，夕陽返照時，……</p>
<p>給牠們牽罣但幷不憐惜。山靈不像一件受人撫弄的小物件，牠包含着一副雄偉的身軀，高傲的氣勢，和健實的體態。在晴天牠最早的罩上高高的太陽，陰天牠却又披上一層厚重的烟霏。日間牠開朗，夜裏牠陰森。祇要你有一個有山的家鄉，你會愛那山的。你每年能跑去遊玩幾次，你更會認識那座山幷不僅是山，那兒有一個無名的山靈，你辨得出那些花，草，岩石，樹木和精舍的聲明，你能用一顆心體味出牠們千萬不同的情感。</p>
<p>當牠們憔悴的時候，也一樣說明了你的抑鬱。你的家鄉有山嗎？山是不是依舊呢？…………自然囉，我不能不眷念一個多山的城市。大江的黨秀告訴人民的智慧，山野的敦厚敎會人民的質樸。鄰江的山是開期的，沙洲的山是蕭疎的，島嶼的山是縹渺的，牠們說明了多種不同的性格。在幼小時我認識牠們的平靜，離亂後我再看出牠們的抑鬱。六七個月的光陰把山靈弄成憔悴，但艱苦也把牠折磨得更潑刺了。山蒼老了些，但濤聲似乎較前有力</p>
<p>住在家鄉的人也曾看過你們的家山？山靈是怎麽個樣兒？憔悴些了？憤怒些了？山的心你知道。你知道山靈的憤怒，你知道關山的黑，楓林的靑，你也知道用崇高，雄偉和堅實來體會山的生命。你決不僅作舊夢的憑弔；你也陪牠憤怒，陪牠復仇。儘管那封鎖着一片靜，然而這中心是蘊藏着火山的烈燄的，這是山靈的也是你的咆哮，比你眷念允爲可感</p>

<p>— 亞爾倍</p>
<p>——中華戲劇會集體創作</p>
<p>從事兒童戲劇的確不大容易，它的劇情，含意，對白，動作都有它獨特的地方。劇情一定要像晴天樣的明朗，泉水泠泠的音響，神話般活潑的含意，很爽直的寓意，很簡易的對白，音樂化的動作配合寓有想像的圖案化的裝置，更要使全塲面充滿了欣欣向榮生動的空氣，展開一條樂觀的大道，在兒童的意識裏揭起自强不息的精神。</p>
<p>用普通成人的劇本來充兒童劇是很不合埋的，兒童劇一定要對準兒童爲目標而創作，而且劇作者還須是富有天眞思想和透悉兒童心理的，那他所寫出來的境界才是兒童的境界</p>
<p>兒童不適宜看悲劇，因爲他們不沾塵埃的純潔心靈，還沒經歷過像成人般的人世滄桑。最好還是鬧劇和喜劇好，鬧得有意思，喜得有含蓄，那就到達「眞善美」的境界了。</p>
<p>中華戲劇研究會最近聽說在集體創作幾個兒童劇，預備供給兒童戲劇組的演出，在中國兒童劇荒蕪的園地，這消息眞是一支有希望的新苗。聞該會假新都星期兒童劇塲第二次演出的，有歐陽　華執筆集體創作的兒童劇：「小五義」云。</p>

<p>—梅邊雜憶之六—</p>
<p>日常生活</p>
<p>梅先生的生活也很簡單。他每天九時許起身，（演戲時遲寢例外。）向例是不進晨養的。漱洗後，便走進他的書室，看看報及外來信件，寫幾張大楷。十二時午飯，菜也不過是四葷兩素一湯，自奉並不怎樣的華貴。不計珍饈或藜藿，總是盡飯二盂。辣品有礙於嗓音，故不入口。此外凡是食物，並不剔選。嶺南有一種異味名曰禾蟲，狀如去殼之蝸牛，長寸許，畜以水晶杯，色彩斑駮，粤人帶活生呑，梅先生亦嗜此，且甘之如飴焉。（按禾蟲，爲廣東近海稻田所產。據「廣東新語」載，有長至丈者。節節有口，生靑，熱紅黃。夏秋間，蚤晚稻熟，則其蟲亦熟。潮長浸田，因乘潮斷節而出，日浮夜沉，浮則水面皆紫。其形狀之怪異，令人一見生畏，何况帶活生吞！）飯後，則從湯滌之先生習畫梅。問日從英籍敎師習英語。功課旣畢，則與過訪友好週旋，或有接洽，亦於此時辦理，有條不紊。夜間，則赴友人宴會居多。間或與二三知己小集市樓，不飮酒，飮亦不及醉。夜飯後，喜觀電影。當他進塲之時，必待燈光熄滅之後，不然座客　綫，必都集中在他的身上。趨前道傾慕之忱者有之，請求簽之者亦有之，那眞成山陰道上，有應接不暇之勢了！觀影歸來後，則收聽無綫電，無錢電，成了他唯一的嗜好品，也是他寂寞生活中，精神上尋求安慰的第一良伴。他喜歡接收國外的音樂，允其是德國的Opera，他聽到一個悅耳的音樂後，他能爲之澈夜不眠，不知東方之旣白。</p>

<p>由於以上兩點，一釋迦牟尼」的攝製，在金錢消耗方面將成爲一個驚人的數字，現在，劇本故事正由戲劇家周貽白編寫中，寫好之後還待分幕，大概離開拍尚需相當時期，不過外景攝影隊巳在籌備組織之中，也許下月就耍出發。</p>

<p>員外貝勒候補道</p>
<p>然而同行諸人一來因爲敬重他的爲人，二則欽佩他的能耐出衆，故而大家雖是覺得他道種打扮土氣，但是也不敢用一種譏笑的口吻去嘲弄他，所以結果他竟得了一個李員外的綽號。照理員外是鄉下財主的　號，李老供奉之得此綽號，並不是因爲他有錢有田地，實在還是因爲他的那種裝扮相像罷了。</p>
<p>古今的名伶中就數老譚的派頭大，飮食起居和家中一切設備固然都考究已極，就是私下穿的衣服，也是極力摹仿貝子貝勒等的裝束，叫季的衣服全按夾單皮棉一定的套數次序，逐日更換，白襪，套雲鞋，緞袍，章絨馬褂，瓜皮小帽上鑲着珠玉寳石，手拿鼻烟壺，腰間繫着荷包漢玉，出門時向雙跨緣的轎車上一坐，的確很有個樣兒。同時他寓中每日來來往往的都是些達官貴人貝子貝勒等，同行中瞧他的舉動豪闊，儼如貝子貝勒的勢派，所以譚貝勒這個稱呼也就遍及九城了。</p>
<p>菊仙道人因爲是票友出身，平時極力避免伶人的習氣，照例梨園行人多不留鬚，耍說平日架起眼鏡的，更不多見，但菊仙則不然，一遇休息或不被傳差的日子，他就把鬍鬚留起，（試　拙著梨園影事中，共有名伶照片三曰幀，除塲面及票友不計外，便裝留鬚者只彼一人，且五十八與八十八歲兩照皆有鬚，彼不留鬚之照片，外間從未見過。）鼻間高架墨鏡，緞靴貂帽，身穿皮外套，相貌魁梧，舉止端莊。如其預先不知道他是票友下海的優伶的話，那簡直眞要把他當作一位候捕道啦。而他這候補道的外號，也就是由這上頭得的。一（一二二）</p>

One part of the division then fled north along the original route. A column of over a thousand cavalry and over three thousand infantry fled into Yitiantianmen in the Jiugong Mountain region on the 15th. After reconnaissance by a certain unit of the Hua Jiangxi Northern Army, the Japanese army was lured into favorable terrain for the Chinese army. Then, they were joined by a certain unit of the Hubei Southern Army, which encircled them from the north and south, and attacked them separately. After five days and nights of fierce fighting, the entire Japanese army was routed. The remaining Japanese soldiers broke through the encirclement separately and fled east from the Nanlinqiao area.

<p>No Japanese Aircraft on the Northern Hunan Front. Chongqing: A correspondent with the army in northern Hunan reports that there is indeed no Japanese air force activity on the northern Hunan front. This shows the effectiveness of the Chinese air raid on the Japanese air force base in Hankou. Before the Chinese air raid on Hankou, the Japanese air raids were quite noticeable, but they have now disappeared. The correspondent traveled along the Xiang River to Changsha and did not see any Japanese bombers for several days. Hengyang, which had been subjected to air raids a few days ago, is now quite tranquil, and life in Xiangtan is returning to normal. The only Japanese air force activity seen in Hunan Province is reconnaissance flights by reconnaissance aircraft believed to be flying from Nanchang. (Dispatch from the 18th by Reuters)</p>

(Dispatch from the 18th by Reuters)</p>
<p>Chongqing: In addition to military operations, the Chinese and Japanese armies are now also engaged in economic warfare.

According to news received here, the Japanese are now making efforts to smuggle Japanese goods into the free areas. The Japanese army provides special convenience for smuggling to Japanese merchants whenever it occupies a city bordering the free area.

A regulation has now been drafted, slightly revised by the government, and passed.

<h3 id="e17">The US Revision of the Neutrality Act and the Far East <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The US Neutrality Act amendment has been under discussion in Congress for a long time. The main points of the bill are twofold: first, to repeal the arms embargo clause; and second, to grant credit loans with a term of ninety days to the belligerent countries. According to a Washington dispatch yesterday, Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who originally proposed the amendment, has already voluntarily withdrawn the second item in order to quickly pass the repeal of the arms embargo clause. The Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Pittman has a very strong sense of justice. Although there are still a few isolationist elements who insist on a narrow view of neutrality, the bill may be resolved reasonably in the near future, given the American people's love of democracy and commitment to justice.</p>
<p>The purpose of the US revision of the Neutrality Act is in fact due to the current Neutrality Act, which is actually unfavorable to democratic countries. However, once amended and the arms embargo clause is repealed, if its scope of effect is not limited to Europe, then in the Far East, the opposite result will occur. Because the "cash and carry" law allows England and France in Europe, which have powerful navies and a large number of merchant ships, to enjoy the convenience of obtaining supplies from the United States. However, China in the Far East has neither a powerful navy nor merchant ships sailing the oceans. Her request for material supplies from the United States may be completely cut off as a result. Japan can take advantage of this clause to purchase military materials from the United States. Although China and Japan have not declared war, the US Neutrality Act does not apply between China and Japan. But in law, Japan can purchase goods and transport them itself, and in fact, who will transport them for China? Therefore, after the Neutrality Act is amended, the United States must also establish remedial measures via legal procedures for the sake of the Far East situation.</p>
<p>Originally, the situation in the Far East is different from that in Europe, and the relationship between the United States and the two regions is also different. Many far-sighted Americans believe that the United States should pay more attention to the Far East than to Europe, because the relationship between the United States and China in terms of geography and economy is very close. A majority of senators in the US Senate believe that if Japan wins in China, it will put the United States in a dangerous position; some even say that China is fighting for the United States today. During the past two years of China's heroic resistance, the US government and people have provided considerable material assistance and spiritual encouragement. And the US Far East policy, from "September 18th" to "July 7th" to the present, has not changed in the slightest. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have repeatedly stated that they respect the Nine-Power Treaty and maintain the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. Recently, the US government has also particularly strengthened its naval and air power in the Pacific, and announced the termination of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, all of which indicate that the United States is determined to adhere to its Far East policy.</p>
<p>The currently debated repeal of the arms embargo clause is certainly unfavorable to China. However, there is reason to believe that just as the United States can promote its sense of justice towards Europe, why can't it take similar action towards the Far East? Pittman has repeatedly cited Japan's massacre of the Chinese people as the reason for the necessity of implementing "cash and carry" when proposing the Neutrality Act amendment. During a debate with isolationist champion Borah in Congress on the 3rd of this month, he also stated that the United States has constantly sold various raw materials for manufacturing munitions to Japan, so the United States is no different than participating in Japan's massacre in China. And yesterday, Democratic Senator Gillette clearly stated that cash and carry will be a direct blow to China; the relationship between the United States and the Far East is extraordinary, so this fact must be taken into account. US Congressmen have cited Japan's aggressive actions in the Far East to explain the necessity of amending the Neutrality Act to enable England and France to receive assistance; they know that the relationship between China and the United States is close and advocate that the United States must take into account the Far East. Then, after the Neutrality Act amendment debate, there will also be some expression towards the Far East, which is not only expected by the general public, but also very possible.</p>
<p>The Neutrality Act is a legal case, amending the Neutrality Act is a legislative procedure, and we have to ask what the outcome of the debate and vote in the US Congress will be, and deeply believe that the United States will still have various methods to maintain its strong foundation for its Far East policy. President Roosevelt has repeatedly declared that opposing military intervention is the United States' foreign policy. Seeing that the United States' passive "non-recognition doctrine" towards Japan's military aggression against China has long passed; the era has already passed; the present is the same as the start of active stepping into the era of resistance following the large-scale exercises of the US fleet concentrated in the Pacific. American citizens are already aware that in order to protect their own rights and interests, they should not hesitate to fight against the aggressive countries in the Pacific; so we can rest assured and not be uneasy about the future of the Neutrality Act amendment regarding the situation in the Far East. It must be known that what China needs at present is still to persevere in its difficult and protracted war of resistance; as time accumulates, it will inevitably cause international sympathy and aid to accumulate into a strong and great force.</p>

<p>London, yesterday, air raid sirens sounded throughout Orkney. In Kirkwall, the sirens wailed six times. German planes were reported to have flown over the islands of Flotta and Hoy. However, due to intense anti-aircraft fire from defense forces and warships, the enemy planes flew extremely high. It is said that during one air raid, two bombs fell on civilian houses, but there were no casualties. One German plane was shot down on Hoy Island, and the pilot safely parachuted to the ground and was captured. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London, in the German air attack on British ships in the Firth of Forth, the British death toll has now reached seventeen, as one more soldier has died from his injuries. Three officers have died, including Captain Thorley of HMS Mohawk. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that a German air raid occurred at 10:30 this morning in Scapa Flow, the same location where the British battleship HMS Royal Oak was sunk by a German submarine. Four German planes attacked, dropping two bombs near the 21,250-ton training ship HMS Iron Duke. The ship sustained slight damage, but no one was injured. The HMS Iron Duke is an old, decommissioned battleship, converted into a training ship according to the 1930 London Naval Treaty. One German plane was hit by British fire and crashed in flames, and another is believed to have been damaged. The Prime Minister also mentioned the German air raid on the Firth of Forth, stating that twelve or more German planes, in groups of two or three, repeatedly attacked. There were few civilian casualties; only two people were slightly injured by shrapnel. The crews of HMS Southampton, HMS Edinburgh, and HMS Mohawk suffered some casualties, with three officers killed, two slightly injured, thirteen soldiers killed, eleven seriously injured, and thirty-one slightly injured. HMS Southampton and HMS Edinburgh sustained very minor damage and are ready to sail at any time. The damage to HMS Mohawk was only superficial. British fighters and anti-aircraft guns responded immediately, shooting down a total of four German planes, one of which was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Additionally, several other German planes are believed to have been damaged and unable to return to their base. This attack was local and small in scale, and the British had made various preparations for defense, so it was not considered necessary to issue an air raid alert to avoid disturbances and inconveniences. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London, since the beginning of the war, the scope of German air raids on Britain was the widest today. It is reported that the Germans lost at least six planes. German planes flew twice today to the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland, engaged in combat with British planes off the east and north coasts of Britain, and attacked the steamer St Ola, sailing between Scapa Flow and Stromness in Scotland. Although bombs fell around the St Ola, none hit. One attacking German plane was shot down by land-based anti-aircraft guns. Air raid alerts were issued in more than ten cities, including Ipswich. During the first German flight to the Orkney Islands, Scapa Flow was the concentrated target. The training ship HMS Iron Duke was slightly damaged, but the Germans lost one plane. In the second attack, six and four German planes in two groups, re-attacked the Orkney Islands from 12:30 to 2:30, lasting two hours. According to the Admiralty, the attack caused no damage or casualties. The Germans lost another plane. According to the Air Ministry, in the morning and afternoon, surveillance groups reported German reconnaissance activity along the east coast. Air raid alerts were issued in several areas of Lincolnshire, East Anglia, and Kent. British fighters and anti-aircraft defenses were immediately activated. No bombs were dropped in these areas. One German plane was attacked and chased into the sea off the coast of Yorkshire. British fighters attacked two German planes off the northeast coast today, and both planes were shot down into the sea. One crew member has been rescued. All British planes returned safely to base. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam, it is widely believed that a German port near the Dutch coast, Emden, was bombed yesterday morning. Artillery fire was heard near the Dutch border, and planes were seen soaring through the clouds. Around 11:00 AM, the artillery fire was dense. Onlookers could not count the number of planes or identify their nationality. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London, the Air Ministry has just issued a message stating that around noon today, British air defense forces reported that one German plane was scouting the east coast. As a result, alarms were sounded in twelve places, including Foulness, Hull, Flamborough, and Grimsby. Our air force took to the skies in preparation for battle, and anti-aircraft gunners prepared to fire. The German plane was eventually driven away without dropping any bombs. (Havas, 17th) London, the Information Ministry has just announced that two German planes appeared over the northeast coast. Our fighters immediately flew to intercept them and shot them both down. One pilot has been rescued. Our planes have all returned safely to base. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>London, the Admiralty has just released a communiqué stating, "A German aircraft group, the first team of six aircraft and the second team of four aircraft, flew to bomb the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland (Scapa Bay is located there) from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM today." This was the second time. We suffered no losses and no casualties. It is said that one German plane was destroyed. Another message said that one German plane was shot down into the sea near Stromness Island in Pentland Firth, and another was severely damaged. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>London, the British ship St Ola, sailing between Scapa Flow and Stromness, was attacked by German planes this morning, which dropped many bombs at it, but none hit. The coastal anti-aircraft guns immediately opened fire and shot down one plane. (Havas, 17th) Berlin, regarding the German Air Force's bombing of the British fleet at Scapa Flow, the following official report was released last night, "On October 17, the German Air Force went to Scapa Flow to heavily bomb the British fleet docked in the bay, hitting one battleship and several other ships. It also engaged in aerial combat with British fighter planes, shooting down one British plane. Although German bombers were under intense anti-aircraft fire and pursued by fighter planes, all returned safely to base." (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam, according to the British Admiralty, a group of German bombers flew to bomb military targets on the Orkney Islands yesterday afternoon between 12:30 PM and 2:30 PM. (Haitong, 18th) London, officials announced that German planes again attacked the Scottish naval base yesterday. Two teams of German bombers flew over the Orkney Islands between 12:30 PM and 2:30 PM. During the German attack, the British suffered no casualties, and the German planes did not damage any targets. It was reported that one German plane was shot down by British anti-aircraft guns. The Admiralty announced that the German planes attacked "in two teams, one of six and one of four." (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Winschoten, Netherlands, observers here believe that British bombers bombed German naval buildings and shipyards in Emden yesterday. Several planes flew across the border directly toward the Emden shipyards. Minutes later, the sound of explosions came from that location. The planes flew too high to be identified, but observers believe they were British planes observing the planes flying north toward the German naval base on Borkum Island. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin, the German High Command issued a statement this afternoon stating that after French troops between the Moselle and the Walde abandoned their occupied territory and retreated, German troops pursued them and captured many enemy soldiers. Yesterday, the German Air Force continued to bomb British coastal naval bases. One old-style British battleship and several warships docked in Scapa Flow either received hits from heavy bombs or medium-sized bombs and sustained damage. British fighter planes took off to respond, one of which was shot down by German planes. At the same time, one German plane was shot down by British anti-aircraft guns. A total of ten enemy planes were lost on October 16 and 17, five of which were shot down by German anti-aircraft guns in German airspace, and the other five were shot down by German planes during aerial combat in British airspace.

<h3 id="e19">Results of the German Offensive on the Western Front: French Troops Retreat to the Border; German Offensive Halted <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Paris, the General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 87 this evening, stating, "Although fierce fighting occurred between the infantry of both sides on the front lines today, the positions of both sides have not changed since this morning. In addition, our Atlantic Fleet captured a German merchant ship." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris, the French Army released War Bulletin No. 88 last night, stating that Allied infantry clashed with German troops at several points on the Western Front yesterday. The German army has temporarily abandoned its plan to attack the French Maginot Line. (Associated Press, 18th) Paris, the two recent French bulletins regarding the German offensives east of the Saar indicate significant changes in the fighting on the Western Front. After the collapse of the Polish army, the French commander decided to reorganize the French defenses that extended into German territory to their furthest point, constructing lightly manned watchtowers and dispersing troops. As expected, after heavy artillery bombardment, with most shells landing in open areas, the Germans launched a fierce offensive. At that time, the French outposts retreated according to the planned steps, while using machine guns and artillery to bombard the concentrated German troops and inflict heavy damage. When the German army reached the actual French defense line two and a half miles outside Saarlouis, near the village of Apach, they were blocked by the French army and could not advance. It is widely believed that the German army suffered more losses than gains, gaining little but suffering heavy losses. The fact that the German army encountered resistance and was blocked everywhere is of great significance. Tanks or planes were not used in the battle. The French army is still fighting within German territory. The German army must capture four to six lines of heavily defended positions before they can reach the Maginot Line. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris, the German army launched two major offensives yesterday, the first on the east bank of the Moselle River, on a front six kilometers long, and the second on the east bank of the Saar River, on a front thirty kilometers long, both within German territory. At that time, most of the French army had already withdrawn, leaving only a few outpost troops, so the German army made progress without much difficulty. However, in the past two weeks, the French army had meticulously established a line of resistance behind the outposts. As a result, when the German army reached this line last night, it was met with a dense barrage of machine-gun and artillery fire, like an impenetrable wall, and could not advance a single step. It was impossible even to use hand grenades to attack. Their offensive has now been halted. According to various observers, the German army crossed French minefields during this offensive and suffered heavy shelling, and their losses must have been very heavy. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin, according to a communiqué issued by the German High Command, French troops continued to withdraw from German territory between the Moselle and the Palatinate Forest along the border yesterday. It also stated that one British fighter plane was shot down by the Germans in aerial combat and admitted that one German plane was destroyed and crashed by British anti-aircraft guns. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, yesterday evening, newspapers here prominently featured or published extras on the news of French troops withdrawing from a certain area near Saarbrücken. People here are paying close attention to this, saying that the French had previously claimed that the German army had voluntarily withdrawn from the area for strategic reasons, and the French had advanced and occupied it, which was a great military success for France. According to French official reports, the French army had previously launched an offensive against German positions in order to restrain the German army and alleviate the pressure on the Polish army. However, two weeks ago, high-ranking French officers decided to withdraw the French army to its original defense. Relevant Danish authorities have commented that now that the Polish war is over, it is noteworthy whether France will continue to occupy German territory or attempt to do so. (Haitong, 18th) Geneva, after the news of the French troops who had occupied German territory returning to France spread, Swiss newspapers believe that this is a symbolic gesture of France temporarily abandoning its offensive against Germany. It is said that in mid-September, rumors spread that the French army planned to take large-scale action, but when Soviet troops entered Poland and attacked the rear of the Polish army, the French army abandoned its large-scale plan. Judging from the recent situation, this seems to be based on some truth. Swiss newspapers believe that the French military authorities have again decided to adopt a defensive strategy.

<p>Moscow, Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu's visit to the Soviet Union has lasted for many days.

<p>Ankara, Turkish Prime Minister Saydam addressed members of parliament of the People's Republican Party today, announcing that the Soviet-Turkish negotiations in Moscow had broken down. It was stated that the talks did not produce a compromise because the new proposals made by the Soviet Union to Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu were incompatible with Turkey's promises to Britain and France. The guarantees offered by the Soviet Union to Turkey could not compensate for the obligations that the Soviet Union wanted Turkey to assume. Regarding the Tatar Strait, Turkey believes that it will not be bound by any other provisions other than those stipulated by its international covenants. Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is currently on his way back to the country. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Istanbul, after the breakdown of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations, it is reported that Turkey is preparing to conclude a mutual assistance treaty with Britain and France. According to a dispatch from Ankara, it is known in reliable circles in Ankara that this mutual assistance treaty can be signed before the end of this week. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London, well-informed sources stated that people here are satisfied with the remarks made by Turkish Prime Minister Saydam today regarding the breakdown of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. It is said that Saydam's remarks show that the Soviet Union attempted to persuade Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu to agree to block the Tatar Strait, even though, according to the Montreux Convention, Turkey is responsible for allowing the passage of naval tonnage equivalent only to the strength of the Soviet fleet, which the Soviet Union is still dissatisfied with. The opinion here is that Turkey's action clearly shows its determination to uphold the main war aim of the Allied countries, namely, respecting promised obligations. It is also believed that Turkey's decision will greatly enhance the peaceful outlook of the Balkans and Southern Europe. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London, the newspapers here have been commenting on the negotiations between Turkey and the Soviet Union. "The Times" stated, "Turkey's refusal to make more concessions to the Soviet Union may have a significant impact on the future of Soviet-German cooperation. If the Soviet Union can reach an agreement with Turkey to prohibit foreign warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits, it will certainly be calmer when considering the risk of joining the war." "The Daily Mail" stated that the fate of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations is the same as the negotiations previously conducted between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union regarding the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement. "The Soviet government apparently made various conditions last week, and it was even rumored that everything had been resolved. In short, after consulting with Britain and France, Turkey had accepted Stalin's views and revised the various provisions of the British-Turkish and French-Turkish agreements. Unexpectedly, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov wanted to gain even greater benefits, so the Turkish government resolutely rejected them." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Moscow, regarding the negotiations between Turkey and the Soviet Union, well-informed sources here stated that since Turkey began negotiations with the Soviet Union on September 25, it has had to decide between the two Allied countries, Britain and France, and the Soviet Union, a difficult problem that is difficult to answer. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu decided to return to his country yesterday to submit a report to the government in person. Therefore, the Soviet-Turkish negotiations have only been temporarily suspended, but not broken down. The Soviet Union's intention is to get Turkey to break away from Britain and France. Although this attempt is beneficial to Germany, in reality, the Soviet Union is still planning for itself. In short, it wants to control the Turkish port of Istanbul and thus control the Dardanelles Strait to realize the ambitions of Peter the Great. However, Turkey itself is quite powerful, and it maintains ties with Britain and France and has the backing of the three Allied countries of Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq (Turkey has signed the Near East Pact with these countries). The Soviet Union cannot apply the same tactics to Turkey as it does to the small countries along the Baltic Sea. As for the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland, although it is not directly related to the Soviet-Turkish negotiations, Finland, influenced by Turkey's attitude, is also resisting the demands made by the Soviet Union. What happens to Finland in the future will depend on the following three points: first, whether Finland's own attitude is resolute; second, whether the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula can provide Finland with assistance; and third, how strong the resistance that Turkey is putting on the Soviet Union is.

<p>Washington: Regarding the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, President Roosevelt, in a personal capacity, sent a telegram to Mikhail Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, on the 12th of this month, stating: "The United States initially does not wish to interfere in the negotiations being conducted by European countries, but there is one thing I would like to bring to your attention, which is that the United States has a deep and long-standing friendship with Finland. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the demands made by your country to Finland will not infringe upon the country's independent sovereignty and hinder the friendly and peaceful relations between your country and Finland. I recall that when the United States and the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations a few years ago, I worked together with you, and I cannot forget it to this day. Therefore, I take the liberty of sending this telegram." Kalinin recently replied to President Roosevelt, stating: "I have read your telegram with great gratitude. Our government recognized the independent sovereignty of the Republic of Finland on December 6, 1917, and concluded a treaty of friendship with it on October 14, 1920, to protect it. The fundamental principles on which Soviet-Finnish relations are based can be seen in these two facts. The current negotiations are also guided by these principles. The information issued in certain quarters is mostly fabricated and has an ulterior motive and cannot be believed. It should be known that the sole goal of these negotiations is to consolidate the current relations between the two sides, strengthen friendly cooperation, and thereby guarantee the security of both sides.

<h3 id="e29">The British Government Publishes the Final Report on British-German Negotiations; Hitler Was Surrounded by Extremists, and Göring's Proposals Were Ultimately Not Adopted <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>London: The British government has recently published a white paper containing the final report of former Ambassador to Berlin Henderson on his negotiations in Germany. This allows a glimpse into Hitler's personality, psychology, and policies. In this report, Henderson speaks of the events of August 30 and 31, saying that German Air Force Minister Göring was willing to resolve the matter peacefully, but everything depended on Hitler's personal decision. Hitler was surrounded by sycophants and encouraged by extremists, even more so than when he advanced into Czechoslovakia. From Hitler's personal perspective and the ambitions of those around him, war was the most agreeable outcome. If Hitler knew that he would face a bloody battle rather than a bloodless victory, he might not have taken this action. One of Hitler's greatest weaknesses was that he had never set foot abroad except for two trips to Italy, so his understanding of British psychology was entirely derived from his Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Ribbentrop's advice was often false, but he was perceptive in other aspects, so Hitler deeply believed in him and regarded him as a second Bismarck, and Ribbentrop also considered himself a second Bismarck. Although the extremely autocratic Hitler was not immune to the influence of his environment, all decisions, calculations, and opportunism were made by Hitler himself. Göring once told him that the head of state alone made the major decisions. After the German army's occupation of Prague violated Prime Minister Chamberlain's promise, British and world public opinion was in an uproar, and Hitler seemed surprised by this reaction. Moderate figures such as former Army Chief Brauchitsch, former Foreign Minister Neurath, and former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Fritsch were not favored by Hitler. Hitler had great faith in his army and air force and did not hesitate to use them against Poland. Hitler told the British ambassador that the war on the Eastern Front would be over in two months, and if Britain unwisely resisted his plan, Germany would deploy 160 divisions to the West. In the negotiations in the days before August 29, Hitler still expressed an attitude of friendship and cooperation, but after newspapers published news of the killing of six Germans by Poles on August 29, Hitler's attitude changed. The news of Poles killing Germans was likely fabricated by extremists, fearing that Hitler would back down. In his report, Henderson assessed Hitler's characteristics and psychology, saying that Hitler, like many Germans, both envied and resented the achievements of the British, and because Britain resisted Germany's excessive desires, he turned his envy and resentment into hatred. Hitler often referred to Britain as the representative of aristocratic politics and the most successful of the Nordic nations. Hitler had always wanted to exchange a treaty and guarantees with Britain for Britain's recognition of his grand plans, but his greatest mistake was that he completely misunderstood the inherent morality, humanity, and concepts of freedom of the British people.

<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain, in his weekly opinion on the war situation in the House of Commons today, said that Berlin had not expressed the German government's opinion on the war, which he was trying to clarify. Last week, he had replied to Hitler's peace plan, and he could not add anything to what he had said at that time. He went on to say that German propaganda agencies were making every effort to distort the facts in order to make foreign commentaries on the German side's views appear slightly better. This was a futile effort, and almost all neutral countries, regardless of party affiliation, unanimously expressed their sympathy to the Allied governments. This fact was difficult to conceal. The war had caused inconvenience to non-belligerent countries, but it had clearly not obscured the fundamental issues. The resolution of these issues, whether beneficial or harmful, would affect the spiritual and material well-being of neutral countries no less than that of belligerent countries. On the Western Front, the British Expeditionary Force had reached an agreement with the French army on the assigned sector, and the divisions had occupied their positions. The senior French and British commanders had a complete understanding of everything. The British Expeditionary Force was now under the command of the French Commander-in-Chief, so the effect of unified command had been achieved in the initial stage of the war. This was one proof of harmony between the two sides, and another proof was that the two sides had agreed that French troops would also serve under the British Commander-in-Chief stationed in France. The Prime Minister went on to discuss the naval warfare, praising the efforts of the navy. He then said that the naval personnel had suffered serious losses while fulfilling their duties this week. The House of Commons would like to express its condolences to the members of the army, navy, and air force who died in defense of the country. In discussing the activities of German submarines, he said that the losses suffered by British ships entering and leaving various ports in the week ending October 17 were only 5/1000 of the total, which showed that the German submarines' efforts to damage British trade by attacks had failed. Enemy aircraft had begun to attack British fleet bases, but had failed to inflict significant damage on British ships. Air battles had taken place on the coast in the last two days, destroying eight enemy aircraft, while no British aircraft had been lost. Some enemy bombers may not have been able to return home. The enemy aircraft engaged in combat numbered less than thirty, and the losses were so heavy that they could not be considered light. We should not be foolishly complacent in the initial stages of this war, nor should we think that we will always be able to achieve the current victory. There will be many surprising news in the war, not all of which will be pleasant, but such results at the beginning are at least satisfactory. The Prime Minister also praised the Royal Air Force for its courageous operations in his speech. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

It is reported that the submarine that destroyed the "Royal Oak" arrived at its base at 9:00 am yesterday, and German Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder personally welcomed it. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The submarine that sank the British battleship "Royal Oak" and damaged the British cruiser "Repulse" returned to a German port yesterday. Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder and many officers welcomed them at the port. On behalf of Führer Hitler, the entire navy and the people of the country, Admiral Raeder expressed his gratitude to the officers and men of the submarine for their achievements. The submarine commander, Prien, immediately reported on the sinking of the British "Royal Oak," saying that when the submarine sailed into Scapa Flow, it caught sight of two enemy warships, and he ordered the firing of torpedoes. In an instant, there was a loud explosion, and a high surge of water was seen in the distance. The farther one was hit by a torpedo and immediately burst into flames. Seconds later, the closer one was also hit by a torpedo. After the incident, the British immediately released black smoke to cover up the truth, but after the black smoke dispersed, looking at the scene of the incident, the farther one had disappeared without a trace, and the side of the closer one was submerged in the water. The ship had two funnels, which was probably the cruiser "Repulse." After completing its mission, the submarine sailed away from the bay at full speed. The bay was lit up with searchlights and radio codes were sent out. It was then heard that heavy objects were falling in the bay, probably because the navy in the bay still believed that the submarine was still in the bay and dropped explosives. The commander continued to say that the submarine was determined to sink the British battleship "Royal Oak" and the cruiser "Repulse" in one fell swoop, and that this achievement was entirely due to the concerted efforts of all the officers and men of the submarine. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

At that time, the torpedoes were continuously hitting the ship, four times in total, and the ship was tilting and gradually sinking.

<p>Washington: President Roosevelt announced yesterday the government's continued naval expansion plan and declared that he would request an increase of 10,000 personnel in the army, navy, and air force when Congress convenes its regular session in January. The President did not specify what kind of new ships would be added to the navy, but observers indicated that if Congress passes the President's proposal to increase the personnel of the army, navy, and air force, the U.S. Navy would be the largest since 1919. The President told reporters that the purpose of the current naval expansion program was to enable the United States to have a large navy in peacetime, but it would still not enable the country to have a complete fleet. The actual need of the United States was to expand and improve the navy to adapt to global naval standards. The President continued, "The naval problem cannot be solved by 'beautiful slogans' such as 'two ships exchanged for one ship' and 'two-ocean navy.'" He said that the so-called "complete fleet" itself must be affected by changing circumstances, so new plans must be made annually according to new circumstances. When Congress convenes its regular session in January, he will ask Congress to consider increasing funding for the army, navy, and Marine Corps, and to appropriate funds to改造 many destroyers from the First World War for "neutrality patrol" work.

<p>Singapore: According to an official announcement here, the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force is about to be ordered to mobilize. This volunteer force has several thousand merchants and civilians, so when the mobilization order is issued, efforts will be made to ensure that it does not affect the conduct of commerce and trade. According to Governor Thomas, this volunteer force occupies an extremely important position in the defense of Singapore, so that the British government does not have to transfer troops from the Western Front in Europe to here. Except for the officers, the volunteer air force has been temporarily allowed to return to their former occupations. The official has issued several announcements regarding defense exercises and asked the people not to lightly believe "rumors." The economic assistance of Malaya in this war can be seen in Sir Chiley's speech at the annual meeting of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce. He said that during this period we must transport as much tin and rubber and other goods as possible to Britain and its allies. Governor Thomas gave a detailed report on the defense of Singapore in a broadcast to the people of Malaya. The defense force stationed in India has been transferred to Singapore, and British defense forces have also arrived one after another. Thomas also said that the situation in Singapore is very good, as usual, and outsiders may not be able to detect that the British Empire is at war, but this small island is actually a nest of aircraft and is stationed with a large defense force. With the cooperation of the governments of the various colonies, British Malaya is planning to increase rice production. Malaya today requires two-thirds of its total rice from outside, mostly from Thailand, Burma, and Indochina. The government's new plan will encourage farmers to cultivate new land and pay them fees, and guarantee the minimum price of rice produced in the first three years. The Federal Malay Government has agreed that non-Malays can join in rice cultivation to relieve this emergency period. This can further increase rice production. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>

According to news from here, the reason for the detention of the various people is the manipulation of Chinese legal tender and "preparatory banknotes." It is reported that six Japanese bill merchants have also been arrested for this reason. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Various Fronts in Northern Jiangsu: Japanese Troops Retreating Towards Huai'an and Huaiyin; Impact of Japanese Defeat in Northern Hunan; Chinese Troops Have Recovered Baoying County; Puppet Troops Mutiny Upon Encountering Resistance <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: The war situation in northern Jiangsu has improved recently. Despite the Japanese troops' best efforts, they failed to break through the second line of defense of the Chinese troops. Their morale has plummeted. Furthermore, the great victory of the Chinese troops in northern Hunan has shaken the Japanese troops in various parts of central China. This has also had a related impact on the war situation in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the Japanese troops invading various fronts in northern Jiangsu underwent significant changes after the 3rd and 4th of this month. After a fierce counter-offensive by the Chinese troops, the Japanese began to retreat on the 5th. In places such as Caodian, Cuibao, Tatar Tou, Mayizhuang, Zhangjiazhen, Hongjiaqiao, Yangnianzhen, Jinghe, and Pingqiao, the Japanese troops encountered the brave counter-offensive of the Chinese XXX Army on the 5th. After a fierce battle lasting a day and a night, the Japanese troops were defeated on the 6th. The Chinese troops successively recovered these places on the same day and pursued the retreating Japanese troops. By noon on the 7th, the Japanese troops north of Baoying and south of Pingqiao were completely cleared, and a large number of war trophies were seized and are being inventoried. As of 7:00 PM, the majority of the Japanese troops between Huaiyin and Baoying had retreated to the Huai'an and Huaiyin areas. The Chinese troops have restored their pre-war positions. The Japanese troops in the Gaoyou area are still stubbornly defending the county seat and positions such as Cheluo and Lujin. The Chinese troops have surrounded the Japanese troops on three sides. At dawn on the 7th, there were still localized fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese troops. The Japanese troops in the Rugao area launched another attack on the Chinese troops' positions at dawn on the 7th. After a fierce battle lasting three hours, the Japanese troops failed and retreated. Although Jiangba and Xuyi, west of Gaobao Lake, unfortunately fell on the 3rd, the XXX unit of the Chinese troops on that front had established contact with the local authorities on the 7th and transferred to a suitable location in XXX, preparing to wait for an opportunity to counter-attack.</p>
<p>Another report: The situation in northern Jiangsu has become increasingly stable recently. The Japanese troops, who fiercely attacked southern Huaiyin, suffered heavy casualties and a significant loss of morale after encountering separate counter-offensives by the Chinese troops. Therefore, they have been retreating to Huai'an and Huaiyin in recent days. Before leaving, they set fire to civilian houses and wantonly destroyed everything, showing that they dare not launch another offensive. On the 8th, the Chinese authorities frequently received telephone reports from the front, stating that after Baoying was recovered by the Chinese troops, the Japanese troops were pressed hard by the Chinese troops and retreated in haste. Therefore, they did not have time to burn civilian houses in the city. Currently, the Chinese troops have entered Baoying County, and many people have returned one after another. County Magistrate Liu Bairong has also arrived in the county to comfort the people. Huangpu, Jinghe, and Pingqiao were officially recovered on the 8th. The fires set by the Japanese troops were extinguished by the Chinese troops. After the Japanese troops in Caodian, Cuibao, and other places were defeated, the vanguard of the Chinese troops moved into various places, and the fires were also extinguished. It is estimated that thousands of civilian houses were burned, and the people suffered heavy losses. It is also learned that the Japanese troops were extremely undisciplined during this invasion and engaged in widespread rape and looting of the people who had not escaped the war zone. Furthermore, the puppet troops mixed in with the Japanese troops collapsed in disarray upon encountering fierce resistance from the Chinese troops. Therefore, the Japanese line of defense could not be consolidated. The Japanese troops' fighting spirit is also far inferior to what it once was. Their clothing is tattered, and they are in a state of decline. This retreat was extremely embarrassing. After the Chinese troops switched from defense to offense, their morale was boosted, creating glorious results. It is also learned that senior Chinese military officers have personally gone to the front to command and supervise the troops.</p>
<p>During this Japanese invasion of the Gaobao line, the Chinese troops from all directions resisted, braving arrows and shedding blood, and endured extreme hardship. The Jiangsu Provincial Mobilization Committee of the Lu-Su War Zone, in conjunction with various sectors, launched a comfort delegation to carry supplies and set off for the front. It is reported that the comfort delegation has been determined by the general team of Comfort and Self-Defense of the Chinese Women's Comforting and Self-Defense Association of Jiangsu Province, and representatives from various groups have been sent out in two teams to the front.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Japanese Troops in Suzhou: Extremely Weak Strength <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Setting Up Artillery Positions to Make a Show of Force</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Although there are troops such as the Kikawa, Tsuji, and Hirono units, as well as the military police, stationed in Suzhou, in reality, except for the Hirono unit, which is a division, all the others are independent combined brigades. In total, there are about 40,000 troops. Recently, the Ishikawa unit was transferred to central China for operations, so its number is now less than 30,000. These less than 30,000 Japanese troops are stationed in this area and in Yihe, Wuxi, Wujin, Changshu, Qian, Taicang, and other counties. Therefore, under these circumstances, the Japanese military strength in the middle section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is very weak. At the beginning of this month, the Japanese troops in various places were busy with minor adjustments, which made their strength even weaker. The Japanese troops remaining in Suzhou continue to move around every day, making a show of force. Currently, from the railway station to the starting point of the Suzhou-Changshu highway, barbed wire is erected along the way. In addition to installing a 3-inch flat-shooting gun at the Pingmen wharf of the former Changshu steamship, many concrete bunkers have been built nearby. Each bunker has a machine gun installed. There are often three to five Japanese soldiers patrolling in teams nearby. At night, people are prohibited from passing through. Their purpose is clearly to defend against attacks by the Chinese troops.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Lou, Qi, Feng, Lu, Xu, Pan, Jin, and Ping eight city gates of this city were occupied by the Japanese troops, each gate was assigned two or thirty soldiers to guard it. However, the Qian gate has not been opened because the Japanese troops are defending against attacks by Chinese mobile units. Recently, in order to revitalize the Japanese concession (established by the Treaty of Shimonoseki after the Sino-Japanese War of the Qing Dynasty), a new city gate has been opened at the site of the old Shemen gate. Workers have been hired to build it. Regarding the full authority over the opening and closing of the city gates, the Japanese troops have completely transferred it to the puppet organization for management starting on the 10th of this month. The Japanese troops only have five soldiers stationed at each city gate.</p>

<p>Qianjiawei is Also Disturbed</p>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: More than 500 Japanese troops from the Uchida unit in Songjiang, yesterday divided into five small motorboats, seven civilian boats, and five small steel cannons, invaded Jinshanwei, Zhangyan, and other places. They were met by Chinese troops, and the fighting lasted for a day. At the same time, Oinaka of the Japanese troops in Jinshan also led a team to attack Maoqiao at night but was repulsed. The Japanese troops then changed their strategy and attacked the position of Shen's Chinese troops in front of the Yamen in three routes. Two routes advanced along the Huanggu Canal from Baziqiao and Sanliqiao Dam. When they reached Qianjiawei, they were ambushed by Chinese troops from Langxia, and the Japanese troops also collapsed and retreated. The corpses left behind were all carried to Zhujing for cremation.</p>

It also stated that Yu Yunmen and Lu Jimin also invested 1,500 yuan, etc. After investigation, I have not invested in this bureau.

<h3 id="e49">Overview of National Higher Education Moral Education (1): Moral Education System Gradually Improving Towards Perfection <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Special Dispatch) The Ministry of Education recently prepared a detailed report by the responsible department on the standards of the moral education system in colleges and universities across the country, the implementation of the tutor system, and youth groups. Excerpts of the original text are as follows:</p>
<p>Moral education in our country's schools, except for middle and primary schools, which have specific regulations in the middle school regulations and primary school regulations, and where schools have moral education personnel dedicated to this task, there is no legal basis for moral education in colleges and universities. Most schools also do not have moral education personnel, so in the past, there was almost no moral education. Since the occurrence of several student movements, the government and educators have gradually realized the importance of moral education in colleges and universities. In 1930, the Executive Yuan issued an order to rectify the academic atmosphere, which the Ministry of Education forwarded to various schools for compliance. In the same year, the Second National Education Conference specifically proposed improving moral education in the resolution on the plan to improve higher education. It emphasized cultivating a sound character to serve the country and society based on the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation guidelines. In 1931, the 17th Standing Committee of the Third Central Executive Committee passed the "Principles for the Implementation of the Three People's Principles Education," which also included a special chapter on moral education. It stipulated nine items regarding moral education in colleges and universities, which the Ministry of Education ordered various schools to implement, ensuring that teachers guide students' self-study outside of teaching so that teachers and students can interact frequently to achieve the effect of personal influence. Some schools implemented it at the time, but it did not have a widespread effect. At the same time, it also issued a notice to colleges and universities across the country to submit their moral education policies and implementation details for review and approval as a reference for drafting moral education standards. In 1932, the Executive Yuan issued an order to rectify education, which also focused on the reorganization of moral education in schools. In 1932, it specifically issued the Measures for Military Management of Schools Above High School, aiming to cultivate students' cleanliness, agility, diligence, simplicity, endurance, unity, mutual assistance, vigorous spirit, and obedience to discipline. Students' daily lives were subject to military management. In recent years, it has become increasingly urgent to promote moral education in colleges and universities. Therefore, in February 1938, the Outline for Youth Training was promulgated as a guideline for moral education in schools. In April of the same year, a Moral Education Research Committee was established to study and promote practical issues of moral education in schools at all levels and social education. The Outline for the Tutor System in Secondary and Higher Schools was also promulgated, and guidelines for implementing the tutor system were given. Schools established directors of tutors and tutors to guide students in groups. Newly established schools even set up moral education departments to be specifically responsible for moral education. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect the moral education affairs of various schools at any time to facilitate improvement. As a result, the moral education system in colleges and universities has gradually become perfect.</p>

Every Wednesday and Sunday afternoon from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, Cao Tianxiu, the former general director of the United Choir of Middle Schools in Peiping, will be specially invited to teach famous moral education songs and basic music knowledge, so that young people can know the greatness of moral education songs.

<p>Scheduled to Open on November 1st</p>
<p>(Jinhua News) In order to increase public knowledge, the Zhejiang Provincial Library has established a branch library of the Zhejiang Provincial Library in the Tianhou Palace in Lishui County, the transportation center.

At the same time, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education provides financial assistance from the education budget. It is now in the final stages of preparation and is scheduled to open on November 1st. Because Lishui is not only the transportation center of eastern Zhejiang but also the education center, as most colleges are located in Bihu Town in Lishui, it not only increases people's knowledge but also provides a lot of convenience for young students to learn.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Seventh Session of Government-Funded Students Studying in the UK: To Go Abroad in Autumn Next Year <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Eighth Session to be Held in Two Years</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund selected 24 government-funded students to study in the UK this year. They originally planned to gather in Hong Kong on September 16 to take a ship to go abroad. However, due to the outbreak of the European War, and the war declared by Britain and France against Germany, problems arose in transportation and safety. The departure was temporarily postponed. Since the European War is likely to be prolonged, the departure date is difficult to determine. Therefore, all the selected students have been notified to suspend dispatch this year. According to the Shanghai office of the association, it has been decided that the 24 government-funded students selected this year will depart in the autumn of next year after the European situation may have stabilized. The eighth session of recruitment will be postponed to two years later.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Finance Currency Market Quiet, Exporters Slightly Offer, Resulting in US Dollar Stable, British Pound Slightly Tight <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The unofficial market for US dollars against British pounds was generally stable. The opening saw overseas US dollar to British pound exchange rate continuing to extend to 875, reaching the four yuan mark, hence the British pound tightened by 0.015625, reaching four shillings and five pence, 78125. The US dollar remained unchanged. Subsequently, due to the Hong Kong Electric, Chinese banks, and exporters offering, the market once hardened to British gold at four pence six and a quarter. US dollar foreign exchange once traded at 7.6875. However, HSBC's intentions to buy rose, and sellers suddenly became scarce, causing the market to soften. The US dollar tightened to 7.5625, and British gold to four pence five and a quarter. Extending to the noon closing, British gold remained at four pence five and a quarter, and the US dollar at 7.625, both seeking shared fortunes and misfortunes. The process was exceptionally dull. The futures trend mirrored the spot market, with extremely few inquiries. The foreign exchange future has become an easy-to-loosen and difficult-to-tighten trend, likely due to the escalating tensions on the Western Front in Europe, which are not unrelated. Half-day trading was quiet.</p>
<p>US Dollar to British Pound Exchange Rate Reaches Four Yuan</p>
<p>Early morning saw London's large contracts recently shortening by 1875, and deferred contracts decreasing by 4375. The New York silver price fell by one cent, and London's gold remained stagnant. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai yuan, French francs, etc., were offered at par. The US dollar lengthened by 875 against the British pound, reaching four yuan, and increased by five cents against the Shanghai yuan, and decreased by a small eight and three quarters against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of British gold at four pence five and a quarter, and US dollar at 7.625, compared to the previous closing, the British pound slightly tightened by 0.015625, and the US dollar remained unchanged, due to the increase in exchange rates. After opening, the first telegram from Hong Kong offered, and Chinese banks and exporters also slightly offered. Therefore, the market was stable with a tendency to harden. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric, Chinese banks, and exporters sold spot British gold to HSBC, favorably and to certain American banks at five shillings and nine and three-quarters and six and a quarter pence, and spot US dollar at 7.65625. At the same time, a certain bank absorbed spot US dollar at 7.6875 from other banks. HSBC's listed prices were announced as unchanged, and the announcement of the silver equalization tax also showed no rise or fall. Thereafter, sellers gradually decreased, and foreign banks' appetite increased, causing the situation to soften to four pence five and a quarter and 7.5625. At noon, the situation turned flat. Extending to the noon closing, banks' spot selling prices were British gold at four pence five and a quarter, and US dollar at 7.625, the same as the previous price for this month. November's British gold was four pence five and a quarter, and US dollar at 7.5 yuan. As a result, the average spot British pound tightened slightly by 0.015625 compared to the previous day, while the US dollar showed no difference. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Spot and Futures Both Loose</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 18th Telegram: The currency market opened flat this morning. Spot and futures for the British pound were unchanged, still at one shilling and three pence. Spot for the US dollar loosened by 0625, reaching 2.5 yuan. Futures were unchanged, still at 24.8125 yuan. Shanghai yuan spot decreased by one yuan, reaching 323 yuan. Japanese yen was unchanged, still at 106.5 yuan. At 11:30, it was stable. US dollar spot was unchanged, and futures loosened by 0625, reaching 24.875 yuan. The rest was stable.

Spot for the US dollar lengthened by 125, reaching 6.6875 yuan. Shanghai yuan decreased by one yuan, reaching 115 yuan. "Lianchao" notes in the unofficial market were cheap by half a yuan, reaching 86 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Gold Market Mediocre <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash "Ha Chi" unofficial market situation: first low, then high, and finally returning to par, forming a mountain shape. The process can be described as mediocre. Initially, due to the hardening of foreign exchange and the lack of "Ke Bang" (visiting merchants) coming to buy, it opened at 4,000 yuan. Further aggravated by the fierce buying by money changers, it once plunged into the 4,000 yuan mark, reaching 3,998 yuan. Later, hearing that foreign exchange had softened, retail investors suddenly entered the market to search and buy. Hong Kong banks vigorously purchased afterward, slowly pushing the price back to a high of 4,014 yuan. Subsequently, it hovered around 4,010 yuan. Until the afternoon, when money changers again sold, it once retreated to 4,006 yuan, but securities firms bought in slightly, resulting in a return to par at 4,010 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, due to the lack of foreign exchange market on Wednesday, the market closed early at 3:00 PM. Overall trading was still strong, with a volume of about 1,000 taels. Gold ornaments in silver shops remained unchanged, and customs gold remained at par.</p>
<p>"Ha Chi" Unclear Fortunes</p>
<p>Since morning, each bar (ten taels) initially had weak demand, and there were many sellers. A certain money changer was even more eager to sell. The opening price was suppressed by a small ten yuan. A certain money changer sold 20 taels to a colleague, priced at 4,000 yuan. Instantly, it was suppressed by another two yuan. A certain money changer sold another 30 taels to a gold shop, priced at 3,998 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms absorbed at low prices, and retail investors also followed slightly. Soon it returned to a high of twelve yuan. A securities firm bought 10 taels from a money changer, priced at 4,010 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly started selling, and silver shops also sold off dozens of taels, gradually decreasing by five yuan. A certain gold shop sold 20 taels to a silver shop, priced at 4,005 yuan. Soon after hearing that foreign exchange had softened slightly, buyers came to push up the price. Before long, it returned to the 4,010 yuan mark. However, at that time, a securities firm suddenly acted on behalf of Hong Kong banks, vigorously absorbing more than 300 taels, causing the price to rise again to 4,014 yuan, all supplied by silver shops and gold shops. Nearing noon, the securities firm suddenly stopped buying and instead sold off, resulting in a decrease of a small four yuan. Money changers mutually traded 20 taels, priced at 4,010 yuan. Later, they raised it by another two yuan. A money changer bought 10 taels from a securities firm, priced at 4,012 yuan as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, because a certain money changer suddenly had the intention to sell, the opening price was suppressed by four yuan. A certain money changer sold 10 taels to a gold shop, priced at 4,008 yuan. Later, they vigorously sold off dozens of taels, causing it to fall again by two yuan. A certain money changer sold 30 taels to a colleague, priced at 4,006 yuan. After entering, a certain securities firm came to buy, and sellers were observing and not advancing, resulting in a rebound of four yuan. A certain securities firm bought 20 taels from a gold shop, priced at 4,010 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it was unclear whether it rose or fell compared to the previous day. There were sixteen yuan of ups and downs throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand of gold was ten yuan higher than "Ha Chi". Buying back required a deduction of about thirty yuan. The current bid gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and transactions were rare.</p>
<p>No Change in Ornaments</p>
<p>The exchange price per tael of jewelry gold in silver shops remained unchanged from day to day due to the stagnant ups and downs of "Ha Chi." The large "Datongxing" shop still hung at 405 yuan. The new "Tongxing" shop had the same price as before, and buying back required a reduction of about twenty yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for unified public bonds: with depressing news from all sides, the market atmosphere suddenly turned quiet. And the peaceful atmosphere of the past few days had dissipated, and the bullish camp seemed to be shaken and no longer active. Therefore, the market atmosphere was quiet, and prices gradually declined during the meandering. When trading opened in the morning, the market price was stable at first, and then presented a high disk because Lianyi Dafeng successively collected vigorously, and then Suikang alone purchased Type E. Then, Russian Tiansheng Datong and retail investors successively supplied and sold, and the seekers turned rare, and the market atmosphere was weakly supported, and the father softened. The afternoon trend was still sluggish, and Songmao and Yongxiang began to sell off. Only Yongkang and Houda slightly accepted the purchase, resulting in a continued decline in the market price. As a result of the whole-day rivalry, they all fell back from one corner to three corners, and the transaction was called ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Fifty shares of Ning Shao Steamship shares were traded, priced at eight yuan.</p>
<p>Moreover, yesterday's stock market in the Public Works Bureau was generally interesting and did not see any reduction. The brokers were very busy due to the crowding of entrustments, but there was no sudden disturbance. The price maintenance was also good. Huidefeng shares returned to the previous day's high of 62 yuan, and Yesu Shipyard shares saw a new high price of 176.5 yuan. The Telephone Company shares continued to advance to 18 yuan. If the silver roots are long and loose, and the major households still want to carefully maintain the market, it is also very easy to support the price without falling. However, if the profit-making bulls suddenly emerge in large quantities, or the foreign exchange market, which is sufficient to reuse excellent remuneration funds, then the situation will suddenly turn against them, and it is not known whether investors or speculators will regret their current actions beyond their ability.</p>
<p>London, 17th Telegram: Today's listing market for British businessmen's distant bundle companies' stocks was generally calm, with only the Megalith Bank shares rising by two shillings and six pence, priced at seven pounds two shillings and six pence, and the rest remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 17th Telegram: Today's listing market for foreign prices in China has returned to calm, and there is no change in the market conditions of the upper and lower bonds.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Yarn and Cotton Foreign Yarn Prices Cheaper Than Shanghai, Sales to Customers Therefore Hopeless <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a state of fatigue, and the downward trend is gradually intensifying, which is really due to the weakness of yarn sales, the loosening of factory roots, and the increasing number of spot chips. The foundation of the yarn market is not strong. As for general speculators, in view of the stability of foreign exchange, and the decline in the market price of all commodities, their interest is waning. Another saying is that the price of yarn in foreign ports is cheaper than that in Shanghai. Not only can transportation not make a profit, but it will also lose money. Therefore, the ability to purchase has been greatly reduced. In short, unless the actual demand improves, the market may not appear in a new posture.</p>
<p>The opening of the current yarn market in the morning still cannot get rid of the fatigue. Although many parties want to shout high, there is a real lack of buyers. All the transactions belong to the flow of snatching the limelight. The market is not strong, and the opening price of Shuangma spot is 709 yuan, and soon it will reach 711 yuan. The stack unit price has been delayed for a long time, and the opening price is 695 yuan. Soon after hearing that the factory has the intention to open a large amount of sales, it is currently under negotiation, and people's hearts are slowly loosening. Gradually, the closing Shuangma fell to 700 yuan, and the stack unit price was 692 yuan. It is found that 1,340 packages were traded in half a day, and the market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 9 yuan, Tiannv fell by 2 yuan, and Shuangdiqiu fell by 2 yuan. Today, 2,385 pieces of yarn were transported to Tianjin. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left,</p>
<p>Fellow traders 790 Hong Kong 385</p>
<p>Quanzhou 10 Jiangxi 50</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Mainland 95</p>
<p>Statistics 1,340</p>
<p>Also, it was once rumored in yesterday's market that Shenxin No. 9 Factory would open a price of 700 yuan for 20-count Shuangma yarn, and a certain yarn number had opened 500 packages. The common yarn number still thought this price was too expensive and did not intend to accept it, and the asking price was within the 700 yuan mark. As a result, it did not open. Judging from the general trend, it is currently under separate negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e64">This Cotton Mill Suspends Business, Fellow Traders Start Ordering American Cotton <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The transaction of this cotton has greatly decreased, which is due to the step-by-step decline of the yarn market, and the various factories have no intention to replenish. The transaction has turned silent. Chinese and foreign factories have only not handled the package, only fellow traders have entered 1,000 packages of Tongzhou cotton, priced at 135 yuan to 137 yuan, delivered by bank notes, with the source of northern Jiangsu, and 1,540 pills of Tongzhou cotton, and 5,170 packages from Beisha.</p>
<p>Another news, the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday was quite prosperous because of the firmness of the New York cotton market. Although the factory still holds a hope, fellow traders have already started to order American cotton. Although the number is very huge, the opening is the number of 1,000 packages. This American cotton can be used for spinning 20 counts. According to the current exchange rate, the factory price is only 170 yuan, which is much higher than the high-grade Tongzhou in terms of grade.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price, New York cotton market, was very firm in the early morning, and the telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai were all good. Speculators bought very actively, and the textile industry also had a healthy appetite due to the sales of cloth. It also rose due to the purchase of fellow traders and the firmness of the stock market on Wall Street. As a result, compared with the previous day's price, the cotton price rose by eight to ten pounds. The Indian even forecast a rise of two rupees, the Egyptian fell by five or six pounds, and the Liverpool rose by a penny.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Grain Grain Prices Difficult to Stabilize, Many Culprits <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, all sources only transported about 3,000 packages of new goods from Jiangsu, Kun, Qing, Jia, and other raw packages by wheels. There was a shortage of goods outside the river. Because of the few arrivals, people's hearts were strong, and there were rumors in the market that there was a shortage of rice for a while, which was the old habit of a certain party, specializing in intercepting us. The reason why a certain party intercepted was precisely because its internal unification was not uniform. The travel permit issued by Party A was not recognized by Party B, and the travel permit of Party B was not recognized by Party C. Secondly, it wanted to use the power of detention to carry out its squeeze. Thirdly, it wanted to use war to support war and secretly wanted to make a fortune from rice and grain. Fourth, Japan lacks tenant farmers, fertilizer is expensive, and there is a shortage of 17 million to 20 million stones of rice, and it is not without a part that wants to take it from China. It allows its southern gang rice, which is coveted by them. Although the quality of Chinese rice is not as good as Japanese rice, at the time of food shortage, it also wants to dye its fingers. Sixthly, Tianjin has banned grain exports. With this kind of local speculative elements, they took advantage of the opportunity to make a big splash. They did not know that the major rice-producing areas were still controlled by the Chinese guerrillas, and the rice and grain that Japan could control and control was only limited to the occupied areas. Therefore, the harm to Chinese food was minimal. The rice merchants and hoarders took advantage of the fire to rob and competed to take the lead. In a short time, the situation was unusually barren, and the general customers all regarded it as a rare commodity, and made it at random, and the shouting was high. In the Central City, the general hoarders, who had been absent for a long time, were even more sensationalized. The market price of each commodity has been shouted up by more than two yuan. Until the noon market, the price of each commodity was too high, and the general prudent people's minds did not see any slight despair, so they all stood by and watched the wind, and then borrowed to seek the strategy of advance and retreat in order to control the victory, so the zero and lump stomachs were weakened again, so the closing market price of each commodity was not as good as the shouting. The price was too high, and it was also more varied. As a result of the broken price, it added up to about one yuan. The Changbang special broke 33 yuan, Wuxi special broke 32 yuan, Gao 31 yuan, Central City 30 yuan, Jue 28 yuan, and Su Tong broke 28 yuan to 26 yuan. The various new japonica and the variety of Bai Ge were less than the market goods, allowing a price of one yuan and forty-five cents or more. If Changzhou's new japonica special is 30 yuan, the market is 29 yuan, and Kunsu's new japonica is 29 yuan to 26 yuan, Jue is about 25 yuan, and Qingjiao's variety opens at 31 yuan, Fengjing's special Bai Ge is 3 yuan and 2 cents, and Jiashan's market goods are 28 yuan and 9 yuan, and the situation is similar to that of new japonica. Although the shouting of Yanglu tip and the general customer tip was also fierce in the early market, it was difficult to keep pace with the rising wind of the japonica market because the market goods were more abundant, so the closing price of each was about half a yuan to one yuan higher than the previous market. If Nanjing No. 1 tip is 10 yuan and 5 cents, No. 2 tip is 20 yuan and 1 or 2 cents, 20 yuan, No. 3 tip is 19 yuan and a half, Wuhu special tip is 20 yuan and 4 or 5 cents, the market is 20 yuan, the middle is 19 yuan and 7 cents, 19 yuan and a half, Jue is 19 yuan, 18 yuan and 8 cents, Shi tip is 18 yuan, 17 yuan and a half, Jiangbei tip is 20 yuan and 19 yuan and 7 cents, and Changxi Suku Fengjia and other special sheep tips are 23 yuan and a half to 22 yuan, and the special reed tips are 24 yuan and 2 cents to 22 yuan and a half. Although the road to the old and new variants is not as wide as that of the japonica tip, the market price is also brought up by half a yuan to one yuan, Chen Wu is 31 or 2 yuan, Xin Yuan is 26 or 7 yuan, and the total market transaction volume is not less than 15,000 or 6,000 packages.</p>
<p>The customer Xian rose very sharply in the market yesterday. The reason is that after the tragic fall a few days ago, the transporters from Jiangbei and other places have stopped, so the arrivals at the end of the day have been sparse. Although the price has risen to transport, the issue of obtaining a purchase certificate has not been resolved, and the transporters have not dared to handle it with pleasure. Yesterday, the supply in the market was sharply reduced, and in addition to the zero households in the local street and village, there were also inland gangs absorbing in the market, so the high-grade Xian has risen to about 21 yuan, which is half a yuan to one yuan higher than the previous market.</p>
<p>Flour Yesterday's spot transaction was slightly active. Both the North and South Gangs had sporadic embellishments. The local street wholesale also ate the stack list goods into the stomach, but it was also lacking a floating deposit. The market was stable on the ground, and the cost was increasing day by day as the wheat price was rising. It was heard that the pipe shop wheat had reached 10 yuan, 5 cents and 8 points, and people's hearts were looking forward to it. The red and blue cart stack list rose to 7 yuan and 3 corners, and the warship also needed more than 7 yuan and 2 corners. The factory disk still stood at 7 yuan and 2 corners on the original disk, and was temporarily unwilling to open more, so the market may continue to rise. Today, 16,280 packages of flour were transported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market trend was gradually rising. The recent arrivals are not many, and the sellers are holding on to it, but the factory's stomach is average, and the market has not been able to pass well for a while. The total market was jointly handled by Fuxin and Fufeng factories, with about 600 to 700 packages of Changxi and other wheat, priced at 10 yuan, 1 corner and 2 points, and the hoarders entered a car of pipe shop wheat, priced at 10 yuan, 5 corners and 8 points, and rose several points to nearly a corner.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Silk and Tea Japanese Silk Rises Madly 125 Yuan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>New York Consumption Expected to Improve Factory Through 4,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's domestic and foreign silk markets rose sharply. Yokohama spot jumped madly by 125 yuan, deferred rose by 114 yuan, New York spot Japanese silk 83.75 cents each rose by 5 cents, Shanghai silk rose by 5 cents, recent standard silk rose by 1 corner, and deferred rose by 8 cents. The brewing rise in the past ten days has already created a record high yesterday. Looking at the reasons, it is probably caused by the expected improvement in the sales of real silk in New York and the despair of peace in Europe. Therefore, the guiding force of the current market price, which is so high, should be more speculative.</p>
<p>Yesterday's local silk market also rose sharply with it. The white factory rose by 78 yuan and 100 yuan, and the collected miles rose by 60 yuan, totaling 150 dan. As of the afternoon, the price held by silk merchants had risen to 4,500 yuan for the white factory. If the silk sales were not sold, it would be dwarfed in comparison. In recent days, there has been very little news, and there has been no development yet.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Sugar Market Dutch Sugar Soars <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Cart White Follows Up... State Sugar Plummets</p>
<p>According to Dutch telecommunications yesterday, the production price of foreign sugar suddenly rose by 1 yuan and 9 corners, and the price of crude white has reached Dutch shield 12.30, so the association's drawing disk is becoming more and more tense. 24 crude white also rose by 2 yuan and a half to 3 yuan and a half. Our station rose from 56 yuan and a half to 57 yuan and a half. Foreign stations were 57 yuan and a half to 58 yuan, and even reached 59 yuan. Transit goods were 45 or 6 yuan to 46 yuan and 8 corners. Taikoo cart white rose by 2 yuan and a half. B Mike rose from 61 yuan to 62 yuan, CW Mike 60 yuan, CX Mike 60 yuan, DY Mike 58 yuan and a half, HX Mike 58 yuan, H Mike was 41 yuan and a half to 1 yuan and 8 corners, and later reached 42 yuan and a half, and Dutch red was 43 yuan, 1 corner to 3 yuan and a half. This cotton white rose by 3 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was 59 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3 and 4 were returned according to the previous price. The original ice rose by 2 yuan and a cow, No. 1 was 70 yuan, and Pin Ming ice was 71 yuan and a half. A tide gang opened out Shanbai powder for state sugar for 53 or 4 yuan to 52 yuan, and Huanggang Qing even entered the 40 yuan mark, only 37 yuan and a half, and the decision was 37 yuan to 36 yuan, which was too far-fetched compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Miscellaneous Grains New Sesame Arrives <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>——Foreign Market's Destination Also Turns Active——</p>
<p>Recently, the source of new sesame has been quite prosperous. At present, the arrivals are around 4,000 yuan. In addition to the export from this street, the sales market also makes a net purchase by foreign markets, which has also become active. (The foreign market's net goods were once opened at 50 tons, priced at 44 yuan), so although the market has softened due to many arrivals, the potential is clear. Yesterday, it was calculated that 200 packages of Yangzhou sesame were traded, priced at 28 yuan, 40 packages of Wuhu sesame were 30 yuan and 2 corners, and 39 packages of Benniu sesame were 26 yuan and 7 corners. The overall situation of soybeans and broad beans is mediocre, and there have been no major changes.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Hardware Market Disk Soars <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Starting yesterday, hardware companies suddenly refused to sell again, and foreign firms also set high prices. The reason is that Germany wants to blockade the sea, and the transportation is hindered by the harassment, and the standards are high. For example, this nail has risen from 46 yuan to 55 yuan, the black iron billet 2,000 pounds has risen from 900 yuan to 1,000 yuan, the black iron billet 200 pounds has risen from 85 yuan to 90 yuan, the company iron has returned from 160 yuan to 170 yuan, the white lead skin has risen from 770 yuan to 800 yuan, the white lead wire has risen from 50 yuan to 60 yuan, the new lead wire has risen from 90 yuan to 110 yuan, the yellow steel wire has risen from 45 yuan to 50 yuan, the flat iron has risen from 40 yuan to 45 yuan, the bamboo steel bar has risen from 750 yuan to 800 yuan, the 20th called the large tinplate has risen from 900 yuan to 1,000 yuan again, the 26th 500 yuan, the front double-connected tinplate 100 pounds, the Italian goods are 230 yuan, the American goods are 240 yuan, the 90-pound double-connected Italian goods are 210 yuan, the American goods are 220 yuan, and the green lead company iron is 155 yuan, all of which have risen rather than fallen compared to before.</p>

<h3 id="e71">The Japanese and Puppets Occupy the Shelter, Even Expelling Refugees from Their Homes, The Scene of More Than 400 People Sleeping in the Open is Miserable, Puppet Police on Yu Yuan Road Increased Again Yesterday <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>No. 11, Jiezhu Road, Ji Si Fei Er Road, was originally the club of Hanyeping Coal Mine Company. After the "August 13" incident, it was borrowed by the Cilian Branch to set up the 31st Refugee Shelter. On the afternoon of September 9, it was suddenly invaded by the Japanese and puppet troops and police, occupying the office of the staff downstairs and two large refugee dormitories, and piling up sandbags at the entrance to set up a guard post. A part of the open space in the shelter was also surrounded by iron barbed wire. The refugee shelter and the Nantong Middle School opened another door for entry and exit. Afterwards, the Japanese and puppets continued to occupy two flat houses and opened them as kitchens. However, they usually treated the refugees kindly.</p>
<p>House Word Notice Setting Up a Puppet Tax Bureau</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on the 1st of this month, the place received a notice from the owner of the house, roughly stating that the house had been transferred to a puppet organization to set up a Unified Tax Bureau, and all of them were required to move out within 15 days. We then expelled them. The refugees were all afraid and apprehensive when they heard the news, and they suddenly showed an uneasy situation. The place had reported the situation to the Cilian Branch, but there was no result so far. Extending to about 2:00 pm the day before yesterday, a Japanese soldier suddenly led more than a dozen puppet policemen and forcibly drove out more than 100 refugees upstairs. Those who disobeyed were whipped on the spot. The refugees were unable to resist, so they had to support the old and carry the young, carrying boxes and baskets, and moved to the outdoor open space to take temporary shelter. It was deep autumn and heavy dew, and they slept in the cold night, and the scene was extremely miserable.</p>
<p>Continue Yesterday to Expel Refugees</p>
<p>Yesterday, the puppet police continued to drive out all the refugees downstairs, and used wooden strips to nail off the doors and windows. It was found that the place originally accommodated more than 650 refugees. After suffering this misfortune yesterday, those who had a little livelihood have left the place one after another. There are still more than 400 people gathering in the open air, but the Japanese and puppet side also limited them to moving out last night. It is heard that Liu Yi, the director of the place, has avoided going to the office after the unfortunate incident occurred. The refugees have repeatedly sent representatives to the Cilian Branch to state their tragic situation and request relief, but there is no result. It is deeply hoped that those who handle charity affairs will be able to do their best in the end.</p>
<p>Increase the Puppet Police Armed Patrolling On Yu Yuan Road, Since a certain agency was established, the Japanese and puppet special agents have long been densely guarded, which is extremely strict. Every intersection has puppet police posts and puppet police directing traffic. Unexpectedly, suddenly starting at 9:00 am yesterday, several small teams of puppet police suddenly increased on the road, and all of them carried guns and armed patrolling back and forth. Each team was divided into six people. The situation was tense and the intention was unclear. It was then learned from the relevant parties that the Japanese and puppet side, because of the assassination of Cheng Haitao, the secretary of the political department of the French Concession police station, also made special preparations for the area along the road where a certain agency is located.</p>
<p>The Puppet Side Sends Personnel to Investigate the Household Registration</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Puppet Police Bureau of West Shanghai sent the puppet officials of the household registration office, each leading two armed puppet police officers, and went to the civic houses in the Da Xi Road area to investigate the population door by door, and inquired in detail about the monthly rent of each house and recorded it in the book. The intention was to prepare to collect the house donation according to the amount of rent of each household. As for other roads, alleys and lanes, they will also carry out the investigation procedures one by one. Once the hand is completed, they will report to the puppet Finance Bureau to start collecting donations. However, the shops and residents in West Shanghai are deeply aware of the righteousness and are determined to resist the puppet side's levy of donations.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Yesterday Morning - Clear Cannon Fire <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>From eight o'clock to twelve o'clock yesterday morning, intermittent cannon fire could be heard from the southwestern part of this city. There were more than twenty rounds in total. In the quiet rural areas around Pudong, the sound was quite clear. It is estimated that the location of the cannon fire was twenty to thirty li away from Shanghai, seemingly between Xinlonghua and Minhang. That area is where the Chinese guerrilla forces are active, and they have now joined with the guerrilla forces between Songjiang and Qingpu, posing a significant threat to the Japanese forces in the suburbs of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e73">French Concession Chief Inspector Cheng Haitao Assassinated - Shot Dead on Route Cardinal Mercier Yesterday Morning - Rickshaw Puller Also Injured by Stray Bullet <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Haitao, the acting Chinese chief inspector of the political affairs department of the French Concession police, was suddenly assassinated by several thugs who opened fire on him en route yesterday morning around seven o'clock. The detailed information obtained is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Taking a Rickshaw to the Police Station</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at seven o'clock, Cheng got up, ate a bowl of white fungus for breakfast, and took six capsules of cod liver oil. Dressed in a coffee-colored suit, wearing a coffee-colored felt hat, and carrying a pistol, he went to the police station to work. He walked from his residence to the entrance of Hengchang Lane. Because Cheng was usually frugal and did not have vehicles for transportation, he hailed a rickshaw pulled by Gao Xuewen (35 years old, from Jiangbei, residing at No. 3, Lane 780, Route Père Robert), rickshaw number 大照一七一二, 小照七二八九, and sat in it. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw turned into the entrance of Route Cardinal Mercier and headed west, thugs who had been following behind attacked, resulting in the bloodshed.</p>
<p>Thug Attack - Three Shots in the Body</p>
<p>When Cheng's rickshaw reached the entrance of Kangdi Electric Pole Factory at No. 309 Route Cardinal Mercier, four thugs suddenly appeared. Two of them stepped forward to hold the rickshaw canopy and called out, "Mr. Cheng." The rickshaw slowed down slightly. In that instant, one of them pulled out a gun and fired four shots. Because of the close distance, three bullets hit Cheng, in the back of the head, left shoulder, and back. The rickshaw puller, Gao Xuewen, was also hit by a stray bullet, which happened to graze the fleshy tumor on the back of his neck. Blood flowed like a torrent. Both men fell to the ground between No. 309 and No. 311, a halal sesame cake shop. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, scattered and fled without a trace. However, according to another report, a thug suddenly jumped out from behind Cheng's back, from beside a roadside electric pole, rushed to the back of Cheng's rickshaw, and fired four shots at the back of Cheng's head and back. The bullets hit the back of Cheng's head and spine. The rickshaw puller was still unaware and continued to pull the rickshaw forward, while a bullet to Cheng's head pierced his forehead and flew out, grazing the rickshaw puller's right shoulder. He stopped the rickshaw in front of No. 311 Route Cardinal Mercier. Cheng, due to the severity of his injuries, had already died. When the rickshaw stopped and the body fell, the assassin, seeing that his goal had been achieved, turned back and ran wildly eastward to escape.</p>
<p>Death En Route - Sent to Morgue for Examination</p>
<p>A few minutes after the bloodshed, patrol officers from nearby arrived. At the same time, the police station also received the tragic news and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct a major search. They also summoned an ambulance to transport Cheng into the vehicle, intending to take him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but Cheng died en route due to the severity of his injuries, before reaching the hospital. The police station then changed the destination to the Bureau of Public Works morgue on Route Télégraphe. The rickshaw puller, Gao Xuewen, was sent to the hospital for treatment. The police then summoned Cheng's family to the police station to inquire about the situation. Based on intelligence, they requested the First Special Court to send Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang to examine the body. After the examination, the body was released to the family for funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>Acting Chief Inspector - Only Six Months</p>
<p>Cheng was a native of Huizhou, 38 years old. His wife, Liu Shuzhen, was ill and had not yet recovered. They had three sons: Wanli, 18 years old, currently studying at Dagu Vocational School; Qianli (15 years old); and the youngest son, Baili (12 years old), both studying at Chongshi Primary School on Route Père Robert. Cheng also had an elderly father, Fusheng, now 64 years old, a younger brother, Zongtao (17 years old), and a younger sister, Huizhen (16 years old). The family's livelihood depended on his salary. Therefore, when the bad news reached his home, the cries of grief were unbearable. Cheng had been serving in the French Concession police for more than two years. He was originally a secretary and translator in the political affairs department. After the former Chief Inspector Cao Huasheng was killed on May 6 this year, the administration appointed Cheng to his current position because of his competence. Unexpectedly, he suffered a tragic death before serving six months.</p>
<p>No Prior Signs</p>
<p>Cheng's body was moved by his family to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Route Xujiahui yesterday afternoon, and a funeral committee was organized to select a date for the funeral. According to his brother-in-law, Mr. Liu, Cheng's sudden and tragic death came without any prior threatening letters. Therefore, Cheng himself did not take any precautions. The French Concession police are now under strict orders to apprehend the assassins. The recovered bullet casings have also been handed over to experts for examination.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Detailed Record of Current Ferry Routes After the Shanghai Municipal Ferry Was Seized - It is Incorrect that the Sunken Xin Taikoo No. 9 Was Formerly Ferry No. 6 <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Ferry, operated by the former Xingye Trust Company, had a total of six newly built, modern ferry boats, numbered 1 to 6, as well as several streamlined small ferries. They specialized in connecting the east and west banks of the Huangpu River in this city, as well as the waterways to Donggou, Gaoqiao, Wusong, and other places, providing convenience to the citizens and enjoying extremely prosperous business. Unexpectedly, with the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the business was suspended. When the Chinese army withdrew to the west, all the ferries were confiscated by the Japanese army. The Japanese reorganized it into the "Shanghai Ferry Company" and changed the names of the ferries: No. 1 was renamed "Wusong No. 9," No. 2 was renamed "Gaoqiao No. 9," No. 3 was renamed "Chunjiang No. 9," No. 4 was renamed "Qingning No. 9," No. 5 was renamed "Zhejiang No. 9," and No. 6 was renamed "Jiangsu No. 9." The names of the smaller ones are unknown.</p>
<p>Ferry Routes After the Municipal Ferry Was Seized</p>
<p>Except for Nos. 4 and 5, namely Qingning and Zhejiang, which were first returned to the Nisshin Steamship Company for management and operated on the Chongming route, with two round trips per day, docking at Pier No. 1 on the Bund (Yangjingbangkou), they are now, along with the Nisshin Steamship Company, merged into the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. The remaining ferries are managed by the "Shanghai Ferry Company" and still operate to Donggou, Gaoqiao, Wusong, and other places. As for the rumor that the Xin Taikoo No. 9, which capsized outside Wusongkou the day before yesterday (the 16th), was formerly Ferry No. 6, it is completely incorrect. Ferry No. 6 was renamed Jiangsu No. 9 and continues to operate between Donggou and Gaoqiao in this city (docking at Pier No. 14 on the Bund, Renji Wharf).</p>
<p>Xin Taikoo No. 9 Came to Shanghai This Spring</p>
<p>The Xin Taikoo No. 9, which sank the day before yesterday, was indeed owned by the Japanese company Tokitsu. There is also the old Taikoo No. 9 (i.e., Taikoo Nos. 18 and 19), which is now operating normally between Xin'gang and Qianwei. The two ships came to Shanghai this spring and were represented by Nisshin Steamship Company to operate on the Xin'gang-Kou'an (Jingjiang County) route, specifically to seize foreign shipping business. The Xin Taikoo No. 9 ultimately capsized the day before yesterday while returning to Shanghai from Xin'gang, twelve nautical miles from Wusongkou, due to overloading of passengers and cargo. All the details have been recorded in previous reports.</p>
<p>Detailed Record of the Number of Passengers in Distress</p>
<p>After the accident, except for a small number of passengers rescued by Japanese warships and a certain Japanese tugboat, the rest completely sank to the bottom of the sea. Yesterday, it was heard that the Nisshin Steamship Company's Qing Shan No. 9 small boat went to the scene of the accident twice to salvage, but nothing was found. In addition, the ship's hull had completely disappeared. Although various parties are investigating the cause of the accident, all the crew members were killed, so it is impossible to investigate the truth. It is also impossible to estimate the losses. There has been no indication of how to handle the aftermath and salvage issues. According to information obtained yesterday by a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency from the port authorities, the ship carried a total of 469 passengers. The number of rescued people was 80 by the Japanese ship Tachibana No. 9, and 49 by the warship Yixian, for a total of 129 people. The total number of lives lost was 340 people. According to regulations, the ship could carry 100 to 150 passengers. This overloading was the main cause of the disaster.</p>

<p>The situation in various sections of Area A, north of Suzhou Creek, remained calm yesterday. The hand grenades found in the empty house at No. 506 Bazil Road were removed yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Side Has Not Yet Conducted Census</p>
<p>Residents in various sections of Area A, north of Suzhou Creek, have not been subjected to a census since the forced vaccination campaign by the Japanese side ended on the 10th of this month. Their movements have also not been restricted, so shops and residents have not yet felt inconvenienced. The situation remains calm. However, there are still many who wish to move to a better place, so rental advertisements are extremely colorful in various alleys.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Motor Transport Company's Wire Mesh Removed</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Motor Transport Company, located at the eastern end of North Jiangxi Road, was originally a British military garrison before the British-Japanese defense line was changed. After the garrison was moved, the empty house was surrounded by a wire mesh frame by the Japanese side. Now, the owner of the house has removed the wire frame and reinstalled the gate. The wire mesh outside the gate had an opening when the British military was stationed, which allowed access to the road. Now, it has been blocked by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Hand Grenades Removed from Empty House</p>
<p>The former site of the Dahe Southern Goods Store at No. 506 North Bazil Road (western end of North Jiangxi Road) is a north-facing city house located inside the old wire mesh. There are piles of sandbags in the house. After the house number plate was blown down by the wind, the sandbags inside were exposed. A wooden-handled iron hand grenade was found on top of the sandbags. Yesterday afternoon, several workers wearing yellow armbands with the inscription "Property Rental Construction Department" entered the house and removed it, and cleared the old sandbags and rubble.</p>
<p>Residents Often Subjected to Harsh Treatment When Passing Through Gaps</p>
<p>Japanese sentries at the gaps in the wire mesh at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road, Wenzan Shi Road, and Haining Road recently carried rattan whips. Residents who pass through and do not comply are often whipped. The inspection of luggage and miscellaneous items is still strict. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, a scrap metal collector entering Area A from Hongkou was found to have a lot of scrap iron in his baskets. The sentry immediately forced him to hold the baskets with both hands and stand upright at the gap for more than an hour. At the same time, the sentry occasionally poured water from basins on the crowd outside the gap. Although cars and rickshaws are prohibited from passing through, bicycles can still pass.</p>

<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held an awards ceremony at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Association representatives Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiyu, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, as well as fundraising team leaders, adoptive benefactors Zhu Qizhen, Yan Bolin, and others, totaling over 200 people, attended. Chairman Lin Kanghou presided over the ceremony, with Zhang Yichen as the master of ceremonies, and Liu Zhongying and Ge Futian as the general secretaries. Chairman Lin Kanghou first delivered the opening remarks, saying: "Ladies and gentlemen, today our association is holding an awards ceremony. We are very fortunate to have the presence of various benefactors, team leaders, and leaders of the association. There are two purposes for holding this awards ceremony. The first is to thank you for your past support of our association. The second is to hope that you will continue to help us in the future. Our association was established on December 10th last year. As of the end of September this year, we have raised funds to support 16,494 refugees in ten months. The total amount of donations received, including rice, is</p>
<p>Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand</p>
<p>Four Thousand Yuan (detailed figures please refer to the special edition of the conference). Our association's achievements are all thanks to the generous donations of all benefactors and the enthusiastic fundraising of all team leaders. Today, we are holding an awards ceremony. I, on behalf of the refugees, express my deep gratitude to you. The refugee relief work is currently facing a difficult stage again. The biggest reason is the soaring prices. The cost of supplies for refugees has more than doubled compared to the past. Previously, the cost of supplies for each refugee was two yuan per month, but now it has increased to</p>
<p>Five Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>Other medical and administrative expenses have also inevitably increased. At the same time, the cold winter is approaching, and cotton quilts and cotton clothing for refugees must also be prepared in advance. Therefore, the need for relief funds is extremely urgent, and many of the donations previously pledged by various sectors are due to expire at this time. In this difficult stage, the association has therefore made a resolution to continue promoting fundraising work. Recalling this day last year, the association held its inaugural meeting here. Today marks the first anniversary. Since the establishment of the association last year, various sectors have started promoting fundraising work, and they have fulfilled a very</p>
<p>Great Mission</p>
<p>Today, the fundraising committee of the citizens' group is holding another awards ceremony here. I hope that all of you and people from all walks of life present will continue to uphold the spirit of the association when it was first established, continue to support and contribute money and effort, to benefit the victims of the disaster. Finally, I would like to ask the leaders of the association to give us guidance." Subsequently, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, and Tao Leqin delivered encouraging speeches. Finally, Xu Jiyu presided over the awards ceremony. The awards were divided into four types: plaques, framed mirrors, shields, and medals. They were awarded separately according to the amount of donations and fundraising achievements. The situation was very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Distribution in China</p>
<p>Funds and supplies were transported to various parts of China with the assistance of British business firms and British expatriates. During the actual distribution of relief goods, there was good cooperation among groups and individuals of various nationalities. In some locations, government officials, Buddhist philanthropists, Christians, Jews from Vienna, and clergy, nurses, and nuns from the United States, France, and Canada worked together with great effort. British mission hospitals were</p>
<p>Most Active in Relief Work</p>
<p>According to news from last year, 37 church hospitals in Central China received 55,900 yuan in six months. Although the funds and supplies were mostly used to provide relief to Chinese refugees, the Central Executive Committee also provided some financial assistance to British expatriates and other foreigners who had been affected by the war, as this was also within the objectives of the fund's initiators. For Chinese refugees, financial aid, food, clothing, and medicine were provided through various relief organizations. The fund also</p>
<p>Assisted Orphans in Sichuan</p>
<p>Financial assistance was also provided for industrial projects to help refugees recover. In the past two years, the fund has directly and indirectly assisted countless men, women, old and young, farmers, and workers affected by the war. The current Central Executive Committee is trying to find the best way to use its funds to meet the remaining great needs. The Taikoo Company recently</p>
<p>Donated Five Thousand Pounds</p>
<p>Enabling the committee to allocate more funds for relief work in Sichuan. After the Tianjin floods, the fund immediately transported a large number of hospital supplies to the area. The subcommittees keep strict accounts of the funds they receive, and the relief agencies provide detailed reports on how the funds are spent. Letters from these agencies and other parties testify to the public's</p>
<p>Great Appreciation</p>
<p>For the work completed by the British Fund. The amounts of funds issued by the fund vary. The Central Executive Committee distributed funds at a meeting in September, with amounts divided into eight categories, the highest being 2,000 pounds and the lowest being 600 yuan. The Central Executive Committee has issued approximately 130,000 pounds in the past two years. Since the committee in London has already spent 40,000 pounds on purchasing medical supplies and other materials, the funds of both the London and Shanghai committees are dwindling. It is deeply hoped that all sectors will continue to donate, and we will be deeply grateful. (End)</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Japan National Federation of Social Welfare Workers will conduct a nationwide survey of the living conditions of poor people from November 24 to 30. The results of the survey are expected to reveal some signs of the impact of the China War on the lives of Japanese poor, and particular attention will be paid to the impact of various economic control plans implemented by the Japanese government. After discovering the true state of the poor, various measures are expected to be taken to help these unfortunate people. The reports recorded by the surveyors will include the health, living conditions, and changes in the living conditions of the poor since the outbreak of the war. The survey results will be submitted to the General Assembly of the Federation within the year. According to estimates by members of the Federation, there are approximately 170,000 poor families in Tokyo alone, including the poor who are scattered along the three rivers. Federation members have no clear figures for the number of poor people in rural areas.</p>

<p>Tang Huanru, a native of Dinghai, is currently the director of the parcel section of the Shanghai Postal Administration. He is 41 years old and resides at No. 188 Route Sapey, French Concession. He is currently being sued in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court by his elder brother, Tang Huanxiang (61 years old), represented by attorney Tang Juexian, for disregarding fraternal support and requesting summons and a judgment to provide support. It is claimed that the defendant is the plaintiff's younger brother. In previous decades, the</p>
<p>Family's Circumstances Were Impoverished</p>
<p>In the family, in addition to the parents, there were four brothers and four sisters. The eldest brother was Huanyao, followed by the plaintiff, the third was Huanming, and the fourth was the defendant. Initially, the eldest brother maintained the livelihood of the entire family. Unfortunately, after the eldest brother passed away, the livelihood of the entire family was precarious. The plaintiff came to Shanghai to find a job as a steward on the Zhifu steamship, earning income to maintain the family's livelihood. He also took care of the burials of his grandparents, elder brother's wife, etc., and provided dowries for his sisters, spending thousands of gold. Fortunately, the fourth brother, the defendant, had a higher aptitude. The plaintiff cultivated him with all his strength, from elementary school to middle school, until the age of 22, at the</p>

<p>The cost was over three thousand yuan. Moreover, the defendant misappropriated 2,320 Hong Kong dollars that the plaintiff had deposited with the third brother, Huanming, for his marriage. He was treated very well. Now the plaintiff is old, unemployed, and without descendants, unable to make a living, and is on the verge of despair. He has repeatedly begged the defendant for help, but has been repeatedly insulted and rejected, without receiving a single cent. However, the plaintiff was unable to accumulate savings due to educating the defendant, so he could not provide for his old age. Now the defendant has a monthly salary of four yuan [Note: original text appears incomplete], and over the years has</p>
<p>Accumulated Tens of Thousands in Savings</p>
<p>Sitting idly by while the plaintiff starves, he requests that the defendant be ordered to pay the plaintiff 1,800 yuan in support each year, for a period of five years, etc. Based on the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Yu Changzi, summoned the plaintiff and his lawyer to court yesterday afternoon to state the situation. The defendant was represented by a lawyer. After the court summoned witnesses from both sides, it announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the judgment for the 25th.</p>

<p>Ma Shao, a woman from Changshu, used to run a brothel in Beiping. When she recently returned to her hometown, she saw that Qu Xushi's 19-year-old daughter, Qu Renbao, was somewhat attractive, and had evil intentions. She used sweet words to persuade Qu Xushi, willing to take her daughter to Shanghai to find a job. Qu trusted her and entrusted her daughter to Ma Shao.</p>
<p>Bringing Her to Shanghai, after arriving in Shanghai, Ma colluded with Zhang Shuigen, Wu Rongbao, and Chen Tan, all from Suzhou, and on the 6th of last month, sold the woman to Fu Lao Si, who ran a brothel, for 400 yuan. On the one hand, Ma returned to Changshu and told Qu Xushi that her daughter was missing after arriving in Shanghai. Qu then followed her to Shanghai the day before yesterday to search, but somehow a dispute arose on Avenue Édouard VII. The police investigated and brought them to the Old Gate Police Station, where Western Chief Detective Fang Teer, Chinese Detective Guo Ruiquan, and Detective Zhou Wenqing, after investigation, Ma Shao began to</p>
<p>Confess the truth. The detectives arrested Zhang Shuigen, Wu Rongbao, and Chen Tan at No. 34, Lane 726, Fuzhou Road, and No. 541, Route Cardinal Mercier, and rescued Qu Renbao. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for trafficking in women from good families and forcing them into prostitution. He also stated that the woman had been working as a prostitute for more than 20 days. When questioned, each defendant made evasive statements and hired attorney Tang Youwei to defend them. Judge Feng Shide, after verifying the confessions, ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<p>The houses in Cide Lane on Zhejiang Road belong to the Hardoon estate. This spring, the rental management office issued a notice to increase rents, resulting in a 30% increase. Recently, the Hardoon rental management office sent letters to the tenants again, stating that due to the sharp decline in exchange rates and increased repair costs, it was necessary to readjust rental prices. Tenants were instructed to go to the office to renegotiate the rent within ten days of receiving the letter, otherwise they would be required to move out next month. Tenants learned from the rental management office that the notice of this decision was indeed intended to continue increasing rents, and the amount of the increase was significant. Furthermore, a large tip was required. Therefore, the tenants jointly engaged lawyer Huang Xiubo to take appropriate legal action to prevent the rental management office from increasing the burden on tenants again during this extraordinary period.</p>

According to a reporter from the China News Agency, the notice was posted on the 13th and has been up for a week as of yesterday. Not only has no one inquired, but business has been very slow.

<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>I have just read in the local news section of your newspaper on October 17th about the launching of the Movement to Promote Honesty and Integrity in this city by various sectors, and the organization of a committee, with my humble name listed as a member, which I find extremely astonishing. Since the Shanghai war, I have suffered great losses and have become utterly discouraged. At a time when the cost of living is soaring and it is difficult to make a living, I can barely secure a stable life, let alone have the energy to participate in group meetings. Moreover, propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame are the four pillars of our country, and the emphasis should be on practical action, not on superficial reporting in newspapers. My conduct in life is based on honesty and trustworthiness. Since I have not participated in this meeting, I must write to request a correction in order to clarify the matter. I would be grateful if you could publish this. With best wishes,</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Luo Ziqiang, October 18th</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>I was dismayed to see my humble name listed on the list of members of the Movement to Promote Honesty and Integrity Committee in yesterday's newspaper. Since the August 13th incident, I have not been participating in any associations due to their complexity and unclear aims. I have been staying at home reading books. Fearing that this may cause trouble in the future, I respectfully request a correction. Please accept my regards.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Remembering Mr. Lu Xun <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Guang</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the death of our great literary master, Mr. Lu Xun. He was a mentor to young people all over China and even the world, a revolutionary realist writer. His lifelong struggle was for the liberation and reform of the nation and society, and for all of humanity.</p>
<p>Using his supreme artistic skills, he wrote many essays, prose, and novels, exposing the corruption and darkness of society and pointing out a bright path for the masses to follow.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun's life was a battle against hypocrisy, treachery, and ugliness, and against cowardly opportunists and traitors. He was the Chinese Gorky, leading many national revolutionary mass writers. He participated in the unified national war effort. In 1935, he organized an anti-fascist group, giving a strong rebuke to barbarous fascism!</p>
<p>"A writer, of course, needs the necessary skills, but even more, he needs a progressive consciousness and a lofty human dignity... We need those writers who can serve as pioneers and guides." This is what Mr. Lu Xun said. He himself was such a practitioner. He stood at the forefront of humanity in China and the world. He was not a hypocrite, he did not let go of his enemies. Although he was persecuted, attacked, slandered, and threatened, he remained active and bravely moved forward.</p>
<p>He was indeed a comrade of the oppressed classes and oppressed nations, a model revolutionary writer of the new era. His great personality and great works of art are truly models for the masses. We should learn from him.</p>
<p>His uncompromising fighting spirit and love for humanity will forever be preserved in the hearts of all people in China and the world. Although he died three years ago, his art and spirit will live forever in the world, generation after generation, and will never disappear!</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun must be smiling and resting peacefully in the earth, because the sons and daughters of China are now working hard on the front lines and in the rear for this great national liberation war.</p>

<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>——War Zone Notes from the Beijing-Shanghai Line——</p>
<p>Night, an October night.</p>
<p>The sky was without a crescent moon, and no blinking stars; it was a pitch black.</p>
<p>Continuous autumn rain had turned the road into mud. Car tracks were carved into the road surface: a car was trudging along the tracks carrying two thousand cotton vests and nineteen comrades.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, one wheel climbed out of the mud, but another sank in. No matter how fast the wheels turned, the car refused to move. The car body shook like a steamer in rough seas. The comrades all lay on the cotton vests.</p>
<p>In the hazy light, it felt like the car body was shaking particularly violently. The driver said it was stuck too deep, and we had to lighten the load.</p>
<p>Rubbing away the sleepiness, with a mumbling tone, each person groped in the dark for their shoes and climbed out of the car. The mud covered our shoes as soon as we stepped out. But no one regretted getting their leather shoes dirty; we felt only happiness, like we had returned to our childhood, and we perked up.</p>
<p>We hurried to find some straw by the side of the road and spread a large piece of it out. We moved the cotton vests out of the car compartment one by one, hoping that the car could jump out of the deep pit before all the vests were moved. But we only heard the engine roar heavily, and the mud still held the four wheels stuck. Until the last vest left the car compartment, it still stood there motionless.</p>
<p>We began to get anxious. If we couldn't get out of this deep pit, it wouldn't be safe to be in this place near the front line after dawn.</p>
<p>"It's time to exert our strength!" A loud voice rang out from among the comrades, followed by the sound of mud and shoes stirring. The comrades quickly distributed themselves behind and to the sides of the car.</p>
<p>"Everyone push together... Hai yo hum..."</p>
<p>More than twenty arms supported the car body; the driver accelerated the engine, the wheels moved forward slightly, pursuing new hope, and each person added more strength to their arms.</p>
<p>"Everyone work hard, push forward together, everyone...</p>
<p>Push out of the mud pit in front..."</p>
<p>The song boosted the strength of our arms. Finally, with a "crack" sound, the car broke free from the pit and drove into another shallower track. New hope came, and laughter broke through the silent darkness.</p>
<p>We packed the vests more energetically, took off our muddy shoes, and climbed back into the car. In the intermittent vibration of the engine, the truck slowly crawled like a camel in the desert. The car compartment once again emitted a satisfied laugh, and fatigue no longer attacked anyone.</p>
<p>However, because the road had not been easily repaired, the damage was too severe. The car was soon blocked again by a small stream, and the car tilted to one side.</p>
<p>The comrades' laughter stopped with this blow. Putting on our wet shoes, we stepped out of the car and inspected it. We felt that it was not enough to rely on the strength of our dozen or so people. Looking at the watch by the light of the flashlight, there was still a considerable time before dawn, and we felt more relaxed. Leaving the driver to guard the vehicle, we, led by a comrade familiar with the local situation, groped in the dark to the house of the nearby village chief.</p>
<p>Out of necessity, we had to knock on the door of the village chief's house. The one who opened the door was the village chief, around forty years old. We explained our intentions very politely and expressed our sincere apologies.</p>
<p>"This is a matter of the country, and we ordinary people should do our part. You must be tired. Rest for a while and let me call a few strong men to help you. They are familiar with this kind of thing. This is not the first time." While saying this, he lit a lantern and hurriedly went out.</p>
<p>The comrades' hearts were even more active.</p>
<p>In a moment, the village chief led a dozen young strong men, carrying various tools, and carrying bamboo poles and wooden boards. We went to meet them, and everyone went back to the road.</p>
<p>Along the way, we didn't hear a single complaint. They had all been awakened from their sweet dreams.</p>
<p>With skilled techniques and collective strength, without reducing the car's load, the car was pushed onto the right road. The comrades were indescribably grateful to these strong men. There were no hypocritical pleasantries, only sincere gratitude on their faces.</p>
<p>Finally, the village chief told us that the roadbed ahead was much stronger. We thanked the village chief and the dozen young men, got into the car, and disappeared into the darkness, leaving behind a dozen kind and honest faces.</p>
<p>The east revealed a faint dawn, and we continued on our journey.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Mountain Spirit <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Sealing off a realm of quiet, fallen leaves slowly piled up thickly in the deep autumn, and no one walked through, bringing a bit of the city's mud to dye it. If many trees were planted on this mountain, it would naturally be even more gloomy, with branches and vines intertwined, forming an umbrella, blocking sunlight and wind, and the cool shade under the trees would be a good place to escape the summer heat. Even in heavy rain, not much would leak through. However, I never liked these things. I can't help but think of those leaves that are too thick and too dense. You say, the branches and leaves are tangled together, and it's hard to tell which is on whose tree, how dark the light must be. It feels like my heart is wrapped in a piece of black gauze, with terror, restlessness, also symbolizing a shadow in front of me. In the overly quiet air, even the faint breathing of a crow standing upright on a tree with its claws can be heard. The sound of a bell rang out from somewhere, making the dark mountain so trembling, like a winding and shining ribbon pulling a heart towards the heights and far away, flickering a few times in the air, and then it became dark again, and as a result, this ribbon was naturally broken.</p>
<p>Broken… So, do you feel a burst of emptiness in your heart, with gloominess pressing down and darkness surrounding you? Do you feel that this mountain really has a majestic, sad life? In the dark valleys at dusk, you can taste the trembling of life in the stillness. You succumb to nature and marvel at their mysteries. Perhaps you have left the familiar face of the mountain, you have had a long friendship, you know every tree, every stone, every flower on the mountain. Your understanding is absolutely different from others, you have another face in your mind, they become your flowers, your stones, your bridges, your friends. Therefore, you have made an alliance with the fish, gulls, and birds, so a mountain does not look serious in your eyes but is amiable. You should say that the mountain spirit is not a terrifying but a lovely friend… Alas, there are really too many mountains, where you and I are afraid of having mountains? "At first glance, there is no disgust, only Mount Jingting", who does not have a lovely mountain that evokes their own emotions in the midst of war? You can't help but think about their mornings and evenings, when the morning sun rises, when the sunset glows brilliantly, when the mountain mist is hazy, when the smoke and rain cover the ridge, when the sunset reflects, …</p>
<p>You are concerned about them but do not pity them. The mountain spirit is not like a small object to be caressed, it contains a majestic body, a proud momentum, and a healthy physique. On sunny days, it is the first to be covered by the high sun, and on cloudy days, it is covered with a thick layer of smoky fog. It is bright during the day and gloomy at night. As long as you have a hometown with mountains, you will love that mountain. If you can go for a few visits every year, you will know that mountain is not just a mountain, there is an unnamed mountain spirit, you can distinguish the declarations of those flowers, grasses, rocks, trees and hermitages, and you can use a heart to taste their thousands of different emotions.</p>
<p>When they are haggard, they also explain your depression. Does your hometown have mountains? Are the mountains still the same? ………… Of course, I can't help but miss a mountainous city. The Dangxiu River tells the wisdom of the people, and the simplicity of the mountains teaches the people simplicity. The mountains near the river are open, the mountains on the sandbar are sparse, and the mountains on the island are misty, they explain many different personalities. When I was young, I knew their tranquility, and after the turmoil, I saw their depression again. Six or seven months of time have made the mountain spirit haggard, but hardship has also made it more resilient. The mountain is a bit old, but the sound of the waves seems to be stronger than before.</p>
<p>People who live in their hometown have also seen your home mountains? What does the mountain spirit look like? Is it more haggard? Is it more angry? You know the heart of the mountain. You know the anger of the mountain spirit, you know the black of the mountains, the green of the maple forest, you also know how to understand the life of the mountain with loftiness, majesty and solidity. You will never just make old dreams, you will also accompany it to be angry, accompany it to avenge. Although it is sealed off with a piece of quiet, the center is full of volcanic flames, this is the roar of the mountain spirit and yours, which is more touching than your nostalgia.</p>

<h3 id="e99">About Children's Theater: "Little Five Righteous Ones" to be Performed Soon <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Erbei</p>
<p>——Collective Creation by the China Drama Association</p>
<p>It is indeed not easy to engage in children's drama. Its plot, meaning, dialogue, and actions all have their unique aspects. The plot must be as clear as a sunny day, with the sound of gurgling springs, the lively meaning of myths, straightforward morals, simple dialogue, and musicalized actions complemented by imaginative, patterned sets. Moreover, the entire scene must be filled with a thriving and lively atmosphere, unfolding an optimistic path, and instilling a spirit of self-improvement in children's minds.</p>
<p>It is very inappropriate to use ordinary adult scripts as children's plays. Children's plays must be created with children as the target audience, and the playwright must also possess a naive mind and a thorough understanding of children's psychology, so that the realm he writes about is the realm of children.</p>
<p>Children are not suitable for watching tragedies, because their pure hearts, untouched by dust, have not yet experienced the vicissitudes of life like adults. It is best to have farces and comedies, with meaningful humor and implicit joy, so that they reach the realm of "truth, goodness, and beauty."</p>
<p>It is recently heard that the China Drama Research Association is collectively creating several children's plays, preparing them for performance by children's drama groups. In the barren field of Chinese children's drama, this news is indeed a promising new seedling. It is heard that the second performance of the association at the Xindu Sunday Children's Theater will be the children's play "Little Five Righteous Ones," written by Ouyang Huan through collective creation.</p>

<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>— Sixth of Miscellaneous Reminiscences by the Plum Blossoms</p>
<p>Daily Life</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's life is also very simple. He gets up around nine o'clock every day (except when staying up late when performing). He usually does not have a morning snack. After washing up, he goes to his study to read newspapers and incoming mail, and writes a few large characters. Lunch is at twelve o'clock, with no more than four meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and one soup. He does not indulge in extravagance. Regardless of delicacies or coarse food, he always finishes two bowls of rice. Spicy food is detrimental to his voice, so he avoids it. Otherwise, he does not pick and choose his food. There is a special delicacy in Lingnan called "He Chong" (paddy worms), which look like shelled snails, about an inch long, kept in crystal cups, with mottled colors. The Cantonese people eat them alive. Mr. Mei also likes them, and finds them as sweet as sugar. (Note: He Chong are produced in the paddy fields near the coast of Guangdong. According to the "Guangdong New Language," some can grow up to ten feet long. They have mouths at each segment, and are green when raw, and red-yellow when cooked. In summer and autumn, when the early and late rice matures, so do the worms. When the tide rises and floods the fields, they break off and come out with the tide, floating during the day and sinking at night. When they float, the surface of the water turns purple. Their strange shape is daunting at first sight, let alone eating them alive!) After lunch, he studies plum blossom painting with Mr. Tang Dizhi. He learns English from an English teacher every day. After finishing his lessons, he socializes with visiting friends, or handles matters at this time in an orderly manner. In the evening, he mostly attends banquets with friends. Occasionally, he gathers with two or three close friends in a small market building, not drinking alcohol, or drinking only to a light buzz. After dinner, he likes to watch movies. When he enters the theater, he always waits until the lights are turned off, otherwise the audience's gazes will all be focused on him. There are those who come forward to express their admiration, and those who ask for autographs. It truly becomes like being on Shanyin Road, where one is overwhelmed with greetings! After returning from watching the movie, he listens to wireless radio, which has become his only hobby and his best companion in his lonely life, seeking spiritual comfort. He likes to receive foreign music, especially German Opera. After hearing a pleasant piece of music, he can stay up all night, unaware of the dawn.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Another Buddhist Film Coming: Xinhua Plans to Film "Sakyamuni" <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Di</p>
<p>Yi Hua Company is preparing to bring "Guan Shi Yin" to the screen, which is the first sign of the birth of Buddhist films. But as far as the reporter knows, Xinhua Film Studio is also planning to film "Sakyamuni" at the same time. First, because the background of "Sakyamuni" is India, in addition to all the Indian buildings in the film, dozens of elephants are also needed, so the exterior scenes are prepared to be taken in India. Second, if possible, "Sakyamuni" is prepared to be filmed using three-color film. If financial resources can be arranged, then perhaps several experts will be hired from the United States to come to Shanghai to serve as consultants.</p>
<p>Due to the above two points, the production of "Sakyamuni" will become an astonishing figure in terms of money consumption. Now, the script story is being written by playwright Zhou Yibai. After it is written, it still needs to be divided into scenes, so it will probably take a considerable period of time before filming starts, but the exterior photography team is already being prepared and organized, and may set off next month.</p>
<p>The director of this film has been decided to be Fang Peilin, who is also in charge of the set design. The cinematographer is Xue Boqing, and the male and female leads are Mei Xi and Chen Yunshang.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's lover, Paulette Goddard, tries on new clothes for the first time, and her posture is even more beautiful. Her most recent film is "The Cat and the Canary."</p>
<h3 id="e102">Memories of Old Shisan Dan <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Wei Xuan</p>
<p>The last time Old Shisan Dan came to Shanghai was about twenty years ago. I don't remember the exact date, but the performance venue was definitely at the Danggui First Stage on Fourth Road. There was a square electric pole standing on the roof, with the words "Genuine Old Shisan Dan" written on it. On a certain Sunday day show, the full version of "New An Post" was performed, and "Cutting Down Zidu" was performed at night. I once watched both the day and night shows at the invitation of a friend. "New An Post" was originally created by Hou Ling. Although he was nearly sixty years old at the time, his stability in the stilt work and the appropriateness of his expressions were definitely beyond the reach of his successors. When the performance reached the bridal chamber, some guests got up and left. Suddenly, Xu Shaoqing, the stage manager, was seen standing at the door, shouting loudly: "The Shanghai people are not qualified after all! Such a good show, leaving without watching it to the end, I'm afraid you won't have the chance to hear it again in this lifetime." So the guests sat down again, and only two or three of those who had left returned. At night, he cross-dressed and played "Cutting Down Zidu." It can be said that a Dan role being able to perform this play is unprecedented and unrepeatable. It is a masterpiece that is not easy to perform lightly and rarely seen. When he started fighting with a spear, he completely got rid of the air of a Dan role, and his martial arts skills were very proficient. By the time it came to the scene in the Golden Palace, his state of madness was intense but not fiery. Every move was in perfect synchronization with the drumbeats, and the applause followed accordingly. The final posture of pouncing on the tiger was particularly miraculous and clean, making people clap their hands and shout in amazement. The entire audience almost felt as if they were on the scene, and their minds were captivated. Even now, when I occasionally talk about it with friends, I can't help but gesticulate and dance, regretting that I can't see it again. From this, it can be seen that the old performers have real skills, unlike the recent performers who only dazzle people with their appearance, which is not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Extra Member of the Board of Revenue, Expectant Intendant of a Circuit</p>
<p>However, his colleagues respected his character and admired his outstanding abilities, so although everyone felt that his Intendant-style attire was unsophisticated, they did not dare to mock him with a mocking tone. As a result, he gained the nickname "Li Yuanwai" (Li the Esquire). In principle, "Yuanwai" is the title of a wealthy landlord in the countryside. The reason why Li Laogongfeng got this nickname was not because he had money or land, but simply because his attire resembled that of a "Yuanwai."</p>
<p>Among the famous actors of ancient and modern times, Old Tan had the grandest style. His diet, daily life, and all the equipment in his home were extremely exquisite. Even the clothes he wore in private were imitated as much as possible from those of Beizi (imperial sons) and Beile (imperial grandsons). His clothes were all arranged according to a fixed number and order of cotton and fur-lined clothes, changing every day. He wore white socks, Yun shoes, a satin robe, a woolen vest, and a melon-skin cap with pearls and gems. He held a snuff bottle in his hand, and a sachet and jade pendant were tied to his waist. When he went out, he sat in a sedan chair with a double-bridged frame. He really looked the part. At the same time, his residence was frequented by high officials, dignitaries, Beizi, and Beile. His colleagues saw his extravagant behavior, which resembled the style of a Beizi and Beile, so the title "Tan Beile" spread throughout the nine cities.</p>
<p>Because Juxian Daoren came from a non-professional background, he tried his best to avoid the habits of actors. Usually, most people in the Pear Garden do not grow beards, and it is even rarer to see people wearing glasses on weekdays. But Juxian was different. Whenever he was resting or not being summoned, he would grow a beard. (In my book "Pear Garden Shadows," there are three photos of famous actors. Excluding the scenes and non-professional performers, he is the only one who wears a beard in casual clothes. Moreover, both the photos at fifty-eight and eighty-eight years old have beards. Photos of him without a beard have never been seen outside.) He wore dark glasses on his nose, silk boots, a sable hat, and a leather coat. He looked dignified and upright. If you didn't know in advance that he was an amateur turned professional actor, you would simply take him for an expectant Intendant of a Circuit. And that's how he got the nickname "Expectant Intendant of a Circuit." One (122)</p>
