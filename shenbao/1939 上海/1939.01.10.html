<h3 id="c15">論「反共」 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>在精衛通敵叛國的通電，早已遭全國人民的共棄．本報也曾一再爲文、予以駁斥。不料據昨報所傳．在氏近又在港散佈謠言，混淆視聽，並特別强調「防共」點，以淆惑人心．中傷國共合作．離間中國人民的團結．其用心之不良，真可痛恨。因此，我們不憚辭費、再就「防共」一點，加以論列，以正視聽。</p>
<p>所謂「共同防共」就是逼使中國加入「日德義反共公約」。因此，首先我們必須明白反共公的的本質是什麼？如果加人這個公的，於中國是吾有利？</p>
<p>我們可以直截回答一句說．反共公的是法西斯侵略者一混淆黑白」的陰謀．是他們掩飾侵略的虛偽幌子。英國名政論家哥特曼對這曾有很好的解釋：</p>
<p>侵略陣綫把「共產主義的恐嚇物」呌起來．可以迷混民主資本主義國家中的勁敵．有許多自由主義者，也就此受了它的迷混。這些自由主義者．倘使沒有受到法西斯反共烟慕的蒙蔽．就早會反對侵略了．</p>
<p>侵略者利用了民主國家這個弱點．就在「反共」的烟幕下進行他們的侵略。德意聯合進攻西班牙，說是「反共」；希特勒攫奪奧國宰割捷克，說是「反共」；日本軍閥大舉侵略三民主義的中華民國，又說是「反共」！旣是反共，褐衫軍隊爲什麼不向莫斯科開。而偏偏「揀着軟的欺」？旣是反共，張鼓峯的衝突該是一個很好反共的機會．日本軍閥爲什麼偏偏又縮轉了頭？這樣看來．「日德意反共公的」雖然打着「反共」的幌子，實際上却正是有組織的先向英美法等民主國家進攻；不久以前曾盛傳日德意軍事同盟就要簽字，這同盟更明白是以英美法等爲對象的。簡單一句話。日德意反共公的就是一個侵略的同盟。中國是被侵略者．試問願不願自投羅綱，去做侵略者的附庸呢？這是一點。其决，中國以三民主義立國的基礎，三民主義精神即在民主政治的實現。加人法西斯的「反共公約」，等於取消三民主義，取消國民黨。再次，反共公的不僅以蘇聯為敵，英美法等民主國家也是它進攻的對象。今日援助中國抗戰的正是蘇聯以及英美法等國，加入「反共公約」，等於「認賊作父」，而白絕於友人。以上幾點都是就對外而說。第二，再就對內而言，誰都知道國共合作是今天中國抗戰的民族統一戰錢的基礎，是中國抗戰取得最後勝利最大的保證。國共兩黨十年來痛苦的經騐。造就了日本帝國主義侵人的機會，使中華民族生存成了問題。現在，他們終於毅然蠲棄前嫌，密切合作，來搶救中國的獨立與生存了。在今天，誰都不能吾認國共兩黨像兄弟一樣站在一起的事實。在今天，中國共產黨顯己改變它革命的政策，爲三民主義的中國而努力，中國共產黨的忠於抗戰，連日本人也不吾認，這觀於日本帝國主義及漢奸對共產黨仇恨的深刻，就可以證明。</p>
<p>國共合作旣成了阻止日帝國主義侵略一個巨大的力量，日本軍閥及漢奸們自然多方百計要來破壞它。他們利用了某部份人的成見，就散佈關於國共摩擦的許多謠言，企圖拆散他們的團結。「反共」在今天已成了漢奸進行賣國的虛幌子，已成了日本軍閥滅亡中國的代名詞，這一點，中國人民是應該加以極大注意的。</p>
<p>因此，今天中國的人民必須用全力來擁護國共的合作，必須深切體騐中山先生在民國二年時的昭示：「黨勢之大小不必問，只須問吾黨所主張之政策及平日行動之能吾合乎公理，能吾與時勢相應。果所抱之政策正大明確，且得一般國民之贊同，雖千難百折，必可望最後之戰勝。至於對於他黨，除商榷政見而外，一切意氣之爭，匪特非所必要，且足以損政黨之榮譽。」</p>
<p>只要中國人民大家竭誠擁護國共合作，一切敵人漢奸的陰謀就無所施技；只要國共能夠加緊合作，民族抗戰統一戰綫必將愈益鞏固，中國抗戰必然可以獲得最後的勝利。</p>

<p>— 嚴速寄自皖南</p>
<p>因爲記者昨天晚上聽到項英軍長談起、新四軍對付日本俘虜的方法、是非常有趣味的、所以記者要求和日本俘虜當面談一次話、</p>
<p>據項軍長說、新四軍不僅是不殺害俘虜、不僅　優待俘虜、而且能够積極地給日　俘虜以出入·通訊·讀書·工作·的自由、因此日本俘虜在新四軍那邊、如同在自己家裹樣、身上穿着與新四軍同樣的制服、頭上戴着靑天白日的軍帽、在沒有事的時候、可以到大街上去自由逛逛老百姓和弟兄們看見了也不覺得奇怪、新四軍專門負責管敎俘虜的工作的機關是「敵人工作部」、據項軍長說、新四軍作戰半年來俘獲的日偽軍、已有五百九十多人、而且其中有幾個已經可以參加新四軍做政治工作了、</p>

<h3 id="c52">上海之金融巿塲 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 张一凡</p>
<p>上海旣陷，租界間人口驟增，然民生經濟决不能增大上海商業市塲若何活力，故金融活動，理應繼續停滯。然事實竟不然：蓋日方在華北宇倡「聯銀」，羅刮法幣，拂滬掉走外滙，我方乃毅然實施外滙統制，各方不明眞相，誤解我方用意，外商銀行甚至廢除「紳士協定」，暫停對我幣制金融之合作，雖我中央銀行始終按法定滙率供給外滙，初時且每週供給四五十萬鎊，實巳遠超上海對外貿易之經常需要以上。猶不獲諒解，利用彼等在華特權，在我中央銀行外，依然維持其賣買外匯之「自由市塲」，每日製造驚人之黑牌，動機雖未必在助桀爲虐，搗亂法幣，但事實却在供敵利用，打擊法幣。加以無知國人，唯恐法幣跌價，爭先逃亡其資金；或盡量向外定貨，以免减少外滙損失，又因我方限制各種奢侈品與非必需品之輸入，唯利是圖者，更增大其進口，以謀獲利。於是黑市塲上外滙需求大急，滙率慘落。從向造成投機局面以此種外滙投機爲始，現金，證劵等等市塲，亦在交易所外，各設暗市，蛹蠕而動。沉滯之上海金融市塲，由是在投機空氣中，重歸於活潑。</p>
<p>（四）票據市塲之復活</p>
<p>此種不合理之轉變，如以銀錢業之票據流通額的消長中，即可發見其變動之過程。（單位國幣百萬元）</p>
<p>上海銀錢業票據之交換及牧解</p>
<p>銀行票據之行使，原自承兌所成立後乃得發展。去年七月交換額且達九億餘萬元之空前紀錄。然戰事一起，即一落千丈。至本年二月巳跌剩八千五百萬。但其後即逐漸回復；今已幾與前年各月之交換額不相上下。最近中中交三行之交換劃頭票，且得外商銀行之合作，許以與外灘劃頭同等使用，不復歧視。此不特使上海之通貨市塲，較前可益爲活潑；今後之交換額，亦必更有增大之希望。</p>
<p>錢業公單收解數，本年各月，較戰後最初各月，似亦激减。此固由於各莊之收縮信用，愼重放款，有以致之。但主因尚在將戰前遺留之未到期債務，轉劃爲帳面之故，故未可以爲其消長之準則。</p>
<p>（五）金利市塲之變遷</p>
<p>自幣制改革，集中發行以來；市塲通貨之供需，已有調節之機構爲之平衡，故往年之高利狀態，已逐漸回平。民二十五年份，銀錢界以至財政當局，一致倡議推行低金利政策，藉以促進國民經濟建設。故上海息市，最高不過一角。二十六年上半期，曾因茶市及投機風潮而一度緊張，亦僅一角六七分，且旋即回小。</p>
<p>滬戰旣起，情勢驟變。各莊信用大縮，求款至難。即一躍而抵二角。供應者尚鮮。今已回軟，故供應者實更難覓。觀夫錢業公單收解數之下降，可以想見。</p>
<p>由銀行票據交換額今昔之消長一端觀之，可知銀行業聯合凖備委員會現開之息市，較能表明今日上海金融市塲之盈虧。自實施安定金融辦法後，該會除公單拆息，承兌滙蔡貼現率外，又多一種滙劃拆息。此種匯劃票據，今日雖有非法貼水，且每千會一度達七八十元，但欲取得此種信用仍不易，故今日之此項拆息，已貴至二角五分，劃頭信用，取得更難。去冬之拆息已達三角。</p>
<p>此外，中中交農四行成立貼放委員會，辦理同業貼放後，上海又多一種息市，此卽該會公佈之貼現率及放款息是。前者以週息爲標準，後者以月息爲標凖。該會負調節戰時金融之責，故其貼放之政策性，實較市塲性爲大。人莫不知當局對上海金融市塲，頗有收縮通貨之意。故該會之步驟，素以當局之意旨爲轉依。此爲不待言者矣。惟滬市情勢特殊，故該會之活動，尚未見發生若何影響，自屬憾事耳。</p>
<p>（五）金市投機與海外金價</p>
<p>前已言之：復活上海金融市塲之關鍵在外滙之非法投機。幣制改革前，我國滙市，向受金銀價格之　動而變動。自法幣脫離白銀而進爲管理通貨後，即由中中交三行，以人爲力量，實行釘住一先令二便士半之法定率而穩定之。與世界金銀價格之變遷，完全失其聯繫。然自我國於廿七年三月初實施外滙統制，從而發生非法的黑市塲以來，投機者又濫用金銀價之變動，作爲掀風作浪之根據。其意中國在外正貨，大半尚屬白銀，並未換爲黃金或外匯。是以金銀比價之變遷，足以影響法幣之外匯基礎，銀價跌，卽外　某礎削弱；反之則堅，加以本年以來，英鎊因歐局不斷緊張而波動，中美白銀協定，又屆期滿之年。是以倫敦金價，於本年五月後，卽起漲風。其時上海巳有非法滙市，故影響所及，更如雪上加霜。上海現金價，於六月中即漲至二千元後一度回軟，旋又重漲，至十一月允烈，竟創二千零六十八元新高價。</p>
<p>上海與倫教金價之變動（指數以廿六年七月爲一百分）單位：上梅國幣元，倫敦便士數，去年八月前，上海係僄金價，九月係標準價，十月至廿七年四月係銀行收買價，以後係黑巿塲現金收盤價。</p>
<p>上海標金市塲本爲投機者　集之所，成交數年達三四千萬後，即告冷落。如昆二十四年四五月間，成交數常達二百七八十萬條，同年十一月即激减爲三十九萬條。二十五年十一月且只有二萬八千七百條之成交，至民二十六年而允少，一二月間已成交者已僅一萬條左石，後僅七八千條，至七月而僅三千六百四十七條。滬戰發生後即完全停止。自出現非法交易後，觀夫高低價間相差額之鉅，且較倫教之上落比率尤大，可見各方角逐之烈。</p>
<p>近年上海金價高低價之差額比較（單位國幣元）</p>
<p>自中美惜款與中英借款之先後成立，白銀協定之延期談判又告成功，加以國際局勢對華之日轉有利，抗戰之戰局又有進步之轉變。是以人心大振，全市略見回穩。加以財部又頒行國內產金必需售與中央銀行及其代理機關，初步推行黃金國有政策，以充實外匯基礎此於淪陷中之上海金市，雖不能發揮若何效力；但在金市之投機心理上，亦不無起若干之作用也。</p>

<p>浦東上川邊界情勢甫鬆、上南邊界又趨緊張、華方游擊隊不明人數之一隊兵力、業已進駐離浦東大道三四里之北蔡。嚴家橋·六里橋·御家橋·一帶、威脅南碼頭與上南路日軍防地、連日巳發生遭遇戰多决、日軍顯受嚴重打擊、五日間死傷二三十人之譜、人晚復有</p>

<p>自奉令至浙東定海整理後，當局近復派××部隊、由浙西方面、開入川沙南滙奉賢一帶、繼續活動、故各處形勢復緊、日方亦已加緊戒備、上川上南沿綫一帶、日方已開始增兵駐防、惟浦江東西交通、均照常、</p>

<p>增厚基金</p>

<p>我國政府爲增籌抗戰時期經費、决定舉辦專賣制度、先由各省政府推行、今浙江省政府試辦捲烟專賣收效、又舉辦火柴專賣、歸捲烟管理處兼辦之、茲誌群情如下、</p>
<p>管現之後</p>
<p>非常時期農礦工商管理條例頒佈後、規定棉·絲·蔴·羊毛·及其製品·食糧·植物油·茶·糖·皮革·木材·鹽·煤·焦炭·煤油·汽油·柴油·潤滑油·酒精·水泥·石灰·火柴·玻璃·磚瓦·肥料·電氣機器工具·敎育用具·交通器材·以及礦產等物品、實施管理、必要時得收歸國營或投資合辦、凡非經經濟部核准者、不得歇業停業或停工、同時得依公平價格、分別收買其全部或一部份、自實施以來、頗收成效、</p>
<p>推行專賣</p>
<p>專賣制度、在財政上占有重要地位、故晚近各國都將消費稅改爲專賣制度、以裕國庫收入、我國政府過去雖有專賣之計劃、但均未見實行、今因專賣制度爲增籌抗戰時期經費唯一良法、故决先由各省政府設法推行、其合符專賣之貨物、有烟·酒·茶·鹽·搪·火柴·捲烟等、聞浙江省政府等、先辦理據烟及火柴之專賣、一俟辦理收效、再行擴充、</p>
<p>試辦收效</p>
<p>浙省試辦捲烟專賣後、復制定戰時火柴專賣章程、經該府第一〇二九决會議通過施行在案、指定捲烟管理處兼辦火柴專賣事務、該處奉令後、業已籌備就緒、於今年一月一日起實行、關於各地火柴專賣事宜、應有機關負責辦理、特指定各縣分處兼辦轄區內火柴專賣事宜、不另設機關、以資撙節、至於火柴專賣章程從略</p>
<p>專賣益處</p>

<p>大陸報云、上海國際紅十字會行將出版之消息公報中載有中國國際救濟會常務幹會貝克博士之報告、據稱、湘省·桂北·贛東·及粵省一部份，爲特別嚴重之瘧疾傳染病所苦、致救護該各地平民疾病與創傷之救濟工作、完全不敷應付、按貝克博士近赴</p>
<p>西南視察</p>
<p>救濟情况告畢、上月間返抵上海、至於內地之未能應付救濟情况者、貝克博士舉有原因兩端、一因缺少運輸器具、故藥物缺乏、二因華籍醫師與護士之意氣銷沉、關於可能之補救方法、貝克博士提議、應以基金辦理定期汽車載送事務、俾載迫近戰綫之醫院人員撤退、而醫師與護士之</p>
<p>意氣不堅</p>
<p>者、渠信乃因該地將有日軍到達時、並無護送彼等撤退之保證也、渠聞有許多醫生與護士恐被遺棄於後、故未至必要時、卽已棄職而行矣、貝克、博士對於國府盡可能援助戰時難民之計劃、備加贊揚、據博士云、分散難民於距公路鐵道若干距離之鄕間、乃减少普通人民困苦之最可奏效的辦法、博士於</p>
<p>長沙大火</p>
<p>後、不久到達該地、雖有美國長老會等敎會房產四處、依然無恙、但該城中之其他許多敎會、已盡付一炬、除少數例外、長沙之救濟計劃、工作頓利、且極奏效、博士勾留於該瓦礫城中時、會見分散難民人鄕村、並見難民之出示其證明文件者、則發給遷居津貼費、按貝克博士此次視察、足跡</p>
<p>遍於六省</p>
<p>歷程三千七百哩、因交通困難、渠曾於某數區中、搭舢舨而行、由香港搭輸至海口、首决得見今猖獗於中國西南之瘧疾、據稱、北海與海口雖有許多漁民在該區淪爲戰時難民、但此尚非該區中主要之救濟問題、在昆明·成都與重慶·居住問題、較難民問題猶甚、成都與重慶附近、有</p>
<p>戰時孤兒</p>
<p>均由蔣夫人監督而照顧之、估計每一孤兒之維持費、每　五元巳足、昆明與重慶、因揚子江流域與華南難民之擁入、致房屋奇缺、竟致無論有錢與吾、均難覓安居處所、而在昆明、則絕無難民問題、貴陽之惰况、大類滇川、但有大批華籍醫師與護士由戰區或受</p>
<p>戰事威脅</p>
<p>之區中避往該地、貝克博士到達貴州時、省府之救濟計劃、尚未實施、但博士相信、渠離黔不久、該項計劃、當巳付諸試行、計劃中包括在湘黔邊界公路上設一登記站、該公路乃由湘入黔之唯一孔道、凡農民、建築商、與金屬工人入黔省者、均由該站指導赴貴陽、抵達後、商工則在貴陽近郊開始工作、而農民則送入更遠之</p>
<p>內地墾植</p>
<p>貝克博士由貴陽乘汽車至桂省之柳州與桂林、柳州猶無難民問題、但因難民過境、與醫治空襲時受傷之民衆、故頗形不寗、現由該地敎會從事救濟工作、而縣政府亦協同應付此局勢、桂林急需藥物、傳醫療受傷平民與來自廣州而在道中患病之難民、此外、復有</p>
<p>疾流行</p>
<p>桂林縣政府已擬定遺散難民之計劃、但因缺少基金、此等計劃之實施、乃受阻碍、惟已有若干傳敎士組織一國際救濟委員會、協助使難民情况漸趨寬弛、貝克博士復由廣西至湖南衡陽、見該地敎會、大多杳無人跡、而醫院中之醫生與護士、已於尚可得</p>
<p>運輸便利</p>
<p>之時撤退他去、故裝運給養與撤退平民之運輸事業、實屬急需、現該城中照料傷兵、亦成問題、但縣政府救濟傷者之計劃、仍在實行中、而貝克博士到達長沙時、所見者幾盡　頹垣殘牆、復由零陵出發、搭火車經江西而至浙江、江西亦有瘧疾流行、</p>
<p>傷兵亦多</p>
<p>僅有傳敎士從事少許平民之救濟工作、金華之傳敎士、醫治難民疾病頗忙、但麗水並無難民、溫州之救濟工作、大半爲當地華人救濟委員會所辦理、貝克博士抵溫州後、乃直接返滬、</p>

<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>醫者「慈善爲懷」，醫「有割股之心」，醫「仁衛也」，之數語者，皆頌禱醫者之詞，亦即勗勉醫者之言也。所以　醫者，必先具有仁心，而後可行其仁術。仁者何？慈善是也。故西方有諺曰，「醫無仁心，不可託也。」信然。今則不然，每以慈善事業之醫，作為個人營利之業，甚至江湖星卜，竊名爲醫，背道而馳，以術行詐，混淆世目，惟利是圖，宜乎招人唾駡，淪醫道於塗炭也。於是國家特立法以裁制之，而於熱心服務者，亦得有此保障；舉凡見死不救，借端要挾，無故拒診，過失殺人等等，均爲法律所不許；並限制醫者施用手術，例先徵得病者或家屬之承諾，備具手續，方可療治。吾則即爲違法，而有處　分。防制於微，其義固未可以厚非；然於事實上，則有大相逕庭者。譬如病者需急救，若候其手續備全而施術，則早已錯過治療之時幾。當此時也，以法律立塲，則醫者惟有置之不理，而見死不救，有負慈善之使命，於心何忍？然偶一動手，即為違法，意外之咎，未免呼冤，顧此失彼，將何適從？而為產科醫者，遭遇尤多。蓋分娩障礙，每多卒然而起，不但產婦絕無先覺，即醫亦不能預知，而對於此等障礙之處置，往往急不待緩，於此間不容髮之際，焉復有微求產家同意之餘晷？猶憶前年上海各報，會戰杭州新聞一則，略謂有某婦投住某醫院，當因產事緊急，巳頻於危，某院醫師急爲施用救急手術，而未及辦理手續；後以其他變化而不起，其夫即誣告某院醫師，法庭遂以手　未備之罪名，而科該醫師以罰金，杭州全市醫師，莫不大抱不半，而聯名發表激昂之宜言；常時各地醫帥，未聞有同情之響應。余獨耿耿在胸，迄未或釋，茍不補救，於業務上，必將發生重大困難。即如鄙人所經過者。試舉最近二事以例之：去年某月日，有男女二人，因女臨產，來院投住，當由男子簽立住院保單，繳納院費而去。不意產婦入夜劇痛，至午夜忽起變化，勢非施行手術不可，乃令院役索保單地址邀其男人，詎知該處並無其人，時勢益危，余無奈，乃往街頭招一安南捕，告以實情，請爲證。又今年十二月某日，有某婦深夜隻身來院，扣門甚急，甫入戶，其狀非常狼狽，嗚咽不能言，腹痛不能步，腰屈不能支，即令院役抬入產室啟褲視之，則兒頭已露其頂矣。此情此景，試問誰與辦理法律上之手續，拒之乎，則一髮之繁，生死所關，不但爲人情所不可能，亦爲良心所不能許，幸慶兩全，差告無事，倘或不測，早步杭州某醫師之後塵矣。法律慈善，難全其美，長此以往，將何自保？而業產科者，對於此等卒然而起之　　變化，允較其他醫師遭　爲多，爲保障業務計，更當羣起呼籲，而求一圓滿之解釋。今值上海市醫師公會主辦「新醫與新藥」創刋之期，敢佈區區，用求商討。</p>
<h3 id="c120">通俗醫話　冬春時病之預防 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>時病者何？傳染病也，夏秋之傳染病，以霍亂痢疾爲最著，冬春之傳染病，以流行性感冒爲最著，而猩紅熱·白喉·天花·流行性腦　膜炎等次焉。霍亂痢疾，病在胃腸，能謹防其口，必不至罹病，若夫冬春之傳染病，則皆由空氣而傳染者也，防之甚難。</p>
<p>空氣何以能傳染疾病，以疾病傳染之物質，飛揚於空氣之中，而入火之口眼鼻孔也，如流行性感冒病人之咳嗽噴嚏，所噴出之痰唾細滴，皆含有傳染性物質，若病人周圍之人，吸入此含有傳染性物質之空氣，即被傳染矣。</p>
<p>白喉病人之口鼻腔內分泌物，亦含有傳染性物質，咳嗽嚏唾之時，其危險與流行性感冒無異，且白喉之菌對於乾燥之抵抗力，較爲倔强，附着於枕衾衣帽書籍玩物之面者，一經乾燥，稍爲拂拭，即可隨塵飛揚也。</p>
<p>猩紅熱病人，當其發病之初，口鼻之分泌物，已有傳染之力，故其咳嗽嚏唾，皆能權染，與流行性感冒等無以異。且其皮膚所發之紅疹，傳染力頗强，故猩紅熱病人痊愈之後，皮膚落屑之時，最能傳染於人，一舉手揚袂，而皮膚已飛揚於空氣之中，播毒於周圍矣。</p>
<p>他如流行熱病脊膜炎，如天花，如麻疹，若非空氣中之細滴傳染，即爲空氣中之微塵傳染，總名之爲空氣傳染，非空氣能傳染人，有物附之而行也。</p>
<p>空氣傳染，預防法，其最上之策，則使有菌之病人，入隔離病院也，不但有菌之病人而已，即帶菌之健康人，亦應入隔離所，加以治療，蓋有與病人相接近之人，其自身並未罹病，然口鼻粘膜及衣服表面，往往附帶病菌，以爲傳播之媒介，使人不能注意，此近來傳染病預防上，所以極注重於此等帶菌之人也，又有自身罹病巳愈，而病菌尚未肅淸者，亦能傳播病毒而使人不注意。</p>
<p>然國人習慣，不喜入醫院，且當此緊縮時期，以生活之關繫，不欲長時隔離。所以隔離上策，不能絕對施行。况國人之罹傅染病者，大多數就舊醫診療，而舊醫之頭腦淸楚及有良心者，尚能指示病人以隔離注射等正路，其透心糊塗及天良汨沒者，抵死不肯承認傳染病之爲菌，不甘放病人入科學醫之手，而個人之利害，羣衆之禍福，固非其所顧慮也。</p>
<p>不得已而思其次則惟消極方法，深居簡出而已。但此事亦須有菌帶菌之人，與健康之人共同合作，方能收效於萬一，吾則絕無效力可言。譬如患病之人及帶菌之人，除必要不得已之外，絕對不出門遊玩，不入羣衆集團之中，不訪問親友，即親友來訪者，亦告以理由而不予接見，至於咳嗽之時，談話之頃，則以帕掩口，有痰睡，則入之有蓋或有消毒藥之痰盂中。則庶幾可以减少旁人之貽害，有公德者其愼之！</p>
<p>健康之人，當空氣傳染病盛行之時，亦宜深居簡出，以期减少枉受傳染病之流彈。然閉門家居，而親戚朋友之罹傳染病者，帶菌者，造門相訪，勢不能拒絕，且並未前知來訪者之曾罹傳染病及會在傳染病人之側，雖欲避之而無從也，故非曾患傅染病之人及接近傳染病之人，自守公共道德，不將傳染病之機關槍彈，亂掃健康之人，則不能收效也。</p>
<h3 id="c121">補劑談 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡禹門</p>
<p>我國人之習性，最喜亂吃補劑，允其在隆冬三九之際，以爲不服補劑，非但有妨於延年益壽，幷且一到開春，往往易傷外感，易生各種疾病。此種見解，由來　久。然其所謂補劑者，不出鹿茸·人參·虎骨·驢皮·之屬，亦有臨時開方製成所謂膏滋藥者，此數藥劑，有人服之，尚有少效，然有服此而妨礙消化，反使飮食减少，身體不適。近日余親見一王姓老翁，年七十餘，精神尚矍鑠，步履健捷，聽友人之勸，進鹿茸，速食數天，頓使胃病大發，以是纏綿，竟至不起。故處令日科學之日新月異時代，於身體之應當如何滋養，其缺點應當如何補救，均有一定之準繩，必須參察確實，然後或以飮食物；或用藥劑，校正之，補救之，方可得其利而不受其害。我國最大之弊病，在於人人知醫，而亦可謂在於人人不知醫，見一物或一藥，某一人食之而得益者，即云某人食之而佳，即可任意服用，極力勸人納食，旣不悉其人身體之品質如何，其食物藥餌之功用，是吾與之適宜，是吾爲其所需要，均不求甚解，任意慫恿。此種無常識之舉動，吾見愛人而反致害人者，屢見不一見：甚爲危險，眞所謂盲人騎瞎馬，夜半臨深池。吾人生命，豈同器物，一有誤投，追悔莫及，有識之士，不可不深戒也。</p>
<p>故欲談補劑，第一。必先要知平常吾人身體中所需要者何物；，第二。對於需要物質，體中化學工作不能充分時，應得如何之矯正；第三。在旣有疾病，或身體瘠瘦，非飮食物所得補救也，必詳查其體中所缺者爲何質，何種補樂，方與其適宜，服後可以受其益而不受其害。故在今日之科學上，不談到補劑則已，如談到補劑，非將上述三層，分別淸楚不可，今分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）吾人具七尺之軀，凡是全身細胞之補充，思想動作之泉源，不能不有藉於納取之營養素，人生所需之營養素，簡言之，有蛋白質。炭水化合物。脂肪三種，廣言之，又加水與鹽類，共爲五種。人體組織中細胞之構成，其主要材料爲蛋白質，是以必將蛋白質時時加入，以補充其消耗。又人體生活中其所營思想動作等等，必須時加生熱與力之物質，故炭水化合物與脂肪　營養紫，亦不可不時加補充。水與鹽類，則爲前三者之重要補助品，故亦列入營養素中。營養素之定義旣明，即可藉知每日吾人新陳代謝之所消耗營養素之補充，自有身體內神妙不可思議之化學工作，時時補足其缺損，更無須另求滋補之物質。古人云，藥補不如食補，實合衛生之箴言。故吾人如三餐適宜，而消化力佳良，則身體即可壯實，又何待補劑耶？</p>
<p>（二）如吾人體質，初時甚健，並無他病，或內飮食不依定時，或者不守一定之量，暴飮多食，以致胃腸不能任其勞，而時時發生障礙，在此種情形之下，所進食物，即不能得著營養之力，而致身體消瘦，精力萎頓。此時亦不宜即用補劑，必先治其胃腸，恢復其消化力，使飮食物入體內後，得以完成其補充之作用，則瘠者自腴，面色蒼枯者自然紅潤，體力萎疲者自能奮發，此時若不知回復其消化力，妄投以我國向來稠黏性之滋補劑，無有不反益减損其胃之消化力，而得胃呆之現象。故此時而亂用補劑，非但不能補救，幷且反招損害也。</p>
<p>（三）若身體旣有疾病，或則肺弱，或則血虧，或則腦弱睡眠不酣，或則心弱功能不全心悸亢進；此外如產後病後。以上種種旣各有其疾病之關係，非僅懂普通補劑所得奏效，叉且各人之素質不同，藥房現成製就之劑，宜於甲者未必宜於乙。適於丙者未必適於丁，此時如欲服用補劑，必須注意其於下列三條件，是吾具備。三條件者何？（一）易於吸收，（二）有確實之功效，（三）適應於本人之體質。非然者，非徒耗費金錢</p>

<p>診安　上海市醫師公會啟，甚或反害及身體之健康。總之對於服食補劑，在於一，則因體質本佳無須借助藥力，所謂藥補不如食補也；在於二，則由營養素之消化工作减退老，亦無須乎補劑，止須恢復其消化力，若不謀校正，妄投以不適富之補劑，反有害無利也；三則體弱者如需補劑，必須適合三條件合乎科學原理之藥物，且必更須經醫者之詳細檢查，擇定其適宜之品，始服用之後，得以獲實益，不致徙費金錢也。</p>
<h3 id="c123">病症　流性感冒 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 夏愼初</p>
<p>通俗所謂重傷風者，即流行性感冒也，爲國際的傳染病，或者流行一小地方，成爲局部性地方小流行，或者分散於各地，成爲散在性流行。最近一九二六年至一九二七年，流行於加拿大，一九一八年至一九二二年間，流行於西班牙，當時病勢猖獗，世界震動，稱爲西班牙風邪。在從前當然尚有流行，近來吾上海亦正在流行，然人多不甚注意，以爲傷風非重症，因輕視而延誤者，往往有之，爲特介紹於茲。</p>
<p>原因</p>
<p>本病病原，尚未發見，以前有稱之爲班耳之流行性感冒捍菌者，然據最近之研究，認爲本病之菌體，過於細小，非現有之顯微鏡所能發見云。</p>
<p>本病病原菌之侵入，殆由呼吸器之粘膜，在春秋及冬季發生之，多爲直接傳染。當咳嗽，噴嚏，談話，接吻之時，由分泌物之飛沫，而起傳染，或者由病人之手帕等應用之物，而間接傳染之，本病老小無欺，男女無別，皆能感染，若在大流行時，吾人之感染性，占百分之七十乃至八十。</p>
<p>症狀</p>
<p>一經感染，本病潛伏期，僅一日，多至二三日，突然以一二决之惡寒戰慄而發病，發三十八度乃至四十度之高熱，同時感到疲倦及頭痛，或者背脊腰部及四肢之痠痛，此種痠痛，難以言語形容之。或者尚有嘔吐，胃呆，咽喉腫脹，音嗄及支氣管粘膜炎，或者又有眼結膜炎，熱度或高或低，（她張熱）或者高熱不退，（稽留熱）如此狀態經過快者，三日乃至七日而退熱，稱爲支氣管粘膜炎型流打性感冒</p>
<p>若病勢逐漸加重，由支氣管粘膜炎，進而爲支氣管肺炎。或者發生腦症狀，如意識不淸，甚至昏睡，其症狀極似眞正腦膜炎，亦有頭痛及項强，（將其頭部抬起，則其軀幹亦同時上升之症狀也。）若此者，概爲重症。其結果，多不治。此外，又有神經痛，神經炎，及精神病等者。</p>
<p>流行性感冒，亦有專犯胃腸者，其症狀以嘔吐爲主。此外　有腹痛及腹瀉等。腹部之症狀，重者極似赤痢，或者發生腹膜炎，又有發現黃疸者，稱爲胃腸型流行性感冒，若不在流行之時，此種胃腸型者，難於診斷也。</p>
<p>流行性感冒之最爲可怕者，莫若肺炎，大概在發病之第三四日後發生之。此種肺炎，或者取粘膜炎性肺炎型，或取窒息性肺炎型之經過，脈摶速，呼吸促，咳嗽多，咯痰不易者，必至鼻搧唇暗，此爲肺炎中最危險之現象，不治者居多。幸而得免於死，然在治愈之後，尚有發現支氣管擴張，肺膿瘍，（肺內蓄膿）肺壞疽，（肺之一部腐化）及肋膜炎等之虞，允其因肋膜之蓄膿，而成爲膿胸者，往往有之。</p>
<p>若從前有過肺結核者，允須加以注意，往往因之而惹起其舊病也。流行性感冒之肺炎，亦有以呼吸器症狀之未能消退，或者又有微熱，為時既久，往往誤認爲肺結核者有之。若此者稱為慢性流行性感冒，與慢性支氣管粘膜炎，慢性肺炎，肺結核，化膿性中耳炎，嗜眠性腦炎，神經炎，及精神等，同為併發病，或者為流行性感冒之後遺病。</p>
<p>預後</p>
<p>流打性感冒之結果，其死亡率，大有進出，輕者不過百分之一，重者，惡性者，由百分之十乃至二十。妊婦，老年人，有心臟病，及有肺結核者，其結果多不良。流行時之病原菌之善性惡性，亦大有關係者也。</p>
<p>療法</p>
<p>醫治本病，以安靜爲第一重要，蓋能安靜，則能防止合併症之發生，確有相當之效果，其决，營養飮食物，攝取容易消化者。此外，用濕布圍其胸與頸，頭部用冰袋或冰枕。初起之時，服退熱藥，使其高熱减退一二度者亦可。但最好須遵守醫師之指導，若有肺炎，胃腸型，及腦膜炎等症狀發生之時，各有其適當之處置。病家所當注意者，在退熱之後，尚須臥床數日，且不宜沐浴是也。</p>
<p>預防</p>
<p>本病之預防，甚爲困難，流行之時，宜少出外，允其戲院遊戲塲等，人多而空氣惡劣之處，不宜去，出門之時，最好用口罩，時常用漱口劑漱口，勿與病人接近，允其老年人與兒童，更不宜接近病人。注射預防流行性感冒疫苗，亦有相當功效。</p>

<h3 id="c127">新時代的蝙蝠 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 杲杲</p>
<p>獸勝走入獸羣，鳥勝飛入烏羣的蝙蝠，終因烏獸的構和，而歸於排斥摒棄之列。蝙蝠的聰明，適成其爲蝙蝠的愚笨。</p>
<p>人物隨時代而演進，昔日的蝙蝠的伎倆，當然不能與今日的蝙蝠相提並論。昔日的蝙蝠，視鳥獸鬥爭的勝負，而定飛走的姿態，就拍馬哲學上說來，不但缺乏先幾之智，步人後　，而且始終要露馬脚。現在的蝙蝠，有集團的組織，有分工合作的精神，維持會也是他們，隸屬偽縣政府之下的鄉長鎭長村長也是他們，打家刧舍綁票勒贖的匪徒也是他們，各掛各的招牌，各顯各的能耐。某方面來，由某種蝙蝠去敷衍，某項任務，由某種蝙蝠去辦理，數衍得面面俱到，辦理得實實惠惠。在這戰事期內混亂的局面之中，淪陷區，不，游擊區，是他們的巢穴，是他們的世界。</p>
<p>然而，這種自以爲狡獪的伎倆，畢竟還有破露失敗的時候。第一，被剝削被刧掠的當地遺民，能不怨毒嗎？能不向駐守後方的×軍告發嗎？第二，戰事結束，歷受痛苦的遺民，維持法律人道的地方官，能不向他們淸算賬目嗎？蝙蝠的聰明，適成其蝙蝠的愚笨。</p>
<p>時勢造英雄，蝙蝠又演進了。靠田產活命的田主，不是晨夕盼望着租米嗎？可是不敢到游擊區的農村裹去收取。偽縣政府的官吏，不是很盼望田賦的收入嗎？賦從租出，田主得不到租米當然不能解糧，而這班偽官，又沒有膽量直接到鄕圓去向田甿征收。維待會種種幫派太多，份子複雜，也不敢公然直接向田甿征稅。大家伸長頸巴，垂涎三尺，結果只是畫餅充飢。假使有人惠然顧我，分潤些餅屑，也就心感不盡。在田甿呢，穀稻堆積在塲角上怕被×兵焚燒，碾成　米，藏在家裹，或把米糶了，窰款藏現，怕演出搶刧綁票的　劇；而種田還租是天經地義，不可倖免的事，田主不即收租，只是增加無限的責任與焦慮。蝙蝠看透了多方面的心理，於是，來一個收租代辦處的組織，今年租米幾成，除去手續費幾成，田主凈得幾成分，劃得很明白。所謂手續費者，偽縣政府的田賦，維持會的捐款和蝙蝠目身的酬勞，當然部包括在內。這種辦法，很能根據國際互惠的原則，得到皆大歡喜的結果，眼前收實利，日後無遺患，方法之善，設計之工，當無逾於此者矣。</p>
<p>可是，從抗戰的立塲上着想，他們是以財資敵，爲虎作倀；從地方的元氣上着想，他們維持多方面的勢力，造成永久混亂的局面；除他們自身以外，得到利益與幸福的究竟是誰？王克敏之流所藉以號召的，也不過是國際互惠皆大歡喜而已。</p>
<p>嗚呼！聰明的新時代的蝙蝠。祝你們善自珍重！永永棲息在各縣各鎮吧！看你們苟延到幾時！</p>

<p>自從「大地的女兒」譯成中文後，我們就知道史沫特萊是一個被壓迫者的戰士。在我國抗戰前的救亡運動中，她和宋慶齡等合作，在中國直接參加了民族解放鬥爭，並且主編了一種英文期刊「中國呼聲」，作着抗日的吶喊。在西安事變中，她恰好到了西北，報上說她在主持國際宣傳；無論這消息是吾確實，但我們對她却有了更加深刻的印象。</p>
<p>抗戰開始，八路軍開上了火綫，她也「帶飢帶寒，背上負着傷，」跟着釗普北去。在極端的繁忙和困乏中，寫了些日記信札，這使是現在已經　成中文的「打回老家去　。</p>
<p>這是一冊記載著者在晋北旅途中的見聞和八路軍在抗戰前綫的生活的報告。路易屈郎在緒言中說：「這一部書所以重的緣故，就是因為它評論八路軍第一次在晋北的作戰。道一次作戰產生了中國的新　望新戰術。」這是頗爲中肯的話。</p>
<p>八路軍的成功，是在他們的政治敎育，社會工作和游擊戰術。對於他們的近乎神奇的戰蹟，應該從這幾點的歷史根源和日常生活中去理解。關於前者，「西行漫記」已經追叙得相當精密翔實；也許史沫特萊的「紅軍行進」中也有詳細記載，但我沒有讀過。我們讀了一西行漫記」後冉　讀「打回老家去」，對於八路軍一貫精神的發展，和他們在抗日戰鬥中的牛活，是有了更周到的認識。原來八路軍中的戰士，大都是些鄉下佬，有的還第一决看見火車電影而覺得驚奇，有的竟把整千然而正如緒言中所說，「他們雖然這樣的無知，　有一件事他們知道得很淸楚，就是怎樣團結民衆以抵抗日本侵略者。」他們的物質享受，要比都市中人落後一僩世紀，但是他們的政治理解。實踐精神，那恐怕要比大半的都市中人超過一個世紀哩！</p>
<p>這位美國女記者在那僻野之區跋涉山川，有時甚至和那些戰士們坦然地同睡在馬棚裹面，她的服務和探訪，是歷盡了千辛萬苦，但不是爲圖物質上的報酬，而却是爲着眞理的探求。她記載着八路軍一般的窮苦，但却是愉快，英勇而堅毅！他們慣過窮困的物質牛活，他們軍民上下和協而平等，他們望見了光明的前途而决定地鬥爭着，加以他們戰術的機動靈活，成了他們的屢决勝利以至整個抗戰之最後勝利的重要因素。</p>
<p>史諾在抗戰爆發以後，曾爲西行漫記」續了一個附編，但那是着眼於中日兩方戰鬥力之對比的理論性的文字；從形象地記叙八路軍在抗日前綫活動道一點上說，那末這冊「打回老家去」，也許可以當做「西行漫記」的續編而閱讀罷。</p>
<p>不過，由於她的記述過於倉卒，所以這冊書寫得有點瑣碎而不緊凑，不及「西行漫記　的有系統，有結構。材料也只起自她的出發晋北，止於她南下以前；並且因她沒有達到直上火綫的願望，所以並沒描寫到交戰的偉大塲面。再則書中叙到她私人瑣事的篇幅太多，似乎也是一個瑕疵。這是她朋友代編的，她說將來要「自行編輯一過；希望她在不久，能予以整理補充。</p>
<p>有人說史沫特萊是眞眞的「中國之友」，我認爲這還不大確切，應該說，她是被壓迫國家和民衆的同一陣綫上的戰士。</p>

<p>— 頌圭</p>
<p>冬令的夜是漫長而且沈　的，六點鐘打過了好久，天色還只有濛濛亮，因此×鎭上的市面也開的特別遲。初升的朝暾照到南市梢的關廂（鎭上進口的柵門）時，纔看見有趕市的鄕人一批批地進去。</p>
<p>近來，關廂的開放更顯得戰士特別的遲，並非鎮上人貪安躭睡晏覺，也不是鄉下人有農事不趕　，爲的是關廂口多了一個「擺卡子」的××哨兵，據說是便衣隊混進混出特別多而不得不延遲開放關廂，以便防範的緣故。</p>
<p>南路頭最爲不安穩，防範的程度自然也比較的嚴緊。趕市的鄕下人因爲過「卡子」怕遭麻煩，往往繞道到東面進去。因此這在南關廂「擺卡子」的××哨兵也特別的顯得孤單，除了在陽光中印在地上的自己的影子之外，更沒有別的伴侶了</p>
<p>但這個不禁孤獨之感的××哨兵終於找到朋友來了。他看見面前的石路盡頭有三條人影在閃動，他隨即集中目力去注視，隨即發現在轉角路上截出三個人來，模樣兒也並不覺得古怪。但他似乎也很機警，他立刻覺悟過來這三個人一定對他不懷好意的，理由是這三個人一律穿的大　，而這時期裹使他們吃過大虧的全是穿警這一類大褂的便衣兵。時間並不容他充份的考慮與偵察，這三個人已站在他面前了。</p>
<p>「良……民證？」</p>
<p>這××哨兵運用堅强的舌本發出這沉重的聲音，他猶昂然的作種種欲搜查的姿勢。</p>
<p>「搜啊！」</p>
<p>這三個沒有「良民證」的人以剛直的語氣答覆他的要挾。說時遲那時快，這三件大褂子　然地一齊鈕開，豁然地以京劇中綠林好漢的姿態捺起了各人的大襟子，赫然地每個人的胸前勛章式的掛着一排手溜彈！</p>
<p>這個該死的××哨兵這下子可眞嚇昏了。欲抗拒嗎？寡不敵衆，自己的性命先不保。欲不抗拒嗎？又不明這三個人的來意，恐怕連累了自己部隊的安寗。但這左右不是的理智上的判斷力，終於發惜死的感情作用所克服了，這時他也情不由主的　起了雙手，在顫抖的聲昔裏迸出：</p>
<p>「良民證不……要，不要了！」</p>
<p>「搜啊！」</p>
<p>「不……不敢……。」</p>
<p>「繳鎗！」</p>
<p>這呆若木鷄的××哨兵這纔醒悟過來，他背上的槍不曾拿下，帶着恐怖的眼光，用從頭上放下的手，拿過槍來，復恭敬的獻出去。</p>
<p>這時他們却卸掉了長衣，很敏捷地搜查了××哨兵的身上，搜查了關廂門的內外。當然這回子他們是「不虛此行」的，你看，他們兩個人的肩頭槓着的不是一尊小鋼砲嗎？還有那一個的手裹也不空着，可不是方纔的那枝槍？</p>
<p>至於那個××哨兵呢，依舊孤伶伶的站着那裹。</p>

<h3 id="c132">流亡年餘征塵萬里　孫敏從昆明歸來　　反彈大批影人們的流浪情形 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 幸人</p>
<p>一大羣的電影藝人們，當在淞滬抗戰正極劇烈的漫天烽火中，他們便曾合組「上海影人劇團」，離了上海直去川中：到現在歷時一年有餘，很多人還在那裹度着流亡式的演劇生活。去冬在武漢而使人感到更殷切的懷念。昨天，聽到名演員孫敏，龔稼農兩君，萬里迢迢的剛從昆明回來。爲要探詢這些藝人們的流亡情形，特地跑上孫君家裹，去作一番簡略的訪談。</p>
<p>孫君行裝甫卸，風塵滿面，身上穿着一套舊花呢的西服；大家在見面握手問好之後，他便一手揭起衣襟，顯示着破碎不堪的夾裏笑着道：「這叫做四川衣裳，換句話說，也就是此行飽經苦難的紀念品！」</p>
<p>流亡情形</p>
<p>談及流亡情形：他和白楊，王獻齋，龔稼農，王徵信等一行四十餘人，係於前年就越間同車離滬，到南京乘輪去　，再轉重慶。其間行程歷一個月；在京漢兩地曾經遭逢着好多决的空襲危險，好在大家安然自若，也都沒受及什麼損害。</p>
<p>前年十月下旬到了重慶，當下在國泰戲院表演：「蘆溝橋之戰」「瀋陽之夜」「流民三千萬」「醉生夢死」「漢奸」等劇目歷二十六天，座價共計售得二萬多元，營業成績，雖極美滿。但爲限於合約條件束縛，結果每人祗曾分得酬金一百餘元。原來，這劇團係由四川片商夏某墊款組織！事先訂明辦法，須於售款項下除去旅費，由戲院照拆半數以後，再婦夏某與劇團方面各半分拆，因此各人有名無實，便不免於所得無幾了。</p>
<p>轉往成都</p>
<p>爲了這樣待遇太苛，深表不滿，許多人在重慶演畢之後，便向夏某提起一番交涉。結果，改定了月薪—自四十元起至一百五十元止—的辦法，這才再作成都之行。</p>
<p>那裹的出演情形，也很不錯：第一决「蘆溝橋之戰」運演七天，日夜滿座。接着「流民三千萬」又在熱烈的情况下櫃續上演。不意到第四天上，當地警備司令嚴嘯唬在塲觀劇，忽於表演民衆逐退敵人，幕後現出一輪紅日，以示重見允明的一點上，發生極大悮會，竟說他們頗有反宜傳嫌疑。因即下令封閉戲院，並限各劇人於三日內須得一律出境。各人客居異地，幾爲手足失措，眞是一番意想不到的禍事。</p>
<p>絕大風潮</p>
<p>他們經此風波，隨時根據劇本先經檢准，劇情純爲宣傳救亡等種種理由，再三申說，才得消除悮會，歸於平息。不過在劇團名稱上，終非堅持另改名不可。劇團內部爲此發牛意見，分成了兩個組織。他和王獻齋，馬瘦紅，王徵信，袁竹如，周曼華等男女七人別就他院登臺；其餘白楊，吳茵，謝俊等數十人，改用「成都劇團」名號，仍在原處上演。這　直經演過了三個月，方告結束。他們的七人小劇團又爲戲院欠薪糾紛，在那裹勾留了兩個多月。然後再回重慶，膺聘昆明戲院。那一方面的白楊，趙丹，施超，顧而已等幾位，就在重慶，加入中央攝影塲服務。</p>
<p>昆明之行</p>
<p>本年九月間他們一行七人，了昆明，兩個的演劇生活，同又告期滿。他和壟稼農急於返滬，便從那裹到海防乘輸轉港，先回上海。王獻齋等則爲應邀貴陽戲院，尚須在兩個月以後，始能事畢言旋。</p>
<p>最後，談起後方抗戰情緒：各地軍民一心，極形熱烈。在那樣朝氣蓬勃，抱定「最後勝利，必屬於我」的情形之下，前途確是絕對樂觀，且可斷言，爲期不遠的。</p>

<p>最近一張影片名喚“Me　and　my　Girl”</p>
<p>片子還沒有來上海開映，可是「倫勃斯」（“LambethWalk”）新舞步已經風靡了整個舞市，而大心，卻連續地在這幾天舉行了「倫勃斯」舞步的錦標競賽。</p>
<p>自然，一種簡單的新花樣容易的爲人所愛好，在舞市中，當“The　Lambeth　Walk”音樂起奏以後，舞池裹的男女們就得扯開了掛着歡笑的唇角，喊着「嗨！」「嗨」</p>
<p>人正是意料中那豳擠，在烟，酒，色情的刺激之下，淡紫色的燈光演奏着最濃重超現實的音樂，舞池裹，漸漸地因加添起舞客們的座位而顯得漸次狹小起來了。然而那還不過六七點鐘的時候。</p>
<p>金鏞站在樂隊指揮者愛皮聖託斯面前報告出這一次參加舞賽的舞侶號碼，九十一，九十三，九十四……一百零二。可是有三位缺席棄權。臂上掛上號布，摟着自己挑選的舞伴，有舞女，也有女客，有西裝革履，也有長袍呢鞋，僅僅六七對的比賽，可是花樣很不簡單。</p>
<p>秩序有點亂了，是四週發出俏皮的喝釆和捧塲聲，更必然的是舞池週圍的觀衆排列了一個方城陣。</p>
<p>音樂停了，評判員說；「再來一决」，果然，「九十一」「九十七」二對舞侶比較大方的顯出一些本領來，歡躣，輕鬆，浪漫，風趣的「倫勃斯」舞步，才掀動了一陣然烈的手掌。除了他們還加了二對領獎，其實獎品不過是一束玩具而已，爲了娛樂這興味也許是不太淡薄吧？</p>

<p>— 何培本</p>
<p>天氣一冷，火爐煤是上市了，允共「生來嬬養」的上海人，喫不起熱，也經不起冷，秋季賽馬以後，大家爭先恐後在公館裏裝火爐管子，預備烤火，有的更考究的，像公寓大厦，旅館宿舍，裝起了然水汀，電火爐，富麗堂皇，淸潔非凡，所以：門外儘管落得雨雪紛飛，寒風砭骨，裹面日覺得熱洪烘恍如陽春三月，貧富之隔，眞如天堂地獄。但是：人類享受愈優越，物質上的消耗也愈大，消耗於熱水汀煤火爐由礦質而化爲烏有，年在一十萬噸以上。其中包括烟煤。無烟白煤。塊子。煤屑四五種。銷路以煤屑較大，與塊子的六對四之比，因各實業工廠馬達蒸汽爐及水汀爐子，與煤球原料，均須採用屑子，而其價亦廉，較塊煤每噸相去六七元之譜</p>
<p>前歲一八一三戰事發生：國產煤礦，淪落戰區，交通阻梗，來源絕跡，以致本埠存貨告罄，煤價飛漲，不得不「飲鴆止渴」，採購洋煤，結果仍舊因外滙緊縮，運費品大，成本難以减輕。白煤比戰前高漲四五成，烟煤竟超出加倍有餘，從前：十二三元一噸的開平燜煤屑，現在要買到三十六七元，眞是匪夷所思，意想不到。尤其是可異的，烟煤屑竟比白煤屑來得貴，（頭號鴻基白煤屑每噸祇售廿九元）那眞可說：非常時間的非常行情了。</p>
<p>爲了有道畸形現狀，遂以爲有機可乘，大好發一票洋財。以廿塊錢一噸的二號鴻基白煤屑，及煤球廠的回爐屑，溶和配合，冒充印度烟屑，向各工廠兜售，每噸開價廿八元。橫豎外行人「以耳代目」，祗聽價錢，難分優劣，往往被他一魚目混珠」瞞騙過去，貿然和他成交，五十噸一百噸定了下去，直待應用發覺，可是已「錢落人手」，難以挽回。（聞同業中亦有十餘家受騙）還有一般未曾和他交易的廠家，聽到了這個行情，却火發雷霆，紛紛向老交易的煤號辦交涉，以爲你們開價太大，利息實在抱得太厚了，耍求削價。實在呢：做生意不論「洋人」「華人」，將本就利，「打來駡來，蝕本不來」，天下豈有情願賠本討好買主之商號？實則：都是那般「掛羊頭，賣狗肉」滑頭商人，從中作弊，搗亂市面。而顧客不明，遂起誤會。故特借本刊方寸地，表而出之，甚希煤業當局：加以檢舉證明，工廠用戶；幸弗輕信。否則：一貪賤買老牛，一年倒兩頭」欲便宜而反喫虧了。</p>
<p>外棉價紐約棉市沉寂、各業對棉市均抱觀望態度、期待華盛頓國會對棉花貸款及貸款棉之出售等立法之發展、布疋銷數報告仍良好、開盤時因受賣出壓力而跌、後因同業購進而略回、結果尙昇六七磅音、印度跌三羅比、預測漲一羅比七五、兩扯尙跌一羅比餘、埃及停市、咋日滙兌無甚軒輊、折合法幣、美棉及巴西棉每担漲五角、印棉跌二角餘、</p>
<p>本市外棉交易、連日因紗布暢銷、市面鬆動、昨日棉紗又猛漲二十餘元、本棉火機姚花又創六十七及六十五之新高價、而印度近日價格反降元餘、各華廠因需棉孔　、均忘却外商之苛刻條件、並願付定銀二成、訂購大量外棉昨印棉交易萬餘包、華廠佔三千包、按照目前棉况、外棉之進口數、恐將與日俱增也、前因細絨棉價昂而被巴西棉所佔、現印棉亦將取代短絨棉矣、茲將昨日交易件額及現貨市價分列於後、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、咋日市况初則有堅定的緩緩上翔之趨向、後復見猛烈上騰之新氣象、前週謠言，公債利息發生問題、巳經金融界證實、完全爲子虛烏有、忐忑人心、得以安定、日本新內閣之對華方針、一本舊內閣之固定策略、而吾最高當局、對於在精衛之刺謬言論、寬大爲懷、以冀其改過自新、總合各方形勢觀測、不難得其最近趨勢之崖略、近更以紗花襪金、以及外匯套利等、無機可乘、游資充斥、公債交易、乃更見熱鬧而漸趨繁榮、惜該所未能開市、致市面不能儘量發展耳、昨日匕午、初僅散戶需要較殷、後以潤利號繼起爭購、市價乃拾級而登、午前卽好起一角至四角、午後人氣更旺、各帮熱烈吸收、其中允以某大戶託大豐號代爲補空、爲數甚鉅、漲風突起、竟扶搖直上，市上籌碼頓見枯竭、供求絕對懸殊、再漲一元左右、各種均以當日最高價收盤、甲種又見六十三元三角半最高價、比上月二十四日高價又突過九角半、蓋甲種一則以第七决抽籤期近、且此次抽籤、籤枝驟增至二十八枝、中籤易、人咸趨之、其他各種雖尙未見新高價、但亦相去不遠矣、市况前途、允有樂觀、結果漲一元至一元四角半、成交數的七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<h3 id="c144">金融　人心不定現金價上落倐忽　結果續跌六元 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、起落依然倏忽、純視外滙緊縮及人心爲轉移、初因英純金再度猛落、故漸漸下降至八十元低盤、嗣因錢兌業曁大連帮忽與買意、同時外滙內盤帶軟、因之一度上升、後以金號與銀樓帮供售，頓形回挫唯中途多盤旋、但尙無過大起伏、各方人心不定、全天交易尙稱不寂、</p>
<p>銀樓金號拋售烚赤</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開各方鑒英純金連日猛跌、故稍向下游、因之買戶不前、晨開前做低六元、首由銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩、價一千九百八十五元、後銀樓帮賣意仍濃、故乃繼續下降、銀樓帮售予錢兌業三十兩、價八十二元、此後讓券帮曁錢兌業及大連帮等忽來搜羅、致乃轉向上升、證券帮進銀樓帮五十兩、價八十二元、俄即回吐予大連帮五十兩、價八十六元、繼之錢兌業互做二十兩、價八十五元、其間金號忽來猛售、致價重復下降、金號售予錢兌業五十兩、價八十二元五角、又售予錢兌業三十兩、價八十元、再售予錢兌業四十兩、價八十二元爲午收價午後外滙略緊、致買戶稍抱樂觀、同時售者反形不前、因之價格父告稍堅、先由銀兌業互做三十兩、價八十六元、繼之錢兌業又進金號五十兩，價八十八元、其間金號售意又濃、故價漸漸回挫、金號售予錢兌業數十兩、價八十四元、此後金號中止拋塞、故而再向上升、錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價八十七元、最後錢兌業又進同業五十兩、一千九百八十五元爲晚收價、較上週六午收軋跌六元、全天八元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價一千九百九十五元、收進喊低十五元現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景均無做開</p>
<p>首飾金昨再減一元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金、每兩兌出、初無變更、迨聞烚赤下挫、上午十時十五分一致减低一元、大同行掛二百零一元、新同行一百九十九元、（牧進均的一百九十三元）、</p>
<p>關純金隨英倫慘跌</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國純金（烚赤）收買價、突再猛跌至一千二百十四元六角，掛牌海關金猛跌一分一釐、降至二元四角零一釐、上海標準標金價慘跌五元八角、爲一千二百零九元九角、乃七日倫敦電、英純金傾跌至每盎斯七鎊八先令九辦士半所致云、</p>

<p>上週六英純金續跌八辦士半、英美滙兌續升六二五、外滙供給雖旺、結款甚繁、趨勢微緊、烚赤交易未旺、獲利拋塞者稍盛、市勢微軟、外幣隨外滙微緊而趨升、日金票門市需要甚切價趨堅挺、公會交易旺盛、長泰出永泰進英金票三十鎊、盈豐出同豐進香港票五百元、祥泰出永泰進美金票五百元、鎰康出永泰進英金票三十鎊、勤泰出永泰進美金票五百元、鼎元出永泰進美金票四百元、勤泰出永泰進英金票一百鎊、森泰出元泰進英金票五十鎊、祥源出通源進香港票四百元、承泰出利通進英金票一百鎊、昨日市價、英金鎊升一角、英金票升六分、美金票升五厘、香港票升四厘、法郎票升一厘、坎拿大票升三分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>

<p>滙市昨以英金鎊經當局維護後繼續堅挺、而英美間匯兌漲風未息、故局勢續告英緊美乎、中途因美孚火油公司傾扒、兼銀行供給不爽、而納量殊旺、更以外電香港等亦拋塞不殷、是以情勢遂由鬆而趨軟化、卒以英商沙遜吐售、錢兌業賣意亦濃、致由緊回平、日洋行忽來活動、下午復軟、全日交易頗旺、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條過遠皆縮、紐約現貨勿動、倫敦生金慘落八辦士半、滙兌英對美漲二五、對法大七生丁、對滬如舊、美對英亦升六二五、對法長三七五、對滬昂二角半、中央掛牌各睡、呆定如舊、銀行早開現貨賣價英匯八辦士五一五六二五、美匯十六元六二五、較上週六英鬆〇一五六二五、美硬〇六二五、開後因港電與沙遜等聯袂吐出、故情况會稍趨鬆、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉縮一分、此後因美孚油公司結款頓繁、加以銀行賣意淸淡、而吸胃較健、致潛勢頓形轉緊、英金步軟至八辦士四六八七五、美金十六元五三一二五、繼之外電忽起拋出沙遜亦有供意、銀行賣意、因之稍佳、趨勢漸見轉硬、且錢兌業拋出英美金票與港匯、頭寸充裕、港匯會長至五十七元一二五、午刻市况轉平、英金爲八辦士半、美金十六元五六二五、</p>
<p>後市因外電香港等拋售不湧、需洋商各銀行吃胃突旺、日行亦來扒進、致頭寸一時求過於供、故狀况益趨軟化、英金退入八辦士半內、。但港滙仍五十七元、厥後成交漸稀、於是過程乃稍平定、晚收銀行賣價英滙八辦士四八四三七五、美匯十六元五三一二五、結果比上週六英緊〇一五六二五、美無榮辱、茲將一天做開交易</p>

<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、在跌不止、每千元之貼率已跌至三十元大關內、交換所亦巳抑低至三十元、詢因中國雖有戰事、金融良好如故、對外匯兌穩定、扒結外滙者日少、且放出法幣起收公債者衆多、致現鈔充斥逾恒所致、昨晨初尙穩定、旋聞交換所之貼現率再度减低、因之人心愈疲、供者集中、價遂傾跌至二十五元最低盤、午刻稍回上至二十六元左右、下午見低、梢有收吸、且供方因價過低觀望、致續回上、最後二十九元、而較上週六竟冉軋跌三元半、</p>

<p>物極必反，理所當然。適猶不及，弊病則一。中國婦女被禁錮在家庭裏　　中已數千年了。今一旦解放，有一部分受舊禮教的遺毒過深，積重難返，雖在此新潮流中仍羞於見人，將如何能與人講交際談戀愛？更有因受舊禮教的壓束，致身心上患有暗疾，不配與人講交際談戀愛？此外就是一反前非的時髦女子了。</p>
<p>她們蜷其頭髪，高其足跟，粉其面頰，紅其嘴唇……　入舞場歌榭，茶樓酒肆……無往而不與人講交際談戀愛，朝秦暮楚，人盡可夫……此種女性，如果有丈夫，豈不發生着家庭的問題？至於男子也有同樣的情形，最普遍的矛盾現象，既需要時髦的女性做妻子，而自己仍有舊禮教的觀念想在家庭裏操着夫權。誠然，在宗法社會裏家庭中的夫權是高於一切的，妻子稱夫為「天」，而夫視妻如「奴」，然在今日已解放了的時髦妻子那怎麼能行呢？因此家庭就多故了。</p>
<p>我們為解決當今一般家庭的糾紛起見。如果舊禮教在婚姻上家庭裏的陳腐勢力必欲打倒，那新的家庭基礎之夫婦間的愛情，就得確立起來。有此鞏固的新的基礎建築，快樂家庭才能組成。愛情也是髙於一切的家庭問任何糾紛都可用愛情來解決，同時夫婦間的愛情猶苗床裏的種子，是很容易培植的。因為天賦它有生長的能力，我們只要時常的注意灌溉與施肥，是很容易繁榮滋長的。不過關於愛情最根本的問題，就是夫婦兩造的體質。只要男强女健，那很容易引進他們到愛的天國，鶼鶼鰈鰈的過着甜蜜的生活，你為我而我亦為你地努力着奔赴共同的前程，這是多麼幸福而光榮呀！要是男女有一方受舊禮教的貽毒，或因早年的自　與荒淫之故，致性機能衰弱，男的爆發着遺精滑精，賢虧無能，發育不全，神經衰弱等症，女的患月經不調，白帶不感，乳痛顏衰等症，即必須設法治愈。如因循苟且，不以為事，那不特影響於夫婦間的愛情，致發生家庭糾紛且病勢蔓延，衰弱及於全體，更有生命之憂。所以必須及早醫治才好。特效療法，即必須購服生殖腺素製劑「生殖腺」（藥分男女兩用，各藥房均售）於服後一日夜間即能生精補健腦活血，有病治病，無病强身。尤最奇特者，女的服女用「生殖素」後，不特疾病治愈，更可使乳峯發育面頰紅潤，增進健美。惟男子有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以鞏固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速！此項藥品，均經歐美名醫如（Kamdoring）康特靈氏等的化騐證明，認為品質最純粹，效力最確實而偉大，所以早已風行全球而譽滿天下了。余亦曾以此藥對國人之體格是否相宜作過精密而長期之實騐，深覺對於國人亦極相宜，而治療上述各種性病，確具特效，統計凡來本診所就診，或通函指服此項藥品以自療獲愈者，已不下數萬人云。</p>

<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>一生事業所關幸福所聚的重要關頭，無疑的要算由童年進入春情發動期的黃金時代了。在這個時代裏的青年，從一方面說，他們正似初生之犢不畏虎，一切均覺得最有勇氣最有進步，但從另一方面說，卻也最覺得危險最可怕！因為這時期的青年，往往血氣未定，意志薄弱，一被外界誘惑，極易陷入泥淖。而致不可救藥。現在姑置學術事業大題目不談，而僅說健康，也有很多很多的青年，或因自身賀爾蒙的刺　，或被好奇心所引動，或愛環境的挑逗，把不定主意，顧不了厲害，而竟大胆的犯上手淫。</p>
<p>手淫這樣惡習，說起來雖很簡單而可鄙，但是青年一經破戒沾弄，極易成為習慣，習慣既成，於是正似吸烟上了癮，雖知其害而終不能澈底根除，因其不能澈底根除由是青春腺首受摧殘，精關鬆弛，便有遺精滑精，頭暈眼花，神思昏倦，記憶不良等現象，如更放任不治，則精液因大量的流失，賢虧無能，發育不全，睪丸萎縮等症必難倖免，於是青年固有的健康與天賦機能完全喪失，而他一生的偉大事業與甜蜜幸福，也就此摧毀無餘！</p>
<p>然而已有上述不幸的青年，將如何以謀補救？余曰：可藉生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」之藥力，不能如願以償，因「生殖素」係採取雄壯動物的生殖腺精華所製，所以服後能源源不斷地將新的精力供給吾人，造成强健的禮魄，完整的生殖機能，前述各症，自可根治，唯遺精一症，由於精關使用過劇所生，非從事滋補所能治，宜戒絕惡習，兼服固精名藥『希米脫氏固精片』，自可完全恢復射精的控制力，惟患者如在本埠，則最好前來本診所施用「迭門氏」電療機電療，那麼收效尤為迅速。</p>
<h3 id="c161">健美　面容　乳峯　臀部　健美法 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>怎樣算是美？這是根據各人審美觀念而決定的。所以常有甲認為美而乙認為不美，乙認為美而甲又認為不美的事實，但這不過是大同而小異。現代的人，斷沒有再認「三寸金蓮」一步一搖的病態女子為美女了。所以審美的觀念也是跟着時代潮流而轉移的。</p>
<p>時代對於女性審美的觀念，已着重女性特徵發達的健康美了。這是合乎生活的要求，生理的原理的。女性的特徵，不外為面容，乳峯，臀部三者，尤為乳峯為女性特徵美中的主要部分，因為乳峯的發育是必要根據於卵巢機能的。如果卵巢機能健全，乳峯必然非常發達，呈飽滿而有彈性現象，同時臀部的發育亦必健全，上下相稱，就構成女性身體上有說不出奧妙的曲線美。如果穿着蟬翼輕衫，這種曲線美由苗條而活潑的體態上流露出來，這是何等勾人的靈魂。此外因為卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用亦必旺盛，因此，無論在皮膚肌肉與血液中，均充滿着新的細胞。是以面頰自然紅潤，皮膚自然白嫩……無須脂粉，自然的健美要勝過於人工的萬倍。然而事實上一般婦女，因受禮教的壓束或在春情發動期的自瀆與婚後荒淫之故，卵巢機能受其摧殘，更因月經不調，白帶不感，等暗疾的影響，致卵巢機能衰弱，是以即呈乳　顏衰，或更不娠，此種女性，不特不為丈夫所喜，陷於最悲慘的命運，而其自身亦因暗病纒繞，而痛苦不堪！但此種現象並非是不治之症，唯一辦法，即服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，則即可加强卵巢機能，增進新陳代謝作用，上述各症不特可以消滅於無形，並且可以自然地使面容，乳峯，臀部等增進健美，那末，乳　顏衰女性的塗脂抹粉，這是何等愚昧的舉動！</p>

<p>— 力士</p>
<p>便宜是人人所愛的，尤其是中國人，不僅愛便宜，而且貪便宜。</p>
<p>愛便宜原是人類的天性，無可厚非的，然而貪便宜卻是認識不足所造成的錯誤心理，那是要不得的。</p>
<p>便宜有真的，也有假的。合乎主觀的條件，客觀的需要，繼是真便宜，反之，便是假便宜。貪假便宜的結果，卻是吃真虧。</p>
<p>中國人在商業行為上好像最會貪便宜，製造商因為購買者的愛便宜，便偷工減料，在成本上貪便宜，購買者因為經濟能力的薄弱，和便宜形態的誘惑，也就更貪便宜。前者為着「轉快利鈿多」，後者為着緊縮生活，其情其景，容有可原；但實際結果，雙方都吃大虧。製造商因而喪失名譽者，比比皆是；購買者因而損失物質者，亦在在都有；真是兩不合算。而且這種現象，更被經濟侵略者作為進攻的路綫。</p>
<p>他們為要完成獨佔中國的迷夢，過去若干年間，便以經濟侵略政策為先鋒，以大量的質料低劣的貨物，運來貶價傾銷，藉此榨取中國人民的膏血；一般商人祇圖牟利，更是助桀為虐拼命替它銷售，一般民眾也衹顧貪小便宜，爭相購買；這種貪便宜的心理和行為，不料竟招今日被屠殺，被燒燬，被姦淫，被擄掠的慘果。言念及此，彌足痛心！</p>
<p>最近，國民政府因鑒於長期抗戰，方興未艾，端賴舉國上下，一心一德，共體時艱，以挽狂瀾，因此通飭全國人民，嗣後應節約救難，倡用國貨，務使利不外溢，致損國本。這是在抗戰中心要的措施，也是在抗戰中中國同胞應有的認識。要倡用國貨，唯一的要求，還是希望一般同胞根除貪便宜的心理。</p>
<p>諺云：「吃虧便是便宜」，那麼便宜該是吃虧了。何況在敵人的刺刀尖上討便宜，將蒙殺身之禍呢！</p>
<h3 id="c164">「大總日」在上海 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>「男大需婚，女大當嫁」這是古之「明訓」，所以凡為父母的對於子女的「婚姻大事」，都是非常鄭重其實的。不但要「門當戶對」，即是「八字」也要在灶君菩薩前壓上三天，再請瞎子先生算過凶吉。這是訂婚手續。結婚的日子，自然更要選擇一個無沖尅的「吉日良辰」；但是，或許是「吉日良辰」的難求，凡是逢到黃曆上的「長埭頭」，（故鄉有鄉下人看曆本看長埭頭的俗語）男婚女嫁的就都擠在這一天。這現象在內地是普遍得很，在上海，卻要感到困難。上海是「寸金之地」，這是大家知道的，或一間前樓，即是二房東寬宏大量，還把公用的客堂留着，但在這間小的客堂里，逢時逢節，祭祀祖宗則還可以，要擺上數十席喜筵做喜事，實在是沒有辦法的。於是，在這「吉日良辰」的「大總日」，上海的每一家旅館和酒樓，都高懸「客滿」之牌，尤其是成了「孤島」之後。</p>
<p>據一家大酒樓的經理先生告訴我，像他們這樣三層大廈，前廳的大酒樓，在平時實在冷落得很，即使有十幾席酒筵，在一般小酒樓中，好像已經應接不暇了，在他們，還覺得冷清清的，一些也沒有然鬧的氣象。然而一到「大總日」，上上下下，座無隊地，還是不夠分配，把主顧婉言拒絕。如果把「大總日」的生意，能夠平均分開來的話，在上海開酒樓是決沒有不賺錢的。現在各酒樓的附設「小吃部」，一方面果然是為了主顧的需要，另一方面也使那些空餘的日子，不致十分冷落，毫無生氣的樣子；而且，至少可以賺幾個錢，補償空房租。</p>
<p>至於租賃旅館結婚，則因為禮堂沒有像酒樓那樣多，禮堂要及早預定，有的甚至在一年前預定的。現在正是冬春之交，是中國人的結婚季節，逢到「大總日」，那一家酒樓，旅館門口不是擁着密密的燈籠，擠着做喜事的人家呢？</p>
<p>結婚果然是「人生大事」，但是結婚要如此舖張，浪費，有的甚至借了債來撐這空場面，似乎是不必要的。市政府的提倡集團結婚就是使市民以最低的費用，舉行最隆重的結婚典禮。但是，「吉日良辰」的習俗果然是打破了，而參加集團結婚的還是要來一次大張筵席，「場面」之為害大矣哉！</p>
<p>抗戰既興，各方高呼着節約救難的時候，我們確實見過刊登幾行結婚啟事的，或將筵席費用損濟難民的，但是，數千年來相傳的習俗終究沒有完全打破，一個「大總日」的　費，不知是怎樣一個龐大的數目呢！</p>
<p>別再泥於迷信，空撐場面，「匈奴不滅，何以家為」！</p>

<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>福斯公司出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>當我告訴你這部「三騎士」（Straight,　Place　and　Show）是李滋三兄弟所主演的，我想，我用不到再向你解釋：這部影片是一部怎樣性質的東西。</p>
<p>我不知道你歡喜不歡喜他們的胡鬧？如我，我是不歡喜的。當然，因為我們的生活環境和性格的不同，也許，我們在趣味上也會有分別。例如坐在我旁邊的一位大肚子的洋先生，他在看「三騎士」的時候就笑過幾次，而我，卻感不到有可笑的地方。笑的原因是複雜的：覺得自己比對方高明，因而覺得對方醜態百出，便笑了，這是原因之一；然而這高明之感還須是趣味相投才會有，不然，那種裝腔作勢的動作，是衹會引起惡感來的。</p>
<p>我不知道你的趣味如何？所以也無從斷定你看了「三騎士」之後會不會發笑，（如果看得多了，千遍一律，你的笑也會厭倦的）不過，有一點在我們卻是同樣的：當我們踏出了戲院的門口，給冷風一吹，頭腦一清醒，笑過去了，　下的便覺得無謂。於是，我們便不禁想起以前看過的那些意味深長，有骨子的戲來。</p>
<p>自然，還得有例外，例如你本來就以看馬戲班裏的小丑打滾甩虎跳為滿足。</p>
<p>哦，也許你以為我講開去了，你想知道一點這部「三騎士」的內容怎樣？</p>
<p>要說內容，「三騎士」簡直是可以說沒有的，（你當然知道「內容」二個字的真正含義是什麼）像算術加法一樣，有的衹是素材的疊加，而加起來的故事，情理好像也可以不顧。</p>
<p>如果要我報告你一點這個片子的素材，那麼我可以報告你，這裏面有對跑馬的狂熱，以及不知由來的兩支歌唱（那是因為伊色爾梅曼會得歌唱的緣故），和莫名其妙的拳鬥，再有，那就是李滋兄弟的那一套誇張得無可再誇張的動作－－看家本領了。至於李滋兄弟的馬上技術，那卻並不高明，你對電影的製作如果有點基本常識，你是看得出這裏面不是假手於攝影技術，便是靠替身來代替的。</p>

<p>第一回　獨臂翁組織自由村　雙胞女禮瞻先烈墓</p>
<p>那時朱愛人雖然知道自己的祖父，已經斷了一臂，然而人還健在。殘廢不能說不是殘廢了，但這卻是一種榮譽的創傷。她的母親，卻還是一個老農婦，而且身體健碩。並不因為女兒是個西洋留學生，塗了金回來，她要搭出什麼老太太的架子來。她說不定到了農忙的時候，也可以脫了襪子，仍舊可以赤腳下田。不過現在中國的農業也改進了，有許多地方已經改用了機器，農人們的勞動力，已經減輕了不少。不過這位太太，有人勸她不要下田時，她便要直嚷起來道：「為什麼呢？難道種田是坍台的嗎？」朱愛人也時常回到自由村來，看望她的祖父和母親，一個月裏，總要來一兩次，她看了自由村一天天發展起來，當然也很高興。因為這個新村，是她祖父精心　盡起來。雖然有許多人的幫忙，方能像這樣的欣欣向榮。可是她祖父，好像是一村之主模樣。她祖父不但是自由村小學校的校長，而且是自由村的村長呢？我今且說自從朱愛人美國回來，未到兩年的時候，便有兩位女同學，到醫院裏來訪她。那兩位女同學，她們在美國的時候，和朱愛人都是十分親愛的。而且在一個大學裏畢業的時期也相同。不過朱愛人習的是醫學，她們兩人習的是工藝罷了。他們在美國畢業以後，又同到歐洲各國去游歷了一周，然後一同回國。朱愛人回到江蘇的故鄉來，她們也回到廣東原籍去了。原來這兩位女同學，都姓何，是個雙胞胎，今年都是二十二歲。一個喚做何雙玉，一個喚做何儷玉。要問誰是姊？誰是妹呢？　在分不出來。因為從前對於雙胞胎，曾有兩種說法：凡是先出母胎的為兄為姊，後出母胎的為弟為妹。另有一種是說，先出母胎的是弟妹，後出母胎的為兄姊，因為後出者，成胎在先呢。其實這也不過相差在數十分鍾或至數十秒鍾之　，分什麼先後呢？就像那何家姊妹，她們怎能分是何大小姐，何二小姐呢？只能一位喚她雙玉小姐，一位喚他儷玉小姐咧。　（九）</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong counter-offensive military against Guangzhou is now being reorganized. Yu Hanmou has been officially announced as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route, Wu Qiqing as the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route, and Xia Wei as the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route. All units are encircling Guangzhou. A large-scale offensive will commence after coordinated action is achieved. German advisors serving in China are optimistic about the South China counter-offensive military situation. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Japanese troops in Guangzhou, Sanshui, Jiujiang, and Dongguan are extremely apprehensive due to the three-pronged Chinese encirclement of Guangzhou. They are all shortening their lines to attempt resistance. Simultaneously, they plan to abandon Shilong and Shitan, concentrating their forces in Dongguan Humen to guard the gateway to the Pearl River. Ultimately, if necessary, they will abandon Humen, relying on the navy to invade Guangxi from the West River, or land from Beihai. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qujiang: Five thousand Japanese troops are in Humen. On the morning of the 1st, Chinese guerrillas advanced into Huanggang, intercepting towards the Taipingjian of Humen. (8th Telegram)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, Chinese troops in the Northeast and Two Rivers continued to advance yesterday. Chinese troops who recovered Zengcheng have advanced fifteen kilometers and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese troops near Fuhuo Xu. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, Chinese troops in the North River have approached Jinhe Xu and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese troops.

It is claimed that Chinese troops charged into Zengcheng Shumen on the evening of the 5th, immediately engaging in fierce street fighting with Japanese troops. By the evening of the 6th, Zengcheng was definitively recovered. In this battle, the Japanese suffered nearly a thousand casualties. (9th Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: Japanese troops near Conghua Taipingchang have recently increased to 500 infantry and two companies of field artillery, stationed outside Taihe City, constructing fortifications to defend against Chinese attacks. Furthermore, over 500 men from the 22nd Division of the Japanese Army arrived in Guangdong on the 3rd to reinforce Zengcheng. Many of the soldiers in this unit are from the Northeast and Korean籍. During the landing, some who were weary of war were arrested, later all being killed. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>Guilin: The night before, a certain Chinese Brigade's assault troops attacked the Qitou store in Zengcheng. The Japanese resisted with fortifications, fighting until about 20:00. The Chinese surrounded the Qitou store. Furthermore, a Chinese unit broke into the north gate of Zengcheng, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese until the next morning. The Japanese received reinforcements from Shitan Guangzhou. The Chinese unit retreated to its original defense after achieving its mission. In this battle, the Qitou store area suffered over 90 Japanese casualties, and over 20 rifles and many steel helmets and gas masks were captured.

<p>(Hong Kong) At present, the war situation in Guangdong Province is tighter in the West River. Several Japanese motorboats, loaded with a team of soldiers, fiercely attacked the Chinese defenders of Houjian, between Sanshui and Zhaoqing, under the cover of aircraft yesterday. The defending soldiers bravely resisted, and after five hours of intense fighting, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and retreated in defeat. The Japanese suffered considerable casualties and lost eight motorboats. The Japanese troops at Makou, under the cover of intense artillery fire, attacked Jinli yesterday. The Chinese army responded calmly and the Japanese army has not succeeded so far.

<p>Sihui: Several hundred Japanese troops in Makou, under the cover of Japanese naval gunfire, invaded Jinli up the West River at about 10:00 a.m. on the 8th. Chinese defense forces and self-defense teams calmly resisted, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese with machine guns and small mortars. The Japanese were unable to land and retreated in embarrassment.

<h3 id="e4">Wang Jingwei Arbitrarily Spreads Rumors, Falsely Accusing Chairman Chiang of Accepting Japanese Conditions, Zhang Fakui and Others Demand Arrest and Execution <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Official circles here have not yet received the full text of the letter published by Wang Jingwei in Hong Kong last night, so there is no comment for the time being. The government has already clarified its views in the declaration issued on New Year's Day, vehemently condemning Wang's "peace movement" as a complete violation of party discipline, so whether there will be any criticism of this letter is also unknown. However, according to reliable sources obtained by Reuters, Wang's claim that Chairman Chiang had accepted the Japanese conditions submitted by the German ambassador as a basis for negotiation before the fall of Nanjing is completely untrue. At that time, the Chinese authorities requested a detailed explanation because the Japanese conditions were quite unclear. This step cannot be considered an action to accept the conditions as a basis for negotiation. Later, because Japan changed its conditions, Chairman Chiang never mentioned the matter again. As for Wang's statement that the assistance of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France cannot affect the outcome of the war, it only shows that Wang is indeed a "defeatist." Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Wang has always held a pessimistic attitude towards the future of China's resistance. This attitude has aroused extremely deep-seated aversion among the generals at the front. It is reported that several people are now requesting the arrest of Wang and his execution, but the highest authorities still believe that Wang will eventually retract his advocacy of peace talks, so the most激烈電文 issued by some generals has been prohibited from being published. People here believe that Wang will not attempt to negotiate with Japan or join the "puppet regime" established by the Japanese. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangzhou external news, Wang's peace movement seems to have been temporarily shelved after its failure. It is reported that Zeng Zhongming held formal talks with certain personnel in Hanoi on the 9th. Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Mei Siping and others had a meeting in Hong Kong yesterday. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Kuomintang does not attach importance to Wang's letter to Chiang, because all of Wang's current actions are private actions and have no connection with China. Chairman Chiang's headquarters has not yet received the letter. A Chinese spokesman said that this decision is the same as the report published by the Tongmeng Society and the previous report that he will participate in the puppet government, and it is considered that there is no connection. None of Wang's former confidants have been arrested, and all the rumors are rumors. (9th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi telegraphed compatriots at home and abroad on the 5th, saying that Wang Zhaoming has betrayed the party and the country, and has spoken for the enemy. The Central Standing Committee has given him the punishment of permanent expulsion from the party, and the National Government has removed him from all positions held concurrently. Now the people of the country are unanimously denouncing him, vowing not to coexist with this traitor to the nation. This army has also appealed to the Central Government to issue an arrest warrant to maintain national law and benefit the war of resistance. This is hereby telegraphed, respectfully hoping for your attention. (8th Telegram)</p>
<p>Lian County: Zhang Fakui and Yu Hanmou led all the officers and soldiers of the first battle zone and telegraphed the Central National Government on the 5th from the front line, saying that they had just read the resolution of the Provisional Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee regarding Wang Zhaoming's violation of discipline, endangering the party and the country, permanent expulsion from the party, and removal from all positions. Punishing traitors, Fakui and Hanmou humbly lead all the officers and soldiers of the first battle zone to pledge their utmost sincerity and absolute support for the resolution. Zhaoming shamelessly telegraphed and stated his fallacious views on the proposals to the Central Government, being drunk and speaking for the enemy. All officers and soldiers are filled with righteous indignation and believe that, as Wang Zhaoming said, not only is he willing to give up lost territory, break up unity, and ruin the economy, but he is also making wild statements in his telegram, obstructing the war of resistance and blurring the lines between right and wrong. Judging from his actions, he is simply using the pretext of peace to achieve his private desire for open surrender. At this time when the whole country is unanimously determined to fight to the death, the enemy's momentum is declining, and victory is within reach, Wang Zhaoming is losing his mind and recognizing the enemy as a friend, disregarding the loss of hundreds of thousands of miles of land, the injuries and deaths of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the sacrifices of millions of people, and the loss of tens of millions of properties, which are not enough to change his personal dream of wealth and glory. Summarizing his vile behavior of stealing fame and losing integrity, his crimes of betraying the country and the party, even adding 寸磔, would not be enough to cover up his guilt. All the officers and soldiers here humbly believe that the central government's punishment of Zhaoming with only permanent expulsion from the party and removal from all positions seems to be still too lenient. We propose to your seat to further propose to the central government that Zhaoming's surrender to the enemy and betrayal of the country should be ordered by the National Government to be arrested and brought to justice, and to correct the canon and invigorate morale. We have tried this, and we respectfully ask to express the same righteous indignation and unanimous advocacy, so that the traitors who surrender to the enemy and sell the country cannot escape punishment. This is what we pray for. (6th Telegram)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Changsha Telegram, Xue Yue discussed on the 9th his belief that the Japanese would concentrate their forces to prepare to invade western Guangxi, and cited the reasons for the silence on the Yangtze front: (1) Hunan and Jiangxi have built strong defensive works in the Mufu Mountains, naval operations in Poyang and Dongting Lakes are hampered by low water levels, and only one railway and highway each connect Wuchang Changsha and Jiujiang Nanchang; (2) The Xiqiang River and the Mishui River west into Dongting, and the river east into Duyang, creating a natural defense line between Hunan and Jiangxi; (3) The Mufu Mountains have endless small mountains and trees as a formidable defense. If the Japanese advance south from Wuchang Jiujiang, they will suffer heavy casualties; (4) Before attacking Nanchang Changsha, the Japanese must have four new divisions. Xue finally suggested that in the future, China should concentrate its military, political, and economic power and implement an eastward advance, which will be able to achieve the results of 瓤造 and truly implement a sustained war of resistance.

<h3 id="e15">On "Anti-Communism" <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei's telegram of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country has long been abandoned by the people of the whole country. This newspaper has also repeatedly written articles to refute it. Unexpectedly, according to yesterday's newspaper, Wang has recently spread rumors in Hong Kong, confusing the public, and especially emphasized the "anti-communist" point to confuse people's minds, damage the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and alienate the unity of the Chinese people. His ill intentions are truly hateful. Therefore, we do not hesitate to elaborate and discuss the "anti-communism" point again to correct public opinion.</p>
<p>The so-called "joint anti-communism" is to force China to join the "Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact." Therefore, first, we must understand what the essence of anti-communism is. If we join this pact, will it be beneficial to China?</p>
<p>We can answer directly in one sentence: the Anti-Comintern Pact is a "confounding right and wrong" conspiracy of fascist aggressors. It is their hypocritical guise to cover up their aggression. The famous British political commentator, Gottman, once gave a good explanation of this:</p>
<p>The line of aggression, by raising the "communist bogeyman," can confuse the formidable enemies in the democratic capitalist countries, and many liberals have been confused by it. If these liberals had not been blinded by the fascist anti-communist smoke, they would have opposed aggression long ago.</p>
<p>The aggressors took advantage of this weakness of the democratic countries to carry out their aggression under the smoke screen of "anti-communism." The German-Italian joint attack on Spain was said to be "anti-communism"; Hitler's seizure of Austria and dismemberment of Czechoslovakia was said to be "anti-communism"; the Japanese warlords' large-scale invasion of the Republic of China based on the Three People's Principles was also said to be "anti-communism"! If it is anti-communism, why don't the brown-shirted troops march towards Moscow, but instead "pick on the weak to bully"? If it is anti-communism, the Zhanggufeng conflict should be a very good opportunity to fight against communism. Why did the Japanese warlords turn back? Seen in this way, although the "Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact" is under the guise of "anti-communism," it is actually an organized attack on democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. Not long ago, it was widely rumored that a military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy was about to be signed, and this alliance was more clearly aimed at Britain, the United States, and France. In a nutshell, the Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact is an alliance of aggression. China is a victim of aggression. May I ask if China is willing to cast itself into a net and become a vassal of the aggressors? This is one point. Furthermore, the foundation of China's nation-building is the Three People's Principles, and the spirit of the Three People's Principles lies in the realization of democratic politics. Joining the fascist "Anti-Comintern Pact" is tantamount to abolishing the Three People's Principles and abolishing the Kuomintang. Again, the Anti-Comintern Pact not only makes the Soviet Union its enemy, but also makes democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France the target of its attacks. Today, it is the Soviet Union and countries such as Britain, the United States, and France that are helping China resist Japan. Joining the "Anti-Comintern Pact" is tantamount to "recognizing a thief as one's father" and severing ties with friends. The above points are all based on external relations. Secondly, in terms of internal relations, everyone knows that cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the foundation of today's national united front for China's war of resistance and the greatest guarantee for China's war of resistance to achieve final victory. The painful experience of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party over the past ten years has created an opportunity for Japanese imperialism to invade, making the survival of the Chinese nation a problem. Now, they have finally resolutely abandoned their previous grievances and cooperated closely to save China's independence and survival. Today, no one can deny the fact that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party stand together like brothers. Today, the Chinese Communist Party has obviously changed its revolutionary policy and is striving for a China based on the Three People's Principles. The Chinese Communist Party's loyalty to the war of resistance is recognized even by the Japanese. This can be proved by the profound hatred of Japanese imperialism and traitors for the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Since cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has become a huge force to prevent Japanese imperialism from invading, Japanese warlords and traitors will naturally do everything possible to destroy it. They took advantage of the prejudices of some people to spread many rumors about friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in an attempt to break up their unity. "Anti-communism" has become a false guise for traitors to sell the country today, and has become a synonym for Japanese warlords to destroy China. The Chinese people should pay great attention to this point.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, the people of China must use all their strength to support the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and must deeply understand Mr. Sun Yat-sen's announcement in the second year of the Republic of China: "It is not necessary to ask about the size of the party's power, but only to ask whether the policies advocated by our party and its usual actions are in line with public reason and whether they are in line with the times. If the policies are just, upright, and clear, and they are approved by the general public, even with thousands of difficulties and setbacks, we can expect the final victory. As for other parties, in addition to discussing political views, all emotional disputes are not only unnecessary, but also enough to damage the honor of the political party."</p>
<p>As long as the Chinese people sincerely support the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, all the conspiracies of the enemies and traitors will be useless; as long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can strengthen cooperation, the national anti-Japanese united front will inevitably become more and more consolidated, and China's war of resistance will inevitably achieve the final victory.</p>

<p>(Chongqing) On the 9th, Ho Ying-chin reported at the Central Memorial Week (on firming up the belief that victory in the War of Resistance is certain and nation-building will surely succeed). The content was divided into: 1. Reorganization of the army; 2. Replenishment of soldiers; 3. Construction of ordnance and various military industries; 4. Improvement of personnel management and education and training systems. He stated that due to the gradual improvement of the quality of the army, the gradual replenishment of weapons and equipment, and the genuine unification of personnel management and education and training, our national army is becoming stronger as it fights. The enemy, due to the difficulty of a quick victory and quick resolution, has suffered a great blow to its morale. Its military expenditure requires 3 trillion yen per month, its casualties amount to 700,000, 649 aircraft have been shot down, and 2,202 have been damaged due to accidents. More than 580 warships have been injured. The anti-war atmosphere in its country is increasingly intense, and the war-weariness of the combat troops is growing. There is even talk of a century-long war domestically. All these expose their difficulties. The enemy is at the end of its rope, and we must strengthen our belief in certain victory and success. In spirit, we must: (1) Everyone must have the determination to sacrifice for the country and fight the enemy to the death; (2) Everyone must fulfill their responsibilities to the country; (3) We must cultivate the integrity that revolutionaries should possess. Kuomintang members must have the spirit of sacrificing themselves for righteousness, abandoning life for justice, and fearlessness, taking teaching the nation and saving the nation as a lifelong career. Every word and action should be based on the national policy of the country and the leadership of the leader, sacrificing the individual to seek a way out for the country and nation, and never taking individual interests as the premise. One day making one proposal, and the next day making another, treating national affairs as child's play, departing from the position of a revolutionary; (4) We must not be blinded by the enemy's deceptive tactics or swayed by their propaganda policies. Although the battles on various fronts seem calm on the surface, they are actually actively preparing. After the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, the means of aggression will become more intense, and the desire for a quick victory and quick resolution will become more urgent. With the deep sympathy and assistance of the international community, we should make persistent efforts, prepare for the greatest sacrifices, firmly establish our confidence in victory, calmly respond, and final victory will surely belong to us.

<h3 id="e31">The Tragic State of Robbery and Killing by the Japanese Army Invading Guangdong in Jiujiang: More Than a Thousand People Were Killed, and the Loss of Pawnshops Exceeded Ten Million <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Shiqi correspondence: Whenever the Japanese army invades Guangdong, upon reaching a town, they implement a policy of arson and looting. Guangzhou was burned and looted, and no essence was spared. Shops and residences, gold and silver treasures, calligraphy and paintings, were, of course, plundered. Even salt, tungsten ore, rice, and so on, were all swept away. Therefore, ten houses out of ten were empty, and even those that were not destroyed had nothing left inside. The towns of Foshan, San, Southwest, Hekou, Chencun, Daliang, and Jiujiang all suffered the same tragic looting. Among them, Southwest and Chencun had the most houses burned, while Jiujiang suffered the greatest loss from gunfire. Jiujiang is a major town under the jurisdiction of Nanhai County, almost as famous as Foshan, with prosperous people and abundant resources, and a high culture. It is a town praised by the Cantonese. When the Japanese army attacked the city on the morning of December 3, the local self-defense corps resisted at the southern area, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army, killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. However, due to their inability to match the Japanese army's firepower, they had no choice but to withdraw from the city. The Japanese army deeply resented the resistance of the self-defense corps and launched a large-scale massacre after entering the city as revenge. More than a thousand men were killed. Women who could not escape jumped into nearby fish ponds to commit suicide, showing their unwillingness to surrender. Therefore, hundreds more died, truly a tragic event in the world. The valuable items of all households in Jiujiang were looted. Among them, the biggest loss was to the pawnshops. According to investigation, there were more than thirty pawnshops in Jiujiang City. Each pawnshop was built in the center of a fish pond. In the past, in the event of military affairs, each pawnshop would revoke the bridge and feel safe. Therefore, the citizens of Jiujiang often stored valuable property in the pawnshops for a small price. Now that the Japanese army arrived in Jiujiang, the citizens of Jiujiang did not expect it to be so urgent, so they did not retrieve and evacuate their valuable items beforehand, resulting in the gold and silver objects stored in the pawnshops being looted by the Japanese army. Among them, the largest loss was the Gongyuan Pawnshop in Zhabian, with gold, silver, and jewelry reaching more than one million yuan. Eyewitnesses saw the Japanese using several vehicles to transport the above items away. The loss of other pawnshops ranged from 200,000 to 300,000 or even 500,000, with a total of around 15 million. The citizens of Jiujiang, suffering such an unprecedented looting, deeply hate it, and it will be difficult to forget even after hundreds of generations. The Japanese army currently occupying Jiujiang City consists of three or four hundred people, but they are often transferred to Shunde and various parts of the Xijiang River as tools of aggression. Those who have not been transferred often gather in the market area between the south of the city and Heqing during the day, arbitrarily harassing, and at night they retreat to the Zudansha Mountain (isolated island in the river) along the Xijiang River, with dozens of speedboats patrolling and guarding. Inside the city, Chinese traitors, acting on the instructions of the Japanese army, organized a puppet maintenance association, nominally to maintain law and order, but in reality to oppress the people and make them obedient citizens. It is rumored that a guerrilla unit led by Deng once entered the city, but this is not confirmed.</p>
<p>The day after the Japanese army invaded Jiujiang City, they continued to attempt to advance, attacking Gubu, which belonged to Heshan County, with several hundred people. At that time, the Chinese army's self-defense corps fought bravely and eventually repelled the Japanese army. Subsequently, the Japanese army transferred several hundred more people stationed in Jiujiang to reinforce, but they were still defeated by the self-defense corps, and two or three hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army initially thought that they could take advantage of their victory and advance sharply, so they carelessly advanced deeply. Later, the Japanese army successively increased their troops in Jiujiang, with cavalry and artillery, and used Jiujiang as a base to successively occupy Gulao, which belonged to Heshan County, and Ganzhu, which belonged to Shunde County, and claimed to invade Jiangmen, which belonged to Xinhui County. However, Jiangmen is still safe. It is heard that the Japanese army's cunning plan is to attempt to take the Gaoming County route along the Yaoming Highway, obliquely exiting Xinhu, Baishi, and Jinduli, in order to flank Zhaoqing. Therefore, the loss of Jiujiang is of great importance to the war on the Xijiang River.</p>

<p>(Rome) Italy is experiencing a severe shortage of coffee. The government recently limited each person to purchasing only 500 cubic centimeters, but in reality, it is impossible to purchase any. (Havas Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is experiencing a severe shortage of coffee. The government recently limited each person to purchasing only 125 cubic centimeters at a time. According to reports from the Berlin Stock Exchange, since 1933, the purchasing power of the German people has increased and the territory has continued to expand, resulting in a 50% increase in coffee consumption. The supply falling short of demand is to be expected. However, the main reason for the domestic shortage of coffee is the poor relationship between Germany and Brazil (which is also the main coffee-producing country). All citizens should economize on coffee consumption, and at the same time, the government must do its best to meet the needs of the people. If producing countries can sell coffee according to the "barter" method, then Germany should purchase more of it. (Havas Telegraph, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) Reuters learned today that responsible figures here believe that various rumors creating the impression that the British government intends to take immediate action to force Japan to respect the open door policy in China are inaccurate. They say that the British government has been studying ways to protect its interests in China for a long time, viewing freedom of navigation on the Yangtze River as crucial, but the entire issue is very complex. Although it can now be said that the attitudes of both the United Kingdom and the United States have a clear tendency to become tougher, careful consideration must be given to how to proceed in the most appropriate way before action is taken. (Reuters Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent claimed that when British cabinet members met today before Prime Minister Chamberlain's departure for Rome, the Far East issue would also be discussed. In recent days, the British government has been closely considering how to put pressure on Japan to maintain the open door policy in China in order to respect British interests, and has been studying various ways to exert pressure on Japan, including increasing import tariffs on Japanese goods and preferential treatment for China. The US government is also reviewing the situation and seeking ways to assist Chinese legal tender, which will definitely be detrimental to Japan. (Reuters Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party's Daily Mail recently published an editorial commenting on the Far East situation, stating: "The relationship between Western countries and the Far East is not very good. In fact, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States are now discussing what kind of pressure should be exerted on Japan to prevent it from abolishing the principle of the open door in China. At this point, the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees equal opportunities in trade for all related countries, has been virtually declared abolished by Japan. After the cabinet with strong nationalist colors succeeded the Konoe cabinet in governing, it may take more aggressive actions. Any large business country cannot tolerate this kind of treatment, especially since the United Kingdom has invested a total of £244,000,000 in China, and has sufficient reason to take various measures within its power to protect its huge investment. But what means should be used to achieve this goal? When the British Cabinet meets today, it is said that it will consider a measure to increase import tariffs on Japanese goods. In addition to this, there will be other suggestions that will also be submitted for discussion. After the implementation of this measure, Japan's trade in countries around the world will suffer significant losses. Even if the country can forcibly implement an economic closed-door policy in the Far East as a countermeasure, it will definitely be counterproductive." (Havas Telegraph, 9th)</p>

<p>(New York) The New York Times recently published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent stating that the government will soon submit the 1939-40 naval construction program to Congress, which includes two battleships that, when completed, will become the largest and fastest warships in the United States. According to information received from the Navy Department, Japan plans to build battleships of 40,000 to 46,000 tons, so the US Navy authorities have decided to build two 45,000-ton battleships to cope with this. These battleships will be equipped with nine 16-inch guns, with a speed of 30 to 36 knots per hour. Their armor will be thicker than that of the 35,000-ton battleships currently under construction, in order to enhance their resistance. However, their size will not be too large, so that they can pass through the Panama Canal. The cost of each ship is between 90 million and 110 million US dollars. (Havas Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is expected that President Roosevelt's defense message to Congress this week will advocate strengthening the US defense, paying attention to air defense. According to reliable predictions, this message will state that the German Air Force is now much stronger than any other country in the world, so the United States cannot lag behind. He will advocate the following points: (1) Quadrupling the number of naval and army aircraft ordered in the next fiscal year; (2) Training 20,000 pilots and more than 20,000 mechanics each year; (3) Increasing the number of army pilots from 20,000 to 60,000; (4) Infantry and artillery must also be expanded; (5) Allocating more than 100 million yuan to arm protective forces; (6) There must be more training orders in the field of arms manufacturing; (7) The Army and Navy must have eight new air force bases. According to political circles, in addition to the above seven points, President Roosevelt will advocate placing orders for at least 5,000 aircraft in the first year, and continue to increase in the second year, so that the Army has 2,000 aircraft and the Navy has more than 3,000 aircraft.

<p>(New York) The Foreign Affairs Association Monthly recently published an article stating that since the Munich Agreement was established, the possibility of conflict between Germany and the United States has greatly increased. Since then, Germany has no longer attacked the Soviet Union, France, or Czechoslovakia, but has attacked the United Kingdom and the United States. "The country's attitude is aimed at controlling the world, and it can conflict with the United States in South America and with the United Kingdom in Africa. This conflict will not be an armed conflict, but Germany can use various methods of threats, propaganda, and economic expansion to dispute with the United Kingdom and the United States. The country has used this method to annex Austria and the Sudetenland without bloodshed. Why not apply it to South America?" The conclusion is: "The United States is now preparing to strengthen the defenses of Latin American countries to prevent the invasion of National Socialism." (Havas Telegraph, 9th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Foreign news: Since Hiranuma formed a cabinet, most of the opinions of various countries believe that its policy towards China will become more aggressive. Although Soviet newspapers only published the list of cabinet members in the Hiranuma cabinet, they also excerpted a comment from the Parisian People's Newspaper, believing that Hiranuma's cabinet will become more closely aligned with Germany and Italy. Its foreign policy will not only be unfavorable to China, but will also greatly affect the Soviet Union and the United States. British public opinion, due to the US president's speech and various European issues, does not attach much importance to the Japanese cabinet reshuffle, and publishes such news in a decided position. However, public opinion unanimously believes that the new cabinet has Fascist tendencies, the power of the military is stronger, and its internal and external policies, with military aggression against China, will become more tense, and will also express its urgent situation. French newspapers also have similar comments, believing that Konoe's resignation was forced by the military, and Hiranuma came from the right wing, so the trend should be more active. However, the newspapers have recently paid great attention to the fact that the last cabinet member did not participate in the new cabinet, because they said that the new cabinet's policy may still be based on the recent decision of the Imperial Council to find ways to negotiate peace with China, and said that the Hiranuma cabinet obviously has a transitional nature and is the last attempt of the moderates. If it fails again, it may not be possible to avoid dictatorship. In short, Japan has now reached the most difficult stage, and all factions feel that there is no way to deal with the war, and there is no way to step down domestically. Its financial figures do not want to serve as finance ministers, which shows that the finances are difficult. It is also worthy of attention. Public opinion commonly believes that Hiranuma's cabinet has increased the power of the military, but the United States has a tough attitude, domestic contradictions have increased, and the old financial official, Mr. Ike, has left office and been replaced by a newcomer. I am afraid that the new cabinet will not dare to be too aggressive. The Italian side has not yet expressed its views on this, while German newspapers mostly imply that Konoe's downfall was due to his inability to satisfy the desires of the military. The Hiranuma cabinet will definitely do its best to end the military against China. The Tokyo correspondent of the French Daily reported that Konoe's attempt to seek peace was unsuccessful, and there was no way to improve relations with the United Kingdom and the United States. He was forced to resign. The new cabinet's responsibility is to deal with war-weary elements and eliminate the panic of international deterioration. It will inevitably implement economic mobilization in an attempt to achieve final victory, etc. It can be seen that Japan has reached the end of its strength and is still trying to make a final attempt at aggression against China.

<p>(Moscow) According to the Associated Press correspondent quoting Japanese sources, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigenori Tōgō and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov continued their talks for two hours this afternoon. However, there was still no progress on the fisheries dispute. It is reported that these negotiations have reached their eleventh session. Newspapers today expressed opinions on the Soviet government's attitude. The Red Army's organ, Red Star, stated, "The Japanese government permitting the Soviet Union to fish in Japanese territorial waters is not the same as the Soviet government permitting Japan to fish in Soviet territorial waters. Hence, the result of this kind of irreconcilable difference." The newspaper concluded by comparing the current deadlock in fisheries negotiations with the Zhanggufeng Incident, saying, "The Japanese people, based on their own past experience, should deeply understand the fundamental difference between the armies of the Tsarist era and the Red Army. In the Zhanggufeng area, the Red Army gave the Japanese people an excellent lesson. They should know that the Soviet people will not allow anyone to infringe upon their rights anywhere."

<p>(London) Today is the eve of Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax's visit to Rome. However, The Times and the Daily Telegraph are unable to clearly reveal the true intentions of the two ministers. According to The Times' diplomatic correspondent, the Rome talks seem to have no fixed agenda. Both sides want to understand the other's views and positions on various issues before proposing a formal understanding formula. However, rumors that Britain intends to alienate the German-Italian axis or break France's resistance to Italy's demands during the Rome talks are absolutely unfounded. Regarding Anglo-Italian business relations, the Rome talks have no special provisions for this kind of trend. However, economic matters will be involved in the meeting. The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent said that the rumors that Prime Minister Chamberlain went to Rome to discuss the withdrawal of Italian volunteers in Spain are not true. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's upcoming visit to Italy, Italian newspapers have published comments, saying, "In any case, Italy's demands will be satisfied." German newspapers have reprinted these comments, saying that after the British cabinet members arrive in Rome, they must use the spirit of the Munich Agreement as a basis to facilitate the resolution of the entire Mediterranean issue. The "Monday" newspaper used a large headline to report, "The Italian government believes that French Prime Minister Daladier's inspection of Corsica and Tunisia is useless." It also said, "After the Munich Agreement was reached, the 'practical benefit' policy has been remarkably effective. The crisis in the Mediterranean, that is, the crisis in Europe, can be resolved with a 'no concessions' policy. The crux of the matter is here on the eve of Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Rome. As for the Spanish issue, from a European standpoint, it is the balance of power in the Mediterranean. Since both British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are concerned with maintaining the balance of power among countries, the Spanish issue has naturally become the main issue of future talks between Britain and Italy. In short, if Spain becomes a 'branch' of Moscow, the status quo in the Mediterranean guaranteed by the Anglo-Italian Agreement will be destroyed. The British government must be aware of this." (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) On the eve of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's visit to Rome, political figures here superficially believe that Prime Minister Chamberlain will act as a mediator between Italy and France. However, they also know that this hope is difficult to realize in practice. Moreover, they are quite unhappy that British cabinet members will make a brief stop in Paris to meet with French cabinet members, in order to show that Britain and France maintain allied relations. In addition, the Spanish Nationalist Army's current attack on Catalonia, which is being participated in by Italian soldiers, has left a bad impression on London. The local Tribune commented on this matter, saying, "After U.S. President Roosevelt's address to Congress, British imperialists have been encouraged and are criticizing our country's volunteer soldiers' brave actions."

<p>Hungarian Capital: The fascist party's National Front, namely the Gray Shirt Party's organ "Világ," recently reported that two representatives recently sent by the autonomous government of Carpathian Ruthenia in Czechoslovakia came to the Hungarian capital for negotiations, advocating the exchange of 25 villages belonging to the province for the cities of Munkács and Ungvár (i.e., Uzhhorod), which were previously ceded to Hungary in accordance with the Vienna Arbitration Award. This was rejected by the Hungarian government. The Czech troops' attack on Munkács was probably caused by this. It is said that the Munkács incident was instigated by Ukrainians in that country. These autonomists are supported by "a certain great power" (referring to Germany), and they do not hesitate to act recklessly. In fact, although Czechs and Ukrainians say that this great power is behind them, even with cannons, tanks, machine guns, and five times the manpower, they still failed to cross the line. The anti-Hungarian struggle that has been going on in diplomacy since the Vienna Conference has also failed. Observers here recently commented on this article, saying that it is the first time that Hungarian newspapers have openly accused "a certain great power" of supporting Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia.

<h3 id="e43">Turkey Cracks Down on Private Arms Trafficking Organization, Supplying Spanish Nationalist Army, Former Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrested <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey: Police in this city cracked down on a private arms trafficking organization today that specializes in purchasing airplanes for the Spanish Nationalist Army. It planned to purchase 50 airplanes from the United States and Canada and transport part of them to Spain. The Turkish Embassy in the United States learned of this and immediately telegraphed the government, leading to the cracking of the case. The main culprit, Rub, the former director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been arrested. An accomplice, Hamondy, was arrested in the Vormania border area, but was released after powerful people interceded for him. He escaped to France, but was arrested again because the authorities of a certain country filed a complaint. In addition, several Turkish congressmen and many people from the local community and business circles are reported to be involved. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e44">Spanish Nationalist Army Breaks Through Main Force of Government Army, Preparing to Attack Catalan Mountain Fortress, Dozens Killed and Wounded in Bombing of Valencia <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Burgos: The Nationalist Army has now crossed the two main roads leading to Barcelona and is making rapid progress. The central army, based in Lleida and Balaguer, has occupied Mollerussa, an important town 14 miles east of Lleida and on the northern road to the Catalan capital. The government army is retreating rapidly to Sefra, about 20 miles further east, and is blowing up bridges. However, Nationalist Army engineering teams are rapidly repairing roads and railways in order to attack Sefra and the mountains of Mount Blanch, two strongholds in the Catalan mountains. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Zaragoza: The Spanish Nationalist Army has now occupied the new village of Pola de San, which is 19 miles from the Mediterranean and 24 miles from Tarragona. According to authorities here, the Nationalist Army's general offensive against Catalonia has now entered its third week and has broken the main resistance of the government army on the Ogier Plain. However, there are still difficulties ahead, which the northern front is particularly concerned about. It can now be noted that General Yagüe's Moroccan army built a pontoon bridge in the Mora area, crossed the Ebro River, and established contact with the local army in Navarra Province. It is now waiting for an opportunity to attack Faucet, 25 miles west of Tarragona. This action, which has long been expected, will threaten both the southeast flanks of Tarragona. The Nationalist Army headquarters now claims that since the start of the general offensive, the Nationalist Army has gained at least 1,200 square miles and captured 30,000 enemies. The army attacking Catalonia has 300,000 men, most of whom have now crossed the Ebro River, which is the main natural defense line of the government army. The Aragon Legion crossed the river upstream from Lleida by building a bridge yesterday morning and joined forces with the army that set out from the Balaguer bridgehead, dispersing in the countryside dotted with farms. Two of the government army's last strongholds were occupied last night after heavy shelling. The Aragon Army has now advanced to 12.5 miles east of Balaguer. The Nationalist Army is now advancing westward to eliminate the positions between Altesa and Potjes Blanes. The government army is retreating under artillery fire along the highway between Lleida and Tarragona. Although there is a lot of fog on the northern front, the climate elsewhere is quite suitable.

<p>Swedish Capital: Åland Islands, located in the Baltic Sea, are between Finland and Sweden, at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, in a strategic location. Until 1917, they belonged to Russia. By 1921, Finland and Sweden had a dispute over the sovereignty of the islands. Later, the Council of the League of Nations ruled that they belonged to Finland. Russia's declaration in 1856 promising not to establish defenses on the island was also accepted by Finland and confirmed by a treaty between Sweden and Finland. Today, Sweden and Finland, due to changes in the international situation, are negotiating again on the issue of fortifications. According to official statements, a plan has now been agreed upon and will be submitted to the governments of both countries for approval. The main points are as follows: (1) Finland may take military measures in the southern part of the Åland Islands; (2) Although some military measures may be taken in other parts of the islands, the scope will be determined by separate agreements between the two parties; (3) Finland may implement conscription on the islands, but Swedish officers and adjutants must be stationed on the islands and issue orders in Swedish.

<p>Beirut: The treaty signed between France and Syria on September 9, 1936, stipulated that Syria would become an independent country after three years. After the French Parliament refused to ratify it, residents of major cities in Syria held demonstrations, but their scale was not as large as expected. For example, only 400 residents participated in the demonstration in Homs. Most stores that closed in the morning reopened as usual in the afternoon. About 3,000 residents of Aleppo marched in formation, and several thousand citizens of Damascus held a rally. The hosts delivered speeches, including Minister of the Interior Jabri. It is said that Syrian nationalists are willing to form an alliance treaty with France, but since Syrians are an entire nation, they naturally enjoy the right to self-determination. The demonstrators then marched to the Prime Minister's residence to petition. Prime Minister Mardam delivered a speech to them, urging the Syrian people to unite to ensure independence. The demonstrators dispersed at noon, and the whole city returned to calm. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e49">American Reporter Hanson Talks About China's Greatest Strength: Chiang, Bai, and Zhou Work Together and Are Determined Not to Compromise with Japan <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that American journalist Hanson, who has traveled extensively throughout China for three years, recently returned to the United States. While passing through Tokyo, he expressed his views to an American business newspaper, stating that China's greatest strength lies in the harmonious cooperation of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, General Bai Chongxi, and General Zhou Enlai, who were once at odds. Hanson came to China three years ago as a reporter for the Boston Post and has since worked for several American newspapers and news agencies in the Far East. He spent a year in China, often staying in Peiping, Shanghai, Hankou, and Fujian. While in Fujian Province, he studied the situation regarding poisons. In the last half-year of his stay in China, Hanson traveled to a particularly wide range of areas. Last summer, he traveled to guerrilla areas in northern China, including Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Suiyuan. According to the American business newspaper in Tokyo, Hanson said that Bai Chongxi and Zhou Enlai were at odds with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek before the war, but now they are his right-hand men. These three, along with those loyal to them, control China's military, economy, and personnel. The only person capable of undermining them is Wang Jingwei, but he has no military or financial power and now seems to have been driven out, with no one supporting him. Any peace negotiations must be based on these three, and as long as they are in power, there will be no chance of compromise with Japan. General Bai Chongxi, from Guangxi Province, with a population of eighteen million, has devoted all of its economic wealth and most of its manpower to the war of resistance. His only chance in the future is to obtain a position in the government, so Bai will definitely cooperate with Generalissimo Chiang to the end. When Chiang was the head of the Whampoa Military Academy, Zhou Enlai was the head of the political department, so he has a close personal relationship with Chiang. Zhou was the one who advocated for Chiang's release during the Xi'an Incident and is now one of the dozen or so leading figures in the Communist Party. If he were to compromise with Japan, the Communist Party would see him as a traitor. Seven or eight out of ten of China's new troops are loyal to Generalissimo Chiang. At the beginning of the war, about half of the troops were under the command of warlords, but most of them have now died on the battlefield, so there were more deaths in the early stages of the war. Later, the troops trained by officers directly under Chiang Kai-shek were used to replenish the ranks. Very few troops under the warlords remain, and even these few have been assimilated by the replacement troops loyal to Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, Chiang Kai-shek promoted all the warlords to very high positions, so that they no longer have direct control over the troops, and almost all of the warlords have been appointed as commanders of army groups, directly under the command of the Supreme Military Council. At the same time, the warlords have also become unswervingly loyal, and are no longer as easily bought as they were in the past, such as Shi Yousan, Director of Pacification for northern Hebei, Zhang Zizhong, Mayor of Tianjin, Feng Zhian, Chairman of Hebei Province, and Liu Ruming, Chairman of Chahar Province, who were the main figures in the peace negotiations at the Lugouqiao incident. They are now all in the ranks of army group commanders. The strategy and manpower of the troops directly under Chiang Kai-shek are now stronger than at the beginning of the war, their officers are more experienced, and their equipment is more complete and suitable. Take heavy artillery as an example, it is much better than before. In addition, the gasoline stored in the Northwest can be used for six months, and at the same time, a large amount of gasoline is being transported into China, and a large amount of military supplies are stored, enough for a year of combat. Chiang Kai-shek still employs a former senior German officer as an advisor. Bai Chongxi is one of the most outstanding military leaders in China today, and his wisdom amazes even the German advisor, who once said that the only person whose military strategy he cannot fathom is Bai. Bai is also recognized as the supreme leader of China's twenty million Muslims, and his trusted troops number four hundred thousand. Zhou Enlai is the representative of the Communist Party and does not hold a position in the government, and since the Communist Party has dedicated itself to the war of resistance, it has not increased its political power or status in the government. Only seven of the two hundred councilors are members of the Communist Party. Zhou once served as the commander of the Eighth Route Army, but he is mostly a political leader who was educated in France and the Soviet Union. Among the things that have most surprised foreign observers about the Chinese government during the war of resistance is the establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation. Almost all of the organizers are former college professors or technical experts, and many were at odds with Chiang Kai-shek before the war. Among these figures, the most outstanding is the famous geologist Weng Wenhao. Weng is definitely not someone who blindly follows others. Appointing people according to their talents may have started with the Ministry of Economic Affairs in modern Chinese history. Almost all of those working in the ministry are students who have studied in Europe and the United States, and almost all are university professors. The supply of troops and the development of industry and raw materials all depend on these two ministries.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Dream of Issuing Counterfeit Money by the Japanese Army in North China Turns into a Pipe Dream; Counterfeit Money Cannot Usurp the Legal Tender's Position; Japanese Businesses and the Financial World Suffer <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The North China correspondence of the 字林报, December 29th, Tianjin: The counterfeit money of the "United Reserve Bank" has not been successful in North China to date. The so-called "united" refers to the united banks of North China. The Japanese issuance of counterfeit "United Reserve" money emulates the precedent of the puppet "Manchukuo," without considering the situation of North China itself for many years. The currency change in North China differs from the puppet "Manchukuo" in one important point: in the puppet "Manchukuo," the Japanese replaced worthless Fengpiao notes, but in North China, there was valuable currency in existence, namely the legal tender of the Chinese National Government. Hence, the difficulty in counterfeit money usurping legal tender is one of the main reasons. The establishment of the "United Reserve Bank" originally had two intentions: first, it was purely a political measure to clearly demonstrate the change of regime and to incorporate the economy of North China into the so-called yen bloc. However, more importantly, the Japanese military authorities hoped to obtain legal tender through this means, which they would transport to Shanghai and use to purchase much-needed foreign exchange. However, this plan failed because the Chinese government issued special regulations to control foreign exchange. Moreover, there was a need to recall the large number of yen notes in circulation in North China, which are said to amount to 60 million yen. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to collect legal tender was initially thwarted. Furthermore, there are three reasons why the counterfeit "United Reserve" money has not become the sole currency of North China: (1) Most of the guerrilla areas in North China are in the hands of the Chinese, where the use of counterfeit money is prohibited. Those who carry counterfeit money are immediately executed. Therefore, those who purchase goods in that area all use legal tender. (2) The "United Reserve Bank" itself cannot use its counterfeit money to purchase foreign exchange. The Japanese originally intended to obtain 60 million yuan in silver that remained in North China as a reserve for purchasing foreign exchange, but this silver is stored in the banks of the Tianjin concessions and has not been obtained to date. (3) Foreign banks refuse to accept counterfeit "United Reserve" money and refuse to sell foreign exchange in exchange for counterfeit money. It is said that the Japanese military authorities, who single-handedly established the "United Reserve Bank," disregarded the advice and warnings of the Japanese financial world and, using special methods, attempted to expel legal tender by threatening strict punishment for those who did not comply, ordering that legal tender be devalued to 90 cents for one yuan of counterfeit money, and issuing another order stating that after March of this year, legal tender would be illegal currency and those who risked using it would be severely punished. However, to date, these measures have all failed to achieve their goals. Not only that, but the issuance of counterfeit money has seriously affected Japanese trade. Initially, legal tender was worth one shilling and two pence, and Japanese banks also treated counterfeit money as part of the yen bloc and exchanged it at face value. Later, when legal tender fell to around eight pence, Japanese banks suffered heavy losses and had to stop accepting counterfeit money, resulting in a sharp decline in Japanese import commerce. This clearly shows that counterfeit money cannot be called a stable currency; at best, it is just a gambling chip. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Japanese business and financial worlds are suffering greatly from the current financial chaos in North China, and they definitely do not welcome the devaluation of legal tender, as they are also hit hard. It is said that they are also making every effort to oppose the extension of counterfeit money to other parts of China. Although it is rumored that the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai and southern China do not allow counterfeit money to circulate in those two areas purely out of jealousy, the main purpose of establishing the "United Reserve Bank," namely to obtain a large amount of foreign currency, has not been achieved to date. It is also heard that the Japanese military authorities in North China are now planning to completely control export and import trade, only issuing export licenses to merchants who pay foreign currency to the Yokohama Specie Bank or the "United Reserve Bank," while strictly controlling imports. If this were to happen, the Japanese military authorities could obtain a large amount of foreign exchange deposits. However, many export locations in North China are still under Chinese control, and Mongolia continues to strictly enforce its exchange controls. Therefore, it is doubtful whether these plans can achieve their goals, and it is feared that the trade in North China will come to a complete standstill, causing counterfeit money to decline in value.</p>
<h3 id="e51">A Prisoner Who Participated in the New Fourth Army's Work <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Su, from southern Anhui</p>
<p>Because I heard Commander Xiang Ying talk last night about the New Fourth Army's methods of dealing with Japanese prisoners, which are very interesting, I requested to speak face-to-face with a Japanese prisoner.</p>
<p>According to Commander Xiang, the New Fourth Army not only does not kill prisoners, and not only treats prisoners favorably, but also actively gives Japanese prisoners freedom to go out, communicate, read, and work. Therefore, Japanese prisoners in the New Fourth Army are like being at home, wearing the same uniforms as the New Fourth Army, and wearing military caps with the blue sky and white sun emblem. When they have nothing to do, they can freely stroll down the street, and the common people and brothers do not find it strange. The New Fourth Army's special organ in charge of educating and managing prisoners is the "Enemy Work Department." According to Commander Xiang, in the half-year since the New Fourth Army started fighting, it has captured more than 590 Japanese and puppet soldiers, and some of them have already been able to participate in the New Fourth Army's political work.</p>
<p>Today (December 2nd) morning, in a peasant's home, I met two young Japanese prisoners through the introduction of Lin Zhifu, the Minister of the Enemy Work Department of the New Fourth Army, and Deng Zihui, the Deputy Director of the Political Department. When I entered the house, they were both bent over the table reading books. They were both wearing gray cotton overcoats and Chinese military caps. As soon as they heard someone, they immediately ran over with smiles, showing a welcoming attitude. If it hadn't been for Minister Lin's explanation, I would have thought that these two were New Fourth Army staff in charge of managing prisoners.</p>
<p>I talked with the prisoners for more than an hour, from their backgrounds, families, and love affairs to the future of the Sino-Japanese War. Now, in order to reflect their true opinions, I will write down the entire Q&amp;A record below. Reporter (Q): What is your name? Japanese prisoner (A): My name is Kono Masao, and he (pointing to another Japanese prisoner) is named Tahata Sakuzo. (The following is a conversation between the reporter and Kono Masao) (Q): When did you come to this place? (A): About the end of July or the beginning of August this year. (Q): How old are you this year? (A): I am twenty-two years old this year. (Q): What position did you hold in the army? (A): I was a member of the transport corps in the Third Division of the Army. (Q): Where is your home? (A): In Tokyo, Japan. (Q): Who else is in your family? (A): My father, mother, and two younger brothers. (Q): What was your occupation in Japan? (A): I had no occupation. I was studying at a senior commercial school in Tokyo. (Q): Where did you land in China? (A): We landed at Wusong, but Japanese soldiers do not necessarily land at Wusong. Some land in Nanjing. (Q): When were you drafted into the army, and when did you leave the country to come to China? (A): I was drafted into the army in February of this year and transferred to China in June. (Q): What did the Japanese military tell you to do in China? (A): They told us to fight against China's red bandits and Chiang Kai-shek. At first, we did not know that the Japanese army was invading and committing many atrocities in China. (Q): When you were drafted into the army to come to China, what did you and your family feel? (A): At that time, I was very distressed spiritually. Limited by national laws, I could not resist. My family, of course, felt the same way and did not want me to go out. (Q): Where did you live for two months in Shanghai? (A): In a textile factory in the east of Yangshupu. (Q): What places did you visit in Shanghai? (A): I visited Zhabei and Nanshi, but the scenes were very bleak. I have not been to the bustling center of the concessions. (Q): Have you ever seen Japanese soldiers raping and killing Chinese people? (A): I have not seen the rape of women myself, but I have heard the brothers in the army often talk about it. I think some of them must have done it. I have not only seen the massacre of Chinese people, but I have also seen many thousands of Chinese people being killed alive. At that time, I felt very sad, but only sad. (Q): Before you were captured in Zhu, you had already been in China for two or three months. Just based on these three months in China, what are your thoughts, especially about the Sino-Japanese War? (A): Because the time was very short, I did not see many things. However, one thing is that when I arrived in Nanjing, I saw many Chinese people being killed. At that time, the superiors told our soldiers that they were all "bandits"—Chinese guerrillas—so they should be killed. At that time, I thought, why are there so many "bandits" and so many guerrillas in China? My brothers and I felt the same way, so we gradually began to doubt the news of the war in Central China that was being promoted in Japan—but it was only internal doubt and depression. It was very difficult to take any action or resistance.</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Financial Market of Shanghai <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>Since Shanghai fell, the population between the concessions has increased sharply. However, the people's livelihood and economy cannot increase the vitality of Shanghai's commercial market, so financial activities should continue to stagnate. However, the reality is not the case: the Japanese side is advocating the "United Bank" in North China, recklessly plundering legal tender, and selling foreign exchange in Shanghai. Our side then resolutely implemented foreign exchange controls. All parties did not understand the truth and misunderstood our intentions. Even foreign banks abolished the "gentlemen's agreement" and temporarily suspended cooperation with our currency and financial system. Although our central bank always supplied foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate, initially supplying 400,000 to 500,000 pounds per week, which far exceeded the regular needs of Shanghai's foreign trade, it was still not understood. They used their privileges in China to maintain their "free market" for buying and selling foreign exchange outside our central bank, creating shocking black market prices every day. Although the motive may not have been to help the wicked and disrupt legal tender, the fact was that it was being used by the enemy to attack legal tender. In addition, ignorant Chinese people, fearing the devaluation of legal tender, rushed to flee their funds; or they tried to order goods from abroad as much as possible to avoid reducing foreign exchange losses. Also, because we restricted the import of various luxury goods and non-essential goods, those who sought profit even increased their imports to make profits. As a result, the demand for foreign exchange in the black market was extremely urgent, and the exchange rate plummeted. Starting with this kind of foreign exchange speculation, the cash, securities, and other markets also set up dark markets outside the exchange, wriggling and moving. The stagnant Shanghai financial market was thus revived in an atmosphere of speculation.</p>
<p>(IV) The Revival of the Bill Market</p>
<p>This kind of unreasonable transformation can be seen in the rise and fall of the bill turnover of the silver and money industry. (Unit: millions of national currency)</p>
<p>Exchange and settlement of bills by the Shanghai silver and money industry</p>
<p>The use of bank bills originally developed after the establishment of the acceptance center. Last July, the exchange volume reached a record high of over 900 million yuan. However, with the outbreak of the war, it plummeted. By February of this year, it had fallen to only 85 million. But then it gradually recovered; now it is almost on par with the exchange volume of the previous year. Recently, the China, Communications, and Bank of China have been cooperating with foreign banks in exchanging clearinghouse bills, allowing them to be used in the same way as those of the Bund clearinghouse, without discrimination. This not only makes Shanghai's currency market more active than before, but also gives hope for further increases in exchange volume in the future.</p>
<p>The number of money shop public slips redeemed each month this year also seems to have decreased sharply compared with the early months after the war. This is due to the contraction of credit and cautious lending by the shops, which has led to this. But the main reason is that the debts left over from before the war have been transferred to the book, so it cannot be used as a measure of their rise and fall.</p>
<p>(V) The Transition of the Interest Rate Market</p>
<p>Since the currency system reform and centralized issuance, there has been a regulatory mechanism to balance the supply and demand of currency in the market, so the high-interest-rate state of previous years has gradually returned to normal. In 1936, the silver and money industry and even the financial authorities unanimously advocated the implementation of a low-interest-rate policy to promote national economic construction. Therefore, the interest rate in Shanghai was no higher than one cent. In the first half of 1937, there was a period of tension due to the tea market and speculative frenzy, but it was only 1.67 cents, and it soon fell back.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the situation changed dramatically. Credit in the shops shrank greatly, and it was very difficult to borrow money. It immediately jumped to two cents. There were still few suppliers. It has now softened, so suppliers are even harder to find. This can be seen in the decline in the number of money shop public slips redeemed.</p>
<p>From the rise and fall of bank bill exchange volumes in the past and present, it can be seen that the interest rate market currently opened by the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry can better indicate the profits and losses of the Shanghai financial market today. Since the implementation of the financial stabilization measures, in addition to public slip call rates, acceptance discount rates, and exchange rates, the committee has added a clearinghouse call rate. Although this type of clearinghouse bill has illegal discounting today, and once reached 70 to 80 yuan per thousand, it is still not easy to obtain this kind of credit, so this call rate is now as high as 2.5 cents. Clearinghouse credit is even more difficult to obtain. Last winter, the call rate reached three cents.</p>
<p>In addition, after the establishment of the Discount and Loan Committee by the China, Communications, Agricultural, and Central Banks to handle interbank discounting and lending, Shanghai has another interest rate market, which is the discount rate and lending rate announced by the committee. The former is based on weekly interest, while the latter is based on monthly interest. The committee is responsible for regulating finance during the war, so its discount and loan policy is more policy-oriented than market-oriented. Everyone knows that the authorities have a desire to contract the currency in the Shanghai financial market. Therefore, the committee's steps have always followed the wishes of the authorities. This goes without saying. However, it is a pity that the situation in Shanghai is special, so the committee's activities have not yet had any impact.</p>
<p>(VI) Gold Market Speculation and Overseas Gold Prices</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the key to reviving the Shanghai financial market lies in the illegal speculation of foreign exchange. Before the currency system reform, our country's foreign exchange market was always affected by the fluctuation of gold and silver prices. Since the legal tender broke away from silver and became a managed currency, the China, Communications, and Central Banks have used artificial means to stabilize it at the legal rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. It completely lost its connection with the changes in world gold and silver prices. However, since our country implemented foreign exchange controls in early March of 1938, and illegal black markets have emerged, speculators have abused the fluctuations in gold and silver prices as a basis for stirring up trouble. They meant that most of China's foreign exchange reserves were still in silver and had not been converted into gold or foreign exchange. Therefore, the changes in the gold and silver ratio could affect the foreign exchange foundation of the legal tender. A drop in the price of silver would weaken the foreign exchange foundation; conversely, it would strengthen it. In addition, since the beginning of this year, the British pound has fluctuated due to the continuous tension in the European situation, and the Sino-American silver agreement is also expiring. Therefore, the price of gold in London rose sharply after May of this year. At that time, Shanghai already had an illegal foreign exchange market, so the impact was even worse. The spot price of gold in Shanghai rose to 2,000 yuan in mid-June, then softened briefly, and then rose again. In November, it reached a new high of 2,068 yuan.</p>
<p>Changes in Gold Prices in Shanghai and London (The index is based on 100 points in July 1937) Unit: Shanghai national currency yuan, London pence. Before August of last year, the Shanghai price was the spot gold price. In September, it was the standard price. From October to April 1938, it was the bank purchase price. After that, it was the black market closing price.</p>
<p>The Shanghai spot gold market was originally a gathering place for speculators. After the number of transactions reached 30 to 40 million over the years, it became deserted. For example, in April and May of 1935, the number of transactions often reached 2.7 to 2.8 million bars. In November of the same year, it dropped sharply to 390,000 bars. In November 1936, there were only 28,700 transactions. By 1937, it was very low. In January and February, only about 10,000 transactions had been completed. Later, there were only 7,000 to 8,000 transactions. By July, there were only 3,647 transactions. It stopped completely after the outbreak of the Shanghai war. Since the emergence of illegal transactions, the huge difference between the high and low prices, which is even greater than the rate of rise and fall in London, shows the intensity of the competition among the parties.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Sino-American loan and the Sino-British loan one after another, and the negotiations on the extension of the silver agreement have been successful, in addition to the increasingly favorable international situation for China, and the war situation in the War of Resistance has also undergone a progressive change, the people's morale has been greatly boosted, and the entire city has shown a slight recovery. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has also promulgated a policy requiring domestic gold production to be sold to the Central Bank and its agencies, and has initially implemented a national gold policy to replenish foreign exchange reserves. Although this cannot have much effect on the Shanghai gold market in the occupied area, it also has a certain effect on the speculative psychology in the gold market.</p>

<p>The situation at the border between Pudong and Shangchuan had barely eased when tensions rose again at the Shangnan border. An unspecified number of Chinese guerrillas had already moved into Beicai, about three to four li from Pudong Avenue. The area around Yanjiabridge, Liulibridge, and Yujiabridge was threatening the Japanese defense zone in Nanmatou and Shangnan Road. Encounters had been occurring daily, and the Japanese seemed to be suffering serious blows, with twenty to thirty killed or wounded in five days.</p>
<p>Dense Gunfire</p>
<p>would sporadically erupt at night. The Japanese troops would remain holed up in their defensive works, not daring to venture out. At 2:00 PM on the eighth, Chinese and Japanese forces clashed again west of Yanjiabridge. More than ten Japanese soldiers were ambushed, and two were wounded and retreated. Afterwards, the Nanmatou brigade came to reinforce them, cutting off land and water transportation. The Japanese merchant inland tugboats sailing into Bailianjing Port were also turned back by the Japanese army. The situation was</p>
<p>Unusually Tense.</p>
<p>However, the guerrillas adopted a strategy of avoiding strength and attacking weakness, purely using harassment tactics. By the time the Japanese reinforcements arrived, they had drifted away again, leaving the Japanese soldiers to toil in vain, exhausted from running around. Rumors were flying in Zhoujiadu, the starting point of Shangnan Road, and Zhoupu, its endpoint, causing great panic among the Japanese troops, who increased their alert. Every evening, Zhoupu Town would</p>
<p>Use Searchlights</p>
<p>from the high observation tower, shining them into the surrounding fields to guard against guerrilla attacks. The Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company's Beijing Maru and other ferries, which connect Nanjing Road's North Bund to the Shangnan train at Zhoujiadu, have canceled the Zhoujiadu route. It is still operated by the Japanese Nanhui Garrison's military ferry, the Nanhui Maru. Passengers without a "citizen's certificate" are at risk of arrest and loss of life. It is also understood that in the</p>
<p>Pudong Shangnan Border Area</p>
<p>around Bailianjing, Liulibridge, Nanmatou, and Yanjiabridge, the Japanese army has recently occupied civilian land, excavated farmland, and piled up six or seven grave mounds, claiming that they contain the bodies of soldiers who died in battle in the Shangnan area. However, according to internal sources, these are empty graves. All the corpses have been secretly cremated, and the ashes taken away. It is unknown what these empty graves are for. As for the</p>
<p>Guerrilla Forces</p>
<p>operating in the Chuansha and Fengxian areas of Pudong, after being ordered to be reorganized in Dinghai, Eastern Zhejiang, the authorities recently dispatched ×× units from Western Zhejiang to the Chuansha, Nanhui, and Fengxian areas to continue their activities. As a result, the situation in various places has become tense again, and the Japanese have also stepped up their alert. Along the Shangchuan and Shangnan lines, the Japanese have begun to increase their troop deployments. However, traffic to and from the east and west of the Huangpu River remains normal.</p>
<h3 id="e54">After Gold Control: Stabilizing Market Gold Prices; Preventing Gold Outflow and Curbing Speculation to Directly Increase China's Foreign Exchange Reserves <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent the outflow of gold and curb speculation, the Chinese government is implementing gold control. In addition to issuing measures for the exchange of gold items for legal tender, it is also supervising measures for silver shops to collect and exchange gold items, aiming to stabilize market gold prices and increase foreign exchange reserves. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Stabilizing Gold Prices</p>
<p>After the war, silver shops and gold shops in various places took advantage of the opportunity to raise and lower gold prices at will, manipulating the market for private gain. As a result, inland gold prices have been trending upward, with prices even exceeding world gold prices or Hong Kong gold prices. This has disrupted the financial market and hindered the future of the war of resistance more than anything else. The measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance specifically stipulate that the value of gold jewelry shall be based on the value jointly determined by silver shops and the Central Bank, or the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, aiming to prohibit arbitrary raising or lowering of prices in order to stabilize market gold prices.</p>
<p>Increasing Reserves</p>
<p>The measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance stipulate that all gold bars, gold nuggets, gold leaves, placer gold, and ore gold stored throughout the country, as well as gold items that are not in the shape of ornaments, shall be sold to the Central Bank to directly increase foreign exchange reserves, which indirectly protects the credit of legal tender. However, in order to take care of the business of merchants and civilians, silver shops are still allowed to continue to collect or sell red gold and 90% gold bullion in the shape of ornaments and utensils, and may be entrusted by the Central Bank to collect gold items that are not in the shape of ornaments and utensils, as well as placer gold and ore gold.</p>
<p>Freedom for the People</p>
<p>The central government has promoted the movement of thrift and frugality in many ways, but the people still follow old habits, either using gold items as ornaments and various utensils, or storing gold items in cellars and transporting them abroad, which violates the principle of thrift and frugality and hinders the strength of the war of resistance. The government stipulates that gold items stored by the people that are not in the shape of ornaments and utensils should be sold to the Central Bank, while gold items in the shape of ornaments and utensils are still allowed to be freely bought and sold or processed and transformed by the people in silver shops. This still implies that civil habits are not rejected in the ban of cash flight.</p>

<p>According to Modern News Agency, the Japanese and puppet troops who invaded Qidong and Haimen counties in northern Jiangsu, after occupying the ports along the Yangtze River last year, have recently been severely attacked by Li Mingyang's troops. The Japanese and puppets suffered heavy losses and, due to insufficient troop deployment, have retreated. According to a visitor from Haimen yesterday, when the Japanese troops had not yet retreated, plainclothes teams dispatched by regular Chinese troops had posted slogans in various towns along the river. The Japanese troops, suspecting that the main force had arrived, were terrified. Gunfire erupted at night, chilling the Japanese and puppets to the bone. On the seventh of this month, at dawn, they boarded gunboats and left in droves. Now, the ports along the Yangtze River in Qidong and Haimen counties are still guarded by Chinese troops dispatched to their original defense areas. Local order has been restored. All foreign merchant ships sailing to Beisha have resumed normal operations, and cargo transportation is being actively adjusted by the administrative organs of the two counties, and it can be restored to its old appearance in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e56">To Increase Funding for the War of Resistance: Various Provinces Implement Monopoly System; Zhejiang Province Has Already Implemented Monopoly of Cigarettes and Matches; Expansion Will Be Considered After Trial Implementation Proves Effective <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>In order to increase funding for the war of resistance, the Chinese government has decided to implement a monopoly system, which will first be promoted by the provincial governments. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Government's trial implementation of the cigarette monopoly has been effective, and it has also implemented a match monopoly, which is also managed by the Cigarette Management Office. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>After Management</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Times of Emergency, it was stipulated that cotton, silk, ramie, wool and their products, food, vegetable oil, tea, sugar, leather, wood, salt, coal, coke, kerosene, gasoline, diesel oil, lubricating oil, alcohol, cement, lime, matches, glass, bricks, tiles, fertilizers, electrical machinery tools, educational equipment, transportation equipment, and minerals shall be subject to management. When necessary, they may be nationalized or jointly operated with investment. Unless approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, they may not cease operations, suspend operations, or stop work. At the same time, the entire or part of them may be purchased at fair prices. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective.</p>
<p>Implementing Monopoly</p>
<p>The monopoly system occupies an important position in finance. Therefore, in recent years, various countries have changed consumption taxes to a monopoly system in order to enrich the national treasury. Although the Chinese government has had plans for a monopoly in the past, none of them have been implemented. Now, because the monopoly system is the only good way to increase funding for the war of resistance, it has been decided that the provincial governments should first find ways to implement it. The goods that are suitable for a monopoly include tobacco, alcohol, tea, salt, sugar, matches, and cigarettes. It is heard that the Zhejiang Provincial Government, etc., will first handle the monopoly of tobacco and matches, and will consider expanding it after the trial implementation proves effective.</p>
<p>Effective Trial Implementation</p>
<p>After Zhejiang Province's trial implementation of the cigarette monopoly, it formulated the Wartime Match Monopoly Regulations, which were approved and implemented by the provincial government's 1029th resolution meeting. The Cigarette Management Office was designated to also manage the match monopoly. After receiving the order, the office has already completed preparations and will implement it from January 1st of this year. Regarding the match monopoly affairs in various places, relevant agencies shall be responsible for handling them. The county branch offices are specifically designated to also handle the match monopoly affairs within their jurisdiction, without setting up additional agencies, in order to save money. As for the Match Monopoly Regulations, they are omitted.</p>
<p>Benefits of Monopoly</p>
<p>Under the monopoly system: (1) Taxes and profits are combined into the monopoly price. These profits originally belonged to private individuals, but as a result of the monopoly, they are completely incorporated into the national treasury. (2) The method of taxation is adopted, but it cannot be guaranteed that there will be no tax evasion or leakage. Under the monopoly, because taxation is implied in the selling price, more complete results are obtained than with taxation. (3) The state must establish collection agencies for taxation, but the monopoly can save expenses. (4) Although the monopoly price is regulated, it can be increased at any time as needed for financial reasons, without hindering the national economy.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily, a Japanese newspaper in this city reported that last Thursday, British troops closed a puppet police station and threw mud at a photograph of former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, etc. Yesterday (the 8th), British Army Major Ashmore denied this, saying that when the puppet police station was closed, there were no photographs of Konoe or anyone else. This action was personally supervised by him, and the actual work was done by the puppet police themselves. As for the Japanese newspaper's claim that the puppet five-color flag was torn to shreds, Major Ashmore said that when the British troops were about to leave, they saw the flag, took it down, and handed it over to the puppet police. As for the claim that a puppet policeman was beaten by several British soldiers, it was not true. The Japanese newspaper also published a message from a semi-official news agency, criticizing Major Ashmore for his "arrogant" attitude when he met with representatives of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government," and also severely criticizing the British authorities. According to Major Ashmore, a Japanese person went to the British Army Headquarters to inquire about the reasons for closing the puppet police station. He met with the Japanese person and told him that the puppet police station was within the British Army's defense zone and was adjacent to the concession road. This was the main reason for closing it. The display of the five-color flag in the British Army's defense zone would be a source of discord between the two sides, and the British Army authorities also believed that this flag should not be displayed in the defense zone. He then explained to the Japanese person that the British Army authorities did not recognize the puppet police in this area.</p>

<p>Guerrilla forces in the area around Hongqiao Road, Qinghong Road, Huhang Road, and Humin Road in western Shanghai have recently been unusually active. In addition to the Japanese soldiers protecting the railway lines at the Lao Xin, Longhua, and Meilong Cuizhuang railway stations, there are a small number of Japanese soldiers stationed at Shanghai Middle School, Hongqiao Road, and Lincoln Road. However, the Japanese army is afraid of being intercepted by the guerrillas and does not dare to cross the Lei Chi River. Therefore, it buys over traitors to spy on the guerrillas' whereabouts. A person was arrested by Captain Qin in Chengjiaqiao, Hongqiao Road, the day before yesterday, and has been executed. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, a Shandong native named Yang was also arrested by Mei, the captain of the Zhongyi Salvation Army Brigade, in Guanzhang, at the southern end of Humin Road. A military reconnaissance paper issued by the Japanese was found in the lining of the suspect's clothes, as well as four Kangxi coins. After strict interrogation by Captain Mei, the suspect confessed to spying on military intelligence and revealed that there were more than ten people in the Shanghai West area. After obtaining the confession, Captain Mei executed the suspect by firing squad yesterday and notified all the teams to pay close attention to strict investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Sufficient to Maintain Legal Tender Reserves: China Has Abundant Silver Reserves; Monthly War of Resistance Consumption is Only 5 Million Gold Yuan; Foreign Exchange Rate Will Not Rise or Fall in Two Years <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, which has lasted for eighteen months, China's financial situation has remained stable and consolidated. According to the results of a thorough investigation by banking circles:</p>
<p>China's Current Silver Reserves</p>
<p>amount to 690 million yuan. This figure was obtained based on statistics on China's silver imports and exports over a fifty-year period from 1888 to 1938. It was also found that at the end of November 1937, the legal tender issuance amount was 1.683469 billion yuan, and by May 1938, the issuance amount had increased to 1.700532 billion yuan, that is, an additional 100.6 million yuan was issued between November of the previous year and May of the last year. As for the</p>
<p>Amount of Silver Stored in the United States,</p>
<p>as of the end of June 1938, there was still 84 million US dollars. When China originally had US dollars stored in the United States in November 1937, it was 84 million US dollars. Between June and June 1938, 63 million US dollars were used, and then the sale of 140 million ounces of silver replenished the 84 million US dollars. From this, it can be seen that</p>
<p>China's Monthly War of Resistance Consumption</p>
<p>is at most only 5 million gold yuan, and since the US dollars stored in the United States are the reserve for foreign exchange, the value of legal tender in foreign exchange will fluctuate between the current exchange rates, and there will not be a huge rise or fall. Moreover, after the implementation of the legal tender system, the export and use of silver are only between 500 million and 600 million yuan, which is more than enough to maintain the preparation of legal tender and foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, according to the observations of banking circles, if half of the remaining silver stored in the country can be used, its ability will not only be enough to increase the issuance of legal tender by 200 million yuan, but at the same time, it will continue to maintain the current foreign exchange rate for two years.</p>

<p>The Korean People's League, organized by Koreans residing in China, has issued a letter to the Chinese people, expressing deep sympathy for the Chinese government's 18 months of resistance and supporting General Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of China's war of resistance, and paying tribute to the officers fighting on the front lines. The letter to the Chinese people states, in essence, that since the Chinese government began resisting the Japanese army, it has lasted for 18 months. Under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, the entire Chinese army and people are in high spirits and have no intention of retreating, shattering the Japanese dream of a "quick war and quick victory." The Japanese army has now deployed more than one million troops to the east, west, and north of China, which can be said to have exhausted its efforts, but the result is only the occupation of a part of the cities. The control of the villages is entirely in the hands of the Chinese army. This result is sufficient to form China's victory. The day when the 450 million people of China are liberated is also the day when the 30 million people of Korea regain their freedom. Since Korea was destroyed by Japan, it has been 29 years. During these 29 years, all 30 million Koreans have been under heavy oppression. Their lives are worse than those of dogs and horses. Therefore, Koreans who have been destroyed for 29 years are eager for the victory of the motherland's war of resistance. China and Korea have the same history. The people of both countries have been suppressed by Japan in recent years. This decision for China to launch a full-scale war of resistance is not only to revitalize China, but also to save the weak and small nations of the world. With the unanimous support of the Korean people, we wish China's war of resistance to achieve final victory.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Dr. Baker Returns from Inspecting the Southwest: Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Guangdong All Suffer from Disease; Severe Housing Shortage in Kunming and Chongqing <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental Press, the Shanghai International Red Cross is about to publish a public announcement containing a report by Dr. Baker, a standing committee member of the China International Relief Committee. The report states that Hunan Province, northern Guangxi, eastern Jiangxi, and parts of Guangdong Province are suffering from a particularly severe epidemic of malaria, and the relief work to aid civilians suffering from disease and injuries is completely inadequate. Dr. Baker recently went to</p>
<p>Southwest Inspection</p>
<p>and reported on the relief situation before returning to Shanghai last month. Regarding the inability to cope with the relief situation in the interior, Dr. Baker cited two reasons: first, a lack of transportation, resulting in a shortage of medicine; and second, the dispiritedness of Chinese doctors and nurses. Concerning possible remedies, Dr. Baker proposed establishing a fund to operate regular automobile transportation services to evacuate hospital personnel close to the front lines. As for doctors and nurses whose</p>
<p>resolve is wavering</p>
<p>he believes it is because there is no guarantee of evacuation when Japanese troops arrive in the area. He heard that many doctors and nurses, fearing abandonment, were already abandoning their posts before it was absolutely necessary. Dr. Baker praised the national government's plan to provide as much assistance as possible to wartime refugees. According to Dr. Baker, dispersing refugees to rural areas some distance from highways and railways is the most effective way to reduce the suffering of ordinary people. Dr. Baker</p>
<p>after the Changsha fire</p>
<p>arrived in the area soon after. Although the properties of some churches, such as the American Presbyterian Church, remained intact, many other churches in the city were reduced to ashes. With a few exceptions, the Changsha relief program was smooth and very effective. While staying in the ruined city, Dr. Baker met refugees scattered in the countryside and saw refugees presenting their identification papers and being given relocation subsidies. During this inspection, Dr. Baker</p>
<p>traveled through six provinces</p>
<p>covering a distance of 3,700 miles. Due to transportation difficulties, he traveled by sampan in some areas. He took a ship from Hong Kong to Haikou, determined to see the malaria epidemic now rampant in southwestern China. It is said that although many fishermen in Beihai and Haikou have become wartime refugees in the area, this is not the main relief problem in the area. In Kunming, Chengdu, and Chongqing, the housing problem is even more severe than the refugee problem. Near Chengdu and Chongqing, there are</p>
<p>wartime orphans</p>
<p>who are supervised and cared for by Madame Chiang. It is estimated that the cost of maintaining each orphan is only five yuan per month. Kunming and Chongqing are experiencing a severe housing shortage due to the influx of refugees from the Yangtze River basin and South China, making it difficult for both the rich and the poor to find a place to live. In Kunming, there is no refugee problem at all. The situation in Guiyang is very similar to that in Yunnan and Sichuan, but a large number of Chinese doctors and nurses have fled to the area from the war zone or</p>
<p>war-threatened</p>
<p>areas. When Dr. Baker arrived in Guizhou, the provincial government's relief plan had not yet been implemented, but Dr. Baker believed that shortly after he left Guizhou, the plan would be put into practice. The plan includes establishing a registration station on the Hunan-Guizhou border highway, the only route from Hunan to Guizhou. Farmers, builders, and metalworkers entering Guizhou Province will be directed to Guiyang by the station. Upon arrival, merchants and workers will begin working in the suburbs of Guiyang, while farmers will be sent further into the</p>
<p>interior for cultivation</p>
<p>Dr. Baker traveled by car from Guiyang to Liuzhou and Guilin in Guangxi Province. Liuzhou still has no refugee problem, but it is quite unsettled due to refugees passing through and treating civilians injured in air raids. The local church is currently engaged in relief work, and the county government is also cooperating to deal with the situation. Guilin urgently needs medicine to treat injured civilians and refugees from Guangzhou who are sick along the way. In addition, there is</p>
<p>disease epidemic</p>
<p>The Guilin County Government has formulated a plan to disperse refugees, but the implementation of these plans is hampered by a lack of funds. However, some missionaries have organized an international relief committee to help alleviate the refugee situation. Dr. Baker then traveled from Guangxi to Hengyang, Hunan, and saw that most of the churches there were deserted, and the doctors and nurses in the hospitals had retreated elsewhere</p>
<p>transportation is convenient</p>
<p>Therefore, transportation for the shipment of supplies and the evacuation of civilians is urgently needed. It is now a problem to care for the wounded soldiers in the city, but the county government's plan to relieve the wounded is still being implemented.

<p>Guo Chiping, commander of the Ningbo garrison, telegraphed the shipping industry in this city yesterday, temporarily prohibiting Ningbo-Dinghai-Taizhou ships from docking at Dinghai.

<p>The Tangsai, a ship of the American-owned China Merchants Navigation Company, and the Meda, a ship of the Portuguese-owned Merry Company, originally sailed on the Shanghai-Taizhou-Ningbo line. They were then notified by the Ningbo authorities to prohibit sailing from Taizhou to Shanghai. Therefore, the two ships complied and only sailed on the Ningbo-Taizhou line, also serving Bay Dinghai and Shipu. Unexpectedly, on New Year's Eve last year, a misunderstanding and conflict occurred in Dinghai between guerrillas and resident police. All transports suspended sailing to Dinghai. Subsequently, as order was restored, Tangsai and other transports also resumed serving Bay. Yesterday, China Merchants Navigation Company and others received a telegram from Guo Chiping, commander of the Ningbo garrison, notifying them to temporarily prohibit Tangsai and Meda from docking at Dinghai and Shipu. After receiving the order, the companies decided to comply and sail directly on the Shanghai-Taizhou line from today. It is reported that the Tianbao and Libao, which originally sailed on the Ningbo-Dinghai route, have also been temporarily suspended. In addition, after Shanghai-Taizhou transports were banned from Bay Dinghai, no order has been received to restore it. Therefore, navigation to Dinghai has been completely interrupted.

<p>According to the Continental Press, Prince Hussein of Yemen stated to reporters yesterday (the 8th) that Yemen is deeply concerned about the suffering of Chinese Muslims due to the Japanese invasion and urgently called on all Muslims to unite in this time of global turmoil. The reporter interviewed the prince at the Cathay Hotel. It is said that I find it difficult to talk about any events concerning China, because I know very little about China and feel that I should not talk about it. I am staying in Shanghai briefly, compelled by miscellaneous matters, and even have no time to meet with local Muslim leaders. But I can say that the people of our country are deeply concerned about the developments in China and agree that these developments affect Chinese Muslims. In recent years, the war has spread north, affecting many Muslims. As the world continues to be turbulent, all Muslims must unite. Events in Arabia have forced Muslims there to begin to unite. Muslim countries around the world will follow suit, not only as a religious movement but also as a political and economic force. Prince Hussein recently arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo by plane, stayed for only four days, and then flew to Japan yesterday. When asked about his purpose in going to Tokyo, he did not admit that this trip had a political mission, saying that he went to Japan last May to open a new mosque in Tokyo and hoped to assist in the development of Islam in Japan to the best of his ability. He will return to Shanghai soon, but cannot say for sure when. If he does return to Shanghai, he hopes to stay longer to study the local situation.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the rice market this year, due to the balance of production and sales and the large amount of rice in storage, rice prices have remained at the closing prices at the end of last year. However, in the past day or two, due to the cold weather, inland water transportation has been more difficult, and the arrival of goods has been slightly affected. It is now estimated that only three to four thousand bags of rice arrive at the port each day, a decrease of one to two thousand bags compared to last week. Rice prices in the Shanghai market have rebounded slightly by two or three cents in the past two days. The highest price of japonica rice is currently 12.45 yuan per picul. Medium-sized rice shops, due to their large inventory, and brokerage firms, due to their busy transactions, have also seen prices rise uniformly. According to the rice industry, rice prices in the Shanghai market always rise at the beginning of the lunar year and the end of the lunar year, but this is due to the cold winter and has little impact on the overall market price. Prices will drop after the end of the lunar new year.</p>

<p>Mao Yusheng, a local resident living at No. 127 Longjiang Road, has three sons. Suddenly, on October 24 last year, his three sons were arrested and detained by the Japanese Command on suspicion of stealing cotton. After many days had passed without their release, Yusheng was very anxious about the fate of his three sons. A nephew, Mao Lianlian, introduced him to a friend, Jiang Buting, from Haimen, who claimed that he could find a way to release the three sons, but demanded a reward of 300 yuan for expenses. Mao Yusheng agreed at the time, and paid 100 yuan first on November 18, which Jiang Buting transferred to Lu Xuhong, a comprador at Xinlong Foreign Firm at No. 209 Yuanmingyuan Road, to handle. Four days later, Yusheng paid another 200 yuan because his sons had not yet been released. Unexpectedly, another month passed without any news, and when he went to Xinlong Foreign Firm to inquire, the firm had closed down and the building was empty. Mao Yusheng realized that he had been deceived, but could not find Jiang Buting, so he reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station. It was not until the morning of the day before yesterday that Hua Detective Xie Wanfang arrested Jiang Buting in Room 5 of Jinsheng Inn on Fujian Road, and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, filed a lawsuit for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and presented the case, requesting a postponement on the grounds that the principal offender was at large. According to Mao Yusheng, together with witness Mao Lianlian, who complained about everything, Jiang Buting was questioned and only admitted to being a witness, and denied any fraud. Judge Fang verified the confession and ruled that Jiang be detained and the hearing be rescheduled for next Wednesday.</p>

They immediately reported it to the police station and sent him to the hospital for treatment by car. He was deeply poisoned and his life was in great danger. It is said that the reason for his suicide was due to economic pressure.</p>

After Peng reported it to the French Police Station, the detectives first detained Peng Jiakang and sent him to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Kanaev and others were also arrested in the Public Concession for posing as detectives to search for and confiscate opium, and a postponement was requested so that they could be transferred to the case for joint trial. Since Kanaev and others committed the crime in the Public Concession, the First Special Court has already tried the case. The French Police Station sent detectives the day before yesterday to transfer the six criminals, including the Russian Kanaev, Chinese Zhou Yifeng, Chen Fuming, Wang Fugui, Gao Yunpeng, and Bao Shida, to court.

When Shanghai fell, Fang took his family, gold jewelry, clothing, etc., and moved to Xiamusi Road in the French Concession. The house in the city was assigned to two male servants, Lu Afu and Jin Baochun, to guard it. They were robbed by bandits twice, and all the rosewood furniture and valuables were looted. The two servants, Lu and Jin, were beaten twice by the bandits, making it impossible for them to live in peace. They returned to the master in the concession to report, but there was nothing they could do. In recent days, the bandits, because there was nothing to rob, started demolishing the house, first selling the doors, windows, and panels, and then selling the bricks, tiles, and wood. Now the giant mansion has been turned into a flat ground.</p>
<p>Li Fuxing Rosewood Workshop, opened by Li Fusheng at No. 31, Yinying Temple Road, at the end of Penglai Road inside Ximen, when the suburbs fell, Li hired people to transport the finished rosewood furniture, etc., to the western part of Fuli Road in the French Concession and rented a house to store it.

It turned out that the kidnapped person was named Tang Maonan, who is the current battalion commander of the Third Detachment of the Jiangzhe Border Region Guerrilla Force under his command. He had recently engaged in combat with the Japanese army in the Y窩沙 (Ya Wo Sha) area outside of Wusongkou, posing a considerable threat.

In August of last year, Zhou Limin's wife in Ningbo learned about her husband's situation in Shanghai and came to Shanghai to live with her husband at 55 Yongji Lane. Every day, she urged her husband to separate from the prostitute, abandon evil, and return to righteousness. For the past two or three months, Zhou Limin has not gone to Zhou Xiujuan's place. Zhou, due to the interruption of income, has experienced financial difficulties. She still wanted to lure Limin to her, and tried to visit him many times but could not meet him. Last night at 7:00 PM, she again went to meet with Limin and went with him to a secret rendezvous at the Shunxing Inn on Guba Road in the French Concession. It is unknown what happened, but she bit off the tip of Limin's tongue, causing him to bleed profusely and scream in extreme pain. The tea attendant heard the noise and entered, seeing a person lying on the ground moaning. He immediately went out to report to the Chinese police. The Chinese police, upon receiving the report, immediately went to investigate. The prostitute, seeing the Chinese police arrive, pretended to be dead on the ground, not responding when called and not moving when pushed. Zhou Limin was sent to Tongren Hospital, and Zhou Xiujuan was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's examination, it was determined that Xiujuan was not injured.

It was discovered that the employees had profited from the company by secretly collecting commissions, causing the company to lose 30,000 yuan. The comprador Zhang Bingchu and others delayed settling and clearing the accounts, so the company commissioned lawyer Jiang Bao to publish a warning in the newspaper, setting a deadline for account settlement. Zhang and others also published rebuttals in the newspaper. While the two sides were negotiating, Chen Zhengmin, the elder brother of Chen Zhengzhi, the deputy business director of the company, also joined in demanding payment from Xu Guansheng because the company owed him a deposit and commission. On the afternoon of December 20th, Xu Guansheng and Wang Yigong received threatening letters from Chen Zhengmin, each with strong language. It was believed that Chen Zhengmin was colluding with the comprador, deputy comprador, business director, and deputy business director. They reported the matter to the French police, who arrested and detained Chen Zhengmin, Zhang Bingchu, Chen Zhongwen, Li Ganchen, and Chen Zhengzhi and sent them to the Second Special Court requesting detention for investigation, with a new hearing scheduled. As reported in this newspaper, Judge Zhang Minsheng continued the trial at the Criminal Court One yesterday morning.顾守熙 (Gu Shouxi), the lawyer representing the French Concession administration, presented the case and prosecuted based on Article 346 of the Criminal Law for the crime of intimidation. The defendants hired lawyers such as Wang Shizong and Zuo De. The first plaintiff, Xu Guansheng, did not appear due to illness; the second plaintiff, Wang Yigong, appeared and stated the situation of organizing the company's business and discovering the comprador and directors</p>
<p>colluding to commit fraud, urging them to settle and clear the accounts, and receiving threatening letters. Defendant Chen Zhengmin confessed that because Hengren Shipping Company owed him water fare, deposit, and commission, he came to Shanghai to demand payment from Xu Guansheng. Because Xu refused to meet him several times, he wrote a letter urging him to settle the matter as soon as possible. He admitted to the threatening letter incident. The remaining defendants, Zhang Bingchu, Chen Shenwen, Li Ganchen, and Chen Zhengzhi, all denied being involved with the threatening letter. The court ordered a new hearing on the 13th. The defendants each submitted a guarantee of 2,000 yuan and were released on bail with a guarantor who could be summoned at any time. Those without a guarantor were detained.</p>

<p>Chen Xiaotang, from Chaozhou, used to operate a soil business in Ji畝地 (Jiu Mu Di). Since the outbreak of the war, he moved to 23 Baokang Lane, Xiafei Road, and secretly sold opium soil for considerable profit. On the morning of the 7th of this month, Chen and his family member Chen You (also known as A Long, 22 years old) went to Caojiadu to purchase 50 taels of opium. He ordered Chen You to tie it to his chest and transport it home by car. While traveling to the intersection of Beile Road and K愷自邇路 (K愷自邇路), they were inspected by French police detectives Jiang Changwen and Chen Wenbin, and patrol officers. Chen You's chest was protruding, which was suspicious. They searched him and found the opium soil. After taking him to the police station, they went to his home to arrest Chen Xiaotang. Because he had not yet returned home, only his wife, Chen Li, was arrested. Yesterday afternoon, they were jointly sent to Criminal Court One of the Second Special Court, requesting that the investigation be rescheduled to arrest the fugitive mastermind Chen Xiaotang and investigate the matter together. After questioning by Judge Zhang Minsheng, he ordered a new hearing on the 18th. The defendants were returned to detention.</p>

<p>After the opening of the war zone in the suburbs of Shanghai, although some poor people have moved back to live there, there are too many organizations, military power is higher than "police" power, "police" power is higher than "judicial" power, and management is complex. The people have no so-called "legal" protection. It is found that in the area under the jurisdiction of the fake "Caojiadu Police Sub-bureau" in West Shanghai, due to the rampant gambling and opium dens, and the rise of bandits, it has long become a world of terror. Last year, three civilians lost huge sums of money in gambling dens and had no way to make a living. They took the risk of robbing pedestrians on the road. One acted as a lookout, one robbed four corners (of currency), and one robbed eight corners. Unexpectedly, they were captured by the fake "police," and three fake pistols were found. The criminals were detained in the fake "Sub-bureau," subjected to private torture, and treated as major thieves with shackles and handcuffs. They were privately detained for five or six months. The former instructor sentenced them to death and sent them to the fake "Judicial Office" in Pudong for execution. However, the fake "Office" considered that the three men's situation was excusable, and a sentence of one or two years of imprisonment would be sufficient, and there was no plaintiff. When questioning the criminals, they all denied committing the robbery, saying they were coerced by the fake "police" using torture such as the "tiger bench" and "waterboarding" (i.e., pouring cold water down their noses) to extract confessions. The fake "Judicial Office" considered the evidence in this case to be insufficient, removed the instruments of torture, and ordered that they await "appropriate sentencing." Unexpectedly, the fake "Police Bureau" urged the execution, saying it was instructed by the Japanese side to handle it this way. The fake "judge" refused to obey and cried out "Bullshit, bullshit!" The fake "police" fled in dismay. It is heard that due to the dispute over this case, a major conflict has brewed between the fake "Judicial Office" and the fake "Shanghai West Sub-bureau," and it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>

<p>The Nanshi fake "Local Court" received a report from a local bailiff in West Shanghai, saying that an unidentified male corpse, about 30 years old, wearing short clothes with knife wounds, was found outside Caojiadu in the opium and gambling district. However, the fake "prosecutor" and fake "inspector" etc., because the journey was inconvenient, ordered the bailiff to carry the corpse to the court for inspection. Therefore, this case is still the first one, and the fake "court law" also began to collect 5 角 (jiao) of silver.</p>

<p>At about 10:45 AM yesterday, in the Dasheng gambling den in 忻康里 (Xin Kang Li) at the intersection of 极司非而路 (Jisi Feier Road) and 康腦脫路 (Kang Nao Tuo Road) in West Shanghai, just as the gambling den was preparing to open, a middle-aged man holding a hand grenade suddenly mixed among the gamblers and threw it towards the gambling den's hall. However, the grenade did not explode. The rogues who worked as bouncers in the gambling den, and two fake policemen stationed in the den, were shocked and quickly drew their Mauser pistols and fired at the grenade-throwing man. The man did not show weakness and also returned fire. Thus, a fierce fight broke out. The general gamblers, caught in the rain of bullets, were frightened out of their wits and fled for their lives, causing chaos. The grenade-throwing man retreated while fighting, and seemed to have other companions protecting him, and fled towards Caojiadu, before the fighting finally stopped. In total, both sides fired more than 20 shots. An old woman living in 忻康里 (Xin Kang Li), Zhu Sunshi, was injured by a stray bullet, breaking her left shoulder bone, and was subsequently sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After this incident occurred, the police方面 (fangmian) have taken strict precautions in the border area and are inspecting pedestrians, so the general bad guys have nowhere to hide. As for the origin of the incident, it was due to a dispute over business between someone in the gambling den and the gambling den owner.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Chauffeur of Yuan Shikai's Sixth Son Scams Huge Sum of Money; Falsely Sells Master's Car, Defrauds Over Three Thousand Gold; Knowing That Matters Will Be Exposed, Colludes with Accomplices to Hire Lawyer in Advance <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The sixth son of the late President Yuan Shikai, known as Yuan Laoliu, currently resides at 7, Lane 108, Huanyulong Road in the French Concession. The car he drives is a 1937 Ford model, which is not considered old. His hired driver, Liang Alin from Haidou, heard but did not forget his master's words about replacing old cars with new ones. Last month, Liang was driving the car and parked it outside the Yuan residence,</p>
<p>waiting for his master. It happened that the chauffeur of Tian Baixiang, a Cantonese who works at the Heji 洋行 (Heji Yanghang) on Sichuan Road, who lived in the neighboring residence, was also driving a car and waiting outside the door for his employer. The two drivers were very close to each other, so they chatted casually. Hu, because his master was eager to buy a car and saw Liang's car, asked Liang about the car owner's name. Liang knew Hu's intentions and took the opportunity to lie that his car owner was planning to sell it. Hu immediately returned to tell his master, and Tian Baixiang ordered his representative to negotiate with the other party. Liang first demanded a deposit of 200 法幣 (fabbi), and refused to issue a receipt with the excuse that the master had gone to Hong Kong and the wife could not sign it.</p>
<p>The receipt for the money was never issued. Hu said that the deposit he paid was temporarily borrowed from others. Since he did not receive a receipt, it was difficult to get the money from his foolish master, so he negotiated with Liang every day. Until the 7th of this month, Liang Hu finally agreed on the car price of 3,500 法幣 (fabbi). Although Hu asked to meet the car owner, he was ultimately rejected by Liang, who said that only the goods and money needed to be exchanged, why make things complicated? Hu's master initially planned to pay with a bank check, but Liang also used excuses to shirk it off, so he agreed to pay in cash. The date was set for noon on the 8th at 75 Mou'er Wulu Lane. When the date arrived, Tian Baixiang ordered his 18-year-old son, Tian Younian, to carry</p>
<p>a bag of 法幣 (fabbi), totaling 3,500 yuan, and take his own car, still driven by Hu Mingchu, to the predetermined location. Liang Alin was already waiting alone. After receiving the money, he turned around and entered a house in the lane. He came out after a long time and said that his master had taken the car he wanted to sell to visit friends on Ximolu, and the received car price had been transferred to his wife. Later, after Tian Hu and his servants urged him, he had no chance to escape, so he reluctantly led Tian Hu to drive to Ximolu, setting up delaying excuses all the way, until 5:00 PM,</p>
<p>no car was seen. Tian and others questioned him sternly. Liang's attitude suddenly changed, claiming that Tian Hu was extorting. So the master and servant joined forces to twist Liang to the 静安寺 (Jing'an Temple) police station. Under the investigation of the police chief, Liang still denied selling the car and embezzling the money, but later he confessed because he could not deny it. He admitted that he used the sale of the car as bait to swindle the money, which was all given to his relative Cao Cailin, who was hiding in the lane, to take back to Cao's residence at 8 Yu Qiaqing Road for storage. The police chief obtained the confession and immediately sent detectives Guan Huchen, detectives Lu Lianding, Wang Jiaobin, and</p>
<p>West detectives to his room to search under the bed, where they found the original payment. Upon inspection, it was found that 200 yuan was missing. According to Liang, the 200 yuan had been sent by Cao and Zhao Maolin to attorney Xu Jiazhi as public fees for hiring Xu to defend him. Because Liang knew that his matter was bound to be exposed, he had hired attorney Xu in advance on the night of the 7th through Zhao Maolin, the chauffeur dismissed by Xu Jia, in order to be defended. He initially did not pay, and after</p>
<p>swindling a large sum of money, he immediately ordered Cao Zhao to send the money. The detectives and others arrested Cao Zhao, who were accomplices, and went to attorney Xu's office to inquire. Attorney Xu then returned the original payment to the detectives. Yesterday morning, Liang, Cao, and Zhao were escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Dai Rongduo opened the Criminal Court Eight and interrogated them. The police lawyer Qian Ju Jiu stated the circumstances of the case, but because the 200 yuan paid by the car driver of the Tian family to the defendant was</p>
<p>still missing, it was still necessary to request a change of date to facilitate the investigation. Then, Tian Baixiang and his son, and his car driver Hu Mingchu, separately stated the beginning and end of the incident. The court then questioned Liang Alin, who fully admitted everything, saying that his master had no intention of selling the car. Hu had just joked at the time, but later he was given a deposit of 200 yuan, which he took to the gambling den and lost. He then decided to take the opportunity to cheat, etc. The two defendants Cao Zhao both refused to take responsibility. Judge Dai then ordered a new hearing on another day.</p>

<p>Zhou Kaiwen, a Chinese detective from the General Police Station, learned the other day that someone would smuggle a large amount of opium soil from Pudong to Shanghai for sale, so he secretly waited near the Bund on Jiujiang Road. At 4:20 PM, he saw three women, Sun Liushi, Zhao Liushi, and Li Sanjie, coming from Pudong. After landing, he saw that Sun Liushi's</p>
<p>abdomen was swollen, as if she were pregnant, but her buttocks were not raised high, which was suspicious. He reported back to the police chief and, together with a female search officer, stopped the three women and searched them. He found three large bags of opium soil on each of them, totaling 27 and a half pounds. He took them to the police station together and questioned them, who confessed that the opium soil was entrusted to them by Zhang Jinsheng and Yaozi, who lived in Pudong,</p>
<p>to be brought to Shanghai and delivered to 247 Fujian Road, for which they would receive a reward of five yuan. The detectives went to 247 Fujian Road to investigate, but it was closed and there was no one there. He detained the three women, and yesterday morning he sent them to Criminal Court One of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baolin prosecuted them according to Article 5 of the Opium Suppression and Punishment Regulations, and described</p>
<p>the case. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. Judge Xiao ruled in court that Sun Liushi, Zhao Liushi, and Li Sanjie were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment for transporting opium, and the opium soil was confiscated.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Educational Association, in order to concentrate the power of all educational groups in the city to promote the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" in the Shanghai educational circles, has contacted the Shanghai Private Secondary School Advancement Association, the Shanghai Secondary School Federation, the Shanghai Secondary School Advancement Association, the Shanghai Secondary School Staff Federation, the Shanghai Secondary School Moral Education Directors Research Association, the Shanghai Primary School Education Advancement Association, etc., to jointly promote it. The letter to the members issued by these groups is recorded below. China's strategy is a protracted war, and only through persistence can it transition from a relative advantage to an absolute advantage. After a year and six months of the War of Resistance, not only have the army and the people been forged into revolutionary bastions in the volcanoes and seas of blood, but also international trends have inevitably become increasingly favorable to China with the development of the War of Resistance. In the past, we deeply felt the sympathy and assistance of all democratic countries towards China. Recently, the United Kingdom and the United States have given economic support in the political sense. This is certainly an inevitable trend in the development of international contradictions, but the kindness of friendly countries is worthy of twelve points of gratitude. Originally, the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation were to be fought for through self-reliance, not entirely dependent on foreign aid. We certainly welcome and need friendly countries to aid China for justice and peace. However, what China needs assistance with is even greater than this. Therefore, this debt repayment loan can be repaid based on the national self-reliance principle. The "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement" has been launched one after another by all sectors of Shanghai. All members of our association should actively respond, because in this way, the friendly countries will be stimulated by the Chinese people's fervent emotions and will be more determined to take the correct path in the Far East. It is very possible for international peace organizations to be formed from this, and for fascist powers to become weak. It all depends on the intensity of our struggle.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Supplementary Education Association Stipulates Outline of Behavioral Training for Vocational Youth (Part Two) Striving to Cultivate a Completely Independent Personality and a Spirit of Serving and Transforming Society <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Training Methods</p>
<p>Part Two (4) The methods of vocational youth behavioral training. In terms of individuals, they should develop self-education methods. In terms of groups, they should develop collective education methods. (5) Methods of self-education. (1) Self-reading: Use spare time to develop an interest in reading and develop reading ability. (2) Observe things: Observe social and life phenomena from your own vocational life to strengthen your own life knowledge. (3) Self-criticism: Be open-minded to analyze yourself, learn from others' strengths and make up for your own shortcomings. At the same time, you must be able to correct your own shortcomings in time and promote your own strengths. (6) Methods of collective education. (1) Collective research: Use spare time to carry out spare time activities, gather colleagues, and put forward problems for joint research. (2) Collective action: Participate in various social activities and absorb social experience in the activities to enrich your own basic knowledge. (3) Mutual criticism: Point out each other's advantages and disadvantages, supervise and encourage each other. This is the best way to achieve a healthy life.</p>
<p>Training Paths</p>
<p>Part Three (7) The path of vocational youth behavioral training is to grasp the reality and determine the individual and collective behavioral policies that are suitable for the actual situation. (8) Grasp the reality. (1) Analysis of various social phenomena: Collect materials, analyze the causes and practical significance of the reality. (2) Research on the realistic environment in which you are located: Analyze your own existence from reality, and look at reality from your own existence. (3) Determine your attitude towards reality: If reality is beneficial to you, how should you strive for these beneficial conditions? Otherwise, how should you overcome the difficulties of this reality? (9) Reality and collective behavior. (1) Determine the scope of collective behavior based on realistic conditions, such as national or local, down to the smallest industrial sector. (2) Determine the guidelines for collective action based on realistic conditions. Absolutely avoid blind actions, and also oppose excessive movements that are divorced from reality. A certain policy should be set under certain conditions. (3) Determine the steps of action based on realistic conditions. There must be a scope of action, a policy, and also certain steps, that is, the stages of action. This will prevent confusion and enable you to realize your own views in a planned way.</p>
<p>Highest Goal</p>
<p>Part Four (10) The current stage of behavioral training for vocational youth is to strive for personal freedom and national independence as the highest goals. (11) Personal freedom. (1) Freedom of speech and publication. (2) Freedom of assembly and association. (3) Freedom of action. (12) National independence. (1) National independence and personal freedom are inseparable. Without national independence, personal freedom will be empty. (2) Personal freedom is organically related to national independence. Striving for personal freedom is the first step in striving for national independence. Of course, after national independence, individuals will gain more extensive freedom. (3) Striving for freedom is the common goal of the Chinese people at present. Vocational youth are naturally of the same fate. (13) Conditions for completing the task. (1) Personal and collective actions must be completed from the highest principles. (2) It is necessary to obtain practical methods. (3) There must be practical paths. With these three, the historical mission undertaken by vocational youth can be completed. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e108">School Overview: Wuxi Middle School <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi Middle School was founded in the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920) by educator Gao Jiansi, who donated 50,000 yuan in accordance with his father Qiuquan's will. At that time, the school board hired Tang Weizhi, the former president of Shanghai Nanyang University, as the principal. He served for ten years, planning and managing the school on a grand scale. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), it was approved for registration by the Jiangsu Education Department. Later, through the efforts of successive principals and the support of people from all walks of life, the facilities became increasingly perfect, and it enjoyed a considerable reputation in Jiangsu Province. The school's curriculum is aimed at connecting with the courses of Jiaotong University. Most of the graduates have entered Jiaotong University and other famous universities in China. Talents have emerged one after another, making great contributions. Last winter, when Wuxi was occupied, the school was temporarily disbanded. This summer, the school principal, Mr. Zhou Zhenbo, in response to the requirements of students' parents, consulted with Qian Sunqing, Tang Weizhi, Gao Jiansi, and other school board members, and relocated the school to Shanghai. He leased a building at No. 451 Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, as a temporary school building. At the same time, he reported to the Education Department, and soon received Instruction No. 4989 from Huai, approving the record. The school is now divided into six grades of senior and junior high school, with more than 200 students. The hired teachers, such as Shen Hong, Sheng Shuzhou, Wu Gaiting, Shen Zuifeng, Zhang Qifu, Guo Jinyang, Lu Renbo, Qian Zhonghan, Gao Naian, Wang Yaode, Wu Youmei, Jiang Wenhua, Zhang Yuanbai, etc., are all learned scholars. All the facilities in the school are still based on the educational purpose and the past spirit of the school. Teaching management is practical, and coursework is serious. Each senior high school grade has 30 hours of instruction per week, and each junior high school grade has 28 hours of instruction per week, which meets the standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education. The tuition fee is 32 yuan per semester for senior high school and 28 yuan per semester for junior high school. Recently, Lin Xisheng and Ding Houqing of this city, considering the school's long history and outstanding reputation, have specially approved the establishment of 18 scholarships in the school from the next semester. The scholarship amount is 35 yuan per semester for each senior high school student and 25 yuan per semester for each junior high school student. All new and old students of the school who are from poor families and have excellent character and learning have the hope of obtaining this scholarship. At the same time, the school also added six free places to show encouragement. Other than that, the equipment of instruments and the purchase of books are all strived to be enriched to benefit the students. Once transportation is convenient, it is also planned to transport the instruments and books stored in Wuxi to Shanghai for application.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Jiangsu Education Department's Recent Educational Administrative Facilities (Part One): Compiling Education Fee Budgets, Inspecting Schools in Various Counties, Promoting Education in Guerrilla Areas, and Restoring Free Education <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Since taking office, Ma Yuanfang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, has spared no effort in rectifying and promoting various aspects of education in the province. The following is a summary of the recent important work of the department:</p>
<p>(1) Compiling Administrative Plans</p>
<p>The 28th-year educational administrative plan has been compiled by the Education Department and is divided into two major parts: career and economy. In terms of career, the guerrilla area part is divided into five items: (1) Improving and strengthening the educational administrative institutions in the guerrilla area; (2) Sorting out, maintaining, and improving secondary education; (3) Restoring local education; (4) Promoting social education; (5) Promoting the free education system. The complete area part is divided into five items: (1) Handling provincial middle and primary schools and vocational science grades; (2) Rectifying local education; (3) Actively promoting compilation and review work; (4) Finding ways to handle the supply of books and newspapers; (5) Investigating the provincial and county libraries and instruments, and finding ways to collect, store, and manage them, and utilize them. In terms of funding, (1) Efforts should be made to make the provincial and county education fee budget income and expenditure suitable; (2) Restricting emerging undertakings and construction purchases; (3) Clearing up school property and rectifying school rents; (4) Stipulating the standards for school fees to be levied and exempted, and earnestly rectifying school fee income; (5) Clearing up the deposits of provincial and county educational institutions in the occupied areas and provincial educational institutions that have been suspended due to the war; (6) Urging provincial and county educational institutions to handle reporting and handover on schedule, and settle accounts daily, in order to emphasize political accounting; (7) Raising subsidies to restore education in the occupied areas and maintain compulsory education classes. This administrative plan will be submitted to the provincial government for approval.</p>
<p>(2) Compiling a Budget Summary of Education Fees</p>
<p>The 28th-year budget summary of income and expenditure of provincial educational institutions has been compiled in accordance with the 28th-year administrative plan. In addition to listing the two fees for the management institutions of eight secondary schools and seven primary schools, it also adds subsidies for secondary school vocational education work groups, complete counties for handling compulsory education classes, and education funds for subsidized occupied counties. This budget summary will be submitted to the provincial government for approval.</p>
<p>(3) Dispatching Personnel to Inspect Education</p>
<p>Educational supervision is extremely important. A provincial school inspector supervision meeting was held, stipulating the supervision areas, dispatching school inspector Xie Bin to supervise Dongtai, Taixing, Suqian, and Jiangdu counties, school inspector Yan Gongwei to supervise Gaoyou, Funing, Donghai, Muyang, Guanyun, and Yiwei counties, school inspector Li Wanyu to supervise Huaian, Lianshui, Yancheng, Shiying, Ganyu, Rugao, and Liuhe counties, and school inspector Zhang Yiyan to supervise Huaiyin, Siyang, Xinghua, and Taixian counties. All local education in the above counties and the various provincial temporary secondary schools and provincial primary schools in the counties are being supervised separately, and another school inspector is dispatched to secretly inspect the education in the counties south of the Yangtze River and the schools that have relocated to Shanghai to resume classes.</p>

<p>The private Wuxi Jingzhi Girls' Middle School has perfect management and strict training. Students' academic status accounts for three-tenths of the provinces, and has a history of 34 years. Graduates serve in 17 provinces. Since the school building in Wuxi was bombed in 1937, the founder, Hou Baosan, relocated to Shanghai to resume classes in order to help students who had lost their schooling. Last year, it first borrowed Wangjiasha, and then borrowed No. 451 Jiangxi Road as a temporary school address. Now, in order to accelerate students' studies and expand school affairs, it has moved to the new school building at No. 30, Cihou Nanli, at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Harth. The location is quiet, the environment is beautiful, and the teaching time has been increased. Dormitories have also been added, still based on the school motto of "truth, labor, suffering, persuasion, solemnity, simplicity, and cleanliness," with the aim of cultivating female secondary education youths and transporting the necessary knowledge and skills. It is also planned to enrich the equipment and actively seek the development of the future. This year's recruitment of senior and junior high school transfer students will be held three times on January 15, 22, and 29. Registration has begun from today. Application forms will be sent upon request by mail.</p>

<p>The US Boys School Sports Department, in order to connect the friendship of various middle schools in Shanghai and improve the level of basketball, initiated an invitation basketball tournament in 1937. Twelve teams participated, including St. John's, Fudan, Xiqing, Sukoer, Guoguang, and Nanyang Model. The champion was Guoguang Middle School. In 1938, it was suspended due to the war. This year, there are already seven participating teams (the quota is limited to ten teams). Each team is a strong team in Shanghai. The opening will be held around the 20th of this month. At that time, there will be a grand event of heroes competing. The US Boys School has one of the largest basketball halls in Shanghai and welcomes visitors from all walks of life. Tickets are 20 cents. If you have any questions, please contact Mr. Bao Rang or Mr. Li Mingyang of the Sports Department of the US Boys School on Route Petain (phone 70199). Participating teams must be middle school teams that have not joined the official senior league this season. For example, if a middle school has joined the senior league with one team, the school can form another team with completely different players to participate in this league. The league authorities do not want any senior league players to participate in the competition. Independent teams representing a certain group, rather than a middle school, can participate in this league with a representative team of the same level as the middle school. The registration fee for each team is 10 yuan, which must be paid at the same time as the registration form, and a property guarantee deposit of 5 yuan must be paid. This fee will be returned when the league is over, but all order must be completed. The competition rules adopt the American rules approved by the YMCA and amateur sports organizations.</p>

<p>(Cologne, 9th - Huitong News Agency) The European Davis Cup Committee held a meeting here yesterday, chaired by President Girod, and, together with the International Lawn Tennis Association, put forward important recommendations regarding the European Zone competition system. The first recommendation is that the competition should adopt a four-week system instead of a five-week system. It was also decided that strong teams should be placed in seeded positions to avoid meeting in the first week. Furthermore, teams eliminated in the first week of the previous competition will not be allowed to participate in the following year's competition. This way, the five-week system can be changed to a four-week system.</p>

<p>The Western League First Division football match between West Fords and RACS was held last weekend at 3:00 PM at the Racecourse. The RACS team's strength was greatly diminished due to the absence of Captain Simmons and renowned left-winger Attwell. Just five minutes into the game, RACS opened the scoring, but Fraser immediately responded with consecutive goals, putting West Fords ahead 2-1. In the final ten minutes of the first half, Thompson scored a corner kick, putting West Fords ahead 3-1 at halftime. After changing ends, West Fords' momentum increased, and they ultimately won the match 7-2. Fraser scored five goals alone, which is commendable.</p>

<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>A newspaper is the voice of the people, the compass of society, bearing the responsibility of guiding the public. When a newspaper includes a medical and pharmaceutical supplement, its responsibility becomes even greater. Medical and pharmaceutical knowledge is related to human life; when used well, it is a tool for saving lives, but when used poorly, it becomes a weapon for killing. Those who run medical and pharmaceutical publications should be especially cautious. This newspaper has long had a medical and pharmaceutical weekly supplement, and the Medical Association also publishes "New Medicine and Society." Both publications have adhered to this principle, being cautious in their words and meticulous in their work. They have been published for many years and are well-regarded by readers. After August 13th, both publications ceased to exist. Now, ghosts and demons are emerging into the light of day. Colleagues in the Medical Association and the newspaper management cannot bear to stand idly by. We wish to continue the spirit of the past and seek cooperation in the future. This is why this publication has been created. I hope my colleagues will join me in this endeavor.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Commentary - Charity and the Law <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Shaoheng</p>
<p>The phrases "doctors have charitable hearts," "doctors are willing to cut flesh to heal," and "doctors are benevolent guards" are all praises for doctors, and also words of encouragement. Therefore, doctors must first have a benevolent heart before they can practice their benevolent art. What is benevolence? It is charity. Hence, the Western proverb: "A doctor without benevolence is not to be trusted." This is indeed true. Today, however, some treat charitable medical work as a personal profit-making venture. Some even pretend to be doctors, using deceptive practices to confuse the public, pursuing only profit, deserving of scorn and condemnation, and dragging the medical profession through the mud. Therefore, the government has enacted laws to regulate this, and those who serve with enthusiasm are also protected. Acts such as failing to provide aid to the dying, extorting money, refusing to treat patients without reason, and causing death through negligence are all prohibited by law. Furthermore, the law restricts doctors from performing surgery unless they first obtain the consent of the patient or their family, completing all necessary procedures before treatment. Otherwise, it is illegal and subject to punishment. Preventing problems at an early stage is not unreasonable in principle, but in practice, there are significant discrepancies. For example, if a patient needs emergency care, waiting for all the procedures to be completed before treatment could mean missing the critical window for recovery. In such cases, if the doctor adheres strictly to the law, they can only stand aside and watch the patient die, failing in their mission of charity. How can they bear this in their hearts? But if they act, they risk breaking the law and facing accusations of unintended consequences, which would be unfair. What should they do? Obstetricians face this dilemma even more often. Obstacles during childbirth often arise suddenly, without any prior warning to the mother or the doctor. Dealing with these obstacles often requires immediate action. How can there be time to seek the family's consent in such urgent situations? I recall a news story from Hangzhou that was widely reported in Shanghai newspapers a few years ago. A woman went to a hospital, and because of an emergency during childbirth and her imminent danger, the hospital's doctors performed an emergency operation without completing the necessary procedures. After complications arose and she passed away, her husband falsely accused the hospital's doctors. The court found the doctors guilty of failing to follow procedures and fined them. Doctors throughout Hangzhou were outraged and jointly issued a strongly worded statement. However, medical associations in other areas did not offer any sympathetic response. I have always felt strongly about this and have never been able to forget it. If this is not addressed, it will create significant difficulties in our work. Let me give two recent examples from my own experience. One day last year, a man and a woman came to the hospital because the woman was in labor. The man signed the admission form, paid the hospital fees, and left. Unexpectedly, the woman experienced severe pain at night, and at midnight, complications arose that required surgery. The hospital staff tried to find the man using the address on the admission form, but he was not there. The situation became increasingly critical. I had no choice but to find an Annamite policeman on the street, explain the situation, and ask him to be a witness. Another time, this past December, a woman came to the hospital late at night, knocking urgently on the door. She was in a terrible state, sobbing and unable to speak, with severe abdominal pain and unable to stand upright. I immediately had the staff carry her to the delivery room. When her pants were removed, the baby's head was already visible. In such a situation, who would have time to complete the legal procedures? To refuse her treatment would be a matter of life and death, not only impossible for humanitarian reasons, but also unacceptable to my conscience. Fortunately, both cases turned out well, but if anything had gone wrong, I would have suffered the same fate as the doctor in Hangzhou. It is difficult to balance law and charity perfectly. If this continues, how can we protect ourselves? Obstetricians, in particular, face these sudden complications more often than other doctors. To protect our work, we must collectively call for a satisfactory resolution. Now, as the Shanghai Medical Association launches "New Medicine and New Drugs," I dare to express my humble opinions in the hope of encouraging discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Popular Medical Talks - Prevention of Winter and Spring Diseases <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>What are seasonal diseases? They are infectious diseases. The most common infectious diseases in summer and autumn are cholera and dysentery, while the most common infectious diseases in winter and spring are influenza, followed by scarlet fever, diphtheria, smallpox, and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. Cholera and dysentery affect the stomach and intestines, so if one is careful about what they eat, they are unlikely to contract these diseases. However, winter and spring infectious diseases are all transmitted through the air, making them very difficult to prevent.</p>
<p>How can air transmit diseases? Disease-causing substances float in the air and enter the body through the mouth, eyes, and nose. For example, the sputum and saliva droplets expelled when a person with influenza coughs or sneezes all contain infectious substances. If people around the patient inhale this air containing infectious substances, they will be infected.</p>
<p>The secretions in the mouth and nasal cavity of a person with diphtheria also contain infectious substances. Coughing and sneezing pose the same risk as with influenza. Furthermore, diphtheria bacteria are more resistant to drying. When attached to pillows, bedding, clothing, hats, books, and toys, they can be easily dispersed into the air as dust after drying and a slight brushing.</p>
<p>At the beginning of scarlet fever, the secretions from the patient's mouth and nose are already infectious. Therefore, coughing and sneezing can transmit the disease, just like influenza. Furthermore, the red rash on the skin is highly contagious. Therefore, after a scarlet fever patient recovers, the shedding skin is most likely to infect others. Raising a hand or waving a sleeve can release the skin flakes into the air, spreading the virus to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Other diseases, such as epidemic meningitis, smallpox, and measles, are transmitted either through droplets in the air or through dust in the air. They are all collectively referred to as airborne diseases. It is not that air can transmit disease, but rather that the air carries the infectious agent.</p>
<p>The best way to prevent airborne diseases is to isolate patients with the virus in isolation hospitals. Not only patients with the virus, but also healthy people who carry the virus should be placed in isolation for treatment. People who are in close contact with patients may not be sick themselves, but their mouth, nasal mucosa, and clothing often carry the virus, serving as a medium for transmission that people may not notice. This is why recent infectious disease prevention efforts have focused so much on these virus carriers. Furthermore, people who have recovered from the disease but have not yet cleared the virus can also transmit the virus without people realizing it.</p>
<p>However, Chinese people are not fond of going to hospitals, and during these times of economic hardship, they are reluctant to be isolated for long periods of time. Therefore, this best course of isolation cannot be strictly enforced. Moreover, most Chinese people who contract infectious diseases seek treatment from traditional doctors. Those traditional doctors who are clear-headed and conscientious can still guide patients to proper channels such as isolation and vaccination. However, those who are completely muddle-headed and have lost their conscience stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that infectious diseases are caused by germs and are unwilling to let patients go to scientific doctors. They only care about their own personal interests, not the public's welfare.</p>
<p>If the best course of action cannot be taken, then the next best thing is to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary outings. However, this requires cooperation between virus carriers and healthy people to be effective, otherwise it will be of no use. For example, people who are sick or carry the virus should absolutely avoid going out to play, joining crowds, or visiting friends and relatives, unless absolutely necessary. Even if friends and relatives come to visit, they should be told the reason and not be received. When coughing or talking, they should cover their mouths with a handkerchief, and if they have sputum, they should spit it into a covered or disinfected spittoon. Those with a sense of public morality should be careful!</p>
<p>When airborne infectious diseases are prevalent, healthy people should also stay indoors and avoid unnecessary outings in order to reduce the risk of being hit by stray bullets of infectious diseases. However, if relatives and friends who have infectious diseases or are carriers visit, it is difficult to refuse them. Furthermore, it is impossible to know in advance that visitors have had infectious diseases or have been near people with infectious diseases, so it is impossible to avoid them. Therefore, unless people who have had infectious diseases or have been near infectious diseases uphold public morality and do not spray healthy people with the machine gun bullets of infectious diseases, it will not be effective.</p>
<h3 id="e122">On Tonics <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Yumen</p>
<p>The Chinese people have a habit of indiscriminately taking tonics, especially during the coldest days of winter. They believe that not taking tonics will not only hinder longevity but also make them susceptible to colds and various diseases in the spring. This view has been around for a long time. However, the so-called tonics are nothing more than deer antler, ginseng, tiger bone, donkey-hide gelatin, and the like. Some also prescribe and make so-called "medicinal pastes." These medicines may have some effect on some people, but others find that they interfere with digestion, reduce appetite, and cause physical discomfort. Recently, I personally saw an old Mr. Wang, over seventy years old, who was still vigorous and nimble. Heeding a friend's advice, he took deer antler. After only a few days, he developed a severe stomach ailment that lingered until he passed away. Therefore, in this era of rapid scientific advancement, there are definite standards for how to nourish the body and how to remedy its deficiencies. It is necessary to carefully examine and then use food or medicine to correct and remedy them, so that one can benefit without suffering harm. The biggest problem in our country is that everyone thinks they know medicine, and it can also be said that everyone is ignorant of medicine. When they see that someone benefits from eating something or taking a certain medicine, they say that it is good for everyone and encourage others to take it arbitrarily. They do not understand the quality of the person's body, whether the food or medicine is suitable for them, or whether they need it. This kind of senseless behavior, where I have seen people harm others in the name of love, is not uncommon. It is very dangerous, truly like a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pond at midnight. Human life is not like an object; once a mistake is made, it is too late to regret. Knowledgeable people must be deeply cautious.</p>
<p>Therefore, when discussing tonics, the first thing is to know what the body needs normally; the second thing is to know how to correct the body when its chemical processes cannot function properly; the third thing is that when there is an existing disease or the body is emaciated, food alone cannot remedy the situation. It is necessary to carefully examine what the body is lacking and what kind of tonic is suitable, so that one can benefit without suffering harm. Therefore, in today's science, one either does not talk about tonics, or if one does, one must clearly distinguish the above three levels. I will now describe them separately:</p>
<p>(1) A person with a seven-foot body must rely on nutrients to replenish all the cells in the body and to provide the source of thought and action. In simple terms, the nutrients needed by humans are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. In broader terms, water and salts are also added, making a total of five. The main material that makes up the cells in the human body is protein, so it is necessary to constantly add protein to replenish its consumption. Furthermore, in human life, the substances that generate heat and energy for thought, action, etc., must be constantly replenished with carbohydrate and fat. Water and salts are important supplements to the first three, so they are also included in nutrients. Once the definition of nutrients is clear, we can know that the daily metabolism replenishes the nutrients that are consumed. The body's miraculous and incredible chemical processes constantly replenish its deficiencies, so there is no need to seek additional nourishing substances. The ancients said, "Medicinal nourishment is not as good as food nourishment," which is truly a hygienic maxim. Therefore, if our meals are suitable and our digestive power is good, then our bodies can be strong and healthy. Why would we need tonics?</p>
<p>(2) If a person's body was initially very healthy and there were no other diseases, or if they ate irregularly, or if they did not maintain a certain amount and overate, causing the stomach and intestines to be unable to handle the workload and causing problems from time to time, then the food they eat cannot be nutritious and will cause the body to become thin and the energy to become weak. At this time, it is also not advisable to use tonics immediately. One must first treat the stomach and intestines, restore their digestive power, and allow the food to enter the body and complete its replenishment. Then the thin will become fat, the pale complexion will naturally become rosy, and the tired body will be able to exert itself. At this time, if one does not know how to restore digestive power and recklessly uses our country's traditionally thick and sticky tonics, it will inevitably further reduce the stomach's digestive power and cause a state of stomach sluggishness. Therefore, using tonics indiscriminately at this time will not only fail to remedy the situation but will also cause harm.</p>
<p>(3) If the body already has diseases, such as lung weakness, blood deficiency, brain weakness, poor sleep, heart weakness, incomplete function, and palpitations; or after childbirth or illness. These various conditions each have their own relationship to disease, and it is not only that ordinary tonics will be effective. Moreover, each person's constitution is different, and the ready-made medicines in pharmacies may be suitable for A but not for B, and suitable for C but not for D. At this time, if you want to take tonics, you must pay attention to the following three conditions, which I have: What are the three conditions? (1) Easy to absorb, (2) Has a real effect, (3) Suitable for the individual's constitution. Otherwise, it is not only a waste of money</p>

<p>Respectfully, since the Shanghai community initiated the Shanghai Relief for Shanghai Refugees movement, the 17th Executive Committee has discussed the matter and believes it is extremely important to support it. The Refugees Relief Association was established on the 18th of last month and will begin soliciting donations from the 1st of this month. Our association is a free professional group, and the 18th Executive Committee has decided to notify all members to do their best to pledge donations and record them. It is hoped that</p>
<p>You, with your compassionate heart that feels the hunger and drowning of others, will generously open your purse to complete this benevolent undertaking. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>With best wishes for your health. Shanghai Medical Association. and may even harm the body's health. In short, when it comes to taking tonics, first, if the body is already in good condition, there is no need to rely on medicine, as the saying goes, "medicinal nourishment is not as good as food nourishment"; second, if the digestive function of nutrients is reduced, there is also no need for tonics, only to restore its digestive power. If one does not seek correction and recklessly takes unsuitable tonics, it will be harmful and not beneficial; third, if the body is weak and needs tonics, it must be suitable for the three conditions and meet scientific principles. Moreover, it must be subjected to a detailed examination by a doctor to select the appropriate product, so that after taking it, one can obtain real benefits and not waste money.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Symptoms - Influenza <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Shenchu</p>
<p>What is commonly known as a "severe cold" is influenza. It is an international infectious disease that can be epidemic in a small area, becoming a local epidemic, or dispersed throughout various regions, becoming a sporadic epidemic. Recently, from 1926 to 1927, it was epidemic in Canada, and from 1918 to 1922, it was epidemic in Spain. At that time, the disease was rampant, and the world was shaken, calling it the Spanish Flu. Of course, there have been epidemics in the past. Recently, it is also epidemic in Shanghai, but many people do not pay much attention to it, thinking that a cold is not a serious disease. Because they underestimate it, they often delay treatment. Therefore, I am giving a special introduction here.</p>
<p>Cause</p>
<p>The pathogen of this disease has not yet been discovered. Previously, it was called Pfeiffer's bacillus, but according to recent research, it is believed that the bacteria of this disease are too small to be discovered by existing microscopes.</p>
<p>The pathogen of this disease invades through the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. It occurs mostly in spring and winter and is mostly transmitted directly. During coughing, sneezing, talking, and kissing, the disease is transmitted by droplets from secretions, or indirectly by objects used by the patient, such as handkerchiefs. This disease affects everyone, regardless of age or gender. If there is a major epidemic, our susceptibility rate is 70% to 80%.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>After infection, the incubation period of this disease is only one day, up to two or three days. It suddenly starts with chills and shivering for one or two minutes, followed by a high fever of 38 to 40 degrees Celsius. At the same time, one feels tired and has a headache, or pain in the back, spine, waist, and limbs. This kind of pain is difficult to describe. There may also be vomiting, stomach upset, sore throat, hoarseness, and bronchitis. There may also be conjunctivitis. The fever may be high or low (intermittent fever) or persistent (sustained fever). This state lasts for three to seven days before the fever subsides. This is called bronchitis-type influenza.</p>
<p>If the disease gradually worsens, bronchitis can progress to bronchopneumonia. Or, brain symptoms may occur, such as confusion or even coma. The symptoms are very similar to true meningitis. There may also be headaches and nuchal rigidity (the symptom of the trunk rising at the same time as the head when it is lifted). If this is the case, it is generally a severe case. The outcome is often fatal. In addition, there may be neuralgia, neuritis, and mental illness.</p>
<p>Influenza can also specifically affect the stomach and intestines, with vomiting as the main symptom. In addition, there may be abdominal pain and diarrhea. Severe abdominal symptoms are very similar to dysentery or peritonitis. Jaundice may also occur. This is called gastrointestinal-type influenza. If it is not during an epidemic, this type of gastrointestinal influenza is difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>The most terrible thing about influenza is pneumonia, which usually occurs on the third or fourth day after the onset of the disease. This type of pneumonia may take the course of mucosal inflammation or asphyxia. If the pulse is fast, breathing is rapid, there is much coughing, and it is difficult to cough up phlegm, then the nose will flare and the lips will be dark. This is the most dangerous phenomenon in pneumonia, and the outcome is often fatal. Fortunately, if one escapes death, after recovery, there is still a risk of bronchiectasis, lung abscess (pus accumulation in the lungs), lung gangrene (part of the lung decays), and pleurisy. Often, empyema occurs due to pus accumulation in the pleura.</p>
<p>If one has had pulmonary tuberculosis in the past, one must pay attention, as it often triggers the old disease. In influenza pneumonia, the respiratory symptoms may not subside, or there may be a slight fever that lasts for a long time, which is often mistaken for pulmonary tuberculosis. If this is the case, it is called chronic influenza, and is often accompanied by chronic bronchitis, chronic pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, suppurative otitis media, lethargic encephalitis, neuritis, and mental disorders, or it can be a sequelae of influenza.</p>
<p>Prognosis</p>
<p>The mortality rate of influenza varies greatly, ranging from just 1% in mild cases to 10% to 20% in severe, malignant cases. Pregnant women, the elderly, people with heart disease, and people with pulmonary tuberculosis have a poor prognosis. The virulence of the pathogen during an epidemic is also a major factor.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>The most important thing in treating this disease is rest. Being able to rest can prevent the occurrence of complications and has a significant effect. It is essential to eat nutritious food that is easy to digest. In addition, use a damp cloth around the chest and neck, and use an ice pack or ice pillow on the head. At the beginning of the illness, taking antipyretics to reduce the high fever by one or two degrees is also acceptable. However, it is best to follow the doctor's instructions. If symptoms such as pneumonia, gastrointestinal type, and meningitis occur, there are appropriate treatments for each. Patients should be aware that they should still stay in bed for a few days after the fever subsides and should not take a bath.</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>Prevention of this disease is very difficult. During an epidemic, it is advisable to go out less. It is not advisable to go to places with large crowds and poor air quality, such as theaters and playgrounds. When going out, it is best to wear a mask and gargle frequently with mouthwash. Avoid being close to patients, especially the elderly and children. Injecting influenza vaccine is also quite effective.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been a surge in the number of doctors in Shanghai, most of whom have come from the interior. Among them, a large number have lost their diplomas or certificates for various reasons. Those who have already obtained a doctor's certificate from the Ministry of Health, but whose certificate or diploma from the graduating school has been lost for various reasons and have not been able to register with the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, can first prepare a letter stating the reasons and submit it to the joint committee formed by the Shanghai Medical Association and the Chinese Medical Association on Chi Bang Road in this city for review. If the investigation is true, the committee can issue a certificate of proof, and then register with the Health Department. In addition, those who have graduated from medical school but have not yet received a Ministry of Health certificate and want to register with the Health Department can also request the joint committee to issue a certificate of proof.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Bat of the New Era <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Gao</p>
<p>The bat that joined the animal herd when beasts were winning, and the bird flock when birds were winning, ultimately faces rejection and abandonment due to the reconciliation of birds and beasts. The bat's cleverness is precisely what makes it foolish as a bat.</p>
<p>People evolve with the times. The tricks of the bat of the past cannot be compared with those of the bat of today. In the past, the bat determined its flight posture based on the victory or defeat of the bird-beast struggle. In terms of flattery, it not only lacked foresight but also followed others and was always exposed. Now, bats have group organizations and a spirit of division of labor and cooperation. They are the maintenance associations, the village chiefs and town heads under the puppet county government, and the bandits who rob homes and kidnap for ransom. Each hangs its own sign and displays its own abilities. From a certain perspective, a certain type of bat is used to perfunctorily deal with something, and a certain type of bat is used to handle a certain task, dealing with everything comprehensively and handling everything practically and beneficially. In this chaotic situation during the war, the occupied areas, no, the guerrilla areas, are their nests, their world.</p>
<p>However, this kind of trick that they think is cunning still has times of exposure and failure. First, can the local survivors who are exploited and robbed not resent it? Can they not report it to the × army stationed behind the front lines? Second, after the war ends, can the local officials who have suffered pain and uphold the law and humanity not settle accounts with them? The bat's cleverness is precisely what makes it foolish as a bat.</p>
<p>The situation creates heroes, and the bat has evolved again. Landlords who live off land rent, aren't they looking forward to rent rice morning and evening? But they don't dare to go to the countryside in the guerrilla areas to collect it. Officials of the puppet county government, aren't they very much looking forward to the revenue from land taxes? Taxes come from rent, and landlords who don't get rent rice naturally can't pay taxes, and these puppet officials don't have the courage to directly collect taxes from the farmers in the countryside. There are too many gangs and complex elements in the maintenance association, so they don't dare to openly and directly collect taxes from the farmers. Everyone stretches their necks and drools, but in the end, they are just drawing cakes to satisfy their hunger. If someone is kind enough to take care of us and share some crumbs of the cake, we will be endlessly grateful. As for the farmers, the grains are piled up on the threshing ground, fearing that they will be burned by the × soldiers. After being husked into rice and hidden at home, or the rice is sold and the money is hidden, they fear that the tragedy of robbery and kidnapping will be staged. And farming and paying rent is a matter of course and unavoidable. If the landlord doesn't collect rent immediately, it will only increase endless responsibilities and anxieties. The bat sees through the psychology of many parties, so it comes up with an organization of a rent collection agency. This year's rent rice is a certain percentage, the handling fee is a certain percentage, and the landlord gets a certain percentage, which is clearly defined. The so-called handling fee includes the land tax of the puppet county government, the donations of the maintenance association, and the remuneration of the bat itself. This method can achieve a win-win result based on the principle of international reciprocity. It can collect real benefits in the present and have no future troubles. There is no better method or design than this.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the war of resistance, they are using wealth to help the enemy and serving as an accomplice to the tiger. From the perspective of the local vitality, they are maintaining the power of many parties and creating a permanent chaotic situation. Who is ultimately benefiting and happy besides themselves? What Wang Kemin and his like are using to appeal is nothing more than international reciprocity and everyone's happiness.</p>
<p>Alas! Clever new era bats. I wish you to take good care of yourselves! Reside in each county and town forever! See how long you can prolong your lives!</p>
<h3 id="e129">Remembering Agnes Smedley, Reviewing "China Fights Back" <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Fei</p>
<p>Agnes Smedley is now on the battlefield again, going to the New Fourth Army near Wuhu, serving on one hand and writing communications that expose the crimes of the enemy and praise our army's resistance on the other.</p>
<p>Before our army withdrew from Wuhan, she came south from northern Shanxi, once appealing for donations for the soldiers at the front. At that time, I saw her photo published in the newspaper. Her appearance of traveling around in the wind and dust was so simple and crude that she looked like a strong peasant woman.</p>
<p>I remember on the way to send off Mr. Lu Xun's funeral, I, Zhang Ximan, Zhang Naiqi, and others followed behind the coffin. There were four or five foreigners walking together in front, including a middle-sized, middle-aged woman whose demeanor was casual but also a bit wild. She always had a cigarette in her fingers, talking incessantly and walking nimbly and lightly. It is said that she was Agnes Smedley.</p>
<p>Since "Daughter of Earth" was translated into Chinese, we have known that Agnes Smedley is a fighter for the oppressed. In the national salvation movement before the War of Resistance Against Japan, she cooperated with Soong Ching Ling and others, directly participated in the national liberation struggle in China, and edited an English-language journal called "China Forum," making anti-Japanese cries. During the Xi'an Incident, she happened to be in the Northwest. The newspaper said that she was in charge of international propaganda. Whether this news is true or not, we have a more profound impression of her.</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance began, the Eighth Route Army went to the front line, and she also "went north with Zhaopu, hungry and cold, with wounds on her back." In the extreme busyness and exhaustion, she wrote some diary letters, which are now compiled into Chinese as "China Fights Back."</p>
<p>This is a book that records the author's experiences and observations in northern Shanxi and the life of the Eighth Route Army on the front line of the War of Resistance. Louis Fischer said in the preface: "The reason why this book is important is because it comments on the Eighth Route Army's first battle in northern Shanxi. That battle produced China's new hope and new tactics." This is a very pertinent remark.</p>
<p>The success of the Eighth Route Army lies in their political education, social work, and guerrilla tactics. Their almost magical achievements should be understood from the historical roots and daily life of these points. Regarding the former, "Red Star Over China" has already narrated it quite precisely and in detail. Perhaps Agnes Smedley's "China's Red Army Marches" also has detailed records, but I have not read it. After reading "Red Star Over China" and then reading "China Fights Back," we have a more comprehensive understanding of the development of the consistent spirit of the Eighth Route Army and their life in the anti-Japanese war. It turns out that most of the soldiers in the Eighth Route Army are country folks, some of whom were even surprised to see trains and movies for the first time, and some even regarded a thousand dollars as a large sum of money. However, as the preface says, "Although they are so ignorant, they know one thing very clearly, that is, how to unite the people to resist the Japanese invaders." Their material enjoyment is a century behind the people in the cities, but their political understanding and practical spirit are probably a century ahead of most of the people in the cities!</p>
<p>This American female reporter traveled through mountains and rivers in that remote area, sometimes even sleeping in the stables with those soldiers. Her service and visits were full of hardships, but not for material rewards, but for the pursuit of truth. She records the poverty of the Eighth Route Army in general, but it is happy, brave and determined! They are used to living a poor material life, their army and people are harmonious and equal, they have seen a bright future and are determined to fight, coupled with their flexible tactics, which has become an important factor in their repeated victories and even the final victory of the entire War of Resistance.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Snow added an appendix to "Red Star Over China," but it was a theoretical text that focused on the comparison of the combat power of China and Japan. From the point of vividly recording the activities of the Eighth Route Army on the anti-Japanese front, then this book "China Fights Back" may be read as a sequel to "Red Star Over China."</p>
<p>However, because her narration is too hasty, this book is written a bit trivial and not compact, not as systematic and structured as "Red Star Over China." The material only starts from her departure to northern Shanxi and ends before she went south; and because she did not achieve her wish to go straight to the front line, she did not describe the great scenes of battle. Furthermore, there seems to be a flaw in the fact that too much space in the book is devoted to her personal trivial matters. This was compiled by her friends. She said that she will "edit it herself once in the future; I hope she can sort it out and supplement it soon.</p>
<p>Some people say that Agnes Smedley is a true "friend of China." I think this is not very accurate. It should be said that she is a fighter on the same front as the oppressed countries and people.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Confiscation of Arms <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Song Gui</p>
<p>The winter night is long and silent. It has been a long time since six o'clock, and the sky is still only dimly lit. Therefore, the market in × town also opens particularly late. When the newly rising sun shines on the Guankou (the gate for entering the town) at the end of the south market, you can see batches of villagers going to the market.</p>
<p>Recently, the opening of Guankou has been particularly delayed, not because the townspeople are greedy for peace and sleep late, nor because the villagers have farm work to do and are not in a hurry. It is because there is an additional "card-checking" ×× sentry at the Guankou. It is said that there are too many plainclothes teams mixing in and out, and the Guankou has to be opened late in order to prevent it.</p>
<p>The southern road is the most unstable, and the degree of prevention is naturally relatively strict. The villagers who go to the market often detour to the east to enter because they are afraid of trouble when passing the "card". Therefore, the ×× sentry "card-checking" at the south Guankou also appears particularly lonely. Apart from his own shadow printed on the ground in the sun, there are no other companions.</p>
<p>But this ×× sentry, who couldn't help feeling lonely, finally found a friend. He saw three figures flashing at the end of the stone road in front of him. He immediately focused his eyes to look, and then found that three people came out at the corner of the road. They didn't look strange. But he seemed very alert. He immediately realized that these three people must have bad intentions towards him, because all three of them were wearing coats, and all the plainclothes soldiers of this type of clothing had suffered a lot from them. Time did not allow him to fully consider and investigate. The three people were already standing in front of him.</p>
<p>"Good... citizen's certificate?"</p>
<p>This ×× sentry used his strong tongue to utter this heavy sound. He still arrogantly made various gestures of wanting to search.</p>
<p>"Search!"</p>
<p>These three people without "good citizen's certificates" replied to his threat in a straightforward tone. As soon as he said that, the three coats suddenly opened together, revealing each person's lapel in the style of a hero in a Peking opera, and each person's chest was impressively hung with a row of grenades like medals!</p>
<p>This damned ×× sentry was really frightened this time. Should he resist? The few are no match for the many, and his own life will not be guaranteed first. If he doesn't resist? He doesn't know the intentions of these three people, and he is afraid of implicating the safety of his troops. But the judgment of reason, which is neither left nor right, was finally overcome by the emotional function of cherishing death. At this time, he involuntarily raised his hands and burst out in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"Good citizen's certificate... not... no need!"</p>
<p>"Search!"</p>
<p>"I... I dare not..."</p>
<p>"Hand over your gun!"</p>
<p>This ×× sentry, who was as dumb as a wooden chicken, woke up. He didn't take down the gun on his back. With a terrified look, he used his hand that he put down from his head, took the gun, and respectfully offered it out.</p>
<p>At this time, they took off their coats and quickly searched the ×× sentry's body and the inside and outside of the Guankou gate. Of course, this time they were "not in vain." Look, aren't two of them carrying a small cannon on their shoulders? And the one in his hand is not empty either. Isn't that the gun just now?</p>
<p>As for that ×× sentry, he was still standing there alone.</p>

<p>— Li Tingkang</p>
<p>Jun was carrying his lecture notes and planning to go to class. There was a class on the history of political thought at ten o'clock. He looked up at the clock in the racecourse flashing in the gray clouds. It was only five past nine. There was still plenty of time, he thought, and strolled slowly along the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Every day, he watched the professor play the monkey and listened to him tell stories of the Middle Ages. Let your hatred and joy be placed on the dead ancients, so that you forget yourself and forget others, and temporarily indulge in the appreciation of antiques. But this is a great era! His heart hummed: "Isn't this just trying to find a bowl of rice? Haven't you seen the very realistic subject matter in front of you!"</p>
<p>He remembered the idea he had decided on earlier: "Go to the interior." In this era, only action can show one's own position. All talk is in vain, unless you go to the real battle line—the interior—to do it! "What's the point of being a spectator playing the monkey? I've made up my mind!"</p>
<p>A sneer hung on the corner of his mouth, and he looked contemptuously at the pedestrians on both sides, as if to say, "With these brainless things, it would be strange if China didn't perish." Yes, he also saw the most magnificent theater building in the East at a glance, and imagined the crowd of spectators crowding before the premiere. Was he a little angry? No, he just sneered: "Pompeii hasn't been destroyed yet, so what's the big deal!"</p>
<p>"Jun, are you going to class?"</p>
<p>"Um, Ying, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>"This issue of the weekly has been published, and the content has been greatly enriched. This will greatly increase our working strength. We hope that the serious attitude of this publication can restore the declining atmosphere of this isolated island a little bit. Here, take ten copies."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"You haven't attended the meeting for several times. Are you sick? Please try to write something when you have time."</p>
<p>"No, I'm preparing to go to the interior."</p>
<p>"Working in the interior is the same. When are you leaving?"</p>
<p>"Not yet."</p>
<p>"Then please let us know after it's decided. I have something to do now. Goodbye, goodbye."</p>
<p>Jun watched his back, and sneered again. He thought: enrich the content, working strength, hey! You work, you enrich, but you give the brainless people something to pass the time! That's a waste, a waste, a hundred wastes! Waste is more sinful than luxury!</p>
<p>Moreover, moreover, serious, meeting, and then you go to the dance floor to hug the dancing girls. It's better to teach yourself than to teach others. There is no work here, no everything...</p>
<p>He didn't even look at the publication and gave all of them to a roadside newspaper stand. …</p>
<p>Two months later, he was still strolling leisurely on the road, a sneer hanging on the corner of his mouth.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Destruction <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yishi</p>
<p>The commander issued the order to dig roads,</p>
<p>Several thousand strong men were to be gathered that night:</p>
<p>One from each household in the villages and towns,</p>
<p>People from eighteen to forty-five years old.</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p>The sky continued to rain,</p>
<p>The ground was still muddy.</p>
<p>Patriotic elements, unafraid of hardship:</p>
<p>Most of them carried rakes or hoes,</p>
<p>A few moved saws or axes,</p>
<p>All advanced towards the enemy's lifeline.</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p>The national army leading and protecting said:</p>
<p>The roads should be dug more than ten feet deep,</p>
<p>The bridges should be destroyed completely without leaving anything behind.</p>
<p>Patriotic people, don't be afraid of the enemy, we will resist in the front line!</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p>The sound of machine guns firing continuously,</p>
<p>The people working had no time to listen;</p>
<p>The highway shone with dazzling light,</p>
<p>The people working were also indifferent.</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p>Heave-ho! Heave-ho!</p>
<p>The work did not stop all night.</p>
<p>Wide and long highway surface,</p>
<p>Many deep ditch-like depressions were added:</p>
<p>The wooden planks and wooden piles on the bridges,</p>
<p>Were all thrown into the river, nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>… … …</p>
<p>Until the cock crowed, awakening people from their dreams,</p>
<p>They completed a mission of saving the country.</p>
<p>The sun, surrounded by black air, appeared in the east,</p>
<p>As if jealous of the people working there.</p>

<h3 id="e133">After More Than a Year of Exile and Thousands of Miles of Travel, Sun Min Returns from Kunming, Recounting the Wandering of a Large Group of Film People <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Ren</p>
<p>A large group of film artists, when the Battle of Shanghai was raging, formed the "Shanghai Film People's Troupe" and left Shanghai directly for Sichuan. Now, after more than a year, many people are still living an exile-like theatrical life there. Last winter in Wuhan made people feel even more earnestly. Yesterday, I heard that the famous actors Sun Min and Gong Jianong had just returned from Kunming after traveling thousands of miles. In order to inquire about the exile of these artists, I specially ran to Mr. Sun's house to conduct a brief interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun had just unloaded his luggage, his face full of dust, wearing an old tweed suit. After shaking hands and greeting each other, he lifted his clothes and showed the tattered lining, laughing and saying, "This is called Sichuan clothes. In other words, it is a souvenir of the hardships of this trip!"</p>
<p>Exile Situation</p>
<p>Speaking of the situation of exile: He and Bai Yang, Wang Xianzhai, Gong Jianong, Wang Zhengxin and other more than forty people left Shanghai by car to Nanjing, then transferred to a boat to Chongqing. The journey took a month. They encountered many air raid dangers in Nanjing and Hankou, but fortunately everyone was safe and sound, and no one suffered any damage.</p>
<p>They arrived in Chongqing in late October of the year before last. They performed "Battle of Lugou Bridge", "Night of Shenyang", "Thirty Million Refugees", "Living in a Drunken Dream", "Traitor" and other dramas at the Guotai Theater for twenty-six days. The ticket sales totaled more than 20,000 yuan. Although the business performance was extremely satisfactory, due to the restrictions of the contract conditions, each person only received more than 100 yuan in remuneration. It turned out that this troupe was organized by Sichuan film merchant Xia with an advance payment! It was stipulated in advance that the travel expenses must be deducted from the proceeds, and after the theater split the amount in half, Xia and the troupe would each split the remaining amount in half. Therefore, everyone had the name but not the reality, and it was inevitable that they would get very little.</p>
<p>Moved to Chengdu</p>
<p>Because of such harsh treatment, they were deeply dissatisfied, and many people raised a series of negotiations with Xia after the performance in Chongqing. As a result, the method of fixed monthly salary—from 40 yuan to 150 yuan—was changed, and then they went to Chengdu.</p>
<p>The performance situation there was also very good: The first performance of "Battle of Lugou Bridge" was performed for seven days, and the theater was full day and night. Then "Thirty Million Refugees" continued to be performed under enthusiastic circumstances. Unexpectedly, on the fourth day, the local garrison commander Yan Xiaohu watched the play, and suddenly had a great misunderstanding about the scene where the masses drove away the enemy and a red sun appeared behind the curtain to show the reunion. He actually said that they had a strong suspicion of anti-propaganda. He immediately ordered the closure of the theater and limited all the actors to leave the country within three days. Everyone was living in a foreign land, almost at a loss. It was really an unexpected disaster.</p>
<p>Great Storm</p>
<p>After this storm, they repeatedly stated the reasons why the script had been examined and approved in advance, and the plot was purely for propaganda and national salvation, and then eliminated the misunderstanding and returned to calm. However, the name of the troupe had to be changed. The troupe internally expressed opinions and split into two organizations. He and Wang Xianzhai, Ma Shouhong, Wang Zhengxin, Yuan Zhu Ru, Zhou Manhua and other seven men and women separately went on stage to other theaters; the remaining Bai Yang, Wu Yin, Xie Jun and other dozens of people changed the name to "Chengdu Troupe" and continued to perform in the original place. This lasted for three months before it ended. Their seven-member troupe was held back there for more than two months due to a salary dispute with the theater. Then they returned to Chongqing and accepted the invitation of the Kunming Theater. Bai Yang, Zhao Dan, Shi Chao, Gu Eryi and others on that side joined the Central Photography Field in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Kunming Trip</p>
<p>In September of this year, their group of seven went to Kunming for two years of theatrical life, and it ended again. He and Long Jianong were eager to return to Shanghai, so they went from there to Haiphong by transfer to Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai first. Wang Xianzhai and others, in order to accept the invitation of the Guiyang Theater, had to wait two months before they could finish their work and return.</p>
<p>Finally, talking about the anti-war sentiment in the rear: the military and civilians in various places are of one mind and are extremely enthusiastic. Under such a vigorous and determined "final victory will belong to us" situation, the future is indeed absolutely optimistic, and it can be asserted that it is not far away.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Lambeth Walk Dance Competition Record: Driving to the New District to Compete for the Championship <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>Recently, a film called "Me and my Girl"</p>
<p>The film has not yet been released in Shanghai, but the new dance step "Lambeth Walk" has swept the entire dance market, and Daxin has held a "Lambeth Walk" dance competition for several consecutive days.</p>
<p>Naturally, a simple new style is easily loved by people. In the dance market, when "The Lambeth Walk" music starts, the men and women in the dance floor have to tear open their smiling lips and shout "Hey!" "Hey!"</p>
<p>The crowd was just as expected. Under the stimulation of cigarettes, alcohol, and sensuality, the pale purple light played the most intense surreal music. The dance floor gradually became narrower due to the addition of seats for the dancers. However, that was only at six or seven o'clock.</p>
<p>Jin Yong stood in front of the band conductor Ai Pi Santo and reported the numbers of the dancers participating in this dance competition, ninety-one, ninety-three, ninety-four... one hundred and two. But three were absent and forfeited. Wearing the number cloth on his arm, and hugging his chosen dance partner, there were dancing girls, and also female guests, some in suits and leather shoes, and some in gowns and cloth shoes. Only six or seven pairs were competing, but the patterns were not simple.</p>
<p>The order was a bit chaotic, and there were playful cheers and applause from all around. More inevitably, the audience around the dance floor formed a square formation.</p>
<p>The music stopped, and the judges said: "One more time." Sure enough, the "ninety-one" and "ninety-seven" dancers showed some skills more generously. The joyful, relaxed, romantic, and funny "Lambeth Walk" dance steps aroused a burst of enthusiasm. In addition to them, there were also two pairs who received awards. In fact, the prizes were just a bunch of toys. Perhaps for the sake of entertaining this interest, it was not too dull?</p>

<p>— Silver Flute</p>
<p>The Golden City for the New Year's Lunar holiday, and the New Light theaters, have already scheduled their films. Golden City will screen Guohua's second production, the period drama "Meng Jiang Nu," and New Light will screen Yihua's historical film "The Hegemon King of Chu," directed by Wang Jue Long. Huaxin Company's palace drama "Wu Zetian" is planned for screening at the Nanjing Grand Theatre or the Great Shanghai Theatre, currently still under negotiation.</p>
<p>Yue Feng directed, and Yuan Meiyun starred in "A Young Lady," completed a long time ago, originally prepared for public screening at the Golden City Grand Theatre. Now, because Golden City is crowded with films, it has agreed to transfer it to the New Light Grand Theatre, to be screened after "Pearl Shirt."</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun has a cousin named Wang Huichan, the daughter of the famous Qin master Wang Baishui. Not long ago, she performed at the Cathay, having a good foundation in old operas. At the same time, she is also a movie fan. Some time ago, she once applied to Yihua Company, attempting to play the female lead in "The Hegemon King of Chu," but did not succeed. Now, with Yuan Meiyun's recommendation, she will join Xinhua, and the contract is scheduled to be signed within days. Ms. Wang's appearance and figure are very suitable for the conditions of a film actress, and there is no doubt that she will shine in the future.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaozhong's idealistic comedy "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later" will be publicly screened at the Golden City Grand Theatre after "The Romantic Ghost." This film stars the old partners Han Langan and Liu Jiqun, with many unexpected new gimmicks such as cars with wings and machine scoops.</p>
<p>Chen Chali's first detective film after returning to the country, "Pearl Shirt," will be screened in Hong Kong. The copy was entrusted to Gu Wuwai to take there. Gu is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong today (the 10th) on the Borden liner.</p>

<p>— Longevity Tune</p>
<p>The famous amateur performer, Mr. Bao Xiaodie, recently established the Da Fa New Year Cake Company on Tongfu Road with Mr. Yuan Senzhai, Wang Qijun, and Mao Jiahua. After the formal opening, in order to expand publicity, they also made a large-scale broadcast at the Great China Radio Station on the evening of the 6th, inviting famous performers and actors to participate and assist. When we arrived at the radio station, it was already 9 o'clock. The room was small and crowded, making it difficult to stand. Xiaodie was also busy answering phone calls to finalize orders for New Year cakes and handwriting order forms for customers. Miss Jin Suwen had just finished broadcasting a section of the slow tempo of "Wu Jia Po" and slowly came out of the broadcasting room. I saw that her face was covered with rouge and powder, and her eyebrows were thick and reaching into her temples, as she had just come here from the backstage of the Carlton. After singing, she urgently needed to rush to the next venue. Fearing being seen, she wore a copper basin hat and wrapped herself in men's clothing outside her cheongsam. Her appearance was extremely laughable. After dressing up, she hurriedly ordered a car to be sent back, which attracted attention for a while. Afterwards, Miss Wang Yaoqin sang the slow tempo of "Fen River Bay," and her voice had completely recovered its original state. Jiang Bogong sang "Fish Hiding Sword," and the clown Yi sang a "xusheng" role, which was also quite flavorful. Later, Jiang Yiqiu and Liang Cishan sang "Chasing Han Xin," Miss Wang Huigu sang "Hanyang Yuan," and the actor Liu Wenkui sang "Nanyang Guan." The most noteworthy was the large group of famous amateur performers singing Peking opera, mostly from the Mei School, carrying forward the tradition for future generations. Unfortunately, I have a bad memory and cannot list them in order. There was Miss Ji Lingzi singing a section of "Three Copies of The Legend of Taizhen," a "sipingdiao" melody, Zhang Xiaowen singing a section of "Life and Death Regret," a "erliu" melody, with Ni Jun Qiuping and Wang Jun Ruoqi playing the accompaniment. Zhou Dongshan sang a section of "Killing the Fisherman," with Zhou Dongming and Li Shishan playing the accompaniment. The gathering of Mei School "huqin" players can also be said to be a grand event of the time. Later, I heard that Miss Jin Suqin and the famous amateur performer Zhao Peixin and others had broadcasted their performances, but it was already late, and I left without hearing them to the end.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Hegemon King of Chu Falls from His Horse and Gets Injured. Jin Suqin is Determined to Film. <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— A Well-Known Person</p>
<p>Yihua's epic historical war film "The Hegemon King of Chu" has been working extremely hard in recent days. The other day, filming the scene in Lishan where the Hegemon King was surrounded was extremely grand. For a time, the Jin Situ Temple was filled with the sounds of killing, and the scene was strange and incomparable. The "Hegemon King" Wang Yuanlong was thrown from his horse twice that day, wearing heavy armor, and suffered slight injuries. However, Wang did not find it bitter, which shows a glimpse of his efforts.</p>
<p>Also, the female lead, Yu Ji Jin Suqin, because the company's filming date is increasingly approaching, requested Huangjin authorities for permission to conclude her performance in ten days, so that she can concentrate her efforts on "The Hegemon King of Chu." Jin's acting skills are famous both in the North and South. This time, her appearance on the silver screen will surely add to her brilliance.</p>
<p>This publication yesterday carried "Yihua Gives Up Jin Suqin." The Yihua Company authorities stated that this was inaccurate and put forward three points: (2) Because Jin Suqin's appearance on stage at Huangjin would not last long, Yihua postponed Yu Ji's scenes for the time being. Therefore, Jin had only filmed one palace set at Yihua. The so-called "inevitably often failing to arrive on time" is quite inaccurate. (3) Since Jin had only filmed a few opening shots at Yihua, her so-called "always happy to be autonomous," etc., is again an intentional slander. The term "always happy" suggests that it seemed as if a film was about to be completed, but who knew that nine-tenths of the film was waiting for Jin to finish her performance at Huangjin before filming could begin. (4) Given the above two points, Xin Shijun's saying that "therefore, they sought Jin's consent and immediately stopped filming" is self-defeating.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Secret History of the Palace and Opera World in the Old Capital (70) The Landlord of Luoma Lake is Named Ma <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>His shock almost turned him into a rigid corpse like the ones in Jizhou City. At that time, gusts of cold wind pierced to the bone, and the howling sounded like a lion's roar. Moreover, the palace walls were tall and large, and even if he shouted until his throat was hoarse, the people inside would not easily hear him. Fortunately, he had practiced some martial arts, so he immediately picked up a stone and went around to the northwest corner of the guard pavilion, forcefully aiming and throwing it upwards. Only then did he alarm the palace guards. After a few words of questioning and answering, they learned that the Fourth Prince was locked outside the palace gate. Just at this moment, the military officer surnamed Ma also arrived for inspection. Looking down in the snow light, he saw that it was indeed the Fourth Prince (In the Qing Dynasty, since Kangxi deposed the Crown Prince twice, he ordered that no heir should ever be formally designated. The succeeding monarch's name was secretly written in advance and stored, mostly hidden in the "Justice and Brightness" plaque in the Yuanmingyuan. Only at the time of death was the decree revealed. Therefore, most of what is said in the records calling him the Fourth Crown Prince is in fact due to a lack of knowledge of Qing history). Standing in the snow, calling at the gate, Ma thought about the importance of the duty he was undertaking. Moreover, once the palace gate was locked, it was never allowed to be opened at will. If he let the Fourth Prince into the palace out of sentiment, it would be fine if nothing unexpected happened. But if something went wrong in the palace within the next day or two, and the treasures of the inner palace were lost, he would be the first to bear the blame. Moreover, the Fourth Prince's actions were very suspicious, and he had heard that the people he associated with were all from the "green forests" (bandits). After considering it for a while, he decided that it was best not to open the gate. That night almost froze the Fourth Prince to death. Although the Fourth Prince resented him, he could do nothing about it. Later, the Grand Eunuch knew about this matter and reported it to Kangxi. The Emperor greatly praised him for it, and therefore designated land as a reward, granting him all the wasteland near the shores of Luoma Lake. The Ma family's land did not pay taxes and had no fixed boundaries. Later, they actually came to occupy two thousand "qing" of land (20,000 "mu"), becoming the first major landlords of Xuzhou. According to local elders, the chieftain of Luoma Lake, Li Pei, was the Ma family's head steward. Because the master held an official position in the capital, local officials did not dare to provoke him. Li Pei also learned the airs of the "royal grain stewards," committing adultery, plunder, and all kinds of evil deeds. The military officer Ma, who founded the family, was himself extremely law-abiding, but his descendants were very different from him.</p>

<p>— Poetry Tasting Studio</p>
<p>Nantong was at the height of Zhang Jian's (Sengong's) career after 1916. Famous people from all directions came to visit, and Sengong often had elegant gatherings amidst his busy schedule, creating them for local people. At that time, Wang Xinpu, the magistrate of Haining, retired to the countryside, but came to Nantong for pleasure during the good days of spring and autumn, occasionally performing Kunqu opera. Although he was nearly seventy years old, he showed no signs of aging when he stepped onto the stage. The elegance of the predecessors was admirable. Yuan Hanyun also came to Nantong several times, happily performing. The people of Tong were shocked by his name, and the listeners were numerous. His performance style was excellent, both elegant and refined, surpassing others. To this day, the people of Tong still enjoy talking about it. When Sun Xinyuan came to Tong as the warlord, Xu Shuzheng accompanied him. One night, Sengong held a private banquet for Sun and Xu at the Haonan villa. The guests were all famous people and scholars. In the heat of the wine, Shuzheng sang a song, "The Great River Flows East," overflowing with heroism, captivating everyone present. Xiaotu's special car went north but encountered an accident, becoming a final performance. There were still many famous people living in Tongcheng at that time. Therefore, during festivals and under the clear wind and bright moon, Sengong often took a small boat with three or five close friends, drifting in the middle of the river, drinking wine, composing poems, and singing loudly, all lamenting being like immortals. How long ago was it that the man and his music suddenly disappeared, and the elegant legacy remains forever in people's hearts. Recalling the past, how can one not be saddened!</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse Creates Havoc in the Circus - The creator of the colorful cartoon "Snow White," which caused a sensation around the world, Walt Disney, recently published a book, "Mickey Mouse Creates Havoc in the Circus." The entire book is full of wonderful and humorous images. Five million copies have already been sold in the United States. The publication department of Cathay Company, No. 8 Wenzhou Road in this city, has translated the explanation into Chinese and selected it as the first collection of comic books. It has already been published at two "jiao" per book. To give preferential treatment to readers, anyone who clips this publication's news will only be charged one "jiao" and six "fen." It is especially wonderful to give it as a New Year's gift for siblings by parents and older brothers.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Yarn and Cotton - Buying Craze Rages - Yarn Prices Rise in a Straight Line - Double Horse and Globe brands both jump by ten yuan - Japanese Yarn Also Follows Suit with an Increase of Four to Five Yuan <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The price surge in the yarn market is intensifying. Prices are soaring in a straight line, mainly due to recent active real demand and the relatively low inventory of factories. In addition, the markets in Hunan and Jiangxi are showing signs of recovery, and commercial prosperity is increasing. This news was reported in this newspaper earlier. Now, merchants from the South China, Chaoshan, Fujian, Hong Kong, and Yunnan regions are continuing to purchase tirelessly, and demand is increasingly picking up. This has shaken people's hearts, and the buying craze is raging. Another theory is that the route from Kunming to Chongqing is becoming increasingly smooth, and transportation is convenient. Therefore, the demand from the rear is indeed strong, but it is still difficult to remit funds back to Shanghai. However, with this news spreading in the market, spot traders are becoming more enthusiastic, and everyone is rushing in. 20-count "Special Golden City" yarn has already surged to a price of 400 yuan. Judging from the actual situation, this can be temporarily confirmed. However, the atmosphere in the market is lively and boiling. The general opinion is that we need to watch the price of 420 yuan. With the price surge being too rapid, the subsequent reaction cannot be ignored. Yesterday's market situation: At the opening in the morning, because all parties had real demand, buyers crowded in, and the opening price jumped by 11 yuan. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 385 yuan. Then, with Southern and Eastern Zhejiang regions purchasing one after another, the market price rose higher and higher. Moreover, a certain yarn merchant was still scouring the market for spot goods, and the market conditions were very tight. The closing price of 20-count "Double Horse" was 394 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. The morning transaction statistics totaled 2,015 bales. The market conditions: 20-count "Double Horse" rose 20 yuan, "Special Golden City" rose 18 yuan, "Heavenly Maiden" rose 20 yuan, "Double Globe" rose 20 yuan, 10-count coarse yarn rose 15 yuan, and 16-count yarn rose 13 yuan. The Yong'an factory opened 50 bales at a price of 400 yuan. Today, the exports will include 145 cotton yarn pieces to Wenzhou, 515 pieces to Shantou, 275 pieces to Hong Kong, 125 pieces to Haimen, 340 pieces to Beihai, and 955 pieces to Haiphong. The amounts purchased by the various merchants are listed on the left.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market conditions: Because Chinese yarn has been soaring for days, people's hearts have been stirred up, and prices have also risen by 4 to 5 yuan. However, demand has not been very enthusiastic. The spot price for 20-count "Water Moon" is 312 yuan, and the price for this month is 309 to 310 yuan. The spot price for 20-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn is 309 yuan, and the price for this month is 305.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e142">With Yarn Sales Thriving, Factories Are Urgently Replenishing Raw Cotton - Fire Machine Has Already Exceeded the 60 Yuan Mark - Sales of Fine Velvet Cotton Are Also Gradually Picking Up - Foreign Cotton Purchases by Chinese Factories Have Increased Significantly <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The raw cotton business is becoming increasingly developed, and market prices continue to rise high. Prices for both coarse and fine cotton have increased by more than one yuan, and the demand from the Hua Ying factory is also very active. Since the beginning of the red market, the sales of cotton cloth and cotton yarn have been thriving, and the selling prices have soared. Therefore, factories naturally have to replenish their raw materials. As for the Tianjin fine velvet cotton, which had been sluggish and suppressed by foreign cotton, the raw material for 32-count is also showing signs of recovery. Yesterday, the Shenxin factory alone purchased more than 500 pieces. However, with the exception of the Donghua factory, which purchased 500 bales of Taicang cotton, the Japanese factories showed no interest at all. This is because the Indian cotton has fallen another two "ropi," the converted price is also cheap, and the Japanese factories have purchased huge amounts due to preferential terms. Therefore, they still have no intention of actively purchasing Chinese cotton in recent times. The rising trend can still be suppressed to some extent. However, "white package" cotton still has the upper hand. Because the sources in the interior are not smooth, and the demand from all sides is urgent, the British factory Jardine Matheson purchased a huge amount of 1,500 bales of Beishi cotton. "Fire Machine" cotton has already exceeded the 60 yuan mark, reaching a new high since last year. The sources from the Subei region are gradually increasing. 3,559 bales of Tong cotton, both coarse and fine velvet, arrived in two days. Changyinsha cotton accounted for 691 bales, Niantuo Port arrived with 640 pieces, Beisha arrived with 570 pieces, and the Yangtze River arrived with 410 pieces. The current cotton sales prices and the amounts of transactions are listed below, according to He Peiben.</p>

<p>— He Peiben</p>
<p>As the weather turns cold, stoves and coal are on the market. The Shanghai people, who are raised delicately, cannot tolerate the heat or the cold. After the autumn horse races, everyone is rushing to install stove pipes in their mansions to prepare for heating. Some, more particular, like apartments, mansions, hotels, and dormitories, have installed natural "water ting" heaters and electric heaters, which are magnificent and exceptionally clean. Therefore, despite the rain and snow falling outside and the biting cold wind, it feels warm and comfortable inside, as if it were the third month of spring. The gap between the rich and the poor is like heaven and hell. However, the more superior human enjoyment is, the greater the consumption of materials. The consumption of hot water "ting" coal stoves, which are transformed from minerals into nothing, amounts to more than 100,000 tons per year. This includes four or five types of bituminous coal, anthracite coal, lump coal, and coal dust. Sales of coal dust are relatively large, with a ratio of six to four compared to lump coal, because various industrial factories, motor steam furnaces, and "water ting" stoves, as well as raw materials for coal balls, all require the use of dust, and its price is also lower, differing from lump coal by six to seven yuan per ton.</p>
<p>Two years ago, when the 1813 war broke out, domestic coal mines fell into the war zone, transportation was blocked, and sources disappeared, leading to the depletion of stocks in this city. Coal prices soared, and we had no choice but to "drink poison to quench thirst," purchasing foreign coal. As a result, the cost was difficult to reduce due to foreign exchange contraction and high freight rates. Anthracite coal rose by 40-50% compared to before the war, and bituminous coal even exceeded double that amount. Previously, Kai Ping "smothered coal" dust, which cost 12-13 yuan per ton, now costs 36-37 yuan, which is truly unbelievable and unexpected. Especially strange is that bituminous coal dust is actually more expensive than anthracite coal dust (No. 1 Hongji anthracite coal dust only sells for 29 yuan per ton), which can truly be said to be "extraordinary circumstances for extraordinary prices."</p>
<p>Because of this abnormal situation, some people thought they had an opportunity to take advantage of it and make a fortune from foreign goods. They mixed and matched No. 2 Hongji anthracite coal dust, which costs 20 yuan per ton, with recycled dust from coal ball factories, pretending it was Indian bituminous coal dust and selling it to various factories for 28 yuan per ton. In any case, outsiders "judge by ear instead of eye," only listen to the price, and have difficulty distinguishing good from bad, often being "deceived by a fish eye mixed with pearls" and agreeing to a deal of 50 or 100 tons. By the time they find out when using it, the "money has already fallen into their hands," and it is difficult to recover. (It is heard that more than ten companies in the same industry have been deceived). There are also some factories that have not yet traded with him, but when they hear about this price, they are furious and go to negotiate with the old coal companies they trade with, thinking that they are charging too much and making too much profit, demanding price reductions. In reality, whether they are "foreigners" or "Chinese," doing business is about profiting from capital. "Being beaten and scolded, one doesn't lose capital." How can there be a merchant in the world willing to lose money to please buyers? In fact, it is those "hanging a sheep's head, selling dog meat" slippery merchants who are cheating and disrupting the market. Customers are unaware and thus misunderstand. Therefore, I am using this small space in this publication to express this, hoping that the coal industry authorities will investigate and prove it, and that factory users will be careful not to believe it lightly. Otherwise, "greed for cheapness buys an old ox, and you fall twice a year," wanting to be cheap but instead suffering losses.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Prices: The New York cotton market is quiet. All industries are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the cotton market, expecting the development of legislation in Washington regarding cotton loans and the sale of loaned cotton. Sales reports of cloth are still good. The market fell due to selling pressure at the opening, but recovered slightly due to purchases by the same industry. As a result, it still rose six or seven "bangyin." Indian cotton fell three "ropi," with a forecast increase of one "ropi" and seventy-five "pieces." "Liangche" is still down more than one "ropi." The Egyptian market is closed. Yesterday's exchange rate did not fluctuate much. Converting to legal currency, American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose five "jiao" per "dan," and Indian cotton fell more than two "jiao."</p>
<p>Foreign cotton transactions in this city have been loose for days due to brisk sales of yarn and cloth. Yesterday, cotton yarn surged more than 20 yuan again. The native cotton "Fire Machine" Yao flower also created new high prices of 67 and 65. The prices of Indian cotton have recently fallen by more than one yuan. Because Chinese factories are in great need of cotton, they have forgotten the harsh conditions of foreign merchants and are willing to pay a deposit of 20% to order large amounts of foreign cotton. Yesterday, the transaction of Indian cotton was over 10,000 bales, with Chinese factories accounting for 3,000 bales. According to the current cotton situation, the number of foreign cotton imports may increase daily. Previously, the price of fine velvet cotton was high and occupied by Brazilian cotton, but now Indian cotton will also replace short velvet cotton. Yesterday's transaction volume and spot market prices are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Securities - Unified A Seen Again at New High Price - Rumor of Interest Suspension Proven to be Fabrication - Floating Capital Turns to Public Bonds <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The off-market securities market yesterday initially showed a trend of firm and slowly rising prices, and then showed a new atmosphere of a sharp rise. Last week's rumors of problems with public bond interest have been confirmed by the financial community to be completely unfounded. People's hearts have been calmed. The new Japanese cabinet's policy towards China is based on the fixed strategy of the old cabinet. And our highest authorities are tolerant of Wang Jingwei's absurd remarks, hoping that he will reform and start anew. Combining observations of various situations, it is not difficult to get a rough idea of the recent trends. Recently, with no opportunities to profit from yarn, flowers, socks, gold, and foreign exchange arbitrage, and with an abundance of floating capital, public bond trading has become more lively and is gradually becoming more prosperous. It is a pity that the exchange has not been able to open, so the market cannot be fully developed. Yesterday, in the morning, only retail investors had more demand. Later, Runli Company successively purchased, and the market price gradually climbed. Before noon, the price rose by one to four "jiao." In the afternoon, the atmosphere was even stronger, and various merchants enthusiastically absorbed them. Among them, a large household entrusted Dafeng Company to cover its short positions, with a very large amount. The price surge suddenly rose sharply, and the chips on the market suddenly became depleted. The supply and demand were absolutely disparate, and the price rose by about one yuan again. All types closed at the highest price of the day. Type A saw a new high price of 63 yuan and 35 fen, exceeding the high price of the 24th of last month by 95 fen. The reason for Type A is that the seventh lottery draw is approaching, and the number of lottery branches has suddenly increased to 28, making it easier to win, so people are flocking to it. Although other types have not yet seen new high prices, they are not far away. The prospects for the market are indeed optimistic. As a result, the price rose by 1 to 1.45 yuan, and the number of transactions was over 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Finance - People's Hearts Unstable, Cash Gold Prices Fluctuate Rapidly - Resulting in a Continued Drop of Six Yuan <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-market conditions for cash gold were still fluctuating rapidly, purely based on foreign exchange contraction and people's hearts. Initially, due to the sharp fall in British pure gold again, it gradually fell to a low of 80 yuan. Then, the Qian Dui industry and the Dalian merchants suddenly showed buying intentions. At the same time, the domestic foreign exchange market weakened, causing a temporary rise. Later, because gold merchants and silver shops supplied and sold, it suddenly fell back, but there were many fluctuations in the middle, but there were no excessive ups and downs. People's hearts were unstable, and trading throughout the day was still not deserted.</p>
<p>Silver Shops and Gold Shops Sell "Sha Chi" Gold</p>
<p>From the morning, initially, because various parties saw that British pure gold had been falling sharply for days, prices went slightly downward. Therefore, buyers did not come forward. The opening price in the morning was six yuan lower than the previous trade. First, the silver shops sold 50 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 1,985 yuan. Later, the silver shops' selling intentions were still strong, so prices continued to fall. The silver shops sold 30 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 82 yuan. After that, the "rangquan" merchants, the Qian Dui industry, and the Dalian merchants suddenly came to scour the market, causing prices to turn upward. The securities merchants bought 50 "liang" from the silver shops at a price of 82 yuan, and immediately sold them back to the Dalian merchants at a price of 86 yuan. Then, the Qian Dui industry did 20 "liang" of mutual trading at a price of 85 yuan. In the meantime, gold merchants suddenly came to sell sharply, causing the price to fall back. The gold merchants sold 50 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 82.5 yuan, then sold 30 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 80 yuan, and then sold 40 "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 82 yuan. The afternoon closing price: In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market was slightly tight, causing buyers to be slightly optimistic. At the same time, sellers were reluctant to sell, so the price rose slightly. First, the silver Dui industry did 30 "liang" of mutual trading at a price of 86 yuan. Then, the Qian Dui industry bought 50 "liang" from the gold merchants at a price of 88 yuan. During that time, gold merchants' selling intentions were strong again, so the price gradually fell back. The gold merchants sold dozens of "liang" to the Qian Dui industry at a price of 84 yuan. After that, the gold merchants stopped selling, so the price rose again. The Qian Dui industry bought 50 "liang" from the silver shops at a price of 87 yuan. Finally, the Qian Dui industry bought 50 "liang" from the same industry at 1,985 yuan, which was the closing price in the evening, a drop of six yuan compared to the Saturday noon closing price. The difference throughout the day was eight yuan. The selling price of cash gold by the gold shops was 1,995 yuan, and the purchase price was 15 yuan lower. The spot gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was no trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Reduced by Another Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>The price of jewelry gold per "liang" remained unchanged initially. But upon hearing that "sha chi" gold had fallen, the price was uniformly reduced by one yuan at 10:15 in the morning. Datonghang listed 201 yuan, and Xintonghang listed 199 yuan (purchase price was uniformly 193 yuan).</p>
<p>Guan Pure Gold Plummets Following London</p>
<p>The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold ("sha chi") suddenly plummeted again to 1,214.6 yuan. The listed customs gold plummeted by one "fen" and one "li," falling to 2 yuan, 4 "jiao," and 1 "li." The Shanghai standard gold price plummeted by 5.8 yuan to 1,209.9 yuan, which was caused by London's cable on the 7th, British pure gold plummeted to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9.5 "pence" per ounce.</p>

<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold continued to fall by 8.5 "pence," and the British-American exchange rate continued to rise by 625. Although the supply of foreign exchange was strong, the settlement of accounts was very frequent, and the trend was slightly tight. Trading of "sha chi" gold was not strong, and the profitability of sales was slightly high. The market was slightly soft. Foreign currencies rose slightly with the slight tightening of the foreign exchange market. The demand for Japanese gold notes at the door was very urgent, and the price tended to be strong. The association's transactions were strong. Changtai sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Yongtai, Yingfeng sold 500 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Tongfeng, Xiangtai sold 500 dollars of American gold notes to Yongtai, Yikang sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Yongtai, Qintai sold 500 dollars of American gold notes to Yongtai, Dingyuan sold 400 dollars of American gold notes to Yongtai, Qintai sold 100 pounds of British gold notes to Yongtai, Sentai sold 50 pounds of British gold notes to Yuantai, Xiangyuan sold 400 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Tongyuan, and Chengtai sold 100 pounds of British gold notes to Litong. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by 1 "jiao," British gold notes rose by 6 "fen," American gold notes rose by 5 "li," Hong Kong notes rose by 4 "li," French franc notes rose by 1 "li," Canadian notes rose by 3 "fen," and other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Supply Exceeds Demand: Currency Market Turns from Loose to Tight, British and American Exchange Rates Continue to Rise, Unexpectedly, Japanese Banks Engage in Settlements in the Afternoon <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the currency market continued to strengthen as the British pound was supported by the authorities. The rise in exchange rates between the British and American currencies did not cease, so the situation continued to be tight for the British and perhaps for the American currency. Midway, due to the large-scale disposal by Standard Oil of New York and the insufficient supply from banks, coupled with unusually high demand, and the sluggishness of remittances from Hong Kong and other places, the situation turned from loose to soft. Eventually, the sale by the British firm Sassoon and the willingness of money changers to sell caused the market to return from tight to flat. Japanese banks suddenly became active, and the market softened again in the afternoon. Trading was quite active throughout the day.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London "large accounts" (major commercial paper transactions) decreased due to their distance, and New York spot rates remained unchanged. London spot gold fell sharply by 8.5 pence. The exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 25, and the rate against the French franc rose by 7. The rate against Shanghai remained the same. The American currency also rose by 625 against the British currency, increased by 375 against the French franc, and increased by 2.5 cents against Shanghai. The central bank's official exchange rates remained unchanged and stagnant. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 8.515625 pence for the British currency and 16.625 yuan for the American currency, which was 0.015625 pence looser for the British currency and 0.0625 yuan tighter for the American currency compared to last Saturday. After the opening, the situation eased slightly due to joint selling by Hong Kong telegrams and Sassoon. When the HSBC official rates were announced, they remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was reduced by one cent. Thereafter, the demand for settlement by Standard Oil of New York suddenly increased, the banks' willingness to sell was weak, and the demand was strong, causing the underlying trend to suddenly tighten. The British currency softened to 8.46875 pence, and the American currency to 16.53125 yuan. Subsequently, foreign telegrams suddenly started selling, and Sassoon also offered to supply. The banks' willingness to sell improved slightly, and the trend gradually turned firmer. Furthermore, money changers sold British and American gold notes and Hong Kong currency, increasing liquidity. The Hong Kong currency rose to 57.125 yuan. The market situation turned flat at noon, with the British currency at 8.5 pence and the American currency at 16.5625 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, the selling from foreign telegrams and Hong Kong was not strong, and the demand from foreign firms and various banks suddenly increased. Japanese banks also engaged in settlements, causing the supply to temporarily fall short of demand, and the situation further softened. The British currency fell to within 8.5 pence. However, the Hong Kong currency remained at 57 yuan. Subsequently, transactions became scarce, and the process gradually stabilized. The banks' selling prices at the close of the day were 8.484375 pence for the British currency and 16.53125 yuan for the American currency. As a result, the British currency was 0.015625 pence tighter compared to last Saturday, and the American currency remained unchanged. The transactions for the day are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Cash-Filled Cards: Discount Rates Plunge, Lowest Dropping to 25 Yuan <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange continued to fall. The discount rate per thousand yuan had fallen to within the 30 yuan range. The clearing house also lowered it to 30 yuan. It is said that although China is experiencing war, its finances remain sound. Foreign exchange rates are stable, and fewer people are settling foreign exchange. Furthermore, many people are issuing legal tender (fabi) to collect government bonds, resulting in an overabundance of cash. The market was stable in the early morning, but news of another reduction in the clearing house's discount rate spread, causing morale to weaken, suppliers to concentrate, and prices to plunge to a low of 25 yuan. At noon, the price recovered slightly to around 26 yuan. It was low in the afternoon, with some absorption, and suppliers were cautious due to the low price, causing it to continue to rise. It finally closed at 29 yuan, a sharp drop of 3.5 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Sugar Market: Newly Arrived Slab Sugar, High Price, No Transactions <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Five thousand seven hundred bags of Dutch sugar arrived. The sugar market trended stably yesterday. The association's standard price for No. 24 coarse granulated sugar was traded for over 800 bags. The price for goods from this warehouse was 24.5 yuan, while the price for goods from other warehouses was 24.3 yuan. Re-exported goods were priced at 16.25 yuan, spot Dutch brown sugar at 16.6 yuan, and re-exported goods at 11 yuan. Taikoo "Car White" B mark goods from the eastern warehouse were priced at 23.8 yuan, and the western warehouse at 23.8 yuan, with a volume of around 500 bags traded. The price negotiation was quiet. The Chaozhou guild opened the price for top-quality brown cotton sugar at 14.95 yuan, settling at 14.78 yuan, for refined green sugar at 12.4 yuan, settling at 11.78 yuan. The price of cotton white sugar increased because the Ningbo guild did not import any. There were no transactions. The Fujian guild continued to open the price for over a hundred bags of unrefined green sugar at 11.2 yuan, over two hundred bags of miscellaneous white sugar at 19.56 yuan, over a hundred bags of Chaozhou Beijing brown sugar at 14.6 yuan. The Guangdong guild newly arrived one hundred and twelve boxes of Beihai slab green sugar, asking for 11.5 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, there were 5,700 bags of sugar transported from the Netherlands. Yesterday, 100 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong, and another 400 bags came to Shanghai from Shantou.</p>

<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>The market situation continues to improve due to the soaring yarn prices and demand from all regions. Selling prices continue to rise. Lun Chang blue cloth, printed cloth, satin, and colored zigong continue to rise by one jiao per bolt. The opening price of Xin Feng "Dancing Butterfly" blue cloth yesterday was five jiao higher per bolt compared to last week. Blue cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, and fine twill from other factories also uniformly increased by one to four jiao per bolt. However, there were no changes in the prices of coarse cloth and coarse twill due to slightly clearer current sales and abundant inventories. However, the factories' attitudes are quite firm due to inventory costs. Current sales of blue cloth and colored twill are the largest. Changzhou and Wuxi purchased over 5,000 bolts. The Tianjin guild continued to purchase over a hundred pieces of blue cloth. The Ningbo and Shaoxing guilds purchased over two hundred pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and printed goods. The Oujiang, Jinhua, Lanxi, Jiangxi, and Hunan guilds also had strong demand, purchasing over three hundred pieces at higher prices. This is because cloth prices in the interior are much higher than in Shanghai, so even if Shanghai increases prices, there are still substantial profits. However, the amount of purchases is limited due to difficulties in remittance.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Fine cloth and fine twill were already extremely firm last week due to the sharp rise in raw cotton and smooth dyeing and sales. Yesterday, the market price jumped again. Fine cloth rose sharply by three to four jiao per bolt, and fine twill rose by one and a half to two jiao. The local industry firms were excited and ordered over 2,500 pieces of current and future goods from various firms. As for actual sales, in addition to around 2,000 pieces of various brands of grey cloth for dyeing cloth and colored twill continuing to be traded, sales to northern customers also expanded. The Tianjin guild purchased 1,500-1,600 pieces of fine cloth with "Dragon Head," "Colored Ball," "Yang Crane," "Flying Fish," and "Trumpet" brands, as well as fine twill with "Dragon Head," "Five Blessings," and "Baby" brands. The market sentiment and business are becoming increasingly prosperous. The general consensus is optimistic.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Today's exports include seventy-two pieces to Wenzhou, three hundred and ten pieces to Shantou, nine pieces to Hong Kong, seventy-two pieces to Haikou, thirty-five pieces to Beihai, and thirty-eight pieces to Haiphong.</p>

<p>American canned coral abalone has a balanced supply and demand, so retailers do not feel a shortage. The recent market price is 57 yuan per case (including permit). If sold locally, the price can be slightly reduced.</p>
<p>Yesterday's seafood arrivals in Shanghai included one hundred cases of sea cucumber and two thousand four hundred bags of raw starch, transported from the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Honeysuckle has sales outlets everywhere. For export goods, the bulk is shipped to Hong Kong and Guangdong. Sales were strong during the summer, with high-quality goods selling for 95 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Since the season has passed, demand has decreased. The current market has fallen by more than ten yuan compared to before. It is found that the most inventory is held by local wholesalers, and there is no outlet for it at the moment. Only high-quality goods are said to be in short supply.</p>

<p>Yesterday's silk market: New York was closed on Sunday. Yokohama spot price was 830 yuan, and the forward price was 829 yuan, a decrease of five yuan compared to the previous week. The local market sentiment remained bullish. The asking price for foreign-type dry cocoons directly knocked on the 300 yuan mark. However, foreign firms' purchasing interest was not strong, and their price limits were harsh. No sales were reported by the factories. According to the current situation, white silk factories would not sell at a price below 1,300 yuan. Internal transportation of white raw silk has not been interrupted. However, Shanghe's stimulus did not affect the foreign silk market. Yesterday, Samsung and others purchased 10 dan (a unit of weight) of spun silk. The market price was lower by 10-15 yuan compared to before the New Year due to excessive local inventory.</p>

<p>Black dates are now running out of supply, and the market trend is gradually tightening. It is found that the total inventory is less than 3,000 bags, which must be sold until mid-June or July of this year. It is estimated that there will inevitably be a day when the supply is insufficient, so the negotiated price is becoming more attractive. Shandong merchants have been opening sales sporadically in recent days, with prices rising by more than four yuan compared to the previous market. Retail prices are therefore also increasing.</p>

<p>Fujian shiitake mushrooms are currently in the transition between new and old crops. All guilds are presenting a sluggish purchasing trend, and merchants are eager to unload old goods in hand, resulting in further price declines. For example, medium-grade thin mushrooms are only priced at 175 to 180 yuan, a drop of about 20 yuan compared to the previous market. It is reported that Xiang is planning to start purchasing, but it is still in negotiations.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market trend continued unchanged. On the customer sales side, the sales of the Beiyang Guild were mediocre, because the goods previously purchased were still being loaded and transported, and there were few new transactions. The rumor that the customer was negotiating with the factory to purchase futures in batches has not been confirmed. However, the demand from the Nanyang Guild has increased. The goods previously batched by the Shantou and Fujian guilds have been shipped one after another, and the purchasing interest seems to be continuous. The purchase of nearly 20,000 bags of No. 2 flour such as "Green Sky Bamboo" and "Green Fisherman" is planned. In addition to the 7,000 bags of retail sales of No. 2 flour from the "Car Boat" brand in this street, the sales of the Hebei and Shandong guilds also have 7,000 to 8,000 bags. The factory price of No. 2 flour is still 4.9 yuan, and the price of the negotiated No. 2 flour is also stable. Today, 7,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Shantou.</p>

<p>The wheat supply yesterday and today was slightly higher than before, because some ships blocked in inland rivers have been released. The total number of wheeled vehicles arriving with goods is no less than 20,000 bags. Famous factories' purchasing interest is gradually improving, and eating dishes are also becoming more lenient. A total of 16,000 bags of wheat from Jiangbei, Puzhen, Chuzhou, Wuhu, etc. are planned to be purchased equally by Fuxin and Fufeng factories. The highest price has reached 6.7 yuan, an increase of several points compared to last week.</p>

<p>The soybean oil market was initially just a spot market transaction, but under abnormal development, it has now become the only speculative market for the propertied class inside and outside the industry. Yesterday, the market price for Dalian oil delivered in the second half of January differed by more than four jiao in a single turn of events, and the result was the same price as the current oil. According to the speculation of the general public, one reason is that Dalian City is bullish, and the second is that the second half of January is the beginning of the twelfth lunar month, and it is estimated that the sales market in various regions will be more active, so speculators have ordered them one after another. Therefore, the spot market is mediocre, and the market price has fallen by 5 points to 1 jiao compared to last Saturday.

<h3 id="e160">In Order to Solve General Family Disputes Today: The Efforts that Married Couples Should Make Regarding Love! <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Since the promotion of equal rights for men and women and open social interaction, many disputes have increased within families. From the perspective of social evolution, this is a natural phenomenon and nothing to be surprised about. However, too many disputes within families will affect social stability. If we open various newspapers, they are almost full of tragedies such as divorce, elopement, love killings, and love suicides! Why do men and women in the world do this? It must be due to unavoidable difficulties and historical reasons.</p>
<p>Things will inevitably go to extremes and then reverse. Enough is as good as a feast, and the shortcomings are the same. Chinese women have been imprisoned in their families for thousands of years. Now that they have been liberated, some people have been deeply poisoned by the remnants of the old ethics and are difficult to change. Although they are in this new trend, they are still ashamed to meet people. How can they talk to people about social interaction and love? Even more, they suffer from secret diseases in their body and mind due to the constraints of the old ethics and are not worthy of talking to people about social interaction and love? In addition, there are fashionable women who have turned their backs on their previous mistakes.</p>
<p>They curl their hair, heighten their heels, powder their faces, redden their lips… They enter dance halls, singing houses, tea houses, and restaurants… They talk to people about social interaction and love everywhere they go, changing partners frequently and being willing to marry anyone… If this type of woman has a husband, wouldn't family problems arise? As for men, there are also similar situations. The most common contradictory phenomenon is that they need fashionable women as wives, but they still have the old ethical concepts and want to exercise their authority as husbands in the family. It is true that in a patriarchal society, the husband's authority in the family is above everything else. The wife calls her husband "Heaven," and the husband regards his wife as a "slave." But how can this work in today's liberated and fashionable wife? Therefore, the family is prone to problems.</p>
<p>In order to solve general family disputes today, if the corrupt forces of the old ethics in marriage and family must be overthrown, then the love between husband and wife, the foundation of a new family, must be established. With this solid new foundation, a happy family can be formed. Love is also above all else. Any family disputes can be resolved with love. At the same time, the love between husband and wife is like a seed in a seedbed, which is easy to cultivate. Because it is naturally endowed with the ability to grow, we only need to pay attention to watering and fertilizing it regularly, and it will easily flourish and grow. However, the most fundamental issue about love is the physical condition of both husband and wife. As long as the man is strong and the woman is healthy, it is easy to bring them into the kingdom of love, living a sweet life as a couple, striving for each other and for a common future. How happy and glorious this is! If either the man or the woman is poisoned by the old ethics, or suffers from weakened sexual function due to early masturbation and debauchery, the man suffers from spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, kidney deficiency, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia, etc., and the woman suffers from irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, insensitivity, breast pain, and facial aging, then they must find a way to cure it. If they procrastinate and do not take it seriously, it will not only affect the love between husband and wife, leading to family disputes, but also spread the disease, weakening the whole body, and even endangering life. Therefore, it must be treated as early as possible. An effective treatment is to purchase and take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadogen" (the medicine is for both men and women, and all pharmacies sell it). After taking it, it can produce sperm, strengthen the brain, and promote blood circulation in one day and night, treating diseases and strengthening the body when there is no disease. The most amazing thing is that after women take the "Female Gonadogen," not only are the diseases cured, but it can also develop the breasts, make the face rosy, and enhance health and beauty. However, men with spermatorrhea must also take "Himito's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect is faster! These medicines have been proven by famous European and American doctors such as Kamdoring and others to be of the purest quality and the most effective and great, so they have long been popular around the world and have won praise. I have also conducted precise and long-term experiments to see if this medicine is suitable for the Chinese people's physique, and I deeply feel that it is also very suitable for the Chinese people and that it is indeed effective in treating the above-mentioned venereal diseases. According to statistics, tens of thousands of people who have come to this clinic or have taken this medicine to treat themselves through correspondence have recovered.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Common Diseases of Youth: The Problem of Nocturnal Emission During Adolescence <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>The most important juncture in one's life, where career and happiness converge, is undoubtedly the golden age of transitioning from childhood to the period of spring passion. Young people in this era, on the one hand, are like newborn calves that are not afraid of tigers, and everything seems to be the most courageous and progressive. But on the other hand, they also feel the most dangerous and terrifying! Because young people in this period often have unstable blood and weak willpower. Once tempted by the outside world, they can easily fall into the quagmire and become incurable. Now, let's put aside the big topics of academic career and only talk about health. There are many, many young people who are either stimulated by their own hormones, or driven by curiosity, or seduced by the environment, who are indecisive, regardless of the consequences, and boldly commit masturbation.</p>
<p>Masturbation is a simple and despicable bad habit, but once young people break the taboo and get involved, it is easy to become a habit. Once a habit is formed, it is like being addicted to smoking. Although they know the harm, they cannot completely eradicate it. Because they cannot completely eradicate it, the pubertal glands are first destroyed, the sperm gate is relaxed, and there are phenomena such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, dizziness, blurred vision, drowsiness, poor memory, etc. If they are left untreated, the semen will be lost in large quantities, resulting in kidney deficiency, impotence, incomplete development, testicular atrophy, etc. It is difficult to escape such symptoms. Therefore, young people's inherent health and natural function are completely lost, and his life's great career and sweet happiness are completely destroyed!</p>
<p>However, how can young people who have the above misfortune seek to remedy it? I say: The medicinal power of the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadogen" can be used to fulfill their wishes. Because "Gonadogen" is made from the essence of the gonads of strong animals, it can continuously supply new energy to us after taking it, creating a strong body and complete reproductive function. The aforementioned symptoms can be cured naturally. However, nocturnal emission is caused by excessive use of the sperm gate, and it cannot be cured by tonic. It is advisable to quit bad habits and also take the sperm consolidation medicine "Himito's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" to completely restore the control of ejaculation. However, if the patient is in this city, it is best to come to this clinic to use the "Dietmann" electrotherapy machine for electrotherapy, so that the effect will be faster.</p>

<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>What is considered beautiful? This is determined according to each person's aesthetic concepts. Therefore, there is often a situation where A thinks it is beautiful and B thinks it is not beautiful, and B thinks it is beautiful and A thinks it is not beautiful. But this is just a difference of opinion. Modern people no longer recognize women with "three-inch golden lotuses" and a swaying gait as beauties. Therefore, the concept of beauty is also shifting with the trends of the times.</p>
<p>The times' concept of beauty for women has emphasized the healthy beauty of well-developed female characteristics. This is in line with the requirements of life and the principles of physiology. The characteristics of women are nothing more than the complexion, breasts, and hips. The breasts are the main part of female beauty, because the development of the breasts must be based on the function of the ovaries. If the ovarian function is sound, the breasts will naturally be very developed, presenting a full and elastic phenomenon. At the same time, the development of the hips must also be sound, symmetrical up and down, which constitutes the unspeakable mysterious curve of the female body. If you wear a cicada-wing-like shirt, this curvaceous beauty is revealed from the slender and lively body. How captivating is this soul. In addition, because the ovarian function is sound, the metabolism must also be vigorous. Therefore, whether in the skin, muscles, or blood, it is full of new cells. Therefore, the face is naturally rosy, the skin is naturally fair… There is no need for makeup, and natural health and beauty is ten thousand times better than artificial beauty. However, in fact, most women, due to the constraints of ethics or the masturbation during the pubertal period and the debauchery after marriage, the ovarian function is destroyed, and because of the influence of secret diseases such as irregular menstruation and vaginal discharge, the ovarian function is weakened, so they present breast atrophy and facial aging, or even infertility. This type of woman is not only not liked by her husband and falls into the most tragic fate, but she herself is also surrounded by secret diseases and suffers unspeakable pain! But this phenomenon is not an incurable disease. The only solution is to take the ovarian preparation "Female Gonadogen," which can strengthen ovarian function and promote metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms can not only be eliminated invisibly, but also naturally enhance the health and beauty of the face, breasts, and hips. Then, how ignorant is the act of applying makeup to women with breast atrophy and facial aging!</p>

<p>— Zhao Jingzong, Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road</p>
<p>Editor-in-chief Dr. Zhan, New Medical Journal:</p>
<p>(Previous omitted) I am now 24 years old. When I was 17 or 18 years old, I learned about knowledge early when studying abroad, and I was addicted to masturbation. When I left school and started working at the age of 20, I gradually became aware of it, but I still relapsed from time to time. Soon after, I realized the despicability of this behavior and made a vow to quit it. However, although masturbation was stopped, spermatorrhea followed. At first, it was three or four times a month, then it increased to seven or eight times, almost every other day. Even when I saw women or used my brain a little during the day, semen would involuntarily seep out through the opening of my penis. Not only were my clothes often dirty, but I also felt dizzy, lightheaded, and had poor memory. I often suffered from insomnia and was upset. If I moved a little, I felt sore back and weak limbs, so I felt that I could no longer perform my duties, so I asked for leave to go home to recuperate. When my parents saw me in this situation, they thought that I could recover after "rushing to celebrate," so they took advantage of being at home to marry me to a woman surnamed Zhang. However, after marriage, not only could I not "rush to celebrate," but the disease became more and more serious, and kidney deficiency and impotence broke out. Therefore, since the marriage until now, it has been a year, and my wife is still a virgin. How similar must be the frustration of my wife! She often urged me to seek medical treatment immediately, but because I lived in a remote rural area, it was difficult to find a good doctor. After the "August 13th" incident last year, I came to Shanghai to take refuge. At first, I didn't know about your wonderful skills. After another half a year, my wife discovered the New Medical Journal in the newspaper. After reading it, she wrote a letter to inquire. I received your guidance and was told to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadogen" and "Himito's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" together. After taking them, I no longer leaked semen. Later, I followed your instructions and took "Gonadogen" exclusively. In less than half a year, my health was completely restored. Now, because I have a friend named Zhang who wants to come to see a doctor, I am sending this letter to introduce him and express my gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Don't Be Greedy for Cheap Things <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Lishi</p>
<p>Everyone loves cheap things, especially Chinese people, who not only love cheap things but also greedily seek them.</p>
<p>Loving cheap things is originally human nature, and there's nothing wrong with that. However, greedily seeking cheap things is a mistaken mentality caused by a lack of understanding, which is unacceptable.</p>
<p>There are genuine and fake cheap things. Those that meet subjective conditions and objective needs are genuine cheap things. Conversely, they are fake cheap things. The result of greedily seeking fake cheap things is suffering real losses.</p>
<p>Chinese people seem to be the most greedy for cheap things in commercial activities. Manufacturers, because buyers love cheap things, cut corners and seek cheapness in costs. Buyers, because of their weak economic capabilities and the temptation of cheap forms, become even more greedy for cheap things. The former does so to "quickly turn profits and make more money," while the latter does so to tighten their belts. The situation may be understandable, but in reality, both sides suffer significant losses. Countless manufacturers lose their reputations as a result. Many buyers also suffer material losses. It's truly a lose-lose situation. Moreover, this phenomenon is being exploited by economic aggressors as a path of attack.</p>
<p>In order to realize their dream of monopolizing China, they have used economic aggression policies as a vanguard for several years, shipping large quantities of low-quality goods to sell at dumped prices, thereby exploiting the Chinese people. General merchants only seek profit and are helping the wicked to do evil, desperately helping them sell. The general public only cares about petty gains, vying to buy. This mentality and behavior of greedily seeking cheap things has unexpectedly led to the tragic consequences of being massacred, burned, raped, and plundered today. Thinking of this, it is extremely painful!</p>
<p>Recently, the National Government, in view of the long-term war of resistance, which is still in its early stages, relies on the entire nation, united and sharing difficulties, to turn the tide. Therefore, it has ordered the people of the whole country to practice frugality and disaster relief, advocate the use of domestic goods, and ensure that profits do not flow out, harming the foundation of the country. This is a crucial measure in the war of resistance, and it is also the understanding that Chinese compatriots should have in the war of resistance. To advocate the use of domestic goods, the only requirement is to hope that all compatriots eradicate the mentality of greed for cheap things.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Suffering a loss is a gain," then cheapness should be a loss. Moreover, seeking cheapness at the point of the enemy's bayonet will lead to death!</p>
<h3 id="e165">"Da Zong Ri" in Shanghai <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>"When a son is grown, he needs a wife; when a daughter is grown, she should be married." This is an ancient "clear instruction," so all parents treat their children's "marriage affairs" very seriously. Not only must they be "well-matched in social status," but also the "eight characters" must be pressed before the Stove God and Bodhisattva for three days, and then a blind fortune teller must be asked to calculate the auspiciousness. This is the engagement procedure. The date of the wedding naturally requires selecting an "auspicious day and auspicious time" without any clashes. However, perhaps because "auspicious days and auspicious times" are hard to find, whenever the lunar calendar has a "long embankment head" (there is a saying in the countryside that villagers look at the lunar calendar for long embankment heads), men and women all squeeze their weddings on that day. This phenomenon is very common in the inland, but in Shanghai, it is difficult. Everyone knows that Shanghai is "an inch of land is worth an inch of gold." Perhaps a front building is wide-hearted enough by the second landlord to keep the common living room, but in this small living room, it is still possible to worship ancestors during festivals, but it is really impossible to set up dozens of tables for a wedding banquet. Thus, on this "auspicious day and auspicious time" "Da Zong Ri," every hotel and restaurant in Shanghai hangs a sign saying "Full," especially after becoming an "isolated island."</p>
<p>According to the manager of a large restaurant, their three-story building, the large restaurant in the front hall, is usually very deserted. Even if there are a dozen tables of banquets, it seems that the average small restaurant is already overwhelmed, but they still feel deserted and there is no lively atmosphere at all. However, once it's "Da Zong Ri," up and down, there are no empty seats, and it's still not enough to accommodate everyone, so they politely refuse customers. If the business of "Da Zong Ri" could be evenly distributed, opening a restaurant in Shanghai would definitely be profitable. Now, the "snack bars" attached to each restaurant are indeed for the needs of customers, and also to prevent those empty days from being too deserted and lifeless; moreover, they can at least earn some money to compensate for the empty room rent.</p>
<p>As for renting hotels for weddings, it's because there are not as many auditoriums as there are restaurants, and auditoriums must be reserved early, some even a year in advance. Now is the transition between winter and spring, which is the wedding season for Chinese people. On "Da Zong Ri," which restaurant or hotel entrance is not crowded with dense lanterns and people celebrating weddings?</p>
<p>Marriage is indeed a "major life event," but it seems unnecessary to be so extravagant and wasteful in getting married, some even borrowing money to maintain this empty facade. The city government's promotion of group weddings is to allow citizens to hold the most grand wedding ceremony at the lowest cost. However, the custom of "auspicious days and auspicious times" has indeed been broken, but those who participate in group weddings still want to have a large banquet once, the harm of "facade" is too great!</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, when all parties are shouting about frugality and disaster relief, we have indeed seen a few lines of wedding announcements published, or the banquet expenses donated to refugees. However, the customs passed down for thousands of years have not been completely broken after all. I wonder what a huge number is spent on a "Da Zong Ri"!</p>
<p>Stop being mired in superstition, empty facades, "If the Xiongnu are not destroyed, how can we have a home!"</p>
<h3 id="e166">After Watching "Three Knights" <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>A Fox Company production, showing at the Da Guangming Theater</p>
<p>When I tell you that this film "Three Knights" (Straight, Place, and Show) stars the Three Ritz Brothers, I don't think I need to explain to you what kind of thing this film is.</p>
<p>I don't know if you like their antics? As for me, I don't like it. Of course, because our living environments and personalities are different, perhaps we will also have differences in taste. For example, a pot-bellied foreign gentleman sitting next to me laughed several times while watching "Three Knights," but I didn't feel there was anything to laugh at. The reasons for laughter are complex: feeling that you are better than the other person, thus feeling that the other person's ugly态百出, then you laugh, this is one of the reasons; however, this feeling of being better must also be in line with taste to have, otherwise, that kind of pretentious action will only cause aversion.</p>
<p>I don't know what your taste is? So, there is no way to determine whether you will laugh after watching "Three Knights" (if you watch it too much, all the same, your laughter will also get tired), but there is one thing that is the same in us: when we step out of the theater door, and the cold wind blows, our minds are clear, the laughter is over, and what is left is a feeling of meaninglessness. So, we can't help but think of those meaningful, substantial plays we've seen before.</p>
<p>Of course, there must be exceptions, for example, you are originally satisfied with watching clowns tumbling and leaping tigers in the circus.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe you think I'm getting off topic, you want to know a little bit about what the content of this "Three Knights" is like?</p>
<p>To talk about content, "Three Knights" can simply be said to have none (you certainly know what the real meaning of the two words "content" is). Like arithmetic addition, there is only the superposition of materials, and the stories that are added up seem to be able to disregard reason.</p>
<p>If you want me to report a little bit about the material of this film, then I can report to you that there is a craze for horse racing, as well as two songs of unknown origin (that's because Israel Melman can sing), and inexplicable boxing, and then, that's the Ritz brothers' set of exaggerated to the point of being infinitely exaggerated movements - their signature skills. As for the Ritz brothers' equestrian skills, they are not high at all. If you have some basic knowledge of film production, you can see that this is either faked by photography techniques or replaced by a substitute.</p>

<p>Chapter 1: One-Armed Elder Organizes Freedom Village, Twin Daughters Pay Respects at the Martyrs' Cemetery</p>
<p>At that time, Zhu Airen knew that her grandfather had lost an arm, but he was still alive and well. Being disabled could not be said to be not disabled, but it was an honorable wound. Her mother was still an old peasant woman, and she was also healthy. Just because her daughter was a Western-educated student who had returned with gilded fame, she didn't put on the airs of an old lady. She might even take off her socks and still go barefoot into the fields during the busy farming season. However, now China's agriculture has also improved, and many places have already switched to using machinery, and the labor force of farmers has been reduced a lot. However, when someone advised this lady not to go to the fields, she would immediately shout, "Why not? Is farming shameful?" Zhu Airen also often returned to Freedom Village to visit her grandfather and mother, coming once or twice a month. She was naturally very happy to see Freedom Village developing day by day. Because this new village was painstakingly built by her grandfather. Although many people helped, it was able to flourish like this. But her grandfather seemed to be the head of the village. Her grandfather was not only the principal of Freedom Village Elementary School, but also the village chief of Freedom Village. Now I will say that since Zhu Airen returned from the United States, less than two years later, two female classmates came to the hospital to visit her. Those two female classmates were very dear to Zhu Airen when they were in the United States. And they graduated from the same university at the same time. However, Zhu Airen studied medicine, while they both studied crafts. After graduating in the United States, they also traveled to various countries in Europe for a week, and then returned to China together. Zhu Airen returned to her hometown in Jiangsu, and they also returned to their native Guangdong. It turned out that these two female classmates were both surnamed He, and were twins, both twenty-two years old this year. One was called He Shuangyu, and the other was called He Liyu. Want to ask who is the older sister and who is the younger sister? It's really impossible to tell. Because in the past, there were two sayings about twins: Whoever comes out of the womb first is the older brother or older sister, and whoever comes out of the womb later is the younger brother or younger sister. Another saying is that whoever comes out of the womb first is the younger brother or younger sister, and whoever comes out of the womb later is the older brother or older sister, because the one who comes out later formed in the womb first. In fact, this is only a difference of a few minutes or even tens of seconds, so what's the difference between before and after? Just like the He sisters, how can they be distinguished as Miss He Da and Miss He Er? You can only call one Miss Shuangyu and the other Miss Liyu. (9)</p>

<p>— Hangxie Zhaizhu</p>
<p>The Great Stage of the 20th Century</p>
<p>I don't know when China had theatrical magazines, but as far as I can see, "The Great Stage of the 20th Century" was the earliest. At that time, it was edited by the "Great Stage Congbao Society" in the autumn of Guangxu Jia Chen (1904). It was a 24-open road separate paper, with a single-color cover, titled by Zhu Suyun. The "Foreword" and "Inaugural Speech" were printed on red paper. The first insertion was images of Wang Xiaonong and Miyazaki Torazo, each on a page of copperplate paper, with inscriptions on the reverse. The one of Xiaonong was self-titled, very exaggerated. The poem said: Using copper clappers and iron plates as a career, competing to recognize the playwrights of the pear garden. This is the true face of Mount Lu, thoroughly smeared with rouge and powder.</p>
<p>Reversing the declining trend with great improvements, the sound is slow and the tone changes, vast and limitless. If it is wished to incarnate thousands, one old Wang in each singing stage.</p>
<p>The one of Miyazaki was titled by the pavilion chief of Chuihong. Later, Shi Huishi wrote a poem by Xiaonong. The "Inaugural Speech" was written by Ya Lu, stating that the purpose of printing "The Great Stage" was: "The descendants of the Yellow Emperor have suffered the poison of the Jiannu for a long time. The scholars and people of the Central Plains, resentful of the barbarian race, are everywhere. Only because the great righteousness of the nation cannot be popularized, the revenge of the country's destruction has been delayed. The organization now is actually based on the social thoughts of the whole country. Rise up in righteous armies, pull up the banner of Zhao and plant the banner of Han. In the future, when the people's intelligence is greatly opened, the rivers and mountains will be returned to us, and the pavilion of independence will be built to perform the magnificent and joyful plays of restoring the old things, overthrowing the barbarian dynasty, then China will live ten thousand years, and the great stage of the 20th century will live ten thousand years!" It can be seen that this magazine in the Qing Dynasty was actually revolutionary. The contents of the whole book are:</p>
<p>On the Benefits of Drama (Pei Ren) Biography of Yang Feihua, the Entertainer of the Southern Tang Dynasty (Pei Ren) Legend of Nanlewo (Jing An) Legend of Guilinhuan (Jingluzhu Ren) New Shanghai Opera Script (Xi Qiu) Changle Old Opera Script (Xiao Nong) Xiaohuncao Novel (Jingjisi An) New Water Margin Novel (Jingluzhu Ren) Stage Anecdotes (Chuihong Tingzhang) Xuanqu Zhi (Chuihong Tingzhang) Poems (Pei Ren, Xiaonong, Meng He, Song Cen, Gan Xing, E Lu, Huang Tian, Wu Men) Wishing Free God (Lover of Freedom) Criticism (Four Pieces) Liyuan Magazine (Eleven Pieces)</p>
<p>The author of "Anlewuo", Jing An, I don't know if it is Wang Jingan. The play performs the events of the Western Empress. Opening with "Zao Luo Pao": "Deep courtyard of sycamore trees, autumn wind is easy, secretly changing the fleeting years. The stars of gray hair age the beautiful face, afraid to wait for the dressing table to be seen in the morning. It is already light frost on the grass, short candles in the wind. How many times can you see spring flowers blooming, and the autumn moon is beautiful. It is good to feast in the hall, and do not put the golden cup shallow." This booklet contains the first "singing". It is not known whether the second issue or later has been published. The price of each booklet is two corners.</p>
