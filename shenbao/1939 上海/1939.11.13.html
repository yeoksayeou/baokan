<h3>蔣總裁致開幕辭</h3>
<p>重慶　第六次中央全體會議、蔣總裁致開幕詞、略謂、我們在總理誕辰紀念日舉行第六次中央全體會議、自從五中全會閉幕以後、到如今已有九個月了、這九個月中間、在我們國內敵人、以軍事進攻以外、加緊其政治進攻、和經濟進攻、在國際局勢上、發生了若干國家親疏離全的　　、到九月間、竟至發生了歐洲的戰事、這一塲戰局、發展到如何程度、以及怎麼樣的結果、到今天還不能預測、全世界人士、都在爲保障本國安全和恢復世界和平而苦心焦恩、所以過去的九個月、可以說是　幻多端的時期、我們因爲正在努力抗戰、一切國策、早經決定、所以立塲明確、　理簡易、可以用不　馭萬　、只是集中了全國的心思和力量、準備對着侵略我們的唯一的敵人而奮鬥、我們的任務、雖是艱觀，而心情却是十分的安定、大家只要想一想、假如我們二十六年七月七日不奮起抗戰、今天突然臨到歐戰發生這樣一個世界的大變局，我們國運的危險、和處置的艱難、將成一個怎麼樣的局勢、想到這裏、就應該對兩年又四個月以來英勇犧牲和堅忍奮鬥的無數軍民同胞的英勇、更深切的致其無限的崇敬與感念、今天我們舉行第六次全體會議、當然要檢討當前的形勢、反省過去的工作、確家此後的方案，同時要一致認識本黨責任的重大、與日俱增、確實已到了最後感敗的關頭、必頂更進一步的提　我們全國同胞、達成我們求得國家獨立自由、實現三民主義、以貢獻於世界永久和平的偉大使命、可是第一緊要的、就要我們全體同志、體認我在五中全會時所說、「確家決心和信心」的重要、認識我們中華民族在這個動蕩的世界中、應負的責任、認識彼我形勢的消長、和得道多助的必然性、認識日人最近發動訴謠言攻勢、和進行分化離間的拙劣無聊、認識我們今天堅定不移的努力所貢獻於當前國際局勢的重大、也要認識我們抗戰與世界安全禍福相一致的至理、過去九個月間、軍事和政治之經過、另有詳細的報告、我不必先爲敘說、今天全會開會、要保起大家注意的、就是我們在五中會時說明、我國「祇要不被帝制、不受欺騙、持久抗戰、奮們到底、則日人的失敗、已屬必然、」以及我在第三次和第四次參政會中所報告的、「日人兵力愚用愈細在軍事上已經一天天的窘迫、」而「我方軍事力量、比之開戰以前、更增加到一倍以上、從這幾個月中間、在晉南、在鄂北、尤其是近在湘北的戰役、大家都可以得到事實的證明、最近我在前方觀察的結果、可以告慰於各同志的、現在我們的士兵、不但俱有抗虞必勝的信念、而且各戰區官兵上下、更是普遍具有收復失土惟恐不速的心理、除此以外、更有一個顯著的進、就是軍中各種技術的進多、與捃行命令的順利、此次湘北勝利、與日人以制命的打擊、這是最主要的原因、更從民氣方面來說、這九個月以來、我們同胞、誓死不屑的正氣、格外提高、絕沒有稍知自愛的人土、肯受搖惑、他如後方活動的猛烈、濟南勢力的增強、以及國民公約的普遍執行、與軍民合作的進步、都是證明我們同胞不分智愚強弱老幼、已經認識彼我不兩立忠奸不并存的道理、這一次我在前方視察、親見親聞的事例、實屬不勝枚舉、有本來　　避難後退的民衆、遇見軍隊就自動的回到前綫、引導軍隊衝殺的、有自請加入隊伍奮勇作戰受傷不退以至殞命的、至於進退動止、無不絕對聽從命令、祇要聽到有利於抗戰、任何犧牲困苦、軍民協力、不分彼此、到現在這一種程度、在第一期抗戰中、是萬萬不及的、我　戰愈強、確是事實、我可以負責告訴各位同志、我們軍事、無論到什麼時候、在什麼情況之下、必能得到最後勝利、決不會先敗的、但正唯這樣、所以對方現在特別驚惶失措、自知侵華軍事、沒有辦法、要在軍事以外竭力進行、以挽回頹勢專意侵略的政策、近來正是進行得最支離變幻的時侯、因此我在今天全會開幕期間、要抱遠東大勢的歸趨、以及我們中國抗戰和世界安危禍福的關係、特別向各位同志說一說、第一、我們要揭穿日閥企圖的拙劣、是他惶念心理所反映、因爲歐戰發生、依照上次歐洲大戰的經驗、他一方面正可以乘火打刦、加緊侵略、他方面可以乘歐洲有戰事的時侯發展他的工商業、加強貿易體制的運用、但現在因爲他便略中國遭受着堅強的抵抗，他的所有方量、都來應付中國的抗戰軍事、而他國內產業、也全部爲侵華戰事而消耗、大好特機就要輕易失去、他這應心裏的悲哀、和希望中日戰事結束的迫急、是不可以言語形容的、所以一方面明知不夠號召的人、也要把他扶植起來、一方面要把遠東有關的各國、用着縱橫　　的策略次第分散、使他得遂其先以全力解決中國事變的好夢、總之是要把有關各國、一起穩住、但世界各國、不是都像他這樣的拙劣的、就他這兩個月來的進行來說、他顯然是惻重於對美對蘇的外交、而同時也不忘情於德國和英法、但他對美是一方盡量要求妥協、而一方面則要撕破九國公約、和破壞門戶開放、試問美國能容納麼、他對蘇俄現在是要盡力親善、但同時不肯忘情他國策、仍欲獨占滿蒙、試問這樣、蘇俄能否答應、尤其可笑的、他的對德國在今天的局面下、還要德國履行反共協定、試問德國做得到嗎、他的對英對法、始則壓迫侮辱、繼則又圖妥協、既要舉之拉攏、又要乘機南進、向南洋及英法荷遠東屬地發展、希圖取而代之、問法能受欺嗎、（詞長待續）（十二日電）</p>

<p>歐戰中之比利時與荷蘭二國，易遭魚池之殃。本報昨旣的略陳述之矣。據昨日電訉：德荷邊境愈趨緊張，其間之「無人地帶」有已發見德軍踪跡之說；而荷蘭政府且已就「洪水陣地」之一部分，挹永淹沒。事在二週之前，比王奧波德三世與荷蘭女主威廉明。會於荷京海牙，旋即聯名致電英法德三國元首。蓋二國開戰之後，俱曾表示：凡百建議，倘足爲和平構成公允而合理之妥善基礎者，願加考慮。比荷二王爰以此項表示爲根據，居間呼籲：請爲斡旋；並申請三國提示各種方法，俾爲樹立恒久和平，完成初步工作。一週以來，挪威國王哈康七世，、丹麥國主克利斯興十世。瑞典國王巨斯達五世，芬蘭國總統賈禮郁氏，聞風響應，從旁贊同，相繼電達比荷二王致意，於此北歐諸中立國之外，惟中歐羅馬尼亞國王加洛爾二世，亦相呼應；此外尙寂然。如美國，則由國務卿赫爾氏發表談片，謂「比荷政府未將聯合和平呼籲直接通知美國，亦未請美國與聞參加終止戰爭之任何努力；」他國所以寂然之因由，大率同此。最堪注意者，英法德三交戰國之元首，於接電之後，迄今閱一週，尙未置覆。英國方面，所傳首相張伯倫氏於九日「市長節」之集會時，將以演說爲非正式答復，乃是日稱病未至；委由財相西門氏代讀之演辭，語及比荷二王建議，顧謂希特勒未必有滿意之響應，而英國則當與與國及各自治領會商之後，始能作復云。德國元首希特勒氏於八日晚，國社黨十六週年紀念會席上，發表演說；法國總統勒勃倫於十二日晨，爲歐洲休戰紀念而作廣播演說；二者皆代表國家意願者也，顧乃曾無一語，及於荷比二王之建議。按之近數年來歐洲國際之語言戰爭，無往不復，如響斯應，每一回合，大都朝夕間事耳：備見唇鎗舌劍之能事，尤見各方之成竹在胸。無所遲疑；獨此次舉世睽睽於比荷二王之爲息戰而斡旋，而三國閱一週而各無表示，此則不能令人無所訝異者也。若謂比荷弱小，所言不為三國所重，故置不理；此則不然，蓋不但國際禮貌上不許不理，抑且於交戰之際：蘄求與國，鉅細不遺，雙方豈肯遺所謂弱小；况比荷在經濟上。軍備上，各有其相當之力量，尤不容視如無物。若謂三國勢如騎虎；欲罷不能，斯於呼籲和平，惟置不理；此亦不然，蓋交戰者旣各有所宗信，各就所信，等因奉此，相應電復可也，何憚於此翰墨之勞。若謂三國交戰，各有難言之隱，茲經友邦質詢，斯不免於訥澀耳，此又不然，開戰二月有餘以來，交戰國當局以昭吿天下者，旣不知其若干次，所言不盡衷情理，然皆灑灑洋洋，辯才無礙，詎於比荷二王不知所復。英法方面嘗傳倫敦與巴黎正相交換意見，並謂和戰之間。夙有堅定之範疇，惟答復之方式有待斟酌云；其實以電復電，由元首復元首，方式有其必然，謂待斟酌？亦托詞耳。昨據海牙電訉，謂德國駐荷公使才克氏，奉命往晤荷蘭外相克萊芬斯氏，謂德國政府方就比荷二王斡旋息戰事，從事縝密研究；夫如是云云者，若非德國具有侵犯荷蘭中立之決心，祇以佈置未就，爰以空言緩荷蘭之防，則所謂縝密研究固亦有可信之道，抑又不惟德國方面如此而已，英法亦有不得不縝密研究者在焉。英法稽未作復，其故亦在斯歟？誠以此次歐戰，其爭點之性質，後果之慘酷，友敵分野之複雜，政治思想與社會組織之基礎問題，在在有其歷史上之空前嚴重性；是以交戰國即使對於最後制勝具有絕對信心，，然對於軍事之外，戰爭之後，國際之間，實屬多所戒懼。戰者三國，而充量演變之結果，可使戰時局面以及戰後運命，非復交戰國所能自爲把握。德國自始利於速戰速決，及至近頃，希特勒氏亦於日前承認或須戰至三年或三年以上矣；英法二國，雖自始言稱準備長期苦戰，以迄全勝；然自開戰後之國際情勢所示，竊疑期望速戰速決者，殆又不惟德國。雙方茲所縝密研究者，殆以能否速戰速決爲和戰之中心問題也。</p>

<h3>日本軍官　中山泰德之自述　在赴大冶途中逃出　即向華軍某部投誠　現已由桂林抵粵北</h3>
<p>韶關通信、近在華中作戰之日軍官中山泰德、在由南昌赴大冶途中逃出、向華軍某部投誠、已由西南桂林行營派員護送至粤北、並已作數度廣播、茲紀該日軍官投誠經過及其經歷各節如左、</p>
<p>中山泰德、原籍日本大阪、現年二十四歲、係日方現役軍官、秉性剛毅、頗具正義感、自參加侵華戰爭以來、目擊日本軍閥之跋滬、與士兵厭戰情緒之激烈、大爲感動、深信此次日軍與師侵華、極反人道、毫無意義、終必自趨潰滅、華方正義抗戰、定能獲得勝利、故決心投誠華方、企圖革新祖國社會、打倒日閥、以拯救中日兩國民衆、而謀東亞之眞正和平、</p>
<p>據中山泰德云、少時家境淸寒、受完義務敎育後、即從事遞報販魚及木材商等、半工半讀、得修畢中學課程、並對法律學等、稍加涉繼、會因思想問題、一度投獄、及到達兵役年齡、乃被編「第一補充兵役」旋即編入「現役」、當中日戰爭勃發未久、即奉命入陸軍「預備士官學校」、畢業後、派在步兵第八聯隊服務、未及一月、復調第六團、遂於民國二十七年六月二十九日赴、上海轉寗國、充司令部情報班少尉班副、其後經蕪湖、參加黃梅·廣濟·武穴·田家鎭·及武漢攻略等役、本年二月九日、得密令參加南昌攻略戰、二月十六日、當赴大冶途中、經鄂城、遂乘黑夜逃出日軍、由當地民衆之引導、投入華軍、</p>

<p>據一般歡察、由於中山泰德投誠事實及其所述一切、可以確實證明、（一）日軍內部、早巳充滿厭戰反戰之思想、（二）日本軍閥、已失去精神上之統制力、（三）日軍將兵、因感戰爭前途難測、由苦悶而發生之暴行、益變本加厲、（四）中國之最後勝利、確有充分把握、所以西甫桂林行營尊重中山泰德之願望、特派員領導赴各戰區向前綫部隊官兵及後方民衆作詳細之廣播、（一）面實地貢獻前綫對日作戰之意見</p>

<h3>法國戰爭經濟力及其運用（續）</h3>
<p>— 級英</p>
<p>工業生產力之昂揚</p>
<p>法國戰爭力昂揚的理由之一，由於萊諾財政經濟政策之深能利用國際政治之不安，與英鎊地位之動搖，從而迅速解決國內之各項經濟事情，終於獲得進入發展之軌道；而一反過去數年間之惶惑不安與深刻之恐慌。</p>
<p>萊諾政策之主要目標，在於誘引「逃避資金之歸還」。故不惜採行右傾色彩之政策，一方减少財政支出，他方無情地提高工作時間，同時復將廣汎之權限命於達拉第，使彼處理國內之動蕩局勢。惶惑不安之法蘭西經濟，於是乃得重返發展之坦途。</p>
<p>如以景氣指數觀之：則已由去年六月之八三分提高至本年六月的一〇〇分（據S．G　．Ｆ調查，以一九二八年爲百分）。而特別好轉之產業爲礦業，建築業，鐵鋼業，機械工業，汽車工業等等。失業人數由去年七月之三四五千人減至本年同期之三二〇千人。輸出貿易額，由去年首七個月之　一百六十一億法郎，激增至本年同期的二百零九億法郎。因而入超額由去年之一百零五億　减至本年的七十八億法郎弱。於是證券市斱，大爲繁榮。如本年七月與去年同期較，股標指數已由二〇七分增至二三四分，債券亦自七六·五分漲到八四·三分，更令人注意者，尙推法蘭西銀行金保有額增漲率之猛烈。一九三四年末之保有額已降至八百二十一億法郎，至三七年末復激降爲五百九十億，而去年八月末竟於迅速間增大至九百七十三億法郎；超乎三四年來存額之上。由此可見其逃避資金回流之急速且大矣。</p>
<p>對外軍需調達能力</p>
<p>試一觀法蘭西之歷年的國際收支情况，即可知法蘭西之海外投資與海外債權與賠穀等之收入，實爲築成法蘭西資本帝國主義的最大礎石之一，法国之对外貿易雖常年入超，然其利息收入，竟時能抵消其五分之二乃至五分之四</p>
<p>以上。有如下表：</p>
<p>法國之國際收支（百萬法郎）</p>
<p>一九三五　一九三六　一九三七</p>
<p>收入項　六·三五〇　　八·六二五　六·七〇五</p>
<p>運租保險　一·四〇〇　一·八〇〇　一·二八〇</p>
<p>旅行費用　七五〇　一·一九〇　一·三〇〇</p>
<p>利息收入　四·〇〇〇　五·三七五　三·九二五</p>
<p>付出項　六·七五〇　　·六一五　一〇·七〇〇</p>
<p>貨物入超　六·〇〇〇　一一·六七五　一〇·〇五〇</p>
<p>外僑匯款　七五〇　九四〇　六五〇</p>
<p>支付超過　四〇〇　二九·三·三·九九五</p>
<p>Visible</p>
<p>資本入超額　——　六〇〇　二·二三〇</p>
<p>金流出額　——　二九·五〇〇</p>
<p>法國所擁之此項鉅額資金，在平時固如其社會經濟秩序之重累。以其浮動不定，常使財政金融受其騷動。但在戰時，對於國內資源貧乏之法國，實爲構成調達海外軍需品的最有力之條件。據萊諾財長最近之公開發表，法國擁有之黃金量已達五千噸之鉅。故對於長期戰事之前途，大發樂觀之論。其詢略謂：</p>
<p>「法國保有巨額黃金，支持長期戰爭，綽有餘力。法蘭西銀行庫藏二千五百噸左右，匯兌平凖基金，亦達五百噸，此外法國人在國外所存資金，在七萬萬法郎至一千萬萬法郎之間，折合黃金重量約二千噸，以上合計，共有黃金五千噸，國內民間所藏者尚未計算在內。</p>
<p>「他日遇必要時，法國仍可賂外國私人或政府方面取獲信用放款。關於此後，英法兩國所訂金融協定，足補兩國軍事與外交盟約。</p>
<p>「猶憶是次歐戰，即一九一四年至一九年間，法國對外貿易，進出相抵，平均每年損耗一百三十億法郎。五年總數共六百五十億法郎。其中除商船運費保險費八十億，法國人民所持外國證券一百三十億　，曁聯軍在法國境內費用一百六十億　，共收入三百七十億法郎抵消外，絀少二百八十億法郎，平均每年絀少六十億法郎弱。以當時滙價計，每年喪失黃金一千六百噸。衡諸法國現有資源，則長期戰爭前途，實可樂觀。」</p>
<p>戰時經濟制之編成</p>
<p>歐戰爆發後，英國即迭運分佈佈種種緊急的經濟法令，改造戰前自由主義之經濟組織，而進入強烈統制之戰時經濟體制。但法國則較爲緩慢，市塲上亦不若倫敦之緊張。惟里昂之生絲交易所曾於九月六日一度停拍；外匯股票等市塲猶照常營業。一般金融機關亦並不停市；國家對之，仍任其自由，不加干涉。</p>
<p>法國經濟之感應雖不若英國之深切，但達賴第政府之故作鎮靜，亦有以致之。誠以萊諾財政經濟政策之成功關鍵，一言以蔽之：在於恢復及維持市塲秩序，而使逃避資金之返國。然回歸之資金，並未全數爲生產界所消化；市塲苟一動搖，仍有爭先逃避之危險。歐戰勃發，情勢何等嚴重·設萊諾立即大肆干涉，適足以增大其人心恐慌。此達賴第之所以故作鎮靜，國際列車之所以復開之理也。國際列車之復　，　所以穩定市塲心理·人心旣定，從而改變經濟機構，乃得因勢利導之功。故法國政府　　財政金融緊急法令·實施匯兌管理，干涉　金買賣，不在戰爭勃發之初，而在國際列車　復行駛　之九月九日後，實具深長意義者。</p>
<p>回憶德　携手之初，法政府即於八月二十三日召集緊急　　，當即決定重要方案十餘條，其中主要者即召集　備兵六十萬人，承認和　最後關　應付實行之各種軍事法令，並將獨　大　授與達拉第，翌日，即頒佈戰時徵發令，並當即徵發市內汽車，以備軍用；其後一方　斷德法間鐵道，他方實施全國鐵道之徵發命　，目於同日實施使用金屬品之限制，二十八日及九月一日又頒佈輸出入禁止法令，九月二日上下兩院一致通過六百九十億法郎之戰時緊急預算，同時廢止法蘭西銀行維持三五％現金乃至外匯的發行凖備率之條例。四日又實施黃金國有政策。延長軍需工時至每週七十二小時，九日頒佈財政金融緊急法令，十日禁止醬輸出，管理外匯交易，禁止黃金買賣。其後又連續頒行「限制利潤」及「統制物價」等等法案，可知萊諾對於戰時經濟體制之編造，亦早已成竹在胸，且早在逐漸推行之中。（完）</p>
<h3>過去一週</h3>
<p>外匯突轉回縮，最後又在回鬆。據說「縮」的理由因受「日僞禁止法幣進出口」的刺激。鬆的理由，是在海關當局和各國駐滬外交團及洋商堅決拒絕和抗議。這種說法，似乎言之成理。其實不過是投機者有口可藉，趁此掀風作浪，從中漁利罷了。法幣在黑市塲上跌價太過份，洋貨售價漲到使進口商游手好閑，這是過去放長的根本理由。歐戰勃發，華僑資金回流，以及出口匯票浮動，與大戶搶低脫手，是促成續鬆的導火綫。鬆無止境，投機者正苦機會不再，日僞則因嫉　妬。於是一個雖明知無效，還是動作一番；一個雖明知無效，也趁機擾亂一番。無效到底是無效，結果還是回鬆。「鬆」有脚踏實地的基礎，「縮」只是捕風捉影的手法。問題是只在什麼時候才能「鬆而且定」</p>
<p>— 王四維</p>
<p>本市十月份工人生活費指數，較九月份計降一二·三六％。平民因此已得到不少安慰。但若仔細研究一下，降的僅燃料，食物　。衣着和雜項還在上漲。在氣候轉寒的今日，衣着商果可趁火打劫了。但事實所示，物價高漲，於平民生活，固然不利；就在工商業本身，也是沒有好處，只會使市面一天天衰落下去。上海在目前環境下，要使工商業復興發展，固是不可能；但求其能够穩定，也是迫切需要的。所以當前的問題，就在平定物價。此時，我們一面祈求各同業公會組織平定物價委員會，遏制投機操縱，竭力疏通來源；一面盼望人民自動節約，多多採用國產商品。但借「限價」或「積穀防饑」等美名，而行「刺激市面」與「以便抬價」之實的詭謀，我們應嚴厲反對。目前能確保平民生計的只有　種辦法。一個是請公正的租界當局辦理「平價」及「儲藏」；一個是市民自行聯合實行消費合作，並先從商號廠家的主僱間組織起來。</p>
<p>— 禾</p>
<p>據說國民政府預備撥款五千萬元，實施工廠被炸保險。這是參政會的決議。一個這家，在作戰的時候，實施被炸保險是一件急不待緩的事。大家知道，近代的戰爭，經濟的武器更佔重要，多炸毀一個工廠，使國家在實力方面多喪失一分元氣。所以在戰事期內，國家應竭力保護工廠。過往工廠雖處危險地帶，也無法向保險公司投保被炸險，因爲這虧本的生意，民營的保險公司是不做的。所以被炸之後，也祇有廠老　獨受損失，而間接就影響到國家的戰時工業。現在，由政府來辦工廠被炸保險，任何工廠，被日機炸毀之後，馬上可領到賠款，把工廠重造或修理，使在短時期內可恢復原狀。這不但使工廠主人可不受損失，問接更可保持國家作戰的實力。所以我們切盼工廠被炸險的能够在瞬息間實現。</p>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>三井洋行，連日搶蛋，自有其不顧體面的道理：這就因日軍前綫食料缺乏，營養不足，士氣大壞的結果，三井不過是奉令而行。但是「搶」有什麼用呢？蛋是要母鷄生的。只因日軍在淪陷區裏見鷄就吃，於是發生蛋荒。這比殺鷄求蛋更不是辦法。其實又何止蛋荒的理由是如此，豬，牛肉以及五穀，棉花，蠶絲等等的饑荒，也同一原因。日本財閥若要掠有中國市塲和原料，便去贊助軍閥們武力侵華。結果，中國市塲越窮，中國原料供給越少。事與願　，便想靠「統制」方式實行豪取強奪；結果更使淪陷區裏的生產日衰，購買力日枯。華軍因顧卹民艱，並未充分執行「焦土」政策。日僞此類舉動，不言助我完成「焦土」的目的。自食其報，當在不遠了。</p>

<h3>歐戰以來之中國經濟</h3>
<p>— 俞夑麟</p>
<p>歐戰爆發以來，中國經濟所受之影響，甚爲有利，可以一月來之事實成明。一般人士現當停止無意識之推測，根據現實討論中國所受之影響及將來之趨勢。茲將一個月來中國經濟所受之影響，詳細分析於次：</p>
<p>（一）對外貿易之有利　中國地大物博，雖失地甚多，但自由區域仍有無盡藏之富源，如桐油，豬髮，鋪　等重要物產，中國均爲天賦特厚者。今雖交通不便，運輸困難，但是等物產之輸出，均年有增加，至今已成爲抗戰經濟之支柱。桐油向以美國爲大主顧，雖有歐戰發生，未能減少其輸出；其他特產品亦然。羞以歐戰旣發，海外消費量大增，更足增加是等輸出量，故聞九月份由自由區域輸出者亦增高矣。</p>
<p>在淪陷區域方面，今年首八月中有驚人之入超，但自歐戰爆發後，以入超著名之上海，亦已變爲出超矣。由此可見世界各國對中國原料需要之迫切，惟恐供給之不足，是故中國對外貿易之前途，甚樂觀。</p>
<p>茲以上海之對貿易爲討論之中心。</p>
<p>自歐戰爆發後，因航行關係，英法德對華之貿易，大受打撃。九月份上海之進口貿易因此而銳減，出口因美銷增回而大增，故上海關又變爲出超矣。出超額達法幣一千七百枚十九萬餘元之鉅，實爲中國經濟好轉之現象。</p>
<p>在出口土貨之中，紡織　　之輸出，大量增加，達一千九百餘萬元之鉅，佔出口貨之首席。疋頭，紗綫編織品及針織品，與其他紡織品，亦有鉅額之輸出，三者合計達二千餘萬元。原料方面，如動物及動物產品亦有一千餘萬之輸出，礦砂金屬及雜糧茶等，亦均有大量之出口，由此可知，歐戰期中世界各國仰給於我國者，不限於原料。而輕工業製造品，亦在其列。在上海一埠之輸出品中，輕工業製造品已達輸出總額之半數以上。</p>
<p>以國別而論，上海對外貿易狀況，美佔首位，九月份對美之輸出遠二千萬元以上。輸入方面，日本爲第二，英德次之。輸出方面，香港爲第二，英次之，法屬安南又次之。</p>
<p>九月份上海一埠之輸出總額，達六千六百餘萬元，若以全國而論，則其數更鉅矣。如此之鉅數，恐爲悲觀論者認爲不可能之夢想也。此次中國在抗戰期中，尚能如此大量之輸出，則中國之生產力有無限發展之希望也。</p>
<p>（二）外匯高漲　自歐戰爆發之後，至今已一月餘矣，上海暗市塲之外匯價格，繼續放長，自八月之三便士半至今已漲至五便士餘，美匯自八月之六·二五元至今已出八元矣。此誠爲抗戰時期之好現象也。反觀日本，於歐戰爆發時對美匯價即降低一成，爲何我國能於此時高漲二成半？研究其結果，乃得下列之因素。</p>
<p>昔日投機家認爲法幣前途悲觀，於是爭購外匯，以致於三個月中，法幣之匯價自八便士跌至三便士半。今次歐戰爆發，一般人士對於英匯均有不安之心理，乃拋出英匯，對於美匯均認爲安全，亦有改進美匯者但爲靈敏甚少，惟紐約市塲之法幣價格，日漸增漲，所以上海暗市塲之美匯亦放長矣。近日來因湘北之故事利，外匯暗市更漲高，於是投機家對於外匯亦漸抱寒心，猛吐外匯，故造成三月來之最高價。</p>
<p>自歐戰爆發後，輸出劇增，且九月份上海已有千餘萬之出超，故暗市塲上之外滙供給，又增加不少矣。</p>
<p>近日以來，上海外滙暗市塲上，復有香港帮之猛抛，亦爲外匯入長之主因也。蓋香港自頒佈外滙管理令後，一切商業上之活動，均受限制，於是相率來滬。此次歐戰時，雖尚無吸引大量逃避資金來華之能力，但海外資金之流入，亦不可謂毫無。</p>
<p>以上列之事實，可知中國在歐戰期中，處於絕對有利之地位。輸出增加，足以促成中國經濟之復興，且可取得大量之軍需品，加強前方之作戰力。外滙之高漲，足以提高法幣之信用。兩此可知日人所施之海岸封鎖，破壞與強佔中國之民族工業，以及套取外匯使法幣趨於崩潰政策，徒心勞日絀而已。</p>

<h3>今日滬市淪陷紀念　各界益淬勵奮發　前年此日沉痛印象未泯　復與信念民衆永矢弗渝</h3>
<p>今日（十三）爲大上海淪陷二週年紀念日、本市各界一致沉痛紀念、但不下半旗、按前年十一月十日淸晨、日軍在浦東登陸後、連絡滬西日軍、進行包圍南市、浦江中之日艦、雖被阻於封鎖綫之北、但頻頻向南市方面發砲協助攻擊、天空日機、亦不斷投彈轟炸、華軍至十三日下午四時、始行撤退、日軍進駐後、南市繁華之地、盡爲大火籠罩、烈熖騰空、無異一片火獄、市房數千間、慘遭毀减、損失之大、奚可計數、日方對此紀念日、誠恐四郊流動華軍襲擊示威、故各地從事惶惶戒備、詳情如下、</p>

<h3>記郎靜山影展</h3>
<p>— 防風</p>
<p>如果先欣賞郎靜山先生的攝影，而後再晤見其人，必然感覺到相當驚奇。</p>
<p>郎靜山先生恂恂然有儒者風，態度很拘謹，談吐有條理，衣飾古樸，甚至於一舉一動，不像城市中人。你或者以爲他是一位學者，是大學講師，決不會知道他對於攝影有這樣的技巧和崇高的意境。然而靜山在攝影上的造詣，不是偶然的，他積許多年的經騐，加上繼續不斷的努力，時時與歐美各國攝影界保持接觸，所以能够與時代並進，有今日之成就。上月，震旦大學爲紀念攝影發明者達蓋爾百年紀念時，曾開了一個影展，福開森先生說，我們不應該空空洞洞地紀念達蓋爾，我們當追隨達蓋爾的精神，—就是倣效他苦心研究的精神。福開森先生又說，像郎靜山這人眞有達蓋爾的精神</p>
<p>靜山之於攝影，視爲一種藝術，能於刻板之紀象作用外，別求情趣：由機械的而化爲藝術的，他能以東方美術的意境，傳神到攝影上來，使人見了，油然而生美妙的直覺。我們嘗說：「畫中有詩，詩中有畫，」此其用意，是說作畫能畫出詩的韻味，寫詩能寫出畫的境界，這種功夫，非名家莫能爲之，但欲於片楮之上，兼具『亦詩亦畫』的情趣，惟靜山之攝影作品，有此風格。</p>
<p>今天，靜山將他此次遊覽西南的作品，在大新公司四樓畫廳公開展覽，參觀券的收入，悉用以救濟難胞。本埠字林，大陸，泰晤士各西文報紙，均出特刊兩頁，專載郎氏作品，這是中國攝影家的榮譽，值得大書的。</p>
<p>昨天薄暮，作者和徐澤人，張若谷，胡道靜三位，在滬西幽靜的小室內，晤到靜山，並且先期飽覽今天展覽的出品。</p>
<p>眞是目不暇接；抑且愛不忍釋，我們儼然游覽四川一回。這許多作品中，我們看到峨嵋余頂，白茫茫一片雲海，像飛絮，像海水，懸崖峭璧，驚心駭目，峨嵋之奇之秀，又與黃山不同，又看到重慶北碚溫泉，林主席飄飄欲僊，立在乳花洞前，背景是溫泉，如霧如烟，和崖石上垂下的藤蔓相映，頗有古趣。我們一面看畫，一面又聽着靜山的講述，同時我們又泛舟嘉陵江上，一攬小三峽之勝，這些亦詩亦畫的圖片中，讓我們欣賞到往來嘉陵江的小輪，像伏爾加船夫的一羣拉　者，還有細流若伏的瀑布。此後又看到縉雲寺和紹隆寺的勝跡，杉木源的塑像。再從重慶一路去觀光成都，當然哪，武侯祠，文殊院，靑羊宮，少城公園和薛濤井，都陳列在我們的眼前。這些富有歷史價值的畫景，非常和諧，美麗，而且自然。</p>
<p>秦蜀郡太守李冰，在灌縣治水，以「深淘灘低作堰」六字爲準則，數千年來，不復再有水患，在泯江上，有安瀾索橋，有離堆，都是李冰治水的遺跡，先民偉大的成就，眞是令人驚異，郎先生把這些古跡都拍取下來，使我們興起無限感慨。最可愛的是安瀾索橋，宛然一幅名畫。靑城山亦在灌縣，這裡可以看到冷杉和山巓的烟雲。</p>
<p>靜山對於題盡，亦有深切研究，譬如說「暮峽孤舟」，「巫山落日」，「寒林暝色」，「江村初曉」，這些句子，雖然是幾個字，但形容得非常眞切，恰到好處。作者愛看山水畫，尤注意於題句，曾憶林琴南所作山水一幅，有策驢者行山徑中，意境非常高曠，一看題詩，則爲「行近劍門吟更苦，一程山色一程詩」，當時欣賞的人，個個都拍案呌絕，認爲詩畫並皆精妙。現在看到靜山所題攝影，亦有往年讀畫的意境</p>
<p>窒息在孤島上的人們，你們不應該自餒，尤其是大上海淪陷二週年紀念的今日；你們眷懷着自由的中國；想念着整個活躍的西南，今天當以熱烈的心情，去參觀這有意義的攝影展覽，無疑地，你們能够看到四川，好像在祖國的懷抱中</p>
<p>最後，應當連帶紹介的，是中國旅行社最近出版的西南攬勝，這木書中，包括靜山今天展覽的全部作品，還有湘黔桂滇川各省的攝影，所有西南活歸姿態，均呈露在眼前。這本書今天同時在會塲發售。</p>
<p>我們祝郎先生此次影展的成功，同時更盼望大家去欣賞，因爲參觀劵資，是用以救濟難民的。</p>

<p>所負使命</p>
<p>否則義理偏頗坎坷之象、觼處皆是、得田於現代司法精神有所欿然歟、雖司法莊嚴之基石、奠於獨立審判之上、非任何機關所得干涉、惟判解一方爲代表國家行使法權之表示、他方卽確認當事人之行爲與事實、輕重出入、關係至鉅、吾人因於法理案情之需要、而加以研究、即在學術方面、自亦不失爲事後之獻替而有所裨補、查現代法制推事·檢察官·律師·爲司法上三大職務、司法精神、卽依些三大職務之實踐而表其尊嚴、例如法官檢察官審理或起訴案件、必須律師出庭辯護、闡明法理、於矜慎庶獄之中、尤寓有衡平弼輔之義、現今歐美各國學者、對於各級法院判解、詳加評論、刊行專集者、爲數甚多、不特促使法理之演進、亦令一部依恃法律地位而不負責任之法官、稍有所警惕、至此、主席袁仰安即宣讀律師公會執監委員會通過之判解研究會</p>

<h3>總理的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 夢白</p>
<p>昨天是總理的誕辰，因而使我想到　理的一生，在私生活方面，自奉甚儉。衹知爲國事而奔走，物質的享受是不在心上的。關於這，我們就總理的衣·食·住·行各方面都可看得出來。姑就參考書報圖照所得，把總理的衣·食·住·行·分述於後。</p>
<p>衣　早年時代總理老是穿着長袍小帽。後來奔走國事，幾度逃亡海外，除了穿華服之外，亦穿西裝。在光緒二十一年，總理三十歲時，率諸同志欲襲廣州爲根據地，就開設乾亨行於杳港，作爲總部，並設農學會於廣州。可是九月九日因運械不愼，事敗垂成，陵皓東等全死難，總理乃由廣州間道至香港東渡日本，旋即斷髮改裝，重遊檀島，推廣與中會。此亦爲總理服裝史上可記之一頁。晚年常穿將西裝改樣之便裝，就是現所稱的中山裝。當民元總理就任臨時總統，民六就任海陸軍大元帥時，先後會穿總統及元帥之服裝。而尤其值得一提的總理的服裝所用衣料多爲普通綢布，不用高貴的織物。</p>
<p>食　總理對於食一方面，中餐西餐都很隨便，對於飯菜，祇要果腹，不求豐美，而且遇到討論重大問題，計劃軍要黨務時，日以繼夜，忘記了吃東西也時常有的，在他以爲救國比吃東西要緊多呢！</p>
<p>住　總理的故鄉亦廣東中山縣　亨村，這是大家知道。在那邊，也有一所自建的住宅，但因爲農家出身，這住宅是帶有村屋，田舍的風光。後來總理離開家鄉，奔走革命，雖做過臨時總統，大元帥，但除了在上海的法租界，莫利愛路，有一所洋房以外，其他就沒有住宅。就是這所洋房，據說也是別人送給他的。</p>
<p>行　關於行的方面，我們可分兩種講法。在行走方面，總理也很隨便，不一定要坐高貴的汽車，普通的舟車，都要坐的。如果有事情，一想到要去做，馬上就走去做，絕不遲疑；在行爲方面，他倡知難行易之說，所以祗患不知迫，什麼應興應革的事情，他一知道就用大無畏的精神，勇往直前幹去。</p>
<h3>抵抗芥子毒氣的衣服</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>歐洲大戰最初發生的時候，波蘭和德國曾經劇烈的大戰過，雖然波蘭的華沙給德國的軍隊佔領了，但這並不是波蘭人的恥辱，這完全是德國政府甘冒大不題，放射芥子毒氣的緣故。超時代的殺人利器降臨到波蘭人的頭上，戰術武械並不柔弱的波蘭兵士也只能接受那悲慘的撤退命令了。</p>
<p>芥子毒氣是毒氣中的魔王，不但能够傷害人們的呼吸器官，並且還能侵蝕皮膚，當芥子氣彈從槍口裏或飛機上投射出來的時候，它立刻會變成　烟似的氣體　漫各處，兵士要預防它不相接觸，只有穿一件不通氣的衣服——抵抗芥子毒氣的衣服。</p>
<p>美國紐約Hobart大學裏有一位敎授名呌Bullart的，他發明一種藥汁，可以抵禦芥子氣，在這種藥汁內浸過的衣服，便能吸收芥子氣而使其失去毒性，那效力可延長至數月，軍士們除掉穿上這種衣服外，還得帶備手套，頭巾和特種皮鞋，假使波蘭軍隊早有這類防毒衣的設置，也許華沙不會失得這麼容易，但是那一種藥汁究竟呌什麼名詞，因爲美國政府對於這樁發明非常重視，事關軍事，暫時不能公開發表，將來終有一天會使芥子毒氣成爲廢物的，瞧罷！魔王的勁敵。</p>
<h3>蟹的諧話</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>持鼇把盞，是人生的樂事，在這秋高氣爽的季節，正是稻香蟹肥的時期，所以老饕們又一串串携向市　買醉，以充下酒的應時品，雖然孤島上，難民和貧乏者衆多，連食糧發生問題，但有錢的人，却自己先要享受口福要緊哩！至於蟹之爲物，因它脚多螯銳而且橫行的，所以一般人，都拿它來象徵兇橫殘暴者，更因它行動不正，認爲難以持久，便有：「看爾橫行到幾時一的警語！可是詩人的思想，却又不然，正代它解釋而露憫意：「明知穀觫原無罪，奈此樽前風味何，」這完全爲了口腹之慾吧。筆者且不加以批評，但憶一二議　，以博讀者一粲。</p>
<p>淸道人李梅庵，號稱一李百蟹，一是說他一餐能吃一百隻蟹，道却是好大胃口，但恐不實的吧？至於古今畫家中的畫蟹名手，着實不少，最妙的有某畫家，（一說即淸道人）善　蟹，但是索潤頗昂，每繪蟹一隻，必須一金，而且先潤後繪，有某氏嫌他索潤太貴，相商减半，給予五金，囑繪蟹十隻，某畫家唯唯吾否，隔日前往取件，見所畫十蟹，其佈置地位爲沿　口，倚石　，旁草叢等，盡屬半隻外露，某氏責其欺騙，畫家侃侃而言道：「上個半隻非五全隻嗎？以五金繪五蟹，潤例早定的何欺之有！」某氏默然而退。</p>
<p>相傳舊時某處農民，畏蟹如神明，莫敢捕捉，更不知可吃，所以羣蟹橫行稻采間，食榖大半，農民吿荒至縣署，縣長訽明害蟲形狀後，囑盡量捕捉到署，一時署中堆滿蟹筐，縣長更囑入廚煮熟，與署中人大嚼，農民爲之昨舌—然　後該處的人民，都效法而吃蟹了。此則似乎近於滑稽之談，然各地風俗不同，以中國內地與苗蠻未開化區域的食料相比，確大有不同，那末昔時某處的不敢吃蟹，或係事實，亦未可知的。</p>
<h3>衣食住行竹枝詞</h3>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>猪肝這樣東西，似乎是很平常的，但據醫生們說，它很有滋補的效力，吃了有益於身體，所以每天要是想不出什麼葷菜，那麼吃些炒肝油，不但經濟，並且是滋補的。炒肝油最普通的煮法，就是把雪菜切小了，入鍋同炒，雖沒有什麼特別的美味却也很可下飯。要是把新醃的白菜，代雪菜用，更覺爽口。倘不善吃油而單吃猪肝，那麼蒸熟之後，切成薄片，和醬麻油芹菜同拌，也很可口。此外如鷄肝鴨肝，也興猪肝有同樣的效力，味兒自然此猪肝更好了。</p>

<h3>談我國的「行」的演進</h3>
<p>— 社</p>
<p>行　的需要，是人與一切動物共有的，但是人不能像鳥那樣的有雙　飛翔，　那樣的有四蹄奔跑，和魚那樣的有鱗鰭游泳，因而假使沒有道路的開闢和一切交通工具的製造，則人的行動將處處受到自然的障礙，永無暢達的一日，同時，人類的文化亦將永不能發展，所以行的進步，對於世界文明的進步，有着極大的關係，現卽以我國的行的演進，述之於後：</p>
<p>先談陸路交通，在很早的游牧時代，人巳經知道利用牲畜和製造車輛了，如物原上說：「伏羲氏始乘牛馬，而制覇縻鞭杖，軒轅氏作輓輅，少昊制牛車」，而那時的道路，不過是山徑或平原上自然的途徑而己，到了周朝，政府便派有官員，專掌達天下的道路，而又把道路分爲「徑，畛，涂，道，路」五種，徑可容牛馬行，畛可容大車，涂容乘車一輛，道可容二輛，可容三輛以上者統稱路，同時車子又因駕馬的數目不同，也分出了許多等級，迨秦始皇併呑六國，欲令天下車同軌，書同文」，故修建全國的大道，賈山至言云：「秦爲馳道於天下，東窮燕齊，南極吳越，江湖之上，濱海之觀畢至，道廣五十步，三丈而樹，厚築其外。」同時又鑿劍閣棧道，以通巴蜀，這位大野心家在我國交通史上的功績，不可謂不大，接着三國時諸葛武侯又開闢了川滇古道，至此全國東西南北的陸路交通，可說已燦然大備了。</p>
<p>至於水路交通呢？在最古的時代也巳存在了，易繫辭上說：「刳木爲舟，剡木爲楫」，這卽是野蠻人用火將木燒空的獨木船，當然是十分簡陋的，嗣後累經改良，如物原云：「顓頊作篙槳，帝　作拕櫓，堯作維牽，夏禹作拕……伍員作樓船」，至是，舟楫的形式巳完備了，更有人把舟楫略加改造，成爲浮橋，即所謂「造舟爲梁」，至於眞正的橋梁的建築，直到戰國時才有呢！舟楫的改良，也很有成績，像晉王濬下益州的樓船，明鄭和渡南洋的巨艦，都是歷史上有名的，水道自隋煬帝開汁渠邗溝及南北運河，也便利了不少。</p>
<p>以上都是談我國在閉關自守時代的情形，至於近代呢？自十九世紀起，歐美方面有富爾頓發明了輪船，司蒂文生發明了火車，更有萊脫兄弟發明了飛艇，於是水陸交通外，增多了空中的交通，而這一切交通工具—輪船，汽船，潛行艇，火車，汽車，電車，飛艇，氣球，飛機等等都傳入了中國，同時鐵路，公路，電車路等都興築起來，而舉凡高空，崇由，大河，均不能爲「行」的障礙了，然若與歐美各國比較，則又有天淵之別，這是國人應當努力的。但看了近日的報紙，知道中央擬開發大西南，現正在興築鐵路，公路，這又足以使我們萬分欣慰的了。</p>

<h3>兩年</h3>
<p>— 黃自强</p>
<p>兩年了！大上海淪陷兩年了！但是那悲壯激動的情形，將永遠鐫刻在我的心頭，永速深印在我的腦海里。</p>
<p>是歐洲和平紀念的那天，我參加了外灘和平之神像前的追念儀式歸來，但是在距離咫尺之地的南市，正展開抵抗侵略者的序慕。</p>
<p>南市，這古老的城廂，在我，是最親切的生長之地呵！從我能够懂得自己是一個人的時候，我記得我家住的那條小弄是最可愛的一條弄堂，它貫通中華路和肇嘉路，但是一個外來的生客、他是永遠不知道這是一條最便利的捷徑，即使是於懂的抄近路的黃包車夫，也因爲弄口打着木樁的關係，不能在這小弄內穿過。於是，這小弄是我們孩子們的自由天地，踢球踢毽子不會有車輛來打擾，而最使我們高興的是互相避匿，讓對方在兩條大路上貫穿來往而不見人影。這是近乎迷宮一樣可愛的一條小弄。</p>
<p>一直到我揮淚別南市，我不忍遷出這條小弄，搬到出入比較便利的其他地方。這小弄給我的印象是太深刻了！</p>
<p>二年前的今天，我終於離別這二十餘年來的家，這慘痛的離別呵！</p>
<p>那時候，母親剛生病，病得很兇，不知費了父親大姊的多少唇舌，她不願意離開那所破舊的屋子。</p>
<p>「你們走吧！我的病或許不中用了！又喚不到車輛，你們帶了這許多東西，還能帶着我走吧！去！去！聽說法租界有好幾道鐵鬥巳關上了……」</p>
<p>這條弄內，第一天見到那樣恐慌混亂的情形，携老扶幼，手提肩挑，像逃荒者那樣互相傾　着向兩個弄口衝去。父親見到情勢緊迫，再不山母親的分辯，和大姊扶着她離別了我們的家，這小弄。</p>
<p>民國路上的車輛，人羣，箱物，擁塞着分不淸楚你的和我的，彷彿這天落着小雨，路上更濘滑難走。法租界的每—道鐵門口，都是黑壓壓地滿擠着人頭，母親被擠倒扶起者好幾次，她還是喊着「你們去吧！」可是那時她的聲音一點也聽不淸楚了。</p>
<p>彷彿做夢一樣，也記不得是誰帮助了我們一家四個人擠進法租界的，不過我記得那是個中年漢子，他說：「大家逃難，分什麼彼此？」</p>
<p>沒有兩個月，母親死了！五十三年沒有離開家，却死在外面，她最後的遺言是「我死也不瞑目的！」</p>
<p>兩年了！她的遺體還沒有安葬，而南市的家或許是一片瓦礫了吧？父親却總是憤怒地說：「不回南市，我不能替她安葬，我們應該記住她的遺言！」</p>
<h3>應募寒衣</h3>
<p>— 潘仲長作</p>
<h3>加膳費　原來先生做米生意</h3>
<p>— 某家長</p>
<p>一個月前，收到次男學校裏寄來的增加膳費單，一看要加六元，自己手頭雖有點困難，可是那費是加得有充份的理由的，倒並不以爲其不對。那時米要四十元左右一石，煤球要三四元一擔，醬油鹽醋那一樣不漲價，府房怎能以未漲價時所收的膳費來維持呢？我還覺得僅加六元還會不够的。眞的，撇開了自」己的經濟狀况不管，做過當家人的，不會不諒解那時廚房老闆們的苦衷的。</p>
<p>前幾天，長男學校也寄來一張增加膳費通知單，我覺得驚奇。驚奇它不早一月寄來。一月前，正是各物飛漲的時候，現在市價到底跌了許多了，爲什麼漲價時不加，而跌價時都反要加呢？並且還要加三十元，加原數百分之六十呢？</p>
<p>長男學校的宿費三十元，膳費五十元，假使現在再加三十元，那末膳宿二項，一學期就得一百一十元，試問那一所學校的膳宿費，有這樣地鉅大的呢？長男來說，校裏的小菜，壞得可憐，一碗豆芽可用四次，第一次靑燉，第二次上面蓋上幾槐肉皮，第三次和綫粉合燒，第四次還可早晨過粥。這當然我不會完全相信長男的話的，他或許會形容過度，不過祗少也可看出小菜壞的一斑。但是長男校裏組有學生膳食委員會，此次加費，該會就向廚房交涉，交涉的結果，發現這筆加費，並非廚房的權利享權利者是另有其人。因爲這次廚房根本沒有向校方要求加費。各物未漲價前，校方給廚房的是每日每桌元半，漲價後加至二元四角一桌，但學生所付的五十元膳費，己足够給廚房每桌二元五角了，比漲價後校方給廚房的，每桌尙多一角一日。假使現在再加三十元，這筆鉅費不是完全落在學校當局者的袋裏嗎？現在姑且不管外面的物價怎樣，祗要呌校方說出所以增加前理由。假使是爲物價上漲的緣故而加的，那末請不必費心，因爲利害相關的廚房老闆，根本沒有請學校當局加費啊，假使是爲了其他原因面加的，那末也請說出理由來使大家明白才對。</p>
<p>理由來了！長男說過，學校裏的先生們，都「兼做」米生意，他們在三四十元時，吃進了大量的米，不料現在一跌，便要大大蝕本，於是以原價再盤上利錢，硬賣給廚房。但廚房還是足够維持，所以這次加費的原因，非在物價漲，非在廚房不能維持，而實在收到錢的學校手裏。他們會借一個小風浪吞下一筆鉅款，不過，聽說該校學生自治會，巳起來反抗了。當然，我們不願在這國難嚴重時期中敎育界再有什麼不幸的事件發生，可是我做家長的，總不願把錢無理由地送入學校的手裏。</p>

<h3>President Chiang Kai-shek's Opening Address</h3>
<p>Chongqing. In his opening address to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, President Chiang Kai-shek stated in brief: We are holding the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee on the Prime Minister's birthday. It has been nine months since the closing of the Fifth Plenary Session. During these nine months, our domestic enemy has intensified its political and economic offensives in addition to its military offensive. On the international front, there have been shifts in the relationships of various countries. In September, the European war broke out. The extent of this war and its outcome cannot be predicted today. People around the world are working hard to safeguard their national security and restore world peace. Therefore, the past nine months can be said to be a period of great uncertainty. Because we are working hard to resist the war, all national policies have been decided early, so our position is clear and our governance is simple. We can use a simple strategy to manage a complex situation. We only need to concentrate the minds and strength of the whole country and prepare to fight against the only enemy that is invading us. Although our task is arduous, our mood is very stable. Everyone only needs to think about what the dangerous situation of our national fortune would be, and how difficult it would be to deal with it, if we had not risen up to resist the war on July 7, 1937, and today suddenly faced such a major change in the world situation caused by the European war. Thinking of this, we should pay our deep respect and gratitude to the countless soldiers and civilians who have heroically sacrificed and persevered in their struggles for two years and four months. Today, we are holding the Sixth Plenary Session to review the current situation, reflect on past work, and determine future plans. At the same time, we must unanimously recognize the increasing importance of the Party's responsibilities. We have indeed reached a critical juncture in the final victory. We must further inspire our compatriots across the country to achieve our great mission of seeking national independence and freedom, realizing the Three Principles of the People, and contributing to lasting world peace. But the most important thing is for all our comrades to realize the importance of "establishing determination and confidence" that I said at the Fifth Plenary Session, to recognize the responsibility that our Chinese nation should bear in this turbulent world, to recognize the ebb and flow of the situation between us and the enemy, and the inevitability of those who have the Dao receiving more help, to recognize the clumsy and ridiculous nature of the Japanese's recent launch of rumor offensives and divisive tactics, to recognize the great contribution that our steadfast efforts today make to the current international situation, and also to recognize the truth that our resistance war is consistent with the safety of the world. The military and political developments of the past nine months have been detailed in other reports, so I don't need to repeat them here. What I want to emphasize at the opening of today's plenary session is what we stated at the Fifth Plenary Session, that our country "as long as it is not controlled by imperialists, is not deceived, persists in resisting the war, and fights to the end, the failure of the Japanese is inevitable," and what I reported at the Third and Fourth National Political Consultative Conferences, that "the Japanese military force is becoming increasingly exhausted and militarily in a more and more difficult position," and that "our military strength has more than doubled compared to before the war." From the battles in southern Shanxi, northern Hubei, and especially the recent battle in northern Hunan, everyone can get factual proof. As a result of my recent observations at the front, I can tell all comrades that our soldiers not only have the belief that they will win the war, but also the officers and soldiers in all theaters of war have the common desire to recover lost territory as soon as possible. In addition, there is a significant improvement, that is, the improvement in various military technologies and the smooth execution of orders. The victory in northern Hunan and the vital blow to the Japanese are the main reasons for this. Furthermore, in terms of public morale, in the past nine months, the spirit of our compatriots who are determined not to yield has been greatly enhanced. No one with self-respect would be tempted. Other examples, such as the vigorous activities in the rear, the strengthening of economic strength, the universal implementation of the National Covenant, and the progress of military-civilian cooperation, all prove that our compatriots, regardless of their intelligence, strength, weakness, age, or youth, have recognized the principle that we and the enemy cannot coexist and that loyalty and treachery cannot exist together. The examples I personally saw and heard during my inspection at the front are too numerous to mention. There are people who originally retreated to seek refuge, but when they met the army, they voluntarily returned to the front to guide the army to fight. There are also people who volunteered to join the army and fight bravely, refusing to retreat even when wounded, and even sacrificing their lives. As for their actions, they all absolutely obeyed orders. As long as it is conducive to the war of resistance, no matter what the sacrifice or hardship, the military and civilians cooperate and do not distinguish between each other. This level was completely unattainable in the first phase of the war of resistance. The stronger we fight, the stronger we become is indeed a fact. I can responsibly tell all comrades that our military, no matter when or under what circumstances, will be able to achieve final victory and will never fail first. But precisely because of this, the other side is now particularly panicked and at a loss. Knowing that there is no way to continue the military aggression against China, they are doing everything possible to carry out policies of aggression other than military ones to reverse the decline. This is the time when they are carrying them out in the most fragmented and erratic way. Therefore, during the opening of today's plenary session, I want to talk to all comrades about the trend of the Far East situation and the relationship between China's war of resistance and world safety. First, we must expose the clumsiness of the Japanese warlords' plot, which is a reflection of their panic mentality. Because of the outbreak of the European war, according to the experience of the last European war, on the one hand, they can take advantage of the fire to intensify their aggression, and on the other hand, they can develop their industry and commerce and strengthen the use of trade systems while Europe is at war. But now, because they are being strongly resisted in their invasion of China, all their strength is being used to cope with China's war of resistance, and their domestic industries are also being consumed by the war of aggression against China. The great opportunity will be easily lost. Their sorrow in this situation and their urgency to end the Sino-Japanese war cannot be described in words. Therefore, on the one hand, they have to support those who are obviously not qualified to call, and on the other hand, they want to disperse the countries concerned in the Far East one by one by using the strategy of dividing and conquering, so that they can realize their dream of resolving the China Incident with all their strength first. In short, they want to stabilize all the countries concerned, but not all countries in the world are as clumsy as they are. Judging from their actions in the past two months, they have obviously focused on diplomacy with the United States and the Soviet Union, while at the same time not forgetting Germany, Britain, and France. But their attitude toward the United States is to try to compromise as much as possible, while tearing up the Nine-Power Treaty and destroying the Open Door Policy. Can the United States tolerate this? Their attitude toward the Soviet Russia now is to try their best to be friendly, but at the same time they are unwilling to forget their national policy and still want to monopolize Manchuria and Mongolia. Will the Soviet Russia agree to this? What is especially ridiculous is that their attitude toward Germany is that in today's situation, they still want Germany to fulfill the Anti-Comintern Pact. Can Germany do this? Their attitude toward Britain and France is to oppress and humiliate them at first, and then try to compromise. They want to win them over and take the opportunity to advance south to Nanyang and the Far East colonies of Britain, France, and the Netherlands, hoping to replace them. Can France be deceived?

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Europe's Thorough Research into Peace Appeals</h3>
<p>Belgium and the Netherlands are easily caught in the crossfire of the European war. This newspaper briefly mentioned this yesterday. According to yesterday's dispatches: the German-Dutch border is increasingly tense, and there are claims that German troops have been spotted in the "no man's land" between them; moreover, the Dutch government has already deliberately flooded part of the "flood defense line." Two weeks ago, King Leopold III of Belgium and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands met in The Hague, the Dutch capital, and immediately sent a joint telegram to the heads of state of Britain, France, and Germany. After the two countries declared war, they both stated that they were willing to consider any suggestion that could form a fair and reasonable basis for peace. Based on this statement, the Belgian and Dutch monarchs acted as intermediaries to appeal for mediation and requested the three countries to propose various methods to lay the groundwork for lasting peace. For a week, King Haakon VII of Norway, King Christian X of Denmark, King Gustav V of Sweden, and President Kallio of Finland responded in kind, expressing their support from the sidelines and sending telegrams to the Belgian and Dutch monarchs. Among the neutral countries of Northern Europe, only King Carol II of Romania in Central Europe echoed the call; otherwise, there has been silence. As for the United States, Secretary of State Hull issued a statement saying, "The Belgian and Dutch governments have not directly notified the United States of their joint peace appeal, nor have they asked the United States to participate in any efforts to end the war." The reason for the silence of other countries is largely the same. Most noteworthy is that the heads of state of the three belligerent countries—Britain, France, and Germany—have not yet responded a week after receiving the telegram. On the British side, it was reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain would give an informal response in a speech at the "Lord Mayor's Show" on the 9th, but he was absent that day due to illness; the speech read by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon instead referred to the suggestions of the Belgian and Dutch monarchs, saying that Hitler might not respond favorably, and that Britain would only be able to reply after consulting with allied countries and dominions. German leader Hitler delivered a speech at the 16th-anniversary meeting of the Nazi Party on the evening of the 8th; French President Lebrun made a radio address on the morning of the 12th to commemorate the European armistice. Both represented the will of their nations, yet neither made any mention of the proposals of the Dutch and Belgian monarchs. According to the linguistic warfare in European international relations in recent years, there has always been an immediate and echoing response; each round has mostly been a matter of morning and evening, demonstrating the prowess of verbal jousting and, even more so, the confidence of all parties involved. There has been no hesitation. However, this time, the world is watching the Belgian and Dutch monarchs mediate for a truce, and the three countries have shown no response after a week, which cannot help but surprise people. If one were to say that Belgium and the Netherlands are weak and their words are not valued by the three countries, and thus ignored, this would not be the case. Not only is it impermissible in terms of international etiquette to ignore them, but also in times of war, seeking cooperation with other countries, no detail is spared, how would either side dare to overlook the so-called weak ones? Moreover, Belgium and the Netherlands each possess considerable strength in terms of economy and military preparedness, and cannot be disregarded. If one were to say that the three countries are in a situation where they cannot dismount from the tiger they are riding, and therefore can only ignore the calls for peace, this would also not be the case. Since the belligerents each have their own beliefs, they can simply reply accordingly based on what they believe. Why fear the effort of writing a response? If one were to say that the three countries at war each have unspeakable secrets, and are therefore bound to be hesitant in the face of friendly inquiries, this is also not the case. Since the war began more than two months ago, the belligerent countries have made countless announcements to the world. While their words may not be entirely sincere, they have all been eloquent and unhindered in their arguments. How could they not respond to the Belgian and Dutch monarchs? It has been reported that London and Paris are exchanging views, and that there is a firm category between war and peace, but the method of response is still under consideration. In fact, the method of replying by telegram, from head of state to head of state, is inevitable. To say that it is under consideration is merely a pretext. According to a dispatch from The Hague yesterday, the German envoy to the Netherlands, Mr. Zech, was ordered to meet with the Dutch Foreign Minister, Mr. Kleffens, and informed him that the German government was conducting a thorough study of the Belgian and Dutch monarchs' mediation efforts to cease hostilities. If this is the case, then unless Germany is determined to violate Dutch neutrality, and is merely delaying Dutch defenses with empty words while preparations are not yet complete, then the so-called thorough study may indeed be credible. Moreover, it is not only Germany that is in this situation; Britain and France also have reasons to conduct a thorough study. Is this the reason why Britain and France have not yet responded? Indeed, this European war is unprecedentedly serious in its nature of contention, the cruelty of its consequences, the complexity of the divisions between friend and foe, and the fundamental questions of political ideology and social organization. Therefore, even if the belligerent countries have absolute confidence in ultimate victory, they are, in reality, very apprehensive about matters beyond military affairs, after the war, and in the international arena. Three countries are at war, but the resulting changes may lead to a situation in which the wartime situation and the post-war destiny are no longer within the control of the belligerent countries themselves. Germany initially favored a swift and decisive victory, but recently, Hitler also admitted that the war might last for three years or more. Britain and France, although from the beginning, claimed to be prepared for a long and arduous struggle until complete victory, judging from the international situation since the outbreak of the war, it is suspected that Germany is not the only one hoping for a swift and decisive victory. What both sides are now thoroughly studying is whether a swift and decisive victory can be the central issue of war and peace.</p>
<h3>British and French Heads of State Telegraph Replies to Dutch and Belgian Appeals: The Key to Lasting Peace Lies in Germany; Solutions Adapting to British and French Policies Can Be Considered; German Authorities Declare Thorough Study of Various Proposals</h3>
<p>London: Following the peace appeal by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, King George VI of Britain has recently sent separate telegrams in reply, stressing that a lasting peace must be secured before hostilities can cease. The telegrams stated, "We are determined to seek a glorious peace, and the basic conditions have been clearly stated. As can be seen from the documents made public since the beginning of the war, the cause of the war and who bears the blame are clear. In short, Germany's aggression against Poland is the direct reason for our country's decision to participate in the war. Moreover, Germany's policy towards its neighbors has always been dominated by aggression, and the trampling of Poland is just one example. Our people only resorted to force after all efforts to maintain peace failed. The greater goal of this war, as our Prime Minister said, is to eliminate the fear of German aggression among European countries, so that nations can maintain their independence and freedom, thereby preventing other countries from using force again instead of resolving international disputes through peaceful means. This goal has been repeatedly supplemented and clarified. The statements made by our Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 12th of last month, and by our Foreign Secretary in the House of Lords on the 2nd of this month, are detailed. Furthermore, all solutions must take these statements as essential elements in order to lay the foundation for a lasting peace. If Your Majesty is willing to share any suggestions from Germany that are consistent with our country's war goals, our government will seriously consider them." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: Following the peace appeal by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, French President Lebrun sent a telegram today, stating, "We have received your telegram and deeply admire your insightful views. In today's world, no nation is more peaceful than the French, nor is any nation willing to accept greater sacrifices for European peace. France is determined to welcome all measures that can establish a fair and lasting peace for all nations. This has been the case in the past, and it remains so today. This attitude has been expressed repeatedly. Only a peace based on justice can be a lasting peace. Since two years ago, the use of violence and force has been common, the most solemn agreements have been disregarded, all promises have been broken, and three countries in Europe have been enslaved or destroyed. The security of other countries has also been threatened. France has therefore taken up arms, hoping to stop this secret affair. The unfair treatment suffered by Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland under violence must be compensated, and at the same time, they must be given sufficient guarantees in politics and economics so that the freedom of all countries can be respected. Only then is it possible to lay the foundation for a lasting peace. In short, humanity must be certain that violations of justice will not happen again in order to eliminate fear and anxiety. Any solution that serves to confirm an unjust victory can only bring about an unstable truce for Europe, which is vastly different from the legitimate and lasting peace that Your Majesty has called for. All countries whose security and independence have been threatened by Germany's actions hope to restore this precious peace, but the key to peace lies not in France but in Germany. Whether peace can be restored depends on the country's declaration." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>The Hague: Semi-official sources have recently announced that German envoy Zech was instructed by his government to visit Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and informed him that the German government is conducting a thorough study of the Belgian and Dutch heads of state's mediation efforts to cease hostilities.

<h3>Centennial Celebration of the U.S. Army War College: Roosevelt Instructs on the Path to Peace: Striving to Eradicate Hatred and Fear from All of Humanity; Correcting Past Mistakes and Establishing a Peace of Freedom</h3>
<p>Washington: Today marks the centennial of the founding of the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia, and also the twenty-first anniversary of the armistice ending the last European war. President Roosevelt, as he had to go to the cemetery of the war dead to preside over the ceremony, used the telephone to convey a message to the school, stating, in brief, that what we pray for is peace, and the only goal of our country's military expansion is to create an environment that can establish a free and lasting peace. Moreover, the peace we need must be better than the peace that resulted from the last European war, so that all of humanity in the world can abandon the hatred and unconscious desires that created the era of terror. This new and better peace is what all of humanity is eagerly praying for. At this moment, the American people are determined to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors, abide by their legacy, and work for peace. But history proves that peace cannot be based on weakness, and we must never deceive ourselves with wishful thinking. Especially in today's situation, we must be deeply vigilant. In short, we are now seeking a simple language so that countries and people can communicate openly, and the nature and ideals of people of all countries can be free from all shackles of fear and fully express themselves. This is the path to peace, and I will sincerely and earnestly work to find it, as I have in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. Moreover, this great goal is not only what armed soldiers should devote all their efforts to, but also what the general public, who want to base freedom on lasting peace, should work together to achieve.

Mayor La Guardia gave a radio address to Europe, speaking of the difference between this armistice commemoration and previous ones, stating, in brief, that the peace that was restored twenty-one years ago has now been destroyed.

<h3>The Pope Explains: The Source of All Evil Lies in Failing to Distinguish Between Good and Evil</h3>
<p>Vatican City: Pope Pius XII addressed the American bishops today, stating that the root of all evil in the world lies in failing to distinguish between good and evil. Many schools in the United States neglect Christianity and reject teachings that are not within the scope of nationalism. The high number of divorces shows that more Christian moral principles should be adopted. Labor and management should also cooperate to protect the rights of both parties in accordance with fair and honest regulations. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>British Queen's Broadcast: A Message to the Women of the British Empire: Modern Women Must Also Contribute to the War</h3>
<p>London: Queen Elizabeth of Britain delivered an armistice speech tonight to the women of the British Empire in simple and moving terms, saying that for twenty years, we have used this day as a day to commemorate the deceased and never forget them. Why is it that the peace created by our sacrifices has now been destroyed, and we are forced to fight again? I know that you wish me to express, in the name of the women of the British Empire, our deep sympathy for the women of Poland who were the first to suffer the cruel blow. We also do not forget the courage of the women of France. From ancient times to the present, women have had to possess a resolute spirit in times of war. Although in the past, women felt that their efforts for the war could not contribute much, the situation is now very different. We women, like men, have important work to do ourselves. This mission has now arrived. The Queen then spoke of family separations, husbands going to war, and children being scattered, saying that the King and I know this suffering. Women of all countries now yearn to rebuild a better new world so that all people in the world can enjoy a day of peace. This day will eventually arrive. I know that you will be able to fulfill your responsibilities and that when we have struggled to win lasting peace, we will be able to freely and unhinderedly devote ourselves to the greater happiness of mankind. We believe in God. In times of hardship, God is our strength. I earnestly pray that God will forever bless you and guide you. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

The Telegraph reported that the news obtained by its correspondents did not correspond to this alarming promise, and that the German newspapers still maintained a calm attitude towards the Netherlands. When German military plans had not yet been announced, the situation in the Netherlands was indeed very delicate, but in recent days, there has been no reason to determine that the situation has deteriorated. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Brussels: According to reliable sources, the Belgian cabinet held a cabinet meeting yesterday to study the attitude that Belgium should adopt when Germany invades the Netherlands. Although no communiqué was issued afterwards, there must have been important decisions. Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot also had a long conversation with Defense Minister General Denis after the cabinet meeting. In addition, Foreign Minister Spaak also met with Dutch Envoy Sluyter this afternoon, presumably to inform him of the cabinet's decision yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Belgian Defense Minister Denis delivered a radio address last night, stating that if Belgium wants to stay out of the war, it must have a strong military as a backing. War is a tragedy for humanity, and the Belgian army is sufficient to guarantee Belgium's freedom. The future is bright, and we have full faith. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, the claim that island countries are permanently immune from enemy invasion is not a sacred law. The times may have suddenly changed. Whether island countries with insufficient military equipment are not attackable will be proven by facts in the future. The victory or defeat of a war should be determined by courage and ideals, not by fixed traditional principles. Once a country has decided to go to war, its isolation, which has been maintained for centuries, may for the first time encounter the pain of war. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>The Situation in Germany: Calm and Composed</h3>
<p>Berlin: Abnormal weather in Germany in October affected agriculture in many places, causing farmers to be able to engage in harvesting work only for a short period of time. At the same time, because many farmers have responded to the call to join the army, women have also engaged in this work, harvesting crops such as potatoes and turnips. The National Hitler Youth specially organized men, women, and children in various places to go to the countryside to work. The German military authorities also issued an order for soldiers on the front line to rush to the west to engage in harvesting work. Now, with the help of the army, the crops in the west have been harvested in just a few days. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The people of Germany have now begun to prepare to celebrate the first wartime Christmas. Every family still buys Christmas trees as in the past. In Berlin alone, 850,000 trees will be needed, 100,000 of which will be donated by charitable organizations to poor families, and the rest will be sold at estimated prices. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Quiet on the Western Front</h3>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters issued war bulletin No. 137, stating, "Several enemy aircraft flew over the northeastern part of our country last night. Today, the front line is quiet." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters issued war bulletin No. 138, stating, "Last night, troops from both sides engaged in battle in a certain area on the front line." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance Reviews Next Year's Budget</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Because the next session of the Diet is scheduled to convene on December 23, the Ministry of Finance is now rushing to review the budget and revenue estimates. According to the preliminary investigation in yesterday's meeting, it has been found that the estimated regular revenue for the next fiscal year, excluding income from public bonds, will reach ¥3,352,043,000, an increase of ¥275,232,000 compared to the estimated revenue for the current fiscal year. Because the planned revision of the tax system has not yet been decided, the estimate of tax revenue is still based on the current tax system. If the planned revised tax system is implemented, approximately ¥730,000,000 can be additionally collected, bringing the total regular revenue for the next fiscal year to ¥4,080,000,000. At the same time, the total amount of public bonds to be issued in the next fiscal year will exceed ¥5,000,000,000, of which ¥1,000,000,000 will be used to make up for the shortfall in the general budget, and ¥4,000,000,000 will be used for extraordinary military expenses. However, the review of these expenses is still in progress. Because some public bonds for the current fiscal year have yet to be issued, the Ministry of Finance will further tighten spending and strengthen financial control next year. The Ministry of Finance completed a preliminary organization of the budgets submitted by each province yesterday, and the ministry will begin reviewing the budgets of the Army, Navy, and other departments starting next week, reserving the final decision.

<h3>Stalemate in Soviet-Finnish Negotiations: Soviet Demands Threaten Independence, Finland Declares No Further Concessions</h3>
<p>Helsinki. The Moscow official "TASS News Agency" today issued a statement saying that the Finnish government holds an "uncompromising" attitude. The Finnish Foreign Ministry has specially responded, saying that the Soviet government proposed talks, and then put forward proposals that Finland believes threaten its independence and neutrality. Finland has already made considerable concessions on issues affecting Soviet security, especially in the Leningrad area, but given the nature of Soviet demands, Finland has no choice but to take preventive measures. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Moscow. The British "Daily Express" recently published a dispatch from Helsinki stating that Stalin had rejected Finland's latest concessions. TASS has been authorized to declare that this report in the "Daily Express" is completely inconsistent with the facts. It is found that Finland has not made any new concessions recently, so Stalin has no possibility of accepting or rejecting such a non-existent new concession. According to information obtained by TASS, Finland has not only not accepted the Soviet Union's minimum proposals recently, but has also reduced the possibility of reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Finland. Recently, Finland has dispatched two to three divisions of troops to the Karelian Isthmus, confronting Leningrad, and has now increased to seven divisions, expressing its uncompromising attitude. (TASS, 11th)</p>
<p>Helsinki. Finance Minister Tanner is now in Moscow, together with the Finnish Ambassador to Sweden, Passikivi, conducting negotiations with the Soviet authorities. He recently reported the progress of the negotiations to the government authorities by long-distance telephone. It is said that the representatives of both sides exchanged views with each other yesterday. It is still difficult to predict the outcome of the negotiations. In addition, the Finnish delegation has not yet continued to seek instructions from the government. As for the saying that the negotiations may be suspended, the official side has neither confirmed nor denied it. However, people here generally commented on the denial published by the Soviet TASS News Agency, and said that if Germany takes action against the Netherlands and Belgium, countries around the world will inevitably have no time to take care of the situation in the Baltic Sea, and the Soviet Union will inevitably re-exert pressure on Finland. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Helsinki. According to Moscow news, Soviet-Finnish negotiations have not yet reopened. Yesterday, both sides exchanged memoranda, detailing their views, but did not determine the date for the resumption of the meeting. It is generally expected that the Finnish delegation will be recalled in the near future, and negotiations will be conducted through normal diplomatic channels. People here believe that the Soviet Union is attempting to prolong the negotiation time to change Finland's stubborn attitude. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Helsinki. The Finnish Foreign Ministry recently replied to the statement issued by the Soviet Union to Finland last night, stating that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations were initiated by the Soviet Union, and the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the negotiations were considered by Finland to be a threat to Finland's independence and neutrality. Regarding the security requirements of Leningrad, Finland has made concessions. At the same time, Finland has had to take various measures to protect its neutrality due to the Soviet Union's various demands. At present, the Soviet-Finnish negotiations seem to have reached a deadlock because the Soviet Union does not intend to resume contact with the Finnish representatives in Moscow.

<h3>German Plane Attacks French Ship in English Channel: Two Bombs Dropped, Both Falling into the Sea</h3>
<p>London. A French ship carrying more than ninety passengers was sailing from a French port on the English Channel coast to England today when it heard an air raid alert. Then a German plane appeared in the sky. The French anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire and drove it away. The ship also set sail. When it reached the middle of the journey, the German plane came back to attack, dropping two bombs in total, none of which hit. In an instant, three Allied destroyers from Britain and France flew to fight, and the German plane immediately fled. The ship was able to continue sailing. According to a passenger, "The German plane was circling above our heads, seeming to dive straight down and drop bombs. Fortunately, three British planes came to intercept it, and the German plane fled. Both of the bombs dropped by the German plane fell into the sea, one of which was only 120 yards away from the ship. The hull was not damaged. Our planes finally drove the German plane away. The sound of machine guns could be heard clearly." According to a female passenger, "Although the enemy plane attack was thrilling, all the passengers were able to remain calm, and some people whose cabins were below deck did not even know that the ship they were on had been attacked by enemy planes." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Hu Shih Talks About World Federation</h3>
<p>New York. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih took advantage of Armistice Day today to broadcast on the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, advocating the establishment of a world nation, taking the federal system, and the obligations and responsibilities must be extremely clear. According to Dr. Hu, the League of Nations in fact cannot serve as a league of Europe, which is the biggest fatal wound. An international government that cannot implement laws and order is an illusion. The future international government must be a supreme world federation. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>China Peace Society Calls on the U.S. by Telegram</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The Chinese branch of the International Peace Movement Conference today sent a telegram to Stimson, Chairman of the American Committee to Not Assist Japan's Aggression, and Aichibao, Chairman of the American Peace Movement Conference, stating, "Your tireless efforts for peace have deeply moved us. Although Ambassador Grew's speech in Tokyo was extremely appropriate, it is still necessary to continue to work to ensure that the U.S. position is thoroughly implemented, especially to impose sanctions on Japan, which has violated the treaty, and should not be easily let go. Today, all peace-loving nations earnestly hope that the United States will strengthen its actions. We hope that the United States can comfort our hope." The telegram was signed and sent by Shao Lizi, Vice Chairman of the International Peace Movement China Branch. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Self-Description of Japanese Officer Nakayama Yasutoku: Escaped While En Route to Daye, Surrendered to a Chinese Army Unit, Now Arrived in Northern Guangdong via Guilin</h3>
<p>Shaoguan Correspondence. Nakayama Yasutoku, a Japanese officer who recently fought in Central China, escaped while en route from Nanchang to Daye, surrendered to a Chinese army unit, and has been escorted to northern Guangdong by personnel sent by the Southwest Guilin Headquarters, and has made several broadcasts. The following is a record of the Japanese officer's surrender and his experiences.</p>
<p>Nakayama Yasutoku, originally from Osaka, Japan, is 24 years old this year. He is a Japanese active-duty officer, with a resolute nature and a strong sense of justice. Since participating in the war of aggression against China, he has been deeply moved by the recklessness of the Japanese warlords and the intense war-weariness of the soldiers. He firmly believes that this Japanese military's invasion of China is extremely inhumane and meaningless, and will eventually lead to its own destruction. China's just resistance will surely win victory, so he is determined to surrender to the Chinese side, with the intention of reforming the motherland's society, overthrowing the Japanese warlords, saving the people of China and Japan, and seeking the true peace of East Asia.</p>
<p>According to Nakayama Yasutoku, he had a poor family when he was young. After completing compulsory education, he engaged in delivering newspapers, selling fish, and timber merchants, etc., working and studying at the same time, and completed the middle school curriculum. He also dabbled in legal studies, etc. He was once imprisoned for ideological problems. When he reached the age of military service, he was assigned to the "First Supplementary Military Service" and then incorporated into the "Active Duty." Not long after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he was ordered to enter the Army "Reserve Officer School." After graduation, he was assigned to the 8th Infantry Regiment. In less than a month, he was transferred to the 6th Regiment. On June 29th of the 27th year of the Republic of China, he went to Shanghai and then Ningguo, serving as the Second Lieutenant Deputy of the Intelligence Class of the Headquarters. After that, he participated in the battles of Huangmei, Guangji, Wuxue, Tianjiazhen, and the capture of Wuhan via Wuhu. On February 9th of this year, he received a secret order to participate in the Nanchang capture battle. On February 16th, while en route to Daye, he passed through Echeng, and took advantage of the darkness to escape from the Japanese army. Guided by local people, he joined the Chinese army.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his surrender to the Chinese side, he worked in the guerrilla team belonging to the certain war zone for two months. Then he worked under Commander Fan of the guerrilla team in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi for nearly a month, engaged in the guidance of guerrilla tactics, etc. Finally, because his original intention was to be in the revolution, he greatly admired the fame of the anti-aggression writer Rokuchi Wataru, and urgently wanted to meet him. So he went to Guilin via Changsha. He has been in Guilin for three months, engaged in anti-Japanese propaganda work and contributing opinions on anti-Japanese operations, etc. Therefore, considering his motive for joining the Chinese side, and after detailed inquiries by the Southwest Headquarters, observing his intentions, confirming that he was sincere.</p>
<p>According to general observations, the fact of Nakayama Yasutoku's surrender and everything he said can definitely prove that: (1) The Japanese army is already full of war-weariness and anti-war thoughts. (2) The Japanese warlords have lost their spiritual control. (3) Japanese officers and soldiers, feeling that the future of the war is unpredictable, the atrocities caused by their depression are becoming more and more serious. (4) China is definitely confident of final victory. Therefore, the Southwest Guilin Headquarters respects Nakayama Yasutoku's wishes and specially sends personnel to lead him to the front-line troops and the people in the rear in various war zones to make detailed broadcasts. (1) Provide opinions on anti-Japanese operations on the front line in person.</p>
<h3>Setbacks for Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Invasions Are Repulsed, Now Maintaining Only Local Disturbances</p>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence. Military affairs in northern Jiangsu have been quite quiet in the past two weeks. According to news from the military authorities, the Japanese army launched simultaneous attacks from all directions on the 2nd of last month, increasing their troops and deploying eight or nine planes and dozens of warships and motorboats. They originally intended to take Gaobao in one fell swoop, open up the canal line, and then capture Yancheng and clear the Fan Gong Dyke. Although the western route was fortunate enough to occupy Wodou, it also encountered a serious blow from the Chinese army, and the canal line was never opened up. The repeated gains and losses of Sishui and Jieshou are still in the hands of the Chinese army, so that the Japanese army failed to complete its original plan. Although the Japanese army on the eastern line advanced bravely, the Chinese army, in addition to giving them a head-on setback, also used strategic tactics to open up the front, transfer troops to both sides, and lure the Japanese army into the depths, allowing them to occupy the empty city of Yancheng, and then encircle and annihilate them. After the Japanese army sneaked into Yancheng, they regretted that their isolated army had entered a dangerous place, so they turned their heads and fled north. They were intercepted and pursued by the Chinese army, and their corpses were scattered all over the field. The Japanese army was almost completely wiped out, and their appearance was extremely embarrassed. Although the Japanese army in Huai'an repeatedly attacked Cheqiao, Fenggucun, Donggou, Yilinta, Ertou, Cuibao, and other places, they were all met with fierce resistance from the Chinese army and were defeated. Therefore, the Japanese army's attempt to capture northern Jiangsu failed to achieve success. So they send planes every day to bomb the Chinese army's various front lines and villages and towns at will to vent their anger, but it has no impact on the Chinese military. Therefore, in the past two weeks, the Japanese army has stopped large-scale offensives against northern Jiangsu and only maintained local disturbances.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Righteous Church Bombed by Japanese Planes</h3>
<p>Hanzhong. According to the Italian priests Chevallier and Bellotti to our reporter today, the Italian Catholic Church in Hanzhong was bombed by Japanese planes on October 25th and October 30th. The material loss of the church is more than 500,000 yuan. When Japanese planes bombed Hanzhong on October 25th, the church was only hit by one bomb. However, when Japanese planes bombed Hanzhong on October 30th, the church was hit by 20 bombs. Although no one in the church died as a result, there were five injuries. The church's nunnery and dormitory, which could accommodate hundreds of orphans, have been completely destroyed. The church's medical department was severely damaged. Now the buildings in the church have become a ruin. According to the two priests, there are no military targets around the church. When the Japanese planes bombed, the Italian flag was raised on the roof of the church, and its tall bell tower was enough to show that it was a church. (United Press, 12th)</p>

<h3>Situation of Chinese Army Progress in Guangdong Province: Northern Route Recaptures Many Strongholds, General Offensive on Dongbao Deployed, Qiongshan Recaptures Dongshan City</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence. The Chinese army in Guangdong Province has recently planned a counterattack against the Japanese army, which has been basically determined. The regular army and guerrillas on all fronts have also taken the opportunity to operate. The following is a record of the recent situation:</p>
<p>Zengcong. The Chinese army on the Zengcheng and Conghua fronts in northern Guangdong launched a large-scale attack for days. On the evening of the 18th, Peng's division from Conghua attacked the area north of Zhongluotan from a certain place, sweeping away the Japanese army in the suburbs. The two sides fought fiercely for several hours. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and collapsed to the rear. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and continued to kill many along the way. At about 11:00, they charged into Zhongluotan. The Japanese army in Taihe City fought fiercely in the streets, and a large number rushed to reinforce along the road. The fighting continued until dawn. The Chinese army safely withdrew after completing its mission and continued to surround the Japanese army, waiting for an opportunity to strike again. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, dozens of guns were captured, and the Japanese military headquarters, power plant, radio station, etc. in Zhongluotan were destroyed. The Japanese side suffered heavy losses. Also, at 1:00 AM on the 18th, a certain regiment of Liang's division on the right wing of the Zengcong front attacked the Japanese army along the Guangcong Road. At about 2:00, they encountered the Japanese army at Baitianling. The Chinese army used hand grenades to destroy the Japanese barbed wire and charged into the Japanese position. The two sides then engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Subsequently, the Chinese army continued to join the battle. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was unable to support and retreated along the road to Shigang. Baitian then fell into the hands of the Chinese army. In this battle, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. On the evening of the same day, at 6:00 PM, a Chinese army commando team suddenly attacked Lianzhougang, Dunhexu, and other places one mile from the suburbs of Shigang, killing more than 40 Japanese soldiers and destroying many important Japanese fortifications. Now, the suburbs of Shigang are under the control of the Chinese army. As for the Huaxian area, the Chinese army along the Guanghua line has made continuous progress in the past week. The fighting in the suburbs of Longkou and Longxiang was fierce. On the morning of the 18th, the army artillery bombarded Longkou from the south of Huaxian and engaged in artillery battles with the Japanese army for about two hours. Then a certain unit of the Chinese army charged into the battle through the hail of bullets and successively recovered the strongholds in the suburbs of Longkou, besieging Longkou. The stalemate continued throughout the 18th. Many Japanese soldiers were killed. At dawn on the 19th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Longxiang along the Guanghua line. Because the Japanese army was unprepared, they were heavily charged and engaged in street fighting, killing more than 100 people. The fierce fighting was still going on at noon.</p>
<p>Dongbao. The Dongguan and Bao'an military bureaus have consulted on a general offensive plan, which has now been deployed. In recent days, Chinese army units have been frequently mobilized along the Guangjiu Railway, Wanzhang Road, Bulong Road, and Tangtian Road. The counterattack on Dongguan military affairs is presided over by Xiang Hanping, and the counterattack on Bao'an military affairs is presided over by Yu Zuzhang. Wang Ruozhou's unit of the Fourth Guerrilla Column has been reorganized and trained in rotation to become a mobile force, concentrated for surprise attacks, in order to launch guerrilla warfare. As for the Japanese and puppet troops in Wancheng, Shilong, and Taiping, three to four hundred people have been reinforced from Guangzhou and Xintang in recent days, with the purpose of assisting in guarding the strongholds. Chinese army guerrillas and detectives have sneaked into the inland areas of Wancheng, Shilong, and Taiping, waiting for the opportunity to move. In addition to the guerrillas, the self-defense groups gathered in various villages have also joined the battle, commanded by Zhang Wodong, the magistrate of Dongguan County.</p>
<p>At 1:00 AM on October 17th, the Liu Fayu unit of the first battalion of the Chinese army guerrilla team attacked the Japanese army at the Shengdu Ferry in Wancheng from the Wanjiang Ferry, and also attacked the Japanese army stationed at Xinglong Bridge from Rongshujiao. These two places are the outposts of the Wancheng Japanese army, used to guard against Chinese army attacks by water. At that time, there were only fifty or sixty Japanese soldiers at these two outposts, who responded in panic and reported to the Shimizu unit headquarters of the Japanese army in the city by wireless telephone. The two sides fought fiercely for about half an hour. The Japanese army retreated from Xizhuangmen into the city. The Liu unit took advantage of the victory to burn down the Japanese army's camp and pursued them to the Ximen Minjiao Hall and the main street outside the North Gate. The Japanese army had four machine guns deployed on each of the four city towers in the east, south, west, and north, and closed the city to defend it to the death. The Chinese army besieged the city along the walls. At dawn, they retreated to their defense area and will wait for an opportunity to launch another counterattack. Now, the major and minor traitors in Wancheng are extremely frightened and have secretly sneaked into the attached city. The puppet Dongguan County Magistrate Zhang Kouhong and the Japanese advisor Ishikawa have stayed deep inside and have not come out. In the past, the Japanese army would go to the countryside once every six days to collect taxes and extort chickens, ducks, fish, pigs, grains, and other items. Now, because they have been repeatedly attacked by Chinese army guerrillas and commandos, and are afraid of suffering losses, they dare not go to the countryside to collect them. The Japanese army in Wancheng has recently experienced a food shortage and is suffering from edema and beriberi. The houses in the park are used as hospitals.</p>
<p>Qiongya. The Chinese army on Qiongdong Island has inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army. They have continued to work hard in the past week. There has been continuous progress on the Chengmai and Qiongdong fronts. At dawn on October 12th, the 15th Regiment of the Chinese Army Security Forces attacked Dongshan City, which is located between Qiongshan and Chengmai. About 200 Japanese and puppet troops stationed there stubbornly resisted from within strong fortifications. The Chinese army first cleared the Japanese troops in the suburbs and then launched a large-scale siege of the city. The two sides charged several times and remained in a stalemate for a day and night. The Japanese army was gradually suppressed by the Chinese army and concentrated their main force to break through the encirclement and retreated towards Haikou. On the verge of leaving, they looted and set fire to the city. There are no Japanese troops in Dongshan City now. The Chinese army is appeasing the refugees and handling the aftermath. In this battle, forty to fifty Japanese soldiers were killed, and many military supplies were seized.</p>
<p>It is found that the Japanese army on Qiong Island has been constantly attacked by the Chinese army in the past ten days, and all fronts have reported defeats, showing a tendency to total collapse. The commander of the Japanese army stationed on Qiong Island, Major General Iida, has urgently telegraphed Guangzhou for help. Therefore, the Japanese army on Qiong Island has increased again in recent days. Several hundred Japanese and puppet troops arrived by transport ship on the 14th and 15th and landed in Haikou. In addition, eight Japanese warships have sailed to Haikoumen Bay to unload military supplies. These reinforced Japanese troops were all transferred to defend Haikou and Chengmai in western Qiong Island. As for the Qiongdong area, it is still maintained by puppet troops. At present, there are more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers, more than 500 war horses, and forty to fifty planes on the entire island. The Japanese army is afraid of attacks by the Chinese army guerrillas and dare not move out. All strongholds and important roads are covered with electric nets, and armored vehicles are used to transport sentries when they change shifts. The situation is embarrassing.</p>
<p>According to intelligence from military agencies, since the outbreak of the European War, the Japanese army occupying the Yulin Port area in Yaxian County has been actively deploying military vehicles. The airfield that was previously under construction near the port has recently been stepped up, and high-pressure tactics have been used to send Japanese soldiers to search for Chinese men everywhere, forcing them to work. The daily number of people is as high as 10,000, working day and night. All workers are given a living allowance of 3 military coupons per day, but the people hold a deep sense of justice and are unwilling to be used by the Japanese side. Therefore, villagers in Yaxian and other places have fled.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Dinghai Controls Four Townships in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Defends the City</p>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence. After Dinghai County Magistrate Su Bentshan was ordered to recover the county seat, he immediately convened political workers and outstanding youths in Dinghai to organize a war political work team to eliminate bandits and rogues, establish wartime primary schools, rescue wounded soldiers and sick people, and publicize the resistance against the war and the recovery of the city. The people, unable to bear the oppression of the Japanese, have also joined the army one after another, working together to recover the city. Recently, the General Headquarters of the ××× Army Group has appointed the ×××× Regiment to be transferred to Dinghai. Therefore, the Chinese army in Dinghai is strong and its offensive is huge. As a result, the 20 townships of Dasha, Baiquan, Xiaosha, Ganzhi, Jingtao, Cengang, Chaizheng, etc., and the major islands, are all under the control of the Chinese army. All the important roads in the townships are heavily guarded. As soon as the Japanese army leaves the city, they will be discovered by the Chinese army. A few days ago, several hundred Chinese soldiers led by County Magistrate Su went to the vicinity of Bei Zhi Temple to challenge the Japanese army in the city. However, the Japanese army kept the city gates tightly closed, tightened martial law, and did not dare to respond. The Chinese army threw leaflets with warnings to the traitors into the city and then returned to a certain township's defense area, waiting for an opportunity to launch another counterattack.</p>
<h3>Puppet Organizations Compete for Tobacco and Alcohol Taxes</h3>
<p>Merchants Suffer Heavy Taxes, Deeply Feeling Unbearable Pain</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence. After the counties in Jiangnan were occupied by the Japanese army, the puppet organizations held various "tax affairs," such as the puppet provincial government's tobacco and alcohol tax and the puppet financial department's license quotas and other taxes, all setting up bureaus to collect taxes. As for tobacco and alcohol merchants who have silk tax goods in the puppet provincial bureau, if they are transported to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Anhui, and other places, they still have to pay taxes to the so-called "Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau." Because the two provinces of Zhejiang and Anhui are under the unified jurisdiction of the puppet tax bureau, and are not collected by the puppet provincial departments. The puppet unified tax bureaus in the occupied areas have respectively established the so-called "Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Branch Bureau XX District Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Branch Bureau," which mutually collect taxes with the Jiangsu Province XX Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau established by the puppet provincial government, each acting on its own and preventing the puppet provincial government from collecting tobacco and alcohol taxes. The puppet provincial government's financial department has repeatedly ordered the puppet branch bureaus in various counties to prevent the "Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Branch Bureau" from collecting taxes, claiming that they have received orders from the puppet executive yuan. As such, the two sides compete for each other, causing tobacco and alcohol merchants to pay two taxes on one item and are unable to bear the pain.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Dongting Mountain: The Evil Deeds of the Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>Blatantly Levying Exorbitant Taxes</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The western part of Dongting Mountain, Suzhou Prefecture, with a circumference of over eighty li, is an isolated island in Tai Lake. The people in the mountains are simple and honest, mostly making a living by raising silkworms and fishing, which is enough to keep them fed and clothed. After the area fell into enemy hands, a scoundrel named Qin Panshi colluded with the puppet army under Cheng Wanjun and, relying on Cheng's power, organized the bogus Xishan Restoration Committee in a state of anarchy. He appointed himself as the chairman and committed all kinds of evil deeds, forcibly occupying married women, kidnapping people for ransom, and extorting from door to door. Anyone who slightly disobeyed was subjected to poison. Furthermore, he levied exorbitant taxes on the local fish, shrimp, and vegetables, taking thirty percent of everything. The villagers are extremely distressed and eagerly hope that their fellow villagers in Shanghai will find a way to relieve their suffering.</p>
<h3>Chao'an Puppet Organization Celebrates While Chinese Army Teams Launch Surprise Attack; Six Japanese Camps on the Chao-Shan Line Destroyed</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese troops invading Chao-Shan have suffered repeated attacks from the Chinese army in the past month. On the evening of October 25th, the Wang Battalion of the Sangpu Mountain Security Team attacked the Japanese troops at Yonghou Bridge, located in the central section between Anbu and Shantou. At the same time, the Chinese army's plainclothes teams dug up six sections of the railway from north of Anbu to Huamei Station, isolating the Japanese troops stationed at Anbu, Baolong, Chuanlutou, Zhuanglongshan, Anbu City, Taiheshi Malong, Wenli, Longxi, and Neilong, preventing them from receiving external support. The Chinese army then burned down six Japanese camps in one night, killing and wounding more than 150 Japanese and puppet troops with hand grenades. Fujita, the captain of the Japanese company stationed at Longxi Middle School, was seriously injured and was taken back to the Shantou Bo'ai Hospital on an electric boat on the 26th for treatment. The Japanese commander stationed in Anbu, Horino, arrested more than 1,000 nearby farmers the next day and forced them to repair the section of railway from Shantoa to Huamei. However, on the same day, the Chinese army of Anjie took advantage of the incomplete repair of the Chao-Shan Railway and launched a fierce attack on the western suburbs of Chao'an City. That day happened to be the establishment of the puppet Aftermath Committee of Miaocheng. Zhang Weichen, Zhou Zhizhen, and others held so-called celebrations in Zhongshan Park in West Lake. The preparatory office of the puppet Aftermath Committee was located in Diaoyoushe, built by Hong Zhaolin. At nine o'clock that evening, just as everyone was in high spirits and the banquet had not yet ended, Chinese army teams sneaked into the nearby suburbs. With a signal, machine guns and bombs were fired intensively at the Jiuqu Bridge of Diaoyoushe, and the Japanese camp at the foot of West Lake Mountain was burned down, killing and wounding more than 130 Japanese and puppet troops. The Japanese troops in the city, caught off guard, suspected an internal mutiny and were on alert, daring not to leave the city. It wasn't until ten o'clock that the Chinese army, having completed its mission, retreated to Fengxi, its original defense position. On the 27th, the Wu Qiwai Department of the XXX Group Army of the Chinese side had approached the suburbs of Chao'an City. The Chinese army artillery positions on Zhugao Mountain remotely bombarded the Japanese artillery on Dongjin Bijia Mountain. From 9 a.m., the two sides exchanged artillery fire, the rumble shaking the mountains and valleys. In the evening, Chen, the commander of the Chinese army's advance team, led his troops to the vicinity of Yixi, destroying three Japanese transport vehicles with explosives, killing and wounding five or six people. On the morning of the 28th, the gunfire outside the northwest gate of Chao City became more intense, and pedestrians in the western suburbs were cut off. At night, only the sound of gunfire and the sound of autumn wind and autumn waves could be heard, causing the villagers who had not escaped to feel terrified.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Oppressive Government Is Fierce as a Tiger; Popular Resentment Fills the Air</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar: Kunshan Correspondence: Kunshan is a rice-producing area. In the past, when new grains were harvested, rice prices always tended to fall. Although this year's autumn harvest is still abundant, rice prices have continued to rise due to transportation difficulties, recently breaking the 20-yuan mark. The reason for this is that traffic between urban and rural areas is blocked, making it difficult for farmers to sell. The puppet county government also imposes heavy taxes and levies, extracting at every level. Rice merchants seize the opportunity to monopolize and hoard. Recently, smaller measuring instruments have been found on the market. These unscrupulous merchants only know how to make profits and disregard morality, which is truly heartbreaking to speak of.</p>
<p>Malaria Epidemic: Kunshan was a crucial location when it fell, resulting in many deaths. As a result, epidemics were rampant this summer, extraordinarily rampant. Since autumn, a type of malignant malaria has broken out, which is very dangerous. When the illness starts, there is only fever and no chills, and dizziness. Without continuous treatment, life is at risk. There are many patients, especially children. However, there are no sanitation facilities in the area, and the people do not know how to prevent the disease, so it is spreading very quickly.</p>
<p>Controlled Fish and Crabs: Kunshan is located near Tai Lake, and Yangcheng River crabs are sold to other places, which is especially important. Because the puppet county government's finances are stretched, it has not only stipulated taxes for crabs, shrimp, and fish but has also recently imposed controls on them to collect money. Therefore, crab prices have recently been very high, with the best ones costing about six or seven jiao per catty, several times more than in previous years. If you want to transport them to other places, you must first pay taxes at the fish market; otherwise, if you are caught, in addition to confiscating the goods, you will also be fined. With such a government, the people are filled with resentment.</p>
<h3>Funing Natural and Man-Made Disasters</h3>
<p>Rascals and Bandits Commit Evil Deeds; Hurricane and Tsunami Arrive Together</p>
<p>Funing Correspondence: Funing is located by the sea. It was lost once last summer. When the Japanese troops retreated, most of the houses were burned down. When merchants and residents returned to the city, they could only temporarily set up thatched huts to do business. This spring, the Japanese troops occupied it again. A group of rascals, including Jiang Song, Zhang Lansheng, and Qian Xiaolaoshu, were used to organize a bogus maintenance association and sent people to find a director of funds to act as the puppet county magistrate. The director, Gu Jishi, had already gone into hiding, and the deputy director, Xiang Shaobai, had also joined a certain army. Jiang had no choice but to collude with bandits such as Zhu Baoyuan to disrupt the townships, raping, burning, and killing, committing all kinds of evil deeds. Although the farmers reluctantly plowed and planted, most of the harvested grain near the villages was robbed. Unfortunately, blessings never come in pairs, and misfortunes never come alone. A hurricane recently passed through, and the coastal areas of the third, sixth, and ninth districts were hit by a tsunami, flooding hundreds of villages and more than 5,000 households of all sizes. No one, whether humans or animals, was spared. According to a recent survey, 13,693 people, including the old, the young, men, and women, were drowned. It is impossible to investigate the number of those from other places. Those who survived have no place to live and no food or clothing. The sound of wailing is unbearable to hear. Now that the Japanese troops have collapsed from Chengkou, they are still coming to the villages from time to time to harass them. The remaining people are hiding everywhere day and night, being startled several times a night. It can be said to be a natural and man-made disaster.</p>

<h3>Special Charity Soccer Match: China United vs. British-French United; Today at 2:30 PM at the Racecourse; Changes in China United's Lineup</h3>
<p>The first special charity soccer match of the season, China United vs. British-French United, will take place today at 2:30 PM at the Racecourse. China United has gathered the elite of the Lido and Donghua teams, while the United team combines the fighters from the Dongse, Lexifoss, and French Merchants Survey teams. With such a concentration of talent, the match is expected to be excellent. A large crowd at the Racecourse is expected. However, there may be temporary changes to China United's lineup. All substitutes must gather in the dressing room at the Racecourse before 2:00 PM today and bring black shorts and blue and white striped socks. The jerseys are white and will be distributed temporarily by the manager, Li Binjun. Sun Jinshun will continue to serve as captain. Tickets are priced at one yuan and six jiao. Except for news reporter passes, which are still valid as usual, all other long-term complimentary tickets are suspended. Referees, linesmen, and player managers must also enter the venue with specially issued tickets; otherwise, they must purchase tickets. The referee is Shen Huichun, and the linesmen are Mike Chetty and Herry. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>China United Team</p>
<p>Qin Bigao (Donghua Club)</p>
<p>Li Yichen, Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Chen Qiguang (Donghua Club), Meng Yiliang (Lido Club), Jiang Zhaoxiang (Lido Club)</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting (Lido Club), Sun Jinshun (Lido Club Captain), Dai Linjing (Donghua Club), Xu Wenkui (Lido Club), Jia Youliang (Donghua Club)</p>
<p>Manager: Li Baojun; New Blood: Wan Xianghua (Donghua), Cai Shengsen (Donghua), Zhang Mingsheng (Lido), Huang Kehou (Lido), Yun Feng (Lido), Wu Qixiang (Lido)</p>
<p>British-French United Team</p>
<p>Bao Saizhong (French Merchants Club) (Captain)</p>
<p>Hailisun, Kelaitu</p>
<p>Maikesigan (Xifosi), Hailisun (Dongsele), Pankerai (French Merchants Club), Kelaitu (French Merchants Club), Xigelun (French Merchants Club)</p>
<p>Tangmusun (Xifosi), Dengken (Xifosi), Saidel (Survey Team), Mainaide (Dongsele), Shifeishi (French Merchants Club)</p>
<p>Manager: Gaxu; New Blood: Ximengsi (Lasike), Jiemuhuater (French Merchants Club), Hui'er (Survey Team)</p>
<p>Discussions on Changes to China United's Lineup: China United and the United team are evenly matched, making it difficult to make a definitive prediction. However, China United's five forwards are perfect, so their offensive power is certainly not comparable to that of the United team, and it will be difficult to counter their attack. Unfortunately, Xu Wenkui's leg injury has healed, but captain Sun Jinshun is injured again, and it is uncertain whether he will be able to play. Li Yichen may be moved forward to fill the position, with Chen Hongguang moved to the back, and Cai Shengsen filling the left forward position. Alternatively, the original lineup may be maintained, with Wu Qixiang joining the forwards. In short, temporary arrangements are still needed. With China United's wealth of talent, even with a few adjustments, it can still be seamless. According to the reporter's observation, Chen Hongguang's performance as a defender in the Donghua vs. Lido match was no less impressive than Li Yichen's. Li Yichen's performance in front of the goal is actually more dangerous than Hongguang's. Therefore, the reporter strongly advocates that the three strong players from Donghua stick to the defense. For this reason, now that Sun Jinshun is likely to be absent, moving Li to the front line and having Hongguang return to his original position is the most appropriate solution. Cai Shengsen is also a strong player in the midfield line and is not inferior to Meng Yiliang. Therefore, whoever plays in the center depends on proper arrangements. If Sun does attend, then I believe the following positions are the most appropriate:</p>
<p>Qin Bigao</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang, Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Cai Shengsen, Li Yichen, Meng Yiliang</p>
<p>Cao Qiuzhe, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang</p>

<h3>First Division Game: Three Wins in Three Matches; Lido Crushes North China Children's Team; Lido Suffers Heavy Casualties and Plays with Nine Men</h3>
<p>First Division Soccer: Lido's match against the North China Children's team yesterday morning took place at the Yitu Ground, drawing 2,000 spectators. After Lido appointed Li Yichen as center back and changed its lineup, its strength doubled. In yesterday's game, it was a completely one-sided situation, winning 5-0. Sun Jinshun and Huang Kehou were injured one after another. For the last 80 minutes, they played with only ten men, and for the last 60 minutes, they played with only nine men, but they still managed to keep a clean sheet and not allow the opponent to score a goal, which is truly commendable. At half-time, the score was 4-0.</p>

Today is the last day. Ms. Tan has many outstanding works on display, which are extremely wonderful. All visitors praised them.</p>
<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>France's War Economic Power and Its Application (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Class English</p>
<p>The Rise of Industrial Productivity</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the rise of France's war power is that the depth of the financial and economic policies of Reynaud was able to take advantage of the instability of international politics and the shakeup of the pound's position, thereby quickly resolving various domestic economic matters and finally getting on the track of development, reversing the past few years of anxiety and deep panic.</p>
<p>The main objective of Reynaud's policy was to induce the "return of fleeing capital." Therefore, he did not hesitate to adopt right-leaning policies, on the one hand reducing fiscal expenditures, and on the other hand ruthlessly increasing working hours. At the same time, he gave broad powers to Daladier to deal with the domestic turmoil. As a result, the anxious French economy was able to return to the path of development.</p>
<p>Judging from the business climate index, it has risen from 83 points in June of last year to 100 points in June of this year (according to S. G. F. survey, taking 1928 as 100%). The industries that have improved particularly well are mining, construction, iron and steel, machinery, and automobile industries. The number of unemployed has decreased from 345,000 in July of last year to 320,000 in the same period this year. The value of export trade has surged from 16.1 billion francs in the first seven months of last year to 20.9 billion francs in the same period this year. Consequently, the excess of imports over exports has decreased from 10.5 billion last year to a little less than 7.8 billion francs this year. As a result, the securities market is very prosperous. Comparing July of this year with the same period last year, the stock index has increased from 207 points to 234 points, and bonds have also risen from 76.5 points to 84.3 points. Even more noteworthy is the sharp increase in the gold reserve of the Bank of France. The reserve at the end of 1934 had fallen to 82.1 billion francs, and by the end of 1937 it had fallen sharply to 59 billion, but by the end of August last year, it had rapidly increased to 97.3 billion francs, exceeding the deposit amount of the past three or four years. From this, it can be seen how rapid and large the return of fleeing capital has been.</p>
<p>Ability to Procure Military Supplies from Abroad</p>
<p>Looking at France's international balance of payments over the years, it can be seen that France's overseas investments and overseas claims, as well as income from reparations, are one of the greatest cornerstones for building France's capitalist imperialism. Although France's foreign trade often has an import surplus, its interest income can often offset two-fifths to four-fifths of it.</p>
<p>The following is a table:</p>
<p>France's International Balance of Payments (Millions of Francs)</p>
<p>1935	 1936	 1937</p>
<p>Income	 6,350	 8,625	 6,705</p>
<p>Shipping, Insurance	 1,400	 1,800	 1,280</p>
<p>Travel Expenses	 750	 1,190	 1,300</p>
<p>Interest Income	 4,000	 5,375	 3,925</p>
<p>Expenditures	 6,750	 12,615	 10,700</p>
<p>Merchandise Import Surplus	 6,000	 11,675	 10,050</p>
<p>Remittances from Overseas Chinese	 750	 940	 650</p>
<p>Excess of Payments	 400	 3,990	 3,995</p>
<p>Visible</p>
<p>Capital Import Surplus	 ——	 600	 2,230</p>
<p>Gold Outflow	 ——	 29,500	 ——</p>
<p>This huge amount of funds possessed by France is usually a heavy burden on its socio-economic order. Because of its floating and instability, it often causes disturbances in finance. But in wartime, for France, which is poor in domestic resources, it is the most powerful condition for procuring overseas military supplies. According to the recent public announcement by Finance Minister Reynaud, France's gold holdings have reached a huge amount of 5,000 tons. Therefore, he is very optimistic about the prospects of a long-term war. His statement is as follows:</p>
<p>"France has a huge amount of gold to support a long-term war, which is more than enough. The Bank of France has about 2,500 tons in its treasury, and the Exchange Equalization Fund also has 500 tons. In addition, the funds deposited by French people abroad are between 700 billion and 1,000 billion francs, equivalent to about 2,000 tons of gold. The above totals 5,000 tons of gold, and the amount held by the people domestically has not yet been calculated.</p>
<p>"If necessary in the future, France can still obtain credit loans from foreign private individuals or governments. Regarding this, the financial agreement signed between Britain and France is sufficient to supplement the military and diplomatic alliances between the two countries.</p>
<p>"I recall that during the last European war, from 1914 to 1919, France's foreign trade, after offsetting imports and exports, lost an average of 13 billion francs per year. The total amount in five years was 65 billion francs. Among them, after deducting 8 billion for merchant shipping freight and insurance, 13 billion for foreign securities held by the French people, and 16 billion for the expenses of the Allied forces in France, totaling 37 billion francs, there was a deficit of 28 billion francs, an average annual deficit of slightly less than 6 billion francs. At the exchange rate at that time, 1,600 tons of gold were lost each year. Considering France's current resources, the prospects for a long-term war are indeed optimistic."</p>
<p>Formation of Wartime Economic System</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, Britain repeatedly issued various emergency economic decrees, transforming the pre-war liberal economic organization and entering a strongly controlled wartime economic system. However, France was slower, and the market was not as tense as in London. However, the Lyon silk exchange once suspended trading on September 6; the foreign exchange and stock markets still operated as usual. General financial institutions also did not suspend business; the state still allowed them to be free and did not interfere.</p>
<p>Although the response of the French economy was not as profound as that of Britain, the Daladier government's deliberate calmness also contributed to this. The key to the success of Reynaud's financial and economic policies was, in a nutshell, to restore and maintain market order and to make fleeing capital return to the country. However, the returning funds have not been fully digested by the production sector; if the market wavers even slightly, there is still a danger of rushing to escape. The outbreak of the European war was a very serious situation. If Reynaud had immediately intervened extensively, it would have been enough to increase people's panic. This is why Daladier deliberately remained calm and why international trains resumed operation. The resumption of international trains stabilized market psychology. Once people's minds were settled, changing the economic structure would achieve the effect of guiding the situation. Therefore, the French government's emergency financial decrees, implementing exchange controls and interfering with gold trading, were not at the beginning of the outbreak of the war, but after the resumption of international train services on September 9, which is of profound significance.</p>
<p>Recalling the beginning of the alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union, the French government convened an emergency meeting on August 23, and immediately decided on more than ten important plans, the main ones being to conscript 600,000 reserve soldiers, to recognize and implement various military decrees to deal with the final stage of the peace, and to grant independent power to Daladier. The next day, it promulgated a wartime requisition order, and immediately requisitioned city cars for military use; then, on the one hand, it cut off the railway between Germany and France, and on the other hand, it implemented a requisition order for the national railway. On the same day, it implemented restrictions on the use of metal products. On August 28 and September 1, it issued import and export prohibition decrees. On September 2, both houses of parliament unanimously passed a wartime emergency budget of 69 billion francs, and at the same time abolished the Bank of France's regulations on maintaining a 35% cash or foreign exchange reserve rate for issuance. On the 4th, it implemented the nationalization of gold policy. It extended military working hours to 72 hours per week. On the 9th, it promulgated emergency financial decrees. On the 10th, it prohibited soy sauce exports, managed foreign exchange transactions, and prohibited gold trading. Later, it successively promulgated bills such as "limiting profits" and "controlling prices." It can be seen that Reynaud had already formed a plan for the construction of the wartime economic system and was already gradually implementing it. (End)</p>
<h3>The Past Week</h3>
<p>The exchange rate suddenly turned back to contraction, and finally loosened again. It is said that the reason for the "contraction" was stimulated by the "Japanese puppet regime's prohibition of the import and export of legal tender." The reason for the relaxation is that the customs authorities and the diplomatic corps and foreign merchants stationed in Shanghai firmly refused and protested. This statement seems reasonable. In fact, it is nothing more than speculators having an excuse to take advantage of the situation and stir up trouble for their own benefit. The depreciation of legal tender on the black market was too excessive, and the price of foreign goods rose to the point where importers were idle. This is the fundamental reason for the past prolonged relaxation. The outbreak of the European war, the return of funds from overseas Chinese, the floating of export bills, and the large households rushing to sell at low prices are the triggers for the continued relaxation. There is no end to the relaxation, and speculators are suffering from the lack of opportunities. The Japanese puppet regime is jealous. Therefore, one, although knowing it is ineffective, still takes action; the other, although knowing it is ineffective, also takes the opportunity to disrupt. Ineffectiveness is ultimately ineffectiveness, and the result is still relaxation. "Relaxation" has a solid foundation, and "contraction" is just a method of grasping at shadows. The question is only when can it be "relaxed and stable"?</p>
<p>— Wang Siwei</p>
<p>The cost of living index for workers in this city in October decreased by 12.36% compared to September. The common people have therefore received a lot of comfort. But if you study it carefully, only fuel and food have decreased. Clothing and miscellaneous items are still rising. In today's colder weather, clothing merchants can indeed take advantage of the situation. But the facts show that high prices are of course unfavorable to the lives of ordinary people; they are also not good for industry and commerce themselves, and will only make the market decline day by day. In the current environment in Shanghai, it is impossible to revive and develop industry and commerce; but it is also urgently needed to be able to stabilize it. Therefore, the current problem lies in stabilizing prices. At this time, on the one hand, we pray that the various trade associations will organize price stabilization committees to curb speculation and manipulation, and do our best to dredge the sources; on the other hand, we hope that the people will automatically save and use more domestic products. However, we should strictly oppose the conspiracies that borrow the beautiful names of "price limits" or "storing grain to prevent famine" to implement the reality of "stimulating the market" and "facilitating price increases." At present, there is only one way to ensure the livelihood of the common people. One is to ask the impartial concession authorities to handle "price stabilization" and "storage"; the other is for citizens to unite and implement consumer cooperation, and first organize it between employers and employees of commercial firms and factories.</p>

<p>It is said that the National Government is preparing to allocate 50 million yuan to implement factory bombing insurance. This is a decision of the Senate. For a country, it is an urgent matter to implement bombing insurance during wartime. Everyone knows that in modern warfare, economic weapons are even more important. Destroying one more factory will cause the country to lose more strength in terms of strength. Therefore, during the war, the country should do its best to protect factories. In the past, although factories were in dangerous areas, they could not insure against bombing with insurance companies, because the private insurance companies would not do this loss-making business. Therefore, after being bombed, only the factory owners suffered losses alone, and indirectly affected the country's wartime industry. Now, if the government runs factory bombing insurance, any factory can receive compensation immediately after being bombed by Japanese aircraft, and rebuild or repair the factory, so that it can be restored to its original state in a short period of time. This not only protects the factory owner from losses, but also indirectly maintains the country's wartime strength. Therefore, we earnestly hope that factory bombing insurance can be realized in an instant.</p>

<p>Mitsui &amp; Co.'s recent rush to buy eggs has its own reason for disregarding its image: this is due to the lack of food and nutrition on the Japanese front lines, which has greatly damaged morale. Mitsui is just acting on orders. But what is the use of "grabbing"? Eggs are laid by hens. Only because the Japanese army eats chickens wherever they see them in the occupied areas, there is an egg shortage. This is even worse than killing chickens to get eggs. In fact, the reason for the egg shortage is not the only one. The famine of pork, beef, grains, cotton, silk, etc. is also the same reason. If Japanese financial groups want to plunder the Chinese market and raw materials, they will support the warlords' armed invasion of China. As a result, the Chinese market becomes poorer and the supply of Chinese raw materials decreases. Contrary to their wishes, they want to rely on the "control" method to carry out aggressive plunder; as a result, the production in the occupied areas declines and the purchasing power withers. Because the Chinese army cares for the people's difficulties, it has not fully implemented the "scorched earth" policy. These actions by the Japanese puppet regime will not help us complete the purpose of "scorched earth". Retribution will not be far away.</p>

<h3>China's Economy Since the Outbreak of the European War</h3>
<p>— Yu Xielin</p>
<p>The impact of the European war on China's economy has been very beneficial, as can be seen from the facts of the past month. People should now stop making unconscious speculations and discuss the impact of the European war on China and the future trends based on reality. The following is a detailed analysis of the impact of the European war on China's economy over the past month:</p>
<p>(1) Favorable Foreign Trade China has a vast territory and abundant resources. Although it has lost a lot of land, the free areas still have endless treasures. China is particularly endowed with important products such as tung oil, pig bristles, and Pu, etc. Although transportation is inconvenient and transportation is difficult, the export of these products has increased year by year, and has now become the pillar of the war of resistance economy. The United States has always been the main customer of tung oil. Although the European war has broken out, it has not reduced its exports; the same is true for other special products. Because the European war has broken out, overseas consumption has greatly increased, which is enough to increase the export volume of these products. Therefore, it is heard that the exports from the free areas in September have also increased.</p>
<p>In the occupied areas, there was a surprising import surplus in the first eight months of this year, but since the outbreak of the European war, Shanghai, which is famous for its import surplus, has also become an export surplus. This shows that the world's countries are in urgent need of Chinese raw materials, fearing that the supply will be insufficient. Therefore, the future of China's foreign trade is very optimistic.</p>
<p>The following is a discussion centered on Shanghai's trade.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the trade between Britain, France, and Germany and China has been greatly affected due to shipping relations. Shanghai's import trade in September has therefore decreased sharply, and exports have increased greatly due to the increase in US sales. Therefore, the Shanghai Customs has become an export surplus again. The export surplus reached a huge amount of 1,719,000 yuan in legal tender, which is a phenomenon of improvement in China's economy.</p>
<p>Among the exported native products, the export of textiles has increased significantly, reaching a huge amount of more than 19 million yuan, accounting for the top spot in exported goods. Piece goods, yarn textiles, and knitted goods, as well as other textiles, also have a huge export volume, totaling more than 20 million yuan. In terms of raw materials, animal and animal products also have an export volume of more than 10 million yuan, and minerals, metals, and miscellaneous grains and tea also have a large export volume. It can be seen that during the European war, what the world's countries rely on from our country is not limited to raw materials. And light industrial manufactured products are also among them. In Shanghai's exports, light industrial manufactured products have reached more than half of the total export volume.</p>
<p>In terms of country, Shanghai's foreign trade situation is the United States in the first place. Shanghai's exports to the United States in September were more than 20 million yuan. In terms of imports, Japan is second, followed by Britain and Germany. In terms of exports, Hong Kong is second, followed by Britain, and then French Annam.</p>
<p>The total export volume of Shanghai Port in September reached more than 66 million yuan. If the whole country is considered, the number is even greater. Such a huge number is probably an impossible dream for pessimists. This time, China can still export such a large amount during the war of resistance, which shows that China's productivity has unlimited development prospects.</p>
<p>(2) High Exchange Rate Since the outbreak of the European war, it has been more than a month, and the foreign exchange price in Shanghai's black market has continued to rise. Since August, the price of three and a half pence has risen to more than five pence, and the US exchange rate has risen from 6.25 yuan in August to 8 yuan now. This is indeed a good phenomenon during the war of resistance. Looking back at Japan, the exchange rate of the US dollar fell by 10% at the outbreak of the European war. Why can our country rise by 25% at this time? Studying the results, we have obtained the following factors.</p>
<p>In the past, speculators believed that the future of legal tender was pessimistic, so they scrambled to buy foreign exchange, which caused the exchange rate of legal tender to fall from 8 pence to 3.5 pence in three months. This time, the European war broke out. People generally have an uneasy psychology about the British exchange, so they threw out the British exchange. They all thought that the US exchange was safe, and some also improved the US exchange, but they were very sensitive. However, the price of legal tender in the New York market gradually increased, so the US exchange in the Shanghai black market also rose. Recently, due to the story of Xiangbei, the foreign exchange black market has risen even higher. Therefore, speculators have gradually become disheartened about foreign exchange and spit out foreign exchange violently, thus creating the highest price in three months.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, exports have increased sharply, and Shanghai has had an export surplus of more than 10 million yuan in September, so the supply of foreign exchange in the black market has also increased a lot.</p>
<p>Recently, the Hong Kong gang's violent dumping in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market is also the main reason for the increase in foreign exchange. Since Hong Kong promulgated the foreign exchange control order, all commercial activities have been restricted, so they have flocked to Shanghai. During this European war, although it still does not have the ability to attract a large amount of fleeing capital to China, the inflow of overseas funds cannot be said to be non-existent.</p>
<p>From the above facts, it can be seen that China is in an absolutely advantageous position during the European war. The increase in exports is enough to promote the revival of China's economy, and it can obtain a large amount of military supplies to strengthen the front-line combat power. The high exchange rate is enough to increase the credit of legal tender. It can be seen from these two that the Japanese's coastal blockade, destruction and occupation of China's national industry, and the policy of obtaining foreign exchange to make legal tender collapse are only in vain.</p>

<h3>Silk Tea October New York Raw Silk Consumption Increased Sharply</h3>
<p>This year's silk market has seen a rapid rise due to the impact of rising prices of various commodities. The highest record for Yokohama spot in October was 1960 yuan, jumping out of the previous month's highest price of nearly 300 yuan, more than doubled the highest price of 840 yuan in the same month last year. The reasons for this have been mentioned in this publication from time to time, and the most important one is the outbreak of the European war in the world, and the destruction of the inherent production order due to the war in the Far East. In this evolution, production has shrunk, prices have soared, and speculation has risen. Some commodities have thus created an unprecedented boom, which is not limited to raw silk. The statistics of New York silk in October show that progress has been made in various items of inventory, sales, and imports, which proves that the price of New York silk still has a practical basis. The import volume in New York in October increased by 10,464 dan, sales increased by 4,989 dan, and inventory increased by 8,175 dan. This month, Shanghai silk imports increased by 458 packages, and Guangdong silk increased by 20 dan. The statistics are recorded on the left (unit: dan),</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the Fall of Shanghai Today: All Circles Further Encourage and Inspire Themselves; The Painful Impression of This Day Two Years Ago Has Not Faded; The People's Beliefs Will Never Change</h3>
<p>Today (the 13th) is the second anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai. All circles in this city are solemnly commemorating it, but without lowering the flag. According to what happened the morning of November 10th two years ago, after the Japanese troops landed in Pudong, they contacted the Japanese troops in Puxi and surrounded Nanshi. Although the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River were blocked north of the blockade line, they frequently fired artillery shells toward Nanshi to assist in the attack. Japanese aircraft in the sky also continuously dropped bombs. The Chinese troops only retreated at 4 p.m. on the 13th. After the Japanese troops entered, the prosperous areas of Nanshi were completely enveloped in fire, with flames soaring into the sky, resembling a fiery hell. Thousands of city houses were tragically destroyed, and the losses were incalculable. The Japanese side is very concerned that the mobile Chinese troops in the suburbs will launch attacks to demonstrate on this anniversary, so various places are carrying out anxious preparations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Sea of Ruins, a White Void</p>
<p>This month's 13th is the second anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai, which is also the last day the isolated army held Nanshi. The prosperous areas inside and outside the Nanshi city walls along the towns on the Pudong coast turned into rubble in three days of fire. Moreover, in the occupied areas, even bricks and tiles are being controlled, and recently, even intact houses have been dismantled and sold after the great fire, resulting in tens of thousands of ruins and a white void. The semi-refugee-like people in the Nanshi area recalled the scene of abandoning their homes and belongings, supporting the old and carrying the young, and taking refuge in refugee areas two years ago. Comparing their current miserable state with the era of peaceful and prosperous life, they cannot help but feel extremely sorrowful.</p>
<p>Special Precautions Implemented in the Suburbs</p>
<p>The Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai are deeply concerned about a possible surprise attack by the Chinese troops, so they plan to station troops one by one in all important land and water areas in the suburbs of Shanghai, and assign large units of Japanese and puppet troops to patrol in designated areas. All pedestrians, vehicles, and ships will be subject to strict inspection. Every Japanese and puppet soldier has a bayonet on their rifle, and they sometimes aim with loaded guns, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p>
<p>Strict Searches in Hongkou and Other Areas</p>
<p>Along the bridges north of the Suzhou River, in areas guarded by Japanese troops, the number of Japanese soldiers increased from two to four yesterday morning, and to five or six in the afternoon. In addition, the Japanese Consulate has added two special policemen to each bridge. In addition to strictly checking pedestrians' passes, they are also subjected to thorough body searches. Anyone who does not comply is immediately detained and questioned. The procedures for searching pedestrians at the Waibaidu Bridge, Zha Pu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge are particularly harsh. Although there are no Japanese troops stationed on the roads in Hongkou, there are many car patrols and army patrols coming and going. These precautions will continue to be implemented today.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Hastily Adding Fortifications</p>
<p>Since the situation in the suburbs of Shanghai became tense, the Japanese troops have been extremely panicked, easily alarmed, and frightened several times a day. Starting the day before yesterday, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers at the railway crossing on Hongqiao Road dismantled the sand fort and rebuilt it, using cement and aggregate as the base and red bricks for the walls. By yesterday morning, it had been built two or three feet high. Their working condition was very hasty, and their anxious state was constantly revealed. A few bungalows to the west and south have been used as puppet police stations.</p>
<h3>Those Who Host Guests for Pro-Japanese Individuals Must Report It; Police Department Has Ordered Wanli to Suspend Business for One Week Due to the Bloodshed Case</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, after two members of the "Self-Defense Corps" in the Western District were assassinated at Wanli Restaurant, 514 Fuzhou Road, on Thursday night of last week, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has ordered the restaurant to suspend business for one week starting yesterday (the 11th). It has been learned that the Police Department had previously issued a notice to all restaurants in the Public Concession that if Japanese or pro-Japanese individuals hold banquets at the restaurants, the restaurants should report to the police authorities. Upon receiving the report, the Police Department will send special detectives to the restaurant to prevent accidents. The Police Department believes that Wanli Restaurant did not comply with this order, so it ordered the suspension of business for one week yesterday as a warning. According to reports, there have been shootings in restaurants such as Guanshengyuan in recent weeks.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia Remit Money Back to China</h3>
<p>Totaling Approximately 20 Million Yuan in July and August Alone</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia have significantly increased their remittances back to China, breaking all previous records. According to the amount of remittances to Quanzhou and Yongchun counties in July and August, the amount of remittances is equal to the total amount of remittances in the past five months. The amount was 4 million yuan per month in the past, and the total amount for five months was about 20 million yuan. The amounts for July and August were about 10 million yuan each, more than two and a half times the usual amount, which is a rare good phenomenon in history and greatly benefits the war of resistance economy.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Border: The Puppet Side Raises a Counterproposal; In addition to Police Power, There Are Other Requirements; Detailed Content to Be Kept Secret by Both Parties</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute over road construction beyond the border in Puxi between the Shanghai Public Concession's工部局(gōng bù jú/Municipal Council) and the puppet municipal government, Mr. Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, and Mr. Phillips, the Director-General and Chief Executive, visited the puppet mayor Chuan Xiaonan on the 2nd of this month and made suggestions. At that time, Chuan stated that he would give it serious consideration. It is now learned that Chuan returned to visit Mr. Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, at 5:30 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 11th) and handed over a counterproposal from the puppet municipal government regarding the suggestions of the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council is currently unwilling to disclose the content. It is understood that Fessenden and Chuan Xiaonan had agreed during their last meeting to strictly keep the content of the suggestions and counterproposals secret until a hypothetical agreement is reached by both parties, at which time it can be announced. Therefore, the Municipal Council is maintaining a firm attitude of silence regarding the proposed suggestions and the content of the puppet side's counterproposal. An official from the Municipal Council also stated that he cannot comment on the counterproposal raised by Chuan at this time. However, the Municipal Council has decided to study the puppet side's proposal starting today and then reopen negotiations.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Officials Have Not Leaked Information</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, Chuan Xiaonan, the "Mayor" of the regime under the wing of the Japanese side in this city, raised several counterproposals to the Municipal Council last night (the 11th) in the hope of resolving the dispute over road construction beyond the border related to the "Great Way" police patrolling the main roads of the Western District. A reporter recently asked a senior official of the Municipal Council about the nature of the counterproposals. The response was that, given his position, he cannot disclose the nature of Mayor Chuan's suggestions at this time. It is said that officials of the Municipal Council decided during their last conversation with Chuan that disclosing any information about the suggestions and counterproposals of both sides would be detrimental to the negotiations. Therefore, they decided not to disclose such information until a satisfactory agreement has been商得試騐(shāng de shì yàn/negotiated and tested). Last night, it was heard that Municipal Council officials would begin studying Chuan's counterproposals next week. According to the North China Daily News, Chuan Xiaonan visited Mr. Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, at 5:30 p.m. yesterday and handed over his counterproposals.</p>
<p>Puppet Police in Puxi Tolerate Robbery</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, at 8 p.m. on Friday, a British woman had just gotten off a public bus on Yuyuan Road and was walking west on Dingpan Road when she was about to enter an alley to her residence. Suddenly, a Chinese man snatched her handbag from behind and ran off to a nearby alley on Yuyuan Road. The British woman immediately shouted for the police to chase him and reported to two armed Chinese policemen in制廢(zhì fèi/uniforms) of the "Special Municipal Government" nearby. It is said that the two Chinese policemen did not provide any assistance and seemed unaware that the British woman was calling for their help. Therefore, the robber easily escaped into the "Special Municipal Government" area south of Yuyuan Road and has not been caught as of yesterday (the 11th).</p>
<h3>The New Jiangnan Steamer Almost Caused a Major Disaster</h3>
<p>The German-owned Xin Jiangnan steamer loaded passengers and cargo from Ligang outside Zhenhai Port on the 2nd of this month. Because the ship was very small, it encountered wind in the Tongsha waters outside Wusong Port. All six tugboats broke their cables and drifted away, almost causing an accident. Therefore, the ship will no longer sail to Ligang after returning to Shanghai and has now changed to the Beisha line.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Commemorated the Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth: Citizens Were Extremely Excited; The War of Resistance Has Entered a Favorable Stage; The Blue Sky with a White Sun Emblem Was Everywhere</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th) was the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. Although there was no commemorative ceremony in this port due to the special environment, the citizens reminisced about the founding achievements of the late Sun Yat-sen. At a time when the War of Resistance has entered a favorable stage and national liberation is in sight, they were particularly excited. Yesterday, the solemn and glorious 青白國微(qīng bái guó wēi/Blue Sky with a White Sun emblem) fluttered in the wind on the streets and rooftops, and was everywhere. The citizens' love for the country and their firm emotions to work hard to complete the great cause of resistance and construction and carry forward Sun Yat-sen's遺敎(yí jiào/testament) were evident everywhere. All circles spent this festive day in a solemn and calm宅氣(zhái qì/atmosphere), with everyone taking their efforts in their own positions as a commemoration of the birth of the Founding Father. Details of the various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Blue Sky with a White Sun Emblem Flew Throughout the City</p>
<p>Starting yesterday morning, all stores and residents in the two concessions uniformly hung the 青天白日滿地紅(qīng tiān bái rì mǎn dì hóng/Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth) national flag, fluttering in the wind, creating a new atmosphere. The citizens' patriotic emotions arose spontaneously. The reporter passed 爱麦虞限路(ài mài yú xiàn lù/Avenue Edward VII) yesterday morning and saw many painted national flags posted on the walls and telephone poles along the road, which were obviously the work of elementary school students. Although the skills were childish, the feelings of those who saw them were even more excited. Yesterday was a Sunday. Except for the Municipal Council and various银钱业(yín qián yè/banking) firms, which will take a day off today as usual, the four major banks, including the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, will be open as usual. The post office, customs, courts, and schools will also not take a day off.</p>
<p>The Precautions Were Not Tense</p>
<p>Yesterday, the authorities of the two concessions, in addition to increasing the number of Chinese and foreign detectives patrolling the streets and searching suspicious pedestrians and vehicles, the bridges over the Suzhou River were unobstructed. The general situation was no different from the past. On roads such as 福履理路(fú lǚ lǐ lù/Ferry Road), 拉都路(lā dū lù/Route Doumer), and霞飞路(xiá fēi lù/Avenue Joffre), slogans and leaflets such as "Support the National Government" and national flags were distributed, but no disturbances occurred. The precautionary measures in the area of road construction beyond the border in Puxi were also no different from the past. The Japanese and puppet sides implemented special precautions in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The First District of Hebei Silently Celebrated</p>
<p>The first district of Hebei, north of the Suzhou River, has been劃入(huà rù/included) in the Japanese military警備(jǐng bèi/garrison) area. Under the low pressure, the stores and residents along 北江西路(běi jiāng xī lù/North Jiangxi Road) did not hang flags. The citizens silently commemorated this day, but remotely looked at the flags flying in河南(hé nán/south of the river), and deeply felt that the scene was completely different across the river. The Japanese troops stationed at the缺口(quē kǒu/gap) of 北江西路(běi jiāng xī lù/North Jiangxi Road) were extremely strict in checking pedestrians entering Hongkou. The night before, they also mobilized to 北河南路(běi hé nán lù/North Henan Road)东段(dōng duàn/east section) for deployment. A police 警備(jǐng bèi/garrison) vehicle and many detectives from the police station were stationed west of the 北江西路(běi jiāng xī lù/North Jiangxi Road) 文監師路(wén jiān shī lù/Wenshi Road)缺口(quē kǒu/gap) to carry out precautions.</p>
<h3>Issuance of National Conscription Certificates; Establishment of Checkpoints</h3>
<p>Any Man of Age Without a Certificate Will Be Sentenced to Detention and Forced into Military Service</p>
<p>In order to improve military service, the Ministry of Military Affairs will issue national conscription certificates, which will be implemented starting next year. Starting February 1st, checkpoints will be set up on important transportation routes. Any man of age without a national conscription certificate will be sentenced to one day of detention. Starting April 1st, any troops or organizations may forcibly recruit into military service any person who still does not have a national conscription certificate, at any time and any place.</p>
<h3>Promoting National Construction Savings Bonds; Establishment of a Committee; All Post Offices Nationwide Have Been Ordered to Open; And Special Agreements Have Been Made with Various Banks to Act as Issuing Agents</h3>
<p>After the Postal Remittances and Exchange Bureau was ordered to issue frugality-based national construction savings bonds, it first sold them in Chongqing on October 10 this year, with remarkable results. In addition, Kunming, Guiyang, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and other important towns, as well as Zhejiang, Hunan, Min, Yue, Gui, Gan, and other provinces, and more than 1,000 post offices across the country are successively 　行(xíng/implementing). These savings bonds are the responsibility of China Post, and the National Government guarantees</p>
<p>Generous Interest</p>
<p>Convenient Procedures. The purpose of its issuance is to encourage people to save and assist government construction. At the same time, in order to facilitate patriotic overseas Chinese to purchase bonds, special agreements have been made with the Overseas Chinese Shanghai and other banks in Hong Kong to act as issuing agents. The government, considering that this is a major plan for national construction, has specially established the National Frugality and National Construction Savings Movement Committee General Assembly, with the Central Propaganda Minister 叶楚傖(yè chǔ cāng) as the</p>

<h3>British Naval Tug Leaves Shanghai to Return Home</h3>
<p>Already Sold and Now Re-Leased; May Need to Sail to India Midway</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, the sea-going tugboat "Suisey", which is responsible for rescue work, weighs 579 tons and is 155 feet long. It was built by the British Admiralty in 1918 and sold to a company in Shanghai after the war. Now it has been re-leased by the British Admiralty and left Shanghai last Sunday, taking the Suez Canal to England. The entire journey will take ten weeks, but it may not sail to England and be recalled to India to engage in</p>
<p>Special Work</p>
<p>The current captain of the ship is Mr. Searle, a British man who has been coming and going on the Chinese coast for a long time. Another British man on board is the chief engineer, Mr. Lloyd. Both of them used to belong to Jardine Matheson. The crew members are Chinese recruited in Shanghai. It is expected that after they arrive in England, they will be sent back to China. The "Suisey" has sailed long distances. In addition to coming to Shanghai from England after the war, it sailed from Shanghai to the west coast of Australia in 1936, only stopping at Samarinda to add fuel and drinking water.</p>
<p>On the Way Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>The "Menduro"轮(lún/steamer) was towed along. Although it encountered bad weather repeatedly, no accident occurred. It is also said that another tugboat built by the British Admiralty, the "St. Bloke," will also 起椗(qǐ dìng/weigh anchor) to England in a few days. The statement that the "St. Bloke" is actually the "Caroline Moller" wheel of the Moller company has been denied by a British Admiralty officer stationed in Shanghai. It is said that the tugboat participated in British naval exercises in Weihaiwei this summer, and its name is also "St. Bloke." According to reports, the wheel was built in China in 1920 and is 135 feet long.</p>

<h3>Jianghai Customs Inspects Parcels</h3>
<p>Additional Tax Police Assigned to Various Wharves to Strictly Inspect Inbound and Outbound Cargo Parcels</p>
<p>After Jianghai Customs was forced to change hands due to environmental factors, the Commissioner of Customs, Mr. Rosford, has never slackened his efforts in anti-smuggling work. He has repeatedly ordered his subordinates to step up their work and reward informants, and improved the procedures for transit or import and export declarations, and allowed domestic goods shipped by other routes to be transferred to foreign countries or other places. Now, the Customs has assigned additional tax police to perform duties at various wharves. Every time cargo arrives from other ports, it must be carefully inspected and tax bills presented. Those who do not comply will be detained, confiscated, and confiscated. The Customs dispatches tax police to the post office every day to inspect all mail packages sent from Shanghai to other ports and establishes a post office office. Its office hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. All personal and commercial packages must be opened for inspection before they can be sent. Mail packages sent from other ports to Shanghai are also subject to the same inspection.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada, Passes Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>Held Talks with Gasser</p>
<p>The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada Renzo, arrived in Shanghai by wheel the day before yesterday. At that time, Japanese senior officials such as Japanese envoy to China Kato welcomed him at the dock. After Sawada arrived, he stayed at the Broadway Building in Hongkou and had a lengthy conversation with Kato, which lasted about two hours. The contents are unknown. It is learned that Sawada took the Japanese wheel Hazel name丸(wán/round) yesterday afternoon to leave Shanghai for France　 任(rèn/appointment).</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest on Matured British Gold Bonds Have Been Deposited into a Special Account; The Eleventh Principal Repayment of 69,000 Pounds Sterling; Principal and Interest Have Been Delivered to HSBC Bank for Collection and Payment</h3>
<p>In order to complete the supplementary construction fund for the Yuehan Railway, the National Government issued British Gold Bonds of 6% interest in June of the Republic of China year twenty three (1934) by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the Ministry of Railways, totaling 1.5 million pounds sterling. At that time, it was issued at 96% of the face value. It was stipulated that principal and interest would begin to be drawn for repayment every six months starting January 1st of the Republic of China year twenty four (1935), in twenty-five installments, until January 1st of the Republic of China year thirty six (1947), when the principal and interest would be paid in full. It was designated that the funds borrowed by the Ministry of Railways from the British return of the Boxer Indemnity would be used as the fund. These bonds were underwritten by HSBC Bank and others. The eleventh drawing will be held at the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger in Shanghai on December 1st. A total of 69,000 pounds sterling will be repaid. It is scheduled to be paid by the four banks, including the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and HSBC, on January 1st of next year. It is heard that the principal and interest due for the eleventh repayment have been allocated by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications and delivered to the British HSBC Bank and others, and deposited into the account of the Committee for the Custody of the Remaining British Gold Boxer Indemnity Bonds, for special storage and payment. This is sufficient proof that the Chinese government's commitment to maintaining credit has remained unchanged, which has won the trust of bondholders at home and abroad, and the prices of Chinese government bonds in domestic and foreign securities markets have rebounded.</p>
<h3>Jews in Shanghai Mourn Their Persecuted Compatriots</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, after Ernst vom Rath, the Secretary of the German Embassy in Paris, was assassinated by a Jewish youth last year, the most violent anti-Jewish riots in the history of the Third Reich occurred on November 10. There are many German Jews who have been killed. The Jews who have taken refuge in Shanghai began to mourn these Jews who died in Germany starting this month of the 10th, for a period of three days. It will end with a special memorial ceremony held at the synagogue today (the 12th).</p>
<h3>Soliciting Cold Weather Clothing Donations; Second General Mobilization Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Cold Weather Clothing Solicitation Association stipulates that 3 million cotton vests will be solicited this year and distributed to soldiers and refugees. Due to the special environment in Shanghai, it has been changed to soliciting 200,000 yuan for cold weather clothing donations. Since its implementation, all sectors of industry, commerce, and culture have enthusiastically participated, and the results have been very good. By the end of last month, it was close to the quota. Later, the Solicitation Association notified that the national cold weather clothing solicitation would be extended to the end of November this year, and the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth was designated as the second general mobilization solicitation after National Day. All circles in this city continued to donate as much as possible, in order to achieve the goal of doubling the donation at the end of this month. Yesterday was the date of the general mobilization on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, and the promotion in all circles was even more enthusiastic. It is expected that the donation results in the next 18 days will be even more considerable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Elementary School Teacher Poisoned in Hongkou</h3>
<p>Severe Vomiting and Diarrhea</p>
<p>Guan Kou Jianji, Jia Teng Jiangying, and other seven teachers who were receiving training at the Japanese Elementary School Teacher Training Center established by the Japanese side at the Tongwen College in Xujiahui went to the Japanese 休餐室(xiū cān shì/rest room) on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou for dinner at noon the day before yesterday (the 10th). Unexpectedly, they were poisoned and vomited severely. The Japanese side is very　注意(zhù yì/concerned) about this. Guan Kou and others are still being treated in a hospital in Puxi.</p>
<h3>Attitudes of Various Countries Turn Stronger; Kato Achieved Nothing; England, France, and the United States Have No Possibility of Accepting and Recognizing the New Regime; Resolution of the Road Construction Beyond the Border Issue May Be Expected</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, since Japanese envoy Kato arrived in Shanghai, he has been conducting continuous inquiries with the authorities of England, the United States, and France, taking the maintenance of the interests of various countries in China as an exchange condition, and asking whether the various countries have the possibility of recognizing the puppet "New Regime." It is heard that the authorities of the countries believe that this matter is of great importance and that all negotiations should be handled by their respective governments and cannot be resolved locally, and have politely declined. The Far Eastern policies of the aforementioned countries have not only remained unchanged recently, but have also gradually become tougher. They will naturally not accept any conditions for this new regime that cannot be recognized internationally. Also, regarding the issue of road construction beyond the border, it is generally believed that a temporary agreement can be reached to avoid friction, and that the fundamental solution must be handled by a legally legitimate government that is internationally recognized.</p>
<h3>Record of Lang Jing-shan's Photography Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Fang Feng</p>
<p>If you first admire Mr. Lang Jing-shan's photography and then meet the man himself, you will inevitably feel quite surprised.</p>
<p>Mr. Lang Jing-shan has the gentle demeanor of a Confucian scholar, is very reserved in his manner, speaks with order and reason, and dresses in an old-fashioned style. Even his every move does not resemble that of a city dweller. You might think he is a scholar, a university lecturer, and you would never know that he possesses such skill and lofty artistic conception in photography. However, Jing-shan's accomplishments in photography are not accidental. He has accumulated many years of experience, coupled with continuous effort, and maintains constant contact with photography circles in Europe and America. This allows him to keep pace with the times and achieve his present success. Last month, when Aurora University commemorated the centenary of the invention of photography by Daguerre, it held a photography exhibition. Mr. Ferguson said that we should not commemorate Daguerre in an empty and superficial way. We should follow Daguerre's spirit—that is, emulate his spirit of painstaking research. Mr. Ferguson also said that a person like Lang Jing-shan truly possesses the spirit of Daguerre.</p>
<p>Jing-shan regards photography as an art form, seeking artistic interest beyond the rigid function of recording images. He transforms the mechanical into the artistic. He is able to convey the artistic conception of Eastern art onto photography, causing people to have a wonderful and direct intuition when they see it. We often say, "There is poetry in painting, and painting in poetry." This means that painting can evoke the flavor of poetry, and writing poetry can evoke the realm of painting. This kind of skill can only be achieved by famous artists. However, the "both poetry and painting" artistic interest on a small piece of paper can only be found in Jing-shan's photographic works, which possess this style.</p>
<p>Today, Jing-shan is publicly exhibiting his works from his recent tour of the Southwest in the art gallery on the fourth floor of the Da Xin Company. All proceeds from the ticket sales will be used to help refugees. Local English newspapers, such as the North China Daily News, the China Press, and the Shanghai Times, have all published two-page special supplements dedicated to Lang's works. This is an honor for Chinese photographers and is worthy of great praise.</p>
<p>Yesterday at dusk, the author, along with Xu Ze-ren, Zhang Ruo-gu, and Hu Dao-jing, met with Jing-shan in a quiet room in western Shanghai and had the opportunity to preview the exhibits for today.</p>
<p>It was truly dazzling and hard to put down. We felt as if we had taken a trip to Sichuan. Among these many works, we saw the sea of clouds on the summit of Mount Emei, like flying catkins and seawater, with precipitous cliffs that were breathtaking. The uniqueness and beauty of Mount Emei are different from those of Mount Huang. We also saw the Chongqing Beibei Hot Springs, where Chairman Lin appeared to be floating like an immortal in front of the Milk Flower Cave. The background was the hot springs, like mist and smoke, reflecting the vines hanging from the cliff stones, which were quite antique. As we looked at the paintings, we listened to Jing-shan's narration. At the same time, we also boated on the Jialing River, enjoying the beauty of the Little Three Gorges. In these pictures that were both poetry and painting, we admired the small boats traveling on the Jialing River, a group of haulers like the Volga boatmen, and the waterfalls with trickling streams. Afterward, we saw the scenic spots of Jin Yun Temple and Shao Long Temple, and the statues of Shanmu Yuan. Then, from Chongqing, we traveled to Chengdu, where, of course, the Wu Hou Temple, the Wen Shu Monastery, the Qing Yang Palace, the Shao Cheng Park, and the Xue Tao Well were all displayed before our eyes. These historical and valuable scenes were very harmonious, beautiful, and natural.</p>
<p>Li Bing, the Prefect of Qin and Shu County, governed the water in Guan County, using the six-character principle of "dig deep the riverbed and build low the dikes." For thousands of years, there have been no more floods. On the Min River, there is the An Lan Suspension Bridge and the Li Dui, both relics of Li Bing's water management. The great achievements of our ancestors are truly astonishing. Mr. Lang has photographed all these historical sites, filling us with infinite emotion. The most lovely is the An Lan Suspension Bridge, which is like a famous painting. Mount Qing Cheng is also in Guan County, where you can see fir trees and the misty clouds on the mountain peaks.</p>
<p>Jing-shan also has in-depth research on the inscriptions. For example, "Lonely Boat in the Evening Gorge," "Sunset over Mount Wu," "Dusk in the Cold Forest," and "Early Morning in the River Village." Although these sentences are only a few words, they are very vivid and to the point. The author loves to see landscape paintings, especially paying attention to the inscriptions. I remember a landscape painting by Lin Qin-nan that had a donkey rider walking on a mountain path. The artistic conception was very lofty. When I looked at the inscription, it read, "Walking near Sword Gate, chanting becomes even more bitter, each journey a mountain scene, each journey a poem." At that time, everyone who appreciated it was amazed, believing that both the poetry and painting were exquisite. Now, seeing the photography with inscriptions by Jing-shan, I also have the artistic conception of reading paintings from years ago.</p>
<p>People suffocating on the isolated island, you should not be discouraged, especially today, the second anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai. You cherish the free China and miss the entire vibrant Southwest. Today, you should visit this meaningful photography exhibition with enthusiastic hearts. Undoubtedly, you will be able to see Sichuan as if you were in the embrace of the motherland.</p>
<p>Finally, it should also be mentioned that the China Travel Service has recently published "Scenic Spots of the Southwest." This book includes all the works that Jing-shan is exhibiting today, as well as photographs of Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces. All the vibrant aspects of the Southwest are presented before your eyes. This book is also on sale at the venue today.</p>
<p>We wish Mr. Lang success in this photography exhibition, and we also hope that everyone will appreciate it, because the ticket sales will be used to help refugees.</p>

<h3>Over a Hundred Lawyers in This City Form a Judgment Interpretation Research Association, the Purpose of Which Is to Exchange Knowledge and Elucidate Legal Principles; Has Been Approved and Registered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration; Organization Outline Passed at Yesterday's Meeting, Etc.</h3>

<p>elucidate legal principles</p>
<p>Specifically, they jointly initiated the organization of the Shanghai Lawyers Association Judgment Interpretation Research Association. This organization was first proposed by lawyer Xu Zuo-liang. After the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, including Yuan Yang-an, submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval and registration, it was actively pursued. Lawyers in this city all supported this type of organization. Therefore, Yuan Yang-an, Xu Zuo-liang, Yu Cheng-xiu, Yu Zhong-luo, Ge Zhi-qin, Wang Xiao-wen, Tao Ran, Jiang Yi-ping, Chen Ting-rui, Wu Zheng-yue, Qu Yue, Wang Wei-zhen, Sun Zu-ji, Yang Si-cheng, Zhu Wen-de, Li Wen-jie, Zhang Zheng-xue, and over eighty others, gathered at the Hong Mian Restaurant on Rue Edouard VII at around 7 PM the night before. They held the inaugural meeting of the Judgment Interpretation Research Association on the spot. At that time, lawyer Yuan Yang-an was elected as chairman, and Ma Li-jiang was the recorder. First, lawyer Xu Zuo-liang reported on the significance of organizing the Judgment Interpretation Research Association, stating briefly that the judgments of courts at all levels and the legal interpretations of the Judicial Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration are the criteria for justice and are directly related to the rights and obligations of the parties concerned. The right or wrong of the reasons, or the existence of a crime, indirectly provide reference for judges and lawyers to cite and apply. Therefore, it must be based on fair inquiries and correct interpretations, and in terms of law, there is a natural and perfect beauty so as not to lose its</p>
<p>assigned mission</p>
<p>Otherwise, the meaning is biased and the situation is difficult, and there is a sense of dissatisfaction with the modern spirit of justice. Although the foundation of judicial solemnity is based on independent trial, which no agency can interfere with, the interpretation of judgments on the one hand represents the exercise of legal power by the state, and on the other hand confirms the actions and facts of the parties concerned, with significant implications for the degree of seriousness. We study it due to the needs of legal principles and case circumstances, which is also a contribution in the academic field. Upon investigation, in modern legal systems, judges, prosecutors, and lawyers are the three major functions in justice, and the spirit of justice is expressed through the practice of these three major functions. For example, when judges and prosecutors hear or prosecute cases, lawyers must appear in court to defend and elucidate legal principles, which embodies the meaning of balance and assistance in careful handling of cases. Currently, many scholars in Europe and the United States comment in detail on the judgments of courts at all levels and publish special collections. This not only promotes the evolution of legal principles, but also serves as a warning to some judges who rely on their legal status and do not take responsibility. At this point, Chairman Yuan Yang-an read out the Judgment Interpretation Research Association passed by the Executive Supervision Committee of the Lawyers Association.</p>
<p>Organization Outline</p>
<p>A total of eleven articles and detailed rules of procedure consisting of four chapters and twenty articles, were all passed. Six groups of candidates were nominated on the spot, including 28 people in the Civil Law Group, such as Zhang Zheng-xue, 20 people in the Criminal Law Group, such as Chen Ting-rui, 16 people in the Civil Procedure Law Group, such as Yu Zhong-luo, 15 people in the Criminal Procedure Law Group, such as Yu Cheng-xiu, 12 people in the Commercial Law Group, such as Wang Xiao-wen, and 8 people in the Miscellaneous Law Group, such as Qu Yue. It was also decided that the Judgment Interpretation Research Association would have five secretaries and three alternate secretaries. Each group would have one leader (i.e., convener), all of whom would be elected by the Standing Committee of the Lawyers Association using prepared ballots through postal voting. During the dinner, lawyers Li Wen-jie, Sun Zu-ji, Wang Xiao-wen, Wei Wei-qing, Wang Bo-xian, Chen Ting-rui, and others spoke in succession, all of which were to elucidate the essence of legal principles. They lectured while drinking until 9:30 PM, when they dispersed.</p>
<h3>Committed Numerous Evils, Died of Illness in Prison</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhang-bao, a Suzhou native residing at No. 5, Fuxing Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, who was 51 years old this year, engaged in various servile activities after the August 13th Incident in order to seek great profit. On February 27th of last year, he lured Wu Wang Xiu-juan, the wife of a friend from Ningbo, under the pretext of recommending her to work in a galoshes factory, to gather in Hongkou, and transported her by car to Hangzhou to be used as a prostitute for the entertainment of the local garrison for profit. The woman, unable to endure the suffering, managed to escape and, after many twists and turns, came to Shanghai. She then filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Zhu Zhang-bao of procuring her as a prostitute and disrupting public morals, requesting that he be severely punished according to the law. The presiding judge considered the case to be serious, so he first detained Zhu for investigation. As a result, he considered Zhu's criminal circumstances to be heinous and sentenced him to a heavy punishment. Zhu refused to accept the sentence and repeatedly appealed, but all appeals were rejected. He was then sent to prison to serve his sentence, which has been for a year and a half. Now, Zhu died of pulmonary tuberculosis in the Special No. 2 Prison. Medical treatment was ineffective, and the prison authorities reported the death to the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 Court for verification. His wife signed a guarantee to claim the body for burial. Those who do evil will meet such an end, which should be a warning to those who come later.</p>
<h3>French Police Strictly Arresting Drug Offenders</h3>
<p>Famous "Bai Xiang" (local toughs) Chen Zhang-lin, Wu Wan-liang (nickname "Big Monk") from Jiangbei, and others colluded with Korean vagrants to set up morphine dens in various streets and lanes, making huge profits, while countless people were victimized. In the past ten days, the French police have uncovered dozens of such dens. Among them, the den at No. 15, Hengmao Lane, Ba Xian Qiao, was the largest in scale. According to the confessions of the arrested criminals, all drug dens in the concession were controlled by Chen and Wu. Therefore, the police have ordered a strict manhunt.</p>
<h3>Ball Toss Injures Crown Crowd, Big Fire This Morning, Fire Breaks Out in the Warehouse of Da Zhong West Drug Store, Three Women Severely Burned, Six People Injured in Falls</h3>
<p>House number 5 in the Crown Crowd neighborhood of the Ball Toss arena on Nanjing Road, rented by Da Zhong West Drug Store, with a distribution department set up there. The owner of the store is Li Cheng-jiu. Due to having extra space, he sublet the second floor and mezzanine to a certain aunt and sister-in-law from Ningbo. At around 1:10 this morning, just as it was late at night and everyone was asleep, a fire suddenly broke out in the room where medicinal materials were stored. Because the medicines helped to fuel the fire, it quickly spread and became uncontrollable. The general residents, alerted by the police, woke up from their dreams, but the only ladder in the house had been burned down. As a result, six men and two women on the second floor jumped out of the windows, injuring six people, including one woman and five men. All suffered head injuries, fractures, and broken bones. The three women in the mezzanine did not escape. At this time, the Central Fire Brigade had already arrived in vehicles to put out the fire and rescue those in the surrounding areas. Meanwhile, firefighters erected a ladder and rescued two middle-aged women and a young woman, only eighteen years old, from the fire, but all had been burned and were unconscious. The injured nine men and women were rushed to Renji Hospital by ambulance. Among them, the three women burned by the fire were in critical condition. As there was no one in the drug store at the time, there were no injuries. At the same time, the Central Police Department also sent detectives to suppress the situation and investigate the cause of the fire. The fire was gradually extinguished until about 2 AM. The cause of the fire is still unknown. However, according to general reports, the store had a fire four or five months ago, so today's fire is the second time. The address of the store owner is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Social News</h3>

<p>Chen Tao-shi, a 30-year-old woman from Wuxi residing at No. 77, Hengde Lane, No. 452, Xujiahui Road, quarreled with her husband, Chen Jin-ren (33 years old), over her four-year-old child the day before yesterday (11th). After people persuaded her to stop, she became depressed and had a sudden suicidal thought. She took poison at home at midnight that day. Neighbor Cao Yong-yuan discovered it and sent her to Nanyang Hospital at No. 1, Avenue Dubail. Due to severe poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at noon yesterday.</p>
<p>At around 6:45 PM yesterday, five bandits suddenly broke into a certain estate at No. 26, Lane 688, Beijing Road, to rob.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read a news article in your newspaper about the death of Chen Lin-shi from poisoning. The part about me is inaccurate. When Chen Lin-shi was brought to the hospital by her brother, I refused to accept her because I saw that she was already dead and could not be saved. I did not give her two injections of a stimulant. During the autopsy, I was summoned for questioning by the police, not sent to court. This concerns the reputation of the doctor, so please correct this immediately to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Doctor Shen Ding-yang</p>
<p>November 12th</p>

<h3>Using Astrology and Evil Arts to Defraud Others of Money, Shi Kong-yu Defrauded of Over 60,000 Yuan, Yang Xia-min Still in Custody Pending Detailed Investigation</h3>
<p>Yang Qia-min (also known as Di An Le-tian), a native of Wuxi and owner of the Wei Li Duo MSG Factory at No. 131, 4th Floor, Hankou Road, is proficient in astrology. In the first month of the year before last, through the introduction of Zhang Zi-wei, he cast a horoscope for Shi Kong-yu, a Ningbo native engaged in the stock exchange business. He predicted that Shi would die in September. At Shi's request, he agreed to use the method of "connecting to life energy" to help him resolve the crisis. The method was to set up an altar to worship the gods, and to offer the gods cash and banknotes as a way to suppress evil spirits. In the process, Yang repeatedly used trickery to swindle Shi out of</p>
<p>cash offerings</p>
<p>To date, the cash he offered to the gods amounted to no less than tens of thousands of gold. Yang ordered the paper package of cash to be stored in the vault of the Jin Cheng Bank, claiming that the life energy had been successfully connected, and Shi's life would be safe. After that, Yang and Shi became close friends. Shi also invested tens of thousands in the Wei Li Duo factory under a pseudonym, and guaranteed loans for Yang to the bank. Recently, Yang saw that Shi had run out of money, so he used the same method to swindle Shi's wife's jewelry. At that time, Shi's wife was also deceived by him and</p>
<p>remained in the dark</p>
<p>Recently, when she needed to use the jewelry, it had all been turned into blank paper. Yang's scam was exposed. After reporting to the General Police Department, Chinese detectives Jiang Shang-pei and Yang Pei-sheng arrested Yang and sent him to the Special No. 1 Court for interrogation and detention. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Last Saturday, Judge Dai Rong-duo continued the trial in the Criminal Division 4. Shi Kong-yu also hired lawyers Wu Lin-kun and Xiao Bai-chuan to appear in court and file a civil suit, calculating that Yang had defrauded him of investment guarantees, bad checks, and other expenses, totaling</p>
<p>sixty-eight thousand</p>
<p>More than yuan, requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate him. Police lawyer Qian Xun-jiu detailed the fraudulent methods of the defendant Yang Qia-min (already detailed in previous reports, omitted). He also stated that in the adjournment, the police went to the Jin Cheng Bank vault to open the paper money that Yang had offered to the gods, and found that it was all blank paper and ghost money. The police also seized a large amount of his money in the defendant's office, which shows that the defendant used his astrology to swindle money from others. It is</p>
<p>undoubtedly true</p>
<p>It was also found that the defendant had committed many other similar cases in addition to defrauding Shi Kong-yu, which have not yet been verified. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the investigation for further investigation. Then Shi Kong-yu submitted a complaint detailing how Yang Qia-min defrauded him of money, invested in the Wei Li Duo factory, guaranteed loans to the bank, and how Yang used post-dated checks to pay off debts. In response, Yang Qia-min</p>
<p>partly admitted</p>
<p>Otherwise, some claimed that it was a loan nature, etc., Dai's car verified and the supply was made to Yang for detention, and the retrial was adjourned for one week. He heard that those who were defrauded of money by Yang in the same way included Xu Wen-xing (Zixing), 16,000 yuan, and Zhang Jing-wu, 14,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation</p>
<h3>Premier's Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Meng Bai</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Premier's birthday, which reminded me of the Premier's life. In his private life, he was very frugal. He only knew how to work for national affairs, and material enjoyment was not on his mind. In this regard, we can see it from all aspects of the Premier's clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. I will briefly describe the Premier's clothing, food, shelter, and transportation below, based on the reference books, newspapers, and photos.</p>
<p>Clothing In his early years, the Premier always wore long robes and small hats. Later, he ran around for national affairs and fled overseas several times. In addition to wearing Chinese clothes, he also wore Western suits. In the 21st year of Guangxu, when the Premier was 30 years old, he led his comrades to attack Guangzhou as a base and opened Qianheng Bank in Yao Port as headquarters, and established an agricultural society in Guangzhou. However, on September 9th, due to careless transportation of weapons, the matter failed, and Ling Hao-dong and others all died. The Premier went from Guangzhou to Hong Kong via Jian Road and crossed to Japan, and then cut his hair and changed his clothes to revisit Honolulu to promote the Zhonghe Society. This is also a memorable page in the history of the Premier's clothing. In his later years, he often wore casual clothes that were a modified version of Western suits, which is now called the Sun Yat-sen suit. When the Premier took office as the Provisional President in the first year of the Republic of China and as the Grand Marshal of the Army and Navy in the sixth year of the Republic of China, he wore the clothing of the President and Grand Marshal, respectively. It is especially worth mentioning that the Premier's clothing was mostly made of ordinary silk cloth, not expensive fabrics.</p>
<p>Food The Premier was very casual about food, whether Chinese or Western. He only sought to fill his stomach and did not seek abundance. Moreover, when discussing major issues and planning military and party affairs, he often forgot to eat, day and night. He thought that saving the country was more important than eating!</p>
<p>Shelter The Premier's hometown is also Hengcun, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, which everyone knows. There is also a self-built house there, but because he was born in a farmer's family, the house has the scenery of a village house and a farmhouse. Later, the Premier left his hometown and ran around for the revolution. Although he served as Provisional President and Grand Marshal, he only had a foreign house on Molie Avenue in the French Concession in Shanghai, and no other houses. It is said that even this foreign house was given to him by others.</p>
<p>Transportation Regarding the aspect of transportation, we can divide it into two ways of speaking. In terms of walking, the Premier was also very casual and did not necessarily have to sit in an expensive car. He would take ordinary boats and cars. If there was something to do, he would immediately go and do it without hesitation. In terms of behavior, he advocated the theory that it is easy to do what is known to be difficult. Therefore, he only worried about not knowing the urgency. As soon as he knew what should be promoted and reformed, he would move forward with a fearless spirit.</p>
<h3>Clothes That Resist Mustard Gas</h3>
<p>— Lu Li Shi</p>
<p>When the European War first broke out, Poland and Germany had a fierce battle. Although Warsaw, Poland, was occupied by the German army, this was not a disgrace to the Polish people. It was entirely because the German government took the great risk of releasing mustard gas. When the super-era killing weapon descended on the heads of the Polish people, the Polish soldiers, whose tactics and weapons were not weak, could only accept the tragic order to retreat.</p>
<p>Mustard gas is the demon king of poison gases. It not only damages people's respiratory organs, but also corrodes the skin. When a mustard gas bomb is launched from a gun or an airplane, it immediately turns into smoke-like gas and spreads everywhere. Soldiers can only prevent contact with it by wearing an airtight suit—a suit that resists mustard gas.</p>
<p>Professor Bullart of Hobart University in New York, USA, invented a medicinal juice that can resist mustard gas. Clothes soaked in this medicinal juice can absorb mustard gas and make it lose its toxicity. That effectiveness can last for several months. In addition to wearing this kind of clothing, soldiers must also bring gloves, headscarves, and special leather shoes. If the Polish army had been equipped with this kind of anti-gas clothing earlier, perhaps Warsaw would not have been lost so easily. But what is that kind of medicinal juice called? Because the United States government attaches great importance to this invention, which is a military matter, it cannot be publicly released for the time being. One day, mustard gas will become a waste product. Look! The demon king's strong enemy.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes About Crabs</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Holding a crab and raising a cup is one of life's pleasures. In this crisp autumn season, it is the time when rice fields are fragrant and crabs are plump. Therefore, gourmets are carrying them to the market in strings to buy wine and fill their plates with seasonal delicacies. Although there are many refugees and impoverished people on this isolated island, even facing food shortages, those with money are keen to enjoy their own culinary delights first! As for crabs, because they have many legs, sharp claws, and move sideways, they are generally used to symbolize the fierce and tyrannical. Moreover, because their actions are not upright, it is believed that they cannot last long, hence the warning: "Let's see how long you can scuttle sideways!" However, the thoughts of poets are different; they interpret and express pity for the crab: "Knowing that grain-eating creatures are originally innocent, but what else can one do about their delightful taste before a wine pot?" This is entirely for the sake of culinary desires! I will not criticize this further but recall one or two anecdotes to amuse the readers.</p>
<p>The Qing dynasty person Li Meian, was nicknamed "One Li, Hundred Crabs." One explanation is that he could eat a hundred crabs in a meal, which shows a great appetite, but I doubt it is true. As for famous crab painters throughout history, there are indeed many. The most ingenious was a certain painter (some say it was Li Meian) who was skilled at painting crabs but charged high prices. He required one gold piece for each crab, paid in advance. A certain gentleman thought his price was too high and negotiated for half the price, giving him five gold pieces, and commissioned him to paint ten crabs. The painter reluctantly agreed. The next day, when he went to collect the painting, he saw that the ten crabs were positioned with only half of their bodies exposed, along the edge of a jar, leaning against a stone, or in the grass. The gentleman accused him of cheating, but the painter calmly replied, "Isn't half a crab worth half a price? I painted five crabs for five gold pieces, as per the previously agreed price. How am I cheating?" The gentleman silently retreated.</p>
<p>Legend has it that in olden times, farmers in a certain place feared crabs as if they were deities, daring not to catch them and unaware that they could be eaten. Therefore, the crabs roamed freely in the rice paddies, eating most of the grain. The farmers reported the famine to the county magistrate. After the magistrate inquired about the appearance of the pests, he ordered them to catch as many as possible and bring them to the yamen. Soon, the yamen was piled high with baskets of crabs. The magistrate further instructed the cooks to boil them and serve them to the staff for a feast. The farmers were amazed—and then the people of that place all followed suit and began to eat crabs. This story may seem like a humorous tale, but customs vary from place to place. Compared to the food of inland China and the uncivilized regions of the Miao and Man peoples, there is a great difference. Therefore, it is possible that the people of a certain place in the past did not dare to eat crabs, or it could be a true story.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Branch Verses on Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Jianzhong of Wuxi, who loves to compose poetry, compiled "Echoes in the Lake." After seeking refuge in Shanghai, he founded Hongdao School, teaching tirelessly. Recently, seeing how difficult it is to live in Shanghai, he composed "Bamboo Branch Verses of Shanghai," divided into four sections: "Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation." Although they are playful works, they accurately depict the suffering of living on this isolated island. They will appeal to those who have the heart. I am reprinting them in this publication to share with readers: (1) Frequent war disasters bring endless suffering, ten houses are empty, nine of them are empty, cotton prices are high and sleeves are thin, how will we resist the autumn wind? (Clothing) (2) Drifting on an isolated island, a guest's lament, the high prices of everything are alarming, rice is like pearls and firewood is like cassia, a stone of yellow flour costs forty gold. (Food) (3) Sheltered in the foreign concession, a temporary paradise, rent for a single room is twenty yuan. I have a home but cannot return, sighing in sorrow. (Housing) (4) The journey inland is full of hardships. Donating money to get a certificate is the only way to travel, who knows if the paper is real or fake, you still have to be careful of being slapped. (Transportation)</p>
<h3>A One-Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Pig liver seems like a very ordinary thing, but according to doctors, it has very nourishing properties and is beneficial to the body. Therefore, if you can't think of any meat dishes every day, then eating some fried liver oil is not only economical but also nourishing. The most common way to cook fried liver oil is to chop pickled mustard greens into small pieces and stir-fry them in a pot. Although it doesn't have any special flavor, it's still quite tasty with rice. If you use freshly pickled cabbage instead of pickled mustard greens, it will taste even more refreshing. If you don't like oil and eat pig liver on its own, then steam it, slice it thinly, and mix it with soy sauce, sesame oil, and celery, it's also very delicious. In addition, chicken liver and duck liver have the same effect as pig liver, and their taste is naturally better than pig liver.</p>

<h3>On the Evolution of "Transportation" in Our Country</h3>
<p>— The Editorial Department</p>
<p>The need for transportation is shared by humans and all animals. However, humans cannot fly with wings like birds, run on four hooves like beasts, or swim with fins and scales like fish. Therefore, if there were no roads or the creation of means of transportation, human movement would be hindered everywhere by nature, and there would be no smooth progress. At the same time, human culture would never be able to develop. Therefore, progress in transportation has a great relationship with the progress of world civilization. Now, I will discuss the evolution of transportation in our country:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about land transportation. In the early nomadic era, people already knew how to use livestock and manufacture vehicles. As the "Book of Origins" says, "Fuxi began to ride oxen and horses, and made whips and sticks to dominate. Xuanyuan made carriages and roads, and Shaohao made ox carts." At that time, the roads were just natural paths on mountain trails or plains. By the Zhou Dynasty, the government had officials in charge of roads throughout the country, and they divided the roads into five types: "path, border, coating, road, and highway." A path could accommodate oxen and horses, a border could accommodate large carts, a coating could accommodate one carriage, a road could accommodate two carriages, and anything that could accommodate three or more carriages was called a highway. At the same time, carts were also divided into many levels based on the number of horses pulling them. When Qin Shi Huang unified the six kingdoms, he wanted "to make the tracks of carriages uniform throughout the world, and the script the same." Therefore, he built major roads throughout the country. Jia Shan said, "Qin built roads to all parts of the empire, reaching Yan and Qi in the east, and Wu and Yue in the south. All the views along the rivers and seas were reached. The roads were fifty paces wide, with trees planted every three zhang, and thickly built on the outside." At the same time, he also dug the Jianmen Plank Road to connect to Bashu. The achievements of this ambitious man in the history of transportation in our country cannot be denied. Then, during the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Wuhou opened up the ancient Sichuan-Yunnan road. By this point, it can be said that the east-west and north-south land transportation throughout the country was fully prepared.</p>
<p>As for water transportation? It also existed in the earliest times. The "Book of Changes" says, "Hollowing out wood to make boats, carving wood to make oars." This is the dugout canoe that barbarians used to hollow out wood with fire, which was of course very crude. Later, it was improved many times. The "Book of Origins" says, "Zhuanxu made poles and oars, Emperor Jun made tugboats, Yao made mooring ropes, Xia Yu made tugs… Wu Zixu made war junks." By this time, the form of boats and oars was complete. Some people even slightly modified boats and oars to become floating bridges, which are called "building bridges with boats." As for the construction of real bridges, it didn't happen until the Warring States period! The improvement of boats and oars also had great achievements. For example, the war junks of Wang Jun of Jin who went down to Yizhou, and the giant ships of Zheng He of Ming who crossed the South Seas, are both famous in history. The waterways from the Sui Dynasty Emperor Yang's opening of the Ji Canal, the Hangou Canal, and the Grand Canal, also facilitated transportation a lot.</p>
<p>The above all discuss the situation in our country during the era of isolation. As for modern times? Since the nineteenth century, Fulton in Europe and America invented the steamboat, Stephenson invented the train, and the Wright brothers invented the airship. Thus, in addition to land and water transportation, there was an increase in air transportation. All these means of transportation—steamships, steamboats, submarines, trains, automobiles, trams, airships, balloons, airplanes, etc.—were introduced to China. At the same time, railways, highways, and tramways were built, and neither high altitudes, towering mountains, nor great rivers can be obstacles to "transportation." However, compared to European and American countries, there is a world of difference. This is what our people should strive for. But after reading the newspaper recently, I know that the central government plans to develop the Great Southwest, and is currently building railways and highways, which is enough to make us very happy.</p>

<h3>Two Years</h3>
<p>— Huang Ziqiang</p>
<p>Two years! It has been two years since the fall of Shanghai! But that tragic and exciting scene will be forever engraved in my heart and deeply imprinted in my mind forever.</p>
<p>It was the day of the European Peace Commemoration. I attended the memorial ceremony in front of the Statue of Peace on the Bund and returned, but in Nanshi, a stone's throw away, the prelude to resisting the invaders was unfolding.</p>
<p>Nanshi, this ancient city, is the most familiar place of my birth and growth! Since I was able to understand that I was a person, I remember that the alley where my family lived was the most lovely alley. It ran through Zhonghua Road and Zhaojia Road, but a stranger from outside would never know that this was the most convenient shortcut. Even rickshaw pullers who understood shortcuts could not pass through this small alley because of the wooden stakes blocking the entrance. Thus, this small alley was our children's free world. Playing football and kicking shuttlecock would not be disturbed by vehicles, and what made us most happy was hiding from each other, letting the other person pass through the two main roads without seeing a shadow. This was a lovely small alley that was almost like a maze.</p>
<p>Until I tearfully bid farewell to Nanshi, I couldn't bear to move out of this small alley and move to other places with more convenient access. The impression this small alley gave me was too deep!</p>
<p>Two years ago today, I finally left my home of more than twenty years. What a painful farewell!</p>
<p>At that time, my mother had just fallen ill, and she was very ill. I don't know how much my father and elder sister persuaded her, but she was unwilling to leave that dilapidated house.</p>
<p>"You go! My illness may be useless! And I can't call for a vehicle. You have brought so many things, can you still take me with you? Go! Go! I heard that several iron gates in the French Concession have been closed..."</p>
<p>In this alley, on the first day, I saw such a panicked and chaotic situation. Carrying the old and supporting the young, carrying things by hand and shoulder, people were rushing towards the two entrances like refugees, pushing and shoving each other. Seeing the urgency of the situation, my father did not wait for my mother to argue any further, and with my elder sister's help, supported her as she left our home, this small alley.</p>
<p>The vehicles, crowds, boxes, and items on Minguo Road were so crowded that it was impossible to tell what was yours and what was mine. It seemed that it was drizzling that day, and the road was even more muddy and difficult to walk on. At each iron gate of the French Concession, there was a dark mass of people. My mother was knocked down and helped up several times, and she kept shouting, "You go!" But at that time, her voice could not be heard at all.</p>
<p>As if in a dream, I can't remember who helped our family of four squeeze into the French Concession, but I remember that it was a middle-aged man who said, "Everyone is fleeing, why distinguish between each other?"</p>
<p>In less than two months, my mother died! She had not left home for fifty-three years, but she died outside. Her last words were, "I will not rest in peace even in death!"</p>
<p>Two years! Her body has not yet been buried, and the house in Nanshi is probably a pile of rubble, right? But my father always said angrily, "I can't bury her without returning to Nanshi. We should remember her last words!"</p>
<h3>Responding to the Call for Winter Clothing</h3>

<h3>Increased Meal Fees - It Turns Out the Teachers are Doing Rice Business</h3>
<p>— A Parent</p>
<p>A month ago, I received a bill from my second son's school for an increase in meal fees. When I saw that it was six yuan, although I was a bit strapped for cash, the fee was increased for a good reason, so I didn't think it was wrong. At that time, rice cost about forty yuan per stone, and coal briquettes cost three or four yuan per dan. Which of the soy sauce, salt, vinegar, and vinegar didn't increase in price? How could the school maintain the same meal fees as when the prices hadn't increased? I even felt that an increase of only six yuan wouldn't be enough. Really, aside from my own economic situation, anyone who has managed a household would understand the plight of the kitchen bosses at that time.</p>
<p>A few days ago, my eldest son's school also sent a notice of an increase in meal fees, which surprised me. I was surprised that it didn't come a month earlier. A month ago, it was when prices were soaring. Now, market prices have fallen a lot. Why didn't they increase the fees when prices were rising, but now they want to increase them when prices have fallen? And they want to increase it by thirty yuan, an increase of sixty percent of the original amount!</p>
<p>The boarding fee at my eldest son's school is thirty yuan, and the meal fee is fifty yuan. If they increase it by another thirty yuan now, then the boarding and meal fees will be one hundred and ten yuan per semester. I ask, which school has such high boarding and meal fees? According to my eldest son, the side dishes in the school are terribly bad. A bowl of bean sprouts can be used four times. The first time, it's stewed plainly. The second time, it's topped with a few pieces of pork skin. The third time, it's stir-fried with vermicelli. The fourth time, it can still be eaten with porridge in the morning. Of course, I wouldn't completely believe my eldest son's words. He might be exaggerating, but at least you can see a glimpse of how bad the side dishes are. However, my eldest son's school has a student meal committee. When this fee increase came up, the committee negotiated with the kitchen. The result of the negotiation was that the fee increase was not the right of the kitchen. Because this time, the kitchen didn't ask the school to increase the fees at all. Before the prices increased, the school gave the kitchen one and a half yuan per table per day. After the prices increased, it was increased to two yuan and four jiao per table. But the fifty yuan meal fee that the students paid was enough to give the kitchen two yuan and five jiao per table, which is one jiao per table more than what the school gave the kitchen after the price increase. If they increase it by another thirty yuan now, wouldn't this huge fee completely fall into the pockets of the school authorities? Now, let's not worry about how the outside prices are. Just ask the school to explain the reason for the increase in fees. If it's because of rising prices, then please don't bother, because the kitchen boss, whose interests are involved, didn't ask the school authorities to increase the fees. If it's for other reasons, then please also state the reasons so that everyone can understand.</p>
<p>The reason has come! My eldest son said that the teachers in the school are all "doing" rice business on the side. They bought a large amount of rice when it was thirty or forty yuan. Unexpectedly, now that it has fallen, they will lose a lot of money. Therefore, they are selling it to the kitchen at the original price plus interest. But the kitchen can still maintain itself, so the reason for this fee increase is not because prices are rising, and it's not because the kitchen can't maintain itself, but it's really in the hands of the school that receives the money. They will borrow a small storm to swallow a large sum of money. However, I heard that the student council of the school has already risen up in resistance. Of course, we don't want any unfortunate events to happen in the education community during this period of national crisis, but as a parent, I don't want to send money to the school for no reason.</p>
