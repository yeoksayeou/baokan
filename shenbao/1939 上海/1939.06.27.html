<p>（香港）軍息潮汕鐵路綫戰况華有開展、日因庵埠附近作戰困難、繞道攻新塘、尙在附近激戰中、另息在汕登陸日軍、有水陸並進企圖、陸路沿鐵路線進逼、暫以潮安爲目的、水路則乘水漲由韓江威脅揭陽、華軍已分別嚴防、韓江方面、現華日兩軍隔河對峙中、（二十六日專電）</p>
<p>（香港）韶關電、華援軍紛紛開潮汕、已成拉鋸形勢、梅溪方面華日隔河對峙中、湖陽束湖日軍被華軍截擊、無法續進、汕頭四基圍日軍被圍擊、在困鬥中、日軍犯潮汕、打通閩粵計劃、已被粉碎、（二十六日下午專電）</p>

<p>（香港）汕頭情形仍混亂英日又發生衝突、英海軍當局日前派艦護送濟南·阜生·兩輪入汕後、日方卽提抗議、復在英國碼頭周圍架設鐵絲網、並派兵守衛、嚴密檢查通過行人、貨物亦不許運入碼頭、此項封鎖、對港糧食頗多影響、又港汕交通雖在英艦保護下尙可通航、惟開汕者仍少、且因情况不明、苦力均已散去、貨物運卸困難、而運港客貨又稀、故各輪多存觀望、此外港各潮汕行莊、現多已設法另關貿易途徑、（二十六日電）</p>
<p>（香港）據今日此問消息、關於日本海軍最近下令各國船隻開汕、必須依照廣州辦法、大受限制、英船開汕每星期不得超過一艘之事、英國駐汕領事已向新到日領事提出抗議、並向日方表示、假若日本欲對英船行動擅加干涉、則英國海軍將採軍艦衛護商船之辦法、現汕頭尙稱平安、又迷惑頭外灘一帶、亦滿駐日軍步哨、不准華人搭乘英船、關於此點汕頭英領事亦在抗議書中向日領提出、又日本海軍當局曾通知英方、略謂日方保有搜查來汕英船之權、但英領則謂英方已命令其海軍隨時保護英國之船隻、（二十六日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（香港）今日此間英國官方宣稱、日本軍隊已沿汕頭英國碼頭週圍架設通電鐵絲網、使汕頭成爲實際上封鎖、英國船隻、雖仍被允駛入汕頭港內、然因碼頭一帶已架設鐵絲網、以致苦力無從卸貨、英國兵艦「薩內特」號、及美國兵艦「匹爾斯堡」號、仍留汕頭、英兵艦「偵察」號、則於昨日返港、據稱，汕頭情形安靜、中國軍隊尙未向汕頭反攻、（二十六日美聯社電）</p>
<p>韶關　日於進犯汕頭之時、曾廣作宣傳、謂油頭爲華僑匯款樞紐、每年經該市匯進之款達二億元、故有侵汕必要等語、藉以掩飾其驅逐英美商業勢力及在軍事上威脅香港之野心、記者特以此事叩詢華南金融界權威、據談日方此種宣傳、無非欲愚弄歐美人士、减弱世人對其犯汕之重視、幷欲欺騙華僑、斷絕其父母妻子生活、使數百萬華僑受一打擊、汕頭每年匯進之華僑匯款、僅爲國幣七千萬元、廣東省銀行現在潮安·梅縣·大埔·興寗·杕口（梅縣東北部）曁粵贛各重要縣市以及新加坡香港等地均設有分行、共他各省、該行亦可代爲轉匯、廣東省銀行信用昭著、南洋與粵省內地通匯、儘可由該行辦理、日人此種無常識之宣傳、徒暴露其心勞日拙而已、（二十五日電）</p>

<p>（重慶）據華方今晚消息、自華方大軍陸續開抵汕頭近郊後、該處日軍已一籌莫展、華軍自攻克菴埠後、現仍繼續沿潮汕鐵路向南推進、在達濠方面之日軍、現已無法前進、同時菴埠附近梅溪之日軍、則已完全爲華軍殲滅、聞目前犯汕頭之日軍、卽爲駐在廣州方面之日軍第二〇四師團、（二十五日美聯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）天津事件、頃由此問各報賡續加以評論、語氣之問、業已較爲樂觀、咸謂此事現有就地解決之可能、金融泰晤士報載稱、「英國駐日大使克萊琦爵士、曾於本月二十四日再度會見日本外相有田、聞當於本日向政府當局提出報吿、昨日晚問、政府方面顯已較爲樂觀、以爲遠東方面、雖仍危機四伏、但未嘗不能與日本當局進行正式談判、至談判基礎如何、迄至昨晚爲止、尙未明瞭、要之、政府當局業已飭令克萊琦大使向日本政府聲明、謂英國在華所保有之利益與威望、決當加以維護、現信天津專件仍有就地解決之可能、萬一日本固執成見、則英國究當採取何種舉動、此一問題、內閣在克萊琦大使與有田外相會晤之前、亦曾提付討論、各閣員對於經濟報復之議、初甚贊成、嗣經再三考慮之後、僉謂英國政策之主耍目標、乃欲限制糾紛範圍、茲若採取經濟報復、結果恐適得其反、爰乃改變方針、就海軍示威運動是吾較爲有效一層、加以考慮、」每日電聞報則主張採取强硬態度、其言有云、德國宣傳部長郭培爾昨日發表演說、曾以侮辱與挑釁之詞句、讚美天津日軍勒令英僑去衣受檢之暴行、彼國社黨徒嘗以野蠻舉動、加諸德國籍猶太人、茲見日軍暴行、以爲吾道不孤、其引爲同調、自無足怪、張伯倫首相一再宣稱、此種侮辱、實難容忍、英國輿論對於首相此語、咸皆贊同、惟日軍當局或故意使英國難堪、亦未可知、郭培爾乃揚言英國政府必無能爲力、不知吾國軍備日見充實、正如首相所謂、應付未來事變、業已有恃無恐、惟就中國方面種種事變而論、吾人不難有自信力、而難於處以鎭靜耳、彼有理智的民族、吾人固願與之討論理智、至于喪失理智的民族、志在一意孤行、對於吾人理智的呼籲、誤爲示弱、誤爲意志不定、吾人倘仍與之討論理智、殊爲危險、時至此日、吾人未可壓迫政府、强其在某一時期、探取某種舉動、俾使吾人呼聲能爲他國所聆取、關於此層、凡具有責任心者、固無不知之、但政府當局抵抗侵略與反對稱覇一項政策、已爲全國一致擁護、此則袞袞諸公、亦當明瞭、似此、吾人旣已決定一種立塲、若再畏縮、則爲禍之烈、以視採取堅決態度、允有甚焉、」泰晤士報載稱、政府仍望天津事伴有就地解決之可能、惟日本若果擴大範圍、要求英國助紂爲虐、當然無遝就之餘地、反之、日方要求若以引渡程錫庚案四華人爲限、則英國政府仍願與之進行談判、」（二十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>津租界封鎖形勢日緊　運輸食物不易　英軍卡車亦遭留難　英軍當局事前曾向日方說明　停給軍認為等於戰爭行為　此舉已引起一船人甚大關切　煽惑事件續有發生</h3>
<p>（天津）今日又發生英軍運輸食物卡車被阻事三起、已引起一般人甚大之關切、蓋聞英軍當局在日方發表封鎖租界宣言之時、曾向日方說明、如停止英軍之食物接濟、則將認爲等於戰事行爲也、共中之第一起、係發生於今午十二時五十分、有晨間由英租界開出之英軍採辦食物卡車兩輛、駛回馬塲道南端之出入口、欲入租界、共中一輛係英軍所有、上乘英軍官及司機英兵各一名、另一輛係借自天津商團者、亦由英兵司機並有軍官一名、四人皆野制服、惟未帶武器、該處日軍堅不放入、天津英駐軍長官狄拉曼少校聞訊趕至時、該處負責之日軍官適行離去、後經五十分鐘之談商、該兩軍卒開入租界、下午三時一刻、復有英軍西蒙斯中尉、及兵士八人、乘卡車一輛、企圖由馬塲道南止端出英租界購牛、以作軍隊食物、當被日軍阻通過、英軍當局得訊後、卽電話通知日總領事署、日領署人員允立郎設法、逾十分鐘後、有日哨兵一名、持一紙條、詢問該卡車來自何處、將欲何往、西蒙斯中尉當在該紙條上書明「來自英租界、欲赴賽馬塲、」日哨兵後在電話中報吿頗久、復持一紙條、詢問英軍卡車何時可以駛返、西蒙斯中尉又答以「的在下午四五點之問、」日哨兵復在電話中報吿、其時狄拉曼少校又得訊趕至、卽與該處負責之日軍官用日語商談、歷時甚久、始允該卡車通過、計在該處停留四十五分鐘、英軍共購得十牛、運入租界時、未經留難、郎行放入、今日祇有小數食物運入租界、而允以牛奶之供給、更爲嚴重、同時租界之內、繼續有煽惑事件發生、與租界以外有關係之商店主人均受警吿、不得繼續以食物供給外人、並以危害其在租界外之親友相恫嚇、租界內之燃煤、亦漸感缺乏、煤末之供給、雖尙充足、但廚房使用之塊煤、已將吿聲、天津華人方而對於封鎖租界之可能的未來發展、現有兩種風說、有謂封鎖將自六月三十日起更加嚴厲、屆時將祗有特別通行證之華人可以通行、又有謂封鎖限制、將自六月三十日起、大見緩和、並稱屆時封鎖事宜、將交與北平「臨時政府」辦理、衆料「臨時政府」、將派天津「市長」與英當局作解決此事之談判、（廿六日路透社電）</p>

<h3>中蘇商約與中蘇</h3>
<p>前天，中蘇兩國當局同時宣布中蘇商的已於六月十六日在莫斯科簽了字。全文未經發表，吾們無從窺知全豹；據昨天外電所傳：商務條欵之外，尙有關於一般互助的規定，確吾有待明證。但這决訂的，完全以平等與互惠的原則爲基礎；至少關於中蘇兩國間的商業與航行，確立了共通的軌範；這是絕無疑義的。從此以後，兩國的往來必更便利而密切，兩國的關係必更合理而穩定；未來的發展，亦獲得了渾厚有力的出發點，原來國與國的相處，十之八九在乎商務；而國與國的條的，亦以商的爲最普遍而平凡；換一方面言之，商的乃爲國際最正常最重要之條的。惟其普遍而平凡，故不必大吹大擂；惟其正常而重要，故亦未蔑視爲照例文章。雖然，這决中蘇兩國商的的宣告成立，却應刮目相看。</p>
<p>就商的本質而論：中蘇兩國雖事賓上貿易不輟，但無條的爲之根據，關於訂立商的的談判，已經悠久的歲月，已耗無量的脣舌，祗因雙方見解參商，且有種種事實的技術的困難，故屢議無成；今乃宣告正式簽字，吾們至少爲了商的多年的難產而感覺這决商的成文的可喜可慰。何况中國正在抗戰之中，海口淪陷殆盡，對外貿易，端賴陸上交通；而中國綿延迢遠的大陸界綫，存乎中蘇兩國間者，乃佔全部界綫的五分之三以上；這也夠說明訂約通商的重要性了。又不但如此而已，蘇聯對於抗戰中的中國，所作實力援助，吾們無從以數字說明其數量與本質之大；然其爲極大，乃爲當世一致之估量；此在物質上有其無上之價値，自不待言，而間接表示之精神價値，允屬微妙而宏偉之甚。允如七七與八一三之間，簽訂了互不侵犯協定，幷且在八一三後一星期，公開地露布了；這可以說是精神援助，精神價値的具體化！故當時侵略中國者因此吃了一大驚；各友邦朝野輿情都替中國稱慶，又憶法國報紙曾比之爲蠻牛頸上的一枝火箭。事隔兩年而至今日，中國顯示抗戰的再接再厲，而日本旣欲罷不能，復徬徨失措之際，中蘇間再來一個商的；無論商的內容不若外電所傳之包含一般互助的規定，然在此時而有此事，其意義所及，精神所示，要無不遠出於正常而平凡的國際商的之上！故我們應該論斷此的爲蘇聯對中國極端友好的表示，也爲中國在外交上極有價値的成功！</p>
<p>中國抗戰兩年，獲得了全世界正義人類的深切同情，獲得了全世界愛好和平的民族和國家的熱烈援助。就性質言之，當然不以援助的多少，分辨同情的厚薄，其價値是同樣可珍的。可是在這無量數的同情和援助中，首屈一指的却無疑是中蘇友誼的日益增進。中蘇關係的日益密切，不僅爲歷史的和地理的因素所決定，主要還是因爲蘇聯一方面固以「援助被壓迫民族爭取解放」爲基本政策；一方面也因爲蘇聯能從大處遠處着眼，以利害的共通而不吝犧牲；這是逈異於資本主義計較錙銖近利之處。原來中蘇兩國，有友誼的堅實基礎，他們又有共同的目標。他們的利益是一致的，他們站在反法西斯侵略的共同陣綫上。兩年以來，蘇聯給予中國的援助確乎最大，無論在國際外交壇坫上，無論在物質接濟上。雖亦有人以蘇聯不出兵爲憾，雖中國人希望蘇聯出兵是情理之常，但顧到國際全局，便不能不原諒蘇聯的不出兵，便不能斷言於蘇聯出兵愈勝於物質援助的源源不絕。從中蘇互不侵犯條的到中蘇商的，正表現着一個中蘇關係愈密的趨向。但願在商約成立之後，蘇聯更多多的援助中國，俾中國及早完成抗戰制勝的大業！</p>

<h3>鎭海口將封鎖　滬甬交通又中斷　定海淪陷寗波嚴密戒備　德平謀福今晨自甬返滬　定海巷戰仍烈</h3>
<p>自日軍在定海登陸、佔領縣城後、寗波因距離較近、故形勢頗呈緊張、甬防守司令部爲加强防務、鎭海口將重行禁航、留甬之德平·謀福·兩輪、定今晨離甬駛滬、至滬溫航錢則仍暢通、定海衜頭、泊有日艦兩艘、城內仍有巷戰、　山方面、巳嚴密戒備、茲探誌各情如次</p>
<p>滬甬禁航</p>
<p>日軍近以鄂中戰事、形成膠着狀態、迄無絲毫進展、致國內人心厭戰反戰空氣、日趨濃厚、爲刺激民心起見、乃改向沿海之汕頭進攻、並於二十三日起侵入定海、以圖挽回、華方因定海係屬孤島、在軍事上並無申大意義、故未駐紮大軍、經常地自衛團警英勇抵抗後、即行放棄縣城、退守靑嶺一帶二道防錢、自定海失陷後、寗波因距離較近（按僅隔三十五海哩）、故形勢頓呈緊張、據航業界昨日下午接得電吿、甬防守司令部爲加强防務起見、擬將鎭海口重行禁航、其性質將與前决封鎖時同、留備現作封鎖綫通航缺口之老太平輪、則不致下沉、</p>

<p>滬溫暢通</p>
<p>滬甬綫宣吿重行封鎖後、上海與浙海間之交通、僅剩溫州一錢、現仍照常暢通、除中意公司之恩德輪、巳於昨日下午駛溫外、意商華義洋行之寶利·德商魯麟洋行之飛康、均定今晨直放溫州、德商禮和洋行之海福、則定明晨啟椗、據航業界消息、溫州近數日來、情形頗欠安謐、防務轉趨鞏固、故如無特殊情形、則該錢航運、可望不致阻礙</p>
<p>定海巷戰</p>
<p>據昨晨搭寶利輪由溫抵滬之某客云、寶利輪於二十五日上午九時經過定海洋面時、見東嶽宮山脚下定海衜道（按該處即係輪船碼頭）泊有日艦兩艘、又嶴山洋面怕有日艦一艘、並聞隆隆砲聲、及機關槍聲、發自定海、足證該處仍有激烈巷戰也、至東嶽宮一帶大火、則巳熄滅、又據另一消息、定海居民人數的三萬、在日軍登陸前、早已疏散、避入山區、政府機關、亦經安全撤退、現已形成死市、日軍佔領後、實一無所獲、又據另一報吿、謂現在戰事、在北門外之靑嶺、西門外之白虎山展開中、查定海雖無正規軍隊駐紮、惟自衛團隊甚多、亦有來自上海·川沙·南滙·方面之游擊隊、經縣府予以收編者、故定海游擊戰之實力、殊爲雄厚、日軍在定登陸後、將來之創痛必鉅、</p>
<p>穿山戒備</p>
<p>又據航業界消息、二十五日上午九時、鎭海又有日機十架侵入肆虐、投彈六十餘枚、但多落荒郊、故華方並無若何損失、至於穿山方面、因與定海僅一港之隔、自定海失陷後華方軍事當局、已在該處加緊戒備、</p>

<p>外商銀行不受約束</p>
<p>關於財政部之馬電限制提存辦法、外商各銀行並不受的束、於是有人深恐資金流入外商銀行、但據新聲社記者昨向銀錢業探悉、外商銀行存款、向無匯劃存戶、均係現鈔、惟利息較華商各銀行錢莊爲低、所有存款、以旅滬外僑及外</p>

<h3>日艦砲轟新港　日軍登陸未逞　遭華軍堅强抵抗終未得逞　日艦昨又駛往靈甸港騷擾</h3>
<p>揚子江下游海門縣屬新港等地日軍企圖登陸、日艦發砲轟擊、前日由滬駛往北沙輪船、臨時折回、咋農仍行試航、茲經大光社記者探悉各情如次、</p>
<p>砲轟新港</p>
<p>新港離日軍禁域之靑龍港僅二十餘里、陸地距三廠可十餘里、日軍司令部即設於三廠內、四週密佈鐵刺網、爲一極重要之軍事根據地、故華軍派遺　游擊隊伍三大隊、駐紥附近泰興鎭　玉龍橋等處、挖掘戰壕、佈置强固工事、駐三廠之日軍、迭行進攻、均被華軍擊退、於是日軍於前日（二十四日）上午、會同海軍、實施陸海會攻、先由日艦發砲轟擊、掩護汽艇上日軍、駛進港口、意圖登陸、砲彈中新港鎭民房、當起火焚燒、隱伏港口草叢中之華軍、沉着應戰、待日汽艇駛進火綫射程、即以密集機關槍掃射、日軍計不得逞、急行退去、仍回日艦、艦上發砲、作無目的之濫擊、</p>
<p>航輪折回</p>
<p>駛航北沙綫之德商遠東公司之海宜輪等、於二十四日駛抵靑龍港時、即遙聞砲聲、知上港門已發生戰事、但仍繼續前進、惟爲顧全客貨、恐生意外危險、乃於駛近新港口四里之海面時、掉頭折回上海、於當晚六時許、駛抵外灘碼頭停靠、英商太古公司之萬通輪、則由英艦一艘保護、照常駛靠靈甸港·三和港·東一號·等港、客貨概由划船駁卸進口、於昨日下午三時、載客駛回上海、避難旅客、頗爲擁擠、</p>
<p>各輪仍開</p>
<p>日軍前日進攻新港登陸未逞、於昨日（二十六日）上午、日艦突駛往靈甸港口外、向岸上發砲轟擊、彈落海灘及稻田、華軍當加還擊、遂起戰事、情况尙不激烈、昨晨遠東公司之海宣輪、福華公司之江定輪等、均照常開出、迄晚公司方面未接任何電吿、想已安然駛抵各港口、</p>
<h3>日方限制英輪駛汕　英領嚴詞拒絕　日僅允每週進口一艘　英表示不受任何限制　英海軍當局已令英艦護航</h3>
<p>外息、本月廿四日、日當局曾允商輪可自由出入汕頭、但昨日日方突稱嗣後每屋期僅允英輪一艘駛入汕港、英海軍當局表示、英商輪之駛入汕頭、不能受任何限制、至必要時、英軍艦將實行護航、現汕頭之英貨物棧前、均被日方佈置鐵絲網、阻止英輪裝卸貨物、又據確息、駐汕頭英領事、因日方企圖限制英國在汕頭之航運、已向日領提出抗議、略謂日方僅允每週有英輪一艘駛入汕頭、英方不能承認、若日方果欲干預英國之航運、則英海軍當局已令英艦「沙納特」號實行護航云、</p>
<p>太古怡和　維持航權</p>
<p>自日軍在汕　登陸後、行駛南華綫之各外商輪隻、曾遭阻撓禁止駛入汕頭、但英商太古怡和兩公司、爲維持在華航權、仍決定照常航行、太古公司之濟南輪、於廿三日、由英驅逐艦保護、駛入汕頭、但日方復橫加干涉、阻撓卸貨、當由英艦長史密斯少校、向日方提出嚴重交涉、船未卸貨、即行退出、</p>
<p>日方藉口　仍圖禁阻</p>
<p>詎日方前日又復通吿第三國航商、以防止外輪接濟華軍爲藉口、仍圖禁阻外輪駛汕、並稱入汕港之第三國船舶、如係輸送食品與信件予僑汕第三國人民、則須經檢查後方許入口、但據大光社記者向航業界探悉、英商太古怡和兩公司、對於日方通知將不予置理、</p>
<p>英輪續航　貫澈初衷</p>
<p>爲切實維持其航行權益計、仍將貫澈初衷繼續航行、二十七日由滬駛港之怡和大順康輪、二十八日由滬駛港之怡和日陞輪、太古之太原輪、二十九日由滬駛香港海防之怡和永生輪、及太古之四川輪、仍須兼灣汕頭、能吾入口、爲另一問題、</p>

<h3>交易均照新限價　米巿秩序趨穩　國米來源以蕪湖爲大宗　當局今日集議穩定米巿</h3>
<p>豆米市塲自經訂定標準米糧價格、所有一〇五家行號皆巳遵照辦理、故交易趨旺、成交數量見增、國米來源邇日略見增加、以蕪湖等地爲大宗、租界當局米糧管理委員會於今日召開會議、自訂定標準限價後、市民受惠匪淺、茲分誌詳情於决、</p>
<p>行號交易　遵照限價</p>
<p>自經工部局會同米業界領袖訂定米糧新限價不得超過二十一元、及米業團體聯席會議規定中决各米標準價格後、市塲交易已趨正規、秩序亦吿恢復常態、一零五家行號皆已遵照新訂限價、互相買賣、豆米市塲昨九時開盤、十二時收盤、情形愈見良好惟因囤戶復趨活躍、况納胃較旺、故普通厚薄粳較日昨提高一二角、此爲極平凡情事、不足爲奇者也，昨日上午、共成交八千包左右、</p>
<p>國米來源　蕪湖大宗</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨塲方面探悉、最近數日、因天雨終日、國米來源復見减少、惟其他產米區域皆因屢生波折、販運客商、採購鬆懈、惟皆連袂赴蕪湖蘇州等地採購、故以上二地米糧運滬者頗爲衆多、其價格咸在滬市米糧限價以下、故米業行號購得是項白米、仍有利可獲、昨日河下仍無到貨、車輪包子同里楓涇等帮裝滬米糧的二千包左右、此皆爲天雨所致、</p>
<p>當局集議　穩定米巿</p>
<p>兩租界當局對於界內民食、素極注意、惟目中日戰事爆發後、國軍西移、兩租界形成孤島、環境特殊、對於疏通國米來源、因產地皆巳淪爲戰區、勢所難及、日前米價暴漲、工部局鑒於食米爲貧富市民無一可免之每日必要物品、故召集米業代表、商訂限價、遏止漲勢、茲悉租界米糧管理委員會巳定於今日下午二時、召開委員會議、届時將討論力勸米業行號遵照新訂限價買賣、及加派人員馳赴市塲維持秩序、疏通國米來源、</p>
<p>訂定限價　巿民受惠</p>
<p>滬市米價、前因外滙暴縮、及天津鼓浪嶼事件發生、一般米業奸商、藉故乘機提高售價、一時漲勢頗爲兇猛、頭號白米由二十元漲至二十四元、影響小民誠匪淺鮮、後經當局出而干涉、迭决召集米業代表、商討遏止米業漲勢、並訂定最高白米限價每石不得超過二十一元、自新限價實施後、米糧售價即見回跌、並中决各米、亦經規定標準價格、故全市貧苦市民、受息匪淺、皆深謝富局及米業領袖之處置得當、爲貧民解除艱難、</p>

<p>行政機構</p>
<p>播敎事業、創辦不久、行政上尙少地位、但爲推動事業、又不能不確定行政地位、在中央由敎部延聘學者專家及有關係之部員、組織播敎委員會、專爲事業之設計及技術上之諮詢、社會敎育司、設專任村員兩人至三人、辦理行政及播音事項、在地方則由各省巿用敎育廳局自設播敎服務處、計則播音之推行、幷代各縣裝配及幷修理牧音機、按各該省市環境情、形分劃爲若干播音敎育區、每區由廳局委派、指導員一人、負督促考核幷指導播敎之進行、與技術上之協助、各廳局內、亦指定一兩科員、專辦播敎行政事宜、如此上下聯繫合力一致推行、事業實施較易、二十七年度起、敎部復設收音機技士辦理技術並指導各省收音事項、各省敎育廳、亦增設此項技術人員、辦理技術、並指導各縣收音事項、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙賣風仍未戢　中日商行不斷拋售</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛脾、仍無變化、暗盤情勢，因日商銀行界曁華行並外電印度銀公司等互相競爭猛塞不休、致市象續呈硬化、唯中途洋行男雖來扒結、但以外行頗肯塞出、故未蒙影響、結果英美均長、交易尙旺，至港匯初時頗鬆、後以外行賣意轉濃、而稍回軟、終則尙硬起二五、</p>
<p>印銀公司亦有塞出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均叉長一八七五、紐的銀價呆定、倫教生金亦仍未更動、滙兌英對美仍平、對滬大一五、對法則仍平定、美對英亦無上落、對滬漲一角五分、對法仍乏變化、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英匯六便士七五、美滙十三元一八七五、較之上週末、均無榮辱、開後因日商銀行界賣意頗濃、互相競塞不已、兼之華商各行賣胃亦健、致市况步鬆、計華行與日行相繼塞予滙豐·麥加利·華比現貨英金六便士七八一二五及八一二五迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大一分、計徵百分之二·七五、時華行賣興仍濃、再與印度銀公司競相賣予大通某行現貨美滙十三元二五及一二一二五、是以爲狀仍鬆、此後洋行界稍來扒結、並以賣者供意漸淡、致市勢轉平、計洋行結進匯豐。華比現貨英金六便士七八一二五、兼又購結某行現貨美匯十三元二五、將近午刻、英美滙成交轉稀、僅有港滙買賣、計華行廣東力塞予華商投機家現貨價爲四十五元六二五、狀况頗硬、迨午收銀行現貨賣價、英滙六便士七八一二五、美滙十三元二五、</p>
<p>英美港匯均見放長</p>
<p>後市首由美行大通某行塞予英行麥加利現貨英金六便士八一二五、繼之華行中南與華僑相繼吐予外行現貨美匯十三元三一二五、後洋行結進滙豐麥加利現貨英金六便士七五、兼又購結某行現貨美匯十三元二五、是以過程頗平、入後外行荷蘭售予洋行現貨港滙四十五元半、爲狀稍見回軟、延至晚收、銀行現貨實價、英金六便士七八一二五、美滙十三元二五、與午收相同、結果較上週末、英長〇三一二五、美硬〇六二五、港滙照成交價軋過、亦賤二五、茲將一天做開交易錄後、（英滙）</p>

<h3>外滙步鬆　金價稍挫　一天起伏　五十餘元</h3>
<p>昨日玥金烚赤暗盤市况、升降倏忽不定、全視雙方買賣　爲轉移、初開因承上日餘風、市勢頗形堅挺、開市即昂達二千五百七十元、開後雖錢兌業代散戶頻來拋塞、但因銀樓帮與某銀號吸力尙强、故價尙掙扎於六十六七元、十一時後某現金號突興賣風、且外滙內盤步硬、加以買戶均袖手觀望、故價不支傾跌、午收會降達二千五百十五元低盤、惟跌時成交僅三十南、後以買方趁低復來吸購、致稍回高、惟結果終因外滙鬆硬而較上週末軋跌二十元、交易略淸、全天的六百兩光景、銀梂飾金亦先漲後跌、結果掛小一元、海關金與中英純金等依然呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤跌小念元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開堅穩、首由某金號代投機商吸進錢兌業五十兩、價二千五百七十元爲開盤行情、較之上週末午收做高二十元、不久某金號即復吐予某銀號五十兩、價穴十八元、繼之錢兌業亦塞予銀樓帮三十兩、價則相同、後錢兌業互做十兩、價六十五元、未幾某銀樓互做五十兩、價六十七元、十一時光景、錢兌業實予某銀號三十兩，及錢兌業互做五十兩、價均六十六元、此後某現金號忽起賣風、同時外滙步鬆、故買戶多束手觀望、半小時後價頓硬撳小五十一元、某現金號賣予銀樓帮三十兩、作十五元爲午收價、收後買方均想趁低吸收、奈賣者巳無供意、致未成交、但價巳回高至三十元光景、午後二時開市、錢兌業互做三十兩、價三十元、繼之錢兌業進某金號五十兩、價三十二元、不久某金號又費予同業五十兩價三十元、時某錢兌業復來吸購、且金號止塞、故潛勢向上、一霎那躍起八元、某錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價三十八元、繼而又進同業十兩、價四十元、此後某金號賣意復萌、趁高力塞不休、故即轉下挫、某金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、價三十七元、瞬息又疲落七元、三時光景某金號吐予錢兌業十兩、二千五百三十元爲晚收價、結果較上週六午收軋跌二十元、全天五十五兀差度、現金號之本牌金照烚赤高十元光景、現標金照掛牌金低五十元、據詢均鮮少做開、</p>
<p>飾金先漲後跌</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初未更動、迨至十時十四分、因烚赤晨開頗堅、故亦掛大二元、後至正午十二時、因烚赤市勢傾疲、故乃回小三元、此後未見變更、結果軋小一元、計大同行改懸二百五十七元、新同行爲二百五十五元、收進二百四十九元、</p>
<p>中英純金不動</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價、仍呆定於一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金未更、計二元三角九分六釐、上海標準標金價亦未更動、仍爲一千二百零七元六角、乃二十四日倫敦電、英純金每盎司仍屬七鎊八先令六辦士所致云、</p>
<h3>貼現又昂　高開一百十元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、突又高昂、衝出一百元之上、每千元上午始終在一百元左右、下午再高至一百十元、較之上週又漲起廿元、錢業拆息仍平、上下午均掛二角五分云、</p>
<h3>朝鮮票缺　獨跳五分半</h3>
<p>上週六英純金與美匯兌續未更動、昨日本埠外滙、洋行結款頗殷、外銀行供給暢達、西商與日銀行供塞甚勤、市况鬆動、結果英滙爲六辦士七八一二五、較週六鬆零六三一二五美滙爲十三元〇二角五分、亦鬆零六二五、烚赤開盤、金號買意濃厚、較上週六做高二十元後聞滙票鬆錢兌業客戶供給暢達、市况虛弱、午收二千五百十五元爲最低價、午後客戶趁低吸納、市况稍堅、惟交易寥落、變動甚狹、晚收爲二千五百三十元、結果較上週六下跌二十元外幣英美金鎊供求尙盛、市價英降美升、英美余票交易甚暢、市價因匯票報鬆、俱趨下降、法郎票新加坡票等需要稀、而多下降、日金票供給未暢、市况尙堅、晚市爲九角九分五厘、朝鮮票缺貨、市價激漲、晚市爲九角一分五厘、較上週六激漲五分五厘、公會交易稀少、僅厚吉出鎭與進美金票一百元、昨日金鎊降二角、英金票降三角、美金鎊升五角、美金票降一角二分、法郎票降二厘、新加坡票降二分、斐律濱票降五分、德金票降一角、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債市塲</h3>
<p>待銀行結賬後　七月四日開市</p>
<p>公債暗盤市塲、前議暫停兩日、昨日本應照常開市、惟屆時仍因尙有種種困難、各公司交割手續、因銀行改訂新辦法後、押款及透支等戶、頓受東縛、致發生退票情事、因此引起糾紛、尙待理直、故又經全體同行議決爲維護同行本身利益計、及等待銀行界補充辦法正式公布後、再行開市、爰暫行停市、准於七月四日起照常開市、（即銀行結賬後開市之第一日）</p>
<p>衆業公所因交割頻繁、股票價格仍無變動、雖怡和股收盤買價十八元六角、但上午十八元九角曾有成交、橡皮股市似少興趣、但見有許多買戶出價蛟諸日前之價稍微、</p>
<h3>紗花　現紗廣帮辦胃獨健　同業買賣大為減縮　行情已回跌三四元</h3>
<p>棉紗現貨市塲暗盤交易、照常進行、且廣帮採辦益覺不弱、此貨均由裝運廣州灣轉輾運往內地銷售、市價得此實際交易扶植、紗價穩謐、同業互相買賣交易、大爲减縮、蓋以銀行錢莊旣不能透支、又不可做押款籌碼緊縮、殊難週轉、因此上下範圍　渺小矣、午後天雨綿綿、集會者允稀、生意愈淸、但市價不靈、降二三元、因需要匱乏之故也、查昨廣帮及同行成交統計的有一千包以外、行情比週末價跌三四元之譜、又今日出口棉紗有十四件運烟臺、</p>
<p>日紗市塲、耆日人頭之靡擠不開、熱氣騰騰、今則大見减縮、大槪因霉雨綿綿而驅散矣、據云二十支月琴本月份暗盤價做四百元至三百九十五元、午後未曾做開盤子、</p>
<p>停市前後之紗價比較表</p>
<h3>外棉交易　依然僵化</h3>
<p>業中正在討論付款問題印棉運到二萬五千餘件</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市開盤之初、因孟買來電報跌、南方現貨價格亦吿下落、又因週末之故、各方獲利了結者頗衆、故跌三五磅音、後雖經因利物浦來電良好而回高若干、結果收盤尙跌一至三磅音、印度速同預測跌一羅比、埃及停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、自政府頒令限制提存後、外棉交易頓形僵化、因法幣之難以換得、且日來外棉到貨擁擠、廠方有電令外國止裝者，亦有向賣方交割者、棉業公會前曾討論貨欵問題、而召開會議、紗廠聯合會仍於日前召開會議、因有數點宜愼重考慮、茲訂於今日中午在永安公司再度會議、滬上各外棉洋行亦均被邀參加、故各廠之對於今後棉款等問題、將於今日商討後定有一妥善辦法也、日來市上交易靜寂、俟金融商得善策後、即有恢復之可能也、</p>
<p>大英公司經理之Samtia號、由喀爾喀塔運來印棉三千九百噸、約有一萬五千餘件、已於前日（廿五日）抵滬、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸中、又該公司經理之Rahore號由孟買裝來棉花二千七百零七噸、的一萬餘件、大的後日（二十九日）可抵埠、</p>
<p>本棉交易依然絕跡、各廠號皆無成交、實以有貨旣短絀、各路來源早吿中斷、生意之稀、貴如鳳毛麟角、至於同業外棉成交亦較减縮、因付款問題艱難之故、昨日僅同行中成交一筆、美棉彭加浦六百件、價爲九十六元鈔票棧交、蘇北來源雖則凋零、然零星到頭尙不斷乏、碼頭上到通州花六百七十七包云、</p>
<h3>糧食　麺粉客銷沉靜　麥價降落五分</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨現粉市况、呆頓如故、雖届週初之期、客銷依然沉靜、蓋由於金融問題、尙無相當辦法、匯劃貼現、依然高昂、向售匯劃之客帮交易、一時勢難接近、是以南北兩帮、均吿停滯、僅本街日常需要之零批交易而已、二號粉悉售四元六角五分現鈔、市面前途、恐一時尙難開展云、今日有粉二千包運威海衛、</p>
<p>小麥　前昨新小麥來源、亦因金融呆滯、到貨不多、各粉廠進胃亦屬呆而不化、僅恃本街行號稍有問津而已、所以一部份執貨者、爲欲脫貨求現計、似較前爲遷就、聞崑山新麥續開一批、額計四百餘包、價爲六元六角五分、比上週末市盤則已修小五分云、</p>
<h3>西貢米新近定成三百噸　粳米下擋店銷活</h3>
<p>杜粳　各帮來源、河下無到、車輪包子到二千餘包、天時陰雨、人心復堅、本街店胃頗有動辦、不過都選廉價之貨、故如下段厚薄粳市頓見活潑、形勢殊緊惟高料貨去路有限、市况平常、故結果厚薄粳下段者起升一二角、高料守原盤、擊元平定</p>
<p>洋米　市上現貨枯乏、現西貢咋日仍喊二十三元、祇有數十句零配、惟據糧商確訊、昨日已經新定一批、數目不多、大的僅有二三百噸、倘滬市再昂而能通運者、或有續訂可能、價開二十一元、係一號西貢、的下月中旬後到申、</p>
<p>客秈　昨居定勢、除京蕪特高秈尙與限價差五六角未有出樣外、普通高貨均照限價售開、惟砶米有內地帮辦裝、高砶米提升一二角、杜洋尖埠尖供求相埒、未有榮辱、</p>
<h3>油餅　生豆油　無甚變遷</h3>
<p>豆油市塲、自受限制現鈔提存後、巳有五天無市、至昨日各業人心漸吿常態、油市處在困難情形之下、亦紙得做開、市况比端節假前無甚變遷、惟交易仍爲現鈔、付解貨款日期、由雙方言明訂定、時屬非常、暫不依照業規辦理、統市計開膠州花生油四百件、價三十四元、膠州豆油三百件、價爲三十三兀、烟歧豆油二百件、價爲三十四元四角至三十四元、天津聽裝豆油二百聽、價爲四十五元三角及四十五元、神戶來連豆油三十桶、價爲四十七元七角、去路除生油爲香港帮辦去二百件外、其餘大都是本街園坊銷塲云、</p>
<p>至豆油來滬、昨由靑島來一千一百五十件、又蔴油三百五十聽、亦由靑島裝來、又豆餅亦運到二萬九千四百零九片、</p>
<p>另有豆子一千四百七十七包、昨由天津裝來、而今日裝去則有二百包、</p>
<h3>糖市　片青漲元許</h3>
<p>昨糖市據外電微有上落、荷蘭近期鬆而遠期升、七月份爲荷盾八·三〇、九十月份八·五五、倫敎近期稍升、八月份爲七先令四便士二五、十二月份及明年三月份均乏更動、本市公會划盤現貨二四粗白本棧小一角、爲二十八元九角、外棧二十八元七角、轉口關棧貨升五分、以二十元五角半、成交二百包、太古車白升一角、西棧B嘜二十八元七角、CW嘜二十八元四角、CX嘜二十八元一角、DY嘜二十七元六角、HX嘜二十七元四角、H嘜車赤十八元六角、荷赤現貨二十元、轉口貨十四元、本白及一號冰均無上落、國糖有廣帮開出片靑三百五十餘包、較高者十二元次之十一元八角、比前升元許、南江靑一百十包十七元、昨由香港運來糖一千九百六十六包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　元肉看升</h3>
<p>桂元肉因近乏續到、而市上存底亦缺、又値現鈔高昂、市勢突趨緊佾、號方呌升二三元、再加升水暫時尙難合划、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布市面無法活動　退票糾紛猶未解决　定貨不能如期理楚</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨棉布市面、仍因貼現率高昂，無法活動、同業退票糾紛、猶未理淸、各方多感週轉不靈苦悶、致到期定貨咸皆未能照理、廠商處境允爲困難、人心惶慮、大有山雨欲來風滿樓之慨、惟本客交易尙有點綴、但售盤均見鬆弛、白貨組布細布每疋降五分至一角、怡和組布現鈔價如後、十六磅雙象　一五·九〇十四磅一鹿　一四·九〇十四磅三鹿　一四·九〇十三磅九天　一三·九〇十一磅三兎　二·八五九磅五幅　一〇·八〇</p>
<p>客銷粵滇帮進意尙佳、辦富貴等牌細布百餘包、又色布色斜花嗶嘰府綢色丁二千餘疋、溫台帮辦零星拚件色貨數十包、本街辦粗布三十餘件、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>白貨仍無市面、惟龍頭細布有小額暗盤成交、的一二十包而巳、每疋價爲現鈔十四元三角、聞洋行對於廠方之到期貨、因無現幣、將以滙劃照市升水、以便交解、而同業與同業間買賣、如何交割、則迄未有具體辦法也、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日疋頭出口、十件運威海衛、三十七件運烟台、十一</p>
<h3>絲茶　輯里絲尙有做開</h3>
<p>國外絲市、紐的星期停業、橫濱絲價轉向上升、計現貨晨開一一六〇元、漲十五元、遠期一〇九五元、漲十一元、下午收盤現貨一一七三元、叉漲十三元、遠期一一〇九元、漲十四元、故本週國外絲價、可望好轉、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、因繭運受阻、不甚活躍、二旬來甚少鮮明氣象、昨洋行略有吸購、絲價因滙率關係、內外雙方頗易接近、奈陳貨不多、新繭未來、於此新陳不接之期、前途隱憂旣多、交易自難暢達、咋計英法進廠經輯里經五十担、印莊進輯里下干十担、絲價均稱良好、而白廠因漲風過高、故昨日市價不及輯里經之動人注意、蓋輯里經銀魚等級售開一三〇〇元、誠堪稱劃一時期之記錄云、二十四日有湖絲四百五十四件、絲頭五十二件運歐洲、</p>
<h3>綠茶外銷仍旺</h3>

<h3>浙茶管理方法</h3>
<p>— 馮和法</p>
<p>去年財政部貿易委員會奉命辦理全國茶葉統銷，爲戰時農業政策樹立之初基。本年爲使茶葉之產製運銷，獲有根本之改造，財政部呈准行政院頒佈各省茶業管理機關組織通則，使各省成立之茶業管理機關與貿委會取得聯繫，以作進一步之推進。浙江省於本年三月間成立油茶棉絲管理處，由建設廳與各中央機關合作，各部內容間有不同，茶葉方面即與貿委會訂立貸款收茶合的，責成管理處茶葉部辦理產製運輸各方面改進事宜，處長由建設廳伍廳長自兼，費鴻年劉寶琛兩先生分任副處長，委由本人主持茶葉部事宜。因茶葉統銷爲抗戰以來最見成效之特產，在貿委會鄒秉文吳覺農兩先生主持之下，對於茶業整個之改造以及對於抗戰之配合，早具詳盡之計劃，浙江茶業管理即遵旣定方針，參酌當地特殊情形，逐步推進，大概情形，略述如次：</p>
<p>（一）四大目標</p>
<p>戰時茶業政策，目標有四：一曰爭取物資，爲動員物力之一部，其目的在不爲人用，並使原由私人操縱之散漫力量，得能集中。二曰增强金融，換取外匯，亦即爭取物資之具體內容，此需政府統籌運銷，增加出口，始克有濟。三曰安定農村，增加茶葉生產，以富裕農民經濟，平衡各層利益，健全茶農組織，此不僅爲戰時經濟政策所要求，亦係促進民衆組織之方法。四曰根本改造整個茶葉生產之體系，以爲抗戰建國之一端。蓋在平時，欲圖茶業之改進，阻於人爲困難者指不勝屈，常此戰時，社會若干惡勢力，隨戰事而消逝，亦正茶業之抗戰建國之機會也。</p>
<p>（二）四種步驟</p>
<p>戰時茶業政策之推進，依生產之步驟分如下四階叚：一曰，改良生產，增益農民。現茶農之秤植茶樹，揀製毛茶，均極散漫簡陋，不明技術，雖似主因，實以山價旡有保障，獲利不易，飢寒足虞，自難擴充生產，改進技術，故問題關鍵，在於如何維持毛茶善價，不受剝削。二曰健全茶廠，改進製造：良以今日各地之茶廠，不僅簡陋，且多迹近投機，時製時輟，絕無較久遠之計劃，此因運銷機構未能合理，市塲無保障，有以致之。茶廠受之於中間商人者，必轉嫁於茶農，層層剝削，勢必同歸於盡。三曰减少居間，取消陋規；原有買辦性之代銷茶棧，勾結洋行，壓迫茶廠，陋規重重，名目繁多，茶業衰落，實階之厲。四曰直接貿易，增加出口，此爲商品性農產淤後問題，無銷納市塲固遑論茶業改進，然如不能直接貿易，仍受制於洋行居問，則殊無法以推廣市塲也。</p>
<p>（三）管理原則</p>
<p>茶葉部之工作，無非爲完成戰時茶業政策所示之目標，執行上述之工作，然其因係地方與中央合作之機關，性質如何，啟人疑問，用將吾人工作之方針，簡單釋之曰，一爲推行中央之統銷政策，因此爲茶業政策之根本，無統銷，無從以談「爭取物資，增强金融」之目的，亦無山以成「减少居間，取消陋規」，以及「直接貿易增加出口」之工作。二爲維護本省農商之利益，惟有農商利益之增進，殆能使其對於茶業之愛護，進而對於國家民族信仰之增進，所謂「安定農村改進茶業」之基礎，亦基於此。維護之道，決非盲目之推動，而亦係生產各階級層間利益分配之調整，如此始能言改良生產，增益農民，健全茶廠，改進製造」。三爲盡量爲本省茶業改進而服務，蓋就吾人所知，管理行政，決非對人民僅作消極之限制與的束，而爲積極之推動與帮助。茶葉部本身雖直接間接不負業務經營之責任（如收購等），更不收任何之費用，然上秉中央統銷機關之囑託，下就本省農商之需要，均當以服務之態度，代爲辦理各種有關茶業改進之事務，初不以行政機關，以消極之工作，自　於一端。</p>
<p>（四）幾種任務</p>
<p>根據上述目標，茶葉部工作內容，至爲繁複，本年草創之初，籌辦忽促，自難全部執行，惟下列諸端，則均將次第推進，務求有所成就：</p>
<p>（一）推進茶農生產——此不僅祇指毛茶產製而言。茶業政策之目標，一方面固求大規模現代式茶廠之實現，他方面更求生產關係之單純與合理，在未能發展國家資本，使全部茶廠現代之前，茶農精製箱茶，以增進其利益，實爲當務之急，其方法即爲推行合作組織。財政部頒佈各省茶葉管理機關組織通則，列茶農合作爲主要工作之一部，本省有合作工作隊擔負是項任務，故茶葉部祇須與之密切聯繫，共同推進，即可見功。</p>
<p>（二）平衡茶葉價格——此爲茶業改進問題之中心，一方面在保障茶商合理之利潤，另方面爲提高茶農之利益。前者工作較易見效，其法即與貿易委員會訂立保障茶價合的，組織評價委員會，公平協議，務求茶廠所得，有正當利潤。後者工作最關重要，然茶農過形散漫，較難奏功。本年計劃乃先決定毛茶之最高最低及平均扯價，限令商人現款收購，爲防止壓價壟斷計，茶葉部商同中央貿委會於各茶區，成立毛茶收購處，依規定價格收茶，如商人願出高價競臃者，聽其自然，如此農民利益必可提高，前以消極限制，未能見效之問題，均可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>（三）調劑茶業金融——欲農民改良共生產，茶商改良其製造，必先使其資金充足，運用自如。此當戰時，金融週轉較難，農商自籌，不無問題，茶葉部特向買委會商借茶貸資金，低利貸放，本年預計，當在三百萬以上。茶用材料方面，爲免除商人採辦困難及成本過高，亦擬以法定滙價，大批購入，作爲實物貸放。</p>
<p>（四）健全茶廠設備——爲健全茶廠之組織，並取締其投機，於茶季之前，特舉辦茶廠登記，規定其必須之資金及設備等項，開業以後，並派駐廠管理員負責督導，以期健全設備改進產製。並接受貿委會關於海外市塲所需各種茶類花色之意見，交由各茶廠參考遵製，以期達到供需適度有計劃生產之目的。</p>
<p>（五）調整倉運組織——戰時倉運爲當前茶業之重大問題，積極方面爲求速運，廉運，多運及倉儲之安全，消極方面爲取締走私偷漏，特於各重要地點，設立茶葉倉運站。並登記茶葉倉運業，以便統籌管理。</p>
<p>（六）發展研究訓練——茶業改造各方面，有待研究者殊多，茶葉部就力之所及，均當决第進行，然茶政之推行，端賴人材，故於健全幹部人材之訓練造就，尤當注意。蓋是項人村，不但須具有茶葉產製技術之充份學力，且於整個茶業政策，需有充份之認識，並能爲公忘我，堅苦奮鬥，如此，則中國茶業之改造，庶幾有望。</p>
<p>（五）組織概况</p>
<p>茶葉都設三課，分掌指導，金融及倉運事宜，已有職員近一百二十人，任駐廠管理者的五十人，倉運站者的三十人，分區主持貸款事宜者的二十人，本部及各辦事處，人數頗少，各技術人員多係浙省各機關調派借用有共同性工作之人員在五六人以上者，均以考試徵用方法行之，如驻厂管理等工作人员，並予以相當时期之訓練後分派之。內部工作均與本處各部分工，關於茶葉改進各項，均與其他有關機關聯繫，工作詳情，另有計劃書報吿。關於茶政理論，巳草有「戰時茶業政策論一申述之，以就敎於各先進。</p>

<h3>中國醫學藝術論（四）</h3>
<p>— 張鳳</p>
<p>哲理方面</p>
<p>現在姑且撇開藝術不講，遠遠地待我來講些中國醫學的治療原理的根據或導源。凡一種學衛，言說必先於事績，而言說之前，先有哲理。或者要疑我在這里不怕頭痛，講玄妙的中國醫學的哲理了。那不要害怕，哲理有玄虛捏造的，也有實騐得來的。玄虛的哲理固然可怕，不要提起。實騐的哲理，倒很名貴的。</p>
<p>人家都說中國醫學的哲理，根據祇是陰陽五行。按陰陽與五行，截然是兩事，其學說之發生，陰陽在前，五行在後；一見於易經，一見於書經；一是象，一是數。書經洪範篇之五行說，我們耶不用考據家之辦別眞僞來說，即相信確爲箕子所陳，早落在易經陰陽之後，易象但有陰陽而沒有五行，故五行爲後起之說，又被秦漢的方士僅量利用，滲布於中國的一切學術之內，弄得烏烟瘴氣，不僅以醫學爲然。考其實在，在五行學說發生的或前或後，還有一種數的觀念。這個觀念支配於政敎人心，較爲實用。不象五行說之滑稽突梯無何不適用，卽無何適用。說來甚長，我們即在此處縷陳其例子罷。</p>
<p>宇宙觀　　六合　上下四方</p>
<p>政治部分　六官　天地春夏秋冬　　又　　　　六府　水火土木金穀</p>
<p>軍旅　　　六軍</p>
<p>宮殿　　　六宮</p>
<p>學術　　　六家　儒墨名法陰陽道</p>
<p>又　　　　六藝　禮樂射御書數</p>
<p>又　　　　六經　易詩書樂禮春秋</p>
<p>易象　　　六爻　初一三四五六</p>
<p>詩義　　　六義　賦比興風雅頌</p>
<p>禮制　　　六禮　冠昏喪祭射軍</p>
<p>樂律　　　六律</p>
<p>又　　　　六呂</p>
<p>文字　　　六書　象形指事會意形聲轉注假借</p>
<p>繪畫　　　六法</p>

<p>親族　　　六親　父黨三世母黨三世　　畜牧　　　六畜　馬牛羊鷄犬豕　　醫學　　　六府　胃大小腸膽膀胱　　又　　　　六官　眼耳口鼻前後陰</p>
<p>又　　　　六因　氣血痰食蟲積　　又　　　　六氣　風寒暑濕燥火</p>
<p>又　　　　六症　表裏虛實寒熱</p>
<p>又　　　　六經　陽明太陽少陽厥陰太陰少陰</p>
<p>又　　　　六法　汗吐下溫淸補</p>
<p>又　　　　六脈　寸關尺（左右）</p>
<p>上引這六數的觀念，普遍于宇宙人問及一切政敎學術，是實在的，巳實用于周代文化極盛的時候。其導源在上下四方的宇宙觀，是立體的，較五行說之宇宙觀，僅是平面的爲勝。所以當時朝廷上下採用此六數以具數備用。但是，此六的數目，總關是不周延的，總有盈不足的缺憾，故祇好說是偶湊，强湊的湊數，反觀五行說可以有生有尅，可以循環無端，理與數能亂說循環的境界再與事相牽合，方士們便「得其所哉」地廣泛的應用到物質方面去，聲色味上面去，而獨佔優勢甚至應用到有關人命的醫學上面去直到如今，不亦悲乎！</p>
<p>我們知道五數的觀念是玄虛的，六數的觀念尙有盈不足的缺憾，然比較尙有實用，故當時儒家控制的禮樂刑政以六數的大概來支配形以下的事物，勝於外來的（？）五行說多多。</p>
<p>回到本題，在醫言醫，醫家究竟是實際的事務，有生死的出入，一味五行的玄說在當時巳不能支配，於是在象中勉强湊足風寒暑濕燥火（左傳）應用實用六數以彌縫五行之缺，再取六腑以補五臟之缺，乃成十一數，太奇零了！又補上一個腔　的三焦，湊成十二數，於是有十二經之說。可憐呀，當時的讀書界與著作都不甚高明，文章雖好，神思有的不淸。十二經被他們一一按實，按實之後，便生障碍，不能同通廣泛了。試看古醫書的傷寒六經，時賢有發見其不與內經十二經相合，留下了這個破綻，於是有傷寒病及足經，不及手經之疑。近人乃有傷寒六經之名稱，乃係代名詞之說法。</p>
<p>按六經之名稱，顯然係由象及數之過渡說法，謂寬泛地一種病理系統的代稱，尙無大病，若必以贜腑一一按實，則阻碍橫生了。</p>
<p>六經數字之由來，以陰陽二象，加四小象而成，係聯貫下來的，不是縱列的，其象如下：</p>
<p>够了够抽象了，不要管他，橫堅五行說六合說都是配不上提携到現代哲學的講壇上去，，只有六氣或六淫一說似乎與醫學上適够成爲誘因的條件。不錯一大體上的不錯！風寒暑濕燥火，人們生活在這個大氣當中，比衣食住行一樣有關係，任何人不能否認。至誘因之數何以不多不少而適成爲六。則很難置答，我們併少之可以爲四，加多之亦可成爲多因，祇當時的學術界喜以六的成數，偶然湊足此六個誘因的數目罷。論其大體，則可與西國醫史Pythagoros　（B.　T.　580）之土氣水火，乾溫冷熱·血·粘·黃白胆汁及Galen　（131）之動物精，養生精，天然精，所謂液體醫學者相比，即與近世之內分泌學說亦有並行而不悖之處，倒也可見中國古代醫學的實騐哲理之並非無據，並非荒謬，而且有意思，勝於五行之說多多。至論其小節，則中國醫家在歷時期中都有繼續不斷的推闡與貢獻，因中國的著作家，尊崇經傳的心理，每有貢獻，都援「箋不破注」的例，不從事修芷，但事加入，奪讓古人的學說專美於前，後來的歷史祇得蔭庇着前人餘光，而照耀於曼曼永夜之中。</p>
<p>疾病常識</p>
<h3>傷寒淺說</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>什麽是傷寒</p>
<p>這傷寒症的名詞，是借用舊的通俗名稱。照西文或新醫學理上講起來，實在是不通得很。因爲這是腸內受着一種替夫斯菌的傳染而起急性的熱性病。與寒氣的傷害毫無關係。不如改爲腸熱症或腸替夫斯病爲妥。但爲要貢獻新知識於一般普通讀者起見，暫用這個名稱以作過渡。</p>
<p>病原菌</p>
<p>這種病是以發熱，脾腫，薔薇疹，腸管症狀，和神經症狀爲主徵的病變。病原菌是從口內混食物而進入腸內的。遠種病原菌，在一千八百八十年愛勃晚氏所發見，而經科和氏加甫基氏確定的。是一到二密克倫（千分一耗）長的桿狀菌，一端有鞭毛，能營活潑的運動。同類中有甲乙副替夫斯菌等四種。</p>
<p>這種病原菌，在人體外生存不久即死。而在人體內可以長時生存着，故病後的人體內，，往往可以發見這種病菌，並且能反複傳染給他人或自體再發。</p>
<p>瞻囊和骨髓中，能長時使這種病菌生存脾腎和腸中在某時期中存在而跟着尿糞一同排泄到體外。</p>
<p>腸熱症傳染方法</p>
<p>用手處理生魚，生豆腐時，手指上往往染着這種病菌而誤黏於食物上進入腸內。最爲危險。蒼蠅的飛集於食物上面，傳染的機會更多。</p>
<p>身體內部的條件，和病的感染很有關係。少量的病菌，在健康的胃中可以殺滅。又即使已侵入體內，也能由血液的防禦作用，而阻止他們的繁殖。祇有胃腸抵抗薄弱的人，或全身抵抗力薄弱的人，纔被侵襲。</p>
<p>傳染腸熱病的季節</p>
<p>腸熱症的流行季節，在陽歷八九月間最盛。因為這時候外界的溫度和蒼蠅繁殖的極盛時代，最適合於病原菌的繁殖和廣播。水災兵災等時，衛生的秩序紊亂，所以傳染的機會也最多。年齡以十五歲到二十五歲之間較多。男子更多。</p>
<p>腸熱症的病狀</p>
<p>這種病原菌侵入人體內之後，一定要經過二三星期的潛伏期的潛伏期，纔發固有的病狀·初期症狀，以惡寒戰慄開始。戰憟的情形較稀少。發熱早降夕昇逐日像梯形的步步昇高。但也有忽然達最高點而停留不退的。病人訴頭痛，不眠，食慾缺乏，口內乾燥，煩渴，舌帶汚苔。脾臟腫大，在第一星期之來發見的居多。</p>
<p>到了第二星期皮膚現薔薇疹，發熱稽留不退。腹部隆起，迴盲部雷鳴，有壓痛。</p>
<p>第三四星期時，發熱弛張不定，漸漸退熱。全經過中主要症候是薔薇疹，脾腫，無慾狀的面貌，譫語，遲脈，支氣管卡他爾，皮膚乾燥等。其危險的合併症是心臟衰弱肺炎，腸出血，腸穿孔，脚氣，出血性等。此外有褥瘡，腮腺炎，腎膿瘍，腎炎等症候。</p>
<p>腸熱症預後的吉凶</p>
<p>凡有腦症狀，心臟衰弱等台併時，是非常危險的。腸出血肺炎，腸穿孔和褥瘡等，都是可怕的。</p>
<p>治療常識</p>
<h3>治療肺炎之觀察</h3>
<p>— 顧不問</p>
<p>經過血淸治療後　死亡率减少百分之五十</p>
<p>今有醫學上甚饒興趣之事，卽爲治療大葉肺炎（LobarPneumonia）之法，巳有新發明之途徑，向前進展。但此並非治療小兒癱瘓中之呼吸困難時，所謂「鐵肺」之奇觀，乃是醫學一種眞正進步之治療術也。</p>
<p>肺炎流行於世界文明諸邦，影響於人類者至鉅，乃爲嚴重性傳染病之一。卽以英國孟楷司脫Manchester一地而言，在一九三七年之肺炎病案一二六八件中，死亡者竟有四二〇人之多。男子感染此病。每較二倍於女，不論老幼，均易普遍傳染，且有特殊致命之勢。允以嗜酒者及妊婦，一目罹此，更爲危險。</p>
<p>肺炎症狀，突然進襲，當即胸痛異常，口吐濃痰，陷於强烈之血毒症，立即發生譫妄。同時，溷積肺內之分泌物，逾量分泌，以致呼吸困難。患者常因氧之缺乏，以致本身肺液之消沉，卒至死亡。</p>
<p>在昔有關肺炎之學說，以爲肺炎之自然趨勢，乃非藥物所能影響，蓋藥物旣不能减縮其趨勢，月復徒勞無功也。今者，此說方慶其證騐不謬矣。蓋在近代自有特效之種簇血淸問世後，肺炎病案中之死亡率，大爲减少，而且患者豫後，亦多佳良也。（未完）</p>

<h3>勗中性的雜誌</h3>
<p>— 尙卿</p>
<p>現在上海的雜誌，似乎可以歸納起來，分成三類：一類是積極的，不畏　，不畏險，竭力推斷着抗戰運動；一類是消極的，只談風花雪月，供人酒後茶餘的消遣，說不定還含一些麻醉人的毒素在內；另一類則專談一般的社會問題，各種修養或　問，介紹一些普通的科學知識，如果是文藝的，則登些唯美主義的以及身邊瑣事的文章，旣不觸及抗戰大事，也不妄登無聊惡札，這就是我所說的中性的雜誌。</p>
<p>積極的雜誌，吾無間然，除了希望牠們苦幹下去，沒有別的話。可惜這類的雜誌，爲數很少，現在更有日漸凋零之感，這是使我着急的，因此我更希望牠們在數量上會增加起來。消極的雜誌，那不容說，自然希望牠們愈少愈好，一本不出爲最好。所可惜的是，事實上這類雜誌似乎正佔着最多數，我們應該怎樣來對付牠們，這裹來不及講，只好留待後來。惟有中性的雜誌，爲數也不少，牠們處在可以積極或消極之間，因此我就不能不本着我的赤忱來勗勉牠們一些。</p>
<p>主持這種中性雜誌的諸君，當然是有苦心的，他們的苦心是足以使人諒解，更足以使人欽佩的，因爲他們並沒有忘去文化人的責任，却因爲限於環境，所以不得不在他們認爲妥善的途徑上努力。然而我以爲他們還該將步子稍稍跨大些，盡量利用着可能的機會來爲抗戰服務。</p>
<p>我們不一定要在文字上攻擊對方，才算達到爲抗戰服務的目的。我們儘可以竭力提倡我們的民族意識，發奮人類固有的抵抗精神，來完成我們的志願。因此，以言取材，我們可以利用我們的歷史，也可以利用各國民族的復興事實，來曲曲達出我們所要說的話。再說得具體些，宋末明末的忠臣義士，以及波蘭捷克等的興亡事實，都是絕妙的材料，論文可以寫，詩歌可以寫，小說允其可以寫。同樣，一般性質的雜誌可以從事於此，而文藝的刋物允其可以從事於此</p>
<p>即使在一般的取材中，我們也可以偏重在軍事方面，來增加一般人的軍事知識，因此，要談科學，不妨注重軍事科學，要談經濟，不妨多談軍事經濟。我想這比了專談普通的衛生常識或不著邊際的家庭經濟之類，總要更加有些意義吧。至於文藝的描寫，以目前的戰事爲題材，還有什麽不好呢？何必拘拘於個人的遭遇或感嘆呢？</p>
<p>不錯，這樣一來，雜誌中的文章或者要八股化，趣味要减少，而使讀者不歡迎。可是我以爲文章的要吾八股化，完全是技巧問題。宗旨確定了，用各種技巧來發揮，就不會八股化。吾則即使內容多所更轉，而技巧平庸，還不免於八股化。因此，讀者的是吾覺得有趣而予以歡迎，也就在技巧的能吾使人滿意。何况我本來說是「注重」和「多談」這些積極的事項，並非說是全書都應該用這些事項，其中也儘有斟酌伸縮的餘地，總不要像現在若干中性的雜誌，對於道些事　　　不提就好了。</p>
<p>我現在的確看見了若干這樣中性的雜誌，一般性質的和文藝的都有，允其是由什麼公司或商號津貼而以廣吿收入爲主體的雜誌。牠們的內容，可以說無懈可擊，因爲牠們並沒有顯然反動的地方；然而牠們一毫不觸及現階段的時局，允其不觸及我們全民族正在作生死存亡的搏鬥的大運動。假使有人說，牠們是有所受意的，存心要冲淡我們的抗戰意志，我想牠們也將無辭以對吧！因爲要表白牠們的態度，是不必辭費的，只要牠們肯盡量利用着可能的機會，來鼓動抗戰就是！可是爲什麽他們却不肯來利用呢？</p>
<p>我願這些中性的雜誌，都會走到積極的道上去。只要你們肯，我相信你們一定能！只要你們能，我保證你們一定會發達，因爲我們的讀者，正有着這樣的期待！你們奮發起來吧！</p>
<h3>寄懷鄉病者</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>我緬想着有這麽一天。</p>
<p>離開了家多年的遊子，把一段悠長的歲月，消磨與艱苦，蓬斷的霜晨，黃塵的阡陌，曉月殘星，荒墟野店，在馬上，在渡頭，在夢中，團圞的燈火，家人圍坐在爐邊，或是在豆棚瓜架，完結了一天的工作，那池塘，那村邊的古樹，小鎭的伽藍，愚夫愚婦的瑣聞軼事，家傳的灰老古屋，屋中一家可愛的氛圍，你都會惦記着。當多年的鄉思把一個人磨成抑鬱時，常你第一步提起脚跨上回家征途時，當你拋撇開鄉土，堅決了不撓的信心，薪死奮鬥着，你事業成功之後，你回到熟知的環境中去也許你感傷，你流淚，但你不能自已的還是幸福的重逢。</p>
<p>你還記得，你遠征時，你把勇敢的手壓住鄉愁，掩盡了忸怩的兒女態，投向視國的懷抱中，走上陌生的征途，在黃沙的高原上，在萬山的重疊中，在四季多陰的平隰，在滄江峽石間，佈滿了流亡的一羣。從遠方來，每人有一段遠方的回憶。那失去的遠方，使人惆悵回戀。隔絕了遠方，再捕捉那遠方。捕捉那烟，那夢，那舊國，那靑山。</p>
<p>你忍苦，爲了捕捉，讓未來的歡笑換來艱苦的流離，讓鄉愁換來光榮的報捷。你忍耐：遙念，捕捉那遠方，從絕緣中構成幻想。每人都有他們的遠方，胡馬依北風，越鳥朝南枝，江南人愛芳草，塞北人愛牛羊，看窮巷的晚炊，有人想起蚊雷時的板屋，高山大澤中的猿啼，有人想起茅榭池塘間的蛙鼓。</p>
<p>不僅是你自己的，你的遠方，你思念塞北，你思念江南，你該知道，還有千千萬萬人的家山，朋友的家，祖先的家，歷代祖宗的陵墓，士地芬芳的氣息。離別自然是哀歌，但重逢却更幸福。</p>
<p>像夢，像童話，像更生，你把一段鄉愁的砂土搏成一粒，你縮地如費長房從流居再歸成你的土著，聽到許多無辜者遭難的故事，完好的房屋總成灰燼，屠戮，勒逼，愚昧，詐欺，造成人世間未有的悲劇，也許不幸者就是你要好的親朋，也許房屋的燒燬就有你的一份，你不能不悼惜，你命運的空白，離別中的滄桑。但你畢竟是幸福了。隔絕了遠方，又捕捉來那遠方。離別可悲，但重逢却更可喜。</p>
<p>你的家在那兒？你塞北，你江南。爲了你有更大的事業，你間關地走遠了，在馬上，在渡頭，在夢中，你遙寄一段鄉愁，與大江，與歸雁，與白雲，與明月。</p>
<p>捕捉那遠方吧，舊國靑山將爲你含笑。你江南的芳草，你塞北的牛羊。</p>

<p>經上說：『我們都如羊走迷，各人偏行已路，耶和華使我們衆人的罪孽都歸在他身上。』今大的經文似乎響應了咋天的經文：昨天的經文說：「因爲世人都犯了罪，虧缺了上帝的榮　。一那末人若犯了虧缺上帝的罪，而不去解决，不去向上帝求和，他勢必無顏朝見上帝，就此遠離上帝，像羊越走越迷；有人迷入煙酒賭博，不顧傾家蕩產。有人迷入逍遙作樂，不惜光陰蹉跎。有人迷入美色，不保人格墮落。有人迷入名利，不以己有爲足。有人走人邪敎，不睛東假從眞。一朝奔入深山幽谷，無法自救，到那時正所謂：「天堂有路不去走，地獄無門闖進來：」悔之晚矣，看哪！今天的經文乃是忠吿世人快些懸崖勒馬，信仰基督耶穌作救主；因爲主耶穌曾經宣吿牠的使命說：「我是好牧人，好牧人爲羊捨命。」意想說，他爲了愛世人的緣故，情願捨去自己的生命，去尋找迷途亡羊，直到找着，負祚肩上回來，合家歡呼，耶穌說：一個罪人在地上悔改，在天上的使者也要一同歡喜快樂。諸君：你是不是迷途之羊嗎？主耶穌在呼呌你；小羊，回來巴！小羊，回來吧！（待續）　　上海基督教文字佈道會。郵箱一二二七上號</p>
<h3>燒赤鏈蛇（下）</h3>
<p>— 明枝</p>
<p>——老奶奶的故事——</p>
<p>『被咬死的很多；被咬傷的允其多，眞正可惡透了！然而牠們被我們打死的也很不少。我們一看見牠們便打，』滔滔地說下去，『一看見這些渾身火黄的東西便打。有時牠們實在來得多，來不及打，就等一下，等牠們稍稍散了開來再打。打死了便用麥殼麥桿將牠們一燒，燒得牠們無影無踪，連灰都不存。你知道，不這樣燒，牠們腐爛了的骨頭都是有毒的，狗吃到了都要發瘋的…。』</p>
<p>『這個我知道。』挿了一句，表示他的博識。</p>
<p>『近來不曉得爲什麼，』她還是說下去，『本地雖然不生赤鏈蛇，却也時常會生出一些白花蛇，灰禿蛇出來。眞正討厭，牠們和着外來的赤鏈蛇，攬得人家不能安穩過日子。這樣的蛇我們也巳經打死了不少…。』</p>
<p>他們還要談下去，他看見屋子裏的人都出來了，就走過來，到「他們裏面去。似乎有人和他嘰咕了一會，他又厲聲喊着說：</p>
<p>『老婆于，過來，還有話問你！』</p>
<p>老奶奶知道這是什麽事，就不慌不忙走了過來。</p>
<p>『你家裏還有什麽人？』那人聽了身旁的嘰咕聲板着面孔問，神氣和方才大不相同。</p>
<p>『還有兒子和媳婦。』安靜的回答。</p>
<p>『他們那裏去了？』那人向身旁嘰咕了一陣，又問。</p>
<p>『兒子到靑鎭去糶麥；媳婦在娘家。』</p>
<p>『你家裏好像有許多人住過的！』</p>
<p>『是的，前幾天田裹忙，多僱了幾個工人。』</p>
<p>『靠不住！』</p>
<p>她不作聲，因爲她覺得無話可說。</p>
<p>接着又問了一陣，她揀可以回答的，就回答幾句，不可以回答的，就不作聲，聽由牠去。</p>
<p>在比較多幾聲嘰咕之後，「他們」都立起來準備走了。</p>
<p>『老婆子，當心：假使你們這裏有「土匪」，人都要殺死，房子都要燒掉的！』</p>
<p>這是臨別贈言。老奶奶不理，只不動聲色地目送着「他們」走出村去。等到「他們」走得遠了，看不見了，她就喊：『阿明，去拎一桶水來。』</p>
<p>在火滅烟消之後不久，王明源隊長帶着我們都下山來，回到了我們原來的地方。因爲我們知道「他們」的老例，一他們」下鄕兜一個圈子，要常天回到靑鎭，決不會折回來的。</p>
<p>王隊長一看見塲上的灰，便說，『可惜，浪費了一些燃料。』</p>
<p>『這沒有什麼可惜，』老奶奶笑着說，『要是有眞的赤鏈蛇給我燒，我連屋子拆了下來當燃料也是願意的！』</p>
<p>在這樣一句詢問之下，老奶奶便說出了方才的一番對話。</p>
<p>『對，這簡直是惡毒的赤鏈蛇，虧你想得出！』我們也都笑着說。『我們以後的工作，不必用什麼別的名稱，呌作『打蛇』就是了。』</p>
<p>『你們打，我燒，』老奶奶用竹帚掃着灰，帶着愉快的神氣說，『打的打，燒的燒，燃料不够，我的老骨頭拚了也不耍緊！』</p>
<p>我們又恢復了打麥的工作，同時，更談淸此後「打蛇」的工作。</p>
<h3>懈怠</h3>
<p>— 恝栔</p>
<p>朋友，我常聽得你說過：「沒有退後，沒有休息。」何况你巳經踏上了眞實的道路。</p>
<p>寂寥，苦悶緊緊地包圍着我們，差一點兒就要窒息死了。我們過着牢獄式的生活，儘量地呌喊怨嘆，但有誰會來憫憐我們，釋放我們？</p>
<p>我們至少不曾掩面哭泣，更不曾把握着死將來臨；我們一心一意要找羣一條出路。</p>
<p>雖比不上猛獸的出柙，也可算是到展翅的小鳥，自由的天空任憑飛翔。道路是找着了，我們已開始踏上，什麼都將不難實現過程也許是苦的，但這是新的降臨。我相信有無數的事物可使我們鼓舞興奮。朋友，你似也曾這樣地想過吧！</p>
<p>我不懂你爲什麼要屢屢回顧，牢獄式生活値得什麼留戀？美滿物質安適地享受，朋友，那是鴆藥！</p>
<p>你又遲遲不前，雖然你不承認這是退後，是休息，然而你懈怠了，你的精神將頹唐下去，再也無從收拾起。</p>
<p>永遠過着奴隸安適生活的人們，正向你招着手。我明瞭，他們誘惑了你。但我們曾呌喊怨嘆過的啊，你難道就此忘了？</p>
<p>你的意志也許正在交戰，也許你巳決定轉向歸途，你的行勳巳如此的懈怠。朋友，請你認淸一下子吧！</p>
<p>我們旣踏上了眞實的道路，我們何忍中途分離，携起手來前進呀！</p>

<h3>「安全運動」服務記</h3>
<p>— 竾仙</p>
<p>奶奶娘姨們都說我們不識字　特種居民提了鳥籠高視闊步</p>
<p>六月二十二日，為着安全運動，我被派在四馬路廣西路轉角服務。</p>
<p>在未出發以前，校長先生特地召集我們，除發給一塊臂章，一桿小旗，和幾十張傳單以外，對我們還有一番簡短的訓話。</p>
<p>我於八時二十分到達指定地點，剛逢着Office　Time，汽車連頭接尾的由跑馬廳駛來，同時行人也特別多，從小菜塲歸來的奶奶娘姨們。大筐小籃地邊走邊還要和同伴談話，他們往往三四個人並排走在一起，因此總有一兩位離開人行道走在馬路邊，他們喞喞嚷噥地講着話，非到車子開到脚跟不肯罷休。我特地將傳單散給這些人，然而她們大都是拒而不受，有的說我不認識字，有的說這東西我不知看見多少了，可惜安全運動所印發的傳單，幾天來就祗這一種，圖畫旣不甚動人，字句也欠通俗，尤其因為沒有顏色，以致連孩子們也不感興趣！——可是我們知道，十件車輛肇禍案中，犧牲者至少有七件是無知的孩子。</p>
<p>近九點鐘，提鳥籠的上海特種居民敞着褂子由跑馬廳絡繹而來，他們挺胸突肚的行路姿勢，使對面來的婦孺們不得不避道而行，然而即在婦孺們的脚踏在馬路邊的時候，不是前面衝來了汽車，便是黃包車夫在後面狂呌着讓路。但是特種居民依舊高視闊步地向前走着，有時還特　以屁股橫撞着旁邊的女人，或者更回過頭來望着受窘　猙獰地笑。</p>
<p>我說：「先生，請你走路不要扠着胳膊。」</p>
<p>「怎麽！走路還講究個樣兒麽？」他依然高視闊步地向前行進。</p>
<p>四馬路的路面，自「肫肝大王」以達廣西路口這一段，狹窄得只能容兩輛小奧斯汀來往，然而在這段路以東，有着小菜塲和有名的靑蓮閣；小菜塲於十時一過，來往的人便很少了，惟靑蓮閣却整天有很多的人進出，此外還有若干茶室酒樓，望垣對宇地排列着，婚喜慶弔的車子，因而便不斷在這條路上來往。這段路之西，除同樣的有許多酒樓外，更有大羅天和天蟾舞臺兩個戲院，開鑼及散戲的時候，便不辨車在人縫中開或人在車縫中走！像這樣一個擁擠的路口，單憑一個警捕兩個手臂自然不足以保證「安全」了！</p>
<p>提到警捕，在我短短的服務時間內，便發現許多缺點，第一他縱容擺象棋攤的在人行道上聚賭，雖經我的請求而不加干涉，後來我們幾個服務的同學堅持着要他去驅逐，他這　懶洋洋地和棋攤旁站着的一個穿黑印度綢長衫的漢子耳語了一會，棋攤便即撤去，這眞令人莫明其妙。其次，他的指揮交通，好像於汽車特別寬容，有時汽車還在跑馬廳口，他便不顧佇候在廣西路兩頭的人力車及自由車，因之廣西路兩頭的車輛便愈聚愈衆多。</p>
<p>為着平望街的被封鎖，由四馬路到五馬路的人，便不得不繞道廣西路，因此廣西路行人激增。我以為上海近來車輛肇禍事件之所以特別多，由於行人及司機者的過失，固然不少，然而最大的原因，還是為了馬路的面積未能容納這樣多的人和車！所以在這樣的情形下，單靠消極的舉辦安全運動，事實上不會收到完美的效果，而若干里弄通路的開放，其有裨於行人安全者定較我們在烈日下鵠立幾天為多！</p>
<p>可是就當前的環境而論，上海人所遭逢的安全的威脅，固有甚於車輛之肇禍者，然而這似非發幾張傳單貼數紙標語所能解决的問題；當我於服務後疲憊地經過福來飯店門前時，恍若有若干輛汽車，正預備吞噬我的血肉之軀似的！——於是我感覺到工部局這一次舉辦安全運動，實予我們以另一種有力的啟示：『我們如果茍「安」，我們難望瓦「全」』！</p>
<h3>華德路監牢囚滿為患</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>比歷史上任何時期為多　看來有繼續增漲的趨勢</p>
<p>有一個囚犯為了戒煙故意犯罪入獄</p>
<p>華德路監牢——這世界最大的監獄，又打破了紀錄了。現在裏面的囚犯總數，不下七三七七人，比較它歷史上任何時期的囚犯為多。五年來，這監獄裏的囚犯不出七千人；戰時，它的總數確實减低到四六七四人，但過去幾月來，囚犯激增，不多幾天以前，又達到七千人的數字，並且看來繼續有增漲的趨勢。</p>
<p>華德路監牢很有名，所居的囚犯也稠密，有很少數的囚犯，犯了微小的罪行，為的是要到裏面去住上數星期。上星期有一椿案件：一個囚犯承認他是故意入獄的：原來這人有鴉片癮，感到痛苦，要戒絕而不能，他的朋友們吿訴他犯些小罪，押進華德路監獄，保證他的確可戒絕毒癮，因此，這人便偷些東西，被判處徒刑三個月，現在他正在戒煙，據監員說，他可戒除煙癮的。</p>
<p>一九三二年正月，華德路監獄裏有六七四五個囚犯，都是華人，外籍囚犯不在其內，因為他們在厦門路西牢裏，但幾個月之內，華德路監牢達到它歷史上任何時的最高囚犯人數，計有七二五一人；其後雖有多多波動，但已减低，有的已赦出，或是附有條件地開釋。歲月如流，一九三七年的戰事到來了。戰時，釋出的囚犯很多，原來還要開釋更多的囚犯，但這個計畫停止了。砲彈擊中監獄，曾斃死幾個犯人，押進去的囚犯比較的少，所以人數　跌到四六七四人，這是十月間，戰事快移　上海區時候的事。</p>
<p>然後，人數又開始逐漸增高，但據數字看來，不致再到以前的高水準。自一九三二年，這監牢已擴大，添設外籍囚犯部份，替代厦門路的西牢；現在的華人囚犯七一四〇人，雖比以前的最高紀錄要少，但連外籍囚犯一一一人，和感化院裏的一二六人總計起來，有七三七七人，已是這監牢歷史上的最高囚犯紀錄了。</p>
<p>這種情形，不是始料所及的，本年初，牢裏的華人共有六三一二人，監牢當局根據可能的罪案增加而佔計本年裏的囚犯最多不出七千人，但現在已知道估計錯誤了。因為罪案增加（這在工部局的警務和訴訟報吿上可見到），結果監牢裏的囚犯數超出預料。自本年三月份起，繼續增加，沒有間斷，只是每星期杪開釋囚犯，　沒有押入的，人數　始减少些。</p>
<p>現在的囚犯總數裏，包括有已處死刑，在等着處决的囚犯二十五人；無期徒刑的七十九人；徒刑十五年以上的二百人；十年以上的五六三人；七年以上的九〇二人；五年以上的七六一人；三年以上的六八二人；二年以上的五二四人；一年以上的八八六人；半年以上的一二〇七人；三月以上的八二八人；二月以上的一六七人；一月以上的一四六人；　天以上的一六九人；還有一個囚犯，沒有判决。（譯自英文大美晚報）</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　勸學務農儲材為國　留强汰弱選種有場</p>
<p>何儷玉道：『我要請問公公，這裏自由村，除了我們此刻想籌辦織物廠之外，也有別個工廠，在此地開設嗎？』朱村長道：「有的！你們若是開這個織綢廠，却是第三個了。本來我們當初組織這自由村的時候，是不預備人家來開設什麽工廠的。因為我們舊時那個村落，被敵人燒光了，房屋旣一點沒有，田園也荒蕪了。所以到戰後，我們規畫了一帶地方，從新做起。我們這些人，本來是種田的，現在仍舊種田，從前的許多田，還有的是為田主所有，租給人家種的，分出什麽業主佃戶之類。也有幾家富農，他雇用了長工，用了人家的勞力，所有收穫，都歸他有的。到了戰後，實行了以前孫中山先生所說的話：「耕者有其田。」再沒有什麽業主佃戶之分。本來我們這裏種自田的多，有幾個大田主，死的死了，窮的窮了，還有的因為他做了叛國的事，充公的充公了。因此所有田地，都歸村有，而種田的人，組織了集體農塲，各盡其力，各收其利，分配也尚算公平。承他們舉我做了村長，我是沒有什麽學問的，也不過憑我的良心做事罷了。當初我們只想恢復我們種田的舊業，此外我們要一個學堂，因為種田人不識字，覺得太苦惱了。到此地來設立工廠的事，我們不曾計算在內。而且村中有幾位守舊的老先生，不願此地有工廠，他們說：「工廠」一定有工人，這些工人，或是從別地方來的，一定良莠不齊，壞了我們自由村的善良風紀。」這些話，果然可笑；但是一個地方的工廠，却是與這個地方上，很有關係。最初的時候，也沒有想到自由村來開市工廠，到近年來，中國的工廠，漸漸發展起來了。幾個大都市裏，已經實不能容，便疏散到各鄉鎭來了。到了前年，便有一個蠶種製造塲，開設到我們這裏來。這個製種塲，是江蘇省農業局辦的，因為他們原來的幾個製種塲，所出的蠶種，不敷分配，又辦了這一個製種塲。這個製種塲，也是第十三個製種塲了。那些製種塲，雖然養蠶不多，但他們也要選擇相當的地方。而且他們自己不及種桑，也要選個桑田最好的地方。」（一四七）</p>

<h3>孤島劇話（上）</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>送毛迎言</p>
<p>毛世來二度來一般世字輩師弟兄，出演黃金以來，大紅大紫，盛況空前。遒者世來與黃金之約，已屆期滿，即日凱旋，繼毛而來者，是「音韻獨步」「譚派正宗」的言菊朋。</p>
<p>毛世來者番南來，可謂出足風頭，蓋世來之藝，確已進步不少，學荀已臻化境，北返後，開荀　生將收世來為徒，世來之藝，學荀可謂恰當，期能不驕不懈，好自為之，則　生有傳人矣。</p>
<p>此次隨毛同來者，紅了個高盛麟，黑了個沙世鑫，盛麟前次來滬，本不為人注意，者番嗓音大佳唱唸做表，武工架子，均有進展，學楊小樓，亦有三分像，能受台下人歡迎，非無因也。北方武生人才，小樓以下，極少佳品，盛麟能再加磨練，他日必能估一席地。沙世鑫之失敗，在於無嗓，不善討巧，致未能配上海人胃口。其實世鑫之戲路，非常規矩，身上亦稱得起好看，吾人殊不能以目前而斷定世鑫之終身。世鑫切勿以「發黑」而灰心，要知有「發黑」始有走紅，觀乎盛麟前次之不受人注意，今番竟然大紅，即是一例，世鑫其勉諸。</p>
<p>除沙高外，與世來配戲之江世玉，艾世菊，要為高品，世玉之小生，有一股書卷氣，且文武不擋，　稱葉盛蘭後之一人而已。艾世菊之丑，好在不討厭，做戲能不過火，觀其演「南界關」，更覺帶有三分崑腔氣，身上相當不錯，求之在北方丑角中，尙不多得，馬　祿不能及也。目世菊能文能武，亦屬難能可貴，隨毛同來諸人中最值得贊美，他如　盛戎，貫盛習，是皆世字輩之師兄，年紀大了點，玩藝兒當然精了不少，盛戎盛習，固已成器之人矣。</p>
<h3>上海難民救濟協會主辦　慈善茶舞競賽大會</h3>
<p>— 辛士</p>
<p>七月一日起名舞星出動作榮譽競賽</p>
<p>大上海在淪為孤島，空氣極感沉悶之下，關於消極方面的救難運動，是每個人所應做的工作，許多彈性女兒們，每天在爵士樂聲中與霓虹燈光下盤旋着，看樣子她們雖是滿面歡笑，全像不知亡國恨的商女之羣。但在實際上的情形，那樣婆娑應客笑靨迎人，可說是她們生活的本職，與應有的態度，而她們對於一切公益事項，固亦當仁不讓，未廿後人。如舉行話劇義演，和協助募款等等，以前早就盡力不少，曾造成幾番較大的優績。</p>
<p>上海難民救濟協會，為謀人盡所能並使舞女羣得有效力機會起見，經它們屬下的舞塲組勸募委員會發起，準備聯合各舞塲全體舞星，舉行連績一個月的極盛大的「慈善茶舞競賽大會。」日來在向各方面分頭接洽之後，全都為此聞訊欣然，感到絕大興奮。而所有各項辦法，因亦迅即商定，並定下月一日起始，就得一體動員，大舉從事了。</p>
<p>茶舞大會地點，決定假座仙樂舞宮。日期自七月一日起，暫限一個月。每天定下午三時起，至八時止為舉行時間。舞票特印福果券一種，每券一元，一券三舞。此項福果券，分每本十元，五元兩類。日內即行發售，預請各塲舞女熱忱認銷。關於舞女之支配，由每家舞廠，指派優秀舞女三十名至三十五名。以七天為一期，每期分七組，每組於星期一至五日各派四人，星期六及星期日各派五人。採用混合組織法，使各家紅舞星，平均參加，好似「名角大會串」一般，每天不同的來上一番總集合。會方對於熱心參加之各舞星，定有褒獎辦法。除置備各項榮譽錦標，及獎狀，謝獎外，並將由該會各類商業之同業組，分向各大商店，各家國貨廠徵集大量贈品，先期借定地點公開展覽。俟茶舞大會結束，舉行閉幕盛典時，用以分贈成績優良之各舞星，留作光榮的紀念。</p>
<p>為救難而娛樂，這娛樂才眞够味。而在一般熱心的舞國姊妹羣，這又正好是　為　胞效力的機會。同時她們在成績上同作全滬舞星第一名，和每一舞塲優星第一名的競賽，更和無意識地「舞國選舉」截然不同。因為一切全為救濟難民，那是一件很光榮的事舉，而也正每個人都該唯力是視的良心工作。故於此番一月期間，在全國舞星總動員之競進下，結果定下十分芙滿，是為難胞造福無量，是決可穩操左券的。</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>臥雲居士的墮落與李多奎的上進</p>
<p>多奎以老旦正式出演時，　照例須拜一位老旦師傅，彼時以臥雲作梗，未得師事老費，遂出陸五介紹都在羅福山的門下。及他　譽北返，又曾屢往津，濟，太原，各地出演，聲譽日隆，句銀日增，家境才漸漸充裕起來。同時他這人倒也純孝，無論在外面掙來多少錢，統統交給他老父保管，每月除不得已得酬應外，只拿六七元的零用錢。他雖是內行，然而他極喜歡同外行人交朋友，尤其對於有學識的人，更愛親近。倘他對於某劇的戲詞，有懷疑不解的地方，他總要向人請教，求人家講撥他聽的。他平日的裝束，非常文雅，絕無內行惡習。生性極愛搜藏名人書畫的扇面，現已保存百件以上。在老蘭未死的前數年，也　正式收他列入門牆桃李。以上所述，皆是十年來多套日益求進的實情。我們再看看那位較他成名在先的臥雲居士呢，他在最近七八年中，却相反的面日形退化與墮落了。北平梨園慣例直到現在還是無形中排擠外行，臥雲雖已正式下海過，但他性懶貪玩，又不時常出演，平素和內行又不甚往來，除數年前曾與菊　兩度合演過，以後就壓根看不見他的行踪啦。後來有人傳出消息，說他四年前姘識了一個人，這位太太手裏稍微有點積蓄，故而他就隱藏起來，髣髴是從此謝絕歌壇，永不業伶啦。他的嗓子因為不常調的緣故，幾年前就壞得一塌糊塗，唱不出來了。（四六）</p>
<h3>巴黎新興的連環舞</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>曾經流行於上海的新型交際舞「倫勃斯」，本發源於倫敦，而在紐約光大。因其易學有味，男女老幼，都很愛好。繼之而起的，還有所謂「蘋果舞」「洋傘舞」。都仿這種滑稽格式。據六月初在巴黎舉行的第十四屆「萬國舞藝大會」，則又發明一種「連環舞」（Roll-skip），即將取倫勃斯而代之云。</p>
<p>這環形式較別種舞步尤為奇妙突兀。處女公開表演，一度曾在法京幻術大廳舉行，由巴黎名舞家露塞妮及西蒙一女士表演，成績甚佳。發明此舞的，即參與舞藝大會競賽各選手，凡三十名家，為世界業餘舞術冠軍英人華滋華斯，及萬國職業跳舞冠軍納爾頓諸人等之集體創作經公認為美妙之極。不久當召集諸舞迷公開投票決定其是否為「舉世最曼妙之舞」，然後推行於世云。</p>

<p>紅豆館主西園　侗氏為海內唯一名票，生旦凈、丑、、文、武、昆、亂）無不精通，而於崑劇尤廣博淵沈，時人羣以崑曲大師稱之，近以疾寓滬瀆。深居簡出，日以詩文自娛。前日遇之於友人處，閒中談及此次本埠難民救濟協會同鄉組的　　之義務戲唱大軸戲者之蕭明女士略歷，詎知蕭明女士乃紅豆館主之弟子，繼而深詢之，館主曰：</p>

<h3>Shantou Landing: Japanese Troops Plan to Advance by Land and Sea; Chinese Army Deploys to Defend on Two Fronts; Japanese Troops in Donghu, Chaoyang, Intercepted and Unable to Advance Further; British Docks Blockaded, Coolies Unable to Unload Cargo</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Military sources report that the war situation on the Chaoshan Railway line is developing in China's favor. Due to difficulties in fighting near Anbu, the Japanese army detoured to attack Xintang, where fierce battles are still ongoing in the vicinity. Other sources indicate that the Japanese troops landing in Shantou intend to advance by land and sea. The land route advances along the railway line, with Chaoan as the temporary target. The sea route takes advantage of rising tides to threaten Jieyang via the Han River. The Chinese army has deployed separately to defend rigorously. On the Han River front, Chinese and Japanese forces are currently facing each other across the river. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A telegram from Shaoguan reports that Chinese reinforcements are pouring into Chaoshan, resulting in a stalemate. In the Meixi area, Chinese and Japanese forces are facing each other across the river. The Japanese troops in Huyang and Shuhu were intercepted by the Chinese army and are unable to advance further. The Japanese troops in Sijiwei, Shantou, are besieged and struggling. The Japanese army's plan to invade Chaoshan and open up the Fujian-Guangdong route has been thwarted. (Special dispatch, 26th afternoon)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A telegram from Chaoan reports that Japanese planes reconnoitered along the Chaoshan Railway on the 26th and dropped bombs. Hecao, Fuyang, Wuyang, and Fengxi were all bombed. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The situation in Shantou remains chaotic, and conflicts between the British and Japanese continue. After the British naval authorities sent the Jinan and Fusheng ships into Shantou under escort, the Japanese side immediately protested. They then erected barbed wire fences around the British docks, dispatched troops to guard them, and strictly inspected pedestrians. Goods were also not allowed to be transported into the docks. This blockade has significantly impacted the food supply to the port. Although traffic between Hong Kong and Shantou can still operate under the protection of British warships, there are still few ships sailing, and due to the unclear situation, coolies have dispersed, making it difficult to load and unload goods. Furthermore, there are few passengers and goods being transported to Hong Kong, so most ships are adopting a wait-and-see approach. In addition, many Chaoshan trading firms in Hong Kong are now seeking alternative trade routes. (Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to sources here today, regarding the recent order by the Japanese navy that all foreign ships sailing to Shantou must follow the Guangzhou method and are subject to severe restrictions, with no more than one British ship per week allowed to sail to Shantou, the British Consul in Shantou has protested to the newly arrived Japanese Consul. He also indicated to the Japanese side that if Japan attempts to arbitrarily interfere with the actions of British ships, the British navy will use warships to protect merchant ships. Shantou is currently relatively peaceful. Furthermore, the Bund outside the concession is fully guarded by Japanese soldiers, who do not allow Chinese people to board British ships. The British Consul in Shantou also raised this point in his protest letter to the Japanese Consul. Moreover, the Japanese naval authorities have notified the British side, stating briefly that the Japanese side reserves the right to search British ships arriving in Shantou, but the British Consul stated that the British side has ordered its navy to protect British ships at all times. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Today, British officials here declared that Japanese troops have erected electrified barbed wire fences around the British docks in Shantou, effectively blockading Shantou. Although British ships are still allowed to enter Shantou harbor, the erection of barbed wire fences around the docks has made it impossible for coolies to unload cargo. The British warship "Saneit" and the American warship "Pittsburgh" remain in Shantou. The British warship "Reconnaissance" returned to Hong Kong yesterday. It is said that the situation in Shantou is quiet, and the Chinese army has not yet launched a counterattack against Shantou. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Shaoguan: When invading Shantou, the Japanese widely propagated that Shantou was the hub for remittances from overseas Chinese, with remittances through the city reaching 200 million yuan annually. Therefore, the invasion of Shantou was necessary, etc., to cover up their ambition to expel British and American commercial forces and militarily threaten Hong Kong. This reporter specifically inquired about this matter with an authority in the financial circles of South China. According to him, this kind of Japanese propaganda is nothing more than an attempt to fool Europeans and Americans, reduce the world's attention to their invasion of Shantou, and deceive overseas Chinese, cutting off the livelihoods of their parents, wives, and children, thereby inflicting a blow on millions of overseas Chinese. The annual remittances from overseas Chinese to Shantou are only 70 million national currency. The Guangdong Provincial Bank has branches in Chaoan, Meixian, Dabu, Xingning, Tikou (northeast of Meixian), and important counties and cities in Guangdong and Jiangxi, as well as in Singapore and Hong Kong. The bank can also handle remittances to other provinces on their behalf. The Guangdong Provincial Bank has a well-established reputation, and remittances between Southeast Asia and the interior of Guangdong Province can be handled by the bank. This kind of ignorant propaganda by the Japanese only exposes their futile efforts. (Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Chaoan: The Japanese troops in the Lianji area, after being repeatedly and severely attacked by the Chinese army, are confined to the Donghu coast and have made no progress. The Chinese army in the Sijiwei area is still guarding Chencun and Xincun. The Japanese launched several fierce attacks, but all failed. (Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources tonight, after the Chinese army successively arrived in the suburbs of Shantou, the Japanese troops there are at a loss. After the Chinese army captured Anbu, it is now continuing to advance south along the Chaoshan Railway. The Japanese troops in the Dahao area are now unable to advance. At the same time, the Japanese troops in Meixi, near Anbu, have been completely annihilated by the Chinese army. It is reported that the Japanese troops invading Shantou are the 204th Division of the Japanese army stationed in the Guangzhou area. (Associated Press telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Nationals in Tianjin Repeatedly Insulted; British Public's Indignation Intensifying; If Japanese Side Does Not Accept the Just Demands, Public Sentiment Will Force the Government to Take Action; Ambassador to Japan Re-Meets Japanese Foreign Minister to Negotiate; Cabinet Members Waver on Retaliatory Measures</h3>
<p>(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that British people are greatly angered by the news from Tianjin that Japanese officials and soldiers are subjecting British nationals to barbaric and insulting treatment. The London authorities are paying close attention, given the intensifying indignation of the British people. It is expected that if Japan does not give a satisfactory response to the proposals submitted by Britain to Tokyo, including a frank discussion of the disputed points with sincerity and immediately stopping the incidents that Prime Minister Chamberlain has declared intolerable, then British public sentiment will force the government to take action. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times today commented on Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Cardiff on Saturday, hoping that his remarks to Germany and Japan would be heeded by those countries, and stated that Chamberlain has clearly stated that Britain's Far East policy will not be dictated by others. Chamberlain still hopes that the Japanese government does not condone the atrocities of its soldiers, but in any case, the British government cannot tolerate its expatriates being subjected to such disgraceful treatment without taking appropriate retaliation. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Tianjin incident is currently being commented on by various newspapers here in succession. The tone has become more optimistic, and it is said that there is a possibility of resolving this matter locally. The Financial Times reported, "The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, met with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Hachiro Arita, again on the 24th of this month. It is said that he will submit a report to the government authorities today. Yesterday evening, the government appeared to be more optimistic, believing that although the Far East is still fraught with crises, it is not impossible to conduct formal negotiations with the Japanese authorities. As for the basis of the negotiations, it is still unclear as of last night. In short, the government authorities have ordered Ambassador Craigie to declare to the Japanese government that Britain's interests and prestige in China must be maintained. It is now believed that the Tianjin incident can still be resolved locally. In the event that Japan adheres to its prejudices, what actions should Britain take? This question was also submitted for discussion by the Cabinet before Ambassador Craigie's meeting with Foreign Minister Arita. Cabinet members initially strongly supported the idea of economic retaliation, but after repeated consideration, they all agreed that the main objective of British policy is to limit the scope of the dispute, and that adopting economic retaliation would be counterproductive. Therefore, they changed their approach and considered naval demonstrations as a more effective measure." The Daily Telegraph advocated taking a tough stance, stating, "The German Propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels, delivered a speech yesterday, praising the atrocities of the Japanese troops in Tianjin ordering British nationals to strip for inspection with insulting and provocative language. His country's Nazis have subjected German Jews to barbaric acts, and now they see the Japanese military atrocities and think that their path is not lonely. It is not surprising that they regard it as an ally. Prime Minister Chamberlain has repeatedly declared that such insults are intolerable, and British public opinion unanimously agrees with the Prime Minister's words. However, the Japanese authorities may deliberately embarrass Britain. Goebbels has declared that the British government will be powerless. He does not know that our country's military preparations are becoming increasingly adequate, just as the Prime Minister said, we have no fear of coping with future events. However, in terms of various events in China, it is not difficult for us to have confidence, but it is difficult to deal with them calmly. We are willing to discuss reason with rational nations. As for nations that have lost their reason and are determined to act arbitrarily, misinterpreting our rational appeals as weakness and indecision, it is dangerous for us to continue to discuss reason with them. At this point, we should not pressure the government to take certain actions at a certain time so that our voices can be heard by other countries. Regarding this, everyone with a sense of responsibility knows it. However, the government's policy of resisting aggression and opposing hegemony has been unanimously supported by the whole country. This is something that all officials should understand. If we have already decided on a position and then shrink back, the disaster will be far greater than taking a firm stance." The Times reported that the government still hopes that the Tianjin incident can be resolved locally. However, if Japan expands the scope and demands that Britain assist in wrongdoing, there will naturally be no room for compromise. Conversely, if Japan's demands are limited to the extradition of the four Chinese involved in the Cheng Xigeng case, the British government is still willing to negotiate with them. (Havas telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister's Response to Questions from Parliamentarians</h3>
<p>(London) Before answering several questions from parliamentarians regarding the Tianjin situation in the House of Commons today, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated that the treatment of British nationals should be stopped immediately, but he did not want to say more, as this would hinder the hope of reaching a satisfactory resolution with the Japanese government. Foreign Minister Lord Halifax has made strong representations to the Japanese Ambassador, Mamoru Shigemitsu, on the issue, and Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, has also made similar representations to the Japanese Foreign Minister, Hachiro Arita. Discussions are currently underway with all parties, and he has reason to hope that these discussions will lead to a resolution of the Tianjin case. Labour Party leader Clement Attlee asked whether the solution the Prime Minister hoped for also included the broader demands made by Japanese spokesmen and whether the Japanese government had opened up these broader demands. The Prime Minister replied that the Japanese government had not done so. Former Foreign Minister Anthony Eden asked whether the Prime Minister's better hopes arose entirely from contact with Tokyo and whether the local situation had seen any improvement. He asked whether the Prime Minister had noticed that the promises of Tokyo could not always be fulfilled as hoped. The Prime Minister replied that he was well aware of this point. The hope he expressed referred to the talks with the Japanese government, and he hoped that the Japanese government could restrain the members of the Tianjin government. Conservative MP Milner asked whether the Prime Minister's policy of patience and moderation was in danger of being misunderstood in the Far East, just as it was in Germany. Milner also asked whether it was not worth declaring the implementation of effective economic retaliation in order to avoid a conflict that could lead to war in the Far East. The Prime Minister replied that he had taken note of all that had been said. He hoped that Milner would be as patient as possible in the circumstances in which we now found ourselves. Before making these remarks, the Prime Minister stated that there had been no change in the food situation in Tianjin, and that fresh perishable goods were only arriving in the concessions intermittently, accounting for only 10-20% of the usual amount. Tugboats and barges were being searched, causing considerable delays. The Municipal Council and the military authorities were constantly reviewing the food supply issue, and the government had ordered them to take appropriate measures as circumstances dictate. Few British nationals were passing through the barriers, and regrettably, they continued to be subjected to insults. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee will meet tonight to discuss the Tianjin situation. A report from Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Tokyo, on the attitude of the Japanese government towards the Tianjin case is expected to reach London within days. Regarding the British government's current plan to conduct a naval demonstration in the Far East, inquiries with the relevant authorities indicate that ships are available for deployment at any time. However, it is claimed that unless the ships have overwhelming power, sending them to the Far East will not achieve practical results, and consultations are still being widely sought. The Financial News today carried an article stating that the British government is repeatedly delaying, not knowing what benefits can be gained. The whole world is now watching the competition in the Far East, and if we cannot uphold our position, British prestige will plummet and be difficult to restore. It should be known that the time for reconciliation has now passed. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Blockade of Tianjin Concession Tightens; Difficult to Transport Food; British Military Trucks Also Encounter Difficulties; British Military Authorities Had Previously Informed the Japanese Side That Suspending Food Supplies Would Be Considered an Act of War; This Move Has Caused Great Concern Among a Group of People; Incitement Continues to Occur</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Three more incidents occurred today in which British military trucks transporting food were blocked, causing great concern among the general public. It is said that when the Japanese side issued its declaration of a blockade of the concession, the British military authorities informed the Japanese side that suspending the food supply to the British military would be considered an act of war. The first incident occurred at 12:50 p.m. today, when two British military food procurement trucks that had left the British concession in the morning and were returning to the entrance and exit at the southern end of Racecourse Road, wanting to enter the concession. One of them belonged to the British military and was carrying a British military officer and a British soldier as the driver. The other was borrowed from the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and was also driven by a British soldier and had an officer on board. All four were wearing military uniforms but were not carrying weapons. The Japanese troops there firmly refused to let them in. When Major De La Mare, the commander of the British garrison in Tianjin, heard the news and rushed to the scene, the Japanese officer in charge there had just left. After 50 minutes of discussion, the two armies were finally allowed to enter the concession. At 3:15 p.m., Lieutenant Simmons of the British military and eight soldiers were traveling in a truck, attempting to exit the British concession from the southern end of Racecourse Road to purchase cattle for the military's food supply. They were blocked from passing by Japanese troops. After the British military authorities received the news, they immediately telephoned the Japanese Consulate General. The personnel of the Japanese Consulate General promised to find a way immediately. More than 10 minutes later, a Japanese sentry with a piece of paper asked where the truck came from and where it was going. Lieutenant Simmons wrote on the piece of paper, "From the British concession, going to the Racecourse." The Japanese sentry then reported on the phone for a long time and brought back a piece of paper, asking when the British military truck would return. Lieutenant Simmons replied, "Between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m." The Japanese sentry then reported on the phone. At this time, Major De La Mare also heard the news and rushed to the scene. He discussed with the Japanese officer in charge there in Japanese for a long time before the truck was allowed to pass. The truck was detained there for 45 minutes. The British military purchased a total of ten cattle. When transporting them into the concession, they were allowed to enter without difficulty. Only a small amount of food was transported into the concession today, and the supply of milk was even more critical. At the same time, incitement continued to occur within the concession. Shop owners who had relationships outside the concession were warned not to continue to supply foreigners with food and were threatened with harm to their relatives and friends outside the concession. The supply of coal within the concession is also gradually becoming scarce. The supply of coal dust is still sufficient, but the supply of lump coal used in kitchens is about to run out. Tianjin Chinese are currently hearing two rumors about the possible future developments of the blockade of the concession. Some say that the blockade will be even more severe starting on June 30, when only Chinese people with special passes will be allowed to pass. Others say that the blockade restrictions will be greatly eased starting on June 30, and that the blockade matters will be handled by the "Provisional Government" of Peiping. It is expected that the "Provisional Government" will send the "Mayor" of Tianjin to negotiate with the British authorities to resolve the matter. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Protest to Britain over Insulting British Nationals in Tianjin; Tasiro Sends Note to British Consul General, Claiming Newspaper Reports Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese people who hosted news reporters today, Tasiro, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, formally sent a note to Jameson, the British Consul General, this morning, protesting that British newspapers and news agencies deliberately exaggerated and distorted the facts about the situation in Tianjin, and fabricated news of insulting British people. They also claimed that this situation not only expanded the current situation in Tianjin but also hindered the reputation of the Japanese military and consulate police. The note asked the British Consul General to persuade the British nationals to change their arrogant attitude and restrain the British newspapers and news agencies. If the British side did not pay attention to this protest and the British nationals continued their atrocities and the British newspapers and news agencies continued to report distorted facts, then all the consequences would be borne by the British side. The note also mentioned the news released by Reuters about the incident of Mrs. Finterle being insulted, and asked the British Consul General to pay attention to the arrogant attitude held by the British nationals who intentionally attempted to cause disputes. Today, when hosting news reporters, someone asked about the incident of Mrs. Finterle being forced to undress. The Japanese military spokesperson solemnly denied the possibility of such an accident occurring, claiming that it was contrary to the instructions, so it could be determined that it definitely did not happen. Someone also asked if such an incident occurred in the future and was reported to the Japanese side, would the Japanese military authorities investigate it. The spokesperson replied that such an incident was unimaginable, so they did not intend to investigate it. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Recaptures Yuanma</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to military news here today, the Japanese troops occupying Yuanma have retreated to the north since the Chinese army attacked under the personal command of a senior officer. At the same time, the Japanese transportation line northwest of Yuanqu has also been cut off by the Chinese guerrillas. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The hope that the Japanese troops who have invaded the Zhongtiao Mountains seven times will inevitably be annihilated has been confirmed by the good news from the front line on the 26th. Yuanqu has been recaptured by the Chinese army. A senior officer personally inspected the troops at the front line. The morale was high, and everyone had the spirit of fighting against a hundred Japanese. After Yuanqu was recaptured, the Chinese army's pursuing troops have advanced to the southwest of Gaoluo, and the recapture of Gaoluo is imminent. In this battle, there was a bloody battle with the Japanese army for six days. According to statistics, the Japanese army suffered about 5,000 casualties. (Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty and Sino-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, the Chinese and Soviet authorities simultaneously announced that the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty was signed in Moscow on June 16. The full text has not been published, and we have no way of knowing the full picture. According to foreign电报 yesterday: In addition to the commercial clauses, there are also provisions on general mutual assistance, which needs to be verified. But this decision is entirely based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. At least with regard to commerce and navigation between China and the Soviet Union, a common standard has been established. There is no doubt about this. From now on, exchanges between the two countries will be more convenient and close, and the relationship between the two countries will be more rational and stable. The future development has also gained a solid and powerful starting point. Originally, eight or nine out of ten relationships between countries are in commerce, and the treaties between countries are also based on commerce as the most common and ordinary. In other words, the commercial treaty is the most normal and important treaty internationally. Because it is common and ordinary, it does not need to be overblown. Because it is normal and important, it is not despised as routine writing. Although the declaration of the establishment of this Sino-Soviet commercial treaty should be viewed with new eyes.</p>
<p>From the nature of the commercial treaty itself: although Sino-Soviet trade has continued in reality, there is no treaty as a basis. The negotiations on the conclusion of the commercial treaty have been going on for a long time and have consumed countless words. Only because the two sides have different opinions and there are various factual and technical difficulties, it has been impossible to reach an agreement repeatedly. Now it is declared to be formally signed. We at least feel that this commercial treaty is a gratifying and comforting outcome of years of difficult birth. What's more, China is in the midst of a war of resistance, and the seaports have almost all fallen, relying on land transportation for foreign trade. And the long continental boundary line of China accounts for more than three-fifths of the total boundary line between China and the Soviet Union. This is enough to illustrate the importance of concluding a treaty for commerce. Moreover, not only that, the substantive assistance that the Soviet Union has provided to China in the war of resistance is such that we cannot describe the magnitude of its quantity and nature in numbers. However, its magnitude is the consistent assessment of the world today. This has its supreme value in material terms, which goes without saying, and the spiritual value indirectly expressed is subtle and magnificent. As between July 7th and August 13th, a non-aggression pact was signed, and it was publicly announced a week after August 13th. This can be said to be spiritual assistance, the embodiment of spiritual value! Therefore, the aggressor China at that time was greatly shocked. The public opinions of the various friendly nations all congratulated China, and French newspapers once compared it to a rocket on the neck of a wild bull. Two years later, China shows the repeated efforts of the war of resistance, and at a time when Japan wants to stop but cannot, and is at a loss, there is another commercial treaty between China and the Soviet Union. Regardless of whether the content of the commercial treaty contains the provisions of general mutual assistance as reported by foreign telegrams, the significance and spiritual significance of this matter at this time far exceed the normal and ordinary international commercial treaties! Therefore, we should judge this treaty as an expression of extreme friendship from the Soviet Union to China, and as a diplomatic success of great value for China!</p>
<p>For two years in China's war of resistance, it has won the deep sympathy of righteous people all over the world, and the warm assistance of peace-loving nations and countries all over the world. In terms of nature, of course, the amount of assistance does not distinguish the depth of sympathy, and its value is equally precious. However, in this immeasurable number of sympathy and assistance, the most important is undoubtedly the increasing friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The increasing closeness of Sino-Soviet relations is not only determined by historical and geographical factors, but mainly because the Soviet Union has a fundamental policy of "helping oppressed nations to fight for liberation" on the one hand, and also because the Soviet Union can focus on the big picture and take a long-term view, and is willing to sacrifice for the sake of common interests. This is different from the capitalist calculations of immediate gains. Originally, China and the Soviet Union had a solid foundation of friendship, and they also had a common goal. Their interests are consistent, and they stand on the common front against fascist aggression. For two years, the assistance given by the Soviet Union to China has indeed been the greatest, whether in the arena of international diplomacy or in material assistance. Although some people regret that the Soviet Union did not send troops, and it is natural for Chinese to hope that the Soviet Union would send troops, considering the overall international situation, one cannot but forgive the Soviet Union for not sending troops, and one cannot assert that the continuous supply of material assistance is more beneficial than the Soviet Union sending troops. From the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact to the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty, it shows a trend of closer Sino-Soviet relations. May the Soviet Union provide more assistance to China after the establishment of the commercial treaty, so that China can complete the great task of resistance and victory as soon as possible!</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Land and Air Conflicts Occur on the "Manchurian" Border with Mongolia, Confirmed by Soviet Communiqué, Claiming 59 Japanese Planes Shot Down, Soviet-Mongolian Forces Secure Border Strongholds</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A recently released Soviet communiqué details the events of the land and air warfare that took place along the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border during the past month. According to the communiqué, between May 28th and June 24th, a total of 59 Japanese aircraft were shot down, while the Soviets and Outer Mongolians lost a combined 23 aircraft. The communiqué also states that Soviet and Mongolian forces now occupy all strongholds in the area east of the Khalkhyn Gol River on the "Manchurian" side of the border. The communiqué begins by recounting the cause of the conflict and the attack by Japanese-Manchurian forces on May 11th on Outer Mongolian border outposts in the southeastern region of Lake Buir Nur, stating that hardly a day passed without conflict in the following days, resulting in casualties on both sides. Towards the end of May, after the Japanese-Manchurian forces received reinforcements from Hailar, three major battles occurred, resulting in 400 Japanese deaths and many injuries. The defending forces also suffered 40 deaths and 70 injuries. The defending forces obtained a document signed by the commander of the 23rd Division of the Japanese Army in Hailar, urging his troops to jointly eliminate the Outer Mongolian forces in the Khalkhyn Gol area. The communiqué mentions air combat, stating that on May 28th, Japanese aircraft attacked two airfield battlefields. Soviet-Mongolian fighters took off after a slight delay to engage them. Although they lost nine aircraft, they shot down three Japanese aircraft. On June 22nd, 120 Japanese aircraft attacked again. The defending forces responded with 95 aircraft, resulting in 31 enemy aircraft being shot down and 12 of their own being lost. On June 24th, both sides engaged in fierce aerial combat with 60 aircraft each, with the Japanese losing 25 aircraft and the Soviet-Mongolian side losing only two. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Large-scale land and air conflicts that occurred over the past month in the area bordering Outer Mongolia and "Manchuria" have been confirmed by a communiqué released by official sources. It states that between the 22nd and 24th of this month, a total of 56 Japanese-"Manchurian" aircraft were shot down, while the Soviet and Outer Mongolian side lost only 14. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>TASS Reports on Conflict Incident Occurring in the Lake Buir Area, Mongolian Border Station Defense Troops Attacked by Japanese-Manchurian Forces, Two Invasions into Mongolian Territory Repelled, Allied Forces Never Crossed Border During Conflict, Only Forced to Fly Over "Manchurian" Airspace During Air Combat</h3>
<p>(Moscow) TASS recently released a communiqué stating, "Since May 15th of this year, several foreign newspapers, based on announcements from the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army, have continuously published news of conflicts between the army of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Japanese-'Manchurian' army. According to Japanese newspapers, this conflict was initiated by Mongolian troops crossing into "Manchurian" territory. At the same time, Japanese newspapers have exaggeratedly publicized how the Mongolian army and air force suffered "significant" losses.</p>
<p>"TASS, based on information obtained from the headquarters of the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces within the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic, is authorized to provide the following accurate report regarding the events on the Mongolian-'Manchurian' border.</p>
<p>"This incident occurred in the Lake Buir area on the border of "Manchukuo" and unfolded as follows: On May 11th of this year, Mongolian border station defense troops in the Nomonhan and Bair Dobo areas, 16 to 20 kilometers southeast of Lake Buir and the Khalkhyn Gol River (i.e., the river referred to as the Halha River by the Japanese - translator's note), were suddenly attacked by Japanese-'Manchurian' forces. They were forced to withdraw westward from the border to the banks of the Khalkhyn Gol River. Subsequently, conflicts occurred in this area almost daily for the next ten days, starting from the 12th, with casualties on both sides.</p>
<p>"On May 22nd, after receiving reinforcements, the Japanese-'Manchurian' forces attempted to attack the Mongolian army and penetrate deeper into Mongolian territory, but as a result, suffered considerable losses and were forced to retreat from the border.</p>
<p>"On May 28th and 29th, the Japanese-'Manchurian' forces again received a large number of fresh troops from Hailar, including tanks, armored vehicles, artillery vehicles, artillery units, and a large air force. They once again invaded Mongolian territory but were immediately defeated by the local Mongolian forces, and completely retreated back into "Manchurian" territory, abandoning a large number of dead, wounded, and military supplies on the battlefield. In this battle, more than 400 Japanese-'Manchurian' soldiers were killed, while the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army suffered only 40 deaths and 70 injuries. The Mongolian army also destroyed three Japanese military command posts, one of which was the command post of Lieutenant Colonel Higashi (Hachizo), the unit commander. Among the documents seized in the command posts was an original order issued on May 21st from Hailar by the commander of the 23rd Division of the Japanese Army. In this order, the division commander, among other things, ordered his subordinate units, 'The Foreign Mongol army along the Khalkhyn Gol must be annihilated by the sole power of this division.'</p>
<p>"During this incident, in addition to land conflicts, there were also air engagements. On May 28th, a squadron of enemy fighters and bombers crossed into Mongolian territory and launched a surprise attack on two Mongolian military airfields. The Mongolian-Soviet air force, due to being caught off guard, took off somewhat late, allowing the enemy forces to gain a slight advantage. As a result of the engagement, the Mongolian-Soviet air force lost nine aircraft, while the Japanese side lost three. However, in the end, the Japanese aircraft were driven back in disarray to their base.</p>
<p>"On June 22nd, the Japanese-'Manchurian' air force launched a large-scale attack with 120 aircraft. The Mongolian-Soviet air force responded with 95 aircraft. As a result, the Japanese-'Manchurian' side had 31 aircraft shot down, while the Mongolian-Soviet side lost 12 aircraft. On June 24th, the Japanese-'Manchurian' air force launched a third attack with 60 aircraft. The Mongolian-Soviet side also responded with 60 aircraft, resulting in 25 of the enemy's aircraft being shot down, while only two of our own were lost.</p>
<p>"The border between the two sides has been peaceful and uneventful since June 25th. As of now, the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces firmly occupy all strongholds on the "Manchurian" side of the Khalkhyn Gol River. Throughout the entire conflict, the Mongolian-Soviet Allied Forces have never crossed the original border, except when the air force was forced to fly over "Manchurian" airspace while driving away the Japanese-'Manchurian' air force." (TASS, 25th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Decides to Defend Outer Mongolian Territory</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government, having just signed a commercial agreement with China on the 16th of this month, has now issued an official communiqué today confirming that a dispute did indeed occur on the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border. The close proximity of these two events has attracted widespread attention. The Japanese side suspects that the agreement between China and the Soviet Union contains mutual assistance clauses. However, regardless, it can be confidently asserted that the Soviet Union's supply of military equipment to China will definitely increase significantly in the future. In addition, Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech to the Supreme Soviet at the end of last month, strongly stating that the Soviet Union is determined to defend Outer Mongolian territory as if it were defending its own territory. The significance of this is naturally very important. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japan Claims 133 Soviet Planes Lost</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers claim that since June 20th, a total of 133 Soviet aircraft have been shot down in the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border war. On Saturday and Sunday, Japanese reconnaissance planes challenged 14 Soviet aircraft and shot down three of them in the vicinity of Lake Buir Nur, which is where the major battle between the two sides took place on June 22nd. In that battle, the Japanese shot down 49 Soviet aircraft, while also losing five Japanese aircraft. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from the Kwantung Army headquarters in Changchun, a total of 131 Soviet Russian aircraft have been shot down on the "Manchukuo" border since May 20th. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Political Figures Issue Statement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo political figures issued a statement last night, strongly asserting that Japan views the border conflicts in western "Manchukuo" not as isolated incidents, but as an organized action by Moscow, with the aim of restraining the Japanese-"Manchurian" forces, preventing them from being transferred elsewhere for combat, and secretly helping General Chiang Kai-shek. Regarding this matter, local newspapers are cautioning Soviet Russia not to underestimate Japan's strength and are simultaneously requesting that the Japanese government lodge the sharpest protest with Moscow.

<h3>Soviet Views on Negotiations, British and French Governments Discussing, British Foreign Office to Issue New Instructions</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax hoped to issue further instructions to Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador to Moscow, within days. The British government is currently consulting with the French government regarding the Soviet government's criticisms of the recent Anglo-French proposals. He believed that sending a cabinet member to Moscow, as suggested in the question by Labour MP Dalton, would not be helpful. According to Dalton, the various difficulties that have arisen in the current negotiations have greatly pleased Berlin, which could accelerate German aggression and lead to a European war. The Prime Minister replied that this may be the case and he hoped that the Soviet government felt the same way. In response to a Member's request that the Prime Minister disclose the state of consultations with the French government, the Prime Minister replied that he was not prepared to disclose any details. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain recently declared in the House of Commons that the government will send new instructions to Ambassador Seeds regarding the ongoing Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, has submitted a detailed report to London regarding the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France and the Soviet Union. These negotiations are due to continue within days. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Mr Strang, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, has come here to assist British Ambassador Sir Seeds in negotiations with the Soviet authorities regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France and the Soviet Union. It has been twelve days since that assistance began, during which negotiations have never ceased. Representatives from Britain and France have presented two different proposals to Foreign Minister Molotov, both of which the Soviet government deemed unsatisfactory. According to well-informed sources, the British and French ambassadors will soon receive new instructions, directing them to present a third solution to the Soviet government. As for Mr Strang personally, he has accumulated experience in conducting negotiations with the Soviet authorities and does not express anxiety about the stagnation of the three-party negotiations. After each conversation with the Soviet authorities, he often appears before reporters with a smile and a calm demeanor. He repeatedly refuses to answer questions from reporters, citing that the time is not right. Therefore, no one knows the outline of the suggestions he has put forward to the British government. However, local British sources generally believe that Mr. Strang has conducted a thorough study of the intentions of the Soviet government and is reportedly advocating for accepting the Soviet side's claims. Even if Britain refuses to provide guarantees to the Baltic states, Britain, France and the Soviet Union may form an agreement with themselves as the scope of the three signatory countries. However, this may not contribute to the formation of a peace group to resist aggression throughout Europe. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources here, British representatives do not intend to continue negotiations with the Soviet government in Moscow in the coming days. The British Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee will discuss the progress of the Moscow negotiations tonight, but it is feared that tonight's discussion will not yield a concrete decision, as Mr. Strang's report is very detailed and cannot be thoroughly understood without sufficient time for discussion and research. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Three-Party Agreement: Relations with Japan</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the ongoing negotiations for the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, German newspapers continue to claim that the Soviet Union is eager to extend this agreement to the Far East. However, the Soviet side denies this, stating that, given the current situation in China, the democratic countries are likely more eager than the Soviet Union to expand the three-party agreement to the Far East. As for relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, although they are not friendly, they have not reached a dangerous stage. Diplomatic circles here believe that the German side intends to provoke unease in Japan, so that it continues to cooperate with the Axis powers. Although responsible officials in Britain and France have clearly denied the reports in German newspapers, the Japanese side is indeed deeply concerned and closely monitoring the progress of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. There is a consensus that even if the Far East is not included in the three-party mutual assistance agreement after it is signed, it will inevitably be detrimental to Japan, as the Soviet Union will be able to rest easy on its western border and shift its attention to dealing with the Far East. Furthermore, once the interconnected relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is established in Europe, it will inevitably expand to the Far East sooner or later. For this reason, Chinese individuals here are eagerly hoping that the three-party negotiations will be completed as soon as possible, so that Europe can avoid war. Once war breaks out in Europe, Western countries will be unable to take care of themselves and will not be able to continue supplying military goods, which would be detrimental to China. In addition, recently the Soviet Union and Japan have frequently had conflicts on the "Manchukuo" border. Foreign observers here do not attach great importance to these, generally saying that such disputes are mostly unknown to the Soviet people and that the authorities on both the Soviet and Japanese sides are generally concealing them. This is worth noting. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>French Newspapers Discuss Chamberlain's Speech</p>
<p>(Paris) Local newspapers have criticized Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on Saturday. L'Ordre published an article by Bertina, stating that the Prime Minister would do well to postpone his attempts at reconciliation and appeasement until after the agreement with the Soviet Union is completed. Madame Tabouis also declared in L'Oeuvre that, judging from Germany's attitude towards this speech, it further proves that Berlin will not change the decisions it has already taken. La République states that the German reaction is caused by the aim of separating Britain and France. The German intention is to make the French believe that the meaning of Anglo-French cooperation is tantamount to France being reduced to a British appendage, but if France must be reduced to an appendage, it is willing to belong to Britain rather than Germany. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Formidable, Churchill Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>(London) Mr. Churchill, leader of the far right wing of the Conservative Party, gave a speech today in Woodford, Essex, in which he explained the strength of the British Air Force and air defense forces. He said that the effectiveness of the British Air Force and air defense organization has been greatly improved, and any enemy air raids will be subject to significant losses and extreme danger. While this does not mean that foreign aircraft will not attack, if enemy aircraft attack during the day, at least one out of every five will be shot down, which will naturally deter the enemy. As for night raids, the outcome is still uncertain. What can be said is that our Air Force, with the help of various scientific equipment, will not suffer significant losses, and even if enemy aircraft want to attack important locations at night, it will be difficult to achieve accuracy. In short, within our country, 99 out of every 100 square miles can be free from air raids. Finally, he said that the crisis that submarines can pose is now not as severe as it was in 1917-18.

<h3>Hitler Praises Joint German-Italian Front, Speech to Italian Volunteer Soldiers</h3>
<p>Munich: Five hundred Italian volunteer soldiers who fought in the Spanish Civil War, led by Mr. Terzacqua, President of the Italian War Veterans Association, arrived here and met with Führer Hitler today. The Führer immediately delivered a speech to them, stating in brief, "After the signing of the Alliance Treaty between Germany and Italy, a common front has been established to resist common enemies. It is a pleasure to have you here at this time. The plutocracy of democracy and capitalism seeks to dominate our destiny. Now, the nations of Germany and Italy will cooperate to resist them, and they will inevitably fail. In the course of the struggle, only those nations that are determined to sacrifice their lives for their survival and future when necessary can exist in the world. We are deeply convinced that if necessary, we will make this sacrifice for Germany and Italy, and no matter how the other world attacks, it will fail because our two nations have indestructible unity. The future world will belong to Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germany Arranges Everything in Danzig, Intends to Preemptively Strike, Secretly Supplies Stormtroopers with Weapons, Builds Pontoon Bridge on Vistula River</h3>
<p>Warsaw: According to reliable sources, Germany is making preparations in the city of Danzig, intending to put pressure on the Polish government, forcing it to deal with it in haste, and using this as a pretext for intervention. It is reported that thousands of young people in East Prussia are currently undergoing military training and will soon be sent to the Free City of Danzig disguised as tourists. Members of the German Nazi Stormtroopers who are already in the city have also secretly received large quantities of guns and ammunition. Even the German police in Danzig, numbering 3,000, have been equipped with multiple anti-aircraft guns and field guns. The Danzig city authorities have also begun building a pontoon bridge on the Vistula River east of the city to facilitate transportation between East Prussia and Danzig. Once completed, Germany will be able to secretly import weapons into Danzig. (Note: Currently, there is only one bridge near Danzig that crosses the Vistula River, but before entering the city, it is necessary to pass through Polish territory.) In addition, a large number of cars and trucks drove from East Prussia during a recent sports event in Danzig and are now being kept in the city under the pretext of repairs. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Danzig: The "Danziger Post" published a detailed map of German defense lines yesterday on the first page. The map showed that the entire East Prussia up to the Memel area has a solid defense chain, and there is a second similar chain in central East Prussia. Below the map, the newspaper published a lengthy essay, mentioning that the military correspondent of the French "Le Temps" recently published an article, emphasizing that if military action is taken against Germany, the Polish Air Force will occupy an important position. The "Danziger Post" claimed that the author of the article clearly underestimated German power, and it must be known that the German army in the Baltic Sea is stronger than any enemy, and the German air force and anti-aircraft guns are the best in the world. German defenses against Poland have natural barriers and impregnable fortifications. If Poland attempts to invade, then "every German bullet will shoot directly into the heart of Warsaw."

<h3>Expo Model Gifted to British Princesses</h3>
<p>(New York) Mrs. Whalen, the wife of New York World's Fair President Whalen, recently commissioned craftsmen to make twelve models of the main buildings and entertainment venues in the fair, which were shipped to London and presented to British Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose. Queen Elizabeth, while visiting the New York Fair recently, expressed regret that the princesses were unable to come. Mrs. Whalen, therefore, presented the models to her. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Warsaw Evening Post recently reported that Nazi party members in the Free City of Danzig are currently organizing a volunteer corps with a quota of 10,000 people. The volunteers are all between the ages of 21 and 35.

<h3>Spain Brewing Restoration, Third Anniversary of Civil War, Political System May Change</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of the restoration of the monarchy in Spain, a guest from Spain replied to reporters' inquiries, saying that after the withdrawal of German and Italian volunteers from Spain, the possibility of restoration has greatly increased. General Franco, commander-in-chief of the National Army, has said to people from time to time that his belief in the monarchical system has not been extinguished, and that he believes that Spain can only achieve unity among all parties and maintain independence in diplomacy by implementing restoration. Judging from this, there may be major changes in the Spanish political system on July 18, the third anniversary of the Spanish Civil War. After the restoration of the monarchy in Spain, Prince Don Juan, son of the deposed King Alfonso (who abdicated on April 15, 1931), is most likely to ascend the throne. However, there is also talk of Alfonso himself returning to the throne. In addition, the majority of Spaniards are opposed to forming a military alliance with Germany and Italy, saying that Spain's military strength is incomparable to that of the Axis powers, and if they conclude an alliance with those countries, they will inevitably be completely controlled by them.

<h3>Slovakian Soldiers and Civilians Clash with German Garrison, Several German Soldiers Disarmed</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The semi-official PATE news agency recently received a report from the capital of Slovakia, stating that the Slovakian army recently had a serious clash with German soldiers stationed in the city of Žilina. The "Morning Express" newspaper also reported that as a result of the clash, a total of ten people were killed and several others were injured. Many residents of the Slovakian community in the city also automatically assisted the army in disarming several German soldiers. At the same time, a similar incident occurred in the town of Lúčatín (the hometown of Father Hlinka, leader of the Slovak People's Party), where residents marched in the streets and shouted "Long live Slovakian freedom! Drive the Germans out of the country!" (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Singapore: Anglo-French Conference Concludes; Details Not Announced in Official Communiqué; Australian Naval Minister Passes Through Singapore</h3>
<p>(Singapore) The Anglo-French defense conference concluded today. Government circles have released the first official communiqué, stating that all external reports regarding the matters discussed and decisions made are purely speculative. Observers believe that Anglo-French unity will be strengthened as a result, and the discussions will have a positive impact on the situation in the Far East. It is reported that Vice Admiral Taikō, Commander-in-Chief of the French Far East Fleet, will depart on Thursday, while Admiral Nobel, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet, is scheduled to leave today. It is also reported that one of the resolutions passed at the conference stipulates that in the event of war in the Far East, the overall command of the Anglo-French fleets will be assumed by the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet, and Singapore will serve as the base of operations. All war materials of both countries will be pooled and used jointly. The conference also conducted a detailed and thorough survey of the manpower and resources of the Anglo-French forces. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>(Singapore) Reuters has learned that HMS Kent, the flagship of the British China Fleet, a 10,000-ton cruiser, is scheduled to sail to North China tonight.

It is reported that the ship is equipped with eight 8-inch guns. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>(Singapore) Admiral Nobel, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, who was originally scheduled to return to North China today aboard HMS Kent, has postponed his departure to meet with Australian Naval Minister Gullett. It is reported that the Australian Naval Minister will arrive here tomorrow, en route back to England to report on defense matters in the Pacific. Therefore, the meeting with Nobel is of great importance. It is also reported that Admiral Degoût, Commander-in-Chief of the French Far East Fleet, will return to Annam aboard the French flagship Pigot within the next day or two.

<p>(London) Mr. Lewin, a senior official of the Admiralty, replied in the House of Commons today to a question regarding the strength of the British Navy in the Far East, stating that the strength of the British Navy worldwide is constantly monitored, but it is not appropriate to release the future deployments of the fleet in the public interest.

<p>(Singapore) Vice Admiral Colvin, Chairman of the Australian Naval Board, is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow. Therefore, Admiral Nobel, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, has postponed his departure to meet with Colvin and discuss matters.

Vice Admiral Colvin is scheduled to depart for England on Friday to report to the British Admiralty on Pacific naval defense matters. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Declaration of War Issue and Sino-American Legislation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the request by four prominent Japanese politicians for a declaration of war against China, the Washington Star newspaper here published an editorial, stating that the existence of the US Neutrality Act often leads Japan and other countries to hope that the act will be implemented. Of course, if Japan declares war on China, the act may be implemented. At that point, the supply of US arms and other materials will be cut off not only to China, but also to Japan. Furthermore, while Japan would gain the rights of a belligerent country by declaring war on China, it would also have to bear the various obligations of a belligerent country. Therefore, although reports of Japan's movement towards declaring war on China are common, it is doubtful whether Tokyo can truly declare war on China. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Discusses American Silver Policy; Cessation of Silver Purchases is Unfavorable to Roosevelt</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian today published an article commenting on American silver policy, stating that American silver policy no longer has a logically defensible basis. For various reasons, American silver policy will undergo a revolutionary change on June 30. However, the cessation of silver purchases or a significant reduction in the American purchase price of silver will become a plank in the platform that is unfavorable to President Roosevelt's next election campaign. The value of silver in the national treasury will at least greatly decrease, which will be seen as President Roosevelt admitting that he has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the past five years on a purpose that is now no longer considered to have any value. Strategically, President Roosevelt may maintain his unwanted policy, which he has been implementing for five years, for another year. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>United States Must Protect Interests in China; Senator King's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator King, on the eve of the debate on the Neutrality Act yesterday, made remarks to an Associated Press reporter, stating that the US government must protect its interests in China. He highly praised the US government's handling of the Tianjin, Gulangyu, and Shantou cases, and expressed his approval of the actions of Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the Asiatic Fleet. Yarnell had rejected Japanese demands, stating that the safety of American citizens in Shantou was the responsibility of the Japanese side, and that the US fleet in China had the right to act as it pleased. King highly praised this point, and finally stated, "China and other parts of the Far East have treaty obligations to our country. We must not only protect our due rights, but also fulfill our due obligations. Therefore, we must not cease our commercial and cultural relations with the Far East, nor can we fail to protect the obligations of the peoples of China and the United States."

<h3>Philippines Should Seek Self-Defense</h3>
<p>Collective Security Congress Warns People of the Philippine Islands</p>
<p>(Manila) The Democratic Politics and Collective Security Congress, which is preparing to hold its annual meeting here on July 4, today issued a warning to the people of the Philippines, urging them to recognize Japan's aggression and prepare to defend the freedom of the Philippines. The full text advocates that the people of the Philippines should fight for democracy and resist the fascist dictatorship of Japan, Italy, and Germany. The text states, "In the current international situation, there is a conspiracy to undermine democratic politics. Fascist propaganda is constantly trying to overthrow the principles of democracy and freedom, and replace them with blind obedience and a life of slavery. This propaganda is now active in every part of the world. The fascists of Japan are now trying to subjugate a great nation and turn it into a slave of Japan, and sooner or later they will extend their evil claws to this beautiful archipelago. Therefore, for our own sake, we must not only strengthen our self-defense forces materially, but also strengthen our self-defense will spiritually." (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since McNutt, the US High Commissioner to the Philippines, advocated that the United States retain the Philippines, many people here believe that Congress will have to reconsider the Philippines independence plan. At the same time, the US government's firm stance on the situation in the Far East also indicates that this case needs to be re-discussed. Philippine Vice President Osmeña, who is here, cannot openly agree with McNutt's views, but in private conversations, he highly praised McNutt's courage. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<h3>Success of Soviet Pavilion at New York World's Fair</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda recently published an article in which Soviet Pavilion Committee member Vyacheslav Molotov made remarks to reporters, stating that "Visitors to the World's Fair are mostly focused on the Soviet Pavilion. Evidence of this fact is the increase in the number of visitors, the large number of newspaper reviews, and the enthusiastic welcome of visitors to concerts and film screenings in the pavilion. All of this proves that the Soviet Pavilion is the best of all the foreign pavilions. All visitors unanimously stated that the Soviet Pavilion best realizes the overall theme of the fair, namely, to express 'The World of Tomorrow' and 'That Man is the Most Precious Thing in the World.'" Molotov concluded, "The broad masses of the American people warmly welcome the Soviet Pavilion because it allows them to see firsthand the great success of victorious socialism. The Soviet Union's decision to participate in the New York World's Fair will help to further strengthen economic and cultural ties between the Soviet Union and the United States." (TASS, 25th)</p>
<h3>Irish Stage Demonstrations, Demanding Freedom for Ireland, Opposing Conscription</h3>
<p>(London) Today, approximately 200 people from the Irish Free State marched in procession along the streets where bomb attacks had occurred on the previous two days. They wore armbands in the colors of yellow, green, and white, and carried various flags with inscriptions such as "No Peace Until Ireland is Free," "Death Rather Than Conscription," and "Down with Craigavon (Prime Minister of Northern Ireland), de Valera (President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State), Chamberlain, and Franco." After the march, several people stood on soapboxes and delivered speeches, denouncing British imperialism. More than 2,000 people gathered to listen. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The continuing violence by members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) is causing increasing concern in both England and Ireland. London police are extremely busy due to the series of bomb attacks over the weekend, which injured a total of 19 people. Military police throughout Ireland are also highly active. On Sunday, the entire city of Dublin was in turmoil. Crowds gathered in various streets, anticipating demonstrations against the recent legislation aimed at dealing with the IRA. This legislation includes banning the IRA and prohibiting them from traveling to the pilgrimage site of Bodenstown. When a group of IRA members, numbering about 100, marched into Dublin carrying flags, they clashed with police and were all arrested, except for the flag bearer, who escaped. Several young people also paraded through the streets of Dublin. Afterwards, a rally was held in front of the General Post Office, without police intervention. Sympathizers of the IRA brandished a British flag, with some advocating that it be burned, while others wanted to tear it up. But ultimately, it was cut into pieces with a knife. In London, the bombings damaged four banks in the West End and arson bombs tried to burn mail boxes in the Mailierbone district. The scene was particularly tense after the West End bomb exploded. Police requisitioned taxis, stood on the footboards, and directed traffic. Volunteer National Defense Forces and mounted police were also ordered to assist in handling the crowds and traffic. One person was surrounded and beaten by the crowd amidst shouts of killing, and was eventually rescued by the police. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Cardinal Hinsley, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, recently issued a declaration expressing his attitude towards the repeated terrorist actions of the IRA, threatening to excommunicate IRA members who engage in these secret activities. Cardinal Hinsley's declaration is receiving great attention, as most Irish people are devout Catholics. This declaration may be able to stop the terrorist actions of the IRA. (Haitong, 26th)</p>
<p>Dublin: Police in Cork, Ireland, clashed severely with IRA members last night. The IRA members also formed ranks and staged a demonstration. The police were unable to disperse them and relied on armored vehicles to drive them away and restore order. (Haitong, 26th)</p>
<h3>Genghis Khan's Coffin Arrives in Xi'an from Xianyang; Business Community Lines Up Outside the City to Welcome It; Chiang Ting-wen and Others Preside Over a Public Memorial Service After Its Entry into the City</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Genghis Khan's coffin was moved south. The Military Affairs Commission and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission sent special envoys Tang Bingran and Chu Mingshan to escort the coffin. It was transported from Ikin Khoroo in the Yike Zhao League on the 11th, arrived in Yulin on the 15th, and departed from Yifu on the 18th. People in the counties along the way warmly welcomed and paid tribute to it. On the 24th, it arrived in Xianyang. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life in Xi'an lined up five miles outside the city to welcome it. Governor Chiang Ting-wen, the Vice President of the Military Advisory Council, government officials, students from various schools, and people from all walks of life, numbering over 30,000, gathered. The scene was unprecedented. The coffin departed from Xianyang at 5:00 PM on the 25th and arrived in the outskirts of Xi'an at 6:00 PM. The first vehicle contained the divine spear, Surdin, and some sacrificial vessels. The divine spear was the weapon used by the Great Khan in his conquests. Today, Mongolians have a level of reverence for it that is almost equal to that of the Great Khan. There were six guards on it, two carrying spears and the other four each holding a red flag with a painted design. The second vehicle contained the coffin of the Great Khan and the coffin of his wife, both of which were silver coffins. The third and fourth vehicles contained the Darhad guard of the mausoleum and the guards sent by Prince Jinongtu, the chief priest of the mausoleum, totaling over 40 people. The vehicles were hung with the flags of the Kuomintang and red and yellow colored silks. When the vehicles stopped, various sectors held a welcoming ceremony, presided over by Governor Chiang Ting-wen. After the ceremony, the coffin set off, with the Darhad escorts riding horses ahead, followed by the full ceremonial guard and the band. Police and security personnel guarded the coffin behind the vehicles. Together with the people welcoming the coffin, the procession stretched for more than three miles. At 7:00 PM, the procession entered Anding Gate. The streets were decorated with flags and colored silks, and roadside sacrifices were set up everywhere. The sound of firecrackers resounded throughout the sky. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets, vying to catch a glimpse of the coffin. The enthusiasm of the scene was unprecedented in Xi'an. At 8:00 PM, the memorial ceremony began, with Chiang Ting-wen as the chief priest and Zhou Xinwan and over 30 others as accompanying priests. First, a public memorial service was held, and it was decided that government agencies, organizations, and schools would pay tribute separately. The ceremony was extremely solemn and lasted until after 11:00 PM. Governor Chiang specially hosted a banquet on the evening of the 25th to entertain the Mongolian banner escorts. (26th dispatch)</p>
<h3>News of Canadian Pastor's Death Confirmed</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) It was learned today that Reverend and Mrs. Caswell, Canadian missionaries in Changde, Hunan, died tragically during the Japanese air raid on Changde on June 24. A Reuters reporter recently visited the British diplomatic mission here, and officially confirmed the tragic news. It is reported that the British authorities yesterday received a telegram from the principal of the Canadian church school in Changde, reporting the death of Reverend and Mrs. Caswell. The original text of the telegram stated that on June 24, Japanese aircraft bombed Changde for more than an hour and a half, deliberately and systematically bombing the Canadian church buildings. Reverend and Mrs. Caswell were both killed. Prior to this telegram, a Chinese telegram had arrived here from Changde, stating that Japanese aircraft had fiercely bombed the city on the 24th, and the church buildings had been hit and caught fire. Reverend and Mrs. Caswell were missing, and it was believed that both had died. Reverend Caswell was the secretary of the Canadian Pentecostal Movement, which only had one mission in China, in Changde, Hunan. Reverend and Mrs. Caswell were both Canadian Christian missionaries from Ottawa. (Reuter, 26th)</p>

<p>Cologne: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, in a speech to the Nazi Party Congress yesterday, said that Britain's threats are not worth taking seriously, saying "The Japanese can strip the British naked, and the British are powerless." Goebbels' speech was in response to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Cardiff on Saturday, in which he said "Britain is determined to oppose the use of force to achieve changes that should be decided by discussion and cooperation." Goebbels replied, "We do not want empty words from London, but actual deeds. If events lead to a crisis, then we are prepared to risk following the government, because those who do not gamble can never win. We do not care if the British Prime Minister makes threatening statements, because there is no power behind his threats. The Japanese can even strip the British naked and the British are powerless. Although the German Kaiser and the German army were once completely destroyed, this will never happen again in the future." (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Labor Front leader Dr. Ley spoke to an audience of 16,000 near Berlin yesterday, referring to the humiliation that Britain is currently suffering in Tianjin, saying that wherever one looks at this world empire, one sees its failures coming one after another. If Britain had not previously rejected the German leader's repeated requests and formed a friendly and conscious alliance with Germany, it would not have suffered this humiliation. The blockade that Britain is currently suffering in Tianjin is the same blockade that Britain once imposed on Germany, but even worse. Britain must endure this humiliation, which is not a material issue under debate in the Far East, but the humiliation that Britain must endure. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>Hainan Island People Form Anti-Japanese Alliance of Villages, Japanese Army's "Using Chinese to Control Chinese" Plot Difficult to Implement, Over 400 Japanese Soldiers Killed Last Month</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Bay dispatch: The Japanese army has invaded and occupied Hainan Island for over three months. Within the occupied area, they have exhausted various methods to achieve their poisonous scheme of "using Chinese to control Chinese," but have ultimately failed to achieve their desires. Recently, over 300 puppet soldiers stationed in Luohu City, Qiongshan County, sent representatives to surrender to the Chinese guerrillas, defecting en masse. They have now been reorganized by the Chinese army and concentrated in a certain area, preparing for a counter-offensive. Furthermore, the Japanese recently constructed an airfield in Xitang Village, more than ten li from Puqian City in Wenchang County, forcibly conscripting male and female laborers. Over a hundred Japanese soldiers were dispatched daily to supervise the work. The Chinese guerrillas took the opportunity to disguise themselves as villagers and apply for work. Initially, the Japanese inspections were very strict, with all workers required to undergo body searches before being allowed to enter. However, they gradually became lax. The guerrillas then secretly brought hand grenades in by the female team members. One day at lunchtime, the female team members pretended to go to the stream next to the village to wash clothes, secretly removing the hand grenades and handing them to the male team members. At this time, the Japanese soldiers were having lunch, gathered in one place. The guerrillas then threw the grenades at them. The Japanese soldiers, unaware of where the Chinese army came from, were panicked and disorganized, many being hit and falling to the ground, while the rest scurried away. It is estimated that over sixty Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle. The guerrillas seized countless military supplies and, having achieved their objective, gathered their team members and retreated safely.</p>
<p>Military and Civilians Continuously Attack Japanese Troops at Long</p>
<p>A certain unit of the Chinese regular army recently joined forces with local militias to counter-attack Puqian City in Wenchang, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. Over twenty Japanese soldiers were killed, and many spoils of war were seized. The Japanese soldiers fled in disarray, plundering the residents' food supplies and setting fire to houses before leaving. After the Chinese army entered the city, they immediately handled the aftermath. It has been found that since the Japanese army landed on Qiong, Chinese militias have continuously launched attacks against them, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese army. In Wenchang County alone, over 400 were killed last month (May). In early this month, over two hundred Japanese soldiers suddenly surrounded Zadou City in the county, falsely claiming that guerrillas were hiding there. Without any explanation, they opened fire with machine guns, killing dozens of innocent civilians. According to those who escaped from Hainan Island, after the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island in February, due to insufficient troop strength, it was not until April that they, guided by Chinese traitors Wu, Zhou, Huo, etc., invaded and occupied Dan County in western Island, and organized a puppet maintenance association, appointing Wu, Zhou, and others as puppet chairmen. However, the local customs of the county were strong and resilient. The people, led by Liang, organized guerrillas to fight the Japanese army. In mid-May, Wu led over three hundred Japanese soldiers from the county seat to attack Dashiji in the county. Liang and others, upon hearing the news, immediately led the guerrillas to ambush them midway, destroying roads and digging traps. When the Japanese army arrived near Leqi City by car, they fell into the traps. The guerrillas then launched a fierce attack from the roadside, resulting in the deaths of over a hundred Japanese soldiers. Wu was also seriously injured. After this battle, the guerrillas' reputation greatly increased. Currently, the people of Guangcai City, Baoshe City, Leqi City, and Sili and other places in the county, in addition to raising funds and weapons to organize guerrillas to fight under the command of Liang and others, have also formed an anti-Japanese alliance of villages. All villages that have formed the alliance must thoroughly resist the Japanese army and do their best to support the guerrillas. If the Japanese army attacks one village, all other villages will rise up to fight together. Since the formation of the alliance, the people's will to resist the war has become even more firm. Many of the Northeastern puppet soldiers in the Japanese army are unwilling to fight. Recently, over ten puppet soldiers stationed in Dan County requested local people to guide them to join the guerrillas. The people initially dared not believe them. They pleaded repeatedly and offered a hundred yuan as a guide fee to show their sincerity. The people then led them to the guerrillas with their weapons. This further illustrates the low morale of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Dividing into Seven Districts, Launching a Counter-Offensive</p>
<p>At present, in order to intensify the mobilization of the people of Hainan Island to unite in resisting the war, the Chinese military and political authorities in the Southern War Zone have specially appointed Wu Daonan as the administrative supervisor of the Ninth District. Wu has crossed the ocean and safely arrived on Qiong Island, where he is consulting with Garrison Commander Wang Yi to launch a large-scale counter-offensive. Qiongya has been divided into seven districts, with one wartime supervisory director assigned to each district to intensify the advancement of wartime work. The supervisory directors for each district are as follows: Yang Yongren for the Qiong (Shan) Wen (Chang) District, Wen Huazhou for the Cheng (Mai) Ding (An) District, Long Ju for the Qiong (Dong) Le (Hui) District, Liang Fuhan for the Ling (Shui) Bao (Ting) District, Luo Lianfeng for the Ya (County) Le (Dong) District, Qian Kaixin for the Chang (Jiang) Gan (En) District, and Wang Hongrao for the Dan (County) Lin (Gao) Bai (Sha) District. County magistrates who have not handled wartime work effectively have been dismissed and reassigned. Zhan Xuexin, the county magistrate of Wenchang, has taken office. Chen Zongshun of Dan County was negligent in resisting the war when the county seat fell on April 16 and has been dismissed. His vacancy has been filled by Wang Hongrao concurrently. The headquarters of the Japanese army stationed on the island is located in the overseas Chinese hotels Qiao Shang and Qiao An on Desheng Street in Haikou.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Relieve Refugees</p>
<p>After the fall of Hainan Island, the relief department of the Qiongya Overseas Chinese Federation sent personnel from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay to set up an office in Xiying to actively carry out relief work for Qiongya refugees. The Qiongya Refugee First Educational Institute was established in the old city of Guangzhou to accommodate and educate the refugees. Recently, the overseas Chinese in Qiongya in Nanyang, seeing the Qiongya compatriots fleeing from the disaster, decided that relief work must be carried out promptly to prevent the refugees from suffering without recourse. In addition to donating funds for relief, Guo Jingcheng and Wang Moren were sent as representatives to Guangzhou to inspect the relief work for Qiongya refugees. Guo and Wang first took a ship from Singapore to Hong Kong, where they met with Wang Jianbai and others from the Qiongya Overseas Chinese Federation. Together, they took a ship from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay and went to Xiying and Taozhou to inspect. They heard that although measures have been taken to receive and relieve the refugees arriving in Guangzhou Bay, this is only a temporary solution. To seek a fundamental solution, efforts must be made to solve the problem of livelihood. Their visit to Bay is charged with the important mission of fundamentally relieving the Qiongya refugees. It has now been decided to first open a Qiongya refugee village and a refugee market in Guangzhou, and to contract wasteland from the local government for cultivation, so that the livelihood problem of the refugees can be fundamentally solved. They will then go to Dongying to inspect and find three more places to set up three more Qiongnan districts in Dongying. If there is no wasteland available for cultivation in Dongying, they will seek wasteland in the French Concession of Guangzhou Bay adjacent to Guanzhou Bay and contract it from the local Chinese government. At present, they are actively proceeding with these matters. Guo and Wang have completed their inspection of the relief work for Qiongya refugees and will return to Singapore to report to the Qiongya overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Huai'an Japanese Troops Fail in Three-Pronged Raid</h3>
<p>Dismantling Obstacles in Suburbs, Cutting Sorghum and Felling Pine Trees</p>
<p>Baoying dispatch: On the morning of the 12th, over three hundred Japanese soldiers from Huai'an, with several artillery pieces and over twenty light and heavy machine guns, launched a three-pronged attack on the Chinese side after leaving the east gate. The first route, with over a hundred soldiers, attacked the Chinese positions at Jiaqiao, but were bravely resisted by the × Company of the × Regiment of the Chinese army, who routed the Japanese army. The second route, with over a hundred soldiers, advanced towards Shitang via Huangtu Bridge and forced the people to build bridges, but were repulsed by the × Company of the Chinese army. The third route, with over a hundred soldiers, built a bridge at Didonggou, preparing to advance towards the Chinese army at Heshangzhuang, but were routed by the × Regiment of the × Route of the Chinese army. The three-pronged attack failed, and they retreated back into the city.</p>
<p>Another report: On the 14th, a guerrilla team from the Chinese side launched an attack on the south gate of Huai'an along the Grand Canal. The Japanese army was feeling overwhelmed when another unit of Japanese troops detoured from Yinxi Dou to provide reinforcements. The Chinese army, having achieved its guerrilla mission, safely returned to its original defense. The Japanese army continued to retreat into the city of Huai'an. Currently, the Japanese army in Huai'an, fearing a counter-offensive by the Chinese army, is actively dismantling obstacles in the suburbs to clear the targets. They have also cut down the sorghum and corn of farmers Wang Dianchang, Wang Dianchang, Ren Xisong, Yang Buhao, Huang Dali, Xu Xingshi, and others, totaling over fifty mu, along the highway near Dongyanguang Temple. They also sawed down over a hundred pine trees in Yuanming Temple behind Yanguang Temple, with over thirty still not cut down. Later, they went to Daguan Town and ordered the residents of the town to cut down the Xiaoxie of the city river. They returned to the city at 3:00 PM. The next day, the Japanese army sent many puppet soldiers to the area east of the city to scout the Chinese military situation and cut down over a hundred pine trees in Songlin outside the north gate. They also ordered the people in the suburbs not to plant sorghum within three li, but those who had planted it were not yet cut down. Disgustingly, the Japanese army recently dressed the clay bodhisattvas near the Zixia Palace fort in military uniforms to disguise them as sentries, and deployed sentries at Xincheng and other places in Beimenjiacheng, but the Japanese army did not dare to leave the city one step at night.</p>
<h3>Jiaozhi Town, Suzhou, Suddenly Blockaded by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Due to Active Chinese Forces</p>
<p>Suzhou dispatch: In Jiaozhi Town outside Fengmen, Suzhou, the Japanese side often sends eighty soldiers to be stationed in Baosheng Temple in the town. Recently, because the Chinese army is very active nearby, they requested reinforcements from the Guangye unit in the city earlier this month, but the Japanese army in the city is also empty, and only a small number of Japanese troops were transferred to flow to the four villages for defense. Therefore, the Japanese army in the town is extremely panicked, and suddenly blocked the town from the 20th of this month, and nailed wooden piles on the surrounding river ports to prevent the Chinese army from attacking. The main roads on land are also guarded by posts, and sandbags are piled up, as if in a state of war. The Chinese who hold passes to enter and exit are searched extremely strictly.</p>
<h3>Approaching Flood Season, Along Yangtze River, Flood is Worrying</h3>
<p>Yangtze River is not Easy to Dispersing</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: Since the Anti-Japanese War started the year before, the original water conservancy institutions in Jiangsu Province have been shut down, and the Huai River guidance project has not been completed. Even the original dikes, dams, and sluices are mostly damaged. Coupled with the Yellow River bursting in Zhongmu, the flood spread, and the fields, houses, people, and animals in the lower reaches were all swept away. This year's flood season is imminent, but the Huai, Yi, Shu, and Yun Rivers have no smooth way to drain, which can easily cause a huge disaster. The waterways in Jiangnan are flat and slow, and the sluice system is gone. The sea dikes are also severely damaged and are in a precarious situation. Once the water in western Zhejiang rises, and the rivers and lakes rise together, can we be safe? It is difficult to predict. It is now known that the dikes and banks in the counties along the Yangtze River often collapse. The worst collapse is Liuyu in Jiangdu and Nantong. The erosion of Liuyu is affected by the rising of the Jiangtan in Zhenjiang. The deep pool moves north, and the river bed is brushed deep day and night. The foundation of the bank is unstable, so it collapses. Nantong is close to the estuary, and the situation is more complicated due to the top support of the tide. The old anti-collapse project has been suspended due to military affairs. Within the scope of the provincial government's ability, the counties in northern Jiangsu have been preparing for prevention. In the occupied areas, the puppet side does not care about repairing dikes and preventing floods. In the Yangtze River, Jiangyin, Madang, Jiujiang and other places, due to the military relations of the Chinese side, water gates were set up to control them. Recently, the riverbed has gradually silted up, and the drainage is not smooth. In a blink of an eye, the flood season is approaching, and the water from the upstream will be blocked and stagnant, and cannot be smoothly discharged into the sea. The water level will increase, and it will inevitably overflow horizontally, destroying dikes and breaking banks. The future disaster is very worrying.</p>

<h3>Zhenhai Port to be Blockaded, Shanghai-Ningbo Traffic Interrupted Again, Dinghai Falls, Ningbo Heavily Guarded, De Ping Moufu Returned to Shanghai from Ningbo This Morning, Fierce Street Fighting Still Ongoing in Dinghai</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army landed in Dinghai and occupied the county seat, Ningbo has been relatively close, so the situation is quite tense. In order to strengthen defense, the Ningbo Defense Command will re-ban navigation at Zhenhai Port. The two ships De Ping and Mou Fu, which were staying in Ningbo, are scheduled to leave Ningbo for Shanghai this morning. The Shanghai-Wenzhou route is still smooth. Two Japanese warships are anchored at the Dinghai pier, and street fighting is still ongoing in the city. Chuanshan is heavily guarded. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Navigation Banned</p>
<p>The Japanese army's battles in central Hubei have reached a stalemate, with no progress. The anti-war sentiment among the people in Japan is becoming increasingly strong. In order to stimulate the morale of the people, they changed direction to attack Shantou along the coast, and invaded Dinghai on the 23rd in an attempt to recover the situation. Because Dinghai is an isolated island, it has no great significance in military terms, so the Chinese side did not station a large army. After the local self-defense regiments bravely resisted, they abandoned the county seat and retreated to the first and second defense lines in Qingling. After Dinghai fell, Ningbo became tense because it was relatively close (only thirty-five nautical miles away). According to the shipping industry's telegram received yesterday afternoon, in order to strengthen defense, the Ningbo Defense Command intends to re-ban navigation at Zhenhai Port. Its nature will be the same as the previous decision to blockade. The Lao Taiping ship, which is currently used as a navigable gap in the blockade line, will not sink.</p>
<p>Two Ships Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The De Ping ship of the Italian Merchant Sino-Italian Shipping Company and the Mou Fu ship of the German Merchant Lihe Foreign Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 24th, carrying a few passengers. They arrived in Ningbo the next day. Because the situation in eastern Zhejiang has become tense and the authorities will blockade the Yong River, the De Ping and Mou Fu ships are scheduled to leave Ningbo for Shanghai at 6:00 AM on the 27th. The En De ship of the Sino-Italian Company, which was originally scheduled to depart for Ningbo yesterday, has been temporarily suspended and changed to Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Wenzhou Smooth</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Ningbo line was announced to be re-blocked, the transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang Sea was only the Wenzhou route, which is still smooth as usual. In addition to the En De ship of the Sino-Italian Company, which sailed to Wenzhou yesterday afternoon, the Baoli of the Italian Merchant Huayi Foreign Company and the Feikang of the German Merchant Lulin Foreign Company are scheduled to sail directly to Wenzhou this morning. The Haifu of the German Merchant Lihe Foreign Company is scheduled to set sail tomorrow morning. According to shipping industry news, the situation in Wenzhou has been quite uneasy in recent days, and defense has become more consolidated. Therefore, unless there are special circumstances, the shipping on the route is expected not to be hindered.</p>
<p>Dinghai Street Fighting</p>
<p>According to a passenger who arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou on the Baoli ship yesterday morning, when the Baoli ship passed through the sea off Dinghai at 9:00 AM on the 25th, it saw two Japanese warships anchored at the Dinghai pier at the foot of Dongyue Temple Mountain (the pier). There was also a Japanese warship fearing on the sea off Aoshan, and heard the sound of cannons and machine guns coming from Dinghai, which proves that there is still fierce street fighting in the area. The fire in the Dongyue Temple area has been extinguished. According to another message, three people of residents in Dinghai had already evacuated before Japanese army has landed and moved into the mountain area, the government agencies have also been safely evacuated, and it has now become a dead city. The Japanese army has gained nothing after occupying it. According to another report, the current battle is unfolding in Qingling outside the north gate and Baihu Mountain outside the west gate. Although there are no regular troops stationed in Dinghai, there are many self-defense teams, and there are also guerrillas from Shanghai, Chuansha, and Nanhui, who have been reorganized by the county government. Therefore, the strength of Dinghai's guerrilla warfare is very strong. After the Japanese army landed in Ding, the pain in the future will be great.</p>
<p>Chuanshan on Alert</p>
<p>According to shipping industry news, at 9:00 AM on the 25th, ten Japanese aircraft invaded and ravaged Zhenhai, dropping more than sixty bombs, but most of them fell in the wilderness, so the Chinese side did not suffer any losses. As for Chuanshan, because it is only separated from Dinghai by a port, the Chinese military authorities have stepped up alerts in the area since the fall of Dinghai.</p>
<h3>Three Mail Ships Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Italian Ship Carrying 900 Jews</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Four Banks to Supply Legal Tender as Much as Possible, Increase in Chippage is Expected to Eliminate Surtax, Bill Exchange to be Concentrated and Handled Regularly</h3>
<p>Since the Silver and Money Industry Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to supply the industry with legal tender as much as possible, the ministry has approved and ordered the four banks to comply. The increase in chippage in the market is expected to eliminate the surtax. The bill exchange of the silver and money industry will be concentrated and handled. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Bill Exchange to be Concentrated and Handled</p>
<p>In addition to handling the bill exchange of member banks, the Bank Bill Exchange also collects bills from other financial institutions and money industry. The money industry bill exchange specializes in handling the bill exchange of member money houses. Since the establishment of the two exchanges, they have been quite effective. Yesterday, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the silver and money industries that it has been decided through consultation between the two industries that the bill exchange of the silver and money industries will be concentrated and handled starting from July 4, 1939.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approves Supply of Legal Tender to the Industry</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has approved the request of the Silver and Money Industry Association to supply the industry with legal tender as much as possible and has ordered the China, Central, Communications, and Agricultural Banks to comply. The issuance of wages to various industries will not be restricted by the Ma Telegraph. However, an application form must be filled out and approved by the joint office of the China, Central, Communications, and Agricultural Banks. Furthermore, there will be no restrictions on moving deposits to the mainland, transferring them to mainland banks, or using them for the development of real industries. This is to encourage the transfer of funds to the mainland and the development of agriculture, industry, and mining in the mainland, and to avoid the excessive funds in Shanghai from being used for improper speculative trading.</p>
<p>Surtax on Drawing is Expected to be Eliminated</p>
<p>After the implementation of the draft system, an improper surtax on drawing was created. Although the Ministry of Finance ordered it to be abolished, the money exchange houses defied the ministry's order and charged the surtax without authorization. Fortunately, the Bank Joint Reserve Commission, entrusted by the China, Central, and Communications Banks to maintain it, initially stood at about 50 yuan per thousand yuan. Now that the four measures to stabilize the market have been implemented and the chippage of legal tender has increased, the Bank Reserve Commission has stopped maintaining the surtax on drawing. It is expected that the surtax on drawing will be eliminated by itself. At the same time, it is hoped that the Money Exchange Industry Association will advise member money houses not to engage in improper surtax on term drawing business.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks are Not Bound</p>
<p>Foreign banks are not bound by the Ministry of Finance's Ma Telegram restrictions on withdrawals. Therefore, some people are deeply concerned that funds will flow into foreign banks. However, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the silver and money industry yesterday that foreign banks have never had current account holders for drawing. All are cash. However, the interest rate is lower than that of Chinese banks and money houses. All deposits are from foreigners living in Shanghai and foreigners.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Banking and Finance Industries Handle Interbank Fund Transfers; Applications Require Collateral; "Interbank Fund Transfer Certificates" To Be Issued</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance imposed restrictions on withdrawals, the banking and finance industries association, aiming to regulate funds among members and assist industry and commerce, held several days of subcommittee meetings to study methods for stabilizing the market. A joint meeting was held yesterday at 4 PM, attended by Wu Yunzhai, Qin Runqing, Ye Fuxiao, Lin Kanghou, and others. It was decided to concentrate the original deposit reserves of the banking and finance industries held in bank reserve funds and finance industry reserve treasuries, totaling 22 million yuan. The bank reserve fund will convert 95% of this amount into legal tender over twelve weeks, starting July 4th, for circulation. The bank reserve fund will also handle interbank fund transfer applications, aiming to centralize reserves and facilitate circulation. The association will also organize a fund transfer reserve inspection committee to inspect the assets used as collateral for interbank fund transfers. Representatives from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Banks Association, and the banking and finance industries association will each send one representative, and the four banks (Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Bank) will jointly send one representative as a committee member. Inspections will be held at least once a month, and the types and amounts of reserves will be publicly announced.

<h3>Bank of China and Bank of Communications Advance Dividends to Commercial Shareholders; Advance of Half the Dividend Approved by Ministry of Finance; Subject to Ratification by Shareholders' Meeting After Situation Stabilizes</h3>
<p>The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications decided at a joint executive meeting to postpone the shareholders' meeting until the situation stabilizes and to advance half of the commercial shareholders' dividends for 1938. The original dividend rate was 7%, and now 3.5% will be issued.

<h3>Japanese Warships Shell Xingang; Japanese Troops Attempt Landing Unsuccessfully; Repelled by Strong Chinese Resistance; Japanese Warships Harass Lingdian Port Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese troops attempted to land at Xingang and other places in Haimen County, downstream of the Yangtze River. Japanese warships shelled the area, and ships sailing from Shanghai to Beisha had to temporarily turn back. However, they resumed trial voyages yesterday. The following details were obtained by a reporter from Daguan News Agency:</p>
<p>Shelling of Xingang</p>
<p>Xingang is only twenty li away from Qinglonggang, the Japanese military control zone, and ten li from the Third Factory. The Japanese military headquarters is located inside the Third Factory, surrounded by barbed wire, making it a very important military base. Therefore, the Chinese army dispatched three large guerrilla units to station near Taixing Town and Yulong Bridge, digging trenches and setting up strong fortifications. The Japanese troops stationed at the Third Factory launched several attacks, but were all repelled by the Chinese army. On the day before yesterday (the 24th), the Japanese army, in coordination with the navy, launched a combined land and sea attack. Japanese warships first shelled the area to cover Japanese troops in motorboats sailing into the port, intending to land. Shells hit civilian houses in Xingang Town, causing fires. Chinese troops hidden in the port's grass responded calmly, waiting for the Japanese motorboats to enter the firing range before opening fire with concentrated machine guns. The Japanese troops were unsuccessful and retreated quickly, returning to the warships. The warships fired indiscriminately without a specific target.</p>
<p>Ships Turn Back</p>
<p>The "Hai Yi" steamer and other ships of the German Far East Company, sailing the Beisha line, heard gunfire when they arrived at Qinglonggang on the 24th, knowing that fighting had broken out at Shanggangmen. However, they continued to advance, but to ensure the safety of passengers and cargo and avoid unexpected dangers, they turned back to Shanghai when they were four li away from Xingang Port. They arrived at the Bund wharf at about 6 PM that evening. The British Taikoo Company's "Wan Tong" steamer, protected by a British warship, sailed as usual to Lingdian Port, Sanhe Port, Dong No. 1 Port, and other ports. Passengers and cargo were discharged by rowboats. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the steamer sailed back to Shanghai with a crowded number of refugees.</p>
<p>Ships Resume Sailing</p>
<p>The Japanese troops' unsuccessful landing attempt at Xingang on the day before yesterday resulted in Japanese warships suddenly sailing to the outside of Lingdian Port yesterday (the 26th) morning and shelling the shore. Shells fell on the beach and rice paddies. The Chinese army returned fire, and fighting broke out, but the situation was not intense. Yesterday morning, the Far East Company's "Hai Xuan" steamer, the Fuhua Company's "Jiang Ding" steamer, and others sailed as usual. By evening, the company had not received any telegrams, suggesting that they had arrived safely at each port.</p>
<h3>Japanese Restrictions on British Ships Sailing to Shantou; British Consul Refuses Strongly; Japanese Allow Only One Ship Per Week; British Express No Acceptance of Any Restrictions; British Naval Authorities Order Escort by British Warships</h3>
<p>According to foreign news, on the 24th of this month, the Japanese authorities agreed that merchant ships could freely enter and exit Shantou. However, yesterday the Japanese suddenly stated that in the future, only one British ship per week would be allowed to sail into Shantou. The British naval authorities stated that the entry of British merchant ships into Shantou could not be subject to any restrictions, and that if necessary, British warships would provide escorts. Currently, British cargo warehouses in Shantou are surrounded by barbed wire by the Japanese, preventing British ships from loading and unloading cargo. According to reliable sources, the British consul in Shantou protested to the Japanese consul about the Japanese attempt to restrict British shipping in Shantou, stating that the British side could not accept the Japanese allowing only one British ship per week to sail into Shantou, and that if the Japanese were to interfere with British shipping, the British naval authorities had ordered the British warship "Shanarte" to provide escorts.</p>
<p>Taikoo and Jardine Maintain Shipping Rights</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army landed in Shantou, various foreign merchant ships sailing on the South China line have been hindered and prohibited from entering Shantou. However, the British Taikoo and Jardine companies, to maintain their shipping rights in China, decided to continue sailing as usual. The Taikoo Company's "Jinan" steamer, protected by a British destroyer, sailed into Shantou on the 23rd, but the Japanese interfered again, hindering the unloading of cargo. The British warship Captain Smith made serious representations to the Japanese side, and the ship withdrew without unloading cargo.</p>
<p>Japanese Use Pretext to Continue Blocking</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the Japanese announced again on the day before yesterday to third-country shipping companies that they would continue to block foreign ships sailing to Shantou under the pretext of preventing foreign ships from supplying the Chinese army, and stated that if third-country ships entering Shantou were transporting food and letters to third-country people in Shantou, they would be allowed to enter only after inspection. However, according to a reporter from Daguan News Agency who inquired with the shipping industry, the British Taikoo and Jardine companies will disregard the Japanese notification.</p>
<p>British Ships Continue Sailing, Upholding Original Intention</p>
<p>To effectively maintain their shipping rights, they will continue to sail as planned. The Jardine "Da Shun Kang" steamer, sailing from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 27th, the Jardine "Ri Sheng" steamer, sailing from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 28th, the Taikoo "Tai Yuan" steamer, the Jardine "Yong Sheng" steamer sailing from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Haiphong on the 29th, and the Taikoo "Sichuan" steamer will still call at Shantou, but whether they can enter the port is another matter.</p>
<h3>World YMCA Representatives to Go Abroad at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Reviewing the Current World Situation, Engaging in Peace Movement</p>
<p>Five organizations, including the World Council of Churches International Friendship Association, the World YMCA, the World Christian Life and Work Committee, and the World Student Christian Federation, are concerned about the expansion of militarism and armaments, which have brought international tensions to a climax.</p>
<p>Therefore, they initiated the World Christian Youth Conference, scheduled to be held from July 24th to August 1st in Amsterdam, inviting 1,500 young Christian men and women aged 18 to 35 from over 40 countries to participate. China can send 30 delegates, including 11 from churches, 10 from the YMCA, 4 from the YWCA, and 5 students.</p>

Delegates from various parts of China are scheduled to come to Shanghai within days and go abroad by ship together at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Transactions All Follow New Price Limits, Rice Market Order Stabilizes; Domestic Rice Source Mainly Wuhu; Authorities to Meet Today to Stabilize Rice Market</h3>
<p>Since the standard rice prices were set, all 105 firms in the bean and rice market have complied, so transactions are becoming more active and the volume of transactions is increasing. Domestic rice supply has increased slightly recently, mainly from Wuhu and other places. The rice management committee of the concession authorities will convene a meeting today. Since the standard price limits were set, the citizens have benefited greatly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Firm Transactions Follow Price Limits</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council, in conjunction with rice industry leaders, set a new rice price limit not to exceed 21 yuan, and the joint meeting of rice industry organizations decided on the standard prices for each rice grade, market transactions have become regularized and order has returned to normal. All 105 firms have complied with the newly set price limits, buying and selling among themselves. The bean and rice market opened at 9 AM yesterday and closed at 12 PM. The situation is improving. However, because hoarders are becoming more active and consumption is relatively strong, the price of ordinary thick and thin japonica rice increased by 10 to 20 cents compared to the previous day. This is a very ordinary occurrence and not surprising. Yesterday morning, approximately 8,000 bags were traded in total.</p>
<p>Domestic Rice Source Mainly Wuhu</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the market that in recent days, due to rain all day, the supply of domestic rice has decreased again. However, because of repeated incidents in other rice-producing areas, vendors have been hesitant to purchase. They have all gone to Wuhu, Suzhou, and other places to purchase rice, so there are many rice shipments to Shanghai from these two places. Their prices are all below the rice price limit in Shanghai, so rice firms can still profit from purchasing this white rice. Yesterday, there were still no arrivals from Hexia. About 2,000 bags of rice from Chelin, Baozi, Tongli, and Fengjing were shipped to Shanghai. This was all due to the rain.</p>
<p>Authorities Meet to Stabilize Rice Market</p>
<p>The two concession authorities have always paid close attention to the food supply within the concessions. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, with the westward movement of the National Army, the two concessions have become isolated islands with a special environment. It is difficult to improve domestic rice supply because the producing areas have all become war zones. Recently, rice prices soared, and the Municipal Council, recognizing that rice is a daily necessity for all citizens, rich and poor, summoned rice industry representatives to discuss price limits to curb the rising trend. It is reported that the concession rice management committee is scheduled to convene a committee meeting at 2 PM this afternoon. At that time, it will discuss strongly urging rice firms to comply with the newly set price limits for buying and selling, and dispatching additional personnel to the market to maintain order and improve domestic rice supply.</p>
<p>Price Limits Benefit Citizens</p>
<p>The price of rice in Shanghai previously soared due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates and the occurrence of the Tianjin and Gulangyu incidents. Some unscrupulous rice merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, and the rising trend was quite fierce for a time. The price of top-grade white rice rose from 20 yuan to 24 yuan, seriously affecting the livelihoods of ordinary people. Later, the authorities intervened, repeatedly calling rice industry representatives to discuss curbing the rising trend of rice prices and setting a maximum price limit for white rice of no more than 21 yuan per stone. Since the implementation of the new price limit, the price of rice has fallen back, and standard prices have also been set for each rice grade. Therefore, the poor citizens of the city have benefited greatly and deeply thank the Municipal Council and rice industry leaders for their proper handling of the situation and for relieving the hardships of the poor.</p>
<h3>Foresight of American Residents in Shanghai; Recruiting Members for Merchant Corps; To Assist in Defense When Needed; American Chamber of Commerce Appeals to Members</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Da Mei Evening Post," the American Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps needs more recruits. Many believe that in the current turbulent state of this part of the world, the American residents here are very concerned about having a well-organized and trained American volunteer force to assist in the defense of this city when needed. The current strength of the American Company is only fifty men, but at least one hundred are needed to make it an</p>
<p>effective unit</p>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce has recently appealed to all its members for the company. The notice issued by the Chamber of Commerce states that the number of drills is guaranteed to be reduced to the minimum necessary, and the training time will not interfere with the necessary affairs of the members. Even in emergencies and mobilizations, arrangements are often made so that key personnel in the business community can take care of their business interests. As for individuals, the training includes guidance and</p>
<p>practical horsemanship</p>
<p>giving members the opportunity to indulge in this beneficial and enjoyable exercise throughout the year. Managers of commercial firms are especially requested to support this matter and to draw the attention of their American staff to it. American staff are also requested to pass on the needs of the American Company to others who are concerned. Any American who has not joined the civilian service is requested to join the American Company immediately.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Fellow-Provincials Association Seeks Members</h3>
<p>Pei Yunqing, Huang Yuzhai, and Others Deliver Insightful Speeches</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Fellow-Provincials Association in this city was founded in the year before the founding of the Republic and has always handled public welfare, charity, and education matters without lagging behind, making it one of the most famous fellow-provincial organizations. Since the Shanghai war, members have moved and scattered, and the number of fellow-provincials from the interior who have come to Shanghai to seek refuge is quite large. Therefore, it is necessary to hold an eighth membership recruitment meeting. The executive and supervisory committee resolved to appoint Pei Yunqing as the chief commander, Pan Jiufen, Hu Yixiang, He Gusheng, and Yan Chengde as deputy chief commanders, Wang Juru as the chief of staff, Huang Yuzhai and Xu Xiajun as deputy chiefs of staff, Zhang Yiqu and Qian Youlan as secretaries, and over two hundred people as captains. The membership fees are still divided into four types: permanent membership fee of 100 yuan, supporting membership fee of 20 yuan, special membership fee of 5 yuan, and ordinary membership fee of 2 yuan. The recruitment period will be one month, starting from July 1st.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon (the 25th), a banquet was held at Yijia Chun Cai Restaurant. In addition to the chief and deputy commanders, the chief and deputy chiefs of staff, and the secretaries, the captains present included Yuan Ludeng, He Wuliang, Gong Moda, Shen Jingliang, Li Fuxun, Hu Chuqing, Xu Qianlin, Chen Qiushan, Qi Ziquan, Feng Zhongqing, Zhao Chuanding, Lu Zhinan, Jiang Quanmao, and over one hundred others. During the banquet, Chief Commander Pei Yunqing delivered a speech, stating that the people of Shaoxing are known for their indomitable and pragmatic spirit and have always enjoyed a good reputation in Shanghai. This eighth recruitment meeting is a good opportunity to show our ability. The officials of this meeting are all well-known figures in various industries, who are enthusiastic about social service and have always been passionate. The success of this recruitment, surpassing previous sessions, can be predicted. Finally, he reported on</p>
<p>past achievements</p>
<p>for reference. Then, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Xu Xiajun and Huang Yuzhai delivered speeches, with many insightful remarks. Xu said that human life is no more than a hundred years, but only by striving for social causes and establishing immortal achievements can one leave a name for posterity. Huang said that this eighth recruitment of the association coincides with the Ministry of Finance's renewed restrictions on withdrawals, causing temporary market unrest, which may have a significant impact on the recruitment efforts. However, we should seek a way out in a difficult environment to show our greatness. He also said that the recruitment target should be fellow-provincials from all levels of society. Finally, he said that the association has historically had few female members and hoped that everyone would mobilize, including their wives, to create unprecedentedly satisfactory results. The banquet ended at 3 PM.</p>
<h3>Positive Opinion of German Newspaper on Tianjin Incident; Must Be Considered from a Political Standpoint; Difficult to Defend Allies</h3>
<p>The "Continental News" reported that the local German newspaper "Ostasialischer Lloyd," which inclines toward the National Socialist Party, published a lengthy editorial yesterday (the 25th) on the Tianjin incident. The main points were: Germans in China must observe the Tianjin incident from the side, because it involves a larger political dispute. It also stated that the English in Tianjin fought with patience, discipline, and perseverance, which is admirable. Although there are reasons why it is often difficult to defend one's allies, Germans in the Far East must observe the Anglo-Japanese dispute from the perspective of a larger political dispute. Berlin newspapers have placed the names Danzig and Tianjin together, and everyone must know what that means. We do not applaud the Tianjin incident, and we certainly will not do so. We only observe this matter as part of a larger political competition that is currently underway. We must deal with the events in Tianjin calmly and consider these events only from the perspective of a larger dispute. How will these disputes be resolved? It all depends on Germany.</p>
<h3>Securities Gray Market to Open on July 4th; Difficulty in Settlement Due to Lack of Current Chips</h3>
<p>Since Chongqing telegraphed the suspension of interest payments on customs-secured bonds, the price of unified public bonds in Shanghai's securities gray market has fallen. Then, due to the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting withdrawals, the securities gray market temporarily suspended trading for two and a half days from the afternoon of the 22nd to handle the settlement of previously traded goods. It was originally planned to open yesterday, but after informal brokers met at 10 AM yesterday, they decided to wait until after the banks' semi-annual settlement, i.e., July 4th, to resume trading due to the lack of cash chips. Today's Shanghai securities gray market is completely different from the previous Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The prices in the gray market are entirely controlled by speculators, and the prices of each bond are not considered to be official market prices.</p>
<h3>The Fallen Area Advocates Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>Living Reduced to the Bare Minimum, Almost No Interaction with Towns</p>
<p>Since the "Huaxing Bank" issued banknotes, attempting to acquire legal tender and absorb resources from our fallen areas, the government has taken effective measures to resist. The people in the fallen areas have unanimously implemented a policy of self-sufficiency, unwilling to engage in economic relations with the Japanese, thereby striking at this economic invasion scheme. According to those who came to Shanghai from the fallen areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, broad beans and wheat in the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are now on the market, but farmers, due to the Japanese frantically purchasing, are storing them and converting them into grain. Some farm families are even grinding broad beans into powder for fertilizer due to the high price of fertilizer. Farmers cherish legal tender, and only when absolutely necessary are they willing to sell. Bartering also occurs in transactions. The rural economy in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which have been the most severely affected by disasters, is in difficulty, and consumption has been reduced to the bare minimum needed to sustain life. Being able to have coarse clothing and simple meals is sufficient, and there is almost no interaction with cities. County governments in various counties continue to perform their duties as usual, guiding farmers, engaging in self-defense, and promoting rural handicrafts to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
<h3>The Relief Society Plans to Establish a Civilian Construction Factory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Aftermath Committee recently held its tenth committee meeting at its Guang Dong Road headquarters. The attending committee members included Yu Zuoting, Jiang Yiping, Pan Yangyao, Xu Guanqun, Xi Yushu, Li Wenjie, Xiang Kangyuan, etc. The chairman, Wei Bozhen, first reported on the committee's affairs, and then began to discuss the proposal to establish a civilian construction factory project for approval. It was resolved that the civilian construction factory project would be sent to the next standing committee meeting for discussion, and Chen Heqin, director of the work training group of the education department, and Pan Yangyao and Xiang Kangyuan, deputy directors of the production construction group of the aftermath department, were invited to attend.</p>
<h3>Bishop Roberts and His Wife Suddenly Robbed by Bandits. More Than 1,500 Yuan in Cash and Jewelry Was Stolen. The Bandits Fled with the Loot into the "Great Way" Area. Although Detectives Rushed to Search, They Were Unable to Capture Them.</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that recently, thugs from areas outside the Public Concession have repeatedly attacked Chinese and foreigners in the Che Gu Road area of ​​western Shanghai. Yesterday (the 25th) afternoon, armed bandits committed the latest act of violence in the area, blocking Bishop Roberts and his wife's car in broad daylight, robbing them of cash and jewelry worth more than 1,500 yuan. As in previous cases, the bandits fled with the loot.</p>
<p>They did not harm Mr. and Mrs. Roberts. They immediately returned to their car and reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Police officers rushed to the scene and found that the bandits had escaped into a "Great Way" area and were safely hiding. Yesterday's robbery was committed by five Chinese, two of whom were armed. It was 4:55 p.m. Bishop Roberts, who is the representative of the St. John's University board of directors in China, and his wife were driving to St. John's University, where they reside.</p>
<p>As the car was proceeding along the Railway Station Road, five people suddenly stood in front of the car, pointing guns at the Roberts and forcing them to stop. The three bandits who were not carrying weapons then stepped forward to search the Roberts' wallets and Mrs. Roberts' handbags for cash, robbed them of jewelry, and searched the car. After the robbery, they did not hurt the Roberts and quickly fled. The Roberts then drove quickly to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report the robbery. The police station urgently dispatched a team of police officers to try to capture the thieves.</p>
<p>Although they arrived at the scene shortly after 5 p.m. and searched the surrounding area, all the bandits had returned to the "Great Way" area. At the time, the bandits pointed guns at them, and the Roberts were unable to call the police. Not far away, there was a British soldier stationed at Major General Simmons' residence on Railway Station Road. According to Mr. and Mrs. Roberts, the thieves all spoke with a Shanghai accent and broken English, and seemed to belong to the coolie class.</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Police Station is continuing its investigation. Recently, there have been many cases of bandits running rampant in the area, and many complaints have been filed with the Jing'an Temple Police Station. It is reported that Bishop Roberts is the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and is also a leading figure in the American Episcopal Church in China, and enjoys a high reputation in Shanghai and other parts of China.</p>
<h3>The Relief Society's Ballroom Group Hosts a Charity Tea Dance</h3>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Ballroom Group, in order to expand fundraising efforts and enrich disaster relief funds, decided through a standing committee meeting to hold a citywide charity tea dance competition. Yuan Ludeng was elected as the chairman, and Gao Xinshi and Xie Baosheng as the vice-chairmen. Ren Jinping, Shao Xubai, Wei Meizhang, Cheng Keguang, Zhang Bofang, and others are in charge of preparations and are actively carrying out the work. All preparations are now complete, and the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held on July 1 at the Ciro's ballroom, lasting for one month. All the famous stars and all the dance stars of the major dance halls in the city have unanimously mobilized to participate, and the enthusiasm is very high. In recent days, major companies, manufacturers, and enthusiastic people from all walks of life have sent valuable gifts. The association has also consulted with Wing On Company to display all the gifts, awards, etc., in the company's windows for public viewing and encouragement.</p>
<h3>The Postal Administration Resumes Parcel Service to the Dongchuan Postal District</h3>
<p>The Parcel Business Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday morning stating: (1) The acceptance of large parcels destined for various places south of Yiliang along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway in Yunnan Province, except for personal and medicinal parcels, will be temporarily suspended from June 26 of this year. (2) The acceptance of large parcels destined for various places in the Dongchuan postal district (excluding Bazhong, Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Youyang, Xiushan, and Longtan, etc.) will resume from June 26 of this year. However, due to transportation difficulties, for parcels destined for the above-mentioned areas, except for personal educational and medicinal parcels, a tax declaration list must be submitted to the Parcel Business Section for stamping one day in advance before they can be accepted for posting. Small postal items will also resume acceptance on the 26th. According to reports, the Dongchuan postal district includes Chongqing, Jiangbei, Jiangjin, Yingshan, Guang'an, Qianjiang, Pengshui, Wanxian, Fengdu, Liangshan, Yongchuan, Changshou, Yunyang, Kaijiang, Hechuan, and other places. It is also reported that Chengdu parcels will resume this week, and all parcels and letters to the above-mentioned areas will be forwarded through Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Newly Built British River Gunboats Await Orders to Sail to the Yangtze River. The Ships Are Named Scorpion, Dragonfly, and Grasshopper. The Grasshopper Arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday Afternoon.</h3>
<p>Three newly built river gunboats of the British Yangtze River Fleet in China have been completed. The Scorpion and Dragonfly have already arrived in Shanghai to join the fleet. The third ship, the Grasshopper, also arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at about 5 p.m. yesterday and immediately sailed into the Huangpu River, mooring at the Naval Pontoon off Yangjingbang. The new gunboat Dragonfly, which was originally moored at the pontoon, was moved to the Yangshupu Ruiyong Shipyard wharf yesterday afternoon before the Grasshopper arrived.

<h3>Gambling Dens are Extremely Harmful. Shop Assistant is Thrown in Jail. He Sold Silver Fungus and Sent All the Money to Gambling Dens. Unable to Bear Being a Vagrant, He Finally Surrendered Himself.</h3>
<p>Xia Dongsheng, a shop assistant at the Renshoutang Pharmacy in western Shanghai, has been gambling frequently since the establishment of various gambling venues in the western district, as they are located very close by. Over time, he accumulated more and more debts, and his meager salary was not enough to support his reckless spending. There was a resident named Shi Meiseng, who worked in the financial industry, near the pharmacy. Shi's wife often went to the store to buy medicine, and Xia became acquainted with her and chatted with her. He learned that Shi had relatives in Sichuan and often sent Sichuan-produced silver fungus to Shanghai, asking Shi to sell it on his behalf. Xia saw this as an opportunity and used the excuse of being responsible for sales as a way to approach her. Last Wednesday, he claimed to Shi's family that he would take eight catties of silver fungus, worth more than 550 yuan in national currency, and sell it to Xuzhongdao Pharmacy and other places. The money he obtained was sent to the Lihuilu, Hollywood, and Rongsheng gambling dens, where he lost everything. From then on, he dared not return to the store and lived a vagrant life. Until 3 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 24th), he suddenly felt like a floating duckweed, and finally could not bear it. He surrendered himself to the Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge and confessed his guilt. The police chief had already received a report from the owner of the silver fungus and was ordering Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate Xia's whereabouts. Since he had surrendered himself, detectives went to various stores, such as Xuzhongdao, who had bought the stolen goods based on his confession, and retrieved the original stolen goods. Yesterday morning, the owner of the stolen goods was summoned, and Xia was sent to the First Special District Local Court along with the stolen goods for interrogation. First, the police station's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated the case. Shi Meiseng recounted the experience of being deceived. Judge Zhong interrogated Xia Dongsheng and confirmed that he had deceived him with the silver fungus and gambled away the money. The court then sentenced him to three months in prison and ordered the stolen goods to be returned to the original owner.</p>
<h3>Husband Angry at Wife's Infidelity. He Lured Her into an Inn and Stabbed Her. He Did Not Escape After the Attack, But Waited Quietly to be Arrested. Please Investigate the Woman's Behavior on Weekdays, So as to Determine the Severity of the Defendant's Crime.</h3>
<p>He Shiqing, a native of Shaoxing, 30 years old, worked as a salesman at the Maomao Plush Shop at 11 Rue des Soeurs in the French Concession. Five years ago, he married a fellow Shaoxing woman, Hu (23 years old), as his wife. They lived together at 3 Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession. Hu was accustomed to a modern lifestyle and had a romantic demeanor. Recently, she had become restless and went out all day, not returning until late at night. Sometimes, she even stayed overnight outside. He discovered that his wife's actions were clearly indicative of an affair. He gave his wife household expenses every month, but she often complained that it was not enough, causing their marital relationship to become strained. Although he repeatedly advised her, she was never able to change her behavior. He was extremely angry and, on the evening of the 23rd, on the pretext that the house was stuffy, took her to the Asia Hotel at 571 Hankou Road and booked room 148, where they stayed overnight. At about 8 a.m. on the 24th, while she was still asleep, he sneaked out and bought a kitchen knife. He immediately slashed at her face and other parts of her head. His purpose was to disfigure her so that no one would pursue her again. She was awakened by the attack and resisted, causing multiple injuries to her neck and hands. At this time, he could have escaped, but he did not do so. He stood in the room without moving. The hotel waiter reported to the Laozha Police Station, which immediately ordered Chinese detective Song Wenqing to rush to the scene and arrest him. Hu was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted him for serious injury and stated that, according to the defendant's confession at the police station, he committed this heinous act because Hu's behavior was improper and she was having an affair, which angered him. This is the cause of the defendant's crime and has a significant impact on the severity of the future sentence. Therefore, it should be investigated. Therefore, this case should be postponed. When questioned, the defendant's confession remained the same as before. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing. He also ordered that the injuries to He and Hu be identified by a forensic doctor, and that the police conduct a detailed investigation into the daily behavior of He and Hu.</p>
<h3>"Hitler's Dream" Published</h3>
<p>This book was written by Mr. Lorimer. The content is divided into three parts. The first part is the principles of "Mein Kampf." Everyone knows that Hitler's book "Mein Kampf" was used as the "Bible" of Nazi Germany. The original book is cumbersome and difficult to read. Now, Mr. Lorimer has extracted its essence, and after reading it, we can understand the general idea of ​​this "Nazi Bible." The second part is Rosenberg's "The Myth of the Twentieth Century." This is the second "Bible" of Nazi Germany. In Germany, it was as popular as "Mein Kampf." The original book is also quite lengthy and difficult to understand. Now, Mr. Lorimer has reduced the text to one chapter. The third part is the implementation of Nazism. There is a detailed description of the foreign policy of Nazism, as well as the prison "concentration camp" that shocked the world. This book has now been translated by Messrs. Zhefei and Balun. The translation is fluent and it is truly a good leisure reading material for summer. It is available in major bookstores and newsstands.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the US Dollar Fraud Case. Yao Ruilian and Chen Lingmei Each Sentenced to One and a Half Years in Prison. Dancer Wanruo Lili Declared Not Guilty and Released.</h3>
<p>Yao Ruilian, who was originally a lawyer, designed a scheme to defraud the Baotai Bank on Sichuan Road of 1,500 US dollars in November last year because her Yongan Bank was experiencing financial difficulties. The case was exposed, and Chief Inspector Jiang Shangpei and Detective Zhou Kaiwen of the General Patrol Room arrested Yao and Chen, along with Chen's mistress Shen Lili, Zhang Chaohan, Liu Gengsun, etc., and sent them to the First Special Court. Multiple interrogations have been completed, and Judge Meng Tingke of the trial court announced the verdict in Court No. 4 yesterday morning. The main text of the verdict stated that Chen Lingmei and Yao Ruilian jointly used fraud to cause others to deliver property and were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. Zhang Chaohan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for hiding stolen goods. Liu Gengsun was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment for continuously receiving stolen goods. Shen Lili was not guilty. The attached civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. Two hundred and twenty-three yuan of goods was ordered to be confiscated.

<h3>The Owner of the Huizhong Inn is Accused of Assault by His Wife. The Defendant's Lawyer Raised the Issue of Jurisdiction. Citing Previous Examples, He Requested a Ruling for Further Review.</h3>
<p>Sun Bo, the owner of the Huizhong Inn on Hankou Road, currently resides with his wife, Fei, at 15, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, western Yunnan. At 7 p.m. on the 12th of this month, Sun and Fei had a conflict at home over an invitation to a friend's banquet. As a result, Sun's arm was injured. She reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent a detective to the Guangren Hospital to verify the injury before filing a lawsuit against Sun in the First Special District Local Court for causing bodily harm. Judge Zhong Qing summoned both parties to court yesterday morning for investigation. First, the police lawyer stated the case, saying that according to Sun Baoshu's report, this was the second time he had been beaten. After the first beating on May 4, relatives mediated and they reconciled. However, he was soon treated this way again, so he had to sue. Sun showed the injury on his arm in court. Sun's lawyer, Zhang Yuanmei, then argued that the defendant's address was not within the scope of the Public Concession, so the police station had no jurisdiction over the case. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated that although the location was not within the concession, the Supreme Court had ruled in previous cases that the court could accept the case under the current circumstances. The defendant's lawyer then also requested that the court cite previous examples and request a ruling on jurisdiction from a higher level. The court approved the request and ordered that the hearing be adjourned for further review.</p>
<h3>A Fake Policeman Arrested Someone Without Authorization and Was Released Immediately.</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that Dr. Wu (transliteration), who lives at 17 Yiding Road, reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station at 3 p.m. on Saturday that a "Great Way" policeman had entered his residence and arrested him a few minutes earlier, but released him before being taken to the "Great Way" police station. When asked if he knew the reason why the "Great Way" authorities wanted to arrest him, Dr. Wu said he did not. Yesterday (the 25th), someone inquired with the Jing'an Temple detectives about this case, but nothing was heard. It is said that the "Great Way" police actually wanted to arrest someone else, but mistakenly arrested Dr. Wu. It is heard that Dr. Wu's residence faces a public concession road, and his house is under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession Police Department.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>(1) To the Editor: I am writing in response to a news item in your esteemed newspaper, the Shen Bao, dated the 26th, in the "Local News" column, titled "Technician Resigns from Machinery Factory, Sues Shareholders for Defamation." The report contains inaccuracies and is not in line with the true facts. I, Xu Fusheng, was formerly employed as the technician at the Tianhua Machinery Factory, which I co-founded with Cao Zuochen and others. However, Cao Zuochen, due to his exclusionary tendencies, caused me to be dismissed from my position. To make a living, I then took a position as a technician at the Zhenji Machinery Factory. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd of last month, I received a letter from a lawyer representing Cao Zuochen, informing me that my shares in Tianhua Machinery Factory were being withdrawn on the grounds that I was engaged in a business similar to Tianhua Machinery Factory. Yet, on the 25th, Cao Zuochen publicly published a defamatory advertisement with the intent to maliciously damage my reputation. People along the river believe Cao Zuochen intentionally slandered me, so I have filed a lawsuit in court. The report stated, "Subsequently, Xu also partnered with a Ji-surnamed shareholder to establish the Jiji Machinery Factory" and "Xu then withdrew his shares," all of which is utter nonsense. While I was supposedly removed by a so-called unanimous resolution of a shareholders' meeting of Cao Zuochen, this meeting was conducted without prior notification or invitation for me to attend, rendering it manifestly illegal. As such, the resolution resulting from this unlawful meeting is not binding upon me in any way. Therefore, I remain a shareholder of Tianhua Machinery Factory, and there is no truth to the claim that I withdrew my shares. As for the claim that "Xu also partnered with a Ji-surnamed shareholder to establish the Ji Machinery Factory," this is even more fabricated. I am employed by Zhenji Machinery Factory. Zhenji Machinery Factory has been established for more than twenty years, with its main factory in Hankou and branches in Changsha and Shanghai, making it a large and well-established enterprise. It cannot be compared to Tianhua Machinery Factory, which has only been in operation for three to five years. The report that I partnered with a Ji-surnamed shareholder to establish the Ji Machinery Factory is incorrect as I do not know where such factory is located. This news report is manifestly erroneous. Therefore, I have retained a lawyer to request a letter of correction from your esteemed newspaper and to publish a clarification. Accordingly, this letter is sent to you, and I hope you will publish it to clarify the facts. I will be deeply grateful for your impartiality. Respectfully submitted to the editor of Shen Bao. Lawyer Shen Zongyong, June 26th.</p>
<p>(2) To the Editor: We, the lawyers, hereby submit on behalf of our clients, Mr. and Mrs. Peng Hanzhang, that in reference to the assault against Mr. and Mrs. Peng, the Shen Bao recently published a letter from one Huang Guisong, which contains statements that are entirely inconsistent with the truth. The claims made are deliberately false and designed to inflict malicious harm to the reputation of Mr. and Mrs. Peng, so as to evade criminal liability. Therefore, we present a detailed account of the events in order to avoid any misunderstandings. Mr. Huang Zhenxiang was introduced by Mr. Peng in September of last year and took the position of accountant at the Hongfu Yuan Restaurant in Hongkou, which was jointly established by Mr. Peng. Later, Huang Zhenxiang assaulted the restaurant's cook, leading to his dismissal by the restaurant. This past March, Huang Zhenxiang voluntarily resigned from his position. However, Huang Zhenxiang was unaware of his own misdeeds and instead harbored a grudge against Mr. Peng. On the evening of the 24th of this month, at approximately 11:00 p.m., Huang Zhenxiang, armed with a weapon, waited at the entrance of No. 18 Tianjin Road. When Mr. and Mrs. Peng emerged, Huang Zhenxiang launched a violent attack, stabbing Mr. Peng four times in the abdomen. Mrs. Li, Peng's wife, was stabbed once in the abdomen. Both immediately began to bleed profusely and lost consciousness. Passersby apprehended Huang Zhenxiang, and a knife sheath was found on his person. Mr. Peng was transported to Tongren Hospital on Erma Road, and Mrs. Li was transported to Shanghai Sanatorium for medical treatment. Their injuries are serious, and they remain hospitalized to this day. These are the true facts, which can be easily verified. Therefore, there is no validity to the claims that Mr. and Mrs. Peng attempted to commit violence against Huang. The statements made by Huang Guisong in his letter to Shen Bao are obviously motivated by other agendas. We have been specifically retained to submit a letter to your newspaper to clarify the truth and to prevent any misunderstandings. Accordingly, we are sending this letter to you on their behalf, and we hope you will investigate and publish a correction in the "Letter to the Editor" column. Respectfully submitted to the editor of Shen Bao. Lawyer Xi Shichang, June 26th.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Continue Unified Admissions for National Universities This Summer; Country Divided into Fifteen Admission Districts Including Shanghai; This Year's Procedures Differ from Last Year in Five Aspects</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 26th Dispatch) To adapt to the special environment and needs of the wartime period and to comprehensively coordinate the admissions of national universities, the Ministry of Education organized unified admissions for national universities last year, which proved to be satisfactory. For the 28th academic year, the freshmen (excluding special training program students) of national universities and independent colleges will still be admitted and allocated to various national universities by the Ministry of Education through unified admissions. The admissions of provincial and private universities and independent colleges, as well as public and private vocational schools, will continue to follow the previous practice of submitting applications to the Ministry of Education for approval before conducting their own admissions. The members of the 28th academic year National Universities Unified Admissions Committee have been appointed by the Ministry of Education, including Luo Jialun, Wang Xinggong, Cheng Tianfang, Shi Qifang, Ye Yuanlong, Wu Nanxuan, Zhou Binglin, Tong Guanxian, Ai Wei, Chen Shizhen, Chen Panzao, Xie Xunchu, Zhang Yi, Wu Junsheng, Gu Shusen, Chen Lijiang, Hao Gengsheng, Huang Longxian, and Wang Wanzhong, a total of nineteen members. Wu Junsheng has been designated as the chairman of the committee, and Chen Dongyuan as the secretary. This year, the unified admissions will be divided into fifteen admission districts, including Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanzheng, Kunming, Guiyang, Chenxi, Guilin, Yanping, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Enshi, Taihe, Yongkang, Qujiang, and Zhenping. Branch locations will be established in Hechuan, Baisha, Leshan, Wugong, Ankang, Tongren, Suoli, Lantian, Hong Kong, and other places. The registration period is scheduled from July 25th to the 30th. The examination dates are scheduled from August 7th to the 10th. The differences between this year's unified admissions procedures and those of last year are as follows: (1) The examination questions this year will be uniformly prepared and distributed by the Ministry of Education. (2) In distributing students, in addition to using the applicant's preferences and scores as the basis for allocation, this year's procedures will also prioritize allocation based on the examination district and nearby schools. If the schools in that district are full or there are no preferred departments, the Ministry of Education will designate a school. (3) Students who are not admitted but have scores that are not too low will be admitted by the Ministry of Education into the university preparatory classes. (4) Students who are admitted without examination will be limited to the top 10% of the current year's high school graduates who have passed the joint graduation examination and are recommended by the provincial departments of education. National high schools and provinces that do not conduct joint examinations will not be allowed to make recommendations based on precedent. (5) The number of students admitted with equivalent academic qualifications this year will not exceed 10% of the total number of students admitted in each district and will be limited to the top half of the total number of students admitted in each district.</p>
<h3>General Overview of Broadcasting Education in the Four Nations Over the Past Three Years (2)</h3>
<p>#### Administrative Organization and Specialist Management Cultivating Talents for Various Provinces to Emulate</p>
<p>Administrative Organization</p>
<p>The broadcasting education enterprise is relatively new, and its administrative status is yet to be fully established. However, to promote the enterprise, it is necessary to define its administrative position. At the central level, the Ministry of Education will invite scholars, experts, and relevant members of various ministries to form a broadcasting education committee, dedicated to the design of the enterprise and technical consultation. The Department of Social Education will establish two to three full-time staff members to handle administrative and broadcasting matters. At the local level, the education departments or bureaus of various provinces and cities will establish broadcasting education service centers to plan for the promotion of broadcasting and to assemble and repair phonographs for various counties. They will divide the provinces and cities into several broadcasting education districts according to their environment and circumstances. Each district will be assigned a supervisor by the education departments or bureaus, responsible for supervising, evaluating, and guiding the implementation of broadcasting, as well as providing technical assistance. Within the education departments or bureaus, one or two staff members will also be designated to handle administrative matters related to broadcasting education. By linking these efforts from the top to the bottom and working together, the enterprise can be implemented more easily. Starting in the 27th academic year, the Ministry of Education established a radio technician position to handle technical matters and guide radio-related affairs in various provinces. The education departments of various provinces also increased the number of technical personnel to handle technical matters and guide radio-related affairs in various counties.</p>
<p>Talent Cultivation</p>
<p>The administrative demand for talent as described above is extremely urgent. The Ministry of Education opened a training class for wireless radio instructors for secondary schools and mass education centers nationwide in July of the 24th year. In September of the 25th year, it opened the first training class for electro-educational personnel. In July of the 26th year, it continued to run the second training class for electro-educational personnel. Education departments and bureaus from various provinces and cities recommended students to be trained in film and broadcasting groups. After completing their training, the students returned to their original education departments and bureaus to be assigned to specialize in film and broadcasting education administration, or to be appointed as educational film projectionists and broadcasting education instructors. After the Ministry of Education moved to Chongqing, it continued to run the third training class for electro-educational personnel, starting in July of the 27th year. Training lasted two months and included sixty-six people in the film and broadcasting groups. In total, the four classes graduated more than three hundred people. Provinces that established their own training classes to train this type of personnel included Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and others.</p>
<p>Recognizing that purchasing radios was expensive and time-consuming, the Ministry of Education ordered the broadcasting education committee to establish a small-scale factory to manufacture radios themselves. Originally, it was planned to produce a thousand radios in the 26th academic year. However, after the outbreak of war, eighty radios were hastily completed and distributed to various military hospitals in the capital. Subsequently, the committee was ordered to move west, and all completed and unfinished machines and parts were transported out, first stored in the Hunan Education Department, and recently transported to Sichuan. To complete the original plan and provide technical consultation on radio technology, the Ministry of Education signed a cooperation agreement with the College of Science of Jinling University. The college would be responsible for inspecting and matching parts, testing radios, and answering technical questions about radios from various provinces and cities. The Ministry of Education would subsidize the college with 200 yuan per month for handling fees, labor, and material consumption until all the machines were assembled.</p>
<p>Purchasing and Distributing Batteries</p>
<p>Remote and impoverished provinces and cities, as well as small cities or villages without electricity, are equipped with direct current dry dynamos. The supply of power is a challenge. The Ministry of Education ordered the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to report the types and quantities of dry batteries needed in order to approve the distribution of batteries. This item was originally handled in the same way as full or half subsidies for radios. After the outbreak of war, it was difficult for provinces and cities to raise funds and procure batteries, so the Ministry of Education uniformly ordered them from the electrical machinery factory of the Resources Committee to be distributed as a full subsidy, making it more convenient for the northwest and southwest provinces to procure batteries. The Ministry of Education also requested the Resources Committee to establish dry battery factories in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shaanxi and Gansu to meet urgent needs. The Ministry of Education has subsidized various provinces and cities with dry batteries over the years, totaling 600 sets nationwide in the 24th academic year, 530 sets in the 25th academic year, 203 sets in the 26th academic year, and 475 sets in the 27th academic year, for a total of 2,707 sets.</p>
<p>Publishing Lecture Manuscripts</p>
<p>To compensate for the shortcomings of broadcasting and to ensure its universal and lasting effectiveness, the Ministry of Education has published broadcasting manuscripts in four ways: (1) Distributing mimeographed copies to radio stations across the country for broadcasting on special educational holidays and sending them to major newspapers for publication in special columns. (2) Printing important and relatively systematic lecture manuscripts without time sensitivity into special volumes and distributing them to education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities for distribution to radio organizations and various sectors for reference. Eight types have been published, including common sense of air defense and common sense of poison prevention. (3) Starting in July of the 26th year, broadcasting materials were focused on the issue of resistance against Japan. Important lecture manuscripts were compiled into small books on anti-Japanese war education broadcasting. (4) To facilitate research on the administration of broadcasting education and to introduce broadcasting education lecture manuscripts, the Broadcasting Education Monthly was edited and published by the Shanghai Commercial Press. After the war broke out, publication was temporarily suspended due to printing difficulties. A total of ten issues in the first volume were published. (4) Compiling and printing collections of educational broadcasting lectures is also a way to publish lecture manuscripts. At the end of each academic year, all lecture manuscripts within the academic year are compiled into special collections by secondary schools and mass education centers. One volume for secondary schools and two volumes for mass education centers have been published. Continued printing has now been suspended due to printing difficulties. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Wimbledon Opens Curtain Men's and Women's Championship Predictions Austin and Marble Highly Touted Xu Chengji Also Has a Good Chance</h3>
<p>(London, 25th, United Press Dispatch) The 59th Wimbledon World Tennis Championships are scheduled to open on Monday. According to general betting predictions, Austin and Miss Marble of the United States will win the men's and women's singles championships, respectively. The odds of their victory are two to one. In the men's group, Riggs and McNeill are the most highly touted. In the women's group, it is Miss Jacobs. The men's and women's champions of the previous year will not be playing to defend their titles, which is a first in 80 years. At least six people have the hope of winning the championship. Although Austin and Riggs suffered惨败 in the Queen's Club singles competition, experts still predict that they will reach the finals, as Austin is experienced in Wimbledon. Austin himself said that Riggs is more promising. Judging from McNeill's recent performances in India, Egypt, Germany, and other places, he is also very promising. Among European players, Yugoslavia's Pensek has a better chance than Henkel and Mansel. Poland's Rochaski defeated Henkel and Meng in the Davis Cup. Chinese player Xu Chengji also has great hope since winning the All-England Hard Court Championship and defeating Austin. However, his recent performance in the Davis Cup in Paris was disappointing. Xu has different types of strokes and perfect ball control, but if it is a five-set match, it may diminish his chances. In the women's group, in addition to Marble, Mrs. Liddell (formerly Miss Round), Mrs. Mathieu of France, Mrs. Sperling of Denmark, and Miss Jerschoska of Poland are promising.

<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange Selling Pressure Remains Unabated, Sino-Japanese Commercial Banks Continue to Sell Off</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. In the unofficial market, because Japanese commercial banks and Chinese banks, as well as foreign-funded Indian bank companies, were competing fiercely, the market continued to show a firm trend. Although foreign firms came to support in the middle, because non-bank institutions were willing to sell, it was not affected. As a result, both British and American exchange rates increased, and trading was still active. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was quite loose at first, but later, as foreign firms' willingness to sell increased, it softened slightly, but ultimately rose by 0.025.</p>
<p>Indian Bank Corporation Also Sells Off</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London large-value long-term and short-term contracts both rose by 0.01875. The New York silver price remained stable, and the London spot gold price also remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies was still flat, 0.015 higher against Shanghai currency, and still stable against the French franc. The exchange rate between American and British currencies also did not fluctuate, rose 0.15 against Shanghai currency, and still lacked changes against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the opening of the bank's spot selling prices in the morning, the British exchange rate was 6 pence 0.0075, and the American exchange rate was 13.1875 yuan, which was the same as the end of last week. After the opening, because Japanese commercial banks were quite willing to sell and competed fiercely, coupled with the strong selling sentiment of various Chinese commercial banks, the market situation loosened. It is estimated that Chinese banks and Japanese banks successively sold spot British gold at 6 pence 0.0078125 and 0.008125 to HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, they did not change, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be 0.01 higher, calculated at 2.75%. At that time, Chinese banks' selling interest was still strong, and they competed with the Indian Bank Corporation to sell spot American exchange at 13.25 yuan and 13.12125 yuan to a certain bank of Chase, so the situation was still loose. After this, foreign firms came to support slightly, and the sellers' willingness to supply gradually decreased, so the market situation stabilized. It is estimated that foreign firms bought spot British gold at 6 pence 0.0078125 from HSBC and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, and also bought spot American exchange at 13.25 yuan from a certain bank. Near noon, the transaction of British and American exchange became rare, and there was only buying and selling of Hong Kong dollar exchange. It is estimated that the Guangdong Power of Chinese banks sold spot prices to Chinese speculators at 45.625 yuan, and the situation was quite firm. At the close of noon, the bank's spot selling prices were 6 pence 0.0078125 for British exchange and 13.25 yuan for American exchange.</p>
<p>British, American, and Hong Kong Exchange Rates All Saw Increases</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a certain bank of Chase first sold spot British gold at 6 pence 0.008125 to Standard Chartered. Subsequently, China South Bank and Overseas Chinese Bank of Chinese banks successively sold spot American exchange at 13.3125 yuan to foreign firms. Later, foreign firms bought spot British gold at 6 pence 0.0075 from HSBC Standard Chartered, and also bought spot American exchange at 13.25 yuan from a certain bank, so the process was quite stable. After entering the market, the Dutch foreign firm sold spot Hong Kong exchange at 45.5 yuan to a foreign firm, and the situation softened slightly. Extended to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 6 pence 0.0078125 for British gold and 13.25 yuan for American exchange, the same as the noon closing. As a result, compared with the end of last week, the British exchange rate rose by 0.0003125, the American exchange rate hardened by 0.000625, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was also 0.0025 cheaper after being rolled over at the transaction price.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Loosens, Gold Price Dips Slightly, Daily Fluctuations Exceed 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market situation for melted red gold: the rise and fall were sudden and uncertain, entirely dependent on the transfer of buying and selling between the two sides. At the beginning of the opening, due to the remaining trend from the previous day, the market situation was quite firm. The opening price immediately reached 2570 yuan. Although money exchange dealers frequently came to throw and block for retail investors after the opening, because the silver house gang and a certain bank still had strong absorption power, the price still struggled at 2566 and 2567 yuan. After 11:00, a certain cash bank suddenly developed a selling trend, and the internal market of foreign exchange was gradually hardening. In addition, buyers were all watching with their hands in their sleeves, so the price could not support the decline. The noon closing price fell to a low of 2515 yuan, but the transaction volume was only 30 taels when it fell. Later, because the buyers took the opportunity to come and buy at a low price, it rose slightly, but as a result, it finally fell by 20 yuan compared to the end of last week due to the loose and hard foreign exchange. The transaction was slightly clearer, about 600 taels throughout the day. The silver ornament gold also rose first and then fell, and as a result, it was slightly smaller by 1 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable as before.</p>
<p>Melted Red Falls Slightly</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially stable. First, a certain gold shop absorbed 50 taels from the money exchange industry for speculators, and the price was 2570 yuan for the opening quotation, which was 20 yuan higher than the noon closing price at the end of last week. Soon, a certain gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain bank, and the price was 2568 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange industry also sold 30 taels to the silver house gang, and the price was the same. Later, the money exchange industry mutually traded 10 taels, and the price was 2565 yuan. Before long, a certain silver house mutually traded 50 taels, and the price was 2567 yuan. Around 11:00, the money exchange industry actually gave 30 taels to a certain bank, and the money exchange industry mutually traded 50 taels. The prices were all 2566 yuan. After that, a certain cash bank suddenly started selling, and at the same time, the foreign exchange market loosened, so many buyers watched with their hands in their sleeves. Half an hour later, the price suddenly hardened by 51 yuan. A certain cash bank sold 30 taels to the silver house gang, and 2515 yuan was the noon closing price. After the closing, the buyers all wanted to take the opportunity to absorb at a low price, but the sellers had no intention to supply, so no transaction was made, but the price had risen back to around 2530 yuan. At 2:00 p.m., the money exchange industry mutually traded 30 taels, and the price was 2530 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange industry entered a certain gold shop with 50 taels, and the price was 2532 yuan. Soon, a certain gold shop spent 50 taels on the same industry, and the price was 2530 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange industry came to absorb again, and the gold shop stopped selling, so the potential was upward. In an instant, it jumped up 8 yuan. A certain money exchange industry entered the silver house gang with 50 taels, and the price was 2538 yuan. Then, it entered the same industry with 10 taels, and the price was 2540 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop's intention to sell resurfaced, taking advantage of the high price to sell relentlessly, so it turned downward immediately. A certain gold shop sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry, and the price was 2537 yuan. In an instant, it fell by another 7 yuan. At 3:00, a certain gold shop sold 10 taels to the money exchange industry, and 2530 yuan was the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 20 yuan compared with the noon closing price on Saturday of last week. The difference throughout the day was 55 yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold was about 10 yuan higher than the melted red gold. The spot gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were very few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Rises First and Then Falls</p>
<p>The exchange of gold per tael in the silver building's jewelry store did not change at first. Until 10:14, because the morning opening of melted red was quite firm, it also listed 2 yuan higher. Later, at 12:00 noon, because the market situation of melted red was tilting and tired, it returned 3 yuan smaller. After that, there was no change. As a result, it was reduced by 1 yuan. It is estimated that Datonghang changed to suspend 257 yuan, Xintonghang was 255 yuan, and the income was 249 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The China Cash Buying Price of the Central Bank remains stable at 1212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed customs gold has not changed, and it is estimated to be 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 6 li. The Shanghai standard spot gold price has also not changed, and it is still 1207 yuan and 6 jiao, which is due to the London telegram on the 24th, and the British pure gold is still 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Rises Again, Opens High at 110 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rediscount rate for exchange-drawn bills rose suddenly again, breaking through 100 yuan. In the morning, it was always around 100 yuan per thousand yuan. In the afternoon, it rose again to 110 yuan, which was 20 yuan higher than last week. The interbank lending rate remained stable, with 2 jiao and 5 fen listed in both the morning and afternoon.</p>
<h3>Korean Tickets Are Scarce, Jump Up by 5.5 Fen Alone</h3>
<p>Last Saturday, the British pure gold and the exchange rate of the US dollar continued to remain unchanged. Yesterday, the foreign exchange of the Japanese port, foreign firms settled their payments quite vigorously, foreign banks' supply was smooth, and Western merchants and Japanese banks' supply and sales were very diligent. The market situation was loose. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6 fen 0.0078125, which was 0.00063125 looser than Saturday, and the US dollar exchange rate was 13 yuan 0.25 jiao, which was also 0.000625 looser. Melted red opened, and the gold shop's buying interest was strong. After the price was raised by 20 yuan compared with last Saturday, it was heard that the remittance draft was loose, and the supply of money exchange customers was smooth, and the market situation was weak. The noon closing price of 2515 yuan was the lowest price. In the afternoon, customers took the opportunity to absorb at a low price, and the market situation was slightly firm, but the transaction was sparse, and the change was very narrow. The evening closing price was 2530 yuan. As a result, the foreign currency British and American gold pounds, which fell by 20 yuan compared with last Saturday, were still in strong demand. The market price of the British and American gold pounds rose due to the loose remittance draft, and all of them tended to decline. The demand for French franc tickets and Singapore tickets was rare, and most of them declined. The supply of Japanese gold tickets was not smooth, and the market situation was still firm. The evening market was 0.995 yuan. Korean tickets were out of stock, and the market price rose sharply. The evening market was 0.915 yuan, which was 0.055 yuan higher than last Saturday. There were few transactions in the association, and only Hou Jichu Town and Jinmei sold 100 yuan of gold tickets. Yesterday, the gold pound fell by 0.2 yuan, the British gold ticket fell by 0.3 yuan, the US gold pound rose by 0.5 yuan, the US gold ticket fell by 0.12 yuan, the French franc ticket fell by 0.02 yuan, the Singapore ticket fell by 0.02 yuan, the Philippine ticket fell by 0.05 yuan, the German gold ticket fell by 0.1 yuan, and other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Securities Government Bond Market</h3>
<p>Opens on July 4 After Bank Closes Accounts</p>
<p>The government bond unofficial market, previously discussed to be suspended for two days, should have opened normally yesterday. However, at that time, there were still various difficulties. The settlement procedures of various companies were restricted due to the bank's revision of new methods. Accounts such as pledges and overdrafts were suddenly restricted, resulting in dishonored checks. This caused disputes, which were still being straightened out. Therefore, all the peers decided to temporarily suspend the market for the sake of maintaining the interests of the peers and waiting for the official announcement of the supplementary measures of the banking industry. It was approved to open normally from July 4 (that is, the first day of opening after the bank closed its accounts).</p>
<p>Because of frequent settlements, the stock prices of public places of many industries have not changed. Although Yihuo shares closed at a buying price of 18.6 yuan, there was a transaction at 18.9 yuan in the morning. The rubber stock market seemed to have little interest, but many buyers offered prices slightly higher than the previous days.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton The Cantonese Purchasers of Spot Yarn Are Uniquely Strong, The Trading of Peers Is Greatly Reduced, The Market Price Has Fallen Back Three to Four Yuan</h3>
<p>The unofficial market trading of cotton yarn spot goods is proceeding as usual, and the Cantonese purchasing agents are becoming increasingly strong. These goods are all shipped to Guangzhou Bay and transported to the mainland for sale. The market price is supported by this actual transaction, and the yarn price is stable. The trading of peers is greatly reduced, because banks and money houses cannot overdraft, and cannot be used as collateral for raising funds, and the capital is tight, which makes it difficult to turn around. Therefore, the range of fluctuations is small. In the afternoon, it rained continuously, and the number of people gathered was small, and the business became clearer, but the market price was not flexible and fell by two or three yuan due to the lack of demand. It is estimated that the Cantonese and the peers traded more than 1,000 bales, and the market price fell by three or four yuan compared with the weekend price. In addition, 14 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai today.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market used to be crowded with Japanese people, and the heat was soaring, but now it has been greatly reduced, probably because the continuous mildew rain has dispersed it. It is said that the unofficial price of 20 counts of Yueqin yarn for this month is 400 yuan to 395 yuan, and there was no opening trade in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Yarn Prices Before and After Market Suspension</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Trading Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>The Industry Is Discussing the Payment Problem, More Than 25,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton Have Arrived</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market price: At the beginning of the opening of the New York cotton market, because the Bombay telegram reported a drop, the spot price in the South also fell, and because of the weekend, many parties profited and closed their positions, so it fell by 3-5 pounds. Later, although it recovered slightly due to good telegrams from Liverpool, the closing price still fell by 1-3 pounds. India predicted a drop of 1 rupee, and Egypt stopped trading.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trading has become stagnant since the government issued an order to restrict withdrawals. Because of the difficulty in exchanging legal tender, and the recent arrival of foreign cotton is crowded, some factories have ordered foreign countries to stop loading, and some have settled with the sellers. The Cotton Industry Association had previously discussed the issue of goods and funds, and convened a meeting. The Yarn Factory Federation also convened a meeting a few days ago, because there are several points that need to be carefully considered. It is scheduled to hold another meeting at the Yong'an Company at noon today. The foreign cotton companies in Shanghai have also been invited to participate, so the future cotton funds and other issues of each factory will be discussed and settled today. The market transaction has been quiet in recent days. After the financial sector has a good strategy, it is possible to restore it.</p>
<p>The Samtia, managed by the British Company, transported 3,900 tons of Indian cotton from Calcutta, about 15,000 pieces, and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (25th), and is being unloaded at the Qichang Stack in Pudong. In addition, the Rahore, managed by the company, shipped 2,707 tons of cotton from Mumbai, and 10,000 pieces are expected to arrive in port the day after tomorrow (29th).</p>
<p>Local cotton trading is still extinct, and there are no transactions in various factories. In fact, the goods are short, and all sources have been interrupted long ago. The business is as rare as phoenix feathers. As for the trading of foreign cotton between peers, it has also decreased due to the difficulty of the payment issue. Yesterday, only one transaction was made among the peers: 600 pieces of American cotton Pengjiapu, and the price was 96 yuan in banknotes and delivered to the stack. Although the sources in northern Jiangsu are declining, sporadic arrivals are still uninterrupted. 677 bales of Tongzhou flower arrived at the wharf.</p>
<h3>Grain Flour Sales Are Calm Wheat Price Falls by Five Fen</h3>
<p>Flour The spot flour market yesterday was as dull as ever. Although it was the beginning of the week, sales were still calm, probably because the financial problems have not been properly resolved. The exchange rediscount rate is still high, and it is difficult for customers who sell exchange to approach for transactions for a while, so both the north and south gangs have reported stagnation, and only the daily retail transactions of this street are available. The second-grade flour is sold at 4.65 yuan in cash. The future of the market may be difficult to develop for a while. Today, 2,000 bags of flour are shipped to Weihaiwei.</p>
<p>Wheat The new wheat sources of the day before yesterday were also dull due to the financial stagnation, and there were not many arrivals. The intake of each flour mill was also dull and unfulfilled, and only the shops in this street occasionally asked. Therefore, some holders, in order to sell goods for cash, seemed to be more accommodating than before. It is said that a new batch of Kunshan wheat was opened, with an estimated amount of more than 400 bags, and the price was 6.65 yuan, which was 0.05 yuan smaller than the market on the weekend.</p>
<h3>Saigonese Rice Recently Fixed at 300 Tons Japonica Rice Sales Are Active in the Store</h3>
<p>Du Japonica The sources of each gang, Hexia did not arrive, and 2,000 bags of wheel buns arrived. The weather was cloudy and rainy, and people's hearts were firm. The shop appetite in this street was quite active. However, all of them chose cheap goods, so the market for thick and thin Japonica rice in the lower section was suddenly seen to be lively, and the situation was very tight. However, the high-quality goods had limited access, and the market situation was normal, so as a result, those in the lower section of thick and thin Japonica rice rose by one or two jiao, and the high-quality goods kept the original disk and hit the yuan and were flat.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice The spot goods on the market are scarce. Currently, Saigon is still calling for 23 yuan yesterday, and there are only dozens of sentences of zero distribution. However, according to the definite news from grain merchants, a new batch was newly fixed yesterday, and the number was not large. It is estimated that there are only two or three hundred tons, if the Shanghai market rises again and can be transported, there may be a continued order, and the price is 21 yuan, which is the number one Saigon, which will arrive in Shanghai in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Customer Xian Yesterday's fixed situation, except for Jingwu's special high-quality Xian, which is still 5-6 jiao short of the limited price and has not yet been sampled, the ordinary high-quality goods are all sold at the limited price. However, Bomi has mainland gangs装, the high-quality Bomi is lifted by 1-2 jiao, and the supply and demand of Duyangjian Bujian are equal, and there is no prosperity or disgrace.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake Raw Soybean Oil No Significant Changes</h3>
<p>Since the soybean oil market was restricted from withdrawing cash deposits, there have been no transactions for five days. Until yesterday, the people's hearts in various industries gradually returned to normal. The oil market was in a difficult situation, and the paper had to be traded. The market situation has not changed much from before the Dragon Boat Festival, but the transactions are still in cash, and the date of payment of the goods is stated and determined by both parties. It is very unusual and will not be handled in accordance with industry rules for the time being. The total market is estimated to have opened 400 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil, the price is 34 yuan, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, the price is 33 yuan, 200 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, the price is 34.4 yuan to 34 yuan, 200 pieces of Tianjin canned soybean oil, the price is 45.3 yuan and 45 yuan, 30 barrels of Kobe Lian soybean oil, the price is 47.7 yuan, and the destinations are 200 pieces of raw oil for the Hong Kong gang, and the rest are mostly the sales in the gardens and workshops of this street.</p>
<p>As for the soybean oil coming to Shanghai, 1,150 pieces came from Qingdao yesterday, and 350 cans of sesame oil also came from Qingdao. In addition, 29,409 pieces of soybean cake were also transported.</p>
<p>In addition, there are 1,477 bags of soybeans, which were loaded from Tianjin yesterday, and 200 bags were loaded today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sliced Qing Rises by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market: According to foreign telegrams, there were slight ups and downs. The recent Netherlands was loose and the distant term rose. July was 8.30 Dutch guilders, and September and October were 8.55 Dutch guilders. The recent London rose slightly. August was 7 shillings 4.25 pence, and December and March of next year remained unchanged. The spot price of the local association's market was slightly lower by 1 jiao, which was 28.9 yuan for the standard stack of rough white, 28.7 yuan for the foreign stack, and 0.05 yuan higher for the bonded cargo for transshipment, with 20.5 yuan half, and 200 bags were traded. Taigu Chebai rose by 1 jiao, West stack B mark was 28.7 yuan, CW mark was 28.4 yuan, CX mark was 28.1 yuan, DY mark was 27.6 yuan, HX mark was 27.4 yuan, H mark Chechi was 18.6 yuan, the spot price of Dutch Red was 20 yuan, the transshipment cargo was 14 yuan, and the standard white and No. 1 ice did not rise or fall. Guotang had a Cantonese gang opening more than 350 bags of sliced Qing, the higher price was 12 yuan, the next was 11.8 yuan, which was about one yuan higher than before, and 110 bags of Nanjiang Qing were 17 yuan. Yesterday, 1,966 bags of sugar were transported from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Longans are expected to rise</h3>
<p>Guai longan Because there are few continued arrivals recently, and the stock on the market is also lacking, and the current cash is high, the market situation suddenly tends to be tight, and the number of squares is called to rise by 2-3 yuan, plus the temporary water is still difficult to combine,</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Cotton Fabric Market Cannot Move, Dishonored Check Disputes Have Not Been Resolved, and Orders Cannot Be Processed As Scheduled</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton fabric market still could not move due to the high rediscount rate. The dishonored check disputes among peers have not been resolved. Many parties feel depressed due to the inflexibility of turnover, resulting in the failure to handle the due orders as scheduled. The situation of the manufacturers is difficult, and people are uneasy. There is a sense that the mountains and rain are coming, and the wind is filling the building. However, the trading with local customers still has some embellishments, but the sales disk is relaxed. The price of white goods, groups of cloth, and fine cloth has decreased by 0.05-0.1 yuan per piece. The cash price of Yihuo groups of cloth is as follows: 16 pounds Shuangxiang 15.90 14 pounds Yilu 14.90 14 pounds Sanlu 14.90 13 pounds Jiutian 13.90 11 pounds Santu 12.85 9 pounds Five Width 10.80</p>
<p>The Cantonese and Yunnan helpers had good intentions for customer sales. They bought more than 100 packages of fine cloth such as Fugui brand, and more than 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored diagonal, flower serge, pongee, and satin. The Wen and Tai gangs handled dozens of packages of scattered colored goods, and the main street handled more than 30 pieces of coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece</p>
<p>The white goods still have no market, but there is a small amount of unofficial trading of Longtou fine cloth, only a dozen or twenty packages. The price per piece is 14.3 yuan in cash. It is heard that foreign firms will use remittance to pay for the due goods of the factory at the market premium, so that they can be handed over. However, how to settle the buying and selling between peers has not yet been specifically resolved.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>Today, ten pieces of piece goods were exported to Weihaiwei, thirty-seven pieces were transported to Yantai, and eleven pieces</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Chekiang Silk Is Still Being Traded</h3>
<p>Overseas silk market: New York was closed on Sunday, and the Yokohama silk price turned upward, with the spot price opening at 1160 yuan in the morning, rising 15 yuan, and the long-term price at 1095 yuan, rising 11 yuan. The closing price in the afternoon was 1173 yuan, with an additional increase of 13 yuan, and the long-term price was 1109 yuan, with an increase of 14 yuan. Therefore, overseas silk prices are expected to improve this week.</p>
<p>Because the cocoon transport was blocked, the local silk market was not very active. There has been little clear atmosphere in the past two decades. Yesterday, foreign firms slightly absorbed and purchased, and the silk price was easy to approach both internally and externally due to the exchange rate relationship. However, there are not many old goods, and the new cocoons have not yet arrived. In this period of non-convergence of new and old goods, there are many hidden worries for the future, and transactions are naturally difficult to be smooth. It is estimated that the British and French factories entered the Chekiang factory with 50 dan of Chekiang, and the Yin Zhuang entered 10 dan of Chekiang in the lower stem. The silk prices are all considered good. However, because the rising wind of the white factory is too high, yesterday's market price is not as attractive as the Chekiang warp. It is said that the silver fish grade of Chekiang warp was sold at 1300 yuan, which is truly worthy of being called a record of a consistent period. On the 24th, 454 pieces of Huzhou silk and 52 pieces of silk head were transported to Europe.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Exports are Still Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the edge tea was still lively. The British and French estates searched for purchases because the demand from overseas was urgent. Xiehe Tianyu and other firms all had a large amount of intake. A total of 590 boxes of ordinary Zhenmei were traded throughout the city. The price of Chou Xin Lingmei was 290 yuan to 315 yuan, and the price of ordinary Zhenmei was 245 yuan to 278 yuan. The price was the same as last week. Recently, the sources in Hangzhou and Huzhou have been very thin, so people's hearts are stable. On the 24th, 2488 boxes of tea were transported to Europe.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports of Hogs' Bristles and Casings Destined for Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, goods arriving in Shanghai included 1,000 bags of Huangshi powder shipped from Hong Kong, and 1,300 tins of tung oil and 40 pieces of woolen fabrics from Tianjin. Furthermore, export goods from the previous day (the 24th) included 5 packages of hog bristles, 35 packages of hog casings, and 28 packages of egg yolk and white, all destined for Europe.</p>
<h3>Metals: Zinc Sheets Soar in Price, but Severely Affected by Export Restrictions</h3>
<p>Zinc sheet trading has suffered a major blow in sales since customs imposed export restrictions. Most transactions in North China are also sporadic. The only outlet is the local Shanghai market. Before the sharp fall in foreign exchange rates, there was still demand from tea firms, printing houses, battery factories, cigarette factories, etc. However, recently, due to the sudden increase in costs, selling prices have risen accordingly. For example, grade 2 colored sheets are sold at 320 yuan per barrel, grades 3 and 4 at 310 yuan, grade 5 at 305 yuan, grade 6 at 290 yuan, grade 7 at 285 yuan, grades 8 at 280 yuan, grades 9 and 10 at 295 yuan. Thick colored sheets, such as grades 11 to 16, are priced at over 300 yuan per barrel, an increase of 60 to 100+ yuan compared to previous market prices. However, buyers are mostly standing by and watching due to the rapid price increase, leading to extreme stagnation in sales. After the Ministry of Finance restricted withdrawals, the market has become even more sluggish.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Tea Management Methods</h3>
<p>— Feng Hefa</p>
<p>Last year, the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to handle the unified purchase and sale of tea leaves nationwide, establishing the initial foundation for wartime agricultural policy. This year, to fundamentally transform the production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales of tea leaves, the Ministry of Finance, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, promulgated the General Rules for the Organization of Tea Industry Management Agencies in Various Provinces. This was to establish connections between the tea industry management agencies established in each province and the Trade Commission to further advance the industry. In March of this year, Zhejiang Province established the Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office. This was done in cooperation with the Department of Construction and various central government agencies, with differences in the content of each department. The tea leaf department entered into a loan and tea purchase agreement with the Trade Commission, tasking the Management Office's tea leaf department with handling the improvement of production, manufacturing, and transportation. The Director of the Office is Wu, Director of the Construction Department, who concurrently holds the position, while Mr. Fei Hongnian and Mr. Liu Baochen serve as Deputy Directors. I have been entrusted with presiding over the affairs of the tea leaf department. Because the unified purchase and sale of tea leaves has been the most effective special product since the start of the War of Resistance, Mr. Zou Bingwen and Mr. Wu Juenong of the Trade Commission have long had detailed plans for the entire transformation of the tea industry and its coordination with the War of Resistance. The management of the Zhejiang tea industry follows established policies, taking into consideration the local special circumstances and gradually promoting them. The general situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Four Major Goals</p>
<p>Wartime tea industry policy has four goals: First, to acquire materials as part of mobilizing material resources. The purpose is to avoid personal use and to concentrate the scattered forces previously controlled by private individuals. Second, to strengthen finance by earning foreign exchange, which is the concrete content of acquiring materials. This requires the government to centrally plan transportation and sales, and increase exports to achieve success. Third, to stabilize rural areas and increase tea leaf production, thereby enriching the farmers' economy, balancing the interests of all levels, and improving the organization of tea farmers. This is not only required by wartime economic policy but is also a method to promote the organization of the masses. Fourth, to fundamentally transform the entire tea leaf production system to contribute to the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. In peacetime, countless man-made difficulties hinder the improvement of the tea industry. However, during this war, some of the social ills disappear with the fighting, creating an opportunity for the tea industry's participation in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>(2) Four Steps</p>
<p>The advancement of wartime tea industry policy follows the production steps, divided into the following four stages: First, improve production and benefit farmers. Currently, tea farmers' planting of tea trees and the selection and production of crude tea are extremely scattered and rudimentary, lacking technical knowledge. While this seems to be the main cause, it is actually because the mountain price lacks guarantees, profits are difficult to obtain, and hunger and cold are a constant worry, making it difficult to expand production and improve technology. Therefore, the key issue is how to maintain good prices for crude tea and prevent exploitation. Second, improve tea factories and upgrade manufacturing: The tea factories in various regions today are not only rudimentary but also mostly close to speculation, producing intermittently with no long-term plans. This is because the transportation and sales system is not reasonable and the market lacks guarantees. The tea factories suffer from the intermediate merchants, who pass the burden on to the tea farmers, leading to a cycle of exploitation that inevitably ends in mutual destruction. Third, reduce intermediaries and abolish corrupt practices: The original comprador-like consignment tea firms collude with foreign companies to suppress tea factories, imposing numerous corrupt practices. The decline of the tea industry is truly due to these practices. Fourth, direct trade and increase exports: This is a persistent problem for commercial agricultural products. Without sales and markets, it is pointless to talk about tea industry improvement. However, if direct trade cannot be achieved and control remains with foreign companies and intermediaries, there is no way to expand the market.</p>
<p>(3) Management Principles</p>
<p>The work of the tea leaf department is solely to accomplish the goals set by the wartime tea industry policy and to implement the above-mentioned work. However, since it is an organization that cooperates with local and central governments, its nature may raise questions. Therefore, I will simply explain our work policy: First, to promote the central government's unified purchase and sale policy, as this is the foundation of tea industry policy. Without unified purchase and sale, there is no way to talk about the purpose of "acquiring materials and strengthening finance," nor is there any way to achieve the work of "reducing intermediaries, abolishing corrupt practices," and "direct trade and increasing exports." Second, to safeguard the interests of farmers and merchants in the province. Only by increasing the interests of farmers and merchants can we foster their love for the tea industry and, in turn, increase their faith in the nation and the people. The foundation of the so-called "stabilizing rural areas and improving the tea industry" also lies in this. The way to safeguard these interests is definitely not through blind promotion, but rather through adjusting the distribution of benefits between all levels of production. Only then can we talk about "improving production and benefiting farmers, improving tea factories and upgrading manufacturing." Third, to serve the improvement of the province's tea industry as much as possible. As we know, management and administration should not only impose passive restrictions on the people but should also actively promote and assist them. Although the tea leaf department itself does not directly or indirectly bear the responsibility of business operations (such as purchasing), nor does it collect any fees, it should, upon the entrustment of the central unified purchase and sale agency and based on the needs of farmers and merchants in the province, handle various matters related to tea industry improvement with a service-oriented attitude, without confining itself to the passive work of an administrative agency.</p>
<p>(4) Several Tasks</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned goals, the work content of the tea leaf department is extremely complex. At the beginning of this year, preparations were hasty, making it difficult to implement everything. However, the following aspects will be promoted in order, striving to achieve something:</p>
<p>(1) Promoting Tea Farmer Production - This not only refers to the production and manufacturing of crude tea. On the one hand, the goal of tea industry policy is to realize large-scale, modern tea factories; on the other hand, it seeks to simplify and rationalize production relations. Before developing national capital to modernize all tea factories, it is urgent to promote the refined production of boxed tea by tea farmers to increase their benefits. The method is to promote cooperative organizations. The Ministry of Finance's General Rules for the Organization of Tea Industry Management Agencies in Various Provinces lists tea farmer cooperation as a major part of the work. The province has a cooperative work team responsible for this task, so the tea leaf department only needs to maintain close contact with it and promote it together to achieve success.</p>
<p>(2) Balancing Tea Leaf Prices - This is the core of the tea industry improvement problem. On the one hand, it involves guaranteeing reasonable profits for tea merchants; on the other hand, it involves increasing the benefits for tea farmers. The former is easier to achieve, and the method is to sign an agreement with the Trade Commission to guarantee tea prices, organize an evaluation committee, and fairly negotiate to ensure that tea factories obtain legitimate profits. The latter is the most important task, but it is more difficult to achieve due to the scattered nature of tea farmers. This year's plan is to first determine the highest, lowest, and average pull prices for crude tea, and order merchants to purchase it with cash. To prevent price suppression and monopoly, the tea leaf department, in consultation with the central Trade Commission, will establish crude tea purchasing offices in various tea regions, purchasing tea at the prescribed prices. If merchants are willing to offer higher prices in competition, they will be allowed to do so naturally. In this way, the interests of farmers can be increased, and the problems that previously could not be solved due to passive restrictions can be easily resolved.</p>
<p>(3) Regulating Tea Industry Finance - If farmers want to improve production and tea merchants want to improve manufacturing, they must first have sufficient capital and be able to use it freely. At this time of war, when financial turnover is more difficult, farmers and merchants will have problems raising funds themselves. The tea leaf department has specially borrowed tea loan funds from the Purchasing Committee to lend at low interest rates. This year's estimate is that it will be over three million. In terms of tea material supplies, to avoid merchants' difficulties in purchasing and high costs, it is also planned to purchase in bulk at the statutory exchange rate as a form of in-kind lending.</p>
<p>(4) Improving Tea Factory Equipment - To improve the organization of tea factories and crack down on speculation, tea factory registration will be held before the tea season, stipulating the necessary capital and equipment, etc. After opening, factory managers will be assigned to supervise and guide the factories to improve equipment and upgrade production. The factories will also receive the Trade Commission's opinions on the various types and grades of tea needed in overseas markets for reference and compliance to achieve the purpose of appropriate supply and demand and planned production.</p>
<p>(5) Adjusting Warehouse and Transportation Organization - During wartime, warehouse and transportation are major problems for the tea industry. On the positive side, the goal is to achieve fast transportation, low transportation costs, high transportation volumes, and safe warehousing. On the negative side, the goal is to crack down on smuggling and tax evasion. Special tea warehouse and transportation stations will be established in key locations, and tea warehouse and transportation businesses will be registered for centralized management.</p>
<p>(6) Developing Research and Training - There is much to be researched in all aspects of tea industry transformation. The tea leaf department will proceed with these matters to the best of its ability. However, the promotion of tea administration depends on talent, so attention must be paid to improving the training and cultivation of capable cadres. These individuals must not only possess sufficient academic knowledge of tea leaf production and manufacturing technology but also have a full understanding of the entire tea industry policy, be selfless, and work hard. In this way, the transformation of China's tea industry can be hoped for.</p>
<p>(5) Organizational Overview</p>
<p>The tea leaf department has three sections responsible for guidance, finance, and warehousing. There are already nearly 120 employees, 50 resident factory managers, 30 warehouse and transportation station personnel, and 20 personnel responsible for loan matters in various districts. The number of personnel in the headquarters and various offices is quite small. Most of the technical personnel are transferred and borrowed from various agencies in Zhejiang Province. Those with more than five or six people engaged in common work are recruited through examinations. Staff members such as resident factory managers are given a considerable period of training before being assigned. Internal work is divided among the various departments of this office. All matters related to tea leaf improvement are coordinated with other relevant agencies. A detailed work plan report is available separately. Regarding tea administration theory, a "Discussion on Wartime Tea Industry Policy" has been drafted to seek advice from experts.</p>

<h3>On Chinese Medical Art (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>Philosophical Aspects</p>
<p>Now, let us set aside art for a moment and speak of the foundations or sources of the treatment principles of Chinese medicine. For any academic discipline, speech must precede action, and philosophy must precede speech. Perhaps you suspect that I am not afraid of a headache here, speaking of the abstruse philosophy of Chinese medicine. Do not be afraid, philosophy can be arcane and fabricated, or it can be derived from experimentation. Arcane philosophy is, of course, frightening, so let us not mention it. Philosophy derived from experimentation, on the other hand, is very valuable.</p>
<p>People say that the philosophy of Chinese medicine is based solely on Yin-Yang and the Five Elements. However, Yin-Yang and the Five Elements are two distinct things. The emergence of their doctrines occurred with Yin-Yang first and the Five Elements later; one appears in the Book of Changes, and the other appears in the Book of Documents. The Five Elements theory in the Hong Fan chapter of the Book of Documents, regardless of whether we use the textual criticism of scholars to distinguish its authenticity, we can believe that it was indeed presented by Ji Zi, and it fell after the Yin-Yang of the Book of Changes. The Book of Changes only has Yin-Yang and not the Five Elements. Therefore, the Five Elements is a later theory, which was only heavily used by the alchemists of the Qin and Han dynasties and permeated into all Chinese academics, causing smoke and haze, not only in medicine. In reality, whether it occurred before or after the emergence of the Five Elements theory, there was still a concept of numbers. This concept dominated politics, education, and the hearts of the people and was more practical. It is not like the Five Elements theory, which is ridiculously unsuitable for everything, that is, unsuitable for anything. It would take too long to explain, so let us list its examples here.</p>
<p>Cosmology: Six Directions (Six Dimensions) - Up, Down, Four Directions</p>
<p>Political Sphere: Six Officials - Heaven, Earth, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter Also, Six Ministries - Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, Metal, Grain</p>
<p>Military: Six Armies</p>
<p>Palace: Six Palaces</p>
<p>Academics: Six Schools - Confucianism, Mohism, Logicians, Legalists, Yin-Yang, Taoism</p>
<p>Also, Six Arts - Ritual, Music, Archery, Horsemanship, Writing, Mathematics</p>
<p>Also, Six Classics - Book of Changes, Book of Poetry, Book of Documents, Book of Music, Book of Rites, Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<p>I Ching: Six Lines - Initial, One, Three, Four, Five, Six</p>
<p>Poetry: Six Principles - Fu (Narration), Bi (Metaphor), Xing (Allegory), Feng (Folk Songs), Ya (Court Songs), Song (Hymns)</p>
<p>Ritual: Six Rites - Capping, Marriage, Funeral, Sacrifice, Archery, Military</p>
<p>Music: Six Pitch-Pipes</p>
<p>Also, Six Scales</p>
<p>Writing: Six Scripts - Pictographic, Ideographic, Associative Compounds, Phono-Semantic Compounds, Mutually Explanatory Characters, Loan Characters</p>
<p>Painting: Six Canons</p>
<p>Agriculture: Six Grains - Rice, Foxtail Millet, Soybeans, Wheat, Broomcorn Millet, Proso Millet</p>
<p>Kinship: Six Relations - Father's Lineage (Three Generations), Mother's Lineage (Three Generations) Animal Husbandry: Six Domestic Animals - Horse, Cow, Sheep, Chicken, Dog, Pig Medicine: Six Viscera - Stomach, Small Intestine, Large Intestine, Gallbladder, Bladder Also, Six Officials - Eyes, Ears, Mouth, Nose, Anterior Yin, Posterior Yin</p>
<p>Also, Six Causes - Qi, Blood, Phlegm, Food, Worms, Accumulation Also, Six Climatic Factors - Wind, Cold, Summer Heat, Dampness, Dryness, Fire</p>
<p>Also, Six Syndromes - Exterior, Interior, Deficiency, Excess, Cold, Heat</p>
<p>Also, Six Channels - Yangming, Taiyang, Shaoyang, Jueyin, Taiyin, Shaoyin</p>
<p>Also, Six Therapeutic Methods - Sweating, Vomiting, Purging, Warming, Clearing, Tonifying</p>
<p>Also, Six Pulses - Cun, Guan, Chi (Left and Right)</p>
<p>The above-mentioned concept of the number six, prevalent in the universe, human affairs, and all politics, education, and academics, is real and has been practically used during the golden age of the Zhou dynasty. Its origin lies in the three-dimensional concept of the universe in the Six Directions, which is superior to the merely two-dimensional view of the universe in the Five Elements theory. Therefore, the court then adopted this number six to fully prepare for the needs. However, this number six is ultimately not comprehensive, always having the deficiency of being either too much or too little. Therefore, it can only be said to be a coincidental, forced numerical value. On the other hand, the Five Elements theory can generate and overcome, can cycle endlessly, and the principle and number can be used to arbitrarily discuss the state of circulation and then be linked to events. The alchemists then, "finding their place," widely applied it to material aspects and to sound, color, and taste, taking exclusive advantage of it, even applying it to medicine, which concerns human life, to this day. Is that not lamentable?</p>
<p>We know that the concept of the number five is arcane, and the concept of the number six still has the deficiency of being either too much or too little, but it is still more practical in comparison. Therefore, the Confucian-controlled rites, music, punishment, and government used the general idea of the number six to dominate things below the physical form, which is much better than the foreign (?) Five Elements theory.</p>
<p>Returning to the topic, in medicine, physicians are ultimately dealing with practical matters involving life and death. The arcane theories of the Five Elements alone could not dominate it at that time. Therefore, in the phenomena, they勉强凑足 wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, and fire (Zuo Zhuan), applying practical number six to make up for the deficiencies of the Five Elements. Then, they took the Six Fu organs to make up for the deficiencies of the Five Zang organs, resulting in the number eleven, which is too odd! Then, they added the Triple Burner,凑成 twelve numbers, and thus there is the theory of the Twelve Meridians. Alas, the literary circles and writings of that time were not very brilliant. Although the articles were good, some thoughts were not clear. The Twelve Meridians were substantiated by them one by one, and after being substantiated, obstacles arose, making it impossible to communicate widely. Look at the Six Channels of the Treatise on Cold Damage in ancient medical books; contemporary scholars have discovered that they do not match the Twelve Meridians of the Inner Classic, leaving this flaw. Therefore, there is the suspicion that the Treatise on Cold Damage has diseases of the Foot Channels but not of the Hand Channels. Recently, some people have said that the name Six Channels of the Treatise on Cold Damage is a substitute name.</p>
<p>The name Six Channels is clearly a transitional saying from phenomena and numbers. It refers to a broad general designation of a pathological system and is not a major problem. If it must be substantiated one by one with the Zang-Fu organs, obstacles will arise.</p>
<p>The origin of the number of the Six Channels is from the two phenomena of Yin and Yang, plus four small phenomena, which are connected, not arranged vertically. The phenomena are as follows:</p>
<p>Enough, enough abstraction. Never mind it. Neither the Five Elements theory nor the Six Directions theory can be elevated to the modern philosophical platform. Only the theory of Six Qi or Six Evils seems to be sufficient in medicine to become a predisposing factor. That's right, broadly speaking, it's right! Wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, and fire are just as important as food, clothing, housing, and transportation for people living in this atmosphere. No one can deny it. As for why the number of predisposing factors is neither more nor less but exactly six, it is difficult to answer. We can reduce it to four, or add to it to become multiple causes. It's just that the academic world at that time liked to use the full number of six and coincidentally made up this number of six predisposing factors. In general, it can be compared with the earth, air, water, and fire of Pythagoros (B. T. 580) in Western medical history, dry, warm, cold, heat, blood, phlegm, yellow and white bile, and Galen (131)'s animal spirit, nourishing spirit, and natural spirit, the so-called humoral medicine. It also has parallels with the modern theory of endocrinology, which also shows that the experimental philosophy of ancient Chinese medicine is not without basis, not absurd, and has meaning, far better than the Five Elements theory. As for the details, Chinese physicians have continued to elaborate and contribute throughout the historical periods. Because Chinese authors respect the psychology of scriptures and traditions, every contribution follows the example of "the commentary does not break the notes," not engaging in amendments but adding to it, allowing the ancient theories to monopolize the beauty in front, and later history can only shelter the remaining light of the predecessors and illuminate the slow night.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Diseases</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Typhoid Fever</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>What is Typhoid Fever?</p>
<p>The name typhoid fever is borrowed from the old common name. From the Western or new medical point of view, it is really very inconsistent. Because this is an acute febrile disease caused by the infection of a certain type of typhus bacillus in the intestine. It has nothing to do with the harm of cold air. It is better to change it to intestinal fever or intestinal typhus. However, in order to contribute new knowledge to the general ordinary readers, this name is temporarily used as a transition.</p>
<p>Pathogenic bacteria</p>
<p>This disease is a pathological change mainly characterized by fever, splenomegaly, rose rash, intestinal symptoms, and neurological symptoms. The pathogen enters the intestine through the mouth mixed with food. The distant pathogen was discovered by Ebbervan in 1880 and confirmed by Koh and Gaffky. It is a rod-shaped bacterium one to two microns (one thousandth of a hao) long, with flagella at one end, and can carry out active movement. There are four types of A and B paratyphoid bacilli in the same class.</p>
<p>This pathogen dies soon after surviving outside the human body. However, it can survive in the human body for a long time. Therefore, this pathogen can often be found in the human body after illness and can be repeatedly transmitted to others or self-reoccur.</p>
<p>The gallbladder and bone marrow can make this pathogen survive for a long time. The spleen, kidney, and intestines exist in a certain period and are excreted out of the body with urine and feces.</p>
<p>How Typhoid Fever Spreads</p>
<p>When handling raw fish and raw tofu with your hands, your fingers are often infected with this pathogen and accidentally stick to the food and enter the intestine. This is the most dangerous. Flies flying around on food increase the chance of infection.</p>
<p>The internal conditions of the body are closely related to the infection of the disease. A small amount of pathogens can be killed in a healthy stomach. Even if it has invaded the body, it can also be prevented from breeding by the body's defense effect of the blood. Only people with weak gastrointestinal resistance or weak systemic resistance are invaded.</p>
<p>Season for Spreading Typhoid Fever</p>
<p>The epidemic season of typhoid fever is most prevalent between August and September in the solar calendar. Because the outside temperature and the peak breeding season of flies at this time are most suitable for the reproduction and broadcast of pathogens. During floods, wars, etc., when the order of hygiene is disrupted, there are also the most opportunities for transmission. It is more common between the ages of 15 and 25. More men.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Typhoid Fever</p>
<p>After this pathogen invades the human body, it must go through a two- or three-week incubation period before the inherent symptoms appear. The initial symptoms begin with chills and shivering. The situation of shiver is less common. Fever rises early and decreases in the evening, gradually increasing step by step like a ladder. However, there are also cases where it suddenly reaches the highest point and stays still without retreating. The patient complains of headache, insomnia, lack of appetite, dry mouth, thirst, and tongue with dirty coating. Splenomegaly is more common in the first week.</p>
<p>In the second week, rose rash appears on the skin, and the fever remains high without receding. The abdomen is raised, there is rumbling in the ileocecal region, and there is tenderness to the touch.</p>
<p>In the third and fourth weeks, the fever is unpredictable and gradually subsides. The main symptoms throughout the entire process are rose rash, splenomegaly, a lifeless appearance, delirium, slow pulse, bronchitis catarrh, and dry skin. The dangerous complications are cardiac weakness, pneumonia, intestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, beriberi, and hemorrhagic conditions. In addition, there are symptoms such as bedsores, mumps, kidney abscess, and nephritis.</p>
<p>Prognosis of Typhoid Fever</p>
<p>When there are complications such as brain symptoms and cardiac weakness, it is very dangerous. Intestinal bleeding, pneumonia, intestinal perforation, and bedsores are all terrible.</p>
<p>Treatment Knowledge</p>
<h3>Observations on the Treatment of Pneumonia</h3>
<p>— Gu Buwen</p>
<p>Mortality Rate Reduced by 50 Percent After Serum Treatment</p>
<p>There is now a medically interesting matter, that is, the method of treating lobar pneumonia has a new invention path and is progressing forward. However, this is not the spectacle of the so-called "iron lung" when treating breathing difficulties in infantile paralysis, but a truly progressive treatment technique in medicine.</p>
<p>Pneumonia is prevalent in civilized countries around the world and has a great impact on mankind. It is one of the most serious infectious diseases. Taking Manchester, England as an example, in 1937, among the 1,268 cases of pneumonia, as many as 420 people died. Men are infected with this disease twice as often as women. Regardless of age, it is easy to spread and has a special fatal trend. In particular, alcoholics and pregnant women are even more dangerous once they suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>The symptoms of pneumonia suddenly attack, and there is immediately abnormal chest pain, expectoration of thick sputum, and a strong septicemia occurs, and delirium occurs immediately. At the same time, the accumulated secretions in the lungs are secreted excessively, resulting in difficulty breathing. Patients often die due to lack of oxygen, resulting in the decline of their own lung fluid.</p>
<p>In the past, the theory about pneumonia was that the natural trend of pneumonia could not be affected by drugs. Drugs could not reduce its trend, and it was in vain. Now, this theory is congratulating its evidence for not being wrong. Now, after the advent of modern specific blood serum, the mortality rate in pneumonia cases has been greatly reduced, and the prognosis of patients is also mostly good. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Announcement from This Publication</h3>
<p>The manuscript "Comparison of the Pharmacopoeias of the United States, China, Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Japan" co-authored by Mr. Zhou Mengbai and Mr. Zhang Yangzhi is very long in its original version. It is now planned to publish it as a separate book, so this publication will no longer publish it. Readers are asked to forgive us.</p>

<h3>Encouraging Neutral Magazines</h3>
<p>— Shangqing</p>
<p>Currently, Shanghai's magazines can be roughly categorized into three types: one is proactive, unafraid of _, unafraid of danger, and striving to promote the war of resistance; another is passive, only discussing romantic topics, providing people with entertainment after drinking and tea, and perhaps even containing some numbing toxins; and the third type focuses on general social issues, various self-cultivation or _ questions, and introduces some basic scientific knowledge. If it's literary, it publishes aestheticism articles and trivial personal matters, neither touching on major wartime events nor recklessly publishing nonsensical and malicious pieces. This is what I call neutral magazines.</p>
<p>I have no objections to proactive magazines. I only hope they continue to work hard. Unfortunately, there are very few such magazines, and they seem to be dwindling, which worries me, so I hope their numbers will increase. As for passive magazines, it goes without saying that the fewer, the better. It would be best if none were published. Unfortunately, these magazines seem to be the most numerous. We should discuss how to deal with them later. Only neutral magazines, which are also numerous, stand between being proactive and passive. Therefore, I must sincerely encourage them.</p>
<p>The editors of these neutral magazines undoubtedly have their difficulties, which are understandable and even admirable, because they haven't forgotten the responsibility of cultural figures but are constrained by their environment, forcing them to strive on what they consider a proper path. However, I believe they should take slightly bigger steps and make the most of possible opportunities to serve the war of resistance.</p>
<p>We don't necessarily have to attack the enemy in our writings to serve the war of resistance. We can strive to promote our national consciousness and encourage the inherent spirit of resistance in humanity to achieve our goals. Therefore, in terms of subject matter, we can use our history and the revival stories of other nations to subtly convey what we want to say. More specifically, loyal ministers and righteous people from the late Song and Ming dynasties, as well as the rise and fall of Poland and Czechoslovakia, are all excellent materials. Essays, poems, and novels can all be written about them. Similarly, general magazines and literary publications can all engage in this.</p>
<p>Even in general subject matter, we can emphasize military aspects to increase public knowledge of military affairs. Therefore, when discussing science, we can focus on military science, and when discussing economics, we can focus on military economics. I think this would be more meaningful than solely discussing common health knowledge or irrelevant household economics. As for literary descriptions, what's wrong with using the current war as subject matter? Why be confined to personal experiences or laments?</p>
<p>True, doing so might make the magazine articles formulaic and reduce their appeal, making them unpopular with readers. However, I believe that whether articles become formulaic is entirely a matter of technique. If the purpose is clear and various techniques are used to develop it, it won't be formulaic. Otherwise, even if the content is changed a lot, mediocre technique will still lead to formulaic writing. Therefore, whether readers find it interesting and welcome it depends on whether the technique is satisfactory. Moreover, I only said to "emphasize" and "talk more" about these proactive matters, not that the entire magazine should be filled with them. There's still room for discretion. It shouldn't be like some neutral magazines now, which don't mention these matters at all.</p>
<p>I have indeed seen some such neutral magazines, both general and literary, often subsidized by companies or businesses and relying on advertising revenue as their main source of income. Their content can be said to be impeccable because they have no obvious reactionary elements. However, they don't touch on the current situation at all, nor the great struggle for survival that our entire nation is engaged in. If someone said they were deliberately trying to dilute our will to resist, I think they would have nothing to say! Because to express their attitude, they don't need many words; they just need to make the most of possible opportunities to promote resistance! But why are they unwilling to take advantage of this?</p>
<p>I hope these neutral magazines will all take the path of proactivity. As long as you are willing, I believe you can! As long as you can, I guarantee you will develop, because our readers are expecting this! Rise up and strive!</p>
<h3>Yearning for Home by a Sick Person</h3>
<p>— Ding Ti</p>
<p>I fondly remember such a day.</p>
<p>A traveler who has been away from home for many years spends a long period of time in hardship. Broken frost mornings, dusty roads, dawn moon and fading stars, desolate ruins and wild shops, on horseback, at the ferry, in dreams. The family sits around the stove in the round lights, or under the bean trellis, finishing a day's work, that pond, that ancient tree by the village, the small town's monastery, trivial anecdotes of ignorant men and women, the ancestral old house, the lovely atmosphere of the family in the house, you will all remember them. When years of homesickness turn a person into depression, often when you take the first step on the journey home, when you abandon your hometown, strengthen your unyielding faith, and fight hard, after your career is successful, you return to the familiar environment. Perhaps you are sentimental, you shed tears, but you cannot help but have a happy reunion.</p>
<p>You still remember when you went on the expedition, you suppressed your homesickness with your brave hand, covered up the coy childishness, and threw yourself into the embrace of serving the country, embarking on an unfamiliar journey, on the yellow sand plateau, in the overlapping of ten thousand mountains, in the plains where it is mostly cloudy in all seasons, between the torrents of the river and the dangerous rocks, filled with a group of exiles. Coming from afar, everyone has a distant memory. That lost distance makes people melancholy and nostalgic. Separated from the distance, recapture that distance. Capture that smoke, that dream, that old country, that green mountain.</p>
<p>You endure hardship in order to capture it, let the future laughter exchange for the hardships of exile, let homesickness exchange for glorious victory reports. You endure: remembering from afar, capturing that distance, constructing fantasy from isolation. Everyone has their distance, the Hu horse relies on the north wind, the Yue bird faces the southern branches, the people of Jiangnan love fragrant grass, the people of the north love cattle and sheep, watching the evening cooking in poor alleys, some people think of the plank houses during the mosquito thunders, the ape cries in the high mountains and big swamps, some people think of the frog drums between thatched pavilions and ponds.</p>
<p>Not only your own, your distance, you miss the north, you miss the south, you should know, there are also the homes of thousands of people, the homes of friends, the homes of ancestors, the tombs of ancestors of past generations, the fragrant breath of the land. Separation is naturally a dirge, but reunion is even happier.</p>
<p>Like a dream, like a fairy tale, like a rebirth, you knead a piece of homesickness sand into a grain, you shrink the land like Fei Changfang from living as a refugee and returning to be your native, hearing the stories of many innocent people suffering, perfect houses always turning into ashes, slaughter, coercion, ignorance, fraud, creating an unprecedented tragedy in the world, perhaps the unfortunate are your close friends, perhaps the burning of the house has a share of yours, you cannot help but mourn, the blank of your fate, the vicissitudes in the separation. But you are happy after all. Separated from the distance, and then capturing that distance. Separation is sad, but reunion is even more joyful.</p>
<p>Where is your home? Your north, your south. For you to have a greater career, you traveled far away with difficulty, on horseback, at the ferry, in your dreams, you send a piece of homesickness from afar, to the great river, to the returning geese, to the white clouds, to the bright moon.</p>
<p>Capture that distance, the old country, the green mountains will smile for you. Your fragrant grass in Jiangnan, your cattle and sheep in the north.</p>
<h3>Invasion!</h3>
<p>— Dai Cangqi</p>
<h3>Why Must We Believe in Jesus? (2) Because All People Are Like Sheep Gone Astray</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The scripture says: "We all like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all." Today's scripture seems to echo yesterday's scripture: yesterday's scripture said: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." If a person sins and falls short of God's glory without resolving it, without seeking peace with God, he will inevitably have no face to see God, and thus stay away from God, like a sheep going further and further astray; some people are lost in smoking, drinking, and gambling, regardless of losing their family property. Some people are lost in having fun, regardless of wasting time. Some people are lost in beauty, not protecting their personality from falling. Some people are lost in fame and fortune, not satisfied with what they have. Some people go to evil religions, not distinguishing the fake from the real. Once they run into the deep mountains and valleys, they cannot save themselves. At that time, it is truly said: "There is a road to heaven but you don't take it, there is no gate to hell but you break in." It is too late to regret. Look! Today's scripture is a loyal warning to the world to quickly rein in at the edge of the cliff and believe in Christ Jesus as Savior; because the Lord Jesus once announced his mission saying: "I am the good shepherd, the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep." It means that, for the sake of loving the world, he is willing to give his own life to find the lost sheep, until he finds them, carries them back on his shoulders, and the whole family cheers. Jesus said: One sinner repents on earth, and the angels in heaven will also rejoice together. Gentlemen, are you a lost sheep? The Lord Jesus is calling you; little sheep, come back! Little sheep, come back! (To be continued) Shanghai Christian Literary Evangelism Association. P.O. Box 1227.</p>
<h3>Burning Red Chain Snakes (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Mingzhi</p>
<p>——Grandma's Story——</p>
<p>"Many were bitten to death; many were bitten and injured, truly hateful! However, we also killed quite a few of them. We would hit them as soon as we saw them," she continued eloquently, "We would hit these things that were fiery yellow all over. Sometimes there were so many of them that we couldn't hit them all at once, so we would wait a while until they scattered a little before hitting them. After they were killed, we would burn them with wheat husks and straw, burning them without a trace, not even leaving ashes. You know, if you don't burn them like that, their rotten bones are poisonous, and dogs will go crazy if they eat them..."</p>
<p>"I know that," he interjected, indicating his knowledge.</p>
<p>"Lately, I don't know why," she continued, "although red chain snakes are not born here, some white-patterned snakes and gray bald snakes often appear. Truly annoying, they, along with the foreign red chain snakes, make it so people can't live in peace. We have already killed quite a few of these snakes too..."</p>
<p>They were about to continue talking when he saw the people in the house had all come out, so he walked over to "their" group. It seemed someone was whispering to him for a while, and then he shouted sternly:</p>
<p>"Old woman, come over here, I still have questions to ask you!"</p>
<p>The old grandma knew what this was about, so she calmly walked over.</p>
<p>"Who else is in your family?" The man asked with a stern face after listening to the whispers next to him, his expression very different from before.</p>
<p>"There are also my son and daughter-in-law," she replied quietly.</p>
<p>"Where did they go?" The man whispered to someone next to him for a while, then asked.</p>
<p>"My son went to Qingzhen to sell wheat; my daughter-in-law is at her mother's house."</p>
<p>"It seems like many people have lived in your house!"</p>
<p>"Yes, we hired a few more workers a few days ago when we were busy in the fields."</p>
<p>"Unreliable!"</p>
<p>She didn't say anything, because she felt there was nothing to say.</p>
<p>Then they asked for a while, and she answered a few questions she could answer, and remained silent for those she couldn't, letting them do as they pleased.</p>
<p>After a few more whispers, "they" all stood up, ready to leave.</p>
<p>"Old woman, be careful: if there are 'bandits' here, people will be killed and houses will be burned down!"</p>
<p>This was the parting advice. The old grandma ignored them, silently watching "them" leave the village. When "they" were far away and out of sight, she shouted: "Aming, go fetch a bucket of water."</p>
<p>Not long after the fire was extinguished and the smoke cleared, Captain Wang Mingyuan led us all down the mountain and back to our original place. Because we knew "their" routine, "they" would return to Qingzhen the next day after making a round in the countryside and would never turn back.</p>
<p>As soon as Captain Wang saw the ashes in the field, he said, "What a pity, some fuel was wasted."</p>
<p>"There's nothing to regret," the old grandma said with a smile, "If there were real red chain snakes for me to burn, I would be willing to tear down the house and use it as fuel!"</p>
<p>After such an inquiry, the old grandma told them about the conversation just now.</p>
<p>"That's right, this is simply a venomous red chain snake, how clever of you to think of it!" We all said with a smile. "From now on, our work doesn't need any other name, let's just call it 'snake hunting'."</p>
<p>"You hunt, I burn," the old grandma said with a cheerful expression as she swept the ashes with a bamboo broom, "The hunters hunt, the burners burn, if there isn't enough fuel, my old bones won't matter!"</p>
<p>We resumed the work of threshing wheat, and at the same time, we further clarified the work of "snake hunting" in the future.</p>
<h3>Slacking</h3>
<p>— Qieqi</p>
<p>Friend, I often hear you say: "No retreat, no rest." Moreover, you have already stepped onto the path of truth.</p>
<p>Loneliness and depression tightly surround us, almost suffocating us to death. We live a prison-like life, shouting and complaining as much as possible, but who will pity us and release us?</p>
<p>At least we have never covered our faces and wept, and we have never grasped at death as it approaches; we are wholeheartedly trying to find a way out.</p>
<p>Although it is not comparable to a beast escaping from its cage, it can also be considered a small bird spreading its wings, free to fly in the sky. The road has been found, we have already started on it, and nothing will be difficult to achieve. The process may be bitter, but this is a new beginning. I believe there are countless things that can encourage and excite us. Friend, you seem to have thought this way too!</p>
<p>I don't understand why you repeatedly look back, what is there to be nostalgic about in a prison-like life? Comfortable enjoyment of abundant material possessions, friend, that is poison!</p>
<p>You are hesitating to move forward. Although you do not admit that this is retreating or resting, you are slacking, and your spirit will decline, and there will be no way to recover.</p>
<p>People who live a comfortable life of slavery forever are waving to you. I understand, they have tempted you. But we have shouted and complained before, have you forgotten that?</p>
<p>Your will may be at war, or you may have decided to turn back, and your actions have become so slack. Friend, please recognize it for a moment!</p>
<p>Since we have stepped onto the path of truth, how can we bear to separate halfway? Let us join hands and move forward!</p>

<h3>Foreign Rickshaws for Hire</h3>
<p>Announcement: This company has recently received new foreign rickshaws, which are very different from Chinese rickshaws. Regardless of whether it is sunny or raining, they can be pushed in the same way. The rickshaws also have awnings, so clothes don't get wet in the rain, which is especially ingenious. Merchants who wish to ride, please come to this company. Prices for various distances are listed below: From Shanghai city center to Hongkou River, that is, Inner Hongqiao, or a distance less than that, costs 10 cents. From Hongkou River to Hongkou Renji Wharf, 10 cents. From the French Bund to the Racecourse, 10 cents. From the English Bund to the Racecourse, 10 cents. From the Racecourse to Hongkou River, 10 cents. For longer journeys, the price is calculated by time: The first hour costs 20 cents. Each subsequent hour or part thereof costs 10 cents. If the rickshaw is hired and kept waiting, the price is calculated as follows: From Xujiahui to the river north of the Racecourse, an additional 20 cents is charged. From Hongkou Renji Wharf to Yangshupu Village, 50 cents. From Yangshupu to Wusong, 1 yuan. The price for children riding in the rickshaw is as follows: No charge for children under eight years old. Two children are counted as one person. From night until 6:00 AM, the prices listed above will be doubled.</p>

<h3>A Service Record of "Safety Campaign"</h3>
<p>— Zhixian</p>
<p>Grandmas and Nannies all said we are illiterate, the Special Resident lifted the bird cage and strutted.</p>
<p>On June 22nd, for the sake of the safety campaign, I was assigned to serve at the corner of Simalu (Fourth Avenue) and Guangxi Road.</p>
<p>Before setting off, the principal specifically summoned us, and in addition to giving us an armband, a small flag, and dozens of leaflets, he gave us a brief speech.</p>
<p>I arrived at the designated location at 8:20 AM, just in time for Office Time. Cars were connected end to end from the Racecourse, and there were also a lot of pedestrians, including grandmas and nannies returning from the small vegetable market. They walked along, carrying large and small baskets, while talking to their companions. They often walked three or four abreast, so there was always one or two who left the sidewalk and walked on the side of the road. They chattered and muttered, not stopping until the cars were right at their heels. I specifically distributed leaflets to these people, but most of them refused to accept them. Some said they were illiterate, and some said they had seen this thing countless times. Unfortunately, the leaflets printed for the safety campaign had been the same one for several days. The pictures were not very moving, the wording was not very popular, and especially because there were no colors, even the children were not interested! But we know that in ten traffic accident cases, at least seven of the victims are ignorant children.</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock, the Shanghai special residents carrying birdcages came from the Racecourse in an endless stream with their coats open. Their posture of walking with their chests and stomachs out made the women and children coming from the opposite direction have to give way, but just when the women and children stepped on the side of the road, either a car rushed from the front, or a rickshaw puller shouted to make way from behind. But the special residents still strutted forward, sometimes deliberately bumping into the women next to them with their butts, or even turning around and looking at the embarrassed and making hideous faces.</p>
<p>I said, "Sir, please don't walk with your arms crossed."</p>
<p>"What! Is there a way to walk?" He still strutted forward.</p>
<p>The road surface of Simalu, from "Zhungan Dawang" (a restaurant) to the Guangxi Road intersection, is so narrow that it can only accommodate two small Austins coming and going. However, to the east of this section, there are the small vegetable market and the famous Qinglian Pavilion. After ten o'clock, there are very few people coming and going to the small vegetable market, but the Qinglian Pavilion has many people coming in and out all day long. In addition, there are several tea rooms and restaurants, arranged facing each other, so cars for weddings, celebrations, and funerals are constantly coming and going on this road. To the west of this section, in addition to many restaurants, there are also the Da Luotian and Tianchan Stage two theaters, and when the curtain rises and falls, it is impossible to tell whether the car is driving in the crowd or the people are walking in the car! In such a crowded intersection, one policeman and two arms are naturally not enough to guarantee "safety"!</p>
<p>Speaking of policemen, in my short service time, I discovered many shortcomings. First, he condoned the gambling on the sidewalk by the chess stall owners, and did not interfere even after my request. Later, several of us classmates who were serving insisted that he drive them away. He then lazily whispered a few words to a man in a black Indian silk long shirt standing next to the chess stall, and the chess stall was immediately removed, which was really puzzling. Secondly, his traffic direction seemed to be particularly tolerant of cars. Sometimes the car was still at the entrance of the Racecourse, and he ignored the rickshaws and taxis waiting at both ends of Guangxi Road, so the vehicles at both ends of Guangxi Road gathered more and more.</p>
<p>Because of the blockade of Pingwang Street, people going from Simalu to Wumalu (Fifth Avenue) had to detour through Guangxi Road, so the number of pedestrians on Guangxi Road increased sharply. I believe that the reason why there have been so many traffic accident cases in Shanghai recently is not only due to the faults of pedestrians and drivers, but the biggest reason is that the area of the road cannot accommodate so many people and cars! Therefore, under such circumstances, relying solely on passively holding safety campaigns will not achieve perfect results in fact, and opening up several alleyway passages will benefit pedestrian safety more than we standing in the hot sun for a few days!</p>
<p>But in terms of the current environment, the safety threats faced by Shanghai people are indeed greater than the car accidents, but this seems to be a problem that cannot be solved by sending out a few leaflets and posting a few paper slogans; when I was wearily passing in front of the Fulai Hotel after serving, it was as if several cars were preparing to devour my flesh and blood! So I feel that this safety campaign held by the Public Works Department has given us another powerful revelation: "If we seek 'safety', we can hardly expect the 'integrity' of the tiles"!</p>
<h3>Overcrowding at Walton Prison</h3>
<p>— Birmingham</p>
<p>More Than Any Other Time in History, With a Continued Upward Trend</p>
<p>A Prisoner Purposely Commits a Crime to Go to Jail to Quit Smoking</p>
<p>Walton Prison—the largest prison in the world—has broken its record again. The total number of prisoners inside is no less than 7,377, which is more than at any other time in its history. For five years, the number of prisoners in this prison has not exceeded 7,000; during the war, its total number did decrease to 4,674. However, in the past few months, the number of prisoners has surged, reaching 7,000 again not many days ago, and it appears to be continuing to rise.</p>
<p>Walton Prison is well-known, and the prisoners living there are densely packed. A small number of prisoners commit minor crimes to stay inside for a few weeks. Last week, there was a case where a prisoner admitted that he had deliberately committed a crime to go to jail: it turned out that this person was addicted to opium, was in pain, and wanted to quit but couldn't. His friends told him to commit some minor crimes to get into Walton Prison, assuring him that he could indeed quit his addiction there. Therefore, this person stole something and was sentenced to three months in prison. He is now quitting smoking, and according to prison guards, he may be able to get rid of his addiction.</p>
<p>In January 1932, there were 6,745 prisoners in Walton Prison, all of whom were Chinese, not including foreign prisoners, as they were in the Xiamen Road Prison. However, within a few months, Walton Prison reached its highest prisoner population in its history, with a total of 7,251 people. Afterwards, although there were many fluctuations, it had decreased, with some being pardoned or conditionally released. Years passed, and the war of 1937 arrived. During the war, many prisoners were released, and more prisoners were originally to be released, but this plan was stopped. Shells hit the prison, killing several prisoners. Fewer prisoners were being imprisoned, so the number fell to 4,674, which was in October, when the war was about to move to the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>Then, the number began to gradually increase again, but according to the numbers, it would not reach the previous high level again. Since 1932, this prison has been expanded, adding a foreign prisoner section to replace the Xiamen Road Prison. The current number of Chinese prisoners is 7,140, which is less than the previous record high, but when combined with the 111 foreign prisoners and the 126 people in the reformatory, the total is 7,377, which is the highest prisoner record in the prison's history.</p>
<p>This situation was not expected. At the beginning of this year, there were a total of 6,312 Chinese people in the prison. The prison authorities, based on the possible increase in criminal cases, estimated that the prisoners in the prison this year would not exceed 7,000 at most, but it is now known that the estimate was wrong. Because of the increase in criminal cases (as can be seen in the Public Works Department's police and litigation reports), the number of prisoners in the prison exceeded expectations. Since March of this year, it has continued to increase without interruption, only decreasing slightly when prisoners were released at the end of each week and fewer were imprisoned.</p>
<p>The current total number of prisoners includes 25 prisoners who have been sentenced to death and are waiting to be executed; 79 with life sentences; 200 with sentences of 15 years or more; 563 with sentences of 10 years or more; 902 with sentences of 7 years or more; 761 with sentences of 5 years or more; 682 with sentences of 3 years or more; 524 with sentences of 2 years or more; 886 with sentences of 1 year or more; 1,207 with sentences of 6 months or more; 828 with sentences of 3 months or more; 167 with sentences of 2 months or more; 146 with sentences of 1 month or more; 169 with sentences of a few days or more; and one prisoner who has not been sentenced.

<h3>Sunshine After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Encourage Studying Agriculture to Store Talent for the Country, Retaining the Strong and Eliminating the Weak to Select Seeds With a Field</p>
<p>He Liyu said, "I want to ask the village chief, in this Free Village, besides the weaving factory we are currently planning to set up, are there any other factories set up here?" Village Chief Zhu said, "Yes! If you open this silk weaving factory, it will be the third one. Originally, when we initially organized this Free Village, we did not plan for people to set up any factories. Because our old village was burned down by the enemy, the houses were all gone, and the fields were also barren. So after the war, we planned an area and started anew. We people originally farmed, and we still farm now. Many of the fields from before were still owned by landlords and rented to people to farm, dividing them into categories like landowners and tenants. There were also a few wealthy farmers who hired long-term workers and used their labor, with all the harvests belonging to them. After the war, we implemented what Mr. Sun Yat-sen said before: 'The tillers should own their land.' There is no longer a distinction between landowners and tenants. Originally, many of us here farmed our own land. Several large landlords died or became poor, and some had their property confiscated because they committed treasonous acts. Therefore, all the land belongs to the village, and the farmers have organized collective farms, each contributing their strength and receiving their benefits, and the distribution is considered fair. They elected me as the village chief, and I don't have much education, but I just do things according to my conscience. At first, we just wanted to restore our old farming business. In addition, we wanted a school, because farmers who can't read feel too distressed. We didn't count on setting up factories here. Moreover, there are several conservative old gentlemen in the village who don't want factories here. They say: 'Factories' are bound to have workers, and these workers may come from other places and may not be of good character, which will ruin the good morals of our Free Village." These words are indeed laughable; but the factories in a place are very much related to that place. At first, we didn't think about opening a factory in Free Village, but in recent years, China's factories have gradually developed. Several large cities can no longer accommodate them, so they are scattered to various towns and villages. The year before last, a silkworm seed manufacturing farm was set up here. This seed manufacturing farm is run by the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Bureau, because the silkworm seeds produced by their original seed manufacturing farms are not enough for distribution, so they set up this one. This seed manufacturing farm is also the thirteenth seed manufacturing farm. Although those seed manufacturing farms don't raise many silkworms, they also have to choose a suitable place. Moreover, they themselves don't grow mulberry trees, so they also have to choose a place with the best mulberry fields." (147)</p>

<p>Mao Shilai, along with his fellow disciples of the Shilai generation, has performed in "Golden Stage" for the second time, becoming extremely popular and famous, an unprecedented success. Shilai's contract with "Golden Stage" has expired, and he will triumphantly return home soon. Succeeding Mao is Yan Jupeng, known for his "unparalleled tone and rhythm" and "authentic Tan school" style.</p>
<p>Mao Shilai's visit to the South this time can be said to have been a resounding success. Shilai's art has indeed improved a lot, and his mastery of the Xun school has reached a state of transformation. After returning to the North, Xun Huisheng will take Shilai as his disciple. Shilai's art, learning from Xun, can be said to be appropriate. It is hoped that he will not be arrogant or slack, and will do his best, then Xun will have a successor.</p>
<p>Accompanying Mao this time, Gao Shenglin became popular, and Sha Shixin became unpopular. Shenglin's previous visit to Shanghai was not noticed, but this time his voice is excellent, and his singing, recitation, acting, and martial arts skills have all improved. He also resembles Yang Xiaolou by three points. His ability to be welcomed by the audience is not without reason. Among the martial arts performers in the North, there are very few good performers below Xiaolou. If Shenglin can train harder, he will definitely be able to secure a place for himself in the future. Sha Shixin's failure lies in his lack of voice and his inability to please the audience, which has prevented him from meeting the tastes of the people of Shanghai. In fact, Shixin's style of play is very standard, and his appearance is also quite good. We should not judge Shixin's entire career based on the current situation. Shixin must not be discouraged by being "unpopular." You must know that "becoming unpopular" is the first step to becoming popular. Looking at Shenglin's previous lack of attention and his current popularity, it is a good example. Shixin, do your best.</p>
<p>In addition to Sha and Gao, Jiang Shiyu and Ai Shiju, who co-starred with Shilai, are top-notch. Shiyu's young male roles have a scholarly air, and he is proficient in both civil and martial arts, truly a person after Ye Shenglan. Ai Shiju's clown role is good in that he is not annoying, and his acting is not over the top. Watching him perform in "Nan Jie Guan," you can even feel a bit of Kunqu opera flavor. His actions are quite good, and he is rare among the clown roles in the North. Ma Lianliang cannot match him. Shiju's ability to perform in both civil and martial arts is also commendable. He is the most praiseworthy of all the people who came with Mao. As for Sheng Rong and Guan Shengxi, they are all senior disciples of the Shilai generation. They are a bit older, and their skills are naturally much more refined. Sheng Rong and Shengxi are already accomplished performers.</p>
<h3>Charity Tea Dance Competition Sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association</h3>
<p>— Xin Shi</p>
<p>Starting July 1st, Famous Dancers Will Compete for Honors</p>
<p>As Shanghai becomes an isolated island, under an extremely depressing atmosphere, disaster relief efforts are the work that everyone should do. Many flexible daughters swirl in jazz music and neon lights every day. It seems that although they are full of laughter, they are all like the groups of merchants who don't know the sorrow of national subjugation. But in reality, that kind of dancing to please customers and smiling to greet people can be said to be their professional duty and the attitude they should have. They should not shirk their responsibilities for all public welfare matters and will not be behind others. For example, holding drama charity performances and assisting in fundraising, etc., they have already tried their best in the past and have created several major achievements.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to enable people to do their best and to enable the dancing girls to have effective opportunities, through the fundraising committee of the dance hall group under its jurisdiction, initiated a plan to unite all the dance stars in the dance halls to hold a very grand "Charity Tea Dance Competition" for a month. After contacting all parties separately in recent days, everyone was happy to hear the news and felt extremely excited. All the methods were quickly agreed upon, and it was decided that they would be mobilized on July 1st to engage in large-scale activities.</p>
<p>The venue for the tea dance conference was decided to be at the Ciro's Plaza. The date is from July 1st, temporarily limited to one month. The time is set from 3 pm to 8 pm every day. A special kind of lucky fruit ticket is printed for the dance ticket, each ticket is one yuan, and one ticket is for three dances. These lucky fruit tickets are divided into two types, each book is ten yuan and five yuan. They will be sold soon, and the dance girls of each hall are requested to enthusiastically recognize and sell them. Regarding the distribution of dance girls, each dance factory will designate 30 to 35 excellent dance girls. Seven days is one period, and each period is divided into seven groups. Each group will send four people from Monday to Friday, and five people each on Saturday and Sunday. The hybrid organization method is adopted to make the red dance stars of each family participate equally, just like a "famous actors meeting", with a general gathering every day. The organizers have reward methods for the dance stars who participate enthusiastically. In addition to preparing various honorary trophies, certificates of merit, and thank you prizes, the trade groups of the association's various commercial categories will also collect a large number of gifts from major stores and national goods factories, and publicly display them at a predetermined location in advance. After the end of the tea dance conference, when the closing ceremony is held, they will be distributed to the dance stars with excellent results as a glorious memory.</p>
<p>Entertainment for disaster relief, this entertainment is really meaningful. And for the enthusiastic sisters in the dance world, this is a good opportunity to serve their compatriots. At the same time, their competition for the first place among all the dance stars in Shanghai and the first place among the excellent stars in each dance hall is very different from the unconscious "dance world election". Because everything is for relieving refugees, that is a very glorious thing, and it is also a conscientious work that everyone should do their best to do. Therefore, in the coming month, under the competitive progress of the total mobilization of national dance stars, the result will be very satisfactory, and it will create immeasurable blessings for the disaster-stricken compatriots, which is absolutely assured.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Fall of Layman Woyun and the Advancement of Li Duokui</p>
<p>When Duokui officially performed as an old female role, he had to worship an old female role teacher as usual. At that time, Woyun made trouble and failed to become a student of Fei, so he was introduced by Lu Wu and became a student of Luo Fushan. When he returned north with a good reputation, he also went to Jinan, Taiyuan, and other places to perform many times. His reputation grew day by day, and his income increased daily, and his family gradually became well-off. At the same time, he was also very filial. No matter how much money he earned outside, he handed it all over to his father to keep, and only took six or seven yuan of pocket money per month, except for necessary entertainment. Although he was an insider, he liked to make friends with outsiders, especially those with knowledge. If he had any doubts or misunderstandings about the lyrics of a certain play, he would always ask others and ask them to explain it to him. His daily attire was very elegant, with absolutely no bad habits of insiders. He loved collecting fan faces with calligraphy and paintings by famous people, and now he has saved more than a hundred pieces. In the years before Lao Lan died, he also officially accepted him into his inner circle of students. The above is all the truth about Duokui's increasing progress in the past ten years. Let's take a look at that Layman Woyun, who became famous before him. In the recent seven or eight years, he has deteriorated and fallen in the opposite direction. The custom of the Beijing Pear Garden is still to exclude outsiders invisibly. Although Woyun has officially gone to sea, he is lazy and playful, and he does not often perform. He usually does not associate with insiders. Except for a few years ago when he co-starred with Ju Peng twice, he has not been seen since then. Later, someone spread the news that he had been cohabitating with a woman four years ago. This woman had a little savings in her hand, so he hid, as if he had said goodbye to the opera world and would never work as an actor again. His voice had been ruined a few years ago because he did not practice often, and he could not sing anymore. (46)</p>
<h3>Paris's New Rising Chain Dance</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The new type of social dance "Lambeth Walk," which was once popular in Shanghai, originated in London and was developed in New York. Because it is easy to learn and interesting, men, women, old and young, all love it. Following this, there are also so-called "Apple Dance" and "Umbrella Dance." All imitate this kind of funny format. According to the 14th "International Dance Art Conference" held in Paris in early June, a kind of "Chain Dance" (Roll-skip) has been invented, which will replace Lambeth Walk.</p>
<p>This ring format is more wonderful and abrupt than other dance steps. The virgin public performance was once held in the Magic Hall of the French capital, performed by Parisian dancers Luceni and Ms. Simon, with great success. The inventors of this dance are the 30 contestants participating in the Dance Art Conference competition, all of whom are collective creations by world amateur dance champion Englishman Wattsworth and international professional dance champion Naldon and others. It is considered to be extremely beautiful. Soon, all dance fans will be called to vote publicly to decide whether it is the "most beautiful dance in the world," and then it will be promoted to the world.</p>

<h3>Mr. Hongdou's Outstanding Disciple, the Talented Amateur Xiao Ming</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shiyu</p>
<p>Mr. Hongdou, Xi Yuan, is the only famous amateur in the sea, proficient in Sheng, Dan, Jing, Chou, Wen, Wu, Kun, Luan (all types of opera roles), and especially broad and profound in Kunqu opera. He is called a Kunqu opera master by the people of the time. Recently, he has been ill in Shanghai, living in seclusion, and entertaining himself with poetry and prose every day. The other day, I met him at a friend's place, and in the idle talk, I mentioned the brief history of Ms. Xiao Ming, who sang the finale of the charity opera of the Refugee Relief Association of the Shanghai Native Place Group. I learned that Ms. Xiao Ming was a disciple of Mr. Hongdou, and then I inquired in detail. The master said:</p>
<p>"Ms. Xiao is originally from Xiangxiang, Hunan, and grew up in Peiping. Her father, Zi Sheng, once held an important official position in the Republic of China and is now living in France. Ms. Xiao was born intelligent, and at the age of twelve, she was able to perform on stage singing "The Dream of Lizhu," "Hong Bi Xi," "The Satisfactory Marriage," and "The Celebration Top Pearl." Later, she learned sword and horse opera from Yu Yuqin, and her skills improved even more. All the famous leading actors in the old capital admired her very much. The year before last, my old friend, Ling Zhi, introduced her to learn Kunqu opera. Her voice is high-pitched, round, and moist, very similar to Xiao Mei. I was surprised by this. At first, she assisted with "Selling Horses," and in less than three days, she was able to perform the movements. The movements in Kunqu opera are the most difficult. Even a small movement cannot be sloppy, but she performed them without any errors. She is truly a genius. I taught her the complete "Eternal Life Palace," "Jinshan Temple," "Qin Tao," "Thinking of the World," "Chunxiang闹学","游园惊梦","刺虎","瑶台","乔酷" and other plays. She understood them all one by one. I have about 300 disciples, but Ms. Xiao is the most outstanding. She rarely sings after coming to Shanghai, because she is studying in the liberal arts department of Jinan University. This performance is actually to plead for the refugees." The master never praises people, which shows Ms. Xiao's intelligence and deep skills. This time she will perform "The Satisfactory Marriage" as the finale to meet the people in Shanghai, which is truly a feast for the eyes.</p>
<h3>Yan Jupeng and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yan Jupeng, Yan Shaopeng, Yan Huizhu, and other 30 performers, including Hou Yulan, arrived in Shanghai on the Shengjing ship at 6:30 yesterday morning. The manager of the troupe, Sun Lanting, Wu Jiangfeng, Wang Qijun, and others went to greet them and stayed at the Jinlao Hotel. They will pay visits to their guests in the next few days and will take the stage on July 1st.</p>

<p>Opening Method 47th Round</p>
<p>Black First</p>
<p>Cannon Against Screen Horse</p>
<p>The Method is Connected to the Previous Round</p>
<p>Horse 4 Advances to 3 Cannon 8 Moves to 5 Bishop 4 Advances to 5 Horse 8 Advances to 9 Horse 3 Advances to 1 Elephant 7 Advances to 9 Explanation</p>
<p>The main idea of ​​this month's opening method is to use the Cannon to break the Screen Horse. The main method is to send the Central Soldier and then regain the Central Pawn, aiming to open the middle road, and then be able to drive straight in. It is the same as the artillery side's pawn 5 advances to 1, and the red side should advance the elephant 3 to 5. It seems unimportant on the surface, but I don't know that it has already lost the first move in the dark. Rook 2 moves to 3 to catch the horse, forcing the red side to move the horse 3 advances to 4, pawn 5 advances to 1 sends the soldier forcing the red side to move pawn 5 advances to 1, Cannon 8 advances to 3 crosses the river, Cannon strikes horse and pawn, the momentum is turbulent.</p>
<p>From Horse 4 Advances to 3 to Horse 8 Advances to 9, at this time the red side is forced to exchange the horse 3 advances to 1 for the horse, it is better to exchange the cannon, one mistake after another, so the red side lost the first move.</p>
