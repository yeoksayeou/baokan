<p>社評</p>
<h3>目前的上海市民應該怎樣</h3>
<p>這兩天上海的市街上，遍貼着兩租界當局的會銜佈告，取締一切政治性質的團體活動；每一個上海市民，對於這樣切身的環境，當然會加以深切的注意，而且也會發生各種不同的感想。可是希望市民，更具有下列幾點共通的認識</p>
<p>一、目前上海的形勢非常緊張，歐美方面的觀察也這樣說：「自中日戰爭開始以來，上海情勢，要以目前為最嚴重。」說不定上海市民今晚安睡下去，明早揉揉眼睛，就換了一個局面。在這樣的情勢之下，租界當局的那種措施，當然是善意的。我們可以在佈吿的文句裏，玩味出當局負責保護居民生命財產的苦心和誠意，這一點，凡租界內的居民都應該承認。</p>
<p>二、租界當局發出這樣的佈吿，當然不是無的放矢，也決不是對於界內居民有所懷疑，預防他們對當局的治權有何不利的舉動。那末，佈告的用意是什麼呢？不可諱言的，所謂取締政治性質的團體活動，無非就是日本方面屢次警吿租界當局而絮聒不休的所謂華入愛國行動罷了。然而，我們不必抱着杞憂，以為租界當局此决的措施，即是斷送上海的表示。我們與其說這是租界當局為日方而發，母寗說這是保持租界的一種方法。據十二日華盛頓電訊說，英美兩國現正密切令作，準備對日本最後關於上海公共租界所提要求，予以正式答種。可見這回的的束居民，無非是一種「免貽口實」的提議；我們應該平心靜氣，接受這種提議；譬如家長對人家說「你們不用干涉我家的事，我已經把家裏的人的束好了，」這句話我們不能看做菲薄家裘的人。當然上海租界當局決不會迥護居民的政治活動，但是我們也不能由此推測當局，說他們承認了惡勢力的壓迫</p>
<p>三、兩租界當局會銜出這樣的一張佈告，可以說是一件尋常而又不尋常的事。因為應付一種特殊局勢，租界當局一定要請示其各本國政府，決不會自作主張的；此次的會銜佈告，顯見得有關係的各國，正醞釀着一種聯合動作，預備在對付日本的要求上，取一致的應付態度。由前面所引的華府電訊，可知英美兩國已經密切合作；至於英法閒的一致，那是無可疑問的。這樣看起來，在遠東問題上，民治國家也是有他的一些曙光。</p>
<p>四、當局所取締的，是一切政治性質的團體活動，可知非政治性質的團體活動並不在禁阻之列。上海的布民自從失去了政府的領導以後，本來就抱着一種沉着的態度、根本沒有什麼政治性質的團體活動可言。至於一切合法的，非政治性質的團體組織，那是很普遍的，而且上海的市民，本來也就把這種組織當做貢獻力量的途徑。例如募捐，獻金，濟難等工作，往往就利用固有的團體來進行，而上海市民也就在這上面，盡了本位上的力量，實行了所謂「有力出力，有錢出錢。」目前，上海市民在這樣的工作上，依舊可以努力，絲毫不必自餒，因為租界當局對於合法的非政治性質的組織，是不會仇視的。</p>
<p>五、所謂「取締政治活動」這句話的對象，是很普遍的，對於正反兩面的極端動作與組織，俱在取締之列。今日的上海市民，一方面固然同情當局的苦心，原諒他們措施的不得已；但是同時也深切地瞭解，就是當局對於一切不法的政治活動與組織，也必然地會加以嚴厲處置的。我們深信賢明的當局，必然把「公允」做一切措施的最高原則，決不會使居民失望的。</p>
<p>上海市民除認識了上列幾點以外，還必須有什麼行動，才可以和認識配合起來？</p>
<p>第一，每一個上海市民應該矢志自誓，雖沒有團體的活動，但決不苟安，決不躱避，根據本位，發揮良知，隨時隨地爭取愛國愛民族的自由。要知道愛國家愛民族的人決不怕做那一種工作；然而最怕沒有工作。</p>
<p>第二，租界當局旣然並沒有妥協屈服於惡勢力之下的表示，上海市民應該愛護當局，用一致的態度，堅決的力量，支持當局，把不妥協不屈服的精神持久下去，做遠東國際聯合陣綫的胚胎。</p>

<h3>巴黎歡迎</h3>
<p>（巴黎）英相張伯倫今日所發關於土耳其之官言、此間予以熱切歡迎、法國之宣言尙未備就、其延遲乃因法土談判地中海與亞力山大萊德之散嘉克援助事尙未葳事之故、（十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>日企圖佔據租界　美政府表示決心　　授權外交代表應付一切　鼓浪嶼事件無正式報吿</h3>
<p>兩租界當局佈吿係出諸自動</p>
<p>授權代表　應付事變</p>
<p>美聯社華盛頓十二日電、國務卿赫爾昨日語新聞界云、美國當事之外交代表、現由政府授權、處理上海方面及其他各處當地所發生之種種困難、赫爾稱、關於日本海軍發言人昨日在滬聲明、謂日軍或覺有佔據上海公共租界英美防區之必要等宣吿、國務卿並未接獲此種消息、若日人一旦企圖佔據公共租界、關於在滬美國當局採取之可能態度、赫爾則拒絕批評、</p>
<p>或將採取　經濟制裁</p>
<p>海通社華盛頓十三日電、美國權威人士、對於日軍佔領鼓浪嶼公共租界一事、仍持緘默態度、惟政界人士則極表重視、因恐日軍將在上海採取同樣步騾故也、據政界人士表示、倘日本竟甘冒不韙、佔領上海租界、則美國或將採取對日經濟制裁、</p>
<p>路透社十二日華盛頓電、自日軍佔據鼓浪嶼之消息傳來後、國務院某昌語人曰美團與該地之公共租界有關、將密切注意其發展、</p>
<p>鼓浪嶼案　尙無報吿</p>
<p>海通社華盛頓十三日電、美國國務卿赫爾、昨日接見新聞記者、發表對於日軍佔領鼓浪嶼之談話、宣稱美國政府此時尙不能判斷日軍該項行動之重要程度、因尙未接到美國駐華外交代表之正式報吿故也、記者詢以倘日本在上海採取同樣步驟、則美國是吾將出而干涉、赫氏答稱、美國駐華當局、已奉到政府關於應付緊急事變之訓令矣、最後記者詢以美國駐日大使格魯昨訪問日本外務省之任務如何、赫氏答稱、格魯訪問日本外務省、是吾由於渠本人自動、抑係應日政府之邀、渠尙不得而知、不過華盛頓並無此種訓令、哈瓦斯社十三日倫敦電、據外務部接近人士宣稱、日本軍隊在中國鼓浪嶼登陸之舉、並不違反國際條的、英國政府未必提出抗議、但日軍當局倘干預該處公共租界行政、或侵犯外國僑民權利、則當別論云、</p>
<p>外人方面消息、現在福州之美國驅逐艦「勃爾末」號、已奉令駛往鼓浪嶼、今日可抵該處、英國驅逐艦「特考爾」號、迄今止尙未接獲英國財產遭受損失之報告、</p>
<h3>日有佔據公共租界企圖</h3>
<p>字林報云、日海軍發言人在昨日（十二日）招待記者席上、答復佔據鼓浪嶼之連帶關係及上海可能的後果之問話云、如發生嚴重事件、日方或有佔據上海公共租界之必要、發言人談及佔據鼓浪嶼一事、極言該島發生暗殺企圖時、當地日本艦隊司令官亦在島上、故必須予以保護、再關於取締反日活動事、日方以前已向鼓浪嶼工部局數度抗議、但彼等迄無行動、有詢是吾爲暫時佔據、發言人答渠個人相信如是、但除非鼓浪嶼工部局採取適當手段、以饜日方要求、則日方陸戰隊或將被迫</p>
<p>留駐該地</p>
<p>若然、則爭案更複複雜矣、日兵未佔工部局大廈或公共應用物、僅在各街巡證而巳、某記者詢、預料日軍將佔上海之公共租界否、發方人答、如起嚴重事件、或有此必要、某記者掙問、將連外國軍隊管理各區同佔之乎、發言人稱、此點</p>
<p>將視情勢</p>
<p>而定、但渠不願討論此事、有詢佔據鼓浪嶼將吾廢化該地公共租界之地位、發言人未能答覆此問日本大使館發言人宣稱上海兩租界之工部局及公董局於星期四日頒佈之吿示、乃饜日方要求取締恐怖主義及控制其他</p>
<p>破壞活動</p>
<p>之努力、兩租界當局如何厲行其文吿、及將如何奏效、須俟他日覘之、某記者詢日方對此種綏靖政策將吾保留其態度、發言人對此未置確切答覆、但認爲此係向滿足日方要求前進之一種步騾、海軍發言人又答複關於意輪德平號近載小麥聲藥物品及藥醫隊前往寗波、被</p>
<p>日方扣留</p>
<p>之問話云、日當局不歡迎載運『或有助於延長蔣政權抗日之一切物品』、眞實之藥醫物品、並不加禁止、但除救濟傷病者外、或供其他目的應用之化學物品、則不准自日軍佔據區運往仍由華方扼守之寗波與溫州、</p>
<p>關於會銜　佈吿事件</p>
<p>大陸報云、公共租界工部局發言人、昨日（十二日）聲稱、工部局與公董局星期四日頒佈之會銜吿示、日方雖力稱爲邇來日方提特殊耍求之結果、其實不然、蓋兩租界當局之出此、全出已意也、但已往日方會請頒此令云、據日方發言人昨日午後招待各報記者時聲稱、日當局視此次吿示爲日方與兩外國管理區</p>
<p>更趨諒解</p>
<p>之確切步驟、今祇待視其實行此吿示之精神云、發言人作此語前又稱、是項吿示、乃日當局向工部局與公董局提出關於兩區中恐怖主義與反日活動的多决抗議之直接結果云、是項吿示之頒佈、華字報紙雖尙未加以評論、但昨日巳引起華人各界之紛紛批評、某著名</p>
<p>華商領袖</p>
<p>語記者稱、觀於兩租界目前之動盪不安、此間華人居民對工部局所取政策、不致感覺過份之危險、但此爲本埠行政機關對日方之一大讓步無疑云、某華籍銀行家對頒佈吿示之精神、表示贊同、據稱、希望工部與公董兩局言行相符、如讓吿示當爲法律</p>
<p>不僅適用</p>
<p>於華人團體、亦且適用於各國人民、包括日人及傀儡華人在內者、則渠雖不希望有此吿示、但亦爲之滿意、獨恐兩局對外人管理區中之華人加以壓制、而對傀儡政權之華人、則在日方壓力下面極度寬容耳、如華人在此間有政治活動、須知</p>
<p>傀儡進行</p>
<p>此種活動尤甚、若外人管理區希望維持其中立者、須同時禁止此間之傀儡團體云、復有少數居民與記者討論此事、對工部與公董兩局之行動、表示憤懣、其一聲稱、彼等不應忘却中國國民政府乃各國所承認、而此間之各國代表、竟欲抑制中國居民之所謂「政治活動」、</p>

<p>考慮訂購　洋米運滬</p>
<p>米業評價委員會、爲未雨綢繆起見、特建議兩租界當局、訂購洋米、運滬接濟、疏通國米來源、以維民食、聞租界當局巳允考慮訂購洋米、將先提交米糧聯合委員會研究、新聲社記者昨向米業界探悉、蕪湖·無錫·等處國米、已爲壟斷、阻止裝運來滬、故疏通該兩地之來源、事實上頗有困難之處、故希望租界設法予以疏通、因爲米業權力所不及、訂購洋米、照目前價格、運滬非但無利可圖、目須虧耗、</p>
<p>函請派員　指示機宜</p>
<p>該會除建議兩租界當局、訂購巨量洋米運滬接濟、並請派員參加指示機宜外、複於昨日致函上海市商會云、（上略見建議租界當局書）二月以來、力竭聲嘶、而來日方長、前途可虞、實有非敝委員會所能勝仟者、補救之策、維有懇請鈞台派員參加、隨時指示機宜、俾米業有所遵循、市况得以安定、諒鈞會爲全市民食計、必能允予參加也、其二、欲求米價之平準·限價·調查·登記等、均係治標辦法、至治本之策、端在謀來源之豐富、若來源阻滯、而僅賴現有存米、雖嚴訂限價、終難維持於不敝、處今日情勢之下、欲求來源豐富、僅有二途可循、一爲擬請租界當局仿照前年成例、訂購大宗洋米、運滬儲備、則民食自可無處、米價即易壓平、二爲擬請租界當局設法疏通內地來源、蓋蘇省米糧、以無鍚地方爲集中點、皖省以蕪湖地方爲集中點、向來滬地食糧、粳·秈·二種、大批取給於該二地、今此二地業已先後禁阻米糧運出、近日滬地來源之稀、市價之漲、其主因即在於此、販米客商、茍有薄利可圖、無不竭力購運、而乃格於情勢、徒喚奈何、惟有仰賴租界當局、設法疏通、務使大宗產米無錫·蕪湖·二地、每日或每月各有相當數量、運輸至滬、源源不絕、則其效果、與訂購洋米相等、茲已由敝委員會建議租界當局、於此二者、擇一施行、則勝於各項治標方法多多矣、以上所陳、一爲懇請鈞會參加評價委員會之組織、二爲建議租界當局訂購洋米、或疏通內地來源、皆爲目前急要之務、除致函兩租界當局外、用特備函陳請、至祈察照、准予派員參加、俾資遵循、無任企禮、</p>

<p>據與政界有關係方面宣稱、上海『新申報』曾刊登陳立夫在渝有發表主和之言論、並壓迫共黨活動等消息、此種離奇報道、其目的顯在淆亂國人視聽、分化中央力量、實不値一笑、立夫先生自全面抗戰發動後、勗勉全黨同志全國同胞、精神團結、一致爲抗建大業而努力、對黨國之貢獻甚鉅、因此對方對彼之嫉恨亦愈深矣、</p>

<h3>鮮豬實行停宰　肉業全體停巿　尊重巿容決不關門　期望當局妥籌善後</h3>
<p>鮮猪來源、遭虹口「牲畜市塲」非法刦奪斷絕後、兩租界內之宰牲公司、實行停宰、鮮肉同業被迫停市、決不關門、以尊重租界市容、惟期望當局妥籌辦法、爲之善後、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>鮮猪運滬　竟吿絕跡</p>
<p>鮮猪行業同業聲明立塲、誓不參加非法組織之後、由新港運滬之鮮猪、迭遭虹口「牲畜市塲」非法刦奪、經客主向承運之輪船公司交涉無效、以致對運滬之猪、視爲長途、猪商裏足、來源幾絕、日艦在長江下游各地、又阻撓英輪裝運鮮猪、雖經央海軍抗議無效、各販運客人、因無保障、業已先後去電止辦、於是自上星期起鮮猪之運滬、竟吿絕跡、</p>
<p>宰牲公司　停止宰猪</p>
<p>上海之宰猪公司、爲公共租界内之蘇錫宰牲公司、地址北成都路一〇五〇弄五〇號、新寗海宰牲公司、地址北成都路一〇五〇弄四號、法租界工部局宰牲處、地址敏體尼蔭路二九六號、平時每日所宰之猪、三公司總的二千五百頭，今因鮮猪來源斷絕、以致無猪可宰、不得已於十三日晨起、一律停止宰猪、並將存棧猪隻、於十二日一律宰竣、</p>
<p>鲜肉店攤　一律停巿</p>
<p>公共租界及法租界內鮮肉同業、包括肉攤等、總约二千餘家、分蘇錫奪滬四大帮、因鮮猪業運滬之猪、迭遭「牲畜市塲」扣留、以致來源斷絕、無貨應市、並經分別集議決定、即日起被迫一律暫時不賣、惟決不關門、以尊重租界之市容、並勸吿職工留守店內、不許外出、以「不發空議論都做安分事」兩句格言、普勸同業一體遵照、絕對禁止私藏暗售、</p>
<p>事出被迫　決不關門</p>
<p>連日巿塲鮮肉以致售價飛漲、同業領袖、巳切實勸吿禁止抬高價格、昨日市塲行市、同行拆價每元一斤十兩、門市腿肉每元一斤四兩、五花每元一斤八兩、惟兩租界內之肉攤、因鮮肉來源斷絕、不得巳自動停業者、已在五百家以上、所以各小菜塲內之肉攤較前大减、至於勉强營業各肉店肉攤、十五日之後、將無肉可售、惟依照同業決議、決不關門、</p>
<p>期望當局　妥籌善後</p>
<p>昨向鮮猪行業及鮮肉業探悉、今鮮猪運滬、因遭「牲畜市塲」非法刦奪、以致鮮猪同業電江北止辦貨物、宰牲公司被迫停宰、鮮肉同業被迫停市、影響整個滬市肉食、惟事出無奈希望各界同情諒解、此後唯一期望兩租界當局、速籌妥善辦法、爲之善後、而維正當商人之營業、以免影響數百萬市民之肉食、</p>
<p>僞方扣猪　無地囤畜</p>
<p>日僞組織之「牲畜巿塲一、自經本巿鮮猪業行號拒絕參加後、偽「市塲」爲實施壓迫之陰謀、將內地猪隻、統制販運、概由日淸公司各輪裝運來滬、且與吉林豐報關行勾結、狼狽爲奸、偷漏關稅等情、至猪商販運之鮮猪、不論裝運任何外商輪船、即由日海軍當局、橫加扣留、或勒迫停裝、現該偽「市塲」雖由新港運滬之猪隻、日有二千餘頭、原冀企圖獨佔滬市行銷、但經同業一致拒絕、並監視同業、不准販售來路不明之猪肉後、故偽「市塲無法兜銷、而未宰之活猪、日種愈多，無地囤畜、據由該一市塲」方面傳出之消息、日偽對此非常焦慮、且每日必有死猪數頭、値茲天氣炎熱、寓一發現猪瘟、則影響於滬市衛生者、至重且鉅、現同業方面、希望市民勿貪買肉價低廉、而來路不明之鮮肉、妨碍身體健康、</p>
<p>牛羊鷄鴨　業之表示</p>
<p>據向本市牛羊鷄鴨兩同業方面探詢、關於「牲畜市塲」非法統制販運牲畜、其壓迫方式、日益嚴重、現鮮猪巳被迫停市、如此種行爲、加諸牛羊鷄鴨兩業之時、將如何應付、當經各該業表示、現兩業情形、亦巳深遭非法「市塲」壓迫之痛苦、但爲尊重人格、與維護正當商業立塲起見、除切實誥誡全體同業、不得參加僞「巿塲」營業、誓不合作外、如今後僞方以壓迫鮮猪業之手段而移諸壓迫我牛羊鷄鴨兩業時、亦唯有犧牲營業對付、</p>
<h3>南巿僞警反正　向滬閔公路方面而去　現已加入游擊隊抗戰</h3>
<p>偽「警察局」南市分局偽警六名、於昨晚（十二日）携械突然反正、偽分局長王芝章聞訊、急電報吿日駐軍菊池部隊、派兵追擊、該項反正偽警、早沿國貨路向滬閔公路方面而去、日軍追趕不及、徒勞往返、一無所獲、聞偽警此决突然反正、係不堪日軍壓迫、毅然出此、現已加人游擊隊、爲國抗戰、</p>
<h3>越南稅關禁令嚴　旅客國境備遭困苦　如携刀片及火柴均須罰　甚至有於握手時贈紙幣者</h3>
<p>邇來由海道赴川滇各地者、輒須道出法屬越南、該地稅關禁令綦嚴、旅客往往因不知其詳、而携帶私用物品、致干犯禁例、受累無窮、本期密勒氏評論週刊載有　John　D.氏之投函、詳述越南稅關之禁例、爰譯載如决、俾旅行奢閱之、愼事預防也、余閱四月二十九日貴刊所載一文、詳紀華人旅行道出越南者因受種種待遇所發不平之鳴、俾衆注意及之、余友數人、曾躬受經騐、故余能徵實該文所述各節、茲略述一二、想必爲</p>
<p>讀者樂聞</p>
<p>也、余近接某君一函、其人曾由海防中國總領事接見、故渠經過稅關時、未受滋擾、但曾目擊其同船者數人所受之待遇、彼等行李中或身上顯未携有新物、修面刀片、祇准携帶兩三片、甚至新牙刷亦須納稅、火柴絕對禁携、如旅客偶携火柴匣、則有時須按根數令繳罰鍰、襯衫如會經熨燙平整者、亦認爲新者而令納稅、某客因携</p>
<p>罐頭菓品</p>
<p>兩聰、被罰五披亞斯特、（的合華幣十元）蓋照章祇許携一聽也、安南人之行爲、往往較其法國主人變本加厲、其待遇衣服都麗者、似允較普通爲刻、估稅與罰鍰、似無一定章程、如旅客圖向解釋、或與爭辯、則罰鍰立刻加倍、苟再呶呶、則又加倍、不付罰鍰、則以監禁爲威嚇、此種威嚇、是吾實行、作函者不之知也、</p>
<p>賄賂盛行</p>
<p>亦如衆料、據作函者稱、有種種方法、使旅客獲得較優之待遇、旅客所携之衣箱、往往將其箱中所有傾於不潔之地板、俾便關吏之險查、查畢、當然須由旅客自己重行裝好、而無人爲助、旅客數人爲免此種被擾計、而將紙幣置於被禁之火柴匣內、因此而被沒收、亦有在與關吏握手之前、將紙幣藏於掌中者、余意貴刊發表此種事實、確殊有益於上海等處之華人也、</p>
<h3>救火會志願後備隊　獎勵辦法</h3>
<p>工部局爲獎勵救火會志願後備隊隊員長期服務起見、巳制定一種頒發獎章辦法、凡隊員服務滿十二年、平日實地辦事幹練者、得由主管人員保舉、請領獎章、以後每五年得加發獎帶一决、獎章式樣、與警務獎章相同、以資劃一、</p>
<h3>赤裸裸的合作　當筵作裸體跳舞　日情報局主任在滬表演　東京國民新聞駭人消息</h3>
<p>本期密勒氏評論週刊載有趣聞一則、云前駐滬日總領事河合、現充東京外務省情報局主任、近曾作滬游、其時適駐日英大使克萊琪與駐華英大使寇爾兩爵士在滬會談、華字報曾指河合挾巨款到滬、以資助反英運動、蓋日軍佔據各區內出版之報紙三十種、當時忽同作反英之宜傳也、但東京大報國民新聞尙載有更駭人聽聞之新聞一則、（見四月三十日該報）謂河合在滬受華友若干人大的乃服務上海「大道市府」者設宴款待、席閒發動人之演詞、力主中日兩國當在「東亞合作」、河合謂中日兩國欲求吿成此種「合作」、必須互抱赤裸裸之意志、該前總領事爲使人明白其竟義起見、當筵褫其衣服、而在華主人之前、作裸體跳舞」國民新聞又謂華人見之、深爲感動、河合因是益孚衆望（大道市府）云、</p>
<h3>經交涉後　德平釋放　明晚復航溫州　恩德由溫返滬</h3>
<p>意商中意公司之德平輸、自被日方扣留後、即經駐滬意領署提出交涉結果、始於本月十二日晚釋放、該輸定於明日晚（十五日）由滬開航溫州、又該公司之恩德輸複航滬溫綫後、該輪業已於咋晨由溫返滬、預定今日（十四日）下午抵滬、尙有被扣之高登·威金·天寶·等三輪、正由德領意領署當局分別進行交涉中、一俟交涉手續妥善、日內即可釋放、</p>
<h3>比籍記者由滬返日　突遭拘捕</h3>
<p>本埠外人接日本東京消息、有比國人士兩名、遭東京日警捕去、一名貝雁（譯音）年七十歲、爲巴黎某報記者、貝氏甫於四月二十日由上海返日、一爲柯雷爾（譯音）、年三十八歲、現任天主敎牧師、於兩日前被捕、據報吿被捕原因、係買賣貿易圖利、抵觸法令云、</p>
<h3>領團秘書朗氏　返美休假</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本埠領事團秘書朗氏、定六月初離滬返美、休假半載、頃已將秘書一職、移交意總領事署之巴埃、按朗氏來華服務、已逾二十年、任領事團秘書職、已閱十一年、巴挨來滬巳五載、首充意國某飛行公司代表、的三年前、改入駐滬意總領署、此决係意總領事薦舉、暫任領事團秘書職、半載後、朗氏返滬復職時、巴埃將仍在意總領事署服務、</p>
<h3>上海資金充沛　缺少運用對象　本年物價漲百分之十八　國際貿易出入口均减少</h3>
<p>——上海銀行之年會報吿——</p>
<p>上海商業儲蓄銀行年會時之民國二十七年之報吿云、本年度國內經濟狀况、因戰事之蔓延、遭受空前之厄運、損失之重、爲我國有史以來所未有、而各地經濟、因所受戰事影響之不同、更發生種種畸形現象、就大體而言、生產消費、均見衰退、至國外經濟狀况、各國因環境與政策之不同、其情况頗不一律、但不景氣之象徵、似較爲普遍、茲將國內經濟狀况、分金融·貿易·物價·及工商業·各項、撮述於左、</p>
<p>金融</p>
<p>本年度承去秋金融恐慌之後、財政部所頒安定金融辦法、繼續施行、中中交農所組織之貼放委員會、亦陸續在各地辦理貼放事宜、兼以政府對於法幣始終決心維持、同時英美友邦政府金融機關、亦輒相機協助、故戰局雖日趨惡化、而金融巿塲、迄能穩定如常、不特毫無提存風潮、即以前逃避之資金、亦有大量之回歸、金融機關、除一二小銀行外、無倒閉情事、全年上海拆息、並無異常之變動、即政府公價之暗市、亦盤旋上升、凡此均出我人預計之外、堪以引爲欣慰、在此比較穩定之局面下、其間亦不乏重耍事變、堪爲我人注意者、的有數端、</p>
<p>外滙黑巿</p>
<p>本年度開始、政府對於法定滙價、仍努力維持、嗣因環境關係、於三月十四日頒布外滙請核辦法、規定各銀行因正當用途於收付相抵後、需用外滙時、得向中央銀行申請購買、經中央銀行核准後、按照法定價售與外匯、俾對於外滙之供給、酌加限制、更於六月間絡續規定限制進口貨物之種類、對於出口貨物之外匯、亦應售於國家銀行、又於八月八日規定自本年度一月一日以後裝運進口之貨物、申請外滙、除必要品外、不再接受、市塲上外滙之需要、遂不能儘量滿足、所謂黑市塲、應運而生、法幣之非正式滙價、自一先令二便士半絡續下降、竟達八月閒之七便士八七五、但自下半年起、此項黑市塲之滙率、則常盤旋於八便士以上、英美借款成立後、允見堅穩、具見法幣之價値、雖在黑市塲操縱之下、猶能維持其相當穩定性也、</p>
<p>滙劃貼水</p>
<p>上海滙割貨幣、本定隔日取現、但自財部施行安定金融辦法以後、所謂同業滙劃、即爲祇能轉帳、不能兌現、並不能轉購外匯之貨幣、其用途旣受限制、如欲與現幣掉換、遂發生貼水辦法、此在上年度下半期已見端倪、本年度更變本加厲、嗣經聯合準備會出而維持、大量挹注、遂吿平復、至本年度底、則市上法幣籌碼、頗見增加、滙劃貼水、已趨低落、故自戰事發生以來、上海金融市塲、增加一種新籌碼、顧客與行莊往來、常須開立法幣與匯劃二戶、亦戰時金融之畸形現象也、</p>
<p>滙兌梗阻</p>
<p>本年度戰事逐漸西移、上海與內地之交通、日感不便、戰前及戰時上海運往內地貨物數量頗鉅、而內地土貨、不易大量運出、日爲政府所統制、自內地滙往上海之款項、遠過於上海滙往內地者、其匯兌率遂日趨高昂、且有無處調滙之苦、此外上海與華北各埠之滙兌、亦頗爲混亂、用是各地資金、不易互相挹注、則亦受戰事之影響也、</p>
<p>上海資金</p>
<p>自戰事離京滬一帶、內地人士避難來滬者、日見衆多、戰區資金、流入甚巨、而戰前及戰時購買外匯之資金、頗有因坐耗利息而獲利回歸者、用是上海資金、漸感充裕、金融業活期存款、增加頗巨、市塲籌碼、日趨鬆動、投機事業、隨以興起、自外幣赤金股票之買賣、以至各種商品之囤積、反較戰前爲繫盛、以資金運用於不生產之途徑、不能不視爲戰時經濟之隱憂、</p>
<p>西南金融</p>
<p>自政府西移後、西南之經濟開發、不容或緩、本埠各大金融機關爲適應內地人士之需要計、在西南各省重要地點、開設分支行者、日見衆多、戰區內之金融機關、亦多隨政府退至西南、人民資金、遂得逐漸移入、以供當地生產事業之用、目下上海之資金、旣缺少運用之對象、倘能在安全原則下、移用於內地、則有補於西南經濟開發者、當非淺鮮、凡此諸端、均爲本年度戰時金融之特徵、雖未盡如人意、然吾人茍體察此决戰事之嚴重、及其蔓延區域之廣大、不得不以本年度金融狀况之平穩、爲不可多得之現象、則政府之努力保障通貨、安定金融、及維誕債信、與夫友邦金融機關之協力相助、均具有莫大貢獻者也、（待讀）</p>

<h3>保衛我們的生命</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>——廈季是一切細菌大活躍的時期——</p>
<p>光陰迅駛，時代的巨輪向前飛跑，眼前已是綠了芭蕉，紅了石榴的夏天了！在這個夏天，我們的生命，是非常危險的，因為這個時期，是一切病原菌大活躍的時期，或者諸位還沒有忘記一切病原菌的「推銷員」——蚊蠅——它們是殺人的劊子手，所以對於保衛我們的生命，實在刻不稍緩了！還有一切病原菌的大本營——穢的地方，更非要設法肅淸不可，允其住在五方雜處的孤島上，今年又是人口增加到五六百萬，對於夏令的衛生，必須特別注意。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們大槪都知道，「病從口入」的一句話吧！我們最可寶貴的是什麼？就是我們的生命，那末，我們如何可以保衛自己的生命呢？唯有注意自己的衛生，換句話講，便是必須一切要淸潔。我們不論在衣服上，器具上，以及家裹的一切東西上，都要格外淸潔，如果有了積垢，一切病原菌立刻可以寄生在那東西上面，同時，不久很快地繁殖起來，——它們的子孫——，增加殺人的劊子手，擴大殺人的大本營，並且有大批的蚊蠅，乘機活躍，做它們的「推銷員」，於是我們時時刻刻有被細菌侵入的可能，這是極危險的事情！我們應該知道，槍砲是頂厲害的，但是我們看得見，也躱得及，當然可以臨時設法到安全地帶，而保存自已的生命，唯有這種病原菌，我們目光不能看見，所以也無從躲避。假定某一地方，發生了疫氣，便可以使週團數百里的人民，全部得病而致死，這並不是我來恐嚇你們，他的事實的確有如此可怕，我們說不定也生活在最可怕的疫氣（註）的氛圍中，現在却科學昌明，可以預先防範，——種牛痘，打防疫針——就是細菌前來進攻，也不會不抵抗而屈服，甚至死亡。個人死掉，固是可惜，如果大衆也如此，豈不更可惜更可怕嗎？有了健全的身體，才可以保衛自己的生命！</p>
<p>我們要保衛自己的生命，必須自已要講究衛生，像屋子裹的垃圾，耍天天打掃乾凈；台凳上的積垢，也耍天天揩去；吃的東西，允要不使蚊蠅吮吸，必須罩好，看見蚊蠅，要絕對加以撲滅；臭腐不潔的物品，不可隨便購買或吸食；生冷的東西，不可多吃；糖菓一類的東西，以不吃爲妙……總而言之，一切的一切，必須注意「清潔」兩字，我們個人的生命，得到了保障以後，推及一家人的生命也可保障，以至一個國家的全民族的生命都可保障。小朋友！你們是國家未來的主人翁，生命是何竿的重要，趕快從今天起，大家自己把家中的汚穢掃除乾凈，把蚊蠅肅淸撲滅，不但可以强身，還可以强國，大衆的生命也有保障了！「大兵之後，必有大疫」，我們切勿忘記呀！</p>
<p>（註）凡是霍亂，傷寒等一類的傳染病，總稱為疫氣。</p>
<h3>盲啞兒童在重慶</h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>在電慶的街上，每逢紀念日，總有一隊隊的宣傳隊在向老百姓演講，歌詠，其中最引人注意的却是一隊盲啞兒童。他們本來是「南京市盲啞學校」的學生，南京快要淪陷的時候，他們就和成千成萬的同胞一起，一步一步向西走，最後釗重慶來了。</p>
<p>在中日沒有打仗以前，全國盲啞學校總共有三十多人。有的是個人拿出錢來辦的，有的是敎會辦的。殘酷的戰事一發生，一齊都停辦，因為他們的校舍，敎具，都給毀滅了啊！只有南京市盲啞學校，能够繼續在軍慶開辦，它現在是全國僅存的盲啞學校了——像天亮後的孤星一樣。</p>
<p>這個學校在南京的時候，有二百個學生。在日機天天轟炸之下，還照常的上課，直到那年（二十六年底）因為形勢愈加緊急了，才奉到政府命令，停課向西撤退。但是因為缺乏交通工具，大部份的敎職員與學生來不及退出南京，只有其中六十人，平安地到了漢口，南京一失，這個學校的全部校舍，裏面有縫衣廠，印刷廠，照相室，排字房，藤器製造室，還有許多讀，寫，算的課本，各種各式的敎具，都無情地給破壞了。</p>
<p>在戰前，畢業生都能找到職業。盲者大部份做了敎師，音樂家，啞者大部份做了書店，公司，銀行的職員。中英庚款管理委員會曾經允許這個學校，撥出十萬塊銀，作為建築新校舍之用。中國防盲協會的主席蔣宋美齡女士也答應從這個學校裏選出兩個盲童，到美國去留學。但是，這許多事，小朋友們—中國抗戰的結果，是勝利？是失敗？還是和平？請你走走看！</p>
<p>（倪長民製）（義賣獻金）都因戰爭而停頓了。</p>
<p>二十七年六月，這個學校遷釗重慶，繼續開學。現在共有學生六十多人，分作兩班，一班是盲童，一班是啞童。程度是由小學到初中，高中，課程有國語，算術，英文，音樂，歷史，自然，……等等。他們現正打算開一職業班，附設工廠，使學生能得到職業上的訓練。</p>
<p>他們的童子軍，目前正做着種種救國工作：演講，歌詠，勸募救國捐。去年除夕，這一羣盲啞的演講家，音樂家，會在中央廣播電臺作過廣播。</p>
<p>如果你在重慶街顛，看到一羣不能說話的啞少年，領了他們盲目的同伴，一路走去，到了相當地點，就由盲少年們站起來，向羣衆宣傳救國，你會如何感動啊！</p>
<p>小朋友們—中國抗戰的結果，是勝利？是失敗？還是和平？請你走走看！（義賣獻金）</p>

<h3>進餐</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>——明兒避難記之二十——</p>
<p>在嚴州宿了一晚，到得明兒從睡夢中醒來，那知天巳亮了，好一會兒，太陽也高高地發出了强烈的光芒，可是在船頭和船梢上却都不見船夫們的踪跡，靜悄得一無動靜，原來他們昨晚睡在那艘大船上的。因此江山船依然沉默地停歇在船堆中，而在船艙裏的逃難人却巳開始活動了，洗臉的洗臉，漱口的漱口，在幹着早晨必須幹的工作，到得他們一切都幹完了，那輩船夫們才姍姍而來，於是船也開始向前移動了。</p>
<p>在前幾天，天還沒有亮淸，你們便開船了，而今天，這樣遲才開。船老大，是不是昨晚睡得太舒服的緣故吧？一明兒帶着半責備半玩笑的語調，向呆立在船頭，而面對着他故鄕的船老大問着。他經明兒這樣的一說，便提醒了他，就笑了一笑的撐着竹篙。「他對於家鄕竟有這樣的戀戀不捨。」明兒贈自的說着。這時他聽得艙中吃早餐的聲音，便一溜烟的走進去了。</p>
<p>不知怎的，明兒自到了江山船上，是特別的吃得下飯，在平時，三輩三素可口的小菜，他還厭這不好吃，那不爽口，吃了一碗飯，便放下了筷走了。那知現在竟大不相同，一口氣差不多要吃上三碗，有時還要添一兩口，而且在船上的小菜，不會高妙的，因為菜耍自已辦的，害得明兒母親每逢到了一個小鎮，便先問船夫這鎮上有沒有葷素小菜買的，如果有的話，伊老人家總不辭辛苦的到岸上去採辦一些，預備吃它二三天，於是每一碗菜要放上二三天之久，味兒不過如此了。可是明兒倒不厭它的味道怎樣，他的食量有增無减，不但他是有這現象，恐怕在艙中的每個人也都是這樣，這不是很奇怪的事情麼？但這很容易解釋的，因為在平時，他們大都是勞心，現在整天的生活，不是吃便睡，不是望野景即是談天，比較是少用腦力，當然是比以前吃得多了。</p>
<p>在一角狹狹的床鋪上，揭去了被單，把一二碗隔宿的菜，放在床沿邊，明兒父親拿了一個包裏墊在底下當作凳子。母親坐在床沿，明兒自己去盛了一碗滿滿的粥，拿了一雙竹筷，當他把菜箝上碗去的時候，粥湯從碗口鋪出來，一滴滴的染在被上。</p>
<p>「為什麼你這樣的狼形，盛得可以淺一些，吃完了再添，不是一樣的嗎？」他的母親這樣說。</p>
<p>「因為我吃得很慢，粥不是要被你們盛完了麼？因此我非要盛得多一些不可。」這幾句獃的話，引得全船的人都笑了起來。明兒邊說邊走到鋪蓋旁邊坐了下來。他兩隻眼睛射在飯碗裏，一陣子的把筷將粥往嘴裏送，這時只覺得甜而香的粥和好吃的菜，也不及細細的去嘗了。他等到粥一送到嘴裏，便把舌頭向喉嚨邊一推，喉嚨的肌肉一縮，粥便一滾兒的倒下去了，喉間有些熱辣辣，別的也不覺得什麼。這樣狼吞虎嚥般很快的吃完了一碗，一陣「霍落，霍落」的吃粥聲，恐怕在全船中，明兒的聲音，要算手屈一指了。他吃了一碗叉一碗，還要想去添，那知鍋底朝天，他不得不放下了碗而能手，靜待着吃午飯的機會了</p>
<p>船夫們背了一小時左右的　，便收着繩，回到船上來吃飯了，明兒也隨着他們到船梢上。他們早上是吃飯的，祇有一碗靑菜放在船板上，每個船夫拿了一大碗的飯，很爽口的嚥下肚去，明兒眼見得他們吃得這樣可口，竟不免把自己的唾液咽了幾口，他不再看了，回到了船頭，後來明兒知道他們每天要吃五頓，這也怪不得，因為他們每天差不多要走上五六十里的路。</p>
<p>「哥哥，你看，他們只吃一碗菜，而飯是吃得很多，所以身體也是很强健。那麼我這幾天來，飯量不算少，我的身體大槪也會像他們吧？」明兒打着趣問着正在看書的哥哥——聰兒。</p>
<h3>美國小朋友的　中國遊記</h3>
<p>— 新生</p>
<p>我在某年的叫月，應中國小朋友華兒之遙，來作中國之遊：當總統號汽船（一）駛遠長江口外的神灘時，我就看到巨大的建設號挖泥船（二），據說它在世界上大挖泥船中佔着第二位。到了上海（三）那國際飯店等建築物，很有些像紐約市的風光，沿海一帶的水產物（四）大半在這兒集散；由（三）先到杭州（五），遊了那全球聞名的西湖後，到南京去謁中山陵（六）然後，坐了火車北上，和這津沛鐵路（七）有時並行而有時卻是交乂的是一條用人工開通的大運河（八），火車經山東省而達天津（九）山東半島的水菓（十）產量極豐，自（九）至北平，遊了故宮，天壇（一一）等處，再去看那十一孔的長石橋—蘆溝橋（一二），憑弔那亘延二千里，盤繞於萬山叢間的長城（一三）而後出關至東三省，這兒大豆（一四）的產量很多，可說是它的第一富源，礦產以煤，鐵為最富，金的產量亦多（一五），森林（一六）又是中國最茂盛的地方，森林旣盛，野獸即因而孳生，因此這兒毛皮（一七）的出產亦極多，由東三省經內蒙到外蒙，蒙古地方所給予我的印像並不是戈壁沙漠的壞，那羊，馬，牛，駱駝（一八，一九）為數千萬，成羣結隊放牧在水草地帶間，很是偉觀！那些蒙古人大都是居住在用牛皮製成的蒙古包（二〇）中的，騎術很精熟，放鷹行獵（二一）一術允能引起我的興趣！由蒙古到著名的羊毛出產地寗夏（二二），然後再經埋藏有鉅量煤油的延長（二三）入豫，火車經過那三千米長的黃河鐵橋（二四）而達漢口（二五），著名的漢陽鐵廠，就在漢口的對面；由（二五）乘船（二六）西行，經過洞庭湖（二七）口，這是產米（二八）很富的兩湖流域中之一大湖，船經三峽（二九）溯江上駛達重慶（三〇），這是中國戰後的新都，由（三〇）我乘了飛機（三一）去西北，先經蘭州（三二），那兒是中國道路的經緯中心點，名產是皮絲烟，再至哈密（三三），這兒的瓜非常出名，萍果，梨，葡萄等物終年不斷，此外我還看到和圍的玉器（三四）；新疆南部和靑海，西藏產着犛牛（三五）這牛的乳，肉供食，糞作燃料，是一種很有用的家畜，它的頭部好像黃牛身披長毛，尾巴像馬，而它的呌聲卻像豬！西藏還產一種白熊（三六）很是珍貴，我國紐的動物園中也蓄着兩顛呢！西藏高原的南端是世界的屋脊—喜瑪拉雅山（三七）高原上的住屋平而方，好像碉樓（三八）；我在靑海（三九）看到一種魚，體面沒有鱗片，所以呌做無鱗魚，游歷西康的時候，我曾從那懸在急流上面的索橋（四〇）上走過，西康的鸚鵡（四一）多而好玩。成都湓地的水車（四二）形扁圓而大，這是舊法的應用水力，此外四川所產的藥材（四三）數量很多。由重慶經公路至貴陽（四四）我在那兒曾看到苗族的舞蹈，非常的好看，到了昆明（四五）後我休息幾天，雲南的鑛產以銅錫（四六）為最著。我後來又回經貴陽而至桂林遊覽當地的山水名勝（四七），由那兄我經水路至廣州，廣州是中國革命的發源地，南方大港，著名的建築如：黃花崗革命烈士墓，珠江大橋和能容萬人的中山紀念堂（四八）我都去觀光過，廣東省的出產有海南島的椰子（四九），汕頭的橘子，甘蔗（五〇）均甚著名。我遊罷後，和華兒小朋友握別於南海之濱，自香港乘飛艇啟程，橫渡太平洋回國。我這番遊歷的結果，所得的感想乃是：「中國有廣大的土地，鉅量的寶藏，用不盡的人力，若是他能應用他們來建設，日後一定可以變成一個很强盛的國家呢！」</p>
<p>小朋友：你讀了這篇假設的美國小朋友的中國遊記後，心中有些什麼感想？</p>
<p>「你要知道他們身體的强健，一大半是運動的關係。像你只吃不運動，身體也會長得胖胖的，不過身上的肉是猪身上的肥肉，不是肌肉，那你身上多了肥肉，預備賣給陸稿薦去燒醬猪肉嗎？」聽兒頑皮的回答着，於是又引起船艙中的笑聲。</p>
<h3>翻筋斗</h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>翻筋斗也是一種有益的運動，諸位很可以去試試看。不過我所說的翻筋斗不是呌你像馬戲班裏一樣的在空中翻，而呌你在床裏或軟墊上翻</p>
<p>翻筋斗的姿勢是把身體屈曲成球形，所以翻的時候頂要緊的就是屈曲身體，吾則就容易倒痛。翻筋斗的原動力有兩個，一個是在兩脚，一個是在頭部，支點有一個，就在兩手。簡明地說，就是翻筋斗的時候，身體屈曲，兩手着地，當做支點；頭向下鑽，脚向下蹴，一個筋斗就給你翻成功了。</p>
<p>翻筋斗並不是胡鬧，却是很高尙很有益的一種運動，不過你要慢慢地學，如果慢慢地練，你太用力，倒得頭昏眼花，那就對你有害了。</p>
<p>在普通各種健身操中，頭的位置放在心臟下面的，確是很少。翻筋斗的特點就在這裹。有許多人把頭的位置放到心臟下面，往往會漲紅面孔，頭暈眼花，這因為你頭部血管不健全的綠故。假使你時常做這一類的運動，頭部的血管就可以健全起來。</p>
<p>頭部血管健全不健全，不是空口講講的東西，在日常生活上對你很有用處，譬如乘輪船，趁火車，你沒有健全的頭部血管，便會覺得頭暈，就是所謂「暈船」，「暈軍」，如果坐飛機，那顚簸更是利害。諸位將來坐輪船，坐飛機的機會總不會少的，如果現在把翻筋斗時常練習，對你是很有裨益的</p>
<p>如果你輕輕的翻，就覺得頭暈，這是體格上的關係，你可以按步就班的練習下去，將來就可以不暈了。因為碰撞所致的頭暈才有害處，輕翻所致的頭暈是不耍緊的。</p>
<p>來函　編輯先生：我們拙陋的稿子，先生巷我們登出來了，很是榮幸，現在看到報上義賣的稿件很多，我們雖是小學生，但是救國的熱忱，不敢後人，情願拿我們已經在實刊上登出的二件稿費，也作為義賣獻金，（一黑貓和花貓，二，鞦韆的自述）以後來的稿件，還望先生替我們改正，祝你筆健，震東小學學生祁進梅張祖德啟上，五月四日。</p>
<h3>畜生道中（一）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>彭其是一個壞孩子。他原名彭其明，但是大家都喚他彭其，分明是蟚琪的諧音。他的臉上，常常是不清不白的，好像蒙着一重雲霧，又像是一塊黑板沒有揩抹乾淨的樣子。有人說因為他學上洗臉不曾周到的緣故。</p>
<p>小孩子本來是良好的，說不上壞不壞。即使頑皮一些，這也是常有的事，只要忍耐到他們長大成人之後，也就不頑皮了。要是一個孩子，聰明伶俐，小時節就不頑皮，那自然好像是一件寳貝，最能討人歡喜了。</p>
<p>小孩子們天性喜歡收集，一面喜歡破壞，所以他們的小房間，仿佛一個竹頭木屑破銅爛鐵以及零星百貨的棧房，有的東西似乎完全沒用，而有時却又十分合用的。譬如你要一根銅絲或電綫，或是花盆破了，鳥籠壞了，還有什麽日用東西的柄斷了，要尋那同樣質地的東西來修補時，只須到小孩子們的房間去找時，總能找到的。這其間的東西，眞和百貨公司一樣複雜，一段洋臘，一塊積木，或一隻裝水彩畫類料的空匣子，什麽都有。彭其的房間，也當然如此，不過大間小異罷了。</p>
<p>還有小孩子們的遊戲，也種種不一，除了一部份正當而有益的遊戲以外，有的簡直是近於惡作劇了。一般男孩子，往往踢打獸畜，作弄較小的孩子，嘲笑婦女，集合了一般志同道合的小朋友，共同做這些玩意，以為是非常有趣的。彭其就是其中之一，允其喜歡結交那些下流的劣孩，整日的在一起胡鬧。瞧他自已的模樣兒，實在並不下流，要是把熱水和肥皂來擦抹一下，就一個小公子了。</p>
<p>彭其最壞的脾氣，就是喜歡虐待獸畜。他並不是無心的虐待，也不是當作一種遊戲，也不是因為他偶因心中不快而借此發洩。他實在是以為虐待別的東西，而瞧它們苦痛，是一件最快樂的事，分明是生就了這種殘忍的天性，再也沒法改變的了。</p>
<p>彭其有兩個妹妹，都比他年幼，他一向很輕視伊們的。伊們倆是一對又美麗又溫柔小東西，別的孩子們喜歡和伊們同在一起玩耍的，尤其是在學校中放假的日子，閒着沒有事做，得了伊們倆作伴，就一些兒不覺寂寞了。可是彭其專喜和下流的劣孩結交，當然不會把兩個妹妹放在眼裡。他以為球戲等一切運動，都是沒有意識的，他家裏的花園，當他在學校裏讀書的時候，雖由他的兩位妹妹收拾得很好，但他也從不曾動過手，種過一花一草。至於讀書寫字，研究自然課等，全都不放在心上的。</p>
<h3>母愛（二）</h3>
<p>— 特也</p>
<p>巨里安：您該讓……讓我們去，媽媽。媽媽：是你！李佳德，也不能去！你可想得到我的心裏就是對於你，是怎樣？稀開着嘴唇，睡在我旁邊，他的呼吸聲當在我耳旁的那個人，我知道他連身體上跟靈魂上的快樂，都是屬於我的。</p>
<p>爸爸：我愛，這是很久前的事啦。……</p>
<p>媽媽：不，李佳德，一切都在眼前啦；就像你，安德萊，時常嘴裏咕嚕着，沒有一刻安穩，是個洶氣的小孩子，瞼上却怪聰明的，不像那麼大歲數。我帶着你在園子裏走着，把手搭在你的肩上，像靠着你似的。你呢，喬治，還是時常爬樹，你記得我每天晚上總用碘酒搽在你無數擦破的皮膚上麼？</p>
<p>巨里安：談這些話有什麼益處？媽媽這些無味……」</p>
<p>媽媽：什麼呌益處？你知道這正是像我所不能懂得的。這些無味話，我覺得句句比你們打仗似乎要緊得多哩。那些瑣些事情，在我看來，算得盤個世界。你們自從有了一知半解的那天，在言談的神情上，便全溜出了我的手掌中了。為什麼？為什麼？自古到今，總是做母親的女人，為了你們好好地成人，費盡了一生心血。</p>
<p>祖父：別為他們生氣，媳婦。</p>
<p>媽媽：我不為他們生氣，公公，我氣的是這個世界，牠使我把我的孩子一個個送到死地上去，為了一點撈什子光榮。世界可會因此變好一點兒麼？這是不是有益嗎？公公，請您說吧。</p>
<p>祖父：當然有益的呀！過去的大事，件件都有關係你也免不了的。</p>
<p>爸爸：我知道，我的最親愛的，這是使你心疼，我來看看你，有話跟你說。</p>
<p>媽媽：不必看我，李佳德！你也不必，孩于也不必，我在緊急時候也能使人害怕的。</p>
<p>爸爸……你，你也能！我愛，在必要時慷慨就死麼？</p>

<h3>美棉補空近期獨漲　大批印棉明日抵埠</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日殊爲呆滯，晨初開盤因交易靜寂、市價跌三五磅音、中途雖因利物浦及印度來電漲價而略呈堅挺之狀、現貨市上存底不厚、五月份多頭收貨者預料最多、空戶慘痛補進、因之五月份獨漲十一磅音、遠期均跌二三磅音、印度異常挺秀、昨日連同預測又漲一羅比、但昨晚接得印度來電、開盤又漲二羅比、埃及漲三五磅音、折合法幣、計美棉及巴西棉每担跌二角、印棉漲四角、埃及漲五角、</p>

<p>中國棉生意之沉寂、爲歷來所罕見、竟無市可報、完全停滯、同業及廠方一包未曾成交、大概貨物匱乏、執貨者居奇尤烈、以致雙方談判難以接近、惟外棉換算價平靜、各方一律購訂、中國棉前途之慘淡、殊堪憂慮也、蘇北來源亦受種種牽制、到貨微薄、僅五十七包云、</p>

<p>倫敦本星期開世界食糖產銷會議、前數日消方提案要求、古巴（產地）增加出口額二十萬噸、供給自由市塲、致投機者傾售、今聞此從案未獲通過、故倫敦糖市塲頓見反動轉漲、昨電八月份漲四便士二五、為七先令五便士三五、遠期十二月份漲三便士七五、為六先令五便士、明年三月份漲三便士七五、為六先令六便士、致公會劃盤市勢突緊、現貨二四粗白本棧貨二十七兀七角、外棧貨二十七元五角、較升六角、轉口貨先市十九元四角、成交一千包、後升呌十九元六角、成交二百包、太古糖亦帶漲、B嘜先二十七元三角半、成交二百包、後二十七元四角、成交四百包、CW為二十七元三角、CX二十七元、DY二十六元八角、HX二十六元七角、惟港電無更動、國糖市勢亦提、卽有潮帮開出足三尖白糖一百餘包、價為二十五元五角至四角、昨日有糖一百十五包、由香港來滬、又三千八百四十包、由汕頭裝來、</p>

<p>本埠絲市、買賣兩方、在靜待發展、目下情形、尙非互相僵持、洋行廠商、日有接洽、但因雙方價格相距達三十元許、故未有交易、印非莊口、昨同吿淸淡、然絲價亦無下回趨勢、蓋目前情形、存絲存繭有限、絲廠夜工巳相率停開、而收繭與新土絲運滬辦法、迄未解決、致新絲交易、遲遲不能拋開、而遠期絲價、亦日趨上游、湖絲二百二十二件、絲頭四十六件及茶葉一千三百十箱、均於前日（十二日）運往歐洲、</p>

<h3>粮食　米價暗盤迭出　常帮粳開至十六元五角　客秈現價已易中次充數</h3>
<p>杜米　昨日各帮來源、河下未到、車輪包子祇一千餘包、到源日稀、聞因內地糙價飛漲、搬運不通及被阻所致、市塲情形更覺混亂、暗盤百出、已成公開秘密、聞得常粳已開十六元半、錫粳開十六元三角、蘇同粳開十五兀七角至十六元出零、薄稻若泗涇貨亦巳開至十五元七角至十六兀、為薄粳保守限綫者亦有、然大都為宿决之貨、故此種歧形、似乎辜負米業公會限價一片苦心、至於客尖高貨仍充、如砶米已開十三元八角半、較漲三四角、洋杜尖市上未見、變元價格旣高、更受洋糯相軋、仍守原盤、香港糯開十九元八角至十九元半、總之此種岐形、各貨身本其中較重者、雖屬不乏、然廉價之貨亦頗非鮮、故不分皂白、一味暗盤、似未免有操縱之嫌、故深望負責當局以民食為重、再施補救之道、其如疏通來源乎、</p>
<p>客秈　昨被粳尖暗盤高價所激動、形勢更已緊張、而蕪湖產地情形不明、貨方允圖扳佾擯守、車輪來源見减、高蕪秈市上有十四元四五角暗盤之傳說、京秈十四元七角至四角、但均無法證明、市上正式買開十四元至十三元七角之蕪秈、乃易為中决檔貨、砶米亦至十三元七角、糙米十二元六七角、較之前日又漲二三四角不等、洋米定貨雖無證實、然有接近之可能、故西貢零售仍祇十九元外、洋元米續有辦到、但高洋元亦須十九元八角至五角、昨日進口有米一千一百三十包由香港來、</p>
<h3>日商續辦本麥　澳麥三船陸續到　麵粉平疲一如故</h3>
<p>粉市平疲如故、北洋帮仍以當地洋粉傾軋、天津粉市報小、販運難以通劃、教進胃呆滯、南洋帮則以存粉已有裝出、新交易略形活動、但為數有限、各廠鑒於客銷旣難活躍、故猶維持原盤、不願遽鬆、統市成交總額、不足三萬包、由本街及內地帮的去半數、其餘則為客帮辦去、</p>
<p>小麥來源、近日長江內地一帶之貨絡繹有到、値此洋麥定貨湧到之際、各廠進胃呆滯、僅恃日商採取、市面尙不過疲、吾則一兀大關、尙難站住耳、昨聞日商暗中續辦江北及常錫等麥共二千包許、價為六元五角至四角半、市傳該麥亦係轉運華北粉廠製粉之用、至本埠粉廠吃盤、即六元三角、尙嫌價昂云、</p>
<p>洋麥大批接踵而來、前報所載之英商保和洋行、經理之Llandaff號輪、由澳洲載麥來滬、原定十四日到埠、茲據該公司云、已提前於前日（十二日）抵滬、共運來麥子八千一百噸、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、又有大英公司之Trehata號、亦由澳運麥八千零七十六噸來滬、巳於昨日進口、暫泊十二號浮筒、定今日改靠華豐廠碼頭過駁、又怡和洋行經理之Ridley號、亦裝來澳麥八千噸，的本月十八日可抵滬、</p>

<h3>「人超數字」驚人</h3>
<p>— 流風</p>
<p>前日本報本埠新聞載有「滬關貿易雖漸恢復，入超數字驚人」的新聞一則，副標題兩行曰：「政府努力消除入超之際，此全滬人士所應慚悔者。」的確，上海的「入超數字」的驚人，是我們住居在上海的五百萬通報，特別市有產者的同胞們所應「慚悔」的！</p>
<p>上海是已不僅為我們中國的政治經濟的重心之地，（現在當然已失却她得重要性了，然而無疑的，她還有　多多少少的　用處·）同時，也是成為國際間的一個重要的都會了·人們歡喜把「東方的巴黎」來形容這成為都會年紀還輕的上海，由這也可見上海的「巴黎化」，是一塊多麼奢侈淫靡的罪惡之地了！這樣的「東方的巴黎」，又配上她的「東方的運命」，她的年年增高的「入超數字」原也是不足為奇，更無由令人驚訝的地方了！</p>
<p>然而，「東方的運命」不是「一成不變」的，套在她頸項間的枷鎖究竟是窒息著她的氣管的。跟著「睡獅」的猛然醒來的憤怒一吼，這「東方的巴黎」使曾有過一時被人認為要「毀滅」了得。人們使對著這「東方的巴黎」惴惴不安起來，雖然有著她的忠誠的兒女們在保護她，然而酒精也有人從她這裡逃避了去的。</p>
<p>像夢一樣的，不久，這「東方的巴黎」使又回復了她昔日的光彩了。人們忘記了心頭上的創傷，才不久對著這「東方的巴黎」抱著惴惴不安的心理，現在時改變成為「上海究竟是塊福地」的一種快樂的呼叫了！他們忘掉上海市在整個「東方的運命」的急激轉變中德不可避免的轉變過程中，她們似乎也忘掉上海是陷在四面的恐怖之中，不時來威脅著人們。忘了，一切都忘了，在上海跟著「東方的運命」的急激轉變中，還忍心表現出一種「巴黎化的姿態」。因此，今年第一季的入超為四千七百五十七萬八千元，較去年同季之一千九百十萬零七千元，竟增加二千八百四十七萬一千元。因為海關的易幟，所以進口貨中，那種貨物占其多數，是不問而知的了！</p>
<p>這不是上海人應「慚悔」的是什麽？然而這「慚悔」還是應該讓有產者來擔任的，因為窮苦的同胞在上海，就單只「住」的問題已經夠他們「一日百歎」了，還有什麽餘力來買他們所要而不能得之的「貨物」呢？因此問題還是要希望有錢的朋友們多多「節約」才是！如果要問「爲什麽」？那末回答使很簡單；「救了國家，也就是救了你自己和你的子孫！」　（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　椎髻青裙賢良有母　銀髯翠袖矍鑠是翁</p>
<p>且說自由村的朱村長，設立了很多的補習學校，教人去補習。不論是男是女，便是年紀大寫的，也沒有關係。尤其是在冬天，因為到了冬天，農家也有空閒一點了。自由村還造了一個會堂，這個會堂，有好幾種用處。自由村有什麽開會的事，召集村人會議，當然在這個會堂內。譬如來了一位名人，朱村長要請他演講，也在這個會堂內。再者，有什麽公共的慶祝會，紀念會，往往也都在這會堂內。那個自由村小學校，也就在這個會堂隔壁。這樣一個新村，又由朱老源那樣一位大家知道的人，在那裡提倡，不難使這個自由村，日臻繁盛。但朱村長却是一位樸素的人，別個鄉鎮上，日事繁華，各種娛樂的事也都有了。自由村却連一個電影院也沒有，倘然難得有演劇隊，或是電影教育團，巡迴到這裡時，大半也是在這個會堂里演出。公園倒有一處，而且地方也很大，不過公園裡房子却很少，草地很廣闊，還有一片種植場，使兒童們對於各種植物，都能認識。朱村長自己所住的地方，離小學校不遠，只有三間平房，那房子完全是鄉村格式，像是草堂模樣。門前使一片場地，周圍使編的竹籬，兩扇矮矮的門。進門倒有一架葡萄棚，取其夏日陰涼。朱村長到了夏天，在晚涼時候，移了一張竹榻，在葡萄棚下，跣足坦胸，箕坐乘涼。或者約了幾位老朋友，在那裡談今道古。他別的一無嗜好，就是興來時，偶然喜歡喝三杯酒。那酒並不是什麽高價的酒，不用說外國的什麽白蘭地威士克了，就是中國有名出產的酒，他也不需要。他只是家釀的所謂杜做酒，他的那位媳婦大娘子，可以自己做得，常常做好了孝敬那位阿翁，以供他不時之需。在他所住的草堂後面，也有一片場地，對他的草堂向陽建築了一所樓房，這樓房使一並排三間，造得也並不考究。現在那位朱太太，便是朱愛人的母親，就住在那裡。朱村長覺得自己並不需要住那種樓房，而且他也住不慣樓房的，這屋子預備給他的孫女兒住得。他以為孫女是外國回來的，外國人喜歡住樓房，將這樓房，供給孫女居住。（一〇九）</p>
<h3>肉市</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>利害二字，原是相對的，從某一觀點商看，使認為有害的，但是從另一觀點上看，則認為有利的，這樣情形，例難枚舉。</p>
<p>豬肉市場發生問題后，過屠門大嚼之輩，不得大嚼，未免垂涎三尺，大有「食無肉」之歎。但是上海平時，每天豬肉消食數量，本有五六千頭之多，至戰後已減去其半，近則每天祗到二三十頭，故自今日起，兩租界宰牲公司，停止宰豬。這事若照畜牲觀點上說來，惟有這種豬　　自應該感激涕零的。</p>
<h3>處女的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>Yes，My　darling　danghcgr</p>
<p>華納公司出品　國泰大劇院映</p>
<p>「處女的苦悶」是一部可以一看的喜劇，但做廣告的朋友却把它歪曲了，這歪曲不論是故意的爲了「生意眼」，或是由於譯名爾激起潛意識的流露，都將削弱這片子本身的價值。</p>
<p>導演者威廉凱萊使我們熟悉的人物，他的「巨人谷」「羅賓漢」不都給我們很好的印象嗎？不久之前，他又借了夫人琪尼薇托萍（就是在戲裡飾康妮的那位）來過上海，華納公司的上海辦事處並且假國際飯店為他舉行了一次茶會。</p>
<p>不過他過去的作品，大部份都屬於所謂「硬性」影片，像「處女的苦悶」那樣輕鬆的喜劇，則是少見的。使能者無所不能吧！威廉的處理這部戲，成績也並不在過去的幾部所謂「硬性影片」之下：雋永風趣，活潑爾不胡鬧。</p>
<p>「處女的苦悶」的故事，是很簡單的：一個生活富裕的雜誌編輯，應了一聲的勸告到鄉村去作週末旅行，呼吸一點新鮮的空氣，可是結果他却沒有得到安靜的休息，他的那位朋友的女兒，正和一個學建築的青年詩人有了一點小小的誤會（因為那位詩人窮得沒有錢去參加她的畢業禮），等誤會冰釋的時候，那位青年爲了他的自立，要暫時離開她兩年，等功成名就再回來；為了這，她決心和他回到鄉村小墅中區歡聚兩天，可是她的行動却受到了干涉，經她的力爭和她祖母的幫助，終算如願以償沒，爾最後，　家因為他倆相愛的堅決和光明，遂成全其好事。</p>
<p>這故事自然是美國式的，離我們此時此地的血腥的中國，使太遠了；可是，在我們這個半封建社會里，後一代爲了爭取他們的戀愛自由，——自主的區找他們畢生幸福維繫的伴侶，這在反封建這一點看來，是有著它的價值的。「當你和我一樣年齡的時候，你願意受到別人的干涉嗎？」（大意如此）愛蓮的指紋把那個女小說家母親問住了。</p>
<p>子女使應該有著他自己的自由的，——這也就是說，子女該是父母的私產。</p>
<p>導演的手法非常高超，這樣對白繁重，手法非常高超，被處理得如此的輕盈活潑，喜劇空氣非常濃郁，那真不是一件容易的事情。所以有如此成就者，各個脚色的性格都寫成為活生生的人物是其一，剪接的明朗緊湊也是其一，爾各個演員的搭配齊整，更是一個原因。在這個戲裡，我們簡直很難分別得出誰是主角來。爾因為這樣，這個戲才成功了。</p>
<p>如果一個戲一定要找出一個主角來，那麼，依我看來，這個戲的主角應該是飾老祖母葛雷妮的梅勞勃蓀，爾不是飾愛蓮的潘麗茜拉蘭。潘麗茜拉蘭自然演得不壞，尤其是開場中和陶格拉斯吵嘴的那場戲里，很顯出她可以演一個現代的美國女性，敏捷矯健爾不是口紅滿嘴的人物，和奧沙莉文等比起來，她是更年青更可愛的，其他的脚色呢？我不想多開流水帳，我想告訴你一句話就夠了：這個戲是很難說誰是主角誰是配角的。</p>

<h3>（一）物質生活的改造</h3>
<p>— 俞</p>
<p>唯物主義者總是堅持著物質萬能的主張，否定物質以外一切的力量。可是當他遭遇了莫大的痛苦，或心裡感覺到非物質力量所能增補之時，也許他就要體會到超物質的一種安慰的需要。這種超物質的事物便是人類的精神。</p>
<p>今日我們的國家，正遭逢罕有的危機，存亡榮辱均繫於國人的精神如何，爾不全在於武力的厚薄。我們要一致奮起，改正醉生夢死，自暴自棄的生活，發揮至大至剛得精神力量，來完成我們這一種繼往開來千載一時的使命。</p>
<p>親愛的同胞們，特別市住在上海的我們，曾否反省一下現有的生活？我們是否能注意到物質方面的享受，爾疏忽了淨勝的充實。我們是否依舊沉湎於酒色煙賭的壓落生活，爾忘却對國家對民族的重大責任。若果這樣，我們就該立即改造我們的生活，使其嚴肅起來，以免意志頹唐，精神渙散，影響個人和國家的前途。</p>
<p>不過我們深信我們要改造生活，在道德與信仰上，我們還需要有一種幫助。耶穌基督便是我們的良友，道士，救主。它會援引我們，洗淨我們的罪行，而且給予我們改造生活的力量，它是人類唯一的救贖者，凡信它的不至滅亡，反得永生。</p>

<h3>攝製新片「獨裁者」　卓別麟接獲大批恐嚇信</h3>
<p>— （舒芒）</p>
<p>雇用特別衛士輪流保護　決不動搖初衷努力進行</p>
<p>銀幕喜劇巨匠卓別麟的開口新片「獨裁者」，內容誰都知道是諷刺某獨裁者的，他把目前世界政局中的某種野蠻與不合理的政治現象，強調了牠底愚蠢性與可笑性，以喜劇的形勢搬上銀幕，在全世界的觀眾之前給以無情的打擊。這當然會使被諷刺的某一種人感到憤怒與威脅的，因之向卓別麟使出了他們一貫的無賴手段——恐嚇——謀害。</p>
<p>「獨裁者」已經開拍了，目前正在積極的攝製中，可是自從這張片子決定開拍以後，卓別麟先後接到了無數的恐嚇信，內容大都是說「獨裁者」一片含有「悔蔑」意味，迫令立即停止攝製，否則將以恐怖手段，把卓氏「置之死地」云云。卓別麟為防止遭人毒手起見，最近已雇用了一個貼身的武裝衛士，盡夜保護。他的一日三餐，在烹調的時候，並派了特別偵探在旁監視，以防奸人下毒謀害。同時，在攝製該片的時候，攝影場四周也有戒備，情況相當嚴重。但據說卓別麟雖然受了暴徒的恐嚇的威脅，他的初衷決無絲毫動搖；反之，「獨裁者」的攝製工作，目前正積極加緊努力，日夜進行，以期在最短其間，「此可笑之喜劇，得呈於全世界開明人士之前」，按好萊塢影人受到這樣嚴重的戒備，仿佛政界要人那樣，在電影史上尚屬創見。</p>
<p>劇壇外史</p>
<h3>新演劇團　排演「阿Q正傳」</h3>
<p>上海劇壇看上去好像相當冷寂，除了學校劇壇偶爾公演以外，上海劇藝社也祗是在新光大戲院演星期早場，大規模的演出，春季劇壇上還沒有看見過。</p>
<p>而實際，上海劇壇卻在流著激動的「低潮」，道「低潮」也許就在眼前，曾激成「高潮」吧。</p>
<p>這「高潮」也證實我現在要報告的，就是以前在青島劇社的徐卜夫等，新組織了一個新演劇團，團員計有張婉，蔡瑾，沈菱等。</p>
<p>這雖然是新生的劇團，而且外面也很少透露出什麽消息，但實際他們卻在埋頭苦幹，連日在福煦路團址裏，排演魯迅先生的「阿Q正傳」，這，你想是一個多麼偉大的計劃呵。</p>
<p>在上海「阿Q」還沒有演出過，以前「中旅」想演，結果被炮火打毀了，現在新演劇團第一炮就演「阿Q正傳」，道不得不佩服他們的大膽。</p>
<p>主演「阿Q」這一角色的，是沈菱，他是中法劇藝學校的學生，二負責全劇導演的，你們猜猜看是誰？就是在香港大公報寫過數萬言「上海劇壇低潮」的旅圖·（也即使蕭　）這位先生導演的劇還沒有看見過，我們到希望他能衛破一切困難，能把「阿Q」快點與我們相見。</p>

<p>當比賽或考試時，開步不可借力於主足，須完全靠客足推動，推動須用鞋之全邊，不可用足尖，推動後客足留於後，是趾向下向外，腿自臀邪向外，推動時客足若不和順平均，則必不雅觀。常見通病，是案膝過於靠近主膝，足趾下垂或過於向外。</p>
<p>開步加速力法</p>
<p>（一）將身傾於行動方向，如向右則右傾，向左則左傾、並使身心重心，落在所慾畫之圈綫內。（此法在畫圈時較開步時更易生效。）</p>
<p>（二）將主足在　落地以前，如鐮錘之垂下搖盪。</p>
<p>（三）將任何一臂下垂，且如鐘錘之下盪、切忌將臂平舉。</p>
<p>（四）立在地上之足、將膝挺直，同時用足在地上一推。</p>
<p>以上四法，同時用之，或分開用之均可，若同時酌用之，可免乏力。</p>
<p>四邊開步法</p>
<p>未開步前、須先置直行綫於池中，（名曰直軸）眼定行位，然後開步，國之大小相等，首尾齊平，不可先大後小，或灣曲歪斜。</p>
<p>（一）有外進之開步法</p>
<p>兩足跟靠近，左足與直軸須成四十五角度，舉右足，移至後時，即將右足直向弧綫進，重心須在所欲畫之圈綫內，將任何一臂搖盪至前，但切弗將兩臂同時向前。同時身前傾，並將左足推進，左膝先屈後直，外進時客腿與客肩留後，愈久愈好看，移前時客肩在客腿之先，客腿移前時須伸直，移前之後膝可略潤。</p>
<p>（二）右內進之開步法</p>
<p>一切方法，均與右外進同，但左足與直軸，須成三十角度，內進時客腿在後，愈久愈好看，並伸於所畫圈綫之外，客肩早先移前，致行動時間面向行動方向而不偏側。</p>
<p>內進與外進開步，用立定開步法尚易，身立直，足緊靠，主足與客足成丁字形，開步時曲主膝，切勿曲腰，客足留地，愈久愈好，行動後客趾伸直，向外，挺主膝，並不使客腿移近主腿，（初舉者通病為大腿夾緊，客腿不自臀部伸直，而在膝部曲折。）</p>
<p>（三）有外退之開步法</p>
<p>面向所欲畫之圈綫，左足與直軸平行，舉右足，放在左足之前，搖盪　左足之左，身之中心在左足，同時（甲）身右傾，（乙）右足在左足之前，由左移右，（丙）右臂搖至右方，用左臂亦可，但弗兩臂並用。</p>
<p>（四）右內退之開步法</p>
<p>面向直軸，背向欲畫之圈綫，左足與直軸平行，重心在左足，右足在左足之前盪過，餘如右外退之開步法。</p>
<p>注意——立足趾（即右趾）頃向內，左足須即刻離地，左腿自圈綫內移至圈綫外，此如舵之於船，能將全身轉向也。</p>

<h3>Over the Past Ten Days, the Chinese Army in Northern Hubei has Killed Over 13,000 Japanese Soldiers; Another Unit Advances to Echeng, Threatening Wuchang; the Hanyi Road Recaptures Two Strongholds and Encircles Wamiaoji</h3>
<p>Xiangyang: Since the 2nd of this month, the Japanese have concentrated their forces, relying on air and artillery cover, to launch fierce attacks on the Chinese side in northern Hubei. The Chinese army has fought back bravely. In the fierce fighting in the Tumenchong and YinjiaDian areas, over 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed; near Liujiahe, over 1,500 of the Japanese Horii Regiment were killed; near Tianjiaji and Fangjiaji, over 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed; near Qingtai Town, there were over ten rounds of repeated charges, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 Japanese soldiers. In the Liangjiashan battle, over 1,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. In the Xinjie and Wanjia Shan area, over 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. In total, over 13,800 Japanese soldiers were killed in this area. A large number of spoils of war were captured and are currently being inventoried. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing telegram: Of the various battlefronts, the most intense fighting is currently in central Hubei. Over the past week, the Japanese army has advanced towards Zhongxiang from the Hua-Xiang Road, and the Chinese army has killed over 1,000 Japanese soldiers in successive engagements. Fierce fighting is now taking place near Zhongxiang, and the Japanese army's rear has been cut off, causing considerable panic. The Chinese army in Jiangxi has annihilated 3,000 to 4,000 Japanese soldiers near Nanchang. (Special dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, the Chinese military authorities expressed satisfaction with the results of the recent counter-offensive by the Chinese army in Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces. It is reported that the Japanese army is currently defending Nanchang with a large force, even though the city has in fact lost its military and political importance. The Chinese army's strategy is not to attack the Japanese army's strongholds, but to harass the weaknesses in the Japanese army's line, with the Japanese army's position near Xianning being the weakest. The Chinese army has advanced to Echeng. Echeng is southeast of Wuchang, which indicates that the Japanese army's defenses along the Yangtze River are very "weak." According to military authorities, guerrillas are currently very active in Anyi and Yishi, and have completely surrounded the Japanese defense forces in these two locations. Meanwhile, the Chinese army has also recovered Linqing in southern Hebei and charged into Jiukou on the east bank of the Hanshui River. However, the Chinese army that entered Jiukou withdrew immediately due to the lack of reinforcements. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Yichang) The Chinese army on the front line of the Hanyi Highway has launched another fierce eastward advance. After capturing Fojiajiang on the 12th, the two important high grounds of Yanmenkou and Taliwan were also recaptured. In addition to the hundreds of Japanese soldiers killed by the Chinese army, many of their officers and soldiers were also captured by the Chinese army. The Chinese army has now tightly surrounded Wamiaoji. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<p>Miluo: A certain unit of the Chinese army launched an attack on the Japanese army near Tongcheng on the 30th of last month, making rapid progress and achieving many victories. Up to the 5th, a total of 500 to 600 Japanese soldiers were killed, one infantry gun, four light and heavy machine guns, and twenty-one rifles were captured, as well as many other military supplies. Continuous fierce attacks have been launched against the Japanese army in recent days. The Japanese army is holding firmly to the city, only firing randomly with artillery. The siege is currently underway. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese political figures are now increasingly concerned about the battle situation in Hubei Province. According to Chinese sources, fierce fighting has been taking place on that front since Monday of this week. Although telegraphic communications have not been disrupted, no reports have been received until last night. The Japanese side claims that 50,000 to 60,000 Chinese troops on that line have been surrounded. The Chinese side says that this is Japanese propaganda and an exaggeration. Foreign observers believe that at least the communication between Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway and Xiangyang west of the Hanshui River has been temporarily cut off, but the Chinese army has been quite successful on the Hankou-Yichang Highway. It is rumored that 700 Japanese corpses were abandoned on the battlefield west of Yingcheng. (Every News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Since the 3rd, the Japanese army has been fighting the Chinese army in the Suibei area. After repeated setbacks by the Chinese army, as of the 13th, more than half of the Japanese army has been killed or wounded, and the remaining troops are now demoralized and in a state of depression. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still engaged in fierce fighting south of the Tang River. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Over 1,000 Japanese soldiers who fled north from Zhongxiang on the 8th reached a place more than forty li away from Xiangfan. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, they fled northeast. On the 12th, a fresh force of the Chinese army suddenly emerged from western Henan and went to the Tang River, and then a fierce battle broke out with the Japanese army south of the Tang River. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered heavy losses, with more than half of them killed or wounded. Another unit of the Chinese army pursued the Japanese army south of Zaoyang, also achieving major victories. Fierce fighting is currently underway in the Suixian area. (Telegraph from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hankou outskirt news: In the past ten days, the wharves and stations in Wuhan have been continuously transferring wounded Japanese soldiers, which fully demonstrates the tension of the front-line battles. On the 3rd and 4th, approximately 2,300 wounded soldiers were transported to Hankou from the northwestern Hubei front via the highway, and they were immediately transferred to the Yueyang Maru and sailed downriver on the morning of the 5th. Yesterday, the No. 273 transport ship also transferred over 1,500 wounded soldiers from Wuchang to Shanghai. (Telegraph from the 12th)</p>

<p>Nanyang: Over 1,000 Japanese soldiers suddenly appeared near Xinye on the 10th. The Chinese army bravely engaged them, but due to the disparity in numbers, retreated to the suburbs. Until the Chinese reinforcements arrived in the evening, they fiercely attacked the city walls on the evening of the 11th. The people in the city took the opportunity to respond, attacking from both inside and outside. By the afternoon, two-thirds of the Japanese soldiers had been killed, and the remnants, unable to hold out, fled southeast. Xinye was then declared recaptured. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The 1,000+ Japanese and puppet troops who invaded and occupied Xinye on the 10th were attacked by the Chinese army from all directions. On the 11th, the Japanese army, unable to hold out, collapsed and fled to Wangzhai and Chentan (southeast of Xinye). The Chinese army is currently in pursuit. (Telegraph from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops in Shanxi Province Defect</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Military News: Most of the puppet troops stationed in Weiguo Town, north of Xia County, are fellow countrymen from Northeast China. They are usually subjected to all kinds of orders from the Japanese army. On the 4th of this month, over ten Japanese soldiers forced them to cut down trees in Zhoucun. Over forty of them felt that the time to defect had come, so they rose up together, tied up all the Japanese soldiers monitoring them, and surrendered to a certain unit of the Chinese army. The Chinese army comforted them and incorporated them into its ranks. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<p>Yulin: Qiao Richeng, the commander of the Yanbei puppet security force, recently led his unit of over 1,300 men to defect in Loukou Village, north of Ying County, and was reorganized into the Guerrilla [blank] Brigade by the [blank] Guerrilla Commander [blank]. (Telegraph from the 12th)</p>

<p>Jinhua: Military News: The guerrilla units scattered by the Chinese side on the Eastern Battlefield, after several regular army divisions were dispatched to increase their strength, have launched fierce mobile warfare, posing a major threat to the Japanese army and have cut the Sujia Railway into several sections, closely monitoring the behavior of the Japanese puppet troops in the Wujiang and Tongli areas. Xietang Town, south of Suzhou, was recaptured on the 10th after a fierce attack by the Chinese army, annihilating over fifty Japanese soldiers. (Telegraph from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Multiple Chinese Aircraft Display Their Might Over Fengxin; Heavily Bomb Japanese Positions, Causing Heavy Losses; Nanchang-Anyi Front Line Also Bombed; Ruwu Highway Destroyed for Over Sixty Li</h3>
<p>Gaoan: Multiple Chinese aircraft suddenly appeared over Fengxin on the 13th and bombed Japanese positions fiercely, causing many Japanese deaths and injuries. Then, they soared again over the Nanchang-Anyi front line and bombed them, causing heavy Japanese losses. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<p>Shanggao: On the evening of the 11th, the Chinese army captured Hushan, eight li north of Anyi, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. Then, the Japanese reinforcements arrived, and the Chinese army still returned with a full harvest of spoils of war. (Telegraph from the 12th)</p>
<p>Xiushui: On the 11th, the Chinese army used extremely swift tactics to attack Fengjiapu on the Ruwu Highway, annihilating many Japanese soldiers. Another unit of the Chinese army, in coordination with thousands of civilians, destroyed over sixty li of the Ruwu Highway overnight. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<p>Dongxiang: The [blank] "military" on the west bank of the Fu River, fearing an attack by the Chinese army, bombed the east bank day and night continuously with artillery. On the 12th night, a big fire broke out on the west bank of the Fu River. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Chinese Army Enters Xinhui City; Counterattacks Jiangmen in Three Routes; Has Approached the Suburbs, and the Fighting is Fierce; Chinese Air Force Bombs Tianhe Airfield</h3>

Zhongshan is peaceful, and the coast is heavily guarded. Foreign news: Bai Chongxi has arrived in Shaoguan. The Chinese army's plan to counterattack Guangzhou will be carried out more actively.

The airfield immediately caught fire. The Japanese side was unprepared and panicked. It is said that the losses from this sudden attack were very heavy. (Telegraph from the 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Conducts House-to-House Searches on Gulangyu</h3>
<p>Gulangyu: According to Japanese sources, the Chinese army on the Chinese mainland fired machine guns at Japanese sailors stationed in the Gulangyu concession, so three Japanese naval aircraft went to fight with them this morning. Japanese sailors are currently conducting house-to-house searches on Gulangyu. The British Consul-General on Gulangyu is now in contact with the British destroyer Dico (1,375 tons), which is anchored in Hong Kong, and is closely monitoring whether the Japanese army has violated the rights of British citizens. At the same time, Hong Lixun (transliteration), chairman of the Xiamen Chinese Chamber of Commerce, was shot by an unknown person on Thursday and has now died of his injuries. It should be noted that Hong was shot at the time when a senior Japanese naval officer was on Gulangyu, so the Japanese side took the opportunity to send sailors to land on Gulangyu under this pretext. The trade of local foreign merchants is now encountering difficulties. Two ships of the Taikoo Company that arrived here were unable to unload their cargo because the coolies dared not go out to work. According to Japanese sources, the Chinese army stationed in Songshu (transliteration) on the mainland fired from a bunker at a Japanese sailor patrol on Gulangyu this morning, and the Japanese soldiers returned fire. In addition, three Japanese naval aircraft went to bomb the Chinese army's position, but the results are unknown. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Government Organizes Resident Registration</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>What Should Shanghai Citizens Do Now?</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the streets of Shanghai have been covered with joint announcements from the authorities of the two concessions, banning all political activities of groups. Every Shanghai citizen will naturally pay close attention to such a personal environment, and will also have various different feelings. However, it is hoped that the citizens will have the following common understandings:</p>
<p>1. The current situation in Shanghai is very tense. European and American observers also say: "Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Shanghai situation is the most serious at present." It is possible that Shanghai citizens will fall asleep peacefully tonight, and when they rub their eyes in the morning, the situation will have changed. Under such circumstances, the measures taken by the concession authorities are certainly well-intentioned. We can savor the authorities' painstaking efforts and sincerity in being responsible for protecting the lives and property of the residents in the wording of the announcement, and this point should be acknowledged by all residents within the concessions.</p>
<p>2. The concession authorities' issuance of such an announcement is certainly not without reason, and it is definitely not a suspicion of the residents in the concessions, preventing them from taking any actions detrimental to the authorities' governance. So, what is the intention of the announcement? It is undeniable that the so-called banning of political activities of groups is nothing more than the so-called Chinese patriotic actions that the Japanese side has repeatedly warned the concession authorities about and babbled about endlessly. However, we do not need to embrace pessimism, thinking that the concession authorities' measures this time are an indication of abandoning Shanghai. We should say that this is a way for the concession authorities to maintain the concessions, rather than saying that this is issued for the Japanese side. According to a Washington telegraph on the 12th, the United Kingdom and the United States are now working closely together to prepare to formally respond to Japan's final demands regarding the Shanghai International Settlement. It can be seen that the binding of the residents this time is nothing more than a proposal to "avoid giving cause for criticism"; we should calmly and peacefully accept this proposal; for example, a parent saying to others, "You don't need to interfere in my family's affairs, I have already tied up my family members," we cannot regard this sentence as belittling the family. Of course, the Shanghai concession authorities will never protect the residents' political activities, but we cannot infer from this that the authorities have recognized the oppression of evil forces.</p>
<p>3. The joint announcement issued by the two concession authorities can be said to be an ordinary but also extraordinary thing. Because in order to cope with a special situation, the concession authorities must consult their respective national governments, and will never make their own decisions; the joint announcement this time clearly shows that the relevant countries are brewing a joint action, preparing to take a consistent approach in dealing with Japan's demands. From the Washington telegraph cited above, it can be seen that the United Kingdom and the United States have already cooperated closely; as for the unity between the United Kingdom and France, that is beyond doubt. Looking at it this way, in the Far East issue, democratic countries also have some glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>4. What the authorities are banning is all political activities of groups, which shows that non-political activities of groups are not prohibited. Since losing the leadership of the government, the citizens of Shanghai have maintained a calm attitude, and there are fundamentally no political activities of groups to speak of. As for all legal, non-political group organizations, they are very common, and the citizens of Shanghai have originally regarded this kind of organization as a way to contribute their strength. For example, fundraising, donations, and disaster relief work are often carried out using existing groups, and the citizens of Shanghai have done their best in this, implementing the so-called "those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money." Currently, Shanghai citizens can still work hard in this kind of work, without having to be discouraged at all, because the concession authorities will not be hostile to legal, non-political organizations.</p>
<p>5. The object of the so-called "banning political activities" is very general, and both positive and negative extreme actions and organizations are subject to the ban. Today's Shanghai citizens, on the one hand, sympathize with the authorities' painstaking efforts and forgive the necessity of their measures; but at the same time, they also deeply understand that the authorities will inevitably severely punish all illegal political activities and organizations. We firmly believe that the wise authorities will make "fairness" the highest principle of all measures and will never disappoint the residents.</p>
<p>In addition to understanding the above points, what actions must Shanghai citizens take in order to coordinate with the understanding?</p>
<p>First, every Shanghai citizen should vow to himself that although there are no group activities, they will never live in ease, never evade, and, based on their own position, exert their conscience and strive for the freedom to love the country and love the nation at any time and any place. You must know that people who love the country and love the nation are never afraid to do any kind of work; but they are most afraid of having no work.</p>
<p>Second, since the concession authorities have not shown any indication of compromising or succumbing to evil forces, Shanghai citizens should cherish the authorities, and with a united attitude and firm strength, support the authorities, and maintain the spirit of not compromising and not succumbing, to be the embryo of the Far East international united front.</p>

<p>Thousands of Casualties in Chongqing Bombing</p>
<p>(Chongqing) As a result of last night's Japanese bombing, there were thousands of casualties, with a number similar to that of last Thursday. (According to official statistics, the number of casualties last Thursday was over 7,000, with approximately 2,000 deaths and 5,000 injuries). Furthermore, Jiangfucheng on the north bank of the Jialing River and Tanchizi (transliteration) on the south bank of the Yangtze River suffered extremely heavy losses last night. It is reported that Chongqing residents, after the intense bombing by Japanese planes last week, mostly fled to the aforementioned two locations, believing that Jiangfu and Tanchizi (transliteration) would not be subjected to the Japanese planes' devastating bombings. Who knew that last night, the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes almost all landed in the aforementioned two areas. As a result, there were four fires in Jiangfu and two fires in Tanchizi (transliteration). The devastating bombings of Jiangfu and Tanchizi (transliteration) have greatly increased the relief work in Chongqing. The refugees who had fled to those two areas are now crossing the Jialing and Yangtze Rivers again this morning to return to Chongqing. Chongqing officials originally thought that the work of evacuating civilians had been completed, but now the refugees are returning, almost negating all previous efforts, and they feel helpless. The only solution now is to transport these refugees to the countryside. However, it is reported that some refugees intend to stay here and are unwilling to relocate again. But the police and military authorities will, according to new rules, strive to prevent this trend. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, the local government announced that twenty-seven Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing last night, of which three were shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft artillery. One of them has already been found on the bank of the Jialing River. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing last night, seemingly mostly concentrated on the east bank of the Yangtze River where it merges with the Jialing River. A small town on the north bank of the Jialing River seemed to be targeted by Japanese planes, but according to rescuers who crossed the river last night to aid the injured, the number of casualties was still low, only around 300. Many civilians immediately fled the town when the alarm sounded. After the air raid, a large fire suddenly erupted near the French naval barracks, destroying the office of the American trading company, Weili Han Shipping Company, which was only 200 yards from the barracks. French sailors assisted the Chinese fire brigade in controlling the fire, preventing it from spreading to the French barracks. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Five foreigners and one Chinese person attempted to cross the Yangtze River by boat last night to investigate the fire near the French naval barracks on the opposite bank. The boat collided with a steamer in the middle of the river, nearly capsizing. The five foreigners were French Chargé d'Affaires Nager, Belgian Chargé d'Affaires Tessan, former Belgian Chargé d'Affaires Hewen, who will soon leave Chongqing, Havas News Agency Far East Manager Beril, and Havas Chongqing correspondent Belat. The boat they were traveling in was broken by the collision, and all five foreigners fell into the turbulent Yangtze River. Fortunately, they were all good swimmers and were rescued unharmed by another boat shortly afterward. The accompanying Chinese person did not know how to swim but clung to a broken piece of wood from the boat and floated on the water, also being rescued, although he suffered injuries. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Minister of Health Yan Fuqing stated that as a result of the Japanese air raids on Chongqing on May 3rd and 4th, a total of 5,000 civilians were killed, and 2,000 were injured. A total of 2,391 houses were destroyed by Japanese planes. Yan also mentioned the losses on the Chinese side in the current war, saying that the deaths and injuries of Chinese soldiers now exceed one million. In addition, there are six million children who have gone missing due to their parents being brutally murdered by the Japanese or for other reasons and must be cared for by the state. The number of refugees who have been forced to leave their homes and relocate elsewhere now exceeds 50 million, of whom 16 million belong to the impoverished class and need to be supported by the state. Yan also mentioned the lack of doctors and nurses, saying that China only has 9,000 trained doctors and 6,000 nurses, and there is a great shortage of both types of personnel. Currently, there are 300,000 beds in army hospitals for treating wounded soldiers and 20,000 medical personnel. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Strict Precautions to Prevent Further Attacks</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, the Chinese authorities, in order to prevent Japanese pilots from finding their bombing targets, are specifically advising foreigners to pay special attention and not to light fires during air raids. Even smoking cigarettes and using lighters are prohibited. Because during air raids, the entire city becomes a dark world, and a spark of fire may cause misunderstandings by the Chinese police and lead to serious disputes. Police and soldiers have received orders to manage the entire city when Japanese planes are conducting air raids. Except for journalists and rescue workers, etc., who have passes and can move freely in the city, all other people must go to bomb shelters or hide at home. According to the authorities, even a tiny fire will attract a crowd of Chinese soldiers who will surround the area and investigate the cause of the fire. The authorities also stated that they are currently taking extremely strict precautions, and senior officials will lead police officers to patrol the city. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Bishop Shang Speaks About His Experience of the Attack</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After Chongqing suffered indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes, Catholic churches also suffered heavy losses. Bishop Shang, who witnessed the various atrocities of the Japanese army, was moved by righteous indignation and made a speech while filming the actual situation of the bombing, lodging a serious protest. The original words are translated as follows: "During the air raid on May 4th, the Chongqing Catholic Church also suffered great losses. The place where the bishop was located was hit by two very powerful bombs, leaving two large holes seventeen meters deep on the ground. Several houses immediately collapsed, burying twenty-five people alive in the rubble. Among these twenty-five people, one was a teacher at the Bible school, and fifteen were students. The St. Joseph's Church nursing home and poor people's hospital were hit by two bombs, killing eighteen people. The St. Misae Church and school buildings were also completely destroyed by two bombs, killing six people. Many cities in China have already been subjected to brutal bombing. Now such a tragedy has occurred in Chongqing. Several prosperous commercial centers have been burned down in an instant, killing and bombing more than 6,000 people. Anyone who sees this terrifying situation cannot remain neutral. If someone tells me not to speak, it is simply a great sin. No matter what, there is still a voice of justice and humanity in the world, and my conscience is a reflection of this voice. Therefore, I cannot but join all those with human emotions in seriously protesting these irrational atrocities." (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Catholic Father Bai Wan De broadcast to Europe in French at 5:30 AM on the 15th through the Central Broadcasting Station, describing the Japanese planes' destruction of foreign property. It is heard that the wavelength used by the station for broadcasts to Europe is 25.21 meters. (13th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Widely Rumored in Japanese Newspapers: Secret Treaty Concluded Between China and the Soviet Union; Soviet Union Agrees to Lend China 400 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" and "Yomiuri Shimbun" both published news of the secret conditions of the treaty allegedly concluded between the Chinese and Soviet governments in prominent positions. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" Warsaw dispatch stated that after the Soviet government and General Chiang Kai-shek concluded the secret treaty, the Soviet Union will provide China with a loan of 400 million yuan to purchase military supplies, and half of the 100 million yuan will be used to jointly establish a Sino-Soviet military supplies import company. The Soviet Union also agreed to provide the Chinese government with unlimited pilots and mechanics. Today, the "Yomiuri Shimbun" published a Nanjing dispatch stating that one of the prices the Soviet Union is demanding for assisting China in its war against Japan is that China must consult with Moscow before accepting any third-party mediation. Other Soviet demands include: (1) Absolutely cracking down on the pro-peace faction within the National Government and other controlled areas; (2) Uniform distribution and treatment of the Central Army, the Communist Army, and the provincial armies; (3) Allowing the Soviet Union to develop resources in the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, with only the Communist Army stationed in these three provinces, and establishing a special administrative region, appointing Communist leader Mao Zedong as chairman, and a Soviet military officer stationed there as a military representative; (4) Hiring Soviet experts as military instructors to train soldiers and pilots; (5) Establishing land and air routes between Xi'an, Moscow, via Lanzhou, Hami, and Dihua. After General Chiang Kai-shek received a report from Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, regarding negotiations in Moscow, he approved these concessions in Chongqing in April. The Soviet Union will then provide unlimited material and technical assistance to China in return. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>Britain and Turkey Fight Shoulder to Shoulder to Safeguard Peace in the Mediterranean; Turkish Prime Minister Announces the Conclusion of an Agreement Between the Two Countries to Save Europe from the Calamity of War</h3>
<p>(London) This dispatch, receiving a detailed telegram from the Turkish capital detailing last night's Turkish parliament meeting, is extremely gratified. The telegram said that when Dr. Sertan, Secretary-General of the People's Party and current Minister of the Interior, announced the establishment of the Anglo-Turkish agreement in the crowded chamber, his speech was sincere and touching, arousing the patriotic enthusiasm of the entire chamber and expressing gratitude for the friendship of Britain. His slogan was, "I ask the parliament to allow us to advance shoulder to shoulder with Britain. Britain's goal is to save the world from the calamity of war." Later speakers all echoed the doctor's sentiments. Last night, Prime Minister Bayar addressed the parliament, earnestly stating that the Anglo-Turkish agreement is of utmost importance in Turkish history. Recent changes in events have been as swift as lightning. The government originally intended to maintain a neutral policy, but when the turmoil spread to the Balkans and involved the security of the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey encountered danger and could not maintain its neutral policy. The Mediterranean should be open to all countries for free navigation on an equal basis. Any attempt to interfere with this freedom endangers Turkey's security. Turkey is determined to cooperate with other countries and is willing to fight shoulder to shoulder with all countries seeking to maintain peace, if necessary. Dr. Oyeh, the recently retired ambassador to Britain, also addressed the audience, detailing the recent events in Europe in a way that was shocking. The doctor said that a good country was erased from the world map in twenty-four hours. Romania was threatened with an ultimatum, and Albania's independence was suddenly deprived by Italy. Italy now occupies islands close to Turkey and stockpiles large amounts of troops and war materials on the islands, which endangers Turkey's security. Other parliamentarians also praised Britain's tireless efforts to defend the security and independence of all countries and its intention to resist aggression with force if necessary, saying that this spirit and determination are admirable. They also said that the Turkish army and navy, together with Britain's great military power, will surely safeguard peace in the Mediterranean, and no one will dare to resist them. The parliament then unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the government and pledged to consolidate friendly relations and cooperate sincerely with Britain. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital. The National Assembly met this afternoon, and Prime Minister Sertan immediately reported on the negotiations between Turkey and Britain, briefly stating that the two sides had decided to conclude a reciprocal agreement to ensure the security of both countries. The National Assembly immediately expressed its unanimous approval. The following is a summary of Prime Minister Sertan's speech:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister first said that the government's policy originally focused on maintaining peace and preserving neutrality. Now, the security of the Mediterranean coast and the Balkan Peninsula has been threatened. In order to protect the security of the country, it cannot stick to the old rules and maintain a neutral policy. All countries that have interests on the Mediterranean coast hope that it recognizes this sea as a common sea. Based on this, efforts to maintain order on the Mediterranean coast so that the interests that the countries concerned should enjoy are not deprived. No country shall establish hegemony. It is related to the safety of all countries concerned. Furthermore, the peaceful cooperation of all peace-loving countries will not hesitate to fight when necessary. This is the only effective way to avoid the scourge of war. The government now asks the people to agree to cooperate with Britain for peace and security. This is not aimed at any country, nor is it intended to surround any country. It is only intended to prevent the holocaust of war for the whole nation. "If the rights and interests of our country are threatened, we will defend ourselves by force without hesitation." Our country is also conducting friendly talks with France in order to conclude an agreement similar to the Anglo-Turkish agreement. As for the Soviet Union, "that country is our strong neighbor. The friendship has always been good. In the future, we will still maintain close and sincere relations with it. The interests of the two countries are the same. The views are unified, and it will be easy to unite." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Details of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement Awaiting Discussion; Passage Through the Straits is Not a Problem</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and Turkey, well-informed sources here recently stated that the main details that remain to be resolved are the issue of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits. The method of navigation through these straits has been determined by the 1935 Montreux Convention. At this time, it is necessary to find a way to adapt the Anglo-Turkish agreement to this method. It is generally believed that this matter is very easy to resolve. The fact that British fleets can pass through these straits in wartime is practically certain. As for the agreement being negotiated between France and Turkey, the main point that remains to be resolved is the issue of cooperation between the two countries' fleets in wartime. In short, British and French military experts will soon go to the capital of Turkey to thoroughly study the issue of navigation through the straits and cooperation between the fleets with the Turkish authorities. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Extremely Important Political Nature; Another Achievement of British Diplomacy</p>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain had agreed with Turkey to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, political figures here were extremely pleased, saying that this was another victory for British diplomacy. Responsible people also attach great importance to it and said that in the future, if there is an aggression that could cause a war on the Mediterranean coast, even if Britain is not directly subjected to aggression, it can obtain Turkey's assistance. If war breaks out in Europe, whether Italy participates or not, it will definitely spread to the Mediterranean coast. It can be asserted that the nature of this agreement is extremely important to Britain, which is evident here. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) "The Times" published an editorial today commenting on the value of the Anglo-Turkish agreement, stating that this agreement is an extremely important political event, and its importance lies in the following four points: (1) Turkey is the manager of the Dardanelles Straits, and its alliance with Britain is of great importance to maintaining peace in the Mediterranean; (2) After the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish agreement, it is easier to achieve the goal of creating a Balkan group. As long as the obstacle of Bulgaria is overcome in the first step, it will not be difficult for the Balkan countries to conclude a group; (3) Turkey is a strong country in Asia, and its influence on the Arab countries is very important. After the recent incorporation of the Hatay Republic, the obstacles to Franco-Turkish understanding should be completely eliminated; (4) Finally, the establishment of the Anglo-Turkish agreement is of great benefit to Anglo-Soviet relations, because the Soviet Union does not have to worry about its isolated position if it is attacked. (Haitong, 13th)</p>
<h3>France Reserves the Right to Conclude a Similar Agreement with Turkey; Turkey Demands the Cession of the Sanjak Region as a Prerequisite for Cooperation Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>(Paris) After Britain and Turkey decided to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, France and Turkey will conclude a similar agreement, and the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can also be accelerated. Various newspapers here have recently commented on this, saying that the above agreement is of great strategic importance. Although Germany has tried to obstruct it in many ways, it has not been effective, and it can be said to have suffered a setback. The right-wing "Morning Post" stated that the content of the Anglo-Turkish agreement is said to have two main points: If Turkey is attacked, Britain will provide assistance; If the mandated territories of Egypt and Palestine are attacked, Turkey will provide assistance. As for France, although it concluded an agreement with Turkey in 1927 to guarantee the territorial integrity of the Syrian Republic under French mandate, it still needs to conclude an agreement with it to join the Anglo-Turkish mutual assistance mechanism. "The Soviet Union and Romania have concluded agreements with Turkey, so that in the event of war in the future, warships from the Soviet Union, Romania, Britain, and France can freely pass through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, while the enemy countries cannot." The moderate "Order News" published an article by the famous reporter Bettinax, which stated that the former German Prime Minister Papen was recently appointed as the ambassador to Turkey, and his main task was to prevent Turkey from concluding an agreement with Britain. "Unexpectedly, this agreement was finally concluded, and Germany has suffered a major setback here." From another point of view, Turkey may not have readily accepted the British restraints without obtaining Soviet consent. It is not known how the relations between the Soviet Union and Western European countries will be in the future. It is recalled that during the opening of the European War, the German cruiser "Goeben" took refuge in the Dardanelles Strait. The negotiating countries saw it but could do nothing about it, and the strategic situation in the Mediterranean also changed because of this. At that time, Turkey and Germany and Austria were in collusion. Although Britain and France wanted to supply Russia through the Dardanelles Strait, they were unable to do so as they wished. "Now that Turkey is cooperating with them, Western European countries can freely enter and exit the Black Sea." Moreover, Turkey has agreed to cooperate in defending the Syrian Republic and the regions of Palestine and Egypt, but it demands that the Sanjak region (which belonged to Turkey before the European War and was assigned to Syria after the war, was divided into an autonomous region by the Franco-Turkish agreement last year and placed under Turkish sovereignty as an exchange condition. In our opinion, we should weigh the pros and cons. All the important problems, no matter how important they are, should not be equated with the most important problems." The right-wing "Figaro" reported that Britain had just concluded an economic agreement with Romania and concluded an agreement with Turkey. Germany made every effort to obstruct it diplomatically, but to no avail. The German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, also tried in vain to entice and threaten the Turkish government. Looking at Turkey's strategic agreement with the Soviet Union and its mutual assistance agreement with Britain, the current negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union can be given new impetus within the scope proposed by Britain, and the staff talks advocated by the Soviet Union can also be followed up. The Socialist "People's News" stated, "Under the guidance of Propaganda Minister Goebbels, German newspapers have said that democratic countries only know how to talk, while the Axis powers of Germany and Italy can act. Unexpectedly, democratic countries also have their own ways of acting. They do not boast, but they have also achieved something." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, various newspapers here mentioned the possibility of France ceding the Sanjak region of Alexandria to Turkey as a prerequisite for mutual assistance between France and Turkey. The "Times" diplomatic correspondent said that only a few points remain to be resolved, and then the affairs of the Sanjak region can be finally decided. The "Times" also based its Paris dispatch on an editorial stating that it is not inappropriate to predict that the Sanjak region of Syria will soon be incorporated into Turkey. This development should eliminate the last obstacle to France and Turkey establishing a mutual assistance leap, imitating the British-Turkish method. The political reporter for the "Daily Herald" also took a more prudent tone on the prospects for a resolution after the Sanjak issue is resolved, and did not directly mention the nature of the resolution, but said that this issue is expected to be resolved in time so that it can be submitted to the League of Nations Executive Council for approval. The "News Chronicle" also has a record of the Sanjak region being ceded to Turkey. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Paris Welcomes</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Chamberlain's official statement regarding Turkey today was warmly welcomed here. France's declaration is not yet ready. Its delay is due to the fact that the Franco-Turkish negotiations on the Mediterranean Sea and Alexandria's Sanjak assistance have not yet been completed. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>German and Italian Displeasure</h3>
<p>(Berlin) A German spokesperson today criticized British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons regarding Turkey, saying, "We do not distrust Turkey, but it is of no benefit for Turkey to be enticed to abandon its traditional policy of not endangering itself or anyone else, and to join Britain's encirclement." German political figures stated that every successful decision of British policy equals a new threat to world peace. The "Hamburger Tageblatt" stated that if Britain and France wish to implement their guarantees to Greece and Romania, they must control the Dardanelles Strait, and that the price of buying Turkey into the encirclement line will surely include France ceding the area of ​​northern Syria to Turkey. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German political figures commented on Britain and Turkey's decision to conclude an agreement, saying that Britain is newly afflicted with "treaty-itis", and this is another clear proof. Prime Minister Chamberlain's talk of war is "extremely careless". German officials said that the late Turkish President Kemal Atatürk strictly adhered to neutrality in his foreign policy during his lifetime, but the current government is now going against this, and will regret it too late. Germany and Italy will not be discouraged by this. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the Anglo-Turkish agreement, the tone of various newspapers here today is that this is a further move by Britain to encircle the Axis powers. The Nazi Party's "Völkischer Beobachter" analyzed the effect of the Anglo-Turkish agreement and the Anglo-Polish agreement, saying that the Anglo-Turkish agreement is an encirclement policy aimed at Italy, and the Anglo-Polish agreement is aimed at Germany. The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" commented that the Turkish government's National Assembly had just approved Germany's loan of 150 million marks to Turkey the day before yesterday, and suddenly announced the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish agreement yesterday, which shows that Turkey has suddenly abandoned its neutral policy. This is the result of pressure from Western European countries, and Turkey has also been involved in the wave of Mediterranean encirclement. The "Essener National-Zeitung" asked, "As a result of the Anglo-Turkish agreement, Turkey will fall into the encirclement policy. Do Turkish political figures also know this? This move occurred after Turkey expressed its neutral policy to Germany, which is very infuriating." (Haitong, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian political figures interpreted British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration regarding Turkey today as an insidious action aimed at making Turkey protect British interests in the eastern Mediterranean. They believe that British public opinion is quite confused due to the slow progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, so this declaration was issued to appease them. Fascist Party members expressed doubts about the possibility of an Anglo-Soviet compromise. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Harmonious Relations Between Greece and Turkey, Convergent Policies</h3>
<p>Athens. Newspapers here today published news of the decision by Britain and Turkey to conclude an agreement, praised the speech delivered by the Turkish Prime Minister in the National Assembly yesterday, and spoke of the harmonious relations between Greece and Turkey. Political figures said that the agreement to be concluded between Britain and Turkey has no aggressive goals and is not hostile to any country, which is in line with the foreign policy pursued by our country. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germany's "Three B's Policy" Utterly Failed</h3>
<p>Warsaw. Various newspapers here commented on the decision by Britain and Turkey to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, believing that this was a major failure for Germany. The government's "Polska Gazeta" stated, "Britain has agreed on a mutual assistance agreement with Turkey, and has also established a commercial agreement with Romania. This is truly a serious failure for Germany. From now on, Germany will not only lose Romania's oil, but also be unable to touch the oil produced by Iraq and Iran. Germany's 'Three B's Policy' has completely failed." (Note: The Three B's Policy refers to the route from Berlin to Baghdad through Belgrade.) The "Warsaw Post" stated, "After Britain concluded a mutual assistance agreement with Poland, it also negotiated an agreement with Turkey. This is Germany's first major failure. Today, Germany only has two paths to follow: one is to submit willingly, and the other is to fight to the death." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Papen's Mission to Divide the Anti-Aggression Group Is Disgraceful</h3>
<p>(London) The decision by Britain and Turkey to conclude a mutual assistance agreement has been unanimously emphasized by the newspapers here. They said that the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union should be encouraged as a result. "The Times" stated, "This diplomatic achievement of Britain must be brought into full play to promote Anglo-Soviet negotiations. At the same time, the agreement that France and Turkey should sign should also be completed as soon as possible based on the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, without any obstacles." The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" stated, "Germany had exhausted its efforts to prevent Turkey from joining the anti-aggression group and to promote the signing of an agreement with Germany to break the group. This diplomatic policy was disillusioned due to the establishment of the Anglo-Turkish agreement, and the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, who was responsible for the mission of division, can be described as an unfortunate German diplomat. In this regard, Britain must actively take various steps to enrich the strength of the peace alliance. In this way, Britain's second move will also be easier. Among them, the most effective and important one is to cooperate with the Soviet Union with all its strength." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini to Deliver Speech in Response to Remarks by British and French Prime Ministers</h3>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to travel to Turin tomorrow morning to deliver a speech. The content of the speech is currently unknown, but observers say that the Prime Minister will declare that the mutual assistance agreement negotiated by Britain and Turkey contradicts the Anglo-Italian agreement of April 16 last year. At the same time, he will also address the speech made by the British and French Prime Ministers the day before yesterday and make various demands to France. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>France Has Great Determination to Defend National Freedom, Foreign Minister Bonnet Delivers Speech in England, French Chamber of Deputies Passes Vote of Confidence in the Government</h3>
<p>Sands End Port, England. French Foreign Minister Bonnet and his wife flew here from Paris at 11:15 this morning. They immediately attended a banquet of the "French Expatriate Friendship Association" and delivered a speech, saying, "To this day, the French nation has made a major determination, which is almost known to all countries in the world." If a person cannot enjoy dignity, freedom, and security in the world, then he has no value. Since France has this determination, the various colonial peoples under its responsibility can live and work in dignity, freedom, and security. This is an immutable theory. Moreover, France is determined to pursue peace, but its strength is very strong. On the one hand, it cooperates closely with Britain, and on the other hand, it is still prepared to cooperate with other countries. Foreign Minister Bonnet concluded, "Britain and France have provided guarantees to countries that are determined to defend their freedom and rights. As for the promises and signatures they have provided, they will know how to respect them in the future." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) When the Chamber of Deputies discussed foreign policy today, Socialist leader Blum delivered a speech, stating that although the party agreed with Prime Minister Daladier's declaration regarding the current foreign policy, it was difficult to trust the government because the government had promulgated various substitute legal orders, which only increased the burden on the working class and revised various social legislations. After the Chamber of Deputies discussed the results, it finally passed the vote of confidence by 375 votes to 230 votes. Except for the votes against by the Socialist and Communist Party members, all other members voted in favor. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy's Joint Military Strength, Roman Newspaper Boasts, Claiming They Cannot Be Matched by Britain and France</h3>
<p>(Rome) The "International Relations Magazine" published an article today, emphasizing that the German-Italian axis has 25 million soldiers, and its strength is so strong that it cannot be overcome by others and is a tool to guarantee peace. "The strength of Germany and Italy extends from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Mediterranean, Libya, and the coast of the Indian Ocean in the south. There are 150,000,000 people, all equipped with elite weapons and prepared to defend themselves to the death when necessary." As for the air forces of the two countries, they are also among the most powerful air forces in the world. Their submarine force is far stronger than that of the two Western European countries. "It can be seen that the political and military articles agreed upon by the diplomatic authorities of Germany and Italy in Milan the other day are a powerful guarantee of peace. Recalling that in 1918, Western European countries attempted to use the Treaty of Versailles to establish an unfair and absurd hegemony, now things have changed and those countries have had to make concessions to Germany and Italy based on the principles of justice and reciprocity."

<h3>Amendment to the League of Nations Covenant, Member States Divided into Active and Ordinary Categories, This Session of the Executive Yuan Will Submit for Discussion</h3>
<p>(London) A diplomatic source here recently stated that this regular session of the League of Nations Executive Council may discuss the issue of amending the League Covenant. This proposal will be initiated by the Soviet Union or one of the Balkan states, and supported by Turkey. The current proposed plan is to divide the League of Nations member states into "active" and "ordinary" categories. The former must accept mutual assistance obligations, while the latter does not. British political figures commented that this plan, although not as good as the general collective security system advocated by the former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, is better than the three-nation agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to implement a partial collective security system and is quite favored by the Soviet Union.

Accordingly, the belligerent countries can purchase munitions and raw materials from the United States and entrust them to American merchant ships for transportation. Even if these merchant ships suffer damage, the American government will not bear any responsibility. In addition, the financial provisions of the current Neutrality Act, such as the ban on lending to belligerent countries in cash or on credit, should still be preserved. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<h3>Latvia Determined to Maintain Independence, Foreign Minister Explains Policy</h3>
<p>Riga, Latvia. Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of Latvia's implementation of authoritarian rule under the leadership of President Ulmanis. The Economic Committee and the Cultural Committee jointly held a celebration. Foreign Minister Munters attended the meeting and delivered an important speech, saying that the German government had suggested to our country and the Estonian government that they sign a non-aggression treaty separately. Our country and Estonia have accepted this, because concluding this treaty does not conflict with our country's policy of maintaining neutrality and independence. Taking the example of the Soviet Union also signing non-aggression treaties with its neighbors, if our country's territory is attacked after the treaty is signed, it will naturally rise up to resist. In addition, any treaty that shakes our country's independence will also be resolutely rejected. As for the current international issues, the key to solving them lies with the great powers, but if small countries can maintain two conditions, as our country has done, they can also stay out of the disputes. What are the conditions? One is to strictly maintain neutrality, and the other is to have the determination and necessary strength for self-defense, so that when any great power attempts to conquer this "stubborn" neutral country, it can rise up to resist. "As for our country's determination for self-defense, there is no doubt about it. No matter which country invades our borders, our people will unite to resist it." Moreover, our country's current conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with Germany is beneficial to the security of Northeastern Europe. What should be recognized is that our country has never accepted secret constraints from any country politically or militarily. In the future, in order to cherish the freedom and independence of our policy, we will never accept any constraints and bear obligations. "Estonia is our allied country. After the foreign affairs authorities of that country and I recently exchanged views, we all agreed that Germany's proposal is in line with the neutral policies of our two countries and does not conflict with the existing obligations between our two countries, and decided to accept it." In addition, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, maintaining Latvia's independence is a blessing for the Soviet Union, so it has always been valued by that country. This can be confirmed without doubt after the meeting between our country's ambassador to the Soviet Union and that country's diplomatic authorities last month. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<h3>Brief Biography of Piłsudski, Continued from the Seventh Page of the 12th</h3>
<p>Carried out propaganda and organizational work among young people and workers. He was imprisoned again in 1900, but escaped the country with the help of friends. After that, he engaged in the organization of Polish expatriates in England, Germany, Switzerland, France, and other countries. In 1902, he returned to Kraków to organize an army. When the Great War began in 1914, Piłsudski allied with Russia against Germany and was arrested again. After the war, a revolution occurred in Germany, and Piłsudski regained his freedom. On November 9, 1918, he returned to Poland and immediately organized a government and established a national army. Poland was able to restore its independent status from then on. He was publicly elected as the national leader. Several months after the restoration of the country, Poland fought with the Red Army to protect its borders. The war lasted for two years, and the Red Army was finally driven out of Polish territory. After the war, he resigned in 1923 due to misunderstandings among the leaders of various small parties and retired to the suburbs of Warsaw for three years. In 1926, party struggles in Poland became more intense, and Piłsudski regained power, created new methods, and became one of the great figures in the world. He struggled for fifty years, and worked hard for the country every day. Poland's present state is due to Piłsudski's contribution. (End)</p>

The spokesperson, in discussing the occupation of Gulangyu, emphasized that when an assassination attempt occurred on the island, the commander of the local Japanese fleet was also on the island, so it was necessary to protect him. Regarding the suppression of anti-Japanese activities, the Japanese side had protested to the Gulangyu Municipal Council several times in the past, but they had not taken any action. When asked if the occupation was temporary, the spokesperson replied that he personally believed so, but unless the Gulangyu Municipal Council took appropriate measures to satisfy the Japanese side's demands, the Japanese marines might be forced to</p>
<p>Remain There.</p>
<p>If so, the controversy would become more complex. Japanese soldiers have not occupied the Municipal Council building or public utilities, but are merely patrolling the streets. A reporter asked if the Japanese military was expected to occupy the public concessions in Shanghai. The spokesperson replied that if a serious incident occurred, it might be necessary. A reporter pressed, asking if they would occupy the areas managed by foreign troops at the same time. The spokesperson stated that this</p>
<p>Would Depend on the Situation,</p>
<p>but he was unwilling to discuss the matter. When asked if the occupation of Gulangyu would abolish the status of the public concession there, the spokesperson was unable to answer this question. A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy declared that the announcements issued on Thursday by the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors of both Shanghai concessions were an effort to meet Japanese demands to suppress terrorism and control other</p>
<p>Sabotage Activities.</p>
<p>How the authorities of both concessions will strictly enforce their announcements, and how effective they will be, remains to be seen. A reporter asked if the Japanese side would reserve its attitude towards this appeasement policy. The spokesperson did not give a definite answer to this, but considered it a step forward towards satisfying Japanese demands. The naval spokesperson also responded to questions about the Italian ship "Derbyshire," which recently carried wheat, medical supplies, and a medical team to Ningbo, and was</p>
<p>Detained by the Japanese.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that the Japanese authorities do not welcome the transport of "all items that may help prolong the anti-Japanese resistance of the Chiang regime." Genuine medical supplies are not prohibited, but chemicals used for other purposes besides treating the sick and wounded will not be allowed to be transported from the Japanese-occupied areas to Ningbo and Wenzhou, which are still held by the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Regarding the Joint Announcement Incident</p>
<p>The Continental Times reports that a spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession stated yesterday (the 12th) that although the Japanese side strongly claimed that the joint announcement issued by the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors on Thursday was the result of recent special demands from the Japanese side, this was not the case. The decision of both concessions was entirely their own, but the Japanese side had previously requested the issuance of this order. According to a spokesperson for the Japanese side, who met with reporters yesterday afternoon, the Japanese authorities regard this announcement as a definite step towards</p>
<p>Greater Understanding</p>
<p>between the Japanese side and the two foreign-administered districts, and now it remains to be seen how the spirit of this announcement will be implemented. The spokesperson made this statement after claiming that the announcement was a direct result of the multiple protests made by the Japanese authorities to the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors regarding terrorism and anti-Japanese activities in the two districts. Although the Chinese-language newspapers have not yet commented on the issuance of this announcement, it has already aroused widespread criticism from various Chinese circles. A prominent</p>
<p>Chinese Business Leader</p>
<p>told reporters that given the current unrest in the two concessions, Chinese residents here would not feel overly endangered by the policy adopted by the Municipal Council, but there is no doubt that this is a major concession by the local administrative authorities to the Japanese side. A Chinese banker expressed his approval of the spirit of the issuance of the announcement. It is claimed that he hopes that the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors will match their words with their deeds. If the announcement is treated as law</p>
<p>Not Only Applicable</p>
<p>to Chinese groups, but also applicable to people of all countries, including Japanese and puppet Chinese, then he would be satisfied with it, even though he does not hope for this announcement. His only fear is that the two bureaus will suppress the Chinese in the foreign-administered districts, while being extremely tolerant of the Chinese of the puppet regime under Japanese pressure. If the Chinese here engage in political activities, it must be known that</p>
<p>Puppets Conduct</p>
<p>Such Activities Even More. If foreign-administered districts hope to maintain their neutrality, they must simultaneously prohibit the puppet groups here. There were also a small number of residents who discussed the matter with reporters, expressing indignation at the actions of the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors. One stated that they should not forget that the National Government of China is recognized by all countries, and that the representatives of the various countries here are trying to suppress the so-called "political activities" of Chinese residents.</p>
<h3>The Rice Problem is Severe: The Primary Need is to Open Up Supply Sources. The Rice Evaluation Committee's Suggestions are Pertinent and Concise. Illegal Backroom Transactions Occurred Again Yesterday.</h3>
<p>Since the Bean and Rice Market Management Committee strictly implemented price controls, the market situation once trended toward stability. However, recently, rice-producing areas such as Wuhu have again prohibited the export of rice, leading to scarce supply sources and unrest among market participants. Illegal backroom transactions and violations of price limits have reemerged. The Evaluation Committee reissued a public notice yesterday, posting it in the market and sending letters to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to send representatives to participate and provide guidance. As for the authorities in the concessions, they are reportedly still considering ordering foreign rice. Detailed information is recorded below:</p>
<p>Market Transactions Exceed Price Limits</p>
<p>The bean and rice market had been trending toward stability since strict price controls were implemented. The market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday. However, recently, rice-producing areas such as Wuhu have again prohibited the export of rice, leading to unease in the market. Yesterday, there were again illegal backroom transactions exceeding price limits. The highest price for white rice reached 15.78 yuan, or even 16 yuan. In addition to continuing to enforce price controls and vigorously urging price stability, the Market Management Committee is also conducting strict investigations and reporting to the Evaluation Committee. Anyone who reports violations at any time will be severely punished to protect the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Public Notice to the Market: Strict Enforcement</p>
<p>To strictly enforce price controls, the Rice Evaluation Committee reissued a public notice yesterday, posting it in the market, stating: "This Committee is addressing the rice price problem with both short-term and long-term measures. We have already sent letters to the Chamber of Commerce and the authorities of the two concessions, requesting them to send representatives to participate and provide guidance at any time. We have also suggested ordering foreign rice and opening up inland sources of supply. We will await their replies to follow their instructions. Regarding price limits, it was resolved on the 9th of this month that transactions in this market must comply with the price limits set by the joint meeting of rice industry groups on the 5th of this month. Any violations should be strictly enforced by the Market Management Committee according to the price limits. However, recently, we have heard of backroom transactions exceeding price limits, which is highly inappropriate. All rice industry groups and the Management Committee should conduct strict investigations. Anyone may report violations at any time. If there is no material evidence but there are credible witnesses, they may also report it. Once verified, severe punishment will be imposed. This matter concerns the people's food supply and will not be tolerated. This notice is hereby issued."</p>
<p>Considering Ordering Foreign Rice for Shipment to Shanghai</p>
<p>To prepare for contingencies, the Rice Evaluation Committee has specifically suggested that the authorities of the two concessions order foreign rice for shipment to Shanghai to supplement supplies and open up domestic rice sources to protect the people's food supply. It is reported that the concession authorities have agreed to consider ordering foreign rice and will first submit it to the Joint Rice and Grain Committee for research. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the rice industry yesterday that domestic rice from Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places has been monopolized and prevented from being shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, opening up sources from these two places is practically difficult. It is hoped that the concessions will find ways to open them up, as it is beyond the rice industry's power. Ordering foreign rice at current prices and shipping it to Shanghai would not only be unprofitable but would also incur losses.</p>
<p>Request to Send Representatives to Provide Guidance</p>
<p>In addition to suggesting that the authorities of the two concessions order a large quantity of foreign rice for shipment to Shanghai to supplement supplies and requesting them to send representatives to participate and provide guidance, the Committee also sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating (the suggestions to the concession authorities are omitted above): "Since February, we have been exerting ourselves, but the future is long and the prospects are worrying. This is truly beyond the capacity of this Committee. The only remedy is to earnestly request that your esteemed Chamber send representatives to participate and provide guidance at any time so that the rice industry has instructions to follow and the market situation can be stabilized. We believe that your esteemed Chamber, for the sake of the food supply of all citizens, will surely agree to participate. Secondly, seeking price stabilization, price limits, investigation, and registration are all stopgap measures. The fundamental solution lies in seeking abundant sources of supply. If the sources are blocked and we rely solely on existing reserves, even strict price limits will be difficult to maintain without failure. In today's situation, there are only two ways to seek abundant sources: one is to request that the concession authorities, following the precedent of previous years, order a large amount of foreign rice for storage in Shanghai, so that the people's food supply will be secure and rice prices will be easily suppressed; the other is to request that the concession authorities find ways to open up inland sources. The focal point of rice and grain in Jiangsu Province is Wuxi, and in Anhui Province, it is Wuhu. Traditionally, Shanghai's food supply of both japonica and indica rice has been largely sourced from these two places. Now, these two places have successively prohibited the export of rice and grain. The main reason for the recent scarcity of supplies in Shanghai and the rise in market prices is this. Rice merchants would spare no effort to purchase and transport if there were even slight profits to be made, but they are constrained by the situation and can only lament their helplessness. Only by relying on the concession authorities to find ways to open up these sources, ensuring that a substantial amount of rice from Wuxi and Wuhu is transported to Shanghai daily or monthly, continuously and without interruption, will the effect be equivalent to ordering foreign rice. This has already been suggested by this Committee to the concession authorities, to choose one of these two options for implementation, which would be far superior to various stopgap measures. The above-mentioned matters, one being the earnest request for your esteemed Chamber to participate in the organization of the Evaluation Committee, and the other being the suggestion to the concession authorities to order foreign rice or open up inland sources, are all urgent matters at present. In addition to sending letters to the two concession authorities, we have specially prepared this letter to earnestly request your consideration and approval to send representatives to participate and provide guidance. We are deeply grateful."</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Attach Great Importance</p>
<p>Regarding the request from the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee to order foreign rice and invite participation in the evaluation, it was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the French Municipal Council of the French Concession, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations yesterday morning. Today is the regular Sunday holiday, and the request will be translated into English and French by the two authorities tomorrow before being submitted to the Joint Rice and Grain Management Office and the Rice and Grain Adjustment Office established by the concessions for detailed research. After opinions are signed, it will be submitted to the regular board meeting convened by the Municipal Council on the 16th of this month for discussion. Before the meeting, the authorities will convene representatives of the rice industry to seek their opinions. Various rice industry groups are awaiting instructions from the authorities for handling. According to observations from relevant parties, the current market price of foreign rice is quite high. If purchased and shipped to Shanghai, including tariffs, the price would be over 16 yuan per 180-jin scale (equivalent to one dan). If import tariffs can be reduced or waived, the cost will be reduced, and distribution and sales would not only replenish grain reserves but also suppress the price of domestic rice, which would be an excellent fundamental solution. The urgent task is to find ways to open up the sources of production areas in the interior and facilitate shipment to Shanghai. If we only order foreign rice and do not pay attention to domestic rice sources, it will be difficult to achieve balance in the future regulation of the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Reports of Chen Lifu Advocating Peace Aim to Confuse the Public</h3>
<p>According to sources with connections to political circles, the "New Shen Bao" in Shanghai published reports claiming that Chen Lifu had made statements advocating peace in Chongqing and was suppressing Communist activities. Such bizarre reports are clearly aimed at confusing the public and dividing the forces of the central government, and are not worth taking seriously. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, Mr. Lifu has been encouraging all party members and compatriots to unite spiritually and work together for the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. His contributions to the party and the nation have been significant, and therefore the enemy's hatred for him has deepened.</p>
<h3>Five Chinese Citizens Abducted: Letter Requesting Negotiation. Disregard for Police Authority, Endangering Order.</h3>
<p>The United Office of Shanghai Organizations sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession regarding the abduction of five Chinese citizens on the 9th of this month: "Dear Sirs, Reports in various newspapers on the 10th of this month stated that at 12:00 noon on the 9th of this month, five Chinese citizens were having lunch at the Flurie Jewish Chicken Restaurant on Guangxi Road when more than ten Japanese plainclothes personnel suddenly arrived and abducted them to Hongkou. After careful investigation, this has been confirmed as fact, which caused us deep concern. It is not necessary to delve into the reasons why the five Chinese citizens were arrested. Even if there is evidence of guilt, they should be tried through legal procedures. The fact that they were abducted and secretly arrested is shocking. In the past two years, Japanese authorities have frequently abducted Chinese citizens in the concessions without authorization. Such disregard for the police authority of the concession authorities not only leaves the lives and safety of Chinese citizens without any protection but also endangers the public order and good governance of the entire concession. If this trend is not curbed, it will make all citizens in the concession feel insecure. The five Chinese citizens have no connection with our organizations, but our hearts are filled with concern, and we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to your esteemed Association, hoping that you will send representatives to request the Municipal Council to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese authorities as soon as possible, demanding the immediate release of the abducted five Chinese citizens and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur in the future. This matter concerns the lives and safety of four million Chinese citizens in the concession. We respectfully request your attention and handling. Sincerely, The United Office of Shanghai Organizations, May 12th."</p>
<h3>Ningbo Bombed for the Seventh Time: Over a Hundred Houses Destroyed, More Than a Dozen Killed or Injured</h3>
<p>Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft for the seventh time at noon on the 12th. On that day, seven Japanese aircraft came and dropped sixteen bombs. The bomb-drop locations included the Girls' High School, Jicao Street, Tianyang Lane, Dahe Road, Lotus Lane, Qita Temple, Yaoxing Street, in front of the County Government, Xiaoshi Lane, Maiyu Lane, and other places. Over a hundred houses were destroyed, and more than a dozen people were killed or injured.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Force Raids Huacao Town</h3>
<p>The commander of the joint guerrilla force of Jia, Shang and Qing counties, personally led several dozen soldiers from the Second Directly Subordinate Brigade under Commander Zhu at approximately 3:00 AM yesterday morning, taking advantage of the darkness to raid Huacao Town in western Shanghai. They began attacking the Japanese soldiers stationed in the town with machine guns. Residents in the Xujiahui area could also clearly hear the gunfire. The Japanese soldiers, awakened from their sleep, hastily responded to the attack and suffered many casualties. It took approximately two hours for reinforcements to arrive from Beixinjing. By then, dawn had broken. Commander Yao, seeing that his mission was complete, withdrew peacefully. Before leaving, they arrested Zhao Jiayou (26 years old, a native of Huacao), the former head of the local self-government association, executing him on the spot and displaying his head as a warning.</p>

<h3>Fresh Pork Slaughter Suspended: Meat Industry Completely Suspends Sales. Respecting City Image, Will Not Close Doors. Hoping Authorities Will Properly Handle Aftermath.</h3>
<p>Due to the illegal seizure and blockage of fresh pork supplies by the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou, the slaughterhouses in the two concessions have suspended slaughter. The fresh meat industry has been forced to suspend sales but will not close their doors out of respect for the city image of the concessions. However, they hope that the authorities will properly handle the aftermath. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fresh Pork Shipments to Shanghai Have Disappeared</p>
<p>After the fresh pork industry declared its stance and vowed not to participate in illegal organizations, fresh pork shipments to Shanghai from the New Harbor were repeatedly illegally seized by the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. Negotiations between suppliers and the shipping companies failed, causing suppliers to view shipments to Shanghai as a long-distance burden, depleting their resources, and virtually cutting off the supply. Japanese warships in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have also been obstructing British ships from loading fresh pork. Although protests were lodged with the Navy without success, various transport suppliers, lacking protection, have sent telegrams to cease operations one after another. As a result, since last week, shipments of fresh pork to Shanghai have disappeared.</p>
<p>Slaughterhouses Suspend Pork Slaughter</p>
<p>The pork slaughterhouses in Shanghai are the Suxi Slaughter Company located at No. 50, Lane 1050, North Chengdu Road in the Public Concession, the Xinninghai Slaughter Company located at No. 4, Lane 1050, North Chengdu Road, and the Municipal Slaughterhouse of the French Concession located at No. 296, Avenue Foch. Usually, these three companies collectively slaughter 2,500 pigs per day. Now, due to the disruption of fresh pork supplies, there are no pigs to slaughter, and they have been forced to suspend slaughtering pigs starting from the morning of the 13th. They had already slaughtered all the remaining pigs in storage on the 12th.</p>
<p>Fresh Meat Shops and Stalls All Suspend Sales</p>
<p>There are over two thousand fresh meat businesses in the Public Concession and the French Concession, including meat stalls, divided into four major groups: Suxi, stealing from Shanghai. Because pigs shipped to Shanghai by the fresh pork industry have been detained by the "Livestock Market," resulting in a disruption of supply and no goods for sale, and after separate discussions, they have decided to temporarily suspend sales starting today. However, they will not close their doors out of respect for the city image of the concessions and have advised employees to stay in the shops and not go out, encouraging them to follow the motto "Do not make empty talk, do peaceful things." They have universally advised the industry to comply and strictly prohibit secret hoarding and sales.</p>
<p>Forced by Circumstances, Will Not Close Doors</p>
<p>The soaring prices of fresh meat in the market have led industry leaders to earnestly advise against raising prices. Yesterday's market prices were 1.125 yuan per jin for wholesale and 1.25 yuan per jin for retail leg meat, and 1.1875 yuan per jin for streaky pork. However, because the supply of fresh meat has been disrupted, over five hundred meat stalls in the two concessions have voluntarily suspended operations. Therefore, the number of meat stalls in various small markets has decreased significantly. As for the meat shops and stalls that are barely operating, they will have no meat to sell after the 15th. However, in accordance with the industry's decision, they will not close their doors.</p>
<p>Hoping Authorities Will Properly Handle the Aftermath</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries with the fresh pork industry and the fresh meat industry revealed that shipments of fresh pork to Shanghai have been blocked and illegally seized by the "Livestock Market," causing the fresh pork industry to wire suppliers in Jiangbei to stop shipments. Slaughterhouses have been forced to suspend slaughter, and the fresh meat industry has been forced to suspend sales, affecting the entire Shanghai meat supply. However, as this is a forced situation, they hope for understanding and sympathy from all sectors. Hereafter, they only hope that the authorities of the two concessions will promptly arrange proper measures to handle the aftermath and maintain the business of legitimate merchants, so as not to affect the meat supply of millions of citizens.</p>
<p>The Puppet Faction Detains Pigs: No Place to Hoard Livestock</p>
<p>The "Livestock Market" of the Japanese puppet organization, after being rejected by the fresh pork industry in this city, is implementing a conspiracy of oppression. It has unified the transportation of inland pigs, shipping them to Shanghai on Nissin Company ships and colluding with the Jilin Feng Customs Brokerage for smuggling and tax evasion. Any fresh pigs transported by pig merchants on any foreign shipping company are subject to detention by the Japanese naval authorities or forced to stop loading. Although the puppet "Market" is now shipping over two thousand pigs from the New Harbor daily, originally intending to monopolize sales in the Shanghai market, it has been unable to sell them due to the industry's unanimous rejection and monitoring to prevent the sale of pork from unknown sources. Therefore, the puppet "Market" has no way to sell them, and the number of live pigs that have not been slaughtered is increasing daily. There is no place to hoard livestock. According to news from the "Market," the Japanese puppets are very anxious about this. Several pigs die every day. The weather is hot, and if swine fever is discovered, it will have a serious impact on Shanghai's sanitation. Currently, the industry hopes that citizens will not be greedy and buy cheap fresh meat from unknown sources, which could harm their health.</p>
<p>Beef, Mutton, Chicken, and Duck Industries' Expressions</p>
<p>Inquiries with the beef, mutton, chicken, and duck industries in this city revealed that the oppressive methods of the "Livestock Market" in illegally controlling the transportation of livestock are becoming increasingly serious. Fresh pork has already been forced to suspend sales. How will they cope if this behavior is applied to the beef, mutton, chicken, and duck industries? Each industry has expressed that they are already suffering greatly from the oppression of the illegal "Market." However, out of respect for human dignity and to maintain a legitimate business stance, in addition to strictly warning all members of the industry not to participate in the puppet "Market" and vowing not to cooperate, if the puppet faction uses the same means of oppression against the fresh pork industry to oppress the beef, mutton, chicken, and duck industries in the future, they will only sacrifice their business to resist.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police in Nanshi Uprising: Heading Towards the Shanghai-Minhang Highway; Now Joined the Guerrilla Force to Fight Against Japan</h3>
<p>Six puppet police officers from the Nanshi Branch of the puppet "Police Bureau" suddenly revolted last night (the 12th), carrying weapons. Upon hearing the news, Wang Zhizhang, the head of the puppet branch, urgently telegraphed the Kikuchi Unit of the Japanese garrison to dispatch troops to pursue them. The revolting puppet police officers had already headed towards the Shanghai-Minhang Highway along Guohuo Road. The Japanese army was unable to catch up, making a fruitless round trip and achieving nothing. It is said that the puppet police suddenly decided to revolt because they could not withstand the oppression of the Japanese army and resolutely made this decision. They have now joined the guerrilla force to fight against Japan.</p>
<h3>Strict Tax Customs Orders in Vietnam: Travelers Encounter Hardships at the Border; Fines are Imposed for Carrying Razor Blades and Matches; There Are Even Cases of Passing Paper Money During Handshakes</h3>
<p>Recently, those traveling by sea to Sichuan and Yunnan must pass through French Vietnam. The tax customs orders in that area are extremely strict, and travelers often unknowingly violate the prohibitions by carrying personal items, leading to endless troubles. The current issue of the *China Weekly Review* contains a letter from John D., which details the prohibitions of the Vietnamese tax customs, and is translated below so that travelers can read it and take precautions:</p>
<p>I read an article in your issue of April 29, which detailed the grievances of Chinese travelers passing through Vietnam due to various treatments, to draw public attention to it. Several of my friends have personally experienced it, so I can verify the various points mentioned in the article. I will briefly describe one or two of them, which I believe readers will be happy to hear.</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from a gentleman who had been received by the Chinese Consul General in Haiphong. Therefore, he was not disturbed when he passed through the tax customs, but he witnessed the treatment of several of his fellow passengers. They clearly did not carry new items in their luggage or on their bodies. Only two or three shaving razor blades were allowed, and even new toothbrushes had to be taxed. Matches were absolutely prohibited. If a traveler happened to carry a matchbox, they sometimes had to pay a fine according to the number of matches. Shirts that had been ironed were also considered new and taxed. A certain passenger was fined 5 piastres (equivalent to 10 Chinese yuan) for carrying two cans of fruit, as the regulations only allowed one can. The behavior of the Annamese people is often more extreme than that of their French masters. Those who are well-dressed seem to be treated more harshly than the average person. The assessment of taxes and fines seems to be without any set rules. If travelers try to explain or argue, the fine is immediately doubled. If they continue to argue, it is doubled again. If they do not pay the fine, they are threatened with imprisonment. The writer of the letter did not know that this threat was being implemented.</p>
<p>Bribery is Rampant</p>
<p>As many expect, according to the letter, there are various ways for travelers to receive better treatment. The suitcase carried by a traveler is often emptied of all its contents onto the dirty floor so that customs officials can inspect it. After the inspection, the traveler naturally has to repack it themselves, and no one will help. Several travelers, in order to avoid this disturbance, put paper money into prohibited matchboxes, which were then confiscated. There are also those who hide paper money in their palms before shaking hands with customs officials. I believe that your publication of these facts will indeed be beneficial to the Chinese people in Shanghai and other places.</p>
<h3>Reward Measures for Volunteer Reserve Team of Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council has formulated a method of awarding medals to reward the long-term service of members of the Volunteer Reserve Team of the Fire Brigade. Any team member who has served for twelve years and is proficient in practical work can be recommended by the supervisor to apply for a medal. After that, an additional ribbon can be issued every five years. The style of the medal is the same as that of the police medal for the sake of uniformity.</p>
<h3>Naked Cooperation: Performing Naked Dances at the Banquet; Director of Japanese Intelligence Agency Performs in Shanghai; Shocking News from Tokyo's *Kokumin Shimbun*</h3>
<p>The current issue of the *China Weekly Review* contains an interesting anecdote, saying that former Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Kawai, now serves as the director of the Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. He recently visited Shanghai. At that time, British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, and British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, were in Shanghai for talks. The Chinese newspapers pointed out that Kawai brought huge sums of money to Shanghai to help the anti-British movement, as the thirty newspapers published in the areas occupied by the Japanese army suddenly made the same anti-British propaganda. But Tokyo's major newspaper, *Kokumin Shimbun*, carried even more shocking news (see the newspaper on April 30), saying that Kawai was entertained in Shanghai by several Chinese friends, namely those serving in the "Greater Shanghai City Government." During the banquet, the initiator's speech advocated that China and Japan should "cooperate in East Asia." Kawai said that if China and Japan want to achieve this "cooperation," they must embrace a "naked" will towards each other. To make people understand the meaning of his saying, the former Consul General took off his clothes at the banquet and performed a naked dance in front of his Chinese hosts. *Kokumin Shimbun* also said that the Chinese were deeply moved when they saw this, and Kawai's popularity increased because of this ("Greater Shanghai City Government").</p>
<h3>After Negotiation, *De Ping* Released; Resuming Sailing to Wenzhou Tomorrow Night; *En De* Returns to Shanghai from Wenzhou</h3>
<p>The Italian merchant ship *De Ping* of the Sino-Italian Company, after being detained by the Japanese, was released on the evening of the 12th of this month as a result of negotiations by the Italian Consulate in Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow night (the 15th). Also, after the company's ship *En De* resumed sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, the ship returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday morning and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (the 14th). The three ships *Golden, Wilkinson,* and *Tinball*, which are still detained, are being negotiated separately by the German and Italian Consulates. Once the negotiation procedures are completed, they will be released soon.</p>
<h3>Belgian Reporter Arrested after Returning to Japan from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Foreigners in this city received news from Tokyo, Japan, that two Belgians were arrested by the Tokyo Japanese police. One is B. Yan (transliteration), 70 years old, a reporter for a newspaper in Paris. B. had just returned to Japan from Shanghai on April 20. The other is C. Reller (transliteration), 38 years old, currently a Catholic priest. He was arrested two days ago. According to reports, the reason for the arrest is engaging in trade for profit, which violates the law.</p>
<h3>Consul Corps Secretary Long Returns to America on Vacation</h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that the Secretary of the Consul Corps in this city, Mr. Long, is scheduled to leave Shanghai in early June and return to the United States for a half-year vacation. He has recently transferred his position as Secretary to Mr. Paer of the Italian Consulate General. Mr. Long has served in China for over twenty years and has been Secretary of the Consul Corps for eleven years. Paer has been in Shanghai for five years, first as a representative of an Italian aviation company, and three years ago, he joined the Italian Consulate General in Shanghai. This appointment was recommended by the Italian Consul General and is temporarily serving as Secretary of the Consul Corps. After six months, when Mr. Long returns to Shanghai to resume his duties, Paer will continue to serve at the Italian Consulate General.</p>
<h3>Abundant Funds in Shanghai, Lack of Investment Opportunities, Commodity Prices Rise by 18% This Year, International Trade Imports and Exports Both Decrease</h3>
<p>——Annual Report of Shanghai Banks——</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank's report for 1938 (27th year of the Republic of China) stated: "This year, the domestic economic situation suffered unprecedented misfortune due to the spread of war. The losses are the greatest in our country's history. Furthermore, the economic conditions in various regions have experienced various abnormal phenomena due to the different impacts of the war. Generally speaking, both production and consumption have declined. As for the economic situation abroad, the conditions in various countries are quite uneven due to different environments and policies, but the signs of recession seem to be more common. The domestic economic situation is now divided into financial, trade, commodity prices, and industry and commerce, and each item is summarized on the left."</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>"Following the financial panic of last autumn, the financial stabilization measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance continued to be implemented this year. The lending committee organized by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank also successively handled lending matters in various places. In addition, the government was determined to maintain the legal tender (fapi) throughout, and friendly governments and financial institutions in the United Kingdom and the United States also provided assistance whenever possible. Therefore, although the war situation deteriorated day by day, the financial market was able to remain as stable as usual. Not only was there no run on deposits, but also a large amount of previously fleeing funds returned. Financial institutions, with the exception of one or two small banks, did not go bankrupt. The Shanghai interbank offered rate did not fluctuate abnormally throughout the year, and even the unofficial market price of government bonds rose steadily. All of this was beyond our expectations and is gratifying. Under this relatively stable situation, there are also several important events that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>Black Market for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the government still strove to maintain the statutory exchange rate. Later, due to environmental reasons, the "Foreign Exchange Application Procedure" was promulgated on March 14, stipulating that when banks need foreign exchange for legitimate purposes after offsetting receipts and payments, they must apply to the Central Bank for purchase. After the Central Bank approves it, it sells the foreign exchange at the statutory price, so as to moderately restrict the supply of foreign exchange. In June, it successively stipulated the types of goods that restrict imports, and the foreign exchange of export goods should also be sold to national banks. On August 8, it was stipulated that applications for foreign exchange for goods shipped and imported after January 1 of this year will no longer be accepted, except for necessities. The market's need for foreign exchange could not be fully met, and the so-called black market came into being. The unofficial exchange rate of the legal tender successively fell from one shilling and two and a half pence, reaching seven shillings and eight seven five pence in August. However, since the second half of the year, the exchange rate in this black market has often hovered above eight pence. After the establishment of British and American loans, it was expected to be firm, and it can be seen that the value of the legal tender, even under the control of the black market, can still maintain a considerable stability."</p>
<p>Transfer Discount</p>
<p>"The Shanghai remittance and currency exchange were originally scheduled for cash settlement the next day, but since the Ministry of Finance implemented the financial stabilization measures, the so-called interbank remittance was only for transfer of accounts, not for cash withdrawal, and could not be used to purchase foreign exchange. Since its use was restricted, a discount method was introduced if it was to be exchanged for cash. This was already evident in the second half of last year, and this year it became even more intense. Later, the Joint Reserve Board came out to maintain it and injected a large amount of funds, and it was restored. By the end of this year, the number of legal tender chips on the market has increased considerably, and the remittance discount has been trending downward. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai financial market has added a new chip. Customers and firms often have to open two accounts, one for legal tender and one for remittance, which is also an abnormal phenomenon of wartime finance."</p>
<p>Remittance Obstruction</p>
<p>"This year, the war gradually moved westward, and transportation between Shanghai and the interior became increasingly inconvenient. Before and during the war, a large number of goods were transported from Shanghai to the interior, but it was not easy to transport a large amount of local goods out of the interior, and they were controlled by the government. The amount of money remitted from the interior to Shanghai far exceeded the amount remitted from Shanghai to the interior, so the exchange rate became increasingly high, and there was the pain of not being able to adjust remittances anywhere. In addition, the exchange rates between Shanghai and various ports in North China were also quite chaotic. Therefore, funds in various places are not easy to support each other, which is also affected by the war."</p>
<p>Shanghai Funds</p>
<p>"Since the war has left the Shanghai and Nanjing area, the number of people from the interior who have come to Shanghai to take refuge has increased day by day, and a large amount of funds from the war zone have flowed in. The funds used to purchase foreign exchange before and during the war have also returned due to earning interest by sitting idle. Therefore, Shanghai funds have gradually become abundant. Current deposits in the financial industry have increased considerably, and the number of chips on the market has become increasingly loose. Speculative undertakings have also risen accordingly. From the trading of foreign currency, gold, and stocks to the hoarding of various commodities, it is more prosperous than before the war. Using funds for non-productive purposes cannot but be regarded as a hidden danger in wartime economy."</p>
<p>Southwest Finance</p>
<p>"Since the government moved westward, the economic development of the southwest brooks no delay. In order to meet the needs of people in the interior, the major financial institutions in this city have opened branches in important locations in the southwest provinces, and the number of them has increased day by day. Many financial institutions in the war zone have also retreated to the southwest with the government, and people's funds have gradually been transferred in to supply local production undertakings. At present, Shanghai's funds lack investment opportunities. If they can be transferred to the interior under the principle of safety, it will be of no small help to the economic development of the southwest. All of the above are characteristics of wartime finance this year. Although it is not all satisfactory, if we understand the seriousness of this decisive battle and the vastness of its spread, we have to regard the stability of the financial situation this year as a rare phenomenon. The government's efforts to protect currency, stabilize finance, and maintain credit, as well as the cooperation of friendly financial institutions, have made great contributions." (To be read)</p>

Due to the dark night, and the guerrillas were quick in action, they were not subject to any resistance when boarding the ship, nor did they fire a single bullet. In a short time, they seized a large number of machine guns, rifles, and other weapons, and safely returned to the sailing boats.

When the Japanese harbor personnel were informed, they immediately drove a small motorboat with Chinese customs sailors to chase after them.

<p>The Japanese soldiers in western Shanghai have weak defenses. A newly established pseudo-"armed police force" of 500 people, carrying old firearms, is headed by a pseudo-"battalion commander" named Han Jun, who is not under the command of the pseudo-"police bureau chief Lu Ying, but is controlled by the Japanese secret service, in order to increase their defenses.

<h3>Mr. Yuan Ludeng Talks About Disaster Relief Undertakings, Still Relying On Donations From All Parties, Relief Committee Remits 70,000 Yuan to the Association as Part of the Relief Funds for Refugees</h3>
<p>A reporter yesterday interviewed Yuan Ludeng, the secretary-general of the Refugee Relief Association, to talk about the recent situation of the relief undertakings. According to him, regarding the funds for relief chickens, thanks to the donations from all parties, they can be maintained. Recently, the Central Relief Committee remitted 200,000 yuan to Shanghai, which is distributed to the Shanghai Relief Association at 35,000 yuan per month, totaling 70,000 yuan. This money will be used as part of the relief funds for refugees. However, the relief undertakings are complex and involve thousands of strands, and they rely on donations from all parties to gather sufficient funds so that the refugees can get out of the water and fire as soon as possible. Refugee education is very important, and the association is planning to have proper measures. In the future, the elderly, weak, women, and children refugees will also be able to have a place to end their lives and a place for their children to return. Therefore, various plans are still awaiting the accumulation of relief funds to be gradually implemented.</p>

<h3>Comparison of Charitable Lottery Prize Money by Period, Eighth Period Ticket Sales Are the Best, A Total of 500,000 Yuan in Relief Funds Have Been Issued</h3>
<p>The French Concession Refugee Relief Charitable Lottery has been issued for ten periods. Because it concerns the nature of relief and the methods are proper, its credibility has been increasing day by day, and its sales have been increasing sharply. Since the fourth period, the total amount of the ticket has been changed to half, and the whole ticket has been changed to five strips, sold at 5 yuan national currency. After each strip is sold at 1 yuan national currency, more and more people are eager to buy tickets. Now, the amount of the first prize and the total amount of relief funds to be provided for each period since the fourth period are compared as follows: (Fourth Period) The first prize is 41,750 yuan for the whole ticket, and 8,350 yuan for each strip, with 50,100 yuan in relief funds being provided. (Fifth Period) The first prize is 37,675 yuan for the whole ticket, and 7,535 yuan for each strip, with 45,210 yuan in relief funds being provided. (Sixth Period) The first prize is 39,000 yuan for the whole ticket, and 7,800 yuan for each strip, with 46,800 yuan in relief funds being provided.

<h3>Big Fire at the Intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Tiantong Road in Shanghai, Two People Died in the Fire, Five People Were Burned and Fell</h3>
<p>At 2:30 a.m. yesterday morning, a fire broke out at No. 835, North Zhejiang Road, Tiantong Road, Public Concession. Black smoke was like ink, and the flames were soaring. At that time, it was the time for the wind to help the misfortune. In an instant, it spread to two buildings next door, No. 833 and No. 837. When the fire was raging, because it was late at night, residents could not escape in time, resulting in the burning to death of a family of three, a man, a woman, and a girl, namely Mao A Fa, 25 years old, Mao Xi, 48 years old, and girl Qian A Mao (10 years old). The three corpses were climbed out by firefighters in the rubble, their heads were charred, and they were unbearable to look at. There were also five people who were burned and jumped from the building and fell, namely Zhou Jingeng, 33 years old, injured in the left foot, Zhou Zhao, 34 years old, injured in the head and fracture of the left knee bone, Wu Xu, 33 years old, burned upper body, Qian Xi, 44 years old, burned left arm, and boy Wu Liuzi, 6 years old, fell from the window and seriously injured his head due to the burning of the ladder. The fire scene was driven by the Fire Department to the scene and tried to extinguish the fire until 4 o'clock. A total of three houses were burned and injured people were sent to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The corpses were sent to the autopsy office to be autopsied. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the patrol.</p>
<h3>Fire in Metal Shop, Girl Burned to Death</h3>
<p>Zhang Mingzheng (30 years old), a native of Wuxi, who opened the Yuanchang Metal Shop at No. 313, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, suddenly broke out in a big fire in the shop at 3 a.m. yesterday. In a moment, it was out of control. The neighbors who lived upstairs were awakened from their sleep and rushed out of the door. Only Hui Zhen, the 9-year-old girl of Chen Wenjie, a native of Songjiang, who lived in the pavilion room on the third floor, was buried in the fire because her parents only cared about grabbing clothes and sundries and did not rescue her. After the Fire Department drove to the scene and put out the fire, Chen's body was pulled out, already charred and unbearable to look at. The body was then sent to the Tongren Auxiliary Yamen for autopsy. On one side, the patrol took the fire source, Zhang Mingzheng, the owner of the Yuanchang Metal Shop, to the case for investigation of the cause of the fire. Yesterday, the patrol reported to Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Special Second Court, who came to the office to clarify that the deceased Chen Zhuanzhen was burned to death. Because the body's father had not yet arrived at the case, the official ordered the corpse to be handed over to the church for burial, and the fire offender was investigated and dealt with by the police department.</p>

<h3>Lead Bucket with False Bottom Containing Opium Intercepted</h3>
<p>Shen Shuting, 39 years old, a native of Chongming, was seen holding a lead bucket at No. 166, Baliqiao Street, French Concession the day before yesterday. While hiring a rickshaw, he was found suspicious by the French patrol No. 350 and the Chinese patrol No. 996. It was found that the lead bucket had a false bottom and contained two red soil, weighing 24 taels. He was taken to the patrol. According to him, the soil was bought from Ma Lao Si on the rear building of No. 64, Huacheng Road, and he planned to take it back to Chongming with Zhang Zhishan for sale. Zhang was traveling with me behind. Seeing that I was arrested, he fled. The chief of the patrol immediately sent detectives Gao Meiyan and detectives Wu Wengang and Chen Tiemin to arrest Ma Lao Si. He had already heard the news and fled. Only more than ten taels of scattered opium were copied in his house and taken back to the patrol. Yesterday, Shen was sent to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Special Second Court, requesting a change of date for the investigation and interrogation of Ran. After questioning by Judge Qiu, he ordered a change of date for the 16th for another interrogation, and the defendant was detained.</p>
<h3>Bathing Buddha Festival is Approaching, Temporary Market is Suspended</h3>
<p>Shewen Sheyun, May 26 (Lunar April 8) is the Bathing Buddha Festival. In previous years, Jing'an Temple would build straw sheds around the temple to attract merchants to set up stalls. For a time, the stalls were crowded and extremely prosperous. It is learned that the temporary market for this Bathing Buddha Festival will be temporarily suspended due to the current unusual circumstances.</p>
<h3>Pan Cheng's Assassination: No Political Connection, Dismissal of Messenger Led to Petty Hatred, Once Doused with Feces</h3>
<p>Pan Chengjiong (also known as Pan Muzhong, 45 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 16, Datongfang, Lane 127, Yaozhu Jiao Road, French Concession), the chief of dispatch and receipt at the Great Northern Telegraph Company, was stabbed in the back twice and on the left cheek once with a sharp knife by Wang Chenggong (21 years old, from Shandong) at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday while passing the YMCA on Avenue Petain in the French Concession. After being wounded, Pan still chased the assailant to the corner of Caishi Street and Bali Bridge Street before collapsing due to his injuries. Officer No. 961 apprehended the assailant and took him back to the police station for investigation. Pan was rushed to Guangci Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 8:30 PM that night. All details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. After receiving news from the hospital that Pan had died, the French police immediately transported the body to the autopsy room at the Public Works Department Hospital on Avenue Talas. Pan's wife, Wang (48 years old, from Beiping), was notified, and yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Qian of the Second Special Court arrived to examine the body. According to investigators' reports on the incident, the wife requested to claim the body and requested a strict investigation of the assailant to avenge the deceased. The official declared that Pan Muzhong had indeed died from stabbing wounds, and the body was handed over to Pan's wife for burial. The defendant was handed over to the court by the police department for legal proceedings. It is said that the deceased was strict in his duties during his lifetime, which led to resentment.</p>
<p>Further news reports that the circumstances of the death of Pan Chengjiong, director of the dispatch office of the Great Northern Telegraph Company in this port, who was stabbed to death by a thug, have been published in various newspapers. However, the truth of his murder is rumored differently. It is now known that Mr. Pan has served in the telegraph industry for decades, has both good character and learning, and is serious in his work. He has always been admired by his colleagues, but he is stricter with his subordinates, which may have led to hatred and resulted in this unexpected disaster. Several months ago, a messenger was dismissed by Pan for violating regulations and harbored deep resentment. Later, Mr. Pan was splashed with feces by a rogue, which was due to this. Mr. Pan reported this to the police for legal action. This murder case is likely related to this matter. As for the leaflets that mentioned a political role, according to the company's colleagues, Mr. Pan was always loyal and law-abiding and worked hard in his duties. The rumors are absolutely inaccurate and must be the murderer deliberately playing tricks and trying to confuse the public.</p>
<h3>Guiding Girl Asks to Settle Accounts, Ends Up Beaten, Pregnant and Severely Injured, Accounting Partners Detained for Investigation</h3>

At 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, Peng suddenly asked Wu Renrong, a Changzhou native who was the accountant of the agency, to settle the accounts. Wu refused, fearing that Peng would join another agency after settling the accounts, which led to a conflict. At that time, Wu Renrong and Wu Wenjun, partners in the agency, beat Peng, who was already six months pregnant, causing injuries to her abdomen. After reporting to the Laozha Police Station, Chinese detective Wang Yingjie arrested the two Wus and sent them to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted them for injury and stated that according to the doctor's report, the injury to Peng's abdomen may endanger the fetus, so she needs to stay in the hospital and cannot attend court today. He requested a postponement for another hearing. After Magistrate Dai Rongduo questioned the two defendants, he ordered them to be detained for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Suspect in Robbery and Murder of Vietnamese Constable Taken to Court for Interrogation Yesterday</h3>

<p>At 9:30 PM last night, a rickshaw traveling from south to north passed in front of a joss stick and paper shop at the intersection of Shantou Road in the Public Concession. A young man was sitting in the rickshaw, holding a glass bottle. Somehow, the bottle broke, and in an instant, the entire rickshaw was engulfed in flames. The young man in the rickshaw jumped out and fled upon seeing the disaster, and the rickshaw puller also abandoned the rickshaw and ran away. A patrolling officer noticed it, blew his whistle, and the fire brigade was notified and dispatched two fire engines to put out the fire. However, only the frame of the burned rickshaw remained. After investigation, it was found that the young man in the rickshaw was holding two bottles of gasoline, which accidentally broke, leaked, and caught fire from the rickshaw lamp, causing the fire.</p>
<h3>The Pujiang Smuggling Case Was Reported by Jealous Competitors</h3>
<p>Regarding the Pujiang smuggling case of a huge amount of opium, it is now heard that the Japanese side is thoroughly investigating it. It is said that this 7,500 taels of Yunnan opium, worth 100,000 gold coins, was purchased by a large firm in West Shanghai. This opium firm has long been at odds with the puppet police局, and jealousy has arisen among its competitors. Someone reported the secret of this opium transportation to the puppet “警局”, leading to the exposure. The major opium trafficker in this case has also fled.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Forges License</h3>

The Public Works Department prosecuted him for forgery, and he was sentenced to 25 days of detention or a fine of 50 yuan by the First Special Court on September 12th yesterday.</p>
<h3>Catholic Charity Joins as Child Guardians</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department previously established the Child Protection Section to protect deceived children. Now, to provide more protection for these children, the section recently invited four groups, including the Catholic Charity Association and the Women and Children Relief Association, to negotiate and seek assistance. They also adopted a compassionate attitude, paying attention to the placement of children in various institutions or under the supervision of the concession authorities, so that they would not be isolated and helpless. A new "Volunteer Child Guardian" was established. Each guardian must take care of four or five children. Young men and women with some knowledge of psychology or engaged in education are welcome. The groups strongly support this approach, and their members have joined one after another to increase the well-being of children.</p>
<h3>Children's Health Competition Awards Ceremony</h3>
<p>To promote children's health and raise awareness among parents about their children's bodies, the Shanghai Women's Society held a children's health competition on the 16th of last month.

<h3>Embers Rekindle, Causing a Huge Fire, Investigation Reveals Cause of Fire on Guling Road, Old Servant Arrested and Prosecuted for Causing Disaster</h3>
<p>No. 70 Guling Road is rented by Qian Jichen, who runs a cotton yarn business, so there are often piles of cotton yarn in the house. Shi Chenglang, from Tongzhou, is an old servant hired by Qian. Shi usually burns waste cotton yarn balls to remove the copper pipes from the balls for sale. Therefore, Shi's daily work is almost burning yarn to extract pipes. At 5:00 AM on the 11th of the month, Shi again placed the remaining cotton yarn ashes in a rush bag and placed it at the back door. Beside the bag, there was a large pile of paper. Unexpectedly, the yarn ashes had not been completely extinguished. After being blown by the wind, the embers rekindled and spread to the pile of paper next to it, immediately causing a large fire. With the help of the wind, it turned into a prairie fire, quickly spreading to the two-story loft of the house, where Chen Zubei, a small worker from the Water and Electricity Company, his wife Chen Yu, and their children Chen Qingqing (10 years old), Chen Yuqing (9 years old), and Chen Baobao (7 years old), and daughter Chen Jincai (13 years old) lived. Due to the intense fire, they could not escape in time. Only Chen Yu and Chen Baobao jumped out of the building and escaped. Chen was slightly injured, while Baobao was unharmed. Chen Jindi also escaped after being burned. However, Chen Qingqing and Chen Yuqing both died in the fire. After the fire brigade extinguished the fire, the injured were taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment, and the dead were taken to the autopsy room for examination. Afterwards, Chen Dabao, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station, found out the details and believed that Shi should be held responsible for this fire. However, Shi fled after the incident and was only arrested in Room 75 of the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Albert yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and prosecuted him for causing death by negligence under Articles 276 and 173 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Magistrate Xiao Peishen, he ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for another hearing because it was still necessary to review the autopsy file.</p>

<h3>Protect Our Lives</h3>
<p>—Jun Peng</p>
<p>——Summer is the Season for Active Bacteria——</p>
<p>Time flies, the giant wheels of the era rush forward, and before our eyes is already summer, with the green of the banana trees and the redness of the pomegranates! In this summer, our lives are very dangerous because this period is the time when all pathogenic bacteria are most active. Perhaps you have not forgotten the "salesmen" of all pathogenic bacteria - mosquitoes and flies - they are the executioners of murderers, so protecting our lives is really not to be delayed! In addition, all the major camps of pathogenic bacteria - dirty places - must be cleaned up. We must allow them to live on the isolated islands where people from all directions mix. This year, the population has increased to five or six million, so special attention must be paid to summer hygiene.</p>
<p>Children! You probably all know the saying, "Disease enters through the mouth!" What is most precious to us? It is our lives. So, how can we protect our own lives? Only by paying attention to our own hygiene, which, in other words, means that everything must be clean. We must be extra clean, whether it is on our clothes, utensils, or everything in our homes. If there is any accumulation of dirt, all pathogenic bacteria can immediately parasitize on that thing, and at the same time, they will soon reproduce quickly - their descendants - increasing the executioners of murderers, expanding the major camps of murderers, and with a large number of mosquitoes and flies, taking the opportunity to be active and be their "salesmen." So, at all times, we have the possibility of being invaded by bacteria, which is extremely dangerous! We should know that guns and cannons are very powerful, but we can see them and can also dodge them. Of course, we can temporarily find a safe zone and preserve our lives. Only these pathogenic bacteria cannot be seen by our eyes, so there is no way to avoid them. Assuming that an epidemic occurs in a certain place, it can cause all the people within hundreds of miles around to get sick and die. This is not me scaring you, but the fact is indeed so terrible. We may be living in the atmosphere of the most terrible epidemic (Note). Now, however, science is prospering, so we can take precautions in advance - vaccination, immunization injections - so that even if bacteria come to attack, we will not surrender without resisting, or even die. It is a pity for an individual to die, but if the masses are also like this, wouldn't it be even more pitiful and terrifying? Only with a healthy body can we protect our own lives!</p>
<p>To protect our own lives, we must pay attention to hygiene ourselves. Like the garbage inside the house, it must be swept clean every day; the accumulated dirt on the desks and benches must also be wiped off every day; the things we eat must not be sucked by mosquitoes and flies, so we must cover them well; when we see mosquitoes and flies, we must absolutely exterminate them; we must not buy or eat smelly, rotten, and unclean items casually; we must not eat too much raw and cold food; and it is best not to eat sweets and the like… In short, everything, everything must pay attention to the two words "cleanliness." After our personal lives are guaranteed, the lives of a family can also be guaranteed, and even the lives of the entire nation of a country can be guaranteed. Children! You are the future masters of the country, life is of the utmost importance, quickly start from today, everyone clean up the filth in your homes, exterminate mosquitoes and flies, not only can you strengthen your bodies, but you can also strengthen the country, and the lives of the masses will also be guaranteed! "After a great war, there must be a great epidemic," let us not forget it!</p>
<p>(Note) All infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever are collectively referred to as epidemics.</p>
<h3>Blind and Deaf Children in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>On the streets of Chongqing, on every commemorative day, there are always teams of propagandists giving speeches and singing to the people, but the most eye-catching is a team of blind and deaf children. They were originally students of the "Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf." When Nanjing was about to fall, they, along with tens of thousands of compatriots, walked step by step westward and finally came to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Before the war between China and Japan, there were more than thirty schools for the blind and deaf in the country. Some were founded with personal money, and some were founded by churches. Once the cruel war broke out, they were all closed down, because their school buildings and teaching equipment were all destroyed! Only the Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf was able to continue operating in Chongqing. It is now the only remaining school for the blind and deaf in the country—like a lonely star after dawn.</p>
<p>When this school was in Nanjing, it had two hundred students. Under the daily bombing of Japanese planes, classes were still held as usual until that year (end of 1937) when, as the situation became more and more urgent, the government ordered it to suspend classes and retreat westward. However, due to the lack of transportation, most of the faculty and students did not have time to evacuate Nanjing. Only sixty of them arrived safely in Hankou. After the fall of Nanjing, all the school buildings, including the sewing factory, printing factory, photography room, typesetting room, rattanware manufacturing room, as well as many textbooks for reading, writing, and arithmetic, and various teaching tools, were ruthlessly destroyed.</p>
<p>Before the war, graduates could all find jobs. Most of the blind became teachers and musicians, and most of the deaf became clerks in bookstores, companies, and banks. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Administration once allowed the school to allocate 100,000 silver dollars for the construction of a new school building. Ms. Chiang Soong Mei-ling, the chairman of the China Association for the Prevention of Blindness, also promised to select two blind children from this school to study in the United States. However, all these things, my young friends—is the result of China's War of Resistance victory? Failure? Or peace? Please go and see!</p>
<p>(Made by Ni Changmin) (Charity Sale Donation) were all suspended due to the war.</p>
<p>In June 1938, this school moved to Chongqing and resumed classes. It now has more than sixty students, divided into two classes, one for blind children and one for deaf children. The level ranges from elementary school to junior high school and high school. The curriculum includes Chinese, arithmetic, English, music, history, nature, etc. They are now planning to open a vocational class with an attached factory so that students can receive vocational training.</p>
<p>Their Boy Scouts are currently doing various national salvation works: giving speeches, singing, and soliciting donations for national salvation. Last New Year's Eve, this group of blind and deaf speakers and musicians broadcast on the Central Broadcasting Station.</p>
<p>If you see a group of deaf teenagers who cannot speak on the streets of Chongqing, leading their blind companions, walking along, and when they reach a suitable place, the blind teenagers stand up and promote national salvation to the crowd, how moved would you be!</p>
<p>My young friends—is the result of China's War of Resistance victory? Failure? Or peace? Please go and see! (Charity Sale Donation)</p>

<h3>Having a Meal</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>——Record of Ming'er's Escape – 20——</p>
<p>After spending a night in Yanzhou, when Ming'er woke up from his dream, he realized that it was already dawn. After a while, the sun also emitted strong rays of light high in the sky, but there was no trace of the boatmen on the bow and stern. It was so quiet that nothing was moving. It turned out that they had slept on that big boat last night. Therefore, the Jiangshan boat was still silently resting in the pile of boats, but the refugees in the cabin had already started moving, washing their faces and gargling, doing the work that must be done in the morning. When they had all finished their work, the boatmen came late, and then the boat began to move forward.</p>
<p>In the past few days, you started the boat before dawn, but today, you started so late. Boatman, is it because you slept too comfortably last night? Ming'er asked the boatman, who was standing blankly at the bow and facing his hometown, with a tone of half-blame and half-joking. After Ming'er said this, it reminded him, and he smiled and punted with the bamboo pole. "He is so reluctant to leave his hometown," Ming'er said to himself. At this moment, he heard the sound of breakfast being eaten in the cabin, and he slipped in.</p>
<p>For some reason, Ming'er had a particularly good appetite since he got on the Jiangshan boat. In normal times, he would dislike the three vegetarian dishes, complaining that they were not delicious or refreshing, and he would put down his chopsticks after eating a bowl of rice. But now it was completely different. He could eat almost three bowls in one breath, and sometimes he would add a bite or two. Moreover, the dishes on the boat were not very good, because they had to be prepared by themselves. Ming'er's mother would always ask the boatman if there were any meat or vegetarian dishes for sale in the town. If there were, she would not hesitate to go ashore to buy some, preparing to eat it for two or three days. As a result, each dish had to be kept for two or three days, and the taste was just so-so. But Ming'er didn't dislike the taste at all, and his appetite increased rather than decreased. Not only did he have this phenomenon, but probably everyone in the cabin was like this. Isn't this a strange thing? But it's easy to explain, because in normal times, they mostly used their brains, but now their daily life is either eating and sleeping, or looking at the scenery and chatting, using less brainpower, so of course they eat more than before.</p>
<p>In a narrow corner of the bed, he removed the sheets and put one or two bowls of overnight dishes on the edge of the bed. Ming'er's father took a package and placed it underneath as a stool. The mother sat on the edge of the bed, and Ming'er himself went to fill a bowl of porridge and took a pair of bamboo chopsticks. When he clamped the dish onto the bowl, the porridge soup overflowed from the mouth of the bowl, dripping onto the blanket.</p>
<p>"Why are you so greedy? You can fill it less, and add more after you finish eating, isn't it the same?" his mother said.</p>
<p>"Because I eat very slowly, won't the porridge be filled up by you? Therefore, I have to fill more," these silly words made everyone on the boat laugh. Ming'er said as he walked to the bedding and sat down. His two eyes were fixed on the rice bowl, and he quickly sent the porridge to his mouth with his chopsticks. At this time, he only felt that the sweet and fragrant porridge and delicious dishes were not worth savoring carefully. As soon as the porridge was sent to his mouth, he pushed his tongue to the throat, and the muscles of the throat contracted, and the porridge rolled down. There was a slight burning sensation in his throat, but he didn't feel anything else. He quickly finished a bowl in this gluttonous manner. The sound of "huoluo, huoluo" of eating porridge was probably the loudest in the whole boat. He ate one bowl and then another, and still wanted to add more, but he realized that the bottom of the pot was empty, so he had to put down the bowl and wait quietly for the opportunity to have lunch.</p>
<p>The boatmen carried the boat for about an hour, then retracted the rope and returned to the boat to eat. Ming'er also followed them to the stern. They ate rice in the morning, with only a bowl of green vegetables placed on the deck. Each boatman took a large bowl of rice and swallowed it very refreshingly. Ming'er saw that they were eating so deliciously, and couldn't help but swallow a few mouthfuls of his own saliva. He stopped looking and returned to the bow. Later, Ming'er learned that they had to eat five meals a day, which was not surprising, because they had to walk almost fifty or sixty miles every day.</p>
<p>"Brother, look, they only eat a bowl of vegetables, but they eat a lot of rice, so their bodies are very strong. So, I haven't been eating less these days, my body will probably be like theirs, right?" Ming'er asked his brother, Cong'er, who was reading a book, jokingly.</p>
<h3>An American Child's Travelogue in China</h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>In a certain month of a certain year, at the invitation of my Chinese friend Hua'er, I came to travel in China: When the President Steamer (1) sailed away from the Shoal outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, I saw the huge Construction Dredger (2), which is said to be the second largest dredger in the world. When I arrived in Shanghai (3), the buildings such as the International Hotel were somewhat like the scenery of New York City. Most of the aquatic products (4) along the coast are collected and distributed here; From (3), I first went to Hangzhou (5), visited the world-famous West Lake, and then went to Nanjing to visit Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum (6). Then, I took a train north, and sometimes parallel to and sometimes intersecting with the Jinpu Railway (7) is a Grand Canal (8) opened by manpower. The train passed through Shandong Province and reached Tianjin (9). The fruit (10) production in the Shandong Peninsula is extremely abundant. From (9) to Beijing, I visited the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven (11), etc., and then went to see the eleven-hole long stone bridge—Lugou Bridge (12), and paid tribute to the Great Wall (13), which stretches for two thousand miles and winds through the mountains. Then I went out of the customs to the Northeast, where the soybean (14) production is very high, which can be said to be its first source of wealth. The most abundant minerals are coal and iron, and the gold production is also high (15). The forests (16) are also the most lush in China. With the abundance of forests, wild animals breed, so the production of fur (17) is also extremely high here. From the Northeast through Inner Mongolia to Outer Mongolia, the impression that Mongolia gave me was not the bad impression of the Gobi Desert. There are tens of millions of sheep, horses, cattle, and camels (18, 19), grazing in groups in the grassland, which is a great sight! Most of the Mongolians live in Mongolian yurts (20) made of cowhide. They are very skilled in horsemanship, and the art of falconry (21) can arouse my interest! From Mongolia to Ningxia (22), a famous wool-producing area, and then through Yanchang (23), which is buried with huge amounts of oil, into Henan, the train passed through the 3,000-meter-long Yellow River Railway Bridge (24) and reached Hankou (25). The famous Hanyang Iron Works is just opposite Hankou; From (25), I took a boat (26) westward, passing through Dongting Lake (27), which is a large lake in the Lianghu region, which is very rich in rice (28). The boat passed through the Three Gorges (29) and sailed upstream to Chongqing (30), which is China's new capital after the war. From (30), I took a plane (31) to the Northwest, first passing through Lanzhou (32), which is the center point of China's roads, and its famous product is Pisi cigarettes. Then I went to Hami (33), where the melons are very famous, and apples, pears, grapes, etc. are available all year round. In addition, I also saw the Hetian jade (34); Yaks (35) are produced in southern Xinjiang and Qinghai and Tibet. The milk and meat of this cow are used for food, and the dung is used as fuel. It is a very useful domestic animal. Its head looks like a yellow cow, its body is covered with long hair, its tail is like a horse, but its call is like a pig! Tibet also produces a white bear (36), which is very precious. There are also two of them in the New York Zoo! The southern end of the Tibetan Plateau is the roof of the world—the Himalayas (37). The houses on the plateau are flat and square, like碉樓(38); In Qinghai (39), I saw a kind of fish, which has no scales on its body, so it is called scaleless fish. When traveling in Xikang, I once walked across the cable bridge (40) suspended over the rapids. The parrots (41) in Xikang are numerous and fun. The waterwheels (42) in the Chengdu Basin are flat, round and large. This is the application of hydraulic power in the old method. In addition, Sichuan produces a large number of medicinal materials (43). From Chongqing to Guiyang (44) by road, I saw the Miao dance there, which was very beautiful. After arriving in Kunming (45), I rested for a few days. The most famous minerals in Yunnan are copper and tin (46). Later, I returned to Guilin via Guiyang and visited the local mountains and rivers (47). From there, I went to Guangzhou by water. Guangzhou is the birthplace of the Chinese Revolution, a large port in the south. I visited famous buildings such as: Huanghuagang Cemetery of Revolutionary Martyrs, Zhujiang Bridge, and Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall (48), which can accommodate 10,000 people. The products of Guangdong Province include coconuts (49) from Hainan Island, oranges from Shantou, and sugarcane (50), which are all very famous. After I finished my tour, I bid farewell to my friend Hua'er on the coast of the South China Sea, and took a flying boat from Hong Kong and set off across the Pacific Ocean back to my country. The impression I got from this tour is: "China has a vast land, huge treasures, and inexhaustible manpower. If it can use them to build, it will definitely become a very strong country in the future!"</p>
<p>Little friends: After reading this hypothetical travelogue of an American child in China, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>"You have to know that their strong bodies are mostly due to exercise. If you only eat and don't exercise, your body will grow fat, but the meat on your body is the fat on a pig's body, not muscle. Then you have more fat on your body, are you going to sell it to Lu Gaojian to roast braised pork?" Cong'er replied mischievously, which caused laughter in the cabin again.</p>
<h3>Somersaults</h3>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<p>Doing somersaults is also a beneficial exercise. You can all try it. However, the somersaults I'm talking about are not asking you to somersault in the air like in a circus, but asking you to somersault in bed or on a soft mat.</p>
<p>The posture of doing somersaults is to bend the body into a spherical shape, so the most important thing when doing somersaults is to bend the body, otherwise it will be easy to fall and hurt. There are two driving forces for doing somersaults, one is in the feet, and the other is in the head. There is one fulcrum, which is in the hands. To put it simply, when doing somersaults, the body is bent, the hands are on the ground as a fulcrum; the head is drilled down, and the feet are kicked down, and a somersault will be successfully done for you.</p>
<p>Doing somersaults is not fooling around, but a very noble and beneficial exercise, but you have to learn slowly. If you practice slowly, if you use too much force and fall dizzy, it will be harmful to you.</p>
<p>In ordinary gymnastics, there are very few that put the head below the heart. The characteristic of somersaults lies here. Many people put their heads below their hearts, and they often blush and feel dizzy, because your head blood vessels are not healthy. If you often do this kind of exercise, the head blood vessels can become healthy.</p>
<p>Whether the head blood vessels are healthy or not is not just empty talk. It is very useful to you in daily life. For example, when taking a ship or train, if you do not have healthy head blood vessels, you will feel dizzy, which is the so-called "seasickness" or "train sickness". If you take a plane, the bumps are even more severe. You will have many opportunities to take ships and planes in the future. If you practice somersaults often now, it will be very beneficial to you.</p>
<p>If you feel dizzy when you somersault lightly, it is due to physical reasons. You can practice step by step, and you will not be dizzy in the future. Dizziness caused by collisions is harmful, and dizziness caused by light somersaults is not important.</p>
<p>Letter from the Editor: Mr. Editor: We are very honored that you published our crude manuscripts. Now we see that there are many manuscripts for charity sales in the newspaper. Although we are elementary school students, we dare not lag behind others in our enthusiasm for saving the country. We are willing to take the two manuscript fees that we have already published in the journal as charity sale donations (1. Black Cat and Flower Cat, 2. The Autobiography of a Swing). We also hope that you will correct our future manuscripts. I wish you a healthy pen. Sincerely, Qi Jinmei and Zhang Zude, students of Zhendong Elementary School, May 4th.</p>
<h3>In the Realm of Beasts (1)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Peng Qi was a bad boy. His original name was Peng Qiming, but everyone called him Peng Qi, which was clearly a homophone of Peng Qi. His face was often unclear, as if covered with a layer of clouds, or like a blackboard that had not been wiped clean. Some people said it was because he didn't wash his face thoroughly.</p>
<p>Children are originally good, and there is no such thing as good or bad. Even if they are mischievous, it is common. As long as you are patient until they grow up, they will no longer be mischievous. If a child is smart and clever and not mischievous when he is young, it is naturally like a treasure, which is most pleasing.</p>
<p>Children are naturally fond of collecting, and they also like to destroy, so their small rooms are like a warehouse of bamboo heads, wood scraps, broken copper, scrap iron, and miscellaneous goods. Some things seem completely useless, but sometimes they are very useful. For example, if you want a copper wire or electric wire, or a flower pot is broken, a bird cage is broken, or the handle of some daily necessities is broken, and you want to find something of the same quality to repair it, you only need to go to the children's room to find it, and you can always find it. The things in between are as complicated as a department store, a piece of wax, a building block, or an empty box for watercolor paints, everything is there. Peng Qi's room is of course the same, but there are slight differences.</p>
<p>Also, children's games are varied. In addition to some proper and beneficial games, some are simply close to pranks. In general, boys often kick and beat animals, make fun of smaller children, and ridicule women. They gather a group of like-minded friends and do these tricks together, thinking it is very interesting. Peng Qi is one of them, and he likes to make friends with those low-class bad boys and mess around together all day long. Looking at his own appearance, he is not really low-class. If he were scrubbed with hot water and soap, he would be a young gentleman.</p>
<p>Peng Qi's worst temper is that he likes to abuse animals. He doesn't abuse them unintentionally, nor does he treat it as a game, nor does he vent his anger because he is occasionally unhappy. He really thinks that it is the happiest thing to abuse other things and watch them suffer. It is clear that he was born with this cruel nature, and there is no way to change it.</p>
<p>Peng Qi has two younger sisters, both younger than him. He has always looked down on them. The two of them are a pair of beautiful and gentle little things. Other children like to play with them, especially on school holidays, when they have nothing to do, and having the two of them as companions, they don't feel lonely at all. But Peng Qi only likes to make friends with low-class bad boys, so of course he won't pay attention to his two sisters. He thinks that ball games and all other sports are unconscious. Although his family's garden is well maintained by his two sisters when he is studying at school, he has never moved his hands to plant a flower or a grass. As for reading, writing, and studying natural science, he doesn't care about them at all.</p>
<h3>Motherly Love (2)</h3>
<p>— Te Ye</p>
<p>Julian: You should let… let us go, Mom. Mom: You! Li Jiade, you can't go either! Can you imagine what I feel about you in my heart? With parted lips, sleeping next to me, the sound of his breathing lingering in my ears, I know that the happiness of his body and soul belongs to me.</p>
<p>Dad: My love, that was a long time ago...</p>
<p>Mom: No, Li Jiade, everything is right in front of me; just like you, Andrelai, always muttering in your mouth, never at peace, a naughty child, but with a rather clever face, not like you're so old. I walk with you in the garden, putting my hand on your shoulder, as if leaning on you. And you, George, still always climbing trees, do you remember how I always used iodine on your countless scraped skin every night?</p>
<p>Julian: What's the point of talking about these things? Mom, these tasteless..."</p>
<p>Mom: What's the point? You know this is exactly what I can't understand. These tasteless words, I feel are much more important than your fighting. Those trivial things, in my opinion, are worth a whole world. Ever since you had a smattering of knowledge, you have all slipped out of my palms in your speech and expressions. Why? Why? Since ancient times, it has always been the mother who has exhausted her life's blood for you to grow up well.</p>
<p>Grandfather: Don't be angry with them, daughter-in-law.</p>

<h3>Finance: Buying Trend Unlikely to Last, Cash Uptrend Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash Shanghai Clearing House (SHCH) dark market situation fluctuated within a commonplace range. However, the market sentiment was firm and rising, as a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop (mostly acting on behalf of the local gang) competed to absorb purchases. In addition, a certain bank also followed suit, resulting in a prosperous situation. The intra-day high reached 2,129 yuan. Afterwards, due to the silver shop gang taking the opportunity to sell at high prices, and money changers continuing to sell, it fell back slightly. However, the result was still a rise of 3 yuan. Transactions were sluggish, with only about 500 taels in the morning. There were no transactions in the afternoon. There were no changes in silver shop gold ornaments. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also reversed from falling to rising.</p>
<p>SHCH rose by 3 yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened 3 yuan higher due to the double buying trend of a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop (both acting on behalf of the local gang). Then, a certain gold shop entered 50 taels each from peers and silver shop gangs, priced at 2,125 yuan. Soon, a certain silver shop also entered 50 taels from the gold shop at the same price. Following this, it also entered 50 taels from the money exchange industry, priced at 27 yuan. At this time, a certain gold shop also followed suit and entered 50 taels each from the silver shop gang and the money exchange industry, with the same price. In an instant, a certain bank also competed to absorb, so the price was raised by 2 yuan. It is estimated that a certain bank entered 40 taels from the silver shop gang, priced at 29 yuan. Later, a certain silver shop also entered 50 taels from peers at the same price. After this, the buying interest turned weak, and the money exchange industry continued to sell, so the market moved downward, falling by 3 yuan in an instant. The money exchange industry mutually transacted 50 taels, priced at 26 yuan. Later, at noon, the money exchange industry sold another 50 taels to a certain gold shop, priced at 25 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the foreign exchange market being closed on Saturday, people's minds were idle. It was heard that the buyer called 25 yuan, but because the sellers had no intention of supplying, and those who entered did not want expensive prices, there were no transactions for half a day. If calculated at the noon closing price of 2,125 yuan, the result was a rise of 3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. The selling price of the current cash shop's own brand gold was 2,130 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,120 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Ornamental gold remains at the original price</p>
<p>The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael has not changed. Da Tongxing still maintains the original price of 215 yuan, and Xin Tongxing is 213 yuan, with a purchase price of 207 yuan.</p>
<p>British pure gold rebounds</p>
<p>London telegram on the 12th: British pure gold rebounded by half a penny due to the weakening of the British pound, with each ounce being 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Central Bank of China's cash purchase price also rose to 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold also rose by 2 li, amounting to 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard bid gold price also rose by 3 jiao, amounting to 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Spot Rates Steady, Futures Tightening, Swap Rates Widening Due To This, At 8.5% Monthly Interest</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw strong buying interest from major foreign firms and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) (acting for the Tianjin group), as well as Chinese banks in Guangdong. Foreign banks, including British and American banks, were reluctant to supply spot exchange, while the willingness to supply futures suddenly weakened. This resulted in a situation where spot rates were stable, and futures were soft, causing swap rates to gradually widen. At noon, the swap rate for spot against July delivery was 1.40625 British pounds for the British gold and 3.4375 US dollars for the US dollar, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of approximately 8.6% (this month calculated as half a month). Trading was brisk throughout the morning. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate saw little fluctuation due to balanced supply and demand, and the outcome was unchanged.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London telegraphic transfer rates for both near and far dates contracted by 0.0625. The price of silver in New York remained unchanged. The price of gold in London rose by half a penny. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars were slightly lower, and against Shanghai and France remained stable. The exchange rates for US dollars against British pounds and Shanghai remained stable, and against France fell by 0.0625. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 8 pence and 25/100ths for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged from the previous close. After opening, major foreign firms competed to absorb spot British gold at 8 pence and 25/100ths from HSBC and Chartered Bank, and then spot US dollars at 16.0625 yuan from American banks. Because supply and demand were balanced, there was little change. When HSBC's listed rates were announced, they were unchanged. After the announcement of the silver equalization tax, which was a small 2.5%, calculated at 5.25%, a Chinese bank in Guangdong bought July delivery British gold from HSBC at 8 pence and 25/100ths. Subsequently, Chinese banks traded June delivery US dollars at 15.9375 yuan. Later, a British bank (acting for the Tianjin group) also bought August delivery British gold at 8 pence and 625/10000ths from foreign banks. Foreign banks then traded August delivery US dollars at 15.71875 yuan. This made the market stable with a slight downward trend. Near noon, there was only Hong Kong dollar trading. Chartered Bank sold spot Hong Kong dollars to money changers at 55.5 yuan. The situation was stable and unchanged. By the afternoon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 8 pence and 25/100ths for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, similar to the morning opening. The Hong Kong dollar was at 55.5 yuan. As a result, the British, American, and Hong Kong dollar exchange rates were all unchanged compared to the previous evening's close. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday's report stated that the American Express Bank had sold spot US dollars to foreign firms at 16.0625 and 16.09375 yuan. According to a letter from the bank, no such transaction occurred.</p>

Later, money changers took advantage of the high prices to sell, and market prices stabilized. The outcome was a slight increase from the previous day. Local Chinese firms have been active recently, with unabated buying. There was no trading in the afternoon. The supply and demand for British and American gold pounds was even. Trading in British and American gold notes was brisk. British gold notes were slightly firmer. Demand for French franc notes increased slightly, and the price rose. Demand for Annam notes was rare, and market prices continued to decline. There was no trading at the guild. Yesterday's market prices: British gold notes up 1 fen, French franc notes up 2.5 hao, Annam notes down 2 fen. Other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Premium for Bank Drafts Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, the market has seen increased premiums due to high demand for bank drafts. In the past two days, due to the supply-demand ratio, premiums have been increasing, reaching a maximum of 1.5 yuan and a minimum of around 5 jiao. For example, yesterday's premium was 1.25 yuan, meaning it required 1001.25 yuan in banknotes to obtain a 2000 yuan bank draft.</p>

<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Slightly Lower; Sino-Belgian-American Dollar Bonds to Be Drawn on June 1st</h3>
<p>The securities grey market saw slightly volatile market conditions yesterday. The situation of circling and swirling for two weeks has been opened up slightly. The bulls have been making strenuous efforts to raise prices, but were unable to change the environment. Those with shaky grips started to waver. The opening price was stable. Although Tiansheng, Lianhe, Yongkang, Tongkang, Xingyuan, and No. 49 and other bonds were successively sold, No. 20 showed very strong interest, and No. 35 and No. 41 also bought a considerable amount. The market still didn't break out of the circling situation. The ups and downs were extremely minor. In the afternoon, Xingyuan, Tongkang, Songmao, Renchang, Yongkang, and retail investors all sold, while No. 20 stopped buying. Only Shuntai, Dafeng, and Xieda bought. Lianhe also slightly made up for losses. The supply on the table was already greater than the demand, so it decreased slightly by 2 to 2.5 jiao. As a result, the market price decreased slightly by 2 jiao to 0.5 yuan. The total volume was 670,000 yuan. The concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>| Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>

<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of the Chinese Merchants' Stock Exchange were traded at a price of 30.02 yuan, slightly higher than before.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association reported that trading was quite smooth during the week. The closing price yesterday was slightly calm. The share price rose. The various stocks for which many had made profits were absorbed by the market. Plantation stocks were more active. Buyers and sellers traded between 7 and 8 yuan. Jardine Matheson shares were stable at a price of 36.5 yuan. Yessung shares and Ruirong shares have been neglected recently after their recent sharp rise. Jardine Matheson shares were selling at 18.8 yuan, and Kailan shares were firm at a price of 27.75 yuan, with hopes for good interim dividends. Company bonds were dim. Electricity 5.5% bonds were selling at 89.5 yuan, and China Industry 8% bonds were selling at 59 taels. The rubber stock market was quiet. Operators adopted a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the meeting of the Rubber Restriction Production Committee next week. According to the recent sharp reduction in rubber inventory, it is expected that the production amount must be increased by at least 5% to avoid excessive inventory shortages in the coming months. British rubber inventory is expected to decrease by more than 1100 tons this week.</p>
<p>London British Far East company stocks listed prices on the 12th of this month (Friday): HSBC British registered shares fell by 1 pound, the price was 84 pounds, and the rest were unchanged. Chinese foreign debt listed prices on the 12th of this month (Friday): the debts were stable and unchanged.</p>

<h3>Japanese Debt in England: High Interest, Low Market Price; Credit Inferior to China</h3>
<p>London, 12th dispatch, the prices of various Chinese bonds in the London market were the same as the previous day, without any changes, while the prices of Japanese bonds, except for the 6% bonds of 1924, which remained unchanged at 44 pounds, the 5% bonds issued in 1907 fell by 0.75 pounds (that is, 15 shillings), the price was 36.25 pounds (that is, 36 pounds and 5 shillings). It can be seen that the price of the 4.5% British-German supplementary loan bonds issued in 1898 was 67.5 pounds, the price of the 4.5% British-French bonds issued in 1908 was 61 pounds, and the price of the 5% goodwill bonds was 52 pounds. The prices of all bonds are higher than Japanese bonds. The interest rate of Japanese bonds is 6% and 5%, while the interest rate of Chinese bonds is only 4.5% and 5%. The high interest and low price of Japanese bonds show that the credit of Chinese foreign debt is higher than that of Japanese debt. (A)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Focus on the "Angel" and "Double Horse" Brands; Odd Lot Yarn Sold at Surprisingly Low Prices; Japanese Yarn Also Stagnant</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been rising for many days, was sluggish yesterday due to slow real demand. General operators were also less active than before. As for the industry, some had already sold out their large amounts and had no intention of going long for the time being, and had to wait for it to fall back before absorbing again. However, a certain yarn firm was still carrying huge amounts, so their views on whether to go long or short differed. In short, if real sales are strong, the market price will naturally rise; if transactions are clear, the selling will ease. This situation is relatively smooth; otherwise, suddenly raising or suppressing prices will not benefit the reality at all. Observing the market situation, all parties are also waiting for the environment to change before making a decision. However, the price of 20-count yarn from odd lots is too low. The selling price of 20-count "Five Sons" yarn is only 395 yuan, which is about 40 yuan cheaper than the "Double Horse" price. Moreover, this yarn is also an old brand. Why is it so low? It is really because business is not smooth.</p>
<p>At the morning opening of spot yarn, there was no movement in customer sales. Hong Kong brokers were idle, and most predicted that prices would fall back a small step. However, the industry bought 30 bales of 20-count "Double Horse" spot goods at a price of 434 yuan, similar to the previous day's price. The price of warehouse receipts was generously lowered by 2 or 3 yuan. In a short while, the price of spot goods only went to 428 yuan, and the price of warehouse receipts also went to 420 yuan. In the afternoon, because Hong Kong brokers slightly needed fine yarn, the market situation rose. The spot price of 20-count "Double Horse" rose by 3 yuan, to 433 yuan. The price of warehouse receipts also went to 423.5 yuan. As a result, 682 bales were traded in the morning, with sluggish selling prices. 510 bales were traded in the afternoon, with rising market prices. A total of 1192 bales were traded in the two markets, with the price of 20-count "Double Horse" down 5 jiao from the previous day, "Shepherd" down 5 jiao, "Double Globe" down 5 jiao, and the rest were unchanged. However, 32-count "Angel" and "Double Horse" rose by 4 or 5 yuan. The amounts bought by each group are listed on the left: Industry 600, Shantou 3, Fujian 30, Tianjin 20, Hong Kong 245, Yunnan 55, Mainland 17, Xiamen 15, total 1192.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market remained sluggish, but the market situation showed a more volatile trend. The price of 20-count "Moon Harp" was 368 yuan on the agricultural side, rising by 2 yuan at noon to a price of 370 yuan, equal to the price of the previous day. A large batch of Indian cotton will arrive tomorrow.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Short Covering, Near-Term Prices Rise Alone; Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrives Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market was very sluggish yesterday. At the morning opening, because trading was quiet, market prices fell by 3-5 points. Although the price slightly firmed in the middle due to telegrams from Liverpool and India raising prices, the inventory in the spot market was not thick. Those long on May delivery were expected to receive the most goods. Short sellers desperately covered, so May delivery rose by 11 points alone. Far-term prices all fell by 2-3 points. India was unusually strong. Yesterday, together with the forecast, it rose by 1 rupee again. However, last night, a telegram was received from India that the opening price rose by 2 rupees again. Egypt rose by 3-5 points. Converted to legal currency, the price of American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 2 jiao per picul, the price of Indian cotton rose by 4 jiao, and the price of Egyptian cotton rose by 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: foreign cotton prices have been rising sharply for several days, and the factories have had no trading. However, the industry has been very interested in buying. In recent days, they have already bought more than 10,000 bales of Brazilian cotton. The details were reported earlier. Yesterday, they ordered another 2,000 pieces of Brazilian cotton, to be shipped in July, with a price of 84 yuan for warehouse delivery. Pingguo'er also ordered 1,000 pieces yesterday, with a price of 61 yuan. The converted factory prices for yesterday's cotton market are listed below:</p>
<p>| Raw Material Category | Factory Price Including Tax |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| 60-count Egyptian Cotton | |</p>
<p>| High Grade | 110.540 |</p>
<p>| Middle Grade | 102.45 |</p>
<p>| 80-count Egyptian Cotton | |</p>
<p>| High Grade | 135.85 |</p>
<p>| Middle Grade | 125.40 |</p>
<p>| 20-count American Mitlin | 90.20 |</p>
<p>| Lower Grade | 77.00 |</p>
<p>| 32-count American Mitlin | 99.00 |</p>
<p>| Lower Grade | 90.10 |</p>
<p>| 42-count American Mitlin | 100.90 |</p>
<p>| Lower Grade | 88.75 |</p>
<p>| South American Brazilian Cotton | |</p>
<p>| High Grade | 88.55 |</p>
<p>| Middle Grade | 86.35 |</p>
<p>| Lower Grade | 83.00 |</p>
<p>| 10-count Indian Pingguo'er | 65.45 |</p>
<p>| 16-count Indian Omarra | 71.80 |</p>
<p>| 20-count Indian Bailuoqu | 77.40 |</p>
<p>| 24-count Indian Kangbodi | 83.40 |</p>
<p>| 32-count American Xinte | 87.00 |</p>
<p>| 32/42-count American Pengjiapu | 91.55 |</p>
<p>A large amount of Indian cotton will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The British Company-managed Barom Relhavaea is coming from Karachi with 33,000 bales of cotton, and the Jeypora is also coming from there with 6,010 bales of cotton. Both are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (Monday). The location for berthing is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>The sluggishness of Chinese cotton business is rare in history. There is no market to report and it is completely stagnant. The industry and factories have not traded even one bale. The scarcity of goods and the hoarding of goods by holders have made it difficult for both parties to reach an agreement. However, the converted price of foreign cotton is calm, and all parties are ordering it. The bleak future of Chinese cotton is very worrying. The supply from Northern Jiangsu is also subject to various constraints, and the arrival of goods is meager, only 57 bales.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw White Rises by 6 Jiao</h3>
<p>The World Sugar Production and Sales Conference is being held in London this week. In the previous few days, the consumer side's proposal requested Cuba (the production area) to increase exports by 200,000 tons to supply the free market. This caused speculators to sell off, but now it is heard that this proposal has not been passed, so the London sugar market has suddenly reversed and risen. Yesterday's telegram: August delivery rose by 4.25 pence, to 7 shillings, 5 pence and 35/100ths; December delivery rose by 3.75 pence, to 6 shillings and 5 pence; March delivery next year rose by 3.75 pence, to 6 shillings and 6 pence. This caused the guild's cut-off market situation to suddenly tighten. The spot price of 24 raw white sugar was 27.7 yuan for the local warehouse and 27.5 yuan for the foreign warehouse, up 6 jiao. Transit goods were first 19.4 yuan, trading 1,000 bags, and then rose to 19.6 yuan, trading 200 bags. Taikoo sugar also slightly rose. B mark was first 27.35 yuan, trading 200 bags, and then 27.4 yuan, trading 400 bags. CW was 27.3 yuan, CX 27 yuan, DY 26.8 yuan, HX 26.7 yuan. However, the Hong Kong telegram was unchanged. The domestic sugar market situation also improved, and the Chaozhou group opened more than 100 bags of foot three-tipped white sugar at a price of 25.5 to 25.4 yuan. Yesterday, 115 bags of sugar arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, and another 3,840 bags were shipped from Shantou.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Price of Green Bamboo Shoots Tend to Ease</h3>
<p>There are still continued arrivals of green bamboo shoots these days, and the market situation is gradually easing. Fatty bamboo shoots are down 3 jiao, to 1.9 yuan. Bald bamboo shoots are down 2 jiao, to 1.8 yuan. Bamboo shoot skins once fell to 75 yuan, but now they have returned to 80 yuan. It is heard that the production price has turned strong, and there is a danger of turning upside down.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Trading Is Brewing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market seemed to be gradually rising from stability. Japanese and American silk prices each showed a firm phenomenon. Yokohama spot prices rose by 18 yuan, and forward prices rose by 31 yuan. New York Japanese silk prices each rose by 2 fen. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk also rose by 2 fen along with them. The exchange's near-term sold the original plate, and the far-term September rose by 2.5 fen.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, both buyers and sellers are waiting for developments. The current situation is not yet mutually deadlocked. Foreign firms and manufacturers are in contact every day, but because the prices of the two parties differ by as much as 30 yuan, there has been no transaction. Yesterday, Indian and African Zhuangkou were both reported to be sluggish, but silk prices did not tend to fall back, because the current situation is that the inventory of silk and cocoons is limited, silk factories have stopped working night shifts, and the measures for collecting cocoons and transporting new native silk to Shanghai have not yet been resolved. This has delayed the launch of new silk trading, and forward silk prices are also trending upward. 222 pieces of Huzhou silk, 46 pieces of silk waste, and 1,310 boxes of tea were all shipped to Europe the day before yesterday (the 12th).</p>
<h3>Coal: Coke Plummets; Charcoal Can Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The coke industry has seen depressed trading recently due to the closure of many foundry operations in the city and the accumulation of inventory. As a result, the market price has plummeted, falling by 30 yuan compared to the previous month. Stockpilers are also selling off in large quantities to avoid further losses. Yesterday, the underground market only opened at 120 yuan per ton, and there were no buyers.</p>
<p>The import of 10,000 baskets of charcoal was reported yesterday. The shipping company said that the ship was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday but will now arrive at 7:00 AM this morning. Therefore, the 10,000 baskets of charcoal mentioned in yesterday's report will arrive today.</p>
<h3>Metals: White Lead Sheet Asking Price Softens</h3>
<p>The white lead sheet market had a sense of undersupply, with shortages, but the factories ordered more than 400 drums from overseas, which have now arrived. The long-quiet white lead sheet market has suddenly revived, but selling is slightly down due to abundant supply. No. 2 is selling for 250 yuan per drum, No. 2 for 245 yuan, No. 4 for 245 yuan, No. 5 for 235 yuan, No. 6 for 212 yuan, No. 7 for 100 yuan, No. 8 for 215 yuan, and No. 9 and 10 for 332 yuan, down 1-2 yuan from before. Buyers are from Tianjin, Qingdao, tea merchants, etc. Battery factories in this street are also doing some slight buying.</p>
<h3>Imported and Exported Soda Ash Comes from Tianjin</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 700 bags of soda ash were imported from Tianjin, as well as 3,000 cases of fresh eggs, and 250 cases from Northern Sha. The day before yesterday, 79 cases of egg yolk white and 9 cases of sausage casings were shipped to Europe.</p>

<h3>Grains: Underground Rice Prices Emerge Repeatedly; Chang Group Japonica Opens at 16.5 Yuan; Regular Indica Now Filled with Medium-Quality Subordinates</h3>
<p>Dumi: Yesterday, all groups' sources were not arriving from He Xia, and only slightly over 1,000 packages of car wheel buns arrived. The source of supply is becoming increasingly scarce. It is heard that this is caused by soaring raw prices in the interior, transportation disruptions, and blockages. The market situation is even more chaotic, with underground prices emerging everywhere, which has become an open secret. It is heard that Chang japonica has opened at 16.5 yuan, Xi japonica has opened at 16.3 yuan, and Su-Tong japonica has opened at 15.7-16.0 yuan. Bo Dao or Si-Jing goods have also opened at 15.7-16.0 yuan, and there are also conservatives who limit Bo japonica. However, most of them are predetermined goods, so this divergence seems to betray the Rice Industry Association's painstaking efforts to limit prices. As for the continued filling of customer-pointed goods with high-quality goods, Ruomi has opened at 13.85 yuan, up 3-4 jiao. Foreign Du-pointed rice has not been seen on the market. The price of Yuan rice is already high, and it is further crowded out by foreign glutinous rice, so it remains at its original plate. Hong Kong glutinous rice opened at 19.8-19.5 yuan. In short, this divergence is that the weight of each good is heavier, which is not scarce, but low-priced goods are also quite numerous. Therefore, indiscriminately setting underground prices seems to be manipulative. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the responsible authorities will value the people's food and take remedial measures, such as unblocking sources.</p>
<p>Customer Indica: Yesterday, it was stimulated by the high underground prices of japonica rice, and the situation became even more tense. The situation in Wuhu's producing area is unclear, and the cargo side is willing to try to recover losses. The source of supply of car wheels has decreased. There are rumors of a 14.4-4.5 yuan underground price for Gao Wuhu indica on the market, and 14.7-4.4 yuan for Jing indica, but none of them can be proven. The officially traded Wuhu indica on the market at 14-13.7 yuan is instead filled with medium-grade goods, Ruomi is also at 13.7 yuan, and rough rice is at 12.6-7 yuan, up 2-3-4 jiao from the previous day. Although there is no confirmation of foreign rice orders, there is a possibility of approaching, so Xigong retail is still only 19 yuan. Foreign Yuan rice continues to be processed, but high-quality foreign Yuan rice also requires 19.8-19.5 yuan. Yesterday, 1,130 bags of rice were imported from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Continue to Handle Local Wheat; Three Ships of Australian Wheat Arrive Successively; Flour Remains Weak as Before</h3>
<p>The flour market remains weak as before. The Beiyang group is still being crowded out by local foreign flour, and the Tianjin flour market is small, making it difficult to transport, so buying is sluggish. The Nanyang group is seeing slightly more active new trading because their stored flour has already been loaded out, but the amount is limited. Each factory, in view of the difficulty in activating customer sales, still maintains its original plate and is unwilling to loosen it quickly. The total trading volume in the unified market is less than 30,000 bags. About half are sold by the local street and inland groups, and the rest are handled by customer groups.</p>
<p>Wheat sources: recently, goods from the Yangtze River inland area have been arriving one after another. At this time when foreign wheat orders are pouring in, factories are sluggish in buying. Only Japanese merchants are buying, and the market is still weak. I, then, at the 1 yuan mark, still have difficulty standing firm. Yesterday, it was heard that Japanese merchants secretly continued to handle a total of about 2,000 packages of wheat from Jiangbei and Changxi, at a price of 6.5-6.45 yuan. It is rumored that the wheat is also transferred to flour factories in North China for flour production. As for the local flour factories' receiving plate, 6.3 yuan is still considered expensive.</p>
<p>A large number of foreign wheat are arriving one after another. The Llandaff, managed by the British-owned Baohe Foreign Company, which was carrying wheat from Australia, was originally scheduled to arrive on the 14th, but according to the company, it arrived ahead of schedule the day before yesterday (the 12th), carrying a total of 8,100 tons of wheat, docking at Qichang warehouse in Pudong to unload. Also, the British Company's Trehata, also carrying 8,076 tons of wheat from Australia, was imported yesterday, temporarily berthed at buoy No. 12, and is scheduled to be transferred to the Huafeng Factory wharf today. Also, the Ridley, managed by Jardine Matheson, is also carrying 8,000 tons of Australian wheat and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cakes; Soybean Oil Planned to Come Again; Once High Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market continued to rise in the atmosphere of the previous day, because Dalian reported price increases again and again. Those close to Japanese merchants heard that a bullish company was secretly established, intending to create an unprecedented high price of 2.0. Therefore, Dalian oil opened at 38.7 yuan, once reached 39 yuan, and finally closed at 38.8 yuan, trading over 330 barrels. Other Jiaozhou oil opened 100 pieces at 27 yuan, and Lianqi big basket 150 pieces opened at 36 yuan, rising to 36.6 yuan, and Dalian Fengnian oil 70 pieces opened at 37.7 yuan, rising to 38.2 yuan.</p>
<p>It was found that 590 pieces of soybean oil came from Tianjin yesterday, 939 pieces from Qingdao, and 820 cans, and 300 pieces of raw oil came from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Visible Improvement in Spot Sales of White Cloth; Possible New Purchasing by the Wenzhou Group; Domestic Cloth</h3>
<p>The market is stable, largely because both cotton yarn and eastern textiles are trending towards a cyclical pattern. Spot sales of white goods are brisk, with the Guangdong group initiating purchases previously, and now the Wenzhou group from eastern Zhejiang is showing a tendency to follow suit. Yesterday, they gathered over a hundred bales of cheap, readily available coarse cloth from Ewo (Jardine Matheson), while another firm, believing that Ewo's wholesale prices were too high and inflexible, has also been continuously buying up 200 bales in the market over the past few days. As a result, the tone for readily available coarse cloth has tightened. The Guangdong group continued to purchase 50-60 bales of fine cloth, fine twill, and drill cloth for local dyeing and small wholesale business in local and other ports, completing transactions for nearly a hundred pieces of Shenxin, Ewo, Dasheng, and miscellaneous drill and fine cloths. Over 5,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, striped bleached cloth, poplin, printed cloth, and linen yarn were sold. The Anhui group bought 20-30 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and drill cloth. The Sichuan-Yunnan group additionally purchased over a hundred cases of colored cloth, colored twill, and printed bleached cloth. The Guangdong group continued to buy over fifty cases of bleached and dyed fine cloth, twill, and poplin. The Tianjin-Yantai group from the north also bought a small quantity, about 40-50 cases, of bleached cloth, poplin, and colored cloth. The day before yesterday, twenty-six pieces of textiles were shipped to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Eastern Textiles</p>
<p>Yesterday, the selling prices for fine cloth and fine twill remained firm as before. However, high-end fine cloth, especially the "Color Ball" and "Dragon Head" brands, saw a further price increase of 5 to 10 cents per bolt due to strong demand. Spot goods were priced at $13.95, and next month's futures at $14.05. Northern merchants made some purchases, with transactions totaling approximately 300 bales of various brands of fine cloth. Local demand was moderate, with 500-600 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill being purchased. The prices of colored "Four Gentlemen" broadcloth and tribute satin were affected by sluggish actual sales, and prices have also declined. Spot goods from individual sellers were offered at 44 cents per yard.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Peanut Kernel Prices Firm Up Again</h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Due to renewed purchases by foreign firms, the market for peanut kernels has strengthened. The price of southwest kernels rose 20 cents to $14.80, while the price of east kernels rose to $15, and large kernels to $15.30. Western and Eastern firms, as well as oil mills, purchased 9,000 bags. Peanut prices are stable, with Jardine Matheson buying 2,100 bags at $13. The current stock of Qingdao peanut kernels is over 40,000 bags, and peanuts are over bags. Yesterday, 3,300 bags of peanuts arrived from Weihaiwei, as well as 200 bags of peanut kernels.</p>

<h3>"Import Surplus Figures" Are Shocking</h3>
<p>— A Current Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday's local news in this newspaper carried a headline: "Although Trade in Shanghai is Gradually Recovering, Import Surplus Figures Are Shocking," with a sub-headline stating: "While the government is striving to eliminate the import surplus, this is something that all Shanghai residents should feel ashamed about." Indeed, the shocking "import surplus figures" in Shanghai are something that we five million residents of Shanghai, especially the propertied citizens, should feel "ashamed" of!</p>
<p>Shanghai is not only the political and economic center of China (although it has now lost some of its importance, it undoubtedly still has some uses), but also an important international metropolis. People like to describe this young metropolis as "the Paris of the East," which shows just how extravagant and dissolute this sinful place has become! With such an "Oriental Paris" coupled with its "Oriental Destiny," it is no surprise that its "import surplus figures" are rising year by year, and there is nothing to be astonished about!</p>
<p>However, "Oriental Destiny" is not "immutable." The shackles around its neck are suffocating it. Following the angry roar of the suddenly awakened "sleeping lion," this "Oriental Paris" was once thought to be "doomed." People became uneasy about this "Oriental Paris," and although its loyal children were protecting it, some people fled from it.</p>
<p>Like a dream, this "Oriental Paris" soon regained its former glory. People forgot the wounds in their hearts and the uneasiness they had felt towards this "Oriental Paris." Now, that feeling has changed into a joyful cry of "Shanghai is indeed a blessed land!" They forgot that Shanghai is in a rapid and inevitable process of change within the overall "Oriental Destiny," and they seem to have also forgotten that Shanghai is surrounded by terrors that constantly threaten people. Forgotten, all is forgotten. In Shanghai, following the rapid changes in "Oriental Destiny," they still have the heart to display a "Parisian attitude." As a result, the import surplus for the first quarter of this year was 47,578,000 yuan, an increase of 28,471,000 yuan compared to 19,100,700 yuan in the same quarter last year. Because the customs have changed hands, it is self-evident what kind of goods account for the majority of imports!</p>
<p>Is this not something for the people of Shanghai to be "ashamed" of? However, this "shame" should still be borne by the propertied class, because for the poor people in Shanghai, the problem of just "living" is already enough to make them sigh a hundred times a day. What energy do they have left to buy the "goods" they want but cannot afford? Therefore, the problem still requires wealthy friends to be more "frugal"! If you ask "why?", then the answer is very simple: "Saving the country is also saving yourself and your descendants!" (Auction for Charity)</p>
<h3>Clear Skies After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: A Respectable Mother with a Bun and a Blue Skirt; A Vigorous Old Man with Silver Beard and Green Sleeves</p>
<p>Let's talk about Village Chief Zhu of Freedom Village. He established many remedial schools to teach people to catch up on their studies. It didn't matter if they were male or female, or even if they were older. Especially in winter, because farmers had a little more free time then. Freedom Village also built an assembly hall, which served several purposes. Any village meetings or gatherings of villagers would naturally be held in this hall. For example, if a celebrity came, Village Chief Zhu would invite them to give a lecture in the hall. Furthermore, any public celebrations or commemorative events would often be held in the assembly hall as well. The Freedom Village Elementary School was right next door to the assembly hall. With such a new village and with the advocacy of someone as well-known as Zhu Laoyuan, it was not difficult for Freedom Village to flourish. But Village Chief Zhu was a simple man. Other towns were becoming increasingly prosperous, with all kinds of entertainment. Freedom Village didn't even have a movie theater. If a traveling troupe or film education group rarely came, they would mostly perform in the assembly hall. There was a park, and it was quite large, but there were very few buildings in the park. There were wide expanses of grass and a planting area so that children could learn about various plants. Village Chief Zhu's own residence was not far from the elementary school, just three bungalows, completely in the style of a rural cottage. In front of the door was an open space, surrounded by a woven bamboo fence, with two low doors. Just inside the entrance was a grape trellis, to provide shade in the summer. Village Chief Zhu would move a bamboo couch under the grape trellis in the cool evenings of summer, bare his feet, open his chest, and sit with his legs apart, enjoying the cool air. Or he would invite a few old friends to talk about the past and the present. He had no other hobbies, except that he occasionally liked to drink three cups of wine when he was in the mood. The wine was not expensive, and he didn't need any foreign brandy or whiskey, or even any famous Chinese wine. He only drank homemade "Du brew," which his daughter-in-law, the Madam, could make herself. She often made it as a filial offering to her father-in-law, for him to enjoy whenever he needed it. Behind his cottage, there was also an open space. Facing his cottage, a three-room, one-story building had been built, but it was not elaborately constructed. Now, Madame Zhu, Zhu Airen's mother, lived there. Village Chief Zhu felt that he did not need to live in such a building, and he was not used to living in one either. This house was prepared for his granddaughter to live in. He thought that his granddaughter had returned from abroad, and foreigners liked to live in one-story buildings, so he provided the house for his granddaughter to live in. (109)</p>
<h3>The Meat Market</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The words "advantage" and "disadvantage" are relative. From one point of view, something may be considered harmful, but from another point of view, it may be considered beneficial. Such situations are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>After the problems in the pork market, those who used to feast when passing the butcher's shop could no longer do so, and could not help but drool with regret. But normally, Shanghai consumed 5,000 to 6,000 pigs a day. After the war, this was reduced by half, and recently, it was only 20 to 30 a day. Therefore, from today onwards, the slaughterhouses in both concessions have stopped slaughtering pigs. From the pigs' point of view, they should be shedding tears of gratitude.</p>
<h3>The Sorrows of a Virgin</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Yes, My darling danghcgr</p>
<p>A Warner Bros. Production, Showing at the Cathay Grand Theatre</p>
<p>"The Sorrows of a Virgin" is a comedy worth watching, but the advertising friends have distorted it. This distortion, whether intentional for the sake of "business sense" or due to the subconscious revelations triggered by the translated title, will weaken the value of the film itself.</p>
<p>The director, William Keighley, is a familiar figure to us. Didn't his "Valley of the Giants" and "Robin Hood" give us good impressions? Not long ago, he borrowed his wife, Genevieve Tobin (who plays Connie in the film), to visit Shanghai, and the Shanghai office of Warner Bros. even held a tea party for him at the International Hotel.</p>
<p>However, most of his past works belonged to the so-called "hard" films. A light comedy like "The Sorrows of a Virgin" is rare. Talent knows no bounds! William's handling of this film is no less successful than his previous so-called "hard films": witty and humorous, lively but not boisterous.</p>
<p>The story of "The Sorrows of a Virgin" is very simple: A wealthy magazine editor, responding to the advice of a friend, goes to the countryside for a weekend trip to breathe some fresh air, but as a result, he does not get a quiet rest. His friend's daughter has a small misunderstanding with a young architecture student and poet (because the poet is too poor to attend her graduation ceremony). When the misunderstanding is cleared up, the young man, for the sake of his independence, has to leave her for two years until he succeeds. For this reason, she decides to return to the small villa in the countryside with him for a two-day gathering, but her actions are interfered with. Through her efforts and the help of her grandmother, she finally gets her wish. In the end, the family, because of their resolute and bright love, fulfills their good intentions.</p>
<p>The story is naturally American, too far away from our current bloody China. However, in our semi-feudal society, the next generation's struggle for their freedom of love - the autonomous search for the partner who will sustain their lifelong happiness - has its value in terms of anti-feudalism. "When you were my age, would you have wanted to be interfered with?" (something to that effect). Eileen's fingerprints silenced her novelist mother.</p>
<p>Children should have their own freedom - that is to say, children should not be the private property of their parents.</p>
<p>The director's technique is very superb. Such dialogue-heavy material is handled with such lightness and vitality, and the comedic atmosphere is very strong, which is not an easy task. The success of this is due to several factors: one is that the characters of each role are written as living people; another is the clear and concise editing; and even more so is the complete matching of the actors. In this play, it is simply difficult to distinguish who is the protagonist. And because of this, the play is successful.</p>
<p>If a play must have a protagonist, then, in my opinion, the protagonist of this play should be May Robson, who plays the old grandmother Granny, and not Priscilla Lane, who plays Eileen. Priscilla Lane naturally plays well, especially in the opening scene where she argues with Douglas, which shows that she can play a modern American woman, agile and healthy and not a lipstick-filled character. Compared with O'Sullivan and others, she is younger and more lovely. What about the other roles? I don't want to list them all. I just want to tell you one sentence is enough: it is difficult to say who is the protagonist and who is the supporting role in this play.</p>

<h3>(1) The Transformation of Material Life</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Materialists always insist on the omnipotence of matter, denying all forces outside of matter. But when he encounters great suffering, or when he feels that non-material forces can supplement it, he may realize the need for a super-material comfort. This super-material thing is the spirit of mankind.</p>
<p>Today, our country is facing a rare crisis. The survival, honor, and disgrace are all tied to the spirit of the Chinese people, and not entirely to the strength of the military. We must rise up together, correct the life of drunkenness and self-abandonment, and exert the greatest and most upright spiritual power to complete our mission of inheriting the past and opening up the future.</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, especially those of us living in Shanghai, have we ever reflected on our current life? Are we able to pay attention to material enjoyment and neglect the fulfillment of purity? Are we still indulging in the decadent life of wine, women, tobacco, and gambling, and forgetting the great responsibilities to the country and the nation? If so, we should immediately transform our lives and make them more serious, so as to avoid a decadent will and scattered spirit, which will affect the future of individuals and the country.</p>
<p>However, we firmly believe that to transform our lives, we still need help in morality and faith. Jesus Christ is our good friend, Taoist priest, and savior. He will guide us, cleanse our sins, and give us the power to transform our lives. He is the only savior of mankind. Those who believe in him will not perish, but have eternal life.</p>

<h3>Chaplin Receives Numerous Threatening Letters for Filming New Film "The Dictator"</h3>
<p>— (Shu Mang)</p>
<p>Special Guards Hired to Protect Him in Shifts, Determined Not to Waver from His Original Intention and Strive to Proceed</p>
<p>The new talkie "The Dictator" by silver screen comedy master Charlie Chaplin, as everyone knows, satirizes a certain dictator. It emphasizes the stupidity and ridiculousness of certain barbaric and unreasonable political phenomena in the current world situation and brings them to the screen in the form of comedy, giving them a merciless blow in front of audiences around the world. This will of course make certain people who are being satirized feel angry and threatened, and therefore they have resorted to their usual rogue means - intimidation - assassination against Chaplin.</p>
<p>"The Dictator" has already started filming and is currently in active production. However, since the decision to start filming this film, Chaplin has received countless threatening letters, mostly saying that "The Dictator" contains "disparaging" meaning, forcing him to immediately stop filming, otherwise they will use terrorist means to put Mr. Zhu "to death," etc. In order to prevent being poisoned, Chaplin has recently hired a personal armed guard to protect him around the clock. During the preparation of his three meals a day, special detectives are assigned to supervise the cooking to prevent villains from poisoning him. At the same time, during the filming of the film, the surrounding area of the studio is also guarded, and the situation is quite serious. However, it is said that although Chaplin has been threatened by the intimidation of thugs, his original intention has not wavered in the slightest; on the contrary, the production of "The Dictator" is currently being actively accelerated, day and night, in order to present "this ridiculous comedy to enlightened people all over the world in the shortest possible time." According to Hollywood filmmakers being so heavily guarded, as if they were important political figures, is still a pioneering achievement in film history.</p>
<p>An Unofficial History of the Theatre World</p>
<h3>New Theater Group to Rehearse "The True Story of Ah Q"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai theatre scene seems rather cold and lonely. Apart from occasional performances by school theatre groups, the Shanghai Theatre Arts Society is only performing early morning shows on Sundays at the New Guangda Theatre. Large-scale performances have not been seen on the spring theatre scene.</p>
<p>In reality, the Shanghai theatre scene is flowing with an exciting "low tide," and the "low tide" may be just around the corner and once again stir up a "high tide."</p>
<p>This "high tide" also confirms what I am about to report, that Xu Bufu and others, formerly of the Qingdao Theatre Society, have newly organized a New Theater Group. The members include Zhang Wan, Cai Jin, Shen Ling, and others.</p>
<p>Although this is a newly formed theatre group, and very little news has been revealed outside, in reality they are working hard behind closed doors, rehearsing Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" at their group's location on Route Foch these days. This, you can imagine, is such a great plan.</p>
<p>"Ah Q" has not been performed in Shanghai before. "China Travel" wanted to perform it before, but the result was destroyed by the artillery fire. Now the New Theater Group is performing "The True Story of Ah Q" as their first shot, and I have to admire their boldness.</p>
<p>The role of "Ah Q" is played by Shen Ling, who is a student at the Sino-French Drama School. Guess who is responsible for directing the whole play? It is the traveler who wrote tens of thousands of words on "The Low Tide of the Shanghai Theatre World" in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao. (Also known as Xiao ). I haven't seen this gentleman's plays before. We hope that he can overcome all difficulties and bring "Ah Q" to meet us soon.</p>
<h3>Skating Technique (12) Starting Steps</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen</p>
<p>Starting Steps</p>
<p>No matter what pattern you are skating, you must be stable and not jittery. You must stand still before starting. You should use a lot of force when starting, so that one foot can form an eight-character shape in one breath without interruption. When skating any pattern, of course, do not exhaust your strength. You must save enough strength to maintain your speed.</p>
<p>During competitions or exams, you must not borrow force from the main foot when starting. You must rely entirely on the push of the auxiliary foot. Use the entire edge of the shoe to push, not just the toe. After pushing, the auxiliary foot remains behind, with the toe pointing downward and outward, and the leg angled outward from the hip. If the auxiliary foot is not smooth and even when pushing, it will definitely be unsightly. A common mistake is that the knee is too close to the main knee, and the toes are drooping or too far outward.</p>
<p>Starting Acceleration Method</p>
<p>(1) Lean your body in the direction of movement. For example, if you are moving to the right, lean to the right. If you are moving to the left, lean to the left. And keep the center of gravity of your body and mind within the circle you want to draw. (This method is more effective when drawing a circle than when starting.)</p>
<p>(2) Before the main foot touches the ground, it should swing down like a sickle or hammer.</p>
<p>(3) Let any arm hang down and swing down like a clock pendulum. Avoid lifting the arm horizontally.</p>
<p>(4) The foot standing on the ground should straighten the knee and push off the ground with the foot at the same time.</p>
<p>The above four methods can be used at the same time or separately. If you use them at the same time, you can avoid fatigue.</p>
<p>Four-Sided Starting Method</p>
<p>Before starting, you must first place a straight line in the rink (called the vertical axis), fix your eyes on the position, and then start. The size of the country should be equal, and the beginning and end should be level. Do not start large and then small, or curved and skewed.</p>
<p>(1) Outward Progress Starting Method</p>
<p>Bring your heels close together. The left foot should form a 45-degree angle with the vertical axis. Lift your right foot and move it to the back, then move your right foot straight into the arc. The center of gravity should be within the circle you want to draw. Swing any arm forward, but do not move both arms forward at the same time. At the same time, lean your body forward and move your left foot forward. Bend your left knee first and then straighten it. When moving outward, keep your auxiliary leg and shoulder behind you for as long as possible. The longer you keep them behind, the better it looks. When moving forward, the auxiliary shoulder should be ahead of the auxiliary leg. The auxiliary leg must be straightened when moving forward, and the knee can be slightly lubricated after moving forward.</p>
<p>(2) Right Inward Progress Starting Method</p>
<p>All methods are the same as the right outward progress, but the left foot should form a 30-degree angle with the vertical axis. When moving inward, keep the auxiliary leg behind you for as long as possible, and extend it outside the circle you are drawing. Move your auxiliary shoulder forward early so that your action faces the direction of movement without leaning to the side.</p>
<p>It is easier to use the standing starting method for inward and outward progress. Stand upright, keep your feet close together, and the main foot and auxiliary foot should form a T shape. Bend your main knee when starting. Do not bend your waist. Keep your auxiliary foot on the ground for as long as possible. After moving, straighten your auxiliary toe outward, straighten your main knee, and do not move your auxiliary leg close to your main leg. (A common problem for beginners is that they clamp their thighs together and do not straighten their auxiliary leg from the hip, but bend it at the knee.)</p>
<p>(3) Outward Retreat Starting Method</p>
<p>Face the circle you want to draw, and keep your left foot parallel to the vertical axis. Lift your right foot and place it in front of your left foot, swinging to the left of your left foot. Your center of gravity is on your left foot. At the same time, (A) lean your body to the right, (B) move your right foot from left to right in front of your left foot, and (C) swing your right arm to the right. You can also use your left arm, but do not use both arms at the same time.</p>
<p>(4) Right Inward Retreat Starting Method</p>
<p>Face the vertical axis, with your back to the circle you want to draw. Keep your left foot parallel to the vertical axis, and your center of gravity on your left foot. Swing your right foot past in front of your left foot, and the rest is the same as the right outward retreat starting method.</p>
<p>Note - The toe of the supporting foot (i.e., the right toe) should be pointing inward, and the left foot must leave the ground immediately. The left leg should move from inside the circle to outside the circle. This is like the rudder of a ship, which can turn the whole body.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen News</h3>
<p>— Qin Tian</p>
<p>Yi Hua Manager Yan You will direct "A Trip to Mars," which will be a completely scientific film.</p>
<p>Yu Lin only has one dimple on the left side of her face. Unexpectedly, after Hu Die, there is another person like this. There will truly be a future after the future.</p>
<p>Li Pingqian's "The World of Gold and Silver" is adapted from the famous French writer Molière's "The Miser," which was once put on stage and became very popular.</p>
<p>Wang Yin's "Desperate Fugitive" has already started filming. The leading actors are Yuan Meiyun and himself. This is a completely hard film.</p>
<p>Wang Cilong is currently buried in writing a detective script.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang's direction of "Mulan Joins the Army" has produced unexpected results. The story of the film is introduced below:</p>
<p>Lawyer Wang Zhenzhong's wife, Lin Yuhua, demands that her former lover, Liang Ziqing, return the love letters she gave him in the past, but Ziqing refuses. At this moment, the woman who was deceived by Ziqing, Suqiu, suddenly bursts in. Yuhua hurriedly hides behind. In that instant, Ziqing is assassinated by Suqiu, and Suqiu commits suicide out of fear of being punished for her crime. Yuhua panics and escapes through the window.</p>
<p>The detective arrives after hearing the news. From Suqiu's intermittent confession, he learns that it is a love affair murder case, and these words happen to fall into the ears of Zhenzhong, who has come to look for his wife. He picks up a handkerchief with bottom on a sofa. He goes home and immediately forces her to leave the family.</p>
<p>Yuhua roams outside and sees an advertisement in the newspaper for lawyer Wang Zhenzhong seeking a good doctor, which makes her even more sad. She repeatedly returns home, but receives a stern reprimand. Disappointed, Yuhua returns to the hotel. The horror of life leads her into the arms of special figures Hu Da and A Long. She becomes a little sheep, working as a dancer, a prostitute, and gradually degenerating into the lowest prostitute. Hu Da and A Long's father think that she has lost her beauty and have another evil plan, and the target is precisely lawyer Wang Zhenzhong.</p>
<p>Zhenzhong's daughter, Jianying, returns to China after completing her studies overseas and inherits her father's profession. During the trial of Yuhua's murder case, the court appoints Jianying as her defense lawyer. Yuhua, while looking at Jianying, cannot help but reveal relief from her pain. When requesting Jianying to temporarily act as her daughter and call her mother a few times, Yuhua passes away with a smile.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Shanghai Stars in Hong Kong (II)</h3>
<p>— Sketch Artist: Zheng Zhihang　Writer: Zheng Youxuan</p>
<p>Li Li of Beiping</p>
<p>Ever since the labels of "suspect" and "female spy" were placed on Li Li of Beiping by Dao Wei-jia, she immediately became a "problematic figure." All newspapers, unintentionally, did a lot of free publicity for her. Although the name "Li Li of Beiping" was well-known in the north before, it was very unfamiliar in the south. But now it's different! When she was acquitted and flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong, the people of Hong Kong almost treated her like an important person, welcoming her and interviewing her! She also made speeches and received celebrities as if it were a big deal. Smart film producers saw this focal point and tried every possible means to win her over. As a result, they paid her four thousand yuan to make a Mandarin film called "An Extraordinary Beauty." But when this film premiered, she suddenly disappeared! The publicity tactics were quite clever.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Peking Opera World</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Da Liwu's Love of Practical Jokes</p>
<p>Da Liwu, Li Yuanting, was not only foul-mouthed, but also loved to play pranks, especially on others. Once, Yu Yuqin's grandfather was the victim of his tricks, which went badly for him. Yu's nickname was "Big Beast," and he and the famous clown Gan San both had a fondness for riding donkeys. Whenever he went to a restaurant to perform, he used the donkey as transportation. When he arrived backstage, he would always tie the donkey in the backstage courtyard. Unexpectedly, one day Da Liwu suddenly felt mischievous. While the donkey's owner was performing on stage, he sneaked into the courtyard, led the donkey to a secluded spot, and used paintbrushes and paint to personally paint the donkey's face. The facial makeup painted on the donkey's face was exactly the same as the facial makeup Yu Boss wore that day on stage. After he finished painting, he led the donkey to a crowded place. Everyone looked at it and burst into laughter. Instantly, the backstage area was filled with noise, and everyone shouted in unison, "This is the real Big Beast!" Yu Boss, nicknamed "Big Beast," was performing on stage at that moment. He suddenly heard laughter and commotion from backstage, and everyone was shouting his nickname. He had no idea what was going on and couldn't help but panic. He forgot his lines and didn't know where to put his hands and feet. So, inexplicably, he made several mistakes. He barely finished the performance (luckily, it was the last scene). He rushed backstage and saw the scene. He was both angry and amused. He wanted to grab Liwu and fight him, but he had already disappeared. Helpless, he endured the pain and removed his makeup and washed his face. After washing his own face, he had to wash the donkey's face. Unexpectedly, Liwu was even more mischievous. Before painting the donkey's face, he applied a lot of glue to the donkey's face. In addition, the donkey's face had hair, which was different from a human face, so the paint was difficult to wash off temporarily. Yu Boss frantically worked for a long time, using several buckets of cold and hot water, causing the donkey to scream loudly from the heat. In the end, he still couldn't wash it off. Seeing that it was getting dark and the people backstage were going home for dinner, he angrily rode the donkey with the painted face back home. Everyone who saw him on the way pointed and talked, thinking it was a strange thing. (End)</p>

<h3>Zuo Zongtang Requests an Inscription</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper, May of the eleventh year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Zuo Zongtang reported that the government troops attacked Suzhou and were fortunate to have the spiritual response of the Thunder God, thus achieving a great victory. He requested that an inscription be awarded, which was approved by the Emperor. The Hanlin scholars of the Southern Study were ordered to respectfully write the inscription and hand it over to Zuo Zongtang to receive and respectfully hang in the Thunder God Temple in Gansu Province.</p>
<h3>Providing Relief to Korean Refugees</h3>
<p>A British merchant ship was navigating in the sea 600 miles southeast of Chengshantou in Dong Province when it encountered seven Korean nationals who had fallen into the water after their boat capsized. They were rescued immediately by a sampan and taken to the Donghai Customs according to their names. After Supervisor Gong Yitu and others questioned them one by one, they were all unfamiliar with Chinese language and writing. One of them presented a small wooden plaque, one side engraved with the characters "Xianchang Gao Wenzong Dingchou Born," and the other side engraved with the characters "Lingyan Qiuzishi." Another presented an iron fishing hook. They all had their hair in a bun and wore large white silk clothes, undoubtedly from a Korean fishing boat that encountered a storm at sea. Supervisor Gong and others sent a letter to the British Consul to commend the merchant ship and reported the situation to the court, requesting the court to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Admonition against Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>Originally, there was no intention to smoke opium,</p>
<p>Friends spent all the money together;</p>
<p>Who knew it would really become addictive,</p>
<p>Turning rich and poor over to fate.</p>
<p>Once, I enjoyed prostitution, gambling, and drinking,</p>
<p>I couldn't stop getting used to smoking white smoke;</p>
<p>Later, I gave up prostitution and gambling,</p>
<p>But my face turned dark when I craved opium.</p>
<p>From then on, I smoked opium at home,</p>
<p>Sleeping until the sun was high in the sky;</p>
<p>Smoking made my face thin and gaunt,</p>
<p>Carrying things with just two shoulders.</p>
<p>The house was sold, the paper notice red,</p>
<p>The broker busy as usual;</p>
<p>Selling mutton was not as good as selling dog meat,</p>
<p>The front hall and back yard given to the opium den.</p>
<p>The rent was in arrears, the bills unpaid,</p>
<p>It was hard to borrow opium from the foreign firm;</p>
<p>My prostitute wife was abducted and went with someone else,</p>
<p>Leaving only a rusty knife in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I advise you not to smoke opium again,</p>
<p>Quickly quit and get through these years;</p>
<p>I have been through this bitter sea,</p>
<p>These are not harsh words at all.</p>
