<h3>英法美三國對天津事件　相互非正式交換意見　英法對美國所持態度甚爲重視　赫爾延見法蘇兩大使會商津局　美輿論主以堅強舉動贊助英法</h3>
<p>（巴黎）關於遠東局勢曁英法蘇三國談判、外交部長龐萊於今日午後接見英國大使費潑斯爵士、加以討論、事後並用長途電話與法國駐英大使考賓、有所接洽、據聞英法美三國對於天津事件、現正非正式交換意見、但此間負責人士對於美國態度、甚爲重視、目爲未來發展之決定的因素云、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據消息靈通方面宣稱、國務卿赫爾及共左右、昨晚以憂慮態度審查遠東問題、國務院方面拒絕對該問題加以評論、但咸懼目前遠東方面之僵局將於週末打開、而發生爆炸式的行動、結果必使美方直接被捲入漩渦、此間認爲天津事件之和平解決希望、甚爲微薄、聞赫爾本星期將與法大使晤談、在近數日中、赫氏已與英大使會晤數次、同時並曾與由日返國之美國駐日大使格羅商討遠東問題、非官塲方面預料、在英法決議內容未明瞭前、美方暫不採取任何動作、聞美國擬任令英法首先發動、然後再有所動作、蓋一九三一年時、美國首先發動後、歐洲各民主國竟未予以後援也、（十八日美聯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於中國天津市局勢、國務院左右人土均謂、此事牽涉美國、與牽涉英法兩國初無二致以故美國對於各該國完全寄以同情云、大抵國務院方面諗知兩國倘無美國贊助、對於日本未必能認眞有所作爲、但美國政府仍擬等待英國內閣態度更較解明之後、始乃決定方針、此其原因不外兩端、　與英法兩國政府交換意見、藉知其眞意所在、　不欲協遽有所表示、以致妨碍中立法修正案之討論、此在一般人、則謂日本此决之事、本諾遠大的計劃、其最後目標乃將西方人士接諸亞洲之外、半官界評論時事者、雖謂德義兩國在天津事件中、與日本未必有何正式協商、但日本所稍方式所引論據、則與德義兩國一脈相承、且各該國報紙亦均贊同日本之舉動、則三國沆瀣一氣、殆無可疑、羅斯福總統與美國政府各發言人、均曾諄諄以德義日三國搆成三重威脅爲言、茲已信而有徵、目下與論方面、傳統反日情緒、又復顯然可見、均主美國應以堅强舉動、費助英法兩國、多數報紙社論、均謂美國茲與日本賡續通商、殊屬不當、並要求抵制日貨、卽在孤立主義派每日新聞報、亦復主張英美兩國海軍聯合封鎖日本海岸、衆論僉同、可於此見之、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）赫爾國務卿頃於本日分別延見法國大使聖岡旦、蘇聯大使烏曼斯基、會商中國天津市局勢、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於中國天津市局勢、政府當局因對日有寶施經濟制裁之可能、正與美國曁各自治領、尤其是澳洲與紐西蘭、保持密切接觸、就中美國態度如何、甚爲此間所重視、並目爲天津事件未來發展中之決定的因素、同時政府當局仍繼續努力、希望天津事件、得循外交途徑解決之、職是之故、此間官塲對於華盛頓傳來消息、謂白宮方面或將出而調處英日爭議、頗感欣慰、惟仍相信日方若果正式要求控制各國在華租界、則美國必將與英法共同行動、對日實施經濟制裁、殆無疑義、屆時美國旣爲日本之主要債權國、又爲日本最大顧客、其在對日報復措置中、必有極大貢獻也、此外、制裁辦法若果實施、則不列顛帝國全體、務須一致參加、乃克有濟、例如澳洲聯邦對日貿易、佔其對外貿易總額百分之六十、實施經濟封鎖之後、自當與日本斷絕商務關係、南菲聯邦亦當以其羊毛、停止輸入日本、查南菲聯邦與澳洲聯邦所產羊毛、在品質上遠較南美洲各國所產爲佳、一旦停止售予日本、該國自必感受重大影響云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英閣員今夜皆等侯天津時局之發展、首相張伯倫雖在鄕間度其週杪、然時與相邸接觸、外相哈立法克斯今日自的克夏返倫敦、對於最近之發展予以密切注意、（十七日路透社雷）</p>
<p>（倫敦）哈里法克斯外相、頃於午後自的克郡返抵此間、雖在週末假期、仍駐京辦公、外交局勢之嚴重、於此可見、蓋以英法蘇三國正在莫斯科進行談判、而天津事件亦無緩和之勢故也、關於天津事件、英國當局是吾派遺軍艦運載糧食前往天津英租界、尚未有所決定、仍待駐華艦隊司令諾白爾中將有所發動、此外、內閣外交委員會定於星期一晨開會、就一般局勢、加以檢討、張伯倫首相雖在迄葛斯鎭消度週末假期、惟仍與唐寗街首相官邸、保持密切接獨云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英政府考慮　繼續貸華三百萬鎊</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據外交界昨晚消息、爲報復日軍封鎖天津英法兩租界起見、英國政府除施用其他嚴格經濟制裁辦法外、並擬予中國以更大之財政援助、當英法兩國對犬津危機、仍在談商之際、英國政府已考慮一計劃、繼續貸華以三百萬鎊、藉作向英勝買軍火、及其他軍需品之用、該項貸款早已決定支付、惟因華方未具担保品而遲遲不果、英國政府對此條件、目前已不再堅持、緣英國政府正設法以最有效方案報復日方之封鎖也、英國政界希望上海日軍當局、設法阻止昨日英軍與「大道」警察間嚴重事件之擴大、蓋上海危機最易牽涉美國、使美國與英國採取一致對日之報復行動也、（十八日美聯社）</p>
<p>（倫敦）曼哲斯特導報稱、衆信日方封鎖天津英租界目的之一、在强迫英法制止以軍火經緬甸安南等地運入中國、供給華軍對日作戰、故各方咸認爲應付日本恫嚇之最良辦法、即爲加强對華之援助云、（十八日電）</p>
<h3>日宣稱反對英邀第三國干涉</h3>
<p>（東京）據日方通信社之消息、日本官塲之宣佈、如英國採取立即與積極之步驟、以保議其在華權益、則日本勢必採行必要方法、以應付新局勢、依日政府方面之意見、英國當局所發之言論、旨在粉飾英當局因頑固拒絕交出早應引渡的刺程案兇犯而鑄成之大錯而已、英國邀請第三國干涉此種問題之企圖、日本決不能接受之、蓋英國在最後時期、提出此　方案、完全與實在環境不相適應、日本在目前事件中、所欲有者、爲英國在華政策、如不引渡刺程案兇犯一事所表示者之澈底改善耳、日本此項政策、與對在華有關各國之政策、毫無關係、並不若英國所言也云、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本政界人士頃宣稱、關於天津事件之具體解決方案、當繼續由日本地方常局處理、天津爭端純係英日兩國之衝突、所以英國企圖牽涉第三國在內之舉、日本認爲不甚得體云、（十八日海通社電）</p>
<p>（東京）昨日日本半官方面所發表之意見、頗可視爲對英國將以經濟制裁施諸日本之答覆、此間半官方面對英方「日本之要求影響條約國家在中國之利益」一語、加以詆毀、並表示「倘英國眞採取積極性質之步驛、以保護其所謂條的國權利、則日本將被迫採取適應新局勢之必要措施、」（十八日海通電）</p>
<h3>泰晤士報主張行動務須迅速</h3>
<p>（倫敦）中國天津市局勢頃由星期泰晤士報與「觀察家」週刋加以評論、劍謂談判門戶仍未閉塞、但若日本對於各國在華租界正　表示覬覦之念、則英國必以最強硬之行動答之、星期泰晤士報外交問題記者之言有日、現行局勢未便以性質濡緩之經濟手段、圖謀解決、換言之、政府務須迅速行動、以目前而論、談判途徑、仍未杜塞、天津事件僅爲英日兩國當局之事、英國所擬採取之措置、尚無邀請美國合作之議、「但若日本所提要求固持不讓、造成僵局、並威脅各國在華利益、則最嚴重之局勢、即將因之而起、屆時美法兩國旣因與吾國利害相同、美國自必有所舉動、以保衛其利益、可斷言也、茲者、日方要求英國與之合作、以樹立其所謂「東亞新秩序」、英國決無應允之可能、日方其他種種耍求、欲在實際上控制英國在華各處租界、亦非英國所能接受、「觀察家」週刊外交問題記者之言有曰、關於津市四華人引渡問題、英國會經建議組織聯席委員會、加以解決、此議迄未撤回、故現行爭端、仍可作爲地方事件、予以解決、但若日本政府確實決定提出更較遠大之問題、牽涉各國在華地位、則英國政府即當以全力保衛其地位、曩日如此、今亦猶然、屆時美法兩國是吾出以並行舉動、非所聞也」云（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法報抨擊德義唆日對英挑釁</h3>
<p>（巴黎）强硬報今日稱、據義國報載消息、今之天津事件、係實行全能國所已擬定的偉大計畫、志在摧毀民治國者之一部、惟英法美三國都城所接之消息則不如是、據外交界意見、日本已決定限制其行動之範團云、巴黎時報對於遠東事件不作樂觀、其社論謂、現有一種觀念、以爲德義兩國覺將來終須在兩陣作戰、現乃羅致日本加入在事實上等於三國聯盟之一種辦法、而唆使日本藉保衛純粹的日方利益之假面具、向英國挑釁、庶使民治國分其力　云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯報紙對於天津局勢、今日始破其沉默態度、而發表議論、謂天津與其他新近事件、涉及在華英人者、僅爲日本用以造成衝突之藉端、目前遠東時局緊張之眞正原因、爲日本欲將英美逐出中國、並奪取天津上海等處公共租界之希圖云、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>天津與但澤</h3>
<p>今日之天津問題，無論在顯微鏡檢視之下，彼所顯露之本質；無論在望遠鏡瞭望之中，彼所映射於世人心頭眼底之觀感，以與嘗爲國際風雲焦點而迄未穩定之但澤問題，度長絜大，則天津問題之意義更深長而關係彌重大，毫無疑義者也。但澤，自由市也；其法理地位，隸於波蘭，而其政治潛力，宗於德意志；其爲問題：德索之，波不予；問題之出入，在於甲乙得失之間；問題之影響，在於波羅的海今後之爭覇；問題之主角惟德與波，而歐洲各國左右袒之。天津問題由於日本之封鎖天津英租界，殃及法租界；將由是而決定者（一）英法對於華北日軍及偽政權在事實上予以承認與吾、（二）英法保持天津租界與吾，（三）歐美各國在華之其他租界，保持與吾，（四）歐美各國在華權益，保持與否，（五）歐美各國退出遠東與吾，（六）各國援華政策放棄與吾，即對於侵略行爲承認與吾，（七）九國公的繼續有效與吾，（八）有關遠東之各種條的，得由片面更張與吾。歸納而簡言之，歐美各國與中國，近一百年來所造就之關係，是吾將讓由日本獨霸而告一結束？至於四嫌疑犯之引渡問題與大不列顛之威望問題，問題之渺小不足道者也。但澤問題，、在政治上宣傳上外交上，由德國取攻勢而波蘭取守勢，目前在行動上殆無發展。天津問題，猶對弈，日本旣下「先着」，英國已落「後手」，以外交爲不重要之「刼」以經濟行動爲決定全盤勝負之「點眼」。日本爲天津問題僅得德國之搖旗吶喊，而不獲有效之援助；亦猶德國爲但澤問題，僅得日本之空言同情，決不以反共關係而慷慨同盟。關於但澤之爭持，德國友邦義大利，陽稱助德，陰實勸德以萬勿孟浪；然一朝破裂，義必全力助德。關於天津之糾紛，日本友邦義大利，獎飾日本之勇敢，而羅馬論壇旣情不自禁於問鼎分肥之表示；然一朝破裂，無論經濟方面，甚或軍事方面，德義俱未能助日本以絲毫。波蘭爲反侵略而締盟英法，示好蘇聯，其得保持但澤，實托庇於此大局之下；一朝有事，至少爲全歐之戰，行且爲全世界之戰；惟其然，故各不孟浪，即不致於戰；即使不免於戰，即使以但澤爲導火統而竟戰，但決非爲但澤而戰。英國於天津事，未嘗在國際條的上取得同盟，然取瑟而歌之表示，攘袂而起之姿態，固已見諸大西洋之兩岸；何也，共通之利害所在，視條的義務爲允有力焉。</p>
<p>雖然，天津問題之歸宿，未可斷言也；日前評述其事，嘗謂英國有三魔，遠有美國之孤立派，近有蘇聯之矜持，內以自尊而自蔽；此三者，使英國喪其奮發之銳氣，解決津事遂無必遵之方式。近數日，大體依然若此；所可備爲論斷之新資料者：美國雖無切實之正式表示，然昨日國務卿赫爾氏，爲津事而延見法蘇兩國駐美大使，此得視爲微妙之先聲，其一也。美國之孤立派，對歐事爲較注意，於遠東日本，蔑如也；而夙偏孤立之「每日新聞」，昨日評論固亦主張英美海軍封鎖日本海岸矣；其二也。西方輿情，僉尊視美國態度爲決定津事之因素，此所以自道義上責成美國者，自有其價值；顧昨晚華盛頓消息，似美國考慮者，並非動作與吾之問題，乃爲希望英法先行發動而美繼之，抑爲三國平行動作之問題；其三也。然則關鍵端在美國乎？若是而美國恝然遠東，置身事外，則奈之何？是誠大有出入而至堪注意；顧昨又發見英國方面希有之論調焉，蓋近年英國朝野之於外交，極徘徊瞻顧之致，遑論久已不見獨往獨來之行動，亦且久已不聞獨往獨來之主張；獨於津事，彼「觀察家週刊」之外交專門記者日：若日本確有遠大要求，則英國政府必竭全力保衛地位，屆時美法兩國是吾並行舉動，在所不問云；此則英國漸有恢復其獨往獨來之精神之徵也，其四也。此四者，不足以斷言津事究將如何歸宿；然不失爲觀察動嚮之重要資料。動嚮所示。似美國薄於波蘭之但澤問題，而厚於英國之天津租界問題，是猶不僅以利害之遠大，休戚之共通；亦以美國而顧問歐事。如履濘泥，如陷漩渦，雖耗大力，難期速效；若挺身而出以穩定遠東，此在美國乃如一舉手，一投足之勞；往者，內而與論未成熟，外而英國無決心，遂至蹉跎；及至今茲，非復昔比矣。</p>
<h3>津日租界內　反英運動愈劇烈　封鎖區中食物奇缺　交通檢查嚴厲如故　居民生活大感痛苦</h3>
<p>（天津）今日巳爲日方封鎖英法租界之第五日、反英宣傳運動愈見强烈、除日方報紙刋佈反英文字外、更散發傳單、及從事無錢電廣播、各搜查地點、均已裝置播音機、租界內之食物形勢、巳引起一般居民嚴重之關切、各菜塲之攤基、均已無物出售、英工部局總董悌伯、今日語路透社記者云、食米及麵粉之接濟、雖極爲充足、惟因日方派船巡視海河、致蔬菜肉類及魚鮮之供給、實際上已被截斷、昨日下午庚子死難日兵墳墓前所舉行之紀念儀式、頗爲簡單、日方有軍隊及領署代表與童子軍、共的三十人、前來參加、彼等所乘之汽車、開入法租界後、由法方派警察護送至英租界邊境、再由英工部局警官二人、乘摩托自行車護送至墳墓所在地點、英輸「馬勒夫人」號昨日抵津時、日方搜查人員、在大連郵船會社碼頭登輪檢查、惟並不嚴厲、查詢該輪之名稱及旗幟與船主之國籍後、卽放其駛往英租界外灘、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美商所辦報紙　日方禁止郵寄</h3>

<h3>日本軍事實力的拮据</h3>
<p>— 鑅</p>
<p>德Max　werner作</p>
<p>譯自“The　Milltary</p>
<p>Strengh</p>
<p>of　the　Powers「列强的軍事實力」</p>
<p>日本是屬於「經濟脆弱的軍事國家」一類的。日本並不是像他們自誇的「東方的普魯士」却是東方的意大利。她旣無原料，而其工業又相當的薄弱。因爲現代戰爭技術上的需耍，一個國家的軍事實力，是以經濟因素爲其最後決定的，一個經濟上脆弱的國家，決不能成爲一個第一等軍事强國的</p>
<p>日本的經濟制度在供應上無疑是十分不够的。重要原料方面如鐵，錳，其他金屬，油，橡皮，棉花，羊毛等，它不是完全沒有，就是有也很少而已。日本在銅的需要上有一半以上是自己生產的，亞鉛與鐵料的需要上，則能生產其半數，鋁，錫，鉛，以及油的需要上，那只有很少的數目了。它的鋼鐵工業，決不能供給它的戰時全部的需要。在戰事期內，它的鐵的需要一定要能得到百份之廿的進口才行。它的重工業基礎的薄弱，是不能使其發展爲强有力的戰時工業的。它在一九三六年的鋼的生產量上是四.五百萬噸，即等於德國或蘇聯鋼產量的四份之一與五份之一間的數目。一本日本軍部所發的小冊上說：「在這戰爭的前夜，應該極力注意到建起一個戰時工業的不可能。我們目前的生產能力，甚至不能滿足我們一般的需要。」</p>
<p>另外一張日文報論述：「日本的工業是一種畸形的發展製造輕工業是進步着，但重工業却依然在一種可憐的狀態下。從軍事的眼光看，那實在可說是一種比較危險的情形。」（見已黎Eilions　du　Correfeur）一九三六年出版的「備戰中的日本」）Japan　isPreparing　war)一書中第二百八十五面至六面）</p>
<p>日本戰鬥實力上最重要的癥結，在於它在機械工業方面和正式戰時工業的薄弱。機械工業方面的那種幼稚的發展，就表現了企圖戰時工業大發展的一種不能克服的基本困難。</p>
<p>與列强在這方面比較，日本。工業是比任何一國來得薄弱，且手藝不精的。它是列强中惟一的國家，甚至在平時都要向國外購買相當數量的軍需的。日本的戰時工業和機械工業，甚至比意大利都差得多。雖然日本的重工業是比較意大利略勝一籌。日本的機械工業和戰時工業上，是可以和波蘭一比的，但波蘭的飛機工業在質的方面講，却强過了日本。</p>
<p>以一九三四年至三六年生產數字作根據，在第一流的戰事的發生後開始十八個月內，—就說和蘇聯作戰的話—日本就要向國外購買相當數目的陣地戰中的大砲和高射砲。</p>
<p>日本在現代戰爭所用的反攻武器方面的生產量，是非常缺乏的。爲機械部隊所需耍的工業基礎，也同樣是很薄弱的。日木的汽車製造業非常落後，每年只出產幾千輛汽車。一九三六年東谷田（Toyada)汽車廠所宜佈的生產計劃，是四千輛的汽車和卡車，坦克車工廠的生產力，一年不能在三千輛以上的，這就是說，在戰事中，日本決不能一下同時給一千輛坦克車上戰塲了。超過了這個數目的坦克車，它就不得不向國外購買。飛機方面的情形也是如此。日本一年內至多不能生產五千至六千之間的機，這就是說，它在同一個時間內，不能一下有一千架以上的飛機，是可以應用的。在戰爭期間，飛機的產量，每年必需照已在應用的數目，再增平均四倍至六倍之間的數目才行。到這方面，因此日本又不得不依靠進口貨來供應了。</p>
<p>在現代戰爭的進攻武器方面，日軍的眞正實力，決不能在計算之內的，至於如蘇聯和德國戰略上所計劃的那種大量應用，那是更加談不上了加上在作戰時，日本的經濟制度將受到兩方面的威脅：方面是受海軍方面的封鎖，因爲蘇聯在太平洋的潛水艇的力量，是非常强大，（大家相信要比日本强得多）；另一方面是遭遇空襲，因爲現在已經很明顯的看出，在戰爭開始後，紅軍在空中立刻可以展開很强的威力。這兩方面，都是實在非常可能的，而且很容易證明脆弱的日本經濟制度的命運。</p>
<p>當德國官方和半官方面，還不需要顧忌未來的同盟的時候，他們是亳不躊躇的表示，他們對於日本的懷疑在二决第一流的戰事中，日本到底有多少機會，允共是很正確的看到了日本經濟制度脆弱的一面。在一九三四年，當蘇聯努力於軍事上的進步特殊之處，還沒有完全給人注意到的時候，德國的“Mililar.Wochenblatt”上這樣宣佈道：「在戰時，日本的政治軍事的機會，決不能像他們應有的，那樣有利於日本。日蘇戰爭起來的時候，結果也許就是日本經濟制度崩潰，同樣的也就是日軍的崩潰，因爲目前的日本，在經濟的戰時供應上，是無諭如何絕無希望達到它自給自己的地位的。（一九三四年十月二十五日的“Militar.Wochenblatt”。在一九三七年十月十日，那時中日戰事已在進行中了，Erankforterzeitung　上又這樣說：「除了Prine　Konoe（近衛）自已和他的經濟訊問之外，沒有人指出過，日本軍事經濟基礎的脆弱，結果不但是因爲原料上的困難，同時也是因爲日本工業工具的生產力的不足的緣故。中日間的「衝突」每天提供了新的證明，日本經濟機構上，特別在重工業和正式軍需工業上，所表現出來的，是與日本世界政治地位，以及它的狂大的企圖，是很不相稱的。」</p>
<p>在一種第一流的戰爭時，日本在它的工業方面，除了多少得一些有着相當準備的來福槍，和機開槍之外，別的東西是毫無希望的。像大砲，坦克車，飛機等的出產，即使照日本陸軍自巳定的那種尋常的標準來估計，也是十年，當蘇聯努力於軍事上的進步特殊之處，還沒有完全給人注意到的時候，德國的“Militar.Wocbenblatt”上這樣宜佈道「在戰時，日本的政治軍事的機會，決不能像他們應有的，那樣有利於日本。日蘇戰爭起來的時候，結果也許就是日本經濟制度崩潰，同樣的也就是日軍的崩潰，因爲目前的日本，在經濟的戰時供應上，是無論如何絕無希望達到它自給自足的地位的。（一九三四年十月二十五日的“Militar．Wochenblatt”在一九三七年十月十日，那時中日戰事已在進行中了，；Frankfurter　Zeitung”上又這樣說：「除了Puice　Bonoe近衛自巳和他的經濟顧間之外，沒有人指出過，日本軍事經濟基礎的脆弱，結果不但是因爲原料上的困難，同時也是因爲日本工業工具的生產力的不足的緣故。中日間的「衝突」每天提供了新的瞪明，日本經濟機構上，特別在重工業和正式軍需工業上，所表現出來的,是與日本世界政治地位，以及它的在大的企圖，是很不相稱的」。日軍所要經騐的困難，不僅是它的經濟制度脆弱的結果。日本爲戰事需用的人力，是比較一般的需要是少得多多了。日本受訓的後備兵的數目是比較的小，大的在二百萬至二百五十萬之間。日本的正規軍的數目大的是三十二萬强，這就是說，比波蘭半時的軍隊，稍爲强大些。</p>
<p>雖說日本的人口，是三倍於波蘭。根據一位蘇聯軍事專家的估計，只有五份之一的人數，靠得住充兵役的，是給召集起來而訓練了。這理由是一九二三至二五年所實行的軍隊改革案的結果，致在數量上改少相當大的一個數目。那目的是在改低了數量，而求技術力量上的增進，其决就是要擴充軍備，使近代戰鬥武器標準的提高，以冀補助陸軍技術落後的缺陷。但實際的情形，日軍並不能達到歐洲軍備的標準，而其實力反給大大的改　了。雖然日本是人口繁殖了，但它和法國比較起來，它的受訓的後備軍數目，僅及法國的半數。爲要適合戰時的需要，它耍動員大軍，日本就要將可能動員的受訓的後備軍，全部出盡才行。照外國的專家們（德國的和美國的）的估計，日本需要發動一百萬至一百二十萬人員上前綫－在蒙古邊境和海岸錢一帶去攻蘇聯。同時在國內，又要留下相當數目的部隊，更要另一部份隊伍去佔據華北和滿洲，因此戰事一發動，日本幾乎需要用到它的全部受訓的後備軍，這是很明顯的事實。因此和蘇聯作戰，一開始就使日本感到人力上一個極大的侷促威脅哩。</p>

<p>一個去勢或堵塞了輸精管的兒童，長成時會沒有鬍鬚，即有也是很少的，聲音很尖，還有幾種與平常男子不同的性格。所以生殖腺內分泌，不特主持我們的生殖作用，在幼年時更操縱了我們的發育機能。至於婚後的男女，那更支配了他們日常生活的健康和幸福。一對男健女美的伉儷，因爲愛情的濃厚，夫婦生活必然美滿。在夫婦生活美滿之後，體內的生殖腺的分泌液果然有一部分藉外導管而輸出，以相互調濟他們的身心。同時有一部分泌腺，直接流入血管，灌漑於全身，於是心神上得到安慰，身體上得到舒適，酣眠的羽翼就會降臨到他們一對美麗的人們。此外新陳代謝及其他各種機能均增進其作用，因此消化佳良，血行暢達，只要能够有相當的節制和衛生條件的做到，他們的健康，必然日益增進，愛情也格外久長，生男育女，組織美滿家庭，生活是何等幸福！所以說：夫婦生活美滿是增進健康和幸福的發動機，這完全是事實。但夫婦生活的美滿，必須以健康爲基礎。要是男子於早年犯有自凟與遺精，或早婚縱慾，把生殖腺分泌液消耗得太多了。那凡早洩陽萎，滑精漏精，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症即不一而足。此種丈夫雖有如花美眷在夫婦生活上必心有餘而力不足，這不特自己沒趣，衷心痛苦，熱情的妻子亦怎能甘休呢？因此牀第勃谿，憂傷成疾，或竟離婚私奔演出種種悲劇！這不特斷送了幸福，更傷害了健康。欲謀補救，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。誠以此劑於服後一日夜間卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經。調整新陳代謝作用，助長發育機能。上述各症於服用一星期後，輕者痊愈，重者减輕，若繼續服用一月以後必可各症霍然而身體益臻健康。德國名醫Tameillsam湯米爾生傳士會將此劑與他種類似製劑作比較試騐，結果，斷定「生殖素」之品質佳良，效力偉大，均高出其他類似製劑五倍至十五倍以上。幷富積極建設性的滋補力，老年中年人常服可收返老返童之功。至於其他類似製劑則每有刺激神經及胃腸之副作用，多服斷不相宜。若有遺精，則兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（五洲中西等大藥房有售）以制遺洩，收效尤速。</p>
<h3>遺精可使青年早衰</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>老，是人生必經的階段。由年齡的增加而致老，這是當然的；但也有因保養的週到，年齡雖增，幷不表現老態，這種人眞是幸福之至，若年齡尙輕而已現老態，或竟天年縮短，據衛生家的意見，這實是他自己的罪惡！本來天賦他六十歲而老，八十歲而死，現在他弄得三十歲就老，不至天年而死，豈不罪惡之至！</p>
<p>人們的所以衰老？以生殖腺虧損的原因爲多，並且衰老的速率也最快。不知自愛的靑年若在春情發動期犯有自凟，更因自凟或早婚縱慾等原因而繼起了遺精。有了遺精若再因循失治，致體內的生殖腺液消耗過多，則凡腦衰健忘，失眠多夢，腰酸背痛，腎虧早洩，發育不全，神經衰弱等症，即勢所難免。於是面黃瘦肌瘦，形神枯耗，年齡雖輕，已老態畢呈，甚至嗚呼哀哉，做短命之鬼！</p>
<p>德國某醫學家說：遺精實是我們生命源泉的漏巵，必須驚心動魄，速求早治，幷根據世名醫千萬病案及余經騐，在治療上均以服「希米脫氏固精片」，最爲特效，因此藥於服後功能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，使夜得酣眠，夢幻减少，遺精可於當夜立止，若因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，精血及神經，於繼續服用半月之後，必可恢復美滿健康，而益壽延年，患者若能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>乳峯在健美與幸福上的重要</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>無論什麼事情，假如不從根本上着想，那是終究要失敗的，現在姑以婦女愛美的一事來說吧，有許多女性，她們不從自身的健康上着思，而一味講究裝飾，這有什麼用呢？譬如一個很年輕的姑娘，因爲她多病多痛，失云了健康，而將女性最可貴的特徵美喪失——乳峯萎　，臀部瘦削，肌肉枯槁，則雖穿上極時髦的衣服，亦有何肉感動人的曲線？不僅如此，且因衣服過於輕薄的緣故。全身輪廓，更顯得醜陋可鄙！所以出入交際塲中，每被時代男子嗤之以鼻，或報以冷酷的議笑，即退一步在夫婦之間的私生活上。當此暑氣蒸人的夏夜，在無遮大會開始演出時。此種峯巒平伏的奇形怪狀，一觸入男子的眼　。無疑的耍把百二十分熱情，從沸點降至冰點，結果不歡而罷，厭惡在心，遂造成日後的種種惡果。這不是很習見的事嗎？</p>
<p>基上所述，可知乳峯在女性的健美和幸福上所關至大。如不幸萎　，應速求彌補，而彌補最可靠的方法，據中西婦科名醫實騐的結果。均公認以服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最爲對症而特效。蓋此劑的成分，係由極壯健的動物內提取其卵巢精華，經科學方法配製而成，故藥性和平。功效偉大。倘繼續服用，不特可使萎　的乳峯，日形高聳，瘦削的臀部，漸見丯腴，且能調整月經，消滅一切子宮障碍，旺盛新陳代謝作用，使面頰益顯嬌艷，增進夫婦間愛情，長駐靑春。</p>

<p>診時：上午九時至六時止</p>
<p>義務送診僅收號金四角</p>
<h3>淋濁發赤腫痛之特治法</h3>
<p>淋病在急性時，其龜頭及包皮，因淋毒的刺㦸而致發炎腫痛，爲急性時恒遇之症狀。患者之尿道口周圍部分，每必發赤腫痛，此種症象之輕重，恒與淋菌之强烈與否爲。其毒性强烈者，則尚有尿道口之下部，陰莖繫帶之兩側面，以致全部包皮，皆呈水腫而有光澤狀之腫脹，並伴有疼痛，但是此種腫脹瀦溜之漿液，與陰囊水腫相類，並非膿汁也。病狀既然已至如此地歩，其毒菌之侵襲已展至副尿道，林妥而氏腺及濾胞內，如其此等塲所果被毒侵襲，則每於此等塲所發生粟粒大乃至豌荳大之腫脹硬結，用觸診法即可觸知。因而尿道腔被此硬結障礙而狹小，排尿益感困難。</p>
<p>要偵察此等病情，當用新式尿道鏡作精細檢查，俾知病的真相。然後用德國濾淋平流電療法，直接向病灶透射蓋副尿道內之淋菌，絶對不能用局部手術可以扑滅，惟有濾淋電療，始可深入病灶。一方更用化學療法，及特製自家菌苗爲注射劑。如此在一星期內，則所有炎腫症象，完全消退，二星期，其尿道硬結，亦可消除，恢復原狀，此種療法，爲余十數年來之經騐結晶。</p>

<p>日當局在中國侵佔區中片面的實施目前之海關稅率，至本年六月一日，已歷一載矣，去歲五月卅一日，各國公認之一九三四年中國海關稅率，停止適用於日軍在華所控制之部份，次日，即在杭州灣以北各港與厦門實施現行之稅率，此日本製造之稅率，旋復擴展至廣州，本年，復實施於海南島，及江門暨華南虎門區之其他小港，雖日本擬定並實行此稅率，其他各外國對其實施，予以默從，然自無效力的國際公法之觀點粫言，此稅率仍為非法的，日本係假日軍在華成立之偽政權名　而出此，此種政權，並無正常政府所有之特徵，且未得任何國家之承認，甚至未得日本之承認，偽稅率僅為日方槍刺支持之獨行手段，外人之納此稅，非因予以承認，而因別無他途之故也，一九三八年之稅率，果如所料，使在華之日人大得其利，日本得日軍之援助，利用此稅率而得佔侵佔區內外國貿易之絕大部份，戰前，日本僅佔中國輸入貿易之什二左右，目前已在全中國佔什四以上，在日軍侵佔區內約佔半數，沿揚子江一帶之整批私運買賣未計入，在華北約佔什七，此係日期藏相石渡最近所言，一年前，日方宣稱其一九三八年之稅率，不過意在恢復一九三一年之中國舊稅率水準而已，但不得不承認一九三八年之稅率中，已實行許多不同於一九三一年稅率之例外條例，此等例外大多施諸日方特殊有利之輸出貨物，日方且斷言此稅率亦相等的計及一切外國之利益，今日海關之外國貿易統計册證明，大多數貨物之施用例外者，日本非獨佔其輸入，即在此等貨物之輸入中，佔絕大部份，再一九三八年之稅率，實予日方卵翼下北平偽政權以武器，偽政權全力使用之，與在華歐美商業利益相博門，日方憯奪中政府合法所有之稅率權，而藉此權力，在華北採取統制輸入之無數方法，結果於一九三三年三月十一日頒佈出口統制條件，立即由橫濱正金年新海關稅率而獲得之最大利益，乃為控制中國之海關，利用其收入以侵略中國，日本旣控制濱海諸省，中國對外貿易，大部份繼續在日軍侵佔區交易，乃自然之事，中國海關收入之大部份，由是產生，自去年六月一日至本年五月三十一日，中國海關收入之十之七八，產生於日方控制下各港，此一整年內之收入，均存入橫濱正金銀行，今被該銀行把持之中國海關稅收，共約二萬萬元，內半數產生於上海一地，日本仍堅稱未對華作戰，而把持中國最重要之收入來源，當然為最罕見之奇觀，日本不將此稅收交予其所稱中國合法政府之各偽政權，亦屬僅見之奇觀，但甚至有更可驚奇者，無權得此稅收之日本，竟悍然用武力憯佔之，對於第三國合法持有以關稅為抵之中國外債債劵者，不予償付，是項債券，為數頗鉅，達二千萬鎊以上，近者，不得不停付其本息，凡此皆為日本攫奪並使用中國關稅之直接結果也，用中國關稅償付以此作抵之中國外債，依法享有較其他要求為先之優先權，日前此等債款年須償付九千五百萬至一萬萬元，日方旣囊括中國海關收入總數之會什八左右，則應償付外債到期債款之什八，迄今為止，日方囊括之海關收入，已倍於債務，但橫濱正金銀行未撥分文，以償付中國以關稅為抵之外債，若該到期債款悉仰仗於日本，則自一年前之六月一日起，即已停付矣，中國政府為維持其自己之國際信用起見，雖僅收中國海關收入之什二，但對償還以前科為抵到期外債所需之款項仍十足撥付，凡九閱月，僅至本年二月，重慶始宣佈不能繼續嚴格履行中國之全部金融債務，已往三閱月中，中政府乃按照實獲海關收入之百分比，而償付到期債款，即至其時，日本仍不償付其什八之部份，故債款之一部份遂吿停付，若以中國海關為抵之債款僅仰給於日方，則是項債款，久已停付矣，且據報，日方在海關公署添　日籍僱員甚夥，尤以低級僱員為最，就另一方面而言，此等港口之海關被迫减少自己之薪給與開支，然後將餘款交橫濱正金銀行，亦有數地，海關收入不敷開支與薪給，致海關僱員欠薪甚久，厦门即屬共一，存於橫濱正金銀行之海關收入二萬萬元，其一部份屬諸中國海關債券之外國持有人，另一部份屬諸屬諸重慶中政府，但日方處理此等款項，猶如此款乃屬諸東京國庫者，日方佯稱，此款有特殊賬目，加以保管，而未動用，覽於日方其他保證之不可靠，故日方所言，乃起問題矣，日方對於此等款項，毫無任何精密賬目，以及橫濱正金銀行拒不出示其帳目，而任審閱中國海關收入究在何處與如何管理，此兩端明示日方對此款項有掩匿其實情之理由，事實上，日本決未留此海關款項，不加動用，而用各種方法，使用之，其目的與此款之合法性質與預定目的完全反對橫濱正金銀行中之大部份海關存款，似已一部份押出，一部份耗去，日方藉使用中國海關款項，供其一已之政治的，經濟的與軍事的目的，其途有三，（一）橫濱正金銀行，已以鉅額借款貸予北平與南京兩偽政府，以中國海關款項「作抵」，依屬諸外國持券了與中政府之款項，因此已間接移交日陸軍之不負責的政治伯傀儡，橫濱正金銀行素以過度之利率，而獲厚利，遂重演一九一八至一九年之著名西原借款買賣，惟此項受損失者，非日方而係華方之款項，（二）橫濱正金銀行以中國海關款項，在上海公開市塲當川買進外滙，藉此向海外購買軍需，供給在華日軍，且此種買進外匯，使上海工整市塲受其重壓，更因此而有助於日方暗傷法幣之政策，與套取中國滙兌準備金，（三）聞日方已囊括中國海關收入，而直接充其在華軍費，已有數種例證日方軍事與政治發言人對此當然矢口否認，而稱之為虛言，但彼等責當揭開橫濱正金銀行之簿册，供以中國關稅為抵，外債之外國持券人代表澈查，然日陸軍永不准許出此，戰是之故，一九三八年五月之英日海關協定，或已成為英國在遠東所鑄惡劣的外交上大錯之一，其他列强之加以同意者，無論其為表面上之同意或其他，均不能逃其咎，上世紀中葉，舉匪這亂時，外人首次充任中國海關收入之「保管人」，一九〇〇年後，當庚子賠款實行時，列强實際上控制中國之海關收入，而以英國居領導地位，而列强均未「濫用」中國之收入，按照舊時値百抽五稅率，償付債款之本息後，所餘收入，均交中政府自用，一九一七年中政府獲得關稅自主後，政府自行負責償付以關稅為抵，債款之本息，而忠實遵守此等債務，今中國非因已咎而迫不得已停付其以關稅為抵之外債，此在中國歷史上，猶屬初次，英國駐遠東各大使館經濟顧問巴志在東京商訂之協定，實闢在日軍侵佔區內實行目前之稅率，與日方「保管」中國海關款項之道路，是項協定，迄未履行，但日方已獲得協定中訂定給予彼等之一切利益，而棄絕其一切義務，英當局同意日方控制海關收入，其目產有二，（一）希望保持由英人所創立而外籍人員又多屬英人之海關公署，致不使分裂，（二）英當局希望保護外國持劵人之利益，大多數持券人或均屬英國，英國無疑的以為與日方有所措施，即能保證海關公署之整齊，其他列强之勸其國民繳付日方施行之稅率者，當亦具此意無疑，與巴志談判之日本文官，或亦具相類之意見，但已發生不可避免之事實矣，日方在其軍閥壓力之下，不特攫佔屬諸公認的中政府之收入，而改充自私自利之用途，抑且停付債之到期債款，而破壞條約與國際間之信義，暨當局顯未及時明瞭是項協定之談判，乃日方之勝利，監日方已能因此要求外國允諾一事，即攫佔中國之公共收入，以充私用是，庚子賠款之日本部份，計三十萬鎊，早料中國與日本作戰時，將拒絕賠付該款今存於滙豐銀行之擱置基金項下，一方，中國之拒不同意英日海關協定，亦在意料之中，因是兩端，吾人假定日方之所以同意訂立協定，而未如其軍事當局所恫嚇，悍然攫奪中國海關收入者，其志實在藉口中國之拒付賠款，而詭辯其不履行整個協定，事屬正當，於是其類於悍然攫佔並非法利用中國海關項，不啻獲外國一種許可，此種假定，似近乎邏輯也。</p>
<h3>中日貨幣戰之回顧與展望（續）</h3>
<p>— 安石</p>
<p>二，華北的貨幣戰與聯銀券的敗北</p>
<p>中日的貨幣戰，始於華北。日本經濟學家對於華北的貨幣戰，初極抱樂觀，依照他們的意思，華北是日本的勢力範圍，當時法幣發行總額約十四萬元，其中流通於華北者僅二萬餘萬元，此外雖還有地方銀行和民間銀行的鈔票，然為數無幾，不過六千萬元左右而已，法幣中中央和中國農民者很少，在部分是中國和交通二家的，所以對付較為容易。而且這些流通華北的法幣，其現金準備實際上保管於天津的發行準備管理委員會分會，而不直接握在國民政府手中，所以華北的法幣，大體上可視為以華北的經濟為基礎之地方貨幣。日本如果要在華北發行新通貨，祇須把法幣由華北逐出，而使華北的貨幣制度由法幣折離就够了，對於法幣並沒有斬草除根的必要。於是聯銀券使由他們之手產生出來了。可是無論他們用怎樣的壓迫手段，聯銀券的成績總和他們的預想相去很遠，尤其聯銀券曾一度跌到僅値法幣的七折，而中日貨幣戰在華北一開戰日本便敗北了。</p>
<p>這在他們也許是意外事，可是我們看來却是意中事，因為他們對於華北的幣制，正和他們戰前對於整個中國的經濟力量一樣，佔價過低了。</p>
<p>第一，他們以為華北的法幣流通額不多，故對付容易。殊不知法幣流通額之多少，是由於需要而定的，華北法幣流通額之少，完全由於華北的經濟狀况和需要，而非因於法幣在華北沒有鞏固的基礎和勢力，觀諸地方民間銀行雜色鈔票流通額之少便可知道。</p>
<p>其次，數額不多，正表示發行者之愼重從事，而反足以增加人民對於法幣之信仰。假使當時法幣在華北濫發而流通額甚鉅，則日本要推翻牠，也許容易得很。</p>
<p>第三，法幣，無論日人如何宣稱，究竟是買得到外匯的，而偽鈔和其相關聯着的日鈔則否。所以欲以惡貨來驅逐良貨，簡直是痴夢。</p>
<p>至於以華北視為特殊區域而將其與中央政府分離，這是他們日本學者的拿手好戲，我們實無辯駁的必要。此外，他們且鑄下一大錯誤，就是沒有（其實是無法）顧慮到本國之惡性通貨膨脹而將偽鈔和日圓相連。未幾因偽鈔之失敗而使日鈔也蒙受很大的不利。總之，日本在華北的貨幣戰，始終是敗北的，到了現在，華北法幣的黑市總遠在偽鈔之上。</p>
<p>三，初期華中的貨幣戰和日本的節節敗退</p>
<p>在中日貨幣戰，日本旣不得志於華北而反受了當頭一棒，所以對於華中，就不得不格外愼重從事。</p>
<p>在他們眼中，華中是國民政府之根據地，其經濟基礎至為鞏固而法幣制度亦非常堅强，加之國際的利害關係極其錯綜，戰前法幣在華中的流通額約在十萬元之上。欲把華中法幣打倒，談何容易。於是對於華中貨幣戰，日本學者政治家間亦意見紛紜。不過在初期他們的主張和政策，大體上約可分為三個階段：</p>
<p>（一）法幣擁擠時期</p>
<p>上海南京相繼淪亡，華中的中日貨幣戰接着也就開始。不過當時日本滿以為「支那」的屈膝指顧問可望而欲打倒法幣又覺非常困難，况法幣係可熱得外匯之良貨，於是日本學者間便大多主張（法幣擁護論）以為欲期華中財界安定而偽政權基礎鞏固，莫善於積極擁護法幣。蓋法幣若一崩潰，華中中國國民經濟力亦即隨之破壞，不僅偽政權要受到打擊，那日本的經濟也要蒙受有利影響。不但如此，如果對於法幣加以壓迫而使其價値慘跌，結果必為第三國所憤慨而有礙及「東亞新秩序之建設」云。</p>
<p>這種論調，眞覺可憐！其理論之對否，我們無須批評，因為這不啻日本對於法幣不戰自降也。可是我們要知道在戰事初發之時，這派的努力最盛而且反映於日本對華貨幣政策上：在一般的人看來，這似乎有些意外，其實在稍為經濟學識的人看來，是很平常而必然的，因為這一片可憐的呼聲，是脆弱不固的日本經濟基礎之反映。這樣，華中貨幣戰的第一聲，日本復無條件地自行投降於法幣之前了！</p>
<p>（二）法幣放任時期</p>
<p>日本學者因自知其經濟基礎之脆弱，而不得不主張「法幣擁護論，」然而這是一個很大的矛盾。因為日本正和國民政府作戰，而反擁護其所發行的法幣，使其經濟益見鞏固而助長其長期抵抗成功：這眞是一幕滑稽劇。因此，不久，日本學者便由「法幣擁護論」而退為「法幣放任論」了。他們的主張，是法幣固不應加以擁護，然亦無須加以破壞，不仿任其自然，結果因國民政府之抗戰失敗而自趨崩潰消滅。</p>
<p>這種主張，一時曾很得勢。可是事實上和前一說並無二致，不過五十步與百步罷了。因為不管你擁護也好，放任也好，法幣倒底是信用鞏固而可買取外滙的良貨，絕不會如日人所夢想的將行崩潰。况且放任法幣在「佔領區」中流通，又何嘗不是在替國民政府維持法幣？這種半悲半喜的滑稽怪劇，虧得他們日人演得出。然而自知經濟基礎脆弱而法幣信用鞏固，有何法可想呢？</p>
<p>（三）法幣利用時期</p>
<p>日人對於法幣，擁護也不好，放任也不好，於是無法之中，便想出辦法來，「法幣利用論」是也。這派的主張是：過去日本因把「滿洲國」和華北拉人日圓集團，以致日本對於這些地方的輸出，和國內貿易沒有多大分別，在獲得的貿易反受了不利的影響，因為對於這些地方的輸出，和國內貿易沒有多大分別，在獲得外貨上絲毫沒有好處可言，質言之，日本對於「滿洲國」和華北的輸出貿易，對於日本國際貸借的改善是無補於事的。故這次應將華中除出於日圓集團之外，而以法幣為通貨，使日本的輸出可由這一條路獲得法幣，再以法幣來套貿外滙。</p>
<p>這一派的理論亦有其是，而且日本亦曾採為政策。可是不久便吿失敗，原因是他們沒有想到日圓在華中的特殊情形。因日圓與軍用票在華中之濫發，已使其統制價格一先令二辦士的日紗跌到和黑市八辦士的法幣價値相等有時甚至較低，這種不能獲得外匯的日圓和軍票，無論是誰，都想早些脫手，於是日本在華中之對華貿易，實質上便大多以日圓為收付手段，而法幣利用論也落了一塲空。不僅如此，在理論上，藉法幣以套取外匯，一方面固有破壞的力量，另一方面却又足以提高法幣的價値和地位。</p>
<p>總之，在華中的貨幣戰，日本始終不得不承認法幣之穩定與價値，故在貨幣戰上，節節敗退而無條件的投降於法幣之前。（未完）</p>
<h3>物價高漲中的資金疏散問題</h3>
<p>— 吳澤金</p>
<p>上海物價的步步高漲，已成為目前此間最嚴重的現象，本刊前曾堅請各位學者專家們詳細討論，研究其原因，及其穩定辦法，各位先生發表宏論高見的很多，不過，其中似乎並不有具體而實際的建議和辦法。</p>
<p>佐據筆者的意見，上海物價的高漲，原因固然是多方面的，如因生產减少，供給减少，人口集中，外匯黑市塲的成立等等，不過除掉這幾種原因外，上海通貨流通量的相當膨脹，無疑也是物價高漲主要原因之一，前次座談會裏，有幾位先生，特別是聶光地先生這樣說過，「戰後上海流通籌碼不獨不及戰前的多，而且似乎較為緊縮」，這或許是指八一三戰事剛爆發後的情形，不過自國軍西撤後，各地的富有者，都集中到上海，隨着他們來的，是大批資金，戰後各銀行存款的急劇增加，及現時市面上充滿景氣投機的氣氛，都是確切的明證，因為資金的　集一隅，便造成了現時的特殊繁榮，也就是造成了現時物價高漲的局面，所以要平穩物價，除對上述的其他原因，研究方案對付外，對於如何使　集於上海的剩餘資金，適當地疏散，似乎是更應努力的。至於疏散的方法，筆者見到的有二點：</p>
<p>一、由政府發行一種為調劑上海金　而設的短期金融庫券，授權於中中交農四行推行，四行當就上海實際需要的流通籌碼外，儘量利用此項庫券吸收一般游資。這種辦法，並不是新創，在一九三四的英國，也曾運用這種辦法來解決他當時的金融過剩的恐慌，不過在現時的上海，這種辦法是有困難的，第一因為上海是個淪陷區，雖然這裏有租界，不過政府債券，環境還是否允許公開推行，第二是巨額債券的推行，容易引起人民的誤解而對法幣懷疑。</p>
<p>二、由各銀行組織一大規模銀團，鼓勵並吸收一般富有者的資金，作有計劃的內移，此項資金由各銀行給以相當年限相當利率的担保，同時政府再向銀行保證利益，這種辦法，可以引起一般資產者對內地投資的興趣，因為過去他們的資金，所以寗願滯留上海而不敢內移，主因在於對內地的隔閡和無把握，現在旣有各銀行担保利益，他們一定會樂於租助的。同時銀行則由政府保證，也是有益無損的。</p>
<p>此外如中中交農提高同業存款利率，吸收同業休資，各銀行提高定期存款利率，减少流動性質之活期存款，並拒絕以款項貸下一般投機和操縱居奇的商人等等，也都是相當可以减少游資穩定物價的辦法。</p>
<p>以上幾點，不過是筆者的一得之見，不能算是建議，希望注意上海資金開　者，再來一次詳細的討論研究，這裏不過聊供一過參考。</p>

<h3>滙價平準之轉變（續十七日）</h3>
<p>— 盛慕傑</p>
<p>總之，日本直接或間接在上海套買外滙，確是上海外匯上的一大壓力，據上海銀行界的估計，平準基金差不多有四百萬英鎊是耗用在上海，而內中二百五十萬英鎊是被日本以金融的或貿易的方法所侵奪去。（註）這種估計，當然不能置信，但上海的暗市再維持法幣的價値，實在變成對法幣的打擊底方法了。</p>
<p>（四）新的水準和限制賣出的推測</p>
<p>由此而論，此次平準會暫停供給外匯，任令法幣自然趨至較低的水準，確屬一種必要的手段。路透社八日電傳負責方面說明中英平準基金不援助法幣的理由：「基金於七日暫不予以援助，俾使法幣匯價得與更好的經濟價格相適合，而促成貿易額平衡，…一九三八年六月間曾有此同樣步驟，迨旣得八便士之價格後，匯率圓滿維持歷十二個月之久，現信新價格業已獲得，而可予以堅强的維持」。現在的問題便宜是新的水準如何？將來限制的方法如何？</p>
<p>就市面上的行市和匯豐銀行的掛牌價來看，個人的意見，英金六便士半和美金十六元六二五，大槪即是法幣滙價的新水準。先看市塲上的收盤價：</p>
<p>八日以後，行市卽趨穩定。更看滙豐銀行的掛牌：</p>
<p>亦是八日以後，即趨小動。市氣果眞不佳，必不會停止在六便士半以上，同時平準會若認為此價尚未達到更好的經濟價格，滙豐掛牌價亦不會就停止動起來。依照過去的經騐，去年暗市匯價從一四·二五便士落到八便士，約貶値百分之四十，現在從八·二五落到六·五便士，約貶値百分之二十，前後約共貶去百分之六十，已是一個很低的水準。再低則對於英美的對華貿易有關，平準基金委員會想早已熟悉及此了。</p>
<p>其次，不管新的水準如何，假使對外滙的賣出，凡以一元法幣申請者即給與六便士半，則對於貿易底入超雖在某種程度內能予以改善，但對於防止日本的套買，仍然無法禁止。是則不論法幣滙價如何即低，偽幣對法幣價値如何賤，日本總可以不値分文之紙幣晚得一筆可貴的外滙也。故橷水準旣得，而新的供應方式亦要隨時實施。報載滙豐銀行限制供給暗市外匯後，對於各業正當的需要，憑定貨單仍舊供給，這種限制方法還有未妥。　意新的供應方法，要合乎最切需要而不致間接被日本利用去底原則。否則法幣一元即値一便士，日本亦要套買的。—六月十日—</p>

<h3>男子不能生育　應用科學方法補救之</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>歷來行家族制度的東方民族，結婚的主要目的，首在生子；要是不生子女，就要發生離婚等情。但是據現在醫學上攷察，不姙的原因，並不專在女子，男子曾姓淋病及陰痿等症，也能使生殖機能發生障碍，蓋淋病可使兩側的睪丸和畫睪丸發炎，致精子缺乏，不能姙孕，有時雖把淋病極力治好，然主宰必慾的靑春腺，减低其作用，因而晚罹腎虧。</p>
<p>老人容易腎虧，這是生理上的關係，關於勃起中樞的興奮性減却而來，要是年輕的人，除却房事過度，手淫斵傷，致發生腎虧外，厥為早年荒淫染毒所致。</p>
<p>男子腎虧之後，在精神上常顯不安狀態，例如頭腦賬痛，健忘失眠，腰酸背痛，心中　悶。常常遺精。在房事上亦有病態發現，如卑洩陰痿，結果構成婚後不育的主要原因。</p>
<p>吾人之所以繁衍子嗣，為的是維持夫婦間的愛情，亦所以保全家庭的和平，享受家庭的樂趣，但要這樣，一定先要增强性慾機能，要是一方面患有上述各症，（女子不能生育的疾病，以月經不調為最普遍。）那末夫婦之感情終究不能融合，但此種疾病的治療，一定要用最新科學方治來補救，今旣明瞭本症於靑春腺之斵傷，則對症治法，莫善服以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，蓋「補體康」為德國生理學家梅倫博士所發明，其中成分採自動物之睪丸與卵巢，凡早衰，腎虧，房事不能，勃起力低弱者，即一服用，卽顯驚人效果，功能補腦，補腎，補血，年老人服之，可返老還童，其女用者功能調經種子，凡子宮疾患，均所對症，備為中外醫家所信賴，可說為腎虧之特效良劑。</p>

<p>猖獗數千年之淋菌，現在已屆最後之末路。此種驚人之升學上的新紀錄，應完全歸功於德國淋病學大師彼得博士，在彼得博士未發明淋病特效藥「史淋儂」之前，其支配治療界中者，不過化學療法，及透膜殺菌療法兩者而已。而吾單臨床家對於此兩種療法，不免時起失望之感。因化學療法，其所具之副作用甚為强大，故雖有一時殺菌之功，亦得不償失。而且往往服用之後，有不快之預後。至於透膜殺菌，見名思義，亦不過僅於粘膜微具殺菌作用，但因淋菌來勢之凶橫，此種微弱的殺菌作用，無異杯水車薪，全無根本解決之望。因此吾輩臨床家每為之感到棘手。</p>
<p>然否極泰來，終於有「克淋儂」一藥之發見。凡服此藥後，于數掌上明珠內，全體細胞即發生抗淋噬菌的作用，所以淋菌藏匿之處，「克淋濃」殺菌的作用亦即發之而生。基於此種原理，淋病患者，不論淋菌分布何處，皆可由此種偉大之殺菌作用所肅淸。舉凡淋毒性之攝護腺炎，精囊炎，前後尿道炎，膀胱炎，關節炎等症，服「克淋儂」後，即以顯微鏡每日檢查血液，則其淋菌無不逐日减少，而白血球則增加其噬菌的機能。因而新舊淋病在短期中完全治愈。至於外用藥方面，男子可同時外用「抗淋水」。女子淋毒白帶，可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，按圖或說明書在家秘密自療，奏功尤為迅速也。</p>
<h3>肺病初夏療法</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>初夏的天氣，忽寒忽冷，如不經心，病人體易受影響，使肺病的惡化；又能惹起合併症肺炎，氣管支炎，急性腸加答兒等，為預防起見，患者必須與秋季一樣的當心，隨時注意天氣的變化，預備衣服，尤其對於藥物療法，不宜怠忽，肺病患者除必須隨時注意攝養之外，宜每日進服德國肺病特效聖藥「補肺拿爾」則體質增强，抵抗力亦因而堅盛。蓋「補肺拿爾」功能除痰止咳，凡為肺炎菌侵蝕之肺癌損傷，服此卽可恢復原狀，因成分優良，一年四季中均可服此，凡患肺病者，須宜注意。</p>
<h3>處理病理遺精的超特療法</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭靈</p>
<p>遺精能喪失吾人健康所必需之精血之故，故一致認為危險而有隱憂，但若屬於生理，則危險較少。所謂病理的遺精者，其勃起與射精，不在普通狀態之下，排出精液，乃一種不快之精液漏出是也，大抵其初起於睡眠中，有時雖將精液排出，而仍不自覺，必俟醒後褲襠潤濕，始知遺精，其時間亦有間隔，有每星期一次者，有三日一次者，如遺數頻繁，則健康前途尤為可慮！</p>
<p>遺精之原因，多數由於手淫過度，故欲治療遺精，須村絕手淫惡癖，然後施以對症療法，如睡前服以法國遺精專藥「耐而斯遺精片」頗有超特功效，良由該劑功能蓋固精關，安靜大腦神經，服後不致誘發淫夢。此外之電療，攝護腺按摩等，亦有輔助治療之功。不過患者若因遺精而體質虧損，或素患神經衰弱，腎虧等症，則應兼服德國梅倫博士所發明之睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」則補腦，補腎，補血，均有其不可思議之良效，此為現代最進步之補劑。</p>
<p>淋病瑣談</p>
<h3>尿道淋之鑑别與治療</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>治林毒如果鑑别不精往張冠李戴誤致險境</p>
<p>必須用極科學方法始能始可不迷病之變狀</p>
<p>治療淋病之道，首重認症之正確。而鑑别之工作，不可不首先愼重之施行也。今以後尿道炎而論。即可知余説之不謬矣。淋菌侵入後尿道時，多因個人之性質環境而有差異。然能將入未入之時，予以迅速而適當之療法，庶免病菌之區域，日形擴展。而變症百出矣</p>
<p>一般淋濁，自前尿道至後尿道之經過，其淋菌多繁殖於粘膜上之表面，雖漸次從前方擴張至後方，但無寗謂爲在仰臥，或生殖器勃起之際，膿汁從前方逆流至後方，因而致擴大淋菌之區域者爲多。又因患者之不攝生與醫師行不熟練的手術，致淋菌侵入後尿道者，甚多。故患者必須十二分之注意。</p>
<p>治療本症，必須有精密之鑑别，始能應付裕如。惟治療亦頗困難。因吾人之前尿道中的淋菌，非精密的檢查，絶難鑑别也。前有王玉潤君患淋病已數易其醫，屢服成藥，均不見效。乃求余治療，經用二杯試騐法，及顯微鏡檢查，知爲後尿道炎，即用德國静電療法，一方佐用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」爲內服劑，使匿處尿道內部之淋菌，全部肅淸約三星期即全根治。迄今三年未發　診時上午十時至下午六時。每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角。並贈價值一天之「性病全書」一册</p>

<h3>米價昨又狂漲　租界當局不應漠視　漲價原因全係投機操縱所致　存米固豐各地來源亦未斷絕　—奸商枉顧平民生計應嚴懲—</h3>
<p>上海豆米市塲米價飛漲、創新高峯、米業團體、呈報租界當局、請迅籌善後辦法、取締投機操縱、疏通來源、而免影響社會安寗及市民生計、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>米價飛漲　創新高峯</p>
<p>豆米行業市塲因囤戶投機操縱、鉅額繼續扒進、致價格在漲創歷來新紀錄、昨日上午九時開市後、市塲交易、紊亂異常、常熟特白粳漲至二十一元七角新高峯、中决各米、均在漲一元許、市塲管理委員竭力向客戶勸告、切勿作米之投機、而免影響整個民食、而投機者依然操縱、致米價無法降落、且囤戶以外行居多、各管理委員甚爲棘手、已將經過情形、呈報公會、</p>
<p>呈報當局　建議辦法</p>
<p>豆米行業同業公會、巳將米價飛漲、及投機者操縱米市等、呈報公共租界工部局法租界公董局、望迅予採取有效辦法、　對投機者操縱米市、迅予取締、　疏通內地來源、以維租界內之民食、各米業領袖曾作非正式之會商、認爲外行操縱米市、米業團體、巳無能爲力、惟有靜待租界當局予以善後、同時並飭市塲管理委員會、在可能範圍內勸告客戶出售、以維民食、</p>
<p>邀集行號　竭力勸告</p>
<p>市塲各管理委員會會於昨日午後、向一百零五家行號勸告維持民食、穩定米價、以及疏通來源、並採用間接或直接、勸各囤戶不再扒進、而免米價再行狂漲、但各行號雖已表示接受勸告、惟能吾收效、殊難預料、至於連日到米、雖較前銳减、但來貨並未完全斷絕、例如昨日河下來源雖寥寥無幾、水陸兩路、計常州．崑山．運到三千五百包、每包的合一石五斗、</p>
<p>存米有五　十餘萬包</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨特往訪米業某領袖、據談、市塲米價之飛漲、實爲意料所不及、因際此將近黃霉時節、囤戶出此、極爲危險、所囤之米每易發霉、所以內行米商、決不敢囤積、而外行不明原委、竟冒險囤積、以圖厚利、目前上海租界內存米、據調查存於各銀行堆棧以及各棧房者、總的有五十餘萬包、以中國銀行堆棧居多數、浙江與業。中國實業。等銀行决之、</p>
<p>整個民食　無缺乏虞</p>
<p>至於居民預購之米、雖無法調查、但估計亦有四五十萬包、所以上海之整個民食、決無缺乏之虞、民國二十六年冬季之米荒情形、決不致重見於今日、但米價之飛漲、迫近二十二元、依理而言、實屬不當、囤戶之投機操縱、如能設法取締、則市塲米價、自能抑平、惜米業團體權力不及、無法執行、惟有希望租界當局出而干涉、吾則恐米價再行飛漲也、</p>
<p>滬商在海防　建置堆棧　同益船行堆棧工竣　源泰琳亦自備關棧</p>
<p>海防現爲轉運貨物集中之重鎮、貨蓮之繁盛、實爲空前、故區區彈丸之地、待運物品、堆積如山、當局雖極力設法疏通、無如車輛缺乏、一時不易辦到、至於海關關棧註冊等手續、因海關特別認眞、欲得註冊者、亦甚困難、即太古。怡和兩公司、亦只得自行派遺江輸駐泊海防、作水棧躉船、以便運往之客貨、暫爲存儲、本市新開之</p>
<p>同益船行</p>
<p>係華綸洋行．天祥洋行與中希輸船公司．等華員所識組、該行徐麗生何惜玉兩君、對於航務、經騐豐富、交際廣闊、因見海防貨運關棧過去之困難情形、事前特托維泰洋行大班李活、赴</p>
<p>海防覓地</p>
<p>自建巨大堆棧、現已工竣、於上月中旬及本月初、已連開漢蘭力號安山號兩輸、直放海防、運去貨物八千餘噸之鉅</p>
<p>聞源泰琳</p>
<p>分行、總行設海防、亦自備註冊關棧、近租得安利凱馬勒輸一艘、儎重六千餘噸、爲穩妥起見、祇限裝貨四千噸、即日起簽發關單、定二十二日結關、二十三日直放海防、</p>

<p>不必出此</p>
<p>也、午後、有刺鐵絲網自兩軍用卡車卸下、英兵二十名、戴皮手套另架障碍物、但工作甫經開始、即奉令停止、乃將鐵絲網移去、午後曾有便衣與衣制服之日軍官乘汽車、數度行經該地、但未下車、昨夜九時、英哨兵三名、駐守大西路彼側、警務處人員外人一、與華人三、</p>
<p>駐該局前</p>
<p>大西路南側一英人花園內架一營帳、選駐大西路之英兵暫宿帳中、警局附近雖未禁止行人交通、然行人寥寥無幾、毘連警局之街口、架有鐵絲網障碍物、然居衖中者仍可自由出入、</p>

<h3>梵王渡頭　訪卜舫濟先生（上）  NC</h3>
<p>在島卜舫濟先生訪問記以前，值得以童稚心情，回溫十餘年前的舊夢。</p>
<p>上海兩個最高學府—聖的翰與南洋，於十餘年前，每年冬季，總得有幾回足球比賽，其盛况好像哈佛與雅魯，非但兩校的校友和同學，到塲助威，就是社會人士，也特別起勁，認爲是一件大事，多抽閒半日，遠道往觀。記得有一年，將近聖誕節的前兩個星期吧，叉輪着我們遠征，大家喫了一頓早中飯、浩浩蕩蕩，沿着虹橋路西行，直奔徐家滙車站，一個個上了專軍，半小時後，我們南洋的拉拉隊，已經在聖的翰隔河的球塲上怒吼着。</p>
<p>這一次，於萬分危險之中，我們贏了一個球，大家高興得發在，帽子在半空飛舞，其熱烈情緒，至今猶憧燎着。我還記得，在歸途中，我拉着兩個同學步行，不曾坐火軍。我們從憶定盤路轉到徐家滙路—現在的海格路，一路上說着笑着，冬天的薄暮，特別可愛，從極遠的樹林中，望到數抹紅雲，爲了貪看晚景，絲毫不感覺倦意。</p>
<p>當然囉，聖的翰也嘗嘗贏我們的，他們的同學，也於歡欣鼓舞之中，踏着長送歸去。</p>
<p>人生最值得回味的是過去，在今天到聖約翰大學門首，這些往事，又引起我無窮的倜悵！我們的母校呢？</p>
<p>愚園路一帶，在仲夏中，街樹顯得分外葱綠，馬路光滑得可愛，車子疾馳着，沒有異樣的感覺。一轉灣，將近上海西站時，情鱟却大非昔比了，臨風飄展的旗幟，殘缺不全的房屋，我眞怕看，我眞不願意向窗外張望，幸而這短短的一段路，不過於三分鐘裏消失。再一轉灣，靜靜地，灣曲地；一條綠蔭四覆的小路，在我們的前面，同時，我又望見蘇州河，好像遇見故人一樣，一顆心頓時寗靜下來。</p>
<p>S君和我，總是結伴的，訪問卜舫濟先生，常然他也得同去。將近聖的翰門首時，校役們已將兩扇大門拉開，我們取出名片，說明要訪問卜校長</p>
<p>「是老卜先生麼？」一個穿制服的校役問。</p>
<p>「唔！」我們有點好笑，大概他們是這樣稱呼卜校長的。</p>
<p>校役立在踏板上，算是領路，我們便在卜先生的住宅前下軍。</p>
<p>一看錶，正是一時五十分，距卜先生的我們二時會見的時問，尚有十分鐘，我們在廊前徘徊着。</p>
<p>「老卜先生睡午覺呢，不曉得曾睡醒麼？」屋裹的一個校役說。</p>
<p>這裹眞美麗，眞幽靜，一片廣漠的草地，參差掩映的大樹，把四周環境襯托得很古雅，很自然。這四圍的景色，顯示出和平；靜穆的氣象，一點不俗，一點不過火。我最怕看財富人家的園林，一切都是新的，有點觸目驚心，此處所見，完全是古老的，聖約翰倒底是一個世家呀！人類的智慧，從天賦者半，從環境養成者亦半，聖約翰畢業的學生對於社會國家的貢獻，無疑地，多是從古老的環境中，優良的訓練下養成的。</p>
<p>在草地的遠處，我們望見，一條騾子，正拖着刈草機，幹着剪草的工作，我們曾見過馬達刈草機，或者用人力。以騾子代勞，還是第一次看到。綠色的原野中，有這條騾于點綴着，也可以增加不少自然的情趣。</p>
<p>於是乎我們被引進會客室，這是對着扶梯的一間，一切的佈置，使我有些驚奇，這裏的簡單陳設，古意盎然，一張長條桌，是老中國式，顯得不俗。靠窗有藤製的長沙發，上面鋪着淡綠色的坐墊，和紗窗外的交柯綠葉，互相影射着。這間屋有點像山上的Bungalow，這是鄕間隱居的生活。</p>
<p>壁間，有一副木製的對聯，寫的是：</p>
<p>「茶香紫筍露，</p>
<p>琴韻白蘋風。」</p>
<p>我們正在出神欣賞間，主人下樓的脚步聲，打斷我們的思索。</p>
<p>卜老先生看上去不像七十五歲高齡的人，頭髮是霜白了，精神很覺矍鑠，頎長的身材，和靄的容顏，和十餘年前的樣子，沒有顯然的改變。</p>
<p>大家寒暄了一陣，主人延我們到他的辦公室去。</p>
<p>這四周見方的辦公室中，我們竟然尋不出一件摩登的傢具來。辦公桌子相當大，三面圍着邊，在這張桌子上，不知道卜老先生消磨了幾許歲月？</p>
<p>火爐邊，有兩張藤椅並立着，對面是一張較爲舒適的大椅，承主人的好意，堅囑我坐上去，他說：「這是客人的椅子呀！」</p>
<p>壁上有何紹基寫的聯語：</p>
<p>「稻秧正靑白鷺下，</p>
<p>桑椹爛熟黃鶴嗚。」</p>
<p>在兩聯中間，還懸着「樂琴書趣」的橫額，在這間古色古香的辦公室中，懸着這樣好的聯語，在現在季節申，格外恰當。我們向四圍看看，不是稻秧正靑麼？不是桑椹爛熟麼？</p>
<p>門畔，更有一張道地的中國式長書桌，上面堆着很多的書籍，像這種形狀的桌子，在上海，是不容易覓着的。</p>
<p>S君和卜老先生並肩而坐，談話從申報開始。</p>
<p>卜老先生是申報的老友，他說：Shun　Pao　is　thebest　paper　in　Shang-hai」</p>
<p>他對於申報去年的停刊，表示非常欽佩而又惋惜，他年年到靑島去避暑，總是通知校中把申報按日寄去，所以數十年來，天天和申報見面。他以爲申報態度公正，文字雅純，隨時代不斷進展，是中國唯一的領袖報紙。（以下由S君續</p>

<h3>紀念高爾基逝世三週年</h3>
<p>— 歐之譯</p>
<p>——譯自蘇聯「文學曆」——</p>
<p>三年前，一九三六年的六月十八日，我們這一代最偉大的作家高爾基逝世了，——他是死在戰鬥的崗位上，是被法西斯蒂的走狗毒死的。莫洛托夫在高爾基追悼會上說：「在列寗之後，高爾基的逝世，對於我國，對於人類是最沉痛的損失。」</p>
<p>九十年代初期，當無產階級革命鬥爭的火焰花俄國日益明朗的燃燒着的時候，當偉大的布爾雪維克黨奠基的時候，高爾基挾着他的最初的作品出動了。</p>
<p>高爾基來自人民大衆的最深層，據他的知友羅曼。　蘭說，他從小便吃盡「組成彼奴役的無產階級的命運的那種貧窮和屈辱。」他永久和工人階級保有密切的關係，「他是我國以及全世界勞動者無產階級社會中義文學的眞正始祖。」（莫洛托夫）</p>
<p>高爾基說：「文學家以爲文學是他的私事，……這是最有害的胡說。文學從來沒有是史登台爾或是托爾斯泰的個人私事，文學永久是時代的，國家的，階級的事業。」高爾基的創作是工人階級的事業，是俄羅斯人民的事業。同時它也是整個前進人類的事業，因爲高爾基是巨大的世界範圍的作家，是屬於一切民族和一切國家的工人，農民和愛自由的如識份子的·沒有一個文學家的名字比高爾基的名字在全世界無產階級中更爲聞名，也沒有一部作品像高爾基的母親這樣被各國工人更喜愛。</p>
<p>隨着馬克斯，列寗和史太林，高爾基對於創造的佔有過去的文學遣產，給予無量的意義。高爾基跟俄國和世界文學的大匠學習許多，他是俄國和世界文學最好傳統的承繼者和繼續者，他是售文學和蘇維埃文學之問的活的聯系。</p>
<p>他從前進的古典文學裏承繼了它的人道主義，以及它對於人的尊敬，注意和愛護。但是他並不停止在社會主義時代以前舊文學最光榮人物在這方面所達到的那種階段上。他又向前走了很遠，他成爲社會主義的新人道主義的創導者和熱烈的保護者。（下略）</p>
<h3>隴海綫上（上）</h3>
<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>從商邱到蘭封</p>
<p>村野間已充滿了夜的氣息，天上閃爍着星粒，照耀着微弱的光綫。</p>
<p>我們一行四人，伴着一隻藏有重耍東西的公文箱——它由一個弟兄負擔着。靠了星光的助力，在曲折的小徑上行動；兩旁叢生着麥稈，在星光下搖曳着，我們就在這麥影蹤橫的麥隴上快速地穿過。</p>
<p>負着重擔的弟兄，愈走愈快，我們的脚步，也隨之加緊。勁都集中在兩腿，誰都沒有開過口，寂靜的空間，祇有單調的擔干在吱陝地伴奏着輕快的脚步聲。我們的目的地商邱車站，就在這種加速度下到達了——</p>
<p>跑進車站，阿發突然活躍起來，他首先發現車站前，正順馴地躺着一排車頭向西的列車，喜得跳了起來，大聲地呌着：「我們的運氣眞不小呀！」靜寂的空氣，給他打破了！</p>
<p>「且慢歡喜，我想沒有那麼便宜的事吧！」老俞對這列車並不抱着樂觀。</p>
<p>我們把行李和公文箱，放在一邊，由弟兄擔仟警戒，然後跑近列車。</p>
<p>車箱裹沒有燈火，在黑暗中閃動着一大堆黑黝黝的人頭；他們是國家的細胞，現在正在覺醒中開始摸索的羣衆。問他們什麼時候開到這裹，他們的回答是說：已過了兩個夜了！</p>
<p>我們跑進站長室，站長忙着在電話機上工作，手裹的筆，迅速地在紙上滑動；他微笑着向我們點點頭，意思楚在招呼我們。</p>
<p>「請問站長，前面那輛車，什麼時候可以開動？」我待他話筒剛離手的時候，就發問。</p>
<p>「這車是沒有一定的，因爲向東的車太多，而且更需要，西行的就不能預知了……」</p>
<p>「那末今夜有沒有傷兵車下來呢？」我打斷了他的話，接着又問。</p>
<p>「傷兵車嗎！——」他翻着剛才給筆滑過的簿子。「——有，大概在十二點左右。」話很肯定。</p>
<p>「那未我們就等待這輛車吧！」我回顧其餘幾個同志。從經騐中知道，傷兵卓比較迅速，在每站躭擱時間很少的，他們都沒有異議。</p>
<p>候車是件最無聊而不耐煩的事，我們要使時間過得快一點，就同站長隨便談起來，他很會說話，像個圓滑的大腹賈。</p>
<p>但道方法並不覺得有效，我拚命抽着烟捲，一根接着一根，烟尾和火柴，聚了一大堆，壁上的鐘，還是那麼悠遊自得地不肯前進。</p>
<p>好容易又消磨過了二個鐘頭一電話中傳來了一個可喜的消息，說傷兵車巳從前站開出。但到這裏却要近一點鐘了。</p>
<p>四五節車箱，已載滿了爲正義而掛彩的同志，高談着在前綫認爲得意的事；有些使勁地揮動着負傷的臂膀，忘掉了肉體的苦楚；不時發出高大的笑聲。雖然在子夜，但他們並沒有倦意。</p>
<p>我們爲不願侵佔他們的權利，更爲了不願使他們冉擠一點，決定把我們的行李和公文箱，抬上車頂去，人也就在弓形的車頂上躺下了。</p>
<p>列車在站長的哨子聲中慢慢地蠕動；我們在兩旁樹木的夾縫中駛過，身體平躺在車頂上，欣賞着銀白的天，閃動的星，迷糊的村野，幾天來的倦意，給它征服了。想起了上海夏天乘凉夜班的渡輸，我們忘了自己的處境。幾乎感覺到自己又在夜渡輸上顛簸。</p>
<p>在夜的微風中，身子感得有些冷意，把身旁的軍毯蓋在胸前。倚在公文箱上的弟兄，已打起輕微的鼾聲，車繼續在樹木的夾縫中直駛。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>危樓</h3>
<h3>糊塗論</h3>
<p>— 卞洛</p>
<p>「糊塗」在現代社會上大抵認爲一種並不十分壞的缺點，比起「作惡」來似乎還强勝一籌；如說某人借錢賭光，那是一時糊塗，若是持刀刦財，便有點「作惡」了。但也有糊塗受人稱贊的，「讀書不求甚解」，「不求甚解」便有點「糊塗」了，可是經陶淵明這麼悠悠然一來，反而贏得大家稱譽，似乎糊塗也有藝術。像普通所稱酒鬼，大抵有點糊塗而受人指責的，但李太白就不然了。鄭板橋說過什麼「難得糊塗」，可說提倡糊塗了，如今還有人津津樂道，可見天下事原是各有巧妙不同的。</p>
<p>糊塗也有眞偽之分，所謂名人隱士之流的糊塗，大都不是「眞痴」，而是「佯在」。李太白除了吃酒外，還會哼哼什麼「雲想衣裳花想容」之類，因此至今酒家也還想以「太白遺風」作號召。而劉阿斗倒是個「人生得意須盡歡」的實行者。而且此問樂，不思蜀」，也是他的老實話，却被人笑駡至今。實際上，不管你糊塗的眞偽，若希圖以「淸高」「隱逸」或其他的美名來掩飾自己糊塗的苟安，也終是白費的，劉阿斗是應被笑駡的糊塗蛋，但在現代，再欲借糊塗以逃脫，也祗能證明自己的沒落。</p>
<p>天下最多的便是自作聰明的糊塗蛋，他們不單自己糊塗，而且希望別人和他一樣糊塗。「與虎謀皮一該是理想的傻瓜了。而偏有對虎叩頭求饒，以求憐憫，或送上點猪肉牛肉或自己的一手一脚，希圖給虎一個滿足，等到知道上了虎的當時，該眞一誠地請求獵戶了，偏又怕打盡了天下的老虎，弄得世界太淸靜了。天下很有這樣的糊塗蛋。至於自己的泥足已站不穩，却還希望打得別屈膝，其　雖可嘉，但實在却是糊塗的低能了。</p>
<p>又若掛上一付和平的面具，發一套兩敗俱傷的胡言，不管是非的屈直，想以投降作苟安，這類人尚不能糊塗逃脫他的罪名，歷史上不乏先例，但結果是什麼呢？曰「遺臭萬年！」</p>
<p>有這樣的笑話：「有個多事的人對跪在岳王墳前的秦檜與王氏像起了憐憫，將它們拆了丟在河裏，免得終年受人侮辱。豈知當晚做了一夢，夢着秦檜與王氏來謝。晨起一想：秦檜有這般靈騐，岳王若有靈，又將奈何？連忙去河裹撩起來，重復叫他們跪在那裹，此後不復有人去拆它，成了萬刧不復。」笑話是無精的，愛憎却很明顯，秦檜看上去也很不聰明，而那多事的人也並不糊塗到底，終於淸醒過來，明白了俗人所謂正邪的道理。我希望今之善心人，不會如此糊塗！</p>
<h3>印象的山遊（續）</h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>道士引我們仍舊登上石級，預備回到馬路。他忽的止了步，呌着：『法柳，法柳！你在那裹鬧什麼……早些把柴擔回來喳！』</p>
<p>我們朝道士的視點看，發現深深的雜草中間，有些變動，有個孩子的聲音嘟噥着。我們在注意的時候，道士却做個沒事的神氣，說：「沒什麼，沒什麼，我們往是祇管走。」</p>
<p>走不二三十級，一個和尚，野牛一樣的從草叢間扒起來，抄着小徑逃走了。</p>
<p>順着馬路再上，不三里，有個尼菴。當我們走過那陰沈沈的尼菴門口，我就想：爲什麼這裹也會有尼菴呢？</p>
<p>折過石級，發現了一座潔白的石亭，這就是「半山亭」。原來被稱道的所在，祇爲的有要人題字，這亭子確建得不壞，可是這麼孤獨，叉不當路，很容易使遊衆忽略。</p>
<p>從半山亭橫過馬路，順着道士話別時的指示，我們一再攀了兩重石級，來到一個名稱不顯的別墅。出來照呼的也是儈人打扮的男子，但一股市儈空氣，使我想到他着上袈裟的時期還不久，這假和尚領我們看了一會房子，讓我們留在窗外的階邊，乘乘風，看看山景。不久，茶也端了上來，假和尚說：</p>
<p>「我們的老闆是江西人，開藥材行，很有些錢在手裹，這房子是爲他自巳憇暑蓋的。」</p>
<p>「我們並不打算租，」大彭說。</p>
<p>房子的建築還好，遙遙對着東西兩山脈間的谷底，能看到葱綠和屋宇的繁盛。可是，巧妙的半山停雲，這裹倒泯滅了；同一高度，同一視點，偏有這麼不同的變幻！</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>從江西人別墅出來，再曲折里餘，我們找着了唐朝李靖隱居山莊。屋子大的是經過多决修葺的，那麼古式，雖然柱梁上新刷了油，壁上新塗了白粉，仍然體會不到一點近代意味。竹林那麼修雅，屋後的山崖那麼挺秀，遊西湖時，較之抱朴子的山廬的孤零情况又不同多了。但屋子裹寂無居人，階上，留有一把稻草，兩面燒焦的磚，一堆雞毛，一些灰燼。不知是某個行人曾到這裹來野宴，還是大呌化煨雞所留的痕跡，吃得精光光的。</p>
<p>懶懶地，穿出山徑，再沿馬路前進。</p>
<p>遠遠的處所，有杜鵑的聲音，像由谷底農家的地方傳來。但途程至此，土壤的成份漸少，磽确的巖層漸漸多了。視野所到，濃翠的密度愈變稀疎，逢春不呈生　的荒澳斷崖，也漸漸增多了。</p>
<p>「先生，好心，化個緣，破費些吧。」</p>
<p>「破費幾個吧，先生，大德大量！」</p>
<p>着長衫子的呌化子追隨在我們後面，但都是本處的貧農，矯健，　黑，沒有什麼病態，吾則他們生活在這離地面有二十多里的高岡瘠地，是不容易的。我們願意分些糧草給他們，因爲他們不是沒有生存希望的，他們還健好，應當有意義的生存。病廢，殘缺，應交託把死神管束：可是我們却得援助有生存力量的人類。</p>

<h3>關於西南少數民族的立法問題</h3>
<p>— 丁裕長</p>
<p>凡是到過我國西部邊疆遊歷或曾涉獵邊驅史地的人，都知道我國民族，除了漢，滿，蒙，回，藏五族以外，還有許多少數民族分佈於西部各省區。大略說來，如雲南的獵玀和擺夷，西康明番族，貴州的苗猺，廣西廣東以及湘西的猺獖，海南島的黎族，四川舊建昌道八縣（現隸西康省）的夷族…合計不下數百萬人。尤以貴州一省為最，全省人口有「漢四苗六」之語。上述的少數民族，如與新疆甘肅一帶的回族，西藏靑海的藏族番族，蒙古的蒙族，和東三省極邊未漢化的滿族合計，當不下二三千萬人。在我國因漢族人口的龐大，所以比較起來，仍是一個小數目。這些少數民族，據人種學的研究，其血統上和漢族最為接近。且因歷史上的戰爭和商業的關係，在政治上，經濟上和文化上和漢族有密切的關係，可是一方面却仍保持着他們特有的文化及語言，並未完全漢化，即以法律而論，歷代法律雖經施行於各省區，繼續保持他的統一性，但對於上述的少數民族，大都視同化外，並未嚴格的實施，即在今日亦尚如此。</p>
<p>歷代中央政府對於西南少數民族（包括苗，猺，黎，玀玀，擺夷等）除了保持宗主權以外，任令其統治者管理其部族，除了朝貢和戰爭以外，極少直接的接觸。他們又不如滿族，蒙族曾人主中夏，統治漢族，曾於法律上自居於優越地位，如金代於法律上規定「種人」，「漢人」及「南人」三階級，元代分「蒙古人」，「色目人」「漢人」及南人四階級，淸代分「旂籍」及「漢人」等階級，以壓迫漢族。他們的經濟生活，大半滯留於漁獵，遊牧或初期的農業社會。以唯物史觀的見地而論，他們的意識形態，自囿於部落的或封建的範疇，與我們漢族已進入於工商社會者不同，所以我們漢人創立的法律，自難一律適於此等少數民族。自晋末五胡亂華以迄唐，宋，元，明，淸，漢族不斷以武力來征服他們，壓迫他們深入西南山岳地帶。唐代以後，常封其降服的部落首領或征伐有功的將士為他們的世襲的官吏，建立了土司的制度。土司在其所封建的部落內為最高唯一的主宰，而一人漢官衙署即處於最低的地位，這種封建的土司，對於其部屬，有「朕即法律」之槪。在其治下的少數民族，隨其喜怒，而有生殺予奪之權，中央政府或地方流官絕無顧問之例。以致此種民族日處於水深火熱之境，時起叛亂。經淸末實行「改土歸流」的政策，逐漸取消封建的土司政治，改組的正規的地方政府，解放此種少數民族；使居於齊民之列。凡是改土歸流的地方，所有少數民族，十九均已漢化，甚難保持他們的文化。但到了現在，邊疆各地，仍未能完全消滅這種封建的土司政治，即有名義上的已設流官的地方，因當局設施未善，仍形同虛設，實權仍操於舊有土司的後裔，也數見不鮮。所以這些少數民族的身分，在事實上並未與漢族平等。約法上規定中華民國國民一律平等，無男女，種族，宗敎，職業之別，在西南各省，可說並未貫徹，決非過言。</p>
<p>過去西南各省，在政治上積極的為少數民族謀解放的首推廣西。而少數民族被漢化最快又最普遍的亦為廣西。數十年前桂西大部均為土司統治，今日除了柳江和桂江中間的猺山，尚留若干猺族部落以外，已無土司政治的痕跡。雲南省政府則在西部邊疆，分設西康建省以後，據說對於與漢族素不往來的夷族（處於舊建昌道八縣）也將設局感化。足見抗戰以後，因政治重心移至西部高原，中央對於少數民族解放工作，正積極推進。</p>
<p>我們固然應將處於封建土司壓迫下的少數民族解放，使其漢族在法律上及事實上處於平等地位，但我們應否使他們消滅固有的文字的言語而澈底漢化，却是一個可以商榷的問題。對於西南少數民族的立法，原則上自應根據孫先生的遺敎，而在技術方面，我們希望政府對於下列各點，加以考慮：</p>
<p>第一，中央及地方立法機關，似應有各少數民族的代表參加，使他們對於本族的特別立法，儘量貢獻意見。</p>
<p>第二，法律上應確認少數民族的文字和語言的效力，對於漢字含有侮辱或輕視的民族名稱，應禁止使用，以融和民族的情感。</p>
<p>第三，少數民族集居的區域，似應各劃為與漢族不同的『法域』。現行的民刑商法，應各視其經濟生活及文化水準，並顧及其固有的善良風俗，酌定施行的範圍。或竟另訂單行法規，俾有實施的可能。</p>
<p>第四，土司制度自須廢除。對於少數民族的生產建設，敎育文化，必須特別立法，助其發展。</p>
<p>我們相信，根據孫先生遺敎的立法，必為西南少數民族解放的開始。</p>

<h3>票據上之簽名得以畫押代之乎</h3>
<p>— 王效文</p>
<p>依照票據法第二十一條，第一百二十一條之規定，滙票·本票·及支票之發行，均須由發票人簽名，而其他票據所為，如背書·承兌·保證等等，亦莫不以背書人承兌人保證人等之簽名，為必要之條件。蓋因依照票據法第八十二條之規定，票據到期不獲付款或不獲承兌時，執票人於行使或保全票據上權利之行為後，對於背書人，發票人及票據上其他債務人，得行使追索權，而依照票據法第二條之規定，凡在票據上簽名者，又須依照票據上所載之文義，負其責任，如票據債務人於表示意思時，不以簽名行之，則執票人於行使追索權時，將無所依據也。</p>
<p>是則票據上之簽名，應以明顯為上，古文化字，在所不取。但查票據法第三條之規定，則票據上之簽名，竟得以藍章畫曾代之，實不知其用意之所在。以蓋章代票據上之簽名，雖有異於通行文字之釋例，猶得謂為一般人所認識，而以畫押代簽名，則畫押之種類式樣，溫無標準，必使執票人無法推知其為何人所畫，對於票據之流通以及追素權之行使，實多妨礙。在民事行為，因有特定之當事人，當事人之簽名，即使依照民法第三條第三項之規定，以指印十字或其他符號代之，尚無窒　不通之處，而認票據上之簽名，得以畫押代之，殊嫌有所未便。</p>
<p>票據上之簽名，旣得以畫押代之，則不識字者亦得援用民法之規定，以指印行之矣，是烏乎可。故愚見以為票據法第三條之畫押二字，實有刪除之必要。至銀行公會向立法院提議蓋章二字下加一或字，則亦無關重要也。</p>

<h3>覊押人犯簽中兵役應准保外服役</h3>
<p>刑事覊押人犯，抽簽中服國民兵役者，在兵役法施行條例，旣無禁役或停役之規定，又無其他足資依據應如何辦理，頗有疑義，前經司法行政部呈請司法院核示茲悉二十七年十二月十九日司法院指令第二六六三號令司法行政部云查兵役法施行暫行條例，業經軍政部於本年四月擬具修正草案，呈奉軍事委員會指令暫准施行在案。該條例修正草案第三十條第一項載，現役及齡而有左列事項之一者，得展緩其入營之年期，稱為緩役，其第五款，因刑事嫌疑在迨訴中尚未判中者，仍受國民兵役之敎育及召集各等語，依此規定，刑事羈押人犯抽簽中服國民兵役者，如在應受敎育或召集之期間，自應准予保外。（下略）</p>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>— （馮美學）</p>
<p>（問）甲於民國二十四年娶乙婚後，即不和陸，一年後，乙即離甲家，迄今踪跡不明。（一）可否依據民法一零五二條第五項及第九項規定，向法院聲請調解離婚？（二）可否不經調解手續？（三）可否將調解狀或起訴狀和聲請公示送達狀同時送法院？（四）先登報三日，限其一星期內表示意思，通知住址？此項催吿，可否作聲請公示送達及惡意遺棄之證據？（五）如一經登報，乙即歸家，而甲不願收留，仍欲起訴離婚，是否合法？（六）一造辯論判決，其聲請用書狀，抑言詞？（汪珊）</p>
<p>（答）（一）民法第一零五二條第五款，指惡意遺棄者而言，就來函所述情形，尚不能即認為惡意遺棄。至同條第九款指生死不明，已逾三年者而言。丙雖離甲家，然或在母家，或母家知其所在地，不能遽指為生死不明。（二）離婚案件，依法應先聲請調解。（三）如有調解可能應先請調解，俟調解不成，再行起訴。如確係所在不明，方可聲請公示送達，如乙在母家，或母家知其所在地，即不應聲請公示送達。（四）所登之報，乙是否見及，尚難預必，殊難以此為證。（五）在合法離婚以前，甲無拒絕收留之理，就所述情形，根本不應離婚。（六）可以言詞聲請。</p>

<h3>犯罪最便宜的時季</h3>

<h3>全滬電影院將加映　「安全第一」影片</h3>
<p>— 筠</p>
<p>韓蘭根桑淑貞都做臨時演員　說明滑稽「推板一眼眼險　」</p>
<p>「一九三八年在上海所發生之道路意外案，竟有一萬五千八百十硬件上之多，因此死亡者二百十三人，傷者四千九百五十三人。」這是多末驚人的一個數目！</p>
<p>為了司機者和行人雙方偶一的疏忽，竟發生這樣驚人的不幸事件，可是人們却從來不注意怎樣可以避免這種不幸事件的發生。最近丙租界警備處推行的「安全第一」運動，就是注意到司機者和行人的合作，才能避免這種不幸事件的再見，自從推行以來，他們加派了巡崗在十字街頭指導和糾正行人和司機者的行路規則，並且得用無綫電播音及各種娛樂場所，時時向人們忠告「安全第一」的意義。</p>
<p>最近並由矮克發科達及新華影業公司的合作，攝製了一卷「安全第一」的電影。全片共長一千三百尺，開映時大概需時十分鍾，今天起，或許全滬各電影院都要加映這卷影片了。</p>
<p>昨天早上，警務處先執行各報記者在大光明映演一次，因之，我也得先覘為快。</p>
<p>這卷電影的內容，和兩租界佈告的「安全運動」告白一樣，不過實地表演，讓大家在腦膜上深印着這種不幸事件是怎樣發生的，同時，怎樣才能避免掉。</p>
<p>新華影業公司的演員如桑淑貞，韓蘭根等都做臨時演員，這幾位銀幕上常見的丑角的表演，將使人更深刻地留着「安全」的印象。</p>
<p>說明者據說是陳大悲先生，用上海話，而且相當滑稽。如小孩子在路上游戲是最危險的，畫面上是一眾孩子在踢球，追逐的時候，一輛汽車從後面駛來，孩子不及避讓，輾傷了，說明主：「這孩子是三房合（格）一子啊！」</p>
<p>再有脚踏車後面不能裝載重量的物件，否則重心的不能均衡，車身會東歪西倒的，這樣後面汽車來的時候是很危險的，於是說明就：「脚踏車上為啥裝價多東西？」</p>
<p>其他如警告行人不能在車輛前面穿過去，不能呌對街的黃包車等等，在畫面上映出了因此所發生危險的時候，就說「險　？」</p>
<p>「推板一眼眼！」</p>
<p>所以，我覺得用電影來宣傳，其　效一定比加派巡崗，揭貼佈告等大得多。因為每一個司機者和行人，不出事前，都以為自己的開車和走路，決不會發生什麼不幸的，而發生之後，雙方又得互相推諉，以為咎在對方。現在這「安全第一」影片就清清楚楚告訴雙方面，什麼時間，什麼地位是會發生危險的，並利用開麥拉眼深深地印進腦海裡去。</p>
<p>於此我們知道電影的宣傳力量是大於文字的，那末，我想以此為牟利工具的商人，此後還可以用什麼理由作為「遁辭」呢？</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　綠窗談愛重締良緣</p>
<p>潘佩英今天得着了一個天外飛來的喜訊，是在她心中以為永遠不能再見的人，却復活了起來了。這真是所謂生死人而肉白骨一，這一喜真是喜出望外。聽袁淑文如此說，可以明白趙爾天的沒有死，却是千真萬確的了。但不知道樂天此刻却在那裏，這是潘佩英民中所急欲問的。正待動問，袁淑文又接續着說道：『趙先生也在無錫，你沒有知道嗎？聽說他從前的老太爺，是開過米廠的，好像那個地方是在雪堰橋。現在趙先生繼承父業，有個全國民食委員會，各省都設立了民食護節委員會。無錫一向是個糧米集中的地方，戰前也是個米市薈萃之所，戰後更加繁盛了。趙先生聽說已由蘇省的民食總節會，派他在無錫專管米糧調節事宜。我只知道個大略，也是他們偶然說起，詳細情形，可就不得而知。』潘佩英想：　『果然他在雪堰橋，那就一問便知。確是近來政府為了民食問題，很加以一番努力。這個問題，在欠中國，是幾千年來的一個大問題。我們小時節，還讀着孟子上的一段書道：一河內凶，則移其民於河東，移其栗於河內。河東凶亦然。可見古時節，常常有移民就食的，大概是為的運輸不便。運輸不使，就為交通不發達，往往一個地方擁塞，一個地方缺乏。持着地方狹隘主義的，同為本國的人，甚而至於也會遏疑起來。在戰爭期中，更不必說了，還有奸商等從中搗亂。到了戰後，這民食是第一件事，鑑於三十年前，蘇聯大革命以後鬧的饑荒，不能不慎重注意了。這調節機關，就是使出米的地方，不至於擁塞，而不出米的地方，不至於缺乏。並且也要使運輸得宜，各　方的米介於價値，可以平衡。無錫本來是個出米的區域，但它每年所出的米，僅敷本地所需。因為無錫現在比較繁庶，又是工廠區域，需米更多。但無錫一向是個米市所在，糧食集中之地，所有碾米廠等等，都在此地，因此蘇省調節會，要特派人員駐紮此地了。』（一四○）</p>
<h3>「人造棉」</h3>
<p>— 疁人</p>
<p>穿過幾天拉長五六寸　洗過幾次質料起毛頭</p>
<p>隨着天時的轉變，護身的衣衫亦得更換一下吧！皮袍子，駱駝絨的，該早安放在箱篋裏，就是夾的，也不合時了。所以這幾天單長衫和單旗袍是再適合也沒有了。只要你稍此注意一下馬路上來往着的人們，誰不是穿起漂亮的所謂「派立斯」的長衫嗎？可是，不幸得很，一個惡劣的現象使發生在這時候。</p>
<p>原來，人們為了要在經濟上打算一下，一塊多錢一尺的「真派立斯」買不起，（少數資產階級例外），但是却又要學時髦，於是，不得不去找代替品。有一種用「人造棉」仿製的「假派立斯」，便行銷一時。無論男人的長衫，女人的旗袍，市是已相當的流行。大概因為這種「人造棉」製造的東西價格相當便宜，不過三四角一尺就夠了，比那一塊多錢一尺的「真派立斯」，自然合算得多。但是，請你仔細觀察一下，這種「人造棉」是那國貨的品？是國貨嗎？哼！那你可上當了！</p>
<p>據一位熟悉此道的友人告訴我，市是發售的這種假冒「派立斯」的「人造棉」，並不是國貨呀，你們千萬不可去上當，他們利用它低廉的價格，來博取一般人的歡心！說也兩愧，事實上上當的朋友却不少！</p>
<p>「還有一種劣點」，那友人告訴我：『這種「人造棉」，起初穿　的時候還好，但一過三四天，它會伸縮性地拉長起來，至少比原來的長上五六寸，那時，不但不雅觀，并且行走又不便。』</p>
<p>「要是洗過一次或二次，那質料便會起毛，多洗又不經穿。」他繼續着說：「一般人為了眼前的便宜，而却忽略了日後的麻煩。」</p>
<p>朋友！你聽了上面一席的話，作如何的感想呢？假使你還有良心的話，總該有所覺悟吧！</p>

<h3>Informal Exchange of Views Among Britain, France, and the United States on the Tianjin Incident; Britain and France Highly Value the Attitude of the United States; Hull Meets with the French and Soviet Ambassadors to Discuss the Tianjin Situation; American Public Opinion Advocates Strong Actions to Support Britain and France</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the situation in the Far East and the negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Sir Phipps this afternoon to discuss them. Afterward, he also had a long-distance telephone conversation with French Ambassador to Britain Corbin. It is reported that Britain, France, and the United States are currently exchanging views informally on the Tianjin incident. However, those in charge here place great importance on the attitude of the United States, regarding it as a determining factor in future developments. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to well-informed sources, Secretary of State Hull and his staff reviewed the Far East problem with concern last night. The State Department refused to comment on the issue, but there is widespread fear that the current deadlock in the Far East will be broken this weekend, leading to explosive actions that will inevitably directly involve the United States. It is believed here that the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident is very slim. It is reported that Hull will meet with the French Ambassador this week. In recent days, Hull has met with the British Ambassador several times and has also consulted with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew, who has returned from Japan, on the Far East problem. Non-official circles expect that the U.S. will not take any action until the content of the decisions of Britain and France is clarified. It is said that the United States intends to let Britain and France initiate the action first, and then take action. This is because in 1931, the United States initiated action first, but the European democratic countries did not provide subsequent support. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, State Department officials have stated that the matter involves the United States no less than it involves Britain and France. Therefore, the United States has complete sympathy for these countries. Generally speaking, the State Department believes that without American support, the two countries may not be able to genuinely do anything to Japan. However, the U.S. government still intends to wait until the attitude of the British Cabinet is clearer before deciding on a course of action. The reasons for this are twofold: 1. To exchange views with the British and French governments to understand their true intentions. 2. Not to make any hasty expressions that would hinder the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendments. The general public believes that Japan's decision on this matter is part of a grand plan, the ultimate goal of which is to remove Westerners from Asia. Those who comment on current affairs in semi-official circles, although saying that Germany and Italy may not have had any formal consultations with Japan on the Tianjin incident, point out that the arguments used by Japan are consistent with those of Germany and Italy, and the newspapers of these countries all support Japan's actions, so it is almost certain that the three countries are colluding. President Roosevelt and various spokespersons for the U.S. government have repeatedly stated that Germany, Italy, and Japan constitute a triple threat, and this has now been confirmed. At present, traditional anti-Japanese sentiment is once again clearly visible in public opinion, and it is generally advocated that the United States should take strong actions to assist Britain and France. Most newspaper editorials say that it is inappropriate for the United States to continue trading with Japan and call for a boycott of Japanese goods. Even the isolationist Daily News advocates that the British and American navies jointly blockade the Japanese coast. The consensus of public opinion can be seen in this. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently received French Ambassador Saint-Quentin and Soviet Ambassador Oumansky separately today to discuss the situation in Tianjin, China. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, the government authorities are maintaining close contact with the United States and the self-governing colonies, especially Australia and New Zealand, regarding the possibility of imposing economic sanctions on Japan. Among them, the attitude of the United States is highly valued here and regarded as a determining factor in the future development of the Tianjin incident. At the same time, the government authorities are continuing their efforts in the hope that the Tianjin incident can be resolved through diplomatic channels. Therefore, official circles here are quite pleased with the news from Washington that the White House may step in to mediate the dispute between Britain and Japan. However, it is still believed that if Japan formally demands control of the foreign concessions in China, the United States will undoubtedly take joint action with Britain and France to impose economic sanctions on Japan. At that time, as Japan's main creditor and largest customer, the United States will make a significant contribution to retaliatory measures against Japan. In addition, if sanctions are implemented, the entire British Empire must participate unanimously to be effective. For example, the Commonwealth of Australia's trade with Japan accounts for 60% of its total foreign trade. After the implementation of an economic blockade, it should sever business relations with Japan. The Union of South Africa should also stop importing its wool to Japan. The wool produced by the Union of South Africa and the Commonwealth of Australia is of much better quality than that produced by South American countries. Once it stops being sold to Japan, the country will inevitably feel a significant impact. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) British cabinet members are all awaiting developments in the Tianjin situation tonight. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain is spending the weekend in the countryside, he is in constant contact with his residence. Foreign Secretary Halifax returned to London from Berkshire today to pay close attention to recent developments. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax returned here from Berkshire this afternoon. Despite the weekend holiday, he is still working in the capital, which shows the seriousness of the diplomatic situation, as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are conducting negotiations in Moscow, and the Tianjin incident shows no sign of easing. Regarding the Tianjin incident, the British authorities have not yet made a decision on whether to send warships to transport food to the British concession in Tianjin, pending action by Lieutenant General Noble, commander of the British fleet in China. In addition, the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday morning to review the general situation. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain is spending the weekend in Chequers, he is maintaining close contact with the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Government Considers Continuing to Loan China £3 Million</h3>
<p>(London) According to diplomatic sources last night, in retaliation for the Japanese military blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the British government, in addition to implementing other strict economic sanctions, is also planning to provide China with greater financial assistance. While Britain and France are still discussing the Tianjin crisis, the British government has considered a plan to continue lending China £3 million for the purchase of military equipment and other military supplies from Britain. The loan had already been decided to be paid, but it was delayed because China did not have collateral. The British government no longer insists on this condition because the British government is looking for the most effective way to retaliate against the Japanese blockade. British political circles hope that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai will find a way to prevent the expansion of the serious incident between British troops and "Great Way" police yesterday, as the Shanghai crisis is most likely to involve the United States, causing the United States and Britain to take consistent retaliatory action against Japan. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian claims that many believe that one of the purposes of the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin is to force Britain and France to stop transporting military supplies to China via Burma and Annam to supply the Chinese army in its war against Japan. Therefore, it is generally believed that the best way to deal with Japanese intimidation is to strengthen aid to China. (Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japan Declares Opposition to British Invitation of Third-Party Intervention</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese news agency reports, Japanese officials announced that if Britain takes immediate and active steps to protect its interests in China, Japan will inevitably take necessary measures to deal with the new situation. According to the Japanese government, the statements made by British authorities are intended to gloss over the serious mistake made by British authorities in stubbornly refusing to hand over the murderers in the Cheng case, who should have been extradited long ago. Japan can never accept Britain's attempt to invite a third country to intervene in this kind of issue. Britain's proposal of this plan at the last minute is completely inconsistent with the actual situation. What Japan wants in the current incident is a thorough improvement in British policy in China, as expressed in the refusal to extradite the murderers in the Cheng case. This policy of Japan has nothing to do with the policies of other countries related to China and is not as Britain says it is. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese political figures recently declared that concrete solutions to the Tianjin incident should continue to be handled by the local Japanese authorities. The Tianjin dispute is purely a conflict between Britain and Japan, so Japan believes that it is not appropriate for Britain to try to involve third countries. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The opinions expressed by semi-official Japanese sources yesterday can be regarded as a response to Britain's potential imposition of economic sanctions on Japan. Semi-official sources here criticized the British statement that "Japan's demands affect the interests of treaty nations in China" and stated, "If Britain really takes active steps to protect its so-called treaty rights, Japan will be forced to take necessary measures to adapt to the new situation." (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Times Advocates that Action Must Be Swift</h3>
<p>(London) The situation in Tianjin, China, was recently commented on by the Sunday Times and the Observer weekly. It was said that the door to negotiations is not yet closed, but if Japan expresses covetousness towards the foreign concessions in China, Britain will respond with the strongest action. The foreign affairs reporter of the Sunday Times said, "The current situation is not suitable for resolving with slow-moving economic means. In other words, the government must act quickly. At present, the path of negotiation is not yet blocked. The Tianjin incident is only a matter for the British and Japanese authorities. There is no plan for Britain to take action to invite the United States to cooperate. "However, if Japan insists on its demands and creates a stalemate and threatens the interests of all countries in China, the most serious situation will arise as a result. At that time, since the United States and France have the same interests as our country, the United States will inevitably take action to protect its interests. It can be asserted. Now, Japan is asking Britain to cooperate with it to establish its so-called 'New Order in East Asia.' It is impossible for Britain to agree. Other demands from Japan that seek to effectively control British concessions in China are also unacceptable to Britain." The foreign affairs reporter of the Observer weekly said, "Regarding the issue of the extradition of the four Chinese in Tianjin, Britain has suggested organizing a joint committee to resolve it. This proposal has not been withdrawn, so the current dispute can still be treated as a local event and resolved. However, if the Japanese government does decide to raise more far-reaching issues involving the position of all countries in China, the British government should do everything possible to defend its position, as it did in the past and still does today. At that time, it is not uncommon for the United States and France to take parallel actions." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Criticize Germany and Italy for Instigating Japan to Provoke Britain</h3>
<p>(Paris) Hard News today claimed that, according to Italian newspaper reports, the current Tianjin incident is part of a grand plan already formulated by the Axis powers, aimed at destroying democratic countries. However, the news received in the capitals of Britain, France, and the United States is not the same. According to diplomatic sources, Japan has decided to limit the scope of its actions. The Paris Times is not optimistic about the Far East incident. Its editorial states that there is an idea that Germany and Italy feel that they will eventually have to fight on two fronts, and now they are recruiting Japan to join what is in fact an alliance of three countries, and instigating Japan to provoke Britain under the guise of protecting purely Japanese interests, in order to divide the strength of democratic countries. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet newspapers today broke their silence on the Tianjin situation and published discussions stating that Tianjin and other recent incidents involving British people in China are merely pretexts used by Japan to create conflict. The real reason for the current tension in the Far East is Japan's desire to expel Britain and the United States from China and seize public concessions in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Tianjin and Danzig</h3>
<p>The Tianjin problem of today, whether examined under a microscope, revealing its essence; or viewed through a telescope, reflecting the perceptions in the hearts and minds of the world, when compared in scale and importance to the Danzig problem, which has long been the focus of international attention but has not yet stabilized, the significance of the Tianjin problem is undoubtedly deeper and its implications greater. Danzig is a free city; its legal status is subordinate to Poland, but its political potential is tied to Germany. The problem is: Germany demands it, Poland refuses. The back-and-forth of the problem lies between the gains and losses of the two parties. The impact of the problem lies in the future struggle for dominance in the Baltic Sea. The main actors in the problem are Germany and Poland, and the European countries take sides. The Tianjin problem arises from Japan's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, which affects the French concession. What will be decided by this is: (1) Whether Britain and France will de facto recognize the Japanese military and puppet regime in North China; (2) Whether Britain and France will maintain the Tianjin concession; (3) Whether other foreign concessions in China will be maintained; (4) Whether the rights and interests of foreign countries in China will be maintained; (5) Whether foreign countries will withdraw from the Far East; (6) Whether the policy of foreign aid to China will be abandoned, that is, whether the act of aggression will be recognized; (7) Whether the Nine-Power Treaty will remain effective; (8) Whether various treaties related to the Far East can be unilaterally revised. In summary, will the relationship between Western countries and China, which has been built over the past century, be allowed to be monopolized by Japan and come to an end? As for the extradition of the four suspects and the prestige of Great Britain, the problems are insignificant. In the Danzig problem, Germany takes the offensive in politics, propaganda, and diplomacy, while Poland takes the defensive. Currently, there is almost no development in action. In the Tianjin problem, like a game of chess, Japan has made the first move, and Britain has made a countermove, using diplomacy as an unimportant "ko" and economic action as the "eye-filling" to determine the overall victory or defeat. Japan only gets Germany's cheering for the Tianjin problem and does not get effective assistance; just as Germany only gets Japan's empty sympathy for the Danzig problem and will never generously form an alliance due to anti-communism. Regarding the dispute over Danzig, Germany's ally Italy publicly claims to help Germany but secretly advises Germany not to be rash; but once there is a split, Italy will fully assist Germany. Regarding the Tianjin dispute, Japan's ally Italy praises Japan's courage, and the Roman forum cannot help but express its desire to participate in the division of spoils; but once there is a split, whether in the economic or even military aspects, Germany and Italy cannot help Japan in the slightest. Poland, in order to oppose aggression, has formed an alliance with Britain and France and shown goodwill to the Soviet Union. Its ability to maintain Danzig is actually sheltered under this overall situation; if something happens, it will at least be a war in all of Europe, and it will soon be a war in the whole world; only because of this, everyone is not rash, so there will be no war; even if war is unavoidable, even if Danzig is used as a fuse and war is fought, it will definitely not be fought for Danzig. Britain has not obtained an alliance on international treaties in the Tianjin incident, but the expression of playing the zither and singing, the posture of rolling up sleeves and rising up, has already been seen on both sides of the Atlantic; why is this? Common interests are at stake, and the obligations of treaties are considered to be more powerful.</p>
<p>However, the outcome of the Tianjin problem cannot be said with certainty; in previous comments on the matter, it was said that Britain has three demons: the isolationists in the far-off United States, the arrogance of the near-by Soviet Union, and the self-esteem and self-deception within; these three make Britain lose its enterprising spirit, and there is no necessarily followed method for solving the Tianjin problem. In recent days, the general situation remains like this; what can be used as new information for analysis is: although the United States has no substantial formal expression, yesterday Secretary of State Hull met with the French and Soviet ambassadors to the United States for the Tianjin incident, which can be regarded as a subtle prelude. That is one. The isolationists in the United States pay more attention to European affairs and despise Japan in the Far East; and the Daily News, which has always been biased towards isolationism, yesterday commented that it also advocated that the British and American navies blockade the Japanese coast; that is the second. Western public opinion generally regards the attitude of the United States as a factor in determining the Tianjin incident, and this is why the United States is held morally responsible, and it has its own value; but last night's news from Washington seemed to indicate that what the United States is considering is not the question of whether or not to take action, but whether to hope that Britain and France will take action first and the United States will follow, or whether the three countries will take action in parallel; that is the third. Then, is the key in the United States? If so, and the United States turns a blind eye to the Far East and stays out of the matter, what will happen? This is indeed a major deviation and is worthy of attention; but yesterday, a rare argument was found on the British side, because in recent years, the British government and public have been extremely hesitant and cautious in diplomacy, let alone the long-unseen independent action, and also the long-unheard independent argument; but only in the Tianjin incident, the foreign affairs reporter of the Observer weekly said: If Japan really has far-reaching demands, the British government will do its best to defend its position, and the United States and France will act in parallel, regardless of whether it is asked or not; this is a sign that Britain is gradually recovering its spirit of independent action, that is the fourth. These four are not enough to say for sure how the Tianjin incident will end; but they are important data for observing the direction of the movement. The direction of the movement indicates that the United States is less interested in Poland's Danzig problem and more interested in Britain's Tianjin concession problem. This is not only because of the magnitude of interests and the commonality of concerns; it is also because the United States is an advisor to European affairs. Like walking in muddy ground, like falling into a whirlpool, although it takes a lot of effort, it is difficult to expect quick results; if it stands up to stabilize the Far East, this is as easy for the United States as raising a hand or taking a step; in the past, because public opinion was not mature and Britain was not determined, it was delayed; now, it is no longer the same as before.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement Intensifies in Japanese Concession in Tianjin; Severe Shortage of Food in Blockaded Area; Traffic Checks Remain Strict; Residents' Lives Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Today is the fifth day of the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions. The anti-British propaganda movement has become increasingly intense. In addition to publishing anti-British articles in Japanese newspapers, leaflets are also being distributed and non-fee radio broadcasts are being carried out. Loudspeakers have been installed at various search locations. The food situation in the concession has aroused serious concern among the general residents. The stalls in the vegetable markets are all empty. British Municipal Council General Manager Tiber told a Reuters reporter today that although the supply of rice and flour is very sufficient, the supply of vegetables, meat, and fish has actually been cut off due to Japanese ships patrolling the Hai River. The memorial ceremony held yesterday afternoon in front of the graves of soldiers who died in the Boxer Rebellion was quite simple. The Japanese side had troops, representatives from the consulate, and boy scouts, totaling 30 people, to participate. The cars they were traveling in entered the French concession and were escorted by French police to the border of the British concession, then escorted by two British Municipal Council police officers on motorcycles to the location of the graves. When the British ship "Mrs. Maller" arrived in Tianjin yesterday, Japanese search personnel boarded the ship at the Dalian Mail Steamer Company dock to inspect it, but it was not strict. After inquiring about the name, flag, and nationality of the shipowner, they let it sail to the British concession Bund. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ban Mailing of American-Run Newspaper</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Today is the fifth day of the blockade of the Tianjin concession. The anti-British demonstration movement in the Japanese Garden in the Japanese concession can be said to have reached a boiling point, but no unfortunate incidents have occurred in the British and French concessions. Also, at 11:30 this morning, there were reports of violent machine-gun fire, and the residents could not help but be alarmed. It was later learned that the Japanese were just practicing shooting, and people's hearts were settled. Also, the Japanese have already begun to despise the interests of Americans. The English-language North China Star, originally a newspaper run by Americans, has been banned from mailing by the Japanese since Friday. The publisher and editor, Mr. Fox, is scheduled to ask the American consulate to negotiate on his behalf on Monday. The Englishman Smith, who was injured in the head by the puppet Chinese police with a pistol butt yesterday, is still in Japanese custody. Since the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession, food has gradually become scarce, but it is not expected to be in short supply in the short term. However, the concerns of all parties about this are undeniable. According to Municipal Council General Manager Burns (transliteration), the British concession has only enough meat and other food for two days, but a small amount of vegetables still enters the concession every day. As for rice and flour, there is a lot of stock, so there is no need to worry. The ice factory in the French concession also has no problems. Milk is also unlikely to be lacking. According to today's prices for food, meat has increased three times compared to before, and vegetables are virtually impossible to buy. Also, Japanese sentries often only allow Chinese to enter the concession but not to leave the concession. This may be a way for the Japanese to freeload and deplete the food in the concession, or it may be clear evidence that rice and flour are not sufficient outside the concession. As for the claim in the newspapers that Chinese in the British and French concessions refuse to pay patrolman taxes and any taxes, prominent Chinese here have all acknowledged that there is such a movement.

<p>Nearby Strongholds of Neihuang Gradually Recovered</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) The Chinese army in northern Henan has been attacking Neihuang for days. The Japanese army relied on intense firepower and superior fortifications to resist stubbornly, and fierce fighting continued all night. Many Japanese were killed, and Shanyidian, Wangzhuang River Estuary, and other places have been recovered successively. Fifty-one Japanese soldiers were captured, and 51 rifles and handguns were seized. The pontoon bridge at Wangzhuang River Estuary was also burned by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army's return route in Neihuang was completely cut off. At noon the day before yesterday, the Japanese army suddenly increased the number of artillery troops by 300 from the north bank of the Wei River, with four or five mountain guns. They fired more than 200 shells at the Chinese from the Hebei bank, seemingly trying to forcibly cross the Wei River to reinforce Neihuang. After the Chinese officers and soldiers calmly responded, they finally did not succeed. Then, the Japanese army actually released suffocating poison gas bombs, but the wind direction suddenly changed, injuring many Japanese soldiers instead. They are still facing each other across the Wei River. (18th)</p>
<p>Tunxi: The Japanese army in Shuanggou, which belongs to Wuhe in northern Anhui, has been under siege by the Chinese army for days, and many have been injured and killed. The day before yesterday, the Chinese army bravely rushed into the Japanese formation and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. Japanese corpses were all over the streets. The remnants could not hold out and fled in panic. The Chinese army then recovered Shuanggou. (Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Southern Shanxi Retreating Northward; Chinese Troops Fiercely Attacking Anyi and Yuncheng; Intense Battles in Zhongtiao Mountains for Ten Days, Japanese Casualties Reach 7,000; Japanese Troops Invading Zhangdian in Two Routes Repelled</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi are now retreating northward due to unsuccessful advances. Chinese troops are currently fiercely attacking the important Japanese strongholds of Anyi and Yuncheng. Simultaneously, the Japanese troops advancing eastward from Xia County towards Shangjiawei (transliteration) and Jiangjiayao (transliteration) have also been repelled by Chinese forces. Although both locations were briefly captured during the Japanese advance, the Japanese troops retreated back to Xia County after a counter-attack by Chinese forces. Furthermore, Nanlinqiao, a crucial town on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, has been completely surrounded by Chinese troops, resulting in the deaths of over 400 Japanese soldiers.

<p>Yu Ji: At dawn on the 15th, over a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery troops, along with two cannons, advanced towards the western mountains of China in separate routes from Xigan Village on the west bank of the Fen River. The various Chinese garrisons in the area joined forces to resist, and after five hours of intense fighting, the Japanese troops retreated, unable to succeed. It is estimated that over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle, while the Chinese side also suffered over twenty casualties. (Eighteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The fighting in southern Shanxi is intense. Five thousand Japanese troops, divided into four routes, attacked the Chinese positions east of the Zhangdian-Maojindu highway.

According to Chinese sources, Japanese casualties in this battle have exceeded four thousand. Japanese corpses and wounded soldiers are being transported from Zhangdian to Yuncheng and Anyi in southern Shanxi. Meanwhile, according to Chinese military sources, recent joint Chinese air and ground attacks have resulted in over half a Japanese regiment being killed or wounded at Fenglingdu, across from Tongguan. Twelve Japanese cannons were destroyed. It is reported that several squadrons of Chinese bombers destroyed eight hundred Japanese vehicles traveling on the Yuncheng-Taiyuan route. Japanese military installations in Yuncheng also suffered losses. (Eighteenth, China United Press)</p>

<h3>Serious Situation in Tianjin; New Incident Brewing in Europe; Frequent Contacts Between Germany, Italy, and Japan; Danzig Issue to be Triggered First</h3>
<p>(London) According to diplomatic sources here last night, Germany and Italy intend to exploit the British-Japanese crisis in the Far East to initiate a new incident in Europe soon. The two Axis powers originally planned to launch another European crisis after the autumn harvest, as they were unwilling to mobilize troops before the harvest was completed. However, the current situation in the Far East presents a golden opportunity, proving very tempting to the authorities in Berlin and Rome. (Eighteenth, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy have consistently advocated for a German-Japanese alliance. They have recently held repeated discussions with German officials. It is reported that the discussions concern the situation in the Far East, particularly the Anglo-Japanese dispute. Today, the German government mouthpiece, Diplomatic Information, published the first clear implication of German support for Japan's actions in Tianjin, stating that any country that fails to recognize the signs of the times and displays a reactionary spirit in its foreign relations must now experience the inevitable course of natural development. (Eighteenth, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to observations by political figures here, as a result of the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, the British government has been forced to shift its diplomatic attention to the Far East. This development is beneficial to the progress of the German-Italian Axis. They believe that the situation in Tianjin is bound to trigger a very serious crisis, and the fact that this crisis is occurring during the Anglo-Soviet negotiations for a military alliance is of great significance. The Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, is currently staying in Berlin, discussing Japan's policy on the Tianjin incident with the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima. According to sources close to the Japanese Embassy here, "The Japanese side will take surprising actions." However, it was not specified whether these "surprising actions" would involve Japan joining the German-Italian alliance. In any case, observers unanimously agree that there is a kind of political triangular alliance between Germany, Japan, and Italy in the developments in the Far East, which is causing considerable embarrassment to the British side. At the same time, German officials yesterday openly expressed sympathy for Japan. However, the German public still does not have such pro-Japanese sentiments. Yesterday, the German Foreign Ministry's official newspaper, "Foreign Affairs and Politics," called foreign concessions in China "bases for conspiracy" and stated that Italy is deeply aware of this point. (Eighteenth, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano received German Ambassador Mackensen today for a lengthy conversation.

At the same time, Italy's attitude towards the issue of the Free City of Danzig was also discussed. (Seventeenth, Havas)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations Do Not Involve the Far East; British and French Authorities Issue Denials, Claiming German Propaganda Has a Specific Purpose</h3>
<p>(London) Rumors that the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are discussing the expansion of an anti-aggression organization to include the Far East in Moscow have been strongly denied by responsible officials here. They affirmed that the scope of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement remains strictly limited to European affairs. It is said that the intention of spreading these rumors is solely to exacerbate the already tense relations between Britain and Japan. (Seventeenth, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Rumors that the most important issue currently being discussed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow is the extension of the trilateral mutual assistance agreement to the Far East have been denied by responsible officials here, stating that these claims are completely unfounded and are likely a tactic of the German side. Because the Soviet Union is in a special position in the Far East, it declared at the outset of negotiations that the mutual assistance agreement would be limited to maintaining security in Europe, with the main principle being the division of responsibilities between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Western and Eastern Europe. There is no intention to extend it to the Far East, and this remains the case to this day. However, the occurrence of the Tianjin incident at such a crucial time is certainly enough to encourage Britain and France to quickly conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union. Therefore, it can be said that the events in the Far East will indirectly affect the ongoing negotiations in Moscow, but it cannot be said that these negotiations focus on extending the trilateral mutual assistance agreement to the Far East. The various rumors are intended to make Japanese public opinion believe that Britain and the Soviet Union are joining hands in the Far East, hoping to pressure Japan to join the German-Italian alliance. It can be asserted that this is the case. (Seventeenth, Havas)</p>

<h3>Goebbels' Speech: Danzig Must Be Returned to Germany; Claims Polish Theories Are Not Worth Refuting; Great Mistake if Britain Thinks Germany is Weak</h3>
<p>Danzig: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels arrived in Danzig last night and gave a speech to the public as follows:</p>
<p>People of Danzig, I have come here from Germany to convey greetings from the German leader and people to you. You share the same language and culture with the Germans. Here, I am surrounded by German culture and German architecture, and I am filled with German thought and spirit. Your firm determination to return to the embrace of your motherland will not be prevented by anyone. Those who attempt to suppress it and prevent its realization are either reckless and ignorant fools or narrow-minded and jealous individuals, who are not worth mentioning. Danzig has become an international issue of global attention overnight, which was not what you originally desired. What you desired was that Danzig should belong to the territory of Greater Germany. The Polish theory states that a city located at the mouth of a river should belong to the country through which the river flows. Therefore, Danzig, located at the mouth of the Vistula River, should belong to Poland. What nonsense is this! Look at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, does it not lie at the mouth of the Rhine River, and does the Rhine River not flow through German territory? Shall Rotterdam also be transferred to German territory? This kind of argument is fragile and untenable. So why is Danzig so unfortunate that it must be controlled by Poland and cannot freely join the embrace of Germany? British Foreign Secretary Halifax declared in the British House of Commons a few days ago that Britain hopes that the Danzig issue can be resolved through friendly negotiations. Observing Britain's recent words and actions, we can see their insidious intentions, trying to repeat the old trick of encircling Germany as in 1914 and attempting to succeed. They are absolutely wrong if the British think that we are weak and can be bullied. Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party has a wise leader and a strong army, and its strength is sufficient and not to be intimidated by empty words. The illusions and empty talk of Britain and Poland are nothing more than flowers in the fog and a fool's dream in our eyes. After severely criticizing Britain and Poland, Goebbels returned to the topic and said: The people of Danzig have felt a sense of belonging to Germany for more than a day. Since Danzig was forced to separate from Germany, it has harbored the hope of reuniting. Previously, when Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the parliament, he clearly stated that Danzig is one of the German cities, and the people of Danzig long to return to Germany. These words are of profound significance. Hitler has never been one for empty talk, and what he says is always meaningful. Therefore, the men, women, old, and young of Danzig can be confident about the future of Danzig. Germany under the leadership of the National Socialist Party will always be by your side. (Thunderous applause) People of Danzig, people around the world are watching tonight's events. The newspapers of Britain and France claim that you have no desire to return to Germany. The expression of your unity at this moment can give the strongest and most powerful reply to those who spread rumors and make false accusations. Tonight, I, as a representative of Germany, would like to express my gratitude to you. I remember before coming here, I hoped to strengthen your determination. I never expected that your expression tonight would strengthen my determination. How fortunate! I wish our leader long live, the German Danzig lives long, and Greater Germany lives long! (Eighteenth, Haitong)</p>
<p>Danzig: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels arrived here at 8:00 PM today and immediately went to the Grand Theater to watch a dance performance. He also gave a speech in front of the theater to the welcoming crowds, mainly explaining that the city of Danzig belongs to the Germanic people and that Poland has no rights to Danzig. He said, "The citizens of Danzig now have an irresistible and strong desire to return to their great motherland. This desire is a natural response between nations and cannot be stopped by anyone. Only those countries that are full of malice, envy, and lack of understanding will oppose it. You must know that the city you live in has become an important international issue overnight. Your wishes in the past, today, and the future have all been seen by the world, that is, to merge into Greater Germany. (At this point, the crowd shouted the slogan "One Germany, One Nation, One Leader.") It is a pity that the beautiful German city you live in is located at the mouth of the Vistula River. According to the Polish view, all cities located at the mouth of a river should belong to the country through which the river flows. Then, the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands (located at the mouth of the Rhine River) should also be transferred to Germany (the crowd laughed). But we don't have to care about Poland's high-pitched tone. This is just a momentary impulse for them, and it will naturally disappear after a period of time." Minister Goebbels then fiercely criticized Britain, pointing out that it should not give Poland a blank check and attempt to encircle Germany. "If they think that Germany is a weak country, then they are mistaken. It must be known that National Socialist Germany is not only not weak but is already extremely strong. The army we possess is strong and is the champion of the world (the crowd cheered). People who believe that Führer Hitler will retreat under threats and yield under intimidation will commit an extremely dangerous mistake. Therefore, all Germanic people living in the city of Danzig should have absolute confidence in your future. National Socialist Germany will always be your backing. Wherever there are Germans living, Germany will rise up to help them. Now, please take advantage of this holiday to cheer together for the Führer, long live the German Danzig, and long live Greater Germany." At this point, the crowd cheered loudly, and some shouted slogans such as "Jews and Poles should go to hell!" (Seventeenth, Havas)</p>
<p>Danzig City: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech at the "Cultural Week" conference here yesterday. Although it was drizzling that day, no less than tens of thousands of people gathered along the way. When Goebbels was traveling to the venue by car, the people along the way shouted, "We are willing to return home after Goebbels' speech," and "We need to return to the German home." Goebbels' speech said, "The Führer will surely come to Danzig. Germans should return to the German home. Poles cannot forever sanction Germans. The German government will never betray the German residents of Danzig." After Goebbels finished speaking, there was thunderous applause and cheers. (Eighteenth, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Berlin Denies German Mobilization</p>
<p>(Berlin) The rumor of German mobilization is rampant. The Haitong News Agency reporter went to the authorities to investigate the truth. It is said that it is completely untrue. The reports from the British and French sides claiming that the German 8th Division, 18th Division, and 31st Infantry Division, the 4th Armored Division, and the 118th Heavy Artillery Division are concentrated in the Moravian Mährisch Ostrau area, and that the traffic between Iglau and Brno has been cut off are all fabricated and sensationalist. Fundamentally, the German army's organization does not have a 118th Heavy Artillery Division, so how can it be mobilized? By analogy, discerning people can easily see the truth.

<p>(London) The Sunday Dispatch recently reported that German Führer Hitler is preparing to make demands of a shocking nature, which will make the European political situation more serious. According to reliable sources here, there are six demands in total, namely: (1) The Free City of Danzig should be merged into Germany; (2) Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula are vital to Germany's survival, and Britain should completely abandon all political and economic interests in those areas; (3) Britain should return the Gibraltar military port to Spain; (4) Revise the legal status of the French port of Djibouti in East Africa to benefit Italy; (5) Reorganize the Suez Canal Company; (6) The issue of Germany recovering its old colonies should be put up for discussion. In order to have a backing for these demands, Führer Hitler intends to keep Germany in a state of "constant mobilization," accelerate the completion of the third line of defense in the west, and concentrate heavy troops in eastern Moravia and along the border of the Slovakian Protectorate.

<p>British Army to Hold Regular Exercises</p>
<p>(London) The British Army will hold large-scale regular exercises from September 15th to 23rd in "Yorkshire," located approximately two hundred miles from the British military base. It is said that the participating troops will engage in attack and defense according to wartime formations. At that time, the Royal Air Force and tank formations will join in cooperation. The scope of activities of the "Allied forces" and "enemy forces" will be subject to considerable restrictions. Also, when the army is "mobilized," special trains will be opened on the railways and highways from Aldershot to the Yorkshire border to facilitate troop movement. At the same time, strong air force teams will closely cooperate with the "enemy forces." According to the War Office, the period of this exercise is quite long, so the morale of the soldiers will be strained, and officers and soldiers at all levels can therefore become familiar with their scope of work. As for the testing of troop deployment and reinforcement, results can also be obtained. If the "enemy" aircraft can cut off supply lines, the Allied forces will suffer significant difficulties.

<h3>New US Neutrality Act Submitted to House for Discussion, Accompanied by Two Reports</h3>
<p>(Washington) The new Neutrality Act proposed by Representative Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has been submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion after being reviewed and passed by the committee, along with two reports. The report of the majority party of the Foreign Affairs Committee, i.e., the Democratic Party, contains a comparison by Representative Bloom between the proposed new legislation and the current Neutrality Act, explaining that the new bill does not contain provisions for implementing an embargo on arms for belligerent nations, nor does it apply to countries in a civil war. The report of the minority party, i.e., the Republican Party, expresses disagreement with the Bloom proposal's granting the President the authority to declare a state of war and designate war zones, believing that the power is too broad, and opposes the repeal of the current major clause prohibiting arms embargoes. In addition, Bloom is said to have decided to request the House of Representatives to select a date within a week after the 26th of this month to discuss the new Neutrality Act. At this time, people in the Congressional cloakroom say that Republican members strongly oppose it, and some Democratic members who favor isolationism will collude with them, but Bloom's proposal will certainly be voted through.

<p>South Ireland - Military Training Aimed Only at Strengthening National Defense, de Valera's Speech</p>
<p>Dublin - During a recent discussion of the budget in the House of Representatives of the Irish Free State, Prime Minister de Valera made an important speech, stating, in brief, that rumors that government authorities had told people entering military service that they would be fighting against Britain and Northern Ireland were baseless. In fact, the goal of our military training is only to strengthen national defense. The government's policy can be summarized in one sentence: within the scope of our power, we will avoid being drawn into war; that is all. But to maintain a neutral position, we must have sufficient strength. The mission of the country's troops is precisely that. In short, "If people do not offend me, then I will never offend them." Even if war breaks out in the future, we should still maintain commercial relations with Britain, as this is necessary for the economic life of the country. If the enemy believes that it is enough to hinder their hope of victory and obstructs it unreasonably, then we should rise up in resistance to ensure that the country can continue to trade with Britain.

<p>US Army Designs New Military Aircraft</p>
<p>New York - The US Army is now planning to design and manufacture military aircraft capable of flying 500 miles per hour, as part of the US plan to overhaul its national defense to defend against foreign attacks. Staff members are urging aircraft manufacturers to produce blueprints for the world's fastest fighter aircraft so that the US can soon become a country that cannot be penetrated by overseas air raids in terms of technology. The goal is to have aircraft with speeds above eight miles per minute and a non-stop range of 6,000 miles by the summer of 1940. Germany claims to already have the world's fastest aircraft, capable of flying 469 miles per hour. American aviation experts have been aroused by this claim and are trying to improve existing American aircraft with current top speeds above 400 miles per hour. The range of the newest large-scale bomber must also be expanded. Aircraft designs that were considered impossible two years ago are currently under development. It is heard that the US Army is currently building an 80-ton bomber with a special range in Santa Monica, California. This aircraft and a destroyer with a speed of 500 miles per hour will be test aircraft first. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Japanese Troops in Pinghu Indiscriminately Slaughter Innocent Civilians, City-Wide Search Conducted</p>
<p>Pinghu Correspondence - The Japanese army unit of Ishiyama, newly arrived in Pinghu, ordered the puppet magistrate Hu Shufen to supply 300 piculs of white rice and 5,000 yuan in cash every month. Just as the puppet county government was feeling unable to cope, many Chinese army notices were suddenly found around the county government, advising civilians to flee the county seat within three days, as the Chinese army would attack Pinghu. Those who did not flee would be treated as traitors and killed without mercy. Therefore, men and women in the city were greatly alarmed and carried their clothes and bedding, fleeing to the four gates. The Japanese army, seeing this situation, tried to stop them to no avail, so they forced the puppet county government to order that civilians leaving the city would not be allowed to re-enter the city, nor would they be allowed to carry belongings. However, the civilians still disobeyed, provoking the anger of the Japanese army, who immediately closed the city gates and conducted a city-wide search. In short order, no less than thirty or forty people suspected of colluding with the guerrillas were tied up and taken to the city riverbank, where they were dismembered with large knives or stabbed to death with bayonets five or six times. A rice store clerk, who was quite burly, was found with seven good citizen certificates on his person. The Japanese army identified him as the guerrilla captain and immediately cut his abdomen twice with a knife, causing his internal organs to flow out completely. The scene of his death was extremely tragic. Now, the civilians in the city are almost all living in fear, not knowing if they will survive the next day.</p>

<h3>The Straitened Circumstances of Japan's Military Strength</h3>
<p>— Translated by 鑅</p>
<p>From Max Werner's work</p>
<p>"The Military Strength of the Powers"</p>
<p>Japan belongs to the category of "economically weak military states." Japan is not the "Prussia of the East" that it boasts of being, but rather the Italy of the East. It lacks raw materials and its industry is relatively weak. Because modern warfare relies on technological needs, a nation's military strength is ultimately determined by economic factors. An economically weak country can never become a first-rate military power.</p>
<p>Japan's economic system is undoubtedly insufficient in terms of supply. In terms of important raw materials such as iron, manganese, other metals, oil, rubber, cotton, wool, etc., it either has none at all or very little. Japan produces more than half of its copper needs itself, and can produce half of its zinc and iron needs. As for aluminum, tin, lead, and oil needs, it only has a small amount. Its steel industry cannot supply all of its wartime needs. During wartime, its iron needs must be supplemented by 20% of imports. The weakness of its heavy industrial base prevents it from developing into a strong wartime industry. In 1936, its steel production was 4.5 million tons, which is equivalent to between one-quarter and one-fifth of Germany or the Soviet Union's steel production. A booklet issued by the Japanese military stated: "On the eve of this war, we should pay close attention to the impossibility of building a wartime industry. Our current production capacity cannot even meet our general needs."</p>
<p>Another Japanese newspaper stated: "Japan's industry has a distorted development; light industry is progressing, but heavy industry is still in a miserable state. From a military point of view, this is indeed a relatively dangerous situation." (See Eilions du Correfeur) In the book "Japan is Preparing War" published in 1936, pages 285 to 6)</p>
<p>The most important problem in Japan's combat strength lies in its weak mechanical industry and formal wartime industry. The immature development of the mechanical industry shows an insurmountable fundamental difficulty in attempting to greatly develop the wartime industry.</p>
<p>Compared with the powers in this regard, Japan's industry is weaker and less skilled than any other country. It is the only country among the powers that even needs to purchase a considerable amount of military supplies from abroad during peacetime. Japan's wartime industry and mechanical industry are much worse than Italy's, although Japan's heavy industry is slightly better than Italy's. Japan's mechanical industry and wartime industry are comparable to Poland's, but Poland's aircraft industry is qualitatively stronger than Japan's.</p>
<p>Based on the production figures from 1934 to 1936, within the first 18 months after the start of a first-class war – say, a war with the Soviet Union – Japan would have to purchase a considerable number of positional warfare cannons and anti-aircraft guns from abroad.</p>
<p>Japan's production of counter-offensive weapons used in modern warfare is very lacking. The industrial base required for mechanized units is also very weak. Japan's automobile manufacturing industry is very backward, producing only a few thousand cars per year. In 1936, the production plan announced by the Toyada Motor Company was 4,000 cars and trucks. The production capacity of tank factories cannot exceed 3,000 vehicles per year, which means that Japan can never simultaneously deploy 1,000 tanks on the battlefield during wartime. For any number of tanks exceeding this amount, it would have to purchase them from abroad. The situation with aircraft is similar. Japan can produce at most 5,000 to 6,000 aircraft per year, which means that it cannot have more than 1,000 usable aircraft at the same time. During wartime, the production of aircraft must increase by an average of four to six times the number already in use. In this regard, Japan will therefore have to rely on imports for supply.</p>
<p>In terms of the offensive weapons of modern warfare, the true strength of the Japanese army cannot be calculated. As for the large-scale applications planned strategically by the Soviet Union and Germany, that is even more out of the question. In addition, Japan's economic system will be threatened from two sides during combat: one side is being blockaded by the navy, because the Soviet Union's submarine power in the Pacific Ocean is very strong (believed to be much stronger than Japan's); the other side is encountering air raids, because it is now very obvious that after the start of the war, the Red Army can immediately unleash a very strong power in the air. Both of these aspects are very possible and can easily prove the fate of Japan's fragile economic system.</p>
<p>When German officials and semi-officials did not need to worry about future alliances, they unhesitatingly expressed their doubts about Japan. In a first-class war, exactly how many opportunities Japan has is something that very accurately sees the fragile side of Japan's economic system. In 1934, when the Soviet Union's efforts in military progress had not yet been fully noticed, the German "Mililar.Wochenblatt" declared: "During wartime, Japan's political and military opportunities cannot be as favorable to Japan as they should be. When a Japanese-Soviet war breaks out, the result may be the collapse of Japan's economic system, and likewise the collapse of the Japanese army, because present-day Japan has absolutely no hope of achieving self-sufficiency in economic wartime supply." (October 25, 1934, "Militar.Wochenblatt." On October 10, 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War was already underway, the "Erankforterzeitung" said: "Apart from Prine Konoe (Konoe) himself and his economic advisors, no one has pointed out the fragility of Japan's military-economic foundation, which is the result not only of difficulties with raw materials, but also of the insufficient productivity of Japan's industrial tools. The "conflict" between China and Japan provides new proof every day that the Japanese economic mechanism, especially in heavy industry and formal military industry, is very inconsistent with Japan's world political position and its great ambitions."</p>
<p>In a first-class war, Japan has no hope of producing anything in its industry except some fairly well-prepared rifles and machine guns. The production of artillery, tanks, airplanes, etc., even if estimated according to the ordinary standards set by the Japanese army itself, is limited. When the Soviet Union's efforts in military progress had not yet been fully noticed, the German "Militar.Wocbenblatt" declared: "During wartime, Japan's political and military opportunities cannot be as favorable to Japan as they should be. When a Japanese-Soviet war breaks out, the result may be the collapse of Japan's economic system, and likewise the collapse of the Japanese army, because present-day Japan has absolutely no hope of achieving self-sufficiency in economic wartime supply." (October 25, 1934, "Militar．Wochenblatt" On October 10, 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War was already underway, the "Frankfurter Zeitung" said: "Apart from Puice Bonoe (Konoe) himself and his economic advisors, no one has pointed out the fragility of Japan's military-economic foundation, which is the result not only of difficulties with raw materials, but also of the insufficient productivity of Japan's industrial tools. The "conflict" between China and Japan provides new proof every day that the Japanese economic mechanism, especially in heavy industry and formal military industry, is very inconsistent with Japan's world political position and its great ambitions." The difficulties that the Japanese army will experience are not only the result of its fragile economic system. The manpower required by Japan for war is much less than the general needs. The number of trained reserve soldiers in Japan is relatively small, ranging from two million to two and a half million. The number of Japanese regular troops is about 320,000, which is slightly stronger than Poland's peacetime army.</p>
<p>Although Japan's population is three times that of Poland, according to an estimate by a Soviet military expert, only one-fifth of the population can be relied upon for military service, which is being conscripted and trained. The reason for this is the result of the military reform plan implemented from 1923 to 1925, which reduced a considerable number in quantity. The purpose was to reduce the quantity and seek to improve technical strength. The decision was to expand armaments and raise the standards of modern combat weapons in order to compensate for the deficiencies in the technical backwardness of the army. But in reality, the Japanese army could not reach the standard of European armaments, and its strength was greatly changed. Although Japan's population has increased, its number of trained reserve soldiers is only half that of France. In order to meet the needs of wartime, it is necessary to mobilize a large army. Japan must exhaust all the trained reserve soldiers that can be mobilized. According to the estimates of foreign experts (German and American), Japan needs to dispatch 1 million to 1.2 million personnel to the front line - to attack the Soviet Union on the Mongolian border and the coastline. At the same time, a considerable number of troops must be left in the country, and another part of the team must occupy North China and Manchuria. Therefore, it is very clear that as soon as the war starts, Japan will almost need to use all of its trained reserve soldiers. Therefore, fighting the Soviet Union will cause Japan to feel a huge threat of manpower shortage from the very beginning.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Guangdong Attempt to Invade Lubao from Sanshui. Artillery Fights Break Out Between the Two Armies in Sanshui. Fierce Battle on Luxi Highway in Lucun for Four Days.</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Guangdong Province still maintain a defensive posture in the northeast and the two rivers. The Japanese troops in the Jiangmen-Xinhui area are also only trying to hold on. Only in Sanshui and other key areas of the West River do they constantly send teams to spy. Therefore, artillery battles often break out on both sides of the West River in Sanshui. The Japanese troops use shallow-water warships to fire cannons to cover the invasion of Chinese army defense areas by speedboats. The Chinese army's mechanized units have already been deployed to the front line to prevent the Japanese troops from crossing the river. Whenever the Japanese troops approach the shore, they immediately fire cannons to inflict heavy casualties. Every time the Japanese troops try to cross the river, they suffer losses. If too many troops are used, the Japanese troops do not have the strength. If there are too few troops, it is like scratching an itch. When the Japanese troops initially occupied Sanshui, they took the opportunity to break into the lower Legang and Zaogang areas in Mafang on the north bank. Later, the Chinese army believed that the terrain was strategic and transferred some elite soldiers to cooperate with a certain special unit to counterattack, and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese troops for three days, and finally wiped out the Japanese troops in the Zaogang area. At this point, the Chinese army's front-line position on the front of the West River was as solid as a rock. The Japanese troops believed that the fortifications in the area were solid and difficult to cross, so in recent months, no Japanese cavalry have been seen near Mafang. Jinliwei, the south bank of the Xijiang River across from Sanshui, has long been coveted by the Japanese troops. Before the invasion, Japanese planes were sent to bomb Jinli, causing the destruction of three-tenths of the shops in the area. After the Japanese planes ravaged, 500 Japanese troops were sent to cross the river from Sanshui. The Chinese army in Jinli calmly waited for half of the Japanese troops to land before suddenly launching a counterattack. In this battle, almost all of the Japanese troops were wiped out. A few remnants were covered by Japanese planes and escaped on boats. At present, the Japanese troops' reliance on the strong waves of speedboats is not as urgent as it was a few months ago.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese troops in the West River changed their offensive strategy due to their lack of success. They targeted Lubao, which belongs to Sanshui, as their offensive target. Lubao is located north of Sanshui. By crossing Lubao, they can go upstream to Xujiang, raid Qingyuan, and cut off the communication line between the Chinese armies in the West River and the North River. Therefore, although Lubao belongs to the left wing of the West River, its situation is important. The Japanese troops occupied the southwest of Sanshui, and there is a highway that can lead directly to Lubao, named the Luxi Highway. Also, you can reach the Xujiang Estuary of Lubao from the waterway from Sanshui. However, there are elite Chinese troops deployed on both land and water. Recently, the Japanese troops have continuously attacked Lubao from both water and land. Once, the Japanese troops used more than a thousand infantry and cavalry, aided by the air force, and launched a fierce attack along the Luxi Highway, and occupied Lucun, a key point near the road, with great momentum. For strategic reasons, the Chinese army transferred to a new position and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese troops for four days. Villages in the northern Sanshui area were turned into war zones. Later, the Chinese army's mechanized units arrived and counterattacked in one go, and finally defeated the Japanese troops who had invaded Lucun, causing them to collapse. In this battle, the Japanese troops lost many heavy cannons and suffered more than a thousand casualties, which was the second major blow since the Japanese troops occupied Sanshui. At that time, in order to prevent Chinese army reinforcements, the Japanese troops in Lucun sent a partial division to attack Yangmei along the Jiangkou by boat. The Chinese army had expected this move from the Japanese troops and used an elite unit to fight back. As a result, the Japanese troops not only failed to cut off Chinese army reinforcements, causing Lucun to be lost and regained, but also had several speedboats sunk by the Chinese army near Yangmei, which was also something that the Japanese military authorities did not expect.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Suzhou Build Barracks. The Location is Near Guangji Bridge.</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Guangye Unit of the Japanese Army in Suzhou has now selected a 36-mu empty lot in a certain surname's ancestral hall next to the Huayuan Hotel at Guangji Bridge outside the Ge Gate, and plans to build barracks. On the morning of the 15th, they held the so-called groundbreaking ceremony. During the ceremony, two Japanese people playing the role of Shinto priests chanted Shinto mantras in Japanese, held evergreen branches with white paper attached, and spread wine and food spirits all over the ground, murmuring non-stop. Finally, Guangye and Yongjing used small hoes and small shovels to break ground. According to Guangye, wherever the Japanese army is stationed, the Japanese military has already decided that barracks must be built one after another so that the Japanese army can be permanently stationed. The Suzhou barracks are being undertaken by Japanese engineer Xiben, and are scheduled to be completed by the end of November.</p>
<h3>Four Japanese Planes Bomb Taixian, Killing and Injuring More Than Twenty Civilians. Japanese Troops in Rugao are Repelled.</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: At 2:01 pm on the 14th of this month, one Japanese fighter plane and three bomber planes suddenly flew in from the southwest of Taixian City. They dropped six bombs at the Xiaocai Square, Zhonglou Lane, and the riverside of the County Government Park outside the North Gate, killing and injuring more than 20 civilians and destroying dozens of houses. A quarter of an hour later, the Japanese planes fled to the southwest.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, 30 to 40 Japanese troops from Rugao went to Lujia Ferry to patrol. After the Chinese army opened fire to counterattack, the Japanese troops fled in panic towards Rugao City. Before long, more than 200 Japanese troops were dispatched from Rugao City in an attempt to attack the Chinese army's position. At the same time, Japanese troops opened dozens of artillery shells from the North Gate Yangqiao intersection automobile station and the Sanlimiao artillery forts outside the West Gate to demonstrate. The Chinese army calmly responded. Only one bomb landed in Balidian, killing and injuring seven or eight civilians. At about 8 o'clock, the Japanese troops retreated. At 12 o'clock in the morning, another 70 to 80 Japanese cavalrymen attacked the Chinese army's position in Qilique. Contact occurred between the two sides and stopped after about an hour. As a result, three Japanese cavalrymen were killed and two Chinese soldiers were injured. The Japanese troops retreated to Rugao City at 1:30 pm.</p>
<p>The Kunshan Puppet Government Sets Up a Puppet Public Property Office. Fang Zhongjing Serves as the Puppet Director.</p>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: Wang Youzhi, the puppet magistrate of Kunshan, spared no effort in exploitation. In addition to collecting land taxes, he also opened up new avenues, restoring the Public Property Office, and appointed Fang Zhongjing and Gu Jianxia as puppet directors and deputy directors. The number of public properties in Kunshan is very large, and the annual income is considerable. The puppet magistrate has long coveted this, but has no one familiar with the content and has no way to ask about it. Now that he has the assistance of Fang and Gu, he will restore the Public Property Office and start collecting land rent. Since Kunshan suffered from the ravages of war, the four townships have been deserted, and the crops have been abandoned in the fields. Moreover, the villages along the road have all become ruins. The farmers' homes have been destroyed, and they cannot engage in cultivation again. Therefore, last autumn, there was no harvest at all. Now, the puppet county government is using the puppet Public Property Office to collect rent from the farmers. Those who cannot pay will be arrested, and the proceeds will be pocketed. Therefore, the people are very resentful.</p>
<p>The Atmosphere of Poison in Zhenjiang is Extremely Strong. Vagrants and Local Bullies Specialize in Selling Drugs. There are More Than Ten Government-Licensed Tobacco Shops in the City.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since the provincial capital was occupied, the Japanese have successively sent a large number of vagrants and geishas, ​​ostensibly to help the puppet organization and promote local prosperity. At present, in the main streets of Zhencheng, in addition to Japanese soldiers, Japanese men and women in kimonos and wooden exhibitions can be seen everywhere. According to investigations, the number of overseas Chinese in Zhenjiang has reached two hundred and several tens. Most of them opened dental clinics, watch repair shops, and photography studios (ie photography rooms), and secretly also engaged in the sale of opium, morphine, red pills, and various drugs. The vagrants also colluded with local hooligans to open theaters and brothels, such as the Zhongshan Bridge National Cinema, the Zhenjiang Grand Theater on Zhonghua Road, and the Osaka No. 1 Building (Japanese brothel) on Zhengbei Road. They arbitrarily occupied residents' houses, or demolished the houses and rebuilt them on the land. They also forcibly seized a large number of foreign pine wood from the Zhenjiang British Merchants' Xiangtai Timber Company for use as building materials. The company sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese, but it was ineffective.</p>
<p>According to current investigations, there are fifteen government-licensed tobacco shops in Zhenbu, and there were more than fifty smoking places in front of the shops. Now, nearly a hundred have been added. Street corners are full of red characters or gold characters "×× Smoking Place" store signs. The puppet newspapers also openly publish bizarre advertisements such as "×× Smoking Place, female reception, particularly comfortable." In order to encourage people to smoke opium, the puppet government even reduced the short-term license fee for smokers, stipulating that each ticket costs five cents and can be smoked for one month.</p>
<p>The Horn Stone Opposite Shantou is Fortunately Safe and Sound. Another World in the Beacon Fire of Linghai.</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Horn Stone opposite Shantou is compared by some to Gulangyu in Xiamen, one sea mile away from Shantou. The Horn Stone Mountain is a great building of the American church with green tiles and red walls, combining Chinese and Western styles. There is a Horn Stone Boys' and Girls' High School each, each occupying a mountain peak. Between the two mountains, there is a new-style cement stone bridge to connect them, which is the only way for students of the two schools to get to class. The bridge is seventy feet long, passing through the air. Under the bridge is a mountain ditch with民居 of varying heights. Every day, the sound of bells can be heard, and residents can also look up at the lively students going to class on the bridge. To the left of the mountain are Yishi Hospital, Women's Home Economics Institute, Mingdao Women's Theological Seminary, Kindergarten Normal School, Boys' and Girls' Higher Primary School, etc. This place is the birthplace of Christianity in eastern Guangdong. The 70th Anniversary Hall of the Baptist Church is located on the hillside. The Boys' Theological School is also located here. There are about 3,000 men and women from various counties studying here. The nearby villagers are all influenced by Christianity. Every Sunday, they gather in the church. The scenery is beautiful, clean and quiet, like a paradise.</p>
<p>The Horn Stone has this special advantage. People from all countries have built houses by the sea, such as the British Consulate, the Tax Office's official residence, 洋行 residences, doctors' dormitories, and foreign领事別邸. Most of them gather here. There is a police station there to maintain law and order. Since the July 7th Incident, the Horn Stone is neither a military key point nor has any equipment. There were rumors that the consuls of various countries stationed in Shantou had negotiated with the Japanese in Hong Kong and designated the Horn Stone as a neutral zone. The civilians passed on the message, and they regarded the Horn Stone as a safe area.</p>
<p>In the past, whenever the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou was tense, the Horn Stone Mountain Village would increase its prosperity. At present, the houses in the village have been rented out. A two- or three-方丈 building on the first floor costs more than twenty yuan a month in rent, almost exceeding the rent value of Shantou City. Even the bathrooms and kitchens have been rented out. The Wu Tian Village across the mountain ridge has also prospered with the Horn Stone. The British Consulate of Horn Stone is built at the foot of the mountain, and the fence spans the sea and the mountain peak, occupying the beauty of the forest, springs, water, and rocks. The area is 40 mu. In front of the consulate, there is a stone堤 extending into the sea, and a码头 is built to connect to the 堤. On both sides of the 堤, there are places for small boats to dock. Not far from the pier, there are often one or two British warships parked to protect the British consulate and British expatriates. On the pier, you can remotely view the Shantou Customs Inspection Factory and the oil merchants' warehouses of Qi Lu on the seaside. From the Horn Stone Middle School dormitory, you can see a panoramic view of Shantou City. At present, the suburbs of Shantou City are a vast ocean. The Chaojie ferry travels into the interior at night. Foreign ships enter Mayu Port, and all of them can be seen. As for the boats on the sea, coming and going day and night, like a leaf floating in the pond, the sparkling waves are dazzling, and the pine trees are refreshing, which is a great view of the corner of Linghai.</p>
<p>The Horn Stone schools are also ordered to evacuate and move to the interior, teaching classes in shifts. Only the employees of Shantou industry and commerce are temporarily living in the Horn Stone, going out in the morning and returning in the evening. It is heard that the population of the Horn Stone is about 20,000. From the Horn Stone, you can enter Chaoyang City. You have to travel eight li to Leikou and cross the river. You can also reach Dahao, Donghu, and Gezhou. After crossing the Lian River again, it is Haimen and Magao. The above-mentioned locations are 20 Chinese miles away from the Horn Stone, but the Horn Stone is surrounded by mountain peaks, forming a separate area. It is connected to the above-mentioned locations by only a very small mountain path. Throughout history, when the coast has been attacked, the Horn Stone has not been affected due to its special environment. Japanese planes have repeatedly dropped bombs or fired on the sea. When they pass over the Horn Stone on their way out to sea, they look down and scout, but they have not unleashed their deadly forces. Therefore, the Horn Stone is fortunately safe and sound.</p>

<h3>The Perfection of Marital Life: The Engine of Increased Health and Happiness</h3>
<p>In the past, doctors were unaware of the root causes of neurasthenia and uterine diseases in women, as well as various venereal diseases in men. However, with the advancement of endocrinology of the reproductive glands, it is now deeply understood where the crux of these diseases lies.</p>
<p>A child who is castrated or has blocked vas deferens will not grow a beard, or will have very little of it, will have a high-pitched voice, and possess several personality traits different from ordinary men. Therefore, the endocrine secretions of the reproductive glands not only govern our reproductive functions, but also control our developmental functions in childhood. As for married men and women, they further govern the health and happiness of their daily lives. A pair of healthy and beautiful spouses, due to the intensity of their love, will inevitably have a fulfilling marital life. After a fulfilling marital life, part of the secretions of the reproductive glands in the body is indeed output through external ducts to mutually regulate their physical and mental well-being. At the same time, part of the secreted glands directly flows into the blood vessels, irrigating the whole body, thereby providing comfort to the mind and ease to the body, and the wings of sweet sleep will descend upon the beautiful couple. In addition, metabolism and other functions are enhanced, resulting in good digestion and smooth blood circulation. As long as they can maintain appropriate restraint and hygiene, their health will inevitably improve day by day, their love will be especially lasting, and giving birth to sons and daughters and organizing a happy family will bring such happiness! Therefore, it is said that a fulfilling marital life is the engine for increasing health and happiness, which is entirely a fact. However, the perfection of marital life must be based on health. If a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emissions in his early years, or early marriage and indulgence, consuming too much of the secretions of the reproductive glands, then symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, incomplete development, thin sperm and infertility, and neurasthenia will abound. Such a husband, even with a beautiful wife like a flower, will inevitably find himself inadequate in marital life, which is not only unpleasant and deeply painful for himself, but how can a passionate wife be content with it? Therefore, discord in the bedroom, sadness leading to illness, or even divorce and elopement can lead to various tragedies! This not only destroys happiness but also damages health. To seek remedies, according to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, taking "Reproductive Gland Extract" preparations made from the reproductive glands of strong male animals is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. Indeed, after taking this preparation, it can generate sperm and tonify the kidneys, invigorate the brain and activate the blood, nourish the nerves within one day and night. It adjusts metabolic functions and promotes developmental functions. After taking it for a week, the above-mentioned symptoms will be cured in mild cases and alleviated in severe cases. If you continue to take it for more than a month, all symptoms will disappear and your body will become healthier. The famous German doctor Tameillsam, compared this preparation with other similar preparations. The results were that the quality of "Reproductive Gland Extract" is excellent, and its effectiveness is five to fifteen times greater than other similar preparations. It is also rich in positive and constructive tonic power. Regular use by the elderly and middle-aged can achieve the effect of rejuvenation. As for other similar preparations, they often have side effects of stimulating the nerves and stomach, and prolonged use is not advisable. If there is nocturnal emission, also take "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" (available at major Chinese and Western pharmacies in Wuzhou) to control leakage and achieve faster results.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission Can Cause Premature Aging in Young People</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Aging is an inevitable stage of life. Aging due to increasing age is natural; however, there are also people who, due to careful maintenance, do not show signs of aging despite their increasing age. These people are truly blessed. If someone is already showing signs of aging at a young age, or even shortening their lifespan, according to hygiene experts, this is their own fault! Originally, nature endowed them with aging at sixty and dying at eighty, but now they are aging at thirty and dying before their natural lifespan, is this not the utmost sin!</p>
<p>What causes people to age? The most common cause is the loss of reproductive glands, and the rate of aging is also the fastest. Young people who do not cherish themselves may commit masturbation during the period of spring arousal, and then suffer from nocturnal emissions due to masturbation or early marriage and indulgence. If nocturnal emission is neglected and left untreated, resulting in excessive consumption of reproductive gland fluids in the body, symptoms such as brain decay and forgetfulness, insomnia and excessive dreams, back pain, kidney deficiency and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and neurasthenia are inevitable. As a result, the face becomes sallow, muscles wither, the body and spirit are depleted, and although young in age, the appearance of old age is fully revealed, and even alas, they become short-lived ghosts!</p>
<p>A German medical scientist said: Nocturnal emission is a leaking source of our life force, and we must be alarmed and seek early treatment. According to the medical records of thousands of patients by world-renowned doctors and my own experience, the most effective treatment is taking "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidation Tablets." This medicine can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and allow for restful sleep, reduce dreams, and stop nocturnal emissions on the same night. If the above-mentioned symptoms have already been caused by nocturnal emissions, it is necessary to also take the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductive Gland Extract" to nourish the brain and kidneys, sperm and blood, and nerves. After continuing to take it for half a month, you will surely be able to restore perfect health and prolong life. If patients can come to my clinic for electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Breasts in Beauty, Health, and Happiness</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>No matter what you do, if you don't think about it from the root, you will eventually fail. Now, let's take the example of women's pursuit of beauty. Many women do not think about their own health, but only focus on decoration. What's the use of that? For example, a very young girl, because she is sick and in pain, loses her health, and loses the most valuable characteristic beauty of women - shriveled breasts, thin hips, and withered muscles - then even if she wears the most fashionable clothes, what moving curves can she have? Not only that, but because the clothes are too thin, the whole body outline looks even more ugly and contemptible! Therefore, when entering social occasions, she is often scorned by modern men, or given a cold laugh. Even taking a step back, in the private life between husband and wife, when the sweltering summer night comes and the "unveiling" show begins, this kind of strange shape with flat breasts, as soon as it enters the man's eyes, will undoubtedly drop the 120% enthusiasm from boiling point to freezing point, resulting in unhappiness, disgust in the heart, and creating various evils in the future. Isn't this a very common thing?</p>
<p>Based on the above, it can be seen that breasts are of great importance to women's beauty, health, and happiness. If unfortunately shriveled, one should seek to remedy it as soon as possible, and according to the results of experiments by famous Chinese and Western gynecologists, the most reliable method of remedy is universally recognized to be taking the ovary preparation "Reproductive Gland Extract" for women, which is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. The ingredients of this preparation are extracted from the ovarian essence of extremely strong animals and prepared by scientific methods, so the medicine is peaceful and has great effects. If you continue to take it, not only can it make the shriveled breasts gradually rise, the thin hips gradually become plump, but also adjust menstruation, eliminate all uterine disorders, invigorate metabolism, make the cheeks more radiant, enhance love between husband and wife, and prolong youth.</p>

<h3>Special Treatment for Gonorrhea with Redness, Swelling, and Pain</h3>
<p>During the acute stage of gonorrhea, the glans and foreskin become inflamed and painful due to the irritation of the gonococcal toxin, which is a common symptom during the acute stage. The area around the patient's urethral opening will inevitably be red, swollen, and painful. The severity of these symptoms is always related to the intensity of the gonococcus. If the toxicity is strong, the lower part of the urethral opening, the two sides of the frenulum of the penis, and even the entire foreskin will be edematous and shiny. The swelling is accompanied by pain, but the fluid accumulated in this swelling is similar to hydrocele and is not pus. Since the condition has reached this point, the invasion of the bacteria has spread to the paraurethral glands, Littre's glands, and follicles. If these areas are indeed invaded by toxins, small to pea-sized swellings and indurations will occur in these areas, which can be detected by palpation. As a result, the urethral cavity is obstructed by these indurations and narrowed, making urination even more difficult.</p>
<p>To detect this condition, a new-style urethroscope should be used for a detailed examination to understand the true nature of the disease. Then, German lymphotropic electrotherapy is used to directly irradiate the gonococci in the lesion. Gonococci in the paraurethral glands cannot be eradicated by local surgery. Only lymphotropic electrotherapy can penetrate deep into the lesion. On the one hand, chemical therapy and specially made autologous vaccines are used as injections. In this way, all inflammatory and swelling symptoms will completely subside within one week, and the urethral indurations can also be eliminated and restored to their original state in two weeks. This treatment is the crystallization of my experience over the past ten years.</p>

<h3>Japanese Illegally Seize Over 200 Million Yuan in Customs Revenue</h3>
<p>— By John Ahlers, Translated by Bo Ming for the Miller's Review</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities have been unilaterally implementing the current customs tariff rates in the occupied areas of China for a year now, as of June 1st of this year. On May 31st of last year, the internationally recognized 1934 Chinese customs tariff rates ceased to apply to the parts of China controlled by the Japanese army. The next day, the current tariff rates were implemented in ports north of Hangzhou Bay and in Xiamen. This Japanese-made tariff rate was subsequently extended to Guangzhou. This year, it was also implemented on Hainan Island and in other small ports in the Jiangmen and Humen areas of South China. Although Japan formulated and implemented this tariff rate, other foreign countries have tacitly acquiesced to its implementation. However, from the perspective of ineffective international law, this tariff rate remains illegal. Japan is acting in the name of the puppet regimes established by the Japanese army in China. These regimes do not possess the characteristics of normal governments and have not been recognized by any country, not even by Japan. The puppet tariff rate is merely a solo act supported by Japanese bayonets. Foreigners pay this tax not because they recognize it, but because they have no other choice. The 1938 tariff rate, as expected, greatly benefited the Japanese in China. With the assistance of the Japanese army, Japan used this tariff rate to gain the vast majority of foreign trade in the occupied areas. Before the war, Japan accounted for only about 12% of China's import trade. Currently, it accounts for more than 40% in all of China, about half in the Japanese-occupied areas along the Yangtze River (excluding the entire batch of smuggled goods), and about 70% in North China. This was recently stated by Japanese Finance Minister Ishiwata. A year ago, the Japanese claimed that their 1938 tariff rates were merely intended to restore the old 1931 Chinese tariff rate levels. However, they had to admit that the 1938 tariff rates implemented many exceptions that differed from the 1931 tariff rates. Most of these exceptions were applied to export goods that were particularly advantageous to Japan. The Japanese also asserted that this tariff rate equally considered the interests of all foreign countries. Today, foreign trade statistics books of the customs office prove that for most goods to which exceptions are applied, Japan either monopolizes their import or accounts for the vast majority of their import. Furthermore, the 1938 tariff rate effectively provided the puppet regime in Peiping under Japanese protection with weapons, which the puppet regime fully used to compete with the commercial interests of Europe and the United States in China. The Japanese seized the right to set tariff rates that legally belonged to the Chinese government and used this power to adopt numerous methods of controlling imports in North China. As a result, on March 11, 1933, export control conditions were promulgated, and Yokohama Specie Bank gained the greatest benefit from the new customs tariff rate. This benefit was the ability to control China's customs, use its income to invade China. Since Japan controls the coastal provinces, it is natural that most of China's foreign trade continues to be transacted in the Japanese-occupied areas. A large part of China's customs revenue is generated as a result. From June 1st of last year to May 31st of this year, 70-80% of China's customs revenue was generated in ports under Japanese control. The revenue for this entire year has been deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. The Chinese customs revenue currently held by this bank totals approximately 200 million yuan, half of which was generated in Shanghai alone. Japan still insists that it is not at war with China, while controlling China's most important source of income, which is certainly a most rare spectacle. It is also a rare spectacle that Japan does not hand over this revenue to the various puppet regimes that it claims are the legitimate government of China. But there is even more to be amazed at. Japan, which has no right to this revenue, brazenly occupies it by force and refuses to repay the bonds of Chinese foreign debts secured by customs duties, which are legally held by third countries. The number of these bonds is quite large, reaching more than 20 million pounds. Recently, it has been necessary to suspend the payment of their principal and interest, all of which is a direct result of Japan's seizure and use of Chinese customs duties. The use of Chinese customs duties to repay Chinese foreign debts secured by them enjoys a legally prior claim to other demands. Previously, these debts required an annual payment of 95 million to 100 million yuan. Since Japan controls about 70-80% of China's total customs revenue, it should repay 70-80% of the maturing foreign debt. To date, the customs revenue seized by Japan is double the debt, but the Yokohama Specie Bank has not allocated a single penny to repay Chinese foreign debts secured by customs duties. If the maturing debt were entirely reliant on Japan, it would have been suspended since June 1st a year ago. In order to maintain its own international credit, the Chinese government, although only receiving 20% of China's customs revenue, still fully allocated the funds needed to repay the maturing foreign debt secured in the past for nine months, only until February of this year, when Chongqing announced that it could no longer continue to strictly fulfill all of China's financial debts. In the past three months, the Chinese government has repaid the maturing debt in proportion to the actual customs revenue received. Even at that time, Japan still did not repay its 70-80% share, so a portion of the debt was suspended. If the debt secured by Chinese customs duties were only reliant on Japan, the debt would have been suspended long ago. Moreover, it is reported that the Japanese authorities have added many Japanese employees to the customs office, especially low-level employees. On the other hand, the customs offices in these ports have been forced to reduce their own salaries and expenses before handing over the remaining funds to the Yokohama Specie Bank. In some places, customs revenue is not sufficient to cover expenses and salaries, resulting in customs employees being owed salaries for a long time. Xiamen is one such place. The 200 million yuan in customs revenue deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank belongs partly to foreign holders of Chinese customs bonds and partly to the central government in Chongqing, but the Japanese handle these funds as if they belonged to the Tokyo treasury. The Japanese pretend that this money is kept in special accounts, managed and not used. In light of the unreliability of other Japanese guarantees, what the Japanese say raises questions. The Japanese have no precise accounts for these funds, and the Yokohama Specie Bank refuses to disclose its accounts and allow representatives of those who hold bonds for Chinese customs revenue to review where and how those funds are being managed. These two points clearly indicate that the Japanese have reasons to conceal the truth about these funds. In fact, Japan has never left this customs money untouched and uses it in various ways, the purpose of which is completely contrary to the legal nature and intended purpose of the funds. Most of the customs deposits in the Yokohama Specie Bank appear to have been partially lent out and partially spent. Japan uses Chinese customs funds for its own political, economic and military purposes through three channels: (1) The Yokohama Specie Bank has provided large loans to the puppet governments in Peiping and Nanking, with Chinese customs funds as "collateral." The funds that belong to the foreign bondholders and the Chinese government have thus been indirectly transferred to the irresponsible political puppets of the Japanese army. The Yokohama Specie Bank has profited handsomely from excessive interest rates, thereby repeating the famous Nishihara Loans transaction of 1918-19, except that the funds being lost are Chinese funds rather than Japanese ones. (2) The Yokohama Specie Bank uses Chinese customs funds to buy foreign exchange on the open market in Shanghai, thereby purchasing military supplies overseas to supply the Japanese army in China. This purchase of foreign exchange puts heavy pressure on the Shanghai currency market and thus helps Japan's policy of undermining the Chinese legal tender and extracting China's exchange reserves. (3) It is heard that the Japanese have seized Chinese customs revenue and directly used it to pay for their military expenses in China. There have been several examples of this. Japanese military and political spokesmen naturally deny this and call it a fabrication, but they should open the books of the Yokohama Specie Bank for the representatives of foreign bondholders with foreign debts secured by Chinese customs duties to thoroughly examine. However, the Japanese army will never allow this to happen. For this reason, the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement of May 1938 may have become one of the worst diplomatic blunders Britain has made in the Far East. Other powers who agreed to it, whether on the surface or otherwise, cannot escape blame. In the mid-19th century, when bandits rebelled, foreigners first acted as "custodians" of Chinese customs revenue. After 1900, when the Boxer Indemnity was implemented, the powers actually controlled China's customs revenue, with Britain in the leading position. However, the powers did not "abuse" China's revenue. After repaying the principal and interest of the debt at the old ad valorem 5% tariff rate, the remaining revenue was handed over to the Chinese government for its own use. After the Chinese government gained tariff autonomy in 1917, the government itself was responsible for repaying the principal and interest of the debt secured by customs duties and faithfully adhered to these debts. Today, it is for the first time in Chinese history that China has been forced to suspend its foreign debt secured by customs duties not due to its own fault. The agreement negotiated in Tokyo by Mr. Patzer, the economic adviser to the British Embassy in the Far East, paved the way for the implementation of the current tariff rate in the Japanese-occupied areas and the "custody" of Chinese customs funds by the Japanese. This agreement has not yet been fulfilled, but the Japanese have obtained all the benefits stipulated in the agreement to be given to them and have abandoned all their obligations. The British authorities agreed to Japan's control of customs revenue for two purposes: (1) to hope to maintain the integrity of the customs office established by the British and staffed largely by foreign personnel, so as not to cause division, and (2) the British authorities hoped to protect the interests of foreign bondholders, most of whom were British. Britain undoubtedly believed that taking measures with the Japanese could guarantee the integrity of the customs office. Other powers that advised their nationals to pay the tariff rate implemented by the Japanese undoubtedly had the same intention. The Japanese officials who negotiated with Mr. Patzer may have had similar ideas, but the inevitable has happened. The Japanese, under the pressure of their military, not only seized the revenue belonging to the recognized Chinese government and diverted it for their own selfish purposes, but also suspended the payment of maturing debt, thereby undermining treaties and international good faith. The authorities clearly did not realize in time that the negotiation of this agreement was a victory for the Japanese, who were able to use it to demand foreign consent to seize China's public revenue for private use. The Japanese portion of the Boxer Indemnity, totaling 300,000 pounds, had long been expected to be refused payment by China in the event of war between China and Japan and is now in a suspended fund at HSBC. On the one hand, China's refusal to agree to the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement was also expected. For these two reasons, we assume that the reason why the Japanese agreed to conclude the agreement and did not brazenly seize Chinese customs revenue, as threatened by their military authorities, was actually to use China's refusal to pay the indemnity as an excuse to justify their failure to fulfill the entire agreement. Thus, their act of brazenly seizing and illegally using Chinese customs revenue is no different from obtaining some kind of permission from foreign countries. This assumption seems logical.</p>
<h3>A Retrospective and Prospective View of the Sino-Japanese Currency War (Continued)</h3>
<p>— An Shi</p>
<p>2. The Currency War in North China and the Defeat of the Federated Reserve Bank of China Notes</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese currency war began in North China. Japanese economists were initially very optimistic about the currency war in North China. According to them, North China was within Japan's sphere of influence. At that time, the total amount of legal tender issued was about 140 million yuan, of which only more than 20 million yuan was circulating in North China. In addition, although there were banknotes from local and private banks, the number was small, only about 60 million yuan. There were very few legal tenders from the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank in North China, and most were from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, so it was easier to deal with. Moreover, the cash reserves of these legal tenders circulating in North China were actually kept at the Tianjin branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, rather than directly in the hands of the National Government. Therefore, the legal tenders in North China could generally be regarded as local currencies based on the economy of North China. If Japan wanted to issue new currency in North China, it only needed to expel the legal tenders from North China and separate the currency system of North China from the legal tenders. There was no need to eradicate the legal tenders completely. Thus, the Federated Reserve Bank of China notes were produced by them. However, no matter what oppressive means they used, the results of the Federated Reserve Bank of China notes were far from their expectations. In particular, the Federated Reserve Bank of China notes once fell to only 70% of the value of the legal tenders, and Japan was defeated in North China as soon as the Sino-Japanese currency war began.</p>
<p>This may have been an accident for them, but in our view, it was expected, because they underestimated the currency system in North China, just as they underestimated the economic power of the entire China before the war.</p>
<p>First, they thought that the circulation of legal tenders in North China was small, so it was easy to deal with. However, they did not know that the amount of legal tenders in circulation was determined by demand. The small amount of legal tenders in circulation in North China was entirely due to the economic situation and needs of North China, and not because the legal tenders did not have a solid foundation and influence in North China, as can be seen from the small amount of miscellaneous banknotes circulating in local private banks.</p>
<p>Secondly, the small amount exactly showed the prudence of the issuer, which in turn was enough to increase people's faith in the legal tenders. If the legal tenders had been over-issued and circulated in large quantities in North China at that time, it might have been very easy for Japan to overthrow them.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the legal tenders, no matter how the Japanese claimed, could still be used to buy foreign exchange, while the counterfeit banknotes and the associated Japanese banknotes could not. Therefore, it was simply a dream to try to drive out good money with bad money.</p>
<p>As for treating North China as a special area and separating it from the central government, this was a specialty of Japanese scholars, and we really have no need to argue against it. In addition, they made a big mistake, which was not (actually could not) consider the malignant inflation in their own country and linked the counterfeit banknotes to the Japanese yen. Before long, the failure of the counterfeit banknotes caused the Japanese banknotes to suffer a great disadvantage. In short, Japan was always defeated in the currency war in North China. To this day, the black market price of legal tenders in North China is far above that of counterfeit banknotes.</p>
<p>3. The Initial Currency War in Central China and Japan's Gradual Retreat</p>
<p>In the Sino-Japanese currency war, Japan was unsuccessful in North China and suffered a setback, so it had to be extra cautious in Central China.</p>
<p>In their eyes, Central China was the base of the National Government, its economic foundation was extremely solid, and its legal tender system was very strong. In addition, international interests were extremely complicated. Before the war, the circulation of legal tenders in Central China was about more than 100 million yuan. It was easy to talk about defeating the legal tenders in Central China. Therefore, opinions among Japanese scholars and politicians were divided on the currency war in Central China. However, in the initial stage, their claims and policies could be roughly divided into three stages:</p>
<p>(1) The Legal Tender Support Period</p>
<p>Shanghai and Nanjing fell one after another, and the Sino-Japanese currency war in Central China began. However, at that time, Japan was fully expecting "China" to surrender at its beck and call, and it was very difficult to defeat the legal tenders. Moreover, the legal tenders were good money that could be used to buy foreign exchange. Therefore, most Japanese scholars advocated (legal tender support theory) that in order to stabilize the financial world in Central China and consolidate the foundation of the puppet regime, nothing was better than actively supporting the legal tenders. If the legal tenders collapsed, the national economic strength of Central China would be destroyed accordingly. Not only would the puppet regime be hit, but the Japanese economy would also be adversely affected. Not only that, if the legal tenders were suppressed and their value plummeted, the result would inevitably be resentment from third countries, which would hinder the "construction of the New Order in East Asia."</p>
<p>This argument is really pitiful! We do not need to criticize whether the theory is right or wrong, because this is tantamount to Japan surrendering to the legal tenders without a fight. However, we must know that at the beginning of the war, the efforts of this faction were the strongest and were reflected in Japan's currency policy towards China: In the eyes of ordinary people, this seems a little unexpected, but in the eyes of people with a little economic knowledge, it is very ordinary and inevitable, because this pitiful cry is a reflection of the fragile and insecure economic foundation of Japan. In this way, in the first sound of the currency war in Central China, Japan unconditionally surrendered to the legal tenders!</p>
<p>(2) The Legal Tender Laissez-Faire Period</p>
<p>Japanese scholars had to advocate the "legal tender support theory" because they knew the fragility of their economic foundation, but this was a great contradiction. Because Japan was fighting with the National Government and was instead supporting the legal tenders it issued, making its economy more consolidated and helping its long-term resistance to succeed: This was really a farce. Therefore, before long, Japanese scholars retreated from the "legal tender support theory" to the "legal tender laissez-faire theory." Their claim was that the legal tenders should not be supported, but there was no need to destroy them. They should be allowed to take their natural course, and as a result, they would collapse and disappear due to the failure of the National Government's resistance.</p>
<p>This claim was very popular for a while. But in fact, it was no different from the previous one, but only fifty steps versus a hundred steps. Because no matter whether you support it or let it go, the legal tenders are ultimately good money with consolidated credit and can be used to buy foreign exchange, and will never collapse as the Japanese dream. Moreover, allowing legal tenders to circulate in the "occupied areas" is not helping the National Government to maintain the legal tenders? It is a credit to the Japanese that they can put on this half-sad and half-happy farce. But knowing that the economic foundation is fragile and the legal tender credit is solid, what can be done?</p>
<p>(3) The Legal Tender Utilization Period</p>
<p>The Japanese realized that it was not good to support the legal tenders, and it was not good to let them go. So, in the absence of a way, they came up with a way: the "legal tender utilization theory." The claim of this faction was that in the past, Japan had pulled "Manchukuo" and North China into the yen group, so Japan's exports to these places were not much different from domestic trade, and the trade that was obtained was adversely affected, because the exports to these places were not much different from domestic trade, and there was no benefit at all in obtaining foreign goods. In other words, Japan's export trade to "Manchukuo" and North China was of no help to improving Japan's international lending and borrowing. Therefore, this time, Central China should be excluded from the yen group, and the legal tenders should be used as currency, so that Japan's exports could obtain legal tenders through this route, and then use the legal tenders to hedge foreign exchange.</p>
<p>This faction's theory also had its merits, and Japan also adopted it as a policy. But it soon failed, because they did not think about the special situation of the yen in Central China. Because the over-issuance of yen and military notes in Central China had caused its controlled price of one shilling and two pence of Japanese yarn to fall to the same value as the black market price of eight pence of legal tenders, and sometimes even lower. No matter who it was, they wanted to get rid of this yen and military notes that could not be used to obtain foreign exchange as soon as possible. Therefore, Japan's trade with China in Central China was in fact mostly settled in yen, and the legal tender utilization theory also fell through. Not only that, in theory, using legal tenders to hedge foreign exchange has both destructive power on the one hand, and can also raise the value and status of legal tenders on the other hand.</p>
<p>In short, in the currency war in Central China, Japan had to admit the stability and value of the legal tenders from beginning to end, so in the currency war, it gradually retreated and unconditionally surrendered to the legal tenders. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Problem of Capital Dispersion Amidst Rising Prices</h3>
<p>— Wu Zejin</p>
<p>The escalating prices in Shanghai have become the most serious phenomenon here. This publication previously urged scholars and experts to discuss and study the causes and stabilization methods in detail. Many gentlemen have expressed grand theories and insightful opinions, but few seem to offer concrete and practical suggestions and methods.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the high prices in Shanghai are caused by various factors, such as reduced production, decreased supply, concentrated population, and the establishment of the black market for foreign exchange. However, apart from these reasons, the significant expansion of currency circulation in Shanghai is undoubtedly one of the main reasons for the high prices. At the previous symposium, some gentlemen, especially Mr. Nie Guangdi, said, "The circulating capital in Shanghai after the war is not only less than before the war, but also seems tighter." This may refer to the situation shortly after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident. However, since the National Army's westward retreat, wealthy individuals from various places have concentrated in Shanghai, bringing large amounts of capital. The rapid increase in bank deposits after the war and the current atmosphere of prosperity and speculation in the market are clear evidence. Because the capital is concentrated in one place, it has created the current special prosperity, which has also led to the current high prices. Therefore, to stabilize prices, in addition to studying and addressing the other reasons mentioned above, efforts should be focused on how to appropriately disperse the surplus capital concentrated in Shanghai. As for the methods of dispersion, I see two points:</p>
<p>1.  The government should issue a type of short-term financial treasury bond designed to regulate Shanghai's capital, authorizing the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank to promote it. These four banks should use these treasury bonds to absorb general floating capital as much as possible, beyond the circulating capital actually needed in Shanghai. This method is not new. In 1934, Britain also used this method to solve its financial surplus panic at the time. However, in present-day Shanghai, this method faces difficulties. First, Shanghai is an occupied area, although there are concessions. It remains questionable whether the environment allows for the public promotion of government bonds. Second, the promotion of large-scale bonds can easily cause misunderstandings among the people and create doubt about the legal tender.</p>
<p>2.  Various banks should organize a large-scale syndicate to encourage and absorb the capital of wealthy individuals for planned internal relocation. The banks should provide guarantees with appropriate terms and interest rates for this capital, while the government should guarantee the banks' profits. This method can arouse the interest of general asset holders in investing in the interior. In the past, the main reason why their capital remained in Shanghai instead of moving inland was their unfamiliarity and uncertainty about the interior. Now that the banks guarantee profits, they will surely be happy to provide assistance. At the same time, the government's guarantee to the banks is also beneficial and harmless.</p>
<p>In addition, measures such as raising interbank deposit rates by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank to absorb idle capital from other banks, raising term deposit rates by various banks to reduce liquid current deposits, and refusing to lend funds to general speculators and hoarders are also ways to reduce floating capital and stabilize prices.</p>
<p>The above points are merely my personal views and cannot be considered suggestions. I hope those who pay attention to Shanghai's capital will conduct another detailed discussion and study. These are just for reference.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>### The Food Market: Rice Speculation Heats Up; High-Quality White Japonica Rice Reaches $21.50</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the highest price for Japonica rice in Shanghai even reached $22. According to rice merchants, the reason is that sources from various gangs, due to the closure of most areas in the interior by a certain party, and the absence of river cargo for a long time, and the recent news that Suzhou and other gangs are not sending goods, with only about a thousand packages from Changzhou and other places. At the same time, the extremely dry weather has greatly affected cultivation, leading to speculation by unscrupulous merchants. Whether retailers or hoarders, they are purchasing aggressively regardless of the high price. Storefronts are crowded with customers buying rice due to skyrocketing prices. To cope with the situation, stores are also trying their best to purchase supplies. Coinciding with Sunday, banks and warehouses were unable to release samples, resulting in a temporary shortage of supply in the market, pushing prices higher and higher. The price of Japonica rice, regardless of quality, increased by $1 to $1.23 compared to the previous market. The price of Changgao rice even reached $21.50, which was unexpected. Du Yangjian rice and Bopu rice followed closely, increasing by $0.60 to $1. Similarly, the price of silver dollars remained stagnant, with only a slight improvement of $0.20 to $0.30.</p>
<h3>### Finance: Gold Is Expensive; Silver Is Also Expensive; $2.85, Still Unwilling to Sell</h3>
<p>The spot market for gold yesterday was inactive due to the Sunday holiday, with no official prices. However, the off-market situation was largely cautious due to rumors that HSBC would stop supplying gold, which needed to be confirmed today. However, sentiment remained very firm. It was rumored that buyers who wanted to acquire gold had to offer up to $2,700 outside the customs (compared to the closing price of $2,680 the previous night). Jewelers were still exchanging gold ornaments at the Datong Bank at $270 per tael for sales and $262 for purchases. Also, a London cable on the 17th reported that the price of pure English gold had fallen by half a penny per ounce, totaling £7, 8 shillings, and 6 pence.</p>
<p>Silver has also risen following the surge in gold prices. Yesterday, buyers offered $2.85 (per tael), but sellers were still unwilling to supply. However, Datong Bank's exchange rate for standard silver remained at $2.50. It is rumored that the discount on silverware has been raised by 10% to 20% to compensate.</p>
<p>A London cable on the 17th reported that silver market speculators were selling and guessing at buying, with the market flat. The near-term price of large silver bars continued to decline by 0.0625, while the far-term price remained unchanged. A New York silver cable reported that the spot price of American silver remained unchanged. A Bombay silver cable reported that the Indian silver market was weak, with the near-term price continuing to decline by 5 annas.</p>
<h3>### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Resume Their Upward Trend</h3>
<p>According to a London cable, the sugar market recently saw a slight increase of half a penny, with August prices at 6 shillings, 11 pence, and 0.25. The far-term price remained unchanged. The municipal association's planning board indicated a continued upward trend in the market. Spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar were $29.60 at the local warehouse and $29.40 at the foreign warehouse, both up by $0.40. Re-exported customs warehouse goods were traded at prices ranging from $21.20 to $21.60, with initial prices at $21.20 for 100 bags, then $21.30 for 200 bags, and finally $21.35 for 200 bags, with land cargo at $21.60, totaling 500 bags. Taikoo Car White rose by approximately $0.20, with eastern warehouse goods priced at $28.85 for 100 bags, $28.90 for 200 bags, and $28.925 for 50 bags, western warehouse goods at $29.10 for 100 bags, CW mark at $28.80, CX at $28.50, DY mark at $27.70, and HX mark at $27.50. Local cotton white sugar Zhen Ji No. 1 returned to $29, and the situation for national sugar became increasingly tight, with pure cotton red rising to $17, with 130 bags traded. 201 bags of ice flower green sugar from Hong Kong were offered at $16.70. 110 bags of soft and inferior quality green sugar from Nanjiang were also offered at $14.50. Over 200 bags of miscellaneous foreign sugar were offered at $17.30.</p>
<h3>### Hardware: Black Iron Sheet Prices Are Strong, Sales Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>The market for black iron sheets has been sluggish recently, with stagnant sales in various sectors. For example, local thermos bottle factories have experienced sluggish sales of their thermos bottles due to high prices, resulting in weak demand for black iron sheets. Other business sectors have also shown little interest in these goods. However, due to foreign exchange rates, prices have increased by $7 to $8 compared to previous levels, with 26-inch sheets selling for $28 per picul and 36-inch sheets selling for $32 per picul, all produced by Derby.</p>
<h3>The Transition of the Exchange Rate Stabilization Fund (Continued from the 17th)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Mujie</p>
<p>In summary, direct or indirect purchases of foreign exchange in Shanghai by the Japanese is indeed a major pressure on Shanghai's foreign exchange market. According to estimates from Shanghai banking circles, nearly 4 million pounds of the stabilization fund have been used in Shanghai, of which 2.5 million pounds have been seized by the Japanese through financial or trade methods. (Note) This estimate cannot be taken as completely reliable, but maintaining the value of the legal tender on the Shanghai black market has actually become a method of attacking the legal tender.</p>
<p>(4) New Levels and Speculation on Restrictions on Sales</p>
<p>Therefore, the Stabilization Fund's temporary suspension of supplying foreign exchange, allowing the legal tender to naturally move to a lower level, is indeed a necessary measure. A Reuters cable on the 8th explained the reasons for the Anglo-Chinese Stabilization Fund's not assisting the legal tender: "The fund temporarily suspended assistance on the 7th to allow the exchange rate of the legal tender to better match the economic price and promote trade balance... A similar step was taken in June 1938, and the exchange rate was satisfactorily maintained at a price of 8 pence for 12 months. It is now believed that a new price has been obtained and can be strongly maintained." The question now is, what is the new level? How will restrictions be implemented in the future?</p>
<p>Based on market prices and the exchange rate quoted by HSBC, in my personal opinion, 6.5 pence for the pound and $16.625 for the US dollar are likely to be the new levels for the exchange rate of the legal tender. First, let's look at the closing prices in the market:</p>
<p>After the 8th, the market price stabilized. Let's also look at HSBC's quotation:</p>
<p>Also, after the 8th, it stabilized with slight movements. If the market sentiment were truly bad, it would not have stopped above 6.5 pence. At the same time, if the Stabilization Fund did not believe that this price had reached a better economic price, HSBC's quotation would not have stopped moving. Based on past experience, last year, the black market exchange rate fell from 14.25 pence to 8 pence, a depreciation of about 40%. Now, it has fallen from 8.25 to 6.5 pence, a depreciation of about 20%, for a total depreciation of about 60%, which is a very low level. Any lower would affect British and American trade with China, something the Stabilization Fund Committee is likely already aware of.</p>
<p>Secondly, regardless of the new level, if anyone applying for foreign exchange with one legal tender were given 6.5 pence, it would improve the trade deficit to some extent, but it would still be impossible to prevent Japanese arbitrage. Therefore, no matter how low the exchange rate of the legal tender is, or how cheap counterfeit currency is compared to the legal tender, the Japanese can always obtain valuable foreign exchange with worthless paper money. Therefore, once a new level is obtained, a new supply method must be implemented immediately. According to reports, after HSBC restricted the supply of foreign exchange to the black market, it continued to supply those with legitimate needs based on order forms. This restriction method is still inadequate. The new supply method should be based on the principle of meeting the most urgent needs without being indirectly exploited by the Japanese. Otherwise, even if one legal tender is worth one penny, the Japanese will still arbitrage. —June 10th—</p>

<h3>Male Infertility: Remedying It with Scientific Methods</h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>For Eastern peoples who have historically practiced a clan system, the primary purpose of marriage is to have children. If no children are born, divorce and other situations may arise. However, according to current medical research, the cause of infertility is not solely with the woman. Diseases such as gonorrhea and impotence in men can also impair reproductive function. Gonorrhea can cause inflammation of the testicles and epididymis on both sides, leading to a lack of sperm and preventing conception. Sometimes, even if gonorrhea is treated vigorously, it reduces the function of the youth glands that govern desire, leading to premature kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>Kidney deficiency is common in the elderly due to physiological reasons, resulting from a decrease in the excitability of the erection center. In young people, apart from excessive sexual activity and harmful masturbation leading to kidney deficiency, the main cause is early licentiousness and drug use.</p>
<p>After suffering from kidney deficiency, men often exhibit a state of mental unease, such as headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, back pain, and chest tightness. They often experience nocturnal emissions. There are also pathological manifestations in sexual activity, such as premature ejaculation and impotence, which ultimately constitute the main cause of infertility after marriage.</p>
<p>Our purpose in procreating offspring is to maintain the love between husband and wife, preserve family harmony, and enjoy family happiness. To achieve this, it is essential to enhance sexual function. If one suffers from the above-mentioned conditions (with irregular menstruation being the most common disease causing infertility in women), the feelings between husband and wife will ultimately not be able to blend harmoniously. However, the treatment of these diseases must be remedied with the latest scientific methods. Now that the damage to the youth glands from these conditions has been understood, the best treatment is to take "Vitaton," a male-specific preparation made from German testicular extract. "Vitaton" was invented by the German physiologist Dr. Müllen. Its ingredients are extracted from the testicles and ovaries of animals. It has remarkable effects on those suffering from premature aging, kidney deficiency, sexual dysfunction, and weak erectile power. It can nourish the brain, kidneys, and blood. Elderly people who take it can rejuvenate. The female version functions to regulate menstruation and promote conception, and it is suitable for all uterine diseases. It is trusted by doctors both in China and abroad and can be said to be an effective remedy for kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>Gonococci Are Approaching Their End</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Gonococci, which have been rampant for thousands of years, are now approaching their final end. This amazing new medical record should be entirely attributed to the German gonococcal master, Dr. Peter. Before Dr. Peter invented the effective gonorrhea drug "Sterinol," only chemotherapy and percutaneous sterilization therapy dominated the treatment field. However, we clinicians inevitably experience disappointment with these two therapies from time to time. Because chemotherapy has powerful side effects, although it has a temporary sterilizing effect, the gains do not outweigh the losses. Moreover, there are often unpleasant prognoses after taking it. As for percutaneous sterilization, as the name suggests, it only has a slight sterilizing effect on the mucous membrane. However, due to the fierce nature of gonococci, this weak sterilizing effect is like a drop in the bucket and offers no fundamental solution. Therefore, we clinicians often feel it is difficult to handle.</p>
<p>However, after the worst, there is finally the discovery of the drug "Clinon." After taking this drug, all cells in the body develop an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect within a few palmfuls. Therefore, wherever gonococci hide, the sterilizing effect of "Clinon" is also generated. Based on this principle, regardless of where gonococci are distributed in gonorrhea patients, they can be eradicated by this great sterilizing effect. For all gonococcal prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, cystitis, arthritis, and other symptoms, after taking "Clinon," the blood is examined daily with a microscope, and the gonococci invariably decrease day by day, while the phagocytic function of white blood cells increases. Thus, both new and old gonorrhea are completely cured in a short period. As for external medicine, men can simultaneously use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally. Women with gonococcal leukorrhea can use "Carle Sedty Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, following the instructions or diagrams for secret self-treatment at home, which is especially effective.</p>
<h3>Early Summer Therapy for Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>The weather in early summer is suddenly cold and suddenly hot. If one is not careful, the patient's body is easily affected, leading to the deterioration of lung disease. It can also cause complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and acute catarrh of the intestines. To prevent this, patients must be as careful as they are in the autumn, paying attention to changes in the weather at all times and preparing clothing. In particular, drug therapy should not be neglected. In addition to paying attention to health preservation at all times, lung disease patients should take the German lung disease-specific medicine "Pulmonal" daily to enhance their constitution and strengthen their resistance. "Pulmonal" functions to eliminate phlegm and relieve coughs. It can restore the damaged lung cancer eroded by pneumococci to its original state. Because its ingredients are excellent, it can be taken in all seasons. All those suffering from lung disease should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Super-Special Therapy for Treating Pathological Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ling, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Seminal emission can lead to the loss of essential essence and blood necessary for our health. For this reason, it is generally considered dangerous and worrisome. However, if it is physiological, the danger is less. Pathological seminal emission refers to the discharge of semen, where erection and ejaculation are not under normal conditions, but an unpleasant leakage of semen. Generally, it starts during sleep, and sometimes the semen is discharged without awareness until the crotch of the pants is wet upon waking. The time intervals vary, with some occurring once a week and others once every three days. If the frequency of emission is high, the health prospects are even more worrisome!</p>
<p>The cause of seminal emission is mostly due to excessive masturbation. Therefore, to treat seminal emission, one must cut off the bad habit of masturbation and then apply targeted therapy. Taking the French seminal emission-specific drug "Nairus Seminal Emission Pills" before bed is highly effective, because this agent functions to strengthen the seminal gate and calm the brain nerves, preventing erotic dreams after taking it. In addition, electrotherapy and prostate massage can also assist in treatment. However, if the patient's constitution is damaged due to seminal emission, or if they suffer from neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, etc., they should also take "Vitaton," a male-specific preparation made from German testicular extract invented by Dr. Müllen, because it has incredible benefits for nourishing the brain, kidneys, and blood. This is the most advanced supplement of modern times.</p>
<p>A Brief Discussion of Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>Differentiation and Treatment of Urethral Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>If the differentiation of gonorrhea is inaccurate, it can lead to misdiagnosis and dangerous situations.</p>
<p>Only extremely scientific methods can be used to avoid being misled by the changes in the disease.</p>
<p>The most important thing in treating gonorrhea is the correct recognition of the symptoms. The work of differentiation must be carried out with the utmost care. Considering posterior urethritis alone, one can see that my statement is not false. When gonococci invade the posterior urethra, there are many differences due to the individual's nature and environment. However, if a rapid and appropriate treatment is given when it is about to invade, the area of the bacteria can be prevented from expanding day by day, and various complications can be avoided.</p>
<p>In general gonorrhea, the gonococci multiply on the surface of the mucous membrane from the anterior urethra to the posterior urethra. Although they gradually expand from the front to the back, it is not right to say that the pus flows backward from the front to the back when lying down or when the genitals are erect, thereby expanding the area of the gonococci. In addition, there are many cases in which gonococci invade the posterior urethra due to the patient's lack of health preservation or the doctor's unskilled surgery. Therefore, patients must pay twelve points of attention.</p>
<p>To treat this disease, a precise differentiation must be made before one can cope with it with ease. However, treatment is quite difficult, because it is extremely difficult to differentiate gonococci in our anterior urethra without precise examination. In the past, Mr. Wang Yurun suffered from gonorrhea and had consulted many doctors and taken various medicines, all of which were ineffective. He sought treatment from me, and after using the two-cup test method and microscopic examination, it was known to be posterior urethritis. I immediately used German electrostatic therapy, while prescribing the gonorrhea-specific drug "Clinon" as an internal medicine to completely eliminate the gonococci hidden inside the urethra, which took about three weeks. It has not recurred in the past three years. Consultation hours are from 10 AM to 6 PM. Twenty numbers are given out each day, with a registration fee of only 5 cents per number. A copy of "The Complete Book of Venereal Diseases," worth one day's work, is also given as a gift.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Surge Again Yesterday – Concessions Authorities Should Not Ignore – Price Increases Entirely Due to Speculative Manipulation – Rice Stocks Are Indeed Plentiful, and Supply from Various Regions Has Not Been Cut Off – – Unscrupulous Merchants Disregard the Livelihoods of Ordinary People and Should Be Severely Punished –</h3>
<p>The price of rice in the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market has soared, reaching a new high. Rice industry associations have reported this to the authorities in the concessions, requesting them to promptly devise solutions, crack down on speculative manipulation, and ensure smooth supply, so as not to affect social stability and the livelihoods of citizens. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar – Reaching a New High</p>
<p>Due to speculation and manipulation by hoarders in the bean and rice market, large amounts of capital continue to pour in, causing prices to rise to unprecedented levels. After the market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday, trading was chaotic. Changshu Special White Rice rose to a new high of 21.7 yuan, and all other types of rice increased by about one yuan. The Market Management Committee has been strenuously advising customers not to engage in rice speculation, so as not to affect the overall food supply for the people. However, speculators continue to manipulate the market, preventing rice prices from falling. Moreover, many hoarders are from outside the industry, making it very difficult for the management committee. The situation has been reported to the guild.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Authorities – Proposed Solutions</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Trade Association has reported the soaring rice prices and the manipulation of the rice market by speculators to the Public Concession's Public Works Department and the French Concession's Municipal Council, hoping that they will promptly take effective measures to: Crack down on speculators manipulating the rice market promptly; Ensure smooth supply from the inland to maintain the food supply within the concessions. Rice industry leaders have held informal discussions, believing that the rice industry association is powerless to deal with outsiders manipulating the rice market, and can only wait for the concession authorities to resolve the situation. At the same time, the Market Management Committee has been instructed to advise customers to sell within its power, to maintain the food supply.</p>
<p>Inviting Firms – Exerting Efforts to Advise</p>
<p>The Market Management Committee convened a meeting yesterday afternoon, advising 105 firms to maintain the food supply, stabilize rice prices, and ensure smooth supply. They also adopted indirect or direct methods to advise hoarders not to continue hoarding, so as not to cause rice prices to surge again. Although the firms have expressed acceptance of the advice, the effectiveness is difficult to predict. As for the rice arriving these days, although it has decreased significantly compared to before, the supply has not been completely cut off. For example, although the supply from the rivers yesterday was very limited, by both land and water routes, a total of 3,500 bags were transported from Changzhou and Kunshan, each bag containing one stone and five dou.</p>
<p>Rice Stocks Exceed 500,000 Bags</p>
<p>A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter specially visited a rice industry leader yesterday. According to him, the soaring rice prices were indeed unexpected, because it is now approaching the plum rain season, making hoarding extremely dangerous. The hoarded rice is easily moldy, so rice merchants within the industry would never dare to hoard. Outsiders, however, are unaware of the reasons and risk hoarding in order to make huge profits. According to investigations, current rice stocks within the Shanghai concessions, stored in various bank warehouses and warehouses, total more than 500,000 bags, with the Bank of China warehouses holding the largest number, followed by the Zhejiang Industry Bank, the China Industrial Bank, and other banks.</p>
<p>No Fear of Overall Food Shortage</p>
<p>As for the rice pre-purchased by residents, although it is impossible to investigate, it is estimated to be 400,000 to 500,000 bags. Therefore, there is no fear of an overall food shortage in Shanghai. The rice shortage situation of the winter of 1937 will not be repeated today. However, the soaring rice prices, approaching 22 yuan, are unreasonable. If speculative manipulation by hoarders can be cracked down on, the rice price in the market can be suppressed. Unfortunately, the rice industry association's power is insufficient and it cannot implement this. It can only hope that the concession authorities will intervene, otherwise, it is feared that rice prices will surge again.</p>
<p>Shanghai Merchants Build Warehouses in Haiphong – Tong Yi Shipping Company Warehouse Completed – Yuan Tai Lin Also Owns Customs Warehouse</p>
<p>Haiphong is now a major hub for the concentration of transshipped goods. The prosperity of cargo transportation is unprecedented. Therefore, in such a small area, goods awaiting shipment are piled up like mountains. Although the authorities are making every effort to ensure smooth passage, the lack of vehicles makes it difficult to achieve this in the short term. As for customs warehouse registration procedures, due to the customs' particular diligence, obtaining registration is also very difficult. Even Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire can only send their own Jianglun to anchor in Haiphong, as floating warehouses, to temporarily store incoming goods. The newly opened in this city</p>
<p>Tong Yi Shipping Company</p>
<p>was jointly established by Chinese employees of Wah Lun &amp; Co., Tian Xiang &amp; Co., and Zhongxi Shipping Company. Xu Lisheng and He Xiyu, two gentlemen of the company, are experienced in shipping and have extensive connections. Seeing the past difficulties in cargo transportation and customs warehousing in Haiphong, they specially entrusted Mr. Li Huo of Weitai &amp; Co. to go to</p>
<p>Haiphong to Find Land</p>
<p>and build a huge warehouse. It has now been completed. In mid-last month and early this month, they continuously opened the Han Lan Li and Anshan ships, directly to Haiphong, carrying more than 8,000 tons of goods.</p>
<p>It is Said That Yuan Tai Lin</p>
<p>Branch, the head office is located in Haiphong, also has its own registered customs warehouse. Recently rented a Anlikai Ma Le ship, carrying a weight of more than 6,000 tons, for the sake of prudence, only limit the loading of 4,000 tons, from today to sign the customs documents, set on the 22nd closure, the 23rd direct release Haiphong,</p>
<h3>"Avenue" Police Station of Great West Road – British Troops Stop Blocking – British Troops Have Also Withdrawn Nearby – Police Department Negotiations Concluded</h3>
<p>There is a police substation of Dadao at the intersection of Great West Road and Columbia Road in Shanghai, where puppet police are stationed. After the British military headquarters closed it down, the building was nailed shut, and barbed wire was piled up at the entrance to prevent re-stationing. Until the night before, several armed puppet policemen secretly entered through the back door and removed the barbed wire at the door. The British army discovered this and rushed to stop it. At that time, the situation at the scene was once tense, but fortunately, the police retreated and no accidents occurred. I went to inspect it yesterday afternoon and saw that the gate of the bureau was wide open and the interior had been cleaned up. There were several puppet police officers in the back, and all obstacles at the door had been removed. Judging from the situation, it seemed that they wanted to stay there for a long time. The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that the Public Concession Police Department and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" Police Bureau had concluded negotiations on the status of the "Municipal Government" police substation at the intersection of Columbia Road, Great West Road, yesterday (17th), with both sides satisfied. The British army has withdrawn from the vicinity of the bureau and allows the "Municipal Government" police to enter the building, stipulating that they must not act in front of the building on the road bordering the concession, and use the side door leading to the "Municipal Government" area for access during mobilization. Therefore, the barbed wire in front of the building has been removed.</p>
<p>Zi Lin Newspaper Said</p>
<p>The "Avenue" police station near Columbia Road, Great West Road, was ordered by the British military authorities to be barricaded in January. At 6:10 yesterday morning (17th), "Avenue" police sneaked in to open the door. Until late yesterday evening, British soldiers of the Dongxu Lai team were still stationed on the south side of Great West Road opposite the bureau. It is heard that the British military commander and the Japanese authorities have been negotiating since before yesterday evening in order to reach a compromise. Judging from the situation, the fate of the bureau may be peacefully resolved today (18th). It was found that the British army barricaded the front of the bureau in January.</p>
<p>When the British military authorities, who had a barricade to enter the Public Concession Road, heard the news, they sent</p>
<p>a squad of British soldiers</p>
<p>wearing steel helmets to station near the bureau and order the "Avenue" police to leave. No accidents occurred afterward. Until 1:50 p.m., two trucks carrying 60 "Avenue" police officers with rifles and pistols arrived at the scene and drove into the bureau. The British army then drove to the site again. After a British officer spoke with the Chinese "Avenue" police chief, the "Avenue" police retreated eastward</p>
<p>on foot</p>
<p>along Great West Road. At 3:00 p.m., Brigadier General Simmons, commander of the British forces stationed in Shanghai, also arrived at the scene and spoke with officers standing near the police station for several minutes before returning. At that time, two Japanese military photographers were busy taking pictures from a distance, especially of the sentries in front of the bureau and the four truckloads of British soldiers along Columbia Road. The reserve team of the Public Concession Police Department was also ordered to assemble at the Jing'an Temple police station to await orders, but were not sent to the scene of the incident because it was</p>
<p>not necessary to do so.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, barbed wire was unloaded from two military trucks, and 20 British soldiers wearing leather gloves re-erected the barricade, but the work was ordered to stop as soon as it began, and the barbed wire was removed. In the afternoon, Japanese officers in plain clothes and uniforms drove by the area several times in cars, but did not get out. At 9:00 last night, three British sentries were stationed on the other side of Great West Road. One foreigner and three Chinese personnel from the Police Department</p>
<p>were stationed in front of the bureau.</p>
<p>A camp was set up in an English garden on the south side of Great West Road, and the British soldiers stationed in Great West Road temporarily stayed in the tent. Although pedestrian traffic was not prohibited near the police station, there were very few pedestrians. A barbed wire barricade was erected at the intersection of the police station, but those living in the alleys could still enter and exit freely.</p>
<p>American Destroyer Squadron Sails to Yantai – To Participate in Summer Exercises. The Mainland News said that the US quick pursuit ship supply ship Black Devil and the 13th Destroyer Squadron of the US Asian Fleet will be docked in Shanghai for two weeks. Yesterday morning (16th), they set sail from Shanghai to Yantai for summer exchange exercises and target practice. After three and a half months of mooring in Yantai, they will return to Shanghai and sail to the waters off the Philippine Islands for winter training. The 14th Destroyer Squadron is also docked in Shanghai and is expected to leave Shanghai for Yantai next week.</p>
<h3>Safety Campaign – First Day of Promotion Week – Awarding Truck Drivers with No Accident Records – Xinhua Company Filming "Safety First" Movie – Promulgating Eighteen Rules of the Road</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Safety Campaign Promotion Week began yesterday. Trams, buses, taxis, freight trucks, rickshaws, self-owned vehicles, bicycles, and other vehicles operating in the concession were uniformly pasted with slogans or banners. Mr. Pike, Assistant Commissioner of Police and Director of the Traffic Division, together with personnel from the Public Utilities Company and the two Concessions' Vehicle Affairs Departments, inspected various roads by car.</p>
<p>Scouts Set Off – Assisting in Directing Traffic</p>
<p>The authorities also invited storytellers to go to various crowded places to tell short stories, explaining the need to be careful when walking. They also invited older Boy Scouts, dressed in plain clothes and holding flags, to distribute leaflets with concise text at various road intersections, and to persuade pedestrians not to linger on the road to avoid accidents. This can create a foundation of safety, improve traffic conditions in this port, and reduce the number of accidents in the city. In addition, dozens of employees went to public places, teahouses, and restaurants to conduct propaganda. More than 400 students from public and private schools subsidized by the Public Works Department's Chinese Education Department set out, holding "Safety First" command flags, to assist in directing traffic and distribute leaflets on rules of the road at Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Edward VII, and the Bund, and other major traffic arteries, advising pedestrians to pay attention to traffic safety.</p>
<p>Schools Hold Essay Contests</p>
<p>At the same time, the Academic Affairs Department was asked to issue a notice to all schools that teachers should teach a short "Safety First" course during this promotion week, and hold a short essay contest, judged by the teachers, and awarded by the committee. Chinese schools expanded their original lecture methods and studied safety issues. Western schools also added this type of course on a daily basis, and distributed tens of thousands of "Safety First" buttons to students to draw the attention of students' families.</p>
<p>Distributing "Safety" Commemorative Stamps</p>
<p>The association also asked truck owners to give bonuses to drivers with no accident records. The association also printed a large number of rubber stamps with the words "Safety First" and distributed them to various public utility companies and well-known commercial firms to stamp on all outgoing letters for widespread publicity and to achieve a grand effect. There were also announcements and statistical charts posted in the racecourse, dog racing track, and gas stations. At the same time, rickshaw groups and taxi groups dispatched personnel to guide the drivers.</p>
<p>"Safety First" Movie Premieres</p>
<p>In order to popularize the propaganda, the Public Works Department requested the Xinhua Film Company to produce a free "Safety First" film reel, directed by the famous director Bu Wancang. The film was donated by Kodak and Agfa. The film has been completed and was previewed at nine theaters, including the Da Guangming, yesterday morning, with more than 25,000 viewers. It will be distributed to various cinemas for simultaneous public release and printed with multiple copies, welcoming factories, schools, and public organizations to show it for free to facilitate publicity. Those who want to rent it, please call 10704, or go directly to BecK α Swann Foreign Company at 17 Bund and contact Mr. A. Pullen.</p>
<p>Public Works Department Formulates Rules of the Road</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has formulated the following eighteen rules of the road: (1) Do not walk on the road where there is a sidewalk; (2) Do not walk on the sidewalk edge in the same direction as vehicles; (3) When walking from the sidewalk onto the road, pay attention to whether there are vehicles coming and going; (4) When walking on the sidewalk, keep to the left; (5) If there is no sidewalk, walk against the direction of traffic, that is, keep to the right side of the road; (6) When crossing the road, look right first and then left to see if there are vehicles coming and going; (7) Cross the road straight, do not cross diagonally; (8) Be especially careful when crossing out from the front and rear of vehicles, or when there are obstacles blocking the line of sight on the road; (9) When crossing an intersection, cross when the vehicles on the cross street stop; (10) Do not rush across the road when vehicles on the cross street are about to come; (11) In an emergency, know that the safest place is in the middle of the road, do not rush to retreat; (12) Know that cars, bicycles, and rickshaws do not have a fixed route; (13) Do not call for rickshaws on the opposite side of the road; (14) Know that vehicles traveling at high speed cannot be stopped immediately; (15) When crossing the road, it is best to cross at an intersection controlled by traffic lights; (16) Use the refuge station in the middle of the road as much as possible; (17) Do not stop on the road, and be careful when turning; (18) Know that the road is for public use and anyone can use it.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Sailing to Ningbo – No Need to Apply for Approval for Each Trip – Still Need to Comply with the Measures for Sealing the Seaport – Passenger Transport Is Absolutely Prohibited, Limited to Loading Cargo</h3>
<p>After the Ningbo Defense Command allowed Ningbo to resume navigation in order to facilitate cargo transportation, various foreign shipping companies immediately sent ships to resume navigation. However, they must apply for approval for each trip. The foreign ships sailing include Xin Beijing, De Ping, Ende, and Moufu. Now the Ningbo Defense Command has been ordered by General Liu, Commander-in-Chief of the 10th Army Group, to allow all ships that have been approved to sail to Ningbo in the past to sail freely without having to apply for approval for each trip. However, passenger transport is still prohibited, limited to loading cargo. However, if government officials and public servants have important official business that requires them to go to Shanghai, they will be issued a pass to board the cargo ships. As for those who have been approved to sail to Ningbo in the past, there are 11 routes including Shanghai-Wenzhou-Ningbo, Shanghai-Hong Kong-Ningbo, and Ningbo-Dinghai-Xiangshan, and 47 foreign ships including Nanchang, Ninghai, and Lisheng. All foreign ships sailing must strictly comply with the newly promulgated Temporary Restrictions on the Import and Export of Goods by Sea at Zhejiang Seaports. The Defense Department will notify the Shipping Association and the Customs Brokers Association.</p>

<h3>Two Concession Tram Companies – Already Using Tokens – Ministry of Finance Will Issue and Transport Vouchers to Shanghai for Remedy – Copper Coin Shortage Panic Expected to Subside</h3>
<p>The lack of copper coins in the Shanghai market has caused difficulties for all industries. The public bus and tram companies in the British and French concessions have been using tokens since yesterday to facilitate passengers. The Ministry of Finance will issue vouchers for transport to Shanghai to remedy the copper coin shortage, so the copper coin shortage wave is expected to gradually subside in the short term. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>French Tram Company Tokens</p>
<p>Trams and buses in the French Concession have found business difficult because they refuse to accept postage stamps. In order to remedy this, the company authorities have been using tokens since yesterday. These tokens are divided into one-cent and two-cent types, made of cardboard, with Chinese and English translations, and are only valid within the French Concession. The following is a notice from Mr. Viali, the company's Traffic Manager: "The company's one-cent and two-cent tokens are only valid within the French Concession. Each ticket seller can receive a maximum of two yuan, to replace the lack of legal tender, and should not give change arbitrarily unless absolutely necessary."</p>
<p>Public Concession Tram Company</p>
<p>Although the British tram company in the Public Concession does not refuse to use postage stamps after the copper coin shortage wave, it is more difficult for ticket sellers to sell tickets and calculate fares. Therefore, taking the same step as the French Concession tram company, it also issued two-cent and three-cent tokens yesterday. They are printed on thin cardboard, three-cent in light lake green, and two-cent in coarse rice color, which are easy to distinguish. The vouchers are printed with Chinese and English instructions and printed with red Arabic numerals "3" and "2". The Chinese "Three Cents" and "Two Cents" are in hollow characters. The bottom of the voucher is punched with a line eye, and the top is printed with a number. The company stipulates that these tokens can not only be used on the bus, but also be cashed at the company's office at 185 Suzhou Road.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Will Issue Vouchers for Remedy</p>
<p>All industries use postage stamps as small change in business, and because it has gradually become accustomed to over time, the panic is not as serious as at the beginning. It has been found that the problem of smuggling copper coins out of Shanghai occurred after the National Army moved west, so the government has long paid attention to this. According to silver industry news, the Ministry of Finance will issue vouchers for transport to Shanghai to remedy the copper coin shortage, so the copper coin shortage is expected to be eliminated in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Shipping from Shanghai to Funing to Open Soon</p>
<p>Shipping from Shanghai to Funing has been suspended since last winter, and it has been half a year since now. Goods in the area are piled up like mountains and cannot be cleared. It is now heard that the Shanghai De Yi Xiang Company has agreed with the authorities and has chartered the Greek ship Li Wu Duo, with a load of more than 2,000 tons, to sail soon.</p>
<p>New Spanish Consul Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Spanish Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Fei Lianlai, is about to step down and return home. The post of new Consul General has been filled by Mr. Yu Er from the Spanish Franco government, who has arrived in Shanghai for some time. Mr. Yu is a famous Spanish aircraft pilot, and is particularly good at driving locomotives.</p>
<h3>Foreign Trade – Barter Pays Off – Tea for Soviet Union, Tung Oil for US – Major Exports Can Utilize New Transport Lines</h3>
<p>Since the trial of barter trade in foreign trade, it has been quite effective. As a result, China's tea exports to the Soviet Union have surged, all concentrated in Hong Kong for export. From January to April, tea exports from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union were 19,903,258 pounds, with a total value of HK$8,227,774, accounting for more than 80% of the export amount. In addition, the export volume of raw silk, tung oil, hog bristles, casings, and fur has not decreased sharply due to the war. It is heard that the barter method will be gradually promoted. It is now being implemented with tea in exchange for Soviet goods and tung oil in exchange for US goods.</p>
<p>Allocating Ten Million to Promote Production</p>
<p>After the Executive Yuan issued an order to all provinces to promote production and instructed the competent authorities to allocate funds, it was decided to allocate 10 million yuan from the competent authorities for the development of inland production. Guangxi, Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangxi, and Yunnan were designated to improve seeds, promote sideline industries, prevent and control pests, study water conservancy, and reclaim wasteland in agriculture. In industry, they would improve technology, promote national goods, promote small industries and handicrafts, develop mining and metallurgy, and revitalize rural finance, and improve the organization of various industries.</p>
<p>Concentrated Exports for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Since the Trade Commission implemented export management, it has assisted in exports worth no less than tens of millions of yuan, and concentrated foreign exchange exports of nearly tens of millions of yuan. The tea, oil, and silk stored in Hankou, as well as the silk and tea in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, have all relied on the commission's efforts to clear and rush transportation to reach Hong Kong for foreign exchange. Other coordination of transportation and purchase of materials from various provinces has also been quite successful. Recently, it has also increased the handling of barter trade with a certain country, and its business has therefore developed further. It is expected that the value of managed exports this year will be even greater than in the previous two years.</p>
<p>Opening New Routes to Promote Trade</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Shanghai, foreign trade was concentrated in Guangdong and Hubei. After the withdrawal from Guangdong and Hubei, foreign exports were able to be shipped out via Haiphong, all thanks to the encouragement and assistance of the central government. The sharp increase in trade volume in various customs areas in the rear and the continuous increase in the export value of certain commodities could not have achieved such good results without the intervention of the Trade Commission. Recently, the central government accelerated the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway and newly established a certain company, which is a good phenomenon in the war of resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>Collection Methods for Wartime Taxes – Exempt in Combat Areas – Normal Collection in Areas Close to the War Zone</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the Ministry of Finance believes that the war zone is expanding day by day, and the tax burden on the people in the war zone and areas close to the war zone should be appropriately reduced and exempted to show compassion. It specially issued an order to all provinces and cities: A. All taxes should be abolished in the combat area, and the people in the area should be advised to refuse to pay any taxes collected by any party; B. Various local taxes in the combat area should be postponed, reduced, or exempted, and the competent authorities of each province should decide separately based on local conditions, and order the financial authorities in the area to implement them. The collection and location should be made as convenient as possible for the people, and the military should be strictly prohibited from directly collecting taxes, apportioning taxes, or illegally requisitioning them from the people; C. All legal local taxes in areas close to the battlefield should still be collected as usual, but excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes must be completely abolished, and apportionment and illegal requisitioning must be strictly prohibited. The above measures should be used to set up a wartime economic commission according to the same plan for research at any time.</p>
<h3>US Fleet Commander Goes to Tianjin – Denies Having a Mission – Will Stay in Tianjin Briefly and Then Go to Qinhuangdao – People Believe He Will Investigate the Situation There</h3>
<p>The Mainland News said that reliable news was received here last night (17th) that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the US Asian Fleet, who is currently touring in Beiping, is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin by train on the 20th of this month. Local US naval authorities do not recognize the Japanese claim that Yarnell will go to Tianjin by warship or that there is any special significance. It is said that Yarnell had scheduled his trip to Tianjin before the British and French concessions were blockaded. The American expatriates in Tianjin originally planned to host Yarnell at the American Chamber of Commerce, but because of the Japanese blockade, the procedure has been changed, and he will be entertained at the YMCA on the Outer Racecourse Road in the British Concession. It is heard that Yarnell will stay in Tianjin for one or two days, attend the reception, and then take the train to Qinhuangdao, where his ship Augusta is currently docked, but people believe that Yarnell will take advantage of his trip to Tianjin to directly investigate the situation there, as it is related to the American expatriates in Tianjin.</p>
<p>###梵王渡頭　Visiting Mr. Bu Fangji (Part 1) NC</p>
<p>Before the record of my visit to Mr. Bu Fangji on the island, it is worthwhile to revisit old dreams from more than ten years ago with a childlike heart.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Shanghai's two highest institutions—St. John's and Nanyang—always had several football games every winter. The spectacle was like that of Harvard and Yale. Not only the alumni and students of the two schools came to cheer, but people from society also took it seriously, making time to travel far to watch. I remember one year, about two weeks before Christmas, we took turns to go on a long journey. We ate an early lunch, formed a mighty team, and headed west along Hongqiao Road, straight to Xujiahui Station. One by one, we boarded a special train. Half an hour later, our Nanyang cheering squad was already roaring on the football field across the river from St. John's.</p>
<p>This time, in extreme danger, we won a goal. Everyone was ecstatic, hats flew in the air, and the passionate mood still lingers today. I also remember that on the way back, I walked with two classmates, not taking the train. We turned from Yidingpan Road to Xujiahui Road—now Haig Road. We talked and laughed all the way. The winter twilight was especially lovely. From the distant woods, we saw a few streaks of red clouds. In order to enjoy the evening scenery, we didn't feel tired at all.</p>
<p>Of course, St. John's also often won against us. Their students also returned home happily, stepping in a long line.</p>
<p>The most memorable thing in life is the past. Today, standing at the gate of St. John's University, these past events evoke endless melancholy! What about our alma mater?</p>
<p>The trees along Yuyuan Road appeared particularly lush green in midsummer. The road was smooth and lovely, and the car sped along without any unusual feeling. Turning a corner, nearing Shanghai West Railway Station, the scene changed drastically. Flags fluttered in the wind, and the houses were incomplete and dilapidated. I was really afraid to look, and I really didn't want to look out the window. Fortunately, this short stretch of road disappeared in just three minutes. Turning another corner, quietly and windingly, a small road covered with green shade appeared in front of us. At the same time, I saw the Suzhou River again, as if meeting an old friend. My heart instantly calmed down.</p>
<p>S and I always go together. To visit Mr. Bu Fangji, he naturally had to come along too. Nearing the gate of St. John's, the school staff had already opened the two large gates. We took out our name cards and said we wanted to visit Principal Bu.</p>
<p>"Is it Old Mr. Bu?" a uniformed staff member asked.</p>
<p>"Um!" We found it a bit funny. Perhaps that's what they called Principal Bu.</p>
<p>The staff member stood on the footboard, acting as a guide. We got out of the car in front of Mr. Bu's residence.</p>
<p>Looking at my watch, it was exactly 1:50, ten minutes before our two o'clock appointment with Mr. Bu. We wandered around the porch.</p>
<p>"Old Mr. Bu is taking a nap. I don't know if he's woken up yet," one of the staff members inside the house said.</p>
<p>This place is truly beautiful, truly serene. A vast expanse of grass, interspersed with large trees, set off the surrounding environment in a very antique and natural way. This surrounding scenery reveals a peaceful and solemn atmosphere, not vulgar or excessive at all. I fear most the gardens of wealthy families, everything is new, a bit shocking. What is seen here is entirely old. St. John's is indeed a respectable family! Human wisdom is half from talent and half from environmental cultivation. The contribution of St. John's graduates to society and the country undoubtedly largely comes from the ancient environment and excellent training.</p>
<p>In the distance of the grass, we saw a mule pulling a mower, doing the work of cutting grass. We had seen motorized mowers or manual labor, but this was the first time we had seen a mule doing it. In the green field, this mule added a lot of natural interest.</p>
<p>Then we were led into the reception room. This was a room facing the handrail, and the entire layout surprised me a bit. The simple furnishings here were full of antique charm. A long table was of the old Chinese style, appearing elegant. Next to the window was a rattan sofa, covered with light green cushions, which reflected each other with the interwoven green leaves outside the screen window. This room was a bit like a Bungalow on the mountain. This is the life of seclusion in the countryside.</p>
<p>On the wall, there was a wooden couplet, which read:</p>
<p>"Tea Fragrance Purple Bamboo Shoots Dew,</p>
<p>Zither Rhythm White Duckweed Breeze."</p>
<p>As we were admiring it with fascination, the sound of the host coming downstairs interrupted our thoughts.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Bu did not look like a 75-year-old. His hair was frosty white, but he looked energetic. He had a tall figure and a kind face, not much different from how he looked more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>After we exchanged greetings for a while, the host invited us to his office.</p>
<p>In this square office, we could not find a single modern piece of furniture. The desk was quite large, surrounded on three sides. On this table, I don't know how many years Old Mr. Bu has spent?</p>
<p>Next to the stove, there were two rattan chairs standing side by side. Opposite was a more comfortable large chair. The host kindly insisted that I sit on it, saying, "This is the guest's chair!"</p>
<p>On the wall were couplets written by He Shaoji:</p>
<p>"Rice seedlings are green, white egrets descend,</p>
<p>Mulberries are ripe, yellow cranes sing."</p>
<p>In the middle of the two couplets, there was also a horizontal plaque with the words "Joy in Zither, Books, and Interests." Hanging such fine couplets in this antique office was especially appropriate in the current season. We looked around. Aren't the rice seedlings green? Aren't the mulberries ripe?</p>
<p>Next to the door, there was also an authentic Chinese-style long desk, piled with many books. A table of this shape is not easy to find in Shanghai.</p>
<p>S and Old Mr. Bu sat side by side, and the conversation began with Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Bu is an old friend of Shen Bao. He said: "Shun Pao is the best paper in Shang-hai."</p>
<p>He expressed great admiration and regret for Shen Bao's suspension last year. Every year he went to Qingdao to escape the summer heat, he always notified the school to have Shen Bao sent to him daily, so for decades, he met with Shen Bao every day. He believed that Shen Bao was fair in its attitude, elegant in its writing, and constantly progressing with the times. It was China's only leading newspaper. (The following is continued by S)</p>

<h3>On the Upper Floor of Fulo, Guangxi Road: A Woman is Murdered; Corpse Found on Bed; Niece Discovers Upon Visiting; Police Dispatch Officers to Investigate the Truth</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8 o'clock, a bloody incident occurred in the pavilion room on the third floor of No. 51 Guangxi Road, at the Zhu Fuxing Buddhist Goods Store. The murderer fled the scene immediately after the incident. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Sudden Female Guest Rents Empty Room</p>
<p>Zhang Wenxiang, the second landlord of No. 51 Guangxi Road, works as a qin player at the Qunfang Association in the Great World. The storefront of the house is rented to Zhu Fuxing, who runs a sculpture idol store named Zhu Fuxing Buddhist Goods Store, entering and exiting through the front door. Zhang himself lives on the front floor of the second floor, and the rest is rented out to others, totaling five or six households. Because the second landlord himself didn't have enough space, on May 20th, he instructed to build another wooden room on the third floor's platform. While construction was underway, a female guest in her twenties, claiming to be surnamed Gao, said she and her husband wanted to rent the room. At that time, it was stated that the monthly rent was 6 yuan in national currency. On May 26th, the woman moved in furniture, including only a wooden bed and two tables and chairs, nothing else. However, the second landlord never saw a man entering or exiting, nor did she usually cook meals.</p>
<p>Niece Visits; Alluring Corpse Lies Across</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, yesterday morning around 7 o'clock, a woman arrived, speaking with a Changzhou accent. She was the woman's niece, visiting her aunt from the countryside. Pushing open the door, she saw her aunt (the woman renting the room) lying across the bed, covered in blood. Extremely frightened, she cried out. The roommates and the second landlord heard the alarm, got up, and went to see. They immediately reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives. The woman had already died. They immediately sent the deceased to the mortuary for an autopsy. At the same time, they took the deceased's niece back to the police station. According to her, the deceased was her aunt, named Gao Yangshi, 24 years old. Her uncle was named Gao Rongsheng, 28 years old, who worked as a peddler on the boats. Gao Rongsheng fled immediately after the incident. Whether she was killed by her husband or there are other reasons, it is currently impossible to find out. The police are currently investigating.</p>
<p>Pharmacy Boss Forces Maid; Zhou Cuiyun Demands Living Expenses</p>
<p>The defendant has not arrived, so the formal prosecution is underway. Zheng Jialing (67 years old), the owner of Jiahe Pharmacy in Jiyang Lane, No. 6 Henan Road, from Cixi, was recently sued by his maid, Zhou Lingyun (28 years old), from Ouxiangshan, who hired lawyer Feng Song to file a complaint with the First Special Court, requesting payment of 20,550 yuan for living expenses and medical expenses. According to the court records, on the 17th, Judge Wu Shaochang attempted to mediate in the first court. The opposing party, Zheng Jialing, allegedly is not in Shanghai at the moment, and no one received the summons on his behalf, so he did not appear in court. Because mediation failed, the court ordered a formal prosecution.</p>
<h3>Two Major Fires at the Pudong Gonghexing Wharf Last Night; Most of the Two Thousand Bales of Cotton Burned</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, yesterday (the 17th) before dusk, two fires broke out at the Pudong Gonghexing Wharf. About two thousand bales of cotton stored there were severely burned. At 6:05 PM, two fireboats received the report and rushed to the scene of the incident. Upon arrival, they saw that half of the four thousand bales of cotton stored in the "B" warehouse were already on fire. They did their best to extinguish the fire to prevent the flames from spreading to neighboring houses. Since 5:30 PM, when the fire was first discovered, the Chinese and foreign firefighters of the wharf's own fire brigade had been extinguishing the fire on the scene. However, because the number of water pipes was insufficient, they could not control the flames. An hour later, a firefighter went to change clothes near the "C" warehouse, 120 yards away from the burning warehouse, and discovered that several bales of cotton in the "C" warehouse were also on fire. The fire brigade rushed to put out the fire. By dawn today (the 18th), the smaller fireboats were still anchored at the scene to prevent the embers from reigniting. Soldiers of the Japanese Marines, armed with rifles and bayonets, remained stationed at the scene throughout yesterday afternoon. Several Pudong police officers also prevented coolies from approaching the fire pit. The cause of the fire is not yet certain and is currently under investigation. However, it is reported that the warehouses were all locked at exactly 5 PM, and the fire was seen thirty minutes later. Many believe that a major fire was prevented due to the immediate action of the members of the in-house fire brigade.</p>
<h3>False "Livestock Market" Attempts to Monopolize Fresh Livestock Industry; Includes Chicken, Goose, and Duck Industries in Addition to Cattle and Sheep; Industry Peers Discuss Response Measures</h3>
<p>The so-called "Shanghai Livestock Market" organized by the Japanese puppets originally occupied the Yuezhou Road slaughterhouse as its slaughtering site. Fresh pig merchants, deeply aware of righteousness, refused to cooperate. The Japanese puppets, out of anger, used special forces to detain cargo ships in fresh pig production areas without permission, forcibly transporting them to the Hongkou district for slaughtering and market sales, taking the opportunity to raise pork prices, causing the fresh pig industry to be forced to suspend operations. It is now learned that the Japanese puppets, in order to conspire to monopolize the business, have decided to implement further plans, including slaughtering fresh livestock such as chickens, geese, and ducks, in addition to pigs, cattle, and sheep, providing large quantities, in order to control the market. It is rumored that they have occupied dozens of acres of land on Tongzhou Road to build a large-scale slaughterhouse, and are currently undertaking large-scale construction. If this plan is implemented, all industries will be severely affected, and it will also concern the needs of citizens' lives. Therefore, all industry peers will conduct discussions in the coming days to discuss countermeasures in order to resist illegal behavior.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Smoke Emission Issues; Letter Requesting Company's Attention</h3>
<p>Public buses in the concession often emit thick smoke, which is annoying. The Public Works Department has repeatedly negotiated with the British-owned China General Omnibus Company. Recently, the Bureau reported that various public buses still have this unpleasant phenomenon from time to time. Therefore, it sent another letter requesting the company's attention. The police had obtained a report from the London Passenger Transport Board, which contained various facts regarding the issue of smoke emission from buses. The report was forwarded to the bus company by the Public Works Department so that the company could have a basis for solving the cause of smoke emission. It is learned that the company replied in a letter stating that not every bus owned by the company emits unpleasant thick smoke. In fact, this situation has been greatly reduced recently. Some older, low-speed vehicles inevitably emit smoke at times. The main reason is that passengers are crowded, resulting in excessively long driving times. In addition, some vehicles occasionally leak smoke. However, this type of situation is unavoidable by public buses in any country. As for excessive smoke, it is not caused by the long years of driving the vehicles. The company sent a letter to the Assistant Commissioner of Police on December 2nd of last year, explaining the difficulty that all the company's vehicles could not be repaired on time due to the sudden increase in passengers compared to previous years, and said that when new vehicles are added to various routes in the future, the company will be able to increase the number of repairs so that the above-mentioned situation can be improved. The London Passenger Transport Board report attached by the Bureau has been reviewed. The company is well aware of the various reasons stated in the report, and the company has made every effort to adopt various measures to reduce smoke. Part of the new vehicles ordered by the company have arrived and will be put into use soon. The number of repairs will naturally increase in the future, so that passengers will not feel inconvenienced. The Commissioner of Police will submit reports to the Bureau on this issue on time in order to continue to find ways to ban it.</p>
<h3>Gao Lansheng's Condition Unchanged After Being Shot</h3>
<p>The details of the shooting that occurred on Shantou Road the night before last have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to news from last night, Gao Lansheng from Hangzhou, who was seriously injured, underwent surgery by doctors after being admitted to the hospital. Because his condition has not yet left the dangerous state, doctors ordered him to refuse visitors. The night before last passed well, and there were no changes in yesterday's situation. However, his condition has not been alleviated. Whether his life is in danger will have to wait for a considerable amount of time. Only if the injury does not change significantly can it be determined. In addition, lawyer Jin Yu and Rong Kun, who were also shot at the same time, were slightly injured and are expected to recover soon.</p>
<h3>Woman Sentenced for Transporting Opium</h3>
<p>Liu Zhaonian, a Chinese detective from the Narcotics Division of the Inspectorate General, learned that opium dealers often traded opium with Chaozhou woman Ma Zhengshi at the Beizhan Hotel, No. 43 Jielu. He then pretended to be a client and ordered eight liang of opium from Li Qing, who was at large, for 100 yuan, agreeing to deliver it to Room 2 of the hotel at about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. In time, Ma arrived and was arrested by Liu, along with eight liang of opium, and taken to the Huishi Police Station, where she was transferred to the women's detention center. The day before yesterday, she was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted her for transporting opium. Judge Jiang Shuzi, after questioning her, sentenced Ma Zhengshi to two years and six months of imprisonment, and the opium was confiscated and destroyed.</p>
<h3>Landlord and Tenant Assault Each Other Over Rent; Both Severely Injured</h3>
<p>Gu Fusheng, a local from No. 155 Jinxiu Lane, Binlang Road, demanded the rent from Peng Daishi, Peng Zhushi, and other tenants from Tongzhou at about 10:00 PM on the 14th of this month, resulting in a quarrel. Each led their children and daughters-in-law to engage in a major fight. As a result, landlord Gu Fusheng was struck in the left hip with an iron bar, and it is feared that his wrist bone has been broken. Peng Daishi's thigh was also stabbed with a knife, and her injury was also very serious. Afterwards, Zheng reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which sent detective Kong Guangxiao to the scene and arrested Gu Fusheng, Gu Qianshi, Gu Jinmei, and Du Fuchuan on the landlord's side, and Peng Daishi, Peng Zhushi, Peng Qiaoshi, and others on the tenant's side, a total of nine people. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case, prosecuting both sides for assault. Because both sides' testimonies were unclear, the court ordered the defendants Gu Fusheng and Peng Daishi to be released on bail of 50 yuan each for medical examination to determine whether their bones were damaged. The remaining defendants were remanded in custody and will be heard again on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Jade Pagoda Lost and Found</h3>
<p>Gu Jingqi, a merchant from Yangzhou residing at No. 7 Lafayette Road in the French Concession, recently had a jade pagoda worth 600 yuan stolen by thieves who climbed over the fence. At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, Xu Decheng, a Chinese detective from the Gordon Road Police Station, arrested a suspect from Yangzhou named Zhu Lun (29 years old) at No. 480 Edward Road, recovering the pagoda, which was exquisite and pleasing to the eye. The day before yesterday, he was escorted to the First Special Court. The owner sent a representative, Lai Wenyuan, to explain the details of the theft. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody for further verification.</p>
<h3>Man Commits Suicide After Being Abandoned by Mistress</h3>
<p>Wang Rongfu from Ningbo, 37 years old, residing at No. 4, Lane 217, Gansu Road, Youfu Lane, recently developed a love affair after being abandoned by his mistress. Wang was unhappy and then thought of suicide. He found three poisonous powders used in chemistry. At 9:00 PM on the 17th, he checked into Room 45 of the Ningyu Hotel, No. 91 West, at the intersection of Edward Road and Mintini Road (opposite the Great World) in the French Concession, under the pretext of staying overnight, and committed suicide by taking poison. The next morning, tea boy Cai Zhigen discovered it and reported it to the accounting room. Wang was sent to Renji Hospital, but because he was deeply poisoned, he died an hour after being admitted to the hospital. The hospital reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate and summoned the deceased's wife, Wang Heshi, to the case. The corpse was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy, pending a report to the court for inspection.</p>
<h3>Former Police Officer of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Caught with Gun and Counterfeit Money; Claims He Was Asked to Carry It by a Chinese Detective Informant</h3>
<p>Li Jingtai (34 years old) from Shandong, residing at No. 162 Yidingpan Road, previously served as a police officer in the Chinese Municipal Public Security Bureau. At about 1:00 PM on the 9th of this month, he was riding a free car with a concealed broken automatic pistol and counterfeit bills of exchange, two for five yuan each from the Bank of Communications, and one for five yuan from the Central Bank, wrapped in newspaper. Near the intersection of Connaught Road and Kesefei Road, he was stopped by Chinese police officer No. 2258 and taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. He claimed that the gun and counterfeit money were given to him by Ge Yuting from Anhui, an informant for the Chinese police officer, to take to a certain place temporarily, promising to pay him 20 yuan, etc. The police station postponed the arrest of Ge and sent him to the court for custody. The day before yesterday, they were sent together to the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, requesting an investigation of the two defendants. Each held to their own words, but Chinese police officer No. 2258 proved that Ge Yuting was indeed working as an informant elsewhere. The case of Li committing the crime of carrying a gun and counterfeit money was reported by Ge in advance. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that they still be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<p>Automobile Driver Crushed</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 PM, automobile driver Xiao Zhenfu (38 years old, from Suzhou), residing at No. 9, Lane Shundong, Ganshi East Road in the French Concession, was driving a black-licensed car to a gas station opposite the Paramount on Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai. While he was refueling the car at the rear, another black-licensed car (No. 3442) also drove to the station to refuel. When the car entered the station, due to excessive speed and unstable brakes, it knocked down the driver Xiao Zhenfu in front, breaking his spine on the spot. Xiao's internal organs were also severely injured. Afterwards, the car that caused the accident took him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. His life is in danger.</p>
<p>Bandit Leader Gao Shunyu Apprehended and Executed</p>
<p>Gao Shunyu, the leader of the bandits in the guerrilla area of western Shanghai, had dozens of followers. Under the guise of a guerrilla team, they openly kidnapped people for ransom under the pretext of extorting donations, rampaging in the area around Hongqiao Road Airport. Farmers with some wealth in the surrounding villages were repeatedly kidnapped and none were spared. As a result, the people hated them to the bone but could do nothing about it. The matter was learned by a certain unit of the regular army stationed there, which immediately issued a warning. However, Gao and his bandits were unrepentant and continued to rampage as before. At about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Gao swaggered along with two of his accomplices to sip tea at a small teahouse in Wujia Lane. They were detected by the garrison who, without making a sound, suddenly sent a team to arrest them. Gao and his bandits were caught off guard. By the time they realized the situation was bad and wanted to escape, the surrounding area was heavily guarded and the troops were everywhere, making it impossible to escape. They surrendered. The army believed that Gao's crimes were extremely serious and could not be tolerated. After interrogating him, Gao admitted to many cases of kidnapping and was immediately identified. At 8:00 PM that night, he was tied to the execution ground and executed by shooting, and his crimes were announced as a warning.</p>
<p>Counterfeit Money Organization Salesman Sentenced to Two Years in Prison</p>
<p>A man named Yang Guiyun, 35 years old, residing at No. 29 Chong'an Lane, Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, was a salesman for a counterfeit money organization in Caojiadu. Recently, he was arrested by the French Concession police for using counterfeit money in the Tushanwan area. The counterfeit money that was seized was brought to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. He was prosecuted for using counterfeit money. After trial by Judge Liao, Yang Guiyun was sentenced to two years in prison some days ago.</p>

<h3>FLEETING CLIMATE, DISCOVERY OF CHOLERAIC DIARRHEA, VARIOUS INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE QUITE PREVALENT, AFFECTING HEALTH, CITIZENS TAKE NOTICE</h3>
<p>The weather in this city has been changing rapidly in recent days. Sometimes there are downpours, sometimes the scorching sun is in the sky, and the temperature fluctuates erratically, resulting in the prevalence of various infectious diseases, such as measles, malaria, beriberi, dysentery, relapsing fever, typhus, and so on. Choleraic diarrhea has also been discovered, which has a significant impact on the health of residents. Attention should be paid to this.</p>
<p>LARGE NUMBERS OF SHIPS BLOCKED OUTSIDE BEIXINJING</p>
<p>Beixinjing Ferry is an important waterway for inland river traffic. Recently, due to the unrest in western Shanghai, security has been tightened, and ships and pedestrians passing through must undergo strict inspection. It is learned that in recent days, two to three hundred ships from the mainland heading to Shanghai have been blocked outside Beixinjing due to the lack of permits and other reasons. Although the ferry service from the concession to Beixinjing has resumed, there are very few passengers.</p>
<p>THREE STEAMSHIPS PERMITTED TO ENTER WENZHOU DAILY, DEPARTING SHIPS ARE STILL SCHEDULED AND NOTIFIED BY THE AUTHORITIES</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Wenzhou sea route was approved by the authorities for regular resumption, passengers and goods traveling between Shanghai and Zhejiang have been concentrated on this route for transit, so the transportation of passengers and goods is very prosperous.

Chinese police officers No. 711 and No. 3369 were on duty nearby and rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. At that time, one bandit was leaving the house to escape and was captured by the police officer. He then re-entered the house and asked the victim to identify the suspect. He saw two bandits with weapons coming downstairs and attempting to resist arrest by opening fire. The two police officers immediately fired four shots, killing one bandit on the spot. Another bandit also fell to the ground and died within 200 yards of the scene. The Municipal Council's Police Department, recognizing the police officers' dedication to their duties and their commendable competence, submitted a request to the Board of Directors to award each of them a special police service merit medal as an incentive.</p>

<h3>COMMEMORATING THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF GORKY'S DEATH</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ou Zhi</p>
<p>——Translated from the Soviet "Literary Calendar"——</p>
<p>Three years ago, on June 18, 1936, Gorky, the greatest writer of our generation, passed away. He died on the battlefield and was poisoned by the lackeys of the fascists. Molotov said at Gorky's memorial service: "After Lenin, Gorky's death is the most painful loss for our country and for mankind."</p>
<p>In the early 1890s, when the flames of the proletarian revolutionary struggle were burning more and more brightly in Russia, when the great Bolshevik Party was founded, Gorky came out with his earliest works.</p>
<p>Gorky came from the deepest strata of the people. According to his friend Romain Rolland, he had suffered from childhood "the poverty and humiliation that make up the fate of the enslaved proletariat." He maintained a close relationship with the working class forever, "He is the true founder of socialist literature in the working class society of our country and the world proletariat." (Molotov)</p>
<p>Gorky said: "Writers think that literature is their private affair... This is the most harmful nonsense. Literature has never been the personal affair of Stendhal or Tolstoy, literature is always the cause of the times, the country, and the class." Gorky's creation is the cause of the working class, the cause of the Russian people. At the same time, it is also the cause of the entire progressive humanity, because Gorky is a writer of enormous world scope, belonging to the workers, peasants, and freedom-loving intellectuals of all nations and all countries. No writer's name is more famous among the world proletariat than Gorky's name, and no work is more loved by workers of all countries than Gorky's Mother.</p>
<p>Along with Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, Gorky gave boundless meaning to the creative possession of the literary heritage of the past. Gorky learned a lot from the great masters of Russian and world literature. He was the heir and continuer of the best traditions of Russian and world literature. He was the living link between socialist literature and Soviet literature.</p>
<p>He inherited its humanism from progressive classical literature, as well as its respect, attention, and love for people. But he did not stop at the stage reached in this regard by the most glorious figures of the old literature before the socialist era. He went far ahead, becoming the initiator and ardent protector of socialist new humanism. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>ON THE LONGHAI RAILWAY (PART 1)</h3>
<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>From Shangqiu to Lanfeng</p>
<p>The countryside is filled with the breath of the night, and stars twinkle in the sky, shining with faint light.</p>
<p>Our party of four, accompanied by a briefcase containing important things - it is burdened by a brother. Relying on the help of starlight, we move on the winding path; wheat stalks grow on both sides, swaying in the starlight. We quickly pass through the wheat fields with intertwined wheat shadows.</p>
<p>The brother carrying the heavy burden is walking faster and faster, and our pace is also speeding up. Strength is concentrated in both legs, and no one has opened their mouth. In the silent space, only the monotonous carrying pole accompanies the brisk footsteps with a squeaking sound. Our destination, Shangqiu Station, is reached in this accelerated pace -</p>
<p>Running into the station, A-Fa suddenly becomes active. He first discovers that a row of trains facing west are lying obediently in front of the station, and he jumps up with joy, shouting loudly: "Our luck is really good!" The quiet air is broken by him!</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, I don't think it will be so cheap!" Lao Yu is not optimistic about this train.</p>
<p>We put our luggage and briefcase aside, and the brother is responsible for guarding, then run close to the train.</p>
<p>There are no lights in the carriages, and a large pile of dark heads flicker in the darkness; they are the cells of the country, and now they are a mass of people who are groping at the beginning of awakening. When asked when they will arrive here, their answer is: It has been two nights!</p>
<p>We ran into the stationmaster's office. The stationmaster is busy working on the telephone, and the pen in his hand is quickly sliding on the paper; he smiles and nods to us, meaning to greet us.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, stationmaster, when will the train in front be able to start?" I asked as soon as he took the microphone away from his hand.</p>
<p>"There is no certain time for this train, because there are too many trains heading east, and they are more needed, so the westbound trains cannot be predicted..."</p>
<p>"Then will there be a wounded soldier train coming down tonight?" I interrupted him and asked.</p>
<p>"Wounded soldier train? -" He flipped through the book he had just written on. "——Yes, probably around twelve o'clock." The words are very certain.</p>
<p>"Then let's wait for this train!" I looked back at the other comrades. From experience, I know that the wounded soldier train is faster and spends less time at each station. They all have no objection.</p>
<p>Waiting for a train is the most boring and impatient thing. We want to make time pass faster, so we chat with the stationmaster casually. He is very eloquent, like a slick, pot-bellied merchant.</p>
<p>But I don't think this method is effective. I desperately smoke cigarettes, one after another, and a large pile of cigarette butts and matches has accumulated. The clock on the wall still does not want to move forward so leisurely.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, another two hours have passed. A pleasant message comes from the phone, saying that the wounded soldier train has left the previous station. But it will take almost an hour to get here.</p>
<p>Four or five carriages are already full of comrades who have been wounded for justice, talking loudly about the things they think are proud of on the front line; some are vigorously waving their injured arms, forgetting the pain of the body; and from time to time they make loud laughter. Although it is midnight, they are not tired.</p>
<p>In order not to infringe on their rights, and even more so not to make them more crowded, we decided to carry our luggage and briefcase to the roof of the car, and people lay down on the arc-shaped roof.</p>
<p>The train moved slowly in the stationmaster's whistle; we drove through the cracks of the trees on both sides, lying flat on the roof of the car, admiring the silvery white sky, the flashing stars, and the hazy countryside. The fatigue of the past few days has been conquered. I thought of the night ferry in Shanghai in summer, and we forgot our situation. I almost felt that I was bumping on the night ferry again.</p>
<p>In the night breeze, I felt a little cold, and I covered the military blanket next to me on my chest. The brother leaning on the briefcase has already started snoring softly, and the car continues to drive straight through the cracks in the trees. (Charity sale donation)</p>
<h3>DANGEROUS BUILDING</h3>
<h3>CONFUSED ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>— Bian Luo</p>
<p>"Confusion" is generally regarded as a not-so-bad shortcoming in modern society, which seems to be better than "evil"; if someone borrows money to gamble it all away, it is a moment of confusion, if he robs with a knife, it is a bit of "evil". But there is also confusion that is praised, "reading without seeking thorough understanding", "not seeking thorough understanding" is a bit "confused", but after Tao Yuanming's leisurely visit, he won everyone's praise, it seems that confusion also has art. Like the ordinary so-called drunkard, they are mostly a little confused and criticized, but Li Taibai is not. Zheng Banqiao said something like "rarely confused", which can be said to be advocating confusion, and now there are still people talking about it, which shows that things in the world are originally different and ingenious.</p>
<p>Confusion also has true and false distinctions. The confusion of the so-called celebrity hermits is mostly not "true foolishness" but "pretending to be". Li Taibai, in addition to drinking, can also hum something like "clouds want clothes and flowers want appearance", so even today the tavern still wants to use "Taibai's legacy" as a gimmick. And Liu Adou is a practitioner of "life is proud and must be happy". Moreover, "I am happy here, not thinking about Shu" is also his honest words, but he has been laughed at and scolded to this day. In fact, no matter whether your confusion is true or false, if you try to use "purity", "seclusion" or other beautiful names to cover up your confused complacency, it will eventually be in vain. Liu Adou is a confused egg that should be laughed at and scolded, but in modern times, trying to escape by confusion can only prove your own decline.</p>
<p>The most in the world are self-righteous confused eggs. They are not only confused themselves, but also hope that others are as confused as them. "Seeking skin with a tiger" should be an ideal fool. But some people kowtow to the tiger and beg for mercy, or send up some pork and beef or one of their own hands and feet, hoping to give the tiger satisfaction, until they know they have been taken by the tiger, they should sincerely ask the hunter, but they are afraid of killing all the tigers in the world, making the world too quiet. There are many such confused eggs in the world. As for their own clay feet are already unstable, but they still hope to beat others to kneel, their ambition is commendable, but in reality it is confused incompetence.</p>
<p>Also, if you put on a peaceful mask, make a set of nonsense about losing both sides, regardless of right and wrong, and want to use surrender as complacency, such people cannot escape their guilt by confusion. There are many precedents in history, but what is the result? It is said, "Stinking for ten thousand years!"</p>
<p>There is such a joke: "A nosy person took pity on Qin Hui and Wang's statues kneeling in front of Yue Wang's tomb, dismantled them and threw them into the river, so as not to be humiliated all year round. But that night he had a dream, dreaming that Qin Hui and Wang came to thank him. When he woke up in the morning, he thought: Qin Hui is so efficacious, if Yue Wang is efficacious, what should I do? He hurriedly went to the river to pick them up and repeatedly asked them to kneel there, and after that, no one went to dismantle them again, and they became forever damned." The joke is unrefined, but the love and hatred are very obvious. Qin Hui also doesn't look very smart, and the nosy person is not confused to the end, and finally wakes up and understands the truth of what ordinary people call good and evil. I hope that the well-meaning people of today will not be so confused!</p>
<h3>Impressions of a Mountain Tour (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>The Taoist priest led us up the stone steps again, preparing to return to the road. Suddenly, he stopped, shouting: "Fa Liu, Fa Liu! What are you up to over there... Hurry up and bring back the firewood!"</p>
<p>We looked in the direction of the Taoist priest's gaze and discovered some movement in the deep weeds, with a child's voice muttering. As we were paying attention, the Taoist priest put on an indifferent air, saying, "It's nothing, it's nothing, let's just keep going."</p>
<p>After walking no more than twenty or thirty steps, a monk, as wild as a buffalo, scrambled out of the bushes and fled down a small path.</p>
<p>Following the road upwards, for no more than three li, there was a nunnery. As we passed the gloomy entrance of the nunnery, I wondered: Why would there be a nunnery here?</p>
<p>Turning past the stone steps, we discovered a pure white stone pavilion, which was "Halfway Pavilion." The reason it was praised was simply because some important people had inscribed it. The pavilion was indeed built well, but it was so isolated and out of the way that it was easily overlooked by visitors.</p>
<p>Crossing the road from Halfway Pavilion, following the Taoist priest's instructions at parting, we climbed up two sets of stone steps and arrived at a villa with an inconspicuous name. The man who came out to greet us was also dressed like a broker, but a strong sense of commercialism made me think that he hadn't worn a cassock for very long. This fake monk showed us around the house for a while and let us stay on the steps outside the window, enjoying the breeze and the mountain view. Soon, tea was brought up, and the fake monk said:</p>
<p>"Our boss is from Jiangxi, runs a medicinal herb store, and has quite a bit of money in hand. This house was built for him to spend the summer."</p>
<p>"We're not planning to rent," said Da Peng.</p>
<p>The architecture of the house was still good, facing the valley between the east and west mountain ranges, allowing us to see the lush greenery and the prosperity of the houses. However, the ingenious "Halfway Suspended Clouds" were lost here; at the same height, from the same viewpoint, there was such a different transformation!</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Leaving the Jiangxi man's villa, after a winding mile or so, we found the mountain villa where Li Jing of the Tang Dynasty lived in seclusion. The house was large and had been repaired many times, so it was not ancient. Although the pillars and beams had been freshly painted and the walls freshly whitewashed, we still couldn't feel any modern flavor. The bamboo forest was so elegant, and the mountain cliffs behind the house were so upright and beautiful. When visiting West Lake, the lonely situation of Bao Puzi's mountain hut was much different. But there was no one living in the house; on the steps, there was a handful of straw, two charred bricks, a pile of chicken feathers, and some ashes. I didn't know if some travelers had come here for a picnic, or if it was the traces left by a large number of beggars who had cooked chicken, eating it clean.</p>
<p>Lazily, we walked out of the mountain path and continued along the road.</p>
<p>In the distance, there was the sound of cuckoos, as if coming from the farmers' houses in the valley. But as the journey progressed, the soil content gradually decreased, and the barren rocky layers gradually increased. The density of the lush green gradually became sparse, and the barren cliffs that did not show vitality in spring gradually increased.</p>
<p>"Sir, have a good heart, give us some charity, spend some money."</p>
<p>"Spend a few coins, sir, with great virtue and generosity!"</p>
<p>Beggars wearing long gowns followed us, but they were all poor farmers from this area, strong, dark, and without any signs of illness. It was not easy for them to live on this high, barren land more than twenty li from the ground. We were willing to share some food with them because they were not without hope of survival; they were still healthy and should have a meaningful existence. Sickness, disability, and deformity should be entrusted to the god of death: but we must help human beings with the power to survive.</p>
<h3>Night Question</h3>
<p>— Yan Qi</p>
<p>Blue sky, dreamless night,</p>
<p>Rain and wind in the lamp's light,</p>
<p>Picking up a cluster of stars and moon bright,</p>
<p>Shining on a goddess' face of white.</p>
<p>Suppose it's by the lake at midnight,</p>
<p>Where is tomorrow's human light?</p>
<p>A journey of wandering, a journey of thought,</p>
<p>Hanging question marks in the clouds, caught.</p>
<h3>Talking Extra</h3>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>On the Legislative Issues of Ethnic Minorities in Southwest China</h3>
<p>— Ding Yuchang</p>
<p>Anyone who has traveled to or delved into the history and geography of the western border regions of our country knows that, in addition to the Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan ethnic groups, there are many other ethnic minorities distributed throughout the western provinces and regions. Roughly speaking, such as the Lieluo and Baiyi in Yunnan, the Ming Fan ethnic group in Xikang, the Miao and Yao in Guizhou, the Yao and Peng in Guangxi, Guangdong, and western Hunan, the Li ethnic group in Hainan Island, and the Yi ethnic group in the old Jianchang Dao eight counties (now under the jurisdiction of Xikang Province) of Sichuan... totaling no less than several million people. Guizhou Province is the most prominent, with the saying that the province's population is "four Han and six Miao." The aforementioned ethnic minorities, combined with the Hui ethnic group in Xinjiang and Gansu, the Tibetan and Fan ethnic groups in Tibet and Qinghai, the Mongolian ethnic group in Mongolia, and the Manchu ethnic group in the far northeastern provinces that have not been sinicized, should total no less than twenty to thirty million people. In our country, due to the large population of the Han ethnic group, it is still a small number in comparison. According to anthropological research, these ethnic minorities are most closely related to the Han ethnic group in terms of bloodline. And due to historical wars and commercial relations, they have close political, economic, and cultural relations with the Han ethnic group, but on the one hand, they still maintain their unique culture and language, and have not been completely sinicized. Even in terms of law, although laws have been implemented in various provinces and regions throughout the dynasties, continuing to maintain their unity, for the aforementioned ethnic minorities, they have mostly been regarded as outside of civilization, and have not been strictly implemented, even to this day.</p>
<p>Throughout the dynasties, the central government's relationship with the ethnic minorities in Southwest China (including the Miao, Yao, Li, Lieluo, and Baiyi) was that it maintained suzerainty, while allowing their rulers to manage their tribes, and had very little direct contact except for tributes and wars. They were also not like the Manchu and Mongolian ethnic groups, who had entered the Central Plains and ruled the Han ethnic group, and had legally placed themselves in a superior position, such as the Jin Dynasty's legal provisions for the three classes of "Zhong Ren," "Han Ren," and "Nan Ren," the Yuan Dynasty's division into the four classes of "Mongolian," "Sèmù," "Han," and "Southern," and the Qing Dynasty's division into "Banner People" and "Han People," etc., in order to oppress the Han ethnic group. Their economic lives were mostly stuck in hunting, nomadic, or early agricultural societies. From the perspective of historical materialism, their ideology was confined to the scope of tribes or feudalism, which was different from our Han ethnic group, which had entered into a commercial society. Therefore, the laws created by our Han people are naturally difficult to apply uniformly to these ethnic minorities. From the Rebellion of the Five Barbarians at the end of the Jin Dynasty to the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the Han ethnic group continuously used force to conquer them, oppressing them to penetrate deep into the mountains of southwest China. After the Tang Dynasty, the surrendered tribal leaders or meritorious generals were often granted hereditary official positions, establishing the Tusi system. The Tusi was the highest and sole ruler within his feudal tribe, while the Han official yamen was in the lowest position. This feudal Tusi had the concept of "I am the law" for his subordinates. Under his rule, the ethnic minorities had the power of life and death at his whim, and the central government or local officials never had the opportunity to advise. As a result, this ethnic group lived in dire straits, and rebellions occurred frequently. After the implementation of the "Replacing Native Officials with Appointed Officials" policy at the end of the Qing Dynasty, the feudal Tusi political system was gradually abolished, the regular local government was reorganized, and this ethnic minority was liberated, placing them among the common people. Wherever the native officials were replaced with appointed officials, most of the ethnic minorities had been sinicized, making it difficult to maintain their culture. However, even now, this feudal Tusi political system has not been completely eliminated in various border areas. Even in places where appointed officials have been nominally established, due to poor management by the authorities, they are still in name only, and the real power is still in the hands of the descendants of the old Tusi, which is not uncommon. Therefore, the status of these ethnic minorities is not equal to that of the Han ethnic group in reality. The Provisional Constitution stipulates that all citizens of the Republic of China are equal, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, or occupation, which has not been implemented in the southwestern provinces, which is by no means an exaggeration.</p>
<p>In the past, Guangxi was the first province in Southwest China to actively seek liberation for ethnic minorities in politics. Guangxi was also the fastest and most widespread to sinicize ethnic minorities. Decades ago, most of western Guangxi was under the rule of Tusi. Today, except for the Yaoshan Mountains between the Liujiang and Guijiang Rivers, where some Yao ethnic groups remain, there is no trace of the Tusi political system. The Yunnan Provincial Government, after the establishment of Xikang Province in the western border areas, is said to be setting up bureaus to influence the Yi ethnic group (located in the old Jianchang Dao eight counties) who have never interacted with the Han ethnic group. This shows that after the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the shift of the political center to the western plateau, the central government is actively promoting the work of liberating ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>We should certainly liberate the ethnic minorities who are under the oppression of feudal Tusi, so that they are in an equal position with the Han ethnic group in law and in fact, but whether we should make them eliminate their inherent written language and thoroughly sinicize them is a question that can be discussed. For the legislation of ethnic minorities in Southwest China, in principle, it should be based on Mr. Sun's legacy, and in terms of technology, we hope that the government will consider the following points:</p>
<p>First, the central and local legislative bodies should have representatives of various ethnic minorities to participate, so that they can contribute their opinions as much as possible on the special legislation for their ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Second, the validity of the written languages and languages of ethnic minorities should be confirmed in law. Ethnic names that contain insults or contempt for Chinese characters should be prohibited from use, in order to harmonize ethnic sentiments.</p>
<p>Third, areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities should be divided into "legal regions" different from those of the Han ethnic group. The current civil, criminal, and commercial laws should be applied in consideration of their economic life and cultural level, and taking into account their inherent good customs, and the scope of implementation should be appropriately determined. Or even formulate separate regulations, so that there is the possibility of implementation.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Tusi system must be abolished. Special legislation must be enacted to assist the development of ethnic minorities' production and construction, education, and culture.</p>
<p>We believe that legislation based on Mr. Sun's legacy will be the beginning of the liberation of ethnic minorities in Southwest China.</p>

<h3>Can a Signature on a Negotiable Instrument Be Replaced by a Fingerprint?</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaowen</p>
<p>According to the provisions of Articles 21 and 121 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the issuance of bills of exchange, promissory notes, and checks must be signed by the issuer, and other acts on negotiable instruments, such as endorsement, acceptance, and guarantee, also require the signature of the endorser, acceptor, guarantor, etc. as a necessary condition. This is because, according to the provisions of Article 82 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, when a negotiable instrument is not paid or accepted when it is due, the holder may exercise the right of recourse against the endorser, issuer, and other debtors on the negotiable instrument after exercising or preserving the rights on the negotiable instrument, and according to the provisions of Article 2 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, anyone who signs on a negotiable instrument must be responsible for the text on the negotiable instrument. If the debtor on the negotiable instrument does not express his intention by signing, the holder will have no basis when exercising the right of recourse.</p>
<p>Therefore, the signature on the negotiable instrument should be clear. Ancient Chinese characters are not acceptable. However, according to the provisions of Article 3 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the signature on a negotiable instrument can be replaced by a stamp or fingerprint, which is really incomprehensible. Although using a stamp to replace the signature on a negotiable instrument is different from the interpretation of common characters, it can still be said to be recognized by the general public. However, using a fingerprint to replace the signature means that there is no standard for the type and style of the fingerprint, which will inevitably make it impossible for the holder to know who drew it, which will greatly hinder the circulation of the negotiable instrument and the exercise of the right of recourse. In civil acts, because there are specific parties involved, even if the signature of the parties is replaced by a fingerprint, cross, or other symbol in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code, there is no obstacle. However, it is undesirable to recognize that the signature on a negotiable instrument can be replaced by a fingerprint.</p>
<p>Since the signature on a negotiable instrument can be replaced by a fingerprint, illiterate people can also use the provisions of the Civil Code to make a fingerprint, which is unacceptable. Therefore, in my opinion, the words "fingerprint" in Article 3 of the Negotiable Instruments Law should be deleted. As for the proposal of the Bankers Association to add the words "or" under the words "stamp" to the Legislative Yuan, it is also irrelevant.</p>

<p>Collection of Judicial Decisions</p>
<p>(Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court) When there are the same or similar legal reasons, it should be considered that there are the same or similar legal effects, which is a matter of course in jurisprudence (Shanghai Zi No. 42 in the 28th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>Although partners do not need the consent of other partners to transfer shares to each other, if they only transfer shares to the manager and there is no obvious intention to express withdrawal from the partnership to other partners, it cannot be considered a legal withdrawal. The transfer of shares only transfers the proportionate share of the partnership property to others, which has nothing to do with the status of the partner. If the transferor does not perform the procedure of withdrawing from the partnership and notifying, it cannot be considered that the partnership relationship between the transferors has been terminated for other partners. Even for the transferor himself, he is still a partner. The so-called intention to express withdrawal from the partnership to other partners, if only the transferee records the transfer of shares in the partnership resources book, it is difficult to have the effect of withdrawal (Shanghai Zi No. 44 in the 28th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>The court should review the facts in accordance with the meaning of the debate and the results of the investigation of evidence, and make a judgment based on free judgment. If the reasons for the judgment obtained are not contrary to the law, the parties shall not make further disputes based solely on empty words (Shanghai Zi No. 53 in the 28th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>Important Legal News</p>
<h3>Those Who Are Incarcerated and Drafted into Military Service Should Be Allowed to Serve Outside on Bail</h3>
<p>There is considerable doubt as to how to handle cases where criminal detainees are drafted into the National Military Service by drawing lots, as there are no provisions in the Enforcement Regulations of the Military Service Law prohibiting or suspending service, nor is there any other basis to rely on. The Ministry of Justice previously submitted a request to the Judicial Yuan for verification. It is now known that the Judicial Yuan issued Order No. 2663 to the Ministry of Justice on December 19, 27th year of the Republic of China, stating that the Provisional Enforcement Regulations of the Military Service Law have been drafted by the Ministry of Military Affairs in April of this year and submitted to the Military Affairs Committee for instructions to be temporarily implemented. Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the draft amendment to the regulations states that active-duty and age-eligible personnel who have one of the following matters may postpone their enlistment year, which is called postponement of service, and Paragraph 5 states that those who are suspected of criminal offenses and are still in court but have not been convicted shall still receive education and conscription for the National Military Service, etc. According to this provision, criminal detainees who are drafted into the National Military Service by drawing lots shall be allowed to serve outside on bail if they are in the period of receiving education or conscription.

<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>— (Feng Meixue)</p>
<p>(Question) Jia married Yi in the 24th year of the Republic of China. After the marriage, they did not get along. A year later, Yi left Jia's house and has been missing ever since. (1) Can I apply to the court for mediation and divorce in accordance with Article 1052, Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 9 of the Civil Code? (2) Can the mediation procedure be bypassed? (3) Can the mediation statement or the statement of claim and the application for public delivery be sent to the court at the same time? (4) Can I publish an announcement in the newspaper for three days, limiting the time to express my intention and notify the address within one week? Can this reminder be used as evidence of application for public delivery and malicious abandonment? (5) If Yi returns home as soon as the announcement is published, and Jia is unwilling to take her in and still wants to file for divorce, is it legal? (6) What form should the application for a one-sided debate and judgment be in, a written statement or a verbal statement? (Wang Shan)</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) Article 1052, Paragraph 5 of the Civil Code refers to malicious abandonment. Based on the circumstances described in your letter, it cannot be immediately considered malicious abandonment. Paragraph 9 of the same article refers to those who have been missing for more than three years. Although Bing left Jia's house, she may be at her mother's house, or her mother's house knows her whereabouts, and she cannot be immediately identified as missing. (2) Divorce cases should be applied for mediation first according to law. (3) If mediation is possible, please apply for mediation first, and then file a lawsuit after mediation fails. If the location is indeed unknown, you can apply for public delivery. If Yi is at her mother's house, or her mother's house knows her whereabouts, you should not apply for public delivery. (4) It is difficult to predict whether Yi will see the newspaper that was published, and it is difficult to use this as evidence. (5) Before a legal divorce, Jia has no reason to refuse to take her in. Based on the circumstances described, divorce should not be granted at all. (6) You can apply verbally.</p>
<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3>The Cheapest Season for Crime</h3>
<p>— (Useless)</p>
<p>Criminal law has "fixed-term imprisonment," "two months or more and fifteen years or less," and the period is calculated in months. Therefore, committing a crime and being sentenced to two or three months, in February of each year, is the cheapest season, because February is a flat month, with only twenty-eight days, and although March has thirty-one days, April has thirty days. If you encounter July, August, or the 13th month of January, they are all thirty-one days, so the difference is two or three days.</p>

<h3>All Shanghai Cinemas Will Add "Safety First" Movie</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Han Langan and Sang Shuzhen both worked as extras to explain the humorous "pushing, staring, dangerous."</p>
<p>"In 1938, there were as many as 15,810 road accidents in Shanghai, resulting in 213 deaths and 4,953 injuries." This is a shocking number!</p>
<p>Because of the occasional negligence of both drivers and pedestrians, such shocking and unfortunate events occur, but people never pay attention to how to avoid the occurrence of such unfortunate events. The "Safety First" campaign recently promoted by the Public Security Bureau of the Concession is to pay attention to the cooperation of drivers and pedestrians to avoid the recurrence of such unfortunate events. Since its implementation, they have added patrol posts at intersections to guide and correct pedestrians and drivers' traffic rules, and use wireless broadcasts and various entertainment venues to constantly advise people on the meaning of "Safety First."</p>
<p>Recently, a "Safety First" movie has been produced by the cooperation of Ike Fa Coda and Xinhua Film Company. The whole film is 1,300 feet long and will take about ten minutes to show. From today, all Shanghai cinemas may add this film.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Public Security Bureau first performed it for reporters from various newspapers in Daguangming. Therefore, I also got to see it first.</p>
<p>The content of this movie is the same as the "Safety Campaign" announcement posted in the two concessions, but the actual performance allows everyone to have a deep impression on how these unfortunate events occur, and at the same time, how to avoid them.</p>
<p>Actors from Xinhua Film Company, such as Sang Shuzhen and Han Langan, all worked as extras. The performance of these common comedians on the screen will make people more deeply remember the "Safety" impression.</p>
<p>The narrator is said to be Mr. Chen Dabei, using Shanghai dialect, and quite humorous. For example, it is most dangerous for children to play on the road. The picture shows a group of children kicking a ball. When chasing, a car drives from behind. The children cannot avoid it and are run over. The narrator: "This child is the only son of the three families!"</p>
<p>In addition, bicycles cannot be loaded with heavy objects behind them, otherwise the center of gravity will be unbalanced and the body will be crooked. This is very dangerous when a car comes from behind, so the explanation is: "Why put so many things on the bicycle?"</p>
<p>Other warnings, such as pedestrians not being able to cross in front of vehicles, not being able to call rickshaws across the street, etc., when the picture shows the danger that occurs as a result, it says "Danger?"</p>
<p>"Pushing, staring!"</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that using movies for publicity is certainly more effective than adding patrol posts and posting announcements. Because every driver and pedestrian thinks that nothing unfortunate will happen to their driving and walking before the accident, and after the accident, both sides have to shirk responsibility and think that the fault lies with the other party. Now this "Safety First" movie clearly tells both sides what time and what place is likely to be dangerous, and uses the camera's eye to deeply imprint it into the brain.</p>
<p>From this, we know that the publicity power of movies is greater than that of words. Then, I think that merchants who use this as a profit-making tool, what reasons can they use as "excuses" in the future?</p>
<h3>Mr. Yuan Songnian's Recent Work</h3>
<h3>How Painting Can Be Called Vital and Lively (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>During the Kaiyuan period, General Pei Min, while in mourning, visited Wu Daozi and requested him to paint a mural at the Tian Gong Temple in the Eastern Capital. Daozi said, "My painting brush has long been neglected. If the General has divine skill, first dance a sword dance for me." So Min took off his silk robe and galloped like the wind, whirling left and right, waving his sword into the clouds, as if lightning struck down. Min drew his hand to hold the scabbard, pierced through the stopper and the person. All those who witnessed the scene were amazed. Daozi then picked up his brush and painted on the wall, and a gust of wind arose, creating the most magnificent scene under heaven. Daozi's life was dedicated to painting, and he considered this his most successful work.</p>
<p>Wu Fenyang, Zhao Zong, once had Han Gan paint his portrait, and everyone praised its excellence. Later, he had Zhou Fang paint it again. Guo Zhang was present, and they couldn't determine which was superior. One day, Zhao Zong's wife, Madam Ning, came to visit. Fenyang asked, "Which one is more like me?" She said, "Both are similar, but the former captures Zhao Lang's temperament, his way of talking and laughing."</p>
<p>Liu Songnian had an enemy who painted a picture. When the teacher of the painting school went out, everyone was pushing to have a theatrical scene painted, with every posture fully rendered. The enemy, Bao Fu, imitated it. When he came to a boy holding a bamboo pole with spider silk, and the spider was going up and stopping, as if alive, he couldn't help but put down his brush. Indeed, a master has a skill that is unattainable by others.</p>
<p>The righteous Marquis Ma once loved a painting of a cow returning to its pen. One day, he displayed it outside his study. A tenant farmer standing below the steps stared at it for a long time. When he left, the Marquis saw him and called out, "I have a prized painting. Why are you laughing at it?" The tenant farmer said, "I am not a connoisseur of paintings, but I know a real cow. When a cow is returning to its pen, its tail is clamped between its thighs, and even strong men working together cannot open it even slightly. The tail of the cow in this painting is raised, so I laugh at its inaccuracy."</p>
<p>Emperor Huizong of Song loved painting. He once ordered students to paint peacocks ascending a stool on a screen, but none of them satisfied him. He then ordered other students to present their works one after another, but even with the greatest effort, none were accepted. So they went together to ask for instructions. The emperor said, "Whenever a peacock ascends a stool, it must lose its left foot. In all of your paintings, they lift their right foot first. Observe it, and you will see it is true." The artisans were then convinced of his precise understanding of things.</p>
<p>In the past, Meng Chang obtained a painting of Zhong Kui by Wu Daozi. The second finger of Zhong Kui's left hand was digging out a demon's eye. He ordered Huang Quan to change it to the thumb. Huang Quan then used his elbow to paint on silk and presented it. Chang asked him why, and Huang Quan replied, "In Wu Daozi's Zhong Kui, all the strength and spirit are in the second finger, which cannot be changed. Although my painting is not as good as Wu's, all the strength and spirit are in the thumb, which cannot be moved."</p>
<p>Bi Hong, a minor official of the Tang dynasty, was famous at the time. When he saw Cao Zao's painting, he was greatly surprised and impressed. He asked Zao who had taught him. Zao said, "I take nature as my teacher and find the source in my heart." Bi Hong then laid down his brush.</p>
<p>Mr. Jian Chu Tang Zai wrote in his "Mirror of Painting" that the "Night Rain over Xiaoxiang" painting is the most difficult to conceive. Song Fuguo's "Eight Views" are quite difficult to depict. The sound of bells cannot be painted, and in "Night Rain over Xiaoxiang," it is already night, and it is raining again, so what can be seen? It is said that Fuguo first painted and then conceived the idea, only roughly showing the misty and fading scenery. Later mediocre artisans, learning to paint this theme, illuminated the cables with torches and reflected the ships with lonely lamps. Their vulgarity and shallowness are obvious.</p>
<h3>Clear Sky After Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Scarlet Beauties Avenge, Difficult to Erase Misdeeds; Green Windows Discuss Love, Renewing a Good Relationship</p>
<p>Pan Peiying received a piece of happy news that came out of the blue today. The person whom she thought she would never see again had been resurrected. This was truly the so-called "reviving the dead and restoring flesh to bone," a joy that exceeded all expectations. Hearing Yuan Shuwen's words, it was clear that Zhao Ertian was not dead, and this was absolutely certain. But Pan Peiying was anxious to ask where Letian was at this moment. Just as she was about to ask, Yuan Shuwen continued, "Mr. Zhao is also in Wuxi. Did you not know? I heard that his grandfather used to run a rice mill, it seems that the place is in Xueyan Bridge. Now Mr. Zhao has inherited his father's business and has a National People's Food Commission. Each province has established a People's Food Protection Committee. Wuxi has always been a place where grain and rice are concentrated. Before the war, it was a place where rice markets gathered, and it has become even more prosperous after the war. I heard that Mr. Zhao has been sent by the Jiangsu Provincial People's Food General Festival Committee to be in charge of rice regulation matters in Wuxi. I only know a rough outline, it was something they mentioned occasionally, but the detailed situation is unknown." Pan Peiying thought: "Sure enough, he is in Xueyan Bridge, then it will be easy to find out. Indeed, the government has recently made a lot of efforts regarding the people's food problem. This problem, in China, has been a major problem for thousands of years. When we were young, we also read a passage from Mencius saying: 'If there is a famine in Henan, then move its people to Hedong, and move its grain to Henan. If there is a famine in Hedong, do the same.' It can be seen that in ancient times, people often migrated to find food, probably because of the inconvenience of transportation. Because transportation was not available, one place was often crowded, and another place lacked. Those who held to local narrow-mindedness would even be suspicious of people from their own country. During the war, it goes without saying that there were also unscrupulous merchants who caused trouble. After the war, the people's food is the first thing, and in view of the famine after the Soviet Union's Great Revolution thirty years ago, we must pay attention to it carefully. This regulation mechanism is to prevent the place where rice is produced from being crowded, and the place where rice is not produced from lacking. And it is also necessary to make transportation appropriate, so that the price of rice in all parties can be balanced. Wuxi was originally a rice-producing area, but the rice it produces each year is only enough for local needs. Because Wuxi is now more prosperous, and it is a factory area, more rice is needed. But Wuxi has always been a place where rice markets are located, a place where grain is concentrated, and all the rice mills and so on are here, so the Jiangsu Provincial Regulation Committee wants to send special personnel to be stationed here."

<h3>"Artificial Cotton"</h3>
<p>— Xian Ren</p>
<p>Worn for a few days, it stretches five or six inches; Washed a few times, the material becomes fuzzy.</p>
<p>With the change of the seasons, the clothes that protect the body must also be changed! Fur robes and camel's hair should be put away in boxes, and even lined clothes are no longer suitable. Therefore, these days, single long gowns and single cheongsams are perfect. As long as you pay a little attention to the people coming and going on the road, who isn't wearing a beautiful so-called "Paris" long gown? However, unfortunately, a bad phenomenon is happening at this time.</p>
<p>Originally, people wanted to make some economic calculations. They couldn't afford "real Paris" at more than a dollar per foot (except for a few bourgeois), but they wanted to be fashionable, so they had to look for substitutes. A type of "fake Paris" made of "artificial cotton" became popular for a while. Whether it was men's long gowns or women's cheongsams, it was quite popular in the market. Probably because things made of this "artificial cotton" are quite cheap, only three or four cents a foot, which is naturally much more cost-effective than "real Paris" at more than a dollar a foot. But, please observe carefully, is this "artificial cotton" a domestic product? Is it a domestic product? Humph! Then you've been fooled!</p>
<p>According to a friend who is familiar with this matter, the "artificial cotton" that is being sold as fake "Paris" in the market is not a domestic product. You must not be fooled. They use its low price to win the favor of the general public! It's embarrassing to say, but in fact, many friends have been fooled!</p>
<p>"There is another drawback," that friend told me: "This kind of 'artificial cotton' is fine when you first wear it, but after three or four days, it will stretch out elastically, at least five or six inches longer than the original. At that time, it is not only unsightly, but also inconvenient to walk."</p>
<p>"If you wash it once or twice, the material will become fuzzy, and it won't last long if you wash it more often," he continued. "People are neglecting future troubles for the sake of immediate cheapness."</p>
<p>Friends! What are your thoughts after hearing the above words? If you still have a conscience, you should be aware of it!</p>

<h3>Situation in the Jiangnan Examination Hall</h3>
<p>The literary atmosphere in Jiangnan has always been strong, and there are even more candidates this year. Even after adding examination booths, more than six thousand people were still turned away. Those who entered the examination hall in both Upper and Lower Jiang numbered over ten thousand. The first examination hall was sealed early, and the second examination hall was slightly renovated, which led to overcrowding and chaos, almost causing trouble. More than ten scholars died in the examination hall, including a few who died from illness, but many were claimed by vengeful spirits. Countless others were delirious and unable to finish the examination. Here are a few examples to serve as a warning. Heaven's law is immutable; how can we not fear it?</p>
<p>One wrote a four-line, five-character poem on the examination alley: "One, two, three, four, five; the drum sounds on Mingyuan Tower; sister sleeps on the bed; the lover suffers in the examination hall." He went mad and died. One night, a candidate suddenly muttered to himself, as if arguing with many people. The neighbor secretly listened but could not hear clearly, knowing something strange was happening. Later, he heard a loud cry, "I'm leaving!" The next day, he was found dead, his whole body black and blue. One slapped his own cheeks repeatedly, then used a small paper-cutting knife to cut out his own heart, bleeding to death.</p>
<p>One finished his paper and recited it aloud, very pleased with himself, certain that he would pass. Carrying the paper to submit it, he passed by the furnace and suddenly threw the paper in. Others snatched it away, but half of it was already burned. He seemed to wake up from a dream and said, "Walking to this place, someone told me, 'This is the place to submit papers,' so I threw it in." When asked what grievance he had, he remained silent and left.</p>
<h3>Population of London</h3>
<p>The King of Persia visited London and asked a British official for the actual population. The British official replied, "According to the population map from two years ago, plus the natural increase of 140,000 in the past two years, the population is 4,025,609. If the streets in the city were connected end to end, the total length would be 19,800 li." The King of Persia was speechless with amazement! The total population of Persia is only six million.</p>
