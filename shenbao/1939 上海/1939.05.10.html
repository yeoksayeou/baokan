<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本與德義同盟</h3>
<p>前日評述演變中之國際情勢，固知醞釀動盪，曾無瞬息髯靜，而其影響宏遠，未可須臾漠視。顧又竊以爲至少在一週乃至半月之內，容許吾人暫安絨默，靜觀變化。詎意即此三日間，遽有不凡之現象，似乎示人以嶄新發展，將接踵而至焉。</p>
<p>此三日問：英國與土耳其之商訂協定，傳已確切成立，法國即將加入、此乃歐洲民治國軍事上極關重要之一圜。英蘇談判，前以蘇聯人民外交委員長李維諾夫氏去職而有頓挫之觀，前途似異常黯澹渺茫者，今已由英國駐莫斯科大使西資爵士與蘇聯新任外長莫洛托夫氏繼續開談；所談內容。雙方嚴守秘密。蘇聯方面允深沉不露憂喜之端倪，而英法方面則盛傳樂觀；我人旣無自而窺其實况，亦不必預卜其爲吉凶，然此乃性質異常重要之醞釀，一旦揭曉，必共見其爲今後國際情勢中之重要因素；鑒於蘇聯外長之所以更迭、與更迭後之即行續談，可以預告揭曉之期已不在遠。此二事者。日來之大事、顧非所謂不凡之現象。惟彼德義兩國之決定締結政治軍事同盟條的，以及與此相應而來之英國與日本兩國之外交活躍，則有促成國際情勢嶄新發展之可能，今其不凡之伏筆歟。</p>
<p>德義兩國締結政治軍事同盟條的，可作種種註解：一，反共公約之强化；二、反共口號之消滅；三，兩國往日貌合神離之反證；四，兩國勾結侵略之充實；五，兩國事實上早已同盟、而今以蛇足爲示威之具；六，知難而退，一籌莫展，以此爲掩護；七，倒行逆施，圖窮七見之最後挣扎，最後準備；八，以日本之態度游移，爰示日本以兩國意態之堅決强毅。凡此種種。涵義逈殊，因果不同，事在今茲，遽難斷言其究竟何屬。譬之公開同居之兩性，久共生涯矣，兒女成羣矣，忽又宣吿決定結婚；謂非新事實可。謂有新原因可。謂當然之手續，當然之結果。亦可；究何所爲，惟待爾後事實爲之說明而已。然其影響所及，　英國日本皆爲之怦然心動。英國因是發揮其一貫之外交作風；日本則故示矜待。以示其將侍價而沽焉、將擇人而事焉就英國言之：志切聯蘇、而於蘇日兩國間之矛盾與危機、則靳不予蘇以何種聲援，此一方面也。德義兩國關係之密切、已顯著至此階段。然英國滿望分化與綏靖之念、迄未完全捐棄。同時却又努力組織反侵略集團、以與之對抗、此一方面也，在中國之權益、備受剝削；在中國之淪陷區域內，有日本領導之排英行動；偶至重慶之大使，暢覽日本空軍之始終表演；日本國內之反英宣傳，反英運動，氣　逼灼；然而英倫外交當局却示意於駐英之日本使節，旣贊美日本之不爲德義軍事同盟所誘，復「坦白」吿以英蘇談判之內容，亦即英國拒不接受蘇聯關於遠東之建議議，即彼英國之報紙、亦於英日接近之可能，隱的其辭，謂　國當局夙有此願望焉，謂日本行動漸有其傾嚮焉；此又一方面也。每一方面，皆可表見英國外交之玲瓏剔透，夫針對國際環境而善謀其國是，我人髯稱譽英國外交之作風，然國際大局所受影響於英國作風之外交者。豈淺鮮哉！當年歐洲大戰之初、以及九一八事變之後，若英國外交而能剛健，則德國戰敗未必若之慘。日本自陷未必若是之深：而與德日周旋者之犧牲亦必不若是之衆也。</p>
<p>就日本言之：對於德義之軍事同盟，雖迭作拒不參加之非正式表示。其實至今仍爲患得患失，半推半就；彼主觀之操縱自如、與客觀之首鼠兩端，亦恰成「五十五十」之分際。蓋日本國內持重者與躁進者至少對於德義關係問題無法融和。此何以故？謂爲觀點不同，見解不同，願望不同，母寗謂爲各無自信與各無把握而已。惟不自信與無把握，故滿望在國際有所結託。結託有利有害有能有不能，而正反兩面皆非操之在己。試觀大使重光，趨蹌於哈利法克斯之門；大使大島，奔走於里賓特洛浦與齊亞諾之間；其陸相板桓，謂日本未嘗不可加入德義軍事同盟；拓相小磯，謂有待德義了解日本；而其外務省發言人，則無一辭以答復新聞記者之詢問。形形色色，謂日本亦有其旣定之國策，徒爲他人所莫測其高深歟？蓋必不然也。雖然，有可爲彼國策作一賅括之說明者，即彼所謂反共產，或所謂不反民治，或所謂不在全能國之列，或謂親英美，或謂親德義，甚或謂應親蘇聯，舉與理智情感信仰無關；要知日本在華苦戰廿餘月，絕無自拔方法，豈復能好整以暇，談所謂親疎恩怨。有所謂贊成反對；彼當前之惟一問題，惟一國策，即在尋求如何始能有利於彼之對華。謂對德義，乃至對英對蘇。要無不以彼所謂對華問題爲之中心。挾德義以要英國，要英國以疎蘇聯，豈問鼎歐洲之謂哉！</p>

<h3>軍事同盟問題　日採超然態度　德義擬施壓迫使日就範　三國政府談判正在進行中</h3>
<p>此間德國人士頃宣稱日本對於軸心各國態度、自德國方面視之、實覺過於超然、德義兩國茲已決定訂立政治軍事條的、當可以影響加諸日本、促其改變初衷、關於此層、德義日三國政府正在進行談判中、德義兩國之意、乃欲日本在軍事上接受的束、截至目前爲止、該國始終不願過問歐洲事件、且以德義兩國幷未訂有軍事同盟條的爲口實、不欲以反共產國際公的改爲同盟條的、茲德義兩國旣已訂立政治軍事條的、德國自可利用此種機會、勸吿日本變更原來態度云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間外交界人士咸以日本對於德義軸心態度如何爲問、並謂德義兩國外長日前在米蘭城進行談話時、日本並無代表參加、未知是吾變更態度、抑或哲時觀望云、據可靠消息、日本雖與德義兩國簽有反共產國際公的、但仍在某種程度之內、保持行動自由、其拒不與各該國簽訂軍事同盟條的也、蓋不欲接受的束、因而迫令英國與蘇聯訂立同盟條的、幷迫令美國更與西歐各國相接近、德義兩國聞曾堅勸日本、謂英蘇兩國若果不問日本意向如何、仍復成立同盟條的、則日本即常毅然決然與德義兩國簽訂軍事盟的、日本方面聞會答稱、此種情事他日若果發生、日本態度如何、未便事先予以揭露云、言外之意、對於參加德義軍事盟的之議、或不堅持異議、特自此際以達彼時、仍當以保留態度處之、關於此層、倫敦方面德國人士雖云德日兩國政府正在賡續接觸、日本與德義軸心實有進一步相接近之可能、但英國方面仍望日本能在某種桯度之內審愼將事、此於該國飛機近日轟炸重慶後、英駐日大使克萊琪雖向日本外務决官堀內發出表示、謂英國政府當認此事爲嚴重案件、却父不提出正式抗議、可見一斑、但此間外交界人士則謂、英政府當在日內依據「人道觀念」提出正式抗議、日方不論援引何種口實、均不足以辯護此種鹵莽滅裂之空襲云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（重慶）　重慶聯合日報由本地十家報館聯合發行者、今日載一社論、評論德義軍事盟的並陳說日本未加入盟的之意義、謂此盟的之成立、並非出於意外、旣不足增加軸心之威力、且反削弱德義日防共公的之地位、日本之未加入軍事同盟、非因德義有檳棄日本之意、但因日本有恐被牽入歐戰之心、日本因在華作戰之故、乃不得不在國際事件中改採消極行動云、（九日路透電）</p>

<h3>昨日五九國恥　各界沉痛紀念　擁護國策堅持到底　以達雪恥復興目的</h3>
<p>昨日為五九國恥第一十五周年紀念日、本市各界茹素一天并停止娛樂宴會、沉痛紀念、各界擁護國策、堅持到底、以達雪恥復興目的、往年此日、各界均懸掛半旗、以資紀念、惟本年因顧全環境困難、經各團體共同商定。暫不懸旗、并由有關係團體於先一日分途出發說明、但昨日各馬路商店、仍多自動懸掛半旗者、以此可見市民對於五九國恥紀念之深刻也、</p>
<h3>自動懸掛糾紛</h3>
<p>昨日自動懸掛旗者、有公共租界南京路浙江路芝　路石路福州路一帶商店、但　被捕房當局勸令卸去、迄至上午十時左右、偷雞橋之順發鞋店、因懸掛櫥上、當時被捕房所派之西捕勸令卸去、但不久該店複將國旗懸在高樓、又被西捕前往勸止、該店乃又將旗卸下、俟西捕去後、複將國旗懸在屋頂。西捕因其不聽勸告、當將店員過省事件被捕房拘去一店員、訊問一過後、即行釋放、但順發鞋店店員過省更激於義憤、於返店時、在日昇樓等處告人經過、致聽者雲集、並有路過人啟頓葆等亦同聲附和、當有該處之汪萃與錫箔舖登相繼打烊休業、未及一時、該路大小商店、均紛紛自動打烊、致一時情形、頗為嚴重、時捕房當局。亦已得訊、特派出警車及警員前往防衛維持秩序、爾路人愈集愈眾、形勢十分緊張、致交通亦告停頓、但不久經當局勸告後、即行恢復原狀、一場小糾紛、至此告終、</p>
<p>截止昨晚午夜、據悉老閘捕房內因懸旗糾紛爾被拘留者有二十二人、另有國旗二十五面、亦仍被扣在該捕房內、未曾發還、正在交涉中、</p>
<h3>米糧評價會　穩定米市辦法　辦理存米貨主登記限價出售　昨晨市場售出甚多情勢鬆動</h3>
<p>上海米糧評價委員會、昨日下午三時、集議商定米價、取締投機、議決屬行米糧限價、并擬訂購洋米、昨　市場有汕頭幫接受勸告、售出頭號白米、各幫秈米相率出籠、於是米價順勢穩定、茲分誌詳　於下、</p>
<p>再度集議　穩定米價</p>
<p>米糧評價委員會、為穩定米價取締投機起見、特於昨日下午三時、假漢口路綢業大廈四樓上海商社召開第三次委員會議、計到張念萱·陸文韶·周之楨·潘紀斌·黃如園·石祖福·朱兆圻·符前耕·朱子香·陳子彝·史鴻動·嚴際雲、公推陳子彝為臨時主席、首出出席報告開會宗旨、及米市　逾越限價量形、</p>
<p>議決結果　屬行限價</p>
<p>旋即開始討論、　限價案、議決、米市場交易、務須遵照本月五日米業團體聯席會議規定限價、如有超越情事、應出市場管理委員會、依照規則、嚴屬執行、　辦理存米貨主登記案、議決、制定表格令報公告、公佈市場、并通告各米業團體、轉知所屬同業、凡存米貨主務須於規定期限內、至此米行業公會填表登記、以憑核辦、否則當陳報租界當日處理之、　擬請第三者參加本委員會案、議決、函請兩租界當局及市商會派員參加、　資遵循、　擬請兩租界當局採購米糧案、議決、具體意見、函請設法向各　採購米糧來　儲備、以資壓平市價、</p>
<p>未雨綢繆　商購洋米</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨日向各米業領袖探悉、據云、本市存糧、據調查尚有五十六萬餘包、惟各米號門市部亦有三十餘萬包、合計全市存糧約有八十餘萬包、第目前各產地雖有源源運到、每日約二三十千包、惟本市各米業團體。為未雨綢繆計、曾經一度商討於必要時、決商得兩租界當局同意、訂購巨量洋米、運滬接濟、以維民食、況目前限價與洋米售價相等、屆時可無任何困難、此項問題、現已由各米業團體分別研究、俟彙彙意見、即陳報租界當局及市　會、共同討論、</p>
<p>人心安定　遵守辦法</p>
<p>目前因米市場逾越限價、大戶扒進囤積、一度產生紊亂狀態、雖經米市場全體委員會分別勸告、收效仍售、各大戶并存觀察態度、全市市民因盧及此、心懷忐忑、及向各米糧門市部、　量購藏、以防不測、以致較小米號竟大半售出、雖經各米號員工竭力勸告、勿以自相驚騷、卒無效果、茲因米市場已趨穩定、大戶已出售、故人心已趨安定、并聞米號業方面。決遵守議訂辦法、并由各委員會分別督促各米號店主、極力應付目前環境、以全大局、爾小私我、</p>
<p>囤戶出售　市場穩定</p>
<p>豆米業市場管理委員會、竭力勸告各行號及客幫、顧全大局、切勿投機操縱後、昨晨市場上、有汕頭幫通安詳記等、將上次採辦預備運汕之頭號常熟白米三千包、向市上售出、維持米價、惟規定每一買戶至多不得超過二十包、由市場委員會分配給各米號應市、價格為十五元、傭金另加、至於客秈亦有巨量售出。於是市場價格、已趨穩定</p>
<p>日商辦米　旨在圖利</p>
<p>日方企圖統制其佔領區域之米、因產米之鄉鎮均由遊擊隊控制、以致是項統制計劃、終難實現、惟國米之由產地運滬、除繳納苛稅雜場外、并時有發生瞭礙、此外如燕湖停發米糧擬出證、常熟·無錫、限制國米出售　、　　　　　·　　　　行、向產地巨量採辦、運至廣州華北各地銷售、</p>
<p>報告經過　疏通來源</p>
<p>豆米市場管理委員主任委員符前耕、將於今晨向各幫販運客商報告第三次評價委員會議經過、及勸導極力疏通來源、盡量採購、以免滬市民食發生恐慌、至於評價委員會方面、擬於今日繕發佈告、通知各存米店主將所有村米、即日起向豆米業會登記、并將致函兩租界</p>

<h3>轟炸外國產業　日方橋辯諱飾　諉稱飛機高度難辨標記　對外產並未作主力轟炸</h3>
<p>字林報云、日方昨日（八日）招待各報記者時、某記者詢、重慶近遭空襲、須在何種情况下、日當局始允負轟炸外國產業之責任、海軍發言人答、如屬錯誤、或不愼之轟炸、日軍願負其責仟、該記者又詢、日當局願負故意轟炸之責任乎、發言人答、日本陸海軍從不故意</p>
<p>轟炸外產</p>
<p>日方調查炸及外國產業事、絕無故意轟炸之例證、或詢、除潘南　兵艦與其他相類之不幸事件以外、其他亦有外國產業被炸、而日方已願負責者乎、發言人答、據渠所憶、最近並無此種事件、曾有數次、外國產業被炸、而被稱爲故意出此者、參加空襲之駕駛員已加吾認、此等意見上之差別、已經</p>
<p>外交談判</p>
<p>解決之、有詢日方在此種談判中、是吾抱駕駛員必無錯誤之熊度、發言人答、日方接得被炸及者所發不平之言、概加調查、並答覆有關領事、自投彈之高度中、甚難辨別外國標記、而於垂直飛行時、殆亦不能區別、各外國領事署供給之地圖、均複印而分發各投彈之飛行人員、彼等於空襲前、詳細查閱</p>

<p>內表明各外國產業之地位、但設於此等外國建築物附近之華方高射砲隊、未列入地圖、至轟擊高射砲陣地時、由於地位臨近、或將發生不幸事件、某記者稱、渠蒐集已往日方言論　得印象、卽實際上日方不允負轟炸外國產業之責任是、又詢據　所得印象、</p>
<p>華方砲隊</p>
<p>常離外國產業一二哩之遙、則外國產業遭摧毀、是吾可歸咎於臨近砲隊、發言人答稱、如華方高射砲隊遠離外國產業、則不能有所藉口、但渠以為砲隊不致距離若是遙遠、又稱、日機飛臨重慶天空、未</p>
<p>分散隊形</p>
<p>某記者即詢、此言何能與日機一分隊轉襲華方砲隊之說相脗合乎、發言人答、每一分隊保持自己之隊形、就一般而言、均不分散隊形、日機並未向重慶外國產業被彈擊中之區、作主力之轟擊、發言人旋復引述日譯國際法中一語、謂不能認爲重慶可免轟炸，</p>
<h3>工部局工務處　維持良好路政　界內分為兩區專責管理　重要道路均改舖三和土　不因交通擁擠材料昂貴而停頓</h3>
<p>字林報云、自軍興以來、公共租界情况反常、如車輛之增加、與建築材料之昂貴等、均爲工部局工務處道路科目前所遇之難題、交通之擁擠、使公共租界與界外馬路、不得不大事修理、西區若干道路之狀况、允爲惡劣、有時難加修理、至能、興工時、常因材料缺少而延遲、目前</p>
<p>材料雖昂</p>
<p>但工務處仍能從事工作、而盡可能補救此種局勢、爲管理並視察道路起見、公共租界分成兩區、其一爲虞洽卿路以西、包括西區在內、由兩工程師管理虞洽卿路以東以北、均包括於東區內、由常川視察員等不時四出視察、如有路面損　、立即報吿工程師調查、估計</p>
<p>修理費用</p>
<p>呈報工務處總巡、一俟核准、即開始動工修理、虞洽卿路西側自南京路至跑馬廳、業已改建、目前愛文義路與康腦脫路、正在修理中、福州路與北京路頗多損壊、一部份在重建中、憶定盤路與惇信路間之大西路、亦已改造成三十呎闊之三和土路面、俾勝任</p>
<p>雙層汽車</p>
<p>之行駛、西藏路橋以南之虞洽卿路東側、因行駛手推車而損壊甚重、今亦在重建中、其他不久將興工者、有威海衛路之數段道路、如西摩路以東之灣曲處、將開拓至四十呎闊重慶路附近將放闊十八呎、慕爾嗚路附近將放寬十一呎、均將</p>
<p>舖三和土</p>
<p>路面、此等道路之交通、旣不致减少、舊時之瀝靑路面移去後、即改建三和土、故公共租界之大多數道路、卒將全用三和土爲路面也、公共租界道路之損壊、大半爲行駛鐵輪手推車所致、而於夏季中損壊允甚、蓋手推車一經停留、其鐵輪即陷入路面之　　中、車輪過處、</p>
<p>必留一痕</p>
<p>復由其後之手推車駛過、逐漸加深、不久即須修理、决爲載重卡車、蓋住宅區道路上之瀝靑、僅可供輕便交通、往時山船隻運來之食物、今由西區道路上運入、結果必須大加修理、而以三和土代瀝靑路面、故舊式之手推車與「新式」之載重卡車兩者、似爲保持公共租界道路於良好狀態之主要困難、</p>

<h3>林康侯之訪問</h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>他興學救國的心，是從變法而來，但是他所學的，自然免不了是（子曰）（詩云），於是他欣然往日本考察教育。回來擔任龍門師範教習，但它仍以爲小學是國民敎育的基礎，要　法必先要普及國民教育，應該辦理小學。他看到德國和日本的富强，惟一的原動力，是國民敎育普及，因這緣故他就一方面鼓吹他的主張，一方面一主持徐家滙南洋公學（即今日交通大學）的附屬小學，貫澈他的主張。</p>
<p>淸光宣叫贖路運動，瀰滿全國，鐵路民營，風起雲湧。川漢粵漢，雖集款未築，而蘇路浙路（即今之滬杭路）相繼自造，當時蘇路開車當局，決定車務總管不用外國人，可是多方物色，終找不到相當人材，有人想到林先生了。</p>
<p>當局派人去請沓往充蘇路的軍務總管了，他知道他們的來意後，就笑嘻嘻地說，造屋請箍桶匠，已是笑話，管軍請敎書匠，更屬滑稽，我是決心辦小學敎育的，更希望終身辦敎育事業。</p>
<p>那數位敦請的人，經過了數决往返，林先生是富有同情的人，拗不過他們的蘇張辭令，實行他所服膺曾子爲人謀而忠與朋友交而信的道理，決心不辭勞怨，以敎書匠而去做車務總管，未幾蘇浙兩路收歸國有，改爲滬杭甬路，林先生遂避車務總管職而退休。</p>
<p>北平新華儲蓄銀行開辦，當局想起林先生是勤苦耐勞的人而且是能一學即致用用覺不足即學」，於是增加他們敦促林先生前往仟職的決心。他到了新華銀行，竟像一個老銀行家。新華銀行當局以上海實爲中國的經濟中心，乃請他祖任上海分行經理。後來上海新華銀行分行辦得很爲社會所信仰，都是林氏之力。</p>
<p>民國十六年春季，革命軍臨滬，上海政治分會設改組上海總商會委員會，林先生亦被委爲委員，並被推爲主席委員之一，改組就緒，又正式被舉爲主席，其間對於整理商會中事件，多所擘劃，惟以服務社會責軍事繁，遂辭去了銀行職務。</p>
<p>上海銀行公會以林先生熟悉銀行業務，待人接物，都尙和藹，且知道林先生常以串錢人自比，說人都係眞珠，有大有小，有光有黯，倘使零亂置在盤中，看不出優美，倘排列整齊，用綫串了，就覺得粒粒可愛，顆顆得宜，倘使人和人間，也有精神上適當的聯貫，就可表現出親愛精誠。恩怨旣無，自然通力合作，所以遂請林先生視任該會的秘書長。</p>
<p>民國十七年，上海弟一特區工部局加入中國董事及委員，林先生任敎育及工務委員，繼以認爲敎育　加重耍，遂專任敎育。他所兼工商業公司董事長董事或監察甚多，而合夥經營的事業也不少，不過爲成人之美，而參加的居多。</p>
<p>民國二十一年「一二八一的時候，孫哲生先生長行政院，他任財政部常務决長，旋即改任政務决長，時間雖祇一個月，而於財政方面的應興應革，確已全豹窺及。但林先生認爲做官不是享福的，是吃苦的，仍舊保持他的平生志趣，不引舉一個人，都婉言對討差的說，我不可害你們。民國二十五年林先生被推爲暹邏考察團團長，率領團員數十人，前赴暹羅。暹維是熱帶地方，林先生不辭勞瘁，對於慰撫僑民，聯絡邦交等等的工作，盡量的努力。這决在中暹邦交上得了很大的收穫，至今在暹維的華僑，還深印着一位和藹可親的林先生呢。</p>
<p>去年，他又被推爲第二十四屆國際勞工大會中國雇主代表，及世界紅十字會第十六屆大會中國代表，他奉了國民政府委任以後，他居然老當益壯毫不遲疑的就道出國。他在兩次大會閉幕以後，薄遊歐美，爲時六閱月，行路二十萬里？經地數十國，作記十萬言。他回國的時候，他的精神比出國時更覺飽滿了。</p>
<p>經過了長時間的談話，因爲催他去出席會議的人頻頻來請，於是我就向林氏道謝握別。（完）</p>
<h3>在胡特島擱淺　看日輪遭浪擊沉　船員五六十人均獲救　輪下沉將已裂成兩截</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日本郵船會社之五三七四噸拖輪馬立加丸、上星期五日晚濃霧中、在距上海的一百三十哩之胡特島（譯音）擱淺後、爲巨浪擊斷、沉入海底、全部喪失、最先答覆該輪所發遇險呼號者、爲普勒托（譯音）號　長　埃加、鼓輪駛往馬立加丸</p>
<p>危險地點</p>
<p>於五月六日晨十時三十分瞥見該破輪、乃在附近停下、準備援助馬立加丸之輪員、彼等似已　其輪、而乘救生町向普勒托輪行駛、時突有日方第一暨第四號驅逐艦兩艘、駛抵該地、特埃加輪長乃將援救工作、交日艦辦理、而自行</p>
<p>首途前駛</p>
<p>時馬立加丸仍擱淺島上、但遭巨浪猛擊似將下沉無疑、此間日本郵船會社人員接訊、即僱拖輪卡洛林馬勒號、駛往遇險地點企圖進行援救工作、馬勒輪駛抵該島時、馬立加丸仍</p>
<p>擱淺岸上</p>
<p>損壊頗重、但日本驅逐艦兩艘已無蹤跡、馬立加丸全部輪員仍回登本輪上、彼等見馬勒輪駛抵、復棄輪登救生艇、駛近馬勒輪、一行五六十人、乃登拖輪脫險、此援救之拖輪停泊其旁時、馬立加丸裂成兩截、於衆人旁觀之際、漸漸下沉、</p>
<p>工商業戰時規定損失與　戰時會計決算辦法　許冠羣氏主張應由各業自決　貝祖翼氏認為此非法律問題</p>
<p>自奚玉書會計師呈請經濟部、請將工商業戰時規定損失、列作遞延資產、經部批尙可照准等語、批復以來、頗引起工商界之密切注意、嗣據潘序倫會計師之意見、以爲此項戰事損失、純屬耗損性質、一無資產作用、應由資本項下扣减、免致虛計盈　高估資產、且如列作資產、有反公司規定之嫌、於是衆說紛紜莫衷一是、而工商界之決算、　有　定繩準之槪、茲錄許冠羣。貝祖翼兩君意見如下、</p>
<p>許氏意見</p>
<p>此决工商界之受有巨額損失者、指不勝屈、奚會計師爲保護我國工商界起見、乃呈請經　部將此項損失、列作遞延資產、用意極爲可感、嗣蒙部批、尙可照准、並允分十年攤提處理、　在年度決算，如將戰事損失、列作遞延資產、似屬不無依據、且既可分年攤提、即屬資產性質、而潘會計師所論根據會計原理，及現行公司法，亦屬確論、總之、在非常時期、當有非常辦法、本人以為奚會計師既有部批根據、則在非常時期、工高界決算　爲準繩、當無不合、而潘會計師所論、均本法理、工商界決算據此、亦無不可且在事實上、各業之決算、超出上述二途以外者、亦屬有之即以本人所經營之藥廠而言、對於戰事損失、另提準備科目處理、因營業之特性旣各互異、決算之結果亦復不同、其處理之辦法極難一致、如經濟財政兩部爲體恤商艱起見、應准各業各就其便利爲決算處理之決定，則工業復興、前途深資和賴矣、</p>
<p>貝氏意見</p>
<p>會計上對於特殊損失、可有三種處理、（一）由本期收益負担之、（二）由以後各期收益負祖之（三）直接自資本中减　之、戰事損失旣非本期收益所能負担、亦不便直接自資本中减除、故不妨暫列爲資產、俾可按期攤補、戰事損失列爲遞延資產爲一會計上處理問題、非一法律問題、苟一公司所遭受戰事損失、巳逾資本總額三分之一以上、或其財產顯有不足抵償其債務時、儘可由董事監察人等召開股東大會討論應付辦法或向法院聲請宣吿破產、惟公司雖遭巨額損失、而其收益能力仍然　佳其盈餘不僅足以補償損失間亦有剩餘者、倘依法使之結束、在國民經濟政府稅源上着想、均非得計、在債權人觀點言之、亦不願促使企業結束、俾免「與汝偕亡」之患故在可能範圍內、必須維護企業之生存也</p>

<h3>業餘之科學</h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>一般人士以為科學在各學術中最為博大精深，非在學校肄習，有良師為之指導，絕不易窺其門徑。此種觀念未免錯誤、其實科學為人人所能習，與各種學術初無少異，要在學之者之得其方，且有毅力恒心以赴之耳。歐美人士多於有職業餘暇之時研究科學，以為消遣，爾歷久不懈，竟能有偉大之造就者，如英國洛保克氏（Lubbock）即是一例。洛氏初在銀行任事，旋充國會議員，終其身為嘗脫離金融及政治之生活，夙夜從公，忙碌之至·然茍有片刻之暇，必藉科學工作以自娛。其研究之範圍亦甚廣：如地質學·考古學·植物學·動物學·人類學·社會學·無不悉心探討，貢獻甚富。而其最精者則為顯微解剖學，下等甲殼類之分類，與種種昆蟲本能之實驗等等。成績之優良，視專門名家毫無所遜。達爾文嘗歎美之曰：「吾真不識君從何得充分時間爾成此貢獻也」。又如七十餘年錢英國駐華領事孫何氏（Swinhoe），曾在鎮江·寧波·汕頭等處任職、公餘之暇，則研求中國之哺乳類，時時發見新種；英國倫敦動物學會彙報多載共論文。此人遂以中國哺乳類學之權威著名，至今世界專家猶多稱道之。海關職員勒圖施氏（La　Tonche）於公務之暇，專喜研究中國之鳥類，孜孜不倦，除發表多種之報告外，最後著成中國鳥類專書，在世界鳥類學中膾炙人口。此皆善用業餘之時間，從事於高尚之嗜好，促學術之進步，增長人類之之時，卒能成名不朽者。吾國社會以麻將·戲園duane跳舞消遣者，斷喪健康，斷送金錢，殊屬不值。望借鑒於茲，爾急圖振拔也。</p>
<h3>水的清潔法</h3>
<p>— 澤南</p>
<p>地球表面，水占百分之七十，我們每天吃的用的，都離不了水，就是在人類身體裏面，也含有百分之七十的水，可見水對於人生是何等的重要了。</p>
<p>水雖然這樣的多，可是我們很不容易得到一些純粹的水·海水，大家都知道是含有鹽質的，河水和井水也含有礦質和其他雜質，即使是雨水，當他再空中降落的時候，也帶下不少的塵埃和細菌。所以我們收到天然水之後，必須先經過種種方法，使他清潔，方始能夠應用。使水清潔的方法很多，現在就他餓用途大略來說一說。</p>
<p>A科學上及工業上用水在實驗室或工廠內，有時需要比較純粹的水，尤其是含有礦質的水，能損壞鍋爐和使實驗不真確，必須先把礦質除去。普通都用蒸餾法，就是先把水蒸發成汽，使水中的雜質都留在器中，然後把汽通入冷凝器使他還原成水。這種方法所得的水最為純粹，不過製取困難，費用很大。</p>
<p>B家庭用水　家庭內所用的水，也須相當清潔，尤應殺死水中的細菌，使適合作飲料之用。最普通的殺菌法，就是把水煮沸，這時全部細菌都不能生存·煮沸的水，雖然仍含有礦質，但對於人類的健康，大概是有益無害的。有時我們把水通過幾層砂粒和炭屑，可以除去大部份雜質和一部份的細菌，這就是普通所謂沙濾法。</p>
<p>C城市用水　現代大都市中，幾百萬居民都仰給於自來水。所以自來水的清潔與否，關係居民的健康問題更大。但大量的水不能用蒸餾法或煮沸法來消毒。惟有採用下列的幾個步驟：</p>
<p>一將明礬加入水中，使起化學作用，成三氫氧化鋁的膠狀浮懸物，漸漸把水中的雜質和細菌及色數登一起結合爾沉澱。家庭里大都用此法。</p>
<p>二把上項處理過的水在砂唇中濾過，普通均用濾水池：鋪以幾唇細砂和粗砂，也有用機械方法·使水很速濾過·水中雜質一部分被沙濾去，一部分被積在池面的膠狀物所分解。若不經過第一步手續，使水在池中徐徐濾過，效力比較微薄。</p>
<p>三最後把氯或臭氧通入水中，藉新生機氧來殺菌，這時格外小心的方法，可以得到十分清潔的水。</p>
<p>使水化軟法：即將硬水中所含鈣或鎂的硫酸鹽，氯化物登除去，可在水中加入化學藥品——如碳酸鈉，氫氧化鈣，和砂鋁酸鈉登，使這種礦質自行析出。軟水可以節省肥皂，兼防止盛水器的損壞，這種方法雖然不屬於使水清潔的範圍，但因對於工業及家庭用水關係很大，故也約略述及。</p>
<h3>隱藏無線電機　密報盜警</h3>
<p>— 茸黎</p>
<p>强盜往往威脅事主，使兩手舉起，不得動彈，然後從容搜刮財物。事主祗有任共所為，莫可奈何。現在芝加哥有一位發明家創一組無線電器，事主兩手雖舉起，仍舊可以憑它發出警報·該器完全隱蔽於胸部衣內。遇盜時只需行一次呼吸，使胸部膨脹，然後圖著胸部的帶緊壓開關，使電路接通，一個自動的小發送機立即發出警報，達到中央接收機關。該電器據說專為銀行職員，送款老司務和守夜巡警而設計的。</p>
<h3>多胞胎的話（二）</h3>
<p>— 劉漢士</p>
<p>在本刊第十二期上，我們已經討論國一些多細胞的例子，和他們的成因及生物學上的解釋。現在我們得再進一步作統計學觀察和遺傳學的推究。</p>
<p>據專家研究，女子在三十五歲至四十歲之間，最容易生產多細胞，因為這時期正是女子生產力最盛旺的時期。又據德國赫林博士（Dr．Helin）統計研究的結果，在每八十胎的生產中，就有一胎使雙胞胎；八十的平方（等於六四〇〇）胎中，有一胎使三胞胎；八十的立方（等於五一二〇〇〇）胎中，有一胎使四胞胎；八十的四乘方（等於四〇九六〇〇〇〇）胎中，有一胎生五胞胎的可能性。這個公式現在為一般人所公認。</p>
<p>可是美國哥羅拉多大學，葛怡理希教授（Prof．W．W．Grenlieh）却不贊成赫林博士的計算法。他根據他自己研究一萬萬胎生產的記錄，創出一個不同的公式。按照他的說法，每八十七胎中方有一胎使雙胞胎；八十七的平方（等於七五六九）胎中，有一胎使三胞胎；八十七的立方（等於六五八五〇三）胎中，有一胎是四胞胎；同理，八十七的四乘方（等於五七二八六七六一）胎中，有一胎是五胞胎。現在我們且用算式來表明赫葛二氏計算法的差異：</p>
<p>由上表看來，赫葛二氏的計算法，起初雖相差不多，可是到後來愈差愈大，到四次方時，竟相差一千六百三十二萬六千七百六十一胎之巨。換句話說，加拿大狄家的五胞胎，照赫氏算法只要四千零九十六萬胎就可生產一次，但是照葛氏的算法，就要五千七百二十八萬六千七百六十一胎中方有一胎生產五胞胎的可能性。以這樣稀少的機會，當然狄家的五千金是可貴了，加上又是同性胎，有遺傳學上研究的價值，更加難能，同時五個囡囡都養活著，無怪要驚動全世界了。</p>
<p>照遺傳學上說，多胞胎使有血緣遺傳關係的。據調查結果，前述生了一胎二女一男的秉夫人之家庭中，曾有一兄和一妹都生產過雙胞胎。生了一胎四女的柏夫人，也是來自一個生過雙胞胎的家庭。至於生五胞胎的狄夫人，她得娘家也曾有過雙胞胎。這些都是有用的記錄，可作研究人類遺傳的好材料。讀者諸君，如有機會遇見雙胞胎，三胞胎，最好五胞胎，也可以訪問訪問他們的家庭，以前是否有人生過多胞胎。以我的預測，是一定有過的。還有一點，如果讀者發現某家生了四胞胎或五胞胎，也可照外國的先例，呈報中央政府，請領獎金，我想當此抗戰高潮需人孔丞，多生產值得獎勵的時候，政府是一定願意出一筆重大的獎金的。</p>
<h3>植物為何要稀疏</h3>
<p>— 泰民</p>
<p>誰都知道棉花或玉蜀黍如果種得太密，收成未必好。同樣的情形，數目在過擠的境遇中，生長很慢·要促進它們生長，必須和棉花或玉蜀黍一樣加以稀疏的工作。</p>
<p>附圖表示一棵松樹的斷面。此樹早先生長在過密的狀態中，它的直徑在二十九年內只長到五時牛。但把所在的樹林稀疏之後，它的直徑在十五年內竟增加七時，換句話說，即使生長的速度為未稀疏以前的二倍半。</p>
<p>科學聊齋</p>
<h3>追鬼</h3>
<p>— 禾山</p>
<p>某處農人養馬，積芻甚多，場中側近　葬處，夜間時聞慘號之聲，居民大恐，以為鬼哭。日暮即無人敢經其地，甚至居處附近者皆相率爾他遷。有某翁者，但素壯，適暮歸經過該處，忽聞其聲，由芻堆中　，即不畏懼，且慾窮其異，以為昏夜追鬼，亦一豪舉，乃攜手中燈及尾追隨，旋入　　之間，爾窮追不已。忽燈光閃爍，瞥見一物如小犬，奔躍其前，遠視乃一草狐，爾尤鳴　不已，始恍然於所謂鬼哭者，毋乃即是·爾自此之後，鬼哭即不復作。乃求農人清理積芻，見其下果有地穴，其中遺棄羽毛碎骨甚多，即狐所夙居。眾人之疑懼一朝頓失，其窮素力求，以明真象，亦即研究科學之精神也。</p>
<h3>世界科學消息</h3>

<p>動物形態的人工改造</p>
<p>各種動物形態，世代相傳，總沒有特殊變化。現在科學家在想法要用人工把它們改變。美國施丹福大學都維得V．C．Twotty博士曾用精細的手術施於像石籠子的兩栖動物，結果產生幾個有胼肢的　螈和幾個頭眼位置迥異尋常的異種。他新近又把一個純棕色的　螈改變為一個有斑點的　螈。這時他對於科學界又是一個新貢獻。他的改造方法，系用一塊從有斑點的普通種上取出餓色素細胞，移植於四分之一時長的，純色種的胚胎上·他用　螈試驗，系因這種改造方法可以連續施於它們之故。他的方法現在僅施於動物，將來或許可以施於人體的色素和形態。</p>

<h3>性愛與精神愛　在夫婦生活上的價值</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>有人說夫婦之所以和好，實由於性情之相投，致能再精神方面融合為一，然而精神方面的和好，不過導雙方之愛情入於苟安之局，但欲維持永久，尚須在內慾方面雙方協調，這一點瞞不了明眼人，只要有犀利觀察力的男女，在他們每天日常的生活里，都可以體察到的，因此之故，一個早洩陰痿患者所感覺的痛苦，確非局外人所能想像得之。</p>
<p>一個生理成熟的少女，由於肉體不斷刺戟，故頗需要異性為之配偶，此時血液充盈，憧憬春情，雖然尚不知性生活為什麽一回事，但其生男育女之責任，大都很為明瞭，不過若嫁給一個愚昧的丈夫，則她所由肉欲中得到的歡樂，可說微乎其微，此時她得丈夫若身體健全，精力充足，那末立刻可把一個妻子引到無比的歡樂之境，使她恍然大悟，曉得結婚在人生史上自有此珍貴的價值，然後能使伉儷間的感情與日俱增，實現夫唱婦隨之幸福生活。</p>
<p>如若丈夫使一個淫亂男子，未婚前耽溺自　，貪色斷傷，致性機能衰弱，則妻子大感失望，芳心受創，足以減少她對你的愛好，如若長此下去，那家庭破裂的慘劇，遲早難免。</p>
<p>研究這種性生活的障礙，再沒有比醫生的機會更多了，所以特忠告患者，患此者厥唯積極施行性內分泌療法，方可使之徹底治愈。</p>
<p>對於頑强爾久遠的陰痿癥使其服用睾丸分泌製劑「補健康」，能夠顯出非常有效的效果，該劑見效迅速永久，能使頭腦明晰，體重日增，返老還童。余曾採用該劑以治療上述各癥，七年中從未遇失效病例，故該劑已被無數中西醫家所推崇，其女用「補健康」功能調經種子，為婦科聖藥。</p>
<h3>鎮咳治肺秘訣</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>不論中醫西醫，對咳嗽一癥。均屬難治之癥，故肺病之多，遠過任何傳染病，爾其死亡率，亦實覺驚人也。故一般人不可以為傷風咳嗽，使一小疾，爾不加治療，倘不幸爾由咳嗽的不治變為肺病，則患者亦不應悲觀，其實肺病亦非如一般醫家所說那樣可怕，只要攝生和醫治得法，其他並無神秘，依余經驗所得，「補肺拿爾」一藥，頗有鎮咳治肺之特效，不論病狀至二三期之吐血，服此已能絕對根治，然當在治愈時間，宜安靜切勿勞動，并多攝取富有滋養料之食品，則所患尤易治愈了，此謂肺病必愈之條件。</p>

<p>單想要靠了局部手術，及一般化學療法，透膜殺菌療法，爾不從實際著想，却欲求淋病得到根治，無異駕梯取月，永遠不會實現的。蓋從前淋病的單獨用這等療法，所以失敗的原因。根據了這種理由，所以也就無怪增加白血球增加療法Lencocytosentherape，能夠在許多庸俗療法中，以最新穎和最急進的姿態，與世人相見了。這確是空前絕後之事。增加白血球療法的原理，有如下述：</p>
<p>原來所謂白血球療法者，就是用蛋白體亢增人體白血球的數量，使它的撲滅血液內德淋菌作用加强，一方又用特製黃色素以消除尿道的炎癥。所以在急性淋時的一切疾患，便能很快的治好，爾慢性淋濁，也能夠因淋菌的根本消滅，爾獲到很迅速的全愈。這蛋白體黃色素合製劑早已被國際著名的大醫院專家實地試驗，證明這種淋病特效藥，是出人意表的。這特效藥的名稱，就是「克淋儂」，它會消滅數千萬的淋病患者的痛苦，爾重新恢復他們的健康。凡是急慢性淋得淋病，服他藥所哺育，或施用他種手術所不愈者，服用「克淋儂」，皆可保證在三五星期中完全解決，外用藥可用「抗淋水」，女子可外用「雪地陰道片」為坐藥，但可按圖與說明書在家自行治療，尤穩安無比。</p>
<h3>香艶書籍能啓發自瀆</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭霆</p>
<p>青年在春情發動時期，因體內荷爾蒙之作祟，凡意志薄弱者，頗易受淫書及香艶愛情小說之引誘，爾啓發自瀆之動機，促成發育不全，神經衰弱登癥的主要原因，又因觀閱淫書淫畫之後，腦中留有不良之現象，遂成幻想，終以爆發了遺精之癥，故凡在發育時期的青年，對荒唐淫污之小說書畫，極應避免，即使已受淫書之害爾爆發以上之癥象者，除極力攝生之外，更應求有效爾可靠之療法，亦無由不徹底根治者。</p>
<p>今有患者曹俊民，年十九歲，陝西人，（自訴）——本人於十六歲時，因友人送余艶情小說一部，朝夕閱看，甚至飲食不思，又受劣友引誘，乃范自瀆惡習，藉以自慰，三個月後，始有遺精發現，初祗有一月二三次，後漸次增加，一星期有一二次之多，此時方知自瀆之害，雖力戒亦絕然無效，求治云云（治愈經過）——乃令其攝生并戒絕自瀆，服「耐爾斯遺精片」以止遺精，再兼服睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以培補虧損，旋經二月之治療，健康漸次恢復。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<h3>失孕之丈夫及其妻</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>活潑而聰明的小孩，是夫婦兩性愛情之連鎖。人生如到相當年齡膝下猶虚，便發出人生有空虚的感覺。故凡有妨害生殖機能的病患，均須及早根本解决，免貽後悔。今以淋病而論，其不良之後果，往往有失孕之悲劇，使如膠似漆之愛情，亦因膝下蕭條而解體，良堪浩歎。而妻子更時蒙不白之寃。</p>
<p>關於因淋毒而致失孕之症狀雖多，然未有如淋毒性攝護腺炎之影響吾人生殖力之大者。良以攝護腺液，具有養活精子之要素，其在生殖的地位上，僅次於睪丸，亦可説與睪丸處於同等之地位。所以千萬不可忽視。因爲攝護腺如果一旦停止其分泌液之功作，即不能養活精子，又因攝護腺炎時瘢痕的收縮，腺管閉塞，故生殖力缺乏而致失孕。至於女子如果淋毒已延及輸卵管，則卵管發炎閉塞，自然不能受孕。故曾結婚之夫婦知己患淋毒者，必須同時治療，始能恢復生殖之本能。余從廿餘年之經騐，對於淋毒性攝護腺炎之根本治療，德國珜電療法功效最著，而內服藥中之「克淋儂」確可稱爲淋毒內服藥中之聖劑。緣「克淋儂」殺菌力，具有包圍淋毒病灶，吞噬淋菌之奇功。所以淋毒性攝護腺炎，及女子輸卵管炎，服用之後，短期中可以奏功。並有立刻恢復分泌機能，而因淋毒失孕之夫婦的苦悶，自可根本掃除之　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日每天送診二十號，每號僅取號五角</p>

<h3>絲茶　新繭行將上市之　上海繅絲業　分向游擊區設法收繭　江隂最為廠商所歡迎</h3>
<p>上海蠶絲業目前最迫切重要之問題，首推原料，查滬上絲廠，每年所消費之乾繭，照目前情形估計，須十五萬祖以上，本年自有所謂華中公司」竟欲禁止乾繭運滬，統制各鄉繭行，企圖獨佔之後，滬上各廠深爲憂慮，近日局勢稍見緩和，蓋除城鎭以外，四鄉繭行多爲游擊隊所控制，如「華中」正式下鄕收繭，必遭游擊隊之攻擊，故「華中」日僞集議之下，經決定將勢力範圍以外之繭行，暫行放棄，由華人名義下鄉收繭，運城後，再轉售華中一，一面揚言准許華人，餘繭商，自由設行收繭，不加阻止，於是餘繭商大見活躍，然所收之繭，聞須與華中」各半分派，有云可以運滬，有云絕對不能，謠言亦尙多。</p>
<p>滬上目下絲廠三十七家，如一旦眞無原料運滬，勢必被迫停工，各廠有鑒於斯，故公開集議，在此時期欲有一切實之答覆，則不能肯定，結果決定先行於游擊區內着手租行，至於出運問題，屆時再定，即看事行事之方針，四鄉深明大義之繭行主，因不願被「華中」利用，故大都拒絕合作，紛紛到滬與各廠簽訂租賃合同，廠方與行方通力合作，因環境關係，恐發生種種阻撓，故一切資任均由行主負全部責任，今以市上一般之包烘價格列下。。</p>
<p>（一）大包烘　自收繭起至上江輪止，一切軍警捐稅，出運費用，行員薪水，鈑食雜用，均由行主負責，每担乾繭包烘價格，的自三十五元起至四十元以上。</p>
<p>（二）行主僅負烘成乾繭及洪工方面之開支，行中雜用，飯食等，其餘問題，悉歸客方負責，每擔包烘價格的自二十元起至三十元以上。</p>
<p>大概江陰方面各行，最爲廠商所歡迎，因其靠近長江，出運較爲便利，故包烘價格之上落均須視目前環境而定，較之戰前，的漲三倍至四倍之多。</p>
<p>宜興方面，近因中日兩軍，酣戰方殷，對於收繭前途，殊無把握，恐危險　他處爲多也。（翔）</p>

<p>出口、十日麵粉出口、計二萬五千百包運天津、二千包運威海衛、一萬一千三百包運厦門、又是日尙有麩皮五百包運厦門、四百包運香港、</p>
<p>麥市昨爲五九國恥紀念之期、雜糧公會市塲、停市一天、按麥市自被洋麥傾銷以來、所受影響、殊爲匪淺、交易久寂、蓋各廠旣有洋麥應用、均不臨市取辦本麥、祗應酬門市送廠貨而已、目下新到江北等麥、因泥質太重、市價每見抑低、聞送廠高麥僅開六元五六角、而市塲喊盤、仍相差一二角云、</p>
<p>洋麥源源而來、前日怡和經理之開其成立號輪（譯音）、運來九萬二千零十一包、已誌前報茲有天祥洋行經理之Hestralia號、裝澳麥七千餘噸、已於八日抵滬、停靠浦東其昌棧、現正在起卸中、又悉該行代理之Queen　Vctoria號輪、亦裝澳麥八千餘噸、的明日（十一日）即可抵埠、又有保和洋行經理之Rlauduff及Rindebak兩輪、由澳洲裝儎鉅量麥子來申、的本月中旬內均可抵滬、確數容待續報、（祖）</p>

<h3>先發制人</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>德義軍事同盟，就要簽字了。這一事件的經過，影響，以及將來的結果，各外國通信社電傳得很詳細，中國各報也一定會有多多的評論，所以我這裏不準備談這些，只略說說我因這事而發生的一些感想。</p>
<p>我覺得德義，允其德，畢竟是長於競技的好手，她們懂得「先發制人，後發制於人「的道理。我們看，自從中歐洲多事以來，那一决的變動，不是她們獲得勝利的？她們獲得勝利的原因，固然很多，但是決斷得快，出手得迅疾，正如競技塲上的好手那樣，處處爭先，實在是重要原因之一。這决軍事同盟的吿成，雖說醞釀已久，現在也不過水到渠成，吿一段落，而返觀一樣再　喧傳，似乎也有即日見之實行的反侵略組織，或英法蘇同盟，到現在還在若即若離的境地，我們就不能不說，在這一個比較上，還是德義佔了先著。</p>
<p>佔先則我爲主，人爲客。。我可以以逸待勞，予取予求，人便不得不倉皇應付，入我彀中。中國自從有了「三思而後行」，至少「再思可矣」的人生哲學以來，社會上，甚至政府當局，歷來就以迂緩曲折，因循拖延爲能事。他們說是審愼，考慮，實際却大都是躱懶。比了西洋人的勇猛精進，差得很遠，所以事事落在他們的後面。西洋人甚至急於佔先，以致幹錯了事，也說，總比不幹而錯過機會好。他們實在是深得佔先的三味的，而德義更是他們的代表者。</p>
<p>中國自從抗戰以來，總算將這種壊習慣改過了，也走上了佔先的勝利之途。我們看：侵略中國者，最初並不想實行開戰，只想以威逼利誘，來達到她的目的。中國却毅然抵抗，使侵略者不得不悉索敝賦，勉力應付。一直到現在，還是保持着這個局面：侵略者要想保持旣得的利益，就此議和，而中國還是要抵抗到底，將侵略者逐出國土。中國爲主動，侵略者爲被動，情勢顯然，中國已佔了先。</p>
<p>佔先必勝，中國的確可以以此自信，雖然時間長久些，那又有什麽要緊！</p>
<h3>安眠藥</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>我在尙未動身之前，接到徐老師的信，呌我到林大夫那裏買一瓶安眠藥，從郵局寄去。徐老師好久不見了，聽說他在游擊區很活躍，身任要職，怎麽耍起安眠藥來？因此我特地繞道到他鎭上，登門拜訪，直接把這藥片送給他。</p>
<p>徐老師比從前更瘦了，精神却煥發。他見是我，連連拱手，哦哦哦的讓我進去，在抱經閣裏坐定。女僕捧上茶，我就掏出藥瓶來，雙手呈上，問起他爲什麽要這安眠藥。他把玩着那瓶上的裝璜，輕輕笑着說：『我失眠呵！』</p>
<p>窗外一個小小的院子，靠壁一叢綠竹，底下幾塊假山，我想起從前執經問字的時候，曾在這窗前消磨了不少歲月，東奔西走，一事無成，徐老師固老些，我也　　有髭了。他問起孤島上的生活，慨歎地說：『上海到底不是首陽山，薇蕨亦只是袋裏的錢，錢完了，就得給人擠下來。』</p>
<p>我就是給擠下來的人，聽了徐老師的話，心上說不出的難過。徐老師接着說：</p>
<p>『我在前綫危急，故鄉吃緊的時侯，曾經處分家事，立下遺囑，誓與鄉國共存亡，呌林大夫給我送來一瓶安眠藥，我自己寫上八句，呌：「士不可辱，心不可死。讀聖賢書，所爲何事！成仁取義，仰藥於此。天地神靈，實式憑之！」這件事朋友們全知道的。我下了決心履行誓言，聽得城裏國軍一退，就抓過瓶來，一傾而下。不料睡了半夜，些微睡意亦沒有，只聽得老妻匿笑的聲音。我心知出了意外，這玩笑可眞開得不小，敎人駡我欺世盜名，如何得了。我爬起來，向墻上一頭撞去，暈了，然而並不曾死。等到醒來，大家全圍住了我，勸的勸，說的說，我一聲不響，呆呆躺若。兒子說得較有理，他說；「沿江沿海城市的淪陷，是早就料到了的，不能和亡國相比。文文山輩孤忠耿耿，到了無可挽回，纔以一死報國。現在抗戰開始，萬不能和亡國相比。」他們守住了我，簡直沒有死法，後來兒子去內地參加抗戰，臨行向我跪着，請將他的出征，換取我的不死。這時候，我自己也就眞不想死，想睜開眼看看大軍反攻過來把强盜趕了出去的情景，嘆了一口氣，那些悠悠之口，怪我不死，只好不管了。肯翁就笑我是：「千古艱難惟一死，傷心豈獨息夫人，咳！</p>
<p>『心雖未死，辱却忍了。我們期待着的反攻，總不來。這暴跺眞是說不上來，左亦不是，右亦不是，望望日影，聽聽聲音，度日如年，坐立不安。等着等若，我的神經變了常態，往往失眠，形容枯槁，胃納不佳，眞恐要憔悴而死了。放翁詩：「王師北定中原日，家祭無忘吿乃翁，」將爲我而作了。老妻拿出安眠藥來，很有效。這眞可笑，他不曾殺我於當死之時，却又救我於偸生之日！</p>
<p>『現在我又變了。我曉得無論什麼事，自己做，不覺時間慢，袖了手等人，那纔心焦！與其守着等反攻，何若自己也來幹！自己認爲在當時已經死去，現在更生了。自己减去了四十歲，正當少壯，正好爲國出力。老弟！我現在不比你長，或者還比你年輕。我學會了開槍，我也會收發無錢電，我們已把這裏的侵略者趕走了，這兒現在是一片乾掙土。我現在很開心，精神上年輕了不少，不過晚上還是時時睡不着，非這藥不可。』</p>
<p>我聽着他說，時時舉起手，抹額上的汗，一聲不響的坐着。</p>
<p>他留我住了二天，我走的時侯，他親自送到輪船碼頭上，拉住我的手，丁寗說：</p>
<p>『你做不成夷齊，回去探望過雙親，還是回到這兒來，一定，我等你！』</p>
<p>他那過度興奮的臉，瘦得使人有些放不下心，我暗暗地祝禱這藥片能够永遠維持着他！</p>
<h3>五月的鮮花</h3>
<h3>誓</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>設想着獨步於桃源，或遨遊於海上；歸結茅屋在無人知曉之鄕，如隱逸之士般。這片遐想常使我徜徉於迷離的道路中良久</p>
<p>現實的鞭子却殘酷的從背後策過來，遂把我從夢幻中驚醒。抬起頭，我深自驚異。世界多遼闊？生活是什麽？人生是夢？</p>
<p>問號底銳利的彎鈎抓牢我的腦子，於是謹愼的尋找着答案。我開始學習，學習怎樣活下去。</p>
<p>朋友說；「我企求着一個變，你來拿起我的魔杖吧！」但，我又朝誰傾述呢？向人問伸出求助的手，誰願把我領上生活的大道呢？</p>
<p>活在別人的憐憫與同情裏不是可恥的嗎？我又躊躇了。抽回手，却邁起脚。我要仗着自己的力去走。眞理的路上決不會缺乏同道的伙伴，但我們不該畏縮着，向別人伸出蒼白的手。倦了，就倒下，算得了什麼？我們已獻出最後一口氣，爲了開路。一滴血，在歷史上便是一個痕跡。完整的一頁，是痕跡累成的。</p>
<p>撇棄掉朝後看的灰色鏡片吧！不要掂記着昨天。過逝掉的何必苦苦追悼，惋惜呢？幹麽老在昔日的庭院中徘徊，做一個留連光景的人？</p>
<p>我們要學習揚棄過去遺留下的醜惡的遺產，握緊今天，不要在一聲太息中放過每個黃昏。到明天，就是新的日子，有歡悅，有幸幸福，有太陽的日子是爲誓。</p>
<h3>無恥的文風—展卷有益錄—</h3>
<p>— 窮夫</p>
<p>爲侵略者頌揚功德，其實並不是容易的事，因爲往往連自己也會越說越糊塗。但是，我們一向的文人却有一種很好的本領，就是不管有沒有破綻，不管對不對勁，只給他一個捧，捧，捧。而事實上那些捧的話都只有一套，實在也沒有辦法可以顧到有沒有破綻和對不對勁。證明這種「文風」的歷史上的材料應該很多，不過我暫時找到的却是「平宋錄一。</p>
<p>一半宋錄」記兀朝丞相巴延牛定南宋的經過，是一部典型的拍馬著作。作者劉敏中，是被稱爲能文的人的。前面做序文的鄧錡，方回，杜道堅，周明四位，大概也都於「文辭」上很不錯。不過好在我並不想考定他們底身世，所以也不用冬說。但應該特別提出的是：他們都是漢人，把他們看作六百多年前的「××報」派的作家，是一點也不寃枉的。</p>
<p>鄧錡底序上說：我聖兀大丞相巴延公，：取襄淮如拾芥，平江南猶反手也。」又說：一吾聖天子以仁義將將，淮安王以仁義將兵：簞食壺漿，室家相　。</p>
<p>方回底序上說：「！…不以一兵一騎入城，不擄一民，不掠一物，所至皆然。」</p>
<p>杜道堅底序上說：「…用兵江漢，不嗜殺戮。城下之日，萬姓謐然。」</p>
<p>周明底序上說：復提師取江淮數十州，直　蘇秀，所向風　，兵不血刃…」</p>
<p>這都說得很好聽　但是一讀本書，却又發、見了許多相反的記載，眞呌人覺得太離奇了：癸丑詰旦，遺人陽邏堡往諭宋之將士，宣布朝廷威德。宋將不降。夏貨且以戰艦數千餘艘列於大江之下，橫截江面，其勢堂堂，若不可近。甲寅，父遺人敷陳禍福於宋將，宋將答曰：「我輩累受大宋重恩，正當戮力，死圖報効，此其時也，安有叛逆歸降之理？備吾甲兵決之：今日我宋之天下，賭博孤注，輸贏在此一擲耳。」丞相遂指揮諸將進兵攻陽邏堡，竟日不克。…</p>
<p>宋兵大潰於江中，陽邏堡人心瓦解，宋兵數十萬衆，死傷者幾盡，流尸蔽江而下。…</p>
<p>丁巳，丞相率兵至於丁家洲。…己未，丞相指揮諸將，授以方略，夾於江岸樹砲弓弩等具，併力攻之…追殺數十餘里，江面流屍，水爲之赤。…</p>
<p>壬午，至　州。前進之兵相持不決。…丞相召諸將指授方略，令各備攻具，期於來日分道攻擊。又先遣人大呼城下：，城中不聽。癸未，又令諸掾吏書諭文射入城中：，又不聽。丞相親督帳前軍數千臨於南城，又多建火砲及弓弩等具，日夜攻之不息。至甲申巳刻…克之，遂屠其城。原來如拾芥一和「猶反手」，纔是這里　不降一，那里「不聽」，這里，竟日不克一，那里「日夜攻之不息一。而所謂「不嗜殺戮」，「兵不血刃」，纔是這里「流尸蔽江而下」，那里　水爲之赤」。而一城下之日，萬姓謐然一，纔是「屠城」。這樣的情形，軍隊會文雅得沒有一個穿號衣的「老粗　和一匹馬跑進城裏，也不捉一名百姓，不搶一點東西，而民衆也會熱鬧得備茶備飯，家家互相道喜，眞是古怪之至了。</p>
<p>那麼，難道做序的人就簡直沒有細讀一下本書嗎？那又不是的。就是細讀了，也還得這樣寫。那理由，便是上面說過的，因爲捧的話只有這麽一套的綠故。作家到這時候其實也是可憐得很，算是自己用釘子把自己釘死了。</p>
<p>然而還有一個問題：本書旣以拍馬爲主旨，作者劉敏中何妨就寫大丞相不動一兵，不交一戰，便平定了南宋，豈不更乾脆得多嗎？但是也不成。因爲那樣一來，不但完全改了史實，會使人根本不相信你底賬，而且還會使書中的主人沒有了「功勳一，也沒有了　威武　。所以作家到這時候也是可憐得很，一樣是用釘子釘死了自己。</p>
<p>然而此其所以爲無恥的文風歟！</p>

<h3>猪仔慘酷生活之一斑</h3>
<p>（見遜淸同治十一年五月份本報）</p>
<p>澳門拐去猪仔，經陳司馬由東洋帶領回申，已於廿一日未刻到埠矣，計二百二十七名。牛也克輪船係泊於虹口萬昌碼頭，起岸之時，凡有閩廣商民，無不爭前觀看，自虹口至大橋數里之間，幾無一容足之隊。邑尊與各委員均親詣岸傍騐視彈壓，並稽點姓名籍簿，其所謂猪仔者，累累登岸，囚首垢面，瘡瘠徧體，膿痂汗穢，幾不可近。且每人身穿紫花布衣，共垢膩狼籍，亦竟與乞丐無無異；昨即用駁船，載往南門粥廠中安頓妥貼矣。今日各委員齊集，分訊數人，各自訴其被拐之事，及登舟後，逼迫虐待各種情形，有泣下沾襟者，有嗚咽不成認者。據謂：「由澳門至東洋途上，病而不起者四人，躍入水中尋死者三人，病而未死者三四十人。被笞者十一人，其中一人，於未笞之前，已患小病，醫生與船主言，此人有病，不可打也；而船主不聽，竟痛笞之，以致其人於十餘日後，始能復元。躍水者，亦未設法拯救，船仍開行。太陽酷熱時，悶在艙中，均不許出外云云。」</p>

<h3>現在是唯利是圖的時候麽？</h3>
<p>— 力克</p>
<p>這幾天，上海的中下階級的同胞們，當拿起飯碗來吃飯的時候，不得不要歟口氣，說聲「吃飯難」了！</p>
<p>「上海居」旣不易，而現在，「上海食」也跟着「上海居」來煎迫上海的中下階級的同胞們了！</p>
<p>照理，中國這决抗戰。爲的是求民族的獨立與生存，同時，又何嘗不是求人民生活的改善與向上呢？抗戰絕不是爲某一部分的人的，而是爲着全中國的每一個人的切身利益。因此，在這抗戰期中，每一個眞正愛國的同胞，就應該充分發揮出偉大的「同胞愛」來，不應該有着一絲一毫的「唯利是圖」的心理存在其間才好。</p>
<p>如果需要舉個例子。或是打個比喩，那末，這裏最好的例子最好的此喩莫如在驚風駭浪上的孤舟了。試問：在驚風駭浪上的孤舟中的每一個搭客，可不可以不互相帮助，互相愛護，而共同設法把孤舟救出於驚風駭浪的危險呢？如果在這生死存亡的關頭，還有人竟喪心病在的專門在別人身上轉「利」的念頭，這無異是害死了別人，同時是害死了自己</p>
<p>據近天報紙上登載關於米市塲的混亂，是一面由於囤戶的蓄意操縱，一面再加以大戶的鉅量扒進，以致陷全上海中下階級的同胞們於恐慌之中。現在雖經市塲管委會及評價委會，已密查存米貨主，呈報當局查辦投機操縱。但是這一可謂「可恥的事伴」，在這抗戰期中表現出來，實在是太羞辱了自己了。</p>
<p>在今天上海的環境正日漸惡化，各種惡勢力環伺着，正要尋覓一個機會，來向全上海的人民的精神上施以惡毒的進攻的時候，我們全上海的同胞們，不分階級，正應該和衷共濟地手拉着手，一點也不要露出空隙，徒給奸人以進攻的便利才好呢。</p>
<p>現在向自己同胞們的身上轉「利」的念頭，無異是不忠於國，破壊抗戰，吸吮自己同胞們的鮮血！在這裏，我不僅希望囤戶應該天良發現，切勿再事投機操縱。同時希望一切在抗戰時期中想借抗戰來「發財」的人民忠吿一句：現在不是「唯利是圓」的時候！</p>
<h3>慶餘里的拆屋潮</h3>
<p>— 飛雲</p>
<p>房主限十五號遷居　房客請求各方調解</p>
<p>自從上海　成「孤島」以後，租界簡直變成了「安樂高」，喫喝，享樂，把戰事丟得老遠；儘管生活程度一天一天增高，二房東趁火打刦，但是上海人照樣趾高氣揚地跑跳舞塲，電影院，和霓虹燈點得雪亮的大賭塲。</p>
<p>但長在這糜爛生活的背面，我們照樣可以看見許多英勇的鬥爭，看見了這些事實，我們才有點感喟地覺得，人性常常是兩面的，一面崇高無上，一面却是墮落無底！</p>
<p>比如這兩天，爲了拆屋重建的問題、，三千多房客，正展開了一幕代表上海房客與地主的鬥爭。這個鬥爭，看上去，只有一天一天擴大，而到現在止，這問題只有更加嚴重，更加尖銳。</p>
<p>我昨天特地到出事地點去作了一次訪問，地方是大家知道的，是新重慶路慶餘里，那裏一共有六條弄堂，房屋有一樓一底，二樓二底，三樓三底三種，因爲是舊房子，房價當然比時下房價便宜得多，也就因爲太便宜，慶餘里產主上海女子銀行，就壓迫慶餘里房客遷居。雖然房客曾經和女子銀行訴訟過，結果房客是敗訴了。</p>
<p>一走近新重慶路孟德蘭路口，就可以看見慶餘里門口的竹籬笆，這是多麽驚心動魄的東西呵！上海房屋翻迭之前，必須打籬笆，因此籬笆就等於一道哀的美教書。我在新重慶路上來回巡視了一下，看見沿馬路幾家商店，依然很鎭靜地繼續營業，表面好像倒看不出這裏將發生三千人流離失所的悲劇。</p>
<p>但是，我一走到裏面和朋友一談，才知道所有房客焦灼的情緒，是在一天一天加增，女子銀行强迫拆屋，剪綫，斷水的最後命令，馬上就可以下來，這個，對於住在慶餘里三千多房客，是一個多麽大的威脅呵！</p>
<p>我問我朋友，現在外面調解得怎樣了？</p>
<p>那朋友很氣憤的說二</p>
<p>「說是說十五號給回音，如若成功就是十五號，不成功，恐怕他們就得掀屋面，斷自來水，剪斷電綫！」</p>
<p>「房主一點點都不肯讓步麼？」我問。</p>
<p>「常然囉！我們先說打好仗再說，他們不肯，我們又說等一年，半年，最後甚至說再等三個月，他們簡直連半天都不肯讓！不打仗，也許可以另想法子，現在這上海，三千多房客你說往那處搬？</p>
<p>這鬥爭，還繼續延長着，希望租界當局及中間調停的人，能够給他們一點點援助。</p>
<p>據說慶餘里房屋重建以後，擬更名「順天村」，有衛生設備，每宅由五千元至八千五百元，十年租金，可分期付款，照此計算，在地主方面立致數十萬元，似乎只是一舉手的事情。</p>
<p>不過，我們以爲在舉國抗戰的時候，地主方面似乎也應當爲三千餘房客設身處地想一想，假如你們自己住在慶餘里，你說怎麽辦？</p>

<h3>蘇州人繞辮子</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>蘇州人以文弱著名，他們長於辭令，，而不善於打架，所以有句俗語，「寗可與蘇州人相罵，不要與寗波人白話」，因爲寗波人白話，十分硬綳綳也。</p>
<p>但蘇州人有時亦要打架，他們打架的藝術，便是先繞辮子，先來一個示威行動，使對方屈服，倘然對方定見不屈的話，結果弄假成眞，也未可知。</p>
<p>但是蘇州人到底是蘇州人，他們專繞辮子而不肯打架：寗波人實在是硬漢，三句「娘戲撇」，便要拔出拳頭去打。</p>

<p>曾經有一件事，蘇理雅太太酬謝金澹雲五千　美金，金澹雲不願受。但這筆酬謝金是公開的，蘇理雅太太非送給她不可。金澹雲便請命於外交委員會，外交委員會命令金澹雲可以領受，命澹雲領受了。她便以她父親的名義，捐了　筆獎學金，資助遺族中無力升學的子女。因此大家都贊稱金澹雲不置，連蘇理雅太太也更加器重她了。這次金澹雲和林建成結婚，蘇理雅太太想大大地送她一份禮的。但倘然送她錢，她是萬萬不肯收受的，幷且送她錢，也好似失了敬意。因此蘇理雅太太知道他們結婚以後，要去蜜月旅行，便想送他們、輛家庭旅行汽車，就是所謂活動的家一也者。這個家庭租賃公司，雖然還沒有開張，可是打的汽車樣子，已經不少送來了。蘇理雅太太想選擇一輛最合式，設備最完善的，最合於蜜月旅行用的車子，送給金澹雲，作爲奩贈。但楚金澹雲還是不肯收受，她說：『我們實在不鬆要這種車子，因爲我與林建成，大家都有職業，不能時常出去旅行。即使偶然出門，我們的旅行，却是職業上的旅行，不能讓我們自由自在的出去游玩的。我們結婚以後，兩人都有一個假　，我們原想出去旅行游玩二我們也可以試試這種家庭旅行車的便利。但不過一個月的期限罷了，我們以後還是要組織固定的小家庭的。現在對於那種車子，作爲租借性質，或者爲試騐實用起見，我們用它一個月，至於贈送，却萬不敢接受的。』蘇理雅太太見她不肯接受，也只得罷了。此刻金澹雲也不能多耽擱，忽忽的回上海去了。再說朱愛人陪了何氏姊妹，便到自由村來。朱老源朱村長預先早已知道今天他的孫女愛人，要陪她的兩位同學到此地來，因此在家守候着。此外便是朱愛人的母親朱太太，還有朱愛人的當房姊姊朱愛羣，也都在家。這個自由村，却是個新村，與　樂鎭便有些不同了。因爲安樂鎮近年來雖也逐漸改良，但它有許多地方，米脫本來面目。不比自由村，完全新組成起來的，它却有一種新的氣象呀。（一〇六）</p>

<h3>「中電」抗戰片　「孤城喋血」全部攝竣</h3>
<p>— 慧存</p>
<p>五月五日起在渝獻映</p>
<p>勝利的前奏</p>
<p>中央電影塲自遷至重慶後，爲了物質條件的限制，使預定開拍的幾部影片，都無法動手。但是在新聞片方面，先後仍有「淞滬前綫」「東戰塲」「活躍的西綫」「抗戰第九月」諸片的完成。以前對於引爲困難的電力佈景及內景塲地等問題，直到去年夏天才相繼解決，而正式的拍片工作也從這時開始的。</p>
<p>中電預定的第一部出品是「孤城喋血」抗戰新聞片，該片自從去年開始攝製以來，因材料問題，工作時吿停頓，及至最近，始行全部攝製完竣。該片故事是叙述姚子靑將軍死守寳山城的那段壯烈的史蹟，演員方面如柏森，白雲，包時等都是受過大學敎育的，雖則他們不是倚老賣老的大明星，在銀幕上演劇的經騐也許不很熟練，但是他們的熱忱與努力却是使該片例外生色不少的。</p>
<p>跟着「孤城喋血」同時攝竣的，還有一部「勝利的前奏」，該片是抗戰新聞實錄片，所以，它是歸納於「對日抗戰新聞實錄片」第五卷的，在這部片中，有「新生活運動五週紀念」的大會實情，蔣委員長向婦女同胞的訓詞，宋美齡女士爲婦女獻金而發表意見，以及我西北騎兵製擊的雄姿和日人狼狽逃竄的一幕幕實錄，全片都是使人看了感到異常興奮的鏡</p>
<p>現在，道二部攝竣的抗戰片，已於五月五日起在重慶「新川」「國泰」「唯一」三家影院同時開始獻映了。</p>
<h3>電影院　如雨後春筍</h3>
<p>— （樂天）</p>
<p>五家正籌建　四家在談判</p>
<p>上海這地方，可算天堂地獄，苦樂懸殊，眞是不可思議，居民將近五百萬，把孤島擠得滿坑滿谷，各種生意，利市三倍，允其娛樂塲所，那一天不是日夜客滿。許多游藝商人，樂得生財有道，據說又有五家電影院，正在積極籌建中，秋季將陸續開幕。這五家地點：（一）在麥特赫司脫路愛文義路口，（二）麥特赫司脫路靜安寺路相近；（三）靜安寺；（四）福煦路金門大戲院相近；（五）貝當路近徐家滙。那幾家名稱尙未決定，還有四家因無適當地點，一時恐不易見諸事實吧。</p>
<h3>紀高盛麟與高世壽</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>武生中自從楊小樓去世，一時顧曲家都說沒有武戲可看，此話好像近情理，但如果沒有人獎勵後進，那麽也是一件不應該的事情。所以我們如果發見優秀人材，應當宣傳宣傳，比了那些有作用的捧塲似乎有意義。</p>
<p>我現在介紹給你們富連成四科的高盛麟，他是名伶高慶奎的哲嗣，從小就練工，自不必說，從富連成出科之後，叉跟楊小樓學，小樓的外甥女便是嫁給盛麟的。（小樓的女婿是劉硯芳，硯芳是盛麟的丈人峯）因爲姻親的關係，又兼以盛麟好學不倦，所以小樓對於盛麟另眼相看，雖沒有幾年，在實際上倒學成了不少的眞實功夫。在小樓臨終的幾天，盛麟沒有離開過楊家，感情上也十分密切的。說到盛麟迄回到上海來，我們也要拿士別三日的目光來看，我這裹先把頭五天的戲碼報吿一聲，第一天長板坡，第二天挑滑率，第三天冀州城，第四天惡虎村，第五天英雄義，讀者在看了之後，或者可以對於我相信不是吹，而是說老實話了。</p>
<p>還有一位他的弟弟，才二十一歲，比他哥哥小四歲，呌高世壽，一看名字就知道是富連成五科的，工夫也是了不得，什麼花蝴蝶，四杰村，界牌關等等，都是拿手傑作。他們兩人這一次差不多都在一齣戲裏頭的多，雖然帶來有張連廷，（即隨轉盛麟來申的）世壽雖然剛過弱冠，而已經善於交際，說話頗動聽，看他又很端莊，您要不說是高世壽，誰知道他會那麽些好本領呢。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>高盛麟之長坂坡</h3>
<h3>「慾魔」前奏</h3>
<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>在世界劇壇上享有盛名的俄國大文豪托爾斯泰所著的「慾魔」，原名是「黑暗的勢力，」在上海曾由中旅，業餘，中法等各劇團先後演出，因其劇情緊湊，而且針刺着中國現社會的黑暗面，故到處受到觀衆的熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>因為它是一部不朽的名作，含有諷刺現社會整飭風紀的寫實故事，新華公司的名導演岳楓先生故決定將是劇重冉改編，搬上銀幕。</p>
<p>在銀幕上的慾魔」，其一切演出，當然較舞台劇來得像眞，緊張，同時對看過「慾魔」話劇的觀衆，急於需知而在話劇上未能繼續演出的，自李琦受良心上的痛楚與責備悔悟後的最後結果是如何？岳導演在這裹，也予各觀衆以一個極圓滿的答覆。</p>
<p>在銀幕上的「慾魔」，演員的分配，都能適合着各人的性格，這是岳楓盡了數日夜的硏討才決定的。</p>
<p>山梅熹演飾狠心懦弱，行動矛盾的長工李琦，這是一個最難演的角色，然梅熹演來，都能恰到好處，這，却是難能可貴的，風流狠毒，謀殺親夫，活埋嬰孩的少婦花月英，是由陸露明飾演的，談瑛在這戲中，飾張小金，她演迄角色是最適合不過的，一個鮮活的小金，眞好似是露在我們的眼前，新人李　，她飾和李琦負生肉　　儒而被遺　的小姑娘王　業，她在被李琦　出的時候，一付悽惋的表情，令觀衆都為之　　情之淚，其他如何劍飛飾性情怪戾的張裕編，嚴斐飾實和狡猾的李洪氏，王桂林飾忠厚誠實的李大順，湯傑飾胡大愚，王玲玲飾張小銀，田太萱飾王母，劉繼羣飾陳老兒，尤光照飾陳之姪兒，都能切合身份。</p>
<p>「慾魔」，銀幕上的「慾魔」，可以說一句，不論在任何方面都是成功的，它在最近即將在金城大戲院上映。</p>
<h3>徐蘊慧的六月雪</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>我所最欣賞的，是斬娥一塲的開始，當我看前幾時湖社票房演出「六月雪」的時候。</p>
<p>演竇娥的是票友徐　　　士。「探監」一塲，竇娥是尋常的臉，尋常的衣服，像一般貧寒女子的靑衣妝扮一樣。可是，到了「斬娥」一塲的開始，就完全不同了。一開頭就是緊敲鑼鼓，雖說是讓竇娥能有換衣服的機會，其空氣却特別的緊張。等到簾幕一揭，兩個劊子手便突然挾竇娥上塲。右面的一個劊子手很是精彩，兇惡的豎眉，一團殺氣的臉，一根野鷄毛揷在盔上，露出了多肉的肥胖胸脯，威風凜凜的亮着刀，幫助着製造了不少像眞的雰圍氣。我很奇怪這胖劊子手的成功，及至一打聽，原來他就是李琴仙先生的反串，無怪乎演得這樣好呢！</p>
<p>寶娥則穿着紅衣服，手背綁着，後面揷了一根白旗。寶娥的臉上塗了油彩和黑墨條，閉着　　，低著頭，走幾步，一會　又睜開眼，這時全塲　千的看戲的人都屏息着　，一　　不　，給予　　無　的同情，台下的人與台上的人化成一片，寶娥的痛苦就是很衆的痛苦。我們　實娥設想，她這時恐怕已經嚇得昏沉沉的了吧。你瞧，她運話都說不全了！她有氣無力地微昂起頭說了一個上字，再說一個天字，接着再從　縫　　力迸出無路觔　字。這樣，　　增加悲喜的　　了！這四個字已經很够，這以下的「入地奮門」和其他的唱句都不必要了！這四個字足抵得一大段的唱句血有觸，在這樣的情景之下，這四個字有千鈞之力。要不然，怎能博得全塲的釆聲呢！</p>
<p>這是一個不容易得到的境界，觀者與演　打成一片，融合無間。倘若不是徐女士平時的努力磨煉，怎麽會有這樣的成就呢！</p>
<p>所以我說，當我看六月雪的時候，我所最欣賞的，是斬娥一塲的開始。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>軍閥慘殺優伶的殘暴行為</p>
<p>褚玉璞原籍山東濟寗，家道貧塞，他的胞兄，名呌玉鳳，長他的有十齡，玉璞自幼就不舉好，十幾歲時就跟着些匪人瞎泯，在魯省閙出人命　案，不能立足，遂竄入蘇境的徐州，後來名聲一天大似一天，被官府捕拿甚緊，他不得已才散了伙，獨自一個人隱藏在城北的趨家圩子裏。趙氏族中有一人名呌趙瑤蘊的，把他留養在家下，待他十分恩厚。民國二年時，冷遹任第三師帥長，駐守徐城，他對於剿匪的方法，是恩威並用，凡能悔過自新的，一律都可招撫，褚玉璞也是當時很著名的匪首，听以他同超盤和尙（亦巨匪）都在那年改邪歸正，被冷氏委任營長之職了。彼時張宗昌任團長，方振武任輜重營營長，後來張，褚，方，三人發生密切關係，也就是從那時開始的。褚在這時忽然結識了一個土娼名喚王香亭的，二人打得火熱。不料二决光復，冷軍被馮國璋打得大敗，退守江寗後，已潰不成軍，這時褚玉璞父受了馮督的收編，同時長腿將軍也就被委爲將校團團長，二人都常住余陵。不過他們都非行伍出身，常爲人所歧視，又兼揮霍無度，鬧了虧空，故而不久就都　開了南京，先後投奔關外的張作霖去了。褚因徐州是他的第二故鄕，一來想看望曾經救　（其實是窩藏）渦他的恩人趙瑤蘊，二來也順便探望他的舊情人王香亭。誰知王女士雖是個土娼，但是爲人極其豪爽，一聽褚氏要到關外去謀發展，她立時就把所有的首飾兌了五六百塊錢，雙手奉與老褚，當作一路的盤費，餘剩下的，還可以作爲交際等費之用。所以後來張作霖一入關，老褚就作了張宗昌部下的旅長，長腿以蘇，魯，豫，皖，四省剿匪司令名義駐兵徐州時，褚與王香亭覩面之下，那種感激和親密的情形，當然是達於極點了。未到兩年，張褚都作了怪辦，這些老粗也還懂得知恩報恩，於是首先就把一位略識之無的趙寨主（瑤蘊）請到天津督辦公署裏，當了總參議。趙氏本來人口衆多，一齊尋到天津，大小全都弄到個官兒，當時督署的八大處以及老褚統帶的部隊裏，無不有姓趙的族人置身其間，一時曾有趙半旅的流行語，由此也可見褚氏優遇趙氏族人之一斑了。—（七）—</p>

After a fierce half-day battle, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and Daling was recovered. The Chinese army is currently pursuing the remaining Japanese troops between the Gao'an and Fengxin highways. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: On the morning of the 6th, a portion of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Japanese troops at Wushi, fifteen li northwest of Nanchang. After several hours of intense fighting, the Chinese army finally annihilated the Japanese troops there. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Shanggao: At 10:00 AM on the 8th, the Chinese army recovered the strongholds of Genggulou and Daling (both north of Gao'an), killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing a large amount of military supplies. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: The Chinese Western Route Army besieging Nanchang has now crossed Shuangling (near Meiling) and is advancing towards Niuxing Railway Station, taking a four-sided encirclement posture against the Japanese troops in Nanchang. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: Nanchang has been surrounded on all sides by the Chinese army in recent days. The Japanese troops are very panicked and are constantly reinforcing from the Nanxun line. Japanese troops and steamships are also traveling back and forth on the Gan River for transport. Fires have reignited in the city of Nanchang since the 6th, intermittently burning for two days. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: A certain route army of the Chinese forces besieging Nanchang rounded to the north of Nanchang this morning, cutting off the Japanese troops' communication between Nanchang and Lehua, and are advancing towards Niuxing Railway Station in several routes. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fuliang: Dingshan and Yangjiashan were recaptured on the 6th. Subsequently, the Japanese army launched a large-scale counterattack and retook the suburbs of Pengze. The battle is still ongoing. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After the Chinese army completed its military strategy of surrounding Nanchang, the Japanese army's plan to attack northern Hunan had already failed. The Chinese army is now attacking north along the highway. The Japanese army is attempting to resist with mechanized units and heavy artillery. According to Chinese reports, a unit of Chinese guerrillas and plainclothes soldiers rushed into the city of Nanchang, engaging in close combat with isolated Japanese troops. One strong Chinese unit annihilated the Japanese garrison and recaptured Wushicheng (transliteration), one mile northwest of Nanchang. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in the western suburbs of Nanchang. There is now a garrison stationed there, attacking the vanguard of the Chinese army. The Chinese army attacked Tongcheng on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, resulting in thousands of Japanese casualties. As a result of the fierce fighting on the Huayuan-Xiangyang highway, the Japanese army lost 3,000 men. The fighting there is still continuing. Chinese military experts pointed out that in the past ten days, the Chinese army's counteroffensive in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan has been extremely smooth. The ratio of Chinese to Japanese deaths in this battle is one to two. The Chinese army has launched offensives in several places to prevent the Japanese army from concentrating its forces. Chairman Chiang's plan for the cooperation of the Chinese regular army and guerrillas has been effective. The Chinese side will use this strategy in future battles. (9th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese war reports received here state that approximately 100,000 Chinese troops in the Dabie Mountains northwest of Hankou are retreating after being heavily pressured by the Japanese army last week.

Japanese troops at Nanlin Bridge (southwest of Tongshan) launched a three-pronged counterattack against the Chinese army on the morning of the 8th.

<p>Xingji: On the evening of the 7th, at 10:00 PM, the Chinese army attacked Xiaoheyuan (northwest of Zhaocheng), Ganhezhen (south of Xiaoheyuan), and Zhaocheng County simultaneously, with fierce fighting breaking out on all fronts, tying down a large force of Japanese troops. Powerful Chinese units were then able to cross the Fen River to the east, destroying another seven or eight li of railway north of Zhaocheng, and blowing up two bridges at Xinzhi Station (south of Huoxian). Due to repeated interruptions by the Chinese army, the Japanese army transferred over a thousand troops from Hongdong on the Tongpu Line at 8:00 AM on the 8th, adding them to Wan'anzhen, with the appearance of disturbing the Chinese area west of the Fen River. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: Nanguanzhen (southeast of Pingyao) on the northern route of the Baijin Highway was attacked by the Chinese army on the morning of the 1st. Over 400 Japanese soldiers and six mountain field guns stubbornly resisted the Chinese army. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army charged into the town, resulting in street fighting. Because the Japanese army stubbornly defended fortifications and released a large amount of poison gas, more than 40 Chinese officers and soldiers were poisoned and withdrew to outside the town, confronting the Japanese army. Japanese troops at Wanghezhen (east of Jiexiu) forcibly conscripted laborers today to repair the highways west to Jiexiu, Lingshi, and Zhangbaozhen (southeast of Pingyao). Chinese units are currently carrying out ambushes and obstructions. In other news, Bizhaizhen (southeast of Wanghe) has been recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops at Gu County Town, southeast of Anze, also withdrew to the county town early on the 4th. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Disclosure by Finance Ministry Spokesperson</p>
<h3>Another Conspiracy by the Japanese Puppets to Disrupt Finances; No One Willing to Accept "Huaxing" Counterfeit Currency; Foreign Businesses to Protect Their Own Interests Will Continue to Support Chinese Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) When meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters on the 9th, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance expressed the following views on the establishment of the "Huaxing Commercial Bank" by the Japanese puppets in China. After the enemy's attempt to undermine our currency system by establishing the puppet United Reserve Bank in North China failed, they are now trying to implement the same conspiracy in Central China by establishing the so-called Huaxing Commercial Bank. However, this conspiracy will also end in failure. This new financial conspiracy of the enemy is obviously a preliminary strategy to attempt to implement a financial system centered on Shanghai. However, the stability of the financial system in Shanghai is closely related to the vital interests of foreigners. If the enemy's control attempt is realized, it will not only deal a major blow to the interests of foreigners in Central China, but also reflect the fact that the enemy's finances have reached a dead end. The enemy is in urgent need of money to pay for war expenses and support puppet organizations, and has exhausted all methods to collect money in its military occupation areas. The purpose of establishing the bank in North China was to force the people to use non-convertible and worthless paper money. Now that the enemy's looting in North China has reached its limit, but it is still in urgent need of money, it has turned its target to Central China. The new bank planned by the enemy is a commercial bank, and it is said that half of its capital is borne by enemy banks and half by the puppet government. Given the past failure of counterfeit currency in North China, it can be asserted that unless forced by the enemy's military force, no one will be willing to accept the paper money to be issued by this new counterfeit bank. Although the enemy uses deceptive words, its new conspiracy will still fail, because the public knows the truth of the facts very well. Our government will take appropriate countermeasures, which goes without saying. If it is said that foreign banks will accept the new counterfeit banknotes, or accept deposits from the new counterfeit bank, or engage in other transactions with it, no one believes it. For the sake of their own interests and the interests of the public, all foreign banks will continue to support our country's currency system. Moreover, in November 1933, the British government announced that China's national currency was the only legal currency for British transactions in China. It is expected that all relevant foreign circles will take appropriate actions to protect their own interests. At the same time, foreign governments will also protest to the Japanese authorities against this new financial conspiracy of the Japanese side. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance commented today on the establishment of a Sino-Japanese joint venture bank in Central China, saying that the United Reserve Bank established by the Japanese in North China has failed, and now they are trying to perform the same trick in Central China, which will undoubtedly repeat the same mistakes. Japan's new financial plan clearly attempts to forcibly control the financial system centered on Shanghai by the Japanese. The security of this system is of great importance to the interests of foreigners. If it is controlled, it will cause serious damage to the interests of foreigners in Central China and throughout China. The Chinese government has no choice but to take countermeasures, which are currently under discussion. (9th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Fuzhou</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) This afternoon, Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed Fuzhou twice, targeting places such as the Datoutou Bridge and Cangxia Island, especially large buildings such as business houses, stores, companies, and hospitals, dropping more than 30 incendiary and explosive bombs, destroying hundreds of houses and causing heavy losses.

<h3>Mo Dehui and Others Pay Tribute to the Panchen Lama</h3>
<p>Ganzi: Mo Dehui, the leader of the Western Sichuan-Kang Construction Inspection Group of the Sichuan-Kang Construction Inspection Group, and his party of seventeen people departed from Sichuan on March 18 to inspect.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan and the German-Italian Alliance</h3>
<p>In our previous commentary on the evolving international situation, we recognized the brewing turbulence and its far-reaching impact, which could not be ignored for even a moment. However, we also felt that we could at least allow ourselves a week or even half a month of quiet observation to watch the changes unfold. Unexpectedly, in just these three days, extraordinary phenomena have emerged, seemingly indicating that new developments will follow one after another.</p>
<p>In these three days: the agreement between Britain and Turkey is reported to have been definitively established, and France is about to join. This is a militarily crucial element of the European democratic nations. The Anglo-Soviet negotiations, which were previously viewed as having stalled due to the departure of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, and whose future seemed exceptionally bleak and uncertain, have now been continued by British Ambassador to Moscow Sir Seeds and the new Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The content of the talks is being kept strictly confidential by both parties. The Soviet side is maintaining a deep and reserved demeanor, while the British and French sides are spreading optimistic reports. We have no way of knowing the actual situation, and we do not need to predict whether it will be auspicious or ominous. However, this is an exceptionally important development in the making, and once revealed, it will certainly be seen as an important factor in the future international situation. Given the reasons for the replacement of the Soviet Foreign Minister and the immediate continuation of talks after the replacement, it can be predicted that the unveiling is not far off. These two events are major events of the past few days and are indeed what we call extraordinary phenomena. However, the decision of Germany and Italy to conclude a political and military alliance, and the corresponding diplomatic activities of Britain and Japan, have the potential to promote a brand new development in the international situation, which is now an extraordinary foreshadowing.</p>
<p>The conclusion of a political and military alliance between Germany and Italy can be interpreted in various ways: 1. Strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact; 2. Eliminating the anti-communist slogan; 3. Proof of the past superficial harmony between the two countries; 4. Reinforcing the collusion between the two countries in aggression; 5. The two countries have in fact been allied for a long time, and now they are showing off for demonstration purposes; 6. Retreating in the face of difficulty, unable to find a solution, and using this as a cover; 7. Reversing course and making a last-ditch effort in desperation, a final preparation; 8. Demonstrating the firm and resolute intentions of the two countries to Japan in response to Japan's wavering attitude. All of these have very different meanings, and the causes and consequences are different. It is difficult to say at this moment to which it actually belongs. It is like a couple who have been living together openly for a long time, have been living together for a long time, and have children. Suddenly they announce their decision to marry. It cannot be said that it is not a new fact. It can be said that there is a new reason. It can be said that it is a natural procedure and a natural result. What is the purpose, we can only wait for the facts to explain later. However, the impact has caused both Britain and Japan to be alarmed. Britain is developing its consistent diplomatic style. Japan is deliberately showing restraint, showing that it will wait for the price and sell itself, and will choose people and serve them. As far as Britain is concerned: it is determined to unite with the Soviet Union, but it is reluctant to give the Soviet Union any kind of support for the contradictions and crises between the Soviet Union and Japan. This is one aspect. The close relationship between Germany and Italy has reached this stage. However, Britain has not completely abandoned the idea of ​​differentiation and appeasement. At the same time, it is working hard to organize an anti-aggression group to confront it. This is another aspect. In China, its rights and interests are being severely exploited; in the occupied areas of China, there is an anti-British action led by Japan; the ambassador who occasionally goes to Chongqing enjoys a full performance by the Japanese Air Force; the anti-British propaganda and anti-British movement in Japan are pressing; however, the British diplomatic authorities indicated to the Japanese envoys stationed in Britain, praising Japan for not being tempted by the German-Italian military alliance, and "frankly" informing them of the content of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, that is, Britain refused to accept the Soviet Union's proposals regarding the Far East, that is, the British newspapers also used implicit words regarding the possibility of Anglo-Japanese rapprochement, saying that the British authorities have long had this desire, saying that Japan's actions are gradually tilting in this direction; this is another aspect. Each aspect can show the exquisite and transparent nature of British diplomacy. We have always praised Britain's diplomatic style for planning its national affairs well in response to the international environment. However, how much has the international situation been affected by Britain's diplomatic style? At the beginning of the European War and after the September 18th Incident, if British diplomacy had been stronger, Germany's defeat might not have been so tragic, and Japan's self-entrapment might not have been so deep: and the sacrifices of those who interacted with Germany and Japan would not have been so great.</p>
<p>As far as Japan is concerned: Although it has repeatedly made informal expressions of refusing to participate in the German-Italian military alliance. In fact, it is still worried about gains and losses and is half-hearted; its subjective free control and objective hesitation also form a "fifty-fifty" division. This is because those who are cautious and those who are radical in Japan cannot reconcile at least on the issue of German-Italian relations. Why is this? It is said that the views, ideas, and desires are different, and Mo Ning said that it is because everyone lacks confidence and grasp. Only because of lack of confidence and grasp, it is expected to be entangled in the international community. Entanglement is beneficial or harmful, capable or incapable, and both positive and negative are not controlled by oneself. Looking at Ambassador Shigemitsu, who rushes to the door of Halifax; Ambassador Oshima, who runs between Ribbentrop and Ciano; and his Minister of the Army, Itagaki, who said that Japan could not join the German-Italian military alliance; and Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso, who said that it depends on Germany and Italy understanding Japan; and his spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who did not answer reporters' inquiries. In various forms, is it that Japan also has its established national policy, which is only unfathomable to others? It must not be so. However, there is one comprehensive explanation that can be given to their national policy, that is, what they call anti-communism, or what they call not anti-democracy, or what they call not being in the ranks of omnipotent countries, or what they call pro-Britain and the United States, or what they call pro-Germany and Italy, or even what they call should be pro-Soviet, all of which are not related to reason, emotion, or belief; it is important to know that Japan has been fighting hard in China for more than 20 months, and there is no way to extricate itself. How can it be leisurely and talk about what is pro or estranged? There is something called approval and opposition; their only problem and only national policy at present is to seek how it can be beneficial to them in China. It is said that for Germany and Italy, and even for Britain and the Soviet Union. Everything must be centered on their so-called China problem. Holding Germany and Italy to demand Britain, and demanding Britain to alienate the Soviet Union, how can they ask the ding of Europe!</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Chongqing, Arousing Strong Reactions; Sichuanese Grind Their Teeth at the Cruelty of the Japanese, Shout Love and Support for Chairman Chiang; British Ambassador to Japan Ordered to Protest</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Since Japanese planes bombed civilians in Chongqing on May 3rd and 4th, all Party, government, and military organs, under the instructions and guidance of Chairman Chiang, have been mobilized to relocate and shelter the affected people, treat the wounded, collect the dead, restore traffic, and reorganize the disaster areas in an intense and orderly manner.  As a reporter, I have been observing the situation daily and deeply recognize that the government and the people share each other's sorrows, support each other in illness, and console each other in death. They have fully demonstrated the spirit of sincere unity in resisting aggression and building the nation. What is especially moving is that Chairman Chiang personally inspected the disaster areas on the 9th. The disaster-stricken people paid their respects and cheered all along the way. Some shouted to support the central government that saves the country and the people, some shouted love and support for the leader who saves the country and the people, and some shouted that the more cruel the enemy is, the stronger we will be. Some were even so moved that they wept. Chairman Chiang offered brief condolences to the disaster victims along the way and earnestly exhorted the service teams of the Party, government, and military to work hard.  The reporter happened to pass by at that time, and after Chairman Chiang left, I inquired with the people, who unanimously expressed their gratitude to Chairman Chiang for loving the people like his own children. At the same time, they pointed their fingers and glared, saying that the enemy's indiscriminate bombing only destroyed their property but could not destroy their spirit of resisting aggression. They vowed to avenge this great hatred. On the way back, the reporter met a certain important figure of the central government and told him about the inspection by Chairman Chiang. The important figure smiled and said, "The enemy is spreading rumors that Chairman Chiang has gone to Chengdu and that the central government will also leave Chongqing. You have personally seen Chairman Chiang among the people. The enemy's bombing of civilians in Chongqing is enough to show that their invasion plan has reached its end. To fabricate such rumors even more shows that their rumor-mongering skills have also reached their end. Chairman Chiang's diligence in Chongqing in caring for the people's suffering, you have already seen. The central government has absolutely no intention of moving, which I deeply know. The enemy's rumor-mongering skills stop here, pitiful and laughable. They do not even consider themselves and broadcast it widely, thinking they are afraid they are not deceiving enough people, but in reality, they are advertising their own poverty and ugliness." Not only that, but the surroundings of consulates and churches of various countries stationed in Chongqing are all civilians. This is well known to people of various countries in Chongqing, but the enemy still tries to fabricate excuses to shirk responsibility, claiming that there are military installations. This is something people of various countries deeply know to be false and is not just something we despise. The reporter is pleased to have personally witnessed Chairman Chiang's demeanor in this trip, to have deeply recognized the spirit of unity between the top and bottom, and to have exposed the enemy's exhausted rumor-mongering skills. Therefore, I put down my pen to record it. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Since Chongqing suffered from the Japanese planes'狂炸, on the one hand, a large number of residents have been enthusiastically evacuated, and on the other hand, the government authorities have been actively providing relief. Chairman Chiang personally instructed to allocate hundreds of government vehicles, including his own, as transportation for evacuating refugees. Therefore, vehicles carrying refugees in and out are continuously moving, day and night. As of yesterday, the number of refugees moved out has reached more than 200,000. In addition, machinery, furniture, cotton, paper, etc., are also being transported away from Chongqing. Currently, there is only one newspaper in Chongqing, and its size has been greatly reduced. However, several newspapers may resume publication within a few days. This is the result of the bombing, with two newspaper offices completely destroyed and four suffering significant damage. As for the government, it has decided not to relocate. The ministries and departments that should be evacuated have already implemented evacuation several months ago. Those who are now stationed in Xindu will not move under any circumstances. Several schools have already been evacuated, and all hospitals have also been moved to safe areas. Seven temporary hospitals are being established nearby in the countryside to accommodate wounded soldiers and civilians. In addition, the government has allocated 1 million yuan to relieve this great disaster. Each refugee is given 5 yuan in Chinese currency, and those who are destitute and homeless are given 30 yuan. Refugee shelters are being built outside the city to actively accommodate them, and special relief teams are being organized to help the elderly and the weak. Several shops in Chongqing reopened yesterday, but there is a lack of all essential supplies because the commercial center has been completely destroyed. The total number of deaths, injuries, and material losses is currently not accurately counted. It is estimated that no less than 3,000 people died in the disaster, and the property loss is incalculable. Although air raid alarms were still frequent yesterday, no Japanese planes were seen. This is because the Chongqing authorities have strengthened air defense measures, and Japanese planes only dropped bombs on nearby towns before escaping. Banks in Chongqing resumed business yesterday, and shops opened in the evening, with enthusiastic shoppers. (9th dispatch, Hai Tong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the losses from the Japanese air raid on Chongqing last Thursday, no official statistics have been released to date. However, according to recent estimates, there were 1,500 deaths, and no less than 5,000 people suffered losses. Most of the streets have been swept and cleaned. Machinery and printing presses are being transported away from Chongqing, and many newspaper offices are also relocating. It is reported that there is currently only one newspaper in Chongqing. (9th dispatch, Hai Tong News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The Times published an editorial today entitled "The Massacre of Chongqing," stating that the Japanese attack on Chongqing, carried out in densely populated residential areas of the city, resulted in almost all civilians being victimized, a large portion of whom were buried in flames. This kind of large-scale massacre is unprecedented, and the Japanese air force will carry out even larger attacks in the future. A year or two ago, several countries still believed that it would be beneficial to protest to Japan in the name of humanity and civilization against its intentional barbaric acts against civilians. But today, the world knows more details. The modern Japanese attitude towards Bushido clearly considers Bushido as fixed but should not interfere with acts of war. The Chongqing air raid is a particularly egregious event. Japan's desire to create terror among the people through acts of massacre is fully evident here. Chongqing has no value for bombing other than providing an excellent opportunity to destroy civilian lives. What is strange is that Japan still believes in the effectiveness of this kind of action. In fact, Japan should have known long ago that bombs are not enough to intimidate the Chinese people but only strengthen their determination to resist aggression. (9th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian published an essay today commenting on China's resistance war and paying attention to the air raid on Chongqing, stating that in an unjust war, the Japanese may think that killing a thousand Chinese people is not necessarily morally worse than killing a hundred or one person. But in reality, we have to judge the good or evil of actions based on their impact on human happiness or human suffering. According to this standard, the enormous suffering of the Chinese people is still the most important and terrifying issue among our current major problems. (9th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang personally visited the temporary shelters where refugees displaced by the Japanese air raids on the city on May 3rd and 4th were residing, inspected them for a week, and the refugees cheered endlessly after hearing Chairman Chiang's words of encouragement, and many shouted to support Chairman Chiang and that they would never surrender until death. The local authorities officially declared that rumors that Chairman Chiang had gone to Chengdu and that the National Government was considering moving to Chengdu or Kunming were all inaccurate.

<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese planes bombing the British consulate in Chongqing, the government has instructed Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to Japan, to formally protest to the Japanese government. (9th dispatch, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Japan Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has been instructed to protest to the Japanese government regarding the bombing of the British Consulate General in Chongqing by Japanese planes. Reuters heard that the British government's instructions to Clark Kerr only mentioned the damage suffered by British property, but Clark Kerr has already urged the Japanese government to pay attention to the excessive nature of the Japanese bombing of Chongqing on Thursday from a humanitarian point of view.

<h3>Chengdu News: Air Raid Alert, But No Japanese Planes Appeared</h3>
<p>Chengdu: There were two air raid alarms last night at 1:30 and 1:45 AM, but the all-clear was given at 4:15 AM because no Japanese planes were seen. A third alarm was heard at 5 AM, but Japanese planes still did not come, so the all-clear was given at 6:30 AM. This is the first time that Chengdu has had an air raid alarm at night. Many residents spent the night in air raid shelters, and some fled to the countryside. It is said that the crowd was so congested when leaving the city that several people were injured. British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr is in Chengdu and plans to stay for a few days. He arrived here at 3:00 PM today, and representatives from various groups in Chengdu welcomed him. British expatriates in Chengdu then held a tea party to entertain the ambassador. (8th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Yichang) Before dawn on Sunday, nine Japanese bombers flew to Yichang and dropped more than 50 bombs on various parts of the city. The foreign residential area was not spared. The outer wall and residence of the Swedish church were destroyed by a bomb. It is estimated that the dead and wounded are less than fifty. (8th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a report from the air force here today, Yichang encountered its first night raid on Monday evening. Two formations of Japanese planes, one with 21 planes at 1:00 AM on Monday night and the other with 11 planes at 4:00 AM on the same day, flew to Yichang to bomb, dropping dozens of incendiary bombs. However, most of them fell into the river, so there were very few casualties, only more than fifty people. (9th dispatch, Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Japan Strictly Controls Foreign Exchange; Several Foreigners Arrested for Violating Regulations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun reported that those who obtain foreign currency checks and drafts in Japan and take them to China can exchange them for Japanese yen at a rate nearly twice as high as the "strictly set exchange rate" within Japan. In order to end this so-called "exchange trading," Japanese police officers are stepping up the arrest of foreigners and others suspected of taking advantage of this situation. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department revealed that it has detained two foreigners of Balkan nationality for more than two weeks and is interrogating three foreign missionaries in order to obtain information about this incident. Although the amount of exchanged funds has not been announced, the police claimed that although warnings were issued frequently, strict currency control regulations were implemented, making it impossible to obtain US dollars, British pounds, or francs in Japan for trading purposes. However, there are still many people who receive remuneration from overseas traveling between Japan and Shanghai, exchanging checks from themselves and their friends for cash based on the market price of Japanese yen in Shanghai. Now this restriction is becoming tighter. The Japanese Ministry of Finance has recently ordered banks and travel agencies to refuse to sell foreign currency and traveler's checks to travelers going to Shanghai. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department recently arrested Father Corrat, a 38-year-old Catholic priest, for violating the new exchange regulations. Two days later, Baron Peyans, a 70-year-old Belgian reporter for Le Figaro in Paris, was also arrested shortly after returning to Japan from Shanghai. It is said that both have been interrogated in detail after their arrest. (9th dispatch, Reuters)</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister During the European War Strongly Advocated British-Soviet Cooperation to Stop Aggression; Japan's Extension of Power Severely Threatens British Territories; Not Far From the Indian Border, Enough to Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>During the House of Commons debate on the military training bill today, Lloyd George stated that he was bound to support the government, but he believed that the actual number of people called up was too small. Lloyd George reiterated that it is now imperative to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union, saying that the number of people Germany and Italy can place on the battlefield is twice the number that France, Poland, and Britain can place. Without the help of the Soviet Union, the guarantees given by Britain to Poland, Romania, and Greece would be difficult to fulfill. Moreover, Japan is now seeking hegemony from afar, controlling everything. During the European War, Britain obtained 1 million Indian troops, and France obtained 500,000 Vietnamese troops. Now that Japan is our enemy, how can we make up for this deficiency without Soviet assistance? (8th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Lloyd George's speech briefly stated: "I have repeatedly asked the government to deal with a strong attitude towards all countries that destroy the independence and freedom of our allies. Moreover, in principle, it can be said that there are very few democratic countries on the European continent that do not implement conscription. In terms of quantity, the Soviet Red Army has the largest land army formed by conscription in the world. In terms of quality, the French army has always been the most elite. Britain should catch up quickly. As for the relationship between the Far Eastern situation and Europe, we have always regarded Japan as an outsider. The Japanese authorities have repeatedly stated that they do not want to advise on European affairs, nor do they intend to send troops to assist the Axis powers in the war. What they are concerned about is only the Far East. People who have not thought deeply about this kind of statement often find it comforting. In fact, if we look at the map, we will know that Japan's advance is like a long spear pointed at the border of British territories. Since the establishment of the Hiranuma Cabinet, the Japanese army has advanced towards India by 200 miles and is no longer far from India. However, during the last European War, our country transferred 1 million fresh troops from India to defend Egypt, Palestine, and Iraq, while France also transferred 500,000 fresh troops from Vietnam and other territories. It can be seen that the Far Eastern territories of Britain and France are very important in national defense. Japan is an enemy country, and if we allow it to expand its power in Asia, we will let it become the greatest threat to the British Empire." Lloyd George concluded, "After Britain recently accepted all kinds of commitments from Eastern European countries, the Soviet Union should join the anti-aggression group so that Britain can fully fulfill its promises."

<h3>British House of Commons Questions Far Eastern Events; Government Pays Attention to Protecting the Interests of British Nationals at All Times</h3>
<p>(London) Conservative MP Morgan raised a question today regarding the newly established "Central Bank" in Nanjing, saying, "The British government does not recognize this currency by all merchants and traders. Are we going to take steps to protect the trade of British citizens?" Butler replied that the British government is already consulting with the Japanese government on this matter. Conservative MP Graham continued to ask, "Can British merchants and property owners in Nanjing return to that place? If they cannot, what actions will the government take?" Butler replied that the number of passes issued by the Japanese to British citizens to return to Nanjing is extremely limited. The British side has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities regarding the number of these passes and the conditions for their issuance. The British government believes that the Japanese authorities governing the area must be responsible for the safety of British citizens' property in Nanjing. The British interests there are currently being attended to by the resident consular staff. Graham asked further, "Has the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, recently visited Qingdao? Has he written a report on the difficulties faced by British citizens in operating businesses under the obstruction of the Japanese?" Butler replied that the government has not received any special reports or suggestions, but detailed information about the situation there is available at all times. There is currently a consul general stationed in that place. (8th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<h3>London and Tokyo Diplomatic Contacts; Review of British-Japanese Relations; Japanese Ambassador Kioi Shigemitsu Criticizes British Aid to China; Britain Points Out that Japan is Endangering British Interests in China</h3>
<p>(London) Japanese Ambassador to Britain Kioi Shigemitsu hosted a banquet at the embassy last night for British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. Those invited to accompany him included Foreign Office official Butler, French Ambassador Corbin, and the Danish and Dutch envoys and the American Consul General. British former Ambassador to Japan Lindsay was also invited. After the banquet, Kioi Shigemitsu held a long conversation with Halifax to continue the consultations conducted a few days ago to review British-Japanese relations. According to Hái Tōng Shè from informed sources, Halifax told Shigemitsu about the progress and prospects of the British-Soviet negotiations, expressing the hope that Japan would also inform Britain of the negotiations with Germany and Italy with the same frankness. In the conversation, Shigemitsu complained about Britain's assistance to China, saying that this assistance "benefits the Soviet Union in the Far East more than Chairman Chiang." On the other hand, Halifax solemnly stated the British government's concerns about Japan's actions in China, affirming that the British government considers the issuance of new currency by the Japanese authorities to be</p>
<h3>Japan's National Mobilization Bill to be Implemented in Full; Lack of Unified Command between the Army and Navy; War Against China Increasingly Entrenched in Difficulties</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to official sources today, Japan intends to fully implement Japan's National Mobilization Bill in order to end its war against China and to unify the command of the Japanese army and navy. After the full implementation of the National Mobilization Bill, Japan will be placed under extremely strict control, and all public and private activities will be subject to strict supervision and regulation. As for the need for unified command between the army and navy, this is because the two not only cannot cooperate recently but often contradict the government's important policies. Therefore, unless a solution to the "China Incident" can be obtained immediately, the unification of the army and navy will no longer be delayed. As for the National Mobilization Bill, it will be promoted regardless of everything. The Japanese National Mobilization Bill was passed by the Japanese Parliament last year, and several parts have been implemented since July. However, in the past month, there have been 52,000 incidents of people violating the National Mobilization Bill. Although most of them are insignificant, 20% of them have been handed over to the law. At the same time, during these nine months, the agencies implementing the National Mobilization Act have been added one after another. The production and consumption of goods have been under government control. Profits have also been restricted. Labor wages and working hours have also been regulated. Strikes have become criminal acts. Workers must register and have the obligation to be conscripted for technical work at any time. Other activities, such as people's fuel consumption and other innumerable activities, are restricted. Recently, prices have also been controlled. This matter is now presided over by former Finance Minister Ikeda Seihin, whose agency is the Central Price Commission (translated). Its purpose is to prevent Japan's malignant inflation and the severe devaluation of the Japanese yen. The exchange rate of the Japanese yen has always been maintained by artificial methods. However, Japan's previous control over prices was not very effective. For example, coal has risen from 35 yen per ton to 85 yen. The prices of various clothes and shoes made with substitutes are comparable to those made with real materials in the past. The transportation fees charged by drivers have also become significantly more expensive. Land rent and housing rent have also increased. The police have no way to stop them.

<p>a major threat to foreign interests in China. (9th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese Finance Minister Ishiwata Sotaro, Japan can develop China and "Manchukuo" even without foreign financial assistance. Japan's current material resources are still satisfactory, so Japan's industrial expansion plan will continue to be promoted. According to Ishiwata's statement to reporters, "We welcome foreign investment in the development of 'Manchukuo' and China, but in the current international environment, it is practically impossible to obtain significant foreign investment. Therefore, we do not consider this. Our current approach is still to seek development with our own strength." A reporter asked, "It has been reported that 'Manchukuo' is currently using American capital to develop its heavy industry. Is this true?" Ishiwata claimed that he was not aware of this. The reporter also asked whether the Japanese government's appointment of Nishiyama Taihei, director of the Yokohama Specie Bank, as the financial representative of Japan stationed in New York was for Japan to obtain foreign financial assistance. Ishiwata replied, "In the past, we had stationed a financial representative in London who concurrently managed the affairs of the United States and the United Kingdom. Later, we felt that this method was extremely inconvenient, so we also dispatched another person to New York to maintain closer contact with the United States and to make the American people understand Japan's economic status. But so far, we have not wanted them to have any concrete financial negotiations with financiers in New York." The reporter then asked, "There are often reports that Japan is severely lacking in material resources and unable to carry out large-scale industrial expansion. Is this true?" The Finance Minister replied that it was not true. "Generally speaking, Japan's material preparations have not decreased, so we will still implement the original industrial expansion plan." He also said that the government is currently considering establishing a Ministry of Trade to promote foreign trade. He went on to say that since setting aside 300 million yen for the foreign exchange equalization fund last year, it has been quite convenient to use. Ishiwata admitted that part of this fund has been used to purchase military materials. He also said, "We will continue to expand the 'linked currency' system so that we can obtain more raw materials for manufacturing export products. We hope this method can increase our foreign trade." The reporter then asked when Japan could abolish import controls and foreign exchange controls. The Finance Minister smiled and did not answer. (9th dispatch, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>British Shipping: War Risk Insurance Premiums Reduced</h3>
<p>(London) A major reduction in war risk insurance premiums for shipping was announced tonight. The main change is that the additional premium for passing through the Mediterranean or the Baltic Sea has been reduced from 20 shillings to 12 shillings and 6 pence per 100 pounds. According to a certain authority in the insurance industry interviewed by Reuters, the reason for the change in premiums is that the insurance association believes that the overall situation has gradually become stable and that premiums can be reduced.

<h3>Soviet Concern for the Eastern European Situation: Diplomatic Strategy Remains Consistent; Strengthening Relations with Poland and Romania; Britain Proposes Counter-Proposal to Anti-Aggression Organization</h3>
<p>Regarding the new counter-proposal for the organization of an anti-aggression bloc submitted by the British government, it was delivered to the new Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds. Diplomatic sources here recently stated that there is sufficient reason to believe that this new counter-proposal can be accepted by the Soviet Union, and that the country's foreign policy will not change due to the dismissal of the former People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov. Firstly, Soviet Ambassador Maisky provided a firm guarantee to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the country's current policy would not be altered. Secondly, Polish sources here stated that the Soviet government has already decided to appoint an ambassador to that country, indicating that the Soviet Union is eager to restore normal relations. Thirdly, after visiting Turkey and Bulgaria, the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, is now heading to Romania, indicating that the Soviet Union is eager to strengthen its influence in the Balkan countries and remains concerned about various European issues. As for the new counter-proposal put forward by Britain, although its content advocates that the Soviet Union should provide assistance to its neighboring countries, this assistance will only be implemented after Britain and France join the war. The British side believes that this new counter-proposal, even if it is revised in detail, can at least be expected to become the basis for a final agreement. (Havas, London, 8th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) British Ambassador Sir Seeds visited the new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, this afternoon and had their first conversation, which lasted forty minutes and was interpreted by an interpreter. This was the first time Molotov has received a foreign envoy since taking over foreign affairs. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The detailed report of the talks held yesterday between the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, and the Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and Foreign Minister, Molotov, has now been transmitted to London, and the government will give it careful consideration. According to speculation here, the Soviet government will seriously consider the opinions expressed by the British Ambassador during the talks, and a second round of talks could be held within a few days. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The British government's reply is a counter-proposal to Litvinov's proposal to conclude a tripartite alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, including the following two items: (1) The Soviet Union guarantees the five countries bordering the Soviet Union, namely Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Romania; (2) If the Soviet Union is drawn into war as a result of the above guarantee, the British government will come forward to help. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) After the meeting between British Ambassador Seeds and Molotov yesterday, the staff of the British Embassy felt quite optimistic, but refused to disclose the content of the talks. The general public believes that since the British and Soviet authorities have not issued a communiqué, there is still room for further talks between the two sides. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Warsaw. British Ambassador to Poland, Sir Howard Kennard, yesterday visited Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to inform him of the counter-proposal submitted by the British government to the Soviet Russian government regarding the organization of an anti-aggression front. Its content advocates that when any of the Soviet Union's neighbors are invaded in the future, if Britain and France send troops to assist, the Soviet Union will do its best to guarantee their independence. This counter-proposal is very welcomed by the Polish side. In addition, Lithuanian Commander-in-Chief General Raštikis arrived here at noon today. Soviet Deputy People's Commissar Potemkin is also scheduled to come here from the Romanian capital today to hold talks with Foreign Minister Beck, which must be of particular significance, because the Soviet Union had issued a statement before that, stating that if the Baltic coastal countries, namely Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, are invaded, it would be allowed to provide assistance. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Molotov's New Initiatives After Taking Office: Appointment of New Ambassador to Poland; Restoration of Normal Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Warsaw. Soviet Ambassador Davtyan has not returned to his post since returning to his country at the end of 1937. The Soviet government decided yesterday to appoint the former Minister to Greece, Sharonov, as the Ambassador to Poland and has obtained the consent of the Polish government. Foreign sources here said that this is a new initiative by the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, after taking office, and is of extreme importance in the current international situation. It can be seen from this that the Soviet government is eager to restore normal relations with Poland, which will surely be very satisfactory to the Polish authorities. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Warsaw. The appointment of the former Soviet Minister to Greece, Sharonov, as Ambassador to Poland has been well-received by military and political figures here, who believe that relations between the Soviet Union and Poland have improved. The non-aggression treaty signed between the two sides in 1932 was renewed last November, and Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin will come here on this day, all of which shows that the Soviet Union is willing to establish good neighborly relations with Poland. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Bucharest. The Soviet government's decision to appoint a new minister to Romania has recently been commented on by political figures here, saying that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland and Romania is closely linked in time. Since it has now decided to appoint a new ambassador to Poland, the vacancy for the minister to Romania will naturally not be left vacant for long. The Soviet Union's determination to focus on the situation in Eastern Europe can be seen from this. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Pope Suggests Convening; Five-Nation Conference; To Find a Solution; To the Danzig Problem</h3>
<p>(London) The Papal Representative to London, Archbishop Godfrey, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax the other day and reportedly suggested in the name of Pope Pius XII that a conference be held between representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to find a solution to the Danzig problem. Informed sources here commented that the Pope would only formally propose this suggestion after confirming that all the countries concerned agreed to it, and intended to convene the conference in the Vatican. Now, he is first trying to test the opinions of the British government to see if they would welcome it. In short, the Pope will study the reports sent by the envoys stationed abroad in the next few days, and then make a formal decision. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Military Alliance Issue: Japan Adopts Detached Attitude; Germany and Italy Plan to Exert Pressure to Force Japan to Comply; Negotiations Among the Three Governments Are Underway</h3>
<p>German sources here recently stated that Japan's attitude towards the Axis countries is, from Germany's point of view, too detached. Germany and Italy have now decided to conclude a political and military treaty, which can influence Japan and urge it to change its original intentions. Regarding this, the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan are in negotiations. The intention of Germany and Italy is to have Japan accept the restrictions of the treaty in military affairs. Up to now, that country has always been unwilling to interfere in European affairs, and has used the excuse that Germany and Italy have not concluded a military alliance treaty, and does not want to change the Anti-Comintern Pact into an alliance treaty. Now that Germany and Italy have concluded a political and military treaty, Germany can naturally use this opportunity to advise Japan to change its original attitude. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Diplomatic sources here are all asking about Japan's attitude towards the German-Italian Axis, and said that when the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy held talks in Milan the other day, Japan had no representative to participate, and it is unknown whether it is changing its attitude or observing the situation for the time being. According to reliable sources, although Japan has signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany and Italy, it still maintains freedom of action to a certain extent, and refuses to sign a military alliance treaty with those countries, because it does not want to accept restrictions, thereby forcing Britain and the Soviet Union to conclude an alliance treaty, and forcing the United States to become closer to the Western European countries. Germany and Italy reportedly strongly advised Japan, saying that if Britain and the Soviet Union establish an alliance treaty regardless of Japan's intentions, then Japan should resolutely sign a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. The Japanese side reportedly replied that it is not convenient to reveal in advance what Japan's attitude will be if this kind of situation occurs in the future. The implication is that it may not insist on dissenting to the proposal to join the German-Italian military alliance, but should still adopt a reserved attitude from now until then. Regarding this, although German sources in London said that the governments of Germany and Japan are continuing to contact each other, and there is a possibility of Japan and the German-Italian Axis becoming closer, Britain still hopes that Japan can handle things carefully to a certain extent. This can be seen from the fact that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie issued a statement to Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Horinouchi after the recent bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes, saying that the British government should regard this matter as a serious case, but did not file a formal protest. However, diplomatic sources here said that the British government should file a formal protest in Geneva based on "humanitarianism," and no matter what excuses the Japanese side cites, it is not enough to defend this reckless and destructive air raid. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Arita's Speech</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) When the National Governors Conference was held yesterday, Foreign Minister Arita addressed the meeting, detailing the recent developments in the European situation, saying that the Imperial Government felt it should strengthen the existing three-way anti-communist pact, so that it could cope with the international situation currently brewing from its own standpoint. Arita cited several examples of the remarkable progress made by Germany and Italy in the countries that are anti-communist, and then mentioned the activities of Britain and France in organizing a camp to surround Germany and Italy, and the fact that Britain and the Soviet Union are engaged in negotiations, hoping to invite the Soviet Union to join this camp, saying that Japan had to pay the greatest attention to Britain's proposal to invite the Soviet Union to join the British and French camp, not only because this matter affects the overall situation in the East. Arita then commented on President Roosevelt's proposal to Hitler and Mussolini to jointly guarantee European peace, saying that this proposal had attracted general attention because it contained a meaning of supporting Britain and France. However, it is believed that the United States' move has two purposes: (1) to make a gesture to the domestic audience; (2) to arouse public opinion against Germany and Italy, so that the United States does not have to directly resist Germany and Italy. Arita finally mentioned Japan's basic policy, saying that he firmly believed that the Imperial Government knew that if it wanted to restore the prosperity of the East, it could only achieve its goal by building the proposed "New Order in the East," and that the cooperation between Japan, "Manchukuo," and China could greatly benefit world peace. Arita concluded by saying that building a "New Order" in East Asia is Japan's historical and racial mission, and this mission originates from the great spirit of establishing the Japanese Empire.</p>
<h3>Eastern Report Commentary</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The tone of the Japanese newspapers all said that the conclusion of the German-Italian military agreement was caused by the encirclement policy of Britain and France, and took this opportunity to strongly advocate that Japan has the necessity to establish a firm policy to deal with the new situation. According to the observation of Jiji Shimpo, the encirclement policy of Britain and France is gradually being implemented, and the conclusion of the German-Italian military alliance is intended to effectively deal with this situation. Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the German-Italian agreement was to deal with the provocations of Britain and France, not to deal with Poland. The newspaper also believed that if Germany and Italy could prevent Britain and France's plan, a peaceful adjustment of the tense relations between Germany and Poland would not be impossible. Asahi Shimbun said that the Milan agreement had shattered Britain and France's hopes of alienating Germany and Italy. This agreement, no matter what, has proved that if war breaks out in Europe again, Italy will join the German side. The newspaper also said that this new agreement will further enhance the cooperation between the two countries and will have far-reaching effects, not only in Eastern Europe and the Balkans, but also in Spain. Chugai Commercial News stated that the conclusion of the German-Italian military agreement should be held jointly responsible by the encirclement policy of Britain and France. If the current negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are successfully completed, the division between Britain and Germany and between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will become more obvious, and the situation in the Far East will be affected by the situation in Europe. The situation in Europe will continue to change due to the increasing conflict between Germany and Italy and between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The newspaper also reiterated Prime Minister Hiranuma's speech at the Governors' Conference yesterday, emphasizing that Japan has the necessity to abandon the idea of maintaining the status quo in seeking a solution to the Sino-Japanese War, and urged the government to do its best to implement Japan's fixed and unchanging policy to cope with the new situation in Europe. Miyako Shimbun said that there is no doubt that the five ministers of Japan had discussed strengthening the anti-communist axis of Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo in successive meetings. The newspaper urged the government to formulate and announce its policy to reject the interference of Britain, France, and other pro-China countries in Chinese affairs, just as the joint efforts of Germany and Italy broke the encirclement policy of Britain and France. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Details of the German-Italian Alliance: To Be Discussed; To Be Signed Next Month</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to the Messaggero, the details of the German-Italian military agreement will be drafted in the next few weeks. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will meet again in early June to sign the document determining the scope and time limit of the mutual obligations of the two countries. The newspaper also said that this agreement will end the rumors of the collapse of the axis and the possibility of separation between Italy and Germany. Italy and its colonies and Germany form a group with 150 million people. In addition, the population of friendly countries must be added to this, which can show the true strength of the new alliance. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Milan. Yesterday, the German Foreign Minister made a statement regarding the German-Italian military alliance to German journalists at the Villa d'Este on Lake Como, as follows:</p>
<p>"The military alliance concluded by me and Ciano on behalf of Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini in Milan is the natural result of the situation that has existed for many years. Therefore, there is no change in the policies of the two countries. However, it is a clear testimony to the 'heroes of the pen' and 'war agitators' who are generally accustomed to spreading rumors, and at the same time announces to the world that all those who attempt to alienate the Axis countries will only be wasting their efforts." (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Berlin, stating that after returning to Germany from Milan, Italy, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will go to Berchtesgaden to report on the trip to Führer Hitler. The content is reportedly that the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy had already agreed on how to deal with the issues of the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, and had also agreed on a plan for the various demands made by Italy in the Mediterranean region. Now, they are in line with the wishes of both Germany and Italy. In addition, after the establishment of the German-Italian military political treaty, the two countries believe that a steel wall has been built from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Italian island of Sicily in the south. The German authorities will also vigorously publicize to the people of that country that the encirclement policy promoted by Britain has been broken. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily, which is jointly published by ten local newspapers, today published an editorial commenting on the German-Italian military alliance and explaining the significance of Japan's failure to join the alliance, saying that the formation of this alliance was not unexpected, it is not enough to increase the power of the axis, and it weakens the position of the German-Italian-Japanese anti-communist pact. Japan's failure to join the military alliance is not because Germany and Italy intend to abandon Japan, but because Japan is afraid of being drawn into the European war. Because of the war in China, Japan has to adopt a passive action in international affairs. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Italy; Presents Credentials</h3>

<h3>US Secretary of State Advocates; Convening Roundtable Conference; To Resolve All International Disputes; Based on the Spirit of Peaceful Understanding</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Secretary of State Hull advocated convening a roundtable conference, considering it the only way to resolve international disagreements. This morning, at the 10th International Congress of Military Medicine and Pharmacy, Assistant Secretary of State and Head of Personnel of the Department of State Massey Mees read out Hull's appeal, which stated, "People in the world must choose one of two paths, war and peace. People who love peace and are peace-loving must not be drawn into war against their wishes. The generosity, compassion, and understanding advocated by your organization are what is most urgently needed now. We Americans are willing to maintain harmonious relations with all countries in the world. We are eager for an international order based on justice, respect for the law, and respect for the dignity and value of the human spirit. We believe that countries can resolve disputes in a spirit of honor and peace by sitting together at the conference table on an equal footing. We are willing to maintain friendly relations with the people of all countries." Representatives from 31 countries, including Germany and Italy, attended today's conference.

<h3>Expressing Feelings at a Battlefield, Windsor Calls for Peace, Hoping Political Leaders of All Nations Take Responsibility and Work Together for the World to Avert Disaster</h3>
<p>After visiting the Verdun battlefield today, the Duke of Windsor broadcast an address to the Americas, stating that he was breaking his self-imposed silence because the crisis had become apparent and we may once again face the tragedy of 25 years ago. The Duke solemnly declared that his decision was solely based on his personal opinion as a soldier in the last war. He sincerely prayed that this brutal and destructive madness should never again overcome humanity. He believed that peace is a very important matter and should not be viewed as a political issue. In modern warfare, victory will go hand in hand with adverse forces and will inevitably lead to anarchy and chaos, with all people suffering the pain of displacement. This is true for Germany, as it is for Britain and France. There is still an opportunity to seek and discuss international understanding in a timely and thorough manner. Political tensions easily weaken the spirit of mutual compromise. In our personal contacts, we often strive for a harmonious life with our relatives and friends, otherwise civilization will never survive. If we cannot now apply what we apply to private matters to international affairs, are we going to destroy civilization? The Duke also strongly criticized harmful propaganda that poisons the will of the people, and said that he personally regretted the use of terms such as "encirclement" and "aggression" because they are enough to arouse the dangerous emotions that we should suppress. All actions of politicians engaged in restoring international security and trust must be based on the world as a prerequisite, and must not be limited by national prejudices. Any government's greatest success in establishing its national policy is insignificant compared to the victory gained by striving to avert the catastrophe that threatens today. The Duke added that he has no right to make any concrete suggestions, which must be left to those who have the power to guide all nations towards closer understanding. May God allow them to complete this great task in time, (Reuter, 8th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Deploy 20,000-30,000 More Soldiers from Taiwan to Invade Guangdong, Heavy Attack on Heshan Fails, Still Preparing for Second Provocation</h3>
<p>Hong Kong dispatch: Recently, the Japanese army in South China transferred 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers from Taiwan to Guangzhou. A portion of these troops were distributed from Guangzhou to the northeast, west, and three rivers area to increase defenses. At the same time, more than 10,000 troops concentrated in Shunde, Nanhai, and Xinhui, invading Heshan in multiple routes. Heshan is located in the southwest of Guangdong and holds strategic importance. By taking this, they can spy on Gaoming, encircle Zhaoqing, and control the waterways from Macau to the West River. Therefore, they have spared no effort in using a large number of troops for days, attacking Heshan City in three routes. The Chinese army considered this place a must-defend location and had already gathered forces, distributing them in various strategic points to meet the invading Japanese army with head-on blows. At the same time, 6,000 to 7,000 soldiers from Guangxi Province advanced along Guanping to Sanbu (Xinchang, Dihai, Changsha), with a part advancing to the Xinhui-Heshan highway to intercept the Japanese army invading westward from Xinhui. Since the 25th of last month, the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking Heshan City, one route along the Xinhui-Heshan road, with about 3,000 troops descending from Pingcangjing, and another landing at Danshui Estuary, peering into Heshan City from Kaiping. One route attacked the north of Heshan from Gulao and Shaping in Heshan territory, while another route detoured from Gulao to the Gaoyao-Gaoming highway, invading Gaoming. The battles on the above lines broke out simultaneously on the 25th. The battle in the northeast of Heshan was particularly fierce, with Heshan City changing hands several times. The military heart of this battle was in Jingang, Longyawei, and Kunlunjing in the northern suburbs of Heshan. Later, the Chinese reinforcements led by Deng Longguang and the Guangxi soldiers launched a major counterattack on the 30th, defeating the Japanese troops in the aforementioned areas in detail. By the 1st of this month, Japanese troops had disappeared from Heshan City. When a part of the Japanese army spied on the border of Gaoming from Gulao, the Chinese army gathered all its strength to meet the attack, and the main force of more than 3,000 Japanese troops was defeated in the Zhu Liuhe area. Since the Japanese army failed in the Heshan area and feared that the Chinese army would bypass Longkouwei along Jingang, they retreated hastily to Longkouwei without any intention of fighting. During the retreat, they bombed the Chinese army's pursuing troops with airplanes, and only then were they able to break through the encirclement and flee to Shaping. Currently, the Chinese army's frontline on the border of Heshan and Gaoming is solid, and the military strength is strong. The Japanese army is unlikely to invade again in the short term. In the battles of Zhu Liuhe, Kunlunjing, and Jingang, the Japanese army suffered more than 2,000 casualties. The remnants have retreated to Jiujiang, seemingly to replenish their forces.</p>
<p>Battle of Niowan Japanese Army Defeated</p>
<p>As for the Japanese army that invaded Heshan West via the Xinhui-Heshan Highway, it originally planned to join forces with the Japanese army in the Shaping area in Heshan, so that the Chinese army would be attacked from both the front and the rear. A certain division of the Chinese regular army had already been deployed there, and without waiting for the Japanese army to approach, they launched attacks on the Japanese army in Xinhui City. Fierce battles broke out on the 28th. On the 29th, a part of the Japanese army, about 2,000 people, was surrounded by Chinese troops in the Niowan area. The Japanese army struggled desperately, but was unable to break through. As a result, no fewer than 1,000 were defeated by the Chinese army, with hundreds killed and wounded. The Chinese army captured more than 20 Japanese soldiers and more than 40 war horses in this area. The remnants of the Japanese army are still stubbornly entrenched in Duwan to solidify the outer defense line of Xinhui City. As for the Jiangmen-Foshan road, after being injured in Jingang, a part of the Japanese army retreated to Haikou, crossed the river back to Jiujiang, and a part retreated to Tangxia in the southern section of the Jiangmen-Foshan road to await reinforcements.</p>
<p>Xinkai and Xinhe Roads Relaxed</p>
<p>The Japanese army invading Kaiping Danshui Estuary was intended as a containment force, with only 400 to 500 troops. After landing at Danshui Estuary, they divided and harassed Shenxianshi, Baimishi, Hegu, and Zhishan, attempting to attack the south gate of Heshan City. On the 25th, they approached the outskirts of the city via Baimitian and Hegu for the second time, and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army more than 12 li outside the south gate, holding out for a day and night. Later, after the Chinese army counterattacked, they fled to the shore. The situation on the Xinkai and Xinhe roads has since become relaxed. The atmosphere in Taishan Gongyi Port is also not as tense as it was yesterday. However, after the 29th of last month, after the Japanese army transferred from Taiwan to Guangzhou, a part of the troops (about two divisions) have been transferred to Rongqi and Guizhou in Shunde, preparing for a second provocation. As for the Japanese army defeated in Heshan and Xinhui in recent days, about 2,000 to 3,000 were killed and wounded. The wounded were transported by Japanese warships from Beijie to Japanese military hospitals near Guangzhou for treatment, while the dead were cremated on the spot in Beijie. The newly arrived Japanese soldiers (mostly from Taiwan and Northeast China) were all moved by this situation, and most of them harbored war-weariness. This kind of thinking will greatly affect the future of the Japanese army's operations. (May 3)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Continue to Bomb Chaozhou and Shantou, Japanese Aircraft Carrier Anchored in Nanao, Shantou Heavily Damaged by Bombing, Japanese Planes Chase and Attack Fleeing Civilians</h3>
<p>Shantou dispatch: From the 3rd of this month, the situation on the coast of Chaozhou and Shantou suddenly became tense. Garrison Commander Hua Zhenzhong, Shantou Mayor Wu Qi, and Police Chief Zhang Jiabin supervised the troops, guarding the coastal fortifications. On the one hand, they forced shops and factories to quickly move to the safe areas in the interior. On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese aircraft carrier Notoro anchored off Nanao, with another destroyer protecting it. Two cruisers, one being the Yubari, the flagship, anchored in the north and south ports of Chenghai County. Two destroyers anchored in Tuolin Bay, Raoping County. Two ships anchored outside Mayu Estuary in Shantou to Chaoyang Dahu. Regarding the Xiamen area, the Japanese army concentrated a division of troops, which could be transported to Chaozhou and Shantou at any time for combat. At 8 a.m. on the 4th, eight Japanese planes flew into the skies over Shantou City, dropping more than 20 bombs on Tongji Road, Zhijie, and Hengxiang. Shantou City opened fire, developing into an air-land battle. More than 40 civilian houses and warehouses were destroyed on Tongji Road, with dozens of people killed and wounded. Due to the collapse of houses, bodies have not been dug out, so the exact number is unknown. The Japanese planes then flew to Chao'an, wanting to take advantage of the spring tide to destroy the North Causeway, so that the water would flood the three counties. Fortunately, thanks to God's blessing, all five bombs fell at Yixi Station, damaging one truck and destroying multiple sections of the railway track. They then flew to Fengxi, dropping 11 bombs, destroying multiple sections of the railway track, with six people killed and wounded. The planes exited the sea through Jieyang. At 12 noon, eight more Japanese planes attacked Shantou for the second time, bombing at Niao Bridge, Tongji Bridge, and Guanghua Wharf. This area is a warehouse and factory district. More than 20 bombs were dropped at Guanghua Wharf. A match factory was destroyed. A garlic factory, a sauce and preserved plum factory, the Huainan Rice Industry Company's granary, and a salt factory were all destroyed, with 27 workers killed and many injured. Fifty houses collapsed. The planes then flew to the Chaozhou-Jieyang shipping dock, strafing the civilians gathered and waiting for boats to escape, lasting about an hour. More than 20 corpses were left on the dock. Everyone saw bullets raining down overhead, scrambling to escape, trampling and killing dozens of people. The Dayou and Dahua ships sailing from Shantou to Jieyang were caught up by Japanese planes midway. The Japanese planes then flew low and repeatedly bombed and strafed the defenseless refugees. The two ships rushed to the side of the houses, giving passengers time to escape. The Japanese planes dropped two bombs, both falling into the water. Passengers jumped into the water to escape, with heavy casualties, the number of which is unknown. The Jichang ship going to Donglong was also strafed by Japanese planes, killing four people and injuring ten on board on the spot. At 4 p.m., eight Japanese planes flew over again to scout various places. At this time, the city was filled with killing intent. The city and its suburbs were under military control, leaving only one escape route, allowing citizens to go to Sangpu Mountain in Chenghai. Citizens were eagerly seeking boats to Jiaoshi. The entire city has been evacuated. At night, there is not a single light. Those who remain in Shantou are all strong young men and volunteer teams, ready to engage in street fighting with the Japanese army at any time.</p>
<h3>Finances of Xikang Province After Establishment, Revenue Falls Short of Administrative and Construction Expenses, Relying Entirely on the Assistance of Sichuan Provincial Government and Central Government Subsidies</h3>
<p>Kangding dispatch: Xikang is a newly established province, and is also one of the border provinces receiving financial assistance from the central government. The financial status of the province is briefly recorded below, past and present.</p>
<p>During the heyday of Xikang under the Qing Dynasty, border funds were provided by the national treasury, which was extremely substantial. During Zhao Erfeng's era of border management, there were special expenses, with more than 4 million taels per year coming from household registration and allocations from Sichuan Province. There are still records to be found. Therefore, the army was paid double, giving them high salaries. Grain and cash were transported continuously. Even before the eighth year of the Republic [1919], Sichuan Province's aid money was more than one million taels per year. During the Republic period, Liu Wenhui was appointed to defend the border, fitting the caution of the battered border situation. At that time, because he also presided over Sichuan's administration, he decided to use the principle of Sichuan helping Xikang, transferring the income of Hongya and Mingshan counties to subsidize. Since the autumn of the 22nd year [1933], the special funds for border aid have stopped being allocated, and the tax revenue of each county has been returned to Sichuan Province. It relied solely on the taxes from more than ten desolate and poor counties in Xikang, and revenue was poured in. Therefore, Xikang's military and political expenses were extremely difficult at that time. The soldiers guarding the border relied only on miscellaneous grains and zanba to barely maintain their lives. All new undertakings were limited by funding and could not be carried out. In July of the 24th year [1935], the Xikang Provincial Establishment Committee was established in Ya'an, with a monthly subsidy of 10,000 yuan from the central government. The amount not covered still relied on military funding. Before long, the military funds of the 24th Army were allocated by the Sichuan-Xikang Pacification Commissioner's Office in a unified manner. At the same time, the monthly subsidy for the Establishment Committee was also increased to 15,000 yuan. In the 25th year [1936], the Establishment Committee moved to Kangding, and military and political affairs were clearly divided, with unified accounting for revenue and expenditure, and the local taxation was reorganized, the local tax bureau was reorganized, the financial and currency system was adjusted, and budgets and final accounts were strictly enforced, which was quite effective. Although Xikang's finances were on track at that time, the total income of Xikang was ultimately limited, and there was no financial support for the matters that needed to be addressed. Although the financial system was determined, the financial difficulties themselves could not be resolved. This is the general situation of Xikang's past finances (to be continued)</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Education Director Ma Yuanfang Talks About the Overall Picture of Education in Jiangsu Province After the War (Part 2), Changes in Educational Administrative Institutions in the Province and Counties, and Overview of the Work of Implementing War of Resistance Education</h3>
<p>Changes in County Educational Administrative Institutions</p>
<p>(2) Changes in county educational administrative institutions: Before the 26th year [1937], the education bureaus in various counties of the province were divided into five grades based on the amount of education funds. The internal organization was divided into three sections: general affairs, school education, and social education. In the first semester of the 27th year [1938], the Provincial Education Department formulated the "Measures for the Merger of Departments in Education Bureaus of Various Counties in Jiangsu Province," stipulating that if the actual amount of education funds received in each county is more than 80,000 yuan and most of the education undertakings in the county can be maintained as before, the education bureau can continue to exist, merging the internal affairs of the bureau and reducing the number of positions to implement administrative expenses. The internal affairs of the bureau are divided between the general affairs and education sections. If the education funds in each county are less than 80,000 yuan and most of the education undertakings are suspended, the original bureaus will be temporarily merged into the first section of the county government. As for the educational administrative organizations in the occupied areas, they have been completely destroyed. In the second half of the 27th year [1938], the Provincial Education Department specially re-established the educational administrative organizations in the occupied counties in order to restore the educational undertakings in the occupied areas. In view of the reality of inspecting, assessing, guiding, and supervising education in the area, county supervisors were established in each county (education bureaus or sections may still be established when necessary), working in the county government and handling educational matters throughout the county under the leadership of the county head. Educational committees are not established separately in each school district below the county level, and the district heads of each autonomous region are responsible for planning, promoting, and supervising education. If there are county primary schools already established in the district, the county government may order the principals to concurrently serve as educational committee members, taking on the responsibility of educational guidance in the district.</p>
<p>Various Measures in Educational Administration</p>
<p>(3) Measures in educational administration: In recent years, the important measures in educational administration in Jiangsu Province are approximately as follows: (1) Formulating the "Emergency Measures for Wartime Education in Jiangsu Province" and the "Wartime Custody Measures for Various Educational Institutions in Jiangsu Province," When Jiangsu Province became a war zone, planned measures should be taken in advance for educational institutions at all levels. Therefore, these two measures were formulated to give appropriate treatment to all educational undertakings. All provincial educational institutions in the province that have entered a state of suspension are uniformly sending personnel to take custody. (2) Holding graduation joint examinations: In August of the 27th year [1938], high schools, junior high schools, normal schools, and rural normal schools graduation joint examinations were held in separate districts. High school and junior high school graduation joint examinations were held in four districts: Lianshui, Siyang, Dongtai, and Xinghua. Normal school graduation joint examinations were held in three districts: Huaiyin, Taixian, and Muyang. Rural normal school graduation joint examinations were held in the Huaian district. (3) Formulating grade-level examination measures: formulating grade-level examination measures for county middle schools and private junior high schools in each county of the province to accommodate junior high school students from various secondary schools that were suspended during the war, and grade-level examination measures for various temporary middle schools to adjust the grades of junior high schools, senior high schools, normal schools, and rural normal schools. (4) Registering secondary school teachers and staff: Registering the teachers and staff of each secondary school, and introducing them to each school in the province and county separately to provide relief. (5) Sending personnel to supervise provincial and county educational institutions, strictly assessing their work performance, and promoting the education undertakings in the province and counties.</p>
<p>Intensifying the Implementation of Wartime Curriculum</p>
<p>In order to promote education for resistance and national construction, the provincial government has repeatedly ordered all primary and secondary schools in the province to intensify the implementation of the wartime curriculum. Regarding secondary schools, the outline of the national secondary school curriculum, the outline of special education for secondary schools, and other wartime secondary education laws and regulations promulgated by the ministry have been distributed to various schools for reference and implementation. Regarding primary schools, various wartime primary education laws and regulations, such as the outline of special education for primary schools promulgated by the ministry, have also been distributed to various primary schools for compliance. In addition, the Department issued the "Measures for Training Primary School Students in Five Subjects During the Anti-Japanese Period" and "Measures for Implementing Special Wartime Education in Primary and Secondary Schools in Various Counties," which were circulated to various primary and secondary schools for reference and implementation. Collecting teaching materials for resistance and national construction: All provincial secondary schools were ordered to organize subject teaching material research societies to collect teaching materials related to resistance and national construction, and report them to the Education Department for review and distribution to various schools for adoption.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Publishes Large Number of Popular Readings</h3>

<h3>Yesterday's May 9th National Humiliation: All Circles Mournfully Commemorate: Support National Policy, Persist to the End, to Achieve the Purpose of Atoning for Humiliation and Revitalization</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the May 9th National Humiliation. All circles in the city fasted for a day and stopped entertainment banquets to mournfully commemorate it. All circles supported the national policy and persisted to the end to achieve the purpose of atoning for humiliation and revitalization. In previous years, all circles flew flags at half-mast on this day for commemoration. However, this year, due to environmental difficulties, after joint consultation by various groups, it was decided not to fly flags temporarily. Relevant groups set off in different directions the day before to explain, but yesterday many shops on various roads still voluntarily flew flags at half-mast, which shows the citizens' deep commemoration of the May 9th National Humiliation.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Voluntary Flag-Raising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, those who voluntarily raised flags included shops on Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Zhizhi Road, Shili Road, and Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession, but they were persuaded to remove them by the patrol authorities. Until around 10:00 AM, Shunfa Shoe Store at Touji Bridge was persuaded to remove the flag hanging on the window by the Western patrol officer dispatched at the time, but soon the store re-hung the national flag on a high building, and the Western patrol officer went to persuade them again. The store then removed the flag again, and after the Western patrol officer left, they re-hung the national flag on the roof. Because they did not listen to the persuasion, the Western patrol officer arrested an employee of the store and took him to the patrol station. After questioning, he was released immediately. However, the Shunfa Shoe Store employee who was arrested by the patrol station was even more outraged, and when he returned to the store, he told people about the incident at the Rishenglou and other places, which caused listeners to gather, and passers-by such as Qi Dunbao also echoed the same. The Wang Cui and tin foil shops in the area then closed their doors one after another. Before long, large and small shops on the road closed their doors voluntarily, causing a rather serious situation for a time. The patrol authorities at the time also received the news and dispatched police cars and police officers to defend and maintain order. The road people gathered more and more, and the situation was very tense, causing traffic to be stopped. However, after persuasion by the authorities, it returned to its original state, and a small dispute ended.</p>
<p>As of midnight last night, it was learned that twenty-two people had been detained in the Laozha Patrol Station due to flag-raising disputes, and twenty-five national flags were still detained in the patrol station and had not been returned. Negotiations are underway.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Evaluation Meeting: Measures to Stabilize the Rice Market: Registration of Rice Storing Owners, Limited Price Sale, Many Sold in the Market Yesterday Morning, Situation Relaxed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss rice prices and crack down on speculation, and decided to set a price limit for rice and grain and plan to purchase foreign rice. Yesterday, the Shantou gang in the market accepted the advice and sold the No. 1 white rice, and the various gang Xian rice came out one after another, so the rice price stabilized accordingly. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Again to Stabilize Rice Prices</p>
<p>In order to stabilize rice prices and crack down on speculation, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee held its third committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the fourth floor of the Silk Industry Building on Hankou Road. Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Zhou Zhizhen, Pan Jibin, Huang Ruyuan, Shi Zufeng, Zhu Zhaoqi, Fu Qiankeng, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Ziyi, Shi Hongdong, and Yan Jiyun attended. Chen Ziyi was elected as the temporary chairman, and he first reported the purpose of the meeting and the amount of rice exceeding the price limit in the rice market.</p>
<p>Resolution: Price Limit</p>
<p>The discussion then began on the price limit case. It was decided that rice market transactions must comply with the price limit stipulated in the joint meeting of rice industry groups on the 5th of this month. If there is any exceeding the limit, the Market Management Committee should strictly implement it in accordance with the rules. Regarding the registration of rice storing owners, it was decided to formulate a form and issue a public announcement, publish it in the market, and notify various rice industry groups to inform their colleagues that all rice storing owners must fill out the form and register at the Rice Industry Association within the specified time limit for verification, otherwise it should be reported to the Concession for day-to-day processing. Regarding the proposal to invite a third party to participate in this committee, it was decided to send a letter to the two Concession authorities and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send personnel to participate for reference. Regarding the proposal to request the two Concession authorities to purchase rice and grain, it was decided to send a letter with specific suggestions to try to purchase rice and grain from various places for storage, in order to stabilize market prices.</p>
<p>Planning Ahead to Purchase Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The New Voice News reporter inquired about the rice industry leaders yesterday. According to reports, the city has more than 560,000 bags of grain reserves, and the rice shops have more than 300,000 bags, totaling about 800,000 bags of grain reserves in the city. Although there are continuous shipments from various producing areas, about 20,000 to 30,000 bags per day, the rice industry groups in the city have discussed once in case of need, and decided to obtain the consent of the two Concession authorities to order a huge amount of foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for relief in order to maintain the people's food. Moreover, the current price limit is equal to the selling price of foreign rice, and there will be no difficulties at that time. This issue is currently being studied separately by various rice industry groups, and the opinions will be compiled and reported to the Concession authorities and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for joint discussion.</p>
<p>People's Hearts Are Stable, Comply with Measures</p>
<p>Currently, because the rice market exceeds the price limit, large households have been hoarding, which once caused a chaotic state. Although the Rice Market Committee has repeatedly advised, it is still sold, and the major households are still observing their attitude. All the citizens of the city are worried about this, and they are buying and hiding from the rice shops to prevent accidents, so most of the smaller rice shops have sold out. Although the employees of the rice shops have tried their best to advise them not to scare each other, it is ineffective. Because the rice market has stabilized and the major households have sold, the people's hearts have become stable, and it is heard that the rice shop industry has decided to abide by the agreed measures, and the various committees will supervise the shop owners to do their best to deal with the current environment in order to maintain the overall situation, and not just focus on personal interests.</p>
<p>Hoarders Sell, Market Stabilizes</p>
<p>After the Bean Rice Market Management Committee has tried its best to advise the various firms and merchants to take care of the overall situation and not to speculate, yesterday morning in the market, the Shantou gang, including Tong Anxiangji, sold 3,000 bags of the No. 1 Changshu white rice that they had purchased and prepared to ship to Shantou in the market to maintain rice prices. However, it was stipulated that each buyer should not exceed 20 bags at most, and the market committee distributed them to the rice shops for the market, with a price of 15 yuan and a commission added separately. As for the Xian rice, a huge amount was also sold. Therefore, the market price has stabilized.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Handle Rice, Aiming to Profit</p>
<p>The Japanese side attempted to control the rice in its occupied areas, but because the rice-producing towns are controlled by guerrillas, this control plan is difficult to achieve. However, the national rice transported from the producing areas to Shanghai, in addition to paying exorbitant taxes, also often encounters obstacles. In addition, such as Yanhu's suspension of issuing rice and grain, and Changshu and Wuxi's restrictions on the sale of national rice. The Shanghai Maritime Company went to the producing areas to purchase in large quantities and transported them to Guangzhou, North China, and other places for sale.</p>
<p>Report the Process and Dredge Sources</p>
<p>Fu Qiankeng, the chairman of the Bean Rice Market Management Committee, will report the process of the third evaluation committee meeting to the various gang merchants and peddlers this morning, and advise them to try their best to dredge sources and purchase as much as possible to avoid panic among the Shanghai citizens. As for the evaluation committee, it plans to issue a notice today to inform all rice storing shop owners to register all village rice with the Bean Rice Industry Association from today, and will send letters to the two Concessions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Representatives and Police Authorities Discuss Banning Anti-Japanese Publications</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that representatives of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Consulate General held a discussion with the police authorities of the Public Concession yesterday (the 8th) morning regarding the Public Concession's system of Chinese groups, the wisdom and affection of Chongqing, anti-Japanese journalists, and publications. The two-hour discussion aimed to ban anti-Japanese groups and publications, and arrest anti-Japanese journalists. Those who participated in the meeting included Colonel Kanetani, the commander of the Japanese Military Police, Lieutenant Commander Mitsunobu, the director of the Navy's reporting department, Saka, the police chief of the Japanese Consulate, Bowen, the chief of the Public Concession Police Department, and Robertson, the chief of the Special Political Section of the Police Department. On May 6, the Police Department issued an order to all Chinese newspapers to submit all announcements and other documents related to the authorities for inspection before publication.</p>
<h3>Japanese Demands on the Public Works Department: Britain Cannot Agree: Even if Oppressed, Britain Will Assist in Resisting: The Issue of Returning the Northern District Will Be Discussed and Negotiated</h3>
<p>British Parliamentarians Express Urgent Concern: Reuters, 8th. A meeting was held in the British House of Commons recently. Conservative Party member Milner raised the issue of the Japanese demands on the Shanghai Public Works Department, saying that before a joint meeting is held between the treaty countries and China, discussions on changing the bureau or the land charter should not be tolerated. Conservative Party member Morell also said that when the Japanese army occupied the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, Britain should refuse to consider any changes, and the British should not be able to legally enjoy property in the above areas. Foreign Minister Butler replied to the above two questions together, saying that Foreign Minister Halifax has not received the full text of the Japanese declaration on greatly changing the status quo of the Public Concession, including the Shanghai Public Works Department. It is stable that the Japanese side has sent the same note to the British Ambassador in Tokyo and the Shanghai Public Works Department. The organization of the Shanghai Public Works Department is determined by the Land Charter, and any changes to the Charter will not take legal effect without the permission of the Chinese government. The British government cannot agree to this change until it has fully considered it with all other relevant parties. Milner asked again whether Britain would assist the bureau to resist the Japanese proposal if the Japanese side pressured the bureau to change its organization so that it would be under Japanese control. Butler replied, yes. The China Press reported that rumors that the Public Works Department and the Japanese authorities had agreed on the return of the area north of the Suzhou River to the full management of the Public Works Department yesterday (the 8th) were denied by a senior official of the Public Works Department. It is said that negotiations are still underway, but the trial has been going on for more than a year, and its final settlement has been delayed several times due to various demands from the Japanese side. One of the demands is to add Japanese people to high-ranking positions in the Hongkou Police Department, because the Japanese side claims that it holds sovereignty in the area. Although he expects that this problem cannot be solved soon, it seems that the negotiations have reached a decision stage last week. When reporters asked about the restoration of tram and bus services in the Northern and Eastern Districts, the official replied that the British Consulate had handled the matter and exerted pressure to start the business as soon as possible. He replied to another question that unless the Shanghai Consular Corps approves and instructs the Public Works Department to respond to the requirements of "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoquan, the Public Works Department will not do so.</p>
<h3>Reduced Number of Japanese Warships in Hangzhou Bay; Foreign Vessels Successively Sail to Wenzhou; More Than Ten Japanese Warships Still Have Not Departed; Chinese Coastal Troops Maintain Vigilance Without Relaxation</h3>
<p>According to sources in Zhejiang Province, ever since Japanese warships and aircraft repeatedly harassed the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang and concentrated a large number of warships in Hangzhou Bay, seemingly preparing to invade eastern Zhejiang, the situation had become tense. Recently, news received by the shipping industry indicated that although Japanese warships were frequently moving in the waters off Zhejiang, there were no unusual activities. However, Japanese aircraft continued to fly reconnaissance missions. A portion of the warships anchored in Hangzhou Bay had departed, leaving approximately ten warships currently anchored. The situation in eastern Zhejiang seemed to have eased slightly. However, Chinese coastal troops remained vigilant and had not relaxed their defenses.</p>
<p>Untrue Report of Moufu Being Detained in Wenzhou; The German vessel Moufu, belonging to the German firm Reith &amp; Co., departed from Shanghai yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, heading directly to Wenzhou. As this was the first voyage after the opening of the Zhenjiang River, the amount of passengers and cargo being carried was not particularly crowded. Around 6:00 PM, rumors suddenly spread in the shipping industry that the vessel had been detained for tax reasons. A reporter from Da Guang News Agency inquired with the company authorities that evening and confirmed that the rumors were completely untrue. If any accident had occurred during the voyage, a telegram would have been sent to Shanghai. Since the company had not received any telegram, it was presumed that the voyage was proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>Dingfang Telegraph Informs of Delayed Departure of Hana; The German vessel Hana, belonging to the German firm Far East Shipping Company, had successfully resumed its Shanghai-Dinghai route on the 3rd of this month. The second voyage was originally scheduled to depart Shanghai for Dinghai at 4:30 PM yesterday. All cargo had been cleared by customs and loaded on the 8th, and passengers had also boarded. However, when the vessel was about to set sail, the company suddenly received a telegram from Dinghai stating "departure delayed." Upon inquiring with the company authorities, it was reported that the military authorities in eastern Zhejiang had not yet completed the navigation procedures, resulting in the delay. However, it was expected to be resolved within the next few days. Currently, the vessel has refunded passenger tickets, but the cargo has not been unloaded.</p>
<p>Feikang and Dengsan Vessels Both Commence Operations; The British vessel Lisheng, belonging to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., arrived in Shanghai from Minwan, Wenzhou, the day before yesterday and departed Shanghai for Fuzhou yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, also stopping at Wan and Wenzhou, carrying passengers and cargo. The German vessel Feikang, belonging to Luhlin &amp; Co., is scheduled to resume its Shanghai-Wenzhou route for the first time today at 4:00 PM. The German vessel Haifu, belonging to Reith &amp; Co., is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou tomorrow.</p>
<p>Nanning Sails to Shanghai, Ender Delayed in Ou; The British vessel Nanning, belonging to Butterfield &amp; Swire Co., on the Shanghai-Hong Kong route, is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow after departing from Freeport Bay and Wenzhou. The Italian vessel Ender, belonging to the Italian China Company, was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai last night. However, according to a report from the company authorities at 8:00 PM last night, the vessel is currently stranded in Wenzhou. Therefore, the date of its return to Shanghai is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Libao Telegraphs Arrival This Morning; It is also learned that the Italian vessel Libao sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the morning of the 8th, which was previously unknown. In addition to the cargo loaded on the previous voyage from Wenzhou, the vessel did not carry any passengers. The vessel's company received a telegram from the vessel yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, stating that it had reached the Mopan waters at 3:00 PM and would reach the Wuli waters at 8:00 PM, anchoring overnight and entering the port the following morning.</p>
<p>German Vessels Expected to Regain Freedom Soon; According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Japanese warships have detained German, Italian, Portuguese, and Norwegian merchant ships in the Fujian and Zhejiang waters, totaling 25 vessels. Among them, Portuguese merchant ships are the most numerous. After repeated negotiations by the Portuguese Consul, the passengers and cargo were unloaded first, but the vessels remained under surveillance. The Portuguese Consul is currently continuing negotiations. It is now learned that the German and Italian ships detained include the Tianbao, Gaodeng, Liwuduo, Weijinde, and other five vessels. As a result of continuous negotiations by the German and Italian Consuls-General in Shanghai in recent days, the Liwuduo has already been released. Yesterday, rumors circulated in the shipping industry that the Gaodeng, Tianbao, Weijinde, and other four vessels would be released soon. Whether this is true remains to be investigated.</p>
<h3>The Mazuishi Giant Vessel's Maiden Voyage from the United States to Shanghai; Arriving This Afternoon; Departing for the Philippines Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The first giant vessel, "Rulammusk", of Mazuishi, which is the first in the industry, has completed its voyage between the Pacific and New York in the United States, and will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. When the vessel docks at the Gonghexing Wharf, it will be around 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. The vessel will only stay for one day and is scheduled to depart tomorrow (the 11th) afternoon after taking on passengers, heading to the Philippines and then to New York, USA, arriving on July 14th. This new vessel is the first giant vessel newly ordered by Mazuishi Shipping, with a deadweight of 9,200 tons and a length exceeding any other ship, at 482 feet. It has a sailing speed of 16 nautical miles per hour and a total capacity of 577,000 cubic feet. It has twelve first-class cabins, eight double rooms, and four single rooms. It will subsequently join the route between the Far East and the United States.</p>

<h3>Bombing of Foreign Property; Japanese Side Quibbles and Evades; Claims It Is Difficult to Distinguish Markings at Aircraft Altitude; Did Not Make Foreign Property a Main Target for Bombing</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, when the Japanese side hosted reporters yesterday (the 8th), one reporter asked, "Under what circumstances would the Japanese authorities be willing to take responsibility for bombing foreign property, as Chongqing has recently been bombed?" The Navy spokesman replied, "If it is a mistake or accidental bombing, the Japanese military is willing to take responsibility." The reporter then asked, "Are the Japanese authorities willing to take responsibility for intentional bombing?" The spokesman replied, "The Japanese Army and Navy never intentionally bomb foreign property."</p>
<p>The Japanese side is investigating incidents of bombing foreign property and has found no evidence of intentional bombing. Someone asked, "Apart from the Panay incident and other similar unfortunate incidents, are there any other cases where foreign property has been bombed and the Japanese side has been willing to take responsibility?" The spokesman replied, "As far as I remember, there have been no such incidents recently. There have been several times when foreign property has been bombed, and those who claimed it was intentional have been identified by the pilots who participated in the bombing. These differences of opinion have been resolved through diplomatic negotiations." Someone asked whether the Japanese side, in these negotiations, always held the position that the pilots could not have made a mistake. The spokesman replied that the Japanese side investigated all complaints received from those bombed and responded to the relevant consuls. It was difficult to distinguish foreign markings from the altitude at which bombs were dropped, and it was almost impossible to distinguish them during vertical flight. The maps provided by the various foreign consulates were copied and distributed to all bombing personnel. They carefully reviewed these maps before bombing, which clearly showed the locations of the various foreign properties. However, the Chinese anti-aircraft gun teams located near these foreign buildings were not marked on the map. When attacking anti-aircraft gun positions, unfortunate incidents may occur due to the close proximity. One reporter said that he had collected previous statements from the Japanese side and got the impression that the Japanese side did not actually admit responsibility for bombing foreign property. He also asked, based on his impression, whether Chinese artillery teams were usually located one or two miles away from foreign property, so that the destruction of foreign property could not be blamed on the proximity of the artillery teams. The spokesman replied that if the Chinese anti-aircraft gun teams were far away from foreign property, there would be no excuse, but he did not think the gun teams would be that far away. He also said that Japanese aircraft flying over Chongqing did not disperse their formations.</p>
<p>A reporter then asked how this could be reconciled with the claim that a detachment of Japanese aircraft attacked Chinese artillery teams. The spokesman replied that each detachment maintained its own formation and generally did not disperse. Japanese aircraft did not make the areas of Chongqing where foreign property was hit a main target for bombing. The spokesman then quoted a passage from the Japanese translation of international law, saying that it could not be considered that Chongqing was exempt from bombing.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Works Department; Maintaining Good Road Administration; Dividing the Settlement into Two Districts for Specialized Management; Important Roads Are Repaved with Sanhe Soil; Work Does Not Stop Due to Traffic Congestion or Expensive Materials</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, since the outbreak of the war, the situation in the Public Settlement has been abnormal, with the increase in vehicles and the high cost of building materials being the difficulties currently faced by the Roads Section of the Municipal Council Works Department. The congestion of traffic necessitates major repairs to the Public Settlement and the roads outside the settlement. The condition of some roads in the Western District is very poor, and it is sometimes difficult to repair them. Even when construction can begin, it is often delayed due to a shortage of materials.</p>
<p>Although Materials Are Expensive</p>
<p>the Works Department is still able to carry out its work and do its best to remedy the situation. To manage and inspect the roads, the Public Settlement is divided into two districts. One is west of Yu Qiaqing Road, including the Western District, managed by two engineers. The area east and north of Yu Qiaqing Road is included in the Eastern District, with regular inspectors constantly patrolling. If there is any damage to the road surface, it is immediately reported to the engineer for investigation and estimation of</p>
<p>Repair Costs</p>
<p>The report is submitted to the Works Department General Inspector. Once approved, repairs begin immediately. The west side of Yu Qiaqing Road, from Nanjing Road to the Racecourse, has already been rebuilt. Currently, Avenue Edward VII and Connaught Road are being repaired. Fuzhou Road and Beijing Road have a lot of damage, and a portion of them is being rebuilt. The Daxi Road between Yidingpan Road and Dunxin Road has also been rebuilt into a 30-foot-wide Sanhe soil road surface, to be able to handle</p>
<p>Double-Layered Automobiles</p>
<p>The east side of Yu Qiaqing Road south of the Xizang Road Bridge has been severely damaged by handcarts and is now being rebuilt. Other roads that will be started soon include several sections of Weihaiwei Road, such as the bend east of Seymour Road, which will be widened to 40 feet. The area near Chongqing Road will be widened by 18 feet, and the area near Mu'erwu Road will be widened by 11 feet. These will all be</p>
<p>Paved With Sanhe Soil</p>
<p>Road surface. Since traffic on these roads will not decrease, the old asphalt road surface will be removed and replaced with Sanhe soil. Therefore, most of the roads in the Public Settlement will eventually be paved with Sanhe soil. The damage to the roads in the Public Settlement is mostly caused by iron-wheeled handcarts, and the damage is particularly severe in the summer. When a handcart stops, its iron wheels sink into the road surface.</p>
<p>Leaving A Mark</p>
<p>As subsequent handcarts drive over it, it gradually deepens and soon needs to be repaired. It is mainly heavy trucks. The asphalt on the roads in the residential area is only for light traffic. In the past, food was transported by mountain boats, but now it is transported by roads in the Western District, resulting in the need for major repairs and the replacement of asphalt road surfaces with Sanhe soil. Therefore, old-fashioned handcarts and "new-style" heavy trucks seem to be the main difficulties in maintaining the roads of the Public Settlement in good condition.</p>
<p>Safety Movement Games; Opening Soon</p>
<p>The Committee for Promoting Safety in Walking, initiated by the Municipal Council, has been preparing in groups since deciding to hold a propaganda week from June 3rd to 9th. The committee has now printed various slogans and booklets and is conducting propaganda separately. Posters are being put up on utility poles, urging people not to walk on the roads and to follow the instructions of the police. Simple and important road regulations booklets are being issued to bicycle licensees. Warnings are being posted in automobile shops, reminding drivers to strictly observe traffic rules. At the same time, people are being sent to schools, teahouses, factories, and refugee camps to give lectures on the importance of safety in walking, in order to reduce the number of unfortunate accidents.</p>
<h3>North-China Daily News; Receives Threatening Letter; Claims to Be from the "Patriotic National Salvation Corps"; Demands a Change in Editorial Policy</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, the North-China Daily News received a letter claiming to be from the "Chinese Youth Patriotic National Salvation Corps," which stated, "If you do not correct your past mistakes, you will be considered traitors. In addition to being executed, your entire family will be exterminated." This is obviously one of the letters sent to the Chinese-language newspapers of various foreign firms in Shanghai, demanding that they change their anti-Japanese attitude. Similar letters have been sent to these newspapers before. The North-China Daily News is</p>
<p>Not A Chinese Newspaper</p>
<p>but it is included by these young people among the newspapers to be executed. The letter stated that two previous letters had been sent to the newspaper, demanding that they change their editorial policy. However, it</p>
<p>Expressed Regret</p>
<p>that the newspapers had ignored their letters. Therefore, the corps, with several thousand members, decided to make this "final" appeal. In the future, they must not publish political commentary, or the corps would implement its "legal judgment." The letter also stated, "Once your entire family's population, activities, and addresses have been investigated clearly, if you do not correct your past mistakes, you will be considered traitors. In addition to being executed, your entire family will be exterminated." The last phrase is</p>
<p>An Ancient Chinese Saying, referring not only to beheading, but also to confiscating property. It also stated, "You are all Chinese, and you cannot use the name of a foreign firm to insult your personality. We hope you will quickly change your ways. If you want to seek your own death, the time will come." The letter was sent on Sunday, but only the China Press and the North-China Daily News had received it by yesterday (the 8th) afternoon.</p>
<h3>Visit to Lin Kanghou</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>His heart for promoting education and saving the country came from the Reform Movement, but what he learned was naturally (Confucius said) (The Book of Songs says). So he gladly went to Japan to study education. After returning, he served as a teacher at Longmen Normal School, but he still believed that primary school was the foundation of national education. To change the law, it was necessary to popularize national education and run primary schools. He saw that the only driving force behind the wealth and strength of Germany and Japan was the popularization of national education. For this reason, he both advocated his ideas and presided over the affiliated primary school of Nanyang Public School (now Jiaotong University) in Xujiahui, implementing his ideas.</p>
<p>During the Qing Guangxu period, the national movement to redeem roads was in full swing, and private railways were springing up. Although the Sichuan-Han and Guangdong-Han railways had not been built despite fundraising, the Su and Zhejiang railways (now the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway) were built one after another. At that time, the authorities of the Su Railway decided not to use foreigners as the chief of traffic affairs, but they could not find suitable talent after searching everywhere. Someone thought of Mr. Lin.</p>
<p>The authorities sent someone to invite him to fill the position of chief of military affairs of the Su Railway. After he knew their intention, he said with a smile, "It is a joke to ask a cooper to build a house, and it is even more ridiculous to ask a teacher to manage the military. I am determined to run primary school education and hope to be engaged in education for the rest of my life."</p>
<p>After several rounds of persuasion by the people who came to invite him, Mr. Lin, who was full of sympathy, could not resist their persuasive words. He practiced the principle of being loyal to others and trustworthy to friends that Zeng Zi admired. He decided to work hard and do the job of chief of traffic affairs as a teacher. Before long, the Su and Zhejiang railways were nationalized and renamed the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Mr. Lin retired from the position of chief of traffic affairs.</p>
<p>When the Xinhua Savings Bank of Peiping was established, the authorities remembered that Mr. Lin was a hardworking and industrious person and "could learn and apply immediately and learn more when he felt insufficient." This increased their determination to urge Mr. Lin to go to work there. When he arrived at Xinhua Bank, he was just like an old banker. The Xinhua Bank authorities believed that Shanghai was the economic center of China, so they asked him to take up the post of manager of the Shanghai branch. Later, the Shanghai branch of Xinhua Bank was very trusted by the society, thanks to the efforts of Mr. Lin.</p>
<p>In the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Revolutionary Army approached Shanghai, and the Shanghai Political Council set up a committee to reorganize the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Lin was also appointed as a member of the committee and was elected as one of the chairman members. During the reorganization, he made many plans for reorganizing the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce. However, due to his responsibility of serving the community and the burden of military affairs, he resigned from his bank position.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association believed that Mr. Lin was familiar with banking business, treated people kindly, and knew that Mr. Lin often compared himself to a person stringing money, saying that people are all pearls, some big, some small, some bright, some dim. If they are placed randomly in a plate, they will not look beautiful. If they are arranged neatly and strung with a thread, each one will be lovable and appropriate. If there is a suitable connection in spirit between people, it can show love and sincerity. Without grievances, they will naturally cooperate fully. Therefore, they invited Mr. Lin to serve as the secretary-general of the association.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai First Special District Municipal Council added Chinese directors and committee members. Mr. Lin served as the education and works committee member. Later, he believed that education was even more important, so he specialized in education. He concurrently served as chairman, director, or supervisor of many industrial and commercial companies, and also participated in many partnerships, mostly to help others.</p>
<p>During the "January 28th" incident in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun Zhesheng was the head of the Executive Yuan, and he served as the permanent director of the Ministry of Finance, and then as the political director. Although the time was only one month, he had a glimpse of the overall picture of what should be promoted and reformed in the financial field. However, Mr. Lin believed that being an official was not for enjoying life, but for suffering. He still maintained his lifelong interest and politely told those who sought positions, "I cannot harm you." In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Lin was elected as the head of the Siamese inspection group and led dozens of members to Siam. Siam is a tropical place, and Mr. Lin worked tirelessly, doing his best to comfort the overseas Chinese and promote diplomatic relations. This has resulted in great gains in Sino-Siamese relations. Even today, the overseas Chinese in Siam still have a deep impression of Mr. Lin, a kind and amiable gentleman.</p>
<p>Last year, he was also elected as the Chinese employer representative at the 24th International Labour Conference and the Chinese representative at the 16th World Red Cross Conference. After being appointed by the National Government, he went abroad without hesitation. After the closing of the two conferences, he traveled briefly in Europe and the United States for six months, traveling 200,000 li and visiting dozens of countries, writing 100,000 words of notes. When he returned to China, his spirit was even more full than when he went abroad.</p>
<p>After a long conversation, because people who urged him to attend the meeting came to invite him frequently, I thanked Mr. Lin and said goodbye. (End)</p>
<h3>Stranded on Huote Island; Watching a Japanese Ship Sinking After Being Hit by Waves; Fifty to Sixty Crew Members All Rescued; The Ship That Sank Has Already Been Split in Two</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the 5,374-ton Japanese mail steamship Marika Maru, after running aground in heavy fog last Friday night off Huote Island (transliteration), 130 miles from Shanghai, was broken by huge waves and sank to the bottom of the sea, completely lost. The first to respond to the ship's distress call was the Preto (transliteration), captained by Edgar. The steamer sailed to the</p>
<p>Dangerous Location</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM on May 6, the broken ship was spotted. The captain stopped nearby to prepare to assist the crew of the Marika Maru. They seemed to have abandoned their ship and were sailing towards the Preto in lifeboats. Suddenly, two Japanese destroyers, Nos. 1 and 4, arrived at the scene. Captain Edgar then handed over the rescue work to the Japanese ships and sailed</p>
<p>Ahead</p>
<p>At that time, the Marika Maru was still stranded on the island, but it was undoubtedly about to sink after being hit by huge waves. Personnel from the Japanese Mail Steamship Company here received the news and chartered the tugboat Caroline Moller to sail to the scene of the accident in an attempt to carry out rescue work. When the Moller arrived at the island, the Marika Maru was still</p>
<p>Stranded On The Shore</p>
<p>with heavy damage, but the two Japanese destroyers were nowhere to be seen. All the crew members of the Marika Maru had returned to their ship. When they saw the Moller arriving, they abandoned the ship again and boarded the lifeboats, approaching the Moller. The group of fifty to sixty people then boarded the tugboat and escaped. While this rescue tugboat was berthed nearby, the Marika Maru split in two and gradually sank as everyone watched.</p>
<p>Wartime Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Losses and Wartime Accounting Settlement Methods; Mr. Xu Guanqun Argues That Each Industry Should Decide For Itself; Mr. Bei Zuyi Believes That This Is Not A Legal Issue</p>
<p>Since Accountant Xi Yushu petitioned the Ministry of Economic Affairs to list wartime losses of industrial and commercial enterprises as deferred assets, the Ministry approved the request, which has attracted close attention from the industrial and commercial sectors. Subsequently, according to the opinion of Accountant Pan Xulun, this wartime loss is purely a loss of consumption and has no asset effect. It should be deducted from the capital item to avoid falsely calculating profits and overestimating assets. Moreover, listing it as an asset would violate company regulations. As a result, opinions vary and there is no consensus. The settlement of industrial and commercial enterprises has no fixed rules. The opinions of Mr. Xu Guanqun and Mr. Bei Zuyi are recorded below.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's Opinion</p>
<p>Countless industrial and commercial enterprises have suffered huge losses. Accountant Xi filed a petition to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to list these losses as deferred assets in order to protect China's industrial and commercial enterprises. His intention is very commendable. The Ministry subsequently approved the petition and agreed to amortize it over ten years. If wartime losses are listed as deferred assets in the annual settlement, it seems to be well-founded. Moreover, since it can be amortized over the years, it is an asset. Accountant Pan's arguments are based on accounting principles and current company law, which are also accurate. In short, there should be extraordinary measures in extraordinary times. I believe that since Accountant Xi has the Ministry's approval, the industrial and commercial settlement can be used as the criterion in extraordinary times, which should be in line with the regulations. Accountant Pan's arguments are all based on legal principles, and the industrial and commercial settlement can also be based on this. In fact, there are settlements in various industries that go beyond the above two approaches. Take the pharmaceutical factory that I run as an example. It deals with wartime losses by setting up a separate reserve item. Because the characteristics of each industry are different, the results of the settlement are also different. The method of dealing with it is extremely difficult to unify. If the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, in order to sympathize with the difficulties of businessmen, allow each industry to decide on its settlement according to its convenience, the industrial revival will be greatly relied upon.</p>
<p>Mr. Bei's Opinion</p>
<p>There are three ways to deal with special losses in accounting: (1) to be borne by the income of the current period; (2) to be borne by the income of future periods; and (3) to be directly deducted from the capital. Since wartime losses cannot be borne by the income of the current period, and it is not convenient to directly deduct them from the capital, it may be advisable to temporarily list them as assets so that they can be amortized on a regular basis. Listing wartime losses as deferred assets is an accounting treatment issue, not a legal issue. If a company's wartime losses have exceeded one-third of its total capital, or its property is obviously insufficient to cover its debts, the directors and supervisors can convene a shareholders' meeting to discuss countermeasures or apply to the court to declare bankruptcy. However, even if a company suffers huge losses, if its earning capacity is still good and its surplus is not only enough to compensate for the losses but also has a surplus, it would be unwise to force it to end its business from the perspective of the national economy and government tax revenue. From the perspective of creditors, they are also unwilling to force the enterprise to end its business to avoid the risk of "dying with you." Therefore, the survival of the enterprise must be maintained within the possible scope.</p>

<h3>Tai Dequan Conspires with Accomplices to Extort Money from Aunt Through Letters; Initially Sending Threatening Letters Demanding 10,000 Yuan, Then Claiming to Be Kidnapped Was a Ruse; Both Perpetrators Apprehended and Punished Separately</h3>
<p>After the death of Zhang Bingxin, the owner of Wanxinchang Jewelry Store and a local resident, he left behind two concubines and a daughter: the elder concubine, Qin; the younger concubine, Dai; the daughter, Haoju; and an adopted son, Fubao. His estate, worth over 100,000 yuan, was legally analyzed by lawyer Shen Weihan. Recently, Zhang Qin and Zhang Dai suddenly received threatening letters from gangsters, bearing the name "Zhong," stating that the writer had a deep-seated feud with Zhang Bingxin and originally intended to take revenge by kidnapping Haoju, Zhang's biological daughter, and his real estate in the South City to vent his anger. Now, to settle the matter peacefully, they demanded 10,000 yuan in legal tender; otherwise, they would carry out their original plan. At the time, the Zhangs did not respond. However, on the 30th of last month, Zhang received a phone call stating that her nephew, Qin Dequan, had been kidnapped and taken to the Yangtze Hotel, demanding an immediate ransom of 10,000 yuan; otherwise, Qin would be sent to Hongkou, and Haoju would suffer the same fate. In desperation, Zhang reported the matter to the Laozha Police Station. Detective Chen Ruisheng investigated and found that the phone call to the Zhang family came from room 519 of the Yangtze Hotel. He stormed into the room and found only Qin Dequan inside.</p>
<p>There were no signs of kidnappers. He was taken to the police station. Qin confessed that he had incurred gambling debts and devised this scheme to extort 10,000 yuan to cover his losses. He also implicated Qin Dingsen as an accomplice. Qin Dingsen was apprehended and handed over to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide held a further hearing. Qin Dequan hired lawyer Tang Youwei, and Qin Dingsen hired lawyer Jin Xinmin to defend them. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, argued that the defendants'</p>
<p>malice was extreme and requested severe punishment. Both defendants confessed to the crime but blamed each other for initiating the scheme. After mutual arguments from both lawyers, Judge Feng announced the verdict: Qin Dequan was sentenced to one year and six months in prison, and Qin Dingsen was sentenced to one year in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Grand Funeral of Cao Bingsheng</h3>
<p>Following the tragic assassination of Cao Bingsheng, the Chief Inspector of the Political Department of the French Concession Police, on the 6th of this month, his funeral was held this afternoon with great solemnity. A procession started from the mortuary on Route Tenant de la Tour. A French policeman on a bicycle and four Chinese policemen led the way along Avenue Edward VII, Rue Chapsal, Rue Massenet, Avenue Joffre, Rue du Pere Froc, and Avenue Paulins, finally arriving at the Shanghai Funeral Parlor, where the coffin was temporarily placed, awaiting burial at a later date. Observers watched quietly, without a sound. Yesterday's pallbearers included Colonel Fabre, the Chief Medical Officer of the French Concession; Fabre, the Commander of the French Army Defense Headquarters in Shanghai; Chief Inspector Elphege and Deputy Chief Inspector Liang Bingjun; Godebert, the head of the French Volunteer Corps; Davis, the Inspector-General of the French Concession Special Police; Laurance, the head of the French Concession Fire Department; representatives from the French Navy and the French Municipal Council; senior officials from the French Concession Police; district chiefs; representatives from various departments; representatives from the Public Concession Police; and representatives from the French Army and Navy in Shanghai. The coffin was guarded by twenty special policemen from the French Concession Police, armed with rifles. Following them were the French Concession Police band, two platoons of Vietnamese police, and one platoon of Russian police, forming an extremely grand and mournful procession. Those who sent wreaths that day included the French Ambassador, the French Consul-General, the Director-General of the French Municipal Council Police, Fabre, the Public Concession Police, the President of the Second Special District Court, the French Army Headquarters in Shanghai, and various substations of the French Concession Police, too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>It is noted that Cao graduated from Xuhui Middle School and was always at the top of his class, which is still fondly remembered by teachers and students. He was very devoted to his wife after marrying Miss Sun. Therefore, Madam Sun Cao personally wrote an article and placed it in the coffin, mourning Mr. Cao. Madam Sun is a bright student in Qingxin Girls' Middle School, so grief is overflowing on paper in her text. The text is recorded as follows: "My deceased husband, Bingsheng, the tears in your wife's eyes are as bright as crystal. It is a pity that your love for me was not exhausted, and you sacrificed for the country too early. Only the day of final victory will be the time your wife follows her husband. You were thirty, and I am twenty-six. I should have died with you in the same year, month, day, and hour. You are spiritually immortal, and my jade body is not yet decayed. Your loving wife, Xu Ying, cries and writes."</p>

<h3>Extorting a Bicycle Shop, Four Criminals Arrested and To Be Sent to Court Today</h3>
<p>At around 2:50 PM on the day before yesterday (the 8th), Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police, along with officers from the Chengdu Road Police Station, arrested four extortionists at the Dasanyuan Cantonese restaurant on the second floor of 15 Yujiaqing Road. The four were identified as Li Yulin, 23, from Pudong; Chen Quangen, 28, from Chongming; and Zhang Genfa, 18, from Chongming. The gang had previously sent a letter to the Dayu Bicycle Shop on Jules Ferry Road, demanding 7,000 yuan under threat and arranging to meet at the French Park on the 6th to negotiate. After the shop owner reported the matter to the French Concession Police, detectives were dispatched in disguise to wait. However, the criminals did not dare to appear. On the following day (the 7th), another letter was received, rescheduling the meeting for 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the 8th at the Dasanyuan restaurant opposite the Great World. Upon receiving the report, the French Concession Police immediately sent detectives, together with officers from the Chengdu Road Police Station, to arrest them. They were taken to the French Concession Police Station for detention. After preliminary interrogation by the police chief, the facts were confirmed, and the criminals will be sent to the Second Special Court today for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Embezzling Payment for Goods, Sentenced to Eight Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Lan Caizhi, a Cantonese man and the owner of the business department of Fuan Department Store at 8 Jing'an Temple Road, was found to have embezzled 446 yuan from the Xianghe Tobacco and Paper Shop on Avenue Joffre on the 28th of last month. Xianghe Tobacco had ordered two cases of 2nd Opium Brand cigarettes at 446 yuan, paying 346 yuan upfront and promising the remaining 100 yuan upon delivery. However, Xianghe Tobacco never received the goods. When they inquired of Mr. Lan, they found that the remaining funds had been misappropriated by Mr. Lan. The money went to a Caojiadu gambling den. The incident was discovered by the manager of Fuan Company. The New Gate Police Station was contacted. The New Gate police sent an officer to arrest Mr. Lan. Investigations found that Mr. Lan had used the same tactics to embezzle 512 yuan from the Qiantaixin Tobacco and Paper Shop on New Gate Road. He was handed over to the court for interrogation and detention. The case was tried in court yesterday morning and the facts were shown clearly by the judge. Lan Caizhi was sentenced to eight months imprisonment for embezzlement of materials held during business operation.</p>
<h3>Workers of the Great China Shipbuilding Factory Detained, Suspected of Arson</h3>
<p>Pudong Motorboats Thrown with Grenades and Burned, Fifteen Workers Detained for Interrogation</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the workers detained by the Great China Shipbuilding Factory in Dinghai, new developments have emerged. According to workers at the factory, fifteen workers from Jiangbei have been detained by the Japanese army at the factory and sent to Hongkou, their fate unknown. The incident is said to be more serious than previously reported. On the afternoon of the 6th, someone threw a large amount of sulfur at more than thirty motorboats moored by the river at the factory, setting them on fire. Three motorboats caught fire and were destroyed. Two hand grenades were found in another motorboat. The sailors on board quickly threw them into the river, preventing them from exploding. After the incident, the Japanese side, noting that the factory faces the river and is surrounded by police lines on all sides, suspected that dangerous elements had infiltrated the factory. All workers were detained for about thirty hours, stripped of their clothes, and thoroughly searched. They were given no food or drink. Two foremen were whipped. Finally, fifteen Jiangbei workers were forced to identify as suspects in the grenade throwing and arson, and they were detained for further investigation. The rest of the workers were then released.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Vienna Dance Hall, Sued for Fraud; Agreement Reached But Not Honored, Identity of Plaintiff Still Questionable</h3>
<p>Chi Zhenmin, who used to operate the Cathay Dance Hall and once managed the Sinah Dance Hall, and Zhao Zhongdi, the former head of the dance hostesses at the Cathay and Sinah Dance Halls, along with Xu Weizhou, the former manager of Sinah, were good friends through their shared work. In January of this year, Xu Weizhou introduced the transfer of the Vienna Garden Dance Hall on Dahua Road in West Shanghai to Pan Sanxing and others from the Ji Ji Company. After several rounds of negotiations, Chi Zhenmin,</p>
<p>representing the selling party's shareholders, and Ji Ji signed a preliminary agreement for the transfer. The price was 20,000 yuan in national currency, to be paid in two installments of 4,600 yuan by the buyer. Later, some of the original shareholders objected, claiming that Chi had no right to represent the sale. Although the buyer repeatedly negotiated with Chi, the guarantor Zhao Zhongdi, and the intermediary Xu Weizhou, they have been unable to take over the business, and the money paid has not been recovered. The buyer believes that the actions of Chi, Zhao, and Xu</p>
<p>constitute fraud and has filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court, requesting legal punishment. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo held a hearing. The defendants Zhao and Xu appeared in court with their lawyer, Le Junwei. Chi did not appear. Chi's wife hired lawyer Qian Zheng to appear in court, stating that Chi was unaware of the lawsuit and had left town on business, so he could not attend. The plaintiff, Cheng Tieyin, also did not appear in person. His lawyer</p>
<p>presented the indictment, stating that in January, Xu Weizhou told the plaintiff that the shareholders of Vienna had no intention of continuing the business and wanted to transfer it. At that time, Chi Zhenmin claimed to be the general manager of Vienna and had full authority to represent the sale. They agreed on a price of 20,000 yuan and signed a preliminary agreement on January 23, paying a deposit of 3,000 yuan, 600 yuan to repay debts, and 1,000 yuan for expenses, with the handover scheduled for three days later. However, the next day, lawyers Jiang and Jiang, representing certain shareholders,</p>
<p>objected to the transfer, claiming that Chi had no right to sell. When questioned, Chi claimed that the matter could be resolved. When the three-day period expired, the handover could not be completed. However, on February 17, Chi and others continued to collect another 2,300</p>
<p>five yuan from the plaintiff under the pretext of paying the dance hostesses, claiming that the handover would be completed after three days. However, the deadline passed without fulfillment. Negotiations have continued until now, with no hope of taking over the business, and the 6,000 yuan paid not being returned. Such fraud should be</p>
<p>unforgivable by law. Therefore, they request a trial and have submitted the preliminary agreement and receipts as evidence. Xu claimed that he only helped estimate the value and did not participate in the other matters. Zhao claimed that the buyer was Pan Sanxing of Ji Ji Company and had nothing to do with Cheng. The court stated that the case required further investigation and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Li Yongkuan and Sons Case, Continued Hearing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Sick in Prison, Case Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>The notorious salt smuggler Li Yongkuan from Anhui, along with his second son Li Jiazhou and youngest son Li Bihua, had previously gathered bandits to commit murder and robbery, sparing nothing. They forcibly abducted women She Yuexian and Lin Xiuhua and forcibly married them to his second son Jiazhou and youngest son Bihua. Last year, they brought Lin and She to Shanghai, renting a house at No. 11 in the middle section of Ciyou Road in Xujiahui, West Shanghai. They locked Lin and She in the house and sent people to guard them, not allowing them any freedom. Until the morning of December 10 last year, Lin and She were able to escape and seek refuge at the Catholic Church's Sacred Mother's Convent,</p>
<p>requesting assistance. After the convent took them in and learned the details, they reported the matter to the French Concession Police, who dispatched officers to arrest Li and his sons. Stolen items, such as gold bracelets and gold rings from the Lin and She families, were found in the Li's residence. After investigation by the French Concession Police, the case was transferred to the Second Special District Court for prosecution according to law. Later, due to jurisdictional issues, the Second Special District Court requested the Third Branch of the High Court to transfer the case to the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Shanghai High Court, which designated the Second Special District Court to handle the trial.</p>
<p>Previous court hearings have been reported in detail. This case was continued yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Defendant Li Yongkuan was unable to appear due to illness in detention, so only his sons Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua appeared. The plaintiffs, Lin and She, also appeared with their lawyer, recounting the dates of the robberies, their forced marriages, and the three robberies in their homes in vivid detail. When questioned, defendants Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua vehemently denied the robbery and murder, claiming that the marriages were arranged by the parents of both parties. The court also summoned Li Yongkuan's mistress, Li Yao, to court. She was informed that her previous request for bail for Li Yongkuan had been denied due to the seriousness of the case.</p>
<p>Bail cannot be given, and he is currently detained in the detention center. He has been denied visitation. She can visit him, and if he is seriously ill, there are doctors in the detention center to treat him. Ms. Li said that her husband had first suffered from typhoid fever and now was coughing up blood and severely ill. She also brought out contradictory evidence, saying that the gold ring had been pawned by her son-in-law Zhang, but she could not answer what his name was. Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua were also unable to provide the surname of their brother-in-law. At this point, the court stated that the case required further investigation. It was adjourned to May 23 for another hearing, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Gang of Thieves Conspiring Illegal Activities, All Caught in One Sweep</h3>
<p>Related to the Mazaki Road Robbery, Interrogation Completed, Awaiting Investigation</p>
<p>Chinese detectives Li Yinmin, Chen Jinsheng, and Wang Qishan from the New Gate Detention Center learned that a large group of bandits were feasting and plotting illegal activities at a hotel at 98 Burton Road. They coordinated with Western detectives and secretly went to the location yesterday afternoon, arresting eleven bandits from Jiangbei: Chen Youfa, Zhang Jinbiao (also known as Sanguozi), Jiang Jinlin, Guo Peiju, Zhang Qilian, Zhang Ganyuan, Li Xu, and others. A handgun and three bullets were found on Chen Youfa. Zhang Jinbiao then led Chinese and Western detectives to No. 97 opposite, where they apprehended Zhang Guozhen, Zhang Zhengming, and Zhang Zhang. Another handgun and six bullets were found in the attic. They then went to a leather shed on Mazaki Road and Room 21 of the Huning Hotel on Kenon Road, arresting five accomplices: Dong Xiaowuzi, Sun Jincai, Guan Zhang, Chen Bingsan, and Wang Zishan. They were all taken to the detention center. It was discovered that these individuals were responsible for the attempted armed robbery of the Xieyu Transportation Company at 19 Mazaki Road on the 27th of last month. The officers reported to police, and a detective shot and killed one bandit. The suspects were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhu Zhishan, presented the case and requested a postponement of</p>
<p>the detention to continue the investigation. After Judge Xiao questioned each defendant one by one, he approved the detention for fourteen days before another hearing.</p>

<p>At the Guangji Theater at the intersection of Edward Road and Chengdu Road, during the 9:00 PM showing of the fourth episode of "Burning the Red Lotus Temple" the night before (the 8th), the audience was extremely crowded. An old man was unable to purchase a ticket. Something happened</p>
<p>with Checker X, who was violent and wanted to drag the old man into the room. After much argument, they parted unhappily. However, after the old man left, the checker was still not finished. Some spectators were angry. The checker and his colleagues dragged the two spectators into the office, wanted to give them a hard time and even closed the iron gate, not allowing anyone out. The entire audience became furious, immediately smashed the glass advertising signs in the theater, and even wanted to destroy the large glass window at the entrance. Seeing the situation was bad, the theater opened the iron gate and released the two detained spectators. At that time, the police were informed and sent detectives to suppress the disturbance. The spectators dispersed, and the dispute was resolved.</p>

<p>Science and Life</p>
<h3>Science for Amateurs</h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>Most people think that science is the most profound and complex of all academic disciplines, and that it is impossible to grasp its intricacies without studying at school under the guidance of a good teacher. This view is mistaken. In fact, science can be learned by anyone and is no different from other academic disciplines. The key is to find the right method and to have perseverance and determination. Many Europeans and Americans study science in their spare time as a form of recreation. Through persistent effort, they have achieved great accomplishments. The British Lubbock is one such example. Lubbock initially worked in a bank, then became a Member of Parliament. He never left the world of finance and politics, working diligently day and night. However, whenever he had a moment to spare, he would use scientific work to amuse himself. His research covered a wide range of fields, including geology, archaeology, botany, zoology, anthropology, and sociology, all of which he explored diligently and to which he made significant contributions. His most outstanding work was in microscopic anatomy, the classification of lower crustaceans, and experiments on the instincts of various insects. His achievements were in no way inferior to those of professional experts. Darwin once exclaimed, "I truly do not know where you find the time to make such contributions." Another example is Swinhoe, the British consul in China more than seventy years ago, who served in Zhenjiang, Ningbo, Shantou, and other places. In his spare time, he studied the mammals of China, constantly discovering new species. Many of his papers were published in the reports of the Zoological Society of London. He became famous as an authority on Chinese mammology, and even today, experts around the world still praise his work. The customs official La Touche devoted his spare time to the study of Chinese birds, tirelessly publishing many reports and eventually writing a specialized book on Chinese birds, which is popular in the world of ornithology. All of these individuals made good use of their spare time, engaged in noble hobbies, promoted the progress of learning, increased human knowledge, and ultimately achieved lasting fame. In our country, many people waste their time playing mahjong, going to theaters, or dancing, which harms their health and wastes their money. It is not worth it at all. It is hoped that people will learn from these examples and strive to improve themselves.</p>
<h3>Methods of Water Purification</h3>
<p>— Ze Nan</p>
<p>Water covers 70% of the Earth's surface. We cannot live without water in our daily lives, whether we drink it or use it. Even the human body is 70% water. This shows how important water is to human life.</p>
<p>Although there is so much water, it is not easy to obtain pure water. Everyone knows that seawater contains salt. River water and well water also contain minerals and other impurities. Even rainwater carries a lot of dust and bacteria when it falls from the sky. Therefore, after we collect natural water, we must first purify it by various methods before we can use it. There are many ways to purify water. Now, I will briefly discuss some of the major uses.</p>
<p>A. Water for Scientific and Industrial Use. In laboratories or factories, it is sometimes necessary to use relatively pure water. In particular, water containing minerals can damage boilers and make experiments inaccurate. Therefore, minerals must be removed first. The most common method is distillation, which involves evaporating the water into steam, leaving the impurities in the container. The steam is then passed through a condenser to convert it back into water. This method yields the purest water, but it is difficult to produce and very expensive.</p>
<p>B. Household Water. The water used in households must also be reasonably clean, and the bacteria in the water should be killed to make it suitable for drinking. The most common method of sterilization is to boil the water, which kills all the bacteria. Although boiled water still contains minerals, it is generally beneficial to human health. Sometimes we pass water through several layers of sand and charcoal to remove most of the impurities and some of the bacteria. This is the common method of sand filtration.</p>
<p>C. Urban Water. In modern metropolises, millions of residents rely on tap water. Therefore, the cleanliness of tap water is even more important to the health of residents. However, large amounts of water cannot be disinfected by distillation or boiling. The only way is to adopt the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Add alum to the water to cause a chemical reaction, forming a gelatinous suspension of aluminum hydroxide, which gradually combines with the impurities, bacteria, and coloring agents in the water and settles. This method is commonly used in households.</p>
<p>2. Filter the water that has been treated above through sand. Commonly, water filtration ponds are used, lined with several layers of fine and coarse sand. Some also use mechanical methods to filter the water very quickly. Some of the impurities in the water are filtered out by the sand, and some are decomposed by the gelatinous substances accumulated on the surface of the pond. If the first step is not taken, the effect is relatively weak if the water is slowly filtered through the pond.</p>
<p>3. Finally, pass chlorine or ozone into the water to kill the bacteria by using nascent oxygen. With this extra careful method, very clean water can be obtained.</p>
<p>Water softening method: That is, remove the sulfates and chlorides of calcium or magnesium contained in hard water. Chemical agents such as sodium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, and sodium aluminum silicate can be added to the water to allow these minerals to precipitate out on their own. Soft water can save soap and prevent damage to water containers. Although this method does not fall within the scope of water purification, it is briefly mentioned because it is very important for industrial and household water use.</p>
<h3>Concealed Wireless Device: Secretly Reporting Burglaries</h3>
<p>— Rong Li</p>
<p>Robbers often threaten their victims, making them raise their hands and forbidding them from moving, then calmly searching for valuables. The victims can only let them do as they please, with no recourse. Now, an inventor in Chicago has created a set of wireless devices that allow victims to send alarms even with their hands raised. The device is completely concealed inside the chest of the clothing. In the event of a robbery, simply take a breath to expand the chest, then use the chest strap to tighten and press the switch, which connects the circuit, and an automatic small transmitter immediately sends an alarm to the central receiving agency. The device is said to be designed specifically for bank clerks, cash escorts, and night watchmen.</p>
<h3>Talking About Multiple Births (II)</h3>
<p>— Liu Hanshi</p>
<p>In the twelfth issue of this publication, we have already discussed some examples of multiple births and their causes and biological explanations. Now we must further conduct statistical observations and genetic investigations.</p>
<p>According to expert research, women between the ages of thirty-five and forty are most likely to have multiple births, because this is the period when women's reproductive capacity is at its peak. According to the statistical research of Dr. Helin in Germany, there is one set of twins in every eighty births; one set of triplets in eighty squared (equals 6,400) births; one set of quadruplets in eighty cubed (equals 512,000) births; and one set of quintuplets in eighty to the fourth power (equals 40,960,000) births. This formula is now generally accepted.</p>
<p>However, Professor W. W. Grenlieh of the University of Colorado in the United States disagrees with Dr. Helin's calculation method. Based on his own research of 100 million birth records, he created a different formula. According to his statement, there is one set of twins in every eighty-seven births; one set of triplets in eighty-seven squared (equals 7,569) births; one set of quadruplets in eighty-seven cubed (equals 658,503) births; and similarly, one set of quintuplets in eighty-seven to the fourth power (equals 57,286,761) births. Now, let us use formulas to show the differences between the calculation methods of Helin and Grenlieh:</p>
<p>|                  | Twins        | Triplets        | Quadruplets     | Quintuplets      |</p>
<p>|------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|</p>
<p>| Helin's Method   | 80           | 6,400           | 512,000         | 40,960,000        |</p>
<p>| Grenlieh's Method| 87           | 7,569           | 658,503         | 57,286,761        |</p>
<p>| Difference       | 7            | 1,169           | 146,503         | 16,326,761       |</p>
<p>From the table above, the calculation methods of Helin and Grenlieh are not much different at the beginning, but the difference becomes larger and larger later on. At the fourth power, the difference is as large as 16,326,761 births. In other words, according to Helin's algorithm, the Canadian Dionne quintuplets could be produced once in only 40.96 million births, but according to Grenlieh's algorithm, there is a possibility of one set of quintuplets being produced in 57,286,761 births. With such rare opportunities, of course, the Dionne quintuplets are precious, and plus they are the same sex, which are of genetic research value, it is even more rare. At the same time, all five daughters are alive, no wonder they shocked the world.</p>
<p>According to genetics, multiple births have a bloodline genetic relationship. According to the results of the investigation, in the family of Madam Bing, who gave birth to one set of twins (two girls and one boy), one brother and one sister had both given birth to twins. Madam Bai, who gave birth to one set of quadruplets (four girls), also came from a family that had given birth to twins. As for Madam Dionne, who gave birth to quintuplets, there had also been twins in her maternal family. These are all useful records that can be used as good materials for studying human genetics. Readers, if you have the opportunity to meet twins, triplets, or preferably quintuplets, you can also visit their families to see if anyone has given birth to multiple births before. According to my prediction, there must have been. There is also one point: if readers discover that a family has given birth to quadruplets or quintuplets, they can also follow the foreign example and report to the central government to apply for a bonus. I think that at this high tide of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when people are needed, and multiple births are worthy of reward, the government will definitely be willing to pay a large bonus.</p>
<h3>Why Plants Need to Be Sparse</h3>
<p>— Tai Min</p>
<p>Everyone knows that if cotton or corn is planted too densely, the harvest may not be good. Similarly, trees grow very slowly in crowded conditions. To promote their growth, they must be thinned out like cotton or corn.</p>
<p>The attached diagram shows a cross-section of a pine tree. This tree grew in an overly dense state early in its life. Its diameter only grew to five inches in twenty-nine years. But after the forest in which it was located was thinned out, its diameter increased by seven inches in fifteen years. In other words, the rate of growth was two and a half times faster than before thinning.</p>
<p>Scientific Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Chasing Ghosts</h3>
<p>— He Shan</p>
<p>A farmer in a certain place raised horses and accumulated a lot of straw. Near the farmyard was a burial ground. At night, sounds of mournful wails were often heard, which terrified the residents, who believed it to be the crying of ghosts. At dusk, no one dared to pass through the area, and even those who lived nearby moved away. There was an old man who was naturally strong. One evening, he was returning home and passed by the area when he suddenly heard the sound coming from the straw pile. He was not afraid, and he wanted to get to the bottom of the strange noise, thinking that chasing ghosts in the dark was a heroic act. So he carried his lantern and followed the sound, entering the straw pile and pursuing it relentlessly. Suddenly, the light flickered, and he caught a glimpse of something like a small dog leaping in front of him. Upon closer inspection, it was a grass fox. It was still howling mournfully. He then realized that the so-called ghost cries were none other than this. From then on, the ghost cries stopped. He asked the farmer to clear the accumulated straw and found a hole in the ground underneath, with many discarded feathers and broken bones inside, which was the fox's usual dwelling place. The doubts and fears of the people were dispelled in one day. His efforts to seek truth and clarify the true picture is also the spirit of scientific research.</p>

<p>Artificial Modification of Animal Morphology</p>
<p>The morphology of various animals is passed down from generation to generation and generally does not undergo special changes. Now scientists are trying to change them artificially. Dr. V. C. Twotty of Stanford University in the United States has performed delicate surgery on amphibians like stone cages, resulting in several newts with fused limbs and several with unusually different head and eye positions. He recently transformed a purely brown newt into a spotted newt. This is another new contribution he has made to the scientific community. His modification method involves taking a piece of pigment cells from a common spotted species and transplanting it onto the embryo of a pure-colored species that is one-quarter of its length. He experimented with newts because this modification method can be continuously applied to them. His method is currently only applied to animals, but in the future, it may be applied to the pigments and morphology of the human body.</p>

<h3>The Value of Sexual Love and Spiritual Love in Married Life</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Some people say that the reason why couples get along well is because their temperaments are compatible, which leads to their spiritual integration. However, spiritual harmony only leads the love between the two parties into a state of complacency. If they want to maintain it permanently, they still need to coordinate in terms of inner desires. This point cannot be hidden from discerning people. As long as men and women with sharp observation skills can perceive it in their daily lives. For this reason, the pain felt by a patient with premature ejaculation and impotence is indeed beyond the imagination of outsiders.</p>
<p>A physiologically mature girl needs a partner of the opposite sex very much because her body is constantly stimulated. At this time, her blood is full, and she longs for spring love. Although she still does not know what sexual life is all about, she is generally very clear about her responsibility to bear children. However, if she marries an ignorant husband, the joy she gets from carnal desire can be said to be very little. At this time, if her husband is healthy and full of energy, then he can immediately lead his wife to a state of unparalleled joy, making her suddenly realize that marriage has its own precious value in the history of life, and then can make the feelings between husband and wife grow day by day, and realize the happy life of husband singing and wife following.</p>
<p>If the husband is a licentious man who indulges in masturbation and is addicted to sex before marriage, resulting in weakening of sexual function, then the wife will be greatly disappointed, and her heart will be hurt, which will reduce her love for you. If this continues, the tragedy of family breakdown will be inevitable sooner or later.</p>
<p>There is no more opportunity to study these obstacles to sexual life than that of doctors, so I especially advise patients to actively implement sexual endocrine therapy to completely cure them.</p>
<p>For stubborn and long-standing impotence, taking the testicular secretion preparation "Bu Jian Kang" can show very effective results. This preparation is fast and permanent, can make the mind clear, increase weight, and rejuvenate. I have used this preparation to treat the above symptoms, and have never encountered a case of failure in seven years. Therefore, this preparation has been praised by countless Chinese and Western doctors. Its female "Bu Jian Kang" functions to regulate menstruation and seeds, and is a holy medicine for gynecology.</p>
<h3>Secret Recipe for Relieving Cough and Treating Lungs</h3>
<p>— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Whether it is traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, coughs are difficult to treat. Therefore, lung diseases are more common than any infectious disease, and their mortality rate is indeed alarming. Therefore, people should not think that colds and coughs are minor illnesses and not treat them. If they unfortunately turn into lung disease due to the failure to treat the cough, then the patient should not be pessimistic. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as some doctors say. As long as you take care of yourself and get the right treatment, there is nothing mysterious about it. According to my experience, the medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" has a special effect on relieving coughs and treating the lungs. Even if the disease has progressed to the second or third stage with hemoptysis, taking this medicine can absolutely cure it. However, during the treatment period, you should rest and avoid labor, and take more nutritious food, so that the disease will be easier to cure. This is the condition for lung disease to be cured.</p>

<h3>Internal and External Treatment of Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>If you just want to rely on local surgery and general chemotherapy and membrane sterilization therapy, and do not think from reality, but want to cure gonorrhea, it is like climbing a ladder to pick the moon, which will never be realized. This is the reason why gonorrhea has failed in the past when using these therapies alone. Based on this reason, it is no wonder that Leukocytosisentherape, which increases white blood cells, can meet the world in the most novel and radical posture among many vulgar therapies. This is indeed unprecedented. The principle of increasing white blood cell therapy is as follows:</p>
<p>The so-called white blood cell therapy is to increase the number of white blood cells in the human body by using protein bodies to enhance the killing of lymphococci in the blood, and on the one hand, to eliminate inflammation of the urethra with a special yellow pigment. Therefore, all diseases in acute gonorrhea can be quickly cured, and chronic gonorrhea can also be quickly cured due to the fundamental elimination of lymphococci. This protein body yellow pigment combination has been tested on the spot by experts in internationally renowned large hospitals, proving that this special medicine for gonorrhea is unexpected. The name of this special medicine is "Ke Lin Nong", which will eliminate the pain of tens of millions of gonorrhea patients and restore their health. For all those who have acute and chronic gonorrhea, who have been nourished by taking other medicines, or who have not been cured by other surgical procedures, taking "Ke Lin Nong" can be guaranteed to be completely resolved in three to five weeks. For external use, you can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water", and women can use "Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. However, you can treat yourself at home according to the diagram and instructions, which is especially safe.</p>
<h3>Pornographic Books Can Inspire Masturbation</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>During the period when youth are sexually active, due to the hormones in the body, those with weak will are easily induced by erotic books and romantic novels, which inspires the motive for masturbation and promotes the main cause of underdevelopment and neurasthenia. In addition, after reading erotic books and pictures, bad phenomena remain in the brain, which leads to fantasy, and finally leads to the explosion of spermatorrhea. Therefore, young people during the developmental period should avoid ridiculous and obscene novels, books and paintings. Even those who have been harmed by erotic books and have exploded the above symptoms should seek effective and reliable treatments in addition to trying their best to recuperate. There is no reason not to completely cure them.</p>
<p>Now there is a patient named Cao Junmin, 19 years old, from Shaanxi (self-report)——When I was 16 years old, a friend gave me a erotic novel, which I read day and night, even forgetting to eat and drink. I was also induced by bad friends, so I indulged in the bad habit of masturbation to comfort myself. Three months later, I began to experience spermatorrhea. At first, it only happened two or three times a month, but later it gradually increased to one or two times a week. At this time, I realized the harm of masturbation. Although I tried hard to quit, it was completely ineffective. I seek treatment, etc. (Treatment process)——I ordered him to recuperate and quit masturbation, take "Nair's Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop spermatorrhea, and also take the testicular essence preparation for men "Bu Ti Kang" to nourish the deficiency. After two months of treatment, his health gradually recovered.</p>

<h3>Husband and Wife Without Children Due to Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Lively and smart children are the link between the love of husband and wife. Life feels empty if you reach a considerable age and still have no children. Therefore, all diseases that hinder reproductive function must be fundamentally resolved as early as possible to avoid regret. Taking gonorrhea as an example, its bad consequences often lead to the tragedy of childlessness, which causes the love that is as close as glue to disintegrate due to the barrenness of the knees, which is truly regrettable. And the wife is even more often subjected to unjustified grievances.</p>
<p>Although there are many symptoms of infertility caused by gonorrhea, none has a greater impact on our reproductive capacity than gonorrheal prostatitis. The reason is that prostatic fluid has the elements to nourish sperm, and its position in reproduction is second only to the testicles, and it can even be said to be in the same position as the testicles. Therefore, it must not be ignored. Because once the prostate stops its secretory function, it cannot nourish sperm. In addition, due to the contraction of scars during prostatitis and the blockage of glandular tubes, reproductive capacity is lacking, resulting in infertility. As for women, if gonorrhea has spread to the fallopian tubes, the fallopian tubes will become inflamed and blocked, and they will naturally be unable to conceive. Therefore, couples who have been married and know that they have gonorrhea must be treated at the same time to restore the ability to reproduce. Based on my experience of more than 20 years, the German Yang-Electric Therapy is most effective for the fundamental treatment of gonorrheal prostatitis, and "Ke Lin Nong" in internal medicine can indeed be called the holy medicine among internal medicines for gonorrhea. The reason is that "Ke Lin Nong" has the magical power to surround the gonorrheal lesions and devour the lymphococci with its bactericidal power. Therefore, gonorrheal prostatitis and female fallopian tube inflammation can be effective in a short period of time after taking it. It can also immediately restore secretory function, and the distress of couples who have lost children due to gonorrhea can be fundamentally eliminated. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 consultations are given every day, and each consultation costs only 5 jiao.</p>

<h3>Finance Supply and Demand are Balanced, Gold Market is Quiet, Only Five Yuan Difference All Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market was calm, with fluctuations of only five yuan throughout the day. Prices hovered around 2,130 yuan. Although a certain gold firm bought aggressively on behalf of clients and cash firms followed suit, another gold firm strongly supplied, and a certain bank also sold on behalf of outsiders, coupled with slight selling by securities firms and speculative buyers, the supply and demand were balanced, resulting in a mediocre situation. The result was a slight drop of one yuan. Trading was still active throughout the day, reaching 1,050 taels. There were no changes in jewelry gold prices at silver shops. The customs gold and Sino-British pure gold prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Slight Drop of One Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened relatively flat. Initially, a certain money exchange and silver shops each bought 50 taels at 2,132 yuan, one yuan higher than the closing price the previous night. After the opening, securities firms suddenly sold, and a certain bank also showed selling interest, causing the market to decline and fall into the 2,130 yuan range. At this time, a certain Yu firm took the opportunity to aggressively buy on behalf of South China, turning the situation from weak to stable. A certain gold firm bought 50 taels each from securities firms, silver shops, and other firms, all at 2,129 yuan. Subsequently, it bought another 50 taels from a certain bank at the same price. Later, a certain cash firm also followed suit and bought from a consultant, and a certain money exchange and a certain bank each sold 50 taels at 2,129 yuan as well. Soon, a certain gold firm came again and bought 50 taels from a certain bank at 2,129.5 yuan, and another 50 taels from a certain money exchange at 2,129 yuan. Later, a certain cash firm bought another 50 taels from a money exchange at 2,129.5 yuan. Shortly after, a certain gold firm bought 200 taels from other firms at 2,129 yuan. After that, the supply became scarce, and the price immediately rebounded to over 2,130 yuan. A certain gold firm bought another 50 taels from another firm at 2,132 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm still had appetite at 2,132 yuan, but sellers were hesitant, so no deals were made. Therefore, the midday closing price remained at 2,132 yuan. In the afternoon, silver shops also slightly bought, and a certain gold firm continued to search for purchases, causing the initial opening price to rise by one yuan. Silver shops and a certain gold firm bought a total of 100 taels from gold firms at 2,134 yuan. Later, as buyers' interest waned and money exchanges took advantage of the high prices to sell, the price fell back. Money exchanges sold 50 taels to silver shops at 2,130 yuan. At this time, a certain gold firm bought another 50 taels from a money exchange at 2,132 yuan. After that, money exchanges traded among themselves for 50 taels, with the evening closing price at 2,130 yuan. As a result, the closing price was one yuan lower than the previous day's evening closing price. The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was 2,135 yuan, and the buying price was 2,125 yuan. The spot gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no deals were made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang still quoted the original price of 216 yuan, while Xin Tong Hang quoted 214 yuan, with a buying price of 208 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Prices Also Unchanged</p>
<p>According to an eighth-day London dispatch, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at £7 8s 6d per ounce, resulting in the Central Bank of China's cash buying price also remaining unchanged at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold price also remained flat, at 2.3246 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Futures Stable with a Slight Loosening</h3>
<p>Although the foreign exchange market saw aggressive buying by the Bank of England (acting on behalf of Tianjin) and major foreign firms yesterday, the result was difficult to change as foreign firms such as HSBC were still willing to continuously supply. However, it was heard that the futures market was slightly looser in a stable manner due to heavier selling interest from foreign firms. Trading was quite sparse. The Hong Kong exchange rate was neither strong nor weak due to balanced supply and demand.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large contracts for both near and far months contracted by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold prices also remained unchanged. The exchange rates for British to American, British to Shanghai, and British to French were all flat. American to British remained flat, while American to Shanghai was down slightly by three points and American to French was up by 0.0625. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices for spot exchange rates at banks in the morning were 8 1/4 pence for British exchange and 16.0625 yuan for American exchange, with no changes compared to the previous night's closing prices. After the opening, although major foreign firms successively bought, there was a lack of change as the Bank of England and HSBC were still willing to supply. It was reported that foreign firms bought spot British gold from HSBC and McCallum at 8 1/4 pence. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, they remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced at a small 2.5 points, calculating to 6.75%. After this, foreign firms also bought spot American exchange from Hua Bi and a certain bank at 16.0625 yuan. Subsequently, the Bank of England also bought spot American exchange from a certain bank at 16.0625 yuan. Therefore, the market remained quite stable. Later, as fewer firms bought, the market became more sluggish. At this time, foreign firms were willing to supply Hong Kong exchange at 55.75 yuan, but as buyers hesitated, no transactions were heard. By midday, the spot selling prices for British and American exchange rates at banks were the same as the morning opening prices. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55.75 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, the Bank of England and foreign firms continued to buy, but the situation was difficult to change as foreign firms were still willing to supply. It was reported that the Bank of England and foreign firms successively bought spot British gold from Hua Bi and McCallum at 8 1/4 pence. Later, foreign firms Anda and Holland sold spot Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 55.75 yuan, and the situation remained unchanged. By the evening closing, the spot selling prices at banks were 8 1/4 pence for British exchange, 16.0625 yuan for American exchange, and 55.75 yuan for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, the closing prices for British, American, and Hong Kong exchange rates remained unchanged compared to the previous day's evening closing prices.</p>
<h3>Tianjin and Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rates Slightly Lower, British and American Exchange Rates Unchanged, Tianjin Counterfeit Money Slightly Rebounded</h3>

<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange settlements by foreign firms were still strong, and banks were eager to sell, with market prices remaining stable as before. The gold market opened, and supply and demand between gold firms and money exchanges was smooth, with narrow fluctuations. In the afternoon, silver shops took advantage of high prices to sell, blunting the upward momentum, resulting in a slight drop. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were in strong demand. British and American gold notes and Hong Kong notes were actively traded. Market prices declined slightly due to stable exchange rates and a loosening of forward contracts. Singapore notes saw slightly more interest and rose slightly. Recently, Japanese gold notes have seen rapid fluctuations, resulting in little trading. Korean notes trading was not active. Public association trading did not occur. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold notes decline by 2 fen, American gold notes decline by 2 li, Hong Kong notes decline by 2 li, and Singapore notes rise by 1 fen. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate and Interbank Lending Rate Both See Gradual Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange drafts rose slightly again. In the morning, the initial rate was still 50.05 yuan per thousand, but as demand increased, it gradually rose to 51 yuan. At noon, it retreated to 50.075 yuan, and there were no changes in the afternoon. It was slightly higher by 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate for money shops continued to rise by 1 fen, reversing the previous suspension of 1 jiao 1 fen.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Rebound and Fall</h3>
<p>According to an eighth-day London dispatch, the silver market saw few purchases from India and the general public, and sales from Citibank merchants, resulting in a flat market. After closing, the market situation was sluggish, with sellers quoting listed prices and buyers needing to bid 0.0625 lower. The large silver contracts for both near and far months contracted by 0.0625. According to the New York silver dispatch, American silver prices remained unchanged. According to the Calcutta silver dispatch, the Indian silver market was calm, with both current and forward prices declining by 1 anna.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Speculative Buyers Return to Buy, Yarn Prices Rise Despite Expectations of Decline, But Actual Demand Remains Sluggish, Total Sales Less Than 300 Bales</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, and the situation became somewhat calm. The reason is that the extent of the continuous decline in recent days has been very deep. Today's low price is 39 yuan lower than the peak price last week, which has attracted powerful buyers to buy in. As a result, speculative sentiment has stabilized slightly, and market prices have turned around and rebounded. This situation was also expected and is not surprising, because the decline was too severe, so there must have been a small rebound at one point. However, actual demand remains sluggish and shows no signs of development. In the afternoon, it was heard that Japanese yarn had rebounded after falling, and people's sentiment was raised. Trading in yarn certificates in the market suddenly became excited, and selling prices suddenly rose by 3-4 yuan. Inquiring about the market situation, generally large households are in a long position, and their will has never changed. They continue to buy in and hoard during periods of weakness and will not give up.</p>
<p>The current situation of yarn is still scattered and weak in the early morning opening. It is true that the sales of current yarn are not strong, and even fewer customers inquire. The opening price fell by 1 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 414 yuan. However, speculative buyers came to buy and maintain the certificate price, and the original price of the previous day was 406.5 yuan. The asking price of unpopular 20-count yarn is lower, but the bargaining price is very low, and people's sentiment is still depressed. The market gradually declined. Until the close, some small households sold the certificate price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for only 404.5 yuan, and the spot price of foreign yarn was 412 yuan. The afternoon opening was still flat, and suddenly turned upward, because Japanese yarn rose again, people's sentiment increased, the certificate started at 405 yuan, and the spot was still at 410 yuan. The closing certificate price was 409.5 yuan, and the spot price was 415 yuan. It is found that the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day is 1,560 bales, and the market price of Double Horse spot is flat, the certificate is up 2 yuan, Double Earth is up 3 yuan, Shepherd is up 1 yuan, and others are about the same as the previous day. Today, 675 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 375 pieces to Shantou, 580 pieces to Hong Kong, 190 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 95 pieces to Beihai. The amount of purchase by each gang is listed on the left: Same industry 2,295, Yunnan 100, Mainland 25, Hong Kong 50, totaling 1,560.</p>
<p>Japanese yarn fell in the early morning, and then rebounded in the afternoon. In fact, after days of falling sharply, it has already rebounded slightly. The market generally says that the Qingdao yarn market has increased. The morning price of 20-count Yueqin was 358 yuan, and it rebounded to 361 yuan in the afternoon. As a result, there was no major change compared with the previous day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant Ship Encounters Fog and Hits Reef, 3,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton Lost</h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the opening price of cotton in the New York cotton market was mixed, and industry players remained cautious, waiting for developments in Washington. However, the inventory of spot goods has been decreasing day by day, and the demand from various factories has been increasing day by day. Therefore, the near-term price rose by 7 pounds, while the far-term price fell by 6-7 pounds. The forecast for India rose by more than 1 rupee compared to the previous day, and Egypt fell by more than 10 pounds. Converted to legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 3 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by 5 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by 1 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade was very quiet due to the continuous rise in overseas cotton prices, and foreign cotton was hard to find. Yesterday, it was very quiet. Only Hong Tai ordered 700 pieces of Pingguo cotton at 62 yuan per piece, and Hefeng purchased 500 pieces of White Lock at a factory price of 77 yuan. A Japanese merchant ship carrying more than 3,000 pieces of Rangoon cotton from Yangon sank off the coast of Ningbo due to fog. It is said that more than 2,000 pieces of Rangoon cotton were ordered by a certain flower shop. The previous price was 62 yuan, and the current spot price on the market is 73-74 yuan. The flower shop's decision to lose money has already reached more than 100,000 yuan in profit calculation alone. The factory prices of cotton on the market yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>Raw Material Type Factory Price Including Tax</p>
<p>60-count Egyptian cotton high grade 104.60</p>
<p>Xia Sha packed flowers 80.00 Yong An Factory imported 1,000 pieces Transfer to Factory</p>

<p>Baba Cotton 84.75 Hong Run Hao imported 300 pieces Spot trade</p>
<p>White Lock 77.50 Shen Xin Second imported 500 pieces Spot trade</p>
<p>The business of local cotton is gradually developing. Chinese factories are very healthy, which has led to a slight increase in selling prices. The flower shops, in view of the interruption of the source of local cotton, have changed to operate foreign cotton trading. Therefore, in recent days, the purchase of Indian cotton has been very lively, the quantity scheduled by the flower number has been increasing day by day, the factories are also very eager to purchase spot goods, the source of Su North is more and more, and 1,005 bales of Tongzhou flowers arrived at the terminal. The current sales of cotton are listed below.</p>
<h3>Securities Telephone Shares Hit New High Price - 85 Yuan -</h3>
<p>The London Chinese Foreign Debt market prices on Monday, the eighth of this month, were generally stable with no changes. However, the British-German continued loans and British bond notes fell by half a pound, with a price of 66.5 pounds. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bonds rose by half a pound, with a price of 26 pounds. Domestic debt was suspended due to the 5-9 Memorial.</p>
<p>On the eighth day of the month (Monday), the London British Far East Companies stock market prices saw only the Ping Coal Mine stock rise by 9 pence, with a price of 18 shillings 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Industry Exchange's stock market prices saw little change, but the overall market sentiment was good. Tram shares were outstanding, and buyers continued to demand them. Rui Rong shares saw a large amount of trading, and a new high price of 7.9 yuan was seen. Telephone shares rose sharply to 85 yuan due to rumors of great development in their business. Jardine shares were weak due to the fall in yarn prices and selling by multiple long-term holders making profits, but the closing was stable and trading was at 18.5 yuan. The opening selling price of Reclamation shares was as low as 8 yuan, but after being strongly bought up, the final transaction was 8.05 yuan.</p>
<p>The rubber stock market was quite strong. Although buyers offered higher prices, there were few sellers. The UK rubber raw material inventory decreased by 1,210 tons last week, which can be said to be the largest decrease in recent months. It is estimated that the current inventory is only 67,320 tons.</p>
<h3>Land Rubber Shares Pay Dividends</h3>
<p>The board of directors of Land Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by Huatong Foreign Firm in this port, resolved yesterday to hold the 19th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on the 24th of this month. The dividend for this year (from February 1, 1938 to January 31, 1939) was also decided to be 2 fen of national currency per share.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Cloth Market Depressed, Speculation Disappears, Trading Sparse, Eastern Piece Goods Also Weak and Unable to Rise</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>The market is declining and trading is sparse, mainly because the military transportation on the southern ports has affected current sales, and it is feared that there will be no hope of a turnaround in the short term. Since the official denial of the rumors that the customs will issue regulations on the use of counterfeit money by the customs authorities, speculators have gradually disappeared, and customers only sell but do not buy, which has led to a slump in market prices. The off-season sales were originally deserted, and most of them had a large amount, so they were unable to handle this decline, so new transactions have been in a stagnant state in recent days, and the market is also lacking in changes. Yesterday, more than a dozen packages of blue peacock fine cloth from Subbei Dongtai Taizhou Bang were sold at 14.75 yuan, and more than 20 packages of Yihe light and heavy coarse cloth were sold. The wholesale shops on the street sold 30-40 packages of coarse cloth from the Jiangsu Zhejiang inland gang, and thousands of pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, pongee, linen yarn, and printed goods. The wholesale trade in this street is the most prosperous, and they are all fashionable light-colored cloth. The printed linen yarn and linen-spun non-fading flower cloth produced by Ying Shang Lun Chang Factory are selling surprisingly well, and 40-50 boxes are sent out every day, with no surplus. After Ying Shang Yihe Factory expanded the bleaching and dyeing department, it started selling the first product, a box of Chun bleaching cloth, for 15.70 yuan 7. Yesterday, it continued to open 100 boxes of the same brand of bleaching cloth, with a price of 16.60 yuan, which was sold by the wholesale number on Muk Street. More than 100 boxes of bleached cloth, colored cloth, pongee, and striped bleach have been shipped from the Tianjin Bang in Beilu. In recent days, the southwest Sichuan Yunnan Guizhou Bang have also continued to ship large quantities of standard cloth, colored cloth, floral cloth, and satin, but new transactions are very rare.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>Fine cloth and fine twill are affected by weak sales and individual households continue to sell at a loss, forming a weak and unable to rise. In the morning market, the lowest sales price of Longtou fine cloth spot goods was 13.60 yuan, and then rebounded to 13.80 yuan, which was 1-1.50 jiao lower than the previous day. Fine twill is affected by sluggish sales of colored twill, and the trend is very stagnant. Yanghe twill spot goods are 13 yuan, and Baobei has dropped to 12.25 yuan. Non-industry customers and the Tianjin gang have sold out a lot, but the fellow traders in this street are still optimistic about the mentality, so although the actual sales are low, the number of transactions continues to be around 1,000 pieces.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>The exports on the tenth day were 190 pieces to Tianjin, 30 pieces to Yantai, 20 pieces to Xiamen, 160 pieces to Hong Kong, 25 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 35 pieces to Beihai.</p>
<h3>Serge and Wool - No Significant Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were continued transactions of summer white goods, etc., which are needed for sales in the summer. Due to the environmental conditions, the demand from customers was not as strong as that of this street. Recently, only the West clothing gang had a stronger demand. Standard market prices are still mostly standing tall, while gray Serge and wool, regardless of stripes or plain, have no ups and downs due to balanced supply and demand. Both Chinese and foreign goods have considerable sales. Yesterday, ordinary Western goods gray Serge and wool were sold at 9.75 yuan per yard, the first grade of Chinese goods was 7.5 yuan, the second grade was 6.8 yuan, the first grade of Dong goods was 8 yuan, and the Henderson brand was sold at 7.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Shanghai Silk Reeling Industry to Go on the Market, and New Cocoons are About to Enter the Market, and Work Hard to Collect Cocoons in Guerrilla Areas, with Jiangyin Being the Most Welcomed by Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The most urgent and important problem for the Shanghai silk industry is raw materials. According to estimates of the current situation, silk mills in Shanghai consume more than 150,000 dan of dried cocoons each year. This year, since the so-called "Central China Company" wanted to prohibit the transport of dried cocoons to Shanghai and monopolize the cocoon banks in various towns, in an attempt to monopolize, the factories in Shanghai were deeply worried. Recently, the situation has eased slightly, because the cocoon banks in the four villages outside the city are mostly controlled by guerrillas. If "Central China" formally goes down to the village to collect cocoons, it will inevitably be attacked by the guerrillas. Therefore, under the discussion of the "Central China" Japanese puppet government, it was decided to temporarily abandon the cocoon banks outside the scope of influence, and let Chinese in name go down to the village to collect cocoons, transport them to the city, and then resell them to Central China. On the one hand, it was declared that Chinese and other cocoon merchants are allowed to freely set up lines to collect cocoons without hindrance, so the remaining cocoon merchants are very active. However, the cocoons collected, I heard, must be divided equally with "Central China", some say they can be transported to Shanghai, some say they absolutely cannot, and there are many rumors.</p>
<p>There are currently 37 silk mills in Shanghai. If there are really no raw materials transported to Shanghai, they will inevitably be forced to stop work. All factories are aware of this, so they openly discussed that at this time it is impossible to give a definite answer on everything. The result was that it was decided to first start renting lines in the guerrilla areas, and the issue of export will be determined at that time, that is, to see the facts and act accordingly. The cocoon line owners in the four villages, who are well aware of the situation, refuse to be used by "Central China", so most of them refuse to cooperate and go to Shanghai to sign lease contracts with various factories. The factory and the line work together. Due to environmental reasons, it is feared that various obstacles will occur, so the responsibility for all assets is borne entirely by the line owner. Now I will list the general packaging and baking prices on the market.</p>
<p>(1) Large-scale packaging and baking: From the collection of cocoons to the boarding of Jianglun, all military police donations, taxes, transportation costs, salary of the staff of the line, meals, etc. are the responsibility of the line owner. The price of packaging and baking per dan of dried cocoons ranges from 35 yuan to more than 40 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The line owner is only responsible for the cost of drying the cocoons and the costs of the workers, the miscellaneous expenses in the line, meals, etc., and all other issues are the responsibility of the customer. The price of packaging and baking per dan ranges from 20 yuan to more than 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the lines in Jiangyin are the most popular among manufacturers, because they are close to the Yangtze River and the exports are more convenient, so the rise and fall of the packaging and baking prices must be determined according to the current environment, which is three to four times higher than before the war.</p>
<p>In Yixing, recently, the Chinese and Japanese armies are engaged in fierce battles, and there is no certainty about the future of cocoon collection. I am afraid that there are more dangers in other places. (Xiang)</p>
<h3>Foreign Silk is Extremely Popular and Shanghai Silk Sales are Active</h3>
<p>The foreign silk market continued to rise yesterday. New York's near-term silk jumped 8 fen to open at 2.63 yuan, and the far-term silk rose 6 fen, which can be said to be extremely popular. The spot price of Japanese silk rose 7-8 fen, and Shanghai silk has not been opened for a long time. It opened yesterday at 2.46 yuan, which is equivalent to more than 1,900 yuan in Shanghai. The price of Chinese and Japanese grade A raw silk in the Lyon silk market each rose 6.5 francs, the price of grade B silk rose 2.5 francs, and the price of Guangdong silk rose 3 francs. Yokohama's spot price fell 5 yuan, and the far-term price rose 21 yuan.</p>
<p>The trading of the company in this port was relatively deserted, because the foreign firms limited the price, and the rise was slightly slow. The French company's route was very active. The B grade RR white factory price was 1,790 yuan, and Ren Chang, Da Chang, and Xin Fu each imported 80 dan. The sales of Ji Li, which is popular in the British and Indian markets, is also lively. It is estimated that Da Feng, Xin Da, and other foreign firms imported a total of 30 dan. The market price is rising.</p>
<p>On the ninth day, 373 pieces of lake silk and 50 tons of tea were transported to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices: Local and Visiting Merchants Faced Stagnation; Flour Market Stabilized; Imported Wheat Arrived Continuously, Significantly Impacting the Market</h3>
<p>The flour price surge has subsided, primarily because the No. 2 Flour Mill uniformly switched to a cash price of $4.55 per bag for all local merchants. Dealers in this area found the price too high, reducing their purchases, and sales in the Rongbang region remained stagnant. According to sources from the Beiyang area, the flour prices in Tianjin and Shanghai are currently comparable, but the risk of exchange rate fluctuations is deterring large-scale transportation. Mills, facing high costs and limited processing of foreign flour, see no need to compromise. Therefore, the market remains stable. The total volume of transactions for various flour brands was 35,000 to 36,000 bags. Aside from retail sales in the North and South, there was some interest from inland merchants. The price of No. 2 Flour Mill's product remained unchanged, although reports indicate slight variations in returned goods. The overall market situation has entered a state of fluctuation.</p>
<p>Exports: On the 10th, flour exports totaled 25,100 bags to Tianjin, 2,000 bags to Weihaiwei, and 11,300 bags to Xiamen. On the same day, 500 bags of bran were shipped to Xiamen and 400 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the anniversary of the May 9th National Humiliation Day, and the Miscellaneous Grains Association market was closed for the day. The wheat market has been significantly affected by the dumping of foreign wheat, leading to prolonged inactivity. Mills, having access to foreign wheat, are not purchasing local wheat on the market, only fulfilling door-to-door deliveries. Recently arrived Jiangbei wheat is being sold at lower prices due to its heavy mud content. It is said that high-quality wheat delivered to mills is priced at only $6.50 to $6.60, while the market price is still one or two dimes higher.</p>
<p>Imported wheat continues to arrive. The "Kai Qi Cheng Li Hao" (transliterated) ship, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived with 92,011 bags, as reported previously. The Hestralia, managed by Jardine Matheson, carrying over 7,000 tons of Australian wheat, arrived in Shanghai on the 8th and docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong, where unloading is underway. It is also reported that the Queen Victoria, also managed by Jardine Matheson, carrying over 8,000 tons of Australian wheat, is expected to arrive tomorrow (the 11th). Additionally, the Rlauduff and Rindebak, managed by Paw Ho Foreign Firm, are carrying large quantities of wheat from Australia to Shanghai and are expected to arrive in mid-month. The exact quantities will be reported later. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Rice Market Remains Unstable</h3>
<p>Domestic Rice: Yesterday, shipments from He Xia to Songjiang No. 1 and Donglun Baozi to Sutongbang totaled only 1,400 to 1,500 bags. The chaotic market situation remains unresolved. Because prices remain on the restricted line, Northern Japonica rice is not being sampled. Only Southern Japonica rice and thin rice are being traded, with prices quoted at $15. He Xia Songjiang thin rice is priced at $14.50 per load. However, since the strict price controls and fines were implemented, the restricted line has been maintained. Simultaneously, public sentiment has gradually stabilized, and purchasing power has declined. Therefore, the price of sharp rice, except for high-quality rice, which remains at $16, has decreased by a few cents. To stabilize the rice market, those in charge must take forceful measures. Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian remain scarce. Bian Yuan remains stable, with high-quality rice at $21 and market rice at $20.05. Yin Yuan has a load of Fengjing rice priced at $16.25.</p>
<p>Guest Xian Rice: After being absorbed by hoarders for several days, resulting in repeated price increases, large-scale transportation by guest merchants has been triggered. In the past two days, as many as 15,000 bags have been shipped from the Yangtze River by steamer. Hoarders are now taking a wait-and-see attitude, and local merchants are hesitant to continue purchasing in large quantities. Merchants are instead planning to sell off their existing stock while prices are high. As a result, the Guest Xian rice market has experienced a sudden drop of two to three dimes amidst active selling. Medium-grade rice is weakening, and high-quality rice is only down one or two dimes. The highest price quoted is still $14, with Nanjing market also quoting $14. However, sellers of exceptionally high-quality rice are unwilling to sell cheaply. Transactions have been limited due to hoarders halting their purchases, with less than 3,000 bags traded. Foreign rice is still priced at $19.10 to $19.20. International news reports vary, with the highest price reported at $20.05.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Significant Imports of Soybean Oil</h3>
<p>Yesterday, on the occasion of the May 5th Memorial, the miscellaneous grains market was closed for one day. However, soybean oil imports were quite strong, including 1,990 bags of beans from Shi Jin and 1,210 units of soybean oil from Yantai. Shipments from Qingdao included 2,300 units of blended oil and 1,900 cans of sesame oil.</p>
<p>Also, soybean exports: On the 9th, 36 tons were shipped to Columbus. On the 10th, 160 bags were shipped to Xiamen and 320 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Egg yolk and egg white: On the 9th, 598 tons were shipped to London. On the 10th, 47 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Batch of Taikoo Granulated Sugar Transacted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the London telegraphic report for raw white sugar showed a slight increase in the near term, with May at 8 shillings and 5 pence. The forward market was slightly weaker, with August at 7 shillings and 4 pence and November at 6 shillings, 2 pence and 75. Dutch prices remained unchanged. Hong Kong reported an increase to HK$11.50 per bag, equivalent to $21.20 in Shanghai. Therefore, the Shanghai market is slightly firmer. The Association quoted $24 for raw white sugar, with current goods at the local warehouse up one dime to $28.40, and $28.20 at the outer warehouse. Due to continued releases from bonded warehouses, the market is weaker, with 704 bags released at $20, and goods arriving on the 13th at $20.20 for 300 bags. Dutch red sugar and local refined white sugar remained unchanged. Taikoo granulated sugar was down slightly by one to five cents, with West Warehouse's B mark at $28.10, CW mark at $27.95, CX mark at $27.80, and DY mark at $27.50 for 100 bags. HX mark was at $27.50, and H mark red sugar was at $19.50. Taikoo Company quoted HK$11.5 for B mark, HK$11.4 for CW mark, HK$11.3 for DY mark, and HK$11.2 for HX mark, with a total of 2,500 bags transacted. Domestic sugar remains weak due to slow sales, with only a few hundred bags of mixed-road foreign sugar offered at $18.20 and dozens of bags of Huizhou white sugar at $14.50.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Glutinous Rice Branches Decline</h3>
<p>Glutinous rice branches have softened due to recent decreased sales. Merchants are hesitant to make purchases, leading to reduced bids. It is reported that ordinary goods are being offered at $137, while higher-quality goods are selling for $150, with a settled price of $140, a decrease of $10 compared to the highest price.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Shantou Shrimp Tails and Razor Clams, New Goods Test the Market</h3>
<p>Shantou shrimp tails and razor clams have been inactive for a long time due to the seasonal gap. New goods from early summer have recently arrived and were sold quickly the day before yesterday. Dragon whiskers shrimp tails are priced at $140, and five pieces of Huaihe locust jerky are priced at $50. These are initial market tests, and more goods are expected to arrive soon.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Abalone Shells in Short Supply, Prices Expected to Rise</h3>
<p>Abalone shells, the outer hard shell of abalone, have seen many low-quality sources since the war, with the lowest price being only $12 to $13 per picul. When in short supply, the price has risen to over $20. Recently, the market has been almost sold out. Domestic products, such as those from Qiongzhou, are usually plentiful, but transportation difficulties have increased costs due to detours through Hong Kong. Therefore, the current market price is $30.</p>
<h3>Coal: Henan White Coal Sold as Old Stock; Indian Coal Arrives, Over 7,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Henan white coal business is still booming, with demand from restaurants, so the market remains stable. Yesterday, a certain firm offered Henan mixed coal at $41 per ton and lump coal at $44 per ton, ex-Pudong warehouse, with additional charges for handling. However, most of this white coal is pre-war stock from Hanyang warehouse, with a dull yellow color, and not as hard and heat-resistant as new coal.</p>
<p>More Indian coal has arrived in Shanghai. The Nyl adys Moller, managed by Jardine Matheson, carrying 7,080 tons of coal from Shankargarg, is expected to arrive tomorrow (the 11th).</p>
<h3>Metals: Narrow Iron Market Active</h3>
<p>The metals market has been good recently due to sales in Tianjin. 200-pound American narrow iron has seen a recent resurgence, with as many as six or seven hundred boxes offered on the market. Buyers are mostly from local can factories, with some interest from Qingdao, Yantai, and Tianjin. Sales to Fujian, usually strong, have been affected by Japanese bombing, which has disrupted procurement. Overseas prices are rising (recently selling for 65 gold dollars per ton, up 3 gold dollars), so local prices are at $43 for mixed goods.</p>

<h3>Strike First</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The military alliance between Germany and Italy is about to be signed. The process, impact, and future consequences of this event have been reported in detail by foreign news agencies, and Chinese newspapers will surely have extensive commentary. Therefore, I do not intend to discuss these aspects here, but rather to briefly share some thoughts that this matter has triggered in me.</p>
<p>I believe that Germany and Italy, particularly Germany, are skilled competitors. They understand the principle of "strike first, control the game; strike later, be controlled." We see that since the troubles in Central Europe, haven't they emerged victorious in every crucial change? While there are many reasons for their success, their quick decision-making and swift execution, like skilled athletes in a competition, constantly striving to be first, are undoubtedly significant factors. The formation of this military alliance, though long in the making, is now a natural culmination, reaching a certain stage. Conversely, looking at the much-publicized, seemingly imminent anti-aggression organizations, or the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance, they remain in a state of hesitant distance. We cannot help but say that, in this comparison, Germany and Italy have taken the lead.</p>
<p>By taking the lead, I am in control and others are guests. I can wait at ease and take what I want, while others must hastily respond, falling into my trap. Since China adopted the philosophy of "think thrice before acting," or at least "think twice," society and even government authorities have historically valued slow, circuitous, and dilatory approaches. They call it prudence and consideration, but in reality, it is often just laziness. Compared to the Westerners' courage and progress, they lag far behind. Westerners even rush to take the lead, even if it means making mistakes, saying that it is better than missing an opportunity by not acting. They truly understand the essence of taking the lead, and Germany and Italy are their representatives.</p>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance against Japan, China has finally begun to change this bad habit and has embarked on the path to victory by taking the lead. We see that the aggressor initially did not want to start a full-scale war, but only wanted to achieve its goals through coercion and temptation. China, however, resolutely resisted, forcing the aggressor to use all its resources to cope. Even now, this situation persists: the aggressor wants to maintain its existing gains and negotiate peace, while China still wants to resist to the end and expel the aggressor from its territory. China is proactive, and the aggressor is passive. The situation is clear, and China has taken the lead.</p>
<p>Taking the lead guarantees victory. China can certainly be confident in this, and even if it takes a long time, what does it matter!</p>
<h3>Sleeping Pills</h3>
<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>Before I set off, I received a letter from Teacher Xu, asking me to buy a bottle of sleeping pills from Doctor Lin and mail it to him. I hadn't seen Teacher Xu in a long time. I heard that he was very active in the guerrilla zone, holding an important position. Why would he need sleeping pills? So, I made a detour to his town, paid him a visit, and delivered the pills to him directly.</p>
<p>Teacher Xu was thinner than before, but his spirit was high. When he saw me, he repeatedly clasped his hands and welcomed me into the room, where we sat down in the study. A maid brought tea, and I took out the bottle of pills, presented it to him with both hands, and asked him why he needed sleeping pills. He played with the bottle's decoration, smiled gently, and said, "I have insomnia!"</p>
<p>Outside the window was a small courtyard, with a cluster of green bamboo against the wall and a few rockeries underneath. I remembered the many years I had spent studying and asking questions in front of this window, wandering around and achieving nothing. Teacher Xu was older, and I had grown a mustache. He asked about life on the isolated island and sighed, "Shanghai is not Shouyang Mountain after all. Vetch and ferns are just money in your pocket. When the money runs out, you get pushed out."</p>
<p>I was one of those who had been pushed out. Hearing Teacher Xu's words, I felt unspeakable sorrow. Teacher Xu continued:</p>
<p>"When the front line was critical and my hometown was in danger, I made arrangements for my family affairs, wrote a will, and vowed to live and die with my country. I asked Doctor Lin to send me a bottle of sleeping pills, and I wrote eight lines myself, saying: 'A scholar cannot be humiliated, his heart cannot die. What is the purpose of reading the classics? To achieve benevolence and take righteousness, I take this medicine here. Heaven and earth, spirits, bear witness!' All my friends knew about this. I was determined to fulfill my oath. When I heard that the National Army had retreated from the city, I grabbed the bottle and poured it down. I didn't expect that I couldn't sleep at all and could only hear my wife giggling. I knew that something was wrong, and this was a very bad joke. How could I bear the accusations of deceiving the world and stealing fame? I got up and banged my head against the wall, and fainted, but I didn't die. When I woke up, everyone was around me, some trying to comfort me, some trying to persuade me. I didn't say a word, just lay there blankly. My son said something more reasonable. He said, 'The fall of the coastal cities along the Yangtze River was expected long ago and cannot be compared to the fall of the country. Loyal and upright people like Wen Tianxiang only sacrificed their lives to serve the country when there was no turning back. Now that the War of Resistance has begun, it cannot be compared to the fall of the country.' They guarded me, and there was simply no way to die. Later, my son went to the interior to participate in the War of Resistance. Before leaving, he knelt down and asked me to let his departure be exchanged for my survival. At that time, I myself didn't really want to die. I wanted to open my eyes and see the great army counterattack and drive the invaders out. I sighed, and I had to ignore those who blamed me for not dying. Ken Weng laughed at me, saying, 'It's difficult to die throughout the ages, and it's not just Lady Xi who is heartbroken, alas!'"</p>
<p>"My heart may not be dead, but I have endured humiliation. The counterattack we were waiting for never comes. This torment is truly indescribable. Neither this way nor that way, looking at the shadows of the sun, listening to the sounds, the days are like years, and I can't sit or stand still. As I waited and waited, my nerves changed. I often had insomnia, I was emaciated, and my appetite was poor. I was really afraid that I would wither and die. Fang Weng's poem, 'When the royal army has pacified the Central Plains, don't forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice,' will be written for me. My wife took out the sleeping pills, and they were very effective. It's really ridiculous that they didn't kill me when I should have died, but now they are saving me in my stolen life!"</p>
<p>"Now I have changed again. I know that no matter what you do yourself, time doesn't seem to pass slowly. But if you wait with your hands folded, then you're anxious! Instead of waiting for the counterattack, why not do it myself! I considered myself dead at the time, but now I am reborn. I've subtracted forty years from my age. I'm still young and strong, and I can contribute to the country. Brother! I'm not older than you now, maybe even younger. I've learned to shoot, and I can send and receive wireless messages. We've driven the invaders out of here, and this is now a piece of clear land. I'm very happy now. I'm much younger in spirit, but I still can't sleep at night without these pills."</p>
<p>As I listened to him, I kept raising my hand to wipe the sweat from my forehead, sitting there in silence.</p>
<p>He let me stay for two days. When I left, he personally took me to the ship dock, held my hand, and solemnly said:</p>
<p>"If you can't be Yiyi and Boqi, after you go back and see your parents, come back here, definitely, I'll wait for you!"</p>
<p>His overly excited face was so thin that I was a little worried. I secretly prayed that these pills could sustain him forever!</p>

<h3>Vow</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Imagining myself walking alone in a paradise, or traveling on the sea; settling down in a thatched hut in an unknown land, like a hermit. This reverie often made me wander in a daze for a long time.</p>
<p>But the whip of reality cruelly lashes from behind, waking me from my dreams. Looking up, I am deeply surprised. How vast is the world? What is life? Is life a dream?</p>
<p>The sharp hook at the end of the question mark grabs hold of my mind, and I carefully search for an answer. I begin to learn, to learn how to live.</p>
<p>A friend said: "I'm asking for a change, come and take my magic wand!" But, to whom can I turn? Extending a hand for help, who will lead me onto the road of life?</p>
<p>Isn't living on the pity and sympathy of others shameful? I hesitated again. Withdrawing my hand, I take a step forward. I will rely on my own strength to walk. There will never be a lack of like-minded companions on the road to truth, but we should not shrink back, extending a pale hand to others. Tired, we fall, what does it matter? We have given our last breath to pave the way. A drop of blood is a trace in history. A complete page is made up of accumulated traces.</p>
<p>Throw away the gray lenses that look backward! Don't dwell on yesterday. Why grieve and regret the past? Why linger in the old courtyard, becoming a person who clings to the past?</p>
<p>We must learn to discard the ugly legacy of the past, hold on to today, and not let every sunset pass in a sigh. Tomorrow is a new day, a day of joy, happiness, and sunshine, and that is the vow.</p>
<h3>Shameless Writing Style – Records of Beneficial Reading –</h3>
<p>— Poor Man</p>
<p>It is actually not easy to praise the merits of the aggressor, because often even you yourself will become more and more confused as you speak. However, our writers have always had a very good skill, that is, no matter whether there are flaws or whether it is right, just give him a praise, praise, praise. In fact, those words of praise are only a set, and there is really no way to take into account whether there are flaws or whether it is right. There should be a lot of historical materials to prove this "writing style", but what I have temporarily found is "Ping Song Lu".</p>
<p>"Ping Song Lu" records the process of the Yuan Dynasty's Prime Minister Bayan settling the Southern Song Dynasty, and it is a typical work of flattery. The author, Liu Minzhong, is said to be a talented writer. The four who wrote the preface, Deng Qi, Fang Hui, Du Daojian, and Zhou Ming, are probably all very good at "writing". But fortunately, I don't want to verify their lives, so I don't need to say much. But it should be especially pointed out that they are all Han Chinese. It is not wrong to regard them as writers of the "×× Newspaper" school more than 600 years ago.</p>
<p>Deng Qi said in his preface: "Our Holy Yuan Dynasty's Prime Minister Bayan, took Xianghuai as if picking up a mustard seed, and pacified Jiangnan as if turning his hand." He also said: "Our Holy Emperor uses benevolence and righteousness to command generals, and Prince of Huai'an uses benevolence and righteousness to command soldiers: a basket of food and a pot of slurry, the families helped each other."</p>
<p>Fang Hui said in his preface: "...not entering the city with a single soldier or horse, not capturing a single civilian, not plundering a single item, and this was the case wherever they went."</p>
<p>Du Daojian said in his preface: "...using troops in Jianghan, not fond of killing. On the day the city fell, the people were silent."</p>
<p>Zhou Ming said in his preface: "…leading the army again to take dozens of states in Jianghuai, heading straight to Su Xiu, the wind blowing everywhere, the soldiers not shedding blood…"</p>
<p>These all sound very nice, but after reading the book, I found many contradictory records, which really made people feel too bizarre: "On the dawn of Gui Chou, people were sent to Yangluo Fort to inform the generals and soldiers of Song, announcing the majesty and virtue of the dynasty. The Song generals did not surrender. Xia Huai and others lined up thousands of warships under the great river, cutting across the river, with a majestic momentum, as if they could not be approached. On Jia Yin, the father sent someone to explain the good and bad to the Song generals, and the Song generals replied: 'We have received great favors from the Great Song for many years, and we should do our best and die to repay the favor. This is the time. How can there be a reason to betray and surrender? Prepare our armor and weapons to decide: today's world of my Song, gambling on an isolated bet, winning or losing is in this one throw.'" The Prime Minister then directed the generals to advance and attack Yangluo Fort, but did not succeed all day…"</p>
<p>"The Song soldiers were defeated in the river, and the hearts of the people in Yangluo Fort disintegrated. Hundreds of thousands of Song soldiers were killed and injured, and the corpses floated down the river…"</p>
<p>"On Ding Si, the Prime Minister led his troops to Dingjia Zhou…On Ji Wei, the Prime Minister directed the generals, taught them strategies, and used cannons, bows, and crossbows and other equipment on the river bank to attack together…chasing and killing for dozens of miles, corpses floating on the river, the water turning red…"</p>
<p>"On Ren Wu, to Zhang Zhou. The advancing soldiers were deadlocked. …The Prime Minister summoned the generals and pointed out strategies, ordering each to prepare siege equipment, and agreeing to attack in separate ways the next day. First sending someone to shout under the city, but the people in the city did not listen. On Gui Wei, ordering the officials to write and shoot letters into the city, but they still did not listen. The Prime Minister personally supervised thousands of troops in front of the tent to the south of the city, and built many fire cannons and bows and crossbows and other equipment, attacking day and night without stopping. To Jia Shen at Si hour…it was captured, and the city was slaughtered. It turns out that 'as if picking up a mustard seed' and 'as if turning his hand' are just this here 'not surrendering' and there 'not listening' and here 'not succeeding all day' and there 'attacking day and night without stopping'. And the so-called 'not fond of killing' and 'soldiers not shedding blood' are just here 'corpses floating down the river' and there 'the water turning red'. And 'on the day the city fell, the people were silent' is just 'slaughtering the city'. In this situation, how can the army be so civilized that not even a uniformed 'rough man' and a horse ran into the city, without capturing a single civilian or robbing a single item, and the people are so lively that they prepare tea and food, with each family congratulating each other? It is really strange to the extreme.</p>
<p>So, did the people who wrote the preface simply not read the book carefully? That's not the case. Even if they read it carefully, they still have to write it this way. The reason is, as mentioned above, that the words of praise are just this one set. At this time, the writer is actually very pitiful, and it is considered that he has nailed himself to death with nails.</p>
<p>But there is still one question: Since the main purpose of this book is to flatter, why didn't the author Liu Minzhong just write that the Grand Chancellor settled the Southern Song Dynasty without moving a soldier or fighting a battle? Wouldn't that be more straightforward? But that wouldn't work either. Because in that case, not only would the historical facts be completely changed, and people wouldn't believe your account at all, but it would also deprive the protagonist of the book of his "achievements" and "might". So the writer is also very pitiful at this time, and he has also nailed himself to death with nails.</p>
<p>However, this is the reason for the shameless writing style!</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Miserable Life of Coolies</h3>
<p>(Seen in the May issue of this newspaper from the Xuantong eleventh year of Qing)</p>
<p>The coolies kidnapped from Macau and led back to Shanghai by Director Chen from the East Ocean arrived at the port at Shenshi on the 21st, totaling 227 people. The Niu Ye Ke steamer was moored at the Wan Chang Wharf in Hongkou. During the disembarkation, all the Min and Guangdong merchants competed to watch, and there was hardly any room to stand in the crowds along the several miles from Hongkou to the Big Bridge. The magistrate and various committee members all personally visited the shore to inspect and suppress, and to check the name registration book. The so-called coolies climbed ashore one after another, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, covered in sores and emaciated bodies, pus scabs and sweat, almost unbearable to approach. Moreover, each person was wearing a purple floral cloth coat, covered in dirt and mess, no different from beggars. Yesterday, they were transported by barge to the porridge factory in the South Gate to be settled properly. Today, various committee members gathered to interrogate several people individually. They each recounted their kidnapping and various forms of persecution and abuse after boarding the ship, some crying with tears streaming down their faces, and some sobbing and unable to recognize others. According to them: "On the way from Macau to the East Ocean, four people died of illness, three jumped into the water to commit suicide, and thirty or forty people were sick but not dead. Eleven people were beaten, one of whom was already suffering from a minor illness before the beating. The doctor told the captain that this person was sick and should not be beaten, but the captain did not listen and beat him severely, causing the person to recover only after more than ten days. No attempt was made to save those who jumped into the water, and the ship continued to sail. When the sun was scorching hot, they were suffocated in the cabin and not allowed to go out, and so on."</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Using Trademarks Inside Shoes</h3>
<p>Lu Xiangxiong and Sun Juxing, etc., of the shoe industry, due to the use of trademark characters printed inside the shoes, which had been used for a long time to counterfeit other brands, and because boots and shoes are discarded after being worn out, and printing characters inside would inevitably be discarded as well, which is extremely disrespectful! In the future, patterns should be used as markers instead of characters, and all members of the industry are invited to follow suit to show respect and cherishment. Magistrate Ye has already issued a public notice prohibiting it.</p>

<h3>Is This the Time to Only Seek Profit?</h3>
<p>— Li Ke</p>
<p>These past few days, when our fellow compatriots of the middle and lower classes in Shanghai pick up their rice bowls to eat, they can't help but sigh and say, "Eating is difficult!"</p>
<p>Living in Shanghai was already not easy, and now, "eating in Shanghai" is also tormenting our fellow compatriots of the middle and lower classes in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Logically, China's resistance against Japan is for the sake of national independence and survival. At the same time, isn't it also to improve the people's lives? The war of resistance is by no means for a select few, but for the vital interests of every person in China. Therefore, during this war of resistance, every truly patriotic compatriot should fully display the great "compatriotic love" and should not have even a trace of "profit-seeking" mentality.</p>
<p>If an example or metaphor is needed, then the best example and the best metaphor here would be a lonely boat on stormy seas. May I ask: Can each passenger in a lonely boat on stormy seas not help and care for each other, and instead refrain from working together to save the boat from the dangers of the storm? If, at this critical moment of life and death, someone is still so heartless as to focus solely on profiting from others, it is tantamount to killing others and killing oneself at the same time.</p>
<p>According to recent newspaper reports about the chaos in the rice market, it is due to deliberate manipulation by hoarders, coupled with large-scale purchases by large households, which has plunged our fellow compatriots of the middle and lower classes in Shanghai into panic. Although the Market Management Committee and the Price Evaluation Committee have secretly investigated the owners of the stored rice and reported them to the authorities for investigation and prosecution of speculation and manipulation, this "shameful event" displayed during this war of resistance is truly humiliating.</p>
<p>Today, as Shanghai's environment is deteriorating daily and various evil forces are watching from all sides, seeking an opportunity to launch a malicious attack on the spirit of the people of Shanghai, all our compatriots in Shanghai, regardless of class, should work together in harmony, holding hands without revealing any gaps, lest we give villains the convenience to attack.</p>
<p>Now, to focus on profiting from one's own compatriots is tantamount to being disloyal to the country, undermining the war of resistance, and sucking the blood of one's own compatriots! Here, I not only hope that the hoarders will have a change of heart and refrain from speculation and manipulation, but also sincerely advise all those who want to "get rich" by taking advantage of the war of resistance: Now is not the time to "only seek profit"!</p>
<h3>The Demolition Wave in Qingyu Lane</h3>
<p>— Fei Yun</p>
<p>Landlord Sets 15th as Deadline to Move Out; Tenants Request Mediation from All Parties</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," the concessions have practically turned into a "pleasure haven," where people eat, drink, and make merry, leaving the war far behind. Despite the rising cost of living and landlords taking advantage of the situation, Shanghainese still strut around dance halls, movie theaters, and brightly lit gambling dens.</p>
<p>But behind this decadent lifestyle, we can still see many heroic struggles. Seeing these facts, we can't help but feel that human nature is often two-sided, one side being supremely noble and the other being bottomlessly depraved!</p>
<p>For example, these past two days, due to the issue of demolition and reconstruction, more than three thousand tenants are engaged in a struggle representing Shanghai tenants against landlords. This struggle seems to be expanding day by day, and up to now, the problem has only become more serious and more acute.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I made a special visit to the scene of the incident, which is the well-known Qingyu Lane on New Chongqing Road. There are a total of six alleys there, with houses of one-story, two-story, and three-story buildings. Because they are old houses, the rent is of course much cheaper than the current rent. Precisely because it is too cheap, the landlord, Shanghai Women's Bank, is pressuring the tenants of Qingyu Lane to move out. Although the tenants had sued the Women's Bank, the tenants lost the case.</p>
<p>As soon as you approach the intersection of New Chongqing Road and Mendeland Road, you can see the bamboo fences at the entrance of Qingyu Lane. What a shocking sight! Before houses are demolished in Shanghai, fences must be erected. Therefore, the fence is like an elegy of aesthetic education. I patrolled back and forth on New Chongqing Road and saw that several shops along the road were still calmly continuing their business. On the surface, it didn't seem like a tragedy of three thousand people being displaced was about to happen here.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I went inside and talked to a friend, I realized that the anxious emotions of all the tenants were increasing day by day. The Women's Bank's final order to forcibly demolish the houses, cut the lines, and cut off the water could be issued at any moment. This is such a big threat to the more than three thousand tenants living in Qingyu Lane!</p>
<p>I asked my friend, "How is the mediation going outside?"</p>
<p>That friend said angrily:</p>
<p>"They said they would give a reply on the 15th. If it succeeds, it will be on the 15th. If it doesn't, I'm afraid they will tear off the roofs, cut off the water, and cut off the electric wires!"</p>
<p>"Isn't the landlord willing to compromise at all?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Of course not! We first said we would wait until the war was over, but they refused. Then we said we would wait a year, half a year, and finally even said we would wait three more months, but they wouldn't even wait half a day! If there were no war, we might be able to find another way. But now in Shanghai, where do you think more than three thousand tenants can move to?"</p>
<p>This struggle is still ongoing. We hope that the concession authorities and the mediators can give them some help.</p>
<p>It is said that after the houses in Qingyu Lane are rebuilt, they are planned to be renamed "Shuntian Village," with sanitary facilities. Each house will cost from 5,000 to 8,500 yuan, with ten years of rent, payable in installments. According to this calculation, the landlord will immediately earn hundreds of thousands of yuan. It seems to be just a matter of lifting a hand.</p>
<p>However, we believe that during the national war of resistance, the landlord should also put themselves in the shoes of the three thousand tenants. If you lived in Qingyu Lane, what would you do?</p>
<p>In yesterday's article "Refugee Products Exhibition," Zhang Xiaoshi's painting exhibition was mistakenly written as "Wu" Xiaoshi. This is hereby corrected. — Fei Yun</p>
<h3>Dark Market Prices Soar (Benefit Sale for Donations)</h3>
<p>— Ma Ge</p>
<h3>Be Careful of Protection Money</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Zang Huanchun. The original text was too long, so I have excerpted it as follows: "Last night (the 5th) at 9:30 PM, I was traveling east on Singapore Road in a rickshaw because of business. Near Jiaozhou Road, the streetlights were damaged, and it was very dark nearby. As I approached a teahouse, suddenly more than ten people stood in the middle of the road, blocking the way. Several others crashed into the rickshaw. At that time, one person rolled up his trouser leg and claimed that his pants had been torn by the rickshaw. The others also blocked the rickshaw and insisted on compensation. I had no way to escape, and there was no police post in the area, so I had to pay the full amount. I am now requesting that your newspaper publish this incident to warn pedestrians."</p>
<h3>Suzhou People Braid Their Hair</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Suzhou people are known for their gentleness. They are good at eloquence but not good at fighting. Therefore, there is a saying, "Better to argue with a Suzhou person than to chat with a Ningbo person," because Ningbo people speak very bluntly.</p>
<p>But Suzhou people sometimes have to fight. Their art of fighting is to first braid their hair, to make a show of force to subdue the opponent. If the opponent is determined not to yield, the result may become real.</p>
<p>But Suzhou people are still Suzhou people. They only braid their hair and are unwilling to fight. Ningbo people are really tough guys. After three "damn you"s, they will draw out their fists to fight.</p>
<p>But are there not many Suzhou people in the international arena?</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Bearing Grief and Suffering, Tears Sprinkle in All Directions; Practicing Frugality and Diligence, Ten Acres of Land</p>
<p>There was a matter where Mrs. Sulia rewarded Jin Danyun with 5,000 U.S. dollars, but Jin Danyun was unwilling to accept it. But this reward was public, and Mrs. Sulia insisted on giving it to her. Jin Danyun then sought instructions from the Foreign Affairs Committee, which ordered that Jin Danyun could receive it. After Danyun received it, she donated the money in her father's name to a scholarship fund to help the children of veterans who were unable to attend school. Therefore, everyone praised Jin Danyun endlessly, and even Mrs. Sulia respected her even more. This time, when Jin Danyun and Lin Jiancheng got married, Mrs. Sulia wanted to give her a big gift. But if she gave her money, she would never accept it, and giving her money would also seem disrespectful. Therefore, Mrs. Sulia knew that they were going on a honeymoon trip after their wedding, so she wanted to give them a family travel car, the so-called mobile home. Although this family rental company had not yet opened, many car models had already been sent. Mrs. Sulia wanted to choose the most suitable, best-equipped, and most suitable car for a honeymoon trip to give to Jin Danyun as a dowry. But Chu Jin Danyun still refused to accept it. She said, "We really don't need this kind of car, because both Lin Jiancheng and I have jobs and can't always go out to travel. Even if we occasionally go out, our travels are job-related and don't allow us to go out and play freely. After we get married, we both have a vacation. We originally wanted to go out to travel and play. We can also try the convenience of this family travel car. But it's only for a month. We still want to form a fixed small family after that. Now, for that kind of car, as a rental or for testing purposes, we will use it for a month, but we would never dare to accept it as a gift." Mrs. Sulia had to give up when she saw that she would not accept it. At this moment, Jin Danyun could not delay any longer and hurried back to Shanghai. Let's talk about Zhu Airen accompanying the He sisters to Freedom Village. Zhu Laoyuan, the village chief of Zhu, had already known in advance that his granddaughter Airen would bring her two classmates to this place today, so he was waiting at home. In addition, there was Zhu Airen's mother, Mrs. Zhu, and Zhu Airen's elder sister, Zhu Aiqun, who were also at home. This Freedom Village is a new village, which is somewhat different from Anle Town. Because although Anle Town has gradually improved in recent years, many places have lost their original appearance. Unlike Freedom Village, which is completely newly formed, it has a new atmosphere.

<h3>"China Electric" War of Resistance Film "Bloodshed in an Isolated City" Completely Filmed</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>Premiering in Chongqing from May 5th</p>
<p>Prelude to Victory</p>
<p>Since the Central Film Studio moved to Chongqing, the limitations of material conditions have made it impossible to start filming several planned films. However, in terms of newsreels, "The Shanghai Front," "The Eastern Battlefield," "The Active Western Front," and "The Ninth Month of the War of Resistance" have been completed one after another. Problems such as electrical sets and indoor locations, which were previously considered difficult, were not solved until last summer, and formal filming work began at that time.</p>
<p>The first production planned by China Electric is the war of resistance newsreel "Bloodshed in an Isolated City." Since the film began production last year, it was suspended due to material problems. It was not until recently that the entire film was completed. The film tells the heroic story of General Yao Ziqing's defense of Baoshan City. The actors, such as Bo Sen, Bai Yun, and Bao Shi, have all received university education. Although they are not veteran superstars and may not be very skilled in performing on the screen, their enthusiasm and efforts have made the film exceptionally colorful.</p>
<p>Also completed at the same time as "Bloodshed in an Isolated City" is "Prelude to Victory." This film is a war of resistance newsreel, so it is classified as Volume 5 of the "Documentary of the War of Resistance Against Japan." In this film, there are real scenes of the "Fifth Anniversary of the New Life Movement," Chairman Chiang's instructions to women compatriots, Ms. Soong Mei-ling's opinions on women's donations, and the heroic posture of our Northwest cavalry attacking and the scenes of the Japanese fleeing in embarrassment. The entire film is full of scenes that make people feel extremely excited.</p>
<p>Now, these two completed war of resistance films have begun premiering simultaneously at the "Xinchuan," "Guotai," and "Wei Yi" theaters in Chongqing from May 5th.</p>
<h3>Movie Theaters Sprout Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain</h3>
<p>— (Le Tian)</p>
<p>Five Are Under Construction; Four Are in Negotiations</p>
<p>Shanghai can be considered a paradise and a hell, with extreme disparity between happiness and suffering. It is truly unbelievable. Nearly five million residents have crowded the isolated island to the brim. All kinds of businesses are three times more profitable. Entertainment venues are full day and night. Many entertainment merchants are happy to be making money. It is said that there are five more movie theaters that are being actively built and will open one after another in the fall. The locations of these five are: (1) at the intersection of Maite Hesi Tuo Road and Aiwenni Road; (2) near Jing'an Temple on Maite Hesi Tuo Road; (3) Jing'an Temple; (4) near Jinmen Grand Theater on Fuxu Road; (5) Beidang Road near Xujiahui. The names of those few have not yet been decided. There are also four others who are difficult to realize because there is no suitable location at the moment.</p>
<h3>Ji Gaosheng Lin and Gao Shishou</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Since Yang Xiaolou's death, everyone in the opera world has said that there is no martial arts opera to watch. This seems reasonable, but if no one encourages the younger generation, then it is also something that should not be done. Therefore, if we discover outstanding talents, we should promote them. It seems more meaningful than those who are simply there to cheer them on.</p>
<p>I am now introducing to you Gao Shenglin from the fourth class of Fu Liancheng. He is the son of the famous actor Gao Qingkui. It goes without saying that he has been practicing since he was a child. After graduating from Fu Liancheng, he also studied with Yang Xiaolou. Xiaolou's niece is married to Shenglin. (Xiaolou's son-in-law is Liu Yanfang, and Yanfang is Shenglin's father-in-law). Because of the family relationship and Shenglin's eagerness to learn, Xiaolou looked at Shenglin with different eyes. Although it was not for a few years, he actually learned a lot of real skills. In the last few days of Xiaolou's life, Shenglin never left the Yang family, and their relationship was very close. Speaking of Shenglin returning to Shanghai, we also have to look at him with a new perspective. I will first report the repertoire for the first five days. The first day is "Changban Slope," the second day is "Picking the Huaishai," the third day is "Jizhou City," the fourth day is "Evil Tiger Village," and the fifth day is "Heroic Righteousness." After reading this, the readers may believe that I am not bragging but telling the truth.</p>
<p>There is also his younger brother, who is only twenty-one years old, four years younger than his older brother. He is called Gao Shishou. Just by looking at the name, you know that he is from the fifth class of Fu Liancheng. His skills are also amazing. "Flower Butterfly," "Four Heroes Village," "Jiepai Pass," etc. are all his masterpieces. The two of them are almost always in the same play this time, although Zhang Lianting is brought along (i.e., following Shenglin to Shanghai). Although Shishou has just passed his coming-of-age ceremony, he is already good at socializing and speaks very pleasantly. He looks very dignified. If you didn't say it was Gao Shishou, who would know that he has so many good skills? (Benefit Sale for Donations)</p>

<h3>Prelude to "Demon of Desire"</h3>
<p>— Yin Qiu</p>
<p>"Demon of Desire," written by the world-renowned Russian writer Tolstoy, originally named "The Power of Darkness," has been performed in Shanghai by various theater groups such as Zhonglv, Amateur, and Zhongfa. Because of its tight plot and its pinpricking of the dark side of Chinese society, it has been warmly welcomed by audiences everywhere.</p>
<p>Because it is an immortal masterpiece containing a realistic story that satirizes the current social order and rectifies morality, Mr. Yue Feng, the famous director of Xinhua Company, decided to adapt the play again and bring it to the screen.</p>
<p>On the screen, "Demon of Desire" is of course more realistic and tense than the stage play. At the same time, for the audience who have seen the "Demon of Desire" drama, they are eager to know what happened after Li Qi suffered from the pain and accusations of conscience after repenting after the play was unable to continue being performed on stage. Director Yue also gives each audience a very satisfactory answer here.</p>
<p>In the "Demon of Desire" on the screen, the distribution of actors is suitable for each person's character. This is a decision that Yue Feng made after several days and nights of research.</p>
<p>Shan Meixi plays the heartless, cowardly, and contradictory farmhand Li Qi. This is the most difficult role to play, but Meixi plays it appropriately, which is commendable. The romantic, vicious, murderous, and infanticidal young woman Hua Yueying is played by Lu Luming. Tan Ying plays Zhang Xiaojin in this play. Her role is the most suitable. A vivid Xiaojin seems to be exposed in front of our eyes. The newcomer Li plays the little girl Wang who was given birth by Li Qi and was abandoned. When she was born by Li Qi, her pitiful expression caused the audience to shed tears of sympathy. Others include He Jianfei as the eccentric Zhang Yubian, Yan Fei as the realistic and cunning Li Hongshi, Wang Guilin as the loyal and honest Li Dashun, Tang Jie as Hu Dayu, Wang Lingling as Zhang Xiaoyin, Tian Taixuan as Wang's mother, Liu Jiqun as Chen Laoer, and You Guangzhao as Chen's nephew, who all fit their identities.</p>
<p>"Demon of Desire," "Demon of Desire" on the screen, can be said to be a success in all aspects. It will be released in the Jincheng Grand Theater soon.</p>
<h3>Xu Yunhui's Snow in June</h3>
<p>— Xi Tong</p>
<p>What I admire most is the beginning of the Execution of E'e scene when I watched the Huxhe Amateur Opera Troupe perform "Snow in June" a few times ago.</p>
<p>Xu, a amateur operatic performer, played Dou E. In the "Visiting Prison" scene, Dou E had an ordinary face and ordinary clothes, just like the blue-clothed dress of an ordinary poor woman. However, at the beginning of the "Execution of E'e" scene, it was completely different. At the beginning, the gongs and drums were beating tightly, although it was said that Dou E had the opportunity to change clothes, the atmosphere was particularly tense. When the curtain was lifted, two executioners suddenly grabbed Dou E on stage. One of the executioners on the right was very wonderful, with fierce eyebrows, a murderous face, and a pheasant feather inserted in his helmet, revealing his fleshy and fat chest, and showing off his prestige with his knife, helping to create a lot of realistic atmosphere. I was very surprised by the success of this fat executioner. When I inquired, I learned that he was the cross-dressing of Mr. Li Qin Xian. No wonder he played so well!</p>
<p>Bao E wore red clothes, her hands were tied behind her back, and a white flag was inserted behind her. Bao E's face was painted with greasepaint and black ink strips, with her eyes closed and her head lowered. She took a few steps, and after a while, she opened her eyes again. At this time, everyone in the audience held their breath and did not make a sound, giving her endless sympathy. The people under the stage and the people on the stage became one, and Bao E's pain was the pain of the crowd. We really think about E'e. She was probably already stunned at this time. Look, she couldn't even say the words completely! She weakly raised her head slightly and said the word "up," then said the word "sky," and then squeezed out the word "no way" from her seams. In this way, the sadness and joy increased! These four words are enough, and the following "Entering the Door to the Earth" and other singing sentences are not necessary! These four words are worth a large section of singing sentences and have a touch of blood. In this situation, these four words have the power of a thousand pounds. Otherwise, how could they win the applause of the whole audience!</p>
<p>This is a realm that is not easy to obtain, where the audience and the performer become one and blend together seamlessly. If it weren't for Ms. Xu's usual efforts, how could she have achieved such an achievement!</p>
<p>So I said that when I watched "Snow in June," what I admired most was the beginning of the Execution of E'e scene.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Brutal Behavior of Warlords Massacring Actors</p>
<p>Chu Yupu was originally from Jining, Shandong. His family was poor. His older brother, named Yu Feng, was ten years older than him. Yupu did not have good habits since he was a child. When he was ten years old, he followed some bandits and blindly caused murder cases in Shandong Province. He could not gain a foothold, so he fled to Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province. Later, his reputation became greater and greater, and the government arrested him very tightly. He had no choice but to disband his gang and hide alone in the Qujia Weizi in the north of the city. A member of the Zhao clan, named Zhao Yaoyun, kept him at home and treated him very kindly. In the second year of the Republic of China, Leng Yu served as the commander of the Third Division and was stationed in Xuzhou. His method of suppressing bandits was to use both kindness and power. Anyone who could repent and rehabilitate could be recruited. Chu Yupu was also a well-known bandit leader at the time, so he and Chao Pan, a monk (also a giant bandit), both turned over a new leaf that year and were appointed as battalion commanders by Leng. At that time, Zhang Zongchang served as a regimental commander, and Fang Zhenwu served as a battalion commander of the supply and transportation battalion. Later, Zhang, Chu, and Fang developed a close relationship, which started from that time. At this time, Chu suddenly met a prostitute named Wang Xiangting, and the two became very close. Unexpectedly, in the second revolution, Leng's army was defeated by Feng Guozhang and retreated to Jiangning, where it had already collapsed. At this time, Chu Yupufu was incorporated by Feng Du, and the General with Long Legs was also appointed as the regimental commander of the General School Regiment. Both of them often lived in Yuling. However, they were not from the military and were often discriminated against. In addition, they spent money excessively and made losses, so they both left Nanjing and went to Zhang Zuolin outside the Guan. Chu thought that Xuzhou was his second hometown. One was to visit Zhao Yaoyun, the benefactor who had saved his life (actually, he was harboring him), and the other was to visit his old lover Wang Xiangting. Who knew that Ms. Wang, although a prostitute, was extremely generous. As soon as she heard that Chu was going to the Guan to seek development, she immediately exchanged all her jewelry for five or six hundred yuan and presented it to Lao Chu with both hands as travel expenses. The remaining money could be used for social expenses. Therefore, later, as soon as Zhang Zuolin entered the Guan, Lao Chu became a brigade commander under Zhang Zongchang. When the General with Long Legs was stationed in Xuzhou in the name of the commander of the bandit suppression in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, the gratitude and intimacy between Chu and Wang Xiangting reached their peak. In less than two years, Zhang and Chu both became strange officials. These rough people also knew how to repay kindness, so they first invited a Zhao village leader (Yaoyun) who knew nothing about literature to the Tianjin Governor's Office to serve as the chief counselor. The Zhao family originally had a large population. When they all went to Tianjin together, all the big and small ones were given official positions. At that time, the eight departments of the Governor's Office and the troops led by Lao Chu all had members of the Zhao clan stationed among them. For a time, there was a popular saying of Zhao Banlv. From this, it can be seen that Chu treated the Zhao clan well. — (7) —</p>
