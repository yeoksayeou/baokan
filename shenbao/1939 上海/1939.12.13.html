<p>社評</p>
<h3>粵桂戰事烏瞰</h3>
<p>日軍攻下了南髯，分兩路北犯，一路沿邕賓公路而犯賓陽，一路沿邕武公路而犯武鳴；邕賓一綫，華軍與日軍相持於七塘之間；邕武一綫，相持於高峯坳之間。大戰的開展，雖尙有待，但觀察家預測，在廣西羣山中，將有一决最激烈的戰爭。中日雙方都已派遣援軍遄赴前綫，都已佈置陣綫，作進攻準備，所以日軍的進佔南甯，乃桂南戰爭的開始，而不是戰爭目標的完成。自北海從日軍登陸的欽州灣到南甯，不足一百英里；他竭陸海空三軍的力量，不難進展，但南甯以上，勢難深人。軍事的重心在南甯近郊，但雙方軍事盤旋，互相牽制，其波動幾遍粵桂兩省。在粵漢路一綫，日軍遙與粵南呼應，企圖自蘆苞花縣進犯銀盞坳，打通粵漢路而北趨湘，西趨桂；這一策略，已被華軍一一粉碎。在西江方面，日軍想從三水，穿過肇慶峽而北趨蒼梧，以爲南甯聲援，但日軍的兵力，始終沒有越過三水一綫。至粵東方面，日軍利用僞軍，由澄海趨饒平屬的黃岡，越分水關而進攻閩南的詔安；詔安一度被日僞佔領，後經華軍的努力反攻，沿途截擊，日僞軍死傷奇重，仍退回了澄海。目前粵閩兩方華軍，已取得聯絡；分水關粵閩邊界一帶，已無日軍蹤跡。日軍的利用匪僞，進擾閩省，設其沿公路而進佔閩雨重鎭漳州一帶，由其在閩北一帶無海軍活動觀之，似尚有待；然則日軍的實際目的，想來也無非策應桂南戰事分散華軍的注意力，而主要的目的，並不在閩南。</p>
<p>以上是就日軍的行動講。至於華軍，亦復針鋒相對，旗鼓相當。華軍主要的戰略，是在把日軍的後方，化爲前方，日軍由欽州灣至南甯，其所佔領的區域，爲一狹長的甬道；欽防雖陷日軍手中，而在雷州半島及靈山縣，華方尙駐有重軍；這些軍隊，如果開往日軍後方，必有切斷日軍甬道的一日。現在粵西靈山的華軍勁旅一枝，向東移動，以冀截斷公路，克復欽縣，現在已將粵桂邊境的小董克復。另有華軍勁旅一枝，則由合浦出發，向欽縣推進。兩枝軍隊，合力夾攻，現已進迫欽縣城郊。無論這項兵力，能吾一舉而攻克欽防，斷絕日軍後路，可是這些部隊，往來日軍後方，破壞交通路綫，必將使日軍疲於奔命。一城一地的得失，不足定全局。南甯之失，僅爲一空城，人力物資，一無所存。日軍自入南甯，前有反攻之重軍，後有夾擊的部隊，非但日軍切斷桂越交通的目的不能達，恐保持其前後方的交通，亦復不可能。所以日軍要深入廣西，向北突破邕賓一綫，下柳州而窺桂林；向南沿公路而下龍州，切斷桂越綫；向西沿百色而侵入雲南，斷滇越鐵路，這無異是緣木求魚。日本首相阿部最近在大坂宴席上演說，蔣委員長指揮下至少尚有二百四十師，在這以外，還有一百萬的游擊隊橫行各地。他於是促全國準備五年至十年的戰爭。這就是講日本雖得到南甯，在戰略上絲毫沒有得到決定的意義，反而因此冒險，把戰綫更拉長了，而使其兵力分配上，軍需的接濟上，加多一重困難。中國如果在桂南戰役上，用雄厚的兵力，守住邕賓路上崑崙關的險要地帶，再從粵南各地派遣軍隊赴日軍的後方，那末冒險深入的日軍，必遭失敗的命述。白崇禧將軍昨天的談話，謂隨時可以收復南甯，殲滅日軍，確有其可能，決不是一句豪語！</p>

<h3>各堆棧囤積米糧　當局已着手澈查　捕房特別科已行使職務　平糶洋米勢將提早進行　日方聲稱與兩租界合作控制米價</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局暨法租界公董局、於十日頒怖文吿、取締界內囤坦克米糧、抬高市價、如仍有違犯前項行為者、則局方均將不予保護、或並驅逐出境、而將其存貨充公、昨據探悉、公共租界捕心、茲已將關於此事之偵查及執行職務、交特別科進行辦理、惟决定避免一切表面宣傳、記者昨謁捕房某高級官員、據表示稱、捕房方面决嚴密鎭定執行此項新職務、以解除界內中國人民食糧之困厄、不作宣傳、决非鬆懈職務之謂、至外間揣測、以為后捕房調查員與米商之間、今後將趨多事、此為對無根之言、蓋文吿中所指摘者、僅為囤積之奸商、與正當米商、固無涉也、囤戶未必全係米商、此間固有操縱之人、非特向來不是米商、抑且並非商人、居然囤米圖利、使米價漫天高漲、凡此之屬、均在捕房調查員踪跡之列、至捕房此次之行動、决非採取高壓手腕、必俟彼頑强之徒、一意孤行、堅不遵聽兩租界當道之警吿者、始在被微戒之列、職是之故、捕房當局、決定不多作宣傳、以免徒增意外之困難、惟實事求是、以達抑平米價之目的、各界人士、爲公衆利益起見、如知悉有將米糧囤積投機壟斷情事者、即行報吿法租界及公共租界之警務當局、俾便據以控究、協叻進行、則所切盼也、</p>
<p>日方聲稱　協助當局</p>
<p>字林報云、工部局某員、昨（十一日）吿記者稱、警吿米糧投機者與囤積者之布吿公佈後、並無發展、尙未有人按照布吿之規定、而向工部局吿發非法貿利者、故局方未曾對米商採取驅逐出兩租界或沒收存米等行動、米糧運入本市固有若干阻碍、但今仍有米糧目被佔區與西貢運來、今預料日後將發生何事、猶嫌過早、祇能靜待而注視發展云、據日陸軍發言人昨日聲稱、日軍當局對於公共租界與法租界當局控制米價之努力、當予以完全合作、日陸軍當局將採取行動、增加運入滬市之米糧、而助使局勢得吿解決云、</p>
<p>秘密監視界內堆棧</p>
<p>租界當局因米價高張、與本市治安大有影響、故除由兩租界會銜布吿制止、將米糧囤積投機壟斷外、工部局食物燃料供應委員會、連日會商後、已有甚大之發展、對操縱糧食牟利之徒、採取斷然之處置、聞現已着手偵查各堆棧囤積之米糧·麵粉·豆油·等物、並派警秘密監視具有操縱米糧抬價牟利之數家堆棧、一俟査得證據確實後、將予以處罰、聞連日市民向當局吿發奸商者、爲數甚衆、此舉對當局之制裁奸商、甚有帮助云、</p>
<p>大戶拋售市塲趨穩</p>
<p>大中社記者昨日曾以兩租界會銜佈吿制裁米價辦法、對一般囤積操縱之徒之影響、叩詢於某米業領袖、據談、兩租界會銜之佈吿、最有成效者、可使一般大戶紛紛拋售、按滬米價之所以形成空前飛漲之局面者、全係大戶將運滬米糧吸進後、儲存於堆棧內、待善價而沽、致造成米價之在漲、自兩租界佈吿後、一般囤米大戶、在衆目睽視之下、深恐遭受嚴厲處罰、勢不得不儘速拋售、至是使運滬之米糧、方得掃數供給市塲、公開賣買、不爲牟利者所操縱、而居奇抬價云、</p>
<p>辦理平糶提早會商申請合法外匯、訂購洋米辦理平糶，爲抑平米價最能奏效之良法、昨日下午、虞洽卿氏稱、現擬提早於二三日內與金融界籌商、積極進行此事、又據米號公會主席張念萱之意見、此次辦理平糶、米之質量、當較上次爲遜、因質量甚佳之米、價格較高、有違救濟平民之宗旨、其出售平糶之辦法、當改由各米號家分售之、旣可使平民就地購買、復可免除擁擠、</p>
<p>米糧不能運滬成因</p>
<p>據外人方面消息、江蘇區之蘇常一帶產米區、所以不能運滬原因、的有下列數點、（一）大批日軍之在淪陷區者、約有一百萬名以上、每月所需之米糧、其數殊屬可驚、非大量之供給不可、（二）本年米穀、絡續由華中運往日本、致來源受此影響、不克大量運抵、本月一日續有輪載米穀四十萬包運往日本之大阪、該項米穀、聞由日軍主持採往、以上兩點、均係米糧來源不增之癥結、</p>
<p>廉恥運動發忠吿書</p>
<p>本市各界所發起之廉恥運動、今爲第二日、除向各學校各團體各商店各工廠各里衖住戶分發宣言、繼續闡錫廉恥運動意義、推行各項糾正工作外、並以本市奸商囤米、致米價騰貴、影響民食及社會治安甚鉅、特忠吿囤戶及米商、抑低米價、以維民食、</p>
<h3>新聞河鐵門開放第二日　進出者殊擁擠　探視園趨之若鶩　分道進出秩序良好</h3>
<p>新開河鐵門開放後、昨日爲第二日、進出於南市居民、以戰後二年、不無背鄕離井者、若干居民、因事前限於派司、無法入內、今法租界當局一旦開放、均趨之若鶩、故前昨兩日進出於南市者、人數殊見擁擠、法租界電車乘客、赴十六鋪者、驟增數倍、聞開放結果、秩序尙稱良好、</p>
<p>分道進出</p>
<p>據大通社記者昨晨赴新開河鐵門旁視察、自租界進入南市、或自南市進入租界居民、絡繹不絕、法捕房方面、昨晨爲疏洩進出之擁擠情形起見、除正中鐵門關閉外、將鐵門左右兩旁之小門同時開放、自南市進入租界者、須從北首小門進入、自租界入南市者、則從靠南首小門而出、</p>
<p>檢查甚嚴</p>
<p>進出鐵門居民、雖法租界並不需通行證、惟站立於民國路鐵門外之日兵及「大道警察、」則須憑南市居民證、」始許通過、且檢視甚嚴、上項通行證印有上海特務機關南班、及偽「上海市府南市區公署」等字樣、同時居民若持有浦東「居民證」者、亦得進出、惟持有虹口「居民證」者、則緊立於鐵門旁者頗多、察若輩意向、係在疑懼虹口「通行證」是否亦通用於是處、故不敢輕於嘗試、一人其內、俱將無法回返租界也、</p>
<p>秩序良好</p>
<p>關於軍輛之通行情形、就大通社記者靜觀的歷一小時之時間中、並無所見、因其中間鐵門之關閉、如僅藉兩側小門、則車輛似難通過、臨時殆將開啟中間鐵門矣、北側小門進口處、法捕房派有探捕多名騐守、故秩序甚佳、大通社記者嗣赴老北門·南陽橋·各鐵門視察、均仍繼續封閉中、有謂南陽橋鐵門有於昨日開啟之說、證明並非事實、據新聲社記者所得可恃消息、以開放先後論、當以新北門鐵門爲先、當局且規定新開河鐵門爲出口處、新北門鐵門則將改爲入口、以免影響秩序、至於浦江賣渡之舢舨、竟無人顧問、</p>
<p>車輛派司</p>
<p>十一日　文十海日報載　按在以前、凡由南市取道新開河鐵門、以入法租界、例須有法租界者之通行證、方可入內、現聞此項通行證、巳自十二月十一日起、暫時取銷矣、惟聞關於卡車之進出新開河鐵門者、則仍依向例辦理、</p>

<h3>偽稅局推行「印花」外商堅決反對　設「駐關監查處」查騐化品　强迫貨物納稅證貼用偽花　進出口行一致絕</h3>
<p>上海自淪陷之後、江海關被迫易幟、稅收改用「華興券」、中央銀行收稅人員被迫撤退、關稅收入爲日截留、存於日商橫濱正金銀行、今「蘇浙皖稅務總局」竟設立「駐關監查處」、推行其偽「印花」、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>偽局設駐關監查處</p>
<p>江海關大厦之中央銀行收稅處、自被日商橫濱正金銀行派員非法接收後、中央銀行收稅人員均已撤退、關於江海關一切稅收、由日商橫濱正金銀行派員辦理、今「蘇浙皖稅務總局」已於昨日起、在該收稅處設立駐關監査處、實行其所謂監査進出口各種統稅貨品、推行其「維新政府」之「印花稅票」、聞已定本月十三日起實行監査、同時派員開始辦公、</p>
<p>企圖推行偽「印花」</p>
<p>「蘇浙皖稅務總局」之佈吿內容略云、「爲佈吿事、査前蘇浙皖統稅局向有駐關辦事處之設置、因事變暫時中正、茲「本局」與江海關當局商妥、復設「駐關監査處」、以便監查進出口各種統稅貨品、定於本月十三日開始辦公、嗣後凡持有海關進口稅繳納證、曁海關出口及轉口稅繳納證者、一律須向該「監査處」、每張購買二分票面之印花貼於該證之上、以資證明、而便査騐」、</p>
<p>外商堅決反對貼用</p>
<p>記者昨向關係方面探悉財政部蘇浙皖統稅局自奉令撤退之後、對於海關進出口以及轉口稅繳納證、貼印花之事暫行停頓、玫由各進出口商自行貼花、此决僞「蘇浙皖稅務局」之設「監査處」、雖規定每張貼花二分、較以前每張减少二分、但其目的爲推行其所謂「維新印花」、因「維新印花」發行之後、各界一律拒絕、以致毫無成績之可言、至本埠外商對此事、已表示堅決反對、</p>
<h3>先施怠工風潮　昨日談判解決　資方表示在廿日前切實答復　今晨總支店一律均稪營業</h3>
<p>南京路先施公司總支店中低級職工七百餘人、前因所提改善待遇條件、未蒙當局採納、怠工以來、於茲兩天、値此冬令、營業旺盛時間、非特公司損失浩大、即全體職工之精神、亦異常痛苦、昨日下午四時、工部局工業科、特派顧炳元·高延根·再度與公司當局商洽調解方案、於八時再召集同人代表沈芝蘭·王煒·朱公亮·吳明全·萬春生·鮑北鴻·六人作三方面之妥商、關於職工等所提出之四項條件、共同議決、（一）所要求恢復補工三天、今將此三天即作爲津貼費、如將來同業有增加補工時、則依照辦理、（二）一律津貼五元、可以辦到、惟數目多少、須俟香港總公司示復、（三）年終分派紅利、亦電請總行示復辦理、（四）對職業保障、公司向不執行絕對保障、並在三方面會商決定、至遲於本月二十日以內、切實答復、至此該公司之怠工風潮、方吿全部解決、今晨總支店一律復工、據該公司代表昨晚語大中社記者、在此怠工期內、承社會各界、前往慰問、並餽贈各種物品、感激之餘、惟有益自奮勉、以期母負衆望、</p>
<h3>二電報局職員　要求加薪</h3>
<p>愛多亞路丹麥商大北水綫電報公司·英商大東水綫電報公司·美商太平洋水綫電報公司報差、僉以三公司自交通部上海電報局及國際無綫電台撤退後、營業增加數倍、公司當局均有盈餘、兼之物價日漲、生活困難、故於昨日聯名呈請三公司當局、酌加薪水並加米貼、聞公司當局對於全體報差之要求、日內即可給予圓滿答復、</p>
<h3>偽警越界被　警捕攔阻　誤入勞勃生路　勸阻後即離去</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、大道警察一隊、昨（十一日）晨因迷途而循勞勃生路下行、被公共租界巡捕攔阻、旁觀者預料將起衝突、但雙方並未發生糾紛、旋美陸戰隊巡邏隊數度往該區巡行、俾指點續有迷途之大道警察、先是該隊武裝大道警察在小沙渡路以西四分之一哩處、公共租界邊界大鐵門前、未遭攔阻、直至循勞勃生路下行、始遭値崗附近之巡捕出而勸阻、數分鐘後、大道警察即行離去、美陸戰隊因勞勃生路在其防區內、乃派兵協助警務人員、數度前往勞勃生路鐵門前巡邏、並未發生事故、</p>
<h3>傳偽法院對兩華捕竟提公訴　據稱明日將宣怖「罪狀」</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日商一新申報」今日（十二日）載稱、日方卵翼下之「地方法院滬西分院」之「檢察官」、對於日兵所捕公共租界華捕兩名、已繕具公訴狀、其全文將於明日宣布云、至於指該兩捕確犯何罪、則未經披露、（按該兩華捕爲一二一〇號與一六五〇號）、上月十九日與西捕頭艾格堡及女檢查員在勞勃生路遭日方扣留、但艾格堡与女检查员被禁五小时後、均已释出、</p>
<h3>蘇州河北售「軍用票」幕後顯有指使　由具有資力者主持其事　近日更形活動頗堪重視</h3>
<p>字林報云、自日方在華中侵佔區强用軍用票以還、蘇州河各橋樑上出兌軍用票者、益形活躍、幕後顯有主持此事者在、但記者未能探悉其人耳、聞與此問新政權有關之華人與日人、對此兌換軍用票事、刻正加以密切注視、記者昨赴北四川路橋一行、見此輩出兌軍用票者、</p>
<p>交易頗繁</p>
<p>以法幣兌換、貼水二角五分至四角不等，若輩立於橋頭、如收票員然、見過橋入內地者、即叩以有無軍用票、蓋侵佔區內之火車公共汽車與日人店舖、僅收軍用票也、其兌換率爲法幣一元三角二分合日軍用票一元、質言之、華人持法幣而入被佔之內地、則將</p>
<p>遭受損失</p>
<p>但此輩出兌軍用票者、殆不能稱之爲非法貿利、蓋若輩猶如其他小販、藉此博微利以糊口也據調査所悉、若輩兌出一元、獲利五至七分視出兌額之多寡而定、如有人兌軍用票數元、則其兌換率或係法幣一元四角、若所兌額巨大、則兌換率或將减至法幣一元三角、四川路各兌換店並不出兌小額軍用票、僅作</p>
<p>鉅額交易</p>
<p>如易軍用票千元、則需法幣一千二百餘元、在橋頭出兌軍用票者、共約五十人、若輩承認幕後有具更大資力之人主持其事、但不願披露此慕後人之姓名、彼等操此微業、已歷數月、但近來更爲活動、因日人在侵佔區內强迫流通軍用票、旅客購火車票等均需此種軍用紙幣也、若輩且有軍用分票出兌、並警吿旅客在游擊隊所據守之區、切勿使軍用票、</p>
<h3>返國華僑無業可謀　聯袂搭輪返籍</h3>
<p>受歐戰影響失業返國之浙籍華僑、先後抵滬者、共有三百餘人、一部份業於上月間分批搭輪赴甬、轉返原籍、茲悉其中八十餘人、本擬在滬另謀生計、但經一月來之多方設法、均無相常職菜可獲、彼輩且多寄寓旅社、每日開支浩大、爰已於前昨兩日聯袂搭海福海達兩輪前往寗波、轉返溫州及靑田原籍、</p>

<h3>工部局預算虧空　硏究彌補辦法　勢必增加損稅但未確定　借款詳情年杪始能公怖</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥今（十二日）晨接見記者時、預料工部局估計本年度虧空逾六百萬元之結果、公共租界內不久將有增加捐稅之必要、費氏述及工部局財務處長報吿稱、觀此報吿、可知一切、本年此時發表工部局財政狀况之完全文吿、志在使</p>
<p>公衆知悉　狀况、工部局財政委員會不久將準備明年度之財政報吿與預算、並將企圖獲得財務處長建議之助、以解決難題、重大之虧空、勢必使公共租界內增加捐稅、但此乃財政委員會將加研究之事、渠若預料委員會之決議、則屬謬誤云、記者指出、關於工部局</p>
<p>債務詳報</p>
<p>並未包括於本年度預算財政報吿之內、費氏聲稱、渠對工部局借款、尙無可言者、工部局認借款爲「固定」債務、故未曾刋佈借款之詳報、須至年杪、始能公佈局方借款之情况、費氏繼乃重申其信念、謂本年度重大虧空之結果、其</p>
<p>解決之法</p>
<p>厥唯增加捐稅、但此事將於工部局財務處長提出建議後、交財政委員會加以決定、預算財政報吿中關於「東區復興」一項、並非述及工部局新近出售其在公共租界北都之建築物與產業、惟指居民返該區、復行修建屋宇與住宅而言、</p>
<h3>追悼馬相伯　展期舉行　籌備委員會昨議決　延至下月星六舉行</h3>
<p>上海各界追悼馬公相伯籌備委員會、自上月八日成立以來、積極進行追悼事宜、原定本月廿九日舉行追悼大會、但因事務紛繁、是日恐不及舉行、該會爲重行決定追悼日期及進行辦法、特於昨日下午四時在銀行俱樂部舉行各組聯席會議、到各組代表四十餘人、公推李文杰主席、首由李君報吿該會成立經過、該會規程組織系統及各組委員人名後、即開始會議、當經議決、（一）追悼日期十二月廿九日不及舉行、延期至下月、於三個星期六日中檢定一日、舉行追悼、會塲即行接洽、（二）追悼大會經費之籌措、先發函各機關團體邀請參加、由各機關團體認捐、不足之數、由各籌備委員自行籌集、但以十元爲限、（三）大會預算待經費籌集後再行决定、一切以節省爲原則、（四）會塲佈置、追悼程序等、另行決定、討論至六時許、即散會、</p>
<h3>越南政府　徴用車輛</h3>
<p>本埠中法快運社、對滬昆聯運向由西貢安南轉道、近因擴充業務、特闢托倫綫、並設辦事處、擬在滬承裝客貨、即由托倫轉運昆明、惟該社近接西貢來電、謂托倫運輸車輛、全部被越南政府微甩、任何客車不能通過、故在最近、此新闢之路綫、乃無法打通、所有由滬運昆客貨、仍祗能經西貢轉道、因此定本月十五日離滬之法郵杜美輪、客貨更爲擁擠、</p>
<h3>職婦俱樂部主席　茅麗英昨遭鎗擊　昨晚行經南京路四川路　突遭兇徒狙擊身中三彈　腹部被中一彈勢甚危殆</h3>
<p>南京路近四川路口第一百二十弄附近、於昨日下午七時許、曾有一女子、由該弄中走出、該女性足登革履、服裝入時、當伊方經步出弄口、正擬向西行走之際、突有一身穿西服之少年、自隱處躍出、緊步追上、並起過該女、居前而行、詎料彼此行未數武、該少年忽然轉身</p>
<p>面露獰態</p>
<p>將伊阻住去路、該女子猝遇斯境、不覺悄急而號、而該少年即於斯際懷出手槍、向其開放三槍，從旁而逸、比經崗捕聞警、報吿捕房、派探馳往兜捕、則該行兇少年已失所在、當由第十二號西探將受傷女子飛送仁濟醫院救治、經該院醫師診騐之下、發覺子彈擊中該女大腹、未曾穿出、一彈中腿部、一彈中足部、因流血甚多、故</p>
<p>勢極危殆</p>
<p>至於伊之姓氏、據稱名茅麗英年二十八歲、寗波人、現住霞飛路啟秀女校內、在本市婦女職業俱樂部內任主席、案情如何、殊難臆斷、刻下捕房方面對此甚爲重視、正極力偵索中、據本報記者事後調查、得悉傷者前曾供職海關、並執敎鞭於學校、因其尙係未婚、且又儉的、故</p>
<p>個人生活</p>

<h3>愛多亞路槍聲密集　盜匪中彈成擒　自北海路搶刦菜館逃逸　崗捕剿一匪中十一彈　路人一名彈穿胸部畢命</h3>

<p>存款手續</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>本屆大學　統一招生考試概况（三）　敎部黃龍先科長之概述</h3>
<p>（五）　評分的標準</p>
<p>閱卷與計分、是考試成績的評判、其重要不亞於命題、統考的閱卷與記分等事、不是統一招生委員會直接負責、而是由各招生區負責辦理、可是、事先是由統參會規定一種閱卷和評分的標準、使各區有比較一致的辦法、因爲分區太多、地域太廣、試卷太多、交通太困難、事實上不得不如此做法、今年應考學生共計兩萬零六人、每人至少有七本試卷、一共有試卷十四萬本以上、遠的考區如上海延平等區、運輸的時間、至少在一個月以上、評閱試卷、以每人每天至多看一百本計、假定十天看完、十四萬本試卷、需要一百四十人、如果要集中閱卷、在運輸上、時間上、人事上都不允許、所以不得不採取分區閱卷的辦法、閱卷計分的標準、因爲不是一種新法考試、事實上頗難有極客觀的標準、所以只定了幾項比較客觀的原則、（一）命題委員除擬就試題外、並須擬定各題評分標準一份、就各題可能的情形、擬全對·半對·不對三等、或優·良·中·下·劣五等、並說明各題各等應給的分數、總分以一百爲率、（二）各科試題須由閱卷委員分題評閱、按照上條所開評分標準給分、（三）體育術科另定標準、以上三項、規定雖覺簡單、但重要的原則却已包括在內、還有一點、分區閱卷、有國立大學的考區當然不成問題、沒有國立大學的地方、爲事實上便利起見、不得不規定閱卷區、如蘭州·恩施·泰和·永康·曲江·鎭平六區、是以南鄭·重慶·桂林·浙大分校爲其閱卷區、這樣、就不致感覺困難了、</p>
<p>（六）　保送及優待辦法的規定</p>
<p>統考除考試錄取以外、還兼採保送制度、理由我在前節巳經說過了、去年保送免試升學學生高中會考及格者、以前列百分之十五爲限、國立中學畢業生、以畢業成績列甲等（總平均分數在八十分以上）爲限、如成績列甲等超過各該校高中畢業生百分之十五時、以成績較優之百分之十五爲限、今年規定較爲嚴格、高中畢業會考、以前列百分之十爲限、較去年减少白分之五、國立中學保送優秀畢業生免試升學、則完全取消、可是今年除會考省份得依規定保送免試升學外、尙有先修班與淪陷區省份可以保送之規定、先修班得保送成績最優前列百分之二十五、淪陷區得保送本年高中畢業生百分之二十、先修班創辦的本旨、是爲救濟去年未參加統考或參加而未錄取的學生予以先修的機會、其性質乃高中與大學之間的一種預備學校、與從前之大學預科相彷彿、而實際非大學預科、因爲大學預科是無試騐升入大學、而先修班入大學、尙仍須經過入學試騐、先修班修業期滿無所謂資格、但事寳上比高中畢業生多一年的訓練、所以不能不有保送免試升學的辦法、淪陷區因爲環境特殊、赴考不易、事實上亦不能不有保送的規定、而且有此必要、此外、本年還有兩種優待的辦法、一爲業藏學生、一爲海外僑生、蒙藏地處邊疆、學生程度、當然不能與內地學生比擬、海外僑生、因僑居海外、所受之敎育、與祖國不同、考試上不能不採取優待辦法、從寬錄取、這種辦法、本來就是法令所規定的、</p>
<p>（七）　同等學力的限制</p>
<p>大學招收同等學力學生、從去年起、才有這個新的規定所謂同等學力、當然是有與高中畢業同等的學力、換一句話說、就是高中雖未畢業、而其學力與高中畢業相等、不是資格問題、而是程度的問題、在大學組織法公布以前、以同等學力考大學是法令所許可的、因爲考試的方法不嚴、未免流於寬濫、因將此項規定取消、考試全憑資格、許多的天才生、難免不因這個限制而被埋沒、因此、去年統考特准同等學力報名考試、惟規定錄取人數不得超過錄取總數百分之十、今年規定更較嚴格、同等學力學生報考時、須具詳細履歷書、錄取人數不得超過錄取總數百分之十、並應以每區錄取學生總名次前半爲限、錄取百分比雖同爲百分之十、但方法郤比較嚴格多了、</p>
<p>除以上所述的七點以外、還有兩件最重要的事、一件是錄取的標凖、一件是分發的方法、因爲這兩件是統考的骨幹、只好在後面另節叙述、我們再綜合來看、今年統考與去年不同的地方、是（一）今年考區多、分處多、分佈較爲普遍、（二）招考的學校多、上海各院校亦均加入、（三）試題是統一的、（四）保送的比例小、（五）同等學力限度較嚴、（六）蒙藏生及海外僑生得從寬錄取、（七）投考學生多、錄取的百分比小、（八）分發除以志願及成績爲標準外、並顧及區域、却是採用去年成法、統考本是一種創制、有去年這樣完善的成規可循、我們却不能不感謝去年主持者的努力、</p>

<h3>糧食　日方有與租界當局　協力消弭米恐慌說　果眞到源無阻……米價可以平落　但望　限價實行……中次嚴格照別</h3>
<p>昨日內地各帮來源、雖亦祗到十餘車、而市面自經實施限價後、論大勢應難操縱、早市開手、客販旣都亟亟求脫、而囤戶及投機家前所囤進之貨、亦繼續出檔、市上回籠貨充斥、交易旣稀、各價即步步下落、將及中市、無論粳糯本客失價、均貶低一元有奇、直至近午、各貨跌透之餘、本鄕店胃藉事問津、乃形勢漸轉活絡、喊聲亦步步回昂、然結果終以早市各價業已貶透、雖稍回漲、較前市尙見降短三四角至五六角不一、邇來滬上米價高漲、緣於狼狽爲奸、互相利用、在上海近郊之米價、均不過二十二三元、（北橋漕河涇等處）故有用脚踏車前往販運、每次可帶四五斗、經二三轉回、獲利可在十餘元、因之引起日方之忌、遂有前日扣留此項脚踏車乃至四百餘輛之多、（見昨報）又聞閔行扣留米船爲數甚衆、帆檣如林、逗遛不行、若此等米仍能接濟滬市米、想操縱者雖有大力者爲後盾、亦有所爲難、如今聞日方發言人巳有表示願竭力協助兩租界當局以解決米糧之投機問題、又稱日軍爲表示其合作之誠意起見、當於日內輸送大批米糧來滬、藉以平衡供求不勻之市價、直至本埠米糧恐慌完全解决之時為止、此係法文日報所載、果如此說、上海米糧之來源、當不虞阻滯、米價大有平落之望、然必市塲有嚴密之管理、母任城狐社鼠作祟而後可、市上頗有少數奸商將决米售限價、而將好一等米竟有索五十四兀之風聞、要知限價自係指特頭號米而言、中次理應照別、但欲别價、又在執行者之努力、及同業有無整頓之決心耳、本報昨日社評已有論及矣、</p>
<p>客秈在嚴厲執行限價中、晨間曾有囤戶求脫、且長江來源亦未間斷、故市氣逐平、早市一度跌去元半、後市舖作趁小吸收、市又回站、結果較小一元左右、售開高客秈三十七元次至三十六元不等、共計二千包、</p>
<p>洋米新到一船外、尙有四萬多包可於今日抵埠、且行號客國均有回出、早市曾見猛跌一元半以上、但價小又復動銷、後市回好半元許、統計開現貨三千包、西貢價三十七元半次至三十六元、碎米三十三元、回籠路貨的開四五百噸、原包初開四十四元繼又回至四十四元半、定貨不劃、據洋商電訊二號米亦須四十四五元云、</p>
<h3>操縱民食　注重麵粉</h3>
<p>粉市自米價限制、囤戶暫無用武之地、稍避風頭、乃移其操縱於與米糧有同樣價値之麵粉、由來已數日、昨市廠盤繼長增高、二號粉改爲八元五角、比前又漲一角、各廠對客銷雖加價三角或四角、尙不肯出售、故市塲回籠貨日益昂挺、綠砲東粉已漲至八元九角及九元者、惟下午形勢一度較懈、良以租界當局、取締米糧囤積、頗爲嚴厲、投機者不無戒心、聞日廠粉以新囤觀望、鳳凰牌十二月份已回至八元一角七八分、一月份亦小至八元五角六七分云、</p>
<p>麥市漲風尤熾、因來源時阻、執貨者一味居奇、各廠與囤戶進胃俱佳、致市面益見俏利、阜豐廠進辦蘇常管蕪麥共二千包、已達十四元二角之新高價、市塲交易、亦有二十車之多、計開蘇州麥十四元零七分、丹陽麥十四元、常州麥十三元九角、</p>
<h3>金融　財部勸誡勿再買賣　金市浮多不乏脫手　惟港帮仍在拖進</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、趨勢轉疲、蓋因外滙鬆硬、及報載財部特電令四行曁市商會等、飭即轉致勸誡滬地各銀樓勿再行私自買賣、故有一部份浮多鑒於如此環境中、暫時遂懷脫手之念、是以塲中籌碼頗見充斥、幸港帮仍未改變其一貫作風入市扒吸、且大戶多頭心思尙佳、逢小不時撈進加碼、故結果祇軋小二十四元、晨開即因滙市頗鬆影響、一跌三十四元、以四千一百五十元開盤、繼以香港帮及某錢兌業先後猛扒、一度昂達四千一百七十五元、午刻滙市復鬆、港帮亦已停進、故午收祇有叫千一百五十八元、午後情勢平淡、結果爲四千一百六十元收盤、全天交易零多躉少、但其數仍有二千餘兩、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌念四元</p>
<p>晨每條（十兩）、初開因滙市開後即鬆、故塲中一時賣氣瀰漫、銀樓帮及錢兌業競相撳價求售、延至九時三十五分開市、即降落三十四元、錢兌業吐予金號一十兩、爲四千一百五十元、後處於賣風下又小十元、達四千一百四十元低盤、其中某金號及證券帮均有吸納、嗣以外滙止鬆回軟、故賣者漸少、逐步回高至四千一百五十元時、香港帮忽起買風、力委某銀樓及金號代買、故又步漲十餘元、其間某金號及證券帮等獲利乘機復出不少、此後因外滙回軟、且某錢兌業吃胃健旺、再升十元、證券帮售予銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千一百七十五元、旋以滙市硬化、買者漸少、銀樓帮及錢兌業頻來塞出、重降爲四千一百五十元、午刻因某金號重來撈入、遂高起五元、金號進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百六十元、繼之銀樓帮吐予金號二十兩、爲四千一百五十八元作午收價、午後初開因滙市帶硬、故即疲落八元、現金號售予錢兌業十兩、爲四千一百五十元、後因港帮扒吸百數十兩、拉起十四元、錢兌業進金號十兩、爲四千一百六十四元、入後港帮中止活動、且銀樓帮仍有賣胃、復降爲四千一百五十元、後因某金號拖入數十兩、頓回上十元、金號進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百六十元作晚收價、結果照上日軋跌二十四元、全天祇三十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進須减小二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金回落五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百二十五元、迨至九時三十八分掛小五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸四百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减小十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外滙市塲　買戶稀少</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、趨勢於鬆懈之中、尙能站穩、蓋以匯豐某行等均有鉅額吃進、故結果祇軋鬆〇六二五及一五六二五、當日經過、晨開因美英匯兌猛漲一分、致開市　勢遂吿英平美鬆、嗣因港雷拋塞爲先、再以華商紗花帮等吐售繼後、遂見步硬九時二十分、已見四辦士五六二五及七元半鬆價、其中某行匯豐等外行吃進不少、未幾進口商見景扒入、是以爲狀回軟、一度曾喊過四辦士五一六二五及七元四〇六二五、但上價鮮聞成交、旋以買者絕跡、且外行頗有供意、重行不支、再吿硬化、迄至午收爲四辦士五四六八七五及七元四六八七五、午後市勢靜中續略帶硬、蓋外行華比暨港電等均有塞出、故結果以四辦士五六二五及七元半收盤、至期貨交易、雖不乏做開、但潛勢仍與現貨相同、</p>
<p>滙豐結進稍轉穩</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均長一八七五、紐約銀僭仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法等各匯俱平、美對英漲二分、對滬未更、對法大一分七五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士半、美匯七元三七五、較之前收、英平美鬆〇三一二五、乃匯兌上漲之故、開後港電首來塞出、同時華商紗花帮等亦來競賣、故市况即見鬆動、計港電與華商售予有利某行及匯豐等現貨英金四辦士五三一二五及五六二五、並現貨美匯七元四三七五、再本月份美匯爲七元半、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉昂一分、此後賣風已息、故狀態遂定、不久進口商忽來扒吸、致市勢遂稍回軟、計洋行結進外行現貨英金四辦士五三二二五、及現貨美匯七元四三七五、後後又喊軟至四辦士五一六二五及七元四〇六二五、但未聞成交、旋以外行賣意轉濃、且扒者已吿絕跡、故爲狀復又趨鬆、某美行復吐予匯豐本月份美匯七元半、迄至午後、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士五四六八七五、美匯七元四六八七五、比晨開英鬆〇四六八七五、美硬〇九三七五、</p>
<p>英美收盤續見鬆</p>
<p>後市交易、仍甚淸稀、惟狀况續略形鬆態、計某華行吐予錢兌業美金票七元半、後華比亦售予同行本月份美匯七元半、同時聞港電亦賣予外行現貨美匯七元半、英金則極少做開、入後情狀更沉寂之至、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士五六二五、美匯七元半、本月份英金四辦士五四六八七五、美匯七元四六八七五、正月份英金四辦士五三一二五、美匯七元三七五、結果比上日現期英均鬆〇六二五、美俱硬一五六二五、</p>
<p>香港滙少榮辱</p>
<p>香港十二日電、今晨滙市開盤平平、英匯現期貨仍吿不動、美匯現貨鬆一二五、爲二十四元四三七五、日匯現貨跟長半元、爲一百零四元二五、申匯現貨回跌三元、爲三百二十八元、九時四十五分、申匯現貨續降一元、爲三百二十六元、十一時三十分平平均無榮辱、下午二時三十分開盤、仍無變動、</p>
<p>天津美滙出七元</p>
<p>天津十二日電、今晨匯市開盤堅定、英匯現貨續鬆一二五、爲四便士三一二五、美匯現貨續長一八七五、爲七元〇六二五、申匯降二元、爲一百零六元、「聯鈔」暗盤微賤五角、爲九十三元半、</p>
<h3>外幣續鬆</h3>
<p>昨日英美金錢金票供給較相、市况疲弱、美金票晚市跌爲十三元三角四分、港票法郞供給見殷、市價鬆降、新荷票無甚需要、市價軟弱、坎票亦賤、日金票需要頗盛、市價堅秀、晚市爲一元二角五分、朝鮮票亦堅挺、晚市爲一元一角三分五厘、昨日英金鎊降一角、金票降二角半、美金鎊降五角、金票降二角、港票降一分、法郞降五厘、坡票降五分、荷蘭降一角、安南降三分、坎票降二角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>貼現退至四十五元</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、步低漸勁、每千元晨間即低爲四十七元、繼更不支、步降至午刻爲四十五元半、下午續稍退爲四十五元、比前日再軋小二元五角、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍開一角五分云、</p>
<h3>證券　大批橡皮股　獲利了結　內債依然相持中</h3>
<p>證證暗盤、昨日市况、仍係沉默待時、毫無動靜之象、各帮交易更見稀少，惟環境潛勢、變化甚鉅、雖有脫穎之日、昨日公債趨勢、仍未脫多日來固有之窠臼、市價上落仍升沉於五分一角間、醞釀擯持不减毫厘、故結果仍係高低互見、爲數五分一角至二角、成交總數的計二三十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交雜糧交易所股五十股價爲十元正、衆業公所報吿、股市交易、除少數例外、幾全被橡皮股所壟斷、開盤市况復極激昂、轉瞬間即有大批獲利者起而了結、漲勢遭遇頓挫、嗣又再度趨堅、較全日最高時稍低價下、買戶擁擠、最受歡迎者、爲多種作價低賤之股、如陳氏·加倫丹·地傍及里派等、其作價高昂者、當推蘭格志股、對於實業股興趣仍微、祇國際信託。上海銀公司·瑞鎔·及祥泰木行等股尙形活躍、祥泰木行股頃已漲達三十四元、</p>
<p>倫敦十一日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市大致均吿平定、僅開平煤礦不記名股續跌六便士、價爲十七先令、</p>
<p>倫敦十一日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、有四種跌落、計英法借款（英發）猛跌五鎊、價爲四十五鎊、善後借款（英發）跌三鎊、價爲三十五鎊、克利斯浦與京滬鐵路各跌二鎊、前者爲廿五鎊、後者爲十八鎊、其餘平平、</p>
<h3>紗花　脫貨心切　紗價下墜　念支再跌十元</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、氣勢渙散、此因二十支棉紗存貨太厚、連漲數日、獲利者已有數十元可得、業已脫手求財、於是檯面一鬆、賣風更盛、市盤反形不支、乃傾向下墜、然海外棉市、印棉已穩定、惟美棉一味前進、然鑒於前者情形、人心米能激起、不過原料高貴、將後之成本、勢必提高也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開稍有一部份搶帽子之流互相在喊、二十支雙馬做開價爲七百三十五元、比上日漲七元、成交十包、此盤一開、求售者甚衆、然竟乏人接受、市况乃疾趨下降、後聞外匯稍軟、人氣愈見懈怠、直跌至七百十八元收盤、以後略見回升、査半日成交二千〇三十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十一元、雙地球跌十元、天女跌十元、廠方由新裕廠開出二十支雙地球本月份六百包、價爲七百十元、下月份六百包、價爲七百二十五元、今日有六十件紗運港、三十件運海口、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<h3>美棉出口津貼　减為二十磅音　本市廠辦沉寂</h3>
<p>本棉交易略見平靜、廠方仍無活動氣象、人心帶平、因紗價不能積極上升、而走勢不廣、廠方乃不願吃原料、然外棉如此昂騰、仍以本棉爲廉、所以同行成交雖見减色、然市價看鬆者居少數也、白包花價大致予上日不相上下、蘇丹花係製紡三十二支原料、已售二百二十六元、紡織四十二支之巴西棉原料、市上討價要二百五十元、蘇北來源又見淸寂、碼頭上僅到通州花八百四十九包、又北沙來三千六百七十包、今日有一百二十包運港、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>沖通　一六二·〇〇同業進一五二包</p>
<p>通州　一六七·一〇又　六六包</p>
<p>細絨打包　一八二·〇〇又　一〇〇包</p>

<p>火草包　一五七·五〇又　一〇〇包</p>
<p>又白包　一五八·五〇又　一八〇包</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、異常挺秀、因海外棉商之極力爭購、出口津貼日益乾涸、昨日美氏農部秘書亨利威爾斯又公布减去出口津貼二十磅音、現在美棉出口所能貼到者祇有僅餘之二十磅音矣、各方深信此僅餘之二十磅音、於最短期內、亦將取銷也、又據農長華萊十佔計自七月二十七日起按照出口津貼程序售出之棉已達五百七十萬包、華氏並預料一九四〇年八月一日滾存之棉將校上年度的少二百萬包、紐約市况、因各方競購之故、棉價又漲二十磅音、印度棉市平平、埃及又漲百餘磅音、利物浦則騰漲二十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、關於定貨方面、因美政府對於出口津貼之一减再减、及棉市飛漲、故交易日趨淸淡、各方俱抱觀望、然同業間因前訂之貨、俱司賺取厚利、極願脫貨求現、故彼等售價較洋行廉多也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙七元四三七五、折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支美米特林　二三四·九五</p>

<h3>實施家庭冬防的建議</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>朔風怒吼，氣候暴冷，寒暑上的水銀柱，退到了最低的度數，厚厚的衣裳，都從衣箱里搬出來，穿上了身體。掛在樹梢上的枯葉，也一片片地隨風飄落，大地間一切的一切，都象徵是嚴重的季節了。</p>
<p>竊盜，火災，原是在這嚴寒的冬季里最猖獗的時期。欲避免這種不幸事件，必須有精確的預防，所以筆者要建議實施這家庭冬防的運動，使每宅房屋中的居戶，共同提起互助的精神，共負這家庭安全的責任，不但可避免自己一切意外的損失，和不幸的遭遇，而且可養成有紀律的良好習慣！</p>
<h3>預防火災的建議</h3>
<p>在臥室里：（一）切不可放置煤球爐，風爐，火油爐等。更其是在這嚴寒的冬季里，每有人貪　時的溫暖，以煤球爐移至臥室里，因此而中煤毒，引起火災的不幸事件，在昔日的報上，已屢有所聞。這二種不幸的遭遇都能把性命作爲無謂的犧牲。（二）睡在牀上的時候，應絕對禁止吸捲烟。若一時疏忽，捲烟頭掉在被窩上，雖此星星之火，亦能成爲燎原，而竟至不可收拾。（三）火柴，燃着的蠟燭頭，煤油燈等，都需放在固定的安全地方。若有極易燃燒的物件（如賽路璐的玩具，油紙，棉花之類），都應　之隔離。（四）字紙簍　痰盂，切不可排列在一處。萬一誤以捲烟頭投入字紙簍里，亦易引起火災。（五）在房間門口的出入處，不可放置任何雜件，假使突遇事變，因此可不障礙出入，此點亦須加以注意。</p>
<p>在廚房里：（一）煤球須儲藏在木箱里，木柴應堆積在適當的地方，並且都。須遠離爐竃油類流汁，在不需要的時候，切莫放在爐竃附近。（二）引火用的小木柴木花等，需放在安全的地方。（三）竃上的烟囱，有無漏洞，有無烟火冒出。爐竃中的灰燼，有無遺漏在地上。在晚上入睡之前，應把爐竃中的餘燼，細心地完全退盡。（四）煤球爐必須放置在指定的地方，切不可東放一隻，西放一隻，甚至於房門口亦放一隻，薄薄的洋松室板，日久的被煤火熏灼，木質枯燥，極易着火，實含有危險性極大。簡單的說一句，除廚房之外，一概不應放置煤球爐或風爐之類。（五）若室中燃有火爐，應隨時檢視火紅的煤屑，以防掉在地板上，在入睡之前，亦應熄滅火爐中的燃煤。（六）露天的電綫和開關，亦須時常注意，有無損壞，以免漏電而引起火災，和觸電的危險。　（未完）</p>
<h3>搶棉花的一羣</h3>
<p>— 胡蒂</p>
<p>在同孚路口，幾輛滿載着棉花包的載貨車在交通燈前停了下來，這時候，藏匿在路角廣告牌底下的一羣流浪人，就像一羣兎子似的躥出來，他們等着紅綠燈交替的機會，用最敏捷的行動，在車後車旁，攫取那些色白如雪的棉花。坐在棉花包上的搬運夫，就把手裏的籐鞭向四週揮着，但是這驅逐的方法沒有發生效力，他們都懂得怎樣去避過鞭子的方向，即使眞的不幸而重重地着了一下，那末，在這刹那間的機會中，他可以博得更多的戰利品，因爲搬運夫在抽回鞭子的時候，他可以利用這間隙的時間，儘量地攫取。</p>
<p>路角上的行人，都被眼前的這幕喜劇攫住了視綫，站定下來觀看着。但是在第三輛載貨車開過巡警崗位的時候，一個搶棉花的漢子被搬運夫撤下一般繩索來扣住了頭頸，這幾如「封神榜」中的綑仙繩一樣，那漢子完全失去了知覺似的，跟着車子的加快速率而拖了過去。這更精彩的一慕，使路旁的觀衆鼓起掌來，有的也擁上前去，彷彿羅馬的獅心王，欣賞角力塲中的那些英武的戰士傷生在殘酷的武器之下一樣。</p>
<p>然而車子已在前面停了下來，幾個搬運夫跳下車來，把那漢子打了幾拳，駡了幾聲，重復開走了。——這結束或許是使觀衆們失望了。那個戰敗的武士呢，也太出人意料，他很快地翻身起來，沒有撫摩一下頸　上被繩索撕破的皮，也沒有拭抹一下面頰上被抓破的血痕，他俯下身來，祗是拾集剛才因戰鬥而失落到路上的棉花，那樣敏捷，拾滿了腰兜，才大踏步回到自己的陣地去——路角的廣告牌底下。他的同伴們也沒有一個注意他受了傷沒有，祇是拍拍他的肩頭，表示慶祝他的勝利。然後，大家把棉花放在一個大的紙袋中，在向陽的地方坐下來休息，看樣子，他們還等待着第二次的出征呢。</p>
<p>這幕戲結束以後，有一位觀衆發表意見了，他說：「那巡捕怎樣不問不聞呢？」</p>
<p>是的，這是搶刦！不過我們還記得一般因無以爲生，故意搶刦了路人的皮夾，而願意坐牢的新聞。這羣無以爲生的流浪人，繩索困住了頸　，被汽車拖着走，被搬運夫拳足交加的敲打，都不以爲意，而他們以生命來相搏的僅是不足一斤的棉花，法律對於這些人也衹能「充耳不聞」了。</p>
<p>不過，這是社會的隱憂，而這畸形發展的都市，又正在逼着他們踏上更危險的途徑，衣食足，而後知廉恥，搖頭歎息是沒有用的，而况現在是衣食足亦不知廉恥的時代呢！</p>

<p>現在吳君索知道金澹雲要她去，並不是要她去做女儐　的事，或者另有別事，也未可知。除了吳家姊妹以及邵慧華都有家在上海，不必去說她們外。此外如何家姊妹與朱愛人，都沒有家在上海，她們當然必須住旅館的了。何家姊妹本來是個豪華小姐身份，她們可以挑上海最大的旅館住，但知道朱愛人是位喜歡省儉的人，不喜歡住大旅館。因此她們商量着，揀一個中　旅館住，只要適合於衛生，不妨擇一個大房間，三人聚居一室。雖然金澹雲曾經打電話給朱愛人，她在萬國大旅館，定好了許多房間，敎她們也住到那裏去。但她們想：這反而不自由，還是自己去找旅館的好。所以這六個人到了上海像朱愛人是難得到上海來的，她必定自己開着汽車，到火車站去接她們。無奈今大她是太忙了，不但是要招待中國的親朋，還有一班外國吃喜酒的朋友，都得要自己略爲招待。雖然有許多有蘇理雅太太盡招待之責，蘇理雅太太自己親生的女兒，還沒有出嫁，現在到中國來，對於金澹雲，宛如中國女兒一般。不過蘇理雅太太雖然是位美國豪富，林建成余澹雲一對新夫婦，都是主張節儉的，在可省的地方，總以簡省爲主。因此他們的新家庭，只借了一所不十分寬闊的房子。倒也是個三層樓，房子是最新式的，地址是在上海西區。這屋子還是林建成打的樣子，這一排有好幾座房子，每座房子的建築式樣，各各不同。從前造房子，往往對於那種洋式房子，有稱爲法國式的，德國式的，英美式的。現在並沒有倣效各國式的觀念，建築工程師，自出心裁，打成圖樣，只要淸潔，衛生，舒適，美觀，這幾個條件都合了，管它是那國式的。這座屋子雖不大，庭院也還寬敞，人是離不開花木的，因此也雜蒔了花木。爲了現代所造的房子，往往是取標準化，都是同一個式樣的。而余澹雲有些討厭那個同一式樣，所以林建成思媚其婦，便選取了這裏的幾座房屋式樣不同，請她選取了一宅。　（　二四）</p>

<h3>攝影家徐銘會見紀</h3>
<p>— 銀鹽</p>
<p>從前偶然在一本英國倫敦出版的The　Amateur　Photographer雜誌上看見一幀非常雄偉的照片，主體是一艘巨艦，角度和取光都美麗奪目，下面說明是Hsu　Ming　shagai的作品。在外國的攝影刋物上向來很少見有我國攝影家的作品，這會子忽然看見了是上海的作品，拼音又明明白白的是國人，然而這個名字非但在國內沒有先見過，就是在各攝影團體之中，也找不到。當時只得悶在肚裏納罕。某一天的晚上，我因有事到靜安寺路去，偶然踏進了一爿蘇州糖果店，買些東西，在潔凈玻櫃上。却發現了一張悅目的松樹白雲的照片，拍得非常好，手法和以前的一本雜誌上所揭載的有同一雄拔之勢；我便疑心是出於一手的，仔細地打聽櫃員，才知道是他們的老闆徐君所作，但是他們只知道他的名字呌做「文熙」並不是Hsu　Ming</p>
<p>在我誠懇地要求見面的請求之下，徐先生果然出來了彼此交換了名片，才知道這位揚名海外的攝影名家的中文名字是「徐銘」二個字。文熙是他的號。因爲雙方志趣的相同，談得很爲投機。</p>
<p>他是一個年紀在廿五六歲左右的靑年，籍貫是浙江餘姚，雙目炯炯，瘦長而精神煥發，發音響亮，談吐尤爲爽利。我們傾談了一小時之後，便結了一個好朋友。</p>
<p>他嗜好攝影已有四五年之久。二年來參加國際各大沙龍，所獲獎狀獎章琳琅滿目，在國際間認爲是一個新的藝術家，並且加入了英國皇家攝影學會，而有更深的研究。</p>
<p>徐君並曾被英國皇家攝影學會選爲Associate的「藝術精通」的會員了，這個學位，資格學術並重，不容易被當選的，在我國尙屬第一人。</p>
<h3>賺錢妙策</h3>
<p>— 敏華</p>
<p>好萊塢某大戲院附近，住有一個墨西哥胖婦人，她想到了一個賺錢的妙計，就是當一張影片作第一次獻映的時候，她帶了四個孩子，買了五張四元錢的票子，坐在最好的位置上，以等待一般遲到的人向她買位置，當然價格隨便她討，最高記錄爲十一元，她靠此爲生，所以一個月的收入却也可觀。</p>
<h3>一封公開信　洛麗泰揚　寫給英國某雜誌</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>洛麗泰揚，在今日的好萊塢銀壇上，眞可以算得是一位數一數二的紅星了。她的新作“Eternally　Yo-urs”，譯名「心上人」，剛在本市南京大戲院放映完竣；各界仕女們，對她在該片內演出的動人，都表示萬分讚嘆。她曾給英國某雜誌寫一封公開信</p>
<p>在開頭，她這樣的說：「從影迷們的來信中，我知道一般觀衆，是隨時隨刻在望着當今的紅星，能够多拍幾部影片，多給他們一點深刻的印象。但這是不可能的，因爲一個演員當在開拍一部影片時，常常整日整夜的工作，所以，俟一部影片攝成後，必須獲得短時期的休養。爲此，就有許多演員，每年只拍三部影片，而我呢，最多時，亦不過八部。」</p>
<p>接着，她談了點關於她私人方面的瑣事，她說：「我現在住在貝爾愛埃（Bel　Air）地方，知道的人不多，倒亦可以避免不少無謂的糾紛。在拍片的過程中，我對於衣裝，特別留意，因爲常常有許多攝影記者纏繞着我。每逢假期，我到各地去游玩；但我的行院是神秘的，不然，恐怕又要受到意外的遭遇。」</p>
<p>其次，她說的是一個演員最低應具備的條件：</p>
<p>「第一，不可忽視觀衆們的意見及願望，否則，就不能獲得他們的擁戴，聲譽亦必定跟着日趨墮下。第二，不論一舉一動一言一語，尤其是一般女演員，應該處處留意。因爲常常有許多閒散之徒，喜歡拿我們來造謠或無中生有。」</p>
<p>最後，她說：「一個人應該穿得體面些，但不可太奢華；無事時不妨外面跑跑，但不能過份；在人生過程中，驕傲，浪費兩件事最要不得，到處我們應該抱着慈悲寬懷的態度。」</p>
<p>結束，她向影迷們下了一句警語：「在你們的目光中，常常認爲一個獻身銀幕的演員的一生工作是全無意義的，對於這句話，我將用實際的精神來消除它。」</p>
<h3>王晨在陝北</h3>
<p>— 裴斐</p>
<p>王晨，誰都知道她是「老虎」鄭君里的夫人。</p>
<p>王晨是蘇州人，但她生長在上的，啟秀女中畢業後，就進江灣上海商學院唸書。</p>
<p>她跟君里的相識，說起來是很偶然的。那是民國念四年，上海業餘劇人協會二次公演「欽差大臣」時的前一個星期，君里在金城大戲院排戲，一位姓區（？）的小姐（顧夢鶴的朋友）帶了王晨來參觀，她替他們隨便的介紹了；誰會想到僅僅這「一面之緣」，竟播下了他們倆人的情種，很快地在次年的十月念五日，便假八仙橋靑年會九樓的西廳結婚了呢？</p>
<p>八一三滬戰爆發後，這一對新婚的夫婦便離開上海的老家，參加救國演劇隊出發了。從無錫經蘇州轉南京而漢口，後來再抵重慶，自始至終，沒有離開戲劇者的崗位。</p>
<p>最近，從內地寄來的一封友人的信上，談到了他們的近况，說王晨最近進了陝北公學，天天和李琳（前明星女演員）在一塊兒討論着救國的理論，樣子是像非常努力的；她的丈夫君里，則在　州，稍稍逗留一些日子，恐怕就要回重慶去的。</p>
<h3>貫大元飾　（黃忠）</h3>
<h3>鄭冰如之（寳蓮燈）</h3>
<h3>李洪春飾　（關公）</h3>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>貫大元擅演永安宮漢陽院等老戲</p>
<p>該劇的情節，大概是演劉備汝南之役，爲曹操所敗，幸得孫乾之介，乃往依荊州牧劉表，表待之甚厚，惟惑於繼室蔡氏之言，竟遣備赴新野後表病危，始復召見，並托以後事。曹操知備終必爲己患，明修和好，而又暗自興兵，備得信，急趕回新野，自料衆寡不敵，遂携老幼百姓棄城而走。過荊州時，則劉表已死，守將蔡瑁張允聞曹操兵至，已勸表之次子琮投降曹操，備以有負寄托之重，不禁大慟，途經襄陽城東漢陽之原，謁劉表之墓，並爲文以哭之。以上乃該劇的簡單說明。這齣戲裏有西皮倒板、原板、流水、以及反西皮等，人謂劉備是梟雄，慣會假仁假義，要買人心，是以曹操佔天時，孫權得地利，劉備得人和，遂成鼎足之勢。但是備之哭劉表，實際上乃是哭給衆百姓看的，所以反西皮的詞裏乃有「實可歎樊城新野的好百姓，看他們一個個，扶老携幼，登山涉水，投奔途程，我好傷心！……」的一套要買人心的話，衆百姓聽了，當然寗死也不願離開了這位仁德之主。所以演此劇的角兒，第一須能將劉備愛民如子的神情表作出來，始可謂能得是劇之眞諦者。至於劇名雖曰哭劉表，然而主點還是在百姓身上。因劉之深得民心，實以此爲始，扮演者殊不可不知耳。大元抵滬，以色相示人，我很盼望他能將此類幾將失傳之老戲演出，預料必可大受歡迎也。（一五九）</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of the Guangdong-Guangxi War</h3>
<p>The Japanese army captured Nanning and advanced north in two directions, one along the Yongbin Highway towards Binyang and the other along the Yongwu Highway towards Wuming. On the Yongbin line, the Chinese and Japanese armies are stalemated between Yongning and Qitang. On the Yongwu line, they are stalemated between Yongning and Gaofengao. Although the full-scale battle has yet to unfold, observers predict that the most intense war will be fought in the mountains of Guangxi. Both China and Japan have dispatched reinforcements to the front and have deployed their lines in preparation for an offensive. Therefore, the Japanese occupation of Nanning is the beginning of the southern Guangxi war, not the completion of its war aim. From Beihai and the Qinzhou Bay, where the Japanese landed, to Nanning is less than 100 miles; utilizing the power of their army, navy, and air force, they could easily advance, but north of Nanning, it would be difficult to penetrate deep. The center of military gravity is in the suburbs of Nanning, but the military maneuvering of both sides and the mutual restraint between them causes ripples to spread across both Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. On the Yuehan Railway line, the Japanese remotely echo southern Guangdong, attempting to invade Yinzhanao from Lubaohua County, opening up the Yuehan Railway, moving north towards Hunan, and west towards Guangxi. This strategy has been crushed by the Chinese army. In the West River area, the Japanese wanted to pass through Zhaoqing Gorge from Sanshui and move north towards Cangwu to reinforce Nanning, but the Japanese army has never crossed the Sanshui line. As for eastern Guangdong, the Japanese used puppet troops to move from Chenghai to Huanggang, which belongs to Raoping, crossing Fenshui Pass and attacking Zhaoan in southern Fujian. Zhaoan was once occupied by the Japanese and puppet troops, but after strenuous counterattacks by the Chinese army and intercepting the enemy along the way, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Chenghai. Currently, the Chinese armies in Guangdong and Fujian have established contact. There is no trace of the Japanese army in the Fenshui Pass area on the border between Guangdong and Fujian. The Japanese utilization of bandits and puppets to invade Fujian, supposing they advanced along the highway and occupied the important towns of Zhangzhou in southern Fujian, based on the lack of naval activity in northern Fujian, appears to be pending. Therefore, the actual purpose of the Japanese is likely to support the war in southern Guangxi and divert the attention of the Chinese army, while the main purpose is not in southern Fujian.</p>
<p>The above is regarding the actions of the Japanese army. As for the Chinese army, it is also responding tit-for-tat and standing up against them. The main strategy of the Chinese army is to turn the rear of the Japanese army into the front. The area occupied by the Japanese army from Qinzhou Bay to Nanning is a narrow corridor. Although Qinzhou and Fangcheng have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, the Leizhou Peninsula and Lingshan County still have strong Chinese armies stationed there. If these troops are dispatched to the rear of the Japanese army, there will surely come a day when the Japanese corridor is cut off. Currently, a strong branch of the Chinese army in Lingshan, western Guangdong, is moving east, hoping to cut off the highway and recapture Qinzhou County. They have now recovered Xiaodong on the Guangdong-Guangxi border. Another strong branch of the Chinese army set off from Hepu and is advancing towards Qinzhou County. The two armies joined forces to attack and have now approached the suburbs of Qinzhou County. Regardless of whether this force can capture Qinzhou and Fangcheng in one fell swoop, cutting off the Japanese army's rear, these troops, by traveling back and forth behind the Japanese army and destroying transportation lines, will surely exhaust the Japanese army. The loss of one city or place is not enough to determine the overall situation. The loss of Nanning is just an empty city, with no manpower or material resources left. Since the Japanese army entered Nanning, they have had heavy troops counterattacking in front and an ambushing army in the rear. Not only will the Japanese army fail to achieve its goal of cutting off the Guangxi-Vietnam transportation line, but it will also be impossible to maintain transportation to and from its own front and rear. Therefore, it is no different than climbing a tree to catch fish for the Japanese army to penetrate deep into Guangxi, breaking through the Kunlun Pass, a strategic region, on the Yongbin line to the north, moving south along the highway to seize Longzhou, cutting off the Guangxi-Vietnam line, and invading Yunnan along Baise in the west to cut off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Japanese Prime Minister Abe recently gave a speech at a banquet in Osaka, saying that Chiang Kai-shek commands at least 240 divisions and that there are also one million guerrillas rampaging everywhere. He then urged the nation to prepare for a war lasting five to ten years. This means that although Japan has obtained Nanning, it has not gained any decisive strategic significance. On the contrary, it has taken a risk, further stretching the battle lines and adding another layer of difficulty to its troop deployment and supply. If China, in the Guangxi-South Campaign, uses a strong military force to hold the strategic area of Kunlun Pass on the Yongbin road, and sends troops from various places in southern Guangdong to the rear of the Japanese army, then the Japanese army, venturing deep, will be destined to fail. General Bai Chongxi's remarks yesterday that Nanning can be recovered and the Japanese army annihilated at any time are indeed possible and are definitely not just boasting!</p>
<h3>League of Nations Cables Soviet Union, Requests Ceasefire, Enters Conciliatory Negotiations, Dispatches Representatives to Attend the General Assembly, and Hopes to Submit a Reply Today</h3>
<p>Geneva: The Swedish representative recently suggested to the League of Nations General Assembly that a telegram be sent to the Soviet government requesting it to dispatch representatives to the meeting on the 13th of this month to discuss the application submitted by Finland. The Committee on Finnish Affairs organized by the General Assembly then unanimously resolved to send a telegram to the Soviet government requesting it to cease hostilities and dispatch representatives to attend the General Assembly on the 13th of this month in order to conduct peace talks with Finland under the auspices of the League of Nations, and hoped that the Soviet Union would submit a response before the 13th of this month. (11th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva: The League of Nations General Assembly today designated 13 countries to form a committee on the Soviet-Finnish dispute, without inviting China to participate. After the committee was established, it immediately accepted the British proposal to send a telegram to the Soviet government requesting it to immediately cease the war and send representatives to Geneva so that it could negotiate with Finland under the mediation of the League of Nations. When the British put forward this proposal, the French representative immediately expressed his approval. The committee also requested the Soviet Union to reply within 24 hours. Soviet semi-official sources here said that the committee's telegram was tantamount to an ultimatum. (12th Special dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva: The League of Nations General Assembly reconvened last night. Chairman Norwegian representative Hambro stated that all representatives must be prepared to meet at any time, day or night, in order to deal with the situation after receiving the Soviet Union's reply. Before the meeting, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Denmark sent a letter to the chairman stating that because the League of Nations General Assembly was convened specifically for a certain designated political event, it did not intend to participate in discussions on other political issues. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva: Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative to the League of Nations, said today that Britain and France both agree that China should be re-elected as a member of the League of Nations Council. According to the League of Nations charter, those elected as council members must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly. However, this General Assembly intends to simplify the original procedure, and China's re-election as a council member is almost certain. This morning, the General Assembly appointed Hu Shize, the Chinese Minister to Switzerland, as one of the nine members of the Review Committee, which was beyond general expectations. The press circles of various countries here said that this matter is sufficient to indicate that the League of Nations' sympathy for China has not changed. Regarding the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League, opinions are divided. South American countries strongly advocate the expulsion of the Soviet Union, while Scandinavian countries only advocate condemning the Soviet Union and providing practical assistance to Finland. Britain agrees with the views of the Scandinavian countries, and France's attitude is the same as Britain's. Britain believes that expelling the Soviet Union will promote close cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany and reduce the effectiveness of the Allied blockade policy. The Finnish representative also does not want to expel the Soviet Union, so that the Soviet Union and Finland can still hold negotiations or be mediated by other countries. (12th Special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Finnish Representative's Speech Requests Practical Assistance</h3>
<p>Geneva: The League of Nations General Assembly held its second meeting at 4:45 pm this afternoon to discuss the application submitted by the Finnish government and immediately decided to accept it. Holsti, the representative of the country, then delivered a speech amidst warm applause from representatives of various countries, recounting the period from the beginning of the Soviet army's invasion on the 30th of last month until the Finnish government submitted its application, and explaining what the country expected from the League of Nations. He said, "In the past, the Soviet Union condemned all acts of aggression by other countries, but now it has resolutely sent troops to invade our territory. The people of our entire country are now willing to support the government and resist. What we seek is not only the sympathy of various countries but also practical assistance. Our country's strength alone cannot resist the Soviet army. Finland is not only fighting for its own survival but also for the highest ideals of all nations in the world. Based on this position, we call on all countries to provide material assistance." The General Assembly then designated representatives from 13 countries, Britain, France, Uruguay, Bolivia, South Ireland, Egypt, Portugal, Venezuela, Siam, Sweden, Norway, Canada, and India, to form a committee to study this application.

<h3>Committee Drafts Report Advocating Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Geneva: The Committee on Finnish Affairs under the League of Nations General Assembly continued to hold meetings this morning, with Portuguese representative Damate as chairman. It immediately discussed the draft report that the General Assembly's presidium was about to submit to the General Assembly. The content detailed the course of events in which the Soviet Union and Finland engaged in hostile acts, and its conclusion supported the Swedish proposal, advocating for reconciliation between the two sides. This draft report will first seek the opinions of Finland before being submitted to the General Assembly for review. In addition, the committee is also drafting another report on the diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Finland and various legal issues, and is scheduled to hold another meeting at 5:30 pm today.

<h3>British Newspapers Express Sympathy for China's Situation</h3>
<p>London: Today, the newspapers here expressed sympathy for China's position in Geneva and the Chinese representative's decision to abstain from voting on the Soviet-Finnish dispute. The News Chronicle reported that many countries are forced by circumstances to only consider their own interests and are unable to uphold justice. China has no reason to sympathize with aggression, but it is inconvenient to offend the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union's continued assistance to China's war of resistance is extremely important. The League of Nations can now only condemn the Soviet Union in clear terms and urge all member states to assist Finland. Although the League of Nations cannot implement military force today, it can unite the attitudes of various countries so that one day an international organization can be created with the power to take decisive action against acts of aggression, no matter where they occur. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Hopes</h3>
<p>New York. Today, all newspapers here prominently published the League of Nations' telegram to the Soviet Union and reports of Finnish victories in resistance. The New York Tribune reported that the League of Nations, after most of its most important members withdrew, now has a new atmosphere, as member states can unite dramatically. The New York Times said that even if the League of Nations cannot make any united expression, countries will still be able to ensure that Finland receives all necessary supplies. The American people greatly admire Finland's struggle for freedom and its noble international character, and believe that ways can be found to provide prompt assistance. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>British and French Public Opinion</h3>
<p>London. The Finnish Committee of the League of Nations Assembly has telegraphed the Soviet government, requesting it to cease hostilities, conduct peace talks with Finland, and send representatives to the Assembly. This matter has been commented on by various newspapers here, asserting that the Soviet government will definitely refuse to accept, and the League of Nations will not necessarily impose sanctions on that country, but will only unanimously pass a resolution in the Executive Council to condemn it. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris. The request from the Finnish Committee of the League of Nations Assembly to the Soviet Union to cease hostilities has been commented on by various newspapers here. There are no high expectations about how the Soviet government will respond. The right-wing Le Petit Parisien stated, "If the Soviet government does not remain silent, it will submit an arrogant reply." The moderate L'Ordre stated that if the League of Nations were to announce the Soviet Union's expulsion, it would only strengthen the collusion between Hitler and Stalin. The leader of the Socialist Party, former Prime Minister Léon Blum, also published an article in Le Populaire, stating, "The Soviet Union's invasion of Finland must be judged. If the attitudes of Britain and France show any softening, their prestige will be swept away. However, what Finland requests is practical assistance, which cannot be satisfied by empty condemnation." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Indifference</h3>
<p>Moscow. This morning, Soviet newspapers completely ignored yesterday's League of Nations resolution. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Ridicule</h3>
<p>Rome. Italy's notification of its withdrawal from the League of Nations was sent on December 11, 1937, so it only takes effect today. Various newspapers here wrote articles yesterday discussing this matter, ridiculing the declining power of the League of Nations and the current Assembly. The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia stated that no one will regret the League of Nations losing its form, as the League had long lost its credibility. Il Giornale d'Italia commented that the League of Nations convening an assembly to discuss the issues of "aggression" and "sanctions" at this time is truly a twist of fate for the League. Needless to say, the current League of Nations Assembly will not have any results. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Continue to Advance, Finnish Defense Line Remains Intact</h3>
<p>London. According to recent news obtained here, although battles are very fierce in front of the Finnish Mannerheim Line, the main front line remains intact. It is also reported that the number of Swedes volunteering to join the Finnish army has reached a thousand, and many have crossed the border into Finnish territory. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Helsinki. A Reuters special correspondent learned that Finland has only used reserve troops to resist the Soviet army so far. The elite Finnish troops are stationed behind the front line, ready to move to any location where the defense is weak. Due to a slight lack of ammunition, the Finnish army is sufficient to repel the Soviet army's attacks, but cannot engage in long-range counter-bombardment with the Soviet army. They only shoot when they are confident of hitting the target. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Moscow. The Leningrad Military District issued the following war report yesterday: "On December 11, Soviet troops continued to make progress on all fronts, occupying the town of Pitkyaranta on the north shore of Lake Ladoga (the terminus of the railway to Sortavala) and the villages of Silpola and Murila in the Viipuri area. The air force was inactive due to heavy low clouds." (TASS, 12th)</p>
<h3>Finland Releases White Paper, Announces Contents of Negotiations</h3>
<p>Helsinki. Finland today released a white paper, disclosing for the first time the complete Soviet demands and Finnish counter-proposals, totaling thirteen documents. The demands made by the Soviet Union include: (1) Leasing the Hanko Peninsula for thirty years to establish a naval base, whose batteries, together with the batteries of the Estonian port of Paldiski, could effectively block the Gulf of Finland; (2) The right to station troops on the Hanko Peninsula; (3) Finland's cession of Hogland and other islands, as well as land on the Karelian Isthmus. The Soviet Union would provide twice the amount of territory in exchange; (4) Strengthening the Soviet-Finnish non-aggression pact and not joining any alliance hostile to the other party; (5) Mutual cancellation of the defenses of the Åland Islands, provided that no other major power participates. Finland was prepared to accept most of the above conditions, but stated that it was impossible to agree to the Soviet Union establishing a naval base on the Hanko Peninsula. The Soviet side insisted that the Hanko Peninsula was the minimum defense for Leningrad, but was willing to reduce the number of troops stationed on the island. Finland declared its determination to maintain its territorial integrity, and stated that the land proposed by the Soviet Union for exchange was not of equal value to what it demanded, and that Finland was unwilling to allow foreign countries to establish military bases on its territory. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov replied that this debate was groundless. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>Only Outpost Contacts on Western Front, British Army Commander Encourages Soldiers to Maintain Traditional Glory</h3>
<p>Paris. The French High Command announced last night that the Western Front was experiencing heavy rain and bad weather, making operations very difficult, so there was little activity. However, there was still fierce fighting southwest of Saarbrücken between the French and German sides. Small detachments of the French army, from ten to fifty men, attacked the outer edges of the German lines in the hope of capturing one or two prisoners and obtaining information.

Our allies have warmly welcomed you, and from now on we will fight shoulder to shoulder, and we and our allies can have closer contact. Since our arrival in France, everyone has done their duty," to achieve this special honor. The enemy has been waiting for our arrival at the front line for a long time. You must take this opportunity to maintain the traditional glory of our army and carry it forward. You must be diligent, calm, and adaptable, and fight to the end, so as not to disappoint the expectations of our country, our allies, and all the people of the British Empire. Our cause is just.

<p>Paris. Since the outbreak of the European war, the French army has been actively improving the fortifications of the Maginot Line. The front of the line is densely covered with barbed wire, which, if connected, could form an obstacle four meters wide and four thousand kilometers long. As for the engineering costs of digging trenches, if they were used to dig canals in peacetime, a canal 200 kilometers long could be created. The steel and concrete used to build bunkers, forts, and shelters could build a wall one meter high and 700 kilometers long. This great project was completed by mobilizing a million soldiers for three months. In terms of the materials used, 16,500,000 square meters of barbed wire were used, weighing 65,000 tons, and 700,000 cubic meters of steel and concrete, and 4,500,000 cubic meters of soil were excavated.

<h3>United States Adopts Cautious Attitude Towards Soviet Union, Deeply Fears Impact on Far East Situation, Hoover Leads Aid to Finland Movement</h3>
<p>Washington. The United States Department of State is currently taking an unusually silent attitude toward the Soviet-Finnish conflict. Political figures are paying close attention to this matter, pointing out that the United States clearly sympathizes with Britain and France, and that Finland's $10 million loan is not for military purposes, but to purchase food and other goods from the United States. According to officials in the Department of the Army, Finland's plan to purchase military aircraft and arms from the United States has failed, because the arms factories replied that they had too many outstanding orders and could not sign new contracts. In fact, it is believed that this was at the behest of the Department of the Army. The reason why the United States adopted this attitude towards Finland is clearly because it does not want to worsen US-Soviet relations. Political figures in Washington believe that if the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union deteriorates, the United States' position in China will inevitably weaken. Washington political figures generally believe that after Britain's political withdrawal, the United States is the only representative of capitalist countries in the Far East to deal with Japan. Therefore, in order to maintain its huge interests in the Far East, it is unwilling to adopt a clear anti-Soviet policy. (Haitong, 12th)</p>

<p>New York. Former Republican President Hoover recently issued a statement advocating that December 17 be designated as "Finland Day," with people from all walks of life donating to relieve civilians in Finland. In addition, various newspapers commented on the Finnish issue, saying that countries may not impose collective sanctions on the Soviet Union, but may individually assist Finland. The Democratic New York Times stated that we should provide material assistance to Finland and allow it to purchase artillery and aircraft in the United States. The Republican New York Herald Tribune stated, "The League of Nations' actions this time are extremely swift and are carried out in a unanimous spirit. Since the establishment of the League of Nations, this is the first time. Whether it will be effective remains to be proven by facts. In short, Geneva has now discovered a new international atmosphere, dealing with limited problems with limited functions. Its future development has various possibilities. It is truly worth paying attention to." (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Weakness Displayed in Modern Warfare, Backwardness of Arms Industry Technology, Reliance on United States for Many Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Washington. According to a report released today by Hu Dongyuan, a researcher at the China Economic Research Association, Japan's arms production is insufficient, so it has greatly increased its purchases of steel industry machinery in the United States. This steel industry machinery now ranks third among Japan's major imports, which are also inputs for military supplies. In other words, the first is kerosene and its by-products, and the second is scrap iron and scrap steel. According to Hu, Japan is trying its best to purchase this steel industry production machinery, which clearly shows that Japan is not only a country lacking raw materials, but also a country with the most backward technology and productivity among the leading countries in the modern world. Due to the backwardness of Japan's industrial technology status, Japan's arms production cannot be expanded, and at the same time, it affects its ability to engage in modern warfare. In order to overcome this weakness, Japan has been doing its best to develop its heavy industry in recent years. In Japan's efforts to develop its heavy industry and arms industry, American machinery is the most important. In addition, in recent years, the United States' exports to Japan have mostly been military raw materials, and the goods used in peacetime have become increasingly scarce. For example, in the first eight months of 1937, military supplies accounted for 53 percent of US goods exported to Japan, increasing to 64 percent in 1938, and to 71 percent in the first eight months of 1939. The main items were kerosene and oils, iron, scrap steel, industrial production machinery, copper, automobiles and their parts, iron blocks, aircraft and their parts, and other steel items.

<h3>Amount of Japanese Banknotes Issued Exceeds 5 Billion, Military Notes Not Included</h3>
<p>Tokyo. After careful investigation, "Asahi Shimbun" stated today that the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan and other banknotes linked to the Japanese yen in East Asia totaled 4,044,000,000 yen as of the end of November, compared to 2,946,000,000 yen in the same month in 1938. It is estimated that the total number of banknotes issued by various banks at the end of October this year, the Bank of Japan reached 3,650,000,000 yen, the Bank of Korea 420,000,000 yen, the Bank of Taiwan 170,000,000 yen, the Central Bank of "Manchukuo" 670,000,000 yen, the North China United Reserve Bank 367,000,000 yen, and the Inner Mongolia Bank 54,000,000 yen, totaling 5,331,000,000 yen. The military notes issued in various parts of China are not included. All of these banknotes are backed by the Bank of Japan's gold reserves. The above total is an increase of 1,370,000,000 yen compared to December 1938, and an increase of 2,198,000,000 yen compared to December 1937. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Dissatisfaction with Cabinet: Difficult Road Ahead for Resolving the China Incident</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Regarding the resolution of the China Incident and domestic policies, the Japanese Army, which has always actively supported the Abe Cabinet, is now showing concern and a slight level of dissatisfaction towards the Cabinet's attitude of avoiding the establishment of a Ministry of Trade and the abolition of the order guaranteeing the status of civil servants, thereby increasing the difficulties for the Japanese government. According to the independent newspaper "Miyako Shimbun," the Army fears that the Cabinet is showing "increasingly insufficient ability" to resolve various crucial domestic problems and the China Incident, as well as to adjust complex disputes with third countries. Therefore, it is expected that Minister of the Army Shunroku Hata will likely "engage in strong negotiations with the Cabinet" and urge a more proactive attitude in implementing the policies pursued by the Cabinet.

<h3>Third Round of US-Japan Talks Imminent: Grew Receives Instructions</h3>
<p>Washington – After carefully reviewing the Japanese proposals for US-Japan negotiations, the US State Department appears to have instructed Ambassador Grew in Japan that a third meeting between Nomura and Grew will be held soon. As for the content of the second meeting on the 4th of this month, the State Department believes that the Japanese side has shown sincerity in its willingness to adjust US-Japan relations, which the US fully acknowledges. While the Japanese side has indicated its willingness to compensate for damages to American property in China, the US is most concerned about Japan's future guarantee of American rights and interests in China, a point on which the Japanese side has made no promises. This is a matter of deep concern for the US. However, it is still hoped that the talks will continue so that the positions of both sides can gradually converge. (Domei News Agency, 11th)</p>

<p>The Hague – The Japanese cargo ship "Sanyo Maru" (8,000 tons), carrying a shipment of German goods, was originally scheduled to set sail from Rotterdam on the 9th of this month, passing through the naval blockade of Britain and France to return to its home country. However, it received a telegram from Tokyo postponing its departure. According to well-informed sources here, British and Japanese authorities are negotiating the issue of blockading German exports. The "Sanyo Maru" must wait until the negotiations are concluded before setting sail. Rumors that Japanese authorities intend to use this ship to attempt to break through the blockade line of Britain and France are inaccurate. The cargo on the ship was purchased by importers from neutral countries on October 27, before Britain and France announced the blockade of German exports. Therefore, it is not subject to detention. It is evident that the ship can pass through the blockade line of Britain and France at any time before January 1 of next year, the deadline set by Britain and France, without causing any disputes. Therefore, what remains to be resolved in the negotiations between British and Japanese authorities are some crucial details. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris – The Spanish Ambassador to France, Lequerica, recently sent a note to the French Foreign Ministry, declaring a reservation of all rights regarding the British and French blockade of German exports. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>Authorities Begin Thorough Investigation of Grain Hoarding in Warehouses: Special Branch of the Police Department Has Begun Operations: Flat-Price Sale of Foreign Rice Likely to Proceed Early: Japanese Side Claims Cooperation with Both Concessions to Control Rice Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council issued announcements on the 10th, banning the hoarding of rice and grain and raising market prices within the concessions. If anyone violates the aforementioned behavior, the authorities will not provide protection, or even expel them, and confiscate their stockpiles. Yesterday, it was learned that the Public Concession Police Department has handed over the investigation and enforcement of this matter to the Special Branch. However, it has been decided to avoid all public publicity. A senior official of the Police Department stated yesterday that the Police Department is determined to strictly and calmly implement this new duty to alleviate the food shortage of the Chinese people within the concession. The decision not to publicize is not to be construed as a relaxation of duties. As for speculation that investigators and rice merchants will become more involved in matters, this is unfounded. Those who are criticized in the announcement are only unscrupulous merchants who hoard, and it has nothing to do with legitimate rice merchants. Hoarders are not necessarily all rice merchants. There are manipulators here who are not only not rice merchants, but not even merchants, yet they hoard rice for profit, causing rice prices to skyrocket. All such people are on the radar of the Police Department investigators. The Police Department's actions this time will not be to adopt high-handed tactics, and only those who are stubborn and refuse to comply with the warnings of the authorities of the two concessions will be subject to warnings. Therefore, the Police Department has decided not to publicize too much in order to avoid unnecessary difficulties, but to seek truth from facts in order to achieve the goal of suppressing rice prices. All sectors of society, for the sake of public interest, should report to the police authorities of the French Concession and the Public Concession if they are aware of any hoarding, speculation, or monopoly of rice and grain, so that they can be prosecuted and assisted in the investigation. This is what is hoped for.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Claims Assistance to Authorities</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that an official of the Municipal Council told reporters yesterday (the 11th) that after the announcement warning rice speculators and hoarders was published, there had been no developments, and no one had reported illegal profiteers to the Municipal Council in accordance with the regulations of the announcement. Therefore, the authorities have not taken any action against rice merchants such as expelling them from the two concessions or confiscating their rice stockpiles. There are some obstacles to the import of rice into the city, but rice is still being transported from occupied areas and Saigon. It is too early to predict what will happen in the future and can only wait and see. According to a Japanese Army spokesperson yesterday, the Japanese Army authorities will fully cooperate with the efforts of the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession to control rice prices. The Japanese Army authorities will take action to increase the amount of rice imported into Shanghai and help resolve the situation.</p>
<p>Secret Surveillance of Warehouses Within the Concession</p>
<p>The concession authorities believe that the high rice prices have a major impact on the security of the city. Therefore, in addition to jointly issuing an announcement by the two concessions to stop hoarding, speculation, and monopolization of rice and grain, the Food and Fuel Supply Committee of the Municipal Council has had significant developments after days of consultations, taking decisive measures against those who manipulate food for profit. It is heard that they have now begun investigating the rice, flour, soybean oil, and other goods hoarded in various warehouses, and have secretly dispatched police to monitor several warehouses that are manipulating rice prices for profit. Once evidence is obtained, they will be punished. It is heard that many citizens have reported unscrupulous merchants to the authorities in recent days, which is very helpful to the authorities in punishing unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>Large Households Sell Off, Market Trends Stabilize</p>
<p>A reporter from the Datong News Agency yesterday asked a leader in the rice industry about the impact of the joint announcement by the two concessions to punish rice prices on hoarders and manipulators. According to him, the most effective aspect of the joint announcement by the two concessions is that it can cause large households to sell off one after another. The reason why Shanghai rice prices have reached unprecedented highs is that large households have absorbed the rice and grain transported to Shanghai and stored it in warehouses, waiting for a good price to sell, resulting in rising rice prices. Since the announcement by the two concessions, large rice-hoarding households, under the watchful eyes of the public, are deeply afraid of being severely punished and have no choice but to sell off as soon as possible. This allows the rice and grain transported to Shanghai to be fully supplied to the market for open buying and selling, without being manipulated by profiteers, and without being hoarded for higher prices.</p>
<p>Consultations on Early Flat-Price Sales and Application for Legal Foreign Exchange to Order Foreign Rice for Flat-Price Sales: The Most Effective Way to Suppress Rice Prices. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Yu Qiaqing stated that he intends to consult with the financial community within two or three days to actively carry out this matter. According to the opinion of Zhang Nianxuan, Chairman of the Rice Guild, the quality of the rice for this flat-price sale should be lower than the previous one, because rice of very good quality is more expensive, which is contrary to the purpose of helping the common people. The method of selling flat-price rice should be changed to be sold by each rice shop, which can allow the common people to buy locally and avoid crowding.</p>
<p>Reasons for Rice and Grain Not Being Able to Be Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, the reasons why the rice-producing areas of the Sūcháng area of Jiangsu Province cannot transport rice to Shanghai are as follows: (1) There are more than one million Japanese troops in the occupied areas, and the amount of rice and grain they need each month is quite alarming and must be supplied in large quantities. (2) Rice grains have been continuously transported from Central China to Japan this year, affecting the source and making it impossible to transport large quantities to Shanghai. On the 1st of this month, another 400,000 bags of rice grains were transported to Osaka, Japan by ship. It is said that the rice was procured by the Japanese military. The above two points are the key to the lack of increase in the source of rice and grain.</p>
<p>Integrity and Shame Movement Issues Loyalty Announcement</p>
<p>The Integrity and Shame Movement initiated by all sectors of the city is now in its second day. In addition to distributing declarations to schools, groups, shops, factories, and residential areas, continuing to explain the meaning of the Integrity and Shame Movement, and promoting various corrective actions, it is particularly concerned about the fact that unscrupulous merchants in the city are hoarding rice, causing rice prices to rise, which greatly affects people's food and social security. It has issued a loyalty announcement to hoarders and rice merchants, urging them to lower rice prices in order to maintain people's food supply.</p>
<h3>New Kaihe Iron Gate Open for the Second Day: Great Crowd of People Entering and Exiting: People Flock to Visit: Separate Entry and Exit, Good Order</h3>
<p>After the opening of the New Kaihe Iron Gate, yesterday was the second day. Among the residents of the Nanshi district entering and exiting, there were those who had been away from their hometowns for two years since the war. Some residents were previously limited by permits and could not enter. Now that the French Concession authorities have opened it up, they are all flocking to it. Therefore, the number of people entering and exiting Nanshi in the past two days has been very crowded. The number of French Concession tram passengers going to the 16th Pier has increased several times. It is heard that the opening has resulted in relatively good order.</p>
<p>Separate Entry and Exit</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter who visited the New Kaihe Iron Gate yesterday morning, residents entering Nanshi from the concession or entering the concession from Nanshi were in an endless stream. In order to relieve the congestion, the French Police Department opened the small doors on both sides of the iron gate at the same time, in addition to closing the central iron gate. Those entering the concession from Nanshi must enter from the small door on the north side, and those entering Nanshi from the concession must exit from the small door on the south side.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection</p>
<p>Although the French Concession does not require permits for residents entering and exiting the iron gate, the Japanese soldiers and "Dad Road Police" standing outside the Minguo Road iron gate must have a "Nanshi Resident Permit" to be allowed to pass, and the inspection is very strict. The above-mentioned permit is printed with the words "Shanghai Special Service Agency Nanshi Branch" and the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government Nanshi District Office." At the same time, residents holding a "Pudong Resident Permit" can also enter and exit, while those holding a "Hongkou Resident Permit" are standing near the iron gate. It seems that these people are worried about whether the Hongkou "Permit" is also valid here, so they dare not try it lightly, fearing that once they are inside, they will not be able to return to the concession.</p>
<p>Good Order</p>
<p>Regarding the traffic of military vehicles, in the one hour that the Datong News Agency reporter silently observed, none were seen. Because the central iron gate is closed, and only the small doors on both sides are used, it seems difficult for vehicles to pass. It is likely that the central iron gate will be opened temporarily. There are many detectives stationed at the entrance of the small door on the north side by the French Police Department, so the order is very good. The Datong News Agency reporter then went to the Laobeimen and Nanyang Bridge iron gates to inspect, and they were still closed. It has been said that the Nanyang Bridge iron gate would be opened yesterday, but it has been proven that this is not true. According to reliable news obtained by the Xinsheng News Agency, the Xinbeimen iron gate will be opened first. The authorities have also stipulated that the New Kaihe Iron Gate will be used as an exit, and the Xinbeimen iron gate will be changed to an entrance in order to avoid affecting order. As for the sampans selling ferries on the Huangpu River, no one is taking care of them.</p>
<p>Vehicle Permit</p>
<p>The Wenshihai Daily reported on the 11th that in the past, anyone taking the New Kaihe Iron Gate from Nanshi to enter the French Concession was required to have a permit from the French Concession. It is now heard that this permit has been temporarily cancelled from December 11th. However, it is heard that the entry and exit of trucks through the New Kaihe Iron Gate is still handled as usual.</p>

<h3>Puppet Tax Bureau Promotes "Stamp Duty": Foreign Merchants Firmly Oppose: Establishes "Inspection Office at Customs" to Inspect Goods: Forces Goods Tax Payment Certificates to Affix Fake Stamps: Import and Export Firms Unanimously Refuse</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai fell, the Jianghai Customs has been forced to change hands, taxes are collected in "Huaxing Coupons," and the tax collectors of the Central Bank have been forced to withdraw, with customs revenue being intercepted by Japan and stored in the Yokohama Specie Bank. Now, the "Sūzhèwǎn Tax Administration" has established an "Inspection Office at Customs" to promote its fake "Stamp Duty." Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Puppet Bureau Establishes Inspection Office at Customs</p>
<p>After the tax collection office of the Central Bank in the Jianghai Customs Building was illegally taken over by personnel from the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank, the tax collectors of the Central Bank have all withdrawn. All customs revenue of the Jianghai Customs is handled by personnel from the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank. Now, the "Sūzhèwǎn Tax Administration" has established an inspection office at the tax collection office yesterday to carry out its so-called inspection of various consolidated tax goods for import and export, and to promote the "Reformed Government's" "Stamp Duty Stamps." It is heard that the inspection will be implemented from the 13th of this month, and personnel will begin working at the same time.</p>
<p>Attempt to Promote Fake "Stamp Duty"</p>
<p>The announcement of the "Sūzhèwǎn Tax Administration" states that "in order to make an announcement, the former Sūzhèwǎn Consolidated Tax Bureau had an office established at the customs, which was temporarily suspended due to the incident. Now, "this bureau" has agreed with the Jianghai Customs authorities to re-establish the "Inspection Office at Customs" in order to supervise various consolidated tax goods for import and export. The office will begin working on the 13th of this month. After that, all holders of the Customs Import Tax Payment Certificate and the Customs Export and Transit Tax Payment Certificate must purchase a two-fen stamp for each certificate from the "Inspection Office" and affix it to the certificate as proof for inspection."</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Firmly Oppose Affixing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter learned from relevant sources that after the Sūzhèwǎn Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to withdraw, the affixing of stamps to the Customs Import and Export and Transit Tax Payment Certificates was temporarily suspended, and each import and export merchant affixed their own stamps. The establishment of the "Inspection Office" by the puppet "Sūzhèwǎn Tax Bureau," although stipulating that each stamp is two fen, which is less than the previous four fen per stamp, is aimed at promoting its so-called "Reformed Stamps." After the issuance of the "Reformed Stamps," all sectors have uniformly refused them, resulting in no results to speak of. The foreign merchants in this port have expressed their firm opposition to this matter.</p>
<h3>Sincere Company Strike Resolved: Negotiations Settled Yesterday; Management Promises a Concrete Response by the 20th; All Branches to Resume Business This Morning</h3>
<p>Over 700 junior and mid-level employees of the Nanjing Road Sincere Company's main and branch stores went on strike two days ago due to their proposed requests for improved treatment not being adopted by the authorities. During this peak winter sales season, the company suffered significant losses, and the employees themselves were also under considerable mental distress. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department dispatched Gu Bingyuan and Gao Yangen to once again negotiate a settlement with the company's management. At 8:00 PM, they reconvened with employee representatives Shen Zhilan, Wang Wei, Zhu Gongliang, Wu Mingquan, Wan Chunsheng, and Bao Beihong for tripartite discussions. A joint resolution was reached regarding the four demands put forth by the employees: (1) The request to reinstate three days of supplementary work will now be converted into a subsidy fee. If other companies increase supplementary work hours in the future, this practice will be followed. (2) A uniform subsidy of five yuan can be granted, but the exact amount must await instructions from the Hong Kong headquarters. (3) The year-end distribution of dividends will also be subject to instructions from the Hong Kong headquarters. (4) Regarding job security, the company does not offer absolute guarantees. A consensus was reached in the tripartite talks to provide a concrete response no later than the 20th of this month. With this, the strike at the company was fully resolved, and all branches resumed operations this morning. According to a company representative who spoke to a Datong News Agency reporter last night, the company is grateful for the condolences and gifts of various items from all sectors of society during the strike. They will strive to live up to public expectations.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Bureau Employees Demand Pay Raise</h3>
<p>Messengers at the Great Northern Telegraph Company (Danish), the Great Eastern Telegraph Company (British), and the Pacific Telegraph Company (American), located on Edward Road, jointly submitted a petition to the three companies yesterday. They pointed out that since the three companies withdrew from the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the International Wireless Radio Station, business has increased severalfold, and the companies have all made profits. Furthermore, prices are rising daily, making life difficult. Therefore, they requested that the three companies consider increasing salaries and providing rice subsidies. It is reported that the company authorities will provide a satisfactory response to all messenger requests within a few days.</p>
<h3>Fake Police Cross Border, Intercepted by Police; Mistakenly Enter Robison Road; Depart After Persuasion</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, a team of police officers from the Dadao (Greater Shanghai Municipality) Police First Unit mistakenly went down Robison Road yesterday (the 11th) morning and were intercepted by police officers from the Public Concession. Onlookers expected a conflict to arise, but no dispute occurred. Subsequently, patrols from the U.S. Marine Corps repeatedly patrolled the area to guide any other errant Dadao police officers. Initially, the armed Dadao police team was not stopped at the large iron gate on the Public Concession border, a quarter of a mile west of Jessfield Road. They were only stopped and dissuaded by police officers stationed near the post after proceeding down Robison Road. The Dadao police officers left several minutes later. Because Robison Road is within their defense zone, the U.S. Marine Corps sent troops to assist the police, repeatedly patrolling in front of the iron gate on Robison Road. No incidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Rumor: Fake Court to Prosecute Two Chinese Detectives; "Crimes" Allegedly to Be Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, the Japanese-run *New Shenbao* reported today (the 12th) that the "prosecutor" of the "Shanghai West Branch of the Local Court," under Japanese protection, has prepared indictments against two Chinese detectives from the Public Concession who were arrested by Japanese soldiers. The full text will be announced tomorrow. However, the specific crimes of which the two detectives are accused have not been disclosed. (Note: The two Chinese detectives are numbers 1210 and 1650.) They were detained by the Japanese on Robison Road on the 19th of last month, along with Western detective Eagar and a female inspector. However, Eagar and the female inspector were released after being detained for five hours.</p>
<h3>Sale of "Military Currency" on Suzhou Creek Apparently Directed Behind the Scenes; Conducted by Those with Financial Resources; Increased Activity Recently, Deserving Attention</h3>
<p>According to the *North-China Daily News*, since the Japanese forcibly implemented the use of military currency in the occupied areas of Central China, those exchanging military currency on the bridges over Suzhou Creek have become increasingly active. There are clearly individuals directing this behind the scenes, but reporters have been unable to identify them. It is reported that both Chinese and Japanese individuals associated with the new political regime are closely monitoring the exchange of military currency. A reporter who visited the North Sichuan Road Bridge yesterday observed that these exchangers were</p>
<p>Conducting Frequent Transactions</p>
<p>Using legal tender to exchange, with a premium ranging from 25 to 40 cents. These individuals stood at the head of the bridge, like ticket collectors, asking those crossing into the interior if they had military currency. This is because trains, buses, and Japanese stores in the occupied areas only accept military currency. The exchange rate is 1.32 yuan in legal tender for one yuan of Japanese military currency. In essence, Chinese people holding legal tender and entering the occupied interior will</p>
<p>Suffer Losses</p>
<p>However, these military currency exchangers can hardly be described as illegal profiteers, as they are like other small vendors, earning a meager profit to make a living. According to investigations, these exchangers earn 5 to 7 cents per yuan exchanged, depending on the size of the transaction. If someone exchanges several yuan of military currency, the exchange rate may be 1.40 yuan in legal tender. If the amount exchanged is large, the exchange rate may decrease to 1.30 yuan in legal tender. Exchange shops on Sichuan Road do not exchange small amounts of military currency, only conducting</p>
<p>Large Transactions</p>
<p>For example, exchanging 1,000 yuan of military currency requires over 1,200 yuan in legal tender. There are approximately 50 individuals exchanging military currency on the bridge. These individuals admit that there are individuals with greater financial resources directing them behind the scenes, but they are unwilling to reveal the names of these individuals. They have been engaged in this small-scale business for several months, but have become more active recently because the Japanese are forcing the circulation of military currency in the occupied areas, requiring travelers to use this type of paper money to purchase train tickets, etc. These individuals also exchange smaller denominations of military currency and warn travelers not to use military currency in areas controlled by guerrillas.</p>
<h3>Returned Overseas Chinese Unable to Find Work; Travel Back to Native Place Together by Ship</h3>
<p>A total of over 300 Zhejiang natives, who were overseas Chinese returning home after losing their jobs due to the impact of the European war, have arrived in Shanghai in succession. A portion of them had already left for Ningbo in batches by ship last month, to return to their hometowns. It is now learned that over eighty of them originally planned to find employment in Shanghai, but after a month of trying various methods, they were unable to obtain any suitable jobs. Furthermore, most of them were staying in hotels, incurring significant daily expenses. Therefore, they boarded the *Haifu* and *Haida* ships together the day before yesterday to go to Ningbo, and then return to their hometowns in Wenzhou and Qingtian.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Budget Deficit; Studying Ways to Make Up; Tax Increase Inevitable but Not Yet Determined; Details of Loans Can Only Be Announced at Year-End</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, Stirling Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told reporters this morning (the 12th) that as a result of the Public Works Department's estimated deficit of over six million yuan this year, an increase in taxes in the Public Concession would soon be necessary. Fessenden stated that he was referring to the Public Works Department's treasurer's report, which contained everything. The full report on the Public Works Department's financial situation for this year was being published at this time</p>
<p>To Inform the Public of the Situation. The Public Works Department's Finance Committee would soon prepare the financial report and budget for the next year and would attempt to obtain assistance from the treasurer to resolve the difficulties. A significant deficit would inevitably lead to an increase in taxes within the Public Concession, but this was something the Finance Committee would study. It would be wrong for him to predict the committee's decisions. The reporter pointed out that the detailed report on the Public Works Department's</p>
<p>Debt Report</p>
<p>Was not included in this year's budget financial report. Fessenden claimed that he had nothing to say about the Public Works Department's loans. The Public Works Department considered loans to be "fixed" debt and therefore had not published detailed reports on loans. The details of the Bureau's loans would only be announced at the end of the year. Fessenden then reiterated his belief that as a result of this year's significant deficit, the</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Was only to increase taxes, but this matter would be decided by the Finance Committee after the treasurer of the Public Works Department made recommendations. The item regarding "Eastern District Revival" in the budget financial report did not refer to the Public Works Department's recent sale of its buildings and properties in the northern part of the Public Concession, but only referred to residents returning to the area to rebuild houses and residences.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Ma Xiangbo Postponed; Preparatory Committee Resolved Yesterday; Postponed Until Saturday Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for Ma Xiangbo has been actively carrying out memorial activities since its establishment on the 8th of last month. The memorial service was originally scheduled to be held on the 29th of this month, but due to the complexity of the affairs, it was feared that it would not be possible to hold it on that day. In order to redetermine the date of the memorial service and the method of carrying it out, the committee held a joint meeting of all groups at the Banking Club at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 40 representatives from each group attended and elected Li Wenjie as chairman. First, Mr. Li reported on the establishment of the committee, the committee's rules and regulations, organizational system, and the names of the members of each group. Then, the meeting began. It was resolved that: (1) The memorial service would not be held on December 29th and would be postponed until the next month, with a date to be determined among the three Saturdays. The venue would be contacted immediately. (2) To raise funds for the memorial service, letters would first be sent to various agencies and organizations inviting them to participate, with donations to be made by each agency and organization. Any shortfall would be raised by the preparatory committee members themselves, but limited to 10 yuan. (3) The budget for the assembly would be determined after the funds had been raised, with economy as the guiding principle. (4) The layout of the venue, memorial service program, etc., would be decided separately. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Vietnam Government Requisitioning Vehicles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Kunming joint transportation operated by the local Sino-French Express Company used to transit through Saigon, Annam. Due to the recent expansion of its business, a new route was opened via Tourane, and an office was set up to accept passengers and goods in Shanghai, which would then be transported to Kunming via Tourane. However, the company recently received a telegram from Saigon stating that all transportation vehicles in Tourane had been requisitioned by the Vietnamese government and that no passenger vehicles could pass through. Therefore, this newly opened route cannot be opened in the near future. All passengers and goods transported from Shanghai to Kunming can only transit through Saigon, so passenger and cargo bookings for the French mail ship *Dumont d'Urville*, which is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 15th of this month, have become even more crowded.</p>
<h3>Chairperson of the Professional Women's Club, Mao Liying, Shot Yesterday; Shot by Assailant on Nanjing Road Near Sichuan Road Last Night; Three Bullets Hit; One in the Abdomen, Condition Critical</h3>
<p>Near No. 120 Alley near the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, at around 7:00 PM yesterday, a woman was seen walking out of the alley. The woman was wearing leather shoes and fashionable clothes. As she walked out of the alley and prepared to walk west, a young man in a suit suddenly jumped out of hiding, quickly caught up with her, and walked ahead of her. Unexpectedly, after walking only a few steps, the young man suddenly turned around,</p>
<p>Revealing a Fierce Expression,</p>
<p>Blocking her path. The woman was caught off guard and screamed in alarm. At that moment, the young man took out a pistol from his coat and fired three shots at her, then fled. Nearby police officers heard the alarm and reported it to the police station, which dispatched detectives to search for him. However, the young assailant was already gone. Detective No. 12 rushed the wounded woman to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the hospital's doctor, it was discovered that a bullet had struck the woman's abdomen, but had not passed through. One bullet had struck her leg, and another her foot. Due to significant blood loss, her</p>
<p>Condition is Extremely Critical.</p>
<p>As for her name, it is said to be Mao Liying, age 28, from Ningbo. She currently resides in the Qixiu Girls' School on Avenue Joffre and serves as the chairperson of the Professional Women's Club in the city. The motives behind the attack are difficult to speculate. The police are taking this matter very seriously and are actively investigating. According to an investigation conducted by this newspaper's reporter after the incident, it was learned that the victim had previously worked at the Customs and taught at a school. Because she is still unmarried and frugal, her</p>
<p>Personal Life</p>
<p>Is Quite Comfortable. She usually does not frequent social events, but is committed to promoting women's careers. The charity sale recently held by the Professional Women's Club was promoted by Mao and others. Unfortunately, it was disrupted by villains at the time, but with the help of the police, it was finally completed. Later, a certain publication once falsely accused her of being a communist, but Mao ignored it. She usually does not participate in political activities. This unfortunate incident is very puzzling.</p>
<h3>Wave of Strikes in Northern District Factories</h3>
<p>The wave of strikes by workers in factories in the area north of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession, demanding pay raises, is raging. The Xiangmao Soap Factory, located at No. 2310 Yangshupu Road, began its strike on the 11th, which has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, four more factories also experienced strike waves: the Mifeng Woolen Mill (British) at No. 400 Poyang Road, the China Paper Products Company (American) at No. 273 Haizhou Road, and the "Chinese Workers Welfare Association" of Yangshupu. Their activities have intensified in recent days.</p>
<p>According to the *North-China Daily News*, 700 Chinese employees of the British-owned China Soap Company's factory on Yangshupu Road went on strike due to the rising prices in the city and demands for increased wages. They did not enter the factory for work yesterday (the 11th) morning at 7:00 AM, causing the factory to be closed all day yesterday.</p>
<h3>Former Polish Consul General to China Killed in Bombing; Dr. Kretzschmar Injured During Siege of Warsaw</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, Dr. Kretzschmar, who lived in China for 15 years, served as a counselor at the Polish Embassy and the Polish Consul General, died in Warsaw during the siege of the city. The city has not yet received definite details of his death, but one report said that Dr. Kretzschmar was injured and died when a shell exploded. The fate of his wife and daughter is unknown, but it is said that they left Warsaw before the outbreak of war. Dr. Kretzschmar was well-known in Shanghai. In addition to his regular duties, he also taught law at Aurora University and handled consular affairs very competently, which was highly regarded by the foreign community. In his youth, Dr. Kretzschmar studied at the University of Paris and the University of Fribourg. After entering the School of Oriental Languages, he became fluent in both Chinese and Japanese. He was recalled from Shanghai to Poland on November 2, 1938.</p>

<h3>Car on Hart Road Refuses Arrest and Flees Last Night; Detectives Ordered to Stop for Search; Occupants Open Fire and Speed Away; Stray Bullet from Five Shots Injures Passerby</h3>
<p>Before 7:00 PM yesterday evening, the Jing'an Temple Police Station in charge of Hart Road near Edinburgh Road dispatched patrol detectives to conduct inspections in the nearby area. At around 7:15 PM, patrol detectives noticed a large black sedan speeding eastward. The detectives signaled for it to stop for a search. Unexpectedly, the driver of the car, upon seeing the detectives' signals, immediately turned off all the car's headlights, not only failing to slow down but also doubling its speed, rushing past the detectives' post. The occupants of the car then fired five shots at the detectives from the car. Fortunately, the detectives were scattered in different positions, so they were not hit. They also drew their guns and fired back at the car, but because the car was traveling so fast, they were unable to catch up with it and it escaped. They reported the details to the police station for investigation. At the time, a fishmonger from Shaoxing named Jin Yongquan, age 60, happened to be passing by and was injured in the leg by a stray bullet fired by the occupants of the car. He has been taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment by police car. The whereabouts of the car and its owner are currently under close investigation.</p>

At around 7:00 PM last night, Zhang suddenly lost his mind and was no longer in control of himself. He jumped from the fifth floor of the New Building on Yinghua Street, falling onto Hubei Road. His skull was fractured and he died instantly. People then called for an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital, and then to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Hardware Broker Embezzles Gambling Debts; Case Settled and Light Sentence Given</h3>
<p>Yuan Huoying from Ningbo, who worked as a broker for the Japanese hardware trading company Longfu Hardware and Machinery at Room 304, No. 86 Guangdong Road, had a good reputation on weekdays. However, from June to July of this year, he went to various gambling dens in Shanghai West and gambled wildly, accumulating heavy debts. He then embezzled 13,380 yuan in payment for goods ordered by four Chinese firms, Huiyuanxiang, Yukang, Tongren, and Yuanchang, and secretly fled. The company's manager, Hiramoto Fukukatsu, reported this to the General Police Station, which issued a warrant for his arrest with a reward. Yuan suddenly surrendered to the police station a few days ago. After investigation by Chinese Detective Kang Zengxiang, he was detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, prosecuted him for occupational embezzlement under criminal law, while the plaintiff indicated that a settlement had been reached and requested leniency. Yuan also pleaded guilty and requested that he be allowed to start anew. Judge Xiao then sentenced Yuan to imprisonment for _ years, with a three-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3>Swindle for Two Shi of Rice; Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Zhao Weizhen from Ningbo, 29 years old, previously an insurance agent, residing at No. 14, Xinyifang, Lane 614, Baishi Road in the Concession, swindled Liu Guang, the owner of the Xinfuzhou Restaurant at No. 618 Lane, out of one dan of top-quality white rice each time on two occasions in the afternoon of the 7th of this month, with each dan priced at 36 yuan. He instructed that the rice be delivered and he would pay. Liu believed him and sent an apprentice to deliver the rice. After Zhao received the rice, he promised to pay the next day. When the next day arrived, Zhao could not be found. Zhao only returned home the day before yesterday, and Liu learned of this and demanded payment for the rice. Zhao prevaricated, and Liu reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Zhao. It was discovered that he had committed a similar fraud before and had been prosecuted. He was taken into custody for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The police station's lawyer, Yuan Jiahong, stated the facts of the case and prosecuted him for fraud. The plaintiff, Liu Guang, also recounted the details of being swindled. When Zhao was questioned, he denied swindling the rice and claimed that the plaintiff had entrusted him to sell it on his behalf. All the white rice had been resold to a friend on Mei Bai Ke Road, but the money for the rice had not yet been collected. Judge Wu Kechou sentenced Zhao Weizhen to six months imprisonment for continuous fraudulent offenses to serve as a warning. He will be detained in the detention center during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Intense Gunfire on Avenue Edward VII: Bandit Captured After Being Shot; Escaped from Robbery at a Restaurant on North Honan Road; Police Shot One Bandit Eleven Times; Bystander Killed by Bullet Piercing Chest</h3>
<p>Yesterday around 6:15 PM, at a certain restaurant located at No. 106 North Honan Road, just as diners were bustling about, two bandits suddenly barged in to commit robbery. One of the bandits, dressed in a blue cloth jacket and black mandarin jacket, wearing black leather shoes, appeared calm and collected, much like a diner. Therefore, bystanders were not on guard. By the time the two bandits stepped inside the cashier's counter and</p>
<p>produced guns to threaten,</p>
<p>it was too late to escape. They were robbed of over thirty yuan in cash and fled towards Avenue Edward VII on Chekiang Road. An employee of the restaurant, unwilling to let them get away, quickly followed closely behind. Upon reaching the intersection of Avenue Edward VII, the employee ran towards traffic police post No. 2359 and reported the crime. Upon hearing the alarm, the officer immediately drew his gun and opened fire on the bandits. Simultaneously, French Concession police officers also</p>
<p>assisted in the encirclement.</p>
<p>Hearing the gunshots, the bandits fled west along Avenue Edward VII, also firing back to resist arrest. They fought and ran, attempting to turn into Rue de la Soeur. However, the police bullets came in a dense barrage. Apart from one bandit who escaped, the bandit dressed in the blue jacket was shot eleven times at the entrance of Rue de la Soeur and collapsed there, captured on the spot. The Public Concession immediately dispatched a vehicle to transport the wounded bandit to the hospital of the Municipal Council for treatment. Meanwhile, they</p>
<p>pursued the accomplice</p>
<p>for further investigation. All seized weapons were also taken to the police station for safekeeping. However, during the fierce battle between the police and the bandits, a passerby named Yin Weijun, having just left a friend's residence at No. 412 Great Shanghai Hotel, happened to be passing through the area and was unable to evade. A stray bullet pierced his heart, killing him at the entrance of Rue de la Soeur. His body has been sent to the coroner's office, and the deceased's family is being sought for identification and funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3>Truck Kills Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Tan Fugen, a local driver for the Xiesheng Transportation Company, residing at No. 12 Youfu Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, was driving a cargo truck, license number F-1213, on Rue Lupan in the French Concession on the morning of the 29th of last month at 8:00 AM, heading south. In front of house number 82, he struck and ran over Yu Yutang, an elderly man from Ningbo in his sixties who was calling out to sell wood shavings. Yu suffered a crushed right foot and died despite medical treatment. The police detained Tan and handed him over to the Second Special Court for interrogation and further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Miao Qingbang continued the hearing at the First Criminal Court. The police prosecutor stated that the investigation was not yet complete and requested a two-week adjournment for further investigation before proceeding with the trial. The court verified the statement and adjourned the hearing to the 21st without questioning, ordering the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Prank by Patrons: Cigarette Butts Hidden in Bedding</h3>
<p>Last night, three patrons visited Han Zhuang at No. 6 Guian Lane, Rue Grolik in the French Concession. For some unknown reason, they suddenly had an argument with the prostitutes and left in displeasure. Before leaving, the three patrons hid their cigarette butts in the bedding on the bed. After the customers left, the maid cleaned the room and discovered smoke coming from the bed. The mistress of Han Zhuang immediately chased after them and caught one of them near Avenue Joffre, handing him over to the police station on Rue Koukuei. After the police chief inquired about the situation, he sent a detective to retrieve the burned bedding from Han Zhuang for further verification.</p>
<h3>Accountant of International Hotel Arrested for Embezzling Large Sum of Money; Falsified Figures and Embezzled Over 40,000 Yuan; Squandered Funds with Bad Friends in Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhifei, a 22-year-old from Songjiang, residing at No. 1 Avenue Foch, joined the accounting department of the International Hotel on Bubbling Well Road four years ago, earning a monthly salary of 65 yuan. He was usually diligent in his work and was deeply trusted by the accounting director, Fang Yinting. However, recently, Zhang</p>
<p>suddenly changed his behavior.</p>
<p>He was listless during the day and often appeared drowsy. After detailed investigation by Fang, it was discovered that Zhang had embezzled as much as 43,000 yuan. Fang then reported to the Sinza Police Station, who dispatched Chinese detective Chen Baozhong and Western detective Batlai to the International Hotel to arrest Zhang Zhifei and detain him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police prosecutor, Jiang Baolian, charged him with embezzlement and presented the case, stating that the International Hotel had dealings with the Four Banks Joint Savings Society downstairs, and that all</p>
<p>deposit procedures</p>
<p>had been handled by the defendant for several years. However, recently, the defendant had become involved with bad companions and indulged in gambling dens in Western Shanghai, resulting in substantial losses and leading to this large-scale embezzlement. The method of embezzlement involved the defendant receiving, for example, 3,671.14 yuan to deposit, but only depositing 671.14 yuan, pocketing the remaining 3,000 yuan. After the bank stamped the deposit book, the defendant would privately add the word "three thousand".</p>
<p>This behavior</p>
<p>continued from August 9th of this year until the 5th of this month, with successive embezzlements. Although the bank provided statements at the end of the month, these were also handled and altered by the defendant, so the scheme had not been discovered for several months. With this large sum of money, the defendant, in addition to renting room No. 620 at the Yangtze Hotel, would go to gambling dens such as the Hollywood and Asia Clubs in Western Shanghai every night, wagering thousands of yuan without hesitation, staying up all night, which resulted in a dazed state during the day. The</p>
<p>bank statement</p>
<p>for November was received the day before yesterday, and the defendant, in a moment of carelessness, failed to alter the total amount, leading to the discovery. A pass for the Asia Club and 87 yuan in cash were presented as evidence. When questioned, the defendant confessed to the embezzlement, claiming that it was due to a moment of confusion and associating with bad friends, resulting in the total loss of the money. Judge Xiao ordered Zhang to be remanded in custody for seven days pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Car Fire: Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, at the intersection of Avenue Messimy and Avenue Foch in the French Concession, a Westerner was driving his own car when the engine suddenly caught fire. Flames erupted, and thick smoke filled the air. The fire was eventually extinguished after the fire brigade arrived.</p>
<p>Korean Trafficking Drugs: Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, two Koreans at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Avenue Montigny refused to be searched by Russian officers patrolling for the French Police. They were taken to the police station. It is said that one of them was found to be carrying drugs.</p>
<p>Thief Caught: Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, a thief broke into a certain pharmacy at No. 231 Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui in the French Concession by digging a hole in the back wall, intending to commit theft. An employee, Mr. Jia, noticed and gave chase, shouting "robber!". A detective of the French police happened to be patrolling nearby and rushed to the scene upon hearing the shouts, immediately opening fire and pursuing the thief. Three shots were fired, one of which struck the thief's left foot, the bullet passing through. He fell to the ground in pain and was captured. He identified himself as Xu Asi, from Jiangbei, 30 years old, and confessed to the attempted theft.</p>
<p>Stray Bullet Injures Person: Fan Jichang, a 19-year-old from Chongming, was walking along Avenue Haig in Western Shanghai yesterday afternoon when a stray bullet suddenly struck his left leg, causing him to fall to the ground injured. He was taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Overview of This Year's Unified University Entrance Examination (3) - Overview by Section Chief Huang Longxian of the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(5) Scoring Standards</p>
<p>Grading and scoring are just as important as setting the questions in assessing exam performance. The Unified Entrance Examination Committee is not directly responsible for the grading and scoring; rather, it is handled by each admission district. However, the Unified Entrance Examination Committee first establishes grading and scoring standards to ensure a relatively consistent approach across all districts. Due to the large number of districts, vast geographical area, numerous exam papers, and difficult transportation, this approach is necessary. This year, there were a total of 20,006 examinees. Each examinee had at least seven exam papers, resulting in a total of over 140,000 exam papers. For distant examination districts such as Shanghai and Yanping, the transportation time would be at least one month. If each grader could review a maximum of 100 exam papers per day, it would take 140 people ten days to review 140,000 exam papers. Centralized grading is not feasible due to transportation, time, and personnel constraints. Therefore, regional grading is necessary. As the examination method is not new, establishing highly objective standards for grading and scoring is difficult. Thus, only a few relatively objective principles were established: (1) In addition to setting the questions, the question-setting committee must also establish a grading standard for each question, outlining the possible scenarios for each question, such as fully correct, partially correct, incorrect, or excellent, good, average, below average, and poor, and specifying the corresponding score for each category. The total score is based on 100 points. (2) The exam questions for each subject must be graded question by question by the grading committee, in accordance with the scoring standards outlined in the previous section. (3) Separate standards are established for physical education practical tests. Although these three regulations seem simple, they cover the important principles. In addition, regional grading is not a problem in examination districts with national universities. In areas without national universities, examination districts must be established for practical reasons, such as Lanzhou, Enshi, Taihe, Yongkang, Qujiang, and Zhenping, with Nanzheng, Chongqing, Guilin, and the Zhejiang University branch campus serving as their grading districts. This eliminates any potential difficulties.</p>
<p>(6) Regulations for Recommendation and Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>In addition to examination-based admission, the Unified Entrance Examination also adopts a recommendation system. I explained the reasons for this in the previous section. Last year, students recommended for admission without examination were limited to the top 15% of high school graduation exam passers. Graduates of national high schools were limited to those with "A" grades (overall average score of 80 or above). If the number of students with "A" grades exceeded 15% of the high school graduates in that school, the top 15% of students with the highest scores would be recommended. The regulations are stricter this year: those in the top 10% of high school graduation exams are eligible, a decrease of 5% from last year. The recommendation of outstanding national high school graduates for admission without examination has been completely abolished. However, this year, in addition to provinces with graduation exams being able to recommend students for admission without examination according to regulations, preparatory classes and provinces in occupied areas can also recommend students. Preparatory classes can recommend the top 25% of students with the best grades. Provinces in occupied areas can recommend 20% of their high school graduates this year. The original purpose of establishing preparatory classes was to provide students who did not participate in or were not admitted to the Unified Entrance Examination last year with the opportunity for preparatory studies. They are a type of preparatory school between high school and university, similar to the university preparatory courses of the past, but not actually university preparatory courses, because university preparatory courses allow students to enter university without further examination. Students from preparatory classes must still pass an entrance examination to enter university. Students completing the preparatory class program do not have special qualifications, but they have one year more training than high school graduates, so a system of recommendation for admission without examination is necessary. Due to the special circumstances in occupied areas and the difficulty of taking the examination, a system of recommendation is also necessary and essential. In addition, there are two types of preferential treatment this year: one for students from Mongolia and Tibet, and one for overseas Chinese students. Mongolia and Tibet are located in border areas, and the academic level of students there is naturally not comparable to students from the interior. Overseas Chinese students receive education abroad that differs from that of the motherland. Preferential treatment and lenient admission must be adopted for these students in examinations. This is already mandated by law.</p>
<p>(7) Restrictions on Equivalent Educational Qualifications</p>
<p>The admission of students with equivalent educational qualifications by universities is a new regulation that started last year. Equivalent educational qualification naturally means having academic ability equivalent to that of a high school graduate. In other words, it means that although one has not graduated from high school, their academic ability is equal to that of a high school graduate. It is not a matter of qualifications, but of level. Before the promulgation of the University Organization Law, taking the university entrance examination with equivalent educational qualifications was permitted by law. However, the examination methods were not strict enough, leading to abuse. Therefore, this regulation was abolished, and examinations relied solely on qualifications. Many talented students were inevitably buried due to this restriction. Therefore, the Unified Entrance Examination last year granted special permission for those with equivalent educational qualifications to register for the examination, but stipulated that the number of admitted students could not exceed 10% of the total number of admitted students. The regulations are even stricter this year: students with equivalent educational qualifications must submit a detailed resume when registering for the examination, and the number of admitted students cannot exceed 10% of the total number of admitted students. Furthermore, admission is limited to the top half of the total ranking of admitted students in each district. Although the admission percentage remains the same at 10%, the method is much stricter.</p>
<p>In addition to the seven points mentioned above, there are two more important matters: the admission standards and the allocation method. These two are the backbone of the Unified Entrance Examination and will be discussed in separate sections later. To summarize, the differences between this year's Unified Entrance Examination and last year's are: (1) There are more examination districts and locations this year, and the distribution is more widespread. (2) More schools are participating in the examination, including the various institutions in Shanghai. (3) The exam questions are unified. (4) The proportion of recommendations is smaller. (5) The limit on equivalent educational qualifications is stricter. (6) Students from Mongolia and Tibet and overseas Chinese students will be admitted leniently. (7) There are more applicants, and the percentage of admissions is smaller. (8) Allocation considers both preferences and performance, as well as region, adopting the established methods of last year. The Unified Entrance Examination is an innovation, and we must thank the efforts of last year's organizers for providing such a well-established precedent to follow.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Has Not Recently Sent Personnel to Shanghai to Inspect Education; Official Statement of Facts</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Air Mail) Recently, rumors circulated in Shanghai that the Ministry of Education had sent personnel to inspect education at all levels of schools and social education, and to complete and submit survey forms, as well as register unemployed teachers and staff. The Ministry of Education has denied all of these claims. According to an official, the Ministry of Education has assigned personnel to be fully responsible for educational affairs in Shanghai, maintaining regular contact with the heads of various schools. Any routine inspections by Ministry personnel are conducted with proper credentials and accompanied by official notification for the completion of forms. There has been absolutely no recent dispatch of additional personnel to conduct inspections, order the completion of survey forms, or register unemployed teachers and staff. The recent rumors circulating in Shanghai appear to be deliberate attempts to sow confusion.</p>

<h3>Grain Prices: Japanese Side Reportedly Willing to Cooperatively Eliminate Rice Panic with Concession Authorities; If Supply Sources Are Truly Unimpeded... Rice Prices Can Drop; Hoping... Price Limits Are Strictly Enforced... Differentiated According to Grade</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although only a dozen or so trucks arrived from various domestic suppliers, the market, since the implementation of price controls, should be difficult to manipulate on the whole. At the opening of the morning market, both buyers and sellers were eager to sell, and hoarders and speculators continued to release their previously hoarded goods. The market was flooded with returned goods, and transactions were scarce, causing prices to fall steadily. Approaching midday, regardless of whether it was early rice or glutinous rice, prices fell sharply, with losses exceeding one yuan. Until almost noon, after the various goods had been thoroughly discounted, local shops took the opportunity to inquire, and the situation gradually became more active, with prices rising step by step. However, the result was that the prices in the morning market had already been thoroughly discounted, and although there was a slight rebound, they were still down by three or four cents to five or six cents compared to the previous market. The recent surge in rice prices in Shanghai is due to unscrupulous collusion and mutual exploitation. Rice prices in the suburbs of Shanghai are generally no more than twenty-two or twenty-three yuan (in places like North Bridge, Caohejing, etc.). Therefore, some people use bicycles to transport rice, carrying four or five pecks each time, and making two or three trips back and forth, with profits exceeding ten yuan. This has aroused the Japanese side's concern, resulting in the detention of more than four hundred of these bicycles the day before yesterday (see yesterday's newspaper). It is also heard that a large number of rice boats have been detained in Minhang, with masts like a forest, unable to proceed. If this rice can still supply the Shanghai market, it will be difficult for manipulators, even with strong backing. Now it is heard that a Japanese spokesperson has expressed a willingness to do their best to assist the two concession authorities in resolving the speculation in rice and other grains, and has also stated that the Japanese army, in order to show its sincerity in cooperation, will transport a large quantity of rice to Shanghai in the coming days to balance the uneven market prices until the rice panic in this port is completely resolved. This is what is reported in the French-language Japanese newspaper. If this is the case, the source of rice and other grains in Shanghai should not be hindered, and there is great hope for a drop in rice prices. However, it is essential to have strict management of the market to prevent unscrupulous elements from causing trouble. There are rumors in the market that a small number of unscrupulous merchants are selling rice at the controlled price while demanding as much as fifty-four yuan for better-grade rice. It should be known that the controlled price refers to the top-grade rice. Medium-grade rice should be priced differently, but differentiated pricing depends on the efforts of those enforcing the regulations and the determination of the industry to rectify itself. This newspaper already discussed this in yesterday's editorial.</p>
<p>During the strict enforcement of price limits, some hoarders sought to sell off their stock of early Indica rice in the morning, and the supply from the Yangtze River has not been interrupted, so the market sentiment has gradually stabilized. In the morning market, prices once fell by one and a half yuan, but later, shops took advantage of the small drop to absorb the supply, and the market rebounded. In the end, prices were down by about one yuan. Early Indica rice was sold at thirty-seven yuan, with second-grade rice at thirty-six yuan, totaling 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>In addition to a new shipment of foreign rice, there are more than 40,000 bags that are expected to arrive today, and both firms and merchants are releasing their stock. The morning market saw a sharp drop of more than one and a half yuan, but prices rebounded slightly after small-scale sales. Statistics show that 3,000 bags of spot goods were sold, with Saigon rice priced at thirty-seven and a half yuan, with second-grade rice at thirty-six yuan, and broken rice at thirty-three yuan. Returned goods from the road amounted to 400 to 500 tons, with original packages initially opening at forty-four yuan, then rebounding to forty-four and a half yuan. Forward orders were not placed. According to a telegram from foreign merchants, even second-grade rice would cost forty-four to forty-five yuan.</p>
<h3>Manipulating Food Prices: Focus on Flour</h3>
<p>Since rice prices were controlled, hoarders temporarily had no opportunity to exploit rice, and have shifted their manipulation to flour, which has the same value as rice. This has been the case for several days. Yesterday, factory prices continued to increase, with second-grade flour changing to eight yuan and five cents, an increase of one cent from before. Although various factories are increasing the price to customers by three or four cents, they are still reluctant to sell, so the price of returned goods in the market is becoming increasingly high. Green Cannon and Dongfeng flour have already risen to eight yuan and nine cents and nine yuan, respectively. However, the situation eased somewhat in the afternoon, as the concession authorities have been strictly cracking down on rice hoarding, causing speculators to be wary. It is heard that Japanese factories are holding back their newly hoarded flour to observe the market. Phoenix brand flour for December has rebounded to eight yuan, one cent, seven or eight cents, and for January, it has also decreased slightly to eight yuan, five cents, six or seven cents.</p>
<p>Wheat prices are rising even more sharply, as the source of supply is frequently blocked, and those holding goods are deliberately hoarding them for higher prices. Factories and hoarders are eager to purchase, making the market even more brisk. Fufeng factory purchased 2,000 bags of wheat from Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuhu, reaching a new high price of fourteen yuan and two cents. Market transactions also amounted to more than twenty truckloads. Suzhou wheat was priced at fourteen yuan and seven cents, Danyang wheat at fourteen yuan, and Changzhou wheat at thirteen yuan and nine cents.</p>
<h3>Finance: Ministry of Finance Advises Against Further Trading; Gold Market Has Many Selling Off at Inflated Prices; However, Hong Kong Banks Are Still Buying</h3>
<p>The cash gold "烚赤" grey market trended weaker yesterday. This was because foreign exchange rates were easing, and reports said that the Ministry of Finance specially telegraphed the four major banks and the municipal chamber of commerce, instructing them to immediately forward the advice to jewelers in Shanghai not to continue private buying and selling. Therefore, some investors who had bet on rising prices, in light of such an environment, temporarily had the idea of selling off. As a result, there were quite a few chips in the market. Fortunately, the Hong Kong banks did not change their consistent style of entering the market to buy, and the major bullish investors still had good intentions, taking the opportunity to buy more when prices were low. Therefore, the result was only a drop of twenty-four yuan. The morning opening price fell by thirty-four yuan to four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan due to the influence of the relatively weak foreign exchange market. Subsequently, the Hong Kong banks and a certain money exchange business successively bought aggressively, once reaching four thousand one hundred and seventy-five yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market eased again, and the Hong Kong banks had also stopped buying, so the noon closing price was only four thousand one hundred and fifty-eight yuan. The afternoon situation was flat, and the closing price was four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan. There were few large transactions throughout the day, but the volume was still more than 2,000 taels. Jewelers reduced the price of gold jewelry by five yuan, and customs gold, etc., remained unchanged.</p>
<p>"烚赤" dropped twenty-four yuan</p>
<p>In the morning, the initial opening price for each "bar" (ten taels) fell by thirty-four yuan because the foreign exchange market eased after opening. Jewelers and money exchange businesses competed to press down prices to sell, extending to the 9:35 am opening of the "烚赤" market, dropping by thirty-four yuan. A money exchange sold one tael to a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Subsequently, under selling pressure, it dropped another ten yuan, reaching a low of four thousand one hundred and forty yuan. Some gold shops and securities businesses absorbed some of this. Later, as foreign exchange stopped easing and recovered slightly, sellers gradually decreased, and prices gradually rose back to four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. At this time, Hong Kong banks suddenly began to buy, entrusting a jeweler and a gold shop to buy on their behalf, so the price rose by another ten yuan. During this period, some gold shops and securities businesses took the opportunity to sell off a lot of their holdings, realizing profits. Thereafter, as foreign exchange recovered slightly, and a certain money exchange had a strong appetite for buying, the price rose another ten yuan. A securities business sold twenty taels to a jeweler for four thousand one hundred and seventy-five yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange market hardened, buyers gradually decreased, and jewelers and money exchange businesses frequently sold, dropping back to four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. At noon, a gold shop came back to buy, raising the price by five yuan. A gold shop bought twenty taels from a money exchange for four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan. Subsequently, a jeweler sold twenty taels to a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and fifty-eight yuan, which was the noon closing price. The initial opening price in the afternoon fell by eight yuan because the foreign exchange market was hardening. A cash gold shop sold ten taels to a money exchange for four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Later, Hong Kong banks bought a hundred and several tens of taels, pulling the price up by fourteen yuan. A money exchange bought ten taels from a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and sixty-four yuan. After that, Hong Kong banks stopped their activity, and jewelers still had a selling appetite, dropping back to four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Later, a gold shop bought several tens of taels, immediately bringing the price back up by ten yuan. A gold shop bought twenty taels from a money exchange for four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, the price dropped twenty-four yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by only thirty-five yuan throughout the day. Cash gold shops sold their own brand of gold at a price a few yuan higher than the "烚赤" price, but the purchase price had to be reduced by twenty yuan. The current price of standard gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>The price of jewelry fell by five yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores was still four hundred and twenty-five yuan for Da Tong Heng. The price was reduced by five yuan at 9:38 am, and there were no changes after that. In the end, Da Tong Heng changed the price to four hundred and twenty yuan. The price of new shops was the same as the above price, with the purchase price reduced by fifteen yuan or so.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market: Few Buyers</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no changes in the listed prices of HSBC. The trend in the gray market for British and American exchange rates was easing, but it was still able to hold steady, because a certain HSBC bank and others had bought large amounts. As a result, the exchange rates only eased by .0625 and .15625. In the morning, the sharp rise of one cent in the exchange rate between the US and British currencies caused the market opening to indicate a flat pound and an easing dollar. Subsequently, as Hong Kong brokers first dumped stock, and then the Chinese cotton yarn and flower traders sold off their holdings, the market weakened at 9:20, already showing a loose price of 4 辦士 5 625 and 7 yuan 50 cents. Some foreign banks such as HSBC absorbed a lot of the holdings. Before long, importers saw an opportunity and began to buy, so the situation recovered slightly, once having shouted out prices of 4 辦士 5 1625 and 7 yuan 40625, but few transactions at the higher prices were heard. Then, as buyers disappeared and foreign banks had a willingness to supply, it was again unable to hold and began to weaken again. By the noon close, the exchange rates were 4 辦士 5 46875 and 7 yuan 46875. In the afternoon, the market situation continued to be slightly tighter in silence, as foreign banks such as Hua Bi and Hong Kong Telegraph had stock to sell. As a result, the market closed at 4 辦士 5 625 and 7 yuan 50 cents. As for futures trading, although there were still people opening positions, the underlying trend was still the same as the spot market.</p>
<p>HSBC's settlements turned slightly steadier</p>
<p>In the morning, the prices for both near-term and far-term London big bars were up 1.875. The price of silver in New York remained flat. The price of raw gold in London was unchanged. The exchange rates between British currency and American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The American currency was up two cents against the British currency, unchanged against the Shanghai currency, and up 1.75 cents against the French currency. The listed prices for various currencies at the Central Bank remained the same. The opening selling prices for spot currencies at banks in the morning were 4 辦士半 for British currency and 7 yuan 375 for American currency, with British currency flat and American currency down .03125 compared to the previous close, due to the increase in exchange rates. After the opening, Hong Kong Telegraph first dumped stock, and at the same time, Chinese cotton yarn and flower traders also came to compete to sell, so the market immediately showed easing. Hong Kong Telegraph and Chinese traders sold spot British currency at 4 辦士 5 3125 and 5625 and spot American currency at 7 yuan 4375 to a certain bank and HSBC, and the American currency for this month at 7 yuan 50 cents. The HSBC listing revealed no changes. The silver equalization tax revealed a increase of one cent. After that, the selling pressure subsided, so the situation stabilized. Before long, importers suddenly came to buy, causing the market situation to recover slightly. Foreign firms settled spot British currency at 4 辦士 5 3225 and spot American currency at 7 yuan 4375. Afterwards, the prices were shouted down to 4 辦士 5 1625 and 7 yuan 40625, but no transactions were heard. Then, as foreign banks' willingness to sell increased, and the buyers had disappeared, the situation again became tighter. An American bank dumped the American currency for this month at 7 yuan 50 cents to HSBC. Until the afternoon, the banks' selling prices for spot currencies were 4 辦士 5 46875 for British currency and 7 yuan 46875 for American currency, with British currency down .046875 and American currency up .09375 compared to the morning opening prices.</p>
<p>British and American closing prices continued to show easing</p>
<p>Trading in the later market was still very scarce, but the situation continued to show a slight easing. A certain Chinese bank sold American currency notes at 7 yuan 50 cents to a money exchange, and then Hua Bi also sold the American currency for this month at 7 yuan 50 cents to the same industry. At the same time, it was heard that Hong Kong Telegraph also sold spot American currency at 7 yuan 50 cents to foreign banks. There was very little trading in British currency. Afterwards, the situation became even more silent. Until the evening close, the banks' selling prices for spot currencies were 4 辦士 5 625 for British currency and 7 yuan 50 cents for American currency. The prices for the current month were 4 辦士 5 46875 for British currency and 7 yuan 46875 for American currency, and the prices for January were 4 辦士 5 3125 for British currency and 7 yuan 375 for American currency. As a result, the closing prices for both spot and futures British currency were down .0625, and both spot and futures American currency were up .15625 compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>Securities: Large Numbers of Rubber Shares Taken for Profits; Domestic Debt Still Stagnant</h3>
<p>The situation in the gray market for securities remained quiet and wait-and-see yesterday. Transactions among the various groups were even scarcer. However, the underlying environment has changed significantly, and although there may be a day of breakout, the trend of government bonds yesterday did not break free from the inherent pattern of recent days. Market prices still rose and fell within a range of 5 to 10 cents, and the stagnation remained unchanged. Therefore, the result was still a mix of highs and lows, ranging from 5 to 20 cents, with a total turnover of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. A brief summary is provided below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange were traded at a price of 10 yuan.

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton: Eager to Sell Off Holdings; Yarn Prices Plunge; 20-Count Yarn Drops Another 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be weak and scattered. This was because the inventory of 20-count cotton yarn was too high. After several days of rising prices, those who had profited could earn tens of yuan, and they have already sold off their holdings to realize profits. As a result, the situation eased, and selling pressure became even greater. The market could not hold up and tended to fall. However, in the overseas cotton market, Indian cotton has stabilized, but American cotton is advancing all the way. However, given the former situation, the human spirit could not be aroused. However, the high cost of raw materials will inevitably increase future costs.</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market in the morning, some scalpers were shouting prices to each other. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 735 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan from the previous day, with 10 bales traded. As soon as this price opened, there were many people seeking to sell, but no one was willing to accept the offer, and the market rapidly declined. Later, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was slightly weaker, and human sentiment became more relaxed. The market fell straight to 718 yuan at the close. Afterwards, there was a slight rebound. It was found that 2,030 bales were traded in half a day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 11 yuan, Double Earth fell by 10 yuan, and Heavenly Maiden fell by 10 yuan. Xinyu Factory opened 600 bales of 20-count Double Earth for this month at 710 yuan, and 600 bales for the next month at 725 yuan. Today, 60 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 30 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amount of yarn purchased by various groups is listed below:</p>
<p>Same Trade 1,690 bales, Hong Kong 50 bales, Yunnan 20 bales</p>
<p>Inland 200 bales, Jiangxi 60 bales, Total 2,030 bales</p>
<h3>US Cotton Export Subsidies Reduced to 20 Pounds: Shanghai Factory Activity Is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Transactions in local cotton were slightly calmer. Factories still showed no activity, and human sentiment was relatively flat. Because yarn prices could not rise actively and the trend was not broad, factories were unwilling to buy raw materials. However, with foreign cotton so expensive, local cotton was still cheaper, so although transactions among the same industry decreased, few people were bearish on the market price. The price of white-wrapped cotton was roughly the same as the previous day. Sudanese cotton, which is the raw material for spinning 32-count yarn, was sold for 226 yuan. The asking price for Brazilian cotton, which is the raw material for spinning 42-count yarn, was 250 yuan in the market. The source of cotton from Northern Jiangsu was quiet again. Only 849 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock, and 3,670 bales arrived from Beisha. Today, 120 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The current situation of cotton is listed below:</p>
<p>Chongtong 162.00 yuan, 152 bales purchased by the same industry</p>
<p>Tongzhou 167.10 yuan, also 66 bales</p>
<p>Fine velvet in bales 182.00 yuan, also 100 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou 166.00 yuan, also 532 bales</p>
<p>Also 165.50 yuan, also 231 bales</p>
<p>Also 168.00 yuan, also 222 bales</p>
<p>Hangzhou burlap 155.00 yuan, also 185 bales</p>
<p>Chongtong 162.00 yuan, also 200 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou 167.10 yuan, also 200 bales</p>
<p>Sudan 226.00 yuan, also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Changyinsha 156.00 yuan, also 100 bales</p>
<p>Fire weed bales 157.50 yuan, also 100 bales</p>
<p>Also white bales 158.50 yuan, also 180 bales</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton in New York was exceptionally strong because overseas cotton merchants were competing to buy. Export subsidies were becoming increasingly depleted. Yesterday, US Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wells also announced a reduction of 20 pounds in export subsidies. The remaining amount that can be subsidized for US cotton exports is now only 20 pounds. It is widely believed that this remaining 20 pounds will also be eliminated in the very near future. According to Agriculture Secretary Wallace, since July 27, cotton sold under the export subsidy program has reached 5.7 million bales. Wallace also predicted that the cotton inventory on August 1, 1940, would be 2 million bales less than the previous year. In the New York market, cotton prices rose another 20 pounds due to competition among buyers. The Indian cotton market was flat. Egyptian cotton rose by more than 100 pounds. Liverpool rose by more than 20 pence.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the trading of foreign cotton in terms of forward orders was becoming increasingly quiet due to the US government's repeated reductions in export subsidies and the soaring cotton market. All parties were holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, the same industry, because of the goods previously ordered, was earning huge profits and was eager to sell their holdings. Therefore, their selling prices were much cheaper than those of foreign firms. The factory delivery prices converted to US dollars at 7 yuan 4375 for yesterday's cotton market are as follows:</p>
<p>20-count US Metlin 234.95 yuan</p>
<p>20-count also, lower grade 230.50 yuan</p>
<p>32-count also 242.15 yuan</p>
<p>32-count also, lower grade 235.90 yuan</p>
<p>42-count also 245.75 yuan</p>
<p>42-count also, lower grade 227.70 yuan</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Green and Red Sugar Rise by 1-2 Yuan</h3>
<p>The market for domestic green and red sugar was even tighter yesterday. Huanggang green sugar rose nearly 2 yuan again, with several hundred bales traded at 42.5 yuan. Cotton red sugar also rose by about 1 yuan, with over 200 bales offered at 44 to 42.3 yuan. Several hundred bales of Huizhou white sugar were offered at 54 yuan, 400 bales of ordinary Hainan red sugar were offered at 33 yuan, 200 bales of Dongxiang red sugar were offered at 42 yuan, and several hundred bales of Han red sugar were offered at 41 yuan for the high grade and 37 yuan for the second grade. The exchange's listed price for 24 coarse white sugar was not much different. Wooden warehouse goods were 57.5 yuan, up 50 cents. New foreign warehouse goods were 58.5 yuan to 58.3 yuan, and old goods were 58 yuan to 57.5 yuan. Transshipment goods were still 49 yuan. Taikoo car white sugar was up 1 yuan, B mark Dong warehouse goods were 57 yuan to 96.5 yuan, West warehouse goods were 57.5 yuan, CW was 57.2 yuan, CX mark was 56.9 yuan, DJ mark was 55.4 yuan, Dong warehouse was 55 yuan, HX mark was 54.5 yuan, and H mark car red was up 50 cents at 43 yuan. Dutch red sugar was unchanged, domestic ice sugar was up 50 cents, grade 1 was 67.5 yuan, grade 2 was 67 yuan, and Jingming ice was 69 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Shrimp Tails Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>The third batch of new Annam shrimp tails has arrived in Shanghai, including 23 boxes of field shrimp with a cost of 245 yuan, 6 boxes of Chongdong tails with a cost of 215 yuan, and 9 pieces of Singapore shrimp with a cost of 160 yuan. Domestic products from Jiangbei Juegang House have also arrived, with good quality goods selling for 160 yuan to 170 yuan, which is quite brisk.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Implementing Family Winter Protection</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The north wind roars, the climate is bitterly cold, and the mercury in the thermometer has retreated to its lowest point. Thick clothes have all been moved out of the wardrobe and put on. The withered leaves hanging on the treetops are also falling one by one with the wind, and everything on earth symbolizes the severity of the season.</p>
<p>Theft and fire are the most rampant during this severe winter season. To avoid these unfortunate events, precise prevention is necessary. Therefore, the author would like to suggest the implementation of this family winter protection movement, so that the residents of each house can raise the spirit of mutual assistance and jointly bear the responsibility for family safety. This will not only avoid all unexpected losses and unfortunate encounters for oneself, but also cultivate good disciplined habits!</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Fire Prevention</h3>
<p>In the bedroom: (1) Do not place coal stoves, wind stoves, kerosene stoves, etc. In this severe winter, many people are greedy for warmth and move coal stoves into the bedroom. As a result, unfortunate events of carbon monoxide poisoning and fires have been repeatedly reported in the past. These two unfortunate encounters can lead to the meaningless sacrifice of life. (2) When lying in bed, smoking cigarettes should be absolutely prohibited. If you are momentarily careless and the cigarette butt falls on the quilt, even this spark can become a prairie fire and become uncontrollable. (3) Matches, lit candle stubs, kerosene lamps, etc., should all be placed in fixed and safe places. If there are extremely flammable objects (such as celluloid toys, oiled paper, cotton, etc.), they should be isolated from them. (4) Wastepaper baskets and spittoons should not be placed in the same place. In case a cigarette butt is mistakenly thrown into the wastepaper basket, it can easily cause a fire. (5) Do not place any miscellaneous items at the entrance of the room. In case of a sudden incident, this will not obstruct entry and exit. This point should also be noted.</p>
<p>In the kitchen: (1) Coal balls should be stored in wooden boxes, and firewood should be stacked in a suitable place, and both must be kept away from stoves and oil spills. When not needed, do not place them near the stove. (2) Small pieces of wood and wood shavings for starting fires should be placed in a safe place. (3) Check whether there are any leaks or smoke coming out of the chimney on the stove. Whether there is any ash from the stove left on the ground. Before going to bed at night, carefully and completely extinguish the embers in the stove. (4) Coal stoves must be placed in designated places. Do not place one here and one there, or even one at the door of the room. Thin foreign pine room boards, scorched by coal fire for a long time, are dry and extremely flammable, which is very dangerous. To put it simply, coal stoves or wind stoves should not be placed in any place other than the kitchen. (5) If there is a stove in the room, always check the red coal cinders to prevent them from falling on the floor. Before going to bed, also extinguish the burning coal in the stove. (6) Always pay attention to exposed electrical wires and switches, whether they are damaged, to avoid electric leakage and fire, and the danger of electric shock. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Group Snatching Cotton</h3>
<p>— Hu Di</p>
<p>At the intersection of Tongfu Road, several cargo trucks loaded with cotton bales stopped at the traffic lights. At this moment, a group of vagrants hiding under an advertising board on the street corner darted out like rabbits. Waiting for the traffic lights to change, they used the most agile movements to snatch the snow-white cotton from behind and beside the trucks. The porters sitting on the cotton bales waved their rattan whips around, but this method of expulsion was ineffective. They all knew how to avoid the direction of the whips. Even if they were unfortunately hit hard, they could win more spoils in that moment of opportunity because they could take advantage of the gap when the porters retracted their whips to grab as much as possible.</p>
<p>Passersby on the street corner were captivated by this scene and stopped to watch. However, when the third cargo truck passed the police post, a cotton-snatching man was pulled down by a porter using a rope tied around his neck, like the "Binding Immortal Rope" in "Investiture of the Gods." The man seemed to have completely lost consciousness and was dragged along as the truck accelerated. This even more exciting scene made the onlookers applaud, and some even surged forward, like Roman kings appreciating the brave warriors in the arena being wounded by cruel weapons.</p>
<p>However, the truck had already stopped ahead. Several porters jumped out of the truck, punched the man a few times, scolded him a few times, and then drove away again. This ending may have disappointed the audience. The defeated warrior, unexpectedly, quickly got up, without touching the skin on his neck torn by the rope, nor wiping the bloodstains on his face. He bent down, only to pick up the cotton that he had lost on the road during the battle. He moved so nimbly, filling his waist pockets before striding back to his position – under the advertising board on the street corner. None of his companions paid attention to whether he was injured or not, only patted him on the shoulder to celebrate his victory. Then, everyone put the cotton in a large paper bag and sat down in a sunny place to rest, looking like they were waiting for their second expedition.</p>
<p>After this scene ended, one of the spectators expressed his opinion, saying, "Why don't the police ask or care?"</p>
<p>Yes, this is robbery! But we still remember the news of people deliberately robbing passers-by of their wallets because they had no way to make a living and were willing to go to jail. This group of homeless vagrants, with ropes tied around their necks, being dragged by cars, and being beaten by porters with fists and feet, did not care, and what they fought for with their lives was only less than half a kilogram of cotton. The law can only "turn a deaf ear" to these people.</p>
<p>However, this is a hidden worry of society, and this abnormally developed city is forcing them to embark on a more dangerous path. Only when people are well-fed and clothed will they know shame. It is useless to shake your head and sigh, especially in an era when even being well-fed and clothed does not guarantee that one knows shame!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and Reviving Old Markets; Narrating Marriage Seizures and Tracing Back to Old Customs</p>
<p>Now Wu Junsuo knew that Jin Danyun wanted her to go, not just to be a bridesmaid, but perhaps for other reasons. Apart from the Wu sisters and Shao Huihua, who all had families in Shanghai and didn't need to worry about accommodation, the He sisters and Zhu Airen didn't have families in Shanghai and would have to stay in a hotel. The He sisters were originally from a wealthy family and could choose to stay in the largest hotel in Shanghai, but they knew that Zhu Airen was thrifty and didn't like staying in big hotels. Therefore, they discussed choosing a mid-range hotel that was hygienic. They decided to choose a large room and live together. Although Jin Danyun had called Zhu Airen and booked many rooms for them at the Grand Hotel, asking them to stay there as well, they thought it would be less free and preferred to find their own hotel. So, these six people arrived in Shanghai. Zhu Airen rarely came to Shanghai, and she would definitely drive to the train station to pick them up. Unfortunately, she was too busy today, not only having to entertain Chinese relatives and friends but also a group of foreign friends attending the wedding, all of whom she had to entertain herself. Although Mrs. Sulia was taking on the responsibility of hosting, Mrs. Sulia's own daughter was not yet married. Now that she had come to China, she treated Jin Danyun like a Chinese daughter. However, although Mrs. Sulia was a wealthy American, the new couple, Lin Jiancheng and Yu Danyun, both advocated thriftiness and tried to save money wherever possible. Therefore, their new home was just a not-so-spacious house. It was a three-story building, and the house was very modern, located in the western district of Shanghai. The house was built according to Lin Jiancheng's design. There were several houses in this row, each with a different architectural style. In the past, when building houses, foreign-style houses were often referred to as French, German, or Anglo-American. Now, there was no longer the concept of imitating different countries' styles. Architectural engineers designed the plans themselves, as long as they met the conditions of cleanliness, hygiene, comfort, and beauty, regardless of the country's style. Although the house was not large, the courtyard was still spacious. People cannot live without flowers and trees, so flowers and trees were also planted. Because modern houses are often standardized and all have the same style, Yu Danyun found that style somewhat annoying, so Lin Jiancheng pleased his wife and selected several houses with different styles and asked her to choose one.

<h3>An Interview with Photographer Xu Ming</h3>
<p>— Yinyan</p>
<p>I once happened to see a very magnificent photograph in a British magazine published in London, "The Amateur Photographer." The main subject was a giant ship, and the angle and lighting were beautiful and eye-catching. The caption stated that it was a work by Hsu Ming shagai. It is rare to see works by Chinese photographers in foreign photography publications. Suddenly, I saw that it was a work from Shanghai, and the Pinyin clearly indicated that it was a Chinese person. However, this name was not only unheard of in China, but also could not be found in any photography organization. At the time, I could only wonder in my heart. One evening, I went to Jing'an Temple Road for something and happened to step into a Suzhou candy store to buy some things. On the clean glass counter, I found a pleasing photograph of pine trees and white clouds, which was taken very well. The technique had the same majestic momentum as the one published in the previous magazine. I suspected that it came from the same hand, and carefully inquired with the clerk, only to learn that it was made by their boss, Mr. Xu, but they only knew that his name was "Wenxi" and not Hsu Ming.</p>
<p>Under my sincere request to meet him, Mr. Xu did come out. We exchanged business cards and learned that the Chinese name of this internationally renowned photographer was "Xu Ming." Wenxi was his alias. Because of our shared interests, we had a very投機 chat.</p>
<p>He is a young man around twenty-five or six years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang. His eyes are bright, thin, and energetic, and his pronunciation is loud and his speech is very straightforward. After we talked for an hour, we became good friends.</p>
<p>He has been fond of photography for four or five years. In the past two years, he has participated in major international salons and has won numerous awards and medals. He is recognized internationally as a new artist and has joined the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain for further research.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu has also been selected by the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain as an Associate member of "Artistic Mastery." This degree requires both qualifications and academics and is not easy to be elected. He is the first person in China to achieve this honor.</p>
<h3>Clever Ways to Make Money</h3>
<p>— Minhua</p>
<p>Near a major theater in Hollywood, there lives a fat Mexican woman. She came up with a clever way to make money. When a movie is premiered, she takes four children, buys five four-dollar tickets, and sits in the best seats to wait for people who are late to buy seats from her. Of course, the price is up to her. The highest record is eleven dollars. She makes a living from this, so her monthly income is quite considerable.</p>
<h3>An Open Letter From Loretta Young to a British Magazine</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Loretta Young can truly be considered one of the leading stars in Hollywood today. Her new work, "Eternally Yours," has just finished screening at the Nanjing Grand Theater in this city. Ladies from all walks of life have expressed great admiration for her moving performance in the film. She once wrote an open letter to a British magazine.</p>
<p>At the beginning, she said: "From the letters of fans, I know that the general audience is always looking forward to seeing today's red stars being able to shoot more films and give them a deeper impression. But this is impossible, because when an actor is filming a movie, he often works all day and all night, so after a movie is made, he must get a short period of rest. For this reason, many actors only shoot three movies a year, and I, at most, shoot no more than eight."</p>
<p>Then, she talked a bit about her private affairs, saying: "I now live in Bel Air, which not many people know, so I can avoid a lot of unnecessary disputes. During the filming process, I pay special attention to my clothes, because there are often many photojournalists around me. During holidays, I travel around; but my itinerary is mysterious, otherwise, I am afraid I will suffer unexpected encounters."</p>
<p>Next, she talked about the minimum conditions that an actor should possess:</p>
<p>"First, do not ignore the opinions and wishes of the audience, otherwise, you will not get their support, and your reputation will inevitably decline. Second, whether it is every move, every word, especially female actors, should pay attention to everything. Because there are often many idlers who like to use us to spread rumors or create something out of nothing."</p>
<p>Finally, she said: "A person should dress decently, but not too luxuriously; if you have nothing to do, you may want to run outside, but you cannot overdo it; in the process of life, pride and waste are the two most undesirable things. Everywhere we should have an attitude of compassion and tolerance."</p>
<p>In conclusion, she gave a warning to fans: "In your eyes, you often think that the life and work of an actor who dedicates himself to the screen is meaningless. I will use practical spirit to eliminate this sentence."</p>
<h3>Wang Chen in Northern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>— Pei Fei</p>
<p>Wang Chen, everyone knows that she is the wife of "Tiger" Zheng Junli.</p>
<p>Wang Chen is from Suzhou, but she grew up in Shanghai. After graduating from Qixiu Girls' High School, she went to Jiangwan Shanghai Business College.</p>
<p>Her acquaintance with Junli was very accidental. It was in the Republic of China in the fourth year, a week before the second public performance of "The Government Inspector" by the Shanghai Amateur Drama Association, Junli was rehearsing at the Jincheng Grand Theater, and a Miss Qu (?) (a friend of Gu Menghu) brought Wang Chen to visit. She casually introduced them; who would have thought that just this "meeting" would sow the seeds of love between them, and they would quickly get married on the 25th of October of the following year in the West Hall on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA?</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, this newly married couple left their old home in Shanghai and joined the National Salvation Drama Troupe. From Wuxi through Suzhou to Nanjing and Hankou, and later to Chongqing, they never left the position of theater workers from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend's letter from the interior mentioned their recent situation, saying that Wang Chen had recently entered the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region College and was discussing the theory of national salvation with Li Lin (former Mingxing actress) every day, looking very hardworking; her husband Junli was in Lanzhou, and after staying for a few days, he would probably return to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Guan Dayuan plays (Huang Zhong)</h3>
<h3>Zheng Bingru of (Baolian Deng) [Lotus Lantern]</h3>
<h3>Li Hongchun plays (Guan Gong)</h3>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Guan Dayuan is good at performing old plays such as Yong'an Palace and Hanyang Yuan.</p>
<p>The plot of the play is probably about Liu Bei's defeat by Cao Cao in the battle of Runan. Fortunately, Sun Qian intervened, so he went to rely on Liu Biao, the governor of Jingzhou. Biao treated him very well, but he was bewitched by the words of his successor, Mrs. Cai, and sent Bei to Xinye. Later, Biao became seriously ill and summoned him again, entrusting him with matters after his death. Cao Cao knew that Bei would eventually be a threat to him, so he openly made peace while secretly raising troops. Bei received the letter and rushed back to Xinye, realizing that he could not match the enemy in strength, so he led the old, young, and people to abandon the city and flee. When passing through Jingzhou, Liu Biao had already died. The defending generals Cai Mao and Zhang Yun had advised Biao's second son, Cong, to surrender to Cao Cao upon hearing of Cao Cao's arrival. Bei could not help but grieve greatly for failing the heavy trust. He passed through the Hanyang Plain east of Xiangyang City, visited Liu Biao's tomb, and wrote an eulogy to mourn him. The above is a brief description of the play. This play includes Xipi Daoban, Yuanban, Liushui, and Fanxipi, etc. People say that Liu Bei is a hero, accustomed to being hypocritical and buying people's hearts. Therefore, Cao Cao occupies the right time, Sun Quan gets the geographical advantage, and Liu Bei gets the people's support, thus forming a three-legged situation. However, Bei's weeping for Liu Biao is actually weeping for the people to see. Therefore, the lyrics of Fanxipi include a set of words to buy people's hearts: "It is truly regrettable, the good people of Fancheng and Xinye, watching them one by one, supporting the old and carrying the young, climbing mountains and wading through water, embarking on the journey, I am so heartbroken!..." When the people heard it, they would of course rather die than leave this benevolent lord. Therefore, the actor who plays this play must first be able to express Liu Bei's love for the people like his own children to be considered to have grasped the true meaning of the play. Although the name of the play is "Crying for Liu Biao," the main point is still on the people. Because Liu's deep popularity with the people started with this, the performer must know this. Dayuan came to Shanghai and showed his beauty to the people. I very much hope that he can perform this kind of old play that is about to be lost, and I expect it will be very popular. (159)</p>
