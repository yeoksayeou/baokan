<h3 id="c15">維持民食唯一之希望 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>自米價高漲，望其出新而稍得低落者，今則仍得其反，頻頻上騰，前日竟一度見四十五元之新高價。同時豆油之價，每担至一百十餘元，粉價亦至八元零，其餘日常生活之品，莫不隨之作同樣之步趨，一貴而百貴，照實際上今日法幣一元之購買力，尙恐不及戰前百分之三十五。滬上雖號稱富饒，然大多數爲薪工階級，以有限之收人，供無限之支出，未有不拮据萬分，庚癸頻呼。一般無業流民更無論已，乞食無門，謀生無路，風霜交追，鋌而走險，飢寒起盜心，法所必懲，顧可憫矣。</p>
<p>在滬戰初作，米價曾由十二三元至十七八元，一時人心騷動，搶米之事迭出。卒以各方面之協力，組織米糧調節委員會，復由工部局出而訂購巨額洋米，陸續運滬接濟，使米價復歸於平準，民食利賴；以迄於今年靑黃不接時期，始行暴變。當時工部局亦嘗一度加以限制，卒以奸商囤戶，破壞不遺餘力，而工部局又不能爲進一步之處置，於是限價一破，如河決橫流，不可收拾。本報於本年五月間，即以當時之限價如有需要，則應如何規定施行；如無此需要，則應如何使米價不爲操縱所制，仍歸於安定。又以爲亂世易投機，欲使米市投機之風減至最低度，則公開評價，集中買賣，平勻分配，有不可或缺者矣。乃不爲時賢所措意，致今日米市，幾全爲囤戶投機所操縱。及糧價髙漲無際，民心不安已極，雖口誅筆伐，呼籲時聞，爲無實力相制裁，仍不足以遏奸商之氣燄，循是而往，究將何所底止？此吾人不得不屬望於今日負有保護市民維持治安之責之工部局，本其維持民食之初衷，一如滬戰發生後之努力，與地方各公團協作，規畫具體方案，採取有效處置，任勞任怨，破除情面，安定民生，爲數百萬市民之救生寳筏也。</p>
<p>或謂就各方面情形以爲觀察，米價之平準匪易，此其言誠然，然亦只患無維持民食之決心，有之，事亦易爲。查上海米價之所以貴，由於來源不暢，囤戶投機乃得乘隙而入；旣有所囤，必求有所獲，遂又利用其資力，虛張其聲勢，明進暗出，在抬硬撐，有如新竹解　，脫頴而出，節節上升矣。至來源不暢之爲因正多，有內在，有外鑠，非片言所能盡。蓋民食問題者，一事實問題也，就事論事，以策應付，尙難洞見其癥結所在，猶不免夫閉門造車之誚。非可以憑空諭斷，非可以不健全，不切實際之統計爲衡量，非可以誇妄之談收挽救之效；蓋務必以悲天憫人之懷，作對症下藥之計。要知目前所須解決者如何可使上海民食來源不虞阻礙橫生。此則別無他途，只有由工部局商請領事團向日方嚴重交涉，嗣後凡由內地運滬之米糧，或將來經工部局登記赴內地採運米糧之船隻，車輛任何方面，皆不得加以攔阻留難，藉以充實上海之民食，即所以維持上海之　安，此其一。</p>
<p>集中　糧買賣於一市塲。近來米業亦已有鑒及此，並經一再通告，整頓業規；然就事實所表示，仍不能杜絕塲外交易，大有掮客操縱莫可如何之狀。此其眞實內容，究屬如何，固非局外人所能盡知；但米市塲喪其控制之實力，此則未可諱言。夫買賣不集中，易於操縱，亦不便監察。故米業自身苟缺乏力量以實施業規，則在非常時期，工部局應接受米業之請求，出而協助；或逕由工部局派員常駐市塲，監督指導，無使越軌，此亦爲貢有維持地方民食之責者應有之職權，此其二。</p>
<p>米糧之操縱投機，爲業中人，抑爲業外人，可不必問，二者殆必兼而有之。且業外人之操縱，無業中人爲之引綫，決不能有爲，惟在今生活嚴重情况之下，猶以人生所不可一日或缺之米糧，用爲操縱發財之工具，尙得謂之稍有人心乎？夫囤戶之敢於作祟，由於不爲申儆耳。苟得擇其允者，公布社會，與衆共棄，則囤戶多少知所儆戒，自不敢過分操縱。如是可使逐日到米，逐日以應市民之需求，則數量縱少，亦不至造成今日之米價，惟其用有限之到源，供囤戶無饜之搜求二遂使日常民食所需，反形支絀。今則得由工部局出而實地調查囤戶姓名，及其囤積地點數量，先之以去函警吿，如有怙惡不悛，則能援用刑章，提起公許，處以妨害農工商之罪刑固佳，不則或處以罰鍰，或徵發其所囤，以濟民食之所需，，此其三。</p>
<p>但欲平準米價，固需政治上之權力，而權力亦有時爲事實所牽掣，不能充分發揮。本報嘗謂米糧尙非不足之爲患，實由調節之難行，證之於今日情形，益覺可信。其時尙爲外滙消耗於雜糧者已鉅，若再加以洋米結款，消耗更多爲慮，故不力主購買洋米。今則屆出新時期，猶難收調節之效，更啟囤積之風，自惟有定購洋米，以應市銷，雖似飲酖止渴但可以奪奸商之魄。由此而得米價漸平，則投機之風亦戢，洋米之需要自減，是影響外滙亦非甚鉅也。一面勸告各大公司廠號，爲其所屬職工，墊款預購洋米，照進本轉售於同人，稍紆其仰屋之嗟。一面由公家舉辦平價米，以應貧苦小民之食用，此其四。</p>
<p>凡此四端僅言其大略，至如何管制民食，平準糧價，兼及於日用生活必需之品，應就事實，量爲處置，非本文範圍所能盡舉。滬市人民苦生活之憔悴久矣！爲能解除其倒懸之苦者，舍工部局別無可以任此艱鉅；則其所望於工部局者，宜不啻若大旱之望雲霓。但望工部局尊重輿論，顧及民意，有以副數百萬市民之望；惠政所及，豈僅絲繡平原而已哉！</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>本來以秘密外交為原則的蘇聯、經過最近蘇，德，協定簽字後、各方面的宣傳　傳說，與另有用意造謠，這一業，對牠的眞正向，令大家更加有了目迷五色的傾向中。</p>
<p>還有，因為德國的根本出賣了日本，日本方面，因此，就感到了自己前途的十分危險，那就可以想像而知的。於是，以日本宣傳機關為根原，當然的，也就在散佈着種種的憑空揑造。這些揑造呢，在這裏也偶爾可以看到一點；可是並不多。就近來見到幾件而論，那作用，大槪地歸納推尋起來，是：　以中國將「赤化」為題目，在煽動着英·美·資本主義者停止援助中國；轉而去替日本帮兇，而名義則是「反共」。　可是一二轉臉，又在說蘇聯「要赤化」中國；這意思，在於離間中國與蘇聯間的邦交。　不過這個臉又冉一轉的時候，那說法却又成了日·蘇·已取得默契，日本也可「自由在遠東行動」；這一次的意思，却是非常明显的，　辣的，分化中國內部的企圖在內。因而跟着就说，由日本軍部和浪人牽綫的中國傀儡戲，　在中國「內部爭議」的機會裏，要袍笏登塲了，現在的「日蘇默契」和「中國內部爭議」却就是這一齣猴兒戲的「閙台」　鼓。</p>
<p>因此，我想劈頭就說：上面三種的造謠，全是意想天開的胡說八道，在這裏一點效騐也沒收到；相反的，作為一個宣傳的技巧而論，却閙了一個笑話，暴露了日人自己的半生半熟。</p>
<p>我們不得不承識事實：自從蘇·德協定答字以來，這二十多天內，蘇聯的外交舉動，的確的，是越出了牠的常軌；連英，法·兩國的共產黨，對牠，也在難以追尋出象跡和未來發展。法國的共產黨，因此遭受了空前的重大打擊，一面內部起了分裂，一面又受了政府的解散處置。在英國呢，政府方面，並沒有採了特殊處置，不過，現在英國共產黨內部，也在醖釀着大大的纠纷，大槪现任秘書長的伯力特，十之八九，要　第三國筆法及蘇聯的舉措，都在無條件地擁護，不過，一讀文意，那內心上對蘇聯這一次舉措的反感，及其內心的不安，是躍然於紙上的。</p>
<p>可是，透過了一切的浮言與陰影，在那根底的深處，分明地，我們可以看到蘇聯態度的去跡與來踪。</p>
<p>首先，我们必须認清一點：蘇聯這一次的舉動，完完全全的，是處在被動的地位。我在「國際形勢新推展」那篇通訊裏，也曾經說過，蘇聯的意思，完全是防禦。這些天來的蘇聯舉措，把牠的基本用意，尤其一天一天地在表明了出來。</p>
<p>蘇聞與德國締結協定，在當前的形勢下，牠當然是客觀地助成了德國對波蘭的用兵，但這樣做，牠也替自己冒了兩　大大的危險。一重是當前的危險，萬一德國掃平波蘭軍力。英·法·因此感到對德的難以力取，轉而繼續讓步，和德國來一個「和平」，接下去，再做醖釀進攻蘇聯　字軍的迷夢。這一路綫，是頗為英·法·一般反動派目前在提倡着的。「和平」告成後怎样呢？那时候，希特拉是眞正达到了平生黄金时代，而左右逢源起来；对英·法·以「反共　为口號　先鋒為威脅，去索取原料的接濟，和外交上的不干預。那樣形勢下，蘇聯與英·法·地位的危險性，是絕對沒有什麼上下的。還有一重是最根本的危險：確如此地一位著名的共產黨領袖所說：「任何法西斯勢力，在世界任何區域內的膨脹，直接間接，對蘇聯　是威脅一。蘇聯斯太林專政以來的唯一中心政策，就是用盡一切方法和力量，去發展鞏固而目保衛這唯一社會主義的國家。可是，在這資本帝國主義國家　立的世界，對於像德國那樣反動的　制，蘇聯是會額觀地去鞏固牠的對內政權對外威力麼？當然是絕對不會的！那末，難道斯太林眞已經相信了希特拉的自拉自唱，備國可以「赤化」麼？這更是一個天大的笑話！</p>
<p>大槪蘇聯的估計，在蘇·德·協定一簽字後，波蘭對德的態度，會突然軟化下來，與德國取得妥協，備國一轉臉，去把刀鋒西向，直指向英·法去，這在蘇聯，恐怕是理想的可能形勢。然而這種可能，在目前固然已經因為戰事擴大而完全消滅，即使在締約的當時，以波蘭這些年來向外發展急切的氣勢而論，任何人也不敢說有十二分的把握。</p>
<p>近來，在此地，也有一派理論在這麼說：蘇聞的意思，當然是在於引起英，法，與德，意，間大虞，一至時機成熟，就來一個「世界革命」。這些話，純理論的立塲上，也許可以站得住的：不過，當我們把牠和實際形勢一連貫時，我們立刻發現，這絕對不足以說明這一次蘇聞外交　——我以前也曾　經說過。——大前提是，這一次英，法，與德，意，兩面，是滯願意大戰，在當時和現在，都是非常可以疑問的事。</p>
<p>比如這兩天來，因為波蘭軍隊的不斷敗退，德國的氣燄，是非常的逼入了，這樣，為了萬一的凖備，蘇聯就不得不在西邊國防綫上，動員了大批的軍隊。假如沒有蘇，德，協定，何至於有　一舉！那末，看起來，蘇聯是在自找煩惱？而這個煩惱呢，越下去，是會越多了起來。令而後，蘇聯的閉門建設環境，不得不被部份地犧牲了。到底牠是不是自我煩惱？絕不是！</p>
<p>蘇聞這一次冒了重大的危險，採取了非常的外交措置，在消極方面，牠是在避免張伯倫流入反共　字軍的陰謀，在積極方面，牠是在打算一勞永逸地在隣近各國，由北冰洋直到黑海，裏海之間，自己動手來組成一個對帝國主義者們的防禦地帶，緩衝地帶。</p>
<p>然而，今而後的蘇聯國際環境，確是較前十倍百倍地增加了麻煩和危險！在這未來的國際形勢裏，牠所倚賴的，是什麼呢？</p>
<p>牠的最大倚賴，毫無疑問的，是牠自己的龐大工農紅軍，和經濟建設。</p>
<p>其次，蘇聯的現當局，固然不　信社會革命可以像花草一樣的由甲地移值乙地，同時，也否認一個國家無單獨建立社會主義體制的可能，因而必須發動所謂「世界革命　：不過，在資本帝國主義間鬥爭日益緊張尖銳的這個世界上，一個虛無縹渺與世無爭的單獨社會主義國家樂園，也絕對難以無限期地存在於現實世界。因此牠的第二個武器和倚賴，就是世界上所有的被　及各資本主義老巢裏的無產階級的鬥爭。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我們不得不想到蘇聯在歐，亞，　竟和地位　之前，蘇聞東　確確實實的，是在受着帝國主義們的夾攻；可是今天，東邊的日本，已經到了連自己還時時提防蘇聯當頭一棒都來不及的境地，當然對蘇聯是根本失去了威脅，目前蘇聯所以能夠暫時離開牠幾年來一貫的所謂「國際反侵略陣綫」的口號，那最大原因，牠不得不歸功於中國的抗戰。</p>
<p>今後短時期內，蘇聯對外政策，最根本最重要的一點，就是對於中國的邦交。在另一些對外政策裏，牠也許呆以踏上錯誤的某一階段，而一發覺了錯誤時，也許可以立謀補救，而萬一被救不了時，牠也許有力量去自食其果；惟有對於中國的邦交，牠絕對不會有什麼錯誤的手段，因為牠知道，萬一一個重大錯誤造下時，那時，不獨是中國的大禍，而同時也是蘇關的大禍！</p>
<p>我閃祗要一歸納三年來蘇聯對於中國的實際帮助，再一三究三年来牠的所有机关刋物的理論和調子，那末，對於這一點，我們應當有十二分的把握。</p>
<p>這兩　來，這裏所知道的消息是：日　駐蘇大使駐英大使，都非常地少躍了起來。而駐蘇大使的唯一任務呢，大槪是想仿照蘇，備，協定的例子，也訂一個互不侵犯條約，以打擊中，蘇，間的邦交；為了這，也在請着德國側面周旋，那交換條件是，萬一成功，日本應允備國到那時再加入對英，法，威脅的　渦，帮助德國達到希特勒時刻夢想着的「結束戰事。」不過，據這裏知道的結果是；毫無效果。</p>
<p>最後寄語國人：我們四萬萬五千人的力量，是足以創造一切奇蹟，同時也啼以覆滅一切敵人的！——日本帝國主義麼？哼，！——我們當前的問題，是團結，組織，　東，　在這一切過程中，我閃應當有十二分的把握，信任我們一切的友邦，而尤其是蘇聯！</p>
<p>的成功，分析到最後，那唯一的希望，應該是社會主義國家的蘇聯吧？」</p>
<p>不然！中國是歡迎　切援助的，連來自侵略集團的法西斯國家的實際助力，也沒有拒絕的必要。談到唯一希望麼？中國不希望任何人，祇希望自己！」——我說。</p>
<p>「可是我堅持『蘇聯是中國成功希望的唯一根據』這一點！」</p>
<p>我就總結着：「你的说法，是说明客觀的國際形勢的一部；我的意見，是從中國本身方面說的。我們的意見之羊，並不發生衝突。」</p>
<p>這一段短短的對話，是我去年冬天在此地一個座談會裏與英國朋友們談話的一段；現在忽然想起來，抄在上面，似乎也還有相當的意思。（九月九日）</p>

<p>自由談說寓言　（下）  趙景深　　歐洲的寓言作家　　世界各國，寓言作家極多。除了我們所熟知的伊索以外，還有幾家也是我們所比較熟悉的：　　德國的萊森（Lessing），鄭振鐸曾譯過他的寓言，名爲「萊森寓言」，收入「文學硏究會叢書」。　　俄國的托爾斯泰（Tolstoi），唐小圃曾譯過他的寓言，收入「托爾斯泰兒童文學類編」。　　法國的拉風歹納（La　Fontaine），張若谷曾譯過他的寓言，連載「小說月報」，未輯集。　　除了以上三家外，恐怕知道的就較少了。　　十八世紀初英國有一個名呌葛愛（John　Gay,　1685.1782）的，也是寓言作家。他是坡普和史維夫特的朋友。他寫過一首詩，嘲諷倫敦街市的危險；還有一本戲＼劇「乞丐的歌劇」（The　Beggar's　Opera）諷刺意大利的歌劇。他的寓言作於一七二七和一七三八，都是韻文。　　十八世紀中葉法國有一個弗勞林（Jean　Pierre　deFlorlan,　1755-1794），是詩人兼寓言作家。一七九二年作寓言，仿拉風歹納體。他是福祿特爾的外甥，盧騷的信徒。並曾創作，效西萬提司　　俄國克里洛夫（Krilof,1768-1844）知者較多，但他也能作美妙的寓言如「猴與眼鏡」，「驢與夜鶯」却很少人知道。他的寓言共九卷，在一八四三年出版，普希金稱他爲通俗詩人，可謂名副其實。　　此外寓言作家尙多，此地都不及一一詳叙了。參考：　　Ernest　Rhys:　anthology　of　the　Fabulists　of　all　countries　　Rhys　davids:　Buddhist　Birth　Stories　　Magnns:　A　dictionary　of　EuropeanLiterature泥沼  丁諦　　歡喜嗎，是焦慮呢？給一種甜蜜的欲望逗引着，駕起貪婪的車，揮動那浮躁的鞭子，禁不住夢想的追求，你歡喜葡萄的甜，迢遠的夢，刀上的血光，殘旗下馬嘶聲的酸楚，那麼可憐的眼睛是永遠不能看淸路上的高低了，糾纏着苦惱的繩素，緊緊地絆牽着心的追求，愚笨的目以爲英武的寳劍爽利地揮斷了平安的蛛絲，他便做了一個從空跌落下的蜘蛛。英勇嗎？是愚笨呢。他忘記了一面平安的網，割斷了，用他自已的手。　　呵，我們在蒸發着太陽的油和汗的六月天，一個蒼蠅接連着一個，牠們以英勇而捷伶的姿勢撲到一張鋪滿糖蜜的紙上，看來多麼可笑。當無知的小動物初嘗着甜蜜的味道時，牠們伸長頸項，脚出狂亂地擺開，一瞬間糖便黏住了牠們的身體。也還有不舒服的，再爬，再翻動身體，移動一點在牠們以爲是逃開一步了。短短的一瞬間啊！甜蜜的冒險的成功，快人心意的一瞬間，身背後原來就緊緊隱伏着苦痛和失敗，一慕驚心怵目的悲慘。你覺得好笑了，在旁邊看見一堆蠕動小小的黑東西，以龐大和明眼人自居的你，會發生一聲憐憫而又是嘲笑的慨歎：「不必歡喜，下面你就得焦慮了。」然而你不必忙着嘲笑。人生也有一面大大的泥沼。　　像一張紙上鋪滿糖蜜，逗得人歡欣，再絆上苦惱的繩索。牠有廣闊，也有深幽，逗着人冒險，歡喜用英雄來證明在妄的勝利。像糖蜜黏牢蒼蠅小脚，你一面覺得成功愈近，一面又一步步離成功愈遠。住過鄕村的人，總有一兩决泥淖的回憶吧。當接連一二十天黃梅雨落成在塘，屋中剝蝕的壞壁近於霉爛時，笠帽濕漉漉，糢糊掩蓋着幾個彎腰在田中的農夫，山濕的，烟濕的，連鳥的歌聲也濕的。偶然有一兩個行人發現在泥濘的田塍上徘徊了，進退都沒有主意。克復過的困難，不能再克服下去了—回頭呢，還是往前進？這小小的田塍，和遼闊的沙漠有什麼分別呢，牠們一樣是陷人的泥沼啊！鋪開一條成功的路，給貪婪的人歡喜，給渺小的人自矜　　只有那黏着身的一瞬，纔有蒼蠅的後悔，怨恨眼饞手脚太快，吃的糖蜜也多。牠會斜睍着絕望憤怒的眼，咒駡那有害的泥沼，塡滿一紙的糖蜜。咒駡那喜愛的，悲悼那成功的，徒然追想幸福的過去。然而這悲慘的命運又眞是最後的最後啊！可悲的是一點朕兆也不露，緊緊隱藏着，甜蜜的痛苦，得意的悲哀。一步步誘人走上幸福的梯，然後再用絕望的繩索絆住你。歡喜逗着你輕率了，駕起貪婪的車，揮動那浮躁的鞭子，再以愚昧的黑紗蒙罩兩眼黏着，黏着，你走得更深更遠……　　沒有什麽顧慮的無窮的天地在鮮紅的刀光下一任自己的翱翔了。　　太陽慢慢落下，找不着一個邊際，人走得更深，更遠，脚黏着的變成了鬆鬆的土坑，一粒芥子置身在須彌中，顯得那麽渺小，孤立和可憐。我不能不想起那小小一幅泥沼上的小小蒼蠅了。那悲哀的黏牢身體的一瞬，黏着人更深，更遠　　逗着你歡喜的「成功」啊！鑄夢  陳述　　生活永遠是移在死呆的痕跡上，每天，每一個時刻，就讓我說厭倦吧！似乎有些像陶淵明想像的那一個桃花源，但就缺了那種靜穆的氣氛；永遠是動蕩着的　麗的畫面，建筑在時代的浮層，衹讓詩人去謳歌吧！再也淌不出一絲心情去欣味，半面的凛風刺骨：還有一支支瞄凖胸膛的冷箭，思想底炸彈……捧着心，投在雜亂的行列裏溜過……　　黃昏，身子平躺在床上時：「我是在這兒呢！」胸口漸漸地緊壓；携着隱痛走入夢鄉：　　——濃密無邊的森林，崚嶒峻峭的嶽巒，澎湃着的洪流，急旋的峽，莊嚴的關，熱血匯合着的一羣，幾萬萬條手，滴不盡的汗，洒不完的血；要生存！要自由！要解放！——　　一意識自己，驀地從夢裏跳醒，子夜的寒風叩着窗，覺得頰上冷冰冰地滑下二顆淚：——……我……是……在……這……裏……呢語文小故事麵包  柷敔　　記得我看了一齣話劇一奇丐」之後，心頭經常地盤旋着那個乞丐喊「麵包」的聲音，喊得那麼悲愴，使生之艱難充分表現出來。生！誰不要生？生是一切的動力。語言也是從生而來的。　　的在紀元前七世紀的時候，埃及有個皇帝呌做薩梅底古斯（Psammetions），做了一個試騐，想證明有一個呌做弗利基亞（Phrygia）的鄰國是最古之國。他有兩個新誕生的嬰孩，就拿他們來做試騐的材料。　　薩梅底古斯把這兩個嬰孩交給一個牧人，關照牧人，除了給他們羊奶與麵包外，不許在他們面前說任何的話。他們三人在一間小屋內生活了二年光景。有一天，牧人推門進去，兩個小孩一齊伸臂衝去，喊着Bekos這一聲音。牧人起先不注意，後來屢屢聽見，便去報吿皇上。皇土親自證明了這件事，並相信弗利基亞比埃及更古，原因是這個Bekos是弗利基亞語裏的「麵包」。　　「麵包！麵包！」人多麽迫切地要求着生啊！又一個試騐　　試騐嬰孩的學語，除了前述薩梅底古斯外，歷史上還有幾位，如史華比亞（Swabian）皇腓得烈二世，蘇格蘭王傑姆斯四世，而最有名的就是印度皇阿克巴爾（Akbar）。　　阿克巴爾生了三十個孩子，這在印度並不十分希罕。他要試騐這回事：他把他們關在一個小屋裏，託許多奶媽領養，當然不許奶媽說話，於是看他們說那個地方的話，阿克巴爾皇就照這地方的制度去治國。試騐的結果有兩種紀載。　　一說數年之後，這三十個孩子說的話一點不淸楚，阿克巴爾皇只得以他自己的制度去治國。另一說這些孩子到後來都變成了啞子。　　這兩種說法都給我們一個敎訓：語言是社會的產物，如果一脫離社會，語言便得解體拉丁語　　拉丁語是中古歐洲的共通語，但終敵不過各民族的勢力，結果盎格魯人與佛蘭克人，雖講拉丁語，彼此不通，寫其字來又通了。我想文言在今日正走到這地步，講文言沒人權，看文言則解。請吳佩孚將軍入武廟  豪　　吳佩孚將軍是「東方文化之特產，中國歷史之完人」，誰都肯承認這句話的。這樣的人物，固然在現在可以爲我們的表率，就是在千秋萬世後，也足以爲將來人的楷模。因此，我主張請吳佩孚將軍入武廟。　　知識程度很高的人，也許要以爲我在提倡迷信。但是我們知道，武廟正和文廟一般，只是紀念與崇拜的所在，並不是愚人向之求福避禍如觀音堂，眞武廟一般的所在。所以如果請吳將軍入武廟，決沒有迷信的嫌疑。　　我並且主張吳將軍應該居武廟的主位，而由關岳配享。關公約人格，當然也足以彪炳千秋，然而「斬顏良誅文醜」，而又「華容道擋曹操」，說起來總有些使人不痛快，前者是助敵，後者是放敵，到底不足爲訓。岳飛的追上關公，與之並享，是應該的。現在的吳將軍，其地位的困難，似乎又比從前的岳飛爲允甚，而給予國家民族積極的援助，也更比岳飛爲允多，他應居岳飛之上，也是應該的吧。岳飛還比不上他，關公比了他，就格外瞠乎遠矣！他居武廟的主位，誰曰不宜！　　在全國哀悼吳將軍的時候，我有這主張，並不是要凑凑熱鬧，聊爲點綴。實在的，默察這兩天來的哀悼文章，都只重在稱頌方面，而忽略了以後怎樣來紀念他，崇拜他，並且使之爲後來人的榜樣。假使有誰不贊同我這個主張，那末我請他提出更完美的主張來。　　其實吳將軍可以作武神而入武廟，還有些小看了他，所以我希望別人的主張，更會比請他入武廟還要偉大些，因爲誰還配稱「東方文化之特產，中國歷史之完人」呢！</p>

<p>㳺藝界	在「中國之鏡子」裏的戲劇家（二）　—梅邊雜憶之七  李斐叔　　我先來介紹這位藝術家罷，他的名字，是呌做「路易氏賴鉭雅」Louis　Laloy法國人、生於一八七五年，現任「馬黎國家劇院」的副院長、兼「巴黎大學」中國文化系敎授。他是一位學者，又是一位「語言家」與「評論家」，不僅是一位「戲劇家」。他所交游的朋友，如「愛因司坦」Einstein「柏格遜」Henri　Berson…等等，皆是知名之士。他在法國的藝術界裏，是很有崇高的地位！因為他對於戲劇與音樂，曾有過很多而很大的供獻。他更著作等身，風行於世界！「中國之鏡子」“Mirror　of　China'一書，是他遊歷中國後所著。一九三六年，在紐約出版。　　「滿洲里之關吏」The　Manstoms　Official　at　Manchuli是該書中的一節。描寫他將由「西比利亞」回國時，經過「滿洲里」邊境，受稅吏檢查時的種種情形。茲將原文譯述於後。賴氏在文尾寥寥幾句感想裏，已充分溢示出梅先生之不可思議的感動力，作者似可無須再　一辭，不過我覺得以一西方學者的眼光，對一在中國認為很平凡的舞臺演員，能有這樣平淡中而却有骨子的描寫，字裏行間，又含有驚奇與敬佩之意！復將歐美的一般演員，用來作為對照，以增强梅先生的可跺與可欽。這在梅先生一生榮譽的基石中，不能不算是値得紀念的一角！雖然他幾次出國，所獲光榮而有價値的名家評語，此外正復不少。　　我的英文程度，太粗淺了，此文之譯述，端賴梅夫人之英語敎師吳女士，及Wellington　K.　Yong先生之助成。附此致謝，我一向對掠他人之美的人，是最為鄙棄的。　　：「昨天晚上九點鐘，在我伸長了我的耳朶；注聽着前面畢竟有沒有什麼動靜之中？火車已很安穩的停在「齊齊哈　」Tsl　Hor的火車站上了。　　「戰事已進展到「嫩江」了！敵方的軍隊快要過河了」！我們此時，已知道這些傳聞，完全是謠言，那鐵橋並沒有炸毀，四外則平靜無事，我們很安穩的在車上睡我們的覺。　　第二天的下午一點鐘，有一隊俄國的伕子，把我們的行李，搬運到稅關上去受檢查。在這邊界「稅關房子」的門上里」三字。至於關上的稅吏及車站的職員，大部分都是亞洲人。新片介紹「珠光寶氣」  企華　　（“Second　Fiddle”）　　宋雅海妮是以溜冰成名的。她在處女作中，除了溜冰之外，幾乎沒有演戲的機會；以後的機部作品，也始終側重在她的溜冰技術上。這部「珠光寶氣」，是給予她較多的演戲機會，但是她的面部表情除了機械的喜怒之外，不能十分展開，譬如她不能自己的愛着羅第范里，和拒絕泰羅鮑華的解釋，她的喜怒憂　，都是機械化的，這缺點是她前途的阻碍。　　相反的，泰羅鮑華在這個戲中充份地發揮了他的演技，宣傳時的興風作浪，和遭遇宋雅海妮拒絕後的頹傷，他的成就在過去任何一個戲之上的。　　導演者處理喜劇的圓熱的的腕，也是値得筄崇的。更可愛的是羅第范里的歌唱和宋雅海妮的溜冰，並不像一般的電影那樣，成了各自的據塲面。譬如羅第范里的第一塲歌唱，是介紹攝影塲風光和他的出塲；第二塲歌唱是勾劃他和宋雅海妮的變愛過程。宋雅海妮的溜冰，也安揷得非常自然。　　溜冰時的攝影，那樣活潑的鏡頭，十分美感。　　至於這個故事，正是好萊塢電影公司本身的寫照，為了宣傳一部新作，和介紹一位新人，他們是不惜出之以任何手段，所以宋雅海妮如能在陷入變愛的漩渦中而不知自拔的時候，能充份地描繪在不合理宣傳之下所受到的痛苦的話，「珠光　並不是一部無　的　。章遏雲　廿日　登台  唯我　　現在出演黃金之王玉　，本定演期為一月，經當局挽留，續約十日，演至十六日打住。　王玉蓉後　之新角章遏雲，內定二十日登台。　　黄金　王玉蓉後登台之京角，名單　已開出，除章遏雲外，計有　生安舒元，小生葉盛蘭，花臉袁世海，丑角艾世菊，　子老生貫盛習，武生張雲溪，武二花張世桐，陣容相當齊　，其中之袁世海艾世菊二人，係前次隨宋德珠來滬，被挽留候章同時登台，而未北返者，葉盛兰贯盛習，今歲在滬表演甚久，皆滬人所熟知，勿庸介紹，惟安舒元張雲溪張世桐三人，則不可不記：　　安舒　工　生，為俊卿之弟子，在梨園中資格頗老，曾與楊小樓雲艶琴來滬，出演天聲舞台（即今之天蟾舞台），天聲演罷北返後，未嘗南來。舒元嗓音響亮，尤長於演做工戲，近年來其戲路極近馬派，溫和之名劇，如「蘇武牧羊」「四進士」「一棒雪」等，舒元皆稱拿手。　　張雲溪為後起武生之傑出人才，嘗一度隨尚小雲來滬出演黃金，其藝頗多可取，頗受顧曲人仕之激賞；今則益見進步，尢以短打戲為最，前數月在東省，獨擋一面，出演甚久，演「白水灘」「四杰村」諸戲，名聞一時。張世桐為其下靶，工武二花，出身富連成，藝較張連廷有過之無不及，摔打翻跌無一不佳，雲溪之良配也。兩張咸皆青春年少，屆時出演必將一現大好身手。王清塵小誌  緒　　名　生王清塵，譽滿南北，蜚聲梨園，唱做得小余之眞傳，一向　游華北各埠，頗得觀衆之讚譽。此番應滬上人士之邀請，毅然南下，已决定於明日出演於天蟾舞豪。打泡於明日出演於天蟾舞裏。打泡戲第一日為「戰太平」，第二日為「空城計」，第三日「打棍出箱」，其中尤以「戰太平」一劇，　昔除老　及小余有時排演外，目下　生中演唱斯劇者，寥若晨星，今王伶於第一日即排演斯劇，當有一番盛况也。"Intermezzo"又是一张怪热烈的戀愛片，故事叙述一個　　家底羅曼史。這　兩具小姑娘，高　的是英格　蓓曼；較小的呌安托，　　六　。她們在本片中演得很不錯。　　　（下圖）李思康　華和英格麗蓓曼的一個頗有時意的鏡頭。（方穆）棋苑  馬仲輝擬　鮑子波編　陸承鑄校　　　第一二四局　雙鳳齊鳴　　　先和　　着法下明披露　　奮身殺敵着法　　砲四進一　象五進七　車三平六　將四平五變車六進三　　車四退六　砲三平五　馬三進五　車一平五　將五平六　　卒二平三　　變將四平五　車一平五　砲五退三　車六平五　將五平六　　卒三平四　　棋訊　華聯同樂會舉辦之「華聯盃」象棋賽業已結束定於十二月十二日晚七時在該會大禮堂給獎，茲將比賽優勝名單列後。　　計開　　團體　隊長　個人　　冠軍聯藝　藝林陳榮棠　聯藝黃金根　　亞軍益友　青華陳廉庸　　殿軍華聯　　精神獎　　雙溪　碰壁　聯藝乙　藝林林　華聯華　華聯聯　　行隊　隊長　個人　　冠軍中儲　先施蔡一飛　卜內門楊存如　　亞軍先施　中儲徐光文　　殿軍上水</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Only Hope for Maintaining People's Livelihood <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Ever since rice prices soared, there was hope that the new harvest would bring them down slightly, but instead, they have continued to rise, reaching a new high of forty-five yuan the other day. At the same time, the price of soybean oil has reached over one hundred and ten yuan per dan, and flour prices have reached eight yuan. The prices of other daily necessities are also rising in the same way. One price increase leads to a hundred, and the actual purchasing power of one yuan of legal tender today is probably less than 35% of what it was before the war. Although Shanghai is known as a prosperous city, the majority of its residents are wage earners who must meet unlimited expenses with limited income. Almost everyone is struggling, and their complaints are frequent. The situation is even worse for the unemployed and displaced people. They have no way to beg for food and no way to make a living. Exposed to the wind and frost, they are driven to take risks. Hunger and cold give rise to thieving hearts, which must be punished by law, but are still deserving of sympathy.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war in Shanghai, rice prices rose from twelve or thirteen yuan to seventeen or eighteen yuan, causing widespread unrest and repeated incidents of rice grabbing. Finally, with the cooperation of various parties, a Rice and Grain Adjustment Committee was organized, and the Shanghai Municipal Council stepped forward to order a large amount of foreign rice, which was successively shipped to Shanghai to provide relief. This stabilized rice prices and benefited the people's livelihood. However, this arrangement collapsed during the lean months of this year. At that time, the Shanghai Municipal Council also tried to impose restrictions, but unscrupulous merchants and hoarders did their best to undermine these efforts, and the Municipal Council was unable to take further action. As a result, once price controls were broken, the situation was like a river overflowing its banks and became impossible to control. In May of this year, this newspaper pointed out that if price controls were necessary, it was important to determine how to implement them effectively; if they were not necessary, it was important to ensure that rice prices were not manipulated and remained stable. We also believed that turbulent times breed speculation, and that in order to minimize speculation in the rice market, open evaluation, centralized buying and selling, and equitable distribution were indispensable. However, these suggestions were ignored by the leading figures of the time, resulting in today's rice market being almost entirely controlled by hoarders and speculators. Now that grain prices have risen to unprecedented levels and the people are extremely uneasy, although condemnations and appeals are frequently heard, they are insufficient to curb the arrogance of unscrupulous merchants because they lack real power to restrain them. If things continue in this way, where will it all end? Therefore, we cannot help but pin our hopes on the Shanghai Municipal Council, which is responsible for protecting the citizens and maintaining public order. We urge the council to uphold its original intention of maintaining the people's livelihood, and to make the same efforts as it did after the outbreak of the war in Shanghai. We urge the council to cooperate with local public organizations, formulate concrete plans, take effective measures, work hard without complaint, overcome personal considerations, and stabilize the people's livelihood, acting as a life raft for millions of citizens.</p>
<p>Some argue that based on the situation in various aspects, stabilizing rice prices is difficult. This is certainly true, but the only real problem is a lack of determination to maintain the people's livelihood. If there is such determination, then the task will become easier. The reason why rice prices in Shanghai are so high is that the supply channels are blocked, allowing hoarders and speculators to take advantage of the situation. Once they have hoarded rice, they will inevitably seek to profit from it, and so they use their financial resources to exaggerate their position, secretly buying and selling to drive up prices, just like bamboo shoots breaking through the ground, rising step by step. There are many reasons for the disruption of supply channels, both internal and external, which cannot be fully explained in a few words. The problem of the people's livelihood is a factual problem. Addressing it by dealing with the facts and formulating appropriate strategies is difficult to do without a deep understanding of the root causes. One still runs the risk of being ridiculed for blindly following conventional methods. It cannot be judged based on conjecture, nor can it be measured by unsound and unrealistic statistics. Exaggerated talk will not have the effect of saving the situation. It is essential to approach the situation with a compassionate heart and develop a plan that addresses the specific symptoms. The most urgent issue to resolve is how to ensure that the supply of food to Shanghai is not hindered. There is no other way to do this than for the Shanghai Municipal Council to consult with the consular corps to make serious representations to the Japanese side, so that in the future, all rice and grain transported from the interior to Shanghai, or any ships or vehicles registered by the Shanghai Municipal Council to transport rice and grain from the interior, will not be hindered or detained in any way. This will replenish Shanghai's food supply and maintain Shanghai's security, and this is the first measure.</p>
<p>Centralize rice and grain trading in one market. Recently, the rice industry has also recognized this and has repeatedly announced its intention to reorganize its business rules. However, the reality is that it has been unable to prevent off-market transactions, and brokers are manipulating the market in a way that is beyond control. The true nature of this situation is not fully known to outsiders, but it cannot be denied that the rice market has lost its power to control the situation. If buying and selling are not centralized, it is easier to manipulate the market and more difficult to supervise it. Therefore, if the rice industry itself lacks the power to implement its business rules, then in times of emergency, the Shanghai Municipal Council should accept the rice industry's request and step in to assist. The council should send personnel to be stationed in the market on a permanent basis to supervise and guide it, preventing any transgressions. This is also the duty of those responsible for maintaining the people's livelihood in the area, and this is the second measure.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to ask whether the manipulation and speculation of rice and grain are carried out by people within the industry or outside of it, since both are almost certainly involved. However, manipulation by those outside the industry cannot be successful without the assistance of those within it. In the current situation of severe hardship, is it humanly possible to use rice and grain, which are indispensable to people's daily lives, as a tool for manipulation and enrichment? The reason why hoarders dare to act so unscrupulously is that they are not warned. If those who are willing to confess are selected and exposed to the public, then hoarders will know to be more cautious and will naturally not dare to manipulate the market excessively. This will ensure that rice arrives every day and meets the needs of the citizens. Even if the quantity is small, it will not lead to today's high rice prices. However, the limited supply is used to satisfy the insatiable demands of hoarders, resulting in a shortfall in the daily food needs of the people. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Council should come forward to conduct a thorough investigation into the names of hoarders, the locations where they are hoarding rice, and the quantities they are hoarding. First, the council should send them letters of warning. If they persist in their wrongdoing, the council can invoke criminal law to prosecute them for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce, which is preferable. Otherwise, the council can impose fines or confiscate the rice they have hoarded to meet the needs of the people's livelihood, and this is the third measure.</p>
<p>However, in order to stabilize rice prices, political power is needed, but power is sometimes constrained by the facts and cannot be fully exerted. This newspaper has argued that the problem is not so much a lack of rice as it is the difficulty of regulating it. This is even more credible in light of the current situation. At that time, a large amount of foreign exchange was already being spent on coarse grains, and there were concerns that spending even more on foreign rice would consume even more foreign exchange. Therefore, we did not strongly advocate buying foreign rice. Now that the new harvest season has arrived, it is still difficult to achieve the effect of regulation, which has further encouraged hoarding. The only option is to order foreign rice to meet market demand, which may seem like drinking poison to quench thirst, but can deter unscrupulous merchants. If this gradually stabilizes rice prices, then speculation will also decrease, and the need for foreign rice will naturally decrease. This will not have a significant impact on foreign exchange. On one hand, major companies and factories should be encouraged to provide their employees with advances to pre-purchase foreign rice, which they can then resell to their employees at cost, alleviating their hardship. On the other hand, the government should organize the sale of rice at affordable prices to meet the needs of the poor, and this is the fourth measure.</p>
<p>These four points only outline the general principles. As for how to manage the people's livelihood, stabilize grain prices, and address the daily necessities of life, measures should be taken based on the facts. These issues are beyond the scope of this article. The people of Shanghai have suffered from the hardships of life for a long time. The Shanghai Municipal Council is the only one who can relieve them of their suffering, and they are hoping for it as much as people hope for rain during a severe drought. We hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will respect public opinion, consider the wishes of the people, and live up to the expectations of millions of citizens. The benefits of good governance will not be limited to the prosperous areas.</p>
<h3 id="e16">The U.S. Recognition of the Soviet Union Becomes a Focal Point of Political Strife: The Republican Party Takes the Severance of Relations with the Soviet Union as its Platform; Finland's Overdue Loan is Placed in the Deferred Payment Account <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Washington – Political figures here recently stated that since the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, pressure has been exerted on the government from all sides to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and rescind recognition (the U.S. recognized the Soviet Union in 1933). This matter has become a subject of debate in domestic politics. Leading figures of the Republican Party, such as former President Hoover and Senator Vandenberg, have repeatedly stated that the Soviet Union has violated its promises and engaged in communist propaganda within the United States. General discourse within the party also suggests that President Roosevelt's actions in recognizing the Soviet Union were a major mistake, and the predicament the U.S. finds itself in regarding the Finnish issue should be the responsibility of President Roosevelt. However, diplomatic figures argue that after the U.S. established relations with the Soviet Union, it could obtain useful intelligence from that country and, when circumstances permitted, contribute to peace efforts. Moreover, the Soviet Union's violation of international law and abuse of force are similar to Germany's, and since the U.S. government treats both Germany and the Soviet Union equally, it would be inappropriate to sever relations with the Soviet Union alone. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington – Observers here are paying close attention to the political problems caused by President Roosevelt's recognition of the Soviet government within the U.S. Republican Senator from Michigan, and Republican presidential candidate for 1940, Vandenberg, yesterday stated that "severing relations with Moscow" is one of the Republican Party's platforms, and the general movement of the U.S. Republican Party is also to recall the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, or sever U.S.-Soviet relations. Observers believe that the Republican Party sees President Roosevelt's recognition of the Soviet Union as the weakest point in the U.S. government's foreign policy. Vandenberg announced that President Roosevelt is personally responsible for the U.S. recognition of the Soviet government and requested an investigation into the "Roosevelt-Litvinov guarantee, which has become a comical translation." The guarantee he referred to was the document exchanged between President Roosevelt and Litvinov when the U.S. recognized the Soviet Union. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt recently instructed Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to place Finland's loan to the U.S., due on December 15, into the deferred payment account. The U.S. President announced this today while hosting a press conference, stating that when Congress reconvenes, he will recommend to Congress that this loan be returned to Finland to benefit the Finnish people. The overdue debts owed to the U.S. may also be handled in this manner. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington – There are widespread rumors that the U.S. government will allow Finland to defer its war debt payments. President Roosevelt made a statement to the press, saying that the Finnish authorities have not made any representations to our country regarding the principal and interest of the Finnish national war debt to the U.S. due on the 15th of this month. However, when the U.S. government receives it, it intends to automatically allocate it as a special fund to aid Finland. The detailed use of this special fund has not yet been determined, and it may be used to aid Finnish refugees fleeing abroad or to directly aid civilians in Finland, both of which are acceptable. In addition, the government will also ask Congress to consider the issue of Finland's war debt in order to assist that country, because I personally do not have the authority to allow Finland to defer its debt.

<p>London – It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu Mamoru, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon to re-engage on the issue of Britain's blockade of German export trade, stating that a batch of German goods had already been ordered by Japan and is currently awaiting shipment to Japan, and this issue should be noted. Afterwards, Shigemitsu also visited Foreign Office official Butler for discussions. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Miyako Shimbun carries the following statement by Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma regarding the British Cabinet order to intercept German exports on neutral ships at sea: "If Japanese ships in Europe suffer any losses, we are determined to take practical action in accordance with international law to deal with this situation. When British Foreign Office Butler replied to our protest, he stated that the British side would do its best to handle German goods being shipped to Japan. Butler's words are probably due to Britain's fear of Japan's determination. Do you want to ask why? Because Britain and France have considerable interests in East Asia, such as Hong Kong and Singapore. If Britain and France clash with Japan, they are like porcelain and are very easily shattered. It is not difficult to imagine the seriousness of the losses they will suffer, and the adjustment of British-Japanese relations, which Britain is currently working hard to achieve, will also be reduced to nothing. Therefore, as far as Japan is concerned, if Britain rigorously implements its Cabinet order, it will lose everything and gain nothing. In short, Japan has a firm determination on this violent act, and I believe that Japan's national strength can make Britain and France reconsider their attitude." Now, when Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma entertained reporters, he was asked about the above-mentioned statement carried by the Miyako Shimbun. Suma replied that last night, because he attended a banquet and returned home late at night, he saw a reporter and a photographer waiting at his residence. The reporter raised many questions about Britain's decision to intercept German goods on neutral ships. He then explained the British Cabinet order to the reporter in detail and expressed the hope that Central France would also consider this matter as important as Japan does. Unexpectedly, the reporter exaggerated his remarks excessively. A reporter asked whether he intended to correct this misunderstanding now. Suma replied that this matter was not serious enough to warrant correction. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Tokyo – Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma claimed that the Japanese government did not regard the concentration of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific as an anti-Japanese threat. He said that when Japanese Foreign Minister Kichisaburo Nomura spoke with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew, Nomura did not mention the concentration of U.S. warships in the Pacific. Grew first explained U.S. public opinion towards Japan and the possibility of implementing a ban on the export of arms and raw materials to Japan. Nomura then explained the Japanese side's views on this. However, Nomura did not mention that the U.S. action was a threat to Japan. Suma claimed when answering reporters' questions that Japan "has not yet approached the United States to negotiate a provisional treaty to replace the 1911 U.S.-Japanese commercial treaty, which has been declared abolished by the United States.

<p>Tokyo – According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Kichisaburo Nomura told cabinet advisors yesterday that from the perspective of the Grew-Nomura meeting held on Monday, the U.S. attitude towards Japan was slightly more constructive than before.

<p>Tokyo – The Miyako Shimbun, in an article on recent U.S.-Japanese talks, stated today: "We take this opportunity to frankly tell the U.S. government and people that the Japanese people, until recently, believed that the Soviet Union and Japan were incompatible and that no one believed that a U.S.-Japanese war was possible. However, recently, Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union has greatly softened, while Japan's attitude towards the U.S. has become tougher. This is because the U.S. abolished the 1911 U.S.-Japanese commercial treaty, demanded a ban on fire and raw material exports to Japan, attempted to interfere in the "New Order in East Asia," and concentrated its fleet in the Pacific to threaten Japan. If the U.S. does not want to fight Japan, then the U.S. must reconsider its attitude towards Japan." (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

This decision by the Department of National Defence is likely intended to speed up the training process. The U.S. and Canada entered into an agreement several years ago allowing Americans to obtain federal commercial airline pilot diplomas. To date, hundreds of Americans have obtained this diploma. However, allowing them to join the Canadian Air Force is a first. From now on, American pilots will be able to fight alongside Canadian Air Force personnel on the European front lines, as they did during the last European war. This relationship is of great importance. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Rome – According to a "Roman People's Daily" dispatch from Helsinki, Soviet troops have launched a large-scale offensive in the Karelian and Ladoga Lake regions. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Finnish troops near Petsamo and Salla are preparing to offer strong resistance to the anticipated Soviet attack. The war in the area is gradually intensifying. The Finnish side acknowledges that the Soviet troops have made some progress. The Soviet side is now sending troops along the road to the front line, but so far, the strength of the reinforcements is not enough to launch a frontal attack on the main Finnish positions. Refugees continue to cross the border into Norway, but no Finnish soldiers have entered Norway. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Recent Soviet communiqués state that the Red Army has penetrated 15 to 29 miles deep into the Karelian Isthmus. From the phenomena observed, it seems that after five days of combat, the Soviet troops have only approached Finland's main Mannerheim Line. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Oslo – According to a dispatch from Kirkenes, near the Finnish-Norwegian border, Soviet warships carrying troops were seen landing on both sides of the port of Petsamo yesterday. The Finns did not stop them and seemed to intend to wait quietly in Petsamo for the Soviet troops to approach before attacking them. It is said that Petsamo has strong defensive fortifications. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Finnish official reports state that after three days of fighting on the Karelian Isthmus, Finnish troops captured 64 Soviet tanks. In one battle, 2,000 Soviet soldiers were killed. In the fierce battle of Salla, Finnish troops captured many prisoners. Out of ten Soviet tanks, eight were destroyed. According to the prisoners, the Soviet authorities told them, "Finland is an aggressor nation, and the Soviet Union only needs five or six days to conquer Finland." In the past few days, the Finnish side has suffered very little loss. Furthermore, according to local naval authorities, Soviet troops have occupied Tytärsaari Island, and Finnish troops have moved to the mainland. There has been no air combat between the two sides, but Finnish aircraft have been conducting reconnaissance flights and bombing enemy troops. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Moscow – According to a dispatch from Brussels today, Soviet naval infantry landed on Hogland Island in the Gulf of Finland yesterday. The landing troops were soldiers from mine-laying ships. Before the landing, Soviet warships bombarded the island first, released smoke screens, and then sent troops ashore. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Finland – Finnish troops have launched an organized offensive against Soviet troops landing by parachute, and as a result, this Soviet attempt has failed. Today, a report was received here that Finnish troops used tanks for the first time and attacked Soviet tanks, destroying ten of them. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Soviet Red Army troops advancing towards northern Finland suddenly changed direction today and advanced towards the Swedish border. Their advance units have reached Kolajaervi, 25 kilometers from the Swedish border. They have suffered heavy losses along the way due to the valiant resistance of Finnish troops, including the loss of four machine guns and two field guns. The mechanized units have also suffered heavy losses, and many soldiers have died. It is also reported that on the Karelian Isthmus, Finnish troops have withdrawn from Suvanto. Soviet Red Army troops are now launching a full-scale attack on Suojaarvi. As for the Ladoga Lake area, Finnish troops have retreated from Salmi and Suulapelli after inflicting damage on the enemy.

<p>Soviet Strategic Objectives: Cutting Off Finnish Troops' Communications</p>
<p>Helsinki – It is reported that the Soviet troops invading Finland are the 7th Army, commanded by General Meretskov, including eleven tank divisions, five of which are concentrated on the Karelian Isthmus and four of which are concentrated north of Lake Ladoga. According to observers, the main objective of the Soviet troops' offensive is to occupy the railway from Kemijärvi to the port of Ofotfjord in the Gulf of Bothnia. This railway also has a branch line to the port of Valaam in the southeast. This would allow them to control the Gulf of Bothnia and Lake Ladoga at the same time. However, so far, although the Soviet troops have crossed the Finnish border by 40 kilometers, they have suffered heavy losses. Swedish sources estimate that the Finnish forces have a total of 400,000 troops, while the Soviet 7th Army has no fewer than 500,000 troops. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Oslo – The Norwegian News Agency has received a message from Kirkenes, northern Finland, stating that three Soviet aircraft flew over the town of Kolosyoki in northern Finland today (a nickel mining company operated by Canadian businessmen is located in the town) and dropped bombs. Local anti-aircraft guns immediately opened fire. The town did not suffer significant damage. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – The weather in northern Finland has now turned clear, and it is generally expected that Soviet aircraft will soon launch a major bombing campaign against Finnish cities. Yesterday, three Soviet aircraft bombed Salla, but they were driven away by Finnish anti-aircraft artillery, so Finnish losses were minimal. At the same time, one Soviet aircraft crashed about 20 miles away, and the fuselage was destroyed. In addition, Soviet aircraft are very active along the Finnish coast, and Soviet aircraft have even been seen in western Finland, near the Finnish-Norwegian border. The nickel-producing area of Finland has also been attacked by Soviet aircraft, but the damage is minimal. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>London – Today is the 22nd anniversary of Finland's independence. Finnish President Kallio delivered a broadcast address, stating that our greatest strength is unity.

The Cabinet and the Parliament held separate meetings yesterday evening to decide on various measures to ensure that various key agencies, especially transportation and food management agencies, continue to work without interruption. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Today is Finland's Independence Day, but Finland is again at war with its age-old enemy, Russia, in order to preserve its independence. Logically, today should be Finland's happiest day, but the city is filled with soldiers in military uniform with serious expressions, and citizens are carrying gas masks, so there is no joyous atmosphere. People generally expect that if the weather turns clear, Soviet aircraft will often bomb the people of Helsinki. Helsinki originally had a population of 300,000, but as a result of large-scale evacuations in the past few days, it now has only 50,000 to 60,000 people. Most of the buildings here have not been bombproofed, but the glass windows have been boarded up and various defensive measures have been taken so that the damage will not spread after being hit. Many areas in the city have been designated as restricted areas, and civilians are not allowed to enter. At the same time, the people who remain here now carry gas masks with them. Most men wear leather boots, breeches, and military-style clothing. Women are still working in shops, hotels, and restaurants, but their numbers have been greatly reduced. It is extremely difficult to evacuate the elderly here. When these people encounter officials who are evacuating, the elderly often say, "I am old, and you are young. You can go, but I would rather stay here." (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Geneva – Well-informed sources here recently stated that when the League of Nations General Assembly convenes on the 12th of this month, the Finnish representatives will read out the proposal made by the former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, at the Disarmament Conference in 1933. According to this proposal, a strict definition of an aggressor is given, namely, any country that engages in one of the following acts shall be regarded as an aggressor: (1) declaring war on another country; (2) invading the territory of another country by force without declaring war; (3) attacking the ships or aircraft of another country by force without declaring war; (4) blockading the coast or ports of another country with warships; (5) any country that harbors armed elements from another country within its borders and supports them in attacking the territory of another country. In addition, the proposal states, "No reason, whether political, economic, military, or otherwise, may be used as an excuse for aggression." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Geneva – The Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to meet on the 9th of this month, and the General Assembly is scheduled to convene on the 12th of this month. League of Nations officials have been speculating on the procedures that the Council and the Assembly may adopt. It is generally believed that the Council, at its first meeting, will formally record the application submitted by the Finnish government and then transfer it to the Assembly for handling. At the Assembly meeting, the Finnish representative will make a statement explaining that the actions taken by Finland are fully justified. Due to the absence of the Soviet representative, it is expected that the Assembly debate will not be too long and will conclude with the passage of a resolution or a proposal. No other actions are expected. Regarding the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations under Article 16 of the Covenant, the Council has the power to do so, but it requires a unanimous vote from all member states, except for the party being condemned, i.e., the Soviet Union. However, Latvia is also a member of the Council this year, and since its military locations are under the control of Soviet troops, it would be difficult for it to vote to condemn the Soviet Union, let alone declare the Soviet Union's expulsion. There are two possible solutions: one is for the Latvian representative to abstain from voting, and the other is for the League of Nations General Assembly to convene before the Council's first meeting to hold elections for the non-permanent members of the Council, so that none of the Baltic Sea countries serve as council members. Only in this way is it possible. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>London – Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that when the Council of the League of Nations meets on the 9th of this month, Britain will be represented by Foreign Secretary Butler as the chief representative. Butler will publicly explain Britain's position on the Finnish conflict, and the application submitted by Finland to the League of Nations was initiated by Finland itself. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>London – Diplomatic circles here recently stated that when the Council of the League of Nations meets on the 9th of this month, the British representative, Foreign Secretary Butler, will deliver a speech expressing sympathy for Finland's plight. Regarding the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations under Article 16, if the other members of the Council agree, Britain will also vote in favor. In 1935, when Italy invaded Abyssinia, the Council did not adopt this approach but only imposed sanctions. At this point, certain important figures in Britain no longer support the idea of sanctions, because Britain and France are now "the number one opponents of aggressors" and are prepared to fight to the end. It would be inappropriate for them to act as "police" for the whole world and engage in hostile actions against another aggressor. However, it would be different if Britain and France were certain that other countries would also join the war. As for Germany, Britain and France would welcome it if they went to war with the Soviet Union. However, the primary task for the Allied powers of Britain and France is to defeat "the number one aggressor." Even if certain parties use the crisis of overthrowing Bolshevism as an argument, it would be difficult to persuade Britain and France to abandon this task. However, if the following three conditions are met: (1) if Germany is also willing to cooperate in action to punish the Soviet Union, and not just condemn it verbally; (2) if Germany and the Soviet Union further threaten the entire Scandinavian Peninsula; (3) if the threat of Germany and the Soviet Union to the Balkans becomes a reality, then Britain and France will undoubtedly reconsider their current attitude.

<h3 id="e27">British Foreign Secretary Reaffirms War Aims: Seeking to Establish a New Order in Europe; Peace and Amity Possible Only When Germany Regains Trust; Soviet Invasion of Finland is a Direct Consequence of German Policy <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>London – In response to the debate in the House of Commons last night regarding Britain's war aims, British Foreign Secretary Halifax explained the necessary principles for a satisfactory and lasting peace. The Foreign Secretary reiterated the declarations made by the government, opposition parties, dominions, and France, stating that, in essence, what we need is: 1. the restoration of freedom to peoples deprived of their independence; 2. to ensure that the people of Europe are no longer in constant fear of German aggression; 3. to safeguard our own freedom and security. It can now be said without a doubt that we do not seek to expand our territory or alter the map for our own benefit. Furthermore, we harbor no intention of revenge. On the contrary, our aim is to establish a settlement that encourages Germany to enjoy its rightful place in Europe, provided that Germany can regain the trust it has destroyed. We wish to create an international order in which the people of all countries can live peacefully under the rule of law, with political and economic life that is stable. We are willing to fully cooperate with others in political and economic reconstruction. We firmly believe that only in this way can we maintain an orderly international life in Europe. I sincerely hope that the sacrifices of this war will enable people to gain a correct understanding of Christian values. As for the practical conditions under which Britain is willing to cease hostilities, His Majesty the King recently stated in his reply to the peace proposals of the Belgian and Dutch monarchs that the King and his government do not wish to see the war prolonged for a single day longer than necessary. French Premier Daladier also stated a few days ago that if there is a government in Germany that can respect its signature, France is willing to negotiate peace with it. France is of the same mind, as is Britain. Some people are now suggesting a truce and the convening of a conference. It should be understood that those who participate in the conference must first learn the lesson that resorting to arms is not a better strategy than in the past. Only then can we expect the conference to achieve any results. Otherwise, it would be futile to merely indulge in ideals. There is no clear evidence that Germany has yet learned this lesson. There are two necessary prerequisites for convening a conference: 1. there must be evidence that the German government is willing to accept conditions that are consistent with our war aims; 2. there must be guarantees that any settlement reached at the conference will be respected. Otherwise, the conference will not be able to achieve anything and will only allow German leaders to deceive their people and perpetuate the belief that the old method of using force has not failed. If that is the case, then the key point of demonstrating the failure of aggression will not have been achieved, and the world will again be in a state of intolerable danger, as it has been in recent years. Aggressive behavior has recently revived. We have already witnessed another inexcusable act: the bombing of undefended towns and the slaughter of innocent women and children, justified by the notion that a country with a population of four million harbors hostile intentions towards a country with a population of eighteen million. The British people are shocked by the Soviet Union's attack and admire the Finnish people's. When the Council of the League of Nations convenes, it will explain its position. In my view, the Soviet Union's attack on Finland is a direct consequence of German policy. Hitler believed that by compromising with the Soviet Union, he could obtain a free hand to attack Poland, and he unscrupulously exchanged the freedom of the people of the Baltic states, which did not belong to him. The consequences of this have shown that once the floodgates are opened, disaster will follow. I believe that the British government's previous decision not to agree to an agreement with the Soviet Union based on the principle of indirect aggression against the Baltic states has now been proven correct by the facts, as this plan was merely a cover for its ultimate plans. I know that the British people would rather face hardship than compromise on such matters and damage the overall honor of the British Empire. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>London – The official announcement of British naval losses in the first three months of the war, compared to the same period in the previous World War, shows that the tonnage lost is slightly more than half of that in 1914, while the number of ships lost is less than half. From August 4 to November 4, 1914, the British Navy lost 22 warships, totaling 125,600 tons, including 5 cruisers and 1 aircraft carrier sunk by torpedoes, 1 battleship and 1 cruiser, and 8 other ships sunk by mines. In addition, 3 cruisers were sunk by German surface warships. From September 3 to December 3 of this year, the British Navy lost 9 warships, totaling 73,886 tons, including 2 older warships, namely the aircraft carrier "Courageous" and the battleship "Royal Oak," sunk by torpedoes, and 4 other ships sunk by mines.

<p>London – First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill today presented a report in the House of Commons on the naval situation in the first three months of the European war. He stated that the enemy's main attacks are now focused on the British Isles and the Royal Navy and maritime commerce upon which the Empire relies. Our country constantly has over two thousand ships sailing at sea. In British ports alone, the number of ships moving daily ranges from one hundred to one hundred and fifty. This vast transportation is being maintained despite constant submarine attacks. We are also frequently under aerial attack, and the enemy is conducting large-scale mine-laying operations to restrict us. Recently, magnetic mines have been placed in the sea by aircraft or submarines, violating maritime warfare regulations agreed upon by Germany and other countries. In addition, the enemy has two so-called pocket battleships and one cruiser causing trouble at sea. However, the British Admiralty is still able to maintain and protect the vast transportation of the world and is engaged in capturing German ships and goods of concern to Germany.

It is only natural that these countries have even more sympathy for Finland's plight.

<p>London – The British King inspected British troops on the French front lines yesterday for eight hours. Everywhere the King went, there were thunderous cheers. The King, along with his brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and General Gort, Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, and more than a dozen others, had lunch together in a simple café in the village of Récourt, which is a gathering place for junior officers. The King's trip took him deep into the front lines, and the last place he inspected the troops was a quarter of a mile from the barbed wire defenses. The King's car returned to headquarters in the twilight. At that time, some French civilians were standing by the roadside, waving to welcome him. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Washington – US Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Major General Embick recently gave a speech here on Pan-American issues. He said, "The American countries have not entered into an agreement to take collective action in military affairs. However, if a strong country invades one of the American republics and seeks to obtain a base in the Western Hemisphere, then the US Army will be prepared to provide assistance, regardless of which country the aggressor belongs to, because if the aggressor achieves its goals, then the American countries will have no security." Rear Admiral Nimitz, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy, followed by speaking out in favor of intensifying the naval training of the American countries, "so that when the linked relations of these countries are threatened by external forces, they can jointly respond to it."

The Ministry of Education believes that normal schools bear the responsibility of guiding local education, and after these measures were promulgated, the provincial education departments have followed them. Therefore, an investigation should be conducted, and in early November, orders were issued to the provincial education departments to investigate the organizations, meetings, and situations of local education administrators guided by the normal schools in their respective provinces and report them in detail for verification, so as to observe the effectiveness of these measures.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute, originally under the Ministry of Health of the Ministry of Interior, was established with the aim of researching national medicinal materials to promote and improve China's inherent culture.

<p>滬市輔幣券缺乏　電財部迅予增發　由市商會銀錢業聯電請求　二批分幣券已定明日發行　工部局亦正研究</p>
<p>Shortage of Subsidiary Currency in Shanghai, Telegram Sent to Ministry of Finance Requesting Prompt Issuance; Joint Telegram from City Chamber of Commerce and Banking Industry; Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes Scheduled for Issuance Tomorrow; Shanghai Municipal Council Also Conducting Research</p>
<p>上海市商·銀行公會·錢業公會·等三　體會商救濟輔幣券缺乏恐慌後、昨已聯電財政部、請即速增發輔幣券、以應需要、中央銀行上海分行、準明日起發行第二批分幣券、第三批委託美商永ning公司承印、又工部局方面、亦密切注意此事、茲錄　情如下、聯電財部卽速增發二批分劵明日發行</p>
<p>After a joint consultation by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, and Money Trade Association to alleviate the panic caused by the shortage of subsidiary currency, a joint telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance yesterday requesting the prompt issuance of more subsidiary currency notes to meet the needs. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank is scheduled to issue the second batch of fractional currency notes starting tomorrow. The third batch has been entrusted to the American company Yongning for printing. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council is also paying close attention to this matter. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>市商會·銀錢業公會、於前日會商救濟上海輔幣券缺乏恐慌、當塲決定由三團體聯名、電請財政部即速增發、以應坱要逐步其原電略云、「本市一角兩角輔幣券、市上奇缺、零找買賣、極感不便、主即速增發、以應需要、該電業已於昨日由三團體蓋章發出、</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Money Trade Associations consulted the day before yesterday to alleviate the panic caused by the shortage of subsidiary currency in Shanghai. It was decided on the spot that the three organizations would jointly send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting prompt issuance to gradually meet the needs. The original telegram roughly stated, "One- and two-cent subsidiary currency notes are extremely scarce in the city, making small transactions very inconvenient. It is requested that they be issued promptly to meet the needs." The telegram was stamped and sent by the three organizations yesterday.</p>
<p>中央銀行上海分行、經總行轉呈財政部核准、續發分幣券五十萬元、業已由美商永ning公司印竣、凖明日起由該分行按市面需要、逐漸發行、各大公司商號以及各業同業公會、均已備函向訪分行申請、該分行因申請總額已逾五十萬元、故決定分別酌量核發、</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, with the approval of the head office forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, will continue to issue 500,000 yuan of fractional currency notes, which have already been printed by the American company Yongning. The bank will gradually issue them starting tomorrow according to market needs. Major companies, firms, and industry associations have all prepared letters to apply to the branch. Because the total amount requested exceeds 500,000 yuan, the branch has decided to allocate the notes proportionally.</p>
<p>代價券已限期收回</p>
<p>Substitute Currency Notes to be Recalled by a Deadline</p>
<p>關於滬市各大公司商號前發之代價券沭市面者、為數頗　、聞財政部以該項代價券、事前未經核准、於　毫无根據、今中央銀行分幣券已發行、一·批五十萬元已定期　發、三批已委託永ning公司續印、以後已能啣接發兌、決無缺乏恐慌之虞、至各行號公司之代價劵、自應限期收回、聞已飭上海市商會輕快地飭各業、限期辦理、</p>
<p>Regarding the substitute currency notes previously issued by major companies and firms in Shanghai, the amount in circulation is quite large. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance believes that these substitute currency notes were not approved in advance and have no basis. Now that the Central Bank's fractional currency notes have been issued, the first batch of 500,000 yuan has been issued on schedule, and three batches have been entrusted to the Yongning Company for continued printing. In the future, issuance and exchange will be able to proceed smoothly, and there is no fear of a shortage panic. As for the substitute currency notes of various firms and companies, they should be recalled by a deadline. It is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been instructed to order various industries to handle the matter by a deadline.</p>
<p>修正輔幣條例通過</p>
<p>Revised Subsidiary Currency Regulations Passed</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、財政部自准中央银行发行分幣券後、前民国一十五年一月　一日公佈之辅幣条例、均繼續有效、並規定偽造輔弊及妨害輔幣信用者、依法懲　、</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng She learned from banking circles yesterday that after the Ministry of Finance approved the Central Bank's issuance of fractional currency notes, the Subsidiary Currency Regulations promulgated on January 1, 1926, remain in effect. It is also stipulated that those who counterfeit subsidiary currency or undermine the credit of subsidiary currency will be punished according to law.</p>
<p>三批已由永ning承印</p>
<p>Third Batch Being Printed by Yongning</p>
<p>第三批分弊裝券、　已由中央銀行港辦事處與永ning公司商妥、訂立承印合同、由永ning公司承印、聞決俟第二批五十萬元發行完竣後、即繼續發行三批、務使啣接不致中斷、關於三批分幣券之總額、聞亦為五十萬元、完全係五分券、因上海市塲　輔幣劵缺乏之後、需要五分劵代替行使正殷、</p>
<p>The third batch of fractional currency notes has been agreed upon by the Hong Kong office of the Central Bank and the Yongning Company, and a printing contract has been signed for Yongning Company to print the notes. It is heard that the third batch will be issued after the second batch of 500,000 yuan has been completely issued to ensure that the issuance continues without interruption. The total amount of the third batch of fractional currency notes is also said to be 500,000 yuan, entirely in five-cent notes, because after the shortage of subsidiary currency notes in the Shanghai market, there is a great need for five-cent notes to be used as a substitute.</p>
<p>工部局正研究考慮</p>
<p>Municipal Council Studying and Considering</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（六日）可靠方面、公共租界工部局對於消除本市輔幣之缺乏、業已加以研究與考慮、但此項問題、困難甚多、而工部局發行特殊輔幣之可能性、甚為渺茫、蓋局方欲僱　在經騐之印刷工人與購買物料、以　輔幣、則將增多支出也、</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that today (the 6th), reliable sources say that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement has already begun studying and considering ways to eliminate the shortage of subsidiary currency in the city. However, this problem is very difficult, and the possibility of the council issuing special subsidiary currency is very slim. This is because if the council wants to hire experienced printing workers and purchase materials to print subsidiary currency, it will increase expenditures.</p>
<p>華方銀行職責所在</p>
<p>Responsibility Lies with Chinese Banks</p>
<p>工部局某員告記者稱、對於此事素無經騐者而擔　此項　務、頗　困難、且發行紙弊、乃中政府之工作、工部局若擔任此項事務、實　破壞主權云、據另一官員聲　、茲可使公衆確信者、工部局對於缺少輔弊、已加注意、但認此事為華方銀行職責之一部份、整個事件、僅係時間問題耳、中國今方遭遇許多困難、此即輔幣缺少、一時不致復原之故云、</p>
<p>A certain official of the Municipal Council told reporters that it is quite difficult for those without experience in this matter to undertake this task, and that issuing paper currency is the job of the Chinese government. If the Municipal Council were to undertake this task, it would undermine sovereignty. According to another official, the public can be assured that the Municipal Council has paid attention to the shortage of subsidiary currency, but recognizes that this matter is part of the responsibility of Chinese banks. The entire incident is only a matter of time. China is currently encountering many difficulties, which is why the shortage of subsidiary currency cannot be restored for the time being.</p>
<p>滬市商會亟應設法</p>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Should Actively Seek Solutions</p>
<p>記者今晨又訪某高級官員、據稱、公衆欲求工部局解決此問題、乃必然之事、但工部局坱要增加若干收入、以應付製造輔弊耗費、此乃不可否認者、一九一四年法國貨幣短缺、結果　商會發行臨時紙幣、問題乃告解決、渠不解公衆何以盼望工部局擔任此微妙任務、熟悉上海　業活動與困難之本市商會、　能以更富經騐之方法、辦理此事、而消除現局之困難也云、</p>
<p>This morning, a reporter visited a senior official, who said that it is inevitable that the public wants the Municipal Council to solve this problem, but it is undeniable that the Municipal Council needs to increase some revenue to cope with the cost of manufacturing subsidiary currency. In 1914, France faced a currency shortage, and the problem was solved when the Chamber of Commerce issued temporary paper currency. He does not understand why the public expects the Municipal Council to undertake this delicate task. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which is familiar with Shanghai's business activities and difficulties, can handle this matter with more experience and eliminate the difficulties of the current situation.</p>
<p>交通機關續發代券</p>
<p>Transportation Agencies Continue to Issue Substitute Coupons</p>
<p>同時本市各處輔弊、仍感欠缺、電車與公共汽車之代價券、亦見缺乏、衆信電車公司不久將續發代價券、公共汽車公司目下所發之代用弊、不久亦將增加、</p>
<p>At the same time, there is still a shortage of subsidiary currency in various parts of the city, and there is also a lack of substitute coupons for trams and buses. It is believed that the tram company will soon issue more substitute coupons, and the substitute currency currently issued by the bus company will also be increased soon.</p>
<p>大通銀行運來法弊</p>
<p>Chase Bank Brings in French Currency</p>
<p>今晨九時盛謠、新輔弊已自香港載塔虎脫總統號輸運來、而於九時市過、即有六箱在海關碼頭起岸、運入大通銀行、但記者向大通銀行探悉、今晨自華南而運來者僅係該銀行不斷接獲之五元與十元法弊、</p>
<p>At 9:00 this morning, there were rumors that new subsidiary currency had been transported from Hong Kong on the President Taft and that at 9:00 AM, six boxes were unloaded at the customs wharf and transported to Chase Bank. However, reporters learned from Chase Bank that what was transported from South China this morning was only the bank's continuous receipt of five- and ten-yuan French currency notes.</p>
<p>又據社聞社消息、美國總統輸船公司之塔虎脫號輪、於昨日上午十時三十分由港抵滬、據悉該輪運有法弊四大箱、計値港弊二十六萬五千元、合國弊二百萬元、該項法弊、係由本埠大通銀行由港裝滬、</p>
<p>According to news from the news agency, the President Taft of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at 10:30 AM yesterday. It is reported that the ship carried four large boxes of French currency notes, valued at 265,000 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to 2 million national currency. The French currency was shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by the local Chase Bank.</p>
<p>當局將抑平米價　籌議法律制裁　已謢法律部商議　特一法院頗重視</p>
<p>Authorities to Suppress Rice Prices, Planning Legal Sanctions; Consulting with the Legal Department; Special First Court Attaches Great Importance</p>
<p>最的近滬市米價日趨　貴、公共租界工部局以問題間接將使社會秩序陷於危境、雖曾聯合米業團體、一再勸告、及設法防止、然迄無成效、工部局當局有　及此、以若無一種嚴萬制裁之方法、決不能使徒知牟利之輩、知所警惕而覺悟、爰飭該局法律部籌覔一適當制裁之辦法、該部奉令後、已由各律師會同商讓、並聞特一法院當局對此亦頗重視、現正與法律部會商採取嚴厲處置之有效方法、</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have been rising, and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement believes that the problem will indirectly endanger social order. Although it has joined forces with rice industry groups, repeatedly advised, and tried to prevent it, it has not been effective. The authorities of the Municipal Council have realized this and believe that without a method of strict sanctions, it will not be possible to make those who only know how to profit aware and awakened. Therefore, the Legal Department of the Council has been ordered to find a suitable method of sanction. After receiving the order, the department has consulted with various lawyers, and it is heard that the authorities of the Special First Court also attach great importance to this and are currently consulting with the Legal Department to take effective methods of severe punishment.</p>

The US Navy also sent a light infantry unit to the scene to escort them. After Colonel Fegen and his wife bid farewell to the well-wishers, they boarded a ferry to the President Taft.</p>

Many of them are making large profits from doing business in Shanghai.</p>

Branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank in various regions of the country have now begun to handle the receipt of these debt donations. The Bank of China is also handling this matter in Hong Kong and overseas. The debt donation campaign has been launched in various places, and the people are motivated by patriotic enthusiasm to support the government in completing the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, and their contributions are enthusiastic. The government deeply appreciates the people's debt donation for relief and will soon promulgate reward measures to encourage it.</p>

<p>據工部局公報載、本市工人生活費指數、自十月份初見回降之後、本月又復上漲、總指數為二五四·五四、較上月份高六·三二點、計增百分之二·五五、貨弊購買力則二十五年度法弊一元、本月値三角九分二厘九毫、分類指數漲落互見、食物各漲百分之四·三六及二·〇五、衣着燃料微降百分之一·〇〇及一·六七〇、</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's gazette, the cost of living index for workers in this city has risen again this month after initially declining in October. The general index is 254.54, 6.32 points higher than last month, an increase of 2.55%. The purchasing power of currency is 39 cents, 2 mills and 9 haos for one yuan of legal tender in the 25th year. The classified indices show mixed trends, with food rising by 4.36% and 2.05%, respectively, and clothing and fuel slightly decreasing by 1.00% and 1.670%.</p>

<p>本月物價趨勢、殊不一致、月初承上月跌勢、頗見下趨、月秒則見上漲、米價及匯率之變動、實為主因、本月之始、米價下傾、　號粳米價在二十六元至　十八元之間、羊秈在二十二元至二十六元間、迨入下旬、產區大量採購出口、投機者操縱囤積、米價劇漲、二號粳米及羊秈均達三十四元左右、匯市初見鬆動、本月六日市價英匯為五便士半、美匯為九·一六六七元、二十五日起、又見緊縮、英匯最低達四便士七五、美匯達七·六八七五元、</p>
<p>Price trends this month are very inconsistent. At the beginning of the month, the downward trend of the previous month continued, but at the end of the month, prices rose. Changes in rice prices and exchange rates are the main reasons. At the beginning of this month, rice prices declined, with No. 2 japonica rice priced between 26 and 18 yuan, and yangxian rice between 22 and 26 yuan. In the last ten days of the month, large-scale purchases were made for export in the producing areas, and speculators manipulated and hoarded, causing rice prices to rise sharply. Both No. 2 japonica rice and yangxian rice reached around 34 yuan. The exchange market initially eased, with the market price of British exchange at five and a half pence and the US exchange at 9.1667 yuan on the 6th of this month. From the 25th, it tightened again, with the British exchange reaching a low of four and three-quarters pence and the US exchange reaching 7.6875 yuan.</p>

<p>Among food items, lard saw the sharpest increase. Fresh meat rose 14.60% compared to last month, preserved meat rose 4.89%, and lard rose 5.31%. The supply of goods decreased sharply, and market prices rose. Soybean oil increased by 14.40% due to a lack of supply and hoarding by speculators. Table salt increased by 7.64% due to increased tax rates. In the clothing category, printed cloth rose, while native cloth and fine cloth fell, offsetting each other, resulting in a stable trend. The weather suddenly turned cold, but the prices of winter goods did not increase. In the fuel category, coal briquettes decreased by 9.45% due to price competition among peers. Firewood and charcoal increased due to supply disruptions. In the miscellaneous category, grass paper rose by 7.45%, yellow wine rose 7.98%, and soap rose 3.08%.

<p>Since the beginning of this month, tax collectors from the puppet municipal government's Finance Bureau, accompanied by armed puppet police, have been forcibly collecting house taxes from Chinese residents living in the areas beyond the boundaries of the International Settlement. Those who do not pay are subjected to threats and intimidation. For several days, the difficulties faced by Chinese residents in the area have been widely reported. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Feili Bo, Director-General and President of the Municipal Council, and asked whether the</p>
<h3 id="e41">Wartime Europe March: Special London Correspondence: How We Understand the Attitude of the Soviet Union <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Di</p>
<p>Originally, the Soviet Union operated on the principle of secret diplomacy. However, after the recent signing of the Soviet-German agreement, various propagandas, rumors, and deliberately fabricated falsehoods have further obscured the true direction of the Soviet Union, leaving everyone in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because Germany fundamentally betrayed Japan, Japan felt that its future was in great danger, which is easily imaginable. Therefore, based on Japanese propaganda organs, all kinds of unfounded fabrications were naturally spread. These fabrications are occasionally seen here, but not often. Judging from the few recent instances, their general purpose, after deduction and analysis, is: using the "reddening" of China as a theme to incite British and American capitalists to stop aiding China and instead help Japan under the guise of "anti-communism." However, in another moment, they say that the Soviet Union "wants to redden" China, intending to alienate the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. But when this narrative shifts again, it becomes that Japan and the Soviet Union have reached an understanding, and Japan can "act freely in the Far East." This time, the intention is very obvious: to incite internal divisions within China. Consequently, it is said that a puppet show, orchestrated by the Japanese military and rogue elements, will take the stage during the opportunity of "internal disputes" in China. The current "Japanese-Soviet understanding" and "internal disputes in China" are simply the "stage setting" for this farcical drama.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to start by saying that the three types of rumors mentioned above are all wild fantasies and nonsense, and have not had any effect here. On the contrary, as a propaganda tactic, they have become a joke, exposing the half-baked nature of the Japanese.</p>
<p>We must acknowledge the facts: Since the signing of the Soviet-German agreement, in these past twenty-plus days, the Soviet Union's diplomatic actions have indeed deviated from their usual course. Even the communist parties of Britain and France find it difficult to trace their origins and future developments. The French Communist Party has suffered an unprecedented major blow, experiencing internal divisions and facing dissolution by the government. In Britain, the government has not taken any special measures, but there are major disputes brewing within the British Communist Party. It is highly likely that the current Secretary-General, Pollitt, will be replaced. Although some writers from a third country and their writings unconditionally support the Soviet Union's actions, a reading of their words reveals their revulsion at the Soviet Union's recent moves and their inner anxieties, which are clearly evident on the page.</p>
<p>However, through all the rumors and shadows, at the deepest level, we can clearly see the trajectory and origins of the Soviet Union's attitude.</p>
<p>First, we must recognize one point: the Soviet Union's recent actions are entirely reactive. In my communication "New Developments in the International Situation," I also mentioned that the Soviet Union's intention is entirely defensive. The Soviet Union's actions in recent days have increasingly clarified its fundamental intentions.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's agreement with Germany, under the current circumstances, objectively helps Germany's use of force against Poland, but in doing so, it also risked two significant dangers. One is the immediate danger: If Germany swiftly defeats Polish forces, Britain and France will find it difficult to defeat Germany and will continue to make concessions, leading to a "peace" agreement, followed by plotting an invasion of the Soviet Union under the banner of "anti-communism." This is a path that many reactionaries in Britain and France are currently advocating. What will happen after "peace" is achieved? At that time, Hitler will have truly reached the golden age of his life, able to play all sides, and using "anti-communism" as a slogan to threaten Britain and France to obtain supplies of raw materials and diplomatic non-interference. Under such circumstances, the dangerous positions of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France would be almost identical. There is also a more fundamental danger: As a famous communist leader said, "Any expansion of fascist forces in any region of the world directly or indirectly threatens the Soviet Union." Since Stalin's dictatorship, the Soviet Union's only central policy has been to use all possible methods and forces to develop, consolidate, and protect this sole socialist state. However, in this world dominated by capitalist imperialism, will the Soviet Union objectively consolidate the internal power and external influence of a reactionary totalitarian regime like Germany? Of course not! Then, does Stalin really believe Hitler's self-serving claims that Germany can be "reddened"? This is an even bigger joke!</p>
<p>The Soviet Union probably estimated that after the signing of the Soviet-German agreement, Poland's attitude towards Germany would suddenly soften, reaching a compromise with Germany, and that Germany would then turn its attention westward, directly towards Britain and France. This, for the Soviet Union, would probably be the ideal possible scenario. However, this possibility has already been completely eliminated due to the expansion of the war. Even at the time of the signing, considering Poland's eagerness to expand outward in recent years, no one dared to say they were completely certain.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a theory circulating here saying that the Soviet Union's intention is to cause a major war between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, and then, when the time is ripe, launch a "world revolution." From a purely theoretical standpoint, this may be justifiable. However, when we connect it to the actual situation, we immediately discover that it is absolutely insufficient to explain this instance of Soviet diplomacy -- as I have said before -- the major premise is that whether Britain, France, Germany, and Italy are willing to engage in a major war is highly questionable, both then and now.</p>
<p>For example, in the past two days, due to the continuous retreat of Polish troops, Germany's arrogance has become very pressing. Thus, for the sake of potential emergencies, the Soviet Union has had to mobilize a large number of troops on its western defense line. If there had been no Soviet-German agreement, why would such a move be necessary? So, it seems that the Soviet Union is creating trouble for itself? And this trouble will only increase going forward. As a result, the Soviet Union's environment of closed-door construction has had to be partially sacrificed. Is it really creating trouble for itself? Absolutely not!</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has taken a major risk and adopted extraordinary diplomatic measures. On the passive side, it is avoiding Chamberlain's descent into an anti-communist crusade. On the active side, it is planning to once and for all build a defensive zone, a buffer zone, against imperialists, stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, by taking matters into its own hands in neighboring countries.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union's international environment from now on will indeed be ten or a hundred times more troublesome and dangerous than before! In this future international situation, what does it rely on?</p>
<p>Its greatest reliance, without a doubt, is its own vast worker-peasant Red Army and economic construction.</p>
<p>Secondly, while the current Soviet authorities do not believe that social revolution can be transplanted from one place to another like flowers and plants, they also deny the possibility of a single country establishing a socialist system in isolation and therefore insist on launching a so-called "world revolution." However, in this world where the struggles between capitalist imperialists are becoming increasingly tense and acute, a utopian and secluded single socialist state paradise can absolutely not exist indefinitely in the real world. Therefore, its second weapon and reliance is the struggle of all the oppressed and the proletariat in the lairs of capitalism.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we cannot help but think that before the Soviet Union had the strength and position in Europe and Asia that it has today, it was indeed under attack by imperialists. But today, Japan in the east is in a state where it is constantly wary of a sudden blow from the Soviet Union, so of course it has fundamentally lost the ability to threaten the Soviet Union. The biggest reason why the Soviet Union is currently able to temporarily depart from its consistent slogan of the so-called "international anti-aggression front" of recent years is that it must give credit to China's resistance war.</p>
<p>In the short term to come, the most fundamental and important aspect of the Soviet Union's foreign policy is its relationship with China. In other foreign policies, it may take a wrong step at some stage, and when it discovers the mistake, it may be able to remedy it, and if it cannot be remedied, it may have the strength to bear the consequences. However, in its relationship with China, it will absolutely not take any wrong steps, because it knows that if a major mistake is made, it will not only be a major disaster for China, but also a major disaster for the Soviet Union!</p>
<p>If we simply summarize the actual assistance the Soviet Union has given to China in the past three years, and then carefully study the theories and tones of all its organizational publications in the past three years, then we should have complete certainty about this point.</p>
<p>In the past two days, the news known here is that the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union and the ambassador to Britain have become very active. The sole task of the ambassador to the Soviet Union is probably to imitate the example of the Soviet-German agreement and also sign a non-aggression treaty in order to undermine the relationship between China and the Soviet Union. To this end, they are also asking Germany to mediate from the sidelines, with the condition that if successful, Japan will promise to then join the vortex threatening Britain and France, helping Germany achieve Hitler's constantly dreamt-of "end to the war." However, according to the results known here, it has had no effect.</p>
<p>Finally, a message to the people of the country: The power of our 450 million people is enough to create all miracles and destroy all enemies! -- Japanese imperialism? Hmph! -- Our current problem is unity, organization, [unclear], in all these processes, we should have complete confidence and trust in all our allies, and especially the Soviet Union!</p>
<p>"To analyze the success of [China's resistance war] to the end, the only hope should be the socialist state of the Soviet Union?"</p>
<p>"No! China welcomes all assistance, and there is no need to reject even practical help from fascist countries in the aggressor group. As for the only hope? China does not hope for anyone, only for itself!" -- I said.</p>
<p>"But I insist on the point that 'the Soviet Union is the only basis for China's hope of success!'"</p>
<p>I concluded: "Your statement explains a part of the objective international situation; my opinion is from the perspective of China itself. There is no conflict between our opinions."</p>
<p>This short dialogue is an excerpt from a conversation I had with British friends at a symposium here last winter. Now I suddenly remember it and transcribe it above, as it seems to still have considerable meaning. (September 9th)</p>

<p>The annual Third "Shen Bao Cup" Sino-American Charity Basketball Game, which has garnered citywide attention, is still co-organized by the Shen Bao, the English-language "China Press" newspaper, and the Shanghai YMCA. It is scheduled for the 19th, 21st, and 22nd of this month (Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays), starting at 7 PM each night at the YMCA basketball court. The competition will follow the precedent of previous years, with a best-of-three series to determine the championship. The Chinese team representatives for this year will be selected by a selection committee appointed by the Shen Bao, and they will be announced soon. This cup has a two-year history. The American team won the first edition, and the Chinese team won it back last year. Although the departure of renowned players Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun to Yunnan has slightly affected the Chinese team's strength, there are still many talented players, and it will not be difficult to assemble a strong team to defend the brilliant silver cup related to international honor. On the American side, having been humiliated in the previous edition, they will surely seek revenge. With a wealth of talent and a dominant position in Shanghai, their return will be formidable. The encounter will be between worthy opponents, and the chances for both sides can be said to be equal. It is expected that three bloody battles will ignite the ball scene again. Tickets are priced at two yuan and one yuan, and the revenue will be divided into three parts: the Shanghai Refugee Association, the International Red Cross, and the YMCA Christmas Poor Children's Party will each receive one part.</p>

<p>In yesterday's YMCA basketball matches, the first act was the Friendship United vs. Mighty White. Mighty White had the same roster as the incarnation of Mighty Gold, including renowned players like Paceka, Bordok, Gosh, and Sakingtol. Thus, Friendship United, feeling constrained by the situation, suffered a big defeat of 27 to 51. The deciding act was Shanghai Youth vs. Little Bears. The Little Bears were led by the two veterans Cartoon and Banat. Shanghai Youth was only behind by five points in the first half (19 to 24). In the second half, due to excessive substitutions, the Little Bears seized the opportunity to attack. Shanghai Youth ultimately lost 29 to 37. In the final act, Dah Sing and Mighty Red, Dah Sing forfeited. The results are as follows: Mighty White defeated Friendship United (Group A) 51 to 27; Little Bears defeated Shanghai Youth (Group A) 37 to 29; Mighty Red defeated Dah Sing (Group A) (forfeit).</p>

<p>(Guilin, 6th) The Provincial Government telegraphed all levels of schools, stating that now that the Japanese are pressing the border, they should remain calm and treat wartime as peacetime. On one hand, they should strive to maintain the continuation of school education in order to maintain the foundation of the country. On the other hand, they should cooperate with the military and political needs of the locality where the school is located, go deep into the people at all times and places, actively propagate, lead the people, and assist the government, ensuring that every household, regardless of age, fully understands the brutal behavior of the Japanese, strictly implements the policy of clearing the fields, and that all materials are not used by the Japanese, so as to achieve military-civilian cooperation, and strive for an even greater victory after the victory of northern Hunan.</p>
