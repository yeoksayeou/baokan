<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國中立與英法及遠東</h3>
<p>英法對德宣戰後，越三日，美國總統羅斯福氏簽署中立宣言，國務卿赫爾氏奉令公布之；同時，實施中立法。中立宣言列十七款，實以國際公法中之中立法與美國之中立法爲之根據；並於國務院之下，設立專司，執行政令；令行司法部，執法以繩。其間最堪注意者，厥爲美國現行中立法嚴禁以軍火接濟交戰國；上屆美國國會中之政治鬭爭以此爲工具，蔚爲美國外交政策之鬭爭焉。的言其關鍵：美國之外交政策，對美洲各國，對遠東問題，幾於全國一致，絕無門戶之見；對歐洲，或主孤立，或主親英；主孤立者，主張維持現行中立法，即嚴禁以軍火接濟任何交戰國；主親英者，不但主張予英國以便利，且謂應予厚助；羅斯福總統允執厥中，主張修正中立法而留運用餘地；此其大較也。</p>
<p>美國於此歐戰爆發之初，遽爾參戰爲不可能且不必要，此外有兩途：其一，立即宣布中立，幷實施中立法，如今日之所措置；更視局勢推移，再行決定應吾召集國會臨時會議，以修正中立法，俾爲歐洲英法諸民治國家對抗侵略之助。其二，暫不宣布中立，一面予任何交戰國以在美購致軍火之便利，一面從容召集國會，利用美英先天之情感，以促中立法修正案之通過，然後宣布中立；蓋按之先例，第一决世界大戰時，故總統威爾遜氏於歐洲開戰後閱百餘日始宣布中立，是謂今决亦不必亟亟宣布中立可也。</p>
<p>今者羅斯福總統不取第二途而毅然決然宣布中立，此其故何歟？謂政治鬭爭之敗徵歟？謂不分皂白，無所好惡於英法與德國之間，袖手旁觀，坐視成敗歟？皆非也。竊以爲美國之遽告中立，除於任何國家對於國際戰事宣告中立之一般理由而外，以吾人內心之所感應，客觀事實之所歸納，則羅斯福總統別有其苦心孤詣；蓋有關國內政治者二，有關英法實際需求者二，有關美國整個國際政策，有待英法深切體認，澈底省悟者一；惟此五端，斯立即宣告中立而不疑。</p>
<p>何以言之？羅斯福總統高瞻遠矚，忠誠正直，備具大政治家之條件。彼於國際演變以及修正中立法，有其灼見眞知；當歐戰未作之時，既爲孤立派所厄於國會，及今戰事爆發，仍得保留其宣告中立之大權，以美國國家與人民在歐戰中之安危爲博注，以驅國會議員之接受中立法修正案；如此操縱其間，窮變求通，一般政家優爲之，而羅斯福總統則崇尙法治神髓，亟國家與人民之所亟，寗緩修正，先行中立；此大政治家之風度，有關政治者一也。孤立派勢較孤，然危言聳聽，亦足影響一部分輿論；是就美國悠久之安危言之，就美國人民對於英國之情感言之，孤立派洵屬偏鋒而非大道；則中立法修正案與其亟亟交議於國會臨時會而與孤立派相搏擊，甯若從容公之人民良知之判斷，以俟輿論之水到渠成；此民主政治之極則，有關政治者又一也。英法之軍備與其他一切力量，可謂源遠而流長，究非暴興之國族所得望其項背；開戰伊始，所蓄猶豐，初不亟亟乎求挹注於美國；是以美國今日宣告中立，禁止軍火出口，並不影響英法之作戰；此關於英法實際需求者一也。况美國中立法之所禁，禁以軍火接濟交戰國也，國之未入戰爭狀態者，購致軍火，爲美國中立法所不禁；英法一體，英國各屬地各自治領隨英國之後，相繼宣告與德國成立戰爭狀態，獨加拿大則不然；加拿大者，大不列顚支柱之一而毘鄰美國；故美國雖實施中立法，而英法仍得假手於加拿大而源源購致美國軍火；此無碍於英法實際需求者，又一也。由此四點，可知美國今日之中立，不但對英法無不利，且與英法仍保持其傳統之接近。雖然，予奪暢滯，猶視權威者運用何似耳；羅斯福總統者，美國權威所寄也；與美國國策相適應者予之暢之，權在總統；與美國國策相牴牾者，奪之滯之，權亦在總統。美國對英法如何，是美國國際政策中之一部分，對遠東如何，是其又一部分；國務卿赫爾氏昨日發表談話云，『美國對遠東局勢，正予以嚴密注視；』同時，又據美國方面消息靈通者稱，『美國依傳統習慣，必當以遠東利益爲重』；更於此際，美國復强化其菲列濱艦隊實力；由此種種，美國之遠東政策灼然可見矣。然則美國今後之所願爲英法謀方便者，不將視英法今後在遠東方面所取態度爲權衡之一種標準乎？一週之前，本報既言之矣：『或以爲英法拉攏日本可以抵銷蘇聯之變卦，其實英法在遠束之行動若與美國國策相牴牾，則拉攏日本亦可以抵銷美國之同情』</p>
<p>之英法兩國，美國之所以繼宣中立之後者，確互關美國整個國際政策，有待英法深切體認，澈底省悟者也。</p>

<p>瑞士國巴塞爾城　瑞士國各報、各登有駐柏林訪員發來消息、俱稱、德國官塲現仍力言戰事範圍、不致擴大、巴塞爾新聞報載稱、「德國官方最近向國內與各中立國輿論所宣傳者、乃謂英法兩國援助波蘭國、並無作戰到底之決心、」德國政府發言人、並根據「德國對於法國無所需索」一項口號、向各中立國報紙訪員發表談話、謂德軍不擬在西錢採取攻勢、對於英國、亦當以還擊爲限云云、揆德國官方之意、深望戰事範圍不致擴大、特軍事行動之普遍化、則勢所不免、行見德國輿論、將大感失望、自可斷言、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　此間一般意見、對於法國似乎並不疾惡、咸以法國所以捲入戰爭、完全係受英國之支配、德外部喉舌「德意志外交政治通訊」宣稱、英德談判之最後一段進展、惜乎未曾通知法國、吾則可知法國對義大利調停亦表接受、一與德國相同、而戰爭責任完全應由英國負之、今日法國地位、雖未受德國威脅、但已被迫凖備進攻德國、該報申明、德國民族願與法國、解其百年世仇、釋嫌修好、但如法國無理由之進攻、則將使兩國間和平延長數百年而無獲得之望、（七日海通電）</p>

<h3>渝各界　注視日軍行動</h3>

<h3>軍事重鎭形勢險要　衡陽在躍進中</h3>
<p>市面繁榮運輸殷繁　粵漢北段業已拆毀</p>
<p>衡陽通訊，衡陽是湘南的一個重鎭，南嶽的衡山，相距這裏祇有幾十里，與廣東的樂昌接壤。抗戰開始以來，它在轟炸下的火烟生長起來。</p>
<p>由這里至長沙的粵漢路北段，都已拆毀了，材料搬到滇緬路那邊去築通國際間的大道。完成不久的湘桂鐵路，就是由這裏做起點，直通至廣西桂林，每天來去的車輛，都擠滿了人，軍需品和糧食，都靠這條大動脈來運輸，它在抗戰的今日，已獻出極大的偉力了。日機對這路曾落下不少他們人民辛苦積來的炸彈，可是中國有天賦的人工，在每一次極大破壞下，不久便把它修復起來，照舊通車了。</p>
<p>第三期的大會戰，不久就快要在這裏展開了，延綿的南岳山，正隱藏著無量數鋼鐵般的鬥士。還有許多峰巒，都已依著山川形勢的險要，築成鋼骨的堡壘，在未來的會戰裏，定會發揚它的堅靱性，演出許多驚天動地的戰績來的。</p>
<p>自漢口·南昌相繼失守後，長沙在日人的砲火威脅下，已推動原有的價值，這裏便取長沙的地位而代了。現在苦戰下的贛鄂前綫，都靠這裏來做支撐點，每天輸到前綫參戰的健兒。源源不斷地開動著。居住衡陽的人，大都很鎭靜，對戰爭沒有半點兒的驚態。市面上熙攘往來，軍人·政工隊·少年團等隨處都可見到他們緊張地工作著，抗戰的吼聲，充滿在每個角落裏，蒼老的衡陽，在抗戰中，長大起來了。</p>
<p>這裏衣食住行四個問題，除了穿的因靠外來比較貴的外，食住行都不見怎樣不便，因內地生活程度較低，不比其他的都市。米，每元國幣可購十斤至十二斤，猪肉五六角國幣一斤，生油亦是五六角一斤，此外菜疏都很便宜。但舶來品及日用品就漲價到不可想像了。至於住，則隨處可找到，旅店雖旺，亦不見和價昂貴。行的方面，除了軍事區域外，亦很便利，有火車，汽車，可搭往各處，入內地的人，以經湘桂路到廣西桂林，然後轉入滇·黔·川等省為最多。此外並有一條湘桂公路，直達桂林，與鐵路一樣的不論晝夜，總有幾十輛汽車飛馳著這條長蛇似的公路上，來來去去。</p>

<h3>飾金改懸四百元</h3>

<h3>美匯縮風狂暴　滙豐掛牌五元八七五　暗市曾到六元一二五</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、九時三十分揭曉、較隔昨英滙掛縮二五、美滙亦改小半元、計英金重達八月二十六日之三辦士二五低價、美匯則打破上月二十六日之六元〇六二五最緊價、竟又創見五兀八七五之空前新貴價、其餘除德滙無市外、亦莫不一致降落、英美滙暗市情况殊形恍惚、上落範圍亦大、均基於市上之謠言、初開即告略軟、日行及有利等扒吸頗力、加以外商因戰事歸國、結滙不少、且因其時盛傳蘇德意日四國有組織同盟之說、致進多出少、一度緊至英金三辦士六八七五、美滙六元一二五、但忽以和平空氣洋溢、一時供過於求、即告轉硬、午後再以港電塞出、曾鬆至三辦士九〇六二五、及六元六二五、惟西商沙遜等即乘機吸進、遂又回緊、收盤價英金爲三辦士八四三七五、美滙爲六元半、至九月份期貨趨勢、亦與現貨同、全天成交、堪稱旺盛、結果較上日英緊一五六二五、美軟二五、</p>

<h3>沙遜乘機吸進</h3>
<p>後市初因香港突來電塞、故市象繼續回硬、計港電賣予滙豐有利等外行現貨英金由三辦士八一二五、長至九〇六二五、並現貨美滙由六元半、硬至六二五、入後沙遜忽來扒吸、故爲狀復趨軟化、計沙遜扒進某行等外行現貨英金三辦士八七五及八四三七五、並現貨美滙六元五六二五及半元、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士八四三七五、美滙六元半、本月份英金三辦士八一二五、美滙六元四三七五、結果比上日現貨與本月英均緊一五六二五、美亦均軟二五、</p>

<h3>外幣起伏不定</h3>
<p>咋日外幣起落極端倐忽、始以電傳德蘇義日新四强軸心、正在組繳中、以致人心更形不安、買氣殊盛、美金一度昂達十五元九角、旋因中日議和之消息復囂塵上、故而突然回落至十四元五六角、卒爲十五允、比上日軋升四角半、英金鎊卒升一元、美金元昂三元、價爲九十八元、英票高一元五角、香港票大一角、日金票漲風擴大、價漲五分左右、朝鮮票升二分七厘、惟法郎票尙小一分、安南票降一角、其餘仍無交易、</p>
<h3>證券　內債行市　升降倐忽　洋股活潑</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日因謠言繁輿、升降頗鉅、趨勢完全受歐洲消息所左右、然消息傳來往往不旋踵而自反其道、投機者忽多忽空、疲於奔命、大別之、上午消息惡劣、現金大漲、公債叉軟、午後忽又有良好傳言、市價轉高、收市後忽又開德蘇義日四國同盟之傳說、並又有和平空氣、做多者另有見解、又起買風、丙種會抬高至四十四元二角之鉅、旋又下跌數角、人心紊亂已極、暫時尙不易趨入正軌也、昨日情形、上午鼎康續有出籠、鴻康亦傾向賣出、買戶祗散戶稍形熱閙、午收略小二·四角、午後二十五號五十六號及散戶買進較多、鴻康續有賣出聯益亦有出脫、但轉好五角至八角、全日結果、好起二角至五角、成交總數共計八十萬元左右、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大生第三廠一百股、價爲十五元、　衆業公所股市報告云、交易仍甚敏活、橡皮股允感興趣、雖視數日來生橡皮之剷漲、與外匯之鬆軟、其感應已覺遲緩、然潛勢之堅、迄未稍衰、各股價格、雖多上漲、交易範圍、則殊狹隘、有數種較之晨間高價、且有部份回落者、即此大可目爲康健微象、蓋市况進趨、而爲有秩序之平穏移動、較之激急在暴者、實勝一籌、實業股亦告上趨、午後因下週新交易開始、價格倍形堅挺、怡和紗廠股仍佔顯著地位、成交二萬七千股、</p>
<p>紐約股票、六日紐約電、拿日股市、參差略降、市價分析家之道瓊斯實業股指數近暴漲百分之十八、故反動爲應有之常態、不足爲奇、價格之退落、頗有秩序、有時抵抗甚力、且回小時成交减少、故投機家頗感欣慰、鋼鐵股領導下降、但一部份之損失在收盤前恢復、本週鋼廠工作率因勞工節假期而下降、下週預測將增至百分之六十五、同時市塲亦注意外國需要、出口增加及物價上升等、道瓊斯各股指數均未收到、</p>
<h3>糧食平糶洋米抵埠　米市塲充滿賣氣　粳秈突落二三元</h3>
<p>杜米昨因平糶洋米、業已抵埠、市塲人心頓懈、故自早市開手形勢即疲、不過初開價格若高粳仍欲三十八元、河下早晚三十四元、新尖三十元、惟後因本街大都觀望、市面節節下游、收盤粳尖悉降落二三元不等、若高錫粳三十六元、蘇同粳三十五元、河下早晚稻三十二元三角至三十二元、原包三十四兀半至三十三元八角、嘉善嘉興新川尖二十七元、羊團尖二十九元至二十八元、陳决蕪尖二十六元、新尖二十七元、江北新尖二十八元至二十七元半、統計成交不過四五千包、各路來源、河下仍無到、車輪包子，到三千餘包而已、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日到源仍湧、車輪兩路運到五千多包、允以江北新秈等到數較旺、尙有源源續到可能、且一萬八千包之西貢米亦已抵埠、人心與市價一致趨落、市塲滿佈賣氣、並有甩價以求速脫、因此新秈售價突落二元許、陳秈亦小元半、但價小後引起本街與四郊之店鋪問津、內地帮亦稍辦裝、後市交易轉活、行情亦略爲回定、</p>
<h3>北銷忽動　麵粉廠盤　驟漲二角　小麥暗緊</h3>
<p>麪粉　昨日現粉廠盤、驟漲二角、已達六元六角之現鈔、蓋由於華北客銷忽動、北洋帮以天津水災、需要下脚粉甚殷、曾開出阜豐白袋粉四元半（現鈔）、紅劉海粉五元四角（現鈔）、及二號粉等成交的近十萬包、本街進胃亦較前日爲增、人心向上、市面激升、聞回籠貨棧單目下在市流通者、亦不過三五萬包、各廠售開之貨、均須現出、故回籠粉價隨市而昂、比廠盤仍高角許云、</p>
<p>小麥　亦見好轉、常錫京鎭來源、堪稱聯蟬、各廠進胃、亦不寂寞、又聞粉市客銷活動、廠盤已加二角、囤戶亦收買不絕、惟吃盤有限、市面不易過好、結果暗緊而已、統市囤戶辦去十餘車、及福新阜豐兩廠合辦七千五六百包、最高價爲十光〇八分决至九元二角、</p>
<h3>紗花　海防運輸暫停　紗市欲漲又阻</h3>
<p>紗市始繼平、趨勢稍見和緩、實綠二日以來狂升之價、已屬鉅大、引起一部份獲利者乘機出籠、因之市盤轉起平靜、但一般在匯票上發財者、重整旗鼓、復來收羅、情况頓見緊張、故市價時仆時起、益呈飄忽之狀、目前紗市就外棉情形當然上升、但各路運輸船隻奇缺、客帮辦好之貨、無法裝出、且海防唯一內地交通總樞紐航綫、業已全部停頓、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因上日漲力已暴、形勢和平、少頃某記大戶重來、在市吸收、並聞黑市外匯再縮、黃金昂騰、買風立刻在起、二十支雙馬現貨由六百七十五元漲至七百元、棧單價爲六百三十五元、漲至六百四十八元、迨至收出、獲利者出檔、又復回挫十五元、查半日成交統計一千五百五十包、行情二十支雙馬漲五元、牧羊漲五元、天女反跌三元、雙地球跌七元、今日有棉紗六十五件運烟台、茲將各帮買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>午後後消息、外匯黑市稍長、證券回漲、予紗市反見不利、氣勢轉平、</p>
<h3>外棉飛漲聲中　中外棉交易　非常活躍</h3>
<p>現棉交易、大爲發展、蓋以海外棉價一致飛騰、加之外匯允縮、以致同業人心堅挺、成交紛繁、至於紗廠方面、日商進意爲濃、因其存棉不充、而日紗市價亦昂、所以時時補購、印棉售價再漲六元、茲據業中人言、華廠申新二九廠、鴻章·新裕·安達等廠、儲藏充盈、暫無亟亟購辦之舉、新通花近日來源稍滯、售價日見上升、到四百五十包、開價爲一百十元、昨又到一百五十六包、開價爲一百十五·六元、成交二三百包、北沙昨來新花六十包、久遠朱聞之外棉平果爾十支粗紗原料、成交二百五十件、價爲一百〇八元二角半、茲將現棉售開之盤錄左、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨日已轉活躍、除日廠早已大量收購外、同業中亦向各方搜購、因之售價殊爲堅昂、巴西棉售價一百八十餘兀、四十二支之美棉、索價竟高至一百二十餘元、而賣方尙不願脫手、因之各方預測、如各方政局並無變動、則棉價一致看高也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市電報昨日未到、惟據私人電報云、昨日因人心奇堅、股票市價上騰、棉市因之頗形活躍、開盤即漲十餘磅音、後因投機者之猛烈購買、棉價始終殊爲堅定、結果收盤價、較之上日漲起二十五磅音、利物浦棉市平平、印度連日猛漲、昨日已趨平穏、連同預測漲一羅比、埃及漲二十餘磅音、</p>
<h3>疋頭　染費行將加價　白貨交易大旺</h3>
<p>昨市勢仍佳、溫州帮日內有專輪試航、需胃突盛、本街色布號、以染廠染費價目又將大增、東疋升漲甚速、國布比較尙廉、故連日吸胃續濃、俾得趕早發染、儲貨待銷、故售盤又一致提漲、白貨細布·粗布漲每疋一角至一角半、色布·色斜漲每疋二角至五角、本街成交粗細布·細斜·色布·色斜·嗶嘰·絨布·二百餘件、溫州帮辦怡和等廠粗布及色布·色斜等貨一百數件、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>晨市漲風續厲、十二磅龍頭細布高盤每疋喊十九元五角、同業向洋行開貨亦盛、細布。細斜的計千件左右、五幅細布行盤訂出十七元五角、上海彩球十九元三角半、飛魚細布十九元、五福細斜十七元二角半、俱較現市爲昂、下午因各方謠言蠭起、人心虛軟、市盤回降、龍頭細布做開十九元、但細斜以染色坯子需要仍旺、與隔昨比例、每疋猶升二角半、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>疋頭八日運烟台一百九十五件、運天津三件、</p>

<p>太古各輪塗沒船名</p>

<p>進出船期　不先公吿</p>
<p>該公司昨又特別措置、自今日起、每日所發之船期進出口單、一律取銷、對於進出口船隻日期、完全嚴守秘密、此舉雖可避免敵人之注意、然對營業上、因客家擬報裝貨物、及旅客購票、不能預先知悉船期、許多不便、恐受相當之影響、該公司之太原輪、原定明晨由滬開往香港海防、現悉該輪十日始可到滬、今已改於十二日晨出口、仍赴港防、前聞海防當局、奉法政庇之令、禁止貨物進口事、惟航業界尙無是項消息、究竟如何、尙須待證、</p>

<h3>英法駐軍不致撤退　租界安靜如恒　傳日方提出新要求</h3>
<p>日本政府曾於五日向駐東京之英法波德四國外交代表、要求撤退四國在華軍隊、以免發生意外、而前日駐滬日總領事三浦義秋復分訪英法德三國領事、口頭耍求各該交戰國、審愼考慮、避免在華發生不幸事件、外交界僉認此二舉、係</p>

<p>中國境內</p>
<p>並無德國駐軍、且兩租界局勢、目前並不緊張、僉認英法車隊、事實上無須撤退，故日方對英國領事所提口頭耍求、似無答復之必要、又訊、昨日外間</p>
<p>盛傳日方</p>

<p>服現役之法僑致詞、謂彼等均切欲前往、爲國宜勞、當局刻正作最迅速而妥善之運送佈置、戈大使對於留滬法僑、則請彼等委身於命運、但須憶彼等服從命令、即能對國家作最佳之服務矣、</p>

<p>自歐戰爆發後、一般旅滬甬籍人士、對於該綫德籍航輪是否照常行駛一節、頗爲關切、大光社記者昨特向禮和洋行船務部謀福輪營業處探詢、據稱該輪並未奉到德總領事館關於禁航之任何命令、其久駐鎮海口外之故、則因須俟先到之船、挨次卸裝、頃接電告、該輪方於五日開始起卸進口貨、迄今尙未告竣、待卸盡後、再裝出口貨、最速須至十日方能竣事、故預定十一日離鎮返滬、此後仍當照舊往返、至海福輪上决開甬、猶在謀福之後數日、故其返滬自亦較後、查其班期之延長、實因甬當局限制航輪停泊錨地之故、英意各輪無不如是、又悉德商遠東公司之哈納輪、亦定十五日返滬、照常航行、</p>

<h3>發洋財的機會？</h3>
<p>— （柳星火）</p>
<p>今非昔比購買力已較前薄弱　維持土著鞏固戰時經濟基礎</p>
<p>便是：「發洋財的機會來啦！」是的，在第一决世界大戰中，上海的商業在畸形發展下，的確使少數商人獲得厚利，平添了一份很驚人的家產；且不管這些家產獲得的手段是正當抑是卑鄙？而他們的子孫藉以作威作福，也確曾使別人看得很眼紅。於是，僥悻的心理便這樣養成了。許多人認爲「勤勞不能起家」，幻想着第二决「發洋財」的機會到來。</p>
<p>這次歐戰的爆發，在商人們看來是以爲可以實現他們的幻想了。所以，這幾天他們都在大量吸進洋貨。致使外滙頓感求過於供，英金磅入四辦士，美滙已進七元關。將來「洋財」是否穏穏可發還不能說，至少目前已因爲他們大量吸進洋貨而使上海金融暫時陷入混亂的局面中了。</p>
<p>「洋財能不能夠發？」適當然得看商人的手段高低強弱。但，單憑商人的主觀力量，實際上還不能確具把握。主要的決定力量還是在於客觀形勢的演變。</p>
<p>就目前的情形來說，這决歐戰與上次大戰形同而實非，整個形勢已大非昔比，歐洲的參戰國既較前爲狹窄，而遠東復有中日之戰，前者說明洋貨還有部份運滬的可能，後者顯示中國人民的購買力已較前决歐戰時爲薄弱。由這兩點來展望，獲利也許會有的，「發洋財」則未必有把握。</p>
<p>撇開國際大事不談。單說上海，近年來工業的發達，也非一九一四年的幼稚情形可比，許多洋貨已由國貨取而代之。自然，國貨的外貌也許不如洋貨，而價格低廉，却適合了多數的資產階級以下的需耍。雖然，中國工業的原料多半還耍仰給於海外，但在無可奈何時，退一步「土著化二點，恐怕還是能够維持下去的。</p>
<p>就是爲了鞏固抗戰時期的經濟基礎，大量販買洋貨使資金外流，以及抬高物價擾亂市面，都非於國家有利的。相反，能於此時此地統盤籌劃一下新的國貨工業計劃，一方面供給上海的需要，一方面儘量維持土著貨的輸出，纔能使戰時經濟基礎更加强而不能動摇。目光遠大的商人，一定可以明瞭「高價」的「洋貨」在上海不能廣大推行。大戰時間越長，人們的經濟越感到拮据，「高價」的「洋貨」也越沒有銷路。而廉價的土著的國貨也越受人們的歡迎。所以，不論以國家利益爲前提，或以個人利益爲前提，確立大戰時期的土著工業基礎，實在是商人們在目前最正當最有把握的路子。然而必需記住的，雖說與其「發洋財」還不如「發國（貨）財」，但「商業道德」一樣需要維護；如果以推行「國貨」為名，以「趁火打刦」為實，那麼「發國（貨）財」與「發國難財」，其惡劣程度是不相上下的。</p>
<h3>魏樂唐先生畫扇</h3>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>半夜風流</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>”Midnight”</p>
<p>「半夜風流」是一支標準好萊塢喜劇。</p>
<p>不過，在這荒唐的故事中，正暴露了所謂上流社會中的醜態。好萊塢的劇作家是時常在創造各種花色的故事來取悅於紳士淑女，但在色情與銅臭所包圍着的環境中，他們所能拾取的題材，也正是紳士淑女們自己的事。所以，當轟笑着銀慕上的人物時，或許正笑着自己的影子呢！即如這齣「半夜風流」，一個到了巴黎後，囊中空無所有的歌女，忽然穿著了高貴的禮服，出入於高樓大厦之間，而且有漂亮的年靑紳士追逐着。而一位年老的富翁，在無法禁止他的年輕的妻子有外遇時，就利用這歌女來掩飾不可外揚的家醜……這一切，經過了劇作家的寫作技巧，編成了一偭喜劇，但誰能吾認這不是暴露資本主義社會的醜態呢？</p>
<p>克勞黛考爾白確是個優秀的演員，一個多樣性的演員。這里她的歌女伊芙，演來非常得體。如她以當票冒充請柬，混入音樂會以後，當侍者告訴主人有一個陌生的賓客時，她的微露窘態，但立即左顧右盼，佯裝也在注意那個賓客的樣子；在大飯店中一覺醒來，追憶昨宵奇遇，叉目睹眼前奇蹟，她的驚喜交集，都演得可愛之至。</p>
<p>導演者的生動，圓熟的手腕，更使這支喜劇充滿了詼諧，奇趣的情調，舉幾個例子如下：在音樂會中，他勾劃了各式人物的姿態，而在克勞黛考爾白，的翰巴里摩亞，曼麗愛斯脫及佛萊雷斯里特之間的關係，寫得細膩週到之至。在別墅中，曼麗愛斯脫發現了克勞黛考爾白的秘密，擬當衆宣佈，唐亞曼契來了，在這複雜的關係中間，導演者把每個關係人物的心理狀態，每一個鏡頭都使觀眾作會心的微笑。</p>
<p>最後的約翰巴里摩亞打電話，及法庭上的戲太胡鬧，不過上面舉的例子，還是値得年靑的導演們學習的——是學習技巧，而不是內容。</p>
<p>唐亞曼契戲不多。曼麗愛斯脫嫵媚可愛，頗像個賢淑的妻子，而不是有外遇的蕩婦。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　海外豓聞忽迎桃葉　火中奇景竟粲蓮花</p>
<p>何儷玉道：『這個我正要告訴你，我們接到父親打來的電報，星期一有位父執到上海來，要我們去見他。他也是發起織綢廠的股東之一，曾經開過絲織物廠的，有許多事耍與他去商量。那末我們下星期日到自由村，也是去不成功了。現在你說下星期日是金澹雲的結婚日子，那末本已的定了到那日一定去吃她喜酒的，愛人姊目然也要去的了，我們可以聯袂偕行了。』朱愛人道：『是的。我雖然醫院裏不大能走開，既然答應了她，當然也要去的。好在是個星期日，還不妨碍我的事。到那天倒有許多老朋友，老同學，籍此可以見面。因爲澹雲是廣交游，而且爲人也和氣，所以那天去吃喜酒的人，一定很多。我們就是商量，還楚星期日早上去，還是星期六晚上去，澹雲的意思，要我們星期六晚上去，不知你們兩位意思怎樣？』何雙玉道：『我們是隨便。我們不是本來閑着嗎？你說星期六晚匕去，我們就是星期六晚上去好了。不過我們既然星期日不到自由村去，我們得打個電話給公公，關照他一聲。也許媽媽以爲我們要去，她老人家很忙的爲我們預備午餐咧。還有我們租地造廠的事，不知曾否提出於村議會，通過了沒有？這也是我們很關懷的。」朱愛人笑道：『你放心吧！我們不去，我自會打電話通知他們的。至於你們的租地建廠，一定可以通過，你們儘管放心。將來這個自由村，我看工廠一定發達，大概僅限於輕工業而已。他們說：只限於設立十個工廠，現在却是這樣計算，將來還是一個問題。我的宗旨，和我們老阿爹略有不同。他以爲這裏是個農村，將來也還是一個農村，只要在農事上極力改良就是了。種田人不失種田人的本來面目，還可以保持農村中敦厚樸儉之風。不過我看中國逐漸進步，勢必從農業社會演變到工業社會，至少在沿海省份，必然是如此。農業進展到內地，我們的內地，有許多地方，是赤地千里。這並非那些地方，都是荒到瘠不毛之地，只是一向沒有開發罷了。現在的趨勢，大家都到內地及邊地去開墾，而在這交通便利之區，便振興吾們的工業。』（一七九）</p>

<h3>伶人的思想問題</h3>
<p>— 外人</p>
<p>關於這問題，似乎從未有人論及過，也沒有人去注意它。但是這問題我以爲較「戲德」，伶人的技藝上的修養還來得重要。伶人的地位在以前是很被社會輕視的，以爲這班人總是沒出息的東西，後來時代社會不同了，復經幾個有志氣的伶人覺悟過來，努力一番以後，才漸漸取到了他們底地位。</p>
<p>一般人歌頌伶人，除了藝術以外，總是說他戲德怎樣好，如何有見義勇爲的精神，絕少說這個伶人富有民族思想，國家觀念的。於是養成了一種個人英雄主義，只曉得自己的本身如何潔好，而忽略了自己對於整個的民族與國家，有所破壞與妨害。所以，我可說一般的伶人對於民族思想非常缺乏，有了名利的誘導以後，對於何論那種性質的工作都肯去做。雖然，也有例外的，但還是絕對少數。</p>
<p>前次坤伶趙嘯瀾在南京獻媚，又秘密在上海播音，本報也刋戰和攻擊過。然而在東三省「僞滿」成立的時候，同樣有許多名伶，前去參加「慶祝」，「冀東」的大堂會，也有許多比趙伶還要有知識還要紅的伶人，「盛大」的去參加。那種現象是看出一般有名利觀念的伶人，他們腦中沒有民族，國家，只爲了個人的幸福。</p>
<p>當然，像潘月樵等的愛國熱誠，在上海還能看到。前决　　劇團與　舞臺同人，去慰勞孤軍是很好的例子。回想從前上海未淪陷時，爲了勸購救國公債在電臺播音，那種熱烈的情形，果然値得贊美的，但是我以爲這是小得無可再小的表示，也是每個國民應有的義務。</p>
<p>伶人的沒有思想，一半是環境關係，環境的威逼利誘還使你走上出賣良心的路。改善環境是不能空口說白話成功的，所以在目前的環境最要緊的就是自身的檢點，力避惡劣的引誘，不要爲了生活而出賣人格，能盡多少力，就想法盡多少力，假使環境脅迫你走上末路時，那麼唯一的辦法，就是脫離這黑暗的環境。</p>
<p>還有一點就是沒有人糾正。捧的人只是關於藝的一方面，有學問的人只是指正你藝術上的錯誤，絕對不干涉私生活與你的思想，加上伶人絕少受過高等敎育，於是養成了他們自私自利，注重名利的心。所以我希望伶人在空餘時間，除了藝術上的修養外，還想法豐富自己的知識，這工作要靠別人的援助與指示。</p>
<p>除了伶人有了思想以外，附帶一個工作要做的，就是多演有意義的戲，（自然，這裏有思想和行動的因果關係。）明末遺恨，梁紅玉及南界關等都涉及忠心報國的。其他老戲也能多演戰蒲關，寗武關一類的戲。</p>
<p>不久以前歐陽予倩在滬替中華劇團創作的改良平良，一大半是關於愛國的。我們慢講改良平劇的成續如何，對於採取有意義的題村的劇戲上演却總以爲可以贊美的。無疑地，伶人除了本身有了民族思想，還要想法去感化覜衆，使他們看戲以外，還有一點收獲，能提醒觀衆，不使他們沉醉在歌舞昇平的環境中。</p>
<p>伶界的兄弟姐妹們，請自身檢點一下吧！</p>

<h3>最早的灘簧</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>在本刋上接連看到天虛我生的安康雅集小序和澹然的安康別解，頗感興趣。我對此道，無甚硏究，僅知小說月報號外中國文學硏究上有一篇徐傳霖（即開豆腐店的李阿毛）的中國民衆文藝一斑——灘簧，」另外人間世上有中央研究院李家瑞的一篇灘簧，他們倆把灘簧的起源，分類，演變等等，都已說得很詳細，無須我來辭費了。</p>
<p>天虛我生一文的價値在於說明杭州安康與蘇灘絃索主音高低相差一字，因爲他是精於音律的。至於說到灘簧的起源，遠溯於宋末文天祥，甚至說到晋代竹林七賢，我以爲這是說得太遠了。文文山全集指南錄卷之三固如所云，每言均七絕，前而均有紀事說明，但並不全部如此，其中就有一首極長的五古「高沙道中」，並且自「貴鄉」一詩後，又都是五言，甚至大部分沒有本事說明。認灘簧爲台黃，只是爲了文天祥的一首過黃巖序云：「予至淮，即變姓名。及天台境，哲齋張爲予覓綠漪詩。予既賦，題云淸江劉洙書。此過黃巖，寄二十字。」我也以爲這只是揣測之詞。</p>
<p>大約灘簧是爲了崑曲難懂，才改唱句而不改說白的。崑曲所歌也有淸代的作品。如徐傳霖所舉灘簧所唱的斷橋合鉢諸戲，便都是從雷峯塔傳奇改變的。道傳奇最早的作者是雍正時人黃圖秘，由此可知灘簧當發生於雍正以後，即乾隆時代也。</p>
<p>我新近所看到的較早的灘簧的紀錄有兩條：</p>
<p>（一）乾隆間沈起　的文星榜傳奇第四齣科諢道士云：「唱灘王是我起首。」又云「賣橄欖粗話直噴，打齋飯嚼蛆一泡。」按賣橄欖和打齋飯都是「後灘」出名的戲，想不到在乾隆年間就已經有這些戲了。</p>
<p>（二）乾隆三十九年綴白裘同集（即今本綴白裘十一集卷三）算命齣中有云：「慢點，還要饒一隻灘頭來」。</p>
<p>連道士和算命人也要唱灘簧，可見當時灘簧的普滬。</p>
<p>在沒有找到比乾隆史早的關於灘簧記載以前，我保留我的灘簧起於乾隆年間說。</p>

<h3>French Vanguard Troops Enter German Territory; German Offensive on the Northern Route of Poland Thwarted; Main Forces of Both Armies Engaged in Fierce Battle on the Southern Route; German Army Finds It Difficult to Breach Warsaw's Outer Defenses</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The Army General Staff has just released War Bulletin No. 6, stating that fierce battles are currently taking place in Łódź, Piotrków Trybunalski, Tomaszów Mazowiecki, and the area west of Tarnów. On the northern front along the Toruń-Sierpc-Płońsk line, the enemy has made no progress. In the Gdynia port area, our forces are fiercely battling the German troops from Danzig. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: It is reported that German troops have advanced to within thirty miles north of Warsaw, but Polish forces have already destroyed the bridges over the Bug River to hinder the German advance. Loud cannon and machine gun fire was frequently heard in Warsaw on Tuesday, but not yesterday. Neutral military observers here claim they do not believe the German army can immediately break through the Polish outer defenses. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to an official announcement this afternoon, German troops crossed the highway between Lask and Andrzejów at 2 PM and continued their advance towards Łódź. Lask is only thirty-three kilometers from Łódź, which has a population of 600,000 and is Poland's second-largest city and the center of Poland's textile industry. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: The Polish radio station broadcast a message today, calling on the able-bodied men of Warsaw to help build trenches around the city and instructing them to bring shovels and register at the nearest police station. According to French sources, Polish farmers have begun a large-scale search for German soldiers who have infiltrated behind Polish lines by parachute. It is reported that four German air force officers have been captured. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just released a war bulletin stating, "Our vanguard troops have entered German territory to varying depths. Everywhere they go, they encounter various enemy military installations. The air force has begun operations, coordinating with the army. Troop movements and deployments are proceeding according to plan, morale is excellent, and military supplies are being advanced according to plan." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just released a war bulletin stating that the French vanguard troops are advancing at various points along the front line outside the border, encountering machine gun and field artillery fire everywhere. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London: The official Polish radio station reported today that French troops have advanced to the outskirts of Saarbrücken (within five miles of the Saar region). After the French launched their first determined attack against the Germans yesterday, they advanced very quickly, giving the Germans no time to evacuate the police from Saarbrücken and several small towns along the French border. It was reported several months ago that Hitler had identified Saarbrücken as the weakest point on the western German front, and that this area would become the point of French attack into Germany. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to a telephone report from the front at 4 AM this morning, 600 French tanks have penetrated seven miles into the western German defenses, reaching several towns in the Saar region. The main French force is attacking towards Saarbrücken. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London: The British Broadcasting Corporation reported today that there was a major battle between French and German forces in the Moselle River area this morning. Under the cover of tanks, the French launched a large-scale attack on the German defenses. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London: An unconfirmed report from San Francisco states that French troops have advanced five or six miles into German territory. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters released a communiqué at 11 AM this morning, stating that there has been significant activity on both sides of the front. French heavy artillery continues to bombard German positions. There is fighting along the entire line between the Rhine and Moselle rivers. According to Le Petit Parisien, the activity is taking place within the strong fortifications of both sides, in what has become a no-man's land. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris: Paris Soir commented on the recent war bulletin released by the French General Headquarters, saying that there is artillery fire along the extremely strong defensive line along the Rhine River, from Basel to Strasbourg. The French are attacking northward, and the fighting is taking place between Haguenau and Luxembourg. Other newspapers reported that the French have achieved local victories, straightened their lines, and defeated German outposts. They also praised the courage of the Polish defense, saying that it has overturned the timetable set by the German General Staff. The Polish army is now engaged in a counter-offensive and is gradually winning victories. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Attack British East Coast, All Repelled by Anti-Aircraft Fire</h3>
<p>London: Air raid sirens sounded in various locations along the British east coast, including Chatham, Gillingham, Rochester, and Medway, at 7 AM yesterday morning. The all-clear was given at 9 AM. No bombing occurred. Several British fighter planes took off to patrol the area after the alert. Residents were very excited to see the British planes and calmly took shelter in air raid shelters, without any panic. However, no enemy aircraft were sighted until half an hour later, when a disguised German twin-engine bomber was spotted. Anti-aircraft units concentrated their fire on it, and the enemy aircraft quickly retreated. According to eyewitnesses, six enemy aircraft were seen, flying in pairs. After being repelled by anti-aircraft fire, they returned to attack again, but were still unsuccessful. It was observed that several anti-aircraft shells exploded near the tail of one enemy aircraft. While it is not known whether the aircraft was hit and crashed, it was definitely seen descending vertically. The anti-aircraft fire was very intense, and residents in the suburbs of London faintly heard the sound of gunfire. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Seventy German bombers dropped many explosive and incendiary bombs on the outskirts of Warsaw yesterday, causing many deaths and injuries. According to a communiqué released by the Air Defense Command, Polish anti-aircraft units shot down eight German aircraft. Three loud explosions were heard here yesterday morning. People evacuating Warsaw are moving elsewhere, while some remain here. A large number of people arrived here yesterday from Łódź. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The news that thirty Polish aircraft bombed Berlin has been widely reported in foreign newspapers, but Berlin residents laugh at this. There are four million residents in Berlin, including many foreign reporters, and no one has seen or heard of this air raid. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Information issued a statement this afternoon, stating that the rumor that British aircraft would fly to Berlin to bomb it is absolutely untrue. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>The Times Comments on the European War Situation</h3>
<p>London: The Times commented today on the progress of the European war, saying, "Looking at a map, one can clearly see that the Polish border is not easy to defend. Therefore, the German advance, in terms of both scope and speed, is within our expectations. In the minds of the Germans, however, they may not be satisfied with either of these two points." The newspaper added that the Polish elite troops have made their enemy pay a heavy price. The fact that the Poles did not deploy large numbers of troops to defend territory that they did not intend to hold firmly against a large-scale attack was a clever move. Therefore, the British public should expect the German army to continue to advance, and the Germans may make even greater progress in the north. At present, the Polish army does not show the demoralization that is inevitable after a military defeat. The Times also stated that the actual situation of the German military operations shows that Hitler has violated his promise that air raids would be limited to military targets. Germany has abused its air force, not only on the battlefield, but also in carrying out cruel massacres in undefended cities. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to the official newspaper here, the Polish military base of Westerplatte near the mouth of the Vistula River near Danzig was occupied by German troops this morning. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued an official report at 5 PM today, stating that German troops entered Kraków at noon today. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A reporter for the Mittagpost recently published an article in the newspaper, describing in detail the scene of the German army taking over the Graudenz fortress, stating, "The commander of a German regiment led his soldiers in a fierce battle at Graudenz for three days. Relying on the superior terrain and the soldiers' desperate advance, the Graudenz fortress was occupied at 2 PM on the 6th. At that time, church bells rang throughout the city, mixed with the sound of distant artillery. The German army triumphantly entered the fortress. The German army has now established anti-aircraft positions there to defend against air raids." (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Since the industrial centers of Katowice, Königshütte, and Mysłowice in Upper Silesia, as well as the industrial areas of Sosnowiec, Konin, and Będzin in the Dąbrowa region, have been occupied by German troops, most of Poland's heavy industry has fallen into German hands. The coal mines in the occupied area account for 95% of Poland's national production. The remaining 5% is produced in the Kraków area. In addition, the area that produces 108,000 tons of zinc and lead annually in Poland is also in German hands. There are also nitrogen chemical plants in the occupied area that have been seized by the German army. Items such as sulfuric acid, which are necessary for the manufacture of munitions, are also produced in the German-occupied area. Although the technicians and workers in the factories have retreated with the Polish army, the factories have not been destroyed. The German army is now advancing towards the oil region of Jasło, which produces 118,000 tons of oil annually, accounting for 24% of Poland's total oil production. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons; Poland's Courage in Resistance Not Diminished; Cooperation Between Britain and France Proceeding Smoothly</h3>
<p>London: When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to a question from Greenwood, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, stating, "Regarding the current situation and the state of our national defense, I can only give a brief overview. This is understandable to the House. Frankly, for the public interest, many issues are not appropriate to mention publicly here. After clarifying this need, I would like to give a brief report on the war situation. In the West, France has mobilized all its forces, and the situation is proceeding very smoothly, the same as in our country. France has also made contact with the enemy. On the Eastern Front, the Polish people are fighting a strong enemy, an enemy that relies on its abundant strength and armaments to destroy all resistance. But the Polish people do not show weakness, and their brave and determined resistance is worthy of the country's traditional spirit. Although the German air force is superior to Poland in quantity, strength, and equipment, Poland is resisting strongly, making the Germans pay a considerable price for every yard they advance. The Germans often say that they need a quick victory, and they seem to want to concentrate their forces to deal with Poland first. As you all know, it has been a week since the German army brazenly invaded Polish territory without a formal declaration of war. Although Poland has suffered losses in manpower and materials, morale is very good and courage has not diminished. In addition, the British and French governments signed an agreement with Poland today to replenish the country's resources, so it can continue to resist. As for France, since the beginning of the war, the nation's determination and solidarity with Poland have been completely consistent with our country. Britain and France have established full understanding, and the cooperation between the two sides is proceeding smoothly. As for our national defense, since last year, the government has taken various precautionary measures, especially in air defense. These measures have now proven to be very effective. The mobilization of army reservists is also proceeding very smoothly. The reservists who have been called up are all in high spirits, and many have already participated in voluntary military training. In addition, a large number of women have been recruited by the auxiliary units of the reserve army. They are able to work in difficult environments and provide comfort to the soldiers at the front, which is commendable." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>The King Issues an Edict Commending Chamberlain</h3>
<p>London: King George VI recently sent an edict to Prime Minister Chamberlain, stating, "Although we have strived to maintain peace, we have finally been forced to go to war. At this critical time for the country's destiny, I deeply appreciate the great efforts made by public officials at home and abroad in the past few years, including efforts to promote peace and prepare for extraordinary events. The dedication since you took office has been appreciated by the people, and I am confident that it will continue in the same spirit until peace is restored." Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "Reading the edict, I am deeply moved and humbled. I respectfully thank Your Majesty for your concern and express my loyalty on behalf of all subjects at home and abroad. All civil and military officials are grateful and determined to uphold the national tradition and fight for justice, freedom, and civilization, believing that they will not fail Your Majesty." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Government Emergency Budget; Chancellor of the Exchequer to Make a Declaration</h3>
<p>London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon declared in the House of Commons today that he will soon be able to make a declaration on the emergency budget. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>French Munitions Factories Intensify Production</h3>
<p>Paris: An official gazette recently published an order stipulating that the work week should be 65 hours, and that some munitions factories and other factories related to national defense should work 72 hours per week, with the distribution of time not exceeding 11 hours per day. In principle, women and children are not allowed to work more than 10 hours per day or 60 hours per week. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>British Political Parties Suspend Political Strife</h3>
<p>London: The political parties have recently established a "truce agreement," agreeing to suspend political strife and work together to overcome the difficulties. All election campaigns have been suspended. If there are vacancies for members of parliament, new election methods will be adopted, with each constituency automatically holding by-elections. This method is the same as the one that was implemented during the last World War. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Ambassador to France Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>Paris: The newly appointed Romanian Ambassador to France, Franasovici, presented his credentials to President Lebrun this morning and delivered a eulogy, saying, "The friendly relations between our two countries and your country's support for our country's free development have been historical. Our people will always remember it." President Lebrun replied, "Although all countries of good will have made many efforts to maintain peace, disaster has finally been unavoidable. At this time, countries around the world are fundamentally threatened. We hope that the spiritual and moral principles, the most valuable principles of mankind, will achieve final victory. Regarding this, I share the same sentiments as Your Excellency." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>British and French Economic Strategy Against Germany</h3>
<p>Paris: The establishment of a wartime economic department in the British cabinet has recently been commented on by well-informed sources here, stating that in the future, Britain and France will fight Germany not only on land, sea, and air, but also economically. French economic experts have arrived in London and have begun to cooperate with officials from the British wartime economic department to achieve coordination. Their main responsibility is to prevent Germany from obtaining the raw materials necessary for the war. Regarding this, Germany is in the same vulnerable position as in 1914. It is reported that they intend to purchase the raw materials they need through certain countries that have declared strict neutrality, in order to supplement their supplies. This type of method is worthy of attention. In addition, Germany's overall economic situation is extremely precarious. For example, in recent months, there has been a shortage of fuel, which will surely be felt during the war. This is one point. There are also many shortcomings in railway transportation, which can be seen from the official reports released over the past year. This is another point. During the last European war, the German railway organization was very good, and troops could often be transported from the east and west fronts overnight. Today, it is much inferior. The German authorities probably also know that it is difficult to fight on both fronts if transportation is not smooth, and they have not hesitated to admit that they want to end the war on the Eastern Front as soon as possible. At sea, the British and French navies have a great advantage, and it is not difficult to blockade the German coast. In just a few days after the start of the war, several German cargo ships have already been sunk. In addition, Egypt and Iraq have declared a severance of relations with Germany, which is very important. Germany has economic ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean. Given that Germany is the top trading partner in Turkey and the second largest trading partner in Egypt, this decision by Egypt and Iraq is a major blow to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States' Neutrality and England, France, and the Far East</h3>
<p>Three days after England and France declared war on Germany, U.S. President Roosevelt signed a declaration of neutrality, which Secretary of State Hull was ordered to announce; at the same time, the Neutrality Act was implemented. The declaration of neutrality lists seventeen articles, based on international law and the U.S. Neutrality Act; a special department was established under the State Department to implement the executive orders, and the Department of Justice was ordered to enforce the law. The most noteworthy aspect is that the current U.S. Neutrality Act strictly prohibits the supply of munitions to belligerent countries; the political struggle in the last U.S. Congress used this as a tool, developing into a struggle over American foreign policy. In essence, the key point is: American foreign policy, toward the Americas and the Far East, is almost unanimous across the country, with no partisan differences; toward Europe, some advocate isolation, others favor closer ties with England. Those who advocate isolation argue for maintaining the current Neutrality Act, which strictly prohibits the supply of munitions to any belligerent country; those who favor closer ties with England not only advocate providing England with conveniences but also believe that it should be given substantial assistance. President Roosevelt is trying to strike a balance, advocating for amending the Neutrality Act while leaving room for flexibility; this is the general situation.</p>
<p>It is impossible and unnecessary for the United States to immediately join this European war at the outset. There are two other options: one, immediately declare neutrality and implement the Neutrality Act, as is being done today; and then, depending on the development of the situation, decide whether to convene a special session of Congress to amend the Neutrality Act, in order to help the democratic nations of England and France in Europe resist aggression. The second option is to temporarily not declare neutrality, while providing any belligerent country with the convenience of purchasing munitions in the United States, and then calmly convene Congress, leveraging the innate emotional connection between the United States and England, to promote the passage of the Neutrality Act amendment, and then declare neutrality; based on past precedent, President Wilson did not declare neutrality until more than a hundred days after the outbreak of the war in Europe during the First World War, so it is said that there is no need to rush to declare neutrality now.</p>
<p>Now, President Roosevelt has resolutely decided to declare neutrality instead of taking the second path. What is the reason for this? Is it a sign of defeat in political struggle? Is it an indifferent attitude, without favoring or disliking England and France versus Germany, standing by and watching the outcome? None of these are true. I believe that the United States' hasty declaration of neutrality, in addition to the general reasons for any country declaring neutrality in international wars, based on our inner feelings and the conclusions drawn from objective facts, is due to President Roosevelt's unique and painstaking efforts; there are two reasons related to domestic politics, two reasons related to the actual needs of England and France, and one reason related to the overall international policy of the United States, which requires deep understanding and thorough reflection from England and France; only with these five points can one declare neutrality immediately without hesitation.</p>
<p>Why do I say this? President Roosevelt has foresight, integrity, and possesses the qualities of a great statesman. He has insightful and genuine knowledge of international developments and the amendment of the Neutrality Act; when the European war had not yet begun, he was already constrained by the isolationists in Congress, and now that the war has broken out, he can still retain the great power to declare neutrality, using the safety of the United States and its people in the European war as a bet, to drive members of Congress to accept the Neutrality Act amendment; manipulating the situation in this way, seeking solutions through changes, is what general politicians excel at, but President Roosevelt respects the essence of the rule of law, urgently addressing what the country and its people urgently need, preferring to delay amendment and prioritize neutrality; this is the demeanor of a great statesman, one reason related to politics. The isolationist faction is relatively isolated, but their alarmist rhetoric is enough to influence a portion of public opinion; considering the long-term safety of the United States and the feelings of the American people toward England, the isolationist faction is indeed a fringe rather than the mainstream; therefore, rather than hastily submitting the Neutrality Act amendment to a special session of Congress and fighting with the isolationist faction, it is better to calmly submit it to the judgment of the people's conscience, waiting for public opinion to mature; this is the ultimate principle of democratic politics, another reason related to politics. The military equipment and all other strengths of England and France can be said to be deep-rooted and long-lasting, which cannot be matched by a rapidly rising nation; at the beginning of the war, their reserves are still abundant, and they do not urgently need to seek replenishment from the United States; therefore, the United States' declaration of neutrality today, prohibiting the export of munitions, does not affect the war effort of England and France; this is one reason related to the actual needs of England and France. Moreover, what the U.S. Neutrality Act prohibits is the supply of munitions to belligerent countries; countries that are not in a state of war are not prohibited from purchasing munitions by the U.S. Neutrality Act; England and France are united, and the British colonies and dominions have successively declared a state of war with Germany following England, but Canada is an exception; Canada is one of the pillars of Great Britain and is adjacent to the United States; therefore, although the United States implements the Neutrality Act, England and France can still purchase American munitions from Canada; this does not hinder the actual needs of England and France, another reason. From these four points, it can be seen that the United States' neutrality today is not only not detrimental to England and France but also maintains its traditional closeness with England and France. However, granting or withholding, facilitating or obstructing, still depends on how the authority wields its power; President Roosevelt is the embodiment of American authority; granting and facilitating what is in line with American policy is within the president's power; withholding and obstructing what is contrary to American policy is also within the president's power. How the United States treats England and France is one part of American international policy, and how it treats the Far East is another part; Secretary of State Hull said in a statement yesterday, "The United States is closely monitoring the situation in the Far East;" at the same time, according to well-informed sources in the United States, "The United States must prioritize Far Eastern interests according to traditional customs;" furthermore, at this time, the United States is strengthening the strength of its Philippine fleet; from all of this, the United States' Far Eastern policy is clearly visible. Therefore, will the convenience that the United States is willing to seek for England and France be weighed against the attitude that England and France take in the Far East? A week ago, this newspaper already said: "Some believe that England and France can win over Japan to offset the defection of the Soviet Union, but in fact, if England and France's actions in the Far East conflict with American policy, then winning over Japan can also offset American sympathy."</p>
<p>The reason why the United States declared neutrality is closely related to the entire international policy of the United States, which requires deep understanding and thorough reflection from England and France.</p>
<p>What needs 'reflection'? The talk of appeasing the Far East by yielding to Japan is rife!</p>
<h3>U.S. Authorities Announce Close Attention to the Far East Situation, Dispatch Aircraft Carrier to Manila to Prevent Infringement of U.S. Neutrality Rights</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the United States is closely monitoring the situation in the Far East and has been paying close attention to Japan's request for British and French troops to withdraw from China. Well-informed sources also said that the actions taken by the U.S. government contain deeper meaning than words. The U.S. fleet is currently concentrated in the Pacific, and the aircraft carrier "Langley" has been ordered to sail to Manila to enhance the strength of the Asian fleet. The U.S. Far East policy will not change, and according to traditional customs, Far Eastern interests must be prioritized, (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. Navy ordered the aircraft carrier "Langley," stationed at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands, last night to immediately proceed to the Philippines to strengthen the U.S. Asian fleet. According to sources in Honolulu, the "Langley" will sail to the Philippines today with naval personnel and aircraft. Naval officials claimed that the "Langley" was dispatched to protect the bays and entrances of the Philippines to prevent violations of the U.S. Neutrality Act. Well-informed sources said that the Navy has adopted special alert measures to prevent neutral actions within U.S. territory and possessions. The U.S. actions in the Philippines should not be regarded as military actions in the Far East. Government officials here claimed that strengthening the U.S. Asian fleet is an internal matter of implementing the Neutrality Act, which local authorities cannot handle. Naval authorities have also stepped up patrols along the U.S. coast to curb violations of the Neutrality Act. Naval officials said that the Navy Department has not yet ordered the strengthening of U.S. Far Eastern fortresses. Currently, in addition to constructing already approved three-year plan projects and increasing necessary construction personnel, surveyors, and inspectors, there have been no increases in personnel and aircraft in remote Pacific bases. Most bases cannot be used on a large scale until construction is completed. All parts of the U.S. Navy have been ordered to cooperate to ensure U.S. neutrality. Naval officials recalled the many difficulties in implementing neutrality in the Philippine Islands, because the coastline there is very long and difficult to monitor. Belligerent countries may attempt to use many small bays in the Philippines as naval aircraft bases, or use Philippine ports for refueling and supply. The Air Force belonging to the Asian fleet has been ordered to implement President Roosevelt's regulations prohibiting belligerent warships from staying in ports for more than 24 hours and preventing fuel increases of more than one in three months. The Navy must prevent any belligerent country from using the Philippines and attempting to hinder American maritime commerce. Maintaining neutrality is the duty of the American troops in the Far East, (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Department Manages Panama Canal and Dispatches Warships to Patrol U.S. Waters</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt recently ordered the Navy Department to dispatch warships to patrol U.S. waters to monitor the actions of warships of various European belligerent countries. According to White House Secretary Early, this measure is of a precautionary nature, and details cannot be disclosed. In addition, the President also issued an order placing the Panama Canal under the management of the War Department. According to War Secretary Woodring, this measure has been under consideration for some time, and its purpose is to ensure the safety of the canal during this period of international tension, (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Details of the Athena Disaster, British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill Reports in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London - First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill announced in the House of Commons today regarding the sinking of the British 13,456-ton merchant ship Athena by a German submarine off the west coast of Scotland on September 4. He said that according to the sworn testimony given by the ship's first mate and rescued British and American citizens, the ship was sunk by a German submarine without warning. Based on current knowledge, the number of victims may be greater than previously reported. There were 1,480 people on board, including 326 crew members and 1,102 passengers. 125 people are still missing. At 7:45 p.m. that day, the ship's port engine room was hit by a torpedo. Then, the German submarine surfaced and fired the first shot at the ship, and the shells exploded on the deck. At this point, the submarine circled the gradually sinking Athena, and was seen by many passengers. Rescued American passengers also stated in their sworn testimony that they had seen the German submarine. The exact number of casualties is still unknown. How many people died in the first bombing, and how many people drowned due to the capsizing of the lifeboats, cannot be estimated. In addition to those rescued by two British destroyers and the merchant ships Nelson and Flintshire, a large Swedish yacht also rescued some people. As far as is known, about 125 people are missing, some of whom may be on the Swedish yacht. The Athena was not equipped with self-defense weapons, did not carry artillery, and its deck was not prepared for carrying artillery. He expressed deep sympathy to the families of the victims. The German submarine did not give a warning before bombing the Athena, leaving people unprepared to escape. The treatment that British warships gave to the crew and passengers when nearly sinking two German ships was completely different. British warships first tried to preserve the lives of the people on board, and then sank the ship. The New York Post, a neutral newspaper, once reported that German crew members were able to calmly pack their belongings into lifeboats, and that a German ship captain expressed gratitude for the treatment given by British warships when arriving at a port in Uruguay. The difference between British and German benevolence and violence is such, Churchill said. Churchill then answered a question from a member of Parliament, saying that there is no doubt that the Athena sailed out before Britain declared war, and it is also very clear that the German submarine must have been lurking in the sea at that time, waiting to attack, (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>German Army Commander Encourages Troops - German Troops Pay Respects at Pilsudski's Tomb</h3>
<p>Berlin - German Army Commander-in-Chief General von Brauchitsch issued the following proclamation to the soldiers on the Eastern Front yesterday: "Soldiers of the Eastern Front, greetings. Krakow, Bromberg, and Graudenz have fallen into our hands. East Prussia and Danzig are no longer separated from the Fatherland by the Corridor. The enemy has been defeated and is retreating across the entire front. The rapid achievement of this initial success is entirely due to the dedication of all officers and soldiers, and the protection provided by the Air Force. I express my deep appreciation. This is a major achievement in the history of the German Army. After our army conquered Krakow, the tomb of the late General Pilsudski fell into our hands. Although Pilsudski led the Polish army in the First World War, his policy goals were entirely based on peace with Germany. The German army should respect this great soldier. At the same time, in accordance with the Führer's order, a guard of honor has been formed at his tomb. The greatest achievements still depend on the completion by all soldiers. It is hoped that you will pursue and annihilate the enemy to achieve complete victory. The entire German people will fully support you.

<p>London - This afternoon, a member of the House of Commons asked whether the British government had received formal notification of the neutrality of the four countries of the Soviet Union, Italy, Japan, and Spain.

Foreign Secretary Halifax learned on September 4 that the Spanish government had issued a declaration of neutrality. The Japanese government has also stated that it will take a non-interventionist stance. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Danzig - Newspapers here have printed news from the German side in large characters, claiming that a new axis of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan is being organized, led by Berlin. To this end, a Soviet military delegation is in Berlin for discussions. An Italian military delegation is expected to arrive in Berlin soon, and negotiations on a non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan are being conducted simultaneously with this activity.

<p>Moscow - It is rumored that Japanese Ambassador to Moscow, Shigenori Tōgō, held talks with People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov, yesterday. Both sides sought solutions to the conflicts in the Outer Mongolia region. Japanese sources here denied this, saying that Ambassador Tōgō did not see Molotov, nor was a meeting scheduled. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Regarding the news of a meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Tōgō, well-informed Chinese sources here stated that it is impossible for the Soviet Union and Japan to sign a non-aggression pact, at least not at present. It is believed that unless the Soviet Union and Japan reach a compromise on various outstanding issues between them, such as the situation on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border, Japanese fishing rights in Sakhalin, and oil exploitation rights, such a pact is unlikely to be concluded. Currently, the Soviet-Japanese negotiations are mainly aimed at discussing a temporary ceasefire agreement for the current war in the Nomonhan region. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Tokyo Stock Exchange saw a surge in market prices on Monday due to the European war. However, Finance Minister Aoki warned banks on Monday afternoon not to provide funds for speculative purposes. As a result, the booming market, which lasted for only a day, was extinguished. Not only did the stock price surge stop, but it also declined across the board. Today, the prices of various stocks fell by 27 sen to 4 yen. However, confidence remained strong, especially for textiles and rayon stocks, which were still 1 to 4 yen higher than before. At the same time, the price of raw silk in New York reached a new high of 1,500 yen per 100-pound bale, forcing the Yokohama Silk Exchange to suspend trading. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>New York - It is reported that Japanese merchants are preparing to order machinery worth 10 million yuan to fill the facilities of a truck factory in the Americas.

<p>London - Well-informed sources here recently stated that after the establishment of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, relations between Britain and Japan are expected to improve in the shortest possible time. Although the Chinese currency issue may pose an obstacle, a compromise solution may be found to avoid a concrete resolution for the time being, so that Britain and Japan can achieve the desire for appeasement in the Far East. This compromise plan is being studied by the British government and will be discussed informally with the Japanese government. As of now, after mutually testing opinions, both sides have entered a state of "spiritual disarmament." In the future, various thorny issues can be discussed in a favorable environment. However, the main principles on which British Far Eastern policy is based will not be forced to be abandoned. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>German Authorities Unwilling to Expand War - Intent on Reconciling with France</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland - Swiss newspapers have published messages from correspondents stationed in Berlin, all stating that German officials are still emphasizing that the scope of the war will not expand. The Basler Nachrichten reported, "German officials have recently been propagating to domestic and neutral countries' public opinion that Britain and France are assisting Poland without the determination to fight to the end." A spokesman for the German government, based on the slogan "Germany has no demands on France," gave a speech to reporters from neutral newspapers, saying that the German army does not intend to take the offensive on the Western Front and will limit itself to retaliation against Britain. According to the German officials' intentions, they deeply hope that the scope of the war will not expand, but the generalization of military action is inevitable. It will be seen that German public opinion will be greatly disappointed, which can be asserted. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin - General opinion here does not seem to hold ill will towards France. It is generally believed that France's involvement in the war is entirely due to Britain's control. The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Foreign Policy Correspondence," stated that the final stage of Anglo-German negotiations was unfortunately not notified to France. Otherwise, it would be known that France also accepted the Italian mediation, the same as Germany. The responsibility for the war should be entirely borne by Britain. Although France's position is not threatened by Germany today, it has been forced to prepare to attack Germany. The newspaper stated that the German nation is willing to resolve the century-old feud with France and reconcile. However, if France attacks without reason, it will eliminate the hope of extending peace between the two countries for hundreds of years. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>German Battlefield Deaths and Injuries Secretly Not Announced</h3>
<p>Danzig - A Danish newspaper's Berlin correspondent reported that the German authorities refused to announce the names of the dead and wounded. When German soldiers die in battle, the authorities often notify their families and strictly order them not to tell others or hold mourning ceremonies. The correspondent visited Saarbrücken and said that the city was lifeless, and all the women and children had been evacuated. They traveled by train during the evacuation, which was extremely crowded. A small compartment of the train had as many as thirty-two people. The only sign of activity was the French searchlights sweeping the sky every night. German newspapers stated that several Germans were listening to absolutely prohibited foreign broadcasts, and they were telling others what they had heard. These people have committed a crime against the entire German people and are now being detained awaiting judgment. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Anti-War Demonstrations Discovered in Germany</h3>
<p>Brussels - The newspaper Le Temps here reported that, according to Italian broadcasts, anti-war demonstrations have been discovered in Berlin, Prague, and Vienna. However, these movements have been violently dissolved by the German secret police. In addition, the Belgian newspaper La Libre Belgique reported that disturbances occurred in Cologne, Düsseldorf, Essen, Barmen, and Pilsen, where the Škoda armaments factory is located. It is reported that powerful Black Guards have been dispatched from Dresden and Leipzig to Bohemia and Moravia. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Anti-German Demonstrations in Ruthenia</h3>
<p>Sighet, Romania - It is reported that anti-German demonstrations took place yesterday in various parts of Ruthenia, which was occupied by Hungary last September.

<h3>The Last Scene of Anglo-Franco-German Diplomacy - German Side Publishes Documents</h3>
<p>Berlin - Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with the French Ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, on September 3 and held important talks. Today, the authorities published the following communiqué on the content of the talks, which stated: "When the French people learned that German Führer Hitler and French Prime Minister Daladier had exchanged letters, the French government still attempted to conceal the final state of diplomatic negotiations from the public. Therefore, except for a few well-informed people, the general public did not know that the French government had agreed to the Italian mediation plan. (According to the Italian mediation plan, Germany was also satisfied and accepted it.) Therefore, the French people did not know that the breakdown of the last chance for peace was due to Britain's tough stance. Britain did not hesitate to obstruct the Italian mediation plan and insisted on Germany's immediate withdrawal from the liberated area. Britain even put pressure on France, forcing it to adopt the same tough stance. Therefore, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts ultimately failed. On the morning of September 3, British Ambassador to Germany Henderson presented a note from his government to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, demanding that German troops withdraw from Poland within two hours, and informed him that if Germany rejected this final note, Britain would take military action. At 12:20 on the same day, French Ambassador Coulondre also visited Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the Foreign Ministry. The official documents of Britain and France were not consistent on the time, which shows that the attitudes of Britain and France towards Germany were not entirely the same. However, at the final moment, France bowed to Britain and accepted its political leadership. The French people will certainly be happy to hear about the content of the talks between Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Ambassador Coulondre on September 3. At that time, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop clearly explained to Ambassador Coulondre the reasons why Germany rejected Britain's final ultimatum and handed him a memorandum on the matter. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop said, "If France's attitude towards Germany is the same as that of Britain, the German government can only regret it. Germany will work to promote understanding between Germany and France, and has never intended to invade France. If France ignores Germany's efforts to build understanding, the French people will sacrifice their lives on the German Western Front." At that time, the note presented by French Ambassador Coulondre stated that France would be forced to fulfill its obligations to Poland from 5 pm on September 3. Accordingly, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop reiterated to Ambassador Coulondre that Germany did not intend to attack France. If France attacks Germany, France should be responsible for the losses caused by this war." (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Last night, the German authorities issued a white paper explaining the final stage of the German-Polish crisis. "At the beginning of August, Germany learned that Poland and Danzig had exchanged notes. Poland demanded that the Danzig Senate revoke the order involving the actions of Polish customs inspectors. Therefore, on August 9, the German government warned the Polish government that if such a strict demand was made again, relations between Germany and Poland would deteriorate, and the situation would be very serious and should not be ignored. If there were any changes, the Polish government should be responsible. The next day, the Polish government replied to the German Embassy in Poland with a note, the main point of which was that if the German government intervened in the Danzig incident, the Polish government would consider it an act of aggression, because the Danzig incident seriously disregarded Poland's rights and interests in the Free City of Danzig. On August 22, British Prime Minister Chamberlain wrote to Führer Hitler, solemnly stating Britain's determination to fulfill its promise to Poland and stating that negotiations should be conducted to reach a mutually agreeable solution to the German-Polish dispute to establish an internationally guaranteed agreement. Hitler replied on the 23rd, explaining the causes of the German-Polish crisis and refuting the inaccuracies of rumors circulating in Britain about Germany's mobilization against Poland and its aggressive plans against Hungary and Romania. Then, he explained that the result of Britain and France guaranteeing Poland was not only to encourage the Polish government to reject Germany's demands, but also to fuel Poland's arrogance, leading to the adoption of terrorist actions against the German minority in Poland. Hitler reiterated that no one could prevent Germany from protecting its vital interests. Although the British Prime Minister's letter and the speeches made by British political figures the following day failed to understand Germany's views, Führer Hitler still intended to make another attempt to establish an agreement with Britain. On August 25, Hitler met with British Ambassador to Germany Henderson, explained Germany's views in detail, and handed Henderson an outline of Germany's plan to propose a permanent understanding between Britain and Germany after resolving the Danzig and Corridor issues. While the British government was considering the above-mentioned note, Führer Hitler exchanged letters with French Prime Minister Daladier. In his reply, Hitler clearly expressed Germany's attitude towards Poland to Daladier and reiterated his determination to maintain the existing borders between Germany and France. The British government replied to Germany's note of August 25 on August 28, stating that it was willing to consider adjusting Anglo-German relations and informing it that the Polish government was willing to conduct direct negotiations with Germany. Britain proposed that the agreement signed by Germany and Poland should be guaranteed internationally. Although the Polish government's past attitude made it inevitable to suspect its statement, Führer Hitler still replied to British Ambassador Henderson on the afternoon of August 29, stating that Germany accepted Britain's proposal and hoped that Poland would send responsible personnel to Berlin on August 30 to discuss the matter. Hitler reiterated that the German government would draft a solution and send it to the British government for consideration when the Polish plenipotentiary ambassador arrived in Berlin. However, by August 30, the Polish negotiator had not arrived in Berlin, and the British government had not shown any intention of conducting negotiations. The German government authorities only received news of Poland's mobilization and received a British memorandum in the evening, which only stated that the German reply would be forwarded to Poland. At that time, the German government still planned to hold talks based on the outline, but Polish Ambassador Lipski verbally informed German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop that Poland was considering the issue of direct negotiations, but said that there were no new instructions. Germany waited in vain for two days and then announced the sixteen-point German proposal on August 31. The Polish radio station deemed it unacceptable. Since all peaceful methods had completely failed, the Führer was forced to resort to force to seek the liberation of the German minority and the city of Danzig, and to prevent repeated invasions of German territory. On the evening of August 31, the British and French ambassadors presented a note to the German government, stating that if German troops did not withdraw from Poland, Britain and France would fulfill their obligation to guarantee assistance. The German Foreign Minister stated that Germany rejected this suggestion from Britain and France. When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini proposed mediation, Germany expressed acceptance, but the speeches of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax indicated rejection. Therefore, Mussolini's efforts for peace have been destroyed by Britain. At 9 am on September 3, the British Ambassador to Germany submitted a memorandum to the German Foreign Ministry, demanding the withdrawal of troops in Poland within two hours. At 11:15 am on the same day, British Foreign Secretary Halifax informed the German Chargé d'Affaires that London believed that it had entered a state of war with Germany. On the other hand, the German Foreign Ministry also notified the British Ambassador at 11 am on the same day that Germany could not accept the British ultimatum, and Britain should bear any responsibility for causing the war. At noon on the same day, the French Ambassador also submitted a memorandum to Germany, demanding the withdrawal of German troops in Poland by 5 pm, otherwise France would be forced to assist Poland. The German Foreign Ministry stated that if France wanted to attack Germany, France should bear all the painful responsibility. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance Decides to Maintain the Exchange Rate with the Pound Sterling</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Today's Asahi Shimbun reported that the Japanese Ministry of Finance is closely observing the development of the international economic situation and believes that there is no sufficient reason to change the link between the pound sterling and the yen for the time being. Therefore, it has decided to maintain the current exchange rate of one yen for one shilling and two pence. As for what kind of treatment the British government will give to the exchange settlement of the pound sterling group or British colonies with third countries, there is no news yet. This is a matter of great importance to Japan's export trade. In terms of the relationship between the yen and the US dollar, there is a question that must be further studied, that is, whether the current exchange rate of two shillings, three pence, six two five for the US dollar is suitable for Japan's economic situation and Japan's trade policy.

<h3>All Circles in Chongqing are Watching the Actions of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>It is Expected that They Will Take the Opportunity to Intensify Pressure. Three Divisions Gathered Downstream of Shashi.</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese army is currently concentrated in the Hankou area, especially on the north bank of the Yangtze River east of Yichang. It is being closely monitored. Some parties now expect that the Japanese army may take advantage of the opportunity of the European war to make a desperate attempt to rush into the interior. According to the Chinese army, three divisions of the Japanese army have gathered downstream of Shashi. According to unconfirmed news, nine Chinese aircraft flew downstream yesterday. It was not mentioned whether they wanted to bomb the Japanese army concentrated there or just conduct reconnaissance flights. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Chinese officials and the general public here are deeply concerned about the Japanese side's request for the withdrawal of British and French land and naval forces in China. The Japanese side's request is obviously a smokescreen for expelling foreign interests in China. The Japanese side's sudden adoption of this attitude towards Britain and France is obviously due to the failure of the pro-British and French policy since the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. It is also sufficient to reveal that Japanese warlords have decided to take advantage of the opportunity of the European war to intensify their military operations against China. However, this request is sufficient to cause armed conflict with other countries. Japan also wants the British army currently stationed in Kowloon to withdraw. Furthermore, Japan will definitely follow the old trick of seizing Qingdao and the Caroline Islands before the last European war, occupying the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the British and French concessions in Hankou and Shanghai, and the Kowloon Peninsula. Afterwards, it will directly threaten Hong Kong and Annam. Chinese officials here believe that Japan's intentions in the South China Sea are to threaten Hong Kong and Hanoi.

<h3>Prices in Chongqing are Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Although import taxes have been drastically reduced and the legal tender has recently improved, prices in Chongqing have risen daily since the outbreak of the European war.

The cheapest local blue cloth has risen from five jiao per foot to one yuan and one jiao, almost the same price as silk in peacetime. However, some local products, due to possible difficulties in exporting, are currently trending downward, especially the prices of white wax and tung oil, which have fallen by 13%. After the government announced the nationalization of gold, there was very little trading in jewelry stores. Silver shops no longer post gold prices. The sales of newspapers are increasing daily. The sales of many newspapers are even more than before Chongqing was bombed on May 3. Several German trading houses here are closing their Chongqing businesses. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Military Stronghold in a Strategically Important Location, Hengyang is Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Prosperous Market and Busy Transportation; Northern Section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Has Been Dismantled</p>
<p>Hengyang Correspondence. Hengyang is a major town in southern Hunan. Mount Heng, the southern peak, is only a few dozen miles away from here and borders Lechang in Guangdong. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, it has grown up in the smoke of bombing.</p>
<p>The northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway from here to Changsha has been dismantled, and the materials have been moved to the滇缅路 to build a road connecting international routes. The recently completed Xiang-Gui Railway starts from here and leads directly to Guilin in Guangxi. The vehicles coming and going every day are crowded with people. Military supplies and food are transported by this major artery. It has contributed greatly to the War of Resistance today. Japanese aircraft have dropped many bombs that their people worked hard to accumulate on this road, but the Chinese have a gift for manual labor. After each major destruction, they soon repair it and resume traffic as before.</p>
<p>The third phase of the general battle will soon unfold here. The continuous Mount Heng is hiding countless steel-like fighters. Many mountain peaks have been built into steel fortresses according to the strategic importance of the mountains and rivers. In the future battle, they will surely promote their tenacity and perform many earth-shattering achievements.</p>
<p>Since the successive fall of Hankou and Nanchang, Changsha, under the threat of Japanese artillery fire, has promoted its original value, and this place has taken Changsha's place. Now, the battlefront of Gan and E, which is under bitter fighting, is supported by this place. The healthy children who are sent to the front line to participate in the war are constantly starting. The people living in Hengyang are very calm and have no fear of the war. The market is bustling with people coming and going. Soldiers, political work teams, and youth groups can be seen everywhere working hard. The roar of the War of Resistance fills every corner. The old Hengyang is growing up in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>The four problems of clothing, food, housing, and transportation here, except for clothing, which is more expensive due to its reliance on foreign sources, there is no inconvenience in terms of food, housing, and transportation, because the standard of living in the interior is lower than in other cities. Rice can be purchased for ten to twelve kilograms per yuan of national currency, pork for five or six jiao per kilogram, and raw oil for five or six jiao per kilogram. In addition, vegetables are very cheap. However, imported goods and daily necessities have risen to unimaginable prices. As for housing, it can be found everywhere. Although hotels are popular, they are not expensive. In terms of transportation, it is also very convenient except in military areas. There are trains and cars that can be taken to various places. Most people entering the interior take the Xiang-Gui Railway to Guilin in Guangxi, and then transfer to the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. In addition, there is also a Xiang-Gui Highway that leads directly to Guilin. Like the railway, dozens of cars fly on this snake-like highway day and night, coming and going.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Killing of the Puppet Magistrate of Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Innocent Youths Tragically Arrested</p>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence. In recent times, the Chinese army in the four suburbs of this town has been very active. Therefore, the Japanese army is actively building highways, attempting to facilitate the mobilization of large forces and carry out the so-called "mopping-up" work. Therefore, it instructed the puppet county government to order the puppet workshops and town offices to organize a conscription system to engage in road construction. All those who are seventeen years old or older must serve for three days. If they cannot serve, they must pay a commutation fee of five jiao per day. After this method was implemented, the Chinese side ordered several daredevils to sneak into the city, take the opportunity to drive their own cars, distribute leaflets, advise the people to refuse to serve in the labor force, and hope that the people would leave the occupied area as soon as possible. At the same time, they warned the puppet magistrate, Shen Hanqing, to wake up quickly and stop helping the tiger do evil. However, the puppet police caught a glimpse of it and wanted to arrest them. However, the Chinese daredevils had already driven away. It is said that a puppet policeman chased them to the south gate, but only obtained one car. The matter was heard by the Japanese side, so they ordered a search. Although they found nothing, the residents were very disturbed. After being warned, the puppet magistrate Shen Hanqing still did not repent. The Chinese military authorities then dispatched patriots to come to He City again and lurked near the puppet government to first investigate Shen's daily whereabouts. One day at 7:00 p.m., Shen was taking his eldest son from the puppet county government to his residence. As he was passing near the West County overseas Chinese, he was spotted by Chinese patriots, who took out their pistols and shot Shen continuously. Shen and his eldest son fell to the ground. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the Chinese patriots left calmly from Xianchang Lane. Later, the puppet police station and the Japanese side sent Shen's father and son to the Beimen Puppet Jiaxing Hospital (formerly the Gospel Hospital) for treatment. However, Shen himself was shot in various vital parts of his body, so he died before reaching the hospital. His son was sent to the hospital, and his injuries were also very serious. After this incident, the entire city was immediately declared under martial law, prohibiting entry and exit, and searching house by house. As of the third day, He City was still under martial law and being searched. It is said that during these three days, more than ten innocent youths were tragically arrested and are currently being interrogated by the Japanese military police.</p>
<h3>Empty Buildings; 100,000 People Have Left Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence. Recently, due to the Japanese army's heavy deployment of troops in Shenzhen, the situation in Hong Kong has been tense. Residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon have been evacuating one after another. According to unofficial statistics, more than 100,000 people have left Hong Kong in the past two weeks. Due to this relationship, there are many empty houses in Hong Kong and Kowloon with red signs saying "For Rent." However, there are very few empty office buildings. As for Macau, due to the sudden increase in population, prices and rents have all soared. Those who fled to Macau also feel the hardship of living in Chang'an.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Conflicting reports of positive and negative factors abound; the gold market is extremely chaotic; fluctuating by 580 yuan throughout the day, seemingly detached from currency and operating independently.</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot gold's black market saw even greater volatility. Fluctuations were unpredictable, making it difficult to discern the direction of the market. The market situation was extremely chaotic, with operators taking vastly different approaches. Some bid at 100 yuan, while others offered to sell at several tens of yuan less. Though occurring simultaneously, price differences of tens of yuan were common and considered unsurprising, highlighting the feverish speculation. However, industry sentiment shifted from firm to weary, initially fueled by reports of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan forming an alliance, along with rumors that Chamberlain sought to appease the Far East and compromise with Japan. Coupled with tight foreign exchange, the market opened with a jump of 205 yuan, reaching 4,100 yuan. Subsequently, heavy buying pushed it further to a peak of 4,330 yuan. However, gold firms suddenly took profits, and foreign exchange eased, slightly dampening the bullish momentum, causing it to fluctuate between 4,200 and 4,300 yuan. After 10:30 AM, strong rumors of peace in the Far East emerged, leading to a decline to 4,110 yuan by noon. The afternoon started stable, opening at 4,130 yuan, but a large volume of sales from Hong Kong traders suddenly appeared. Buyers, pressured by the peace rumors and reports of easing foreign exchange, remained hesitant, causing the price to plummet by over 300 yuan to a low of 3,750 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange rate weakened again, and silver shops and money changers successively bought in, pushing the closing price back up to 3,960 yuan. The result was a net increase of 65 yuan compared to the 10th. However, when based on the internal foreign exchange rate and the U.S. dollar settlement price, there was a difference of as much as 1,400 yuan. The value of gold was so volatile, being pushed up and pulled down so rapidly, that it had become independent of currency. Daily trading volume was substantial, exceeding 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry in silver shops continued to rise by 5 yuan. There were no changes in the customs gold price or the prices of various businesses.</p>
<h3>Spot Gold Still Up 65 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since this morning, each bar (ten taels) opened with strong market sentiment due to a shrinking foreign exchange report. Buyers swarmed in, aggressively bidding up prices. Sellers held back, watching as the bullish trend became as intense as a charging horse. By 9:25 AM, the opening price was 205 yuan higher than the previous day. Money changers bought 20 taels from silver shops at 4,100 yuan. A Russian gold firm sold 10 taels to money changers at 4,010 yuan, but it couldn't be considered an official market price, as it was difficult to buy even at 4,100 yuan. Rumors were rife in the market, and there was no consensus. Coupled with the shrinking foreign exchange rate, both official and black market, the buying frenzy intensified. Certain silver shops competed to acquire gold for their customers, causing the price to surge. In an instant, it leaped 320 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from silver shops at 4,330 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm suddenly took profits at the high, causing the bullish momentum to falter and dropping prices by 130 yuan. A certain Yu firm sold a total of 50 taels to money changers and fellow firms at 4,200 yuan. Later, money changers absorbed several tens of taels, briefly pushing the price back to 4,230 yuan. Then, a certain gold firm traded 30 taels internally at 4,170 yuan. Later, a certain broker bought 10 taels from a cash firm, pushing the price up to 4,200 yuan. At that time, a certain atmosphere was prevalent in the market, and the foreign exchange rate stopped tightening and started to harden. Securities firms and money changers quickly shifted their focus and rushed to close their positions. Simultaneously, silver shops were also actively selling, dumping gold at 60 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to gold firms at 4,140 yuan. It was said that a certain gold firm had a strong appetite and pushed the price back up to 4,190 yuan. Afterwards, because outside sellers had a large number of positions, the price couldn't sustain the increase and fell again. Money changers traded 10 taels internally at 4,110 yuan, setting the closing price for the morning session. The afternoon opened stable. Initially, money changers bought 30 taels from gold firms at 4,130 yuan. There were reports of easing foreign exchange rates and Hong Kong traders taking profits. Furthermore, general buyers were restrained by the peace rumors and remained cautious, causing a lack of support in the market. The price plummeted by 380 yuan. Gold firms and securities firms sold a total of 50 taels to money changers at 3,750 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange rate softened again, and sellers gradually decreased. Money changers and silver shops took advantage of the low prices and aggressively bought in, quickly pushing the price back up by 210 yuan. Silver shops bought 30 taels from money changers at 3,960 yuan, setting the closing price for the evening session. The result was an increase of 65 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 580 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher than spot gold. Spot gold was 55 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<h3>Gold Jewelry Adjusted to 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>The initial price for gold jewelry at silver shops was 395 yuan per tael. At 9:30 AM, the price increased by 5 yuan, at 9:35 AM it increased again by 20 yuan, then by another 15 yuan after five minutes. At 9:50 AM, it dropped by 10 yuan, and at 10:15 AM, it dropped again by 5 yuan. At noon, it dropped again by 5 yuan. At 2:20 PM, it increased by 5 yuan, and after ten minutes, it decreased by 10 yuan. Shortly after, it decreased again by 10 yuan. At 3:25 PM, it suddenly increased by 5 yuan, and at 4:00 PM, it increased again by 5 yuan. As a result, the price increased by 5 yuan, and the major shops adjusted to 400 yuan, while the new shops set it at 398 yuan. The buy-back price was about 20 yuan less.</p>
<h3>British Pure Gold at 9 Pence</h3>
<p>A London dispatch on the 6th stated that British pure gold was at 9 pence, with each ounce costing 8 pounds and 8 shillings. The Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash remained at 1,370.09 yuan. The listed customs gold price remained at 1.707 yuan, and the Shanghai standard gold bar price also remained at 1,366.30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Drops 17.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange suddenly decreased. Initially, it was 165 yuan per thousand yuan, but it decreased to 155 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, it even dropped to 135 yuan before settling at 145 yuan, 17.5 yuan lower than the previous day. The money industry association's overnight lending rate was 20%, both in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<h3>Wild Fluctuations in U.S. Dollar; HSBC Lists at 5.875 Yuan; Black Market Reaches 6.125 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw HSBC list at 9:30 AM, reducing the British exchange rate by .25 and the U.S. exchange rate by a fraction. The British gold weight reached the low price of 3 pence 25 on August 26th. The U.S. exchange rate broke the tightest price of 6.0625 yuan on August 26th, creating a new high of 5.875 yuan. With the exception of the German exchange rate, which saw no market, the rest all declined in unison. The black market situation for British and U.S. exchanges was particularly volatile, with a wide range of fluctuations, all based on rumors in the market. It opened slightly soft, with the Nichigyo and Uli firms absorbing significant amounts. In addition, many foreign merchants were repatriating due to the war and settling exchange, coupled with the rumors of Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan forming an alliance, resulting in more buying than selling. It tightened to 3 pence 6875 for British gold and 6.125 yuan for the U.S. exchange. However, the sudden influx of peace rumors caused a shift to oversupply, leading to a tightening. In the afternoon, Hong Kong telegrams were unloaded, easing the rate to 3 pence 90625 and 6.625 yuan. However, Western merchants like Sassoon seized the opportunity to absorb it, causing it to tighten again. The closing price for British gold was 3 pence 84375, and the U.S. exchange was 6.5 yuan. The trend for September futures was the same as the spot market. The daily trading volume was very active. The result was an increase of 15625 for British gold and a decrease of .25 for U.S. exchange compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Reduced Absorption at Noon</h3>
<p>In the early morning, the London exchange rate was strong, with near-term rising sharply by 2 pence 625 and far-term rising violently by 2 pence 6875. New York silver prices increased by .75. London raw gold was at 9 pence. The exchange rate between Britain and the United States was unchanged. Shanghai against the British was .75 (no market), against the French was unchanged. The United States against Britain decreased by 1.5 cents, against Shanghai decreased by .45 yuan, against the French decreased by 1.25 cents. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price for British gold was 3 pence 96875, and the U.S. exchange was 6.6875 yuan, compared to the previous closing, Britain was tighter by 03125, and the U.S. exchange was softer by .0625. After opening, HSBC absorbed spot British gold at 4 pence from exporters. At that time, Chinese merchants were absorbing as well, but because external supply was very weak, and external banks like Uli and certain banks had very good appetites, the situation softened. When HSBC announced its exchange rates, British exchange decreased by .25, and the U.S. exchange violently decreased by .5 yuan, and the white silver balance tax was calculated at 11.25%. Afterwards, the market frequently reported positive news, and the Japanese bank and foreign merchants absorbed significantly, causing the market to tighten. It was calculated that a certain Japanese bank successively absorbed external spot British gold from 3 pence 875 to 75, and spot U.S. exchange from 6.4375 to 3125. Then, Uli absorbed Huayi's spot British gold at 3 pence 6875. At that time, foreign merchants settled through Datong with spot U.S. exchange at 6.1875 yuan. The tightest exchange ever quoted by a bank was 6.125 yuan. Suddenly, rumors of a certain peace atmosphere spread, and the absorption momentum stopped temporarily, and external supply turned better, causing a slight tightening. A certain bank sold spot U.S. exchange to Chinese merchants at 6.25 yuan. Extending into the afternoon, the bank's spot selling price for British gold had returned to 3 pence 75, and the U.S. exchange had also returned to 6.375 yuan, compared to the morning opening, Britain was 21875 tighter, and the U.S. exchange was 3125 softer.</p>
<h3>Sassoon Seizes the Opportunity to Absorb</h3>
<p>In the after market, the market trend continued to tighten due to sudden telegrams from Hong Kong. It was calculated that Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British gold to HSBC, Uli, and other foreign banks from 3 pence 8125 to 90625, and spot U.S. exchange from 6.5 yuan to 625. Afterwards, Sassoon suddenly came to absorb, and the situation reverted to softening. It was calculated that Sassoon absorbed external spot British gold at 3 pence 875 and 84375 from certain banks, and spot U.S. exchange at 6.5625 and .5 yuan. Extending to the late close, the bank's spot selling price for British gold was 3 pence 84375, and the U.S. exchange was 6.5 yuan.

<h3>Foreign Currency Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currency experienced extremely sudden fluctuations. It began with the new four-power axis of Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan reportedly forming an alliance, which caused greater unrest. The buying sentiment was particularly strong, and the U.S. dollar once rose to 15.9 yuan. However, the news of Sino-Japanese peace talks resurfaced, causing it to suddenly fall back to 14.56 yuan, eventually settling at 15 yuan, a rise of 45 fen compared to the previous day. The British gold pound rose by 1 yuan, the U.S. dollar rose by 3 yuan to a price of 98 yuan, the British pound bill rose by 1.5 yuan, the Hong Kong bill rose by 1 jiao, the Japanese gold bill's bullish trend expanded, rising by about 5 fen, the Korean bill rose by 2.7 li, but the French franc bill fell by 1 fen, the Annam bill fell by 1 jiao, and there were no other transactions.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Erratic Fluctuations in Domestic Debt Market; Active Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>The securities black market experienced significant fluctuations yesterday due to numerous rumors. The trend was entirely dictated by European news. However, news often reversed itself shortly after being received. Speculators alternately bought and sold, tiring themselves out. Generally speaking, the news was bad in the morning. Spot cash rose sharply, and government bonds softened. In the afternoon, there were suddenly positive rumors, and market prices turned higher. After the close, the rumor of an alliance between Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan resurfaced, along with peace rumors. Bullish investors had different opinions, and buying sentiment rose again. Class C shares rose as high as 44.2 yuan before falling back several jiao. Public sentiment was extremely chaotic, and it will be difficult to return to normalcy for the time being. Yesterday, Dingkang continued to sell, and Hongkang also inclined to sell. Only retail investors were slightly active. The noon closing was slightly down 2.4 jiao. In the afternoon, No. 25 and No. 56 and retail investors bought more. Hongkang continued to sell, and Lianyi also sold off, but it turned up by 5 to 8 jiao. Overall, it closed up 2 to 5 jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 800,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading saw 100 shares of Dasheng No. 3 Factory trade at a price of 15 yuan. The Public Chamber of Commerce's stock market report stated that trading remained very active. Rubber stocks were of interest. Though they seemed slow to respond to the recent surge in raw rubber and the easing of foreign exchange, the underlying strength had not weakened. Although the prices of various stocks mostly increased, the scope of trading was quite narrow. Some prices were lower than the morning's highs, and some even fell back, which can be seen as a sign of health. The market's progress and the orderly, peaceful movement are better than rapid and violent movements. Industrial stocks also trended upward. In the afternoon, prices were increasingly firm as the new trading week began. Ewo Cotton Mill stock remained prominent, with 27,000 shares traded.</p>
<p>New York Stocks: A New York dispatch on the 6th stated that the stock market was mixed with slight declines. Market analysts said that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had recently surged by 18%, so a reaction was normal and unsurprising. The price declines were quite orderly, with strong resistance at times. The volume of transactions decreased during the decline, which was reassuring to speculators. Steel stocks led the decline, but some of the losses were recovered before the close. The steel mill operating rate for the week declined due to the Labor Day holiday. It is forecast to increase to 65% next week. At the same time, the market is also paying attention to foreign demand, increased exports, and rising prices. The Dow Jones stock indices were not received.</p>
<h3>Low-Price Rice; Foreign Rice Arrives; Rice Market Full of Selling Sentiment; Indica and Japonica Rice Plunge by Two to Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the arrival of low-price foreign rice, the market sentiment weakened. The market was weak from the start of the morning session. However, the opening prices were still high. Japonica rice was still desired at 38 yuan. He Xia early and late rice was 34 yuan. Xin Jian was 30 yuan. However, because most of the local merchants were cautious, the market steadily declined. At the close, Japonica and Jian rice had fallen by two to three yuan each. Gao Xi japonica was 36 yuan, Su Tong japonica was 35 yuan, He Xia early and late rice was 32.3 to 32 yuan, original packaged rice was 34.5 to 33.8 yuan, Jia Shan Jia Xing Xin Chuan Jian was 27 yuan, Yang Tuan Jian was 29 to 28 yuan, Chen Jue Wu Jian was 26 yuan, Xin Jian was 27 yuan, Jiang Bei Xin Jian was 28 to 27.5 yuan. Total transaction volume was only four to five thousand bags. Sources from various regions, He Xia had not yet arrived. Only over three thousand bags of Che Lun Baozi had arrived.</p>
<p>Indica rice: Yesterday, sources continued to pour in. Over five thousand bags arrived via Che Lun. The number of Jiangbei Xin Xian rice arriving was relatively strong. There may be continuous arrivals. Furthermore, 18,000 bags of Saigon rice have already arrived. Market sentiment and prices uniformly declined. The market was full of selling sentiment, with price cuts to quickly unload. Therefore, the selling price of Xin Xian rice suddenly fell by about two yuan, and Chen Xian rice fell by a small yuan and a half. However, after the price decreased slightly, it attracted inquiries from local and suburban shops. Inland merchants also slightly increased their purchases. The after-market trading turned active, and the market stabilized slightly.</p>
<h3>Sudden Movement in Northern Sales; Flour Mill Prices Surge Two Jiao; Wheat Slightly Tightens</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, spot flour mill prices surged by two jiao, reaching 6.6 yuan in cash. This was due to a sudden movement in customer sales in North China. Northern merchants were in great need of lower-grade flour due to the Tianjin flood. They offered 4.5 yuan (cash) for Fufeng white bag flour, 5.4 yuan (cash) for Red Liu Hai flour, and the transaction volume of No. 2 flour and others was close to 100,000 bags. Local purchases were also higher than the previous day. Market sentiment was upward, and the market rose sharply. It was reported that the total number of cargo warehouse receipts currently circulating in the market was only 30,000 to 50,000 bags. The goods sold by the various mills must be delivered immediately. Therefore, the price of returned flour rose with the market, still higher than the mill price by about 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Wheat: Also improved. Chang Xi Jing Zhen sources were abundant. Mill purchases were not quiet either. It was also reported that the flour market's customer sales were active, and the mill price had increased by two jiao. Speculators also continued to buy, but the buying was limited, and the market was not easily improved. The result was a slight tightening. Speculators throughout the city purchased over ten truckloads, and Fuxin and Fufeng mills jointly purchased 7,500 to 7,600 bags. The highest price was 10 yuan and 8 fen, falling to 9.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Suspension of Coastal Defense Transport; Yarn Market Wants to Rise But Is Hindered</p>
<p>The yarn market started to calm down, and the trend slightly eased. The prices that had soared wildly in the past two days were already substantial, prompting some profit-takers to sell. As a result, the market turned calmer. However, those who had made money in exchange bills reorganized and came back to purchase, and the situation suddenly became tense. Therefore, market prices rose and fell, becoming more erratic. Currently, the yarn market should naturally rise due to the situation with foreign cotton, but there is a severe shortage of transport ships on all routes. The goods purchased by customers cannot be loaded, and the coastal defense, the only transportation hub connecting the mainland, has completely suspended operations.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened with a peaceful situation in the morning because the previous day's momentum had exploded. After a while, a certain major dealer came back to the market to absorb yarn, and it was reported that the black market foreign exchange had decreased again, and the price of gold had soared. The buying trend immediately started again. The spot price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn rose from 675 yuan to 700 yuan. The warehouse receipt price rose from 635 yuan to 648 yuan. By the time of closing, profit-takers sold off, and the price fell back by 15 yuan. According to statistics, the half-day transaction volume was 1,550 bales. The market price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn rose by 5 yuan, Mu Yang yarn rose by 5 yuan, Tian Nv yarn fell by 3 yuan, and Shuang Di Qiu yarn fell by 7 yuan. Today, 65 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Yantai. The amounts purchased by each trade group are listed as follows:</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the news that the black market foreign exchange rose slightly and the securities market rose back was unfavorable to the yarn market, and the momentum turned calm.</p>
<h3>Amidst Soaring Foreign Cotton Prices, Chinese and Foreign Cotton Trading Is Very Active</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading developed greatly, because overseas cotton prices rose uniformly, coupled with foreign exchange shrinkage, causing industry sentiment to be firm and transactions to be frequent. As for the yarn mills, Japanese merchants had a strong buying intent, because their cotton inventory was insufficient, and the market price of Japanese yarn also soared, so they replenished purchases from time to time. Indian cotton prices rose by another 6 yuan. According to industry insiders, Chinese factories such as Shenxin No. 29 Factory, Hongzhang, Xinyu, and Anda factories had ample storage and had no urgent need to purchase. The source of Xintong cotton has been slightly stagnant recently, and the selling price has risen daily. 450 bales arrived, and the asking price was 110 yuan. Yesterday, another 156 bales arrived, and the asking price was 115.6 yuan. 200 to 300 bales were traded. 60 bales of new cotton from Beisha and 250 pieces of foreign Pingguo er cotton of 10 count coarse yarn from Jiu Yuan Zhu Wen were traded at a price of 108.25 yuan. The opening prices for spot cotton sales are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Another message states that foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become active. In addition to Japanese factories already purchasing in large quantities, traders are also searching and purchasing from all directions, so the selling price is very firm and expensive. The selling price of Brazilian cotton is over 180 yuan, and American cotton of 42 counts is being offered at over 120 yuan, and the seller is unwilling to sell. Therefore, it is predicted that cotton prices will rise across the board if there are no changes in the political situation in all regions.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market telegram did not arrive yesterday, but according to a private telegram, the cotton market was quite active yesterday due to the unusually firm sentiment and rising stock market prices. It opened and rose by over 10 pounds, and the cotton price was consistently very firm due to the speculator's aggressive purchases. The result of the closing price was a rise of 25 pounds compared to the previous day. The Liverpool cotton market was flat. India had been rising sharply for consecutive days, but it had become calmer yesterday, and the forecast rose by 1 rupee. Egypt rose by over 20 pounds.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Dyeing Costs Are About To Increase; White Goods Trading Is Very Active</p>
<p>Yesterday the market situation was still good. Wenzhou merchants have special ships for trial voyages within days, and demand has suddenly increased. The local colored cloth shops, because the dyeing costs in dyeing factories are about to increase greatly, Dong Pi rises and increases very quickly, the national cloth is relatively cheaper, so continuous absorption has been strong for consecutive days, and they are rushing to dye early and store goods for sale, so the selling price has been raised uniformly again. White goods, fine cloth, and coarse cloth rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half per bolt. Colored cloth and colored twill rose by 2 jiao to 5 jiao per bolt. The local market traded over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, colored twill, broadcloth, and flannel. Wenzhou merchants purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill from Yihua and other factories.</p>
<p>Dong Pi</p>
<p>The morning market's bullish trend continued, and the high price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was called at 19.5 yuan per bolt. Merchants also opened orders from foreign firms for fine cloth and fine twill, totaling about 1,000 pieces. The market price of five-width fine cloth was set at 17.5 yuan, Shanghai color ball was 19.35 yuan, and Flying Fish fine cloth was 19 yuan, all higher than the current market. In the afternoon, public sentiment was weak due to rumors from all sides, and the market price fell back. The doing price of Dragon Head fine cloth was 19 yuan, but the demand for dyed fine twill remained strong, and it was still 2.5 jiao higher per bolt compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>195 pieces of piece goods were transported to Yantai on the 8th, and 3 pieces were transported to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Sugar Prices Keep Rising</p>

<h3>Caolu Visits British and French Naval Officers, Frequent Contacts in Diplomatic Circles, British Association in China Vows Loyalty to Motherland, French Ambassador's Wife Forms Women's慰劳团</h3>
<p>The European war has been erupting for nearly a week. This port, being a gathering place for Chinese and foreigners, has shown some signs of stagnation in business in China due to the conscription for military service and the enthusiastic participation of nationals from various countries. Diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in Shanghai have been visiting each other frequently in recent days. The Japanese naval representative visited the British and French naval authorities to state his country's position. Madame Gosselin, the French ambassador's wife, is organizing a French侨妇女慰劳团 (comfort group). Regarding the transportation of passengers and goods between Europe and Asia, it has been learned that British ships have temporarily changed their routes, while Italian ships have increased freight rates. Swiss ships, adhering strictly to neutrality, refuse to carry people from belligerent countries. The details of these situations are as follows:</p>
<p>Caolu Visits British and French Officers</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Caolu, Chief of Staff of the Japanese China Fleet, visited the British and French naval commanders the day before yesterday afternoon, representing Commander Oikawa of the Japanese China Fleet in stating his country's position on the European war situation. Consul General Miura of Japan also visited the consuls general of Britain, France, and Germany on the same day to make certain statements. It is reported that the diplomatic activities of Japanese military and political personnel stationed in Shanghai are receiving unanimous attention from all parties.</p>
<p>British Association Holds Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Association of the British Association in China, in response to the expansion of the European war and Britain's declaration of war on Germany, convened an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss the attitude and steps to be taken in the future and how to seek mutual communication. It was decided to send representatives to consult with the British authorities stationed in Shanghai. According to the North China Daily News, the General Committee of the British Association in China held a special meeting on Tuesday to review the situation in this port caused by the European declaration of war and recorded the association's willingness to act in accordance with the instructions of the British authorities at any time.</p>
<p>French Ambassador's Wife Organizes Comfort Group</p>
<p>Madame Gosselin, the wife of the French Ambassador to China, believing that women should also serve their country during the European war, is leading the French women residing in Shanghai to organize a women's comfort group to慰劳 (comfort) the soldiers participating in the war. It has been decided to hold the first preparatory meeting at 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 12th of this month (Tuesday) at 151 Rue du Père Robert to collect绒衫 (woolen sweaters), 短衫 (short shirts), 裤袜 (trousers and socks), and other comfort items to be shipped back to the motherland to reward the soldiers. The collection point is located at No. 23, Lane 753, Route Haig. The Shanghai Evening Post reports that Madame Gosselin, the French Ambassador to China, is inviting French women and friends of France in Shanghai to participate in a working group under her patronage to knit short socks and other necessary woolen garments to慰劳 (comfort) French soldiers. The association will meet on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday afternoons at the Jardin de Ste. Thérèse on Avenue Haig.</p>
<p>Swire's Ships Paint Over Names</p>
<p>The shipping lines of various countries in this city have now returned to normal. However, in response to the emergency situation, Swire &amp; Co., a British company, has painted over the British flags and the words "British Merchant Ship" on both sides of its ships, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that in addition to painting over the flags and words, the copper English ship names and place of manufacture at both ends of the bow and below the stern have also been painted over. However, the Chinese ship names in the middle of the hull and the English ship name glass lamps on both sides of the second-floor platform have not been removed. They may also be removed if necessary.</p>
<p>Arrival and Departure Schedules Not Publicly Announced</p>
<p>The company also took special measures yesterday, canceling the daily issued ship arrival and departure schedules from today onwards. The dates of arrival and departure of ships will be kept strictly confidential. Although this move can avoid the attention of the enemy, it will cause many inconveniences in terms of business, as passengers planning to book cargo and travelers purchasing tickets will not be able to know the ship schedules in advance, which may have a considerable impact. The company's ship "Taiyuan," originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong and Haiphong tomorrow morning, is now expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th and will depart on the morning of the 12th, still heading to Hong Kong and Haiphong. It was previously reported that the Haiphong authorities, under the order of French protectorate, prohibited the import of goods, but there is no such news in the shipping industry. How it actually is remains to be verified.</p>
<p>Italian Mega Mail Ship to Depart the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Italian mail ship "Giulio Cesare" (i.e., "Ru Lian Gai Sa"), which was stranded in this city due to the European situation, docked at the Texas Pier. Now that the country has declared temporary neutrality, the ship has received a telegram from the head office to return to Europe. Therefore, it returned from the Texas Pier to the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to load goods. It was originally scheduled to depart today. According to the company yesterday, the passenger and cargo procedures could not be completed in time, so it had to be postponed for two days and is now scheduled to depart at 5:00 AM on the 10th. Passengers must board the ship on the evening of the 9th. The time of the last passenger launch has not yet been determined, but it will probably depart from the Custom House Wharf at 10:00 PM on the evening of the 9th.</p>
<p>French Ship "Yangtze" Changes Course</p>
<p>The French company's irregular ship "Yangtze" arrived in Shanghai on the 5th and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. It was originally scheduled to go to Japan this morning. According to the company, the ship has now changed its course and will not go to Japan, but will temporarily stay in Shanghai and plans to return to Europe. The exact date of departure is currently being requested from the head office. According to the scheduled timetable, it will return to Europe from Shanghai on the 18th of this month, but as the scheduled date is still far away, it may depart earlier.</p>
<p>Swiss Ships Refuse to Carry Nationals of Belligerent Countries</p>
<p>German ships on the coast of China and in the ports of the Yangtze River, Ningbo, and Ou River are still sailing as usual with difficulty and have not suffered any accidents. The three ships "Moufuk," "Haifuk," and "Hanna" are currently docked in the waters of Ningbo. Rumors that the North German company's ship "Xianghuosituo" was detained during its voyage have been confirmed by the company to be untrue, as the ship arrived in Kobe several days ago. Swiss commercial ships operating between Europe and Asia, due to the country's declared neutrality, will refuse to allow nationals of belligerent countries to board their ships in the future.</p>
<p>First Sealing and Dispatch of Airmail Since the War</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Society learned from the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday that airmail to European countries is being sealed and dispatched as usual. The first batch of airmail since the outbreak of the European war was sealed and dispatched yesterday, loaded onto ships and transported to Hong Kong, where it will be carried by Royal Airways aircraft, via Bangkok, Singapore, Australia, to London, and is expected to arrive in Marseille in six days and London in seven days. Subsequently, it is stipulated that every Monday by French Airlines, Tuesday by United Airlines, Wednesday by Dutch Airlines, and Friday by United Airlines, Shanghai will seal and dispatch at 12:00 noon daily, loaded onto ships and transported to Hong Kong for transshipment.</p>
<p>Large Batch of European Mail Loaded Onto Ships Yesterday</p>
<p>As for mail to European countries, such as ordinary, registered, and express letters, the number of deliveries has been quite crowded in recent days. However, due to the outbreak of the European war, overseas postal transportation is not without difficulties, and with the reduction in flights, the delivery time is longer than before. However, the Postal Administration has decided to maintain the status quo and continue to collect and send mail as usual until orders are received. It is learned that a large batch of European mail was loaded onto the "Giulio Cesare" yesterday and transported via the Suez Canal, arriving in London on October 5th. Yesterday morning, a large batch of European mail arrived on the "Bangge Nu" ship from Europe and has now been delivered by the Postal Administration according to addresses. It is also stipulated that the "Kang Tiebian Kamanno" ship will be loaded on September 13th and transported via the Suez Canal, arriving in London on October 12th, and the "Luchang Maru" ship will be loaded on September 15th and transported via the Pacific Ocean, arriving in London on October 17th.</p>
<h3>British and French Troops Will Not Withdraw, Concessions Remain As Peaceful As Ever, Rumors of New Demands from the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>The Japanese government requested the diplomatic representatives of Britain, France, Russia, and Germany stationed in Tokyo on the 5th to withdraw their troops in China to avoid accidents. The day before yesterday, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, visited the consuls of Britain, France, and Germany to verbally request that the belligerent countries carefully consider and avoid unfortunate incidents in China. Diplomatic circles generally believe that these two actions are</p>
<p>the same nature</p>
<p>But on the 6th, the embassy and army and navy spokespersons did not clearly state the requests and suggestions of the Japanese government at the reception for reporters, only stating three points: (1) The belligerent countries must avoid unfortunate frictions in China; (2) The detailed content cannot be released due to government orders; (3) The Japanese Navy has the right to adopt</p>
<p>necessary steps</p>
<p>However, the content of the steps is not allowed to be disclosed. According to reporters, the Japanese side merely requested the belligerent countries to avoid conflicts in China, intending to have Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in Shanghai. However, British officials believe that there are</p>
<p>within China</p>
<p>There are no German troops, and the situation in the two concessions is not tense at present. It is generally believed that there is no need for British and French vehicles to withdraw in fact, so there is no need to reply to the verbal requests made by the Japanese side to the British consul. Also, yesterday</p>
<p>rumors on the outside</p>
<p>The Public Concession Authority was requested to: (1) Hand over the police power of the extra-mural roads west of Yidingpan Road and Difeng Road; (2) Hand over the local court in the First Special Zone, which the authorities categorically denied yesterday.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Urges Expatriates, Each With Unwavering Faith, The Last War Must Be Won, Future Children Can Rest in Their Cradles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that French Ambassador Gosselin received the French expatriates in Shanghai at his residence at noon yesterday (6th) and delivered a speech stating, "I expect every Frenchman to do his duty to the end. This is an example of the patriotism of the French. The British and French governments have done their best to stop the outbreak of war, but they have not been able to stop it due to the cunning attitude of the German government." Ambassador Gosselin then stated the extent to which the two democratic governments</p>
<p>Prevented a Great War</p>
<p>He talked about the outbreak, and also involved two telegrams he received from Paris explaining the overall situation, and also said that even after the German army had been dispatched, the British and French ambassadors to Germany still visited the German Foreign Minister to request Germany to stop its actions. Germany did not take any action on this request. As a result, France</p>
<p>Declared war on Germany</p>
<p>France will fight with all its strength, courage and honor. My generation had hoped that France would not go to war again, but these events have made it clear that France can immediately go from dream to reality. I can guarantee to you that we will</p>
<p>Fight and win</p>
<p>Because this time must be the last war, so we must win. We must make sure that future children can rest safely in their cradles, progress should outweigh destruction, and people should be free. I am now speaking with a spirit of great confidence. Long live France." Ambassador Gosselin continued to</p>
<p>Soon Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>Speaking to the French expatriates serving in the army, he said that they all eagerly wanted to go to serve the country, and the authorities were making the fastest and most proper transportation arrangements. Ambassador Gosselin asked the French expatriates staying in Shanghai to devote themselves to fate, but remember that their obedience to orders can provide the best service to the country.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Open Fire, Four Chinese Shot, One Killed</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday, someone saw Japanese troops shooting four Chinese near the bridge on Gimmei Road. The Japanese troops fired three shots in total. One person was shot and died on the spot, lying in a pool of blood in the grass. Two people were injured in the chest and legs and were in critical condition.

<h3>Last Batch of Jews Arriving in Shanghai, Allowed to Land, Municipal Council, etc. Meeting to Decide</h3>
<p>Regarding how to deal with the issue of Jewish refugees coming to Shanghai later, the Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the French Consul, the Japanese Consul, and representatives of the Jewish Refugee Association met again on the 6th to discuss everything. It is learned that the 900 Jewish refugees who have decided to come to Shanghai will be carried by Italian ships. Since no more refugees will come to Shanghai other than these 900, the parties concerned decided as a result of the discussion to allow them to land in Shanghai. As for the arrangements after arriving in Shanghai, they will be discussed at a later date.</p>
<h3>Xu Yefu and Nie Haifan Assassinated Yesterday, Both Died of Serious Injuries, None of the Murderers Have Been Apprehended</h3>
<p>Within the Public Concession this week, since the shooting of Wu Zhiqian, the principal of Shanghai Women's Middle School, occurred on Monday (4th), and she died of her serious injuries, the Concession Police Authority immediately took urgent measures and strictly investigated the murderer. Unexpectedly, just three days later, two more shootings occurred on the same day yesterday. The news spread, and there was a lot of discussion. The victims of the two cases were Xu Yefu, the former section chief of the Second Section of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, who was recuperating at the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai, and Nie Haifan, the principal of Da Hai Middle School at No. 1456 Jing'an Temple Road and the director of the Reception Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch. Both died of serious injuries, and the murderers escaped. The details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Yefu</p>
<p>Xu was from Tiantai, Zhejiang Province, and was 40 years old. Before the Shanghai War, he served as the section chief of the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and a member of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters. When the Chinese army retreated westward and the administrative institutions were disbanded, Xu retired to his hometown and did not ask about foreign affairs. In the middle of last month, Xu was suffering from alternating chills and fever in his hometown, so he took a boat to Shanghai to seek medical treatment at Xiaoshadu Road on August 21st</p>
<p>Labor Hospital</p>
<p>And lived in ward 14 of the hospital. For more than ten days, the illness has gradually recovered, unexpectedly, at about one and a half last morning, he was suddenly heard to be shot. At that time, it was midnight, and everyone in the hospital was dreaming. Among them, there was a night nurse who suddenly heard</p>
<p>Two gunshots</p>
<p>He came from Xu's room and was very frightened. He rushed to check and saw that Xu was covered in blood and unconscious. It was also found that Xu's body had been shot twice. One shot went in from the lower jaw, and the bullet came out from the tip of the nose. A bullet entered from the left eyebrow, and the bullet did not come out, and the murderer had already escaped. The hospital often reported to the police station and immediately sent a large number of</p>
<p>Armed Detectives</p>
<p>Arrived to investigate. After checking, Xu Yefu was transferred to the Bao Long Hospital for treatment. It was said that his life was in danger. After the detectives investigated, they found that the patient in ward 11 next door had also suddenly disappeared, and the window facing the wall was open, with a blue cloth hanging down, which was obviously the murderer who had</p>
<p>Escaped over the Wall</p>
<p>It was found that the patient in ward 11 was Liu Yong, from Ningbo, 32 years old, living at No. 64 Roberts Road. On the 3rd of this month, he went to the hospital to ask a doctor to diagnose him, saying that he was suffering from indigestion, constipation, and insomnia. After the doctor diagnosed him, he considered it to be</p>
<p>neurasthenia</p>
<p>Immediately prescribed a prescription and left. On the 4th, Liu came to the hospital again, requesting to stay in the hospital for treatment, and chose ward 12. The doctor did not know anything else and allowed him to be hospitalized. Liu was wearing yellow leather shoes and a beige suit. His hospitalization diagnosis number was 277. After the incident, the police station, in addition to strictly arresting the murderer and bringing him to justice, is also investigating the truth in detail.</p>
<p>Nie Haifan</p>
<p>Nie Haifan, principal of Da Hai Middle School and director of the Reception Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch, was shot five times at Da Hai Middle School at 2:00 PM yesterday (7th) and died of serious injuries. It was found that Nie was assigned by the Social Affairs Bureau to handle Shanghai refugee relief work after the 813 Incident, and has been working tirelessly for</p>
<p>Refugee Relief</p>
<p>His efforts have been highly praised by the Standing Bureau of the Relief Association. Nie has been serving in the Social Affairs Bureau for many years and has considerable experience in running education. He then founded</p>
<p>Da Hai Middle School</p>
<p>At the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hardoon Road last winter, he also served as the director of the Reception Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch. Since its establishment, Da Hai Middle School has been developing well. Nie has recently focused on running the school and has appointed an agent for the affairs of the Reception Group of the Relief Association. At 2:00 PM yesterday, he was in the principal's office at Da Hai Middle School,</p>
<p>Suddenly Comes a Stranger</p>
<p>One person took out a pistol and fired five shots at Nie, who died on the spot. Nie was very kind and amiable in his daily dealings with people and focused on running charity and school affairs. The reason for the shooting this time is unknown.</p>
<p>Nie's resume is as follows: Nie was from Yuanjiang, Hunan, 31 years old, graduated from the Department of Political Economy of China Public School, and served in the Chen Pao Hall, Municipal Education Bureau, and Social Affairs Bureau, sparing no effort in running cultural education. After the 813 Incident, he was assigned to the Municipal Relief Committee and also participated in the Disaster Relief Association of Charity Organizations, and was elected as a member of the association and director of the Reception Group. Last winter, he founded Da Hai Middle School and was in the process of struggling to operate it. Unexpectedly, he was assassinated. His family is still in his hometown of Hunan. His mother, wife, and a son have not yet heard the news. Nie's remains will be embalmed at 2:00 PM today (8th) at the Dazhong Funeral Parlor at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Xichangping Road. His friends in his lifetime will go to take care of the funeral affairs.</p>

<h3>US Fleet Commander-in-Chief Hertoff to Qingdao This Morning, Came to Shanghai to Meet Commander Grassford, His Hasty Departure Is Particularly Noteworthy</h3>
<p>After Admiral Hertoff, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, came to Shanghai to take up his post, he had been cruising in North China for a month. After the outbreak of the European war, he suddenly arrived in Shanghai on the 6th afternoon from North China on Commander Hertoff's private fast ship "Isabel". He met with Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet. Regarding the fleet movements of the US side, rumors in this port that Commander Hertoff had met with Japanese officials to talk, the US side denied this. After meeting with Commander Glassford, Commander Hertoff also met with foreign naval officers. Commander Hertoff is waiting to handle important public affairs in North China, and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the original ship for Qingdao this morning. If he does not leave in the morning, he will leave Shanghai at noon. According to Hertoff, after coming to Shanghai on July 25th to take over as Commander-in-Chief, he only stayed in Shanghai for a week, and then cruised in the Qinhuangdao area of North China on the Augusta flagship on the afternoon of August 3rd. lasting more than a month, and has been cruising in North China. While in North China, Commander Hertoff once met with Admiral Nobel, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Navy. Commander Hertoff's hasty departure is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Moon Approaching Earth, Another High Tide, Warehouses and Buildings Weigh Heavily, Ground Subsidence Will Inevitably Cause Water to Rise</h3>
<p>According to the prediction of the Junpu Bureau, there will be another high tide in the Huangpu River starting on the 14th. Because the moon is close to the earth, the tide level is particularly high. It is predicted that the quantity of the morning tide on that day will be 11 feet 8.2 inches, the noon tide will be 11 feet 8 inches, the morning tide on the 15th will be 12 feet 3.2 inches, the noon tide will be 12 feet 2.4 inches, the morning tide on the 16th will be one foot 8.5 inches, the noon tide one foot 8.7 inches, the morning tide on the 17th will be 11 feet 3 inches, the noon tide will be 11 feet 8 inches, the morning tide on the 18th will be 10 feet 0.93 inches, the noon tide will be 11 feet 1.6 inches, the morning tide on the 19th will be 9 feet 4.2 inches, and the noon tide will be 10 feet 0.34 inches. Among the high tides in the above six days, the tide on the 15th is the highest, only a few inches away from the bund revetment. Therefore, the tide may come ashore at that time, and the current is turbulent at the same time, reaching 2.4 nautical miles per hour. Also, Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, and Yinghua Street are commercial center areas, and the buildings are towering. Gansu Road, Wenjisi Tor Road, and other places are concentrated locations for warehouses and stacking, and the pressure is very heavy. Therefore, most of the ground has sunk, and it is inevitable that they will be troubled by the tide water rising from the sewers during the tidal period.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Line German Ships Sailing As Usual, No Order to Ban Sailing, Moufuk Expected to Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the general public in Shanghai who are from Ningbo have been quite concerned about whether the German ships on the line are still sailing as usual. A reporter from Dagang Society specifically asked the Moufuk wheel business office of Lihe Foreign Company's shipping department yesterday. It was said that the ship had not received any order from the German Consulate General to ban sailing. The reason why it has been stationed outside the Zhenhai estuary for a long time is because it has to wait for the first ship to arrive and unload in turn. We have just received a telegram saying that the ship only started unloading imported goods on the 5th, and it has not been completed yet. After unloading, it will load export goods, which will take until the 10th to complete at the fastest. Therefore, it is expected to leave Zhenhai and return to Shanghai on the 11th, and will continue to travel back and forth as before. As for the Haifuk ship's decision to open Yong, it is still a few days after Moufuk, so its return to Shanghai will also be later. It was found that the extension of its schedule was due to the restriction of the Ningbo authorities on the anchorage of the navigation wheels, and the same is true for British and Italian wheels. It is also learned that the Hanna wheel of the German Far East Company is also scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 15th and sail as usual.</p>
<h3>Japanese Association Opposes Electricity Fee Increase</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that, according to Japanese newspapers, the Shanghai Japanese Road Association has recently organized a special committee to oppose the Shanghai Electric Power Company's increase in electricity fees by 120%. The Standing Committee of the Association stated that the increase in electricity fees is "illegal." The Standing Committee is also paying close attention to the development of rice price situations.</p>
<h3>Black Market Foreign Exchange Recedes, Bond Prices Firm, Foreign Exchange Retreats for No Real Reason, Gold Rises with Block Coal Market Prices Look High</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange black market shrunk again yesterday morning, with the British firm HSBC Bank listing British exchange at three and a half pence and US exchange at five yuan and eight hundred and seventy-five, and the actual market price of British exchange at three and eighty-four thousand three hundred and seventy-five pence and US exchange at six and a half yuan. Generally speculators on the market scrambled to get in, causing the exchange rate to shrink sharply. As for foreign currency transactions, they rose sharply accordingly.

<h3>German Nationals Rush to Retrieve Goods Stored in British Warehouses; Confiscation Unlikely to Be Implemented Immediately; British Consulate Instructs on Proper Procedures</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Da Mei Wanbao" (North China Daily Mail), many German nationals in this city have furniture and goods stored in the warehouses of the British company "Beauty Arts Company." This morning (yesterday), they went to the Jing'an Temple Road office of Beauty Arts Company to retrieve their stored goods. Although there were rumors in the city that the goods of German nationals would not be returned, the company returned the stored goods to German nationals who settled their accounts. An employee of the company strongly denied the rumor that the goods of German nationals had been confiscated. He stated that the company would return all goods to anyone who had paid their warehouse storage fees. However, some British wharves and warehouses, in accordance with the "Trading with the Enemy" regulations announced by the British Embassy a few days ago, do not allow German goods stored in their warehouses to be moved out. It is heard that this regulation, announced by the British Embassy due to the European war, has not yet been enacted into law, so British businesses may temporarily decide for themselves. It is understood that this regulation is only a preliminary warning, providing general guidance for British businesses. A committee has been established in the British Consulate General, meeting daily to provide instructions on difficult issues encountered by British businesses in Shanghai and other ports. Many British businesses have sent letters or orally inquired with the committee. According to an official who spoke to a reporter today, some British businesses hold German property, which is clearly detrimental to themselves. For example, goods that have little value to the enemy in the context of the war continue to occupy valuable storage space if they are not allowed to be moved out.</p>

<h3>Tribute Rice Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Sale at Subsidized Prices to Begin in Days; Temporarily Stored in Zhongyi and Fuxin Warehouses; Purchase of Subsidized Rice Limited to Two Yuan Per Person</h3>
<p>The 18,000 bags (1,800 tons) of foreign rice ordered from Saigon by Yu Qiaqing and others were transported by the Norwegian merchant vessel "Haida," an agent of the Hualun Foreign Firm, and entered the Wusongkou at 4:30 PM yesterday. It arrived in Shanghai at 6:00 PM and docked at the Bund pier on Beijing Road. Unloading is scheduled to begin today, with 10,000 bags to be used by the Refugee Relief Association to help refugees. It is planned to temporarily store 8,319 bags in the Zhongyi warehouse and 10,000 bags in the Fuxin warehouse. In the future, 8,000 bags will be handed over to the Rice Merchant Guild for sale at subsidized prices. The Ministry of Finance has ordered the Inspector General of Customs to allow the tax-free import of this foreign rice, and the Foreign Exchange Review Committee has provided a foreign exchange of £10,000 at the official exchange rate of 7 pence per dollar.</p>
<p>Sale at Subsidized Prices Measures Have Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Zhang Nianxuan, chairman of the Shanghai Rice Merchant Guild, consulted with Yu Qiaqing the day before yesterday on measures for subsidized rice sales, and the following was agreed upon: (1) Five subsidized sales locations will be set up in the two concessions, designating three rice stores in the Public Concession and two rice stores in the French Concession. It is said that contacts have been made with the Jade Buddha Temple and the Quanzhang Guild Hall, etc.; (2) The price will be in accordance with the Public Concession's price limit, at 20 yuan per stone, or 2 jiao per shi sheng; (3) Each person is limited to purchasing 2 yuan of subsidized rice. The staff at the subsidized sales locations will be dispatched by the Rice Merchant Guild. At that time, the concession authorities will be requested to send detectives to provide protection. At the same time, rice prices in this city fell yesterday, with top-quality Changbang rice falling to 36 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>Negotiations to Continue for Further Orders of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The Accountants Guild accepted the entrustment of various groups to handle the registration of orders for foreign rice. Yesterday, 350 bags were registered, bringing the total to 5,136 bags. Once a substantial quantity has been registered, the initiators will convene a meeting of all those who have placed orders, and then telegraph Saigon to place further orders, and elect custodians. However, those placing orders must pay at least 50% of the price when placing the order, with the remainder to be paid according to the final price. The collection of payments will be entrusted to a bank. It is heard that if the government approves the exchange rate for ordering foreign rice at the official exchange rate, it will cost 20 yuan per stone in national currency. If it is at the Shanghai black market exchange rate, it will definitely be more than this amount.</p>

According to inquiries at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, from the 1st of this month to the day before yesterday, the hospital has discovered as many as 513 dysentery patients in six days, the number of which is rare in recent years. According to Dr. Deng Qingshan, the medical director of the hospital, dysentery is caused by improper diet and spreads rapidly. Therefore, he urges residents of this city to pay attention to their health and avoid gluttony in order to prevent the disease.</p>
<p>The cholera epidemic in this city has not yet subsided. According to a report released yesterday by the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, 11 new cases of true cholera have been discovered in the last three days: Jiang Meichang, living at 78 Qipu Road; Dai Wusheng, living at 206, Alley 33, South Chengdu Road; Fan Ada, living at the Zilaihuo Bank at Xin Laji Bridge; Jiang Chunyi, living at 60 Dagu Road; Yao Yu, living at 288 Shiyunli, Pingjili Road; Chen Xingrong, living at 46 Qingrenli, Haige Road; Yuan Linlin, living at Cilinli, Tianhougong Bridge; He Aqing, living on the Tongde Steamboat, North Shanxi Road; Gao Zhangde, living at 608 Juxiangda Road; Gao Xinglin, living at 81 Wuma Road; and Liu Jinfang, living at the First Reception Center, Dunxin Road.</p>

<h3>Male Corpse Found Murdered on Dahua Road This Morning; Four Axe Wounds on the Body; Seems Like the Body Was Moved There After Death</h3>
<p>At about 0:10 this morning, a man in his thirties was found murdered on Dahua Road near the back of the Da Metropolitan Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road. Someone from the dance hall immediately telegraphed the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. They found the deceased had a gold tooth. He was wearing a blue striped silk short shirt and pants, a white undershirt, and black shoes, but no socks. There were four axe wounds on his body: one on his head, one on his left hand, one on his right shoulder, and one on his right waist. Because the cuts were very deep, the large intestine had flowed out. Judging from his appearance, he seemed to be of middle class. What was strange was that there was not much blood around the corpse, nor were there any messy footprints. According to general speculation, it seems that this person had already fallen asleep before he was murdered, and the murderer moved the body to that location. The police station has now sent the body to the coroner's office and is starting to investigate clues. Relatives of the deceased are also encouraged to come and identify the body in the hope of uncovering the truth.</p>

<h3>Woman Requests Difficult Marriage; Husband Demands Cohabitation; Judge Advises Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Wang Yiche (age 30, formerly a teacher), the son of Wang Junshan (hao Zhiyi) from Jiading, recently filed a lawsuit for divorce in the civil division of the Special No. 2 Court through his wife, Wang Yan Shaolin (age 26, also from Jiading), represented by lawyer Jiang Zongpan. The reason stated was that in recent years, her husband has been wandering outside, having affairs with women, and developing addictions, neglecting the plaintiff's livelihood. He wrote a letter of repentance but did not repent. She requested that the court order him to compensate her for the violation money of 10,000 yuan as stated in the letter of repentance, and to return clothing and other items. After receiving the complaint, the court once held a hearing presided over by Judge Ma Yishu. The defendant appointed lawyer Cai Liucheng to appear on his behalf and opposed the divorce. The hearing was postponed to wait for the defendant himself to appear in court for questioning. This information has already been reported in this newspaper. This case was heard again in the Civil Division 7 yesterday morning by Judge Yu Changzi. Both the plaintiff and the defendant arrived in court with their lawyers. The court first questioned the plaintiff, Wang Yan Shaolin, about her reasons for requesting a divorce, and then questioned the defendant, Wang Yiche. He admitted to writing the letter of repentance, but said it was a compromise to appease her. As for the mistress, he had already broken up with her two or three years ago. As for his addiction, he occasionally smoked opium to treat his stomach illness, but he has now quit for two years. He said that the plaintiff's attitude changed after she started working at the Zhongde Hospital, and she did not often return home. He repeatedly wrote letters asking her to come home, but she ignored them. He suspected that there was an ulterior motive behind her current lawsuit for divorce. After examining the statements, the court earnestly advised both parties not to be contentious and to reconcile. Otherwise, the case would eventually conclude with one party suffering a loss. However, the plaintiff insisted that the defendant had repeatedly lied and could not be trusted. If they were to reconcile, the defendant would have to pay 50 yuan per month for living expenses. The defendant said that he was currently unemployed due to the national crisis and could only afford a maximum of 20 yuan per month for the plaintiff's expenses, so a reconciliation could not be reached. As it was past noon, the court ordered both parties to consider reconciliation outside the court and postponed the hearing for one week, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Two Opium Trafficking Cases Concluded with Sentencing</h3>

She confessed that she was instigated by Zhao Xixi, a comedian, so the police arrested Zhao as well. This information has already been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing of the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court continued the trial. Zhao consistently denied having instigated the crime, claiming that Zhang had falsely accused her. Zhang's testimony was evasive, saying that although Zhao did not directly defraud her of the five dou of white rice, she was ultimately harmed by Zhao, as if she had something difficult to say. The court asked if she had an affair with Zhao. Zhang replied that there was no need to say. Later, after the lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Fan Gangyuenliang, representing the police station and Zhao respectively, presented their cases, the court sentenced Zhang to 30 days of detention and acquitted Zhao Xixi.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Has Two More Pitfalls; Mainland Gambling Dens Continue as Usual; Yuan Road Zhaofeng Gambling Den Opens</h3>
<p>A few people, including a Mr. Ma, have pooled a large amount of money and rented the former residence of a Western bigwig on Weihaiwei Road to serve as a club, named "Mainland." Its internal structure is the same as the gambling parlors in West Shanghai. Since its active preparations, it once faced the issue of opening with a notification and almost ran aground. It is now learned that it is proceeding as usual and will open on schedule. The Zhaofeng Gambling Den, a new large-scale establishment, recently opened opposite Zhaofeng Park in West Shanghai. Its shareholders are a few people from Guangdong, including Liang Pei, and they have appointed Ye A'hua as the manager. The total capital is 50,000 yuan. It faces Hollywood from afar, competing with it for a day's worth of business. On the day of the official opening the day before yesterday, someone mischievously played a trick. Just as the gamblers were in high spirits, the light switch suddenly broke, plunging the entire parlor into darkness. This happened twice in a row, causing all the gamblers to be terrified. Some unscrupulous people took the opportunity to loot, and it is said that some gamblers' funds were completely stolen.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education Banning Unauthorized Establishment of Middle Schools; Relocation of Address Also Requires Approval</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Fangyan) The Zhejiang Provincial Government has stipulated that the establishment, alteration, or relocation of all middle schools must be approved by the Department of Education before they can be carried out. Without approval, schools must not recruit students without authorization. Recently, some newly established schools in various counties have not followed the regulations. The Department of Education has taken measures to ban them separately. In the future, if any secondary schools or branch schools, or high school and junior high school practice schools, are established without approval from the Department, or if they are relocated to other places for enrollment, the county should immediately investigate and ban them in accordance with regulations, it is said.</p>

<h3>First Charity Tennis Match: Handicap Final Changed to Charity Match; To Be Held at 3 PM Next Saturday; Famous Players Such as Lin Baohua Invited to Participate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Open Tennis Handicap Tournament, organized by the Shanghai Tennis Club, has been going on for three weeks since its opening. In Group A, only Wang Wenzheng, Li Guofan, and Zhang Dingzhao remain eligible for the final. The competition committee plans to hold the Group A final at 3 PM on the 15th of this month (Friday). It has also sought the consent of Mr. Yuan Ludeng, secretary of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, to use this competition as an opportunity to expand it into a charity tennis match. Famous players such as Lin Baohua, Wang Wenzheng, Zhang Dingjian, Li Guofan, Tang Baojia, Liang Deguang, and Xu Chengwei have been invited to join and perform in singles and doubles matches. Tickets will be sold for 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 3 yuan, and 1 yuan. The proceeds from the sale will be used by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to provide relief to refugees, so that tennis players and spectators can benefit the thousands of refugees in this city. It is reported that in addition to the competition committee members Chen Qihao and Chen Qijun presiding over the competition, all fundraising work and the responsibility for collecting and delivering donations will be handled by Li Ziyang, a staff member assigned by the Refugee Relief Association. It has been found that sports enthusiasts in this city have already been separately engaged in relief work for refugees in major and minor soccer, basketball, and table tennis matches, with considerable success. However, the tennis community has not yet made any significant contribution. This charity match promoted by the competition committee is a win-win situation. It concerns the relief of refugees and is an unprecedented charitable act, for which they have an unshirkable responsibility. Mr. Chen Qihao has drafted the following order, which is full of competitive interest:</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng vs. Lin Baohua (Singles)</p>
<p>Xu Chengwei vs. Liang Deguang (Singles)</p>
<p>Li Guofan—Wang Wenzheng</p>
<p>Tang Baojia—Liang Deguang</p>

<h3>An Opportunity to Make a Foreign Fortune?</h3>
<p>— (Liu Xinghuo)</p>
<p>The Purchasing Power Is Not What It Used to Be; Maintain the Indigenous Economy to Consolidate the Foundation for the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The common saying is: "The opportunity to make a foreign fortune has come!" Indeed, during the First World War, the deformed development of Shanghai's commerce did allow a few merchants to make huge profits, adding an astonishing amount to their fortunes. Regardless of whether the means of obtaining these fortunes were legitimate or despicable, the fact that their descendants used them to wield power and influence did make others envious. As a result, a gambling mentality was fostered. Many people believe that "hard work cannot make you rich" and fantasize about the arrival of a second opportunity to "make a foreign fortune."</p>
<p>The outbreak of this European war, in the eyes of merchants, is seen as a way to realize their fantasies. Therefore, they have been importing foreign goods in large quantities these past few days. This has caused the foreign exchange rate to be stretched as demand exceeds supply. The British pound is trading at four offices, and the US dollar has entered the seven-yuan range. Whether "foreign fortunes" can be made steadily in the future is still uncertain, but at least for now, their large-scale imports of foreign goods have temporarily plunged Shanghai's finances into chaos.</p>
<p>"Can foreign fortunes be made?" Of course, it depends on the skill, strength, and weakness of the merchants' methods. However, relying solely on the subjective power of merchants, it is actually impossible to be absolutely certain. The main determining force lies in the evolution of the objective situation.</p>
<p>In the current situation, this European war is similar to the last war in form but not in substance. The overall situation is vastly different from what it was. The participating countries in Europe are narrower than before, and the Far East is also experiencing the Sino-Japanese War. The former indicates that there is still some possibility for foreign goods to be transported to Shanghai, while the latter shows that the purchasing power of the Chinese people is weaker than it was during the previous European war. Looking ahead from these two points, there may be some profits, but making a "foreign fortune" is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Leaving aside international affairs, let's just talk about Shanghai. In recent years, the development of industry is not comparable to the immature situation in 1914. Many foreign goods have been replaced by domestic goods. Naturally, the appearance of domestic goods may not be as good as foreign goods, but their low price makes them suitable for the needs of most people below the capitalist class. Although the raw materials for Chinese industry still mostly rely on overseas sources, when there is no other choice, taking a step back to "indigenize" may still be able to sustain it.</p>
<p>Precisely to consolidate the economic foundation during the War of Resistance, it is not beneficial to the country to massively purchase foreign goods, causing capital outflow and disrupting the market by raising prices. On the contrary, if we can comprehensively plan a new domestic goods industry plan at this time and in this place, on the one hand, to meet the needs of Shanghai, and on the other hand, to maintain the export of indigenous goods as much as possible, we can make the wartime economic foundation stronger and unshakable. Merchants with long-term vision will certainly understand that "high-priced" "foreign goods" cannot be widely promoted in Shanghai. The longer the war lasts, the more financially strained people become, and the less sales "high-priced" "foreign goods" will have. And cheap, indigenous domestic goods will be more welcomed by people. Therefore, whether based on national interests or personal interests, establishing an indigenous industrial foundation during the war is the most legitimate and surest path for merchants at present. However, it must be remembered that even though it is said that "making a domestic (goods) fortune" is better than "making a foreign fortune," "business ethics" still need to be maintained. If one promotes "domestic goods" in name but actually "robs a burning house," then "making a domestic (goods) fortune" is no different in its depravity from "profiting from the national crisis."</p>
<h3>Mr. Wei Letang's Painted Fan</h3>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>Midnight</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Midnight" is a standard Hollywood comedy.</p>
<p>However, within this absurd story, it exposes the ugly side of so-called high society. Hollywood screenwriters often create various colorful stories to please gentlemen and ladies, but in an environment surrounded by pornography and money, the themes they can pick up are precisely the affairs of the gentlemen and ladies themselves. Therefore, when laughing at the characters on the silver screen, perhaps they are laughing at their own shadows! Just like this "Midnight," a singer who has nothing in her pockets after arriving in Paris suddenly wears a noble dress, goes in and out of high-rise buildings, and is chased by handsome young gentlemen. And an old rich man, unable to prevent his young wife from having affairs, uses this singer to cover up scandals that cannot be publicized... All of this, after the screenwriters' writing skills, is made into a comedy, but who can deny that this is not exposing the ugly side of capitalist society?</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert is indeed an excellent actor, a versatile actor. Here, she plays the singer Eve very appropriately. For example, when she impersonates an invitation ticket to sneak into the concert, when the waiter tells the host that there is a stranger, she reveals a slight embarrassment, but immediately looks left and right, pretending to also be paying attention to that guest; when she wakes up in a luxury hotel and recalls the wonderful encounter of last night, witnessing the miracle before her eyes, her joy and surprise are all acted out to the extreme.</p>
<p>The director's vivid and skillful handling makes this comedy full of humor and fun. Here are a few examples: In the concert, he outlined the postures of various characters, and the relationship between Claudette Colbert, John Barrymore, Mary Astor, and Francis Lederer was written with meticulous detail. In the villa, Mary Astor discovered Claudette Colbert's secret and intended to announce it to the public. Don Ameche arrives. In this complicated relationship, the director makes the audience smile knowingly at every relationship and every shot.</p>
<p>The last part where John Barrymore is on the phone and the courtroom scene are too nonsensical, but the examples cited above are still worth learning by young directors—to learn the skills, not the content.</p>
<p>Don Ameche has few scenes. Mary Astor is charming and lovely, resembling a virtuous wife rather than a promiscuous woman with affairs.</p>

<p>He Liyu said, "I was just about to tell you, we received a telegram from Father saying that a senior family friend will be coming to Shanghai on Monday and wants us to meet him. He is also one of the shareholders who initiated the silk weaving factory and has run silk weaving factories before, so there are many things to discuss with him. Therefore, we won't be able to go to Freedom Village next Sunday either. Now that you say next Sunday is Jin Danyun's wedding day, then we have already decided to go to her wedding banquet that day, and my beloved sister will naturally want to go as well. We can go together." Zhu Airen said, "Yes, although I can't easily leave the hospital, since I promised her, I will definitely go. Fortunately, it's a Sunday, so it won't interfere with my work. There will be many old friends and classmates there that day, so I can meet them. Because Danyun is very sociable and amiable, there will definitely be many people attending the wedding banquet that day. We are discussing whether to go early Sunday morning or Saturday evening. Danyun wants us to go Saturday evening. What do you two think?" He Shuangyu said, "We don't mind. Aren't we always free? If you say go Saturday evening, then we'll go Saturday evening. However, since we're not going to Freedom Village on Sunday, we should call Father and let him know. Perhaps Mother thinks we're going, and she's busy preparing lunch for us. Also, we're concerned about whether our land lease for building the factory has been submitted to the village council and approved. That's something we're very concerned about." Zhu Airen laughed and said, "Don't worry! I'll call them and let them know we're not going. As for your land lease for building the factory, it will definitely be approved, so don't worry. In the future, I think Freedom Village will definitely prosper with factories, but it will probably be limited to light industry. They say: there's a limit of ten factories, but that's how it is calculated now, and the future is still a question. My principle is slightly different from our old Father. He believes that this is a rural village and will remain a rural village in the future, so we should strive to improve agriculture. Farmers should maintain their original identity and preserve the simple and frugal customs of the countryside. However, I believe that China is gradually progressing, and it will inevitably evolve from an agricultural society to an industrial society, at least in the coastal provinces. Agriculture will advance to the inland, and there are many places in our inland that are barren for miles. This is not because those places are all desolate and infertile, but simply because they have not been developed. The current trend is for everyone to go to the inland and border areas to cultivate, while in these areas with convenient transportation, we will revitalize our industry." (179)</p>
<h3>YMCA Establishes Used Bookstore for Cheap Sales</h3>
<p>— Kongming</p>
<p>Maximize the Use of Waste to Make the Most of Resources, Cooperation from All Schools is Needed to Address Supply Difficulties</p>
<p>With the soaring prices of paper and printing, the cost of books used in schools has also increased significantly. To alleviate the burden on students, the YMCA students have launched a "Used Bookstore for Cheap Sales," selling used books from senior students to junior students for their use, maximizing the use of waste to make the most of resources. (All books are sold at 60% of the original price.) This has been quite popular.</p>
<p>However, recently there have been issues of insufficient supply to meet demand (very few are willing to sell drawing books such as complete English dictionaries and other high school science books, but there is a great demand for them), and insufficient demand to meet supply (many books, such as geography and history books, are being sold, but there are not many buyers, resulting in a large stock of books). To resolve this difficulty, it is not only necessary to rely on the enthusiastic assistance of the high school students in the association, but also to hope that other students (regardless of school) will provide more help and guidance. If any student feels like they have searched high and low without finding a used book, or if they have a used book and are willing to sell it at a low price (60%), please contact the YMCA. To facilitate students and serve the community, no commission is charged, unlike other stores that are profit-oriented. (Thank you)</p>
<h3>New Cookbook</h3>
<p>— Respectfully Submitted by Your Servant Gu Zhongjing</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices have soared, and middle and lower-class families are mostly using wheat flour to fill their stomachs. However, the price of flour has also recently risen to six or seven yuan, and the general working masses are running around all day, still unable to get a full meal, which is truly the most serious problem in society. Now, I have a method that can temporarily alleviate the urgent situation. The method is to mix ten ounces of flour with six or eight ounces of bean dregs (commonly known as tofu dregs, sold by tofu shops). It is sweet and delicious, and bean dregs contain a large amount of vitamins. A large bowl can be bought for forty or fifty cents. Add a little salt and it can be eaten. I have tried it many times. Therefore, I ask that it be published in the newspaper to spread the word. I respectfully wish you good health in your writing.</p>

<h3>The Ideological Problem of Actors</h3>
<p>— Outsider</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, it seems that no one has ever discussed it, nor has anyone paid attention to it. However, I believe this issue is more important than "theatrical ethics" and the cultivation of actors' skills. The status of actors was previously despised by society, as they were considered to be worthless. Later, times and society changed, and after several ambitious actors awakened and made efforts, they gradually gained their current status.</p>
<p>When people praise actors, apart from their artistry, they always talk about how good their theatrical ethics are and how they have a spirit of courageous action, but rarely say that this actor is rich in national thought and national consciousness. This has fostered a kind of individual heroism, where they only know how to keep themselves clean and good, while neglecting the destruction and harm they cause to the entire nation and country. Therefore, I can say that actors in general lack a great deal of national thought. After being induced by fame and fortune, they are willing to do any kind of work, regardless of its nature. Of course, there are exceptions, but they are still in the absolute minority.</p>
<p>Last time, Kunqu actress Zhao Xiaolan flattered in Nanjing and secretly broadcasted in Shanghai, and this newspaper criticized and attacked her. However, when "Manchukuo" was established in the three northeastern provinces, many famous actors also went to participate in the "celebration," and many actors who were more knowledgeable and popular than Zhao Xiaolan went to the grand performances in "Eastern Hebei." That phenomenon shows that actors with a sense of fame and fortune have no nation or country in their minds, only personal happiness.</p>
<p>Of course, patriotic enthusiasm like that of Pan Yueqiao and others can still be seen in Shanghai. The previous drama troupe and stage colleagues who went to comfort the isolated army are good examples. Recalling the enthusiastic situation when Shanghai had not yet fallen, when broadcasting on the radio to encourage the purchase of national salvation bonds, it was indeed worthy of praise, but I believe that this is a very small expression and also an obligation that every citizen should have.</p>
<p>The lack of thought among actors is partly due to environmental factors. The coercion and temptation of the environment can also lead you down the path of selling your conscience. Improving the environment cannot be achieved by empty talk, so in the current environment, the most important thing is self-examination, striving to avoid bad temptations, and not selling your personality for the sake of life. Do as much as you can, and if the environment forces you down a dead end, then the only way is to break away from this dark environment.</p>
<p>Another point is that no one corrects them. Those who praise them only focus on the artistic aspect, and those who are knowledgeable only point out your artistic mistakes, absolutely not interfering in your private life and thoughts. In addition, actors rarely receive higher education, which fosters their selfish and profit-oriented hearts. Therefore, I hope that actors, in their spare time, in addition to artistic cultivation, also think about enriching their knowledge. This work requires the assistance and guidance of others.</p>
<p>In addition to actors having thoughts, an additional task to be done is to perform more meaningful plays (naturally, there is a causal relationship between thought and action here). "Eternal Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," "Liang Hongyu," and "Nanjie Pass," etc., all involve loyal service to the country. Other old plays can also perform "Battle of Pu Pass" and "Ningwu Pass" kinds of plays.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Ouyang Yuqian created improved Pingju for the China Drama Troupe in Shanghai, and most of it was about patriotism. We will not talk about the success of the improved Pingju, but we always believe that it is commendable to adopt plays with meaningful themes. Undoubtedly, in addition to actors themselves having national thoughts, they must also think about influencing the audience so that they can gain something besides watching the play, and remind the audience not to be intoxicated in the environment of singing and dancing for peace.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters of the acting world, please examine yourselves!</p>

<p>A Teacher's Son Becomes Mayor</p>
<p>There are many strange things in the officialdom, especially in these years, where true talent and learning are not valued. As long as there are various relationships such as relatives and acquaintances on the family tree, it is much easier to find a job. If you can also flatter and cater to the superiors, buying everything they like, slowly mixing with friends who are "dog skin plasters," then you don't have to worry about your behavior. No matter how bad your qualifications are, you are guaranteed to be an official. During the Zhili-Lu Army era, there was a man named Zhao Yaoyun, who was originally a country bumpkin who couldn't recognize a few characters. Later, he became the chief advisor to the Zhili Governor's Office. A paint shop owner named Wang actually became the chief of the military law office and the magistrate of Tianjin County. The most ridiculous thing was that Yuan Zhenqing, who once served as the garrison commander of Tianjin, was also illiterate. He and Zhang Zongchang were friends who were "dog skin plasters." When the Zhili-Lu Army failed, he immediately ran to the famous opium den "Deyi Lou" in Tianjin to become a "smoke lighter," sitting on a small stool in front of the opium bed to light pipes for people. He was not ashamed of himself, and the saying "a great man can bend and stretch" can be used to describe this gentleman. It is said that the reason he became poor was due to the influence of his concubine eloping. In the end, he had a bank account with 100,000 yuan. When he was taking a car to the bank to withdraw money, he stopped by a friend's house for a short visit. When he said goodbye and came out, the car was already gone, and the 100,000 yuan in the leather bag in the car was considered a white gift to the driver. His opium expenses were very high, costing several thousand yuan a day. At first, he could sell some clothes and furniture, but later, when these things were sold out, he had to sit on a low stool and light pipes for people. (95)</p>
<h3>The Earliest Tanhuang</h3>
<p>— Xitong</p>
<p>I was quite interested in reading Tianxu Wusheng's preface to the Ankang Gathering and Danran's Another Interpretation of Ankang in this publication. I don't have much research on this, but I only know that there is an article by Xu Chuanlin (i.e., Li Amao, who runs a tofu shop) in the special issue of Xiaoshuo Yuebao on Chinese Literature Research, "A Glimpse of Chinese Popular Literature - Tanhuang," and another article by Li Jiarui of the Academia Sinica in Renjianshi, "Tanhuang." They have described the origin, classification, evolution, etc. of Tanhuang in great detail, so there is no need for me to elaborate.</p>
<p>The value of Tianxu Wusheng's article lies in explaining that the main tones of Ankang in Hangzhou and Sutan's string music differ by one character because he is proficient in music theory. As for the origin of Tanhuang, tracing it back to Wen Tianxiang at the end of the Song Dynasty, or even to the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove in the Jin Dynasty, I think that is going too far. As Yun said in Volume 3 of Wen Wenshan's Complete Works, the Guide Record, each saying is a seven-character quatrain, with a description of the event in front, but not all of them are like this. Among them, there is a very long five-character ancient poem "On the Road to Gaosha," and after the poem "Guixiang," they are all five-character poems, and even most of them have no description of the event. Regarding Tanhuang as Taihuang is only because of Wen Tianxiang's preface to Passing Huangyan, which says: "I changed my name when I arrived at Huai. When I reached the territory of Tiantai, Zhang Zhezai found the Green Ripple Poem for me. After I wrote it, I titled it Written by Liu Zhu of Qingjiang. This is Passing Huangyan, sending twenty characters." I also think this is just speculation.</p>
<p>Approximately, Tanhuang was created because Kunqu was difficult to understand, so they changed the singing but not the dialogue. Kunqu also sings works from the Qing Dynasty. For example, the plays "Broken Bridge Meeting" and "Hebo" sung in Tanhuang mentioned by Xu Chuanlin were all changed from the Legend of Leifeng Pagoda. The earliest author of the Legend was Huang Tumi in the Yongzheng period. From this, it can be known that Tanhuang occurred after the Yongzheng period, even in the Qianlong era.</p>
<p>I have recently seen two earlier records of Tanhuang:</p>
<p>(1) In the fourth act of Shen Qi's Legend of the Wenxing Bang during the Qianlong period, the clownish Taoist says: "Singing Tanwang is my invention." He also says, "Selling olives, rude words are directly sprayed, eating vegetarian meals, chewing maggots in a mess." Selling olives and eating vegetarian meals are famous plays of "Houtan." It is unexpected that these plays already existed during the Qianlong period.</p>
<p>(2) In the episode "Fortune Telling" in the Zhui Bai Qiu Tong Ji (i.e., the current Zhui Bai Qiu Collection, Volume 3, Volume 11) in the 39th year of Qianlong, it is said: "Wait a moment, I also want to add a Tan Tou."</p>
<p>Even Taoists and fortune tellers also sing Tanhuang, which shows the popularity of Tanhuang at that time.</p>
<p>Before finding records about Tanhuang that are earlier than the Qianlong era, I will reserve my statement that Tanhuang originated in the Qianlong era.</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple Smokes Opium</h3>
<p>— Huazhi</p>
<p>Shirley Temple recently has two new films, both centered on romance, and it is said that they have been performed with great success. One film is called "Miss Jane," which seems to be a true portrayal of Shirley's life. This is her sixth anniversary work dedicated to the screen; the other film is called "Susannah of the Mounties." This is Shirley's twentieth blockbuster. In this film, Shirley lives with the mountain people and learns many strange customs. There is a shot specifically filming her smoking opium. The Fox Company was afraid of burning her tongue, so they specially invited the fire scene arrangement expert from the film "Chicago Fire" to make a pipe for Shirley, with a mechanism inside. When Shirley is smiling and spewing clouds and fog on the screen, there is actually no smoke leaking into her mouth, otherwise she might have been sobbing long ago. According to Shirley's mother, romance films should not be performed too much. Shirley's ambition is to become a female detective. Letting her play in horror adventure films later will definitely be even more outstanding.</p>
