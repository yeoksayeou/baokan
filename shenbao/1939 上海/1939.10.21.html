<h3>格魯大使警告日本　美國決心維護在華權益　嚴詞排斥日本所謂『東亞新秩序』　日軍殘暴行為美朝野所深惡痛絕</h3>
<p>東京　美國駐日大使格魯、今午在美日協會宴會時、對於美日關係作極坦直之說明、其扼要語爲「美國人民決訐維護其在華久已成立之權利」一句、格魯近甫從美返此、要人之與宴以聆其言論者不下七百人、美大使於聲稱渠不欲談及瑣碎事件以凟在座者淸聽後、謂「余以爲此間未有一人不知美國輿情大不滿於今日在華日軍所爲之若干事件、如侵犯美人在華權益與合法利益等是、」繼謂凡此事實、爲美國朝野所確知、爲日美間將來利益計、此種事伴必須有以應付之、非因有建設性質之步驟、以改變此種事伴、則兩國關係焉能改善云、格魯又謂美人信任世界各處商業機會之平等、日本雖在中國以外之區域要求門戶開放而獲門戶開放之惠、然在中國則以此種原則不能適用爲言、卽有除外者、亦僅爲肢體不全生意索然之形式云、格魯又謂、日方常作美國朝野不了解「東亞新秩序」之責言、共實美國朝野了解此新秩序之意義、明白確切與日本相同、日本官塲解釋此「新秩序」爲安全穩定與進步之秩序、此固美國朝野不獨爲自己且爲全世界各國所願有者、然而此「東亞新秩序」者、顯然欲排斥美人在華成立已久之權益、此乃美國人民所反對者也云、美大使末稱渠之見解、確實代表並傳達美國朝野之一般戚想、美國對於遠東近來發展之輿情幾成一致、其所根據者爲事實而非宣傳、此種全國一致之輿情、乃美政府不能稍加忽視之力量、終必在其政策上與行動上見之云</p>
<p>美大使於力言美國人民、對於日軍在中國所施甩之手段日益憎惡後、續謂、美人對於日本之濫施轟炸、極爲震驚、美國輿情之所以爲之震動者、不僅爲人道主之故、且因其直接危害美人之生命財產、並使美人喪失生命、及成爲殘廢也、美人對放在華日軍之不顧若干國家連同日本在內所簽定之條的協定、而侵犯及干涉美國之權利已日加重視、美人不僅因彼等根深蒂固之權利、如均等機會及公平待遇等、遭受剝奪而感覺煩惱、更覺目前遠東之趨勢、若長此不已、將使彼等誠墊抱有秩序的世界之發展希望、成爲泡影、美大使續稱、美國在華之權益、刻正受日本在華當局之政策與行動所損害與摧殘、美人財產、日受損毀、美國僑民陷於危險而遭侮辱、余對於上述各事、如作詳細之陳述、則君等必感覺美人所持之態度爲穩健而充分正當無疑也、總之、美國人民、就所得其可靠之證據中、已有充分理由、相信日本爲其本身之利益計、現正努力在亞洲大陸之廣大區域中、設立統制、並在該區、實施一種封鎖的經濟制度、上述情形、加以轟炸侮辱、及美國權利所受之種種干預、皆爲造成美國人民今日對日本態度之原因、余之信念、及美國政府與人民之信念、皆以爲日方人員所施有害美國許多事件、實完全不必行之、吾人深信遠東之眞正安全與穩定、須不違反任何美國之權利、始能達到云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>渝人士表示歡迎</h3>
<p>重慶　此間華方各界人士對於美國駐日大使格魯在東京所發之演說，皆矛歡迎、謂其內容已坦白闡明美國在連東之政策與其態度、且可使日本人士獲有機會、一聆外人對於日軍在華行動之質直言論、及世界對於日本在華各種活動之輿論、格魯大使之演詞已引起極普遍之評論、並在華人中留一極好印象、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本各報之反感</h3>
<p>東京　今日此間各報批評美國駐日大使格魯述及美國對日本在華政策的態度之演說、一中外商業新聞」批評美大使演說稱、此種正式表示美國之　點、足證美國對於日本以國運作孤注一擲、而致力建設東亞新秩序之立場與決心、無論在形式上或實質上均加決絕云、「朝日新聞」載稱、美大在使演詞之「坦白」固堪贊許、惟美國輿情之偏見與誤解、亟應加以坦白之矯正云、「都新聞」稱、日本堅抱決心邁進、履行其建設東亞新秩序之殺高使命而不顧美國之輿情云、「國民新聞」力稱、若被美國輿情所　嚇、則愚不可及矣、日政府應就其眞實情况、估量美日局勢而推進東亞新秩序之建設云、（廿日路透電）</p>
<h3>中蘇締盟傳說　純係日方造謠</h3>
<p>重慶　消息靈通之華人各界皆稱、外間所傳中蘇即將締結軍事協定、及蘇聯屯兵於新疆之謠言、乃日方之宣傳、此項謠言由日人審愼造作、以圖搖撼英國在遠東之政策、且不先不後、適在英大使寇爾爵士行抵重慶之前後傳出、其計殊巧、日方並散播謠言、謂英大使刻正促請國民政府和平解決中是爭端、此則為日方此種宣傳之最後目的、日政府見其計未售、英國不原油出為調人、且不能壓迫中國與日本　種、今仍圖以蘇聯即將控制中國之謠言恫嚇英國、故日方刻正廣播中蘇即將締結軍事協定之謠言、且蘇聯軍隊刻集中新疆、圖迫中國接受其要求云云、日人希望藉此引起列强對蘇聯勢力在華膨壓迫國民政府與日本媾和、以銷除蘇聯在華握控制權之可能　危險、據消息靈通觀察家言、日本在華所經營之一切、已完全失敗、故乃琿精竭慮、造爲謠　、俾中日戰事得早結束云、（　日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　華盛頓官員昨日拒不批評中國方面傳來消息、謂　蘇有簽訂軍事同盟之可能、據該項消息聲稱、蘇聯軍事考　　已於本星期抵達重慶、其目的爲與中國談判兩國締結軍墨同盟、但此間消息靈通人十相信、蘇聯赴華之軍事考察　任務、大的將限於軍事顧問職　、一部份人士相信、中蘇或磋產一種協定、規定蘇聯接濟運入中國、但懷疑兩國問即將締結完全軍事同盟、此間觀察家相信、中蘇締結軍事協定、將爲未來英日間關係之主要因素、據云英日已考慮蘇德間之新關　一般相信、倘蘇聯經濟援德、妨碍英國對德封鎖之效力、則英國目將設法與日本接近、但多數觀察家懷疑任何新發展、能便美國或英國减少對華同惰性、美國對蘇聯奧論、因遭遇兩種不同問題、以致舉棋不定、東部各州對波羅的海及北海各國、表示熱烈同情、故欲抵抗蘇聯侵略、但西部各州則受蘇聯態度之影響、以爲蘇聯能抵抗日本之擴展、（二十日美聯電）</p>
<h3>日蘇關係　勢難改善　傳蒙邊有新衝突</h3>
<p>荷京　據聞蘇聯與日本兩國軍隊、又在滿蒙邊境發生敵對行動、此間各觀察家咸引以爲異、「商務總滙報」並發表社論云、「日蘇兩國前於本月八日所簽訂之滿蒙邊境停戰協定、茲已歸於無效，此非一般人始料所及、各該國所有爭議、未能予以解決、可於此見之、吾人於此、不禁發問曰、蘇聯所由簽訂停戰協定、殆欲延宕時日、俾克鞏固其在歐洲方面所佔有之地位歟、今後該國其將向遠東積極發展、驅逐日本勢力向東退却、一如在歐洲驅遂德國勢力向西退却歟、換言之、蘇聯其將積極援助中國、强使日本屆服、從而在亞洲政治上希圖取獲領導權歟、要之、蘇聯目下行動、業已側重遠東、則有可斷言」云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國在遠東的軍事準備</h3>
<p>今日英國的遭遇，與上决大戰中頗有不同之處；即遠東烽火，早在兩年前爆發，以前代她作遠東「看門狗」的友人，現在雖傾其全力，在亞洲大陸，作孤注一擲的軍事行動，而其心目中，固念念不忘如何打擊英國的勢力，俾圓其獨覇亞洲的好夢；如何實現其南進的企圖，俾其在物產豐富的南洋，得佔一席，以補償先天經濟的不足。故英國在歐洲有其正面的敵人德國，而在亞洲，也有其另一敵對的勢力存在。這一勢力，目前因其泥足的膠着於中國，雖有雞零狗碎的掠奪與壓迫，使英國不免於若干損失，然不能爲英國大患，惟其一貫的侵略政策，及其所包藏的野心，終不能不說是英國未來的殷憂。因爲英國遠東的許多殖民地如香港新加坡，及自治領如新西蘭澳洲等，都與日本的海軍根據地僅一水之隔，日本的艦隊，朝發夕至，即可攻擊此等地方。正如新西蘭一個政論家所說：「我們目前已深知所謂遠東，對於我們，僅爲近北。科學日漸消除空間的制限，我們的安全，將因日本海軍擴張派的政策與行動而不可靠。我們所應估計海軍來攻的里程，不是橫濱與雪尼的里程，而是柏勞島與新幾尼的里程。」</p>
<p>因此英國在此歐洲烽火瀰天的時候，如何保護其東方的領土，自爲英政府中人所極爲關心的問題。在歐戰未發生前，由印度調往新加坡的軍隊，達八千人之多。最近據新加坡總督湯瑪斯報告，英防軍續有自印度開到。這種軍隊調遣的目的，據英帝國印度事務大臣塞特倫在上院的說明，謂「此項辦法，係經海陸軍當局的迫切勸告而後採行者，彼時局勢，印度安全，似有自東面遭受威脅的可能。自軍事觀點言之，自東西兩面通達印度之地點，實有予以充實防衛的必要。一所謂西方的威脅，自指德蘇南下而言，而所謂柬方的威脅，其心目中當然不是中國。</p>
<p>英國在遠東的軍事準備，早在今年六月間在新加坡所開的防衛會議中決定。這决會議的目的，在乎組成太平洋防律委員會，以調整新西蘭，澳洲及南太平洋港英國軍隊間的合作爲目的。此會由新西蘭澳洲及英帝國各派三人組成，並指定軍事代表。爾後受此機關指揮的兵力，有英國駐華艦隊，有澳洲皇家海軍及新西蘭海軍，有遠東皇家空軍，澳洲皇家空軍，新西蘭皇家空軍，及駐防於遠東及太平洋上各殖民地的軍像等。又此次會議的主要目的，是在產生一東方獨立軍備；一旦有事，可獨自爲戰而不須依賴英帝國本國人力補充，物資供給。爲此，新西蘭及澳洲等自治領，近幾年來，也與其母國取一致步諷，加速進行海空的軍備擴張。澳洲政府，在海軍方面，現有新式巡洋艦五艘，驅逐艦五艘。還有驅逐艦兩艘在建造中，並有沿海防禦艦隊，艦上之水兵約有六千人。至於空軍，則有飛機二百十二架，駕駛員三千人；並另設有飛機廠，平時每年可造作戰飛機四百架，戰時可達一千架，新西蘭對於空軍的發展亦極迅速，也有飛機工廠的設立。</p>
<p>更有一點値得我們注意的，是法國預聞這次會議，並雙方同意於兩國海陸空在遠東密切合作。法國與澳洲同時復有默契，即法國太平洋沿岸的領土，爲軍事上的理由，可爲澳洲作防衛之用。至於在遠東與英屬殖民地有密切關係的荷屬東印度，雖荷蘭對歐洲事件，取中立態度，然她對於其東印度的殖民地，却不能超然，而必須加入這一集團，以共同應付外來的侵略。</p>
<p>有關軍事的，每每含些秘密性，而爲局外人所不能深知底細；但我們鑒於英國國民性的實事求是，故於上述英國在東方的軍事佈置，亦可深信其非虛張聲勢。換言之，英法荷三國各自治領與殖民地密切合作之結果，至少無虞於外力的侵略。由此推論，外傳英日聯合宣言與英日恢復同盟云云，雖未經英國的關係方面加以吾認，或因其爲無價値的傳說而視爲不値得吾認，然以軍事爲外交後盾，軍事上既能有恃無恐，外交便不必屈膝求全；而種種傳說亦自不必輕信。何况曠觀大局，第一，英國對日妥協與英國對美期待，根本非能並行不悖，英國豈可得兼？謂英甯疎美國而親日本，這是不可思議的境界。第二，友不厭多，任何國家在戰時，敵務求少，雖是鐵則；但遠東已戰兩年有餘，歐戰不過五旬，日本在對華戰事欲罷不能之時，不敢再與英國或任何他國作戰，實遠過於歐戰中的英國，不敢與日本作戰；二者比較，英國允不致屈膝。這是考察英國與法荷合作，在東方軍事佈置完竣後，當然的結論！</p>

<p>倫敦　英相張伯倫昨晚在下院歡呼聲中宜布英法土互助條的成立、反對派工黨領袖阿特里與自由黨海立斯後皆起立致詞爲政府賀、張伯倫之言曰、下院諸君、當記得余曾於木年五月十二日聲稱、英政府與土政府已允為國家安全起見、締結相互性質之長期協定、兩國政府在此協定尙待成立時、曾宣布兩國已準備在某種環境中切實合作、此後雙方決定長期協定、宜採英法土三角條的之形式、雖五月十二日以還繼續進行之談判、延長頗久、然從未有意見上重要岐異之表示、始終在相互信任之氣氛中進行、英法土互助條的各條文、在三星期前卽已磋商就緒、土耳其政府希望其外長之往游莫斯科、或可獲有土蘇締結同樣條的之結果、乃得英法兩國政府之同意、展綏簽字、土外長薩拉柯格魯在莫斯科辦理之談判、現已暫時停頓、其故以土　　　蘇聯所提出之某種建議、不能與英法土業已譏定之點相融洽、惟蘇土雙方皆宣布、土國對蘇關係、依然友好、同時土政府決定不再延緩英法土互助條約之簽字、余願喚起注意者、此的有效時期至少爲十五年、是以此非應付一種緊急事變之暫時辦法、但爲三國政府推行一種長期合作政策之確證、進行已久之談判、今已圓滿成功、其人民爲吾人極所欽佩之一國、今已與吾人切實成立密切親善關係、余信下院諸君聞之、定爲欣幸云、工黨領袖阿特里繼起發言、表示歡迎、並希望此項協定可持久、英土友誼愈臻堅固、自由黨海立斯亦起立致詞、謂困難談判、卒賴外相哈立法克斯與政府諸人之指導得宜、克底於成、此誠爲大勝利、上决歐戰以還、土耳其在藝術文化與經濟發展上、進步極大、使人欽佩、今與英國爲法律秩序與國際事件之談嚴、共同奮鬥、此乃允可滿意者也云、各議員聞言皆歡呼若在、（二十日路透電）</p>

<h3>義大利　亦所歡迎</h3>
<p>羅馬　英法土訂的所引起之新局勢中、有兩種因素爲此間所歡迎、一爲土耳其之拒絕變更韃靼海峽現狀、以利蘇聯、義國殊不願見蘇聯海軍成爲地中海內之一因素、一爲土耳其保持對羅馬尼亞之保證、義國認此乃土耳其對於解決巴爾幹懸案與組織巴爾幹和平集團兩事予以注意之徵象、法西斯人士認此的之締結、乃蘇土談判停頓之自然結果、蓋土外長在莫斯科談判時、已表示其在對蘇關係中之獨立矣、據此間人士意見、蘇德協定成立以前所有之局勢、今亦恢復、此雖對於戰事未必有直接影響、但對於未可逆料之將來發展、則似有重大關係云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>德國官方　憤懣失望</h3>
<p>柏林　英法土耳其三國互助條的簽字之後、德國官方人士旣憤懣而又失望此可於各晨報評論中見之、愛森國民日報（航空部長戈林上將機關報）嘗在數日之前登載一文、力言「土國決定態度、此其時矣、一茲乃不得不以悲觀口吻、承認土國業已決定去取、但其所採方向、并非德國始料所及、甚至謂土國已成爲英國之僱傭兵、另一方面、此間一般人對於蘇土兩國談判歸於失敗一層、極其關切、幷以蘇聯曾吾堅持德國觀點、幷顧及其利益爲問又謂英法土三國互助條的、目標所在、顯欲抵抗德國在東南歐擴展勢力、不意此的公佈之後、蘇聯並不爲之震驚、殊堪注意、至蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基日來迭决與英國外相哈里法克斯勛爵進行談話、亦極為此間一般人所疑慮、總之、一般輿論認爲德國又巴受蘇聯之紿、但德國官方人士則謂、「土國業已犯有波蘭國相同之錯誤、」藉以威脅土國、（二十日合瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　關於英法土簽訂互助條的一事、此間官方尚無評論發表、政界人士謂此係針對蘇聯與義大利而發、德國當俟蘇義兩國表示反應之後、始發表評論云、（二十日海通電）</p>

<h3>英國準備情形　遠勝於昔　海軍力能控制北海　自信可操勝利左券</h3>
<p>倫敦　據此問有經騐之觀察家言、英國今日之準備、遠勝於一九一四年、英國儲積軍需整頓軍隊、實施强迫軍役已及一年、且不似上决大戰須分兵前往美索波太米亞·埃及·與韃靼海峽、今能傾其海軍全力、以阻止對德之接濟、並能在西綫出兵百萬、而自始即置於號令統一之下、德國則在開戰之初、民食不給、人心不振、其所有供給僅敷短時之需、而其仰賴蘇聯接濟原斜之希望亦復黯淡、雖有數國現仍與德國繼續交通、惟德國存金有限、不足以償付從此數國購得之物價、各中立國鑒於英國之堅決、現皆承認英國取締德國接濟之權、德國唯一希望、厥爲速戰速了、然爲布置堅之馬奇諾陣綫所阻、殊無成功機會、英國雖稍受損失、現仍控制北海、因英國船隻極多易於彌補也、德國自稱控制北海、並稱北海爲日耳曼海岸、惟北海中今日並無德國商輪一艘之踪跡、德輪旣不能駛入北海、亦不能穿越英國軍艦與飛機所布成之網、而英國海船則往來北海中絡繹不斷、德國艦隊迄未作衝破此鋼網之希圖、而德國空軍加諸英艦之攻擊、亦徒成代價甚大之失敗云、（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>金融　港帮全日賣出外匯　香島商業不易活動　資金仍向上海移轉</h3>
<p>外匯匯豐掛牌、仍無上落、英美滙暗市、趨勢穩中仍見微硬、情況則仍呆定、價格已無投機性、至昨日過程初因海外美英匯兌又長一分、致晨開即呈英緊美平之象、繼以港帮多頭猛塞、及出口商亦接踵吐售、而匯豐則照數力吸、惟美匯已長至七元七五、但以有利亦來吃進、故鬆勢才得挽轉、然港帮全日斷續拋出、聞有二十餘萬鎊之巨、（的合國幣一千餘萬元、）致結果英平美微鬆、據聞華商港帮連日賣出大量籌碼、乃因法幣之極度機定、而歐局日緊，以及港島戰事商業上之種種桎梏、使資金不易活動、故資金有轉向上海之自然趨勢矣、至期貨潛勢、原與現貨一　、但鮮聞交易做開、全天交易除港帮外、餘則寥寥、</p>
<p>有利仍在吸收</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期縮一二五、遠期降三七五、紐約銀價跌二五、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬·法·等各匯俱平、美對英長一分、對滬未更、對法大一分一二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士九三七五、美匯七元六八七五、較之前收、英略緊〇一五六二五、美則無榮辱、乃匯兌上漲之故、開後香港來電拋塞、且出口商亦來吐售、是以趨勢略形鬆硬、計港電與出口商吐予匯豐現貨奐金六二五、同時現貨美匯亦硬至七元七五、但鮮聞成交、匯豐掛牌揭唬勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭小一分、此後買賣雙方談論交易者轉少、故市面一度頗形沉靜、迨至十時半後、有利突來吸收、同行現貨英金四便士六二五、並現貨美匯七元七一八七五、情况似稍轉平、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四便士六〇九三七五、美滙七元七一八七五、比晨開英回鬆〇一五六二五、美微便〇三一二五、</p>
<p>後市狀態愈靜、價亦鮮榮辱可言、但港電則續來塞予匯豐現貨英金四使士六二五、美匯則未聞做開、迨至晚收、銀行現貨賣價英金四便士六〇九三七五、美匯七元七一八七五、（照上價多數恐難購得）、本月份與上價相同、十一月份英金四便士五四六八七五、美匯七元五九三七五、結果比上日現期英均平，美則俱鬆〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港英滙不動</p>
<p>香港二十日電、今晨匯市開盤平平、英匯現期均不動、美匯現貨鬆〇六二五、為二十五元〇六二五、遠期未開出、申匯降一元、為三百二十二元、日匯現貨微鬆二五、為一百〇六元七五、全日市面平穩、行情亦無榮學、</p>
<p>天津滙價續鬆</p>
<p>天津二十日電、今晨匯市開盤、續見放長、英麗現貨鬆〇六二五、為四便士一二五、美匯現貨鬆一二五、為六元九三七五、申匯續降二元七角半、為一百十元零五角、「聯鈔」暗盤不動、仍為八十六元、</p>
<h3>現金風平浪靜</h3>
<p>昨日現金拾赤暗盤市况平疲之勢未稍蜆化、上落範圍之小及經營者之乏味、木報前昨屢陳於先、恕不再述論、全日經過則疲莫能興、初時即遭金號猛撳、聞盤途為叫千元、較上臼已跌九元、惟限價買戶棄集、港帮之反拉會抬高八元、嗣以外匯帶硬、金號再吐、卒賴錢兌業代客乘機扒進、使怠勢不致擴大、第以一度盤旋、終以叫千〇〇五元收盤、比隔昨疲落叫元、交易平淡、共的六百餘兩、銀樓飾金呆定、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤僅挫四元</p>
<p>自農每條（十兩）初開因外隴仍稍帶硬、形勢虛疲、某金號首來基予證券帮、一十兩、為四千元、較之前收竟撳小九元、少頃港帮發動採辦、買氣忽濃、故為狀轉穩、某銀樓代香港帮力吸二百兩光景、回高八元、均由錢兌業金號及同業等供基、嗣以港帮止淮旁觀、市勢又告不支、立再下降六元、錢兌業吐予證券帮三十兩、為四千〇〇二元、後某錢兌業突來拉提後、回起五元、錢兌業進某銀號土兩、為四千〇〇七元、午刻形勢重稍帶疲、錢兌業五做二十兩、為叫千〇〇五元、作午收價、午後成交愈稀、趨勢亦極平靜、首由金號進錢兌業十兩、價仍為四千○〇五元、繼之證券帮收濰錢兌業數十兩、為四千〇〇六元及〇〇七元、入後另一證券帮與金號相繼吐予錢兌業二十兩、為四千〇〇五元作晚　價結果比隔昨亂跌四元、全天祇八元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照炩赤較高十元、收進須减低三十元之譜、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、因炩赤趨勢愈呆、故未見更動、大同行仍懸四百〇五元原價、新同行與上價相同、收進須减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>證劵　行市堅穩</h3>
<p>統一公債昨暗盤市况、因各方觀望、市氣殊為閒散、價格上落依然徘徊、加以消息沉寂、大戶裏足不前、浮空更少進取、以致市態淸淡、咋市過程、當晨間做開、首由聯益及散戶紛湧納淮要頗堅俏、即續升二三角、入後恒孚大通通記永大等號、忽起拋塞、買戶進力轉弱、又復回降、下午起伏益狹、交易奇少、買方僅四十九號及散戶較有進意、而拋者祗以四十二號及興元稍多、市價結果、一致繼續微升五分至二角、九六獨小五分、成交四四餘萬元、</p>
<p>股票、五洲藥房股成交六十股、價四十九元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市、潛勢難仍堅挺、但乏衝破隔晚高價之力、多種股票、　格在稍回時會被強力支撐、結果成交方面、略形减少、情和紗廠、國際信託公司揚子銀公司朁電話公司等股、為昨日市塲交易中之崢嶸頭角者、橡皮股需要亦告良好、</p>
<p>倫一敦十九日電、今日英商遠東各公司掛牌行市、大體均告平靜、惟古拉客林傍橡皮股回降八便士、仍為十五先令七便士、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦十九臼電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍告平穩、上下各種債券均告不動、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖進銳退速</h3>
<p>昨糖市因外電回跌、據荷蘭電訊、組白已降至荷盾一一·三三、而太古B嘜前日廠盤十四元之價、本係喊盤、昨已有實價、以港幣十六元二角開出二千包、故公會劃盤、以連日上漲過高、回跌亦　、現貨二四　本棧初為五十八元、至八元半、及九三元八角、　口貨四十六元、降四元半、太古車白B　降二元半至三元半、為六十二元半至六十一元半、CW嘜六十一元、XC嘜六十元半、DY嘜五十九元、HX嘜五十八元半、H嘜車赤四十三元半、小一元半荷赤四十四兀半、小一元、本綿白振記一號五十八元半、一號冰七十元、　明冰七十一元半、均降四元、　繼因亦回疲、高黃崗靑開出三百四十五包、碼頭交貨價為三十六元、比前反見遜色、查糖昨由香港來五百包、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗多頭　陣容瓦解</h3>
<p>紗市直　下降、且跌風未　、局勢依然衰弱、其原因為客銷仍乏特色、市塲現貨籌碼殊感增加、紗市基礎愈形不固、至於一般團戶、鑒於實際消化不良、而環境不利、多方吸收加碼之念絕少、因之　馬一牌、大家將其作標準看待、昔日多方抬力特強、故漲豐奇　、近來一變、跌勢獨盛、　昔與其同廠出品之二十支天女紗、要漲逾百元、目下日見軋　、可見多方陣容瓦解、不過原棉尙　定、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人頭渙散　集會者稀少、延至十點鐘才開槃、一跌十元、雙馬價為六百八十元、少頃賣聲大振、客銷勿動、再降至六百六十五元、旋以搶帽之流又見死灰復燃回升一步、迨至收盤仍平庸、半日成交一千二百九十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌十七元。天女跌十五元、雙地球跌十二元、茲將現紗各客帮買去之額量列左、同行　九七〇　香港　三五內地　一〇〇　統計　一·二九五</p>
<h3>棉市冷寂</h3>
<p>本棉交易仍無新發展、且市象　案異常、良以紗市一瀉千里、步步發現新低價、廠方儘將存棉需用、暫時無意補充原料、所以生意大為冷淡、惟靑島方面、對於卅二支原料續有採辦、然額量甚微、蘇北來源尙堪維持、通花到一千五百餘包、又北沙來六百八十包、今日出口棉有五百四十件運香港、價開短二元茲將現棉售盤情形列左、</p>
<p>巴西特　一八六·〇〇　一九〇·五〇　同業五百件</p>
<p>通州花　一三四·〇〇　一三四·五〇　又　四〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來因紗價之疲軟不振、廠方按照目前原棉之售價、計算成本、每包需虧四五十元不等、故對原棉之採購、均中止購辦、同業之手貨、前俱為高價貨、故暫時不願售出、故日來交易殊為靜寂、祇有靑島帮以高級巴西售價尙康、昨日辦進三百五十件、價為一百八十六元、殊為廉宜也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、開盤較為參差、並呈疲乏之狀、同業尙形活躍然受海外商跌落三四磅音、後又因歐洲局勢、有利於多方、及南方帮之在市購買、市價頓時高漲、結果收證價格較上日張七八磅音不等、印度棉市未能振作、咋日連同預測又跌二羅比餘、埃及跌三五磅昔、利物浦漲三便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　米跌又回</h3>
<p>杜粳米自隔咋午市一度轉　後、昨則開手以到貨見湧、由車輪運到五千餘包、人心突虛、且本鄉作客又都觀望、致市而遂難立足、轉呈下勢、一路貶降、而客家一見疲頽、允覺心餒、不的而同相互競脫以免虧耗、因之跌風愈跌愈熾、若新粳及密種百哥以隔昨猝提一元有奇、不無轟足、遂際此價貴銷滯、反響亦烈、收盤行情新粳較前竟削二三元之巨、而窰種百哥同瀉二元左右、破聲及陳新變元亦小一元左右、羊蘆尖跟粳帶落一元半、客尖早市去路較粳允呆、故開手即甩一元光景、一路疲頽、迄中市更鮮問津、各價竟落兀半、直至近午收市、在此須臾之際、突出木鄉作客及內地帮趁廉吸收、乃形勢激轉、反覺開動、價格回升、故收盤行情十二元、高三十元、中决廿七八元、新粳廿九元、决至廿五元半、蘇同崑破廿六七元、新粳廿八元至廿六元、靑角窰種三十元至廿九元、楓涇百哥廿八元、决至廿六元、特羊尖廿二元半、决至二十元、蘆尖特廿三元、决至廿一元、陳變允三十一元半至三十一元、新元廿五六元、江北尖特十九元、十八元半、南京一號尖十九元四五角、二號十九十九元、十八元八角、中十八元半、次十八元、至十七元半、統市成交數七千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈前日已見轉跌、咋因日商續有整票三千包拋出、人心更為虛軟、且被扣車米亦經全部放行、而放行之米既無意外費用、其受潮者反在市貶價求脫、客秈市面更遭影響、行情乃再度猛跌、比之前日又小一元至一元半不等，高客秈祇十九元半、决機秈十八元左右、行情雖小、人心仍虛、惟華商在江北與他埠販運者均已中止、蓋某方蓄意操縱民食、欲於大衆身上發一批財也、</p>
<h3>麵粉客銷尙活　小麥價昂貨稀</h3>
<p>粉銷路查客帮如天津港廈等處、需要不絕、惟廠方售慮甚堅、市上回籠貨棧單早已枯乏、故祇少數裝辦、市面形成擯持狀態、二號粉廠盤暫鮮變化、轉棧貨價在七元一角、比廠盤仍高角許、聞臼廠粉近疲遠緊、近期鳳凰牌價為六元九角左右、遠期價為七元三角、統市成交各粉倂計的有三萬包、查麵粉今日有二千包運往香港</p>
<p>麥來源較前略增、貨方以運輸困難、成本高昂、均擬上棧待價而沽、故市十流通貨反少、惟廠胃則以目下粉價難漲、亦不願放價吸收、故市面亦趨擯局、結果僅由囤戶辦進烏衣及常州麥二車、　價為十元零五角至叫角半、</p>
<h3>雜糧　芝麻囤戶活動　黃豆平穩如故</h3>
<p>近日芝蔴來源稍稀、去路出口雖觀望、但囤戶及凑做凈貨頗殷切、致市在貨戶緊扳之下、行情步升、咋市揚州蔴已開至二十八元五角、管店蔴三十二元、蕪湖蔴三十元零七角、共計成交各蔴一千三百餘包、黃豆到銷兩敵、市况平穩如恒、銷塲大都本街獨帮走化、出口去路祇有少數點綴而已、豆子今日有九百八十五包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>絲茶　白廠經　猛漲四百元</h3>
<p>日絲市木埠漲風方興朱艾　　　七八分昨已售開四七〇〇元空前　盤、與兩日前四三〇〇元相較、已猛漲四百元、　里經六個號子價二四〇〇元、達昌信孚各進持百担、國外絲市、橫濱停市、紐約漲風仍熾、近期貨咋漲一角二分，遠期漲九分半、上海絲廣東絲漲五分、日絲漲二分至五分、絲市前途變化、趨向堅俏方面、此點在本埠言、目下一般絲廠大多停工、生產囚原料問題而日蹙、市銷（包括囤貨）確隨絲價于品騰而漲、故絲價勢將登峯造極云、</p>
<p>東白鐵漲勢難熾</p>
<p>久趨平定之東白鐵、自各貨飛漲後、亦隨略漲、然其所漲之勢、却不甚猖熾也、咋市已由七元高至七元三角、（此三七尺貨）及函六元高至六元三角、（此三六尺貨）平均比前好起三角一張、查是貨去路以本街建築為最大、其他外埠客商如揚州溫州以及津烟靑三帮亦搜去有二三百紮之譜、</p>
<h3>市况彙誌</h3>
<p>海外銀儥仍降落　九日倫敦電、大條銀市步縮不止、近期縮一二五、遠期縮一作七五、近期有人補空交易、美商售出遠期、小有交易、市况平、收市後市面仍穩、少數照掛牌有成交、又紐約電、美銀價現貨縮二五、孟買電、印銀現貨與近期縮上二安那、遠期縮十四安那、市况平、成交單共五十張云、</p>
<p>貼現做過五十元　　劃票據貼現率、盤旋再跌、每千元之貼率、一度退至五十元最低價、晨初做五十五元半、繼步降至五十元、午刻始見回上至五十二元半、下午最後價為五十三元、比上日再軋小二元半、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均仍掛一角七分勿更云、</p>
<p>外幣賣氣忽濃密　咋日外幣市况仍不易抬頭、人心大都看小、賣氣仍濃、英金票又跌三角、美金票續降五分、安南票亦跌七分、法郎票小二厘、惟香港票漲五分、日金票大一厘、朝鮮票漲勢殊勁、卒以一元一角叫分五厘為同業互做價、結果軋漲二分五厘、餘俱不動、</p>
<p>海峯煤成交稀　海峯白煤、月初因鴻基跌價、曾一度軋低、外行囤戶、鑒於形勢不利、紛紛脫出、市塲頓感供過於求、但日來鑒於歐戰局勢緊張、後貨無定、行家又現觀望、不願輕售、故成交寥寥、同業棧單貨、大的一百七八元盤子、門市另售、篩塊　籮十六元云、</p>

<h3>日本國內　已遭逢空前困難　日美關係惡化貿易停滯　議員詰詢戰事何時可了</h3>
<p>楊格來滬之談片</p>
<p>大陸報云、國際通訊社遠東經理楊格、僑居日本、已逾十年、上星期三日抵滬小游、將取道華北·東三省·與朝鮮而返日、記者昨日（十九日）走訪之、據談稱、日本現遇黑暗之多季、因該國原料大缺、對外貿易、大受損失、政局杌隍不定、目與外國之關係不利故也、</p>
<p>缺乏外滙　挫折最重</p>
<p>日本經濟秩序之破裂、推源共故、皆因日政府犧牲健全國策、為在華軍事行動而採取不經濟之計劃所致、日本業已深感缺少或即將感覺短少之許多物品中、煤·電·水·亦在其列、惟防碍日本經濟系統之最嚴重挫折、厥為缺乏外匯、不能向外國購買一應入口品、</p>
<p>大豆輸德　陷於停頓</p>
<p>日本在東三省進行之工業程序、已受歐洲之嚴重打擊、緣東三省大豆輪出、已因歐戰而至少截斷其半數市塲、輸出乃减少四百萬噸、此四百萬噸大豆原係按照「滿洲國」與德國所訂商的而輸往穗國者、該商的定於十月一日實行、但因戰事而告停頓、故東三省自穗國獲得機械與其他必要入口品之希望、乃告頓挫、而不得不轉向美國等國家獲其所需之機械、然柬三省與日方均不能出此、以其無外匯償付貨價也、</p>
<p>外相野村　動遭掣肘</p>
<p>美商非得現款、即不以其產物售予日本，一九一一年美日商的之廢止、對於日本經濟力一嚴重打擊、日本外相野村為美總統羅斯福之私友、日本人民現望野村能解決美日間之懸案、野村之工作、將因「某數方而」之不同的觀念而大受妨礙、</p>
<p>美國拒絕　日本商品</p>
<p>同時日本商界鑒於美日兩國問近來在商業與外交上之發展、現恐美國不久將拒運任何商品赴日、渠離日本前兩星期內、盛傳美國財政部對於日本之金銀連同日人在華北取得者在內、不久或將一律停購、此外、並有美國若干製造商、已取銷臼本商行訂貨之大批定單、臼方購貨者難允照價增付現欶、然美國製造商仍取銷其定單、</p>
<p>遊覽事業　亦趨沒落</p>
<p>甚至日本之游歷貿易、今已將近零點、因日本警務當局對於柱游日本之旅客、加以嚴格限制、故外人游臼者、寥若晨星、渠近曾游日本西部、亦不足二百哩之路程內、遭警務密探五人之盤問、該區中現有密探八十人、從事監視旅客、且不久將另增七十人、其故為該區刻正迅趨工業化、而製造軍需品也、日政府近邀美國新聞記者雜誌撰稿員、與商人一百五十人赴日游覽、彼等離日時、對所遇之不便利、均發不平之言、</p>
<p>竭力宣傳　戰事速了</p>
<p>日政府進行廣泛之宣傳工作、謂在華戰事有光明之前途、並常使人民勿忘戰事不久將結束、而「新秩序」即將樹立、此種宣傳工作、諒已使日本民衆獲得有利之印象、日政府雖一再保證戰事將於「不久將來」結束、惟預料若干領袖即將詰問政府戰事究將於何時告終，今料或將向政府提出是項詰問者、係國會老議員尾崎與齋籐等人、明年一月國會重開時、此兩政治領袖對於政府政策、將大發議論、楊氏末稱、若目前之內閣倒臺、而召近衛復行出任首相、渠殊不以為奇、蓋日本今唯近衛始能鞭策「某數方面」也、在近衛領導之下、日木或將被迫與中國及美國商得若干確切之諒解、</p>
<h3>英軍武裝　巡邏界外</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、英軍乘卡車一輛、今（二十日）晨在近遭大道警察侵犯之界外馬路巡邏、軍上備白林式機關槍一挺、槍手守槍後、並有其他士兵八名、各執步槍、對於英軍防區內界外馬路上巡邏之大道警察、加以縝密注視、</p>
<h3>綸昌工潮　試行談判　並未陷於僵局</h3>
<p>大陸報云、英商綸昌公司之高級人員頃吾認昨（十九日）晨所傳解決浦東綸昌兩廠罷工之談判、仍陷僵局一說、據稱、公司與工人雙方代表之談判，今仍進行中、惟該員未預料談判將有何種結果、</p>
<h3>愚園路憶定盤路　華印捕被阻擊　華捕已殞命印捕亦垂危</h3>

<h3>圓瑛法師被捕　事前已有跡象　傳日方擬組織日華佛敎會　圓瑛拒任會長或因是被擄</h3>
<p>中國佛敎會理事長圓瑛法師、突於前臼午後零時三十分鐘、在大西路四四三號圓明　經堂內、彼日方挾架而去後、迄令日踪跡猶未明、上海佛敎界成甚震驚、茲將此事經過情形、分述如决、</p>
<p>原籍福建</p>
<p>圓瑛法師，係福建古田縣人</p>
<p>今年六十二歲、十九歲在福建石鼓山湧泉寺剃度出家、嗣囚在浙江寗波歷任接傳寺。天童寺。七塔寺·各叢林首席、故外間誤其為隸鄞縣籍者、職是故也、</p>
<p>領袖地位</p>
<p>渠在佛敎界中向有守舊派之稱、與太虛法師之維新派適相對立、惟中國佛敎會成立八年、除第一屆由太虛法師任理事長外、其餘七屆理事長一席、始終為圓瑛法師擔任、有佛敎界終身領袖之日、故見其在緇素叢中勢力之雄厚、有謂渠係太虛法師之徒者、藍完全不明佛敎界之情形也、</p>
<p>曾赴南洋</p>
<p>中日戰事起、此新舊兩佛敎領袖、太虛則　轉入　圓瑛則出國赴新加坡宣敎、查新加坡直落亞逸極樂寺原係福建鼓山湧泉寺下院、而渠現適任湧泉寺首席（即方丈）也、故彼卓錫至本年七月始回滬、原擬渡過秋節後、重回新加坡、不料歐戰突期、遂展綏行程、致有此次被架之發生</p>
<p>事前跡象</p>
<p>大西路四四三號圓瑛法師建有圓明講堂一所、為其平居臥息及講經之所、該堂屋宇閎敞、圓瑛自七月回滬後、即在該堂登壞說法多次、最近因風聞某方對渠有所企圖、始將該堂門外之牌額卸去、並停止繼續講經、事先防範、非不週至也、</p>
<p>突遭擄架</p>
<p>前日因適為該堂舉行佛七之期、上午起、即集有崇尙釋敎男女三十　餘人、圓瑛旋亦率　徒明掦（三十歲亦福建人）　堂、其時方預備施齋聚餐、詎突有穿西裝持手槍者七八人、（其間似雜有華人一名至二名、餘皆為日人、）猝然闖入、將羣衆驅至樓上、旋即將圓瑛及其徒明揚二人、挾登汽車而去、</p>
<p>原因揣測</p>
<p>迄作晨止、中國佛敎會及圓明講堂方而尙未明其下落、惟據佛敎界人士推測、當日此事未發生前、日方即有「日華佛敎會」組織、「總會」在東京、現在如杭州專淪陷區域已沒有「分會」、常時即醞釀脅迫圓瑛出任「會長」、惟卒為渠所拒絕、故北次被綁、衆信顯然與此事有關、</p>
<p>西報傳說</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、中國佛敎總會會長圓瑛法師、昨日（十九日）午後二時三十分左在大西路億定盤路轉角圓明講堂內遭便衣日人一隊逮捕、押往極司非爾路九十四號日憲兵總部、因渠被指在戰事期間本埠籌款十萬兀交中政府用以從事抗日戰事也、圓瑛法師雖承認曾籌得十萬元及其他大汪款項、惟堅稱此款絕未充軍費、而係援助傷兵者、中國佛敎領袖雖力圖營救圓瑛法師、惟至昨日深夜、渠仍被日方覊禁中、</p>
<h3>英人夫婦　被偽警扣留　歷三小時餘始釋</h3>
<p>字林報云、卜內門洋行職昌英人亞波特夫婦、星期三日被「特別市府」警察扣留事、咋日（十九日）已繕具詳細報告、曾交英領事當局、亞氏被禁三小時又三刻、其夫人被扣時間較短、事綠星朋三日亞氏夫婦策騎行於大西路相近華倫路處、亞氏坐騎、因汽車</p>
<p>馳過受驚</p>
<p>而自後撞及　自由車之華人一名、該華人一手指頭因而擦傷、當有「特別市府」警察三名、先後到塲、均不譜英譜、故亞氏夫婦不能向之解釋、但仍試圖告彼等謂渠欲返大西路障碍物前覓舌人、</p>
<p>亞氏夫婦</p>
<p>卒與三警同行、至英軍防區前、英哨兵一名、明瞭該兩外僑　於窘境、乃通知警務處某西捕頭、轉報靜安寺捕房與英軍司令部、同時、又有「特別市府」警察數名及警，官一人到塲、亞夫人欲</p>
<p>越障碍物</p>
<p>而人英軍防區、惟時一特別市府」警官攫住亞夫人一臂、不許其入內、嗣有某外僑出面斡旋、亞夫人始得曳騎越障碍物而人英軍防區、亞氏卒被押入大西路「特別市府警局鞠詢、被稱至午後二時四十五分、</p>
<p>始准返寓</p>
<p>當時從事磋商者、有華人·日人·公共租界醫務處·與英軍·四方面、英軍司令部之代表係上海區英軍司令西蒙斯少將與對日軍關袼官亨寺少交</p>

<p>要求展期</p>
<p>據吳陳兩氏談、此次來滬、與法方接洽辦理放行滯海防貨物問題、已數度謁見法總領事鮑黛芝氏、惟關於耍求機續展緩登記辦理簽證問題、法領署准予本月底截止、本人等因事關上海華商利害頗鉅、雖曾一再提出、但迄未得要領、故至本月底是吾可以再行展期、則殊無把握、本人等擬於日內即行返防、將在滬接洽經過、報告當道、以憑核奪、</p>
<p>商人損失　數字驚人</p>
<p>上海進口商前向德奧捷所採購之各種貨物、為數頗鉅、九月三日英法對德宣戰後、在海防被法扣留之貨、不下七八萬噸、而屬於上海華商者的佔十分之六、囤積該處將近兩月、商家經濟、為之擱淺、其痛苦自難言宣、今既蒙當局通融放行、一般進口商聞悉之餘、莫不喜形於色、故今日紛紛垂詢疏運辦法、以期早日遝到銷售、而免損失、惟法領署限於本月底前辦理登記、倘過期不登記者、即行充公、故現仍在請求再予展限、但是吾允准、殊難逆料、總之、甚望進口商勿過於疏忽、儘先前往登記、以避免無形損失、若遭充公、則其損失數字殊堪驚人也、</p>

<h3>長江綫日輪　分段行駛　赴漢須用「軍票」　遊擊區域多受累</h3>
<p>滬漢間長江航綫、被日軍侵佔後、洋商輪船、迄無復航希望、但日輪之運輸、非常繁盛、長江綫前由日淸公司獨家航行、現已改歸日方東亞海運株式會社新組織、聞將長江全綫、劉分數段、如上海南京錢、上海蕪湖綫、上海九江綫、上海漢口錢等、對中國乘客、已可至九江、惟赴漢口者、須經「軍部」准許、方可乘船、船票價格、均以日鈔計算、茲聞該公司近通告對於安慶上游（即安慶以上各地）、日幣法幣概不通用、須以「軍票」（即軍用票）通用、如帶法幣一律拒絕云云、日人此舉、可見日本資金之窘狀、但上游遊擊區域受害非淺、</p>

<p>謠傳迄今　幾及一年</p>
<p>自聞美國海事委員會擬於十年以上之期內、建新輪五百艘以代舊商輪後、太平洋兩岸論傳美國刻正建造超等巨輪者、幾已一年、該三輪之建造期、將歷三載、但於開航後、太平洋共他輪船之大小與速率、均將非其匹敵、蓋三輪且　凌三萬九千噸之「日本皇后號」巨輪之上也、今三輪俱未命名、其全長各計七百四十呎、具六萬五千匹馬力、航速每小時二十六海里、能載客九百八十五人、設備殊為華美、</p>
<p>新輪六艘　環航全球</p>
<p>惟遠在此三輪行駛之前、美總統輪船公司將有較小之環航全球輸六艘落成、各一六·一九〇噸、最高航速十六海里半、長四百九十二呎、其中一艘名海箭號、已於七月間入水、或將於明年八月處女航中抵滬、預料其姊妹愉五艘、將開始每隔兩週之環球航務、美國海事委員會擬派新輪共二十艘、定期航行遠東、此項計劃、已離實現不遠、</p>
<p>海事委會　整個計劃</p>
<p>如普奇桑特東方輸船公司（譯普）之柯特白洛克號輪、星期三日駛抵上海、而開始自美國西海岸出發之每三週載貨航務、該輪之姊妹輪計有薩太蒂亞號。卡必洛號。與科林胡斯號三艘、薩太蒂亞號三週前駛來遠東、未駛上海、而共他兩輸、則將隨柯特白洛克號而定期航行遠東、聞柯特白洛克號之載貨地位、已經美航商於數星期前預定、載來上海之貨物的二千噸、多為木材、至於海事委員會所定航行遠東之二十艘輪中、除上述諸輪外、所剩最後七艘、尙在未定階段、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>跑  秦佬</h3>
<p>偶然在舊雜誌上看見了一位學者底文章，說他對於車夫非常看不起，因爲他們一看見巡捕要來干涉了，便甚麼道理也不知道去講，只是撒腿一跑完事，文章底結論是：民　只知道跑。</p>
<p>這謝非極不錯的。民衆當到自己是赤手空拳又沒有成爲團體的時候，一看見握着有武器而可以空制自己生命的人，自然只有一跑。試間不跑等甚麼呢？凖備挨批或坐牢，是可以不跑的。但可惜人都有自衛的本能，雖然就是車夫罷，也決不會蠢到安心挨打或坐牢。講道理自然是最漂亮的一着，但可惜車夫不是學者，講道量的本領又很不高明，而且就是高明，對而的人也未必肯聽，結果是除了跑，實在沒有別種法子的。</p>
<p>民衆只知道跑。——誰敢說這話不對呢？遇到捉，他們跑。遇到剿，他們跑。遇到炸，他們更跑。看看歷史上的大事變，要是只着眼於民衆底跑，那便幾乎是「跑的歷史」：最早，大兵一追，大家都往山裏跑；以後，地方大了，大家便都往海邊跑。有時候是城裏的人向鄕間跑，有時候又是鄕間的人向城裏跑。現在有租界了，於是成千成萬的難民便向租界上跑。</p>
<p>這些，學者自然都看不起的。因爲學者首先是知道講道理，其次就是不講道理，也用不着跑。在歷史上，我們憶經看看了不少：新主子至，學者就先獻文，上策，或者等着「垂詢」和「推　」，住得安穏極了。現在呢，——不必說吧。</p>
<p>不過學者對於民衆的觀察，却並不見得是正確的。他只看見赤手空拳又沒有成爲團體的民衆，而沒有看見手裏也有了武器並且成了隊伍的民衆。——到了那時的民衆，就不是只知道跑了。他們只知道衝。</p>
<p>民衆底跑是我們常見的；民衆底衝，我們却不常見。但要見也容易；中要你逼到他們儘管跑，跑得無可再跑的時候，他們就會同身給你衝起來的。到那時，學者只怕又嚇得要跑了。</p>
<p>看歷史，只着眼於民衆底跑，自然是「跑的歷史」。但實際上每一個新的時代，却都是中民衆衝出來的。衝了以後，偉人出來了，於是民衆開始只知道跑。——自然，這時，學者又會回來的。於是他再到馬路上去看見車夫不知道講道理，只知道跑，表示自己底看不起。</p>
<h3>辯論  唐韋</h3>
<p>—刦灰拾記—</p>
<p>程是牽牛房有名的雄辯家，他到了不久，又開始一塲惡辯。</p>
<p>老蕭，丟開手裏的琵琶，蘭結着兩片薄薄的嘴唇，不大有光澤的眼睛，惡意的旺着他。石語也在平心靜氣傾聽程的發言。……除了老冲之外，大家都和火綫上的兵士一樣，思維密切的連結着耳朶。</p>
<p>『這一次關於「長相思」（註）的爭論，公磊的態度雖前敵好，但是對於　章　體」與「段節制度」上我覺得老黑是失敗了！』他看看羣不在塲，就又加上一句：『石頭記，水滸都是章　體，能够說它比蔣光慈的作品價値低嗎？』</p>
<p>『不能這樣比，你該知道時代不是個定型的玩藝兒：我底一篇「章　體是否尙屬現肛小說的範疇」申也提到了這個問題！』</p>
<p>今天老蕭的氣度來得和藹，他不停的往嘴唇上蘸着吃得唾沫。</p>
<p>『那末你說藝術的價値，還有時間的限制嗎？』</p>
<p>『當然有時間限制！』石語和老蕭回答的。</p>
<p>『我不同意，只要是一件成功的藝術呂，無論到什麼時候都有它的藝術價値。』</p>
<p>『這話也有點道理！』</p>
<p>融秋猛吸一口冷氣，一雙金魚眼睛鏡後邊忽忙的轉了一個彎彎。</p>
<p>『扯談……你應該知道所謂藝術價値在這一個時代，和那一個時代之間，已經有了成分上的差別啦！』</p>
<p>『你不懂，乙靡有資格來辯論。』</p>
<p>『問題越走越遠！』老沖申插說『總之成功的作品，它不僅有藝術性，同時還有社會性！鄭孝胥的建國宣言，文筆那麼漂亮，我相信，無論到什麼的代也不會有價値的！』</p>
<p>他用一條紅絲巾，在腦袋上扎了一個長髻，引得全堂哄笑起來。</p>
<p>雖然已經掉換話題，老蕭還始終不痛快，靡過幾分鐘，他把那頂　帽，往腦袋上一丟，拖着愛人的胳膊走掉了。</p>
<p>註：「長相思」爲哈爾濱國際協報記者公磊（卽在天津蒙雖的申報記者公敢）所寫的章　體長篇小說，因舒羣的批評，曾引起一度激烈的筆戰。</p>

<h3>鄕土  樓蘭</h3>
<p>我知道的一個故事，其實倒是一件實事。</p>
<p>說是有一個人樸風塵，東西流浪，如行脚僧人，一　長長的日子織成了一段無休止的旅程。</p>
<p>也許由於不耐長途的跋涉，或者是感到了厭倦，一天，他突然地病倒於茅店中。晨光朦朧，雞鳴破曉，他却不能照常趕路了。數夜旅夢，不知帶來了什麼天地？夢境中的摸索或許拾得了什麼？之後，他竟收住那份野心，回到自己的鄕土，安份的過着日子，隠居不出了。</p>
<p>「胡馬依北風，越鳥朝南枝」，而人也少不了有鄕土之思。縱然曾飄蕩江湖半世，如這小故事中的主人。</p>
<p>當你靜靜地坐在椅子上，或者漫步於園子裏的時候，一件平常的東西惹起了你的注意，你凝視着，竟遠遠的神往了；無論如何也拉不回想像的脚，故鄕的庭園，樓台已出現於眼前。</p>
<p>鄕土的魔力誘引着流浪人的心。你可會忘記過家園的氣息？</p>
<p>我耳邊縈繞着熟悉的歌聲：「松花江上」。牠把我的想像牽到遼遠的彼方。在那裏曾經有一個便我溫暖過的巢窠呢！雛燕南飛，故居已毀。但却怎能飄起家園的深憂？</p>
<p>我憶念着自己的鄕土。「雖有舊夢，不願重溫。」的確不失爲健壯，踏實的心境；但，懷念如不流爲感傷，也可以成爲支持戰鬥的力量。</p>
<p>烽火燃遍原野，鐵蹄馳於大地，朋友，何處是凈土？家鄕無恙否？</p>
<h3>催眠曲  柳攸</h3>
<p>夜</p>
<p>聰明的阿波羅却也給予人類一支，使之感到柔美而沉然的催眼曲。</p>
<p>催眠曲對於幼稚的孩子是偉大的，茲母最需要千萬支　曲中這小小的一支，當她們的孩子感到不耐煩，吚啞地亂嚷時，祗有使他們聽到那清柔溫和的美麗的歌，使他們得到不枯燥的感覺，而入夢鄕了。</p>
<p>失去了童年後，睡眠已不似幼時那樣長久，人們戀着工作，懷着事業，在緊張時，常犧牲了必要的睡眠時間，因之偶眠曲被屛棄了，牠不能列入成人的歌中。</p>
<p>爲了不虛度寶貴的一生，人們酷愛不易得的光陰，決不願以　睡磨，在聞得催眠曲時，便生了厭惡，憎恨。</p>
<p>催眠曲似乎不知道這些，牠被另一些人們利用了，將他們變得分外的艷麗，含着不可思議的誘惑力，將牠們作爲麻醉人們的鴆酒，以求達到那些人的目的，使他們能壓迫他人，征服他人。</p>
<p>在前進的人們，留心這一支催眠曲啊！</p>
<h3>拾荒人  舍芒</h3>
<p>拿棉　黑的破鈎，</p>
<p>蹀　在暗環的街道；</p>
<p>破靴默數着沉重步武，</p>
<p>背後黑幢的竹篾籠高聳。</p>
<p>蓬　的長髪衝開破帽，</p>
<p>稜稜唇日在僨張的鬍髭裏噏動；</p>
<p>更透露出貪婪眼光，</p>
<p>眼就像黑夜黑貓底瞳孔。</p>
<p>向汚穢叢中走近，</p>
<p>呌蒼蠅撲上面，粘上身，</p>
<p>長褲管拖過潭潭汚水，</p>
<p>破衣惹上腐骨屑與土　。</p>
<p>手帮着破鈎翻聞層層垃圾渣滓，</p>
<p>貪婪的眼光　射　怨恨，</p>
<p>誰看不見平坦華麗的街道，</p>
<p>却要向這薰天的臭氣走近。</p>
<p>誰沒有家園鄕土，</p>
<p>誰沒有最蜜愛的親人；</p>
<p>然而一切都燃燒在　鬼手裏，</p>
<p>心頭就只留着難忘的仇恨。</p>
<p>萬千結結在苦縐的眉頭，</p>
<p>萬千結表出萬千底內心。</p>
<p>不怕路人翻起白眼吆喝，詛咒和踢　，</p>
<p>更不理會掩着鼻　過來的憐惜眼光，</p>
<p>理　呑下　斛酸辛淚，</p>
<p>淚把憤恨添上把步武加强。</p>
<p>從黃昏　到深黑，</p>
<p>黑夜裏敎夢魂也不得安息；</p>
<p>要冒着夜凄其把破金屬從臭氣中拾起，</p>
<p>明天，曙光到來的時候　成復仇的鋼刀！</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>虞洽老娶孫媳婦</h3>
<p>— 南腔北調人</p>
<p>——盛大堂會全滬名仱戳力拍演——</p>
<p>本月二十三日，爲虞洽卿先生的文孫虞積　君大婚之日，（積澐係順恩先生公子虞門中長子長孫）假座南京路新都飯店，洽老以國事蜩　，不願過事舖張，事前極守秘密，至昨日各方始接獲其請柬，伶界中人得此消息，以洽老平日之待伶界中人十分恩厚，乃自動發起，演一台好戲給洽老看。海上各舞台藝員，一律參加，天蟾舞台，共舞台，大舞台，因演本戲關係，晚上無空，乃合演白天戲，（劇目正在酌奪中）黃金大戲院方面，由宋德珠演「水漫金山寺」帶打出手，卡爾登頭脾角兒周信芳，共舞台頭牌角兒趙如泉合演「戰長沙」，周之黃忠，趙之關公，特煩黃金名凈袁世海飾魏延，南北名伶合作，搭配齊整之至。更新方面，山吳素秋演紡棉花，這都是已定的劇目。</p>
<p>是日將新都飯店全部包下，日戲二時開　至八時止，八時至十二時由票友彩　，十二時後，再山各舞台名角演出，演至天明爲止，但各藝員都係自動的參加，關於班底配角零　開銷，都自　腰包，不要主人攪脫一隻銅板，這一點，就可見虞洽老平日對伶界中人是如何之好！否則，决不有這樣盛大的大堂會演出，人家化了多大銀子都邀不齊哩！</p>
<p>班底用伍月華韓金奎班底合組的金玉堂，金玉堂係新創的一副衣箱，角色齊全，行頭嶄新，伍韓二位，也爲了孝敬虞洽老起見，全部義務。</p>
<p>海上長久沒有好堂會看了，而這决虞洽老辦喜事的堂會，並非出於主動而出於被動，都是伶界中人自動發起的，更可見阿德哥之偉大。</p>
<h3>孤島劇話　——從戰濮陽說起</h3>
<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>上星期在黃金，看過一　吳彥衡的「戰濮陽」。「戰濮陽」是富連成科班的獨有佳劇，劇中的主角呂布，本來歸武小生應行，富　成的學生中，演這齣戲算茹富蘭第一。茹富蘭在科的時候，本來學的是武小生（出科後才改爲武生的）演這齣戲，和韓富信（工武凈出科後久佔天津在津頗負佳譽）的典韋搭配，有二難之目。富蘭出科以後，雖改武生，但是「戰濮陽」他仍然演唱。於是久而久之，這齣戲的呂布，就變成小生武生兩行兼工。</p>
<p>茹富蘭之後，當連成叫科中，有兩個人演這齣戲：一個是武生楊盛春，一個是小生葉盛蘭。</p>
<p>盛春這齣戲，是他得意之作，時常貼演；盛蘭這齣戲，並不亞於盛春，可是他不常貼演，最近幾年，盛春盛蘭來滬，都在黃金大戲院演過這齣戲。不過這齣戲的典韋曹操，和呂布佔同樣重要的地位，盛春盛蘭在滬所演，不是沒有好典韋，就是沒有好曹操，（楊盛春演是劉盛常的曹換，葉盛蘭演是黃金班底張慶才的曹躲，）所以演來，因爲搭配不齊之故，未見如何精彩。昨觀吳彥衡所演，由袁世海飾曹操，程少餘　典韋，彥衡此　雖不能媲美茹富蘭，而在楊葉之上，加以搭配齊整，故是日演出，益見精彩。</p>
<p>彥衡有嗓子，有扮相。飾呂奉先，可謂恰到好處，世海之曹操，得郝壽臣之眞傳，自非他伶所及。程少餘之典韋，與彥衡對打，雖尚欠純熟，但臉譜美觀，扮相魁梧，恰合大將身分。惟台上無火彩，致世海少去不少身段，而劇情方面亦因而差勁，此實美巾不足也。彥衡此戲，因配角關係，不常露演。此外如演「翠屛山」「棲梧山」「賈家樓」等戲，則此决尚未公演。</p>

<h3>舞团寫影</h3>
<p>— 小田　（四六）</p>
<p>漫談兩舞星</p>
<p>平劇珠簾！裏二王娘對李克用道：「得勝回來，另有好處，」因爲李克用是沙陀國王，論位則尊，　財則富，所以按不上　賞二字，祇得說另有好處了。舞客對於舞女，可以說多給銀錢，按到實際就是個「賞」字，舞女對舞客呢，當然祇有拿「好處」來作相對條件了。諸位可千萬別想到歪麥失，二王娘給李克用的好處，不過是白一席酒，姐妹倆陪着一喝。至於舞女們給舞客們的好處，其中輕重大小，千狀萬態，不可一例而論，一時也寫不盡，總之，是「好處罷了。</p>
<p>本文所說兩位舞星的最大好處，就是不吃客人的豆腐，不拿客人當寃大頭，兩個人作風雖然不同，主義倒是一樣的。她們是誰呢？一位是百樂門的趙雪芳，一位是大都會的茹愛娜，茹愛娜　態可掬，容貌　麗，她家裏有一個爺，一個娘，還有兩個洋囡囡，這是她很得意地告訴我的。據說，二年前有一位客人要和她訂嫁娶之盟，並且是做正室，但要她即時輟舞入學，讀過二年書，再行舉行婚禮，結果，女方不肯。有人問我，爲什麽當舞女的老喜歡當舞女呢？我說，這是飽人不知飢人苦的話，試想當她輟舞的時候，這一筆家庭生活費，從何而出呢。趙雪芳明眸善睞，儀態萬方，家裏有一位老娘，一弟一妹，菽水之奉，敎育之費，都靠她兩脚所入。在背人的時候，常常雙眉　促，有些西子雉心之態，好像有什麽隱憂似的。她們　不肯向客人敲一記　頭，斧頭更不敢動了，生意都相當的好。客人如果對她們有相當的報效，她們也會還給你相當的好處，有一位朋友說：「這話有些不對，我在趙雪芳身上用了不少的錢，可是始終沒有得到什麽好處。」我說：「這思想錯了，她們陪你玩樂，陪你吃喝，和你說笑，使你忘憂，使你不感寂寞，這還不算好處嗎？祇要她不是和你吃豆腐，不向你開條斧，你的錢就算化得不寃。」</p>
<p>末了，我必須附帶聲明，並非別的舞星沒有這種好處，更不是除了茹愛娜和趙雪芳，就沒有好人了，舞國中人，好人多得很呢，我不過偶然發現，本着隱惡揚善的聖訓，來譽揚兩句罷了。</p>

<p>烏龍院劇中的金銀問題</p>
<p>梁山的晁天王及羅家哥弟，因爲感念宋三爺在她們刦生辰綱時曾有救命之恩，所以才命劉唐下書，冒着絕大的危險，預備聘請宋江上山爲王，以盡他們飲水思源報答大恩的一片誠意；同時還與他帶來黃金一錠，聊充謝儀或川資等用。其實要論宋江保全他們七條人命的舊恩，當然一錠黃金還算太薄，不過有請他上山爲王的這種的會，縱令劉唐忽忙間隨身携帶的禮物菲薄一些，也就於理無乖了。况且他們根本就未認定區區一錠金子足以表示他們感謝的意思，這也不過是順便給宋三哥帶點路費罷了。可是以晁蓋那種梁山天王的地位，既然特地命劉唐帶點銀錢給宋江，那末，一錠銀子是無論如何拿不出手的。何况宋三爺也是一位交游廣闊，疏財仗義的好朋友，爲了一個閻婆惜，就隨便花了三百兩銀子買她到家，後又建造起一爿烏龍院，用銀當亦不少。倘使劉唐在酒樓上交罷書信之後，跟手奉上的一隻元寶僅是至多不過五十兩的白銀的話，我想花過錢見過錢的宋三爺一定不會正眼相視，並且還連聲道謝拒由後受的。再者說金銀的重量大相懸殊，則元寶的大小，也就相差甚鉅；要說那是一隻五十兩重的銀兀寶，恐怕招文袋裏也不便安放，同時也更不能任令閻婆惜的織織玉手隨便用兩個手指撿取出來，又隨便向懷裏一塞的。（一二四）</p>

<h3>Grue Ambassador Warns Japan: The United States is Determined to Uphold its Rights in China, Sternly Rejecting Japan's So-called 'New Order in East Asia'. Atrocities by Japanese Troops Deeply Abhorred by the American Government and Public</h3>
<p>Tokyo - American Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grue, during a luncheon hosted by the America-Japan Society this afternoon, provided a frank explanation of the relationship between the United States and Japan. The core of his statement was, "The American people are determined to safeguard their long-established rights in China." Grue had recently returned from the United States, and no fewer than seven hundred dignitaries attended the luncheon to hear his remarks. The American ambassador, after stating that he did not wish to dwell on trivial matters to bore his audience, said, "I believe there is no one here who is unaware that American public opinion is greatly dissatisfied with certain actions of the Japanese military in China today, such as infringing upon the rights and legitimate interests of Americans in China." He continued, stating that these facts were well-known by both the American government and public, and that for the sake of future interests between Japan and the United States, such matters must be addressed. Unless constructive steps are taken to change this situation, how can relations between the two countries improve? Grue further stated that Americans believe in equal commercial opportunities throughout the world. While Japan demands and benefits from the Open Door policy in regions outside of China, in China it claims that this principle is not applicable. Even if there are exceptions, they are merely incomplete and lifeless formalities. Grue also said that the Japanese side often accuses the American government and public of not understanding the "New Order in East Asia." In reality, the American government and public understand the meaning of this new order as clearly and precisely as Japan does. Japanese officials explain this "New Order" as an order of security, stability, and progress, which is what the American government and public desire not only for themselves but for all countries in the world. However, this "New Order in East Asia" apparently seeks to exclude the long-established rights and interests of Americans in China, which is what the American people oppose. The American ambassador concluded by stating that his views accurately represent and convey the general sentiment of the American government and public. American public opinion regarding recent developments in the Far East is nearly unanimous, based on facts rather than propaganda. This nationwide consensus is a force that the American government cannot ignore and will ultimately reflect in its policies and actions.</p>
<p>After strongly asserting that the American people are increasingly disgusted with the methods employed by the Japanese military in China, the ambassador continued, stating that Americans are deeply shocked by Japan's indiscriminate bombing. The reason for the shock in American public opinion is not only for humanitarian reasons but also because it directly endangers the lives and property of Americans, causing Americans to lose their lives and become disabled. Americans have become increasingly concerned about the Japanese military in China disregarding treaties and agreements signed by several nations, including Japan, and infringing upon and interfering with American rights. Americans not only feel troubled by the deprivation of their deeply rooted rights, such as equal opportunity and fair treatment, but also feel that the current trend in the Far East, if it continues unabated, will shatter their hopes for the development of an orderly world. The American ambassador continued, stating that American interests in China are currently being damaged and undermined by the policies and actions of the Japanese authorities in China. American property is being damaged daily, and American expatriates are being placed in danger and insulted. If I were to provide a detailed account of the above matters, you would undoubtedly feel that the attitude held by Americans is steady and fully justified. In short, the American people, based on the reliable evidence they have obtained, have ample reason to believe that Japan, for its own benefit, is currently striving to establish control over a vast area of the Asian continent and to implement a closed economic system in that area. The aforementioned situation, coupled with the bombing, insults, and various interferences with American rights, is the reason for the attitude of the American people towards Japan today. It is my belief, and the belief of the American government and people, that many of the harmful incidents inflicted by Japanese personnel on America are entirely unnecessary. We firmly believe that the true security and stability of the Far East can only be achieved without violating any American rights. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Welcomed by People in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - People from all walks of life here in China have welcomed the speech delivered by American Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grue, in Tokyo, stating that its content frankly clarifies the policy and attitude of the United States in the Far East. It also provides Japanese people with an opportunity to hear the candid opinions of foreigners regarding the actions of the Japanese military in China and the world's opinion on various activities of Japan in China. Ambassador Grue's speech has aroused widespread commentary and left a very good impression among the Chinese people. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Negative Reactions from Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Today, various newspapers here criticized the speech by American Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grue, regarding the attitude of the United States towards Japan's policy in China. "Chugai Commercial News" criticized the American ambassador's speech, stating that this formal expression of American views proves that the United States is resolutely and decisively opposing Japan's position and determination to build a new order in East Asia, betting the fate of the nation on it, both formally and substantially. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that while the "frankness" of the American ambassador's speech is commendable, the prejudices and misunderstandings in American public opinion urgently need to be frankly corrected. "Miyako Shimbun" stated that Japan is firmly determined to advance and fulfill its lofty mission of building a new order in East Asia, regardless of American public opinion. "Kokumin Shimbun" strongly asserted that it would be foolish to be intimidated by American public opinion. The Japanese government should assess the situation between the United States and Japan based on the true circumstances and promote the construction of the new order in East Asia. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of a Sino-Soviet Alliance: Purely Japanese Propaganda</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Well-informed Chinese sources from all walks of life stated that rumors circulating abroad that China and the Soviet Union are about to conclude a military agreement and that the Soviet Union is stationing troops in Xinjiang are Japanese propaganda. These rumors were carefully crafted by the Japanese to shake British policy in the Far East and were spread opportunely just before and after the arrival of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr in Chongqing. The timing was particularly clever. The Japanese also spread rumors that the British ambassador is currently urging the National Government to peacefully resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict. This is the ultimate goal of this Japanese propaganda. Seeing that their plan has failed, that Britain is unwilling to act as a mediator, and that it cannot pressure China to negotiate with Japan, they are now trying to intimidate Britain with rumors that the Soviet Union is about to control China. Therefore, the Japanese are currently broadcasting rumors that China and the Soviet Union are about to conclude a military agreement and that Soviet troops are concentrating in Xinjiang, attempting to force China to accept their demands. The Japanese hope to use this to arouse the concern of the great powers about the expansion of Soviet power in China and pressure the National Government to make peace with Japan in order to eliminate the possibility of the Soviet Union gaining control in China. According to well-informed observers, everything Japan has been doing in China has completely failed. Therefore, they are racking their brains to create rumors in order to bring the Sino-Japanese war to an early end. (Reuter's dispatch, [Day unclear])</p>
<p>Washington - Officials in Washington yesterday declined to comment on reports from Chinese sources that China and the Soviet Union may sign a military alliance. According to the report, a Soviet military delegation arrived in Chongqing this week for the purpose of negotiating a military alliance between the two countries. However, well-informed sources here believe that the mission of the Soviet military delegation to China will be largely limited to the role of military advisors. Some believe that China and the Soviet Union may negotiate an agreement stipulating that the Soviet Union will supply goods to China, but they doubt that the two countries will soon conclude a full military alliance. Observers here believe that a Sino-Soviet military agreement would be a major factor in future Anglo-Japanese relations. It is said that Britain and Japan have been considering the new relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany. It is generally believed that if Soviet economic aid to Germany hinders the effectiveness of the British blockade of Germany, then Britain will attempt to move closer to Japan. However, most observers doubt that any new development can cause the United States or Britain to reduce their sympathy towards China. American public opinion towards the Soviet Union is wavering due to two different problems. The eastern states express strong sympathy for the Baltic and North Sea states and therefore want to resist Soviet aggression, but the western states are influenced by the Soviet Union's attitude, believing that the Soviet Union can resist Japan's expansion.

<h3>Sino-Soviet Relations Difficult to Improve: Rumors of New Clashes on the Mongolian Border</h3>
<p>The Hague - It is reported that Soviet and Japanese troops have once again engaged in hostilities on the Manchurian-Mongolian border. Observers here are all surprised by this. "Handelsblad" also published an editorial, stating, "The truce agreement on the Manchurian-Mongolian border signed by the Soviet Union and Japan on the 8th of this month has now become invalid. This was not what most people expected. It can be seen from this that all the disputes between the two countries have not been resolved. Here, we cannot help but ask: Did the Soviet Union sign the truce agreement in order to delay time so that it could consolidate its position in Europe? Will it now actively develop in the Far East, driving the Japanese forces eastward, just as it is driving the German forces westward in Europe? In other words, will the Soviet Union actively assist China, forcing Japan to surrender, and thereby seek to gain leadership in Asian politics? In short, it can be asserted that the current actions of the Soviet Union have focused on the Far East." (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>British Military Preparations in the Far East</h3>
<p>The situation facing Britain today is quite different from that during the last Great War. The fires of war in the Far East ignited two years ago. While the friend who previously served as her Far Eastern "watchdog" is now betting everything on military action on the Asian continent, her mind is still focused on how to strike at British power in order to fulfill her dream of dominating Asia. How to realize her ambition to advance south, so that she can occupy a place in the resource-rich South Seas to compensate for her inherent economic deficiencies. Therefore, Britain has her direct enemy, Germany, in Europe, and another hostile force in Asia. This force is currently bogged down in China, and although its piecemeal looting and oppression cause Britain some losses, it does not pose a major threat to Britain. However, its consistent policy of aggression and its concealed ambitions cannot be said to be a source of future concern for Britain. Because many of Britain's Far Eastern colonies, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, and autonomous territories, such as New Zealand and Australia, are only separated by a narrow strip of water from Japan's naval bases. Japan's fleet can attack these places as quickly as it can reach them. As one New Zealand political commentator said, "We now know that the so-called Far East is just the near north for us. Science is gradually eliminating the limitations of space, and our security will be unreliable due to the policies and actions of the expansionist faction in the Japanese navy. The distance we should estimate for a naval attack is not the distance between Yokohama and Sydney, but the distance between Palau and New Guinea."</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time when the flames of war are raging in Europe, how to protect her eastern territories is a matter of great concern to those in the British government. Before the outbreak of the European war, as many as 8,000 troops were transferred from India to Singapore. Recently, according to Singapore Governor Thomas's report, British defense forces continue to arrive from India. The purpose of this troop transfer, according to British Imperial Indian Affairs Minister Zetland's explanation in the House of Lords, is that "this measure was adopted after the urgent recommendation of the naval and army authorities, because at that time, the security of India seemed to be threatened from the east. From a military point of view, it is necessary to strengthen the points of access to India from both the east and west." The so-called western threat refers to the southward advance of Germany and the Soviet Union, while the eastern threat certainly does not refer to China.</p>
<p>British military preparations in the Far East were decided at the defense conference held in Singapore in June this year. The purpose of this conference was to form a Pacific Defense Committee to coordinate cooperation between the British forces in New Zealand, Australia, and the South Pacific. The conference was composed of three representatives from New Zealand, Australia, and the British Empire, and a military representative was appointed. Thereafter, the forces commanded by this body included the British fleet stationed in China, the Royal Australian Navy and the New Zealand Navy, the Royal Air Force in the Far East, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the military forces stationed in various colonies in the Far East and the Pacific. Another main purpose of this conference was to create an independent Eastern army. In the event of an emergency, it could fight independently without relying on the replenishment of manpower and material supply from the British Empire itself. For this reason, autonomous territories such as New Zealand and Australia have also been accelerating the expansion of their naval and air forces in recent years in step with their mother country. In the naval field, the Australian government currently has five new-style cruisers and five destroyers. There are also two destroyers under construction, as well as a coastal defense fleet. The number of sailors on the ships is approximately 6,000. As for the air force, there are 212 aircraft and 3,000 pilots. There is also an aircraft factory that can produce 400 combat aircraft annually in peacetime and up to 1,000 aircraft in wartime. New Zealand's development of its air force is also extremely rapid, and it also has an aircraft factory.</p>
<p>Another point that deserves our attention is that France participated in this conference and both sides agreed to close cooperation between the two countries' naval, land, and air forces in the Far East. France and Australia also have a tacit understanding that France's territories along the Pacific coast can be used by Australia for defense for military reasons. As for the Dutch East Indies, which has close relations with British colonies in the Far East, although the Netherlands takes a neutral stance on European events, it cannot remain aloof from its East Indian colonies and must join this group to jointly cope with foreign aggression.</p>
<p>Military matters often contain some secrecy, which cannot be fully understood by outsiders. However, given the British national character of pragmatism, we can be confident that the above-mentioned British military deployments in the East are not merely a show of force. In other words, as a result of close cooperation between the three countries of Britain, France, and the Netherlands, as well as their autonomous territories and colonies, there is at least no need to worry about foreign aggression. From this, it can be inferred that although the widely circulated Anglo-Japanese joint declaration and Anglo-Japanese restoration of the alliance have not been acknowledged by the British side, or are considered unworthy of acknowledgement because they are worthless rumors, with military strength as the backing of diplomacy, if the military is confident and fearless, diplomacy does not have to kneel down and beg for perfection. Various rumors are naturally unnecessary to believe lightly. Moreover, looking at the overall situation, first, British compromise with Japan and British expectations for the United States are fundamentally incompatible, how can Britain get both? To say that Britain would rather alienate the United States and befriend Japan is an inconceivable situation. Second, it is good to have more friends. Any country at war seeks to have fewer enemies. This is an iron rule. But the Far East has been at war for more than two years, and the European war is only fifty days old. At a time when Japan wants to end its war against China but cannot, it dares not go to war with Britain or any other country. In fact, it is far more than Britain in the European war dares not go to war with Japan. In comparison, Britain will not kneel down. This is the obvious conclusion after examining the cooperation between Britain and France and the Netherlands and the completion of military deployments in the East!</p>

<h3>Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty Signed; Does Not Apply to the Soviet Union; Chamberlain Announces Victory in Negotiations</h3>
<p>Constantinople, Turkey—This afternoon, England, France, and Turkey signed a mutual assistance treaty here, consisting of nine articles and one statement, exempting Turkey from any obligation to engage in armed conflict with the Soviet Union. The articles are as follows: (1) If Turkey is invaded, England and France must assist. (2) If Turkey, England, and France are all drawn into war in the Mediterranean as a result of an act of aggression, they must assist each other. (3) If Turkey is at war due to England and France fulfilling their guarantees to Greece and Romania, Turkey must assist England and France. (4) If England and France take hostile action as a result of aggression by a European country, and Articles 2 and 3 of this treaty do not apply, the contracting parties may consult and Turkey must at least maintain benevolent neutrality towards England and France. (5) If a European country whose assistance is guaranteed by any of the contracting parties is invaded, or if the security of any contracting party is indirectly threatened by aggression, the contracting parties must consult to adopt a common course of action. (6) This treaty is not concluded to confront any particular country. (7) The articles of this treaty are equally binding, creating mutual obligations between England and Turkey, and between France and Turkey. (8) If the contracting parties engage in war as a result of fulfilling this treaty, they must not negotiate peace separately. (9) The treaty is valid for fifteen years. If it is not terminated upon expiration, it will automatically be extended for five years and shall immediately take effect. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London—Amid cheers in the House of Commons last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced the conclusion of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty. Opposition Labour Party leader Attlee and Liberal Party leader Hore-Belisha rose to congratulate the government. Chamberlain said: "Members of the House, you will recall that on May 12th of this year, I stated that the British and Turkish governments had agreed, for the sake of national security, to conclude a long-term agreement of a reciprocal nature. The two governments, while this agreement was pending, announced that they were prepared to cooperate effectively in certain circumstances. Subsequently, it was decided that the long-term agreement should take the form of an Anglo-Franco-Turkish tripartite treaty. Although the negotiations that continued after May 12th were protracted, there were never any significant differences of opinion and they were conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust. The articles of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty were finalized three weeks ago. The Turkish government hoped that its foreign minister's visit to Moscow might result in Turkey and the Soviet Union concluding a similar treaty, and the British and French governments agreed to postpone the signing. The negotiations conducted by Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu in Moscow have now been temporarily suspended because certain suggestions made by the Soviet Union are incompatible with the points already agreed upon by England, France, and Turkey. However, both the Soviet Union and Turkey have announced that Turkey's relations with the Soviet Union remain friendly. At the same time, the Turkish government decided not to further delay the signing of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this treaty is valid for at least fifteen years. It is therefore not a temporary measure to deal with an emergency, but an affirmation of the three governments' commitment to a long-term policy of cooperation. The long-running negotiations have now been successfully concluded, and we have established a close and amicable relationship with a nation whose people we greatly admire. I believe the House will be delighted to hear this." Labour Party leader Attlee then spoke, expressing his welcome and hoping that the agreement would last and that Anglo-Turkish friendship would become even stronger. Liberal Party leader Hore-Belisha also rose to speak, saying that the successful conclusion of the difficult negotiations was due to the able guidance of Foreign Secretary Halifax and members of the government, and that this was a great victory. Since the end of the European War, Turkey has made remarkable progress in art, culture, and economic development, which is admirable. Now, Turkey and Britain are fighting together for legal order and international events, which is truly satisfying. All members of parliament cheered. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Representatives of Three Countries Congratulate Each Other on Restoring Justice</h3>
<p>Istanbul—When the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement was signed in the Turkish capital, no ceremony was held. The British signatory was the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, and the Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Near East, Lieutenant-General Wavell. The French representatives were the French Ambassador to Turkey, René Massigli, and the former Chief of the General Staff, General Weygand. The Turkish representatives were Prime Minister Saydam and Chief of the General Staff General Kâzım Orbay. After the signing, the representatives of the three parties each drank champagne to congratulate each other and solemnly declared that the purpose of this new agreement was to restore justice and lasting peace in Europe. The Turkish side believes that this agreement signifies that the three countries will cooperate to protect all small countries from the expansion of certain powerful countries, especially in the Balkans and the Near East. At the same time, all Turkish newspapers solemnly stated that although the talks between the Soviet Union and Turkey in Moscow have broken down, the twenty-year friendship between the two countries has not been affected. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Italy Also Welcomes It</h3>
<p>Rome—In the new situation created by the Anglo-Franco-Turkish treaty, two factors are welcomed here. One is Turkey's refusal to change the current status of the Dardanelles Strait to benefit the Soviet Union. Italy is particularly unwilling to see the Soviet navy become a factor in the Mediterranean. The other is Turkey's continued guarantee to Romania. Italy believes this is a sign that Turkey is paying attention to resolving the Balkan issues and organizing a Balkan peace group. Fascist figures believe that the conclusion of this treaty is a natural result of the suspension of the Soviet-Turkish talks. The Turkish Foreign Minister had already indicated his independence in relations with the Soviet Union during the Moscow talks. According to opinions here, the situation before the conclusion of the Soviet-German agreement has now been restored. Although this may not have a direct impact on the war, it seems to have a significant impact on future developments that cannot be predicted. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>German Officials Frustrated and Disappointed</h3>
<p>Berlin—After the signing of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty, German officials were both frustrated and disappointed, as can be seen in the comments in various morning newspapers. The Essen National Daily (the mouthpiece of Aviation Minister General Göring) published an article a few days ago strongly stating, "It is time for Turkey to decide its attitude." Now, it has to admit in a pessimistic tone that Turkey has already made its choice, but the direction it has taken is not what Germany had expected, and even claims that Turkey has become a mercenary of Britain. On the other hand, the general public here is extremely concerned about the failure of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. They believe that the Soviet Union has always upheld the German viewpoint and taken its interests into consideration. It is also said that the aim of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty is clearly to resist Germany's expansion in Southeast Europe. It is noteworthy that the Soviet Union was not shocked after the publication of the treaty. The fact that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has repeatedly held talks with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax recently is also highly suspicious to the general public here. In short, general public opinion believes that Germany has once again been deceived by the Soviet Union. However, German officials say, "Turkey has made the same mistake as Poland," to threaten Turkey. (Agence Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin—Regarding the signing of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty, the official authorities here have not yet issued any comments. Political figures said that it is aimed at the Soviet Union and Italy, and that Germany will issue comments only after the Soviet Union and Italy have expressed their reactions. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Call It an Anglo-French Victory</h3>
<p>New York—The New York Times reported that the Allied countries have gained substantial benefits from the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement. This agreement is the first real victory for the Allied side since the outbreak of the war. The Allied countries, having experienced repeated disappointments and setbacks, are especially welcoming this agreement. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>British and French Near East Military Commanders Meet with Turkish Military Authorities; Turkish Foreign Minister Sends Telegram to the Soviet Union to Maintain Bilateral Relations</h3>
<p>Constantinople, Turkey—The Commander-in-Chief of French Forces in the Near East, the former Chief of the Army General Staff General Weygand, and the Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Near East General Wavell, jointly visited the Turkish Minister of Defense General Tımaz and Chief of the General Staff General Çakmak this morning to conduct military talks. The content has not been released. The talks will continue tomorrow. Prime Minister Saydam will host a banquet tomorrow evening to entertain the representatives of England and France. (Agence Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Moscow—Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu yesterday sent a telegram to Soviet People's Commissar and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Molotov, expressing his deep gratitude for the warm hospitality he received in Moscow. The concern of your country for the Turkish people has further convinced me of the amity and mutual trust between the two countries. This is an indelible impression I gained from the talks with senior Soviet officials. I hereby request your Excellency to accept my assurance of the unchanging friendship between the two countries and to convey my gratitude to the Soviet government. Molotov replied immediately, saying that he was deeply grateful for the warm feelings and kindness expressed by His Excellency. The exchange of views has reaffirmed the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and he is also extremely pleased about this. He hereby requests His Excellency to accept his assurance of friendly feelings. (TASS, 20th)</p>

<h3>Southeast Scotland: Three Air Raid Alerts; Enemy Planes Reconnoitered Without Dropping Bombs; Western Front Still Quiet</h3>
<p>London—Scotland was raided by German planes this morning. Air raid alerts were issued in eastern and southern Scotland, and the sound of anti-aircraft guns was heard. The alert was lifted half an hour later, but the British anti-aircraft gunfire did not stop. Half an hour after the first alert was lifted, a second alert was issued, which was lifted after ten minutes. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London—It is reported that several German planes flew towards the Firth of Forth in Scotland this morning. The cities of southeastern Scotland immediately issued three air raid alerts. Hearing the sound of enemy planes flying north, the anti-aircraft batteries in Edinburgh immediately opened fire. Several fighter planes also took off to search. The alerts were lifted around noon. In addition, enemy planes were heard flying over the Firth of Forth. (Agence Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris—The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 92, stating, "Last night it rained. Apart from the activity of both sides' scouts, the front was quiet." (Agence Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris—The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 92 in the evening, which, in addition to reporting the situation, also recalled the German attacks on the 16th of this month, stating, "Yesterday, both sides' reconnaissance units patrolled repeatedly east of the Moselle River. Our artillery was very active there. As for the fighting on the 16th of this month, the German army launched attacks in two directions on that day. One was on a six-kilometer front east of the Moselle River, and the other was on a thirty-kilometer front east of the Saar River. However, our divisions, which had reached that area in September, had already been ordered to withdraw the main force to the rear when the enemy began bombardment in preparation for the attack. Only a small number of infantry and cavalry units were left on each front. Therefore, both enemy attacks failed. The small number of cavalry units at that time also retreated to the pre-arranged defense lines according to the plan. The losses were minimal, with only one enemy officer and about fifty soldiers captured by us. However, they resisted bravely and did not yield until death. In short, our army has already deployed a new front line according to the plan, and we have captured many enemy soldiers in most places." (Agence Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris—British Aviation Minister Sir Kingsley Wood arrived here yesterday to hold talks with Aviation Minister Laurent-Eynac. Full understanding has been reached on various issues concerning the mutual cooperation between the British and French air forces. (Agence Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin—The German High Command declared that after the end of the fighting in the Saarbrücken southeast war zone, the Western Front has become quiet, with only minor artillery battles and reconnaissance activities. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris—Fifty French soldiers were surrounded by a German reconnaissance unit in the front lines yesterday. After fierce resistance, it is reported that they were captured by the enemy. Semi-official sources here recently stated that this did not happen when our outpost troops were withdrawing, but when the two sides' positions were re-established and the outpost troops made contact again. Apart from this, the entire line was very quiet. As for the number of French soldiers captured by the German army, the number they claim is actually far greater than the total losses of the French army, which has been denied by our military authorities. Even in terms of the number of French planes shot down they have claimed, it is also greatly exaggerated. They have reduced the number of enemy planes shot down by us, claiming that they have only lost eleven planes on the Western Front. However, according to the announcement of our General Headquarters, there were as many as twenty-four enemy planes shot down within our military positions in the first half of September alone, not counting those shot down within enemy positions. (Agence Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Preparedness Far Superior to the Past; Naval Power Can Control the North Sea; Confidence in Victory</h3>
<p>London—According to experienced observers here, Britain's preparedness today is far superior to that of 1914. Britain has been accumulating military supplies, reorganizing its army, and implementing conscription for a year, and unlike the last war, it does not have to divide its forces to Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Dardanelles. Now, it can use its full naval power to prevent supplies to Germany, and can deploy millions of troops on the Western Front, which are placed under unified command from the beginning. Germany, on the other hand, has insufficient food and supplies for its people at the beginning of the war, and its morale is low. Its supplies are only sufficient for short-term needs, and its hopes of relying on Soviet supplies are dim. Although several countries continue to trade with Germany, Germany has limited gold reserves and cannot afford to pay for the goods purchased from these countries. In view of Britain's determination, all neutral countries now recognize Britain's right to suppress German supplies. Germany's only hope is to win the war quickly, but it is blocked by the heavily fortified Maginot Line and has little chance of success. Although Britain has suffered some losses, it still controls the North Sea, because Britain has many ships and it is easy to make up for the losses. Germany claims to control the North Sea and calls it the "German coast," but there is not a single German merchant ship in the North Sea today. German ships cannot enter the North Sea, nor can they break through the network of British warships and aircraft. British ships, on the other hand, are constantly traveling back and forth in the North Sea. The German fleet has not attempted to break through this steel network, and the German air force's attacks on British ships have only resulted in costly failures. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Turkey's New Railway Holds Inauguration Ceremony; Strategically Important</h3>
<p>Istanbul—Turkey's new railway from Sivas to Erzurum held an inauguration ceremony today. Many Turkish government ministers attended the grand ceremony. The railway extends to the Soviet-Turkish border in the Caucasus region and is not only economically important but also strategically important. During the last World War, Turkey's war against Russia was severely affected due to the lack of this railway. The railway is connected to the narrow-gauge railway that was built before the war to the Turkish border fortress of Kars. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Returns from the Soviet Union</h3>

Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Terentiev also returned to his post. When the Foreign Minister landed, the crowd gathered at the pier to welcome him, and a company of soldiers lined up to salute. In addition, Romanian Ambassador to Turkey Stoijka arrived here today from the Turkish capital, and after meeting with Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu in the evening, returned to his country to report on his duties.

Also, when the Red Army arrived at the Riga highway, representatives of the Estonian army commander-in-chief greeted them. The Soviet and Estonian motorcades saluted each other, and both sides sang the International and the Estonian national anthem. The Soviet infantry, artillery, and tank units maintained excellent discipline. Before arriving in Estonia, a certain tank unit of the Red Army had completed a difficult journey of six hundred kilometers. (TASS, 19th)</p>

<h3>Joint Declaration Issued After Nordic Four Nations Conference; Demands That All Countries Respect Their Neutrality; Unwilling To Take The Initiative In Mediating The European Situation</h3>
<p>Stockholm—After the conclusion of the conference of the heads of state of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, a joint official report was issued, the main points of which were to declare the absolute neutrality of the Nordic four countries in the current European war, and to indicate that the Scandinavian countries are prepared to participate in the mediation efforts to restore peace in Europe at any time. The original text is as follows: "1. From October 18 to 19, 1939, the Kings of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, the President of Finland, and the Foreign Ministers of the four countries held a meeting in the capital of Sweden to discuss general attitudes and individual issues of each country. First, it was declared the complete and free determination to maintain a neutral position, and requested that other countries respect it. Secondly, the four countries decided to follow the policy of the joint declaration issued by Norway, Sweden, and Denmark between 1914 and 1918. Regarding the current war, regardless of its time and scale, the Nordic four countries must maintain friendly and trusting relations. Thirdly, various difficulties in commerce and shipping caused by various measures of the belligerent countries were discussed, and it was decided to cooperate with each other for joint protection, to promote the relationship of the Oslo Group, and to take steps to protect joint interests with other neutral countries. Fourth, during the meeting, the King of Sweden received many telegrams from neutral countries in the Americas, the contents of which have been published. The Nordic countries attach great importance to them. Finally, before the outbreak of war in Europe, the Nordic countries sent a telegram to King Leopold of Belgium, expressing their willingness to promote peace. The heart is sincere and unwavering, and the Nordic countries will be very welcoming and supportive if it is possible to reach an understanding between the belligerent countries and establish a peaceful order." (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<p>Stockholm—After the conclusion of the four-nation conference, Finnish President Kallio announced on the radio in the presidential palace here today that the peace-loving Finnish people, while only hoping for peaceful lives in their own country, will unanimously defend their independence. They have always hoped that their strong neighbors will respect the peace treaty signed with Finland, which clearly stipulates that disputes, if any, will be resolved peacefully. Finland abides by its obligations and trusts in God, and believes in the justice of its cause. The Kings of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark who attended the meeting also gave speeches (see yesterday's telegram). (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Stockholm—The "Daily News" recently commented on the results of the Nordic four-nation conference, saying, "The right to national self-determination of the Nordic countries has been reiterated by this conference. It is a good thing that these countries, as expected, did not assume the role of mediator for the current European war, as any attempt to mediate under the current circumstances would be a futile gesture." The "Social Democratic Newspaper" stated, "Unless the belligerent countries accept mediation, neutral countries should not rashly speak of mediation." The "Times" stated, "The front line of the Nordic countries has been strengthened by this conference." In addition, all newspapers have praised the main achievement of this conference, which is that Finland, with the support of other Nordic countries, will maintain neutrality and safeguard its independence with a firm attitude.

<h3>General Xue Yue Talks: Northern Hunan Defense is Strong; People and Army Cooperate Closely; Japan Intends to Resume Offensives to Capture;</h3>
<p>Hunan: According to General Xue Yue, Commander of the Chinese Army in the Ninth War Zone, in a conversation with the Associated Press reporter, the Japanese army may be ready to complete preparations and attack Changsha again after three months. However, after my (the reporter's self-reference) inspection of the 30-mile war zone from Changsha, I firmly believe that if the Japanese army attempts to attack Changsha again, they will inevitably take another route. The area north of Hunan that I passed through is entirely a tea-producing region, rich in romance. Every spring, the young women here mostly use the money earned from picking tea as dowry and seek their ideal husbands during the tea-picking season. At the same time, this area was formerly a trade route. As for now, although it has not been invaded by the Japanese, it has become a no-man's land. Except for a few farmers still engaged in farming, most have moved elsewhere. Although some have returned to the area, they mostly come to retrieve belongings. As for the roads in this area, most have been completely destroyed. Along the way, there are traps thirty feet wide and fifteen feet deep dug to prevent the movement of tanks, artillery vehicles, and heavy artillery. At the same time, old-fashioned handcarts are also inconvenient to travel. Some sections of the road have been completely turned into rice paddies, and ponds are everywhere. Tanks and heavy artillery in them would feel unable to move an inch. As for the slopes of the small hills, machine gun positions are everywhere. In this environment, the Japanese naturally have no way to advance. According to General Xue Yue, the Chinese army employs three tactics in the northern area: (1) Destroy all transportation to render the Japanese mechanized units completely useless, while cutting off the Japanese rear transportation; (2) Relocate all the people in the path of the Japanese army to prevent the Japanese from obtaining guides and from obtaining food; (3) Lure the Japanese army into the mountains and annihilate them. The northern Hunan area has such defensive methods and the people have a very practical cooperation with the army. Therefore, the Chinese side can easily repel the Japanese army's attack. The Chinese military officers here also deeply believe that the Japanese army is likely to launch another offensive. According to General Xue Yue, in this kind of terrain, 90,000 Chinese soldiers armed with rifles, machine guns, and mortars can contain the advance of 180,000 Japanese soldiers. But even if the Japanese army manages to capture Changsha, all they will get is an empty city. Changsha used to have 200,000 people, but now it only has 40,000, and they all have special permits. When ordered to evacuate, they can evacuate immediately. The goods in the shops in the city have also been completely moved. There are also very few boats in the Xiang River; those that exist are hired by refugees because Japanese armed speedboats often attack passing ships. As for the Japanese air raids, they have disappeared in the last three days, which shows the great effect of the recent Chinese aircraft bombing of the Japanese airfield in Hankou. Before the Chinese aircraft bombed the Japanese airfield in Hankou, the areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi were subjected to at least one Japanese air raid every day. The railways and roads from Changsha to Hengyang have been dismantled by the Chinese side, and countless traps for tanks and heavy artillery have been dug. When the reporter arrived in Changsha, he took a shallow-bottomed steamboat that was less than three feet deep, but the bottom of the boat was often rubbed, because there were a large number of mines and barriers laid underwater. At the same time, the Chinese side has extremely strict defenses on both sides of the Xiang River, so if the Japanese want to advance, they must be assisted by infantry. According to General Xue, if the Japanese come again, the Chinese side can still give them a crushing defeat. The three months of war this year have enabled the Chinese side to gain new tactics, and the combat effectiveness of the Chinese army has also greatly increased. We are now using the lessons we have learned in the past: the best defensive battle is an offensive battle. "For example, recently, the Chinese army had a battle line stretching 250 miles from Nanchang to Dongting Lake, and the Chinese army's position was extremely unfavorable, but we were able to attack the weak points of the Japanese army, so we were able to turn danger into safety. It is heard that the Japanese are now gathering reinforcements and sending another five divisions. We welcome them very much and firmly believe that the Japanese will definitely not be able to cope with us in this kind of geographical environment in northern Hunan, because the Chinese in this area are all soldiers with extremely experienced mountain warfare. At the same time, we will take the offensive in the future and will never only take the defensive. We must cut off the Japanese transportation lines, so we firmly believe that if the Japanese try to attack again, we will win another complete victory." (Report from Martin, special correspondent of the Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Children's Nursery Opens; Conference of Directors</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Wartime Children's Nursery Association of the Chinese Women's Association for Comforting and Defending Soldiers in the War of Resistance held its first conference of directors of children's nurseries on the morning of the 20th in 淪. A director of a certain branch gave a speech and reported on the progress, saying that today's Wartime Children's Nursery Association is convening the first conference of directors of children's nurseries. In addition to those present, there are still a few directors who have telegraphed for leave due to difficulties in traveling back and forth. Since its establishment, the Children's Nursery Association has had 16 nurseries, housing about 20,000 children, and a total of more than 1,000 service personnel directly participating in the work. There are even more people indirectly participating in the nursery work. The Ministry of Finance allocates a certain amount of subsidies every month, and the insufficient amount is generously raised by Madam Chiang Kai-shek, who appeals to enthusiastic people at home and abroad for donations, which is admirable. Since the War of Resistance, the number of displaced children has been very large, and the nurseries have only taken in about one-tenth of them. It is hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically support the nursery work, which is of great importance to the future of the country and the nation. How to expand the nursery work in the future is a serious issue. How has the past nursery work been achieved? Is it reasonable for us? Where should we improve? What are the shortcomings? What are the advantages? These should all be important issues in this conference. This can also be reported. Moreover, the nursery movement relies on the leadership and promotion of Madam Chiang Kai-shek to have today's scale, so it is inevitable to express our deep respect to Madam Chiang Kai-shek, etc. It was decided to invite Madam Chiang Kai-shek to give instructions and Yan Fuqing, the director of the Department of Health, gave a speech. Finally, the director's representative gave a reply and the meeting adjourned. (Telegraph from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be Convened Soon</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to the Kuomintang today, speaking to the Associated Press reporter, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang may be convened soon according to a temporary decision. It is heard that what this plenary session wants to discuss is the determination of foreign policy to adapt to the current domestic and international situation, as a guiding principle for the third year of the War of Resistance. The Fifth Plenary Session was held in January of this year, when it passed resolutions such as continuing the War of Resistance, denouncing Wang Jingwei, and concentrating the will of the Kuomintang to support the War of Resistance. The Fourth Plenary Session was convened in Hankou in April of last year, when it passed the close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as the basis for the long-term War of Resistance.

<h3>Two Italian Sailors Arrested by Japanese</h3>
<p>Beiping: On Thursday evening, two Italian sailors were arrested by Japanese military police for fighting with a Japanese person, and have not been released so far. The location of the arrest was in the Luxi Grand Theater (transliteration). According to the Italian side, a Japanese person was rude to a Chinese woman at the time, so he stepped forward to help and punched the Japanese person to the ground. As a result, Japanese soldiers entered the theater, fought with the Italian soldiers, and arrested the two Italian soldiers. (Telegraph from the Associated Press, 20th)</p>

<h3>Swede, Su Dupeng, Regains Freedom</h3>
<p>Beiping: News was received here from Zhangjiakou that the Swede, Su Dupeng, who has lived in Inner Mongolia for a long time, has been released after being detained in the Japanese military headquarters in Zhangjiakou for three months. One of the conditions for Su's release is that he must not leave the Mengjiang area. The matter seems to have been resolved amicably, because it is heard that the Japanese side has asked Su to lead a Japanese exploration team into Inner Mongolia to search for the Nestorian relics he is most familiar with. It is heard that the Japanese military police suspected Su of working for the interests of a certain third country, so they arrested him in Zhangjiakou on June 24. Now it is heard from reliable sources that the relevant third country is probably the United Kingdom, because some of the guests whom Su entertained at his residence, where he has lived for many years, were British personnel from the British Embassy, which aroused the suspicion of the Japanese side. Lieutenant Cooper, a British translator who was arrested for going to Zhangjiakou to investigate the detention of British military officer Colonel Spear, was also among the guests. According to reports, Guihua does not have a hotel, so for many years, foreign merchants traveling to Guihua have stayed at Su's residence in groups. (Telegraph from Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Ordered to Form Cabinet</h3>
<p>Baoging: After King Boris accepted the resignation of the Zagev Cabinet, he is still continuing to discuss the formation of a new government with various politicians. It is heard that the reason for the resignation of the cabinet is that, in the current situation where major issues affecting the Balkans are emerging one after another, there should be a government that fully reflects the national will to maintain its position. The figures in the previous cabinet were almost all of the non-partisan faction, so it is expected that the new cabinet will include some politicians. Former Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov has been ordered to form a new cabinet. (Telegraph from Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Baoging: There is no surprise here regarding the resignation of the Bulgarian cabinet, because Prime Minister Kyoseivanov had already announced that he intended to completely reorganize the cabinet before the opening of the National Assembly on October 28 this year. King Boris will take advantage of this opportunity to hold consultations with national political leaders, and received Moushanov, the Speaker of the House of Representatives yesterday afternoon. Those who will be received today include former Prime Minister Stamboliyski, former Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nikola Moushanov, and members of the Association party, such as Pastukhov. It is expected that the new Bulgarian cabinet will be formed no later than tomorrow. The candidate for prime minister is still Kyoseivanov. In terms of lineup, in view of the seriousness of the international situation, a broad foundation will be adopted to recruit leaders from all factions. (Telegraph from Haitong, 20th)</p>

<h3>Chao-Shan Chinese Army's Commando Attack on Chaozhou City; Annihilated Over a Hundred Japanese and Puppet Troops; Chinese Air Force Destroys Japanese Warehouse</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondent: The Chao-Shan Chinese Army is actively planning to counterattack the Japanese army. Wu Qiwu, Zou Hong, Hua Zhenzhong, etc., convened a conference of county heads and guerrilla leaders in Lantou Baita, Jieyang on the first of this month to redistribute the commando attack force. At 1:00 a.m. on the 3rd, they completed assembly at Fengling on the Anjie Road and divided into two routes to attack Chao'an City. Goto, the commander of the Japanese army in Chao'an, had his morale reduced after being reinforced. In the latter half of September, he made two breakthroughs, both of which were frustrated. He still held the suburbs and strengthened defensive works. On the Chinese side, Zou Hong commanded the security team to attack the northeast gate from Yixi, while the Xiao regiment of Hua Zhenzhong's brigade attacked the southwest gate from Fengxi. Around 2:00 a.m., the fighting had already begun. A part of the security team crossed the river to the foot of Bijia Mountain and surrounded the Han Shan Normal School. They had bypassed the Shangshuimen dike and attacked the Japanese army's position at the east gate. The Japanese army in the city, hearing the sound of guns and cannons coming from the east gate, Han Shan was on fire, and the smoke filled the Xiangzi Bridge, and they rushed back to rescue the east gate. At this time, the Xiao regiment of the Hua Brigade had climbed over the west gate city wall and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army in Dayin Street and Xinqiao City. The guerrillas who had ambushed in the city suddenly responded and blocked the Japanese army from passing through Taiping Road. As a result, a fierce battle broke out in the city. Until 6:00 a.m., more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops were annihilated, and the Chinese army began to disperse and withdraw from the suburbs of the south gate. Around 9:00 a.m., five new Chinese air force planes flew to Chaozhou City from northern Guangdong. At that time, the Japanese army outside the city was preparing to pursue the Chinese army, but stopped when they saw the arrival of the Chinese air force. The Chinese air force reconnaissance lasted for twenty minutes and flew along the coast of Shantou towards Guangzhou. The Japanese army in Chaozhou City then decided to blow the horns again to gather the team. Another team of the new Chinese air force continued to Chaozhou City and dropped more than 20 bombs on the Xiangzi Bridge in the southeast suburbs. The Japanese army's anti-aircraft guns bombarded wildly. The Chinese air force safely flew north. On that day, the Japanese military warehouses at the Spring City Tower Main Station, East Embankment, Hulu Mountain, and Zhugao Mountain in the South Gate were all hit by bombs. The Spring City Tower, the end point of the dike road, was hit by eight bombs. More than 60 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured, and military treasures were destroyed. It is heard that the five Chinese aircraft that flew to Chaozhou first transferred to Guangzhou City's Bai'etan and Henan Inner Harbor Wharf to drop bombs, destroying eight Japanese warehouses in the Inner Harbor. The Japanese military's ammunition and electric oil stored there were hit and burned fiercely. A Japanese ship in Bai'etan was also hit and sank into the water. More than a dozen transport steamships and cargo boats were bombed and sunk.</p>
<h3>New Grain Enters the Market in Wuxi; Rice Prices Unexpectedly Rise Again</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondent: Xiyi has always been the concentration point of the Suzhou-Changzhou rice market. There are many firms in the Beidang area, but they all rely on large-scale shipments from Anhui, Jiangxi, and Yili counties to Wuxi to prepare for rice merchants from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Qingjin, and other ports to come to Wuxi to explore and handle them, and circulate them through transshipment. The firms in this area get profits in the middle. However, capitalists often take advantage of the low prices of goods, compete to buy them, store them in warehouses, hoard them, and monopolize them for profit, or take advantage of the high prices and shortages of goods in Shanghai to smuggle them in large quantities and sell them at good prices. This year's rice prices started at 12 yuan in the spring and once rose as high as 25 yuan during the summer and autumn, causing the lower classes to complain endlessly. After the rice merchants dredged the source, although the new rice has been on the market recently, it still hovers around 18 yuan. Combined with the measuring instruments of the past, the price of each stone of rice is still above 20 yuan. Examining the reasons for this, recently, rice boats from Anhui, Wuhu, Nanjing, and other places have successively arrived in port. In the four villages of Muxian County, early rice has entered the market and the harvest is still good. There are also people who come to the city to sell rice and exchange it for goods. Boats from Changzhou, Yixing, Jintan, and Liyang counties are gradually coming one after another. Market prices should have fallen back, but recently someone at the rice market tea party has waved to move thousands of bags of Shanghai rice grains. The general firms have calculated that after deducting the shipping cost of six or seven yuan per bag, there is still a profit to be made. Therefore, they all compete to rush to the market to handle the matter in order to install it quickly. For a time, supply could not meet demand. In a few days, each stone rose by two yuan. Indica rice could not avoid being affected. According to this situation, we must wait for the late rice to enter the market in large quantities and for the influx of tourists from all over the world to be strong before there is hope of a decline.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army from Suzhou Opens to Jiaxing; Ambushed Near Shengze; More Than Three Hundred People Were Annihilated; Xu Minzhong has been Killed in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondent: Recently, the Chinese army in the Jiaxing area has been unusually active. The original strength of the Japanese army was very weak, so the Japanese army was transferred from Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places to increase defense. A few days ago, early in the morning, more than 300 Japanese soldiers took three trains along the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway to Jiaxing. The Chinese army heard about this and immediately sent a team to ambush the road corner and buried landmines. When the Japanese army arrived near Shengze, they were ambushed by a landmine. More than 50 Japanese soldiers were turned into powder. The remaining Japanese soldiers were also attacked by the Chinese ambush soldiers. It is heard that they were all annihilated.</p>
<p>After the Chinese army in the suburbs of Hangzhou joined forces with the fresh forces of the Chinese army that arrived from the south bank, its strength has become even more formidable. A week ago, the ×××th Division of the Chinese army destroyed four Japanese military vehicles near Linping Xucun, and more than half of the Japanese soldiers died. Last night, the ×××th Division of the Chinese army attacked the hydropower plant, an important military organ of the Yaokou Army, and a fierce battle broke out. The battle continued until dawn, and the two sides were still fighting, but the hydropower plant there had been burned by the Chinese army. It is also learned that the Chinese army outside the Genshan Gate attacked the Japanese army there late at night a few days ago. The two sides fought fiercely for a day and a night. The Japanese army suffered more than a hundred casualties.</p>
<p>Xu Minzhong, the magistrate of Pinghu County, convened a meeting of Baojia in the Xincang area two weeks ago. Unfortunately, he was captured by the Japanese army and taken to the Pinghu Military Police Team for interrogation, resulting in a damaged body. Later, he was transferred from Pinghu to the Japanese Special Service Agency in Hangzhou. He was repeatedly induced to surrender with benefits, but he refused. It is heard that he was killed outside the Qingbo Gate in Hangzhou on the 19th. It is also learned that Xu could not even walk (because he was injured by torture) when he was escorted to the execution ground, but he was still whipped frequently along the way. Xu did not change his expression at all and shouted slogans loudly, which moved everyone who heard it.</p>

<h3>Golden Gate and Xiamen Daily Nightmares: Japanese Officer Assassinated; Notorious Puppets Flee to Hong Kong and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Xiamen Liaison Department of the Japanese Asia Development Board recently ordered the puppet regime in Xiamen to establish a so-called Fujian Province Peace Promotion Association to promote "peace." The puppet municipal government has already complied and organized its establishment, even holding a propaganda meeting at the Lujiang Theater, which the public was forced to attend, but the number was very small. Furthermore, many officials of the puppet municipal government have recently become aware that the collapse of the Japanese army is imminent, so they are all preparing to escape. Lu Yongchuan, the secretary of the puppet municipal government, Xiao Bingrong, the director of the puppet police bureau, and Jin Fusheng, the director of the puppet finance bureau, have already left Xiamen one after another. Lu claimed to be going to Shantou to contact the puppet organizations there to exchange information, but in reality, he plans to escape to Hong Kong or go abroad. Jin claimed that he wanted to go to Shanghai to bring his family to Xiamen to escape the tiger's mouth. Therefore, the Japanese army has been intensifying its surveillance of the puppets in recent days. Unexpectedly, Tamura Hanjun, an officer of the Japanese Army Ministry, was suddenly assassinated by someone in front of the Taiwan Guild Hall on Minquan Road, Xiamen, at 8:00 AM on September 12, and died on the spot. The order was in chaos at the time. The Japanese army immediately dispatched troops to search, and four speedboats patrolled the docks and prohibited ships from coming and going, cutting off traffic between Xiamen and Gulangyu. It was not until 4:00 PM that traffic was restored. At that time, the Japanese army arrested dozens of innocent Chinese civilians. Tamura's body was cremated by the Japanese Army Special Service Agency stationed in Xiamen on the 16th and transported back to Japan. After the incident, the Japanese army in Xiamen was extremely frightened and imposed martial law day and night, and offered rewards for information. However, one wave subsided, and another rose. The Japanese army installed a cannon on the Dashi Lake Fortress on Heshan Mountain in Xiamen, and fired indiscriminately at Jimei and other places. Dozens of soldiers were stationed there, and they raised the flag every morning. On the evening of September 23, the flag was taken down and many anti-Japanese slogans were found nearby. When the Japanese soldiers saw this situation, they immediately split up and searched everywhere, but found nothing. They then reported the situation to the Naval Command, which ordered all posts to deploy police and keep a close watch. The next day, two Japanese soldiers were found tied up and unable to move at a certain post. The command of the fort interrogated the two Japanese soldiers, but could not get any useful information. The Naval Department was very ashamed and angry, and severely reprimanded them. The Japanese military command therefore became suspicious, saying that the Chinese army along the coast of Xiamen was about to counterattack Xiamen, and there was a general atmosphere of panic in the city. At 10:00 PM, special martial law was imposed, and all key points along the coast were guarded by the Japanese army, without using puppet police. As for the guerrillas on Kinmen Island, they are extremely active, making it difficult for the Japanese and puppets to eat and sleep, and there are often incidents of attacks, assassinations, and poisoning. The Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board recently summoned Wang Tingzhi, the head of the Kinmen puppet maintenance association, to Xiamen and severely reprimanded him, saying that he was weak in ability, inefficient in handling affairs, and did not win the trust of the islanders, which led to the guerrillas lurking on the island. In his words, he was stern and ordered the abolition of the puppet Kinmen Security Maintenance Association and the establishment of a puppet administrative supervisory office, which was under the command of the puppet Xiamen municipal government. The entire island was divided into two districts, the first district was located in Shawei Street, and the second district was located in Houpu, each with a puppet district chief. The original small puppets of the puppet association were mostly laid off. At the same time, the Japanese and Taiwanese people living in Kinmen and Xiamen were evacuated in batches, divided into three steps: (1) The bourgeoisie and strong men, women, and children were transported to Taiwan and Japan from Fujian and Hong Kong respectively. (2) The middle class and merchants are under investigation. (3) The common people and hooligans will be the last batch to leave. A large number of Xiamen and Heshan civilian workers were hired to dig trenches, pile sandbags, and install barbed wire and other obstacles at various key points in Heshan and at the intersections of Dahan Road, Jinbang Road, Chenguang Road, Sailboat Reef, Xiamen Port, and Sh坡尾. Searchlights were installed around the positions, as if facing a major enemy. At the end of September, a street battle was held, and the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. For a time, shouts of killing were heard everywhere. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly all the way from Siming South Road and Haihou Road. In the end, the Chinese army became more and more numerous, and fought more and more bravely, fiercely pressing towards the Japanese army's positions. The Japanese army was unable to support and released smoke bombs to cover their retreat. Their embarrassing state was laughable. After the retreat order was issued, the Japanese army divided into two groups and fled in search of a way out. One group retreated from Siming South Road to Dashengli and retreated to the Xiamen University at the foot of Fengyao Mountain and boarded ships at the Shanhai Ice Factory pier. The other group retreated along Zhongshan Road through the Water God Temple to Huyu. They were hiding and panicking along the way. It can be seen that the Japanese army in Xiamen is weak and unwilling to fight. However, after this exercise, the Japanese soldiers and puppet police were deeply impressed and were frightened several times a night and could not live in peace. The people of Xiamen Island were secretly happy. Unexpectedly, as soon as the exercise was over, many Blood Soul Group notices and slogans were found everywhere on Gulangyu the next morning. Although the Japanese army searched in every possible way for these notices, it was difficult to find any traces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants in Changzhou Attacked</h3>
<p>Changzhou Dispatch: In the morning before yesterday, near Mishiwan outside the West Gate, two Japanese merchants were selling goods when suddenly a number of Chinese mobile teams came and, suspecting that the Japanese merchants were soldiers, fired several shots, all of which hit vital points. They fell inside the Dingfeng Rice Shop, one person falling at the entrance. The puppet police of Changji Huaide Bridge reported to the West Gate puppet police station. At the same time, the Japanese military police also rushed to the scene. The two injured Japanese merchants were sent to the Japanese military hospital in the city. The area where the incident occurred was searched house by house by the Japanese army, and many nearby merchants and civilians were taken to the Japanese military police headquarters.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Banks Sell Foreign Exchange All Day; It Is Not Easy for Hong Kong Commerce to Operate; Funds Continue to Transfer to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The HSBC listing of foreign exchange has not fluctuated. The black market of British and American exchange rates has shown a steady but slightly firmer trend, but the situation is still stagnant. Prices have no speculative nature. The process yesterday was initially caused by the fact that overseas British and American exchange rates increased by one point, resulting in the morning opening showing signs of tight British and flat American exchange rates. Subsequently, Hong Kong banks aggressively plugged in, and exporters also sold off one after another. HSBC absorbed as many as possible, but the American exchange rate had risen to 7.75 yuan, but because it was also profitable to buy in, the loose trend was reversed. However, Hong Kong banks continuously threw out all day, reportedly as much as 200,000 pounds (equivalent to over 10 million National Currency), resulting in a flat British exchange rate and a slightly looser American exchange rate. It is reported that Chinese merchants and Hong Kong banks have sold off a large number of chips in recent days due to the extreme stability of the legal currency, the tightening of the European situation, and the various commercial shackles of the war in Hong Kong, making it difficult for funds to operate. Therefore, there is a natural trend for funds to transfer to Shanghai. The potential of futures was originally the same as the spot market, but there was little trading. Apart from Hong Kong banks, there were few transactions throughout the day.</p>
<p>Profits Still Being Absorbed</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's big deals reduced the near term by 1.25 and the far term by 3.75. New York silver prices fell by 0.25. London raw gold remained stagnant. The exchange rate of British against Shanghai, France, and other currencies was flat. American against British increased by one point, against Shanghai was unchanged, and against France increased by 1.125. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold 4 pence 9375 and American exchange 7.6875 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the British slightly tightened by 0.015625 and the American was unchanged, which was due to the increase in the exchange rate. After the opening, Hong Kong sent telegrams to sell off, and exporters also sold off, so the trend was slightly looser. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegrams and exporters sold 625 gold to HSBC spot. At the same time, the spot price of American exchange also rose to 7.75 yuan, but there were few transactions. HSBC's listed prices did not move, and the silver balance tax was reduced by 0.01. After that, there were fewer buyers and sellers discussing transactions, so the market was quite calm for a while. Until after 10:30, profits suddenly came to absorb, the same industry spot British gold 4 pence 625, and the spot American exchange 7.71875 yuan. The situation seemed to be slightly more stable. Extending to the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold 4 pence 609375 and American exchange 7.71875 yuan, compared to the morning opening, the British returned looser by 0.015625 and the American slightly lower by 0.03125.</p>
<p>The state of the market is becoming quieter, and the price is hardly worthy of honor or disgrace. However, Hong Kong telegrams continued to plug in 625 British gold to HSBC spot, and there was no trading in American exchange. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold 4 pence 609375 and American exchange 7.71875 yuan (most of them may be difficult to buy at the above price). This month's price is the same as the above price. November British gold 4 pence 546875 and American exchange 7.59375 yuan. The result is that the current British average is flat compared to the previous day, and the American is looser by 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British Exchange Rate Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 20th telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The current British exchange rate is unchanged. The spot American exchange rate is looser by 0.0625, at 25.0625 yuan. The forward rate was not issued. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by one yuan, to 322 yuan. The spot Japanese exchange rate was slightly looser by 0.25, to 106.75 yuan. The market was stable throughout the day, and the market was also without honor.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rate Continues to Loosen</p>
<p>Tianjin, 20th telegram: The exchange market opened this morning and continued to loosen. The spot British exchange rate was looser by 0.0625, at 4 pence 125. The spot American exchange rate was looser by 125, at 6.9375 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate continued to fall by 2.75 yuan, to 110.05 yuan. The "Joint Note" black market was unchanged, still at 86 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Market Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market's sluggish and listless situation showed no sign of change. The small price fluctuations and the lack of interest among operators were already discussed repeatedly in previous reports, so I will not elaborate further. Throughout the day, the market remained weak. Initially, gold firms aggressively pushed down prices, with rumors of a transaction at 1,000 yuan, a drop of nine yuan from the previous day. However, limited-price buyers hesitated to accumulate, and the Hong Kong syndicate's counter-pull managed to raise the price by eight yuan. Subsequently, due to the strength of foreign exchange rates, gold firms sold again. Eventually, relying on currency exchange businesses stepping in on behalf of clients to buy at opportune moments, the downward momentum was prevented from expanding. After a period of fluctuating, the market closed at 1,005 yuan, a drop of one yuan from the previous day. Trading was quiet, with a total volume of over 600 taels. Gold jewelry prices remained fixed, and customs gold prices remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Only Drops Four Yuan</p>
<p>The opening price for spot gold (ten taels) was slightly firm due to the strength of foreign markets, but the overall situation was weak. A certain gold firm initially offered a price of 4,000 yuan to securities firms for ten taels, a decrease of nine yuan from the previous close. Shortly after, the Hong Kong syndicate initiated purchases, and buying interest suddenly increased, causing the situation to stabilize. A certain jewelry store aggressively bought about 200 taels on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate, pushing the price up by eight yuan. These purchases were supplied by currency exchange businesses, gold firms, and other related businesses. Subsequently, as the Hong Kong syndicate stopped buying and observed, the market weakened again, dropping another six yuan. Currency exchange businesses sold 30 taels to securities firms for 4,002 yuan. Later, a certain currency exchange business suddenly pulled up the price, rebounding by five yuan. Currency exchange businesses bought taels from a certain jewelry store for 4,007 yuan. At noon, the situation slightly weakened again. Currency exchange businesses conducted 20 taels of transactions, with a bid price of 1,005 yuan, as the midday closing price. Trading became even scarcer in the afternoon, and the trend was extremely calm. Initially, a gold firm bought 10 taels from a currency exchange business, with the price remaining at 4,005 yuan. Subsequently, a securities firm received dozens of taels from currency exchange businesses for 4,006 yuan and 4,007 yuan. Afterward, another securities firm and a gold firm successively sold 20 taels to currency exchange businesses for 4,005 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, the overall price dropped by four yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day saw only an eight-yuan fluctuation. The selling price of physical gold by cash gold firms was ten yuan higher than the spot gold price, while the purchase price was about thirty yuan lower. The actual gold price was over fifty yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Remain Fixed</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael remained unchanged, as the spot gold trend became increasingly sluggish. Da Tong Heng maintained the original price of 405 yuan per tael, with Xin Tong Heng offering the same price. The purchase price was about fifteen yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Securities Market Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>The trading of unified public bonds yesterday was very quiet because various parties are in a wait-and-see position. The price continued to hover without significant fluctuations, coupled with a lack of news. Major investors were reluctant to act, and short-term traders were even less inclined to take risks, resulting in a sluggish market. During the morning session, Lianyi and retail investors actively bought at the opening, causing the price to rise by two or three jiao. Afterward, Hengfu, Datong, Tongji, Yongda, and other firms suddenly began selling, and the buying momentum weakened, causing the price to fall again. The fluctuations narrowed further in the afternoon, and trading was extremely scarce. Only No. 49 and retail investors showed some interest in buying, while only No. 42 and Xingyuan sold slightly more. As a result, the market price uniformly increased by five fen to two jiao, except for 96, which decreased by five fen. The transaction volume was over 440,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Stocks: 60 shares of Wuzhou Pharmacy stock were traded at a price of 49 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market at the Public Industry Exchange yesterday showed a hidden upward trend, but it lacked the strength to break through the high price of the previous night. The prices of many stocks were strongly supported during slight dips. As a result, the transaction volume slightly decreased. Qinghe Yarn Factory, International Trust Company, Yangzi Silver Company, and Telephone Company stocks were the outstanding performers in yesterday's market. Rubber stocks also experienced good demand.</p>
<p>London, 19th - Reuters: Today's listed prices of British Far East companies were generally calm. However, Kulakk Rubber shares fell by eight pence, remaining at fifteen shillings and seven pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 19th - Reuters: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. Prices for all types of bonds remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Quick Rise, Quick Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market experienced a price drop due to negative foreign news. According to a Dutch telegram, granulated sugar had fallen to 11.33 Dutch guilders. The price of Taikoo B Mark, which was quoted at 14 yuan by the factory the day before, was merely a shouted price. Yesterday, there was an actual price of 16.20 Hong Kong dollars for 2,000 bags. Therefore, the association determined that the recent price increase was excessive, and a correction was underway. The spot price was initially 58 yuan, then 58.5 yuan, and finally 58.8 yuan. Imported sugar fell by 4.5 yuan to 46 yuan. Taikoo Granulated B fell by 2.5 to 3.5 yuan to 62.5 to 61.5 yuan. CW Mark was 61 yuan, XC Mark was 60.5 yuan, DY Mark was 59 yuan, HX Mark was 58.5 yuan, H Mark Grade A was 43.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan. Dutch Grade A was 44.5 yuan, down 1 yuan. Benmian White Zhenji No. 1 was 58.5 yuan, and No. 1 Ice was 70 yuan. Ming Ice was 71.5 yuan, all down 4 yuan. Subsequently, the market weakened again. Gao Huanggang Qing offered 345 bags at a delivery price of 36 yuan, which was lower than before. Yesterday, 500 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton The Bullish Camp in Cotton Yarn Collapses</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend showed no signs of stopping. The situation remained weak because there was still a lack of distinctive sales to customers, and the amount of spot goods in the market felt particularly increased. The foundation of the yarn market became increasingly unstable. As for general trading firms, given the poor actual demand and unfavorable environment, there were very few thoughts of absorbing and increasing their positions. Therefore, Shuangma Brand was taken as the standard. In the past, the bullish forces were particularly strong, so the price increases were unusually large. Recently, this had changed, and the downward trend was particularly strong. In the past, 20-count Tiannv yarn from the same factory had risen by over 100 yuan, but now it was declining daily. This shows that the bullish camp had collapsed. However, raw cotton was still relatively stable.</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning was disorganized, and few people attended. The market only opened at 10:00 a.m., with a drop of 10 yuan. The price of Shuangma was 680 yuan. Shortly after, selling increased significantly, but sales to customers remained stagnant. The price then fell to 665 yuan. However, speculative buying then resurfaced, causing the price to rebound slightly. By the time of closing, the market was still mediocre. The turnover for half a day was 1,295 bales. The prices of 20-count Shuangma fell by 17 yuan, Tiannv by 15 yuan, and Shuangdiqiu by 12 yuan. The amount of spot yarn purchased by various customer groups is listed below: Fellow Traders: 970 bales, Hong Kong: 35 bales, Inland: 100 bales, Total: 1,295 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Dull</h3>
<p>There was no new development in the cotton market, and the market conditions were abnormally quiet. Because the yarn market was declining rapidly, with new lows being discovered step by step, factories were using their existing cotton inventory and had no intention of replenishing raw materials. Therefore, business was very slow. However, Qingdao continued to purchase 32-count raw materials, but the amount was very small. Supply from northern Jiangsu was still maintained. 1,500 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, and 680 bales of northern beach cotton arrived. Today, 540 bales of export cotton were shipped to Hong Kong, with a price reduction of 2 yuan. The sales situation of spot cotton is listed below:</p>
<p>Brazilian Special Grade: 186.00-190.50 yuan, 500 bales to fellow traders</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton: 134.00-134.50 yuan, another 400 bales</p>
<p>Another report stated that due to the weakness and sluggishness of yarn prices, factories were calculating the cost based on the current selling price of raw cotton, and each bale would result in a loss of 40-50 yuan. Therefore, the purchase of raw cotton was suspended. The goods in the hands of fellow traders were all high-priced goods from before, so they were temporarily unwilling to sell them. Therefore, trading had been very quiet recently. Only the Qingdao syndicate found the selling price of high-grade Brazilian cotton to be still satisfactory, so they purchased 350 bales yesterday at a price of 186 yuan, which was very cheap.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market opened mixed and appeared weak. Fellow traders were still active, but they were affected by a drop of three to four points in overseas merchants. Later, due to the European situation favoring the bulls and purchases by southern groups in the market, prices soared. As a result, the closing prices increased by seven to eight points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market failed to rally, and yesterday it fell by more than two rupees, including forecasts. Egyptian cotton fell by three to five points. Liverpool rose by three pence.</p>
<h3>Grains Rice Falls and Rises Again</h3>
<p>Since the mid-day market for Du Jing rice turned strong yesterday, today started with a surge in arrivals, with over 5,000 bags transported by wagons. This caused a sudden sense of uncertainty, and local merchants were also watching, making it difficult for the market to gain a foothold. It turned downwards, declining all the way. Seeing the weakness, buyers felt discouraged and collectively rushed to sell to avoid losses. As a result, the downward trend intensified. New Jing and Mi Zhong Baige suddenly rose by more than one yuan yesterday, causing an uproar. However, at this price, sales were sluggish, and the reaction was strong. The closing price for new Jing was a huge decrease of 2-3 yuan compared to before, while Yao Zhong Baige fell by about 2 yuan. Bosheng and Chen Xin fell by slightly less, around 1 yuan. Yanglu Jian followed the decline of Jing, falling by 1.5 yuan. Sales of Kejian were slower than Jing in the early market, so it fell by 1 yuan right from the start, declining all the way. Until mid-market, there were even fewer inquiries, and prices fell by half a yuan. Until the market close around noon, local merchants and inland groups suddenly stepped in to buy at low prices, causing a dramatic reversal of the situation, and the market became active again. Therefore, the closing prices were: 12 yuan, up to 30 yuan, Zhong Jue 27-28 yuan, New Jing 29 yuan, Jue to 25.5 yuan, Su Tong Kun Po 26-27 yuan, New Jing 28 yuan to 26 yuan, Qingjiao Yaozhong 30 yuan to 29 yuan, Fengjing Baige 28 yuan, Jue to 26 yuan, Special Yangjian 22.5 yuan, Jue to 20 yuan, Lujian Special 23 yuan, Jue to 21 yuan, Chenbian Yun 31.5 yuan to 31 yuan, Xin Yuan 25-26 yuan, Jiangbei Jian Special 19 yuan, 18.5 yuan, Nanjing No. 1 Jian 19 yuan 45 jiao, No. 2 19-19 yuan, 18.8 jiao, Zhong 18.5 yuan, Sub 18 yuan to 17.5 yuan. The total turnover was over 7,000 bags.</p>
<p>Ke Xian had already shown signs of decline the previous day. Yesterday, because Japanese merchants continued to dump 3,000 bags in total, confidence weakened further. Also, the confiscated rice was completely released, and since the released rice had no unexpected expenses, the damaged rice was sold at a discount in the market, further impacting the Ke Xian market. Prices fell sharply again, by another 1-1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. High Ke Xian was only 19.5 yuan, and Jueji Xian was around 18 yuan. Although the price changes were small, confidence remained weak. However, Chinese merchants transporting goods in Jiangbei and other ports had all stopped because a certain party was deliberately manipulating food prices, wanting to make a fortune off the public.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales to Customers Still Active Wheat Prices High, Supply Scarce</h3>
<p>Sales of flour to customers in places such as Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Xiamen continued steadily. However, factories were very firm on their selling prices, and warehouse receipts in the market were already scarce. Therefore, only a small amount was being processed, creating a stalemate in the market. The factory price for No. 2 flour was temporarily unchanged, but the price for goods in transit was 7.1 yuan, still higher than the factory price by a few jiao. It was heard that the recent price of the Phoenix brand from Old Mill was around 6.9 yuan, while the future price was 7.3 yuan. The total turnover for all types of flour was 30,000 bags. Today, 2,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The supply of wheat had increased slightly compared to before. However, due to transportation difficulties and high costs, suppliers planned to store the wheat in warehouses and wait for higher prices. Therefore, the amount of wheat circulating in the market was low. However, factories were unwilling to lower prices and buy because current flour prices were difficult to raise. Therefore, the market also tended to become stagnant. As a result, only storage firms purchased two carts of Wuyi and Changzhou wheat, with prices ranging from 10.05 yuan to 10.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Sesame Storage Firms Active Soybeans Remain Stable</h3>
<p>Recently, the supply of sesame seeds had been slightly scarce. Although exports were observing, storage firms and those making pure goods were very eager. As a result, the market price was rising due to the tight control of goods by suppliers. Yesterday, Yangzhou sesame had opened at 28.5 yuan, Guantian sesame at 32 yuan, and Wuhu sesame at 30.7 yuan. The total turnover for all types of sesame was over 1,300 bags. Arrivals and sales of soybeans were equally matched, and the market conditions remained stable. Sales were mainly handled by local traders on this street alone, with only a small amount being exported. Today, 985 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea White Silk Prices Soar by 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>The silk market in this port is experiencing a rising trend. 7-8 silk yesterday sold at an unprecedented price of 4,700 yuan, a sharp increase of 400 yuan compared to 4,300 yuan two days ago. Six firms in Guoli purchased 100 dan each at a price of 2,400 yuan. In the overseas silk market, Yokohama was closed, but the rising trend in New York remained strong. Recent futures prices rose by 1.2 jiao, and long-term futures prices rose by 0.95 jiao. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk rose by 0.05 yuan, and Japanese silk rose by 0.02-0.05 yuan. The future changes in the silk market tend towards a bullish direction. In this port, most silk mills are currently suspending operations, and production is declining daily due to raw material problems. Market sales (including storage) are indeed rising with the rising silk prices. Therefore, silk prices are likely to reach unprecedented heights.</p>
<p>East White Iron Difficult to Surge</p>
<p>East White Iron, which had been stable for a long time, had risen slightly after the prices of various goods soared. However, its rising trend was not very strong. Yesterday, the price had risen from 7 yuan to 7.3 yuan (for 3-7 chi goods) and from 6 yuan to 6.3 yuan (for 3-6 chi goods), an average increase of 0.3 yuan per sheet compared to before. The main sales channel for this good was local construction, and other foreign merchants such as those from Yangzhou, Wenzhou, Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao also purchased 200-300 bundles.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions Summary</h3>
<p>Overseas Silver Prices Continue to Decline: London, 9th - Reuters: The silver market continued to contract. Recent prices contracted by 1.25, and long-term prices contracted by 1.75. There were short covering transactions in the near term, and American merchants sold long-term contracts. Trading was light, and the market was calm. After the close, the market remained stable, with a few transactions at the listed prices. Also, New York: The spot price of American silver contracted by 0.25. Bombay: The spot and near-term prices of Indian silver contracted by 2 annas, and long-term prices contracted by 14 annas. The market was calm, and the transaction volume was 50 contracts.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Exceeds 50 Yuan: The discount rate for bill clearing fluctuated and fell again. The discount rate per 1,000 yuan once fell to a low of 50 yuan. It opened at 55.5 yuan in the morning, then gradually fell to 50 yuan. At noon, it began to rebound to 52.5 yuan. The final price in the afternoon was 53 yuan, a decrease of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight interest rate remained unchanged at 0.17 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Selling Pressure Suddenly Intensifies: Yesterday, the foreign currency market was still not easy to rise. Most people were bearish, and selling pressure was still strong. British gold notes fell again by 0.3 yuan, American gold notes continued to fall by 0.05 yuan, Vietnamese notes also fell by 0.07 yuan, and French franc notes fell by 0.002 yuan. However, Hong Kong notes rose by 0.05 yuan, Japanese gold notes rose by 0.01 yuan, and Korean notes rose sharply, with inter-dealer trades at 1.105 yuan, resulting in a gain of 0.025 yuan. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>Hai Feng Coal Transactions Scarce: Hai Feng white coal fell due to the price cut by Hong Ji at the beginning of the month. Foreign storage firms, seeing the unfavorable situation, sold off their holdings, causing the market to feel oversupplied. However, recently, given the tense European war situation and the uncertainty of future goods, traders had become cautious again and were unwilling to sell easily. Therefore, transactions were rare. The listed price for fellow traders' warehouse receipts was 170-180 yuan, while the retail price for screened lumps was 16 yuan per load.</p>

<h3>Japan's Domestic Situation Already Encounters Unprecedented Difficulties US-Japan Relations Deteriorate Trade Stagnates Legislators Question When the War Will End</h3>
<p>Pieces of Yang Ge's Talk in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that Yang Ge, Far East Manager of International News Agency, residing in Japan, had been in Japan for over ten years. He arrived in Shanghai last Wednesday for a short trip and will return to Japan via North China, Northeast China, and Korea. The reporter interviewed him yesterday (19th). According to him, Japan is currently experiencing a dark period because the country has a severe shortage of raw materials, foreign trade has suffered greatly, the political situation is unstable, and its relations with foreign countries are unfavorable.</p>
<p>Lack of Foreign Exchange Greatest Setback</p>
<p>The collapse of Japan's economic order stems from the fact that the Japanese government sacrificed sound national policies and adopted uneconomical plans for military operations in China. Japan has deeply felt or will soon feel the shortage of many items, including coal, electricity, and water. However, the most serious setback hindering Japan's economic system is the lack of foreign exchange, which prevents it from purchasing imported goods from foreign countries.</p>
<p>Soybean Exports to Germany Come to a Halt</p>
<p>The industrial program that Japan is undertaking in the Northeast has been severely hit by Europe. This is because the export of soybeans from the Northeast has been cut off from at least half of its markets due to the European war. Exports have decreased by 4 million tons. These 4 million tons of soybeans were originally intended to be exported to Germany under a commercial agreement signed between "Manchukuo" and Germany. The agreement was scheduled to take effect on October 1st, but it was suspended due to the war. Therefore, the hope of the Northeast obtaining machinery and other necessary imports from Germany has been thwarted and they have been forced to turn to countries such as the United States to obtain the machinery they need. However, neither the Northeast nor Japan can afford this because they have no foreign exchange to pay for the goods.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Nomura Constantly Hindered</p>
<p>American merchants will not sell their products to Japan without cash. The abolition of the 1911 US-Japan commercial agreement was a serious blow to Japan's economic power. Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura is a personal friend of US President Roosevelt. The Japanese people now hope that Nomura can resolve the outstanding issues between the US and Japan. Nomura's work will be greatly hindered by the different views of "certain parties."</p>
<p>The United States Rejects Japanese Goods</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese business community, in view of the recent commercial and diplomatic developments between the United States and Japan, is now worried that the United States will soon refuse to ship any goods to Japan. In the two weeks before he left Japan, it was rumored that the US Treasury Department would soon stop purchasing all of Japan's gold and silver, including those obtained by Japanese in North China. In addition, some American manufacturers have canceled large orders placed by Japanese merchants. Japanese buyers are reluctant to pay cash at increased prices, but American manufacturers still cancel their orders.</p>
<p>Tourism Also Declines</p>
<p>Even Japan's tourism trade is now close to zero because Japanese police authorities impose strict restrictions on tourists visiting Japan. Therefore, there are very few foreigners visiting Japan. He had recently traveled in western Japan and was questioned by five police detectives in less than 200 miles. There are currently 80 detectives in the area engaged in monitoring tourists, and another 70 will soon be added. The reason is that the area is rapidly industrializing and manufacturing military supplies. The Japanese government recently invited 150 American news reporters, magazine writers, and businessmen to visit Japan. When they left Japan, they all expressed dissatisfaction with the inconveniences they had encountered.</p>
<p>Actively Publicizing War Will End Soon</p>
<p>The Japanese government is conducting extensive propaganda work, saying that the war in China has a bright future and constantly reminding people not to forget that the war will end soon and that a "new order" is about to be established. This propaganda work is believed to have given the Japanese people a favorable impression. Although the Japanese government has repeatedly assured that the war will end in the "near future," it is expected that some leaders will soon question the government as to when the war will end. It is now expected that the question will be raised to the government by veteran members of parliament Ozaki and Saito. When Congress reconvenes next January, these two political leaders will express their opinions on government policy. Mr. Yang concluded by saying that he would not be surprised if the current cabinet collapsed and Konoe was brought back to serve as prime minister because only Konoe can now spur on "certain parties." Under Konoe's leadership, Japan may be forced to reach some definite understandings with China and the United States.</p>
<h3>British Troops Armed Patrol Outside the Boundary</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that British troops in a truck patrolled the roads outside the boundary, near where police officers had been assaulted, this morning (20th). The vehicle was equipped with a Bren machine gun manned by a gunner, as well as eight other soldiers armed with rifles. They closely monitored police officers patrolling the roads outside the British zone.</p>
<h3>The Lanchang Labor Strike Negotiation Underway Not at an Impasse</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that senior officials of the British-owned Lanchang Company denied reports yesterday morning (19th) that negotiations to resolve the strikes at the Lanchang factories in Pudong were at an impasse. According to reports, negotiations between representatives of the company and the workers are still ongoing. However, the official did not anticipate what the outcome of the negotiations would be.</p>
<h3>Yu Yuan Road and Yidingpan Road Chinese and Indian Police Ambushed Chinese Policeman Dies Indian Policeman in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Yidingpan Road, the Zujie (Concession) Police Department's Jing'an Temple precinct not only assigned Chinese police to manage the policing of that section but also assigned an Indian policeman to assist. The "Greater Shanghai Municipal Government" also sent four or five pseudo-"police" officers to direct traffic and manage the traffic lights. At around 7:00 PM yesterday, Chinese policeman No. 3378 and Indian policeman No. 459 were on duty when they were suddenly shot and wounded by thugs from the darkness. The Chinese and Indian policemen were very close to the pseudo-"police" officers at the time, but the "police" officers escaped unscathed. At the same time, there were four other pseudo-"police" officers standing guard nearby. Instead of helping to apprehend the assailants, the "police" officers left first. The Jing'an Temple precinct received the report and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to apprehend the assailants, and British troops also dispatched a squad of soldiers to assist, but no clues were found. The wounded Chinese and Indian policemen were rushed to the General Hospital for treatment. However, the Chinese policeman died upon arrival at the hospital because the bullet had entered his abdomen and exited through his back, causing severe injuries. The Indian policeman was shot in the chest, but the bullet did not exit. He is in critical condition and is being treated.</p>
<h3>Displaced Refugees Have Been Resettled Temporarily Residing in Refugee Children's Middle School</h3>
<p>The 31st Refugee Shelter on Jessfield Road was established by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association of Avenue Edward VII. Since the issue of building roads beyond the boundaries arose, the association had been trying to relocate the shelter to prevent further incidents. However, due to the difficulty of finding open space within the boundaries, it was unable to do so for a while. It was then learned that the shelter on Dunsing Road still had room to build sheds, so Mr. Kuai Yanfang negotiated with the association to take them in. Unexpectedly, the pseudo-police impatiently seized the shelter. Fortunately, two new buildings had just been built there this summer as school buildings for refugee children. In this emergency, the association actively handled the evacuation and moved some of the elderly and weak refugees to the school. After the sheds on Dunsing Road are completed, they will be moved there. As of press time, the refugees at the shelter were still being supplied with food as usual, and the order was still good.</p>
<p>Another report stated that according to a report from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department on the 19th of this month, there were 29 refugee shelters inspected by the department within the concession, housing a total of 38,158 refugees.</p>
<h3>Jiading Bank Officially Opens Priority Shares Fully Subscribed</h3>

Chairman of the Board Fan Liangbo first reported the purpose of the meeting and that the 100,000 yuan of 8% priority shares had been fully subscribed by new and old shareholders. Then, the discussion on the scheduled opening of the bank began. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to open on November 14th.</p>
<h3>The United States Still Celebrates Navy Day of Great Significance Does Not Change Traditional Attitude Due to the European War The USS Augusta Will Host American僑民</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the development of the United States Navy, which is now only second in strength to the British, is largely due to former US President Theodore Roosevelt from 1901 to 1904. Therefore, his birthday, October 27th, was designated as US Navy Day. Now, with the Second World War underway in Europe, the American people's celebration of Navy Day this year is of great significance. Although the US Navy authorities have issued new regulations prohibiting the release of information about naval operations and preventing espionage, it is generally believed that the US Navy will still commemorate Navy Day in the traditional way and invite Americans to "board the ship and see your navy." The flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, will be open to American expatriates in this port for tours on the scheduled time of US Navy Day, next Friday, unless Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, issues an order to the contrary.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Master Yuan Ying: Signs Were Present Beforehand; Rumor of Japanese Plans to Organize a Japan-China Buddhist Association; Yuan Ying's Refusal to Serve as Chairman May Be the Reason for His Abduction</h3>
<p>Master Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was suddenly abducted at 0:30 PM the day before yesterday from the Yuanming Lecture Hall at 443 Daxi Road. His whereabouts remain unknown, causing great shock within the Shanghai Buddhist community. The details of this incident are described as follows:</p>
<p>Native of Fujian</p>
<p>Master Yuan Ying was a native of Gutian County, Fujian Province.</p>
<p>He was 62 years old this year. At the age of 19, he became a monk at Yongquan Temple on Shigu Mountain in Fujian. He subsequently served as the chief monk at Jietan Temple, Tiantong Temple, and Qita Temple in Ningbo, Zhejiang. This is why some mistakenly believed he was from Yin County.</p>
<p>Leadership Position</p>
<p>He has long been known in the Buddhist community as a conservative, in contrast to the reformer Master Taixu. However, in the eight years since the establishment of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Master Yuan Ying held the position of Chairman for seven terms, except for the first term when Master Taixu held the position. He held the position of lifelong leader in the Buddhist community, demonstrating his influence among monks and laity. Some say he was a disciple of Master Taixu, but they are completely unaware of the situation in the Buddhist community.</p>
<p>Visited Southeast Asia</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the two Buddhist leaders, the old and the new, parted ways. Taixu went elsewhere, while Yuan Ying went abroad to Singapore to preach. The Kek Lok Si Temple in Singapore was originally a branch of Yongquan Temple on Gushan Mountain in Fujian, and he was currently the chief monk (i.e., abbot) of Yongquan Temple. Therefore, he resided there until he returned to Shanghai in July of this year. He originally planned to return to Singapore after the Mid-Autumn Festival, but the sudden outbreak of the European war delayed his trip, leading to his abduction.</p>
<p>Signs Beforehand</p>
<p>Master Yuan Ying built the Yuanming Lecture Hall at 443 Daxi Road, which served as his residence and place for lecturing. Since returning to Shanghai in July, Yuan Ying had lectured there many times. Recently, after hearing rumors that someone was planning something against him, he removed the plaque outside the lecture hall and stopped lecturing as a precautionary measure, which was quite thorough.</p>
<p>Sudden Abduction</p>
<p>The day before yesterday happened to be the period for the Buddhist Seven ceremony at the lecture hall. Starting in the morning, more than 30 men and women who respected Buddhism gathered there. Yuan Ying then led his disciple, Ming Yang (30 years old, also from Fujian), to the hall. As they were preparing to offer alms and have lunch, seven or eight men in Western suits, armed with pistols (among them, it seemed there were one or two Chinese, the rest were Japanese), suddenly broke in, drove the crowd upstairs, and then took Yuan Ying and his disciple Ming Yang away in a car.</p>
<p>Speculations on the Reason</p>
<p>As of this morning, the Chinese Buddhist Association and the Yuanming Lecture Hall have not yet learned of their whereabouts. However, according to Buddhist figures, before this incident occurred, the Japanese planned to organize a "Japan-China Buddhist Association," with the "headquarters" in Tokyo. Now, in areas that have been occupied, such as Hangzhou, there are "branches." At the time, they were brewing to coerce Yuan Ying to serve as "Chairman," but he was ultimately rejected. Therefore, this abduction is clearly related to this matter.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Reports</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Master Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was arrested yesterday (the 19th) at around 2:30 PM by a group of plainclothes Japanese at the Yuanming Lecture Hall at the corner of Daxi Road and Yidingpan Road and taken to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters at 94 Jessfield Road. He was accused of raising 100,000 yuan in this city during the war to be used by the Chinese government for the war of resistance against Japan. Master Yuan Ying admitted to raising 100,000 yuan and other large sums of money, but insisted that the money was never used for military expenses but to help wounded soldiers. Chinese Buddhist leaders are trying to rescue Master Yuan Ying, but as of last night, he was still being detained by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>British Couple Detained by Puppet Police; Released After More Than Three Hours</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that Mr. and Mrs. Abbott, British employees of Butterfield &amp; Swire, were detained by police of the "Special Municipality" on Wednesday. Yesterday (the 19th), a detailed report was prepared and submitted to the British Consulate. Mr. Abbott was detained for three hours and forty-five minutes, while his wife was detained for a shorter time. The incident occurred on Wednesday when Mr. and Mrs. Abbott were riding horses near Warren Road on Daxi Road.</p>
<p>Frightened by a passing car, Mr. Abbott's horse bumped into a Chinese man on a bicycle, causing a scratch on one of the man's fingers. Three police officers from the "Special Municipality" arrived at the scene, none of whom spoke English. Therefore, Mr. and Mrs. Abbott could not explain to them, but they still tried to tell them that they wanted to return to the roadblock on Daxi Road to find an interpreter.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Abbott eventually went with the three policemen to the British defense zone. A British sentry, realizing the predicament of the two foreigners, notified a Western police officer of the Shanghai Municipal Police, who reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and the British military headquarters. At the same time, several police officers from the "Special Municipality" and a police officer arrived at the scene. Mrs. Abbott attempted</p>
<p>to cross the barricade</p>
<p>and enter the British defense zone, but an officer of the "Special Municipality" grabbed Mrs. Abbott's arm and prevented her from entering. Later, a foreigner intervened, and Mrs. Abbott was able to drag her horse across the barricade and enter the British defense zone. Mr. Abbott was taken to the "Special Municipality Police Station" on Daxi Road for questioning and was not</p>
<p>allowed to return home until 2:45 PM.</p>
<p>Those involved in the negotiations at the time included Chinese, Japanese, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, and the British military. The representative of the British military headquarters was Major General Simmons, commander of the British forces in the Shanghai area, and Lieutenant Commander Henry, the liaison officer with the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Laboratories in Shanghai Must Be Approved; Trademark Bureau's Approval Document Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and other three organizations, previously due to the fact that their member manufacturers were separated from the Central Health Administration in Chongqing by transportation obstacles, resulting in difficulties in submitting various new drugs for testing, and trademark registration was also subject to twists and turns. The associations jointly requested the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve the establishment of temporary health testing laboratories in Shanghai by the associations, etc., to hire experts to preside over the testing affairs. After obtaining qualified proof, they would apply to the Trademark Bureau for registration. Once transportation was restored, they would immediately cancel the laboratories and the Central Health Administration would be responsible. It was learned yesterday that the Trademark Bureau had issued a reply to Shanghai, believing that if the Shanghai Association could submit the proof documents of the Health Administration to the bureau, it could be approved.</p>

<h3>French Consulate General Begins Signing Visas for Goods from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia Detained in Haiphong; Extension Difficult to Approve, Merchants Should Pay Attention; Haiphong Chamber of Commerce Sends Personnel to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, under the order of Chinese Consul Liu in Haiphong, specially sent Wu Bomin and Chen Shanzhi to Shanghai to contact French Consul General Baudic in Shanghai regarding the release of goods from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria detained in Haiphong, requesting that they be accommodated to avoid harming Chinese merchants' capital. The French Consul in Shanghai agreed to accommodate them and agreed on the procedures for handling visa applications. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. After Wu and Chen contacted the French Consul, the French Consul did not approve the request for continued extension of registration and still instructed Shanghai merchants to complete registration as soon as possible by the 31st of this month. Those who do not register after this deadline will be treated as goods from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria and confiscated.</p>
<p>The order has begun for handling visas.</p>
<p>The French Consulate General in Shanghai has approved the request of the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce to handle visas for goods from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria in Haiphong and has already begun to implement it yesterday. All cargo owners who are Chinese merchants are requested to quickly apply to the French Consulate for visa release. The deadline is the end of this month. Those who request a visa must bring proof documents, such as payment receipts and invoices. If visa procedures are not completed after the deadline, the Haiphong authorities will designate them as enemy goods and confiscate them. This matter concerns the costs of Chinese merchants, so please do not ignore it to avoid unexpected losses.</p>
<p>Requesting an extension</p>
<p>According to Wu and Chen, they have come to Shanghai to contact the French side to handle the release of goods detained in Haiphong and have met with French Consul General Baudic several times. However, regarding the request to continue extending the registration deadline for handling visas, the French Consulate has only approved the deadline to be the end of this month. Because the matter is of great concern to the interests of Shanghai Chinese merchants, they have repeatedly proposed it, but have not been able to get to the bottom of it. Therefore, it is not certain that they will be able to extend it again after the end of this month. They plan to return to Haiphong within the next few days to report the results of the negotiations in Shanghai to the authorities for approval.</p>
<p>Merchants' losses are astonishing.</p>
<p>The number of various goods purchased by Shanghai importers from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria is quite large. After the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on September 3, the goods detained by France in Haiphong amounted to no less than 70,000 to 80,000 tons, of which about 60% belonged to Shanghai Chinese merchants. The goods have been hoarded there for nearly two months, and the merchants' economy has been stranded, and their suffering is difficult to express. Now that the authorities have approved the release of the goods, the general importers are overjoyed to hear about it. Therefore, today they are asking about transportation methods in order to ship them as soon as possible for sales and avoid losses. However, the French Consulate has limited the registration to be completed before the end of this month, and those who do not register after the deadline will be confiscated. Therefore, they are still requesting a further extension, but it is difficult to predict whether it will be approved. In short, it is hoped that importers will not be too negligent and go to register as soon as possible to avoid invisible losses. If they are confiscated, the amount of losses will be astonishing.</p>
<p>Dispatching staff to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce has now decided to send four people to Shanghai to liaise with Shanghai importers on everything. Two people are stationed at the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road, and two people are stationed at the Sino-French Express Company at No. 66 Nong 2, Jiangxi Road, and the Sino-South Express Company on Jiujiang Road. In addition, in order to facilitate commercial transportation, the Sino-French Express Company has opened another transportation line. For goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong that are to be transported to Kunming and then transferred to the interior, they can go through Saigon and directly to Kunming. The company has only been operating for three months, and the goods have reached five or six batches, each batch weighing nearly a thousand tons. Since the goods are shipped from Shanghai, they have never taken more than 40 days to arrive in Kunming. It has now signed a joint transportation agreement with Kunming Guohua United Transportation Company for Chongqing and Guiyang. If merchants want to transfer goods to Chongqing and Guiyang, they can directly contact the Shanghai-Hong Kong Sino-French Express Company, which can reach Guiyang in seven days and Chongqing in ten days.</p>

<h3>United Church Committee of America Relief Fund; 2.75 Million Yuan Stored in New York; For Use by American Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that, according to the American Advisory Committee stationed in Shanghai by the United Church Committee in China Relief Committee, despite the war in Europe, the United Church Committee unanimously decided to continue its fundraising campaign to carry out relief work in China and has stored more than 2.75 million yuan in legal currency in New York for the use of the American Advisory Committee, which proves the effectiveness of the United Church Committee's work last year and the assistance of the American church. It was also reported that refugee relief organizations in Shanghai received a telegram from the American branch a few days ago, stating that after the United States expressed neutrality in the outbreak of the European war, it still sympathized with the situation of European Jewish refugees in Shanghai. According to the telegram, approximately 250,000 yuan in Chinese legal currency had been raised in New York, which had already been transferred to the American Red Cross for remittance to Shanghai as a relief fund. The American Fundraising Association in this city held a meeting on the afternoon of the 19th and decided on a total amount of 185,000 yuan. The association, together with the Red Cross European Refugee Relief Association in Woodberry, mobilized fundraising two weeks ago to appeal for the refugees in China.</p>

<h3>Twelve Women's Fashion Stores Resumed Work One After Another; About 20 More Are Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>After the workers of women's fashion and ready-made clothing companies in the Fuzhou Road area went on strike due to the failure of their request for improved treatment, in addition to the 18 companies including Rixin that resumed work on the 18th, Changxing, Hetai, Yongxin, Meizuishi, Yongxiangchun, Shanghai Lao Jiulun, China National Goods Company, Lixingxiang, Xie Feng, and other ten companies also resumed work yesterday after labor and management negotiated on their own and accepted the labor's demands. The minimum wage was 3.5 yuan per piece, and a contract was signed, so more than 100 workers from the ten companies also resumed work yesterday. Xin Guang and Huangjia also accepted the demands, but refused to sign a contract, but the workers have been working as usual. The remaining 20 companies, including Maoli, Meili, Daxin, Meihua, Zhongyang, Yixin, Kangxin, Huahua, Fuxing, Hongshang, Zhengchangxiang, New Life, Da Zhonghua, Huali, Huada, Dahua, Xinxin, Fengxiang, Tianxiang, and Dadong, are still in stalemate.

As a result of the negotiations, the management only agreed to a maximum of 3 yuan, while the labor side insisted on 3.5 yuan to 4.6 yuan, so there was still no result. It was decided to continue negotiations this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Empress Liner Operates As Usual; Japanese Empress Arrives in Shanghai Today; Shirala Enters Port Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Europe, the British Nan Changxing Shipping Company has followed orders from the British military to keep the schedules of its ships strictly secret to avoid accidents en route. After the company implemented secret schedules for its ships, it issued a notice to avoid misunderstandings with the outside world, stating that the Empress liner operates as usual, is well-equipped, and provides attentive service, with Chinese attendants to welcome guests.

<h3>Portuguese Ship "Dadre" Forced to Change Flag; Portuguese Merchants Express Regret</h3>
<p>The Portuguese ship Deyao, represented by the Italian business association Yi Hua Yanghang in this city, was detained by the Japanese Maritime Police on the morning of the 6th of this month. While negotiations were underway, the case was suddenly transferred to the Japanese Navy for handling, and the detention was officially announced. It is now learned that the ship has been moved to the heart of the Yangshupu River the day before yesterday. Although the Portuguese Consul made strong representations, demanding its release, it was unsuccessful. Also, the Portuguese ship Dadre, which was previously detained, has been taken over and cooperated with by the Japanese side and has changed to the Japanese flag. It may be released soon. Portuguese merchants generally expressed regret.</p>
<h3>Aohan Road's Departure and Arrival Stations Shortened; Xiang-Gui Railway Revised Timetable; Xiang-Heng Highway Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Currently, due to the war in northern Hunan, the Yuehan Railway is busy with military transportation, and Zhuzhou Station has been closed and temporarily uses Lukou (only one station away from Zhuzhou) and Qujiang (i.e., Shaozhou) as the departure and arrival stations. At the same time, the highway traffic between Changsha and Hengyang has also been temporarily suspended. The Xiang-Gui Railway, from October 1, changed the 21st and 22nd express trains between Hengyang and Guilin to 11th and 12th special express trains (with sleeping car facilities). They depart from Hengyang at 6:30 PM every day and arrive in Guilin at 7:00 AM the next day. They depart from Guilin at 6:30 PM every day and arrive in Hengyang at 7:05 AM the next day. In addition to the special express train, the 41st and 42nd ordinary express trains still run between Hengyang and Guilin every day, with first, second, and third class passenger cars and dining cars. The journey between Hengyang and Guilin takes 26 hours. There are also regional mixed trains on the Heng-Leng (i.e., Lengshuitan) and Leng-Gui sections, which are convenient for travelers. The ordinary express train ticket prices on the line, from Hengyang to Guilin, are 5.25 yuan in national currency for third class, 10.5 yuan for second class, and 15.75 yuan for first class. The surcharge for special trains is 0.6 yuan per 100 kilometers or less for first class, 0.3 yuan for second class, and 0.15 yuan for third class. The distance from Hengyang to Guilin is 360 kilometers, which can be calculated by mileage. If you take the special express train, the berth ticket prices are 3.5 yuan for the upper berth of first class, 4.5 yuan for the lower berth, 2.5 yuan for the upper berth of second class, 3 yuan for the lower berth, 1 yuan for the upper berth of third class, 1.2 yuan for the middle berth, and 1.5 yuan for the lower berth.</p>
<h3>This City's Land Registers Still Kept by the Shanghai Municipal Council; Puppet Regime's Request for Return is Purely One-Sided Propaganda; Shanghai Municipal Council Continues to Be Responsible and Has Not Considered It</h3>
<p>Regarding the land title deeds and conveyance deeds of this city, after the Nationalist army moved west, because these registers are the foundation of the citizens' property rights and there are a large number of them, the local government sent them to the Shanghai Municipal Council for safekeeping through formal procedures. After more than a year, the Shanghai Municipal Council, having been entrusted in advance, will definitely return them after a proper solution. However, recently, the puppet "Land Bureau" suddenly issued a notice to handle the so-called "Land Reporting" in this city, and on the one hand, it has been claiming that it is negotiating with the Shanghai Municipal Council to return these registers. According to sources familiar with the matter, this attempt by the puppet regime is only a one-sided hope. In fact, the Shanghai Municipal Council has not considered it at all. The applicant for return is not the agency that requested safekeeping at the time, and the Consular Body must have a legal basis for dealing with it. The fact that the Special District Court is still performing its duties as usual is clear evidence of this. Therefore, these rumors are all one-sided propaganda by the puppet regime and will definitely not be realized.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships on the Yangtze River Run in Sections; "Military Tickets" Required to Go to Hankou; Guerrilla Areas Are Affected</h3>
<p>After the Yangtze River route between Shanghai and Hankou was occupied by the Japanese army, there is still no hope for foreign merchant ships to resume sailing. However, the transportation of Japanese ships is very prosperous. The Yangtze River route was previously operated exclusively by the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, but has now been reorganized into the Japanese-owned East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. It is said that the entire Yangtze River line will be divided into sections, such as the Shanghai-Nanjing line, the Shanghai-Wuhu line, the Shanghai-Jiujiang line, and the Shanghai-Hankou line. Chinese passengers can now go to Jiujiang, but those going to Hankou must be approved by the "Military Department" before boarding the ship. Ticket prices are calculated in Japanese currency. It is now learned that the company recently announced that Japanese and Chinese legal tenders are not accepted upstream of Anqing (i.e., all places above Anqing) and that "military tickets" (i.e., military currency) must be used. Chinese legal tender will be rejected. This move by the Japanese shows the financial difficulties of Japan, but the guerrilla areas upstream will be severely affected.</p>
<h3>Super Giant Liners on the Pacific Ocean: U.S. President Lines Company to Solicit Bids for Construction; Tonnage Exceeds That of the Japanese Empress</h3>
<p>A Mainland Press report states that the U.S. President Lines Company will next month solicit bids for the construction of three super-class passenger and cargo liners of 41,000 tons each. According to current plans, these three liners will sail between Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, various ports in Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, and then return to the United States via the original route.</p>
<p>Rumors Have Persisted for Nearly a Year</p>
<p>Since hearing that the United States Maritime Commission planned to build 500 new ships over a period of ten years or more to replace old merchant ships, rumors have been circulating on both sides of the Pacific that the United States is building super-class giant liners, for nearly a year. The construction period for these three liners will last three years, but after they begin operations, the size and speed of all other ships on the Pacific will not be able to match them. Furthermore, the three liners will surpass the 39,000-ton "Japanese Empress" giant liner. The three liners have not yet been named, but each will be 740 feet long, have 65,000 horsepower, a speed of 26 knots per hour, and a capacity of 985 passengers, with exceptionally luxurious facilities.</p>
<p>Six New Liners to Circumnavigate the Globe</p>
<p>However, long before these three liners begin operating, the U.S. President Lines Company will have six smaller liners of 16,190 tons each, with a maximum speed of 16.5 knots and a length of 492 feet, completed for circumnavigating the globe. One of them, named the Sea Arrow, was launched in July and may arrive in Shanghai on its maiden voyage in August next year. It is expected that its five sister ships will begin bi-weekly round-the-world service. The United States Maritime Commission plans to send a total of twenty new liners to operate regularly in the Far East. This plan is not far from realization.</p>
<p>Maritime Commission's Overall Plan</p>
<p>As with the Puchi Sant Dongfang Shipping Company (transliterated) freighter "Kurt Block" arriving in Shanghai on Wednesday, initiating tri-weekly cargo service departing from the West Coast of the United States, sister ships include the "Sata Tia," "Capilillo," and "Colin House." The "Sata Tia" arrived in the Far East three weeks ago but did not call at Shanghai, while the other two liners will regularly serve the Far East following the "Kurt Block." It is reported that cargo space on the "Kurt Block" was pre-booked by American shipping companies several weeks ago, and the 2,000 tons of cargo brought to Shanghai were mostly timber. As for the remaining seven of the twenty liners designated by the Maritime Commission to operate in the Far East, the decision is pending.</p>

<h3>Heinous Parricide Case: Two Sons Sentenced to Death, Their Mother to Two and a Half Years in Prison</h3>
<p>The Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qixiang parricide case in Red Flower Cave, which shocked the nation with its inhumanity, has concluded its trial in the First Special District Court, as detailed in this newspaper. The facts will not be repeated. Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled for sentencing. Men and women concerned about the case flocked to the court to hear the verdict, and before 9:00 AM, Courtroom Two of the First Special Court was packed, with no space left. Defense lawyers Yang Linzhi, Yang Sicheng, Ye Shaoying, and assistant lawyer Jiang Baolian were all present to await the verdict. At 9:30 AM, the presiding judge Fu Lin, accompanied by the court clerk, took his seat, and the court police immediately brought Zhou Qinji, Zhou Qixiang, and Zhou Jing to the court. After Judge Fu asked the three defendants for their names, he stood up and announced</p>
<p>The Judgment</p>
<p>Both defendants are sentenced to death for the murder of a direct blood relative of senior lineage, and are deprived of their civil rights for life. Zhou Jing is sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for aiding in the damaging of the body. One screwdriver, one saw, two wires, one crowbar, one kitchen knife, and one rope are confiscated. The passbook, seal, and 40 yuan in cash are temporarily kept by the assistant police until the heirs of the deceased (Zhou Yongjie) are determined, and then handed over. After the sentence was read, Judge Fu announced the gist of the reasoning for the judgment, stating that although the motive for the murder by defendants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qixiang was to save their mother, the deceased was their</p>
<p>Own Father</p>
<p>Furthermore, the two defendants received a considerable education, and after murdering their father, they heartlessly dismembered his body. Regardless of their motive, their malicious intentions and cruel methods are unforgivable and warrant the most severe punishment. As for Zhou Jing, when her husband was attacked and cried out, she heard the cries but did not investigate. One must know that the cries of a person near death are entirely different from the scolding during ordinary quarrels, and her claim of ignorance is unbelievable. However, according to the defendant's testimony, she did not participate in the pre-planning, and Zhou Qinji and others also testified that the discussion took place in French Park. Therefore, it is difficult to conclusively prove her participation in the aiding of the murder based on the evidence, but</p>
<p>After Her Husband's Death</p>
<p>When the two sons discussed dismembering the body, the discussion took place in Zhou Jing's room, and the keys to the room where Zhou Qinji and others dismembered the body were in her possession. Therefore, she clearly aided in the damaging of the body. The sentence was reduced by one-third in accordance with the law. If the defendants do not accept the sentence, they may appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court within ten days after receiving the judgment. After the announcement, the three defendants were taken down by the police and sent to prison for execution. If the three defendants do not accept the verdict, they will still commission the original defending lawyers to file an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court.</p>
<p>Kidnapping for Ransom</p>
<p>Three Bandits Convicted</p>
<p>Wu Agu's eleven-year-old son, Wu Guorong, residing at No. 5 Niao Qiao Tu, Xinzha Road, Suzhou Wangting, was kidnapped by bandits at noon on August 30 at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Park Road, who demanded a ransom of 5,000 yuan. Later, detective chief Wang Jiaju and Pang Ruiqing of the Lao Zha Police Department apprehended the suspects Xue Kuoming, Zhou Bin, Wu Peng, Wu Shengwu, Mao Apan, and others, and rescued the victim in Pudong. The case was legally prosecuted by police lawyer Ru Bao to the First Special Court, and the trial has concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict: Xue Guanming and Zhou Xin were each sentenced to thirteen years of imprisonment and deprived of their civil rights for ten years. Wu Peng was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for eight years. Wu Shengwu and Mao Apan were found not guilty. Four threatening letters were confiscated.</p>
<p>Hongqiao District Telephone Lines</p>
<p>Stolen Again</p>
<p>Losses Estimated at No Less Than Several Thousand Yuan; Telephone Company Currently Under Repair</p>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily on the 20th, two telephone poles along the Great West Road and Warren Road were cut down yesterday morning (the 19th), and 90 meters of telephone wire were stolen, causing the Shanghai Telephone Company to suffer losses of several thousand yuan. It is reported that the company is currently undertaking repairs, which are expected to be completed by Saturday (i.e., this morning).</p>
<h3>Scenic Southwest</h3>
<p>The Dynamic Appearance of the Southwest is Fully Revealed</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the southwestern provinces have undergone vigorous development and construction under the government's efforts, and various undertakings have been flourishing. The China Travel Service, in order to reveal the full picture of the southwestern provinces and their mountain and river scenery, spent more than half a year collecting scenic photographs and images of various local undertakings from various parts of the southwest, which are compiled into a "Scenic Southwest" painting book, with the aim of presenting the southwestern appearance to readers. The entire book is about 200 pages, with more than 200 copperplate illustrations, printed on high-quality paper. The cover is a color painting, and the appearance and content are outstanding. It can be called the only masterpiece since the Sino-Japanese Incident. Moreover, most of the illustrations in the entire book are provided by the famous photographer Mr. Lang Jingshan. The composition and lighting are excellent, making it even more valuable. It is reported that there are two types of editions, a deluxe edition and a popular edition. The popular edition is sold at a price of four national currency units. It is only retailed at the store in this city. The distributors are the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road and its branches in various districts, as well as the Western painting stores of Bye, Sino-American, Evans, and Dahua.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Appointed but Fails to Appear in Court; Introducer Beaten and Injured; Three Defendants Detained and Granted Bail</h3>
<p>Zhu Deben, a 49-year-old salt merchant residing at No. 103 Qian Hu Jia Zhai in the Xujiahui area of Shanghai, had a son detained by the Public Security Bureau and brought to the First Special Court for trial on a theft charge. Yang Anming (29 years old), a Chongming native residing at No. 62 next door, offered to introduce lawyer Shi Youfu (principal of Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, No. 162 Fuxi Road) to defend him. Yang requested a fee of 220 yuan, which Zhu paid in advance. Yang then gave Zhu a business card of lawyer Shi Youfu. Zhu agreed to pay the remaining 120 yuan after his son's case was concluded. However, during the three court hearings in the First Special Court, no lawyer appeared to defend him, and as a result, he was sentenced to 18 years of imprisonment. Upon hearing the news, Zhu Deben urgently negotiated with the introducer Yang Anming, who was evasive. Zhu then invited Wang Guoquan and Gao Wanyong, who lived with him, to Yang's house to reason with him. They disagreed and fought, resulting in Yang being beaten and injured. The Xujiahui Police Department was notified and sent detectives to arrest Zhu, Wang, and Gao. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the Eighth Court of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi explained the case and filed charges for assault. Since the plaintiff had not arrived, Judge Zhu Chuzhe questioned the defendants and ordered a postponement to the 24th to summon the plaintiff for questioning. The defendants were granted bail pending review.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Inducing Chinese Laborers to Serve in the Military</h3>
<p>Five Hundred People Shipped from Shanghai to Qingdao Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Hua Ji News Agency, the Japanese army, facing a shortage of soldiers, has specially organized the so-called Qingdao Joint Venture Company's Mainland Chinese Labor Company, which specializes in inducing unemployed Chinese laborers from various places to serve in the military. They have successively sent personnel to set up labor recruitment offices in Shanghai, Suzhou, Danyang Town, and other places, specializing in recruiting carpenters and mechanics, offering a daily wage of 2.5 yuan for workers, 4 yuan for foremen, and 1.5 yuan for junior workers, as bait. They also claim to provide food and lodging and advance 10 yuan as a settlement fee, using all possible methods of enticement, so that those who are deceived and enter the trap are countless. Recently, a large number of laborers, about 500, in the Hongkew area have registered in response to the call. It is reported that the purpose of the recruitment is only to repair the bridges and road surfaces destroyed between Qingdao and Jinan. Those who respond do not know the details and are unaware that they are being recruited to serve in the military.</p>
<h3>Sassoon Donates a Large Sum of Money; British Consulate Expresses Gratification; The Funds Will Be Paid in Twelve Monthly Installments</h3>
<p>Sixteen important British groups in Shanghai, in order to contribute to the motherland and support the war effort, established the Shanghai British Central War Fund on the 16th. The establishment of the fund has been officially announced. At the meeting, the renowned tycoon Sir Sassoon emotionally agreed to donate one million yuan, to be paid in twelve monthly installments. The British Consul in Shanghai, Philip, expressed his gratification to reporters regarding Sir Sassoon's donation of a large sum of money.</p>
<h3>Gun Threat Against Silver Company Manager Case: Both Parties Offer Conflicting Accounts; Defendant Files Counterclaim; Court Orders Case Closed Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Zhang Lingyun, a Ningbo native, 23 years old, manager of Yongcheng Silver Company, which lends money at high interest rates, located in Room 241 of the Zhonghui Building, hired lawyer Sun Shian to represent him in a case in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Bi Haomin, a Zhejiang native residing at No. 420 Siming Village, Fuxi Road (owner of Bide Xing Oilskin Shop, No. 35 Luban Road), for</p>
<p>Forcible Coercion and Intimidation with a Firearm</p>
<p>According to the plaintiff, Yongcheng Silver Company requested the court on August 4 to seal up the movable property in the house at No. 130 Magill Road, owned by the debtor Mao Wenlong, as collateral. At 2:00 PM on the same day, the defendant suddenly arrived with Mao Linshu, claiming that the sealed movable property had been transferred by Mao Wenlong to Mao Linshu, and demanded immediate unsealing. They also ordered the plaintiff to go to a lawyer's office to issue blank papers and have the plaintiff sign them and submit them to the court for unsealing.</p>
<p>The Plaintiff Refused</p>
<p>Upon returning to the company, the defendant also followed, using violent and coercive means, taking out his own firearm to threaten and pressure the plaintiff to sign, threatening to kill him if he refused. Li Linshu stopped and dissuaded him. A request was made for a legal investigation. Based on the petition, Judge Wu Kechou held a hearing, and the defendant Bi Haomin hired two lawyers, Wu Linkun and Xiao Baichuan, to defend him. He denied threatening with a firearm and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The hearing was postponed to summon witnesses for further questioning, as reported in previous newspapers.</p>
<p>Another Hearing Was Held Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>According to the defendant Bi Haomin, when I went to the plaintiff's office to negotiate, the plaintiff was standing inside the counter, and I was outside. The plaintiff hit me first. I wanted to hit him back, but I didn't hit him. It was hot that day, and I was wearing a suit. Because I was hit, I leaned over to avoid it, which exposed the firearm I was carrying, but there was no intention to threaten with it. The witness Zhu Huiming, presented by the plaintiff, testified that he was working at the British Consulate. He went to the plaintiff's company on that day to negotiate a loan and saw the plaintiff being pushed out from behind the counter, and the defendant was outside the counter trying to get inside.</p>
<p>Both Men Used Their Fists</p>
<p>The judge asked if Zhu had seen the defendant holding a firearm. He answered that he had not seen a firearm. The witness Li Linshu testified that he was a partner in the Bide Xing Oilskin Shop and also did business in military uniforms. On that day, he accompanied the defendant to the plaintiff's office. There were verbal disputes between the two parties, but the defendant did not threaten with a firearm. According to Liu Songtang, on August 4, he went to the plaintiff's office for business and saw the plaintiff and defendant arguing over the unsealing issue. The court reviewed the testimony and determined that the case was clear, and ordered closing arguments.</p>
<p>The Plaintiff's Attorney Presented Arguments</p>
<p>Requesting that the defendant be convicted and punished according to law. The defendant's attorney Wu Linkun argued that, according to the testimony of the witnesses, the defendant did not threaten with a firearm, which clearly shows that the defendant did not commit a crime. Moreover, according to Zhang Yimei's testimony in the police department, she also said that the defendant did not threaten with a firearm and was not prosecuted. He requested that the defendant be declared not guilty and that the plaintiff fabricated the facts to prosecute, intending to have the defendant subjected to criminal punishment. He requested permission for a counterclaim and that the defendant be convicted of false accusation. After lawyer Xiao added his opinion, the court ordered the closing of arguments and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Thugs Attack and Stab Theater Employee</h3>
<p>Lu Dalin, a 44-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 220 Baker Road, worked as an employee at a local opera theater near the Xiaocai Market on Seymour Road. At around 8:00 PM last night, more than a dozen thugs went to the theater to watch a free show. Lu Dalin went outside to stop them from entering. As a result, a verbal dispute occurred. Suddenly, the thugs pulled out sharp knives and stabbed Lu three times in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the thugs dispersed. Afterwards, someone hired a car to send Lu to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are serious and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company Reorganized</h3>
<p>In Accordance with the China Trade Act; Old and New Shares Have the Same Value</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company yesterday notified its shareholders in the city that the company's board of directors, at a meeting in New York on October 2, 1939, had adopted a proposal to reorganize the company, that is, to transfer all its assets and liabilities to a new company organized under the United States "China Trade Act." It is said that the specific purpose of this regulation is to assist various American enterprises in China and provide them with</p>
<p>Certain Benefits</p>
<p>Which cannot be obtained in accordance with the registration regulations of any state in the United States. This regulation has recently been amended to remove certain obstacles to re-registration. Following this plan, another company has been established in accordance with the "China Trade Act," named "Shanghai Telephone Company" "(Registered in the United States)." The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Council have also approved the transfer of the franchise granted to the company to the new company. Therefore, the proposed new company must exchange its shares for the old company's</p>
<p>Shares Exchange</p>
<p>Share for share, as the price for purchasing all the company's assets, and must assume all the old company's debts. The par value of the new company's shares is 10 Shanghai general currency units. Once the plan is completed, the new company will be the owner of all the old company's assets, assume all the old company's debts, and have the same number of shares as the old company, 1,151,420 shares with the same par value. After the old company returns its assets and Zhao Wu clears them, it will be dissolved. A special meeting of shareholders of the old company is scheduled to be held in</p>
<p>New York Convene</p>
<p>At that time, shareholders will be invited to consider authorizing the sale of all the company's property and the dissolution of the company. If the consent of the statutory majority of shareholders is obtained, shareholders will be notified to exchange their Shanghai Telephone Company shares for the same number of shares of "Shanghai Telephone Company (Registered in the United States)". The board of directors also set October 6, 1939 as the date for determining the company's shareholders at the special meeting and the date for voting rights, and notices and proxies were mailed to all shareholders yesterday. Given the current uncertain overseas postal period, the Shanghai office has found a way to collect proxies from shareholders residing in Shanghai on their behalf and send them to New York by airmail. Therefore, all shareholders must immediately seal the proxy after signing and witnessing it in the pre-printed envelope attached by the company and return it to the Shanghai office of the Shanghai Telephone Company.</p>
<h3>Fake "Consolidated Tax Bureau" Arbitrarily Establishes Affiliated Agencies</h3>
<p>The "Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau" has long been dissatisfied with the tax administration corruption by the authorities in the occupied areas. Since the establishment of the various district branches, recently, regardless of local commercial conditions and tax revenue, they have arbitrarily established various sub-bureaus and inspection and verification offices, wantonly exploiting merchants and civilians. "Director" Shao Shijun felt deeply uneasy (there is talk of immediate handover). Recently, in order to cover up the eyes and ears of the outside world, he specially "instructed" the various district branches that no affiliated agencies may be established without approval, which is actually just a piece of paper.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Introduces Commercial Maps</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce wrote, having recently received a letter from the Welfare Company, stating that the company recently published the Shanghai Street and Business Directory (also known as a commercial map), with the aim of enabling the city's business community to easily understand the current industrial and commercial situation, as well as the location of roads and public places, in order to help develop its industry. The entire book contains 140 street maps and 53 building maps, all of which are based on actual surveys and detailed drawings, so its content is exceptionally accurate. An advertising index is attached to the beginning, arranged in order of the number of strokes of the first character, making it easy to check. The binding is exquisite and the price is still the original price of six national currency units per copy. This book is necessary for general industrial and commercial enterprises. We especially request your association to promote it. We especially wrote to the various industry associations to widely introduce and encourage purchase among their respective industries. The above was received by the association. The association found that the street directory is a pioneering work in this city, with complete collection and transfer of information to its members, is of utmost importance. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Qi, October 5.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, I have been working hard to save the country in my own position, focusing on running a school, and have never heard of foreign affairs. I also feel that empty talk and advocacy movements cannot save the country. Now I see a news item in your newspaper about the Committee for Promoting Integrity and Shame, and my name is listed in it, which is very alarming. I hereby send a letter to declare that I have not joined the organization. Please publish it in the Letters to the Editor column. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Wang Zhicheng, October 18.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Running, Qin Lao</h3>
<p>I happened to see an article by a scholar in an old magazine, saying that he looked down on rickshaw pullers very much, because as soon as they saw the police coming to interfere, they didn't know any reason to talk, they just ran away. The conclusion of the article was: The people only know how to run.</p>
<p>This is very true. When the people see themselves as bare-handed and not organized, when they see people holding weapons who can control their lives, they naturally only run away. What else is there to do besides running? Preparing to be slapped or go to jail means you can't run. But unfortunately, people all have the instinct for self-preservation, even rickshaw pullers would not be stupid enough to accept being beaten or going to jail. Reasoning is naturally the most beautiful move, but unfortunately rickshaw pullers are not scholars, and their ability to reason is not very good. Even if they were good, the other party might not be willing to listen. As a result, there is really no other way but to run.</p>
<p>The people only know how to run. Who dares to say this is wrong? When they are caught, they run. When they are suppressed, they run. When they are bombed, they run even more. Looking at the major events in history, if you only focus on the people running, then it is almost a "history of running": At first, when the soldiers chased, everyone ran into the mountains; later, when the place became bigger, everyone ran to the seaside. Sometimes people in the city run to the countryside, and sometimes people in the countryside run to the city. Now that there are concessions, tens of thousands of refugees run to the concessions.</p>
<p>Scholars naturally look down on these. Because scholars first know how to reason, and secondly, even if they don't reason, they don't need to run. In history, we have seen a lot: when a new master arrives, scholars first offer articles and strategies, or wait for "imperial inquiries" and "recommendations", living very comfortably. Now, there's no need to say it.</p>
<p>However, the scholar's observation of the people is not necessarily correct. He only sees the bare-handed people who are not organized, and does not see the people who also have weapons in their hands and have become a team. At that time, the people will not only know how to run. They only know how to charge.</p>
<p>The running of the people is what we often see; the charging of the people is what we rarely see. But it is easy to see; as long as you force them to run, when they can no longer run, they will charge at you together. At that time, the scholars will probably be so scared that they will run away.</p>
<p>Looking at history, only focusing on the running of the people is naturally a "history of running". But in reality, every new era is charged out by the people. After charging, great men come out, and then the people start to only know how to run. Naturally, at this time, the scholars will come back. Then he goes to the street again to see the rickshaw pullers who don't know how to reason and only know how to run, expressing his contempt.</p>
<h3>Debate Tang Wei</h3>
<p>—Jie Hui Shi Ji—</p>
<p>Cheng is a famous debater in the Qianniu Fang. Soon after his arrival, he started another fierce debate.</p>
<p>Old Xiao put down his pipa, his thin lips pursed tightly, his not-so-bright eyes staring maliciously at him. Shi Yu was also listening to Cheng's speech calmly. …Except for Lao Chong, everyone else was like soldiers on the front line, their minds closely connected to their ears.</p>
<p>“This time, regarding the debate about 'Chang Xiang Si' (Note), although Gong Lei's attitude was good, I think Lao Hei failed in the 'Chapter Style' and 'Section System'!” He looked around and added, "Both 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and 'Water Margin' are in Chapter Style. Can you say that their value is lower than Jiang Guangci's works?"</p>
<p>"You can't compare it that way. You should know that the era is not a fixed toy. My article 'Whether Chapter Style Still Belongs to the Scope of Contemporary Novels' also mentioned this issue!"</p>
<p>Today, Old Xiao's demeanor was amiable, and he kept wetting his lips with saliva.</p>
<p>"Then, do you think the value of art has time limits?"</p>
<p>"Of course, there are time limits!" Shi Yu and Lao Xiao replied.</p>
<p>"I don't agree. As long as it's a successful work of art, it has its artistic value at any time."</p>
<p>"There is some truth in that!"</p>
<p>Rong Qiu took a deep breath, and his goldfish eyes suddenly turned a corner behind his glasses.</p>
<p>"Nonsense... You should know that the so-called artistic value has already had compositional differences between this era and that era!"</p>
<p>"You don't understand, you are not qualified to debate."</p>
<p>"The issue is going further and further!" Lao Chong interjected, "In short, a successful work not only has artistry but also social significance! Zheng Xiaoxu's founding declaration has such beautiful writing, but I believe it will never have value at any time!"</p>
<p>He tied a long braid on his head with a red silk scarf, causing laughter throughout the hall.</p>
<p>Although the topic had changed, Old Xiao was still unhappy. After a few minutes, he threw his hat on his head, grabbed his lover's arm, and walked away.</p>
<p>Note: "Chang Xiang Si" is a chapter-style novel written by Gong Lei, a reporter for the Harbin International Association Daily (that is, Gong Gan, a reporter for the Tianjin Mungus Daily). It caused a fierce pen war due to Shu Qun's criticism.</p>

<p>A story I know is actually a true story.</p>
<p>It is said that there was a wanderer who drifted from place to place like a mendicant monk, his long days woven into an endless journey.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the exhaustion of the long journey, or feeling weary, one day, he suddenly fell ill in a thatched inn. The morning light was hazy, and the rooster crowed at dawn, but he could not continue on his way as usual. What kind of world did the countless nights of dreams bring? Perhaps he picked up something in his dream? After that, he put away his ambition, returned to his hometown, and lived a peaceful life in seclusion.</p>
<p>"The Hu horse leans on the north wind, and the Yue bird faces the south branch," and people inevitably have thoughts of their hometown. Even if he has wandered the world for half his life, like the protagonist in this short story.</p>
<p>When you sit quietly in a chair or stroll in the garden, a common thing catches your attention. You stare at it, and you are transported far away; no matter what, you can't pull back the feet of imagination, and the courtyard and pavilions of your hometown appear before your eyes.</p>
<p>The magic of the hometown lures the hearts of wanderers. Can you forget the scent of your home?</p>
<p>The familiar song "On the Songhua River" lingers in my ears. It pulls my imagination to the distant other side. There once was a nest that warmed me there! The fledgling swallows fly south, and the old home has been destroyed. But how can the deep sorrow of home be dispelled?</p>
<p>I remember my hometown. "Although there are old dreams, I am unwilling to relive them." Indeed, it is a strong and down-to-earth state of mind; however, if nostalgia does not become sentimentality, it can also become a force to support the battle.</p>
<p>The flames of war have spread across the fields, and iron hooves gallop across the land. Friend, where is the pure land? Is your hometown safe?</p>
<h3>Lullaby Liu You</h3>
<p>Night</p>
<p>The wise Apollo also gives mankind a tune, making them feel gentle and serene lullabies.</p>
<p>Lullabies are great for young children. Mothers need thousands of songs, this little one is the most important. When their children feel impatient and babble, only hearing the clear, gentle, and beautiful song can make them feel unboring and enter the dreamland.</p>
<p>After losing childhood, sleep is no longer as long as it used to be. People are attached to work, cherishing their careers, and often sacrifice necessary sleep time when they are nervous. Therefore, lullabies are rejected and cannot be included in adult songs.</p>
<p>In order not to waste their precious lives, people love the hard-earned time and are unwilling to waste it in sleep. They feel disgust and hatred when they hear lullabies.</p>
<p>Lullabies seem not to know this. They are used by other people, making them extraordinarily beautiful and containing incredible seduction, using them as a poisoned wine to anesthetize people in order to achieve those people's goals, so that they can oppress others and conquer others.</p>
<p>People moving forward, pay attention to this lullaby!</p>
<h3>Scavenger She Mang</h3>
<p>Holding a cotton-padded black broken hook,</p>
<p>Strolling on the dark ring road;</p>
<p>Broken boots silently count the heavy footsteps,</p>
<p>The black bamboo basket behind him is towering.</p>
<p>Shaggy long hair breaks through the broken hat,</p>
<p>Angular lips squirm in the frustrating beard;</p>
<p>Revealing even more greedy eyes,</p>
<p>Eyes like the pupils of a black cat in the night.</p>
<p>Approaching the filthy bushes,</p>
<p>Flies swarmed over, sticking to the body,</p>
<p>Long trousers drag through the puddles of sewage,</p>
<p>Broken clothes are covered with decaying bone chips and soil stains.</p>
<p>Hands use the broken hook to turn over the layers of garbage residue,</p>
<p>Greedy eyes shoot out resentment,</p>
<p>Who can't see the flat and gorgeous street,</p>
<p>But wants to approach this foul-smelling stench.</p>
<p>Who doesn't have a home and hometown,</p>
<p>Who doesn't have the dearest loved ones;</p>
<p>However, everything is burned in the ghost's hands,</p>
<p>Only unforgettable hatred remains in the heart.</p>
<p>Ten thousand knots are tied in the wrinkled brows,</p>
<p>Ten thousand knots express ten thousand hearts.</p>
<p>Not afraid of passersby rolling their eyes and scolding, cursing and kicking,</p>
<p>Even more ignoring the pitying eyes that cover their noses and pass by,</p>
<p>Swallowing a bucket of sour tears,</p>
<p>Tears add hatred and strengthen footsteps.</p>
<p>From dusk to deep black,</p>
<p>The night does not allow the soul to rest in peace;</p>
<p>Risking the night's misery to pick up broken metal from the stench,</p>
<p>Tomorrow, when dawn comes, become a steel knife for revenge!</p>

<h3>Yu Qiaqing Marries His Granddaughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>— Southern Tunes and Northern Melodies</p>
<p>——Grand Hall Performance Featuring All the Famous Shanghai Actors——</p>
<p>The 23rd of this month is the wedding day of Mr. Yu Jiqi, the grandson of Mr. Yu Qiaqing (Ji Yun is the eldest grandson of the Yu family, the son of Mr. Shun'en). The wedding will be held at the New Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, busy with national affairs, did not want to overspend and kept it a secret beforehand. Only yesterday did various parties receive his invitations. People in the entertainment industry, knowing that Mr. Yu Qiaqing has always been very kind to them, voluntarily initiated a performance to show their appreciation. Performers from all Shanghai stages will participate. The Tianchan Stage, Gong Stage, and Great Stage are all performing daytime shows due to their own evening commitments (the repertoire is still being decided). On the Golden Theater side, Song Dezhu will perform "Water Flooding Jinshan Temple" with fight scenes. The top star of the Carlton Theater, Zhou Xinfang, and the top star of the Gong Stage, Zhao Ruquan, will co-star in "Battle of Changsha," with Zhou as Huang Zhong and Zhao as Guan Gong. Yuan Shihai, the famous Golden Theater Jing actor from the north and south, is specially invited to play Wei Yan. The cooperation of famous actors from the north and south makes it a perfect match. On the Renewal side, Shan Wu Suqiu will perform Spinning Cotton. These are all confirmed programs.</p>
<p>The entire New Asia Hotel will be booked on that day. The daytime show will start at 2 pm and end at 8 pm. From 8 pm to 12 am, amateur performers will perform. After 12 am, famous actors from various stages will perform until dawn. However, all the performers are participating voluntarily. The costumes, supporting roles, and miscellaneous expenses are all paid for from their own pockets, without the host spending a single penny. This shows how well Mr. Yu Qiaqing usually treats people in the entertainment industry! Otherwise, such a grand hall performance would not be possible, no matter how much money others spend!</p>
<p>The cast will be Jin Yutang, a combination of the Wu Yuehua and Han Jinkui troupes. Jin Yutang is a newly created costume box, complete with all roles and brand-new costumes. Wu and Han are also doing it all voluntarily out of respect for Mr. Yu Qiaqing.</p>
<p>Shanghai has not seen a good hall performance for a long time, and this hall performance for Mr. Yu Qiaqing's happy event is not initiated by him but passively, all voluntarily initiated by people in the entertainment industry, which shows the greatness of Brother Ade even more.</p>
<h3>Isolated Island Drama Talk — Starting with the Battle of Puyang</h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>Last week, I saw Wu Yanheng's "Battle of Puyang" at the Golden Theater. "Battle of Puyang" is a unique masterpiece of the Fu Liancheng Opera School. The protagonist, Lu Bu, was originally performed by Wu Xiaosheng. Among the students of Fu Liancheng, Ru Fulan was considered the best in this play. When Ru Fulan was at the school, he originally studied Wu Xiaosheng (he switched to Wu Sheng after graduation). Performing this play, paired with Han Fuxin's (who specialized in Wu Jing and has been in Tianjin for a long time, enjoying a good reputation in Tianjin) Dian Wei, was considered a difficult task. After Ru Fulan graduated, although he switched to Wu Sheng, he still performed "Battle of Puyang." Therefore, over time, the Lu Bu in this play became a dual role for Xiaosheng and Wusheng.</p>
<p>After Ru Fulan, there were two people in the Dang Liancheng Jiao class who performed this play: one was Wu Sheng Yang Shengchun, and the other was Xiaosheng Ye Shenglan.</p>
<p>Shengchun's play was his masterpiece, and he often performed it; Shenglan's play was no less than Shengchun's, but he did not perform it often. In recent years, both Shengchun and Shenglan have come to Shanghai and performed this play at the Golden Theater. However, Dian Wei and Cao Cao in this play occupy the same important position as Lu Bu. The performances of Shengchun and Shenglan in Shanghai either did not have a good Dian Wei or did not have a good Cao Cao (Yang Shengchun's Cao Huan was played by Liu Shengchang, and Ye Shenglan's Cao Duo was played by Zhang Qingcai from the Golden Theater troupe). Therefore, the performances were not very exciting due to the mismatched cast. Yesterday, I watched Wu Yanheng's performance, with Yuan Shihai as Cao Cao and Cheng Shaoyu as Dian Wei. Although Yanheng's performance cannot be compared with Ru Fulan's, it is above Yang and Ye, and the cast is well-matched, so the performance that day was even more exciting.</p>
<p>Yanheng has a voice and a good appearance. He is well-suited to play Lu Fengxian. Shihai's Cao Cao has the true inheritance of Hao Shouchun, which is beyond the reach of other actors. Although Cheng Shaoyu's Dian Wei is not yet proficient in his fight scenes with Yanheng, his facial makeup is beautiful and his appearance is burly, which is fitting for a great general. However, there was no fire on the stage, which reduced Shihai's body movements and made the plot worse. This is a real flaw. Yanheng rarely performs this play due to the supporting roles. In addition, plays such as "Cui Ping Mountain," "Qi Wu Mountain," and "Jia Family Mansion" have not yet been publicly performed.</p>

<h3>Dance Hall Sketches</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian (Forty-Six)</p>
<p>A Casual Talk About Two Dance Stars</p>
<p>In the Peking opera "Zhu Lian Zhai", the Second Wang Niang said to Li Keyong: "When you return in victory, there will be other benefits." Because Li Keyong was the King of the Shatuo Kingdom, he was honorable in status and rich in wealth, so she couldn't mention the word "reward" and had to say there were other benefits. For dance guests and dance hostesses, you could say they give a lot of money, but the actual word is "reward". And the dance hostesses of course only have "benefits" as a relative condition. Everybody be sure not to think about the dirty stuff. The benefits the Second Wang Niang gave Li Keyong, was just a table of wine, with her and her sister drinking together. As for the benefits the dance hostesses give the dance guests, they vary in light and heavy, big and small, with a thousand shapes and ten thousand forms, and can't be talked about in a single instance, and I can't write them all about for the moment, in short, they're "benefits".</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of the two dance stars I'm talking about in this piece, is that they don't take advantage of the guests, and don't treat them as suckers. Although their styles are different, their main ideas are the same. Who are they? One is Zhao Xuefang from the Paramount, one is Ru Aina from the Metropole. Ru Aina is delightful, her appearance is beautiful. She has a grandfather, a mother, and two foreign girls. She tells me about it with much joy. It is said that 2 years ago a guest wanted to enter a marriage alliance with her, and as the primary wife no less, but he wanted her to immediately drop out of the dance hostess life and go to school, study for 2 years, then have the wedding ceremony. As a result, the girl refused. Some people ask me, why do dance hostesses always love being dance hostesses? I say, it's because the well-fed don't know the suffering of the hungry. Try thinking about it, when she drops out of the dance hostess life, where will the household money for family living come from? Zhao Xuefang has bright eyes and a good smile, her deportment is graceful and dignified, she has an old mother, one younger brother, and one younger sister, and their maintenance, as well as the education expenses, all depend on what she earns with her 2 feet. When nobody is watching, her eyebrows are often frowning, with something of the appearance of Xi Shi holding her chest, like she has some kind of hidden worry. They won't swindle any money out of the guests, and they're even less daring to use an axe on them, so their business is pretty good. If the guests give them a fair return, they will also return to you a fair benefit. A friend said, "This isn't right, I've spent a lot of money on Zhao Xuefang, but I never got any benefit." I said, "Your thinking is wrong, she keeps you company while you have fun, keeps you company while you eat and drink, and talks and laughs with you, making you forget your sorrows, making you not feel lonely, is this not a benefit? As long as she's not taking advantage of you, and not swindling money out of you, then your money is well spent."</p>
<p>Finally, I must add a statement, it's not that other dance stars don't have this kind of benefit, and it's not that there are no good people besides Ru Aina and Zhao Xuefang, there are lots of good people in the dance hostess world. I just happened to discover it, and acting on the sacred mandate of hiding the bad and promoting the good, I'm praising them with a few words.</p>
<p>New Movie Introductions</p>
<h3>Until Tomorrow Comes (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"When Tomorrow Comes"</p>
<p>After watching "Until Tomorrow Comes," it is as if reading a chapter of clear and beautiful poetry, which makes people yearn for it; however, under the cooperation of two excellent actors, Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer, and through the artistic skills of director John M. Stahl, "Until Tomorrow Comes" is also a poignant and sad love story. Is it not? In every quiet and beautiful picture, there is a tongue of fire full of youth.</p>
<p>From the moment Charles Boyer met Irene Dunne, more than half of the film is devoted to depicting the subtle romance between the French musical conductor and the American coffee shop waitress. Throughout this lengthy process, the director firmly grasps the development of their emotions; and gives full play to his strengths, using lyrical strokes, so that the audience can also yearn for the situation encountered by the male and female protagonists. In particular, the two scenes where Charles Boyer accompanies Irene Dunne back to his apartment and spends the night in the church are as exquisite and delicate as possible. For example, in the first scene: after Irene Dunne goes upstairs, she first comes into contact with the photo of Bai Baolan (Charles Boyer's wife), and unintentionally flips to a photo of a child; while Charles Boyer picks up the photo of his wife, accompanied by the sound of thunder, these are all detailed foreshadowing. And when Charles Boyer starts playing the piano, a tracking shot when Irene Dunne goes downstairs is truly filled with beautiful emotion. In the second scene: they take refuge in the church, using lightning to introduce the interior of the church; lighting candles upstairs: when Irene Dunne uses a book as a pillow, Charles Boyer holds her in his arms, until the next day when the repairman goes upstairs to inform them that the downstairs is flooded, all of which shows John M. Stahl's unique lyrical style.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Silver and Gold Problem in the Ulong Courtyard Play</p>
<p>Chao Tianwang of Liangshan and the Luo brothers, because they were grateful to Third Master Song for saving their lives when they seized the birthday tribute, ordered Liu Tang to write a letter, risking great danger, to prepare to invite Song Jiang to the mountain as king, in order to express their sincerity in drinking water and remembering the source of gratitude; at the same time, they brought him a gold ingot as a small token of thanks or travel expenses. In fact, in terms of Song Jiang preserving their seven lives, of course, a gold ingot is still too thin, but with such a gesture of inviting him to the mountain as king, even if the gift Liu Tang hurriedly brought with him was meager, it would not be unreasonable. Moreover, they did not fundamentally believe that a mere gold ingot was enough to express their gratitude, it was just to bring Third Brother Song some travel expenses. However, given Chao Gai's position as the king of Liangshan, since he specially ordered Liu Tang to bring some money to Song Jiang, then a silver ingot would be impossible to present. Moreover, Third Master Song was also a good friend with extensive social connections and generous with money. For the sake of Yan Poxi, he casually spent three hundred taels of silver to buy her home, and then built a Wulong Courtyard, the silver used was also not a small amount. If Liu Tang handed over a silver ingot that was only at most fifty taels after handing over the letter in the restaurant, I think Third Master Song, who had spent money and seen money, would definitely not look at him straight in the eye, and would repeatedly thank him and refuse to accept it. Furthermore, the weight of gold and silver is very different, so the size of the silver ingot is also very different; to say that it was a silver ingot weighing fifty taels, I am afraid that it would not be convenient to put in the Zhao Wen bag, and at the same time, Yan Poxi's delicate jade hands could not casually pick it up with two fingers and casually stuff it into her arms.
