<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本閣員演辭之檢視</h3>
<p>日本國會年會，隔昨開慕；閣員自首相以决，循例蒞會，各按職分，敷陳抱負。彼邦夙以每年歲首爲政治季節，而議院實爲之重心，有聲有色，內外視聽繫焉。今則軍閥跋扈，政黨沒落，議院乃如告朔餼羊，徒爲政治儀仗中應時應景之點綴而已。撫今追昔，何堪慨歎，而影響所及，非僅一國一事之不幸；期以光復舊觀，其亦惟中國抗戰勝利之後乎！雖然，閣員之到院演說，原非專爲議員而發；而彼議院之氣息奄奄，正以內閣之權威赫赫；是以在院演辭，不問其內容之虛虛實實，自其本質言之，耍爲應予注意之資料。况在戰時，辭涉遠東者獨多乎！</p>
<p>電傳日本閣員隔昨之登壇說法者四人：首相平沼，外務大臣有田，陸軍大臣坂垣，海軍大臣米內。米內演辭，傳之不詳。坂垣演辭有足述者，彼謂中國軍隊集於平漢路之西，的十七萬人；長沙南昌間　的三十萬人；廣東省境，的二十萬人；廣西省境，的十五萬人；四川雲南兩省，二百十師，的一百萬人云；綜彼所舉，共的一百八十二萬人。中國軍隊究竟如何雄偉，爲另一問題，對方於上述區域內所估計者則若此。他若大江下游，津浦左右，與長城內外，廣大遼闊之遊擊戰區，以及陝甘與西北諸腹地，蘊蓄潛在之實力，皆在彼所計之外者也。</p>
<p>平沼與有田之演辭，應爲世界視綫之焦點，顧乃絕無較新之提示；空虛浮泛，色厲內荏；意者，此可象徵勞師遠征，久而無功之侵略國家之國勢者乎？歸納二人所言，盤旋不外於所標榜之新秩序說；他如以傀儡組織爲所謂之「中國新政府」，以反對共產爲侵華之口頭禪，以分肥爲迎合侵略者之甘餌，類皆舉世久已厭聞而莫或置信之濫調也。誠使電傳之演辭而旣盡其精采，則演辭絕無價値可言；顧其間亦有可以稱異者；以英美兩國最近對日之態度强硬，而平沼有田僅籠統其辭，竟不敢明舉日英若美，以稍攖其鋒。以彼口口聲聲於反共，則僅挾德義協定以自重，而謂與蘇聯僅爲鑛權漁業而糾紛。以法屬安南之瞻顧徬徨，中國顧維鈞大使甫在國聯行政院加以指摘，顧乃有田獨抉爲非難之對象日：「法屬安南方面之對華軍火運輸，如仍繼續不已，則日本决定採取適當之應付」云。以此對付數國之態度相提而並論之，其間電輕抑揚，幾難倫比；豈日愛憎，豈曰利害？衡以歷史與現實，雖謂恩怨厚薄適得其反，亦無不可，夫其故何哉？察彼偏頗，可以覘知日本當局無可奈何之情緒矣。蓋干犯衆怒，情勢日非，舉無足以告慰其人民，而又欲示人民以對外之不弱，於是故作猙獰，佯示尙有「决定採取適當應付」之勇。明知中國之國際交通，不一其路綫；虛聲恫嚇旣於事無濟，遮斷交通復力有不逮，若冒險嘗試則更將獲咎於强大，於是避實就虛，獨稱安南。抑此外亦非絕無他意存焉。今日日本之於國際，惟民治諸國協力是虞；誠有其術而使諸國各不相謀，置身事外，則日本愈得肆無忌憚，一意孤行；獨稱安南者，是彼在外交上以各個擊破之戰略，小試之於民治諸國而已。况以反共協定之爲連索，日與德義，儼然一氣，德義軸心之於歐洲，方謀離間英法，且集矢於法；日本訐法，亦所以示德義以桴鼓之應。更自軍事策略言之，日本海軍覬覦中國之海南島最切，瀺涎欲滴而不能無所顧忌於法國；則今之訐法者，正所以爲他日藉口佔領海南島之伏錢，亦未可知也。</p>
<p>平沼有田之演說，在彼國會；國會開幕之觀禮者，有東京外交團；德義代表殆忻然於防共協定之可供演辭作資料，蘇聯代表殆鑒彼虛張聲勢而作會意之微笑；獨美英法三國代表手致抗議如彼，而耳聞日本當局之表示若此，是不應一念及於如何繼抗議之後乎！</p>
<h3>英政府對華　續作經濟上援助　中國各界為之稍慰　渝報盼望列强對日　採取更進一步行動</h3>
<p>（重慶）倫敦每日民聲報所傳英國對華貸款三百萬鎊、以供援助中國法幣之用、其佈置事宜、已將就緒之消息、可略减華人各界對於國聯行政院所通過中國决議案、所感覺之失望、中央日報載稱、是項借款、爲英國對華作更積極援助之徵象云（廿二日路透電）</p>
<p>（重慶）今日中國政府高級官員與美聯社記者討論倫敦「每日民聲報」關於英國貸款予華之報吿時、表示甚爲樂觀、但與孔祥熙接近之官員則不願作任何評論、彼等謂、吾等無權吿君以貸款之事、又財政界對英國貸款予華事、似認爲一定能成功、至確實數目則現猶未悉、觀察家指英美二國貸款予華、係二國反對日本軍事侵略中國之一種姿態、（二十二日美聯電）</p>
<p>（重慶）今日中國各黨報評論云、法國政府繼美英之後致日照會、巳於本月十九日送達日本外務省、法國照會的全文、迄今尙未發表、但據巴黎十八日哈瓦斯電、巴黎負實人士宜稱、『法國政府曾在此項照會中聲明、凡以片面行動修改九國公的之所爲、均非法國所能承認、日本在中國境內所欲樹立之「新秩序」、實與此項公的相抵觸、而足以妨害法國所保有之權利、自非法國所能苟同、』據上電所云、足見法政府與日照會的內容、與美英兩國對日照會的內容大致相同、其要點爲（一）凡片面以武力修改九國公的之行動、不能承認、（二）日本所謂之「東亞新秩序」、實與九國公的相抵觸、而足以妨害華會各國所保有之權利、自中日戰事發生以後、九國公的簽字的重要團家如英美法等國、他們的態度早已顯明他們對於遠東問題的認識極明白而正確、然而他們同時採取類似的行動、用坦直的態度與堅决的語句警吿日本、此决尙爲第一决、這是英美法採取平行行動的第一聲、足以證明英美法等國爲擁護九國公的與恢復遠東的國際秩序與正義和平、巳準備由消極的抗議、轉而採取積極的措置、英美法的政府與人民巳感覺日本在遠東的非法侵略與破壞條的的行爲、决不是抗議所可制止的、他們必須坦直的堅决的說明他們的立塲、並設法採取積極行動、而且這種積極行動必須是平行的、然後始能發生威力、簽訂九國公的的重要國家、除身當其衝之中國外、當首推美英法日四國、而意大利不與焉、我們只須看在華會期中、英美法日四國爲維持太平洋與遠東的和平所簽訂的四國協定、並沒有包括羲大利在內、我們就可以知道簽訂九國公的的最重要的國家、只是美英法日四國、現在日本單方以武力破壞條的實行侵略政策、硬說九國公的已不適用於今日的情形、該的必須修改、以便樹立日本所謂的「新秩序」、但簽訂九國公的的其他重要國家、却個別發表共同一致的見解、駁斥日方的謬論、認爲（一）九國公的在中日事變前、巳獲得當日預期的良好效果、（二）今日遠東的情形、完全爲日本以非正式的武力手段所造成、（三）九國公的的原則在事實上在法理上、仍適用於今日、（四）單方以武力修改公的的行動、各國不能承認、（五）日本所謂的「新秩序」與現存的有效的章完全抵觸、各國决不能接受、中國是身當其衝的國家、中國的意見姑置不論、但簽訂九國公的的重要國家、而同時又非此决事變的當事國美夾法三國都由個別的觀察、而得着共同一致的結論、這當然不是偶然的、就是簽訂九國公的的其他國家與非九國公的簽字國而在太平洋上有重要關係的國家、他們現時雖然沒有對日致送照會、但是除一二別具野心的國家外、其觀察與結論、與美英法三國此决對日照會的內容大抵亦屬一致、這可以於他們過去的言論與行動中看出、上述各點、足以證明日本的言論荒謬、日本的行動非法、列國對於遠東問題的認識、已極淸楚、立塲已極堅决、態度亦復坦白、措詞亦復率直、所差者僅爲積極而堅决的行動而已、我們一方盼望英美法等國能迅速採取積極的行動、一方更將加强我們自己抗戰的努力、以與世界上愛好正義和平、擁護條的信義的國家、共同製裁遠東的侵略者、以恢復太平洋塲的國際秩序、</p>
<p>此次法國致日本的照會、其目的固在維護「法國保有之權利」、但同時亦在維持國際正義與的章的尊嚴、我們對法政府與人民願表示甚深的謝意、法國到底不愧爲愛好自由和平的大國、無愧於他們大革命時代的祖先、法國現在在歐洲的處境頗爲困難、但他在遠東的地位與利益、自亦不能置之不顧、懲一儆百、法國在遠東與英美合作的結果、或將有利於歐洲問題的和平解决、日本爲侵略者組合中的最弱的一環、要恢復世界上的國際秩序、必須自制裁日本起始、（二十二日電）</p>
<h3>華官方評　有田演辭　恐嚇與利誘兼施　列强决不為所動</h3>
<p>（重慶）中國官方人士對於平沼及有田在東京日本國會中之演詞、不願加以批評、謂其僅重複申述關於組織束亞新秩序之陳語、惟指出有田之語、應認爲繼續輕視英美之地位、忽視最近英美對日所提出之强硬牒文、自另一方而言之、有田亦竭力恐嚇法蘇兩國、英美兩國均無相信日本之甜言蜜語之可能、法國及蘇聯亦均不致受日本之虛張聲勢所威脅、日本曾屢决向法國抗議由越南運輸軍火之事、日本倘再作此種恐嚇、僅表現其視全文明世界爲敵人而已法蘇兩國均係國聯會員國、均願遵守國聯帮助中國抵抗軍事侵略之决議、法蘇兩國、决不致因日方之口頭恐嚇而屈服、（廿二日美聯電）</p>

<h3>日本環境　漸趨不利　各報之觀察</h3>
<p>（柏林）日本在外交上軍事上所處地位、頃由穗國各報加以評論、其中弗朗克孚城日報謂「觀于美國政府最近採取之各項决定、日本所處環境至屬可悲」、美國當局茲已决定在太平洋上各島嶼設置防禦工事、日本因此卽有在軍事上遭受包圍之危險、又况美國行動幷不以此一端爲限、如美英法三國以措詞强硬之照會送致日本一也、英美兩國以款項貸予中國二也、凡此不利于日本、均屬彰彰明甚、柏林交易所日報登載地圖一幅、標指美國政府所擬增闢之各海軍根據地、並謂「按之羅斯福總統所定方針、足見美國有向東南方面進取之意、此項威脅之于日本、尤爲顯明、東京方面因此大爲震動、華盛頓政府意志所在、乃以重大壓力加諸日本、此在美國人民實無法加以反對、溯自蘇聯內部糾紛迭出、以致國力削弱以來、其進攻各全能國亦卽反共公的各簽字國之一項行動、已由美國起而代之矣」云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>泰晤士報　警吿日本</h3>
<p>（倫敦）著名評論家筆名「檢討家」今日在星期日泰晤士報發表一文、於力言日本對華條件、如何不能爲英美所接受外、謂英國致日本之牒文、係謹愼說明英國並不堅持任何條的之文字、如日木果重視兩國之友誼、則此項牒文實予以恢復友誼之機會、吾人應向世人闡明和平之成因、並不依賴仟何一國或列强聯合以保存過去·近來及遠期政治狀態之能力、吾人甚或自願讓步、認日本爲中國天然之合夥、惟日本須完全改變其態度、爲援助而非欺凌弱者、並須以較高尙之雄心、代替軍閥之專制主義、日本對英美兩國對中日事件意見之密切符合、應勿置諸不理、蓋英美爲中國計、爲自身計、均應如此、日本當勿忘美國對華素極親善、平日對於太平洋、較大西洋更爲注意、正如鬥羅主義之使美國處於加拿大聯合保護人之地位然、菲列濱之存在、使美國對於澳洲及香港成爲英國之天然聯盟、以抗外來之侵略、及保護民族權利以拒橫暴之勢力云、該文末段、詳析德義兩國關於遠東之地位、允其爲穗國、其地位不甚光明、該文之結論曰、防共公的樹立惡習慣之力量、殊屬過於荏弱、並將使其較弱小之一二參加份子感覺失望云、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）關於英法成立臨時協定、開辦橫貫北大西洋定期航空事，此間政界人士頃加以評論稱、法政府之措施、殊堪滿意、迨本年春季、此項航空綫即可開辦搭載客貨運送郵件諸事宜、但經營之者、由美國一家航空公司承辦或由數家合辦、尙未確定、其中如泛美航空公司與美國航空出口公司、會於去歲十月間成立協定、彼此將北大西洋航空綫營業範圍予以劃分、（即北歐洲並斯坎蒂那維亞半島在內、劃歸泛美航空公司營業範圍、地中海沿岸各國並北菲洲在內、以及亞洲西部直至波斯灣爲止、則劃歸美國航空出口公司營業範圍）茲依照美法兩國臨時協定、則兩公司殆將會同經營、聞每星期往返飛行不在四次以上、此間政界人士對於此事、並謂美國與歐洲各民治國旣完成其空中交通錢、此後若歐洲方面發生衝突時、此項航空錢之意義、允必見其重大云（二十二日合瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法政府新任命　遠東艦隊司令</h3>
<p>（巴黎）政府頃發表命令內開、海軍參謀部高級參謀特古少將、普級中將、任爲駐遠東艦隊司令、戴婁少將任爲駐越南艦隊司令（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>大西洋面　美海空軍會操　本月杪開始爲期兩月　試驗保衛新大陸力量</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社（華盛頓航空通訊）第八屆泛美洲大會所簽訂之「里瑪宣言書」、墨瀋未乾美國艦隊卽已駛往加勒比安海面舉行大規模演習、俾以顯著的意義、畀予「美洲大陸聯帶關係」一項嶄新的主義、此項海軍演習、當自本月杪開始、至三月中旬結束、美國海軍主力包括各級軍艦一四〇艘。飛機五〇〇架。官兵五三〇〇〇員名、在海軍總司令白洛克上將統率之下、均當參加其事、其演習區域、自美國維爾琴尼亞州諾福克港起、迄至南美洲巴西海岸止、其面積的佔四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇方哩、西印度羣島與大西洋中部各軍略地點均皆包括在內、其中允爲注重者、厥爲巴拿瑪運河區域、按之預定計劃、演習艦隊分爲黑白兩隊、白色艦隊爲攻方、由嘉爾夫斯少將統率、希圖駛近美國東南部海岸或西印度羣島而獲有據點、俾克進攻巴拿瑪運河、黑色艦隊爲守方、由妥特魯斯少將統率、其任務乃在阻止攻方勿令登陸、查此項演習程序、在「里瑪宣言書」簽字之前、卽由宮方予以宣佈、良以巴拿　運河乃美國海軍之筦鑰、與大西洋太平洋防務均屬有關、中美洲各國不問其贊成與吾、事實上必須劃入大陸防守計劃範圍以內故也、</p>
<p>爲參加演習起見、太平洋艦隊業於本月初間分自加州聖第哥港與聖比特魯港出發、駛過巴拿瑪運河、前往加勒比安海面、美國海軍政策素以保有「大洋艦隊」一隊、以之兼顧大西太平兩洋防務爲基礎、是以此項艦隊駛過巴拿瑪運河之速度、實乃他日對外作戰時决定勝負之主要關鍵、此項演習所由特別注重於運河區域者、其故亦卽在此、</p>
<p>抑本年海軍演習地點、擇定大西洋與加勒比安海面、幷非出於偶然、其與歐洲時局之演進、不無關係、自可斷言、在過去數年中、美國海軍多在太平洋方面、卽北自阿留申羣島起、西至太平洋中部各島嶼、東迄美國西部海岸之海面舉行演習、其假想的作戰對象乃爲日本、自屬顯而易見之事、迄至本年、忽改在大西洋方面演習、此非日本威脅已見輕减之謂、實乃大西洋方面局勢變更有以致之、蓋以穗義兩國旣在積極擴充海空陸軍、各該國允其是德國、又復希圖在拉丁美洲各國市塲、佔有較爲强固的地位、因此大西洋問題之重耍性、巳與包含戰事危機之太平洋問題相埒矣、</p>
<p>美國政府當局對於此種外來的威脅、知之甚諗、爰乃决定在各方面發出表示、用以警吿各全能國、在外交上促成「里瑪宣言書」一也、在經濟財政上决定援助拉丁美洲各國二也、在政治上以極端强硬的語調、對付德國、如因德國徘猶運動而召回駐德大使三也、其在軍事上、則舉行此决大規模演習、用以發揚美洲大陸聯帶關係四也、準是而論、本年美國海軍演習、殆可目爲對付東來襲擊之一種表示、</p>
<p>據官方一再表示、此决演習僅係實施海軍當局計劃已久之方案、而與國外時事毫無關聯、特按之政府向國會所提出之國防計劃、大西洋防務旣須充實至空前未有之程度、空軍實力更須提高至不畏任何挑釁之水準、蓋以此决大規樓演習、足見美國之意、乃欲準備在現行各項國際爭端中、以决定的方式、一伸其强大的威力明矣、</p>
<h3>德向中東歐南美　發展國外貿易　料將推行物物交換政策　英美起與競爭勢所不免</h3>
<p>（倫敦）德國經濟部長芬克、繼沙赫特博士兼任中央銀行總裁事、頃由此間實業界人士加以評論、咸謂英德兩國在中歐東歐以及南美洲之貿易、此後殆將競爭愈烈、緣芬克素來竭力推行以貨易貨之政策、此後彼所力求進展者、或將不出二途、卽（一）中歐洲東歐洲各國、多已成爲德國附庸、芬克將根據以貨易貨政策、向各該國推廣貿易、（二）以此政策爲出發點、而與南美洲各國促進商務關係、增進德國勢力、而擯逐英美商品於南美洲市塲之外、果爾、英國自當放棄與德國改善貿易關係之計劃、例如不列顚帝國實業聯合會原擬與德國實業恊會進行談判、討論各處市塲分配辦法、商務大臣史丹萊對此問題、並曾謂內閣當在「道義上予以贊助」、但目前情况旣殊、自惟有勸吿帝國實業聯合會放棄談判之議、不寗唯是、英國政府並當依據出口信用擔保局擴大權限法、竭力增加出口信用放款、俾英國各出口商人得與德國商人在國外市塲相競爭、如此應付、皆意料中事云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼　發表演說　譏刺反法西斯蒂</h3>
<p>（羅馬）墨索里尼首相、頃右此間阿根廷戲院向農民數千人發表演說、一再以譏諷之辭、涉及法義兩國緊張現象、其言有日、「法國若果固執成見、則義國更能固執成見」、又日「余曾于去歲九月間指述吾國敵人過于愚拙、實不足爲患、時至此日、余仍以此言爲不誣、」又曰、「某國報紙對于法西斯主義之謾駡、余若取以轉吿爾等、爾等必捧腹大笑、笑聲所及、可使阿爾卑斯山彼方京城所有玻窗爲之震碎無遺」、又曰、「外國方面反法西斯之態度、不可救藥、固不足恤、顧於整個義大利問題、竟亦茫無所知、則其愚誠不可及」云云、諸如此類不一而足、其結論則對于義國現行農業政策、宣揚不置、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>有人圖刺　張伯倫</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據昨日晚報載、警廳接得通訊稱有人企圖謀害張伯倫之生命、是以張氏行踪所到之地、均有武裝警察嚴密防護、孟却斯德之警察昨日發現大量爆炸物、並捕獲一人、（廿二日海通社電）</p>
<h3>史汀生函請赫爾　撤消運西軍火禁令</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）赫爾國務卿頃發表談話稱、余已接有前任國務卿史汀生來函、要求將禁運軍火前往西班牙一項命令、予以撤消云、史汀生現在長島、頃用電話向此間哈瓦斯社訪員發表談話稱、余久已認爲西班牙乃獨裁制與民治制之戰塲、美國多數名流曾促余出而爲西班牙共和政府主持公道、祇因賤軀不適、迄未如願、頃已函達赫爾國務卿、請其將禁運軍火命令予以撤消矣、按史汀生甫於日昨會同美國各界名人組成「勿助長日本侵略」委員會、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於禁止以軍火運往西班牙命令、宜予撤消事、可靠消息史汀生氏並曾聲明如决、美國政府現行政策、已使西班牙共和政府蒙其不利、亟須予以矯正、依照美國審法、羅斯福總統原有撤消此項禁令之權、不必徵求國會同意故請國務卿以此意轉達總統云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>偽蘇省府　組偽護路會　是奉承日軍意旨</h3>
<p>蘇州通訊、偽省府近奉日軍部令、積極組織偽護路會、紛請各界人士加入、蓋京滬路綫游擊隊極爲活躍、時將橋路拆毀、日軍乃用高壓手段、責成偽省府籌劃保護、聞該偽會已籌備就緒、不日將開成立會、吳縣城廂所駐日軍殊尠、各門均裝置碉堡、以防游擊隊襲擊、西郊因游擊隊活躍、故日軍戒備綦嚴、縣屬各地、因日軍時往騷擾、均紛紛組壯丁隊、藉資保衛地方、</p>
<h3>蘇錫常　業主收取租米問題　游擊隊活動之牽制　日偽經濟遭受影響</h3>
<p>蘇州通訊、照承平時習慣、鄉間業戶、向佃農收取租米、每逢舊曆冬至節、卽須結束、現在情形、旣呈特別化、收租問題、談何容易、猶憶前年田租、以蘇州·常熟·無鍚·三縣此較、蘇州最好、常熟次之、今歲則大謬不然、茲將該三縣收租情形、槪述如次、</p>
<p>常熟田租以東鄉最好、西南鄉因與吳縣南北橋區毘連、較爲减色、其征收方法、歸多數業主自動在鄕設莊合作征收、名日某某租棧、由各田主推舉主任一人、處理收租事務、旣不接收任何命令、又無任何組織、折價定每米一石、實收六元、計算推動、亦極順利、至國曆年底止、各租棧已征起現款十餘萬、</p>
<p>無錫田租、最近收數以東南鄕爲最好、征收方法、仍由田主各自照常征收、每區設追租所、折價每米一石、收七元一角、連麥租在內、各鄕佃農與田主平日好威者、仍照常自動織租、至年底止、全縣約征起十五萬元左右、</p>
<p>蘇州田租、係偽方與無恥田主、合組偽「租賦併收局」、偽分局有十四處、其實僅有木凟橫涇等處、征起三萬餘元、其最受打擊者、是南北橋偽區長李朝元、被游擊隊槍殺後、各偽分局僞員、均畏懼不敢前往、南北橋偽分局長周懷萱、見勢不佳、卽行辭職、僅留一燒火夫看管空屋、雖有佃農到局繳租、亦無人敢受、所以說是去年十二月一日租賦一律啟征、全屬欺人之談、至今歲一月十日、南北橋偽分局、由允全望爲偽局長、欲急迫收租、壓榨農民、討好偽方、又恐游擊隊襲來、徒送性命、亦虛張聲勢而已、偽方對此棘手無策、卽欲向日方請求派日偽軍下鄉保護、事實上鄉區遼闊、亦難各鄉一一派駐、所以蘇州收租、並無具體辦法日僞經濟收入、遂遭嚴重影饗、</p>

<h3>虹口區內　日竟擴充警權　國內調來日警六十餘名　虹口添設警察分署五處</h3>
<p>虹口開放之談判、稽延年餘、因日方並無歸還警權誠意、故迄今尙無解决希望、茲悉日方最近竟在虹口東北二區內、擴充日籍警察之事權、除將日領事館警察名額特別增多外、並在楊樹浦路·吳淞路·北四川路·施高塔路·及狄司威路等處、各添設分署一所、一面又在日本國內調來警察六十餘名、分司其事、此舉顯有代替捕房行使警權之嫌、租界當局正予注意、</p>

<h3>甬輪限制客票水脚案　虞洽卿電陳意見　戰後水脚增高各輪均獲盈餘　便利土產運銷應沽四折收費</h3>
<p>關於滬甬錢各輸、因戰後客票水脚、繼長增高、加重浙東民衆負担、影響土產運銷、故曾由鄞縣黨政軍警法聯席會議第一二六决會議决予以限制、並分令各輸公司遵照、本市航業界鉅子義商中意公司華總經理虞洽卿氏、昨特電甬、詳陳意見、原文云、寗波陳縣長·俞局長·曁商會周主席·勛鑒、讀甬航會奉聯席會議訓令第二七八號、以擄商會呈請</p>
<p>限制船票水脚</p>
<p>經第一二六决會議議决、最近水脚價目、概照七折計算、艙票價目、限定統艙一元五角、房艙四元、官艙六元、茶房小賬、聽客酌給、不得强案、飭各輪遵照等因、具徵體恤維護至意、敝公司欣聞之餘、自當遵照、惟對於統艙票價、及脚貨折扣兩項尙有請求注意及解釋之處、不得不重加聲明、爰敝公司上年規定之滬甬統艙票價二元、係</p>
<p>包括茶房酒資</p>
<p>在內、皮時絕對禁止勒索現在訂定小賬、聽客酌給、在此政令重申之初、或可遵守一時、但茶房積習成性、稍一疏懈、即易乘機施其故技不久將來、恐有酒資相等票價、或超過之流弊、應請特加注意、至於脚貨價目、八一三後、業已增加數次、如上年五月間、太古。寗紹。與敝公司因鑒於煤價飛漲、聯合商議、訂立新水脚、籍資彌補施行迄今、敝公司與太古依然遵守嗣後</p>
<p>滬甬禁止直航</p>
<p>各輪借繞道溫台名目、將前定水脚加倍提高、貨客受累、痛苦不貲、敝公司目覩情形、始終維持三公司原價、不忍加收、免增客家担負、現在商會呈准限制水脚、在當局爲體恤商艱、在商會爲維護會員、立意至可欽佩、但貨脚七折計算、似乎貨客方面、仍米受其實惠、故敝公司曾於篠日電陳郭司令、主張除棉花外、大宗貨如絲、繭·茶葉·紙類·錫箔等、</p>
<p>應照四折實收</p>
<p>蓋大宗貨均爲富華公司農本局、及各貨運銷處專司運輸、前二者受政府撥付經費、後者得各業補助開支、均無收取佣金必耍、若另星貨、則概照五折、再給八五報關行儸金、以示優遇、一俟滬甬直航、煤費航期均可較省時、當再行酌减、以利土產之暢運、且目前由甬出口者、並非完全我浙東之土產、皖南贛湘各處</p>
<p>轉道甌甬出口</p>
<p>者、爲數尤屬可觀、名輪船值此土產擁擠之秋、减低水脚、其營業定能裕盛、觀乎寗紹所租之開波、三北所租之恩德者、即照水脚對折計算、每月尙可盈餘數萬元、想見營業之盛况、與夫水脚减低之需要、和德經營航業、垂數十年、對於土產運銷、農村救濟、向抱兼顧志願、此處减低水脚、固屬我政府維持農村之意、惟是否依照上年五月間訂定價目、予以七折、抑照現在由溫台繞道之水脚折取、關係至大、出入至巨、蓋照上年五月間之價目、七折計算相去尙屬不多、若照溫台繞道之水脚、七折收取、貨客方面、仍屬無從受惠、應請詳　示復、無任盼禱、虞和德叩號、</p>

<h3>新婚的生理變化　及精力衰退原因</h3>
<p>— 俄車勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>靑年男女互相愛戀，心上老刻畫着意中人的倩影，懷抱甜蜜的理想，這是多麼美而且樂的事啊？！若再天從人愿進而結成正式夫婦；心上的戀人成了偕隨百年的伴侶，這種新婚甜蜜的樂趣，不是更使人迷醉的麼。</p>
<p>但是在結婚——結成新夫婦的期間，無論肉體上或是精神上，都要生出種種的變化，這種變化完全是一種生理的現象在處女時代或是在童男時代未會經過的一種生理現象。雖然對於新夫婦身心方面，不發生很大的影饗，但有時也許有些害處。</p>
<p>在身體變化中，最使人容易察覺；要算是新娘子肥胖一事了。這是什麼道理呢？原來因結婚夫婦同居的結果，新娘體內便發生了一種醱酵素，自能釀造脂肪，增加新娘的體重了，這在醫學上講，呌做精細胞血化作用，爲新婚女子最初的一種變化。</p>
<p>其决，新婚的夫婦要想走進「愛之樂園」尙需相當努力，相當期間。在新婚當時，女子因了恐懼或是身體過勞，對於夫婦生活不大感覺興趣，所以丈夫要多方開導，使不知不覺間習慣了夫婦生活那就好了</p>
<p>要使「愛的基礎」鞏固，必須使夫婦雙方的健康，蓋夫婦間的生殖機能健全，雖不能認爲夫婦生活全部幸福，最低亦可認爲和好的關鍵，生殖機能若不得美滿，家庭中决不會幸福的，所以夫婦應當努力保持此部機能的健康才是。</p>
<p>吾人的健康，在婚前若不知衛生，顯然會發生變化。但是在新婚後體格之變化，可說與婚前相等。有許多人，在未結婚前，本是一個精强力足，面色紅潤的靑年，不料新婚後，即變成形影削瘦，面色蒼白者，未嘗沒有。而婚前精力不振，經新婚後頓易健美者，亦屬常有，不過此種原因，均與不攝生有關，而於婚前失健者，多由自凟過度而來。在婚後失健者，則由房事不節所致，早洩，腎萎，發育不全，都屬此種原因。其補救方法，服畢丸精質製劑男用「補體康」爲最對症，良由該劑功能增精補血，促進生殖器的發育，歐美無數之專家，均知該劑藥力準確，爲治療神經衰弱，未老先衰及上述幾種生殖機能衰退的特效製劑，凡婚後健康衰退者，服此廿四小時卽生精補腎。蓋夫婦間之愛情，實建築於健康的基礎，而此基礎，惟有「補體康」可以鞏固之。</p>
<h3>遺精內服藥優劣的分野</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>近時靑年，大都受惡環境的影響，好倡自由，不受的束，荒蕩侈奢，流於浪漫，故多遺精之症。此由於性慾無度者，其他一部份自好之靑年，則叉刻苦砥礪，奮勉有加，兼之不景氣現象，到處皆然，感於生活之壓迫，經濟之恐荒，叉不得不努力奮鬥，以解决其生活問題；因心神之太勞，神經漸决轉爲衰弱。由此造成遺精症者蓋比比然也</p>
<p>關於本症的治法，第一須避免過勞，從事於增精補血，促進新陳代謝的機能。每日三吹服以睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，每次三片，頗有治療神經衰弱失眠，及腰酸背痛，未老先衰等症，不論其病狀如何沉重，大有着手回春之妙，如若祇感遣精頻繁，則應兼服「耐而斯遺精片」，保證根治，蓋兩藥藥性如和平，絕無副作用。與其他劣藥不可同日而語</p>

<h3>再談短期治淋問題　美國醫學博士英仲昌</h3>
<p>……淋菌之生命在試騐管與人體內各有不同之點　……以試騐管內之淋菌生命判治療長短實大錯誤</p>
<p>關於淋病短期是吾可以根治之問題，余已爲文發表於本刊。茲意猶未了，特再言之，以就正於方家。</p>
<p>淋毒之病原菌，人皆知爲雙球菌，而不知雙球菌之生活如何。蓋一種細菌，其生活在試騐管中與在身體內，大相懸殊；故在試騐管中之淋菌生命，固極易澌滅，惟如在吾人體內，則用試騐之藥物，仍不能動其亳末，而一般目光短狹，經騐淺薄之流，便以爲在試騐管數小時可死之淋菌，則用之人身於三五日後，自可治愈。豈知大謬不然。蓋吾人生理，具有微妙不同之機能，不可與其他無機體之試騐管相比。故以一般之透膜殺菌之舊成分的療法，而欲在三五天內的短期中根治，無異緣木求魚。故以等此霸烈之治療法，當然不能完成短期治愈淋病的責任！</p>
<p>要根治淋病，並非一般口中嚷着三五天可愈之市上成藥所能奏功，據余本身所經騐，及集合世界各國淋病專家的意見，對德國淋病學家彼穗博士所發明之「克淋儂」，有一致的好評。對於初起白濁，二三星期可根治，其已轉入慢性者，四五星期無不斷根，此非余十數年來所得之統計指數，亦卽世界各國專家對「克淋儂」治淋上唯一有把握之短期療法，因「克淋儂」具有消炎噬菌之作用，所以能按步就班，將難於根治之淋菌，加以短期治愈。因大槪而言，三五星期根治白濁，是必須之歷程也。</p>

<h3>姚菊巖醫師述　診所：寗波路　九號四川路口</h3>
<p>對於白濁療法之商榷</p>
<p>徒然苦了　白濁患者</p>
<p>要根治一種難愈之病，當然不是空口喊出一種什麼新的療法，病就可以平空自好了。近來在淋病療法上，大有雨後春笋之盛。更奇者，一般市醫今日宣稱自己所用之治淋病方法，是最新而且是萬能的，到了明天，他們又換了一個新名稱，而詆責自己昨天所用之治淋爲落伍，陳舊；我想醫藥在今日雖說有一日千里之進步，但也恐怕沒有進步得這樣快吧！所苦者一般淋病患者，徘徊歧路，不知所措，徒然誤了病情，這豈不是那流眩奇耀能的市醫，給予可憐的淋病患者所致嗎？</p>
<p>除毒務盡　之根治法</p>
<p>吾人對於淋病之治療，總以實騐爲依歸，凡有實騐根治之療法，必有合於科學的準備繩，而合於科學準繩者，則並非今日有效而明日無效，所聞不廢江河萬古流者，正亦此意。余在臨床上將近二十年矣，每年新出世之療法，試用不可謂不週，而大多有名無實。在余近二十年的經過中，在電療方面，以德國靜電療法，殺菌力最優，若更輔用X線，則見效更好，一方內服舉世一致公認淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，促其體內細胞，發生抗淋噬菌，俾散蔓各處之淋菌，一鼓殲除之，故凡應用此等科學治療法，愈後無有重發之例。因本除毒務盡之意也。　診時上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診念號每號僅收號金五角。</p>
<h3>肺病健康法</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺病是一種最慢性的疾息。治時旣費悠長的歲月，叉需大量之金錢，故有人說肺癆病乃富貴病，就是說此病有錢人才够生此病的資格，無錢的人只有死路一條。那其實不然。不論任何肺病，以余歷年經騐所得，「補肺拿爾」一藥，確爲統治初二三期肺病之特效劑，因此劑功效之特點，厥爲補肺搜癆，而同時更具促進食慾。鎭咳去痰。不必假外科之手術，而能彌補肺郁空洞，歐美各大肺病療養院與專家，無不以此劑指示病家自宅服用。結果多獲圓滿功效。</p>

<h3>上海特輯　抗戰中之上海學校敎育　（續）</h3>
<p>— 崇淦</p>
<p>觀上表所列，則知戰後淪陷戰區者共有三五〇校之多，私立未立案及原址唱碟特區仍以迫於環境陷於停頓者亦尙未列入，而小學校經濟力量，又遠不若大學中學，故能遷至租界安全地帶復校者殊屬少數，但所設之小學，則如雨後春筍，較之大中學校，數量尤為可觀，據最近之調查統計，全市小學現有四〇三校，學生十一萬三千三百六十五人，較之戰前約減一七〇校，如以過去地域面簽學現有實況作比例，在量上言，不可謂少，然在質上言，則一部份學校，殊有亟速改善之必要也。</p>
<p>四·義務敎育</p>
<p>上海義務敎育，係遵照中央法令規定，自二十四年度開始實施，雖至抗戰開始時止，僅有兩年歷史。然而事業進行，已能組具規模。茲就二十五年度之各種設施，分別於後，以示一斑。</p>
<p>一·短期小學校—第一學期設二十四校，計三班者十七校，二班者七校，第二學期設二十六校，計三班者十九校，二班者七校。</p>
<p>二·短期小學班—第一學期設一百班，第二學期設一百十班。</p>
<p>三·增設初級小學—第一學期較二十四年度增四校，計兩學級者二校，單級者亦二校，第二學期可較第一學期增三校，計兩學級者二校，單級者一校。</p>
<p>四·擴充原校學級—第一學期較二十四年度增二十八級，第二學期又較第一學期增十八級。</p>
<p>五·推廣二部制學校—第一學期較二十四年度增四級，第二學期又較第一學期增四級。</p>
<p>六·實施巡迦敎育—特設眞蒲巡迦敎育實騐區，招收相當於短期小學三班之學生。</p>
<p>以上均為上海抗戰開始前二十五年度結束時之義務敎育設施，因此項事業，全由政府辦理，絕無私人出資興辦者。戰後因敎育行政機關結束，經費來源斷絕，維持諸感困難。且原有事業，十九散處四郊，欲圖恢復，更非易事。故目前除少數原址短期小學敎員苦心經營就安全地帶設法開學約有四十學級外，其餘事業，悉告停頓。復以經濟困難，復無自備校舍，而向各普通學校商請借用，其經常開支，亦不能不向學生酌收費用，以資挹注。較之戰前不收任何費用，供給課業用品者，殊有不同。所幸一切敎育設施，悉遵中央規定，為可慰耳。</p>
<p>五·結論</p>
<p>綜觀上海抗戰中之學校敎育，高等敎育，中等敎育，及初等敎育三方面，在數量上可謂有增無減，惟義務敎育，則未能遽復舊觀。但就質上言，尙待敎育人員之努力者綦多，謹就管見所及，略述於後。</p>
<p>一·今後各級學校之設立，應注重實科敎育，并適應本市環境之實際需要，以國防建設為最高原則。</p>
<p>二·校舍塲地，必須於可能範圍內力求擴充，務期於學生身心兩方，無碍其正常健康之發展。</p>
<p>三·師資設備，必須提高充實，務使每一銆，無論在學識上經騐上道德上，確能為學生之表率。設備則須審量經濟情形，多多購置，必要時并可各校合作辦理。</p>
<p>四·學生納費額，不能過於提高，值此兵燹之餘，民生凋疲，學生負擔增高，將有望門興嘆之虞，為敎育而敎育，應力挽商業化之積弊。</p>
<p>五·青年訓練，應力主嚴格，一反過去匯沓成風之弊，務使每一學生懍於抗戰時期所負使命之重大而知所努力。</p>
<p>六·未立案各學校，應於可能範圍內儘速完成立案手續，免致貽誤學生，阻止其發展前途。（完）</p>
<h3>游擊隊四處活躍　日軍狼狽不堪　日娼妓浪人與日軍偕行　到處欺詐取巧令人惱限</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（三十一日）據自京滬路一帶歸來之某華商談、娼妓浪人、欺詐取巧之輩、隨日軍而入中國內地、渠每抵一地、均爲日本士兵與浪人之侮辱及敲詐目的物、但華方游擊隊則常出襲擊、凡有一日兵之地、即有酒肆·舞塲·與妓院、蓋</p>
<p>娼妓與浪人</p>
<p>到處隨日軍而行、如蘇州即有許多妓院與舞塲、實則此兩者亦無大差別、日軍仍屠殺或虐待中國平民、而日機亦仍在其後方轟炸鄕村、日軍每聞何處游擊隊活躍、即不再調查、遽行派機轟炸該區、無論有無游擊隊，</p>
<p>鄉村被轟炸</p>
<p>者極多、兩週前曾有被炸傷之農民一人、自二十哩外之莘莊徒步入嘉興醫治、莘莊附近之游擊隊、使日軍惶惶不安者、巳達數星期、日軍怒調五百人、圖驅散游擊隊、時游擊隊駐於吳鎭、嘉興之游擊隊密探、已將日軍前侵之情報、</p>
<p>報吿游擊隊</p>
<p>預作準備、留駐若干士兵、引誘搭乘舢舨之日軍循吳鎮旁之河道上駛、愈行河道愈狹、至埋伏處、誘日軍登陸、自其後方襲擊之、日軍不備、紛紛奶入舢舨逃生、但因憧亂異常、致當塲格斃與受傷者極多、逃返嘉興者僅三百人、决日乃派飛機三架、往炸游擊隊、</p>
<p>但其所炸者</p>
<p>並非遊擊隊駐在地之吳鎭、而誤炸距該鎭十里外之莘莊、一星期後、嘉興傀儡報紙即載稱、日軍開赴莘莊與遊擊隊作戰、敵人傷亡甚多、並將遊擊隊擊散、日軍僅傷亡數名云云、該華商復稱、曾聞來往京滬綫之旅客談、遊擊隊</p>
<p>常出沒鐵路</p>
<p>附近、破壞鐵軌與橋樑、日軍無計可施、且疑遊擊隊化裝旅客、在各車站下車而行破壞工作、故每一車站、均有招貼、上繪車站上携帶包裹之商人等、下書乘火車者均須保護鐵路等字樣、日軍卽在公路上運輸或　動軍隊、亦無安全可言、沿較大之路　日軍築有無數堡壘與機關槍窟、而</p>
<p>在重要區域</p>
<p>則四週架置鐵絲網、遊擊隊有自河道而出擊者、日軍則在河邊架置兩重鐵絲網、邇來日有大批日商前往蘇州與嘉興、携帶絲織物藥品等貨、但大多數華人均不使用日本藥品與化妝品、日婦則爲化妝品之唯一顧客、</p>
<p>惟日貨布疋</p>
<p>則銷售頗廣、虹口楊　浦等區之日　浪人、亦大批隨日軍而行、肇禍生事、無所不爲、蓋彼等知無人敢訴諸日憲兵也、京滬間各淪陷城鎭鄉村、日方無充景兵力駐守之、故常爲遊擊隊之攻擊目的地、如距蘇州十五里之吳江、卽</p>
<p>旋大隊日軍</p>
<p>復往吳江、游擊隊則巳遠颺、故遊擊隊不斷襲擊、困擾日軍、日軍則與遊擊珍接戰、雙方俱有損失、然日軍之傷亡、軍火與銀錢之消耗、遠在遊擊隊之上、</p>

<h3>消滅中國蠶絲業之大陰謀</h3>
<p>— 吳馬</p>
<p>一、談往專和兩個前提</p>
<p>自從國軍西移以後，向被稱為中國蠶絲業重心的江浙一帶，相繼淪陷，當時因為時間的忽促，又因當局的準備沒有充分，許多該應遷移內地的蠶絲企業，都遺留在戰區。其中除掉絲廠工業以外，最足稱述的當然要算蠶種製造場。我們曉得：戰區中餘燼下的絲廠，在日人威脅與幾個絲業漢奸的謟媚之下，很多已在用著與「華中蠶絲公司合作」的名義，正式做著日人的經濟奴才；如無錫，蘇州，杭州等地的絲廠，現在雖在運轉中，但這不過是表示著日人的壓迫增高，榨取加深而已。許多漢奸敗類究竟得到了日人好處，無論是經濟方面，或是名節方面，恐怕誰也說不出，我們從無錫各絲廠在所謂「合作」之後的種種苛刻條件與痛苦的遭遇，更可明白。可是，過去一年中戰區中的蠶種界，一方面因為日人當時正在忙碌著，使「華中公司」攫奪戰區的絲廠，無暇顧到種場方面；一方面也因為製種界還沒有像無錫的張子珍，錢鳳高輩的敗類，雖然也有與偽政府中互通聲氣的人，但整個地說：還能保持中華民國蠶種製造場的尊嚴氣骨。這是一年來戰區蠶種界在這種苦難環境下忍辱奮鬥的評價！</p>
<p>可是淪陷區究竟是淪陷區，日人對中國整個的陰謀終究是兇狠惡毒的，而尤孝標（偽江蘇省政府建設廳第二科科長兼技正，兼蠶業取締所所長，實際上係偽蘇省政府蠶業行政之最高　威者）之流，也終不過是搖頭擺尾的漢奸，要想在淪陷區裏一本以往的方針繼續經營蠶種製造事業，或者要想在尤孝標之流的卵翼之下，維持蠶種製造場的地位，甚至藉機獲得些利益，都是夢囈。因為事業上：（一）覆巢之下無完卵，（二）奴才們也決無干預「主子」（？）和參加　議的與膽量，這是戰區蠶種業界應該充分認識清楚的兩個前提。</p>
<p>從而：我們進一步的來討論「華中蠶絲公司」最近的戰區蠶種製造業界的進攻：</p>
<p>二、五個滅亡的條件</p>
<p>在最近，「華中蠶絲公司」為實行統制戰區的蠶種業，以遂其攫取或是毀滅整個江浙的蠶絲業起見，已向素被稱為江浙牌子最老範圍最大的滸墅關大有蠶種製造場提出「合作」，這是日方對戰區種場的第一砲，無疑的是要推行到江浙戰區的全體種場，合作的條件是暫擬五條茲摘錄如下：</p>
<p>（一）原種向公司購買，不得復製或轉讓。</p>
<p>（二）由公司委派技術指導，場方支付薪給。</p>
<p>（三）毒率不得超過千分之三。</p>
<p>（四）製造之蠶種，由公司銷售，不得處行出售或轉讓他人。種款以交種時付一半，其餘春種於七月後，秋種於十月後付清。</p>
<p>（五）發出蠶種，成績不良時，由場方負責賠償。</p>
<p>五個條件之中，尤以第一條第四條和第五條為最狠毒，第二第三兩條，不過是這三條的輔助。茲再為分析於後：</p>
<p>關於第一條，實在包含著三個險惡的　義。第一：當然是統制戰區的蠶品種，使幾個較大的種場原來培育的優良品種趨於消滅，這樣一來，一方面各種場非與「華中蠶絲公司」合作，即無法獲得原種飼育，以製造普通蠶種。換言之：即唯日人是賴。那末，蠶絲業的存在與消滅，也可由日方原種的供給與否，而完全操於日人之手了。第二：日本自從戰爭以來，即限制羊毛輸入，但因為日本羊毛生產的貧瘠，不得不另謀補救方法；於是有所謂藺質羊毛即以藺經化學品處理後，使近似羊毛之一種纖維之提倡。但又因充作藺質羊毛之原料藺：不但不必如製絲原料藺般之優良，且反以不堪製絲之綿藺為適用；故在國內提倡飼育之後，即遭製絲業界之劇烈反對，理由為此種下等原料藺一提倡，對於充作製絲用之優良藺的生產，勢必大受影響也。所以日人如果統制江浙戰區的原種，使各種　都購買他們的產品，當然可乘機將此類品種輸入戰區，一則可使戰區中的國人代他們生產原料，以遂其榨取的目的，再則更可緩和國內製絲業界的反對，第三是日人素視中國為其蠶絲敵國，因為中國土地廣漠，人力豐富，蠶絲業尚有偉大的發展可能，日本則適得其反。正唯其如此，對日本的蠶絲王國的威脅也最大，所以日本政府在中國蠶絲業主要地帶的江浙失陷之後，就一而再，再而三的派遣國內蠶絲學界的權威，如東高蠶的木暮，福本，上田的林貞三等，先後來調查視察，以冀獲得一個整個的對華蠶絲方策。當時，日本的論調有整個消滅與開發的二種。可是，現在日人的陰謀，卻是採用了開發的消滅。就是在江浙等戰區，行統制的開發；除掉日人之外，華方無對其他外國的發生買賣關係；使華絲在世界消費市場的地位，歸於消滅，這樣：既無虞於華絲與日絲的競爭，又可獲得戰區中蠶絲業的寶藏。戰區中的原種一統制，當然這個目的不難達到。最淺顯的例，就是如果把不堪製絲的蠶品種推行到戰區，則上海的絲廠和戰區的小絲廠，就無法也不屑收取戰區中生產的原料藺，因為這種藺子巳不是製絲所需的原料了。這就是日人大聲痴呼的所謂「樹立百年大計」的百年大計呀！亦即是日政府所謂「經濟合作」的面目！</p>
<p>關於第二條：蠶種場不但是半空飼養了一個日本人，多增加一部分經濟的負擔；而且正和元朝時的所謂「十家三韃子」一樣，這個日本人，還具備著主管蠶種場和監視華人行動的權力，簡直是蠶種場的「太上皇」。</p>
<p>第三條的限制，實際上就是使種場不得不聘請日人的一個圈套，同時日本的普通蠶種也得有一個來華傾銷的機會。因為過去的毒率規定：是百分之二〇時焚毀，百分之三時再檢；現在毒率不得超過千分之三，一方面要使種場膽寒，覺得非請日本的技師不可，一方面毒率檢查程度提高，可使戰區中普通蠶種的及格數量減少，於是生產量也隨而減少；使得日本的普通蠶種，可以運到戰區中來，換取中國的金錢。而保證日本的原料政策的不致因蠶作不豐而致落空，猶其餘事也。</p>
<p>第四條統制蠶種的產銷，把扼住蠶種的經濟，使得各種場部變成華中蠶絲公司的一部生產機器——不，機器還得花金錢購買，非有巨大的資本投入不可；這簡直是中古時代的農奴，除掉拚命的和「主子」做掙錢的生產工作以外，「主子」要給你飯吃就得吃飯，「主子」要給你粥喝就得喝粥，而不得不唯「主子」的「華中蠶絲公司」是賴。因為產銷一得編製之後，種場與農民間的關係完全消滅，蠶種場僅對「華中蠶絲公司」發生關係，這不　是種價多少和「華中公司」應否給種場以代價等，都得由「公司」來隨便決定；而且「華中公司」可以拿蠶種直接換取農民的法幣，以軍用票或是偽幣給種場。如此一來，蠶種場還不是日人的附庸？</p>
<p>關於第五條：　視似乎與農民有利，但什麼都在日人掌握中的時候，蠶種場已僅對「華中蠶絲公司」方面負責任，故所謂賠償也者，照手續上講：當然是先由蠶種場賠償「華中蠶絲公司」，再由「華中蠶絲公司」賠償給農民，這樣：一期蠶訊結束後，「華中蠶絲公司」要付給種場的種價倒可拿成績不良來作幌子，以作賴掉一半種價的理由；甚至還可勒令種場加倍賠償損失；至於處在「日偽」淫威之下的農民，原來是看到日人連躲避奔逃都來不及，誰敢因為蠶作不豐而反去找尋日本人？就使是退一萬步講：日本人真正是有心賠償農民損失的話。</p>
<p>總之：條件雖然僅僅是五條，已是十足道地的毒辣凶狠，足使中國原有的一點蠶絲基礎，摧毀無遺。戰區蠶種場的經營者如果還有一點人心，如果還能把眼光放遠大些的話，應該斷然的拒絕。</p>
<p>三、今後的兩條路綫</p>
<p>聽說大有蠶種場在獲得這種優越的合作條件之後，當時並沒有毅然的接受；而準備用吳縣蠶種業同業公會的名義，呈請偽江蘇省政府，建設廳，表示反對。種場的不贊成與日方合作，當然是可喜的現象；但僅僅是請求偽政府援助，我們不管這種方法應用得得當與否，單就效果方面而言，也是絕對不夠的。因為漢奸們服從「他們主子」之不暇，那裏還再敢進什麼意見？這種認識上的錯誤，在全民族總動員的全面抗戰的現在，似乎太不應該！然則，在這種惡辣的壓束之下，各種場應該如何對付？這我可以說除掉絕對的不合作主義外，無他途。但這裏的所謂不合作主義，卻並不是消極的把蠶種場停辦，就算完事，因為這樣一來，兇惡的日人正會利用估價的方法來把你的蠶室蠶具桑園等等，作為間定資本，由他們來接辦，如此不更中了他們的毒計？故為今之計，處在戰區裏種蠶種製造場，正唯有積極的採取遙往遊擊隊勢力區域與後方的兩條路綫，前者是把可以移動的東西儘景地儘遠地向游擊隊控制勢力的區域中搬運，以備在游擊隊區域進行裝種事業的張本，同時將無法搬運的東西如蠶室附蜀室等等，加以全部或局部的摧毀，以斷絕日人覬覦之心。我們曉得，日人在戰區中除掉勉强維持幾條交通線，以及較大的城市以外，其他廣漠的鄉村，俱在中國游擊隊控制勢力下，所以種場只要能舍得眼前的一點設備，搬到游擊隊區域中去經營是毫無問題的。而且對於幾個深得農民信仰的種場蠶種，如滸蠶關大有種場的虎牌蠶種，壬戌館的三角牌蠶種，無錫三五館的三葫蘆牌蠶種，等等。仍能在戰區的農民羣中維持著固有地位，不致消滅。即將來驅走日人之後，就是拓展的絕好根基也。</p>
<p>後者是將值得（請注意值得二字）移動的東西，盡量地儘速地向後方如雲，桂，四川等省搬運，以備與政府合作來開發西南的蠶絲業。同時將蠶室等等，實行焚燬，俾免被日人利用。因為在政府方面，已是幾經聲明，對於民間的資本和技術，都是非常需要，而且這個時機，也正是全國民眾共盡匹夫之責的時候，各種的生產企業理應跟隨政府西移，除掉直接乾著游擊隊工作的人以及間接的搗亂日人統制的事業以外，原沒有理由可以居住在淪陷區域。現在，又適逢淪陷區域的不許茍延殘喘，那末除掉向游擊隊勢力區域移動之外，毫無疑義的是只有加入後方的蠶絲生產陣營，好在以江浙蠶種業者過去的經騐，無論是經營方面，或是技術方面，足夠到一個蠶絲業荒蕪的區域中去做拓荒工作，何況還有政府輔助吧。</p>
<p>（我覺得有些規模較大的種場，其力量足夠兩條路綫同時并進。）</p>
<p>總之，使能堅決地採用此兩條路綫，以作目下日人壓迫勢力下的緊急對策的話，則失之束隅，尚能收之桑榆。如果喪心病狂，俯首貼耳地甘願在日人「合作」之名下為經濟的奴才，蹈無錫等絲廠業的覆轍，則不特蠶種場經營者個人聲敗名裂，成為蠶絲業界之敗類；亦且係中華民族之罪人！為功為非，俱在此一轉瞬間。在這個日人正向戰區蠶種製造場開始進攻，而蠶種場本身還沒有背叛中國，甘愿為日人之附庸的當兒，敬以所知，披諸報諯，藉以揭發日人對戰區蠶種業之陰謀，並促蠶種業界之急速而深切的覺悟！</p>

<h3>金融　英純金續高昂　飾金仍懸原價</h3>
<p>現金烚赤暗盤昨因星期例假、故聞一無做開、售價仍為二千〇二十元光景、與上日相仿、</p>
<p>銀首飾金、每兩兌出亦等仍懸原價二百〇五元、新同行懸二百〇三元、收進一百九十七元、</p>
<p>二十一日倫敦電、英純金因受英鎊軟化影響、致每盎斯昇一辦士半、計達七鎊八先令八辦士半、</p>

<p>二十一倫敦電、銀市印度及投機家買進、出者觀望、然市況尚形穩平、大條銀近遠期俱長一二五、又紐約電、美銀價依然有行無市、又孟買電、印銀市況半靜、現貨續長一安那、近遠期則均未更、</p>
<h3>糧食　變元終以存貨稀價加一角</h3>
<p>昨日國米來源共到河下貨十二號、車輪包子六七千包、本街及囤戶去路俱屬不暢、惟售方因見天時陰雨、似有怍雪之象、心思殊堅、故成交有限、厚薄粳行情略好幾分、杜洋尖埠尖情形與前相仿、變元則去路活潑、而乏貨供應、形勢復俏、價增一角、</p>

<h3>煤炭　舟山炭罊　大批裝到</h3>
<p>家常日用之手定罊宿、入冬銷路增加、本埠作場、限於溫州炭層斷檔、無法出貨、以致市面求過於供、價格步漲、日前某號向舟山方面、託帆船裝來炭罊三十幾萬、業已到埠、向同業兜銷、分大中小三號、大號每千十五元、中號十三元、小號十一元、同行批發送到另加車力、</p>
<h3>海味　西洋海參銷路旺</h3>
<p>西洋海參、邇來銷路頗佳、致此間存貨愈薄、號盤趨緊、如昨日開出計揀條玉為一百三十三元、出辦一百二十元、一號玉一百二十六元、二號玉一百十八元、三號玉一百十元、四號玉九十九元、五號八十九元、又赤參出辦一號一百四十元、二號一百三十一元、正三號一百二十元、三號一百〇四元、四號十九元、五號七十七元、查玉參中檔如三四五號各升十元、赤參以前漲起十餘元、</p>
<h3>五金　本元釘跌進十六元</h3>
<p>本廠元釘、在五金各花色中、可稱為最普通花色、因用度較廣、故市價之跌、頗有出入、此貨最近巳打破十六元關口、而回至十五元七角半、昨成交五六百桶、由客幫及建築幫辦去、據最近廠方情形、異常軟弱、對於大宗交易、均願意拋售、所以內盤頗為萎靡、惟實交無多、市情益難進展、查門市散戶、昨亦銷去五六十桶、但售盤則在十六元左右云、</p>
<h3>藥材　杭白菊到貨少</h3>
<p>杭白菊既為藥材、又名茶菊、如吾人常飲之綠茶、參以菊花、清香味和、堪稱雋品、故銷路亦夥、聞前批到過六七十件、為包子蒸花（每裝一市斤）、巳由茶葉幫辦去、成盛為七十五元、惟來源稀少、兼之外費繁車、成本加昂、近日市售八十元、勢頗俏利、</p>

<h3>來函　一位洋銀行華職員的聲明</h3>
<p>啟者：昨讀貴報商業新聞欄內銀錢業皆大發財一節內，載「在洋銀行行員，月月有盈餘，有外匯可派，棄了洋　福；其實還是　政府福故無一不笑逐顏開」。云云。其實洋銀行職員寃哉枉也，貴報對於洋銀行情形未免失於明瞭之處，特請更正之以供眾覽，庶幾不失真相也。查洋行中，西籍行員確乎薪給優厚，大概普通職員，年入有二萬元之　；其中名目繁多，如養老金，汽車費，醫藥費，租屋費，外匯貼補費，若華藉行員中薪給最高者，月入僅二百元，年終花紅，僅加薪一月而已！月遭買辦無理剝削；如某大洋銀行買辦龍某月薪三千元，向各職員薪金上尅扣者七八千元，故其每年收入不下十萬元，席豐頗厚，侍從獲衛者六七名，今年購買外匯，鎊價飛漲，　　三百萬元，大發其國難財，然而鄙吝成性，對於難民救濟及國難獻金，竞一毛不拔；即親友借貸，亦竟一錢不名，（中略）顧普通之洋銀行華職員，生活煎迫，牛馬奔走，受其壓迫，敢怒而不敢言，豈得謂笑逐顏開耶！此請著安，夏怡生手啟　元月二十一日</p>
<p>自「銀錢萊皆大發財」一稿發表後，頗接著許多電話函件，請本報多多注意此種消息，但為篇幅所限，日常新聞，尚難全行發表，勢難多所刊載，前日接夏君來函聲明，洋行華職員並未皆「笑逐顏開」，亦多是牛馬奔走，請予更正，自應發表以符慣例，至此外如有新穎緊要函稿，得荷惠告中，仍當擇要披露，以盡天職。　編者</p>

<h3>史高托杯　麗都獲賽權　六比二大勝臘克斯　上半時二比零佔先</h3>
<p>昨晨陰　罩、下午突然開朗、史高托盃二决賽遂順　宣吿結束，麗都與臘克斯會師於膠州公園、塲地異常濘瀾、觀衆則三倍於上午逸園、麗都以丙組之資格、竟將甲組雄師臘克斯、以六比二之鉅數淘汰、得史盃複賽權以歸、上半時麗都以　比零佔先、現獲得複賽權者爲麗都、西捕、聖芳濟、及東塞萊四隊、好自爲之、本屆史盃盟主、有厚望焉、</p>
<p>先聲奪人　二球佔先</p>
<p>麗都逆風爲陣、撥球先攻、法凡笑大舉深入、陸鐘恩眼快手快、踢出險境、此後局勢、遂盡入麗都掌握、法凡笑經楊金陵嚴密監觀、毫無動彈餘地、　見麗都、轟活躍、不久張林根偶一失脚、麥克登如飛而下、近門拉射、咸謂必中、不意竟然偏出、十八分鐘時、孫錦順傳江潮、江潮切中、李義臣於十二碼處、低射中右角、紀錄遂開、臘隊努力反攻、培格於弱球區外、執罰任意球、陸鍾恩用拳敲出、勃利寗近門力射、陸鍾恩竟然夾住、無不稱慶、廿五分鐘時、張銘生射門、阿脫克拉斯臥地一擋、僅　球皮、曹秋亭趕上一脚、正中網心、二比〇、相隔四分鐘、孟義良犯規被罰十二碼、培格主踢、竟然斜飛、臘隊士氣、更見頹唐、休息笛聲旣起、麗都凈勝兩球、</p>
<p>緊張局勢　中獲大勝</p>
<p>樣以後、臘隊大易位置、馬達調充左衛、法凡笑遞補右鋒、雪尼淸谷踢冀、格林勃調任前衛、果然生氣勃勃、二分鐘時、勃利寗頭攻、法凡笑一脚中的、扳成二比一、方期更上一層、不圖七分鐘時、格林勃在禁區拉人被罰十二碼、孫鐵腿主踢、竟被撲出、幸曹秋亭一脚勾中、阿脫格拉司尙未起身、孫錦順巳連球帶人、滾進綱內、三比一麗都仍先二球、臘隊冉接再厲、十六分鐘時、終爲臘隊於二十碼處獲一任意球機會、法凡笑踢出中木彈回、勃利寗加上一脚、遂吿不救、三比二此數、旣告接近、李義臣又受傷、不良於行、局勢頗感危殆、相持至卅四分鐘、張銘生傳石永楠，擺渡中央、李義臣於十碼處低射、四對二局勢遂告穩定、再越五分鐘、李義臣故意失脚、江潮一撥敵門又破、五比二勝算已穩、最後一分鐘、曹秋亭傳中、張銘生竄入低射、六對二錦上添花、終塲笛聲隨起、臘克斯慘被淘汰麗都獲複賽權、</p>
<h3>球運不通良機成書餅　東華昨竟遭慘敗　二比四被挫於東塞萊　史高托盃須再待來年</h3>
<p>昨晨細雨如絲、逸園東華與東塞萊之史考托盃第二週賽、仍照常舉行觀衆僅到三四百人、而東華球運亦與天時同一慘淡、於泥濘球重之兩重壓迫下、以二比四慘被英軍淘汰、上半時連失三球、實爲致命之傷、</p>
<p>連失三球　士氣遂喪</p>
<p>中綫開球、　五分鐘、潘傑脫一脚高球、直抵門下、周達雲雙手拍出、麥克洛堆斜裹穿上、舉中的、東華先失一城、於是三軍用命、奮力反攻、戴萬吳直趨前綫、阿戴覩機左傳、阿萬拉射、竟越橫木飛去、彌覺可惜、此後英軍勢甚猖獗、十五分鐘、麥克洛脫舉足　關、達雲用脚一擋、不圖以矛授人、鮑獨克人到脚到、大門又見洞開、二比〇、戴萬吳三角傳遞、反攻敵巢、阿戴頭頂、炳浩　進、赫斯脫滑仆在地、不意良　又失、球運不通、炳浩拉射、竟中權木、未幾、幼良開出角球、阿戴頭攻、又高越橫本、其後幼良盤過奧斯汀及海列遜二關、輸送中央、英軍前無援兵後又空虛、不料戴吳彼此、雙雙失脚、又成畫餅於是三十六分鐘時、茀拉台於二十碼處、猛攻達雲之右角、低而且急、上半時英軍遂以三比〇佔絕對優勢、</p>
<p>球運之壞　一至於此</p>
<p>樣以後、東華大調位置，莊趙互易、徐蔡亦相換、形勢驟見好轉、雖一分鐘內、先遇一險、但此後攻勢頗盛、阿戴于二十四碼處、先施遠射、球平而急、射的過準、竟直中赫斯脫之懷抱、未幾球從右邊進展、海列遜失脚、門戶洞開、戴沈並肩直下、可惜父射偏一尺、事有更可惜於此者當幼良一脚傳出、沈土彥飛步趕着、于底錢勾中、球沿門前掠過、阿戴炳浩雙騎衝進、人入網而球則滾出界外、惠　一碰，幾乎倒戈、但成角球、鏖戰復鏖戰、英軍頗見竭獗、前綫僅海爾於二十五碼處施一遠射、中柱彈回、後方仍風鶴頻驚、赫斯脫持球行走四步、被罰撿籬笆、離門僅二碼、結果一齊倒地、球則未進、大有橄欖球風味、東華在此總攻下、終於二十九分鐘時。由幼良切中、炳浩頭傳阿戴、於十四碼處碰然中的、扳成一對三、象華更與炳浩易位、於四十三分鐘時、士彥傳賈、阿賈傳萬、阿萬回傳承動、　送門前、沈士彥一撥中的、二比三僅負一球矣、惜離終塲僅兩分鐘、而茀拉台突然於十八碼處、脚遠射、達云膛目未接、東　好夢未圓、以二對四慘被淘汰於　盃第二週、</p>

<p>某君來此間談，問起我：「敵人的馬被我軍截獲的時候，就低下頭去表示慚愧懺悔的樣子，可有這回事？」我抱愧得很，不但沒有看見過，簡直沒有聽到過。我把許多我方將領騎在俘獲的敵馬上的照片給他看，那昂然的樣子，好像並沒有懺悔的表示。不過能找一匹從戰塲過來一心耍出家的敵馬看看，也頗爲有趣，可惜我們無此眼福。</p>
<p>由於某君提起敵馬的話題，許多在戰塲上過活的朋友都說起他們自己的見聞來。「在蘭陵附近的一個寨子裏，一中隊敵方的騎兵給我軍包圍住了，到了第三天，在一個堅靱的鐵箍中，顯然沒有突破的希望了。第四天的早晨，有一架敵機就在那寨子上低飛，投下一個信號，敵機飛回去以後那一小時，寨子裹有一陣斷續的槍聲，接着又寂然無聲了。不久那寨子就給我軍打開了，那寨子裏　着叫十多個敵兵，還有五十多匹敵馬：那些馬，有的只剩一隻耳朵，有的只剩一隻眼睛，淋着鮮血站在那兒。其中有幾匹眞正成爲獨眼龍的，到現在還在我們的馬羣裹拖車。敵人的馬，樣子倒是很不錯的，胖胖的，毛色很光鮮。</p>
<p>參謀長追述在魯南親見的那一回事，觸起了　軍事長的新話題，他說：「敵人的馬，太漂亮了的也眞沒有辦法，一零六師團送給我們的那些馬，足够編成一個騎兵中隊，其中有十幾匹頂漂亮的，據說是一種名貴的馬種，連草料都得從他們自己國內帶來的。我們養不起這些少爺馬，抬又抬不動，只好讓牠餓死在那裏。」某君笑道：「敵人的藝術家，也許可以畫成一幅義馬圖，說那些馬中的少爺被俘不屈，絕食而死。」我在哄堂大笑之後，補叙「未死的兵」中，敵人對自己馬匹所批評的話，他們自己說：「中國的騾馬，看是那個鬼樣子，叉瘦又小，一步拖一步的；一到走起遠路來，尤其在泥濘崎嶇的長途上，我們的看是頂出色的馬匹，大不如那些鬼樣子的騾馬，耐苦耐走，不會倒下去。」這倒是中日兩國戰事前途命運的總說明了敵人的馬，象徵了敵人的作戰力。</p>
<p>參謀在蘭封作戰時，出入於著名遊竄的土肥原所指揮的騎兵縱隊中十多天，先先後後截獲了許多馬匹，他自己所騎的馬和　軍長所騎的都還是那回奪來的。他的「敵馬論」也頗爲有趣，他說：「主人的性格常會從他所愛好的對象表現出來；小姐們歡喜巴兒狗，大盜要帶一隻猙獰向人的狼式的狗，這都是主人性格的反映。敵人對於馬匹有一種普遍的心念，這是「　軍」的馬，要胖要光鮮，內裹結實不結實可不大注意。我們閒常時候，也把敵馬當作裝飾品：一上戰塲，我可要另外選擇一下了。」用馬匹的形態來刻劃暴發戶的心理，從深處想，倒是很雋永的。</p>
<p>在日本方面，也未始沒有人看到這一點；那被犧牲於二二五事件的高橋藏相，不是會說到他們自己經濟根柢上的空虛嗎？</p>
<h3>達拉第：『祇剩我自己的一份了』</h3>
<p>— 戴蒼奇</p>
<h3>懺悔</h3>
<p>— 魯鳴</p>
<p>半夜裏，被窗外的雨聲　醒了轉來，我記起了敏。敏在今天的黃昏，被我從這逐出去了。</p>
<p>敏是我的朋友，也是同室士和英的朋友。道一個每邊不足五尺的斗室，我們三個人住着，巳嫌狹窄，敏　也硬要在這裹住下。起初僅說三四天馬上就走，我們以情面難却，勉强應允了。雖然我們三人都在風雨飄搖中生活，勞力所得，祇够艱苦的苟延，而敏則比我們更苦：他有了手無法勞動。此時，他祇得從窮朋友的碗中，分杯羹。</p>
<p>「同病相憐，」這「憐」是出於情感的，因憐而發出賜與，也是些微而一時的。敏長久的要我們緊縮了褲帶養他，這自然是不可能的了！</p>
<p>幾次我們的用溫和的態度對他解說我們的苦衷，室小力微，望他從速另籌別法，他聽了總像忘了。一天天捱過去，逐漸，我們開始對他有了憎厭和煩惡。</p>
<p>一個月過了又一個月，現在快二個月了，我們把錢都化在吃到肚內去的東西上，房租積欠了兩個爲，種種痛苦，我們認爲都是敏一個人作的孽，要沒有他，我們何至於這樣！於是，今晚，我們都發怒了：</p>
<p>「趕走敵敏！」</p>
<p>當敏徒老虎泡水回來預水回來預備煮晚餐的時候，我照着剛才的决議，第一偭開口了了：</p>
<p>「敏，夜飯不用煮，你得趕快離開這裏！」</p>
<p>我這突發的嚴肅的銅鐵樣斬截的話語，　敏驚愕得呆住了，兩眼瞪視着我，說不出一句話」趕快走　」一我重又命令着：「你再獃下去，非但害我們沒得吃，連屋也沒得住了！你明白嗎？明白的趕快離開這裏！」</p>
<p>他　的一聲　着面哭了，像一隻迷途的羔羊般可憐！但這非但沒有引起我的哀憐心，反燃燒起我的怒燄！我大聲的</p>
<p>一滾！你！不吉利的鄙夫！</p>
<p>說着我站起來把他推出門去。他一面掙扎，一面帶着淚顫聲的嚷道：「呌我到什麼地方去呀！呌我到什麼地方去呀，」「到你有錢的朋友處去！……」我切齒厲聲的回答他。</p>
<p>「我，我那裏有……有錢的朋友呀！有錢的，以前是我的朋友！現在，現在他們那裹肯收留我！沒錢的窮朋友還念交情混在一塊……」</p>
<p>「哼！窮朋友如何招待得起，自己也速累死哩！滾，非滾不……門推到</p>
<p>屋外。此刻掙扎得瘋在：「雲，雲呀，你念念舊情，我不吃你們—的飯，讓，讓我在門角佔一隻舖　吧……</p>
<p>「碰！」我把門關上了，隨他在門外搶地呼天的哭呌，用拳頭擂着門，都裝作不聞不見</p>
<p>敏的哭呌聲　乾啞而微弱來，不知在什麼時候靜寂了下</p>
<p>可是此刻，老天竟下起雨來了，更是傾盆的大雨！我被驚醒了，我不能不記起敏！　敏是被我趕走的，使他露宿在雨中，是我的罪啊！我悔了！</p>
<p>我披衣起床，寒冬的午夜，冷氣使我索索顫慄！點上煤油燈，熒熒的火芒略夜驅去了網的黑暗！我側耳靜聽，「可噹蟋蟀，」彷彿是敏回我復仇的呼聲；再注視壁上玻窗，雨脚像株株　箭，直射向仇人的心窩！不容我再有猶疑，我一手提燈，一手開了室門，又開了屋門，我要讓敏走進我們這溫暖的小室來。我願跪在地上請求他給我責罰！</p>
<p>冷雨射上我的頭臉身手，那裹有敏的影兒？</p>
<p>敏啊，敏啊！你道時躲在人家的屋檐下，變成了落湯鷄，抑是已僵斃在陣雨中？</p>
<p>敏啊！你的朋友雲深深地懺悔了！室雖小尙可容得下你這人，餓死也要在一起啊！歸來，歸來，重回進你窮朋友的家中，一起來奮鬥掙扎吧……</p>
<h3>眼睛的使命</h3>
<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>寫文章：用腦子，用手，還得用眼睛。</p>
<p>不用眼睛寫出來的東西，只能自己寫自己看，沒有一個　者會要　。文章結構好，字句也美麗有力，可是滿紙空話，看了亳無所得，還是閉目高臥來得有益、學學國文嗎？誰有功夫來揣摩學習呢？</p>
<p>社會是多面的，人間的現象變化也是深莫可測；你看到了一些，我也看到一些：擬體驗到了一些，我也體驗到一些：咳嗽你看到或體驗到的，幷不見得就是我看到或體驗到的、我們有把自己了解深知，甚至於領悟感受的材料刻劃出來。用腦子想，用手寫：可是先還要用眼睛看。</p>
<p>看又怎樣看法呢？身邊瑣事和四周狀况有時不能滿足我們筆桿的需耍；我們覺得生活太平凡了，沒有一點材料可以着筆，也沒有値得發表的生活記錄。所以，有人喊了：「題材荒　」雖然有人指示，有人告訴我們說寫作的題材永遠用不完，也有人敎我們如何利用小原料，如何去發掘寫作題材，但是，依舊有人喊：「題材荒！」好像能着筆的材料都被別人用完了。</p>
<p>其實，只要會得看，就可創造出無限的好文章。允其是今日這個史詩時代，每一個角落裏都能够找出不少精彩的素材，經過思想的鍛鍊，筆的渲染，便可以完成文人的大使命。不過，說來容易，做起來可就難了。人人都眼高手低，會說不會做。這是事實，我不否認：然而我不相信夢得生花之筆的奇事和倚馬可待的怪天才。一件事，一個人，或者一羣人，一羣東西，都應該用自己的肉眼去看，看到了還不能就在紙上塗劃起來，還得用腦子把肉眼的戚覺消化一下，用自己的主觀立塲細細明嚼，等到辨出味道，再在筆下化功夫，就有希望吿成大功了。</p>
<p>文壇上有不少文字騙子，把自己一知半解的東西，大吹大擂的用來號召；結果也許會騙到名譽，騙到地位，甚至於騙到金錢。而其實呢，充其量亦不過是一個聰明的騙子而已：拆穿了更不値錢，人人都會啞然失笑。</p>
<p>我們有眼睛，有能够看東西的眼睛。就應該好好用牠，不辜負牠的使命，讓　替我們解决「題材荒」的當前的大難題。</p>
<h3>胡少保平倭戰功</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>明季周淸原的「西湖二集」最後一卷即卷之三十四就是「胡少保「倭戰功」，並附「要緊海防」的方法於後，大的有深意存在裹面吧？吾則爲什麼要把平倭的故事作爲壓卷，並且再三的把防倭的方法告訴讀者呢？</p>
<p>這一回短篇小說大部分是根據明茅坤的「紀剿除徐海本末」，好些地方只是文言改爲白話，並稍加描寫罷了。</p>
<p>其中有一節王翠翹的故事，寫妓女誘徐海投降，害死徐海，頗爲動人：其行爲有類於明末的費宮人。崑曲「刺虎」旣是舞臺上常演的名劇，王翠翹該也是極好的戲劇題材了。</p>
<p>關於王翠翹，明佚名的「嘉靖東南平倭通錄」，簡直不曾提起，明朱九德的「倭變事略」也只有這樣幾句：「嘉靖三十五年，八月十九日，海知危在旦夕，漏二鼓，遣親密護送二愛姬出巢逃遁。」所謂二愛姬，就是王翠翹和綠姝。</p>
<p>王　翹的本事如下：『王翠翹，臨淄妓也。倭寇江南，掠翠翹法，寨主徐海絕愛幸之，尊爲夫人。凡一切計畫，惟翹指使。乃翹亦陽　之，實陰幸其敗事。會督府遺華老人招海降，海將殺之，翹解其縛而贈之金。歸告督府，乃更遺羅中軍詣海說，而益市金珠寶玉以陰賄翹。翹日在帳中從容言大事必不可成，不如降也。海計遂决。督府大整兵，佯稱逆降：迫海寨，海信翹言不爲備，官兵突入，斬海首，而生致翹，倭人殲焉。督府以翹賜永順酋長，翹去，渡錢塘歎曰：「明山遇我厚，我以國事誘殺之：殺一酋更屬一酋，何面目生乎？」夜半投江死。』（節茅坤紀戰除徐海本末）</p>
<p>歐陽予倩想將此事編爲新皮黃，以他寫「梁紅玉」的技巧，來寫王翠翹離　葉麻陳東，必有一番雋言妙語；惟本事中「市金珠寶玉以陰賄翹，」（嵇翥靑「中日歷代戰史」向三二六也說：「數遺諜持簪珥璣翠遺海兩侍女，日夜說海。」）未免降低了王翠翹的身分和志願。照上下文看來，則王翠翹前旣「陽諾之，實陰幸其敗事，」後又自言「以國事誘殺之，」可見在未受賄前，其志早决，並且明言是爲了國事，　是金珠寶玉所能說動的呢？我希望將來予倩寫此劇時，能够强調王　翹爲國事殺徐海這一點。</p>
<p>徐海本是華人，助紂爲虐，這使我們想起八一三滬戰時，我國石洞口的漁夫，領導敵人深入，以致失去了羅店；蘇南亦因漁夫做了漢奸，以致蘇州無錫江陰一帶，很快的失去。以今證古，如出一轍。予倩在「梁紅玉」中旣已活畫出王智來，那末像徐海那樣的大漢奸，一定也能够給我們一張「謔畫」的。</p>

<h3>救濟丐童</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>近來上海各處，都可以看見做乞丐的兒童。</p>
<p>有的丐童在馬路邊上，追着行人要錢。有的丐童坐在地上，向過路的人要錢。有的丐童，在電車，公共汽車的站台上，向候車人要錢。有的丐童，在小菜塲四週，揀拾菜皮，肉骨。倘若賣菜人或買菜人不留意，這些丐童，也會做「順手牽羊」的玩意，偷一點小菜，藏在自己破籃子裏。</p>
<p>有的丐童，在荒地上，或垃圾箱裏，翻找破爛的東西，如煤渣，柴片，紙片，布片，香煙罐頭，破瓶，碎玻璃之類，凡是人家拋棄的廢物，他都一一揀拾起來，送到舊貨店裹，換幾個銅元。</p>
<p>上海丐童爲什麼這樣多？大的可分兩類：一類是由內地避居上海的難民，無以爲生，便逼着自己的孩子，同做乞丐。這類丐童，是幫助父母，共同維持家庭生活的。還有一類，是由「老頭子」（老乞丐）傳授行乞的技術，向路人耍錢。要到的錢，令數交給老頭子。老頭子專做倒飯桶的工作，將菜館裹吃剩下來的飯菜，倒下來，分給「徒弟」（丐童）吃。到了晚上，老頭子照應徒弟睡在齷齪的弄堂裏。這類丐童，是幫助老乞丐要錢的。如要不到錢，往往還要挨打，有時竟被打成殘廢呢！</p>
<p>這些丐童簡直比奴隸還不如！據說上海的丐童，的有一兩千人，他們唯一的出路，不是　三就是盜匪。我們站在人道方面，或是站在社會方面，對於丐童，應該急須加以救濟，予以敎餐。</p>
<p>救濟的方法不外設立丐童敎養院：茲擬簡單的辦法如下，</p>
<p>一、院址：選擇靠近貧苦居民的地方，建築幾十間棚屋，將全市丐童，强迫住到裏面，除供給衣食外，施以感化敎育幷予以相當的知識，和謀生的技能。</p>
<p>二、經費：假定以兩千丐童計算，開辦費除外，每月經常費約需萬元。上海不乏樂善好施的同胞，我想這個很少的數目，是不難籌到的。</p>
<p>丐童也是國家未來的主人翁，我們救濟丐童，也就是改良社會，振興國家。希望全市同胞，急起組織，促其實現。</p>
<p>民間故事</p>
<h3>王四相公</h3>
<p>— 鳳吾</p>
<p>話說明朝末年，流寇為患，李自成政陷北京，崇禎帝自縊煤山而死，山海關總兵吳三桂因愛妾陳圓圓被李自成所刦，衝冠一恕，竟不惜借滿兵入關。於是引狼入室，錦繡山河，遂被異族盤踞，多爾袞入關後四十日間，即迎順治入主北京，同時父派兵南下。一時大小官吏，逃走的逃走，投降的投降，一班無恥漢奸，更是稱臣道帝，認賊作父起來了。可是始終不屈不撓的也就不少。最著者有史忠烈公的與揚州共存亡，江陰閻典史的死守孤城，烈烈轟轟的壯蹟，其人其事，足傳千古。</p>
<p>却說淸兵相繼攻下揚州江陰以後，浩浩蕩蕩直奔浙江而來，勢如破竹，很容易過了平湖縣城。便委了一個跳樑小醜，粉墨登塲，扮演平湖知縣。那一日知縣上任，一路鳴　喝道，招搖過市。可是人心不死，那翎頂揮煌的怪模樣，個個人咬牙切齒，恨不得一口把他吞下去。這時候有一個姓李的鐵匠，正在打鐵，看了這狐假虎威，威風凜凜的光景，氣得兩眼發瞪，竟順手拾起一把大剪刀來，望那知縣猛力擲去。李鐵匠因爲打鐵，平日眼力很準確，這一决又是用足了平生力氣的，不偏不倚，剛巧擊中了知縣的腦袋。一時腦漿直流，就此一命嗚呼了。敲鑼喝道的幾個差役，見主人一死，也便一窩蜂逃散了。這消息傳開去以後，死了一個小漢奸不打緊，被淸兵的中將聽到，可就糟了！他委派下來的官員，地方上非但不殷懃招待，而且竟把他殺死，這還了得！平湖的百姓也知道闖下了大禍，一方面趕緊推舉出幾個紳士，召集一班年輕的漢子，加緊佈置，預備抵禦。一方面又差遣探子，隨時報吿淸兵的動靜。可是每個人早就聽過「揚州十日」「嘉定三屠」的慘事，總好像將有大禍臨頭，時刻的憂慮着屠城的危險；躲在家裏，不敢走出門去。</p>
<p>可是，事實有點使人不敢相信，隔了幾天，淸兵那裹却沒有一點動靜，平湖人也就以爲沒事了，撤去了探子，城防也漸漸的鬆懈下來，只西門留着一部分鄉勇；大街上也恢復了本來的熱鬧，屠城的恐怖，漸漸地淡薄下去。其實，淸兵眞肯罷休了麼？他們當這征服漢族，統治中國的時候，有人和他們倔强，自然認爲有損威嚴，便想把平湖人大大的懲戒一番。這懲戒不是別的，就是任意的屠殺。所以淸兵的大隊雖然仍舊不斷的南下，却抽調了一小部分，趕回平湖而來。起初淸兵見有準備，便也按兵不動，直等平湖人防守鬆懈了，才在一個晨星寥落，東方剛露魚肚白的早上，偷偷的埋伏在東門外。待等城鬥一開，　預備衝進去，殺一個爽快。可憐平湖人還在夢中，那裏知道當紅日東升起來的時候，慘酷的屠殺？這時候城門附近，一爿小麪舖裏，有一個呌王叫相公的，聽見城外一片糢糊而嘈雜的人聲，知道有異。那王四相公，雖是賣麵爲生，生長得魁悟異常；兩條臂膀，粗得像銅柱一般，頗有神力。爲人却很和善，見識也很遠，自從李鐵匠殺了那知縣以後，便知道淸兵總有一天會來的。這一天剛才起身，聽見城外喧鬧，心中巳料着幾分，私自的猜想，憑着自己一身的力氣，至少也可以支持幾個鐘頭，不使淸兵進來。立定主意，便在舖中檢了一把挺大的切麵鋼刀，足有五六十斤，袒開胸膛，咬緊牙關，掩在城門背後，等待淸兵一擁而入時，先殺一個下馬威。高大的身軀，煞像一個守門凶神。</p>
<p>遠近的鷄，都喔喔的啼了起來，天也慢慢亮了。街上趕早市的小販，越聚越多；買菜蔬的人，也忙亂的擠在人羣中；各家店鋪，相繼開了板鬥，仍舊像平時一樣熱鬧。</p>
<p>可是正在這時候，王叫相公半開了一扇城門，高舉起大刀，淸兵見城門開了，便爭先的擁進來，忽的克义一聲，大刀無情，紅光起處，一顆血淋淋的人頭，的溜溜的滾落在地上。當先的淸兵，便做了王四相公刀下之鬼。接着來的，自然也遭遇了同樣的命運，死屍橫七豎八的躺滿了一地。鮮紅的血，像泉水樣的向低處流去。王四相公殺得性起，也就越殺越有勁，越殺越有力氣。</p>
<p>這時候，全城的人也知道淸兵到了東門，王四相公一人抵禦着。於是有的携老帶小出西門北門，逃向附近的鄕下：有的關了門，躲避在家裹；連本來召集的鄉勇，也跟着跑了。熱鬧異常的街市，現在却冷淸淸；城成了死城。只有東鬥外，淸兵的吶喊聲鬧得震大價響。王四相公還守在門邊，周身都染滿了血跡，足足的和淸兵支持了兩小時。眞有一人當關，萬夫莫入之槪。</p>
<p>可是人的力氣，到底有限。殺到後來，不免力乏了，便被淸兵擁了進來，王四相公也就在淸兵的長矛亂刀下，成了肉漿。而平湖的百姓，却因爲王四相公的截住在城門口厮殺，便得以逃生，這實在是王四相公所賜予的。</p>
<p>在淸朝時候，迫於異族的淫威，對於這事，都不敢記載；只是從老年人的口中才傳下了這故事，平湖的東門，至今還留着王四相公的遺跡，每年有許多人去祭祀。前年，平湖的紳耆，還想建廟紀念：因爲抗戰開始，沒有成功。而王四相公偉大的事蹟，却永遠被人所傳誦的了。</p>
<h3>老萊子</h3>
<p>— 楓江</p>
<p>老萊子是春秋時候的楚國人，他是一個孝子，孝敬他的父母，可說是無微不至。當他在七十歲的時候他的父母還健在，他因爲要使他的父母愉快，所以自己也就忘記自己是個老頭兒，他還裝作一個小孩子的樣子穿了五彩的衣服，手裹拿着孩兒的搖鼓在地上打滾做孩兒的遊戲使他父母看見了心裏愉快，這種孝顯的故事一直傳到現在還有人稱道他。</p>
<p>老萊子固然是個賢人，但是他的妻子，更是一個有見識的賢妻，這位賢婦爲古來所稱道的賢妻典型，所以烈女傳裏也列她的名字，她曾經規勸過她又夫不要變志的故事，老萊子本是一個農人，他躬耕在蒙山的南面。有一次，楚王經過這地方，知道老萊子是個賢人因此去找他，楚王對老萊子說：『你現在很辛苦的在田野中親自耕種，是覺太苦，我願意你改變你的志向，到我們朝中去做個大官』。老萊子聽了，倒有些動心，答應楚王去做官。到了楚王去後，老萊子的妻子就大不以爲然，對着她的丈夫說道。。『我會聽到設過，凡是能够無條件的送給你吃酒吃肉的人，也可以無條件的給你鞭笞。凡是無條件的送給你做大官的，也可以無條件的給你上斧鉞的刑罰。你倒願意去做大官而變志，我倒不願被人所制服變志而和你同行。她就不顧而去。老萊子沒法祗好不去變志做官，隨他妻子同行。他妻子對他說：』我們雖然窮困，但是拿些烏和獸所脫下來的毛和羽把牠編製起來，也足够蔽寒了，把烏獸所遺下來的穀粒積集起來，也可以充飢了，何必變志求榮而爲了斗升的俸祿呢，『老萊子遂不變初衷，後世遂傳爲美談。古語道得好』小以窮變節，不以賤易志』這才能够當個大丈夫。變志求榮的人對老萊子的妻子不免要有悅色了。</p>

<p>名人傳記</p>
<h3>東莞英雄「袁崇煥」（二）</h3>
<p>— 蘭新</p>
<p>三屯營不守，遵化又失陷，滿兵長驅直入，連克薊州順義等縣。崇煥此時不得不出兵迎敵，乃駐兵沙河城外，與滿兵遙遙相對。</p>
<p>那一决他預知滿兵要米夜襲，早在營帳佈好陣勢，入夜，果然滿兵前來刦營，豈知他早有防備，殺得滿兵個個東逃西散，抱頭竄竄而去。</p>
<p>另一方面，崇煥料到滿兵遠道而來，利於速戰，不能持久。於是他更用「持久戰」的方法，同滿兵周視　。他的方法是一，堅壁淸野，所有人力物力，不爲滿兵利用，二，用少數部隊同滿兵周旋。大部實力保存待用，三，倘有損失，即再收復，事如同拉鋸，使滿兵威力，無從發展。的確，他的軍略，頗奏功效。</p>
<p>但是持久戰爭，是須要持久的政治來支持的。允其是內部意志要統一，不然便會給敵人乘機利用，因爲敵人在軍事失利的時候，是慣會用陰謀離間的手段，代替他垂死的掙扎。果如其然，滿人用了一個反間計偽造了兩件文書，呌好細投落於京城永定門外。恰巧給人拾得，拿去見懷宗。懷宗本來是相信崇煥的，現在有人說崇煥不抵抗，又加上信內盡是違反國家的私自言和的鬼話，懷宗一見大怒，說「那還了得？怪不到崇煥按兵不動，原來如此」！遂即下令，將崇煥召回斬首示衆。</p>
<p>崇煥是死了。妻子兄弟都被流放於三千里外，這樣還不够，懷宗還要下令要沒收他的家產，後來在他家里搜出幾件破舊的木器，及一箱粗布衣裳，此外一無所有，懷宗至此，始覺崇煥居官淸廉，關於求和的事，必定有誤。</p>
<p>等到眞相大白，滿兵進入中原時，懷宗乃非常懊悔！咳！崇煥死了。自從這忠勇愛國的大臣被殺後，明朝的江山危殆了。（完）</p>
<h3>難友們今後的一條出路</h3>
<p>— 孫雪曉</p>
<p>參加生產工作</p>
<p>「現在收容所裏，不是收容的難民，簡直是收容了一批懶民！」這是參加難民工作的一部份同人，和一部份熟悉收容所內情的社會人士，所發的憤話。固然，這話未免過分一些，難友們聽到了一定會起反作用。但是我們如果細細想來，却也不是無因。誠以過去一年多中，社會人士的向收容所裏　娘姨，奶媽，小工，雜差等，幾無月不有數十起之多。豈料應徵內竟寥若晨星：即使應徵了，幹不到幾天，却懊喪着仍回到收容所裏去了。收容所當局木着敎養旨趣，在所內創設着各種小工塲，招收難友參加生產工作，末了，同樣的有工無人做，以致工塲當局無法維持而停閉。據一般人的考查，認難友們的所以不高興參加生產工作，嫌工資太小，工作太苦，固是一個理由，但主要的是有收容所做食宿的依靠，不做工，無慮凍踩。</p>
<p>我想，這話如果打中一般難友們的心頭，那這一般難友的前途，必將遭遇到很大的危臉！何以見得呢？</p>
<p>大家都知道，收容所的給養，是山國內外慈善人士所捐寡。但是慈善人士並不是財神，收　所的給養接濟並不可能源源而來，換句話說，收容所有隨時解散的危險。因此，我們要是不預先找一樁工作來做，收容所一旦解散，難友們定將立刻遭到凍餒。</p>
<p>退一步講，收容所的給養，即使經國內外慈善人士的努力而源源接濟到戰事平靜的時候，不過我們要是不在這事前找一樁工作來做，準備掙積一些錢，鍛鍊一下你的身體，你將來就是能歡天喜地的回到老家去，也因你流落得兩手空空和成了惰性的身體，而不能把你給砲火摧毀了的家庭復興起來！不，至少你在復興家庭的初步階段中，是要受到相常困難。</p>
<p>何况，我國的政策是長期抗戰，所謂長期抗戰，是無限期的抗戰，少則二年三年，多則八年十年，甚至幾十年，也未可知，我們收容所也能無限期的存在嗎？我想，戰事一天一天的繼續下去，社會經濟勢將一天一天的困頓下去，那末收容所爲給養接濟的困難，必將一天嚴重一天，以至中途無法維持。那時，我們沒有事前找得事做和積得一些款項的難友，旣回不得家鄕，又留不得客鄉，將何以自處呢？</p>
<p>根據以上的理由，我認爲身爲難友的，只要是壯年，不分男和女，只要不是給對方工作，不分國人和外人，都應該找一個職業去掙錢，去鍛鍊行將懶惰的身心。决不要因爲那件工作太苦，工錢太小，而不高興去做，或是旣做了又辭退了。允其要請注意的，你們掙的錢，是血汗錢，是備作將來國土光復了回到老家去做復興家庭的資木的，不要浪費，應該儘量的撙節。</p>
<p>或者，有人要問在這粥少佾多人浮於事的孤島上，何處有我職業？何人給我工做？我想，照過去各收容所創設生產事業之多，和今後　善行政當局的蓄意加强生產事業的計劃進行，只要你肯苦幹，是不成大問題的。而且，社會人士的同情心總有的，他們只要知道你是要工做的難民，就是不馬上給工你做，但一有機位，德得儘先錄用吧！萬一這也不可能的，那不妨分頭設法一些款項，經營一些小本生意。好在吃住都有着，即使一個錢也不賺，於已僅耗一些精力而已！但這總不至於吧？否則，那非收容所裏的小本生產者，怎能每天維持着他個人的食宿甚至一家老小的食宿呢？</p>
<p>末了，我敬以至誠的態度，希望於難友大衆：</p>
<p>難友們要過渡着這空前而持久的國難關頭，唯一而安全的出路，是參加生產工作。因此，每個難友應該「無業者有業，有業者樂業。」同時，每各難友應該明白「現在撙節一個錢，將來脫離了收容所，回到老家去，就可多一分助力！」</p>
<h3>救人與殺人</h3>

<p>治水的禹王，想到天下如果有溺死的人，彷彿是他把他們溺死的。</p>

<p>我想：有能力的人們，如果不能够出力出錢，救濟難胞，而使難胞餓死凍死；那未這些餓死凍死的難胞，也就是有能力的人們，活活地把他們殺死的。不能救人，就是殺人！</p>

<h3>愛的教育（五）</h3>
<p>— 亞米契斯著　雪舫繪</p>
<p>（上）先生看洛佩梯站在桌上之後，一聲也不　，走近攏來把手撫在洛佩梯的頭上，反而說「好孩子，下次不要　做　種事了」！（下）默寫完了，先生沉靜的看著我們，用親切的聲音說「大家聽我說，我們從此要同處一年，讓我們好好的過這一年吧，大家要用功，要規矩，我沒有一個家屬，你們就是我的家屬，世界上除了你們之外，我沒有可愛的人了，你們是我的兒子，我愛你們，請你們也喜歡我，我一個也不責罰你們，請你們拿真心給我看」。</p>
<h3>一周戰事</h3>
<p>一週來，各地戰事，　有活躍之象，無論廣東與湘鄂，以及晋北一帶，皆有相當接觸，惟交戰雙方，暫時並無多大發展，當然，發展是需要主觀上客觀上來爭取的。－今日失一地，明日克一城，在表面似有出入，但實際上還是時間上的表演，在全面戰爭新階段的現在，戰爭的形式，必然是由膠着的對峙，轉而爲全面的爭取，明白了這個道理，則對於目前的戰事，正用不著焦躁，因這不是短時間的事情，修明政治，建設生產，用一切人力物力貢獻給國家，將本身利害與國家利害打成一片，這才是當前的要義。閒話少說，言歸正傳。</p>
<p>廣東戰事如拉鋸</p>
<p>廣東方面東江，石龍，增城一帶，會幾度爲華軍所克復，但日方爲了要鞏固廣州，故對增城各地，不得不拚命力爭。所以增城各地幾度爲華軍克復父幾度爲日軍所陷，好像拉鋸一樣始終在打來打去。</p>
<p>據十七日香港電一東江石灘東莞之錢，華軍與日軍在東莞一帶，相互激戰，北江日軍，昨有一部進攻粵漢路之新街，另一部則北攻花縣，以上二處，現在激戰中，至於西江方面，蘆苞蔣岸，至古勞之綫，亦在相持之下。」</p>
<p>但近來日軍，因在華南戰事失利，大有打開局勢之企圖，據傳中山沿海日艦，調增頻繁，大小艦艇，已增至百餘艘，載來軍火甚多，聞中山當局，已將有關之路綫破壞，嚴密戒備。</p>
<p>湘北戰事像踢球</p>
<p>湘北一帶戰事，時起時歇，也正如皮球一樣，一脚過來，一脚過去，據汨羅電：「日來華軍冒風雪酷寒，縱橫出入於岳州臨湘一帶，日軍雖用全力修復武岳間之路綫，但不能保證其不爲華軍所切斷，現日軍除在蒲　岳　　鐵道兩側，　築工事外，復集中岳州桃林之日軍，猛力向岳州迤東之華軍進犯，一方面更驅其在烏江橋之日軍向南，犯華方之雙龍灣，以牽制華方野戰軍北援，現在正在激戰中。」</p>
<p>晉西戰事節節勝利</p>
<p>晋西戰事，刻仍在激烈進行中，日軍雖以全力向晋西進攻，其目的無非欲肅淸華軍之主力，然後渡河西犯陝省，但此項企圖，華方早有準備，上週激戰之結果，華方因戰略關係，曾一度放棄吉縣，大寗，蒲縣，鄕寗等處，近來華軍增援，開始大舉反攻，經三畫夜苦戰之結果，卒將所失諸地，先後克復，據西安方面電傳</p>
<p>「晋西華軍克大寗午城後，向北疾進，蒲縣，黑龍關兩處華軍已會合，迫近土門，向臨汾進攻，同時大部華軍，正圍攻石樓。」</p>

<h3>遮眼法</h3>
<p>— 魯進</p>
<p>據說江湖上的術士，都有一種「法術」可以使人在不知不覺之間，受他們的欺騙。這種「法術」，呌做「遮眼法」。意思是祇要你的眼請偶一被他遮蔽，你的錢鈔，或是値錢的東西，在這一轉瞬間，不翼而飛了。魔術師有句口頭語，呌「眼睛一霎，老孵鷄變鴨」，就相彷彿似的。</p>
<p>馬路上的「翻犬印」，也是利用這種「遮眼法」，騙取鄉曲的錢財，不過他們還有點「强賒硬賣」的神氣，膽怯的人是會望而却步的。高明的術士是吿訴你一元鈔票，能變成百元，如果不相信，可以當塲試騐，於是公館裹的阿媽商店里的職員，認爲「生財有道」，或偷或竊，凑上一個數目，誠心誠意地向什麼祖師叩起頭來，但在一叩之間，鈔票變了廢紙，而那術士呢，已鴻飛冥其，在旅館里徵嚮導姑娘，或在酒樓上大灌黃湯了。</p>
<p>而今，這「法術」却「爲用至廣」起來，連呌人「屈膝」的國家，也不惜「降格以求」，施用起「遮眼法」來了。</p>
<p>譬如說罷：先放出一個空氣，他們已投資數百萬於中國電影公司，說是「文化合作」的開始。但是中國影業公司却屹然不動，而中國同胞的眼睛也是看得淸淸楚楚的。乃說「遺派所謂文化份子，及著作家多人，會同影業代表，來滬積極活動」，並且以他們收買的「公司」來舉例，向各方「遊說」，但是結果呢，「本市電影裂片業，在戰事以後，即抱堅壁淸野主義，與環境奮鬥，任何利誘威迫，决不爲動，大義凜然，態度堅决」！而那不知自愛的「公司」也早巳被國人唾棄了！</p>
<p>「遮眼法」是祇能施之於游移的人們的，譬如你不想發財，其法即無處可施；大義凜然，當然更無可活動。「一手不能掩盡天下人耳目」現在僅僅是遮「眼」，其不失敗也幾希！</p>
<p>何况到了眞刀眞槍的時候，還是來一個「百年戰爭」吧</p>
<p>那時，「武則天」底作者宋之的先生，因爲賀孟斧的關係，改了「宋一舟」這筆名正在西北影片公司擔任編劇的職務。他和王女士相處日子一久，竟彼此熱戀上了，於是兩人坦白地開始了甜蜜的性愛的同居生活。</p>
<p>民國念五年夏，他們重來上海，卜居在呂班路的一家雜貨店的小樓上。</p>
<p>王蘋和老宋，他們兩個兒不但志向相投，性格相同，甚至連嗜好也是一樣的。兩個人都很豪爽，尙隨便，喜抽紙烟，愛喝紹興酒。瞧，眞是踏破鐵鞋也難覓到的一對名符其實的「天作之合」底情侶哩</p>
<p>不是笑話，說的完全是事實：王蘋在夏天穿的單旗袍，據說是不掉換的，今天是這件，明天是這件，後天也還是這件。髒麼？管它，反正穿在自個兒的身上，不關別人的事。實在髒得不能再穿了，換下來向床底下一丟，也就沒有事了。老宋呢？也是一樣，到他家要去玩，滿屋子只見是他的臭襪子，床上一隻，地上一雙，寫字臺上也有一隻。但，他們夫婦倆却都「視若無睹，誰都若無其事呢。</p>
<p>在另一方面說，他們又是劇壇上最革命的一對藝人夫婦。他們爲了要喚醒全中國的百姓，他們跑遍了全國各地，一年零五個月來，他們吃盡了千辛萬苦，始終咬緊着牙根，堅毅地窮幹着救亡的戲劇運動。</p>
<p>現在，他們在重慶，我願他們在那見撒播的救亡戲劇的種子，在最近的將來，開出美麗的花朶來</p>
<p>敬禮，一對努力救亡戲劇的藝人！</p>
<h3>劇壇外史</h3>
<p>— 瞿史公</p>
<p>略施脂粉，愛梳兩條小辮子的王蘋女士，看過上海業餘劇團公演「武則天」的人們，總不會很快地便忘了她給戲裏的老尼姑所創造的那個活生生的形象的吧。</p>
<p>王蘋，她是南京人，眞名應該寫作「光珍」。</p>
<p>是的，王蘋就是王光珍，諸位要不是健忘的話，也該還記得民國念四年春，曾轟動京滬，不，全國劇壇的一件事情罷——南京興中門小學的一個女敎員，爲了參加了磨風劇社演出易卜生底名劇「娜拉」，便給學校當局除名的一回事罷？所說那個女敎員不是別人，正是我今天所要介紹的王蘋女士。</p>
<p>被攆出了首都興中門小學的王光珍，後來經了友人的介紹，跑往山西太原進了西北影片公司，在水銀燈下當一個電影演員。「王蘋」這名字也就在這時改喚的。</p>

<p>— 同光作</p>
<h3>北海漁光</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>“Soawn　of　the　North”</p>
<p>派拉蒙公司出品　大光明戲院開映</p>
<p>「北海漁光」是說兩個義同手足的硬性漢子的故事，泰勒和吉姆都是漁民，泰勒後來爲海盜瑞德利誘，合了夥，去盜漁民的阱魚，給吉姆打傷了，「瑞德見勢不佳，委棄泰勒率衆逸去吉姆界泰勒返岸洽療」</p>
<p>瑞德給漁民擊敗以後、對吉姆恨之剌骨，便思有以報復，「泰勒知其心存不善，懇與同行，」中途便乘機把瑞穗關在艙裹，而他自己便把船駛向冰山，人舟俱毀，葬身碧海中</p>
<p>這偭故事是悲壯的，泰勒和吉姆的友誼更使人感動。通過畫面，那素樸的漁村風光和血性男兒的剛毅率直的性格，眞使人有說不出的可愛。他們頑皮，跳跳鬧鬧，不知道什麼呌憂煩愁苦，而這樣素樸的氣質則是由於他們有着强健的身體，這就不但使人感到可愛，並且是使人羨慕了。更可感動的是漁民們的抵抗海盜，用生命的力量來保護用生命的力量所獲得的東四，使之不受損害；在那緊張的織接中，使人聯想到我們受損害的漁業和漁民，以及在爲祖國的生存而搏鬥的弟兄們。吉姆在用槍射倒了泰勒以後，他的悵惘的腦部特寫是使人感動的，而觀衆在心底的反應是什麼呢？「大夫無私交」，不管是從那一點來看，怪他多此一舉是不會的。</p>
<p>「北海漁光」着重於泰勒和吉姆的友誼，因此對於漁民的疾苦和羣衆的力量都减削了，這是最大的損失。不然，道部戲是會有他更大的價値的。</p>
<p>像現在這樣，它固然是使我們感到友情的可貴，也感動於那些血性漢子的生命力，因爲這樣它使祇會談情說愛的洋塲遺少，顯得亳無能力而且可憎，但這股生命的激流若是歸之於海，在海潮中澎湃奔騰，這是怎樣的一幅激動的塲面呢</p>
<p>導演者亨利哈薩威對這樣的戲是有可貴的經騐的，渾厚激動，很有他的氣魄，特別是每個脚色，在他的處理下，是顯得那樣生命力的豐富而又各各不同，眞是非常値得贊佩。</p>
<p>喬治賴甫德的泰勒很不壞，雖然嚴裕言之，還有點都市裏的流氓味，而不純粹是個粗樸的漁民；亨利方達則怯弱了一點，戲是演得好的，外形上總覺得還欠結實；可贊美的是桃樂姍拉摩，她的都市的媚惑的氣息給洗去了，她的健美的體格帶助了成爲一個活潑鮮跳的人物，阿金湯米洛夫的瑞德則與他的外形很相稱，戲也平穩得很；的翰巴里穆亞在這裹飾一個地方報紙的主筆，戲並不重要，老去了的藝人呵！</p>
<h3>貧民窟剪影</h3>
<p>— 志</p>
<p>在星加坡路轉角處，展開在人們眼前的，是一幅悽慘的流民圖。</p>
<p>崎嶇的亂石堆裏，僅僅用幾塊木板，蓋上一些稻草，這樣就成了他們的家。</p>
<p>在這間簡陋的屋子裏，他們吃飯，睡覺都在這裏，甚至拉屎亦在這裏。</p>
<p>一扇破門上，已被小三子書滿了不少的圖畫，「姜太公在此」的紅紙條被北風吹去半截了。</p>
<p>因爲沒有水溝，所以汚水自然地匯在一起，越積越多，漸漸變成一個池塘，雖然是嚴冬時分，但亦會有陰濕的臭味，送進鼻官來。</p>
<p>如果一連下了幾天雨，那更糟糕，非但道路泥濘，行不得也哥哥，而且屋子裏，亦會滴搭滴搭下起毛毛雨來。</p>
<p>住在這屋子裏的人，無論男女老幼，却不能像收容所裏的難民，袖着手兒，祇知道瞰飯，他們每天爲了三餐吃不飽的飯，不得不流盡血汗，來維持生活</p>
<p>像男的大半是去幹拉車，碼頭小工，小販……女的能上工廠去做工，已算是幸運，吾則便蹲在地上，敲敲石塊，就是小孩子亦得背了竹筐去拾荒貨。</p>
<p>可憐他們掙扎在飢餓錢上，胼手胝足，已是十分可憐，但是時常還有意外不幸事情的發生，像大地主的勒令遷移，和經手人的層層敲詐，都是使他們絲亳沒有反抗力量的，除了飲泣吞聲，委曲求全外，可說是別無辦法！</p>
<p>願熱心的社會人士，別再漠視這弱小的一羣，而予以有力的扶助才是。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二回　林工師妙解標準化　金導員高談平等觀</p>
<p>並且兩人雖是同學工藝的，兩人却又是於工藝之外，各有嗜好。何雙玉是喜歡音樂的，何佩玉却是喜歡繪畫的，這也算是各趨一端，但是兩人又一樣的聰明。金小姐那時笑道：於剛　我們講標準化時，我想到了，現在各種工藝，都要標準化，怎麼人也標準化起來了。不是人也標準化，怎麼你們兩位姊姊是一個樣子的呢」？何佩玉道：「你這痴話少說吧」！金澹雲道：「就爲的是痴話，所以剛纔沒有說出來。不然，建成又是什麼野話都說得出來的」。正說着建成時，只見建成遠遠地來了。便問她們花已買好了沒有？說：已買好了。金小姐代付了一塊錢，黃家媽媽說：還有得多。金小姐道：算了！算了」！林建成陪着她們，便穿進白石牌坊來。那個先烈墓，規模之大，氣象之閎，不亞於南京的孫陵。就只孫陵是建築在山上，它是建築在平原上。從白石碑坊進去是一條甬道，兩傍的松柏，巳茂鬰成林。甬道直達一座殿堂，這是每逢春秋兩以祀及紀念日公家來次祭奠之所，大殿之外，一個很廣闊的白石平台，也有些石雕的美術品，都是各國體當時捐建的。此外却是大盆的花木，栽着常靑之樹，不凋之花，收拾得也分外淸潔，從大殿旁的迥廊轉到後面去，便是烈士墓了，方方的一大塊，上有饅頭頂式，好似敎堂裏　頂。前面有一方大理石刻金字的墓碑。四周裝置了許多插花枝的瓶兒，只見都插滿了花枝。有的花枝巳經是枯萎的了，有的花枝尙還新鮮，這可見得是每天總有人來膽仰先烈墓而到此獻花了。何家兩位小姐把自己手中所執的每一束花，也插到了花瓶裹去。恰巧那裏並排有兩個空瓶，金小姐幫着她們，把花束插進去，剛剛正好。那是這裏的花店裏，知道花束的大小尺寸的，然後她們對於過去的烈士，爲國捐軀的先烈，致了敬禮，靜默了一二鐘。又約略　　了一下子，那辰光巳是午餐時候了。金小姐道：「那末我們法吃飯吧！吃了飯，我們再到這裹幾個地方去看看，你們意思怎麼樣」？（二〇）</p>

<h3>黃柳霜改變作風</h3>
<p>— 曉</p>
<p>好萊的影星中，黃帝子孫是罕見的——只有兩位，奇巧的兩人也都姓「黃」：第一位是常見其藝術而不見其人的攝影師黃宗沾；第二位便是在外片中時飾華人的黃柳霜。</p>
<p>她的父親是一位旅美已久的華僑。她生於美國洛山磯，在她沒有回祖國之前，她從沒有離開洛山磯一步過。因爲洛山磯地近影國之都好萊塢甚近，耳濡目染，從小她就對電影發生了興趣——差不多每天在放學後總要看决電影；同時閃羨慕明星生活之故，而就引起了她長大後作明星的願望。</p>
<p>她幼時在家黃柳霜」，但是時，則改爲「愛歲時就在南齊穆星）所主演的「紅Lantern）中而獲得了相常的默片時代，充當內的名字是呌「進美國學校求學娜梅黃」。十二伐女士（已故紅燈籠」（Red充當過臨時演員成功。此後更在「他童彼得遜一「月宮寳盒」中的演員。此後，她不但電影技術方面受人歡迎而在紐的舞台上也受人稱讚尤允其是大作家埃格華雷斯名著On　the　spot　一劇中更爲美人所欽佩。　以前關於她的作風，是令人有些不滿的——多是在辱華影片中演出；但是自從前數年她初决回到祖國遊歷後，她的作風是改變了。往常地，她還在英國廣播公司管理下的電台上表演，爲祖國吹噓，爲祖國的抗戰呼籲。</p>
<p>今年在孤島各大戲院開映過的「孝女懲奸記」，「屍諫」及「星命洗寃錄When　are　you　Born，就是她改愛作風後之作。</p>
<h3>談談南方戲</h3>
<p>— （筆花）</p>
<p>南方戲因冠以南方二字，在南方一帶，確實風行。在上海亦紅過一時，演員以吳籍居多，唱詞脫胎崑腔，觀者以蘇帮佔多數，允以婦女趨之若騖。良以唱句通俗，耐人尋味，惜均在遊戲塲搭班，雖曾一度獨立組班，因所排戲劇，皆老生常談，千篇一律，無創造性，致難立足，相繼失敗。近則跑上電臺，度彼播音生活，頗受聽衆歡迎。吾謂南方戲如能再加改革，編排新戲，不難在戲劇界中佔得一席地，惜乎墨守陳法，不圖上進，與維鑤戲蹦蹦戲等同趨落伍，言念及此，能不慨然！願領導南方戲者，力圖猛晋，勿讓彼紹興戲申曲等專美於前可耳。</p>
<h3>記「月亮上升」等獨幕劇</h3>
<p>— 江上</p>
<p>藝林劇社－第二次公演</p>
<p>昨天是藝林劇社星期劇塲第二次的公演。我對於該社的過往，知道得很少，但就這兩决的公演所給我的印象，使我發生了很濃厚的興趣，這决演出的計有：「徵婚」，「月亮東升」，「騎馬下海的人」，三個獨幕劇。爰就管見所及，寫一些在下面，想亦爲愛好話劇的同志們所樂聞吧。</p>
<p>關於劇本問題，頗有人貴備藝林社不合時代。可是處此環境之中，壓迫重重，儘有很好的，很適　時代的劇本，也無法排演。所以兩决的演出，都是屬於社會問題之類的。這决所用的三個獨慕劇本，除了「徵婚」是陳白塵所著者外，其餘兩個都是舶來品。</p>
<p>開幕第一劇即是「徵婚」，劇情是詩人娶過三個妻子，都不能偕老。於是登報徵婚，準備將一切的女性，大大地玩弄一下，以資報復。可是來應徵的都是些可憐蟲，使他很失望。末了竟又來了他的第二位妻子。她終於察出他的伎倆，托辭一去不來。詩人結果是失敗了。靈子飾詩人，以身份論，比他上回飾「劉三爺」中的兒子要適合許多。他唯一的長處是口齒淸晰，動作方面，有許多不自覺的過火。但還不覺得有什麼弊病。</p>
<p>第二劇是「月亮上升，」劇情是一個警長欲得懸實而深夜訪浦越獄犯人。遇一賣唱者，不料賣唱者即是犯人，也即是警長以前的老友。警長激於忠義，終於讓他逃走了。原劇極耐人尋味，而且富有刺　力量。飾警長的王竹友與飾賣唱者的楊有爲，對演劇頗有經騐。警長的動作，頗具綫條美，允其是賣唱者在被發覺爲犯人時的前後，演來判若兩人，極爲難得。</p>
<p>最後的是「騎馬下海的人」，劇情很簡單，一個愛爾蘭老婦喪失了一個愛航海冒險的兒子。祗剩着兩個女兒安慰她。劇意含蓄過隱，多數觀衆，難以明瞭。此劇中飾長女的唐琪，飾决女娜拉的菊年，音調淸晰甜美，也很自然而不費勁。此外飾母親的白荻，還能稱職</p>
<p>我覺得演話劇與別的戲劇，更重耍的是劇中無論主角配角，人材都需相稱。一個配角的不稱職，即使全劇都遜色。戲劇是民衆敎育的重耍工具，我希望藝林社能不辭艱苦，努力奮鬥下去！</p>

<h3>銀色新聞</h3>
<p>— 辛士</p>
<p>攝影師顏鶴嗚，去歲曾用十六咪小型膠片，將其自製機械，拍過一部筱文濱申曲影片，——劇名「賢慧媳婦」獲得了相當的成功。爲此冉接再厲，决意籌組公司，專用小型片拍戲，因爲它的映出效果與普通片相等，成本上則較輕减不少，確是一個很好的取巧辦法。最近，他正忙於找尋適當基地，準備趕造攝影塲。第一片劇本業巳編妥，名「蝴蝶姑娘」－一是一個雜有苗人在內的故事。並經聘定了李萍倩任導演，顧蘭君孫敏兩人主演。同時，且擬運用飛機寄往美國冲洗辦法，攝爲局部的五彩片。這計劃一旦見諸實現，足爲國產片開一新的紀錄。</p>
<p>「王先生」湯傑兩度入川，飽經磨難。在去年秋間，他早返回上海，膺聘新華。那位老搭擋「小陳」曹雪松，則仍留居蜀中，從事抗戰工作。他們倆從此天涯海角，各目西東；也和勞萊，哈代那樣。兩下拆夥了。近來，湯傑編就了一部「王先生吃飯難」的新劇本，是部描寫世態炎凉與失業苦痛的會得使人看了從笑聲中流出熱淚來的滑稽作品。劇中「小陳一一角，並不露面，只有一封給「王先生」薦生意的從四川寄來的介紹信；這點上，就是爲了顧及曹雪松不在上海，特地把它設法隱去，倒亦頗足見其一番巧思的。</p>
<p>談瑛的鼻子右面，近曾患一疔瘡；起先來勢甚猛，疼痛異常；延醫施治，亦未見效，因爲之大感着急。旋經友人介紹，改請陶芭生醫士洽療之後，居然極爲得手：現在她的粉頰上早見腫退瘡消，還只留上了一個小小的疤痕。陶醫生且爲聲說：「决可保證回復原狀，絕對不會如白璧微瑕般的損及了美姿。」她們拍演電影在這上面原是極關重要的，談瑛得此結果，大感愉快，差不多是吃了一服定心丸了！</p>
<h3>名旦馮子和之軼事</h3>
<p>— 靜廬</p>
<p>春航近復出演於黃金矣，此老久洗鉛華，絕跡紅毺，自法歲應卡爾登周信芳之堅請，盛情難却，始允客串二天，重露色相，盛世元音，典型猶存，誠曲界之寶也；吾知此番獻奏，允當傾倒不少周郎，其生平軼事彌多，茲錄一二，爲愛馮郎者告。</p>
<p>馮郎享名，在畹華之前，當時能與相頡頏者，僅賈璧雲一人，顧曲界各捧所好，有馮黨賈黨之稱。老鄕親孫菊仙與子和同隸丹桂，極表器重，孫素不輕與人合演三娘敎子一劇，因薛保須向三娘下跪也，有之，即春航而巳。輒逢宴會，雖無小馮，亦必與偕，其提被不遣餘力，有如此者。</p>
<p>馮以演馮小靑一劇名於時，民四年，嘗偕柳亞子，陸鄂不諸子同遊吾杭西湖，在孤山小靑慕前憑弔久之，亞子特樹碑墓側，以誌其事，足與此絕代佳人同留爲湖上之雋話矣。</p>
<p>人咸謂畹華發明古裝，實則子和遠在其前，如七月七一劇所穿拖帔，即爲其一，富麗美觀，時下坤伶均爭仿之。此外，彼尙首創　新戲蘇白，　取消前綫尾子，　樂器加奏二胡，演貴妃醉酒一劇，由乃兄馮三狗操京胡，吳桂芬操二胡，　小嗓唱鎖吶二簧，如大香山，妻黨同惡報，賣花三娘子諸劇皆是，於劇藝上之貢獻，厥功甚偉。</p>
<p>此老畢貫中西，晚年好佛，喜與人談禪，近爲余題紀念冊，有「衆生本來是佛，佛亦本是衆生，塵點劫何前何後，妙蓮花不古不今」之匈，筆致峻峭，亦伶倫中早倡風雅之一人也。</p>

<h3>略談金素雯</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>你說奇怪不？我初看見素雯，就覺得面熟得很，彷彿在什麼地方見過似的。怎麼想也不明白究竟，或者她天生就有人緣的相貌。我們正不必用花容月貌來形容女人的好看，你要是看素雯的面貌，這裏有相片爲證。她很懂世故人情，說話時候透着嫩，有點兒吞吞吐吐，孩子氣未脫，一來就發急，惹不起——道全是女子的特點。</p>
<p>我近來不大聽戲，所以素雯在台上，我還沒有見過。前天晚上看文素臣，那　戲自不相說了，好得很，她在那　裏，扮的璇姑，眞的描摹得淋漓盡致。在電裏我們不必把余紫雲，時小福拉一塊兒來說了吧！戲是跟　時代走的，這種戲跟潮流，那麼演員也得如此，真是不很容易的。</p>

<h3>Active Guerrilla Activities in Northern Jiangxi; Japanese Troops at Zhuling Suffer Heavy Losses; Guerrillas Take Advantage of Victory to Descend the Mountain and Disrupt the Railway; Extensive Damage to the Nanxun Railway Line</h3>
<p>Wanjiabu: Guerrilla forces in various parts of northern Jiangxi have recently united into one, supporting each other. When Japanese troops recently besieged the Chinese Lushan guerrilla forces, the Chinese Minshan guerrilla forces repeatedly attacked the rear of the Japanese troops, making it impossible for the Japanese troops to attend to both the front and the rear. On the 19th, in order to ensure the safety of their rear, the Japanese troops divided their forces to put pressure on Zhuling, north of the Chinese Minshan. The Chinese army had pre-arranged an ambush at the foot of the mountain, and when the Japanese troops approached, they were attacked. The Japanese troops were greatly defeated, suffering more than fifty casualties. The Chinese also captured five Japanese heads and a large number of other military supplies. On the afternoon of the 20th, the Japanese troops reinforced with more than 300 men and four artillery pieces, attempting to counterattack. The Chinese Zhuling defenders vowed to resist to the death, engaging in several hand-to-hand combats. A certain commander of the Chinese guerrillas personally went to the front line with a certain battalion commander to direct the battle. After fierce fighting until dusk of that day, the Japanese troops were completely defeated. The Japanese troops fled in disarray, leaving behind dozens of bodies. The Chinese army captured several rifles and countless other military supplies. The Chinese side suffered only four casualties. At night, the Chinese army took advantage of the victory and sent teams in eight directions down the mountain, extensively damaging the Nanxun Railway line between Majialing and Shahe, and chopping down dozens of telegraph poles, capturing several bundles of telegraph wire, over a dozen iron plates, and over a hundred screws.

<h3>Overall Relief Measures for Disaster Victims; Government Plans to Establish Work-Relief Zones; Xu Shiying Arrives in Hong Kong from Chongqing; Reports the Disaster Situation to Chairman Lin; Central Government Has Allocated Disaster Relief Funds</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xu Shiying has arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing. According to talks, he reported the disaster situation in South China to Chairman Lin. Lin is extremely concerned about the disaster victims in South China. The overall relief measures have been decided upon by convening a relief committee, roughly to establish work-relief zones, using work as a substitute for relief. In the future, land will be allocated, and the environment must be carefully observed to find suitable locations. Twenty million yellow disaster refugees have received relief, and they are now moved to the upper reaches of the Yellow River to cultivate, and their lives should be stable. The central government has already allocated disaster relief funds, but still hopes for assistance from all parties. It is heard that Xu will serve as the Deputy President of the Executive Yuan, but Xu remains modest. (Special dispatch, 1 AM, 23rd)</p>

Therefore, the Japanese troops stationed in Hangzhou are extremely panic-stricken. The Japanese troops have made preparations to withdraw, but transportation on the Beijing-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines is under the control of the Chinese army, so the Japanese troops are trapped in a large encirclement. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops on the Border of Shaanxi Have Strict Defenses</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shaanxi Electric: The fighting in western Shanxi is easier to defend because the Yellow River has not yet frozen. Therefore, the Japanese army's attempt to cross the river to spy westward has repeatedly failed. Now most of the army defends the strongholds of Hejin, Linjin, Jishan, Xiangning, and Puxian, and only a small part disturbs the Tongpu Road to the west. The Japanese army is constantly increasing its reinforcements and moving towards the highway, seemingly still planning a major attack. The Chinese side has taken strict precautions.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Review of Speeches by Japanese Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>The annual meeting of the Japanese Diet opened the day before yesterday. Cabinet members, starting with the Prime Minister, attended the meeting as usual, each outlining their aspirations according to their respective positions. Traditionally, Japan has regarded the beginning of each year as a political season, and the Diet has been the center of attention, both domestically and internationally. However, now that the military cliques are rampant and the political parties have declined, the Diet is like a sacrificial sheep, merely a timely and decorative ornament in the political paraphernalia. Reflecting on the past and present, how can one not sigh? And the impact is not only the misfortune of one country and one event. The hope for restoring the old order lies only after China's victory in the War of Resistance! Nevertheless, the Cabinet members' speeches in the Diet were not intended solely for the members of the Diet. The moribund atmosphere of the Diet is precisely because of the overbearing authority of the Cabinet. Therefore, in-Diet speeches, regardless of whether their content is true or false, are, in their essence, materials that should be paid attention to. Moreover, in wartime, speeches involving the Far East are particularly numerous!</p>
<p>Telegrams reported the speeches of four Japanese cabinet members the day before yesterday: Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai. Details of Yonai's speech were not reported. Itagaki's speech is worth mentioning: he said that Chinese troops west of the Pinghan Railway numbered 170,000; between Changsha and Nanchang, 300,000; in Guangdong Province, 200,000; in Guangxi Province, 150,000; and in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, 210 divisions, numbering 1,000,000. The true magnitude of the Chinese army is another matter; the Japanese estimate for the aforementioned regions is as follows. Other areas, such as the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Jinpu Railway, and the vast and expansive guerrilla warfare zones inside and outside the Great Wall, as well as the reserves of potential strength in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other northwestern hinterlands, are all beyond the scope of his calculations.</p>
<p>The speeches of Hiranuma and Arita should be the focus of world attention, but they offer no new insights; they are empty, superficial, outwardly fierce but inwardly weak. Perhaps this symbolizes the national strength of an invading country that has engaged in prolonged expeditions with no success? To summarize the two men's words, they revolve around the so-called "New Order," and the rest, such as using puppet organizations as the so-called "new Chinese government," using opposition to communism as a cliché for invading China, and using the distribution of spoils as bait to cater to aggressors, are all tired and discredited clichés that the world has long been weary of. If the telegrammed speeches fully represent their essence, then the speeches have no value at all. However, there are some noteworthy points: given the recent tough attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States toward Japan, Hiranuma and Arita were vague in their statements, and did not dare to explicitly name the UK and US, to avoid provoking them. While repeatedly claiming to be anti-communist, they only relied on the German-Italian agreement to bolster their position, and said that their dispute with the Soviet Union was only about mining rights and fisheries. Given the hesitancy and uncertainty of French Indochina, and the fact that Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun had just criticized it at the League of Nations Executive Council, Arita singled it out as a target of criticism, saying: "If the transport of military supplies to China from French Indochina continues, Japan will decide to take appropriate action." Comparing this with the attitude towards several countries, the degree of lightness and emphasis is difficult to compare. Is it love or hate? Is it profit or harm? Considering history and reality, it would not be wrong to say that the feelings of gratitude and resentment are reversed. Why is this? By observing their bias, one can glean the helpless mood of the Japanese authorities. Offending the public, the situation is deteriorating day by day, with nothing to comfort its people, and yet wanting to show the people that it is not weak externally, they deliberately put on a fierce face, pretending to have the courage to "decide to take appropriate action." Knowing full well that China's international transportation does not rely on a single route; empty threats will not help, cutting off transportation is beyond their ability, and attempting it would incur the wrath of the powerful, they avoid the real and focus on the empty, only mentioning Annam. However, it is not entirely without other intentions. Today, Japan's greatest concern in the international arena is the cooperation of democratic nations. If it has the ability to make the nations not plot against each other, and stay out of it, then Japan would be more able to act without restraint. Singling out Annam is simply a small test of the strategy of divide and conquer among the democratic nations on diplomacy. Moreover, with the anti-communist agreement as a link, Japan, Germany, and Italy seem to be one entity. The German-Italian axis in Europe is plotting to alienate England and France, and concentrating arrows at France. Japan's criticism of France is also to show Germany and Italy an echo. From a military strategy perspective, the Japanese navy covets China's Hainan Island most eagerly, drooling with desire, but cannot help but be wary of France. Therefore, today's criticism of France is precisely to lay the groundwork for occupying Hainan Island in the future, which is not known either.</p>
<p>The speeches of Hiranuma and Arita were in the Japanese Diet; those watching the opening of the Diet included the Tokyo diplomatic corps. German and Italian representatives were probably delighted that the anti-communist agreement could serve as material for the speeches. Soviet representatives probably understood their bluffing and smiled knowingly. Only the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have sent protests as they did, and having heard the Japanese authorities' statements as such, shouldn't they think of how to continue after the protest?</p>
<h3>British Government Continues Economic Aid to China, Providing Some Comfort to Various Circles in China; Chongqing Newspaper Hopes Allied Powers Will Take Further Action Against Japan</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The news reported by the London Daily Mail that the British government will provide China with a loan of 3 million pounds to support the Chinese legal tender, and that the arrangements are nearing completion, may slightly reduce the disappointment felt by various Chinese circles regarding the resolution passed by the League of Nations Council. According to the Central Daily News, this loan is a sign of more active British aid to China. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, senior Chinese government officials, in discussions with an Associated Press reporter regarding the "Daily Mail" report from London about the British loan to China, expressed great optimism. However, officials close to H.H. Kung were unwilling to make any comments, stating that they had no authority to inform about the loan. Financial circles seemed to believe that the British loan to China would definitely succeed, although the exact amount was still unknown. Observers pointed out that the loans from the United Kingdom and the United States to China are a gesture of opposition to Japan's military aggression against China. (AP, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, various Chinese newspapers commented that the French government, following the United States and the United Kingdom, sent a note to Japan, which was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 19th of this month. The full text of the French note has not yet been published, but according to a Havas dispatch from Paris on the 18th, responsible figures in Paris stated, "The French government declared in this note that any unilateral action to revise the Nine-Power Treaty is not acceptable to France. The 'new order' that Japan seeks to establish in China contradicts this treaty and is sufficient to harm the rights held by France, which France cannot condone." According to the above dispatch, the content of the French government's note to Japan is roughly the same as the content of the notes from the United States and the United Kingdom to Japan. The main points are: (1) Any unilateral action to revise the Nine-Power Treaty by force cannot be recognized. (2) Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia" contradicts the Nine-Power Treaty and is sufficient to harm the rights held by the signatory nations, which will not be tolerated. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, important signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, have made their attitudes clear. Their understanding of the Far Eastern issue is extremely clear and accurate. However, they are simultaneously taking similar actions, warning Japan with a frank attitude and resolute language. This resolution is still the first resolution. This is the first instance of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France taking parallel action, which is sufficient to prove that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are prepared to shift from passive protests to active measures in order to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty and restore the international order, justice, and peace in the Far East. The governments and peoples of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France feel that Japan's illegal aggression and destructive treaty behavior in the Far East cannot be stopped by protests alone. They must frankly and resolutely state their position and try to take active action, and such active action must be parallel in order to be effective. Among the important countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty, in addition to China, which is at the forefront, the first to be mentioned should be the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan, while Italy is not included. We only need to look at the Four-Power Treaty signed by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Japan during the Washington Conference to maintain peace in the Pacific and the Far East, which did not include Italy, and we can know that the most important countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty are only the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan. Now Japan unilaterally uses force to destroy the implementation of the treaty and implement an aggressive policy, insisting that the Nine-Power Treaty is no longer applicable to the current situation and that the treaty must be revised in order to establish Japan's so-called "new order." However, the other important countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty have individually published common views, refuting the Japanese fallacies, believing that (1) the Nine-Power Treaty had achieved the good results expected at the time before the Sino-Japanese Incident; (2) the current situation in the Far East was entirely caused by Japan's informal use of force; (3) the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are still applicable in fact and in law today; (4) unilateral actions to revise the treaty by force cannot be recognized by any country; (5) Japan's so-called "new order" is completely contrary to the existing and effective charter, and no country can accept it. China is the country at the forefront, and China's opinion is put aside for the moment, but the important countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty, and at the same time are not parties to this incident, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, have all reached a common conclusion through individual observations. This is certainly not accidental. Even other countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty and countries that did not sign the Nine-Power Treaty but have important relations in the Pacific, although they have not sent notes to Japan at this time, their observations and conclusions, with the exception of one or two countries with ulterior motives, are largely consistent with the content of the notes sent to Japan by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. This can be seen from their past statements and actions. The above points are sufficient to prove that Japan's statements are absurd and Japan's actions are illegal. The nations' understanding of the Far Eastern issue is extremely clear, their position is extremely firm, their attitude is frank, and their wording is straightforward. The only thing lacking is active and resolute action. On the one hand, we hope that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France can quickly take active action. On the other hand, we will further strengthen our own efforts to resist Japan, in order to jointly sanction the aggressors in the Far East with countries in the world that love justice and peace and uphold treaty faith, in order to restore international order in the Pacific region.</p>
<p>The purpose of France's note to Japan this time is to safeguard "the rights held by France," but at the same time it is also to maintain international justice and the dignity of the charter. We would like to express our deep gratitude to the French government and people. France is indeed worthy of being a great country that loves freedom and peace, worthy of their ancestors in the era of the Great Revolution. France is now in a rather difficult situation in Europe, but it cannot ignore its position and interests in the Far East. Punishing one as a warning to a hundred, the result of France's cooperation with the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East may be conducive to the peaceful resolution of European issues. Japan is the weakest link in the alliance of aggressors. To restore international order in the world, we must start with sanctioning Japan. (Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Chinese Official Comments: Arita's Speech Combines Intimidation and Enticement; Allied Powers Will Never Be Moved by It</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese officials are unwilling to criticize the speeches of Hiranuma and Arita in the Japanese Diet in Tokyo, saying that they only repeated statements about organizing a new order in East Asia. However, it is pointed out that Arita's words should be regarded as a continued disregard for the position of the United Kingdom and the United States, ignoring the recent tough notes submitted to Japan by the United Kingdom and the United States. On the other hand, Arita also tried his best to intimidate France and the Soviet Union. Neither the United Kingdom nor the United States can believe Japan's sweet talk, and neither France nor the Soviet Union will be threatened by Japan's bluster. Japan has repeatedly resolved to protest to France about the transportation of munitions from Vietnam. If Japan makes such threats again, it only shows that it regards the entire civilized world as an enemy. France and the Soviet Union are both member states of the League of Nations and are willing to abide by the League of Nations' resolution to help China resist military aggression. France and the Soviet Union will never yield to Japan's verbal intimidation. (AP, 22nd)</p>
<h3>France Resolves to Maintain Transportation Between China and Vietnam; Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Paris) The outside world is not criticizing Foreign Minister Arita's threat in the Diet yesterday that Japan will take retaliatory measures against France, and it is not believed that France intends to change its policy of transportation between Annam and China. (AP, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Rumors that the French government has prohibited commercial trucks and Red Cross ambulances from being transported to China via French Indochina have been denied by responsible persons, stating that the government did indeed temporarily ban trucks from being transported to China via French Tonkin after the fall of Guangzhou, China, in early November of last year, in order to avoid excessive congestion at the port of Haiphong, but it immediately restored the original situation, which has been more than two months. As for the transportation of Red Cross ambulances to China, it has never been restricted in any way and special measures have been taken to facilitate it. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a dispatch from Paris, the newspaper Ordre reported that Mr. Pavereau, president of the Hanoi Chamber of Commerce in French Indochina, recently returned to the country and expressed his opinions to the Colonial Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and made suggestions on the situation of commerce in the Far East, which has aroused deep impressions. The members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies have also requested Mr. Pavereau to submit a report. Mr. Pavereau said that this return to the country is intended to express the appropriate views of Vietnamese merchants and provide various information to members of Congress to make it easier for them to complete their supervisory tasks. In terms of the Far Eastern situation, the war between China and Japan has been going on for eighteen months. Although the two sides have not formally declared war, all important ports in China have been occupied by the Japanese army. In terms of French law, since a state of war has not been formed between China and Japan, third countries have no reason to maintain neutrality and prohibit private arms sales. The Vietnamese government still allows merchants to transport coal and iron ore sand to Japan, for this reason. Since the transportation of Vietnamese goods to Japan is recognized as normal and legal, the Vietnamese government should give the same treatment to the transportation of goods to China. At a time when a railway is being planned between British Burma and Yunnan, China, if the Vietnamese authorities insist on their original policy, it is tantamount to strangling their commercial premises.

<h3>Japan's Environment Gradually Becomes Unfavorable; Observations of Various Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The current diplomatic and military position of Japan has recently been commented on by various German newspapers. Among them, the Frankfurter Zeitung said, "Judging from the various decisions recently taken by the United States government, Japan's environment is extremely pitiful." The United States authorities have now decided to set up fortifications on islands in the Pacific, so Japan is in danger of being militarily surrounded. Moreover, the actions of the United States are not limited to this. For example, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France sent a tough note to Japan. Secondly, the United Kingdom and the United States lent funds to China. All of this is clearly and obviously unfavorable to Japan. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung published a map indicating the various naval bases that the United States government intends to expand, and said, "According to the policy set by President Roosevelt, it can be seen that the United States intends to advance towards the southeast. This threat to Japan is particularly obvious. Tokyo is therefore greatly shaken. The will of the Washington government is to exert great pressure on Japan. This cannot be opposed by the American people. Since internal disputes in the Soviet Union have emerged one after another, leading to a weakening of national strength, its actions to attack various omnipotent countries, that is, the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact, have been replaced by the United States." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Times Warns Japan</h3>
<p>(London) A well-known commentator, writing under the pseudonym "Reviewer," published an article in the Sunday Times today, arguing that the terms offered by Japan to China are unacceptable to the United Kingdom and the United States. He said that the British note to Japan carefully explained that the United Kingdom did not insist on any treaty text. If Japan values the friendship between the two countries, this note actually gives it an opportunity to restore friendship. We should explain to the world that the cause of peace does not depend on the ability of any country or coalition of powers to preserve the past, present, and long-term political status. We may even be willing to concede that Japan is a natural partner of China, but Japan must completely change its attitude, helping rather than bullying the weak, and must replace the despotism of the warlords with higher ambitions. Japan should not ignore the close agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States on the Sino-Japanese issue, because the United Kingdom and the United States should do so for China and for themselves. Japan should not forget that the United States has always been extremely friendly to China and pays more attention to the Pacific than the Atlantic, just as the Monroe Doctrine places the United States in the position of the combined protector of Canada. The existence of the Philippines makes the United States a natural ally of the United Kingdom in Australia and Hong Kong to resist foreign aggression and protect national rights to resist tyrannical forces. The last paragraph of the article analyzes the position of Germany and Italy on the Far East in detail, acknowledging that they are allied countries, but their position is not very bright. The article concludes that the power of the Anti-Comintern Pact to establish bad habits is too weak and will disappoint one or two of its weaker participants. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Chen Guangfu Is About to Return Home</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) After Dr. Wang Zhengting, the former ambassador to the United States, arrived here, he told important people that the more China resists Japan, the more Japanese discrimination against American businesses in China will increase, and the more American aid to China will increase. It is heard that Chen Guangfu, who is currently stationed in the United States negotiating with the United States on financial and economic aid to China, will depart from the United States before the end of January to report the details of the negotiations to the Kuomintang government.

<h3>Japan's Trade with Hong Kong Plummets</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Today, the Statistics Bureau announced that trade between Japan and Hong Kong in 1938 plummeted, falling from second place to eighth place compared to 1937. In 1938, goods exported from Japan to Hong Kong totaled only 18,781,000 Hong Kong dollars, while in 1937 and 1936, they were both 58,000,000 Hong Kong dollars. In 1938, goods shipped from Hong Kong to Japan totaled 3,319,000 Hong Kong dollars, while in 1937, they were 19,780,000 Hong Kong dollars. (AP, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Foreign Trade in Yantai Sharply Decreases</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, since the Japanese authorities implemented regulations restricting imports and exports and foreign exchange regulations in Yantai on the 1st of this month, Yantai's foreign trade has sharply decreased. All matters such as wharves and port affairs in Yantai, which were previously handled by the Chinese Customs, have recently been taken over by the Japanese. (Special Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Public Groups in California, USA, Prevent Scrap Iron from Being Shipped to Japan; Set Up Picket Lines to Patrol the Coastline; Dockworkers Also Unanimously Refuse to Handle It</h3>
<p>Long Beach, California Thousands of picketers, composed of 55 organizations in California, including at least 1,500 overseas Chinese, are continuing to patrol the coastline to prevent scrap iron from being loaded onto Japanese ships. Dockworkers have also unanimously refused to handle it. The various groups participating in the picket work are now taking unified action with Stimson's "Association to Oppose Aiding Japanese Aggression." The picketers patrolling the coast are holding high flags denouncing Japanese aggression against China and demanding that the United States immediately ban the transportation of raw materials and munitions to Japan. As a result of the strict prevention by the picketers, as much as 12,000 tons of scrap iron that was to be shipped to Japan has not been transported. One Japanese ship and one Norwegian ship, which are unable to depart, are still staying here. The picketers have now brought cots and portable stoves to the coast in order to stay here for a long time and prevent the scrap iron from easily escaping. According to merchants involved in this trade, scrap iron cannot be used to make military equipment and is purely for Japanese public works construction. However, the picketers do not pay any attention to this kind of sophistry and still insist on their work of preventing shipment. (AP, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Raided Weinan Yesterday; Foreigners Extremely Outraged by the Bombing of Kuling</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Fifteen Japanese planes were discovered at Daqingguan at 9:50 a.m. on the 22nd and then flew southwest in batches. Xi'an immediately issued an alarm and took strict precautions. The Japanese planes passed through Chaoyi and Dali and invaded the airspace over Weinan County at 10:10 a.m., dropping more than 30 bombs in the vicinity of the West Gate and the train station of the city, destroying more than 50 civilian houses and killing and injuring more than 30 civilians. At 10:30 a.m., the Japanese planes flew northeast in batches. (Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The bombing of Kuling by Japanese planes on the 16th has caused great outrage among foreigners on the mountain. Yesterday, various groups, including the Methodist Church, the Anglican Church, and the China Inland Mission on the mountain, as well as Dr. Du, the representative of the United States, and Mr. Grelison (transliteration), the representative of the British, jointly telegraphed the province, requesting that it be forwarded to the American Embassy in Chongqing to report that the Japanese planes bombed indiscriminately and wantonly that day, dropping a total of more than 20 bombs. Dr. Du's residence was completely destroyed and British property was also damaged. (Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese reports, yesterday 16 Japanese planes flew to bomb various cities in northern Shaanxi, as well as Yan'an and Luochuan, injuring dozens of civilians. (AP, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the Japanese accusation that the British in Kuling were helping Chinese guerrillas, British officials said that they had not heard of it, saying that it was "extremely unlikely." Regarding the foreigners injured in Kuling, British and American officials did not know their names. It is known that No. 41, Yanhong Road (transliteration), the property of British missionaries, No. 44, the property of German missionaries, the houses of the American Methodist Mission, and the property of the American Church were all bombed, but it is still unknown who lives in and owns these houses.

<h3>Japanese Soldiers' War Weariness Is High; Saburo Yamada Writes an Anti-War Song; Arrested After Incident; Subjected to Torture</h3>
<p>Quanzhou According to a Japanese air defense radio squad leader, Saburo Yamada, in a certain foreign building in Xiamen, who graduated from university and worked in a bank, was conscripted into the army after the Japanese warlords launched their invasion of China. Yamada, as an intellectual youth, witnessed the tragedies of war and sang about anti-war. The matter was heard by the Japanese Naval Headquarters and he was recently arrested and subjected to torture. His anti-war song cursed the warlords with gnashing of teeth and hatred. The lyrics are sad and are translated and recorded as follows: "From the same race and culture, we were originally brothers, but the demon warlords have created bottomless hatred. Charge and slaughter, millions turned to ashes. Heaven, how can punishment not descend on the devil's hands? The blue sky and white sun shine on the earth, when will the blue clouds of world peace unfold? Countless blind eyes are unfolding in the midst of artillery fire. Beloved wife, we want to lean our heads together and be intimate, but this life will be difficult to see again." (Telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3>Spanish War Situation Changes; Barcelona in Danger; Rebel Army Advances Rapidly, Only 22 Miles from the City; Britain and France Confer on Possible Impact of the Situation</h3>
<p>(London) According to Burgos Radio today, the National Army, which is advancing rapidly towards the metropolis of Barcelona, has occupied the new village and the town of Gieltro, 22 miles from the metropolis of Barcelona in the southern section of the current battlefield. According to a Reuters special correspondent, after the National Army occupied the town of France, 22 miles west of Barcelona, it was able to control the Penedès region, the most agriculturally rich area of Catalonia. The vanguard sentry of the National Army division has now advanced to outside the village of La Pobla, and advancing southeast along the Noya River, has occupied an important bridgehead on the river. The government army was caught off guard, hurriedly retreated, and did not blow up the bridge. At the same time, according to news from Barcelona, civilians in various villages and towns near the front line and in Barcelona itself have now been ordered to rush to build fortifications. Barcelona was subjected to a total of eight air raids yesterday. The National Army's bombing paid great attention to the coastal highway leading to France. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>Lleida The Spanish National Army camped in the new village last night, which is only 20 miles from Barcelona. The new village is the last line of defense defended by 25,000 government troops. According to the latest report, this line of defense is the last reserve force of three divisions on the government side. The front line starts in Manresa, north of the coast, and stretches for 34 miles. It is now blocking the National Army, which is advancing along three highways to encircle it, but the National Army is progressing rapidly and has advanced to points less than 20 miles from its destination along the entire front line. Yesterday, the National Army Mixed Corps crossed the Belushi Pass, which is an ancient battlefield where Napoleon lost thousands of soldiers a hundred years ago. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) News last night said that men in Barcelona and cities along the Catalan line, regardless of age, have been drafted into the army to serve in the front lines. Trenches and barbed wire and other fortifications are being built day and night there, and local authorities are responsible for handling mobilization matters. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) As the National Army, led by General Franco, is rapidly advancing and approaching Barcelona, a diplomatic correspondent for the Observer has written an article discussing the possible impact of the victory of the Spanish National Army on German and Italian diplomacy. It is said that the British and French governments have discussed the possible impact of the National Army's victory, and both countries acknowledge its possible impact on France. Now, there is no need to fear that Germany and Italy will gain a strategic foothold in Spain, because it is generally believed that Franco's troops are the National Army, Hitler's troops are Germans, and Mussolini's troops are Italians. It is not even necessary to fear that Germany and Italy will provide aid to reconstruction and gain financial and economic power in Spain or supply military equipment to enable Spain to participate in the general arms race. However, the correspondent believes that it is possible that France, in addition to defending its border with Italy, will also need to defend its border with Spain. Germany will use this point as a motivating force for its diplomacy. Italy may use its "withdrawal" from Spain as a pretext to re-demand Tunis and Djibouti. Although Mussolini has given special guarantees to respect the status quo of the Mediterranean, the strategic interests of the United Kingdom and France in the entire Mediterranean may be affected.

<h3>Rebel Planes Attack; Air Battles Occur; Three Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Barcelona Last night's war report from the Spanish government army stated that the National Army, with the help of tanks, aircraft, and artillery, launched a fierce attack on the Catalonia front all day long. The enemy army lost two bombers and two fighter planes. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The National Army Air Force flew to bomb Barcelona several times yesterday. The most serious one was in the afternoon, with 15 three-engine bombers and several squadrons of fighters discovered over Barcelona, dropping a large number of bombs and causing significant damage. The exact number of deaths and injuries has not yet been ascertained. The cities of Valencia and Gandia were also attacked by the National Army Air Force. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Between Two Great Powers: Poland's Difficult Situation; Leaning Towards Germany or Russia on a Precarious Path; German Foreign Minister to Visit Warsaw</h3>
<p>Warsaw - According to reliable sources of the Haitong News Agency, the planned meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov is unlikely to materialize. Political figures believe that Poland's motive for abandoning this meeting is to preserve the friendship between Germany and Poland and to avoid giving Germany the impression that Poland is approaching the Soviet Union, which would create a negative impression. The Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union was ordered to inform Litvinov of Foreign Minister Beck's recent remarks in Munich and to explain the significance of Ribbentrop's upcoming visit to Poland, in order to avoid misunderstandings on the Soviet side. Like a daughter-in-law caught between two mothers-in-law, Poland's daily situation is indeed similar. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to arrive in Poland on the 25th of this month. Foreign Minister Beck is currently suffering from sciatica, and it is hoped that he will recover in time to host the reception. Officials here recently declared that since the European War, Ribbentrop will be the first German Foreign Minister to visit Warsaw. It is reported that he will be accompanied by about twenty members of the Foreign Ministry staff. The Polish authorities have prepared a grand welcome for him. It is also said that the 25th of this month marks the fifth anniversary of the signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Ribbentrop's visit will not only prove that this agreement retains full value, but also demonstrate the suitability of Poland's current foreign policy to the environment. Polish opposition figures have previously criticized Foreign Minister Beck's policies, but now that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is visiting, it can be said that this is a major victory for Foreign Minister Beck, and the opposition's criticism will inevitably collapse. Informed sources said that Foreign Minister Beck had just visited Berchtesgaden in Germany earlier this month for talks with Chancellor Hitler, and no new factors have occurred internationally since then. Therefore, the scope of talks between Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the Polish authorities will not be too broad. In addition, many foreign newspapers have said that the German Foreign Minister's visit will likely involve discussions with the Polish authorities on the issue of border revisions, but local newspapers have denied this, saying that it is purely speculative and not credible. The current borders of Eastern European countries will become more stable due to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit. As for 1939 being the year of colonies, there are indeed many in Poland who hold this view. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>German-Czech Talks</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to authoritative sources, the meeting between Chancellor Hitler and the Czech Foreign Minister did not discuss any major issues such as the German-Czech customs union, Czech participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact, or Ukrainian autonomy. This meeting only considered the Czech government's current main political issues and explained Germany's position on each issue. Political figures said that Germany's position was clearly defined on each issue. It is widely believed that the issue of anti-Soviet propaganda throughout the Czech Republic may have been raised for discussion. Germany hopes that Czech internal unity and stability will make it easier to establish relations between Germany and the Czech Republic. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italy Encourages Hungary and Yugoslavia to Reconcile; Ciano's Diplomatic Success</h3>
<p>(Rome) After Foreign Minister Ciano visited Yugoslavia and repeatedly urged the country to reconcile with Hungary, the Italian Daily, a semi-official organ, reported, "Yugoslavia and Hungary will soon sign a non-aggression and friendship agreement, and convene an economic conference to develop bilateral trade relations. Hungary will then follow suit and dispel suspicions and make peace with Romania. It can be seen that the relationship between the countries of the Little Entente and the Rome-Berlin Axis has recently become closer." (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

He then returned to the capital of Yugoslavia by special train last night and is scheduled to return to Rome tonight. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Lenin's Death; 15th Anniversary</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A memorial meeting for the 15th anniversary of Lenin's death was held on the evening of the 21st at the Bauer School Theater here. Representatives from party and Soviet organizations at all levels, Stakhanov and shock workers from various factories in the city, and representatives from scientific, industrial, literary, and artistic circles attended, totaling thousands of people. The theater was completely packed. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Zhdanov, Yezhov, Dimitrov, Beria, Shkiryatov, Bulganin, Shvernik, and Yugoslavsky and other dignitaries took the podium at six o'clock. The entire audience stood up in unison and paid warm respects to Stalin, the successor to Lenin's cause. After Zhdanov delivered the opening speech, the entire audience stood up in silence to mourn Lenin. Finally, Shcherbakov, Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party Committee, reported on the historical victories achieved by the Soviet Union in the fifteen years since Lenin's death.

<h3>Expansion of German and Italian Influence; World Peace Threatened; The United States Has a Deep Understanding of the Situation; Military Buildup is Imminent</h3>
<p>(Washington) Political figures here, in view of the recent situation in Germany, mostly believe that there is a chance that the European situation will become dangerous again. However, opinions differ as to the direction of Germany's expansion of its influence. Most people, including U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt, believe that the Soviet authorities will temporarily abandon their "eastward policy" and make direct overtures to the democratic countries of the West. The "Christian Science Monitor" said that, generally speaking, American public opinion can ignore Germany's expansion into Central Europe, but one point cannot be ignored, namely, the threat that the Rome-Berlin Axis can pose to the United States. In other words, if the Spanish Nationalists win, the two omnipotent countries, Germany and Italy, will be able to gain a foothold in the Atlantic, which will have a significant impact on the security of the United States. This is also the reason why the government authorities have proposed a huge national defense plan. Generally speaking, the U.S. diplomatic authorities firmly believe that public opinion's understanding of the situation has become increasingly profound. Although the amount of defense spending requested by President Roosevelt from Congress is huge, the pacifists no longer seem to have sufficient power to prevent its passage. Officials commented on the proposal to fortify Guam in the central Pacific, saying that this move has political significance, as President Roosevelt and the State Department want to use it to show that their resolute policy towards aggressor countries has been victorious.

<h3>U.S. President Convenes Senior Military Officers to Discuss Military Expansion Plan; May Suggests Training 300,000 Young Men; Hepburn Believes Guam Needs to be Fortified</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news here today, Representative May, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, will soon suggest to Congress a bill stipulating the training of 300,000 young men. It is widely believed that May's bill has the support of the War Department and the House Military Affairs Committee. The bill stipulates that these 300,000 young men should receive five hours of training per week and must also be responsible for relief work. At the same time, President Roosevelt convened a meeting of senior military officers to discuss a plan for rapid military expansion. The White House claimed that this meeting was purely a "routine meeting," but those who attended the meeting included Secretary of War Woodring, Undersecretary of War Johnson, Chief of Staff Craig, and other senior military officers. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Republican Senator Hepburn, he firmly believes that Republican senators will unanimously approve President Roosevelt's naval plan. According to Hepburn, if the United States wants to maintain its position as a strong power in the Pacific and wants to provide adequate protection to the Philippines, then the fortification of Guam is imminent. "If we can arm Guam, then Japan will not be able to attack the Philippines, and the United States' position as a strong power in the Pacific will not be lost." Hepburn did not pay attention to Japan's opposition and claimed that he would soon propose a bill in this session of Congress to grant U.S. citizenship to the natives of Guam. He also said that Guam was already armed, but it was dismantled due to the conclusion of the Washington Treaty. Now that Japan has violated the treaty by building defenses on mandated islands, the United States should follow suit and take the same action. Hepburn said that it was a great mistake that the United States did not annex the Gaoshao Islands in the equatorial zone after the Philippine-American War, because these islands were later transferred to the Germans, and after the Great War, they were transferred to the Japanese, which made the United States' position in the Pacific more threatened.

<p>(German Consul General in San Francisco to be Appointed by Wiedemann; U.S. Expresses Displeasure)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. side was quite displeased to hear that Captain Wiedemann, a confidant of German Chancellor Hitler, had been appointed as Consul General in San Francisco. It is said that Wiedemann served as a company commander in the European War, and Chancellor Hitler was his former subordinate, and their relationship was very close. Recently, he has been repeatedly ordered by Chancellor Hitler to carry out various secret missions. Therefore, these kinds of things are probably not sympathized with by the American people. It is even rumored that Captain Wiedemann will succeed Dieckhoff as the ambassador to the United States, which is truly surprising. Captain Wiedemann's name was mentioned in the New York State Court's recent trial of a German National Socialist Party spy case, which shows that his behavior is not without suspicion. Compared with Ambassador Dieckhoff, who is a professional diplomat and whose personality is sympathized with by the American side, it is impossible to speak of them in the same breath.

<h3>U.S. and France Establish Temporary Agreement to Open Regular Air Service</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a press release stating that the United States and France have reached a temporary agreement to open a regular transatlantic air route between New York and Marseille, with the Portuguese Azores as a landing station in the middle. The first flight is scheduled for March 15th of this year, taking 20 to 24 hours for the entire journey. Both sides will also conduct negotiations in the near future to establish a long-term formal agreement to replace the current temporary agreement. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the temporary agreement between Britain and France to open a regular transatlantic air service, political figures here recently commented that the French government's measures are quite satisfactory. By the spring of this year, this air route can be opened to carry passengers, goods, and mail. However, it has not been determined whether it will be operated by one American airline or by several. Among them, Pan American Airways and American Export Airlines reached an agreement in October of last year to divide the business scope of the North Atlantic air route (i.e., Northern Europe and the Scandinavian Peninsula are assigned to Pan American Airways, and the Mediterranean coastal countries and North Africa, as well as West Asia up to the Persian Gulf, are assigned to American Export Airlines). Now, according to the temporary agreement between the United States and France, the two companies will probably jointly operate it. It is reported that the round-trip flights will be no less than four times a week. Political figures here also said regarding this matter that now that the United States and the democratic countries of Europe have completed their air transportation lines, the significance of this air route will certainly be seen as significant if conflicts occur in Europe in the future.

<h3>French Government Appoints New Far East Fleet Commander</h3>

<h3>U.S. Naval and Air Force Maneuvers in the Atlantic; Beginning at the End of this Month for Two Months; Testing the Strength of Defending the New Continent</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency (Washington Aviation Correspondence) The ink of the "Lima Declaration" signed at the Eighth Pan-American Conference was not yet dry, and the U.S. fleet had already sailed to the Caribbean Sea to conduct large-scale exercises, in order to give the new doctrine of "American Continental Solidarity" a significant meaning. These naval exercises will begin at the end of this month and end in mid-March. The main force of the U.S. Navy, including 140 warships of all classes, 500 aircraft, and 53,000 officers and men, under the command of Admiral Bloch, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, will participate in the event. The exercise area extends from Norfolk, Virginia, to the coast of Brazil in South America, covering an area of 4,000,000 square miles, including the West Indies and various strategic locations in the mid-Atlantic. Among them, the Panama Canal Zone is of particular importance. According to the planned program, the exercise fleet is divided into black and white teams. The white fleet, as the attacking side, commanded by Rear Admiral Giffen, attempts to approach the southeastern coast of the United States or the West Indies and gain a foothold, in order to attack the Panama Canal. The black fleet, as the defending side, commanded by Rear Admiral Dortch, has the task of preventing the attacking side from landing. The procedure for this exercise was announced by the authorities before the signing of the "Lima Declaration," because the Panama Canal is the key to the U.S. Navy and is related to the defense of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Central American countries, whether they agree with it or not, must in fact be included in the scope of the continental defense plan.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the exercises, the Pacific Fleet departed from San Diego and San Pedro, California, at the beginning of this month, sailed through the Panama Canal, and headed for the Caribbean Sea. U.S. naval policy has always been based on maintaining a "Great Ocean Fleet" to take into account the defense of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Therefore, the speed at which this fleet sails through the Panama Canal is a key factor in determining victory or defeat in future foreign operations. This is the reason why this exercise places special emphasis on the canal zone.</p>
<p>Moreover, the location of this year's naval exercises, the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea, was not chosen by chance. It is safe to say that it is related to the evolution of the European situation. In the past few years, the U.S. Navy has mostly conducted exercises in the Pacific, from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the islands in the central Pacific in the west and the west coast of the United States in the east. Its hypothetical target was obviously Japan. This year, it suddenly changed to conducting exercises in the Atlantic, which does not mean that the threat from Japan has diminished, but rather that the situation in the Atlantic has changed. Because the Axis powers are actively expanding their naval, air, and land forces, and they are trying to occupy a stronger position in the markets of Latin American countries, the importance of the Atlantic issue has become equal to the Pacific issue, which contains the crisis of war.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is well aware of these external threats and has decided to issue representations in various ways to warn the Axis powers: diplomatically, to promote the "Lima Declaration"; economically and financially, to decide to assist the Latin American countries; politically, to deal with Germany in extremely harsh terms, such as recalling the ambassador to Germany because of Germany's anti-Semitic movement; and militarily, to hold this large-scale exercise to promote American continental solidarity. Judging from this, this year's U.S. naval exercises can be regarded as an expression of dealing with attacks from the East.</p>
<p>According to repeated official statements, this exercise is only to implement a plan that the naval authorities have long planned and has nothing to do with foreign affairs. However, according to the government's national defense plan submitted to Congress, Atlantic defense must be strengthened to an unprecedented level, and air force strength must be increased to a level that fears no provocation. This large-scale exercise shows that the United States intends to prepare to extend its powerful power in a decisive way in the current international disputes.</p>
<h3>Germany Develops Foreign Trade with Central and Eastern Europe and South America; Barter Policy Expected to be Implemented; Competition from Britain and the United States is Inevitable</h3>
<p>(London) The recent comments from business circles here on the fact that German Economics Minister Funk has taken over Dr. Schacht's concurrent post as President of the Central Bank are that competition between Britain and Germany in trade with Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and South America will intensify. Because Funk has always strived to promote the policy of barter trade, what he will seek to advance in the future will probably be nothing more than two things: (1) The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have mostly become German vassals, and Funk will promote trade with these countries based on the barter trade policy; (2) To promote business relations with the countries of South America and increase German influence, while excluding British and American goods from the South American market, starting from this policy. If so, Britain will naturally have to abandon its plan to improve trade relations with Germany. For example, the Federation of British Industries originally planned to negotiate with the German Industry Association to discuss the distribution of markets everywhere, and Commerce Secretary Stanley once said that the cabinet would "morally endorse" this issue. However, since the current situation is special, the only thing to do is to advise the Federation of British Industries to abandon the negotiation proposal. It is not safe to only do that, and the British government should also rely on the Export Credits Guarantee Department Expansion Act to vigorously increase export credit lending, so that British exporters can compete with German businessmen in foreign markets. Such responses are all within expectations. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Delivers Speech; Ridicules Anti-Fascists</h3>
<p>(Rome) Premier Mussolini recently gave a speech to thousands of farmers at the Argentina Theater here, repeatedly referring to the tense situation between France and Italy in sarcastic terms. He said, "If France is stubborn, then Italy can be even more stubborn." He also said, "I said in September of last year that our country's enemies were too stupid to be a cause for concern. To this day, I still believe that this statement is not false." He also said, "If I were to repeat to you the abuse of fascism by a certain country's newspapers, you would all laugh heartily, and the laughter would shatter all the glass windows in the capital city beyond the Alps." He also said, "The anti-fascist attitude of foreign countries is incorrigible and not worth worrying about, but they are completely ignorant of the entire Italian problem, and their stupidity is incomparable." He continued with such remarks, which were endless. In conclusion, he unreservedly promoted Italy's current agricultural policy. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Stimson Writes to Hull to Rescind Arms Embargo on Spain</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently stated that he has received a letter from former Secretary of State Stimson requesting that the order to embargo arms to Spain be rescinded. Stimson is currently on Long Island and recently gave an interview to Havas News Agency here by telephone, stating that he has long believed that Spain is a battlefield between dictatorship and democracy, and most American celebrities have urged him to come forward to uphold justice for the Spanish Republican government. However, due to his ill health, he has not been able to do so. He has recently written to Secretary of State Hull, asking him to rescind the arms embargo. Stimson recently joined prominent figures from all walks of life in the United States to form the "Do Not Help Japan's Aggression" Committee. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the matter of rescinding the order prohibiting the transportation of arms to Spain, a reliable source stated that Stimson also stated that the current policy of the U.S. government has disadvantaged the Spanish Republican government and needs to be corrected urgently. According to American law, President Roosevelt originally had the power to rescind this embargo without seeking the consent of Congress, so he requested that the Secretary of State convey this intention to the President.

<h3>Lin Bosheng Attacked in Hong Kong, Slightly Injured, Not Life-Threatening</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence. After Shanghai China Daily manager Lin Bosheng left Shanghai for Hong Kong, he immediately became the manager of the South China Daily and the behind-the-scenes host of the Weilan Bookstore. He also represented Wang Jingwei in contacting various parties, making him quite busy. Lin usually traveled between the Weilan Bookstore on the seventh floor of the Queen's Road Central building and the South China Daily, often entering and leaving major hotels and inns with relevant figures, engaging in activities. Since Lin and Mei Shiping jointly published a telegram in Wang Jingwei's name seeking peace, the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong were angered by Wang's traitorous pursuit of peace and thus viewed Lin as a traitor. However, Lin Bosheng was unaware of the need to restrain himself, writing articles in the South China Daily every day attacking the authorities and promoting the traitorous theory of seeking peace through humiliation. Therefore, he was attacked on the afternoon of the 17th. At around 2 PM that afternoon, Lin went from his residence to the Lincoln's Cafeteria on Des Voeux Road to have afternoon tea with a friend. At 5:10 PM, after finishing tea, he stepped out of the restaurant. Just as he crossed the exceptionally busy road and walked to the veranda in front of Watson's Pharmacy on the opposite side, several young men dressed as workers suddenly appeared to Lin's left and right. One of them immediately pulled out an iron file and struck Lin's head violently. Lin, because he was wearing a felt hat, was not seriously injured and immediately ran forward while shouting loudly. However, the attackers continued to pursue him relentlessly. Another person struck Lin's head again with an iron rod, and the one holding the iron file also forcefully slashed at Lin's neck. Lin, suffering from these blows, collapsed to the ground, with blood streaming down from his neck and head. At this time, Chinese and Western pedestrians on the road gathered to watch, and some frantically blew police whistles. However, the assailants calmly continued to violently beat Lin several more times. Because two Westerners stepped forward to apprehend them, they scattered and fled. One of them, unable to escape in time, was captured by an approaching British soldier. At this point, the police also dispatched a car to the scene to apprehend the perpetrators and summoned an ambulance by phone to take Lin to Maryknoll Hospital. The captured suspect was taken back to the police station.</p>
<p>After Lin was sent to the hospital, doctors cleaned the wounds, and he gradually regained consciousness. An X-ray examination revealed that Lin suffered injuries to his head, neck, arms, and other parts, and there was a small fracture in his skull. His eyes were also injured, but because the injuries were not to vital areas, his life was not in danger. According to doctors, he will be able to be discharged from the hospital in three weeks.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities, before the truth of the case is clear, do not want to disclose the details to the public but have offered a reward of two hundred and fifty dollars to strictly apprehend the perpetrators. As for the suspect Chen, who was arrested, it is said that he is twenty-two years old and works as a painter. He strongly denies the attack on Lin. The police authorities, for the sake of prudence, have temporarily detained Chen for further investigation and plan to have Lin personally identify him after he recovers and is discharged from the hospital. Lin is thirty-three years old, of medium build, wears Western suits and carries a cane, and his clothing is quite luxurious. He once studied in Paris. When Wang Jingwei arrived in Paris, Lin contacted students studying in France to hold a welcome meeting, thus developing a relationship with Wang and later becoming a second-rate celebrity within Wang's faction.</p>

<h3>Xinghua Telephone Poles and Wires Destroyed by Ice, Communication Severed for Several Days</h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence. Since water flowed down from the west of this county, it has been a vast ocean, and the accumulated water has not receded to this day. The day before, the weather turned bitterly cold, and the river formed an ice floe. On the night of the 8th, it was swayed by a gentle breeze, destroying the telegraph and telephone poles and wires on various routes within the county, completely stopping communication. Local agencies and people felt inconvenienced in communicating with each other, and what was most worrying was that there might be accidents that could not be known. The Telegraph and Telephone Bureau, therefore, considered the matter of great importance and immediately ordered its employees to go to various routes to investigate and retrieve [the damaged equipment]. According to the investigation, the telegraph lines (from Xinghua to Gaoyou) were about 80% damaged. The Xingyan line (Xinghua to Yancheng) was 40% damaged. The Xing Sha line (Xinghua to Shagou, Yancheng) was 50% damaged. The Xingding line (Xinghua to Dingxi, Dongtai), although damaged, could still be repaired. The wooden poles and lines on the remaining routes were missing, and it was necessary to replace them. It would be difficult to restore them in a short time. The bureau has already sent personnel to various routes to retrieve and gather [the damaged equipment] and has submitted a request to the county government to order the township chiefs and military and police agencies stationed in the townships to assist in the matter and reported to the Construction Department for instructions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Rugao Invade Shili墩, Repelled by Chinese Troops</h3>
<p>Rugao Correspondence. After suffering heavy losses in the battle of Kongjiaqiao, the Japanese troops in Rugao have been actively stepping up training in an attempt to retaliate. At about 6 AM on the 7th of this month, more than 300 Japanese and puppet troops, carrying two steel cannons and light machine guns, invaded the Shili墩 position of the Chinese troops in two routes. One route of a hundred people attacked the front along the north bank of the Xiaoxi River. The second route of more than two hundred people detoured from the south of the Xiaoxi River to the rear of the Chinese troops, planning to cross the river at Shili墩 and join the first route to attack, attempting to occupy Jiali Town in one fell swoop. The Chinese troops destroyed the orange beam area around Shili墩 and used fierce firepower to prevent the Japanese troops from crossing the river. They also organized their forces and advanced to meet the Japanese troops on the front, relying on strong fortifications to launch attacks from all sides. The Japanese troops were unable to resist and retreated. The Chinese troops chased to Wuli墩 and then returned. In this battle, it is estimated that one hundred Japanese troops were killed.</p>
<h3>Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government Organizes Puppet Road Protection Association, Obeying the Japanese Army's Intentions</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence. The puppet provincial government recently received an order from the Japanese army to actively organize a puppet road protection association, soliciting people from all walks of life to join. The guerrillas on the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line are extremely active, often demolishing bridges and roads. The Japanese army used high-pressure tactics, ordering the puppet provincial government to plan protection. It is reported that the puppet association is ready to be established, and the founding meeting will be held soon. There are very few Japanese troops stationed in the urban and rural areas of Wuxian County. Bunkers have been installed at each gate to prevent guerrilla attacks. Because the guerrillas are active in the western suburbs, the Japanese troops are extremely vigilant. Because the Japanese troops often harass various places in the county, Zhuang Ding teams have been formed one after another to defend the locality.</p>
<h3>Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou Landlords' Rent Collection Problems, Guerilla Activities' Restraint, Japanese and Puppet Economies Affected</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence. According to the usual peacetime custom, rural households collect rent from tenant farmers, and it must be completed every year by the winter solstice festival. The current situation is particularly special, and the issue of rent collection is far from easy. I still remember the land rent two years ago, compared to the three counties of Suzhou, Changshu, and Wuxi, Suzhou was the best, and Changshu was second. This year is very different. Here is an overview of the rent collection situation in the three counties.</p>
<p>Changshu's land rent is best in the east of the county. The southwest of the county is less good because it is close to the Nanbei Bridge area of ​​Wuxian County. The collection method is mostly that the majority of landlords automatically set up cooperative collection in the countryside, called a certain rent collection station. Each landlord recommends a director to handle rent collection affairs. They do not accept any orders or have any organization. The discounted price is set at six yuan per stone of rice. The calculation and promotion are also very smooth. By the end of the lunar year, various rent collection stations had collected more than 100,000 yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Wuxi's land rent has recently been collected best in the southeast of the county. The collection method is still that landlords collect as usual. Each district has a rent collection office. The discounted price is seven yuan and one jiao per stone of rice, including wheat rent. Tenant farmers and landlords who are usually friendly still take the initiative to weave rents as usual. By the end of the year, the county had collected about 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Suzhou's land rent is collected by a puppet "Rent and Tax Collection Bureau" jointly established by the puppet side and shameless landlords. The puppet branch has fourteen offices, but in fact, only the offices in Mudu and Hengjing have collected more than 30,000 yuan. The most affected was Li Chaoyuan, the puppet district chief of Nanbei Bridge, who was shot and killed by guerrillas. The puppet officials of various puppet branches were afraid to go, and Zhou Huaixuan, the puppet branch chief of Nanbei Bridge, saw that the situation was not good and resigned immediately, leaving only a stoker to take care of the empty house. Even if tenant farmers went to the bureau to pay rent, no one dared to accept it. Therefore, it is said that the rent tax will be collected uniformly on December 1st last year, which is all a deception. On January 10th of this year, Yun Quanwang became the puppet chief of the Nanbei Bridge puppet branch. He wanted to urgently collect rent, exploit the peasants, please the puppet side, and was afraid that guerrillas would attack, sending them to their deaths in vain, so he just made a show. The puppet side has no concrete plan for this thorny issue, and they wanted to ask the Japanese side to send Japanese and puppet troops to the countryside for protection. In fact, the rural areas are vast, and it is difficult to station troops in each village one by one, so there is no specific way to collect rent in Suzhou, and the economic income of the Japanese puppets has been seriously affected.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Suffering Heavy Losses in Various Places, Wounded Soldiers Arriving in Shanghai in a Steady Stream, Zhongshan Hospital Receiving 200 Patients Daily, Healed Soldiers Must Leave to Return to Their Units</h3>
<p>The mainland newspaper reports that according to reliable sources, two hundred wounded Japanese soldiers are transported daily from Hongkou to the Nanjing Zhongshan Hospital across from Qiqi Road. Trucks full of wounded soldiers pass through the Bund of the two concessions and enter Nanjing. Whether these wounded soldiers were injured by guerrillas in the port area or transported from the Japanese army hospital in Hongkou is not certain. Japanese wounded soldiers began to be transported to Nanjing more than a week ago and continue to be transported constantly.</p>
<p>A Large Batch of Wounded Soldiers Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, from the Yangshupu area, the Japanese Red Cross ship Yoshino Maru arrived with a batch of wounded soldiers from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After arriving at the port, five large trucks prepared by the Japanese side, all covered with white Red Cross cloth awnings, were used by those resembling engineers to carry the soldiers from the ship onto the trucks on canvas beds. The soldiers were transported in batches to the field hospital set up by the Japanese in eastern Shanghai for treatment. From morning to noon, the trucks shuttled back and forth. The transportation was completed at around 2 PM. All the corpses and ashes of Japanese soldiers who had died in various hospitals in the port area were loaded onto large trucks and collapsed trucks at around 3 PM yesterday afternoon and transported to the pier to be loaded onto the water disease ship converted from the Osaka merchant ship and transported back to Japan.</p>
<p>Healed Soldiers Must Fight Again</p>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Garrison Headquarters recently noted that the number of wounded soldiers being treated in the rear wounded soldier hospitals and field hospitals set up in the Pudong, Puxi, and Nanshi areas is quite large, and that many of the wounded soldiers have recovered. As the front-line war is in full swing and there is an urgent need for reinforcements, more than 20 members of the Matsui慰問团 were dispatched in military vehicles in batches over the past two days to the Shanghai Hospital on Meizhou Road in Yangshupu, the Zhongshan Hospital in front of the Maple Bridge, and the temporary wounded soldier hospitals set up in Hongqiao Wujiagang. The rear hospitals and field hospitals are resolutely comforting the soldiers and clarifying the number of wounded soldiers who have been healed in order to depart regularly to return to their units and augment the military force.</p>
<h3>Japan Expanding Police Power in Hongkou District, More Than 60 Japanese Police Officers Transferred from Domestic Japan, Five More Police Sub-Stations Established in Hongkou</h3>
<p>The negotiations on the opening of Hongkou have been delayed for more than a year because the Japanese side has no sincerity in returning police powers, so there is still no hope of a resolution. It is learned that the Japanese side has recently expanded the powers of Japanese police in the northeast districts of Hongkou. In addition to significantly increasing the number of Japanese consular police officers, one branch has been added to Yangshupu Road, Wusong Road, North Sichuan Road, Shigaota Road, and Dixiwei Road. More than 60 police officers have been transferred from Japan to take charge of their affairs. This move clearly has the suspicion of replacing the patrol room in exercising police powers. The concession authorities are paying attention to it.</p>
<h3>Street Refugees Eager for Shelter, Letters of Appeal Sent to This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Since the war, displaced compatriots from various places have come to Shanghai one after another. Due to difficult living conditions, more than 50,000 people have been sheltered in the two concessions. Although the Relief Association has raised funds in many ways, winter is approaching, and there is a need for funds for supplies and winter clothing. It is now learned that the refugee camp being built on Dunxin Road covers an area of ​​more than ten mu and has schools, bath rooms, and medical facilities, which can accommodate about 9,000 people. People are being moved in one after another.</p>
<p>Living in the Open Air, Words Cannot Express Their Hardship</p>
<p>However, in addition to the refugees who have been sheltered, there are still many refugees on the streets. Most of these people came to Shanghai because their hometowns were unsafe and their homes were destroyed, and they had no means of earning a living. The shelter has not been able to accommodate as many as possible, resulting in people having to live in the open air in the bustling market. The citizens of Shanghai should provide assistance to prevent them from freezing and starving. This newspaper received a letter yesterday from a named street refugee, with sincerity and earnest words. Here is the original letter: "To the Editor of Shen Bao, I am writing respectfully. We refugees are from a fallen hometown, our homes are destroyed, our population is scattered, and no fewer than hundreds of thousands of people have come to Shanghai to take refuge. All rely on refugee shelters to nurture them, and there are still countless people who have not been sheltered. Living in the open air is unbearably difficult. Benevolence and universal relief are still ailments of Yao and Shun, but your gentlemen have a compassionate heart. May I have this letter published in the newspaper for publicity, or may I ask your newspaper to send a letter to the refugee shelter to shelter and relieve all the street refugees. A thought of benevolence will extend to the scales and armor. If we do not treat them with contempt or pity, then a drop of Yangzhi nectar is no different from releasing life in the lotus pond. Planting virtue is boundless, and the rewards are also infinite."</p>
<p>Order Disrupted in the Fallen Area</p>
<p>After the fall of the mainland, order has disappeared. This newspaper yesterday received a letter from Tang Naiwo, who recently came to Shanghai from Danyang to take refuge. The situation there is unspeakable. Land property rights have been seized, etc. This phenomenon is not unique to Danyang. It has become commonplace in various places along the two lines. There are many painful histories, and it is enough to see that the fallen area is already unbearable for the people today.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Groups Held a Wang Yiting Memorial Service Yesterday, The Assembly Officially Decided to Confer the Title of Duke Qinda to Wang, and Organized a Permanent Memorial Research Committee</h3>
<p>The Zhenji Committee, the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee, and more than 100 other organizations in the city held a Wang Yiting memorial service at the Huzhou Guild Hall on Guizhou Road at 2 PM yesterday. All charitable organizations flew flags at half-mast yesterday to express their grief. The Assembly officially decided to confer the title of Duke "Qinda" to Wang and organized a permanent memorial research committee to develop a long-term memorial plan. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The Assembly venue was set up in the Chen Yingzhi Memorial Hall of the Huzhou Guild Hall. The Wang family's memorial hall was located in the center of the north end. Wang's portrait was placed in the middle, with the party and national flags hanging on the upper corners. In front of the stage, a large archway of plain silk was erected, topped with the eight characters "Two Generations of Perfect People" and "Admirable Example." On both sides of the archway were elegiac couplets sent by Chairman Jiang and Kong Xiangxi. From the gate along the aisle to the surroundings of the venue, elegiac couplets and banners from various central ministries, committees, and circles were hung everywhere, making it extremely solemn and respectful. Yesterday, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial service, including Yan Huiqing, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Li Guiyong, Lin Kanghou, Xu Xiaochu, Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, and representatives from 115 organizations, including the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The scene was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Details of the Memorial Service</p>
<p>The memorial service began at 2 PM yesterday. First, the orchestra of the Shanghai Orphanage and the Puyi Training Institute played mourning music. Wen Lanzi delivered the opening speech, followed by the memorial ceremony. Everyone stood in silence, Shi Shengzhi burned incense, Chu Qiaqing offered flowers, Wang Tongsun, Zhu Xieshen, and Lu Jiesun read the memorial text, and then Fan and Mingde, the two girls' schools, sang a memorial song. Zhao Jinqing reported on Wang's life story, and Ye Bo, Guan Jiongzhi, and Lin Kanghou delivered eulogies one after another. The Fengshi ceremony was then held. The Shanghai Orphanage sang a memorial plan again. Finally, Wang's sons, Mengnan, Shuxian, Jimei, and his son-in-law, Lu Chuanlin, delivered thank-you speeches.</p>
<p>Bestowing the Title of Qinda</p>
<p>When Lin Kanghou delivered his eulogy, he said that although Mr. Yiting had already been titled "Minghui" by various groups in the Huzhou region, this was a local title. Today, the Zhenji Committee, the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee, and other organizations in the city are holding a grand memorial service here, and another title should be bestowed to show solemnity. After the meeting agreed, the presidium was asked to discuss and determine the title "Qinda." After unanimous adoption by the meeting, the Fengshi ceremony was held. Everyone stood in silence, the chairman respectfully held the position of "Mr. Qinda" for worship, played music, burned incense, offered flowers, read blessings, bowed three times, "Mr. Qinda"'s family thanked them, and finally the chairman group pushed Zhang Jusheng to respectfully hold the position of "Mr. Qinda" and gave it to the family to take back for worship. The ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Long-Term Commemoration</p>
<p>The conference decided that Mr. Wang Yiting's life career has been meritorious to society and the country and that there must be a permanent memorial plan to pass on for a long time. It was decided to organize a permanent memorial research committee and first appoint Wen Lanting, Chu Qiaqing, Shi Shengzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Guan Jiongzhi, Qin Yanqi, Zhang Jusheng, Zhu Xieshen, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Yinjiang, Liu Hanyi, Pang Laichen, Gao Hanqing, Wu Dongmai, Xie Jiaqian, Xu Caichen, Yuan Ying Master, Zhang Lanping, and Xu Qianlin as members. The list of members will be increased later.</p>
<p>Assembly Memorial Text</p>
<p>On January 22nd, the 28th year of the Republic of China, representatives of various participating organizations, Yan Huiqing, Shi Zhaoji, Ye Erkai, Shen Wei, Zhang Yuanji, Shi Zhaozeng, Qin Xitian, Yu Hede, Wen Lanting, Liu Hanyi, Huang Qinglan, Lin Zujin, Guan Jiongzhi, Zhao Xi'en, etc., respectfully present incense and flowers to the spirit of Wang Yiting Jushi, saying, "Alas, the Benevolent One established religion, the beginning of all good, exhausting the body without hesitation, and treating enemies and relatives equally. Merit and virtue can save fire, and Paramita must come first. Transforming karma into wonderful trees and ascending to the shore of the Tao is Nirvana. In the past, the ancestors who inherited the teachings of the Benevolent One were mostly like this. Today, I, the great lay Buddhist Yiting, have been gifted with wisdom since childhood, widely practiced benevolence, had sincere inner behavior, and solemn external appearance. In Buddhism, he was able to transcend the expression of words and take the protection of all living beings as his heart. Observing his management of himself, the love, hate, jealousy, and clinging pursuit of worldly affairs were swept away. And when he treats others, he encourages personal virtue, is careful in official duties, and works tirelessly forgetting sleep, food, cold, and heat. Whoever has even a bit of benefit to others must do his best, without favoring or avoiding based on one's own gains and losses. He is truly one who unties the karma and spreads the great vow. Even the remaining art of calligraphy and painting is magnificent and brilliant. One paper is circulated, and everyone fights for the wise and noble. The small deeds that are in people's eyes and ears cannot be exhausted by paper and ink. Today, colleagues set up a meeting to commemorate and mourn, and its words are, "Taking benevolence as one's responsibility, continuing until death, the source of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism is inherently the same. Duke dwells in the market, deeply in tune with Buddhist principles, many generations of nurturing, Bodhi seeds, lotus heart pure and clean, not muddy, Turbid calamities are entangled, not worrying about mundane ties, saving disasters and difficulties, with a broad coat covered, far and near are the same, praise and sound compete. From Duke's point of view, we just do our best. The emptiness is serene, without worry or joy. The environment does not change the heart, and the heart has nothing to rely on. Heaven and earth are thatched huts, and all things are one finger. Returning from the sea, arriving safely, pure vows, thorough source of law, letting go and returning to the west, liberating the complex commission, the great view of a wise man, originally without birth or death, both monks and laity are sad, the capital is shocked and far and near, those who come later will deeply admire, Shangxiang."</p>
<p>Cilian Memorial Text</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Council Memorial Text states, "On January 22nd, the 28th year of the Republic of China, Huang Qinglan of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Council and representatives of various member organizations respectfully offer mountain delicacies and field wine to the spirit of Mr. Wang Yiting, saying, "Fan Da Ting is a masterpiece, as early as the mountains and rivers showed strangeness, pregnant with spirituality in Zhoupu, hunting for classics and history in the sea, learning new knowledge and retranslating, following Tao Yi's pursuit of the times, both accumulating and being able to disperse, grieving the wind and trees and giving generously, issuing the grand vow of compassion, still being drowned by one's own, Luhu Songbin's charity groups are scattered and divergent. If you want to restore their careers, you should have uniform steps, admire the spirit of unity, and then start to establish, only the south needle is regarded as the view, rely on the leadership of today, sigh the fire of heaven, alas, the full payment of sores and injuries, ten thousand rooms expand its wide mansion, hundreds of millions of surnames shelter its displacement, float in the South China Sea to assist in vibration, please issue Tang from the treasury, also avoid the land to show ambition, solid sound and name are transmitted, keep the purity and be pure, close to the bustle but not dyed, send the rest of the interest of the painting, combine the three excellences in the book poem, already silently repair the pure profession, climb the old age and why doubt, why is this disease suffered, just returned and reported sorrow, suddenly fierce asking, like the collapse of the five internal organs, the fathers and elders feel and fall in tears, the lanes hear and mourn, sad wind emblem its cloud passing, faint crane reins without return, look at the spike account in the famous garden, still the model is here, my party's old age is lost, Shenzhou has not washed away the fire, bestow a large recruitment on tonight, soul come and drink the fortress, alas, Shangxiang."</p>

<h3>Yong Wheel Restricts Passenger Ticket Water Foot Case Yu Qiaqing Telegraphically States Opinions Post-War Water Foot Increases All Wheels Obtain Surplus Facilitating Local Product Sales Should Sell at Forty Percent Discount</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai-Ningbo money transport, due to post-war passenger ticket water foot, continuously increasing, adding to the burden of the Zhejiang Eastern people, affecting local product sales, therefore the Ning County Party, Government, Military, Police, and Judicial Joint Meeting's 126th resolution decided to restrict it and instructed all transport companies to comply. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leading figure in the shipping industry of this city and the General Manager of the Chinese-Italian Company, yesterday telegraphed Ningbo, detailing his opinions. The original text states: "Chairman Chen of Ningbo County, Director Yu, and Chairman Zhou of the Chamber of Commerce, may your guidance be acknowledged. I have read Ningbo Shipping Association's Directive No. 278, issued by the Joint Meeting upon the request of the Chamber of Commerce to</p>
<p>Restrict Ship Ticket Water Foot</p>
<p>After the 126th resolution's deliberation, the recent water foot prices should be calculated at a 70% discount, with cabin ticket prices limited to one yuan and five jiao for the steerage, four yuan for the cabin, and six yuan for the first-class cabin. Tips for the tea attendant should be given at the passenger's discretion and not forced. We order all ships to comply, etc., demonstrating a sincere intention to be considerate and protective. Our company is pleased to hear this and will naturally comply. However, regarding the steerage ticket price and the freight discount, there are still points that require attention and explanation, which must be reiterated. The two yuan Shanghai-Ningbo steerage ticket price set by our company last year</p>
<p>Includes Tea Attendant's Wine Expenses</p>
<p>Previously, extortion was absolutely prohibited. Now, the small account is to be given at the passenger's discretion. At the beginning of this re-emphasized policy, it may be possible to comply for a while. However, the tea attendants' accumulated habits are ingrained, and with a slight slackening, they will easily seize the opportunity to use their old tricks. In the near future, I fear that the abuses of wine expenses equaling or exceeding the ticket price will occur. I urge you to pay special attention. As for the freight prices, they have been increased several times since August 13th. For example, in May of last year, Taikoo, Ning Shao, and our company, recognizing the soaring coal prices, jointly discussed and set new water foot prices to compensate for the losses. Our company and Taikoo have continued to comply until now.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Prohibits Direct Navigation</p>
<p>Various ships, under the pretext of detouring through Wenzhou and Taiwan, have doubled the previously set water foot prices, causing suffering to cargo and passengers. Witnessing this situation, our company has consistently maintained the original prices of the three companies, unwilling to increase them and avoid adding to the burden of passengers. Now that the Chamber of Commerce has approved the restriction of water foot prices, the authorities are being considerate of the merchants' difficulties, and the Chamber of Commerce is protecting its members. The intention is admirable. However, calculating freight at a 70% discount seems that cargo and passengers are still not receiving the actual benefit. Therefore, our company telegraphed Commander Guo a few days ago, advocating that, except for cotton, bulk goods such as silk, cocoons, tea leaves, paper, tin foil, etc.</p>
<p>Should Be Actually Charged at Forty Percent Discount</p>
<p>Because bulk goods are exclusively transported by the Fuhua Company, the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, and various cargo sales offices. The former two receive funding allocated by the government, and the latter receives subsidies from various industries to cover expenses. There is no need to collect commissions. If it is other goods, then generally charge a 50% discount, and give the customs broker an 8.5% commission to show preferential treatment. Once Shanghai-Ningbo direct navigation is restored, coal costs and sailing time can be saved relatively, and further reductions can be considered to facilitate the smooth transportation of local products. Moreover, what is currently exported from Ningbo is not entirely the local products of our Eastern Zhejiang. Anhui Southern Jiangxi and Hunan provinces</p>
<p>Transfer Through Oujiang and Ningbo for Export</p>
<p>The number is particularly considerable. Famous ships, during this peak season for local products, will definitely be able to thrive in business by reducing water foot prices. Observing the Kai Bo leased by Ning Shao and the Ende leased by Sanbei, even if calculated at half the water foot price, they can still have a surplus of tens of thousands of yuan each month, one can imagine the prosperity of the business and the need to reduce water foot prices. Hede has been engaged in the shipping industry for several decades, and has always held the dual goals of promoting the transportation of local products and alleviating rural poverty. This reduction in water foot prices is indeed the intention of our government to maintain the countryside. However, whether it is based on the prices set in May of last year and given a 70% discount, or based on the current water foot prices of detouring through Wenzhou and Taiwan and then discounted, is a matter of great importance, with huge differences. Because calculating at a 70% discount based on the prices in May of last year is not much different. If charging a 70% discount based on the water foot prices of detouring through Wenzhou and Taiwan, cargo and passengers will still not be able to benefit. I urge you to give detailed instructions and reply, I eagerly await. Yu Hede kowtows."</p>
<h3>Pudong False Alarm Electricity Interruption Entire Darkness Japanese Puppet Mourn Fear Disturbance All Night</h3>
<p>Since a large number of Chinese troops attacked the Japanese base in the Pudong Yanpu area on the morning of the 20th, the situation has been tense, and the residents are like frightened birds. Unexpectedly, a false alarm occurred again on the evening of the 21st. At 6:00 PM that evening, the electricity supplied by the Pudong Power Plant, which was occupied by the Japanese, was suddenly interrupted, and the streetlights in Dongchang Road and other places were completely extinguished, plunging into a world of darkness. The stores suspected that the guerrillas had attacked again and closed their doors one after another. The residents looked at each other in dismay. Japanese troops and puppet police were dispatched everywhere and the ferry crossings were closed early. For a time, the streets were deserted, like a dead land. Occasionally, the sound of galloping iron hooves could be heard, which was the Japanese army passing by. In addition, only the sound of dogs barking in the distance and sporadic gunshots could be heard, which were obviously Japanese troops making a show of force due to nervousness. However, the Japanese side had difficulty finding out where the wires were broken and why they were interrupted for a while, so the lights were not restored all night. The Japanese puppets were disturbed all night and could not find peace.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Rewards Overseas Chinese Investment Special Investment Guidance Office Established</h3>
<p>In view of the urgent need to develop the southwestern provinces, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has specially established an Overseas Chinese Investment Guidance Office to facilitate overseas Chinese investment. Branch offices have also been established in the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus of Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces. If overseas Chinese return to China to invest and are not very clear about the situation in the mainland, the commission will send personnel to provide guidance. It is reported that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have gathered 50 million yuan and are preparing to invest in the country to develop resources. Overseas Chinese leader Hu Wenhu has already arrived in Hong Kong from Singapore to discuss development matters with various provinces.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas on the Shanghai-Wuxi Road Fierce Battle with Japanese Troops Encirclement and Annihilation for Five Hours Two Hand-to-Hand Combats Two Company Commanders Heroically Martyred</h3>
<p>According to reliable Chinese sources arriving in Shanghai from Changshu, on the morning of the 19th of this month, the Japanese troops in Xintang Township between Taicang and Changshu along the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway were again surrounded and attacked by guerrillas. The guerrillas, led by Wang Koukou Regiment Commander of the 12th Brigade under the command of Commander Xiong of the Six County Guerrillas, engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops for five hours. The guerrillas engaged in hand-to-hand combat twice and broke into the Japanese defense zone, annihilating more than 50 Japanese troops. The guerrillas also suffered considerable losses. Company commanders Li Ligui and others heroically sacrificed themselves in this battle.</p>
<h3>All Patrol Ships of the Jianghai Customs Remain Only Two So Far The Rest Have Been Seized by the Japanese</h3>
<p>More than a dozen patrol ships of the Jianghai Customs, including Fuxing, Yunxing, Lianxing, Huguang, Jiaoji, and Fuwei, have not been returned since they were seized by the Japanese in the winter of the year before last. Although the General Taxation Department of the Customs has repeatedly negotiated, the Japanese have always delayed. It has been found that the above-mentioned patrol ships are no longer in the Huangpu River and have long been converted by the Japanese into military transport ships. It is also said that several of them have been severely damaged, and Fuxing is one example. During the Shanghai war, the ship's hull was pierced by artillery fire. Eight speedboats on the ship were also forcibly seized by the Japanese when the National Army had not yet withdrawn from Shanghai, because during the Shanghai war, the Japanese suspected that the Chinese troops who launched torpedoes at the Izumo warship were driving one of these speedboats. As of now, there are only two patrol ships under the jurisdiction of the Customs, Haiguang and Liuxing. Because these two ships are grain transport ships, specializing in supplying grain and fodder to the islands to guard the lighthouses, they were not seized. According to reports from Datong reporters, Luo Demian, Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, recently negotiated with the Japanese to release the seized patrol ships to facilitate customs work, but the Japanese still have no sincerity in returning them.</p>
<h3>Trademark Registration Must Be Certified by Association Tang Heqing's Suggestion</h3>
<p>Tang Heqing, manager of the Dahua Shunfeng Brand Thermos Factory in this city, is an executive member of the Thermos Industry Association. Recently, in view of the fact that the patterns and styles of trademarks are often similar among industry peers, and disputes often arise, which not only affects business but also causes disadvantages to both parties, and that this phenomenon is not unique to one industry, but occurs in various industries in Shanghai. In order to protect legitimate commerce and completely eliminate disputes, he wrote to the association to forward a letter to the Industry and Commerce Association to be presented to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that henceforth, trademark registrations must be certified in writing by the industry association before they can be examined and approved, because the industry association is a group of the industry and is familiar with the local industry situation, which can avoid imitation and deception. This suggestion is quite insightful, and it is expected that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will definitely adopt it.</p>
<h3>War Zone Chinese Paper Mills Japanese Implementation of Seizure Zeng Tempted Various Factories to Cooperate, Firmly Refused Now Dispatching Workers to Repair Machinery Preparing to Start Work</h3>
<p>The paper mills founded by Chinese merchants, opened in Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, and other places, total more than ten. Among them, the larger ones include the Dachina Paper Mill in Zhabei Yunzaobang, which occupies more than 30 mu of land, and all the factory buildings and machinery are worth more than one million yuan. The Tianzhang Paper Mill (located in Lujiazui, Pudong) and the Senji Paper Mill (located in Jinji Bridge, Xujiahui) founded by Liu Bosen are worth more than three million yuan. The Jiangnan Paper Mill (located at No. 10 Guangfu Road North, Caojiadu) founded by Wu Yaoting has a total property of more than two million yuan. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war and the westward movement of the National Army, the factories have been suspended one after another because they were in the war zone, and the factories' property has been seized by the Japanese, who tempted the factory owners to cooperate and start work, but the authorities of each factory deeply understood the great righteousness and would rather endure painful sacrifices and firmly refused to cooperate. It is now learned that the Japanese, in order to seize property rights, have come forward to take over through the "Paper Industry Co., Ltd." and have been employing Japanese, Korean, and general ignorant Chinese workers for days to carry out the repair of the machinery of each factory, preparing to start work. The Japanese's illegal acts of encroachment are deeply hated by the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Organizes Committee Considers Staff Treatment Committee Selection Already Announced</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Personnel Committee, on December 23rd of last year (Friday), passed the methods for granting the bureau's staff remittance allowances and living expenses allowances. The public has been quite critical of these methods. In view of this, the bureau has decided to invite representatives from the business community to form a committee. The task of the committee is to review the above-mentioned allowance methods and report to the Public Works Bureau. According to the opinion of the committee, whether the established methods are appropriate. If deemed inappropriate, how should they be revised? The elected members are as follows: Mr. R. E. Gilleland of Sheen Chang &amp; Co., Mr. Y. Hanawa of Mitsui &amp; Co., Mr. W. J. Hawkings of Moutai &amp; Co., Mr. H. S. Pouesen of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, Mr. W. H. Stewatt of HSBC, and Mr. Wu Yunqi of Jincheng Bank. The chairman of the Public Works Bureau Personnel Committee will attend the meeting to explain the reasons for passing the above-mentioned methods, but will not have the right to vote and will not sign the report.</p>

<h3>Jewish Refugees Residence Problem Resolved</h3>
<p>The Jewish refugees who have successively arrived in Shanghai from Europe total 1,740. The problem of their residence has not been resolved so far. The latest batch arriving in Shanghai, totaling 240, are currently residing in the Riverside Apartments. It is now learned that regarding the residence problem of the Jewish refugees, through the efforts of the European Relief Association, the Shanghai Municipal Council Huade Road Primary School has been temporarily used as a shelter for the Jewish refugees. It is currently being renovated, with regulations stating that 25 people can live in each room and using double-layered beds. The kitchen floor has also been renovated, paying attention to their sanitation facilities. It is reported that the primary school can accommodate up to 1,200 people.</p>

<h3>Physiological Changes of Newlyweds and Causes of Energy Decline</h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, graduate of the Medical Department of Russian Labor University</p>
<p>How beautiful and joyful it is for young men and women to love each other, with the charming image of their beloved engraved in their hearts and embracing sweet ideals?! If heaven grants their wish and they become a formal couple; the lover in their heart becomes a companion for a lifetime, isn't this new married bliss even more intoxicating?</p>
<p>However, during the period of marriage—becoming a new couple, all kinds of changes will occur both physically and mentally. This change is entirely a physiological phenomenon, a physiological phenomenon that has not been experienced in virginity or boyhood. Although it does not have a great impact on the physical and mental aspects of the new couple, it may sometimes be somewhat harmful.</p>
<p>Among the physical changes, the easiest to notice is the bride's weight gain. What is the reason for this? Originally, as a result of the couple living together, a kind of zymase is produced in the bride's body, which can naturally produce fat and increase the bride's weight. In medicine, this is called seminal cell hematopoiesis, which is the first change for a newlywed woman.</p>
<p>Therefore, newly married couples need to work hard and for a considerable period to enter the "Garden of Love." At the time of the wedding, women do not feel much interest in married life due to fear or overwork, so husbands should guide them in many ways to make them unconsciously accustomed to married life, and that will be good.</p>
<p>To consolidate the "foundation of love," the health of both husband and wife must be ensured. Although the soundness of the reproductive function between husband and wife cannot be regarded as the complete happiness of married life, it can at least be regarded as the key to harmony. If the reproductive function is not perfect, there will never be happiness in the family. Therefore, husbands and wives should strive to maintain the health of this function.</p>
<p>If we do not know hygiene before marriage, our health will obviously change. However, the change in physique after marriage can be said to be equal to that before marriage. There are many people who were energetic and rosy-faced youths before they got married, but unexpectedly became thin and pale after marriage. This is not uncommon. It is also common for those who were weak before marriage to become healthy and beautiful after marriage. However, these reasons are all related to poor health care, and those who lost their health before marriage are mostly due to excessive self-indulgence. Those who lose their health after marriage are caused by immoderate sexual activity. Premature ejaculation, kidney atrophy, and incomplete development are all caused by this. The best way to remedy this is to take "Buti Kang," a testicular seminal substance preparation for men, which is the most suitable for the symptoms. It is because the agent functions to increase sperm and replenish blood, and promote the development of reproductive organs. Countless experts in Europe and the United States all know that the agent's drug power is accurate, and it is an effective preparation for treating neurasthenia, premature aging, and the above-mentioned types of reproductive dysfunction. Anyone whose health declines after marriage will produce sperm and nourish the kidneys within 24 hours after taking this. The love between husband and wife is actually built on the foundation of health, and only "Buti Kang" can consolidate this foundation.</p>
<h3>Differentiation of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Internal Medicines for Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany</p>
<p>Nowadays, most young people are affected by bad environments, advocate freedom, are unrestrained, and indulge in extravagance and romance, so they suffer from seminal emission. This is due to excessive sexual desire. Other self-loving young people are diligent and hardworking, and in addition to the phenomenon of depression, which is everywhere, they feel the pressure of life and the fear of economy, so they have to work hard to solve their life problems. Due to mental fatigue, the nerves gradually turn weak. This creates seminal emission, which is also common.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this disease, first, we must avoid overwork and engage in increasing sperm and nourishing blood to promote the function of metabolism. Taking "Buti Kang" for men, a testicular seminal substance preparation, three times a day, three tablets each time, is very effective in treating neurasthenia, insomnia, waist pain, back pain, premature aging and other symptoms. No matter how serious the symptoms are, it is wonderful to start returning to spring. If you only feel frequent seminal emission, you should also take "Nais Seminal Emission Tablets" to guarantee a radical cure, because the medicinal properties of the two drugs are peaceful and have no side effects. It cannot be compared with other inferior drugs.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Virus Autumn</p>
<h3>Talking Again About the Problem of Short-Term Treatment of Gonorrhea — Ying Zhongchang, MD, USA</h3>
<p>…The life of gonorrhea in test tubes and the human body has different points…Judging the length of treatment with the life of gonorrhea in the test tube is a big mistake</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of whether gonorrhea can be cured radically in the short term, I have published an article in this publication. Now I still want to say more, so as to correct the Fang family.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the pathogenic bacteria of gonorrhea is diplococcus, but they do not know how diplococcus lives. The life of a bacterium in a test tube is very different from that in the body. Therefore, the life of gonorrhea in a test tube is very easy to annihilate, but if it is in our body, the drugs used for testing still cannot move its hair. The general short-sighted and inexperienced people believe that gonorrhea, which can be killed in a test tube in a few hours, can be cured in three to five days after being used on the human body. How do you know that it is not a big mistake. Our physiology has subtle and different functions and cannot be compared with other inorganic test tubes. Therefore, using the old-fashioned treatment of general osmotic sterilization to radically cure in the short term of three to five days is no different than climbing a tree to catch fish. Therefore, with this kind of hegemonic treatment method, it is of course impossible to complete the responsibility of curing gonorrhea in the short term!</p>
<p>To cure gonorrhea radically is not something that can be achieved by the over-the-counter drugs that are generally advertised on the market, claiming that it can be cured in three to five days. According to my own experience and the opinions of gonorrhea experts from various countries in the world, the "Kelinong" invented by the German gonorrhea expert Dr. Bi Sui has received unanimous praise. For initial leucorrhea, it can be cured radically in two or three weeks, and for those who have turned into chronic diseases, it will be rooted out in four or five weeks. This is not the statistical index I have obtained over the past ten years, but also the only reliable short-term treatment for gonorrhea by experts from all over the world. Because "Kelinong" has the effect of anti-inflammatory and bacteriophage, it can be step-by-step, short-term cure of gonorrhea that is difficult to cure radically. Because generally speaking, three to five weeks to cure leucorrhea radically is a necessary process.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Lecture</p>
<h3>Yao Juyan, Physician Clinic: Ningbo Road, Intersection of No. 9 Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>Deliberation on Leucorrhea Treatment</p>
<p>In Vain Suffering from Leucorrhea Patients</p>
<p>Of course, to cure a difficult disease radically, it is not enough to just shout out a new treatment, and the disease will be cured out of thin air. Recently, there has been a surge of gonorrhea treatments like bamboo shoots after a rain. What is even more strange is that general urban doctors today claim that the method they use to treat gonorrhea is the latest and most omnipotent, and by tomorrow, they will change to a new name and criticize their own treatment used yesterday as backward and outdated. I think that although medicine has made rapid progress today, it is probably not progressing so fast! What is suffering is that general gonorrhea patients are wandering on the fork in the road, at a loss, and delaying the condition, isn't this caused by those dazzling urban doctors who give to the poor gonorrhea patients?</p>
<p>The Radical Cure Method of Eliminating Poison</p>
<p>Our treatment of gonorrhea always relies on experimentation. Any treatment that has been radically cured by experimentation must have scientific preparation lines, and those that conform to scientific standards are not effective today and ineffective tomorrow. What is said is that the river will flow forever, and this is also the meaning. I have been in clinical practice for nearly 20 years. Every year, new treatments are used, and it cannot be said that they are not thorough, but most of them are famous but not practical. In my nearly 20 years of experience, in terms of electrotherapy, German static electrotherapy has the best sterilization power, and if X-rays are used to assist, the effect is even better. On the one hand, take the world's unanimously recognized gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" internally to promote the body's cells to produce anti-gonorrhea bacteriophage, so that the gonorrhea scattered everywhere can be eliminated in one fell swoop. Therefore, anyone who applies such scientific treatments will not relapse after healing. Because this is the meaning of eliminating poison thoroughly. Diagnosis time is from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. Starting today, 10 diagnosis numbers will be sent out every day, and each number will only cost 5 cents.</p>
<h3>Lung Disease Health Method</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Lung disease is the most chronic disease. It takes a long time to treat, and it also requires a lot of money. Therefore, some people say that tuberculosis is a rich disease, which means that only people with money are qualified to get this disease, and people without money only have a dead end. But that's not true. No matter what kind of lung disease, according to my experience over the years, "Bufei Naier" is indeed an effective preparation for governing the first two or three stages of lung disease, because the characteristics of this agent are to nourish the lungs and search for tuberculosis, and at the same time, it has the function of promoting appetite and relieving coughs and phlegm. Without the need for surgical operations, it can make up for lung depression and cavities. Major lung disease sanatoriums and experts in Europe and the United States all instruct patients to take this agent at home. As a result, many have achieved satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>Western Shanghai Border Area: Factory Construction Accelerates, Transforming into a Commercial Center; Building Permits Issued Exceed Last Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that shops, factories, and residences are being built in the western Shanghai area, with the northwest section of the Public Concession being the most active. The outer areas of Shanghai are rapidly transforming into a center for factories and commerce, with many being built on roads bordering the Concession. Although some citizens have protested against the disruption of residential areas, the construction of factories and the like is accelerating. Even a door-to-door survey cannot obtain reliable statistics, and there is apparently no official organization to compile such statistics. The Municipal Council naturally has no official information either, but it does keep count of buildings constructed within the Concession. An informal and simple survey of construction activities has been undertaken, which can also reveal the extent of construction outside the Concession. From December 1st of last year to the 17th of this month, no fewer than fifteen factory construction permits have been approved by the Municipal Council, all in western Shanghai. Eight of these permits were issued in December, and seven were issued in the first three weeks of this month. Furthermore, in the period from December 1st to January 17th, 129 shop construction permits were issued, of which 102 were in western Shanghai; 62 residential building permits were issued, all in western Shanghai; 35 permits for the construction of Chinese-style bungalows were issued, of which 32 were in western Shanghai; and 36 permits for the construction of Chinese businesses were also issued, all in western Shanghai. By the end of this month, a comparison will likely show that the number of permits issued this month will slightly exceed the number issued last month.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University on Haig Road: All Safe and Sound; Rumors Circulating Outside are Entirely False</h3>
<p>Late last night, rumors suddenly spread that the refugee camp inside Jiaotong University on Haig Road in Xujiahui, western Shanghai, had been stormed by more than ten people, and that gunshots had been heard. This newspaper's reporter immediately went to the Louza Police Station to inquire, and was told that there was absolutely no such incident. Subsequently, they went to Jiaotong University on Haig Road to investigate and saw three police officers guarding the gate: a foreign police officer, a Russian police officer, and a Chinese police officer, whose number was 742. According to the Chinese police officer, the area was very peaceful today, and the rumors circulating outside were entirely false.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Army Uses Search as Pretext to Kidnap and Extort</h3>
<p>According to someone from Gao Hang in Pudong, Xu Hongfa's troops, a pseudo-"army" in Chuansha, used the pretext of searching for guerrillas to enter the town and select wealthy households to kidnap people for ransom. The other day, in eastern Gao Hang, not far from Gaoqiao, twelve villagers were captured by Xu's troops. Before leaving, his henchmen told people to quickly prepare money for ransom, saying that they would send the money to the Japanese military, as a form of intimidation. The villagers are in a dire situation, with no means of survival.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Run Over by Car</h3>
<p>Wu Tugeng, a Changzhou native nearly forty years old and a rickshaw driver at the Chengji stables at the intersection of Columbia Road in western Shanghai, was suddenly knocked to the ground by a Westerner's car yesterday afternoon, suffering severe injuries to his head, arms, and other areas. A street police officer from the Jing'an Temple Police Station spotted the incident and quickly summoned an ambulance, which rushed him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Banking and Finance Industry Friendship Association Forms Welfare Mutual Aid Group</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking and Finance Industry Amateur Friendship Association, organized by people in the banking and finance industries in Shanghai, has been established for less than three years, but its affairs are thriving and are highly praised by financial circles. Recently, the association has been preparing a welfare mutual aid group, the purpose of which is to stabilize the lives of its members and ensure that those engaged in the banking and finance industry can live and work in peace. The welfare mutual aid group was proposed by the association's Welfare Committee and includes loan, health, economic assistance, and children's education groups. All members of the association can join as members, and once they join, they can enjoy the aforementioned benefits. Small matters such as haircuts, bathing, medical care, and hygiene can be resolved free of charge, while larger issues such as personal finances, life insurance, unemployment, accident protection, and children's education can also be easily addressed, benefiting society and the people. It is said that people in the finance industry have responded enthusiastically, and authorities of various banks and pawnshops are happy to help make it happen.</p>
<h3>Passengers Traveling South Must Be Vaccinated Against Smallpox</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily Mail reports that there was a slight error in yesterday's publication regarding the vaccination certificate requirements for those traveling to Hong Kong and Manila. The corrected information is as follows: For those traveling to Hong Kong, only vaccination certificates issued by the Municipal Council, with a photo of the vaccinated person attached and stamped with the Health Department's seal, are valid if traveling in third class or steerage. Passengers traveling in first and second class can use vaccination certificates signed and certified by a well-known doctor in Shanghai, which are also valid. As for Manila, vaccination certificates issued by the Municipal Council and by the Shanghai doctors listed by the shipping companies sailing to Manila are valid. As far as the personnel of the Municipal Council's Health Department know, the regulations in Manila do not require a photograph of the vaccinated person to be attached to the vaccination certificate.</p>
<h3>Call for Plain Clothing from All Walks of Life; Origin of the Plain Clothing Association</h3>
<p>Since various circles in this city launched a campaign to advocate wearing plain clothing and to organize a Plain Clothing Association, the news has been publicized and has been met with enthusiastic responses from all sides, eagerly hoping that the association will be established as soon as possible. This is because such an organization not only conforms to the principle of frugality but also benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood. The origin of the association is recorded below: "It is said that if the country is extravagant, show it frugality; if the country is frugal, show it etiquette. How true this is! Indeed, it is timeless. The reasons for our country's weakness are certainly not limited to one aspect, but insightful people say that our country relies on agricultural production for industrial consumption, and those who lead society are accustomed to luxurious enjoyment, the people's livelihood is difficult, and all matters are gradually abandoned. Is this not one of the reasons? Improving life is an essential element of social progress, but a truly progressive society must seek the proximity of the lives of the majority of the people in order to last forever. If we have fat meat in the kitchen and starving people in the fields, then those who enjoy it must feel like they are sitting on a stove and cannot be at ease for a day. Moreover, our country is in such difficult times, broken and displaced, if we do not work diligently and thriftily, with one heart and one mind, how can we save the country from danger and achieve the success of revival? Looking back at ancient history, when Wei suffered enemy invasion and the country was broken and the people were exhausted, when Duke Wen came to the throne, he wore clothes of coarse cloth and a hat of coarse silk, and worked hard to govern. In the first year, he reduced thirty chariots, and in the following year, he reduced three hundred chariots. The people gathered and the government rose, and Wei was restored. Yu governed the floods, with meager diet, disliked fine clothes, and lived in humble palaces. Therefore, Confucius praised him as 'I have no fault to find.' Now that sovereignty is in the hands of the people, and the fate of the country is turning around, it also depends on the collective efforts. We all believe that clothing is a matter of shaping the body, and enjoyment and boasting all start with clothing. Those who wear beautiful clothes and gorgeous decorations are often accustomed to laziness. Therefore, we have specifically launched the Plain Clothing Association to encourage each other to be frugal and diligent, hoping that a journey of a thousand miles will start with a single step, and a mountain of nine inches will start with a basket of soil. The success of construction depends on the collective efforts to see its completion. Fellow countrymen and gentlemen, why not come here?"</p>
<h3>Moore Memorial Church Social Service Group Distributes Clothing and Rice to Refugees; Continues to Promote and Expand Relief Efforts; Plans to Add Medical Relief Organization</h3>
<p>The Social Service Group of the Youth Department of Moore Memorial Church in this city, in view of the refugees gathered on the streets and in the alleys, which is heartbreaking to see, the group members have been collecting cotton quilts and clothes, etc., and held the first distribution yesterday at Moore Memorial Church on Yu Qiaqing Road. The details are recorded below: (1) The group members went to various places in the evening to investigate the situation of the refugees, made reports, and registered the names of the refugees for reference. (2) Relief standards: A. Young children who are more susceptible to disease; B. Elderly and weak people who are susceptible to disease; C. Teenagers under sixteen years old, without work, lonely and helpless; D. Hard laborers who cannot support their family; E. Middle-aged singles who cannot work due to illness. (3) After the group members inquired about their suffering in detail, they registered their names and gave them certificates, instructing them to gather in front of the church on time to wait for the distribution of relief clothing. (4) The group set up a review committee to determine the amount of items to be distributed based on the reports of the investigators, numbered and distributed them. (5) The group collected various needed items from Western missionaries who are enthusiastic about public welfare, the Children's Welfare Association, the People's Livelihood Canteen, and a portion of the donations for the Christmas festival, for distribution. (6) At 3 o'clock that day, they sat in order in the auditorium of Moore Memorial Church, and the host of the group gave a speech and administered smallpox vaccinations according to the numbers (Municipal Council Health Department), followed by the distribution of relief items. (7) The number of people receiving relief items was more than 600, including more than 400 cotton jackets, 53 cotton quilts, more than 100 children's clothes, and 1,000 rice coupons (one catty each). It is learned that Mr. Cai Huangsheng, the secretary of the group, said that they plan to continue to promote and expand relief efforts, and in view of the fact that many refugees are sick and unable to receive treatment, which is tantamount to sitting and waiting for death, they plan to add a medical relief organization, and hope that people from all walks of life will provide assistance.</p>

<h3>Dispute over Eviction: Tenant Refuses to Move and Prepares to Appeal</h3>
<p>Wu Hongda, a local resident of No. 314 Maiqi Road, French Concession, is 37 years old and owns a three-story, three-room and two-wing residential building at No. 18, Lane 79, Zhao Bishop Road. He rents it to seven tenants: Ding Mingshi, Tao Peiyuan, Gu Jingliang, Gu Dianshao, Mrs. Lin, Shen Weisun, Xu Bingsheng, etc., with a total monthly rent of 180 yuan. The monthly rent for each tenant ranges from 33 yuan to 15 yuan. The landlord, Wu Hongda, mortgaged the land of the house to Feng Shouzheng. Due to the overdue debt, the creditor pressed the Special Second Court's Civil Division to rule for execution of the auction. Subsequently, Wu sold the house to Lu Donghou on June 18 of last year for 50,000 yuan. Later, in October of last year, Wu Hongda and the new owner, Lu Donghou, hired lawyers Zhou Rong and Qian Jianqiu to file a lawsuit with the Special Second Court's Civil Division against the seven tenants, including Ding Mingshi, demanding eviction. The defendant tenants, Ding Mingshi and the other six, hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to defend them, arguing based on the circumstances and the law, and objecting to the eviction on the grounds that they did not owe rent. The case was opened and investigated repeatedly, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. The case has been declared closed for debate, and the court ruled the other day to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit, with the litigation costs to be borne by the plaintiffs. It is reported that the plaintiffs are very dissatisfied with the first-instance judgment and are preparing to appeal to the High Branch Court to achieve the purpose of eviction. However, in this isolated island where there are many people and few houses, disputes over housing eviction are endless, which is truly a great difficulty for the courts. It is unknown how this case will end in the future.</p>
<h3>Notes on Huang Xiaoting's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Huang Xiaoting, a painter from Jiangxi, has a noble character. His works combine the achievements of various masters of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and are applied to the tip of his brush, making him a giant in the art world. Recently, in response to the encouragement of friends, he displayed more than a hundred of his accumulated masterpieces at the Central Grand Hotel on Wuma Road. I went to visit the exhibition and found that the works were truly exquisite. For example, his imitation of Da Chi's "Group Peaks Accumulating Snow" is refined in brushwork and simple in ink, rich and calm. His imitation of Xinluo's landscape handbook has lively lines and stable colors, without being greasy or flamboyant. His imitation of Gou Daoren's landscape has a secluded and elegant charm that can be read endlessly. Other imitations of Xiangguang's ink rhyme are mellow, pure, and simple, yet achieve a wonderful effect. The majesty of Shanchiao, the splash ink of Fangshan, the strength of Shitian, and the breadth of Fanghu are as if he is holding the souls of the ancients and capturing them all under his brush. The grandeur of his artistic conception cannot be described in words. There is also a painting of "Ziling Fishing Platform," with a spirit that is ancient, lush, clear, strong, and elegant, all of which are scenes of Fuchun. It is said that Mr. Huang has lived in Fuchun for more than ten years, so he has a unique perspective on the scenery of the Fuchun River. Overall, the strength of the gentleman lies in immersing himself in the methods of the ancients, but also being able to create his own new ideas, and not being confined by the ancients. As for flowers, figures, birds, and animals, all are exquisite, unrestrained, and make people yearn for them.</p>
<h3>Cuckoo Occupying the Magpie's Nest: Robbed Clean</h3>
<p>The address of No. 317 Santai Wharf Lane in Nanshi was formerly the Yuanxing medicinal materials warehouse. Before the National Army withdrew in the winter of the year before last, the warehouse owner moved the valuable medicinal materials to the Concession, but a large number of medicinal materials were left behind, all piled up in the house (which was three stories high with three rooms and two wings). Three warehouse workers were assigned to guard the house. From the spring to the summer of last year, the house was searched and robbed by local bandits five or six times. All the medicinal materials were stolen by the bandits with flatbed carts. Even the three guards were beaten and injured by the bandits. The warehouse workers then locked the empty house and left. In July of last year, a Ningbo native named Zhao Lianfa, who was a machine coppersmith and formerly worked in a shipyard, and now works as a foreman in a shipyard set up by the Japanese at the South Wharf in Pudong, moved into the empty house because he had no place to live. He has lived there for more than five months. Because his daily wages were good, he had some money left over, so he brought his family from Ningbo to live with him in the house, which attracted the covetousness of the bandits. The night before last (21st), at more than half past midnight, seven bandits suddenly came, broke into the house, and held torches and weapons, each holding knives and clubs. They first grabbed Zhao and forced him to hand over money, but failed, so they beat him and searched the house. It is estimated that they robbed more than 70 yuan in cash and more than 100 yuan worth of cotton clothes, pants, overcoats, and quilts before escaping.</p>
<h3>Girl Falls from Building</h3>
<p>Lu Xiaomei, a girl from Shaoxing, who is only four years old, accidentally fell from the building at around twelve o'clock yesterday noon, causing a severe head injury. Her family members summoned an ambulance. It is said that her injury is serious and her life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special: Shanghai School Education During the War of Resistance (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chonggan</p>
<p>From the table above, it can be seen that there are as many as 350 schools in the war-torn occupied areas. Private unregistered schools and special areas on the original site that have been forced to close due to environmental constraints are not included. Moreover, elementary schools have far less economic power than universities and middle schools, so very few can move to the safe areas of the Concession to resume classes. However, the establishment of elementary schools is like bamboo shoots after a rain, even more numerous than universities and middle schools. According to recent surveys and statistics, there are currently 403 elementary schools in the city, with 113,365 students, a decrease of about 170 schools compared to before the war. If we compare the current situation with the past geographical area, it cannot be said to be small in quantity. However, in terms of quality, some schools urgently need to be improved.</p>
<p>4. Compulsory Education</p>
<p>Compulsory education in Shanghai was implemented in accordance with central government regulations, starting in the 24th year of the Republic [1935]. Although it only had two years of history by the time the War of Resistance began, the undertaking had already taken shape. The various facilities in the 25th year of the Republic [1936] are listed separately below to show a glimpse of them.</p>
<p>1. Short-term Elementary Schools: 24 schools were set up in the first semester, including 17 schools with three classes and 7 schools with two classes. 26 schools were set up in the second semester, including 19 schools with three classes and 7 schools with two classes.</p>
<p>2. Short-term Elementary School Classes: 100 classes were set up in the first semester and 110 classes in the second semester.</p>
<p>3. Additional Junior Elementary Schools: In the first semester, 4 more schools were added than in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], including 2 schools with two grades and 2 schools with a single grade. In the second semester, 3 more schools were added than in the first semester, including 2 schools with two grades and 1 school with a single grade.</p>
<p>4. Expansion of Existing School Grades: 28 grades were added in the first semester compared to the 24th year of the Republic [1935], and 18 grades were added in the second semester compared to the first semester.</p>
<p>5. Promotion of Two-Part System Schools: 4 grades were added in the first semester compared to the 24th year of the Republic [1935], and 4 grades were added in the second semester compared to the first semester.</p>
<p>6. Implementation of Mobile Education: A special Zhenpu Mobile Education Experimental Zone was set up to recruit students equivalent to three classes of short-term elementary schools.</p>
<p>The above are all the compulsory education facilities at the end of the 25th year of the Republic [1936] before the start of the War of Resistance in Shanghai. Because this undertaking was entirely run by the government, with no private funding, it was difficult to maintain after the end of the educational administrative organs and the cut off of funding. Moreover, the original undertakings were scattered in the suburbs, making it even more difficult to restore them. Therefore, except for a small number of short-term elementary school teachers on the original sites who painstakingly managed to set up schools in safe areas, with about 40 grades, the rest of the undertakings were all suspended. Moreover, due to economic difficulties and the lack of self-provided school buildings, they had to borrow from ordinary schools, and the recurring expenses could not but be subsidized by charging students fees. This is different from before the war, when no fees were charged and school supplies were provided. Fortunately, all educational facilities comply with central government regulations, which is comforting.</p>
<p>5. Conclusion</p>
<p>Overall, in terms of school education during the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the number of higher education, secondary education, and primary education has increased or remained the same, but compulsory education has not been able to quickly restore its former state. However, in terms of quality, there is still much that needs to be done by educational personnel. I would like to briefly describe my limited views below.</p>
<p>1. In the future, the establishment of schools at all levels should focus on practical education and adapt to the actual needs of the city's environment, with national defense construction as the highest principle.</p>
<p>2. School buildings and grounds must be expanded to the extent possible, so as not to hinder the normal and healthy development of students' physical and mental well-being.</p>
<p>3. The faculty must be improved and enriched to ensure that every teacher can be a role model for students in terms of knowledge, experience, and morality. Equipment must be purchased in consideration of economic conditions, and schools can cooperate to do so if necessary.</p>
<p>4. The amount of fees paid by students should not be raised excessively. In the aftermath of the war, people's livelihoods are deteriorating, and increasing the burden on students will lead to the worry of being unable to afford school. Education should be for education's sake, and the accumulated ills of commercialization should be reversed.</p>
<p>5. Youth training should be strict, reversing the past trend of laxity, so that every student is aware of the importance of the mission they bear during the War of Resistance and knows what to strive for.</p>
<p>6. Unregistered schools should complete the registration procedures as soon as possible within the possible scope to avoid misleading students and hindering their development prospects. (End)</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Warfare Active Everywhere, Japanese Troops in Dire Straits; Japanese Prostitutes and Vagrants Accompany Japanese Troops, Committing Fraud and Deception Everywhere, Causing Annoyance and Resentment</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that, according to a Chinese merchant returning from the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway area yesterday (the 31st), prostitutes, vagrants, and swindlers are entering the Chinese interior along with the Japanese troops. Whenever they arrive at a place, they become objects of insult and extortion by Japanese soldiers and vagrants. However, Chinese guerrilla forces often launch attacks. Wherever there are Japanese soldiers, there are wine shops, dance halls, and brothels, because</p>
<p>Prostitutes and Vagrants</p>
<p>travel with the Japanese troops everywhere. For example, there are many brothels and dance halls in Suzhou. In reality, there is not much difference between the two. Japanese troops still massacre or mistreat Chinese civilians, and Japanese planes still bomb villages in their rear. Whenever the Japanese troops hear of active guerrilla activity somewhere, they immediately dispatch planes to bomb the area without further investigation, regardless of whether there are guerrillas there or not.</p>
<p>Many Villages are Bombed.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, a wounded farmer who had been bombed walked from Xinzhuang, twenty miles away, to Jiaxing for medical treatment. The guerrillas near Xinzhuang have been causing the Japanese troops anxiety for several weeks. The Japanese troops angrily dispatched 500 men to try to disperse the guerrillas. At that time, the guerrillas were stationed in Wuzhen. The guerrilla spies in Jiaxing had already reported the information of the Japanese troops' impending invasion to the</p>
<p>Guerrilla Force,</p>
<p>who made preparations in advance. They left some soldiers to lure the Japanese troops traveling on sampans to sail up the river beside Wuzhen. The narrower the river became, the closer they got to the ambush. They lured the Japanese troops to land and attacked them from behind. The Japanese troops were unprepared and panicked, scrambling back into the sampans to escape. However, due to the extreme chaos, many were killed or wounded on the spot. Only 300 men escaped back to Jiaxing. The next day, the Japanese dispatched three planes to bomb the guerrillas.</p>
<p>But What They Bombed</p>
<p>was not Wuzhen, where the guerrillas were stationed, but Xinzhuang, which was ten miles away from the town. A week later, the Jiaxing puppet newspaper reported that the Japanese troops had gone to Xinzhuang to fight the guerrillas, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and dispersing the guerrillas. The Japanese troops only suffered a few casualties, etc. The Chinese merchant further said that he had heard from travelers on the Nanjing-Shanghai line that the guerrillas</p>
<p>Often Haunt the Railway</p>
<p>area, destroying railway tracks and bridges. The Japanese troops were at a loss and suspected that the guerrillas disguised themselves as passengers and got off at various stations to carry out sabotage. Therefore, there were notices posted at every station with drawings of merchants carrying packages at the station and the words "Passengers on the train must protect the railway," etc. The Japanese troops also had no safety when transporting or mobilizing troops on the highway. Along the larger roads, the Japanese troops built countless fortresses and machine-gun nests, and</p>
<p>In Important Areas</p>
<p>they erected barbed wire fences all around. Some guerrillas attacked from the river, so the Japanese troops erected double barbed wire fences on the riverbanks. Recently, a large number of Japanese merchants have been going to Suzhou and Jiaxing, carrying silk fabrics, medicines, and other goods. However, most Chinese people do not use Japanese medicines and cosmetics. Japanese women are the only customers for cosmetics.</p>
<p>However, Japanese Cloth</p>
<p>sells quite widely. Japanese vagrants in the Hongkou and Yangpu districts also travel with the Japanese troops in large numbers, causing trouble and doing all kinds of evil. This is because they know that no one dares to complain to the Japanese military police. In the occupied towns and villages between Nanjing and Shanghai, the Japanese do not have sufficient troops stationed. Therefore, they are often the target of guerrilla attacks. For example, Wujiang, which is fifteen miles away from Suzhou,</p>
<p>a Large Detachment of Japanese Troops</p>
<p>returned to Wujiang, but the guerrillas had already left. Therefore, the guerrillas constantly attacked and harassed the Japanese troops, while the Japanese troops engaged in direct combat with the guerrillas. Both sides suffered losses, but the Japanese troops' casualties, military supplies, and financial losses were far greater than those of the guerrillas.</p>

<h3>Zhong Xinpu Denies His Nephew; Court Sternly Rejects It; Initial Trial Verdict Appealed and Again Rejected; Regardless of Whether Married into Another Family, Bloodline Cannot be Severed</h3>
<p>Zhong Pinfang, a local resident, currently living at 260 Hartung Road, lost his mother at a young age and lived with his maternal grandparents. The Zhong family originally lived in an old house in the city and had some assets. Pinfang's grandmother, Mrs. Yang, and Pinfang's uncle, Xinpu (formerly a senior official at the post office), lived together. When the war broke out, they moved to the Helanfang neighborhood on Fulu Road, but</p>
<p>Pinfang and his mother, because the house there was small, still lived separately. After his grandmother, Mrs. Zhong Yang, died in the summer of last year, Zhong Xinpu suddenly claimed that Pinfang's father (i.e., his younger brother) had married into the Shen family ten years ago. Therefore, he denied that Zhong Pinfang was Mrs. Zhong Yang's grandson. Pinfang was not listed in the printed obituary. Pinfang then</p>
<p>Protested to His Uncle Xinpu. After mediation by relatives and friends failed, he filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against Zhong Xinpu to confirm his identity. He hired lawyers Zhang Hongwei and Wu Chuliang to represent him, citing Article 967 of the Civil Code and the Supreme Court's case No. 2143 of the Republic of China year 22, "Blood relations cannot be extinguished by the consent of the parties."</p>
<p>They attacked, and clarified that regardless of whether there was marriage into another family, even if there was such an event, blood relations could not be severed, etc. The initial trial verdict confirmed that Zhong Pinfang was the grandson of Mrs. Zhong Yang. The defendant, Zhong Xinpu, refused to accept this and filed an appeal with the High Second Branch Court, stating reasons. After repeated summonses and deliberations by the collegiate panel,</p>
<p>Research and Trial, the court declared that the defendant had no sufficient reasons, and that the original judgment was without error. The court opened on the previous day, ruling that the appeal was rejected, and that the appellant was to bear the costs of litigation for the first and second trials.</p>
<h3>Fierce Bandit in the Fahua Area; Resists Arrest and Escapes; Flees into the Concession for Treatment and is Eventually Captured; Yesterday Sent to Court for Sentencing and Temporarily Detained in the Western Jail</h3>
<p>Personnel from the Public Concession Police Department had captured ten male and female bandits in the Fahua area of Shanghai. At that time, they were taken away by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on Jessfield Road, who considered that they had to review their activities, whether they had joined the guerrilla work. After extracting them on January 12, up to the present, it is heard that they have not been returned to the Police Department. Thus, the police cannot be brought to the Special First Court for prosecution. Only at the time the personnel of the Police Department were searching and arresting in Fahua, there was a local fierce bandit, named Fu Bao Lin (transliteration) who opened fire, resisted arrest and escaped. The Police Department immediately ordered its subordinates to step up the arrest. Unexpectedly, the bandit was injured when he resisted arrest and fled to the Concession for medical treatment. He was captured by detectives and sent to the Public Works Department Hospital. Yesterday, the police brought him to the court for interrogation and he was sentenced to three and a half years of hard labor and sent to Ward Road Prison for temporary detention, waiting for other bandits to be returned by the Japanese side, and the case will be handled together.</p>
<h3>Enticing a Girl; Sentenced to Eight Months</h3>
<p>Huatanmupai Shaochang of Gordon Road Police Station, previously in a house at 918 Pinang Road, arrested a Anhui woman Zhang Wu, who enticed children, recovered two 11-year-old Jiangbei girl Luo Xiaozier and 8-year-old girl Zhang Gendi, and brought them to the police station and sent them to the First Special District Court. Both girls were taken back by their families, and Zhang Wu was returned to custody. Former Magistrate Huang Risheng of the Agriculture Court came to court for continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer for the Police Station, stated that the chief offender, the woman Zhan Yang, could not be arrested. It was found that the two girls were enticed by Zhan Yang, who paid 30 yuan and asked the defendant to keep them in her house, intending to take them to Tianjin to sell and profit from them. Inquired about the actual operation, her confession was ambiguous. Then, the two girls proved that they were not allowed to speak loudly upstairs in her house, called her "mother", and were not allowed to go downstairs, etc. Magistrate Huang sentenced Zhang Wu to eight months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Young Girl Learning to Drive; Hits a Pedestrian</h3>
<p>A Chinese girl, about ten years old, was learning to drive a private car on Great Western Road near Dunxin Road at 11:15 yesterday afternoon. However, her skills were poor, and she crashed recklessly, knocking pedestrian Zhang Zhikang (age 17, residing at 35, Lane 612, Hart Road) to the ground, causing serious injuries. At the same time, a Mobil gasoline pump column erected there was also knocked down. Afterwards, the nearby police station at No. 2788 heard the alarm and immediately called an ambulance to rush to the scene, sending the injured to the hospital for treatment. The girl who caused the accident was taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Gordon Road Police Station; Captures Gambling Boats; Detains Two Key Criminals, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Mao Axiang, a flower club leader who has been wanted by the authorities for many times, relying on the protection of certain western special forces, set up a large flower club factory in the tobacco and gambling area, opening three rounds a day. In recent months, the money cheated has been no less than ten thousand. During the week, the Concession Police Authorities, in addition to blocking the main traffic routes connecting the tobacco and gambling dens, also sent detectives to conduct strict inspections at the intersection. The gamblers were deeply afraid that when the induced gambling boats passed by, they would be arrested and investigated. Then, the gambling money hidden on their bodies would be confiscated. Therefore, they specifically notified all boats that anyone carrying flower club notes should hand over all gambling money to other boats. The idea was very thoughtful, and the flower club factory was moved to Gongyi Lane on Rue Robert, which is close to the Concession. It is said that this is still a branch factory, while the main factory is still located in Caojiadu. Cao Amao, a famous rogue in the Putuo Road area, is now willing to act as a lackey, hired as a boatman. He hires Liu Ahai, who spends all day collecting gambling money from those who gamble on the flower club. The other day, detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station first intercepted Liu on the way, and then arrested Cao Amao at 80 Penang Road. They immediately searched his house and found a register recording the names of the flower club. The other day, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Dai interrogated them. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer for the Police Station, charged them with the crime of gathering to gamble and presented the seized material evidence, requesting punishment. Liu confessed without denial, while Cao was cunning, saying that he worked at the Xielong Glass Factory, and that the records were all goods accounts, and that he was falsely accused by Liu. He also hired two lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, to defend him, requesting bail. The court ordered Cao to pay 400 yuan as bail, and Liu was returned to custody, awaiting sentencing.</p>
<h3>Kenne Road; Squatter Huts Difficult to Relocate</h3>
<p>There are more than 200 squatter huts in the Kenne Road area of the Northern District. Because the landlord of the address intends to build houses, he intended to give each household 10 yuan as relocation funds, ordering all squatter huts to relocate. However, the squatters believe that once they relocate, there will be no place to live, so the deadline has been extended to this day, which has been two months. Each squatter hut is still unwilling to relocate.</p>
<h3>Kan Ze's Sword; Brought to Shanghai to Wait for Sale; Excavated from the Former Residence of the Wu Prime Minister of the Three Kingdoms</h3>
<p>The Cihu Lake near the suburbs of Ningbo Cixi County has beautiful scenery with rippling waves and reflections. Its location is the former residence of Kan Ze, the Prime Minister of the Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. Recently, a resident with the surname Wang was digging the ground near the lake when he discovered an ancient sword. It was covered in rust and had an ancient feel. According to the appraisal of archaeologists, it is an ancient artifact from thousands of years ago. Since the place used to be the former residence of the Wu Prime Minister, Mr. Li, who works in Shanghai, took the item to Shanghai, seeking a good price for it.</p>
<h3>Theft Case on Tiantong Road</h3>
<p>A residence with the surname Mou at No. 7, Lane 615, Tiantong Road, was suddenly broken into by three bandits at around 8:15 yesterday evening. Two of the bandits were carrying firearms, threatening the men and women in the house and prohibiting them from making a sound. They drove them to a corner of the house and guarded them, while the unarmed bandits rushed into the inner rooms. As a result of the search, the bandits snatched clothes and money totaling more than 230 yuan and fled. Afterwards, the owner went to the police station in charge to report and request a pursuit.</p>
<h3>Foreigner Injured and Unconscious; Severe Head Injury; Remains Unconscious After Treatment</h3>
<p>The Chinese-language newspaper *Zi Lin Bao* reports that, yesterday (the 21st), shortly after noon, a police officer was passing through a lane near the east side of East Seward Road when he found a foreigner who had lost consciousness. By the early morning of today, he was still unconscious, so it was impossible to determine who he was. It is believed that he is a Russian. He had a severe head injury and blood was flowing from his ears and nose. He was immediately taken to the Hongkew Police Station, where first aid was administered, but it was impossible to revive him. An ambulance was called and the person was taken to the Country Hospital for treatment of his injuries. As of this morning, it was learned that the person was still unconscious and unable to be revived. The cause of the injury is still unknown.

<h3>Falsely Established Silk Shop; Issuing Checks Indiscriminately; Swindling Fellow Silk Merchants; Check Deadline Approaching; Owners and Partners Flee Together; Yunlin and Dahua Shops Sued for Being Swindled</h3>
<p>Ding Shanhao from Ningbo established a Ruikang Silk Shop on South Wuxi Road, hiring Li Zhensheng from Jiaxing as a runner, using bad checks to swindle silk from fellow merchants. On the 27th of last month, with the swindled amount of goods being large, and the issued checks all about to expire, he abandoned the shop and fled. Yunlin and Dahua Silk Shops, which were swindled, separately filed criminal self-suits for fraud with the First Special District Local Court. After the court opened and learned that both defendants had fled without a trace, it ruled to issue arrest warrants. However, Hu Huanwen, the owner of Dahua Shop, after filing the self-suit, also hired a lawyer to report to the Laozha Police Station that Ding and Li had issued 500 yuan in bad checks from the Donglai Bank, swindling goods. The police station initially did not know that a self-suit had already been filed, and thus investigated and confirmed the facts. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed against Ding and Li. It was not until the trial the other day that the previous situation was learned, and the court immediately applied to withdraw the public prosecution case.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Factory Manager Assassinated; Bullet Through Abdomen and Back, Killed; Conflicting Rumors Regarding the Reason for the Murder; Police Authorities Investigating Closely</h3>
<p>Chen Ningchao from Ningbo, age 50, residing at No. 20, Zhichengfang, Lane 300, Rue Galle, French Concession, has been the manager of Yingfeng Dyeing Factory for many years. The factory's business department is located at No. 20, Yingchunfang, Daxin Street, Hubei Road, Public Concession. Recently, Chen was auditing the accounts at the Yingfeng Factory's business department and had not returned home for two days and nights. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 21st, Chen returned to his residence at Zhichengfang, Rue Galle.</p>
<p>He was sitting in the living room, chatting, drinking tea, and smoking cigarettes with his family when, about half an hour later, a person wearing a long robe suddenly called Chen out to talk in the alley. Chen followed him out of the door. When they walked to the trash can in the cross alley of Zhichengfang, three or four people in short clothes emerged and fired a handgun at Chen. The people then scattered and fled out of the alley. Chen was hit by a bullet in the upper right of his abdomen,</p>
<p>penetrating his back and waist, and he fell to the ground, screaming for help. When his family and neighbors heard the sound and appeared, the murderer had already fled without a trace. The family immediately reported to the French Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. An ambulance was immediately summoned to rush Chen to Guangci Hospital. After the doctor performed surgery, because the injury was in a vital spot and the blood loss was excessive, he died at 10 p.m. that night. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the autopsy center attached to the Public Works Department Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour, to be inspected by the Second Special District Court today. The French Police Department has issued a notice to all its detectives to investigate the murderer and bring him to justice. As for the reason for Chen's murder, it is rumored to be due to some kind of relationship, but the rumors are mixed and conflicting. The police station is now conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Tailor Shop and Noodle Shop; Two Gangs Clashed in a Crowd Fight; The Whole Family of the Tailor Shop was Beaten and Injured; Ordered to Submit to a Forensic Examination and then Re-Interrogated</h3>
<p>Qin Anquan from Ningbo, 31 years old, is a Hongbang tailor, living at No. 150 Rue Massenet, French Concession. As a second landlord, he rented the downstairs shop to Tang Faren from Danyang to open a noodle shop. The other day, Tang's partner urinated in the doorway, causing a conflict with Qin Ruiliang, the young owner of the tailor shop at No. 461 Rue Paul Beau (the tailor shop was established by Qin Anquan's elder brother Qin Anshou). The two sides invited about 20 partners and</p>
<p>they fought with each other, the situation was tense, as if facing a great enemy. As a result, Qin Anquan, Qin Anshou, Qin Duanliang (Anshou's son and Anquan's nephew), the brothers, father, son, uncle and nephew, and the partners Liu Yifa, Zhu Deyun, Cui Su, etc. six people, were led by Tang Faren, together with noodle shop clerks Tang Maotou, Tang Tongfa, Tang Faxian, Pan Jinzhong, etc., using dough sticks to break their heads, blood flowing like pillars. The Songshan Road Patrol Room obtained a report and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene, arresting the perpetrators and confiscating the murder weapon, wooden sticks, and brought them into the police station. The next day, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Special Second District Court, where Magistrate Zhu Chuzhe conducted the trial. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer for the French Concession Administration, stated the facts of the case, filed a public prosecution on charges of armed assault, requested a postponement, and re-interrogated after the investigation. The injured Liu Yifa was seriously injured and is now being treated in the hospital, so he did not arrive in court. Qin Anquan and others who were also injured, were all hit on the head and injured. It is requested to investigate. Tang Faren testified that because the second landlord repeatedly ordered the civilians to return the property, he resented it in his heart. Yesterday, the shop clerk urinated in the doorway, causing a conflict with Qin Xiaokai. They then took the opportunity to commit violence, falsely accusing us of assault. In fact, the civilians and shop assistants were also seriously injured. It is requested to examine the injuries. After reviewing the confessions, the court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody, and ordered the victims to submit to a forensic examination, and re-interrogate on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<h3>Owner of the Tianqiao Hotel Robbed; Internal Line from Tea Boy; Seven Irrelevant People Released First; Main Criminal at Large, Remaining Detained Pending Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>At about 1:00 p.m. on December 24 last year, the bedroom of Xu Dexiang, the Ningbo owner of the Tianqiao Hotel at No. 58 North Henan Road, was suddenly broken into by several bandits, who seized 6,210 yuan in legal tender from Xu's basket under the bed. They threatened the tea boys with guns to prevent them from making a sound, and then fled. Shang Wu, the Chinese Detective Captain, and Wang Youshan, the detective, of the Huisi Police Station, had arrested Ningbo bandits Fang Huichun, Chai Qingxiang, Mao Abing, Jin Afu, Yang Ansheng, and suspects Ye Huiyuan and the woman Lu Shen, a total of 16 men and women, at No. 19 North Henan Road and No. 6 Baokang Lane on Beijing Road. They were sent to the First Special District Court with a real handgun and four bullets, as well as a fake gun, and placed under investigation. The other morning, Magistrate Huang Risheng came to Criminal Court No. 3 to review the case. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, said that after clarifying in the middle of the postponement that Ye Huiyuan, Xu Derong, Wang Jintang, Fan Ruixiang, Wang Xingwang, Jin Axing, and the woman Lu Shen and other seven people were irrelevant, he asked to release them first. The court approved this and said that the hidden money of Xu Dexiang, the owner of Tianqiao Hotel, was robbed by the defendants Ji Acai, Mao Abing, Jin Afu, Yang Ansheng, and Wang Azhi who was at large and two unnamed others. Jin Afu and Yang Ansheng were the internal contacts. Jin was a fishmonger living in the hotel, and Yang was a tea boy who was dismissed a month ago. Knowing that the legal currency was hidden in the basket under the bed of the hotel owner Xu Dexiang, they conspired with Ji Acai and Mao Abing. Mao invited the fugitive leader Wang Azhi and two unnamed others to do this robbery. Afterwards, Ji Acai and Mao Abing each got 20 yuan, Jin Afu got 40 yuan, and Yang Ansheng got 50 yuan. The remaining Fang Huichun and five others are related to the case of Ji Acai's robbery of a resident's property at No. 17 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, etc. After Magistrate Huang interrogated the defendants, their confessions were ambiguous, and they were still returned to custody, to be verified later.</p>

<h3>The Grand Conspiracy to Eliminate the Chinese Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Wu Ma</p>
<p>I. Talking About the Past and Two Premises</p>
<p>Since the westward movement of the National Revolutionary Army, the Jiangzhe area, which has long been known as the center of the Chinese silk industry, has successively fallen. At that time, due to the urgency of the situation and the insufficient preparation by the authorities, many silk enterprises that should have been moved inland were left in the war zone. Among them, besides the silk factories, the most noteworthy are, of course, the silkworm egg production farms. We know that the silk factories in the war zone, under the threat of the Japanese and the flattery of several silk industry traitors, are officially working as economic slaves for the Japanese in the name of "cooperation with the Central China Silk Company." For example, the silk factories in Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places are currently in operation, but this only shows that the Japanese oppression has increased and the exploitation has deepened. Who can say how much benefit the many traitorous scoundrels have received from the Japanese, whether in terms of economy or reputation? We can understand this even more from the various harsh conditions and painful experiences of the silk factories in Wuxi after the so-called "cooperation." However, in the past year, the silkworm egg industry in the war zone, on the one hand, was because the Japanese were busy at the time, using the "Central China Company" to seize silk factories in the war zone, and had no time to take care of the egg farms; on the other hand, it was also because the egg production industry did not have scoundrels like Zhang Zizhen and Qian Fenghao in Wuxi. Although there were also people who communicated with the puppet government, but on the whole, they were able to maintain the dignity and integrity of the Republic of China's silkworm egg production farms. This is the evaluation of the silkworm egg industry in the war zone for their perseverance and struggle under such difficult circumstances in the past year!</p>
<p>However, the occupied area is, after all, an occupied area. The Japanese conspiracy against the entire China is ultimately fierce and vicious, and people like You Xiaobiao (the chief of the second section of the Construction Department of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government and concurrently a technician, and concurrently the director of the sericulture control office, who is actually the highest authoritative person in the sericulture administration of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government) are ultimately nothing more than tail-wagging traitors. To continue to operate the silkworm egg production business in the occupied area according to the previous policy, or to maintain the status of the silkworm egg production farms under the protection of people like You Xiaobiao, or even to take the opportunity to obtain some benefits, are all delusional dreams. Because in terms of business: (1) When the nest is overturned, no eggs are left intact, (2) The slaves will never have the guts to interfere with the "master" (?) and participate in discussions. These are two premises that the silkworm egg industry in the war zone should fully recognize.</p>
<p>Therefore: Let us further discuss the "Central China Silk Company's" recent offensive against the silkworm egg production industry in the war zone:</p>
<p>II. Five Conditions for Extinction</p>
<p>Recently, in order to implement the control of the silkworm egg industry in the war zone, and to achieve its goal of seizing or destroying the entire Jiangzhe silk industry, the "Central China Silk Company" has proposed "cooperation" to the Hushuguan Dayou Silkworm Egg Production Farm, which has long been known as the oldest and largest brand in Jiangzhe. This is the first shot fired by the Japanese against the egg farms in the war zone. There is no doubt that it will be promoted to all the egg farms in the Jiangzhe war zone. The conditions for cooperation are tentatively drafted into five articles, which are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The original seeds shall be purchased from the company and shall not be reproduced or transferred.</p>
<p>(2) The company shall appoint technical guidance, and the farm shall pay the salary.</p>
<p>(3) The disease rate shall not exceed three per thousand.</p>
<p>(4) The silkworm eggs produced shall be sold by the company and shall not be sold or transferred to others. Half of the payment for the eggs shall be paid upon delivery, and the remainder shall be paid after July for spring eggs and after October for autumn eggs.</p>
<p>(5) If the silkworm eggs issued are of poor quality, the farm shall be responsible for compensation.</p>
<p>Among the five conditions, the first, fourth, and fifth are the most vicious, and the second and third are only the auxiliary of these three. They are further analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the first article, it actually contains three sinister meanings. First: Of course, it is to control the silkworm varieties in the war zone, so that the excellent varieties originally cultivated by several larger egg farms will tend to be eliminated. In this way, on the one hand, various egg farms will not be able to obtain original seeds for breeding to produce ordinary silkworm eggs without cooperating with the "Central China Silk Company." In other words: they can only rely on the Japanese. Then, the existence or extinction of the silk industry can also be completely controlled by the Japanese depending on whether or not the Japanese provide original seeds. Second: Since the war, Japan has restricted the import of wool, but because of the barrenness of Japan's wool production, it has had to seek other remedial measures. Therefore, there is the so-called rush wool, that is, the promotion of a fiber that is similar to wool after treating rush with chemicals. However, because the rush used as the raw material for rush wool is not only not as good as the rush used for silk production, but is instead suitable for cotton rush that is not suitable for silk production; therefore, after the promotion of breeding in the country, it was met with fierce opposition from the silk production industry, the reason being that the promotion of this inferior raw material rush will inevitably greatly affect the production of high-quality rush used for silk production. Therefore, if the Japanese control the original seeds in the Jiangzhe war zone, so that all varieties purchase their products, they can of course take the opportunity to import these varieties into the war zone. On the one hand, they can make the Chinese in the war zone produce raw materials for them to achieve their goal of exploitation, and on the other hand, they can also alleviate the opposition of the domestic silk production industry. The third is that the Japanese have always regarded China as their silk enemy country, because China has vast land, abundant manpower, and the silk industry still has great development potential, while Japan is the opposite. Precisely because of this, the threat to Japan's silk kingdom is also the greatest. Therefore, after the fall of Jiangzhe, the main area of China's silk industry, the Japanese government has repeatedly sent domestic silk academic authorities, such as Kogure of Donggao Silk, Fukumoto, and Hayashi Teizo of Ueda, to investigate and inspect one after another, in order to obtain an overall policy for China's silk industry. At that time, there were two kinds of Japanese theories: complete elimination and development. However, the Japanese conspiracy now is to adopt the elimination of development. That is, to carry out controlled development in the Jiangzhe and other war zones; except for the Japanese, the Chinese have no buying and selling relationship with other foreign countries; so that the status of Chinese silk in the world consumer market is eliminated, so that there is no need to worry about the competition between Chinese silk and Japanese silk, and the treasure of the silk industry in the war zone can be obtained. Of course, this goal can be easily achieved by controlling the original seeds in the war zone. The most obvious example is that if the varieties of silkworms that are not suitable for silk production are promoted to the war zone, then the silk factories in Shanghai and the small silk factories in the war zone will not be able to and will not bother to collect the raw material rush produced in the war zone, because this kind of rush is no longer the raw material needed for silk production. This is the so-called "establishing a century-old plan" that the Japanese are shouting loudly! It is also the face of the so-called "economic cooperation" of the Japanese government!</p>
<p>Regarding the second article: The silkworm egg farm not only raises a Japanese in vain, which increases a part of the economic burden; but also, just like the so-called "three Tartars in ten households" in the Yuan Dynasty, this Japanese also has the power to manage the silkworm egg farm and monitor the actions of the Chinese. He is simply the "Taishang Huang" of the silkworm egg farm.</p>
<p>The restriction of the third article is actually a trap to force the egg farm to hire Japanese, and at the same time, the ordinary silkworm eggs in Japan will also have a chance to be dumped in China. Because the past regulations on the disease rate: 20% was burned, and 3% was re-examined; now the disease rate must not exceed three per thousand. On the one hand, it is to make the egg farm feel afraid and feel that it is necessary to hire Japanese technicians. On the other hand, the degree of disease rate inspection is increased, which can reduce the qualified number of ordinary silkworm eggs in the war zone, and then the production volume will also decrease; so that the ordinary silkworm eggs in Japan can be transported to the war zone to exchange for Chinese money. And ensuring that Japan's raw material policy will not fail due to poor silkworm crops is only a secondary matter.</p>
<p>The fourth article controls the production and sales of silkworm eggs, seizes the economy of silkworm eggs, and turns various egg farms into a production machine of the Central China Silk Company—no, machines still have to spend money to buy, and huge capital must be invested; this is simply the serf in the Middle Ages, in addition to desperately doing production work to earn money for the "master," you have to eat when the "master" wants to give you food, and you have to drink porridge when the "master" wants to give you porridge, and you have no choice but to rely on the "Central China Silk Company" of the "master." Because once the production and sales are organized, the relationship between the egg farm and the farmers is completely eliminated, and the silkworm egg farm only has a relationship with the "Central China Silk Company." Isn't this so that the amount of egg price and whether the "Central China Silk Company" should give the egg farm a price, etc., are all decided by the "Company" at will; and the "Central China Silk Company" can directly exchange the silkworm eggs for the farmers' legal currency with military tickets or counterfeit currency to the egg farm. In this way, isn't the silkworm egg farm still a vassal of the Japanese?</p>
<p>Regarding the fifth article: It seems to be beneficial to the farmers, but when everything is in the hands of the Japanese, the silkworm egg farm is only responsible to the "Central China Silk Company." Therefore, the so-called compensation is, in terms of procedures: of course, the silkworm egg farm must first compensate the "Central China Silk Company," and then the "Central China Silk Company" will compensate the farmers. In this way: after a silkworm season ends, the egg price that the "Central China Silk Company" wants to pay to the egg farm can be used as a pretext for poor results, as a reason to default on half of the egg price; and even force the egg farm to compensate for the losses many times over; as for the farmers who are under the oppressive force of the "Japanese puppet," they originally see the Japanese and do not even have time to hide and run away. Who would dare to look for the Japanese because the silkworm crop is not abundant? Even if we take a step back: the Japanese really have the intention to compensate the farmers for their losses.</p>
<p>In short: Although the conditions are only five, they are already thoroughly vicious and fierce, enough to destroy the original silk foundation of China without leaving any traces. If the operators of the silkworm egg farms in the war zone still have a little conscience, if they can still look a little further, they should resolutely refuse.</p>
<p>III. Two Lines for the Future</p>
<p>I heard that after obtaining these superior cooperation conditions, the Dayou Silkworm Egg Farm did not accept them resolutely at that time; but prepared to submit a request to the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Construction Department in the name of the Wuxian Silkworm Egg Industry Guild to express their opposition. The egg farm's disapproval of cooperation with the Japanese is, of course, a gratifying phenomenon; but merely asking for the assistance of the puppet government, we don't care whether this method is applied properly or not, but in terms of effect alone, it is absolutely not enough. Because the traitors are too busy obeying "their master," where would they dare to offer any opinions? This kind of error in understanding seems too inappropriate in the present situation of the total national mobilization of the all-out war of resistance! Then, how should various egg farms deal with it under this vicious oppression? I can say that there is no other way except for absolute non-cooperation. However, the so-called non-cooperation here is not just a matter of passively shutting down the silkworm egg farm, because in this way, the fierce Japanese will use the valuation method to take your silkworm rearing rooms, silkworm rearing equipment, mulberry gardens, etc., as fixed capital, and they will take over the operation. Wouldn't this be more in line with their vicious plan? Therefore, for the current plan, the silkworm egg production farms in the war zone must actively adopt two lines: moving to the guerrilla force area and moving to the rear. The former is to move the movable things as far as possible to the area controlled by the guerrilla forces, in order to prepare for the establishment of the egg production business in the guerrilla area, and at the same time, to completely or partially destroy the immovable things such as silkworm rearing rooms and cocoon rearing rooms, in order to cut off the Japanese's covetous intentions. We know that in the war zone, except for reluctantly maintaining a few transportation lines and larger cities, the other vast rural areas are under the control of the Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, it is no problem for the egg farm to move to the guerrilla area to operate as long as it is willing to give up the current equipment. Moreover, for several egg farms silkworm eggs that are deeply trusted by farmers, such as the Tiger Brand silkworm eggs of Dayou Egg Farm in Hushuguan, the Triangle Brand silkworm eggs of Renxu Hall, and the Three Gourd Brand silkworm eggs of Sanwu Hall in Wuxi, etc., they can still maintain their original status among the farmers in the war zone without being eliminated. Even after driving away the Japanese in the future, it will be an excellent foundation for expansion.</p>
<p>The latter is to move the worthy (please note the word worthy) movable things to the rear, such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces, as much as possible and as quickly as possible, in order to cooperate with the government to develop the silk industry in the southwest. At the same time, the silkworm rearing rooms, etc., should be burned down to avoid being used by the Japanese. Because the government has repeatedly stated that civilian capital and technology are very much needed, and this is also the time when all the people of the country should do their best. All kinds of production enterprises should follow the government's westward movement. Except for those who are directly engaged in guerrilla work and those who are indirectly disrupting the Japanese control business, there is no reason to live in the occupied area. Now, it is also the time when the occupied area is not allowed to linger. Then, except for moving to the guerrilla force area, there is no doubt that it is only to join the silk production camp in the rear. Fortunately, with the past experience of the silk egg industry in Jiangzhe, whether in terms of management or technology, it is enough to do pioneering work in an area where the silk industry is barren, not to mention the government's assistance.</p>
<p>(I think some larger egg farms have enough strength to advance on both lines at the same time.)</p>
<p>In short, if we can resolutely adopt these two lines as an emergency countermeasure under the current oppressive force of the Japanese, then we can still gain something even if we lose something at the beginning. If we are mad and willing to be economic slaves under the name of "cooperation" with the Japanese, following the same disastrous road of the silk factories in Wuxi and other places, then not only will the operators of the silkworm egg farms be discredited and become the scum of the silk industry; but also the sinners of the Chinese nation! Whether it is meritorious or non-meritorious, it is all in this moment. At this moment when the Japanese are starting to attack the silkworm egg production farms in the war zone, and the silkworm egg farms themselves have not betrayed China and are willing to be vassals of the Japanese, I respectfully reveal what I know in the newspaper to expose the Japanese conspiracy against the silkworm egg industry in the war zone, and to promote the rapid and profound awakening of the silkworm egg industry!</p>

<h3>Finance: English Pure Gold Continues to Rise; Jewelry Gold Remains at the Original Price</h3>
<p>Because of the weekly holiday, there was no trading on the cash hot red market yesterday. The selling price was still around 2,020 yuan, which was the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>The selling price of silver jewelry gold is also still at the original price of 205 yuan per tael. The new counterparts offer 203 yuan, and the purchase price is 197 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 21st: English pure gold rose by one and a half pence per ounce due to the weakening of the British pound, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, and eight and a half pence.</p>
<h3>Big Spreads, Near and Far, All Up</h3>
<p>Twenty-first, London dispatch: Indian and speculative buyers are active in the silver market, while sellers are watching. However, the market situation is still stable. Large bars of silver, both near and far, are up 125. Also, New York dispatch: American silver prices remain quoted but not traded. Furthermore, Bombay dispatch: The Indian silver market is semi-quiet; spot prices continue to rise by one anna, while near and far futures remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grain: Variable Prices Ultimately Rise One Dime Due to Scarce Inventory</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Rice source delivered a total of No. 12 grade rice downstream, with 6,000-7,000 bags of carload steamed buns. Sales were sluggish in both the local market and among hoarders. However, sellers, seeing the overcast and rainy weather, which suggests the possibility of snow, were firm in their intentions, resulting in limited transactions. The market for thick and thin Japonica rice was slightly better. The situation for Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian rice remained similar to before. Variable prices, however, were active in sales and lacked supply, making the situation buoyant and prices increasing by one dime.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Indian Cotton Weekend Statistics</h3>
<p>Bombay dispatch: The Indian cotton statistics from September 1st of last year to January 21st of this year are listed below:</p>
<p>(Unit: 1,000 bales, each bale weighing 400 pounds)</p>
<p>|                         | Bombay | Karachi |</p>
<p>| :---------------------- | :----- | :------ |</p>
<p>| Cumulative Receipts     | 939    | 711     |</p>
<p>| Exports to Europe       | 106    | 191     |</p>
<p>| Exports to China        | 35     | 38      |</p>
<p>| Exports to Japan        | 407    | 88      |</p>
<p>| Exports to Other Regions | 15     | 152     |</p>
<p>| Weekend Inventory       | 825    | 394     |</p>
<h3>Coal: Zhoushan Coal Exhausted, Large Shipments Arriving</h3>
<p>Household coal bricks, used for daily needs, are nearly exhausted. Winter sales have increased, but local factories are limited by the depletion of Wenzhou coal seams and cannot ship goods, leading to market demand exceeding supply and rising prices. Recently, a certain firm commissioned sailing ships to transport over 300,000 coal bricks from Zhoushan, which have now arrived. They are being offered to colleagues in the industry, divided into large, medium, and small sizes. Large size is 15 yuan per thousand, medium size is 13 yuan, and small size is 11 yuan. Wholesale delivery by colleagues incurs additional cartage fees.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Sales Strong</h3>
<p>Western sea cucumbers have been selling quite well recently, causing local inventories to shrink and quoted prices to tighten. For example, yesterday's offered prices were: selected strips of jade type, 133 yuan; wholesale, 120 yuan; Grade 1 jade, 126 yuan; Grade 2 jade, 118 yuan; Grade 3 jade, 110 yuan; Grade 4 jade, 99 yuan; Grade 5 jade, 89 yuan. Also, red sea cucumber wholesale was Grade 1, 140 yuan; Grade 2, 131 yuan; true Grade 3, 120 yuan; Grade 3, 104 yuan; Grade 4, 19 yuan; Grade 5, 77 yuan. Prices for mid-range jade sea cucumbers, such as Grades 3, 4, and 5, have each risen by 10 yuan, while red sea cucumbers have risen by more than 10 yuan previously.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Local Round Nails Fall to 16 Yuan</h3>
<p>Local factory round nails, among all hardware types, can be considered the most common. Because they are widely used, the market price fluctuations are quite significant. This product recently broke through the 16 yuan barrier and returned to 15 yuan 7.5 cents. Yesterday, 500-600 barrels were sold, purchased by merchants and construction crews. According to recent information from the factory, conditions are unusually weak, and they are willing to sell in bulk, so the internal market is quite sluggish. However, there are not many actual transactions, and the market situation is difficult to improve. It is reported that retail sales from local shops also amounted to 50-60 barrels yesterday, but the selling price was around 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Hangzhou White Chrysanthemum Arrivals Scarce</h3>
<p>Hangzhou white chrysanthemum is both a medicinal material and a tea chrysanthemum. Like the green tea we often drink, mixed with chrysanthemum, it has a clear, fragrant, and harmonious flavor, making it a fine product. Therefore, sales are also significant. It is reported that the previous shipment of 60-70 pieces, which were steamed flower buns (each containing one market catty), has already been purchased by tea merchants, at a price of 75 yuan. However, sources are scarce, and external expenses are high, increasing costs. The current market price is 80 yuan, and the demand is quite brisk.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Local Silk Exports; Japanese Merchants Hold Key Position; The Result of Forcible "Organization"; Silk Market Thrives in the Last Half-Month</h3>
<p>In late December of last year and the first half of this month, both the export and market price aspects of local silk showed good trends. For example, in terms of exports, each month for the past three months has maintained a record of 4,000 piculs. In terms of market price, each month has also been rising. As of January 15th, it has felt even more firm and prosperous. However, regarding exports, because silk from the Wuxi area has been forcibly controlled, all silk from that region is exclusively exported by Japanese merchants. In recent months, the percentage of the total export volume accounted for by various foreign firms has shifted dramatically. Mitsui, from a very backward position after the war, has used the power of "control" to leap to become the main player in the Shanghai silk export industry, accounting for 20% of the silk export volume among the twenty exporting foreign firms. The silk prices and export volume for the first half of this month are listed below:</p>
<p>White Filature XB13/15: 1460 yuan</p>
<p>White Filature XB16/18: 1260 yuan</p>
<p>White Filature XB20/22: 1300 yuan</p>
<p>Tussah A Grade—: 810 yuan</p>
<p>Tussah GA—: 700 yuan</p>
<p>Silk Shipped to Europe: 542 piculs</p>
<p>Silk Shipped to India: 20 piculs</p>
<p>Silk Shipped to America: 76 piculs</p>
<p>Total: 1423 piculs</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Tide Green Offered at Higher Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly tight. The Guild's designated price for No. 24 coarse Dutch white spot goods rose by five cents, trading at 24 yuan 6.5 cents; transit goods rose by 7.5 cents, designated at 16 yuan 7.5 cents; goods from local warehouses were 24 yuan 8.5 cents. Dutch red did not show more strength, with spot goods at 16 yuan 6 cents and transit goods at 11 yuan. Taikoo Crystal White B Mark goods from Western warehouses remained at 23 yuan 9.5 cents. China Sugar Yingang green brand new goods were offered at 13 yuan 8 cents for over a hundred bags. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants offered 313 boxes of sliced green at 11 yuan 8 cents. Jian merchants reported via telegram that top-grade white sugar had recently risen by two yuan, so quoted prices followed suit, but the price increase here has not yet fully passed through, and there are still few deals being made.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor: A Statement from a Chinese Employee of a Foreign Bank</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Yesterday, I read in your newspaper's "Commercial News" column an article titled "Everyone in the Banking Industry is Making a Fortune," which stated, "Employees of foreign banks have monthly surpluses and foreign exchange to spare, abandoning foreign blessings; in fact, it is still the blessing of the government, so everyone is all smiles." In reality, foreign bank employees are wronged and treated unfairly. Your newspaper's understanding of the situation in foreign banks is inevitably unclear. I specifically request a correction to be provided for public view, so as not to lose sight of the truth. In foreign firms, Western employees do indeed have generous salaries, with ordinary employees generally earning 20,000 yuan annually; there are many items included in this, such as pension funds, car expenses, medical expenses, rental expenses, and foreign exchange subsidies. Among Chinese employees, the highest salaries are only 200 yuan per month, with an end-of-year bonus equal to only one month's salary! They are subjected to unreasonable exploitation by compradores; for example, a certain comprador named Long in a major foreign bank earns a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan and deducts 7,000-8,000 yuan from the salaries of various employees, so his annual income is no less than 100,000 yuan. He enjoys a lavish lifestyle and is attended by six or seven servants. This year, with the pound skyrocketing, he hoarded 3 million yuan in foreign exchange, making a fortune from the national crisis. However, he is stingy by nature and would not contribute a single cent to refugee relief or national crisis donations; he would not even lend money to relatives and friends (omission) Ordinary Chinese employees of foreign banks face a difficult life, toiling like oxen and horses, suffering oppression, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. How can it be said that they are all smiles? Yours sincerely, Xia Yisheng, January 21st.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the article "Everyone in the Banking Industry is Making a Fortune," we have received many phone calls and letters requesting the newspaper to pay more attention to such news. However, due to space constraints, it is difficult to publish all daily news, and it is impossible to publish everything. The other day, we received a letter from Mr. Xia stating that Chinese employees of foreign banks are not all "all smiles" and that many are toiling like oxen and horses, requesting a correction. It should be published to comply with convention. If there are any new and important letters in the future, please inform us, and we will still select the most important ones for disclosure, to fulfill our duty. - Editor</p>

<h3>Scotto Cup: Lido Wins the Right to Compete; Defeats Larks Six to Two; Leading Two to Zero in the First Half</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning was overcast, but the afternoon suddenly cleared up, and the second round of the Scotto Cup finals was successfully concluded. Lido and Larks met at Jiaozhou Park. The field was unusually muddy, and the audience was three times larger than at Yiyuan in the morning. Lido, as a Group C team, surprisingly eliminated the Group A powerhouse Larks by a large score of six to two and won the right to compete in the Scotto Cup semi-finals. Lido led two to zero in the first half. The teams that have now qualified for the semi-finals are Lido, West Post, St. Francis, and East Celle. Good luck to them. There are high hopes for the champion of this Scotto Cup.</p>
<p>Taking the Lead First; Leading by Two Goals</p>
<p>Lido faced the wind and kicked off first. Fafan Xiao made a deep incursion, but Lu Zhongen was quick and kicked the ball out of danger. After that, the situation was completely under Lido's control. Fafan Xiao was closely guarded by Yang Jinling and had no room to move. Seeing Lido's activity, Zhang Lingen occasionally lost his footing, and Mike Deng descended like lightning, shooting near the goal. Everyone thought it was certain to score, but unexpectedly, it went wide. In the 18th minute, Sun Jinshun passed to Jiang Chao, who cut into the center. Li Yichen shot low from the penalty spot into the right corner, opening the scoring. The Larks tried hard to counterattack. Pegge took a free kick outside the penalty area, and Lu Zhongen punched it out. Bo Lining shot hard near the goal, but Lu Zhongen managed to catch it, to everyone's delight. In the 25th minute, Zhang Mingsheng shot, and Atoklas blocked it on the ground, barely touching the ball. Cao Qiuting caught up and kicked it right into the net, making it two to zero. Four minutes later, Meng Yiliang fouled and conceded a penalty. Pegge took the kick, but it flew wide. The Larks' morale was even lower. As the half-time whistle blew, Lido led by two goals.</p>
<p>Tense Situation; Winning Big in the Middle</p>
<p>After the second half, the Larks made major positional changes. Madar was reassigned to left-back, Fafan Xiao filled in at right-wing, Xue Ni Qinggu kicked Ji, and Greenber was reassigned to midfield. Sure enough, they were full of energy. In the 2nd minute, Bo Lining headed the ball, and Fafan Xiao kicked it in, making it two to one. Just as they hoped to improve further, in the 7th minute, Greenber pulled someone down in the penalty area and conceded a penalty. Sun Tie Tui took the kick, but it was saved. Fortunately, Cao Qiuting hooked it in, and before Atoglas could get up, Sun Jinshun had rolled into the net with the ball, making it three to one. Lido was still leading by two goals. The Larks continued their efforts, and in the 16th minute, the Larks finally had a free kick opportunity at the 20-yard mark. Fafan Xiao kicked the ball, which bounced off the goalpost, and Bo Lining added a kick, which was unstoppable, making it three to two. The score was close. Li Yichen was also injured and unable to walk well, making the situation quite precarious. Holding on until the 34th minute, Zhang Mingsheng passed to Shi Yongnan, who crossed it to the center. Li Yichen shot low at the 10-yard mark, making it four to two and stabilizing the situation. Five minutes later, Li Yichen deliberately lost his footing, and Jiang Chao poked the ball in, breaking the enemy's goal again, making it five to two. Victory was assured. In the last minute, Cao Qiuting crossed, and Zhang Mingsheng darted in and shot low, making it six to two and adding to the victory. The final whistle blew, and the Larks were miserably eliminated, while Lido won the right to compete in the semi-finals.</p>
<h3>Poor Luck; Good Opportunities Become a Painted Cake; Donghua Suffers a Miserable Defeat Yesterday; Lost Two to Four to East Celle; The Scotto Cup Must Wait Until Next Year</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the drizzle was like silk. The second week of the East China and East Celle Scotto Cup game at Yiyuan was still held as usual. Only three to four hundred spectators came, and Donghua's luck was as bleak as the weather. Under the double pressure of the muddy field and heavy ball, they were miserably eliminated by the British army by two to four. Losing three goals in the first half was a fatal blow.</p>
<p>Losing Three Goals in a Row; Morale Plummets</p>
<p>At the center line kick-off, in the 5th minute, Pan JieTuo kicked a high ball directly under the goal. Zhou Dayun slapped it out with both hands, and Mike Luo Dui slanted over and put it in, Donghua losing a city first. So, the three armies used their lives, and they fought hard to counterattack. Dai Wanwu went straight to the front line, and A Dai took the opportunity to pass to the left. A Wan shot, but it flew over the crossbar, making it feel a pity. From then on, the British army was very rampant. In the 15th minute, Mike Luo Tuo raised his foot and was shut out, but Da Yun blocked it with his foot, but he gave a spear to others, and Bao Duoke's man arrived, and the foot arrived. The door was opened again, two to zero. Dai Wanwu triangulated and counterattacked the enemy's nest. A Dai headed, Bing Hao went forward, Hess was slippery and fell to the ground, but it was a miss again, and the ball was not flowing. Bing Hao pulled and shot, but it hit the right wood. Before long, Youliang kicked out a corner kick, and A Dai headed, but it was high above the plane. After that, Youliang passed the two passes of Austin and Hailiesun and transported to the center. The British army had no reinforcements in front and was empty behind, but Dai Wu lost his footing with each other and became a cake again. So, in the 36th minute, Flatai attacked Da Yun's right corner at the 20-yard mark. It was low and urgent. In the first half, the British army took an absolute advantage with a score of three to zero.</p>
<p>Bad Luck; One is like this</p>
<p>After the second half, Donghua greatly adjusted its position, Zhuang Zhao changed places, and Xu Cai also changed places. The situation suddenly improved. Although they encountered a dangerous situation in the first minute, the offensive was quite strong after that. A Dai first performed a long shot at the 24-yard mark. The ball was flat and urgent, and the shot was too accurate. It went straight into Hess's arms. Before long, the ball progressed from the right, Hailiesun lost his footing, and the gate was wide open. Dai Shen went straight down shoulder to shoulder, but his father's shot was one foot off. It was even more regrettable that when Youliang passed a foot, Shen Tuyan rushed to catch up, and he hooked the money at the bottom. The ball swept across the door, and A Dai Bing Hao rushed in on both sides. The people entered the net, but the ball rolled out of bounds. Hui hit it, almost turning against each other, but it became a corner kick, and the battle was fought again. The British army was quite exhausted. The front line was only Heil who launched a long shot at the 25-yard mark, which hit the post and bounced back. The rear was still in a state of panic. Hess held the ball and walked four steps, and was fined for picking up the fence. It was only two yards away from the door, and the result was that they all fell to the ground, but the ball did not enter. It had a great rugby flavor. Under this general attack by Donghua, in the 29th minute, Youliang cut into the center, and Bing Hao headed the ball to A Dai, who hit it at the 14-yard mark, tying the score to one to three. Xianghua changed positions with Bing Hao, and in the 43rd minute, Shiyan passed to Jia, Jia passed to Wan, and A Wan passed it back to Cheng Dong, and sent it to the front of the door. Shen Shiyan poked it in, two to three, and they were only one goal behind. Unfortunately, there were only two minutes left until the end, and Flatai suddenly shot from the 18-yard mark, and Da Yun did not catch it with his eyes. Dong's good dream was not realized, and he was miserably eliminated from the second week of the Cup with a score of two to four.</p>

<h3>Si Shang Cup Small Ball Game Yesterday; China Beats Baili</h3>
<p>In another Si Shang Zhong Cup small football match, there were originally three games yesterday, but the fields could not be used after the rain, so the first game between Huaxing and Jinke was postponed. The remaining two games were held as scheduled due to the improved weather in the afternoon. Shenqu vs. Zhongdui of the Shang Team took the stage first. After the start of the game, Shenqu Wang Guoquan, Shao Miaorong, Zhang Zhaopeng, and Sun Hanxing scored four goals in a row. Zhongdui Luo Lingshou pulled back a city, and Shenqu was ahead with a score of four to one in the first half. In the second half, Zhongdui Xu Bangjie and Shenqu Chen Yuegan each scored a goal. Time expired, and Shenqu triumphed with a score of five to two. In the last game, B of Paramen vs. China, both sides had famous generals, and the performance was especially wonderful. In the first half, China Zhuang Shifang kicked in a goal from outside the 20-yard mark, and China took the lead with a score of one to zero in the first half.

<h3>Pudong Guerrilla Area; Restoring County Elementary Schools; Counting Fengnan and Chuan Three Counties</h3>
<p>Education in the Pudong guerrilla area has been stagnated for a long time since the war. Except for the few puppet "Dadao Elementary Schools" along the Pudong coast, which rely on the power of the Japanese army to protect them and implement a kind of enslaved education to repay their masters, the county elementary schools in the vast area controlled by the Hua Fang guerrilla team have not been restored. It is now heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that it is inappropriate to waste the children's studies for a long time. In the blink of an eye, the second semester of the 27th year will begin again, and it is necessary to take this opportunity to restore them separately. The heads of Fengnan and Chuan Three Counties have been instructed to prepare for the opening of county elementary schools as soon as possible within the possible range, and to take in free students as the principle, and not to charge any tuition or book fees. Yu Taosheng, the head of Nanhui County, has ordered that a part of the salt tax be allocated as educational expenses for the next semester, and the original county schools will be opened. However, the salaries of teachers and staff are extremely meager, with the principal receiving 15 yuan and the teachers receiving 14 yuan, in order to comply with the principle of reducing government expenses during the war of resistance. Personnel will also be sent to Shanghai to purchase a large number of textbooks.</p>

<p>School Overview</p>
<h3>Xin Bei Middle School</h3>
<p>Xin Bei Middle School in this city is a reorganized version of the former Municipal Shi Bei Middle School. The original Municipal Shi Bei Middle School was located in Zhabei, with extensive school buildings and a student body of seven to eight hundred, making it one of the city's famous municipal middle schools. After the August 13th incident, the school buildings were located in the war zone, so it was moved to the concession to resume classes. Later, it was reorganized under orders and renamed Xin Bei Middle School. A school board was established, with Guo Mingjiu from the banking industry serving as Chairman and Dr. Lu Xirong and others serving as school board members. Xu Zexiang (Father Pei), the former supervisor of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, succeeded as principal, and classes continued at 183 Nanyang Road. It was registered with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and filed with the Ministry of Education. During the summer vacation, the school moved to a foreign-style house at 18, Alley 11, Jiaozhou Road, as its school building, with a central location. The total number of high school, junior high school, and kindergarten teacher training students reached 264, divided into seven classes: three high school classes, three junior high school classes, and one kindergarten teacher training class. This has been specially filed with the Ministry of Education. The school's teaching and management have always been extremely strict, and diligence has been emphasized recently. In terms of moral education, the school follows the Ministry's orders to implement a tutor system, establishing various daily life rules to ensure that students strictly adhere to them. Tutors examine the students' situation daily and provide guidance as needed. In addition, extracurricular activities and social services are actively pursued. As for the faculty, in addition to the former Shi Bei Middle School faculty, including Fan Zeou (current secretary of the principal's office), Zhang Dichchen (director of administrative affairs), Tong Dihua (chief accountant), Zhao Xiang (English teacher), Zhang Shuqin (Chinese teacher), Ji Hanzhang (English teacher), Hu Yiping (mathematics teacher), Zhang Jichuan (mathematics teacher), Shen Jiahui, and Jiang Lin, the school also hired Gu Huihua, former vice principal of Qiao Guang Middle School, as Director of Studies; Zhang Shizhi, Bachelor of Laws from Great China University, as Director of Moral Education; Han Kepi, Bachelor of Education from Great China University, as Secretary; Ma Yuanwu, Bachelor of Science from Soochow University, as Physics and Chemistry teacher; Xue Hongjun, graduate of Central University, as Biology teacher; He Xianqi, former professor at Great China University, as History and Geography teacher; Cai Tongwen, graduate of Fudan University, as Chinese teacher; and Shao Wujiu, lecturer at Great China University, as Kindergarten Teacher Training Education teacher.

<h3>"Enemy Horses"</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>——New Impressions from a Wartime Journey——</p>
<p>A gentleman came here and asked me, "When the enemy's horses are captured by our army, do they lower their heads to express shame and repentance?" I was very ashamed, not only had I never seen it, I had never even heard of it. I showed him many photos of our generals riding captured enemy horses, their heads held high, as if they had no remorse at all. However, it would be quite interesting to find an enemy horse that came from the battlefield and was determined to become a monk, but unfortunately, we don't have the good fortune to see that.</p>
<p>Since the gentleman brought up the topic of enemy horses, many friends who lived on the battlefield spoke of their own experiences. "In a village near Lanling, a squadron of enemy cavalry was surrounded by our army. By the third day, it was clear that there was no hope of breaking through the strong iron ring. On the fourth morning, an enemy plane flew low over the village and dropped a signal. An hour after the plane flew back, there was a burst of intermittent gunfire in the village, followed by silence. Soon after, our army broke into the village, finding more than a dozen enemy soldiers and more than fifty enemy horses. Some of the horses had only one ear left, and others had only one eye left, standing there dripping with blood. Some of them truly became one-eyed dragons, and they are still pulling carts in our herd. The enemy's horses look very good, plump and with shiny coats."</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff's recollection of what he saw in southern Shandong sparked a new topic from the military commander, who said, "The enemy's horses are too beautiful to be useful. The horses sent to us by the 106th Division were enough to form a cavalry squadron. Among them, there were a dozen or so that were extremely beautiful. It is said that they were a precious breed of horse, and even their feed had to be brought from their own country. We couldn't afford to raise these young master horses, and we couldn't even lift them, so we had to let them starve to death there." The gentleman laughed and said, "The enemy's artists might be able to paint a picture of righteous horses, saying that those young master horses were captured but unyielding, and starved themselves to death." After a burst of laughter, I supplemented what the enemies themselves criticized about their horses in "Unkilled Soldiers." They said, "The Chinese mules and horses look like ghosts, thin and small, dragging one step after another. When it comes to long distances, especially on muddy and rugged roads, our top-notch horses are far inferior to those ghostly mules and horses, enduring hardship and walking steadily without collapsing." This is a general explanation of the fate of the Sino-Japanese war. The enemy's horses symbolize the enemy's fighting power.</p>
<p>When the staff officer was fighting in Lanfeng, he spent more than ten days in the cavalry column commanded by the notorious wandering Doihara, and he intercepted many horses one after another. The horse he rode and the horse the military commander rode were both taken from that time. His "enemy horse theory" is also quite interesting. He said, "The owner's personality is often expressed in the objects he loves. Young ladies like Pekingese dogs, and big thieves want to have a ferocious wolf-like dog. These are all reflections of the owner's personality. The enemy has a common idea about horses: these are 'military' horses, they must be fat and shiny, and they don't pay much attention to whether they are strong inside. We usually treat the enemy's horses as decorations. But when we go to the battlefield, I will choose a different one." Using the form of horses to portray the mentality of the nouveau riche is very profound and meaningful.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, there may have been people who saw this point. Wasn't Takahashi, the finance minister who was sacrificed in the February 26th incident, talking about the emptiness of their own economic foundation?</p>
<h3>Daladier: "Only My Share Remains"</h3>
<p>— Dai Cangqi</p>
<h3>Repentance</h3>
<p>— Lu Ming</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, I was awakened by the sound of rain outside the window, and I remembered Min. Min was driven out of here by me this evening.</p>
<p>Min is my friend, and also a friend of my roommates Shi and Ying. We three lived in a small room of less than five feet on each side, which was already cramped, and Min insisted on living here as well. At first, he only said three or four days and would leave immediately, and we reluctantly agreed out of consideration for our friendship. Although we three were living in a precarious situation, and the income from our labor was only enough to barely survive, Min was even worse off than us: he had a hand that could not work. At this time, he had to share a bowl of soup from his poor friends.</p>
<p>"Misery loves company," this "love" comes from emotion. Giving because of compassion is also slight and temporary. It was naturally impossible for Min to ask us to tighten our belts and support him for a long time!</p>
<p>Several times we explained our difficulties to him in a gentle manner. The room was small and our strength was weak, and we hoped that he would quickly find another way, but he always seemed to forget after listening. Day after day passed, and gradually we began to have hatred and annoyance for him.</p>
<p>A month passed and then another month, and now it was almost two months. We spent all our money on things that went into our stomachs, our rent was two months in arrears, and we thought that all these pains were Min's fault alone. If it weren't for him, we wouldn't be like this! So, tonight, we all got angry:</p>
<p>"Drive Min away!"</p>
<p>When Min came back from fetching water to prepare dinner, I spoke first according to the resolution we had just made:</p>
<p>"Min, there's no need to cook dinner. You have to leave here quickly!"</p>
<p>These sudden, serious, and resolute words shocked Min. He stared at me in astonishment, unable to say a word. "Leave quickly!" I ordered again, "If you stay any longer, you'll not only harm us by not having anything to eat, but we won't even have a place to live! Do you understand? If you understand, leave here quickly!"</p>
<p>He burst into tears, looking as pitiful as a lost lamb! But this not only did not arouse my pity, but ignited my anger! I shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Get out! You unlucky wretch!"</p>
<p>As I said that, I stood up and pushed him out the door. While struggling, he cried out in a trembling voice with tears in his eyes, "Where do you want me to go! Where do you want me to go!" "Go to your rich friends!..." I answered him with gritted teeth.</p>
<p>"I, I don't have... rich friends! The rich ones used to be my friends! Now, now they are willing to take me in! Poor friends who don't have money still value friendship and mix together..."</p>
<p>"Hmph! How can poor friends afford to entertain you, they will be exhausted themselves! Get out, you must get out..."</p>
<p>I pushed him out of the door. At this moment, he struggled like crazy, shouting: "Yun, Yun, think of the old days, I won't eat your food, let, let me occupy a bed in the corner..."</p>
<p>"Bang!" I closed the door and pretended not to hear or see him crying and shouting outside, hitting the door with his fists.</p>
<p>Min's cries gradually became hoarse and weak, and fell silent at some point.</p>
<p>But at this moment, God started to rain, and it was a heavy rain! I was awakened, and I couldn't help but remember Min! Min was driven away by me, and I was the one who made him sleep in the rain! It's my sin! I regret it!</p>
<p>I got out of bed and put on my clothes. The cold air of the winter midnight made me tremble! I lit the kerosene lamp, and the flickering flames drove away the darkness in the room! I listened intently, "Tick-tock of crickets," as if it was Min's vengeful cry to me. When I looked at the glass window on the wall, the raindrops were like arrows, shooting straight at the heart of the enemy! Without hesitation, I grabbed the lamp in one hand and opened the door of the room and the door of the house. I wanted to let Min walk into our warm little room. I am willing to kneel on the ground and ask him to punish me!</p>
<p>The cold rain hit my head, face, hands, and there was no sign of Min?</p>
<p>Min, Min! Where are you hiding under someone else's eaves, becoming a drowned rat, or have you stiffened in the thunderstorm?</p>
<p>Min! Your friend Yun deeply repents! The room is small, but it can still accommodate you, and we will die together if we starve! Come back, come back, come back to your poor friend's home, and let's fight and struggle together...</p>
<h3>The Mission of Eyes</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Writing articles: use your brain, use your hands, and also use your eyes.</p>
<p>Things written without eyes can only be written and read by yourself, and no one will want them. The structure of the article is good, and the words and sentences are beautiful and powerful, but it is full of empty words. There is no benefit to be gained from reading it, and it is more beneficial to close your eyes and sleep. Study Chinese? Who has the time to ponder and learn?</p>
<p>Society is multifaceted, and the phenomena of the human world are also unfathomable. You see some things, and I see some things. You experience some things, and I experience some things. What you see or experience may not be what I see or experience. We have the materials to describe our own understanding, knowledge, and even understanding of feelings. Think with your brain and write with your hands, but first you have to look with your eyes.</p>
<p>And how do you look? Sometimes the trivial matters around us and the surrounding situations cannot satisfy the needs of our pens. We feel that life is too ordinary, there is no material to write about, and there is no life record worthy of publication. Therefore, some people shout, "Material shortage!" Although some people instruct us, and some people tell us that there will never be an end to writing materials, and some people teach us how to use small raw materials and how to discover writing materials, there are still people shouting, "Material shortage!" It seems that the materials that can be written have been used up by others.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as you know how to look, you can create infinite good articles. Especially in today's epic era, you can find a lot of wonderful materials in every corner. After the tempering of thought and the rendering of the pen, you can complete the great mission of a literary man. However, it is easy to say, but difficult to do. Everyone is ambitious but unskilled, able to talk but not able to do. This is a fact, I don't deny it. However, I don't believe in the miracle of dreams blossoming and the strange genius who can write on horseback. One thing, one person, or a group of people, a group of things, should all be seen with your own eyes. After seeing it, you can't just scribble on paper. You have to use your brain to digest the feelings of your own eyes, and chew carefully from your own subjective position. When you can distinguish the taste, and then put effort into the pen, you have hope of achieving great success.</p>
<p>There are many literary swindlers in the literary world who use their half-understood things to promote themselves. As a result, they may deceive reputation, deceive status, and even deceive money. But in fact, at most they are just clever swindlers. Once exposed, they are even less valuable, and everyone will laugh silently.</p>
<p>We have eyes, eyes that can see things. We should use them well, live up to their mission, and let them help us solve the current major problem of "material shortage".</p>
<h3>Shao Bao Hu's War Merits in Pacifying the Japanese Pirates</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——Talk on National Novels</p>
<p>The last volume of Zhou Qingyuan's "Second Collection of West Lake" in the Ming Dynasty, namely Volume 34, is "Shao Bao Hu's War Merits in Pacifying the Japanese Pirates", and the "Important Coastal Defense" method is attached to the end. Is there a profound meaning in it? Why should I use the story of pacifying the Japanese pirates as the final chapter, and repeatedly tell readers the method of preventing the Japanese pirates?</p>
<p>Most of this short story is based on Mao Kun's "Complete Account of Suppressing and Eliminating Xu Hai" in the Ming Dynasty. In many places, it is only a change from classical Chinese to vernacular, with a little description added.</p>
<p>Among them, there is a section about the story of Wang Cuicao, which describes how a prostitute induces Xu Hai to surrender and kills Xu Hai, which is very moving. Her behavior is similar to that of the Fei palace maids in the late Ming Dynasty. Kunqu Opera "Assassinating the Tiger" is a famous drama often performed on stage, and Wang Cuicao should also be an excellent theatrical material.</p>
<p>Regarding Wang Cuicao, the anonymous "General Record of Pacifying the Japanese Pirates in the Southeast during the Jiajing Period" in the Ming Dynasty hardly mentioned it, and Zhu Jiude's "Brief History of the Japanese Change" in the Ming Dynasty only had these few sentences: "On the 19th day of the eighth month of the Jiajing 35th year, Hai knew that danger was imminent, and at the second watch of the night, he sent close guards to escort the two beloved concubines out of the nest to escape." The so-called two beloved concubines are Wang Cuicao and Lv Shu.</p>
<p>Wang Cuicao's ability is as follows: "Wang Cuicao was a prostitute from Linzi. When the Japanese pirates invaded Jiangnan, they plundered Cuicao. Xu Hai, the leader of the stronghold, loved her very much and respected her as his wife. All plans were made by Cuicao's instructions. Cuicao also pretended to agree, but secretly hoped for his failure. At that time, the Governor's Office sent Hua Laoren to persuade Hai to surrender. Hai was about to kill him, but Cuicao untied his bonds and gave him gold. He returned to tell the Governor's Office, and then sent Luo Zhongjun to persuade Hai, and increased the gold, jewels, and jade to secretly bribe Cuicao. Cuicao calmly said in the tent every day that great things must not be accomplished, it is better to surrender. Hai decided. The Governor's Office reorganized the army and pretended to surrender: They forced Hai's stronghold, Hai believed Cuicao's words and was not prepared. The officers and soldiers broke in suddenly and beheaded Hai. Cuicao was captured alive, and the Japanese pirates were annihilated. The Governor's Office gave Cuicao to the chieftain of Yongshun. Cuicao left and crossed the Qiantang River, sighing: "Ming Shan treated me well, and I lured and killed him for the sake of the country: killing one chieftain belongs to another chieftain, what face do I have to live?" She jumped into the river and died in the middle of the night." (Excerpt from Mao Kun's "Complete Account of Suppressing and Eliminating Xu Hai")</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian wants to adapt this matter into a new Peking opera. With his skills in writing "Liang Hongyu", writing Wang Cuicao's departure from Yema Chen Dong will surely have some witty remarks. However, in the original story, "Bribing Cuicao secretly with gold, jewels, and jade" (Ji Zhuqing's "History of Sino-Japanese Wars of All Ages" also said: "Several spies were sent to hold hairpins and earrings to leave two servants of Hai, and they persuaded Hai day and night.") inevitably lowered Wang Cuicao's status and aspirations. According to the context, since Wang Cuicao "pretended to agree, but secretly hoped for his failure" before, and then said "I lured and killed him for the sake of the country," it can be seen that her will had been decided long before she was bribed, and she made it clear that it was for the sake of the country, not because she was moved by gold, jewels, and jade. I hope that when Yuqian writes this drama in the future, he can emphasize that Wang Cuicao killed Xu Hai for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>Xu Hai was originally a Chinese, helping the tyrant to abuse others. This reminds us of the fishermen of Shidongkou in our country during the August 13th Shanghai battle, who led the enemy deep into the country, resulting in the loss of Luodian. Southern Jiangsu also lost the area around Suzhou, Wuxi, and Jiangyin quickly because the fishermen became traitors. Proving the past with the present is exactly the same. Since Yuqian has vividly portrayed Wang Zhi in "Liang Hongyu", then a big traitor like Xu Hai will surely be able to give us a "caricature".</p>

<h3>Relieving Beggar Children</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Recently, beggar children can be seen everywhere in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Some beggar children chase pedestrians on the side of the road to ask for money. Some beggar children sit on the ground and ask passers-by for money. Some beggar children ask for money from people waiting for buses and streetcars at the bus stops and streetcar stations. Some beggar children pick up vegetable peels and meat bones around the vegetable market. If the vegetable sellers or buyers are not careful, these beggar children will also do "shoplifting", stealing some vegetables and hiding them in their broken baskets.</p>
<p>Some beggar children rummage through barren land or trash cans for broken things, such as coal cinders, firewood, paper scraps, cloth scraps, cigarette cans, broken bottles, broken glass, etc. They pick up all the waste discarded by others and send it to secondhand stores in exchange for a few copper coins.</p>
<p>Why are there so many beggar children in Shanghai? There are two main categories: One category is refugees who have fled from the mainland to Shanghai, unable to make a living, so they force their children to beg with them. These beggar children help their parents to maintain their family life together. Another category is taught the skills of begging by "old men" (old beggars), and they ask passers-by for money. The money they beg is handed over to the old man. The old man specializes in doing the work of pouring out food buckets, pouring out the leftovers from restaurants and dividing them among his "disciples" (beggar children) to eat. At night, the old man takes care of his disciples to sleep in dirty alleys. These beggar children are helping the old beggars to ask for money. If they don't ask for money, they often get beaten, and sometimes they are beaten into cripples!</p>
<p>These beggar children are simply worse than slaves! It is said that there are one or two thousand beggar children in Shanghai. Their only way out is either starvation or banditry. From a humanitarian perspective or from a social perspective, we should urgently provide relief to beggar children, give them education and food.</p>
<p>The relief method is nothing more than setting up beggar children's education and training homes: the following is a simple method,</p>
<p>1.  Site: Choose a place close to poor residents, build dozens of shacks, and force all the beggar children in the city to live inside. In addition to providing food and clothing, give them moral education and give them considerable knowledge and skills to make a living.</p>
<p>2.  Funding: Assuming that there are 2,000 beggar children, excluding start-up costs, the monthly recurring cost is about 10,000 yuan. There is no shortage of kind-hearted compatriots in Shanghai, and I think this small amount is not difficult to raise.</p>
<p>Beggar children are also the future masters of the country. We provide relief to beggar children, which is also improving society and revitalizing the country. I hope that all compatriots in the city will rise up and organize to promote its realization.</p>
<p>Folk Tales</p>
<h3>Master Wang the Fourth</h3>
<p>— Fengwu</p>
<p>It is said that at the end of the Ming Dynasty, roving bandits were a scourge. Li Zicheng's forces captured Beijing, and Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on Coal Hill. Wu Sangui, the general guarding the Shanhaiguan Pass, was so enraged by Li Zicheng's seizure of his beloved concubine Chen Yuanyuan that he disregarded the consequences and allowed the Manchus to enter the pass. As a result, he let the wolf into the house, and the beautiful land was occupied by a foreign race. Dorgon entered the pass and within forty days welcomed Shunzhi to take the throne in Beijing, while simultaneously dispatching troops south. At that time, officials, both high and low, either fled or surrendered. A group of shameless Han traitors even addressed the invaders as emperors and recognized the enemy as their fathers. However, there were also many who remained unyielding. The most prominent were Shi Kefa, who vowed to perish with Yangzhou, and Yan, the registrar of Jiangyin, who steadfastly defended the isolated city. Their heroic deeds are worthy of being passed down through the ages.</p>
<p>After the Qing troops successively captured Yangzhou and Jiangyin, they marched mightily towards Zhejiang, advancing like a hot knife through butter and easily conquering Pinghu County. They then appointed a petty clown to take the stage and play the role of Pinghu County Magistrate. On the day the magistrate took office, he made a grand display of his authority as he paraded through the streets. However, the people's spirit was not dead, and everyone gnashed their teeth at the sight of his grotesque appearance, wishing they could swallow him whole. At this time, a blacksmith named Li, who was working at his forge, was so angered by the sight of this fox exploiting the tiger's authority that his eyes bulged, and he instinctively picked up a large pair of scissors and hurled them with all his might at the magistrate. Because Li the blacksmith worked with metal, his eyesight was usually accurate, and this throw was also done with all of his lifelong strength, hitting the magistrate squarely in the head. Brains flowed out, and he died on the spot. The yamen runners who were clearing the way scattered in all directions upon seeing their master dead. After the news spread, the death of a petty Han traitor was not a big deal in itself, but when it reached the ears of a Qing general, it was a disaster! He had appointed the official, and not only had the local people failed to welcome him diligently, but they had even killed him. This was intolerable! The people of Pinghu also knew that they had committed a great crime, and on the one hand, they quickly elected several gentlemen to gather a group of young men to strengthen the defenses and prepare to resist. On the other hand, they dispatched scouts to report on the movements of the Qing troops at all times. However, everyone had already heard of the massacres of "Ten Days of Yangzhou" and "Three Massacres of Jiading," and they felt as if a great disaster was about to befall them, constantly worrying about the danger of a city-wide massacre, hiding in their homes and afraid to go out.</p>
<p>However, the reality was somewhat unbelievable. Several days passed, but there was no movement from the Qing troops. The people of Pinghu assumed that nothing would happen, withdrew the scouts, and gradually relaxed the city defenses, leaving only a small group of local braves at the West Gate. The streets also returned to their original bustle, and the fear of a massacre gradually faded. But were the Qing troops really willing to let it go? When they were conquering the Han people and ruling China, any resistance to them was naturally considered a challenge to their authority, and they wanted to severely punish the people of Pinghu. This punishment was none other than indiscriminate slaughter. Therefore, while the main force of the Qing troops continued to move south, a small detachment was dispatched back to Pinghu. At first, the Qing troops saw that the city was prepared, so they remained inactive, waiting until the defenses of Pinghu were relaxed. Then, on a morning when the stars were sparse and the east was just beginning to lighten, they secretly ambushed outside the East Gate, waiting for the city gate to open so they could rush in and have a good slaughter. The poor people of Pinghu were still dreaming, unaware of the cruel massacre that would occur when the red sun rose in the east. At this time, near the city gate, in a small noodle shop, a man named Wang Si, known as Master Wang the Fourth, heard a vague and noisy sound of people outside the city and knew that something was wrong. Wang Si, despite earning his living by selling noodles, was unusually tall and strong. His arms were as thick as bronze pillars, and he possessed great strength. He was also very kind and insightful. Ever since Li the blacksmith killed the magistrate, he had known that the Qing troops would come one day. On this day, he had just gotten up when he heard the commotion outside the city. He had already guessed what was happening and thought to himself that, with his strength, he could at least hold out for a few hours and prevent the Qing troops from entering. Having made up his mind, he grabbed a large dough-cutting knife, weighing fifty or sixty pounds, from the shop, bared his chest, gritted his teeth, and hid behind the city gate, waiting for the Qing troops to rush in so that he could give them a taste of his power. His tall figure looked like a fierce gate guardian.</p>
<p>The chickens in the distance began to crow, and the sky slowly brightened. The vendors rushing to the early market gathered in greater numbers, and the people buying vegetables jostled in the crowd. The shops opened their doors one after another, and the atmosphere was as lively as usual.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Wang Si opened one side of the city gate and raised his large knife high. The Qing troops saw that the city gate was open and rushed in. Suddenly, with a loud crash, the ruthless blade flashed, and a bloody head rolled to the ground. The Qing soldier in the lead became the first victim of Wang Si's knife. Those who followed naturally met the same fate, and corpses lay scattered across the ground. Fresh red blood flowed like a spring towards the lower ground. Wang Si became more and more excited as he killed, and he became stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>At this time, the whole city knew that the Qing troops had arrived at the East Gate and that Wang Si was resisting them alone. Some took their elders and children out of the West and North Gates and fled to the nearby countryside. Some closed their doors and hid in their homes. Even the local braves who had been gathered had run away. The lively streets were now desolate, and the city had become a dead city. Only outside the East Gate, the shouts of the Qing troops were deafening. Wang Si still guarded the gate, his body covered in blood, holding out against the Qing troops for a full two hours. He truly embodied the saying, "One man guards the pass, and ten thousand cannot enter."</p>
<p>But a person's strength is ultimately limited. Eventually, he became exhausted and was overwhelmed by the Qing troops. Wang Si was turned into mincemeat under the long spears and knives of the Qing soldiers. However, the people of Pinghu were able to escape because Wang Si had intercepted the Qing troops at the city gate. This was truly a gift from Wang Si.</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, due to the oppressive power of the foreign race, people did not dare to record this event. This story was only passed down through the mouths of the elderly. The ruins of Wang Si still remain at the East Gate of Pinghu, and many people go there to worship him every year. Several years ago, the local gentry of Pinghu wanted to build a temple to commemorate him, but they did not succeed because the war of resistance had begun. However, the great deeds of Wang Si will be forever remembered.</p>
<h3>Lao Laizi</h3>
<p>— Fengjiang</p>
<p>Lao Laizi was a native of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period. He was a filial son, and his filial piety towards his parents could be said to be meticulous. When he was seventy years old, his parents were still alive, and in order to make them happy, he forgot that he was an old man and dressed like a child in colorful clothes, holding a baby's rattle and rolling on the ground to play children's games to make his parents happy. This touching story of filial piety has been passed down to this day and is still praised by people.</p>
<p>Lao Laizi was indeed a virtuous man, but his wife was even more insightful and virtuous. This virtuous woman is considered an exemplary virtuous wife, so her name is also listed in the Biographies of Virtuous Women. She once advised her husband not to change his ambitions. Lao Laizi was originally a farmer, and he farmed on the south side of Mount Meng. Once, the King of Chu passed through this place and knew that Lao Laizi was a virtuous man, so he went to find him. The King of Chu said to Lao Laizi, "You are working very hard in the fields, and it is too bitter. I want you to change your ambitions and come to our court to be a high official." Lao Laizi was somewhat tempted and agreed to serve as an official for the King of Chu. After the King of Chu left, Lao Laizi's wife strongly disagreed and said to her husband, "I have heard that those who can give you wine and meat without conditions can also give you lashes without conditions. Those who can give you high office without conditions can also give you the punishment of the axe without conditions. You are willing to change your ambitions to be a high official, but I am not willing to be controlled by others and change my ambitions to go with you." Then she left without regard for him. Lao Laizi had no choice but to give up his ambition to become an official and followed his wife. His wife said to him, "Although we are poor, we can weave the feathers of birds and beasts to keep warm, and we can gather the grains left by birds and beasts to fill our stomachs. Why change our ambitions to seek glory for the sake of a small salary?" Lao Laizi then did not change his original intention, and later generations passed it down as a beautiful story. As the saying goes, "Do not change your principles because of poverty, and do not change your ambition because of meanness." Only then can you be a great man. Those who change their ambitions to seek glory must be pleased with Lao Laizi's wife.</p>
<p>If I see one less play, the refugees can avoid cold and hunger.</p>
<p>Biographies of Famous People</p>
<h3>The Hero of Dongguan "Yuan Chonghuan" (II)</h3>
<p>— Lanxin</p>
<p>When Sancunying was not defended and Zunhua also fell, the Manchu troops drove straight in and successively conquered Jizhou, Shunyi, and other counties. At this time, Chonghuan had no choice but to send troops to meet the enemy, so he stationed troops outside the city of Shahe, facing the Manchu troops from afar.</p>
<p>He predicted that the Manchu troops would launch a night attack, so he had already set up a defense in the camp. As expected, the Manchu troops came to raid the camp that night, but they did not know that he was prepared, and the Manchu troops were killed, scattered, and fled in all directions, holding their heads and scurrying away.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chonghuan anticipated that the Manchu troops had come from afar and would benefit from a quick battle but could not last. Therefore, he used the method of "protracted war" to deal with the Manchu troops. His methods were: 1. Strengthen the walls and clear the fields, so that all manpower and materials would not be used by the Manchu troops; 2. Use a small number of troops to deal with the Manchu troops, while preserving the main force for future use; 3. If there were any losses, they would be recovered, like a seesaw, so that the power of the Manchu troops could not develop. Indeed, his military strategies were quite effective.</p>
<p>However, a protracted war requires a protracted political situation to support it. In particular, internal will must be unified, otherwise the enemy will take the opportunity to exploit it, because when the enemy suffers military setbacks, they are accustomed to using insidious methods of discord to replace their dying struggle. Sure enough, the Manchus used a counter-espionage plot, forging two documents and having them dropped outside the Yongding Gate in Beijing. By chance, someone picked them up and took them to see Emperor Huai. Emperor Huai originally believed in Chonghuan, but now someone said that Chonghuan was not resisting, and the letters were full of private words of reconciliation that violated the country. When Emperor Huai saw this, he was furious and said, "That's outrageous! No wonder Chonghuan is standing still. So that's what's going on!" He immediately ordered Chonghuan to be recalled, beheaded, and displayed to the public.</p>
<p>Chonghuan was dead. His wife and brothers were exiled three thousand miles away. This was not enough, and Emperor Huai also ordered the confiscation of his property. Later, several old wooden utensils and a box of coarse cloth clothes were found in his home, and nothing else. At this point, Emperor Huai realized that Chonghuan was an honest official and that there must have been a misunderstanding about the matter of seeking peace.</p>
<p>When the truth came to light and the Manchu troops entered the Central Plains, Emperor Huai was very regretful! Alas! Chonghuan died. Since this loyal, brave, and patriotic minister was killed, the Ming Dynasty's empire was in danger. (The End)</p>
<h3>A Way Out for Our Fellow Refugees in the Future</h3>
<p>— Sun Xuexiao</p>
<p>Participate in Production Work</p>
<p>"The refugee shelter is not sheltering refugees now; it's simply sheltering a group of lazy people!" This is an angry statement from some of the people involved in refugee work and some social figures familiar with the situation in the shelters. Of course, this statement is a bit of an exaggeration, and the fellow refugees will definitely have a negative reaction when they hear it. But if we think about it carefully, it's not without reason. Indeed, for more than a year, the number of people in society seeking maids, nannies, apprentices, and odd-jobbers from the shelters has been dozens every month. However, the number of applicants is as rare as morning stars; even if they apply, they become discouraged after a few days and return to the shelters. The shelter authorities, adhering to the purpose of education, have established various small workshops in the shelters, recruiting fellow refugees to participate in production work. In the end, there is the same situation of work available but no one to do it, so that the workshop authorities cannot maintain them and have to close them. According to the investigation of ordinary people, the reason why the fellow refugees are not happy to participate in production work is that they dislike the low wages and the hard work, which is one reason, but the main reason is that they rely on the shelters for food and lodging, and they don't have to worry about freezing and starving if they don't work.</p>
<p>I think, if this statement hits the heart of the average fellow refugee, then the future of these fellow refugees will definitely encounter great danger! Why do I say this?</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the supplies for the shelters are donated by charitable people at home and abroad. But charitable people are not gods of wealth, and the supply of the shelters cannot come from a constant source. In other words, the shelters are in danger of being dissolved at any time. Therefore, if we don't find a job to do in advance, the fellow refugees will definitely face freezing and starvation as soon as the shelters are dissolved.</p>
<p>To take a step back, even if the supplies for the shelters are constantly provided by the efforts of charitable people at home and abroad until the war is over, if we don't find a job to do in advance and prepare to earn some money and exercise our bodies, even if you can return to your hometown happily, you will not be able to rebuild the families destroyed by the artillery fire because you have been wandering around empty-handed and have become lazy! No, at least in the initial stage of rebuilding your family, you will encounter considerable difficulties.</p>
<p>Moreover, our country's policy is a long-term war of resistance. The so-called long-term war of resistance is an indefinite war of resistance, lasting at least two or three years, or as long as eight or ten years, or even several decades. Can our shelters exist indefinitely? I think, as the war continues day by day, the social economy will inevitably become more and more difficult. Then the difficulty of providing supplies for the shelters will inevitably become more and more serious, until it is impossible to maintain them in the middle. At that time, we fellow refugees who have not found work and saved some money in advance will not be able to return to our hometowns or stay in our host towns. What will we do?</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, I believe that as fellow refugees, as long as they are adults, regardless of men and women, as long as they are not working for the other side, regardless of Chinese and foreigners, they should find a job to earn money and exercise their soon-to-be lazy bodies. Never dislike a job because it is too hard or the wages are too low, and never quit a job that you have already taken. In particular, you should pay attention to the fact that the money you earn is blood money, which is to be used as capital for rebuilding your family when the country is recovered and you return to your hometown. Don't waste it, and save as much as possible.</p>
<p>Perhaps, some people will ask, where can I find a job on this isolated island where there is little porridge and many monks? Who will give me work to do? I think, considering the number of production enterprises established by various shelters in the past and the planned implementation of the well-intentioned administrative authorities to strengthen production enterprises in the future, as long as you are willing to work hard, it will not be a big problem. Moreover, social figures always have sympathy. As long as they know that you are a refugee who wants to work, even if they don't give you work right away, they will give you priority when there is an opportunity! If this is also impossible, then you may wish to find some funds to run a small business. Fortunately, you have food and lodging, even if you don't earn a penny, you only spend some energy! But this shouldn't be the case, right? Otherwise, how can the small producers in the shelters maintain their personal food and lodging or even the food and lodging of their families every day?</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope to all fellow refugees:</p>
<p>The only and safe way for fellow refugees to survive this unprecedented and protracted national crisis is to participate in production work. Therefore, every fellow refugee should "have a job if they are unemployed, and enjoy their work if they are employed." At the same time, every fellow refugee should understand that "saving a penny now can help you more when you leave the shelter and return to your hometown!"</p>
<h3>Saving People and Killing People</h3>
<p>— Reporter for the Refugees</p>
<p>Yu the Great, who controlled the floods, thought that if there were people drowning in the world, it was as if he had drowned them.</p>
<p>Hou Ji, who managed the food supply, thought that if there were people starving to death in the world, it was as if he had starved them to death.</p>
<p>I think: If people who have the ability cannot contribute money and effort to save the displaced compatriots, and cause them to starve and freeze to death, then those displaced compatriots who starve and freeze to death are being killed alive by the people who have the ability. Failure to save people is killing people!</p>

<p>(Above) After the teacher saw Lopeti standing on the desk, he didn't say a word and walked over to stroke Lopeti's head. Instead, he said, "Good boy, don't do that kind of thing again next time!" (Below) After the dictation was over, the teacher looked at us calmly and said in a kind voice, "Everyone, listen to me. We will be together for a year from now on. Let's have a good year together. Everyone should work hard and be disciplined. I don't have any family members; you are my family members. Besides you, there is no one else in the world that I love. You are my sons. I love you. Please like me too. I won't punish any of you. Please show me your sincerity."</p>
<h3>Weekly War Report</h3>
<p>In the past week, the war situation in various places has shown signs of activity. Whether it is in Guangdong and Hunan-Hubei, as well as the Jinbei area, there has been considerable contact. However, the two sides in the war have not made much progress for the time being. Of course, progress needs to be strived for both subjectively and objectively. - Losing a place today and capturing a city tomorrow may seem different on the surface, but in reality, it is still a performance of time. In the new stage of total war, the form of war will inevitably change from a stalemate of stalemate to a comprehensive struggle. Understanding this principle, there is no need to be anxious about the current war situation, because this is not a short-term matter. Reforming politics, building production, and contributing all manpower and materials to the country, and integrating one's own interests with the interests of the country, this is the current key. Enough small talk, let's get back to the main topic.</p>
<p>The War in Guangdong is Like a Seesaw</p>
<p>In Guangdong, the Dongjiang, Shilong, and Zengcheng areas have been captured by the Chinese army several times. However, in order to consolidate Guangzhou, the Japanese side has to fight desperately for Zengcheng and other places. Therefore, Zengcheng and other places have been captured by the Chinese army several times and then captured by the Japanese army several times, just like a seesaw, always fighting back and forth.</p>
<p>According to a Hong Kong dispatch on the 17th, "In the area between Shitan and Dongguan in the East River, the Chinese and Japanese armies fought fiercely in the Dongguan area. Yesterday, a part of the Japanese army in the North River attacked Xin Street on the Yuehan Road, and another part attacked Huaxian in the north. Both of the above places are now in fierce fighting. As for the West River, the line from Lubao Jiang'an to Gulao is also under stalemate."</p>
<p>However, recently, the Japanese army has suffered setbacks in the South China war and has made great attempts to open up the situation. It is said that Japanese warships along the coast of Zhongshan have been frequently increased. The number of large and small ships has increased to more than 100, carrying a lot of military supplies. It is reported that the Zhongshan authorities have destroyed the relevant routes and are on strict alert.</p>
<p>The War in Northern Hunan is Like Kicking a Ball</p>
<p>The war in the Northern Hunan area has been intermittent, just like a ball, kicking back and forth. According to a dispatch from Miluo: "Recently, the Chinese army has ventured out in the wind and snow and extreme cold, moving vertically and horizontally in the Yuezhou Linxiang area. Although the Japanese army has tried its best to repair the road line between Wu and Yue, it cannot guarantee that it will not be cut off by the Chinese army. At present, in addition to building fortifications on both sides of the Pu Yue Railway, the Japanese army in Taolin, Yuezhou, has concentrated its forces and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army to the east of Yuezhou. On the one hand, it has also driven its Japanese army at the Wujiang Bridge to the south, attacking the Chinese side's Shuanglongwan, in order to contain the Chinese field army from supporting the north. They are now in fierce fighting."</p>
<p>The War in Western Shanxi is Winning Victories</p>
<p>The war in Western Shanxi is still in full swing. Although the Japanese army is launching a full-scale attack on Western Shanxi, its purpose is nothing more than to eliminate the main force of the Chinese army and then cross the river to attack Shaanxi Province. However, the Chinese side has long been prepared for this attempt. As a result of the fierce fighting last week, the Chinese side once abandoned Jixian, Daning, Puxian, and Xiangning due to strategic reasons. Recently, the Chinese army has been reinforced and has begun a major counter-offensive. After three days and nights of hard fighting, it finally recovered all the lost lands one after another. According to a telegram from Xi'an:</p>
<p>"After the Chinese army in Western Shanxi captured Daning Wucheng, it advanced rapidly to the north. The Chinese armies in Puxian and Heilongguan have joined forces, approaching Tumen and attacking Linfen. At the same time, a large part of the Chinese army is besieging Shilou."</p>

<h3>Eye-Obscuring Trick</h3>
<p>— Lu Jin</p>
<p>It is said that itinerant tricksters all have a kind of "magic" that allows them to deceive people without their knowing it. This "magic" is called "eye-obscuring trick." It means that as long as your eyes are momentarily obscured by them, your money or valuables will disappear in the blink of an eye. Magicians have a saying, "In the blink of an eye, an old hen turns into a duck," which is similar.</p>
<p>The "dog-skin plaster" sellers on the streets also use this "eye-obscuring trick" to swindle money from country folk, but they are a bit more like "forced sales," which makes timid people shy away. The clever tricksters tell you that a one-dollar bill can be turned into a hundred dollars. If you don't believe it, you can try it on the spot. So, the servants in mansions and the clerks in shops think that "there is a way to make money," and they steal or pilfer to gather a sum of money. They sincerely kowtow to some patriarch, but with that one kowtow, the banknotes turn into waste paper, and the trickster has flown away, either picking up a hostess in a hotel or indulging in strong liquor in a restaurant.</p>
<p>Now, this "magic" has become "widely used," and even nations that demand others to "kneel" do not hesitate to "lower themselves" to using the "eye-obscuring trick."</p>
<p>For example, they first release the news that they have invested millions in Chinese film companies, claiming it is the beginning of "cultural cooperation." But the Chinese film companies remain unmoved, and the eyes of the Chinese people are also watching very clearly. Then they say that "so-called cultural figures and many writers have been sent to Shanghai to actively engage in activities together with film industry representatives," and they cite the "companies" they have bought out as examples to "lobby" various parties. But what is the result? "The film industry in this city has adhered to a scorched earth policy since the war, fighting against the environment. No amount of enticement or coercion will move them. Their righteousness is awe-inspiring, and their attitude is firm!" And those "companies" that do not cherish themselves have long been spurned by the Chinese people!</p>
<p>The "eye-obscuring trick" can only be used on wavering people. For example, if you don't want to get rich, the trick has no way to work. If you are awe-inspiring in your righteousness, there is naturally no way to act. "One hand cannot cover the eyes and ears of all the people." Now they are only obscuring the "eyes," so their failure is almost certain!</p>
<p>Moreover, when it comes to real swords and guns, let's have a "hundred-year war."</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Song Zhide, the author of "Wu Zetian," changed his pen name to "Song Yizhou" because of He Mengfu's relationship and was working as a screenwriter at the Northwest Film Company. As he spent more and more time with Ms. Wang, they fell in love with each other. So, the two of them frankly began a sweet cohabitation of sexual love.</p>
<p>In the summer of the 25th year of the Republic, they came to Shanghai again and lived in the small building of a grocery store on Rue Lupan.</p>
<p>Wang Ping and Lao Song, the two of them, not only shared the same aspirations and personalities, but even their hobbies were the same. Both of them were very generous, casual, liked to smoke cigarettes, and loved to drink Shaoxing wine. Look, it's really a pair of lovers that are hard to find even if you wear out your iron shoes, a veritable "match made in heaven"!</p>
<p>This is not a joke, it's all true: Wang Ping's single cheongsam in the summer, it is said that she does not change it. Today it's this one, tomorrow it's this one, and the day after tomorrow it's still this one. Is it dirty? Who cares, anyway, she wears it on her own body, it's none of anyone else's business. When it's really too dirty to wear anymore, she takes it off and throws it under the bed, and that's the end of it. Old Song? It's the same. If you go to his house to play, all you see is his smelly socks all over the house, one on the bed, two on the floor, and one on the writing desk. But, both of them "turn a blind eye," and no one cares.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they are also the most revolutionary couple of artists on the stage. In order to awaken all the Chinese people, they traveled all over the country. For one year and five months, they endured all kinds of hardships, always gritting their teeth and tenaciously working on the drama movement to save the nation.</p>
<p>Now, they are in Chongqing. I hope that the seeds of national salvation drama that they sowed there will bloom into beautiful flowers in the near future.</p>
<p>Salute, a pair of artists who are working hard to save the nation through drama!</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Stage</h3>
<p>— Qu Shigong</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Ping, who wears light makeup and loves to braid her hair into two small braids, those who have seen the Shanghai Amateur Drama Troupe's performance of "Wu Zetian" will not soon forget the vivid image she created of the old nun in the play.</p>
<p>Wang Ping, she is from Nanjing, and her real name should be written as "Guangzhen."</p>
<p>Yes, Wang Ping is Wang Guangzhen. If you are not forgetful, you should also remember an event that caused a sensation in the theatrical circles of Nanjing and Shanghai, no, the whole country, in the spring of the 24th year of the Republic—a female teacher at Xingzhongmen Elementary School in Nanjing was dismissed by the school authorities for participating in the performance of Ibsen's famous play "A Doll's House" by the Mofeng Drama Society? The female teacher in question is none other than Ms. Wang Ping, whom I am introducing today.</p>
<p>After Wang Guangzhen was kicked out of Xingzhongmen Elementary School in the capital, she went to the Northwest Film Company in Taiyuan, Shanxi, through the introduction of friends, and became a movie actor under the mercury lamps. The name "Wang Ping" was also changed at this time.</p>
<h3>Humor of the Suzhou River</h3>
<p>— Tong Guangzuo</p>
<h3>Fishing Light of Beihai</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>"Sea of the North"</p>
<p>A Paramount Pictures Production Showing at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>"Fishing Light of the North" is a story about two tough guys who are as close as brothers. Taylor and Jim are both fishermen. Taylor is later lured by the pirate Ridley to join forces and steal the fishermen's fish traps. Jim wounds him. "Ridley sees that the situation is not good, abandons Taylor, and leads the crowd to escape. Jim orders Taylor to return to shore for treatment."</p>
<p>After being defeated by the fishermen, Ridley hates Jim to the bone and thinks of revenge. "Taylor knows that he has evil intentions and begs to go with him." On the way, he takes the opportunity to lock Ridley in the cabin, and he himself steers the ship toward an iceberg. Both the ship and the man are destroyed and buried in the blue sea.</p>
<p>This story is tragic, and the friendship between Taylor and Jim is even more touching. Through the screen, the simple scenery of the fishing village and the strong and straightforward character of the bloody men are truly endearing. They are playful, jumping and闹闹, not knowing what is called worry, and such a simple temperament is due to their strong bodies, which not only makes people feel cute, but also makes people envious. What is even more touching is the fishermen's resistance to pirates, using the power of life to protect the East Four obtained by the power of life, so that it is not damaged; in that tense weaving, people are reminded of our damaged fishery and fishermen, as well as the brothers who are fighting for the survival of the motherland. Jim's close-up of his dismayed brain after shooting Taylor with a gun is touching, and what is the audience's reaction in their hearts? "A good doctor has no private relationships." No matter from which point of view, it is not wrong to blame him for being so cautious.</p>
<p>"Fishing Light of the North" focuses on the friendship between Taylor and Jim, so it reduces the suffering of the fishermen and the power of the masses, which is the greatest loss. Otherwise, this play would have had greater value.</p>
<p>As it is now, it certainly makes us feel the preciousness of friendship, and also touches the vitality of those bloody men, because in this way it makes the young masters of the foreign concession who only know how to talk about love seem incapable and hateful, but if this torrent of life is returned to the sea, surging and rushing in the tide, what an exciting scene would that be?</p>
<p>Director Henry Hathaway has valuable experience in such plays, thick and exciting, and has his own spirit. In particular, each role, under his treatment, appears so rich in vitality and so different, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>George Raft's Taylor is not bad, although strictly speaking, he still has a bit of the ruffian flavor of the city, and is not purely a simple fisherman; Henry Fonda is a little timid, and the play is well-acted, but the appearance always feels less solid; what is admirable is Dorothy Lamour, her city's seductive breath has been washed away, and her healthy physique helps her become a lively and lively character, Akim Tamiroff's Ridley is very commensurate with his appearance, and the play is also very stable; John Barrymore plays the chief writer of a local newspaper here, the play is not important, the old artists ah!</p>
<h3>Sketches of the Slums</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>At the corner of Singapore Road, what unfolds before people's eyes is a tragic picture of refugees.</p>
<p>In the rugged pile of rocks, only a few wooden boards are used to cover some straw, and this becomes their home.</p>
<p>In this simple house, they eat, sleep, and even defecate here.</p>
<p>On a broken door, Xiao Sanzi has filled it with many drawings, and the red paper strip of "Jiang Taigong is here" has been blown off halfway by the north wind.</p>
<p>Because there is no drain, the sewage naturally gathers together, accumulating more and more, and gradually becomes a pond. Although it is the cold winter season, there is still a damp and stinky smell that comes into the nose.</p>
<p>If it rains for several days in a row, it is even worse. Not only are the roads muddy and impassable, but also the house will drip with drizzle.</p>
<p>The people living in this house, whether men, women, old or young, cannot be like the refugees in the shelter, folding their hands and only knowing how to eat. Every day, for the sake of three meals that are not enough to eat, they have to shed their blood and sweat to maintain their lives.</p>
<p>Most of the men go to pull rickshaws, work as dock coolies, peddlers... It is considered lucky for women to be able to go to work in factories, otherwise they will squat on the ground and knock on stones, and even children have to carry bamboo baskets to pick up waste.</p>
<p>It is pitiful enough that they are struggling on the edge of hunger, working hard, but there are often unexpected misfortunes, such as the landlord's order to move, and the layers of extortion by the intermediaries, all of which make them have no power to resist. Apart from weeping and swallowing their anger and trying to make the best of it, it can be said that there is no other way!</p>
<p>I hope that enthusiastic social figures will no longer ignore this small group and give them strong support.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Director Jin Eloquently Discusses the Concept of Equality</p>
<p>Moreover, although the two of them are classmates in technology, they each have their own hobbies outside of technology. He Shuangyu likes music, while He Peiyu likes painting. This can be considered as each tending to one end, but both of them are equally clever. Miss Jin said with a smile at that time, "Yu Gang, when we were talking about standardization, I thought, now all kinds of crafts have to be standardized, how can people also be standardized? It's not that people are also standardized, how can you two sisters be the same?" He Peiyu said, "Don't talk nonsense!" Jin Danyu said, "It's because it's nonsense that I didn't say it just now. Otherwise, Jiancheng can say anything." Just as she was talking about Jiancheng, she saw Jiancheng coming from afar. She asked them if they had bought the flowers yet? She said, "I've bought them." Miss Jin paid a dollar for them, and Mama Huang said, "There's still some left over." Miss Jin said, "Forget it! Forget it!" Lin Jiancheng accompanied them and entered the White Stone Archway. The size and grandeur of that martyr's tomb are no less than Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum in Nanjing. Only, Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum is built on a mountain, while this one is built on a plain. From the White Stone Archway, there is a passage, and the pine and cypress trees on both sides have grown into lush forests. The passage leads directly to a hall, which is where the public comes to worship and commemorate on the spring and autumn equinoxes and memorial days. Outside the hall, there is a very wide white stone platform, and there are also some stone carvings of art, all of which were donated by various countries at that time. In addition, there are large pots of flowers and trees, planted with evergreen trees and unfading flowers, and they are cleaned up in a particularly clean way. Turning from the cloister next to the hall to the back, you reach the martyr's tomb, a large square area with a bun-shaped top, like the tops of churches. In front of it, there is a large marble tombstone with golden inscriptions. Around it, there are many vases filled with flower branches, all of which are filled with flower branches. Some of the flower branches have already withered, and some of the flower branches are still fresh, which shows that there is always someone who comes here every day to admire the martyr's tomb and offer flowers. The two Miss He also inserted each of the bouquets they were holding into the vases. Coincidentally, there were two empty vases side by side, and Miss Jin helped them to insert the bouquets in, which was just right. It turned out that the flower shop here knew the size of the bouquets, and then they paid their respects to the past martyrs and the pioneers who died for the country, and remained silent for a minute or two. After a little while, it was already lunchtime. Miss Jin said, "Then let's go and have lunch! After lunch, let's go and see a few more places here. What do you think?" (20)</p>

<h3>Anna May Wong Changes Her Style</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>Among the movie stars of Hollywood, descendants of the Yellow Emperor are rare—there are only two, and coincidentally both of them are surnamed "Huang": the first is the photographer Huang Zongzhan, who is often seen for his art but not seen in person; the second is Anna May Wong, who often plays Chinese people in foreign films.</p>
<p>Her father is an overseas Chinese who has lived in the United States for a long time. She was born in Los Angeles, USA, and before she returned to her motherland, she had never left Los Angeles even a step. Because Los Angeles is very close to Hollywood, the capital of the film industry, she was influenced by what she saw and heard, and she became interested in movies from a young age—she almost always watched movies after school every day; at the same time, because she admired the life of movie stars, she developed the desire to become a movie star when she grew up.</p>
<p>When she was a child at home, her name was "Huang Liushuang", but when she entered the American school, it was changed to "Naimaie Huang". At the age of twelve, she acted as an extra in "The Red Lantern" (Red Lantern) starring Mrs. Yue (the late Qi Mu star) and achieved considerable success. Since then, she has served as an extra in "The Moon Palace Treasure Box" starring Helen Peters. Since then, she has not only been welcomed for her film technology but also praised on the stage in New York, especially in the famous play On the spot by the great writer Edgar Wallace, she is even more admired by the beautiful women. In the past, her style was somewhat unsatisfactory—she mostly performed in films that insulted China; but since she first returned to her motherland for travel several years ago, her style has changed. As usual, she also performs on the radio under the management of the British Broadcasting Corporation, boasting for her motherland and appealing for the war of resistance of her motherland.</p>
<p>"Filial Daughter Punishes the Wicked", " Corpse's Rebuke", and "Horoscope Washes Injustices When are you Born, which have been showing in major theaters in the isolated island this year, are works after she changed her style.</p>
<h3>Talk About Southern Opera</h3>
<p>— (Bihua)</p>
<p>Southern opera, because it is prefixed with the word "Southern", is indeed popular in the South. It was also popular in Shanghai for a while. Most of the actors are from Wu, the lyrics are derived from Kunqu opera, and most of the audience is from Suzhou. Women especially flocked to it. The reason is that the lyrics are popular and thought-provoking, but they are all performed in amusement parks. Although they once formed an independent troupe, because the dramas they arranged were all old-fashioned and monotonous, without creativity, it was difficult to gain a foothold, and they failed one after another. Recently, they have been running on the radio, living a broadcast life, and are quite popular with the audience. I think that if Southern opera can be reformed again and new plays can be arranged, it is not difficult to occupy a place in the drama world. It is a pity that they stick to the old ways and do not seek progress, and they are lagging behind like Weibang opera and Bengbeng opera. Thinking of this, how can I not be filled with emotion! I hope that those who lead Southern opera will strive to make progress and not let Shaoxing opera and Shenqu opera be beautiful in front of them.</p>
<h3>A Note on "The Moon Rises" and Other One-Act Plays</h3>
<p>— Jiangshang</p>
<p>Yilin Drama Society - Second Performance</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second performance of the Yilin Drama Society's Sunday Theater. I know very little about the past of this society, but the impression given to me by these two performances has made me very interested. This performance includes: "Matchmaking", "The Moon Rises", "The Man Who Rides a Horse into the Sea", three one-act plays. I will write some of what I have seen below, and I think it will be welcome to the comrades who love drama.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of scripts, some people blame the Yilin Society for not being in line with the times. However, in this environment, with heavy pressure, even if there are very good and very suitable scripts for the times, they cannot be rehearsed. Therefore, both performances are of the social problem type. The three one-act play scripts used this time, except for "Matchmaking" which was written by Chen Baichen, the other two are imported goods.</p>
<p>The first play to open was "Matchmaking". The plot is that the poet married three wives, but none of them could grow old together. So he posted a matchmaking advertisement, preparing to play with all the women in a big way to avenge himself. But all those who came to apply were poor worms, which made him very disappointed. Finally, his second wife came again. She finally saw through his tricks and made an excuse to leave. The poet ended up failing. Lingzi played the poet, and in terms of identity, it was much more suitable than the son he played in the last time's "Liu Sanye". His only strength is his clear pronunciation. In terms of action, there are many unconscious excesses. But it doesn't feel like there are any drawbacks.</p>
<p>The second play is "The Moon Rises". The plot is that a sheriff wants to get a reward and visits an escaped prisoner in the middle of the night. He meets a street singer, but unexpectedly the street singer is the prisoner, and also the sheriff's old friend from before. The sheriff, motivated by loyalty and righteousness, finally let him escape. The original play is very thought-provoking and has a satirical power. Wang Zhuyou, who plays the sheriff, and Yang Youwei, who plays the street singer, have a lot of experience in acting. The sheriff's movements are quite beautiful, and it is very rare that the street singer acts completely differently before and after being discovered as a prisoner.</p>
<p>The last one is "The Man Who Rides a Horse into the Sea". The plot is very simple. An Irish old woman loses a son who loves to sail and adventure. Only two daughters are left to comfort her. The meaning of the play is implicit and too hidden, and most of the audience finds it difficult to understand. In this play, Tang Qi, who plays the eldest daughter, and Ju Nian, who plays the second daughter, Nora, have clear and sweet tones and are very natural and effortless. In addition, Bai Di, who plays the mother, can still be competent.</p>
<p>I think that what is more important in acting in spoken drama and other dramas is that the talents of all the characters in the play, whether they are leading roles or supporting roles, must be commensurate. The incompetence of one supporting role will make the whole play inferior. Drama is an important tool for public education. I hope that the Yilin Society can work hard and strive forward without fear of hardship!</p>
<h3>News from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lingjie United Association performed voluntary operas for Pushan Villa on the 19th and 20th, and sold a total of 3,331.96 yuan, which has been sent to Pushan in full, and the villa issued a receipt and thanked them in a letter.</p>
<p>The Yifeng Drama Society of the Carlton Theater will perform the same cast and the same story next spring, and will add old male actor Zhang Yueting and female actor Qian Shuming. All preparations have been completed, and there are still two female actors in negotiations.</p>
<p>The rehearsal of the five-part opera "Zhang Guolao Gets Married" at the Tianchan Stage has begun after the end of last night's show. It is scheduled to be performed on Friday (27th). There is news that the literary and martial old male actor Li Ruchun has joined.</p>
<p>Playwright Yin Sheng and wealthy merchant Xiao Eshi have returned to Shanghai from Siam. For this trip, Yin will organize the China Art Group and invite roles, and Xiao plans to organize the China Overseas Chinese Autumn Movie Company in Annam.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen News</h3>
<p>— Xinshi</p>
<p>Photographer Yan Hewu used 16mm small film last year to shoot a Shanghai opera film of Xiaowenbin he made himself—the play "Virtuous Daughter-in-Law" achieved considerable success. For this reason, he decided to organize a company dedicated to shooting plays with small films, because its playback effect is the same as ordinary films, and the cost is much lower, which is indeed a good way to be clever. Recently, he is busy looking for a suitable base to prepare to build a studio. The first film script has been prepared, named "Butterfly Girl"—it is a story mixed with Miao people. Li Pingqian has been hired as the director, and Gu Lanjun and Sun Min will star. At the same time, it is also planned to use airplanes to send them to the United States for washing, and to shoot them as local color films. Once this plan is realized, it will set a new record for domestic films.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang" Tang Jie has entered Sichuan twice and has gone through many hardships. In the autumn of last year, he returned to Shanghai early and was hired by Xinhua. His old partner "Xiao Chen" Cao Xuesong is still staying in Sichuan, engaged in the war of resistance. The two of them are now separated by thousands of miles, each going his own way; just like Laurel and Hardy, they have broken up. Recently, Tang Jie has written a new script for "Mr. Wang Has Trouble Eating", which is a humorous work that depicts the coldness of the world and the pain of unemployment, which will make people shed tears from laughter. In the play, the role of "Xiao Chen" does not appear, only a letter of introduction sent from Sichuan to "Mr. Wang" to recommend business; this is specifically to hide it because Cao Xuesong is not in Shanghai, which is quite ingenious.</p>
<p>Tan Ying's right side of the nose recently suffered from a boil; at first, it was very fierce and painful; medical treatment was ineffective, so she was very anxious. After being introduced by a friend, she changed to Dr. Tao Basheng for treatment, and it turned out to be very successful: now her pink cheeks have long been free of swelling and the boil has disappeared, leaving only a small scar. Dr. Tao also said: "It can be guaranteed to restore the original state, and it will definitely not damage the beauty like a slight blemish." They are very important in filming movies on this aspect, and Tan Ying was very happy with this result, and almost took a reassurance pill!</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Renowned Dan Performer Feng Zihe</h3>
<p>— Jinglu</p>
<p>Chun Hang has recently returned to perform at the Golden Theater. This elder performer had long ago washed off the theatrical makeup and vanished from the stage. But due to the earnest invitation from Zhou Xinfang during the French celebrations, he couldn't refuse the deep affection and agreed to make a guest appearance for two days, revealing his former brilliance once more. His grand and authentic voice and exemplary style remain intact, truly a treasure of the operatic world. I know that this performance will surely captivate many Zhou enthusiasts. Many anecdotes from his life are recorded here, offered for those who love Feng.</p>
<p>Feng Lang's fame preceded that of Wan Hua. At the time, only Jia Biyun could rival him. But operatic circles each supported their favorites, leading to the terms "Feng faction" and "Jia faction." His fellow townsman, Sun Juxian, greatly valued Zihe, as they both belonged to the Dan Gui troupe. Sun rarely agreed to co-star in the play "San Niang Teaches Her Son" with anyone, because Xue Bao had to kneel before San Niang. The only exception was Chun Hang. Whenever there were banquets, even if there was no "little Feng," he would always be brought along. His support was unwavering, to this extent.</p>
<p>Feng became famous in his time for performing the play "Feng Xiaoqing." In the fourth year of the Republic [1915], he once traveled to West Lake in Hangzhou with Liu Yazi, Lu Ebu, and other scholars. They lingered for a long time before Xiaoqing's tomb on Gushan, paying their respects. Yazi specially erected a monument beside the tomb to commemorate the event, leaving it as a captivating tale on the lake, forever associated with this peerless beauty.</p>
<p>People often say that Wan Hua invented ancient costumes, but in fact, Zihe was far ahead of him. For example, the trailing robes worn in the play "Seventh of July" were one such creation. They were magnificent and beautiful, and female performers at the time all competed to imitate them. In addition, he also pioneered new opera vernacular, eliminated front-line codas, and added the erhu to the orchestra. When performing the play "Drunken Concubine," his elder brother, Feng Sanguo, played the jinghu, Wu Guifen played the erhu, and he sang the so-na and erhuang with his small voice. Plays such as "Da Xiangshan," "The Wife's Party Shares the Evil Reward," and "Selling Flowers San Niangzi" were all examples. His contributions to the art of opera were truly significant.</p>
<p>This elder performer had a thorough understanding of both Western and Chinese cultures. In his later years, he became fond of Buddhism and enjoyed discussing Zen with others. Recently, he wrote in my commemorative album, "All beings are originally Buddhas, and Buddhas are also beings. The dust of eons has neither beginning nor end, and the wonderful lotus flower is neither ancient nor new." His brushstrokes were bold and sharp. He was truly one of the first among performers to advocate for elegance and refinement.</p>

<h3>A Brief Talk on Jin Suwen</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Isn't it strange? The first time I saw Suwen, she looked so familiar, as if I had seen her somewhere before. I couldn't figure it out. Perhaps she just has a naturally likeable face. We don't need to use flowery descriptions to describe a woman's beauty. If you want to see Suwen's face, there's a photo here to prove it. She is very worldly and understands human nature. When she speaks, she has a youthful innocence, a bit hesitant, not yet fully grown up, and gets anxious easily – all characteristic of a woman.</p>
<p>I haven't been to the opera much lately, so I haven't seen Suwen on stage yet. The other night, I saw "Wen Sucheng." That play goes without saying, it's very good. She played Xuan Gu in it, and she truly portrayed her vividly. We don't need to compare her with Yu Ziyun or Shi Xiaofu here! Theater follows the times, and this kind of play follows the trends, so actors must do the same, which is really not easy.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Opera World of the Old Capital (83)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>We Shanghai people (actually, I am not a Shanghai native, but I have lived in Shanghai for twenty years, so I can use the word "we"). We are indeed too foolish and stupid. Every year, Beijing opera performers take at least two hundred thousand in cash back to the old capital to buy houses and land. Moreover, theater owners have to send people to pick them up and drop them off, as if they were revering celestial beings. These famous performers put on quite an act. Although they say they are not very willing to come to the South, in reality, every one of them cranes their necks waiting for someone from Shanghai to come and fetch them. It's truly a case of "eating fish and disliking the smell, raising a lover and pretending to be pure." (i.e., claiming to be innocent). When it comes down to it, they all think coming to Shanghai is a great opportunity to make a fortune, but they just deliberately put on airs. Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Li Shengzao, and others are now all leading roles who bring their own troupes. Every time they decide to come to Shanghai, they demand about ten to twenty thousand in large denominations. However, when they were still apprentices, they all wore long blue coarse cloth gowns, had shaven heads, and ate simple, rough food. If someone was performing a major role on a particular day, the troupe leader would specially give them eight large copper coins (i.e., sixteen copper plates) to drink bean juice and eat fried dough sticks (i.e., youtiao). Usually, they would get only four or six large plates, and some wouldn't even get one. Yet they still had to perform well. If they didn't, they might even get beaten. But every ticket sold (nowadays, the ticket price for Fu Liancheng also sells for at least one hundred and fifty or sixty yuan, and if there are performances both day and night, they can earn more than three hundred yuan.)</p>
