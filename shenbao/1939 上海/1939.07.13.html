<h3 id="c2">加强對外貿易的統制 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>今年前五個月的中國對外貿易，據最近海關報告，進口値五萬六千八百萬元，出口値二萬四千三百萬元，比較去年同期進出口數字都有增加，貿易差額爲入超二萬二千五百萬元，較去年同期增加一萬零二百萬元，的倍於去年的全年入超數額。過去中國歷年的入超，已使中國經濟上蒙受不良的影響；在目前抗戰期內，全國經濟能力應該集中從事於各種經濟建設和購買軍火；乃事實所示，還要在國外貿易上負擔一筆巨大的支出，這不能不認爲是一種糜費。</p>
<p>一個國家當對外作戰的時候，對於國外貿易總是加以極嚴格的統制。中國自抗戰之後，對國外貿易雖然也加統制，但並不怎樣嚴密，以致不能發生最大的效果，貿易統制的所以不嚴格，並非事實上的不可能，乃爲保全歐美各國在華的權益，不願使她們的在華商務，太受影響，因此之故，淪陷區域得在中國政府法令權力管束之外，自由經營；對外貿易被禁止的商品還能繼續輸入內地；有些非必需品的進口，也不能加以禁絕。結果所至，中國的對外貿易；就地域言，淪陷區域的數額爲最多；就國別言，日本一躍而居中國對外貿易上的首席。這種種情形，不僅對於戰時經濟諸多不利而已。</p>
<p>最近中國政府爲調整對外貿易起見，同時頒佈了禁止進口貨物辦法，出口貨物結匯領取匯價差額辦法，和申請外匯規則等三項法令。第一項法令在禁止全部奢侈品和一部非必需品的進口；第二項法令係鼓勳土貨的輸出；第三項法令則爲申請外匯手續的規定；凡是淪陷區域的進口貿易，却不能依法申請。這三項法令，都是針對着目前不良狀態而發的；預料實行之後，可以獲得極大的效果。至於中國政府從前所顧慮的歐美在華權利，現在爲事實所限，備受壓迫，已非中國方面的綱開一面所能濟事，故已不成爲問題。</p>
<p>中國的戰時貿易統制，自上述三項法令頒佈後，法律上可謂已經相當強化；不過法令之外，必須管以嚴密的組織，輔以確定的政策，才能發生大效。在世界第一决大戰期內，實行統制貿易最有效的是英國，而統制貿易的組織最嚴密的也是英國。她在戰時商務部之下，分設各種商品委員會，管理各種商品的進出；並設立戰時商務調查部和戰時商務統計部，專門調查中立國的商務情形。她的貿易政策，對於各種重要的商品，大都採取協定貿易的方式，以防止資敵。就近兩年來中國對外貿易情形來說，有許多被禁止的商品，仍在內地各處市塲銷售；中國也有不少的原料，却仍不合理的輸出。可見統制組織還未臻完善。中國的貿易政策，最近已採取以貨易貨的辦法，這也是協定貿易的一種形式，但是這祗限於少數的商品。還有充量擴大其範圍的必要，庶幾能調整商品進出口，提高輸出貿易的數量。例如實行以貨易貨後的茶葉，年來輸出數量比較戰前就已大有增加，這是成功的一例。</p>
<p>此外中國政府對於淪陷區域的對外貿易，也應當特別注意。最近淪陷區域的對外貿易，常占全國貿易額的百分之八十以上。這是一個不可忽視的巨大經濟力量。現在政府僅以申請外匯辦法來限制淪陷區域的進口，但絕不能禁止淪陷區域不以輸出而換取進口；這是嚴重的戰時經濟問題，也是和軍事平行的政治問題！</p>
<h3 id="c3">日內閣今舉行緊急會議　決定津案談判政策　有田與克萊琪之初步談話似將取銷　決定日期並交換名單後即開始談判　一般預料會議前途黯淡恐無好結果 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>（東京）關於行將舉行之英日會議、日政府已商妥日本「不變態度」之各點、聞日政府已定明晨舉行內閣特別會議、俟各項決議經內閣會議通過後、外相有田赴葉山請日皇批准日本政策、據朝日新聞預料、有田與英大使克萊琪之初步談話、將予取銷、有田將與英大使布置開始會議之日期、並交換代表名單、然後全體代表立卽開始談判、「地方事件談判」似非要點、一般關切將集中於有田與克萊琪間、關於日本要求之談判、蓋日本所將要求者、爲英國表示在中國戰事中嚴守中立之志願、而以此爲天津爭案開始具體談判之初步條件、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）今晨外務省發言人招待新聞記者時宣稱、英日天津事件會議之議程、須待英大使克萊琪爵士與有田外相會晤後決定、兩氏大的將於下週晤談、衆料有田外相將要求、英國第一應表示願在中日戰事中保持嚴格之中立、該發言人吾認日政府與目下日本全國所舉行之反英運動有關、某記者叩以日木是吾煽動在華佔據區域內之反英運動、該發言人答稱、「此項問話、實爲侮辱」云、並謂渠對於各種微細事件、如最近靑島所發生之英領署被人投石等事、並未獲有情報、關於英國駐華武官史此亞之近狀、亦無消息可資發表、至於日方是吾曾通知北平英當局、將組織軍事法庭審問史氏、及曾吾邀請英代表參加審理、亦均無所聞云、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省發言人又稱、星期四日內閣將舉行緊念會議、決定津案談判之政策（十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>（東京）據日方消息、日方對於英日天津問題之談判、準備已妥、軍部外交兩方已將必要計劃擬定、隨時可以閒始談判、聞有田外相將請英國駐日大使克萊琪、於星期五日與彼一談、藉定談話開始之確實日期、大的英日雙方或更有在加藤松平之前開預備會之可能性、若然、正式會議大的可於星期六日開幕矣、（十二日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府高級官員、今日對於中闕時局在過去四十八小時中之變化、甚表關切、如由日人主使之羣衆、以磚石投擲英領事天津日軍對鎖英法租界事件、亦愈趨於嚴苛、凡此皆爲英日柬京談判、不致有何好結果之明證、屆時外人在華之處境必愈趨於嚴重、同時、日方又有將外人在華條的權利以及共他較廣大之問題、一併提出討論之消息、頗引起此問之注意、惟美國務卿赫爾、最近會宣稱、討論廣汎之問題、則勢將牽涉美國矣、此間對於日方將由軍事法庭審詢英國軍事參贊史披亞一事、亦表示驚異、蓋史氏爲外交官、享有治外法權之利益、故史氏之被捕、在文明國家之問、實屬無此先例也、（十二日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據英大使館方面消息、英日束京會議、必將陷入僵局之中、一則、雙方見解懸殊過甚、英國決不願討論凡足以影饗英國遠東立塲之問題、但在日本方面、則甚望討論此項問題、故卽使英日之問、關於英國助華問題、承認束亞新秩序問題、天津英租界銀行中保管之白銀能移交日方、則英日問之衝突、仍必時時發生、再則、英國自廣州·漢口·天津。皆已淪陷之後、及上海成爲孤烏之浚、則英國在遠東之也立、勢將愈處於困難、（十二日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日載外交訪員消息謂、日內閣在東京會談中提出較天津封鎖事更爲廣泛之問題、則談判不能成功、英政府自己旣不欲、他國亦不許討論、日方軍人所提更廣泛的關於在其侵略中國時、予以合作之要求云、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）爲使反英運動遍及全國起見、日本政友會與民政黨兩大政黨、已諭令各支部在各省各市各鎮組織反英大會、而通過力勸政府採取堅定態度、以與英國交涉之決議案、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（天津）今日蘇聯牛奶夫曾將牛奶兩車、供給英法租界、惟其後白俄績運牛乳至租界、卽爲日哨兵所阻止、故此間對於日哨兵之優容蘇聯牛乳夫一舉、認爲奇突、又據日軍發言人稱、漢口法租界當局興「武漢特別市之緊張關係、與天津局勢、並無關係、換言之、卽使漢口法租界受日方之封鎖、亦爲另一問題、與天津問題之解決、並無多大反響、（十二日美聯社電）</p>

<p>在黑龍江省西南與外縈接軍事上，自然是非常重要的事境處，有一條河向西北行注入貝兩湖的哈勒欣河，兩岸水草繁茂，宜於放牧。外蒙人原是遊牧民族，不大理會什麽國境疆界這一類事，他們看見對岸的水草好，就把自己的牲畜，趕了過去。可憐對岸受日軍統轄的幾個僞軍，旁的事情，雖一點不懂，但對於侵犯疆界這一類名字，却稍微有點領會，如今旣有外蒙人進來，似乎應該把他們驅逐出去，於是雙方的衝突開始了。</p>
<p>衝突開始</p>
<p>雙方旣有衝突，就不能沒有勝負，勝的方面，乘勢追擊，負的方面，迅速增援。甲方因乙方增援而受挫，就必設法取得大於乙方的增援而反攻乙方，乙方吃了虧，也必設法取得更大的增援而反攻甲方。如是者雙方繼續增援，繼續反攻，細小的一件衝突，很可引起大規模的戰爭。最近日方電傳，蘇聯已自西伯利亞具加爾湖區域，調動六萬大軍，援助外蒙。日方傳出這個消息，那就表明日本也要派遺相當此數或大於此數的援軍，對付蘇聯，於是蘇日雙方的戰事，將愈趨愈嚴重了。</p>
<p>這還單就諾蒙亭一帶的衝突而言，我們知道，偽滿與外蒙接壤處，不止哈勒欣河的沿岸，而且除這僞蒙交界處外，還有無窮的蘇聯與僞滿的接壤，將來諾蒙亨戰爭激烈時，也許有一方面，會用聲東擊西的方法，在雙方接界的另一個地方，突然進攻，以牽制對方軍力，以解諾蒙亨之圍。這原是極普遍的戰略，在像素僞接境綫那樣廣遠的傷合，這種戰略，更屬非常有用，易於實行。到那時，蘇日兩國的正式戰爭，也將從而發生了。</p>
<p>我們現在所欲研究的問題，究竟蘇日兩國的戰爭，是吾就會因此爆發呢？</p>
<p>日本計劃</p>
<p>蘇日兩國之間，遲早總要發生戰爭，不僅第三國的人民如此說，即蘇日雨國的人民，也如此承認。試想蘇聯在太平洋的二個要塞，即海參葳和哈巴羅甫斯克（舊利伯利）都有空軍根據地，而這兩處地方，離開東京和日本的其他工業區域，不過七百哩的距離。這在日本是無論如何不能忽視的事，照它的心意，最好蘇聯的防綫，往西遷移，移到貝加爾湖以西的地方，然後它所受的威脅，不致如此難堪。它歷來的政策，都向這個方針進行。例如一九一九年，它乘蘇聯內亂之際，動手佔領西伯利亞的濱海諸省，包括海參嵐在內，直到一九二三年，方迫於形勢，交還該項佔領地。又如自從一九〇五年日俄戰爭以後，日本本已割據俄屬庫頁島的南半，那是產油極富的區域，可是歐戰爆發後，它又進據北半島，直到一九二五年，才叉被迫交還。</p>
<p>日本在僞滿所施的鐵道政策，更是說明日木企圖把蘇聯勢力逐至貝加爾湖以西的野心。它從蘇聯購得中東鐵路以後，即着手添築支綫，內中有二條，直接與蘇境相接，有一條，直接與外蒙相接。同時它又在朝鮮那面，新闢撒興勒興二軍港，其目的在自此而後，日本開到北滿的軍隊，不必經由大連和南滿鐵道，可於輸送之時，縮短二三天的路程，這在</p>
<p>我們倘欲懂得它的用意，只狽把蘇聯在遠東的交通形勢，拿來做個比較。蘇聯在遠東的主要交通錢，自然是西伯利亞鐵道。那是與黑龍江平行的一條鐵道，在黑龍江之北，與黑龍江相距極近。一旦蘇日戰事爆發，日本可藉新軍港與新鐵道之便，於短時期內，輸送大兵，至黑龍江濱，截斷西伯利亞鐵道，使其東西不得連貫。此路一斷，蘇聯對遠東的軍隊，無法接濟，海參崴和哈巴羅甫斯克的駐軍，也斷了後路，這是日木給予蘇聯遠東軍隊的致命傷。</p>
<p>蘇聯對策</p>
<p>蘇聯看準日本的用意，趕緊發動對策，對策唯何，即在西伯利亞鐵道之北，築一西伯利亞鐵道的平行錢，從一偭位處貝加爾湖西首名呌塔宜（Taishet）的市鎮起，往東南行，直達太平洋的康梭模爾斯克（Konsomalsk）那裹是位處海參威北的另一新建市鎮，這條新築的鐵道，又在哈巴羅甫斯克，與西伯利亞鐵道相連。哈巴羅甫斯克是蘇聯駐遠東軍隊的大本營所在地，軍隊的防守，非常嚴密，日本很難從那個地方，再向北進，截斷那條新築的鐵道，那條鐵道，現已大部完成，不日即可通車，蘇聯有此準備，就算日本截斷它的西伯利亞鐵道，也不足懼。何況西伯利亞鐵道，現已敷設雙軌，幾處重要段落，且已敷設三軌，我們看到蘇日雙方的這樣的佈置，就知它們雙方用心之深與備戰之嚴了，然而它們兩國間的戰爭，决不會在此時發生</p>
<p>日方顧慮</p>
<p>就日本的地位來說，自然這樣的戰爭爆發得愈早愈好。蘇聯自大革命後，已有二個五年計劃，相繼完成，第三决五年計劃，正在進行，第四第五决五年計劃必將繼續下去。戰爭遲發一年，蘇聯就多有一年準備，在這延遲期內，日本的準備，雖也可以同時進行，不過日本的準備，幾已到達飽和點，不能以同一比例。與蘇聯並進，所以「早爲之所」，實於日本有利，不過在事實上，日本在中國的軍事，愈弄愈僵，不經三五年後，休想有個結東。它一想到這點，就不敢不相當讓步。何況日本木以「取巧」起家，它對中國的戰爭，當初也何嘗不想「取巧」，只因對於中國的民族意議，認識得不甚透切，所以弄巧成拙，現在它對付蘇聯，決不能再蹈覆轍。它所認爲「巧」的，即當蘇聯有事於歐洲時，它才開始動手，這樣，可收事半功倍之效，至於目前它總是先行強硬，強硬不得，再自行「識相」。</p>
<p>蘇聯態度</p>
<p>至於蘇聯方面，現在似乎也是大好機會，乘日本有事於中國時，突出奇兵，迎頭痛擊，定可致日木於死命。可是國際的牽連，決沒有迅樣簡單，蘇聯除東方的勁敵外，還有一個希特勒，伏在它的後面，須知德日的防共協定，率直地說，只是德日的謀蘇同盟罷了，其决，史丹林是一位極講現實主義的政治家，他在國內，正要從事建設，戰爭輿建設，勢難兩立，建設可以提高蘇聯的地位，戰爭將把蘇聯的國運，置於成敗未卜的險境。兩者相較，自以保持鎮靜，不輕言戰爭，更爲得計。何況蘇聯對日本的戰爭，不是「治療戰」，只是「預防戰」，旣是「預防戰」，能够避免，總以避免爲是。又何況現在中國與日木作戰，蘇聯不必親自出馬。只須實力援助中國，就可於同時期中，削弱日本勢力，收到「預防戰」的功效，在這種形勢之下，它又何必苦苦出頭作戰呢。</p>
<p>觀察前途</p>
<p>總之，日本現在而不能，蘇聯現在的地位，是可戰而無意，但其結果，則殊途同婦，可使蘇日兩國間的戰爭，暫時不致發生。</p>
<p>我們相信。諾蒙亨的結局，將和張鼓峯的結局相似。張鼓峯衝突時，日木揚言蘇聯軍隊，侵犯僞滿境界，蘇聯却回答說，它的人民，每年彼時，都到那個山峯上去走走，可見那是蘇聯的屬地。日木強硬些時，後來形勢不對，就軟了下來，讓蘇聯人民，繼續在裹個山峯上「走」着，道决諾蒙亨衝突，日本又稱外蒙人民，侵犯僞滿疆界，天皇有靈，倘能把外蒙的遊牧好手，從哈勒欣河的東岸。趕了出去，自屬上上大吉，吾則，等到一個時候，眞正幹不下去了，也只好讓這班好手，繼續在那裏放牧，直到冬季到臨，水草乾枯時爲止</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、依然盤旋状態、偶有起伏、無足重視、交易亦非常淸閒、各帮大致均袖手旁觀、中途雖某錢兌業續來吸收、無如現金號與銀樓帮均有供意、致遂演成此種呆滯局面、午刻聞外匯期貨帶緊、致價反跌爲漲、結果續漲二元、交易全日祗三百餘兩、銀樓飾金仍乏變化、海關金與中英純金等呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤祇好二元</p>
<p>自農每條（十兩）、初開市勢平疲、開市即做低二元、銀樓帮賣予金號三十兩、價二千五百八十八元、繼相同價現金號賣予銀樓帮三十兩、俄現金號又售予錢兌業十兩、價八十九元、時某錢兌業復興貿風、市勢向上、某錢兌業進某銀號五十兩、價則相同、繼而又進金號五十兩價九十元、後另一錢兌業亦進銀樓帮廿兩、價亦九十元、瞬即又抬二元、某錢兌業進銀樓帮與同業各五十兩、價均九十二元、午刻回挫二元、錢兌業互做五十兩、九十元爲午收價、午後成交愈淸、市象堅穩、開市即做高二元、令號互做五十兩、價九十二元、此後延至三時未見做開、故晚收仍作二千五百九十二元、結果比上日績漲二元、全天祇四元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價二千六百元、收進二千五百八十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢極鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、均無更動、大同行仍懸二百六十二元、新同行爲二百六十元、收進二百五十四元、</p>
<p>中英純金均定</p>
<p>十一日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯仍呆定於七鎊八先令六辦士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價仍屬一千二百十二元三角、一掛牌海關金仍爲二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金便亦仍爲一千二百〇七元六角、</p>

<p>自美國行白銀政策，已達六年之久，始終持着抬高銀價之政策，所以金銀比價，能保持一定之水準，最近因美國有停購白銀之舉，各國銀價一致慘落，如倫敦大條價已由十九辦士六二五跌至十六辦士八七五，而本市銀價暗市，因政府禁止輸運私藏及淪陷區內受某方之搜刮，籌碼素少，又因一般商人以貨少居奇，盡力購藏，致價格每兩會高達二元八角二分，自受此影響，一般昔日持有者，紛紛吐出，故市價一度會跌至二元三角五分，然銀樓飾品製兌價格，並未减低，乃望銀價回升也。及美參議院通過折衷方案，仍准羅斯福總統有貶低美元及繼續購買白銀之權，聞國內購銀價格，改定爲七角一分一盎斯，外國購價改爲三角五分，但須逐日變更，視倫敦大條行市之漲跌爲轉移，且一般投機家鑒於前途樂觀，大肆搜購，故趨勢則屬良好，本市聞已回高至二元四角，銀價之得以重復平穩，對我國國際金融，不無重大裨益也。（星）</p>

<p>上日在跌之紗市、昨則稍現回蘇之象、查其良好之原因、（一）則上日人心之驚惶失措、未免過甚、引起一小部份復來塌便宜貨、（二）則廣帮昨晚有款匯滬、滇帮買去十支粗紗一百七十包、香港進二十支雙馬特金城兩牌爲最夥、其餘組紗共計僅三百五十包未滿、該帮稍有實銷一來、發動採辦、人氣頓時提高、回升數元、然在此目前銀根緊縮之際、根本未許過分昂騰也、且加之他紗日形下墜不振、較華紗允廉、深恐鵲巢鳩占矣、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、因國風抵滬、勢甚狂暴、路途行走困難、到市集會者較平時减少三分之二、相延至十時以外、才有做開行市、開價即漲二三元、因上日跌風太兇、反動叉起、同時廣東叉有零星納胃、二十支雙馬外棧售價爲四百七十七十三五元、中途平靜、無甚變遷、至於大戶心中看漲觀念殊深、無如爲環境所不許、舉動稍見安定也、查半日成交統計八百七十包、上日午後成交一百七十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲三元、牧羊漲五元、其餘與上日彷彿、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>近十年的呢絨　售價，在最近物價高漲之狀態下，倒也値得回觀，呢絨向售銀兩，到廢兩改元之後，二十二年起，始用國幣定價，所以看到下表時候，第一要注意此點，關於十九年至二十一年的價格，欲與二十二年價格比較，最少要用七一五換算爲國幣，方可比較，再看二十年呢絨漲價的理由，爲了施行新稅則，稅餉提高，售價也高，可是好景不常，二十一年一二八一役，使上海市面打破了，呢絨行市亦下跌，二十二年係用國幣論價，實際仍比廿一年同時期略小，二十四年日木呢絨的傾銷，行市更形疲憊了，二十七二十八年貨價上漲不已，都爲外匯貴，到貨缺的影響，允以最近市價爲最高，比之民國十九年，所漲多在一倍，亦有在倍以上，就是今年貿一尺，在十九年可買兩尺或兩尺有零。也可以說，今年做一件衣服，民國十九年可做兩件了。</p>

<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市晨初先因海外棉商在市拋售及一部份多頭了結而疲乏、後因孟買及利物浦來電告漲而轉好、美棉區中部及西部昨叉降下不需耍之雨水、有礙棉產收量、華盛頓方面聞將以出口津貼增至爲每包六元二角半至八元七角半之問、共貼費之昇降、則由政府隨時決定之、其主旨則以棉市之漲落爲依歸、昨日紐的漲二磅音、印度連同預測漲二羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日趨靜寂、然華北方面需棉甚殷、滬上已有數行設法將棉運往、以易棉紗及其他各種產品、某德商洋行日來收購印棉二千餘件、俱係運往靑島云他家尚無交易聞、</p>
<p>中外棉市完全陷入停滯之境、廠號皆無需要、一筆交易、終未成交、蘇北來源輸船以颶風抵滬、不能行駛、故碼頭上船隻未曾有到、大概天氣轉青後一併來巾矣、</p>

<p>衆業公所股市、因局勢不定、致股市平靜而疲弱、昨日之大風雨使一般經紀人及客戶未能到所、亦爲市面呆淡之另一原因、怡和股續疲、價十八元二角、惟電話股有起色、漲至十二元一角、若局勢與天氣仍然如此、則市氣轉佳之希望甚微、</p>

<h3 id="c143">夏令衛生要旨 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>又是夏天啦！一到了夏天，爲的疾病比別季格外盛行，所以會使人想到衛生問題也特別要注意。這裹，姑就個人所想到的，把衣食住行各方面夏令應注意的幾種衛生事件，分述在下面。</p>
<p>衣的衛生夏天所穿的是單薄衣服，一弄就會骯髒，所以要勤加洗滌，最好是每天要換。關於天氣方面，夏天早晚比中午要凉得多，所以早晚的衣服，也要穿得比較厚些，不能貪凉爽而懶於更換。過於緊小的衣服，穿在着肉，不適衛生，尤其是發育沒有完全的男女靑年，切不可愛時髦而穿小衣服。</p>
<p>食的衛生夏天吃東西最要留心，如果不留心，就會害病，夏天也就格外厲害。家裹的飯菜，可能的話，都要自己煮，館子上的東西，還是少吃些好。一切吃的東西，都要罩好，怕蒼蠅躲過，隔夜的東西，也不吃爲妙。攤頭上露天的食物，都不能　吃。冷飲物品不吃最好，要吃也不能過度。碗碟須當天洗過，要洗得乾淨。絕對不能吃不開的水。</p>
<p>住的衛生夏天的時節，居室之中，窗戶耍洞開。不抢是天井裹或屋子裹面，每天要洒臭藥水。最好是裝紗窗，以防蚊蠅的飛入。家裹如果有病人，應得要隔離，要是傳染病，馬上把病人送進醫院。倘若所住的地方，有蚊蟲的話，那牀上要裝紗帳。不拘那一間居屋，非得勤加洗掃不可。一切器物，也耍時加揩拭，以防發生霉菌。</p>
<p>行的衛生在夏天，要是沒有事情的話，還是少出去的好。如果要買東西或爲了其他事項，還是早晚出去的比較好。因爲中午出去，太陽光強烈，容易中暑。就是早晚，路也不能十分多走。每天的早上，最好到公園裹去走走，吸些新空氣，散散步也是有益衛生的。你在路上，走得滿頭大汗之時，不可趁一時的苦熱，多吃冷飲物品。就是耍吃，也以少吃爲妙。</p>
<p>住在上海的人們，在夏天，對於衣食住行能够這樣的注意衛生，我相信一定可减少許多疾病，能够很安穩的度過夏天的。</p>
<h3 id="c144">游泳衣 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>夏季裏，做何種運動最適宜？足球籃球太劇烈，耐不住過份的熱，本來夏季是網球季，可是這類玩意兒不能普遍，因此炎蒸蒸的太陽光底下還是往游冰池裹跳，化上幾毛錢（買長期券更便宜）淴一個統體浴，又能練習練習游泳，同時擠滿了很多美人魚的池子裹，我們加入進去凑凑熱鬧，至少是一椿很有趣的事呀。</p>
<p>說到游泳，就想起了游泳衣，常然，只要向店家去買一件就算啦，不過我們要揀一件最稱心的游泳衣，普通的游泳衣大概都是和汗杉一般的式子，下面聯着一條褲子而已，人在水裏最輕便應該大家赤裸裸的一絲不掛，這様似乎太不文明了，穿一件衣服遮藍些不可公開的地方，所以質料貴乎柔軟，並且愈輕愈好，眞絲織的游泳衣就能具有這兩點優長，但是價値很貴，像報紙上載張善琨先生到香港去替童月娟女士買的一件不是要數十元嗎？平常一般人應用的大多是棉紗織的，價値也至少需在一元以上，由此，游泳這項運動，在都市裹不能十分發達也許就是它化費多的關係。</p>
<p>最近，外國新發明一種游泳衣，可以使不會游冰的人都穿淸它而浮在水面上，賽如套了救命圈一樣，所以初學游泳的人很可一用，這種游泳衣是用織物製成，內塡賽璐珞製的本囊，和巴西所產一種極輕的草，能供給很大的浮力，談游泳的人浮住不沉下，這種游泳衣外覜上和尋常的雜不多，可是效用比較大了。</p>

<p>夏季吃菜，總要吃得淸爽，肥魚大肉，未免有些望而生畏。然而魚肉未嘗不可吃，只要配製得當，就可减少油膩，譬如乾菜紅燒肉，猪肉不要切成整塊而切成小小的薄片，乾菜放得多些，那麽所有肉油，都被乾菜吸去，就不覺油膩，而乾菜囚多了肉油之故，反而入味了。還有鮮荷葉粉蒸肉，是夏季名菜之一，將猪肉切成薄塊，在上好醬油中多浸一會，然後　了糯米粉，用鮮荷葉切成方形，一一包裹起來，隔水蒸熟，吃起來清香可口，也不覺得肉的油膩。牛肉做的洋葱牛肉絲，捲心菜番茄牛肉湯等，那是並不油腻的。至於魚類，根本不像猪肉那麽油膩，何況淸燉淸蒸，都很淸爽，還有將魚先在油裹爆過，然後與冬瓜同煮，也是很適宜於夏季的口味的。</p>

<h3 id="c146">談吃素 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 何立三</p>
<p>有人說：蔬菜之類，富於「維他命」及鐵質。所以吃素，足以養生。提倡素食，是最適合於衛生的。這話，固然未可厚非。其實講到攝生之法，一個人也不一定要吃素。因爲吃素吃得長久了，飮食方面，脂肪質太形缺乏，營養不足，於身體健康，反要受到不良的影饗。甚至會釀成貧血症。在下是以醫爲業的，從經騐事實的告訴。常見有許多吃長素的婦女們，往往體弱多病。叉因食物的範圍太狹，胃口也會不好。飲食少進，身體自然日形疲乏。而且多數吃長素的人，根本不曉得攝生。他們的腦筋裏，充滿着迷信觀念。以爲吃了素，戒殺生，受着菩薩保佑。下世轉胎，會做個有福氣的人。於是平日受了這迷信和消極的束縛，把人生最緊要的「食慾」，來強自抑制。你想，這樣的吃素，完全是違反「自然生活，」豈非是有損而無益？我國自來最講衛生的，要算是孔二先生。而有「食色牲也」之說：主張「食不厭精。」其理亦可以深長思了。總之凡事貴「適性，」吃素也要有個標準。有時應該吃素，有時不應該吃素。譬如身子不適，在有病的當兒，自然要戒食葷腥。或在暑天炎熱的時候：也要吃得素淨些爲妙。折衷之法。吃葷與吃素，宜相輔而行，不可偏執。過嗜肉食厚味，同然有碍衛生。長期吃素，也不見得於衛生有益。所謂「太過不及，其害一也。」這耍在我人自己的選擇了。</p>
<h3 id="c147">從吃水果說到亂拋果殼 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>芳春既悄悄地逝去了，炎夏早又洶洶的闖來了，以「春花夏菓」，來說，夏的季節，可說是瓜菓類的大熟時期，走到市上，觸目皆是，在這號稱孤島的上海，依舊能够源源的從異地運來，這不能說不是孤島上人們的口福了。</p>
<p>水菓是西洋人在餐後的副食品，據說是能够助消化，淸陽胃的，便是我們的宴會席上，也有四碟水某，用來佐酒解醒，而且在暑天裹，食瓜菓，確是解暑消渴的妙品，所以我並不反對吃水菓，但我對於水菓，擬有兩項戒例；（一）不成熱及腐爛的菓實小宜吃，（二）絕對不應將瓜菓的皮殼隨地拋棄，允甚在通衛之間！前者固然是食之有碍衛生，甚至引起疾病，而後老却是惡習慣的養成，每見中下階級的人們，在街頭買了菓實，隨走隨吃，而且隨手將菓殼向街心拋去，這是最惡劣的！我試解釋如决；沿街吃水菓者，本人續不爲不美觀，但亂拋皮殼，究是達警律的舉動，一也，菜殻齷齪吸引蛟蠅　集，妨碍公衆衛生，二也，行人偶不經心，踏着受滑傾跌，有損道德，三也，有道多的不良印象，故而我特舉出來，深望亂拋瓜皮菓殼的人們切戒爲是！</p>
<h3 id="c148">談談冷飮 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 心佛</p>
<p>一到熱季，什麽生意都要呈著清淡，惟冷飲品有應接不暇之勢。像八一三事變以前，內地有成千成萬担的西瓜運到上海來販賣，現在因爲運輸上的不便，和種種限制，恐怕一般平民不能享受這種口福吧。所以去年木埠冷飲業酸梅湯冰棒，供不應求，銷數打破歷來紀錄。因爲價格低廉，味也雋美，冰棒允便於飲食，雖走在路上，坐在車上，臥在楊上，都可一枝在手，取凉却暑。不過市上很多雜牌，製迭草率，食之頗多危險最好指購有名的出品如美女牌冰輪牌金駝牌等數種，因爲他們的確用沸水製成的。</p>
<p>時髦人物，公子哥兒，一到夏天，冰淇淋鮮橘水成爲他們唯一的飲料。像蘇嘉一帶，有一種家製冷飲「凉粉」，味道並不遜於上述二種，现在已有國產凉粉出售，製法極簡，只耍與水混煮凝結，打成小塊，以冰凍薄荷水冲入，加白糖及家製梅醬即成，止渴生津，雋美爽口夏季巳到，不妨請上海朋友在家裹試試看。（按梅醬用熟梅煮爛，除去酸露，加入白糖，越多煮越妙，市上並無出售。）</p>
<h3 id="c149">關於游泳的話 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 競爭</p>
<p>游泳池都已開幕了：當然，住在繁囂的都市中的人們，又可得到一個比較一清靜」的處所。身上是薄薄的衫褲，池裹的水又是那麽的陰涼，滿身的悶熱，一躍入水，便可解除；誰說沒有樂趣呢？并且它也是一種強身運動，可以使你肌肉的綫條健美，眞是再好也沒有　！</p>
<p>這裹想吿訴你一些游冰應注意的事：我們的游泳時間，最好在早晨或是餐後的兩小時左右；入水之前，應該先作幾分鐘和緩的運動及深呼吸，使全身發暖，使四肢靈活，入水後可以更活潑一些。在水裹如果感到身體有點疲乏，或是身體發冷，那就應該立刻出水休息；要是你是初决練習的話，那末，你留在水中的時閒，每决最好不要超過三十分鐘。游泳之前呢，最好要用棉花塞住耳道，外面再塗以凡士林之類的東西；如果不用棉花，那就得在游畢的時候，不要忘了拭乾耳內的水，免得發生耳道炎症。游泳之後還須用乾的毛巾摩擦全身，至皮膚發紅爲止；這樣地常常摩擦，可以強健皮　哩！如果遇到抽筋時，宜設法按矆息處，或以熱水敷摩。</p>
<p>還有幾點應特別留心的：我們如果要游泳，最好人比較多些，因爲單獨游泳是危險的事。在飽食之後，不宜游泳，因爲要妨碍消化機能。身體不甚舒適時，也不要去游泳。長途步行之後，或是劇烈運動之後，都不宜游泳，許多人最忽略這一點，殊不知身體的熱度變化太連，會發生抽筋或共他疾病的！</p>
<p>倘使你不善於游泳，在不知水的深淺的地方，不應作躍水的練習；對於救生法沒有相當研究，就不能留險地入水救人，只宜在岸上用器械，或其他的方法去施救。</p>
<p>這許多，有點是聽來的，有的是參考來的，總有幾分是相當有價値的，寫在這兒，貢獻給活曜在碧波中的許多人們</p>

<h3 id="c150">除臭蟲的方法 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— （陳明禧）</p>
<p>天氣漸漸的熱起來了，上海將成臭蟲世界。最苦的是中下等人家，板縫中，床墊上，橙椅間，差不多都有這種吮血動物潛伏着。現在筆者有幾種淸除臭蟲的方法，諸位府上，如有被臭蟲騷擾的，不妨擇其便捷而易覓的一種試行。</p>
<p>第一法　用挑葉搗爛，塗塞於臭蟲所居的罅孔中，臭蟲嗅得氣味，立即僵斃，永不復活，如嫌桃葉汁染及帳被，留着汚跡，那麼可用乾枯的桃葉，研成粉末，散於被蓆床板間，也有同樣的功效。</p>
<p>第二法將　麥桿舖在被褥下，再用蕎麥稭和水煎沸，趁熱澆入罅孔中，臭蟲立斃。</p>
<p>第三法將鰻魚的骨刺，和穿山甲研成細末，在床下煨燒，臭蟲最怕這一種氣味，嗅後立即畢命。</p>
<p>上面這三種方法，都是輕而易舉的；而且所費無幾，筆者會親自試騐過，非常靈驗，敢爲介紹於讀者，可免一夏的騷擾。</p>
<h3 id="c151">夏季的衣食住行 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 禪塵</p>
<p>暮春已悄然飛逝，時代巨輪却偷偷地揚開了新夏的序幕，季節更移了，人們的生活自然也有相當變化。</p>
<p>夏季是疾病最猖獗活躍的一個時期，霍亂，吐瀉，痬螺痧，虎列拉，更令人談虎色變，有人以爲夏季能够平安過去，別的時侯更可放心了，這並非過甚其辭，倒是實在的話，所以我們對於夏天裹的衣，食，住，行，日常生活，不可不格外謹愼，現在是夏季的開始，談那些問題，雖嫌過早，但「未雨綢繆」，預先討論討論，也是好的。</p>
<p>衣，夏天的衣服，但求輕便簡單，不如別的季節穿了一件又一件的麻煩化費，從前夏天的衣料，大多探用紡綢，印度綢之類，取其輕飄凉暢，但是現在這個當兒，淪陷區域裹的人民，那裹能够安心樂業於育蠶繅絲，那些質料自然是　貨人造絲居多，要是對得起自己良心的話，那種衣料還是少穿爲是。道地國貨，要推廣拷，香雲紗，和萬載夏布。旣堅牢，叉大方，大家不妨做來穿穿，只恐怕今年貨色不多罷了，至於夏天衣料的顏色，以白色爲最妥，因爲它能把太陽光反射出去。那些黑色或深色的衣服，要吸收陽光，非常燠熱。還有，在夏天裹我們雖不要扮成風度翩翩的「荷花大少」，但赤膊短褲，却旣礙觀瞻，又不衛生，希望絕對免除。</p>
<p>食，那是最要緊的一樁事。所謂「禍從口出，病從口入，」尤其夏天的疾病，什九從飲食不慎而起。因爲夏天天氣炎熱，人類的胃腸，比較能力薄弱。所以淤好不要吃那些油膩葷腥等不易消化的食物，這些東西都於身體康健有所妨礙。有些人在夏天主張素食，並非眞相修仙成佛，實在是攝養衛生之道，値得提倡。還有些人貪圖小便宜，吃食廉價不衛生的冰洪淋，酸梅湯鮮橘水，菉豆湯等東西，都是致病之由，應謹慎小心。夏天裹還有一種可惡的東西——蒼蠅，脚上帶了些微生蟲，飛東飛西的害人，大凡一個人偶一不愼吃了蒼蠅釘過的食物，保險生病，所以大家都要起來撲滅它。</p>
<p>住，孤島居，大不易，平常湫隘鴿籠式的房屋，已擠得令人透不過氣，到了夏天，更容易中暑發痧。找個寬舒些房干吧，一則孤烏有人滿之患，房屋求過於供，那裹去找尋。二則即使像沙漠中發現了水源，找到所比較寬暢房子，那味了良心的二房東，以爲「奇貨可居」，討出來的價錢，更令你舌咋氣沮，「鼻子上掛鹹鐵」，休想休想。所以今年夏天「居住」，倒是個很嚴重的問題。有些人因爲居處偪仄，沒有法子，就一個枕頭一條蓆的露天過宿，雖貪凉一時，却要弄出毛病來。還是大家把房屋整理一整理，挪出些空地方來，大家心平氣和，精神上得到一些安靜，或許可以驅除些暑氣。</p>
<p>行，夏天的行動，要比別的季節簡單些。太陽底下東奔西走，很容易中暑　熱，並且一行動就汗出如瀋，非常不便。所以夏天裹一切無謂的　酬和不必要的行動，還是「歇夏」爲妙。</p>
<p>上而所講的只就一般普通平民而言，至於那些洋房坐汽車階級，却又當別論。</p>

<h3 id="c152">自我宣傳 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>據說文人的自我宣傳，是一種頗帶流行性的鄙習。但我想問題是在於自我宣傳的動機，如果動機在於個人的私利，那麼縱不能即武斷之謂為卑鄙行為，至少這樣的宣傳也是無甚價值的。不過因為有了『我』的關係在內，就連客觀動機的介紹批評也一槪　之為鄙習，那就未免太束　了學術的廣　意義。</p>
<p>譬如一個作家寫了一篇東西，只許別人對之批評，自己禁發一言，否則就得受『自我宣傳』的譏諷，這種態度，使用之學術的探討上，我認為是很不公平的。這樣的態度，在西歐學術界裹已很少見，但在我們中國的文人間却仍頗流行。　在舉術的進步上，是一重很大的妨礙。</p>
<p>我個人認為與其排斥自我宣傳，還不如連自我吹噓也讓它存在。理由是在學術的探討上，自我吹噓决不能有長時間的生存可能；吹噓或可蒙蔽讀者於一時，但吹噓者的本身也僅能有利那的存在機會。反之，解放客觀的自我宣傳，就是給予學術研究更大的自由。作者對其本身寫作的東西，敢於自我介紹，敢於表示自己作品的觀點，這樣對於別的批評者及一般讀者，豈非是一種幫助？</p>
<p>自我宣傳雖然是一個不大受人歡迎的名詞，自我批判却早被人接受為一種進步性的工具。其實自我宣傳和自我批判，不外是自我認識的兩種手段：一是積極性的，一是消極性的。非客觀的自我批判，實際上就是主觀的自我宣傳——吹噓；客觀的自我宣傳，即等於客觀的批判。</p>
<p>一個旣成名的作家，往往受讀者的要求或出於自發，將其作品中的若干種特別推荐給讀者。這種行為，我們也可說是自我宣傳。而這樣的自我宣傳，幾乎每個名作家都為之而　無愧色。因為這種宣傳的作用完全出於純潔的自我認識，沒有半分私利的作用在內。像這樣自我推荐的作品，有時雖仍免不了作者本人的偏愛之見，但在多數塲合，確是作者的代表作。</p>
<p>我並不建議將自我宣傳作為學術推進上一種獨立工具，因為這樣做流弊很大。我的意思是將其當作自我認識的一種手段，與另一種手段的自我批判相應為用。</p>
<p>若以為自我批判即係自我認識，是不够的。因為批判只盡了消極方面的任務；積極的自我策勵還得特之具有自信心的自我宣傳。</p>
<p>最後要聲明的，這里的『宣傳』，决非是指政治術語上用之已濫的宣傳，而是指　　的本來含意——信念之自我發揚。</p>
<h3 id="c153">冒廣生的疚齋雜劇 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>新近讀到冒廣行的「疚齊雜劇」，想說幾句話。</p>
<p>冒廣生，字鶴亭，江蘇如阜人，是「影梅庵憶語」的作者冒辟疆的後裔。疚齊雜劇以外，還有「小三吾亭詞」（原名疚齊口業）等。他的散文曾被選入新古文辭類　。他的哲嗣舒湮就是「戰鬥中的陜北」的作者。</p>
<p>我曾在一個曲集，見過冒老先生一面。我說普通話，他就與我說流利的國語，後來他又對其他的相識說江西話和湖廣話，可說是有語言天才的——大約是很有風趣的人吧？白鬚飄飄，又使我無端地想起豐子愷了。「別離廟」中的「乖乖龍東」一語，尚不過是本色當行，未能盡冒老之長呵。</p>
<p>疚齊雜劇凡雜劇八種，其中有好幾處是提到作者的先人的。「別離廟」以冒辟疆為主角，自不必說：卽以他人為主角的雜劇中也常提到；如「鄭妥娘」劇中就曾提到冒辟疆所題的軍中說劍圖，「馬湘蘭」劇中則提到「冒伯　」所選的秦淮四美人詩稿。林琴南「夕照寺為冒巢民先生作生日記」云：「鶴亭淹博能詩，干巢民先生，雖斷縑零素，必拾而藏之」。其對於先人遺澤，如此珍愛，無怪乎劇中屢次提起了。</p>
<p>冒老又喜談佛，「葉女歸魂」和「南海神」多佛家語，這只要看他的疚齊口業弁言，自謂「疚齊學佛垂四十年」，也就可以知道他在劇中喜談佛理之故了。</p>
<p>作者讀者當亦不少，「別離廟」中的鵲踏枝近似思凡，「馬湘蘭」中的悠悠曲則近似徐渭的四　猿。</p>
<p>這八個雜劇都是以明末的女性為題材的，前四種的人物是吳蕊仙，葉小　，馬湘蘭和卞玉京。人各一折，體例如四聲猿和四嬋娟。後四種的人物是王華姜，雲　娘，　娘和鄭妥娘。她們的對手便是屈大均，陳其年等。其中有些文人眼看國家將亡，變態地縱情聲色，作慢性自殺，雖非我們所應效法，其心情却是可憫的。此處只是節引一些警句：「誰識靈均心事苦」。（　末開塲）「無奈天何，念家山破，……亡命　　舸。家國無窮淚滿巾，　巢凄絕僅完身」。（別離廟）「中山王女，未入宮而亂作，北兵以一鞭，驅之而去。」（卞玉京）「眼見中原方鹿失，誰云女子不雄飛」。「似秦良玉一般慷慨，比龍　峻娘子軍驕」。（雲　娘）「江頭燕子，舊壘都非」。「　宏光南渡，草草江山，鳥衣王謝總凋殘」。「愁煩，這山河忍淚看」。（鄭妥娘）</p>
<p>曲終奏雅，我以為最後登柳敬亭是最值得稱讚的人物。我戴了有色眼鏡來看，頗希望冒老再寫一篇雜劇，一顯冒辟疆在南京　留　防亂揭當時的豪氣。</p>
<p>與疚齊雜劇同樣使我喜愛的是最近冒先生的一首龍山會：「兵火正漫天，南北遍燕　吳楚。算年年悲秋，不似今年更苦」</p>

<p>（一）要常想到上帝是無所不在的，要像詩人那樣說：「我往那裹去躱避你的靈？我往那裹去躱避你的面？我若升到天上，你在那裹，我若在陰間，你也在那裹，一個人如果常常存這種思想，那末，日子久了，對於上帝自然會生一種　畏之心，一切行為都是謹慎小心，不敢茍且。我們的行為必須純潔無疵，不可犯一點罪，因為在末日審判的時候，主的審判極其嚴明，無法可以閃　。　（二）無論看作什麼東西，都要想到上帝存在那裹，並且要想到上帝的能力和恩典。譬如看見太陽，就想到上帝的光榮；看見火，就想到上帝的熱情；看見水，就想到上帝的慈　，上帝降下甘露，使萬物孕育，供給人們生活方面的需要，同時，他又給我們心靈上的安慰。如果我們存着這　觀念，就能助長我們的善心，　固我們的道心，而驅除一切邪念妄想。　（三）一個人在燕居獨處之時，應當多默念上帝。　時有一位聖者說：「黑想的功夫，就是在心裹蓋造　殿，給上帝居住。」　（四）上帝住在我們裹面，同時也住在我們的弟兄們裹面，所以我們的弟兄缺少了衣食，我應當　濟他，上帝必定喜歡。　（五）世間一切生靈都是上帝所造的，和我們人類一樣為上帝所愛護，所以我們對任何生物都不可　待殘害。（待續）上海基督教文字佈道會　　一二二七號）</p>

<p>— 可山</p>
<p>近來很有許多驚人的消息，可從各種新聞上看到，說：幾時幾時，要怎樣怎樣了；幾時幾時，要怎樣怎樣了。但每個人的心理都希望這些不會成事實。</p>
<p>現在且不談這些，來談談以往的事實吧。因為剛巧上海新　的一家海天書店，要我　校宋朝徐夢莘編的「三朝北盟會編」，就引起了我的談　。其中按年　事，把徽宗欽宗高宗三朝四十五年間與金人和戰的事蹟編集起來，採輯　野記載至三百幾十種之多，成為一部一百三十萬言的鉅著。中國的「狄岱麓」紀曉嵐先生曾評為「淹博詳　，在當時諸著中，無有能過之者」。可見是一部很有價值的書。</p>
<p>我所校的是靖康二年，（宋高宏的年號）徽欽被　後，金人立太　張邦昌為帝的一段事實。</p>
<p>那時金人决意不呌趙氏統治了，但中國的民心却非常激昂極擁護朝廷，使金人不敢直接取為已有。自從欽宗赴　城　塞後，每天就有士庶數千集南　門迎侯車　，後來竟至招集道士，和尚沿街設　祈禱，弄得滿城　聲喧天，香烟繚繞，雖近於迷信，而民心的歸向，是很明白的。又一段寫李若水抗諭　　說：</p>
<p>是日讀詔罷，　罕使　慶脫御服，若水向前抱持上，令不可脫，云：「這　亂做，此是大朝真天子，你殺狗輩不得無禮。」左手抱上，右手指粘罕罵之，被數　人打破　　激血，　過一邊，見上　了御服，即時氣絕倒地，少頃，人各散去，若水亦稍　。</p>
<p>這也可表現那時人民對於國家的忠誠，使金人不敢把中國一口吞下去。</p>
<p>那時最活躍的　　吳　兩人，逼太上皇（徽宗）入　　，取皇后皇子，都是他兩人做的事。這時金人旣不敢收中國土地為已有，呌在朝首官推選一位可以代　氏做皇帝的人，但太子太傅孫傅等先後四次申狀　前，仍存趙氏。後來民　知這金人要危害國　，都相顧號　，至今四　彈　，並呌個大國奸范　來撫論軍民。</p>
<p>金人令　集百官推選一位異性皇帝，但究竟推選誰呢？會編紀著說：</p>
<p>王時雍又令范　把省門，以舉　張邦昌事說論軍民等，於內前府更，臺吏，奪呼，令速具名銜推戴，異議者押赴軍前。而軍民，者老，僧道，回顧無言，唯唯面退，獨太學諸生對以「某等所見……」　殆不然。　恐軍民視效，乃高聲折衆曰：「當今為忠，不可只可為孝」，遂令同人歸學，時孫傅張叔夜已出，獨時雍主其　，　百官　，但見出白紙十幔，令書職位姓名而退；悲詞秘之，不以示衆，薄　，吳升莫　繳狀以出。</p>

<p>瓦西卡那應報的日子也終於到來了。</p>
<p>有一天晚上，在妓女們還沒有到客堂去接客之前，她們正敞着衣服在餐　裹用晚飯，那時候，其中一個呌做　達·米爾諾古落瓦的——一個大胆心地狠惡，而又疏瀨的女子——她憑着窗往外望著說道：</p>
<p>『瓦西卡來了。』</p>
<p>一陳憂　的漫罵飛散開來。</p>
<p>『快來看！　達呌道，那傢伙醉了。跟警察在一起……快來看！』</p>
<p>大家跑到窗邊去。</p>
<p>『人家正在給他脫衣服啊！……大家看！』麗達很高興的呌着，『囑，他受傷啦！』</p>
<p>餐室裹散發着　罵和惡意的笑聲，——是復仇的喜悅的笑聲。妓女們　互扭作一團，奔向門口去迎接那沒有援助的仇敵。</p>
<p>她們看見　官和馭者扶着瓦西卡。瓦西卡面色蒼白，額上湧着大顆的汗珠，　了的左腿在後面拖着。</p>
<p>『瓦西卡！來諾內支！這是什麼回事！』　母呌着。</p>
<p>瓦西卡無力的搖着頭，嘶啞的回答道：</p>
<p>『跌壞啦……』</p>
<p>『從木馬上跌下來的。……』警官說，『跌落了，腿子挾在車盤中，折斷了……就這麼回事！』</p>
<p>妓女們沉默起來了，但是她們的眼睛，發著火般的光輝。</p>
<p>人們把瓦西卡抬到閣樓上去，放在床上，一邊呌人去請醫生。妓女們站在他的床邊，面面相　的，一聲不響。</p>
<p>『滾開去！』瓦西卡對她們說。</p>
<p>一個也沒有動。</p>

<h3 id="c159">壞人的話（上） <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 王獻齋</p>
<p>編者介紹：王獻齊獻身銀幕極早，久負「反派角色第一人」盛譽；但他本人，却是一位好好先生。茲就本文所述，知係有激使然，足見他在銀幕上獲得的成功是大有由來，而且又很見趣妙的。</p>
<p>在電影界濫竽了近二十年，演過的片子計在百部以上；因為向來專演反派角色，至今所得結果，是給觀衆留下了個「無惡不作」的惡劣印象，和博得不少「標準壞蛋」與「壞人」之類的惡名與咒　。我常想念着很覺好笑：做人要如真的做到這般地步，顯然是被「千夫所指」，真該早就「無疾而終」了！</p>
<p>「王獻齊這壞蛋，他在銀幕上就從沒做過一次「好人」。不錯，這確是實在的情形。但是我又為什麼要專做「壞人」呢？我就真的絕不會做「好人」嗎？最簡捷的一句話：這實在全由環境迫我如此，亦即是心頭上蘊藏着一腔怒火，總覺非似這樣一洩為快不可，而所由促成的。</p>
<p>在銀幕上的表現，我是一位「十惡不赦」的大罪人；這裹就如罪徒一般！願意將我作惡的由來與經歷，來作一番很誠摯的供詞。</p>
<p>一念作惡的動機</p>
<p>我在小的時候，是生長在海參崴的。父親係當地著名商人，事業亦做得不小。不幸在我十一歲那年，他老人家却一病不起，拋下我們母子數人與世長辭了。我的母親苦於不識字，自己又是一個年紀很輕的孩子；關於一切財產事務，便都全由幾位親屬掌管。不料，他們却是真正的壞人，為此在他們　寡婦孤兒，儘由偽造筆據和玩出各種花樣，力圖侵攫家財之下，不上幾年工夫，便已受及了絕大禍害。</p>
<p>這一番慘痛的回憶，和那些貌為和善的陰險小人的面容與作派，永遠深深地　在我的腦裹；後來厠身社會，受到不少被欺詐，被壓迫的遭遇，神經上亦刺　十分厲害。就為在冷眼觀察下，壞人的面孔看得太多，壞人的惡行耳濡目染的亦真不少；故於踏進電影界後，立意就想憑這一點「經騐」，把他們作為模仿對象。因此一念作惡，至於成為一個罪大惡極的「壞人」。</p>
<p>我做「壞人」的動機是有激使然；我做「壞人」的目的是想發生一點感化效力。希望世人將來全沒壞人，我這銀幕上的「壞人」，至時亦即無從作惡了。</p>

<p>好萊塢集製片公司現將拍攝一張巨片名呌：「一個德國間諜的懺悔」（Coufessi　on　of　a　Nazi　Spy）片中當然時常需要希特勒的鏡頭，但是找　了全好萊塢，沒有一人完全酷肖希特勒而能担任這重要角色的，沒辦法之下，導演先生便決定請希特勒先生親自出馬。</p>
<p>方法是這樣，將舊的新聞片中，和日常報紙雜誌上有關他的照片，一一摘下，聚在一處，加些剪貼工夫，便已足够應付片中所需要希特勒的鏡頭了。</p>
<p>雖然希先生本人近來因但澤事件奔走很忙，無法分身到好萊塢前來拍戲，但是這麼一來，便等於他本人親上銀幕一樣。</p>

<p>徐碧雲觸犯梨園白虎之忌</p>
<p>他們族長所持的理由是，嫖賭抽三項雖然都是以耗材傷身，惟尚有急緩之分，內外之別，嫖賭是在家庭以外的，家長不易防範，况且鄉間的博　，不是押寶，就是牌九，修云「傾家的牌九，」　興一夜工夫就能把房地產全行輸掠，所以財的危險太大啦，至於嫖字，亦足以使人身敗名裂，若將娼婦討回家來，必致攪　全家不安，夫妻不和，雖然它的危險性比較賭博略少，然而一至狂嫖的程度，即一去無影無踪，人也看不見啦，應當辦理的事情也不能辦啦。因此三者比較起來，還是抽烟的一種嗜好，其危險性　而且小，他們都是有限制的吸食，旣不妨碍　子弟們分內應辦的事務，又自然而然的可以促令他們一到犯癮的時候，立刻就得奔回家來，决不敢在外邊有什麼趙　的舉動作了出來。再者若是已經上了烟癮，縱令讓他們去狂嫖濫賭，也是絕對不願去幹的了。孟氏的家規，旣是允許公開吸食鴉片，當然北平瑞蚨祥瑞麟祥這些祥子號裏和孟四爺住宅中都是時常設燈的啦　。碧雲一月之間，差不多有二十幾天會在孟家，年輕人能有把握的實在太少，有時候館子的戲唱完啦，覺得身體有些疲乏，偶爾抽他一筒兩筒，也還不覺怎樣，及至日子一長，可就離不開它了。唱且角多以色為重，他旣染了嗜好，扮相就一天比一天難看，碧雲不自檢點，髣　是自掘墳墓一般，也是他甘自　落的一個最大的原因。其次就是他倚伏他義父富於資財，復對他十分疼愛，故而他就任着性子胡作胡為，後來弄到犯了姦情案子，罰他幾個月的苦力，自此名譽掃地，作踐得不像個人形，雖是不久以後，孟四爺出錢將他保釋出來，但是短時期內他也不好意思再演戲了。—（五八）—</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Military news: Following the battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, the battle of Taihang Mountain has now begun. In the past month, the Japanese suffered heavy blows from the Chinese in western Shanxi and were defeated. Still unwilling to give up, they mobilized five regiments, totaling more than 100,000 troops from their original garrison in Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei, to launch a large-scale encirclement against the Chinese troops in the vast area of the Taihang Mountains. The Japanese army decided to invade in five routes. Among them, two forces invaded from north to south. One force started its southward invasion of Qinyuan from Pingyao on the 3rd. The Chinese army immediately launched an interception and annihilated more than 1,000 troops under the command of Japanese battalion commander Ganbigu in a battle south of Pingyao. Ganbigu was also killed by the Chinese in this battle. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese are still fighting south of Pingyao. Another force moved south from Pindin on the 5th, attacking Chinese-held Liaoxian. When the Japanese troops sneaked into Hanwang Town, south of Heshun, the Chinese army flanked the Japanese army from Yangcun, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. The Chinese army recaptured Liaoxian on the 7th. The Chinese and Japanese are now engaged in fierce fighting on the He-Liao Highway. As for the other two forces, they attacked from south to north. One force attacked Huixian from Xinxiang. When the Japanese troops sneaked into Huixian, the Chinese army had already made preparations and encircled them. Currently, the remnants of this force are still trapped in the Chinese army's encirclement. The Japanese army, feeling desperate, requested assistance from Xinxiang. Another force moved west from Xinxiang to support Boai. When the Japanese troops were moving from Xinxiang to Boai, the Chinese army seized the opportunity to ambush them halfway, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. However, fierce fighting is still ongoing. The Japanese army also invaded Xiaoweiying, south of Boai, on the 5th. The Chinese army gathered its forces north of the town and waited for the Japanese to sneak into the town before encircling them. In addition, there was another Japanese force attempting to sneak east from Yicheng to Qinshui and Yangcheng. The Chinese and Japanese are currently engaged in bloody battles in the area west of Qinshui. The above five Japanese forces have either been encircled or intercepted by the Chinese army, and their momentum has begun to weaken. (12th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesperson recently announced at an intelligence conference that the Chinese troops in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi are putting up the strongest resistance against the Japanese army. Since last month, the Japanese army has attempted to eliminate the Chinese guerrillas in northern Shanxi with four divisions and one mixed brigade, but the result was a complete failure. The Chinese army's strategy in the area is to attack individual Japanese units, and the mountainous terrain is extremely favorable to the Chinese. After the Japanese troops in Liaoxian were surrounded by the Chinese army, they have been completely reduced. The current focus of the battle is on the Datong-Puzhou Railway. (12th Hai Tong News Agency dispatch)</p>

At noon, the Japanese troops sneaked to the vicinity of Dongxi Bagou and were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. After six hours of bloody battle, the Japanese army failed to succeed and resorted to releasing poison gas to attempt another invasion. They were bravely repelled by the Chinese army.

<h3 id="e2">Strengthening the Control of Foreign Trade <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>According to the latest customs report, China's foreign trade in the first five months of this year had an import value of 56.8 million yuan and an export value of 24.3 million yuan. Compared with the import and export figures for the same period last year, both imports and exports have increased. The trade deficit was 22.5 million yuan, an increase of 10.2 million yuan compared with the same period last year, which is twice the total deficit for the entire year last year. In the past, China's trade deficits had a negative impact on China's economy. During the current war of resistance, the country's economic capabilities should be concentrated on various economic construction projects and the purchase of arms. However, the facts show that China still has to bear a huge expenditure on foreign trade, which cannot but be considered a waste.</p>
<p>When a country is at war with foreign countries, it always imposes extremely strict controls on foreign trade. Since the War of Resistance, China has also imposed controls on foreign trade, but they are not very strict, so they cannot produce the greatest effect. The reason why trade controls are not strict is not because it is factually impossible, but to preserve the rights and interests of European and American countries in China and not to make their business in China too affected. Therefore, the occupied areas can operate freely outside the jurisdiction of the Chinese government's laws and regulations; goods that are prohibited from foreign trade can continue to be imported into the interior; and the import of some non-essential goods cannot be prohibited. As a result, China's foreign trade has the largest amount in the occupied areas in terms of region, and Japan has become the leader in China's foreign trade in terms of country. These situations are not only detrimental to the wartime economy.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to adjust foreign trade, the Chinese government simultaneously promulgated three laws and regulations: Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods, Measures for Exchanging Foreign Exchange for Export Goods and Obtaining Exchange Rate Differences, and Rules for Applying for Foreign Exchange. The first law prohibits the import of all luxury goods and some non-essential goods; the second law encourages the export of local products; and the third law is a provision for the procedures for applying for foreign exchange. All import trade in the occupied areas cannot apply according to law. These three laws are all aimed at the current bad state; it is expected that they can achieve great results after implementation. As for the rights and interests of European and American countries in China that the Chinese government was concerned about in the past, they are now limited by facts and are under great pressure. It is no longer possible for China to make concessions, so it is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>China's wartime trade control can be said to have been considerably strengthened legally since the promulgation of the above three laws and regulations. However, in addition to the laws and regulations, it must be managed by a strict organization and supplemented by a definite policy to produce great effects. During the First World War, the most effective country in implementing trade control was Britain, and the most strict organization for trade control was also Britain. Under the Ministry of Commerce during the war, it set up various commodity committees to manage the import and export of various commodities; and it set up the Wartime Commerce Investigation Department and the Wartime Commerce Statistics Department, which specialized in investigating the business conditions of neutral countries. Its trade policy mostly adopted the method of agreed trade for various important commodities to prevent aiding the enemy. Judging from the situation of China's foreign trade in the past two years, there are many prohibited commodities that are still sold in markets everywhere in the interior; and China also has many raw materials that are still unreasonably exported. It can be seen that the control organization is not yet perfect. China's trade policy has recently adopted the method of barter trade, which is also a form of agreed trade, but this is limited to a few commodities. There is still a need to fully expand its scope in order to adjust the import and export of commodities and increase the amount of export trade. For example, after the implementation of barter trade, the amount of tea exported in recent years has greatly increased compared to before the war, which is a successful example.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese government should also pay special attention to the foreign trade in the occupied areas. Recently, the foreign trade in the occupied areas often accounts for more than 80% of the country's total trade. This is a huge economic force that cannot be ignored. Now the government only restricts the import of the occupied areas by applying for foreign exchange, but it can never prohibit the occupied areas from exchanging imports without exports. This is a serious wartime economic problem and a political problem parallel to military affairs!</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Japanese Cabinet Will Hold an Emergency Meeting Today to Decide on the Policy for Negotiations on the Tianjin Case; the Preliminary Talks Between Arita and Craigie Seem Likely to Be Cancelled; Negotiations Will Begin After a Date Is Set and Lists Are Exchanged; It Is Generally Expected That the Meeting Will Be Bleak and There Will Be No Good Results <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the upcoming Anglo-Japanese meeting, the Japanese government has agreed on the points of Japan's "unchanging attitude." It is reported that the Japanese government has decided to hold a special cabinet meeting tomorrow morning. After the cabinet meeting approves the various resolutions, Foreign Minister Arita will go to Hayama to ask the Emperor to approve Japan's policy. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the preliminary talks between Arita and British Ambassador Craigie will be cancelled. Arita will arrange a date to start the meeting with the British Ambassador and exchange lists of representatives. Then, all the representatives will immediately begin negotiations. "Negotiations on local incidents" does not seem to be the main point. General concern will focus on the negotiations between Arita and Craigie regarding Japan's demands. What Japan will demand is that Britain express its willingness to strictly adhere to neutrality in the war in China, and take this as a preliminary condition for starting concrete negotiations on the Tianjin case. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received journalists this morning, he declared that the agenda of the Anglo-Japanese meeting on the Tianjin incident must wait for the meeting between British Ambassador Sir Craigie and Foreign Minister Arita to be decided. The two will probably meet next week. It is expected that Foreign Minister Arita will demand that Britain first express its willingness to maintain strict neutrality in the Sino-Japanese War. The spokesman denied that the Japanese government was related to the anti-British movement currently being held throughout Japan. A reporter asked whether Japan was instigating the anti-British movement in the occupied areas in China. The spokesman replied, "This question is an insult." He also said that he had not received any information about various minor incidents, such as the recent incident in Qingdao where the British consulate was stoned. He also had no news to release about the recent situation of British military attaché to China, Major-General Spear. As for whether Japan had notified the British authorities in Beijing that it would organize a military court to try Spear and had invited British representatives to participate in the trial, he had not heard anything about it either. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that the Cabinet will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to decide on the policy for negotiations on the Tianjin case. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, another Chinese person was electrocuted and died on the barbed wire fence at the northern end of the British Concession. This is the third Chinese person who has been electrocuted and died after the Japanese officially announced that the barbed wire fence surrounding the British and French Concessions would be electrified. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese side has made thorough preparations for the negotiations on the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin issue. The military and diplomatic departments have drafted the necessary plans and can start negotiations at any time. It is reported that Foreign Minister Arita will ask British Ambassador to Japan Craigie to talk with him on Friday to determine the exact date for the start of the talks. Probably, the Anglo-Japanese parties may have a preliminary meeting before Kato and Matsudaira. If so, the formal meeting can probably open on Saturday. (12th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senior officials of the US government today expressed great concern about the changes in the Sino-Japanese situation in the past 48 hours, such as the crowd instigated by the Japanese throwing bricks at the British Consulate and the increasingly severe incident of the Japanese army blockading the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. All of this is clear evidence that the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo negotiations will not have any good results. At that time, the situation of foreigners in China will inevitably become more serious. At the same time, the news that the Japanese side will also raise the treaty rights of foreigners in China and other broader issues has aroused great attention here. However, US Secretary of State Hull recently declared that discussing broad issues will inevitably involve the United States. The US is also surprised that the Japanese side will try British military attaché Spear by military court, because Spear is a diplomat and enjoys the benefits of extraterritoriality. Therefore, the arrest of Spear is unprecedented among civilized countries. (12th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to sources from the British Embassy, the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo meeting will inevitably fall into a deadlock. On the one hand, the views of the two sides are too disparate. Britain is determined not to discuss any issues that will affect Britain's position in the Far East, but Japan very much hopes to discuss this issue. Therefore, even if the Anglo-Japanese parties are related to the issue of British aid to China, the issue of recognizing the New Order in East Asia, and the transfer of silver stored in banks in the British Concession in Tianjin to the Japanese side, conflicts between the Anglo-Japanese parties will still occur from time to time. Furthermore, after Guangzhou, Hankou, and Tianjin have fallen, and Shanghai has become an isolated island, Britain's position in the Far East will become more and more difficult. (12th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Times today carried a message from a diplomatic correspondent saying that if the Japanese Cabinet raises broader issues in the Tokyo talks than the Tianjin blockade, the negotiations will not succeed. The British government itself does not want to, and other countries will not allow the discussion of the more extensive demands made by the Japanese military for cooperation in its invasion of China. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to make the anti-British movement spread throughout the country, the two major political parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, have ordered their branches in various provinces, cities, and towns to organize anti-British conferences and pass resolutions urging the government to adopt a firm attitude in negotiations with Britain. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, Soviet Milkoff supplied two truckloads of milk to the British and French Concessions. However, the White Russian's continued transport of milk to the Concessions was stopped by Japanese sentries. Therefore, the preferential treatment given to Soviet Milkoff by the Japanese sentries is considered bizarre here. According to a Japanese military spokesman, the tense relationship between the Hankou French Concession authorities and the "Wuhan Special Municipality" has nothing to do with the situation in Tianjin. In other words, even if the Hankou French Concession is blockaded by the Japanese, it is another matter and will not have much impact on the resolution of the Tianjin issue.

<p>(Qingdao) The British authorities have issued a warning, advising Britons not to come to Qingdao for summer vacation for the time being. The warning has been notified to travel agencies and shipping companies in Shanghai and the Far East.

<p>(Chongqing) Dr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Executive Yuan, individually met with the general manager of the Hai Tong News Agency, Mestim, today. Mestim asked what attitude China would take towards the upcoming Anglo-Japanese meeting. Kong replied that if Britain yields to Japan's demands and retreats timidly, China will consider Britain's actions to have harmed its friendship with China. According to Kong's observation, the Anglo-Japanese meeting will focus on the disputes in Tianjin and will not be unlimited, involving general issues of the Far Eastern political situation. As for the Chinese government's conditions for a truce, the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in China must be a prerequisite. Only when Japan implements the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese territory will it be possible for China and Japan to hold negotiations. At that time, China is willing to participate whether a third country comes forward to organize a peace conference or an international conference is held. (12th Hai Tong News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party recently issued a special issue of its mouthpiece, the Xinhua Daily. The content roughly concerns the demand to resist to the end, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the necessity to oppose compromise and surrender, so as to realize the Three People's Principles advocated by Sun Yat-sen and establish an independent new China. The publication pays tribute to President Chiang, expresses deep gratitude to the soldiers fighting on the front lines and the powers aiding China. It then points out that after its military failures, Japan has had no choice but to engage in political activities. The publication also states that what China is currently experiencing is the oppression of Japan's political schemes and a Far Eastern Munich movement. Therefore, the urgent task at hand is to stop the development of these two. What we should pay special attention to is that compromise is tantamount to surrender and should never be lightly considered. The publication concludes with an appeal to the Chinese people and army to continue the resistance and concentrate the country's material and human resources to achieve final victory.

<h3 id="e13">The Japanese Army's Position in China is Becoming Increasingly Difficult. The Chinese Army Will Be Able to Launch a Large-Scale Counteroffensive After a Certain Period. <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) According to Chinese authorities in this city, the Japanese army's position in China is now becoming increasingly difficult. After a certain period, China will be able to launch a large-scale counteroffensive. Currently, the Japanese army only dares to rely on city walls or fortresses for protection and does not dare to venture a step outside the suburbs. Most railways are virtually useless due to guerrilla attacks. At the same time, after Chinese civilians evacuate cities garrisoned by Japanese troops, they are often subjected to relentless attacks by the Chinese army. The Chinese side is now adopting a new strategy of total and simultaneous counteroffensive on all fronts, causing the Japanese side to be stretched thin on all fronts and unable to reinforce one area by weakening another. Although the Japanese army is still superior to the Chinese army in terms of military equipment, it is inferior in terms of numbers. The biggest strategic error of the Japanese army is the excessive length of the front lines and the rear transportation lines, which has given the Chinese side the initiative in military operations. In addition, because the Chinese army has more troops than the Japanese army, the Chinese side can launch simultaneous counteroffensives on several fronts. (12th dispatch from Associated Press)</p>

<p>(Hankou) The cholera here is spreading rapidly. According to reports from this city, since July 1st, more than 170 people have been admitted to isolation hospitals, of whom 47 have died as a result. The spread of cholera is also related to the Japanese side's unwillingness to supply food and water to the refugee camps in the Wusheng Temple area. Because the refugees have no tap water, they can only draw contaminated water from wells and rivers for drinking. The Chinese newspapers controlled by the Japanese here still say that the relationship between the French Concession and the "Wuhan Special Municipality" remains tense. The "Wuhan Municipal Government" plans to blockade the French Concession and cut off the supply of food, drinking water, and electricity needed by the concession, urging it to open as soon as possible. Regarding the case of the arrest of members of the "Hua Zhong Youth Federation," it is reported that several members of the association and the five-colored flags they were holding were arrested and confiscated by the French Concession. The "Wuhan Municipal Government" is now demanding the release of the arrested personnel and the return of the flags. Although everything is silent now, this is only the calm before the storm.

It is also reported that after the above-mentioned new measures are implemented, the Japanese will exercise their right of inspection. (12th dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Soviet newspapers recently published unanimous articles commemorating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic. Pravda said, "Japan's lackeys are now rampant on the borders of the Mongolian People's Republic, but the Mongolian people remain calm and work hard to engage in creative work and improve the welfare of their motherland. The Mongolian people deeply know that their national defense is solid and challengers will get what they deserve. The guarantee of Mongolia is the close friendship between the Mongolian and Soviet people, which is sufficient to overcome any tests." (11th dispatch from TASS)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a spokesman for the "Manchukuo" government today, "Manchukuo" is prepared to negotiate border conflict incidents with the Soviet Union and is willing to accept any border demarcation proposals from the Mongolian side. The spokesman also stated that the "Manchukuo" government has strongly protested against the illegal border crossings by Mongolian and Soviet troops on two occasions, but the Outer Mongolian government has not only ignored them but has also made the same protest to the Japanese side. According to history and past administration, the Khalkhyn Gol River has always been the natural boundary line between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo." Now that Mongolia and the Soviet Union have crossed this boundary line, "Manchukuo" and Japan have no choice but to resort to self-defense. Finally, the spokesman hoped that peace would be seen in the border area as soon as possible. (12th dispatch from Associated Press)</p>
<p>Reuters Special Correspondent's Dispatch from the Manchukuo-Mongolian Front Line on the 12th: Since the war shows no sign of ending soon, both sides are sending reinforcements to the front lines. The Japanese side claims that the Soviet Air Force has been reinforced with the latest aircraft from Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. The reporter saw several Japanese 6-inch cannons and anti-aircraft guns today being transported to the artillery positions. Yesterday's Soviet air raid was apparently unexpected by the Japanese defense forces. The reporter witnessed two air battles. The first was launched by Soviet aircraft, using a feint to lure Japanese aircraft away from the Japanese water source, and then Soviet aircraft took the opportunity to bomb the Japanese water supply station. The Japanese pilots who participated in the battle with 24 Soviet aircraft yesterday admitted that the battle was the fiercest they had ever fought. Last night, the reporter met 16 Soviet prisoners captured the day before, all of whom were reserve soldiers from farmers in the woodworking areas of Siberia. According to them, they were called up on May 29, not knowing the reason and destination of the call-up, and went straight to the front to fight. They also said that under the fierce machine-gun fire of the Japanese army, the captain told them that resistance was futile, so he waved a white shirt and surrendered. The captain was seriously injured when he surrendered, and one of his legs was amputated this morning. The center of the fierce battles between the two sides is Nomonhan, which is just a sand dune, barren and uninhabited. The Mongolian side in the area also cannot control the higher areas. According to an officer commanding the Japanese army in the battle with the Mongolian army when interviewed by reporters, only a remnant of 200 Soviet troops remain guarding the east bank of the Khalkhyn Gol River. These people are now in a position of either death or surrender, because all the bridges across the river have been destroyed. The Japanese army has now seized the entire area in the middle of the Kherlen and Khalkhyn Gol rivers. The officer further stated that a small team of Soviet cavalry, assisted by tanks, crossed the Khalkhyn Gol River 18 miles north of the current battlefield, apparently in an attempt to contain the Japanese army, but most of the cavalry team has been driven back. The Japanese army is currently preparing to wipe out the remaining enemies. He believes that the entire area on the east bank of the Khalkhyn Gol River can be cleared of the "enemy" forces in a very short period of time. Although the exact strength of the Soviet army cannot be ascertained, it is reported from the prisoners that the 36th Siberian Rifle Division, the 4th Mechanized Brigade, and the Mongolian Cavalry are at the front. The reporter met with the commander of the Japanese front-line troops three miles from the front line, and the sound of their conversation was sometimes drowned out by heavy artillery fire. The commander said that the Soviet side might continue to bombard them to harass the Japanese army, but he would try to deal with this harassment.</p>

<p>(Moscow) A certain Japanese coal mining company on Sakhalin Island was fined 374,000 rubles by a Soviet court for failing to fulfill its contract with the Soviet trade union and providing Soviet workers with inferior food and clothing. The Japanese company immediately appealed, and today the High Court of Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinsky City on the island ruled to uphold the original verdict. Soviet newspapers recently commented that foreign concessionaires should take this ruling as a warning and be vigilant if they want to exploit Soviet workers. According to reports, Japanese Ambassador Tōgō Shigenori had talks with the authorities of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to intercede for the coal mining company, but to no avail. (11th dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Moscow) A dispatch from Vladivostok reports that the Japanese "North Sakhalin Mining Co., Ltd.," which enjoys a concession to mine coal in the Dué area of North Sakhalin Island, reduced its work from 1937 onwards, systematically making the living conditions of workers increasingly difficult, and violating the concession contract, illegally reducing workers' wages and food rations, causing significant losses to the workers and staff of the mine. Although the local coal miners' union mine committee repeatedly protested to the Japanese company, demanding that the workers' food ration quota be maintained, the results were ineffective. Therefore, a lawsuit was filed against the Japanese company, demanding compensation for the workers' losses totaling 375,000 rubles. After local people's judgment, the Japanese company was ordered to pay the full amount. Subsequently, the Japanese company appealed to the local provincial court, and the result was that the appeal was rejected and the original verdict was upheld. The above-mentioned judgment of the Soviet court is a serious warning to those who rashly hope to brazenly obliterate the legal rights of workers in the Soviet Union. (11th dispatch from TASS)</p>

<p>(London) In the British House of Commons today, Finance Minister Simon was asked whether the British government, in view of the resolute attacks on Chinese currency by the Japanese authorities, intends to find a way to maintain the stability of Chinese legal tender. Simon replied that such continued action is not currently under discussion. Labor Party Belenjer asked Simon whether he was confident that the equalization fund or the remaining equalization fund was still sufficient to maintain the stability of Chinese legal tender. Simon replied that, as he thought, this kind of question should best not be discussed in a question-and-answer format. Belenjer knew very well the British government's efforts regarding Chinese legal tender. Belenjer said that the reason why he asked this question was just to know whether the government's current intention was the same as when the bill was first proposed. I don't know if the House of Commons can hear this kind of guarantee. Simon replied that he thought his answer had addressed this matter, that is, the government is not currently discussing such continued action. (11th dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) Five representatives of the French Chamber of Deputies "Sino-French Committee" (composed of 348 members of various parties), arrived in London last night and met with members of the British Parliament this morning, such as Sir Milner of the Conservative Party, Mand of the Liberal Party, Baker of the Labor Party, and Badre of the Independent Party, to exchange views on the Far East issue and had lunch together. Afterwards, one of the French representatives, Socialist Deputy Moudet (former Minister of Colonies), issued a statement saying that their trip was to explain to British parliamentarians the need for organized collective security and resistance to aggression in the Far East. British opposition Labor Party member Baker said that the trip of the French deputies was of an informal nature. Some members of the British Parliament who were willing to discuss the Far East with the French deputies who knew about it invited them to come to consider various measures so that British and French parliamentarians could cooperate closely. In addition, some members of the House of Lords are scheduled to be invited by Lord Lytton (former chairman of the League of Nations Manchuria Investigation Team) to talk this afternoon to discuss the Far East issue.

<p>Vitoria: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to arrive here this afternoon from the port of Barcelona. Representatives of the Spanish Falangist Party's Blue Shirt Brigade, the Army, and the Italian Fascist Party headquarters all arrived here this morning to prepare for the welcome. A gate has been built outside the airport, and the national flags of Spain and Italy are hung. Shops and residences along the road where the welcoming procession passes are also fluttering with flags. After arriving here, Foreign Minister Ciano plans to travel by car to the Port of Santo Stos to meet with Nationalist Army leader General Franco. A grand welcoming ceremony was also prepared there yesterday. (12th dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures here recently commented on Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Spain, saying that Italy should do its best to urge Spain to adopt an "imperialist policy" and assist it, so as to be determined to recover British Gibraltar and French Morocco, and then formally make a request. Because the Spain ruled by General Franco occupies an important position in Italy's Mediterranean policy, Italy should promote diplomatic relations with it. Since Spain is ideologically related to the Axis powers, the foreign policy it pursues will inevitably run counter to the interests of Britain and France. A certain Fascist theorist said that if Italy can conclude an alliance treaty with Spain, it is the best way to shift the public's attention, promote attention to diplomacy, and maintain the rule of the Fascist Party. There is no doubt that Italy's diplomacy should grasp this goal. (12th dispatch from Havas)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, after the Soviet side put forward several new proposals on the 9th of this month, the British cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee discussed it today. Foreign Secretary Halifax also met with the French Ambassador to the UK, Corbin, to discuss the matter together. Political figures claimed that what Foreign Secretary Halifax and Ambassador Corbin discussed was the most important definition of "indirect aggression." According to news from Paris, the Soviet government hopes that a military agreement will be established first, and then a political agreement will be signed. It is a matter of course that the political agreement should be supplemented by a technical agreement, but the signing of a military agreement should not be a prerequisite. From this point of view, the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may not end for a while. (11th dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, a member asked about the progress of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that there had been some reports in the past two days, and there was nothing more to add at this time. Opposition Labor Party member Baker then spoke, saying that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union had been going on for three and a half months, and the Soviet government had at least shown sincerity at the beginning of the negotiations. It is unknown why it has been delayed until now without success. I hereby request the government to compile and publish the suggestions of both parties so that public opinion across the country can understand where the responsibility lies. Prime Minister Chamberlain then replied that all documents would naturally be published before the end of the negotiations, but publishing them at this time might cause criticism and would not be appropriate. Opposition Labor Party member McLean also transferred that if the negotiations had not been successful, who was to blame? We must allow public opinion to have a basis for judgment. The Prime Minister replied again, "When the negotiations are still in progress, it is inappropriate to calculate responsibility." (12th dispatch from Havas)</p>

<p>(New York) A comedy occurred at the amusement park of the World's Fair here last night, which almost caused a disaster. A certain couple planned to parachute from a 230-foot high tower, but in mid-air, their parachute got caught on a beam, and the couple was drifting in the air, unable to get down. They were 120 feet above the ground, and even the highest ladder could not rescue them. Curious people gathered around to watch, and more and more people gathered. Within a few minutes, the number reached as many as 20,000 people. Some people even took the opportunity to sell seats, asking for two US dollars per hour. There were also many searchlights that focused their light on the couple. At first, they tried to be humorous and waved to the crowd from time to time. However, they knew that they would not be able to come down for a long time, and they also glimpsed a huge ambulance for saving lives and helping the wounded parked nearby, so they were frightened and discouraged. Later, the World's Fair authorities mobilized all the police and firefighters to try to rescue them. After five hours, they were rescued, but they were already pale. (12th dispatch from Havas)</p>

The entire territory of the Free City is governed by Germany, while the Port of Danzig and the customs are jointly managed by Germany and Poland. This proposal is attached to the following conditions: (1) Poland should withdraw from the peace front led by Britain and France. (2) Poland should conclude a separate treaty of friendship with Germany to replace the Treaty of Non-Aggression of January 26, 1934 (which has been repealed by Germany). (3) Poland's surplus food should be re-imported into Germany. (4) The Free City of Danzig should be a demilitarized zone. (5) The system of the League of Nations governing the Free City of Danzig should be abolished, and the high commissioner sent by the League of Nations should be expelled.

<p>(London) Poles here claim that whether the Polish government will negotiate with Germany on the issue of the Free City of Danzig depends on whether Germany can first accept the following principle: that is, the Free City of Danzig must maintain its international nature and must not be incorporated into Germany under any circumstances. In addition, Polish Ambassador to the UK, Raczynski, recently returned to his country to report on his work and met with Polish President Mościcki and Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, and Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz.

It is heard that the Italian side says that this expulsion order is of a political and military nature. It is heard that two American citizens are not on the list of those to be expelled. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Italian government's order for foreigners to leave the Tyrol province, the Foreign Office has instructed the British Embassy in Italy to conduct an investigation. It is reported that 15 British citizens in the province have all received the order conveyed by Italian officials, but the reason is unknown even to these officials. At this moment, the British official attitude is completely silent, but leftists have already spoken of launching retaliation. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Britain, France, and Switzerland plan to protest to the Italian government regarding Italy's expulsion of foreigners from South Tyrol. It is heard that the British government has instructed the British ambassador to Rome to obtain the truth from the Italian government before lodging a protest with the Italian side. France and Switzerland have already lodged protests. Switzerland points out that this action by Italy has clearly violated the Italo-Swiss agreement. (Associated Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers have not mentioned a word about the order for foreigners to leave the Upper Adige region of Italy (including the Tyrol province and the Bolzano province). Foreign observers here have recently commented that the motive is of a military and economic nature. The Upper Adige region is an industrial center and a hub for important railway lines. In the event of war between the totalitarian states and the democracies, the Alps will become a battlefield, and the Upper Adige region will be at the forefront. Strategically, the relationship is extremely important. Now, it is said that Italy intends to make military preparations in this area and does not want foreigners to discover secrets, so there is the expulsion of foreigners. The fact that Italian newspapers have now begun an anti-espionage campaign seems to corroborate the above suspicions. A glimpse of how the Italian authorities view the evolution of the European situation can be seen here. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian government's order for foreigners to leave the two Tyrol provinces continues to be of concern to British public opinion, firstly because British subjects are also affected, and secondly because the Italian government's intention in this move remains unclear. A morning newspaper recently published a dispatch from Geneva stating that German troops are being moved along the Brenner Pass (the border between Germany and the Tyrol province of Italy). The Italian government does not want foreigners to discover secrets, so it has issued the expulsion order. Responsible individuals here say that this is speculation, and it is not yet possible to confirm it, but the government authorities have also imagined this possibility, so they are very concerned, not only because it involves British citizens. The British Embassy in Italy is continuing to conduct investigations in the hope of ascertaining the reason. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has appointed Paul Vories McNutt, High Commissioner to the Philippines, as Federal Security Administrator. Observers say that this appointment is of great political significance. McNutt's friends are strongly urging him to be a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1940. It is heard that President Roosevelt has promised that if he decides not to run for a third term, he will allow McNutt to continue his campaign for president. It is also said that if Roosevelt remains president and has McNutt as his vice president, it would be even more ideal. Several days ago, McNutt stated that if Roosevelt intends to run for re-election, he will definitely not contend for the Democratic presidential nomination in next year's election.

<h3 id="e40">US Neutrality Law Amendment Issue Postponed for Discussion: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Votes to Decide; Postponed for Reconsideration During Next Congressional Session; Pittman Proposes Ban on War Supplies to Japan <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee studied the neutrality law amendment issue on Thursday, and immediately decided by a vote of twelve to eleven to postpone the discussion until the next session of Congress. The committee has a total of twenty-three members. A few days ago, eleven members supported immediate discussion, ten members advocated postponement, and the remaining two members, independent Democratic Senators Gillette and George, had not yet decided their attitude. Until the last moment, they supported postponement. In addition, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, proposed banning the shipment of ammunition and metal mixtures to Japan. This case will be submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee for discussion on the 14th of this month. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided today by a vote of twelve to eleven to postpone consideration of the government's proposed neutrality bill until the next congressional session. This is a major blow to President Roosevelt, who hoped that Congress would resolve the neutrality issue during this session. The government originally intended to obtain the cancellation of the ban on arms exports to belligerent countries based on its proposed plan, and replace it with a cash-and-carry approach, so that Britain and France could benefit from it in the event of war. Now that this case has been resolved by the Foreign Relations Committee, it is heard that Democratic leader Senator Barkley will immediately propose in the Senate that if Barkley can get the Senate to approve his motion and remove the Foreign Relations Committee's responsibility to consider the neutrality bill, then the Senate can directly handle this case. After receiving the report from the Foreign Relations Committee that the case had been resolved, Secretary of State Hull immediately consulted with President Roosevelt on how to deal with the aftermath. After the meeting, Hull stated that for the sake of peace and security, the government will continue to advocate that Congress adopt the government's neutrality program. Senate Majority Leader Minton recently stated that President Roosevelt may force the neutrality bill to be handled without any decision from the Foreign Relations Committee. There are rumors of a special session of Congress being convened, because the development of world affairs may require the United States to decide on a neutrality approach before the next session of Congress. Judging from Secretary of State Hull's remarks, there will be a fierce battle in the Senate, because according to the opinions of government party leaders, the Bloom Bill passed by the House of Representatives has obtained sufficient votes to repeal the articles prohibiting arms exports. The government side still believes that the number of votes that the opposition in the Senate can recruit will definitely not exceed 35 to 40, so the government will definitely win a majority of the votes. The government side said that the opposition's attitude at a time when the European situation is so tense is tantamount to playing with fire. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) People here believe that the US Senate's rejection of discussing the Bloom Bill has dealt a serious blow to the British and French governments, who are trying to create a balance of power in Europe. Currently, British officials are unwilling to publicly express their opinions on the US neutrality case, but they deeply hope that the embargo articles can be abolished, and if this happens, the Rome-Berlin axis countries will face a major threat. (Associated Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Pittman Proposes Content of the Case</p>
<p>(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman announced today that he had submitted a joint resolution to the committee, advocating that the President be authorized to restrict foreign trade for any signatory country of the Nine-Power Treaty that discriminates against the United States. This kind of plan has been frequently discussed in all circles of Congress, and it is considered an economic measure to warn Japan against its activities in China. According to Pittman, the Foreign Relations Committee has agreed to consider this case at a special meeting convened on Friday. The purpose is to cut off the supply of war materials to Japan. The exports to be restricted or completely prohibited will include ammunition, war materials such as steel, gasoline, oil, scrap steel, and scrap iron. Pittman said that he is sure that there will be action on this case during the last session of Congress. Pittman was one of the senators who voted against postponing consideration of the government's proposed neutrality bill. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Roosevelt Will Send Message to Congress</p>
<p>(Washington) According to authoritative sources, President Roosevelt will send a message to Congress within a week, requesting that Congress must decide on the neutrality issue during this session. In this message, the President will use very strong language to ask Congress to abolish the clauses prohibiting the supply of arms to belligerent countries, and at the same time, he will emphasize the current international situation, state the basic principles of American foreign policy, and reiterate that the United States must morally use all means "decided on war" to help protect the independence and territorial integrity of small countries. It is heard that the nature of Roosevelt's message is roughly the same as the draft resolution proposed by Pittman to prohibit the supply of materials to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty. (Associated Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Washington) After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided to postpone discussion of the neutrality law amendment issue, Secretary of State Hull immediately visited President Roosevelt to discuss the matter, and then issued a statement to the press, saying, "I have previously proposed six points that I believe are necessary for the United States to defend its interests and maintain peace and security. These views have not changed from the beginning of the neutrality law issue to the present. The so-called six points are: one, restricting Americans from traveling to war zones; two, prohibiting American ships from entering these war zones; three, for goods shipped to belligerent countries, ownership should be transferred to foreign buyers before export; four, the current laws regarding cash or credit lending to belligerent countries should be maintained; five, regulations should be formulated for charitable donations for belligerent countries; six, the current inspection system for arms exports and the method of applying for import and export licenses for arms should continue to be implemented." In addition, when President Roosevelt met with reporters, when asked what he planned to do to get the Senate to continue discussing the neutrality law issue, the President refused to answer, only expressing his agreement with the statement made by Secretary of State Hull, and saying that among the six points, only one point is included in the current neutrality law. When asked when Congress would adjourn, the President also did not give a clear answer. Regarding this level, political figures explained that President Roosevelt at this moment may be in talks with the Democratic leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives, hoping to find a solution to the current situation. According to the President's intention, he may order the Senate and House of Representatives to continue to meet, even at the expense of offending the anger of the members. This level can be done simply by proposing other bills other than the neutrality law issue. People around the White House said that the President may order Congress to continue to meet for two months. During this period, if the European situation becomes tense, he will order them to discuss the neutrality law issue. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Political Figures Mostly Satisfied</p>
<p>(Washington) After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided to postpone discussion of the neutrality law amendment issue, political figures were generally satisfied. Although the opposition claimed that this was another setback for the government, those who supported the current foreign policy and hoped to abolish the arms embargo clause said that a majority of senators had decided to obstruct the establishment of the neutrality law amendment. Therefore, today, rather than immediately submitting the case to the Senate for discussion and ultimately failing, it is not yet known whether postponing the discussion will lead to favorable results. In particular, many of the President's advisors and senior officials of the State Department have said that it is advisable not to insist, so that public opinion can have ample time to study the situation and then express its attitude during the congressional recess. In short, apart from prohibiting the shipment of arms to belligerent countries, there is no clause in the current neutrality law that can protect American commerce and the lives of the American people in wartime. Not only is the government dissatisfied with this level, but even the isolationists who fear that the United States will be dragged into the whirlpool of war are also dissatisfied. In the end, they all agree that amendment is necessary. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>House Foreign Affairs Committee Changes Chairman</p>
<p>(Washington) After the death of House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman McReynolds, the vacancy has been filled by the election of Democratic Representative Bloom. This person has proposed the neutrality law amendment, advocated abolishing the arms embargo clause, and has always strongly supported President Roosevelt's policies. For several months, he has actually served as the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(London) Financial figures in London believe that in the past week the US treasury authorities allowing the price of foreign silver to fall is implemented in order to deal with Japan. This is said to be part of a plan of the democratic countries so Japan does not reap economic benefits from the British and American Aid to China campaign. According to news from the London financial world, the Chinese currency balance fund has been discontinued because Japan got more of the benefits than China did. The result was a major blow to Japan. (According to reports, the committee is mainly organized by the British.) It is said that the Japanese authorities, in the occupied area of North China, collect silver from the people, sold it to the London market according to the high price set by the United States. However, because Japan infringed on British and American interests in China, this aid to Japan has stopped being implemented. It is reported that this measure was decided to implement retaliation.

<h3 id="e44">Extending the War Against China, Japan Wants to Fight But Cannot; The Soviet Union Continues Construction, Currently Seeming to Have No Intention of Waging War <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>In the southwest of Heilongjiang province, bordering Outer Mongolia, there is a river of strategic importance that flows northwest into Lake Buir, the Khalkhyn Gol, with lush vegetation on both banks suitable for grazing. The Outer Mongolians were originally nomadic people who did not pay much attention to things like national borders. Seeing the good grass on the opposite bank, they drove their livestock across. Sadly, the few puppet soldiers on the opposite bank, under Japanese control, understood little about anything else, but they did have a slight understanding of the concept of border violations. Now that Outer Mongolians had entered, it seemed they should be driven out, and thus the conflict began.</p>
<p>Conflict Begins</p>
<p>Once there is conflict, there must be victory and defeat. The winning side takes advantage of the situation to pursue, and the losing side quickly reinforces. If Party A is thwarted by Party B's reinforcements, it will find a way to obtain reinforcements greater than Party B's to counterattack Party B. If Party B suffers a loss, it will also find a way to obtain even greater reinforcements to counterattack Party A. Thus, both sides continue to reinforce and counterattack. A minor conflict can easily lead to a large-scale war. Recently, Japanese wire reports stated that the Soviet Union had transferred 60,000 troops from the Lake Baikal region in Siberia to aid Outer Mongolia. The fact that the Japanese side released this news indicates that Japan will also send a corresponding or even larger number of reinforcements to deal with the Soviet Union. As a result, the war between the Soviet Union and Japan will become increasingly serious.</p>
<p>This is only in terms of the conflict in the Nomonhan area. We know that the border between Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia is not just along the Khalkhyn Gol, and in addition to this border between Manchukuo and Mongolia, there are endless borders between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo. When the Nomonhan War becomes intense, one side may use a feint to the east and attack in the west, suddenly attacking in another place where the two sides border, to contain the opponent's military strength and relieve the siege of Nomonhan. This is a very common strategy. In such a vast area like the border between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo, this strategy is even more useful and easy to implement. At that time, a formal war between the Soviet Union and Japan will also occur.</p>
<p>The question we want to study now is: Will the war between the Soviet Union and Japan break out because of this?</p>
<p>Japan's Plan</p>
<p>War between the Soviet Union and Japan will happen sooner or later. Not only do people in third countries say this, but the people of the Soviet Union and Japan also acknowledge it. Think about it: the Soviet Union has air force bases in its two strongholds in the Pacific, Vladivostok and Khabarovsk (formerly Nikolayevsk), and these two places are only 700 miles away from Tokyo and other industrial areas of Japan. This is something that Japan cannot ignore. According to its wishes, the Soviet Union's defense line should be moved westward, to west of Lake Baikal, so that the threat it faces would not be so unbearable. Its consistent policy has been moving in this direction. For example, in 1919, taking advantage of the Soviet Union's internal turmoil, it began to occupy the coastal provinces of Siberia, including Vladivostok, until 1923, when it was forced by the situation to return the occupied territories. Also, since the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan had already occupied the southern half of Sakhalin Island, which belonged to Russia, a region extremely rich in oil. However, after the outbreak of the European War, it then occupied the northern part of the peninsula, until 1925, when it was again forced to return it.</p>
<p>Japan's railway policy in Manchukuo even more clearly demonstrates Japan's ambition to drive Soviet forces west of Lake Baikal. After purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway from the Soviet Union, it began to add branch lines, two of which directly connected to the Soviet border, and one directly connected to Outer Mongolia. At the same time, it also opened new military ports in Korea, namely Seishin and Rason, with the aim that from then on, Japanese troops heading to northern Manchuria would not have to pass through Dalian and the South Manchuria Railway, shortening the journey by two or three days during transportation. This,</p>
<p>If we want to understand its intentions, we only need to compare the transportation situation of the Soviet Union in the Far East. The main transportation route of the Soviet Union in the Far East is naturally the Siberian Railway. That is a railway parallel to the Heilongjiang River, north of the Heilongjiang River, and very close to the Heilongjiang River. Once the Soviet-Japanese war breaks out, Japan can use the convenience of the new military ports and new railways to transport large troops to the Heilongjiang River in a short period of time, cutting off the Siberian Railway and preventing it from connecting east and west. Once this route is cut off, the Soviet Union will be unable to supply its troops in the Far East, and the garrisons in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk will be cut off from their rear lines. This is a fatal blow that Japan can inflict on the Soviet Union's Far East forces.</p>
<p>Soviet Countermeasures</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, seeing Japan's intentions, quickly launched countermeasures. What are the countermeasures? It is to build a parallel line to the Siberian Railway to the north of the Siberian Railway, starting from a town called Taishet located west of Lake Baikal, heading southeast, directly to Komsomolsk on the Pacific coast, which is another newly built town located north of Vladivostok. This newly built railway is also connected to the Siberian Railway in Khabarovsk. Khabarovsk is the location of the Soviet Union's Far East military headquarters, and the army's defenses are very tight. It is difficult for Japan to advance north from that place again and cut off the newly built railway. That railway is now mostly completed and will soon be open to traffic. With this preparation, the Soviet Union has nothing to fear even if Japan cuts off its Siberian Railway. Moreover, the Siberian Railway has now been laid with double tracks, and several important sections have even been laid with triple tracks. Seeing such arrangements by the Soviet Union and Japan, we know how deep their intentions are and how strict their war preparations are. However, the war between the two countries will definitely not happen at this time.</p>
<p>Japanese Concerns</p>
<p>From Japan's position, naturally, the earlier such a war breaks out, the better. Since the Great Revolution, the Soviet Union has completed two five-year plans one after another, and the third five-year plan is underway. The fourth and fifth five-year plans will definitely continue. Every year the war is delayed, the Soviet Union will have one more year to prepare. During this delay, Japan's preparations can also proceed simultaneously, but Japan's preparations have almost reached a saturation point and cannot advance at the same rate as the Soviet Union. Therefore, "doing it early" is actually beneficial to Japan. However, in reality, Japan's military operations in China are becoming increasingly rigid, and it will be impossible to end them without three to five years. When it thinks of this, it cannot help but make considerable concessions. Moreover, Japan started with "taking advantage of opportunities." In its war against China, it also initially wanted to "take advantage of opportunities," but because it did not have a thorough understanding of Chinese national consciousness, it backfired. Now, when dealing with the Soviet Union, it must not repeat the same mistake. What it considers "clever" is to start when the Soviet Union is busy with matters in Europe, so that it can achieve twice the result with half the effort. As for now, it will always be tough first. If toughness doesn't work, it will then "read the situation" itself.</p>
<p>Soviet Attitude</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union, now also seems to be a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan's involvement in China to launch a surprise attack and deliver a head-on blow, which will definitely put Japan to death. However, international entanglements are never so simple. In addition to its powerful enemy in the East, the Soviet Union also has a Hitler lurking behind it. It should be known that the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact is, frankly speaking, just a German-Japanese alliance against the Soviet Union. Moreover, Stalin is a very pragmatic politician. He is focusing on construction at home, and war and construction are difficult to reconcile. Construction can enhance the Soviet Union's status, while war will place the Soviet Union's national destiny in a precarious situation of uncertain success or failure. Comparing the two, it is naturally more prudent to remain calm and not lightly talk about war. Moreover, the Soviet Union's war against Japan is not a "healing war" but just a "preventive war." Since it is a "preventive war," it is always better to avoid it if possible. Moreover, now that China is at war with Japan, the Soviet Union does not have to come forward personally. It only needs to provide substantial assistance to China to weaken Japanese forces in the same period and achieve the effect of a "preventive war." Under such circumstances, why should it bother to step forward to fight?</p>
<p>Observing the Future</p>
<p>In short, Japan is currently unable to fight, and the Soviet Union's current position is that it can fight but has no intention to. But the result is the same by different routes, which can prevent a war between the Soviet Union and Japan from happening for the time being.</p>
<p>We believe that the outcome of Nomonhan will be similar to the outcome of Changkufeng. During the Changkufeng conflict, Japan claimed that Soviet troops had invaded the Manchukuo border, but the Soviet Union replied that its people went to that mountain every year at that time, indicating that it was Soviet territory. When Japan was tough, it later softened when the situation was unfavorable, allowing the Soviet people to continue "walking" on that mountain. Regarding the Nomonhan conflict, Japan again claimed that Outer Mongolian people had invaded the Manchukuo border. If the Emperor's spirit could drive the nomadic experts of Outer Mongolia from the east bank of the Khalkhyn Gol, that would be the best outcome. If not, when the time comes when they really cannot continue to fight, they will have to let these experts continue to graze there until winter arrives and the vegetation dries up.</p>
<h3 id="e45">The Dignity of Teachers in Guangxi <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<h3 id="e46">The Guangxi Provincial Government Orders Educational Institutions to Change the Term "Mr." to "Teacher" <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Guilin Correspondence. The saying of respecting teachers and valuing the Dao has been a kind of slogan in our country's Confucianism. Since the Zhou Dynasty, it has been followed by successive generations without change. After the Revolution of 1911, the dignity of teachers gradually declined. Students no longer knew how to respect their teachers. In recent times, scholars regarded the saying of respecting teachers and valuing the Dao as a product of the feudal era and even thought about breaking it down. Thus, the dignity of teachers was almost completely lost. The Guangxi Provincial Government authorities recently issued a circular, instructing all educational institutions and primary and secondary schools to require students in all schools to uniformly address educators or tutors as "Teacher" from now on. All institutions and organizations that appoint or hire educators must uniformly change the term to "Teacher." After the issuance of this order, the momentum of "Teacher"</p>
<p>was greatly enhanced. In the past, Confucius lectured at Nishan, with three thousand disciples, and later generations called him the First Teacher, without adding "old". Later, Xun Kuang, at the age of fifty, studied in Qi, advocated propriety and encouraged learning, clarifying the teachings of Zhou and Confucius. He served as libationer three times, and the scholars revered him. Therefore, the Historical Records of Xun Qing says, "During the time of King Xiang, Xun Qing was the most respected teacher." The name "Teacher" probably originated from this. The meaning is the most respected teacher in terms of seniority. During the Han Dynasty, Emperor Gaozu, who had seized the country on horseback, looked down on Confucianism, and the dignity of teachers also declined. Therefore, Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty began to write "On Teachers," and the dignity of teachers revived. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, students universally addressed their teachers as "Teacher". Students addressed their examiners as "Teacher," and students of prefectural and county schools addressed academic officials such as instructors and trainers as "Teacher". Today, primary school students universally address faculty and staff as "Mr." "Mr." means</p>
<p>"one who was born before me," which is also a title for those with virtue and seniority. Although the term cannot be regarded as completely wrong, it is far from the meaning that one must have a teacher to learn. The Guangxi authorities, because Chairman Chiang stressed the importance of respecting teachers and valuing the Dao at the Third National Education Conference, specifically issued this decree to ensure that the name matches the reality and to correct students' respectful address for teachers. The following is the text of the Guangxi Provincial Government's circular to all administrative regions, county governments, and educational institutions and organizations: (Title omitted) It has been found that students in secondary schools and elementary schools in this province, except for a few places that call them "Teacher," most places call them "Mr." According to the world, calling a teacher "Mr." is only because their virtue and learning are slightly better and they were born before me. In reality, there is a great discrepancy between the name and the reality.</p>
<p>If the name is not correct, how can the Dao be respected? It is understandable that the dignity of teachers has been taken lightly. However, according to ancient times, the dignity of teachers was extremely respected. It gradually declined during the Han and Wei Dynasties, and it worsened during the Tang Dynasty. Therefore, Han Yu wrote "On Teachers" to clarify the principle that one must have a teacher to learn. From then on, the world began to know to respect teachers again. For more than a thousand years since the Tang Dynasty, scholars in China have all known the dignity of teachers and have all known to call their teachers "Teacher." With the name being correct, teachers dare not belittle themselves, and students will also follow the rules and be respectful and reverent, without daring to overstep. Since the founding of the Republic of China, old systems have gradually been abolished, and new rules have not been established. In this transitional period, scholars despised feudalism, considering teachers as a product of feudalism and abolishing them. School students even regard teachers as</p>
<p>knowledge peddlers. Inside the classroom, there is a distinction between teacher and student, but outside the school gate, there is no difference between them and strangers. It has been a long time since teachers have viewed themselves as non-teachers and students have viewed themselves as non-students. If the teacher is not strict, the Dao will not be respected. If the Dao is not respected, the people will not know to respect learning. They are scattered and disorderly, indulgent and arrogant. To transform the people and establish customs, is it not difficult? The national crisis has reached this extreme, and the traces of cause and effect are not difficult to find. The lessons of the past are not far away, and the mistakes of the past can be avoided. The way to remedy this is to follow the instructions of the President at the Third National Education Conference, trace the roots and guide the origins,</p>
<p>and respect teachers and value the Dao. The term "Mr." should be changed to "Teacher" to show respect. Except for university teachers, who already have fixed titles such as professor, lecturer, and teacher, which will not be changed, all primary and secondary school teachers should be uniformly changed to "Teacher." All articles of association of secondary schools and elementary schools that have the word "educator" should be changed to "teacher." In the future, when appointing teachers to various schools, the appointment letters should use the word "teacher," and the principals of each school should instruct the students to call the teachers "Teacher." With this change, there will be a new look, and both teachers and students will be more conscious. Teachers will not lose their role as teachers, and students will not lose their role as students, so that teachers are strict and the Dao is respected, and the people know to respect learning. Transforming customs and educating the people will depend on this. The future of the country will be hopeful. This is ordered to be circulated to all to comply with.</p>

<p>Suzhou Correspondence. Recently, a large number of powerful Chinese troops have arrived in the four villages of Suzhou, and they are active everywhere, causing the Japanese army to be exhausted. On the 8th of this month, in one day, Chinese troops attacked the two key points of Taipingqiao and Baitaxiang in the suburbs, and both were victorious. It is reported that the Japanese puppet army suffered heavy losses, and the field hospital of the Japanese army in Suzhou has been filled. Therefore, the wounded puppet soldiers have been sent to various small hospitals in this county, which shows that the battles in the two places were very fierce. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Taipingqiao</p>
<p>Taipingqiao is located outside the Loumen gate of this county, controlling the throat of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway. This Chinese military counterattack was planned in advance. The area was originally stationed with more than 50 puppet pacification troops and 20 Japanese soldiers. When the Chinese troops attacked in two directions, the Japanese puppet troops collapsed and retreated into the city in less than an hour. Because it was very close to the city, the Chinese troops knew that the Japanese puppet troops would definitely make a comeback after retreating, so they completely destroyed the fortifications built by the Japanese puppet troops there, and set fire to many houses where the Japanese army was stationed. On the night of the 9th, at 2:00 AM, the Japanese puppet troops led a large force to attack. The Chinese troops ambushed in the hills, and when the advance troops of the Japanese puppet troops reached the vicinity of Yaojiajiao, the Chinese troops fired their guns, surrounding them from all sides. A fierce battle began and lasted until 3:00 PM. Except for those who escaped, the rest of the Japanese puppet troops were either wounded or killed. In this battle, the Chinese troops also lost one battalion commander and seven soldiers.</p>
<p>Baitaxiang</p>
<p>At dawn on the 9th, the Chinese mobile troops stationed in Taihu Lake suddenly advanced towards Musu Baitaxiang (the entrance to the Suzhou area of Taihu Lake). There was a puppet army district headquarters in the town. When the Chinese troops arrived in front of the puppet commander's gate, all the puppet soldiers were still sleeping. When the Chinese troops rushed into the puppet headquarters, they realized the change, but it was too late to resist. All the puppet soldiers were captured. The Chinese troops escorted a puppet company commander and three platoon leaders to a certain place, and then released all the rest after earnestly persuading them. In this battle, the Chinese troops did not lose a single soldier, and obtained a large number of rifles and one machine gun. This is an important achievement in recent months.</p>

<p>Xuzhou Correspondence. In the Tongshan, Xiaoxian, Peixian, Fengxian, and Dangshan areas of Xuzhou, the Chinese guerrilla forces are very well organized and constantly attack the Japanese army, posing a major threat. The previous day, Japanese cavalry with two trucks went to the Tongshan and Xiaoxian areas to search. When they passed Phoenix Mountain, they encountered the Xiaoxian Regular Army of the Chinese side and the ×th Route Army and engaged in battle. Li Ruichen, the company commander of the Regular Army, took the lead and was killed by a bullet in the abdomen. The Japanese army suffered more than 30 casualties. The Chinese army captured one machine gun and more than ten rifles. The Japanese army was defeated and fled back to the city. Zhang Lijun, the commander of the Tongshan Chinese Regular Army, led dozens of soldiers to dismantle the bridge between Sanbao and Caocun on the Jinpu Railway. A Japanese military vehicle heading north passed through the area and fell into the river, suffering heavy losses. The Xuhai Highway is also constantly damaged by the Chinese guerrilla forces. Therefore, more than 100 Japanese troops stationed in Pantang, the seventh district of Tongshan, were ordered to patrol back and forth in several cars. Once discovered, they forcibly conscript nearby civilians to build roads at any time. The 30 Japanese troops stationed in Yangzhuangji, the seventh district of Tongshan, were frightened and erected barbed wire fences around them for defense. They also forced resident He Yongzhi to organize a puppet maintenance association. Before three days had passed, He was captured by the Chinese Regular Army, severely punished, and ordered to report the movements of the Japanese army to the Chinese army from time to time to facilitate Chinese military operations. He was then released.</p>
<p>The Japanese army is now trying to recruit more than 1,000 bandits and puppet troops, giving them extremely strict training at Jiuli Mountain. These bandits and puppet troops, who were accustomed to being free and unrestrained, secretly contacted the Chinese ×th Route Army and suddenly revolted. More than a dozen Japanese officers who were training them were arrested, and more than ten rifles were captured. The Japanese army is suffering losses everywhere and has no way to solve the problem. Recently, they specially recruited a "Civil Corps" and planned to transport them to "Manchuria" for training. Anyone who recruits one person will receive a reward of three yuan. The residents saw through their tricks, and no one responded.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Pacific Typhoon Violently Lashes Shanghai Yesterday: Fierce Winds and Torrential Rains Arrive Like Mountains Overturning the Sea; Low-lying Areas Become a Vast Expanse Like a Water Kingdom <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The typhoon that originated in the Ryukyu Islands of the Pacific Ocean, touched Shanghai with its outer edge yesterday morning. It made landfall south of Shanghai in the afternoon. The fierceness of the wind was unprecedented in decades. From 8:00 AM yesterday to 5:00 PM in the evening, the wind had not subsided. Throughout the day, telephone and tram services were temporarily disrupted in some areas. Shop signs and roadside advertisements, as well as the glass windows of residents' homes, were damaged almost everywhere. According to reliable statistics, the losses from this disaster are no less than hundreds of thousands of yuan. Furthermore, the 50,000 refugees in the city, already displaced by war, were hit by this typhoon, making their situation truly pitiable.</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the first typhoon of the season reached northern China and approached Shanghai after noon, causing walls to collapse, roofs to be blown away, and many people to be injured. According to the Siccawei Observatory's noon report, the typhoon was estimated to pass west of Shanghai between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM. At that time, the typhoon's position was at 30.45 degrees north latitude and 122.30 degrees east longitude, within 15 miles. The wind was moving towards the northwest-west but showed a tendency to move north again. At 2:25 PM, traffic between Zhejiang Road and Yu Qiaqing Road on Nanjing Road was temporarily suspended due to fallen power lines blown down by the wind.</p>
<p>The Customs Office First Hoisted a Ball as a Warning</p>
<p>The typhoon that originated in the Ryukyu Islands of the Pacific Ocean developed to the point that, by 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, it was rapidly advancing towards the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, posing a significant threat to Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs immediately hoisted a black ball on the roof of the new Customs House on the Bund and on the lighthouse at the Customs Wharf on Weituoma Road (Yangshupu), and at night, replaced it with a red light to indicate that the typhoon might strike Shanghai, warning all kinds of ships to stop leaving port. Civilian ships and sailboats sailed to the waters off Lujiazui in Pudong to take shelter from the wind.</p>
<p>Fierce Winds Roared, Accompanied by Torrential Rain</p>
<p>At 6:00 AM yesterday, the typhoon had reached 30 degrees north latitude and 122.5 degrees east longitude, with the center of the wind force within a 30-nautical-mile radius, rapidly advancing in a northwest direction. According to reports, its location was east of the Zhoushan Islands, only 80 nautical miles from Shanghai, and the typhoon's outer edge had already touched Shanghai, causing fierce roars and torrential rain. The Customs Office again hoisted a black ball (making it two balls in total) on the roof and the Weituoma Road wharf, warning that the typhoon was attacking Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Situation on the Bund Was Alarming</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the situation on the Bund was extremely alarming. At the corner of Nanjing Road and the Bund, many rickshaws were overturned by the wind. Pedestrians leaned against walls to avoid the wind, and some who occasionally stepped away from the wall were blown over by the wind. At that time, the typhoon and rain were heavy, and the waves in the Huangpu River were high. All ships suspended their departure. When the wind and rain were fierce in the morning, the Huangpu River ferries also stopped running. By the afternoon, when the wind had subsided slightly, important ferries, such as those of the electricity company and waterworks, were still operating with difficulty to transport workers back and forth. As for the barges and sampans moored along the Yangjingbang and at the wharves from Beijing Road to the Bund, although they had strengthened their moorings in accordance with the Customs' warning, the wind and rain were fierce, and the waves were surging, causing them to collide with each other and become unable to withstand the conditions. Around 9:00 or 10:00 AM, some sampans were dragged ashore. It is estimated that as many as 37 were dragged to the south side of the Customs House inspection room, the riverbank of the Bund, and the floating bridges. Among them, one, No. 301, was dragged inside the fence of the Bund on Nanjing Road. According to the boatmen, about 20 or 30 boats were sunk by the waves. Most have sunk and been smashed, making it impossible to investigate. There are also six boats whose hulls have been smashed but have not sunk, drifting in the waterways of the wharves with the river water. Several barges were also damaged in collisions. All the boatmen on the damaged boats escaped safely, and fortunately, no one fell into the water. The plight of those in distress is very miserable.</p>
<p>The Wind Force Hitting Shanghai Reached Level Eleven</p>
<p>As the typhoon continued to advance rapidly in a northwest direction, the wind force hitting Shanghai reached a level of eleven around 11:00 AM. Then, between 12:00 PM and 2:30 PM, the typhoon began to make landfall about 30 nautical miles south of Shanghai. By 4:00 PM, the typhoon had reached 31.40 degrees north latitude and 121.40 degrees east longitude, west of Shanghai, with the center within 30 nautical miles, rapidly advancing to the northwest or directly north.</p>
<p>The Customs Office Still Lit a Red Light Last Night</p>
<p>By 5:00 PM, Shanghai was still being troubled by the tail of the typhoon, but the wind force had decreased to level five. At that time, the Jianghai Customs had not yet taken down the two black balls. After 6:00 PM, it changed to lighting a red light, indicating that the residual force of the typhoon was still present, sincerely warning ships to remain prohibited from sailing. It is expected that navigation will be permitted starting this morning. After the typhoon made landfall, its direction showed that it would sweep across the lower reaches of the Yangtze River last night and exit into the Yellow Sea.</p>
<p>Tram Services Disrupted, Shops Closed</p>
<p>The British and French Concessions, in order to prevent accidents due to the ravages of the typhoon and rain, specially ordered the Fire Department to dispatch fire engines and ambulances to patrol the area. Due to the scarcity of customers, most of the shops on the roads closed their doors. The number of passengers in the vehicles on the roads was also sparse. At 8:30 AM, the trolleybus line in front of the Slaughterhouse Company on Min Ti Ni Yin Road was destroyed by the wind, causing the trolleybuses to be unable to operate. More than a dozen were stopped at one time. It was not until a few hours later that repairs were completed and operations were restored.</p>
<p>Arrival and Departure of Ships Were Postponed</p>
<p>The ships that were scheduled to arrive yesterday, including the Tai Gu Bei Yang Ban's Shuntian, Jardine Matheson's Yisheng, Yihe from Beihe, the Japanese Changjiang Ban's Daikichi Maru, and the Dalian Steamship Company's Daisoku Maru, were all postponed. If the typhoon leaves Shanghai, they can arrive today. In addition, Jardine Matheson's Lisheng, which came to Shanghai from Qingdao, entered port at 5:00 AM yesterday morning before the typhoon arrived, so it was not affected. The Norddeutscher Lloyd's Gneisenau, originally scheduled to arrive on the 14th (tomorrow), is now sheltering in port and will be delayed by one day, arriving at 9:00 AM on the 15th. Passengers will disembark at the new Customs Wharf by tender at 10:30 AM. As for departures, the Taikoo Chengdu, which was bound for Hong Kong yesterday morning, anchored near Wusong to wait for the typhoon to pass before departing. Also, the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso, originally scheduled to set sail from Shanghai to return to Venice at 2:00 PM yesterday, was affected by the typhoon and will be delayed by one day, departing at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The passenger tender will depart from the new Customs Wharf at 12:00 PM at noon. The new ship Chizawa Maru of the Chia Hua Company will depart this afternoon according to schedule, heading to Xiamen and Hong Kong, and returning to Batavia via various ports in the Nanyang region. Due to the typhoon yesterday, passengers and cargo could not be loaded and unloaded, so it will be changed to tomorrow (the 14th) at 4:00 PM to set sail. The passenger tender will depart from the new Customs Wharf at 2:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. The Far East Company's Hana Maru, originally scheduled for its first voyage to Ningbo this morning, will now depart tomorrow morning. All ships traveling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River had no arrivals or departures yesterday.</p>
<p>A Vast Expanse, Water Reaching Knee-Deep</p>
<p>The city of Shanghai had cloudy skies and wind due to the typhoon the day before yesterday, but yesterday, heavy rain and storms began, leading to a lot of water accumulation on the roads. (French Concession) Yesterday, after the storm, the tide rose, and the bustling streets of the French Concession, from the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet to Rue Massenet, a distance of several hundred yards, as well as the intersections of Ximen Road, Rue Grolier, Rue Lupan, and Route des Soeurs, were transformed into a watery land. At the deepest points, the water reached knee-deep. Six parasol trees along Avenue Joffre were uprooted by the wind and fell to the side of the road. In the morning, the large glass window at the entrance of the Golden Grand Theatre was also blown off. The tin shed in front of Zhu Pinzhai at the Ningbo Road intersection and the power lines in front of the Slaughterhouse Company were also blown down, causing about sixteen or seventeen trams to be temporarily stopped there. (International Settlement) The intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, originally the center of the bustling city, was also a vast expanse. Sincere and Wing On were the first to be hit, and pedestrians were nowhere to be seen. Many of the large display windows of Wing On were shattered by the typhoon. The company temporarily nailed wooden boards to close the display windows, and it is said that the losses were very large. After 8:30 AM, the large billboard erected by the Wuzhou Pharmacy on Beijing Road was violently attacked by the wind and fell down along with the wall, injuring a rickshaw puller and damaging a car. From Daxin Street in the east to Yunnan Road in the west, all of Sima Road became a watery land. Most of the shops along the road temporarily built dikes at their entrances to prevent water from entering. Jishi Fei'er Road, Di Feng Road, and other places in western Shanghai were even several feet deep in water, invading the residents' homes.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Japanese Troops Cut Off the Riverbank of the British Factory, with Profound Significance, Even Threatening to Block the Entire Building; the British Protest Has Not Yet Received a Reply <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that yesterday (the 11th), regarding the matter of the Japanese troops in Zhabei erecting barbed wire to cut off the three British-owned factories on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, the British protest has not yet received a reply from the Japanese authorities. Although two of the factories were working yesterday, barbed wire was erected along the pier area in front of the factory buildings, making it uninhabitable. However, not far away, ships were loading cargo at the pier in front of a Japanese-owned yarn factory, where there was no sign of barbed wire. It is understood that the three factories are the China General Edison Company, the Zongxin Yarn Factory, and the Zhentai Yarn Factory. The British Consulate authorities protested because others were not allowed to go to the piers in front of the three factories. Official contacts began negotiations with the Japanese authorities on Sunday afternoon. According to the Japanese authorities, the isolation of the three factories had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that they were British-owned, but was part of the overall plan to isolate the entire north bank of the Suzhou Creek with barbed wire to prevent undesirable elements from crossing the river and infiltrating the western district of the International Settlement. However, the North-China Daily News reporter went to the China General Edison Company and the Zongxin Yarn Factory yesterday and found that the barbed wire currently erected only extended in front of the British properties to the point where there were no other factories beyond the British properties. Near the China General Edison Company, there is a large factory with a Japanese flag hanging on it, but so far, the factory has not been included in the overall plan to isolate the north bank of the Suzhou Creek with barbed wire. Yesterday, a member of one of the three factories commented on the situation, saying that this may be the Japanese authorities' plan to isolate the entire north bank of the Suzhou Creek with barbed wire, or it may not be a matter of discrimination against British factories, but the fact is that the erection of barbed wire is limited to British factories. For example, next to the British-owned Zongxin Yarn Factory is a Chinese factory (now operated by the Japanese). Although the Zongxin Yarn Factory has been isolated by barbed wire, the Japanese factory has not. If the Japanese want to isolate the north bank of the Suzhou Creek and erect barbed wire on the sides and backs of the factories, it cannot be stopped, because undesirable elements cannot enter the western district of the International Settlement. The Japanese can achieve their goals without inconveniencing the factory owners. This simple fact has been explained to the Japanese military. If the Japanese military ignores it, they will invite others to condemn their deliberate obstruction and interference with neutral rights. The land where they erected the barbed wire is British property and is recorded in the British land deeds. This is indeed another example of continuing interference in foreign commerce. At yesterday's reception for journalists, a Japanese army spokesman claimed that if the British continue to maintain their current attitude, the Japanese may need to tighten the relaxation of passage and residence for people of third countries in the occupied areas around Shanghai. Furthermore, the British attitude shows a lack of understanding of the situation. If the British try to investigate and cooperate, there will be less friction than there is now. This is not only the case in this example, but also in other examples. The Japanese believe that the British are currently abusing the relaxation given to them, which is not friendly to Japan. The Japanese may have to reconsider their policy toward third parties. The spokesman also replied to a reporter that barbed wire is currently only being erected in the most congested areas, but in the future, barbed wire will eventually be erected around all properties. When the Japanese army occupied Zhabei, the nature of the three factories in question was not determined. After investigation, it was proven that they were British-owned. Last November, at the request of the Zongxin Yarn Factory, the British authorities asked the Japanese to allow 40 Chinese workers to enter the factory to repair the machinery. The Japanese allowed it. On November 28, the Japanese agreed to the resumption of work at the two yarn factories, with five conditions: (1) Workers should enter the factory via Zhongshan Road or Route des Soeurs Bridge. (2) Employees must not go beyond the designated roads and yarn factory buildings. (3) The yarn factory must not build bridges over the Suzhou Creek, nor may it use boats to transport employees. (4) Employees must obtain a pass from the British Consulate General. (5) The agreement will be temporarily invalidated in the event of military needs or violations of the regulations by the yarn factory management. The spokesman continued that the British authorities had not responded to the Japanese proposal and had taken action without Japanese permission, using boats to transport employees across the Suzhou Creek, or allowing people who had committed crimes and carried weapons in the occupied areas to enter Zhabei. The Japanese had to prevent undesirable elements from infiltrating, so they erected barbed wire. This kind of secret communication must be stopped. The British protested against the erection of barbed wire as an unfriendly act and on the grounds that the Japanese rules could not be accepted because the factories had only just resumed work. The Japanese believe that they cannot agree.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Rumors of Changing the Status of the Northern District Denied by the British: Tokyo Talks Limited to Tianjin Issue, Changing Settlement Organization an International Matter <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that rumors that the Japanese were attempting to gain British support to change the Public Settlement district on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek into a Japanese settlement as a point of discussion for the Tokyo talks, which will begin soon, were firmly denied by responsible British figures in Shanghai yesterday (the 11th). Local officials, aware that these rumors were rife, specifically stated that the Tokyo talks were limited to the Tianjin issue and would not include any discussions on changing the status of the Northern District. In short, the United Kingdom is only one of the countries with a very important relationship with the Shanghai Public Settlement. This is an international issue and cannot be decided by any one country. It is heard that in Hongkou and the surrounding areas controlled by the Japanese, rent and land prices have soared recently, with land prices increasing by 400% compared to pre-war levels. The increase in house prices is also higher than the average increase in the de facto Public Settlement and the French Concession. This shows the ambitions of the Japanese, that is, Tokyo may exert pressure to force recognition of the establishment of settlements within the occupied areas. It is generally believed that the Japanese authorities have allowed dozens of European refugees to enter Hongkou in order to create an atmosphere of an international city in the area.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Datuan Briefly Recaptured: Chinese Troops Assist Guerrillas in Counterattack; Invading Japanese Troops Show Signs of Retreat <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese troops invaded Nanhui City and launched a full-scale attack from Xinchang and Zhuqiao. Unexpectedly, they were ambushed in the northwest rivers on both land and water, suffering heavy casualties. The first offensive failed, and the second wave of reinforcements advanced again, using four or five aircraft to bomb, dropping more than 20 bombs over Nancheng, destroying many civilian houses. In order to avoid direct sacrifice, the guerrillas abandoned Nancheng. After the Japanese troops from Zhuqiao entered the city, the troops from Xinchang bypassed and attacked Datuan. The old soldiers of Gu Lifeng's department of the Chinese side resisted this route and inflicted heavy damage, which was a great achievement. After the Japanese troops entered the town, they designated the Ni gentry ancestral hall garden as the guerrilla headquarters and set it on fire, causing heavy losses. Unexpectedly, after the guerrillas withdrawing from Nancheng and Datuan joined forces, they launched a counterattack against Datuan with fierce momentum. The Japanese were no match and were forced to withdraw. After the guerrillas recaptured Datuan, they captured Tao, the puppet "Chairman of the Datuan Maintenance Association," who had not had time to escape, and killed him with a large knife, greatly pleasing the people. Knowing that the Japanese troops would definitely launch another full-scale attack, they destroyed the important defense facilities of Datuan and withdrew to the east of Duangongtang. Sure enough, the Japanese and puppet troops searched and arrived in the town the day before yesterday. Because the people had all fled, it became a dead town. They urgently wanted to find a replacement for Tao's vacancy, but no one dared to take the position, so the order was chaotic and has not yet been restored. As for the main force of the guerrillas, they are now gathered in Fengxian County and Wanxiang Town on the Nanhui coast and have received assistance from most of the 45th Brigade. Since the day before yesterday, the suburbs of Nanhui Datuan have launched a fierce counterattack. The Japanese troops show signs of retreat, and there has also been fierce fighting in Fengxian.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Ministry of Finance Announces Withdrawal Methods: Pawnbroking Not Restricted; Speculative Businesses Lack Cash and Cannot Manipulate; Further Elimination of Exchange Rate Premiums Would Be Fatal <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnbroking Trade Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting it to forward an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Finance, asking for lenient handling of the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on withdrawal methods, which are affecting the industry. The reply telegram received stated that the pawnbroking industry is closely related to the livelihoods of ordinary people and should not be restricted in the use of deposits. In addition to sending a telegram to the Shanghai Banking Trade Association, you should immediately inform and notify.</p>
<p>Surplus Capital and Booming Speculation</p>
<p>Since capital from the war zone flowed into Shanghai, capital has gradually become abundant, and financial current deposits have surged. However, Shanghai lacks legitimate channels of use, and the internal transfer of capital to develop the southwest has not been fully utilized due to environmental factors. As a result, most of the capital has been transferred to speculative businesses, such as foreign exchange arbitrage, foreign currency, gold, stock trading, and even the hoarding of various commodities and the rental and construction of real estate and houses, which are more prosperous than before the war. This deformed development is not only detrimental to the stability of the Shanghai financial market but also inconsistent with the government's wartime financial policy.</p>
<p>Deformed State of Shanghai Trade</p>
<p>The deformed state of Shanghai's foreign trade is self-evident. The monthly trade situation this year has shown an increase in imports and a decrease in exports, with a growing cumulative trade deficit. The need for foreign exchange has been increasing. For example, in January, imports were 40,162,000 yuan, exports were 30,080,600 yuan, and the trade deficit was 9,356,000 yuan. In May, imports were 73,512,000 yuan, exports were 34,454,000 yuan, and the trade deficit was 39,058,000 yuan. The sharp increase in the trade deficit has set a new record for the Shanghai Customs after the war.</p>
<p>Curbing Speculation Improves Trade</p>
<p>The New Voice News reporter learned from various industries yesterday that after the Ministry of Finance issued measures prohibiting the import of goods and the rules for applying for import foreign exchange, the British HSBC Bank restricted foreign exchange swaps. All of these measures are to prevent speculators from manipulating and adjusting international trade. Therefore, the prices of gold, cotton cloth, flour, and other commodities in Shanghai's exchanges and black markets have gradually stabilized. Speculators lack cash and cannot manipulate any longer. However, it is hoped that further reduction of exchange rate premiums will be fatal to speculators.</p>

<p>Mr. Gao Huai de, courtesy name Xinshi, from Shanghai, is generous and righteous, and has always been enthusiastic about public welfare. However, since the war, he has been disheartened. In addition to contributing to refugee relief efforts, he has long been indifferent to social events and is engaged in business and operating the Lido Garden and presiding over the Lido Sports Association. Recently, he was falsely accused of being suspected of being a guerrilla. The investigation has now been completed and found that there is no suspicion. He was released yesterday (the 12th). Gao's relatives and friends have sent their condolences. According to Gao's associates, after this stimulation, Gao will not participate in any social events and will focus on continuing his past business.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the third day of the Health Education Campaign Publicity Week organized by the YMCA. After Chairman Xu Xiaochu reported the significance of the conference, Gu Douyan gave a lecture on children's health, followed by a table tennis performance, egg-holding competition, group games, ordinary family nursing methods, and two films on bacteria. Each radio station also continued to broadcast programs. Yesterday, the French Concession Health Department again advised citizens to kill flies in an article titled "War on Flies." Dirty people are always followed by flies in all climates. Flies use unclean items as food in all climates. Unclean objects are the most dangerous breeding grounds for disease-causing bacteria. Flies are covered in bristles and have small racket-like devices on their feet, so they carry various pathogens. They transmit infections everywhere they land. The bacteria they swallow are excreted in their feces, which are even more toxic. Therefore, we should fight against flies. Those who can be defeated by flies are those who are clean. Keep your house and its surroundings clean. Do not let food scraps or any garbage be scattered. Do not allow flies to come into contact with human excrement.</p>

<p>Spring Cocoons from Eastern Zhejiang Are Allowed to Be Transported to Shanghai; Foreign Exchange to Be Settled According to Posted Rates; Puppet "Central China Company" Allows Zhejiang Cocoons to Be Transported to Shanghai; First Batch of Over a Thousand Packages Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned from silk factories that silk factories within the Shanghai settlement area, due to a lack of raw materials, had petitioned the Zhejiang Provincial Government through the industry association, requesting permission for spring cocoons from Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Xinchang, Sheng County, and other places in eastern Zhejiang to be shipped to Shanghai by ship from Ningbo to provide assistance. It was also agreed to sell foreign exchange to the government in accordance with the posted rates of the Bank of China and the Central Bank, in accordance with the methods for re-exporting local products to the occupied areas. After negotiations between the provincial authorities and the Trade Commission, it was heard that the transportation of spring cocoons from eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai has been permitted, but foreign exchange must be sold to the government in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Zhejiang Spring Cocoons Released for Transport to Shanghai <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The cocoons obtained by the silk factories in the Shanghai settlement area from the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, (1) 16,000 dan of dry cocoons from Zhejiang and (2) 20,000 pieces of dry cocoons from Jiangsu, were successively obstructed from being transported to Shanghai by the "Central China Silk Company" under the guise of control. After repeated negotiations by the factory, "the company" put forward harsh conditions, causing the factories in Shanghai to be forced to completely shut down. It is heard that the Zhejiang cocoons have now been negotiated and the manufacturers are allowed to transport them to Shanghai for reeling. The first batch is from the Lamping Juxing cocoon bank, totaling 1,150 packages, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday by the Shanghai-Hangzhou train. The cocoons from Jiangsu that have been blocked have not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Settlement Factories Prepare to Resume Operations</p>
<p>There are a total of 46 silk reeling factories in the settlement. Previously, they were forced to shut down due to the exhaustion of raw materials. Now that the Zhejiang spring cocoons have been released for transport to Shanghai, they have begun to repair their machinery and prepare to resume work. The cocoons from Jiangsu Province have not been resolved, so it is temporarily impossible to transport them to Shanghai. It is heard that the manufacturers have requested that they be handled in accordance with the Zhejiang method. After the "Central China Cocoon Silk Company" allows it, they can also be transported to Shanghai in batches by train. It is also heard that the manufacturers have suffered losses due to the sudden obstruction of the transport of the cocoons they obtained, but they can only bear with it under the influence of power. However, future purchases from the occupied areas will be regarded with caution.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Using Fishermen to Probe Military Intelligence, Coastal Smuggling is Rampant: Fake "City Government" Issues Sea Passes, Fishermen are Used to Sell Inferior Goods <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram from the Eighth District National Self-Defense Corps of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the fake regime, in order to increase tax revenue, dump inferior goods, and facilitate the probing of our military intelligence, ordered the fake "Shanghai City Government" to produce and issue sea passes to solicit coastal fishing boats to obtain them. Each pass costs more than ten yuan. The ships that obtain the passes mostly carry inferior goods that have been repackaged and transported to various ports for sale. In addition, they also probe military intelligence each time. The fake regime also occasionally shows small favors to make them grateful. If they encounter military interrogation, they insert the passes into firewood. The method is to split the firewood into two pieces, insert the pass, and then reassemble them into one, mixing them into the firewood. The military police cannot detect them, and they are able to enter the port and land safely time and time again. This practice is prevalent in Taizhou and Jinqing Port areas, so many of the fishermen in that area have been invisibly used by the fake regime. The coast of Wenzhou also shows the same trend. If it is not prevented in advance, the impact on the future of the war of resistance will be significant. After receiving the report, the provincial government believed that the matter was a certain conspiracy and telegraphed the Wenzhou and Taizhou defense commanders, the Sixth District Administrative Inspector Commissioner, and the county magistrates of Zhenhai, Yin County, Cixi, Xiangshan, Ninghai, Fenghua, Huangyan, and Yuyao counties to strictly prevent it to avoid future troubles. It is also reported that the smuggled goods imported are mostly cloth and cigarettes, and the goods leaked to the sea are mainly rice, firewood, tung oil, and tea.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Celebrations by Various Concession Police Stations for French National Day <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the 150th anniversary of the French Democratic Revolution. The French expatriates and authorities in this city will follow the usual practice and hold a warm celebration, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the French Concession's Grande Horloge, McLane Police Station, Songshan Road Police Station, Lujiawan Police Station, and the entrances of various fire brigades have been ordered to install tricolor light bulbs and French flags in front of the doors, and decorate them with pine and cypress. They will be brightly lit in the evening to celebrate. At 7:30 tomorrow morning, all French Concession police, French army, navy, volunteer teams, etc. will line up in the Gujiazhai Garden on Hualong Road, where they will be inspected by the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, and the French Consul General in Shanghai, Baudic. A flag-raising ceremony will also be held. This year, the French authorities, like in previous years, do not intend to issue invitations separately. The Gujiazhai Garden will be closed all day tomorrow for military review purposes. Residents and shops in the French Concession may hang flags to celebrate the French Republic Day. In the evening, Ambassador Cosme will host a banquet at the French Chamber of Commerce on Hualong Road for French army and navy officers and senior police officers in Shanghai, where there will be music and dance to add to the fun. The lantern parade, like last year, will be suspended. The French police will, as usual, promote meritorious personnel on this day to show encouragement. French warships in the Huangpu River will also fly flags to celebrate the National Day.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Rice Prices Plummet, Retail Prices Still Follow Price Limits, Authorities Should Increase Supervision <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>In the past two or three days, rice prices have plummeted by about one yuan. Medium-grade goods have fallen by more than two yuan compared to the highest price, which can reflect the substantial inventory and the stability of the public's mind. However, although the prices in the rice market have fallen, most retail rice shops still sell at the limited price. It is hoped that the authorities will further lower the rice price and revise the limited price, so that the small people and the entire people's food supply will benefit greatly. According to the statistical table of the rice industry over the years, from 1864 to 1911, the highest selling price of one picul of japonica rice ranged from three yuan to seven yuan. In 1912, it rose to nine yuan, in 1920 to thirteen yuan, in 1925 to eighteen yuan, and in 1930 to twenty-three yuan. The limited price in 1930 was 21 yuan per picul. Although the current limited price is nominally the same as in 1930, due to changes in the market system, the current one picul of rice is only 85% of one picul in 1930. According to this calculation, the current limited price is actually equal to 24 yuan per picul in 1930.</p>

<p>Regarding the transport of summer cloth from Jiangxi Province to Shanghai, the local summer cloth industry previously telegraphed the Zhejiang Maritime Customs Commissioner to inquire whether there was an order to release it. Now, a reply telegram has been received stating that regarding the transport of summer cloth left in Ningbo by the Jiangxi merchants to Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance has ordered that within the limit of 300,000 yuan, they are allowed to be exempted from the domestic sales special permit. The merchants should apply to the official office at the place of departure for a certificate proving that it is indeed for domestic sales, and present it to the customs for verification and release without settling foreign exchange and collecting taxes.</p>

It is hoped that colleagues in the banking industry and people from all walks of life will take advantage of these last two days to go and purchase more, both to benefit the victims and to obtain exquisite American goods.</p>

Those who evade the transit procedures and export privately will be fined up to 500 yuan in accordance with the regulations. It is urgent to announce the format of the transit application form to let everyone know and follow it.</p>

<p>The Production and Construction Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Rehabilitation Office pays close attention to the production and construction of refugees. The group has now re-formulated the following plan for establishing a civilian construction factory: (1) The crafts taught in the carpentry factory should establish the following five principles: A. The raw materials are convenient to obtain and do not require huge capital; B. The manufactured products are daily necessities and can be sold at any time; C. The equipment is simple and does not require huge machines, or can be used manually and semi-mechanically; D. After the civilians have learned, they can operate independently and be able to engage in sideline occupations in their spare time; E. After the civilians have learned, the job prospects are easy and urgently needed by all parties. (2) The workshops that should be set up in this factory, according to the above principles, should first handle the following types: A. Toy industry; B. Rattan, bamboo, and grass weaving industry; C. Woodware industry; D. Machine tools; E. Lace sewing industry; F. Towel weaving industry; G. Other daily necessities industries. (3) For the above-mentioned industries, the association will contact and cooperate with factories that have achieved significant results. All factory buildings will be provided by the association. The skill transfer and product promotion will be the responsibility of each factory. The work performance, character training, food, lodging, and management will be the responsibility of the association's factory director. If each factory needs the association's financial assistance for equipment and raw materials, it can be provided with loan facilities. The loan measures will be formulated separately. (4) The workers of the association's civilian construction factory will be selected from the refugees in each shelter who volunteer to learn the crafts and sent to work separately. After the skills are mature, wages will be given on a daily basis as an encouragement. If permitted by the supervisors of each workshop, they can also be introduced to suitable jobs. (5) The association's factory may add or change workshops at any time to adapt to the environment in order to meet social needs.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Various Industries Send Personnel to Northern Jiangsu to Purchase Various Foods <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Daily foods in this city, such as chickens, ducks, eggs, fish, and vegetables, have always relied on the supply from northern Jiangsu, eastern Zhejiang, and the four suburbs of Shanghai. Since the inland river and port shipping are controlled by Japanese merchants, passenger and freight traffic has been declining. Although shipping in eastern Zhejiang has been indirectly resumed between Shanghai and Ningbo, freight transport has not yet been smooth. Therefore, there is still a shortage of supply in the market. It is learned that various industries have now sent personnel to various parts of northern Jiangsu to purchase various goods, and will hire special ships to transport them to Shanghai in a steady stream to meet the needs and stabilize the prices of various goods.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Fierce Battle in Yuhuan: Japanese Troops Driven Back to Ships; Japanese Navy's Attempt to Land Through the Mountains Failed; Japanese Warships Did Not Withdraw, Chinese Troops are on High Alert <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>According to news received by the shipping industry yesterday afternoon: (1) Five Japanese warships arrived in the Chuanshan waters on the morning of the 11th and bombarded the shore. Then, more than ten speedboats were lowered, full of armed Japanese soldiers, and attempted to land under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese army responded calmly, and the Japanese army failed. Since the Japanese army landed in Dinghai, Chuanshan and Dinghai are only separated by water. The Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities had already dispatched heavy troops to guard the area, and the defense was very solid. (2) On the 11th, the Japanese army once again attempted to land in Yuhuan outside Wenzhou. The Chinese army's position was destroyed by intense artillery fire, causing the Japanese army to land. Then, the Chinese army's fresh troops arrived and launched a counterattack. Thanks to the soldiers' dedication, the Japanese army was driven back to the ships. Currently, there are still six Japanese warships anchored in the waters around Yuhuan in Wenzhou, and it seems that they are continuing to attempt something. The Chinese army is on high alert.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Japan Plans to Blockade Southern Fujian, Notifies Foreign Merchant Ships, Warships, and Nationals to Withdraw; Chinese Army Positions in Chaozhou and Shantou Will Not Be Affected <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that according to reliable sources in this city, the Japanese Navy will begin military operations in Quanzhou, Tongshan, and Zhao'an in southern Fujian within a few days in order to intensify the blockade of the Chinese coast. It is heard that the Japanese Navy has notified the intention to third countries and asked them to order their merchant ships and warships to leave these ports, and stated that the Japanese authorities will not be responsible for any direct or indirect losses suffered by ships left in the three ports after the start of military operations, and also asked third-country nationals residing in these areas to withdraw as soon as possible. It said that the entrances to the three ports were involved in military operations and would be blocked with obstacles and dangerous materials. After that, ships would not be able to enter or leave the three ports. The obstacles and dangerous materials in Quanzhou, which is not far from Xiamen, will be placed on the line connecting Chongwu Lighthouse and Xiangzhixiao. The public is afraid that the blockade of the port will greatly affect the residents of Gulangyu, because the small island obtains food supplies from the Fujian mainland, which will become more difficult. The obstacles and dangerous materials in Tongshan, south of Quanzhou, will be placed near the mouth of Tongshan Bay, that is, near the east-west line passing through Guleitou Mountain. It is believed that the Japanese Navy does not intend to send marines to the above-mentioned two ports, except for Zhao'an. The Japanese army may launch a land war in Zhao'an for military reasons, so as to encircle the Chinese army around Shantou and Chaozhou. These three ports have no highways or railways connected to the interior, so the Japanese blockade will not greatly affect the Chinese positions. Among the three ports, only Quanzhou is slightly more important in commerce.</p>

The police chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to go together and arrested Mr. A on the spot. After a detailed inquiry by the French police, he was handed over to the detectives of the Central Police Station of the Public Concession to be taken away. However, it is not known whether Mr. A is still in the Central Police Station or has been extradited to the Japanese.</p>

<p>The supply of fresh pork and chicken in this city has always relied on Taizhou, Jingjiang, Rugao, and other places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River as the only source. Recently, due to the continuous occurrence of wars in the territory of Taijing and Rugao, the situation is chaotic and transportation is obstructed, resulting in a great impact on the source of fresh pork, chicken, duck and other livestock, and the arrival of goods is reduced. Those who are in the Japanese military occupied areas are all taken by the Hongkou pseudo "Livestock Market" by special forces and transported to Hongkou by Japanese ships for slaughter. Sales are limited to one area. Therefore, in the Public Concession and the French Concession, the supply and demand of fresh pork, chicken, duck and other meats are insufficient, and only a small amount is available for the market. The selling price has increased by 10% to 20% to 30% compared to before. Meat eaters in Shanghai are affected considerably, and there are quite a few who give up meat and eat vegetarian food.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Health Office of the French Concession printed a leaflet titled "Your Body" in Chinese, French, English, Russian and other languages, and distributed it to various households, saying that carelessness in your food can cause many serious diseases. Diarrhea, typhoid fever, cholera, cholera are diseases of the digestive organs, so anything that disrupts the normal functioning of the digestive organs can easily help the activity of bacteria and stimulate the growth of cholera in the body. Therefore, in the face of epidemic threats, strict dietary hygiene is necessary. Pay attention to your water, boil it, pay attention to the cleanliness of the water containers, do not drink too much or too cold liquids, because it can reduce the antitoxic power of gastric secretion. Do not eat raw vegetables or raw fruits that have not been disinfected for a long time in potassium permanganate compound liquid. Be careful with fruits, do not eat sliced ​​fruits for sale, and do not eat food that has been cooked for too long, it is even more inappropriate if the items have rotted. Pay attention to cleanliness, pay attention to your servants, make them wash their hands frequently with soap, this is the insurance for your own body, pay attention to the cleanliness of your house and surroundings, because all kinds of remnants are conducive to the breeding of flies, and flies can transport cholera bacteria everywhere. Be sure to inject cholera prevention needles. The Health Education Movement Propaganda Week, sponsored by the Health Movement Youth Association, was the second day of the conference yesterday. About 1,000 people came to the meeting. At 7 o'clock, the chairman Xu Guanqun led the salute, and then reported that the city is prone to disease transmission due to the concentration of population. Since the Shanghai War, the population has increased sharply, reaching 5 million. According to the statistics of the health offices of the two concessions, the mortality rate has also increased by 16% to 17%. Diseases not only cause mental suffering, but also cause significant material losses. Therefore, if we want to avoid the danger of disease and death, we should first pay attention to the hygiene of daily life. The meaning of the Youth Association's launch of this meeting lies in this. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will widely promote it so that citizens can live a long life. Then, Qi Dazhi gave a lecture on summer diseases and their prevention, followed by two films on food and growth, beverages and water, and foot sound dance, wrestling, sword dance, rope skipping performance, placing oneself in the position of another, funny singing, three-legged race, group swimming, lame blind run, pushcart race, travel, and other recreational activities. At the same time, the radio broadcast started yesterday. The association has divided the program and added simple and easy-to-understand health education materials when switching programs at various Chinese commercial radio stations in the city, including Zhongxi, Dalu, Daya, Huamei, Guohua, Tianchan, Foyin, and Lishude Hall, and widely promoted it so that all citizens can listen to it and achieve twice the result with half the effort. On the one hand, ten microscopes with 300 times magnification were displayed in Xue Gengtang on the second floor, with fly feet, mosquito proboscis, bed bug mouths, bacteria and the like placed under the microscope. The slightest detail is almost like a fountain pen when viewed in the microscope. The shape of infectious disease is frightening and gives visitors a deep impression, and they realize the importance of health, which is of great importance to life.

<p>The China Press reported that, according to a private letter disclosed by a foreigner here yesterday (the 10th), the labor shortage in Japan has reached an acute state, and women and children are even forced to engage in the most difficult manual labor for more than 24 hours. The letter was sent by an American woman who returned to the United States last month on the Russian Empress. On June 26, the ship began loading coal in Nagasaki. Obviously due to the labor shortage, a group of coal loaders were all women and children under the age of fifteen. Traditionally, the loading of coal takes up to five and a half hours, but these women and children were forced to load coal for 24 and a half hours. When they finished loading, they were so exhausted that they could be said to have collapsed in the barge.</p>

<p>As the war moved west, the towel factories in Chuansha, Baoshan, Jiading and other counties successively tried to relocate to Shanghai to resume production, totaling no less than 20. All the female workers were residents from Chuansha, Jiading and other counties who came to Shanghai to take refuge, and the number reached more than 1,000. Recently, prices have soared, and factories cannot maintain their operations. Except for several new factories, such as Xinxing, Yongmao, and Mingchang, which have now closed down, the remaining factories are also returning to their hometowns one after another. Therefore, the number of unemployed female workers is increasing day by day. It is learned that Dahua Towel Factory, located at No. 67 and 68, Ciyou Road, Xujiahui (west of the Observatory), is trying to expand and can accommodate dozens of people. Any unemployed female workers who want to work in the factory can go to register.</p>

<p>The China Press reported that the news that a large group of anti-British protesters in Qingdao threw stones at the British Consulate and seven British businesses reached Shanghai yesterday (the 11th). The British expatriates in this city are deeply resentful. Most British expatriates and foreigners were talking about the Qingdao incident last night. Whenever British expatriates gathered in one place, they immediately discussed the Qingdao incident.</p>
<p>Japanese Actually Tried British Military Attaché</p>
<p>In addition, it was reported yesterday that the Japanese military authorities in North China announced that they would open a special Japanese military court in Zhangjiakou to try British Army Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Spear, which further increased the anger of the British expatriates. Last night, Shanghai received news from Qingdao that the city was still calm after the incident that occurred there two days ago.</p>
<p>British Warship Sailors Rumored to Have Landed It is rumored that sailors from warships have landed, but this statement could not be definitively confirmed in this city last night. The British Naval Office in Shanghai announced yesterday that the British warship Duchess or Duchess will leave Shanghai for Weihaiwei today (the 12th), and said that the trip has no special significance, but observers believe that the ship's trip is related to the anti-British activities in Qingdao.</p>
<p>Seven British Businesses Similarly Humiliated</p>
<p>Also, according to private sources here last night, the windows on the front entrance of the HSBC Bank in Qingdao were smashed by anti-British protesters during the Qingdao incident on Sunday. HSBC Bank was one of the seven British shops that were attacked by stones thrown by the protesters after they left the British Consulate. Reuters reported from this question yesterday morning that two British banks had been attacked with stones, but the report did not name the banks. It is believed that the other bank is the office of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Sir Sassoon Purchased, the "Iron Lung" Has Arrived in Shanghai by Ship, Temporarily Placed in the United European Immigrant Hospital, Paralysis Patients Need This Instrument <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The China Press reported that the first "iron lung" in Shanghai has arrived. After customs inspection today (the 12th), it will be installed in the United European Immigrant Hospital on Huacheng Road near Huishan Road. This is the second "iron lung" in the Far East. The other "iron lung" in Beiping became known worldwide for saving the life of Mr. Snart two years ago. This one was purchased by Sir Sassoon, a wealthy man in Shanghai, and will be temporarily lent to Huacheng Road Hospital. When the United Immigrant Relief Association wishes to obtain a perfect hospital, the "lung" will be moved into the new hospital or donated completely. The new equipment was originally intended to be used by European refugees in this city for free or at a low price. The "iron lung" arrived here on Saturday evening of last week on the Italian ship Corfu. The reporter asked a member of the United Hospital Committee how many people in Shanghai needed an "iron lung". According to the answer, there are many people in the immigrant shelters who suffer from early paralysis, so this kind of instrument is quite needed. There is great hope for the establishment of the new immigrant hospital, and economic assistance has been appealed for in the United States and Britain. It is said that in the spring of 1937, Mr. Snart, the son of a wealthy man in Chicago, suddenly suffered from early paralysis in North China. People in general began to know that there was such a thing as "iron lung", and that only "iron lung" could save his life. At that time, the only "iron lung" in the East was in the Peking Union Medical College, so he was rushed to the "lung", took the train to Shanghai, and then returned to the United States. This incident caused a sensation around the world. Now, although Mr. Shi has largely recovered, he still often hears about being in the "lung". It is also said that the iron lung transported to Shanghai has a power intensity of 220 volts (according to the unit of electricity), and the single side is a 50-line garden.</p>

<p>The Japanese Ship Taian Runs Aground in the Wind</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that the Japanese ship Taian Maru No. 1 ran aground on Saddle Island this morning (the 12th) due to strong winds and waves and sent out a distress signal. Wireless operators in this city and ships at sea received it. A ship of the Moller Company, believed to be the "Isabel Moller," is reportedly docked next to the "Taian Maru." Coastal ships are either anchoring to avoid the wind or proceeding slowly, and scheduled sailing times have had to be changed. Many pedestrians in the streets have fallen, and rickshaws have overturned. However, the streets present a rare scene of tranquility, as most trucks are not driving out to prevent goods from being damaged by the rain. Several yachts at the Shanghai Rowing Club's anchorage in Yangshupu have sunk. It is reported that one or two other yachts safely floated on the huge waves, and some took shelter on the other side of the Huangpu River last night. The fire brigades of the two concessions have been busy since 6:30 AM, and fire engines are being dispatched to the scene of collapsed walls, while ambulances are also being sent to carry people who have been struck by falling bricks and tiles. It is reported that at 6:00 AM this morning, the hurricane was near Zhoushan Island, at 30 degrees north latitude and 122.30 degrees east longitude, about 80 to 90 miles from Shanghai, moving northwest. The Jianghai Customs Building displayed a single ball storm signal last night (illuminated at night). This morning, a hurricane warning signal of two black balls was displayed. A bamboo blind on a pharmacy at the corner of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre fell. Trams were temporarily suspended, and public buses were rerouted. The lead roof and its supports of the house at 893 Qiqihar Road collapsed this morning, injuring six Chinese people. Many walls in the public concession collapsed, injuring many people. Many trees in the Yangshupu district were uprooted. Power lines in many places were also affected. The radio station stopped broadcasting in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Japanese Military Intelligence Department Arrests People in the French Concession Over a Dozen Men and Women Arrested, Temporarily Detained in the French Police Station No Contraband Found, Japanese Request for Extradition Fails <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese Military Intelligence Department dispatched more than a dozen Japanese officers, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives from the Criminal Division of the Public Police, to the French Police Department, claiming that people residing at 142 Rue du Père Froc and a certain place on Route Tenant de la Tour were related to a certain incident and requesting assistance in arresting them. The Western detective chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to proceed to the above-mentioned two locations and arrest more than a dozen men and women. They searched each location but found no contraband. They then took the arrested individuals back to the French Police Station for temporary detention, pending investigation. However, the Japanese request for extradition was unsuccessful. It is reported that the French Police Department is investigating the arrested individuals. The English-language "China Press" reports that twenty Japanese, believed to be members of the Japanese Army Intelligence Department, planned to arrest anti-Japanese terrorists and guerrilla leaders and requested the cooperation of the public and French Concession Police Departments. Accompanied by police officers from the two concessions, they went by car to 142 Rue du Père Froc and a Chinese residence on Route Tenant de la Tour at 4:00 AM this morning (the 12th) and arrested more than a dozen Chinese people, including women and children. They also searched the two residences but reportedly found nothing. The arrested individuals were taken to the French Concession Police Headquarters. The Japanese requested extradition, but the French authorities refused because the Japanese did not provide sufficient evidence. The Japanese then left the arrested individuals in the French Police Station. The names of the arrested individuals could not be confirmed this morning. It is reported that the Japanese accused them of being related to anti-Japanese groups in Shanghai and guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai. The arrival of the Japanese and concession police officers in cars disturbed the neighbors of the two residences.</p>
<h3 id="e86">When Recording Recent National Events, the Minguo Era Must Be Used The Western Era Can Be Appended Later in Parentheses <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Zeng, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, recently sent a letter to all levels of party departments throughout the country, stating that many books, publications, and printed materials published in various places, when recording recent national events, abandon the Minguo era and use the Western era. This is very inappropriate. In the future, the Minguo era must be used, and the Western era must not be used exclusively. When necessary, the Western era can be appended after the national era, with parentheses, to set the record straight. You are to immediately instruct all local newspapers and publications to strictly comply.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Evaluation and Auction of Lida Real Estate Mortgage Handled by the Silver Industry Joint Reserve Real Estate Committee Designated by the Court and Not Related to the Mortgagor <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's report stated that in the case of the auction of the Lida Company real estate mortgage with the Shanghai Bank, the Lida Company's proxy lawyer said that Chen Guangfu, the general manager of the Shanghai Bank, was also the chairman of the Banking Association, so he believed that the estimated amount of 510,000 yuan was obviously biased, and he expressed his opposition. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Bank, Chen Guangfu resigned from the positions of chairman of the Banking Association and general manager of the Shanghai Bank on September 25 of the previous year and June 20 of last year, respectively, and no longer participated in the matter. The Lida Company's proxy lawyer said that Mr. Chen was still the general manager of the Shanghai Bank and the chairman of the Banking Association, which is obviously wrong. In fact, even if Mr. Chen still held his original position, with Mr. Chen's fairness and integrity and the Banking Association's large organization, there would be no bias. Moreover, the actual valuation agency in this case was not the Banking Association at all, but the valuation committee of the Real Estate Evaluation Committee of the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Association, and foreign merchants China Sales Company and Probstfield &amp; Co. also participated. In terms of the relationship, they are the same as Lida Company, which is engaged in real estate business, as real estate merchants. The original price of this real estate is not known to the Shanghai Bank, but since the August 13 Incident, land prices have been falling. Until recently, the selling prices of various large real estate in the central district are still hovering around 60% of the Municipal Council's evaluation. There have been examples in previous newspapers. The Municipal Council's valuation of this real estate is only 480,000 yuan, the Real Estate Association's valuation is 800,000 yuan, including 700,000 yuan for land and 100,000 yuan for houses. After the court's three decisions to reduce the price and auction it to 600,000 yuan, not only was there no major bidding, but even no one paid attention to it. Lida Company previously proposed to value the real estate at 520,000 yuan, which is the amount of the debt, and let the Shanghai Bank inherit it, thinking that the price was too high, it was difficult to find a seller, and it was unwilling to inherit real estate at all, so it refused. Then how can the Banking Association's valuation of 510,000 yuan be said to be biased? The Banking Association's valuation was designated by the court, not requested by the Shanghai Bank, and it should be stated.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Driven by Beastly Desires, Obscenity of a Young Girl, Peking Opera Teacher Arrested <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Gu Abing, who lives at No. 6, Lane 699, Zhejiang Road, sent his 15-year-old daughter Gu Xiushi to Yang Xichang, a Tianjin native at No. 44 Guangxi Road, to learn Peking Opera six months ago. Unexpectedly, at 7:30 PM on the 2nd of this month, Yang took advantage of the teaching of opera to commit beastly desires, using his fingers to dig Gu's lower body, to take pleasure. Although the girl's lower body was injured as a result, she did not dare to tell her parents because of Yang's lewd power. Until the day before yesterday, Gu did not know how, angered Yang, and even beat the girl severely. The girl then fled home and told her father Gu Abing about the obscene acts Yang committed on the 2nd of this month. Upon hearing this, he angrily reported to the Laozha Police Station. Detective Ding Yizhong went to arrest Yang. The girl was sent to the hospital and found that her hymen was damaged. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted according to Article 224 of the Criminal Law. Judge Qian Hongye ordered a ban on spectators because the case was related to morality. As a result, the case was postponed for one week for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Extortionists Huang Xin and Others Convicted <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Huang Xin, a rogue youth who has received secondary education or above, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, colluded with his gang to use the names of the Iron-Blooded Youth Anti-Treason Group and the Patriotic Youth Service Corps to extort money from various firms and shops on the grounds of inspecting inferior goods, obtaining huge sums of money, which were divided and used. The matter was discovered by the Public Concession Police, who arrested Huang and his accomplices Huang Chuanwen, Hua Minxiang, Liu Fuqiu, Zhang Caiyi, Zhang Rongshang, Jiang Bofang, Fei Guishun, Jin Huiquan, Zhang Cuiying (female), Chen Quanlin, Liang Chuli, and other twelve men and women and sent them to the Special Second Court for prosecution according to law. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. As a result, after being sentenced to imprisonment separately, the French Police found that Huang and others had also committed similar cases in the French Concession and sent detectives to the Special First Court to transfer Huang and others to custody. After investigation, in addition to extorting money from five companies, including Meilun Elastic Tape Factory on Ningbo Road, Beixin Yarn Store on Zilaihuo Street, Changji Woolen Cloth Store in Bu Linli, Baida Knitting Factory on Kangti Road, and Xingyu Woolen Cloth Store on Minguo Road, they also took goods to sell for profit. They were sent to the Special Second Court. Except for Chen Cuiying, Chen Quanlin, Liang Chuli, and other three people who were not prosecuted and were released first and sent back to the Special First Court for verification, the French Concession Administrative Authorities' lawyers prosecuted the other nine defendants, including Huang Xin, according to the crimes of intimidation and extortion. The defendants hired lawyers Wang Shizong, Le Junwei, Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and others to defend them. The case has been repeatedly heard and investigated by Judge Zhang Minsheng, and the details have been recorded in previous newspapers. This case has been investigated and concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang went to the Criminal Division 1 and ordered the defendants to be brought to court for sentencing. Huang Xin, Huang Chuanwen, Hua Minxiang, and Zhang Caiyi were sentenced to three years of imprisonment each. Liu Fuqiu, Jiang Bofang, and Fei Guishun were sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment each. Zhang Rongshang and Jin Huiquan were acquitted. After the sentences were pronounced, the defendants were ordered to be transferred to the detention center during the appeal period.</p>
<h3 id="e90">White Russians Exploit the Environment to Swindle Jewish Refugees Claiming That a Large Number of Houses Will Be Built in Hongkou Extorting Huge Deposits, Rents, and Tips The Police Investigated and Arrested All Three Criminals <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Recently, more than 10,000 Jewish refugees have been forced to seek refuge in Shanghai. They are all unfamiliar with the place and have no homes to return to. Therefore, the Public Concession Municipal Council and various charitable organizations have set up shelters to accommodate them. However, some of them have some financial resources and believe that it is not a good policy to rely on accommodation all the time without engaging in production. Therefore, they have been looking for houses to live in or to engage in business. However, in the current environment in Shanghai, it is not easy to find houses. Therefore, although some Jewish people have already found housing, there are still many who cannot find houses. This situation was known by the White Russian Kouk Tros, who organized a so-called Canada Far East Export Company in Room 200 of No. 81 Renji Road, engaged in real estate business, and used the German Jewish Nanch Liouqiu Meike to declare to Jewish refugees that a certain real estate company intends to build a large number of houses in Hongkou, specially for these refugees to rent. It is stipulated that the monthly rent for each single building is 130 yuan, and the monthly rent for a double building is 260 yuan. However, there are not many houses. If you want to rent, you must first pay a deposit rent for one month. Single buildings require an additional tip of 200 yuan, and double buildings require an additional tip of 400 yuan. At that time, more than 100 refugees paid to book houses, paying more than 10,000 yuan to Kou and the other two. In fact, the so-called building and renting of houses is completely Kou's scam. However, after Kou and others cheated such a huge amount of money, they were still not satisfied. Recently, Kou wore a special patrol uniform and went to various refugee dwellings, claiming that those who have booked houses must pay another 260 yuan for a single building and 520 yuan for a variable building, or they would not only confiscate the previous payments but also be expelled. The refugees were in an uproar. The matter was discovered by the police. After investigation, the chief patrol Fang Qishan and the Western detective arrested Kou and the other two on the 11th. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process and requested permission for temporary detention, pending investigation and prosecution. Judge Qian Hongye approved the request and ordered the three defendants to be detained and a hearing postponed for one week.</p>

<p>The pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau" of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is now of an independent nature. Since Shao Shijun obtained this lucrative position through various machinations, he has appointed a large number of private individuals, such as the positions of secretary-general and section chief, which are all filled by relatives. Therefore, he has been plundering on a large scale, accumulating huge sums of money, causing the "Finance Department of the Reformed Government" to covet the bureau for a long time and has been thinking about getting involved. It has repeatedly negotiated with the senior advisors of the Japanese side, intending to bring it under the direct jurisdiction of the department to comply with the "laws and regulations." It is recently learned that the negotiations between the Japanese and the puppets have already shown signs, and the bureau will soon be transferred to the pseudo "Finance Department" for takeover. At the same time, Shao will also be forced to step down. As for the position of the pseudo "Director," it is said that it will be concurrently held by Yan Jiachi, the pseudo "Minister of Finance."</p>

<p>Xiehe Yongji Sailboat Company recently hired Feng Changhe's barge to transport 60 tons of coal ash to Shaoxing for delivery. After customs declaration on the 9th, Sun Guansheng's lighter was ordered to dispatch four lighters to transport the coal ash to the No. 27 floating buoy in Yangshupu for Feng Changhe's boat to load. It is known that Feng Changhe's crew and the boat owner refused to load the coal ash due to the issue of drinking money. The negotiations were delayed and stalled for three days and still not resolved. The four lighters were moored alongside Feng Changhe's barge waiting. Until yesterday morning, a hurricane suddenly struck Shanghai, and the wind and rain caused the four coal-loading lighters to lose their ability to control themselves and all capsized. The boat and coal were completely sunk to the bottom of the river, and the whereabouts of all the crew members were unknown. Therefore, the lighter owner Sun Guansheng reported the information to the Jianghai Customs Water Patrol Room for record. Xiehe and Yongji companies and the lighter owner Sun Guansheng are negotiating with Feng Changhe's boat owner about the compensation for the damage caused by the boat's crew's refusal to load the goods due to the failure to provide drinking money, resulting in the sinking of the boat and cargo.

<p>Respected Sir, I have read the Mubu news in your newspaper on the 11th of this month, titled "Tenant Accuses Landlord of Obstructing Freedom, Landlord Denies the Matter." The plaintiff in this case, Pan Dalong, was shocked to learn of it. Upon investigation, the defendant, Chen Guowan's wife, the second landlord, stated in court on the 8th of this month that on June 22nd, at about 5:00 PM, a Western police interpreter accompanied her to the Pan Dalong's chamber in the pavilion. She took out a steel lock and requested that the chamber door be locked. She personally closed the windows. The draft of the letter to the police station was also on file. It was also stated that she received seven yuan and three corners as Dalong's rent for June, confirming that Dalong lived with Zhang Ziquan. There was no statement that "Zhang Jicheng was arrested for smoking opium at Pan Youcai's place at No. 24 in the same alley, and Pan escaped and took his children to hide in Zhang's chamber in the pavilion and refused to leave." Where did this come from? Long and his sister had lived with Zhang Ziquan in the chamber in the pavilion since October of last year, not just for one day. The neighbors on the left and right have seen it clearly, and it is verifiable. It has nothing to do with whether there is a drug offender in No. 24 in the same neighborhood. The defendant wanted to increase the rent to 15 yuan and 6 corners but failed, so she had the idea of locking up and expelling them, which has already been stated in court. Although it is said that the news was rumored and has nothing to do with it, it is important that your newspaper values fair comments. Now, without relying on the records of the statement, you have highlighted this statement, which may harm the reputation of people not involved in the case and may damage the trust of readers. I hereby declare the proceedings of the court hearing that day and request that you correct it. I would be most grateful. Respectfully, Pan Dalong and Pan's sister, July 12.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listing only decrease by 125 for the Singapore dollar; the rest remained unchanged. The British and American dollar black market showed no excitement. Today, only foreign firms slightly came to close positions, but speculators were restricted by cash and unable to act. Chinese and foreign firms had offers, so the results were neither good nor bad. Although the Bank of England and the Yokohama Specie Bank absorbed futures for this month, speculators and Chinese firms continued to close positions, so the market was very ordinary. In the end, there was no movement up or down. August futures slightly softened because the Western firm Sassoon resumed absorbing and foreign firms were slightly less willing to supply. There were not many transactions in the morning. The Hong Kong dollar suddenly re-emerged above 44 yuan because foreign firms' willingness to sell increased.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the recent London tallies were up 3125, the distant tallies were up 1875, the New York silver price was unchanged, and the London raw gold was also unchanged. The exchange rate of British to American dollars and to Shanghai was flat, and to France was up by one centime. The American dollar to British dollars was up by 0.0625, and to Shanghai and France remained flat. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same (it is rumored that applications have been stopped). The bank's opening spot selling prices were six pence five six two five for the British gold, and twelve yuan seven eight one two five for the US dollar, both unchanged from the previous close. After opening, foreign firms first closed positions, buying HSBC's spot British gold at six pence five six two five, and then closed positions, buying a certain bank's spot US dollars at twelve yuan seven eight one two five. The market was extremely calm. HSBC's listing in the morning only decreased by 125 for the Singapore dollar; the rest remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced, and it was still exempt. Afterwards, Chinese firms such as Huaqiao successively sold this month's US dollars at twelve yuan six two five to speculators. Then, a certain broker sold this month's British gold at six pence four six eight seven five to the Yokohama Specie Bank on behalf of speculators. The situation was also unchanged. Nearing noon, the Western firm Sassoon came to absorb foreign firms' August US dollars at twelve yuan one five six two five. The market slightly softened. At this time, foreign firms' willingness to sell Hong Kong dollars increased. Jardine Matheson offered foreign firms a spot price of forty-four yuan one two five. The market hardened. Extending to the noon close, the bank's spot selling prices were six pence five six two five for the British gold, twelve yuan seven eight one two five for the US dollar, six pence four six eight seven five for this month's British gold, twelve yuan five nine three seven five for the US dollar, six pence two three four three seven five for August's British gold, and twelve yuan one five six two five for the US dollar. As a result, compared to the day before yesterday, the spot and current months were unchanged, August's British slightly tightened by 0.015625, the American dollar slightly softened by 0.03125, and the Hong Kong dollar hardened by 0.25 based on the transaction price. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The half-day transactions are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Small Daily Changes in Cash; Over 300 Taels Traded <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash market situation remained in a hovering state, with occasional ups and downs, which were insignificant. Trading was also very quiet. All parties generally stood by. Although a certain money exchange industry continued to absorb in the middle, cash shops and silver houses had supply, resulting in this stagnant situation. At noon, it was heard that the foreign exchange futures tightened, causing the price to fall and then rise. As a result, it continued to rise by two yuan. Transactions totaled just over 300 taels for the entire day. The gold price of jewelry remained unchanged. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Cash Only Rose Two Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the market, the situation has been flat. The market opened two yuan lower. Silver houses sold 30 taels to gold shops at a price of 2,588 yuan. Then, at the same price, cash shops sold 30 taels to silver houses. A Russian cash shop then sold 10 taels to the money exchange industry at a price of 89 yuan. At this time, a certain money exchange industry resumed trade, and the market improved. A certain money exchange industry bought 50 taels from a certain silver house at the same price. Then, it bought 50 taels from a gold shop at a price of 90 yuan. Later, another money exchange industry also bought 20 taels from silver houses at a price of 90 yuan. It then immediately raised by two yuan. A certain money exchange industry bought 50 taels from silver houses and colleagues, both at a price of 92 yuan. At noon, it fell back by two yuan. The money exchange industry mutually traded 50 taels, with 90 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the transactions became quieter, and the market was stable. The market opened two yuan higher, and cash houses mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 92 yuan. Afterwards, no trading was seen until 3 o'clock, so the evening close was still at 2,592 yuan. As a result, it rose by two yuan compared to the previous day. There were only four yuan of ups and downs throughout the day. The selling price of cash shops was 2,600 yuan, and the buying price was 2,585 yuan. The current price of standard gold is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.

<p>Sino-British Pure Gold is Stable</p>
<p>An 11th London dispatch reported that the price of pure gold remained fixed at seven pounds eight shillings six pence per ounce, so the Central Bank of China's cash buying price remained at 1,212 yuan and 30 cents. The listed customs gold remained at 2 yuan 39 cents 6 li, and the Shanghai standard gold remained at 1,207 yuan and 60 cents.</p>

<h3 id="e132">American and British Gold Pounds Are Strong and Rising <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of pure British gold was unchanged, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.0625. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms settled accounts, and foreign banks supplied smoothly. The market price was stable and unchanged. The market opening price of cash was slightly higher, and customers supplied slightly eagerly, opening at the low price of 2,588 yuan. Then, the money exchange industry absorbed more smoothly on behalf of customers, and the market trended firm. The noon closing price was 9,000 yuan. In the afternoon, customer absorption was even more eager, and the supply was relatively scarce. The opening price was 92 yuan, and the market trended firm. The evening closing price was the same. As a result, it rose by two yuan compared to the previous day. The supply and demand of British and American gold pounds were not strong, the British gold pound was stable and unchanged, the American gold pound was strong and tending to rise. British and American gold notes were traded quite heavily, and the market price did not change much. The British gold note slightly rose, and the American gold note slightly fell. The demand for Hong Kong notes, franc notes, and Annam notes was not smooth, and the prices all fell. The Japanese gold note was stable and unchanged, remaining at 9 jiao 9 fen 8 li.

The other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Discount Rate Unchanged <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for draft bills was 92 yuan per thousand yuan throughout the day, the same as the previous day's price. The money industry association's overnight interest rate also did not change. Both the morning and noon markets were still listed at 1 jiao 8 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e134">World Silver Prices are Fluctuating; Changes in Shanghai Silver Prices <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Since the United States adopted its silver policy, it has maintained a policy of raising silver prices for six years, so the gold-silver ratio has been able to maintain a certain level. Recently, due to the United States' suspension of silver purchases, silver prices in various countries have plummeted. For example, the London large silver tally price has fallen from 19 pence 625 to 16 pence 875. Due to the government's prohibition of transporting and hoarding, and the confiscation by a certain party in the occupied areas, there is little inventory. Also, due to some merchants hoarding to drive up prices, the price has risen to as high as 2 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen per tael. Affected by this, former holders have been dumping their holdings, so the market price once fell to 2 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen. However, the exchange prices of silver jewelry have not decreased, hoping that silver prices will rebound. When the US Senate passed a compromise plan, still allowing President Roosevelt to devalue the dollar and continue to purchase silver, it was heard that the domestic silver purchase price was changed to 7 jiao 1 fen 1 ounce, and the foreign purchase price was changed to 3 jiao 5 fen, but it must be changed daily, depending on the rise and fall of the London large silver market. Also, because speculators are optimistic about the future, they are buying heavily, so the trend is good. It has been heard that the local price has returned to 2 yuan 4 jiao. The restoration of stable silver prices will greatly benefit our country's international finance. (Star)</p>
<h3 id="e135">Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Merchants Continue to Purchase; Cotton Yarn Shows a Small Rebound; Japanese Yarn Continues to Fall <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market, which had fallen on the previous day, showed signs of recovery. The reasons for its improvement were: (1) The panic on the previous day was somewhat excessive, causing a small portion to return to buy cheap goods; (2) The Guangdong merchants had a remittance to Shanghai last night, and Yunnan merchants bought 170 bales of 10-count coarse yarn. Hong Kong merchants imported 20-count Shuangma and Tejin City brand yarns. The Guangdong merchants sold some in real terms and initiated purchases, and the human spirit immediately improved, rising by several yuan. However, at a time when credit is tight, it is fundamentally not allowed to rise excessively. In addition, other yarns are falling and depressed, cheaper than Chinese yarns, and there is fear that the cuckoo will occupy the magpie's nest.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opened in the early morning, and because Typhoon Guofeng arrived in Shanghai, the momentum was very violent, and travel was difficult. The number of people attending the market was reduced by two-thirds compared to usual. It was not until after 10 o'clock that the market opened, and the opening price rose by two or three yuan because the drop on the previous day was too severe, causing a rebound. At the same time, Guangdong had sporadic purchases. The selling price of 20-count Shuangma at the foreign depot was 477.35 yuan. The middle of the day was calm, without much change. However, the big players have a deep-seated concept of rising prices, but it is not allowed by the environment, and their actions are slightly more stable. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 870 bales were traded, and the previous day's afternoon transactions were 175 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 3 yuan, and the price of Muyang rose by 5 yuan. The rest were similar to the previous day. The amount of purchases from each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 335 Yunnan 170</p>
<p>Inland 35 Colleagues 330</p>
<p>Statistics 870 Previous Day's Transactions 175</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market continued to decline, and business became more and more quiet, completely entering a standstill. The current price of 20-count Yueqin yarn is 385 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Woolen Fabric Prices in the Last Ten Years are Rising This Year <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The selling prices of woolen fabrics in the last ten years are worth reviewing in the recent state of high commodity prices. Woolen fabrics were sold in taels of silver, and after the abolition of taels and the change to yuan, prices began to be quoted in national currency from 1933. Therefore, when looking at the table below, the first thing to note is this point. Regarding the prices from 1930 to 1932, if you want to compare them with the prices in 1933, you must first convert them to national currency using 7.15 before you can compare them. Looking at the reason for the price increase of woolen fabrics in 1931, it was because of the implementation of the new tariff, which increased the tax burden and also increased the selling price. However, good times did not last long. The January 28th Incident in 1932 broke the Shanghai market, and the woolen fabric market also fell. In 1933, prices were quoted in national currency, but in reality, they were still slightly lower than the same period in 1932. In 1935, the dumping of Japanese woolen fabrics made the market even more tired. In 1938 and 1939, commodity prices continued to rise, all due to the influence of high foreign exchange rates and the shortage of goods. The recent market price is the highest, more than double that of 1930. There are also those that are more than double. In other words, if you buy one foot this year, you could buy two feet or two feet with some left over in 1930. It can also be said that if you make one piece of clothing this year, you could make two pieces in 1930.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Amount of US Cotton Export Subsidies is Determined by the Government at Any Time, Approximately 6.25 to 8.75 Yuan Per Bale <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was weak at the beginning of the morning due to overseas cotton merchants selling on the market and some bulls closing positions. Later, it improved due to reports from Bombay and Liverpool that prices had risen. The central and western parts of the American cotton area also received unnecessary rain yesterday, which hindered cotton production. It was heard from Washington that the export subsidy would be increased to between 6.25 yuan and 8.75 yuan per bale. The rise and fall of the subsidy fee will be determined by the government at any time, and its main purpose is to depend on the rise and fall of the cotton market. Yesterday, New York rose by two pounds, India rose by the same forecast by two rupees, and Egypt rose by more than ten pounds.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is becoming increasingly quiet. However, North China has a strong demand for cotton. Several Shanghai firms are trying to transport cotton there to trade for cotton yarn and other various products. A certain German firm has been buying more than 2,000 pieces of Indian cotton these days, all of which are being transported to Qingdao. It is said that the others have no trading.</p>
<p>The Chinese and foreign cotton markets have completely fallen into a standstill. The factories have no demand, and not a single transaction has been concluded. The ships from Subei cannot sail to Shanghai due to the hurricane, so there have been no ships arriving at the pier. It is estimated that they will all come to Shanghai after the weather clears up.</p>

<p>The securities gray market yesterday saw a relatively stable market, but the downward trend has not fully subsided. Trading volume has been decreasing, and both bulls and bears are mostly watching and waiting for a clear announcement regarding the payment of principal and interest. Market rumors are based on bullish or bearish positions, with no truth to be found. All inaccurate rumors are merely idle talk and gossip. Trading on the floor is mostly speculation for quick profits. The storm has subsided slightly, and everything is quiet, but the truth will eventually come to light. Yesterday, many offers to buy and sell were listed, but few transactions were completed. Buyers included Datong, Lianhe, Maotai, and scattered individual investors, while sellers included Lianyi, Renchang, Xieda, and Jianli brokers. However, the total transaction volume was only about two to three hundred thousand yuan. Prices decreased slightly by three to seven and a half cents. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions included 100 shares of Hanyang Iron and Steel Company stock at a price of $X.X5 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Due to the unsettled situation, the stock market at the Public Exchange is calm and weak. The heavy storm yesterday prevented many brokers and clients from reaching the Exchange, which also contributed to the sluggish market.

If the situation and weather remain the same, there is little hope for improvement in market sentiment.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Food: Chinese Flour Mills Reduce Production <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market was unusually quiet. Due to the sudden change in the weather during the summer heat, with hurricanes and rainstorms hitting Shanghai, pedestrian traffic on the streets was almost nonexistent, so the number of merchants was even more sparse, and customer demand remained sluggish. Even the small-scale sales of local and inland merchants were minimal. It is heard that Fuxin Flour Mill has partially suspended operations for machinery repairs due to the prolonged stagnation of flour sales and summer maintenance. Fufeng Flour Mill has also reduced flour production. However, flour mills run by Japanese merchants are operating as usual and have not reduced production. Yesterday, the asking price for second-grade flour remained at four yuan and six and a half cents in cash, while returned goods sold for five yuan to five yuan and five cents in remittances, but there were more offers than actual transactions.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of new wheat was also limited due to the wind and rain. The remaining stock from previous arrivals waiting to be sold in warehouses was still considerable. With the demand from Chinese mills sluggish, relying only on the sales of Japanese mills, the market felt particularly weak. The main reasons are nothing more than tight credit and a lack of cash. Yesterday, both supply and demand were low in the market, and Japanese mills showed little interest. As a result, transactions were limited due to a lack of holding power.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Inland Merchants Actively Purchase Passenger Rice <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, inland merchants actively purchased passenger rice, and local rural villages also showed interest. The total daily transaction volume increased to three thousand six or seven hundred bags, and the market showed a firming trend. After Jingwu high-grade rice sold for sixteen yuan and one dime, the sellers intended to raise prices further. Medium and lower grades of machine-milled rice and brown rice were particularly active due to inland demand, and prices were one or two dimes higher than the previous day.</p>

<p>The rice market was affected by the storm yesterday. The supply from various merchants, whether from the river or wheelbarrow deliveries, did not arrive, and no customers visited the market, so trading came to a standstill. Although some brokers made purchases, they were only two or three hundred bags. The market closed around 10:00 AM. The prices were nineteen yuan and four cents for Changbang old glutinous rice and eighteen yuan and nine cents for Wuxi old glutinous rice, more than two dimes higher than the previous market. According to rice merchants, the storm has not caused significant damage to the rice seedlings because the summer heat has passed, the roots are firm, the short stems are resistant to wind, and clear weather will promote growth. If it had happened half a month later, there would have been a risk of damage, it is said.</p>

<p>According to a London telegram, the price of raw sugar for delivery in August was seven shillings and nine pence and one farthing, unchanged for December, and slightly down two five for March of next year, to six shillings and three pence and seven five farthings. Due to the severe wind and rain, few people attended the Shanghai Association's pricing session, resulting in a lack of transactions. The prices for second-grade white sugar and Taikoo Che Bai sugar remained unchanged. National sugar was not quoted. The market situation was stable.</p>

<p>Due to the tense situation in Min'ou, Fujian, it is impossible to transport mushrooms, so the source has been cut off. Sellers rely only on existing inventory for supply. According to Hong Kong news, the price has already reached one hundred and seventy-five yuan, which has further strengthened market sentiment. It is heard that Jian brand is offered for one hundred and thirty yuan cash, with a strong upward trend.</p>

<p>Due to the wind and rain hitting Shanghai yesterday, few people attended the hardware market, so there were few transactions for general goods. However, sporadic business was still conducted. The market for sesame-head nails, which had been quiet for a long time, was relatively active due to good customer sales. For example, more than sixty boxes of three-point varieties were purchased by Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao merchants, priced at forty-five yuan to forty-six yuan. More than twenty boxes of four-point varieties were purchased by inland and Tianjin merchants, priced at forty-three yuan. Customer merchants traded only a dozen boxes of five- and six-point varieties, while colleagues in the lumber district sold more than thirty boxes. Other merchants from Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and other places also purchased more than thirty boxes. The price for five-point nails was forty-two yuan, and the price for six-point nails was forty-one yuan, both higher than the previous market by several dimes to one yuan. As for other scrap iron products, there were also transactions yesterday. For example, foreign round bars were offered at fifteen yuan, foreign plates at fifteen yuan and five cents, triangular iron bars at sixteen yuan, rubber belt heads at thirteen yuan and five cents, old and new leather at ten yuan and five cents, and cement bones at fifteen yuan, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Western Magician Tangui Performs <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Last night, the Western magician Wana performed at the Tangui Tea Garden. The dazzling lights made one suspect that it was a sleepless night; the diverse performances were like entering the market of Persia. Light clothing, small fans, figures, and the fragrance of clothing filled the air. The upstairs and downstairs were almost full, and later arrivals had nowhere to put their feet, which can be called a grand event on the sea! The phrase "men and women sitting together, shoes crisscrossing" can faintly describe one or two aspects of it. The magician first performed various tricks, such as... flying cups sharing a drink, echoes in an empty valley, and dead trees blooming, all extremely magical and incredibly detailed and appropriate. Then a Western girl was supported out, with two poles suspended on a chair, and then the chair was removed, so the poles were suspended in the air, fluttering and flying in the void, like a swallow playing in the palm. After spinning for a while, the girl smiled sweetly and then made a gesture like Yang Guifei losing her hairpin at Mawei, letting out a sigh, and disappearing. Another performance was the magician borrowing three foreign watches from the audience, wrapping them in a foreign handkerchief, and entrusting them to a girl to carry. The girl's hand loosened slightly, and the watches suddenly fell to the ground. The magician pretended to be frightened and searched everywhere, but only two were left. The other one was like a colorful cloud in the sky, not knowing where it had gone. The magician then took two broken watches, placed them in a foreign gun, and stuffed the top with paper. Then he brought out a wooden box, hanging it on the stage, with several small screen doors on the outside. The magician struck the stage with a loud bang, and the screen doors opened to reveal the three watches in the middle. A white dove flew out of the box, circling the stage, rising and falling in time with the music, and the audience applauded! Then a bottle of wine was placed on the stage, with two glass bottles on a side table. The bottles were shown to the audience, empty, covered with glass cylinders. The magician muttered incantations. When opened, the bottle on the stage was empty, and the wine had overflowed from the two side bottles. Then the magician borrowed a Westerner's straw hat, put an egg yolk inside, then added white sugar and mixed it with a spoon until smooth, and then borrowed a ring from the audience and placed it in the hat as well. He then reached into the hat and pulled out a bouquet of colored flowers, with the borrowed ring tied to it. The crowd clapped and cheered! There were also shadow plays, even more novel! There were scenes of battles and food deliveries, like being on a mountain road, making people unable to take it all in!</p>

<h3 id="e151">Essentials of Summer Hygiene <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>—Ying Dai</p>
<p>It's summer again! As summer approaches, diseases are more prevalent than in other seasons, so it's especially important to think about and pay attention to hygiene. Here, based on my personal thoughts, I will describe several hygiene issues that should be noted in various aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the summer.</p>
<p>Clothing Hygiene: The clothes worn in summer are thin and easily get dirty, so they need to be washed frequently, preferably every day. Regarding the weather, the mornings and evenings in summer are much cooler than midday, so the clothes worn in the morning and evening should be thicker and should not be changed less frequently for the sake of coolness. Overly tight-fitting clothes are not hygienic when worn on the body, especially for young men and women whose bodies are not fully developed. They should not wear small clothes just to be fashionable.</p>
<p>Food Hygiene: You need to be most careful about what you eat in summer. If you are not careful, you will get sick, and it will be especially severe in summer. If possible, cook all the meals at home. It is better to eat less at restaurants. All food must be covered to prevent flies. It is best not to eat leftovers. Food exposed to the open air on stalls should not be eaten. It is best not to eat cold drinks, and if you do, do not overdo it. Bowls and dishes must be washed on the same day and washed cleanly. Absolutely do not drink unboiled water.</p>
<p>Housing Hygiene: During the summer, the windows in the house should be wide open. Whether in the courtyard or inside the house, spray disinfectant water every day. It is best to install screens to prevent mosquitoes and flies from entering. If there are patients in the house, they should be isolated. If it is an infectious disease, send the patient to the hospital immediately. If there are mosquitoes in the place you live, install mosquito nets on the beds. Every room must be washed and swept frequently. All utensils must also be wiped frequently to prevent mold growth.</p>
<p>Transportation Hygiene: In the summer, it is better to go out less if you don't have anything to do. If you need to buy something or for other matters, it is better to go out in the morning or evening because going out at midday, when the sunlight is strong, is prone to heatstroke. Even in the morning and evening, you shouldn't walk too much. Every morning, it is best to go to the park for a walk, breathe fresh air, and take a walk, which is also beneficial to hygiene. When you are walking down the street and sweating profusely, do not take advantage of the temporary heat to eat a lot of cold drinks. Even if you want to eat, it is best to eat less.</p>
<p>I believe that if people living in Shanghai can pay such attention to hygiene in clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the summer, they will definitely be able to reduce many diseases and spend the summer safely.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Swimsuits <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>—Lu Lishi</p>
<p>What kind of exercise is most suitable in summer? Football and basketball are too strenuous, and you can't stand the excessive heat. Summer is originally the tennis season, but this kind of thing is not widespread, so under the hot sun, we still jump into the swimming pool, spend a few cents (buying a long-term pass is even cheaper) to take a full bath, practice swimming, and at the same time, in the pool full of mermaids, we join in to join in the fun, at least it's a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>Speaking of swimming, I think of swimsuits. Of course, you can just go to the store to buy one, but we have to choose the most satisfactory swimsuit. Ordinary swimsuits are probably the same style as undershirts, with a pair of pants attached below. People in the water should be as light as possible, everyone should be naked, but this seems too uncivilized. Wearing a piece of clothing to cover some places that cannot be made public, so the material should be soft and the lighter the better. Silk swimsuits can have these two advantages, but the price is very expensive. Isn't it said in the newspaper that Mr. Zhang Shankun went to Hong Kong to buy one for Ms. Tong Yuejuan for dozens of yuan? Most of the ordinary people use cotton yarn, and the price is at least more than one yuan. Therefore, swimming, this sport, may not be very developed in the city because it costs a lot.</p>
<p>Recently, a new type of swimsuit has been invented abroad that allows people who can't swim to float on the water after wearing it, like putting on a lifebuoy, so it is very useful for beginners in swimming. This kind of swimsuit is made of woven fabric, filled with celluloid bladders and a very light grass produced in Brazil, which can provide great buoyancy. People who talk about swimming float and do not sink. This kind of swimsuit looks similar to ordinary ones, but the effect is greater.</p>

<p>When eating vegetables in summer, you should always eat them refreshingly. Fatty fish and meat are a bit daunting. However, fish and meat are not impossible to eat. As long as they are prepared properly, the greasiness can be reduced. For example, dried vegetable braised pork. The pork should not be cut into whole pieces but into small, thin slices. Put more dried vegetables, so that all the meat oil is absorbed by the dried vegetables, and you will not feel greasy. And because the dried vegetables have more meat oil, they are more flavorful. There is also fresh lotus leaf steamed pork, which is one of the famous summer dishes. Cut the pork into thin slices, soak it in high-quality soy sauce for a while, and then wrap it in glutinous rice flour. Cut the fresh lotus leaves into squares, wrap them one by one, and steam them over water. It tastes fragrant and refreshing, and you don't feel the greasiness of the meat. Beef made with onion beef shreds, cabbage tomato beef soup, etc., are not greasy. As for fish, it is not as greasy as pork at all, not to mention stewing and steaming, which are very refreshing. You can also fry the fish in oil first and then cook it with winter melon, which is also very suitable for summer tastes.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Talking about Vegetarianism <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>—He Lisan</p>
<p>Some people say: Vegetables are rich in "vitamins" and iron. Therefore, eating vegetarian food is enough to nourish the body. Promoting vegetarianism is most suitable for hygiene. This is, of course, not objectionable. In fact, when it comes to health maintenance, a person does not necessarily have to be a vegetarian. Because if you eat vegetarian for a long time, there will be too much lack of fat in your diet, and insufficient nutrition will adversely affect your health. It may even lead to anemia. I am in the medical profession, telling you from experience. It is common to see many women who are long-term vegetarians are often weak and sick. Also, because the range of food is too narrow, their appetite will not be good. Eating less, the body will naturally become tired. Moreover, most people who are long-term vegetarians do not know how to maintain their health. Their minds are full of superstitious ideas. They believe that eating vegetarian food, refraining from killing, and receiving the blessings of the Bodhisattva will be reborn in the next life as a blessed person. So, usually bound by this superstition and negativity, they forcibly suppress the most important "appetite" in life. Think about it, eating vegetarian like this completely violates "natural life," isn't it harmful rather than beneficial? In our country, the most emphasis on hygiene has always been on Confucius. And there is the saying "food and sex are natural": advocating "food is never too refined." The principle can also be thought about deeply. In short, everything values "appropriateness." There must also be a standard for vegetarianism. Sometimes you should be vegetarian, sometimes you shouldn't be vegetarian. For example, if you are unwell, you should naturally abstain from meat when you are sick. Or in the hot summer, you should also eat vegetarian food as much as possible. The compromise method is to eat meat and vegetarian food complementarily, not biased. Overindulging in meat and strong flavors is equally detrimental to hygiene. Long-term vegetarianism is not necessarily beneficial to hygiene. The so-called "too much or not enough is equally harmful." This is up to our own choice.</p>
<h3 id="e155">From Eating Fruit to Littering Fruit Peels <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>—Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Spring has quietly passed away, and the hot summer has come rushing in. Speaking of "spring flowers and summer fruits," summer is the season for the ripening of melons and fruits. Walking into the market, you can see them everywhere. In Shanghai, which is known as an isolated island, it is still possible to transport them from other places, which cannot be said to be the good fortune of the people on the isolated island.</p>
<p>Fruit is a side dish for Westerners after meals. It is said to help digestion and clear the stomach. Even at our banquets, there are four dishes of fruit for drinking and sobering up. Moreover, in the hot summer, eating melons and fruits is indeed a wonderful way to relieve heat and quench thirst, so I am not against eating fruit, but I have two rules for fruit; (1) Do not eat fruits that are not hot or rotten, (2) Absolutely do not throw away the skins of melons and fruits anywhere, especially in the middle of the street! The former is of course harmful to hygiene and may even cause disease, while the latter is the development of bad habits. It is often seen that people of the lower class buy fruits on the street, eat them while walking, and throw the peels into the street, which is the worst! I try to explain as follows; eating fruit along the street is not unaesthetic, but littering peels is an act of violating police regulations, first, the dirty vegetable peels attract mosquitoes and flies, hindering public hygiene, second, pedestrians may inadvertently step on them and slip, which damages morality, and third, there are many bad impressions, so I specifically mention it, hoping that people who throw away melon and fruit peels at random will refrain from doing so!</p>
<h3 id="e156">Talking About Cold Drinks <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>—Xin Fo</p>
<p>Once the hot season arrives, all businesses become bleak, but only cold drinks have an endless stream of customers. Like before the August 13th Incident, tens of thousands of dan of watermelons were transported to Shanghai from the inland for sale. Now, due to transportation inconveniences and various restrictions, I am afraid that the general public cannot enjoy this good fortune. So last year, the sour plum soup and popsicles of the Mukden cold drink industry were in short supply, breaking all previous sales records. Because the prices are low and the taste is beautiful, popsicles are convenient to eat, even if you are walking on the road, sitting in the car, or lying on the beach, you can have one in hand to cool off and relieve the heat. However, there are many miscellaneous brands on the market, and the manufacturing is sloppy, which is quite dangerous to eat. It is best to buy famous products such as Beauty Brand, Ice Wheel Brand, and Golden Camel Brand, because they are indeed made with boiling water.</p>
<p>Fashionable people and playboys, when summer arrives, ice cream and fresh orange juice become their only drinks. Like in the Suzhou-Jiaxing area, there is a homemade cold drink called "jelly," which is no less delicious than the above two. There is now domestic jelly for sale, and the production method is extremely simple. You only need to mix it with water, boil it, and let it solidify, then cut it into small pieces, pour in frozen mint water, and add white sugar and homemade plum sauce to make it. It quenches thirst, promotes salivation, and is beautiful and refreshing. Summer has arrived, so why not ask your Shanghai friends to try it at home. (Note: Plum sauce is made by boiling ripe plums until they are rotten, removing the sour dew, and adding white sugar. The more you boil it, the better. It is not sold on the market.)</p>
<h3 id="e157">About Swimming <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>—Competition</p>
<p>The swimming pools have all opened: of course, people living in the bustling city can get a relatively "quiet" place again. The clothes on your body are thin, and the water in the pool is so cool, you can relieve the heat all over your body by jumping into the water; who says there is no fun? And it is also a strength-building exercise that can make your muscle lines healthy and beautiful, it is really the best!</p>
<p>Here I want to tell you some things to pay attention to when swimming: Our swimming time is best in the morning or about two hours after a meal; before entering the water, you should do a few minutes of gentle exercise and deep breathing to warm up the whole body and make your limbs flexible, so that you can be more active after entering the water. If you feel a little tired or cold in the water, you should immediately get out of the water to rest; if you are a beginner, then it is best not to stay in the water for more than thirty minutes each time. Before swimming, it is best to plug the ear canal with cotton and apply Vaseline or something similar on the outside; if you don't use cotton, then you must remember to dry the water in your ears after swimming to avoid ear canal inflammation. After swimming, you must also rub your whole body with a dry towel until the skin turns red; frequent rubbing like this can strengthen the skin! If you encounter cramps, you should try to massage the affected area or apply hot water.</p>
<p>There are also a few points to pay special attention to: If we want to swim, it is best to have more people, because swimming alone is a dangerous thing. It is not advisable to swim after eating too much, because it will hinder digestive function. You should not go swimming when your body is not very comfortable. You should not swim after a long walk or strenuous exercise. Many people neglect this point the most, but they do not know that the body's temperature changes too quickly, which can cause cramps or other diseases!</p>
<p>If you are not good at swimming, you should not practice diving in places where you do not know the depth of the water; if you have not done considerable research on lifesaving methods, you should not risk entering the water to save people, you should only use equipment or other methods on the shore to rescue.</p>
<p>These many points are partly heard and partly referenced, but there are always some points that are quite valuable. I am writing them here to contribute to the many people who are active in the blue waves.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Methods for Eliminating Bed Bugs <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— (Chen Mingxi)</p>
<p>As the weather gradually warms up, Shanghai will become a world of bed bugs. The lower and middle classes suffer the most, with these blood-sucking creatures lurking in cracks in boards, on mattresses, and in orange chairs. Now, I have several methods for eliminating bed bugs. If your residences are troubled by bed bugs, you might as well choose a convenient and easily accessible one to try.</p>
<p>First Method: Mash peach leaves and apply the paste to the cracks where bed bugs reside. The scent will immediately paralyze the bed bugs, and they will never revive. If you worry that peach leaf juice will stain the curtains and bedding, leaving marks, you can grind dry peach leaves into powder and spread it between the bedding and bed boards, which will have the same effect.</p>
<p>Second Method: Place wheat straw under the bedding, then boil buckwheat straw with water and pour it hot into the cracks, killing the bed bugs instantly.</p>
<p>Third Method: Grind eel bones and pangolin scales into a fine powder and simmer it under the bed. Bed bugs are most afraid of this smell and will die immediately after smelling it.</p>
<p>The above three methods are all easy to implement and cost very little. I have personally tested them and found them to be very effective. I dare to introduce them to readers so you can avoid a summer of disturbance.</p>

<p>— Chan Chen</p>
<p>Late spring has quietly passed, but the wheel of time has secretly ushered in the prelude to a new summer. As the seasons change, people's lives naturally undergo considerable changes.</p>
<p>Summer is a period when diseases are most rampant and active. Cholera, vomiting and diarrhea, prickly heat, and cholera are even more terrifying. Some people believe that if they can safely get through the summer, they can relax at other times. This is not an exaggeration but a real fact. Therefore, we must be especially careful about clothing, food, housing, transportation, and daily life in the summer. Although it may seem too early to discuss these issues at the beginning of summer, it is good to "plan ahead" and discuss them in advance.</p>
<p>Clothing: Summer clothing should be light and simple, unlike the hassle and expense of wearing layers upon layers in other seasons. In the past, summer clothing materials mostly used spun silk and Indian silk for their lightness and coolness. However, at this moment, the people in the occupied areas cannot live and work in peace to raise silkworms and reel silk. These materials are naturally mostly artificial silk. If you want to be true to your conscience, it is better to wear less of that kind of clothing. Authentic domestic products include crepe, Xiangyun gauze, and Wanzai summer cloth, which are strong and stylish. Everyone may want to try wearing them, but I'm afraid there won't be many available this year. As for the color of summer clothing, white is the most appropriate because it can reflect sunlight. Black or dark-colored clothes absorb sunlight and are very hot. Also, although we don't want to dress like flamboyant "lotus dandies" in the summer, going shirtless and wearing shorts is both unsightly and unhygienic, so I hope it will be absolutely avoided.</p>
<p>Food: This is the most important thing. As the saying goes, "Calamity comes from the mouth, and disease enters from the mouth." Especially in summer, most diseases are caused by improper diet. Because the weather is hot in summer, the human stomach and intestines are relatively weak. Therefore, it is best not to eat greasy, meaty foods and other foods that are difficult to digest, as these things are detrimental to health. Some people advocate vegetarianism in the summer, not to cultivate immortality and become a Buddha, but truly for health and hygiene, which is worth promoting. There are also some people who are greedy for small gains and eat cheap, unsanitary ice cream, sour plum soup, fresh orange juice, mung bean soup, and other things, which are all causes of disease and should be handled with caution. There is also a hateful thing in the summer—flies, which carry microorganisms on their feet and harm people by flying around. Generally, if a person inadvertently eats food that has been contaminated by flies, they are guaranteed to get sick, so everyone must rise up and eliminate them.</p>
<p>Housing: It is not easy to live in an isolated island. The usual cramped, pigeon-cage-like houses are already suffocating, and in the summer, it is even easier to suffer from heatstroke. Finding a more spacious house is difficult. On the one hand, there is the problem of overcrowding, and the demand for housing exceeds the supply. Where can one find it? On the other hand, even if you discover a water source in the desert and find a relatively spacious house, the unscrupulous landlord thinks it is a "rare commodity" and demands a price that makes you gasp and feel discouraged. "Hanging salted iron on your nose," don't even think about it. Therefore, "housing" is a very serious problem this summer. Some people, because their living quarters are cramped and there is no other way, sleep outdoors with just a pillow and a mat. Although it is temporarily cool, it will cause problems. It is better for everyone to tidy up their houses, move out some empty space, and find some peace of mind and mental tranquility, which may help to dispel some of the heat.</p>
<p>Transportation: Summer travel should be simpler than in other seasons. Walking around under the sun is very easy to suffer from heatstroke, and it is very inconvenient to sweat profusely as soon as you move. Therefore, all unnecessary socializing and unnecessary travel in the summer are best "rested."</p>
<p>What has been said above applies only to ordinary common people. As for those classes who live in foreign houses and ride in cars, they should be considered separately.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Self-Promotion <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>It is said that self-promotion by writers is a somewhat popular and despised habit. But I think the issue lies in the motivation for self-promotion. If the motivation is for personal gain, then even if it cannot be summarily judged as a despicable act, at least such promotion is of little value. However, because the "self" is involved, even the introduction and criticism of objective motivations are all considered despised habits, which is too restrictive of the broad significance of scholarship.</p>
<p>For example, if a writer writes something, they are only allowed to be criticized by others and forbidden to say a word themselves, otherwise they will be ridiculed for "self-promotion." I think this attitude is very unfair when applied to academic exploration. Such an attitude is rarely seen in Western academic circles, but it is still quite popular among Chinese writers. This is a major obstacle to the progress of scholarship.</p>
<p>I personally believe that rather than rejecting self-promotion, it is better to allow even self-boasting to exist. The reason is that in the exploration of scholarship, self-boasting cannot have a long-term possibility of survival; boasting may deceive readers for a while, but the boaster can only benefit from that opportunity to exist. Conversely, liberating objective self-promotion is giving greater freedom to academic research. If an author dares to introduce their own writing, dares to express the views of their own work, wouldn't this be a help to other critics and general readers?</p>
<p>Although self-promotion is not a popular term, self-criticism has long been accepted as a tool for progress. In fact, self-promotion and self-criticism are nothing more than two means of self-knowledge: one is active, and the other is passive. Non-objective self-criticism is actually subjective self-promotion—boasting; objective self-promotion is equivalent to objective criticism.</p>
<p>A well-known writer often, at the request of readers or out of self-motivation, specially recommends some of their works to readers. This behavior can also be said to be self-promotion. And almost every famous writer does this without feeling ashamed, because the effect of this kind of promotion comes entirely from pure self-knowledge, without any personal gain involved. Although such self-recommended works may still be unavoidable with the author's own biases, in most cases, they are indeed the author's representative works.</p>
<p>I do not suggest using self-promotion as an independent tool for academic advancement, because this would lead to many abuses. My meaning is to treat it as a means of self-knowledge, to be used in conjunction with self-criticism, another means.</p>
<p>It is not enough to think that self-criticism is self-knowledge, because criticism only fulfills the task of the passive aspect; active self-encouragement still requires self-promotion with self-confidence.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be stated that the "promotion" here does not refer to the overused promotion in political terminology, but rather to the original meaning of advocacy—the self-expression of belief.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Mao Guang's "Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas" <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>I recently read Mao Guang's "Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas" and would like to say a few words.</p>
<p>Mao Guang, styled Heting, was a native of Rufu, Jiangsu, and a descendant of Mao Pijiang, the author of "Shadow Plum Hermitage Recollections." In addition to Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas, there are also "Xiaosanwu Pavilion Lyrics" (originally named Guizhai Oral Sins) and others. His prose has been selected into the New Ancient Prose Anthology. His son Shuyan is the author of "Fighting in Northern Shaanxi."</p>
<p>I met Mr. Mao once at a gathering of musicians. I spoke Mandarin, and he spoke fluent Mandarin to me. Later, he spoke Jiangxi dialect and Huguang dialect to other acquaintances. It can be said that he had a talent for languages—he must have been a very interesting person. His flowing white beard also reminded me of Feng Zikai for no reason. The phrase "乖乖龍東" (guai guai long dong) in "Departure Temple" is just a natural expression, not fully expressing Mr. Mao's strengths.</p>
<p>Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas contains eight miscellaneous dramas, several of which mention the author's ancestors. "Departure Temple" takes Mao Pijiang as the protagonist, so it goes without saying. Even in miscellaneous dramas with other people as protagonists, they are often mentioned. For example, in the drama "Zheng Tuoniang," Mao Pijiang's inscription on the sword-speaking picture in the army is mentioned, and in the drama "Ma Xianglan," the poetry collection of the Four Beauties of Qinhuai selected by "Mao Boqi" is mentioned. Lin Qin'nan's "Evening Illumination Temple for Mr. Mao Chaomin's Birthday Record" says: "Heting is erudite and capable of poetry, honoring Mr. Chaomin, even broken silk and scattered fragments, he must pick up and hide them." He cherished his ancestors' legacy so much that it is no wonder he repeatedly mentioned them in the dramas.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao also liked to talk about Buddhism. "Ye Nu Returning Soul" and "South Sea God" contain many Buddhist terms. This can be seen from the preface to his Guizhai Oral Sins, where he claimed to have "studied Buddhism for forty years in Guizhai," so it can be known why he liked to talk about Buddhist principles in his dramas.</p>
<p>There must also be many authors and readers. The Magpie Stepping Branch in "Departure Temple" is similar to "Thinking of Mortal Life," and the Leisurely Tune in "Ma Xianglan" is similar to Xu Wei's Four Cries of the Gibbon.</p>
<p>These eight miscellaneous dramas all use women from the late Ming Dynasty as their subjects. The characters in the first four are Wu Ruixian, Ye Xiaoluan, Ma Xianglan, and Bian Yujing. Each person has one act, like the Four Cries of the Gibbon and Four Beautiful Women. The characters in the last four are Wang Huajiang, Yun Shiniang, Yin Niang, and Zheng Tuoniang. Their counterparts are Qu Dajun, Chen Qinian, and others. Among them, some literati, seeing that the country was about to perish, indulged in pleasure in a perverted way, committing slow suicide. Although it is not something we should emulate, their mood is pitiful. Here are just a few selected epigrams: "Who knows Lingjun's hard heart?" (Opening scene at the end) "What can be done, remembering the broken homeland... fleeing in a small boat. Endless tears for the country, a miserable nest barely surviving." (Departure Temple) "Princess of Zhongshan, creating chaos before entering the palace, driven away by the northern soldiers with a single whip." (Bian Yujing) "Seeing that the Central Plains is losing its deer, who says that women do not fly heroically?" "Like Qin Liangyu, generous, more proud than Long Gejun's women's army." (Yun Shiniang) "Swallows on the riverbank, the old nests are all gone." "Hongguang fled south, the mountains and rivers in a hurry, the birds' clothing of the Wang and Xie families all withered." "Worry, can't bear to watch this country weep." (Zheng Tuoniang)</p>
<p>At the end of the song, I think that the most praiseworthy character is Liu Jingting, who appears last. Looking at it through tinted glasses, I hope that Mr. Mao will write another miscellaneous drama to show Mao Pijiang's heroic spirit when he stayed in Nanjing to defend against the rebellion.</p>
<p>What I like as much as Guizhai Miscellaneous Dramas is Mr. Mao's recent Dragon Mountain Gathering: "The flames of war are spreading, everywhere in the north and south, Yan Zhao and Wu Chu. Counting the annual sorrow in autumn, it is not as bitter as this year."</p>
<h3 id="e162">(3) Five Methods of Approaching God <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>(1) Always think that God is omnipresent, and say like the poet: "Where can I go to escape your spirit? Where can I go to escape your face? If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I am in hell, you are also there." If a person always keeps this thought in mind, then over time, they will naturally develop a sense of awe for God, and all their actions will be cautious and careful, daring not to be careless. Our behavior must be pure and flawless, and we must not commit the slightest sin, because in the final judgment, the Lord's judgment is extremely clear, and there is no way to escape. (2) No matter what you see, you must think that God exists there and think of God's power and grace. For example, seeing the sun, think of God's glory; seeing fire, think of God's passion; seeing water, think of God's kindness. God sends down sweet dew, nurturing all things and providing for people's needs in life. At the same time, he also gives us comfort in our hearts. If we maintain this concept, we can promote our good intentions, strengthen our faith, and dispel all evil thoughts and delusions. (3) When a person is living in solitude, they should often meditate on God. A saint once said: "The work of dark contemplation is to build a holy temple in the heart for God to dwell in." (4) God lives inside us and also lives inside our brothers and sisters, so if our brothers and sisters lack food and clothing, we should help them, and God will surely be pleased. (5) All living beings in the world are created by God and are loved by God as much as we humans, so we must not treat or harm any living creature.

<h3 id="e163">Talking About the Past (Part 1) <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Keshan</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many alarming news items, which can be seen in various news reports, saying: at what time, what will happen; at what time, what will happen. But everyone's psychology hopes that these will not become a reality.</p>
<p>Now, let's not talk about these things, let's talk about past facts. Because the newly opened Haitian Bookstore in Shanghai asked me to proofread Xu Mengxin's "Comprehensive Compilation of Northern Alliance Affairs of the Three Dynasties" of the Song Dynasty, which aroused my interest in talking about it. Among them, according to the annual events, the deeds of the Jin people's wars and peace with the Jin people during the forty-five years of the three dynasties of Huizong, Qinzong, and Gaozong are compiled, and more than three hundred kinds of unofficial records are collected, becoming a masterpiece of 1.3 million words. Mr. Ji Xiaolan, the "Chinese" Didai Lu, once commented that it was "erudite and detailed, and no other work at the time could surpass it." It can be seen that it is a very valuable book.</p>
<p>What I am proofreading is the second year of Jingkang (the reign title of Song Gaozong), a period of facts after Huizong and Qinzong were captured and the Jin people established Zhang Bangchang as emperor.</p>
<p>At that time, the Jin people were determined not to let the Zhao family rule anymore, but the hearts of the Chinese people were very excited and supported the court, so that the Jin people did not dare to directly take it as their own. Since Qinzong went to the city for peace talks, thousands of scholars and commoners gathered at the South Gate every day to welcome the emperor's carriage. Later, they even gathered Taoists and monks to set up altars along the streets to pray, making the whole city noisy and filled with incense. Although it was close to superstition, the direction of the people's hearts was very clear. Another passage writes about Li Ruoshui resisting the imperial decree:</p>
<p>On that day, after reading the decree, the Han envoy Nianhan made Qing take off his imperial clothes. Ruoshui stepped forward and held them up, telling him not to take them off, saying, "This is乱做(luàn zuò, doing recklessly). This is the true emperor of the Great Dynasty. You dog辈(bèi, bunch) cannot be disrespectful." Holding it with his left hand and pointing at Nianhan with his right hand and scolding him, he was beaten on the head by several people, blood splattering everywhere. After a while, he saw that he had put on the imperial clothes, and he immediately fainted to the ground. After a while, everyone dispersed, and Ruoshui also recovered slightly.</p>
<p>This can also express the people's loyalty to the country at that time, so that the Jin people did not dare to swallow China in one gulp.</p>
<p>At that time, the most active Wu and Mo were the two people who forced the Supreme Emperor (Huizong) into the wilderness and took the empress and princes. At this time, the Jin people did not dare to take China's land as their own, and asked the chief officials of the court to elect someone who could replace the Zhao family as emperor. However, the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor Sun Fu and others submitted statements to the court four times, still hoping to preserve the Zhao family. Later, the people knew that these Jin people wanted to harm the country, and they all looked at each other and cried. Even the great national traitor Fan Zongyin was called to comfort the army and the people.</p>
<p>The Jin people ordered to gather hundreds of officials to elect an emperor of a different surname, but who should be elected? The compilation records:</p>
<p>Wang Shiyong again ordered Fan Zongyin to guard the provincial gate, using the matter of recommending Zhang Bangchang to speak to the army and the people. In the inner front government, the terrace officials were stripped of their duties and ordered to quickly provide their names and titles to support him. Those who dissented were escorted to the front of the army. The army, the people, the elderly, the monks, and the Taoists looked back and remained silent, nodding and retreating. Only the students of the Imperial College replied, "What we have seen..." meaning "not quite so." Fearing that the army and the people would follow suit, they raised their voices and rebuked the crowd, saying, "Loyalty is the most important thing today, not filial piety alone." Then they ordered their colleagues to return to school. At that time, Sun Fu and Zhang Shuye had already left, and only Shiyong presided over the matter. Hundreds of officials were gathered, but they only saw ten screens of white paper, ordering them to write their positions and names and then retreat. The sad words were kept secret and not shown to the public. Thin paper, Wu Sheng and Mo Shi submitted their statements and left.</p>

<p>— Written by Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>Vasika's day of retribution finally arrived.</p>
<p>One evening, before the prostitutes went to the parlor to receive guests, they were having dinner in the dining room with their clothes loosely worn. At that time, one of them, named Lida Milnogurova—a bold, cruel, and slovenly woman—looked out the window and said:</p>
<p>"Vasika is here."</p>
<p>A torrent of worried curses erupted.</p>
<p>"Come and see!" Lida shouted, "That guy is drunk. He's with the police... Come and see!"</p>
<p>Everyone ran to the window.</p>
<p>"They're taking his clothes off!... Look!" Lida shouted happily, "Oh, he's injured!"</p>
<p>Curses and malicious laughter filled the dining room—the laughter of vengeful joy. The prostitutes jostled each other and ran to the door to greet their helpless enemy.</p>
<p>They saw the officer and the driver supporting Vasika. Vasika's face was pale, and large beads of sweat welled up on his forehead. His ruined left leg dragged behind him.</p>
<p>"Vasika! Laineinichi! What's going on!" the madam shouted.</p>
<p>Vasika shook his head weakly and replied hoarsely:</p>
<p>"I fell..."</p>
<p>"He fell off the cart..." the officer said, "He fell, and his leg got caught in the wheel and broke... That's all!"</p>
<p>The prostitutes fell silent, but their eyes flashed with fire.</p>
<p>People carried Vasika to the attic and put him on the bed, while someone called for a doctor. The prostitutes stood by his bed, looking at each other without saying a word.</p>
<p>"Get out of here!" Vasika said to them.</p>
<p>No one moved.</p>
<p>"Now you're happy!... (7)"</p>

<p>— Wang Xianzai</p>
<p>Editor's Introduction: Wang Xianzai dedicated himself to the screen very early and has long enjoyed the reputation of "the number one villain." But in person, he is a very nice gentleman. From what is stated in this article, it is known that this is motivated by something, which shows that his success on the screen is well-deserved and very interesting.</p>
<p>After dabbling in the film industry for nearly twenty years, I have acted in more than a hundred films. Because I have always specialized in playing villainous roles, the result I have achieved so far is that I have left the audience with a bad impression of being "extremely wicked" and have won many evil names and curses such as "standard villain" and "bad guy." I often think about it and find it very funny: if a person really did this to such an extent, he would obviously be "pointed at by thousands of people" and should have "died without illness" long ago!</p>
<p>"Wang Xianzai, this bad guy, has never played a 'good guy' on the screen." That's right, this is indeed the real situation. But why do I only play "bad guys"? Am I really incapable of playing "good guys"? In the simplest words: this is really all forced upon me by the environment, that is, there is a surge of anger hidden in my heart, and I always feel that I must vent it in this way, which is why it was created.</p>
<p>In my performance on the screen, I am an "unforgivable" great sinner; here, like a criminal! I am willing to make a very sincere confession about the origin and experience of my evil deeds.</p>
<p>The Motivation for Thinking of Doing Evil</p>
<p>When I was young, I grew up in Vladivostok. My father was a well-known local businessman, and his business was not small. Unfortunately, when I was eleven years old, he fell ill and passed away, leaving our mother and several children. My mother suffered from illiteracy, and I was a very young child; all property matters were handled entirely by several relatives. Unexpectedly, they were real bad guys. They bullied the widow and orphans, fabricating documents and playing various tricks, trying to seize the family property. Within a few years, they had suffered great misfortune.</p>
<p>This painful memory, and the faces and behaviors of those seemingly kind but sinister villains, are forever deeply engraved in my mind. Later, when I entered society, I suffered a lot of deception and oppression, and my nerves were also severely stimulated. Because under cold observation, I saw too many faces of bad people, and I heard and saw a lot of bad people's evil deeds, so after entering the film industry, I made up my mind to use this "experience" as a target for imitation. Therefore, I thought of doing evil and became a heinous "bad guy."</p>
<p>My motivation for being a "bad guy" was motivated by something; my purpose for being a "bad guy" was to have a little edifying effect. I hope that there will be no bad people in the world in the future, and my "bad guy" on the screen will have no way to do evil at that time.</p>

<p>— Degang</p>
<p>Hollywood's Joint Production Company is now filming a blockbuster called: "Confessions of a Nazi Spy." Naturally, there are often shots of Hitler in the film, but after searching all of Hollywood, no one was completely similar to Hitler and could take on this important role. There was no way, so the director decided to invite Mr. Hitler himself to play the role.</p>
<p>The method is this: old newsreels and photos of him in daily newspapers and magazines are selected one by one, gathered together, and some cutting and pasting is added, which is enough to meet the needs of Hitler's shots in the film.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Hitler himself has been very busy with the Danzig issue recently and cannot spare time to come to Hollywood to film, this is equivalent to him personally appearing on the screen.</p>

Naturally, there are often shots of Hitler in the film, but after searching all of Hollywood, no one was completely similar to Hitler and could take on this important role. There was no way, so the director decided to invite Mr. Hitler himself to play the role.</p>
<p>The method is this: old newsreels and photos of him in daily newspapers and magazines are selected one by one, gathered together, and some cutting and pasting is added, which is enough to meet the needs of Hitler's shots in the film.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Hitler himself has been very busy with the Danzig issue recently and cannot spare time to come to Hollywood to film, this is equivalent to him personally appearing on the screen.</p>

<p>The Grand Floral Mask Assembly, sponsored by the Pingdi Guoju Art Revitalization Association, was performed at the Xin Xin Theater on the evening of the 2nd of this month. A total of five plays were performed. After the "Skipping the Officials' Hat" performance, there was a double act of Qiu Shirong and Wang Quankui's "The Double Package Case," followed by Liu Lianrong's "White Dragon Pass," and then Ding Jiashan, with Hou Rui playing Li Da.

The finale was "The Imperial Orchard," with Jin Shaoshan playing Yuchi Gong, Ci Ruiquan playing Da Cheng, and Guan Shengji playing Yuan Ji.</p>
<p>In Kun Chou Xu Dongxia's troupe, after the male lead Xu Dongming fell ill, there was no suitable male actor to fill in, and there were no performances for a long time. On the 2nd of this month, Dongxia premiered "Hongxian Stealing the Box," and engaged the young female actress Chang Fuhua. Fuhua is the daughter of Dang Shao Ting and is very talented in the arts. On that day, she performed "The Golden Combination Plate Pass," which received great praise.</p>
<p>The young male actor Long Wenbo has formed a troupe and performed "Qingfeng Pavilion" at the Chang'an Theater during the day on the 2nd, along with "Eight Great Hammers," two acts. The troupe includes female lead Tian Bailin, young male lead Zhou Weijun, supporting role Zhang Chunyan, Zha Jinkui, and old female role He Shengqing.</p>
<p>After Yang Baosen returned to Peiping, he rested for a while. He originally intended to collaborate with Dian Eyun, but due to the request of the Zhongjin Theater Troupe, he could not refuse and agreed to cooperate. It has been decided that he will perform at the Guangde Theater on the evening of the 14th of this month. The repertoire includes Zhao's Mei School famous play "Luoshen" and Yang's masterpiece "Lost Kongcheng Pavilion," which were extremely popular at the time and can be expected to be a great success.</p>
<p>The Yamen Pass of the Drama School, from the first to the fourth act, has already been performed. The fifth to eighth acts are scheduled to be performed at the Chang'an Theater on the evening of the 8th of this month.</p>
<p>The Collection Tower of the Fuliangcheng Society, starring Hou Shengzhang, performed the fifth act on the 4th of this month and the sixth act on the 8th of this month, both of which were sold out and were very popular among the people of Peiping.</p>
<p>The new film "Wuthering Heights," starring Merle Oberon, will soon be released in Shanghai. This is her recent photo.</p>

<p>Zhao Tongshen (Furongcao) has long been highly paid and has earned a good reputation. In fact, Mr. Tongshen lives in seclusion, promoting national opera. He founded a labor school and rebuilt the Gengsu Theater on a grand scale, making it the best in the north and south of the Yangtze River. He hired Ouyang Yuqian to preside over the competition, and Yuqian then invited Tongshen, Zha Tianying, Wu Wozun and others as instructors. Yuqian is the chief of the northern and southern school blue shirts, and gets along very well with Tongshen. In addition to presiding over teaching affairs and performing every night, Yuqian also uses his spare time to arrange new plays, mostly based on the books "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Lianzai." The play "Chang'e Benyue," is especially popular. Every performance is a collaboration with Tongshen, and the two are in perfect harmony, with the wonderful effect of complementing each other. Tongshen knows Yuqian's strengths well and understands everything. After spending several years together, he has benefited deeply. Therefore, Tongshen's art is skilled in both northern and southern schools, and his current good reputation is not accidental. It is remembered that in the play "Chang'e Benyue," Yuqian played Chang'e and Tongshen played Wu Gang, and the wonderful expressions and actions can be called the best of both. Now that Yuqian is working hard in the film industry, this tune has truly become Guangling San!</p>

<p>— Lüe E</p>
<p>Pinghua master Guo Shaomei was the founder of Yuyushe at the end of the Qing Dynasty and one of the five tiger generals of the society. He was good at telling "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Five Tigers Pacifying the West," and could also tell "Liaozhai." Shaomei had extremely deep academic roots and was very knowledgeable. When telling "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," he always quoted classics and cited historical facts, geography, and characters, so that everything was clear and correct. He increased people's knowledge. Guo has damaged books for more than fifty years. Later, due to old age, he specialized in teaching Chinese and history in a certain school, teaching students to enjoy his later years. Guo first came to Shanghai more than twenty years ago and performed in Xuxulou outside Datongmen East Street, succeeding Yue Chuantai's head Cheng Hongfei. After refusing to write books, he often enjoyed tea at Tianchan Teahouse. A few weeks ago, he suddenly fell ill and could not afford to get up. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away on the 3rd of this month. He was over seventy years old. His sons and daughters-in-law are all in the mainland and were unable to see him off in person. Guo has no savings and his funeral is bleak. From then on, the Pinghua world lost another one, which is indeed a great loss.</p>

<p>The Yifeng Drama Society at the Carlton Grand Theater is taking a two-week summer break. It is now scheduled to start performing on the 17th, staging a three-act version of "Wen Su Chen." The main roles have been assigned to Zhou Xinfang as Wen Su Chen, Gao Baisui as the former letter and later the crown prince, Wang Xichun as Xu Yunu, Jin Suwen as Zhao Xuangu, Liu Wenkui as Hong Wen, Zhang Huicong as the former Jie Cuilian and later Xie Hongdou, Yu Zongying as Jie Er, Wang Lanfang as Liu Shi, Lu Lingyun as Liu Huchen, and Ma Jinfeng as Yu Guanyin, etc.</p>
<p>The All-Stars Stage will add roles after the autumn coolness.

As for the original cast, several people will be leaving. The authorities have not yet announced their names.</p>
<p>The Grand Stage's thirty-seven-act "Journey to the West" has begun to be promoted. Rumors that the Gaiden is coming to an end and will be replaced by "Water Margin" are inaccurate. The scenery director Liu Fenghai is planning to rush to produce grand scenery that has never been shown in Shanghai before, and has invited a magician to guide several extremely mysterious mechanisms.</p>
<p>The Chaozhou opera at the Queen's Theater is coming to an end. Someone introduced Ji Tongling Hongchun Society, with the front and back stages splitting the profits.

<p>The famous French play "The Beginning of Man," also known as "The Elementary School Teacher," has given us a very deep impression on the stage. It exposes the masks of adults and gentlemen, exposes the sinful side of the entire society, and shakes Zhang Bonan's awakening of the heavenly gate. Huaxin Company specially invited Gu Zhongyi to adapt it into a film script, directed by Li Pingqian, renamed "Gold and Silver World," and put it on the screen. It has now been completely filmed and will be released at the New Light Grand Theater on Saturday (the 15th) of this week.</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun and Liu Chongyuan play Miss Xiao and Zhang Bonan respectively, You Guangzhao plays Principal Mu, Bai Hong plays Mu Ailan, and Wang Xianqi plays Guo Canshi. The strong lineup shows the company's emphasis on this film.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Xu Biyun Violates the Taboo of the White Tiger of the Pear Garden</p>
<p>The reasons given by their clan leader are that although gambling and smoking all waste materials and hurt the body, there is a difference in urgency and internality. Gambling is outside the family, and it is not easy for parents to prevent it. Moreover, the gambling in the countryside is either pressing treasures or playing dominoes. As the saying goes, "the collapse of the dominoes family," it only takes one night to lose all the real estate, so the danger to wealth is too great. As for prostitution, it is enough to make people lose their reputation. If prostitutes are brought home, it will inevitably disturb the peace of the whole family and cause disharmony between husband and wife. Although its danger is slightly less than gambling, once it reaches the level of wild prostitution, it will disappear without a trace, and people will not be seen. Things that should be handled cannot be handled. Therefore, compared to the three, smoking is a kind of hobby, and its danger is the smallest. They all smoke in moderation, which not only does not hinder the affairs that the children should handle, but also naturally prompts them to immediately run home when they are addicted, and they will never dare to do anything wrong outside. Furthermore, if they are already addicted to smoking, even if they are allowed to engage in wild prostitution and gambling, they are absolutely unwilling to do so. Since the Meng family rules allow open smoking of opium, of course, the Xiangzi shops such as Ruifuxiang and Ruilinxiang in Peiping and the residence of Meng Siye often have lights on. Biyun is at the Meng family for almost twenty days a month. It is really too difficult for young people to be sure of themselves. Sometimes, after the performance in the restaurant, they feel a little tired, and occasionally smoke one or two pipes, but they don't feel anything. As the days go by, they can't do without it. Singing actors often focus on appearance, and once he develops a habit, the makeup will become more and more ugly day by day. Biyun does not check himself, but seems to be digging his own grave, which is also the biggest reason why he willingly falls. Secondly, he relies on his adoptive father's wealth and loves him very much, so he acts recklessly. Later, he committed adultery and was sentenced to several months of hard labor. Since then, his reputation has been ruined and he has been treated like a person. Although Meng Siye paid to bail him out not long after, he was too embarrassed to perform again in a short period of time. —(58)—</p>

<p>(9) Bang Bang Opera</p>
<p>The first to introduce Bang Bang Opera (Ping Opera) to Shanghai was the Zhu sisters, and the one who made the deepest impression on Shanghai people should be Bai Yushuang.</p>
<p>"Ma Widow's Idle Shop" and "Shooting the Little Old Lady" are Bai Yushuang's representative works. At that time, the recitation of several plots such as "Dreaming Back to the Cross-Legs" and "Undressing and Breastfeeding" far exceeded today's "Luo Luo Li Bo" and "Burning Fire and Sleeping Screen".</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this is a kind of "local small opera" that is not elegant.</p>
