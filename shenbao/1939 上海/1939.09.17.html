<p>「蘇日相處，以不相衝突而茍且相安，為其最高度之邦交，若謂兩國乃得共患難，共陣綫，是謂為違反人性之假想可也。日本何所期乎？蘇聯對於德國由互不侵犯條約而更進一步，結為軍事同盟；根據同盟，蘇德携手作戰於歐洲，於是日本獲得最所理想之機會矣。」（九·九社評）</p>
<p>「至於蘇聯，在彼主義上，政治上，經濟上，軍略上，凡應視為乘除得失之數量者，較他國為複雜：故其政策進返，最難捉摸；亦卽種種作為，種種轉變，最多其不同之可能。……在遠東，至少無求於日本，亦無憚於日本」（同上）</p>
<p>凡右所論，竊信未為蘇日協定而動搖，且以為蘇日協定之一部分意義，甚可追求之於前論。若謂蘇聯別有其更遠大之企圖，則於對日簽訂停止敵對行動協定之外，作進一步之行動，雖亦有其可能。然至今日為止。我人絕不如此假想也。</p>
<p>就蘇日協定論之，未可視為驚人之舉；蓋兩國派大使，訂協定，苟且相安而不相衝突，是乃正常之邦交，自在邦交最高限度內之事，並非意外。且證以去年張鼓峰事件之解決，則此决協定乃為日本對蘇聯之第二决委屈妥協，並非創洌。而日前日本先行撤換駐「滿」首腦，即所以對蘇表示誠悃，礎潤而雨、月暈而風。並非突然。况雙方自五月初旬以來之衝突，其主要內慕乃為德國與日本親德軍人之所共同搬演。徒為德國造就比較有利於結納蘇聯之環境，及至今茲，日本親德夢醒，當然無復支撐蘇日間緊張「塲面」之絲毫理由，由緊張而相安，祇是歛跡，並非開展。於是而論·蘇日協定之本質，固猶平淡之國際動態也。雖然，日本自蘇德締的言歡之後，孤苦特甚，內閣更張，要在修正其國際關係；乃為日無幾，便得消弭對蘇緊張之形態，則協定之後雖無他物，協定本質雖曰平淡，此就日本方面言之，要不能否定其為阿部登台第一功！</p>
<p>抑蘇聯何為而與日本訂此協定？關於蘇聯之一切，我人不欲試加「捉摸」。故當蘇德締的之際，世論多稱蘇聯自此西顧無憂，將致全力於遠東；我人僅以為彼「得」致力於遠東而已，而「是否有所作為，乃另「問題」；然則於彼與日協定停止敵對行動之今日，遽謂蘇聯更將如何如何者，豈不失之過早。總之觀察蘇聯之意響，惟有看一步，知一步，於此尚未舉其第二步之日，我人無自而明瞭其意響。頗有可得而言者：（一）蘇聯頻年作為，頗多為國際所不諒；即如與英法談判於莫斯科，俱見勤勤懇懇，不厭不倦而猝然宣布蘇德立的，於是責難蘇聯者，謂虛誠僞信，不知所可。然以我人之所記憶，所感想，蘇聯於所切實承諾之事，在嚴格之「切實承諾」範圍內，未嘗食言背信。世人大病大誤，乃在錯認蘇聯所虛相委蛇者，或泛論原則原理者，或傾誠相與而未臻成熟未得結論未辦手續者，以為蘇聯旣默契之矣，心許之矣，同意之矣；蘇聯對此，未以為應受拘束，故亦從未違反拘束也。蘇日協定如彼，而中蘇則有互不侵犯條的焉，切實承諾不與他國締結不利中國之條的，切實承諾反對侵略；故蘇日協定當非意在予中國以不利；蘇日協定之後，即使與日別有作為，亦當無所不利於中國之反抗侵略。（二）蘇聯中斷其英法談判而與德國締的，必有其重大意義，而非偶然。今者，英法與德國交戰矣，以目前之階段而推論交戰結果，則雖不慊於英法者亦不能諱言於英法佔優勢，經濟力量使然也。蘇聯本無坐視德國儘量束進之理由，更無容忍德國獨霸歐陸之理由，然亦不願德國一敗塗地；吾則不與英法聯合制而德竟與德國締的，將絕無意義，豈不類於瘋癲。顧乃事實所示，德國先以與蘇締約而在國際有衆叛親離之觀，今以數面受敵而將終於戰敗；英法對德旣佔優勢，而其國內卑怯茍賤之流，更謀誘致日本，以張聲勢；同時，日本在國際，因與蘇聯旣有宿怨，而遭德國遺棄之後，備極孤苦之時，方謀保持其優越之條件而與英法接近：凡此種種，殆為蘇聯所不願坐視消長以放任英法與日本苟合者也。今知日本對蘇聯戒懼獨甚，緣是而對英法愈願相歡，爰於日本改組內閣，希冀釋嫌之會，遽許以締結協定，停止敵對，則謂為有愛於日本，母寗謂為助德國而鼓勵日本以與英法周旋也。藉曰蘇聯無此意念，然其影饗及於客觀之事實者，必為使日本對英法，增進要挾之勇氣無疑！</p>

<p>莫斯科　據可恃方面消息、日本駐蘇大使東鄉、昨與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫晤談四小時、聞此項談話、關於外蒙邊界停戰事者、漸近最後階段、現復有蘇日行將締結互不侵犯條的之謠言、惟此說迄求證實、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　日蘇兩國在「滿」蒙邊界處所成立協定事、此間各國觀察家頃加以評論咸謂、各該國均皆切望决各項懸案、一般關係、自可因而改善、溯自德蘇兩國互不侵犯協定簽字之後、日本大使東鄕即通吿蘇聯政府、謂日本政府願與蘇聯討論各項懸案、以冀成立和平解决方案、迄至此際、日本對於紅軍近在「滿」蒙邊界所進佔之陣地、即蘇聯所認為「滿」蒙眞正界綫所在之地、並無何項異議、此亦該國態度溫和之叉一明證、特日蘇兩國尙當商訂互不侵犯協定之說、至少尙屬言之過早、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　據今日此間消息靈通方面稱、蘇日解决諾蒙亨之衝突、發動於柏林、觀此可知軸心在外交上固仍活動、惟此間日方對於蘇日能吾訂立不侵條的一層、表示懐疑、（十六日美聯社電）</p>
<p>巴爾夏加爾　十六日午前六時、日軍某某司令部下令、在賀隆已依爾曠野之兵士、立時停止攻擊，自此項命令發出後、記者即見有日軍偵察機向南方低飛而過、蘇聯步兵對此亦未發一彈、又蘇聯機械化部隊、是時亦奉命退回紅軍倉庫、故日蘇兩國軍事已歸和好、而互站於本境陣地、蘇兩國之旗均在本國境地上高揭飄揚、（十六日同盟社電）</p>
<p>東京　日外務省情報部長今日下午一時發表談話謂、日政府努力進行解決日蘇間諸懸案、而日蘇兩國政府均認「滿」蒙國境諾蒙亨方面紛爭之解決能除去兩國間之不愉快空氣、並能促進國交之正常化東鄕大使與蘇聯外交人民委員莫洛托夫會見數决、進行談判之結果、至九月十五日、兩國之問成立停戰恊定、（十六日同盟電）</p>
<p>東京　大本營陸軍部本日下午一時發表謂、諾蒙亨方面之外蒙蘇聯軍、曾於八月廿日增加兵力、對日軍陣地之兩側面加以攻擊、日方亦增一部兵力繼續激烈戰鬥、兩方均有相當損失、然至九月、戰事漸歸平靜以後、日蘇兩國當局進行外交交涉、至今日兩方意見一致決定停戰、（十六日同盟電）</p>
<p>東京　此間各報對蘇日成立邊界停戰協定皆表滿意、公債亦一致上漲、據東京日日新聞稱、日首相阿部宣佈與外國調整邦交之後、即電命日本駐蘇大使東鄉與蘇聯尋求解決懸案之道、東鄉奉命後即與蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫簽訂停戰協定、預料大原則決定之後、勘劃邊界委員會不久前往出事地點開會、（十六日美聯電）</p>
<p>重慶　華人各界雖知蘇日兩國在莫斯科進行談判、但兩國停戰協定之簽第一字消息、已引起甚大之疑懼、衆意美國今必極注意蘇日之相親、蓋日本得在亞洲自由行動、或將更侵犯美國在遠東之權益也、或謂該協定之成立、不致影響蘇聯之援助中國、蓋往日張鼓峯停戰協定成立後、蘇聯仍繼續援助中國也、中國政界目前對此未有評論此事早在意料中、因日人急欲淸理邊界戰事、俾專心從事對華也、華人各界現正殷待繼續發展之消息、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國官方對於蘇日「滿」蒙邊境停戰之協定、在未獲更詳確之條件前、不願發表意見、按蘇日此决妥恊、由於日方以對華作戰、支出已鉅、不願與蘇聯再有何種糾紛、故其發生、不能視爲突如其來、二則日本頗欲乘歐戰之機會、做一批好生意、故始與蘇聯簽一和約、藉以刺激其對外貿易、美國官方預料日方不久或更將與美成立新恊定、至於蘇聯因圖有事波蘭、故亦樂意與日本成立停戰協定、（十六日美聯電）</p>
<p>紐約　日蘇兩國在「滿蒙邊境成立停戰協定之後、此間各晨報、咸以蘇聯政策是吾擴大歐洲戰事為世界大戰為言、紐約泰晤士報載稱、「或謂蘇聯與日本成立協定、乃欲預防德國前進過遠、又有一說、則謂日蘇兩國成立協定、實乃德蘇兩國成立互不侵犯條的之當然的結果、德蘇日三國、或且成立協定、作為歐洲各國從新分野之第一步、我國參議員波拉、甫會與昨夜發表演說、主張美國應置身於歐洲戰事之外、又安知此種戰事、已使全世界之半蒙其影響」、民聲講壇報則以莫測高深爲言、略謂、「蘇聯紅軍對於東歐洲慾望如何、吾人倘不能加以揣測、則日本究在何種情勢之下與蘇聯言和、即亦無從明瞭之、質言之、日本與蘇聯言和、目標何在、非俟蘇聯有所舉動之後、不易知之、」（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　日蘇兩國在滿蒙邊境成立停戰協定事、頃由此間政界人士加以評論、咸謂此乃「意料中事」、各該國且當在短時期內、成立互不侵犯條的（十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>柏林　柏林政界人士對於蘇日兩國締結解决滿蒙邊釁之恊定、表示歡迎、猶憶里賓特羅甫外長於簽締德蘇互不侵犯協約時宜稱、締結此的不惟對於德日之友誼、亦有裨益、德人希望此為蘇日和恊之初步、蘇日兩國間之諒解、當可由此導成、（十六日海通電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯仍為　歐局中之巨謎　陸軍動員用意難測　蘇日停戰益滋疑猜</h3>
<p>倫敦　據路透社外交訪員聲稱、蘇聯今仍為目前歐洲大局中之巨謎、蘇蘇聯於拒絕土英兩國所作締結互助協定之提供後、與德國締結互不侵犯協定時、一般人相信蘇聯之出此、係求在遠東可目由行動、而免有西顧之憂、但此後時事變遷甚速、今蘇聯忽以與日本締結停戰協定聞矣、衆意此舉之後、或繼以互小侵犯協定、俾莫斯科無後顧之憂、而得於歐洲方面自由行動、亦非完全出人意料之事、蘇聯將如何利用此種自由、此為今日一大問題、最近莫斯科眞理報曾載一文、調波蘭之烏克蘭人與白俄羅斯人共的一千萬名、素受虐待云云、隱含蘇聯將對波蘭有所要求之意、該報並提出兩種可能性如下、（一）蘇聯或曾與德國訂有風分波蘭協定、（二）莫斯科因見德軍在波蘭獲勝迅速、而為驚惶、今或在準備如德軍推進過遠、則即提出對波蘭某某區土地之要求、蘇聯之動員陸軍四百萬名、以求實行上舉二者之一、大可視爲蘇聯已出全力以備萬一、德國對於蘇聯之態度、似亦處於黑暗之中、而為俶擾不安、正與世界餘處相同、訪員之意、蘇日之停戰、當可使日人專心致志以處理中國事件、惟日本對此停一戰協定是否深信不疑、而敢稍撤其駐於蘇蒙邊界之大軍三十萬名、以加入對華戰事、仍為一般人聚訟之點、蘇日兩國彼此之猜疑、謂其一宿即能化為鳥有、未可遽信、即蘇德關係、亦可以此為言、甚至更為信實、總之、蘇日停戰協定之簽字、並未澄清大局、徒使人增一新惶惑耳、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　日蘇兩國在「滿」蒙邊境成立停戰協定事、此間政界人士頃加以評論、咸謂、蘇聯所由願將拖延五閱月之敵對狀况予以結束者、乃因該國過問歐洲事件、較為積極所致、日本所保守之中立、縦屬暫時性質、蘇聯亦可乘此機會、轉移視線、以應付西陲現行局勢、日蘇聯係緩和、雖當歸功于德蘇互不侵犯協定、但國社主義所謂基本原則、並無固定性質、又可于此獲一明證、日德兩國之簽訂共產國際公約、旣與種族主義之原則相違反、而德蘇兩國之締結互不侵犯協定、又與反共產主義之原則相抵觸、時至今日、簽字于反共產國際公約之日本竟與素稱第一敵國之蘇聯、釋嫌言好、則所謂蘇聯在遠東之活動、乃係日本對華作戰原因之一、未知何以自圓共說云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　關於中立法修正問題、羅斯福總統決於本月二十一日召集國會臨時會議之後、贊成與反對兩派人士、茲已開始辯論、共和黨參議員波拉、頃在此間發表演說、反對廢止軍火禁運條款、其論據有二、（一）廢止軍火禁運條款、顯屬有利於英法各國、未免有違中立之義、（二）政府此所作為、不在設法維護和平、而在竭力援助英法各國、循是以往、美國勢必捲入戰爭漩渦、但某某報立即加以反駁、略謂、軍火貿易、若果視為違反中立、則其他用於戰爭之各種貨物、如銅、棉花、煤油、等、亦當在禁運之列、且波拉演詞中、故意將孤立派與「和平派」混為一談、並指主張修正中立法之人為「主戰派」、此其用意、顯在混淆輿論、使其相信美國之修正中立法、乃係趨向戰爭之途、但以實際而論、德國苟非出以某種行動以激怒美國輿論、則美國決不致加入作戰、此在政界人士則謂、觀於波拉之演詞、可見渠不欲以理智勝人、徒事刺激國人情感、此外、共和黨參議員奈埃亦反對廢止軍火禁運條款、以為准許軍火運往各交戰國之後、各軍火商人與各財閥、行將資為利藪、而以信用放款畀予各交戰國、結果可使美國加入作戰、以維護此項投資之安全、至共和黨參議員范登堡之反對軍火出口、基於內政理由、緣渠主張為該黨利益計、必須反對羅斯福總統所推行之全部政策、質言之、一切問題即使不在政黨爭執範圍之內、但羅斯福總統若有所主張、亦須加以反對云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>閩省戰時糧食代用品　番藷乾產銷概况　連城縣產量最豐</h3>
<p>福州通訊、連城為閩西重鎭、地處永·寗·汀·杭·龍·中心、工路縱橫腹地、交通甚為便利、手工業以紙為輸出大宗、農村經濟之盛衰、胥以此為轉移、農產品則以稻為主、其决卽番藷、此為該縣主要副糧食、可製成番藷干、聞名八閩、茲將其產銷槪况略述之、</p>
<p>一番薯之栽殖及每年收穫數量、番藷干之製造原料、卽為番藷、亦名山薯、有稱為地瓜者實誤、蓋地瓜雖與番藷同科、而乃另一種塊根植物、亦可切片曬乾、惟該縣所產甚少、所聞名者、卽番藷干也、番藷除可製干外、可蒸食·炒食·或製造麵類糰子、或磨成粉末、為烹調之用、或製成粉條、煮熟充飢、且可製燒酒、又可為家畜之良好飼料、卽莖葉亦可供飼料之用、甘藷之繁殖、普通採取塊根發芽之莖為苗、以行列揷植、其方法有三、茲分述如决、（一）揷苗　先將土鋤鬆、繼之施肥掘穴、然後揷苗、苗揷入之深淺、則視士質而異、土質硬者宜淺、鬆者宜較深、一般言　土不宜深耕、卽三四寸卽足、過深、則塊根成綑條狀、不能擴展、售價亦减低倘遇黏土則宜稍深、至七八寸、方能適其生育、本縣栽培此物、常在高畦、一以防水、一為便於收穫、（二）拔苗、於苗床內種藷、如氣候適宜、則五六天內、卽能生芽長蔓、候生長至七八寸、卽生有根珠、便可移植、移植時、將根蘸以泥漿、以防乾燥、惟拔苗時、切不可移動根块、拔後、隨卽灌水、使土壞濕潤而附着、二三週後、卽能重出幼芽、為繁殖之用、此拔苗移植之法也、（三）揷蔓、有所謂揷蔓法者、卽如上法所種之藷苗、不數十日、則生長茂盛、可截取其莖、為揷植之用、此法最普遍</p>
<p>栽植時期、固因各地氣候不同而互異、惟一般均在廢曆端午節後十日至六月底行之、收穫則在十月底、至十一月間、收穫時、先刈取莖葉然後掘取之、至產量隨氣侯之寒暖、土地之肥瘠、施肥之多寡、大有差異、少者每畝不過十担、多者可收四十担、該縣因米糧不足、故各地均普遍栽植、據二十七年度之調查、全縣產額、共的四萬担、用之製造甘藷干者、尙不及十分之二也、</p>
<p>二·番藷干之製法、本縣所產之甘薯干、其製法有二、茲分述如下、（一）整塊之製法、取紅饀白皮番藷洗凈、置蒸籠中蒸之、俟蒸熟後、取出刮去其皮、以手壓平成塊、然後再放入竹籠中、用微火焙乾後、卽成紅番藷干、（二）切條之製法、取紅饀白皮番藷洗凈去皮、切成條塊、置蒸籠中蒸之、俟蒸熟後、取出以陽光曬干、然後再用木甑蒸之、必須經數度之蒸曬、便成黑紅色之甘藷干、上述兩種製法、以整塊製法較為普遍、輸出境外者亦多、</p>
<p>三·番藷干之性質及用途、番藷干之製法有二、已於前述、論其性質、則整塊者色黃而美觀、味甜、形如合指掌狀、切條者則色褐、味比成塊者更甜、質極軟、富膠性、兩種均易於消化、而其最大用途、則在代替糧食、於身體有益而無損、</p>
<p>四·貯藏方法、整塊與切條之番藷干、貯藏之方法、各有不同、茲分述於决、（一）整块之貯藏法、初製成者、因銷售商人、欲維持其重量、故焙不甚乾、貯藏至二日卽發霉、（色白）久之則腐敗、蓋其常含大量水分也、倘欲使之耐久、則須於街坊購回時、再加微火焙乾、至無含水分止、日後取食時、置飯甑中蒸之、其味及色澤均無變異、（二）切條之貯藏法、此種較整塊者耐於久藏、因其經數度之蒸曬、水分完全為澱粉所吸收、而蒸發成膠質、故祇放於甕中密封、卽無腐敗之虞矣、</p>
<p>五·製造成本及其成品價格、甘藷因栽植甚易、而收穫極豐、故成本微、售價亦賤、查去年冬收成時期、（舊歷十月底至十一月中旬）每角可買二十斤、每市擔僅費國幣五角、收成完畢後、價格始漸昇漲、採製番藷干者、均在收成期卽大批購入貯藏、以待製造、從事此種製造工作者、多屬婦女、平均每天每人僅可製十斤至十五斤、販賣價格、在冬季每角一斤春季則漲至每斤二角五分、據調查每百斤番藷、可製干二十斤、每斤以一角計算、可售兩元、除原料五角、工資五角、燃料雜費以及器皿之損壊亦以五角計算外、尙可盈餘五角、收益頗厚、際茲抗戰時期、倘能普遍提倡增加產量、則不獨可以充裕人民財力、且可以增加戰時糧食、如用作行軍乾糧允宜、此對於抗戰建國不無裨益、關心糧食問題者、宜注意及之、</p>
<h3>戰爭邊沿的香港　由危急而緩和的局勢　逃難的羣衆來往頻繁</h3>
<p>香港通信、日本對華侵略、旣無法結束、叉無力支撑、在此階段中、乃思與英國為難、妄想逼使英國一面不再援助中國、一面和英國「合作」、再一面迫使英國出來壓迫中國政府接受議和、於是乎天津英租界遭受封鎖、淪陷區復有反英運動、最後、日軍更在香港邊界陳師鞠旅、予英國在中國的唯一根據地以直接的威脅、這是上月二十日後的事情、在這種情况下、英國人表面鎭靜、肚裏却非常明白、所以除派出大批軍隊開赴新界增防、並在中英邊界挖掘戰壕、將深圳織橋一下炸斷之外、同時又公開勸吿居民能疏散的自動疏散、不能疏散的儲備糧食、以備不虞、此外更作種種必要的準備、如全港陸海空軍協同部署立體防禦、鯉魚門汲水門施行封鎖、以至頒佈國防法令、舉行郵電檢查等、不一而足、在此時期、香港的危機、大有一髮千鈞之勢、可是霹靂一聲、德蘇兩國簽訂互不侵犯協定、日本遂受到一意外嚴重的打擊、以致手忙脚亂、而第一個要著、似乎便是趕快掉轉頭來、向英國討好、這樣、深圳方面的形勢、漸漸地復趨緩和、香港的危機、就是這樣地過去了、</p>
<p>但是德波形勢的惡化、香港的外僑、最先撤退、中國人之繼之離港、或上雲南、或赴上海、沒錢的也不能不作必要的準備、於是有的儲糧、有的存柴、有的趁輪船到澳門、有的更索性逃到淪陷區、三四天內、香港居然逃跑了一兩萬人、等到德波戰爭正式爆發、香港的空氣、更加緊張、成千成萬的人、都從水道逃到上海·澳鬥·以及廣州、其中以逃澳門·廣州的為特別多、而更有錢的、則往菲列濱那方面走、最後剩下那些不能即逃或沒處可逃的、也都趕緊儲糧買薪、米柴之外、罐頭食品、牛乳·麥片·餅亁·鹹魚·麵條。之類、價格立刻飛漲、提存款。領護照·問航期·定艙位·這一類工作、自然也急得如同救火、所以兩日之內、香港的社會、形成混亂的景象、</p>
<p>可是挨兩天挨過了、局勢似乎在一度動盪之後、又趨安定了、日本宣佈「不干涉歐洲政策」、不啻給香港人吃了一顆定心丸、而事實上確也如此、只要日本不和德義一致動作、香港便可站在戰爭的外邊、雖然自九一以來、香港當局的戰事準備、十分妥當、等到九月七日、除開物價略為高漲、商業略受影響外、其他方面、簡直已經看不出有什麽「戰色」、於是乎打算逃難的人不再想逃、撤退了的外僑、也有一部份重新回來、更有趣的、是一方面還有人絡續逃到澳門去、一方面澳門都有人絡續逃回來、原因是澳門地狹人衆、無論如何也容納不下那麼多的「香港難民」、所以逃去的大半租不到房子、同時澳門用的是銀毫（廣東舊銀毫）和港幣、在平時、一元港幣可換到十四角上下、所以澳門的生活程度比香港低、但是歐戰一發生、銀毫的價格不斷上漲、港幣一元、旣換不滿十個毫子、那裏的物便、比香港貴得更快、所以逃去的人、不得不依舊逃回來、沒有逃去而打算逃去的、有的欲行而止、有的却一定要到澳門嘗一嘗逃難的滋味、這樣、每天行走于港澳之間的五艘輪船、無論來去、都宣吿客滿、</p>

<h3>吳江黎里鎭　華軍計擒偽軍　二百餘人悉繳械</h3>
<p>蘇州通訊、駐於吳江黎里鎭之華軍某部、近因偽軍狡猾異常、難施攻擊、為實行痛剿計、乃於八日假降、當時吳江僞軍司令謝志俊、信以為眞、見華軍有意接洽、隨派所部僞軍二百餘人、中隊長一人、前往黎里、冀圖收編、詎華軍見僞軍率大隊前來、即預伏該鎭附近、迨偽軍登陸時、一聲號令、四出包圍、僞軍始知中計、但已不及準備、於是高呼、「中國人不打中國人」均願携械歸順、華軍某長官、以該偽軍反覆無常、不允收編、當時繳獲之槍械呈報上峯、對俘獲之僞軍、逼令遣散、以免再擾地方、</p>

<h3>金融　港帮出外滙買黃金　午後非正式價昂達四二六〇元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、雖外滙趨勢穩中帶硬、金價則繼續上進、蓋因香港帮塞出外匯、而轉套進黃金、故近日來金價與外滙遂背道而馳、故較外滙結價稍見軋攏、但照午收核算、尙撳低七百八十二元八角至一千一百九十六元八角之鉅、惟當日情勢晨開尙平、仍為四千一百三十元、開後因客帮吸胃大健、價即一哄至四千　百二十元高峯、此後因某余號與銀樓帮等趁高均有賣胃、　錢兌業等逢小即來吸收、雙方互相擯持、故價即鮮少變化、盤旋於四千二百兀內外、結果午收以四千一百九十元較上日又軋漲六—元、午後因週六無市、但塲外市勢更堅、據聞非正式價、竟昂達四千二百六十元光景、半天交易暢旺、的千兩光景、銀樓　金共掛大十五元、海關金與中英純金等已呈刻板狀態、</p>
<p>粭赤市價猛抬</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開尙平、九點十分開市、錢兌業互做　兩、價仍四千一百三十元、俄錢兌業買意興當、加之港帮復託證券帮猛吸、且一時售者絕跡、致漲勢驟熾、一剎那飛升九—元、證券帮進錢兌業及銀樓帮共三十兩、均為四千二百二十元、時某金號與某銀樓均來趁高塞出、且聞外匯峪硬、買者轉少、故立回落四十元、某金號售予錢兌業二十兩、價為四千一百八十元、後錢兌業續代本地帮吸購、遂復抬高三十元、錢兌業進銀樓帮三十兩、為四千二百十元、此後現金號忽來吐出、且銀樓帮續有賣胃、致價頓又回挫四十元、銀樓帮塞予錢兌業證券帮各十兩、價均為四千一百七十元、未幾突又升騰、銀樓帮互做二十兩、價為四千二百元、午刻復稍回下、銀樓帮吐予錢兌菜二十兩、為四千一百九十元作午收價、比前日再漲六十元、查已連漲六天、共升四百〇五元、上半日有九十元高低、不脫盤局、下午交割無市、聞塲外香港帮進胃忽强、價已升至四千二百六十元、現金號之本牌金、售價照烚赤高十元、收進照售價低五十元、現標金收售照牌低六十餘元、求聞成交、</p>
<p>飾金高懸四百卅元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、亦隨之步升不止、大同行初掛四百十五元、九點三十分一躍升十元、為四百二十五允、下午三點又升五元、為四百三十元、新同行亦步升至四百二十八元、（收進减二十元左右、）</p>
<h3>金鎊達百元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣以匯市益鮮變幻、故英美金票亦毫無上落、然金價步漲未已、資富者對金鎊則頗有需求、故漲勢殊勁、前者已昂達百元大關、後者已越白元關外、結果各升四元、法郞票亦大一分、新加坡蔡升一角、荷蘭票漲五角、日金票漲勢復盛、一度曾到一元三角三分半、卒為一元三角三分，結果漲起四分五厘、朝鮮票升二分五厘、惟安南票尙跌二角、餘尙平穩、</p>
<h3>現鈔供過於求　貼現績降</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、仍在盤低中、乃現鈔供過終求池、每千元初在一百二十五元左右盤旋、繼退至一百二十二元、近午回上至一百二十五元、下午一度低至一百十七元、終為一百　十元、比上日再低二元半、錢業公會拆息、仍掛二角云、</p>
<h3>英金鬆動美滙平</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗市、因美英滙兌慘落不已、竟再暴縮五分、業已退達三元八角八分、故晨開局勢、續吿英平美緊、計英金仍為四辦士〇一五六二五、美滙則降至六元四三七五、唯中途情况至為沉悶、交易十分淸閒、蓋業者均靜觀待變、允因近日來物價飛漲、一般素來投機於滙市者、亦多捨此就彼、故衆業股票市塲、進出大旺、惟結果因港帮略有套賣、故午收英金硬至四辦士〇三一二五、美滙回平至六元半、比上日英稍帶硬、美則無榮辱、本月期貨趨勢與現貨相若、</p>
<p>美英互滙再縮</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期漲六二五、遠期長五六二五、紐的銀價升二五、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·對滬。對法均平、（有行無市）、美對英又暴落五分、對滬跌三角、對法小一分半、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士〇一五六二五、美滙六元四六八七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃滙兌降落之故、開後某行吸進同行現貨美滙六元半、為狀頗平、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大三分半、此後港帮託掮客稍來吐出現貨英金、並華商亦略有拋塞、但英行滙豐等吃胃尙佳、是以鬆勢極微、計巷帮吐予滙豐等外行現貨英金四辦士〇三二二五及〇六二五、兼華商塞予外行現貨美滙六元半、此後成交益少、過程更無精彩、將近午刻、外行對於現貨美滙六元半、頗有賣胃、迨至午牧、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士〇三一二五、美滙六元半、本月份英金四辦士、美滙六元四三七五、結果比上日現期英均微　〇一五六二五、美則無榮辱、午後週六無市、</p>

<h3>證券　內債起伏　範圍較鉅　外股市氣蓬勃</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、先疲後堅、回上後似又無力、蓋始終未能脫盤旋局面、不過高低差額、比日前稍形擴大、前在五分一角間盤旋者、昨有三四角上落、丙種在四十三元內外盤旋、查自九月二日起至今、未說離此種狀况、昨又有日蘇對滿蒙成立停戰協定之消息、市塲對於此舉、朱有肯定認議、昨日各帮買賣依然淸淡、大別之、丙種較堅、戊種較疲、市塲人氣尙屬穩定、一日市價結果、仍屬高低互見、爲數祇五分一角至二角而已、成交總數的三十萬元左右、下週一為紀念日、停市一天、茲列簡表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗廠有減工趨勢　棉紗大漲小回　雙馬曾開八百六十元　十支得利漲五十五元</h3>
<p>紗市益呈猛進疾退之勢、情况異常在暴、蓋以市上傳說紛紜、大部份心理謂原棉售　旣昂、而存底日竭、外洋定價愈貴、存棉不足之廠、深恐有减工之虞、將後生產必弱、英商兩家已實行三日班、於是一來買者若在、開盤一鬨、二十支雙馬會達八百六十元之新紀錄、一霎間因獲利者出籠、迅速回下三十元、棧單價之升降、高峯到七百八十五元、回小至七百五十五元、此種狀况、使人驚愕膽寒也、香港對於十支粗紗需要允殷、故粗紗漲力愈强、十支得利飛騰五十五元之巨也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因印棉來電在升十餘羅比、惟美棉平平、市上人心熱烈、達於極點、開價燮馬一跳五十七元、惟現貨校緩、漲二三十元、少頃因連朝猛漲、引起獲利者出檔、而回小二三十元、收盤平平、查半日間成交統計九百六十包、上日成交三百包、申新二廠上日開出二十支天女證實、本日又開出五百包、價為八百元、每包收定洋一百元、行情二十支雙馬漲十六元、雙地球漲二十六元、天女漲二十八元、醒獅跳七十元、牧羊漲三十六元、十支雙地球漲二十五兀、得利漲五十五元、出口棉紗昨有四百八十件運寗波、今日尙有七十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<h3>通花索價　一百六十元</h3>
<p>現棉交易、連朝發展、且各廠搜羅殷切、市上之手貨、日見售罄、至於海外定價殊昂、本日美棉氣勢雖平疲、然印棉因存貨减縮、而內地到貨薄弱、故塊角驟騰、四五月期白洛去橫跳十七雜比、暗盤來電續升十羅比、於是人心更挺、賣價節節前進、通花價再漲七元、印棉三二十支原料已做到一百九十七元至二百元、通州花品質優勝之貨索價要一百六十元、據市塲消息、耳聞外廠因原料難覓，業有减工動議之說、蘇北來源、計通花到五六百包、又北沙來八百五十包、出口有一百九十包運香港、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>上日美種彭浦花、價為一百八十元、誤載白洛去、附此紏正</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、因滬埠存底日枯、因之售價奇緊、同業間尚不願脫手、一部份廠方、目覩此淸、業已開始冋洋行方面訂購新棉、惟船期殊為遙遠、俱在九十月間、日來已有售出數萬包之夥、交易者大都皆係日廠商、一般預料、美棉交易將轉鼎盛、印度市價將繼續飛騰也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初因受買方之壓力、市况殊為活躍、開盤時激漲六七磅音、續後因大衆之拋賣及南方　買頗為猛烈、因之市况下落、結果牧盤價格較之昨日跌去五六磅音、印度棉市因輸入困難、產地存底不豐、因之市價飛漲、咋日連同預測猛跳十八羅比、埃及棉市較爲靜寂、略漲七八磅音、利物浦漲起二十餘磅音、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉麥鬆澆</h3>
<p>粉市略鬆、因值週末之期、本客交易、均無特殊進展、且自近來日廠出品在市傾銷以來、一部份客帮、均樂予購取、故廠粉頗受打擊、昨回籠貨以囤戶實銷均吿平淡、業已鬆疲角許、價開七元二角半至三角、廠盤則仍開七元二角現鈔、暫鮮變動、今後市面、當以實銷如何為轉移、十七日有粉一萬六千二百包運香港、</p>
<p>小麥、續呈供過於求之態連日各地來源、絡繹不絕、各廠進胃尙佳、而行囤去化、則已逐漸怠懈、目下高貨售主尙思扳持、中决麥則已步鬆、統市僅由福新阜豐兩廠合辮蘇常鎭揚及蕪湖等麥共六千餘包、價十元〇〇）五分至九元五角半、高麥囤戶觀望、擯持乏交、市面亦難振奮、</p>
<h3>粳秈續降　糯米平定</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源河下叉無到貨而車輪包子來嘉善嘉興及崑蘇等新貨三四千包、大局市面自早市開手、尙有一些隔昨餘波、人心續佳、各貨價又圖喊高、後因銷塲轉懈、致呈供過於求、形勢即疲、各貨行情逐見回跌、結果無論粳尖悉降半元至一元半、若特錫粳四十三元、高四十一二元、决至四十元、蘇同崑粳叫十一元至四十元、河下早晚稻三十五元、决至三十三元、原包三十八元至三十七元半、蘇崑新羊尖初開二十九元二三角、後落至二十八元七角至二十八元半、楓涇菱白尖以新鮮品、價開二十九元半、嘉興嘉善新羊尖二十九元至二十八元二三角、團尖二十九元至二十八元半、蕪尖陳貨反不若新貨熱路、故祇開二十七元、新尖初開二十八元、後至二十七元半、决者二十六七元，江北新尖二十八元至二十七元半、變元三十七八元洋糯高三卞八元半三十八元、統計全市成交數五千來包而已、</p>
<p>另訊、昨晨客秈趁前晨漲風、且以被阻各米放後、成本加重、故貨方售價一度喊高五六角至一元、乃進戶嫌昂觀望、而行囤亦擬乘機趕脫、市乃站而復疲、後市賣氣允旺、價乃步小一元左右、比之前市反小半元左右、高江北秈二十八元、高蕪秈二十八元半、中决自二十七元至二十五元左右云、</p>
<h3>糖市　囤戶續出　洋糖仍軟</h3>
<p>昨洋糖因囤戶續有吐出、仍屬平疲之局、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧降至五十七元三角、外棧最小到過五十六元半、市略好為七十七元、轉口四十五元、太古車白初平後軟、由六十二元降至六　一元八角、後為六十一元二角、其餘CW嘜等照退、H嘜車赤四十五元二角、荷赤現貨四十六元、轉口一二十九元、均小一元、本綿白振記一號五十七元、二號五十六元半、三號五十六元、四號五十五元半、本一號冰六十六元半、晶明冰六十八元、國糖趨勢仍堅、無成交、惟昨日有糖三千包運往寗波、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油頻漲</h3>
<p>豆油銷塲、港方係因匯水關係、未見續辦、（花生油亦未開）、但在環境之驅馳下、一般搶帽子式之囤戶、活躍非常、致行悄逐向新高峯挺進、昨市再漲一二元、「神戶油又復出六十元大關、（開六十元零八角）、上月二十二日之最高紀錄、（六十一元）、勢必打破、統市成交大連油三十桶、神戶油一百二十桶、叉五十聽、天津油十桶、又一百六十五聽、膠州油二十件、靑岐油一百二十件、行情均詳市價欄、至出口油、今日有生油六百九十件、運往香港、</p>
<p>豆子十六日自北沙來七百包、十七日運香港二千八百五十包、花生生仁十七日運香港六百五十包，</p>

<p>出口、十六日運往寗波疋頭五百二十件、十七日運香港三百七十件、運海防一百六十件、</p>
<h3>大衣呢　下擋缺俏</h3>
<p>大衣呢市面、邇來奇形佾貴、蓋到源缺乏、所結匯票俱在四辦士左右、致成本頗昂、下檔大路普通大衣呢、往年售五六元一碼者、現大都漲售十元一碼、此種厚貨內外棧存底極缺、市氣因之特別軋俏、查嗣後到貨、（一）因同業中大半拍電緩裝、（二）因歐戰船來有限、（三）為付稅被迫使用一華興」鈔票、成本扯價又增、致人心堅固、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經交易不旺</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、紐的近期漲丸分半遠期漲一角三分、現貨日絲各漲三分、橫濱漲十元、遠期漲七十五元、然本埠洋行進貨並不活躍、蓋因邇來日美絲價騰漲過劇、且覺飄忽故也、美銷輯里經六個號子咋開一千九百允、計較高盤已跌去一百五十元、白廠B字廠商持價為四千三百元、聞少成文昨祇售開輯里四　五担、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新湘蓮　開升十餘元</h3>
<p>湘蓮見新以來、本湖蓮最小價曾破百元大關、比首盤須跌三分之一强、終以來源難劃而到稀、價乃轉機、昨已開升十餘元、為一百十元、市象漸穩、</p>
<h3>頂荘金針菜</h3>
<p>金針菜邇來稍見轉機、而上莊好貨允覺堅俏、頂莊曾達五十元之高價、茲復開至五十二元、惟中下之貨、升度僅二三元之上落、</p>
<h3>五金　同業囤戶搜購　貨價頻漲不已</h3>
<p>五金貨價連日　　不已、因歐洲貨已無法裝來、而能獨占本埠五金市塲者、惟美貨而已、惜船舶不多、運費上漲、兵險增加、目廠方迭决漲價、同業無法定貨、嗣後五金到貨必定稀少、同業及外行爭購、囤戶吸收囤積居奇、致各貨行情飛漲、昨價二十四號大馬口鐵每箱開一千元、二十六號開五百元、正號雙速馬口鐵一百磅開二百四十元、九十磅開二百二十元、會司鐵一百七十元、自鉛皮七百五十元、靑鉛一百二十元、本廠釘六十元、黑鐵坯子一千元、新鉛絲九十元、白鉛絲五十元、均比前價暴漲一二成不等、</p>
<h3>竹節鋼條　售盤亦高</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條銷路、向以本街建築帮為最大、客帮去路殊缺、天津因洪水成澤國、當無進辦之意、靑島烟台諸帮亦因船期與封鎖關係、大致未動手採辦、華南諸帮雖略有點綴、但為數十分單薄、故該貨唯一之依靠者、祗本埠一隅而已、查其開價、只見日高一日、刻市如三分至四分每噸售七百六十元、五分至一寸每噸售七百十元云、附其他市價於後、（單位元）</p>
<h3>藥材　良羗又吿飛漲</h3>
<p>良羗分大中小三種、目下產區因為某方把持、須先結買外滙方允出口、且船資外費等均奇昂、故申市號方存貨不得不再喊高、現市較前盤須漲十四五元之多、况漢口帮正在動辦、後市當有續升之望、查統市實存的僅三四百件之譜、</p>
<h3>進出口　歐貨近有來滬</h3>
<p>近日來滬貨物、前由意國蓮來綪三千三百六十一塊、又二百件、呢絨二百五十箱、顏料卅件、惟人造絲三十五件、則轉天津、前日（十三日）有洋米五千零七十九包、由香港運來、豆子三百七十包、由北沙運來、又（十四日）出口之貨則有豆子二千一百五十包、運往香港、又七百七十包、運厦門、豆油五十件、亦運厦門、運往香港豆油亦有一百件、又有生仁七百包、生油一千九百九十聽運去、</p>

<h3>美赫德大將返滬後　正注視局勢發展　與總領高斯謀審愼應付　滬西交涉傳已吿一段落</h3>
<p>歐戰爆發後、日方乘機對兩租界施行壓迫、六日要求英法撤退在華駐軍、八日支持僞警、開始侵入越界築路，十三日要求各國駐滬防軍司令、變更防區、日海軍發言人六日對西報記者所謂「將依决採用必要步驟」、業已逐一演出、因之滬上局勢、日趨嚴重、工部局雖已與日方進行越界築路交涉、但日方行動、方與未艾、美國亞洲艦隊司令赫德大將、以對遠東問題、美國政府曾賦予廣泛之權力、乃甫於由滬返抵靑島之後、復奉命遽乘其私人快艦伊沙佩爾號於前晨十一時三十分抵滬、與各方接觸、應付嚴重局勢、預料一二日內、必有重大發展、茲誌詳細情形於後、</p>
<p>赫德行動極堪重視</p>
<p>美國駐華大使詹森、遠在重慶、不擬來滬、關於遠東問題及上海問題、美國政府及詹森大使、乃賦予駐節靑島之美國亞洲艦隊司令赫德大將、及駐滬總領事高斯、以廣泛之權力、囑令密切注意事態之發展、凡任何事件、涉及美國在滬權益或足以削弱美國在遠東之植利者、由兩氏秉承政府一貫的外交政策、與英法各國駐滬官員、保持接觸、審愼應付、聞赫德大將前日抵滬後、即日下午、曾訪高斯氏聽取各種情報、交換意見、對日方要求變更防區之建議、並將提出一對案、供各國駐滬防軍司令之參考、各國駐滬當局、對應付當前種種困難問題、亦惟美國馬首是瞻、故赫德行動、極可重視、</p>
<p>日方覬覦英軍防區</p>
<p>日海軍陸戰隊司令宍戶、召集英美查各國駐防軍司令會議、要求調整駐軍防區後、闡北方面、即盛傳日方將仿效北江西路至北四川路一帶辦法、將北江西路以西至北西藏路一帶、加以封鎖、置於日方統制之下、區內居民、均由日方限期發給通行證、並在自來水橋·天后宮橋·山西路橋·福建路橋·老垃圾橋·新拉圾橋、由日方派兵檢查通行證及防疫證等、查北英駐軍防區、此說確否、暫時雖無從證實、但與日方企圖接收英防區之傳聞、有若空谷來風、似非無因、</p>
<p>美電台播無稽消息</p>
<p>大陸報云、美國金門廣播電台昨（十五日）夜發新聞廣播時曾稱、上海英軍當局已接得撤離滬西英軍防區一個月之令等語、本埠聆此廣播消息者、大為震驚、惟已證明此說盡屬無稽、蓋旋加探詢、英日當局均斷然吾認之也、日海軍發言人亦以英大使館發言人所稱「此說完全不確」一語為然、按金門廣播電台於不足兩週內、已屬第三决廣播不確消息、前兩决傳美當局鑒於日方向上海公共租界提要求而造成「緊急」狀態、已派美第六陸戰隊開滬、及法軍在西綫作戰之第二日、已衝破德國西格斐防錢、</p>
<p>費利浦曾訪傳筱閹</p>
<p>關於越界築路問題交涉、記者前日即聞工部局總裁兼總辦費利浦、將於是日與日方代表會見、繼續進行交涉之說、昨晨業已證實、是日下午、費氏確與日方代表會見、以私人資格就一般問題、交換意見、但尙未得具體結果、昨日日方報紙記載、宣傳費氏前日下午三時曾赴市中心區訪僞市長傳筱庵、對滬西越界築路問題、作五十分鐘談話、已有「圓滿之解決」、但工部局發言人對此、尙不擬加以評論、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據日文大陸新報載稱、工部局總辦費利浦、昨日（十五日）午後三時在市中心區「市府」辦公室與「市長　傳筱庵會談五十分鐘、結果界外馬路問題、已有滿意的解決之望云、今日（十六日）聞費氏對此、尙不準備發表任何言論、</p>
<p>滬西刦機傳有背景</p>
<p>前日傍晚七時許、靜安寺路捕房華捕三人在曹家渡五角塲附近巡邏時、手槍三支被刦、外間遂多巡捕被繳械之傳說、茲據附近居民稱、此事發生於是晚七時十分、當華捕三人在極司非而路上巡行時、忽有十六人、在極司非而路康腦脫路轉角衝出、將三人包圍、三人奮身格鬥、以衆寡懸殊、所佩手槍、卒被刦去、暴徒見目的旣達、即向道傍賭窟區域潛逃無蹤、捕房據報、即開到鐵甲車二輛、加以搜查、但並無所獲、此事今發生於多事之越界築路、而暴徒公然結隊持械橫行、且所持武器、係毛瑟槍及盒子砲、各方咸認此舉必有背景、</p>
<p>捕房昨日開始戒備</p>
<p>海格路四四八號（地豐路西）林氏巨厦、自十三日由日憲兵及僞警侵佔後、積極從事布置、一方面將沿路舊有鉛絲網、完全拆除、一方面雇工修理房屋、連日工作、甚形忙碌、昨日復在大門及側門前堆置沙袋、加築防禦工事、駐守門首之僞警、一部份將槍枝架於沙堆上、作放射式、形勢略見嚴重、捕房方面、昨日起亦已派裝甲車及脚踏車隊、不時前往巡邏、各馬路出入口、亦加派探捕守望、以備萬一、</p>
<p>日方不斷修築工事</p>
<p>極司非爾路十一號、自被日僞佔據以來、迄今已有一週、日來對防禦工程、尙在不斷修築中、昨日復在大門兩旁圍牆上、沿地各鑿一圓洞、通達外面所築之沙堡、而沙堡之側、並加裝鉛絲網、以增加防禦力量、門首仍由僞警六名擔任警衛、日偽出入者絕少、駐守內部之人數、昨日似已减少、</p>
<p>探捕搜查往來行人</p>
<p>極司非爾路十五號之秋圃及康家橋·金家巷一帶、仍有僞警佈崗駐守、情形與往日相同、馬路橋日憲兵西區司令部及僞警分署門首之堡壘、正由日憲兵搬運磚石、積極建築中、至曹家渡方面、因前日崗捕所佩之手槍被暴徒刧去後、昨日捕房方面、派有裝甲車一輛在該區巡邏、勞勃生路一帶、探捕亦見增加、對往來行人、施行搜查、形勢又見緊張、</p>

<h3>日海軍揚言　封鎖溫州灣　定今日下午七時起　已通和右第三國方面</h3>
<p>上海與溫州之交通、近來常因日方海軍之行動、以致時有不便、昨悉日方頃又以駐華艦隊司令之決定、由日本駐滬總領事通吿第三國外交官員及海關方面、謂定今（十七）日下午七時起、將實行封鎖溫州灣、塡置障碍物、其封鎖地帶、則為（一）尾岙山之西側水道、（二）霓礁基點二百七十度綫附近、（三）小五星島及虎頭島東北端毗連綫附近等處、</p>
<h3>貢米繼續平糶　竭力維持秩序　昨開糶平民爭先恐後　一糴米老嫗不幸踏斃</h3>
<p>昨為貢米平糶第一日、平糶時問雖規定為上午八時開始、但昨晨五時、購米平民即紛至沓來、携筐担囊、鵠候於各平糶處鬥首、待八時後、各區人數平均在二三千人以上、計（第一區）米一百包、於下午二時、即吿售罄、（第二區）首批一百包、於中午售罄、午後續發一百包、亦經於二時許售完、旋復續發一百包、至四時止、尙未售罄、平民不允散去、直至七時、始吿畢事、（第二區）一百包於中午售罄、因該處秩序欠佳、下午宣吿停售、（第四區）因人數擁擠、發生慘劇、下午亦停售、（第五區）一百包、於中午售罄、該處秩序最好、</p>
<p>四區糶米發生慘劇</p>
<p>法租界西門路二四九號山東會館、於昨晨八時、由上海市米號業同業公會經辦各團體第四平糶處、舉辦平糶、乃値此米貴嚴重時期、未屆時間、已麕集五六千人、惟老幼不一、知識參差、爭先恐後、不守决序、不幸慘劇遂因之發生</p>
<p>人數過多一擁而入</p>
<p>緣該處平糶、雖規定上午八時開始、而天未破曉、即有前往守候者、未及八時、人數愈聚愈衆、斯時祇有三道頭越捕、兩華捕頭、及兩値崗華捕、早已無法維持、故在最前者已擁至門口、同、時山東會館內附設齊魯學校學生、正値上學之際、大衆即乘機一擁而入、約有三百餘人、巡捕趕將鐵門緊閉、不料門外人數衆多、山東會館正面大鐵門、忽然擁開、致站在最前者被擠倒地、繁呼救命、秩序大亂、</p>
<p>前仆後擁愈壓高</p>
<p>且人數衆多、前仆後擁、愈壓愈高哭喊震天、當時雖經在塲少數巡捕及平糶人員竭力施救、毫無效用、迫捕房得訊、派到大批探捕、始解重圍、惟壓在底層年的六十餘歲之老嫗、脅骨踏斷、氣息僅存、送醫未幾、即傷重斃命、尙有杭州籍弟兄二人重傷胸部、一名童金生、二十八歲、一名童阿三、二十六歲、同住康悌路馬浪路七七八號、叉本地婦人陸唐氏三十六歲、住蒲石路楊家弄昌元里六十七號、傷胸腰、</p>
<p>未及三時即吿罄</p>
<p>此外輕傷頭破血流失鈔毀衣者、不知凡幾、虞洽卿先生得訊、驅車蒞塲查詢慰問、深致慨嘆、而平糶米未及三小時、即吿售罄、幷在大門口貼示平價米業已售完了、明天上午八時再糶、惟未購得老麕集大門外、迄晚不散、少數已購得米票未曾取米者、經平糶處職員簽字證明、准於今日續取米糧、</p>
<p>其他各區亦有受傷昨日各平糶處雖有探捕協助、維持秩序、但因人數過擠、相互爭攘、致除山東會館內第四區釀成慘劇外、北河南路靶子路之第一區、昨晨人數衆多、所搭蘆蓆棚、竟被擠倒、門前之木柵、亦被踏斷、卡德路雖亦屬蘆蓆棚、惟地位較寬、僅木栅斷裂、第三區玉佛寺、昨晨亦有平民一人被擠、受傷頗重、第二區卡德路口、下午二時許、亦有人受傷、</p>
<p>虞洽卿氏極為關懷</p>
<p>虞洽卿氏談「此次平糶、因米糧質地頗佳、而每石售價二十元、故一般平民、爭相競購、原定兩租界平糶處五處、每處每日規定以一百包為限、然現在情形、顯已絕對不敷、故已决定不加限制、以所有八千包平糶米糧售完為止、關於昨日平糶經過情形、購者過於擁擠、以後爲避免此類情事發生、各平糶處將攔進出口、使購者得依决進出、俾免搶軋、至於玉佛寺等平糶處、昨日發現有難民多人、前往購米、彼輩難民、在收容所中、旣有口糧供給、米價高漲、絕未受及影響、購米目的、似在圖利、苟允彼輩得購平米、則將失辦理平糶之目的故已加以制止、此後是吾繼續訂購貢米、辦理平糶、現各方尙在進行中、</p>
<p>昨日米價下跌一元</p>
<p>昨日貨主至米市塲管委會登記承銷之米、總數為六千四百二十九包、市塲交易仍屬淸淡、又因昨日為開始貢米平糶之日、市塲受其影響、米價乃下跌一元、最高秈米價格每石為二十八元、粳米因無貨成交、價格並無變化、據該管理委員談、明日為「九一八」紀念、市塲循例本應休假、但鑒於滬上米市情形、未能安定、故明日亦並不休假、在廢曆中秋節後、市塲在星期日、亦已决定照常開市、</p>

<h3>白報紙　來源無慮　挪輪裝大批來滬</h3>
<p>德波戰事發生後、洋貨價格飛漲、允以白報紙一項、飛漲更速、平時每令僅售六七元、現則已達每令售價三十餘元、致各報館書局及舉凡印刷事業、均大受影響、茲悉滬商前向歐州定購之大批白報紙、現已絡續來滬、價格或將抑低、茲悉挪威商輪Talleyrand脫雷郞突號、裝有大批白報紙、定於今日抵滬、尙有Helmspey黑侖司斐號、亦滿裝白報紙、現正在途中、大約於二十左右抵滬、且聞某德輪於德波開戰時、本亦裝運載多量報紙來滬、但旋在新嘉坡附近被扣、</p>
<h3>被扣之兩外籍記者　自甬返滬　因兩人未備護照　於吉安途决被扣</h3>

<h3>德商對華方定單　仍允依約解貨　盲目漲價恐貽後悔　投機囤積應有覺悟</h3>
<p>戰後之、海、因內地資金流入甚巨、以致資金漸感充裕、但因缺乏正當運用之途徑、造成投機事業之勃興、如外匯套利、外幣黃金證券之買賣、以至各種商品之囤積、使租界內物價高翔、與工業之畸形發展、此種發展、非但不利上海金融市塲之安定、且與政府戰時金融政策背道而馳、迨自歐戰發生之後、凡來自英德法各貨、皆逐步飛漲、甚有漲至十倍以上者、允以顏料洋針洋絨五金西藥煤等為最甚、顏料中之黑電粉、每担自九十元漲至一千餘元、洋針禮和針每萬六十元、漲至一百六十元、報紙每令七元漲至二十六元、其主要原因為在此混亂情形之下、買者恐來源愈少、而賣者則期待厚利</p>
<p>一般無知識者、鑒於上次之歐戰發財情形、竟不管上海之存底如何、及此後之實銷如何、拼命從事囤積、各洋行工廠商號則乘機抬價、遂造成此種畸形之怪現象、但一般人民之生計則大受其影響、但要知現在之中國適在抗戰時期、與上决歐戰時之中國不同、况上决歐戰因戰事延長數年、確因存底吿罄所致、此次歐戰爆發三五日內即造成上述現象、况目前英德法在華存貨尙稱充足、來源並不完全吿絕、如由德運華之德貨輪兩艘、滿裝顏料洋針等貨、雖被阻於日本、但現已卸下、改裝日輪行將抵滬、同時德國貨物已裝中立國之船隻駛華、聞有丹麥船King號、已裝洋紙五金等貨、將於本月二十六日抵滬、故此後歐貨仍得來華至德商在滬各洋行對中國商人之定單、仍允依的解貨、並不因歐戰而取消定單、故望投機囤積洋貨圖利者、應有相當之覺悟、以免將來後悔、同時使上海之物價、不致再行畸形飛漲、而人民生計、稍可安定云、</p>
<h3>德輸擬　試航浙東　哈納安全返滬　滬溫貨運漸暢</h3>
<p>行駛滬甬綫各德商輪隻、自歐戰發生後、能吾繼續航行、各方頗為關切、即各公司本身亦遲遲未能決定、旋經禮和洋行船務部老慮結果、認為在中立國領海三海里之內航行、並不蒙受影響、故謀福輪遂決定於十四晚由鎭駛滬、十五日午即安全抵埠、</p>
<p>哈納返滬沿途安全</p>
<p>茲悉德商遠東公司哈納輸亦於前晚返滬、業於昨晨抵達金利源碼頭、據該輸船員稱、沿途情形極為安全、以上兩輸、現仍擬照常航行、但何日啟椗、尙未確定、聞海福輸俟裝貨完竣、亦將定期駛滬、</p>
<p>滬溫貨運漸貨暢通</p>
<p>滬溫航綫封鎖已久、所有貨運均吿停滯、日前經英商新安利輪試航順利返滬後、泰昌祥代理之英輪新祥泰、及怡隆洋行之神愛神福等輪、均先後續行駛溫、業已抵達溫州靠埠卸裝貨物、又怡隆洋行之神佑輪、亦定今日開赴溫州、英商遠東航務公司之永泰馬勒輪、定九月十九日由滬直放溫州、英商怡隆公司之神佑輪、於前日由烟台抵滬、亦準今晨由滬駛溫、惟各輸現暫時袛裝貨不搭客、故滬溫貨運、已漸貨暢通、</p>
<p>高登駛海門金淸港</p>
<p>又據大光社記者向航業界探悉、浙東海門、自經華軍當局實施封鎖後航運斷絕、為時將近半載、茲悉德商魯麟洋行之高登輪、現擬試航附近海門之金淸港、亦以裝貨為限、惟何日啟椗現尙未定、</p>

<p>滬西防範更為嚴密</p>
<p>滬西區五角塲前日曾發生暴徒搶劫公共租界巡捕手槍三枝事件、故當局對於此事、異常注意、咋日起由靜安寺·戈登路·普渡路·三捕房加派探捕、在滬西區加緊防範、除加設雙崗外、並由車巡隊巡邏隊加緊巡行、允注意靜安寺路·極司非而路·愚園路·白利南路·康腦脫路·安和寺路·星嘉坡路·等馬路、法租界方面、亦在徐家匯一帶加意防範、</p>

<h3>八月份　日貨進出口額　均較七月份為减少　主要出口物係古瓶</h3>
<p>上海一埠、邇來對日貿易進出口、雖因種種關係、未能有精詳之統計、然進出口品類、則較戰前亦頗有變遷、據海關方面消息、八月份上海日貨進出口額、均絞七月份减少、計進口、五三·三九五噸、其中以化學工業藥品輸入激减、其大宗進口貨品、為木材·水泥·洋紙、而汽水與啤酒、竟亦達三千噸之多、紡織機及機件的六百噸、其中尙有鮮魚與鹹菜的七百噸、野茶一千四百餘噸、至於八月份對日出口、則僅一萬餘噸、其中主要出口物、則為古瓶、計五千餘噸、可謂創中日貿易之新格、絲繭則僅一百餘噸、麻類十噸、小麥豆餅居對日輸出第一位、為四千噸餘、觀此上海中日貿易之近狀、亦可略見梗概矣、</p>
<h3>歐洲難民來滬　不全禁止　各方意見相同　批准後生效力</h3>

<p>黃浦江潮水因氣候關係、自十一日起連續發生高潮、平均均在十英尺以上、昨日因東南風較疾、故下午二時許、潮水自陰溝倒灌、致菜市街。英華街。浙江路·廣西路·南京路·辣斐德路·等低窪馬路、均吿積水、自三五寸至尺許不等、直至五時始行退去、惟曹家渡一帶、則仍水沒及跺、據濬浦總局報吿、此次高潮、須至二十日方止、除今明二日（十七十八）與昨日相仿外、其餘各日、僅在十尺左右、馬路當不致積水、</p>

<h3>品行</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>在上課的時候，老師有時對同學們這樣說：「近來有許多同學的品行太不好了……』各位同學聽了，會立刻挺起背脊，堅閉着嘴，眼睛看準鼻子，必恭必敬，雅雀無聲地坐着。</p>
<p>大多數的小朋友，都以為要品行好，只要不開口，不活動，愈像老年人愈合格，這種觀念全是錯誤的，必須糾正。</p>
<p>各位小朋友，我們應該知道品行的好壊，不在這種枝節上面，而且活潑，好發表，根本上是好的行為。</p>
<p>我以為品行的好壊，要看我們對於別人的態度怎樣，如果那個小朋友做事肯努力，很負責，和耐勞吃苦並且又能愛護公物，幫助別人，這樣，就是品行好的小朋友，如果妬忌人家，專做利己的事，這種小朋友即許它整天規規矩矩的坐着，品行也算不得好，如果做了壊事，而裝做規規矩矩的樣子，那品行的惡劣，更不消說了。</p>
<p>有許多小朋友，很歡喜或是希望得到別人的獎勵和恭維，這在品行方面說也是有虧損的，為什麽呢？因為我們求品行好，是應該的，但並不是求人獎勵或恭維的因為　成了這種心理，做事很容易作假，而且很會驕傲自大的。</p>
<p>或許有些小朋友要問我。「怎樣便可做一個品行優良的學生呢？」要回答這個問題，不是幾句話所能詳盡，扼要地說：第一要多做利人利大衆的事；第二能時時反省自己；第三多讀有益身心的書籍，第四要多方面參加社會活動。</p>
<h3>血肉塡成的惠通橋</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>九百七十二公里的汽車路，三百七十座的公路橋，一百四十萬立方尺的石砌工程，差不多近千萬立方尺的土方，但是不曾用一架機器，不曾動用巨額的國庫，只憑着二千五百萬民工的搶築，這條滇緬公路，只有五個月的短時間，已吿全段通車。當你讀到史地雲南這一課的時候，你可曾想起這條血肉所塡成的公路嗎</p>
<p>當這條公路建築的過程中，有許多可歌可泣的驚人史料，値得我們的記憶的。現在我只把三百七十座中的一座惠通橋，給小朋友們介紹一下。惠通橋是怒江上的一頂大橋。關於怒江，小朋友們在敎科書早已讀過，它的水勢湍急，它的脾氣在暴，用不着我多來記述，一句話可以包括它的性質的，就是說，它和一條巨蟒一樣。</p>
<p>建築這橋的時節，徵用了三種工人，印度民族的鐵工，革命策源地的廣東木匠，和有建築滇越路經騐的雲南石工。為了要使橋身鞏固，能够使千寓噸的鋼鐵馱過這橋，因此，必須用栗木做材料，偏是這栗木，不是到處都有的木材。它們都深藏在原始的深山林中。耍化費七八天路程，摸着懸崖絕壁，在荊棘的林叢中鑽出鑽進，才能把這木材從那裏砍伐下來，供給這現代化的建築工程，還得有好幾百倘工人，常川在不見天日的古森林中，四處尋覓，手不停揮的砍伐着。</p>
<p>還算是造化的，這惠通橋的建築，僅僅是利用舊有的橋墩，加强些原來的載重力。如果要像那共他的橋先動手下橋基的工程，正不知還有多少人的血肉，塡在這橋樑的下面。說到這裹，我們不能不感謝那位緬甸的僑胞梁金山先生，他在民國二十年時，因為見着每年不知有多少死在渡江竹排上的同胞，因此便捐了巨款，造了一座鐵索橋，以便利旅客，現在却同樣的使這一件工程，省去了不少的汗血、</p>
<p>在這一件工程中，爲了視國的前途而犧牲的，至少總有八分之一的數目，其中大部份是由於一種瘴毒，和其他工程上的危險。但是我們難道就讓這班無名英雄無聲無息地長眠在地下嗎？</p>
<h3>兒童自由畫　西成小學</h3>
<h3>第三個家</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒避難記之三十四—</p>
<p>明兒一家東飄西蕩的歷遍了千山萬水，眞是意想不到的，竟在遠隔了家鄕千餘里外的異鄕，建設了第三個家，可是這筆建設費—不少的金錢，長途的跋涉，無窮的精力，也着實可觀了。</p>
<p>在到達他們的目的地之後幸虧有張先生照料，一切都辦妥了，不然不知要混亂得怎樣？而在當地的居民抱着憐惜的態度和他們表同情，似乎現出很願意帮助的樣子。在那村的一角，張先生更找到了一橡平屋，作為明兒的第三個家，明兒父親當然很感激他的熱心而租金的便宜，也出人的意外：原來這屋子是張先生的親戚的，本是說不要租金，可是明兒父親總覺不妥，結果每月出一元算為租金明兒父親便謝了又謝。那村中人眞是優待他們到頂點了。</p>
<p>明兒的第三個家的環境是挺優秀的—遠山團團圍住着四周，是他們的障壁，西邊有一條山溪，終日汨汨的流着，南首是縱橫的阡陌，東北面是鄰舍，屋後一片野草地，是猪牛羊的樂園。這屋子的構造，是和明兒的家鄕大大的不同：屋的中央，一間沒有鬥窗的客堂，到了冬天一些也不能遮蔽寒風。堂前是一條狹長的天井，正中一隻缸貼對客堂，（那村中的人家都是千篇一律據說是風水的關係）因此大門都是開在側面。在客堂的兩側是兩間狹小的臥室，只有一個小窗洞，裏面便黑暗得可怕，空氣帶着混濁的氣味，連明兒的小弟妹在白日裏也不敢踏進去。</p>
<p>這完全不像故鄕房屋的明朗了。在那村子裏簡直找不到一間寬大而光亮的臥室，這是給與明兒一個很深刻的印象。</p>
<p>屋子是有了，屋子裹的器具怎麼辦？明兒家連一條長櫈也沒有，而一家必需品·牀·桌·椅·灶·柴…繁雜異常，一件件買起來麽？太費錢了，而且這個家又是臨時的，幸虧那房東太太很客氣，但是雙方言語不通，由張先生關照明兒母親：需要什麽東西，房東太太家裹一切都有，不用買了，寫一張條子，便可呌他們搬來。那使明兒的一家大小都是十二萬分的感激。那房東太太還親自的從弄口外伊的家裏拿了兒明家所需要的東西來，伊的脚又是小而不伶俐的，年紀也有五十出外，這使明兒母親十分的不安，便呌明兒等去帮忙了。這樣的房東太太是少有的了。忙了二天左右，才整理好，而這第三個家也有些象樣了。在這繁忙的兩天中明兒家暫時不開伙食，因爲什麼鍋子哪木柴哪…這些要自備了，一時還沒有買到，只好在張先生家吃飯了。過了兩天，一切總算齊備，但是菜蔬到那裏去買呢？那村子裹除了肉和油鹽醬醋外，其他一切的菜蔬都沒有出賣的，因為在這村子中的人家總有一些空地種些菜蔬，已足供一家的需要，但是明兒家怎樣辦呢？那房東太太眞好，把伊自已田裏種的菜，採些菜皮（那村子裏都吃菜皮而讓菜心長大）送給他們明兒母親感激不盡。假使弄口有小販挑來了什麽菜蔬之類，伊總替他還好了饅便宜的價錢親自拿了秤到明兒家來，做着手勢（因為言語不通的關係）來通知，明兒母親見了伊的秤便明瞭伊的意思了。</p>
<p>「第三個家能建設起來，全靠那房東太太的帮助，我們的運氣眞不錯到處有人照應。」在一各晚上，明兒母親喃喃的唸着。</p>
<h3>科學常識</h3>
<p>— 默言</p>
<p>水為什麽能滅火</p>
<p>小朋友！假使你把一枝點着火的蠟燭，浸到水裏去的時候，那蠟燭便會很快的熄滅。這是什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>原來蠟燭的燃燒，只需要空氣，（允其是空氣中的養氣），不需要水。現在把蠟燭浸在水裹，水便不讓空氣與火接觸，缺了空氣，火就自然熄減了。</p>
<p>我們也可以用其他方法來把火撲滅，或者甩被頭，毯子蓋上去，或者把黃沙撒在火上。因為被頭，毯子，黃沙都能阻止空氣與火接觸，而火便因此熄滅了。</p>
<p>吹燭為什麼能使它熄滅？</p>
<p>我們要熄滅一根着火的火柴或一枝蠟燭的時候，從沒有把水撥在它們上面，只須對準它們吹了一口氣，便可恨快地把火吹熄。這是什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>假使要擦着一根火柴，我們必須先使它發熱，把它放在火柴盒旁磨擦，或觸在一件熱的東西上，然後才會生出火來。　那麼，我們怎樣來使它熄滅呢？只要使它重新冷下去好了，怎樣使它再冷下尖呢？只耍把它吹一下就是了。所以我們吹火柴使它冷，便把它熄滅了</p>
<h3>毛巾漲價原因</h3>
<p>— （墨瀋）</p>
<p>毛巾已有完全國貨，跟外匯似乎沒有多大關係，而近來也價格飛漲。據業中人說，印花的顏料，必須舶來品，現在顏料漲價，故印花巾比全白毛巾，每打要多費印工料六七角，倘然顏料再漲的話，毛巾當然不免隨之而漲到驚人</p>
<p>我想，揩面要取淸凈，儘可用全白毛巾來應用，何必定須花色呢，我們現正力行節約，對於家常日用品，自應格外注意到、全白毛巾，淸净而無疑衛生，雅觀而又可省費，很容易實行轉變的一件事，比較不吸紙烟而改旱烟，更來得便當。願有志節的運動的朋友，大家來提倡實行。</p>
<p>綿織廠停造花色毛，本非難事，可是一般愛好花色的用戶，不變更心理，那末，反而替舶來品推廣生意了，所以，這件小運動，倒應該向大衆宣傳的。（不受酬）</p>

<h3>畜生道中（十八）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>彭其病愈之後，第一决下樓去時，他就要求見一見勒夫，把它帶到客窒中來，原來它對於這一頭鬈毛狗，同過了患難，感情上是特別的好了。當時下人就去開了狗舍，放出勒夫來，勒夫本來惦記得彭其甚麽似的，立刻衝到屋子裹來。它剛到前廳，就聞着了彭其的氣味，不待下人指引，早就趕到了客室裏；彭其聽得了鈴聲琅琅，知道勒夫來了，即忙站起身來，張開了兩隻臂接待它。勒夫似吠非吠的在呌了一聲，直撲到彭其的臂間，接着就瀉落下來，跌倒在地。死了麽？是的，勒夫已死了，那一聲在呌，就是一種說不出的快樂的表示。它的身體本已衰弱到了極點，一見到小主人，受到了意外的刺激，可憐它竟因刺激過度而快樂死了。</p>
<p>彭其失去了道一個忠心的朋友，非常的悲哀，那傷心的眼淚，一滴一滴地掉在那疤痕斑斑的小臉龐上，把他殘酷的本性，完全打消了。他先前雖雖了許多罪惡，一心只想懺悔，從此對於畜類，便特別的仁愛起來，竟做了畜類的好朋友，末了還成了一個第一流的傳物學家，原來從古到今，往往有許多頑劣不堪的小孩子，只要改過向上，後來就會變做一個非常人物，彭其不過是一個例子罷了。</p>
<p>到得彭其完全恢復了健康以後，和他的兩位小妹妹共同地愛護畜類，在家開樂一個小小的動物院，作為他們的畜生道。彭其很想再找一頭像勒夫那麼的鬆毛狗，可是竟沒有找到，於是就把諾克斯作為他的唯一的好友；他說：「我要把認識勒夫的狗來做我的好友，留一個永久的紀念；要是諾克斯不念我的舊惡，我自問現在是够得上做它的好友了。」諾克斯那裏會念他的舊惡呢，他們原已救了它的性命，如今見他優待自己，當然也盡忠於他，正像勒夫生前一樣。</p>
<p>彭其把他的零用錢慢慢地儲蓄起來，到得積成了一筆整數，他就在勒夫的墳土上立了一塊碑的，碑上刻着幾行字道；「紀念一位忠誠的朋友，它外表很粗魯內心却是很溫柔的。某年月因見主人病體復元，快樂而死。」（完）</p>

<h3>菊事偶憶（上）</h3>
<p>— 肖傖</p>

<h3>任光和安娥</h3>
<p>— 安瀾</p>
<p>膾炙人口的「漁光曲」「打狼歌」等電影歌曲的作者，任光與安娥，他倆原是一對熱情的戀人，同居了好久，但是始終還沒有舉行過一次結婚的儀式。</p>
<p>任光在八一三戰事發生之前，即去巴黎考察音樂，現在他已經回國，轉程到了新都的重慶，在陶行知先生所創辦的藝術學院擔任敎職；同時他並領導着重慶的著名歌詠團體。聽說，在不久之後，他還預備出國去。</p>
<p>安娥，她不但在重慶的音樂團體中活躍，她還加入了蔣夫人領導下的新生活婦女工作團服務。此外，要是她一有空閒時間，那就拼命的作着救亡歌詞，以供各音樂團體及歌詠團體合奏的需要。</p>
<p>現在，這一對中國著名的歌曲作家，一雙曾經過息難的戀人，他倆在重慶碰了面，舊情復熾，那是必然的事。不過，在據接近他們的友人們看來，他倆對神聖的工作，是比一己的私情，更要來得重視，這點，又是値得給一般專談「戀愛救國」的人，作為楷範的。</p>

<h3>咖啡西施</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Good　Girls　Go　To　Paris”</p>
<p>喜劇，喜劇，又是一支詼諧風趣的喜劇。</p>
<p>「咖啡西施」的故事，是自始至終以「巧合」來堆砌起來的。從一個在大學茶室內充女侍的女郎珍妮，到紐的之後，展開了錯綜複雜的色情糾紛，而她終於和大學敎授羅尼結婚。劇作者所刻意描寫的奧拉夫家庭，也正是我們在大都市中所習見的。每一個人物都是任性妄作，而且互相欺騙，以遂一己之私慾，也同時浪費他們的生命。我們且看一看奧拉夫的家庭：</p>
<p>祖父奧拉夫是頑固糊塗，近於神經病似的；母親卡珞琳有一個年輕的男友：兒子湯姆遊蕩成性；女兒薛薇爾戀着老僕之子丹尼士。</p>
<p>亞力山大霍爾的導演手腕是非常富强的。他把這家庭中的每一個人物都解剖得淸淸楚楚，而他的細膩精緻的彫琢，是在以下兩個例子中看出來。</p>
<p>（一）珍妮到了奧拉夫家中，母親卡洛琳僞稱她是女兒薛薇爾的同學，特來參加婚禮，而博得祖父奧拉夫的歡心。第二天早餐時，兒子湯姆的驚異，女兒和珍妮的假意親善，都處理得生動之至。而大學敎授羅尼（薛薇爾的未婚夫）到來之後，更展開了生動的塲面。</p>
<p>（二）薛薇爾和羅尼結婚之夕，導演者在同一時間內要解開如此複雜的戀愛糾紛，從容不迫的手法是罕見的。如卡洛琳受男友保羅的誘惑，將相偕情奔。珍妮故意誘惑保羅，以絕卡洛琳之念。但是祖父奧拉夫宣佈孫兒湯姆和珍妮訂婚的消息了，這使保羅及羅尼驚駭不已。忽然律師來見奧拉夫，說是珍妮和丹尼士宵遊時，車撞路人，已成殘廢，要求撫卹。其實和丹尼士宵遊的是薛薇爾，她謊稱珍妮的。而珍妮呢，因為湯姆欠着一個賭棍五千塊錢，無力償還，所以珍妮承認薛薇爾的冒名，以五千元為交換條件，去償還了湯姆的賭債。但是羅尼知道珍妮宵來沒有出遊，逼着追問，才千頭萬緒的把各人的私隱揭露。</p>
<p>茂文陶格拉斯的大學敎授羅尼很穩重。瓊白朗黛兒的珍妮，前半部中的輕佻放蕩是演得很好的，後面的自我犧牲，心理衝突不够顯著。華德康諾萊是本片中最成功的一個演員，因為他的動作，言語都能把握奧拉夫這一人物的性格。</p>
<p>南風劇社定於十七日（星期日）上午九時半假斜橋衖仙樂大戲院作首决實騐公演，劇目有「蠢貨」，「兩僩患難朋友」及「放生」三獨幕劇。票價一元，六角，四角三種。</p>
<p>上海劇藝社因十七，十八日戒嚴，停演兩天，十九日起上演（人之初），値得一看。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>王克琴與張勳離合之經過</p>
<p>克琴也是個不饒人的悍婦，凡看過她的「殺子報」的，都要望之吐舌，吵時她口口聲聲嚷着「我是你們漢子把我强佔了的，誰稀罕要作辮子大帥的太太」！她本來理直氣壯，就是有時初老張聽見，也是自覺理短，奈何人家不得，可巧不久克琴又養了一個兒子，取名夢范，因此格外驕縱起來。說起道個兒子，也還有段奇事，原來徐城南門外有一個范增墓，徐人皆稱曰土山，相傳覇王中漢反間之計，因而疑增，增乃棄羽而去，後疽發背死，羽兵掘土埋之，高的十餘丈，旁有河曰沙家汪，據云即係當年掘土處也。王生子之日，忽夢范增入懐，因遂取名夢范，究吾實有其事，或係藉此邀寵，故意欺蒙老張，那就非局外人所得而知了。不過克琴自從生子後，更是深得老張歡心，小髦子也就漸漸失寵，卒因氣妒抑鬱，性情暴躁，遂致二目失明。未幾張又納一妾名小翠，小髦子為欲報復克琴計，乃與小翠極力拉攏，時在張前進讒，中傷克琴。迨後張氏避入荷蘭使館，時命各妾輪宿，克琴恥不願往，遂為老張所恨。翠等知張深惡雅片，復誘克琴吸之，及張出，二怒歸一，揚言欲殺克琴，其實乃恫嚇之言耳。克琴大懼，遂背張出走，在上海老共舞台又復懸牌出演，然而彼時已色衰嗜深，號召力自然差得多了。（一〇三）</p>

<p>國際動態</p>
<h3>德國的政策與戰略</h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>對蘇是收貨　對英是失策</p>
<p>不願戰事擴大</p>
<p>我們如果不曉得實際眞相，而僅看表面文章，往往會得如墮入五里霧中，不能得到一個正確的判斷。比如德國進攻波蘭後，英法已經動員，向德國西境進攻，而德國也厲兵秣馬，整備決一雌雄，可是德國官方仍舊宣傳，說德國願與法國消除百年世仇，釋嫌修好，德國對於法國已無領土的需索，即使法國對德進攻，德國也不過以還擊為限。又說法國的捲入戰爭，完全受英國的指使，德外長里賓特洛甫發表關於英德交涉但澤談話，也痛斥英國，說任何引起戰爭的責任，應該由英國負担。</p>
<p>所怕的是英國</p>
<p>我們從上面的談話，可以看到德方的兩個意向，第一是德國不願戰爭擴大，第二是德國沒有料到英國的態度會這樣的堅決，所以對於英國的站在法國方面，援助波蘭，對德作戰，非常恐懼，也非常痛恨。德國的對波作戰，我們知道，最初仍行法西的故智，想利用但澤的國社黨，如福斯脫等人，組織秘密軍隊，實行所謂潛在戰爭（Crytical　war），一舉而推鄱但澤的原來政府，而遂行德國佔領但澤的陰謀。可是今年的波蘭政府，並不如去年捷克政府那樣容易就範，而英法幾個國家，也怵於今年三月，德國滅亡捷克手段的毒辣，不讓德國像去年那樣經過意首相墨索里尼的調停，開一價四强會議，遂把捷克放在納粹的掌握。德國在這樣情形之下，就鋌而走險，實行以兵戎與波蘭相見。德國的侵略波蘭，說沒有把法國的援助估計在內，那是不會的。只是僅一法國，德國還可以應付裕如，若於法國之外，加入英國，那是德國最所畏懼的事。</p>
<p>解除東顧之憂</p>
<p>被納粹黨人所視為聖經的希特勒著「我的奮鬥」一書中，希特勒對於上决大戰中威廉二世的外交政策，交惡英俄兩國因而後來使德國在軍事上不得不在東西兩戰塲作戰，大加攻擊。他因此極端反對與英國作海軍競賽，引起英國的反感，同時又主張避免與英國競爭殖民地與海外貿易，道樣可以使英國不致干涉德國在歐洲大陸的行動，而使德國得有餘裕實行其領土政策（BodenPolitik），那就是向東歐發展的政策。蘇德不侵犯條的的締結，使希特勒解除了東顧之憂，道可說是他外交政策的一部分成功。他又知道，英法對於波蘭，沒有地理上的銜接，波蘭對德國作戰，英法是無法把軍隊開往波蘭境內，共同作戰，抵抗德國的。所以蘇德不侵犯條的一成立，希特勒就用迅雷不及掩耳的手段，向波蘭開戰，其原因就在於此。</p>
<p>西方暫取守勢</p>
<p>希特勒目前所採取的戰略，當然是西方取守勢，而以全力進攻波蘭，擊潰了波蘭，然後回師西向，與英法周旋。問題是原料缺乏的德國，是吾能在英法海軍封鎖下，作持久戰？英法海軍對德封鎖後，德國一切航運，都已斷絕，一切接濟，雖可仰賴毘連的中立國，可是英法今後必對各中立國，積極行使外交手腕，使其不協助交戰國，自無疑問。這是德國對優越海軍勢力的英國，最所畏懼痛恨的點。</p>
<p>希望意國轉園</p>
<p>此外，德國現在陷於孤立無助，也是牠所焦慮的另一原因。在但澤問題最緊張的時候，軸心國的另一巨頭墨索里尼，曾勸吿希特勒，令其慎重，等到戰事爆發後，墨索里尼藉口德國以武力解決但澤問題，正在他努力和平解決之時，認德國此種行動，破壊意國的担保。因此決定暫時維持中立。德國方面對意大利表示中立，雖片面加以解釋，說意國這樣行動，使英法對意態度捉摸不定，對德更為有利，然實際不過是一種飾辭。其實，誰担保意大利不重演上次大戰中臨時拆台的老把戲呢？所以德國在國際政治舞台上，已差不多成了光桿，苦悶可知。現在德國放出不願把戰爭擴大，不願進攻法國的論調，以及最近表示德意兩國間仍維持軸心政策，他的意思當然仍想意國出而轉園，在進攻波蘭勝利後，仍能獲得相當的報酬而止，免蹈上决大戰的覆轍，但不曉得欲「撲滅國社主義而才罷休」的英國，他標榜了這樣的主張，僅是對德國虛聲恫嚇呢，抑必貫澈而後已呀！</p>
<h3>北戰塲的國防新軍　十軍團</h3>
<p>由石友三將軍指揮　轉戰冀魯晋各省區</p>
<p>十軍團的名字或許對後方民衆有一點生疏的感覺吧？但在北戰塲上，一提起十軍團來，那是無人不知，無人不曉的。它是一支强有力的勁旅，一個堅强龐大的力量。它是在民族革命的旗幟下，在英勇的石友三將軍領導下，而緊密團結起來的一羣華北兒女。</p>
<p>兩年來，追奔逐北，馬不停蹄，十軍團的弟兄辛苦了，的確辛苦了。他們曾馳騁於河北的遼闊大平原，曾爬過崇巍的王屋山，中條山，以及錯綜複雜的魯南山地。他們這樣珍愛他們故鄉，二年來從未離開華北一步。華北是他們生長的故鄉，至死他們也不願離開那裏的。</p>
<p>石友三將軍是十軍團唯一的領導者。數萬華北的健兒能擁有這樣一個賢明果敢的領袖，的確是一件幸運的事。石先生的治軍是很嚴的，在西北軍中，一提起石閻王，大家都有點毛骨悚然，所以在每一决作戰，如沒有相機撤退的命令，兵士們至死也不敢離開火綫的。</p>
<p>十軍團的成長</p>
<p>十軍團像其他隊伍一樣，一天一天地生長起來，壯大起來。它的母胎就是七七以前的冀北保安司令。隊伍一共有八千多人。</p>
<p>蘆溝橋的烽火燃燒了，中華民族解放的巨浪掀起來了。一部份保安隊曾扼守蘆溝橋畔，作了極光榮的犧牲。接着保安隊轉戰馬廠，滄州，始正式改編為一八一師，從此冀北保安隊便一變而為正式國軍了。</p>
<p>在滄州一八一師與劉多荃軍換防下來，便與日人轉戰於淸風大名一帶。去年一月下旬又與三十二軍換防，扼守平漢前綫的湯陰，二月初旬，日人由安陽潮湧似地南下，華軍為避免重大犧牲，誘日深入，便順着道淸綫轉進於晋南山地，在那裏作了無數的血戰，得了大小無數决的光榮勝利。是在沁水中村，石師長始被中央明令升為六十九軍軍長，除原有一八一師外，並撥歸二十九軍新六師（師長為高樹勳）受六十九軍之指揮。石師長微笑了，一八一師的弟兄也微笑了。光榮的未來在佔滿每個人的心，那天大家整整歡樂了一晚，中條山谷裏佈滿了戰士們愉快的歌聲。</p>
<p>台兒莊戰事吃緊的時候。六十九軍的健兒眼紅了，熱血沸騰了。他們要衝向台兒莊去，恰巧這個時候，叉奉到中央向台兒莊增援的命令，戰士們的臉微笑着，因為報國的機會來臨了。</p>
<p>在戰鬭中長大</p>
<p>五月初到達台兒莊，被派到守衛台兒莊的右翼，旋又被命令向泰安轉進，但行至中途，徐州失守了，隊伍便在魯南停留下來。在魯南六十九軍一方面擾亂日人，一方面作建築堡壘的工作。經過三價月的努力工作結果，士兵的文化水準提高了，各團，營的缺額補充齊了，並還有一師多人的新兵，編為一個暫編師。同時，魯南各地的遊繫隊，都望風來歸。一時帶有六十九軍的番號的隊伍，幾至十萬人，六十九軍已壯大起來了。</p>
<p>八月中旬，石軍長升為第十軍團畏，不消說石軍團長的臉上又添滿了笑紋，六十九軍的弟兄叉在魯南山谷原野裏歡呼着。</p>
<p>二年來十軍團的發榮與滋長，實由於石軍團長的堅强領導與健兒們的英勇，所以能使十軍團脫初西北的舊殼，向國防新軍的路上走去。</p>
<h3>石友三將軍</h3>
<p>經濟常識</p>
<h3>標金</h3>
<p>— 王相秦</p>
<p>一、上海金市場之組織</p>
<p>上海之黃金買賣市塲，最初係以金業公會為塲所。及至民九以後，始有正式金業交易市塲之組織，其時先後成立者有二：一為上海證券物品交易所；一為上海金業交易所。嗣於民國二十六年，前者又奉令將金業部歸併於後者，於是上海金業交易所，遂成為上海唯一之金市塲矣。查該所買賣之金貨，雖號稱有國內金礦，各國金塊與金幣，赤金及標金等，惟平時買賣，則以標金為其大宗，餘則交易甚微，故上海金市塲實際上係一標金市塲也。</p>
<p>每日集中於上海金市塲實行交易之分子，有華商銀行，外商銀行，金業經紀人，銀樓業，錢莊，棉紗帮，證券帮，進出口商及本埠零星散戶，與各地客帮等。至言市塲中之交易方法，可分現期買賣與定期買賣二種：現期當天交割；定期交割則以二個月為限。曩者盛時，上海金業交易所中標金之交易，為數頗鉅，每月成交額恒在三四百萬條。自二十四年實行新貨幣政策後，滙市穩定，於是市塲標金投機之風大戢，交易銳减，每月成交數不過四五千條、滬戰發生后，營業即吿停頓；然自二十七年三月初，我國實行外滙統制後，一般投機者，又復利用上海外匯暗盤之上落，從中操縱，於是上海非法黑市之現金交易，頓時又形活躍。最近政府雖頒有集中收買黃金之法令，不許民間私行交易，但上海情形特殊，未能實行，標金之非法交易，仍繼續存在。</p>
<p>二、金價漲跌之原因</p>
<p>標金價格，與外滙及英美金價，息息相關。現美國雖非金本位國，但美金與黃金仍有相當固定之關係，故以美金計算之金價，極為穩定。英國在此决德波戰事未發生以前，以英鎊計算之黃金價格，亦極穩定。最近德波戰事爆發，英倫銀行放棄維持英鎊對外價値，倫敦金價，乃見上漲。在英美金價穩定之情况下，上海金價之漲跌，悉以上海外滙之鬆緊為轉移：外匯緊縮則金價漲，反之則金價跌。倘英美金價不穩定時，則上海金價之變動，緊跟英美金價及上海匯價之變動而比例上落。惟其漲跌程度，恒以就地供求關係，而與英美金價及上海匯價之變動稍有差異。再中國目前禁金出口，國內黃金，不能出口售得高價，故上海金價常低於倫敦金價。至上海標金與倫敦純金之平價，其計算方法如次：</p>
<p>例如九月六日英純金價八鎊八先令，即二〇一六辨士，而上海外匯暗市英滙為四辨士三一二五，折合上海金價之計算如下：</p>
<p>三、暗盤金價之動態</p>
<p>上海金業交易所自「八一三」停市後，不久即有暗盤市塲之出現；惟暗市中之金貨交易，祇限現貨買賣。自去年三月實行統制外滙後，以滙市暗槃伸縮無定及市上之供求關係，致金價之漲落日鉅。自「八一三」至去年三月十四日統制外匯前為止，上海金價極為穩定，每條（十兩）烚金價格最高不過一一四九元，較之戰前所漲甚微，趨勢尙覺緩和。迨去年三月十四日，政府實施外匯統制，外匯暗市日縮，暗盤金價遂日漸趨漲。及至去年八月份每條烚金最高價已漲至二〇四一元，較之上年同期之一一四五元，計漲八九六元。</p>
<p>自去年九月至今年三月金之先後頒布種種金貨管理條例關係，更促起金價一再高漲，最高漲至二一九〇元。及今年六月間中英外滙平準基金委員會停止供給上海暗市外滙，滙市暴縮，金價更一再狂漲，一度幾曾漲達五千元之紀錄。</p>
<p>近因德波戰事引起英法參戰，二决歐戰又在開展中，一般人因受上决歐戰銀貴金賤之敎訓，紛將存金拋售，致金價日趨在跌。至九月四日跌至三〇七〇，但最近外滙復縮，金價又趨漲勢。至將來趨勢，當視外滙及英美之金價為轉移也。</p>
<h3>帝王的薪金</h3>
<p>— 綱</p>
<p>在目前世界上，一個貴為帝王之尊的人，而他的薪金郤每不及一個企業家，銀行家，或甚至一個電影明星，請看下面一張關於世界各國帝王的薪金調查報吿：</p>
<p>英王喬治六世，年薪美金三百萬元，這筆錢全由國庫撥給。</p>
<p>日皇年薪一百三十萬元，另外他還有自己產業的盈餘的每年四百萬元。</p>
<p>荷蘭國的女王年俸七十萬元，她很節儉，日常生活費用和普通階級的女太太差不多。</p>
<p>瑞典國王年薪二十萬元，這數目恰巧是美國總統羅斯福的薪金一半。</p>
<p>保加利亞國王和希臘王的薪金最少，保加利亞王的年俸祗有四萬五千元，他的薪金雖如此的少，然而郤還有一個很大的國家博物院，和一個圖書館由他支款維持，希臘王的年俸是二萬五千元，他須每年將自己宮中所產的葡萄售去，以維日常開支！</p>
<h3>第一次世界大戰的一個統計</h3>
<p>— 葉紅</p>
<p>歐洲大戰已經爆發了。這會不會引起第二决的世界大戰，直到現在為止，還很難確說。但第二决世界大戰遲早總是免不了的。這裏且把第一决世界大戰的驚人統計，介紹一下</p>
<p>（一）在交戰國中，參戰兵士的達六千五百萬人；的合現今上海總人口的十三倍。</p>
<p>（二）因戰爭而死亡的人數，的在一千萬以上。終身成為殘廢的負傷者，則達二千四百萬人之多。</p>
<p>（三）大戰的費用，的為一萬二千萬萬馬克，佔歐洲全體人民許多世代艱苦强制勞動所積蓄的總財產的半數。如果按照本年九月二日匯豐掛牌的市價計算，那末這費用的合我國國幣七萬七千零九十六萬萬叉七千萬餘萬元：假定負担這戰費的人數，同中國人口一樣，那末每個人要出錢一萬六千四百元以上。</p>
<p>（四）從一九一四年八月三日法德宣戰，到一九一八年十一月十一日，德國和協的國訂立休戰條的為止，戰事共延長了四年又三個月一星期之久。</p>
<p>（五）參加大戰的國家，計有十九國。曾宜戰而未作戰的，有十一國。合計有三十個　家捲入漩渦之中。</p>

<p>名人軼事</p>
<h3>英外相哈里法克斯勳爵</h3>
<p>— 憶殷</p>
<p>同甘地是最要好的朋友　火車出軌還吃火腿炒蛋</p>
<p>哈里法克斯動爵，便是那雄視全球的大不列顚帝國的外相。他生於西歷一八八一年，現在已經五十九歲了。他的父親林特萊胡特爵士，是的克郡的望族，熱心於宗敎事業，曾經做過五十年的英國敎堂聯合會會長。所以當哈里法克斯幼年的時候，便深深地受着他父親的薰陶，不久以後，他便被送進了愛頓公學，但是因為他懶惰的緣故，常常被先生責罰，到現在，有人問起他，他還微笑地點頭承認。</p>
<p>從愛頓公學畢業以後，他便進了牛津大學。這裏是要做政治家的唯一捷徑，那時候，便認識了傑弗洛魯濱孫，就是現在泰晤士報的總主筆唐遜爵士，並且變成了很好的朋友。</p>
<p>一九〇八年，他一十八歲，便和奧斯勞女士結婚，到一九一〇年，他便被選進了國會，當時其他的職員都看輕他，譏笑他，但是隔不了多少時候，因為他的毅力和智慧，漸漸地沒有人敢輕侮他了。</p>
<p>一九一四年歐戰發生後，他做過的克郡龍騎兵的團長，後來歐戰吿終，他被任為殖民部副大臣，在任內大得鮑爾溫的賞識，於是在一九二二年鮑爾溫第一决內閣期內，任敎育部大臣，後二年，改任農相，在一九二六年又改任印度總督</p>
<p>當這新職發表之後，孟買的英國僑民便預備大大地歡迎一番，什麼跳舞會，音樂會都佈置好了。但是左等右等，等了好久，還不見那位總督到來。後來却被人發覺他一個人，靜悄悄地在孟買敎堂一角裏祈禱。一到祈禱完畢，也不管人家的焦急，期望，便一口氣跑到甘地的居處，—這是英國總督從來沒有做過的事。—經過了短短的會談，二人立刻成了親熱的朋友，一直到現在，他們的信上，總是這樣的稱呼着：「我偉大的朋友」。</p>
<p>一九三一年，他從印度歸來，又任為敎育部大臣，一九三四年以後，又做過陸相，掌璽大臣。到最近的張伯倫內閣，他被任為外相。</p>
<p>他保有英國人典型的性情，—鎮靜，有一個故事到現在還留在人們的腦子裹：在一九二九年，他在印度總督任內，有一天他因為有事須乘火車到德里去，不料在半路上火車受人暗算，出了軌，人人都嚇得了不得，但是他呢，却一動也不動在餐軍裏安心地吃他的火腿炒蛋。因此英國下議院議長奧考諾常常這樣說：「無論何人看到哈里法克斯，便可知道他是個英國人了」。</p>
<p>他同鮑爾溫，格萊一樣，也喜歡鄉村生活，同時他也曾經說過，他寗願做狩獵總管，而不希望做首相。每星期末，他總要到加洛倍的采地去盤桓一兩天，他也很喜歡寫作，他曾出版過一本書，關於他家古堡中鬼的傳說。</p>

<h3>政治巨頭的保身術</h3>
<p>— 蛇行</p>
<p>雇用替死</p>
<p>古代的許多專制暴君，為了避免他人的襲擊，常雇用幾個替身，來做替死鬼。張良行刺秦皇，却中了「副車」，這是一個明證。時至今日，那些狄克推多，却都拜了秦始皇做老師。他們的確也有許多仇人，但是他們又不得不具有大無畏的精神，時常在羣衆前出現，所以「替身」這種職業，便應運而生。</p>
<p>這種替身，必須具有和狄克推多酷肯的面貌，同樣的身材，並且還要模仿雇主坐時的姿勢和行路時的步伐。這些替身的薪給是很優厚的。他們常藉副手，秘書，汽車夫，等名目出現於狄克推多的身旁。他們很秘密的生活着，羣衆從不會知道有他們的存在，甚至到他們被狙擊或死亡後，還是被嚴守着秘密</p>
<p>在莫斯科一個寒冬早晨，那天照例是一年一度的大檢閱。列寗墓旁的看台，擠滿了人。一位外國記者站在看臺後方靠近墓的地方。這時一輛汽車從克里姆林門馳來，在墓旁停下，一張熟悉的臉從車廂裏出來，「斯太林」大家歡呼着。但當全部眼睛集中他一身時，那位記者瞥見一隊高大的人穿着大氅，從另一個門很快的直向墓後走去。在圍得水洩不通的大隊中，大踏步走着的，那才是眞眞的斯太林。這羣人走過了，那記者便始終被兩個漢子監視着，直到檢　完畢。</p>
<p>希特勒起初是瞧不起那些雇用替身的，他常說：「德國人民對於我的愛戴，以及那黑衣衛隊，儘足保護了。」但有一决他乘火車跨過鐵橋時，受到了襲擊，於是他立刻雇用替身。希特勒第一個替身是汽車夫希來克。一年過後便死了，據說是患腦膜炎而死。但四星期後，眞相漸露：原來在一天希特勒從柏林驅車赴柏納時，希特勒做了駕駛者，希來克却代替德國元首坐在車廂中，用一頂尖頭帽子低壓前額。車子行在十字街頭，突然一顆槍彈飛來，車廂中的替身應聲而倒，駕車者馬上開足速率在駛二英里，然後停車，跨下汽車，除去帽子，吿訴旁人自己是希特勒。</p>
<p>墨索尼里很諱言別人為他而死。但在他一生六决胃險中，就有二人為他而死，那就是一九二三年他汽車夫的被殺，和數年後羅馬大公的殞命。</p>
<p>替身中最勇敢的要推日本前首相岡田的替身了。那就是在一九三六年二二六東京政變中，一羣機關槍手衝破了岡田首相的宅門，進入鎖着的中門。他們在門外大聲地喊岡田出來受死。起先毫無動靜，正要破門入內時，突然門開了，一個年老肥胖闊口的人正向着他們，無疑的正是岡田。馬上一陣機關槍子洞穿了他的身體。幾天後叛徒鎭壓住了，整個東京悼着岡田的死，忽然首相私邸的碗櫉中，岡田出現了，旣餓且瘦，但却是活的。這又是一件他人庖代的錯殺事件呀！</p>

<p>科學趣話</p>
<h3>你所想不到的</h3>
<p>— 徐傑美</p>
<p>你知道嗎？世界上最奇特的東西就是你自己。我雖然不是算命的人，而且我也從來沒有見過你，可是我敢以五對一的比數跟你打賭，我能吿訴你許多你從來沒有想到的關於你本身的事。</p>
<p>擬不要以為白種人有西方人的相貌，其實白種人皮膚的色素比黑人還多，眼睛比黃種人還突；你以為人類的飲食是最合規則的，實在人類的食品中以草類為最多。</p>
<p>眼部的血脈流動得比身體上其他各部的血脈要快得多，因此牠能够很迅速地，準確地，不停地工作。可是你應該知道，你的視覺器官並不是眼晴。眼睛所見到的東西決不能多於照相機照出來的東西，牠不過受到光綫的刺激，把光錢集中在能感覺的一部分，然後由腦子把這些光錢化為幻象。所以視覺器官不是眼睛而是腦子；同樣地，攝影是膠片的工作而不是鏡箱的工作。可是，視覺不能只有腦子而沒有眼睛，正像攝影一樣，只有膠片沒有鏡箱也是不中用。</p>
<p>你可以實際觀察，用慣左手的人的左眼總比他的右眼要靈敏些。一個用慣右手的人的右眼一定比他的左眼要靈敏些；這雖然不是一條定理，却是一種普遍的情形。</p>
<p>即使你的眼睛沒有一點毛病，可是常牠們移動時，你正好像瞎子一樣，什麼都看不見。例如你在看書的時候，一行一行地看下去。你決看不見一行行的字在交替着的，你所見到的只是新奇的圖畫而已。</p>
<p>你看書的時候，看小見書上印的字，你所看到的只是字旁的空白，因為空白的反射力遠强於黑字的反射力。所以當你看見「〇」字時，你所看到的不是一個黑圈，而是在一塊白背景上周圍有一些模糊的影子的一塊白圓形。</p>
<p>我剛才不是跟你說過白種人皮膚的色素比黑種人多，眼睛比黃種人突嗎？這是實話，你要知道「白」是由各種色素混合而成，無論深紫或大紅所反射的光綫都及不上白色。而黑色却完全不反射光錢，所以黑種人實在是膚色最淡的人。</p>
<p>至於眼睛，你不要以為突眼是東方人的特徵。其實突眼是除了東方人以外世界上其他各種人的特徵。本來，東方人的眼睛是有一點突的，這是因為他們鼻梁太低的緣故。老實說一句，他們的眼睛還沒有西方人或是哥薩克人突得厲害呢！</p>

<h3>Polish Elite Break Through German Lines; Help Garrison Defend Warsaw with All Their Might; Fierce Battles on Northern and Southern Fronts as Polish Troops Hold Firmly to Original Positions; German Air Force Indiscriminately Bombs, Civilians Suffer Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>London – Warsaw Radio Station issued a message today stating that the elite troops of the Polish army have joined the aid operation for the Warsaw garrison. This unit fiercely broke into the city of Warsaw from the rear of the German army, and during the fighting along the way, they captured thousands of German soldiers. These prisoners and the reinforcements marched into the city together. (September 16th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Paris – According to the Polish Continental Wireless News Agency, German mechanized units attacked the outskirts of Warsaw yesterday but were repelled by the Polish army, suffering heavy casualties. A Polish military communiqué stated that the German army had launched three determined attacks on the outskirts of Warsaw, all of which were repelled. In the fierce fighting, the Polish army destroyed a German tank, seized several motorized vehicles, and a field gun. The enemy suffered significant losses. The war is being waged throughout Poland and has extended northeast to the Lithuanian border. (September 16th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>London – According to the latest Polish communiqué broadcast from Warsaw today, the German troops attacking from the northeast have been contained. In the central sector, the Warsaw garrison is now fighting fiercely to hold its ground. Further south, there is fierce fighting in Łowicz and Skierniewice. The German army has suffered significant losses, and there are no other changes on the front lines. (September 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Saliszczyki, Poland – According to reports from the front, the Polish National Army is firmly defending Lviv and valiantly resisting German mechanized units. This unit is quite strong and once broke through to the outskirts of the city, but was ultimately repelled by the Polish defenders. One German unit has advanced to a certain point in the eastern suburbs, so the retreat route for the Lviv defenders is in danger of being cut off. The artillery battle between the two sides is very fierce, and Polish defenses have been greatly affected. According to Polish sources here, the eleventh German mechanized detachment is currently advancing towards Brest. It is reported that several British officers were also in Lviv yesterday. (September 16th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Warsaw – The semi-official Pat news agency stated that the port of Gdynia in the north is still in our army's hands, and the battle situation is extremely fierce. On the southwest front of Warsaw, the line between the cities of Łowicz and Skierniewice, our army inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. East of Warsaw, the enemy attacked the cities of Białystok and Brest (i.e., Brest-Litovsk). After our army's valiant resistance and two days of fierce fighting, the positions remain unchanged. (September 15th, Havas)</p>
<p>London – According to the latest Polish news, the Polish army is putting up a very effective resistance, and the German strategy is providing the Poles with opportunities for guerrilla warfare to cut off their supplies, especially regarding gasoline. The German attacks on Białystok and Brest-Litovsk seem to be the most serious, as the Germans have the Königsberg-Białystok railway at their disposal. (September 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris – The hopes of Western countries that the Polish army could use a "Marne-style" battle to prevent German motorized units from encircling Warsaw and the Polish "security triangle" have dimmed today. This is because the Polish General Staff has already admitted that the Polish army failed to prevent German troops from breaking through the Polish army's left and right flanks. The Polish army's two flanks, south of the Bug River, near Sederje, changing to the east of Warsaw, passing the San River, through Przemyśl and the Galician oil fields south of Lviv. With the Polish army's two flanks having been defeated by the German army, the large Polish army in Warsaw, Kutno, Łódź, and Lublin will be in danger of being heavily encircled by the German army. Yesterday's German actions showed that the German General Staff intends to encircle the large Polish army to prevent it from retreating to the swampy area, because in that area of combat, the German army's powerful motorized units will lose their effectiveness. The Polish army in the Vistula River basin will face the threat of German troops from East Prussia attacking from the northeast. With the help of mechanized units, they moved south across the Bug River to Sederje, cutting off the transportation between eastern Poland and Vienna and Brest. This column has moved south towards Lublin and Radom. Military observers today were astonished to see that the famous Polish mud, despite continuous rain, still could not stop the German advance. French military experts still recall that Napoleon, after attacking Poland, wrote a book discussing Polish mud, saying that military strategists must consider Polish mud as the "fourth element" when preparing for Eastern campaigns. (September 16th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Warsaw – The semi-official Pat news agency has issued a message stating that the German air force is increasingly cruelly bombing our country's undefended towns and cities, and is wreaking havoc on displaced refugees, whether they are traveling by train or on foot. These people are defenseless and can only await death. When a factory in Lviv in the south was destroyed by German aircraft, some eyewitnesses saw that in addition to military pilots, there were also several non-military personnel and women participating in the operation. At 4 p.m. yesterday, eighteen German aircraft flew to the northeastern city of Vilnius (near Lithuania) and bombed it, dropping 200 bombs on the city center. The losses in the city were very heavy, and there were many civilian women and children killed and injured. It is still difficult to determine the exact number for the time being. (September 16th, Havas)</p>
<p>Krzemieniec, Poland – Local officials here have declared that German aircraft have repeatedly strafed Polish refugees on various highways with machine guns. The German authorities have also publicly stated that their aircraft will indiscriminately bomb all undefended cities. To date, the cities of Sederje, Lublin, and Częstochowa have been reduced to rubble. The city hall and opera house in Warsaw have been burned down. Countless towns have been completely destroyed. Many compatriots have died in various places and can only be buried hastily in nearby parks and fields. (September 15th, Havas)</p>
<p>Lviv – The radio station here issued a message stating that 20,000 civilians were killed by bombing when German aircraft bombed the city. Civilian casualties exceeded military casualties. Many Polish towns and cities have been attacked by German aircraft, including Sederje and Częstochowa. German aircraft flew extremely low, almost touching the trees, and used machine guns to strafe refugees on the road. After a Polish aircraft was shot down by German aircraft, the German army used the aircraft to machine-gun the Polish pilot. (September 16th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Zaleszczyki, Poland – German aircraft are still bombing undefended cities in Poland and strafing civilians with machine guns at low altitude. More than eighty residents of Komarów were killed, and many residents of Łuck were injured. The car carrying personnel from the British Embassy in Poland was shot at by German aircraft between Krzemieniec and Nyrówopol yesterday, but fortunately, it was not hit. Furthermore, as a result of the bombing of Krzemieniec on the 12th of this month, 30 residents died and more than 100 were injured. (September 15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin – According to a communiqué issued today by the German High Command, Przemyśl and Białystok have been occupied by German forces. The German army on the southern route is currently engaged in clearing out the remnants of the Polish army on the southern route. At present, there are battles at all the entrances to Lviv and the Tanne area near Pilica. Przemyśl has been captured by German forces, and motorized units have now reached the area of Złoczów. The military operation to encircle Kutno has been intensified since reinforcements arrived. The Polish army attempted to break through the German lines southeast of Warsaw but was repelled. The German army captured a total of 8,000 Polish soldiers and 162 cannons. The German army is now approaching Warsaw. The suburb of Praga-Południe has been occupied by German forces. The battle to attack the city of Brest-Litovsk is currently underway. (September 16th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Germany Prepares for a Protracted War; Defensive Posture Temporarily Adopted on the Western Front; Residents Being Evacuated</h3>
<p>Danzig – Foreign observers here recently stated that the German authorities, having gradually lost hope for a swift and peaceful end to the war, are preparing to evacuate a large number of residents from various places in the west, and further restrict food consumption to plan for a protracted conflict. A correspondent for a "political newspaper" here telegraphed from Berlin, saying: "The German government is deeply aware that the hope for a quick victory is extremely slim and is eager to resolve the Polish issue in a short period of time first, so that it can concentrate its forces on the Western Front. Even the Germans do not deny that preparations on the Western Front are not yet perfect." It is rumored that the German army hopes to adopt a defensive posture as much as possible on the Western Front this winter and begin a real large-scale war in the spring. In addition, a correspondent for the "Berliner Zeitung" stationed in Germany telegraphed: "The German government has already begun evacuating residents in the west, totaling no less than 18 million to 20 million people, and will soon intensify the effort." (September 15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Hitler Flies to Inspect the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Berlin – According to an official report issued by the Führer's headquarters, Führer Hitler flew to the front lines yesterday to inspect the situation. As he flew over Upper Silesia and the Kraków industrial area from Przemyśl to Galicia, he was pleased to see that all industries were intact and that shops and factories were operating as usual. Hitler then personally inspected two German divisions crossing the San River, most of which were Austrian provincial troops. (September 16th, Haitong)</p>
<h3>Upper Silesia Merged into Germany; Göring Inspects Industrial Zone</h3>
<p>Berlin – The Chief Civil Administrator of Upper Silesia, stationed in Katowice, yesterday issued two decrees announcing the re-integration of the eastern part of Upper Silesia into Germany. The checkpoints between the eastern and western parts of Upper Silesia have been abolished, restoring the German borders before 1919. At the same time, it is stipulated that various wages, salaries, and commodity prices in the eastern part of Upper Silesia will be the same as in other parts of Germany. Yesterday, a coal train left for Germany, and factories have resumed work one after another. Postal and telephone services will also return to normal within a few days. (September 16th, Haitong)</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland – German radio stations recently broadcasted a message saying that the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, General von Brauchitsch, visited Łódź, Poland (southeast of Warsaw) yesterday. Air Force Commander-in-Chief Göring, after visiting Führer Hitler, went to inspect the industrial zone in Upper Silesia to reform the original factories in Poland to suit German military needs. It was also said that Poland was incited by the United Kingdom to fight, so the United Kingdom should be responsible for its defeat. Other countries should take Poland as a warning. As for the British blockade policy, it is indeed a terrible weapon, but it will affect neutral countries rather than Germany. In the future, Germany will impose a more effective blockade on the United Kingdom. (September 15th, Havas)</p>
<p>Breslau – The leader of the German Labor Front, Mr. Ley, visited the Schalen zinc mine in the industrial area of Upper Silesia this afternoon. This mine was still in the hands of the Poles ten days ago, and it has now fully resumed production. Since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, Poland has occupied 8,700,000 square meters of German zinc ore, while Germany only retains 2,600,000 square meters. (September 15th, Haitong)</p>
<h3>Polish Air Force Warriors Achieve Commendable Results; Ram Enemy Aircraft, Perishing Together</h3>
<p>Paris – According to a broadcast message released today by the Polish official news agency, a certain Polish airman, after using up all his ammunition, was surrounded by twelve German bombers. The airman then piloted his aircraft to ram the largest of the German aircraft, perishing together. After this incident, many Polish airmen have imitated his actions. In an air battle near Modlin, a Polish pilot, after being wounded by bullets, piloted his aircraft to collide with a German bomber, resulting in both aircraft catching fire and being destroyed. The wounded Polish pilot managed to save his life. (September 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Situation of French and German Front Lines on the Western Front</p>
<h3>German Counter-Offensive on the Western Front Repelled; French Troops Occupy Important High Ground; Threaten Siegfried Line from a Commanding Position; German Army Destroys Moselle River Railway Bridge</h3>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters issued War Report No. 25, stating: "All areas on the front line were very active last night. The enemy south of Saarbrücken used extremely fierce artillery fire. Our army continued to advance in many places east of the Moselle River. The enemy downstream of the Nied River (a tributary of the Saar River) first used artillery to bombard, and then launched a fierce counter-offensive, which was ultimately repelled by our army." (September 16th, Havas)</p>
<p>Paris – The French military strategy is to straighten the salient angles of the border line, with Saarbrücken as its nearest destination. According to military observers, the French army could have already occupied Saarbrücken, but for the sake of prudence, they want to occupy it only when the encirclement is completed without any flaws. (September 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris – The semi-official commentary on General Headquarters War Report No. 25 stated: "The German army launched a large-scale counter-offensive yesterday on the high ground between the northern end of the Warndt Forest and the Nied River but was repelled by the French army. The French army is advancing in a systematic manner, gradually occupying this high ground. The eastern part of this area is an excellent artillery base, possessing a commanding position. It can bombard the enemy's positions in Saarland and the entire Saar River basin and the Siegfried Line. The importance of its position is self-evident. The enemy is now fiercely bombarding the French army's rear lines of communication and using large numbers of infantry to counter-attack, hoping to contain our army's advance, but they were repelled by our army." (September 16th, Havas)</p>
<p>London – The situation on the Western Front has gradually attracted attention. Military observers here all say that the French army's recent attack on Sierck has put more pressure on the German army. General Gamelin, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces, is now proceeding with everything in an extremely cautious manner, and should not underestimate the strength of the German army. Many believe that the French army is currently in a position to announce the occupation of Saarbrücken, but it is still waiting for the encirclement of the city to avoid the risk of encountering setbacks. The French army that has advanced into German territory has now dug deep trenches and built high fortifications, and its position is very strong. The Allied air force is also clearly superior to the German air force. One thing that is particularly noteworthy is that the German artillery is limited to heavy artillery. In reality, the firing of field artillery will be more accurate, but if it moves within range, it is in danger of being destroyed by French tanks. (September 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters recently issued War Report No. 24, stating: "In recent days, the positions occupied by our army have been consolidated. The enemy's counter-offensive was ineffective and suffered heavy losses. The enemy used artillery to fiercely bombard our army's positions in a certain part of the front line. Enemy aircraft also joined the battle, flying very low over our front line, and were immediately repelled by our fighter squadrons." (September 15th, Havas)</p>
<p>Beijing – According to news from Luxembourg, the French army attacking the Moselle region has occupied the village of Perl, and the French army has now penetrated into the German border. The French army is now advancing along the road to Saarlouis. The fighting near the Luxembourg border is very fierce and continuous throughout the day. In order to prevent the French army from advancing, the German army destroyed a railway bridge over the Moselle River, causing metal fragments to fall into various villages and streets of Luxembourg in the area. Fortunately, the residents of the village had already evacuated. The German army was forced to abandon Perl in a hurry before they could destroy the railway bridge. (September 15th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris – According to a semi-official report on the military situation on the Western Front, French infantry have now occupied German strongholds north of Sierck. It is reported that several battalions of French infantry, assisted by tanks, have seized several important strongholds on the Saar front, including two villages and an observation post. The French army continued to advance yesterday and at night, despite the bad weather and the high-altitude fire of the German artillery. The German artillery stationed outside the Guébling line launched a counter-offensive, but failed to prevent the French army from improving the positions it had occupied at night. The important war in recent days has been to defeat the German attack in the Sierck area along the Moselle River. With the help of tanks, the French infantry not only drove the German troops back to their original defenses, but also occupied the common defense area to prevent their future counter-attacks. Thus, the general situation of the French army's front line in that area has been improved. When the German army retreated, they destroyed the railway line along the Moselle River as much as possible. Progress was also heard to be made in other locations on the Western Front, especially twelve miles west of the Saar. (September 15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Forced to Land in Soviet Territory</h3>
<p>Moscow – On September 15th, an aircraft of unknown nationality was discovered over Olevsk, Ukraine. Soviet troops shot it down with machine guns, forcing it to land near the village of Ruzhino. It was proven to be a German twin-engine bomber. The five crew members were sent to Kiev, and the original aircraft was guarded. (September 16th, TASS)</p>
<h3>German Submarines Still Active; Three Merchant Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>London – It is reported that the British cargo ship "Fanad Head" was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean today. This cargo ship belongs to the North Antrim Shipping Co. and has a displacement of 5,200 tons. In addition, the British fishing vessel "Lavalera" (displacement 290 tons) was also sunk today. This is the first fishing vessel to be lost since the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany. The captain and eleven sailors were rescued by a small boat. It is said that after sinking the ship, the German submarine also opened fire on it.</p>
<p>London – The Ministry of Information announced that the British-American oil tanker "Cheyenne" (8,825 tons) has been sunk by a German submarine. The crew members were all rescued by the Norwegian ship "Ietbark." (September 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London – The Belgian cargo ship "Oostende," returning to Antwerp from New York, was sunk by a submarine in the English Channel last night. All passengers and crew members were rescued by the Greek ship "Atlantic" and have landed in a certain coastal area of ​​England. Six sailors were seriously injured and have been sent to the hospital for treatment. According to the engineer of the "Oostende," Mr. Steen, no one saw the submarine. "I was in the engine room when I suddenly heard a loud explosion. All the lights on the ship immediately went out, and I heard several gunshots. We ran to the deck and saw that the ship had split into two. At that time, the sea was calm. The seven passengers and crew members went to the lifeboats to escape, and were soon rescued by the 'Atlantic.'" The owner of the "Atlantic" said that he had witnessed a German submarine. A student from the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, Mr. Clerck, also said, "I was on the deck when the 'Oostende' was hit by a torpedo. Passengers and crew members were very calm when they went to the lifeboats and there was no panic." (September 16th, Havas)</p>

<h3>The Soviet-Japanese Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and International Affairs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Soviet Union and Japan signed an agreement to cease hostile actions between the armies on the borders of Japan, "Manchukuo," the Soviet Union, and "Mongolia." The full text of the agreement, consisting of four articles, is published in today's news section. Simultaneously, the Soviet Union appointed Smetanin as its ambassador to Japan. Furthermore, there are reports that both sides will organize a commission to demarcate the border. Tokyo also announced that after the agreement is established, the two countries will continue to negotiate other issues.</p>
<p>The drastic changes in the international situation and the contradictions in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan have been frequently commented on by this newspaper. Regarding the Soviet-Japanese agreement, there is a need to address it from multiple perspectives. However, for the sake of clarity and to avoid repetition, we quote the following points from our recent editorials:</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union only wishes to observe the rise and fall of capitalist countries." (August 28th Editorial)</p>
<p>"Given the situation in Europe, the intentions and actions of the United States and the Soviet Union, which are sufficient to influence the Far East, are becoming increasingly important." (September 2nd Editorial)</p>
<p>"The highest form of diplomacy between the Soviet Union and Japan is to coexist peacefully without conflict. To say that the two countries can share adversity and be on the same front is a false assumption that goes against human nature. What does Japan expect? The Soviet Union has gone a step further with Germany from a non-aggression treaty to a military alliance. According to the alliance, the Soviet Union and Germany will join forces in Europe, thus Japan will obtain the most ideal opportunity." (September 9th Editorial)</p>
<p>"As for the Soviet Union, its principles, politics, economy, and military strategy are more complex than other countries in terms of what should be considered gains and losses. Therefore, its policies are most difficult to grasp, and its actions and changes are most likely to be different... In the Far East, it has no demands on Japan, nor is it afraid of Japan" (Ibid.)</p>
<p>We believe that the above points have not been shaken by the Soviet-Japanese agreement, and that some of the significance of the Soviet-Japanese agreement can be found in the previous analysis. If the Soviet Union has even greater ambitions, it is possible to take further action beyond signing the agreement to cease hostilities with Japan. However, as of today, we do not assume this.</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet-Japanese agreement, it should not be seen as a surprising move. The dispatch of ambassadors and the signing of agreements to coexist peacefully without conflict are normal diplomatic relations, within the highest limits of normal diplomatic relations, and not unexpected. Moreover, as evidenced by the resolution of the Changkufeng Incident last year, this agreement is the second compromise that Japan has been forced to make with the Soviet Union, and it is not a new one. Furthermore, Japan's prior replacement of the head of "Manchukuo" was to show sincerity to the Soviet Union, and it was not sudden. Moreover, the main internal reason for the conflicts between the two sides since early May was the joint manipulation by Germany and pro-German military personnel in Japan. It only created a more favorable environment for Germany to win over the Soviet Union. Now that Japan's pro-German dream has vanished, there is naturally no reason to support the tension between the Soviet Union and Japan. From tension to peace is merely a retreat, not an expansion. Therefore, the essence of the Soviet-Japanese agreement is still a commonplace international dynamic. However, after the Soviet Union and Germany became friendly, Japan was particularly isolated. The cabinet change was intended to revise its international relations. Soon after, it was able to eliminate the tension with the Soviet Union. Therefore, even if there is nothing else after the agreement, and the essence of the agreement is said to be commonplace, from Japan's perspective, it cannot be denied as Abe's first achievement since coming into office!</p>
<p>Moreover, why did the Soviet Union sign this agreement with Japan? Regarding everything about the Soviet Union, we do not want to try to "guess". Therefore, when the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a treaty, many in the world claimed that the Soviet Union would have no worries about the West and would devote all its efforts to the Far East. We only believed that it "could" devote its efforts to the Far East, but "whether it will do anything is another question." Therefore, to say that the Soviet Union will do this or that after it and Japan agree to cease hostile actions would be premature. In short, to observe the intentions of the Soviet Union, we can only watch one step and know one step. Before it takes its second step, we have no way of knowing its intentions. What can be said is: (1) Many of the Soviet Union's actions over the years have not been understood by the international community. For example, its negotiations with Britain and France in Moscow were diligent and tireless, but it suddenly announced the establishment of a treaty with Germany. Therefore, those who criticize the Soviet Union say that it is insincere and untrustworthy. However, as we remember, the Soviet Union has never broken its word within the scope of its "actual commitments." The great disease and great mistake of the world is to mistakenly believe that the Soviet Union's insincere evasions, or general discussions of principles, or sincere interactions that have not reached maturity, have not reached conclusions, or have not been completed, means that the Soviet Union has already tacitly agreed, promised, and agreed. The Soviet Union does not believe that it should be bound by this, so it has never violated its obligations. The Soviet-Japanese agreement is like that, while China and the Soviet Union have a non-aggression treaty, committing to not conclude treaties with other countries that are detrimental to China, and committing to oppose aggression. Therefore, the Soviet-Japanese agreement should not be intended to be detrimental to China. Even if there are other actions with Japan after the Soviet-Japanese agreement, it should not be detrimental to China's resistance to aggression. (2) There must be a significant meaning behind the Soviet Union's interruption of its negotiations with Britain and France and its treaty with Germany, and it is not accidental. Now, Britain and France are at war with Germany. To infer the outcome of the war from the current stage, even those who are not happy with Britain and France cannot deny that Britain and France have an advantage, which is due to their economic power. The Soviet Union has no reason to sit idly by as Germany moves forward as much as possible, and has no reason to tolerate Germany's dominance over Europe, but it is also unwilling to see Germany completely defeated. Otherwise, if we do not unite with Britain and France to restrain Germany, and Germany concludes a treaty with the Soviet Union, it will be meaningless and akin to madness. However, as facts show, Germany first concluded a treaty with the Soviet Union and appeared to be isolated internationally, and now it is facing enemies on several fronts and will eventually be defeated. Britain and France have an advantage over Germany, and the cowardly and contemptible elements in their countries are plotting to induce Japan to increase their influence. At the same time, Japan, in the international community, is extremely isolated after being abandoned by Germany due to its past grievances with the Soviet Union. It is trying to maintain its advantageous conditions and get closer to Britain and France. All of this is what the Soviet Union does not want to sit idly by and let Britain and France collude with Japan. Knowing that Japan is particularly wary of the Soviet Union, it is therefore more willing to be friendly with Britain and France. When Japan reorganized its cabinet, hoping to dispel suspicion, it quickly agreed to conclude an agreement to cease hostilities. Therefore, to say that it has affection for Japan is more like helping Germany and encouraging Japan to deal with Britain and France. If the Soviet Union does not have this intention, its impact on objective facts will undoubtedly be to increase Japan's courage to blackmail Britain and France!</p>
<h3>The Establishment of a Soviet-Japanese Armistice Agreement on the Mongolian Border: Cessation of All Hostile Actions Yesterday; Both Sides to Immediately Survey the "Manchu"-Mongolian Border; The Soviet Union Appoints Smetanin as Ambassador to Japan</h3>
<p>Moscow – As a result of talks between Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in recent days, an agreement has been reached between Japan "Manchukuo" and the Soviet-Mongolian side as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Japan "Manchukuo" army and the Soviet-Mongolian army will cease all hostile actions at 2:00 PM Moscow time on September 16th.</p>
<p>2.  The Japan "Manchukuo" army and the Soviet-Mongolian army will each remain in the original occupied lines at 12:00 PM Moscow time on September 15th.</p>
<p>3.  The representatives of the local armies on both sides will immediately implement Articles 1 and 2 of this agreement.</p>
<p>4.  Prisoners of war and corpses should be exchanged. Regarding this matter, the representatives of the local armies on both sides should immediately consult and implement it.</p>
<p>In addition, as a result of the talks between Togo and Molotov, both sides agreed that the Soviet-Mongolian and Japanese "Manchukuo" sides will each send two representatives to establish a committee as soon as possible to survey the exact border between the Mongolian People's Republic and "Manchukuo" in the area where the recent conflict occurred. The committee should begin work immediately after it is established. (TASS dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow – The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has recently appointed Smetanin as Ambassador to Japan. (TASS dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow – According to reliable sources, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov for four hours yesterday. It is heard that this conversation, regarding the armistice on the Outer Mongolian border, is nearing its final stage. There are also rumors that the Soviet Union and Japan are about to conclude a non-aggression treaty, but this has not been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Observers from various countries here have recently commented on the agreement reached between Japan and the Soviet Union on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, saying that each country hopes to resolve various outstanding issues, and that general relations can be improved as a result. Since the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, Japanese Ambassador Togo has notified the Soviet government that the Japanese government is willing to discuss various outstanding issues with the Soviet Union in the hope of establishing a peaceful solution. Up to this point, Japan has no objection to the positions taken by the Red Army near the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, which the Soviet Union considers to be the true boundary of "Manchu"-Mongolia. This is also another clear indication of the country's moderate attitude. However, the saying that Japan and the Soviet Union should negotiate a non-aggression treaty is at least premature. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow – According to well-informed sources here today, the settlement of the Nomonhan conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union originated in Berlin. From this, it can be seen that the Axis powers are still active diplomatically. However, the Japanese side here is doubtful about the possibility of the Soviet Union and Japan concluding a non-aggression treaty. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Bairshagaal – At 6:00 AM on the 16th, the headquarters of a certain Japanese army issued an order to the soldiers in the Kherlengiin Heer steppe to immediately cease the attack. After this order was issued, the reporter saw a Japanese reconnaissance plane flying low to the south, and the Soviet infantry did not fire a single shot at it. Also, the Soviet mechanized unit was ordered to return to the Red Army warehouse at this time. Therefore, the military forces of Japan and the Soviet Union have returned to harmony and are stationed in their respective territories. The flags of the Soviet Union and the two countries are flying high on their national territories. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement at 1:00 PM today, saying that the Japanese government is making efforts to resolve the various outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, and that the governments of Japan and the Soviet Union both believe that the resolution of the dispute in Nomonhan, "Manchu"-Mongolia, can remove the unpleasant atmosphere between the two countries and promote the normalization of national relations. Ambassador Togo met with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov several times, and as a result of the negotiations, an armistice agreement was reached between the two countries on September 15th. (Domei dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Army Department of the Imperial General Headquarters announced at 1:00 PM this afternoon that the Outer Mongolian Soviet army in the Nomonhan area increased its forces on August 20th and attacked both sides of the Japanese army's position. The Japanese side also increased some forces to continue fierce fighting, and both sides suffered considerable losses. However, after the war gradually calmed down in September, the authorities of Japan and the Soviet Union conducted diplomatic negotiations, and today the two sides agreed to decide on an armistice. (Domei dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The newspapers here expressed satisfaction with the establishment of the border armistice agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan, and public bonds also rose unanimously. According to the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, after Japanese Prime Minister Abe announced the adjustment of diplomatic relations with foreign countries, he telegraphed Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo to seek a way to resolve outstanding issues with the Soviet Union. After receiving the order, Togo signed the armistice agreement with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. It is expected that after the general principles are determined, the committee for demarcating the border will soon go to the scene of the incident to meet. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Although the Chinese community knows that the Soviet Union and Japan are conducting negotiations in Moscow, the news of the signing of the armistice agreement between the two countries has caused great fear. It is the public's opinion that the United States must now pay close attention to the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan, as Japan can act freely in Asia and may further infringe upon the interests of the United States in the Far East. Some say that the establishment of the agreement will not affect the Soviet Union's aid to China, as the Soviet Union continued to aid China after the establishment of the Changkufeng armistice agreement in the past. The Chinese political community currently has no comment on this matter, which was expected, because the Japanese are eager to clear up the border war in order to concentrate on dealing with China. The Chinese community is now eagerly awaiting news of continued developments. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington – American officials are unwilling to express opinions on the Soviet-Japanese "Manchu"-Mongolian border armistice agreement until more detailed conditions are obtained. According to the Soviet-Japanese agreement, it is not sudden due to the fact that the Japanese side has already spent a lot on the war against China and does not want to have any more disputes with the Soviet Union. Secondly, Japan wants to take advantage of the opportunity of the European war to do some good business, so it started by signing a peace treaty with the Soviet Union to stimulate its foreign trade. American officials expect that the Japanese side may soon establish a new agreement with the United States, as for the Soviet Union, it is happy to establish an armistice agreement with Japan because it intends to deal with Poland. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>New York – After the establishment of an armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, the morning papers here are saying that the Soviet Union's policy is to expand the European war into a world war. The New York Times reported, "Some say that the Soviet Union and Japan established an agreement in order to prevent Germany from advancing too far, and another says that the establishment of an agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union is the inevitable result of the establishment of a non-aggression treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union. Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan may even establish an agreement as the first step in a new division of European countries. Senator Borah, who had just given a speech last night, argued that the United States should stay out of the European war, and who knows that this kind of war has affected half of the world." The Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao used the word "unfathomable," saying, "If we cannot speculate on the Soviet Red Army's desires for Eastern Europe, then we will also be unable to understand the circumstances under which Japan made peace with the Soviet Union. In short, what is the goal of Japan's peace with the Soviet Union? It will not be easy to know until the Soviet Union takes action." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Political figures here have recently commented on the establishment of the armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, saying that this is an "expected event." Each country should also establish a non-aggression treaty in the short term. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Political figures in Berlin welcomed the Soviet-Japanese agreement to resolve the Manchu-Mongolian border dispute. It is also recalled that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop said when signing the German-Soviet non-aggression pact that the conclusion of this pact would not only benefit German-Japanese friendship but would also be beneficial to German-Japanese friendship. The Germans hope that this will be the first step towards a Soviet-Japanese peace agreement, and that understanding between the Soviet Union and Japan can be guided by this.

<h3>The Soviet Union Remains a Huge Enigma in the European Situation; The Intention of the Army Mobilization is Difficult to Predict; The Soviet-Japanese Armistice Adds to the Suspicion</h3>
<p>London – According to a diplomatic correspondent for Reuters, the Soviet Union remains a huge enigma in the current European situation. After refusing to offer Turkey and Britain a mutual assistance agreement and signing a non-aggression pact with Germany, it was generally believed that the Soviet Union did so in order to be able to act freely in the Far East and avoid worries about the West. However, since then, things have changed very quickly, and now it is suddenly heard that the Soviet Union has signed an armistice agreement with Japan. It is the public's opinion that after this move, it may be followed by a small non-aggression agreement, so that Moscow will have no worries about the future and can act freely in Europe, which is not entirely unexpected. How the Soviet Union will use this freedom is a major question today. Recently, the Moscow Pravda published an article saying that the ten million Ukrainians and Belarusians in Poland have been abused, implying that the Soviet Union will make demands on Poland. The report also put forward two possibilities: (1) The Soviet Union may have signed an agreement with Germany to divide Poland; (2) Moscow may be alarmed by the rapid victory of the German army in Poland and is now preparing to demand certain territories in Poland if the German army advances too far. The Soviet Union's mobilization of four million troops to implement one of the above two points can be seen as the Soviet Union has made every effort to prepare for the worst. Germany's attitude towards the Soviet Union also seems to be in the dark and disturbed, just like the rest of the world. According to the correspondent, the Soviet-Japanese armistice can enable the Japanese to concentrate on dealing with the China incident, but it is still a point of contention whether Japan is convinced of this armistice agreement and dares to slightly withdraw its 300,000 troops stationed on the Soviet-Mongolian border to join the war against China. It cannot be believed that the suspicion between the Soviet Union and Japan can vanish overnight, and the same can be said of Soviet-German relations, and even more so. In short, the signing of the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement has not clarified the overall situation, but has only added to the new confusion. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris – Political figures here have recently commented on the establishment of an armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, saying that the reason why the Soviet Union is willing to end the five-month-long state of hostility is because the country is more actively involved in European affairs. Even if Japan's neutrality is temporary, the Soviet Union can take this opportunity to shift its attention to the current situation in the West. Although the easing of Soviet-Japanese relations is due to the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, another clear proof can be obtained that the so-called basic principles of National Socialism have no fixed nature. The signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Japan and Germany violates the principle of racism, while the signing of the non-aggression pact by Germany and the Soviet Union contradicts the principle of anti-communism. Today, Japan, which signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, has reconciled with the Soviet Union, which has always been called its number one enemy. It is unknown how to reconcile the fact that the Soviet Union's activities in the Far East are one of the reasons for Japan's war against China. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Two Factions of the US Congress Engage in Off-Site Propaganda War; Roosevelt's Proposal to Congress Will Be Limited to Amending the Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt told reporters today that he intends to limit his recommendations to Congress at a special session on the 21st of this month to amendments to the Neutrality Act. President Roosevelt will send a message to Congress, stating that the message will take the form of a speech to a joint session of the House and Senate. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington – Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, after President Roosevelt decided to convene a special session of Congress on the 21st of this month, people from both sides in favor and against the amendment have begun to debate. Republican Senator Borah recently gave a speech here, opposing the abolition of the arms embargo clause, with two arguments: (1) Abolishing the arms embargo clause would obviously benefit Britain and France, which would violate the meaning of neutrality; (2) What the government is doing here is not trying to maintain peace, but trying to help Britain and France. If we follow this path, the United States will inevitably be dragged into the whirlpool of war. However, a certain newspaper immediately refuted this, saying that if the arms trade is indeed regarded as a violation of neutrality, then other goods used for war, such as copper, cotton, and kerosene, should also be subject to embargo. Moreover, Borah deliberately confused isolationists with "peace advocates" in his speech and referred to those who advocate amending the Neutrality Act as "war advocates," the intention of which is obviously to confuse public opinion and make them believe that the United States' amendment to the Neutrality Act is a move towards war. But in reality, the United States will not join the war unless Germany takes some action to anger American public opinion. According to political figures, it can be seen from Borah's speech that he does not want to win people over with reason, but only to stimulate national emotions. In addition, Republican Senator Nye also opposed the abolition of the arms embargo clause, believing that after allowing arms to be shipped to the belligerent countries, the arms merchants and financiers would use it as a source of profit and provide credit loans to the belligerent countries, which could result in the United States joining the war to protect the safety of this investment. As for Republican Senator Vandenberg's opposition to arms exports, it is based on domestic political reasons, because he believes that for the benefit of the party, it is necessary to oppose all policies promoted by President Roosevelt. In short, even if a certain issue is not within the scope of party disputes, if President Roosevelt has any claims, it must be opposed. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the special session of Congress has been scheduled for next week, and that the topic of discussion will be limited to amending the Neutrality Act. He also said that he does not intend to ask Congress to draft special legislation restricting monopolies, as all plans should be implemented in accordance with the principles of peacetime. The President also said that the scope of American territorial waters should be divided according to the needs of the national interest. Accordingly, the US Navy often carries out "neutral patrols" within its sphere of influence. At this point, a reporter asked whether the scope of territorial waters included the Rhine River in Europe. The President smiled and replied that this definition only applies to "salt water." Also, Democrats believe that after the arms embargo clause is abolished, the majority of Democrats in Congress can be re-coordinated, so they are optimistic about the future. It is reported that the Democratic isolationist members of Congress will unite with the Republican members of Congress to repeatedly oppose the bill proposed by the President. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington – Famous American aviator Colonel Lindbergh broadcast to the nation last night, advocating that the United States not participate in the European war. He said, "If the United States participates, millions of American lives will be lost in the war. We must never participate in the European war. If anyone advocates participation, they must be crazy and will endanger American democracy. If we fight for European democracy, our own democracy will perish. The United States has great naval, land, and air forces and is absolutely not afraid of foreign aggression. The current conflict in Europe is a quarrel in their large family's long history, and this quarrel is caused by the mistakes made in the last Great War." (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan Decides to Temporarily Maintain the Exchange Rate with the US Dollar</h3>
<p>New York – Banks here received formal notification from officials yesterday that Japan has decided to temporarily maintain the exchange rate of one Japanese yen to 23 and 5/16 US cents. Economic circles say that this is an abandonment of Japan's previous policy of maintaining the price of one Japanese yen to one shilling and two pence in British currency. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>New York Foreign Exchange Market Turmoil: Pound Sterling Plummets</h3>
<p>New York. Today, the New York foreign exchange market was extremely turbulent. The pound sterling opened at a new low of $3.73, but then rebounded, closing at $3.88, down two cents from yesterday. Although the Foreign Exchange Committee stated yesterday that the U.S. demand for U.S. dollars, whether related to settling pre-war pound sterling balances or current commercial dealings with the British Empire, could be settled in London at a rate of $4.02, by the time the market opened today, Britain had not yet implemented this promise. Although market participants believed that the details would be revealed soon, those holding pound sterling did not want to wait and rushed to sell, causing market chaos. This is the main reason for today's sharp drop in the pound sterling. Amsterdam was a major seller, and other countries were also involved in settlements. New York is the only place in the world market where pound sterling can be sold without restrictions, so many transactions have moved to New York. Normally, these transactions would have been completed abroad. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has sold thousands of pounds sterling from its account, but this has not been confirmed. The Shanghai legal tender fell below the price of seven U.S. dollars in today's market. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Visits Hull to Discuss Far East Issues: Japan Intends to Revise Trade Treaty; Toshio Shiratori Returns Home via the U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Kensuke Horiuchi visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday to discuss Far East issues. According to Horiuchi's statement to reporters, he did not make any suggestions regarding changing the current situation in the Shanghai International Settlement. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington. Secretary of State Hull met with reporters on the 15th and discussed the content of his meeting with Japanese Ambassador Horiuchi, saying, "Today I met with Ambassador Horiuchi and exchanged views on various issues between Japan and the United States. We intend to continue holding talks in the future." (Domei News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome. Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori, left for the port of Naples tonight to take a ship back to Japan via the United States. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome. Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori, left here yesterday, carrying a report he co-authored with Hiroshi Oshima regarding the relationship between Japan and the Axis powers of Germany and Italy. Because Mussolini met with Shiratori in the middle of last week, there is considerable importance attached to this report. It is widely believed that this report includes Japan's relationship with the Axis powers, and the Far East issue will also be discussed. Shiratori will detour through New York, Washington, and San Francisco and will meet with Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Kensuke Horiuchi in Washington. Both Shiratori and Oshima met with the Japanese military and economic delegation, which has suspended its trip to Germany and also returned to Japan yesterday. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington. Secretary of State Hull hinted at a press conference yesterday that Japan had wanted to renegotiate a new trade treaty with the United States to replace the one concluded in 1911, which had been abrogated. Someone asked the Secretary of State whether this issue was discussed during yesterday's meeting with Japanese Ambassador Horiuchi. Hull replied that specific details were not discussed, but it is believed that the issue was touched upon. Regarding the Japanese military's invitation to the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in Shanghai for talks, Hull said that he had not yet received a specific report, and that such a meeting might be held again to discuss the Japanese proposal to amend the defense plan for the International Settlement. The Japanese Embassy also issued a very interesting statement, saying that Japan's goal is self-sufficiency, but it is also striving to adjust foreign trade in this new environment. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Canada's War Effort</h3>
<p>London. The Information Department recently published an article entitled "Canada and the Current War," stating that during the last European War, Canada sent an expeditionary force of 620,000 men to Europe to assist in the war. Afterwards, 40,000 died or went missing, 12,000 died from injuries, and 141,000 were injured. This was the contribution of the Canadian Federation in the last European War. This time, it has again joined the war for the same reason. It is not difficult to imagine how much military force it can supply, as the Federal Parliament has recently passed a bill allocating 100 million yuan as temporary defense funds. Moreover, during the last European War, Canada's various industries were still in their infancy. Today, the federation's industry is highly developed, and its material contributions will certainly be far greater than before. In addition, Canada, among all the autonomous dominions of the British Empire, is the closest to the British mainland and is naturally the most convenient source of supply. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Romania Defends Neutrality: Implements Various Precautions</h3>
<p>Bucharest. Romanian Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu issued a statement yesterday declaring that, in view of the events on the Baltic border, the Romanian government has decided to take the following steps to safeguard Romania's neutrality: (1) From a humanitarian standpoint, the right of asylum will be granted to all children and injured persons; (2) Any soldiers or troops who flee into Romania will be immediately disarmed and detained until the end of the war; (3) Polish government officials must still reside in the area designated by Romania and must not engage in any further political activities; (4) All private individuals fleeing from Galicia are not allowed to enter Romanian territory. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<p>Bucharest. Romanian Gendarmerie Commander Marinescu, along with Romanian Ambassador to Poland Grigore Gafencu, arrived yesterday at the Cristești station on the Romanian border. The station is separated from the current Polish capital, Tsariscisky, only by the Dniester River. It is widely believed that the arrival of the two men at that location is in preparation for receiving the Polish President and other government officials. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>France Invests Heavily in Poland</h3>
<p>Berlin. According to reliable statistics, foreign investment in Poland in 1938 reached 1,500,000,000 złoty, of which France accounted for the most, totaling 185,000,000 złoty, or 27%. The United Kingdom ranked second, accounting for 5.5%. Therefore, most of Poland's important factories and public utilities are controlled by foreigners, especially French investors. Prominent examples include the construction of the port of Gdynia, the railway between Upper Silesia and Gdynia, and the exploitation of the Sandomierz coal mine and the oil fields of Upper Silesia, all of which were largely invested in by France. At present, the power over the national railways of Poland is entirely in the hands of the Franco-Polish Railway Company, which was formed in 1931. According to last year's annual report, the company reached 376,000,000 francs, most of which were owned by French people. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>Lux Resigns from U.S. Treasury Advisor Position: To Become General Manager of Universal Trading Corporation</h3>
<p>Washington. Lux, technical advisor to the Treasury Department and director of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, has recently resigned. His vacancy is slated to be filled by Goklan, former financial counselor at the embassy in France. It is rumored that Lux will take the position of general manager of the Universal Trading Corporation, which was established by the Chinese side and is currently using the US$25 million in credit granted to China by the U.S. Federal Export-Import Bank last year to purchase trucks from the United States.

<h3>Rumors of German-Soviet Understanding: Division of Spheres of Influence in Eastern Europe; Large Soviet Army Concentrated on Western Border; Romania in Fear and Apprehension</h3>
<p>The Hague. Reliable sources in Berlin recently reported that German political figures have said that after recent talks between Germany and the Soviet Union, they have decided to divide up Eastern Europe as follows: (1) The Soviet Union, when the war between Germany and Poland enters its final stage, will cooperate with Germany. Once Poland is defeated, the areas inhabited by the Little Russian ethnic group north to Vilnius and the Ukrainian ethnic group south to Lviv will be occupied by the Soviet Union; (2) Two buffer states will be established between Germany and the Soviet Union: (a) "Little Poland" in the south, nominally an independent country but actually controlled by Germany, similar to the control of Slovakia; (b) Lithuania in the north, and the city of Vilnius will be returned to that country (Vilnius originally belonged to Lithuania, but was occupied by Poland in 1920). This division can be said to be a correction of the existing unfair situation on the surface, similar to Germany allowing Hungary to occupy Czechoslovakia's Carpathian Ruthenia province in March of this year. In addition, the Soviet Union will also invade and occupy Estonia and Latvia in the north (the Soviet Union has long coveted the ports of these countries on the Baltic Sea and can now achieve its wishes) and invade and occupy Romania's Bessarabia province in the south, controlling the Tatar Strait, in accordance with its traditional policy. From then on, the port of Istanbul in Turkey will no longer be controlled by Britain. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris. The Soviet Union is stepping up its "partial mobilization" and sending a large army of 4 million men to the west as quickly as possible. Although the Soviet Union has not explained the reason for the concentration of the army in the west, it was generally believed here last night that this was a military preparation to ensure that the Soviet Union recovers and occupies the Ukrainian and Belarusian territories, which were ceded to Poland under the Treaty of Versailles. Polish sources here firmly believe that there is an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union to return this territory to the Soviet Union as the price for the Soviet Union's signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. It is widely believed that the territory the Soviet Union wants to return is barren, mostly swamps and difficult-to-pass valleys, with no oil, agriculture, or mineral resources. However, this area is a natural boundary between the Soviet Union and German-occupied Poland. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland. Regarding the mobilization of the Soviet army, the correspondent of the Basler Abendzeitung in the Finnish capital recently reported that "Most of the reserves mobilized by the Soviet Union have been transferred to the Polish border. Only a small part has been sent to the borders of Estonia, Latvia, and Romania to strengthen the defense forces. The troops stationed on the Finnish border have not been strengthened. The capitals of various Eastern European countries believe that the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact does not involve the division of Poland, but only stipulates that the signatory countries have the obligation to consult each other. At this moment, the Soviet Union is probably preparing to consult with Germany. A certain diplomatic source in that country once declared, "Negotiations with German leader Hitler cannot be approached with a virgin's attitude. The Soviet government intends to transfer one-third of the Red Army to the Polish border, which is actually the preparation for the start of negotiations with Germany." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow. After the Soviet government implemented mobilization, the total number of army personnel has been raised to at least 4 million. All of the 1919 class of reserves and part of the 1918 class of reserves, totaling 600,000 men, have been called up. In addition, 145,000 young men from the 1920 and 1921 classes, who had previously had their enlistment deferred due to their studies, have also been enlisted. In recent days, another 800,000 reserves from various classes have been enlisted. Those who have completed their service period but continue to serve due to the tense international situation are not included in the calculation. Slogans are now posted in front of each barracks, boldly proclaiming, "We do not want to occupy an inch of other countries' territory, but we will never give up an inch of our own land."

<p>Paris. According to today's news from Eastern Europe received here, Poles and Romanians are extremely apprehensive about the Soviet Union's military actions on their borders and are paying close attention to them. Romania has urgently transferred troops to the Soviet border to strengthen its defenses, as Romania firmly believes that the Soviet Union has ambitions to covet Bessarabia. Poles also firmly believe that the Soviet Union hopes to restore the pre-war borders and incorporate Polish Belarus into its territory. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium. The Belgian news agency recently received a message from its correspondent in Berlin stating that, according to German political figures, the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union has been defined by leader Hitler in his speech to the House of Representatives on the first of this month. In short, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is a practical solution. In the future, Germany will not accept any international discussions on various European issues without the participation of the Soviet Union. Moreover, in the future, if the Soviet government can exclude Jews and not allow them to hold important positions, such as the dismissal of Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov, then that country's policy can be said to be closer to Germany's current policy. In short, if the Soviet Union can become a nationalist country and its domestic system is not related to the Third International, this political significance can be said to be that Germany and the Soviet Union have already reached a practical agreement.

<h3>Chinese Air Force Conducts Major Operations in Shanxi Province: Large Number of Chinese Aircraft Appear Over the Datong-Puzhou Railway, Bombing Concentrated Japanese Troops and Convoys</h3>
<p>Chinese Air Force Plans to Maintain Strength of 500 Aircraft; Aircraft Manufacturing Plant Currently Being Established</p>
<p>Chongqing. The recent large-scale operations of the Chinese Air Force in Shanxi Province have attracted public attention. According to war reports from Shanxi Province, a large number of Chinese bombers appeared over the Datong-Puzhou Railway in southwestern Shanxi Province on September 8. Although they were subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese army, they were still able to descend and bomb concentrated Japanese troops and convoys, causing a large fire. On September 10, a train of Japanese troops traveling south on the Datong-Puzhou Railway was spotted by Chinese bombers, which immediately bombed it, destroying its engine and five carriages. It has been a year since Chinese aircraft conducted large-scale bombing operations. A year ago, Chinese aircraft bombed Japanese warships and transport ships in the Yangtze River downstream of Hankou almost every day, but then there was almost no news. In the past year, the commander of the Chinese Air Force has concentrated on training bomber crews and continuously importing new aircraft from abroad. Therefore, the resumption of activities by the Chinese Air Force has greatly excited the Chinese people here. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. The "Military Affairs Monthly," published by the Military Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission, contains an article by former Chinese Air Force Commander General Qian Dajun, stating that the Chinese Air Force plans to maintain a frontline strength of 500 aircraft, which will require a total of 41.7 million yuan, with annual maintenance costs of 33.2 million yuan. He believes that once the Chinese Air Force has a frontline strength of 500 aircraft, it will be able to launch an air offensive and curb enemy aircraft activities in the Yangtze River and coastal areas. General Qian believes that replenishment will be based on an average loss of 40%, but the losses of the Chinese Air Force have not yet reached this figure. China is currently building aircraft manufacturing and repair plants, but it still needs to import some raw materials from abroad and develop the metal industry to assist in the manufacture of aircraft. As for bombs, machine guns, parachutes, etc., China can manufacture them itself. General Qian estimates that it takes ten years to train an aeronautical engineer and one and a half to three years to train a qualified air combat pilot. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

The foundation of the Red Army's power lies in the unity and friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. This year, there are 145,000 young people with secondary education among the new recruits of the Red Army. This is a powerful force. All regimental schools and special forces will increase the recruitment of new troops with high cultural and physical standards. These young people will be trained as reserve officers. There are no illiterates among the recruits this year, and many of them possess various special skills, such as tractor and combine drivers, technicians, and pilots. The number of Communist Party members, probationary party members, and Communist Youth League members enlisting this year is also greater than in previous years. Therefore, the Red Army will have a large number of new cadres, making its strength even stronger. This recruitment of new troops is conducted in accordance with the new universal conscription regulations, the purpose of which is to further enhance the Red Army's power and expand its numbers. All this is proof of Stalin's concern for the military organization of the socialist state. The world is now plunged into the heat of war, and many countries have been involved in the war. The Soviet Union and its armed forces must have full military preparedness to avoid being overwhelmed by the raging waves." (15th TASS dispatch)</p>

<h3>German Oppression of the Catholic Church</h3>

<h3>Wuxi Autumn Cocoon Prices Initially Rise, Then Decline</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Autumn cocoons in Wuxi have been on the market for some time. Generally, small family-run silk industries, seeing soaring silk prices and a lack of raw materials, went to the countryside to prepay deposits, agreeing orally to prices of 170 or 180 yuan per dan, or even 200 yuan. However, when the autumn silkworms were about to spin their cocoons, the European war broke out, and silk prices plummeted from 4,250 yuan to 2,700 yuan. Silk merchants in the family-run silk industry, upon receiving this news, convened meetings and decided that the highest price for autumn cocoons would be 90 yuan per zu, gradually lowering the price. At the same time, some cocoon merchants voluntarily abandoned their deposits for rented cocoon shops, while others regretted and reduced the contract price, creating a very chaotic situation. The silkworm farmers in the surrounding countryside, having spent 15 or 16 yuan per dan on mulberry leaves, feared that cocoon prices around 100 yuan would not only fail to cover labor costs but would also result in large losses, causing great panic. On the 8th, news arrived from Shanghai that silk prices had rebounded by 600 yuan, and 80% factory silk could be sold for 3,300 or 3,400 yuan. Therefore, silk and cocoon merchants regained their courage and went to the countryside to purchase cocoons. On the first day, the traded price using the Sima scale was 150 or 160 yuan per dan. Later, news came from Shanghai that silk prices had risen to 4,000 yuan, and cocoon merchants from all sides began bidding competitively. Prices on the southeast route reached 250 or 260 yuan, with traded prices around 220 yuan. Prices on the northwest route were above 200 yuan. Silkworm farmers in general were overjoyed. However, a telegram arrived from Shanghai the day before yesterday, stating that silk prices had fallen back by 700 or 800 yuan, and the silk market was at a standstill. Therefore, cocoon prices had declined by the 12th. The highest price in the southern countryside was still 240 or 250 yuan.</p>

<h3>Wartime Food Substitutes in Fujian Province: Overview of the Production and Sales of Dried Sweet Potatoes; Liancheng County Has the Highest Production</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Liancheng is an important town in western Fujian, located at the center of Yongding, Ninghua, Tingzhou, Hangtou, and Longyan. The road network extends deep inland, making transportation very convenient. Handicraft industries, with paper as the main export, determine the prosperity or decline of the rural economy. Agricultural products are mainly rice, followed by sweet potatoes, which are the main supplementary food in the county. They can be made into dried sweet potatoes, which are famous throughout the eight prefectures of Fujian. Here is a brief description of their production and sales situation.</p>
<p>1.  Cultivation of Sweet Potatoes and Annual Harvest Volume: The raw material for making dried sweet potatoes is sweet potatoes, also known as mountain potatoes. It is a mistake to call them sweet potatoes, because although sweet potatoes are in the same family as sweet potatoes, they are another type of root crop. They can also be sliced and dried, but very few are produced in the county. The famous product is dried sweet potatoes. In addition to being made into dried sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes can be steamed, stir-fried, or made into noodles, dumplings, or ground into powder for cooking, or made into vermicelli, cooked and eaten to fill the stomach, and can also be used to make shochu, and can also be a good feed for livestock. Even the stems and leaves can be used as feed. There are three common methods for propagating sweet potatoes, which are described below: (1) Transplanting seedlings: First, loosen the soil, then apply fertilizer and dig holes, and then transplant the seedlings. The depth at which the seedlings are transplanted varies depending on the soil quality. Shallow transplanting is suitable for hard soil, and deeper transplanting is suitable for loose soil. Generally speaking, the soil should not be deeply cultivated, three or four inches is enough. If it is too deep, the roots will form in bundles and cannot expand, and the selling price will also be reduced. If sticky soil is encountered, it should be slightly deeper, to seven or eight inches, to suit its growth. This county often cultivates this crop in high ridges, one to prevent waterlogging and the other to facilitate harvesting. (2) Pulling seedlings: Plant sweet potatoes in the seedling bed. If the climate is suitable, buds and vines will grow within five or six days. When they grow to seven or eight inches, roots will grow, and they can be transplanted. When transplanting, dip the roots in mud to prevent drying. However, when pulling the seedlings, do not move the roots. After pulling, water immediately to keep the soil moist and attached. After two or three weeks, young shoots will grow again for propagation. This is the method of pulling seedlings for transplanting. (3) Inserting vines: The so-called method of inserting vines is that the sweet potato seedlings planted in the above method will grow vigorously in a few dozen days, and their stems can be cut off for transplanting. This method is the most common.</p>
<p>The planting season varies from place to place due to different climates, but generally it is carried out from ten days after the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar to the end of June. Harvesting is carried out from the end of October to November. During harvesting, the stems and leaves are cut off first, and then the sweet potatoes are dug out. The yield varies greatly depending on the coldness of the climate, the fertility of the land, and the amount of fertilizer applied. Some yield only ten dan per mu, while others can yield forty dan. Because of the shortage of rice in this county, planting is common everywhere. According to a survey in the 27th year of the Republic of China, the total output of the county was 40,000 dan, and less than 20% was used to make dried sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>2.  Method of Making Dried Sweet Potatoes: There are two methods for making dried sweet potatoes in this county, which are described separately below: (1) Whole-piece method: Take red-fleshed, white-skinned sweet potatoes, wash them clean, place them in a steamer to steam. After they are cooked, take them out and scrape off their skins, press them flat into pieces by hand, and then put them into bamboo cages and bake them over low heat until dry, and then they become red dried sweet potatoes. (2) Cut-strip method: Take red-fleshed, white-skinned sweet potatoes, wash them clean, peel them, cut them into strips, place them in a steamer to steam. After they are cooked, take them out and dry them in the sun, and then steam them again in a wooden steamer. They must be steamed and dried several times to become black-red sweet potatoes. Of the above two methods, the whole-piece method is more common, and more are exported.</p>
<p>3.  Nature and Uses of Dried Sweet Potatoes: There are two methods for making dried sweet potatoes, as described above. In terms of their nature, whole pieces are yellow in color and beautiful, sweet in taste, and shaped like joined fingers. Cut strips are brown in color, sweeter in taste than whole pieces, and very soft and glutinous. Both are easy to digest, and their greatest use is to replace food, which is beneficial and harmless to the body.</p>
<p>4.  Storage Methods: The storage methods for whole-piece and cut-strip dried sweet potatoes are different, which are described separately below: (1) Whole-piece storage method: Those that are newly made are not dried very thoroughly because the selling merchants want to maintain their weight, so they mold within two days of storage (turning white), and rot after a long time, because they often contain a lot of moisture. If you want to make them last, you must buy them back from the streets and alleys and bake them over a low heat until they contain no moisture. When eating them later, steam them in a rice steamer, and their taste and color will not change. (2) Cut-strip storage method: This type is more durable than the whole-piece type, because it has been steamed and dried several times, and the moisture is completely absorbed by the starch, and evaporated into a gelatinous substance, so there is no risk of spoilage if it is simply placed in a jar and sealed.</p>
<p>5.  Manufacturing Costs and Prices of Finished Products: Because sweet potatoes are very easy to plant and very abundant in harvest, the cost is low and the selling price is also cheap. According to a survey during the winter harvest season last year (late October to mid-November in the lunar calendar), 20 catties could be bought for every jiao, and every city dan only cost 5 jiao of national currency. After the harvest is completed, the price gradually rises. Those who make dried sweet potatoes purchase and store large quantities during the harvest period in order to manufacture them. Most of those engaged in this type of manufacturing are women. On average, each person can only make 10 to 15 catties per day. The selling price is one jiao per catty in winter and rises to 2 jiao and 5 fen per catty in spring. According to a survey, 100 catties of sweet potatoes can make 20 catties of dried sweet potatoes. Each catty is sold for one jiao, which can be sold for two yuan. In addition to the raw material cost of 5 jiao, the labor cost of 5 jiao, the fuel and miscellaneous expenses, and the damage to utensils, which are also calculated at 5 jiao, there is still a surplus of 5 jiao, which is quite profitable. During this time of war resistance, if we can universally promote and increase production, it will not only enrich the people's financial resources, but also increase the wartime food supply. It is suitable for use as military dry rations, which will be beneficial to the war of resistance and nation-building. Those who are concerned about the food problem should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong on the Verge of War: A Situation That Has Moved from Crisis to Relaxation; Crowds of Refugees Come and Go Frequently</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Japan's aggression against China has neither ended nor can it be sustained. At this stage, it is thinking of making things difficult for Britain, hoping to force Britain on the one hand to stop aiding China, on the other hand to "cooperate" with Britain, and on the other hand to force Britain to put pressure on the Chinese government to accept peace talks. As a result, the British concession in Tianjin suffered a blockade, and there were anti-British movements in the occupied areas. Finally, the Japanese army deployed troops on the border of Hong Kong, directly threatening Britain's only base in China. This happened after the 20th of last month. Under these circumstances, the British were outwardly calm, but inwardly very clear. Therefore, in addition to sending a large number of troops to the New Territories to increase defenses, and digging trenches on the Sino-British border, and blowing up the Shenzhen Weaver Bridge, they also publicly advised residents who could evacuate to do so voluntarily, and those who could not evacuate to store food in preparation for emergencies. In addition, they made various necessary preparations, such as the joint deployment of land, sea, and air forces throughout Hong Kong to establish a three-dimensional defense, the implementation of a blockade of Lei Yue Mun and Kap Shui Mun, and the promulgation of national defense laws and the implementation of postal and telecommunications inspections, and so on. During this period, the crisis in Hong Kong was in a state of great tension. However, like a thunderbolt, the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression pact, and Japan suffered an unexpected and serious blow, causing it to panic. The first important thing seemed to be to quickly turn around and curry favor with Britain. In this way, the situation on the Shenzhen side gradually returned to relaxation, and the crisis in Hong Kong passed in this way.</p>
<p>However, with the deterioration of the situation in Germany and Poland, the foreigners in Hong Kong were the first to evacuate, followed by the Chinese who left Hong Kong, either to Yunnan or to Shanghai. Those without money had to make necessary preparations, so some stored food, some stored firewood, some took advantage of ships to Macau, and some simply fled to the occupied areas. Within three or four days, Hong Kong had surprisingly seen one or two thousand people fleeing. When the German-Polish war officially broke out, the atmosphere in Hong Kong became even more tense. Thousands of people fled by waterway to Shanghai, Macau, and Guangzhou, especially to Macau and Guangzhou. Those with more money went to the Philippines. Finally, those who could not escape immediately or had nowhere to escape also quickly stored food and bought firewood. Prices of canned food, milk, oatmeal, biscuits, salted fish, noodles, and the like soared immediately, and the work of withdrawing deposits, obtaining passports, inquiring about sailing dates, and booking cabins was naturally as urgent as fighting a fire. Therefore, within two days, Hong Kong society was in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>But after two days had passed, the situation seemed to have stabilized again after a period of turmoil. Japan's announcement of a "non-interference in European politics" policy was like giving the people of Hong Kong a reassurance. And in fact, it was true. As long as Japan does not act in concert with Germany and Italy, Hong Kong can stand outside the war. Although the Hong Kong authorities' war preparations since September 1 were very appropriate, by September 7, except for slightly higher prices and slightly affected commerce, there was simply no sign of any "war" in other aspects. Therefore, those who were planning to escape no longer wanted to escape, and some of the evacuated foreigners returned. More interestingly, while some people continued to flee to Macau, others continued to flee back from Macau. The reason was that Macau was small and densely populated, and could not accommodate so many "Hong Kong refugees" no matter what. Therefore, most of those who fled could not rent houses. At the same time, Macau used silver coins (old Guangdong silver coins) and Hong Kong dollars. In peacetime, one Hong Kong dollar could be exchanged for about 14 cents, so the cost of living in Macau was lower than in Hong Kong. But when the European war broke out, the price of silver coins continued to rise. One Hong Kong dollar could not even be exchanged for ten cents, so the goods there were more expensive than in Hong Kong. Therefore, those who fled had to flee back again. Some of those who had not fled but were planning to flee wanted to go but stopped, while others insisted on going to Macau to experience the taste of fleeing. In this way, the five ships that travel between Hong Kong and Macau every day are announced to be full, whether going or coming.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Unremittingly Engage in Anti-British Movement, Also Advocating Boycott of British Goods</h3>
<p>Taixian dispatch: Japanese troops in Huaian city held a Pingju opera performance at the sports field a few days ago, taking the opportunity to conduct anti-British propaganda and advocate a boycott of British goods. Before the Pingju opera began, the traitor Sha Guizhang was active on the stage. A soft and hard plaque was erected on the stage, with the words "Thank the Imperial Army" written on it. Sha was wearing a dark green suit, a foreign-style straw hat, a Japanese sword around his waist, and a long red and yellow badge on his chest with the words "Huaian County Magistrate." He held an inauguration ceremony that morning, followed by a parade. His ugly behavior was shameful.</p>
<p>Japanese troops in Huaiyin, together with the puppet organization, have recently continued their anti-British movement. Yesterday, an anti-British rally was held at the public sports field in the city, forcing people to participate. Zheng Dazai, Huang Zihou, and Li Yushu were appointed as the presidium, with Japanese secret service chiefs and Japanese members of the pacification team monitoring from the sidelines. Only about 500 people, including attendees and members of the puppet organization, were present. After the meeting, they were forced to parade and shout slogans such as "Down with British Imperialism."</p>
<h3>Dinghai: Puppet Autonomous Association Disintegrates, Provisional Puppet Government Formed</h3>
<p>Dinghai dispatch: After the fall of this county, the Japanese army immediately wooed local gentry to form a puppet "Autonomous Committee," with the Japanese person Kurashige Yasuyoshi as the chief advisor, Chen Ermei as the puppet supreme advisor, and Ding Zisheng as the puppet "Chairman." Some former county government employees were forced to join the puppet organization, but the former employees, understanding the greater good, took the opportunity to resign one after another and go to the interior. These included Chen Yunqing, the puppet "Chief of the Civil Affairs Section," Chen Yongkang, the "Chief of the Finance Section," and Wu Dingfu, the "Inspector of the Public Security Section," among others. They have all reported to the Zhejiang provincial authorities on their forced participation in the puppet organization. Recently, the puppet association has announced its disintegration due to intense suspicion and friction among the factions. The Japanese are planning to organize a "Provisional Unified Government," but the members are complicated, and suspicion among the factions is intensifying. All "secretaries," including Wang Menglu, have been dismissed, and the puppet "Chairman," Ding Zisheng, has also been detained at the former site of the Suoshan Cooperative by the Japanese naval command.</p>
<h3>Hua Army in Lilizhen, Wujiang, Strategically Captures Puppet Troops, Disarming More Than Two Hundred People</h3>
<p>Suzhou dispatch: A certain unit of the Hua Army stationed in Lilizhen, Wujiang, recently found the puppet troops to be exceptionally cunning and difficult to attack. To implement a thorough suppression plan, they feigned surrender on the 8th. At that time, Xie Zhijun, the commander of the puppet troops in Wujiang, believed it to be true and, seeing that the Hua Army intended to negotiate, sent more than two hundred puppet troops, led by a company commander, to Lilizhen, hoping to be incorporated. Unexpectedly, the Hua Army, seeing the puppet troops arriving in large numbers, had ambushed them near the town. When the puppet troops landed, at a signal, they were surrounded from all sides. The puppet troops then realized they had been tricked but were no longer prepared. They shouted, "Chinese people don't fight Chinese people," and were willing to surrender with their weapons. A certain officer of the Hua Army, considering the puppet troops to be fickle, refused to accept their surrender. The seized weapons were reported to the superiors, and the captured puppet troops were forced to disband to avoid further disturbing the local area.</p>

<h3>Xinshi School Changes Head: Wu Ruinian Succeeds as Principal</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xinbo, the principal of Xinshi Vocational School on Chongqing Road in this city, has been in poor health for a long time and cannot bear the heavy workload.

<h3>Sino-French National Institute of Technology: No Turmoil or Confusion</h3>

<h3>Senior Singles Semifinals: Li Guofan Lost to Carson Yesterday: Carson Wins Straight Sets to Gain the Right to the Finals and Will Compete with Wang Wenzheng for the Championship</h3>
<p>In the senior singles semi-final of lawn tennis, Carson played against Li Guofan at the French Chamber of Commerce field yesterday afternoon in light rain. Carson, who dominates Shanghai, has rarely met his match. Yesterday, he still maintained his championship posture, long strokes and short blocks, all of which were handy. The forehand was powerful and accurate. Li was ultimately not as good and lacked experience. Sometimes he could not calmly handle the situation and missed many good opportunities. Therefore, the whole game was controlled by Carson. Li suffered a crushing defeat in straight sets. However, Li is a promising newcomer. He was first added to the senior division this year and was able to defeat strong opponents and enter the semi-final week, which is a fairly satisfactory result. The future is long. With more hard work, it will not be difficult to become a famous general. Failure is the mother of success. May Mr. Li encourage himself. With Carson eliminating Li Guofan to win the right to the finals, he will compete with Wang Wenzheng for the championship. The results of yesterday's game are as follows:</p>

<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Group Takes Out Foreign Exchange to Buy Gold: Unofficial Afternoon Price Reaches 4260 Yuan</h3>
<p>Although the trend of foreign exchange was stable and firm in yesterday's spot gold dark market, the price of gold continued to rise. This was because the Hong Kong group squeezed out foreign exchange and transferred it to gold, so the price of gold and foreign exchange have been moving in opposite directions recently. Therefore, the settlement price of foreign exchange was slightly rolled up, but according to the noon closing calculation, it was still lower by a huge 782.8 yuan to 1196.8 yuan. However, the situation on that day was still flat at the opening in the morning, remaining at 4130 yuan. After the opening, because the buying interest of the customer group was very strong, the price immediately soared to a high of 4220 yuan. After that, a certain Yu number and the silver shop group took advantage of the high price to sell, and money changers absorbed it whenever it was small. The two sides held each other, so the price rarely changed, hovering around 4200 yuan. As a result, the noon closing price was 4190 yuan, an increase of 60 yuan compared with the previous day. In the afternoon, because there was no market on Saturday, the off-market situation was even stronger. It is reported that the unofficial price reached as high as 4260 yuan. Trading was brisk for half a day, at around a thousand taels. The silver and gold shop together hung up 15 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold are in a fixed state.</p>

<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening was still flat, the market opened at 9:10, money changers mutually traded two taels, the price was still 4130 yuan.

In an instant, it rose by 90 yuan, the securities group bought 30 taels in total from the money changers and the silver shop group, all at 4220 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop came to take advantage of the high price to sell, and it was heard that foreign exchange was firm, and buyers turned to sell, so it immediately fell back 40 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 20 taels to the money changers, the price was 4180 yuan. Later, the money changers continued to absorb purchases on behalf of the local group, and then raised it again by 30 yuan, the money changers bought 30 taels from the silver shop group, for 4210 yuan.

<h3>Gold Pound Reaches 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies had little fluctuation because the exchange market was less volatile, so British and American gold notes did not rise or fall. However, the price of gold continued to rise, and the wealthy had a great demand for gold pounds, so the rise was particularly strong. The former has already reached the 100 yuan mark, and the latter has crossed the 100 yuan mark. As a result, each rose by 4 yuan, the French franc note also rose by one point, Singapore currency rose by one jiao, the Dutch note rose by five jiao, the Japanese gold note rose sharply again, once reaching 1.335 yuan, finally 1.33 yuan, an increase of 4.5%.

<h3>Oversupply of Cash Notes: Discount Rate Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange and bill notes was still in the low range, because the supply of cash notes exceeded the demand, and each thousand yuan initially hovered around 125 yuan, then retreated to 122 yuan, and near noon rose back to 125 yuan. In the afternoon, it once fell to 117 yuan, and finally was 110 yuan, down 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate of the Money Industry Association was still 20 cents.</p>
<h3>Sterling Weakening, US Dollar Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. In the unofficial market, the British and American exchange rate plummeted, shrinking by another five points to $3.88. Therefore, the morning opening showed continued weakness in sterling and strength in the US dollar, with sterling gold at 4 pence 0.015625 and the US dollar falling to $6.4375. However, the market was very dull midway, with very little trading, as operators were waiting to see what would happen. Due to the recent surge in commodity prices, many speculators in the foreign exchange market have turned to other opportunities, resulting in a booming stock market. However, due to some selling by Hong Kong interests, sterling gold closed firmer at 4 pence 0.03125 at noon, and the US dollar recovered to $6.50, slightly firmer than the previous day for sterling but unchanged for the US dollar. The trend for this month's futures was similar to the spot market.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the morning, the recent London cable rate rose by 0.0625, the forward rate rose by 0.05625, the New York silver price rose by 0.025, and London gold remained unchanged.

The US dollar fell sharply again by 0.05 against sterling, fell by 0.30 against Shanghai dollar, and fell slightly by 0.015 against French franc. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling price for spot transactions at banks in the morning was 4 pence 0.015625 for sterling gold and $6.46875 for the US dollar, which was 0.03125 lower for sterling and higher for the US dollar compared to the previous close, due to the fall in the exchange rate. After the opening, a certain bank absorbed spot US dollars from another bank at $6.50, which was relatively stable. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there was no change, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be up by 0.035. After that, Hong Kong interests entrusted brokers to release some spot sterling gold, and Chinese merchants also slightly dumped US dollars, but British banks and HSBC had good appetite, so the loosening trend was minimal. Hong Kong interests sold spot sterling gold to HSBC and other foreign banks at 4 pence 0.03225 and 0.0625, and Chinese merchants sold spot US dollars to foreign banks at $6.50. Thereafter, fewer transactions took place, and the process was uneventful. Near noon, foreign banks showed some willingness to sell spot US dollars at $6.50. By noon, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 pence 0.03125 for sterling gold and $6.50 for the US dollar. This month's sterling gold was 4 pence and the US dollar was $6.4375.

<h3>Securities: Fluctuations in Domestic Bonds, Wider Range, Vigorous Foreign Stock Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market saw a trend of weakness followed by firmness, but after rebounding, it seemed to lack momentum, ultimately failing to break out of the sideways pattern. However, the difference between highs and lows was slightly larger than in previous days. While it had been fluctuating between 0.05 and 0.10, yesterday's fluctuations were between 0.30 and 0.40. Class C bonds fluctuated around $43. Since September 2, this situation has not changed. Yesterday, there was also news of a ceasefire agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union regarding Manchuria and Mongolia. The market's reaction to this move was uncertain. Trading by various interests remained light. Generally speaking, Class C bonds were firmer and Class E bonds were weaker. Market sentiment remained stable. At the end of the day, prices were mixed, with a difference of only 0.05 to 0.20. The total turnover was around $300,000. Next Monday is a holiday, and the market will be closed for one day.

<p>Furthermore, the Public Brokers Association reported that the prices of various stocks soared yesterday, and the public was eager to obtain them. Each transaction saw higher prices, and a vigorous atmosphere permeated the market. Speculation in steel stocks became active again, with a fierce upward trend reaching $8.20. However, other industrial stocks were generally stable and firm. Rubber stocks with a high degree of liquidity were widely sought after, and no one was willing to let go, resulting in several stocks showing a continuous upward trend. Although, based on any standard, the intrinsic value of rubber stocks was still significantly suppressed, the market's current trajectory may be interrupted at any time, and it is expected that those who profit can take advantage of the situation to exit. Preferred shares of the power company were difficult to obtain, and there were buyers at a price of $123 at closing.</p>
<p>A London telegram from the 15th reports that the listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks remained low, with more declines than increases.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Mills Tend to Reduce Work, Cotton Yarn Rises and Falls Sharply, Double Horse Once Opened at $860, Ten Count "De Li" Rose by $55</h3>
<p>The yarn market is increasingly showing a trend of rapid rise and fall, with the situation being exceptionally volatile. The market is filled with rumors, with most people believing that the price of raw cotton is high, inventories are dwindling, foreign prices are becoming more expensive, and mills with insufficient cotton are deeply concerned about the possibility of reducing work, which will weaken future production. The two British companies have already implemented a three-day shift system. As a result, buyers rushed in, causing the price of 20-count Double Horse to reach a new record of $860. In an instant, as those who profited sold off, the price quickly fell by $30. The price of warehouse receipts fluctuated, with the peak reaching $785 and falling back slightly to $755. This situation is startling and frightening. Hong Kong has a strong demand for 10-count coarse yarn, so the price of coarse yarn is rising even more. The price of 10-count "De Li" soared by a huge $55.</p>
<p>The morning opening price of existing yarn was up because the Indian cotton telegram showed a rise of more than ten rupees, while American cotton was flat. Market sentiment was extremely hot. The opening price of Xie Ma jumped by $57, but the spot price was slower, rising by $20 to $30. After a while, due to the sharp rise in recent days, those who profited came to sell, and the price fell back by $20 to $30. The closing price was flat. According to statistics, 960 bales were traded in half a day, compared to 300 bales traded on the previous day. The Shenxin No. 2 Factory announced the confirmed opening of 500 bales of 20-count "Tian Nu" today, priced at $800, with a deposit of $100 per bale. The market prices were: 20-count Double Horse rose by $16, Double Globe rose by $26, Tian Nu rose by $28, Xing Shi jumped by $70, Mu Yang rose by $36, 10-count Double Globe rose by $25, and "De Li" rose by $55.

<p>Hong Kong　300　Counterparts　515</p>
<p>Inland　95　Ningbo　50</p>
<p>Fuzhou　20　Total　960</p>
<h3>Tong Cotton Demanding a Price of $160</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading has been developing continuously, and various mills are eagerly searching for supplies. The available goods on the market are being sold out day by day. Overseas quotations are extremely high. Although the momentum of American cotton was flat and weak today, Indian cotton prices have risen sharply because of reduced inventories and weak arrivals from the mainland. The price of white cotton for delivery in April and May jumped by seventeen rupees. The unofficial telegram continued to show a rise of ten rupees. As a result, market sentiment was stronger, and selling prices advanced step by step. The price of Tong cotton rose again by $7. The raw material for Indian cotton 30-count yarn has reached $197 to $200. High-quality Tongzhou cotton is demanding a price of $160. According to market news, it is rumored that foreign factories are considering reducing work due to the difficulty in finding raw materials. The source from northern Jiangsu is estimated to be 500 to 600 bales of Tong cotton, and 850 bales from Beisha. 190 bales were exported to Hong Kong. The situation of spot cotton is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Yesterday's price of American-type Pengpu cotton was $180, which was mistakenly recorded as white cotton. This is corrected.</p>
<p>Another news item reports that the trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is tight because the inventory in Shanghai is dwindling, so the selling price is unusually tight. Counterparts are unwilling to sell. Some factories, seeing this situation, have already started ordering new cotton from foreign firms. However, the ship schedules are very far away, all in September and October. In recent days, tens of thousands of bales have been sold. Most of the traders are Japanese manufacturers. It is generally expected that American cotton trading will become prosperous and the Indian market price will continue to soar.</p>
<p>The Market Price of Foreign Cotton: The New York cotton market was very active in the early morning due to buying pressure, and the opening price rose sharply by 6 or 7 pounds. Subsequently, the market fell due to public selling and strong buying in the South. As a result, the closing price fell by 5 or 6 pounds compared to yesterday. The Indian cotton market has seen soaring prices due to difficult imports and low inventories in the producing areas. Yesterday, the combined forecast jumped by 18 rupees. The Egyptian cotton market was quieter, with a slight increase of 7 or 8 pounds. Liverpool rose by more than 20 pounds.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Loosen</h3>
<p>The flour market is slightly looser because it is the weekend. There has been no special progress in trading by local merchants. Since the recent dumping of products from Japanese factories on the market, some merchants are happy to buy them, so the factory flour has been quite impacted. Yesterday's return of goods for both hoarding and actual sales was flat, and the price has loosened slightly by a few cents, with a price opening of $7.225 to $7.23. The factory price is still $7.20 cash, temporarily unchanged. The future market will depend on the actual sales. On the 17th, 16,200 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat continues to be oversupplied. Arrivals from various regions have been continuous in recent days. The factories' appetite is still good, but the merchants' and hoarders' destocking has gradually slowed down. At present, sellers of high-quality goods are still trying to hold on, but medium-quality wheat has already loosened. Only 6,000 bags of wheat from Suchang Zhenyang, Wuhu, etc., jointly run by Fuxin and Fufeng factories, were traded in the market at a price of $10.05 to $9.55. High-quality wheat hoarders are watching and hesitating, and there is little trading, so the market is difficult to boost.</p>
<h3>Early and Late Rice Continue to Fall, Glutinous Rice Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no arrivals from He Xia, but 3,000 to 4,000 bags of new goods from Jiashan, Jiaxing, Kunshan, and Suzhou arrived by wagon. The overall market from the early morning still had some residual momentum from yesterday, and market sentiment continued to be good. The prices of various goods were again trying to be raised. Later, due to the loosening of sales, the supply exceeded demand, and the situation became weak. The prices of various goods gradually fell back. As a result, both early and late rice fell by $0.50 to $1.50. For example, special grade Jing was $43, high grade was $41 to $42, settled at $40, Suzhou-Tong-Kun Jing was priced at $11 to $40, He Xia early and late rice was $35, settled at $33, original package was $38 to $37.50. New Suzhou-Kun Yang sharp rice opened at $29.23, later falling to $28.70 to $28.50. Feng Jing Ling Bai sharp rice, as a fresh product, was priced at $29.50. New Jiaxing-Jiashan Yang sharp rice was $29 to $28.23, Tuan sharp rice was $29 to $28.50. Old goods of Wuhu sharp rice were not as popular as new goods, so they were priced at only $27, new sharp rice opened at $28, later to $27.50, settled at $26 to $27. New Jiangbei sharp rice was $28 to $27.50, Bian Yuan was $37 to $38, Ocean glutinous rice was high at $38.50 to $38. It is estimated that only about 5,000 bags were traded in the city.</p>
<p>Another news item reports that yesterday morning, merchants took advantage of the rising wind of the previous morning and the increased costs due to the release of rice that had been blocked, so sellers raised prices by $0.50 to $1.00 at one point. However, buyers hesitated due to the high prices, and merchants also planned to seize the opportunity to sell quickly. As a result, the market stopped rising and then weakened again. The market was very weak later, and the price decreased slightly by about $1, which was about $0.50 less than the previous market. High-quality Jiangbei late rice was $28, high-quality Wuhu late rice was $28.50, and medium-grade settled at $27 to $25.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Hoarders Continue to Release, Foreign Sugar Remains Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign sugar market continued to be weak due to hoarders continuing to release their stocks. The association's clearing price for spot No. 24 crude white sugar in the local warehouse fell to $57.30, and the minimum price in foreign warehouses was $56.50. The market was slightly better at $77, the transit price was $45, Taikoo refined white sugar was flat at the beginning and then weakened, falling from $62 to $6.80, and then to $61.20. The rest of the CW mark and other marks were retreated according to prices. H mark red sugar was $45.20 spot and $29 transit, down slightly by $1. Ben Mian Bai Zhen Ji No. 1 was $57, No. 2 was $56.50, No. 3 was $56, and No. 4 was $55.50. Ben No. 1 crystal sugar was $66.50, Jingming crystal sugar was $68. The trend of domestic sugar remained firm, with no transactions. However, 3,000 bags of sugar were shipped to Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises Frequently</h3>
<p>The port sales of soybean oil have not continued due to exchange rates. (Peanut oil has not yet opened). Driven by the environment, the scalper-style hoarders are very active, causing the market to continue to advance to new highs. Yesterday, the market rose again by $1 to $2, and Kobe oil resurfaced to the $60 mark (opening at $60.80). The record high of the 22nd of last month ($61) is bound to be broken. Total market turnover was 30 barrels of Dalian oil, 120 barrels and 50 cans of Kobe oil, 10 barrels and 165 cans of Tianjin oil, 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, and 120 pieces of Qingqi oil. The market prices are detailed in the market price column. As for export oil, 690 pieces of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>700 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha on the 16th, and 2,850 bags were shipped to Hong Kong on the 17th. 650 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Hong Kong on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods Repeatedly Create High Prices</h3>
<p>Eastern piece goods rose sharply yesterday, with the cash discount rate decreasing, and merchants' intention to trade became more active. The rising momentum was still strong, and new high prices emerged one after another. The spot price of "Long Tou" fine cloth was $12.60 per piece, and the futures price for next month was $23.75. The price of "La Ba" fine cloth for this month was $11, and for next month was $22. The current market price of "Yang He" fine cloth also required $21.50. Merchants have ordered more than 700 pieces of fine cloth. Dyeing factories in this street and Tianjin merchants purchased 500 to 600 pieces of spot fine cloth and fine twill. The market generally lacked supply. The price of colored "Si Jun Zi" broadcloth was $0.72 per yard for delivery next month, creating a new record never seen before.</p>
<p>Regarding exports, 520 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Ningbo on the 16th, 370 pieces to Hong Kong on the 17th, and 160 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Overcoating Cloth: Low-End Goods are in Short Supply</h3>
<p>The market for overcoating cloth has been unusually expensive recently, as the source of supply is lacking, and the exchange rate for all bills of exchange is around 4 pence, resulting in high costs. The selling price of ordinary overcoating cloth, which used to sell for $5 to $6 per yard, has now risen to $10 per yard. There is a severe shortage of these thick goods in both local and foreign warehouses, and the market is particularly tight. Looking at future arrivals, (1) most of the counterparts are telegraphing for slow loading, (2) the number of ships from Europe is limited, and (3) the forced use of "Huaxing" notes for tax payment has further increased the cost, resulting in strong market sentiment.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Yarn Trading is Not Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market saw New York's recent price rise by 0.125 and the forward price by 0.13, spot raw silk rose by 0.03, Yokohama rose by $10, and the forward price rose by $75. However, foreign firms in Shanghai were not actively purchasing, as the recent rise in silk prices in Japan and the United States has been too drastic and erratic. American sales of Reeled Silk No. 6 opened at $1,900, a drop of $150 compared to the high price. White Factory B word traders held the price at $4,300. It is said that Shao Chengwen only sold 45 piculs of Reeled Silk No. 4 yesterday.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: New Hunan Lotus Seeds Initially Rise by More Than $10</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of new Hunan lotus seeds, the lowest price of lotus seeds from this lake once broke the $100 mark, a drop of more than one-third compared to the initial price. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining a source and the scarcity of arrivals, the price turned around. Yesterday, it opened up more than $10 to $110, and the market is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Top Grade Lily Buds</h3>
<p>Lily buds have seen a turnaround recently, and the top grade of good goods has been firm and tight. Top grade has reached a high price of $50, and has now reopened to $52. However, the price of middle and low grade goods has only risen by $2 to $3.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Counterparts and Hoarders Search for Purchases, Prices Rise Frequently</h3>
<p>Hardware prices have been rising continuously, as European goods cannot be shipped, and only American goods can monopolize the hardware market in Shanghai. Unfortunately, there are few ships, freight rates have risen, and war risk insurance has increased. The factories have repeatedly decided to raise prices, and counterparts cannot order goods. In the future, the arrival of hardware will be scarce. Counterparts and outsiders are competing to purchase, and hoarders are absorbing and hoarding for speculation, causing the market prices of various goods to skyrocket. Yesterday, the price of 24-gauge large Malacca tinplate opened at $1,000 per box, the price of 26-gauge opened at $500, the price of 100-pound genuine Double Speed tinplate opened at $240, the price of 90-pound opened at $220, the price of Company Steel opened at $170, the price of pig lead opened at $750, the price of blue lead opened at $120, the price of local nails opened at $60, the price of black iron billets opened at $1,000, the price of new lead wire opened at $90, and the price of white lead wire opened at $50, all of which have soared by 10 to 20 percent compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3>Ribbed Steel Bars - Selling Prices Also High</h3>
<p>The largest outlet for ribbed steel bars is the construction industry in this street, and there is a lack of outlets for merchants. Tianjin is flooded due to floods, so there is no intention to purchase. Qingdao and Yantai merchants have also not started purchasing due to ship schedules and blockades. Although merchants in southern China have made some purchases, the number is very small. Therefore, the only reliance for these goods is the corner of Shanghai. The opening price is only seen to rise day by day. At present, the market price is $760 per ton for 3/8 inch to 4/8 inch and $710 per ton for 5/8 inch to 1 inch. Other market prices are attached below (unit: yuan)</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: High Quality Galangal Soars Again</h3>
<p>Galangal is divided into three types: large, medium, and small. At present, the producing area is controlled by a certain party, and it is necessary to settle the purchase of foreign exchange before allowing export. Moreover, ship fares and other expenses are very expensive, so the Shanghai pharmaceutical companies have to raise prices again. The current market price is more than $14 to $15 higher than the previous market price. Moreover, Hankou merchants are also moving, so the future market is expected to continue to rise. It is estimated that there are only 300 to 400 pieces in stock in the market.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports - European Goods Recently Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, goods arriving in Shanghai include 3,361 pieces and 200 pieces of Italian Lianlai Qing, 250 boxes of woolen cloth, and 30 pieces of pigments. However, 35 pieces of rayon were transferred to Tianjin. The day before yesterday (the 13th), 5,079 bags of foreign rice were transported from Hong Kong, and 370 bags of soybeans were transported from Beisha.

<h3>General Medhurst Returns to Shanghai, Closely Watching the Situation, Conferring with Consul General Gauss for Careful Response; Negotiations in Western Shanghai Reportedly Nearing Conclusion</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, the Japanese took the opportunity to exert pressure on the two concessions. On the 6th, they demanded that Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in China. On the 8th, they supported the puppet police and began to encroach on the extraterritorial roads. On the 13th, they demanded that the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai change their defense zones. On the 6th, a Japanese naval spokesman told a Western newspaper reporter that "necessary steps will be taken according to the decision," which has been staged one by one. As a result, the situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly serious. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council has conducted negotiations with the Japanese on the extraterritorial roads, the Japanese actions are still in full swing. Rear Admiral Medhurst, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, to whom the U.S. government has granted broad powers regarding Far Eastern issues, had just returned to Qingdao from Shanghai when he was ordered to quickly take his private yacht, the Isabel, to Shanghai at 11:30 the previous morning to contact various parties and respond to the serious situation. It is expected that there will be major developments within a day or two. The detailed situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Medhurst's Actions Are Highly Significant</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson is far away in Chongqing and does not intend to come to Shanghai. Regarding Far Eastern issues and Shanghai issues, the U.S. government and Ambassador Johnson have granted broad powers to Rear Admiral Medhurst, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet stationed in Qingdao, and Consul General Gauss stationed in Shanghai, instructing them to closely monitor the development of the situation. Any event that involves U.S. interests in Shanghai or is sufficient to weaken U.S. interests in the Far East will be handled carefully by the two gentlemen in accordance with the government's consistent foreign policy, maintaining contact with British and French officials stationed in Shanghai. It is reported that Rear Admiral Medhurst visited Mr. Gauss the afternoon of the day before yesterday after arriving in Shanghai to listen to various information and exchange opinions. A counterproposal will be put forward regarding the Japanese request to change the defense zone for reference by the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai. The authorities of various countries stationed in Shanghai also look to the United States for guidance in dealing with the various difficult issues at hand. Therefore, Medhurst's actions are highly significant.</p>
<p>Japanese Coveting British Military District</p>
<p>After Commander Shishido of the Japanese Marine Corps convened a meeting of the commanders of the British, American, and other countries' defense forces to request adjustments to the troop defense zones, it was widely rumored in the Zhabei area that the Japanese would follow the example of the area from North Jiangxi Road to North Sichuan Road, block the area west of North Jiangxi Road to North Xizang Road, and place it under Japanese control. Residents in the area would be issued permits by the Japanese within a time limit, and Japanese troops would be stationed at the Zilaishui Bridge, Tianhou Palace Bridge, Shanxi Road Bridge, Fujian Road Bridge, Old Garbage Bridge, and New Garbage Bridge to check permits and epidemic prevention certificates, etc. Whether this claim is true regarding the British garrison in Zhabei is temporarily impossible to confirm, but the rumors of the Japanese attempt to take over the British defense zone seem not without cause.</p>
<p>American Radio Station Broadcasts Absurd News</p>
<p>The *Continental Daily News* reported that when the American Golden Gate Broadcasting Station broadcast news last night (the 15th), it claimed that the Shanghai British military authorities had received an order to withdraw from the British military defense zone in western Shanghai within a month, etc. Those in this port who listened to this broadcast news were greatly shocked. However, it has been proven that this statement is completely absurd. Upon further inquiry, both British and Japanese authorities categorically denied it. The Japanese naval spokesman also agreed with the British embassy spokesman's statement that "this statement is completely untrue." It should be noted that the Golden Gate Broadcasting Station has broadcast inaccurate news for the third time in less than two weeks. The previous two times, it reported that the U.S. authorities, in view of the "emergency" situation caused by the Japanese demands on the Shanghai Public Concession, had dispatched the U.S. 6th Marine Regiment to Shanghai, and that the French army had broken through the German Siegfried Line on the second day of fighting on the Western Front.</p>
<p>Phillips Visited Chuanchiawong</p>
<p>Regarding the negotiations on the extraterritorial roads, the reporter heard the day before yesterday that Phillips, Chairman and Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, would meet with Japanese representatives on that day to continue negotiations. This was confirmed yesterday morning. That afternoon, Mr. Phillips did meet with Japanese representatives to exchange views on general issues in a private capacity, but no concrete results were obtained. Yesterday, the Japanese newspapers reported that Mr. Phillips visited the puppet mayor Chuanchiawong in the downtown area at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, and had a 50-minute talk on the extraterritorial road issue in western Shanghai, which had achieved a "satisfactory solution." However, the spokesman of the Shanghai Municipal Council is not prepared to comment on this.</p>
<p>The *China Press* reported that according to the Japanese *Shanghai Continental Daily News*, Mr. Phillips, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, met with "Mayor Chuan Chia-an" at the "Municipal Government" office in the downtown area at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 15th). As a result, the extraterritorial road issue is expected to be satisfactorily resolved. Today (the 16th), it was heard that Mr. Phillips is not prepared to make any comments on this.</p>
<p>The Western Shanghai Robbery Is Reported to Have a Background</p>
<p>At about 7 p.m. the day before yesterday, three Chinese constables of the Jing'an Temple station were robbed of three pistols while patrolling near the Wujiaochang in Caojiadu. There are many rumors that the constables were disarmed. According to nearby residents, this happened at 7:10 p.m. that evening, when three Chinese constables were patrolling on Jessfield Road, sixteen people suddenly rushed out at the corner of Jessfield Road and Connaught Road, surrounding the three. The three fought bravely, but due to the disparity in numbers, the pistols they carried were robbed. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled into the gambling den area on the side of the road and disappeared. The police station, upon receiving the report, dispatched two armored vehicles to search the area, but found nothing. This incident occurred in the eventful extraterritorial road construction, and the thugs openly formed gangs and carried weapons. Moreover, the weapons they carried were Mauser rifles and box cannons. All parties believe that this act must have a background.</p>
<p>The Police Station Began Preparations Yesterday</p>
<p>The Lin Mansion at No. 448 Haig Road (west of Difeng Road) has been actively engaged in preparations since it was occupied by Japanese military police and puppet police on the 13th. On the one hand, the existing wire mesh along the road was completely dismantled, and on the other hand, workers were hired to repair the houses. The work has been very busy in recent days. Yesterday, sandbags were piled up in front of the main gate and side gate to build fortifications. Some of the puppet police guarding the gate placed their guns on the sandbags in a radiating manner, and the situation appeared somewhat serious. The police station also dispatched armored vehicles and bicycle teams from yesterday onwards to patrol from time to time, and extra detectives were assigned to guard the entrances and exits of various roads in case of emergencies.</p>
<p>The Japanese Continue to Build Fortifications</p>
<p>No. 11 Jessfield Road has been occupied by the Japanese puppets for a week now. In recent days, defensive works have continued to be built. Yesterday, circular holes were dug along the ground on the walls on both sides of the gate, leading to the sand fortresses built outside, and wire mesh was added to the sides of the sand fortresses to increase defensive strength. Six puppet police officers are still guarding the gate. Very few Japanese puppets enter or leave. The number of people stationed inside seemed to have decreased yesterday.</p>
<p>Detectives Search Passing Pedestrians</p>
<p>The Qiu Pu at No. 15 Jessfield Road and the area around Kangjia Bridge and Jinjia Lane are still guarded by puppet police posts, and the situation is the same as in the past. The fortresses at the gate of the Japanese military police Western District Command and the puppet police branch on Malu Bridge are being actively built by the Japanese military police, who are transporting bricks and stones. As for Caojiadu, after the pistols carried by the constables at the post were robbed by thugs the day before yesterday, the police station dispatched an armored vehicle to patrol the area yesterday. Detectives were also increased in the Robison Road area, and pedestrians were searched, and the situation became tense again.</p>
<h3>New Stamps Worth Ten Yuan Specifically for Parcel Post, Already Delivered to Shanghai Post Office for Distribution</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has received a new type of stamp worth ten yuan with the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen from the Directorate General of Posts. The above stamps are printed by the Hong Kong China Bookstore, which is briefly called the Hong Kong version. It is known that the highest face value of the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen stamps has always been five yuan. Currently, due to the annual increase in postage for parcel delivery, the post office has printed them to meet the needs of senders. In addition, the Hong Kong version of Dr. Sun Yat-sen stamps with a face value of two fen has been sold in the mainland, and they are also printed in Hong Kong. However, the Shanghai Post Office has not yet sold them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Declares Blockade of Wenzhou Bay, Effective 7 p.m. Today, Notification Given to Third Countries</h3>
<p>Transportation between Shanghai and Wenzhou has recently been often inconvenient due to the actions of the Japanese Navy. It was learned yesterday that the Japanese side recently informed diplomatic officials and customs officials of third countries through the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai that, according to the decision of the Commander of the Fleet in China, Wenzhou Bay will be blocked effective 7 p.m. today (the 17th), and obstacles will be placed. The blocked areas are: (1) the waterway on the west side of Weiao Mountain; (2) the vicinity of the 270-degree line of the Ni Reef datum point; (3) the vicinity of the connecting line between Xiaowuxing Island and the northeastern end of Hutou Island, etc.</p>
<h3>Tribute Rice Continues to Be Sold at Low Prices, Efforts to Maintain Order; Yesterday, Common People Scrambled to Buy Rice, One Elderly Woman Trampled to Death</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the tribute rice sale. Although the sale time was stipulated to start at 8 a.m., the common people who bought rice arrived as early as 5 a.m. yesterday morning, carrying baskets and burdens, waiting at the entrances of various sales locations. After 8 a.m., the average number of people in each district was more than two or three thousand. It is estimated that (District 1) 100 bags of rice were sold out at 2 p.m.; (District 2) the first batch of 100 bags was sold out at noon, and another 100 bags were issued in the afternoon, which were also sold out at about 2 p.m., and then another 100 bags were issued, which had not been sold out by 4 p.m., and the civilians refused to disperse, and the matter was not completed until 7 p.m.; (District 2) 100 bags were sold out at noon, and sales were announced to be suspended in the afternoon due to poor order; (District 4) sales were also suspended in the afternoon due to crowding and tragedy; (District 5) 100 bags were sold out at noon, and the order was the best there.</p>
<p>Tragedy Occurs in District 4 Rice Sales</p>
<p>The Shandong Guild Hall at No. 249 Ximen Road, French Concession, was managed by the Shanghai Rice Industry Association and various groups as the fourth sales location, which held the sales at 8 a.m. yesterday. However, at this time of serious rice shortage, before the time arrived, five or six thousand people had gathered, with old and young, mixed knowledge, scrambling to be first and disobeying order, and unfortunately a tragedy occurred as a result.</p>
<p>Too Many People Rush In</p>
<p>Although the sales were stipulated to start at 8 a.m., some people went to wait before dawn. Before 8 a.m., the number of people gathered more and more. At that time, there were only three Indian constables, two Chinese police chiefs, and two on-duty Chinese constables, who were unable to maintain order. Therefore, those at the front had crowded to the door. At the same time, students from the Qilu School attached to the Shandong Guild Hall were going to school, and the public took the opportunity to rush in, about three hundred people. The police quickly closed the iron gate, but the number of people outside the gate was large, and the large iron gate on the front of the Shandong Guild Hall suddenly opened, causing those standing at the front to be pushed to the ground, crying for help, and the order was thrown into chaos.</p>
<p>Pushed Higher and Higher</p>
<p>Moreover, there were many people, pushing higher and higher, and the cries shook the sky. Although the few police officers and sales personnel present tried their best to rescue them, they were of no avail. The police station was notified and sent a large number of detectives to break the siege. However, the ribs of an elderly woman in her sixties at the bottom were broken, and she was barely breathing. She was sent to the hospital and died of her injuries shortly after. There were also two brothers from Hangzhou who were seriously injured in the chest, one Tong Jinsheng, 28 years old, and one Tong Asan, 26 years old, who lived at No. 778 Kangdi Road, Malang Road, and a local woman, Lu Tang, 36 years old, who lived at No. 67 Changyuan Lane, Yangjia Lane, Pushi Road, who injured her chest and waist.</p>
<p>Sold Out in Less Than Three Hours</p>
<p>In addition, there were countless minor injuries, head injuries, loss of money, and damaged clothes. Mr. Yu Qiaqing received the news, drove to the scene to inquire and express his condolences, and sighed deeply. The discounted rice was sold out in less than three hours, and a notice was posted at the gate stating that the discounted rice had been sold out and would be sold again at 8 a.m. tomorrow. However, those who had not purchased it gathered at the gate and did not disperse until late. A small number of those who had purchased rice tickets but had not yet received the rice were allowed to continue to collect the rice today after being signed and certified by the sales staff.</p>
<p>Other Districts Also Had Injuries Yesterday. Although there were detectives to assist in maintaining order at various sales locations yesterday, the number of people was too crowded and they jostled each other, resulting in the tragedy in District 4 at the Shandong Guild Hall. In District 1 on Beihainan Road, the straw shed that had been built was pushed over by the crowd yesterday morning, and the wooden fences in front of the door were also broken. Although the location of the straw shed on Carter Road was wider, only the wooden fences were broken. In the third district, the Jade Buddha Temple, a civilian was also squeezed and injured yesterday morning. In the second district, at the intersection of Carter Road, someone was injured at about 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing Was Very Concerned</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing said, "This sale is because the quality of the rice is quite good, and the selling price is 20 yuan per picul, so the general public is scrambling to buy it. It was originally set to have five sales locations in the two concessions, with a limit of 100 bags per location per day. However, the current situation is obviously absolutely insufficient, so it has been decided not to add restrictions, and to sell all 8,000 bags of discounted rice. Regarding the sales situation yesterday, the purchasers were too crowded. In order to avoid similar incidents from happening in the future, each sales location will block the entrances and exits so that purchasers can enter and exit according to the decision, so as to avoid rushing and squeezing. As for the Jade Buddha Temple and other sales locations, it was discovered yesterday that many refugees went to buy rice. These refugees have rations supplied in the shelters, and the rising rice prices have not affected them at all. The purpose of buying rice seems to be to make a profit. If they are allowed to buy discounted rice, the purpose of running the discounted sale will be lost, so they have been stopped. After this, we will continue to order tribute rice and run the discounted sale. Currently, all parties are still in progress.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Fell by One Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the total number of rice registered by cargo owners with the Rice Market Management Committee was 6,429 bags. The market transactions were still light. Also, because yesterday was the day when the sale of tribute rice started, the market was affected by it, and the price of rice fell by one yuan. The highest price of indica rice was 28 yuan per picul. Because there were no transactions for japonica rice, the price did not change. According to the management committee member, tomorrow is the "September 18th" anniversary, and the market should be closed as usual, but in view of the Shanghai rice market situation, which is not stable, the market will not be closed tomorrow either. After the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, the market has also decided to open as usual on Sundays.</p>

<h3>Newsprint Supply Is Assured; Large Shipments from Norway Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the German-Polish war, the prices of foreign goods soared. The price of newsprint, in particular, soared even faster. Normally, each ream was sold for only six or seven yuan, but now it has reached a selling price of more than thirty yuan, which has greatly affected newspapers, bookstores, and all printing businesses. It is learned that a large batch of newsprint previously ordered from Europe by Shanghai merchants has now arrived in Shanghai one after another, and prices may be lowered. It is learned that the Norwegian merchant ship Talleyrand, loaded with a large batch of newsprint, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. Helmspey, also fully loaded with newsprint, is currently en route and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 20th. It is also heard that a German ship was also carrying a large amount of newsprint to Shanghai when the German-Polish war broke out, but was subsequently seized near Singapore.</p>
<h3>Two Detained Foreign Journalists Returned to Shanghai from Ningbo Because They Did Not Have Passports and Were Detained in Jian</h3>
<p>The *China Press* reported that Messrs. Belden, former reporter for the Associated Press, and Farmo, formerly employed by the *Continental Daily News*, went to Chongqing to report on the war. They were detained by the Chinese authorities in Jian for not having passports, and sent back to Shanghai. They arrived in port from Ningbo this morning (the 16th).</p>

<h3>German Merchants Still Agree to Deliver Goods According to Orders from Chinese Customers; Blindly Raising Prices May Lead to Regret; Speculators and Hoarders Should Be Aware</h3>
<p>After the war, Shanghai's interior benefited from a large influx of funds, resulting in a gradual increase in funds. However, due to the lack of proper channels for utilization, the rise of speculative businesses has been created, such as foreign exchange arbitrage, foreign currency gold securities trading, and the hoarding of various commodities, which has caused the prices in the concessions to soar and the abnormal development of industry. This development is not only detrimental to the stability of Shanghai's financial market, but also runs counter to the government's wartime financial policies. Since the outbreak of the European War, the prices of all goods from Britain, Germany, and France have gradually soared, with some rising more than tenfold. The most significant increases have been in pigments, foreign needles, foreign wool, hardware, Western medicine, and coal. Among the pigments, black carbon black has risen from 90 yuan per dan to more than 1,000 yuan. Foreign needles, such as Lihe needles, have risen from 60 yuan per 10,000 to 160 yuan. Newsprint has risen from 7 yuan per ream to 26 yuan. The main reason is that in this chaotic situation, buyers fear that the source of goods will become less and less, while sellers expect huge profits.</p>
<p>The general public, with no knowledge, in view of the wealth that was made during the last European War, regardless of Shanghai's inventory and future actual sales, desperately engaged in hoarding. Various foreign firms, factories, and companies took the opportunity to raise prices, creating this abnormal phenomenon. However, the livelihood of the general public has been greatly affected. It should be known that China is now in a period of resistance against Japan, which is different from China during the last European War. Moreover, the last European War lasted for several years, which was indeed due to the depletion of inventory. The above-mentioned phenomenon occurred within three to five days of the outbreak of this European War. Currently, the inventory of British, German, and French goods in China is still sufficient, and the source has not been completely cut off. For example, two German cargo ships carrying pigments and foreign needles from Germany to China were blocked in Japan, but they have now been unloaded and reloaded onto Japanese ships and will arrive in Shanghai soon. At the same time, German goods have been loaded onto neutral country ships and are sailing to China. It is heard that the Danish ship King, loaded with foreign paper, hardware, etc., will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of this month. Therefore, European goods will still be able to come to China. The various German firms in Shanghai still agree to deliver goods according to orders from Chinese merchants and will not cancel orders due to the European War. Therefore, it is hoped that speculators and hoarders of foreign goods who seek to profit will have a considerable awareness to avoid regrets in the future. At the same time, the prices in Shanghai will not rise abnormally again, and the livelihood of the people can be slightly stabilized.</p>
<h3>German Ships Plan to Try Sailing to Eastern Zhejiang; Hana Returns Safely to Shanghai; Shanghai-Wenzhou Freight Gradually Smooths</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, there has been concern about whether the German merchant ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line can continue to sail. The companies themselves have also been hesitant to make a decision. After careful consideration by the shipping department of Lihe Company, it was believed that sailing within three nautical miles of neutral territorial waters would not be affected. Therefore, the Moufu ship decided to sail from Zhenhai to Shanghai on the 14th and arrived safely in port on the 15th.</p>
<p>Hana Returns to Shanghai Safely</p>
<p>It is learned that the Hana ship of the German Far East Company also returned to Shanghai the night before last and arrived at Jinliyuan Wharf yesterday morning. According to the ship's crew, the situation along the way was very safe. The above two ships are still planning to sail as usual, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. It is heard that the Haifu ship will also sail to Shanghai on a scheduled date after loading is completed.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Wenzhou Freight Gradually Smooths</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Wenzhou route has been blocked for a long time, and all freight has been suspended. After the British Xin Anli ship successfully returned to Shanghai after a trial voyage a few days ago, the British Xinxiangtai, represented by Taichangxiang, and the Shen'ai and Shenfu ships of Yilong Foreign Company have successively continued to sail to Wenzhou and have arrived in Wenzhou to load and unload goods. Also, the Shenyou ship of Yilong Foreign Company is scheduled to set sail to Wenzhou today. The Yongtai Marler ship of the British Far East Shipping Company is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou on September 19. The Shenyou ship of the British Yilong Company arrived in Shanghai from Yantai the day before yesterday and is also scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning. However, all ships are currently only loading cargo and not carrying passengers. Therefore, Shanghai-Wenzhou freight has gradually become smooth.</p>
<p>Gaodeng Sails to Haimen Jinchang Port</p>
<p>According to the reporter of Daguan News Agency's inquiries to the shipping industry, navigation to Haimen in eastern Zhejiang has been cut off for nearly half a year since the Chinese military authorities implemented a blockade. It is learned that the Gaodeng ship of the German Lulin Company is now planning to try sailing to Jinchang Port in Haimen, also limited to loading cargo. However, the date of departure has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Two Concessions Jointly on Alert This Morning; Chinese and Western Detectives Deployed to Inspect Pedestrians; Extra Precautions Taken in Extraterritorial Sections of Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions, in view of tomorrow being the "September 18th" anniversary, have decided to start joint preparations this morning. Extra precautions are being taken in the western Shanghai area. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Preparations Begin This Morning</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the eighth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, which is about to arrive in the blink of an eye. In order to prevent any untoward incidents, the police authorities of the two concessions have banned all gatherings since the 13th and will begin special preparations today. Patrol teams composed of Chinese, Western, Russian, Vietnamese, and Indian detectives will conduct inspections of pedestrians and vehicles in their respective districts, and armored vehicles will patrol the various roads. However, no obstacles have been placed on the various roads.</p>
<p>Western Shanghai Takes More Stringent Precautions</p>
<p>The Wujiaochang area in western Shanghai had an incident a few days ago in which thugs robbed three pistols from constables of the Public Concession. Therefore, the authorities are paying special attention to this matter. Starting yesterday, the Jing'an Temple, Gordon Road, and Pudu Road police stations dispatched additional detectives to step up precautions in the western Shanghai area. In addition to setting up double posts, vehicle patrol teams and patrol teams are also stepping up patrols, paying attention to Jing'an Temple Road, Jessfield Road, Yu Garden Road, Route Tenant de la Tour, Connaught Road, Anhua Temple Road, Singapore Road, and other roads. The French Concession is also taking extra precautions in the Xujiahui area.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Administration Restricts Postal Money Orders to Jiangsu Province; Additional Water Fee Collected in Various Places; Amount of Drafts Appropriately Reduced</h3>
<p>In order to restrict postal money orders in various parts of Jiangsu Province, the Shanghai Postal Administration has increased the exchange fee. The method is to increase the water fee by one point per yuan for those who previously only charged the exchange fee and did not add the water fee, and increase the water fee from two points to three points for those who previously charged the water fee. The amount of the exchange has also been appropriately reduced to show the restriction.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Volumes of Japanese Goods in August Both Decreased Compared to July; Main Export Item Is Ancient Bottles</h3>
<p>Recently, although Shanghai's trade with Japan has not had precise statistics due to various reasons, the types of imports and exports have also changed considerably compared to before the war. According to customs information, the import and export volumes of Japanese goods in Shanghai in August both decreased compared to July. The import was 53,395 tons, of which the import of chemical industrial drugs was drastically reduced. The major import items were wood, cement, and newsprint, and soft drinks and beer even reached more than 3,000 tons. Textile machines and parts were 600 tons, of which fresh fish and salted vegetables were 700 tons, and wild tea was more than 1,400 tons. As for exports to Japan in August, it was only more than 10,000 tons, of which the main export item was ancient bottles, accounting for more than 5,000 tons, which can be said to have created a new pattern in Sino-Japanese trade. Silk cocoons were only more than 100 tons, flax was 10 tons, and wheat bean cake ranked first in exports to Japan, at more than 4,000 tons. From this recent situation of Shanghai's Sino-Japanese trade, a rough overview can be seen.</p>
<h3>Not All European Refugees Are Prohibited from Coming to Shanghai; Consensus Among All Parties; Effective After Approval</h3>
<p>The *China Press* reported that a meeting continued to be held at the Japanese Consulate yesterday (the 15th) regarding the entry of European refugees into Shanghai. The proposals put forward by the Japanese Consulate representative after studying the proposals of the Shanghai Municipal Council were considered, and a draft interim agreement was drawn up to prevent the complete prohibition of the entry of European refugees into Shanghai, which took a further step. There was indeed no conflict of opinion between the proposals of the representatives of the Japanese Consulate and the Shanghai Municipal Council. Representatives of the French authorities and the local Jewish Committee have also approved the proposals. The agreed agreement is now awaiting approval by the relevant standing authorities to see if it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Temporary Business Registration Certificates: Do Not Issue Indiscriminately; Industry Associations Themselves Shall Be Held Responsible for False Certification</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs notified the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating: Upon investigation, according to the regulations in the first section of the first clause of the "Provisional Measures for Commercial Registration in Shanghai," when applying for temporary registration, a certificate should be issued by the local trade association for the relevant industry. Additionally, according to the second clause of the same article, those issuing certificates regarding whether a commercial establishment's registration involves circumstances under Article 21 of the Commercial Registration Law should solemnly declare their willingness to bear legal responsibility. Recently, Shanghai industry associations have often failed to conduct detailed investigations of fellow businesses applying for certificates, simply issuing them without verifying that there is no misuse of other businesses' names. This not only violates regulations, but also places the associations themselves at risk of being held responsible for the crime of false certification. Therefore, it is necessary to inform all industry associations to pay close attention and not issue certificates indiscriminately. Furthermore, a report on the handling of this matter must be submitted promptly.</p>
<h3>Counselor of the French Embassy, Roux, Departs for America</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," Roux, the counselor of the French Embassy in China, due to health reasons, departed this morning (the 16th) by ship, traveling via America to return to France for recuperation.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's High Tide in the Huangpu River Caused Sewer Backflow, Receding Only at 5 PM; Continued High Tides Expected Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Due to weather conditions, the tide in the Huangpu River has experienced continuous high tides since the 11th, averaging over ten feet. Yesterday, due to stronger southeasterly winds, around 2 PM, the tide caused backflow from the sewers, leading to water accumulation on low-lying roads such as Caishi Street, Yinhua Street, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, Nanjing Road, and Route Lafayette, ranging from three to five inches to over a foot deep. The water only began to recede around 5 PM. However, the Caojiadu area remained flooded up to the ankles. According to a report from the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, this high tide will persist until the 20th. Aside from today and tomorrow (the 17th and 18th), which will be similar to yesterday, the remaining days will only see tides around ten feet, and the roads are not expected to flood.</p>
<h3>Increased International Telegram Fees at Various Telegraph Offices; Separate Rates for Soviet Telegrams; Chinese Telegrams to Hong Kong Refused</h3>
<p>The Great Northern and Eastern Extension Telegraph Companies in Shanghai have recently increased their rates for telegrams sent from Shanghai to various European countries. While they are still receiving and sending telegrams as usual, the fees have increased several times over. According to a source at the telegraph office who spoke with a reporter from Da Guang Press yesterday, telegrams to Europe now cost 8.65 yuan in national currency per word (including countries such as England, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, and Belgium). The Soviet Union is an exception to this. Telegrams to New York in the United States now cost 11.20 yuan in national currency per word (other locations in the United States are an exception). Telegrams to Hong Kong, which previously cost 0.14 yuan per word in Chinese and 0.28 yuan per word in English, are now refusing to accept Chinese, only accepting clear English text at 0.70 yuan per word.</p>
<h3>Shenzhou Hotel Searched Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shenzhou Hotel on Fuzhou Road and Zhejiang Road was searched by the Police Department at approximately 9 PM last night. The operation involved two red police armored vehicles, the White Russian volunteer corps, and over seventy detectives, who surrounded and secured the hotel, temporarily prohibiting passage. Inside the hotel, detectives from the Police Department searched individual rooms, ordering all guests to remain in their rooms and refrain from any movement. Luggage and belongings were thoroughly inspected. The operation concluded and forces withdrew around 10 PM. It is understood that nothing was found. However, to safeguard the security of the city, public places and busy areas will be under close surveillance within the next few days, and all pedestrians and vehicles will be inspected.</p>
<h3>Minimal Impact on Silk Exports After Outbreak of European War; Although Most Shipping Routes Are Obstructed, Silk Goods Can Still Be Sold to India and the Americas</h3>
<p>The French-language "Journal de Shanghai" reported on the 6th that since the outbreak of the European war, the Shanghai silk market has been somewhat disrupted, but silk prices have not fallen significantly, and the market conditions remain largely normal. Although transportation between Shanghai and Europe is mostly obstructed now, Shanghai silk can still be sold to places like India and the Americas, so there is no immediate cause for panic. Furthermore, since June, silk exports have totaled 15,583 bales, compared to 7,927 bales during the same period last year.</p>
<h3>Landlords Continue to Raise Rents on Properties in the Bustling Nanjing Road Area; Over Fifty Businesses Firmly Reject</h3>
<p>The properties located west of Shiliu Road and east of Daxin Street (i.e., Hubei Road) along the north side of Nanjing Road belong to the Yu Xing Real Estate Company. The buildings are over twenty years old and rents have been raised several times. In January of this year, another rent increase was mediated, resulting in tenants paying additional water fees, settling rent obligations in cash rather than entirely through remittances, and establishing a rent increase agreement to ensure mutual commitment and avoid further disputes. However, recently, prices for all goods in Shanghai have soared, and landlords, seeing an opportunity, are eager to increase rents, disregarding the burdens on businesses. The Yu Xing Real Estate Company has demanded that its tenants, including over fifty well-known shops such as the Zhonghua Store, Sanxing Cotton and Iron Factory, Tongchunxiang Cotton Cloth Store, Sanyou Industrial Society, Xiangya Company, Da Zhonghua Electric Company, and Hefeng Woolen Company, increase their rents by as much as 30% to 40% of the original rent. These shops, which have been tenants for over ten years, upon receiving the notice, jointly protested that the ink on the rent increase agreement was barely dry. They argued that the claim of low original rent, increased land value, and high construction material costs was insatiable and unreasonable, and they unanimously rejected the demands. Seeing their desires thwarted, the company hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against the tenants in the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering the defendants to increase their rents by 30% to 40% starting from August 1st of this year, for a period of twenty months. The tenants also hired lawyers Zhang Henghai, Zhang Yuji, Ma Zhenzong, and Lin Dewen to present their defense based on facts and legal principles, arguing that the buildings were old, the styles were outdated, and any damage was repaired by the tenants themselves. Furthermore, the increased land valuation by the Municipal Council was purely due to the Council's tax policies and could not be used as a reason for rent increases. They also cited successful previous court judgments for rent reductions following the January 28th and August 13th incidents, as well as precedents set by the Supreme Court regarding rent increases and reductions, requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims and the bearing of litigation costs. Yesterday morning, Judge Ni Zheng'ao convened the parties for a hearing in the Third Civil Court. First, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, Mr. Wang, stated the plaintiff's case. Then, he announced that nine tenants had already reached settlements outside of court and requested permission to withdraw the lawsuits against those nine tenants. Additionally, lawyers representing two other tenants reached settlements with the plaintiff in court. The lawyers representing the remaining tenants, including Tongchunxiang, then vehemently argued that, according to civil law, landlords must demonstrate an increase in land value to justify rent increases. Shanghai's commercial sector had been severely damaged by the two previous wars, and the real estate value had only decreased. Furthermore, rent had already been increased this year, and a written agreement was in place. To demand another increase just half a year later was unreasonable and unjust, and the tenants could not accept it. They requested the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims and the suspension of the case, as two other tenants had previously been involved in a lawsuit regarding the plaintiff's rent increase, and that case was currently under appeal. This case shared the same facts and should be considered after the appellate judgment was final. Judge Ni then adjourned the hearing to a later date for further review. As for the two tenants who agreed to the rent increase and reached a settlement in court, they had close ties with the landlord and did not act in unison with the others.</p>
<h3>Commercial Temporary Registration Approved for Eleven Businesses</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently approved temporary commercial registration in Shanghai for eleven businesses, including the Huamei Chemical Industrial Manufacturing Factory, Yan Yan Industrial Cooperative, Sanyu Weaving Factory, etc. Their business scope, capital amount, names and addresses of principals or partners, location, and registration notice numbers are all being published in the eighth issue of the "Commercial Monthly Report" in accordance with ministry orders.</p>
<h3>News from Tianjin Flood: Rising Prices and Impoverished People Facing Starvation and Cold</h3>
<p>The tragic situation of the Tianjin flood is truly shocking. Millions of people are homeless, and the area between Beiping and Baoding has become a large lake, inundating fourteen counties. Epidemics are rampant, with numerous cases reported. Aid is urgently needed, and delays may prove fatal. Mr. Ou Yongkang, the general manager of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, gave a statement yesterday, of which a summary is provided here. Mr. Ou stated that the flood originated from incessant rain in the first half of August.</p>
<p>The Hai River (i.e., the Bai River) saw its water level rise to the top of the dikes on August 16th, and they soon breached. The authorities of the Tianjin concessions quickly constructed temporary earthen embankments around the city to defend against the flood. These new embankments were made of sandbags filled with soil, four feet high and six feet wide, using a total of two million bags. However, these embankments were only effective for a short time. On the afternoon of August 20th, they were breached, with the floodwaters first entering the British concession, then the Japanese concession, and finally the French concession at 8 PM. All the lights went out, and residents could only struggle in the darkness. By morning, the bustling streets had turned into waterways, with water depths reaching fifteen feet. Transportation relied entirely on small boats, with some using wooden basins or window planks. Cars were nowhere to be seen. The British concession has now been able to restore electricity, but the French concession has not yet recovered. The disaster victims in Tianjin are living on the water, suffering extreme hardship. Floating corpses are seen daily, and many suffer from leg ulcers. Hospitals have no space to accommodate them. The railways are shut down, making it impossible to evacuate the victims. Prices have skyrocketed, with rice costing 50 yuan per bag and flour costing 20 yuan per sack. The wealthy can only afford steamed buns, porridge, and salted vegetables, while the poor cannot even think about food. The floodwaters show no signs of receding. According to the Hai River Engineering Association, it may not recede for two months, as the siltation outside the Dagu Port is worsening and the Yongding River's water volume has also increased. The losses from this flood are incalculable. Finally, Mr. Ou stated that the association had already remitted 20,000 yuan to Tianjin several days ago, but this amount was small and had limited effect. They must continue to raise funds and hope that all sectors of society will provide generous donations, continuously delivering them to the association's office at 97 Renji Road. The chairman of the relief association is Mr. Song Hanzhang, and the Western chairman is Father Raoul de Jaegher.</p>
<h3>Another Handgun Robbery of Two Chinese Detectives on Yidingpan Road; Appears to Be a Planned Action</h3>
<p>The Yidingpan Road area on Route Tenant in Shanghai's western district is under extra-territoriality jurisdiction, bandits have been rampant lately, and the residents are in fear. The concession police authorities have been dispatching patrol teams day and night to patrol the area. At around 8 PM last night, two Chinese detectives from the Jing'an Temple police station, numbers 225 and 2810, were patrolling along Yidingpan Road when suddenly eight thugs swarmed forward and robbed the two detectives of their service handguns from their waists. Although the Chinese detectives struggled with all their might, they were outnumbered and disarmed. The bandits fled into the darkness, making it impossible to pursue and arrest them. The detectives returned to the police station to report the incident. It is understood that a similar incident occurred in Caojiadu the day before. It appears that these bandits are acting according to a planned strategy.</p>

<h3>Zhending Company Sued for Breach of Contract; Appeal Concluded, Awaiting Judgment; Jiang Liwu and Others Only Agreed to Refund the Deposit; Appellee Requested Maintenance of the Original Judgment</h3>
<p>Lawyer Wang Liwu, formerly partnered with local individuals Han Ouping and Bi Desheng to establish the Zhending Company in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road (Wang was the general manager, and Han was the assistant manager). They were previously sued in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court by Teng Zijin, an employee of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, for breach of contract and failure to deliver a property on time. The court found the claim to be true and ordered the defendants, Wang Liwu and others, to jointly deliver the property within two months. If they were unable to deliver the property, they would have to double the original deposit and pay a penalty of 1,400 yuan. Details have been reported in this newspaper. The defendants, dissatisfied with the initial judgment, filed an appeal with the Civil Court of the Third Branch of the Higher Court. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Xia Jinde, accompanied by Judges Wang and Tan, convened the Third Civil Court to hear the case. First, the appellants, Wang Liwu and Bi Desheng, stated their reasons for disagreeing with the original judgment, claiming that they admitted to refunding the appellee's deposit of 620 yuan but requested the dismissal of the remaining claims. They stated that Zhending Company had actually leased land on Fulili Road from individuals surnamed Xu, Huang, and Shen, and they submitted the lease agreement, the Municipal Council's survey documents, and accounting records for inspection. However, because the Municipal Council did not issue a permit, they were unable to proceed with construction. Furthermore, the contract stated that if a permit was not issued, the contract should be canceled. The court asked how much capital the company had, and Bi replied that he had personally invested 5,000 yuan, and the other participants had each pledged 1,000 yuan per share, but although they said so, they had not paid. Han Zhengping was represented by a lawyer who stated the reasons for disagreeing with the initial judgment. The appellee, Teng Zijin, was represented by lawyer Zhou Zhenhua who claimed that the appellee had previously purchased a property at 16 Zhengping Village, Fulili Road, from the appellants, and had paid a deposit of 700 yuan, and the property was to be delivered on September 15th, 1938. The appellants failed to deliver it on time, clearly breaching the contract. Upon reviewing the land lease agreement submitted by the appellants, it was only a draft. They had only paid a portion of the deposit and had not formally entered into a contract. Since a formal contract had not been established, how could they have entered into a contract with the appellee? Furthermore, upon reviewing the appellant's accounting records, they appeared brand new and contained the notation "discounted." Since the appellants were a large company building thousands of houses, they must have had dealings with banks. Why did they only discount at a money shop?</p>
<p>Additionally, the appellee's lawyer had inquired with the Municipal Council and found that the appellants had only requested the Municipal Council to survey the land and had not applied for a permit. Furthermore, if their capital was only 5,000 yuan, but they were building thousands of houses, costing 2,000 yuan per house, then a thousand houses would require two million yuan. It was clear that they were setting up a shell company with only 5,000 yuan in capital building thousands of houses. He requested the court to take note of this, uphold the original judgment, and dismiss the appeal. After the court reviewed the arguments, it declared the debate concluded and scheduled the judgment for the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Seditious Leaflets</h3>
<p>At around 8:30 PM last night, someone suddenly distributed a large number of multi-colored leaflets on the rooftop garden of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road and Yuchiaking Road. The content of the leaflets was extremely seditious and outrageous, such as "[...] in the September 18th national awakening movement, we are determined to expel the white people to establish the foundation for East Asian self-awareness and self-determination," and "commemorating September 18th, we will implement cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria." The police station dispatched officers to collect and file the leaflets for investigation.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Embezzles Funds Meant for Remittance, Squandering Them; Joy Turns to Sorrow as All Three Accomplices Face Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Bian Weibingrong, of Rongfeng Cotton Cloth Store, 34, Lane 31, Shanxi Road, entrusted his apprentice, Tian Haizhou, from Shaoxing (18 years old), with a check for 1,000 yuan and 3,985 yuan in legal currency on the 8th of this month to remit to the Chunyuan Money Exchange. Tian harbored malicious intentions and did not remit the funds. After embezzling the money and fleeing, he met with his friends Yuan Gengsheng from Henan and Gong Gengfu from Shanghai in room 300 at the Paramount Hotel on Yuyuan Road. Besides using the embezzled funds to purchase three diamond rings, three watches, and various fabrics and items, he engaged in gambling in various gambling dens in western Shanghai and sought pleasure with female guides. Wei Bingrong did not report the incident to the police station. However, the incident was discovered by Chinese detectives Huang Hairu and Zhu Xinwu of the General Police Station. On the morning of the day before yesterday, they first arrested Yuan Gengsheng at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road, and then proceeded to the Paramount Hotel to arrest Gong.</p>
<p>They recovered 1,445 yuan in cash, as well as diamond rings, watches, fabrics, and bedding, and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, charged them with embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, all the defendants confessed without denying. The court sentenced Tian, Yuan, and Gong to one year of imprisonment each as a warning. The stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Opening of National Goods United Distribution Center Scheduled</h3>
<p>Various domestic goods organizations and factories in this city, due to the market being flooded with foreign goods and the sales of domestic goods being crowded out over the years, see the recent outbreak of the European war and the soaring prices of foreign goods as a good opportunity to promote the domestic goods industry. Therefore, they specially organized the National Goods Manufacturers United Distribution Center, scheduled to open on Double Ten Day. The location is at 356-358 Nanjing Road, and the building will be completed soon. Internally, it is divided into various departments, including silk and satin, cloth, cotton textiles, knitwear, daily cosmetics, handicrafts, shoes and hats, canned food, porcelain, bamboo and rattan ware, toys, stationery, leather goods, suitcases, etc., covering almost all domestic goods. The office is located in Hengyuanli, Tianjin Road. Yesterday, it notified all industries to participate as much as possible. Once the registration quota is full, a lottery will be held for store locations. The following is a list of registration instructions: (1) To facilitate manufacturers in distributing goods, jointly promoting sales, and facilitating retail, to expand business, this distribution center is established to meet the rental needs of Chinese manufacturers. (2) All goods produced by Chinese manufacturers can participate in this distribution center for retail needs. (3) Manufacturers who wish to rent space or rooms in this distribution center should first obtain two copies of the registration form, fill them out clearly, and then send both registration forms to the management office of the distribution center for registration. (4) The registration form must be filled out in detail and legibly, without cursive writing. It must be stamped with the official seal and signed and sealed by the general manager to be valid. Applications without a seal will not be accepted. (5) After registration, the management office of the distribution center will issue a registration certificate to the registered manufacturer for verification. This registration certificate is valid for ten days, after which it will expire. (6) After a manufacturer's registration is reviewed and approved by the management office of the distribution center, a letter will be sent to notify them to collect the rental rules and lease agreement. After the manufacturer completes the procedures, they can rent the space. (7) If a manufacturer's registration is deemed unqualified by the management office of the distribution center after review, the registration form will be returned, and the registration certificate will be collected to complete the process. (8) This distribution center mainly focuses on the common products of various industries.</p>
<p>Due to limited space, regardless of the order of registration, the management office of the distribution center will review and approve applications. If an application is deemed unqualified, or if only one business is selected from an industry, the remaining applications will be rejected without objection. This is to be clearly understood.</p>
<h3>Prostitute's Madam Forces a Good Woman into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Qian Pusun, a Suzhou woman residing at Yongchangli, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou District, whose husband works as a sedan carrier and is addicted to opium, has a daughter named Qian Caixiu, fifteen years old this year. During the first month of this year, Qian Pusun, due to being pushed for financial reasons, sold Caixiu to the Tangji brothel at 8, Guidong Anli, Mintini Avenue, which was operated by Pan Axiu, a 49-year-old woman, for 140 yuan. Recently, the French Concession police suddenly received an anonymous letter from Suzhou, reporting that Qian's daughter had been sold and was being abused by the madam. The French police then ordered detectives to arrest Pan Axiu and Qian Caixiu at that address for investigation. Based on their confessions, Qian Pusun was also arrested and escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where they were charged in accordance with the law. Judge Jiang presided over the trial. The defendant, Pan Axiu, confessed that she bought Qian's daughter from a matchmaker this spring for 140 yuan, with a two-year contract. The defendant, Qian Pusun, confessed that because her husband was addicted to opium and they could not make a living, she sold her daughter to a brothel. The victim, Qian Caixiu, confessed that she was not a prostitute, but her parents had no food to eat and sold her to the brothel. The court, after examining the testimony, announced that the case's debate was closed and the judgment would be given on the 20th of this month. Pan Axiu was returned to custody, Qian Pusun was released on bail pending sentencing, and Qian Caixiu was taken back by Qian Pusun and was warned against selling her daughter again.</p>
<h3>Pu Hai Bank Debt Case; Creditor Group Files an Appeal</h3>
<p>Li Jingyan and others, representatives of the Pu Hai Bank creditor group in Minhang, filed an appeal regarding their request for the bank to repay deposits. The Second Branch of the Higher Court held a hearing at 9 AM on the 15th of this month, presided over by Han Zuzhi, the Presiding Judge of the Civil Court. The appellants were represented by lawyers Song Mingxun and Shen Yushan, and the appellees were represented by lawyers Cai Rudong and Gao Junxiang. First, lawyers Song and Shen stated the reasons for the appeal, arguing that a bank should be a corporate organization, and a corporation must have a license to be established. This is made clear by the Supreme Court's precedent No. 2535 of the 22nd year of the Republic. The appellees only presented evidence of registration in the original trial but did not present evidence of having a license, so the company could not be deemed to be legally established. Therefore, the debts it incurred should be the responsibility of the appellees for joint repayment. As for the Nanhua branch office, it was not registered but was a partnership, as stipulated in Article 5 of the registration rules. The debts incurred by that branch should also be the responsibility of the appellees for joint repayment. In addition, the original trial did not consider the savings accounts of various customers, and the request was made to handle them in accordance with Article 15 of the Savings Bank Law. Lawyers Cai and Gao, representing the appellees, then rose to respond, mainly relying on the wording of the original judgment. They did not present conclusive evidence regarding the license. Finally, the Presiding Judge asked each of the appellants about the evidence they presented and then announced the debate concluded, setting the judgment for the morning of the 20th.</p>
<h3>A Mainland Gambling Den Opens on Weihaiwei Road</h3>
<p>It was previously rumored that a club named "Mainland" would appear on Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession, which was actually a gambling den. A person surnamed Ma initially came forward to raise funds, but internal disagreements and the problem of permits being difficult to resolve almost caused the project to be abandoned. Later, a powerful person joined, promoting someone surnamed Xiang as the host, and the project proceeded smoothly, so it officially opened a few days ago. However, the entrance is very strict, and one cannot enter without an introduction from someone they know.</p>
<h3>Man Seeking Treatment for Gunshot Wound</h3>
<p>A man named Lü Ronglin, thirty years old, a native of Pudong, residing at No. 14, Rongxing Alley, Zhujia Ku, Haig Road, West Shanghai, hired a rickshaw yesterday morning around 2:00 AM to seek treatment at the nearby Red Cross Hospital for a gunshot wound to his leg. According to him, while he was sound asleep in bed, a stray bullet pierced through the wall and struck his right leg. The bullet went through, causing profuse bleeding. He was then taken to the hospital for treatment by rickshaw. However, as the location falls within the extraterritorial area, verification was not immediately possible.</p>
<h3>Leather Goods Store Burgled; Owner Extorted; Armed Robbery of 500 Yuan; Owner Injured Falling; Perpetrator Finally Arrested</h3>
<p>Dahua Leather Goods Store on Yu Qiaqing Road was burglarized of a large quantity of leather goods on January 18th. The incident was reported to the police. After investigation, detectives suspected Wang Gentao from Shanghai and Sun Shisheng from Pudong, both former employees of the store, of being the main culprits. They were planning to arrest them, but to their surprise, at 9:50 PM on the 21st, Wang and Sun, accompanied by two others, went to Dahua with two handguns. They forced the store owner, Shen Maoguang, to hand over 500 yuan in legal tender, threatening to kill him if he refused. Shen, in a moment of desperation, jumped out of the window to escape, severely injuring his lower back. Seeing the situation turning unfavorable, Wang and his accomplices scattered and fled. Afterwards, Wang sent threatening letters to Shen, urging him to quickly hand over the 500 yuan, or the entire family would be in danger. However, Shen was severely injured and remains in the hospital to this day. On the day before yesterday, Detective Xue Youwen of the Old Zhabei Police Station learned that Wang Gentao was waiting for his accomplices at the Dashin Company department store, plotting something illegal. He led Detectives Ding Yizhong and Zhou Wenqing to the location at 6:00 PM and apprehended Wang. Subsequently, Sun Shisheng was arrested at No. 1280, Jing'an Temple Road. After interrogation, they also arrested Zhou Zhimao (also known as Little Jiangbei), a native of Jiangbei, at No. 9, Lane 232, Caishi Road. Yesterday, they were all taken to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Chen Ming, explained the case. Due to the need for further investigation, he requested permission to temporarily detain them pending further investigation. After questioning by Feng Shide, the judge ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Abducted into Prostitution; Unable to Endure Abuse, Reports to Police; Brothel Owner Charged with Two Crimes</h3>
<p>Wang Lingmei (also known as Wang Anan), a local woman aged 19, lived alone in the Nanshi district. After the Shanghai war, she sought refuge in the concession but became separated from her family. In May of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), she was abducted and sold to Ge Arong and Ge Bai (i.e., Ge Pu), a couple from Suzhou who ran a brothel at No. 9, Lane 65, Shantou Road. From then on, the woman fell into the pit of fire and was forced into an inhuman existence.</p>
<p>Her suffering was indescribable. Over the past two years, Wang has given birth to a son named Genlin, who is now only one year and five months old. Despite having a son, she was still forced to continue her life of prostitution. On the 13th of this month, because Genlin wet the bed, the Ge couple severely beat and injured her. Unable to bear the suffering, she secretly reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station. Western Police Chief Fang Teerhua arrested the Ge couple at No. 101, Santao. It was also discovered that the Ge couple had been sentenced to six months in prison with a three-year suspended sentence by the Hankou District Court for a similar incident in Hankou. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the case, charging them with violating public morals under Article 231 of the Criminal Law and with assault under Article 277 of the same law. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, the case was adjourned for further review.</p>

<p>The French Concession Police dispatched a large number of detectives at approximately 7:00 AM on the 15th to raid a large-scale international morphine trafficking operation at a certain address in Dongqianjia Tang. Because the police are still investigating the case, the details have not yet been released.

<h3>Sand and Gravel Industry Association Mediates Dispute Among Members</h3>
<p>It is reported that Lu Xiaozuo, chairman of the Sand and Gravel Industry Association, who was arrested at a tea party of the Sand and Gravel Industry Association on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, was released on the same day. According to reports, the police took this action to ask him about the recent disputes among members of the sand and gravel industry. Since the Shanghai sand and gravel industry was controlled by the "Jiangnan Industrial Company" organized by the Japanese puppet regime, only one-third was allowed to be operated by various merchants. The members of the association had been in dispute over this one-third of the sand and gravel, and the association has now decided to start mediation at 4:00 PM today to avoid internal strife.</p>
<h3>Suicide Cases Recorded</h3>
<p>Liu Genfa: Liu Genfa, a 19-year-old local man, a resident of No. 1, Yuanyuan Hotel, next to the Grand Theater on Jiangxi Road, committed suicide by swallowing morphine poison in his room around 12:15 PM yesterday due to economic hardship.

<p>Wang Suzhen: Wang Suzhen, a 24-year-old local woman, residing at No. 1, Xicheng Alley, Avenue Moller, French Concession, had a quarrel with her mother over a minor family matter around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. Shortly after, taking advantage of the others' inattention, she secretly swallowed opium paste and committed suicide. She soon showed symptoms of poisoning and was discovered and taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Information on the Empress of Asia Liner: Arriving and Departing Today</h3>
<p>The Changxing Company's Empress of Asia liner, which departed from Vancouver on the 4th of this month for Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Luzon, was forced to stop sailing due to the outbreak of the Second European War. It was delayed in Shanghai for one day. The next day, it was ordered to proceed as usual. Therefore, it raised anchor on the evening of the 6th and sailed to Hong Kong and Luzon, delaying the sailing schedule by one day. The speed was increased en route, so the return trip from Luzon to Shanghai was still according to the original schedule, arriving at the port at 9:00 AM today, docking at the Hongkou Gonghexing Wharf. The passenger tender will depart from the Customs Wharf at 8:00 AM today. Passengers will be disembarked at the Customs Wharf between 9:15 and 10:15 AM.

The passenger tender will depart from the Customs Wharf at 3:30 PM.</p>
<h3>It's a Good Autumn Because the Weather is Cool</h3>
<p>Due to the southward advance of the northern cold air mass, the weather in this city is becoming autumnal. There was a light drizzle yesterday morning, which lasted for a long time before it stopped. However, the sky remained very gloomy. The Pacific hurricane continues to move northwest, but it is far from Shanghai, so the wind force is unknown. The high tide that started on the 14th of this month in the Huangpu River is still continuing. The tide will be particularly high around 2:00 PM today, and it will not subside until after the 19th.</p>
<h3>Lost Girl Waiting to be Claimed</h3>
<p>Wu Xianju, a lost girl, is 6 years old and from Ganpu, Zhejiang. She was lost in the jurisdiction of the Putuo Road Police Station in the Shanghai Public Concession on May 13th of this year. She was sent to the Jiliang Institute by the police and then sent to the Children's Shelter of the Bureau of Public Works' Children's Welfare Department. According to the Children's Shelter, there has been no sign of anyone looking for the girl since she was lost. There are now reputable, upper-class families, who adhere to Christianity, planning to adopt the girl as an adopted daughter. In addition to promising to be responsible for her education, they will also take care of her marriage and provide her with inheritance rights. However, the Children's Shelter still hopes that the girl's parents will come to claim her within one month. Otherwise, it will be regarded as intentional abandonment, and the child will be fully placed. Her parents should not delay.</p>
<h3>Police Seeking Identification of Murdered Man</h3>
<p>On the 7th of this month, an unidentified Chinese man (see photo) was found lying on the side of the road across from No. 50 on Medhurst Road (50 yards from Dahua Road) with axe wounds. He was immediately taken to Baolong Hospital by the fire department's ambulance, but he had already died. Anyone who can identify the photo is requested to report to the Jing'an Temple Police Station.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the news report in your newspaper yesterday about the arrest of Lu Xiaozuo, chairman of the Sand and Gravel Association, the statements made therein are inconsistent with the facts. I have never participated in the "Jiangnan Company" and have never entered into a contract with the Maibian Foreign Company to supply yellow sand. How could there be a situation of violation of the arrest? It is obviously someone who is slandering and framing me out of spite. In addition to secretly investigating and handling the matter, I hereby make a statement, and I hope you will correct it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lu Xiaozuo, September 16th</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Having read the news report in your newspaper on the 10th of this month, "The Price of Pigments is Rising Sharply, and Various Dye Factories Refuse to Dye Materials", it is completely inconsistent with the facts. Leaving aside the situation of the entire industry, as far as our factory is concerned, although the price of pigments has risen sharply, it is not due to a shortage of goods. Our factory can purchase at high prices and can dye as much as needed. Therefore, business is as usual, and there is no refusal to dye. Your newspaper's report is likely based on inaccurate rumors. I am sending this letter to inform you and hope that you will correct it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lao Zhenghe Maoji Dye Factory, September 16th</p>

<h3>Conduct</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>In class, the teacher sometimes says to the students: "Recently, the conduct of many students has been too bad..." When the students hear this, they immediately straighten their backs, close their mouths tightly, look at their noses, and sit respectfully and silently.</p>
<p>Most children think that to have good conduct, they just need to not speak, not move, and the more like an old person they are, the more qualified they are. This concept is completely wrong and must be corrected.</p>
<p>Dear children, we should know that good or bad conduct is not in these trivial matters, and that being lively and expressing oneself are fundamentally good behaviors.</p>
<p>I believe that good or bad conduct depends on our attitude towards others. If a child is willing to work hard, is responsible, hardworking, and can take care of public property and help others, then that is a child with good conduct. If they are jealous of others and only do things for their own benefit, then even if that child sits still all day, their conduct cannot be considered good. If they do bad things but pretend to be well-behaved, then the badness of their conduct goes without saying.</p>
<p>Many children like or hope to receive rewards and compliments from others, which is also a loss in terms of conduct. Why? Because we should strive for good conduct, but not to seek rewards or compliments. Because when this kind of mentality is formed, it is easy to be fake in doing things, and very prone to pride and arrogance.</p>
<p>Perhaps some children will ask me, "How can I be an excellent student with good conduct?" To answer this question cannot be done in a few words. To put it succinctly: first, do more things that benefit others and the public; second, be able to reflect on yourself at all times; third, read more books that are beneficial to your body and mind; and fourth, participate in social activities in many ways.</p>
<h3>The Huitong Bridge Filled with Flesh and Blood</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Nine hundred and seventy-two kilometers of highway, three hundred and seventy highway bridges, one million four hundred thousand cubic feet of stone masonry, nearly ten million cubic feet of earthwork, but without a single machine, without using a huge amount of the national treasury, relying only on the rush construction of twenty-five million migrant workers, this Yunnan-Burma Road has been fully opened to traffic in just five months. When you read the history and geography lesson about Yunnan, have you ever thought of this highway filled with flesh and blood?</p>
<p>During the construction of this highway, there are many moving and remarkable historical materials worth remembering. Now I will only introduce to the children one of the three hundred and seventy bridges, the Huitong Bridge. Huitong Bridge is a large bridge over the Nu River. Children have already read about the Nu River in textbooks. Its water is turbulent and its temperament is violent. I don't need to describe it much. One sentence can include its nature, that is, it is like a giant python.</p>
<p>When this bridge was being built, three kinds of workers were requisitioned: Indian ironworkers, Guangdong carpenters from the source of the revolution, and Yunnan stonemasons with experience in building the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. In order to make the bridge body strong enough to carry thousands of tons of steel, chestnut wood must be used as the material, but this chestnut wood is not a wood that can be found everywhere. They are all hidden deep in the primeval forests of the mountains. It takes seven or eight days to travel, touching cliffs and in and out of thorny forests, to cut down the wood from there and supply it to this modern construction project. Hundreds of workers have to constantly search in the dark ancient forests, waving their hands non-stop.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the construction of the Huitong Bridge only utilized the existing piers and strengthened the original load-bearing capacity. If it were to be like the other bridges, starting the foundation work first, I don't know how much more flesh and blood would be filled under the bridge. Speaking of this, we cannot but thank Mr. Liang Jinshan, a compatriot from Burma, who, in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), donated a huge sum of money to build an iron cable bridge to facilitate travelers, because he saw how many compatriots died on bamboo rafts crossing the river every year. Now, it has similarly saved a lot of sweat and blood for this project.</p>
<p>In this project, at least one-eighth of the number sacrificed for the sake of the country's future, most of which were due to a kind of miasma and other engineering dangers. But are we really going to let this group of nameless heroes sleep silently underground without a sound?</p>

<h3>The Third Home</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—Ming'er's Refuge Record Thirty-four—</p>
<p>Ming'er's family drifted around and traveled all over the mountains and rivers. It was really unexpected that they would build a third home in a foreign land thousands of miles away from their hometown. However, the construction costs - a lot of money, long treks, and endless energy - were also considerable.</p>
<p>After arriving at their destination, they were fortunate to have Mr. Zhang to take care of them, and everything was taken care of. Otherwise, I don't know how chaotic it would have been. The local residents also expressed sympathy for them with a pitying attitude, and seemed very willing to help. Mr. Zhang even found a flat house in a corner of the village to serve as Ming'er's third home. Ming'er's father was of course very grateful for his enthusiasm, and the rent was surprisingly cheap. It turned out that the house belonged to Mr. Zhang's relatives. They originally said they didn't want rent, but Ming'er's father always felt it was inappropriate, so in the end he paid one yuan a month as rent. Ming'er's father thanked him again and again. The people in that village were really treating them to the extreme.</p>
<p>The environment of Ming'er's third home is very good - distant mountains surround all sides, serving as their barrier. There is a mountain stream on the west side, flowing gurgling all day long. To the south are criss-crossing fields. To the northeast are neighbors. Behind the house is a patch of grassland, which is a paradise for pigs, cows, and sheep. The structure of this house is very different from Ming'er's hometown: in the center of the house is a living room without windows, which cannot block the cold wind in winter. In front of the hall is a narrow patio, with a tank in the middle facing the living room (it is said that the houses in that village are all the same due to feng shui). Therefore, the doors all open on the side. On both sides of the living room are two small bedrooms, with only one small window hole. The inside is terribly dark, and the air has a turbid smell. Even Ming'er's younger siblings dare not step into it during the day.</p>
<p>This is completely unlike the brightness of the houses in my hometown. It is simply impossible to find a large and bright bedroom in that village. This is a very deep impression for Ming'er.</p>
<p>The house is there, but what about the utensils in the house? Ming'er's family didn't even have a long bench, and the family's necessities - bed, table, chairs, stove, firewood... were extremely complicated. Buy them one by one? It's too expensive, and this home is temporary. Fortunately, the landlady is very polite, but because the two sides don't speak the same language, Mr. Zhang explained to Ming'er's mother: the landlady has everything at home, so there's no need to buy anything. Just write a note and they can move it in. That made Ming'er's whole family extremely grateful. The landlady also personally brought the things Ming'er's family needed from her home outside the alley. Her feet were small and not agile, and she was already over fifty years old, which made Ming'er's mother very uneasy, so she asked Ming'er and others to help. Such a landlady is rare. It took about two days of busy work to get everything in order, and this third home was somewhat presentable. During these busy two days, Ming'er's family temporarily did not cook, because what pots, what firewood, etc. had to be prepared by themselves and had not been bought yet, so they had to eat at Mr. Zhang's house. After two days, everything was finally ready, but where to buy vegetables? In that village, except for meat, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, everything else was not sold, because the families in this village always had some open space to grow some vegetables, which was enough for the needs of a family, but what should Ming'er's family do? The landlady was so good that she picked some vegetable skins (the villagers all eat vegetable skins and let the vegetable hearts grow) from the vegetables grown in her own field and gave them to them. Ming'er's mother was very grateful. If a hawker came to the alley with some vegetables or the like, she would always help him return the good and cheap price and personally take the scales to Ming'er's house to make gestures (because they didn't speak the same language) to inform him. When Ming'er's mother saw her scales, she understood her meaning.</p>
<p>"The third home was built entirely with the help of the landlady. We are very lucky that people are taking care of us everywhere." One night, Ming'er's mother muttered.</p>
<h3>Scientific Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Moyan</p>
<p>Why can water extinguish fire?</p>
<p>Children! If you dip a burning candle into water, the candle will quickly go out. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>The original burning of a candle only requires air, (especially the oxygen in the air), and does not require water. Now, when the candle is immersed in water, the water prevents the air from coming into contact with the fire. Without air, the fire will naturally be extinguished.</p>
<p>We can also use other methods to put out the fire, such as throwing a quilt or blanket over it, or sprinkling yellow sand on the fire. Because quilts, blankets, and yellow sand can prevent air from coming into contact with fire, the fire will be extinguished as a result.</p>
<p>Why does blowing out a candle make it go out?</p>
<p>When we want to extinguish a burning match or a candle, we never splash water on them, we only need to blow a breath at them to quickly extinguish the fire. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>If we want to strike a match, we must first heat it up, rub it on the side of the matchbox, or touch it to something hot, and then it will catch fire. So, how do we extinguish it? Just make it cold again, how do we make it cold again? Just blow on it. So we blow on a match to cool it down and extinguish it.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Price Increase of Towels</h3>
<p>— (Moxi)</p>
<p>Towels are completely domestic products and do not seem to have much to do with foreign exchange, but recently the prices have also soared. According to people in the industry, the pigments for printing must be imported. Now that the price of pigments has risen, printed towels cost six or seven cents more per dozen than plain white towels. If the price of pigments rises again, the price of towels will inevitably rise to an alarming extent.</p>
<p>I think, wiping your face requires cleanliness, so you can use plain white towels. Why must you have colored ones? We are now vigorously practicing thrift, and we should pay special attention to daily necessities. Plain white towels are clean and hygienic, elegant and economical, and it is very easy to implement the change. It is even more convenient than not smoking paper cigarettes and changing to dry tobacco. I hope that friends with ideals and節exercise will all come to promote and implement it.</p>
<p>It is not difficult for cotton mills to stop making colored毛, but if the general users who love colored products do not change their mentality, then they will instead promote business for imported products. Therefore, this small movement should be promoted to the public. (Unpaid)</p>

<h3>The Animal Realm (18)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>After Peng Qi recovered from his illness, the first thing he insisted on when going downstairs was to see Lufu. He had it brought to the guest room. It turned out that he had gone through hardships with this curly-haired dog, and his feelings for it were particularly good. The servant went to open the dog house and released Lufu. Lufu had been missing Peng Qi very much, and immediately rushed into the room. As soon as it reached the front hall, it smelled Peng Qi's scent and rushed to the guest room without the servant's guidance. Peng Qi heard the tinkling of the bell and knew that Lufu had arrived, so he quickly stood up and opened his arms to greet it. Lufu barked as if it wasn't barking, then pounced into Peng Qi's arms, then collapsed and fell to the ground. Was it dead? Yes, Lufu was dead. That bark was an expression of indescribable joy. Its body was already extremely weak. Seeing its little master and receiving an unexpected stimulus, it died of happiness due to over-stimulation.</p>
<p>Peng Qi lost a loyal friend and was very sad. Tears of sorrow dripped onto his scarred little face, completely dispelling his cruel nature. Although he had committed many sins before, he now only wanted to repent. From then on, he became particularly kind to animals and became a good friend to them. Eventually, he became a first-rate expert in animal studies. From ancient times to the present, many naughty children, as long as they reform and strive for improvement, can later become extraordinary people. Peng Qi was just one example.</p>
<p>After Peng Qi fully recovered his health, he and his two younger sisters jointly cared for animals and opened a small animal yard at home, as their animal realm. Peng Qi wanted to find another shaggy dog like Lufu, but he couldn't find one, so he made Nuokesi his only friend. He said, "I want to make a dog that knows Lufu my friend, to keep a permanent memory. If Nuokesi doesn't hold my past misdeeds against me, I believe I am now worthy of being its friend." How could Nuokesi hold his past misdeeds against him? They had saved its life. Now seeing him treat it well, it would naturally be loyal to him, just like Lufu was in life.</p>
<p>Peng Qi slowly saved his pocket money, and when he had accumulated a substantial sum, he erected a monument on Lufu's grave. The monument was engraved with these words: "In memory of a loyal friend, who was rough in appearance but gentle in heart. Died of happiness in a certain year and month upon seeing his master recover from illness." (The End)</p>

<h3>Random Recollections of Chrysanthemum Matters (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>During the Xuantong reign of the late Qing Dynasty, there were four outstanding young actors in Peking Opera specializing in the "xusheng" (bearded male) roles: Guan Dayuan, Xiao Xiangyuan, Jin Si Hong, and Xiao Chang Geng. All four excelled in portraying calm expressions and clear articulation. However, they failed to maintain lasting fame. The whereabouts of Xiao Xiangyuan and Xiao Chang Geng are unknown. Jin Si Hong retired to teach at the Fu Lian Cheng opera school. Guan Dayuan, despite having collaborated with Shang Xiaoyun, Cheng Yanqiu, and Xu Biyun, ultimately remained undeveloped. Such was the fate of the four outstanding young "xusheng" actors of the late Qing Dynasty! Among young actors in southern China specializing in "xusheng" roles, such as Xiao Gui Fen (i.e., Zhang Gui Fen) in his early years and Xiao Yang Yuelou in the early Republic, both displayed remarkable talent. Additionally, Yu Shuyan and Yang Baozhong in northern China were renowned in Tianjin during their childhoods. However, few who displayed early talent ultimately achieved great success. The vicissitudes of Peking Opera often result in fleeting brilliance, like the ephemerality of the Dutchman's pipe. It is unknown how many others have experienced this. Xiao Xiangyuan was also able to comb his hair into three strands and dress as a "qingyi" (female) role, but this was only occasional amusement and should not be delved into by those discussing opera.</p>
<p>Moreover, old Peking had its "Four Flowers": Lan Weipei Yu (Orchid), Shui Xian Xiaoxia (Daffodil), Shao Yao Wanhua (Peony), and Tu Mi Yufu (Rose). Yao Yuanchu had a poem on the "Four Flowers and Seven Memories," each poem alluding to a specific event. Today, only Wanhua remains prominent in the Peking Opera scene. Yufu has retired to assist the Mei Lanfang troupe, not using her stage name but becoming wealthy, demonstrating her skill. As for Peiyu and Xiaoxia, people today do not even know their names, let alone that they were once among the "Four Flowers." Recording this article, I cannot help but feel the vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>Around 1913-1914, female Peking Opera performers rose to prominence in the old capital, causing a sensation. There were Dan actors such as Liu Xikui, Jin Yulan, Xiao Xiangshui, Jin Gangzuan, Xiao Jufen, and Du Yunhong; Qingyi actors such as Bai Suchen and Jin Yuelan; Wusheng actors such as Zhao Ziyun and Gui Yunfeng; Laodan actors such as Shang Junqing; and Jing actors such as Jin Fengkui, all of whom were renowned. At that time, performers like Zhang Xiaoxian and Li Guifen were not yet famous. Among them, Shang Junqing, although playing Laodan roles, was refined and elegant, standing out from the crowd. Furthermore, Bai Suchen's Qingyi performance adhered to the norms, not inferior to male performers. The owner of Lingxiao Hange wanted to keep her as a mistress, but she was ultimately obtained by my teacher, Mr. Chen Aosheng of Yinxian. After leaving the stage in 1919, she returned to the stage, but she was no longer the same as before. It is true that for people in this profession, five years can seem like a lifetime.</p>
<p>Artiste Life</p>
<h3>Ren Guang and An E</h3>
<p>— An Lan</p>
<p>Ren Guang and An E, the authors of popular film songs such as "Fisherman's Song" and "Wolf Fighting Song," were originally a passionate couple who had lived together for a long time but had never held a wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>Before the August 13th Incident, Ren Guang went to Paris to study music. Now he has returned to China and transferred to Chongqing, the new capital, to teach at the Art Institute founded by Mr. Tao Xingzhi. At the same time, he is also leading Chongqing's famous singing group. It is said that he is also preparing to go abroad again in the near future.</p>
<p>An E is not only active in Chongqing's music groups, but she has also joined the New Life Women's Work Corps led by Madam Chiang. In addition, whenever she has free time, she desperately writes patriotic lyrics for various music groups and singing groups to perform together.</p>
<p>Now, this pair of famous Chinese songwriters, a couple who had gone through hard times together, have met again in Chongqing. It is inevitable that their old love will rekindle. However, according to their close friends, they value their sacred work more than their personal feelings. This is worth emulating by those who only talk about "saving the country through love."</p>
<p>(Editor's note) It is rumored that An E is cohabitating with a certain military officer in Chongqing, while this article says that she and Ren Guang are still in love as before. What is the actual situation of An E? We hope that friends in the new capital will provide confirmation.</p>
<h3>Talking About Wang Chuansong</h3>
<p>— Dong Cun Jushi</p>
<p>In Kun Opera troupes, the "Jing" role is called "Dahua Mian" (big painted face), the "Fu" role is called "Erhua Mian" (second painted face), and the "Chou" role is called "Xiaohua Mian" (small painted face). The terms for "Chou" and "Jing" are the same in Peking Opera troupes. The "Fu" role is particularly important in Kun Opera troupes, because loyalty, righteousness, and filial piety must be contrasted with treachery and deceit. Tang Biaobei in "A Handful of Snow," and Cao Cao in "Discussing the Sword" and "Offering the Sword" are all treacherous "Fu" roles. Zhang Sanlang in "Water Margin" and Ximen Qing in "Righteous Heroes" both contain elements of eroticism. Recently, Wang Chuansong's masterpieces "Borrowing Boots," "Dog Hole," and "Inviting a Doctor" have been popular. Chuansong began learning his art later than Chuanming and Chuanjian, but his dialogue, facial expressions, and demeanor are all excellent. Shanghai people who enjoy listening to storytelling must come to listen to the music every other day, paying attention to Chuansong's dialogue, because it is humorous and lively, with winking eyes and shrugged shoulders, washing away the depression in our hearts.</p>
<p>In "Nai He Tian," Chuansong plays Que Buquan, who is one-eyed, lame, and hunchbacked. His movements and actions are just like a rich young master who is illiterate, truly a masterpiece of nature, reaching perfection. The scenes "Misunderstanding" and "Drunken Fragrance" are hilarious, with an ugly man getting a beautiful wife, his foolish state making people laugh. Combined with Zhu Chuanming's Zou Shi and Zhang Chuanfang's Wu Shi, they complement each other, and viewers still praise them to this day. The melody and pronunciation, with the yin and yang of the words, the length of the tunes, the high and low pitches, and the fast and slow tempos, cannot deviate from the flute score by even a fraction. Chuansong performs with stage steps and gestures that follow the rules, and his singing is natural. My friend, Layman Suxiang, is deeply knowledgeable in this art, saying that listening to Chuansong's play is like climbing a high mountain to watch the idle clouds and wild birds, changing in an instant, truly knowing that a clever person has his own talent. Now he is performing in "Fairy Rainbow," and his future is limitless. If you don't believe me, why not go and see it.</p>

<p>New Movie Intro</p>
<h3>Coffee Waitress</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Good Girls Go To Paris"</p>
<p>Comedy, comedy, another humorous comedy.</p>
<p>The story of "Coffee Waitress" is pieced together from beginning to end by "coincidence." From Jenny, a girl who works as a waitress in a university tea room, to New York, a complex erotic entanglement unfolds, and she finally marries Professor Ronnie. The Olaf family, deliberately depicted by the playwright, is exactly what we are used to seeing in big cities. Every character is willful and deceitful, pursuing their own selfish desires and wasting their lives at the same time. Let's take a look at the Olaf family:</p>
<p>Grandfather Olaf is stubborn and confused, almost neurotic; Mother Caroline has a young boyfriend; son Tom is a wanderer by nature; daughter Shirley is in love with the old servant's son, Dennis.</p>
<p>Alexander Hall's directorial skills are very strong. He dissects each character in this family very clearly, and his delicate and exquisite carving is seen in the following two examples.</p>
<p>(1) Jenny arrived at the Olaf home, and Mother Caroline falsely claimed that she was a classmate of her daughter Shirley, who came to attend the wedding, winning the heart of grandfather Olaf. At breakfast the next day, the astonishment of son Tom, the feigned kindness of the daughter and Jenny were all handled very vividly. After University Professor Ronnie (Shirley's fiancé) arrived, an even more lively scene unfolded.</p>
<p>(2) On the evening of Shirley and Ronnie's wedding, the director had to unravel such a complex love entanglement at the same time, and his calm and unhurried technique was rare. For example, Caroline was tempted by her boyfriend Paul and was about to elope with him. Jenny deliberately tempted Paul to dissuade Caroline. But grandfather Olaf announced the news of his grandson Tom and Jenny's engagement, which shocked Paul and Ronnie. Suddenly, a lawyer came to see Olaf, saying that Jenny and Dennis were out on the town at night, and their car hit a passerby, who was now disabled, requesting compensation. In fact, it was Shirley who was out on the town with Dennis, and she lied and said it was Jenny. And Jenny, because Tom owed a gambler five thousand dollars and couldn't repay it, Jenny admitted to Shirley's impersonation, using the five thousand dollars as a condition to repay Tom's gambling debt. But Ronnie knew that Jenny had not been out on the town that night, and forced her to question, only then did she reveal everyone's secrets.</p>
<p>Melvyn Douglas's University Professor Ronnie is very steady. Joan Blondell's Jenny played the frivolous and dissolute part in the first half very well, but the self-sacrifice and psychological conflicts in the second half were not prominent enough. Walter Connolly is the most successful actor in this film, because his actions and words can grasp the character of Olaf.</p>
<p>The Nanfeng Drama Society is scheduled to hold its first experimental public performance at the Xiqiao Lane Xianle Grand Theater at 9:30 am on Sunday, the 17th. The repertoire includes three one-act plays: "The Fool," "Two Difficult Friends," and "Setting Free." Ticket prices are one yuan, six cents, and four cents.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dramatic Arts Society will suspend performances for two days on the 17th and 18th due to martial law, and will stage "The Beginning of Man" from the 19th, which is worth seeing.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Story of Wang Keqin's Union and Separation with Zhang Xun</p>
<p>Keqin was also an unforgiving shrew. Anyone who had seen her perform in "Killing the Son for Revenge" would be terrified of her. When quarreling, she would shout, "I was forced by you men to be your concubine, who cares about being the wife of a pigtail general!" She was originally justified, and even Zhang Xun would sometimes feel guilty when he heard it, but he couldn't help her. Coincidentally, Keqin gave birth to a son, named Mengfan, and therefore became even more arrogant. Speaking of this son, there was also a strange story. Outside the South Gate of Xuzhou City, there was a tomb of Fan Zeng, which the people of Xuzhou called Tushan. According to legend, King Xiang of Chu fell for the counter-espionage plot of the Han Dynasty, and therefore suspected Zeng, so Zeng abandoned Yu and left. Later, a carbuncle erupted on his back and he died. Yu's soldiers dug up soil to bury him, which was more than ten feet high. Next to it was a river called Shajia Wang, which was said to be the place where the soil was dug up that year. On the day Wang gave birth to her son, she suddenly dreamed that Fan Zeng entered her womb, so she named him Mengfan. Whether this was actually the case, or whether she was using this to ingratiate herself and deliberately deceive Zhang Xun, is something that outsiders could not know. However, since giving birth to her son, Keqin was even more favored by Zhang Xun, and the young concubine gradually fell out of favor. She eventually became blind due to jealousy and depression, and her temper became irritable. Not long after, Zhang Xun took another concubine named Xiaocui. In order to retaliate against Keqin, Xiaocui tried her best to win her over, slandering Keqin in front of Zhang. Later, when Zhang took refuge in the Dutch embassy, he ordered each concubine to take turns sleeping with him. Keqin was ashamed and unwilling to go, and was therefore hated by Zhang Xun. Cui and others, knowing that Zhang deeply hated opium, induced Keqin to smoke it. When Zhang came out, the two angers merged into one, and he threatened to kill Keqin, but in reality, it was just intimidation. Keqin was greatly afraid, so she ran away from Zhang and resumed performing on the old Gong Stage in Shanghai. However, at that time, her beauty had faded and her addiction was deep, so her appeal was naturally much weaker. (103)</p>

<h3>Germany's Policies and Strategies</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>Harvesting from the Soviet Union, Miscalculation with Britain</p>
<p>Unwilling to Expand the War</p>
<p>If we do not understand the actual truth and only look at the surface, we will often feel as if we have fallen into a maze and cannot get a correct judgment. For example, after Germany attacked Poland, Britain and France had already mobilized and attacked Germany's western border, and Germany was also sharpening its swords and preparing to fight to the death. However, German officials still propagandized that Germany was willing to eliminate centuries-old feuds with France, resolve suspicions, and reconcile. Germany had no territorial demands on France. Even if France attacked Germany, Germany would only limit itself to retaliation. It also said that France's involvement in the war was entirely directed by Britain. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's statement on the Anglo-German negotiations in Danzig also severely criticized Britain, saying that any responsibility for causing the war should be borne by Britain.</p>
<p>What Is Feared Is Britain</p>
<p>From the above remarks, we can see two intentions of the German side. First, Germany is unwilling to expand the war. Second, Germany did not expect Britain's attitude to be so firm, so it is very afraid and hates Britain's standing on the French side to help Poland and fight against Germany. We know that Germany's war against Poland initially followed the old trick of fascism, trying to use the Nazi Party in Danzig, such as Forster and others, to organize secret armies and implement the so-called Critical War, overthrowing the original government of Danzig in one fell swoop, and carrying out Germany's conspiracy to occupy Danzig. However, this year's Polish government was not as easy to subdue as last year's Czech government. And Britain and France, wary of the viciousness of Germany's means of destroying Czechoslovakia in March of this year, did not allow Germany to put Czechoslovakia into Nazi hands as last year, after the mediation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, by holding a four-power conference. Under these circumstances, Germany took the risk and resorted to military force against Poland. It is impossible to say that Germany's aggression against Poland did not take into account France's assistance. But with only France, Germany can still cope easily. If Britain is added to France, that is what Germany fears most.</p>
<p>Eliminate Worries in the East</p>
<p>In Hitler's "Mein Kampf," which is regarded as the bible by the Nazis, Hitler severely criticized Wilhelm II's diplomatic policy during the last World War, which alienated both Britain and Russia, thus later making Germany have to fight on both the eastern and western battlefields militarily. Therefore, he strongly opposed naval competition with Britain, arousing Britain's resentment. At the same time, he also advocated avoiding competition with Britain for colonies and overseas trade, so that Britain would not interfere with Germany's actions on the European continent, and Germany would have the spare capacity to implement its territorial policy (BodenPolitik), which is the policy of developing towards Eastern Europe. The conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact relieved Hitler of his worries in the east, which can be said to be a partial success of his diplomatic policy. He also knew that Britain and France did not have geographical connections with Poland. If Poland fought against Germany, Britain and France would not be able to send troops to Poland to jointly fight and resist Germany. Therefore, as soon as the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact was established, Hitler launched a war against Poland with lightning speed, and that was the reason.</p>
<p>Temporarily Take a Defensive Posture in the West</p>
<p>Hitler's current strategy is of course to take a defensive posture in the West and use all his strength to attack Poland. After defeating Poland, he will return to the West and deal with Britain and France. The question is, can Germany, which lacks raw materials, wage a protracted war under the naval blockade of Britain and France? After the British and French navies blockaded Germany, all German shipping was cut off. All supplies, although dependent on neighboring neutral countries, but Britain and France will inevitably actively exercise diplomatic means against neutral countries in the future, so that they do not assist the belligerent countries, there is no doubt. This is the point that Germany fears and hates most about Britain's superior naval power.</p>
<p>Hope That Italy Can Mediate</p>
<p>In addition, Germany's current isolation is another reason for its anxiety. When the Danzig issue was most tense, Mussolini, another giant of the Axis powers, advised Hitler to be cautious. After the war broke out, Mussolini cited Germany's use of force to resolve the Danzig issue, which he was trying to resolve peacefully, believing that Germany's action undermined Italy's guarantee. Therefore, he decided to temporarily maintain neutrality. Although the German side unilaterally explained Italy's neutrality, saying that Italy's action made Britain and France's attitude towards Italy uncertain, which was more beneficial to Germany, it was actually just an excuse. In fact, who guarantees that Italy will not repeat the old trick of temporarily dismantling the stage in the last World War? Therefore, Germany has almost become a lonely figure on the international political stage, and its depression is conceivable. Now Germany is releasing the argument that it does not want to expand the war and does not want to attack France, as well as recently expressing that the two countries, Germany and Italy, still maintain the axis policy. Its intention is of course still to have Italy come out to mediate. After winning the victory in the attack on Poland, it can still obtain considerable rewards and stop, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of the last World War. But I don't know whether Britain, which wants to "destroy Nazism before it stops," is only making empty threats against Germany with such a claim, or whether it will be thorough.</p>
<h3>The National Defense New Army on the Northern Battlefield - The 10th Army Corps</h3>
<p>Commanded by General Shi Yousan, Engaged in Battles Across Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi Provinces</p>
<p>Perhaps the name of the 10th Army Corps may feel a bit unfamiliar to the people in the rear? But on the northern battlefield, the mention of the 10th Army Corps is known by everyone. It is a powerful elite force, a strong and massive power. It is a group of North China's sons and daughters closely united under the banner of national revolution, under the leadership of the brave General Shi Yousan.</p>
<p>For the past two years, pursuing the fleeing enemy without stopping, the brothers of the 10th Army Corps have worked hard, truly hard. They have galloped across the vast plains of Hebei, climbed the towering Wangwu Mountains, Zhongtiao Mountains, and the intricate mountainous areas of southern Shandong. They cherish their hometown so much that they have never left North China for two years. North China is the hometown where they grew up, and they are unwilling to leave it until death.</p>
<p>General Shi Yousan is the sole leader of the 10th Army Corps. It is truly fortunate that tens of thousands of strong men in North China can have such a wise and decisive leader. Mr. Shi is very strict in managing the army. In the Northwest Army, the mention of "King Yama" Shi brings chills to everyone's spines. Therefore, in every decisive battle, unless there is an order to retreat, the soldiers would rather die than leave the front lines.</p>
<p>The Growth of the 10th Army Corps</p>
<p>Like other troops, the 10th Army Corps has grown and strengthened day by day. Its origin was the North Hebei Security Command before the July 7th Incident. The troop had a total of more than 8,000 people.</p>
<p>The flames of the Lugou Bridge Incident ignited, and the great wave of Chinese national liberation was stirred up. A part of the security team once guarded the Lugou Bridge and made extremely glorious sacrifices. Subsequently, the security team transferred to Machang and Cangzhou, and was officially reorganized into the 181st Division. From then on, the North Hebei Security Team transformed into a formal national army.</p>
<p>In Cangzhou, the 181st Division was replaced by Liu Duoquan's army, and then fought with the Japanese in the Qingfeng-Daming area. In late January of last year, it was replaced by the 32nd Army, guarding the Tangyin front line of the Pinghan Railway. In early February, the Japanese surged south from Anyang like a tide. In order to avoid significant sacrifices, the Chinese army lured the Japanese deep into the area and then retreated along the Daoqing Railway into the mountainous areas of southern Shanxi, where they fought countless bloody battles and won numerous glorious victories, large and small. It was in the Zhongcun of Qinshui that Division Commander Shi was officially promoted to Commander of the 69th Army by the central government. In addition to the original 181st Division, the New 6th Division of the 29th Army (Commander was Gao Shuxun) was also assigned to the command of the 69th Army. Commander Shi smiled, and the brothers of the 181st Division also smiled. A glorious future filled everyone's hearts. That day, everyone celebrated all night, and the valleys of the Zhongtiao Mountains were filled with the joyful songs of the soldiers.</p>
<p>When the Battle of Taierzhuang became critical, the brave men of the 69th Army became eager and their blood boiled. They wanted to rush to Taierzhuang. Coincidentally, at this time, they received an order from the central government to reinforce Taierzhuang. The soldiers smiled because the opportunity to serve the country had come.</p>
<p>Growing Up in Battle</p>
<p>Arriving in Taierzhuang in early May, they were assigned to guard the right wing of Taierzhuang. They were then ordered to advance towards Tai'an, but on the way, Xuzhou fell, and the troops stayed in southern Shandong. In southern Shandong, the 69th Army harassed the Japanese on the one hand and worked on building fortifications on the other. After three months of hard work, the cultural level of the soldiers improved, the vacancies in each regiment and battalion were filled, and more than one division of new recruits were formed into a temporary division. At the same time, guerrilla teams from all over southern Shandong came to join them. For a time, the troops bearing the designation of the 69th Army numbered nearly 100,000 men, and the 69th Army had grown stronger.</p>
<p>In mid-August, Army Commander Shi was promoted to Commander of the 10th Army Corps. Needless to say, a smile filled the face of Commander Shi, and the brothers of the 69th Army cheered again in the valleys and plains of southern Shandong.</p>
<p>The development and growth of the 10th Army Corps in the past two years is due to the strong leadership of Commander Shi and the bravery of the soldiers, which has enabled the 10th Army Corps to shed its old Northwest Army shell and move towards the path of a new national defense army.</p>
<h3>General Shi Yousan</h3>
<p>Economic Knowledge</p>
<h3>Bullion</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiangqin</p>
<p>I. Organization of the Shanghai Gold Market</p>
<p>The Shanghai gold trading market initially used the Gold Industry Association as its venue. It was not until after 1920 that formal gold trading market organizations were established. At that time, two were established one after another: one was the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange, and the other was the Shanghai Gold Exchange. Later, in 1937, the former was ordered to merge its gold department into the latter. Thus, the Shanghai Gold Exchange became the only gold market in Shanghai. Although the gold traded in the exchange is said to include domestic gold mines, gold bars and coins from various countries, pure gold, and bullion, etc., the daily trading volume is dominated by bullion, while the rest are traded very little. Therefore, the Shanghai gold market is actually a bullion market.</p>
<p>The participants who gather at the Shanghai Gold Market every day for trading include Chinese banks, foreign banks, gold brokers, gold shops, money houses, cotton yarn groups, securities groups, importers and exporters, and scattered retail customers from the local area and from various other regions. As for the trading methods in the market, they can be divided into two types: spot trading and forward trading. Spot trading is settled on the same day; forward trading is limited to two months. In the past, during its heyday, the trading volume of bullion in the Shanghai Gold Exchange was quite large, with a monthly turnover of often three to four million taels. After the implementation of the new currency policy in 1935, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the speculation in bullion in the market greatly decreased, with a sharp reduction in trading volume. The monthly turnover was only four to five thousand taels. After the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, business came to a standstill. However, since the implementation of foreign exchange control in China in early March 1938, speculators have once again used the fluctuations in the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange to manipulate the market. As a result, illegal cash transactions in the Shanghai black market have suddenly become active again. Although the government has recently promulgated laws to centralize the purchase of gold and prohibit private trading, the situation in Shanghai is special and has not been implemented. Illegal trading of bullion continues to exist.</p>
<p>II. Reasons for Gold Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>Bullion prices are closely related to foreign exchange rates and gold prices in the UK and the US. Although the US is not a gold standard country, there is still a relatively fixed relationship between the US dollar and gold. Therefore, the gold price calculated in US dollars is extremely stable. Before the outbreak of the German-Polish war, the gold price calculated in British pounds was also extremely stable. Recently, with the outbreak of the German-Polish war, the Bank of England abandoned maintaining the external value of the British pound, and the London gold price rose. Under the stable conditions of gold prices in the UK and the US, the fluctuations in Shanghai gold prices depend entirely on the tightness of foreign exchange in Shanghai: when foreign exchange is tight, gold prices rise, and vice versa. If gold prices in the UK and the US are unstable, then the changes in Shanghai gold prices closely follow the changes in gold prices in the UK and the US and the exchange rates in Shanghai, rising and falling in proportion. However, the degree of fluctuation always differs slightly from the changes in gold prices in the UK and the US and the exchange rates in Shanghai due to local supply and demand relationships. Furthermore, China currently prohibits the export of gold, and domestic gold cannot be exported and sold at high prices. Therefore, Shanghai gold prices are often lower than London gold prices. As for the parity between Shanghai bullion and London pure gold, the calculation method is as follows:</p>
<p>For example, on September 6, the price of British pure gold was £8 and 8 shillings, which is 2016 pence, and the black market exchange rate for British pounds in Shanghai was 4 pence and 3125/10000. The calculation of the Shanghai gold price is as follows:</p>
<p>III. Trends in Black Market Gold Prices</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Gold Exchange closed down after the "August 13th" incident, a black market soon emerged. However, gold transactions in the black market are limited to spot transactions. Since the implementation of foreign exchange control last March, the fluctuations in gold prices have become increasingly large due to the indefinite contraction and expansion of the black market for foreign exchange and the supply and demand relationship in the market. From the "August 13th" incident to March 14th of last year, before the implementation of foreign exchange control, Shanghai gold prices were extremely stable. The highest price for each tael (ten liang) of gold was no more than 1149 yuan, a very slight increase compared to before the war, and the trend was relatively moderate. However, since the government implemented foreign exchange control on March 14th of last year, the black market for foreign exchange has shrunk daily, and black market gold prices have gradually risen. By August of last year, the highest price for each tael of gold had risen to 2041 yuan, an increase of 896 yuan compared to 1145 yuan in the same period of the previous year.</p>
<p>Since last September, the promulgation of various regulations on the management of gold has further promoted the repeated rise in gold prices, with the highest rise reaching 2190 yuan. In June of this year, the Sino-British Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee stopped supplying foreign exchange to the Shanghai black market, the foreign exchange market shrank sharply, and gold prices rose sharply again, once reaching a record of nearly 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, the German-Polish war has led to the participation of Britain and France in the war, and another European war is about to begin. Because people have learned the lesson of the previous European war, where silver was expensive and gold was cheap, they have been selling their gold holdings, causing gold prices to fall daily. On September 4th, it fell to 3070 yuan, but recently, as foreign exchange has contracted again, gold prices have begun to rise again. The future trend will depend on foreign exchange rates and gold prices in the UK and the US.</p>
<h3>The Salary of Emperors</h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>In the world today, a person who is a king or emperor often has a salary that is less than that of a businessman, a banker, or even a movie star. Please see the following survey report on the salaries of emperors from various countries around the world:</p>
<p>King George VI of England has an annual salary of US$3 million, which is entirely allocated by the national treasury.</p>
<p>The Emperor of Japan has an annual salary of US$1.3 million, and in addition, he has an annual surplus of US$4 million from his own property.</p>
<p>The Queen of the Netherlands has an annual salary of $700,000. She is very frugal, and her daily living expenses are similar to those of a middle-class woman.</p>
<p>The King of Sweden has an annual salary of $200,000, which is exactly half the salary of US President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The Kings of Bulgaria and Greece have the lowest salaries. The King of Bulgaria has an annual salary of only $45,000. Although his salary is so low, he still has to maintain a large national museum and a library with his funds. The King of Greece has an annual salary of $25,000. He has to sell the grapes produced in his palace every year to maintain his daily expenses!</p>
<h3>A Statistic of the First World War</h3>
<p>— Ye Hong</p>
<p>The European war has broken out. Whether this will lead to a second world war is still difficult to say for sure. But a second world war is inevitable sooner or later. Here, let's introduce some of the shocking statistics of the first world war:</p>
<p>(1) Among the belligerent countries, the number of soldiers who participated in the war reached 65 million, which is 13 times the current total population of Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) The number of people who died as a result of the war was more than 10 million. The number of wounded who became permanently disabled reached as many as 24 million.</p>
<p>(3) The cost of the war was 120 billion marks, accounting for half of the total wealth accumulated by the hard and forced labor of many generations of all the people in Europe. If calculated according to the market price of HSBC's listing on September 2 of this year, then this cost is equivalent to more than 77 trillion 960 billion 70 million Chinese national currency: assuming that the number of people who bear this war cost is the same as the Chinese population, then each person would have to pay more than 16,400 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) From August 3, 1914, when France and Germany declared war, to November 11, 1918, when Germany and the Allied countries signed an armistice, the war lasted for four years, three months, and one week.</p>
<p>(5) A total of 19 countries participated in the war. There were 11 countries that declared war but did not fight. A total of 30 countries were caught in the whirlpool.</p>

<p>Anecdotes of Famous People</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax</h3>
<p>— Yi Yin</p>
<p>Closest Friend to Gandhi - Even During a Train Derailment, He Still Ate Scrambled Eggs with Ham</p>
<p>Lord Halifax is the Foreign Secretary of the globally dominant British Empire. He was born in 1881 and is now 59 years old. His father, Sir Lindley Wood, was a member of the gentry of Yorkshire and a devout religious man, who served as the president of the British Church Union for fifty years. Therefore, when Halifax was young, he was deeply influenced by his father. Soon after, he was sent to Eton College, but because of his laziness, he was often punished by his teachers. To this day, when asked about it, he still smiles and nods in agreement.</p>
<p>After graduating from Eton College, he entered Oxford University. This is the only shortcut to becoming a politician. At that time, he met Geoffrey Dawson, who is now the editor-in-chief of The Times, and became very good friends.</p>
<p>In 1908, at the age of 28, he married Miss Oslaw. In 1910, he was elected to Parliament. At that time, the other officials looked down on him and ridiculed him, but after not much time, because of his perseverance and wisdom, no one dared to despise him anymore.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War in 1914, he served as the commander of the Yorkshire Yeomanry. Later, after the end of the European War, he was appointed as the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. During his tenure, he was greatly appreciated by Baldwin. In 1922, during Baldwin's first cabinet, he served as the Minister of Education. Two years later, he was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture, and in 1926, he was again appointed as the Viceroy of India.</p>
<p>When this new position was announced, the British expatriates in Bombay prepared to give him a grand welcome, arranging dancing parties and concerts. But they waited and waited, and waited for a long time, but they did not see the Viceroy arrive. Later, it was discovered that he was quietly praying in a corner of a church in Bombay - something that no British Viceroy had ever done before. As soon as the prayer was over, regardless of people's anxiety and expectations, he ran straight to Gandhi's residence - this was something that a British Governor had never done before. After a short conversation, the two immediately became close friends, and to this day, they always address each other in their letters as "My Great Friend".</p>
<p>In 1931, he returned from India and was again appointed as the Minister of Education. After 1934, he also served as the Secretary of State for War and the Lord Privy Seal. In the recent Chamberlain cabinet, he was appointed as the Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p>He retains the typical nature of the British people - calmness. There is a story that still remains in people's minds: in 1929, during his tenure as the Viceroy of India, one day he had to take a train to Delhi because of some business. Unexpectedly, the train was sabotaged on the way and derailed. Everyone was terribly frightened, but he, on the other hand, did not move and peacefully ate his scrambled eggs with ham in the dining car. Therefore, the Speaker of the British House of Commons, O'Connor, often said: "Anyone who sees Halifax can know that he is an Englishman."</p>
<p>Like Baldwin and Gray, he also likes rural life. At the same time, he has also said that he would rather be a hunting manager than hope to be the Prime Minister. Every weekend, he always goes to his manor in Garrowby to stay for a day or two. He also likes to write. He has published a book about the ghost legends in his family's ancient castle.</p>
<p>He now has three sons, one daughter, and one grandson. His family is famous for longevity in Yorkshire. Halifax's grandfather lived to be eighty years old, Halifax's father lived to be ninety-five years old, and in Yorkshire, there is a very popular saying that "Halifax will be able to live ten years longer than his father." Therefore, Lord Halifax very much wants to exceed one hundred years old and enjoy the happiness of four, perhaps five generations under one roof.</p>
<h3>The Self-Preservation Techniques of Political Giants</h3>
<p>— She Xing</p>
<p>Hiring Decoys</p>
<p>In ancient times, many autocratic tyrants often hired several decoys to avoid being attacked by others, to act as scapegoats. Zhang Liang's assassination of the Qin Emperor, but hitting the "deputy car," is a clear proof of this. Today, those dictators have all taken Qin Shi Huang as their teacher. They do have many enemies, but they must also have a spirit of fearlessness and often appear in front of the masses, so the profession of "decoy" has emerged.</p>
<p>This kind of decoy must have a face that is as similar as possible to the dictator, the same body type, and must also imitate the employer's posture when sitting and his gait when walking. These decoys are paid very well. They often appear beside the dictator under the names of aides, secretaries, chauffeurs, etc. They live very secretly, and the masses will never know of their existence. Even after they are sniped or die, the secret is still strictly guarded.</p>
<p>One cold winter morning in Moscow, it was the annual grand review as usual. The stands next to Lenin's tomb were packed with people. A foreign reporter stood behind the stands near the tomb. At this time, a car drove from the Kremlin gate and stopped next to the tomb. A familiar face came out of the car, "Stalin!" Everyone cheered. But as all eyes were focused on him, the reporter glimpsed a team of tall men wearing cloaks, quickly walking straight towards the back of the tomb from another door. Walking in large strides in the tightly packed crowd, that was the real Stalin. After this group of people passed, the reporter was constantly watched by two men until the inspection was completed.</p>
<p>Hitler initially looked down on those who hired decoys. He often said: "The German people's love for me, as well as the Blackshirts, are enough to protect me." But once, when he was crossing an iron bridge by train, he was attacked, so he immediately hired a decoy. Hitler's first decoy was the chauffeur Hilek. He died after a year, reportedly from meningitis. But four weeks later, the truth gradually emerged: it turned out that one day when Hitler was driving from Berlin to Bernau, Hitler was the driver, and Hilek replaced the German leader in the car, pressing his forehead low with a pointed hat. As the car was traveling at an intersection, suddenly a bullet flew in, and the decoy in the car fell in response. The driver immediately accelerated to drive two miles, then stopped, got out of the car, removed his hat, and told the people around him that he was Hitler.</p>
<p>Mussolini was very reluctant to have others die for him. But in the six dangerous situations in his life, two people died for him, namely the murder of his chauffeur in 1923, and the death of the Grand Duke of Rome a few years later.</p>
<p>The bravest of the decoys was the decoy of former Japanese Prime Minister Okada. That was during the February 26th Tokyo coup in 1936, when a group of machine gunners broke through the gate of Prime Minister Okada's residence and entered the locked middle gate. They shouted loudly outside the door for Okada to come out and die. At first, there was no movement. Just as they were about to break down the door, the door suddenly opened, and an old, fat, wide-mouthed man was facing them, undoubtedly Okada. Immediately, a burst of machine-gun bullets pierced his body. A few days later, the rebels were suppressed, and the entire Tokyo mourned Okada's death. Suddenly, Okada appeared in the bowl cupboard of the Prime Minister's private residence, hungry and thin, but alive. This was another case of mistaken killing by another person!</p>
<h3>The Dawn of True Peace Has Arrived</h3>
<p>Scientific Trivia</p>
<h3>What You Wouldn't Expect</h3>
<p>— Xu Jiemei</p>
<p>Do you know that the most peculiar thing in the world is yourself? Although I am not a fortune teller, and I have never met you, I dare to bet you five to one that I can tell you many things about yourself that you have never thought of.</p>
<p>Don't think that white people have Western appearances. In fact, white people have more pigment in their skin than black people, and their eyes protrude more than those of yellow people. You think that human diet is the most regular, but in fact, human food contains the most grasses.</p>
<p>The blood vessels in the eyes flow much faster than the blood vessels in other parts of the body, so they can work very quickly, accurately, and continuously. But you should know that your visual organ is not the eyes. What the eyes see can never be more than what a camera takes. They are only stimulated by light, concentrating the light on a sensitive part, and then the brain converts these lights into illusions. So, the visual organ is not the eyes but the brain; similarly, photography is the work of the film, not the lens box. However, vision cannot only have the brain without the eyes, just like photography, it is useless to have only the film without the lens box.</p>
<p>You can actually observe that the left eye of a person who is used to using their left hand is always more sensitive than their right eye. The right eye of a person who is used to using their right hand must be more sensitive than their left eye; although this is not a theorem, it is a common situation.</p>
<p>Even if your eyes have no problems at all, when they move, you seem to be blind, unable to see anything. For example, when you are reading a book, you read line by line. You never see the lines of words alternating; what you see are just novel images.</p>
<p>When you read a book, looking at the words printed on the book, what you actually see is the blank space next to the words, because the reflectivity of the blank space is much stronger than the reflectivity of the black words. So, when you see the character "〇", what you see is not a black circle, but a white circle with some blurry shadows around it on a white background.</p>
<p>Didn't I just tell you that white people have more pigment in their skin than black people, and their eyes protrude more than those of yellow people? This is the truth. You should know that "white" is made up of a mixture of various pigments. The light reflected by either deep purple or bright red cannot match white. Black, on the other hand, does not reflect light at all, so black people actually have the lightest skin tone.</p>
<p>As for the eyes, don't think that protruding eyes are a characteristic of Easterners. In fact, protruding eyes are a characteristic of all kinds of people in the world other than Easterners. Originally, Easterners' eyes are a little protruding, which is because their noses are too low. To be honest, their eyes are not as protruding as those of Westerners or Cossacks!</p>
<h3>Notes on Small Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Zhou Daming</p>
<p>A type of anteater in the southwestern United States always produces four offspring each time, no more, no less, and all four are of the same sex.</p>
<p>Color blindness, scurvy, and baldness can be passed on to future generations. Syphilis can also affect future generations, but it can only be called "inherited infection," not "heredity."</p>
<p>The so-called murder weapon - death ray - according to Marconi, the inventor of radio, the recent achievement is only killing a mouse within three feet.</p>
<p>There is a redwood tree in San Francisco, USA, which is said to be more than 5,000 years old. It is the longest-lived tree in the world, and the tree still exists today.</p>
<p>All three-year-old girls have 400,000 immature eggs in their ovaries. This number decreases to about 35,000 to 6,000 by the age of eight, and to 400 by the age of thirteen or fourteen, during puberty. Among these, only about 200 eggs have the hope of being fertilized.</p>
<p>Many of the stones on Qizi Mountain in Suzhou have traces of sponges. According to geologists, it is believed that the mountain was previously at the bottom of the sea, so there are traces of sponge fossils.</p>
<p>When a dog falls asleep, it must keep its tail close to its body, otherwise it cannot sleep soundly.</p>
<h3>Random Eye Talk</h3>

<p>An amoeba (a lower protozoan with only one cell) has an eye as big as its stomach and is extremely sensitive to light.</p>
<p>A jellyfish has a rough eye socket that helps it distinguish between light and dark.</p>
<p>A starfish's eyes are on its arms.</p>
<p>A snail's eyes are on its horns.</p>
<p>An octopus's eyes are like human eyes.</p>
<p>The eyes of ordinary fish are structurally similar to those of humans.</p>
<p>An eagle's eyes are pear-shaped, suitable for long-distance observation.</p>
<p>Rabbit eyes are good at sensing moving objects.</p>
<p>Smoking is not particularly harmful to the eyes, but if the whole body is poisoned by the nicotine in the smoke, the eyes are also affected.</p>
<p>Roel Bacon was the first to know that glass can refract light.</p>
<h3>Stars, Cards, Songs: A Perfect Combination</h3>
