<p>（倫敦）張伯倫首相頃於本日午後、在下議院發表宣言稱、「余今日復得說明本國外交政策之機會、殊爲欣幸、英國政府素有一貫之政策、卽在各國之間發生爭議時、主張經由自由談判方式予以調整、並認爲乃此處理爭議之自然的正當的辦法、且在英國政府視之、世界之上、決無一項問題、不能用和平方式予以解決、倘有以武力或以武力的威脅、代替談判方式、吾人實未見其理由何在、至以現行局勢而論、政府正與其他各國政府相諮詢、想必下議院諸君、俱已知之、至現在爲止、各關係國交換意見、尙未竣事、但爲充分說明英國政府立塲起見、特向下議院諸君鄭重聲明、倘遇任何舉動、足以威脅波蘭國之獨立主權、而由該國認爲必須以全國力量從事抵抗時、英國政府當立卽以全力援助之、英國政府業本此旨、向波蘭政府提供保證、並由法國政府授權于余、代爲聲明、該國實與英國抱有同樣態度、惟是、外傳某某國擬向波蘭進攻之說、英國政府迄今未獲正式報吿、足資瞪實、自未便認爲確有其事、」至是、首相又答復某議員詢問云、「余意頃所聲明各節、業已十分明白、但尙須補充聲明者、凡此所言、專爲各關係國在交換意見竣事以前之過渡時期而發、」此之所謂各關係國、蘇聯亦在其內、哈里法克斯外相曾於今晨與該國大使邁斯基談話甚久、「英國政府此次舉動所依據之原則、已爲蘇聯政將所完全了解、且加以贊許、」此外、尙有一點須加聲明者、卽波蘭外長柏克上校將於下星期之內、前來倫敦、（各議員鼓掌、）頃者、格林伍德君曾以促成最大限度之合作爲言、余意亦然、一俟柏克外長抵此之後、吾人卽可與之進行談話、討論各項辦法、藉以樹立最大限度之合作、以防止侵略、並謀更合理的談判方式之實現、以代替武力、」張伯倫首相旋又答覆某議員詢問云、「政府此次舉措、業已隨時通知各自治領、余且毫不遲疑敢提保證、英國與蘇聯在思想上幷無齟齬之處」云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）首相於下午二時五十分入院、衆皆歡呼以迎之、張伯倫首相曰、下院已知英政府現正與其他政府作某種協商、爲使英政府之立塲、在此項協商結束以前爲人透澈明瞭起見、余今特吿知下院、在協商期內、萬一有何行動、明白危害波蘭之獨立、波蘭政府認爲要當以全國武力抵抗者、則英政府自覺義不容辭、當卽以其權力所能爲之一切、援助波蘭、英政府已以此項保瞪給予波蘭政府矣、渠所發之言、擬包括英政府與其他政府進行協商之際之期間、波蘭外長柏克之來倫敦、可獲討論各種計畫之機會、而使終止侵略之任何合作努力得臻至高之度、並以更合理更有次序之討論方法、代目前之協商、今日下午在下院發表重要主張與補充之問答、佔時僅十七分鐘、於是下院卽宣布延會至四月三日、（三十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）首相張伯倫今日下午在下院明白聲言、英國對他國在歐洲續事侵略時、決不作壁上觀、英政府之作此決議、乃內閣及昨日英·法·波蘭·羅馬尼亞四國政府相互貫澈討論之結果、所商妥之詳細辦法、當局雖仍守秘密、但其特點爲向波羅兩國提出建議、擴張彼等之互助協定、而將爲德所攻一事包括在內、聞波蘭於昨日深夜作費、接受此項建議、羅馬尼亞之接受、自無疑義、英法兩國後乃決議、如波羅兩國中今後有一爲德國侵略之對象、則英法準備出而助之、四國首都間之談判、所以突然加速進行者、多由德國方面傳來令人不安之軍事計劃消息、有以致之、蓋四國當軸接此驚訊、皆覺若待波蘭外長柏克於四月三日行抵倫敦、再行討論、則恐冒不及決定抵抗侵路的立塲之巨險也、（三十一日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英內閣今日突然召集會議、頗引起一般人之驚異、據路透國會訪員聲稱、此項會議中對於有關波蘭之情報、曾加以特殊之撿討、衆信此項閣議、係昨晚所決定、並預料今日閣議中所考慮關於波蘭之情報、未必能證明其爲最後之斷論、衆望波蘭外長柏克下週之來倫敦、或可澄淸目前之情形、同時聞各閣員對於所提議之反侵略宣言問題、意見一致、態度堅决、據路透訪員聲稱、此項宜言之發表、如有任何展緩、則其主要原因、必係與法國作密切商討之故、蓋此項宣言最後定稿未發表前、必需有此一舉也、又觀於今日下院開會時、反對黨方面未提出任何質問、可見國會中意見巳趨於堅强、此種情形、今晚已頗明顯矣、路透訪員復力言、各政黨皆願政府儘早發表宣言、無有欲妨礙政府之工作者、今日閣議完畢後、與外交事務最有密切關係之谷閣員、均未散去、以便繼續討論、今日閣議之內容、現在嚴守秘密、惟聞政府仍決心維持並發展其努力、以防止繼續侵略、據路透國會訪員聲稱、在過去四十八小時之內、政府方面之意見、已顯趨堅强、其故多因海外傳來之情報、有以促成之、閣議情形之嚴守秘密、巳引起許多流言、謂政府或將採取某某行動云、惟此類消息、祗能認其爲揣測之詞、同時各國京城間之商議、尤其爲倫敦與巴黎兩方面、現正在進行中、波蘭駐英大使勒秦斯基今日曾訪問英外部、並於閣議散會後、在外部有所會商、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨相府倏召集內閣特別會議、八時三刻卽已開議、時間之早、爲向來所未有、首相張伯倫·外相哈立法克斯·財相西門·國防調整大臣迦特斐爾德·自治領大臣殷斯基浦·與海相史丹萊皆列席、歷一時一刻始散、衆信閣員對於首相今日午後將在下院發表之言論、曾加以討論、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英內閣決定、如波蘭羅馬尼亞遭受外國攻擊、英國決加援助、此項決定、表示英國外交政策、已進入新階段、關係各國京城之談判、現亦賡續進行中、法國及波蘭對於英國保障公約計劃之覆文、英國接獲後、已經通知莫斯科、並與之繼續談判、羅馬尼亞波蘭兩國、現亦正與英國談判中、其程度顯較一般所知者爲深云、（三十一日海通社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國已在波麥拉尼省、尤其是在奧特河沿岸佛朗克孚城一帶、集中軍隊、波蘭與德國邊界形勢、因而異常緊張、此訊傳至倫敦之後、英國政府極爲焦念、最後消息雖謂德軍兩師業自波國邊界附近調往他處、但此間不安之念、仍未消釋、內閣爰於本日午後開會、討論此事、內閣外交委員會亦於午後舉行會議、據可靠消息、張伯倫首相業已決定於明日午前在下議院發出聲明、謂波國倘被德國侵略、則英法兩國當立即出而援助、政界人士頃加以評論云、英法兩國雖允援助波蘭、但德波兩國關於但澤自由市、暨在德國波麥拉尼東普魯士兩省之問、建造公路、橫貫波蘭走廊兩項問題、仍有成立友好解決方案之可能云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據外交界與其他各界消息、美政府認爲最近將來、歐洲大致將緊張如故、並信獨裁國有以「另一慕尼黑」强制於民治國之意、故美國下週決寬弛中立法、希望藉此助成「不屈服的和平」、（三十日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）路透社自消息靈通方面探悉、德國向波蘭提出要求、甚至謂已發哀的美敦　書等謠言、確屬張大其詞、當局並不否認德國巳向波蘭提出某種建議、但請華沙加入反　共公約一節、聞傳之似屬過早、即建築汽車路通過「波蘭游廊」一端、德國亦未向波蘭促迫、據謂、此路工程艱鉅、需費浩大、異日落成、且將予走私者以絕佳之機會云、德宣傳部長戈培爾現與希特勒同駐巴伐利亞、航空部長戈林現居義國、經濟部長芬克現正忙於德意志銀　行之事務、故內閣似不致在此舉行　要或秘密會議、各報仍未　稍露當局關於波蘭問題之意見或志願路透社又悉、波蘭外長　柏克下週由華沙乘火車赴倫敦時、中途不致下車、（三十日路透電）</p>

<p>上月二十六日，意相墨索里尼在法西斯黨廿週紀念會上發表演說，對法國提出關於突尼斯，蘇彝士和吉布蒂的權利要求。當時，墨索里尼的態度雖比較和緩，但他的代言人蓋達却在羅馬倫敦的報紙上發表論文，除對這三項要求加以說明外，又說，法國倘不予以適當的解決，則法意關係將永無修好的一日。言下頗有對法國威脅之意。</p>
<p>因此法國總理達拉第，於二十九日廣播演說，謂法國願意依據一九三五年的法意羅馬協定，從事談判。但法國決不放棄尺寸土地，亦不放棄絲毫權利。我們知道羅馬協定早給墨索里尼所片面廢棄，今法國旣不願於這協定之外，再放棄一些土地和權利；就難免使墨索里尼失望。</p>
<p>羅馬協定本是法意改善邦交，安定歐局的先聲。在羅馬協定以前，她們爲着爭取多瑙河流域的霸權，爲着爭取菲洲的殖民地，一向是在對立的，鬥爭的地位。一九三三年希特勒登台以後，竭力向多瑙河流域擴張勢力，法意二國因爲同受威脅，才變更以往的政策，於一九三五年一月締結羅馬協定。這協定規定法國應把意領利比亞以南，到梯比斯蒂（Tibesti）舊火山間的一帶土地和法領索謀利蘭塔佐拉（Tajura）灣以北，昆連意領伊里特里亞的一塊土地讓予意國。意國有了這一塊土地，就可以把她的勢力伸張到巴勒·伊·孟台勃（Bab　el　Mandab），和據有亞丁灣的英國同樣扼住紅海南端的門戶。其次，法國還把自吉布蒂通到阿比西尼亞首都的鐵路股票，一部讓給意國，使她也有經營該路的權利。此外，法國又允許在法屬突尼斯的意人可保持他們的國籍到一九四五年止。這就是說突尼斯的意人，要到一九四五年以後出生的才受法國法律的管轄。法國將這許多菲洲的利益給予意國，滿足她在菲洲的殖民地慾望，其目的無非欲使意國放棄其在多瑙河流域與法國爭霸的雄心，而共謀阻止希特勒的南進。可是事實上墨索里尼不但未能聯法以制德，反而勾結德國從事侵略。他帮助了希特勒兼併奧捷兩國，又積極主持西班牙的內戰。他旣把志願兵開入馬德里，控制整個西班牙的心臟，威脅着英國的直布陀羅；更屯重兵於比利牛斯山下，威脅着法國的西南部。但在另一方面，墨索里尼眼見德國於兼併奧捷之後，她的勢力大有伸入亞得利亞海，威脅與意國「生存攸關」的地中海北部的可能。德國勢力的過份膨賬對意國却也是不利的。所以她爲了增强在地中海南部與東部的勢力又向法國提出這些要求。</p>
<p>過去法國對於侵略國的要求，總是跟隨英國，採取因循優容的態度的。可是優容的結果，却反而助長了侵略者的野心。這次意大利的要求，就直接威脅着法國的生命綫。因爲第一，突尼斯在法屬北菲，位於意屬西西里和薩地尼亞兩島的對岸，是一個很重要的軍事地帶，倘爲意大利所佔有，控制了地中海的中部，則法屬阿爾日爾和摩洛哥，便感受威脅。第二，蘇彝士運河是地中海到紅海的要道，意大利如取得管理權，就可增强她在地中海西部的力量。第三，吉布蒂是紅海南端的一個要塞，隔海與亞丁港相望。義大利如在那兒的權力增强，就可以控制紅海和近東的交通。總之意國提出這三個要求，目的是在控制法國和菲洲及近東的交通。法國殖民地的廣大，僅次於英國，而殖民地的大部份，又都位在菲洲。與殖民地的交通，一旦受人控制，則與放棄其全部殖民地又有何異？</p>
<p>法國因對侵略者因循優容而受到的敎訓與欺紿已很多了。本來早應該有所覺悟，現在達拉第於表示不放棄尺寸土地，不放棄絲毫權利之外，又籲請愛好和平的國家加緊合作，以制止侵略者未來的侵略。這自是必要的。但我們希望法國的態度能夠更加積極起來，採取更有效的方法以制裁侵略者。</p>

<p>晋省某地　吾儕深夜跨疲乏之馬、而入日軍兩度侵入卒被迫放棄之晋省祈縣、翌日淸晨、縣長正式訪會吾儕、其人年四十許、狀殊精幹、其筆記簿載有關於該城經歷之詳情、錄其大略如下、</p>
<p>日軍知本城爲晋省重要中心地、年餘前曾越山侵入、居民事前將一切食物與貴重物品、遷運一空、而後棄城他適、此在晋省乃屬常有之事、然本城因日軍損毀、仍損失達十五萬元、房屋被焚燬者頗夥、城中不及舁走之受傷華軍約四百人、遭日軍用槍刺刺斃、後經游擊隊攻擊約十日、日軍乃向鐵路退去、迨華軍入城　始悉前受傷兵士、早被日軍慘殺矣、</p>
<p>去幾十二月、本城二次被攻、居民取同樣之防預辦法、先將城中食物移出、並將其他物件埋置地下、第二次損失達二十萬元、日軍計二萬人、分三路進犯、華軍未作堅强抵抗、面任日軍佔據之、但華軍繞至日軍後方而截斷其路錢、日軍侵佔期內、搜羅牲畜九百頭、用以飽啖、並有八十七人慘遭日軍擊斃、內有農民七十一人、餘爲當地公務人員、</p>
<p>該縣長旋述及勇毅事蹟一則、謂離城一哩處、有須用練梯始能得達險峻山顚、居有九戶、彼等見日軍臨前索食、即將練梯收起、日軍如圖攀登懸崖、彼等即向之擲下石塊與傢具、日軍數名因是而死、經四日之抵抗後、卒爲日軍攀登、居民悉遭屠殺、殞命者約三十人、餘生者僅幼童四人、其二人受傷、另二佯死得脫、旋日軍被迫放棄祈縣、而於仲冬開始越山撒退云云、縣長陳述一切後、由華軍高級軍官證實、蓋日軍交通被切斷、食糧日缺、不得不撤退也、華軍乃乘機扼守山隘、攻擊日軍、日軍因彈藥糧秣兩缺、乃於沿途掙扎逃竄、</p>
<p>該縣長末稱、據華方報吿、日軍傷亡四分之一、內有高級軍官數名、共計五千人之多云、吾儕復首途之前、曾至祈縣各街散步、該縣爲一典型中國小縣、城位於兩山間之狹谷、房屋被燬者約五分之一、但城中農民熙攘往來、貿易頗盛、時見驢馬馱貨單行成列、行經鋪卵石之狹街而進、沿途頗多露天小攤、每攤之前、輒圍集多人、此種小攤、大都設於刦後之　瓦礫塲上、出售之貨物種類繁多、各人似皆抱照常營業之目的、</p>
<p>該縣長復語路透訪員云、如日軍復來、吾人將照前行事、而留空城、切斷彼等之交通、以待其不得不撤退、縣政府則將移至距城數哩外之山中辦公、俟日軍旣去、吾儕將復遷回城中云、（三月十四日路透特派員發）</p>

<p>— 項英</p>
<p>第二時期，本軍進入以後，日本帝國主義大肆活動，一，是到處用飛機散發傳單，說紅軍打土豪是共產黨，企圖造成階級糾紛，使羣衆與我們關係不能聯繫，破壞我們團結，但由於我們軍隊進入此地區以後，用我們的行動，用我們的戰鬭，證明我們軍隊紀律好，是維護人民利益的，使日寇的宣傳失却效用。其次是用威力鎭壓老百姓使之不與我們接近，否則就用大砲亂轟，燒房子，使民衆呌新四軍不要去，免得燒房子，但是後來我們沒有到的地方，仍然是一樣的燒一樣的殺，老百姓漸漸感覺到日寇的宣傳是欺騙他們的。三，是政治宣傳，敵人用反共。反蔣爲口實，對民衆說你們受戰爭災害是因爲共產黨與蔣介石，你們耍求得和平，只有反對共產黨反對蔣介石。敵人的中心口號是反對中國抗戰的主要力量。這就是說我們軍隊進入以後，他們以前的辦法沒有用了。四，是採取溫柔政策，敵人把他們最野蠻的行動也收束起來，施點小惠，使民衆不與我們接近。</p>
<p>第三時期，即最近動態，一，收服認識不足的，成分不好的，動搖的地方武裝來變叛。二，威脅兩面派站在它那一邊，做它統治的忠實工具。三，利用漢奸到處分化。四，勾結地方動搖分子，不僅與他們通消息，並屬於他的勢力範圍。五，對於積極進攻的軍隊互相默契，採取互不侵犯的態度。六，推行反共運動，如最近在南京·蕪湖開的反共運動大會。七，敵人最近利用中國資源使各工廠進行生產，在南京·常州·無錫等地，由日人出面開設工廠，准許那些民族意識薄弱的資本家開工廠，做生意，求日經濟合作，在這些地方正在實行着日貨的傾銷，這樣一方面在開發中國資源，一方面利用中國資源，來進行中日的戰爭，敵人在政治上正向這方面進攻，一年來敵人在軍事上·政治上有了不同，有了變化。</p>
<p>第二，我們軍事·政治情况變化：一，六月以前，江南地區僞組織維持會是普遍的存在，中國的政權是很少，很少。二，兩面派充滿各地，佔主要地位。三，江南民衆情緒消沉。四，抗戰以來土匪普遍地皆是，到處橫行。五，大刀會由於日本的撲殺，游擊隊的横暴，乃造成種種阻礙。六，游擊隊紀律很壞，拼命的自己打自己，爭奪地盤。正因爲自己打自己，所以便沒有力量打日本了。這是六月以前的情况。二，我們軍隊進入以後，幾個月中戰鬭的結果，工作的結果是一，除了敵人據點以內的，僞政權是普遍的取銷了，中國的政權是普遍的建立恢復起來了。二，兩面派銷聲匿跡了。三，壞的武裝部隊有的解散了，有的改編了。四，爭取大刀會配合作戰。五，民衆組織，一般說相當建立起來了。六，民衆抗戰情緖已大大的提高了，這是本軍進入江南地區以後的變化。三，將來的趨勢，江南的鬭爭形勢是一天天緊張，鬭爭是一天天尖銳，我們估計到江南今後的情勢，將有更深入的發展，在國爭更激烈，更艱苦的情形下，若沒有廣大羣衆組織的開展，少數動搖分子部分的分化是必然的，不僅軍民要合作，而且要軍政一致，爲了適應江南將來更艱苦的狀况，這是必要的，不過目前的情况，軍·政還是分離的，而且是背道而馳，這與將來的發展不適台，而應當急於要改正的。</p>
<p>敵人軍事上優點和弱點</p>
<p>根據一年來的作戰，敵人的優點與弱點可分下列幾點：第一，敵人的戰術，一，敵人的戰術是依靠到處構築據點，修築公路，縮小我們的活動的範圍。二，分進合擊，採取襲擊包圍。三，輕裝掩進，便於迅速動作，突然襲擊。四，採用伏擊，利用道路伏擊我部隊。五，採取隱蔽的行動，白天容易發覺，夜間行動，使我警戒疏忽，部隊易受打擊。它走小路，不走大路。六，依靠火力，用火力威脅敵人，壓制敵人。第二，敵人的優點：一，射擊準確。二，善於利用地形，地物，隱蔽前進。三，會游泳，四，傷病兵的救護迅速，軍火的收拾機敏。五，頑强性由於武士道的敎育，軍閥的武斷，欺騙，宣傳養成了敵軍戰鬥的頑强性，以前寗可打死，不願繳槍，現在程度降低了，不如以前那般頑強。六，每種動作合於戰術，合於戰鬥的要求。七，幹部很强，能掌握部隊，遇戰鬥展開很快。八，士兵服從性强，說進就進，說退就退，打敗了能集合。九，對於交通修復力很强。十，戰術運用很靈活，隨時的變動，今天失敗，明天就改了。第三，對福我們的計策：一，所有重要交通綫，以及公路轉灣抹角處，都構築工事做據點。二，做鐵絲網，用警犬，小河用活動橋樑。四，行軍或運輸，用小兵力先佔據顯耍地位，掩蔽前進，搜索前進。五，宿營地點常常變動。六，住的房子挖戰壕槍洞。七，利用河道運輸，防我襲擊。第四，敵人的弱點：一，輕敵心仍然存在，警戒疏忽。二，缺乏攻擊精神。三，動作呆笨遲鈍。四，不能耐勞，不能長途行軍。急行軍，强行軍。五，利用漢奸的失敗，與僞軍的無用，和不可靠。</p>
<p>民運工作的經驗與敎訓</p>
<p>我們在這一年來，在前方在後方，爲了動員民衆，加强抗戰的力量，爲了達到軍民的合作，以及在民衆的喲過戶與帮助之下，能够在江南苦難的環境下面，來堅持鬥爭，所以自從本軍成立以來，隨時隨地的進行民衆運動，雖然我們因爲各種客觀條件，使我們在某一個時候，某一個階段中間，不能依照我們自己的願望，進行民衆工作，甚至不能做民衆工作，醫如本軍成立開始，由改編到集中，特別是在集中這一階段，我們爲了遵守上級的命令，爲了免除許多誤會，在這個時間，可以說是沒有做民衆工作，直到我們部隊展開以後，進行作戰時，才在我們自已作戰的區域，我們自己軍隊的周圍，開始進行民運工作，我們以前的宣傳工作，是作得很少，在這時間才開始進行，不僅宣傳，並且由宣傳進到組織，可是直到今天，還有一部份人不了解民衆工作的重要，還不了解如何達到軍民的合作，這樣不僅不能開展表面的民衆運動，達到救亡運動的開展，甚至於不願有民衆運動，和妒嫉人家作民衆運動。我們爲什麼要做民運工作呢？爲了抗戰，爲了可以戰勝敵人，消滅敵人，爭取抗戰的勝利，站在軍隊的本身來說，爲了軍隊的生存，沒有民衆，軍隊不能開展，不能生長，要打敗仗，允共在中日戰爭條件對比之下，我們的武器比較敵人差得多，拿我們新四軍來講，比一般抗戰軍隊武器還要差，我們拿這樣劣等的武器，對抗優等的敵人，主要依靠民衆的力量，和帮助，如果沒有民衆，那末我們不但不能够抵抗敵人，並且不能取得優劣懸殊情况下的作戰的勝利，這說明我們爲什麼要作民衆工作，爲什麼我們把這個工作和我們的生存與勝利，看得這樣重要，因爲道是不可分離的，半年多以來我們的民衆運動，可以分爲三個部份來講：</p>
<p>一，半年來的經騐與敎訓：A第一個經騐，也可說是一個敎訓，軍隊的本身的實際行動，它是得到民衆信仰與擁護的，基本條件，它是開始民運工作的基礎，我記得當本軍從南昌出發的時候，我曾經向服務團同志作一個關於戰區民運工作的報吿，我曾經指出第一以軍隊的本身行動作民衆運動的基礎，因爲我們是軍隊做民運工作，首先就要自己的紀律嚴明，才能取得民衆的信仰，我們想我們這一年，尤其是下半年來，更可證明這一點，譬如說，在上半年本軍集中後，向戰區開進的時候，我們沒有作宣傳工作，工作開始還是服務團同志到了戰爭環境展開以後，但爲什麽到處的許多民衆，他們對我們歡迎，信仰，許多民衆對我們帮助，使本軍在皖南民衆中間，得到極好極好的信仰，因爲我們軍隊有極好的紀律，不但紀律好，而且到處愛護民衆，到處尊重民衆的利益，因此雖然我們沒有許多宣傳，而我們到處受歡迎，當我們軍隊開始到江南作戰地區的時候，因爲日本軍隊的宣傳及過去國內戰爭時的宣傳，許多人對我們不了解，但我們的先遣隊去了一轉，馬上江南民衆對我們認識了，等到主力開進的時候，民衆到處歡迎我們，這些事實證明了這一眞理，軍隊紀律是民運工作的基礎，同樣的反過來證明那一個軍隊紀律不好，雖然做了許多宣傳，老百姓仍然不相信，許多人以爲我們不知道化了多少錢作宣傳工作，眞正的宣傳工作我們覺得慚愧得很，正因爲我們軍隊的行動才能取得民衆的信仰，這樣再去做民運工作，就便利得多了。B第二，作戰的勝利是開展民運工作必要的條件，單憑作宣傳不去打仗，或打仗不好，老百姓說『好是好的呀，沒有用呀！』簡單一句話，我們所以在江南取得廣大民衆的擁護，很快的開展民運工作，和我們在江南的勝利有很大的關係，這是第二個經騐與敎訓。C第三，統一戰綫是進行民運工作的前提，我在上一次報吿中特別指出一切經過統一戰綫，在統一戰錢基礎上，才能把民衆動員起來，今天我們也可證明那一個統一戰綫運用的好，就能大大的開展工作，那個地方差一點，工作也就差一點。D深入民衆，爲動員民衆和組織民衆的有效方法，要去組織，動員單靠宣傳不行，標語也不行，這些作用是很有限度的，一定要到民衆裏來去，才能了解民衆，才能接近民衆，才能在這個基礎上把他們組織起來，動員起來，一味站在民衆上面，想做民衆工作那是空的，這一個可以拿我們的經騐來看，前後方那些地方，沒有深入到民衆中去，工作就還不够，羣衆的動員就做不通，這是第四個經騐與敎訓。E，第五，要注意民衆的生活，這是動員民衆抗戰的主要條件，也可以說是必要的因素，要使廣大的民衆參加到抗戰中來，必須注意他們的生活問題，不想法子去解決他們的生活問題，那麼就不能將他們的熱情提高，因爲這是他們切身感覺的，我們拿經騐來看，那個地方注意了這個問題，並給以相富的解決，那個地方的抗戰情緖就不同，那個地方沒有顧到這個問題，民衆運動就差多了，不僅在前方，在後方也是一樣的，但我們有一個原則，在抗戰最高原則下面，來進行解決民生問題，爲抗戰來發動民衆來達到使他們參加抗戰，站在抗戰利益下去解決民生痛苦，這是一個原則，這也是我們半年多以來民運工作第五個經騐與敎訓。F無論任何民衆運動從開始發動繼續發展深入，民衆組織的鞏固，如果不能在當地民衆中間提拔許多幹部，培養幹部領導工作，這一民衆運動就不能開展，民衆組織，就不鞏固，只有提拔和培養了當地民衆中間的幹部，使這些器部去鞏固和堅强民衆組織，沒有這些骨幹是不成的，那地方有相當地幹部，有自己本身幹部工作，民衆運動一定好，那個地方經常請別人替他辦理是沒有大效果的，這是明顯的事實，G第七就是我們在方法上的一個經騐與敎訓，關於戲劇與化裝講演，這是農村宣傳量有效的方法，假若我們有很好的適合農村的戲劇，來提高他們抗戰的意識，比我們講很多的報吿效用還大，一般的民衆沒有進到學校，所以要注意他們了解的程度，採取各種各樣的方法，如果像我們今天的報吿，農民一聽，腦子就昏了，我們說在鬥爭以來經騐的方式，在農村中那些是有效的，可以說演講標語都沒有多大的效果，甚至於有藝術的圖畫也沒有十分作用，如果是化裝演講，演戲那就不同了。H第八，民運工作與民衆的動員，我們來分析一下，那些地方有民運工作，民衆的動員就容易，那些地方就可以適應抗戰的需要，减少動員的困難，凡有民衆組織的地方，動員就更快，沒有組織的羣衆，則政治認識不够，動員力量是小的，總之，這就是抗戰中很大的弱點，爲什麼民衆動員不起來呢？就是沒有組織，所以我們要做民運工作，要組織民衆，要依靠民衆組織才可以適合抗戰的要求。（未完）</p>

<p>上海「巴士德　研究院及法租界衛生處、對於去年防疫運動所得之結果、曾加以調查、茲將其去年十一月向遠東熱帶病翳學會在河內開大會時所提出報吿之結論、摘譯如下、</p>
<p>（一）在此百萬人口以上之都市內、當霍亂最猖獗時、患虧病者、從未超過世界公認之平均數、蓋去年霍亂流行最盛、每日息病之平均數、幷未超過四十一起故也、以每千人計之患病之指數、僅爲二至三、而死亡指數爲零二至零三、</p>
<p>（二）對於羣衆曾施以一次之注射、至於少數人依照醫學上適當方法、於十天內受兩次注射者、其患病指數幾等於零、</p>
<p>（三）曾經受防疫注射、而不幸仍患霍亂病者、其病勢之危險、大見减輕、其死亡率較未受注射者、减少三四倍之多、</p>
<p>故上海所得之結果、足證以前觀察之不誤、茲舉例如下、</p>
<p>當一九一六歐洲大戰、羅馬尼亞軍隊再渡多瑙河時、受避難羣衆傳染霍亂病、立即施行防疫注射、其醫生剛達居森曾有下列之記載、</p>
<p>防疫注射結果良好、由多普羅柴地方避難者傳播之霍亂危險、在數天內完全撲滅、嗣後數星期中、在慕爾達物城、雖仍有患斯病者、但將病人隔離及當地民衆施以集團防疫注射、該霍亂病立即消滅、</p>
<p>法租界衛生處擬於今年施以同樣之集團注射、如居民能通力合作、則其目的定能達到、故欲預防霍亂、須加注意、</p>

<p>久客滬濱上，</p>
<p>衣食時相煎；</p>
<p>靑春行將逝；</p>
<p>精力逐年衰。</p>
<p>妻貌如花美，</p>
<p>遠別不相親，</p>
<p>今服補體康，</p>
<p>情深自可留！</p>
<p>聲明：詩文混合之廣告爲木行首創</p>
<p>見以前『春閨情怨』</p>
<p>據日常經騐，知人身精力之消耗，的有兩大的主要原因，一爲自凟與荒淫，即過任繁雜的工作故也。前者爲不知自愛的靑年常陷之惡習，後係刻苦砥礪靑年者所難免。蓋吾人居此生活程度最高的孤島，感於生活的壓迫，經濟之恐慌，又不得不努力奮鬥，以解決其生活問題，因心神之太勞，神經漸决轉爲衰弱，由此造成神經衰弱之症者，比比皆然。</p>
<p>神經袞弱之後，遺精難免，過頻而久，其衰弱之範圍，漸决擴及於性機能，於是早洩而腎虧，靑春之樂，隨而喪失殆盡矣！</p>
<p>欲澈底了解性機能衰弱之起原，則前節之自凟與荒淫，亦同樣爲造成本症的主要病因，共原理亦與担任過勞的工作同一比率。蓋性機能的作用，旣不能曠，又不能縱，曠與縱雖同一有弊，然其害以縱爲允大也。是故縱慾之後，其靑春腺大爲不振，床第之歡，難生情愛，性情不覇的女子，則勢必與夫離異，寂寞悲慘的生活，自覺乏味。故爲求幸福計，自以早治爲是。倘不遵醫師之指導，濫服市上之春藥，及類如春藥的『補劑』，不僅絕無功效，且反有增病變，惟進以德國眞正雄壯動物睪丸精質製劑男用『袖體康』後，經過極短時期，就可使精力振作，性能昂盛，新陳代謝之機能促進，凡失眠健忘，腰酸背痛，食慾不振，早洩遺精，陰痿不姙等症，頃刻治愈，平時感覺神經衰弱者，此後即更一精力充沛之人。夫婦愛情淡薄者，亦必和好如初，此『補體康』所以備受醫藥兩界的推崇，遠非劣藥所可與之比擬。其女用『袖體康』功能促進乳房之發育，調經種子，功效如神。　俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>

<h3 id="c113">德義軸心的裂痕 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>要說德義軸心就要折斷，當然還嫌太早，但是我說德義軸心的已經有裂痕，却為不可掩的事實。我們不妨把近來所發生的幾件事，來證明這裂痕的存在：</p>
<p>德國併吞捷克，義大利沒有賀電，此其一。德國向南斯拉夫要求商業上的權利，墨索里尼的演說中却設義大利在亞德里亞海有控制權，此其二。義對法要求，德雖然自吿奮勇，願爲後盾，義却不再提出尼斯，薩伏亞，以及科西嘉的割讓要求，而只提出直布底港口和蘇彜士運河的交通問題，以及都尼西亞的義人待遇問題，此其三。……</p>
<p>此外則德併奧，德義壤土相接，使義感受威脅；德獨佔羅馬尼亞的經濟利益，擯義於門外；……凡此種種，也可以看出：德之威勢，不可一世，義則侷促一隅，望塵莫及。義之向外發展，力爭上游，固然是應有之事，然而說她沒有和德爭雄的心思，甘願雌伏在德的脚邊，也不見得吧。</p>
<p>這還是說的現在；如果希特勒的善於算舊帳，果然算得正確無誤，他一定還能够算出這兩件事：一，在歐戰時，義大利本來是德奧的同盟國，後來半途上竟加入了協的國，削弱了同盟國的勢力，使德奧速於潰敗；二，歐戰結束時，義大利併吞了若干處奧國的地方，一直到現在，這些地方上還有幾十萬的日耳曼人。希特勒假使在算舊帳的興趣下，再來算算這兩筆，其結果將爲怎樣呢？義大利在前會背棄同盟，在現在，在不久的將來，又怎麼保得定不背棄軸心，而加入民治陣綫呢？</p>
<p>舊的裂痕很深刻，新的裂痕遺在續續發生着，這軸心所以還能够維持下去的，不過彼此還有一些要利用對方的意思罷了。假使說只有一方面的利用；假使說民治陣綫紮得緊，使她們彼此都不能利用；假使說英法的分化作用，仍像歐戰時一般有效，那末這軸心馬上就要折斷，不但添一些裂痕而巳。</p>
<p>現在離開折斷的時間，固然似乎還很早；但是世事多變，誰說得定；此外則旦旦而伐之，終必有迅速折斷之一日！</p>
<h3 id="c114">急變 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>

<p>「嗡——」！飛機不停的在頭頂的天空裏盤旋。不時還有「轟！轟！」的炸彈聲，接着是房屋的倒坍聲，亂烘烘地。</p>
<p>大家不安地打狗窠似的被窩裏爬出來，擠到門口，爭着那個五寸見方的小洞向外望。甬道裹，黑暗暗，陰沉沉的，連平時呼么喝六的獄丁們，也不知全溜到那兒去了。</p>
<p>「人呢！人呢！王八蛋！爬到那個烏龜洞裏去了啊！往日呼么喝六的，全是你們的世界，現在可溜了嗎？媽的！」强盜犯阿徐猛烈地擂着門。</p>
<p>「聽狗二（獄丁）說，這幾天外面打得很兇，離開這裏不遠呢！怎麽好！」竊犯王阿萬獨自憂慮地說着。</p>
<p>「嗡——！轟！轟！」飛機又在扔炸彈了。</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛，炸彈生眼睛，不要下在這裏呀！饒我這條老狗命吧！唉！唉！」販土犯施老四哭聲地說，說舉又把頭蒙在被頭中去了。</p>
<p>「要炸就炸死你這種幹殺人不見血勾當的賊種！俺阿徐明槍交戰，爽爽快快地，白刀子進，紅刀子出！要死就死，你有這種氣？烏！」阿徐狠狠地說。</p>
<p>「我死，看你不死。唉唉！」施老四鑽出被窩，却又縮了進去。</p>
<p>「你說！你說！我先揍死你再說。」阿徐要趕過去動手，却給王阿才同另一個竊犯馬新根拉住了。</p>
<p>「你老哥何苦跟這老頭兒爭吵！」王阿才勸着阿徐，又回過頭對馬新根說道：「狗二還說上頭要把我們釋放呢！」</p>
<p>「俺不怕死！不過要死麽就得死得爽快，跟鬼子拚，死了也有面子，要呌俺糊裏糊塗的給鬼子兵炸死在牢裏，呌俺用什麽話來交代閻王，還有我那狠天狠地的爺老子？」阿徐自語着，接着它自擂着門，駡道：「王八蛋！開門呀！」</p>
<p>忽然甬道裏傳來「陣匆迫的脚步聲。阿徐打洞裏望出去，看見狗二領頭，後面跟着七八個兵，走過來了。不覺破口大駡道：「「王八蛋，你來了啊！我當你鑽在烏龜洞裏淹死了呀！開門，讓俺去跟鬼子拚！」說畢又猛烈地擂着門。</p>
<p>「別鬧：別鬧！典獄長來了就放你們這班狗！」</p>
<p>狗二這句話說得很響，差不多間間囚房都淸楚了。囚徒們眞樂得合不上嘴巴！大家忙着，急着。</p>
<p>一會兒，典獄長來了。狗個兵。</p>
<p>十五號，十六名；三十穴號……」典獄長照着簿子唸，狗二開鏈鎖，陳良才點人。</p>
<p>千多名囚犯，把整個甬道都擠滿了。典獄長站在出口處的一隻櫈上，大聲說道：「外面戰事很緊迫，敵人離開這裏不遠了。我奉得命令釋放你們！你們在這裏，有的是十年二十年，有的是三年五年，大家都能循規蹈矩的過着。國家待你們也不薄，現在放你們出去，望你們出獄後，能够改過自新，不要再犯罪作惡！要做一個好人！要對得起國家和你們的祖宗！好啦！你們走吧！出門時不要擠，不要亂，不要擠在一起，敵人的飛機窺見了要扔炸彈的！」</p>
<p>呀！千多個從心田裏發出來的歡呼，接着大家就開始移動脚了。正在這時，阿徐搶上一步，大聲說道：</p>
<p>「慢啦慢些！俺阿徐也有幾句話說：俺阿徐從前是做强盜的！黑的槍，白的刀，紅的血，俺都玩過。俺要死，幾十次也死過了！可是現在俺仍舊活着。俺在這裏坐了十三個年頭了，幾片瓦，幾塊磚，俺都背得出。國家麥俺十三年，待俺不薄。從前，俺們最對不起國家！現在，俺們要拿什麼來報答我們的國家？俺們的老家給鬼子們毀了，田是變成了荒丘，妻女給姦了，還有什麼家！俺們就跟鬼子們拚了吧！殺一憫，够本！殺一雙，賺一個！有種的跟俺阿徐走！」</p>
<p>有我的！有咱的！還有我！我—幾百個鐵一般的洪聲。</p>
<p>阿徐領頭，後面是幾百個壯士。一支鐵的隊伍，一條鐵的洪流，出獄去了！</p>

<p>在春天，那溫柔之神，作一陣和風，將我送入夢之海！</p>
<p>我在夢之海中飄蕩，駕着那鮮花般的小舟，任意駛向東西！</p>
<p>夢之海偉大啊！這是一個極樂的世界，有着人類中所沒有的珍寶，那裏有珍珠島，玫瑰林，美麗的鳥兒，掠過天空，活潑的魚兒，在海底跳躍，那淸澄的海水，從無波瀾；這夢之海，充滿了愉快的空氣！</p>
<p>小舟向前進行着，到了另一個世界，那海水是黃色的，那裏的天空，佈滿了灰黯的彤雲，海中的魚兒，呆呆地躱在水中，這是多麼愁慘，多麽凄凉一小舟，祇要有着去路，牠不會停止的。那夢之海的一端，是個可怕的世界，雷雨，暴風，將波濤掀起，好似山嶺，小舟停留不着了，海中的大魚，張開血盆似的口，吞噬一切！</p>
<p>可怕呵！夢之海，我不願再投身在這裏了！</p>
<p>我鼓着氣，奮勇地將小舟搖出這可怕的世界！</p>
<p>那夢之海，茫茫無際，小舟的力量，永遠找不到陸地！</p>
<p>我祇有咬緊了牙，屏着氣，從舟中向空中跳去</p>

<h3 id="c117">關於民族英雄傳記的寫作 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>關於民族英雄傳記的寫作，現在大家都認爲很需耍的，因爲牠一方面不但可以發揚我們先民所表示的民族的人格，一方面還可以激勵我們後生今日對於民族應有的認識。這種寫作，當然以大衆爲對象，所以牠的寫作，第一應用大衆所能瞭解的文字，不能從古史上抄錄一些就算；第二必須根據可靠的材料編寫，不能把材料加以曲解，如演義小說加入無謂的神怪故事；第三必須加以簡要注釋，如地名官名之類，免得讀者讀了有所隔閡。我近來因爲搜集一些這方面的材料，可惜都使我覺得有些欠妥的地方，茲敢略抒鄙見，與讀者諸君一加商榷。</p>
<p>第一，我所謂應用大衆所瞭解的文字，這在現在所巳出版的民族英維傅記諸書，都已沒有問題。只有商務一套「少年業書」，仍是用文言寫的，那是因爲出版日期猶在民國初年，無怪如此。不過像易君左所寫「文天祥」與「史可法」二書（新生命出版），關於對話部分，仍引用原文，不加譯解，這實在是很不當的。譬如「文天祥」中考官王應麟看了天祥的試卷，對帝有云：「是卷古誼若龜鑑，忠肝如鐵石。」「忠肝如鐵石」或者還可瞭解，「古誼若龜鑑」，試問大衆如何能懂？不過將文言譯爲白話，有時候的確也是很困難的，所以我以爲像這種地方，我們只寫其大意，不必定要照原文對譯。同時用語體寫作，也不能過於文藝化，如吳曙天所寫的「岳飛」（兒童出版），開首寫太陽烏鴉，頗具詩意，這在一般大衆看來，也並不感到興趣。况且故事本身是轟轟烈烈的，我以爲不妨開門見山，熱鬧上塲，此種富有詩意的環境，實在不能引起讀者的情緖。正如一齣戰事劇本，開幕却是一塲美麗花園佈景，總覺得有些不大對勁罷！</p>
<p>第二，我所謂必須根據可靠的材料編寫，這本來是不成問題的。但問題却在把可靠的材料，有的仍有誤解的地方。譬如章衣萍的「文天祥」（兒童出版）在「京口逃難」一節中說：「天祥跟着元軍一路行去，舟過錢塘，看見西湖山水如畫，不禁悲從中來，淚下如雨。後過吳門，至京口。」按天祥時在臨安（今杭州）北　亭山元營，被伯顏强迫北行，此行實由運河而北，故過吳門（今蘇州），而至京口（今鎭江）。旣在臨安之北起程，則天祥如何能再見「西湖山水如畫」？宋史中明無比吾，却被章君誤拉進去了。又同節說，「那個監押天祥的人，名字呌做王千戶。」安千戶係官織名，並非名字，此種也是誤解，與原意大相差異。又如易君左的「文天祥」，也有司樣誤處，如說：「最定元年，朝廷封他做鎭南軍節度。」按劉岳申文丞相傳原云：「授寗海軍節度判官廳公事。天祥上書乞斬董宋臣，不報，自免歸。以前職改鎭南軍。」是鎭甫軍亦爲節度判官廳公事，非節度也。且此非封爵，只是除官，亦不能稱之爲「封」。再如吳曙天的「岳飛」，在牠「洞庭湖大戰」中，竟誤「張浚爲「張俊」，更可謂疏忽之至，不知浚俊原係兩人，豈可混爲一談。又張浚時爲都督諸路軍馬，岳飛不過一員大將，以今日情形譬之，一是總司令，一是軍長，軍長對司令自有尊卑之分。但吳君寫岳飛對張浚說話，却是：「用不着，你只要下令留兵八天，我包管盪平洞庭湖。」按宋史飛本傳，則謂：「巳有定盡。都督能少留，不八日可破賊，」明明是稱都督而不用汝，被她改用一個「你」字，直如命令式的，這實在不成爲對上說話的語氣了。</p>
<p>第三我所調必須加以簡單的注釋，原因是古今名稱不同，非加以注釋，實難使大衆瞭解。譬如岳飛討李成一節，李成遺將進犯「洪州」。這洪州在現在地圖上是沒有的，若加注釋「即今江西南昌」，覺非使讀者更易於明瞭？又如上面所舉文天祥爲「寗海軍節度判官廳公事」，這在現在也沒有這種官名，我們不妨簡耍的說，道是專管文牘會計的官。可惜我們所看到的諸書，大多沒有顧到這些，尤其是官名，都不加以注釋。</p>
<p>以上所說，只就個人管見。所列諸書，也只是隨便舉例，如有冒昧之處，務請原作者舉與讀者加以原諒！</p>

<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>四月一日，是從歐美流行到中國來的「萬愚節」，也可說是「造謠節」，因為大家在這一天上，趁着高興，都不妨揑　　一些謠言，愚弄一下朋友，以資笑樂。好在節稱「萬愚」，朋友就是愛了你的欺弄，也是一笑置之，不會認眞扳面孔的。</p>
<p>過去的每個「萬愚節」，在歐美各國社會間所鬧出的愚人的和受愚的笑話，固然不勝　述。就在中國，除了朋友間展出欺弄朋友的手腕，來點綴這具歐化的佳節外，有幾家報館，也在這天上造過謠言，如當梅蘭芳赴美演戲，行將返國的時候，大公報就乘萬愚節的這天，造個假電報，說梅蘭芳已回上海。這個消息便害了兩個日本記者，忙打電報向東京報告。廣州有一張呌商報的，也在萬愚節上，刋出了一篇阮玲未死新聞，上海有些報紙見了，竟也信以為眞，連忙轉載，有的　出特刋，號外哩。</p>
<p>不過，今年的「萬愚節」，情形當鮁不同於往睥，在朋友之間，當然誰也將不忍再用這種無聊的愚弄手段，以開人家的玩笑。負着報道責任的新聞紙，處在這個偉大而嚴肅的時期，更不會再有這種　情雅興。但是，也惟在這個偉大而嚴肅的時期，我們在實際上，差不多天天在過着「萬愚節」，天天應該謹愼小心，提防人家在不絕施展出的愚弄技倆。不是嗎，人家為欲置我民族於萬刧不竹復之地，但非武力可以奏效，抑且證明其已失敗，於是窮思極想的散播出許多謠言，施展出種種愚弄手腕，希望償他們的心願。又因他們的謠言，都是那些陰謀家的結晶品，一不經意，便有受其欺騙的可能，怕以我們對於這種謠言，應對付「萬愚節」一樣的謹愼，在冷靜的觀察，精密的分析之下，堅定我們的信心，以不屈不撓的太度去答覆他，使他無以施展愚人的技倆！</p>
<h3 id="c119">「總檢討」？ <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 吳仭之</p>
<p>讀「上海劇運的低潮」有感</p>
<p>旅岡先生在香港大公報上發表了一篇「上海劇運的低潮」，副標題是「孤島能見度壇總檢討」，文章相當地長，政治術語相當地多。但是，僅僅登了兩期之後，上海所有的劇人便已看不下去。原因不是不受「總檢討」，而遺憾的是怕謂「檢討」的根據不是事實，而是虛搆；所糾正所指摘不僅撲空，而且形成搆陷，流於代替桎梏上海劇運的惡勢力辯護。政治衛語之運用也變成他自己的炫玩和給人帶的帽子。李健吾先生僅僅看了二月二十八日和三月一日兩期的登載，便已經覺得「有立即更正一下的必要」指出了六點事實的更正。（一）上海藝術劇院不是青島的一枝，更遑論乎正統」（二）上海藝術劇院裏沒有發見所謂某通俗文學家（按係指阿英先生）在裏面作「任何把持的事實」。（三）上海藝術劇院自來沒有過問曉風事　。（四）上海藝術劇院裏也有從前的業餘實騐劇團的同人，旅岡先生不該製造事件來挑撥在內地從事艱辛工作的業餘劇團同人和孤艱辛工作的業餘劇團同人和孤島劇人的感情。（五）上海藝術劇院的致命傷在於外來的破壞以及登記未得充許，而登記的困難是各劇團共同的遭遇，用不着妄加探測。至於外來的破壞有連接的兩對恐嚇信。（旅岡先生否認外來惡勢力，代之辯護，不識是何立論）（六）曉風事件是一個謎，製了版在大晚報發表的名單是澈查者：這與孤島劇人的政治道德　關，談不上「可憾」。最後，李先生又指出了幾點：（一）「有人說，他（指旅岡先生）是反對文明戲改良的蕭　先生。也許不是。有一件事是眞的：就是他沒有和孤島人事劇運的有過較深的來往。」（二）「孤島劇　的四門大開。站在一條綫的，人人進來，只有旅岡先生看見「宗派主義」。並且把李先生自己的沒有被人「一脚踢開」來做見證。（三）在孤島上從事劇運的一批？</p>
<p>青年可敬而可悲，他們的沈毅怕是旅岡先生所意想不到的。李先生和這些青年厮混了一年，感動地「如今顯鮁和他們打成了一片」了。現在旅岡先生的大作已經登完，大家也看全了。在事實方面當然有更多更多的更正可以補充。不過，不懂為什麼，在這裏，我不想再多寫「辯白」與「更正」。但也忍不住不寫，因為對於這篇文章有很多感想。那末就寫感想吧。</p>
<p>「旅岡」「宗鈺」與「蕭旄」</p>
<p>大公報對於這篇文章的預告是「宗鈺」，發表出來却是「旅岡」而滬上的傳說又是反對文明戲改良的「蕭旄」。在文明戲改良座談會上又同意改良的旅岡（座談紀錄見大晚報）我是文壇人事最不熱悉的，自然也談不上「仇恨」。因此，我天眞地在這裏想：「旅岡」是不是「蕭旄」？為什麼「旅岡」的文章裏對於「文明戲改良運動」的論事的結束說：「遭結束，證明『為了生活』以及『文明戲的改造』（蕭旄）—原文如此—這幾篇含有建設性底鬥爭的理論之正確。」？假使這兩個名字是一個人的話，恕我天眞地批評兩個字——卑鄙！「文人無行」，我從來不相信這話。讀了旅岡先生的「政治道德」這類話，我倒有點「憮然」之感了。但是可惜的却不在此，面晨於上海劇運的由此受到無謂的冤枉。</p>
<p>工作表面的「檢討」與內部組識的「檢討」</p>
<p>像如「沒有一位能夠說出他在圈子裏面」的旅岡先生能就他所見到的工作的表面來做做「檢討」，也許還能使人感到中肯。其實連這一點，旅岡先生做來尚有問題，比如他說「不夜城」是改良文明戲的成就。不知這劇本是在改良文明戲之前的六個月演出的。若要談到內部組織的「檢討」，却不以眞確的事實做根據，做出發點，得來的「理論」像免不掉錯誤。是必然的。自己理論的錯誤不足惜，可惜的是上海劇運受到壞的影響利害。不顧影響利害，感情用事地誣誹謗，借旅岡先生自己的話是：「擴大了自己的錯誤，使自己在觀衆及讀者之前，陷於理論的破產」。我想其結果是暴露自己，為親者所痛，仇者稱快！（上）</p>
<h3 id="c120">「海軍之翼」觀感 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>（Wings　of　the　Navy）</p>
<p>華納公司出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>在報上，各國擴軍的親聞我們眞是司空見慣了：在銀幕上，則有關軍備的電影在近來也和我們大大有綠。我們知道，這是不會沒有綠由的。</p>
<p>因之，我們以同樣的理解來看這張「海軍之翼」的時候，也許在對主題的了解上，有一點帮助。</p>
<p>「海軍之翼」是又一張描寫航空的影片，這裏相當詳盡的介紹了空軍人員如何造成的過程，當中也揷入了手足之情和兒女之私。</p>
<p>是的，我應當說明，「海軍之翼」對造成一個空軍人員的過程，是說得相當詳盡的，從入學試騐以至於盲目飛行，這裏面都用盡面表達了出來，作者又怕打斷觀衆的勇氣，所以雖然也寫了他們的挫折，最後則都克服了難關，讓他們活躍在天空，這非但是最後的一個高潮是如此，就是平常，作者也是不厭其詳地在每一次失敗之後，接運又說明了他們的成功。這種苦心，我們是應當理解並接受的。</p>
<p>「海軍之翼」的主題是示威，也是鼓勵；而把他們縱橫地織接起來的，則還有一個戀愛故事。</p>
<p>這個戀愛故事是三角戀愛，但作者並沒有着力的去寫它，有關連的，則還是他們的事業方面的。</p>
<p>譬哪，除介紹了各　學課的過程之外，我閃在高空測騐的失事及成功的兩塲戲中可看出來。</p>
<p>這兩塲戲是對照着寫的，第一次飛機上昇，突然下降，駕駛者受氣壓　　擊而暈厥，直跌而下，凱司疑怕焦急的臉色，飛機墜地的響聲，許多人員飛奔前去救護，凱司木立的背影；第二塲是凱司發現他的弟弟即是第二次的高空測騐的駕駛者，他想攔阻，但為傑利的同伴抱住了，傑利就駕機而上，又是上昇到高空，又是突然下降，又是受氣壓　擊，傑利幾乎暈厥，飛機從直降而下而搖幌不定，凱司和愛琳焦急怕慮的神色，飛機終於突然破難關而定了下來，於是凱司倆如釋重負的的歡笑。這兩塲戲，在織接上，是幾乎相同的，尤期是受氣壓襲擊快要暈厥，飛機直跌而下的幾具鏡頭。但我們並沒有感到他的重覆和冗長，反之，却反而因之而把情緒提到高掦起來，這樣明快而富於魄力的織接，是極為可愛的。而喬治勃倫和奧　薇哈佛蘭的如釋重負的微笑，也成了代表觀衆的微笑。</p>
<p>奧麗薇哈佛蘭的戲不多，憑良心說這個戲內她不能算是主角，那些眞正的主角，到是各種的飛機。戲呢，也以上舉的那塲戲為最好。喬治勃倫和約翰潘納，也是如此。</p>

<p>我國自「一九一八」「一二八」事變後，努力建設空軍，全國青年，聞風而來，高樂趙三人經過體格學科初試覆試，及格後加入空軍入伍生營，受陸軍軍訓一年，始升學飛行生，開學時恭聆訓話，領受空軍訓條及空軍信條，合唱航校校歌，雄壯凌雲。</p>
<p>高樂趙與飛行生顧長空等同受高志航大隊長之敎練，分組學習初級飛行，初决入雲，如登天境。</p>
<p>機械官施起，忠於服務，嘗戲吿高趙，機械士乃玩鳥者；洗之刷之，醫之飼之，使其能飛能鳴能鬭，惟此乃鐵鳥耳。　千百充滿熱血靑年，爲國家扶植訓練，猶如千百鐵塊，在熔爐中鍛鍊成鋼，高樂趙等飛行生決將未來國家重任，加諸己肩，在鐵的訓練規律下早起，上隊，習飛，運動，遊息，一天一天的勇敢前進，一年二年三年，趙樂高等均卒業而成為隊員，或充任訓練後來作軍飛行學生之敎官。</p>
<p>在刻苦緊張之訓練中，同時自應有相當之遊息，某星期日航校大門中開出四卡車離校赴與校外水菓店少女靑兒友善，照例，航校學生，均當在靑兒處購食大量水菓，是日高飛，趙萬里，施起，顧長空四摯友同在車上，施趙樂故與高顧為難，盡購青兒籃中水菓，擲與同車師友同食，載歌載笑，瞬抵杭市，諸空軍健兒遂分散或結伴同遊，或訪友，或攀山，或馳馬，或競舟，六橋三竺間，有空軍健兒爲之點綴，生色不少。</p>

<p>至於何玉風呢，她本是一位武將的愛女，雖說自幼從她父親學些武藝，不似安公子那樣的怯懦，然而她因時時刻刻不忘殺父的深　，到處訪查仇人的消息，不但是隱姓埋名，居無定所，恐遭紀賊的暗算，並且還得隨侍着她那年邁多病的老母，東逃西奔，度着流亡的生活，她心中的悲苦，當然比了安公子還耍加甚十倍呢。不過她也是同樣的存了一個「孝」的觀念，所以也把種種的痛苦，拋於無何有之鄉了。書中的兩個主人翁，都能不忘記做人的根本，要去作孝子孝女，故而他們雙方遇合之後，即成就美滿姻緣，雖說是中間隔了許多波折，費了安老先生（安公子之父，名學海。）多少心機，纔得如願以償，但是結果，總算把這位色藝雙全的俠孝女娶到家來，讓他兒子享受這種艷福，若要照迷信括講來，這全是由於他們小兩口的孝心所感，所以才能有此配合呢。</p>

<p>舞稿寫到第十六篇了，其間很少寫實的記載，大都會是我屐痕較頻的去處，所以印象也比較深刻一點，不妨據實（十六）寫來，請敎請較諸位同好。</p>
<p>舞廳一瞥</p>
<p>大都會，據適中的地點，有廣闊的園地，扶疎的樹木，雖然建築不及仙樂與百樂門講究，截長補短，也可以並稱無遜。門臨戈登路，旁爲大華路，停車極爲方便。第一重門內，設有一個雇銀色汽車的櫃台。第二重門內是待客室，兩旁設着衣帽間，公用電話間，男盥洗室等。第三重門內是一條過道，兩邊設着賣零食及售玩具的櫃台，在那裏常見有二位西裝筆挺的朋友擔任着招待，在那胖胖的臉上，總露着微笑和親善的顏色，來賓不論男婦老少，他們的態度是從來沒有變更的，眞個是和氣生財，大都會之所以生涯鼎盛，不能說這兩位沒有一部份的勞績。我是個健忘的人，祇記得那位年紀較輕的呌阿馮，聽說在裏面擔任着副經理之職呢。</p>
<p>穿過了過道，就是舞塲了，分着三級，沿邊最高，安設長沙發携伴極便、沙發前留出一圈單人行走的道路一次層設着許多圓桌客座，大的可容二三百人。末層就是舞池，池作圓形，極廣大，地板亦極光滑，池邊有二十八張圓桌，每桌設着四個座位，此乃是舞女們的寶座，倘若全數坐齊了，到也有一百十二位之多，不過頭尾的四桌，大概總是缺席的，舉目一望，大的總在百上百下之數罷。</p>
<p>燦爛紅星　現在要寫到各位燦爛的大紅星了，在未寫之先，先得告個罪，因為要一百位全寫呢，不但篇幅所不容，而且我也沒有這好記心，要是擇允寫呢，所謂「允者，究應以主觀爲標準，或以客觀爲標準呢，好在我寫的篇名本呌做寫影，不妨就根據些糊裏糊塗的印象，寫上些不淸不楚的評記，至於記的對不對，評的公不公，可以說簡直運我自己也莫名其妙。</p>
<p>從進門靠音樂台起算，第六張檺子坐着憫黄妹妹，雖在稚年，生得頗爲恬靜可喜，且頗懂人事，見人輒報以微笑，舞藝也還不弱。第七檯馬媛媛，本姓鄭，與黃係甥舅，窈窕玲瓏，白皙淸秀，年長於黃，而稚氣反勝，或謂其天眞，或嫌其任性，京戲能唱一二支，申曲越調，倒唱得很像，第九擡沈維英，遠看非常美麗，近視似乎稍遜。第十一擡葉佩珊，是個大個兒小孩子，若不問她年歲，再也猜不着她纔年方二八，而如滿月，目若明星，別具一種風格。李明珠是個年近花信的佳人，能以眉目傳言，談吐之間，當然更屬慣家了。茹愛娜貌頗娟好，胡妹妹善於逢迎，都是好的，第十二檯的兪曼麗，本名左仲玉，本可算得個美人胎子，可惜常年多病，即在平時，也免不了帶些病態，從前不大會說話，現在却進步多了，黄美琴昨日纔發見，舞藝甚好。第十三擡的金莉莉，舞藝眞够得上身輕如燕的考語，性情態度也說得起溫文大方，靑衣唱得有板有眼，嗓子也很受聽，據說她哥哥曾到我家學過胡琴的，她也想問我學些唱白身段，可憐師父呌了幾個月了，始終沒有學到一齣半齣，實在彼此沒有時間，也沒有辦法，她妹妹金弟弟乃是個十十足足的小孩子，模樣倒長得很像個美人胎子呢。同檯還有個顧玉梅，身長玉立，姿色頗佳，因爲報上載着一段她與雷小開涉訟的案子，生意就着實减色，聽說不久要出碼頭了。還有個李影，年華雙十，面部上半部，很有些像梅蘭芳，脾氣也和順得很，近來也想學戲，據說嗓子不錯，可惜我從未聽過。十四擡有個徐萃英，可稱交際能手。二十檯的曹素琴姊妹，一個是風韻猶存，一個是活潑可愛。個兒都很高，很宜與高個子客人伴舞。還有鄭明明，林倍倍，楊文英三人，與金莉莉同屬當選的十大舞星之一，黄花崗紀念日在百樂鬥舉行典禮，倒也熱鬧得很，篇幅已長，恕不多列，總之，大都會的人材，可算得齊整蒼萃的了。</p>
<p>今日因廣吿擁擠，篇幅縮小，棋苑暫停一次，明日照登，此啟。</p>

<h3 id="c142">負時代使命的　滇緬公路概述 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 葆丞</p>
<p>溯自戰事發生，瞬已二十閱月，沿海各省，相權淪陷，致使我國之正常國際交通，泰半梗阻，然而舉國上下，均能一德一心，埋首苦幹，一面在後方作種種利於作戰之工作，致全力於內地建設；一面則傾全力於國際交通，以謀與國外格外接近。他姑勿論，即以二十閱月來之交通建設言之，無論公路鐵路，莫不一日千里，進展神速。西南西北之整個交通網綫，均在此最短期間，次第完成，聞之令人興奮。就中最關國際交通性，允爲世人所注目者，殆爲新近完成之滇緬公路。</p>
<p>按雲貴川桂數省，爲大山絕壑包圍，交通路綫，至爲艱險，昔日行旅，莫不視爲畏途。乃自抗戰以來，經年餘建設，所有內地交通，已均暢通無阻，行旅稱便，然而所謂國際交通者，向均集中於沿海諸省，時至今日，則除經昆明，循滇越鐵路，以通法屬海防一綫；及西北公路，亦能直通俄屬之中央亞細亞外，已感對外交通之不能儘量發展。今者滇緬交通，已在羣策羣力之下，予以完成。中英交通，又吿實現，其功績之偉，使命之大，宜乎國人引以自慰，中外加以注目者也。</p>
<p>滇緬公路，起自雲南首府昆明，貫通滇西，横斷山脈，直達英　緬甸之八莫，全長一千一百四十餘公里，經年餘之光陰，在軍民合作修築之下，茲已完成，而達通車之目的。其途徑則自昆明迤西，經安寗，祿　，楚雄，鎭南，祥雲，鳳儀，而達大理之下關；更折而西南，渡瀾滄江，經保山而渡潞江，再循龍陵潞西而達滇緬交界處之畹町。自畹町起程，即入緬界，經程百七十公里以達緬北鐵路之終點八莫（Bbamo），循此即可下通緬甸首府仰光矣。</p>
<p>現在該路已由交通部滇緬公路管理局接收，客貨運輸，均在積極籌備。公共汽車，須行六日。第一日自昆明出發，至楚雄。第二日自楚雄出發，以達下關。第三日自下關至永平。第四日自永平至保山。第五日保山至龍陵。第六日自龍陵出發即達畹町矣。按畹町爲滇緬交界處，現尙無住宿處所，由此入緬界，即達北緬鐵路之八莫。所有沿綫之食宿停站，管理局已委由中國旅行社承辦，茲聞該社已在積極辦理，並派定大批幹練靑年，遠征滇邊，爲該路旅客作先鋒隊矣。</p>
<h3 id="c143">如何赴湘桂 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 景洵</p>
<p>凡赴湘桂各地者，都認爲取道浙東口岸如溫州或寗波，再由公路至金華，然後搭乘浙贛，粤漢，湘桂三路聯運通車赴湘桂各地，爲最穩捷最經濟的途徑。以是取道該路者，亦日見擁擠，自從前數日浙贛鐵路停止通車後，取道該路，事實上巳不可能，現在將赴湘桂各地之另一途徑，詳述於后：</p>
<p>上海至海防　直接開往者，有太古或怡和公司輪船，船期每星期的一二决，途經汕頭，香港，廣州灣等埠，需時的十日可達。票價分大菜間國幣二百二十一元及二百三一十一元，二等大菜間一百九十六元，官艙九十四元，房艙六十八元，統艙三十七元（運海防登岸稅在內）。如由滬搭趁郵船赴港，然後由港轉乘法輪小廣東或羅斯輪及太古或怡和輪船赴防亦可，唯其票價較直放輪船爲昂。</p>
<p>海防至河內　每日快車及慢車各五决，火車行駛二小時餘可達，僅分二三等兩種，二等越幣二元一角，三等越幣一元二角五分。（每一越幣，的合國幣一元七角）。</p>
<p>河內至諒山　搭趁越南國有鐵路火車至離河內一五四公里之諒山。火車每日上午五點五十分及下午〇點二十分由河內開，的五小時半可達。票價頭等越幣八·八八元，二等五·九二元，三等二·四四元。</p>
<p>諒山至龍州　廣西龍州距離諒由八十公里，有公共汽車可通，需果約四小時，票價約需國幣十地獄。</p>
<p>龍州至邕寗　邕寗即南寗，自龍至邕，距離二四九公里，有公路汽車可通，行程一日可達。中途在綏淥午膳，票價國幣十一元三角半。</p>
<p>邕寗至柳州　距離二六〇公里，有公路汽車可通，行程一日可達，票價國幣十一元七角。（由柳州即可轉赴貴陽，重慶等地。）</p>
<p>柳州至桂林　距離二四二公里，公路汽車約行六小時半可達。中途在荔浦午膳，票價國幣十兀九角。</p>
<p>桂林至衡陽　距離三五四公里，湘桂鐵路火車每日開行特快車及混合車各一次，需時的十一小時餘。票價三等五元三角，二等十元六角，頭等十五元九角。</p>
<p>衡陽至長沙　距離一二七公里，可趁粤漢鐵路火車，需時的八小時可達。票價三等二元四角，二等四元八角，頭等七元。</p>
<p>（附註）取道上述路綫，須備具經過越南之過境護照及供職機關或商舖之身份證明書。</p>
<h3 id="c144">經過越南　應予注意之事 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 景</p>
<p>自從由香港入內地的交通中斷以來，取道法屬越南而入內地，是國人所共知的一條最迅速最穩妥的一條交通綫了！抗戰以前，這條途徑，除非是要到越南或滇省經商或返籍的方才要利用牠外，一般人對此是異常生疏的，因爲這個緣故，現在該路雖然稱爲到內地去的要道，但是一般取道越南赴內地去的旅客，大都還是初次呢！關於由越南至滇省或其他各地的交通情形，報端亦常有詳細的紀載，所以可不贅述。下面所寫的，是一些應該注意的事件：</p>
<p>一、護照　凡赴內地而欲經過越南的旅客，事前都要備具我國政府所頒發的護照，由法領署加蓋了過境簽字後，方可就道。當輪船離開香港後，那所持的護照都需交給船上管事，在抵海防後可托華商會館代領。（詳情請見上期）在河口入國境時，應將身份證明書繳騐，如認爲有些可疑，該檢查機關將以電報向出具證番之機關或商舖詢問，俟有回電，方允放行，所以在出發前，對於身份證書，絕對不可疏忽。</p>
<p>二、行李　越海關對於旅客所携帶的行李，檢查很嚴，凡是遇到新的物件，如絲。綢。呢。布。衣料。化裝用品等，都要按照過境稅率（國貨百分之一，洋貨百分之四）抽稅。旅客如有新購的物件，不妨儘量檢出，歸納在一起，以便至海關時，自行指出，靜待關員審定，應吾納稅，則其餘的行李可以從簡檢查。假使將新的東西密裹在被褥或衣袋夾層內，被查出時，認爲有意偷稅，將行李扣留，更要嚴行處罰。所以携帶被褥時，最好把被褥的一端不要縫上，免得在被檢查時發生麻煩，至於自來火。煙。及其他違禁品，是絕對禁止帶入的。</p>
<p>三、碼頭　海防碼頭情形很亂，旅客應特別留意，如有重要物件，宜鎖藏在大箱內，或皮夾內，因爲該埠　手頗多，允其是帽子，自來水筆，或鉛筆等，更宜留意。設使被竊，在此人地生疏的地方，更加言語不通，且該埠站崗巡警很少，眼見東西被竊，亦無辦法，最好結伴同行，互相照應爲妥。該埠市區內之交通工具，多以洋車代步，較近者車資的越幣五分，較遠者一角。</p>
<p>四、語言越南通用的語言，爲法。越。粤三種。旅客到此，因爲語言不通的緣故，很痛苦。一般人都以爲英語可以通行，事實並不是如此。好在中國旅行社在車站及輪船碼頭，都派有招待員照呼一切，如遇到雙方言語不能領會的時候，可以請該社的招待員代爲翻譯。</p>
<p>五、氣候　海防氣候很是暖和，現在的時候，巳經可以穿單衣了。旅客到了海防，不要因爲氣候暖和而把冬衣鎖藏起來，因爲假使乘火車到昆明，在車過庸買後，氣候是很冷的，那時候就可以把隨身携帶的冬衣加穿上，藉以禦寒。至於昆明的氣候，早晚很凉，中午的時候平均在攝氏七十度左右。</p>
<p>六、飲食　越南各地飲食，大都係西餐，所用麫包，堅硬異常，此間人士對此，很是不慣。如要用中餐，該地也有粤菜。乘坐火車，車上並不供給膳食，一切均需自己携帶。越南雲南各地如老街等地，產水菜頗豐，價目亦很賤，但是在當地生產的水菓，切勿在當地購食，因爲此種水菓，在樹上生長時，日受瘴氣，食之容易致疾。至於飯料，亦以自已隨身挑帶爲妥。</p>

<p>— 徐駿</p>
<p>美國政府在紐約的Flushing　Meadow　Park　Borough　of　Queens舉辦了一個夏令營，所有的建築和風長區，共佔有一千二百十六英畝的廣大面積。除原有的鐵路公路全都能够直達該營，交通可以說是十分便利外，現在又新築了一條直達該營的公路。這個夏令營的目的，共分爲兩大類：（一）供給旅客前往避暑，（二）是招請各國將著名的商品運去展覽或者是發售。</p>
<p>展開的日期，業巳逼近了，是自本年的四月三十日起始，爲期已定六個月，要到本年的十月三十日方始閉幕。在該營區域裏政府衛生處並設有醫藥顧問及保險銀行等機關，範圍是非常的偉大。凡是由中國或是自香港出發前往參加的旅客，該營已的定了中國旅行社代他們辦理護照等手續，所有輪船票及經大陸而往美國的火車票，也全由中國旅行社發售。行李貨物，該社也代辦出口手續。又凡是往紐的參觀此項夏令營的，應先備遊覽護照和請領無定額移民入境證，該社照樣的能够辦理。最後美國政府對於進口貨物，祇在營內展覽而並不出售的，可以免去進口稅的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The European Anti-Aggression Front is Nearing Completion: Chamberlain Declares Full Support for Poland, France States a Similar Stance, Soviet Government Also Fully Approves <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, this afternoon, delivered a statement in the House of Commons, saying, "I am very pleased to have the opportunity to explain our country's foreign policy again today. The British government has always had a consistent policy, namely, when disputes arise between countries, we advocate for adjustments through free negotiations. We believe this is the natural and proper way to handle disputes. As far as the British government is concerned, there is no issue in the world that cannot be resolved peacefully. If force or the threat of force is used instead of negotiations, we see no reason for it. As for the current situation, the government is consulting with other governments, as I am sure members of the House of Commons are aware. So far, the exchange of views between the countries concerned has not been completed. However, to fully explain the British government's position, I would like to solemnly declare to the members of the House of Commons that should any action threaten the independence and sovereignty of Poland, and should that country deem it necessary to resist with all its national strength, the British government will immediately provide full assistance. The British government has provided this guarantee to the Polish government, and the French government has authorized me to declare on its behalf that it holds the same attitude as Britain. However, reports of a certain country planning to attack Poland have not yet been officially confirmed by the British government, and we cannot consider them to be true." At this point, the Prime Minister also answered a question from a member of Parliament, saying, "I believe that the points I have just stated are already very clear, but I must add that all that I have said is only for the transitional period before the countries concerned have completed their exchange of views." These so-called countries concerned include the Soviet Union. Foreign Secretary Halifax spoke at length with the Soviet Ambassador Maisky this morning. "The principles on which the British government's actions are based have been fully understood and approved by the Soviet government." In addition, one more point must be stated, namely that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck will come to London within the next week. (Members of Parliament applaud.) Recently, Mr. Greenwood spoke of promoting the maximum degree of cooperation, and I agree. Once Foreign Minister Beck arrives here, we can hold talks with him to discuss various ways to establish the maximum degree of cooperation to prevent aggression and seek the realization of a more rational form of negotiation to replace force." Prime Minister Chamberlain then answered a question from a member of Parliament, saying, "The government's actions have been notified to the various autonomous territories at any time, and I have no hesitation in guaranteeing that there is no disagreement between Britain and the Soviet Union in terms of thought," (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) The Prime Minister entered the House at 2:50 PM, and everyone cheered to welcome him. Prime Minister Chamberlain said, "The House knows that the British government is currently in consultation with other governments. In order to make the British government's position clear before this consultation is concluded, I am now informing the House that, during the consultation period, should any action clearly endanger the independence of Poland, and should the Polish government deem it necessary to resist with all its national force, the British government feels it has an inescapable duty to immediately assist Poland with all the power it can. The British government has given this guarantee to the Polish government." His remarks are intended to cover the period when the British government is in consultation with other governments. The arrival of Polish Foreign Minister Beck in London will provide an opportunity to discuss various plans, so that any cooperative efforts to end aggression can reach the highest degree, and a more rational and orderly method of discussion can replace the current consultations. This afternoon's important statement and supplementary questions and answers in the House of Commons took only seventeen minutes. Then the House announced an adjournment until April 3. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated clearly in the House of Commons this afternoon that Britain will not stand idly by while other countries continue to engage in aggression in Europe. The British government's decision was the result of thorough discussions between the cabinet and the governments of Britain, France, Poland, and Romania yesterday. The detailed measures agreed upon remain secret, but their characteristic is to make recommendations to the two Baltic countries to expand their mutual assistance agreements to include the possibility of being attacked by Germany. It is heard that Poland made the decision late yesterday to accept this recommendation, and there is no doubt that Romania will accept it as well. Britain and France then decided that if either of the two Baltic countries becomes the target of German aggression in the future, Britain and France are prepared to come to their aid. The sudden acceleration of negotiations between the four capitals is largely due to disturbing news of military plans coming from the German side. The officials of the four countries, after receiving this alarming news, felt that if they waited for Polish Foreign Minister Beck to arrive in London on April 3 to discuss the matter, they would risk the great danger of not being able to decide on a position to resist the invasion.

<h3 id="e2">Tense Relations Between Germany and Poland: Britain Holds a Special Cabinet Meeting, Polish Foreign Minister to Visit Britain as Scheduled, America Also Determined to Support by Denying Rumors <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(London) The sudden convening of the British cabinet meeting today has caused considerable surprise among the general public. According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, the meeting gave special consideration to information concerning Poland. It is believed that this cabinet meeting was decided last night, and it is expected that the information concerning Poland considered at today's cabinet meeting may not prove to be the final conclusion. It is hoped that Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to London next week may clarify the current situation. At the same time, it is heard that the cabinet members are unanimous and resolute in their opinions on the proposed anti-aggression declaration. According to a Reuters correspondent, if there is any delay in the issuance of this declaration, the main reason must be due to close discussions with France, as this step is necessary before the final draft of the declaration is issued. Also, judging from the fact that the opposition party did not raise any questions during today's meeting of the House of Commons, it can be seen that opinions in Parliament have become stronger. This situation is quite obvious tonight. A Reuters correspondent repeatedly stated that all political parties are willing for the government to issue a declaration as soon as possible, and that no one wants to hinder the government's work. After today's cabinet meeting, the cabinet members who are most closely related to foreign affairs did not leave, in order to continue the discussion. The content of today's cabinet meeting is currently being kept strictly secret, but it is heard that the government is still determined to maintain and develop its efforts to prevent continued aggression. According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, the government's views have become significantly stronger in the past forty-eight hours, largely due to information coming from overseas. The strict secrecy of the cabinet meeting has given rise to many rumors that the government may take certain actions, but such news can only be regarded as speculation. At the same time, consultations between the capitals of various countries, especially London and Paris, are currently underway. Polish Ambassador to Britain Raczynski visited the British Foreign Office today and held consultations at the Foreign Office after the cabinet meeting adjourned. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the Prime Minister's Office suddenly convened a special cabinet meeting, which began as early as 8:45 AM, which is unprecedented. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Minister for Coordination of Defence Chatfield, Minister for Dominion Affairs Inskip, and First Lord of the Admiralty Stanhope were all present. It lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes before adjourning. It is believed that the cabinet members discussed the speech that the Prime Minister will deliver in the House of Commons this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) The British cabinet has decided that if Poland and Romania are attacked by foreign countries, Britain will provide assistance. This decision indicates that British foreign policy has entered a new stage. Negotiations between the capitals of the countries concerned are currently underway. After receiving the replies of France and Poland regarding the British guarantee treaty plan, Britain has notified Moscow and is continuing negotiations with it. Romania and Poland are also currently in negotiations with Britain, to a degree that is significantly deeper than is generally known. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) Germany has concentrated troops in Pomerania, especially in the area of ​​Frankfurt on the Oder River. The situation on the border between Poland and Germany is therefore extremely tense. After this news reached London, the British government was extremely concerned. Although the latest news said that two German divisions had been transferred from the vicinity of the Polish border to other places, the uneasiness here has not been dispelled. The cabinet therefore held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the matter. The cabinet's foreign affairs committee also held a meeting in the afternoon. According to reliable sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain has decided to issue a statement in the House of Commons tomorrow morning, saying that if Poland is invaded by Germany, Britain and France will immediately come to its aid. Political figures have recently commented that although Britain and France have agreed to help Poland, it is still possible for Germany and Poland to reach a friendly solution regarding the issues of the Free City of Danzig and the construction of a highway across the Polish Corridor between the German provinces of Pomerania and East Prussia. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to sources in diplomatic and other circles, the U.S. government believes that Europe will remain tense in the near future, and believes that the dictatorships intend to impose "another Munich" on the democracies. Therefore, the United States will relax neutrality laws next week, hoping to help create a "peace of unyielding." (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Warsaw Polish President Moscicki met with seven important members of the opposition parties, as well as university professors related to the opposition parties, at Warsaw Palace yesterday to discuss Polish foreign and domestic affairs for three hours. Political figures are paying close attention to this. Moscicki then met with the leader of the National Peasant Party and informed him that the government would implement amnesty laws to assist the leader of the party, former Prime Minister Witos. Witos had previously fled abroad and recently returned to Poland. All parties regard the President's move as a symbol of seeking harmony among all parties. However, informed sources said that the facts are not as simple as that, and this view cannot be regarded as definitive. In recent years, President Moscicki has often summoned representatives of the opposition parties to listen to their opinions on national affairs, but has never put them into practice.

<p>Warsaw Rumors that Germany has presented an ultimatum to Poland or that it has exerted pressure on Poland have recently been denied by the local newspapers, which published a semi-official message stating, "We are now authorized by the authorities to solemnly declare that Poland has neither received any ultimatum nor felt any pressure."

<p>Warsaw The newspapers here tonight unanimously stressed that Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to London is extremely important. Observers do not believe the rumor that Beck will get off the train in Berlin midway. According to sources here, if Pack did this, it would only indicate that this was due to German pressure and would endanger the Polish government's freedom to conduct diplomacy. The Warsaw Daily, which is detached, criticized Poland's current position in Europe as extremely important. The whole world is now paying attention to Poland's actions. The newspaper also hinted that the week in which Beck returns to Warsaw from London will be the key to deciding on a policy towards Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is scheduled to visit Britain on the third of next month.

(Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berlin newspapers rarely mention Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's upcoming visit to London, and rarely report on current German-Polish relations. Regarding the rumor that Colonel Beck will travel to London via Berlin, the newspapers here stated that Colonel Beck's stay in Berlin will be very short and that he does not intend to hold any consultations with German officials. The newspapers have remained silent on the anti-German movement that has occurred in Poland in recent days. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Reuters has learned from well-informed sources that rumors that Germany has made demands on Poland, or even issued an ultimatum, are exaggerated. The authorities do not deny that Germany has made certain suggestions to Poland, but it is said that it is too early to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Germany has not urged Poland to build a highway through the "Polish Corridor." It is said that this road is difficult to construct and costly, and that its completion would provide smugglers with an excellent opportunity. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels is currently staying in Bavaria with Hitler, Aviation Minister Goering is currently in Italy, and Economic Minister Funk is currently busy with the affairs of the Deutsche Bank. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the cabinet will hold a secret meeting here. The newspapers have not yet revealed the authorities' opinions or aspirations regarding the Polish issue. Reuters has also learned that Polish Foreign Minister Beck will not get off the train midway when he travels from Warsaw to London next week. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Interior Minister Frick recently delivered a speech, saying that the minority residents of various countries enjoy preferential treatment within Germany. The situation of German minorities living in other countries, especially in Poland, is extremely difficult, which is regrettable. Although Germany and Poland jointly issued a statement in November 1937, the issue of the treatment of ethnic minorities on both sides has not been effectively resolved. Representatives of the two countries recently reopened negotiations here, hoping to reach a satisfactory solution as soon as possible. In addition, Germany is eager to cooperate peacefully with Yugoslavia, and hopes that the issue of the German minority in that country can be resolved reasonably. The situation of Germans in Denmark and Hungary is also not very satisfactory. However, if the authorities of various countries mistreat German minorities, then the residents of that country living in Germany will also receive the same treatment. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Warsaw The Warsaw Express recently reported that German minorities in the city of Rybnik in Upper Silesia have recently imitated the methods of the Sudeten German Party members in the former Czech Republic by wearing white socks and strolling the streets. After friendly persuasion from passers-by failed, many Polish citizens volunteered to remove the white socks worn by these people on the spot. In addition, there have been many similar provocative actions by the Germans, which have also been severely punished. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Rome) At present, the Italian people feel more uneasy about German-Polish relations than about French Prime Minister Daladier's speech. Gazzetta d'Italia criticized Daladier's speech, saying, "The French have clearly indicated that they want to close the door that we have opened, but Italians are not incapable of patience and can wait and see." (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Rome) After French Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech the other day, Italy will likely adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards France in the near future. As relations between Germany and Poland become increasingly tense, Italy is naturally paying close attention to future developments in the situation in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Therefore, it can only postpone things with France and wait and see how the situation unfolds before deciding what to do. Regardless of what the Italian government's intentions are, it is clear that the attitude of the Italian newspapers is generally very subtle and shows no sign of increasing the seriousness of the situation. Commentators generally say that although France's attitude is still strong, Italy can clearly recognize where its own rights lie, how strong its power is, and what its future may hold, so it can also wait patiently for the opportunity to arrive. Il Giornale d'Italia stated, "Italy does not ask for anything, but France should consider its own interests." (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Review and Prospects of Franco-Italian Relations <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>On the 26th of last month, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech at the 20th anniversary of the Fascist Party, making claims to France regarding rights in Tunisia, Suez, and Djibouti. At the time, Mussolini's attitude was relatively mild, but his spokesman, Gayda, published articles in newspapers in Rome and London, explaining these three demands and saying that if France did not provide appropriate solutions, Franco-Italian relations would never be repaired. His words were quite threatening to France.</p>
<p>Therefore, French Prime Minister Daladier gave a broadcast speech on the 29th, saying that France was willing to negotiate based on the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement of 1935. But France would never give up an inch of land, nor would it give up the slightest right. We know that the Rome Agreement was unilaterally abandoned by Mussolini long ago, and now that France is unwilling to give up any more land or rights outside of this agreement, it is bound to disappoint Mussolini.</p>
<p>The Rome Agreement was originally the precursor to the improvement of relations between France and Italy and the stabilization of the European situation. Before the Rome Agreement, they had always been in a position of opposition and struggle in order to compete for hegemony in the Danube River basin and for colonies in Africa. After Hitler came to power in 1933, he tried his best to expand his power into the Danube River basin. Because France and Italy were both threatened, they changed their previous policies and concluded the Rome Agreement in January 1935. The agreement stipulated that France should cede to Italy the area south of Italian Libya to the old volcanoes of Tibesti, and the area north of the Tajura Bay in French Somaliland, which is adjacent to Italian Eritrea. With this piece of land, Italy would be able to extend its power to Bab el Mandab and hold the southern end of the Red Sea, just like Britain with its possession of Aden. Secondly, France also transferred a portion of the shares of the railway from Djibouti to the capital of Abyssinia to Italy, so that it also had the right to operate the railway. In addition, France also allowed Italians in French Tunisia to retain their nationality until 1945. This means that only Italians born in Tunisia after 1945 would be subject to French law. France gave Italy these many interests in Africa, satisfying its colonial desires in Africa, with the aim of making Italy give up its ambition to compete with France for hegemony in the Danube River basin and work together to prevent Hitler's southward advance. But in fact, Mussolini not only failed to unite with France to restrain Germany, but instead colluded with Germany to engage in aggression. He helped Hitler annex Austria and Czechoslovakia, and actively presided over the Spanish Civil War. He sent volunteers to Madrid, controlled the heart of Spain, threatened British Gibraltar; and stationed heavy troops at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains, threatening southwestern France. But on the other hand, Mussolini saw that after Germany annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, its power was likely to extend into the Adriatic Sea, threatening the northern Mediterranean, which was "essential for the survival" of Italy. The excessive expansion of German power was also unfavorable to Italy. Therefore, in order to increase its power in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, it made these demands on France.</p>
<p>In the past, France always followed Britain in dealing with the demands of aggressor countries, adopting a policy of inaction and accommodation. But the result of accommodation has instead fueled the ambitions of the aggressors. This time, Italy's demands directly threaten France's lifeline. Because, first, Tunisia is in French North Africa, located on the opposite side of the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia, which is a very important military area. If it is occupied by Italy and controls the central Mediterranean, then French Algeria and Morocco will be threatened. Second, the Suez Canal is the main route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. If Italy obtains management rights, it can increase its power in the western Mediterranean. Third, Djibouti is a fortress at the southern end of the Red Sea, facing Aden across the sea. If Italy's power is strengthened there, it can control the traffic in the Red Sea and the Near East. In short, Italy's three demands are aimed at controlling France's transportation with Africa and the Near East. France's colonies are second only to Britain in size, and most of its colonies are located in Africa. Once transportation with the colonies is controlled, what is the difference between this and giving up all its colonies?</p>
<p>France has learned many lessons and been deceived by its inaction and accommodation towards aggressors. It should have been aware of this long ago. Now, in addition to expressing that it will not give up an inch of land or the slightest right, Daladier is also calling on peace-loving countries to step up cooperation to stop future aggression by aggressors. This is certainly necessary. But we hope that France's attitude can become more active and take more effective measures to punish aggressors.</p>

<p>Rangoon Large quantities of munitions are currently arriving here steadily, to be transported to China via the Burma Road. The details regarding quantity, value, and nature are unknown. The Burmese government neither hinders nor facilitates the transshipment of munitions. Therefore, the speed of transporting these munitions into China depends entirely on the ability of the Chinese transportation authorities to handle traffic matters. Various military supplies are transported by rail to the border and then by road to Kunming. The Southwest Transportation Company manages automobile transshipment, and it has now established an office in Rangoon. The Burmese government does not collect export taxes on Burmese gasoline transported via the highway. This measure is likely for commercial reasons rather than political relations, as Burma is willing to encourage China to purchase gasoline from Burma. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

The rumor circulating that Hitler will take this opportunity to announce the abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is considered unfounded by well-informed sources here.

<p>(Paris) The commercial agreement negotiated between France and Romania was formally signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 12:20 this afternoon by Foreign Minister Bonnet and Romanian Ambassador Tatarescu. The main points are to increase the volume of trade between the two countries and to stipulate that France should reduce the import tariffs on Romanian agricultural products appropriately. Ambassador Tatarescu also made a statement to the press, expressing satisfaction with the agreement. He said, "The standard of living in our country is still too low. To raise the standard of living, we must obtain a larger market for agricultural and mineral products. This is one. Our country needs foreign capital to actively develop its mining and timber industries. This is two. However, our country does not need to grant exclusive rights to others within its borders, neither in the past nor in the future. Because after a country is economically controlled by others, it will inevitably lose its autonomy politically sooner or later. We are aware of this, so the current economic policy is based on defending the country's political independence and territorial integrity. As for the commercial agreement signed between France and Romania today, it is well-received in our country and is considered the first step in international economic cooperation. The friendship between France and Romania has always been a major element of European peace, and it will inevitably become stronger after the signing of this commercial agreement." (Havas, 31st)</p>

This measure did not use "silver bullets."

Germany will never again allow its economy to depend on internationally manipulated monetary policies. Countries lacking capital will never again allow themselves to rely on others by borrowing foreign debt. They all want to strengthen their own production to strengthen the purchasing power of their people by selling products. Germany will reclaim the Deutsche Bank shares abroad from the holders and compensate them for their losses. Funk also discussed the necessity of re-establishing strong economic relations between countries, saying that the foundation of the world economy has already changed. Countries with full national power will no longer be bound by the international gold standard or international debt entanglement. (Haitong News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the signing of the commercial agreement between France and Romania, Foreign Minister Bonnet gave a statement to the newspapers, saying, "The friendly relations and cooperation between France and Romania are an important foundation for European peace, and it is gratifying that this has been expressed by this commercial agreement." He also hoped that the two countries would be able to work together more closely in the near future and achieve something. Minister of Commerce Gentin also spoke, saying, "Trade between France and Romania will be fully developed on the basis of this agreement. French commercial policy will therefore form a new trend. In other words, the quantity of goods France should purchase should be based on the size of the quantity of French goods that the other party can purchase. The economic relationship between France and Romania can be further developed through this agreement, and we often encourage investment in Romania to enhance the economic relationship between the two countries."

<p>A certain location in Shanxi Province: We crossed exhausted horses late at night and entered Qixian County in Shanxi Province, which the Japanese army had invaded twice but were ultimately forced to abandon. The next morning, the county magistrate formally met with us. He was a man in his forties, appearing very capable. His notebook contained detailed information about the city's experiences. I record the main points below:</p>
<p>The Japanese army knew that this city was an important center in Shanxi Province. Over a year ago, they crossed the mountains to invade. The residents had moved all food and valuables in advance and then abandoned the city, which is a common occurrence in Shanxi Province. However, this city still suffered losses of up to 150,000 yuan due to Japanese damage. Many houses were burned down. Approximately four hundred wounded Chinese soldiers who could not be moved in the city were stabbed to death by the Japanese army. Later, after about ten days of guerrilla attacks, the Japanese army retreated towards the railway. It was not until the Chinese army entered the city that they learned that the previously wounded soldiers had been brutally murdered by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Last December, this city was attacked for the second time. The residents took the same preventive measures, first moving the food out of the city and burying other items underground. The second loss amounted to 200,000 yuan. The Japanese army, totaling 20,000 men, advanced in three routes. The Chinese army did not put up strong resistance, allowing the Japanese army to occupy it. However, the Chinese army circled to the rear of the Japanese army and cut off their supply lines. During the Japanese occupation, they gathered nine hundred head of livestock to gorge themselves, and eighty-seven people were brutally killed by the Japanese army, including seventy-one farmers and the rest local civil servants.</p>
<p>The county magistrate then recounted a tale of courage, saying that one mile from the city, there was a precarious mountain peak that could only be reached by using a rope ladder. Nine households lived there. When they saw the Japanese army approaching and demanding food, they immediately pulled up the rope ladder. When the Japanese army tried to climb the cliff, they threw stones and furniture at them. Several Japanese soldiers died as a result. After four days of resistance, the Japanese army finally climbed up, and all the residents were slaughtered, with approximately thirty deaths. Only four young children survived, two of whom were injured and the other two pretended to be dead and escaped. Soon after, the Japanese army was forced to abandon Qixian County and retreated across the mountains starting in mid-winter. After the county magistrate recounted everything, it was confirmed by senior Chinese military officers that the Japanese army's transportation was cut off, and food was running out, so they had no choice but to retreat. The Chinese army took the opportunity to guard the mountain passes and attack the Japanese army. The Japanese army, lacking both ammunition and food, struggled to escape along the way.</p>
<p>The county magistrate concluded by saying that, according to Chinese reports, the Japanese army suffered casualties of one-quarter, including several senior officers, totaling as many as five thousand men. Before we set off again, we took a walk through the streets of Qixian County. The county is a typical small Chinese county, the city located in a narrow valley between two mountains. Approximately one-fifth of the houses were destroyed, but the farmers in the city were bustling about, and trade was booming. We often saw donkeys and horses carrying goods in single file, passing through the narrow cobblestone streets. There were many open-air stalls along the way, each surrounded by many people. These stalls were mostly set up on the ruins after the destruction and sold a wide variety of goods. Everyone seemed to be determined to continue business as usual.</p>
<p>The county magistrate also told the Reuters reporter that if the Japanese army came again, they would do the same as before, leaving an empty city and cutting off their transportation, waiting for them to have to retreat. The county government would move to the mountains a few miles outside the city to work, and when the Japanese army had left, they would move back to the city.

<p>(Berlin) German Interior Minister Dr. Frick, in a speech at a reception for the diplomatic corps and journalists last night, said that the German-Polish Minority Declaration of November 5, 1937, was unfortunately insufficient to satisfy all desires. The million German ethnic minorities in Poland have a variety of pressing issues that need to be resolved. The German government also hopes to improve the status of the 650,000 Germans in Hungary, but believes that its friendly ally Hungary will be able to take measures to satisfy the demands of the German people as soon as possible. Dr. Frick then reported on the population survey in Germany, stating that there were 300,000 Czechs in the Sudetenland and 30,000 in Vienna, but the Czechs in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia could not be regarded as ethnic minorities because they were the people of the Protectorate and their status was completely different. In addition to the aforementioned 330,000 Czechs, Germany has 113,000 Poles in the east, 40,000 Croats, 30,000 Slovenes, 100,000 Hungarians, and 5,000 to 10,000 Danes and Lithuanians each. In addition, there are 285,000 people who speak both German and Polish, totaling approximately 920,000 people. This fact makes it necessary for all ethnic minorities to enjoy natural rights, such as the Czech language schools in the Sudetenland, and the Polish community has two high schools and sixty-two elementary schools, all of which teach in Polish.

<p>(London) The interest on the Chinese 1912 loan was not paid yesterday, causing some surprise, as the general impression arising from the Chongqing telegram of March 29th was that the interest on the 1912 British and French loans, which was due on April 5th, would be paid, while interest payments thereafter would be temporarily suspended pending a decision on how to repay the debts secured by customs and salt taxes. It is said that part of the funds needed for the 1912 interest payment are already in London, but not the full amount. It is believed that this interest will definitely be paid.

<p>(Paris) President Lebrun's term will expire in early May of this year. The general election is scheduled for April 5th. Senate Speaker Janin, entrusted by the Senate parties (excluding the Socialist and Communist parties), recently met with National Assembly Speaker Herriot and visited President Lebrun, asking him to put forward his candidacy, saying that if he did so, the people would be convinced and he would surely be re-elected, eliminating the need for a competitive election, and maintaining stability in the political situation, which would be especially beneficial at a time of international tension. However, President Lebrun declined. Prime Minister Daladier is said to be planning to visit the President tomorrow to urge him again. Speaker Herriot issued a statement this morning saying that he would not participate in the election under any circumstances. Former President of the National Assembly Pu Yisheng has put forward his candidacy, saying that he will not withdraw under any circumstances.

<p>(Tokyo) According to reports from various newspapers here, citing reliable sources from Beiping, General Chiang Kai-shek is reportedly planning a large-scale general offensive in North China in the near future. Judging from the troop movements of the Chinese army, an attack will soon be launched from the south against the Japanese army along the various sections of the Longhai Railway. Simultaneously, an advance will be initiated from Xi'an Prefecture in Shaanxi towards southern Shanxi. Furthermore, the Suiyuan and Chahar regions will also become battlefields for the Chinese army's counteroffensive. The reports point out that General Chiang Kai-shek, who previously exerted great efforts to promote guerrilla warfare on various fronts, is now taking a step further by launching a general counteroffensive, with the intention of enhancing the fighting spirit of the Chinese army and increasing the belief of third countries in the combat effectiveness of the Chinese army, thereby hoping to obtain substantial assistance from Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Japanese military figures also anticipate an increase in Chinese military activities, but express doubts as to whether the current counteroffensive can truly be carried out on a large scale.

<h3 id="e46">Shanxi Army and People Unite to Resist Japan; Japanese Prisoner Says Japan is About to Go Bankrupt, and China Will Be a Merciful Victor <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Somewhere in Shanxi: In a remote village in Shanxi province, this reporter unexpectedly encountered three Japanese prisoners. All three are currently working for the Chinese army, translating political texts. This reporter was traveling with a certain division commander of the Chinese army heading to a guerrilla area. We arrived at a village in the mountains around noon and stopped to inspect it. We were then led to tour the surroundings and introduced to the Japanese prisoners. The Japanese prisoners were all dressed in light blue Chinese uniforms, indistinguishable from the other workers in the village, which has now become a political center. The Japanese prisoners seen were all Japanese farmers. A Korean interpreter provided translation. According to one Japanese prisoner, his father was a farmer. After being drafted, he was trained to drive trucks and assigned to China. The other two also said they were truck drivers and that they had been captured near Linfen in western Shanxi after getting lost. In response to the reporter's questions, they all said that the treatment by the Chinese side was very generous. When the reporter asked them to express their opinions, all three had tears in their eyes and looked down at each other for a while. One of them then mustered the courage to say, "This war is really due to Japanese imperialism. China is fighting for justice and peace." They all believe that Japan will soon go bankrupt, and China will be victorious and be a merciful victor. The Japanese prisoners also said that they all felt depressed because, according to Japanese law, soldiers are not allowed to return to their home country once they are captured. During this reporter's trip through Shanxi and Shaanxi, two things seemed particularly noteworthy: (1) the people's resolute resistance to Japan and (2) the extremely thorough methods of politically and militarily organizing the peasants. Each village has a political education center engaged in organizing meetings, speeches, and dramas, as well as posting slogans. Even in the smallest villages, the village head is assisted by the nearest larger villages in handling various tasks. These larger towns often have offices of the "Sacrifice to Save the Nation Association" and other organizations to handle this work. In addition, local self-defense corps are used to teach the people the essentials of military training, which is more systematic than before. Therefore, farmers can have thorough cooperation with regular troops. "The army and the people must unite" has become the most popular slogan in Shanxi province today. Army-people cooperation songs can be heard at any time. The reporter wanted to find a flaw in various gatherings but could not. All the people were seen to be enthusiastically engaged in various new war activities. The reporter was the first person from the press to come to this most remote area of Shanxi province, so the people all united to express their welcome and said that they were all willing to engage in arduous struggle. Local self-defense corps also automatically entertained the reporter. Some of their members were armed with spears, while others were unarmed. Currently, farmers throughout Shanxi province have very harmonious feelings towards the soldiers. The reporter once accompanied a small squad of soldiers on horseback and was warmly entertained by the farmers everywhere, who provided food and various assistance. On one occasion, we stopped to rest in the mountains, and the people living in caves there rushed to provide us with boiling water to quench our thirst and came to chat with us. When the reporter asked if they had any eggs, they hurriedly presented us with fifty, but the soldiers who were with us insisted on paying for them. The situation where Chinese farmers willingly give food to soldiers, but the soldiers insist on paying for it, is probably something that no one would have believed in the past. When the reporter needed a guide, several young people volunteered to act as guides. Once, when crossing the Yellow River, the division commander traveling with the reporter and the reporter stood side by side on the shore. The division commander pointed to the deep gorge by the river and said, "Japan may be as strong as these rocks, and China as weak as the river water, but one day we will grind this rock away just as the Yellow River does."

<p>(Chongqing) According to a telegram from the Political Department of the □th Division in Maojin, southern Shanxi, the army shot down a Japanese Type 94 bomber on the 28th. Japanese pilot Lieutenant Kiyoshi Yamada fired his gun and attempted to escape, but Fan Zengkuo, a resident of Pinglong Village, bravely rushed forward. When Yamada was loading his gun, Fan forcefully grabbed his waist. Yamada immediately struck Fan's head with his pistol, causing him to bleed profusely, but he still refused to let go. After the army arrived, Yamada was finally captured alive. Fan Zengkuo originally had no official position, but his hatred of the enemy was particularly deep. His selfless disregard for his own safety is commendable. He has already been awarded by the Military Affairs Commission in accordance with regulations, and a special commendation has been requested from the National Government. In addition, Secretary Lin of the same department managed to persuade Yamada Kiyoshi to become aware of the situation and surrender. He publicly announced the crimes of the Japanese warlords and translated Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will into Japanese. Clerk Ding of the same department encouraged the people to encircle and capture Yamada. All are models of political workers and have been given a major commendation each to encourage them. (Telegraph, 30th)</p>

<p>— Xiang Ying</p>
<p>Second Period: After our army entered, Japanese imperialism carried out extensive activities. First, they scattered leaflets everywhere from airplanes, saying that the Red Army's fight against local tyrants was the work of the Communist Party, attempting to create class conflicts and prevent the masses from connecting with us, thereby undermining our unity. However, because our army, after entering this area, proved through our actions and our battles that our army had good discipline and was safeguarding the interests of the people, the enemy's propaganda lost its effectiveness. Second, they used force to suppress the common people, preventing them from approaching us. If they didn't, they would bombard with artillery and burn houses, causing the people to beg the New Fourth Army not to come, lest their houses be burned. However, later, in places where we didn't go, they still burned and killed in the same way. The common people gradually realized that the enemy's propaganda was deceiving them. Third, there was political propaganda. The enemy, using anti-communism and anti-Chiang as a pretext, told the people that they were suffering from the disasters of war because of the Communist Party and Chiang Kai-shek, and that to seek peace, they had to oppose the Communist Party and oppose Chiang Kai-shek. The enemy's central slogan was to oppose the main force of China's resistance. This meant that after our army entered, their previous methods were no longer effective. Fourth, they adopted a gentle policy, restraining even their most barbaric actions, giving small favors to prevent the common people from approaching us.</p>
<p>Third Period: That is, the most recent developments: First, they recruited local armed forces with insufficient awareness, bad elements, and wavering loyalties to become traitors. Second, they threatened fence-sitters to stand on their side and become loyal tools of their rule. Third, they used traitors to sow discord everywhere. Fourth, they colluded with local wavering elements, not only exchanging information with them but also including them in their sphere of influence. Fifth, they reached a tacit understanding with actively attacking troops, adopting a non-aggression attitude towards each other. Sixth, they promoted anti-communist movements, such as the recent anti-communist rallies held in Nanjing and Wuhu. Seventh, the enemy recently used Chinese resources to have various factories resume production. In Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places, Japanese people came forward to open factories, allowing those capitalists with weak national consciousness to open factories and do business, seeking Japanese economic cooperation. In these places, they are implementing the dumping of Japanese goods. In this way, on the one hand, they are developing Chinese resources, and on the other hand, they are using Chinese resources to conduct the Sino-Japanese War. The enemy is launching a political offensive in this direction. Over the past year, the enemy has undergone different changes in military and political terms.</p>
<p>Second, changes in our military and political situation: First, before June, puppet organizations and maintenance societies were universally present in the Jiangnan area, and the Chinese government had very little power. Second, fence-sitters filled various places, occupying a dominant position. Third, the morale of the people in Jiangnan was low. Fourth, since the start of the war of resistance, bandits were prevalent everywhere, running rampant. Fifth, the Big Sword Society, due to the Japanese suppression and the tyranny of the guerrillas, created various obstacles. Sixth, the guerrillas had very bad discipline, desperately fighting each other to seize territory. Precisely because they were fighting each other, they had no power to fight the Japanese. This was the situation before June. Second, after our army entered, the result of several months of fighting and work was: First, except for within enemy strongholds, the puppet regime was universally abolished, and the Chinese government was universally established and restored. Second, fence-sitters disappeared. Third, bad armed units were either disbanded or reorganized. Fourth, we strived to have the Big Sword Society cooperate in combat. Fifth, people's organizations were generally established to a considerable extent. Sixth, the people's anti-Japanese morale has been greatly enhanced. These are the changes after our army entered the Jiangnan area. Third, the future trend is that the struggle situation in Jiangnan is becoming more and more tense, and the struggle is becoming more and more acute. We estimate that the future situation in Jiangnan will have a deeper development. In the more intense and difficult situation of national struggle, if there is no development of a broad mass organization, the partial defection of a few wavering elements is inevitable. Not only should the army and the people cooperate, but the military and the government must be united. To adapt to the more difficult situation in Jiangnan in the future, this is necessary. However, the current situation is that the military and the government are still separated and are even going in opposite directions. This is not suitable for future development and should be corrected urgently.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Military Strengths and Weaknesses</p>
<p>Based on the past year of combat, the enemy's strengths and weaknesses can be divided into the following points: First, the enemy's tactics: First, the enemy's tactics rely on building strongholds everywhere, constructing highways, and reducing our scope of activity. Second, converging attacks, adopting ambushes and encirclements. Third, lightly equipped advances, facilitating rapid movement and surprise attacks. Fourth, adopting ambushes, using roads to ambush our troops. Fifth, adopting concealed actions, easily discovered during the day, operating at night, making our vigilance negligent, and troops vulnerable to attack. They take small roads instead of large roads. Sixth, relying on firepower, using firepower to threaten the enemy and suppress the enemy. Second, the enemy's strengths: First, accurate shooting. Second, good at using terrain and objects to conceal their advance. Third, can swim. Fourth, rapid rescue of wounded and sick soldiers, and quick retrieval of military supplies. Fifth, tenacity. Due to the education of Bushido, the arbitrariness of warlords, and deceitful propaganda, the enemy army has cultivated tenacity in combat. In the past, they would rather die than surrender, but now the degree has decreased and is not as tenacious as before. Sixth, every action meets tactical and combat requirements. Seventh, the officers are very strong, able to control the troops, and can deploy quickly in battle. Eighth, the soldiers have strong obedience, advancing when told to advance, and retreating when told to retreat. They can regroup even after being defeated. Ninth, they have a strong ability to repair transportation routes. Tenth, they are very flexible in their use of tactics, changing them at any time. If they fail today, they will change them tomorrow. Third, the enemy's strategies to deal with us: First, they construct fortifications and build strongholds at all important transportation lines and at bends in the road. Second, they use barbed wire and guard dogs. Small rivers are crossed using movable bridges. Fourth, when marching or transporting, they use small forces to occupy prominent positions first, concealing their advance and searching ahead. Fifth, they frequently change their camping locations. Sixth, they dig trenches and gun holes in the houses they stay in. Seventh, they use waterways for transportation to prevent our attacks. Fourth, the enemy's weaknesses: First, complacency still exists, and vigilance is neglected. Second, they lack an attacking spirit. Third, their movements are clumsy and slow. Fourth, they cannot endure hardship and cannot march long distances. Quick marches and forced marches. Fifth, the failure of using traitors and the uselessness and unreliability of puppet troops.</p>
<p>Experiences and Lessons of People's Movement Work</p>
<p>Over the past year, in the front and in the rear, in order to mobilize the people and strengthen the forces of resistance, in order to achieve army-people cooperation, and with the support and help of the people, we have been able to persist in the struggle in the difficult environment of Jiangnan. Therefore, since the establishment of our army, we have been conducting people's movement work at any time and in any place. Although various objective conditions have prevented us from carrying out people's work according to our own wishes at certain times and stages, or even prevented us from doing people's work at all, such as at the beginning of the establishment of our army, from reorganization to concentration, especially during the concentration stage, we can say that we did not do people's work in order to comply with the orders of our superiors and to avoid many misunderstandings. It was not until after our troops were deployed and started fighting that we began to carry out people's movement work in our own combat areas and around our own troops. Our previous propaganda work was very limited, and it was only at this time that we began to carry it out, not only propagandizing but also moving from propaganda to organization. However, even today, there are still some people who do not understand the importance of people's work, do not understand how to achieve army-people cooperation, and not only cannot develop a superficial people's movement to achieve the development of the national salvation movement, but even do not want to have a people's movement and are jealous of others doing people's movement work. Why do we do people's movement work? For the war of resistance, in order to defeat the enemy, eliminate the enemy, and strive for victory in the war of resistance. From the perspective of the army itself, for the survival of the army, without the people, the army cannot develop, cannot grow, and will be defeated. It is agreed that under the conditions of the comparison of strength in the Sino-Japanese War, our weapons are much worse than the enemy's. Taking our New Fourth Army as an example, our weapons are even worse than those of the general anti-Japanese troops. We rely mainly on the strength and help of the people to confront the superior enemy with such inferior weapons. If there are no people, then we will not only be unable to resist the enemy, but we will also be unable to achieve victory in combat under conditions of great disparity in strength. This explains why we do people's work, why we regard this work and our survival and victory as so important, because the two are inseparable. Our people's movement in the past six months or so can be divided into three parts:</p>
<p>First, the experiences and lessons of the past six months: A. The first experience, which can also be said to be a lesson, is that the army's own practical actions are the basic conditions for gaining the trust and support of the people, and it is the foundation for starting people's movement work. I remember when our army set out from Nanchang, I gave a report to the service corps comrades on the people's movement work in the war zone. I pointed out that the first thing is to use the army's own actions as the foundation for the people's movement, because if we are an army doing people's movement work, we must first have strict discipline in order to gain the trust of the people. We think that this year, especially in the second half of the year, can further prove this point. For example, in the first half of the year, after our army concentrated and advanced towards the war zone, we did not do propaganda work. The work started after the service corps comrades arrived in the war environment and deployed. But why did many people everywhere welcome and trust us, and many people help us, so that our army gained very, very good trust among the people in southern Anhui? Because our army has very good discipline, not only good discipline, but also cherishes the people everywhere and respects the interests of the people everywhere. Therefore, although we did not have much propaganda, we were welcomed everywhere. When our army began to operate in the Jiangnan combat area, because of the Japanese army's propaganda and the propaganda during the domestic war in the past, many people did not understand us. But after our vanguard team went around once, the people of Jiangnan immediately recognized us. When the main force advanced, the people welcomed us everywhere. These facts prove this truth: army discipline is the foundation of people's movement work. The same, conversely, proves that an army with bad discipline will not be trusted by the people, even if it does a lot of propaganda. Many people think that we do not know how much money we have spent on propaganda work, but we feel ashamed of the real propaganda work. It is precisely because of the actions of our army that we can gain the trust of the people, and it is much easier to do people's movement work after that. B. Second, the victory of the battle is a necessary condition for developing people's movement work. Simply doing propaganda without fighting, or fighting badly, the people will say, "It's good, but it's useless!" In short, the reason why we have gained the support of the broad masses of people in Jiangnan and quickly developed people's movement work is largely related to our victories in Jiangnan. This is the second experience and lesson. C. Third, the united front is a prerequisite for carrying out people's movement work. In my last report, I specifically pointed out that everything must go through the united front, and only on the basis of the united front can the people be mobilized. Today we can also prove that wherever the united front is used well, the work can be greatly developed, and wherever it is worse, the work will be worse. D. Going deep among the people is an effective way to mobilize and organize the people. To organize and mobilize, it is not enough to rely on propaganda, nor is it enough to rely on slogans. These effects are very limited. You must go among the people to understand the people, to approach the people, and only on this basis can you organize and mobilize them. It is empty to think of doing people's work by simply standing above the people. We can use our experience to see that those places in the front and rear where we have not gone deep among the people, the work is still insufficient, and the mobilization of the masses cannot be carried out. This is the fourth experience and lesson. E. Fifth, pay attention to the lives of the people. This is the main condition for mobilizing the people to resist Japan, and it can also be said to be a necessary factor. To enable the broad masses of people to participate in the war of resistance, we must pay attention to their livelihood problems. If we do not try to solve their livelihood problems, then we cannot increase their enthusiasm, because this is what they feel firsthand. Let's look at the experience. In those places where this issue has been paid attention to and given a considerable solution, the anti-Japanese sentiment is different. In those places where this issue has not been taken care of, the people's movement is much worse. This is the same not only in the front but also in the rear. But we have one principle: under the highest principle of the war of resistance, we will solve the people's livelihood problem in order to promote the war of resistance, to mobilize the people to enable them to participate in the war of resistance, and to solve the suffering of the people's livelihood in the interests of the war of resistance. This is a principle, and it is also the fifth experience and lesson of our people's movement work in the past six months or so. F. No matter what people's movement, from the beginning of its launch to its continued development and in-depth development, to the consolidation of people's organizations, if many cadres cannot be promoted from among the local people and cadres cannot be trained to lead the work, this people's movement cannot be developed and the people's organization will not be consolidated. Only by promoting and training cadres from among the local people and making these cadres consolidate and strengthen the people's organizations can this be achieved. Without these backbones, it will not work. Those places that have a considerable number of cadres and have their own cadre work, the people's movement must be good. Those places that always ask others to handle it for them will not have much effect. This is an obvious fact. G. Seventh is an experience and lesson we have in terms of methods. Regarding drama and costumed speeches, these are effective methods of rural propaganda. If we have a good drama suitable for the countryside to improve their awareness of the war of resistance, it will be more effective than giving many reports. The general public has not gone to school, so we must pay attention to their level of understanding and adopt various methods. If it is like our report today, the farmers will be dizzy as soon as they hear it. We say that in the experience of fighting, those that are effective in the countryside can be said to be that speeches and slogans do not have much effect, and even artistic pictures do not have much effect. But if it is a costumed speech or a play, it is different. H. Eighth, let's analyze the people's movement work and the mobilization of the people. In those places where there is people's movement work, the mobilization of the people is easier, and those places can adapt to the needs of the war of resistance and reduce the difficulty of mobilization. In all places where there are people's organizations, mobilization is faster. The masses without organizations have insufficient political awareness, and the mobilization force is small. In short, this is a very big weakness in the war of resistance. Why can't the people be mobilized? It is because they are not organized. Therefore, we must do people's movement work, organize the people, and rely on people's organizations to meet the requirements of the war of resistance. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Guangzhou University President Chen Bingquan Discusses Impressions of Attending the National Education Conference: Conference Highlights Focus on Wartime Education <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Special Dispatch) The representatives from Hong Kong who attended the Third National Education Conference, including Chen Bingquan of Guangzhou University, Li Yinglin of Lingnan University, and Wu Dingxin of National University, have already returned to Hong Kong. President Chen Bingquan of Guangzhou University hosted a reception for the Hong Kong education community at the Swiss Hotel at 6:00 PM on the 28th to report on the conference proceedings. Thirty to forty principals from various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon attended. During the reception, Mr. Chen delivered a speech reporting on the conference, stating that the atmosphere was exceptionally good. A particular feature of this conference was the special emphasis on wartime education and raising the standards of education in border regions. Mr. Chen continued to say that the government authorities attached great importance to this conference and reported each of the important opinions he had recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Important Opinions: (1) Regarding the opinions of President Chiang, these have already been published in various newspapers and will be omitted. (2) Premier Kong, amidst his busy political affairs, personally attended the conference several times. His opinions on education can be roughly divided into: (A) The purpose of education in the Republic of China is to realize the Three Principles of the People, enrich people's lives, support social survival, develop national livelihoods, and continue the life of the nation. We must strive for national independence, universal civil rights, and the development of people's livelihoods to promote universal harmony. We should proceed earnestly toward this goal. (B) Churches are like power plants, schools are like factories, and factories are like warehouses. Therefore, school education must be based on labor and service, cultivate noble character, a spirit of sacrifice, strong physique, practical knowledge, and productive skills. (C) In addition to school mottos, we should cultivate a good school spirit to make students love themselves and others, cooperate and obey, aspire to do great things, and not aspire to become high officials. (D) Promoting Chinese culture is the greatest mission of education. (E) Education funding has gradually increased from 2% to 4%. Regarding the allocation of funds, attention should be paid to expanding equipment, but thrift should be the principle. (F) The resolutions of the first and second education conferences should be comprehensively reviewed. Which have been implemented, and to what extent? Which have not been implemented, and what are the reasons? (3) Minister Chen was the chairman of the Third National Education Conference and attended almost every meeting, expressing many opinions. In addition to those already published in newspapers, he stated that education should have a purpose, saying that we should take the realization of the Three Principles of the People as the purpose of education. In addition to the grand goal of realizing the Three Principles of the People, schools should have a smaller goal. Generally speaking, we should focus on the cultivation of practical skills. Students should develop special skills based on their individual personalities and environments to solve their own lives. In addition, other important figures such as Zhang Ji, Ju Zheng, Dai Jitao, Wang Chonghui, and He Yingqin also gave many instructions, which shows that the authorities have exceptionally high expectations for the education community.</p>
<p>Education Plan: As for the educational plan for the second phase of the War of Resistance, the following provisions have been made: (A) Secondary Education: (1) Divide school districts. From the 27th year of the Republic (1938), each province will be divided into several secondary school districts. In principle, each district will have a provincial secondary school, and each county will have a county-level junior secondary school. Schools within each district will jointly organize a secondary education research association to study various secondary school issues. (2) Revise the curriculum and standards. Convene experts to revise the hourly standards and the main points of instruction for each subject. The teaching standards promulgated in the 25th year (1936) will still be preserved. (3) Enrich equipment. (A) Establish scientific instrument manufacturing plants to supplement the equipment of various schools. (B) Formulate standards for library equipment for secondary schools at all levels. Schools must meet the minimum standards by the 29th year (1940). (4) Certify and promote teacher training. Hold no-test certification for secondary school teachers. Establish summer vacation training courses and long-term training classes.</p>
<p>Vocational Education: (B) Vocational Education: (1) Divide vocational school districts in border provinces. Starting from the 27th year (1938), divide vocational school districts in border provinces. In addition to establishing practical vocational schools, various vocational training classes will also be organized. The provincial vocational schools in other provinces will have similar training classes attached. (2) Enrich equipment. Formulate equipment standards for agriculture, industry, commerce, and women's domestic affairs, and require all schools to complete their equipment. (3) Formulate curricula and edit textbooks. Formulate curriculum standards for agriculture, industry, commerce, and women's domestic affairs, and edit textbooks within two years. (4) Student practice. Emphasize practice and establish practical production organizations, such as factories, farms, banks, and sewing and catering shops. (5) Teacher training. Designate universities to recruit graduates of senior vocational schools and provide them with four or five years of training, and reward excellent teachers.</p>
<p>Elementary Education: (C) Elementary Education: (1) Promote compulsory education. Short-term elementary schools will be gradually changed to a two-year system, and children's art and crafts classes will be established. (2) Improve elementary education. Compile main points and examples for each subject, organize children's reading materials, compile standard tests, and methods for examining grades. Formulate elementary school equipment standards and organize experimental education committees to guide national experimental education affairs. (D) Overseas Chinese Education: (1) Establish the Overseas Chinese Education Facilities Committee in the first half of the 28th year (1939), which will be organized by personnel from the Ministry of Education, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and relevant central agencies.

(3) Organize mobile teaching groups for overseas Chinese education, inviting education experts familiar with the situation of overseas Chinese education to be members of the group to give lectures overseas. (4) Establish model primary and secondary schools in areas where overseas Chinese schools are concentrated in various overseas locations. (5) Establish an overseas Chinese normal school in China or abroad in the second half of the 28th year (1939) to train teachers for overseas Chinese schools. Regarding</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Education: The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has the following plans: (1) Adjust the administration and teaching of overseas Chinese schools. 1. Standardize school administration. 2. Standardize teaching programs. 3. Formulate training outlines and discuss teaching issues. 4. Student extracurricular activities, vocational teacher extracurricular social activities. 5. Encourage staff and students to engage in anti-Japanese propaganda. (2) Subsidize overseas Chinese schools and poor students who return to China to study.

Provide appropriate subsidies to those who return to China to study and are confirmed to be poor. (3) Establish vocational schools and supplementary classes. Establish one or two vocational schools in areas with a large number of overseas Chinese, and require overseas Chinese schools to attach vocational supplementary classes in areas with a smaller number of overseas Chinese. All equipment and expenses will be subsidized by government allocations. It is planned to establish 15 to 20 vocational schools and 50 to 100 vocational supplementary classes within two years. (4) Organize overseas Chinese education branch associations in various locations. In addition to preparing for the establishment of the General Association of Overseas Chinese Education, the existing education associations in various locations will be reorganized into overseas Chinese education branch associations to unify the organization. (5) Send specialists to guide and promote overseas Chinese education. It is planned to select specialists to go to various overseas Chinese schools to conduct on-site inspections or to reside in suitable locations for a long time, providing nearby guidance and improvement and promotion. The adjustment methods include: 1. Formulate methods for sending specialists to guide overseas Chinese schools. 2. Formulate various standards for overseas Chinese schools, such as the allocation ratio of funds, the number of full-time teachers, achievement, standards, teachers, teaching materials, time, and subject standards. 3. Formulate reward methods for overseas Chinese schools above the horizontal line and support methods for overseas Chinese schools below the standard. 4. Formulate extracurricular activity methods, such as new life social services, youth sports, travel, and sports. (5) Prepare to establish overseas Chinese high schools or colleges.

<h3 id="e58">Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-City Football Match: Hong Kong Team Lineup Decided: Li Huitang Leads the Army to the Philippines on April 28th <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) In the first Hong Kong-Philippines inter-city football match held during the Lunar New Year holiday, the athletes from Manila showed their skills in Hong Kong for the first time. Due to their inferior strength, they lost to the Hong Kong inter-city team by 1 to 4, lost to the Chinese United team by 3 to 5, and lost to the Hong Kong United team by 3 to 4. The Philippine team lost all three games in Hong Kong and returned home. The purpose of the Philippine team's visit to Hong Kong for the inter-city match was on the condition that the Hong Kong General Association send a team to Manila in April as a reciprocal visit. The Philippine team has fulfilled the condition to come to Hong Kong to compete, and the date of the Hong Kong team's reciprocal visit is also approaching. At the monthly meeting a few days ago, the General Association resolved that the Hong Kong inter-city team would take the President Cleveland ship leaving Hong Kong on April 28th to the Philippines. The three games in the Philippines will be changed to return to Hong Kong on the Taiping ship. The football association authorities, with the second Hong Kong-Philippines inter-city match approaching, also urgently need to hold the selection of players for the expedition to the Philippines as soon as possible. It is heard that the General Association has selected fifteen Chinese and Western players to be players for the Hong Kong inter-city team. The Philippine Sports Association has expressed its intention to the Hong Kong General Association, requesting that Li Qigai go to the Philippines to perform, so Li Qigai and Da Gaoshan Nu are also on the list of invitees. A total of eleven starters and four substitutes were selected, and a total of seven Chinese generals were selected. However, Lie Li and Kendi of the Navy and Park Jia of the Police Association have given up their right to be selected. The rest, such as Li Qigai, Tan Junqian, Li Zhaorong, Li Tiansheng, Feng Jingxiang, Hou Chengtou, Hou Rongsheng, Army player Da Gaoshan Nu, etc., have accepted the invitation. Liang Rongzhao also replied to the General Association agreeing to represent Hong Kong in the competition in the Philippines. In order to give the inter-city team the opportunity to practice, the Hong Kong General Association took advantage of the visit of the Singapore Chinese team to Hong Kong. In the first game, the Singapore Chinese team played against the South China Club. In the second game, the General Association decided to send the Hong Kong expedition to the Philippines inter-city team to compete against the Singapore Chinese team, so that the inter-city team can benefit from cooperation, and fans can also watch a more exciting ball game, which is truly a win-win situation. The lineup of the inter-city team is recorded below.</p>

<p>Except for the second game in Group B last night, which was more intense, the other two games became one-sided. In the game between Girls' No. 2 Girls' Middle School and Zhengxin, the Industrial Girls' Middle School was strong and easily won two consecutive games with 15-1 and 15-8. In Group A, Paramount faced Fanggang A. Fanggang's lineup was not very complete, and they only relied on Guo Bingkun, who was tall. Paramount was pieced together, and Li Zhenzhong, a member of the Hualian basketball team, also came out to help, but there was no good structure. As a result, Paramount lost two consecutive games with 1-15 and 3-15. They only scored four points in the entire game, which was extremely miserable. There are a total of ten games today. In Group A, the Russian Army faces Russian Overseas Chinese A, and the Russian Army is sure to win.

<p>The formally navigable ports in eastern Zhejiang were originally Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Haimen. Since Japanese warships attempted to land at Haimen and the Jiaojiang River at Haimen was completely blockaded, the Haimen shipping route has been cut off. Now, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally notified countries such as Britain, the United States, and France that Haimen in Zhejiang has been formally blockaded, prohibiting any ships from entering Haimen, with the aim of preventing Japanese troops from landing there. Therefore, it will be difficult to resume navigation to Haimen in the short term. However, although shipping companies have repeatedly petitioned the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the [Number omitted] Group Army, requesting permission to open the Jiaojiang River, resume navigation to Haimen, or formulate alternative navigation methods, they have all been rejected by the authorities.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the chambers of commerce of various provinces and cities, stating that regarding the shipment of prohibited goods to Shanghai, which could aid the enemy, the Ministry had convened relevant agencies and agreed on review measures. Before these measures were implemented, emergency relief was temporarily permitted upon the issuance of guarantees, as previously informed by telegram. Now, the review measures for shipping prohibited goods to Shanghai, which could aid the enemy, have been announced and implemented. Hereafter, the shipment of all prohibited goods to Shanghai, within the concession areas, should be handled in accordance with these measures. The emergency relief measures stipulated in the Ministry's previous telegram should be abolished. However, requests to ship bamboo, wood, paper, charcoal, tea, and eggs to Shanghai in transit are exempt from prohibition. Attached is a copy of the review measures for shipping prohibited goods to Shanghai, which could aid the enemy. Please take note. Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>Review Measures: Review Measures for Shipping Prohibited Goods to Shanghai. (1) The shipment of prohibited goods to Shanghai is limited to the concession areas. (2) The use of prohibited goods shipped to Shanghai is limited to supply to Chinese or Allied manufacturers or to meet the daily needs of the local population. (3) When Allied manufacturers purchase various prohibited goods from the interior and ship them to Shanghai, before shipment, the chamber of commerce or trade association at the place of shipment and the Allied consulate in Shanghai should issue certificates stating the intended use of the goods in Shanghai, the names and addresses of the Shanghai manufacturers purchasing the goods, and a firm guarantee that the goods will not be used to aid the enemy after being shipped to Shanghai.

<p>Zhejiang Provincial Government Telegram: The Zhejiang Provincial Government telegraphed all counties, stating that it had approved a telegram from Commander Gu Xuan and the Xuan County Government, which stated that the Yu Hang County Self-Defense Corps Committee had telegraphed, stating that it had been reported last October that the Military Affairs Commission had issued an order prohibiting the transportation of bamboo to enemy areas. Now, the bamboo in the northern part of the county is mostly transported to Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places via Sandun, Tangxi, and Pingyao. The committee inquired whether it could be allowed to proceed. Upon investigation, bamboo is a prohibited item designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places are designated prohibited areas. Therefore, the order should be followed and transportation prohibited. The First District Local Products Transportation and Sales Conference previously held by the council stipulated that bamboo, wood, paper, and other items could be exported, which was inappropriate. Now that Yu Hang County has transported bamboo to enemy areas, other counties may inevitably have similar situations. Having telegraphed the above, it is ordered that all counties be notified to comply, etc. Approved. After investigation, in addition to shipping bamboo to Shanghai, which should be handled in accordance with the Ministry's telegram, it should be completely prohibited from shipment to the occupied war zones. It had previously been circulated for compliance. In accordance with the previous telegram, it is now telegraphed for compliance.</p>

The previous week's high was eight point two eight two five, but the weekend returned to around eight point two five. However, HSBC's listing is eight pence, and the Central Bank's listing is still at one shilling and two and a half pence, with no change.

<p>Since our country launched the national resistance against Japan, all Chinese people, without exception, have been united against the enemy, and are striving for victory with a spirit of spiritual unity. Overseas compatriots are even more enthusiastic about their motherland. In addition to remitting large amounts of materials back to the country and contributing to the government to increase the strength of the resistance against Japan, they are also investing in the development of the rich resources in the southwest. Many young people have returned home to serve. This enthusiastic spirit of supporting the resistance against Japan is a sign that the final victory will surely belong to us. The following are reports from the Modern News Agency reporter stationed in Yunnan:</p>
<p>Organizing Engineering Teams to Return Home to Serve: In order to support the motherland's resistance against Japan and strive for final victory, overseas Chinese in Singapore have recently organized a Machine Engineering Return Home Service Team. Led by General Leader Shen Daicheng, Head Wang Yousong, and Deputy Head Huang Youyi, a group of 35 people arrived in Yunnan on the 22nd and will soon transfer to Chongqing to request work assignments from the authorities.

<p>The Agreement on the Chinese Court in the Shanghai International Settlement was signed on February 17, 1930, and expired on March 31, 1933. The Agreement on the Chinese Court in the Shanghai French Concession was signed on July 28, 1931, and expired on March 31, 1933. After the expiration of the above two concession court agreements, with the consent of both parties, they were extended for three years. After the three-year extension period expires, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Britain, the United States, France, Brazil, Norway, and the Chinese governments separately notified each other with their consent, and they were extended indefinitely. However, if revisions are desired, either party should notify the other six months in advance, and we will definitely be effective.

Since neither of the signing parties has expressed any intention to establish a new agreement, and no notification has been issued before, the Chinese courts in this city will continue to operate as before, so the Chinese court</p>
<p>Sovereignty Is Not Impaired: As in the past, the Chinese court authorities have not recognized or accepted any foreign influence that attempts to modify the Sino-foreign agreement. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Concession Council have also received copies of the agreement annexes, and formally recognized the National Government as an effective signer in 1933. Therefore, the Chinese court authorities in this city will strictly abide by the provisions of the Sino-foreign agreement, pending instructions from the Chongqing Central Government, and will continue to operate as before. All rumors to the contrary can be ignored because they are all unfounded, etc. Yesterday, the reporter inquired to a certain</p>

The Japanese troops were caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. After several desperate guards were killed, they retreated in a panic. The remaining enemies surrounded in Xiaotang will be wiped out soon.</p>
<p>Tension Along the Shanghai-Minhang Line: The Shanghai-Minhang Highway is a vital thoroughfare connecting Jinghang. Since the regular troops of the Central Army advanced towards the highway, the Japanese have been extremely panicked. In addition to setting up defensive works at key transportation points, they have also mobilized the stationed troops along the Shanghai-Minhang Highway and concentrated them at Beiqiao. That place is the main place to control the Shangsong Highway and connect to South Pu. For this reason, the soldiers car is crowded with vehicles, which is nervous, and the villagers are all in fear all day long.</p>

<p>The military authorities are providing excellent post-war care for wounded officers and soldiers. The disabled are provided with life-long care for first-class disabilities. Second and third-class disabilities will be given the opportunity to engage in land reclamation, animal husbandry, gold mining, and light industry, according to their aptitude and ability, in order to increase production and increase the strength of the resistance against Japan. In addition, wounded officers and soldiers in rear hospitals, after recovering, all request to continue to return to the front line to serve the country. The military authorities commend their enthusiasm and form them into honor battalions to return to the front line. In addition, conscripts in various provinces, cities, and counties are enthusiastically participating in new recruit training, so the replenishment of soldiers is very sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="e82">New York Times Correspondent in China  Denounces Japanese Spies; Acknowledges the Rudest and Most Ignorant Organization is the Japanese Military Officer Corps <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Mainland Press reports that the editorial of the upcoming (1st) issue of the *China Weekly Review* states that the New York Times correspondent in China, Mr. Hallett Abend, recently exposed Japan's espionage system and denounced the Japanese military's Special Service Department's Kempeitai (military police) as the rudest, most ignorant, and ineptly operated armed force of its kind in the world. Mr. Abend also cited numerous Japanese military officers who admitted that his denunciations were accurate, causing the Japanese military permanent embarrassment. According to Mr. Abend, the phrase "Japanese spies," once a nationwide joke in the United States, is no longer a laughing matter, as most of China's coastal provinces and major cities have already been occupied by invaders.  Between Chinese and Japanese, the threat of espionage has evolved into an unspoken terror, and among foreigners, the frantic activities of these detectives are somewhat annoying and no longer a laughing matter. Mr. Abend believes that, apart from a few high-ranking Japanese, no one knows the details of the Japanese espionage organization and the scope of activities of the so-called Kempeitai. Mr. Abend also described the predicament many foreigners face when traveling in Japan due to spies and the Kempeitai.  He concluded that Japanese Consul General Hioki acknowledged that the Japanese Kempeitai and spies are mostly organized by rude, ignorant, and incompetent individuals.</p>

<p>Since the retreat of the National Army, bandits are everywhere in the fallen areas (now renamed guerrilla areas), committing all kinds of atrocities. Moreover, most of these bandits are local natives who are very familiar with the local situation. Residents with even a little wealth are repeatedly subjected to their exploitation. The puppet police and Japanese soldiers turn a blind eye and deaf ear, causing residents to complain endlessly. If this continues, there will be no survivors left.</p>

<p>Cao Zhangjing's unit of the Suzhou puppet "Pacification Army" was originally a gang of long-time bandits from Xiangcheng, possessing more than 300 firearms.  On March 5th, they surrendered to the puppet army's "4th District Commander" in Dongtang Township, Changshu.  The Japanese military inspected the firearms and issued them more than 100 weapons to serve as their lackeys. On March 21st, this puppet army suddenly arrived at Taiping Bridge Town in northeastern Suzhou, claiming to be searching for guerrillas, but in reality, they were looting house by house. They transported away all the grain. Furthermore, wealthy individuals from the town, such as Shen Enlin and Hua Meifeng, were also kidnapped for ransom.</p>

<p>According to the French-language *Journal de Shanghai*, the Shanghai Charity Society at 210 North Sea Road in this city specializes in burying abandoned corpses found on the roads as its charitable work. In the past year alone, it has buried 60,000 corpses found on the roads. It is now reported that its funds are exhausted. The Wusong branch of the Jianghai Customs, which has been occupied by the Japanese military for more than a year, has, after repeated negotiations, officially resumed its customs inspection duties from the previous day. However, the buildings of the Wusong branch are still forcibly occupied and garrisoned by the Japanese military, and have not yet been returned. Therefore, all Chinese and foreign customs officers have to conduct their work on customs patrol vessels. But in reality, when performing their duties, there are still various difficulties and obstacles. The Japanese military in Wusong also from time to time arbitrarily release vessels awaiting inspection, resulting in the malpractices of smuggling and tax evasion, which continue unabated. Upon hearing this report, Mr. Lofthouse, the British Tax Commissioner, has again made two demands to the Japanese side, requesting that they stop the Japanese military's unreasonable interference in the administrative work of the branch and that the original buildings of the Wusong branch be quickly returned within the shortest possible time for office use and to facilitate the exercise of its functions.</p>
<h3 id="e86">This Newspaper Continues to Present Benevolence Medals; Presented in front of the Donation Stand at the Sun Sun Department Store from Today Until Children's Day <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper, in cooperation with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, specially produced 170,000 "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badges a month ago and donated them to the association.  The association's education group then initiated a campaign, asking students in all schools in Shanghai to solicit donations from their parents for the production and education of refugee children.  Anyone who donated one yuan would receive a "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badge from this newspaper as a souvenir. At that time, all the students mobilized, and people from all walks of life eagerly contributed. As a result, in less than two weeks, more than 100,000 yuan was raised, which can be considered a special achievement. It also demonstrates that people from all walks of life are deeply concerned about the happiness and future of refugee children. The association has now announced the end of the "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badge donation campaign and will publish an accounting of the funds raised by each school as soon as possible. It will also return the remaining 40,000-plus badges to this newspaper for other fundraising purposes. This newspaper, because the 8th Children's Day is approaching soon, and in past years this newspaper has published children's publications such as "Children's Friend," which were dedicated to promoting the three aspects of children's education: moral, intellectual, and physical, and were popular for a time, believes that during this time of national crisis, relieving refugee children is a matter that brooks no delay. Therefore, from today until the 4th, Children's Day, this newspaper and the Sun Sun Department Store on Nanjing Road are jointly holding a continuation of the "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badge presentation. The Sun Sun Department Store has specially built a donation stand inside the store. Benevolent ladies and gentlemen who wish to create happiness for refugee children can go to the donation stand at the store during these four days and donate as they wish. Anyone who donates 20 cents will receive a "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badge; the more you donate, the more badges you will receive, until they are all given out. The funds will be given to the Refugee Relief Association in their entirety for the relief of refugee children. It is hoped that families with good circumstances can have their children assist in this act of kindness, so as to cultivate in them the virtue of enjoying doing good deeds and having a benevolent heart, which is indeed the fortune of society and the nation.</p>

<h3 id="e87">French Concession Health Department to Hold Large-Scale Epidemic Prevention This Summer; Last Year's Mass Vaccination Results Were Excellent <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pasteur Institute and the French Concession Health Department have investigated the results obtained from last year's epidemic prevention campaign. The following is a summary of the conclusions of the report submitted to the Far Eastern Congress of Tropical Medicine in Hanoi last November.</p>
<p>(1) In this city of over one million people, when cholera was at its most rampant, the number of cholera patients never exceeded the globally recognized average. Last year, when cholera was most prevalent, the daily average number of cholera patients did not exceed 41. The morbidity rate per 1,000 people was only 2 to 3, and the mortality rate was 0.02 to 0.03.</p>
<p>(2) The morbidity rate for the masses who received a single injection, and for the small number of people who received two injections within ten days according to medically appropriate methods, was almost zero.</p>
<p>(3) For those who had been vaccinated against cholera, but unfortunately still contracted the disease, the severity of the illness was greatly reduced, and the mortality rate was three to four times lower than those who had not been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Therefore, the results obtained in Shanghai are sufficient to prove that previous observations were correct. For example:</p>
<p>During the European Great War of 1916, when the Romanian army crossed the Danube again, they were infected with cholera by the displaced masses. Mass vaccinations were immediately carried out. Their doctor, Gangda Gusen, recorded the following:</p>
<p>The results of the vaccination were excellent. The danger of cholera spread by refugees from the Dobrogea region was completely extinguished within a few days. In the following weeks, although there were still cholera patients in Moldavia, the disease was immediately eliminated by isolating the patients and carrying out mass vaccinations on the local population.</p>
<p>The French Concession Health Department plans to carry out the same mass vaccination this year. If residents can cooperate fully, their goal will definitely be achieved. Therefore, to prevent cholera, attention must be paid to:</p>

<p>After Qibao Township in western Shanghai was recovered by the 2nd Battalion of the Directly Subordinate Force of the Loyal National Salvation Army under Yao Youlian, the merchants and residents of the town once again saw the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. However, at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, a large group of more than 200 Japanese and puppet troops suddenly attacked from three directions: Sijing, Xinzhuang, and Hongqiao. Xu, the company commander of Yao's unit stationed in the town, had already learned of this, and because of the disparity in strength, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, he led his troops to retreat to the nearby countryside. After the Japanese troops arrived in the town, they immediately declared martial law, cut off traffic, set up machine guns at the entrances of various streets and alleys, and assigned sentries to guard them. The situation was serious, as if facing a major enemy. They then searched the shops and residences, but found nothing. It was not until about 5:00 PM that they returned in formation. They came again at 10:00 AM yesterday, but the situation was more relaxed than before. Several villagers were severely beaten by the Japanese soldiers for not carrying their citizen ID cards. They were only released after various shops provided guarantees. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the Japanese and puppet troops still retreated to their original defenses in three directions.</p>

<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, the British light cruiser HMS Cardiff arrived in Shanghai from Weihaiwei last night (30th) and berthed at the British naval pontoon, replacing the British warship HMS Duncansby, which left Shanghai for Weihaiwei a few hours earlier. Sixty-eight selected British naval personnel of all ranks arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong by ship yesterday. About half of them boarded HMS Duncansby before the ship weighed anchor, and the rest boarded HMS Cardiff last night.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Cholera Prevention <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Cholera is a gastrointestinal disease. If the normal function of the digestive organs is disturbed, it provides an opportunity for bacteria to develop, and cholera occurs as a result. Therefore, when the disease is about to occur, absolute attention must be paid to food hygiene. Do not drink unclean water; it is best to boil it before drinking. Do not drink excessive or excessively cold liquids, as they can damage the antiseptic effect of gastric secretions. Do not eat raw vegetables or fruits that have not been disinfected by soaking them in potassium permanganate solution for a long time. Do not eat fruits that have been cut open and sold, or food that has been prepared for a long time or has spoiled. Pay attention to your own cleanliness and that of your neighbors, as cholera is transmitted by unclean hands. Also pay attention to the cleanliness of your own house and neighborhood, as various dust and garbage can allow flies to breed, and flies will transmit cholera bacteria everywhere. In addition, you should also get a cholera vaccination.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Rumor Spreads That Commander Xiong Jiandong of the Six-County Guerrilla Force Has Been Killed; After Being Arrested by a Certain Party, He Was Coerced and Enticed; Xiong Displayed Valor and Righteousness and Gave His Life Generously <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Xiong Jiandong, commander of the guerrilla forces of the six counties of Qin, Tai, Jia, Song, Jin, and Qing under the Special Operations Corps of the Chinese Military Commission, after being appointed, led his troops to station themselves in the Jiangnan area. His soldiers were all elite and good at fighting, invincible in all directions, traveling thousands of miles, and repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese military. Therefore, those who plotted against him became increasingly desperate. A month ago, when Xiong came to Shanghai for some important business, the secrecy was extremely tight; even Xiong's closest friends did not know his whereabouts. But he was betrayed by some unscrupulous, insane elements who were in league with a certain party, who discovered everything about Xiong and then devised a way to deceive him. At that time, Xiong trusted them completely because they were all trusted confidants, and so he was lured and arrested, and there was no news of him. Later, there was once a rumor that Xiong would be released soon, but soon the facts proved that this rumor was absurd and unfounded. According to reliable sources yesterday, it was reported that Xiong had been killed in Hongkou the day after his arrest. At that time, the other party had repeatedly tried to entice and coerce him, but all were firmly rejected by Xiong. Even when tortured, he remained brave and unyielding. The other party, running out of tricks, killed him. However, Xiong regarded death as returning home, calmly went to his death, and shouted "Long live the nation!" and died with a smile. Since hearing this shocking news, all circles have mourned in unison, calling Xiong a model of a modern revolutionary soldier.</p>

<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, citing the French-language *Journal de Shanghai*, Chinese people in Yantai have been banned from entering French churches there since March 23 because the police suspected that the church was conducting anti-Japanese propaganda and took this action. Furthermore, printing workers at the church were accused of printing anti-Japanese leaflets and were sentenced to death. The puppet government in Yantai, assisted by the Japanese military, searched house to house in the city, as they believed that a large number of guerrillas were living there. More than 300 Chinese people suspected of being guerrillas were arrested.</p>

<p>According to the Mainland Press, responsible sources reported last night (30th) that a team of searchers from the Public Concession Police Department searched a room in a New World Hotel on Yu Zhiqing Road yesterday afternoon in search of bandits. They were slightly surprised to find two Chinese and one Japanese there. But the constables still carried out their duties and began to search the three men. The Japanese man refused to be searched and called the Japanese Military Police headquarters. Soon, Japanese military police arrived, and the constables handed the Japanese man over to them. It is said that the two Chinese were searched, but they were released. As of last night, it was still not known for sure.</p>
<h3 id="e94">A Gambler Ruined by Gambling; Fiancé Willing to Engage in Degrading Behavior; Taken to Court by His Future In-Laws; Acquitted Due to Insufficient Evidence <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zheng Hong (age 33), a doctor from Huzhou residing at 60 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, became engaged to Yin Rongqiu, a woman from Hubei currently residing at 37 Yinhua Lane, Robert Dollar Road, in the Public Concession, in March 1938. Because Dr. Gu often went to gambling dens in Caojiadu to gamble, he pawned his jewelry and clothes and lost everything to the gambling den. When Ms. Yin's parents learned of this, they were very dissatisfied with this fiancé. With Ms. Rongqiu's consent, they retained a lawyer to send a letter to Gu Zheng Hong, stating that his character was base and he was willing to engage in degrading behavior and ruined his family through gambling. They intended to submit a petition to the First Special District Court to dissolve the engagement. After receiving the letter, Gu had several quarrels with the woman's parents, and so far the engagement has not been formally dissolved. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Gu Zheng Hong went to Yinhua Lane, Robert Dollar Road, and happened to meet Ms. Yin and her mother, Yin Wei, and they had a big argument and dispersed. After a while, the mother and daughter reported to the Putuo Road police station, accusing their fiancé, Dr. Gu, of snatching Ms. Yin's gold ring worth 34 yuan, etc. At about 7:00 PM in the evening, the woman's father, Yin Zonglian, grabbed Gu on Robert Dollar Road and called a Chinese constable from No. 3185 to take him to the police station for detention. This morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, explained the case, saying that the defendant had confessed to snatching Ms. Yin's gold ring at the police station. However, among the pawn tickets found on him, there was no ticket for this gold ring, etc. Then Ms. Yin and her parents testified again and questioned the defendant, who firmly denied the charges. Judge Jiang Shuzi, believing that the evidence in this case was insufficient and the circumstances were complicated, declared Gu Zheng Hong not guilty and released him in court.</p>

<p>Pi Bingzhang, a Chinese detective in the Xinzha police station, previously arrested three bandits, Li Yutang, Zhang Yixian, and Tang Abao, and found that they were related to the robbery of more than 20,000 yuan from Pan Sansheng's house at No. 10, Lane 126, Kainar Road, and 1,500 yuan from Lu Gongqing's house at No. 10, Lane 51, Xintangjia Lane. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. This morning, Judge Xiao sentenced Li Yutang and Tang Abao to ten years in prison each, and Zhang Yixian to seven years in prison. Because Li and Tang were involved in another case in the French Concession, they were ordered to be transferred to the Special Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Wang Dazhong, a foreman at the French-owned Electric Power Company, lived at No. 1, Sanxing Lane, Rue du Père Huc. His wife had passed away early, and he cohabited with Chen Lian Gui (35 years old) from Huzhou. They had a daughter, now 11 years old. Wang's first wife had a son, who was now 30 years old. He also worked as a coppersmith at the Electric Power Company and had married a local woman, Jin (25 years old). The whole family lived together. There were often disputes within the family. Unexpectedly, Wang Dazhong died suddenly of illness on the second day of the first lunar month this year. Chen Lian Gui lost her support, and the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law often led to quarrels, to the point where they were irreconcilable. On the 28th of this month, Chen suddenly led two people and took advantage of the fact that no one was home to move 18 bolts of Xiangyunsha silk, 400 yuan in cash, a white leather suitcase, and a radio set that were stored in the house. On the 30th, she went to move more items and was discovered by her daughter-in-law, Wang Jin, who reported it to the French police station, accusing Chen and others of theft. After receiving the report, the police ordered detectives to arrest Chen Lian Gui, Chen Arong (28 years old, from Ningbo), who ran a coal store at No. 79 Kangti Road, Sun Liangkui (30 years old, from Chongde), who ran a coal store at No. 50 Pei Shao Nai Road, Yu Yonggen (29 years old, from Changzhou), the owner of a engraving shop at No. 57 Rue Brenier, and Song Shuxiang (26 years old, from Henan), the owner of a teahouse at No. 152 Kangti Road. They also recovered 18 bolts of Xiangyunsha silk from No. 360 Caishi Road. After investigating at the police station, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday. Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, stated that the investigation of this case was not yet complete and requested a postponement. The defendants also retained lawyers Zhu Dianqing and Wang Kanghou to defend them in court. Judge Liao reviewed the testimony and postponed the hearing to April 5.</p>

<p>Since the Chinese army withdrew to the west, the economy of Pudong has relied entirely on the adjustment of agricultural products such as cotton, rice, and wheat. Recently, the Yuanxingde, Xiangshun, and Hemao cotton ginning factories in Daduan, Zhoupu, Zhangjiangzha, and other places ginned cotton into padded clothing and transported it to Shanghai. When they arrived at Baiyunjing Port, they were intercepted and confiscated by the Japanese military. There were thousands of dan in total, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Pudong economy is in a state of panic. It has been found that the above-mentioned "passes" for the cotton transported from the interior were all issued by Inoue, the Japanese instructor in Chuansha, for a large sum of money. Therefore, after being confiscated, when they negotiated with Inoue, he refused to take responsibility. Last year, the Pudong cotton was once attempted to be controlled by Yun Jiusheng and others, but it was not completely successful. This time, the arbitrary detention and confiscation is rumored to be due to the uneven distribution of expenses. However, the people are suffering.</p>

<h3 id="e98">International Race Club's New Venue Opens Today; "Gymkhana" Race Scheduled for April 16; Members and Non-Members May Register to Participate <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>It is said that the venue recently arranged by the International Race Club is scheduled to open on the afternoon of April 1 (Saturday) at 2:00 PM for the use of the club's members. The venue is located at 181 Hongqiao Road, not far opposite Zhongshan Road. It is a five-minute car ride from the last French soldier post on Hongqiao Road. Transportation is very convenient. Inside the venue are three tracks surrounding the lawn, where spectators can stand and have an unobstructed view of the races. There is also a building with a bar inside. In addition to the main entrance leading to the lawn and the building, there is another entrance on Hongqiao Road dedicated to the entry and exit of horses and grooms. There is also a door leading directly to the fields, so that riders can avoid the inconvenience of going around the avenue. All club members holding a 1939 pass can enter the venue after presenting it. However, the obstacle course is only for members who have paid a special membership fee and wear enamel badges. If the weather is fine, the venue is scheduled to officially open on April 16 (Sunday). At that time, the International Race Club will hold a "Gymkhana" style horse race. The order is as follows: (1) Single Pony Jumping Race. The height of the participating ponies must not exceed 14 hands. If the height of the horse exceeds the limit by no more than one inch, it will not be counted. This competition is open to both male and female members and non-members. (2) Mixed Male and Female Horse Jumping Race. Each group has one male and one female. The competition group and conditions are the same as in the first event. (3) Various Games. Professional riders are not allowed to participate in the day's competitions. There is no charge for those who register to participate. The registration deadline is noon on Tuesday, April 11. Those who wish to participate in the first and second events are requested to send their names to Mr. Cadant, secretary of the club, at the French Consulate General, or Mr. Arnold of Butterfield &amp; Swire, and must state the name of the horse, the height of the horse, and the name of the horse owner. As for those participating in the games, please contact the venue. The authorities at the Yu Garden were willing to lend their lawn to the club for use, but because this year is the time for lawn repair, it could not be fulfilled as desired. Therefore, it is not possible to organize a race in the spring as it was on November 20 last year. The "Gymkhana" race on April 16 cannot be regarded as equivalent to a formal horse race, but the club is very willing to choose a date to re-perform these simple games to entertain the audience. Although the form of the horse race is simpler, its interest and elegance are not diminished as a result.</p>

<p>Chuan Linggen, 40 years old, from Pudong, worked as a boatman. Yesterday afternoon at about 6:00 PM, Chuan went to Xujiahui for some business. Unexpectedly, when he was passing near Du Jiaxiang in the Chinese area, he was suddenly shot in the back by bandits there. He was seriously injured. At that time, Chuan struggled to escape into the concession and went to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because the hospital saw that Chuan was a gunshot wound victim, it reported to the Laoza police station as a matter of routine. The police chief immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the hospital to question Fu. Fu gave the same account as before. The police station is currently investigating. Zhang Dongshi, Zhang Minshi, and Shen Fusheng sold Tan Azhen, a 17-year-old woman from Changzhou, to Chen Axiao, the owner of the White Palace Escort Agency at No. 8 Huile Lane, Yunnan Road, for 480 yuan, forcing her to work as an escort girl and have sexual relations with guests. The case was uncovered by the Xinzha police station, and the above-mentioned people were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation.

<h3 id="e102">Spring Poem (1) <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Long a sojourner on Shanghai's shore,</p>
<p>Clothed and fed, yet ever in need;</p>
<p>Youthful days swiftly passing by;</p>
<p>Vitality fading year by year.</p>
<p>My wife's beauty rivals the flowers,</p>
<p>Yet distance keeps us apart, uncherished,</p>
<p>Now I take Bu Ti Kang to restore my frame,</p>
<p>And our deep affection shall surely remain!</p>
<p>Statement: The poetry and prose mix of advertising was pioneered by Mu Xing.</p>
<p>See previous "Spring Boudoir Lament"</p>
<p>Based on daily experience, it is known that there are two major reasons for the consumption of human energy: one is self-indulgence and debauchery, and the other is excessive and complicated work. The former is a bad habit often fallen into by young people who do not cherish themselves, and the latter is unavoidable for young people who work hard. Living on this isolated island with the highest standard of living, we feel the pressure of life and the panic of economic hardship, and we have to strive to solve our livelihood problems. Because of the excessive mental exertion, the nerves gradually weaken, resulting in neurasthenia, which is common.</p>
<p>After neurasthenia, seminal emission is unavoidable. If it occurs too frequently and for too long, the scope of weakness will gradually extend to sexual function, leading to premature ejaculation and kidney deficiency, and the joy of youth will be completely lost!</p>
<p>To thoroughly understand the origin of sexual dysfunction, the aforementioned self-indulgence and debauchery are also major causes of this condition, and the principle is the same as undertaking excessive labor. The function of sexual organs cannot be neglected nor indulged in; neglect and indulgence are both harmful, but the harm from indulgence is greater. Therefore, after indulgence, the youth glands are greatly weakened, and love is difficult to generate during sexual intimacy. Women with weak temperaments will inevitably divorce their husbands, and feel that their lonely and miserable lives are dull. Therefore, for the sake of happiness, early treatment is the best course. If you do not follow the doctor's instructions and indiscriminately take aphrodisiacs on the market, as well as "tonics" similar to aphrodisiacs, not only will they have no effect, but they will also worsen the condition. Only after taking the German genuine and potent animal testicular essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang," can energy be revitalized and sexual function invigorated in a very short period of time, promoting metabolic function and instantly curing symptoms such as insomnia, forgetfulness, back pain, loss of appetite, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, impotence, and infertility. Those who usually feel neurasthenia will become energetic. Couples whose love has faded will also reconcile as before. This is why "Bu Ti Kang" is highly respected by both the medical and pharmaceutical fields, far beyond what inferior drugs can compare with. The female "Bu Ti Kang" can promote breast development and regulate menstruation, with miraculous effects. Yang Daonan, graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Rifts in the Berlin-Rome Axis <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>To say that the Berlin-Rome Axis is about to break is, of course, premature. However, I say that the Berlin-Rome Axis already has cracks, which is an undeniable fact. We might as well use a few recent events to prove the existence of these cracks:</p>
<p>Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, and Italy did not send a congratulatory telegram, this is the first. Germany demanded commercial rights from Yugoslavia, but Mussolini's speech asserted Italy's control in the Adriatic Sea, this is the second. Italy made demands on France, and although Germany volunteered to be the backing, Italy no longer put forward the cession demands of Nice, Savoy, and Corsica, but only raised the transportation issues of the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, as well as the treatment of Italians in Tunisia, this is the third...</p>
<p>In addition, Germany annexed Austria, and the German and Italian territories were connected, causing Italy to feel threatened; Germany monopolized Romania's economic interests, excluding Italy;... All of this shows that Germany's power is unparalleled, while Italy is confined to a corner, unable to catch up. Italy's outward development and striving to be the best are certainly things that should be done, but to say that she has no desire to compete with Germany and is willing to be subservient at Germany's feet is not necessarily true.</p>
<p>This is just talking about the present; if Hitler's ability to settle old scores is indeed accurate, he must still be able to calculate these two things: first, during the European War, Italy was originally an ally of Germany and Austria, but later joined the Entente halfway, weakening the power of the Allied powers and causing Germany and Austria to collapse faster; second, at the end of the European War, Italy annexed several Austrian territories, and even now, there are still hundreds of thousands of Germans in these places. If Hitler, in his interest in settling old scores, calculates these two accounts again, what will be the result? Italy betrayed the alliance in the past, and how can it be guaranteed that it will not betray the Axis now or in the near future and join the democratic front?</p>
<p>The old cracks are deep, and new cracks continue to appear. The reason why this axis can still be maintained is only because they still have some intention of using each other. If there is only one-sided use; if the democratic front is tightly knit, making it impossible for them to use each other; if the divisive effect of Britain and France is still as effective as it was during the European War, then this axis will break immediately, not just adding some cracks.</p>
<p>Now, the time of breaking seems to be still very early; but the world is ever-changing, who can say for sure; in addition, if it is attacked day by day, it will eventually break quickly one day!</p>

<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>"Hum——"! Airplanes kept circling in the sky above. From time to time, there were also "Boom! Boom!" sounds of bombs, followed by the sound of houses collapsing, a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>Everyone uneasily climbed out of their dog-kennel-like quilts and squeezed to the door, vying to look out through the five-inch square hole. The corridor was dark and gloomy, and even the prison guards who usually shouted and yelled were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>"Where are they! Where are they! Bastards! Where did you crawl into that tortoise hole! In the past, shouting and yelling, it was all your world, now you can slip away? Damn it!" The robber A Xu slammed the door fiercely.</p>
<p>"I heard from Gou Er (prison guard) that the fighting outside has been fierce these past few days, not far from here! What to do!" The thief Wang Awan said worriedly to himself.</p>
<p>"Hum——! Boom! Boom!" Airplanes were dropping bombs again.</p>
<p>"Amitabha, bombs have eyes, don't drop them here! Spare this old dog's life! Alas! Alas!" The opium dealer Shi Lao Si said crying, then put his head back into the quilt.</p>
<p>"If you're going to be bombed, then bomb to death you kind of thieves who do things that kill people without spilling blood! I, A Xu, fight with guns, straightforwardly, white knife in, red knife out! If you're going to die, you die, do you have this kind of spirit? Ur!" A Xu said fiercely.</p>
<p>"I die, see if you don't die. Alas, alas!" Shi Lao Si crawled out of the quilt, but shrank back in again.</p>
<p>"You say it! You say it! I'll beat you to death first." A Xu wanted to rush over and start fighting, but Wang A Cai and another thief, Ma Xin Gen, held him back.</p>
<p>"Old brother, why bother arguing with this old man!" Wang A Cai persuaded A Xu, and then turned back to Ma Xin Gen and said, "Gou Er also said that the higher-ups are going to release us!"</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of death! But if I'm going to die, I have to die quickly, fight with the Japanese devils, die with face, if I'm going to be bombed to death in prison by the Japanese soldiers in a muddle, what words will I use to explain to Yama, and my fierce and ruthless father?" A Xu muttered to himself, then he slammed the door again, scolding, "Bastards! Open the door!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of hurried footsteps came from the corridor. A Xu looked out from the hole and saw Gou Er leading the way, followed by seven or eight soldiers, walking over. He couldn't help but burst into scolding, "Bastard, you're here! I thought you drowned in the tortoise hole! Open the door, let me go fight with the Japanese devils!" After saying that, he slammed the door fiercely again.</p>
<p>"Don't make trouble: don't make trouble! The warden is here to release you dogs!"</p>
<p>Gou Er said this loudly, and almost every prison cell heard it clearly. The prisoners were so happy they couldn't close their mouths! Everyone was busy, anxious.</p>
<p>After a while, the warden came. Followed by several soldiers.</p>
<p>"Number fifteen, sixteen; number thirty..." The warden read from the book, Gou Er opened the chains, and Chen Liangcai counted the people.</p>
<p>More than a thousand prisoners filled the entire corridor. The warden stood on a stool at the exit and said loudly, "The war outside is very urgent, and the enemy is not far from here. I have received orders to release you! Some of you have been here for ten or twenty years, some for three or five years, and everyone has been living in accordance with the rules. The country has not treated you badly either. Now that you are released, I hope that after you get out of prison, you can reform and start anew, and not commit crimes again! Be a good person! Be worthy of the country and your ancestors! Alright! Go! Don't push when you go out, don't be chaotic, don't crowd together, the enemy's planes will see you and drop bombs!"</p>
<p>Ah! More than a thousand cheers came from the bottom of their hearts, and then everyone started to move their feet. Just then, A Xu took a step forward and said loudly:</p>
<p>"Wait a minute! I, A Xu, also have a few words to say: I, A Xu, used to be a robber! Black guns, white knives, red blood, I've played with them all. I should have died dozens of times! But now I'm still alive. I've been sitting here for thirteen years, every tile, every brick, I can remember them all. The country has fed me for thirteen years, and has not treated me badly. In the past, we were most ungrateful to the country! Now, what should we use to repay our country? Our old homes have been destroyed by the Japanese devils, the fields have turned into barren hills, our wives and daughters have been raped, what home is there! Let's fight with the Japanese devils! Kill one, it's worth it! Kill two, get one free! Those who have the guts, follow me, A Xu!"</p>
<p>"I'm in! We're in! Me too!" Hundreds of iron-like roars.</p>
<p>A Xu led the way, followed by hundreds of brave men. An iron team, an iron torrent, went out of prison!</p>

<p>In spring, that gentle god, like a gentle breeze, sends me into the sea of dreams!</p>

The end of the sea of dreams is a terrible world, thunder, rain, and storms stir up waves, like mountains, the boat can't stop, the big fish in the sea, open their blood-basin-like mouths, devouring everything!</p>

<h3 id="e117">On Writing Biographies of National Heroes <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>The writing of biographies of national heroes is now considered very necessary by everyone, because on the one hand, it can not only promote the national personality expressed by our ancestors, but also inspire our descendants today to have a proper understanding of the nation. This kind of writing, of course, is aimed at the general public, so its writing, first, should use words that the public can understand, and cannot just copy some from ancient history; second, it must be compiled based on reliable materials, and cannot distort the materials, such as adding unnecessary mythical stories to fictional novels; third, it must be accompanied by brief annotations, such as place names and official names, so as to avoid readers feeling estranged after reading. Recently, I have been collecting some materials in this area, but unfortunately, I feel that there are some shortcomings in them. I dare to express my humble opinions and discuss them with the readers.</p>
<p>First, what I mean by using words that the public can understand is no longer a problem in the books of national heroes that have already been published. Only the Commercial Press's "Juvenile Series" is still written in classical Chinese, which is because the publication date was still in the early years of the Republic of China, so it is no wonder. However, like the two books "Wen Tianxiang" and "Shi Kefa" written by Yi Junzuo (New Life Publishing), the dialogue part still quotes the original text without translation, which is really inappropriate. For example, in "Wen Tianxiang," the examiner Wang Yinglin looked at Tianxiang's examination paper and said to the emperor: "This paper has the ancient righteousness of a tortoise mirror, and the loyal liver is like iron and stone." "Loyal liver like iron and stone" may still be understood, but "ancient righteousness of a tortoise mirror," how can the public understand it? However, it is indeed very difficult to translate classical Chinese into vernacular, so I think that in this kind of place, we only write the general meaning, and do not necessarily have to translate it according to the original text. At the same time, when writing in the vernacular, it should not be too literary, such as Wu Shutian's "Yue Fei" (Children's Publishing), which begins with writing about the sun and crows, which is quite poetic, but this is not of interest to the general public. Moreover, the story itself is earth-shattering, so I think it is better to get straight to the point and start the show lively. This kind of poetic environment cannot arouse the reader's emotions. Just like a war drama script, the opening is a beautiful garden scene, it always feels a bit out of place!</p>
<p>Second, what I mean by must be compiled based on reliable materials, this was not a problem. However, the problem lies in the fact that even with reliable materials, there are still places where there are misunderstandings. For example, in Zhang Yiping's "Wen Tianxiang" (Children's Publishing) in the "Escaping from Jingkou" section, it says: "Tianxiang followed the Yuan army all the way, passing Qiantang by boat, and seeing the picturesque scenery of West Lake, he couldn't help but feel sad and shed tears like rain. Later, he passed Wumen and arrived at Jingkou." According to the fact that Tianxiang was at the Yuan camp at Ting Mountain north of Lin'an (now Hangzhou) at the time, and was forced to go north by Boyan, this journey actually went north along the Grand Canal, so he passed Wumen (now Suzhou) and arrived at Jingkou (now Zhenjiang). Since he started from the north of Lin'an, how could Tianxiang see the "picturesque scenery of West Lake" again? There is no such person as Bi Wu in the Song History, but Zhang Jun mistakenly pulled him in. Also, in the same section, it says, "The person who supervised Tianxiang was named Wang Qianhu." An Qianhu is the name of an official weaving, not a name, this is also a misunderstanding, which is very different from the original meaning. Also, like Yi Junzuo's "Wen Tianxiang," there are also similar errors, such as saying: "In the first year of Zui Ding, the court appointed him as the Jiedushi of the Zhennan Army." According to Liu Yueshen's Biography of Prime Minister Wen, it originally said: "He was appointed as a judge in the office of the Ninghai Army Jiedushi. Tianxiang wrote a letter begging to kill Dong Songchen, but it was not reported, so he resigned and returned. He was transferred from his previous position to the Zhennan Army." That is, the Zhennan Army was also a judge in the Jiedushi's office, not a Jiedushi. Moreover, this was not a conferment of nobility, but just a dismissal from office, and cannot be called a "conferment." Furthermore, in Wu Shutian's "Yue Fei," in his "Battle of Dongting Lake," he mistakenly wrote "Zhang Jun" as "Zhang Jun," which can be said to be extremely negligent. I don't know that Jun and Jun were originally two people, how can they be confused? Also, Zhang Jun was the commander of all the armies at the time, and Yue Fei was just a general. To use today's situation as an analogy, one is the commander-in-chief, and the other is the army commander. The army commander naturally has a hierarchical relationship with the commander. However, when Wu Jun wrote about Yue Fei speaking to Zhang Jun, it was: "No need, you just need to order to keep the troops for eight days, and I guarantee that I will pacify Dongting Lake." According to Yue Fei's original biography in the Song History, it said: "Already has a decision. The commander can stay a little longer, and the bandits can be broken in less than eight days." Clearly, he was addressing the commander and not using "you," but she changed it to a "you" word, which is directly like an order, which is really not the tone of speaking to a superior.</p>
<p>Third, what I mean by must be accompanied by simple annotations is because the names are different in ancient and modern times, and it is difficult for the public to understand without annotations. For example, in the section where Yue Fei attacked Li Cheng, Li Cheng left a general to invade "Hongzhou." This Hongzhou does not exist on the current map. If we add an annotation "that is, Nanchang, Jiangxi today," wouldn't it be easier for readers to understand? Also, as mentioned above, Wen Tianxiang was the "judge in the office of the Ninghai Army Jiedushi," and there is no such official name now. We might as well simply say that it is an official in charge of documents and accounting. Unfortunately, most of the books we have seen do not take these into account, especially the official names, which are not annotated.</p>
<p>The above is only my personal opinion. The books listed are just random examples. If there is anything presumptuous, please forgive the original authors and readers!</p>

<h3 id="e118">April Fool's Day Passes <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>April 1st is "April Fool's Day," which has spread from Europe and the United States to China. It can also be said to be "Rumor Day," because everyone on this day, taking advantage of their happiness, may as well fabricate some rumors to fool their friends for fun. Fortunately, the festival is called "April Fool's," and even if friends love your deception, they will laugh it off and not take it seriously.</p>
<p>In the past, on every "April Fool's Day," the jokes of fooling and being fooled in European and American societies were too numerous to describe. Even in China, in addition to friends showing off their skills in deceiving friends to decorate this Westernized festival, several newspapers also fabricated rumors on this day. For example, when Mei Lanfang went to the United States to perform and was about to return home, the Ta Kung Pao took advantage of April Fool's Day to create a fake telegram saying that Mei Lanfang had returned to Shanghai. This news harmed two Japanese reporters, who hurriedly sent telegrams to report to Tokyo. A newspaper called the Commercial Daily in Guangzhou also published a news story on April Fool's Day saying that Ruan Lingyu was not dead. Some newspapers in Shanghai saw it and actually believed it to be true, and hurriedly reprinted it, and some even published special editions and extras.</p>
<p>However, this year's "April Fool's Day" is bound to be different from the past. Among friends, of course, no one will be willing to use this kind of boring deception to make fun of others. Newspapers bearing the responsibility of reporting, in this great and solemn period, will no longer have this kind of leisurely mood. However, only in this great and solemn period, we are actually spending "April Fool's Day" almost every day, and we should be cautious and careful every day to guard against the fooling tricks that people are constantly showing. Isn't that so? In order to put our nation in a place of eternal destruction, but force alone cannot work, and it has even proved to have failed, so they rack their brains to spread many rumors and show all kinds of fooling tricks, hoping to fulfill their wishes. Also, because their rumors are the crystallization of those conspirators, if we are not careful, we may be deceived by them. I am afraid that we should be as cautious about these rumors as we are about "April Fool's Day," and under calm observation and precise analysis, we should strengthen our confidence and answer them with an unyielding attitude, so that they have no way to show their fooling tricks!</p>
<h3 id="e119">"General Review"? <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ren Zhi</p>
<p>Thoughts on Reading "The Low Tide of Shanghai Theater Movement"</p>
<p>Mr. Lvg Kang published an article "The Low Tide of Shanghai Theater Movement" in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, with the subtitle "General Review of the Visibility Altar in the Isolated Island." The article is quite long and contains a lot of political jargon. However, after only two issues, all the theater people in Shanghai could no longer stand it. The reason is not that they do not accept the "general review," but that they regret that the basis of the so-called "review" is not fact, but fabrication; the corrections and criticisms are not only empty, but also form framing, and flow into defending the evil forces that bind the Shanghai theater movement. The use of political jargon has also become his own flaunting and the hats he puts on others. Mr. Li Jianwu only read the two issues published on February 28 and March 1, and already felt "the need to correct it immediately," pointing out six factual corrections. (1) "The Shanghai Art Theater is not a branch of Qingdao, let alone orthodox" (2) "No so-called popular writer (referring to Mr. A Ying) has been found in the Shanghai Art Theater to be doing "any manipulation" (3) "The Shanghai Art Theater has never interfered in Xiao Feng's affairs" (4) "There are also former members of the amateur experimental theater group in the Shanghai Art Theater. Mr. Lvg Kang should not create incidents to provoke the feelings of amateur theater groups who are engaged in arduous work in the mainland and isolated island theater people" (5) "The fatal injury of the Shanghai Art Theater lies in external destruction and failure to obtain registration permission, and the difficulty of registration is a common experience for all theater groups, and there is no need to speculate wildly. As for external destruction, there are two pairs of connected threatening letters. (Mr. Lvg Kang denies the external evil forces and defends them. I don't know what the argument is) (6) "The Xiao Feng incident is a mystery. The list published in the Da Wan Pao is the investigator: this has nothing to do with the political morality of the isolated island theater people, and cannot be talked about as "regrettable." Finally, Mr. Li also pointed out a few points: (1) "Some people say that he (referring to Mr. Lvg Kang) is Mr. Xiao Mao, who opposes the reform of civilization drama. Maybe not. One thing is true: that is, he has not had a deeper relationship with the personnel and theater movement in the isolated island." (2) "The four doors of the isolated island theater community are wide open. Anyone who stands on a line can come in, only Mr. Lvg Kang sees "sectarianism." And uses Mr. Li's own fact of not being "kicked away" as proof." (3) A group of people engaged in theater movement on the isolated island?</p>
<p>Young people are respectable and pitiful. Their perseverance is probably unexpected by Mr. Lvg Kang. Mr. Li has been messing around with these young people for a year and is moved to "now appear to have become one with them." Now that Mr. Lvg Kang's great work has been completed, everyone has read it all. In terms of facts, there are of course more and more corrections that can be added. However, I don't understand why I don't want to write more "defense" and "correction" here. But I can't help but write, because I have many feelings about this article. Then let's write about feelings.</p>
<p>"Lvg Kang," "Zong Yu," and "Xiao Mao"</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao's announcement for this article was "Zong Yu," but it was published as "Lvg Kang," and the legend in Shanghai is "Xiao Mao," who opposes the reform of civilization drama. At the civilization drama reform symposium, Lvg Kang also agreed to the reform (see the symposium record in the Da Wan Pao). I am the least familiar with the personnel in the literary world, so I naturally cannot talk about "hatred." Therefore, I naively thought here: Is "Lvg Kang" "Xiao Mao"? Why does "Lvg Kang's" article end the discussion on the "civilization drama reform movement" by saying: "The end proves the correctness of the theory of "for life" and "the transformation of civilization drama" (Xiao Mao)—original text—which contains constructive struggles."? If these two names are the same person, please forgive me for naively criticizing two words—despicable! "Scholars have no morals," I never believed this. After reading Mr. Lvg Kang's words such as "political morality," I have a sense of "disappointment." But it is a pity that the Shanghai theater movement is unfairly wronged by this.</p>
<p>"Review" of Work Surface and "Review" of Internal Organization</p>
<p>Like Mr. Lvg Kang, who "no one can say that he is in the circle," may be able to make a "review" based on the surface of the work he has seen, which may still make people feel pertinent. In fact, even this point, Mr. Lvg Kang's work still has problems. For example, he said that "The City That Never Sleeps" is an achievement of reforming civilization drama. I don't know that this script was performed six months before the reform of civilization drama. If we want to talk about the "review" of the internal organization, but it is not based on true facts as the starting point, the "theory" obtained is bound to be wrong. It is inevitable. It is not a pity that one's own theory is wrong, but it is a pity that the Shanghai theater movement is badly affected. Disregarding the impact and slandering emotionally, to borrow Mr. Lvg Kang's own words: "Magnifies one's own mistakes and puts oneself in theoretical bankruptcy in front of the audience and readers." I think the result is to expose oneself, which is painful for relatives and pleasing to enemies! (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e120">Impressions of "Wings of the Navy" <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>(Wings of the Navy)</p>
<p>A Warner Bros. production, showing at the Da Guangming Theater</p>
<p>In newspapers, we are accustomed to hearing about the military expansions of various countries; on the silver screen, military-themed films have also become increasingly common lately. We know there must be a reason for this.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we view this film, "Wings of the Navy," with the same understanding, it might help us to better grasp the subject matter.</p>
<p>"Wings of the Navy" is another film depicting aviation, extensively detailing the process of how air force personnel are created, interspersed with themes of fraternal love and personal affections.</p>
<p>Yes, I should clarify that "Wings of the Navy" describes the process of creating an air force person in considerable detail, from the entrance exams to blind flying. The author expresses everything thoroughly. Fearing the audience's courage might falter, the author depicts their setbacks, but ultimately, they overcome the difficulties and become active in the skies. This is true not only of the final climax but also throughout the film, where the author meticulously explains their successes after each failure. We should understand and appreciate this deliberate effort.</p>
<p>The themes of "Wings of the Navy" are demonstration and encouragement. Woven throughout is a love story.</p>
<p>This love story is a love triangle, but the author doesn't focus heavily on it. The related aspects are still tied to their careers.</p>
<p>For example, in addition to introducing the course processes, we can see this in the two scenes of high-altitude testing accidents and successes.</p>
<p>These two scenes are written in contrast. In the first scene, the plane ascends and suddenly plummets, the pilot faints due to air pressure impact and falls straight down. Keith’s anxious and fearful expression, the sound of the plane crashing, many personnel rushing to rescue, Keith’s rigid back view; the second scene is when Keith discovers that his brother is the pilot of the second high-altitude test. He wants to stop him, but is held back by Jerry's companion. Jerry takes off, ascending to high altitude again, and again suddenly descends, again suffering from air pressure impact. Jerry almost faints, the plane plummets and sways. Keith and Irene's anxious and worried expressions, the plane finally overcomes the difficulty and stabilizes. Keith and Irene both breathe a sigh of relief and laugh. These two scenes are almost identical in their structure, especially the shots of the plane plummeting and the pilot about to faint from the air pressure impact. However, we don't feel it is repetitive or lengthy; on the contrary, it elevates our emotions. Such a clear, brisk, and spirited weaving is extremely delightful. George Brent's and Olivia de Havilland's relieved smiles also become the audience's smiles.</p>
<p>Olivia de Havilland doesn't have many scenes. Honestly, she cannot be considered the protagonist in this film. The true protagonists are all kinds of airplanes. The best scene is the one mentioned above. The same goes for George Brent and John Payne.</p>

<p>Chapter 7: Swallows and Orioles, a United Double Jade Bi; Yue Luo and Wu Brocade, Seven-Sectioned Looms</p>
<p>Originally, the children in this Qingying (Infant) Home had fixed times for sleeping, eating, playing, etc. They were all based on science. Everything also depended on the age of the infants. Every nanny had to adhere to the regulations and order of the home. Ms. Kang Faning felt her responsibility was greater, as it concerned the honor of the home. Therefore, while another nanny might care for four or five children, she only cared for these three children, which also showed the importance that the director of the Infant Welfare Association, Dr. Yin, placed on her. Ms. Kang Ning had already been married. She herself had given birth to a girl, who was also in this Infant Home, cared for by another nanny. Now, she single-mindedly devoted herself to caring for these three little darlings. When the two Miss He entered, they saw the room was in the shape of the character "工," with three small beds placed in it, where the three children slept. There was also a large bed, presumably where she slept. Ms. Kang Ning was leaning against her own bed, and the three children were climbing all over her. One was holding her neck, offering their apple-like little face for her to kiss. One was hugging one of her arms, resting their short-haired forehead on her arm. One was lying across her head, reaching their little hand into her chest. Ms. Kang Ning chuckled, and the three children also laughed incessantly. Zhu Airen walked in first and called out, "Ms. Kang, you have guests!" Ms. Kang Ning quickly steadied the three children and looked up. She saw Liao De, the director of the Infant Welfare Association. There were also two others, with similar faces, who were somewhat unfamiliar. Although they were unfamiliar, she knew that Zhu Airen had not come here yesterday afternoon, and it was said that he had gone to the Suzhou train station to pick up two classmates. These were probably those two. At that time, Ms. Kang Ning also introduced these three little friends to them, "Look! Mr. Zhu and Mr. Liao are here. Hurry! Be good! Don't make a fuss! Bow to these gentlemen and shake hands." Sure enough, one of the three children extended a small hand. Zhu Airen quickly took it and praised, "Good boy! Little brother!" The other two also hurriedly extended their hands. The two Miss He each took one, rubbing their snow-white, soft arms against their noses. Zhu Airen then introduced the two Miss He to Ms. Kang Ning. Hai Ying also introduced Ms. Kang Ning to the two Miss He. Ms. Kang Ning then instructed the three little boys to bow to the two Miss He. At this time, the children in this room were not afraid of strangers at all, their eyes as bright as lacquer, looking at everyone. (75)</p>

<p>— Tongye, sent from Chongqing</p>
<p>An Air Force Movie Produced by Central Photography Studio</p>
<p>Consultant: Xie Taojun, Producer: Luo Xueqian</p>
<p>Director: Sun Yu, Cinematographer: Hong Weilie</p>
<p>Cast: Gao Gefei, Bai Yang, Zhao Dan, Gu Er'yi, Shi Chao, etc.</p>
<p>"Air Force movies" have never been made in our country. Now, the Central Photography Studio's new "Miles of Sky" can be said to be an unprecedented great aviation film. Not only is the plot tortuous and mysterious, but the acting is also passionate and intense; watching it will definitely make your blood boil. Unfortunately, we residents of isolated islands can only yearn for it temporarily, and it will not be able to enter our sight until the final victory. I will now introduce the plot to the readers first, which can also give you some spiritual comfort! (Editor)</p>
<p>On September 18th Incident, Japanese bandits seized our four northeastern provinces, and thirty million compatriots were reduced to slaves, and more than five million square miles of land was trampled on by enemy hooves. Vast wealth, huge amounts of ordnance, along with 260 aircraft, all fell into enemy hands; the Northeast Aviation School was also destroyed.</p>
<p>Gao Fei, a mechanic from the Northeast Aviation School, followed the crowd into the interior. During the journey, they were chased and strafed by enemy aircraft, causing many casualties. A girl, Bai Shanfeng, helped her injured father, leaving her younger sister, Xiao Yun, behind. During the dangerous journey, Gao Fei hid and protected Xiao Yun, saving her from death. Gao watched the enemy aircraft with burning anger.</p>
<p>Gao had relatives in Jinan, so he studied at Qilu University and its affiliated high school. In his spare time, he often engaged in physical exercise. One day, in the sports field, he chatted with his classmates Yue Yiqin and Zhao Wanli. Yue was lying on the grass, looking at three or five eagles circling in the sky, as if lost in thought. Gao asked him, and Yue smiled and showed him a newspaper clipping of the Central Aviation School in Jianqiao advertising for flying students. Gao and Zhao also each produced their own clippings of the same advertisement, and the three agreed. They decided to leave Qilu and study aviation instead.</p>
<p>Since the "January 28th" Incident, our country has worked hard to build an air force. Young people from all over the country came after hearing the news. Gao, Yue, and Zhao passed the preliminary and follow-up physical and academic tests and joined the Air Force Enlistment Camp, where they received army training for one year before being promoted to flight students. At the opening ceremony, they respectfully listened to the address, received the Air Force Training Regulations and Air Force Creed, and sang the aviation school's school song, which was magnificent and soaring.</p>
<p>Gao, Yue, Zhao, and other flight students such as Gu Changkong, were trained by Captain Gao Zhihang. They were divided into groups to learn basic flying. The first time they flew into the clouds, it was like ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>Mechanic Shi Qi was loyal to his service. He once jokingly told Gao and Zhao that mechanics are bird watchers; washing them, brushing them, healing them, feeding them, so that they can fly, sing, and fight, but these are iron birds. Thousands of hot-blooded youths were nurtured and trained for the country, just like thousands of iron blocks, forged into steel in a furnace. Gao, Yue, Zhao, and other flight students decided to take on the future heavy responsibility of the country, and under the iron training discipline, they got up early, assembled, practiced flying, exercised, and rested, bravely moving forward day by day, year by year, and year by year. Zhao, Yue, and others all graduated and became team members, or served as instructors to train flight students who came later.</p>
<p>In the midst of arduous and intense training, there should also be adequate rest. One Sunday, four trucks drove out of the aviation school gate to the fruit shop outside the school where they were friendly with the girl Qing'er. As usual, aviation school students would buy a large amount of fruit from Qing'er. On that day, Gao Fei, Zhao Wanli, Shi Qi, and Gu Changkong, four close friends, were on the same car. Shi, Zhao, and Yue deliberately made things difficult for Gao and Gu, buying all the fruit in Qing'er's basket and throwing it to their comrades in the car to eat, singing and laughing. They soon arrived in Hangzhou. The air force athletes dispersed or went together to visit friends, climb mountains, ride horses, or race boats. The Six Bridges and Three Tianzhu were decorated by the air force athletes, adding a lot of color.</p>
<p>Gao, Zhao, Gu, and Shi toured Sudi together and met a girl, Bai Shanfeng, whom they were amazed as a celestial being. They attempted to get to know her, as the four were not yet married. Unfortunately, there was no way to know who she was. Later, they entered the newly opened Fengyun Cafe and learned that the girl was the daughter of the owner, Bai Shanfeng.</p>
<p>Before long, a team of elementary school students, male and female, entered the cafe to raise money for airplane donations. First, they sang a patriotic song, "Tomorrow's Victory," saying that those who have strength should contribute strength, and those who have money should contribute money. The leader of the singing was Bai Shanfeng's younger sister, Bai Xiaoyun. After singing, they split up to solicit donations from each table. The air force athletes scrambled to donate generously. Other customers also readily gave money. However, one customer, wanting to fawn over his girlfriend, hated that the children's singing interrupted his flattery. He refused to donate a single coin, and ridiculed the absurdity of raising money for airplanes, also involving air force issues. Xiaoyun was humiliated and cried. Gao, Zhao, and other drinkers were greatly indignant and severely punished him. After scolding him, they asked him to try the taste of an airplane bombing, and the group threw eggs at him, drenching him thoroughly. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Thirteenth Sister Filial to Her Mother and Righteousness Respecting Her Teacher</p>
<p>As for He Yufeng, she was the beloved daughter of a martial general. Although she had learned some martial arts from her father since childhood, she was not as timid as Young Master An. However, because she constantly remembered the deep hatred of killing her father, she inquired about the news of her enemies everywhere. Not only did she live incognito in no fixed place, fearing the secret schemes of the Ji bandits, but she also had to serve her elderly and sick mother, escaping east and west, living a life of exile. The sadness in her heart was naturally ten times greater than that of Young Master An. However, she also held the same concept of "filial piety," so she threw all kinds of pain into the land of nothingness. The two protagonists in the book both did not forget the foundation of being human, to be filial sons and daughters, therefore, after they met each other, they achieved a happy marriage. Although there were many twists and turns in the middle, and Mr. An (Young Master An's father, named Xuehai.) put in a lot of effort to achieve this, the result was that he managed to marry this chivalrous and filial woman who was beautiful and talented, letting his son enjoy this good fortune. If you want to talk about it in terms of superstition, it was all due to the couple's filial piety, which allowed them to be matched.</p>
<p>Ji Gantang in "A Tale of Heroic Sons and Daughters" is known to everyone to be an allusion to Nian Gengyao, because the six characters Nian, Geng, Xian, Tang, Yao, are all words used in Qing Dynasty for comparison. In the early Qing Dynasty, Nian Gengyao successively held the official positions of Governor of Sichuan and Shaanxi and General Fuyuan, suppressing the border in Sichuan, conquering Tibet, and pacifying Qinghai, making many meritorious contributions and being granted the title of first-class duke. His power at that time was truly enormous and amazing, and his personality was cruel and bloodthirsty, and his military orders were strict, making him one of the top figures since the Qing Dynasty.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Random Notes from the Metropolis <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The dance manuscript has reached its sixteenth installment. There have been few realistic records in between. The Metropolis is a place where my footprints are more frequent, so the impression is also more profound. It may be written based on facts (sixteen) and asking for advice from fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Ballroom</p>
<p>The Metropolis, based on its moderate location, has a vast garden and lush trees. Although the architecture is not as elaborate as the Xianle and Baili Men, it makes up for its shortcomings and can be called no less than them. The door faces Gordon Road, next to Dahua Road, making parking extremely convenient. Inside the first door, there is a counter for hiring silver cars. Inside the second door is a reception room, with cloakrooms, public telephone rooms, and men's restrooms on both sides. Inside the third door is a corridor, with snack and toy stalls on both sides. There, you can often see two friends in neat suits serving as greeters. On their chubby faces, there is always a smile and a friendly expression. Their attitude towards guests, regardless of gender, age, or seniority, has never changed. It is true that harmony brings wealth, and it cannot be said that these two have not made a part of the contribution to the prosperity of the Metropolis. I am a forgetful person, I only remember that the younger one is called Afeng, and I heard that he is the deputy manager inside.</p>
<p>Passing through the corridor is the dance floor, divided into three levels. The highest level is along the edge, with long sofas, which is very convenient for couples to accompany. A circle of single-person walking paths is left in front of the sofa. The second level is set up with many round tables and seats that can accommodate two to three hundred people. The last level is the dance floor. The pool is circular, extremely large, and the floor is extremely smooth. There are twenty-eight round tables by the pool, each with four seats. This is the throne of the dancers. If all the seats are full, there will be as many as one hundred and twelve people. However, the four tables at the head and tail are probably always absent. Looking around, the number is generally around one hundred.</p>
<p>Brilliant Red Stars Now it is time to write about all the brilliant red stars. Before writing, I must apologize, because to write about all one hundred people, not only is the length of the article not allowed, but I also do not have such a good memory. If I choose to write, the so-called "allowable person, in the end, should the subjective standard be used, or the objective standard be used?" Fortunately, the name of the article I write is called Xie Ying (Writing Shadows), so I might as well write some unclear comments based on some muddled impressions. As for whether the records are correct and the comments are fair, it can be said that I myself am at a loss.</p>
<p>Starting from the music stage at the entrance, Min Huang sits at the sixth table. Although she is young, she is quite quiet and lovely, and she is also quite understanding of people. She always responds with a smile, and her dancing skills are not weak. The seventh table is Ma Yuanyuan, whose original surname is Zheng. Zheng is Huang’s nephew and uncle, slim and exquisite, fair and delicate. She is older than Huang, but her childishness surpasses him. Some say she is innocent, others dislike her willfulness. She can sing one or two Beijing opera songs, and her Shanghai opera and Yue opera imitations are very good. Shen Weiying at the ninth table is very beautiful from a distance, but seems to be slightly inferior up close. Ye Peishan at the eleventh table is a big child. If you don’t ask her age, you can’t guess that she is only twenty-eight years old. She has a round face and bright eyes, with a unique style. Li Mingzhu is a beautiful woman approaching her prime. She can communicate with her eyes, and her conversation is naturally even more skillful. Ru Aina has a beautiful appearance, and Sister Hu is good at flattery, both are good. Yu Manli at the twelfth table, whose real name is Zuo Zhongyu, can be considered a beauty in the making, but unfortunately, she is often sick, and even in normal times, she cannot avoid having some morbidity. She used to not be able to talk much, but now she has improved a lot. Huang Meiqin was only discovered yesterday, and her dancing skills are very good. Jin Lili at the thirteenth table, her dancing skills truly deserve the praise of being light as a swallow. Her temperament and attitude can also be described as gentle and generous. She sings Qingyi with good rhythm and tone. It is said that her brother once learned the erhu at my house, and she also wanted to ask me to learn some singing and acting, but unfortunately, I have been called her master for several months, and I have not learned half an act. It is really that we do not have time and there is no way. Her younger sister, Jin Didi, is a very young child, and her appearance is very much like a beauty in the making. At the same table is also Gu Yumei, who is tall and graceful, and has a beautiful appearance. Because the newspaper published a case involving her and Lei Xiaokai, her business has decreased a lot. It is said that she will be leaving the pier soon. There is also Li Ying, who is twenty years old. The upper half of her face is very much like Mei Lanfang, and her temper is very gentle. Recently, she also wanted to learn opera, and it is said that her voice is good, but unfortunately, I have never heard her. At the fourteenth table is Xu Cuiying, who can be called a social expert. The Cao Suqin sisters at the twentieth table, one is charming, and the other is lively and lovely. They are both very tall and are very suitable for dancing with tall guests. There are also Zheng Mingming, Lin Beibei, and Yang Wenying, who, like Jin Lili, belong to the top ten dancers who were selected. The ceremony was held at the Baili Men on the Yellow Flower Mound Memorial Day, and it was very lively. The length of the article is already long, so I will not list more. In short, the Metropolis has a complete and rich pool of talent.</p>
<p>Due to advertising congestion today, the length of the article has been shortened, and the chess garden will be suspended once. It will be published tomorrow as usual. This is an announcement.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Finance  International Aid Obtained, Gold Prices Plunge <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot gold's gray market continued its decline. It's understood that this was due to news reports that a US$15 million loan from the US had been secured. Although it was specified that these funds were allocated for the purchase of aircraft engines, it further brightened prospects for the war effort. Also, French Premier Daladier's tough stance ensured no change in Franco-Italian relations. The British monarch has approved a loan of £5 million to China to replenish the legal tender (fapi) fund. With increasingly stable and profitable legal tender, naturally fewer people were interested in stagnant gold. Wealthy collectors generally thought about taking action. Therefore, although a certain bank (acting on behalf of a foreign bank) actively bought 150 taels, and some money changers also made small purchases, everyone was unanimously bearish. Furthermore, gold shops and pawnshops, along with two other money changers, began selling off their holdings en masse, causing prices to plunge sharply, ultimately falling by twelve yuan. Although foreign banks secretly absorbed some gold during the middle of the day, it had no significant impact. Trading was slightly more active than the previous two days, with 550 taels changing hands. Gold jewelry prices remained steady. Customs gold remained level. China-British pure gold continued to rise slightly.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Plunges Twelve Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each tael (ten liang) initially opened weaker, because of the news that day of the successful Sino-American loan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to trend looser and stronger due to the impact of devaluation, causing sentiment to weaken again. Gold shops took the lead and quoted 2,080 yuan for sale, but at that time, buyers were holding back and watching. At 9:45 AM, a certain bank suddenly started buying on behalf of foreign banks, and transactions began. Gold shops and spot gold shops successively sold a total of 150 taels to a certain bank at 2,077 yuan, which was the opening price, five yuan lower than the previous closing price. After the opening, jewelry stores also came to sell off their holdings, selling 50 taels at the same price to fellow businesses, money changers, and securities firms. Afterwards, a certain money changer absorbed 50 taels from fellow businesses and gold shops, priced at 76 yuan. After this, sellers still wanted to dump their holdings, but because buyers were holding back and observing, no transactions occurred until noon, so the closing price remained at 76 yuan. In the afternoon, because sellers were even more cautious and watchful, the market became increasingly weak. The initial transaction was four yuan lower, with money changers trading five taels among themselves at 72 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a money changer at 71 yuan. Later, the money changer sold 50 taels to a gold shop at 70 yuan. After this, the market became quiet. Until after 4:00 PM, a certain jewelry store suddenly expressed interest in buying, but sellers had no inventory to supply, making transactions difficult. Therefore, the closing price in the evening remained at 2,070 yuan, resulting in a net drop of twelve yuan compared to the previous day, a full seven yuan difference. The selling price of spot gold from spot gold shops was 2,080 yuan, and the buying price was 2,065 yuan. The current asking price for gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, but no transactions took place.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Remain at Original Levels. Although spot gold prices trended lower, the listed prices for gold jewelry in jewelry stores remained at their original levels. Dahang's price was 211 yuan per tael, Xinhang's price was 209 yuan, and the buying price was 203 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Continues to Rise Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 30th. According to a telegram, British pure gold continued to rise by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, 6 and a half pennies. As a result, the central bank's buying price for Chinese spot gold also rose to 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed price for customs gold remained level at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also continued to rise by 3 jiao, reaching 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Money Changers Also Selling Hong Kong Notes <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold continued to rise by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate remained unchanged. The local foreign exchange market was experiencing a peak in settlement by various companies and foreign firms at the end of the month. Fortunately, the supply of Hong Kong telegraphs and foreign banks was smooth, and the market price remained stable, with neither gains nor losses. Spot gold opened weakly, and there was a lot of selling pressure. Jewelry stores and money changers were unable to absorb the selling pressure effectively. Subsequently, the Hong Kong exchange rate was reported to be loose, and the Hong Kong gold price fell. Gold shops and money changers sold their holdings in a rush, further weakening the market price. Trading was sluggish. Foreign currency, British gold pounds, continued to flow out of wealthy hands. The market price weakened and declined accordingly. There was strong demand for British and American gold notes from foreign banks. There were rumors of Hong Kong currency devaluation, and money changers rushed to sell their holdings, creating a very weak market. Fortunately, foreign banks absorbed the selling pressure smoothly, gradually halting the downward trend. The exchange market association had very active trading. Changtai sold 200 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Yongtai. Hengmao sold 1,000 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Hongchang. Qintai sold 500 yuan of US dollar notes to Tongfeng. Xianglian sold 500 yuan of US dollar notes to Yongtai. Tongfeng sold 2,000 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Hongchang. Xiangkang sold 300 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Hongchang. Changtai sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Tongfeng. Chengtai sold 40 pounds of British gold notes to Tongfeng. Qintai sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Tongfeng. Hongchang sold 200 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Changtai. Huitong sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Changtai. Yesterday's market prices saw the British gold pound drop by 1 jiao, the US dollar note rise by 4 li, the Hong Kong note drop by 2 fen, 4 qu, and the French franc note rise by 5 hao. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Hong Kong Exchange Rate Marked by Selling; Finally Loosening to Fifty-Six Yuan; British-American Exchange Rate Remains Stable <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Although large foreign firms and foreign merchants colluded in the foreign exchange market yesterday, foreign banks such as HSBC were willing to supply, and there were also some sales coming from Hong Kong via foreign telegrams. Consequently, there were no fluctuations in the middle of the day, and the overall result was neither gains nor losses. Trading was average throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, due to the previous day's weakness and the growing rumors of Hong Kong currency devaluation, Chinese and foreign banks rushed to sell, almost creating a wave of selling. In addition, the settlement of accounts by foreign firms decreased, so the loosening trend was quite sharp, eventually reaching 56 yuan. Trading was also very active.</p>
<p>In the early morning, large London drafts for near and distant dates were level, and New York silver prices remained stable. London raw gold rose by half a penny, the exchange rate of British pound against US dollar rose by 7 hao, and there were no changes against French franc or Shanghai. The US dollar against British pound and French franc also remained unchanged, but fell by 6 fen against Shanghai. The Shanghai Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening selling prices in the morning were 8 pence 25 for British pound and 16 yuan 0625 for US dollar, both level compared to the previous close. After the opening, foreign firms and foreign merchants successively concluded transactions, but foreign firms such as HSBC were willing to supply, so the situation remained quite stable. Foreign firms advantageously settled British pound at 8 pence 25 with HSBC, and HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The unveiling of the silver equalization tax was also level, still levied at 4.00 percent. Subsequently, foreign firms again bought US dollar at 16 yuan 0625 from a certain bank, and the situation remained largely unchanged. Later, transactions gradually calmed down, while buying and selling of Hong Kong exchange rate was quite lively. Foreign banks Hua Yi, Dutch bank, and Chinese bank Guangdong, all started selling Hong Kong exchange rate to foreign firms, from 55 yuan 625 loosening to 56 yuan. Later, it rebounded to 55 yuan 875. By the time the bank's selling price closed at noon, the British and American exchange rates were the same as the opening prices in the morning.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, foreign firms initially settled British pound at 8 pence 25 with Hong Kong Electric HSBC, and the situation remained quite stable. The US dollar situation was also level, but no transactions were seen. After entering the afternoon, Hong Kong exchange rate was very active in buying and selling. Chinese banks again sold Hong Kong exchange rate to foreign firms at 56 yuan. By the time the bank's selling prices closed in the evening, the British pound was at 8 pence 25, and the US dollar was at 16 yuan 0625. As a result, compared to the previous day, neither the British nor American exchange rates saw any gains or losses, while the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to loosen by half a yuan.</p>

<p>The gray market for securities yesterday continued to be quiet and stagnant. Individual retail investors were weak in sentiment. Large institutional investors were watching each other. Although there was the establishment of the US loan and the long-term public price of finance to pay principal and interest, the appetite of the "eating households" remained sluggish. The market situation was uncertain, but because there were only a few sellers, the surface still felt firm. The future may still have a period of sideways movement. Yesterday's progress: The market initially trended upward in the morning due to purchases by Tianxing Lemao, but then turned weak due to sales by Tongkang Xieda. Although Lianhehao had replenishment purchases, retail investors still had disposals, and it still felt unable to rally. In the afternoon, Tongkang continued to have sales, and Yongkang sold Class B. Although the 20th and 40th slightly collected, the market price was just stagnant. As a result, E, D, and C all had no ups and downs, Class A was down slightly 2 jiao, and Class E was down slightly 5 fen. The number of transactions was generally no more than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock market conditions: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company stock were traded at a price of 6 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>London China bonds, the listed market price on the 30th of last month (Thursday), the market disk was stagnant, and basically had to wait until the Chinese government and the creditors' representatives had agreed on concrete measures before it could be restarted. Yesterday's market conditions: A small number of bonds had already fallen, including the Crisp Loan and the Canton-Kowloon Railway Loan, each falling by £1.5. The former was priced at £38, and the latter was priced at £19.5. (According to the Crisp Loan, yesterday was the interest payment period, and the new price should be calculated excluding interest. If calculated excluding interest of £2.5, the market price actually rose by £1.) Also, the British-issued bonds of the Reorganization Loan also rose by half a pound, priced at £51.5, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>London British Far East company stocks, the listed market price on the 30th of last month (Thursday), the trend turned stable. Only Jardine Matheson Bank shares continued to fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £8, 7 shillings and 6 pence, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stock market is currently in a state of confusion and slight weakness. Although the selling wind is not strong, the prices of most stocks have slightly fallen. Jardine Matheson shares' buying price has fallen to 19 yuan and 5 jiao. The price of Wheelock shares once fell to 34 yuan, 2 jiao, 5 fen, and the price of Consolidated Rubber Plantation fell to 8 yuan. These prices saw a small number of buyers. Yup Kwong shares were traded at 8 yuan, 8 jiao. Tramway shares and Kung Wo Cheung shares' potential remains strong. There is still good demand for the debentures of various companies. Rubber shares' trading is stagnant, and the difference between the buying and selling prices is very large.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Yarn and Cotton, Coarse Yarn Tianjin Merchants Continue Healthy Purchasing, 20-Count Yarn Able to Maintain, Japanese Yarn Mills Offer 2,000-3,000 Bales <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market still shows signs of fluctuating, but the actual demand is still not strong, and people's hearts are more peaceful. In addition, the situation of 10-count coarse yarn is tight, and Tianjin merchants' digestion continues unabated. The market price of 32-count single yarn is also safe, so although the chips in the market for 20-count yarn have increased, some are paying attention to the above situation, and the attitude is mostly tranquil, without panic. As for the transportation along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi route being affected by the military and temporarily suspended, fortunately, there is still demand in South China, Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, etc., and the market price is maintained by it. Generally speaking, it is currently in a fluctuating state. If it remains stagnant for a long time and the merchant sales do not come, there may be changes again.</p>
<p>Current Yarn Situation: The market opened weakly again in the morning. After waiting for a long time, merchants did not come to purchase. The current yarn dispatched by general current yarn merchants was in a hurry to sell off, and the opening price fell by another 1.5 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 370 yuan and 5 jiao. Guangdong merchants Wanxing bought 200 bales, leading to support of the virtual qi. Subsequently, the market gradually rebounded as the situation stabilized. By the closing, the current price returned to 372 yuan. The warehouse receipt price initially fell to 369 yuan and 5 jiao, and also returned to 71 yuan at the closing. The market was still sluggish and weak in the afternoon. Only 10-count coarse yarn was more solid due to the constant search by Tianjin merchants. As a result, various merchants bought a total of 1,360 bales. The market conditions for 20-count Tiannv and Shuangma were not much different from the market price of the previous day. Only the prices of 16-count and 10-count yarn were stable as usual. Xinyu Factory offered 200 bales of 10-count Shuang Diqiu, priced from 291 yuan and 5 jiao to 1 yuan and 7 jiao. Shenxin Factory offered 120 bales of 10-count Tongzijun, priced at 290 yuan and 5 jiao, all bought by Tianjin merchants. Today, 1,700 pieces of yarn were transported to Tianjin, 1,000 pieces to Shantou, 140 pieces to Hong Kong, 120 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 797 pieces to Haiphong. The amount bought by each merchant is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Market: The trend turned downward, because the high prices in recent days have caused the factory to offer 20-count Shuiyue and Lanfeng yarn in April and May, as many as 2,000 to 3,000 bales. As a result, the people's hearts loosened a step. The spot goods were affected by it and fell by 1-2 yuan. It is said that the opening price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 322 yuan, plus the consolidated tax. Yesterday, the price of 20-count Shuiyue current yarn was 342 yuan and 5 jiao, and the price of 20-count Lanfeng current yarn was 322 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market: The New York cotton market, due to the fall in security prices and the public settlement of 6-7 pounds of sound, Washington is considering using subsidies to export American cotton because of the overproduction of American cotton, in order to remedy this. However, the opposition from Southern congressmen is quite fierce. A meeting was held yesterday, and a new proposal has emerged from Smith's proposal. The meeting has already passed it. The content includes recovering 3 million bales of cotton from government loans. According to the members of the committee, Roosevelt's export subsidy bill will not be passed when it comes to the committee in the future. The overproduction of American cotton, this problem is very serious, and there will be many branches in the future. Yesterday, Indian predicted to fall by 2 rupees, and Egyptian was level. Yesterday, the exchange rate was not very different. Converted to legal tender, American and Brazilian cotton fell by 3 jiao per picul, Indian cotton fell by 6 jiao, and Egyptian cotton remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Because Japanese factories will lose Chinese cotton, and the release period of American cotton has not yet been determined, the Japanese have been purchasing Brazilian cotton in large quantities recently as a precaution.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Factory Processing Activated, Local Cotton Transactions Improve <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The local cotton business, which had been slow for two days, was suddenly active yesterday, but prices fell. The factory processing has been activated. Although fine yarn transactions have been slow in Chinese factories recently, the sales of 10-count coarse yarn have been wide, so the demand for Yao clothing is very healthy. As for Japanese factories opening a large number of cotton yarn and cotton cloth pieces, it is rumored that raw materials are also being replenished, but foreign cotton is the main product, and local white bag cotton is also purchased. It is mixed with it to regulate the spinning. On the one hand, the work efficiency is improved, and on the other hand, the products are bright and clean. As a result, the local cotton trade has improved, and except for Tong cotton, which is slightly soft, other selling prices are not much different from the previous day's prices. 818 bales of Subei to Tongzhou fine lint cotton arrived. 6,280 pieces of cotton arrived from Ningbo yesterday, and 750 pieces of cotton machine flowers also arrived. There are still 30 pieces to be transported to Shantou today. The amount of current cotton transactions and market disk are listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Grain, Current Foreign Flour Depreciates Another Jiao <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Factory Flour: The current flour market situation has been in a slump for the past few days. Since the third batch of special-priced sales by the Beiyang merchants opened the night before last, Bingchuan Brand No. 2 flour was priced at 4 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, and Pao Che Brand was only 4 yuan and 3 jiao. The number of transactions in recent days has also been less than 100,000 bags. It is said that in recent days, there has been a lack of Beiyang ship spaces, and the completed goods cannot be shipped as much as possible, resulting in a reduction in the appetite of merchant customers. Yesterday, the Japanese Street also requested a reduction in price by analogy, because the customer base was small. As a result, the wholesale price on this street fell from 4 yuan and 4 jiao and a half yesterday to 4 jiao, 5 fen lower than before. The new transactions then increased to nearly 10,000 bags. However, the Nanyang Merchants' transactions have not yet started. Although the merchant customers of the Fu Shan Merchants have been widely requested, the factory still needs to have a slight distinction between retail and bulk orders, and the brands such as Pao Che and Tianzhu Yuweng are also different. However, the North China market is now able to be served by Japanese and foreign flour. On the surface, there may still be a struggle on the surface.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: The source of foreign flour is constantly coming in. In addition to the new arrival of more than 40,000 bags from Kung Lee, it is said that there will be another ship coming early next week. The inventory of foreign flour in the market is increasing day by day, and the market price of factory flour has been reduced again and again due to the dumping. Therefore, it is not easy for foreign flour to depreciate and sell well. According to customer discussions, there are currently frequent procedures for foreign flour to pay taxes. If there is no ship space for shipping, it must also compensate for fees such as warehouse rent. Therefore, the customer appetite has gradually become lax in the past few days, only relying on sporadic spot transactions on this street. A total of more than 10,000 bags of Hongri Dangtian and Bat brand flour were opened, priced at 4 yuan and 3 jiao of exchange division, and 4 yuan and 1 jiao of current yarn, which is another jiao smaller than before, and it is driving side by side with factory flour.</p>
<p>Exports: 17,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin today, and 5,000 bags were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Du Mi Guest Xian: Merchants and Hoarders Are All Watching <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>A total of fourteen or fifteen numbers of Du rice have arrived from He Xia. The bags delivered by car have only reached 1,500 to 1,600 bags of Su Tongkun Gang. The seller's thoughts are still firm, but the sales ground is stagnant. The street and hoarders are all watching. Each goods is difficult to make an opening, the market barely shows a stalemate. However, such as the thin japonica medium goods, the price is repaired a few points. Du Yangjian, Bu Jian, and the supply and demand of the variable Yin Yuan are similar, and there are no gains or losses.</p>
<p>Customer rice has only a slight response from the local street stores and retail customers. Customer merchants have not had a taste for it for a long time. The trade has also stopped and waited to see. Moreover, there are floating hoards seeking to sell. Therefore, the number of transactions is only 2,200 to 2,300 bags. The market price has rebounded slightly by 4-5 points to nearly Jiao, not uniform. High-quality Jingwu rice has not been traded, and the Wu rice sold in the market is of large market quality, priced at 12 yuan 6 jiao and a half to 12 yuan 7 jiao and a half.</p>

<p>Regarding the soybean oil market yesterday, the people were weak at the beginning of the morning due to the decline of the Lian Dian. After entering, the Lian city fell sharply by more than a yuan. It was heard that Dalian also had unified export of oil beans, and the people in the market suddenly became restless. The spot market suddenly jumped by five or six jiao, and the futures were also two or three jiao (the order stated, "Irresistible by manpower, can be cancelled"). The system is something that is expected, but it will definitely not be implemented in a short time, or it may be a smokescreen for manipulation, so the trading of futures oil has shown no signs of disappearing, but the transactions in the market have decreased. It is estimated that the transaction of Suifeng factory's canned oil was 500 dan at a price of 32 yuan 5 jiao, Yanqi oil was 30 pieces at 24 yuan, Lianqi was 50 pieces at 31 yuan, and Da Lou Road cargo was 300 pieces, from the old price of 10 yuan 6 jiao, and it soared to 31 yuan 5 jiao. The oil of Fengnian was 50 barrels at 33 yuan 4 jiao. Dalian No. 100 barrels, the price was from 33 yuan 4 jiao to 33 yuan 8 jiao, and the price of 50 barrels in seven days was 33 yuan 3 jiao, and the price of 400 barrels in April was 33 yuan 2 jiao and a half and 6 jiao, and the price of 300 barrels in May was 33 yuan 2 jiao and a half, and 4 jiao.</p>
<p>Today, 500 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The wholesale of national cloth in the street has been very busy in the past few days. Clothing companies have a large number of transactions in spring and summer goods, bleached City Mansion silk standard cloth, bleached fine twill, and Buqi cloth. Lun Chang Factory's non-fading ramie is also selling 40 to 50 boxes a day, and the demand from Sichuan and Yunnan merchants is also strong. However, subject to the restrictions on flight hangar capacity, the goods to be loaded are still heavily stocked. Guangdong merchants have newly purchased more than 100 boxes of bleached cloth, City Mansion silk colored cloth and colored twill. Although the taste of Wen and Yong Gang is stagnant, 30 to 40 pieces of white goods and coarse cloth have been added. The Shanghai Exchange rate in Yongdi has also fallen, which cancels each other out. The market price of white goods and fine cloth is falling due to the sluggish sales in Zhejiang and Jiangxi. Yong'an Factory's Dapeng brand has dropped from the highest price of 13 yuan 3 jiao and 5 fen this month to the current market price of 13 yuan 1 jiao. Shenxin Factory's Fugui brand has dropped from 12 yuan 9 jiao and a half to 12 yuan 8 jiao in the current market, and there are still very few people asking. Coarse cloth and fine twill are still actively selling, and the decline is also more moderate. 14-pound goods of coarse cloth are continuously traded in bulk. The market atmosphere is the strongest. The market trend of the remaining stalls yesterday was divergent, with a tendency to fall by 2.5 to 5 fen. Fine twill dyeing factories are looking for low-cost manual goods and purchasing nearly 200 bales. The factory price is 1 or 2 jiao higher per bolt than the market price, so the market price is still stable. The price of bleached, dyed, and printed cloth is also difficult to loosen because most of the grey cloth is firm.</p>
<p>The Dongbu market is stable, but fine twill has fallen by about 5 fen per bolt due to the slight decline in dyeing and sales in this street. However, Qingdao Gang in the north still has an appetite and is purchasing 400 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Foreign firm white goods have not been opened, only Abe Shixing sold 50 boxes of Sijunzi Serge, priced at 3 jiao 8 fen 875 per yard, cash, and the current market price must be 3 jiao 9 fen or more. The wholesale in the Hang-Jia-Hu guerrilla area is the most prosperous.</p>
<p>Silky Feather Yarn: The silky feather yarn woven by small Shanghai machine households is used for spring suits. The wholesale price of No. 1 goods is 9 jiao and a half per yard, No. 2 goods is 8 jiao and a half, No. 3 goods is 7 jiao and a half, No. 4 goods is 6 jiao and 7 fen and a half, and No. 5 goods is 5 jiao 8 and 9 fen. The brands of No. 3 and 4 are the most popular. The brands of Daohua and Datong factories are more famous. The width is still 28 inches, and each bolt is 40 to 50 yards long.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>510 pieces of cloth were shipped to Tianjin, 270 pieces to Yantai, 580 pieces to Shantou, 55 pieces to Hong Kong, 280 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 430 pieces to Haiphong. All were exported today.</p>

<p>Foreign silk prices are mixed. There are ups and downs in New York. The exchange opening price is a small 1 or 2 points. The Yokohama opening market is a small 10 yuan or more. The silk price in Lyon is also rising and falling. The Shanghai silk market is still quiet. A white factory's 20.22 striped poplar returned. The foreign bank's eating price is only 1,600 yuan, so the transaction has stopped again. Only the double palace warp continues to reach new high prices. The 40.60 striped pattern opened at 1,060 yuan. It is estimated that the American bank sold 10 dan. Domestic sales are still weak. The lower body of the serge has a slight zero presentation move. The opening price is 850 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 269 pieces of Husi and 174 pieces of silk ends were shipped to Mochi. As for tea exports, 434 boxes were shipped to Europe yesterday, and another 10 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The guild set the price for No. 24 Dutch refined white for re-export to rise five cents, with over 400 bags changing hands at $16.70. Spot goods at the local exchange were at $24.85. There were no changes in Dutch red sugar. Taikoo granulated white sugar showed a slight tightening in supply, with Western Exchange goods quoted at $24.80 and Eastern Exchange goods at $24.60. Zhen Ji No. 1 ice sugar was at $31.30. Chaozhou sugar dealers offered over 200 bags of Shantou refined white, with the best quality at $23.50, the next grade at $23.25 to $23.10. Huanggang green sugar was quoted at $14.50, but no transactions took place. Due to dealers' reluctance to increase imports of Diaoqing (a type of green sugar), bids were unrealistic. However, the dealers also felt that lowering prices further would be futile, so they are all taking a wait-and-see approach. It is unlikely that any transactions will occur soon. On the 30th, 279 bags of sugar arrived from Shantou.</p>

<p>Hongji white coal continues to show a fluctuating situation. The demand in this area has not increased, but the supply keeps coming in. Normally, there would be no shortage, but because there is more dust than lumps, it feels scarce and therefore more valuable. Recently, one firm had over 5,000 tons arrive, but lump coal only accounted for 30% of that, resulting in insufficient supply on the market for distribution. Backdoor prices have been steadily rising, but the quoted price for Hongji standard coal remains at $45 per ton, and screened lumps at $47. Delivery requires an additional cartage fee, but the gray market price is up by two or three dollars.</p>

<h3 id="e142">The Yunnan-Burma Road: A Mission of the Times – A General Overview <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Cheng</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, twenty months have swiftly passed. Coastal provinces have, one after another, fallen into enemy hands, causing most of China's normal international transportation to be blocked. However, the entire nation, united in purpose, has been diligently working hard, on the one hand, engaging in various war-supporting activities in the rear, dedicating all efforts to inland construction; on the other hand, devoting all strength to international transportation to seek closer ties with foreign countries. To say nothing of other things, even in terms of transportation construction over the past twenty months, both highways and railways have been progressing rapidly, advancing at an astonishing pace. The entire transportation network in the southwest and northwest has been completed in the shortest possible time, which is exciting news. Among these, the most important in terms of international transportation, and which has attracted the attention of the world, is the recently completed Yunnan-Burma Road.</p>
<p>The provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi are surrounded by high mountains and deep valleys, making transportation routes extremely difficult. In the past, travelers regarded these routes as perilous. However, since the war of resistance began, after more than a year of construction, all inland transportation has become smooth and unhindered, making travel convenient. However, so-called international transportation has always been concentrated in the coastal provinces. Now, apart from the line via Kunming, following the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Haiphong in French Indochina, and the Northwest Highway, which can directly reach Russian Central Asia, there is a feeling that external transportation cannot be developed to its fullest extent. Now, with the completion of the Yunnan-Burma transportation route through collective effort, communication between China and Britain has been realized, which is worthy of national pride, and worthy of attention by both China and foreign countries.</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Burma Road starts from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, runs through western Yunnan, crosses the Hengduan Mountains, and reaches Bhamo in British Burma, with a total length of over 1,140 kilometers. After more than a year of construction through the cooperation of the military and civilians, it has now been completed and has achieved the goal of being open to traffic. The route travels west from Kunming, passing through Anning, Luquan, Chuxiong, Zhennan, Xiangyun, Fengyi, and reaching Xiaguan in Dali; then turning southwest, crossing the Lancang River, passing through Baoshan and crossing the Nujiang River, then following Longling and Mangshi to reach Wanting on the border between Yunnan and Burma. Starting from Wanting, it enters Burmese territory, covering 170 kilometers to reach Bhamo, the terminal station of the Northern Burmese Railway, and from there, it can connect to Rangoon, the capital of Burma.</p>
<p>The road has now been taken over by the Yunnan-Burma Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, and preparations for passenger and freight transport are actively underway. The bus journey will take six days. The first day starts from Kunming to Chuxiong. The second day from Chuxiong to Xiaguan. The third day from Xiaguan to Yongping. The fourth day from Yongping to Baoshan. The fifth day from Baoshan to Longling. The sixth day starts from Longling and reaches Wanting. Wanting is located at the border of Yunnan and Burma, and currently has no accommodations. From there entering Burmese territory, it reaches Bhamo of North Burma Railway. All along the food and lodging stations, the Administration has entrusted to China Travel Service to undertake, and it is heard that the company has been actively working on the project, and has assigned a large number of capable young people to go to the Yunnan border, to be pioneers for the passengers of the road.</p>
<h3 id="e143">How to Go to Hunan and Guangxi <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Xun</p>
<p>Those who want to go to Hunan and Guangxi generally believe that taking the route through the ports of eastern Zhejiang, such as Wenzhou or Ningbo, then taking the highway to Jinhua, and then taking the joint transportation service of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Yuehan, and Xiang-Gui railways to Hunan and Guangxi is the most stable, fastest, and most economical route. Therefore, the route has become increasingly crowded. Since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway stopped operating a few days ago, taking this route is virtually impossible. Now, I will describe another route to Hunan and Guangxi in detail below:</p>
<p>Shanghai to Haiphong: Ships directly sailing there are from Taikoo or Jardine Matheson, with sailings every Monday and Tuesday, passing through Swatow, Hong Kong, Kwangchowan, etc., taking about 10 days. Fares are divided into first-class cabins at 221 or 231 yuan (National currency), second-class first-class cabins at 196 yuan, official cabins at 94 yuan, room cabins at 68 yuan, and steerage at 37 yuan (including landing tax in Haiphong). You can also take a mail ship from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and then transfer to French small Guangdong or Ross vessels and Taikoo or Jardine Matheson ships from Hong Kong to Haiphong, but the fare is more expensive than direct ships.</p>
<p>Haiphong to Hanoi: There are five express trains and five slow trains daily, taking more than two hours by train, with only second and third classes. Second class is 2.10 Vietnamese dollars, and third class is 1.25 Vietnamese dollars. (One Vietnamese dollar is equivalent to 1.70 yuan National currency).</p>
<p>Hanoi to Lang Son: Take the Vietnamese National Railway train to Lang Son, 154 kilometers from Hanoi. The train departs from Hanoi at 5:50 AM and 0:20 PM daily, taking five and a half hours. Fares are 8.88 Vietnamese dollars for first class, 5.92 Vietnamese dollars for second class, and 2.44 Vietnamese dollars for third class.</p>
<p>Lang Son to Longzhou: Longzhou in Guangxi is 80 kilometers from Lang Son, with public buses available, taking about four hours, with fares around 10 yuan National currency.</p>
<p>Longzhou to Nanning: Nanning is 249 kilometers from Longzhou, with highway buses available, taking one day. Lunch is at Suilu, with a fare of 11.35 yuan National currency.</p>
<p>Nanning to Liuzhou: 260 kilometers away, with highway buses available, taking one day. The fare is 11.70 yuan National currency. (From Liuzhou, you can transfer to Guiyang, Chongqing, etc.)</p>
<p>Liuzhou to Guilin: 242 kilometers away, the highway bus takes about six and a half hours. Lunch is at Lipu, and the fare is 10.90 yuan National currency.</p>
<p>Guilin to Hengyang: 354 kilometers away, the Xiang-Gui Railway train runs a special express and a mixed train once a day, taking more than eleven hours. Fares are 5.30 yuan for third class, 10.60 yuan for second class, and 15.90 yuan for first class.</p>
<p>Hengyang to Changsha: 127 kilometers away, you can take the Yuehan Railway train, taking about eight hours. Fares are 2.40 yuan for third class, 4.80 yuan for second class, and 7 yuan for first class.</p>
<p>(Note) To take the above route, you must have a transit passport through Vietnam and an identification certificate from your employer or business.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Things to Note When Passing Through Vietnam <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Since the interruption of transportation from Hong Kong to the mainland, passing through French Indochina into the mainland has become a well-known, fastest and safest transportation route for Chinese people! Before the War of Resistance, this route was only used by those who wanted to do business or return to their hometowns in Vietnam or Yunnan Province. The general public was unfamiliar with it. Therefore, although this route is now known as a main route to the mainland, most travelers going to the mainland via Vietnam are still first-timers! The transportation situation from Vietnam to Yunnan Province or other places has often been recorded in detail in newspapers, so there is no need to repeat it here. What follows are some things to note:</p>
<p>1.  Passport: Any traveler who wants to go to the mainland and pass through Vietnam must prepare a passport issued by the Chinese government in advance and have it stamped with a transit visa by the French consulate before setting off. After the ship leaves Hong Kong, the passports held must be handed over to the ship's steward, and after arriving in Haiphong, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce can be entrusted to collect them on their behalf. (See last issue for details) When entering the country at Hekou, the identity certificate should be submitted for verification. If there are any doubts, the inspection agency will telegraph the agency or business that issued the certificate to inquire, and will only allow entry after receiving a reply. Therefore, before departure, one should never be negligent about the identity certificate.</p>
<p>2.  Luggage: Vietnamese customs are very strict in inspecting passengers' luggage. Any new items, such as silk, satin, wool, cloth, clothing, cosmetics, etc., will be taxed according to the transit tax rate (1% for domestic goods, 4% for foreign goods). If travelers have newly purchased items, they may wish to take them out as much as possible and put them together, so that when they arrive at customs, they can point them out themselves, wait for the customs officer to review them, and pay the tax that should be paid, and the rest of the luggage can be checked more simply. If new items are secretly wrapped in bedding or clothing lining and are discovered, they will be considered as intentionally evading taxes, and the luggage will be detained and severely punished. Therefore, when carrying bedding, it is best not to sew up one end of the bedding to avoid trouble during inspection. As for lighters, cigarettes, and other prohibited items, they are absolutely prohibited from being brought in.</p>
<p>3.  Wharf: The situation at Haiphong wharf is very chaotic. Passengers should pay special attention. If there are important items, they should be locked in large boxes or wallets, because there are many pickpockets in this port, especially for hats, fountain pens, or pencils, etc. If they are stolen, it will be even more difficult to deal with in this unfamiliar place where the language is not understood, and there are very few sentries and police officers at the port. It is best to travel together and take care of each other. The means of transportation in the urban area of the port are mostly rickshaws. The fare is 5 Vietnamese cents for closer destinations and 10 cents for farther destinations.</p>
<p>4.  Language: The common languages in Vietnam are French, Vietnamese, and Cantonese. Travelers here suffer a lot because they don't understand the language. Generally, people think that English can be used, but this is not the case. Fortunately, China Travel Service has dispatchers at the train station and pier to take care of everything. If there is a time when the language is not understood between the two parties, you can ask the company's dispatcher to translate.</p>
<p>5.  Climate: The climate in Haiphong is very warm. It is already possible to wear single-layer clothing now. When travelers arrive in Haiphong, don't lock up your winter clothes just because the climate is warm, because if you take the train to Kunming, the climate is very cold after the train passes Yongmai. At that time, you can put on the winter clothes you brought to keep warm. As for the climate in Kunming, it is very cool in the morning and evening, and the average temperature is around 70 degrees Celsius at noon.</p>
<p>6.  Diet: The diet in various parts of Vietnam is mostly Western food. The bread used is extremely hard, which people here are not used to. If you want to eat Chinese food, Cantonese cuisine is also available there. When taking the train, meals are not provided on the train, and everything needs to be brought with you. Yunnan and other places in Vietnam, such as Lao Cai, produce a lot of vegetables and fruits at very cheap prices, but do not buy and eat the local fruits, because these fruits are exposed to miasma while growing on the trees, and eating them can easily cause illness. As for food, it is best to bring your own.</p>

<p>— Xu Jun</p>
<p>The American government is holding a summer camp in Flushing Meadow Park, Borough of Queens, New York. All the buildings and scenic areas occupy a vast area of 1,216 acres. In addition to the existing railways and highways that can all directly reach the camp, making transportation very convenient, a new highway directly reaching the camp has now been built. The purpose of this summer camp is divided into two major categories: (1) to provide tourists with a place to escape the summer heat, (2) to invite countries to transport their famous goods for exhibition or sale.</p>
<p>The opening date is approaching, starting from April 30th of this year, for a fixed period of six months, and will close on October 30th of this year. Within the camp area, the government health department also has medical consultants and insurance banks and other agencies, the scope is very great. For travelers departing from China or from Hong Kong to participate, the camp has designated China Travel Service to handle passport procedures for them, and all steamer tickets and train tickets through the mainland to the United States are also sold by China Travel Service. The company also handles export procedures for luggage and goods. In addition, those who are going to New York to visit this summer camp should first prepare a tourist passport and apply for an unlimited immigrant entry permit, which the company can also handle in the same way. Finally, the US government allows imported goods that are only exhibited and not sold within the camp to be exempt from import duties.</p>

From Wangshan, via Changshan, Huabu, and Baisha, to Wuyuan, there is a bus available, and the fare is about 8 yuan.</p>
<p>Announcement: Since this journal opened the "Travel Inquiry" column, we have received a flood of letters from readers with inquiries, like snowflakes. In one week, we have received as many as 623 letters. We have been reading and numbering them every day, and we have hardly had any time to rest, which shows that readers are extremely eager to know the inland transportation situation. However, due to the limited space of this journal, we will first answer the most important ones, and the rest will be disclosed one after another. In addition, there are 35 letters that did not have postage stamps attached. Due to the regulations, we cannot answer them (letters must have this journal's postage stamps attached). Please forgive us! - Editor</p>
<p>Those who send letters to inquire about travel must cut and paste the stamp on the left</p>
<h3 id="e147">Special Features of the Studebaker Champion Car <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Studebaker Champion car produced by the Studebaker factory will arrive in Shanghai in mid-month. The new car has been rigorously tested on roads throughout the United States, under different environmental conditions, for four years before it was successfully announced. Therefore, whether in terms of internal content, appearance, or any aspect, it is worthy of being a masterpiece of the Studebaker factory.</p>
<p>The Champion car is a completely new vehicle, and has not used any parts of other vehicles. Its design and construction are entirely aimed at economic use as the sole purpose, and the selling price is very low. It is truly the most exquisite vehicle in the lowest price range. It is conceivable that the engineers of the factory have exhausted their minds in this product, and their hard work is well worth praising.</p>
<p>The features of the new car are endless, and the most noteworthy is that the mileage per gallon of gasoline reaches 30 miles. The new car has a top speed of 85 miles per hour, and a wheelbase of 110 inches, which is extremely convenient for parking. The car body is spacious and large, enough for five people to sit comfortably. The all-steel body has independent front-wheel suspension, and all styles have a constructed luggage compartment. The overall height of the car is slightly lower and the weight is light, the headlights are mounted on the wing panels, the engine is an L-head six-cylinder type with 21 horsepower, and it has rotary door latches.</p>
<p>This Champion car, which is most suitable for economic conditions, is exclusively managed by Hengtong Automobile Company, a British company at No. 1 Albert Road in this port. It is expected that after arriving in Shanghai, it will be welcomed by people in the automotive industry and will cause great excitement. "Amen."</p>
