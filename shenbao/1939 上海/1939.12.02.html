<p>社評</p>
<h3>貨物之內運外銷問題</h3>
<p>自有淪陷區製品禁止內運之說，頗有以上海租界是否列入淪陷範圍爲問者，而內地貨物之運來上海，亦有時而被「資敵」之名，禁止輸出。上海五方雜處，中外綰轂，具錯綜之情形，處特殊之環境，故言其地位之微妙，旣非上海租界四周之淪陷區所可比擬，亦逈殊於自由中國完全統治下之地域；故居今日而談上海，大可不必問其地位之爲何，而當反躬自省，禁止內運所由來，是否爲政府妨害工商業之懋遷，抑係取締甘爲虎倀者之方法？蓋有奸宄，貪利忘義，實促成之耳。</p>
<p>淪陷區之經濟情况，凋敝衰頹，工商百業僅存生活日用之所必需，此乃侵略者往日焚掠屠殺之後果，抑亦重違其剝削壓榨，以戰養戰之始願者也；故雖威脅利誘，以合作相號召，而實際上則自愛者莫願與之合作，地痞土棍則無可與之合作；圖窮七見，則又假借統制之名，行使霸佔之實，凡百利源，盡收爲己有。華人雖知焦土政策，然當時不及行之，或不忍行之，且又不及撒退者，所剩生產工具，大率復爲利用；名其廠爲華廠，名其貨爲華貨，本資俱非矣。甚且海舶載來，爲之改頭換面，亦稱國廠國貨，以迎華人所好。爲之役使，爲之爪牙者，則又儼然其爲華商。以視寧爲玉碎不爲瓦全，因廠地淪陷存貨告罄，寧願改營他業，光明磊落者，不可以道里計矣。夫涇渭異流，薰蕕殊氣，不可以不分。若因制裁不肯，而使忠藎善良無由吐其氣，則爲是非不明，賞罰不公，志士灰心，奸邪得意，非所以獎掖善類之道也。故嚴杜改裝欺人之商品混入內地，以長經濟侵略之兇燄，在中國言之，不能不確認之爲必要之措施；所應注意者，必先之以嚴密調査，鄭重審核，凡無影戤冒充之形迹，確有一切可信之證明，兼及其產銷之多寡，出納之實况，來源去路，無可啟人以疑竇而能遵照法令辦理者，仍應准其流入內地。並應爲之登報公告，予人以共見共聞。苟有名實不符，自必有人起而正其非。如是，則內地人民需求，不虞缺乏，而混銷亦可絕迹也，</p>
<p>至內地外銷之產物，言其要，固防其資敵，衡其實，正以爲內地民生經濟著想，亦即所以充實抗戰之力量。故物產可以外銷能換取財貨者，不但不阻其流出，且應予以助力。至所謂資敵也者，應以（一）可以充實其軍用者，（二）可以充實其財力者，爲限，此外凡供淪陷區內人民之消費者，無一不在許可輸出之列。庶幾土地雖以軍事之暫時佔領而爲淪陷區，區內居民雖一時失所依恃，生活物資，猶得有所取給：以視飲鴆止渴，猶勝一籌。至內地人民，爲抗戰之中堅；內地物產，爲抗戰之資源；更培植之不遑，允何忍稍加挫折。迺者內地物產，其大宗者亦在統制之列。旣云統制，則事權應求其統一，法令亦期其統一。事權不統一，勢必機關重疊，或有其應辦之責，而無其可辦之力；或有其可辦之權，而啟其爭辦之漸，於是使商賈裏足，貨棄於地，是不宜也。法令不統一，則是非出入，標準難求，執行者旣苦紛繁而無所適從，奉行者又苦徬徨而動輙得咎；是亦不宜也。夫戰時之一切行動，務求其統一，求其敏捷，濡滯實爲害事之媒。以中國幅員廣闊，法制出於中央，而責其成於地方是則務求行政之整飭，汰其不便於民者，而行利民之實。蓋惟有內外維繫，善爲運用，國家與商民，斯得兩全矣。</p>
<h3>羅斯福向蘇芬呼籲　勿轟炸不設防城市　國際崇尚武力言之痛心　駐蘇大使調停促開談判</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統致芬蘭蘇聯兩國元首電、略謂、「近數年來、世界多處地方、均已發生敵對行動、普通人民聚居之地、輒被飛機野蠻轟炸、男婦兒童之無自衛能力者、或被炸死、或成殘廢、動以萬數計、此在文明人視之、莫不深惡痛絕、全人類之意識、亦已爲之震動、當茲可慘的戰事正在進行之際、此種野蠻作戰方式倘被採用、則無辜入民之受殘害者、其數必以萬計、前此余對於大規模作戰各國政府、業已發出呼籲、茲特援照前例、申請貴國政府公開聲明、勿任所屬軍隊在任何情勢之下、轟炸普通人民與未設防城市、唯一保留條件、不外敵方必須如樣辦理」云、（一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統今日接見新聞記者時正式宣稱、蘇聯之侵犯芬蘭、美國深爲震動、此舉已使人類自治之權利陷於危境、此種以武力爲國際爭執仲裁之新手段、各民族應一致予以斥責、武力政策今仍蔓延不已、蠻橫弁髦法律之舉動、今仍在進行之中、令人觸目痛心、芬蘭人民與政府久具有完全和平之成績、已博得美國人民與政府之景仰與熱切關心、有問美國之中立法對蘇芬衝突有無實施之可能性、羅斯福總統未予批評、另有問及美政府是否正在考慮取銷承認蘇聯者、羅斯福總統亦拒絕作答（一日路透）</p>
<p>芬京　新　之主要工作、當然爲與蘇聯重開談判之問題、駐蘇各使館均異常活動、美國使館代表與芬蘭政府代表、在莫斯科曾舉行會議數决、聞美國大使史泰恩哈德、曾警吿莫洛托夫、蘇聯政府若拒絕與芬蘭政府進行談判、則美國將終止蘇美商的、並斷絕邦交云、（一日海通電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　此間外國觀察家頃談稱、美國輿論憤懣蘇聯之處、較之波蘭被侵略時不滿于德國允有甚焉、美國政府感受影響之餘、或當于短時間之內、在外交上有所舉動、共和黨前任總統胡佛已在舊金山發表演說、略謂、芬蘭之被侵略，是即成吉思汗時代之陳舊觀念與大屠殺重見于此日、「文明業已降至最低水準、共產黨進攻芬蘭之日、亦即全世界有智識有德行之男女悲慘之日」、另一方面各報論調亦極爲憤激、民主黨「紐約泰晤士報」載稱、「失敗者並非芬蘭國、乃係俄國的革命、世界各國對于蘇聯政府之剩餘敬意、必因芬蘭之橫被蹂躪而喪失凈盡」、共和黨「紐的民聲講壇報」載稱、「美國人民決當在安全所許可之範圍以內、保待本國和平、固矣、但亦當接受眞理、德蘇兩國在世界上所推動之惡勢力、旣已威脅民治主義之歐洲、實亦危及文明世界、美國縱欲遠離戰事區域、顧對于全世界之興論、實亦在道義上負有應盡之義務、自應以深惡痛絕之旨、指斥全能國所加諸無自衛能力之和平民族之罪行云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　蘇聯進攻芬蘭國事、美國各界人士憤慨同深、國會議員聞知蘇聯飛機轟炸芬蘭國城市多處、大爲震動、議員多人擬于明年一月間國會復會時提出議案、主張與蘇聯斷絕外交關係、所據理由、乃俄國克倫斯某臨時政府時代對美債務、迄未商有解決辦法、美國公民昔在俄國經營之事業、已由蘇聯政府沒收、亦未予以補償、査前此一九三三年美蘇兩國復交時、美國方面原擬以解決往日債務爲先決條件、厥後又作爲罷論、迄今仍未予以解決、有可援爲口實、共和黨參議員范登堡、亦發表談話稱、波蘭與芬蘭兩國事變、接踵而至、為美國計、唯一合理辦法、厥乃不許國社主義共產主義立足于國內、此外外交界人士態度較為溫和、成謂遠東問題已因美日兩國商約行將失效之故而趨于尖銳、美國倘與蘇聯斷絕外交關係、可使蘇日兩國易于接近、遠東問題亦愈難解決、另一方面、政界人士則謂、美國對於日本態度若過于强硬、可使蘇日兩國簽訂條約、俾與德蘇兩國協定相類似、影響所及、日本在中國境內排斥西方各國將愈益積極、蘇聯亦且以各民治國與帝國主義相奮鬥爲口實、從而援助日本、自亦不可不防、歸納言之、美國若果與蘇聯斷絕外交關係、幷在經濟上加以制裁、似爲輿論所樂聞、美國駐蘇大使頗有召回之可能、特此舉所加諸遠東問題之影響、定必爲國務院所顧及云（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國中立法　是否適用於蘇芬　不日將有所表示</h3>

<p>阿姆斯特丹　此間「電聞報」昨夜接到經檢査員通過之柏林電內稱、德國各界對於芬人表示同情，而對於蘇聯勢力在波羅的海之擴張，則深覺惶慮、德外長里賓特羅甫所須給予莫斯科之讓步、以換取蘇聯援助者、今漸揭曉、德國旣犧牲波羅的海諸國、蘇聯復進一步而作在芬蘭瑞典與挪威茲由行動之要求、德國於此又退讓不遑、蘇聯勢力之如此膨脹、極為德國海陸軍界所不滿、陸軍固不忘昔年德人與芬人並肩作戰以制俄國而恢復芬蘭獨立之日、而海軍亦因戰略上理由惶恐不安云、（一日路透電）</p>

<h3>偽市府在愚園路　強迫向住戶收捐　對外僑未敢擅行收取　收得捐稅確額不宣佈</h3>
<p>字林報云、「上海市府財政局」收捐員、昨（三十日）在界外馬路區內愚園路開始徵收「房捐」、據「局」員昨日午前傳稱、收捐未過困難、住戶納捐者、不乏其人云、惟所收捐稅之確額、則未宣佈、「市府」方面今認界外馬路區在其管理之下、惟對於該區</p>
<p>外僑住戶</p>
<p>與店主及經理、將不收房捐、蓋此項問題之談判、仍在未決期間也、「財政局」徵收員偕同市警已赴愚園路區收捐、拒不納捐者將被拘辦、所微捐額、以房租率計算、商店爲百分之十一、住戶爲百分之九、據宜佈、微收員在其他</p>
<p>界外馬路</p>
<p>收捐者、巳非一日、但昨日始赴愚園路、外人僑居該路者頗多、但未有徵收員向彼等收取「冬季房捐」、按江灣「官員」於多週前即已宣佈微收房捐、但遲遲未實行、旋宣佈外僑亦在納捐之列、界外馬路問題之談判、雖仍在進行中、但「市府」竟</p>
<p>首次承認</p>
<p>開始收捐矣、據「新申報載稱、自去歲三月間、設「西區稽微處一以來收取「房捐」工作、進行順利、惟居住界外馬路區而賴工部局之保護者、則拒不繳納、實屬有損法紀、雖有一二住戶自動繳納、但爲數甚少、周「局長」不能滿意、乃於日前令西區辦事處亦在滬西界外馬路區開始徵收、</p>
<h3>日方扣留華捕　意在威嚇</h3>
<p>兩華捕被僞法院「審訊」中公共租界華捕兩名、上月十九日在勞勃生路執行職務時、與謀偽員發生沖突、竟遭日憲兵拘去、雖經捕房總巡鮑恩少校、向日方嚴重抗議、迄未獲釋、據外人方面相信、日方將該兩華捕扣押不放、其用意在威嚇其他執行職務之華捕、至該華捕被扣後、日方並曾於廿四日交與中山路僞「地方法院滬西分院」一度「審訊」、茲聞將再交極司非而路九十二號新設之僞「地方法院滬西分院辦事處」續加「審訊」、惟究以何種「罪名」控訴、則未能確悉、偽「椎事」爲劉某、</p>
<h3>日方積極獲取　捲烟營業　虹口設廠五處　牌名達十餘種</h3>
<p>日方現圖積極推廣戰區捲烟業、以便將原有行銷江南一帶之中外商出品各牌香烟之潛勢力、取而代之、據查虹口區域內、先後開出之日商烟廠、共有五家、廠址均屬戰前華商所有、一為華生第一廠、地址在虹口保定路昆明路、即前中原烟廠原址、一爲華生第二廠、在塘山路愛而考克路、即前新華烟廠原址、一為華生第三廠、在保定路塘山路、即前正大套鞋廠（機件由前南洋華成二廠中搬去）、三廠共有華工二千餘人之譜、一爲東亞烟廠、在塘山路保定路、即前華東烟廠原址、一爲共盛烟廠、在華德路華成路、即前中南烟廠原址、兩廠共有華工一千六七百人、上述五廠、出品之新牌捲烟、共達十數種之多、均在淪陷區內、積極推廣銷路、</p>
<h3>英軍瓜代　新軍搭德生輪到滬　一部分轉赴秦皇島</h3>
<p>怡和洋行德生輪、此次由港來滬、儎有英軍三隊、的一百五十餘人、係乘原船赴秦皇島接防、其中一部到滬後、即登陸與在滬之某隊央軍更調、該輪將來貨卸淸後、定今日儎央軍赴秦皇島、故本埠並不裝貨、</p>
<h3>日發言人聲稱　與汪成立協議　謂汪同意不撤駐軍</h3>
<p>日大使館發言人鶴見憲、昨日下午、在新聞報道席上聲稱、「日本政府與「新中央政權」首腦在精衛間、關於經濟合作之基礎程序、業已成立協議、日本並已同意在可創立一堅强與獨立之政府、而在汪則同意日本不撤退其</p>
<p>駐華軍隊</p>
<p>「新南京政府」之延遲成立、係因現方進行强化各種必需事務之故、此點實有前例、可爲諸君援例以證明之、當美國革命戰爭之後、幼稚之民主國、曾幾經繁重之過程、而始組成其</p>
<p>政府機構</p>
<p>今之創立「新政權」、可謂與此事係同一範疇」、關於此點、昨晚據某美國時論家評稱、「該發言人顯有比擬不當者、藍美利堅民主國之耩締、係藉</p>
<p>自己力量、而抗　侵犯者之妄想、至「新中央政權」、則依賴侵略者之奧援耳」、在新聞報道席上、外籍記者並曾詢及、「汪氏最近用無綫電廣播、勸誘華軍前綫將士、背棄國民政府、而投在氏麾下、未知</p>
<p>有否反應</p>
<p>日陸軍發言人起而代答一已有反應、惟甚小耳、業有馮某者、」（恐即係指黃大偉）領導其二萬人之軍隊、願爲注効力」、該發言人經追詢後答稱、「余不能發表馮某之活動所在地、惟可以奉吿者、即馮某「得日陸軍之允許」、而在日軍佔領區之外活動也」、（大中社）</p>
<h3>華軍勁旅　控制澱山湖　青浦日軍進攻失利　朱家角日宣佈戒嚴</h3>
<p>蘇浙邊界自華方正規軍第三十師與四十五旅田岫山部會合後、聲勢浩大、上月曾重創來自嘉善之日軍五百餘名於西塘（在嘉善西北二十里）陶莊之間、事後日方利用空軍報復、致西塘·花涇·天凝莊·洪溪·丁甸廟·等窰業區域、多數民房被燬、華軍乃以神奇戰略、由四十五旅規復西塘、威脅</p>
<p>滬杭鐵路</p>
<p>綫、三十師向北挺進、控制澱山湖之東南岸、迫近章練塘與朱家角、於是直接使松江靑浦兩縣日軍不安、間接威脅滬市西南郊、日軍即由靑浦縣城警備隊、並獲得上海方面派去之援軍、的共三百餘名、越朱家角向西南進發、於前三日在澱山湖畔</p>
<p>葉舍夾岸</p>
<p>之三角地區、與華軍接觸、華方挾有優勢兵力、並有砲隊協助、雙方搏鬥至力、爲西塘一役後之第二次激戰、近外報所傳本市西南郊鄰縣境內發生戰事之說、亦由此而來、隆隆砲聲、在靑浦朱家角一帶、淸晰可聞、激戰達一晝夜之久、日軍因傷亡慘重、師勞無功、仍退回靑浦縣城、當交戰時、該處鄉民</p>
<p>紛紛避難、流亡載道、現經華軍當局撫綏、已陸續返歸、現華軍勢力、繼續向東北擴展、故靑浦朱家角一帶、均宜佈戒嚴、</p>
<h3>郵局限用女職員事　交部覆電　規定範圍內　仍可收女性</h3>
<p>上海各婦女團體為此次郵局限用女性郵員事、曾一再力爭、昨接交部覆電云、現值非常時期、郵運事務日趨繁重、各局現有女性職員、多已分配工作、故於最近招考郵員、不得不暫加限制、以應當前實際需要、但各局在規定範圍內、仍可兼收女性、對於女子職業問題、亦能兼顧、等情、聞各婦女團體對於是項辦法、認為未能滿意、仍在繼續力爭中、</p>
<h3>中比美金公債　抽籖竣事　計二十一萬餘美元　明年起由銀行付款</h3>
<p>一九一八年中比美金公債第二十四决還本、於昨日下午四時在外灘華比銀行舉行抽籤、到華比銀行華經理胡筠秋·公債部主任A.Lampo.唐文頤Thomson會計師及跑馬總會代表、此次共抽籤十二支、總計二千一百三十四張、每張票面美金百元，應還本二十一萬三千八百元美金、抽中各籤定民國二十九年一月一日起開始付款、茲將中籤號碼及張數錄後、計「七五」號三百四十九張、「八九」號四百三十二張、「五〇號四百七十四張、「四八」號四百三十張、「一五」號三百四十五張、「六二五」號四十五張、「〇〇四九」號五張、「二〇五五」號五張、「〇七二二」號五張、「三九五一四」號地張、「三一七二五」號一號、「四五五四九一號一張、總共二千一百三十四張、</p>
<h3>滬廿餘廠棉布運菲　悉遭扣留　因有大量日貨坯布　由滬轉運赴菲混銷</h3>
<p>最近斐律賓方面、對於由滬運人棉布、檢查甚嚴、因該埠抗檢會曾據報吿、有大量日貨坯布、由滬轉運赴菲混銷、所有由滬運往之恒豐·國光·九豐·元豐·大新振·公勝·乾豐·光中·同豐·中國·天生·瀛洲·鴻大昌·裕新·中一·中國·九新·國信·榮華·綸華·恒昇·華東·等二十餘印染廠品之棉布、現已悉數扣留限三十天以內、提出有力證明、方可酌核放行、茲聞此事現由出口商聯合會函請上海市商會調查辦理、並先由商會專電斐律賓中國總領事館、在調查期內、暫緩處分、</p>
<h3>續訂貢米　成交廿萬包　昨德生輸運到一萬四千餘包　米價漲多跌少公會擬議抑止</h3>
<p>大批洋米繼續到滬、巳誌前報、茲悉昨晨怡和洋行德生輪抵滬、亦有大批洋米自香港運來、計一萬四千七百十七包、該輪停靠新開河羅斯福碼頭、正在起卸中、</p>
<p>貢米續訂</p>
<p>二十萬包</p>
<p>自本市米糧價格步漲後、一般行號及公園、俱向西貢訂購、第一批之二萬餘包、已於前日到滬、而在途中絡續運滬者、尙有多批、滬市各米行業以國米來源旣不能暢通、時受阻碍、而價値亦不見下落、遂請由法商達孚洋行向西貢再度訂購貢米二十萬包、以應滬市民食、聞貢米成交每包的一百九十斤、折價每石近三十元、今日市塲開價則爲三十五元、</p>
<p>來源不斷</p>
<p>在貢米源源來滬、及各產米區運輸未見阻斷時、而滬市米價非特不見下落、反而逐日步漲、殊爲一般市民所懷疑、大中社記者特因此而走訪米業中某君、據談、淪陷區中產米區域、如蘇·嘉·常·錫·崑等地、採辦運輸雖見困難、但尙未完全阻斷、每日到貨平均在六千包左右、至於安慶蕪湖、則祇准日商三井洋行採辦「軍米」外、其餘客商行號、」概不得前往該處採購、即領有採辦證、亦不許裝運來滬、但三井洋行之所謂「軍米」者、事實上十之七八、亦係由日商轉輾運至租界區待沽者、故此次米價反常之飛漲、其關鍵不在於來源之受阻、蓋尙有其他因素也、</p>
<p>漲價原因</p>
<p>仍在囤積</p>
<p>滬市米價全係米市場管理委員會視來源之多寡而規定、但管委會之實權、則操之於經售公會及行家、在戰前市場上之行家、不過代客買賣、從中提取每石一角五分之佣金、况交通暢達、根本無實權能操縱市價、自戰後則一反常規、藍滬上行家的共一百餘家、自江浙產米區相繼淪陷後、逐日到貨、俱可預計、故能操縱裕如、宅心仁厚之行家、以民食爲前提者、當亦不在少數、但「惟利是圖」者、比比皆是、如以滬上一百家行家、每家囤米三百包計、則已有三萬包、到貨俱被壟斷、加以業外人之囤積、米價又安得不逐日飛漲哉、</p>
<p>公會集議</p>
<p>貢獻意見</p>
<p>上海市米號業同業公會、以米價上漲、影響民食至鉅、僉認若不再採取有效辦法、壓制此種漲風、則因循蔓延、後息何堪設想、該會雖無實權制定價格、戢此囂亂市面、但貢獻意見、或能爲管委會所採取也、査在市塲購米規則期限十天、到期付款提貨、故在此十天期內、市價大有變化、一般掮客行商、每多乘機居奇操縱、該會特於前日集議補救辦法、擬徵求豆米行業同意、向市塲管委會提出、請即縮短期限、蓋期限縮短後、則無實力之掮客行商、不能居奇操縱、如此則或能收效於一時、</p>

<h3>二批分幣劵將發行　各業領用辦法　銀錢業各公司得直接領用　其他各業向往來行莊兌取</h3>
<p>中中交農四行爲根本救濟輔幣券之缺乏恐慌、由中央銀行上海分行呈請總行核准、委託香港美商永寗公司承印一分五分大量分幣券、業已趕印、隨時解交該上海分行、準八日起遂漸發行、凡銀行錢莊（銀錢業公會會員）以及各大公司各大商店、均得備函向該行領兌、其他各業均向其往來戶（銀行錢莊）領用、惟小錢莊及烟兌店暫停供給、至於各公司商號及電車公司之代價券、應於二批分幣發行後、即可自動收回、因代價券之發行、事前未經財政部之核准、當不能認爲合法、</p>

<h3>公共汽車鋁幣杭州亦復通行　發行鋁幣價值達十萬元　但公司終未能收回原幣　明年增闢路綫疏通乘客</h3>
<p>字林報云、本市各公共車輛公司、鑒於輔幣缺乏、已發出一分至五分不等之代價券、英商中國公共汽車公司則因防杜假造代價券起見、乃斥巨資購買機械製造幣値不等之鋁質代用幣、公司方面原度此等鋁質代用幣、終可收回、</p>
<p>镕成鋁條</p>
<p>而製造公共汽車車身與輕余屬製成之其他配備、蓋代用幣之鋁價殆不較幣面價値爲低也、但迄今爲止、所發鋁幣價値、已逾十萬元、而絕無收回留下者、且聞遠如杭州、亦通行此種鋁幣、英商中國公共汽車公司今繼續日發鋁幣</p>
<p>約三萬枚</p>
<p>入晚售票員向公司交款時、僅見少許鋁幣而已、公司方面爲與公衆竭力合作起見、刻正研究補救赫法、必須以新方法應付嚴重現局、若繼續發行鋁幣、則須添購設備與鋁、始克應付要求，發行代價券問題、亦已加以討論、但恐假造者</p>
<p>逞機圖利</p>
<p>故未實行、目下之情况旣若是、公共汽車搭客因售票員無輔幣找換、故不購票而下車者頗多、公司方面因此損失不貲、希望公衆儘可能予以合作、而减輕售票員之職務、自明年起、將</p>
<p>闢十六路</p>
<p>公共汽車、自宜昌路起、經戈登路·新　路·卡德路·愛文義路·大通路·白克路·成都路·威海衛路與跑馬廳路而至虞洽卿路爲止、由單層公共汽車行駛、聯絡公共租界之西北部與中心區、而减輕本市尖銳的公共車輛載送問題、</p>

<p>個人道德</p>
<p>吾人固　改造當今不良社會、以求人類幸福、若個人道德掃地、則人必不信其所言所爲、則失敗自所難免、重整道德之目的、果欲求重建世界改造社會、但必須從個人之道德重整着手、去除腐化習慣、改變不良生活、以絕對誠實、絕對純潔、絕對無私、絕對博愛四大原則、爲生活之準繩、</p>
<p>身體力行</p>
<p>努力奮鬥、於上帝管理之下、改變整個世界、是故，目前靑年必須認淸當今困難所在、勿一任感情之衝動、而必須知過改過、推己及人、而今日敎育亦必須以訓練道德人才爲職責、培植良好靑年、作開闢世界新園地之先鋒一、據悉今日該運　仍照規定時間播音、由本埠職　界人士及數醫師主講、各界仕女、可準時收聽、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來漲風甚燬、昨晨開盤即形堅定、投機者在市大量購買、且海外利物浦及孟買來電俱告上騰、因之人心異常興奮、現貨商亦因交易衆多，甚為活躍，因之市况頗為堅定、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起六七至十六磅音不等、印度連同預測又漲十八羅比、埃及漲六十餘磅音、利物浦漲二十五便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、最近各方俱以海外棉市飛漲、棉紗亦因血被其拖起、前日申新開出棉鈔近萬件、故昨日購進美棉八九千包、日商廠方、日前因有印度帮紗商以印棉激漲過巨、折合成本太高，故向日廣購辦棉紗一萬數千件、昨日日廠亦搜得美棉萬餘包、俱為即裝者、茲將昨日美棉價格以美匯七元七五、折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>交通阻梗　紗銷華南不暢　市盤原棉數漲</h3>
<p>紗市平　、但現紗鎖路未暢、華南贈南因運輸不　做捷、交　　　、故採辦者依盤滯雌、南請尙在徘徊之境、惟　美棉市一　升南、大有漲無止境之象、就此而踰厚補脚地致昂、紗市當有前進、無奈銷費不　、所以　力衆見劇烈也、上日中新九庭關出之額冷數為一萬〇四百包、</p>
<p>現紗晨訓人氣一致望高、謂壽外棉市一　飛漲、預料紗價應當上升、開價漲四五元、二十支雙馬價為六百七十七元、此價一開聲喊者紛紛　　、但實際消化仍屬不良、不久又復圖下、又有一說、以近來廠方額子開出太多、一般經商者　中皆有棉紗也，查半日間成交統計一千〇八十三包、行情二十支雙昆匯四元、天女漲二元半、　地球漲一元、查棉紗今（二日）有八十件、還往暹羅、又八十件、這往土樂、又二百六十五件、總往書港、又一百零五件、這厦門、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　八三〇　七〇　江西　三〇</p>
<p>內地　一三〇　寗波　三〇　統計一、〇八四</p>
<h3>糧食　米蠹興風作浪　猝遭洋米當頭一棒　囤戶立時歛手不遑</h3>
<p>米市目前午一度轉緊後、昨到貨由火車遭到崑太蘇同等貨二十餘車、故人心更盛、客服大都鑒於隔昨情形、堅神不脫、造成投機家機會、自初開即將手中獲利之貨、喊高脫去、一方着手揀廉價收進、一時形勢頓亂、激動一般人心、均在望好、紛紛跟踪直追、爭相問津、客販遂得扳銷、霎時無論粳尖價立升一元，同時囤戶納意亦愈濃、乘高拉進、本鄉店冒以時近冬至、已臨積備之期、為恐市面在操縱下再無回小之望、互相採購、故迄中市各價愈漲愈烈、巳升至二元左右、當此一路飛勝、一般擁有巨數洋米之北洋帮、初本均在執貨觀望、乘彼投機家之操縱、因諸市局轟動，隆將大批洋米推出、喊價三十五元、實售三十四元七角、市面立受打擊、作客大都正興高彩烈、猝遭悶棍、均即掃興、無意再進、而一般投機家　覺痛心、本可獲意外之利、茲則徒呼奈何、誠亦操縱者應得之果報、所以晚市形勢頓見轉懈、統計收盤行情、以早市漲勢甚猛、無論粳需各尖又較前市悉升一二元不等矣、</p>
<p>客種承前日漲風、開市即見膿漲、而匯戶納胃仍貪、早市一度加起一元三五角、旋以洋米新交易成　、前定者不日可到、　有一部份獲利行團隨市售出、後市始見回小四五角、然高蕪秈仍開至三十四元七角、惟到銷兩少、統市祇有二千多包、</p>
<p>洋米晨間漲風甚厲，行國舖作續辦外、又被外滙影響、大戶吸收愈力、西貢安南粳暹運等均開至三十五元左右至三十五元半、旋以新交易續妥二批、晨間激漲元外者乃又回降四五角、按昨日由建源售出五百噸、價三十九元半、達孚售出六七百噸、一號價三十九元、又二號西貢三十七元半、</p>
<p>洋米賡續到滬、昨日怡和洋行德生輸、由香港運來洋米一萬四千七百十七包、起卸於金利源碼頭棧房、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠盤　再升二角　麥價達十二元半</h3>
<p>粉市再度提漲、二號船廉盤已據七元八角、較前日又升二角、董由於時馬動盪、物價頻升、除本容銷化一致活動外、兼有囤戶在市　收、人心更覺望好、各庭售童益　、故二號粉本醫　堆二角、跑車容　竟有開亟八元外者、其他內地紛及日廠風里牌等粉、亦均帶好一二角不等、乾市盛交總計五萬餘包、實銷約佔半數、其餘均係投機性質、日下各廠對此甚為注意、故仍　制大量供給云、</p>
<p>小麥來源仍稀、因自下產價頻升、及粉市廠盤再高聲中、執貨者當然居奇　積、不觀輕說、紙肯零星略為供應、故廢冐難食、終無大帮數量可辦、結果擯持不辦、惟市塲交易、其有五車、計開無錫小麥十二元四角至二角七分、蘇州小麥竟開至十二元五角、又創新高價、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆華南動辦　芝廠囤戶胃香</h3>
<p>黃豆　維糧市塲中之人心、仍居騷挺、行市大都輪續上　、大局尚未見衰、昨日黃豆行情再昂二角餘、銷塲除本街廠家囤戶外、華南星加彼等亦有問津、計開蚌埠豆二車、價為十六元、崇明沙黃大百餘包、價自十五元七角至十大元、蕪湖豆二百包、價為十五元五角，南京豆二車、價為十五元三角至五角、江北豆百餘包、價為十四元三角、</p>
<p>芝蔴　實銷仍不動、交易雖熱鬧、但完全為囤戶之胃，計成交漢口二百五十包、價群市價攔、常州蔴二百包、揚州蔴百餘包、南京蔴六十包、管店雪蔴五十包、安慶蔴五十包、九江奶蔴三十包、</p>
<p>豆子昨（一日）由北沙來六百三十五包、今日則有一百八十五包、瓶往厦門、又四千七百二十包、又生仁三百六十包、運往香港、生油五百聽及四十件亦建香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　赤糖成交大盛</h3>

<h3>夫婦知識　男子虧弱將難為丈夫</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚堵培　性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息、</p>
<p>身為男子，就得難赳赳氣昂昂，精強力壯。所謂「鬍眉男子」，不特在事業上可以發生一種威力，俾人一望而知其為堂堂男子漢，而運籌帷幄，指揮裕如；同時在婦女們的心目中，也最心愛這種偉丈夫。爾時如鐵，柔時如綿，情深似海，幸福若仙，這真是嬌娃們靈塊的主宰者，精神營養的供給者，如此男子，才不愧為男子漢與偉丈夫！反之，男子若於早年浪漫，犯有手淫，同性愛等惡癖，或患遺精而因循失治，或早婚多妻，荒淫縱慾，把生殖腺內分泌液消耗枯竭者，則凡早洩陽痿，發育不全，腎虧乏嗣，腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰駿背痛，神經衰弱等症即不一而足。此種男子類多體貌不揚，面黃肌瘦，精力萎靡，或者外強中乾，未勞先倦，怕寒畏難，固在學術上事業上受着嚴重的影響，有陷於失敗的危臉，就是在夫婦間性生活上亦必不能美滿，或竟完全不能人道，這怎能不引起美人心中的憎恨，而陷愛情於破裂！我們率直言之，夫婦是性關係的結合，性生活的美滿可以奠定夫婦間愛情的基礎，若性生活而不能協調或口惠而實不至，這更下如無。世間夫婦的勃谿爭吵，或竟演出私通，私奔，別居離婚等慘劇，我人試以銳利的眼光分析之，什九必有根本的性關係之原因在。</p>
<p>虧弱男子將難為丈夫！恐簡直難為人！世事之紛繁，責任之鉅重，不有精力以奮鬥，只有被洶汰而已！惟虧弱亦有法可以預防與補救。據最新醫學上的論斷，上述種種虧弱症象，如能採用生殖腺內分泌補給療法，亦可收「手回春」之效。雄壯動物生殖素製劑「生殖素」根據此種原理提取猩猩，熊鹿，海狗等體中的生殖腺內分泌精華，用科學複製法製成，其中成分完全保存。所以品質貴重，功效確實，為任何類似製劑所不及。服後於－日夜間即生精補腎，健腦活血，連服不斷，則更助長發育，滋補神經，上述各症可於煙期內根本痊愈。連服－冬，可使體重繪加，延年益壽，中老年人常服可收返老暹童之奇效。惟有遺精者須兼服治遺聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速！息者如能親來本診所兼施電療注射等新療術，更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3>健美　乳峯美在冬季</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚祟培</p>
<p>有人說：一到冬天，女子的健美兩個字，便無所顯現了。其寔不然。董女性的健美與否，不但熱天衣衫單薄的時候，可以因曲線美的豐富，斷知其健美。即在寒風砭骨，重衰不溫的時候，也許夠使人一望而知。你講：身體健美的女郎，她們不但面色紅潤，肌膚細膩，一些不現粗糙或灰白析裂，就是姿態方面，衣服無論怎樣穿得厚，胸前還是有兩個饅頭似的乳峯，不畏束轉地隱然高聳起來，同時臀部方面，也顯得豐膄而柔美。根本不因衣服的笨重，而障碍其可愛的曲線。至於身體瘦弱，患有月經病，白帶症，貧血，營養不良，多產體虧，因而乳峯萎瘡，健美喪失者，則在此寒風凜冽的冬季，她們的本身，即感覺特別的畏冷，而在旁人眼裏，更見得她們瘦損可憐！面上縱然滿塗脂粉，可是一到這個冷天，它就毫不客氣的浮泛起來。斑斑塊塊，依然露出裏面慘自的臉色，雖然穿着很華麗的旗袍，後身竟然成了直綫，而胸口比熨斗燙過尤平，這樣的女性，就是呌老眼婆娑的老頭兒看，他也知道是不健美的。即使妳用盡心機來盧偽裝點，可是到了蘭湯浴罷，一室生春的房閒里，難道還能裏上厚衣，來遮這個醜態嗎？抑有進者。當『寒宵低垂銷金帳，鶯意衾里效雙飛』時，更將何所遁形，所以『真金不怕火來燒』，弄巧作偽，總于要歸失敗。唯一最可靠的方法，莫如乘此進補時期，進服卵巢內分泌製劑女用『生殖素』。則服後一日在間，即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續連服一季，不惟萎痿的乳峯，能使其隆然高聳，同時能將組織萎黃的肌膚，變成自嫩細膩，其功效之大，決非市上類似之製劑所可同日而語，而強身駐額，恐參茸珠粉，亦不足與之抗衡，因此譽滿全球，前進女性，均認為是她們健美的唯一恩物。</p>
<h3>遺精症的根本療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念會</p>
<p>「七年之病，求三年之艾」。這是說疾病必須作根本治療，最為得計。若只圖目前表面上的見效，那病不除根，反貽後息！按青年人的所以惠遺精。大都因犯手淫，同性愛，早婚，荒淫等行為，摧殘了性神經，使精關鬆弛之故。在晚間睡夢時因受性刺激而起之遺精，這尙是輕症的夢遺症。此時若因循失治，那涓滴不塞，會潰成江海，因精關的日益鬆弛，很有釀成滑精漏精症的可能。精液在生理上即所謂生殖腺內分泌液。其中成份包含着多量的腦下垂體，腎腺，副腎服，睾丸腺等多種貴重的原質。如遺洩不止，不特直接虧損元氣，斷傷生殖機能，且影響發育，减退新陳代謝，於是凡早洩陽萎，發育不全，腎虧乏嗣，腦弱健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，未老先衰等症即不一而足。此種青年，勢必萎靡不振，為學生者學業必落人後，即有退學失學之虞！從事於工商界</p>
<p>職業者，所任職務必感難能勝任之苦，亦有失職失業的危險！兼之體貌不揚，面黃肌瘦之故，在交際塲中恒為異性所棄，在夫婦生活上每為妻憎恨，由此而演出家庭悲劇墮入人生苦海中者，亦何可勝數！所以遺精患者及早作根本治療，實為刻不容緩之圖。治療之法，唯有速服世界馳名治遣聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」，則於當夜即可收安眠止遺之特效。因此劑係由德國醫聖希米脫博士所秘製，確有鞏固精關，鎭靜神經之奇功。息者服用，可以萬試萬靈。惟在今日仿置偽製之劣藥充斥之際。購服時，務須認清「希米脫」字樣，免為蒙混，以致貽誤！惟遺精巳久有上述虧損症象者，須兼服雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以根本培補腦腎，增益精血，連服一冬，必可使百病霍然，體重增重，延年益壽。患者如能親來本診所兼施電療注射等新療術，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>研究和盲從</h3>
<p>— 徐中介</p>
<p>語文展覽會已閉幕了。在文學的觀點上，我們認爲那裏最有價値的陳列品，是那些一銅器」「甲骨」「黑匋」上的文字。甲骨文字和銅器文字之應用在研究新經學的途徑上，實在是近三百多年來，研究經學的新進步。所以這决語文展覽的公開徵求和展覽，假使能在硏究經學上得到收穫，這便是在文學上最大的收穫了。</p>
<p>這裏是一些關於硏究經學的啟蒙知識。</p>
<p>經舉是在任何文學部門中，最難硏究的東西。據王國維先生所歸納的理由有三個：第一是譌闕。第二是古語和今語不同。第三是成語。在漢代到淸初，學術研究的過程上，雖然把「經學」作爲牛要材料，但都走錯了研究經學的途徑。漢學派注重家法和師說，不把經學作爲文學研究的材料；而把牠作爲經咒看待。而經學到了宋派手中，他們借着經學來講他們的理學；憑一種理想臆解來解釋經學。所以幾千年來，雖把經書讀得沸騰了，但都在半懂半不懂的狀態下曲解和臆說着。直到淸代，扌把研究經學的方法，走到考據的路上去；這就是所謂「訓詁」「虛實」「譬如」等方法。這樣經過三百年的努力，方扌對經學的硏究，比較有一點進步。但到淸來時候，經學學者王國維還坦白的吿訴我們，他對詩經有十分之一二不懂。書經有十分之四五不懂。傳斯年也說。：「六經在專門家手中也是半懂半不懂的東西。」到最近有了文法學的帮助，有了銅器文字，甲骨文字的參證，經學方扌走上了用科學方法整理的道路。雖然有了不少新的進步，新經學家有了許多新的貢獻，但不了解的地方，還很多。的確，在事實上，不僅經學的難讀難懂是這樣，就是一般所謂古文，假使我們把讀書標準提髙些，也不是一般「略讀詩書」的人們</p>
<p>然而離奇的事實，普遍的出現在現在的中小學敎育中。這種事實正普遍的在蔓衍起來。我們暫把經學古文的內容，對中小學生的液輸，在思想上智能上能否接受的錯誤拋開不談，即從根本問題上談，那些賢明的　師們（？）自己本身根本對經學古文尙是半懂半不懂的東西，自己對聲音文字訓詁考據等學識，尙不知爲何物；他們能用什麼萵明的方法，來讀解古文經學呢？來給小學生們了解呢？我現在把「復李眉生書」裏面幾個「辭」和「字」給一般沒有聲音文字訓詁學的敎師們認一認，自己坦白的估量一下，自己配不配敎授講解經史和古文。</p>
<p>例一：一春朝朝日，秋月。一——見漢書。</p>
<p>（註）「朝日」的「朝」，「夕月」的「夕」，當作祭祀解。</p>
<p>例：「入其門無人門焉者，入其閨無人閨焉者。」——見公羊傳。</p>
<p>（註）「門焉者」的「門」，一閨焉者」的「閨」，當作看守解。</p>
<p>例三：「步有新船。」——見韓文。</p>
<p>（註）「步，同埠。（爲假借。）</p>
<p>例四：「高門懸薄。」——見莊子。</p>
<p>（駐）「薄」作「帷」解。（假借義。）</p>
<p>例五：「不宿怨。」——見（假借義）</p>
<p>（駐）「宿」作留解。（引申義）</p>
<p>例六：「旣有淫威。」——見詩經。</p>
<p>（註）「淫」作大解。</p>
<p>例七：「黨。」——見說文。</p>
<p>（註）不鮮明也。（象形）例八：「四牡孔阜。」——見爾雅。</p>
<p>例九：「路門。」——見爾雅。</p>
<p>（註）「路」，「阜」均作大解。（引申義）。</p>
<p>這些解釋，還不是新經學家認爲滿意的解釋。那些經史古文的難讀是可知了。胡適說：「在今日妄談讀經和古文，或中小學讀經和古文，都是無知之談。不値得通人一笑。」這話很中肯。在現在，我希望賢明的敎師們，趕快放下那些裝鬥面的經史和古文，多給予中小學生一些充實有用的知識吧！</p>
<h3>山城的轟炸——戰地追記——</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>由於豫鄂兩路進攻的碰壁，六安一綫也被遏止於葉集，不能動彈，只得出於洩憤一法，濫施轟炸了。正如江湖上的「英雄」一樣，當他空手而回之前，必須拉一决屎在什麽地方，以示「英雄」的畢竟「不凡」。而且毀滅之先，公式是不會推板的，常然先行偵察，　散傳單，那麽婉委巧妙的字句，配合着五顏六色的紙頭，儘管讓自己把腰帶束緊肚皮，這浪費是毫不吝嗇的。</p>
<p>居民不滿兩萬的山城，人口可以無須疏散，老早就搬光了。在被毀滅的那天，最初三架，砰砰砰——於是周圍不到五里的縣城，便浸沉在灰褐色的烟霧由，噴射着硫磺的濃烈氣息；宇宙是靜消消的。衹有岩石着彈後發出的吼聲，似乎在說，滾吧，懦弱的家伙！</p>
<p>前三架帶着頽喪的神情議羽而歸，繼續出現於空際的，又是三架，據說這就呌作「輪炸」；而半小時以後，再來三架，石頭和炸彈搏擊的聲音，便延長到向午光景，「輪炸」方扌終了，西南半城的烈燄，果然熊熊地上衝了。</p>
<p>「燒夷彈！媽的！……」</p>
<p>一直延燒到傍晚，火勢仍沒有退，東門外的縣府附近，變成一片焦土，許許多多倒坍的房屋堆裏，都在冒着白烟，那山脚下的飛機洞口，躺着五六個斷頭折臂的屍體，自然是不及躱避的犧牲者；但這之外，誰都沒有受傷，誰都和平常一樣，所不同的，留下了毀滅的深刻印象，烙在各人的心頭，敎你澈底地認識着「英雄」的面目。</p>
<p>山城似乎毀滅了，大別山是永遠頑強地存在着，高聳雲　的山峰，正如勇士伸出的無數鐵拳，彷彿擎住了澄碧的靑天，不，它在準備擊落那落山的太陽，當救護隊從東郊歸來，突然傳來一陣宏壯的歌聲：山城，轟炸了的山城！莫低頭歎息，宛轉呻吟！撫摩着新的創傷——重新開拓光明的途徑！在火花之中——來創造你新的生命！山城，磨厲你鋒芒的齒牙哺除瘴霧，呑烏噬雲，恢復大別山　永久的　寧靜</p>
<h3>躍</h3>
<p>— 科蒙</p>
<p>落葉沙沙的旋着，又飛着；像雪，像蝴蝶。</p>
<p>呻吟繞着屋頂打着顫。牆壁，桌子，床鋪，地板，一句話，一切屋里的陳設彷彿都哭喪着臉，缄默而且灰色。讓那一聲聲孤戰戰的咳嗽碰着牠們又撞回來。</p>
<p>「覺得好些沒有？」我忍不住走近那床沿，握緊他發熱的手。</p>
<p>咳嗽代巷着回答，床鋪，人，屋子都吟呻着，彷彿在忍受一個苦難，一個世界將要爆烈的苦難。</p>
<p>黃昏垂在窗外了，風噓着，但吹不掉這屋子里的呻吟。</p>
<p>口渴麼？要不要喝點開水？</p>
<p>在渾茫茫的燈光下，他搖搖頭。</p>
<p>我凝望着那逐漸深陷下去的眼睛，啊，那眼睛，那眼睛，仍然閃着倔强的光。</p>
<p>「你爲什麽這舷看着我？」一絲苦笑掠過他蒼白的嘴角：「我並沒有病，我知道自己是生活在一個什麼年代里，一個什麼環境里，我携着健全的身心，從南到北，從北到南，奔走着……挨着一切艱辛，企圖將自己以及另外一些被壓迫者從一隻榨子上解放出來，但偶然的『不幸』把我趕到這死港來，牠奪去了我的活躍。咳————咳——……</p>
<p>我呆立着，說不出半句安慰的話。</p>
<p>「但是我還得活下去，我還得活下去，我還得活下去！」他臉更紅了，咆哮着，憤怒着，彷彿身邊正潛伏着一種看不見的魔力會隨時隨地吞噬了他的生命：「我偏要活下去！我認出了這些魔鬼在那里幹着人吃人的勾當，在那里醞釀病菌！……大家起來喲，把牠們毀滅了，把牠們從世界的體骸上剜掉！」</p>
<p>燈光比先前明亮了起來。靜了一刻。</p>
<p>我又注視着那過度興奮後的靜睡着的臉孔，牠微微在冒着汗——那充分地發揮了他的痛快和滿足的汗。「哦，是的，他並沒有病。」</p>
<p>黑黯將落葉擲在窗櫺上，發出沙沙的呻吟。</p>
<p>呻吟後正閃爍着汗。</p>
<p>「哦，是的，世界是病着的，我們得把他身上的一切壞肉剜掉！」</p>

<h3>鷹與鷂</h3>

<p>我要殺你而吃你的肉。」『爲什麽你要殺我？』</p>
<p>『多蠢的東西！並且我看你消息也不靈通。我的窠太小了，所以我要你的窠；這樣我的兒子們便有發展的餘地了。再則，我有我的老鷹政策，你却在講另一種語言，你又不依從我的意思。』</p>
<p>『我講自然所賜給我的語言。你能否吿訢我爲什麽我要依從你的意思？』</p>
<p>『我不知道，不過我知道我有權殺死任何不依從我的意思的東西。』</p>
<p>『這樣說來，我是沒有倖免之望了罷？』『我看是沒有了。可是如果你準備犧牲自已，那對於你是一種極大的光榮。』</p>
<p>『請你吿訴我，我的朋友，你從那裏學得這種思想的方法的？』</p>
<p>『嘿，你這蠢扌，老鷹回答，『你豈不知道我在柏林動物國中硏究了兩年之久麽？』</p>

<h3>薩姆高爾溫　選舉十二大明星</h3>
<p>— 慕陶</p>
<p>製片巨頭薩姆高爾溫氏就只多年經驗選出十二明星，以爲他心目中所認爲最偉大的影星，並各加以簡略說明。其名次如下：</p>
<p>（一）却利卓別林　無疑地站在好萊塢名星的領袖地位，他是最偉大的喜劇家，並且不受時間淘汰，至今聲名不弱。他的表演在內心的多於機智方而，當我們看到他表演而笑的時候，眼淚常常跟着在後面。</p>

<h3>「西風劇社」與「西太后」</h3>
<p>歷史故事作爲戲劇的取材，在此時此地的環境裏，是更普遍了。有些投機性的戲團體，却在粗製濫造地演出，雖然這些「私訂終身後花園」的束與西，時代完全相背道而馳，但頗能使一輩小市民趨之若驚，然而究竟是一件取巧，投機的勾當，我們絕對不能寬宥他們。</p>
<p>大槪不致於遺忘吧，民國二十五年十一月間，「四十年代劇團」在上海，把夏衍先生的劇作「賽金花」，作榮譽演出的一回事吧！它的出演郤把羣醜像秋風吹落葉般，一掃而光，滬戰發生後的上海，劇運更較從前繁盛起來了；這並不是投機，確是適應時代需要；至少可以這樣說：「孤島不孤」！「四十年代」因了種種的關係結束了，這是多麽使人惋惜的一回事，可是後繼者也不在少數；最近，岳楓連絡了許多劇影界及敎育界的優秀份子，組織了一個「西風劇藝社」，準備在短時間內，公演「西太后」。</p>
<p>以「西太后」和「賽金花」來比較，當然覺得前者比後者更有演出的價値，因爲賽金花僅僅是淸末的一個名妓，艷名雖紅，可是，與歷史，與政冶的關係，究屬還淺，她不過在八國聯軍一役時，以正義和美色來勸服了聯軍統帥德人瓦德西，使平津一帶的民眾，少受一些兵燹之災：至於西太后呢，她簡直是否國四千年來一代女傑，可以和她抗衡的除掉武則天之外，可以說沒有第二個人，然而武氏執政時，吾國還是一個閉關自守的國家，一切事情當然還易於應付，可是在西太后治國的六十多年中，正是外侮內息，交相煎迫的當兒，她憑藉着獨賦的政治天才和超人一等的手腕，周旋折衝，听經過的艱苦，眞比賽金花困難上萬倍；在她畢生事業中，眞有許許多多的材料，可以供給我們來做參考，無論她是成功的或是失敗的。</p>
<p>「西風劇藝社」這後起之秀的劇團健兒，首次公演就採取了這樣」個故事。在將來演出時，當哄動一時。</p>
<p>我們在期待着。</p>

<h3>Thirteen Soviet Planes Bomb Finnish Capital, Many Fires Erupt, Army Attacks on Three Fronts, Finnish Resistance is Strong, Several Warships Shell Ports on North and South Coasts</h3>
<p>Helsinki: It is reported from here that the Soviet Union has delivered an ultimatum to Finland, stating that unless Finland accepts all of its demands today, the Soviet Union will destroy Finland. This morning, thirteen Soviet planes dropped bombs on the southern suburbs of Helsinki, but the people of Helsinki are very calm. Bombs dropped on the Helsinki airfield landed about 400 yards from the office, causing little damage. Civilians in the city are evacuating in a calm and orderly manner, without any sign of distress. Women gathered at designated locations and were transported by streetcars and cars. Parliament adjourned late last night after meeting until after midnight. A portion of the border has indeed been occupied by the Red Army. It is widely believed that the Soviet Union intends to land troops at several points on the coast. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: An alarm was issued in this city at 2:10 PM today. Half an hour later, seven Soviet planes appeared over the city, dropping dozens of incendiary bombs, causing many civilian casualties. A second wave of nine Soviet planes then arrived to bomb the city, causing many houses to be hit and burned, with many casualties. The number has not yet been determined. Military sources claim that a total of four Soviet planes were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, two near the city, one on Hanko Island, and another in the Karelian Isthmus. In addition, the port of Turku issued an air raid alert at 11:40 AM today. A group of Soviet planes then arrived to bomb the port, causing heavy damage. A hospital was also affected. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Ten Soviet bombers attacked Helsinki this afternoon, dropping incendiary bombs that caused a large fire. Many houses are still burning tonight. The bombers attacked in formations of two or three planes. One bomb fell near the main railway station, shattering windows in a large area. The Higher Industrial School also caught fire. About twenty bombs fell on the northern part of the city, one of which was very large, causing thick smoke when it hit the ground. Soviet planes encountered fierce anti-aircraft fire. It is reported that one Soviet plane was hit, caught fire, and crashed. The air raid alarm sounded again late tonight. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: As of midnight yesterday, Soviet bombers had attacked Helsinki three times, killing eighty people. Civilians have been evacuated from Helsinki. Trains and roads are crowded with refugees. Twenty houses in Helsinki have been burned. Rescue work continued until late at night. Last night, civilians spent the night in air raid shelters. All lights were turned off, except for the flames from the burning houses. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington: The State Department has just received a report that when Soviet planes bombed Helsinki yesterday, fifteen planes dropped bombs near the U.S. Embassy. Embassy staff have now evacuated to a hotel. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Red Army has crossed the border in the areas of Kirisillia and Kianasenke, and has occupied the island of Siskari, forty miles west of Kronstadt. The port of Terijoki, ten miles from the border, has been occupied by the Red Army after being shelled by warships. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Finnish port of Petsamo (located near the Soviet port of Murmansk) fell this morning after being shelled again by Soviet artillery. The cities of Kiganas and Salmijärvi were also bombed by Soviet planes today. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Stockholm: It is rumored here that Hanko Island, known as the "Gibraltar of the Baltic Sea," has fallen after being bombed by Soviet planes, but this has not been confirmed. It is reported that the Finns are bravely resisting land, sea, and air attacks in the Karelian Isthmus. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Soviet troops attacked on three fronts yesterday. The main front is in the Karelian Isthmus, which is where Finland has its most fortified defenses. The second front is north of Lake Ladoga, bypassing the Karelian Isthmus on both sides, targeting the cities of Imbilatti and Dadafala. The area is forested with thick snow. Finnish troops are putting up a strong resistance. The third front is at the northern end of the border between Finland and the Soviet Union. Soviet troops have occupied the Rybachy Peninsula, which is located on the coast of the Arctic Ocean, with a harsh climate, barren land, and poor communication. Only patrols and mobile units can operate there. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Finnish troops have left here today. Hanko Island has been bombed three times by Soviet planes. It is reported that Vyborg is burning. The town of Aspsö has been shelled by the Soviet fleet, with hundreds of shells fired. According to unofficial sources, Soviet troops have occupied Hogland Island and the Siskari Peninsula. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: It is reported here that Soviet warships sailed out from their bases yesterday and shelled the coast near Helsinki at 10:30 AM this morning. The sound of cannon fire can be heard in Helsinki. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<h3>Under Soviet Threat, Finnish Government Resigns, New Cabinet Formed Yesterday, Preparing to Negotiate a Ceasefire with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Copenhagen: According to sources here, the Soviet Union has delivered an ultimatum to Finland, demanding that Finland form a new government in order to begin negotiations. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Officials have just announced that the current Finnish government has informed the Soviet Union that it is willing to retreat. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The new Finnish government was formed at 4:00 PM today. Former Finance Minister Tanner has been appointed as Foreign Minister. Thus, one of the main demands of the Soviet Union has been met, and Soviet-Finnish negotiations may be able to continue. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Sources here believe that the President of the Bank of Finland, Ryti, will form a new government, with Paasikivi, the chief representative currently engaged in Soviet-Finnish negotiations in Moscow, as Minister of Foreign Affairs. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland: Regarding the meeting of the Finnish Parliament last night, news has just been received here that "the members of the parliament first gathered in the dark on the steps of the parliament, and then traveled by car to a secret location. The meeting began at 8:00 PM, and Prime Minister Sander and Foreign Minister Erkko, as well as Defense Minister Niukkanen, reported on the diplomatic and military situation. As a result of the parliamentary discussion, it was immediately decided to accept the mediation of the United States, and to express confidence in the Sander cabinet." According to the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" here, "After the Finnish Parliament passed the vote of confidence, the Sander cabinet suddenly resigned, which was quite unexpected. Nothing is yet known. The German reports that the new Finnish Prime Minister Tanner has been ordered to reopen negotiations with the Soviet government have also not been confirmed." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Finnish Foreign Minister's Daughter Injured in Bombing</h3>

<h3>Chamberlain Expresses Regret Over Soviet Actions</h3>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain responded to a question from Labour MP Attlee in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the Soviet attack on Finland, saying that the British government deeply regretted that a small, independent country had once again been attacked, causing suffering and loss of life to innocent people. There was no need to resort to force in the Soviet-Finnish issue, so the British government welcomed the mediation proposal made by U.S. Secretary of State Hull. The Soviet and Finnish sides had been exchanging views for some time regarding strategic issues raised by the Soviet Union concerning the proximity of the Finnish border to Leningrad. (Laughter from the audience.) The two places are about 200 miles apart, and the Soviet Union has proposed that Finland give up a portion of its border in exchange for land to the north. The Soviet Union also wants to acquire Finnish islands in the Finnish Gulf and Finnish ports at the mouth of the Gulf in order to consolidate the Soviet Union's position in the Gulf of Finland. It is reported that the Soviet Union has also demanded Finnish territory in the Patteri Peninsula that controls Petsamo, Finland's only Arctic Ocean port. The Finnish government has never adopted a provocative attitude from beginning to end. (Cheers from the audience.) However, it holds a determination not to yield and damage its sovereignty. Before diplomatic relations were broken, the note delivered by Finland to Moscow was worded extremely moderately. In this note, Finland proposed that the issue be submitted to arbitration and agreed to withdraw troops from the Finnish border in the Karelian Isthmus, leaving only ordinary border guards and tax officials. However, on Tuesday night, the Soviet Union unilaterally abrogated the Soviet-Finnish non-aggression treaty, which clearly stipulated that all disputes such as those that had occurred would be resolved peacefully. The British government is deeply concerned about this development. The British government finds it difficult to believe that the scope and importance of the military plans adopted by the Soviet Union are necessary to protect the Soviet Union from a small country like Finland. Last night, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov broadcast, denying that the Soviet Union intended to attack Finland, as reported by foreign newspapers. However, within a few hours, Soviet troops were reported to have invaded Finnish territory at several points on the border and dropped incendiary bombs on airfields near Helsinki. Shortly afterwards, Helsinki and Vyborg were bombed, causing some casualties. Attlee said that the Soviet attack on Finland seemed to be an act of unprovoked aggression, which was indefensible. He asked whether the British government had received any communication from the Soviet side explaining this action. Chamberlain replied that it had not. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London: Labour MP Dalton stated last night during a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons that the Labour Party had met and concluded that a strong country had committed an act of aggression against a small, democratic country in the Soviet-Finnish situation. The Labour Party was particularly dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's rejection of the U.S. mediation proposal. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Condemn</h3>
<p>Paris: French newspapers unanimously condemned the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, considering it another shameful act. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>Nordic Countries Sympathetic to Finland</h3>
<p>Oslo: Regarding the Soviet Union's attack on Finland, crowds gathered in front of the newspaper offices here last night to await news, and did not disperse until late at night. Many university students and young workers formed groups and sang the national anthems of Finland and Norway in front of the Finnish Embassy. Some of them planned to hold a demonstration in front of the Soviet Embassy, but were stopped by the police. Newspapers here expressed sympathy for Finland. All the windows of the Communist Party newspaper office were smashed by the crowd. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: More than one hundred Danish volunteers have automatically joined the Finnish Foreign Legion, willing to assist the Finnish army in combat. Finnish officials have not made any comment on this. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Swedish diplomatic officials told a correspondent of the Haitong News Agency last night that Sweden and Norway currently do not intend to assist Finland, because although both countries sympathize with Finland's plight, from a military point of view, neither country can fight against the Soviet Union. If Soviet military actions extend to other Scandinavian countries, then Sweden and Norway will resist with force. The Swedish King had previously stated this point at the Nordic Conference. If the Soviet Union attacks Sweden itself, then Sweden will participate in the Soviet-Finnish war. The general observation here is that the Soviet Union may be satisfied after meeting its demands on Finland, and will not take further action against Sweden and Norway. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: The entire Netherlands is indignant at the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland. Yesterday, when the news of the Soviet invasion was announced, the windows of a Dutch Communist Party office here were smashed by the crowd. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Attack on Finland Likely Difficult to Drive Straight Through, Finnish People Strong-Willed, Able to Defend from Strong Positions</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters military correspondent reports that although the Soviet army invading Finland is superior in numbers and quality to the defending army, the Red Army will find it difficult to drive straight through a country of lakes and dense forests defended by 600,000 knowledgeable patriots. Most of the Finnish reservists are veterans. The Finns are a strong and hard-working people, known for their athleticism. This physique, combined with industry and a determination to defend themselves, has earned them the admiration of the United States. The fact that Finland has not yet paid off all its war debts to the United States is insignificant compared to the Finns' character and values. One-third of the Finnish army is made up of women's units, similar to the British Women's Auxiliary Defence Corps. Dressed in gray uniforms, they are responsible for cooking and nursing. Although the Soviet Union has announced that it has no intention of occupying Finland, how will the Soviet Union be able to force this kind of physically and mentally sound nation to accept its wishes? Other commentators say that the main defense against aggression from the east is the "Mannerheim Line," Finland's "Maginot Line." Mannerheim is a famous Finnish general. The terrain of Finland helps engineers build a powerful line of defense. Forests that remain green in winter protect their barracks and training grounds, which cannot be seen from the sky. Some areas have lakes and dangerous swamps interspersed, which do not need to be fortified. The ground is covered with granite boulders, which serve as obstacles to defend against tanks. Some areas have cleverly placed electrified barbed wire. In addition, the Finns have dug wide trenches. The Finns have used the special advantages of their terrain to set up various gun positions and large fortifications. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Internal Transport and Export of Goods</h3>
<p>Since the ban on internal transport of products from occupied areas has been discussed, the question of whether the Shanghai concession should be included in the occupied area has arisen. The transport of goods from the interior to Shanghai has also sometimes been banned under the name of "aiding the enemy." Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life gather, and it is the hub of China and foreign countries, with a complex situation and a special environment. Therefore, its position is more subtle than the occupied areas surrounding the Shanghai concession, and it is also very different from the regions under the complete control of Free China. Therefore, when talking about Shanghai today, there is no need to ask what its position is, but instead to reflect on the origins of the ban on internal transport. Is it because the government is hindering the movement of industry and commerce, or is it a method of cracking down on those who are willing to be accomplices of the enemy? It is indeed the treacherous and greedy who forget their righteousness that have promoted this situation.</p>
<p>The economic situation in the occupied areas is bleak and declining. Only the daily necessities of life exist in industry and commerce. This is the result of the invaders' past burning, looting, and massacre, and also violates their original intention of exploiting and oppressing in order to support the war with war. Therefore, although they threaten and entice people to cooperate, in reality, those who love themselves are unwilling to cooperate with them, and local thugs cannot cooperate with them. When their ambitions are revealed, they again use the name of control to carry out the reality of seizing property, and all sources of profit are taken for themselves. Although the Chinese people knew about the scorched earth policy, they did not have time to implement it at that time, or could not bear to implement it, and those who did not have time to withdraw, the remaining means of production were mostly reused. They call their factories Chinese factories, and their goods Chinese goods, but the capital and resources are not. Even goods brought by sea are rebranded and called national factories and national goods to cater to the Chinese people's preferences. Those who are used and become their pawns appear to be Chinese businessmen. Compared with those who would rather be jade broken than tile complete, who, because their factories and land have fallen and their goods are exhausted, would rather change to other industries and be upright, cannot be counted. Just as the waters of the Jing and Wei rivers flow differently, and the odors of sweet herbs and wormwood are different, they cannot be mixed. If, because of sanctions, the loyal and good people cannot express their feelings, then it is because right and wrong are not clear, rewards and punishments are not fair, patriots are discouraged, and villains are triumphant, which is not the way to encourage good people. Therefore, strictly preventing disguised and deceptive commodities from entering the interior to fuel the fierce flames of economic aggression is a necessary measure from China's point of view. What should be paid attention to is that we must first conduct a thorough investigation and careful review. If there is no sign of counterfeiting or imitation, and there is reliable proof of everything, including the amount of production and sales, the actual situation of receipts and payments, and the source and destination, and there is no suspicion, and they can comply with the laws and regulations, they should still be allowed to flow into the interior. They should also be announced in the newspaper so that everyone can see and hear. If the name and reality do not match, someone will surely rise up to correct the wrong. In this way, the needs of the people in the interior will not be lacking, and mixed sales can also be eliminated.</p>
<p>As for the products exported from the interior, the main point is to prevent them from aiding the enemy, and in fact, it is for the sake of the livelihood and economy of the people in the interior, which is also to enrich the strength of the war of resistance. Therefore, products that can be exported and can be exchanged for wealth should not only not be prevented from flowing out, but should also be given assistance. As for what is called aiding the enemy, it should be limited to (1) those that can enrich their military use, and (2) those that can enrich their financial resources. In addition, all consumer goods for the people in the occupied areas are on the list of permissible exports. It is hoped that although the land is occupied temporarily by military force and has become an occupied area, the residents in the area, although temporarily losing their support, can still obtain living materials. This is better than drinking poison to quench thirst. The people in the interior are the backbone of the war of resistance, and the products of the interior are the resources of the war of resistance. We should cultivate them even more, and how can we bear to add any setbacks? Now, the major products of the interior are also on the list of unified control. Since it is called unified control, the power should be unified, and the laws and regulations should also be unified. If the power is not unified, there will inevitably be overlapping agencies, or there may be the responsibility to handle things, but not the power to handle them; or there may be the power to handle things, but it will open the door to competition. As a result, merchants are frustrated and goods are abandoned on the ground, which is not appropriate. If the laws and regulations are not unified, then right and wrong will be inconsistent, and it will be difficult to find a standard. The executors will suffer from the complexity and have nowhere to go, and the followers will suffer from hesitation and be punished at every turn, which is also not appropriate. All actions during wartime must be unified and agile. Sluggishness is really the medium of harm. Because China has a vast territory, the laws and regulations come from the central government, but the responsibility for their success lies with the local governments. Therefore, we must strive to streamline the administration, eliminate what is inconvenient for the people, and implement what is beneficial to the people. Only by maintaining internal and external ties and using them well can the country and the merchants achieve a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Appeals to Soviet Union and Finland Not to Bomb Unfortified Cities, Deeply Saddened by International Worship of Force, Ambassador to Soviet Union Mediates to Promote Negotiations</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt's telegram to the heads of state of Finland and the Soviet Union reads in part: "In recent years, hostilities have occurred in many parts of the world. Areas where ordinary people live have often been barbarously bombed by planes, and men, women, and children who are unable to defend themselves have been either bombed to death or crippled, numbering in the tens of thousands. This is deeply hated by civilized people. The conscience of all mankind has also been shaken by it. As these tragic wars are underway, if this barbaric method of warfare is adopted, then the number of innocent people who are harmed will be in the tens of thousands. Previously, I had issued an appeal to the governments of all countries engaged in large-scale warfare. Now, I am specifically following the previous example and requesting your government to publicly declare that it will not allow its troops to bomb ordinary people and unfortified cities under any circumstances. The only condition reserved is that the other side must do the same." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt formally stated today when meeting with reporters that the United States was deeply shocked by the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland. This move has endangered the right to self-governance of mankind. All nations should unanimously condemn this new means of using force to arbitrate international disputes. The policy of force is still spreading, and acts of barbarous disregard for the law are still taking place, which is distressing. The Finnish people and government have long had a record of complete peace and have earned the admiration and deep concern of the American people and government. When asked whether the United States' neutrality law could be implemented in the Soviet-Finnish conflict, President Roosevelt did not comment. When asked whether the U.S. government was considering withdrawing recognition of the Soviet Union, President Roosevelt also refused to answer. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The main task of the new cabinet is naturally the issue of reopening negotiations with the Soviet Union. Embassies in the Soviet Union are extremely active. Representatives of the U.S. Embassy and representatives of the Finnish government held several meetings in Moscow. It is reported that U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt warned Molotov that if the Soviet government refused to negotiate with the Finnish government, the United States would terminate Soviet-American trade and sever diplomatic relations. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington: After a meeting of the U.S. State Department, Secretary of State Hull accompanied Finnish Minister to the U.S. Procope to the White House to meet with President Roosevelt. The Finnish Minister and President Roosevelt had a long conversation. It is claimed that the Finnish Minister had a long-distance telephone conversation with the Finnish government before going to the White House to meet with the U.S. President, and there was some consultation. The U.S. government has not yet issued an official announcement of the U.S. President's meeting with the Finnish Minister. The Finnish Minister refused to comment to reporters after resigning, but solemnly stated that the Finnish government had not yet declared war, and only declared martial law in the country. However, the Finnish President has the special power to declare war when necessary. When reporters asked whether the Soviet actions could be regarded as military actions, the Finnish Minister replied, "I cannot say." (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington: Foreign observers here recently commented that American public opinion is more resentful of the Soviet Union than it was of Germany when Poland was invaded. The U.S. government, under the influence, may take diplomatic action in the near future. Former Republican President Hoover has given a speech in San Francisco, saying that the invasion of Finland is the reappearance of the old concepts and massacres of the Genghis Khan era. "Civilization has fallen to its lowest level. The day the Communist Party attacked Finland was also a tragic day for all intelligent and virtuous men and women in the world." On the other hand, the tone of the newspapers is also extremely angry. The Democratic "New York Times" stated that "the loser is not Finland, but the Russian Revolution. The remaining respect of the world for the Soviet government will be completely lost due to the wanton trampling of Finland." The Republican "New York Tribune" stated that "the American people are determined to maintain their peace within the scope permitted by safety. But they must also accept the truth. The evil forces promoted by Germany and the Soviet Union in the world have threatened the democratic Europe and also endangered the civilized world. Even if the United States wants to stay away from the war zone, it is morally obligated to the world and should condemn the crimes committed by the all-powerful countries against the defenseless and peaceful nations with a deep sense of disgust."

<h3>President Roosevelt Receives Finnish Envoy; Soviet Violent Aggression Unanimously Condemned by Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt, after returning to the capital from Warm Springs yesterday, immediately summoned Secretary of State Hull to discuss the situation in Finland. The discussion lasted a long time. Regarding the response after the American note was delivered to the Soviet government, nothing is yet known here. Political figures believe that Moscow will not reply in the short term. (1st, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>White House Convenes Meeting to Discuss Policy Towards the Soviet Union; Calls for Severing Relations with the Soviet Union Grow Louder; Situation in the Far East Must Also Be Considered</h3>
<p>Washington - According to news last night, President Roosevelt may convene leaders of both houses of Congress at the White House today to discuss American foreign policy. Policy towards the Soviet Union will be the focus of discussion. According to news from Congressional leaders last night, the United States will implement a retaliatory policy against the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland and sever relations with the Soviet Union. Government officials believe that the current situation in Finland is extremely serious. However, there is no official opinion expressed regarding the proposal by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman and other senators to review and study US-Soviet relations due to the dramatic changes in the European situation. Secretary of State Hull does not wish to express any opinion on the Soviet-Finnish dispute within 24 hours after the United States issued a note to the Soviet Union and Finland expressing its willingness to mediate. Utah Democratic Senator King publicly stated last night that the United States must immediately sever relations with the Soviet Union. He said, "The United States should no longer shake hands with Stalin's bloody hands. The Soviet Union is a barbaric, semi-civilized area ruled by thugs and those who destroy freedom and democracy." (1st, United Press)</p>
<p>Washington - All sectors of American society share deep indignation over the Soviet Union's attack on Finland. Members of Congress were greatly shocked to learn that Soviet aircraft had bombed many Finnish cities. Many members of Congress plan to introduce a bill when Congress reconvenes in January next year, advocating the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The reasons given are that the debt owed to the United States by the Russian Kerensky Provisional Government has not yet been resolved, and the businesses formerly operated by American citizens in Russia have been confiscated by the Soviet government without compensation. It is noted that when the United States and the Soviet Union re-established diplomatic relations in 1933, the United States originally intended to make the settlement of past debts a prerequisite, but later dropped the matter. It has not been resolved to this day, which can be used as a pretext. Republican Senator Vandenberg also issued a statement saying that the events in Poland and Finland have occurred one after another. For the sake of the United States, the only reasonable way is to prevent National Socialism and Communism from gaining a foothold in the country. In addition, the attitude of diplomatic circles is more moderate. It is said that the Far East issue has become acute due to the impending expiration of the US-Japan trade agreement. If the United States severs diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, it may make it easier for the Soviet Union and Japan to get closer, and the Far East issue will become more difficult to resolve. On the other hand, political figures say that if the United States' attitude towards Japan is too tough, it may cause the Soviet Union and Japan to sign a treaty similar to the German-Soviet agreement. The impact of this would be that Japan would be more active in excluding Western countries in China. The Soviet Union would also use the pretext of fighting against democratic countries and imperialism to assist Japan, which must also be guarded against. In summary, if the United States severs diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and imposes economic sanctions, it seems to be welcomed by public opinion. There is a high possibility that the American ambassador to the Soviet Union will be recalled. However, the impact of this move on the Far East issue will definitely be taken into account by the State Department. (1st, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Will American Neutrality Law Apply to the Soviet Union and Finland? Announcement Expected Soon</h3>
<p>Washington - The American "Dow Jones News Service" stated that there is a possibility that the United States will apply the provisions of the Neutrality Law to both the Soviet Union and Finland. When Secretary of State Hull was asked about this, Hull did not express his opinion, but said that he would announce it later and would not immediately explain the reasons for the American decision.

<h3>Finnish Foreign Minister Broadcasts to the United States</h3>
<p>Helsinki - Foreign Minister Erkko delivered a broadcast speech to the American people yesterday, saying, "There is a great power that has always maintained good neighborly relations with our country and has signed a non-aggression treaty with us. Now it is sending troops to attack our border positions and attacking our undefended cities and hospitals, and carrying out military actions against our country. The government of that country has repeatedly acknowledged that it does not need to worry about us, and we have never threatened it, and have tried our best to ensure the security of the city of Leningrad, which can be clearly demonstrated by our suggestion to withdraw border troops to a considerable distance. Subsequently, we proposed that a third country act as mediator. Although all of this has been rejected, we have exhausted all means to avoid conflict and can declare our innocence to the world. The great American nation has done much for the small democratic country of Finland, and we are extremely grateful. Now we turn to you to express our respect." (1st, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Telephone Communication Between American and Finnish Capitals Interrupted</h3>
<p>Washington - Telephone communication between here and the Finnish capital was reportedly interrupted this morning at 7:00 AM (Central Time) due to air raid alarms and bomb explosions. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Berlin's Attitude Undecided; Growing Anxiety About the Expansion of Soviet Power</h3>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the question raised by foreign journalists about what stance Germany will take on the Soviet-Finnish dispute, the responsible party here replied yesterday that no reliable news from Finland has reached here. The news received from Finland, the Nordic countries, and Britain is one-sided and does not clarify the whole truth. Therefore, German officials must wait until they receive news from Moscow before they can determine their attitude. (1st, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - The "Electrical News" here received a Berlin telegram last night that had been approved by censors, stating that all sectors of German society expressed sympathy for the Finns and felt deeply anxious about the expansion of Soviet power in the Baltic Sea. The concessions that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had to give to Moscow in exchange for Soviet assistance are now gradually being revealed. Germany has sacrificed the Baltic countries, and the Soviet Union has further demanded actions in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Germany is unable to back down from this. The expansion of Soviet power is extremely dissatisfying to the German army and navy. The army has not forgotten the days when Germans and Finns fought side by side to restrain Russia and restore Finland's independence, and the navy is also anxious due to strategic reasons.

<h3>Soviet War Report</h3>
<p>Moscow - At 2:00 AM on November 30, a Finnish troop crossed the Soviet border from the direction of Mansila Village and attacked the Red Army outpost in Kovkina Village on the north bank of Lake Ladoga. They were driven back into Finnish territory by the Soviets and suffered considerable losses. At 3:15 AM on the same night, someone fired machine guns at the Karelian Isthmus from the direction of Lasuri Village. Subsequently, a large Finnish infantry unit attacked Kokimaki Village. The result was also that they were repelled by the Soviet border guards. The Soviet army captured ten soldiers and one officer. At 4:00 AM on the same night, a Finnish infantry company attempted to attack the Soviet outpost in Temolovo Village in the Karelian Isthmus and was repelled by machine guns and rifles. The Soviet troops in the Leningrad Military District, in accordance with the order of the Red Army Headquarters, due to the continued armed provocations by the Finnish warlords, moved out at 8:00 AM on the 30th and crossed the border into Finland in the Karelian Isthmus and several other places. In the directions of Lipola and Polosuzlu, Red Army units have crossed the border and advanced 10 to 15 kilometers to the west. The Red Army attacking from Petrozavodsk has reached Lake Suchavi. In the Karelian Isthmus, the Red Army occupied the village of Metsapiiti and the Gokala Station and advanced towards the town of Terijoki. Soviet troops have captured many Finnish soldiers during their operations. The Soviet Air Force has conducted reconnaissance flights in adverse weather conditions and bombed airfields in Vyborg and Helsinki. (1st, TASS)</p>
<h3>Finnish War Report</h3>
<p>Helsinki - The General Headquarters has just released its first war report, stating that Soviet troops crossed the border without following the proper declaration of war procedures and attacked our country in many places. They were all repelled. However, our army did not take the opportunity to attack Soviet territory. Our army also destroyed two Soviet tanks on Lake Ladoga. The capital city was bombed by Soviet aircraft several times today. Civilians were killed and injured, especially women and children. After the city of Tashi was bombed, four people died and thirteen were injured. Hango Island was also bombed, killing one person and injuring several others. In addition, the Soviet fleet bombarded our country's coastline. Nine residents of Vyborg Port died. The Cabinet held a secret meeting today to discuss the situation. (30th, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>All Sectors of Chongqing Express Concern</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Today, all Chinese newspapers here published the news of the Soviet invasion of Finland in large print. However, officials did not criticize the recent developments in Soviet-Finnish relations. The news of Soviet troops crossing into Finland only reached Chongqing late last night. Although it caused surprise and much discussion among the general public, the Chinese do not regard the Soviet invasion of Finland as unexpected. This is because people here believe that the tone of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on November 29 already foreshadowed that the Soviet Union would take more active action. Although the Soviet-Finnish dispute has no direct relationship with China, the Chinese are quite concerned about the progress of this matter. Because China itself has suffered aggression, it expresses deep sympathy for Finland, which is fighting for freedom and independence. However, due to the current relationship of Soviet assistance to China's war of resistance, this sympathy cannot be expressed publicly. Since the European situation became increasingly tense, China has hoped that Britain and the Soviet Union would have close cooperation on international affairs. This hope has vanished with the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, the Soviet invasion of Poland, and the recent declaration by the Soviet Union officially denouncing Britain. China is currently eager to maintain relations with both Britain and the Soviet Union in order to obtain their assistance, so its position is extremely delicate. (2nd, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Adopt Parallel Policies in the Far East; Do Not Believe That Japan and the Soviet Union Can Form an Important Agreement; Some British Politicians Advocate Compromise with Japan</h3>
<p>London - Officials here strongly deny the unofficial threats made by Japan that it would seize British ships in retaliation for Britain's ban on the export of German goods. Britain's attitude is to adopt a parallel policy with the United States in the Far East. It is believed here that Japan will not conclude any important agreement with the Soviet Union. However, some British politicians advocate reaching an understanding with Japan as soon as possible to ensure that Japan maintains a cautious neutrality during the European war.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Lanzhou; One Aircraft Shot Down by Chinese; Bombs Dropped in the Suburbs of Lanzhou; Chinese Air Force Bravely Intercepts</h3>
<p>Lanzhou - Fifty-one Japanese aircraft, flying from Shanxi via Shaanxi to Gansu at around 8:00 AM on the 1st, arrived in Qingyang County. They were divided into two groups.

<h3>Dong Xuchu Issues Letter to All People of Guangxi Province; As Long as the Military and Civilians Work Together, It Will Not Be Difficult to Annihilate the Japanese If They Advance Deeply</h3>
<p>Guilin - Chairman Huang Xuchu issued a letter to the people of the province on the 30th, stating that the Japanese people, in order to complete their continental dream, did not expect that after two years of war, our entire country, from top to bottom, adhering to the Central Government's consistent national policy, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, would unite sincerely and resist unanimously. Our country is getting stronger and stronger as it fights, and the Japanese people's plans are failing. Recently, since the collapse of northern Hunan, in order to save the situation, they have attempted to deceive the international community and their domestic people and have had to make a desperate move by landing on the Qinzhou Fangcheng coast. Now their vanguard has approached Yongyi. Our province has always been known for its loyalty, and its customs are extremely brave. The grassroots organization of the militia has been praised by the whole country. Now that the Japanese people have invaded our homeland, if we do not give them a major blow, wouldn't it only make Chinese and foreigners disappointed in us? It is truly a disgrace to the people of Guangxi. We must teach our sons, warn our brothers, and respect our husbands, and work together to implement espionage reports, transportation, propaganda, and sabotage of Japanese telecommunications, roads, transportation lines, and disrupt the Japanese rear. Security, so that they are overwhelmed and unable to defend against everything. In all cities, towns, and villages, before the Japanese arrive, evacuate in advance, leaving nothing and no one to be used by the Japanese. We must do our best to rescue our wounded soldiers. All of this work should be done by our people. It must be known that the Japanese people have fought to this day and are already outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and there is nothing to fear. In the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Henan, etc., what we have lost are only cities and transportation strongholds. Even a village or a county cannot be completely controlled by the Japanese and still belongs to us. Such facts are seen and known by all Chinese people. Moreover, most of our province is mountainous, and the mechanical weapons that the Japanese rely on are inconvenient to use. As long as our people work sincerely and cooperate with the military, it will not be difficult to gather and annihilate the Japanese if they advance deeply. However, all of this is due to the bravery of the army, and at the same time depends on the efforts of the people. The victory in northern Hunan was achieved with the help of the people. It can be used as a clear sign. The current situation is related to the survival of the country and the nation. If we are temporarily at peace, we will suffer endless disasters for our children and grandchildren. Being able to endure temporary pain will surely give us the power to win the final victory. We hope that we will work together with one heart and one mind to go to the emergency, so that the military, politics, and villagers are closely related, united as one, and embrace the determination to sacrifice ourselves, and develop great fearlessness and loyalty to defend our homeland. Xuchu has a responsibility to defend the land and swears to dedicate himself to the party and the country. No matter how difficult it is, he will not hesitate to do so. He is willing to work together with all the fathers, brothers, sisters, and sisters in our province. (30th Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Smedley States China Will Certainly Win the War of Resistance; Japanese Troops Absolutely Incapable of Controlling Occupied Areas; Chinese People Have Overcome Various Difficulties</h3>
<p>Laohekou - A reporter today visited Miss Agnes Smedley, the American female writer who arrived here from Anhui and Henan. Miss Smedley, dressed in military uniform, traveled thousands of miles. Her hard work, perseverance, and passion for China's War of Resistance were fully revealed in her travel-worn appearance. Miss Smedley, in her candid and earnest manner, made the following remarks to the reporter: Recently, I read the Shanghai correspondence of Mr. Aben in the New York Times, which stated that Japan had at least controlled half of China. At the same time, I also saw a map of the Japanese-occupied territories in China. This map, like Mr. Aben's article, is equally false. When I arrived in these areas, on the entire battlefield, apart from the Japanese troops having machine guns and artillery, there was fundamentally no talk of occupation. The areas that the Japanese troops occupy are only certain cities along the Yangtze River and the Jinpu or Huning Railway. Moreover, the Japanese troops in these occupied cities, such as Hefei in Anhui, are like prisoners awaiting execution, daring not venture out. Even in Anqing, which is heavily guarded by the Japanese troops, the Japanese are not safe because Chinese regular troops and guerrillas constantly sneak in and attack their camps. Apart from these few cities and transportation lines, most of the land is under the control of the National Government. I traveled thousands of miles from southern Anhui to northern Anhui, then to Henan, and finally to northern Hunan. Everywhere I went was the rear of the Japanese army, and the only Japanese I saw were prisoners being transported from the front lines. Farmers in most of this region are farming as usual, and schools are more well-equipped than before the war. Specially trained youth in Anhui are implementing the baojia system in various counties. Therefore, in small villages in Anhui, one can often see trained young men and women serving as village leaders. At the same time, they are also instructors for local self-defense and political work groups, as well as schools. I also visited training schools for thousands of security zone cadres and trained youth who graduated from middle school and are engaged in political work in local guerrilla units. I can absolutely testify that the various points occupied by the Japanese troops are constantly being intercepted, and their front lines are fundamentally unstable. The Japanese troops are also unable to control the Yangtze River. Only a few troops occupy large cities along the river. Japanese ships can pass up and down, but they are often sunk by Chinese troops. The Japanese claim that they have already controlled the Yangtze River is merely self-deception. However, the health and medical relief of the ordinary people are particularly important issues. My general impression is that China has made considerable progress in politics and military affairs, but progress in industry and medicine is relatively slow. Although China has these unresolved problems, the final victory will ultimately belong to China because China will certainly overcome these difficulties. Before the Japanese troops can conquer China and occupy half of China, the Chinese people have a profound and universal spirit of resistance because the Chinese people all know that the policies implemented by the Japanese are aimed at destroying China and the nation. The political conspiracy of Japan and its puppets to enslave China today cannot deceive the eyes and ears of people at home and abroad. (29th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Butler Reports in the House of Commons on Britain's Wartime Diplomacy; Efforts to Maintain Good Relations with Neutral Countries; Britain and France Cooperate Fully and Cannot Be Separated by Germany</h3>
<p>London - Dalton of the Labour Party spoke in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that the preservation of European civilization depends on close and continued cooperation between Britain and France. I am not exaggerating when I say this. (Cheers from the crowd) The establishment of closer economic cooperation between Britain and France than ever before is most welcome. I still hope that this will be the starting point for a larger-scale plan that other countries can participate in. The British government should now consult with France and the Dominions to consider the nature of the Allied powers' peace objectives as soon as possible so that when the war ends earlier than expected, they will not be unprepared for the construction of a lasting peace. Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement on Wednesday that the future peace should not be based on conditions of retaliation is commendable. We should make the German people understand that after the end of the war, we want to see a free and civilized Germany occupying a position in a free and civilized Europe with the qualifications of a good and equal neighbor. There is a growing movement within Germany that could bring the Nazi regime and its bloody tools, namely the secret police, to an end sooner than we expect. (1st Reuter's dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Passes Full Powers Bill; Extended Until End of War</h3>
<p>Paris - After reconvening today, Premier Daladier immediately introduced the Wartime Full Powers Bill, requesting that the full powers enjoyed by the government (which expired today) be extended until the end of the war. After the bill was reviewed and passed by the Military Committee, the Finance Committee proposed a counter-proposal, arguing that all administrative decrees issued by the government should be submitted to Parliament for ratification within one month. This was opposed by Premier Daladier, who slightly amended the original bill as follows: "If the government issues various administrative decrees during Parliament's session, it should submit them to Parliament for ratification within one month; otherwise, it should submit them for ratification after Parliament reconvenes." The Chamber of Deputies then rejected the Finance Committee's counter-proposal by a vote of 309 to 189 and passed the government's proposal. From then on, the government can enjoy full powers during the war and use administrative decrees to take all important decisions regarding all operational matters. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Kangding - Since the establishment of the Xikang Provincial Government, Chairman Liu Wenhui has worked with the Department of Education to plan and implement education with great effort. However, in the remote mountainous areas of Ning District and in the counties formerly under the jurisdiction of Kang District, due to the special local circumstances, the curriculum, teaching materials, teacher salaries, and equipment have not yet reached perfection. Recently, Chairman Liu received instructions from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, urging him to actively plan and promote the expansion of various educational programs and to increase the budget. However, in the Kang District, there is a language barrier and deep-rooted Buddhism. In the Ning District, the tribes live far apart and are naturally fierce. To achieve universal education, it is necessary to first change their orientation and establish good customs. A plan to improve education for border residents has now been drafted, along with the budget for the 29th year of the Republic (1940), with total educational expenses for the year estimated at over 3 million yuan. It is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Military Affairs Commission for approval. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Occupy Advantageous Position on Northern Hubei Battlefield; Impressions of a Central News Agency Reporter's Inspection of the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Nanyang - The reporter traveled through the Dabie Mountains to Jun County, the northernmost front line in Hubei, and then to various places near the Tongbai Mountains, covering a distance of hundreds of miles and spending half a month. I only returned here from the Tongbai Mountains yesterday. The observations I gained can be summarized as follows: (1) The strategic importance of the Dabie and Tongbai Mountains is indeed two strong fortresses on the Henan-Hubei battlefield, and the strong morale of the soldiers and the people is undoubtedly an unshakable Great Wall. Both mountains are rich in resources. In an agricultural society, they can be economically self-sufficient. Farmers, workers, and merchants are all working hard in production, and the order is exceptionally stable. Bandits have now disappeared. The organization of the masses is widespread. Military and civilians cooperate like family members, helping each other, and supporting each other in times of illness. Their strength is growing daily, and there is nothing to worry about any eventuality. (2) The places the reporter passed through have been ravaged by the enemy in the past. Although it has been several months, the scars are still visible everywhere. Not only are there broken walls and rubble everywhere, but even pigs, sheep, chickens, and dogs are rare. Less than 10% of the houses remain, and most of the residents are still operating under thatched sheds, and the condition of the refugees is extremely pitiful. However, their determination to resist the enemy is extremely firm. Under the relief of the local authorities, they are all able to make a living, either as small traders or as laborers assisting the army. The results are very good. (3) The Japanese troops on the northern Hubei front line are threatened by the Chinese army everywhere. They are now relying solely on fortifications, trapped in their strongholds, fearing Chinese attacks, and firing blindly from time to time. The Chinese troops are a hundred times more courageous, one against ten. The cowardly Japanese troops flee at the sight of Chinese bayonets raised high. The Chinese troops are becoming more and more courageous, and the Japanese combat power is becoming weaker and weaker. There is irrefutable evidence everywhere. (4) Looking at the current situation on the northern Hubei battlefield, the Chinese army is indeed in an advantageous position, and the Japanese are in a disadvantageous position. In the future, they can only be passively defending, concentrating all their efforts to protect their rear transportation and prevent Chinese attacks. (30th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invading Yongning Will Be Surrounded and Annihilated by Chinese Troops; Following the Japanese Troops' Crossing of the Shiwan Mountains, the Tragedy of Northern Hunan Is Set to Repeat</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese troops invading southern Guangdong, after landing at Longmen and Qisha, continued to capture Qin County and Fangcheng, and launched a large-scale invasion of Guangxi Province. Their objective is Yongning, which is purely a military operation, completely different from the purely economic operation of occupying Chaozhou and Shantou. At the beginning of the Japanese landing, a spokesman for the Japanese military headquarters falsely claimed that it was to strengthen the blockade of the South China coast, with the intention of diverting Chinese attention to benefit their attack. This is evident from the direction of their actions, with the main force attacking Qin County and Fangcheng instead of Beihai. Qin County is closer to Yongning and has the Qin-Yong Highway connecting them. Currently, the Japanese aggression is aimed at saving every ounce of strength. If they forcefully occupy Beihai, it would have little military value and would require dispersing their forces, giving the Chinese an opportunity to exploit. According to intelligence, the number of Japanese troops landing at Qin and Fang has been increasing, reaching over 10,000. However, the Shiwan Mountains stretch for over a thousand miles between Guangdong and Guangxi, and the terrain is treacherous. The Chinese army has already deployed defenses in all the strategic locations. In the future, after the Japanese troops penetrate deep, they will be surrounded and subjected to fierce attacks from all sides, causing the tragedy of the Japanese defeat in northern Hunan to be re-enacted between Guangdong and Guangxi. The following is a record of the war news received:</p>
<p>The Fall of Fangcheng and Qinzhou</p>
<p>On the 15th, under the cover of intense fire from warships, the Japanese troops gained a foothold at Qisha and Longdou. By evening, their numbers had continued to increase. On the morning of the 16th, over 2,000 people had gathered at Qisha, and 2,000 to 3,000 at Longmen. With the assistance of multiple aircraft, they launched an offensive into the interior. Troops from certain divisions of the Chinese army, in coordination with local militias, fought bravely. The fighting was very fierce. By noon, the Japanese troops had suffered hundreds of casualties. They became enraged and fully utilized the advantage of their mechanized infantry to intensify the pressure on the Chinese army. The Chinese army also persevered and worked closely with the civilian self-defense teams, holding their positions. At about 3 p.m., a unit of the Japanese army desperately broke through to the outskirts of Fangcheng. At the same time, over ten Japanese aircraft took turns bombing the city, destroying all the large buildings in the city and causing fires to break out everywhere, with many civilians killed and everything turned to ashes. At this time, the Japanese reinforcements poured in like a tide. Since the county town had been turned into ruins with no value to defend, the Chinese army transferred to a more advantageous area to continue the war. After the Japanese army entered the city, they committed all kinds of atrocities. However, most of the civilians had been evacuated in advance, and all supplies had been destroyed. As for Qin County, on the afternoon of the same day, over a hundred Japanese cavalrymen charged into the city, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Chinese army. They were surrounded by the Chinese army and, without reinforcements, were completely annihilated by the Chinese army. The situation became more stable. In the evening, the Japanese army, not daring to launch a large-scale offensive due to the unfavorable terrain, only shelled the city with artillery throughout the night. At dawn on the 17th, the Japanese army made a large-scale movement, with over 2,000 cavalry, artillery, and infantry launching a fierce attack on the county town in three routes. Multiple Japanese aircraft went even more insane in their attacks. The Chinese troops and civilians resisted at every stage. However, due to the vast disparity in numbers, they retreated to a certain area. After the county town fell into the hands of the Japanese army, the burning and killing were extremely brutal. By noon, the Japanese army stationed a small number of troops in the suburbs and the rest advanced north along the Qin-Yong Highway.</p>
<p>Vietnam on Alert to Defend Against Japanese Troops</p>
<p>Vietnam borders Fangcheng. Dongxing, a district of Fangcheng, and Mangjie, a district of Vietnam, are separated by only a bridge. Previously, the Vietnamese government, in order to strengthen its defense in response to the outbreak of the European War, had imposed strict security measures at the Sino-French border and restricted the entry of people. Later, as the European situation entered a stalemate, it announced the lifting of martial law. Now, the French government, due to the sudden invasion of Fangcheng by the Japanese army, the serious situation, and the fact that the Japanese army is unreasonable and disregards international law, making it difficult to guarantee that they will not cause trouble, has re-imposed emergency security measures on the Sino-French border. Large numbers of French soldiers and Annamite troops are actively deploying defenses in the Mangjie area, building massive sandbag fortifications and maintaining strict vigilance. The inspection of passing pedestrians is extremely serious. A large number of refugees have fled into Mangjie. However, since the relations between China and France have always been friendly, they have not been hindered.</p>
<p>The Port of Beihai Has Not Yet Fallen</p>
<p>As of recently, Beihai is still in Chinese hands. Along the coast of Guantouling, Dijiao, and Nanhuan, six or seven Japanese warships are often gathered. Since attempting to land once on the morning of the 15th, they have not attacked again. They only frequently fire artillery at the coast to create a diversion. The Chinese defenders have doubled their guard. Deng Shizeng, the administrative commissioner and security commander of the Eighth District, is stationed in a certain area, mobilizing the people to participate in the war of resistance. The residents of Beihai have been forcibly evacuated. All military structures have also been prepared for destruction if necessary. There are over twenty foreign nationals from Britain, France, the United States, and Germany in Beihai. Under the orders of the local authorities, they have all evacuated. Only one American missionary remains in the city. The German nationals have all transferred to Guangxi Province due to the European War. The remaining foreign nationals have taken the route through Lianjiang and Suixi, passing through Guangzhou Bay to Hong Kong. Goods exported from Guangxi and southern Guangdong were originally exported through Beihai and Guangzhou Bay. Now, due to the outbreak of war in the Beihai area, it is impossible to navigate, so everything is concentrated for export through Guangzhou Bay. A large number of refugees are also fleeing into Guangzhou Bay, making it very crowded.</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices in Sichuan Province: The Plight of the Poor Intensifies, Driven by Speculation in Oil and Rice</h3>
<p>Chengdu Dispatch: Since late October, commodity prices in Sichuan Province, excluding remote counties, have surged dramatically. The situation is particularly dire in Chongqing, Chengdu, and the counties along the Chengdu-Chongqing highway. Among the goods, daily necessities such as oil, rice, firewood, charcoal, and pork have seen the most significant price increases. This situation has become a pressing issue, causing widespread hardship among the poor. Even primary school teachers, with their meager salaries, are feeling the pinch. The primary reason for the soaring prices is the sudden increase in the prices of rapeseed oil and rice. The increase in rapeseed oil prices is mainly attributed to unscrupulous merchants manipulating rapeseed supplies through hoarding and speculation. Increased demand is only one factor. The main market for oil and rice in western Sichuan is Xindu. To suppress oil and rice prices, the Sichuan Provincial Government has dispatched officials to Xindu to investigate the amount of rapeseed and oil stored in warehouses, register and manage them, strictly prohibit speculative trading, and prevent manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. The Department of Civil Affairs will also convene representatives from the government and business sectors of Chengdu, Xindu, Huayang, and the three counties, as well as oil and rice merchants in Chengdu, to discuss fundamental solutions. In Chengdu, the municipal government has been managing the North and South Rice Markets since the 17th. For rapeseed and rapeseed oil transactions, buyers, sellers, brokers, and whether the buyer is an oil merchant and the purpose of purchasing rapeseed is for oil extraction must be declared in detail by all three parties. At the same time, the municipal government dispatches personnel to conduct secret investigations to prevent manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. The Municipal Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting at the municipal government on the 18th, and representatives from the Oil, Rice, and Money Trade Associations also attended to jointly discuss ways to stabilize oil and rice prices, thereby regulating overall commodity prices.</p>
<h3>North Jiangsu Chinese Army Attacks Jingjiang as Japanese and Puppet Troops Collapse</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: Han Deqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu, recently appointed He Keqian as Commander-in-Chief of the ×× War Zone. He led the ×× Battalion to advance towards Rugao County, defeating the Japanese army in Chaiwan. The fighting is now progressing to Rugao County, and has been fierce in recent days. At the same time, cadres from the ×× Regiment stormed into Jijiashi and Tangjiazha, also engaging in street fighting. Although the Japanese army in Jijiashi had built strong fortifications, they gradually retreated eastward after being attacked by the Chinese army. Jijiashi and Tangjiazha were subsequently recovered by the Chinese army. At Gushan Town in Jingjiang County, a joint Japanese-puppet force of 60-70 men was surrounded by the ×× Battalion of the Chinese army on the Gushan mountaintop fortress. The Chinese army from Jijiashi and Tangjiazha also advanced rapidly towards Jingjiang County along small paths and are currently joining the attack.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Improves Social Education Plan (2) Promoting Broadcasting and Film Education; Editing and Reviewing Popular Reading Materials</h3>
<p>(C) Promoting Electrified Education with Film and Broadcasting: Film and broadcasting are powerful tools for implementing social education, capable of covering the largest space in the shortest time and exerting the greatest force with the least amount of material. Since the autumn of the 25th year, the Ministry of Education has been actively promoting these tools, and significant progress has been made in the past two years. However, given the vast territory of our country and the uneven distribution of facilities, continued efforts are urgently needed in the future to complete the broadcasting education network as soon as possible. The installation of radios should be increased so that every township or joint security group has radio equipment to listen to educational broadcasts on time. In addition, the number of mobile film education service zones should be increased annually so that every county and city has a set of film education equipment to conduct mobile teaching in the villages and towns within its jurisdiction. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Measures to Complete the Broadcasting Education Network: A. The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should complete the organization of the Broadcasting Education Service Office within their own departments and bureaus and comprehensively plan the promotion of broadcasting education. B. Each province and city should divide the entire province or city into several broadcasting education guidance zones based on administrative inspectorates or the guidance area of the provincial public education hall, establish a Broadcasting Education Service Office in each zone, and appoint a full-time broadcasting instructor under the guidance of the broadcasting education service office of the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus to handle the supervision of broadcasting education, guidance and consultation on radio technology, and the repair and inspection of radio equipment.</p>
<p>C. If each province has already established a public education hall in each administrative inspectorate commissioner's area, the affairs of the broadcasting education guidance zone can be managed by the provincial public education hall.</p>
<p>D. At the central level, the Ministry of Education will contact the Central Broadcasting Administration and the Central Propaganda Department, as well as the relevant departments of the Ministry of Communications, to jointly formulate a plan for adding radios in counties and cities in the rear area, and assist local governments in installing radios.</p>
<p>E. Schools at all levels, public education halls, and larger public schools in each county and city should make every effort to install radios and make full use of them so that nearby people can directly or indirectly receive broadcasting education.</p>
<p>F. Other educational institutions and local autonomous organizations and public groups should also do their best to install radios and establish contact with other radio institutions to jointly promote broadcasting education.</p>
<p>G. To supply power to the radios, each province should establish small-scale dry battery manufacturing plants. H. If provinces, counties, and cities utilize holidays to conduct training classes for social education personnel and primary and secondary school teachers, "Management and Use of Radios" should be included as a compulsory course.</p>
<p>G. Each province, county, and city should include broadcasting education expenses in the social education budget. H. Omitted.</p>
<p>(2) Measures to Expand Film Education: A. Each provincial and municipal education department and bureau should establish a film education service office to comprehensively plan the promotion of film education in the province. If funding and personnel are insufficient, the broadcasting education service office and the film education service office can be merged to establish an Electrified Education Service Office.</p>
<p>B. Within the 28th year, each province should establish a mobile film education service zone in each administrative inspectorate area. The office (or communication office) of the zone should be located in the office of the administrative inspectorate commissioner of the area, and the counties directly under the area should be the scope of mobile teaching. Subsequently, the teaching area should be gradually reduced each year, and the number of teaching areas should be increased, with the goal of completing the desire to establish a film education teaching area in each county within a year.</p>
<p>C. If each province has already established a provincial public education hall in each administrative inspectorate commissioner's area, the affairs of the mobile film education service zone can be managed by the provincial public education hall.</p>
<p>D. Each mobile teaching zone should be equipped with a generator and a projector. The equipment will be fully or partially subsidized by the Ministry for provinces to receive. Starting from the 28th year, for provinces receiving half subsidy, an additional equipment fee of 800 yuan should be raised for each additional teaching zone established. Each province should add a slide projector and a sound machine to each established teaching zone from the 28th year onwards. E. The educational films shown in each provincial film education mobile teaching zone will still be supplied by the Ministry on a regular basis as a principle. Starting from the 28th year, each province should establish its own educational film library to purchase and produce films related to history, geography, customs, and specialized industrial and agricultural education to enhance national consciousness.</p>
<p>F. Each province should include the recurring expenses of the film education mobile teaching zone in the social education budget.</p>
<p>G. The Ministry's Electrified Education Personnel Training Class has film education and broadcasting education groups, whose main goal is to train film and broadcasting education technicians for each province. The Ministry will continue to hold these classes every year, and each province should send a corresponding number of candidates according to the number of film teaching zones and broadcasting education guidance zones added, so as to avoid the feeling of a lack of talent when additional zones are established.</p>

<h3>Western League First Division Football Match: Eastern China vs. Eastern Sele Today, 2:30 PM at the Recreation Ground, Luo Douwen to Replace Ade at Center Forward</h3>
<p>The Western League First Division football match between Eastern and Eastern Sele will be held at the Recreation Ground at 2:30 PM today. Referee Shen Huichun.

<h3>The Puppet Municipal Government Forcibly Collecting Donations from Residents on Yuyuan Road; Dares Not Collect from Foreigners; The Exact Amount of Donations Collected is Not Announced</h3>
<p>According to the "Zi Lin Bao", donation collectors from the "Shanghai Municipal Government Finance Bureau" began collecting "house donations" on Yuyuan Road in the outer road area yesterday (30th). According to the "Bureau" officials yesterday morning, the donation collection was not difficult, and there were quite a few residents who paid donations. However, the exact amount of donations collected was not announced. The "Municipal Government" now believes that the outer road area is under its management, but it will not collect house donations from foreign residents, shop owners, and managers in the area, as negotiations on this issue are still pending. "Finance Bureau" collectors, accompanied by municipal police, have gone to the Yuyuan Road area to collect donations, and those who refuse to pay donations will be detained. The amount of donations is calculated based on the rent rate, with shops at 11% and residents at 9%, according to the announcement. Donation collectors have been collecting donations in other outer roads for more than a day, but only went to Yuyuan Road yesterday. Many foreigners reside on the road, but no collectors have collected "winter house donations" from them. According to Jiangwan "officials", the collection of house donations was announced many weeks ago, but it was delayed. Then it was announced that foreigners were also included in the donation list. Although negotiations on the outer roads issue are still ongoing, the "Municipal Government" has actually begun collecting donations for the first time. According to the "New Shen Bao", since the establishment of the "West District Collection Office" in March of last year, the work of collecting "house donations" has been proceeding smoothly, but residents living in the outer road area and relying on the protection of the Shanghai Municipal Council have refused to pay, which is a violation of the law. Although one or two residents have voluntarily paid, the number is very small. "Director" Zhou was not satisfied and ordered the West District Office to begin collecting in the outer road area of ​​western Shanghai as well.</p>
<h3>Japanese Detaining Chinese Police Intended to Intimidate</h3>
<p>Two Chinese police officers "tried" in a puppet court: Two Chinese police officers from the Public Concession were performing their duties on Robert Road on the 19th of last month when they had a conflict with a puppet member and were detained by the Japanese military police. Although Major Bowen, Chief Inspector of the Police, made a serious protest to the Japanese, they have not been released. Foreign sources believe that the Japanese are detaining the two Chinese police officers to intimidate other Chinese police officers performing their duties. After the Chinese police officers were detained, the Japanese handed them over to the puppet "Shanghai West Branch of the District Court" on Zhongshan Road on the 24th for a "trial". It is now heard that they will be handed over to the newly established puppet "Shanghai West Branch of the District Court Office" at 92 Gsi Fei Road for further "trials". However, what "charges" will be brought against them are not yet known. The puppet "prosecutor" is a Mr. Liu.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Actively Obtaining Cigarette Business: Five Factories Established in Hongkou, with More Than Ten Brands</h3>
<p>The Japanese are now trying to actively promote the cigarette industry in the war zone in order to replace the potential influence of Chinese and foreign merchants selling various brands of cigarettes in the Jiangnan area. According to investigations, there are five Japanese-owned cigarette factories that have opened in the Hongkou area one after another. The factory sites all belonged to Chinese merchants before the war. One is the Huasheng First Factory, located at Kunming Road, Baoding Road, Hongkou, which is the original site of the former Zhongyuan Cigarette Factory. One is the Huasheng Second Factory, located at Aierkaoke Road, Tangshan Road, which is the original site of the former Xinhua Cigarette Factory. One is the Huasheng Third Factory, located at Tangshan Road, Baoding Road, which is the former Zhengda Overshoe Factory (the machinery was moved from the former Nanyang Huacheng Second Factory). The three factories have a total of more than 2,000 Chinese workers. One is the Dongya Cigarette Factory, located at Baoding Road, Tangshan Road, which is the original site of the former Huadong Cigarette Factory. One is the Gongxing Cigarette Factory, located at Huacheng Road, Huade Road, which is the original site of the former Zhongnan Cigarette Factory. The two factories have a total of 1,600-1,700 Chinese workers. The new brand cigarettes produced by the above five factories, totaling more than ten kinds, are actively promoting sales in the occupied areas.</p>
<h3>British Troops Replacing, New Troops Arrived in Shanghai on the Desheng Ship; Part to Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Desheng ship, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong this time, carries three teams of British troops, a hundred and fifty people, to Qinhuangdao to take over the defense by the original ship. After a part of them arrived in Shanghai, they landed and changed with a certain team of central army in Shanghai. After the ship unloads the goods, it is scheduled to transport the central army to Qinhuangdao today, so no goods are loaded in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spokesman Claims to Have Reached an Agreement with Wang: Says Wang Agreed Not to Withdraw Troops</h3>
<p>Japanese Embassy spokesman Tsurumi Ken said at the press briefing yesterday afternoon that an agreement had been reached between the Japanese government and the head of the "New Central Political Power" in Jingwei on the basic procedures for economic cooperation. Japan has agreed to create a strong and independent government, while Wang has agreed that Japan will not withdraw its troops stationed in China.</p>
<p>The delay in the establishment of the "New Nanjing Government" is due to the ongoing strengthening of various necessary matters. There is a precedent for this, which can be used as an example. After the American Revolutionary War, the young democracy went through a difficult process before forming its government institutions.</p>
<p>Today's establishment of the "New Political Power" can be said to be in the same category. Regarding this point, an American commentator said last night that "the spokesman has obviously made an inappropriate analogy. The establishment of the American democratic country was through its own strength to resist the delusions of invaders, while the "New Central Political Power" relies on the support of the invaders. At the press briefing, foreign journalists also asked, "Wang has recently used wireless broadcasting to persuade the front-line generals of the Chinese army to abandon the National Government and join his command. Is there any response?"</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Japanese army rose to answer one: "There has been a response, but very small. There is a certain Feng, (probably referring to Huang Dawei) leading his 20,000-man army, willing to work for it." After being questioned, the spokesman replied, "I cannot disclose the location of Feng's activities, but I can tell you that Feng 'has the permission of the Japanese army' and is active outside the Japanese-occupied area."

<h3>Valiant Chinese Troops Control Dianshan Lake; Japanese Army Suffers Defeat in Qingpu; Martial Law Declared in Zhujiajiao</h3>
<p>After the 30th Division of the regular Chinese army and the 45th Brigade under Tian Xiushan joined forces on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, their momentum surged. Last month, they severely damaged more than 500 Japanese soldiers from Jiashan between Xitang (20 li northwest of Jiashan) and Taozhuang. Afterward, the Japanese retaliated with air power, destroying most of the houses in the kiln areas of Xitang, Huaqing, Tianningzhuang, Hongxi, and Dingdianmiao. The Chinese army then used a miraculous strategy to recover Xitang with the 45th Brigade, threatening the</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</p>
<p>line. The 30th Division advanced north, controlling the southeast bank of Dianshan Lake, and approached Zhangliantang and Zhujiajiao, which directly unsettled the Japanese troops in Songjiang and Qingpu counties, and indirectly threatened the southwest suburbs of Shanghai. The Japanese army then dispatched more than 300 troops from the Qingpu county garrison, along with reinforcements sent from Shanghai, and advanced southwest beyond Zhujiajiao. Three days ago, they came into contact with the Chinese army in the triangular area of</p>
<p>Ye She's Bank</p>
<p>on the shore of Dianshan Lake. The Chinese side held a superior force and had artillery support. The two sides fought fiercely, marking the second major battle since the Xitang campaign. The reports from foreign media about the fighting in the neighboring counties of the southwest suburbs of this city also originated from this. The rumbling of artillery fire could be clearly heard in the Qingpu and Zhujiajiao areas. The fierce battle lasted for a whole day and night. Due to heavy casualties, the Japanese army retreated to Qingpu county without achieving anything. During the battle, the local villagers</p>
<p>fled to seek refuge, and refugees were seen everywhere. Now, after being comforted by the Chinese military authorities, they have returned one after another. Currently, the Chinese military's influence continues to expand northeastward, so martial law should be imposed in the Qingpu and Zhujiajiao areas.</p>
<h3>Ministry's Response on Post Office Limiting Female Staff: Women Can Still Be Hired Within the Stipulated Scope</h3>
<p>Various women's groups in Shanghai have repeatedly fought for the issue of the post office limiting the use of female postal workers. Yesterday, they received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Communications stating that, as it is now an extraordinary period, postal affairs are becoming increasingly heavy. Most of the existing female staff in various bureaus have already been assigned work, so it was necessary to temporarily impose restrictions on the recent recruitment of postal workers to meet current practical needs. However, various bureaus can still hire women within the stipulated scope to take into account the issue of women's employment. It is said that various women's groups are not satisfied with this measure and are continuing to fight for it.</p>
<h3>Drawing of Sino-Belgian US Dollar Bonds Completed; Totaling Over US$210,000; Payments to Be Made by Banks Starting Next Year</h3>
<p>The 24th redemption of the 1918 Sino-Belgian US Dollar Bonds was drawn yesterday afternoon at the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (Belgian Bank for Foreign Trade) on the Bund. The drawing was attended by Hu Yunqiu, the Chinese manager of the bank, A. Lampo, the director of the bond department, Thomson, an accountant, and representatives from the Race Club. A total of twelve lots were drawn this time, totaling 2,134 bonds, each with a face value of US$100, with a total redemption amount of US$213,800. Payments for the drawn bonds will begin on January 1, 1940. The drawn numbers and quantities are listed below: "75" with 349 bonds, "89" with 432 bonds, "50" with 474 bonds, "48" with 430 bonds, "15" with 345 bonds, "625" with 45 bonds, "0049" with 5 bonds, "2055" with 5 bonds, "0722" with 5 bonds, "39514" with 2 bonds, "31725" with 1 bond, and "455491" with 1 bond, totaling 2,134 bonds.</p>
<h3>Over 20 Shanghai Factories' Cotton Cloth Shipped to the Philippines All Detained; Due to Large Quantities of Japanese Grey Cloth Being Transshipped from Shanghai to the Philippines for Mixed Sales</h3>
<p>Recently, the Philippine authorities have been conducting very strict inspections on cotton cloth shipped from Shanghai. This is because the local Anti-Japanese Association reported that a large quantity of Japanese grey cloth was being transshipped from Shanghai to the Philippines for mixed sales. All cotton cloth from more than 20 dyeing and printing factories in Shanghai, including Hengfeng, Guoguang, Jiufeng, Yuanfeng, Daxinzhen, Gongsheng, Qianfeng, Guangzhong, Tongfeng, Zhongguo, Tiansheng, Yingzhou, Hongdachang, Yuxin, Zhongyi, Zhongguo, Jiuxin, Guoxin, Ronghua, Lunhua, Hengsheng, and Huadong, has now been detained. A valid certificate must be provided within 30 days before it can be considered for release. It is reported that the Export Merchants Association has sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to investigate and handle the matter. The Chamber of Commerce has first sent a telegram to the Chinese Consul-General in the Philippines, requesting a temporary suspension of the disposition during the investigation period.</p>
<h3>Continued Ordering of Tribute Rice; 200,000 Bags Transacted; Yesterday, the Desheng Transported Over 14,000 Bags; Rice Prices Are Rising More Than Falling, the Guild Plans to Suppress Them</h3>
<p>Large batches of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai, as reported earlier. It is now known that yesterday morning, the Jardine Matheson's Desheng arrived in Shanghai, also carrying a large batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong, totaling 14,717 bags. The ship docked at the Roosevelt Wharf on Xinkai River and is currently being unloaded.</p>
<p>Continued Ordering of Tribute Rice</p>
<p>200,000 Bags</p>
<p>Since the price of rice in the city has gradually increased, general firms and public places have been ordering from Saigon. The first batch of more than 20,000 bags arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and there are still many batches on the way to Shanghai. As the source of domestic rice in Shanghai is not smooth and is often obstructed, and the price does not fall, the Shanghai rice industry has requested the French merchant Daofu to order another 200,000 bags of tribute rice from Saigon to meet the food needs of the Shanghai people. It is reported that the transaction price of tribute rice is nearly 30 yuan per stone for each bag of 190 catties. The opening price in the market today is 35 yuan.</p>
<p>Continuous Supply</p>
<p>While tribute rice is continuously arriving in Shanghai and the transportation from various rice-producing areas is not interrupted, the price of rice in Shanghai not only does not fall but is rising day by day, which is suspected by the general public. The reporter of Da Zhong News Agency specially visited a certain gentleman in the rice industry for this reason. According to him, although procurement and transportation in the rice-producing areas in the occupied areas, such as Suzhou, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Kunshan, are difficult, they have not been completely interrupted. The average daily arrival is about 6,000 bags. As for Anqing and Wuhu, only the Japanese merchant Mitsui is allowed to purchase "military rice," and other merchants are generally not allowed to go there for procurement. Even if they have a procurement certificate, they are not allowed to transport it to Shanghai. However, the so-called "military rice" of Mitsui is actually 70% to 80% transported by Japanese merchants to the concession areas for sale. Therefore, the key to this abnormal surge in rice prices does not lie in the obstruction of the source, but in other factors.</p>
<p>Reasons for Price Increase</p>
<p>Still Hoarding</p>
<p>The price of rice in Shanghai is entirely determined by the Rice Market Management Committee based on the quantity of the source, but the real power of the Management Committee is controlled by the Marketing Guild and merchants. Before the war, the merchants in the market only bought and sold on behalf of customers, extracting a commission of 1.5 cents per stone. Moreover, with smooth transportation, they had no real power to manipulate the market price. Since the war, the situation has been reversed. After the successive fall of the rice-producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the daily arrivals can be predicted, so they can manipulate it with ease. There must be quite a few merchants who are benevolent and take the people's livelihood as the premise, but those who "only seek profit" are everywhere. For example, if each of the 100 merchants in Shanghai hoards 300 bags of rice, there will be 30,000 bags. All the arrivals are monopolized, and coupled with the hoarding of people outside the industry, how can the price of rice not soar day by day?</p>
<p>Guild Meeting</p>
<p>Contributing Opinions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Industry Guild believes that the rising rice prices have a great impact on the people's livelihood. They all believe that if no effective measures are taken to suppress this rising trend, the consequences of following the trend and spreading will be unimaginable. Although the guild has no real power to set prices and curb this chaotic market, it can contribute opinions that may be adopted by the Management Committee. It is found that the time limit for purchasing rice in the market is ten days, and payment and delivery are due upon expiration. Therefore, within this ten-day period, the market price changes greatly. Generally, brokers and merchants often take the opportunity to hoard and manipulate. The guild specially held a meeting the day before yesterday to discuss remedial measures, intending to seek the consent of the soybean and rice industry and submit it to the Market Management Committee, requesting that the time limit be shortened immediately. After the time limit is shortened, brokers and merchants without real strength cannot hoard and manipulate, so this may be effective for a while.</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Nationals Celebrate National Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that Yugoslav nationals in Shanghai celebrated National Day today (the 1st). According to this day 21 years ago, the Yugoslavs united to form a nation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Complete Training; Assignments Scheduled</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police commissioned the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in March of this year to recruit 27 Japanese patrol officers. After arriving in Shanghai, they were given six months of training. It is now completed, and starting from the 8th of this month, they will be formally assigned to serve in the Central Police Station and the Hongkou Police Station. It is also learned that the police recently planned to recruit another 20 Japanese police officers. There are about 2,000 applicants. The selection will be held on the 15th of this month at the Memorial Hall in Fukuoka City, Japan. The police will send a Japanese Assistant Superintendent and a Japanese Detective to supervise the examination.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Fractional Currency Coupons to Be Issued; Procedures for Various Industries to Collect; Banks and Money Shops Can Collect Directly; Other Industries Can Exchange at Their Regular Banks</h3>
<p>In order to fundamentally relieve the lack of small denomination currency, the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong requested the approval of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank to commission the American Yongning Company in Hong Kong to print a large number of 1-cent and 5-cent fractional currency coupons. They have already rushed to print them and will gradually deliver them to the Shanghai Branch for distribution starting from the 8th. All banks and money shops (members of the Bankers Association), as well as major companies and major stores, can prepare a letter to collect and exchange them from the bank. Other industries can collect them from their regular accounts (banks and money shops). However, small money shops and tobacco shops are temporarily suspended from supply. As for the substitute coupons of various companies, shops, and tram companies, they should be automatically withdrawn after the second batch of fractional currency is issued. Because the issuance of substitute coupons was not approved by the Ministry of Finance in advance, it cannot be considered legal.</p>

<h3>Vietnamese Government Restricts Travelers From Taking Funds Out of the Country; Chinese Travelers Limited to 100 Yuan; Attention Should Be Paid When Traveling to the Mainland via Vietnam</h3>
<p>The French Indochina government has promulgated measures to manage travelers taking funds out of the country. Those who enter mainland China via Haiphong and Hanoi in French Indochina should pay close attention. The interpretation is recorded as follows: (1) Travelers of all nationalities are subject to management. (2) The funds carried are not limited to Vietnamese currency or foreign currency. (3) The law distinguishes between payment instruments and securities. (4) Payment instruments include currency, banknotes, drafts, checks, letters of credit, and bills that can be exchanged for immediate use. (5) Securities include stocks, bonds, etc., which can be transferred but cannot be immediately converted for use. (6) All persons leaving Vietnam must declare to customs the amount of payment instruments and securities they are carrying.</p>
<p>Restrictions</p>
<p>However, the Shanghai Customs actually exempts travelers from declaring funds within the following specified limits when leaving the country: Chinese, 100 yuan per person; Indians (including all colored races in Asia), 250 yuan per person; Europeans (including all white races), 500 yuan per person. (7) Approval for taking funds out of the country: If a traveler leaving the country exceeds the above-mentioned limit, they should apply for approval from the Foreign Exchange Bureau before they are allowed to take the funds out of the country. The Vietnamese government entrusts the Banque de l'Indochine to handle foreign exchange management. (8) Travelers taking funds out of the country should follow the following regulations according to the nature of their travel:</p>
<p>Resident Travelers</p>
<p>(A) First type of traveler: Those who reside in Vietnam and want to travel abroad temporarily. If the amount carried by this type of traveler exceeds the specified amount, they should submit proof documents such as passport and ship ticket to the Foreign Exchange Bureau for verification. The Foreign Exchange Bureau will determine the amount allowed to be carried based on the traveler's identity. If the travel period is extended, they may be allowed to continue to remit funds for use, but the amount shall not exceed 1,000 Vietnamese currency per day.</p>
<p>Transit Travelers</p>
<p>(B) Second type of traveler: Transit travelers entering the country after December 2, 1939. This type of traveler should fill in the amount of funds they are carrying upon entry, which will be checked and certified by customs for release upon departure. If the funds carried upon departure exceed the reported amount, or if the carried securities are carried, they must apply for approval from the Foreign Exchange Bureau separately. (Inner) Third type of traveler: Transit travelers entering the country before December 2, 1939. This type of traveler is allowed to take out funds of 500 Vietnamese currency or less in accordance with the regulations. If the amount exceeds 500 yuan, they should submit documents sufficient to prove that they actually carried the excess amount before September 9, 1939, to the Foreign Exchange Bureau for verification. If carrying any securities, they should be submitted to the Foreign Exchange Bureau for approval.</p>
<p>Permanent Residence</p>
<p>(D) Fourth type of traveler: Those who originally resided in Vietnam and want to permanently reside abroad. There are no express provisions in the law for this. They can be handled in accordance with the first type of traveler. However, subsequent remittances after leaving the country shall not exceed 1,000 yuan per month, and the period shall be limited to six months.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute in the Leather Goods Industry; Application for Mediation by the Authorities; Notice to Workers to Wait for Resolution Quietly</h3>
<p>The workers of various leather goods factories in the city, due to the current soaring prices and difficult living conditions, have, through the Leather Goods Workers Association, sent a letter to the capitalists, proposing three conditions, including the requirement to increase wages. It is learned that the factory has not yet formally responded to the workers' requests and will convene a joint meeting of various industries tomorrow to discuss and then decide on a solution. It is reported that the labor side sent representative Jin Cai'gen to contact the capitalists once yesterday, and mediated. In order to prevent a labor tide, the Workers Association issued a notice to all workers yesterday to work with peace of mind and wait for a legal resolution quietly.</p>
<h3>Aluminum Coins of Public Buses Also Circulate in Hangzhou; Value of Aluminum Coins Issued Reaches 100,000 Yuan; But the Company Ultimately Failed to Recover the Original Coins; Additional Bus Routes Will Be Opened Next Year to Ease Passenger Flow</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that the public bus companies in the city, in view of the lack of fractional currency, have issued substitute coupons of various denominations from 1 cent to 5 cents. The British-owned China General Omnibus Company purchased machinery at a huge cost to manufacture aluminum substitute coins of varying values to prevent the counterfeiting of substitute coupons. The company originally intended that these aluminum substitute coins could eventually be recovered</p>
<p>And melted into aluminum strips</p>
<p>For manufacturing public bus bodies and other light metal fittings, because the aluminum price of the substitute coins is probably not lower than the face value of the coins. However, to date, the value of aluminum coins issued has exceeded 100,000 yuan, and none have been recovered, and it is said that such aluminum coins are also circulating as far away as Hangzhou. The British-owned China General Omnibus Company continues to issue aluminum coins every day</p>
<p>About 30,000 pieces</p>
<p>When the conductors pay the company at night, they only see a few aluminum coins. The company is studying remedial measures in order to cooperate with the public as much as possible and must deal with the serious situation with new methods. If the issuance of aluminum coins continues, it will be necessary to purchase additional equipment and aluminum to meet the demand. The issue of issuing substitute coupons has also been discussed, but it is feared that counterfeiters will</p>
<p>Take advantage of the opportunity to profit</p>
<p>Therefore, it has not been implemented. Given the current situation, many public bus passengers do not buy tickets and get off the bus because the conductors do not have fractional currency to give change. The company is losing a lot of money as a result. It is hoped that the public will cooperate as much as possible and reduce the duties of the conductors. From next year onwards,</p>
<p>Route 16 Will Be Opened</p>
<p>A public bus, starting from Yichang Road, passing through Gordon Road, Xinzao Road, Carter Road, Avenue Edward VII, Datong Road, Burkill Road, Chengdu Road, Weihaiwei Road, and Race Course Road to Yu Qiaqing Road, will be operated by single-decker public buses to connect the northwest and central areas of the Public Concession and alleviate the acute public transport problem in the city.</p>
<h3>Universal Relief Lunch Association; Saving Lunch Expenses to Help the Distressed; Has Reached Over 2,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Universal Relief Lunch Association in the city was initiated by business figures such as Lu Shaozhang.

<p>The Ministry of Finance issued Announcement Yu Gong Zi No. 3( ): Since the start of the War of Resistance, domestic people and overseas Chinese have enthusiastically donated money, and their enthusiasm for protecting the country is deeply gratifying. However, there are many types of donations, and the collection agencies are different, making registration and auditing difficult. On July 12 of this year, the National Government ordered the promulgation of the Measures for Uniformly Submitting Donations and Funds, ordering them to be implemented, and the Ministry, according to the provisions of Article 4 of the original measures, drafted the Measures for Entrusting the Four Banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture to Handle Various Donations and Funds, submitting them for record and sending a letter to the Four Banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture for investigation and handling. From now on, all donations and funds, domestic ones should be directly handed over by the donors to any one of the four banks for verification and collection, and foreign ones should be uniformly handed over by the donors to the Hong Kong Bank of China for verification and collection. Temporary receipts will be issued first, and then the Ministry will issue receipts printed by the four banks for exchange. If donors designate the use of donations or transfer them to other agencies, the Ministry will handle them separately. This announcement is hereby made for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Promoting the Moral Rearmament Movement; First Day of Special Broadcasting; Explaining the Importance of Moral Rearmament</h3>
<p>The Moral Rearmament Movement around the world has set the 1st to the 3rd of this month for extensive promotion. Shanghai also began to promote it yesterday. The designated special broadcasting times are from 12:45 PM to 1:30 PM daily on the Eastern Radio Station and from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the Gospel Radio Station. Yesterday was the first day of the broadcasting. Dr. Wang Wanbai and his family gave a detailed account on the Eastern Radio Station of the situation after</p>
<p>Moral Rearmament Within the Family</p>
<p>In the evening, the Education and Youth groups broadcast on the Gospel Radio Station. Professor Jin Wuzhou of Shanghai University and students from major middle schools in the city gave speeches in rotation. Based on their personal life experiences, they issued the importance of moral rearmament for education and youth, and their words were extremely pertinent. Here is a summary of the main points: "Currently," the emotions of young people in general are extremely enthusiastic, and everyone has great ambitions to transform society. Their purpose is good, but those who have never achieved significant results are because they excessively despise</p>
<p>Personal Morality</p>
<p>Although we want to transform today's bad society to seek human happiness, if personal morality is swept away, people will not believe what they say and do, and failure is inevitable. The purpose of moral rearmament is to rebuild the world and transform society, but it must start with the moral rearmament of the individual, removing corrupt habits, changing bad habits, and using the four principles of absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love as the criterion of life.</p>
<p>Practice What You Preach</p>
<p>Strive hard, and under God's management, change the whole world. Therefore, young people today must recognize the current difficulties, not rely on emotional impulses, but must know their mistakes and correct them, and extend themselves to others. And today's education must also take the training of moral talents as its responsibility and cultivate good young people as pioneers to open up new lands in the world. It is learned that the movement will continue to broadcast at the scheduled time today. Business figures and several doctors in the city will be the speakers. Ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life can tune in on time.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Company's Wulin Steamer Robbed in Qidong; All Cotton on Board Plundered; Both Sides Opened Fire, Two Bandits Shot; One Bandit Died, One Bandit Captured</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Wulin steamer has recently been sailing between Shanghai and the ports of Beisha, Qidong, and Haimen, transporting goods and passengers. At about 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the Wulin steamer arrived at the Sanhe port in Qidong County and anchored to load flower clothes (i.e., cotton with the seeds removed). Several barges</p>
<p>Fully Loaded With Flower Clothes</p>
<p>Bags, sailed out of the port and approached the Wulin steamer. While loading was in progress, nearly 50 pirates, carrying four submachine guns and Mauser pistols and other new-style military weapons, took six sailing boats and chased out of Sanhe port, swarming to the side of the Wulin steamer, robbing the flower clothes and not allowing them to be loaded onto the ship. The British soldiers escorting the Wulin steamer opened fire to resist, and the pirate ships also</p>
<p>Opened fire in retaliation. The sound of gunfire was chaotic. As a result, the flower clothes on the six barges were finally plundered and taken away. Two pirates were shot and fell to the ground as they climbed onto the steamer. The steamer saw that the flower clothes had been robbed and the two pirates were wounded and captured, so it sailed back to Shanghai. One of the two pirates died of his injuries to the head, chest, and back on the way. The Wulin steamer arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. The shipowner</p>
<p>Reported to the company, who in turn reported to the water police, who informed the French police to take the pirate's body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for examination. They will report to the prosecutor's office of the Special Court No. 2 today to send personnel for examination and handling. The other injured pirate, who had not died, was taken away by personnel from a British warship for investigation. Also, the English "China Press" reported that the Taikoo Company's Wulin steamer, coming to Shanghai from the south, was suddenly attacked by pirates who had been lurking for several months just as it arrived at the mouth of the Yangtze River. As of the afternoon of today (the 1st), Shanghai has still not been able to obtain accurate details. It is only heard that after the pirates appeared, the Wulin steamer immediately sent out a wireless message, and a British gunboat received the message and</p>
<p>Rushed to the rescue. Several pirates were captured by the crew of the Wulin, and the remaining pirates escaped when the British gunboat was about to arrive. It is also heard that several White Russian bodyguards on the ship were injured. The Wulin steamer is expected to arrive at the port at around 4:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Opium Dens and Inns</h3>
<p>Gambling and Taking Commissions</p>
<p>Old Police Station detectives Yang Dechun and Qin Boliang learned that someone was opening a gambling den in Room 468 of the Da Jiangnan Hotel at No. 410 Fujian Road, gathering people to gamble and taking commissions for profit. They gambled all night long. Yesterday evening at around 9:00 PM, they, together with Western patrol leader Gavin, went to the address and arrested the boss Xu Akun and gamblers Lu Lianqing, Zhu Baoxing, Yang Yongfu, etc., totaling 19 people. They seized 74 yuan in gambling money and gambling tools, and took them all to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 4 of the Special Court No. 1. The police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. Judge Dai interrogated them separately and imposed fines.</p>
<h3>A Notorious Gangster in the Zhabei District Operates a Lottery Den with Multiple Listening Posts, Arrested and Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Ding Futang from Changshu, a notorious gangster in the Zhabei district, nicknamed "Little Cifan," habitually ran lottery dens and listening posts, enticing people to gamble and swindling them out of their money. Recently, he was arrested by Detective Feng Qishan of the General Inspectorate's Chinese Detective Division at his residence, No. 41 Yongji Lane, Xinza Road. Together with his accomplice Feng Shusheng from Suzhou, he was detained and escorted to the First Special Court, where they were interrogated and taken into custody, as previously reported. During the reinvestigation, detectives handling the case discovered that Ding and Feng had operated lottery dens and listening posts at four locations between September 1st and November 2nd of this year: Room 211 of the Xinzha Hotel at No. 841 Xinzha Road, the Longquan Tea House at No. 21, Lane 812 Xinzha Road, No. 1, Lane 121 Maigen Road, and No. 11, Lane 510 Datong Road, enticing people to gamble.

Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed charges under Articles 268 and 282 of the Criminal Code and presented the case, stating that several convicted prisoners had submitted proposals from the West Prison and could be interrogated. However, to ensure clarity, he requested separate interrogations. Judge Dai conducted separate interrogations. Ding and others gave evasive answers.

<h3>Volunteer Night School Teacher Xia Runsen Wrongfully Arrested and Humiliated, Sues Chen Guansheng for Deprivation of Liberty, Defendant Files Countersuit, Court Adjourns for Verdict</h3>
<p>Xia Runsen, a local volunteer night school teacher at the New New Primary School at No. 429 Route Paul Beau, French Concession, retained lawyer Wang Shizong to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, suing Chen Guansheng (28 years old, from Shantou, Guangdong), the legal representative of the Baochang Money Exchange at No. 188 North Henan Road (now closed), for bringing bailiffs and detectives to the school and</p>
<p>Intentionally Ordering Arrest</p>
<p>Of an unrelated person, in a case of deprivation of liberty.</p>
<p>It is claimed that the defendant, in his capacity as the legal representative of Baochang Exchange, had filed a lawsuit against Xia Runlong in the Civil Division of the Court for rent arrears and eviction. After the execution proved ineffective, on the morning of October 27th at 9:00 AM, he brought bailiffs and detectives to the New New Primary School, falsely claiming that the plaintiff was Xia Runlong and ordering his arrest. The plaintiff protested, stating that he was Xia Runsen, Xia Runlong's younger brother, and that they were</p>
<p>Distinct Individuals</p>
<p>Who could not be confused. He presented his name card and personal seal, but all were in vain. The defendant claimed that detaining his brother would force the surrender of his brother. As a result, the plaintiff was wrongfully arrested and humiliated. When the execution court opened, the defendant insisted on his previous statement, demanding that the plaintiff be detained. Only after Wu Jizhen, the principal of the New New Primary School, presented the plaintiff's diploma and other documents was he released, having suffered half a day of</p>
<p>Detention and Escort</p>
<p>And the humiliation of the loss of freedom. Furthermore, Baochang Exchange had already ceased operations, and the owner was surnamed Zheng, and the manager was Chen Lizhou. The defendant was not an employee of Baochang Exchange. Moreover, Baochang Exchange had dealt with Xia Runlong for a long time and knew him well. The defendant's false accusation, calling a deer a horse, was an illegal insult and deprivation of liberty, a clear violation of Article 302 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, the defendant</p>
<p>Solicits Lawsuits</p>
<p>For a living and has no fixed address. The plaintiff requests that he be arrested and prosecuted according to the law. The court accepted the complaint and, the day before yesterday, Judge Zhang Minsheng opened the trial. The defendant retained lawyer Qu Shiji to defend him and filed a counterclaim accusing the plaintiff of slander, property damage, and theft. After a detailed interrogation of both parties, the court adjourned for a verdict. The defendant Chen Guansheng was released on bail pending review.</p>
<h3>The Case of Chen Linshi's Death, Not Related to the Hospital, Chaozhou Hospital Implicated, Court Declares Innocence</h3>
<p>The Chaozhou Heji Hospital was previously implicated in the case of a patient, Chen Linshi, who died shortly after being admitted. The French Concession police discovered that she had died of poisoning and detained a number of related witnesses to investigate, exhuming the body for examination. In addition to prosecuting Chen Agen, Xiao Yongshui, and Lin Zaokun, they also accused Hu Xianrong, an employee of the Chaozhou Heji Hospital, of knowingly failing to report the incident and assisting in the concealment of evidence, as well as violating police regulations, and filed a public prosecution with the Second Special District District Court. After a retrial, Judge Liao of the court announced the verdict yesterday, finding Hu Xianrong not guilty. The court found that when Chen Linshi arrived at the hospital for treatment, she was already beyond saving. The hospital, according to procedure, could not admit her and did not provide any treatment. Therefore, it was impossible to discover the cause of her death, and there was no basis for reporting the incident to the police. The charges of assisting in the concealment of evidence and violating police regulations were naturally without merit. The case has now been resolved, and all misunderstandings about the hospital should be dispelled.</p>
<h3>The Local Weather Remains Severe, Below Freezing Yesterday, Minus 1.4 Degrees Celsius, Pacific Hurricane Has No Impact</h3>

Although a hurricane is currently occurring in the Pacific Ocean, it will not affect the local area, so there is no need to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Waterproof Canvas Factory Manager Arrested for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Du Hengfu from Ningbo was the factory manager of the China Waterproof Canvas Factory at No. 1729 Daxilu Road, and lived nearby at No. 1712. However, Du had malicious intentions and, from September 8th to November 18th of this year, embezzled 86 bolts of canvas, valued at 4,500 yuan, and pawned them at Fuyuan and Xinda pawnshops on Daxilu Road to obtain cash. Wang Shishui, the manager of the factory, discovered the embezzlement and reported it to the Jing'an Temple police. Detective Tie Guobin arrested Du and retrieved 69 bolts of the stolen canvas from the pawnshops. They were all taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, Du was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed charges according to the law and requested a postponement.

<p>Wang Jinlin (31 years old), from Danyang, residing at No. 10 Shunyang Lane, Caishi Street, French Concession, was recently discovered by Li Dacheng, a Chinese detective of the Huishi Police Station, to be selling counterfeit money for profit in collaboration with Shen Akun (38 years old), from Huzhou. The previous day, Yue Aotong, a Cantonese informant,</p>
<p>Posing as a Customer</p>
<p>Secretly went to Wang Jinlin's residence and purchased 100 counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China for every real one yuan coin (marked with a Hui character stamp), agreeing to deliver the goods at 8:00 PM on the same day near Suzhou Road west of Xinzha Bridge in the Public Concession. At the appointed time, Wang Jinlin indeed arrived with 83 counterfeit one-yuan banknotes and one counterfeit five-yuan banknote. Detective Li and informant Yue Aotong</p>
<p>Arrived Slowly</p>
<p>And arrested him on the spot. Wang confessed that he had purchased the counterfeit banknotes from his friend Shen Akun, who lived at No. 224, Lane 84, Kangti Road, Wanfang Road, French Concession, for 12 yuan for every 100 one-yuan banknotes. The detectives rushed to the French Concession, and together with French police detectives, secretly went to Shen's residence and arrested him, bringing him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed charges under Article 196 of the Criminal Code</p>
<p>Counterfeiting Currency</p>
<p>And other crimes, stating that the investigation revealed that the defendant Shen Akun had committed a similar offense in October 1936 and had been sentenced to two years and six months in prison, showing no remorse for his crimes. He requested a postponement. The counterfeit banknotes were presented for inspection (note that these counterfeit banknotes are well-printed and have a watermark, making them indistinguishable from genuine ones). The two defendants gave evasive confessions, refusing to reveal the location of the counterfeiting operation. Judge Huang Risheng ordered their continued detention pending a retrial.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news report in your newspaper on the first of this month stating that "Xu Xinmin, also known as Yi Qin, the deputy director of the Tianjin French Concession China General Chamber of Commerce bank branch, absconded to Shanghai with funds," we would like to clarify that our bank does not have a branch in Tianjin, nor does it have anyone named Xu Xinmin. We hereby request a correction. Sincerely, China General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the report in your newspaper entitled "Failure to Return Deposits for Building Houses," much of the content does not correspond to the facts. The houses contracted by Sha Yunwu and others total twelve. Due to the repeated amendments of the plans by the French Municipal Council and the failure to sign the approval, the project was only half completed and then completely demolished. The Zhenxing Company suffered significant losses, which, according to the law, should be shared by all shareholders and subscribers, including Sha Yunwu. I, as the general manager, have an unavoidable responsibility to reach a settlement with them, as permitted by law. The news report neglected to mention that the execution was directed at the property, and my office is still located on the fifth floor and has not been closed. I hereby request that your newspaper promptly make a correction to avoid misrepresentation. Sincerely, Lawyer Wang Liwu. December 1st.</p>

<h3>Finance. Hong Kong Firms Absorb Large Quantities. Gold Prices Experience a Shocking Surge. High Point Reaches Four Thousand and Fifty Yuan. Underlying Trend Remains Strong After Closing. Trading Is Extremely Active.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash bar market situation, following the previous night's surge, became even more intense, especially in the evening session when rumors spread that Hong Kong firms were transferring huge sums of money to purchase gold in the local market, causing gold prices to jump sharply. Buyers rushed into the market, pushing prices past the 4,000 yuan mark, with a high of 4,050 yuan. The momentum was truly astonishing. Most observers were optimistic that the high gold prices of a few months ago might be revisited. The morning opening was already high at 3,950 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan from the previous day. However, due to the overnight market, prices had already reached around 3,940 yuan outside the market. Subsequently, Hong Kong firms made further advances, rising another 20 yuan to 3,970 yuan. But retail investors were trading relatively calmly. The midday closing was only 3,942 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, in addition to the tightening of the foreign exchange market, news that Hong Kong firms were fiercely buying gold with huge sums of money led many retail investors to open new long positions and add to their holdings. Although some gold firms took profits, buyers outnumbered sellers, pushing prices past the 4,000 yuan mark to a high of 4,050 yuan. In the end, prices closed at 4,045 yuan, a significant increase of 120 yuan from the previous day. Trading was extremely active, with approximately 3,000 taels changing hands. Jewelry gold prices initially remained stable, but later surged by 10 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>The Bar Market Also Jumps by Hundreds of Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each lot (ten taels) initially showed lingering effects from the previous day. Hong Kong firms continued to commission money changers to buy on their behalf, and the opening price was 25 yuan higher. Securities firms bought 20 taels for gold firms at 3,950 yuan. In a flash, prices jumped another 20 yuan, with money changers buying 20 taels for jewelry firms at 3,970 yuan. At this time, the atmosphere was very heated. Suddenly, some gold firms seized the opportunity to take profits, while buyers from other regions lost interest, leading to a downward correction. Prices soon fell by 38 yuan, with money changers trading 30 taels at 3,932 yuan. Then, securities firms came to lift the market, and prices rose again by 13 yuan, with securities firms buying 30 taels from money changers at 3,945 yuan. Afterwards, jewelry firms and cash firms began to sell, leading to another decline of 15 yuan, with jewelry firms and cash firms selling a total of 50 taels to gold firms at 3,930 yuan. At that time, gold firms continued to buy on behalf of customers, while money changers came to the rescue, pulling prices up by 15 yuan. Money changers bought 20 taels from securities firms at 3,945 yuan. Later, retail investors sold, and prices fell slightly by 8 yuan, with money changers selling 10 taels to jewelry firms at 3,937 yuan. As noon approached, foreign exchange suddenly reported weakness, exciting the market. Money changers and some gold firms competed to absorb the supply, pushing prices up by 5 yuan, with gold firms buying 20 taels from money changers at 3,942 yuan, the midday closing price. It was reported that the underlying trend remained strong after the closing, with prices rising to 3,955 yuan. In the afternoon, prices continued to rise. The opening price rose to 3,960 yuan, and then jewelry firms came to buy, pushing prices up by another 10 yuan, with jewelry firms buying 20 taels from securities firms at 3,970 yuan. Then, some gold firms sold, causing a slight pullback of 15 yuan, with gold firms selling 10 taels to money changers at 3,955 yuan. Afterwards, foreign exchange suddenly reported tightening again, boosting confidence. Money changers and gold firms vigorously bought on behalf of Hong Kong firms, and sellers were scarce, causing prices to soar by 85 yuan, with gold firms buying 30 taels from securities firms at 4,040 yuan. Then, jewelry firms took profits, causing a pullback of 20 yuan, with jewelry firms selling 20 taels to gold firms at 4,020 yuan. Subsequently, money changers started buying again, absorbing over 300 taels. Although retail investors took the opportunity to sell, gold firms also had a good appetite, so prices were pulled up by another 30 yuan, with money changers buying 20 taels from jewelry firms at 4,050 yuan. Afterwards, some money changers sold slightly, causing a slight decline of 15 yuan, with money changers selling 20 taels to gold firms at 4,035 yuan. Finally, due to gold firms buying on behalf of Hong Kong firms again, prices were raised to 4,045 yuan at the closing. As a result, prices surged by another 120 yuan from the previous day. The underlying trend remained strong after the closing, with 4,055 yuan being hard to obtain. Throughout the day, there was a fluctuation of 120 yuan. The cash gold price sold by gold firms was 10 yuan higher than the bar price, while the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially remained at 400 yuan at Dahong Bank. At 2:40 PM, prices were raised by 5 yuan, and at 3:45 PM, they were raised by another 5 yuan. As a result, Dahong Bank changed the price to 410 yuan. The prices at Xin Bank were the same, with buying prices reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Firms Purchase Forward US Dollars, Foreign Exchange Market Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC list prices. The black market for British and American exchange rates has been calm in the morning sessions recently, but the evening sessions have seen changes. The opening price saw US exchange rates tighten by 0.03125 due to a reduction of 1.75 points in overseas US-British exchange rates, while British gold remained flat. After the opening, the situation was stagnant, and few people paid attention. However, after 11:00 AM, Hong Kong firms suddenly began selling large amounts of US dollars, estimated at around 250,000 yuan. However, supply and demand remained unchanged, and the market appeared soft. Dong HSBC and Yooli and other outsiders were very keen to buy, accepting all comers. Seeing this, a few speculators joined in, so the noon closing saw British gold at only 4 shillings 7.8125 pence and US exchange rates at only 7.71875 yuan. The afternoon began calmly, but after 2:00 PM, Western firm Sassoon began buying aggressively, and at the same time, cotton yarn firms began purchasing forward US dollars, causing the market to tighten again. By the closing, British gold had fallen to 4 shillings 7.1875 pence and US exchange rates had fallen to 7.59375 yuan, the lowest prices of the day. As a result, compared to the previous day, British exchange rates had tightened by 0.09375 and US exchange rates had softened by 0.21875. The trend for futures was the same as for spot.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Continues to Sell</p>

The central bank's listed prices for all exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling price for spot exchange rates at banks was 4 shillings 8.125 pence for British gold and 7.78125 yuan for US exchange rates, flat for British and tighter by 0.03125 for US compared to the previous closing. This was due to the decline in exchange rates. After the opening, the market was quiet, with little attention and no price changes. After HSBC announced the list prices, and the silver tax was revealed to be 0.75, the market remained quiet for a long time. However, after 11:00 AM, Hong Kong firms suddenly began selling large amounts of US dollars, estimated at around 250,000 yuan. But HSBC and Yooli banks were very keen to buy, so there was no impact. HSBC bought 200,000 yuan and Yooli absorbed 50,000 yuan, both at 7.8125 yuan. At that time, a few speculators saw the strong buying by HSBC and other banks and also joined in, while the selling from Hong Kong firms subsided, and outside interest was weak, causing the market to soften slightly. By the noon closing, the selling price for spot exchange rates at banks was only 4 shillings 7.8125 pence for British gold and 7.71875 yuan for US exchange rates, compared to the morning opening, British was tighter by 0.03125 and US was softer by 0.0625.</p>
<p>Sassoon Suddenly Buys</p>

<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise: US Dollar Notes at $13.50</h3>
<p>Yesterday, demand for British and American gold pounds was strong, causing market prices to soar. This was due to Hong Kong banks eagerly absorbing cash and clients taking advantage of low prices to buy gold pounds. The price of gold pounds surged to $97. Demand for British and American dollar notes was also strong, with limited supply due to tight foreign exchange controls. US dollar notes opened in the morning at $12.875, then gradually strengthened, reaching $13.15 in the evening market. Hong Kong francs, Annam piasters, and other currencies also saw brisk demand and high market prices. Canadian and Philippine pesos followed the rise of US dollar notes, showing steady increases.

<h3>Securities: Foreign Shares Active – Domestic Bonds Still in the Doldrums</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market yesterday remained in a state of sideways movement with a slightly bearish tone. A period of consolidation has created a numb atmosphere. Occasionally, long positions emerge, and short positions take the opportunity to cover. Short covering is followed by long positions taking the opportunity to sell, indicating that both sides have lost firm convictions. The situation seems to be gradually becoming stagnant. This kind of dull atmosphere will not easily change in the short term. Trading was moderate in the morning, with some closing and opening of positions in the afternoon. On the selling side, Dafeng, Lianhe, Maoqin, and retail investors were mostly selling. On the 20th, there was buying both in the morning and afternoon. Tiansheng, Tonglian, Hongda, and others had demand. However, the prices of Class C and E shares showed no change, while others had slight fluctuations of five cents to one dime. The total transaction volume was estimated at over $600,000. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Share	High	Low	Closing	Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A	30.20	30.3	30.3	+0.03</p>

<p>In stock trading, 200 Hanyeping shares were traded at a price of $2.325.</p>

With the expiration of the current term of the Donglan, those taking profits continued to sell. In addition, many floating accounts were closed. However, during the buying period, well-known shares were supported by buyers, with telephone shares being particularly strong. The highest price reached $23.50. Rubber shares, including Universal, Popular, and others, were actively traded, but prices showed little change. Transactions were most active for shares such as Zhaoshu, Gegeke, Luohualan, Gezhi, and Taihua Kangsha.</p>
<p>London, 30th: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in the prices of various bonds.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Overseas Prices Rise Sharply, Cotton Trading Becomes More Active</h3>
<p>Cotton trading has regained momentum. This is because cotton markets in India and the United States are rising steadily, boosting confidence. Dealers are buying and selling to each other. Under these circumstances, factories are also actively purchasing. Shenxin No. 9 Mill released a large batch of cotton yarn the previous day, and yesterday supplemented with 1,300 bales of American cotton, which is cheaper than Indian cotton. Qingniao is also increasing its imports of foreign cotton. Transactions among dealers are mostly focused on "white package" cotton, causing market prices to rise steadily. The price of Tong cotton has reached $152.50, up $2.50 from the previous day. However, Japanese factory acceptance remains slow, while supply from Northern Jiangsu is smooth. 6,222 bales of Tong cotton arrived at the wharf, along with 921 bales of Changyu yarn and 4,680 bales of Beisha Dong. Today, 20 bales will be shipped to Xiamen and 80 bales to [illegible].</p>
<p>Another report on foreign cotton prices: the New York cotton market has seen a strong upward trend in recent days. The market opened strong yesterday morning, with speculators buying in large quantities. In addition, telegrams from Liverpool and Bombay reported rising prices, causing extraordinary excitement. Spot traders are also very active due to the large number of transactions, resulting in a fairly firm market. As a result, closing prices were up 67 to 16 points from the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose another 18 rupees. Egyptian cotton rose over 60 points, and Liverpool cotton rose 25 pence.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading: recently, all parties have focused on the soaring cotton market overseas, and cotton yarn has also been pulled up. The day before yesterday, Shenxin released nearly 10,000 bales of cotton yarn, so yesterday they purchased 8,000 to 9,000 bales of American cotton. Japanese factories, due to Indian yarn merchants reporting that Indian cotton prices have risen too much, resulting in high costs, purchased over 10,000 bales of cotton yarn extensively from Japan. Yesterday, Japanese factories also searched for over 10,000 bales of American cotton, all for immediate shipment. The prices of American cotton yesterday, based on an exchange rate of $7.75, converted to the factory delivery price are as follows:</p>
<h3>Traffic Obstruction: Yarn Sales to South China Impeded, Raw Cotton Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat, but current yarn transport is not smooth. Sales to South China and [illegible] are slow due to transportation problems. Therefore, buyers are hesitant, and prices are stagnant. However, with the American cotton market rising steadily and showing no signs of stopping, which will inevitably lead to higher replacement costs, the yarn market should move forward. Unfortunately, sales are poor, so the pressure from [illegible] is strong. The amount of yarn released by Zhongxin No. 9 yesterday was 10,400 bales.</p>
<p>The current yarn market's morning sentiment is unanimously bullish, saying that with the soaring foreign cotton market, yarn prices should rise. Opening prices rose $4-5, with 20-count Shuangma priced at $677. As soon as this price was announced, buyers quickly [illegible], but actual demand remained weak, and prices soon fell again. Another explanation is that factories have recently released too many batches, and most merchants have cotton yarn in their hands. According to half-day trading statistics, 1,083 bales were traded. The market price of 20-count Shuang Kun was $4, Tiannv rose $2.50, and [illegible] Diqiu rose $1. Today (2nd), 80 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, 80 pieces to Tu Le, 265 pieces to [illegible] Shu Port, and 105 pieces to Xiamen. The amount of yarn purchased by various regions is listed below:</p>
<p>Dealers: 830	[Illegible]: 70	Jiangxi: 30</p>
<p>Inland: 130	Ningbo: 30	Total: 1,084</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Weevils Stir Up Trouble, A Blow from Foreign Rice, Hoarders Immediately Retract Their Hands</h3>
<p>After a brief tightening of the rice market, yesterday 20+ train cars of goods from Kunshan, Taicang, Suzhou, and Tongxiang arrived, boosting confidence further. Buyers, based on the previous day's situation, remained firm, creating an opportunity for speculators. From the opening, they sold their profitable goods at high prices, while simultaneously buying in low-priced goods. The situation quickly became chaotic, stirring up public sentiment. Everyone was hoping for good news, and they all followed the trend, scrambling to buy. As a result, merchants were able to sell, and the price of both Japonica and Indica rice rose by $1. At the same time, hoarders became increasingly interested, taking advantage of the high prices. Local shops thought that with the winter solstice approaching, it was time to stock up, fearing that the market would not fall back down under manipulation. They bought from each other, so by midday, prices rose even more, reaching about $2. As prices were soaring, the Beiyang gang, which owns a large amount of foreign rice, initially held their goods, observing. Taking advantage of the speculators' manipulation, and with the market局 [organization] commotion, they launched a large batch of foreign rice, quoting $35 and actually selling at $34.70. The market was immediately hit, and most buyers, who were originally elated, were suddenly disappointed and no longer interested in buying. The speculators felt the pain, having expected unexpected profits. Now, they could only lament their misfortune. This was indeed the deserved outcome for those who manipulated the market. Therefore, the evening market suddenly weakened. According to the closing market, the early market rose sharply, with Japonica and Indica rice all rising by $1-2 compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>Buyers, following the previous day's upward trend, saw a strong increase at the opening. Brokers and hoarders were still greedy. The early market once rose by $1.3-5. Then, with new foreign rice transactions completed and deliveries expected soon, some profitable groups sold with the market, and the afternoon market began to fall back by $0.4-5. However, Gao Wu Xian rice still opened at $34.70, with few arrivals and sales. The total market only had over 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>The morning price of foreign rice rose sharply, with dealers continuing to buy, and the foreign exchange rate also impacting prices. Major buyers absorbed more rice. Saigon, Annam Japonica, and Siamese rice all opened at around $35 to $35.50. Then, with two new batches of transactions completed, the sharp morning increase of over $1 fell back by $0.4-5. According to reports, 500 tons were sold by Jianyuan yesterday at a price of $39.50. 600-700 tons were sold by Dafu, with No. 1 priced at $39 and No. 2 Saigon at $37.50.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, Yih Wo and Desheng Shipping transported 14,717 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, unloading at the Jinliyuan Wharf warehouse.</p>
<h3>Flour Mill Prices Rise Another $0.20, Wheat Prices Reach $12.50</h3>
<p>Flour prices have increased again. No. 2 boat (brand) prices have reached $7.80, up $0.20 from the previous day. Due to the turbulent times and frequent price increases, in addition to consistent activity to digest supply, hoarders are also accumulating in the market, boosting confidence. Sales are [illegible] increasing. Therefore, No. 2 flour [illegible] rose $0.20. Running cart [?] prices even opened above $8. Other flours from inland and Japanese factories, such as Fengli brand, also rose $0.1-2. Total sales were estimated at over 50,000 bags, with actual sales accounting for about half. The rest was speculative. Factories are paying close attention to this, so they are still [illegible] controlling the supply.</p>
<p>Wheat supply remains scarce. Due to frequent price increases from lower production areas, and with flour mill prices rising again, those holding goods are naturally waiting for higher prices and accumulating, unwilling to sell lightly. They are only willing to supply small amounts, so [illegible] procurement is difficult, and there is no large quantity available. As a result, it is difficult to purchase. However, there were five cars of transactions in the market, with Wuxi wheat priced at $12.4-7. Suzhou wheat even opened at $12.50, setting a new high price.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Moved to South China, Sesame Factories and Hoarders are Eager</h3>
<p>Yellow soybeans [illegible] maintain the market's sentiment and remain relatively strong. Market prices mostly continue to rise, and the overall situation has not yet declined. Yesterday, the market price of yellow soybeans rose by over $0.2. In addition to local factories and hoarders, buyers from South China and Singapore are also making inquiries. Two cars of Bengbu soybeans were priced at $16. Over 100 bags of Chongming sand yellow were priced from $15.7 to 16. 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans were priced at $15.5. Two cars of Nanjing soybeans were priced from $15.3 to 5. Over 100 bags of Jiangbei soybeans were priced at $14.3.</p>
<p>Sesame [illegible] actual sales remain unchanged. Although trading is lively, it is entirely driven by the desire of hoarders. A total of 250 bags of Hankou sesame were traded, with prices close to the market price. 200 bags of Changzhou sesame, 100+ bags of Yangzhou sesame, 60 bags of Nanjing sesame, 50 bags of Guandian snow sesame, 50 bags of Anqing sesame, and 30 bags of Jiujiang sesame were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday (1st), 635 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha. Today, 185 bags of beans were shipped to Xiamen, and 4,720 bags of [illegible] and 360 bags of groundnuts were shipped to Hong Kong. 500 cans and 40 cases of peanut oil were also shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Red Sugar Trading is Very Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market [illegible] Dutch telegram reported an increase of 0.30, so the price of No. 1 crude white sugar was Dutch currency 11.75 O.L.F., so the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's market price shifted and tightened. Current cargo (No. 24 crude white sugar) at this warehouse was $52.5, new cargo at other warehouses was $53-53.5, old cargo was $51.5-52.5, and transit cargo was $42-42.5, all up $0.5. Taikoo's cube sugar rose fully. Dong Warehouse B was $54.5-55.5, West Warehouse was $55-55.5, the rest was Siamese, [Illegible] H was $38.5-39 for cart red, and Dutch red was $40.5-41. The price of white sugar overall rose $0.5. Zhenji No. 1 was $52.5, and Nos. 2, 3, and 4 was Siamese. This No. 1 crystal was $63, Jingming crystal was $64.5, also up $0.5. Only red sugar from the National Sugar Company was relatively active. The Geng gang offered 1,004 bags of Chong Dong Xiang at $34 [illegible], and the Xinghua gang offered 100 bags of Maige red at $39.7.</p>
<h3>Coal: Uniform Price for Coal Balls – Already High at $70</h3>
<p>The coal ball business is normally a busy season in winter. This year, the local population has increased, and the demand is even greater. The total output of various large and small factories is 3,000-4,000 tons per day, which is still insufficient to distribute. The situation continues to be strong, and factory prices have mostly increased, recently reaching a uniform price. Starting December 1st, the same trade will sell a coal ball for $61 from the factory, and it will be $63 delivered. Customers will receive it for $66. There was another change at 4 pm, with the same trade increasing the price to $6 more and customers still paying $70.</p>

<h3>Couple's Knowledge: Weak Men Will Find It Hard to be Husbands</h3>

<p>(Hours) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed on Sundays</p>
<p>To be a man, one must be strong and vigorous. The so-called "manly man" not only displays power in his career, making people recognize him as a dignified man, but also plans strategies and commands with ease. At the same time, women also adore this kind of great man. He is as hard as iron and as soft as cotton, with love as deep as the sea and happiness like a fairy tale. He is truly the master of women's hearts and the provider of spiritual nourishment. Only such a man is worthy of being called a real man and a great husband! Conversely, if a man is promiscuous in his youth, engaging in bad habits such as masturbation and homosexuality, or suffers from spermatorrhea and neglects treatment, or marries early and has many wives, indulging in excessive lust, depleting the endocrine fluids in his reproductive glands, he will inevitably suffer from premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, lack of offspring, brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, neurasthenia, and many other symptoms. These men often have an unattractive appearance, a sallow complexion, and a weak spirit. Or, they are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, becoming tired before labor, fearing cold and difficulty. This has a serious impact on their studies and careers, leading to failure. In the sexual lives of couples, they are also unable to achieve satisfaction, or even unable to perform at all. How can this not arouse hatred in the hearts of beautiful women and lead to the breakdown of love! Frankly speaking, marriage is a union based on sexual relations. A fulfilling sexual life can lay the foundation for love between couples. If sexual life is not harmonious or unfulfilled, it is better to have none at all. The quarrels and disputes between couples, or even tragedies such as adultery, elopement, separation, and divorce, often have underlying reasons related to sexual relations.</p>
<p>Weak men will find it difficult to be husbands! They may simply find it difficult to be a person! The complexities of the world and the weight of responsibility require energy to strive. Without energy, they will only be eliminated! However, weakness can be prevented and remedied. According to the latest medical research, the various weakness symptoms mentioned above can be treated with endocrine supplementation therapy to the reproductive glands, which can have a "rejuvenating" effect. The potent animal reproductive hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" extracts the endocrine essences from the reproductive glands of apes, bears, deer, sea dogs, and other animals based on this principle, and is made using scientific replication methods, preserving all the components. Therefore, it is of high quality and reliable efficacy, surpassing any similar preparation. After taking it, the essence is produced and the kidneys are replenished in one day and night, nourishing the brain and activating blood circulation. Continuous use promotes development, nourishes nerves, and the above symptoms can be completely cured within a month. Continuous use for a winter can increase body weight and prolong life. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can achieve the miraculous effect of returning to youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take the sperm-strengthening drug "Hymelt's Sperm Consolidating Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage for even faster results! Those who can come to our clinic for new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections can be guaranteed a cure.</p>
<h3>Beauty: Breasts are Beautiful in Winter</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Some say that in winter, the word "beauty" has no meaning for women. This is not true. The beauty of women can be seen not only in the summer when clothing is light and the richness of the curves is evident, but also in the cold, harsh winter. A woman with a healthy and beautiful body not only has a rosy complexion and delicate skin, without any roughness or gray-white cracks, but also has two steamed bun-like breasts in front, rising high even when wearing thick clothing. At the same time, the buttocks are also plump and soft. The heavy clothing does not hinder their lovely curves. As for those who are thin and weak, suffering from menstrual problems, leucorrhea, anemia, malnutrition, and have had multiple pregnancies resulting in a loss of health, their breasts are withered and their beauty is lost. In this cold winter, they feel especially cold, and others see them as thin and pitiful! Even if their faces are covered with cosmetics, they will unceremoniously float up in this cold weather. Patches and spots still reveal the pale face underneath. Even if they are wearing a gorgeous cheongsam, their back is straight, and their chest is flatter than if ironed. Even old men know that they are not healthy and beautiful. Even if you use all your efforts to disguise, can you still wear thick clothes to cover this ugliness in the room after a bath? Moreover, when "a cold night descends and the golden curtains are lowered, and the lovers mimic double flying in the quilt," where will you escape? Therefore, "true gold fears no fire," and artifice will ultimately fail. The only reliable method is to take the ovarian endocrine preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su" during this time of supplementation. After taking it for a day, it can nourish the ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop leucorrhea. If you continue to take it for a season, not only will the withered breasts rise again, but also the tissue and sallow skin will become tender and delicate. The effect is so great that it cannot be compared with similar preparations on the market. Even ginseng, velvet antler, and pearl powder are not enough to compete with it for strengthening the body and maintaining beauty. Therefore, it is praised all over the world, and progressive women consider it to be their only benefactor of beauty.</p>
<h3>The Root Treatment of Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui</p>
<p>"For a seven-year illness, seek three years of moxa." This means that diseases must be treated fundamentally for the best results. If you only seek temporary and superficial effects, the disease will not be cured and will cause future problems! Most young people suffer from spermatorrhea due to behaviors such as masturbation, homosexuality, early marriage, and promiscuity, which damage the sexual nerves and loosen the sperm gate. Spermatorrhea caused by sexual stimulation in dreams at night is a mild form of nocturnal emission. If this is neglected, the drops will turn into a river, and the increasingly loose sperm gate may lead to spermatorrhea. Seminal fluid is physiologically the so-called reproductive gland endocrine fluid. Its components contain large amounts of precious substances such as the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, adrenal cortex, and testicular gland. If spermatorrhea is not stopped, it will not only directly damage vitality and damage reproductive function, but also affect development and reduce metabolism, leading to premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, lack of offspring, brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, and premature aging. These young people will inevitably be depressed. Students will fall behind in their studies and may even drop out of school! Those engaged in industry and commerce will find their jobs difficult to handle and may even lose their jobs! In addition, due to their unattractive appearance and sallow complexion, they are often abandoned by the opposite sex in social settings and hated by their wives in married life. The family tragedies and descents into the sea of suffering that result are countless! Therefore, it is imperative to seek radical treatment for spermatorrhea as early as possible. The only way to treat it is to take the world-famous medicine for spermatorrhea, "Hymelt's Sperm Consolidating Pills," which has a special effect of calming nerves and stopping spermatorrhea on the same night. This agent is secretly prepared by the German medical saint Dr. Hymelt and has the miraculous effect of consolidating the sperm gate and calming the nerves. People who take it will find it effective. However, with the prevalence of counterfeit and inferior drugs today, be sure to recognize the "Hymelt" mark when purchasing to avoid being confused and causing delays! Those who have had spermatorrhea for a long time and have the above-mentioned symptoms of loss must also take the potent animal reproductive gland preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to fundamentally nourish the brain and kidneys and increase essence and blood. Continuous use for a winter will surely cure all diseases, increase body weight, and prolong life. Patients who can come to our clinic for new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections can be guaranteed a cure.</p>

<h3>Research and Blind Obedience</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongjie</p>
<p>The Language Exhibition has closed. From a literary perspective, we believe that the most valuable exhibits there were the characters on the bronze ware, oracle bones, and black pottery. The application of oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions in researching new classical texts is indeed a new progress in the study of classics in the past three hundred years. Therefore, if this public solicitation and exhibition of language exhibitions can yield gains in the study of classics, it would be the greatest achievement in literature.</p>
<p>Here is some introductory knowledge about studying the classics.</p>
<p>Classics is the most difficult thing to study in any literary field. According to Mr. Wang Guowei, there are three reasons: First, errors and omissions. Second, ancient language is different from modern language. Third, idioms. From the Han Dynasty to the early Qing Dynasty, although "classics" was used as an important material in the process of academic research, they all took the wrong path in studying classics. The Han school focused on family traditions and teachers' sayings, and did not treat classics as a material for literary research; instead, they regarded it as incantations. When classics came into the hands of the Song school, they used classics to talk about their Neo-Confucianism; they explained classics based on a kind of ideal conjecture. Therefore, for thousands of years, although they read the classics enthusiastically, they were all distorting and conjecturing in a state of half-understanding. It was not until the Qing Dynasty that the method of studying classics went on the road of textual research; this is the so-called methods of "exegesis," "substance and emptiness," and "analogy." After three hundred years of effort, research on classics has made some progress. However, by the time of the Qing Dynasty, the classical scholar Wang Guowei frankly told us that he did not understand one or two tenths of the Book of Poetry, and four or five tenths of the Book of Documents. Chuan Si-nian also said: "Even in the hands of experts, the Six Classics are only half-understood." Recently, with the help of grammar and the reference of bronze inscriptions and oracle bone inscriptions, the study of classics has embarked on the road of scientific organization. Although there have been many new advances and new classical scholars have made many new contributions, there are still many areas that are not understood. Indeed, in fact, it is not only the difficulty in reading and understanding the classics, but also the so-called ancient prose in general. If we raise the standard of reading, it is not something that ordinary people who "read poetry and books superficially" can understand.</p>
<p>However, bizarre facts are commonly appearing in current primary and secondary education. This kind of fact is spreading widely. Let's put aside the error of whether primary and secondary school students can accept the content of classics and ancient prose in terms of thought and intelligence, and talk about it from the fundamental issue. Those wise teachers (?) themselves only half-understand classics and ancient prose, and they don't even know what phonology, writing, exegesis, and textual research are; what enlightening method can they use to interpret ancient prose and classics? To make primary school students understand? I will now show some "words" and "characters" from "Reply to Li Meisheng's Letter" to teachers who have no knowledge of phonology, writing, and exegesis, and let them honestly estimate whether they are qualified to teach and explain classics, history, and ancient prose.</p>
<p>Example 1: "One spring morning and evening, autumn moon." — See Han Shu.</p>
<p>(Note) "Morning" in "morning sun" and "evening" in "evening moon" should be interpreted as sacrifices.</p>
<p>Example 2: "Entering its gate, there is no one guarding the gate; entering its boudoir, there is no one guarding the boudoir." — See Gongyang Zhuan.</p>
<p>(Note) "Gate" in "no one guarding the gate" and "boudoir" in "no one guarding the boudoir" should be interpreted as guards.</p>
<p>Example 3: "Step has a new dock." — See Han Yu's writings.</p>
<p>(Note) "Step" is the same as "dock." (Loan character.)</p>
<p>Example 4: "High gate hangs thin curtains." — See Zhuangzi.</p>
<p>(Note) "Thin" is interpreted as "curtain." (Loan meaning.)</p>
<p>Example 5: "Do not harbor resentment." — See [omitted].</p>
<p>(Note) "Harbor" is interpreted as "retain." (Extended meaning.)</p>
<p>Example 6: "Already has excessive power." — See Book of Poetry.</p>
<p>(Note) "Excessive" is interpreted as "great."</p>
<p>Example 7: "Party." — See Shuowen Jiezi.</p>
<p>(Note) Not clear. (Pictographic) Example 8: "The four stallions are very large." — See Erya.</p>
<p>Example 9: "Road gate." — See Erya.</p>
<p>(Note) "Road" and "large" are both interpreted as "great." (Extended meaning).</p>
<p>These explanations are not even considered satisfactory by new classical scholars. It is known how difficult it is to read classics, history, and ancient prose. Hu Shi said: "Today, it is ignorant to talk about reading classics and ancient prose, or reading classics and ancient prose in primary and secondary schools. It is not worth a learned person's smile." This is very pertinent. Now, I hope that wise teachers will quickly put down those flashy classics, history, and ancient prose, and give primary and secondary school students some substantial and useful knowledge!</p>
<h3>Bombing of a Mountain City — War Zone Diary —</h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>Due to the setbacks in the offensive on the Henan-Hubei routes, the Liuan line was also stopped at Yeji and could not move. The only way out was to vent their anger by indiscriminately bombing. Just like the "heroes" in the martial arts world, before returning empty-handed, they must take a dump somewhere to show that the "hero" is still "extraordinary." Moreover, before destruction, the formula will not be overturned. They always conduct reconnaissance first and distribute leaflets. The subtle and clever words, matched with colorful paper, show their extravagance despite tightening their belts.</p>
<p>The mountain city, with a population of less than 20,000, does not need to evacuate the population, it was already emptied long ago. On the day of destruction, the first three planes, bang bang bang—and then the county town within five miles around was immersed in a brownish-gray smoke, spewing out the strong smell of sulfur; the universe was silent. Only the roar of the rocks after being hit by bombs seemed to say, get out of here, you weaklings!</p>
<p>The first three planes returned dejectedly, and another three appeared in the sky, which is said to be called "wheel bombing"; and half an hour later, another three came, and the sound of stones and bombs fighting lasted until noon. The "wheel bombing" finally ended, and the flames in the southwest half of the city indeed soared into the sky.</p>
<p>"Incendiary bombs! Damn it!…"</p>
<p>The fire continued to burn until evening, and it still did not recede. The area near the county government outside the East Gate became a scorched earth. Many collapsed houses were emitting white smoke. At the entrance of the airplane cave at the foot of the mountain, there were five or six headless and broken-armed corpses, naturally victims who could not escape; but besides this, no one was injured, and everyone was the same as usual. The only difference was that a deep impression of destruction was left in everyone's mind, teaching you to thoroughly recognize the face of the "hero."</p>
<p>The mountain city seems to be destroyed, but the Dabie Mountains will always exist stubbornly. The towering peaks are like countless iron fists stretched out by warriors, as if holding up the clear blue sky. No, it is preparing to shoot down the setting sun. When the rescue team returned from the eastern suburbs, a magnificent song suddenly came: Mountain city, bombed mountain city! Don't bow your head and sigh, or moan softly! Caress the new wounds—re-explore the path to light! Create your new life in the sparks! Mountain city, sharpen your sharp teeth, remove the miasma, swallow the dark clouds, and restore the eternal tranquility of the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<h3>Leap</h3>
<p>— Ke Meng</p>
<p>Fallen leaves whirled and flew rustling; like snow, like butterflies.</p>
<p>Groans circled the roof, shivering. The walls, the table, the bed, the floor, in a word, all the furnishings in the room seemed to be crying, silent and gray. Let the lonely coughs hit them and bounce back.</p>
<p>"Feeling better?" I couldn't help but walk closer to the bedside and hold his hot hand tightly.</p>
<p>Coughs took turns answering, the bed, the person, and the room all groaned, as if enduring a suffering, a suffering that would burst the world.</p>
<p>Dusk hung outside the window, the wind hissed, but could not blow away the groans in the room.</p>
<p>Thirsty? Do you want some boiled water?</p>
<p>In the hazy light, he shook his head.</p>
<p>I stared at the gradually sinking eyes, ah, those eyes, those eyes, still flashing with stubborn light.</p>
<p>"Why are you looking at me like that?" A bitter smile flashed across his pale lips: "I'm not sick. I know what era I'm living in, what environment I'm in. I carry a healthy body and mind, running from south to north, from north to south... enduring all hardships, trying to liberate myself and some other oppressed people from a榨子 (a type of press), but accidental 'misfortune' drove me to this dead port. It took away my vitality. Cough—cough—…"</p>
<p>I stood there dumbfounded, unable to say a word of comfort.</p>
<p>"But I have to live, I have to live, I have to live!" His face turned redder, roaring, angry, as if an invisible magic power was lurking beside him that would devour his life at any time: "I have to live! I have recognized those demons who are doing cannibalism there, brewing germs there! … Everyone rise up and destroy them, tear them off from the body of the world!"</p>
<p>The light became brighter than before. It was quiet for a moment.</p>
<p>I stared again at the sleeping face after excessive excitement, it was slightly sweating—that sweat fully expressed his joy and satisfaction. "Oh, yes, he is not sick."</p>
<p>Darkness threw fallen leaves on the window lattice, making a rustling groan.</p>
<p>Sweat was flashing after the groans.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, the world is sick, we have to tear off all the bad flesh from his body!"</p>

<h3>The Eagle and the Sparrowhawk</h3>
<p>— Original by Henryk Sienkiewicz of Poland, translated by Ming</p>
<p>The eagle, near the sparrowhawk's nest, said to the sparrowhawk, "Listen to me, in my power!" "What do you want?" the sparrowhawk asked.</p>
<p>"I want to kill you and eat your meat." "Why do you want to kill me?"</p>
<p>"What a stupid thing! And I see that your news is not well-informed. My nest is too small, so I want your nest; that way my sons will have room to grow. Besides, I have my eagle policy, but you are speaking another language, and you do not obey my will."</p>
<p>"I speak the language that nature has given me. Can you tell me why I should obey your will?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, but I know that I have the right to kill anything that does not obey my will."</p>
<p>"So, I have no hope of being spared?" "I don't think so. But if you are prepared to sacrifice yourself, that is a great honor for you."</p>
<p>"Please tell me, my friend, where did you learn this way of thinking?"</p>
<p>"Hey, you stupid thing," the eagle replied, "don't you know that I studied in the Berlin Zoo for two years?"</p>

<h3>Samuel Goldwyn Selects Twelve Great Stars</h3>
<p>— Mu Tao</p>
<p>The production giant Samuel Goldwyn has selected twelve stars based on many years of experience, believing them to be the greatest movie stars in his mind, and has briefly explained each one. The rankings are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Charlie Chaplin Undeniably stands in the leading position of Hollywood stars. He is the greatest comedian and is not eliminated by time, and his reputation is still strong. His performance is more in the heart than in wit, and when we see him perform and laugh, tears often follow behind.</p>
<p>(2) Douglas Fairbanks The role he plays is the opposite of Chaplin. He has the spirit of American struggle. He represents the American imagination, and America made him an idol.</p>
<p>(3) Norma Shearer For the same reason, her name will last forever. She is the ideal woman, with outward beauty, spiritual courage, and mental brilliance. For more than ten years, she has not been affected by time and has become more popular.</p>
<p>(4) Mary Pickford This "American sweetheart" cannot but be included as one of the greatest stars. She enjoyed fame on the screen the earliest. Although she does not act now, there are still millions of fans who remember her.</p>
<p>(5) Marguerite Clark She is Mary Pickford's only opponent. His performance is almost identical to Mary's, the biggest difference is that she is a bit more frivolous than [Mary].</p>
<p>(6) Janet Gaynor She has the characteristics of Mary and Marguerite, petite and exquisite. The difference is that her performance is more gentle than deeply felt.</p>
<p>(7) Greta Garbo The first mysterious woman on the screen. Her natural ability made her a great actress, and her temperament made her a great star.</p>
<p>(8) Clara Bow She was born of love. She is exactly opposite to Greta Garbo</p>
<p>(9) Warner Baxter His selection as a great star is different from others. He is a representative of youth and strength. The audience loves him because he performs youthful movements.</p>
<p>(10) Will Rogers His greatness is due to his honest and sincere attitude in portraying the general people of America.</p>
<p>(11) Wallace Beery Because he represents an ordinary person who speaks rudely and vulgarly, people hope that he will appear on the screen so that they can recognize themselves.</p>
<p>(12) Eddie Cantor Besides Chaplin, he is the greatest comedian</p>
<p>Goldwyn believes that since the advent of film, there have been many great movie stars, such as Valentino and Gloria Swanson. But in his opinion, there are only the above twelve greatest movie stars.</p>
<h3>"West Wind Drama Society" and "Empress Dowager"</h3>
<p>Historical stories are more commonly used as drama materials in the current environment. Some speculative theater groups are producing them crudely. Although these things that are "privately engaged in the back garden" are completely contrary to the times, they can shock a generation of petty citizens. However, it is ultimately a trick and a speculative act, and we absolutely cannot condone them.</p>
<p>Perhaps we will not forget that in November of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), the "Forties Drama Troupe" in Shanghai gave a honorary performance of Mr. Xia Yan's play "Sai Jinhua"! Its performance swept away the group of ugliness like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The theatrical movement in Shanghai after the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle was even more prosperous than before; this is not speculation, it is indeed adapting to the needs of the times; at least it can be said: "The isolated island is not isolated"! The "Forties" ended due to various reasons, which is such a pity, but there are not a few successors; recently, Yue Feng contacted many outstanding figures in the drama, film, and education circles, and organized a "West Wind Drama Society", preparing to perform "Empress Dowager" in a short time.</p>
<p>Comparing "Empress Dowager" and "Sai Jinhua", it is of course felt that the former has more value for performance than the latter, because Sai Jinhua is only a famous prostitute in the late Qing Dynasty. Although her beauty is famous, her relationship with history and politics is still superficial. She only persuaded the commander of the Allied Forces, the German Waldersee, with justice and beauty during the Eight-Nation Alliance, so that the people in the Pingjin area suffered less from the disaster of war: As for the Empress Dowager, she is simply a great woman of a generation in the four thousand years of China. Apart from Wu Zetian, no one can compete with her. However, when Wu ruled, our country was still a closed country, and everything was of course easier to deal with, but in the more than sixty years of the Empress Dowager's rule, it was a time when foreign enemies and internal troubles were intertwined. She relied on her unique political talent and extraordinary skills to deal with the situation. The hardships she went through were tens of thousands of times more difficult than Sai Jinhua; in her life's work, there are indeed many materials that can be used for our reference, whether she is successful or unsuccessful.</p>
<p>This rising drama troupe, the "West Wind Drama Society", adopted such a story for its first performance. It will cause a sensation when it is performed in the future.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to it.</p>

<h3>A Week's Essays</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>(53)</p>
<p>As the saying goes: Peaches and plums do not speak, yet a path forms beneath them. Path means path. It means that peaches and plums, because of their blossoms and fruits, do not need to call out, but people compete to go there, coming and going without end, and a path naturally forms beneath them. Red dancers are also the peaches and plums of the dance hall, so dance halls compete to recruit red stars, which is also to seek prosperity and flourishing business. Hu Yanyan of Dahua initially had no reputation, but her beauty was outstanding among her peers. In recent months, she has become good at dressing up, and her dancing skills have also improved, and she has also learned to socialize a little, so her name has become very popular. Major dance halls are competing to hire her, but Hu's mother believes that Dahua is her birthplace and does not want to forget her roots, so she still has no intention of climbing to higher branches. However, if there are other reasons in the future to leave Dahua, she will definitely move to the metropolis, because of A Feng and A Kang's firm invitation, and although Hu's mother and daughter are villagers, they know how to value their promises.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend invited me to a banquet at Feda, where I met Mi Ling, a poet formerly of Daxin, who gave me a silly smile. The person sitting with him seemed to be his [blank], the two of them were talking intimately, looking quite harmonious. I only hope that their flowers will always be beautiful and the moon will always be round.</p>
<p>I happened to be with a star from Paramount at Xianle, passing by Mattehust Road, and saw an advertisement for Sanyou Pills, which said: The way of husband and wife is very mysterious. If you do it well, you will smile. The star asked: What is so mysterious between husband and wife? How can you do it well? I was speechless. My friend said: You'll know when you marry a husband.</p>

<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two Silly Young Masters in the Peking Amateur Opera World</p>
<p>Who knew that his housekeeper colluded with the buyer, and wrote some slippery and clever words on the sales contract without him knowing. On the surface, it said that the house was purchased for 100,000 yuan, but who would have thought that after the silver was handed over, Tang suddenly sent a large number of military police to drive out the entire family of the Rong family, old and young, servants, and maids. Except for the clothes they were wearing, all the furniture and antiques were not allowed to be moved out. This scared the fourth master Rong silly. When he looked for the housekeeper again, he had already run away. With great difficulty, he asked someone to talk to the Tang family, and they replied: "Who would spend 100,000 yuan to buy your broken bricks (meaning empty houses)? It was made clear from the beginning that it included the furniture." At that time, Tang was very powerful, and the contract was not clear. Even if he filed a lawsuit, he would not necessarily win. So later, he still asked someone to plead with reason, and only managed to take out some of the antiques and treasures. As for those fine wooden furniture such as patterned sandalwood and rosewood, not a single piece was taken out. Rong Jun suffered this dumb loss and was even more ashamed to show his face, so I never saw him again during my years in Peking, but his name as a silly person was very prominent.</p>
<p>In addition to the fourth master Rong, there is also a fourth master Zhong, who is also around fifty years old. He has always had the nickname of a silly young master. His father used to be the governor of Sichuan. During the late Qing Dynasty, there was no position more noble than the governor-general of Sichuan. It was an excellent and lucrative position. After one term, he could earn a lot of money, and he also bought a large mansion in the old capital. After his father passed away, he was in complete control of this family fortune. Zhong Si also loves drama very much. His two favorite famous actors in his life are Old Tan and Xiao Lou. When Old Tan was alive, as long as there was a play, he would go with Yan San (Ju Peng) to listen. The two of them became friends from listening to operas. Sometimes Old Tan sang in the city and it was late, so Ju Peng would stay at the Zhong residence. If there was a play outside the city, Zhong Si would stay at Yan San's house. (154)</p>
