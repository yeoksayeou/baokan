<p>社評</p>
<h3>巴爾幹局勢與蘇義對立</h3>
<p>在歐洲五强間，唯一置身局外尚未直接參戰的義大利會不會捲人漩渦？在歐陸範圍內，唯一倖免火藥氣味的東南角，會不會再度糜爛？這兩個答案都須求之於巴爾幹局勢的發展。在世界任何角落裏，國際關係的錯綜複雜，縱橫捭闔，要算巴爾幹半島首屈一指了。這種複雜局面的搆成，具有「內涵的」與「外在的」兩種原素。「內涵的」原素在於經濟與民族，「外在的」原素則有操縱着巴爾幹命運的歐洲列强。這兩種原素又互爲因果，要了解巴爾幹的局勢，非同時顧及不可。</p>
<p>巴爾幹的整個社會經濟組織，直到現在，在縱的方面，還沒有脫離在貴族地主控制下的半封建狀態；在橫的方面，依然是向德義英法供給原料糧食的半殖民地，而對於德國的經濟關係尤其密切。多數民衆的生活異常艱苦；於是納粹主義與共產主義都得乘隙而入，醞釀着國際性質的社會經濟改革運動。</p>
<p>巴爾幹半島各國間，又有極複雜的民族問題；而所謂「大日耳曼主義」與「大斯拉夫主義」郤正借重這個「少數民族」的幌子，大吹大擂，有所圖謀。希特勒說，他的「同胞弟兄」分散在匈南羅蘇四國者不下三百五十萬人。史丹林說，保南二國的大多數人民皆我同種，僅在羅馬尼亞的比薩拉比亞省即有二十萬人。德國的侵佔奧捷，德蘇的瓜分波蘭，雖超過了民族的分野，但最初無不以民族的論據爲引綫。以巴爾幹民族的複雜，欺凌弱小，幾無時無地不可利用這種藉口爲進攻的理由。</p>
<p>至於最近巴爾幹的國際背景，試以德國做中心而加以分析：（一）德國與巴爾幹的關係，以經濟爲重心。原來德國所必需輸入的糧食與原料，除巴爾幹所不出產的羊毛·棉花·橡皮·咖啡等外，恰有半數仰給於巴爾幹。在此大戰進行期間，英法加緊對德封鎖，其倚賴的程度自更加深一層。此外，德國又視多瑙河流域爲直指近東與中束的捷徑，威脅各該方面英法勢力的孔道。（二）俄國因爲資源豐富，無論在沙皇時代或蘇維埃治下，對於巴爾幹的經濟關係並不密切；但她始終以斯拉夫民族的盟主自居，在十九世紀與二十世紀初，曾助其東南歐的「同胞」脫離阿託曼帝國的覊絆，即在今日，亦因民族的淵源，爲彼吸引保南等國的農工階級的敲門磚。在大體上看來，德蘇二國在巴爾幹，縱有民族主義上的衝突，確未至「短兵相接」的階段。尤其是從二國締結不侵條的後，德國與英法作戰於西疆，不能不竭力與蘇聯歡；影響所及，且使參加「防共協定」的匈牙利政府，二十年來一向反蘇的南斯拉夫政府與保加利亞政府，亦不得不對於蘇聯掩旗息鼓。（三）蘇德接近與蘇聯在歐陸的拾頭，無形中使另一「軸心」國義大利大感威脅。一墨索里尼之參加一軸心」，原有代價：就是德國支持他向巴爾幹的發展；而他所以重視巴爾幹的理由，則第一在經濟方面藉巴爾幹爲糧食原料的供給地，第二在軍略方面：（甲）保護亞得里亞海岸及其東非殖民地，（乙）自佔領阿爾巴尼亞後，視南斯拉夫與希臘爲其勢力範圍。義蘇邦交向稱惡劣，今墨索里尼目覩其勢力範圍隨時有磕破之虞，當然爲之寢饋難安。</p>
<p>去今一個月前，羅馬的廣播電台及墨氏機關報曾一再聲明：「義國不允許鮑爾雪維克的蘇聯，越過喀爾巴阡山而入多瑙河流域或巴爾幹，進窺地中海！」「共產黨希望擴張其勢力於巴爾幹，則勢必與墨索里尼主義與義國軍隊衝突！」如此表示，決非「虛聲恫嚇」；而爲劍及屨及的神情：據法國方面所得情報。</p>
<p>巴黎二十一日電：『據此間今日所得消息，本月一日，義大利曾決定將其「北部軍」動員，並與南斯拉夫商妥，借道該國開入匈牙利，以阻止蘇聯在該方面之活動。再如蘇聯向羅馬尼亞採取攻勢，義大利準備爲羅國援助，因其工業听亟需之煤油實山羅國供給也。……德國於本月初聞義大利動員情報及軍事計劃後，乃急向義保證，謂蘇聯不至發動於東南歐，蓋義大利態度堅決，而紅軍對芬蘭戰事又受挫折，莫斯科對於巴爾幹之態度不能不大受影響云』</p>
<p>可見義蘇對立的尖銳，幾乎與日俱進；而方挾義蘇以自重的德國，自不願見其尖銳至於行動化；蓋一則恐義蘇兩敗俱傷，削弱德國的聲勢，再則義大利倘與蘇聯決鬥，勢必聯絡土耳其，羅馬尼亞與希臘；這三國倘與義國相結合，則正面雖爲對付蘇聯，而其側面則爲接近英法，亦即與德國當然變爲對立。德國急於爲義蘇調停，苦衷在此。在十一月中旬，羅馬尼亞發起擴大羅南希土的巴爾幹協商，搆成一巴爾幹中立集團，現在義國雖聲明，認爲無此必要，但當初蛛絲馬跡，顯見義大利積極活動，力促其成；此無他，要在阻遏蘇聯勢力的膨脹。關於此事，英法輿諭界認爲「此項集團倘能成立，在英法兩國言之，縱非直接的外交勝利，至少亦爲極大的收穫」，而德國則徇蘇聯之請，從中阻撓。但是義蘇對立的因素，無法消弭。蘇聯今方與芬蘭作戰，戰事結束後，是否將用武力向羅馬尼亞淸算比薩拉比亞的舊賬，義大利是否將以防止蘇聯而向南斯拉夫與匈牙利進兵，自皆無從預測，將來如竟見諸行動，則歐戰自必入於更廣泛的堦段。</p>

<p>東京　關於昨日美大使格魯與日外相野村會晤之消息、日方所傳消息互相抵觸、據日本新聞社之報告、格魯曾語野村、謂美國對日本之開放長江、甚爲「欣悅」、美國將報以「友誼行動」、美政府將利用此時機、使美日貿易關係得以繼續、但據「朝日新聞」所載、則謂格魯對野村所詢問之美國對美日貿易關係將取何種態度之問題、未予以直接答覆（二十三日合衆社）</p>
<p>東京　據此間權威方面聲稱、美大使格魯咋曾予日外相野村以保證、謂美國於下月中美日商約取消後、仍將維持美日貿易關係、但並未談及具體行動或辦法格魯之言詞係答野村之詢問面發、野村曾要求格魯、於耶誕節前、略爲表明美國對此事件之態度、日人此舉、係欲在國會開幕前、獲得保證、於新年假前、予日本商界一種保證云、格魯當時拒絕對野村氏之訊問、以直接其體答復、日本報界今日對此格魯野村之談話、咸以極樂觀之論調登載、股票證券市塲皆飛漲、消息靈通方面咸信、此次談話已爲美日正式會議闢一途徑、一切障碍皆已掃除、日人於此次對美談話中、利用美人一種對於耶誕節之心理、時時提及耶誕之精神等、一九三七年日本解決對美艦「潘南」號賠款之事、亦係利用此時季云（二十三日合衆電）</p>

<p>重慶　此間華方人十對於今晨在東京開幕之日本本届議會、均予以甚大之注意、各著名華字報紙、今日對之多著論評述、中央日報載稱、日本議會目前之重大問題、即爲如何調整日美及日蘇之關係、因日美商約一個月後即將滿期、日本已宣布在兩月期內開放長江、以期誘使美國續訂新約、惟據該報之意見、日本企圖調整其對美蘇關係之舉、定遭失敗、預料本届議會之前途、殊爲黑暗云、中國陸軍喉舌掃蕩報、亦評論此事云、阿部首相雖努力謀取政黨及新聞界之援助、但其內閣似難延續、該報末稱、日本之困難、現已達到不能解决之境地、故阿部內閣將告失敗、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　此間今日各晚報多揭載日本議會之開會情形、及紐約所傳美國不致對日實施懲戒關稅之辦法、又此間對於美日關係已存樂觀、惟國民新聞則稱、日本開放長江實屬得不償失、假若日本此舉猶不能獲得確切之貿易條的關係、則日本必將大失所望矣、（二十三日合衆電）</p>
<h3>日本在法　外交活動</h3>
<p>巴黎　此間法方今日對於十年來法日間懸而未決之「日本金借款」問題之解決、極爲歡欣、認爲法日調整關係之朕兆、據新任日本駐法大使澤田稱、關於償還一九一二年日本所借五釐法債之問題、業已與法方成立協定、此外法日間待解決之問題、即由滇越路輸送軍火至中國之問題、惟據法方稱、法方並未容許軍火由安南輸入中國之行動、外間所傳、無非德國宣傳部所造之謠、意圖惡化法日關係、以便蘇日關係之接近云、又此間一般人士認美蘇關係之變化影響極大、蓋美國若與蘇聯斷絕邦交、則大有助於英法對於蘇德之地位也、（二十三日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>美國建造　大艦計畫　英國專家觀察　認為不易實現</h3>
<p>倫敦英國海軍專家視美國衆議院海軍小組委員會誚海軍部提出建造六萬五千噸大戰艦預算之消息、爲不易實現之事英國海軍界之反響爲「以全力添造新艦、但爲較小者而非較大者、」據要津方面云、此次戰事、已證明較小的戰艦之需要雖不贊成建造四萬噸以上之戰艦、但亦指陳德國袖珍式戰艦之種種缺點、其最大者爲砲位過重、不與其排水量相適稱、德國海軍建築師作長期之試騐而在一定排水量中安置更多砲位、超過實際上可能、其實此種試騐、終未證明成功、且一艦而有三四個以上之砲塔未免錯誤、此乃觀於「斯比」號全副裝置、竟爲砲彈一枚所擊毀一事而可見者、舍此而外、六萬五千噸戰艦之造費亦未免過鉅、英國造艦之佔計成本爲每噸二百十九鎊、而在美國則造價約及四百鎊、美國造八萬噸戰艦一艘所費當爲三千二百萬鎊、美國未必由四萬噸戰艦一躍而造六萬五千噸或八萬噸戰艦、美人當未忘却巴拿馬運河、當英戰艦「納爾遜」號經過巴拿馬運河時、河岸距艦僅十八吋、費極大之困難始獲通過、故美國建造六萬五千噸或八萬噸戰艦之說、無足重視也（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>德與南美各國　換貨協定　因戰事無法履行　經濟上重大打擊</h3>
<p>阿根廷　本年三月間德國與阿根廷所訂之物物交換協定、現已受戰事影響而無法履行、按照此項協定、德國須供給阿根廷「狄塞爾」引擎火車頭六十四輛、貨車九百輛、睡車四十輛、及運油車若干輛、至於阿根廷方面則應提交德國大麥十萬噸·羊毛八千噸·以及其他各種物產、雙方交換之物價總額爲三·六四〇·〇〇〇美金、阿根廷已交之貨已達協定之半數、大麥十萬噸亦已於戰事爆發前運交德國、但德國方面交與阿根廷之貨如鐵路車輛則僅佔一部、其餘部份德允於一九四〇年及一九四一年中提交、但自從戰事爆發之後、德國之商船隊已絕跡於海上、故其所允提交之貨物迄無抵達此間者、德國駐阿根廷大使戴爾曼雖向阿根廷政府表示、德國決定謀協定之履行、但此間對此之希望則已極少、因此鐵道部現已決定改向他國定購車輛、據鐵道部稱、運油車二百輛則已改向美國定購、價値爲五十萬美金、又流綫型「狄塞爾」引擎火車十列車每列三節、及「狄塞爾」摩托車七輛則改向匈牙利定購、據此間關係方面指稱、即使德國願意履行合同、事實上亦多困難、蓋德國旣經英法封鎖之後、外界之貨旣已不能抵達德國、德國之貨物亦已不能輸出也、聞南美其他各國與德國簽訂之物物交換協定、亦已同樣發生停頓、（廿三日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>蘇軍冒嚴寒反攻　克復北部重要城鎭　蘇孤军深入獲一敎訓　孟納興上將戰略奏功</h3>
<p>荷京　據芬京可靠消息、蘇聯軍隊在芬蘭國北部前線敗退、此訉已經瑞典挪威兩國人士予以證實、緣紅軍先頭部隊開抵霍亨傑維城鎭、其主力部隊尚未到達薩爾米傑維鎭、以致孤軍深入、實力單薄、不能維持後方交通綫、其時芬蘭軍隊業已獲有補充、當即大舉反攻、經二日夜之激戰、紅軍終於不支、乃向比加傑維與薩爾米傑維吶城敗退、秩序紊亂、還棄大批軍用品，倘若賡續後退、將以貝柴摩港爲歸宿、據最後消息、比加傑維城亦已被芬蘭軍克復、芬蘭陸軍滑雪隊、迭次予紅軍以重創、（一十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>丹京　據昨夜此間所得消息、芬蘭極北處之蘇軍仍在退撤中、芬軍刻正以審愼之動作、加强其進攻、該區域之蘇軍、初以有秩序之方式向後退却、但未幾則沿途委棄軍械、倉皇亂竄、昨夜巳與其星期三日所佔之陣地相隔二十至三十公里、彼等顯欲退至茂曼斯克鐵路上之柯拉鎭、而非折回其登陸處之貝柴摩口岸、芬軍總司令孟納興上將所採之戰略現漸告成功、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>芬京　昨日東北部兩前綫芬軍乘勝進擊、蘇軍繼續敗退、據挪威邊境來訊、貝柴摩走廊中之紅軍刻正迅速退却、該區途中棄有在酷寒中冰凍之坦克車與軍械頗夥、衆信　兵死於嚴寒者較戰死者爲多、北部蘇軍將否決計在冬令作戰乎、抑將暫停活動、以待天氣轉佳時始行進攻乎、此間人士對之紛加揣測、據負責方面聲稱、芬軍在薩拉前綫反攻、乃「決定戰局前途之勝利」、（廿三日路透）</p>
<p>倫敦　「每日快報」駐荷京城訪員頃來電稱、據可靠消息、蘇聯軍事當局業已决定停止攻擊芬蘭、一俟明春、再行採取攻勢、各中立國軍事專家之駐在芬蘭國者則謂、紅軍卽當在佔領地內掘壕固守、待至明春天氣晴和時、再行進攻云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯承認　對芬作戰困難</h3>
<p>孟納興防綫堪與齊格斐綫媲美　地勢崎嶇湖沼密佈成天然保障　謂蘇軍戰績視英法已較勝一籌</p>
<p>莫斯科　關於過去三星期之蘇芬戰事情况、列寗格勒軍區總部頃發表公報如下、「總計過去三星期中之戰况、吾人應承認蘇聯軍隊已獲得重要的勝利、（一）在芬蘭北部、蘇軍自十二月一日佔領貝柴摩港口後、更深入芬蘭內地一百三十公里、若自貝倫芝海岸起計算、蘇聯軍隊每日進展六公里、（二）在烏里堡方面、蘇聯軍隊已前進一百五十公里、平均每日進展七公里半、在樊堡格綫上、紅軍已自本國邊界前進六十四公里、平均每日進展三·二公里、（三）在西道堡爾方面、蘇聯軍隊已前進八十公里、平均每日進展四公里、</p>
<p>總計在各陣綫上、蘇聯軍隊擒獲芬蘭軍官十八人、下級軍官一〇五人、兵士一千三百零二人、同時並獲得大批戰利品、計大砲三十五鬥、機槍三百架、步槍三千枝、迫擊砲一十一門、手溜彈射器二百二十具及裝中車七輛、蘇聯方面計陣亡者一千八百二十三人、傷者七千人、至於芬蘭方面、即在蘇聯軍隊已佔領各地已尋獲屍身二千二百具、至於被蘇聯砲火擊斃者尚不在其內、據總部統計、芬方傷者的有萬人，</p>
<p>芬蘭之地勢、事實上對於我軍之進行極爲困難、公路之缺乏、地勢之崎嶇、森林湖澤之多、以及堅固之大砲及機關槍陣地、均爲阻止蘇聯紅軍迅速前進之障礙、</p>
<p>芬蘭建築此項工事已有四年、得助於三個外國、而該三國係企圖在芬蘭增厚勢力、藉以作進攻列寗格勒及莫斯科之根據地、就抵抗力量而言、此項人造工事（例如在喀萊里亞地頸方面）副以天然保障、其堅强程度並不下於西綫之齊格斐陣地、英法在齊格斐綫作戰四個月、絲毫無進展、</p>
<p>此種困難紅軍極爲明瞭、故絕未預料以驚人打擊、消滅芬軍、若以未能在一星期內消滅芬軍歸咎紅軍領袖、顯係毫無知識、或係故意誹謗蘇聯軍隊、喀萊里亞地頸、係最難於攻克之區、該處之防務自羅的加湖至近樊堡之芬蘭灣一帶、築有極堅强之工事、但蘇聯軍隊在該方面、每日仍前進三·二公里、同時芬蘭之主要陣綫「孟納興綫」、已被蘇聯軍隊衝破、</p>
<p>苟吾人以紅軍在孟納興綫進展程度、與英法軍隊在齊格斐綫進展相較、則吾人必須承認蘇聯軍隊已獲得重要成功、而英法軍隊則已完全失敗、</p>
<p>英法軍隊在齊格斐綫企圖擊淡德軍、在過去四個月中之進展程度如何、外國報紙何以不予以注意、豈非英法軍隊進展路程太短、而不能以公里或公尺估計而必須以公分計算乎、（二十三日塔斯社電）</p>
<h3>芬軍戰報</h3>
<p>芬京　總司令部發表戰報稱、（一）喀萊里亞地峽方面蘇聯軍隊、仍以高克傑維與繆奧拉傑維兩城爲目標、曾在砲火掩護下、竟日向我軍陣地進攻、並由坦克車及飛機助戰、但均被我軍擊退、（二）台貝勒河一帶紅軍、企圖衝破我方陣地、幷未得逞、且損失綦重、共爲我軍擊毀坦克車七輛、（三）東綫方面、紅軍向維德拉鎭進攻、當即被我軍所擊退、雙方軍隊並在阿格拉傑維城發生爭奪戰、頗爲劇烈、（四）在里夫薩與賴波拉兩處之間、僅發生小規模之遭遇戰、紅軍損失坦克車一輛、（五）北部薩拉城方面、我軍反攻頗爲得手、擊毀蘇聯坦克車十輛、（六）貝柴摩港方面、雙方部隊迄在鏖戰中、貝柴摩鎳礦區內聞曾發生劇烈爆炸、殆係紅軍撤退時所爲、（七）蘇聯飛機本日仍極活躍、曾於大雪紛飛中、飛至我國京城轟炸、共投彈十五枚、均未中的、我方並無死傷、敵機曾被吾方擊落十一架、另有五架則已被迫降落、芬蘭飛機亦極活動、時與敵機作戰、並會飛往蘇聯列寗區域散發傳單、將蘇芬兩國戰爭之內幕告知蘇聯人民、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>「十月革命」號　被擊沉說　蘇聯聲明否認</h3>
<p>莫期科　據路透及哈瓦期報告、蘇聯巨型艦「十月革命」號已陂芬蘭砲隊擊沉、蘇聯波羅的海總部巳加以否認、並聲明此種報道、係極荒謬之僞造消息、（二十三日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>英法兩國準備　切實援助芬蘭　對丹瑞挪所處地位　尤不可不加以顧慮</h3>
<p>巴黎　內閣今晨舉行國務會議、理當即就外交軍事局勢提出報告、幷謂芬蘭軍隊抵抗蘇聯之侵略、業已獲有重大勝利、蘇聯軍已在若干處地方潰敗、關係各國現均凖備援助芬蘭云、各閣員聆悉之餘、均表示滿意（廿三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法總理達拉第昨夜在衆院歡呼聲中、言及芬蘭對蘇抗戰事、謂僅僅稱讚芬蘭人之忠勇、於事無補、吾人必有以助之、國聯會目初即已譴責蘇聯、而吾人已以一心一德之形式、行使吾人全部之職責、今後吾人將繼續爲之云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　關於援助芬蘭抗戰一項問題、此間外交界人士預料、英法兩國當在今後數日內、與斯坎的那維亞半島各國積極交換意見、蓋阻遏蘇聯軍隊深入芬蘭領土、此於央法兩國以及整個歐洲、均屬極端重要故也、據斯坎的那維亞半島各國傳來可靠消息、各該國對於援助芬蘭一層、確皆具有誠意、惟是問題並不簡單、質言之、各該國倘公開儘量接濟芬蘭、則其本身之實力不免隨之削弱、結果所屆、自必更易爲德蘇兩國所覬覦、職是之故、各該國目下所急欲諗知者、厥爲各該國他日倘若被德義兩國所侵略、是否亦能獲有充分援助克謀自保、此種顧慮、英法認爲具有充分理由、爰於一面儘量援助芬蘭之外、同時更就如何維護斯坎的那維亞半島各國一項問題悉心硏討、總之英法兩國政府即當責成各專家調査在軍略上實際上所可給予芬蘭之援助、務使此項援助能以發揮實效、然後再依據此項調査結果、與斯坎的那維亞半島各國進行談判、（二十二日哈瓦期電）</p>

<p>倫敦　路透社海軍訪員稱、保護英國漁船隊之計畫、刻正準備、大約不久將付實行、其性質現尚未披露、現爲籌備必要佈置之極好時機、蓋英國漁船向來留泊港中過聖誕節、而蘇格蘭漁船則在新歲休假也、此間認德方之攻擊英漁船、其主要動機在報復德袖珍戰艦斯比號之喪失、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>本屆大學　統一招生考試概况（十二）</h3>
<p>又如</p>
<p>周生總分三百二十、第一志願中央大學經濟系、第二志願西南聯大政治系、第三志願中央大學敎育系、</p>
<p>王生總分三百、第一志願中央大學經濟系、第二志願中央大學敎育系、第三志願浙江大學史地系、</p>
<p>周生總分較王生高、但其第二志願均以額滿不能分發、王生成績不如周生、其第一志願當亦額滿見遺、但其第二志願中大敎育系、則以志願人數不多而被分入、俟周生以第三志願分發時、則該系名額已滿、不能再分、故結果周生分數雖高、不能分入中大敎育系、而王生分數較低、反可分入中大敎育系、從這兩個例子看來、要達到志願學校或學系的目的、第一分數要高、第二同一志願的不可過多、如分數不高、而同一志願的過多時、欲求達到其志願、那就很難了、錄取是根據一個標準、分發是拿許多人來比較以定標準、換一句話說、是比較的標準、而不是絕對的標準、可是這個比較標準、是由很機械很呆板的程序來決定的、絕對不是隨意支配的、同時奉告投老諸君欲求錄取而又達到自己的志願、還是要靠自己努力、</p>
<p>（十）一般的批評</p>
<p>統考實行兩年以來、一般人對於這個制度的批評、大槪不外下列三端、</p>
<p>（一）寬嚴不同的概念　我們常常聽到一般人對於統考批評、有兩種不同的見解、在大學本身、每以錄取標準太低、不能提高程度、而社會方面、又恐錄取標凖太高、致使多數靑年失學、這兩種見解、雖是互相矛盾、但其立塲及出發點是不同的、我們先從寬的批評方面來說、第一、他們認爲錄取的標準太低、去年兩個標凖、最高是總分二百八十分、最低是二百一十分以七課目計算、平均分數不過四十分與三十分、今年錄取標準爲總分二百三十分、平均分數爲三十三分、其實所謂分數低是一般的低、低的原因、在前面我已經說過了、如果各個學校自行招考、倘一般考生分數太低、至少也得在低的中間選錄其成績較高者、無論如何、總不見得一人不取吧、還有一個補救辦法、個別招生如成績太差、尚可補招、可是統考因種種關係、是辦不到的、而且各校自行招生、錄取的學生、平均分數也有低於四十至三十分的、可見統考錄取的標準並不算低、再從錄取的比例來說、去年是二比一、今年已高至四比一、各校自招、雖然也有高至十比一者、但學生兼考數校、重複的錄取極多、這個比例、當然不是標準的、統一招考學生、只能投考一次、錄取的比例、實際亦大算大、何况今年的比例已比去年小、換一句話說、今年已比去年嚴格了一倍、還有一事、去年錄取的新生、因爲基本科目成績不良的緣故、敎部會頒布一種補習的辦法、這也是一般人認爲統考成績太低錄取不嚴的證據、其實國家在非常時期、中學生因前述的種種原因、成績不良、大學是應該設法來補救的、如果一定要提高錄取標準爲平均分數六十分的話、那末照今年的成績分配、全國只取到一百二十一名、試問國家每年花幾千萬來辦大學、就只取這麼少的學生嗎、以二十幾個大學平均分配、每校只取到五人、就够開一個大學嗎、我們戰時和戰後所需要的各種專門人才極多大學是造成專門人才的地方、如果所造成者僅有這麼微小的數量、如何能担當抗建的重大使命、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙仍少收買</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市、週六祇半天行市、且因下週一二兩日為耶穌聖誕、循例休業、致連星期日共有三天假期、故潛勢雖有轉軟模樣、但人心未曾完全被利多息所搖動、罕有奮起收吸者，至其看縮之原因、乃以當日報載央政府取締轉道香港英鎊匯款至中國、致將來港電吐出頭寸、無形减少、故晨初會引起華行等扒進、後賴外銀行供意尚濃、自以港電不久曾來拋售、故趨勢尚能站定、半天過程、晨開均平、少頃華行等稍扒、驟形微緊、旋香港電塞、再以外行供意亦濃、市勢一度轉硬、後以日行吸購、重行略緊、但至午刻、扒者漸乏、仍告回平、迄至午牧爲四辦士七零三一二五及七元七一八七五、與上日相埒、期貨趨勢、與現貨無別、</p>
<p>利多消息無影響</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期縮零六二五、遠期則無榮辱、紐約銀價停市、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法等各匯均平、美對英降一八七五、對滬大五分、對法小二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士七零三一二五、美匯七元七一八七五、較前收均無軒輊、開後因鑒報載英政府取締香港匯款至中國、是以華行等入市扒結、幸其時出口商適來吐出、且外行尚有供意、故市面所緊有限、九時一刻、英金已告四辦士六八七五、美匯亦爲七元六八七五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小半分、此後香港稍來供塞、且外行賣意亦佳、致市勢反見帶硬、英金曾硬至四辦士七一八七五、美匯亦喊過七元七八一二五、嗣後一度轉定、迨十一時許、日銀行突來扒進、情况再形微緊、英金又至四辦士六八七五、美匯重達七元六八七五、惟至午刻、日行止扒、狀態遂見回平、迄至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士七零三一二五、美匯七元七一八七五、下月期英金四辦士六七一八七五、美匯七元五九三七五、結果比上日、現期英美兩金俱無榮辱、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港滙市午刻縮</p>
<p>香港二十三日電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英美日各匯不動、申匯現貨微升一元、爲三百十七元、午收有轉軟模樣、英匯現貨緊零三一二五、爲一先令二便士九六八七五、遠期不動、美匯現貨縮零六二五、爲二十四元五六二五、日匯現貨亦緊二五、爲一百零四元二五、申匯現貨不動、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津英美滙價鬆</p>
<p>天津二十三日電、今晨匯市開盤穩定、英美匯現貨各鬆零六二五、英匯爲四便士半、美匯爲七元三七五、申滙降半元、爲一百零四元半、「聯鈔」暗盤不動、仍爲九十二元半</p>
<h3>假前金市不振</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、半天變動不大、但潛勢仍走穩境、蓋以某金號復來猛拋、（傳仍套進外匯）且因明後兩日為耶穌誕節、連續休假有三天之多、故散戶買進有限、一度險告不支、後幸賴港帮搜購、故結果所跌祗有六元、至半日過程、晨開外匯雖報微緊、但金價反小十二　、爲四千一百三十元、乃受金號銀樓帮撳　力賣故也、惟開後某銀號撈入曾被拉高數元、不久因滙市反報硬化、金號等賣風又起、再以進者寥落、續降達四千一百零五元低盤、嗣因匯市未幾重緊、某錢兌業趁賤搜入、港帮亦起活動、遂回高達四千一百三十八元、奈外匯回平、及余號一意吐出、即綏緩向下、尚賴某錢兌業繼代客帮拖進、仍爲四千一百三十六元收盤、午後塲內無市、而塲外潛勢轉穩、最後賣價爲四千一百四十五元、收進照减五元、半天交易約二千元左右、銀樓飾金結果仍平、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤續挫六元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開局勢虛疲、雖外匯略形帶軟、但某金號與銀樓帮均有賣意、且進者極少、開市反撳小十二元、某金號吐予證券帮十兩、爲四千一百三十元、少頃又低二元、銀樓帮售予證券帮二十兩、爲西千一百二十八元、嗣以某銀號進胃突濃、則代客戶收買、拉起十元、進金號三十兩、爲四千一百三十八元、旋因外滙突報轉硬、加以某金號銀樓帮及某錢兌業等競相吐出、進者頓審愼旁觀、　不久竟猛落三十三元、金號出證券帮十兩、爲四千一百零五元、幸其時另一錢兌業忽乘賤則拖、且港帮亦向市猛搜、再以外匯重形微緊、遂漸見回高、某銀樓進金號二十兩、爲四千一百三十八元、午刻外匯回平、又降小六元、錢兌業吐予銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千一百三十二元、後某錢兌業重來撈入、提起四元、金號進錢兌業十兩、爲四千一百三十六元、作午收價、結果比上日續小六元、半天三十三元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金先小後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百二十元、迨至十時零五分、掛小五元、正午回高五元、此後無變化、結果大同行仍懸四百二十元原價、新同行與上價相埒、收進約减小十五元光景、</p>
<h3>美金票獨見回升</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、交易稀少、因耶穌聖誕節已臨、投機商進出口行興趣减少、市况寗靜無變、僅美金票客戶趁做吸納、市價獨升、午間爲十二元九角五分、晚市爲十二元五角四分、較上日升六分、日金票供給續暢、市况虛弱、晚市爲一元二角六分五釐朝鮮票微堅秀、晚市爲一元一角一分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價堅昂</h3>
<p>米市營業、漸復正軌、市上銷塲頓見栗六、屆冬藏之期、而來源久斷、作客咸思備缺、所以昨市不約而同、羣相競購、對於洋米、以價最廉、尤所着意、交易擁擠異常、初開西貢即爲三十七元三角五分、餘外若厚薄粳及本客尖相五點綴、依限照別、開出者亦屬不鮮、如是者一路直上、西貢曾喊至三十八元、無如價格轟得太足、作客反都棘手致本鄕店胃頓鮮問津、市態　呆、重現數勢、收盤各貨價雖仍較前挺秀、約三五角之上落、若西貢爲三十七元五角、暹　米爲三十七元五六角、厚薄粳則較有參差、各隨客販售意爲轉移也、統計全市成交續有七八千包、</p>
<p>客秈到源、雖未間斷、今後江北一帶搬運不劃、來貨勢必再見减少、昨日則有江北與長江一帶到有一千包稍外、市塲正式售開價仍爲三十三元、惟特高各貨均無正式交易云、</p>
<p>洋米邇日到源又减、因早批已經到齊、十號以後及十五號裝船者、最早須至今明抵滬、而舖作鄉戶需要漸貪、市乃逐步挺秀、昨觀西貢三十七元七角、乃續大二角、而路貨原包則因產價高昂後定訂不劃之故、貨方均不肯輕脫、故昨市已開至四十五元四五角云、</p>
<h3>麵粉初疲後穩　麥市又擯</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨交易平常、除本街日常需要外、客胃淸閑、因値週末、兼雲南起義紀念及耶誕休假期屆、行囤相繼觀望、回籠老車牌棧單粉、初開一度降小、後市復昂、因米油價格復昂、引起一部份投機買賣者、在市吸收、一月份鳳凰牌日廠期粉、價由八元四角六分步升至五角六分、本月份亦須八元一角半、故本廠貨稍被帶起也、統市成交三萬餘包、二號粉廠盤仍為八元七角、市面變化、當待假期開關云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市又趨搜局、來源雖有零星點綴、而新到各貨均以成本高昂、不願貶價求脫、各廠以粉價難以過好、原料進價竟在擯小、行囤亦大都覜望、買賣互持、結果朱有正式成交、聞送廠貨價巳暗小二三角、恐後市或有看小之象、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆市平穩　—油拼油—　大有餘來聲明</h3>
<p>黃豆市况、因囤胃復活、高貨見缺、中次亦稍稍帶起、故大局暫時穩定、昨由本街囤戶辦去丁家州豆三車、價爲十七元七角至十八元、南市豆二車、十六元五角至十七元、蕪湖豆三車、十七元三角十七元六角、崇明沙黃百餘包、十九元、</p>
<p>芝蔴平疲、洋莊不動、本街揀廉稍進、昨有汕頭帮問津管店雪蔴一百包、價為三十五元五角、又粵帮辦去九江奶蔴二百餘包、價爲二十九元五角、</p>
<p>豆千二十四日運厦門一千二百七十九包、運新加坡三千三百七十五包、又生仁遝新加坡二百包、生油運厦門一千聽、芝蔴運新加坡四百九十包、</p>
<p>昨日本報自發表豆油拼用棉子油後、昨晚卽有大餘油廠蔣頌三君來館面稱、該廠所出產之豆油、向不貪圖小利、絕無攙和棉子油情事、且可至該廠實地考察云云、以大有餘之信用、自可信其决不肯出此下策、惟市上所售之豆油、能保無據雜情事、當非該廠所能顧問也、</p>

<h3>新加坡—英國遠東的堡壘—</h3>
<p>— 逸</p>
<p>日本南進政策</p>
<p>日本的泥足，雖膠着於中國大陸，可是她的南進政策、一直沒有放棄。她的在泰國（暹羅），鼓動當代政府，對中國的僑民，橫施壓迫，她的深入緬甸，嚴密注意當地出產汽　　域，並收買商營的油礦公司以及在當地組織政治機關，以圖陰謀搗亂，挑撥離間土著與英政府的感情，都是日本南進野心的事實表現。這種種陰謀的對象，都是顯然想打擊英國。當然在目前的形勢下，她還沒有這樣力量，可以實現她的一切企圖，可是無論如何，在遠東方面，有這樣一個侵略勢力存在，英國總是要日夜不安心的。就英國的立塲講，爲防止日本人的推行南進政策，使日本人的勢力，不能深入南洋，在外交上，自然須增强中國的抗戰力量，予日本以致命的打擊，使日本的氣燄，消沉下去，無法分身冉向其他地方推行其侵略政策。由種種事實證明，中英兩國的利害，是一致的，日本的勢力侵入泰國，首遭其害的，是華僑，而其最後受打擊的，却是央國。政治的進攻，是日本南進政策的開始，而軍事行動，纔是其最終政策的開始，纔是其最終目標。這一行動，如果有　天到來，就將與英國發生正式的衝突。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰發生後，日本許多人認爲是千載一時的機會。日本人想從「白人的衝突」中，獲得一筆很大的利益，那是毫無疑問的事。</p>
<p>新加坡的軍事上的重要</p>
<p>這樣一來，英國在遠東的堡壘，控制遠東與印度門路的新加坡，在軍事的意義上，自然日漸重要起來。英國自上次大戰後，就覺新加坡有建築軍港的必要，經過十五年的經營，目前新加坡軍港，已經能停泊英國最大的軍艦，並且還增闢了遠東最大的飛機塲。此外在新加坡島的四周，裝有長距離放射程的大砲，可以阻止他國軍艦的來攻，同時裝有高射砲，防衛飛機的襲擊。所以新加坡近幾年來，已變爲軍事重心的城市。她不獨是緬甸印度的屛蔽，並且也是澳門荷屬東印度法屬安南的重要軍事聯絡站。本年七月，英法在新加坡開聯防會議，英法殖民地當局，曾商定英法聯防的幾項辦法（一）河內法國飛機廠與澳洲飛機製造家合作，英法海軍負責保護太平洋法國產業，（二）駐澳英帝國空軍得利用法屬克利多民用機塲，（三）法屬安南將參加香港及新加坡聯防制度，（四）遠東戰事發生，英駐遠東艦隊總司令爲英法聯軍的最高統帥，以新加坡爲聯合作戰的根據地。根據這幾項重要的決定，新加坡已儼然成爲遠東英法及荷蘭的領土保衛的重鎮，它在軍事上的重要，不言已可明白了。</p>
<p>所不能鐵視的力量</p>
<p>不過我們不能已於言者，英法在新加坡及其遠東各殖民地上的軍事佈置，雖已有充分的凖備，在必要時，可以對付侵略他們利益的國家，而綽有餘裕，然而英法所不能忽視的而必需有的估計，那就是在防衛遠東的殖民地時，必須把中國抗戰的力量，足以使侵略者受了很大的牽制，而無法發動另一侵略——這一重要的因素估計在內，因爲有了中國這樣一個很重大的力量，才能一直到二次大戰已經發生了好幾個月的現在，日本還不敢輕於對英法啟　，英法可以高枕無憂，對付歐洲問題，而不必分出一大部分力量來防衛遠東的，就是這原因。明乎此，那末英法在中國暗中冀與日本進行種種妥協，以求買得日本歡心而使中國力量削弱的行動，可以憬然覺悟，改絃易轍了。</p>
<h3>為什麼　斯比上將號自己鑿沉？</h3>
<p>— （曹林曜）</p>
<p>斯比上將號上裝有十一吋口徑大砲六尊前後各有三尊。並且在艦尾裝有八個魚雷發射管。艦旁每邊有六吋口徑快砲七尊，共有十四尊。他的主要裝甲，厚達八吋，非有九吋口徑以上之大砲决不能破其裝甲。此次斯比上將號之受傷，係在船尾裝甲單薄之處，故英艦愛克斯脫號能以八吋的砲擊穿；若命甲該艦之中部，那决不能破甲。在普通的萬噸巡艦，常以下列爲標準。一種，爲九·二吋砲六尊，六吋十尊，小砲三十尊。還有一種其實力較爲單薄，有六吋之砲十六尊，十二磅砲十四尊，三磅四尊。（以上的磅，爲砲彈的重量。）德國的袖珍艦，爲什麽用這樣大口徑的砲，他把六吋的砲和小砲，統統减少，餘下的載重，裝以十一吋之大砲。八吋之砲彈和十一吋的砲彈相比，爲一比三。八吋的砲彈只能破八吋以下的裝甲，而十一吋的砲彈，其動量可大三倍，能破十三吋的裝甲。一般主力艦之裝甲，不過十三四吋。換句話說，就是德國的袖珍艦斯比上將號，能和主力艦作戰。而决不是一般的巡洋艦所能擊沉。</p>
<p>此次斯比上將號鑿沉，一般人都以爲萬噸的兵艦，那能和主力艦作戰，所以鑿沉。實在斯比上將號的火力，堪與英國的主力艦一戰。但是一旦英國的主力艦雷囊號，（三二〇〇〇噸其口徑爲十五吋）擊中那斯比上將號，恐怕十分危險。因爲他的體積太小。而雷囊號波他擊中一彈，則不致沉沒。這樣的看來，只有斯比上將號被英艦雷囊號擊沉的可能。而且還有航空母艦亞克號，（二五〇〇〇噸。）法艦鄧加克號，（二六〇〇〇噸）亦有十三吋之大砲。此外有埃基勒號，阿傑克斯號，共五艘。其火網構成的强力，可見一斑。雖然斯比號能指定着較小的兵艦猛攻。但至多也不過打掉他一二艘，他自己終有在敵人火網下沉沒之慮。如把兵艦交他國代管，有失國體，所以只好鑿沉，艦員登陸。若英艦被他打沉一二艘，其物力損失不過佔海軍總數百分之一，人員不過千分之五。而德艦之被擊沉，物質上佔十五分之一，人員亦佔十分之一。所以爲愛恤人力起見，寗願鑿沉。因爲物力的補充，可在最短期內滿足。而人力的補充。却頗爲不易。即一水兵，亦需三年造就成功，斯比號鑿沉之主要原因也即在此上圖即德國袖珍艦斯比上將號）</p>
<h3>江西省名之由來</h3>
<p>— 顧兆文</p>
<p>我國各省之名，大率都有來歷，有義可釋：如江蘇以江寗蘇州二地之首　字得名，浙江以轄境內最大之河流得名—浙江。獨於江西省，地悉在江南而名「江西」，實不甚可解；，即地理書所載亦不甚了了。蓋長江自西東流，以之區別地域有南北而無東西，何來、「江西」之稱。茲讀梁紹壬（淸錢唐人，宇應來，號普竹，道光舉人，官內閣中書）兩般秋雨庵隨筆，謂在六朝以前，其江西者，並在秦郡（今六安）歷陽（今和縣）廬州（今合肥）之境。故晋史地理志以九江自合肥以北至壽春（壽縣），皆謂之江西。蓋長江自九江至鎭江略成南北流的趨勢。則昔之所稱江西，大部為安徽工北之地。</p>
<p>至於稱今省（古饒·洪·吉諸州地）爲江西者，因唐開元年間，分天下爲十五道，而以舊時之江南道，又分爲東西二道，以江南東道理蘇州，江南西道理洪州，（今南昌）後人省文，但稱江東·江西。今江東已成歷史之名詞，而江西亦非長江以西之地，乃江南一部份之地耳。</p>

<h3>抗佔有中的廣西婦女</h3>
<p>— 華慰曾</p>
<p>——全國婦女界的模範——</p>
<p>爲求學故，由滬取道安南入桂，到宜山不覺已一月，沿途以及在宜觀感，覺桂省民治之所以有今日，大部應歸功於婦女。</p>
<p>廣西全境，大部爲邱陵地帶，石山起伏，在風景上，固有甲天下之譽，然在農產上，除森林以及數種適宜於砂土之植物外，土產瘠瘦，不宜於穀類以及菜蔬之生長。故大部居民，均窮困難於維生。兼之氣候惡劣，（廣西遠海，故完全爲大陸性氣候。所謂瘴雨蠻雨之鄕，即指桂西一帶。）惡疾叢生，在此環境下討生活，首重刻苦耐勞之精神。廣西婦女，即在此艱澀之環境下與男子受同樣之銀練而成者。自能獨立行走以迄於鶴髮豁齒之暮年，幾無日不在操作中。少女一入婆家，便成爲該家庭中努力生產者之一份子。舉凡田地畜牧上之一切工作，莫不躬自操作。每見鄉間婦女入城交易，背上負乳兒，肩上挑重担，而健步如飛，江浙人見之，誠羨慚交加。</p>
<p>廣西婦女思想單純，毫無機會與敎育接觸，然其誠實貞操之精神，却在此環境下無形養成。桂省報紙，絕少見及桃色新聞，廣西男子，爲軍隊中量精悍之部隊，原因固多，然無內顧之憂未始不爲其根本原因耳。未嫁之少女，亦絕無虛榮心，藍布衣褲，天足大辮，自然有一種樸實不華之氣槪。</p>
<p>在廣西大城市中之婦女，雖亦有一班趨於時尚者，然此亦必然之趨向，僅限於城市內層，一出外圈，大都尚未忘其本來面目。若在江浙，浮華奢侈之風，已漸侵入僻村小鎮，兼之得天獨厚，女千但知坐享其成。加以民風澆薄，缺少道德心，姦淫掠奪，卽在昇平之時，亦屢見不鮮，此種現象，男子固亦應負責，女子恐亦難逃其咎。</p>
<h3>本埠小新聞</h3>
<p>— 塵</p>
<p>（一）滬西區有某號，其陳設藥品之大玻璃窗，畫有白色梅樹一株，自下斜上，在玻窗對角綫處，細察之，知玻璃已開裂，其裂痕亦係對角綫處。由記者推測，玻窗開裂在前，梅樹繪畫在後。此係該號節省物力之極好方去，有同樣情形者，不妨仿傚也。</p>
<p>（二）精武體育會有一會員（係最近加入，）年十三歲，已有體重二百零五磅，身長五英尺半左右，三星期前記者遇之於精武體育會的浴室。浴客（亦即會員）爲之驚歎不止。</p>
<p>（三）北蘇州河路老垃圾橋亞新垃圾橋一段，可說搶棉掃米區。其地均爲銀行之大倉庫，每天裝運米麥棉花的卡車絡繹於途，一般貧民掃拾落下之米麥爲生；棉花不能落下，就乘間搶取。據云，僥倖一點的話，每天也有一二元的收入</p>

<h3>處身憂患的　比王利奧波德三世</h3>
<p>— 獨行</p>
<p>戰後邊防大見增強　光榮中立光榮就義</p>
<p>卅七年憂患生命</p>
<p>這位年方三十七歲登位方才五年的比國君主利奧波德三世，自幼便生於憂患之中。當一九一四年八月德軍侵比時候，他還是一個十三歲的孩子，面孔蒼白，身材碩長，穿着水手服裝，常依母親膝下，極不爲人們所注意，都認爲是一個孱弱的孩子；但是四年大戰的悲劇，使他變成一個個性堅强，面孔嚴肅的人，使人望而有凛然起敬之槪。大戰結束後，他雖然身爲勃雷朋大公（Duke　of　Brabant）和一國的儲君，但他過着平民化的生活，直到他的父親亞爾培王墜崖身死始止。</p>
<p>戰後國防一般</p>
<p>利奧波德三世在位以來五年中，歐洲正處在險惡的風雲中，希特勒繼世界經濟不景氣的聲浪潛自登台後，即不斷向外擴張德國勢力，進兵萊茵區域，撕毀凡爾塞和的，兼併捷奧，聲勢咄咄迫人。比國凛於第一次世界大戰的敎訓，努力從事鞏固國防。第一次大戰時前比王亞爾培率軍堅守待援的李奇（Liege）砲台區現在已建成新式的陣綫，密佈戰壕與機關槍座。在這砲台區之後，又築有一條「小馬奇諾防綫」，係由法國工程師建造；接着又是一條新開的「亞爾培運河」，一百二十呎闊，十五呎至二十呎深，兩岸密置機關槍和大砲，國防已比上次大戰時堅强百倍。</p>
<p>光榮中立與光榮就義</p>
<p>比利時原爲德國入法之側門，同時好的海岸面到英國三島，當德軍急攻馬奇諾防綫不達，並且德國亟於取得接近英國本部的潛艇根據地的時候，希特勒自不惜製造口實，犧牲荷比兩國。利奧波德三世從他幼年的經騐中，深知今日正是比利時光榮中立，或者光榮就義的日子。德軍如果侵比，我們不難看到這位年輕的君主，憑他舊日慘痛的經騐，振臂抗敵！</p>
<h3>磁性水雷之謎</h3>
<p>— 欲</p>
<p>希特勒所誇示的新兵器</p>
<p>在歐戰發生以後，德國希特勒總統曾經誇說「將用最新發明的精銳武器，予敵人以重大打擊，」這新武器究竟是什麽，沒有明言，但鑑於最近德國敷設水雷的威脅，和英法船隻損失的巨大，或者這水雷就是德國所誇示的新武器了。美國的軍事專家對此很感興味，以爲歐戰已進入長期戰爭的形態，英國加緊海上封鎖德國努力擊沉船舶，將是兩方主要的戰略。而自德國敷設水雷之後，全世界都想知道這種水雷究竟是怎樣的東西？有怎樣的威力？報紙上都紛紛加以討論推測，據美國陸軍專家的意見，以爲「這種水雷是用飛機撒布敷設的，」而且水雷上必有一種落下傘的設備，由飛機投下以後，落下傘在海中自動開放，使水雷沉留於適當的位置。用這個方法投下的水雷，比較用潛艇敷設的有一點最便利的地方，就是任何窄狹的海峽，甚至泰晤士河的河口，也可以自由敷設。軍事家又推定德國所使用的飛機，必能携帶重達五百磅的水雷的自八個至二十個。</p>
<p>其次是水雷的種類，美國海軍部機雷專家哈蒙認爲德國目前所使用的水雷不過前次大戰時德土二國所用「雷翁」機雷的變形。對一般所推測說是磁性水雷一說，加以否定。所謂「雷翁」機雷內裝三百磅的强力炸藥，其自身比排水的水量稍重，沉入海中達一定深度以後，因了水壓力的作用，振動水壓瓣，使電動機的電路開關接通，遂轉動推進機，重復上昇，至離海面十八英呎，則又自行下沉，這樣上下浮動，就是德國水雷的特徵。</p>
<p>但是也有人推想德國水雷，必是一種磁性水雷。他們以爲這是屬於固定機雷之一種，其內部炸藥，乃藉船體和敷設水雷二者鋼鐵裝甲間的磁力而爆發，不過磁石與目的物的距離過遠則效力即减，所以威力並不怎樣利害，德國如加利用，必用種種機件，以爲補助，這補助機件，才是德國的最新發明。</p>
<p>以上是美國軍事專家的二派意見，就目前看來，如果德國用的眞是磁性水雷，那末他的構造，或者是利用靈敏的磁針，平時磁針指着南北，水雷留於一定地位。一旦船舶在其附近通過，因爲船身鋼鐵的吸引，使磁針易向，由磁針的變向，使內部的電氣機構，接成通路，轉動馬達，推動水雷使向着船身方向迅速前進，觸着信管，才起爆發，這樣的機構或者非不可能，這自然也是推測之詞，究竟怎樣，要等待專家的研究了。</p>
<p>現在被德國水雷擊沉的船舶，日有所聞，雖中立國船隻，也所不免，怎樣防禦，怎樣掃除，實是現在各國，尤其是英國急想解決的問題。</p>

<p>說起支加哥，稍有地理常識的人都知道是世界有名的大都市，近來經地質學家的硏究，發見其地層有許多都是珊瑚礁所構成，其直徑有的爲三十英尺，有的爲三英里，據說這是在幾萬年前熱流籠罩着北美洲內部時所結成的</p>

<p>「醫生！我的妻患盲腸炎，現在痛極！請你快來。」一個醫生熟識的靑年這樣說。</p>
<p>醫生嘆了一口氣，呌他快點去睡。他說：「你給點薑湯給她吃，我明天一早就來，她不是患盲腸炎呀！」</p>
<p>這位靑年愈加發急，一口咬定她是患盲腸炎。醫生大聲說：「一定不是，三年前我已替尊夫人割去了，一個人是不能有二個盲腸的。</p>
<p>「難道一個人不能有二個老婆麼？」少年說：原來他的第二位夫人也生同樣毛病的。</p>
<h3>兩性衛生　身心健康能導</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>夫婦之愛趨於專一</p>
<p>健康是一切事業成功之母，這眞是至理明言。英國心理學家勃朗雪尼氏曾調查一百六十對愛情淡薄的夫婦中。證明其中缺愛的原因，十分之三由於經濟的關係，十分之五由於健康失常的關係，十分之二由於個性的不合，但十分之三的經濟關係，究其實在間接亦因健康失常，致收入大爲影响所致。卽以愛情的一方面而言，婚姻的最大目的，是將男女之愛融合爲一，繁衍子嗣。故必須生殖之機能健康無病，他康對於婚姻的重要也就可以明瞭。就是單硏究雙方幸福，融洽的空氣，也是强壯夫婦方能造成，倘使終年與病魔相親，那末唱隨的樂趣，喪失無遺了。</p>
<p>今要硏究婚後男子之所以腎虧衰弱，此都因婚前不守童貞及染自凟惡癖所致。在發育之時最怕早婚或狎邪遊，其次之自凟均能致體格衰弱，精力渙散，遺精而腎虧，婚前患此疾病，應速治療，在未治好之前，請勿結婚，蓋結婚必無愛情故也。</p>
<p>治療此種疾病，惟有施用內分泌劑方有速治之希望，以余多年來治療上述各症之經騐而論，德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」為眞正採自少壯動物之靑春腺素製劑，發明人梅倫博士本二十餘年之硏究而問世，不僅見效迅速，且成分可靠，凡神經衰弱，未老先衰，發育不全，早洩陰痿，遺精滑精，腎虧不育，面色蒼白，年老力衰，冬季畏寒，四肢無力等症，日服三次，經過一個月之後，無不壯健逾恒，確具補腦，補血，補腎之三大效能，余在臨床上使用七年，從未遇失效病例，故敢介紹於病家。「補體康」分男用女用兩種，女用「補體康」爲純粹卵巢內分泌製劑，有調經種子奇效，凡患子宮陣礙疾病，一服即愈，故「補體康」誠爲家庭之良藥，愛情之保障。</p>
<h3>肺病與咳嗽　盛在强醫師</h3>
<p>肺爲呼吸器重要之器管。此項器管。因司重要之工作。故每易受傷。如偶因不愼而致流行性感冒。最易招致咳嗽。而此種咳嗽。又每極頑固。所以一時殊雞治愈。患者。又每因此而走入肺癆之途。蓋吾人大多潛伏一種結核菌（即癆菌）。因抵抗力强大。足可鎭制此菌之活動。但每因咳嗽而减弱其抵抗力。故患者如能在咳嗽時服用肺病聖藥『補肺拿爾」以鎮咳除痰。則咳嗽卽可三數小時治愈。並可短期治愈肺病。使呼吸器管活動健全。則四肢百骸亦甚健康矣。</p>
<h3>白獨免除手術的痛苦</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>以淋病特效藥免除手術的痛苦　世界各國醫家一致稱譽新發明</p>
<p>今日言病治療。非空談足以取信於人。亦非普通藥劑所能奏功。更非專恃手術所能取效。以言某法治淋病。徒失之於誇大。皆非學者之態度。故余概不取乎此。顧余自留美專攻醫學卒業後。於返國之途中。順道至歐陸各科學先進國家。實地考察。因素知德國彼德博士所發明之淋病特效藥『克淋儂』特專往德國實地考察各大醫院。對於淋病之處置。始知一致皆推獎『克淋儂』一藥。柏林物浦花柳病院院長云。『淋病之醫治上。如能避免手術固甚佳事。然而從前醫家。對於淋病之醫治。幾乎全恃手術。現在治療白濁之情形。今昔已大異其趣。蓋現在已有『克淋儂』一藥。可服用。且可根治淋病所不能及到之病狀云』。因此足知『克淋儂』功效之一斑。査此劑係用特製蛋白體黃色素等混合製成。服之因起化學上之作用。其殺菌力極爲强大。但不損害健全之組織。此爲其特點。良以『克淋儂』製煉。無一不合科學。故絕無雜質殘留。致有不良之副作用。凡是初起急性淋。或因失治而轉入慢性淋。均可服之。在急性淋時。服『克淋儂』可免轉入慢性。其已入慢性者。亦可於短期中徹底治愈。此亦『克淋儂』之特點也。外用藥方面。可出『抗淋水』作尿道洗滌。以淸除尿道間淋菌。婦女淋毒白帶可外用『卡而雪地陰道片』為坐藥。則帶淨濁止矣。（『抗淋水』五洲大藥房有售）</p>
<h3>身體極度虧損則禁慾後亦能遺精</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>常謂荒淫縱慾及自凟過度、為釀成一切衰弱的主要原因，故照一般治療方法中，暫時的禁慾，實為必要。而不知腎虧之人，雖節慾以養生，但遺精必乘之而起，遺精之後，其害等於縱慾，不僅於健康無益，且長此以往，腎虧愈甚，不知者目爲禁慾之無益，反放縱如前，故其病勢，終不能减輕。</p>
<p>禁慾後之遺精，健康者亦有之，此係生理的，無關重要，腎虧者，因精關弛鬆，勃起神經之過敏，在睡夢中，精液會滑漏而出，治療之法，宜先止其遺精，培補虧損，擯絕烟酒等刺激品，如在婚前，尤應淸心寡慾，戒絕自凟。關於治遺精及培補之藥劑，經醫師在臨床上實驗者，首推用德國遺精專藥「耐而斯遺精片」在睡前服此，保證遺精不發。同時進服德國睪丸內分泌製劑男用「補體康」以補腦，補腎，補精，補血，見效神速，兩藥同服不論任何嚴重性之性神經衰弱症，有藥到病除之妙，故願爲文介紹，以供病家之採用。</p>
<p>淋病府談</p>
<h3>白濁可以輕忽不治乎</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所寗波路九號四川路口診時上午十時至下午六時</p>
<p>淋毒本來不是難於治療的疾患，而終於成爲難治者果係何原因？</p>
<p>淋病固然不能用了不得的態度去置理牠，但亦不可用輕忽的態度去放任牠。實在說起來，淋病本非難治的疾患。在余廿數年來之經驗中，淋病初起治療得宜，而病家又能遵醫家攝生之法，則初起淋病，誠不足慮矣！在急性淋時，因其病根未深，故挽救自易，蓋患者與不潔異性接觸之後，在三五天內，必起一種尿道搔癢，故尿時有灼熱刺痛之感。此時即爲淋菌在尿道粘膜上，發生一種破壞人體健全之生理的反應；其後此等症狀漸見嚴重，痛苦不堪，馴至排尿不能，膿血交流。此時患者心慌意亂，只求目前痛苦之暫時止住，而忽視來日之病變。蓋急性淋時之痛苦，乃生理上應有之反應。如用一時麻醉之劑，妄冀止痛於一時，則無異削弱生理上之抵抗力。予淋毒以可乘之機。故病勢必日趨惡化，如在急性淋時，最佳切勿勞動，並用感應靜電療法，及X線療法交互爲用，一方進服淋病聖藥『克淋儂』，以殺菌消炎鎮痛，則急性淋病，不僅可以將痛苦解決，且可進一步將淋菌全部消滅，此爲淋病最進步而妥善之療法，此亦余廿年來在統計上最可靠的淋病療法也　每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角，並贈性病全書一冊　兼治梅毒橫痃下疳性神經衰弱等症。負責尅期治愈。</p>

<h3>耶誕節勿忘雲南起義</h3>
<p>— 宛文</p>
<p>明天是什麼日子，誰都知道是耶誕節，就是記憶力不強的小朋友，看見櫥窗裏擺着笑咪咪的耶誕老公公許多有趣的玩具，花花綠綠的賀年片，比平時格外新奇，格外華麗，不期然的想到耶誕節是降臨了。於是商店中，公司裏，多着小朋友的蹤跡，購買玩具糖果和賀年片，更忙於親戚同學間禮物的往來，整天快樂得手舞足蹈。耶誕節是慶祝耶穌的誕生，是應當歡欣的，在全世界歡騰的當兒，小朋友們再想一想，十二月二十五日到底是什麼日子，耶穌誕生是不錯的，可是中華民國的誕日，大多數人是遺忘的了。現在就讓我們靜心的回憶一下吧！當袁世凱野心勃發做皇帝的時候，蔡鍔不畏艱難，不辭辛勞的一手推翻專制，奠定了民國的基礎，這偉大的壯烈的革命運動，在歷史上稱之為雲南起義，而很凑巧的和誕生同月同日，所以我們在快樂的慶祝耶誕節之餘，靜默數分鐘來紀念先烈們光榮的犧牲吧！</p>
<p>照習俗，每逢佳節，在親戚朋友間以禮物相送，表示愉快和紀念的意思。明天耶誕佳節，本想預備些禮物與小朋友共樂，無奈物價如此高漲，與其買禮物不如省下錢來幫助飢餓被逼的難胞們。况且物質上的禮物總有毀壞和消滅的一天，倒不如把耶穌的博愛和蔡鍔不畏艱難的精神相贈，切望小朋友誠懇的接下，作為日常生活的規勉。</p>
<h3>耶誕老人的故事</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>耶誕節又到了！街頭換了一番新的氣象。許多商店的櫥窗裏，都添上一個穿紅衣服，摃大包裹的白鬚老人。你們知道這個老人是誰？</p>
<p>原來這老人，呌克勞斯。他是六世紀時的人，住在荷蘭地方，他的性情很慈善，常常歡喜幫助人家，所以人家都稱他為聖克勞斯。據說他身上穿着的那件紅衣服，是打俄羅斯那邊借來的。他所帶的一頭鹿，和那架雪車，是芬蘭國裏崇拜他的人送給他的。</p>
<p>他的鄰居，是一個很和善的人。家中有三個女兒，因為家境貧困，沒有錢嫁伊們。聖克勞斯知道了這事，就決心要去幫助伊們。</p>
<p>一天，他在夜間偷偷地走到鄰家的窗口，把一袋金錢拋了進去。第二天早上，鄰居發現之後，快樂得什麼似的，就把他的大女兒嫁出去了。</p>
<p>這時，他的鄰居覺得很奇怪，怎麼常常會有人送他錢？他便決計躲在屋旁守候，看看贈錢的到底是誰？</p>
<p>不久，聖克勞斯又去送錢，他剛把一袋錢拋進去，那躲在旁邊的鄰居就跑過來，跪在他老人家面前，向他拜謝。</p>
<p>聖克勞斯不但送錢給鄰居，還時常送禮物給兒童。荷蘭的兒童在耶誕節的夜間，往往將一個空的襪子掛在窗口，希望聖克勞斯把禮物帶來，塞滿他們的襪子。</p>
<p>後來，聖克勞斯的名字，慢慢地由荷蘭傳到了別地方去，全世界的兒童，沒有一個不歡迎他的。</p>
<h3>耶誕樹的故事</h3>
<p>— 陳思悌</p>
<p>小朋友們：一年一度的耶誕節，又很快的降臨人間了；走過各大公司的門口，都能夠看見有一顆顆的二尺來高的小杉樹陳列着，在樹上還點綴着一盞盞的小電燈，和一些用棉花做成的雪花，看去眞是非常美麗；這小杉樹，就呌做耶誕樹。但是，小朋友：你們能知道這聖誕樹的故事嗎？</p>
<p>從前，在德國愛爾賽斯的地方，有一個樹林，呌做赫斯拉琪，在這一個樹林裏，住着一位聖者，名呌聖福樂雲亭，他非常歡喜孩子，所以一般孩子們也非常歡喜他。</p>
<p>有一次，正是耶誕節將降臨的時候，聖福樂雲亭就想怎樣去招待一般孩子們來慶祝，因為他很窮，買不起玩具來送給孩子，並且在那樹林裏，也沒有玩具店，所以他只好想其他的辦法了。</p>
<p>一天早晨，他正在樹林裏散步，忽見一顆小杉樹，因為隔夜才下過雪，所以樹身滿推着白白的雪花，樹枝上又倒掛着一條條的小冰柱，陽光照得冰柱眩耀着，好像是金剛石的樣子；他看了，就發生了一種奇想。立刻把那小杉樹掘起來，拿回家中，再把許多果子和用蜜及麵粉做成的十字架形的餅，掛在樹枝上，又用金蠟做成小蠟燭，挿在樹頭，這樣才佈置妥善，就是耶誕之夜了。</p>
<p>在那天夜裏，聖福樂雲亭招待了許多孩子，孩子們看到這一顆小杉樹上，有金黃的燭光，照耀着紅綠的果子，眞是五光十色，萬分美麗，大家歡天喜地，就圍在小杉樹的四週，跳舞，唱歌，直到深夜，才興盡而散。</p>
<p>從此以後，愛爾賽斯地方的人民，凡慶祝耶誕時，都有一顆小杉樹點綴在家中；不久，也由德國而傳遍全世界了。</p>
<h3>吿小朋友</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>每逢耶誕節前，在荷蘭有一個風俗：做家長的都贈給他們的子女一隻用瓦製的似豬一般的匣子，呌他們把節上應用去的錢節省下來藏在裏面。據說，日後如把所藏的錢化用有不正當地方，就會遭遇到極大的不幸。</p>
<p>小朋友們！耶誕節不是又來了嗎。你們的家長雖不會送給你們這種禮物，可是我們應該有這個意思：就是決不要再向我們的家長討錢來買那些無意義的東西。「節省」這是小朋友在物價飛漲聲中最低的條件。</p>
<p>最後，希望各位小朋友，能够自動地來立下一個誓：「在今年的耶誕節，我要學荷蘭小朋友的樣，不再浪費一個錢。」</p>
<h3>華盛頓的耶誕禮物</h3>
<p>— 蕙</p>
<p>大家都知道華盛頓是美的國父，誰知道他為了國家的自由獨立曾經那樣不顧一切辛勞危險而奮鬥過的！</p>
<p>在他那時候，和他作戰的英國一軍的力量實在遠超過了他的軍隊。於是華盛頓就被逐出了勃羅克令；接着又退出紐約；為避免他軍隊被擊潰，更退到了紐傑賽；最後他跨過特拉華河，才得到片時的安定。</p>
<p>許多被英國僱傭着來與美國作戰的海賽兵來到了脫萊登，那是特拉華河沿岸的一個地方。</p>
<p>華盛頓帶領了他的軍隊同海賽兵只隔了一條河對立着。他們已失却勇氣，因為他們曾被敵軍勢如破竹地從勃羅克林一路上趕下來，這時又是嚴寒的冬天，他們非但沒有和暖的屋子住，甚至於連厚實一些的衣服都沒有，他們所穿的只是人民所給的舊衣服，有些兵只好赤着脚在冰凍的地上走。</p>
<p>海賽兵和另一些英國兵在等候河面結冰，那時他們就可以從冰面上進兵。他們決定再跟華盛頓戰鬥一次，預備拿華盛頓的兵隊全部覆滅。</p>
<p>這時華盛頓亦在想一些事。他在等候耶誕節的到臨，他知道海賽兵那一天在河彼岸凖要大吃大唱地歡樂一次。</p>
<p>在耶誕節到臨那天的下午，在脫萊登的海賽兵們果然熱鬧起來，他們喝了酒，吃了美味的食品，又在引吭高歌了。華盛頓却在對岸不顧寒冷地進兵，幾個赤脚的兵進行時，又在雪地上留下了許多血跡。</p>
<p>人和砲擠滿了許多小船，這些船都只好靠了竹篙慢慢地撑着才推動的。河面已浮動着成塊的冰。但在這一夜的功夫，小船雖慢，却已往返了幾次，把許多人都運過了河。</p>
<p>是耶誕節後一天的早晨三點鍾，末一批美圖兵已渡過了河。天實在冷得厲害，還在下着雪和冰雹。兩三個兵給凍死了。</p>
<p>早晨八時，華盛頓他們到了脫萊登。海賽兵却還在黑甜鄕中，美國兵的軍鼓聲把他們驚醒了，趕忙從床上跳下，直跑到街上，還想跟美國兵拼下　命。</p>
<p>可是太遲了，他們砲早給華盛頓他們搶去；美國兵都向他們發槍，他們只好朝田地裏逃去，不幸，又給美國兵捉住了。戰事不多時就結束，華盛頓得了九百多個俘虜。</p>
<p>這呌做脫萊登戰役。使美國當時的人民都興奮地快樂起來，而這次勝利就是華盛頓獻給國家的耶誕禮物。</p>
<h3>出路　—明兒避難記之四十八—</h3>
<p>「這樣一天天無聊的過去，也不是一件事。」明兒的父親把日子度得太乏味了，因此時常這樣的咕噥着，這也難怪他，因為他自朝至暮除了吃與睡之外，總是枯坐着，間或看看書，可是這寥寥幾本帶着一同逃難的書籍，一看便完了，有時去跑跑山路，但也走得打不起他的興趣來。又在這舉目無親的村子裏，簡直找不出一件適合明兒父親可做的事，就是在縣城裏也沒有辦法。那些逃難帶來的錢，眼見得從箱子裏一天天飛出去，便沒有再飛回來的可能了。只有消費，沒有生產，有限的金錢，隨着日子的逝去而减少着。每到的開支雖是極力節省，然而一天開門七件事，緊縮得無可再縮，已打算到了最低的限度，可是無論如何，每個人總不肯餓肚子的，吃飽了，才肯放下碗來，因此每天總要一塊錢左右的開支，而錢却用一錢短一錢了。就是有如山高的金錢，坐着吃，不事生產，也有「山空」的一天，這個問題在明兒家裏的每一個人都焦念着，而明兒的父母更是關切。</p>
<p>「在這村子裏要是再這樣的下去，一定要有沒有錢的一天，到了那天，怎麼辦？將來時局一平靜，那裏來回鄕的船費呢？現在乘餘下的一些錢，離開這個村子去尋我們的生路，不然，衹好餓死在這裏。但是我一個人去呢？還是合家？這麼一大羣，總有些不便，尤其在這軍事緊急的當兒。要是一個人去，雙方如果遭到什麼不測之事，但願沒有，要是有，怎麼辦」？這一大串難以解決的問題，從皺着眉的明兒，父親的嘴裏說出來。害得每人的臉上現出極度不快的面色。然而最後，經過了父親數番的斟酌，才決定合家離開這裏。三個月前目為唯一的人間桃源，而在明兒家的每一個人現今的心目中却是個死村了</p>
<p>這個消息傳到房東太太的耳鼓裏，雖表示挽留，可是明兒父親是很堅決的要「離開這裏」，然而這樣仁慈的房東太太，確使他們十二分的感謝。伊更送了他們兩具在村子裏唯一取暖的火熥作為紀念。（火熥，比普通的點心籃子還要深一些，可是沒有底的，籃裏放著瓦製或洋鐵製的有底而無蓋圓筒芯子，在筒裏面放些燒紅的柴炭，更把鉛絲或銅絲的蓋罩在籃子，便是一具絕好的暖具。在這村裏很是風行，因為木炭在這村裏是最價賤的東西，一塊錢可以買到又高又大的二簍，足足有一百多斤。在大冷的天氣，村子裏的每一個大的，小的，老的，幼的，放在長袍或裙子下烘着手滿街亂走，似乎是凸着肚子很有趣的樣子。連乞丐也帶着它討飯。）那房東太太送給他們的兩具，編製得十分靈巧，銅絲蓋也是很精細，眞使他們感激不盡。</p>
<p>這幾天來，明兒家裏又是忙亂異常，父親出去探聽一路的行程。母親在家裏包包紮紮，整理整理。足足費了有三天的光景</p>
<p>在離別這個村子的前夜，那房東太太眞客氣的替他們餞行，因此他們又嚐得了村裏的口味。伊更熱切地盼望他們將來重遊舊地，換過了在這村子裏又靜又冷的最後一晚。在天色微明中，才悄悄離別了這個亂世桃源！「願那仁慈的房東太太壽無疆！」自明兒家每一個人的心坎中作了這一句懇切的默禱！</p>
<p>再會吧！他們一羣漂泊無歸的逃難人踏上了求生的旅途！（全文完了）</p>
<h3>耶穌降生與社會　（續）</h3>
<p>耶穌之立意，不但是釋放俘擄而已，更是積極的提倡眞理的和平，全世界在公義的基礎上建設眞理正義的和平，使大小諸國民族，共享自由平等的福利，這是神降世的政策。</p>
<p>（七）使受壓制的得自由，耶穌之降生和十字架之捨生，原是救贖世人脫罪孽之權勢，而得慧的生命，聖經所昭示社會道德的標準，是公義是博愛是自由，提示人生的本務，是愛人，是服務人羣，使人得天國的生活，壓制·欺凌·剝削·侵奪·是違反以上提示的標準，及是萬惡的根源，也是禍亂的根源，耶穌降生於被壓制的階級之下，為要將壓迫之下的人贖出來，富者欺貧，貴者虐賤，強者凌弱，大者呑小，古今中外如出一輒，耶穌生於木匠貧窶之家，形同奴僕，為要將貧賤為奴的人們解放出來，他對門徒說，我不視你為僕，乃視為友朋，並實行為之洗脚，提示道範，以資效法，由是保羅講道之書翰中，亦富含自由之意義，指一奴隸對於主人說，他不是奴，乃是弟兄，你善待他，即不待字啻我身受也，」美國第八總統林肯，亦得此心傳，創釋放之偉業，促進世界之文明，飲水思源，源由耶穌之降生，因耶穌降生，人格的價値狂漲，人生觀為之一度，人們得為上帝之子，世間轉為上帝之聖幕，將如天使之歌曰至高之境，榮耀歸於上帝，大地之上，平安賞給蒙恩之民。經云：道成了肉身，居住人世之間，充充滿滿有恩典與眞理，令人得新生命以臻豐盛而永生。　完</p>

<h3>聖誕禮物與影星</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>每年到了聖誕節，好萊塢的影星們，總會收到大批的禮物，其中大部份是從各地的影迷那裏送來的。最近，有一本美國的電影雜誌，把近數年來幾位比較聞名的影星在這個佳節前後所收到的禮物，列成了下面的一張統計：</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒　平均每年所獲影迷贈送聖誕禮品的價値，往往要超過三十萬元美金以上。</p>
<p>安密勒　她在好萊塢是以跳足尖舞聞名的，所以，每年各地影迷送來的禮物中，總以皮鞋一項爲最多。</p>
<p>狄安娜　萍　她在工作閒暇時，常喜作乒乓之戲，因此她每年收到的聖誕禮物中，各式各樣的乒乓球或球拍亦不在少數。</p>
<p>却爾斯勞頓　他在好萊塢有唯一「愛花癖」之稱，各地的影迷亦頗能投中他的意志，所以，一個聖誕節中，別的禮物，他是難得收到的。</p>
<p>米蓋羅納　到過好萊塢的人，都知道他是一個球迷，不論足球，網球，排球等他都喜歡玩；因此，願意同他接近的，最好在聖誕節日就送他一只球。</p>
<p>喬治勃倫　他每年所收到的聖誕禮物，可以說冉沒有一個影星比他更少了。原來他有着一種怪脾氣，就是不喜歡有人來討好他，羨讚他；據說，甚至有時新聞記者要把他的名字發刊在報紙上，他亦是不願的</p>
<p>薛尼托勒　自從華納夏能逝世後，銀幕上的中國大偵探陳査禮一角就由他來飾演，爲了這，他的名字頓時響起來了；就亦爲了這，他在去年的聖誕日收到的影迷們的禮物，差不多全帶點東方色彩。</p>
<p>其他，如華雷斯皮萊，維多麥克勞倫等所謂是粗魯的明星，在每年聚誕節前後是决不會收到手帕，香水，新裝等一類的禮物。相反地，如茂娜洛埃，瑙瑪希拉，瑪琳黛德麗等所謂是貴淑的明星，每年收到的聖誕禮物終逃不了上列的幾件東西。</p>
<h3>談「中旅」的復活</h3>
<p>— 金元良</p>
<p>和上海觀衆闊別三年捲土重來的中國旅行劇團，今天起在璇宮劇院上演了。「中旅」是一個所謂「紅底子」，這次重來，陣容又較以前整齊，大紅大紫，自在意中。</p>
<p>「中旅」這次重來的第一聲，恰好趕上聖誕節，聖涎節，也恰好是我們的民族復興節，托爾斯泰的「復活」是有若干的宗敎氣味的，這和聖誕節在現在的不成爲基督敎徒同樣，是有着異曲同工的。而從「復活」這題名和我們的國運連繫着來看，也可說是極盡善頌善禱之能事，而在民族復興節演這個戲，更使我們有會心的微笑。</p>
<p>何况，這次的上演「復活」，還全爲難胞籌款的呢。</p>
<p>繼「復活」之後，據說從明年元旦起，即將上演魏如晦的「西太后」，導演者吳永剛，和魏先生已經是再度合作了，演員方面，除唐若靑等將全體出動外，並特約王熙春劉瓊等客串演出。還有若靑的妹妹湘靑小姐，也將在「西太后」中擔任一個角色，湘靑在上海還不曾演過戲，根據外埠的奧論，則演技實不亞乃姊，「西太后」中，便可給我們一個證明。</p>
<h3>影星龔秋霞近影</h3>

<h3>國華花絮</h3>
<p>— 一心</p>
<p>「李阿毛與唐小姐」，已在金城公映，唐小姐即華東電台之報告員，聞國華將以李阿毛爲滑稽片之主幹，冀與王先生並駕齊驅於上海影壇，此片爲其發軔繼之而起者，爲李阿毛與東方朔」，開古裝滑稽片之新紀元。</p>
<p>龔稼農飾多妾主義之牛八，劇中因欲娶唐小姐，尤其條件，剃去髭鬚，據云，戰後入內地，留鬚已逾兩年，此次爲電影犧牲，頗爲惋惜。李阿毛慰之曰：「鬚鬚（諧音些些）小事，何足掛齒」。</p>
<p>「亂世英維」之劇情，進行得從容不迫，而奇祟突起，有令人不可測度之妙。攝製日期特多，因布景宏大，戰鬬塲面特多之故。</p>
<h3>「藝術世界」出版</h3>
<p>綜合電影平劇音樂歌舞圖文並茂之「藝術世界」，明日出版，作者有費穆周信芳郎靜山唐喬司及各專家數十人，計十數萬言。照圖有首席名伶影星及中西影片劇照數十幅，彩色封面爲陳雲裳與周璇，實爲近年僅見之精美畫刊。每冊四角，報攤影院及國外大書店均有代售。</p>
<h3>迎聖宴舞</h3>
<p>耶誕節前夜，上海將展開盛大的歡狂面。卡樂，會樂宮，新的舞塲開出，大華，璇宮，戲劇樂府問世，市招飄滿新鮮的街頭，年禮，娛樂，宴會，遊息，是一個消息，耶誕節的前夜，新都飯店將通宵營業，玻璃電台澈夜編演精彩節目，全部餐廳舉行「迎聖大宴舞」。</p>
<p>關於玻璃電台的節目，則有「星期兒童聖誕播音會」，其次是文濱和春軒的申曲，嶺南的女歌星大會串，鄧叔宜的粵樂大會，金社，新時代女子平劇綵排，並加兒童平劇綵排全本「宋十回」，光裕社全體彈詞名家聯合演出，名女彈詞家趙梅芳，趙蘭芳親目編導「落金扇」。</p>
<p>這在上海游藝界可說是迎祝耶誕中盛最大的一　吧！</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Balkan Situation and Soviet-Italian Opposition</h3>
<p>Will Italy, the only major European power that has remained neutral and not directly participated in the war, be drawn into the vortex? Will the southeastern corner of the European continent, the only region spared the smell of gunpowder, once again be devastated? The answer to both questions depends on the development of the Balkan situation. In any corner of the world, the complexity of international relations is unmatched, but the Balkan Peninsula is second to none. The composition of this complex situation has both "internal" and "external" elements. The "internal" elements lie in economics and ethnicity, while the "external" elements include the European powers that manipulate the fate of the Balkans. These two elements are mutually causal, and to understand the situation in the Balkans, one must consider both simultaneously.</p>
<p>The entire socioeconomic organization of the Balkans, even now, has not escaped the semi-feudal state controlled by the aristocratic landlords in the vertical aspect; in the horizontal aspect, it remains a semi-colony that supplies raw materials and food to Germany, Italy, Britain, and France, and its economic relationship with Germany is particularly close. The lives of the majority of the people are extremely difficult; thus, Nazism and Communism have both taken the opportunity to enter and brew international socioeconomic reform movements.</p>
<p>There are also extremely complex ethnic issues among the Balkan countries; and so-called "Pan-Germanism" and "Pan-Slavism" are precisely using the guise of "ethnic minorities" to exaggerate and plot something. Hitler said that his "compatriot brothers" dispersed in Hungary, Southern Europe, Romania, and the Soviet Union numbered no less than 3.5 million. Stalin said that the majority of the people in Bulgaria and Southern Europe were of the same race as him, with 200,000 in the Bessarabia province of Romania alone. Although Germany's occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union's partition of Poland exceeded ethnic divisions, they all initially used ethnic arguments as a starting point. Given the complexity of the Balkan ethnicities, there is almost no time when this pretext cannot be used as a reason for attack.</p>
<p>As for the recent international background of the Balkans, let's analyze it with Germany as the center: (1) Germany's relationship with the Balkans is centered on economics. Originally, half of the food and raw materials that Germany needed to import, except for wool, cotton, rubber, coffee, etc., which the Balkans did not produce, were supplied by the Balkans. During this war, Britain and France intensified their blockade of Germany, and the degree of reliance naturally deepened. In addition, Germany also regards the Danube River basin as a shortcut directly to the Near East and the Middle East, threatening the channel for British and French forces in those areas. (2) Because of its abundant resources, Russia, whether under the Tsarist era or under Soviet rule, did not have close economic relations with the Balkans; but she has always regarded herself as the leader of the Slavic peoples. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, she helped her "compatriots" in southeastern Europe break free from the shackles of the Ottoman Empire. Even today, because of ethnic origins, it serves as a stepping stone for attracting the peasants and workers of countries such as Bulgaria and Southern Europe. On the whole, although there are nationalistic conflicts between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Balkans, they have not yet reached the stage of "direct conflict." Especially since the two countries concluded a non-aggression treaty, Germany, which is fighting Britain and France on the western frontier, must do its best to please the Soviet Union; the impact of this is that even the Hungarian government, which participated in the "Anti-Comintern Pact," and the Yugoslav and Bulgarian governments, which had always been anti-Soviet for twenty years, had to lay down their flags and silence their drums towards the Soviet Union. (3) The rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union and the rise of the Soviet Union in Europe have invisibly threatened another "axis" power, Italy. Mussolini's participation in the "axis" had a price: that is, Germany supported his development towards the Balkans; and the reasons why he attached importance to the Balkans were, firstly, that he used the Balkans as a source of food and raw materials, and secondly, in terms of military strategy: (A) to protect the Adriatic coast and its East African colonies, and (B) to regard Yugoslavia and Greece as its sphere of influence after occupying Albania. Italian-Soviet relations have always been bad. Now that Mussolini sees that his sphere of influence is in danger of being broken at any time, he is naturally uneasy.</p>
<p>A month ago, Rome's radio station and Mussolini's official newspaper repeatedly stated: "Italy will not allow the Bolshevik Soviet Union to cross the Carpathian Mountains and enter the Danube basin or the Balkans to peep into the Mediterranean!" "If the Communist Party hopes to expand its power in the Balkans, it will inevitably conflict with Mussolini's ideology and the Italian army!" Such a statement is by no means "empty threats"; but a look of eagerness to take action: according to information obtained by the French side.</p>
<p>Paris, 21st dispatch: "According to news received here today, on the 1st of this month, Italy decided to mobilize its 'Northern Army' and agreed with Yugoslavia to borrow its territory to enter Hungary to prevent Soviet activities in that area. Furthermore, if the Soviet Union takes offensive action against Romania, Italy is prepared to provide assistance to Romania, because its industry urgently needs crude oil supplied by Romania... After Germany learned of Italy's mobilization information and military plans at the beginning of this month, it urgently assured Italy that the Soviet Union would not launch an attack in southeastern Europe, because Italy's attitude was firm, and the Red Army's setbacks in the war against Finland meant that Moscow could not but be greatly affected in its attitude towards the Balkans."</p>
<p>It can be seen that the sharpness of Italian-Soviet opposition is increasing almost daily; and Germany, which is trying to use Italy and the Soviet Union to its advantage, does not want to see their sharpness become action; firstly, for fear that Italy and the Soviet Union will both be hurt and weaken Germany's power, and secondly, if Italy fights the Soviet Union, it will inevitably contact Turkey, Romania, and Greece; if these three countries combine with Italy, then although the front will be to deal with the Soviet Union, its side will be to approach Britain and France, which is to say that it will naturally become opposed to Germany. Germany is eager to mediate between Italy and the Soviet Union, and this is its difficulty. In mid-November, Romania launched an expanded Balkan consultation between Romania, Southern Europe, Greece, and Turkey to form a neutral Balkan group. Although Italy now declares that it does not consider this necessary, the initial clues clearly show that Italy is actively promoting its success; this is nothing more than to curb the expansion of Soviet power. Regarding this matter, the British and French public opinion circles believe that "if this group can be established, it would, if not a direct diplomatic victory for Britain and France, at least be a great gain," while Germany, at the request of the Soviet Union, is obstructing it. However, the factors of Italian-Soviet opposition cannot be eliminated. The Soviet Union is now at war with Finland. Whether it will use force to settle the old accounts of Bessarabia with Romania after the end of the war, and whether Italy will advance into Yugoslavia and Hungary to prevent the Soviet Union are all unpredictable. If they are actually seen in action in the future, then the European war will inevitably enter a broader stage.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in Northern Jiangsu Shows Signs of Wavering; Chinese Army Breaks into Xiannvmiao Town; No Trace of Japanese Troops in Funing County</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu: The Japanese army in northern Jiangsu has recently been subjected to counterattacks by various Chinese forces. Exhausted, they are showing signs of wavering: (1) The Japanese army in Baoying is being pressed by the Chinese army and has transported supplies from the city to Huxi. (2) The Japanese stronghold of Liujiabao was recaptured by the Chinese on the 20th. (3) The Japanese army at Xiannvmiao attempted an eastern invasion on the 19th but failed. On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese army launched a counterattack and broke into Xiannvmiao Town. The Japanese stubbornly defended their blockhouses and automatically burned the houses around the stronghold. The two sides are still in a stalemate. (4) After the recapture of Funing, the Chinese army continued to mop up the area for days. There is currently no trace of Japanese troops in the entire county. (5) Siyang was recovered. The Japanese infantry and artillery launched a joint counterattack on Siyang and encountered the Chinese on the 16th, fighting for three days and nights. They were finally surrounded by the Chinese in multiple layers, who defeated them, killing over a hundred Japanese (23rd dispatch).</p>
<h3>The Course of the National Army's Attack on Kaifeng</h3>
<p>Xuchang: The Chinese army that recently attacked Kaifeng in eastern Henan seized many spoils. The following is a summary of what occurred: A certain unit of the Chinese army advanced to Fengchenggang southwest of Kaifeng on the evening of the 16th and immediately launched an attack on Nanguan. They engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese troops at Heitun, Guotun, and Caitun. By 2 AM on the 17th, the Japanese had retreated one after another, and all of these areas were recaptured. The unit then pursued the remaining Japanese troops and approached Nanguan, recapturing areas near the vehicle target manufacturing plant, destroying all the Japanese-built fortifications, and burning all the ammunition, supplies, and other military supplies stored by the Japanese. They seized many spoils. Another unit simultaneously launched an attack on Xiguan in Kaifeng, occupying Xiguan after about an hour of fierce fighting with the Japanese. A unit took advantage of the victory to break into the city and engage in fierce street fighting with the Japanese. The Chinese plainclothes team that had infiltrated the city took the opportunity to respond, setting fires in the Songguan and Youguan streets and engaging in combat with the Japanese. At that time, the city gates of Kaifeng were filled with smoke and fire, and order was greatly disrupted. Fierce fighting continued until noon on the 17th (22nd dispatch).</p>
<h3>War Situation of the Week</h3>
<p>—From the 15th to the 21st—</p>
<p>Chongqing: The spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission stated that the battles on all fronts this week were more intense than last week. The soldiers of the Chinese army showed great bravery and repeatedly defeated the stubborn enemy on the northern and southern battlefields. Especially in the areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, and both sides of the Yangtze River, the scale of seizures and the number of recaptured areas were unprecedented in recent months. Therefore, the Japanese cheaply spread the rumor that China was adopting a "winter offensive" to conceal their decline and exhaustion. In fact, the Chinese army has not yet reached the stage of a full-scale offensive at this time, only monitoring the Japanese positions, holding the Japanese army in place, and not allowing them to have any spare time to draw troops for adjustment and rest. The following is a summary of the important war reports obtained by the Chinese army in recent days when opportunities arose to launch a fierce attack on key points.</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Guangxi Chinese army launched a joint attack on Nanning for days, first launching a large-scale fierce attack on the Japanese rearguard and thoroughly destroying the Qin-Yong highway, cutting off the Japanese reinforcement route. Following the recapture of Datang, Nama, Xiaodong, Tangbao, Dasi, and Niudong, the rear traffic of the Japanese was completely controlled by the Chinese in Luwu and Nali. Starting on the 17th, the Chinese army north of Nanning was further divided into two routes along the Yong-Wu and Yong-Bin roads to launch a large-scale fierce attack, sweeping through like a storm. Gaofengao, Gaoluling, and Xinwei on the Yong-Wu road, and Kunlun Pass, Jiutang, Qitang, Liutang, and Wutang, and Sitang on the Yong-Bin road were all recaptured one after another. The vanguard pressed close to Nanning, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties, were deeply besieged, and were in a position to be wiped out.</p>
<p>The Japanese army besieged in Nanchang in northern Jiangxi has been besieged by various Chinese forces for days, with over a thousand casualties. All the dozens of strongholds outside Nanchang's northwest Shahe, Huanglaomen, Zhanggongdu, Lehua, southeast Shuxi, Pengwu, Xishi, Longchang Bridge, Shangluo, Hushan, and Xiong, etc., fell into Chinese hands, and they once attacked the city and engaged in street fighting. Other units advanced eastward from Gaoan northeast, Fengxin, Wuning west, recapturing Gaoyou, Dacheng, Chitian, Zhanghou, and Zhujian, respectively approaching the Japanese core positions and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Countless weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies were seized.</p>
<p>Over the past week, the Hubei-Hunan Chinese army has taken the form of swift thunder and lightning, capturing key areas in the Hubei-Hunan border area such as Xintanpu, Banqiao, Jingshan, Yunxi, Zhonghuopu, and Yuanlipai, and dividing its forces to attack Tongcheng and Yueyang. The north gate of Tongcheng and the Yueyang railway station were once recaptured. Over six hundred Japanese were killed in the Zhonghuopu battle. The Japanese troops at Hesheng Bridge were attacked in southern Hubei, cutting off the Wu-Yue transportation route. Dozens of strongholds on both sides of the Xiang-E area in central Hubei, such as Duobaowan, Luohansi, Xiantao Town, and Luojiadoupi, were recaptured, cutting off the Beijing-Hankou and Xiang-Yue (Kou) and Xiang-Hua roads, and Zhongxiang was being besieged. They pressed close to the suburbs of Jingshan and Tianmen, directly attacking Suixian, Yingshan, and Anlu counties. In a week of bloody fighting, over three thousand Japanese were killed, and over twenty cannons and countless light and heavy machine guns and ammunition were seized.</p>
<p>The Chinese army that launched a fierce attack on Xinyang in southern Henan is currently surrounding the county seat on three sides and once broke into Changtaiguan and Huangjiayuan. The 3,000 troops of the puppet army of Peng Ziwen took the opportunity to mutiny and kill the Japanese. Pingjing and Wusheng passes are also under siege by the Chinese. Tongxu was captured in eastern Henan, the west gate of Kaifeng was occupied, and they broke into the city. The Japanese responded in a panic, with over six hundred casualties, and were extremely frightened.</p>
<p>In addition, they attacked Baotou in the Sui region, broke into Taiyuan in central Shanxi, recaptured Funing and Siyang in northern Jiangsu, forced Dongliu Guichi Jieling in southern Anhui, and broke into Hangzhou in western Zhejiang. Wherever their sharp edge reached, the Japanese army was terrified, trembling in fear, abandoning their armor and corpses, and fleeing in disarray. Most of those who automatically surrendered to the Chinese showed the decline of morale and the weakening of the combat effectiveness of the front-line units, which was almost completely revealed (22nd dispatch).</p>
<h3>Chen En-Yuan Appointed Mayor of Guilin</h3>
<p>Guilin: The provincial government is scheduled to be established in Guilin on New Year's Day and has appointed Chen En-yuan as mayor. The original Guilin County will be renamed Lingui County, and the county magistrate will continue to be Ryoichi Yamada (23rd dispatch).</p>
<h3>Six Hundred French Troops in Tianjin Will Return Home Next Week</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch: Of the original nine hundred French troops stationed in Tianjin, six hundred are scheduled to go to Thai Royal Island next Tuesday and return home via Shanghai and India. Also, the French military headquarters in Tianjin will soon move to Shanghai (23rd dispatch).</p>
<h3>Wu Zhongxin Expected to Arrive in Tibet Within the Year</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, was dispatched to Tibet to preside over the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. He set out from Chongqing last month. According to his accompanying secretary Zhou Kuntian's telegram to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Wu arrived in Yangon on the 23rd of last month, arrived in Calcutta on the 27th, arrived in Darjeeling on the 6th of this month, and arrived in Kalimpong on the 13th. The Indian government and Han and Tibetan overseas Chinese expressed a warm welcome. The Tibetan authorities have sent representatives to meet him along the way. Wu is scheduled to depart on the 19th, enter Tibet through Sikkim, and is expected to arrive within the year (23rd dispatch).</p>
<h3>Rumors that Hong Kong Will Leave the Sterling Area</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Rumors circulating in London that a new cabinet order continuing to restrict the remittance of pounds and declaring Hong Kong a non-sterling area has been or will soon be announced in Hong Kong have aroused speculation here. As of now, no such new order has been seen here, but it is expected that the order has been drafted and will soon be announced. At the same time, it has been learned from reliable sources that the order refers to an order from the Ministry of Finance that Hong Kong be listed in the area where British currency cannot be transferred. In practical terms, this order is intended to tighten existing regulations to prevent people from using Hong Kong as a clearing house for British funds to escape into China and other countries, because Hong Kong has always been able to purchase Chinese currency and then convert Chinese currency into other foreign currencies. Since Hong Kong is outside the sterling area, its trade relations with China will not be greatly affected. In this regard, Hong Kong's position is similar to that of Canada, but it is expected that restrictions on imports to Hong Kong from the sterling area will be handled leniently (23rd Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Tightening of the Blockade of Tianjin Concessions</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: External news: The Japanese side is scheduled to resume the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin starting on the 24th, and everything will be the same as before the flood. The Japanese military posts originally set up on Asahi Street were removed due to the flood, but are now scheduled to be restored at 8 AM on the 24th. The Japanese military headquarters has notified all parties (22nd dispatch).</p>
<h3>French Military Casualties in Combat - Less Than Two Thousand in the First Three Months</h3>
<p>Paris: French Prime Minister Daladier last night spoke in the House of Representatives about French casualties compared to 1914, saying that as of the end of November, French casualties were 1,136 in the army, 256 in the navy, and 42 in the air force, while in December 1914, France had 450,000 deaths. Ten French provinces have been invaded. The government does not currently approve of immature offensives and sporadic attacks along the entire line. We are in the early months of the war, and we are conducting the war in a systematic and rational manner (23rd Reuters dispatch).</p>

<h3>US Government Announces Intention Not to Impose a Ten Percent Tax on Japanese Goods; Whether Other Restrictions Will Be Implemented Remains Unknown; Hull and Horinouchi Discuss Treaty Issues</h3>
<p>Washington – The US government yesterday abandoned the use of economic punitive measures against Japan. The authorities announced that after the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty on January 26 of next year, the United States does not intend to invoke the import tax law of 1828. This law stipulates that all goods carried by Japanese and foreign ships must be subject to a 10% differential import tax. In 1872, President Grant declared the suspension of this law against Japan. Officials here stated today that five months after the US government announced the abolition of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty, upon its expiration next month, the 1828 law will remain suspended. US Customs Commissioner Hallett instructed customs officials yesterday to inform them of the government's new decision. Officials here are currently refusing to comment on whether the government will take other punitive measures against Japan after the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty. At the same time, State Department officials and members of Congress are also refusing to comment on US-Japan relations, as they all intend to wait quietly for the expiration of the treaty and the presentation of the proposal to ban the export of fuel materials to Japan when the next Congress convenes. Some officials claim that they know nothing about possible developments in the Far East, while others say that they are waiting for the situation to develop and do not want to comment on everything in advance. Most of the members of Congress who criticize US-Japan relations are known to be unfriendly towards Japan, because they are dissatisfied with Japan's invasion of China and its attacks on American interests and expatriates in China. Republican Congressman Pettigrew stated that he believes the US government should not renegotiate a commercial treaty with Japan, because "entering into contracts with aggressive countries does not bring any benefit, but is harmful. At the very least, if we refuse to trade with Japan, we will not contribute to the failure of other countries. We cannot determine the policies of Japan and other countries, but at the very least, we must refuse to deal with Japan until Japan can comply with the principles of improving relations with other countries. We also have the right to decide whether any country's behavior is necessary to promote relations with that country." He refuted Japan's past interpretations of the 1911 commercial treaty, saying, "This is Japan's strategy to facilitate its own interests and completely violates the rights we have obtained under the treaty. We have not yet obtained other guarantees that the Japanese government will be able to fulfill all its promises after the new treaty is signed, let alone fulfill the old ones." The Department of Commerce announced that the US Commercial Attaché in Japan reported that Japanese business and banking circles are still afraid of the evolution of the international situation, the difficulty of navigation in the European war zone, and the Japanese government's tightening control over Japanese economic behavior. Therefore, Japanese market prices have fallen in the past week. It is believed here that the US government's continuation of President Grant's declaration should not be regarded as a major concession to Japan, because the United States can still use other economic methods to punish Japan. Some observers believe that the government's decision reflects that the resolution of pending issues between Japan and the United States can thus be further advanced. State Department officials and other government authorities do not endorse the optimistic remarks made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tokyo yesterday, but it is generally believed that US-Japan trade will continue to proceed according to the current methods until Japan can accept most of the US demands. After the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty, the US government is free to use any necessary economic retaliatory measures to deal with Japan. Secretary of State Hull refused to comment on the Tokyo talks yesterday. The Department of Commerce announced yesterday that, in accordance with President Grant's declaration, the United States does not intend to levy discriminatory tonnage taxes on Japan after the expiration of the commercial treaty.

<p>Tokyo – Regarding the news of the meeting between US Ambassador Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura yesterday, the information transmitted by the Japanese side is contradictory. According to a report by the Japan News Agency, Grew told Nomura that the United States was "very pleased" with Japan's opening of the Yangtze River and that the United States would reciprocate with "friendly actions." The US government will take this opportunity to allow US-Japan trade relations to continue. However, according to the "Asahi Shimbun," Grew did not give a direct answer to Nomura's question about what attitude the United States would take towards US-Japan trade relations. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to authoritative sources here, US Ambassador Grew guaranteed Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura that the United States would maintain US-Japan trade relations after the US-Japan commercial treaty is canceled next month, but did not mention specific actions or methods. Grew's words were in response to Nomura's inquiry. Nomura had asked Grew to briefly state the US attitude towards this matter before Christmas, and the Japanese wanted to obtain guarantees before the opening of Congress and to give Japanese business circles a guarantee before the New Year holiday. Grew refused to answer Nomura's questions directly and specifically at the time. Japanese newspapers today published very optimistic reports about the talks between Grew and Nomura, and the stock and securities markets have soared. Well-informed sources believe that this talk has paved the way for formal US-Japan meetings, and all obstacles have been removed. In this talk with the United States, the Japanese used the American psychology towards Christmas, constantly mentioning the spirit of Christmas, etc. In 1937, Japan resolved the issue of compensation for the US warship "Panay" by taking advantage of this season.

<p>Washington – Treasury Department Customs Commissioner Harris told a group of reporters today that President Roosevelt intends to continue to exclude Japan from President Grant's 1872 proclamation (the clause on levying taxes on foreign goods imported into the United States by foreign ships), so a 10% differential tariff is unlikely to be imposed on Japanese goods. (Daimai dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington – The US Treasury Department notified all US customs offices on the 22nd that even after the US-Japan commercial treaty expires on January 26, they should temporarily refrain from levying a 10% differential tariff on Japanese goods. (Daimai dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington – Ambassador Horinouchi to the United States met with Undersecretary of State Welles at 3:00 PM on the 22nd, and then met with Secretary of State Hull at 3:30 PM. Ambassador Horinouchi supplemented the content explained by Foreign Minister Nomura during his third meeting with US Ambassador Grew in Japan, and also mentioned the content of the fourth meeting, and said that Japan is making various efforts to adjust US-Japan relations, hoping that the United States will also show a corresponding attitude. Hull replied that the United States understood Japan's intention, but the US hopes to negotiate in the Tokyo talks. The two also exchanged views on the US-Japan commercial treaty issue, and the meeting ended in a very peaceful atmosphere. (Daimai dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – US Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday when he met with newspaper reporters that the Japanese side's widely rumored preliminary understanding between the United States and Japan lacks an optimistic attitude on the part of the United States. Hull refused to comment on the Tokyo news that there would be no treaty-less state after the US-Japan commercial treaty expires in January 1940, but well-informed sources believe that US-Japan negotiations have not yet reached this stage. It is generally pointed out here that one of the main conditions for the United States to sign a new commercial treaty with Japan is to compensate American people for the losses they have suffered due to Japan's invasion of China and to recognize the equal status of American trade with China.

<h3>Japan and the Soviet Union Begin Discussions on Trade Issues</h3>
<p>Moscow – Ambassador Togo visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Mikoyan at 5:00 PM on the 22nd for the first meeting to discuss Japan-Soviet trade issues. Since this meeting was the first meeting between the representatives of both parties, they only exchanged views on general issues and did not discuss specific matters. The two agreed to meet again within the year to continue negotiations. (Daimai dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Granted Audience with the Emperor</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura today had an audience with the Emperor to report on the state of Japanese diplomacy, especially regarding his talks with US Ambassador Grew and the recent developments in Soviet-Japanese negotiations. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The House of Representatives convened today, opening at 11:35 AM. First, Speaker Oyama stood up and announced that the 75th Imperial Diet was convened today, and introduced the new members of Parliament: Suehiro Nishio, Ryogoro Kato, Yoshizo Yoshikawa, Eisaku Ota, Toyokazu Ishizaka, Yoshi Murakami, Keitaro Kitaura, and Motoichi Yoshida. Next, Kinmitsu Tsuneo was elected as the Deputy Speaker after being appointed as the Minister of Colonial Affairs. The results of the ballot determined that Kazumin Tago (Seiyukai) was elected. Speaker Oyama immediately announced that he would immediately report to His Majesty the Emperor through the Prime Minister to obtain approval. The meeting adjourned at 12:32 PM. (Daimai dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing – People in China are paying great attention to the opening of the current session of the Japanese Parliament in Tokyo this morning. Several well-known Chinese newspapers have published commentaries on it today. The Central Daily News reported that the major issues facing the Japanese Parliament are how to adjust relations between Japan and the United States and between Japan and the Soviet Union, because the US-Japan commercial treaty will expire in a month. Japan has announced that it will open the Yangtze River within two months in order to induce the United States to renew the new treaty. However, according to the newspaper, Japan's attempt to adjust its relations with the United States and the Soviet Union will be doomed to failure. The future of the current session of Parliament is expected to be very bleak. The "Sweeping" newspaper, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Army, also commented on the matter, saying that although Prime Minister Abe is working hard to seek the assistance of political parties and the press, his cabinet is unlikely to last. The newspaper concluded that Japan's difficulties have now reached a point where they cannot be resolved, so the Abe cabinet will fail. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Most of the evening newspapers here today published reports on the opening of the Japanese Parliament and the news from New York that the United States would not implement punitive tariffs against Japan. There is also optimism here about US-Japan relations, but the Kokumin Shimbun stated that Japan's opening of the Yangtze River is actually a loss greater than the gain. If this move by Japan still fails to obtain a definite trade relationship, Japan will be greatly disappointed. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Diplomatic Activities in France</h3>
<p>Paris – People here are very happy about the resolution of the "Japanese Gold Loan" issue, which has been pending between France and Japan for ten years, and consider it a sign of the adjustment of relations between France and Japan. According to the new Japanese Ambassador to France, Sawada, an agreement has been reached with the French side on the issue of repaying the 5% French bonds borrowed by Japan in 1912. In addition, the issue to be resolved between France and Japan is the transportation of military supplies to China via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. However, according to the French side, France has not allowed the import of military supplies into China from Annam. The rumors are nothing more than propaganda created by the German propaganda department in an attempt to worsen French-Japanese relations in order to facilitate the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan. In addition, some people here believe that the changes in US-Soviet relations have a great impact, because if the United States severs diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, it will greatly help Britain and France in their attitude towards the Soviet Union and Germany.

<h3>Earthquake Occurs in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>The Hague – An earthquake occurred in the Dutch East Indies archipelago today. It was very strong. Thirty houses were destroyed in Gagaks Town, and 108 houses were destroyed in Lolapan Town, and a bridge was destroyed, but there were no casualties in any of the areas. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>US Plans to Build Large Warships; British Experts Observe That It Will Not Be Easy to Realize</h3>
<p>London – British naval experts view the news that the US House Naval Subcommittee has ridiculed the Navy Department's proposed budget for building 65,000-ton battleships as something that will not be easy to realize. The reaction in British naval circles is "to add new ships with all our strength, but smaller ones rather than larger ones." According to key sources, this war has proved the need for smaller battleships. Although they do not approve of building battleships over 40,000 tons, they also point out the various shortcomings of German pocket battleships, the biggest of which is that the gun emplacements are too heavy and do not match their displacement. German naval architects conducted long-term trials and installed more gun emplacements in a certain displacement, exceeding what was actually possible. In fact, this type of trial has never proven successful, and it is a mistake to have more than three or four gun turrets on one ship. This can be seen from the fact that the "Spee" was completely destroyed by a single shell. In addition, the construction cost of a 65,000-ton battleship is also too high. The estimated cost of shipbuilding in the UK is £219 per ton, while in the US the cost is about £400. The cost of building an 80,000-ton battleship in the US would be £32 million. The US may not jump from a 40,000-ton battleship to a 65,000-ton or 80,000-ton battleship. The Americans must not have forgotten the Panama Canal. When the British battleship "Nelson" passed through the Panama Canal, the river bank was only 18 inches away from the ship, and it took great difficulty to pass through. Therefore, the statement that the United States will build 65,000-ton or 80,000-ton battleships is not worth taking seriously. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Germany's Barter Agreements with South American Countries Cannot Be Fulfilled Due to the War, Causing Major Economic Damage</h3>
<p>Argentina – The barter agreement signed between Germany and Argentina in March of this year has now been affected by the war and cannot be fulfilled. According to this agreement, Germany must supply Argentina with 64 "diesel" engine locomotives, 900 freight cars, 40 sleeping cars, and a number of oil tankers. As for Argentina, it should submit 100,000 tons of barley, 8,000 tons of wool, and various other products to Germany. The total value of the goods exchanged by both parties is US$3,640,000. Argentina has delivered half of the goods agreed upon, and 100,000 tons of barley were delivered to Germany before the outbreak of the war. However, the goods delivered by Germany to Argentina, such as railway vehicles, only accounted for a part. Germany promised to submit the remaining parts in 1940 and 1941, but since the outbreak of the war, Germany's merchant fleet has disappeared at sea, so the goods it promised to submit have not arrived here. Although the German Ambassador to Argentina, Dellmann, has expressed to the Argentine government that Germany is determined to seek the fulfillment of the agreement, there is very little hope for this here. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways has now decided to order vehicles from other countries. According to the Ministry of Railways, 200 oil tankers have been ordered from the United States at a value of US$500,000. In addition, ten streamlined "diesel" engine trains, each with three cars, and seven "diesel" motorcycles have been ordered from Hungary. According to informed sources here, even if Germany is willing to fulfill the contract, there are in fact many difficulties, because after Germany has been blockaded by Britain and France, goods from the outside world can no longer reach Germany, and Germany's goods can no longer be exported. It is said that barter agreements signed between other South American countries and Germany have also been suspended in the same way. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Britain Continues to Order Aircraft from the US, Worth 48 Million Dollars</h3>

<h3>Soviet Troops Launch Counterattack in Severe Cold, Recapturing Important Northern Towns; Soviet Isolated Troops Gain a Lesson; General Menacing's Strategy Succeeds</h3>
<p>The Hague – According to reliable sources in Finland, the retreat of Soviet troops on the northern front in Finland has been confirmed by people in Sweden and Norway. The vanguard of the Red Army had reached the town of Hohenjervi, but its main force had not yet reached the town of Salmijervi, resulting in isolated troops being deep inside enemy territory, with weak strength and unable to maintain the rear communication lines. At that time, the Finnish army had been replenished and immediately launched a large-scale counterattack. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Red Army finally collapsed and retreated towards the towns of Bigajervi and Salmijervi in disarray, abandoning a large number of military supplies. If they continue to retreat, they will end up in the port of Pechanga. According to the latest news, the town of Bigajervi has also been recaptured by the Finnish army. The Finnish army ski team has repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the Red Army. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen – According to news obtained here last night, Soviet troops in the far north of Finland are still retreating. Finnish troops are currently intensifying their offensive with cautious movements. The Soviet troops in the area initially retreated in an orderly manner, but soon abandoned military equipment along the way and fled in panic. Last night, they were 20 to 30 kilometers away from the positions they occupied on Wednesday. They apparently want to retreat to the town of Kola on the Murmansk Railway, rather than return to the port of Pechanga, where they landed. The strategy adopted by Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim is gradually succeeding. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Yesterday, Finnish troops on the northeastern front launched a victorious attack, and Soviet troops continued to retreat. According to news from the Norwegian border, the Red Army in the Pechanga corridor is rapidly retreating. Many tanks and military equipment frozen in the severe cold have been abandoned along the way. It is believed that more soldiers died from the severe cold than in battle. Are the northern Soviet troops planning to abandon winter warfare or will they suspend operations until the weather improves before launching an offensive? People here are speculating about this. According to responsible sources, the Finnish counterattack on the Salla front is a "victory that determines the future of the war." (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London – The "Daily Express" correspondent in The Hague recently wired that according to reliable sources, the Soviet military authorities have decided to stop attacking Finland and will launch an offensive again next spring. Military experts from neutral countries stationed in Finland said that the Red Army should dig trenches and hold its ground in the occupied areas, waiting until the weather is fine in the spring before launching an offensive.

<h3>Soviet Union Admits Difficulties in Fighting Against Finland</h3>
<p>Mannerheim Line Comparable to Siegfried Line; Rugged Terrain and Dense Lakes and Swamps Form Natural Protection; Says Soviet Military Achievements are Already Better than Britain and France</p>
<p>Moscow – Regarding the situation of the Soviet-Finnish war in the past three weeks, the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District recently issued the following communique: "In summary of the war situation in the past three weeks, we should admit that the Soviet army has achieved important victories: (1) In northern Finland, after occupying the port of Pechanga on December 1, the Soviet army penetrated 130 kilometers into Finnish territory. If calculated from the coast of the Barents Sea, the Soviet army progressed 6 kilometers per day. (2) In the Uuri Fortress area, the Soviet army has advanced 150 kilometers, averaging 7.5 kilometers per day. On the Vammelsuu Line, the Red Army has advanced 64 kilometers from its own border, averaging 3.2 kilometers per day. (3) In the direction of West Taipale, the Soviet army has advanced 80 kilometers, averaging 4 kilometers per day.</p>
<p>In total, on all fronts, the Soviet army captured 18 Finnish officers, 105 junior officers, and 1,302 soldiers. At the same time, it obtained a large number of spoils of war, including 35 artillery pieces, 300 machine guns, 3,000 rifles, 11 mortars, 220 hand grenade launchers, and 7 armored vehicles. The Soviet side suffered 1,823 deaths and 7,000 injuries. As for the Finnish side, 2,200 corpses have been found in the areas occupied by the Soviet army, and those killed by Soviet artillery fire are not included. According to headquarters statistics, there are 10,000 Finnish wounded.</p>
<p>In fact, the terrain of Finland is extremely difficult for our army to advance. The lack of roads, the rugged terrain, the abundance of forests and lakes, and the solid artillery and machine gun positions are all obstacles to the rapid advance of the Soviet Red Army.</p>
<p>Finland has been building this fortification for four years, with the help of three foreign countries, and these three countries are attempting to increase their influence in Finland in order to use it as a base for attacking Leningrad and Moscow. In terms of resistance, this man-made fortification (such as in the Karelian Isthmus), supplemented by natural protection, is no less strong than the Siegfried Line on the Western Front. Britain and France have been fighting on the Siegfried Line for four months without any progress.</p>
<p>The Red Army is very aware of these difficulties, so it never expected to eliminate the Finnish army with a surprising blow. It is clearly ignorant or deliberately slandering the Soviet army to blame the Red Army leaders for failing to eliminate the Finnish army within a week. The Karelian Isthmus is the most difficult area to capture. The defenses there, from Lake Ladoga to the Gulf of Finland near Viipuri, have extremely strong fortifications, but the Soviet army is still advancing 3.2 kilometers per day in that direction. At the same time, the main Finnish line of defense, the "Mannerheim Line," has been broken through by the Soviet army.</p>
<p>If we compare the extent of the Red Army's progress on the Mannerheim Line with the progress of the British and French armies on the Siegfried Line, then we must admit that the Soviet army has achieved important success, while the British and French armies have completely failed.</p>
<p>What is the extent of the progress of the British and French armies in the past four months in attempting to attack the Germans on the Siegfried Line? Why do foreign newspapers not pay attention to it? Is it not because the progress of the British and French armies is too short to be estimated in kilometers or meters and must be calculated in centimeters? (Tass dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Finnish War Report</h3>
<p>Finnish Capital: The General Headquarters issued a war report stating: (1) On the Karelian Isthmus front, Soviet troops, still aiming at the cities of Koivisto and Muolaanjärvi, launched all-day attacks on our positions under the cover of artillery fire, supported by tanks and aircraft, but were all repelled by our forces. (2) In the Taipale River area, the Red Army attempted to break through our lines but failed and suffered heavy losses, with seven tanks destroyed by our forces. (3) On the eastern front, the Red Army attacked the town of Videla, but was immediately repelled by our forces. Fierce fighting occurred between the two armies in the city of Aklajaervi. (4) Only small-scale skirmishes occurred between Lifsa and Raipola, with the Red Army losing one tank. (5) On the northern front, in the area of Salla, our counterattack was quite successful, destroying ten Soviet tanks. (6) In the Petsamo port area, the two sides' forces are still engaged in fierce fighting. Intense explosions were reportedly heard in the Petsamo nickel mining area, likely caused by the Red Army during their retreat. (7) Soviet aircraft remained very active today, flying to our capital amidst heavy snowfall and dropping fifteen bombs, all of which missed their targets. There were no casualties on our side. Eleven enemy planes were shot down by our forces, and another five were forced to land. Finnish aircraft were also very active, engaging enemy aircraft and flying over the Soviet Leningrad area to distribute leaflets, informing the Soviet people about the inside story of the Finnish-Soviet war.

<h3>Sinking of the "October Revolution" Ship – Soviet Denial</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to Reuters and Havas reports, the Soviet giant ship "October Revolution" has been sunk by Finnish artillery. The Soviet Baltic Headquarters has denied this, declaring the report a fabricated piece of utter nonsense. (TASS dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Prepare to Substantially Assist Finland, with Special Consideration for the Position of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway</h3>
<p>Paris: The cabinet held a state council meeting this morning and received a report on the diplomatic and military situation. It was stated that the Finnish army's resistance to the Soviet invasion has achieved significant victories, with Soviet forces routed in several areas. Relevant countries are now preparing to assist Finland. The cabinet members expressed satisfaction upon hearing this. (Havas Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: French Prime Minister Daladier, amid cheers in the Chamber of Deputies last night, spoke of Finland's war of resistance against the Soviet Union, saying that merely praising the loyalty and bravery of the Finnish people would not suffice; we must help them. The League of Nations has already condemned the Soviet Union, and we have exercised all our responsibilities in a united form. We will continue to do so in the future. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the issue of assisting Finland's war of resistance, diplomatic circles here anticipate that Britain and France will actively exchange views with the Scandinavian countries in the coming days, as preventing Soviet troops from penetrating deep into Finnish territory is extremely important for both Britain and France and for Europe as a whole. According to reliable sources from the Scandinavian countries, each country is genuinely sincere in assisting Finland, but the issue is not simple. In short, if these countries openly provide as much assistance as possible to Finland, their own strength will inevitably be weakened. As a result, they will become more vulnerable to the covetousness of Germany and the Soviet Union. Therefore, what these countries urgently want to know is whether they will receive sufficient assistance to protect themselves if they are invaded by Germany and Italy in the future. Britain and France believe that these concerns are fully justified, and while providing as much assistance as possible to Finland, they are also carefully studying how to safeguard the Scandinavian countries. In short, the British and French governments will task experts with investigating the military and practical assistance that can be provided to Finland, ensuring that this assistance is effective, and then negotiating with the Scandinavian countries based on the results of this investigation. (Havas Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Swedish Volunteers Depart to Assist Finland</h3>
<p>Stockholm: This afternoon, the second unit of Swedish volunteers departed for Finland by special train. Many relatives and friends went to the station to see them off. Their attitude was solemn, and their spirits were high, truly embodying the spirit of volunteering for military service. The commander of this unit is Lieutenant Colonel Dillson, who has served in the Swedish military for many years. This time, he acted righteously, resigned from his official position, and led the volunteers to assist Finland. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Finnish Capital: The first batch of 1,500 Swedish volunteers to assist Finland has arrived in Finland. Finnish military representatives warmly welcomed them. It is reported that the volunteers are equipped with excellent and superior military equipment. Each person wears a steel helmet, and the style of their uniforms is exactly the same as the Finnish military uniforms. Each also carries a gas mask. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Navy Plans to Protect Fishing Vessels; Three British Ships Lost in One Day; Swedish Ship Sunk by Mine</h3>
<p>London: Reuters naval correspondent reports that a plan to protect British fishing fleets is being prepared and will likely be implemented soon. Its nature has not yet been disclosed, and now is an excellent time to prepare the necessary arrangements, as British fishing boats traditionally stay in port for Christmas, while Scottish fishing boats take a New Year's holiday. It is believed here that the main motive for Germany's attacks on British fishing boats is to retaliate for the loss of the German pocket battleship Spee. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The British fishing boat "Tromio" was sunk last night off the coast of Yorkshire by the Italian national ship "Valentino." All the crew members, totaling fifteen, have been rescued and have landed at a port in northeastern England. It is reported that this fishing boat was spotted by a German plane on the 17th of this month while sailing to Hull. The plane immediately dropped several bombs, but they missed. The German plane then flew low and strafed with machine guns, but all the crew members were safe. (Havas Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: The British oil tanker "Oceana" (8,000 tons) struck a mine in a certain sea area and was damaged, but was still able to reach a port in this country for repairs. The crew members are all safe. (Havas Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: Today, London admitted that three British ships were lost yesterday. The "Greyfield," with a displacement of 4,434 tons, was severely damaged by a mine off the northeast coast of England. The "Captain," with a displacement of 1,562 tons, ran aground and split apart on the south coast of England.

<p>Amsterdam: According to London sources, a British ship ran aground and sank yesterday morning. Seventeen survivors have landed at an English port on the south coast of England. The ship's name has not been released. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: According to a newspaper report from London, a British reconnaissance plane spotted six sailors from the Swedish ship "Listhau" adrift at sea on a raft and rescued them. The "Listhau" had a displacement of 1,362 tons. The cause of its sinking is unknown. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: The Dutch ship "Mark," which sank in the Skagerrak Strait on September 9, has been investigated by the local maritime court. The investigation was completed yesterday, proving that the ship sank due to a mine explosion. The court also reprimanded the captain for choosing the safe route of the Kiel Canal. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: The Danish cargo ship "Jegersborg," 1,975 tons, sailed from Denmark to Scotland on the 14th of this month and has not been heard from since. It is likely to have been lost. The crew members, totaling eighteen, and their families have been notified. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: The British oil tanker Dorchnia struck a mine near the east coast of England and was severely damaged. It was subsequently rescued and sent to an unnamed British port. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>German Submarine Commander Discusses Past Experiences</h3>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday's broadcast speech by German submarine commander Schulz attracted the attention of all listeners. Schulz elaborated on his experiences of sinking 80,000 tons of enemy cargo in three expeditions, and stated that the fighting spirit of the submarine sailors was excellent. As soon as one danger passed, they would venture into another. On one occasion, after sinking a giant cargo ship, enemy aircraft dropped bombs one after another. The submarine was forced to submerge, and several destroyers pursued closely. It could only dive deep to avoid them. It was not until late at night, when it was impossible to distinguish objects, that it resurfaced. If enemy ships were seen attacking from all sides, it had to open up its speed and break through the encirclement. Schulz specifically mentioned the British Secretary of the Navy's statement in the House of Commons that Schulz had been captured, and sarcastically told the audience, "Now that I am broadcasting publicly, you all know whether the British Secretary of the Navy's words are credible. I need not elaborate." (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>British and French Military Leaders Insist on the Belief in Victory – Issue Christmas Greetings – Overcoming Hardships Depends on the Entire Nation as a Backing</h3>
<p>London: Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin sent Christmas greetings to the British army today, briefly discussing the celebration of Christmas in support of the future. Our efforts in this war are to create the future. Our courage is unconquerable, so this future should be the future we want. British Expeditionary Force Commander Lord Gort also sent a telegram to the people of the British Empire, briefly stating that the British Expeditionary Force is spending Christmas in France again, and is again fighting alongside the Allied forces under the command of the French general to resist aggression. In the coming year, hardships and dangers will inevitably occur, as in previous wars, but with the close understanding that exists today between Britain and France, and the nation's constant concern for the Expeditionary Force, any hardship can be overcome. Domestic Fleet Commander Forbes also issued a Christmas greeting to the people today, saying that victory is not easy to achieve, but I deeply know the support of the nation, so please believe that those of us who board ships and go to sea will definitely fulfill our future responsibilities. Air Force Chief of Staff Newall also issued greetings, saying that although the times have changed this year, the spirit of Christmas remains unchanged. Wherever the British Air Force soldiers are stationed, their aims are the same at this time, believing in certain victory. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>German Official Criticizes French Yellow Book – Claims It Contains Factual Errors</h3>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the French Foreign Ministry's yellow book, released yesterday, which describes the events before the outbreak of the war, German officials today made the following comments: "The French government hesitated until yesterday to release the yellow book, confirming that Britain and France should bear the responsibility for the outbreak of the war. Regardless of whether the documents it has collected are incomplete, they are sufficient to prove that the Allied countries did not prevent Poland from falling into the abyss. The Polish spirit of aggression and suppression of German actions were deliberately tolerated by Britain and France. There are several factual errors in the yellow book that German officials must point out. First, the yellow book claims that when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited Paris in December 1938, he said that after returning to Berlin, he would raise the issue of guaranteeing Czechoslovakia's integrity. In fact, when French Foreign Minister Bonnet raised this issue at the time, the German Foreign Minister replied that discussing this issue would immediately disrupt French-German relations. Secondly, the yellow book's account of Czech President Hacha's visit to Berlin in 1938 is entirely inaccurate speculation. In fact, because Britain and France were determined to go to war, they regarded Germany's compromise proposal to Poland as dangerous. Britain and France claimed to have intervened with Warsaw, advising it to negotiate directly. However, France's true intentions can be seen in the document submitted by the French Ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, to the French government. The document stated that if Polish Foreign Minister Beck came to Berlin, it would be "extremely inconvenient" because Germany would gain "a great spiritual victory." Germany's final proposal to Poland, the so-called sixteen-point proposal, was explained to the British Ambassador to Germany on the evening of August 30. After the German radio station broadcast it to the world on the 32nd, the Polish radio station rejected it that day at 11:00, considering it unacceptable. The French yellow book says that what Poland rejected was the proposal of August 29, not the sixteen points of August 31. In fact, the Polish broadcast opened by saying, 'Today, we have learned the true purpose of German policy from the German official gazette,' and then listed the sixteen points. The commentary published by the Polish Press Agency that evening was also directed at the sixteen points, proving that Poland rejected Germany's final proposal because Poland believed that the Allied countries did not want Germany to gain a 'spiritual victory.'"

<h3>The German People Can Only Survive Through Struggle – Celebrate Christmas and Support the Leader – Goebbels Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech at a Christmas gathering last night, attended by hundreds of Germans repatriated from the Baltic countries and evacuated from the Saar region. Goebbels declared that we must either relinquish our great power or win the war; one of the two must be the case. The German people will never abandon their leader. Germany will celebrate this Christmas with the deep confidence that is essential for victory. Goebbels continued to speak about the repatriation of German expatriates, saying that he deeply understood the suffering of the repatriated expatriates, but that suffering was unavoidable during this period. Today, no one in Germany is not experiencing hardship. Germany's survival is now in danger. If British and French politicians wanted the world to believe in the first few weeks of this war that they were fighting against Hitlerism and did not want to harm the German people, then today everyone knows that the purpose of Britain and France is to strike at the homes of the German people. It is not really important to know who is the head of the enemy. The most important thing is that we are now at war. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>German Train Accidents – Two Occur in One Day – Due to Crowded Travelers During the Christmas Holiday – More Than 300 Killed and Injured in Two Train Collisions</h3>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday morning, the express train from Berlin to Cologne collided with another train at Gentin railway station, killing 132 people and injuring 109. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: At about 10:00 last night, a passenger train collided with a freight train on the railway between Friedrichshafen and Radolfzell, killing 30 people and injuring more than 40. The stationmasters near the scene of the accident have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: According to sources here, Germans planning to leave home to spend Christmas elsewhere were shocked by the news that two express trains had crashed in the Jensen area southwest of Berlin yesterday. The German authorities were unwilling to disclose the news of the train collision in German newspapers, but they were unable to hide the news. The authorities are currently conducting an investigation and have reportedly arrested several people. German railways have repeatedly had accidents, leading to speculation that someone is sabotaging them. It is reported that several trains carrying ammunition were parked very close to the site of yesterday's train collision. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: According to sources here, two express trains collided between Berlin and Brandenburg yesterday, killing 70 people and injuring more than 100. This tragedy is the eighth accident on German railways since November. It is estimated that 210 people have died and 257 have been injured on German railways since the start of the war. This series of serious accidents reminds people of the important responsibility that trains bear in wartime, and this responsibility is especially important in belligerent countries that rely entirely on land transport. British transport does not rely entirely on land, but great efforts are also made on the railways during wartime. This can be seen from the fact that 1,500 special trains were used to transport evacuees away from London in less than 36 hours. According to the official gazette published today, in the first three months of the war, British railways ran 5,500 special trains to carry troops and ammunition, and 50,000 specially made trains to carry heavy and large objects, such as artillery and iron plates. However, British railways are running smoothly, and to ensure ample convenience in the future, the Ministry of Transport has recently ordered 10,000 covered freight cars, each weighing 21 tons. Germany's railways are in a more unfortunate position, as indicated by the repeated accidents. The reason is that the tracks and vehicles are mostly old, and the number of railway workers has decreased, while those who remain are working too long. It is reported that they work an average of more than 12 hours a day, and there is also a shortage of freight cars, which further increases the difficulties. All countries bordering Germany know of the extreme shortage of German freight cars. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Bern: In recent times, there have been frequent accidents on German railways. The German semi-official agency, the German News Agency, recently issued a message stating that at 9:00 last night, two more passenger trains collided between the stations of Matherdorf and Klufften, killing 30 passengers and injuring 40. The stationmasters of each station have been detained by the authorities for investigation. (Havas Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Uruguay's Rebuttal: Germany's Protest</h3>
<p>The capital of Uruguay: Regarding the self-sinking of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," the German envoy, Mr. Lagermann, had lodged a protest with the Uruguayan government, claiming that the Uruguayan government only allowed the ship to anchor in the port of Montevideo for 72 hours, and the ship was unable to be repaired, thus it should not have been allowed to sink itself, etc. The Uruguayan Foreign Minister, Mr. Guani, recently issued a reply refuting this, stating briefly that, according to the Hague International Convention, warships of belligerent nations are allowed to stay in neutral ports for 24 hours. The 1928 Havana Pan-American Convention stipulated that this time limit could be extended, but only if the damage suffered by the belligerent warship was due to adverse weather conditions. Since the damage suffered by the "Admiral Graf Spee" was the result of combat, the Uruguayan government allowed it to stay in the port of Montevideo for 72 hours, which was entirely in accordance with the law.

<h3>The Activity of the Chinese Air Force in Guangdong: Destroying Japanese Camps and Warehouses; Statistics on Japanese Air Raids Last Month</h3>
<p>Shaoguan correspondence: The Chinese Air Force has been actively bombing Japanese military camps, forts, and airfields in the East, West, and North River areas of Guangdong Province in recent days, achieving significant results. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>East River: According to air force sources, a squadron of the air force, including several heavy bombers, escorted by fighter planes and equipped with a large number of bombs, took off from a certain location on the morning of the 7th and flew directly to the East River area. When they arrived over the Humen area, the Japanese forces began to notice them and fled in panic. The Chinese squadron then unleashed its power along the Shatou-Taiping Highway, repeatedly bombing the Humen military district's Ugaisquadron headquarters in Taiping and the Japanese air force supply station at the Shatou airfield, dropping more than 20 heavy bombs, most of which hit their targets. The thunderous sounds shook the heavens and the earth. Although the Japanese forces hastily opened fire with machine guns and anti-aircraft guns, they were unable to resist. More than 50 Japanese soldiers in the camp were killed, and countless amounts of aviation fuel, bombs, and military supplies stored at the Shatou airfield were destroyed. The Shatou airfield, which was in close contact with the Japanese Iijimasquadron, caught fire after the bombing, with black flames reaching the sky, making it impossible to approach. The Chinese squadron safely returned to base after completing its mission.</p>
<p>West River: Since repeatedly attacking Lupu, Huangtang, Jitang, and other places, the Japanese forces in Sanshui have been dormant and dared not move. A group of engineers, numbering about 700 to 800, are rushing to build fortifications in the suburbs and outer defenses. A squadron of the Chinese Air Force's "Condor" team of several aircraft took off from a certain location at 12:00 noon on the 6th and attacked the Kou River area of Sanshui. When they flew over the Japanese position, the Japanese soldiers scattered and fled. The engineers building fortifications abandoned their equipment and fled for their lives, creating a chaotic scene. The Chinese aircraft circled several times and then flew low, dropping seven or eight bombs and two incendiary bombs, causing a fiery blaze that engulfed more than ten Japanese camps. The built gun emplacements, machine gun bunkers, and various defensive works were also completely destroyed, killing and wounding about 40 Japanese and puppet soldiers and sinking three boats with about 50 engineers.</p>
<p>North River: With the outbreak of war in northern Guangdong in recent days, the Japanese forces have continued to harass the north, with a large increase in Japanese and puppet troops near Juntian, Yinzhan'ao, and other places. The Japanese military transportation has been extremely busy in various places in recent days. Troops have been increased in Longtang, Shixia, Shiling, and Shihu, totaling more than 4,000 people this week. In order to eliminate their main combat force, the Chinese army dispatched large squadrons of aircraft to bomb Japanese military camps, food depots, and ammunition depots in military areas on the mornings and afternoons of the 9th. Ten Chinese aircraft in the morning and eighteen in the afternoon bombed Japanese fortresses and positions near Longtang, Shixia, Juntian, Shihu, Shiling, Yingzui, and south of Tuzishan, causing heavy losses to the Japanese.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Japanese landed in Qinlian, the southern section of the Guangdong-Macau route has become tense, and Japanese air raids have intensified. According to a survey by the Provincial Air Defense Association, the number of air raids in November was 340 (including 90 reconnaissance planes and 76 transport planes), with 647 bombs dropped, 219 people injured, 153 people killed, 381 houses destroyed, and other losses including 25 ships, 13 vehicles, and 3 livestock. Among these losses, Qingyuan suffered the most severely, followed by Jieyang and Huiyang. The areas attacked included 21 counties and cities. The deaths and injuries were mostly innocent civilians, and the destroyed vehicles, ships, and goods belonged mostly to merchants transporting goods.</p>
<h3>The People of Southern Hunan Are Requesting to Form Volunteer Soldiers; Approvals Already Total Ten Regiments</h3>
<p>Changsha correspondence: Since receiving the Volunteer Soldier Recruitment Regulations issued by the Ministry of Military Administration, patriotic individuals throughout Hunan Province have been requesting to organize volunteer soldiers to depart for the front lines as soon as possible. The counties under the jurisdiction of the Dou Yong Division are the most enthusiastic.

Currently, those who have been assembled and organized include one regiment in Xiangping, four battalions led by Su Changfu, and two companies led by Jiang E. Eight regiments are currently being assembled and organized for departure.</p>
<p>The Shaoyang Sixth District Security Command has also formulated the following guidelines for recruiting and organizing volunteer soldiers to ensure that the public understands the procedures for enlisting as volunteer soldiers: (1) Volunteer soldiers must meet the physical examination standards, be healthy and strong men aged between 18 and 35 to qualify. The elderly, weak, sick, and those with severe addictions are not allowed to be recruited. (2) Unless specifically approved by the Ministry, bandits may not be recruited. (3) They must obey orders. (4) Volunteer soldier supervisors at all levels shall submit two copies of a letter of guarantee (a sample form is attached) when approving recruitment: (A) The regimental commander must obtain guarantees from two shops with capital of more than 10,000 yuan, or guarantees from two incumbent officers with the rank of major general or above; (B) The battalion commander must obtain guarantees from two shops with capital of more than 5,000 yuan, or guarantees from two incumbent officers with the rank of colonel or above; (C) The company commander must obtain guarantees from two shops with capital of more than 1,000 yuan, or guarantees from two incumbent officers with the rank of major or above.

<h3>Daylight Robberies in Wuxi City and Suburbs; Huge Sum Stolen from the Puppet Opium Bureau; Japanese and Puppet Military Police Unable to Protect</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Robberies have occurred frequently inside and outside the city of Wuxi. Robbers appear in broad daylight in busy markets without any scruples. The Hongji Shantang, an opium monopoly jointly operated by the Japanese and puppets, sent its staff members Zhou Zixiang and Wang Pinjin the day before yesterday to Shanghai with 10,740 yuan to purchase opium. When they arrived at Taiping Lane behind the Guangfu Gate, they were suddenly threatened with handguns by three strong men, who robbed the money-filled leather bag and fled towards Tonghui Bridge on Jiaoji Road. Although there were Japanese soldiers and puppet police posts nearby, they did not dare to give chase. At 8:00 PM on the 13th, the Xie Xing Yuan Tobacco Shop on Bei Wai Daqiao Street was already closed when six robbers suddenly claimed to be buying tobacco and robbed over 900 yuan in legal tender, including 30 silver dollars, before fleeing towards Ba Dou Lane. Although the nearby puppet police station was notified afterward, nothing was recovered. Currently, bandits are as numerous as hairs inside and outside Wuxi City, and merchants and residents are living in constant fear due to the lack of security.</p>

Mr. Fessenden refused to comment on the details and progress of the ongoing negotiations and discussions.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Unstable Again; Market Implements Strict Sanctions; Strict Punishment for Violating Price Limits; Daily Evaluation of Foreign Rice Should Be Conducted</h3>
<p>Speculators manipulating the rice market had once disappeared after being sanctioned by the authorities of both concessions and various rice trade associations, but are now stirring again in secret. Upon learning of the above situation, Mr. Ho Teh-kuei of the Shanghai Municipal Council notified Mr. Fu Qian-geng, Chairman of the Rice Market Management Committee, by telephone at 10:00 AM yesterday, instructing him to quickly adopt measures to stop it, stabilize the rice market, and maintain public order.</p>
<p>Management Committee Holds Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>After receiving Mr. Ho's notification, Mr. Fu Qian-geng, Chairman of the Rice Market Management Committee, immediately convened a 58th Management Committee meeting with all management committee members at the Qinglian Pavilion Public Sample Office on Fuzhou Road. After Chairman Fu Qian-geng reported the contents of Mr. Ho Teh-kuei's telephone call, he continued, stating that since the rice market was manipulated by speculators, after the concession authorities announced sanctions and various rice trade associations worked to stop it, and twice implemented price limits for sales, the rice market had tended to stabilize. However, recently, speculators seeking profit have become active again, causing the market, which had barely stabilized, to exhibit a precarious and insecure phenomenon. The price of domestic rice is being traded off the books, and the price of foreign rice has been rising continuously in recent days. If measures are not taken quickly to stop this, the future is a cause for great concern. Therefore, he requested that all committee members present express their opinions and discuss methods of sanction.</p>
<p>Attending Committee Member Delivers a Touching Speech</p>
<p>During the meeting, a certain management committee member delivered a touching speech, saying, "There are more than ten thousand rice industry colleagues in Shanghai who rely on this for a living, and there are even more who are indirectly involved. Now, because of the destruction by one or two treacherous people, our rice industry has suffered as a whole. The instability of the market has greatly affected our colleagues and subjected us to criticism from the outside world. After the two concession authorities announced price limits, the rice market has stabilized somewhat, but recently there has been a backlash. Although there are external factors involved, as long as our colleagues maintain a stable attitude, the rice market will not fall into such chaos. If the price of domestic rice is raised again, then the price of rice flour in the interior will also rise due to the influence of the Shanghai rice price, making the source of domestic rice even more difficult. As for the purchase of foreign rice, it can be managed at the prices of the previous days, but if it is manipulated and raised again by speculators, it will cause social unrest again. For the sake of the food supply of the entire city and the livelihood of our own children, relatives, and friends, we should also rise up and sanction these harmful individuals."</p>
<p>Publish Announcements and Comply With Resolutions</p>
<p>After listening, all the committee members present were filled with emotion and unanimously hated the speculators who harmed the lives of the citizens and disrupted the business of their colleagues. The following resolutions were then passed: (1) Publish a sincere announcement urging brokers not to engage in illegal business activities. It was resolved to advise brokers to strictly abide by the price limits for domestic rice and not engage in illegal business activities. If anyone dares to violate this, they should be socially sanctioned, and the Rice Trade Association and the two concession authorities should be requested to impose severe penalties. (2) Provide a tip box for people to report secretly. It was resolved that the Market Management Committee should provide a tip box for people to report secretly, without having to provide their names, so that the reports can be sent to the General Association and the two concession authorities for strict action. (3) The price of foreign rice should be determined at any time by the Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Association and notified to the market for business operations at that price. It was resolved to send a letter to the Civil Food Regulation Association requesting it to evaluate and notify the market daily, so that business operations can be carried out based on this evaluation. (4) Provide bonuses to reward those who report illegal business activities. It was resolved that this bonus should be borne by all colleagues in the market, except for the person being reported. (5) Holiday closures for National Days and New Year's Day. It was resolved to close for one day on Christmas and two days on National New Year's Day (the 1st and 2nd of January). The above resolutions were drafted last night and decided to be announced this morning.</p>
<p>Regulation Association Sets Rice Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Association convened a meeting of industry representatives the day before yesterday (22nd). In addition to actively raising funds to order foreign rice, it was resolved to handle the ordering of foreign rice on behalf of others starting today. The method for handling the ordering of foreign rice on behalf of others is recorded as follows: Any organizations, institutions, companies, factories, or shops wishing to order foreign rice should obtain an application form from the association, fill it out according to the instructions, sign and seal it by a responsible person, and submit it to the collection agency designated by the association, along with a deposit of 20 yuan in national currency per bag, and obtain a receipt issued by the association. The amount ordered should be at least 50 bags per household per time. The ordering person may not cancel or reduce the amount they have ordered. After the association has accumulated a considerable quantity, it will check the market price and freight of foreign rice, and after deliberation by the Procurement Committee of the association, it will telegraph an order for foreign rice from abroad, and immediately settle the foreign exchange. The next day, the ordering person will be notified, and when the foreign rice arrives in Shanghai, they will be notified to pay the full amount. When necessary, they may consult with the bank to do documentary bills. The address of the association is Room 304, 3rd Floor, 59 Hong Kong Road.</p>
<h3>Royal Air Force Association Fetes Outgoing Shanghai Consul</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the Shanghai Royal Air Force Association held a banquet yesterday (22nd) at the association's headquarters in the HSBC Building to bid farewell to Sir Philip, the outgoing British Consul-General in Shanghai. Among those present were Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, Anne George (Sir Philip's successor), and representatives from various British associations in the city.

Sir Philip also gave a speech in reply to thank them.</p>
<h3>Changes to Xinkai River Traffic Regulations; Japanese Issue New "Citizen's Certificates" That Require a Guarantor; Reports That the Nanshi Refugee Area Has Been Entrusted to Handle It Are False</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Xinkai River in the French Concession, those entering and exiting Nanshi have been crowded. On the seventh day after the opening, the Japanese suddenly strictly inspected the "Citizen's Certificates" issued by Nanshi, and those issued after October were prohibited from being used and could not enter Nanshi. Therefore, those who had newly obtained certificates were blocked. After several days of excitement, the Xinkai River is now desolate again. There are rumors that the handling of entry and exit permits will be entrusted by the French and Japanese to the Nanshi Refugee Area Office, but this statement has been found to be inaccurate after investigation. It is heard that the Japanese have decided to issue new "Citizen's Certificates", but the requirements for obtaining these new "Certificates" will be strict, and it is heard that those obtaining "Certificates" will have to have a considerable guarantee.</p>
<p>The Puppet Government Collects Rent for Properties in the City</p>
<p>The Youth Corps of the puppet "District Public Office" in Nanshi, recently instructed by the Japanese Nanshi Squad, will, for all existing houses in Nanshi, regardless of whether they are occupied or not, collect rent from the puppet district office, wherever the owner has not come forward to collect the rent. 60% of the income will be used as handling fees, etc., and 40% will be temporarily stored in the puppet district office, and the house owner will prepare a business certificate and report it for collection. Most of the owners in Nanshi are well aware of righteousness and have not yet collected rent. Seeing an opportunity, the Japanese puppets forced them to submit.</p>
<p>Nanshi Residents Plan to Refuse Payment</p>
<p>However, it is difficult for the residents of Nanshi to maintain their livelihoods, so they cannot afford to pay rent. Therefore, they decided to take a desperate measure to refuse payment. This severe measure was implemented a few days ago, when members of the puppet youth corps sent by the puppet district office investigated houses in various places in Nanshi, such as Danfeng Road and Guanyinge Street in the refugee area, and posted paper strips printed with the name of the Japanese Shanghai Special Service Agency's Nanshi Squad at the doorways.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Jewish Emigrants Convene a General Meeting to Develop in the Northeast</h3>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Far Eastern Jewish Emigrant Society began yesterday evening in Harbin.

The Shanghai Jewish Emigrant Society has sent representatives to attend. These plenary sessions have been held annually for the past two years. The 1937 congress organized the Far Eastern Jewish Emigrant Society Affairs Bureau, which is responsible for coordinating Jewish emigrant affairs in various places and convening plenary sessions. The Affairs Bureau is now seeking to obtain transit permits for Jewish refugees who continue to arrive in Shanghai from Germany via Siberia and is negotiating with the "Manchukuo" to obtain immigration permits for the purpose of relocating Jewish refugees to Harbin and other locations in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Investigation Continues Into Car Shooting, but No Witnesses Can Give Consistent Reports</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that at 6:20 PM on Thursday, a black car on Jing'an Temple Road near Seymour Road was shot at by two of four people who rushed out from the roadside. Although the car was hit by several bullets, it quickly drove away. It is believed that this was an attempted assassination. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station were still collecting fragmented information yesterday (22nd), but so far no witnesses have been able to give consistent reports. At 9:15 PM on Thursday night, six cars with Seventh Fleet military license plates, carrying Japanese people, were traveling west on Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch. The previous rumor that these cars were related to the shooting on Jing'an Temple Road is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>National Revival Day Tomorrow; Telegrams to Comfort Front-Line Soldiers; Frequent Good News Since the Winter Counter-Offensive; Shanghai Supports National Policy With Unwavering Determination</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and National Revival Day. All sectors of the city have decided to celebrate enthusiastically and practice frugality to help refugees. Various industrial and commercial groups sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to express their condolences, stating: To Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission and all the front-line soldiers fighting against the enemy: The strong Japanese have invaded China for two years now. Fortunately, under your leadership, our troops have resisted strongly. The morale of the troops has become stronger as they fight, and the spirit of the people has become stronger as they fight. Although the enemy is stubborn, they have suffered heavy losses and are bogged down and unable to extricate themselves. Since the various routes began their winter counter-offensive, good news has been frequently reported and progress has been made. We are extremely excited to hear this. Although the people of Shanghai are in an isolated island, they support the national policy with unwavering determination. On this National Revival Day, we respectfully express our sincerity and send this telegram to express our condolences. (The rest omitted)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Vehicle Injures Elderly Man; Drives Away Without Regard; Utter Lack of Humanity Is Shocking; Fortunately, an American Citizen Calls for Police and Sends Him to Hospital</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that at 4:25 PM yesterday (22nd), a Japanese military truck, traveling north on the Bund, overturned a rickshaw. An elderly Chinese man, richly dressed, was thrown from the rickshaw and landed headfirst on the pavement in front of the Bank of Communications building near Fuzhou Road. The Japanese military truck had license plate number 105 and a star insignia of the army, with the Japanese characters "Rikugun" (army). After hitting the rickshaw, the truck stopped. One of the three Japanese soldiers in the truck immediately took out a crank and started the engine. When the Japanese soldier returned to the side of the driver and sat down, the truck immediately started and drove towards Hongkou. None of the three Japanese soldiers helped the fallen elderly man, and they did not even check the results of the accident. An American citizen was the first to reach the injured elderly man, helped him up, leaned him against a tree, and called a Chinese policeman directing traffic at the intersection of the Bund and Fuzhou Road. The elderly man said that he was 66 years old, his forehead was bleeding, and he had suffered a violent concussion. The Chinese policeman went to call a fire brigade ambulance. The American citizen stayed with the elderly man until another Chinese policeman arrived at the scene. The injured man was sent to Renji Hospital. The rickshaw that was hit was severely damaged, but fortunately, the rickshaw puller was not injured. Two foreigners witnessed the incident, but only one gave his name to the police.</p>
<h3>Christmas Consumption: Advocating for Donations, Huang Yuzhai Pledges 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since becoming a member of the Shanghai Refugee Association's fundraising committee and the Finance Committee of the Refugee Children's Education and Care Center, Mr. Huang Yuzhai, General Manager of Hui Zhong Bank, has spared no effort to solicit donations from all sectors, even amidst his busy schedule. In view of the approaching Christmas season, he believes that extravagant spending should be avoided during these times of national crisis and that frugality is especially important. He has sent a letter to both the Refugee Children's and Women's Education and Care Centers, donating 400 gold yuan, and has also written a declaration to wealthy gentlemen throughout the city to advocate for donations, benefit disaster victims, and create welfare for the nation. This is truly commendable. The original text of his letter is recorded below (excerpted above): "As Christmas approaches again, the city is adorned with lights and decorations, creating a sleepless night. The extravagance and revelry seem unrestrained, while the dance halls and bars are filled with lingering guests. The music is loud and cheerful, but who knows the cries of the refugees? They revel in carefree dancing and singing, completely forgetting the tragedy of life. If it were a time of peace and prosperity, there would be nothing wrong with joining in the festivities and enjoying the world-embracing holiday. However, Christmas was originally a festival to save the world and rescue people. Now, it has become a time for wild celebration and entertainment, ignoring the truth. How can this be justified when juxtaposed with the miserable lives of refugee children? These refugee children who are starving and freezing today will be the masters who shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the future. If we can educate and nurture them and put them on the right track, they may achieve even greater things because of their difficult backgrounds. However, today they are suffering from cold and hunger, let alone education and care. Living so close to each other, they are in heaven and hell, as different as if they were in different worlds. How can we say that this is fair? Now that the festive season is here again, I encourage thrift and donate 100 national currency yuan for Christmas consumption, and I have also raised 300 yuan from Guo Hui, totaling 400 national currency yuan, all of which will be donated to the Refugee Children's and Women's Education and Care Centers. I believe that one night of extravagance in a dance hall costs at least 50 yuan. If each family spends that much, the total consumption of dozens of families in Shanghai will exceed one million yuan. If we can eliminate extravagant entertainment and abstain from wasteful spending, then we can seize the moment for survival and rejuvenation. As for the expensive dinners that cost five yuan per guest, they are equivalent to the amount of money needed to help a refugee who has been displaced. If wealthy gentlemen throughout the city can save the money from one meal and donate it to refugee children, it will not affect the diners' appetites, but it will be as kind as giving a second life to the recipients, benefiting the country and the people. All depend on it." (excerpted below)</p>
<h3>Finnish Embassy Accepts Foreign Donations</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Finnish citizens are currently fighting heroically against a superior enemy. Some foreigners in Shanghai have been willing to donate to help the Finns for some time. Therefore, the "Friends of Finland Fund" has been established. The Finnish legation office, located in the Mai'erxi Ailu Yasi'teliete apartment (transliteration), has been authorized to accept all donations and is calling on foreign nationals in Shanghai during Christmas to provide assistance.</p>

<h3>Sassoon Donates a Large Sum to France</h3>
<p>Sir Victor Sassoon, a British citizen, donated one million yuan to the Shanghai British War Relief Central Fund on October 19th. A reporter from Dazhong News Agency learned yesterday that Sir Victor Sassoon has recently donated another 25,000 francs to the Shanghai French War Relief Fund.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Reclaim Sanzao Again; Zhang Miaogen's Puppet Troops Retreat Knowing the Difficulty</h3>
<p>Sanzao Town, located northwest of Nanhui County in Pudong, is a strategically important location. It is located fifteen li from the new market town to the southwest and fifteen li from the Zhubiao town at the end of Shangchuan Road. The town is quite prosperous. The puppet troops of Zhang Miaogen's department had deployed dozens of troops in the town to collect taxes from the villagers. The coastal Hua You Army assault team led by Gu Shouxin, Li Wenyuan, and others launched a punitive expedition within the past week. Zhang Miaogen's troops were outnumbered. After two nights of fighting, fifty to sixty soldiers were killed or wounded. They sought help from the Japanese army in the new market town. When the Japanese soldiers arrived outside Sanzao Town, they were ambushed by the Chinese army in the dark, resulting in eight deaths and even more injuries. The Japanese army was outnumbered and retreated to the new market town. They urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Japanese Army Command for help. By this time, Sanzao Town had been retaken by the guerrillas. After surveying the people, it was found that over fifty people were hit by stray bullets and were being comforted. Three days ago, the Japanese side in Shanghai suddenly transferred 600 sick soldiers undergoing recuperation, dividing them into two routes to Shangnan and Shangchuan Road, hoping to achieve the effect of a pincer attack. One route arrived at Zhoupu, and the other arrived at Chuansha. They then got off the vehicles and launched an attack towards Sanzao. The Chinese army received the news earlier. Due to the disparity in numbers, they quickly retreated towards the coast. The Japanese army attacked an empty town, garrisoned it for two nights, and seeing no movement, returned to Shanghai in full force the day before yesterday. Zhang Miaogen's troops were about to take over the defense of Sanzao Town from the Japanese army when the Japanese army left, and the guerrillas quickly reclaimed Sanzao again, and are preparing to advance towards Tanzhi Bridge to the west and Liuzhao to the north. Therefore, Zhang Miaogen's troops retreated knowing the difficulty.</p>
<h3>Ministry Orders Thorough Investigation of Textile Raw Materials in Shanghai Factories; Determining Whether There Are Any Cases of Alteration or Adulteration; A Detailed Investigation and Report to Clarify the Truth</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has received reports that Shanghai Hongzhang Yarn Factory, Hefeng Enterprise Company, China Underwear Company, Yingzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Huayang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and other fourteen factories are using 42-count double-strand mercerized colored thread and 20-count single yarn to weave factory cloth. Because Japanese goods are cheaper, all of these factories are using them. Among them, the various cloths produced by Hongzhang Yarn Factory are particularly noticeable for using Japanese yarn. Yinfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, in addition to using untaxed Japanese yarn for its own weaving, also sells ready-made Japanese goods that have been altered and repackaged. Other factories also occasionally purchase Japanese goods for processing and dyeing when their own woven grey cloth is insufficient. The Ministry of Economic Affairs needs to thoroughly investigate and clarify the actual production capacity and quantity of each factory, the composition of the yarn and raw materials used, and whether the allegations of processing, alteration, and adulteration are true. Therefore, it has sent telegrams to relevant parties to conduct a detailed investigation and report to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships to Wenzhou Turn Back One After Another; Japanese Still Jealous of Foreign Shipping to Shanghai and Wenzhou</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the Japanese are still jealous of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou. The Japanese Naval Headquarters once ordered the Third Fleet stationed in eastern Zhejiang to prevent any foreign ships from entering the Ou River. However, the foreign ships' trial voyages to Wenzhou were all successful, which led the Naval Authorities to severely criticize the fleet. Recently, the Japanese Naval Department, under the pretext of sealing off the Wenzhou route under orders, dispatched a large 2,500-ton warship in mid-month and anchored it at the mouth of the Yanpan River outside Wenzhou. It has been stationed there for a long time without moving, and its purpose is entirely to monitor foreign ships entering the Ou River. The British ships Xin'an Nana and Xin'an Mao, which recently sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou, were blocked by the warship and anchored at Huanghuaguan for many days. Now, the two ships, unable to enter the port, returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 22nd and arrived at the port at 2 p.m. yesterday. It was also reported that the Norwegian merchant ship Huasheng, which made a second voyage to Wenzhou, had arrived in Wenzhou, but in reality, it was blocked outside the port and took refuge elsewhere. It stopped there for seven days, but never managed to enter the port and returned to Shanghai with its original cargo the night before. Therefore, all the ships that sailed to Wenzhou this time have been blocked and turned back one after another. However, it is learned that the Manili Maler intends to load cargo and sail to Wenzhou for another trial voyage. The Xin'an Nana has decided to stop sailing on that route and switch to another route. It is said that the average loss for each ship sailing to Wenzhou this time is several tens of thousands of yuan.</p>

<h3>Japanese Marines Infringe Upon Police Authority in the Northern District; Truck Drivers Often Detained Without Cause; Nearly One Hundred Arrested in Recent Days</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post," the Japanese Marines are continuing to take steps to control the police authority in the Northern District of the Public Concession. It is reported that several truck drivers have been arrested in recent days. The Japanese have taken this action without notifying the Public Concession Police Department in advance. Therefore, the Police Department is unaware of the arrests. A foreign truck owner cited an example, saying that his two trucks and drivers were arrested by the Japanese Marines at the intersection of Broadway and Zhaofeng Road yesterday morning (22nd) and taken to the Japanese Marines Headquarters on Jiangwan Road. The foreign truck owner learned of this and went to the Japanese Headquarters. Due to language barriers, the drivers handed over their driving licenses and were interrogated. They were released only after nearly three hours. A senior official of the Police Department was asked about the actions of the Japanese Marines this morning and stated that they had not received any reports of the arrests. Other truck owners operating in the Northern District of the Public Concession claimed that in recent days, the Japanese Marines have taken similar actions in the Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Huishan districts. Nearly one hundred drivers have been arrested, all of whom are Chinese. Most have been released.</p>
<h3>Road Construction Workers of the Municipal Council Demand Rice Subsidies</h3>
<p>All the road construction workers of the Public Concession jointly submitted a petition yesterday to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, the First Special District Citizens' Federation, and the Refugee Relief Association, stating: "Due to the high price of rice, expenses are insufficient. We request that you uphold justice and forward this to the Municipal Council to approve rice subsidies to show relief. We believe that rice is the people's staple food, which is universally known. High prices are detrimental to people's livelihoods, which is a concern of administrative authorities. However, unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate prices, and the price of rice has risen again and again. In order to stabilize society, the authorities have promulgated price limits, but the price limits have changed repeatedly, increasing the burden on the poor. Everyone feels uneasy, and desperation has led to rice riots. Although coercive suppression seems to have eased the situation on the surface, the people are actually living in misery. If this continues, it will not only be about rice riots. Road workers are all survivors of war and rely on labor to maintain their livelihoods. They only get 75 cents of wages per day for the work of cattle and horses, and Sundays are excluded. On average, their income can only be exchanged for a few pints of rice, which is barely enough to feed themselves, and they are still worried that it is not enough. Clothing and housing cannot be resolved. Moreover, everyone in the world has parents, wives, and children. How can they support their parents and raise their children? Everyone sympathizes with this situation. We originally intended to propose a wage increase, but due to overstaffing, we took a step back and asked for a rice subsidy of one dime per worker temporarily to help. If the price of rice returns to normal, we are willing to cancel it immediately. This kind of goodwill request has not been accepted, which is very unfortunate. Therefore, we especially request your association to sympathize with the poor and uphold justice. Refugees are still being rescued, how can we create new refugees? We beg you to forward this to the Municipal Council for a fair claim. One word is worth more than nine cauldrons. We are extremely eager for your assistance, which would be a great kindness."</p>
<h3>Resuming Dredging of the Huangpu River; Soundings Begin; Dredging Vessels Tested in the Huangpu River; Companies Will Dredge on Their Own</h3>
<p>Some of the dredging vessels of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau have been returned by the Japanese. The Dredging Department of the Bureau, together with the Port Affairs Section of the Jianghai Customs, is testing the vessels in the Huangpu River. Most of them are badly rusted and need to be repaired in dry dock. It is learned that the Bureau originally had a shipyard in Zhanghuabang, but it is still occupied by the Japanese. The above-mentioned ship repair project will be entrusted to other shipyards.</p>
<p>Dredging Steps: The Bureau has decided to start with surveying to resume dredging work. Therefore, it will send surveying vessels to take soundings in various sections of the Huangpu River and dredge the areas where the silt is most severe and obstructs navigation. The dredging of the Shintang outside the Wusongkou and the Wusong River (i.e., Suzhou Creek) will be resumed after the dredging of various sections of the Huangpu River has begun.</p>
<p>Impact on Shipping: Currently, due to the low water season and low tide in the Huangpu River, ships with deeper drafts are having difficulty berthing close to the riverbank in areas such as the 16th Pier during low tide. Therefore, all shipping companies will rent dredging vessels to dredge on their own. The cost of this dredging will be borne by the shipping companies themselves, which is a result of the suspension of dredging work and can be said to be an unexpected loss.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Student Kidnapped on Sima Road Yesterday Afternoon; Name: Wang Haicheng, Only Nine Years Old; Abducted by Four Bandits When Leaving School</h3>
<p>At around 12:00 noon yesterday, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred at the eastern end of Fuzhou Road and Shilu Road in the Public Concession. The kidnapped person was an elementary school student. After the case occurred, the police immediately ordered detectives to investigate. The investigation is still ongoing. It is learned that the kidnapped elementary school student is a student at the attached elementary school of the Shanghai Middle School branch on Fuzhou Road. His name is Wang Haicheng, a native of Ningbo, and he is nine years old. When the student left the school, he was abducted by four men at the school gate, which seems to be an abduction, but this cannot be confirmed at present.</p>
<h3>Mao Liying Case: No Progress; Japanese Military Police Promised to Investigate; No News to Date</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Ms. Mao Liying was ambushed and seriously injured on Nanjing Road at nearly 7 p.m. on the 12th of this month. She died on the 15th. After the incident, someone saw two Chinese running north from the corner of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road to Ningbo Road, jumping into a black car and speeding west. At around 7:15, the car was driving along Avenue Edward VII, with all its lights off. Near Hart Road, there was a shootout with the patrol search team. At nearly 7:30, someone saw a black car with one tire deflated driving into Avenue Joffre. Although the Japanese military police promised the Public Concession Police Department that they would investigate the matter, there is now a significant phenomenon that proves that this case will likely be classified as an unsolved assassination case. To date, the Japanese military police's guarantee to investigate the "headquarters" remains empty words. It is not yet known whether the Japanese authorities have begun to investigate the matter. However, it is learned that the Public Concession Police Department requested the Japanese military police to conduct an investigation on the 13th of this month and has not received any news about the investigation to date.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Merchant Ship Tangbei Crew Forcibly Expelled by Japanese</h3>
<p>According to reports, the Tangbei ship was seized by the Japanese and sailed to Dinghai from the Garden Wharf at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. When inquiries were made to the Huamei Shipping Company, the person in charge of the company replied that the Tangbei crew was indeed forcibly expelled by the Japanese, and the company is trying to negotiate. As for the claim that the ship had sailed to Dinghai the day before yesterday, the company still learned today (i.e., the 23rd) that the ship was still moored at the Yangshupu pontoon. However, it is heard that the Japanese are determined to go their own way, disregarding the rights and interests of third countries, and are eager to resume sailing. However, the American side, in order to protect its claims, has decided to initiate serious negotiations.</p>
<h3>Shipping Sales Dispute; Defendant Made Huge Profits and Unwilling to Sell; Plaintiff Sues for Breach of Contract and Claims Damages; Court Debates Conclude and Date Set for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Ye Chuanfang, the manager of the Huashang Shipping Company at No. 2 Bund, French Concession, and Madden (transliteration), the manager of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., had a dispute over the sale of the Naode ship, which led Madden to hire lawyers Xu Shihao, Rong Zhenlong to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Special Second Court against Ye Chuanfang, demanding the delivery of the ship, with the plaintiff paying the defendant a ship price of 20,000 British pounds, and ordering the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for a loss of 1,360 British pounds per month from October 31 of this year until the date of actual delivery of the ship. If the defendant cannot deliver the ship, in addition to compensating for the above-mentioned loss, he will also compensate the plaintiff for 10,000 pounds. After receiving the complaint, the court had a hearing presided over by Judge Yu Changzi. In addition to the plaintiff's lawyers stating the reasons for the lawsuit, the defendant, accompanied by lawyer Jiang Yiping, appeared in court to defend, stating that the letters between the parties presented by the plaintiff did not establish a sales contract at all and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court, with each party sticking to its own argument, believed that an investigation was necessary and ordered a new hearing to be scheduled. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now heard that the plaintiff's lawyers have submitted additional facts and reasons during the rescheduled hearing to prove the establishment of the sales contract between the two parties. On the previous day, the court was convened for a continuation of the hearing. The judge advised the defendant to ask the plaintiff to increase the ship price and sell the Naode ship to the plaintiff. According to the defendant Ye Chuanfang, he originally planned to engage in the timber business and needed funds, so he was willing to sell the ship. Now that the timber business has been cancelled and no longer needs funds, he is unwilling to sell even if the plaintiff increases the price and admits that the Naode ship can earn a net profit of 600 pounds per month. If priced at market value, the ship would now be worth at least 25,000 to 30,000 pounds. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that it can be seen that the ship is indeed owned by the defendant Ye Chuanfang, and his contradictory defenses and failure to perform the contract are obvious. The reason is that since the outbreak of the European War and the sinking of many ships, the price of ships has continued to soar, and it is not because the contract was not fundamentally established, but to obtain a higher price. The court, after examining the situation, ordered the lawyers of both parties to begin the debate after the defendant refused to reconcile. After the debate concluded, a date was set for sentencing on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>

<h3>Stealing a Huge Sum of Money from a Classmate; After Being Arrested, He Revealed the Stolen Money and Was Sentenced to Detention with a Suspended Sentence</h3>
<p>Chen Limin, a youth from Fujian (17 years old), and Wu Zhilai, a youth from Guangdong (also 17 years old), both resided in Nanyang. They were also classmates in the same school, so their friendship was extremely strong, even better than siblings. In the autumn of this year, Chen and Wu traveled to Shanghai together to study. At that time, they took the entrance examination and enrolled in a certain middle school at No. 300 Beijing Road, and they were both boarders, living in the same room. When Chen came to Shanghai from Nanyang, he brought 600 Nanyang banknotes, which he exchanged for legal tender in Shanghai, obtaining more than 4,000 yuan. Because he was unfamiliar with the place, he did not deposit the money in the bank, but placed it in a box. On the 21st of this month, Chen opened the box and suddenly saw that the box lock had been destroyed, and the 3,600 yuan of legal tender stored in the box had disappeared. He urgently reported to the school authorities. Upon investigation, Wu was deemed to be highly suspicious, but Wu ultimately denied it. In order to clarify the truth, they had no choice but to report to the General Police Station and order detectives to take Wu to the police station for questioning. Wu then confessed without denying it and revealed that the stolen money was hidden at the home of a friend named Hu at No. 334 Baker Road. The detectives rushed to recover 400 yuan in cash, a deposit book for 2,500 yuan from the Bank of China, and a deposit book for 200 yuan from the Shanghai Bank in Wu's own name. They were all escorted to the Criminal Court No. 4 of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the process and filed a lawsuit on the charge of theft. Chen Limin then stated that he had been classmates with the defendant in Nanyang since the third grade of elementary school. Since most of the money has been recovered, he did not want to pursue the matter further. When Wu Zhilai was questioned, he also confessed to the theft. Judge Zhan Liangce, after verifying the confession, sentenced Wu Zhi Mi to 50 days of detention with a three-year suspended sentence in court and ordered the stolen goods to be returned to the plaintiff for collection. After the sentencing, he gave the defendant a reprimand, saying, "You are young and are in a time of study. You have committed this theft, which is very detrimental to your future. I hope you will wake up and work hard to study and progress, so that you will not lose the potential to be a person of talent."</p>
<h3>Accountant Embezzles a Huge Sum of Money; Sentenced to Three Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhifei, a native of Songjiang, 22 years old, residing at No. 1 Avenue Foch, was an employee of the accounting department of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, Zhang Zhifei associated with bad people, which led him to indulge in gambling dens such as Hollywood and the Asia Club in western Shanghai all day long. From August 9 to November 5 of this year, he lost as much as 43,000 yuan in these four months, and this amount of money was all public funds embezzled from the International Hotel. The matter was discovered by the accounting director Fang Yindi, who reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, and detective Chen Baozhong arrested Zhang and escorted him to the First Special Court. After the interrogation was concluded, Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the Criminal Court No. 2 yesterday morning and announced the verdict, sentencing Zhang Zhifei to three years in prison for continuous embezzlement of property held in the course of business. The defendant should compensate the plaintiff 42,833 national currency yuan, with an annual interest rate of 5% from December 19 of this year until the end of the execution.</p>

<h3>Hongrui Lane: Landlord Raises Rent Again; Tenants Resolutely Resist</h3>
<p>In Hongrui Lane, Xinzha Road, a rent increase and water shut-off dispute occurred last year. The matter was resolved after water meters were installed for each tenant at their own expense. Unexpectedly, tenants in the lane were recently verbally notified by the rent collector of another rent increase, causing widespread panic. Therefore, all tenants in the lane held an emergency meeting the night before and decided on the following: (1) If the landlord disregards the difficult times and insists on implementing a second rent increase, all will refuse to accept the rent increase notice; (2) All tenants should abide by the regulations of the Tenants' Association, take unified action, and not negotiate privately; (3) Pay rent according to the original amount.

<h3>Patricide Case Appealed: Forensic Examination Begins</h3>
<p>The principal offenders in the patricide case, the Zhou brothers, Qinji and Qinxiang, from Ningbo, and their mother, Zhou Jing, appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court because they disagreed with the first-instance judgment. During the court hearing a few days ago, the presiding judge suddenly took sick leave, and the hearing was postponed. It is now learned that regarding the defendant's sole ground for appeal, which is that they suffer from hereditary neurasthenia, Wei Ligong, the forensic doctor of the First Special Court, has been approved by Zhou Han, the presiding judge of the High Court's Criminal Division, to conduct an examination. Therefore, he began the examination work yesterday together with forensic doctor Zhang Yan. It is said that it will take about one or two weeks to complete. The defendant had requested the appointment of Yuan Junchang, a forensic psychiatrist and expert from the former Ministry of Justice's Forensic Examination Institute, to participate in the examination, but because there is no such procedure in law, the High Court has not yet approved it.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read today's edition of your esteemed newspaper, which published the case of the appeal between Ma Caizhen, a woman from Pinghu, and another party, the article stated, "Dr. Yang Zhenfu of the Civilian Hospital performed an abortion," which not only does not correspond with the facts but also greatly deviates from the court records. Upon investigation, our hospital was merely in the position of a witness in this case, only proving whether Ma Caizhen had an abortion when she came to the hospital for medical treatment. The judgment case did not involve our hospital at all. However, this news report distorts the truth and adds the words "performed an abortion," which is related to the reputation of our hospital. We request that you kindly make a correction. Respectfully, the Civilian Sanatorium.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Gentlemen of the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Having read yesterday's edition of your esteemed newspaper, which reported the kidnapping of Chen Dayu's son, mentioning that I was guarding the child at the Dajing Troupe, this is not true. Fearing that the outside world may misunderstand the truth, I respectfully request a correction. This is a solemn declaration. Qiao Guochang, December 23rd.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Overview of This Year's Unified University Entrance Examination (12)</h3>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Zhou's total score was 320. His first choice was the Economics Department of National Central University, his second choice was the Political Science Department of National Southwestern Associated University, and his third choice was the Education Department of National Central University.</p>
<p>Wang's total score was 300. His first choice was the Economics Department of National Central University, his second choice was the Education Department of National Central University, and his third choice was the History and Geography Department of Zhejiang University.</p>
<p>Zhou's total score was higher than Wang's, but his second choice was full and he could not be assigned there. Wang's score was not as good as Zhou's, and his first choice was also full, so he was left out. However, his second choice, the Education Department of National Central University, accepted him because there were not many applicants. When Zhou was assigned to his third choice, the quota for that department had already been filled, and he could not be assigned there. Therefore, the result was that although Zhou's score was high, he could not be assigned to the Education Department of National Central University, while Wang's score was lower, but he was assigned to the Education Department of National Central University. From these two examples, it can be seen that to achieve the goal of attending one's desired school or department, first, the score must be high, and second, there should not be too many applicants with the same choice. If the score is not high and there are too many applicants with the same choice, it will be very difficult to achieve one's goal. Admission is based on a standard, and assignment is based on a comparison of many people to determine the standard. In other words, it is a comparative standard, not an absolute standard. However, this comparative standard is determined by a very mechanical and rigid procedure and is by no means arbitrary. At the same time, I advise you gentlemen who are taking the examination to rely on your own efforts to achieve your desired admission.</p>
<p>(10) General Criticisms</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the unified examination for two years, the general public's criticisms of this system have generally fallen into the following three categories:</p>
<p>(1) Different Concepts of Strictness and Leniency We often hear different views from the general public regarding criticisms of the unified examination. Universities often believe that the admission standards are too low and cannot improve the level of education, while the public fears that the admission standards are too high, causing many young people to miss out on education. Although these two views are contradictory, their positions and starting points are different. Let's first talk about the criticisms from the lenient perspective. First, they believe that the admission standards are too low. Last year, the highest standard for the two tests was a total score of 280, and the lowest was 210. Calculated with seven subjects, the average score was only 40 and 30 points. This year's admission standard is a total score of 230, with an average score of 33 points. In fact, the so-called low score is generally low. The reason for the low score, I have already said before. If each school conducts its own entrance examination, and the scores of the general candidates are too low, at least those with higher scores must be selected from the low scores. In any case, it is not possible not to admit anyone, right? There is also a remedy. If the scores of individual admissions are too poor, they can be supplemented by additional recruitment. However, the unified examination cannot be done for various reasons. Moreover, the average score of students admitted by schools themselves is also lower than 40 to 30 points. It can be seen that the admission standards for the unified examination are not considered low. Furthermore, in terms of the proportion of admissions, it was two to one last year, and this year it has risen to four to one. Although some schools have a proportion as high as ten to one, there are many cases of students taking exams at multiple schools and being admitted repeatedly. This proportion is certainly not standard. Students taking the unified examination can only take the exam once, and the proportion of admissions is actually quite high. Moreover, this year's proportion is smaller than last year's. In other words, this year is twice as strict as last year. There is also one more thing. Because of the poor performance in basic subjects of the freshmen admitted last year, the Ministry of Education issued a supplementary study program. This is also evidence that the general public believes that the unified examination scores are too low and the admission is not strict enough. In fact, in extraordinary times, middle school students have poor grades due to the various reasons mentioned above, and universities should find ways to remedy them. If we must raise the admission standard to an average score of 60 points, then according to this year's score distribution, only 121 people nationwide will be admitted. May I ask, if the country spends tens of millions every year to run universities, will it only admit so few students? If we divide it equally among twenty or so universities, each school will only admit five people. Is that enough to run a university? We need a large number of professionals in various fields during and after the war. Universities are the places where professionals are created. If only such a small number is created, how can we shoulder the major mission of resistance and reconstruction?</p>
<h3>Schools to Commemorate Yunnan Uprising Tomorrow; Ministry Orders Day Off</h3>

<h3>Ginling Women's College Establishes Experimental Department at Nanjing Campus to Aid Out-of-School Girls</h3>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, Ginling Women's College in Nanjing has moved west with the military and has now re-established its campus in Huaxi Dam, Chengdu, Sichuan. When the original Nanjing campus was evacuated, a portion of the faculty and staff stayed behind. When Nanjing fell, the school immediately established a women and children's shelter to rescue women and children affected by the disaster. In May of last year, the women and children's shelter was declared disbanded. Subsequently, the school's faculty and staff operated a women's supplementary class to impart general knowledge to women. Recently, the school, in view of the large number of out-of-school female students in Nanjing, has opened an experimental department to help them. It is reported that the school is very crowded, with most of the students being those who do not want to receive anesthetizing indoctrination.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Still Has Little Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. In the gray market for British and American exchange rates, there was only half a day of trading on Saturday, and because the following Monday and Tuesday are Christmas, which is traditionally a holiday, there was a three-day vacation including Sunday. Therefore, although there was a subtle downward trend, people were not completely swayed by the good interest rate news, and few actively absorbed it. The reason for their bearish outlook is that the report on the day stated that the central government was cracking down on remittances of British pounds to China via Hong Kong, which would invisibly reduce the amount of funds flowing out of Hong Kong. Therefore, it initially attracted Chinese banks to buy in, but later it relied on the willingness of foreign banks to supply, since Hong Kong Telecommunications had previously sold off, so the trend was still able to stabilize. The half-day process: the opening prices were flat, and after a while, Chinese banks and others bought in slightly, suddenly forming a slight tightness. Then, Hong Kong Telecommunications injected funds, and foreign banks were also willing to sell, causing the market to become slightly firmer. The British pound once strengthened to 4 shillings 703125, and the US dollar also exceeded 7.71875 yuan. Afterwards, it turned stable again. Around 11:00, Japanese banks suddenly bought in, and the situation became slightly tighter again. The British pound reached 4 shillings 6875, and the US dollar reached 7.6875 yuan again. However, by noon, there were fewer buyers, and the situation returned to flat. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were: British pound 4 shillings 703125, US dollar 7.71875 yuan, next month's futures British pound 4 shillings 671875, US dollar 7.59375 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous day, both the current and futures British and American currencies remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Good News Has No Impact</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's big bar was short 0.0625 in the near term, while the far term was unchanged. New York silver prices were closed, and London's raw gold was unchanged. The exchange rates of British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai, France, and other currencies were all flat. US dollars depreciated 0.1875 against British pounds, 0.05 yuan against Shanghai, and 0.025 against France. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were: British gold 4 shillings 703125, US exchange 7.71875 yuan, with no changes compared to the previous close. After opening, because of reports that the British government was cracking down on remittances to China via Hong Kong, Chinese banks entered the market to buy, but fortunately, exporters came to sell at the time, and foreign banks were still willing to supply, so the market tightness was limited. At 9:15, British gold had fallen to 4 shillings 6875, and the US dollar was also 7.6875 yuan. When HSBC's listed price was announced unchanged, the silver balance tax was announced to be slightly lower. After that, Hong Kong slightly supplied, and foreign banks were also willing to sell, causing the market to show a firm tone. British gold once strengthened to 4 shillings 71875, and the US dollar also shouted over 7.718125 yuan. Later, it temporarily stabilized. Around 11:00, Japanese banks suddenly came to buy in, and the situation tightened slightly again. British gold reached 4 shillings 6875 again, and the US dollar reached 7.6875 yuan again. However, by noon, Japanese banks stopped buying, and the situation returned to flat. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were: British gold 4 shillings 703125, US exchange 7.71875 yuan, next month's futures British gold 4 shillings 671875, US exchange 7.59375 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous day, both the current and futures British and American currencies were unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Short at Noon</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 23rd: This morning, the exchange market opened flat. The exchange rates of British, American, and Japanese currencies were unchanged. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai rose slightly by one yuan, to 317 yuan. The noon closing showed a softening trend. The British exchange spot exchange rate tightened by 0.03125, to 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 96875. The far-term exchange rate was unchanged. The US dollar spot exchange rate shortened by 0.0625, to 24.5625 yuan. The Japanese exchange spot exchange rate also tightened by 0.25, to 104.25 yuan. The Shanghai exchange spot exchange rate was unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Exchange Rates Loose</p>
<p>Tianjin, 23rd: This morning, the exchange market opened stable. The spot exchange rates for British and American currencies loosened by 0.0625 each. The British exchange rate was 4.5 pence, and the US exchange rate was 7.375 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by half a yuan, to 104.5 yuan. The "Lianchao" gray market was unchanged, remaining at 92.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Premature Market Slump in Gold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market was lackluster. The intraday fluctuations were minimal, but the underlying trend remained stable. This was mainly due to the renewed aggressive selling by a certain gold firm (rumored to be converting into foreign exchange). Furthermore, with the upcoming Christmas holidays in two days, resulting in a three-day break, retail purchases were limited, once teetering on the brink of collapse. Fortunately, Hong Kong investors came to the rescue, limiting the day's decline to only six yuan. As for the intraday activity, although the opening foreign exchange rate showed a slight tightening, gold prices initially dipped by 1200 (12), opening at 4,130 yuan, due to pressure from gold firms and jewelers. However, shortly after the opening, a certain bank's purchases briefly pushed the price up by several yuan. Soon after, the foreign exchange market rebounded, leading to renewed selling pressure from gold firms and others. With few buyers entering the market, the price continued to decline to a low of 4,105 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market tightened again, a certain money changer seized the opportunity to buy at a bargain, and Hong Kong investors also became active, pushing the price back up to 4,138 yuan. However, with the foreign exchange rate returning to level and other firms intent on selling, the price gradually declined. Fortunately, a certain money changer continued to buy on behalf of clients, resulting in a closing price of 4,136 yuan. The afternoon session was quiet, but the underlying trend outside the market turned stable, with the final selling price at 4,145 yuan, and purchases reduced by 5 yuan. The intraday trading volume was approximately 2,000 yuan. Jewelry gold prices remained flat, and customs gold prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Continues to Decline by Six Yuan</p>
<p>The morning's opening situation was weak. Although the foreign exchange rate showed a slight softening, a certain gold firm and jewelers were both inclined to sell, and buyers were scarce. The opening price was pushed down by a small amount, 12 yuan. A certain gold firm sold ten taels to a securities firm at 4,130 yuan. Shortly after, the price dropped another two yuan, with jewelers selling twenty taels to a securities firm for 4,128 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank's buying interest suddenly intensified, purchasing on behalf of clients and pushing the price up by ten yuan. A gold firm sold thirty taels at 4,138 yuan. Soon after, the foreign exchange rate suddenly strengthened, coupled with aggressive selling by a certain gold firm, jewelers, and a certain money changer. Buyers became cautious and watched from the sidelines. Shortly after, the price plunged by thirty-three yuan, with a gold firm selling ten taels to a securities firm for 4,105 yuan. Fortunately, at that time, another money changer seized the opportunity to buy at a bargain, and Hong Kong investors aggressively scoured the market. Furthermore, the foreign exchange rate slightly tightened again, leading to a gradual rebound. A certain jeweler bought twenty taels from a gold firm for 4,138 yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange rate returned to level, and the price dropped again by a small amount, six yuan. A money changer sold twenty taels to a jeweler for 4,132 yuan. Later, a certain money changer returned to scoop up more, lifting the price by four yuan. A gold firm sold ten taels to a money changer for 4,136 yuan, marking the noon closing price. As a result, the price continued to decline by six yuan compared to the previous day, fluctuating by thirty-three yuan intraday. The selling price of spot gold by current gold firms is several yuan higher than spot, and the purchase price is reduced by twenty yuan. The current bidding gold price is more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, and trading is scarce.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Initially Declines Then Rebounds</p>
<p>The quoted price for jewelry gold per tael initially remained at 420 yuan at the major firms. At 10:05 am, it dropped by a small amount, five yuan. At noon, it rebounded by five yuan. There were no further changes after this, and the major firms ultimately maintained the original price of 420 yuan. New firms' prices were comparable to the above, with purchase prices reduced by about fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Bills Alone See Rebound</h3>
<p>Foreign currency trading was scarce yesterday due to the approaching Christmas holiday, reducing interest from speculators, import-export businesses. The market was quiet and unchanged, with only the US dollar bills attracting absorption from customers seeking to trade. The noon price was 12.95 yuan and the evening price was 12.54 yuan, up six fen from the previous day. The supply of Japanese yen bills remained smooth. The market situation was weak, with the evening price at 1.265 yuan. Korean currency was slightly firm, with the evening price at 1.11 yuan. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Firmly Rise</h3>
<p>Business in the rice market is gradually returning to normal. Sales in the market have noticeably increased. With the winter storage season approaching and supplies being cut off for a long time, merchants are all thinking of replenishing their reserves. Therefore, yesterday's market saw a unanimous scramble to purchase, with foreign rice, due to its lowest price, attracting particular attention. Trading was unusually crowded. The initial opening price for Saigon rice was 37.35 yuan. In addition, various types of rice, such as thick and thin glutinous rice, and premium domestic rice, were also offered based on their respective grades. In this way, prices rose steadily, with Saigon rice being bid up to 38 yuan. However, because prices were already very high, merchants were hesitant to act, resulting in a sluggish market for domestic stores. The situation became stagnant. At the close, prices for all types of rice remained elevated compared to before, increasing by about 0.30 to 0.50 yuan, with Saigon rice at 37.50 yuan and Siamese rice at 37.56 yuan. Prices for thick and thin glutinous rice varied depending on the intentions of individual vendors. The total volume of transactions in the city was estimated at 7,000 to 8,000 bags.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of domestic indica rice has not been interrupted, transportation from the Jiangbei area will be difficult in the future, and incoming shipments are expected to decrease again. Yesterday, a little over 1,000 bags arrived from the Jiangbei and Yangtze River areas. The official opening price for formal sales in the market remained at 33 yuan. However, there were no formal transactions for particularly high-quality goods.</p>
<p>Incoming shipments of foreign rice have decreased in recent days, as the early batches have already arrived. Shipments loaded after the 10th and 15th are expected to arrive in Shanghai at the earliest by today or tomorrow. As demand from stores and rural households gradually increases, the market is gradually strengthening. Yesterday, Saigon rice was observed at 37.70 yuan, continuing to rise by a large amount, 0.20 yuan. Original bales of road freight, due to high production costs and unfavorable pre-arranged orders, were not being easily released by sellers. Therefore, yesterday's market had already opened at 45.40 to 45.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Initially Weak Then Stable; Wheat Market Repelled Again</h3>
<p>Flour trading was normal yesterday. Aside from daily needs of local businesses, customer demand was quiet. With the weekend, the Yunnan Uprising Anniversary, and the Christmas holiday approaching, merchants and warehouses were observing. Recycled old brand stacker flour initially declined slightly, but the market rebounded later due to rising prices for rice and oil, attracting some speculative buyers into the market. January futures for Phoenix brand flour from Japanese factories rose from 8.46 yuan to 8.56 yuan. This month's price is also required to be 8.15 yuan, so local factory goods were slightly boosted as well. The total market transaction volume was over 30,000 bags. The price offered by the Second Flour Mill remained at 8.70 yuan. Market changes will depend on what happens after the holiday.</p>
<p>The wheat market was sluggish again yesterday. Although incoming supplies were sporadic, newly arrived goods were unwilling to sell at lower prices due to high costs. Factories found flour prices difficult to improve, and the price of raw materials was being pushed down. Merchants and warehouses were also mostly waiting and seeing, with buying and selling forces evenly matched. As a result, there were no formal transactions. The price of goods sent to factories was rumored to have dropped by two to three jiao, and the market may be expected to decline further in the future.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Market Stable; —Oil Blending— Great Abundance Oil Declares</h3>
<p>The soybean market situation was stable due to a revival of warehouse demand and a shortage of high-quality goods, with mid-grade qualities also slightly lifted. Yesterday, warehouse merchants from this district handled three truckloads of Dingjiazhou beans at 17.70 to 18 yuan, two truckloads of South City beans at 16.50 to 17 yuan, three truckloads of Wuhu beans at 17.30 to 17.60 yuan, and over one hundred bags of Chongming yellow beans at 19 yuan.</p>
<p>Sesame was flat and weak. Foreign merchants were inactive. Local merchants were selectively buying at lower prices. Yesterday, Shantou merchants inquired about one hundred bags of Guandian Snow Sesame at 35.50 yuan, and Guangdong merchants handled over two hundred bags of Jiujiang Milk Sesame at 29.50 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 24th, 1,279 bags of beans were shipped to Xiamen, 3,375 bags were shipped to Singapore, 200 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Singapore, 1,000 tins of raw oil were shipped to Xiamen, and 490 bags of sesame were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<p>After this newspaper published an article on soybean oil being blended with cottonseed oil yesterday, Mr. Jiang Songsan of Dayou Oil Factory came to the office last night to declare that the soybean oil produced by the factory has never sought petty profits and has absolutely never mixed with cottonseed oil. He stated that on-site inspections can be carried out at the factory. Given the reputation of Great Abundance, it can be believed that they would never resort to such tactics. However, the soybean oil sold on the market cannot be guaranteed to be free from blending, which is not something that the factory can oversee.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Compete, Bulls and Bears Both Show No Weakness</h3>
<p>The securities gray market trend continued to increase yesterday, but the increase was not strong. The so-called atmosphere of peace has not been demonstrated, and the exchange is used to hearing this. This has become commonplace, so it is not taken seriously by the general public. Therefore, although buyers are still diligent, sellers are also not showing any weakness. Class B has broken through 50 yuan, showing that views differ and have not converged. Furthermore, with many holidays within the day, both buyers and sellers are slacking off. There may be some fluctuations after the market reopens. Trading was only done for half a day yesterday morning, and stopped in the afternoon. Because next Monday is also a memorial day, there will be two days of market closure, so settlements must be cleared that day. Dingkang buying was more active, and Lianyi Jiufeng also had considerable demand. However, Tongkang Yichang and others continued to sell, and the trend was firm but weak. As a result, the price consistently continued to rise by 0.15 to 0.50 yuan. The total trading volume was no more than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading Transactions: 15 shares of Tianchu MSG Factory stock, priced at 80 yuan.</p>
<p>The Public Association of Industries reported that the optimistic atmosphere of Christmas has greatly helped the stock market, and the closing market was extremely firm. This was especially true for rubber stocks, as sellers felt a great shortage.</p>
<p>London, December 22nd: Today's listed prices for British Far East company stocks only showed that Gulagram Rubber stock fell by 7.5 pence, priced at 22 shillings and a penny. The rest were flat.</p>
<p>London, December 22nd: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds were also flat, with no changes in upper and lower tier bonds.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Raw Cotton Remains High; Yarn Industry Thinks About Standing Firm</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially declined then rebounded. The result was on par with the previous day, with nothing exciting to note. Actual sales remained as sluggish as ever, and there was no progress among all brokers. However, the general industry sentiment was to stand firm because raw cotton remains high. As calculations are pushed forward, factory profits are shrinking daily. Therefore, those who collect and store goods generally remain calm and unmoved.</p>
<p>The opening prices for current yarn this morning were lower, with both the US and Indian cotton markets declining. Market sentiment was peaceful but weak. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 726 yuan, down 4 yuan from the previous day, falling slightly to 724 yuan. But after entering the market, the market situation was flat and hovered for a long time. Then it was heard that a certain prosperous firm suddenly bought dozens of bales of Double Horse yarn. The people's hearts suddenly stirred up, and buying orders perked up again. It slowly rose to 734 yuan. At 11 o'clock, it was heard that the exchange rate was relaxing, and bulls began to sell again, bringing the price back to flat. By closing, it was still at 730 yuan. It was found that the intraday trading volume was close to 1,370 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by 1 yuan, while the rest were flat. The factory, China Textile Factory, offered 200 bales of 10-count Golden Treasure Star yarn at a price of 555 yuan. Today, 5 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Singapore and 40 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amounts bought by each broker are listed below:</p>
<p>Brokers: 910 Hong Kong: 145</p>
<p>Tianjin: 20 Jiangxi: 20</p>
<p>Ningbo: 70 Inland: 225</p>
<p>Total: 1,370</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Neither Flourishes Nor Suffers</h3>
<p>Transactions in the cotton market remained quiet. Aside from some transactions between brokers, other manufacturers did not handle any packages. Most were closing down for the holidays and were increasingly idle. The market situation was neither flourishing nor suffering, and the overall situation was slightly weak. Incoming supplies from Northern Jiangsu included 1,477 bales of Tongzhou cotton and 780 bales of Changyinsha cotton. The current trading situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton: 157.00 Brokers took 170 bales</p>
<p>Also: 154.50 Also: 200 bales</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton: 158.50 Also: 300 bales</p>
<p>American Variety Cotton: 170.00 Also: 170 bales</p>
<p>Another message: Foreign cotton market prices - The New York cotton market was very strong in the initial morning market yesterday. In addition, with purchases from brokers, cotton prices immediately rose by several points. Later, due to the approach of Christmas, all parties took profits and closed. Wall Street also sold, so the market turned weak. As a result, closing prices were down more than 10 points for the near term and 3-4 points for the long term compared to the previous day. Yesterday, India fell more than 10 rupees including forecasts, Egypt rose more than 30 points, and Liverpool rose 4-5 pence.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton market has been coming to a close in recent days, and preparations are being made on how to spend the holidays. They have no intention of trading, so trading is extremely quiet. The factory price of yesterday's cotton, converted using the American exchange rate of 7.6875 yuan, is as follows:</p>
<p>20 count American Mitlin: 235.00</p>
<p>Also Lower Grade: 230.65</p>
<p>32 count Also: 241.90</p>
<p>Also Lower Grade: 235.85</p>
<p>42 count Also: 245.40</p>
<p>Also Lower Grade: 237.60</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Actual Sales Mostly To Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Because the end of the year is approaching and it is time to settle accounts, wholesale business from local stores and inland brokers in the cloth market has gradually slowed down. The sales of local merchants and those from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia account for most of the actual sales, as exchange rates favor exports, and the price of cloth, when converted to the original yarn, is not enough to cover costs. Yesterday, the prices of all goods were stable. Local transactions totaled more than 600 pieces. Fujian brokers handled more than 100 pieces of colored twill, bleached cloth, and fine cloth. Jiangxi brokers handled more than 5,000 bolts of fine cloth, bleached cloth, and serge. Hong Kong brokers handled more than 6,000 bolts of coarse and fine cloth. Tianjin brokers handled more than 100 boxes of plain and patterned taffeta for immediate delivery. Overseas, Mumbai and Singapore handled 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of satin, bleached cloth, and bleached twill. On the 24th, 165 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, and 77 pieces were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth and white goods were sold firmly. The morning opening price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 21.55 yuan per piece. The noon closing price was 21.60 yuan. In the afternoon, Qingdao brokers bought 300-400 packages of mid-range fine cloth brands such as Color Ball, Five Blessings, and Blue Chicken. Local brokers and dyeing factories also had good demand for mid-range goods, handling more than 600 packages of various brands, with Color Ball fine cloth being the most popular, increasing by 0.20 yuan. At the close, Dragon Head was at 21.65 yuan, continuing to rise by 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day. The opening price for next month's Color Ball was 21.75 yuan, and Dragon Head started at 22.60 yuan, rising to 22.75 yuan, with over 200 pieces ordered.</p>
<h3>Paris Cloth Already Fixed</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market remained strong yesterday, with both wholesale and retail transactions robust. Paris cloth for late spring and summer sales already had transactions yesterday, with an initial two loads (?). Over ten cases were traded. The price of Ewo textile was 7.5 yuan, Huntersun was 7.25 yuan, the price of Feixi cargo Li Xing brand opened at 9 yuan, and there was no market for British-made goods. Large wholesalers and gamblers around Qipan Street had reciprocal absorption. It can be said that it is extremely rare for people in the woolen fabric industry in this district to order summer goods for the following year.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: No Transactions for National Sugar; Local Rock and Cotton White Drop by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat and soft. The association's designated price for spot goods of grade 24 coarse white dropped 0.50 to 1 yuan to 58.40 yuan at local warehouses and 59 yuan for newly arrived goods at foreign warehouses. Goods arriving in late July were priced at 58.50 yuan, goods arriving on June 28th were priced at 58.40 yuan, and re-exported goods were priced at 48 yuan. TaiKoo granulated white was down another 0.05 yuan, B mark east warehouse was 58.50 yuan, west warehouse was 59 yuan, CW mark was 58.50 yuan, CX mark was 58.20 yuan, DY mark was 58 yuan, HX mark was 57.80 yuan, H mark carmine (raw sugar) was 45 yuan, and Dutch carmine was 46 to 46.50 yuan. Local cotton white Zhen Ji No. 1 was 58 yuan, No. 2 was 57.50 yuan, No. 3 was 57 yuan, and No. 4 was 56.50 yuan. Local No. 1 rock candy was 68.50 yuan, No. 2 rock candy was 68 yuan, and Jingming rock candy was 70 yuan, all down one yuan. National sugar was reserved, with few offerings and no transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Reports Rise, Silk Merchants Wait and See</h3>
<p>Overseas silk prices for Japanese and American silk remained strong. Near-term prices in New York rose by 0.255 yuan, and long-term prices rose by 0.385 yuan. Current prices for Japanese silk and Chinese silk were also firm, rising by 0.03 to 0.07 yuan. Yokohama rose by 95 yuan, and long-term prices rose by 77 yuan. Because it is the end of the year in the Shanghai silk market, and the silk industry has generally made large profits this year, everyone is holding goods and waiting and seeing. Only 40 dan were traded yesterday. The asking prices have already fallen by about 100 yuan from the highest market price, but everyone is still uniformly optimistic about a price increase.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Preserved Longan Rises by Around Six Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to rising production costs and scarce arrivals, the market price of raw sun-dried preserved longan has repeatedly increased. It was heard that the merchants offered two or three boxes again yesterday, with the price rising by approximately six yuan compared to before, truly representing the highest price of this season.</p>
<h3>Metals: Pure Antimony Plunges</h3>
<p>Previously, due to supply disruptions, there were insufficient pure domestic antimony stocks to distribute to warehouses, so the standard asking price was around 8,000 yuan per ton. However, since recently, due to the easing of restrictions in Hong Kong, supplies have resumed, and warehouses and merchants are rushing to sell. Actual transactions are sparse, with only local furnace factories and porcelain powder factories making small purchases. There are no other significant transactions. The current asking price is 5,000 yuan per ton, 510 yuan per individual box, and only around 260 yuan per dan.</p>

<h3>Life is More Difficult Today Than Ever Before; Wuxi Prices Are Also Surprisingly High</h3>
<p>Wuxi's prices were extremely stable before the war because it could self-supply rice, fuel, vegetables, etc., without relying on others. After the war, the situation completely changed. Imported goods soared in price due to foreign exchange contraction, and rice rose due to merchant manipulation. Other daily necessities were also affected, with prices rising across the board. Currently, tree firewood sells for 1.5 yuan per load, rice straw for 1.2 yuan, soybean oil sells for 1.2 catties per yuan, lard for 1.4 catties, soy sauce for 0.3 yuan per catty, salt for 0.2 yuan per catty, white sugar for 0.5 yuan per catty, local wine for 0.2 yuan per catty, pork for 0.6 yuan per catty, fresh fish for 0.3 yuan per catty, vegetables for 0.04 yuan per catty, radishes for 0.04 yuan per catty, dried tofu for 0.02 yuan per piece, and tofu for 0.01 yuan per piece. All other items have increased two to threefold compared to before the war. The livelihood of ordinary people is worsening daily, and the elderly sigh that they have never heard of or seen such a thing. Before the war, tree firewood sold for 1,200 cash per load, rice straw for 800 cash, soybean oil sold for about 4 catties per yuan, lard for 5 catties, soy sauce for 0.15 yuan per catty, salt for 0.025 yuan per catty, white sugar for 0.2 yuan per catty, local wine for 260 cash per catty, pork for 0.26 yuan per catty, fresh fish for 0.1 to 0.15 yuan per catty, vegetables for 0.02 to 0.03 yuan per catty, dried tofu for 0.01 yuan per piece, and tofu for 0.01 yuan per piece. Comparing the two, the feelings of the past and present are overwhelming. (Hui)</p>

<h3>Singapore—Britain's Far East Fortress—</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Japan's Southern Advance Policy</p>
<p>Although Japan's feet are stuck in the Chinese mainland, it has not abandoned its southern advance policy. In Thailand (Siam), it incites the local government to impose pressure on Chinese expatriates. Its deep penetration into Burma closely monitors the local gasoline-producing areas, and it buys commercial oil mining companies and organizes political organizations locally in an attempt to plot sabotage, provoke discord between the natives and the British government. These are all factual manifestations of Japan's southern ambitions. The targets of these conspiracies are obviously aimed at undermining Britain. Of course, in the current situation, it does not yet have the strength to realize all its ambitions. However, in any case, with such an aggressive force existing in the Far East, Britain is always restless day and night. From Britain's standpoint, in order to prevent the Japanese from pursuing a southern advance policy and preventing the Japanese forces from penetrating into Southeast Asia, it must naturally strengthen China's resistance in diplomacy, deal Japan a fatal blow, weaken Japan's arrogance, and prevent it from being able to divide its forces and promote its aggressive policy to other places. All sorts of facts prove that the interests of China and Britain are consistent. Japan's influence penetrates Thailand, and it is the overseas Chinese who suffer first, but it is the Central Country that is ultimately hit. Political offense is the beginning of Japan's southern advance policy, while military action is the beginning of its ultimate policy and the ultimate goal. This action, if it ever comes to pass, will result in a formal conflict with Britain.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of World War II, many Japanese believed it to be an opportunity of a lifetime. There is no doubt that the Japanese wanted to reap a big profit from the "conflict of the white people."</p>
<p>Singapore's Military Importance</p>
<p>As a result, Britain's fortress in the Far East, Singapore, which controls the gateway between the Far East and India, has naturally become increasingly important in military terms. Since the last war, Britain has felt the need to build a naval port in Singapore. After fifteen years of operation, the current Singapore naval port can already berth Britain's largest warships, and it has also added the largest airfield in the Far East. In addition, long-range artillery is installed around the island of Singapore, which can prevent the invasion of foreign warships. High-altitude guns are also installed to defend against air strikes. Therefore, in recent years, Singapore has become a military center. It is not only the screen for Burma and India, but also an important military liaison station for Macau, the Dutch East Indies, and French Annam. In July of this year, Britain and France held a joint defense conference in Singapore. The British and French colonial authorities agreed on several measures for joint Anglo-French defense: (1) The French aircraft factory in Hanoi cooperated with Australian aircraft manufacturers, and the British and French navies were responsible for protecting French industries in the Pacific; (2) The British Imperial Air Force stationed in Australia could use the French civilian airport in Clitdor; (3) French Annam will participate in the joint defense system of Hong Kong and Singapore; (4) In the event of a war in the Far East, the British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet will be the Supreme Commander of the Anglo-French Allied Forces, with Singapore as the base for joint operations. Based on these important decisions, Singapore has already become a key stronghold for the defense of the British, French, and Dutch territories in the Far East. Its military importance can be understood without saying so.</p>
<p>A Force That Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>However, what we cannot fail to mention is that although Britain and France have made full military arrangements in Singapore and its Far East colonies, and can deal with countries that invade their interests with ease when necessary, what Britain and France cannot ignore and must estimate is that when defending the colonies in the Far East, they must consider China's resistance strength, which is enough to greatly restrain the aggressors and prevent them from launching another invasion - this important factor must be included in the estimate. It is precisely because there is such an important force in China that Japan has not dared to lightly attack Britain and France even now that the Second World War has been going on for several months. This is the reason why Britain and France can rest easy, deal with the European problem, and not have to divide a large part of their forces to defend the Far East. If we understand this, then we can be aware that Britain and France have been secretly hoping to reach various compromises with Japan in China in order to buy Japan's favor and weaken China's power. It's time to wake up and change course.</p>
<h3>Why Did the Admiral Graf Spee Scuttle Itself?</h3>
<p>— (Cao Linyao)</p>
<p>The Admiral Graf Spee was equipped with six 11-inch guns, three fore and three aft. It also had eight torpedo tubes in the stern. Each side of the ship had seven 6-inch rapid-firing guns, fourteen in total. Its main armor was up to eight inches thick, which could not be penetrated by guns smaller than 9-inch caliber. The Admiral Graf Spee was damaged in the stern, where the armor was thin, allowing the British ship Exeter to penetrate it with 8-inch shells. Hitting the ship in the middle would have been impossible to penetrate. Typical 10,000-ton cruisers usually have the following standards: one type with six 9.2-inch guns, ten 6-inch guns, and thirty smaller guns. Another type, less powerful, has sixteen 6-inch guns, fourteen 12-pound guns, and four 3-pound guns. (The above "pound" refers to the weight of the shells.) Why did the German pocket battleship use such large-caliber guns? It reduced the number of 6-inch and smaller guns, using the remaining displacement for 11-inch guns. The weight ratio between 8-inch and 11-inch shells is 1:3. An 8-inch shell can only penetrate armor of 8 inches or less, while an 11-inch shell has three times the momentum and can penetrate 13-inch armor. The armor of most battleships is only 13 or 14 inches thick. In other words, the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee could fight battleships, which ordinary cruisers could never sink.</p>
<p>The general public believes the Admiral Graf Spee was scuttled because a 10,000-ton warship could not fight battleships. In reality, the Admiral Graf Spee had the firepower to fight a British battleship. However, if the British battleship Renown (32,000 tons, 15-inch guns) hit the Admiral Graf Spee, it would have been extremely dangerous because of its smaller size. The Renown could withstand a hit without sinking. Thus, the Admiral Graf Spee was likely to be sunk by the British Renown. Furthermore, the aircraft carrier Ark Royal (25,000 tons) and the French ship Dunkerque (26,000 tons) also had 13-inch guns. Additionally, there were five ships, including the Achilles and Ajax. The strength of their combined firepower was considerable. Although the Graf Spee could target smaller warships, at most it could sink one or two before being sunk itself in the enemy's crossfire. Handing the warship over to another country for safekeeping would have been a loss of national dignity, so it was scuttled and the crew landed. If the British had lost one or two ships, the material loss would only be one percent of their total navy, and the personnel loss would be five per thousand. But if the German ship was sunk, the material loss would be one-fifteenth, and the personnel loss would be one-tenth. Therefore, to conserve manpower, they preferred to scuttle the ship. Material losses can be replenished quickly, but manpower is more difficult to replace. Even one sailor takes three years to train. This is the main reason for scuttling the Graf Spee. (Picture is the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee)</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Name "Jiangxi Province"</h3>
<p>— Gu Zhaowen</p>
<p>The names of most provinces in our country have origins and meanings that can be explained. For example, Jiangsu gets its name from the first characters of Jiangning and Suzhou, and Zhejiang gets its name from the largest river within its jurisdiction, the Zhejiang River. However, the name "Jiangxi" for a province entirely within the Jiangnan region is difficult to understand, and even geography books do not fully explain it. The Yangtze River flows from west to east, distinguishing regions by north and south, not east and west. So where does the name "Jiangxi" come from? After reading "Random Notes from the Liangban Qiuyu Nunnery" by Liang Shao Ren (a Qing dynasty native of Qiantang, styled Yinglai, sobriquet Puzhu, a Daoguang graduate who served as a secretary in the Grand Secretariat), it says that before the Six Dynasties, the "Jiangxi" area included Qin County (now Lu'an), Liyang (now He County), and Luzhou (now Hefei). Therefore, the "Geography" section of the History of the Jin Dynasty refers to the area from Hefei northwards to Shouchun (Shou County) along the Jiujiang River as "Jiangxi". The Yangtze River's flow from Jiujiang to Zhenjiang is roughly north-south. Therefore, the ancient "Jiangxi" was mostly in northern Anhui.</p>
<p>The current province (the ancient Rao, Hong, and Ji prefectures) was called "Jiangxi" because during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty, the empire was divided into fifteen circuits, and the old Jiangnan Circuit was divided into eastern and western circuits. The Jiangnan Eastern Circuit was governed from Suzhou, and the Jiangnan Western Circuit was governed from Hongzhou (now Nanchang). Later, people shortened the names to Jiangdong and Jiangxi. Today, Jiangdong is a historical term, and Jiangxi is no longer west of the Yangtze River but a part of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Yishan Correspondence</p>
<h3>Guangxi Women During the Occupation</h3>
<p>— Hua Weizeng</p>
<p>—A Model for Women Throughout the Nation—</p>
<p>I came to Yishan from Shanghai via Annam for studies, and it has been a month already. From my observations along the way and in Yishan, I feel that the progress of Guangxi's governance today is largely due to the contributions of women.</p>
<p>Most of Guangxi is hilly, with undulating rocky mountains. While the scenery is renowned as the best in the world, the agricultural production is poor. Aside from forests and some plants suitable for sandy soil, the land produces little and is unsuitable for grains and vegetables. Therefore, most residents struggle to make a living. Coupled with the harsh climate (Guangxi is far from the sea, so it has a completely continental climate, referred to as the "miasma rain and barbarian rain region," especially in western Guangxi) and rampant diseases, the most important thing for survival in this environment is the spirit of hard work and endurance. Guangxi women have been forged in this difficult environment alongside men. From the time they can walk independently until their hair turns white and teeth fall out, they are almost always working. As soon as a young woman enters her husband's family, she becomes part of the productive force. They personally handle all work in the fields and livestock raising. It is common to see women from the countryside entering the city to trade, carrying infants on their backs and heavy loads on their shoulders, walking briskly. People from Jiangsu and Zhejiang would be envious and ashamed.</p>
<p>Guangxi women have simple minds and little opportunity for education, but their honesty and chastity are unconsciously cultivated in this environment. Guangxi newspapers rarely report scandalous news. Guangxi men are known as a highly capable force in the army, and while there are many reasons for this, the lack of worries at home is undoubtedly a fundamental one. Unmarried young women also have no vanity, wearing blue cloth clothes and trousers, with large, natural braids. They naturally possess a simple and unadorned quality.</p>
<p>While some women in Guangxi's large cities are becoming fashionable, this is an inevitable trend and is limited to the inner circles of the city. Once outside, most have not forgotten their original appearance. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the trend of extravagance has gradually infiltrated remote villages and towns. With their unique advantages, women only know how to enjoy the fruits of others' labor. In addition, the social customs are degenerating, lacking morality, and incidents of adultery and robbery are common even in peaceful times. Men should be held responsible for this phenomenon, but women cannot escape blame either.</p>
<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>(1) A shop in the western district of Shanghai has a large glass window displaying medicines. A white plum tree is painted diagonally from the bottom up. Upon close inspection at the diagonal line of the glass, it is apparent that the glass is cracked, with the crack also running along the diagonal. The reporter speculates that the glass was cracked before the plum tree was painted. This is an excellent way for the shop to conserve resources, and others in similar situations may want to imitate it.</p>
<p>(2) A member of the Jingwu Athletic Association (who recently joined), is 13 years old, weighs 205 pounds, and is about 5 and a half feet tall. The reporter encountered him in the Jingwu Athletic Association's bathroom three weeks ago. The bathers (also members) were amazed.</p>
<p>(3) The old garbage bridge and Yaxin garbage bridge sections of North Suzhou Creek Road can be called "cotton-snatching and rice-sweeping zones." The area is full of large bank warehouses, and trucks carrying rice, wheat, and cotton pass by every day. Poor people sweep up the fallen rice and wheat to make a living; cotton cannot be dropped, so they take the opportunity to snatch it. It is said that if they are lucky, they can earn one or two yuan a day.</p>

<h3>Leopold III, King of Belgium, Facing Adversity</h3>
<p>— Duxing</p>
<p>Post-War Border Defenses Greatly Strengthened: Glorious Neutrality, Glorious Sacrifice</p>
<p>Thirty-Seven Years of Troubled Life</p>
<p>Leopold III, the King of Belgium, who is only thirty-seven years old and has reigned for only five years, has lived in adversity since childhood. When the German army invaded Belgium in August 1914, he was only a thirteen-year-old boy, pale-faced and lanky, dressed in a sailor suit, often leaning on his mother's knee, and largely unnoticed. He was considered a frail child. However, the tragedy of the four-year war transformed him into a strong-willed and serious-faced man, inspiring awe. After the war, although he was the Duke of Brabant and heir to the throne, he lived a commoner's life until his father, King Albert, died in a fall.</p>
<p>General Post-War National Defense</p>
<p>In the five years that Leopold III has reigned, Europe has been in a dangerous situation. After Hitler came to power amid the global economic recession, he constantly expanded German power, marched into the Rhineland, tore up the Treaty of Versailles, and annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, his momentum was overwhelming. Remembering the lessons of World War I, Belgium worked hard to strengthen its national defense. The Liege fort area, where King Albert led his troops to hold out for reinforcements during World War I, has now been rebuilt into a new line of defense, densely packed with trenches and machine gun emplacements. Behind this fort area is a "Little Maginot Line," built by French engineers. Next is the newly built "Albert Canal," 120 feet wide and 15 to 20 feet deep, with machine guns and cannons densely placed on both banks. National defense is now a hundred times stronger than during the last war.</p>
<p>Glorious Neutrality and Glorious Sacrifice</p>
<p>Belgium was originally a side entrance for Germany into France, and at the same time, its good coastline faced the British Isles. When the German army failed to break through the Maginot Line and desperately needed a submarine base close to mainland Britain, Hitler would not hesitate to manufacture excuses and sacrifice the Netherlands and Belgium. From his childhood experience, Leopold III knew that today was the day for Belgium to choose between glorious neutrality and glorious sacrifice. If the German army invaded Belgium, we would not find it difficult to see this young monarch, drawing on his past painful experiences, raise his arms to resist the enemy!</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Magnetic Mine</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Hitler's Boasted New Weapon</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, German President Hitler boasted that "he would use the latest invented sophisticated weapons to inflict heavy blows on the enemy." What this new weapon was, he did not specify, but in view of the recent threat of German mine laying and the enormous losses of British and French ships, perhaps this mine is the new weapon that Germany boasted about. American military experts are very interested in this, believing that the European war has entered a long-term war pattern, with Britain intensifying its naval blockade and Germany striving to sink ships, which will be the main strategies of both sides. Since Germany laid mines, the whole world wants to know what this mine is like? What kind of power does it have? Newspapers are discussing and speculating. According to the opinion of American army experts, "This mine is laid by airplanes," and there must be a parachute device on the mine. After being dropped from the plane, the parachute opens automatically in the sea, causing the mine to sink and remain in the appropriate position. The most convenient thing about laying mines this way is that any narrow strait, even the mouth of the Thames, can be freely mined. Military experts also estimate that the aircraft used by Germany must be able to carry eight to twenty mines weighing up to five hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Secondly, as for the type of mine, American Navy mine expert Harmon believes that the mines currently used by Germany are just a variant of the "Lyon" mine used by Germany and Turkey in the previous war. He denies the generally speculated theory that it is a magnetic mine. The so-called "Lyon" mine contains 300 pounds of powerful explosives, and its own weight is slightly heavier than the amount of water it displaces. After sinking to a certain depth in the sea, the action of water pressure vibrates the water pressure valve, which connects the electric circuit of the electric motor, and then rotates the propulsion motor, repeatedly rising until it is 18 feet above the sea surface, and then it sinks again. This up and down floating is the characteristic of German mines.</p>
<p>However, some people also speculate that German mines must be a kind of magnetic mine. They believe that this belongs to a kind of fixed mine, and the explosives inside are detonated by the magnetic force between the steel armor of the ship and the laid mine. However, if the distance between the magnet and the target is too far, the effectiveness will be reduced, so the power is not very great. If Germany intends to use it more effectively, it must use various mechanisms to assist it, and this auxiliary mechanism is Germany's latest invention.</p>
<p>The above are the opinions of two factions of American military experts. Judging from the current situation, if Germany is really using magnetic mines, then its structure may be to use a sensitive magnetic needle. Usually, the magnetic needle points north and south, and the mine stays in a fixed position. Once a ship passes nearby, the magnetic needle changes direction due to the attraction of the ship's steel body. The change in the magnetic needle causes the internal electrical mechanism to connect the circuit, rotate the motor, and propel the mine to quickly move in the direction of the ship. It only detonates when it touches the firing pin. Such a mechanism may not be impossible. This is naturally also speculation. What it is actually like, we must wait for expert research.</p>
<p>Now, ships sunk by German mines are reported every day, and even ships of neutral countries are not spared. How to defend against them and how to clear them are the problems that all countries, especially Britain, urgently want to solve now.</p>
<p>Strange News and Oddities</p>
<h3>Chicago, USA, is Built on Coral Reefs</h3>
<p>— Guan</p>
<p>Speaking of Chicago, anyone with a little geographical knowledge knows that it is a world-famous metropolis. Recently, geologists have discovered that many of its strata are composed of coral reefs, some with diameters of thirty feet and some with diameters of three miles. It is said that these reefs formed tens of thousands of years ago when hot currents enveloped the interior of North America.</p>
<p>Coral reefs are created by coral polyps and are common in the sea. However, coral reefs as large as the ones Chicago is built on are rare.</p>
<p>A Funny Anecdote</p>
<h3>Appendicitis</h3>
<p>— Guan</p>
<p>One night, a doctor was awakened from his sleep by a ringing telephone. He got up to answer it.</p>
<p>"Doctor! My wife has appendicitis and is in terrible pain! Please come quickly!" said a young man whom the doctor knew well.</p>
<p>The doctor sighed and told him to go back to sleep. He said, "Give her some ginger soup, and I'll come first thing in the morning. She doesn't have appendicitis!"</p>
<p>The young man became more anxious and insisted that she had appendicitis. The doctor said loudly, "It can't be! I removed her appendix three years ago. A person can't have two appendixes!"</p>
<p>"Can't a person have two wives?" the young man said. It turned out that his second wife had the same problem.</p>
<h3>Sexual Hygiene Leads to Physical and Mental Health</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>The Love Between Husband and Wife Tends Towards Exclusivity</p>
<p>Health is the mother of all successful careers; this is truly a profound statement. British psychologist Brown Sherry investigated 160 couples with waning love and proved that 30% of the reasons for the lack of love were due to economic reasons, 50% were due to health problems, and 20% were due to personality differences. However, the 30% of economic reasons were in fact indirectly caused by health problems, which greatly affected income. Even from the perspective of love, the greatest purpose of marriage is to merge the love between men and women into one and propagate offspring. Therefore, the reproductive function must be healthy and disease-free. The importance of health to marriage is clear. Even studying the happiness and harmonious atmosphere of both parties can only be created by strong couples. If you are with a disease all year round, the joy of singing and following is lost.</p>
<p>Now, to study why married men suffer from kidney deficiency and weakness, this is all caused by premarital non-chastity and bad habits. During development, the most feared is early marriage or promiscuity. The second most feared is self-gratification, which can cause physical weakness, scattered energy, nocturnal emission, and kidney deficiency. If you have this disease before marriage, you should be treated quickly. Before being cured, please do not get married, because marriage will have no love.</p>
<p>The only way to treat this kind of disease is to use endocrine agents for quick treatment. Based on my many years of experience in treating the above symptoms, the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Body Kang," is a genuine youthful hormone preparation extracted from young animals. The inventor, Dr. Meren, has conducted more than 20 years of research and introduced it to the world. It is not only effective quickly, but also reliable in its ingredients. All symptoms such as neurasthenia, premature aging, incomplete development, premature ejaculation, impotence, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency, infertility, pale complexion, old age weakness, winter cold, and weakness of the limbs can be relieved by taking it three times a day. After a month, you will be stronger than ever. It truly has the three major effects of nourishing the brain, nourishing the blood, and nourishing the kidneys. I have used it in clinical practice for seven years and have never encountered a case of failure, so I dare to introduce it to patients. "Body Kang" is divided into male and female types. The female "Body Kang" is a pure ovarian endocrine preparation, which has a magical effect of regulating menstruation and promoting fertility. All uterine diseases will be cured after taking it once. Therefore, "Body Kang" is a good medicine for the family and a guarantee of love.</p>
<h3>Lung Disease and Cough, Dr. Sheng Qiang is the Best</h3>
<p>The lungs are an important organ of the respiratory system. This organ is easily injured due to its important work. If you accidentally catch the flu, it can easily cause a cough. This kind of cough is very stubborn and difficult to cure for a while. Patients often go down the path of tuberculosis because of this. Most people harbor a type of tuberculosis bacillus (i.e., tubercle bacillus). Because of strong resistance, this bacillus can be suppressed. But coughs weaken this resistance. Patients who take the holy medicine for lung disease, "Bu Fei Na Er", to relieve cough and eliminate phlegm can cure the cough in three or four hours and cure lung disease in a short period, thus making the respiratory organs healthy and active. Then the limbs and bones will also be very healthy.</p>
<h3>Curing Gonorrhea without Surgery</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, MD from the United States</p>
<p>Eliminating the Pain of Surgery with a Special Medicine for Gonorrhea - A New Invention Unanimously Praised by Medical Experts from Around the World</p>
<p>Today, disease treatment cannot be based on empty talk or ordinary medicines, nor can it rely solely on surgery. To say that a certain method cures gonorrhea is an exaggeration and not a scholarly attitude. Therefore, I do not adopt this approach. After graduating from medical school in the United States, I traveled to various scientifically advanced countries in Europe to conduct on-site inspections. I knew that Dr. Peter of Germany had invented the special medicine for gonorrhea, "Ke Lin Nong," so I went to Germany to investigate major hospitals. I learned that everyone recommended "Ke Lin Nong" for the treatment of gonorrhea. The director of the Berlin Wupu Venereal Disease Hospital said, "If surgery can be avoided in the treatment of gonorrhea, it is a good thing. However, doctors used to rely entirely on surgery for the treatment of gonorrhea. Now, the treatment of leucorrhea is very different from the past. Now, there is 'Ke Lin Nong,' which can be taken orally and can cure diseases that gonorrhea cannot reach." This shows the effectiveness of "Ke Lin Nong." This agent is made of a mixture of specially made proteome and yellow pigment. It causes a chemical reaction when taken, and its bactericidal power is very strong, but it does not damage healthy tissue. This is its characteristic. "Ke Lin Nong" is made in accordance with science, so there are no impurities left, resulting in no adverse side effects. It can be taken for acute gonorrhea that has just started or chronic gonorrhea that has turned into chronic due to improper treatment. Taking "Ke Lin Nong" during acute gonorrhea can prevent it from turning into chronic. Those who have entered chronic disease can also be completely cured in a short period of time. This is also a characteristic of "Ke Lin Nong." For external use, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used to wash the urethra to remove gonococcus from the urethra. For women with gonorrhea and leucorrhea, "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" can be used as suppositories to eliminate discharge. ("Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is available at Wuzhou Pharmacy)</p>
<h3>Extreme Physical Deficiency Can Cause Nocturnal Emission Even After Abstinence</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, MD from Germany</p>
<p>It is often said that debauchery and excessive self-gratification are the main causes of all weakness. Therefore, in general treatment methods, temporary abstinence is necessary. However, people with kidney deficiency, even if they abstain from lust to maintain their health, will inevitably experience nocturnal emission. After nocturnal emission, the harm is equivalent to debauchery, which is not only not beneficial to health, but in the long run, the kidney deficiency will become more severe. Those who do not know this see the uselessness of abstinence and indulge as before, so their illness cannot be alleviated.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission after abstinence also occurs in healthy people. This is physiological and unimportant. In people with kidney deficiency, due to loose sperm control and oversensitivity of the erectile nerves, semen will leak out during sleep. The treatment method should first stop the nocturnal emission, cultivate and replenish the deficiencies, and abandon stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol. If you are unmarried, you should especially be pure in heart and reduce desires and abstain from self-gratification. Regarding medicines for treating nocturnal emission and cultivation, physicians have experimented clinically and recommend the German medicine for nocturnal emission, "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets." Taking this before going to bed guarantees that nocturnal emission will not occur. At the same time, take the German testicular endocrine preparation for men, "Body Kang," to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, and blood. It is effective very quickly. Taking the two medicines together has the magical effect of curing any serious sexual neurasthenia. Therefore, I am willing to introduce them in writing for patients to use.</p>
<p>A casual talk about gonorrhea</p>
<h3>Can Leukorrhea Be Neglected and Untreated?</h3>
<p>— Written by Physician Yao Juyuan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Why is it that gonorrhea, originally not a difficult disease to treat, eventually becomes difficult to cure?</p>
<p>Gonorrhea should not be treated with an attitude of indifference, but neither should it be ignored with an attitude of negligence. In reality, gonorrhea is not a difficult disease to treat. In my experience of over twenty years, if gonorrhea is treated properly in its early stages and the patient follows the physician's guidelines for health maintenance, then early-stage gonorrhea is truly nothing to worry about! In acute gonorrhea, because the root of the disease is not deep, it is easy to remedy. Generally, after contact with an unclean individual, within three to five days, a urethral itching will occur, causing a burning and stinging sensation during urination. At this time, gonorrhea bacteria are causing a destructive physiological reaction on the urethral mucosa. Afterward, these symptoms gradually become more severe and painful, eventually leading to the inability to urinate and the flow of pus and blood. At this time, the patient becomes flustered and disoriented, seeking only temporary relief from the current pain while neglecting the future course of the disease. The pain of acute gonorrhea is a natural physiological response. Using temporary anesthetics in a vain attempt to relieve pain temporarily is tantamount to weakening the body's physiological resistance, giving the gonorrhea bacteria an opportunity to take advantage. Therefore, the disease will inevitably worsen. In acute gonorrhea, it is best to avoid exertion and use induced static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy alternately. Simultaneously, administer the holy medicine for gonorrhea, 'Kelin Nong,' to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, and relieve pain. This approach not only resolves the pain of acute gonorrhea but also further eliminates all the gonorrhea bacteria. This is the most advanced and effective treatment for gonorrhea, and it is also the most reliable gonorrhea treatment in my twenty years of statistical experience. Twenty appointment numbers sent out daily. Each number costs only five jiao, and includes a free copy of the complete book on venereal diseases. Also treating syphilis, scrofula, chancroid, neurasthenia due to venereal disease, and other conditions. Responsible for guaranteed cure within the specified time.</p>

<h3>Do Not Forget the Yunnan Uprising on Christmas Day</h3>
<p>— Wan Wen</p>
<p>Everyone knows that tomorrow is Christmas Day. Even children with weak memories, seeing the smiling Santa Claus, many interesting toys, and colorful New Year's cards displayed in the shop windows, which are more novel and splendid than usual, will naturally think of Christmas coming. As a result, shops and companies are filled with children, buying toys, candies, and New Year's cards, and are busy exchanging gifts with relatives and classmates, happily dancing with joy all day long. Christmas Day is to celebrate the birth of Jesus, and it should be joyous. While the whole world is rejoicing, children should think about what December 25th actually is. It is true that Jesus was born, but most people have forgotten the birthday of the Republic of China. Now, let us quietly recall! When Yuan Shikai's ambition to become emperor burst forth, Cai E, unafraid of difficulties and tireless, single-handedly overthrew the autocracy and laid the foundation for the Republic of China. This great and heroic revolutionary movement is historically known as the Yunnan Uprising, and it coincidentally falls on the same month and day as the birth of Jesus. Therefore, while happily celebrating Christmas, let us be silent for a few minutes to commemorate the glorious sacrifices of the revolutionary martyrs!</p>
<p>According to custom, people exchange gifts with relatives and friends during festivals to express joy and commemorate the occasion. Tomorrow is Christmas, and I originally wanted to prepare some gifts to share with the children, but unfortunately, prices are so high that it is better to save the money to help the hungry and oppressed refugees. Moreover, material gifts will eventually be damaged and destroyed. It is better to give the spirit of Jesus's universal love and Cai E's fearlessness of hardship. I sincerely hope that the children will accept this and use it as a daily reminder.</p>
<h3>The Story of Santa Claus</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>Christmas is here again! The streets have a new look. In the windows of many shops, a white-bearded old man wearing a red suit and carrying a large package has been added. Do you know who this old man is?</p>
<p>Originally, this old man was called Claus. He lived in the Netherlands in the 6th century. He was very kind and always happy to help others, so people called him Saint Claus. It is said that the red suit he wears was borrowed from Russia. The reindeer and sleigh he carries were given to him by people in Finland who worship him.</p>
<p>His neighbor was a very kind person. He had three daughters, but because of poverty, he had no money to marry them off. When Saint Claus learned of this, he decided to help them.</p>
<p>One day, he secretly walked to the neighbor's window at night and threw in a bag of money. The next morning, the neighbor discovered it and was overjoyed, and married off his eldest daughter.</p>
<p>At this time, his neighbor felt very strange, how could someone always send him money? He decided to hide near the house and watch to see who was giving the money.</p>
<p>Soon, Saint Claus went to send money again. As soon as he threw in a bag of money, the neighbor hiding nearby ran over and knelt before the old man to thank him.</p>
<p>Saint Claus not only sent money to his neighbor, but also often sent gifts to children. On Christmas night, children in the Netherlands often hang an empty sock on the window, hoping that Saint Claus will bring gifts and fill their socks.</p>
<p>Later, the name of Saint Claus slowly spread from the Netherlands to other places, and no child in the world does not welcome him.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Christmas Tree</h3>
<p>— Chen Siyi</p>
<p>Children: The annual Christmas is coming to the world soon; walking past the entrances of major companies, you can see small fir trees, about two feet tall, on display, adorned with small electric lights and snowflakes made of cotton, which look very beautiful. This small fir tree is called a Christmas tree. But, children, do you know the story of the Christmas tree?</p>
<p>Once upon a time, in Alsace, Germany, there was a forest called Hesslach, in which lived a saint named Saint Fulrad, who loved children very much, so the children loved him very much too.</p>
<p>One time, as Christmas was approaching, Saint Fulrad wondered how to entertain the children to celebrate, because he was very poor and could not afford to buy toys to give to the children, and there was no toy store in the forest, so he had to think of other ways.</p>
<p>One morning, he was walking in the forest when he suddenly saw a small fir tree, covered with white snowflakes because it had snowed the night before, and small icicles hanging upside down on the branches, the sunlight shining on the icicles dazzlingly, like diamonds; he saw it and had a wonderful idea. He immediately dug up the small fir tree, took it home, and hung many fruits and cross-shaped cakes made of honey and flour on the branches, and inserted small candles made of gold wax on the top of the tree. Thus, the arrangements were completed, and it was Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>That night, Saint Fulrad entertained many children. The children saw that the small fir tree had golden candlelight shining on the red and green fruits, which was truly colorful and beautiful. Everyone was overjoyed and danced and sang around the small fir tree until late at night before dispersing, their joy unconfined.</p>
<p>From then on, the people of Alsace have always had a small fir tree decorated in their homes when celebrating Christmas; soon, it spread from Germany to the rest of the world.</p>
<h3>A Message to Children</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Before every Christmas, there is a custom in the Netherlands: parents give their children a pig-shaped box made of tile and tell them to save the money they will use for the holiday inside. It is said that if the money is later used for improper purposes, they will encounter great misfortune.</p>
<p>Children! Isn't Christmas coming again? Although your parents may not give you this kind of gift, we should have this intention: that is, never ask our parents for money to buy meaningless things again. "Saving" is the minimum requirement for children in the face of soaring prices.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that all children can automatically make a vow: "This Christmas, I will learn from the Dutch children and not waste a single penny."</p>
<h3>Washington's Christmas Gift</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Washington is the founding father of America. Who knows how he struggled for the freedom and independence of the country regardless of all hardships and dangers!</p>
<p>At that time, the strength of the British army fighting against him far exceeded that of his army. So Washington was driven out of Brooklyn; then he withdrew from New York; to avoid his army being defeated, he retreated to New Jersey; and finally he crossed the Delaware River to find temporary peace.</p>
<p>Many Hessian soldiers, hired by the British to fight against the United States, came to Trenton, a place along the Delaware River.</p>
<p>Washington led his troops and was separated from the Hessian soldiers only by a river. They had lost courage, because they had been driven all the way down from Brooklyn by the enemy army. It was also a cold winter. Not only did they not have warm houses to live in, but they did not even have thicker clothes. They were only wearing old clothes given by the people, and some soldiers had to walk barefoot on the frozen ground.</p>
<p>The Hessian soldiers and some other British soldiers were waiting for the river to freeze, at which time they could advance from the ice. They decided to fight Washington again, preparing to annihilate Washington's army.</p>
<p>At this time, Washington was also thinking about something. He was waiting for Christmas to arrive, knowing that the Hessian soldiers would be having a big feast and celebration on the other side of the river that day.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day Christmas arrived, the Hessian soldiers in Trenton were indeed lively. They drank wine, ate delicious food, and sang loudly. Washington, however, disregarded the cold on the other side and advanced his troops. Some barefoot soldiers left many bloodstains on the snow as they marched.</p>
<p>People and cannons filled many small boats, which had to be pushed slowly with bamboo poles to move. The river was already floating with chunks of ice. But in the course of that night, the small boats, though slow, made several trips back and forth, transporting many people across the river.</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the morning of the day after Christmas, the last batch of American soldiers had crossed the river. It was really cold, and it was still snowing and hailing. Two or three soldiers froze to death.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the morning, Washington and his men arrived at Trenton. The Hessian soldiers were still fast asleep. The drums of the American soldiers woke them up, and they hurriedly jumped out of bed and ran straight into the street, still wanting to fight the American soldiers.</p>
<p>But it was too late. Their cannons had already been seized by Washington and his men. The American soldiers were firing guns at them. They had no choice but to flee into the fields, but unfortunately, they were caught by the American soldiers. The battle ended in a short time, and Washington took more than nine hundred prisoners.</p>
<p>This is called the Battle of Trenton. It made the people of America at the time excited and happy, and this victory was Washington's Christmas gift to the country.</p>
<h3>A Way Out — Episode 48 of Ming'er's Refugee Life</h3>
<p>"It's not a good thing to spend the days so aimlessly." Ming'er's father found the days too boring, so he often grumbled like this. It's no wonder, because from morning to night, he did nothing but eat and sleep, always sitting idly, occasionally reading a book, but the few books he had brought with him as a refugee were soon finished. Sometimes he would go for a walk in the mountains, but it didn't arouse his interest. Moreover, in this village where he had no relatives or friends, he simply couldn't find anything suitable for Ming'er's father to do, and there was no way to do it even in the county town. The money he had brought with him as a refugee was visibly flying out of the box day by day, with no possibility of flying back in. There was only consumption, no production, and the limited money was decreasing as the days went by. Although every expenditure was reduced as much as possible, opening the door every day involved seven necessities. It was tightened to the lowest limit. But no matter what, everyone refused to go hungry. They were only willing to put down their bowls after they were full. Therefore, the daily expenditure was always about one yuan, but the money was being spent one qian at a time. Even if there was a mountain of money, sitting and eating without producing would eventually lead to the "mountain being empty." This problem was a concern for everyone in Ming'er's family, especially Ming'er's parents.</p>
<p>"If we continue like this in this village, there will definitely be a day when we run out of money. What will we do then? When the situation calms down in the future, where will we get the boat fare to return home? Now, while we still have some money left, we should leave this village and look for a way out, otherwise, we will only starve to death here. But should I go alone? Or should the whole family go? Such a large group is always inconvenient, especially at this time of military emergency. If I go alone, what if something unexpected happens to either of us? May it not happen, but what if it does?" This long string of difficult problems came from the mouth of Ming'er's father, who was frowning. Everyone's face showed extreme displeasure. However, in the end, after several deliberations by the father, it was decided that the whole family would leave here. Three months ago, this place was seen as the only human paradise, but now, in the minds of everyone in Ming'er's family, it was a dead village.</p>
<p>When this news reached the ears of the landlady, she expressed her desire for them to stay, but Ming'er's father was very determined to "leave this place." However, this kind landlady made them extremely grateful. She even gave them two huo tong, the only heating devices in the village, as souvenirs. (Huo tong are deeper than ordinary snack baskets, but they have no bottom. The basket contains a tile or tinplate cylinder with a bottom but no lid. Some burning charcoal is placed inside the cylinder, and a lead or copper wire cover is placed over the basket. It is an excellent heating device. It is very popular in this village, because charcoal is the cheapest thing in this village. One yuan can buy two tall and large baskets, more than a hundred jin. In the cold weather, every big, small, old, and young person in the village walks around the streets, putting it under their long robes or skirts to warm their hands, looking as if they have a protruding belly, which is very interesting. Even beggars carry it to beg for food.) The two huo tong that the landlady gave them were woven very skillfully, and the copper wire covers were also very delicate, which made them very grateful.</p>
<p>These past few days, Ming'er's family was again unusually busy. The father went out to inquire about the route. The mother packed and tidied up at home, which took three full days.</p>
<p>On the eve of leaving the village, the landlady kindly gave them a farewell dinner, so they got to taste the flavor of the village again. She also eagerly hoped that they would revisit the old place in the future. They spent the last quiet and cold night in this village. In the dim dawn, they quietly bid farewell to this paradise in troubled times! "May the kind landlady live forever!" This sincere silent prayer came from the hearts of everyone in Ming'er's family!</p>
<p>Goodbye! This group of wandering refugees embarked on a journey to seek survival! (The End)</p>
<h3>The Birth of Jesus and Society (Continued)</h3>
<p>Jesus's intention was not only to release captives but also to actively promote the peace of truth, building the peace of truth and justice on the foundation of righteousness throughout the world, so that all nations, large and small, can share the benefits of freedom and equality. This is God's policy of descending into the world.</p>
<p>(7) To set the oppressed free, the birth of Jesus and the sacrifice of his life on the cross were originally to redeem the people of the world from the power of sin and to obtain a life of wisdom. The standard of social morality revealed in the Bible is righteousness, universal love, and freedom. The task of life is to love people and serve the people, so that people can obtain the life of the kingdom of heaven. Oppression, bullying, exploitation, and encroachment are violations of the above-mentioned standards, the root of all evils, and the source of turmoil. Jesus was born among the oppressed classes in order to redeem those under oppression. The rich bully the poor, the nobles abuse the lowly, the strong bully the weak, and the large swallow the small. This is the same throughout ancient and modern times, in China and abroad. Jesus was born into a poor carpenter's family, like a slave, in order to liberate the poor and enslaved people. He said to his disciples, "I do not regard you as servants, but as friends," and he washed their feet to demonstrate a model for them to follow. Therefore, Paul's epistles also contain a wealth of meaning of freedom, referring to a slave to his master, "He is not a slave, but a brother. If you treat him well, it is as if you are treating me." Abraham Lincoln, the eighth president of the United States, also received this heart and created the great cause of liberation, promoting the civilization of the world. Remembering the source, the source is the birth of Jesus. Because of the birth of Jesus, the value of personality skyrocketed, and the view of life changed. People became the sons of God, and the world was transformed into the holy curtain of God, like the song of the angels: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." The scripture says: "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth, giving people new life to attain abundance and eternal life." The End</p>

<h3>Christmas Gifts and Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Every year at Christmas, Hollywood movie stars receive a large number of gifts, most of which are sent by fans from all over the world. Recently, an American film magazine compiled the following statistics on the gifts received by several relatively well-known movie stars around this holiday in recent years:</p>
<p>Shirley Temple: The value of Christmas gifts given by fans averages over US$300,000 each year.</p>
<p>Ann Miller: She is famous in Hollywood for her toe dancing, so shoes are always the most numerous among the gifts sent by fans from all over the world each year.</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin: In her spare time, she often enjoys playing table tennis, so she receives many different kinds of ping-pong balls or rackets among the Christmas gifts she receives each year.</p>
<p>Charles Laughton: He is known as the only "flower lover" in Hollywood. Fans from all over the world are also very good at catering to his wishes, so he rarely receives other gifts during Christmas.</p>
<p>Miguel Molina: Anyone who has been to Hollywood knows that he is a sports fan. He likes to play soccer, tennis, volleyball, etc. Therefore, the best way to get close to him is to send him a ball on Christmas.</p>
<p>George Brent: It can be said that no movie star receives fewer Christmas gifts than him each year. He has a strange temper, which is that he doesn't like people flattering or praising him. It is said that he even refuses to have his name published in the newspaper sometimes.</p>
<p>Sidney Toler: Since the death of Warner Oland, he has been playing the role of the Chinese detective Charlie Chan on the screen. Because of this, his name suddenly became famous; also because of this, the gifts he received from fans last Christmas were almost all Eastern-themed.</p>
<p>Others, such as Wallace Beery and Victor McLaglen, so-called rude stars, never receive gifts such as handkerchiefs, perfumes, or new clothes around Christmas every year. Conversely, stars who are considered noble and refined, such as Myrna Loy, Norma Shearer, and Marlene Dietrich, always receive the above-mentioned items every year.</p>
<h3>Talking About the "China Travel" Revival</h3>
<p>— Jin Yuanliang</p>
<p>The China Travel Drama Troupe, which has returned to Shanghai after a three-year absence, will be performing at the Palace Theater starting today. The "China Travel" has a so-called "red background," and this time it has returned with a more complete lineup than before. A grand success is naturally within expectations.</p>
<p>The first performance of "China Travel" this time happens to coincide with Christmas, and Christmas also happens to be our National Revival Festival. Tolstoy's "Resurrection" has some religious overtones, which is similar to how Christmas is not just for Christians today. There is a wonderful similarity. And looking at the connection between the title "Resurrection" and our national destiny, it can be said to be the ultimate in good wishes and prayers. Performing this play on the National Revival Festival makes us smile knowingly.</p>
<p>Moreover, this performance of "Resurrection" is entirely for raising funds for refugees.</p>
<p>Following "Resurrection," it is said that Wei Ruhui's "Empress Dowager Cixi" will be staged starting on New Year's Day next year. Director Wu Yonggang and Mr. Wei are collaborating again. In terms of actors, in addition to Tang Ruoqing and others who will be fully mobilized, Wang Xichun, Liu Qiong, and others will be specially invited to perform as guest stars. Also, Ms. Xiangqing, Ruoqing's younger sister, will also play a role in "Empress Dowager Cixi." Xiangqing has never acted in Shanghai. According to outside opinions, her acting skills are not inferior to her sister. "Empress Dowager Cixi" will give us proof.</p>

<h3>Snippets from Guohua</h3>
<p>— Yixin</p>
<p>"Li Amao and Miss Tang" has been released at the Jincheng Theater. Miss Tang is a reporter for the East China Radio Station. It is said that Guohua will use Li Amao as the backbone of comedy films, hoping to compete with Mr. Wang in the Shanghai film scene. This film is its starting point. Following this will be "Li Amao and Dongfang Shuo," opening a new era of ancient costume comedy films.</p>
<p>Gong Jianong plays Niu Ba, who advocates polygamy. In the play, in order to marry Miss Tang, he has to shave his beard. It is said that he entered the mainland after the war and has been growing a beard for more than two years. This time, he sacrificed for the film, which is quite regrettable. Li Amao comforted him and said, "A little beard is nothing to worry about."</p>
<p>The plot of "Hero of Troubled Times" is progressing calmly and unhurriedly, with unexpected twists and turns, making it wonderful and unpredictable. The filming period is particularly long due to the large sets and numerous battle scenes.</p>
<h3>"Art World" Publication</h3>
<p>The comprehensive "Art World," which combines film, Peking opera, music, dance, and illustrations, will be published tomorrow. The authors include Fei Mu, Zhou Xinfang, Lang Jingshan, Tang Qiaosi, and dozens of other experts, totaling tens of thousands of words. The photographs include dozens of pictures of leading famous actors, movie stars, and Chinese and Western film stills. The color cover features Chen Yunshang and Zhou Xuan, making it the most exquisite pictorial seen in recent years. Each copy costs forty cents and is available at newsstands, cinemas, and major bookstores at home and abroad.</p>
<h3>Welcoming the Holy Banquet Dance</h3>
<p>On Christmas Eve, Shanghai will unfold a grand and joyful spectacle. The Cale, the Hall of Music, new dance halls are opening, the Dahua, the Xuan Palace, and theatrical venues are emerging, the city is adorned with fresh street scenes, New Year's gifts, entertainment, banquets, and recreation, it is a message that, on the eve of Christmas, the New Capital Hotel will be open all night, the Glass Radio Station will broadcast exciting programs all night, and all restaurants will hold a "Welcoming the Holy Grand Banquet Dance."</p>
<p>Regarding the programs of the Glass Radio Station, there will be a "Sunday Children's Christmas Broadcast," followed by the Shanghai opera performances by Wen Bin and Chun Xuan, a grand gathering of Lingnan female singers, a Yue opera concert by Deng Shuyi, a rehearsal by the Golden Society's New Era Women's Peking Opera Troupe, and an addition of the complete children's Peking Opera rehearsal "Song Shi Hui," a joint performance by all the famous storytellers of Guangyu Society, and the famous female storyteller Zhao Meifang personally directing "Falling Golden Fan."</p>
<p>This can be said to be the grandest event in Shanghai's entertainment circle to celebrate Christmas!</p>
