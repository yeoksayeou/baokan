<h3>芬蘭軍奮勇抗戰　各路蘇軍攻勢被遏阻　貝柴摩港克復蘇軍百餘被俘　喀萊里亞地頸激戰在進行中</h3>
<p>挪威京城　芬蘭軍隊規復該國北部貝柴摩港、並俘獲蘇聯士兵一百五十名一項消息、已由該國當局正式予以證實、該國難民之逃入挪威國者不絕於途、其中多係老弱婦孺之流、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑞士京城　「巴塞爾晚報」駐瑞典京城訪員頃來電稱、蘇聯騎兵企圖在拉多加湖北面包抄芬蘭軍隊後路、已被擊退、芬蘭軍現正憑藉森林湖沼堅守、蘇聯坦克車無法衝入、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>芬京　此間公報稱、蘇聯軍隊在東南邊界終日活動、允以在拉多加湖一帶爲甚、該處戰事甚爲劇烈、但進攻蘇軍悉被擊潰蓋爲芬蘭新式來復槍專用於森林戰事者所創也、若干村鎭亦燬於火、芬軍損失甚微、喀萊里亞地頸之戰事、亦甚猛烈、除數處外、敵軍亦被擊退、雙方現猶在戰爭中、蘇方昨喪失坦克車十一輛、今日至少又喪失坦克車八輛、蘇聯飛機今日喪失九架、而芬蘭飛機則皆安然飛回云（一日路透電）</p>

<p>芬京　北部貝柴摩港規復之訊、已經證實、人民間悉之餘、咸皆忻忭鼓舞、至以前錢形勢而論、芬蘭國軍隊所據陣地、迄仍在馬納漢防綫前面云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>芬京　芬蘭北極海岸之貝柴摩港、連日經過繼續不斷之空襲後、卒於昨日被蘇軍佔領、故目前芬蘭之整個北極海岸、概在蘇軍手中、該港地位雖非十分重要、但蘇聯佔領之目的、顯在截斷外國軍火輸往芬蘭之進口、（二日海通電）</p>
<p>芬京　昨日芬蘭獲勝之消息中、有擊毀蘇聯坦克車三十六輛一條、於此可見配備精良的芬蘭軍隊戰鬥精神之一斑、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>荷京　據「希特伏爾克報」訪員電稱、芬蘭砲隊射擊之準確、已使各外國觀察家留有良好印象、命中百分率之髙、殊出人意料云、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>蘇軍攻芬戰略</p>
<p>瑞士京城　「德意志通信社」頃自莫斯科發來消息稱、蘇聯軍隊向芬蘭進攻者共分四路、（一）自該國北部茂曼斯克港西進、以冀切斷芬蘭國北部通海道路、（二）自喀萊里亞區向芬蘭中部進攻、（三）自拉多加湖岸出發、以包抄喀萊里亞地峽方面之芬蘭軍、自列寗格勒城北面逕向該地峽猛撲、以期擊破芬蘭「馬納漢防綫」主力戰或當在此發生云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>天空濫肆轟炸</p>
<p>芬京　今日下午一時後、蘇聯轟炸機攻擊芬蘭海岸防禦工事、及沿喀萊里亞地頸全部之各城鎭、而渶戈島南海岸亦曾炸及、聞至午後四時蘇機猶不斷轟炸、芬京以北各大路有避難者盈千累萬、彼等夜宿於森林中及路旁、永雪載途、交通困難、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>芬京　總司令部頃發表第二號戰報稱、蘇聯飛機本日曾在我國京城·桑蒂姆城·孟克那斯城·瓦薩港·土庫港·賴希城·泰奇福爾斯城·薩爾梅傑維城·霍格蘭島·漢哥島·曁維波格港等處、肆行轟炸、曾被我方高射砲隊擊落兩架、一架落於桑蒂姆城、另一架落於孟克那斯城、某處有一工廠爲炸彈所中、致有工人十八人慘遭非命、蘇聯飛機並在霍格蘭島投下燃燒彈多枚、薩爾姆傑維城某大橋已被炸毀、當其轟炸京城中、並用機關槍向無辜平民掃射、京城居民正在加緊疏散中、漢哥島在一日之中、會被轟炸三次、維波格港則於被轟炸之後、發生大火多起、迄今尙在燃燒中、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>芬京　據今日此間消息、芬京及許多其他城市昨日雖遭空襲、惟損失甚微、聞在昨日戰事中、共擊落蘇機十七架、其中六架係芬蘭空軍上尉一人所建之功、據喀萊里亞前方報吿、過去兩日中蘇聯坦克車之被擊毀者不下十九輛之多云、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>芬京空襲警報</p>
<p>芬京　芬京居民昨晚度過安靜之一夜後、今晨八時三刻復爲空襲警報所驚擾、男女市民紛紛擁入防空壕避彈、各市街不久即荒凉無人、但此次警報顯係誤發、因五分鐘後即行解警、芬京人口或將隨時被迫疏散、各大商行多已撤至其他城市、目下食糧準備尙甚充足、惟各食物肆均不按時營業、一聞警報立即閉門、當日即不復再開矣、</p>
<p>芬京　本城東端、曾發生驚人慘劇、蓋有多數人民擁集大方塲中、冀免葬身瓦　，不料蘇機向人叢中投下數彈、蘇機飛行甚低、掠屋頂而過、向驚惶奔避之軍民開槍掃射、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>蘇艦擊沉一艘</p>
<p>芬京　芬蘭方面聲稱、轟擊魯薩羅砲台之蘇聯驅逐艦三艘、已被芬方擊沉共一、砲台與蘇艦開砲互轟、歷午後半日之久、喀萊里亞地頸之郁克塞加邊境雙方交戰時、芬軍擊毀蘇方坦克車十輛、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此聞頃接獲瑞典國京城消息、據稱、蘇聯巡洋艦「季羅夫」號昨日轟擊芬蘭漢戈島時、曾被芬蘭海防砲隊擊中一彈、因而受有損害、但未沉沒、另有蘇聯驅逐艦一艘、則爲芬蘭國砲臺所擊沉、此外、據芬京消息、蘇聯步兵兩營已爲芬蘭國軍隊所殲滅、此項部隊來自歐斯德波登區、其地居民素以捕海豹爲生、長於射擊、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫　勸美置身事外　答復羅斯福總統呼籲　謂院隔重洋安知真相</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯政府昨日以言語唐突之聲調、答復羅斯福總統所作蘇聯軍用飛機不炸芬蘭平民區域之呼籲、蘇聯牒文勸吿美國對蘇芬戰事置身事外、蘇聯人民外交委員長莫洛託夫、昨日中斷與日本駐蘇大使東鄉茂德商務談判、以便接見美國駐蘇大使斯坦哈特、莫洛託夫答稱、羅斯福總統牒文「毫無根據、且基於誤會」、渠稱、美國離蘇聯八千六百里、故不能確定蘇聯之眞目的、及芬蘭國內之事變、渠否認蘇聯飛機轟炸芬蘭任何城市、蘇聊並無轟炸芬蘭城市之意、因蘇聯政府重視芬蘭人民利益、與他國之態度相埒、蘇聯飛機僅炸芬蘭飛機塲而已、（二日合衆電）</p>
<h3>瑞典或將　出面調停　挪論輿譴責蘇聯</h3>
<p>瑞士京城　頃悉瑞典政府對於芬蘭蘇聯兩國衝突、或將出面斡旋、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>奧斯陸　挪威報紙今日一致譴責蘇聯之攻擊芬蘭「台恩報」稱、北歐人民將不忘此慘痛時期、蘇聯侵犯芬蘭之舉動、創立卑陋在躁之新紀錄云、（一日路透電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇聯動態的剖析</h3>
<p>由蘇聯的進攻芬蘭，說明了兩個月來蘇聯招致芬蘭談判，不過是一種幌子。現在戰爭爆發纔三日，但以蘇聯的龐大强悍，處心積慮；以芬蘭的弱小，雖竭全力亦不足以抗衡，何况內部還有出賣祖國，勾結暴鄰的黨徒從中作祟。更逢歐洲大陸，戰雲瀰漫，强國不暇他顧，弱國惴惴惟恐不能自保，故國際利害恩怨雖錯綜複雜，而芬蘭却是呼籲無門。因此種種，我們不必等待蘇聯佔領了芬蘭全部，不妨大胆預言芬蘭勢必無幸。或許有的希望：其一，蘇聯對芬蘭，無論在軍事上政治上形式上精神上，絕對沒有兼併的野心，祗是攫取了三五處軍略地點，據爲已有，而容許芬蘭依然保持其爲絕對獨立自由的國家；其二，蘇芬戰爭相當持久，不待蘇聯獲得全勝，而戰爭範圍却已無量延擴，使蘇芬戰爭成爲世界戰爭中的一小部分，兩國不能自行解決此一局，而待人類思想的整理，國際原則的確立。總之，待世界的總解決。這兩種希望，本質上原非絕不可能，但我們仍覺得希望異常渺茫。一個新興而精緻的和平國族，忽遭類似乎不可抗的浩劫，恰如英雋挺秀的少年，驟罹惡疫，藥石無靈，命在旦夕；凡有正義感的人們，誰不爲掬同情之淚！</p>
<p>蘇聯這一决舉動，所予世界心理輿情的刺激，幾乎無辭可以形容其强烈的程度。我們歷來對芬蘭相當隔膜，無論在文化上政治上商業上，任何關係，可以說幾等於零；相反的，對蘇聯則就物質精神感情各方面言之，遠較芬蘭爲深切。但是深切的友誼仍不能動搖良知所判斷的是非，而强烈的刺激則惟有根據深切的友誼而抑制其橫溢的反應。因此之故，對於當則的蘇芬問題，與其加以嚴正的批評，不如試作側面的說明。</p>
<p>分析蘇聯的動態：他以爲目前的歐戰，是帝國主義的第二次世界大戰，而且這世界大戰並不始於今日，入年前的九一八事件已經是這大戰的肇端了。不過從九一八事件以後的義阿事件，西班牙事件，德國佔領捷奧，以至束方的中日戰事等，那是帝國主義對弱小民族弱小國家的侵略；而現在的歐戰却是帝國主義的自相火併，也就是世界戰爭的一個新階段。在前一個階段上·蘇聯的策略是組織民主國家與弱小民族的聯合陣綫，反對侵略的法西斯主義；在目前的新階段上，蘇聯的策略却轉變了，他憎惡法西斯的帝國主義，更僧惡反法西斯的帝國主義，這當然不因爲法西斯的理論精神，差勝於反法西斯，使蘇聯之所憎惡，發生程度之差；却以蘇聯爲本位，以共產政制爲本位，權衡利害重輕，分別應付緩急，遂辨以親疎，演爲友敵。最刻薄的見解，以爲蘇聯的親疎友敵，促成了歐戰，甚至希圖播弄成爲世界大戰。其實法西斯與反法西斯矛盾的存在，終必交戰；其交戰範圍，或爲數國，或爲全歐洲，或爲全世界，亦完全繫於矛盾的雙方；無待局外的蘇聯來促成或播弄。蘇聯祇是抓住了目前新階段的機會，絕不猶疑，絕不放鬆，幹了幾椿最有利於其本位的事情。務求最有利於其本位，是最基本的意願；所謂前階段的策略與現階段的策略，已經轉變極大的角度，甚至再有更大角度的轉變，都是不必驚駭，亦是不算神奇；因爲任何轉變，任何策略，無一違反其務求貫澈其意願的一貫精神！恰逢法西斯領袖垂涎於每一顆栗子，且有火中取栗的大無畏精神；於是相得益彰，演爲目前如火如荼的局面。</p>
<p>蘇聯往年因爲窮困，乃宣示改變作風，以不向他國積極推銷共產政制，換取了國際資力，於是一五一十的建設：這種宣示，原來不能注銷其政制超國家的本性。本性如、此，故瓜分波蘭，進攻芬蘭，在彼主觀上千是萬是，絕無不是。更準確的說：關於波蘭，世人以此爲蘇聯與德國瓜分，而在蘇聯方面，並非所謂瓜分，僅以爲當時的環境形勢，在事實上祗宜超越其原來的疆界而至現在所佔領的疆界爲止：至於剩餘的部分，並非認爲由瓜分而歸之德國，祇視爲未歸蘇聯罷了。關於芬蘭，世人以蘇聯所謂感受芬蘭威脅，乃是蘇聯無恥的僞言：其實並非偽言，共產政制的蘇聯，確是認爲境外的非共產政制國家，盡是對蘇聯的威脅者，芬蘭是威脅蘇聯的一方面而已。假使說：赤道實威脅了寒帶，南冰洋將威脅北冰洋，這在蘇聯的邏輯上，決非不通的。根據這邏輯，擴展國防到他國境內，構成他國內部的階級鬥爭，旣足以增强蘇聯的安全，又足以削弱對蘇聯的威脅，皆屬蘇聯情理之常，亦是國際題中應有之義！</p>
<p>友法西斯利，則友法西斯；取芬蘭便，則取芬蘭：利與便是蘇聯凡百動態的原則。若達反利與便的原則，而參加現階段戰爭的任何一方面，乃爲蘇聯所必不爲。若英法恐蘇聯參戰，這是杞人之憂。若日本想蘇聯捐棄其本位，相與勾結，則限於日本確是具有與其他帝國主義相「火併」的決心，而又不至養成日本對蘇聯威脅的可能，增加日本對蘇聯威脅的地盤與力量，爲其必要條件；日本無此決心，犯此條件，則想勾結蘇聯爲妄想。中國所由能與蘇聯保持友好關係，在於中國根本充溢了無威脅的中庸性。</p>
<h3>芬蘭新內閣成立　願覓取榮譽的和平　以不損獨立主權為條件　暴力侵略必出全力抵抗</h3>
<p>芬京　買何德內閣辭職之後、頃山林蘭銀行總裁里蒂組織新閣、業已成立、閣員人選如次、</p>
<p>總理里蒂（芬銀總裁）外長丹納（前任財長）內長鮑恩（瑞典族人民黨領袖前任不管部閣員）</p>
<p>國防長紐嘉能（速任）財長潘加拉（前任農長）</p>
<p>司法長蘇杜漢姆（瑞典族人民黨領袖）</p>
<p>不管部閣員巴錫基維（前任駐瑞典公使）（一日哈瓦斯電）按新任總理里蒂、在政治上並非著名之士、外長丹納前任財政部長、爲社會民主黨領袖、曾出使蘇聯、參加莫斯科談話、新內閣令人注意者、厥爲駐瑞典公使巴錫基維担任不管部閣員之職、按巴錫基維即參加莫斯科談話、担任首席代表之人、（一日海通電）</p>
<p>紐的　前任芬蘭國家銀行總裁現任國務總理之里蒂、今日發出廣播聲稱、「吾人願談判所有之各問題、但不凖備放棄吾人之獨立、或放棄吾人决定自已己事務之權、」又稱、「芬蘭人民要求繼續完成其政治獨立之權」、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>又該國駐美公使阿斯脫隆亦向此問報界發表談話稱、我國新內閣乃包括各黨各派之聯合內閣、仍常推行獨立自主的中立政策、蘇聯在吾國境內所設立之「傀儡政府」、足以證明該國外交人民委員長莫洛托夫前此所發表之宣言價値如何、一言以蔽之、蘇聯所行政策、乃欲將芬蘭國併入該國版圖、而賦以布爾希維克式的自由權而已云（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　芬蘭新內閣成立之後、此間消息靈通人士頃談稱、新內閣雖凖備與蘇聯當局進行談判、覓取榮譽的和平、但蘇聯倘若賡續侵略、則芬蘭仍當堅决抵抗到底、觀於蘇聯已在喀萊里區域組織「芬蘭革命政府」、可見芬蘭擬向蘇聯提出榮譽和平條件、其成功希望至爲渺茫、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>丹納外長　發表談話</h3>
<p>丹京　芬蘭新任外長丹納、昨日接見丹京「社會民主報訪員發表談話、宣稱、「上屆政府認爲局勢過於嚴重、惟有辭職以讓賢能、組織各黨聯合政府、吾等之强鄰蘇俄欲消滅芬蘭民族、强迫吾等接受所不能接受之條件、此項局勢正賴新政府加以廓淸、吾等將盡力尋求對蘇諒解是否可能、吾等以保障芬蘭之獨立及安全、爲新政府之惟一問題、共他問題一概置諸其决」云、（二日海通電）</p>

<h3>今日無如吃飯難　油米粉麥大貴特貴　人生到此天道寗論</h3>
<p>人生所不可一日缺者、柴米油鹽、在上海人生活中、柴尙占其决要但亦只一元八箍、戰前固一元可買十念箍最普通之燃料爲煤球、近因新廠競爭之故、一度低落、至前日一漲再漲、七十元一噸、三元八角一擔、鹽以私鹽充斥、尙稱便宜、米則不堪設想、狼狽爲奸、囤戶拉抬允力、易漲難跌、無論社會人士、口誅筆伐、烏能動其毫末、連日頻頻上漲、至昨日常頂粳竟開四十一元、昆山粳米亦在三十九元以上、出新旺期、來源如此、不有歹人從中搬運、不有奸商趁火打刦、市價决不至糟到如此地步、所苦者上海人的困雞、竟無有加以注意、因此操縱之膽量愈大、不斜油價操縱、更形劇烈、自從德國開戰、國內食物之補充、乃大事購買東三省大豆、與日方訂購一百萬噸、由西伯利亞鐵路運德、蓋黃豆固可作食料、又可製油、及人迭白脫油、復可從油中提煉汽油（搿司林）、因之日商將黃豆豆油大事搗把、上海油商加緊囤積、到昨日靑島豆油竟出百元關、粉麥行情、明日有再漲之說、看到這種情形、上海一般平民生活、將有「人生到此、天道寗論」、之感、詳細情形請看後開、</p>
<p>杜米行市、以到源不旺、至今仍在魔手把持之下、囤戶遂施展其手腕、連日大漲小回、晨跌夕漲、幾成常事、蓋囤戶所以敢操縱者、（一）利用其供給而需要旺、（二）利用各物皆貴聲中不安定之人心、（三）則賴有令融　爲之後盾、一副本錢、可以三副作用、昨日河下到船似稀、車輪包子自蘇同崑太等貨裝到十四五車、其初銷塲尙有限、但以外匯黃金上漲、竟爾激動人心、作客意興復起、大凡一經動辦、則此搶彼奪、惟恐落後、客販喊聲遂髙、市價又見新高價、常頂粳曾喊過四十三元、收盤爲四十一元、常州市粳亦叩四十元關、開三十九元、結果厚粳薄稻蘆洋失等貨、統漲一元五角至一元不等、全日成交的一萬五六千包之譜、</p>
<p>客秈到頭漸湧、江北一帶漸有二三千包之整批到滬、京蕪各地亦復源源抵埠、且有洋米大量定到、市面似可逐步轉平、奈在物價騰漲之際、業內外人心一致向上、鄉客作舖添辦外、囤戶更貪、再以滙縮金漲、洋米劃昂、客秈又被抬高一元外、江北京蕪各秈均昂至三十六元許、成交有三千多包、</p>
<p>洋米到頭絡繹不絕、除香港轉到外，西貢方面亦複接連來滬、然金漲滙縮、後定再昂、安南粳乃大至三十六元半、西貢亦至三十六元左右、惟新交易昨又有二千噸成議、計建源一號五百噸、價四十一元二角、達孚一千五百噸、二號價三十九元七角、一二號三十八元二角云、</p>
<p>麵粉昨日步步昂挺、自回盤漲至七元乃角後、廠籠貨已越八元大關、皆因金市在漲、外滙緊縮、兼之小麥原料飛漲、竟達十三元之髙峯、所以人心日昂、賣方堅持、各廠爲維持本街起見、仍照七元八角原盤零星供應、客銷則已停止出售、聞回籠貨砲車脾等、已抬至八元二三角、內地雜牌粉亦受本客歡迎、售價亦到七元三四角、市面環境頗佳、恐下週初八元之廠盤、勢必實現、</p>
<p>小麥趨勢、扶搖直上、聞蘇常一帶、略有少數抵埠均被客囤居奇、不願出樣脫售、各廠進胃甚佳、尙擬擇巧而取、但市面早被環境所激起、聞昨日市塲成交蘇常等麥十車、價已再創十三元之髙峯、又聞廠方亦巳接受十三元之價、尙未正式成議、市面開展、當待諸下週初、</p>
<p>豆油來源、仍止簍裝油陸續有到、但一時難解人心恐慌鐵桶油雖有應市、然驚人昨舌之售價、實空前所罕聞、昨靑島油竟達一百零三元、其他各油之行市、比前市劇漲七八元不等、計開靑島油十五桶、價爲一百零三元、烟歧油一百件、價爲八十元、本廠油一百擔、價爲八十三元、膠州油路貨二百件、價爲七十七元、靑歧油路貨二百件、價爲七十八元、</p>
<p>花生油乃依豆油作轉移、故行情續跟砌三元、計成交膠州油三百件、價爲七十五元、江北桶油七十桶、價爲九十六元、天津桶油五十桶、價爲九十七元云、</p>
<h3>金融　棉麥外滙結果款殊鉅　巿勢已連緊六天　期貨亦不乏結進</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌俱無上落、英美匯暗市、乃因週六祇半天買賣、故情形更現緊張趨勢之堅俏不回、迨本日已達六天、而昨日暗市、已較滙豐掛脾爲軟、推厥原因、蓋由近數日內市上謠諑時興、人心忐忑、投機者故技復施、推波助瀾、且其他經營者、每都跟風扒結、更有進口商之棉花小麥結款、而另一方面、銀行欲賣、亦多數討價、供求自然難平、前途尙不易揣測、當日過程、初開因美英匯兌回長一分八七五、英美遂緊〇三一二五、價爲四辦士六八七五、及七元六二五、嗣華商與洋行界互相扒進、後洋麥結款亦多、棉紗帮追踪力吸、聞日商東棉與福家洋洋、均有扒入、加之華銀行曁匯豐咸有吃胃、中途雖曾略定、奈至午刻、已吿四辦士四三七五、與七元一八七五緊價、及至午收時、英金尙吿四辦士四六八七五、美匯爲七元二五、較上日英緊二五、美軟三四三七五、至期貨市勢、與現貨稍形軋攏、情况則無分軒輊、</p>
<p>外銀行賣意淡薄</p>
<p>晨以初以倫敦大條、近遠均平、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·對法俱仍平定、對滬縮〇六二五、美對英回長一分八七五、對滬小二角、對法大八七五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士六八七五、美匯七元六二五、較前收英聚〇三一二五、美反硬〇三一二五、乃匯兌回長之故、開後華商首來扒進、兼華商洋行及日洋行亦爭先購結、故市象即見步軟、英金由四辦士六二五至五六二五、美匯由七元五六二五遠四三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後一度稍定、但不久終因扒風又起、時某麵粉廠亦入市扒結、且紗花帮與日商東棉及福家洋行、亦前來競買、同時華行上海與日行等亦力向期貨方面猛扒、加以外行仍少供意、且傳匯豐亦有吃胃、故市象遂步緊加厲、迨至午刻、英金祇四辦士四三七五、美匯僅七元一八七五、且聞有少數成交、惟午收稍穩、銀行現貨賣價、英金計四辦士四六八七五、美匯計爲七元二五、十二月份英金四辦士四三七五、美滙七元一八七五、結果比上日現貨英緊一五、美軟三四三七五、期貨英貴二三四三七五、美縮三一二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>港滬滙兌又猛升</p>
<p>香港二日電、今晨匯市開盤平平、英匯現期貨均不動、仍開一先令二便士九六八七五、美匯現貨鬆一二五、爲廿四元三一二五、申滙現貨廿三元、爲三百十六元、日匯現貨亦鬆半元、爲一百〇三元半、九時四十分申匯現貨續升四元、爲三百二十元、十時四十分申匯現貨再升四元、爲三百二十四元、十時五十分美匯現貨回緊〇六二五、爲二十四元二五、十一時三十分平穩無榮辱、半日申匯現貨比升十一元、下午週六無市、</p>

<h3>大量港幣收黃金　高峯已見四千二百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、每日髙騰、以前晚傳港電匯款購金確實數目、聞有一百萬元港幣之多、而外匯趨勢續緊、故人氣蓬勃、一開即橫跳一百〇五元爲四千一百五十元、後以獲利多戶如銀樓帮金號等均限價四千一百元以上賣出、致二度退達四千一百十元、但未幾錢兌業證券帮及某金號人市猛吸、據謂大都受港帮之託、時價再升至四千一百七十元、惟此後向代港帮搜買之某錢兌業突來喊賣、一時引起散戶跟風吐出、遂撳小四十元、不意匯市仍軟、錢兌業某號力代客方猛扒、遂復向上、見四千二百元全日最高峰、旋以限賣者均來、證券帮銀樓帮暨散多爲今日假期關係、紛紛賣出頗多、但給予港帮搜羅良機、迨收盤終小三十五元、爲四千一百六十五元、較上日又暴漲一百二十元、午後塲外趨勢仍佳、買風尙餘、價在四千一百七十元之上、半天交易仍旺、約二千餘兩、銀樓飾金結果又高十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤又漲百念元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開承上二日之餘風續挺、月隔昨所傳港電購金匯款、據其數有港幣百萬之鉅、因買方做多心思更濃、時聞匯市開後即縮、人氣立刻鬨起、喊買聲大振、多方趁機猛抬、延至九時三十分開市價竟橫跳一百〇五元之多、錢兌業售予金號二十兩、爲四千一百五十元、少頃某金號突撳價賣出、同時散戶亦限四千一百元外拋售、故一霎時即回落四十元、某金號售予證券帮十兩、爲四千一百十元、其時某錢兌業又復起來代港帮收買、遂又抬起三十元、某錢兌業進同業二十兩、爲四千一百四十元、後銀樓帮及散戶等頻來吐出、且港帮其時買風已息、遂又見回小三十元、重達四千一百十元低盤、嗣後錢兌業與金號等復代港帮搜入、同時證券帮亦有納胃、且滙市繼續報軟、故又飛漲六十元、綫兌業進金號三十兩、爲四千一百七十元、旋以向代港帮買進之某錢兌業、突來喊賣、其數約二百兩光景、故一時散戶頓跟風賣出、立回小四十元、錢兌業吐予令號二十兩、爲四千一百三十元、十一時半後、另一錢兌業突代本地帮猛進、加以匯市趨勢頗緊、一時售者絕跡、故漲度甚速、不久即飛躣七十元、錢兌業進銀樓帮十兩、爲四千二百元、時四千二百元限價賣戶湧旺、漲風頓挫、後證券帮某銀樓及散多等競吐、時港帮則乘機扳價吸納、未幾即回落三十五元、證券帮賣予錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百六十五元作午收價、收後一度續降至四千一百五十元、但不久又復髙至四千一百六十五元、午後週六停市、結果照午收比上日又猛漲一百二十元、查已速升三天、共計二百九十九元、半天九十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤高十元、收進减低二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛四百廿元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十元、迫至九時四十分掛大十元、十一時三刻續髙五元、正午回落五元、此後未有續變、結果大同行改縣四百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减小十五元至二十元不等、</p>
<h3>外幣上漲益烈　美金票到十三元八五</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊、需要愈暢、市價更昂英美金票、客戶傾納旺盛、市價激烈上騰、美金票升達十三元八角五分、近午市况稍鬆、晚市爲十三元六角七分、香港票法郞票供給稀少、市價堅挺、日金票需要稍盛、市價微昂、晚市爲一元二角五分、朝鮮票稍軟弱、晚市爲一元一角三分七厘、昨日市價、英金鎊升二元五角、英金票升二元二角、美金鎊升三元、美金票升五角二分、香港票升七分、法郞票升三厘、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>證劵　外股多空軋平　內債買方占優勢</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况仍係疲軟之象、甲丙種埃打破七元、戊種亦退入八元內、大概受烚赤突又在漲之影響、多日來行市漲固不易、跌亦甚難、多方勢力尙稱雄厚、以最近之趨勢下之、空方或將吃前虧、昨日上午交易、二十號三十五號貿大及源裕買進、永康聯和潤利以及永大聯益賣出、午後永康聯和潤利繼續賣出、泰豐大通昌記以及鴻大均有買進、觀此買賣陣綫、多者自多、空者目空、大都爲一貫主旨、市價結果、小一角至三角、成交數約計七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交慶豐紗廠股二十五股、價爲七元正、</p>
<p>昨日衆萊公所股巿、浮多最後五分鐘之了結、與外匯之步趨緊佾、致各股又現低價、而造成多空軋平後之巨大成交額、收盤時在相當水凖之價格下、不鮮買戶活動、橡皮股亦受小量浮多了結影響而軟、但所受打擊、顯不逮實業股之甚、</p>
<p>倫敦一日電　今日中國外偵緝牌行市、仍吿平穩、上下檔各公價、均無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦一日、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛脾行市、大體均吿平靜、僅古拉客林傍橡皮股重升十一便士、爲二十一先令六便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　中外棉巿　大漲特漲</h3>
<p>通花抬至一百六十元　日廠訂購美棉萬餘包</p>
<p>本棉交易、較前爲少、然市價之漲風奇熾、此因海外美印棉市之漲風再接再厲、而同時滙票在縮、以致明暗齊漲、於是人心堅挺萬丈、市塲一般手中執貨之戶、鑒於前者狀况、皆喊無貨物可供給、大家都閉門謝絕、不開樣單、因之成交减少、均成有行無市、此種情形、大有棉荒模樣、市上之呌價紊亂、上午做開通花價由一百五十八元至一百六十二元、比上日猛昂七八元之譜、午後出髙價不能得貨、如斯狀態、未免恐懼過甚也、蘇北來源、到通花二千三百十八包、北沙來一千八百八十包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>白包火機一五〇·〇〇同行進　一六〇包</p>
<p>白包火機一五三·〇〇同行進　二〇〇包</p>
<p>白包火機一五一·〇〇同行進　一五〇包</p>
<p>白包火機一五二·〇〇同行進　一六〇包</p>

<p>美種花　一六七·〇〇同行進　二四〇包</p>
<p>美種花　一六五·〇〇同行進　一六〇包</p>
<p>美種花　一六九·〇〇同行進　二〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來漲風殊　、連漲已將旬日、昨晨開盤又因投機者之購買、及海外需要之增多、現貨交易、殊爲旺盛、利物浦孟買來電、俱吿良好、因之人心異常興奮、空頭抵補者極爲踴躍、結果收盤價格較之上日又漲十餘磅音、印度連同預測漲三羅比、埃及漲四十餘磅音、利物沛漲十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、華廠方面因滙兌驟緊、交易因而轉靜、然日廠方面却轉形活躍、彼等均以美棉漲勢甚烈、有達一角一二分之可能、故日來大事搜購、昨日又有萬餘包成交、美滙　所以猛縮、花款結價大有關係也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙七元二五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　二〇三、五〇</p>
<p>又又　下級一九八、九〇</p>
<p>三十二支　一二〇、八五</p>
<p>又又　下級二〇四、四〇</p>
<p>四十二支　三四、五〇</p>
<p>又又　下級二〇六、二五</p>
<h3>紗價疾升　雙馬又到七百元</h3>
<p>紗市轉堅、漲風劇烈、此因海外歐美棉市續趨前進、大有漲無止境之象、同時日紗有輸送出口裝運印度等消息、於是本紗亦被牽動、而廠方成本日見增髙、所以投機買風又見熾烈、至於實銷一層亦不像昔日之呆滯矣、港帮零星採辦、較爲活絡、二十支雙馬紗髙峯一度曾至七百元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開同業聚議、口齒驟緊、因印棉漲風殊堪驚人、買者叢集、形勢允挺、開價一跳十三元、二十支變馬價爲六百九十元、少頃聞外滙又縮、人心重振、市價徐徐上升、再緊一步、漲至七百元、但廣帮吃胃未强、又疲落五元、査半日間成交二千四百包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十元、雙地球漲二十九元、天女漲二十四元、今日有棉紗三百九十五件運港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>午後消息、紗價再漲殊巨、均係囤戶收藏、申新二廠開出二十支天女數百包、價爲七百元外、三月期、</p>
<h3>疋頭　殷富囤布　巿盤扶搖直上</h3>
<p>棉布因匯市冉緊、漲風大熾、同業及業外殷富者奮力買進、售盤扶搖直上、白貨細布·細斜等每疋漲二角半至七角半、漂染布每疋漲五角至一元、綫呢嗶嘰每碼漲二三分、重磅絨布、因時令關係、價尙平定、本街成交各貨在千件以上、甬帮辦十六磅粗布百餘包、粵港帮辦粗斜·細布·細斜·印花絨一百餘件、南洋帮添辦印花·色丁·色布·漂布等貨一萬餘疋</p>
<p>東布漲風續厲、氣勢甚盛、蓋以本街同業及投機囤戶在拖濫進、白貨細布細斜每疋在跳一元左右、十二磅龍頭細布晨開廿元〇五角、逐步上騰、至後市開盤最高峰現貨售開廿一元一角、本月份期貨自廿一元二角半起、做到二十一元五角、中途現貨回降至二十元〇七角、收盤復昂、爲二十元〇九角、全日成交各牌細布細斜現貨一千餘件、期貨在一千五百件以上、行方拋售期貨細布約一千件之譜、伊藤開出最多、東棉牧淮龍頭等牌細布四五百件、龍頭現貨結價二十一元、故市勢極挺、四君子嗶嘰漲至六角九分、收市時爲六角八分、</p>
<h3>煤炭　開平煤價提高</h3>
<p>開平烟煤、前因貨少、本街需要爽健、致市貨被搜一空、最近新貨雖絡繹有到、日昨曼麗馬勒輪又裝來開平統煤五千六百噸、但本街及客帮在辦、大有隨到隨銷之勢、加之新近水脚加大、市盤亦見抬髙、計做開平一號塊每噸八十六元、二號塊七十三元、華水屑七十三元、二號屑六十四元、較上月均加上兩三元行情、以上均同業拆價、送到客家、尙須零加行摃、</p>
<h3>糖巿　洋糖回升</h3>

<h3>巿况彙誌</h3>
<p>生粉港銷活躍　港帮採辦飛麒麟及KG嘜數千包、而市存不及萬包、昨已開升三元、計飛麒麟標一千包、價爲四十元、　抽芯珍眉突活　滯銷月餘之抽芯珍眉綠茶、由保昌永大錦隆協和各行、購進三十餘字、總額一千六百餘箱、抽珍售價自二百八十元至三百四十五元、統珍自二百元至二百五十元、珠茶三百十二元、貢熙一百五十四元、行情珠茶激漲二三十元、其餘亦提十餘元、</p>
<p>本釘開價仍軟　本元釘近因廠家出產未减、大有供過於求之勢、昨建藥帮辦去百桶、此外零星、開價每桶倍司四十四元、但四十二三元開出不少、</p>

<h3>滬西成罪惡淵藪　又發生可怖命案　曹家渡有血淋淋之人頭　屍體亦經查獲聽候檢驗</h3>
<p>滬西越界築路區域、自日偽侵犯捕房警權以後、歹徒乘機蠭起、秩序日見紊亂、成爲「歹土」、允以曹家波一帶白晝搶刦等案、時有所聞、入夜七時、商店即行打烊、十時行人絕跡、景象凄凉、前晚十一時許、曹家渡五角塲突發現血淋淋男子頭顱一顆、情狀異常可怖、滬西治安之壞、歹徒之目無法紀、於此可見、茲詳紀各情如次、</p>
<p>人頭一顆情狀可怖</p>
<p>前晚（一日）十一時二十五分許、滬西曹家渡五角塲正興館麵店門前、突發現人頭一具、髮作平頂、面色慘白、鼻孔中鮮血直流、口中並鑲金牙一隻、雙眼緊閉、其傍亞有似圍巾之布一條、血跡斑然、其狀慘極、見之令人心悸、一時覜者如堵、傳說紛紛、</p>
<p>捕房偵查發現屍體</p>
<p>靜安寺捕房得報後、立派警備車及鐵甲車多輛、到塲查察、因祗見屍首、不見屍體、甚爲奇訝、當派探捕四處勘察、於該處富生公司賭窟弄內之牆角上、發現紙條一張、上書「張之洞、年三十四歲、鎭江人、」等語、探捕認爲該字條與案有關、當即帶回捕房偵查、一而召救護車將該屍首送入騐屍所、</p>
<p>分贓不勻引起嫌隙</p>
<p>據華聞社記者調查所知、該屍首之名為王之洞、綽號「小王」、係綽號「臭魚頭」夏錫江之徒弟、為當地之土痞、平日專以敲詐竊盜爲生、因分贓不勻、小王遂與同黨反目、最近爲某捕房探員之眠綫探悉、故將其同黨一一捕捉、於是若輩疑「小王」爲之引錢、遂欲置「小王」於死地而後甘心、</p>
<p>大批兇犯竟下毒手</p>
<p>前晚十一時許「小王」適在勞勃生路浴身池浴室中洗浴、若輩聞悉、即糾集大批兇徒、携帶武器、至該浴室中强逼出外、小王見勢不佳、不敢與抗、當被若輩挾往三角塲信昌絲廠後面永成缸甏店附近之空地上、用盒子砲連開十二三槍、將共擊斃後、即以利器將其支解三段、將身軀拋入蘇州河內、將首級帶往五角塲、棄於地上、彼等即一哄而散、刻捕房正在派探偵查中、</p>
<p>汽車疾馳擲出人頭</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、昨（一日）夜十一時、有汽車一輛、循白利南路疾駛、車中突擲出蔴袋、內盛鮮血淋漓之首級一顆、墮地滾出、路人見之、頗爲驚駭、旋經警員搜索結果、在極司非爾路旁、距白利南路五角塲不遠之義塚附近、發現首級被斫去之屍體一具、死者究係何人、尙未查明、</p>
<p>槍洞二處為致命傷</p>
<p>頭顱有槍彈洞二處、爲其致死原因、屍體附近、並發現彈殼二顆、該被殺華人、年的三旬、鑲有金牙兩枚、屍體穿呢大衣、據目覩者談、拋出首級之車中、坐三四人、至於共人在何地被殺、尙未發現證跡、大約殺害地與棄屍地相距非近、此爲上海歹土之最近罪案、殺害之原因、或係暴徒間之報仇、公共租界警員與大道警察均在偵查此事中、</p>
<h3>煤斤充足　最近運抵十二萬噸　値國幣五百萬餘元</h3>

<p>名留願意職以待機緣</p>
<p>大使繼稱、僑華英人仍能以留守其職務、爲對國家盡最佳之服務、戰爭爆發後未幾、余曾發廣播演說、忠吿英人勿忽返本國、或遽欲入壕參戰、但保守其原職、靜待國家需要彼等之服務時、乃奮身而起、今無理由追述余前此所言、自彼時起所發生之種種事件、已證實余前此所言之確當、</p>
<p>英國需要航空人員</p>
<p>自該次播音後、已接英政府致駐華各領署之訓示、令各領署錄下與航空有關各英僑之名單、至此、大使宣讀訓令全文、內囑英領署辦公處對當地英僑具有適常資格、可充飛機駕駛員與無錢電員等者、錄下詳情與姓名、大使續稱、在座諸君、大半已知此項訓令、自諸君之表情覜之、已知諸君多半自認有申請投効之資格、除此以外、余不能續述他事、頗爲抱歉、</p>

<h3>英駐軍東旭萊隊　調赴華北填防　西福資隊業已到滬填防　此次換防純係常例瓜代</h3>
<p>上月十三日、英國陸軍部宣稱、英政府已決定撤退華北英國駐軍、僅留若干必要部隊、用以保護英國人民之安全與資產、昨據天津消息、駐津英軍實漢輕步隊一中隊、定四日晚乘火車赴秦皇島、候期乘怡和公司嘉生輪微發、惟開船日期及目的地點、未經宜佈，</p>
<p>津駐軍調港滬英軍赴津</p>
<p>據悉、津英軍當調至香港、而此舉爲寳漢隊整營撤退之第一步、津英軍撤退後、前傳當調滬英軍之一部前往接防、昨日亦經可恃方面證實、</p>
<p>上海英防軍增補百餘名</p>
<p>惟此舉並非作事實上之减少上海英國防軍、因此閒英軍東旭萊隊一中隊、雖已於昨日乘德生輪遄返華北、的於五日晚到達、以瓜代開拔之竇漢隊、惟德生輪一日由港抵滬時、曾載來英軍西福資高地隊一百二十名、到滬塡防、據英軍當局方而消息、此間之調防、純爲規定之手續、縱歐戰不發生、每屆常例瓜代之期、亦須有調動也、</p>
<p>駐滬法防軍增援隊調回</p>
<p>前次英國宣布撤退天津駐軍時、法國亦繼之有同樣之表示、昨據津訊、英竇漢隊撤退後、津法軍不日亦將撤退赴安南、至上海法國守備軍、上月二十五日已撤離一隊、的八百人遄赴安南、此間法國駐軍、遂恢復前年「八一三一前狀况、按、彼時法國駐軍、共的千二百人、包括步兵砲兵及坦克車隊、名爲「混合大隊」滬戰驟發、法國抽調安南各營士兵、混合組成兩大隊、派至上海法和界增防、名爲「中國派遣隊」、及至去年、常駐守備隊曁增援隊之返國士兵、已見逐漸减少、最近常駐之一混合大隊」、並經抽調增援之「中國派遣隊」士兵加以捕充、於是增防之兩隊、名額亦愈見减少、此次開赴安南者、悉屬增防之軍隊、換言之、即將增防軍全數調回、而恢復八一三前駐軍狀况、</p>

<p>營業情形</p>
<p>該廠規模甚大、在天津南京靑島香港厦門均設有分廠、其原料一部份採自福建東三省及自本國運來者、營業素稱發達、但目「八一三」戰事爆發後、除上海香港外、其他分廠、均已停閉、其在上海總廠之製作品、大都爲香港烟箱蛋箱及建築物所需用之材料等、</p>

<h3>中央銀行函請商會　制止儲積輔幣券　角票兌換以五十元為度　可與發行新分幣券啣接</h3>

<p>蘇農浙地角幣兌竣</p>
<p>滬市目角幣恐慌後、一般負有調劑經濟責任者、咸多方設法、故中農蘇農浙地等銀行、均將庫存一角·二角·二角五分·及五角角幣、儘量兌換、俾資流通市面、减少平民及小本經紀者之痛苦、獲益匪淺、自實行以來、各公司行號前往各該行兌換者、自晨至暮、踵趾相接、迄至前日、蘇農浙地等行、已將庫存角幣、完全兌出、</p>
<p>中農兌換重加限制</p>
<p>中農則照常假亞爾培路中央銀行兌換，惟以蘇農浙地兩行停止兌換後、全市目標、羣集於中農一處故兌換者更形擁擠、茲聞該行以兌換漫無限制、則仍有囤積居奇之現象、故於昨日起、重行規定、凡前往兌換角幣者、以五十元爲限、蓋非如此不足以普遍流行市面也、聞日期則以兌完爲止、大的能啣接八日中央鋃行所發行之新分幣券、嗣後市上當不致再有恐慌之現象矣、</p>

<p>國力與道德之關係</p>
<p>謂國家之力量須視其是吾能承認其自身之過失以爲斷、而國家之光榮亦端賴其是否能負起建設新世界之責任而定、是故吾人不僅需要一種上帝啟示之政治道德、且須日常在各地各時受上帝之管理、吾人須敎訓自己依誠實·純潔·無私·博愛·之原則而生活、在個人與公共生活上使上帝旨意得有所滿足、重整道德即爲此種生活之基礎、吾人自不得不投效之、</p>

<h3>重整　道德運動在中國　（上）</h3>
<p>自從重整道德運動在歐洲發祥以來，雖爲時不過一載有餘，然而它鮮明燦爛的光輝，已經普照於地球上每個角落了，影響所及，不但是國家元首，學者，大衆，就是半開化的南非土人，也深蒙其惠。各國朝野人士，莫不同聲稱道，交相讚譽，紛紛加入這負有時代使命的新運動，大衆站在重整道德運動的旗幟下，抱着滿腔的熱望，整齊步伐，朝着目標，奮勇邁進。</p>
<p>我國最高領袖蔣總裁曁夫人蔣宋美齡女士，對於重整道德運動，贊助尤力，年來對此所發言論，旣引起全世界人仕的熱烈歡迎與注意了。在第一二届世界大會時，均專電致意，承認這種運動，爲目今混沌腐敗的局面，一劑對症下藥的良方。那就是澈底剷除貪婪，自私，懦怯，仇恨的根源。這是解決世界上任何罪惡的初步辦法。</p>
<p>何謂重整道德運動？它的任務是什麼？原來重整道德運動是給予個人一種切實的綱領—誠心，正意，修身，齊家，治國，平天下。它是沒有黨派種族與階級的畛域，由一般觸悟的同志聯成一氣，在日常生活中遵守四大規律—誠實，無私，純潔，博愛。改善個人，改造國家，創立新世界。</p>
<p>我國響應重整道德運動，遠在他國之前，推究厥因，良以重整道德運動，切合我國需要，民爲邦本，本固邦髯，値此危急存亡之秋，洗心革面，重整道德運動，實爲救亡圖存之唯一要圖。</p>
<p>重整道德運動分佈我國東西南北各部，其活動範圍爲整個社會全體，如大中學校，敎會，公團，政府職員，商人等，均先後加人運動。</p>
<p>最近上海報章刋載財部發表消息，華西某女士，因受重整道德運動的影響將走漏的關稅一宗，按額償還國民政府。</p>

<h3>環境的忍耐</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>不久前，會經有過幾天突來的酷冷，許多小朋友早晨躲在被窩裏不肯起身，經母親三四次的催促，方才勉強落下床來盥洗，身上添穿了禦寒的衣服，絨線衫啦，衛生褲啦，呢大衣啦，可還是喊冷不止。簡直不願冒着寒冷去學校上課。抄書，記日記這些課外作業都停止，原因是兩手冷得怕執筆。</p>
<p>這裏我要講一個外國偉人納爾遜的幼年故事給怕冷的小朋友們聽。那是個風雪交作的嚴寒天，納爾遜在去學校的途中，因為不願忍受雪打風吹，又想念到家裏燒火的溫煖，便中途折回，不料到家後被家長大大的教訓一頓，他只得硬起頭皮再去學校，反覺勇氣陡增，由此養成不畏艱險，忍受苦難環境的習慣，而終於成為偉人。</p>
<p>小朋友們不是時常希望將來自己能做偉人嗎？可是偉人不是袖手而成的，先決條件，須得忍受一切苦難，能忍受苦難，便是能打破環境的約束，然後才能建立大事業，做大人物。為什麼你們連一些冷都忍耐不住呢！在中國也有映雪讀書的故事，大家知道下雪天格外冷，那位窮讀書人家無油燈，尚能映雪夜讀，小朋友安坐電燈光下，還能妄嫌天冷，畏縮偷懶嗎！</p>
<p>何不看看馬路上的黃包車夫，學校中的校役，牛奶公司送牛奶的人…呢？他們一年四季，無論風霜雨雪，何論炎熱酷冷，他們絕不間斷其服務工作，為着要吃飯。再看看你們的父母，除掉假日，那天不要奔忙操勞，任憑天氣冷得怎樣，仍要凍紅鼻子上公事房，為什麼？因為要掙錢扶養你們，供書上學。豈能畏冷偷懶！</p>
<p>一比較，小朋友們是幸福得多了。不用愁衣愁食，沒有生活負担，儘可一志向學，認眞讀書。寒冷僅屬一些小小的環境阻難，自然極應加以忍耐。</p>
<h3>太值錢—不敢吃</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>在民國二十年的時候，漢口有個女小孩，年紀尙未滿十歲，名呌易傳富。伊的哥哥是在政界中做事的。有一天，買了一隻文旦回來給伊吃，伊不要吃；剝了皮後再給伊吃，伊也不要吃。「這是什麼意思？」哥哥問，伊慢吞吞地答：「這文旦是哥哥化了重價去買來的，像這樣太值錢的東西，我不敢吃。」（錄自兒童雜誌）</p>
<p>現在文旦不是又上市了嗎。價錢比起往年來，要貴起一倍多。小朋友們！當你們的家長買回來給你們吃時，可會發生與伊同樣的感想？</p>
<p>今日孤島上的物價，可以八個字來形容。「有貨皆貴，無物不漲。」小朋友！你們大概亦都明瞭的，那麼，對於一切，不拘是吃的，用的，玩的，都要做到「節省」二字，而尤其是太值錢的東西，應該摒槳它的慾望為是。照這樣，一方面，體諒了你們的家長；一方面你們自己也養成了節儉的美德，「大好男兒」當之無愧。</p>
<p>近來，天氣一天天的冷了，各界都在呼籲擴大募捐難民寒衣的運動。小朋友！你們是社會的一份子，也應該負起一部份責任來。最低的限度，須向你們的家屬親友間去勸導來響應這個運動：此外，即節省你們平日的費用，不吃太值錢的東西。能夠這樣，你們的責任就已盡了。</p>
<p>太值錢—不敢吃。我希望你們能做到，太值錢—不要吃。在另一面，假使能使你們的家長，做到，太值錢—不要買；那麼，是更其完滿了。</p>
<h3>喜事—明兒避難記之四十五—</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>一幕一幕村子裏新年的點綴品在明兒的眼膜上映過得很明晰。一霎眼又是元宵佳節，村子裏同樣也有這上燈的風俗。在那天傍晚，大多數的人家都點上了各式各樣的紙燈，但都是簡單得如狀元燈之類，大門前，房屋裏，天井中，一盞盞的高懸着。從小弄外望去，每一家的燈無形中成了一串，倒也相當的可觀，似乎是開了個燈會。明兒家當然是無興來慶祝這個佳節，黑暗暗的仍點上了霎眼的油盞火。那房東太太眞是待他們太好了，還遺了幾個丫環來，把燈懸在他們屋子的天井裏—明兒的家，頓時的亮了不少，總算有一些點綴點綴，不曾虛度佳節。伊更轉言邀他們到祠堂裏去瞧人家的喜事。這種房東太太是少有的了。</p>
<p>喜事，尤其是這村子裏的喜事，外鄉來的異客那一個不想觀光觀光，廣廣眼界？而那好奇的明兒格外的高興，當然不肯錯過這個千載難逢的好機會。</p>
<p>大批的村裏人似乎在軍隊中聽得集中號般聚集起來，而祠堂裏的喜事的確吸引了這一羣人，鬧烘烘的，把寂靜的祠堂頓時變成了塵囂的禮堂。</p>
<p>假座在祠堂裏做喜事，在明兒心目中是感覺得異常的新奇，不錯，這是村裏特殊的風俗，因為在那裏沒有一家菜館，而居屋又是這樣的狹小，簡直連四五桌酒菜也容納不下，那麼唯有把這寬大的祠堂充作禮堂了。</p>
<p>那天是有一家人家出嫁女兒到附近的另一個村子裏。祠堂裏也早已佈置得楚楚可觀了，但是簡單得再也不能簡單了。正中的石檯上，一雙粗大的喜燭高高的插在石製的燭座上，那火燄照耀得滿堂可以算很明亮了。（因為平時明兒的眼睛被油盞火照慣了，一旦遇到了燭光，宛然是在汽油燈光下。其實那兩支燭光也有限得很，況且又是在這廣大的祠堂裏。）有不少的戴紅花的男人在整理着紅帖子，那是送給外客的。</p>
<p>祠堂外一陣喧譁聲，原來那邊村裏來迎娶的花轎已進入了這個村子，喇叭聲，銅鑼聲，呼喊聲，皮皷聲，一陣夾一陣的傳遞過來，而注入了佇望在祠堂外的每一個人的耳殼裏。</p>
<p>儀仗隊浩浩蕩蕩的，排着不整齊的隊伍越發接近那祠堂，夾雜的聲音也相當的響亮。一排鞭砲聲演過後，那很富麗的花轎便進入了祠堂的大門。那吹喇叭的是村裏壯丁訓練的號手，吹奏的不知道是軍樂呢？還是婚樂？好有趣！</p>
<p>一大羣的人圍着花轎看個明白。隔了整整的有一個鐘頭之久，那裝扮得大紅大綠和廟裏菩薩一般的新娘才姍姍而來。除了那新娘的身材矮小得和小孩子差不多，可以瞧見之外，其他卻一無所見，伊的面貌被那條可厭的繡帕遮蔽沒不通風。在異常紛擾之中，那新娘走入了花轎。儀仗隊才散漫的踏上了原路到男家去了。</p>
<p>後來明兒才知道那新娘祇有一十三歲便出嫁了。怪不得伊是這樣的矮小。村子裏原也盛行早婚的風俗。我國的被稱為「東亞病夫」，這早婚的壞風俗也要負起一大部的責任。</p>
<h3>徵募難童寒衣運動</h3>
<p>— 盧啟照</p>
<p>現在是冬天的時候了，塞風猛烈的吹着，上海有無數被難的同胞，沒有寒衣穿，正在靠着我們去救濟。鄙人現有一個小小意見，舉列於下：凡大的同胞，去救濟被難的大同胞，凡我小同胞，去救濟被難的小同胞。鄙人是小同胞之一，應負起救濟被難小同胞的責任。</p>
<p>現在有中華慈幼協會。徵募難童寒衣一萬件，凡我小同胞們，有破舊的衣裳，褲，等：或國幣二角，三角，四角，五角，………等者都可送到中華慈幼協會去，地址愛多亞路中匯大樓二〇八號，救濟我們小同胞，不會使他受到寒風的摧殘。況現國難時期，小同胞是我們中華民國未來的柱石，我們應當去培植他，救濟他，這是功德無量的呀！</p>
<h3>藍矮子　（十一）</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>阿麗處在這玲瓏小巧的環境裏，頓時覺得自己是多麼的笨重與過大了。譬如伊的一雙腳，像伊這樣的年紀，很為相配，並不太大，但伊要是一隻腳踏上那小屋的窗子，一定要把窗裏的東西全都踢翻了。</p>
<p>阿麗向四下裏呆看了一會，心中暗暗自語道：一呀，我料不到自己會這樣的大而無當的！瞧我自已倒好像變了一個呆笨的種田漢；那得把我的身子縮小起來，也像他們一模一樣呢？」</p>
<p>旁邊忽有一個聲音發出來道：「是啊，有種種的不方便！」阿麗即忙低下頭去，瞧是誰在那裏說話原來就是先前最初和伊接談的那個矮人。伊有些窘了，心想我心中所想的，並沒有說出口來，怎麼會被他知道的。於是開口說道：「不論甚麼事情，一方面有方便的，一方面也有不方便的。譬如你們住在這裏很合適，但是一到我們的世界裏，不是覺得身體太矮小了麼？」那矮人點點頭道：「不錯，不錯，事情確是有方便有不方便的。」</p>
<p>阿麗見他並不駁回自已的話，暗想矮人的脾氣倒也怪好的。於是起了個主意，想尋出他們一些短處來，批評一下，當下慢吞吞地說道：「你們的村子果然很小巧，很美麗，但是—你們得恕我，我並不是有意失禮—」那矮人忙道：「不，你不會失禮，因為伯母曾對你說過，對於我們要有禮貌的。」阿麗詫異道：「誰的伯母？伊可不是你們的伯母啊！」那矮人悄然答道：「不管是你的或我的伯母，總之伯母的話是不錯的。」阿麗聽了這種自大的口氣，很不高興，恨不得頓着腳罵他一下，但是想到了伯母的話，總覺不敢違拗，只索把一腔怒氣咽了下去，不再發作了。</p>
<p>伊停了一下，就悄悄地說道：「我所要說的話，不過表示我的一些意見，也不能說是有失禮貌的。據我的眼光看來，你們的村子裏的一切，果然是又小又美，但是缺少變化，未免單調一些，要是變化多些，那就更美了。你瞧自已，村干裏的許多屋子，不是完全一模一樣，毫無變化的嗎？還有你們村子裏的人，和你們那些穿着棕色衣服的妻子，不也是一模一樣，沒有變化的嗎？且慢，我還要請問你們，你們有沒有小孩子呢？」矮人急道：「當然有的，並且多得很哩。」阿麗問道：「如此小孩子又在那裏？難道他們都已睡了不成？」說時，帶着譏諷的口氣，以為這時剛剛入夜，孩子們決不會這樣早就安睡的。」誰知那矮人卻泰然答道：「是啊，都已睡了，這當兒多分已在做夢呢。你總也知道，小孩子都是喜歡做夢的。」說到這裏，抬頭瞧着阿麗，臉上做出一種很奇怪的神氣，就是他的聲音，也很奇怪。阿麗心中也起了一種奇怪的感覺，暗想他的話倒像是針對着自己說的。自已不也是一個小孩子嗎？不要也是在做夢嗎？</p>

<h3>理想成事實　九演追韓信　文武老生大會串中演出</h3>
<p>— 睢我</p>
<p>三個月以前我曾經在本刋建議賑務當局，願他們能根據我的意見，舉行一次「麒派大會串」。上月難民救濟會預備演唱義務戲，對於我的建議，頗有接受的可能，不過麒麟童自已，爲避免門戶之見，不願意用「麒派大會串」這個名詞，經過幾慶磋商的結果，現在理想終成事實，救濟會當局，已定於本月七日，假座天蟾舞臺，公演這堂好戲，雖然易名爲「文武老生大會串」，然而實際上還是脫胎於一麒派大會串」，戲碼排定如左：</p>

<p>梁次山（樵夫）</p>
<p>上面的戲碼大致與我以前所擬的相同，鴻門宴劇中角色的分派，完全根據我的意思，麒老脾破天荒改飾范增，必有驚人演出。大軸之追韓信，集文武老生於一爐，可謂空前創舉，聞麒老牌只演後段之登臺拜帥，趙老開演跑圓塲之一塲，三金殿換三個蕭何。六飾韓信，四飾劉邦，四飾夏侯嬰，無不別開生面，只此一戲，已可轟動一時矣。</p>

<h3>古塔盜寶記（新片介紹）　“Sherlock　Holmes”</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>「古塔盜寳記」和古堡魅影」絕對不同的地方是：前者的摩爾泰出塲，就使觀衆留着他是本案兇犯的印象，後者則吾，直到結束時才證明誰是兇犯。所以「古塔盜寳記」的演出效果是不及「古堡魅影」的緊張激盪。</p>
<p>「古塔盜寳記」是把兩件案子同時交互發展着的，因爲兇犯出塲在先，所以導演威格在摩爾泰敎授送出恐嚇信後，就把他略去，使留觀的注意力跟着白蘭登的不安，而集中在勞合的暗殺案上。這一點果然是彌補了劇本上的缺陷，但是我以爲開塲摩爾泰在法庭上被宣判無罪一節，也不妨刪去，而後從福爾摩斯接受古塔御宮珠寳管理人唐納爵士及白蘭登的委託，使兩件案子交互地發展下去，那末勞合被殺及福爾摩斯謀殺勞合兇手的口中得知摩爾泰的陰謀，而趕到古塔去破案這兩個高潮將見力量。</p>
<p>這兩個髙潮的處理，導演在氣氛上的把握是成功的。勞合被殺時。福爾摩斯馬車的疾馳；勞合和韓特的行動秘密；慘呌之後，幾個警察，馬夫等的特寫短鏡頭，使這塲戲非常緊凑有力。後一塲摩爾泰和福爾摩斯的追遂，也同樣緊張。導演者的運用倫敦大霧和强烈的光錢，是更加强偵探片的窒息空氣。</p>
<p>其他如勾劃福爾摩期和華生的性格，也見可愛</p>
<p>貝錫爾賴斯朋的福爾摩斯，他能遝用凝視的眼珠，使這人物突出是成功的。</p>

<h3>從蘇芬談判到蘇芬衝突</h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>目前歐戰形勢的演進，並不在於戰塲上的搏鬥，却是在於國際外交，經濟，宣傳上的劇烈鬥爭，尤其是在外將舞台上的劇戰，大家都勾心鬥角，運巴縱橫的手腕，　固自己的勢力在小到半個月裏面，蘇聯先　與愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞和立陶宛簽訂了互助協定，使波　的海單位組成一道　固的外圍綫，然後邀芬蘭代表至莫斯科舉行談話，不料陷於僵的之中，兩國關係頓呈緊張，以至於戰爭何以此次談判遺受挫折，其廠結何在？我們在這裏有加以檢討的必要。</p>
<p>在未討論本文以前，對於蘇芬兩國過去的關係，應先加說明：</p>
<p>蘇芬過去關係</p>
<p>芬蘭位終歐洲北部，居波羅的海的東岸，爲北歐四中立國之一，芬蘭舊屬瑞典版圖，歷七百年，一八〇八年被舊俄征服，一九一七年俄國革命，它就於十二月初宣告獨立，一九一八年一月間蘇聯政府承認芬蘭獨立，一九一九年七月，芬蘭境內共產勢力囂張，引起了芬蘭國內有力的反共產運；　萊本黨Lapuans　領導，一九三〇年七月間準備賡　談判。蘇芬談判何以一波一疊，癥結在漢科問題。漢科是芬蘭灣口的一個商埠，離芬京赫爾新基僅六十里，蘇聯要求在漢科設海軍根據地，如此不但可控制了芬蘭灣，而且也可控制了整個的波羅的海，而芬蘭因爲漢科是芬蘭灣——也是芬蘭立國的咽喉，絕對不允割讓，致使談判陷於僵局中。漢科不　與芬蘭有密切的關係，同時與瑞典也有很大的關係，原來漢科距瑞京斯德哥爾莫僅百餘里，蘇聯如在該處駐兵，小營控制瑞京，若蘇聯進一步佔有亞蘭羣島，則瑞典大受威脅，故瑞典異常關心芬蘭的前途。</p>
<p>自談判陷於僵局後，蘇聯在報章上便猛烈抨擊芬蘭，同時萊本黨强迫農民黨內閣辭職，國會也旋吿解散。但萊本黨的活動更爲猖獗，便引起了全國人民的憤怒，於是萊本黨的活動就暫時消沉一下不過，到了一九三二年二月間，有四千來本黨徒在曼晚薩拉地方動員，企圖進佔赫爾新基Helsinki，赫爾新基的陸軍和防軍都效忠政府，所以不到　天，萊本黨的叛變就吿敉平，而且沒有流一點血。同年芬蘭和蘇聯締結友好條約。再自從蘇聯加入國聯，為了和平而大聲疾呼以後，芬蘭的國民對於蘇聯更引起好感。但是自從李維諾夫辭職後，蘇聯的政策發生了轉變，突與德國瓜分波蘭，進而將愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞，和立陶宛置於被保護之下，立刻引起了芬蘭的强烈反感。</p>
<p>蘇芬談判　結所在</p>
<p>然蘇芬談判自十月十一日開始迄今，將近二月，其單位經過頗為曲折艱險，當時蘇聯方面態度相當堅決，且談判之始，早已胸有成竹，而芬蘭則爲保持獨立國應啊的自由平等，不願作過分的退讓，故兩國的見解距離頗遠，致使談判陷於僵局中，最近則終於發生戰爭，引起全世界人十的注意。</p>
<h3>南寗剪影</h3>
<p>— 公懹</p>
<p>日軍自從在湘北會戰中遭遇空前慘敗後，在苦悶焦燥的情緒中，思發動新的進攻，以挽回其軍事頹勢，最近的在北海·龍門·企沙一帶，强行登陸，就是想以截斷桂·越間的公路並佔據南寗的戰果來挽回湘北潰敗的聲譽。</p>
<p>沿革和地位</p>
<p>南寗，又名邕寗，爲廣西的省會，在漢時屬於鬱林郡，晋置晋興縣，爲晋興郡治。隋開皇時，改爲宣化縣，屬緣州，大業初屬鬱林郡。唐宋以後，均爲州郡治，明淸爲南寗府治，民國成立，改爲邕寗縣，普通大家仍稱它南寗。南近粵海，西鄰安南，北通黔滇，東顧潯梧，在地理上是很占重要的。城瀕鬱江北岸，係宋代皇祐年間所築，相傳當時州守夢見有神來吿：「築城如蛇狀可成。」次日，果見　蛇般繞於地，於是依其形建築，到淸乾隆四年被大水衝圯。現在的成垣，是乾隆六年所修築的，不過舊時遺跡，尙有一小部份存在。這裏在上多年前，本是僻處西南的一個普通商埠，但近幾年來，經廣西省府加速整頓的結果，南寗已成爲我國模範都市之一了。</p>
<p>壯麗的市容</p>
<p>在「建設廣西一的口號下，南寗的市容，的確是今非昔比了。從前石板砌成的街道，現在已有不少改築成　坦光滑的柏油馬路；從前古舊簡陋的住屋，也有不少翻造成華麗軒敞的新式建築。熱鬧的市街，要算南寗大馬路。德鄰路，大商號都集中在這一帶。大概南寗大馬路上，都是蘇杭洋貨的商店和金鋪；德鄰路都　土貨·五金·醬園·雜貨的商店；木行街都是火柴·洋紗·藥材的經紀行和輪船公司；鹽法街都是鹽·花生油·荳麩·桐油·牛皮的商店；打鐵街都是磁器·鐵鍋的商店。但南寗市上，熟鬧雖熱鬧却並不奢靡，一種新興的氣象，迷漫全市。商店陳列的商品，國貨多而舶來品少；在街上行走着的人，不論軍·政·學·商·都是布帽·布衣·布鞋·衣服麗都，裝束　髦的男女，眞是絕無僅有。這些都是近三年來廣西常局努力的成績，和把政治搬上了軌道的關係。</p>
<p>豐富的物產</p>
<p>因爲南寗的附近，全是沃野，草木葱鬱，所以物產非常豐富，素有「廣西倉庫」的佳譽。出產以蔗糖爲大宗，在全盛時代，每年可產千餘萬斤，現在雖已較前衰落，但尙足與洋白糖抗衡。此外，米·茴香·牛油·生絲·烟草·柑·橘·波羅蜜等，產量亦不少，每年的輸出額，平均的有二百一十萬海關兩。至於鑛產，在二塘·三塘和對河的髙嶺帶，有鑛區遼闊鑛質精良的褐煤，厚的三尺，土入掘了，運到城內來發售的頗多。伶俐灣江流灣曲處，有砂金鑛，佛砂嶺有方鉛鑛和閃鐵鑛，藏量都很富足。</p>
<p>名勝和古蹟</p>
<p>南寗的勝蹟，最著名的，有：望仙坡，髙聳城東，在宋皇祐問，武襄王狄靑和余靖，孫沔兩將，南征儂智髙時，曾在此紮營。後來邕人爲紀念他們平賊的功績，所以在坡上建了個三公祠，四季奉祀不衰，嗣又加祀蘇緘。王守仁，改名五公祠，至淸康熙年間，又加祀莽依圖，故稱六公祠。淸風樓，在馬草街的髙等法院（從前的府衙）內。宋時，爲淸風臺，圯壞已久，明嘉靖時，如府方瑜，就其遺址築淸風館，普通呌它爲淸風樓。</p>
<p>現在南寗已經暫時失陷了。但全廣西的學生軍和民團團丁，都踴躍入伍，開赴前方，實行用鐵血來保衛家鄉，一定能在白崇禧及共他將領指揮下，施展他們作戰的技術，而有把南寗收復的一天。</p>
<p>俄國的熊，是歐洲的問號。</p>
<h3>北海</h3>
<p>— 曉</p>
<p>日本軍隊先登陸的地方是北海。北海，在東京灣北，地處廉江三又港內，一八七六年，根據烟台條約開爲商埠。與海南島的海口，可用汽船相通，行程紙須十小時。港灣良好，沒有暗礁之患。陸地上有公路北迪合浦（廉州），自合浦向西北行，公路紛岐，可以與欽縣，靈山，防城相通。這是粵南交通的一　樞紐。三十多年之前，因爲有廉江，武利江，大欽江的水利，隱然成爲西江上流東散貨品的口岸。但自廣西蒼梧（梧州）以及雲南蒙自關爲商埠以後，這種有利的地位，已經消失了。</p>
<p>小董　另一個引人注意的地名是小董。小董是在勾漏山脈支脈的十萬大山以南，與邕寗（南寗）相隔一百公里有餘。照里程推算，機械化部隊的進展，好像　不需要多量時間。可是勾漏山脈眞是一個重要的屛障，三千尺以上的高嶺，不啻天塹，日軍的深入，終究有很大的艱阻。邕欽公路對於行旅來往固然稱便，而在作戰上，十萬大山無疑是優勢的防禦壁壘。</p>
<p>欽縣　欽縣巳經淪陷了。當然我們也將引爲損失。欽縣原爲欽州，是舊屬欽廉道的首鎭。在水利上，有龍門港之便，那裏正是欽江出海的咽喉。可是據可靠的測量，東京灣的水利，遠不如廣州灣。所以總理建國方略中，認爲疏濬建港，祇能列爲二等港。在陸行上，有邕欽公路直達邕寗乃是進入廣西的門戶向西南行，經防城而抵東興，則爲聯絡越南的交通綫。欽縣與東興，相距的一百五十公里。作爲我國海岸錢南端終點的北崙河，也就在那裏。欽縣在資源上最重要的是錳鑛，因爲錳是製鋼所必需，在國防上具有重大的價値。而且儲量異常豐富。不過對於日小，如果目前就想加以利用，恐怕是力所不及了。</p>
<p>邕寗　日軍以欽縣爲據點，目標是邕寗。邕寗是南部的中心，在形勢上，具有控馭的地位。東出潯（桂平）梧（蒼梧）西達龍州（鎭南關）南通欽廉，北連馬平。邕寗的奪取，日軍就妄想用以作為控制廣西的先導步驟。</p>
<p>柳州　目前對於保衛大廣西的戰略上，馬平的價値，更爲重要，馬平舊名柳州，柳江繞城而過，位居江右。就全省論，可以說正當中心。交通路綫，四通八達。在運輸上，是粵桂（柳江上游）問的中　都市。</p>
<p>合浦　日軍的進攻，除邕寗外，我們也不能忽略了另一條道路。就是循合浦鬱林東北行，以奪取蒼梧，阻塞粵桂的通路。然而日軍的行動，畢竟是不智的：由於使用龍門港之不盡便利，後繼上多少此蛟困難，西江我軍的佈置，力量也更見强實。另外値得指出的一點，就是對於法國的威脅。日軍好像祗在企圖切斷中越的通路，使我國軍火運輸上感受艱阻。然而我國一切預作的凖備，必使日本失望。而繼侵占海南島後深入粵南，在法國，至少是一種難堪，因爲他不能不感覺到：這是遠束利益動搖的開始。的確，日本在粵南的軍事動作，不能不說具有着國　的章義。</p>
<h3>我國黃金的產額</h3>
<p>— 菊</p>
<p>據今年出版的Atlesof　To—day　and　To—morrow　一書上說，世界現有的黃金總共的値二，八八九，〇〇，〇〇〇金鎊，美國儲存得最多，其次為央法。</p>
<p>我們中國雖然存金不多，但產金却並不少。最近統計，自本月份（二十八年十一月份）起，過去十二個月中，產金一八〇，〇〇〇盎斯，再回溯以前十二個月中爲一三〇，〇〇〇盎斯。從這數字裏，可以看出每年產金數額的增加。假如改良採取的方法，大規模的發掘起來，這些地下的寳藏可以說取之不絕，用之不盡呢。</p>
<p>據可靠的消息，我國的各銀行在過去十二個月裏，已替政府買存黃金十四萬三千盎斯。假如以每盎斯値二百元美金來計算，則各銀行收存黃金的價値當爲二力，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元美金云。</p>

<p>名人小傳</p>
<h3>美國駐法大使　佈立特　—羅斯福總統的心腹</h3>
<p>— 塵</p>
<p>威廉，佈立特WilliamBullit大使是羅斯福總統的親信，關於美國對歐外交政策的決定，佈氏係一影響極大的顧問，總統幾乎是言聽計從的。</p>
<p>正同其他的大使一樣，佈氏善詞令，富機智，有幹才，凡外交官應有之圓滑，彼均有之。我們應當記得，美國的大使並不是代表美國政府，也不是國會，也不是美國人民，他是代表決定外交策略的美國總統的。所以佈氏除時時由海錢轉遞消息至白宮外，每天差不多在越洋長途電話中與羅斯福氏有一次的接談。最近他回美國，促膝聯床，晤言一室，被總統挽留，欲行又止者計三次，足見他們如廖如漆的情感了。</p>
<p>美國的駐法使館，頗爲皇麗，計有房間一百七十處，這次歐戰發生，佈氏鎮日忙碌，時刻供給消息給羅氏。平時每月至少有九千封信及消息要他處理，又須接見賓客，戰時的公務，更屬煩冗。何况他又兼了海陸軍官及商務的代表，所以雖然居在這美輪美奐的大厦中，却過着極勞苦的生活。</p>
<p>他的交際費並不多，一年計美金四千八百元，倫教的大使則有美金七萬元，不過每年有美金四萬五千元的私人收入，加上政府給他的薪水美金一萬七千五百元，足够彌補其不足了。他的住宅在伊愛那路，可以說巴黎社交的中心處。他的日常運動，是髙而夫球及網球，尤愛騎馬。</p>
<p>飾民從幼生長在法國，法語極流俐，所以他做駐法大使是駕輕就熟，最為適宜。他的祖先有名呌約瑟婆來者，本來是法國人，在一六三七年移居美國。血統上旣有關係，自然與法國人有密切的情感。佛蘭納說：「佈立特現在與法國人的接近，好樣過去的三百年如一個星期似的。</p>
<p>近來美國修改中立法，廢止禁運軍火等，給英法以極大的援助，英國與美國同種，是應患難共濟，法國有這位美大使亦得力不少，所以美國雖爲愛正義出此，這些旁推側擊當亦爲原因之一罷。</p>
<h3>婦女與戰爭</h3>
<p>— 瑞文</p>
<p>婦女的像男子一樣參加戰爭，這是古已有之的事。在中世紀的時候，如果一個堡壘中的諸侯領兵到外面去打仗，那末那堡壘中的女主人遇見別的人率兵攻找，就得指揮手下的將士防衛那個堡壘。到了近代，婦女的參加後方工作，更爲活跟。一九一四年，上次大戰發生後，英國的男性，調赴法國作戰，那時久當承平之後，英國婦女，都是養尊處優，不曉得戰爭爲何物，每一個到前方去的英國士兵總以爲他們離開英國後，他們的婦女，永遠是和平地留在時代的後面。可是過了不久，當他們有機會請假回來的時候，使他國驚奇的是：婦女不但開救護車軍火輸送卡車，並且全英國變爲婦女工作的世界，火車上是婦女，電車上是婦女，並且婦女也穿上灰色的制服，往前綫把傷兵大批的運到後方，極爲勇敢可驚，遠不是他們想像那般柔弱可憐了。這次大戰後，一切防空救護的工作，都楚婦女担任，婦女在戰爭中更爲活躍了。</p>

<h3>中華基督敎會撫育工兒院</h3>
<p>— 徐英</p>
<p>筆者於日昨特地到延平路工兒院去訪辦事人陶庸拂先生，談起內部的情形如下：</p>
<p>創辦的經過</p>
<p>當創辦時候，就有工兒白人左右，到了民國十八年怡和紗廠撥出楡林路工房，由梅院長組織第二工兒院，於是院務就漸形發達了，當時有房屋三十三樓一二十三底足以容納工兒六百名，民國二十一年受申新五六廠之託，辦申新職工子弟學校於髙廊橋。民國二十六年春，又受申新一廠和八廠之託，在周家橋冉辦第二校。總計四處每年可收工兒一千人，最盛時曾達一千三百人，到八一三戰爭爆發，因爲院址在戰區，所以不能不遣散工兒，由梅院長率領五十名無家可歸的孤兒借居於仁濟育嬰堂內，到今春才遷到滬西延平路，繼續開學。除了五十名孤兒之外，　近的貧兒也可以免費入學，共有男女生三二八人，其中以走讀生居多，住校的學生須照家庭的經濟情形，略貼膳費。</p>
<p>現在的情形</p>
<p>現在的工兒院只有兩樓兩底的房屋，除了四間敎室之外（三四年級台用一敎，五六年級亦合併），只有兩問臥房，一間由晒臺搭成的房子作爲女生寢室，另一問作爲幼兒臥房，年長的男生在晚上只好權將書桌當臥榻了，地方雖小，收拾得却很淸潔，有條不紊。</p>
<p>以前工兒院分托兒所義務學校和孤兒院三部，凡是工人的子弟都能入托兒所，每天淸晨上工的時候，把孩子送來，由院中請的奶媽，護士和保姆代爲保育，到晚上放工的時候，再由父母領去，學校分幼稚園小學和中學，孤兒院裏的孩子多半是由他們的父母送來的，也有由敎會送來的</p>
<p>與家族關係</p>
<p>工兒並不與家屬脫離關係，雖然他們畢業之後可以自謀出路，院方也可以代爲介紹職業，至於無家屬的孤兒呢，年長的女孩，可以由院方代爲擇配，其他由院方介紹到工廠做工，或是到其他商家習藝，天資較高的，還有升學的希望，可是戰事爆發以來，市面不景氣，所以介紹孤兒出外服務也更難了。</p>
<p>經濟的情形</p>
<p>工兒院雖是基督敎性質，可是與敎會並無直接的關係，所以敎會方面並不給予經濟上的幫助，戰前院中每月開消的二千元，現在因爲縮小範圍，所以每月只須八百元，本來工廠和工部局每年都有津貼，不敷之數向外界募集，可是現在工廠停止了津貼，工部局又因院址在越界築路，所以又把津貼取消。因此工兒院的經濟更形拮据。最近梅院長遠赴美國，目的就是希望能募集一些款項作爲發展工兒院之用。</p>

<p>通常十分之二克蘭姆的砒霜可使人致命。但有一處地方—斯地里亞城（前屬奧國）的人，常用砒霜給嬰孩們吃，希望他們將來能長得美麗些：而這砒霜的食量是隨年歲增加，現在一個成人，可以吃三個克蘭姆的砒霜而毫無危臉。</p>
<p>美國紐加西州曼羅勃克地方的愛迪生紀念塔上，有一極大的電燈泡。這隻燈泡是由紐的康林玻璃製造廠定製的，長十四尺，最大直徑爲九尺六寸。燈泡中備有九百六十個白熱燈，和一面二十四寸的反射鏡，夜間發光可以照耀周圍百哩遠近的天空。</p>
<p>美國有九百以上的公司是由一萬數千憫從十六歲至二十一歲的男女孩子們所經營的，單是紐約就的有六十家。從僕人到經理都由孩子們担任。他們所販賣的貨品大槪是鳥籠，花盆，小刀，木碗，椅子，袖頭，玩具，烟盤，紙烟盒，錢袋，手杖，裁紙刀，以及日常零星的用具。</p>
<h3>關於「人」的話</h3>
<p>人平均一年要飲一噸水；如果依一噸等於一千五百斤計算，一人一天要飲的四斤一兩的水。</p>
<p>人平均一分鐘要呼吸十次；因此一整天二十四小時要呼吸二萬三百零四十次。每天須呼入空氣的重量爲二十一斤，一年須吸入七千六百六十五斤空氣。</p>
<p>血液在人體中的佔百分之五·五，如果出血至四分之三時，就要死去。譬如一人體重爲一百鎊，那麼他的血液有五鎊多，血如流出四鎊，便必死了。</p>
<p>人體的溫度是在攝氏表的三十六七之間，或多或少，均是病態。害傷寒的其熱度可升至四十六度以上。</p>
<p>人腦約重三十九兩多。</p>

<h3>Finnish Troops Fight Bravely, Halting Soviet Offensives on All Fronts; Petsamo Retaken, Over a Hundred Soviet Soldiers Captured; Fierce Fighting Continues on the Karelian Isthmus</h3>
<p>Oslo - It has been officially confirmed by Finnish authorities that Finnish troops have retaken the port of Petsamo in northern Finland, capturing 150 Soviet soldiers.  A constant stream of refugees, mostly the elderly, women, and children, continue to flee into Norway. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Zurich - The "Basler Abend-Zeitung's" correspondent in Stockholm reports that Soviet cavalry attempting to outflank Finnish troops north of Lake Ladoga have been repelled. The Finnish army is holding firm, utilizing forests and lakes, and Soviet tanks are unable to advance. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Official reports state that Soviet troops are active along the southeastern border, particularly around Lake Ladoga, where fighting is intense.  Attacking Soviet forces have been routed, thanks to new Finnish rifles specifically designed for forest warfare. Several villages and towns have been destroyed by fire, but Finnish losses are minimal.  Fighting is also fierce on the Karelian Isthmus, where, except in a few locations, the enemy has been pushed back. Fighting is ongoing.  The Soviets lost 11 tanks yesterday and at least eight more today.  Nine Soviet aircraft were lost today, while all Finnish aircraft returned safely. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>London - The Finnish embassy in London reports that, according to recent intelligence, military activity within Finland has almost ceased. This confirms reports that the Soviet advance along the Karelian Isthmus and north of Lake Ladoga has been halted. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki - News of the retaking of Petsamo in the north has been confirmed, eliciting joy and encouragement among the people.  Concerning the previous situation, Finnish troops still hold positions in front of the Mannerheim Line. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki - After continuous air raids in recent days, the Soviet army finally occupied Petsamo, a Finnish port on the Arctic coast, yesterday. Consequently, the entire Finnish Arctic coastline is now under Soviet control. While the port's strategic importance is not paramount, the Soviet Union's aim in occupying it is clearly to cut off the import of foreign military supplies to Finland. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Yesterday's Finnish victories included the destruction of 36 Soviet tanks, demonstrating the fighting spirit of the well-equipped Finnish troops. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>The Hague - According to a "Het Volk" correspondent, the accuracy of Finnish artillery fire has left a good impression on foreign observers, with an unexpectedly high hit rate. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Soviet Strategy for Attacking Finland</p>
<p>Zurich - "Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro" reports from Moscow that Soviet forces are attacking Finland on four fronts: (1) Advancing west from Murmansk in northern Russia to cut off Finland's northern sea access; (2) Advancing from the Karelian region towards central Finland; (3) Starting from the shores of Lake Ladoga to encircle Finnish forces on the Karelian Isthmus; and (4) Attacking the isthmus directly from the north of Leningrad, aiming to breach Finland's "Mannerheim Line," where the main battle is expected to occur. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Bombing from the Skies</p>
<p>Helsinki - After 1 PM today, Soviet bombers attacked Finnish coastal defenses and towns along the entire Karelian Isthmus. The southern coast of Ingo Island was also bombed.  It is reported that the bombing continued until 4 PM.  Thousands of refugees are fleeing north of Helsinki, sleeping in forests and along roads. Heavy snow has made transportation difficult. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 2, stating that Soviet aircraft bombed the capital city, Santahamina, Mäntsälä, Vaasa, Turku, Rauma, Tehtools, Salmijärvi, Hogland Island, Hanko Island, and the port of Viipuri today. Two aircraft were shot down by Finnish anti-aircraft fire, one in Santahamina and another in Mäntsälä. A factory was hit by a bomb, tragically killing 18 workers. Soviet aircraft also dropped incendiary bombs on Hogland Island. A major bridge in Salmijärvi was destroyed. During the bombing of the capital, they strafed innocent civilians with machine guns. Residents of the capital are being evacuated. Hanko Island was bombed three times in one day, and multiple fires broke out in the port of Viipuri after the bombing, still burning. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki - According to news from here today, the losses in Helsinki and many other cities were minimal despite yesterday's air raids. It is reported that 17 Soviet aircraft were shot down yesterday, with one Finnish Air Force captain accounting for six of them. According to reports from the Karelian front, no fewer than 19 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the past two days. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Air Raid Alarm in Helsinki</p>
<p>Helsinki - After a quiet night, residents of Helsinki were again startled by an air raid alarm at 8:45 AM this morning. Men and women rushed into air raid shelters. The streets quickly became deserted. However, this alarm was apparently a false one, as it was lifted five minutes later. The population of Helsinki may be forced to evacuate at any time. Major businesses have already relocated to other cities. Food supplies are still adequate, but food shops do not operate on a regular schedule, closing immediately upon hearing an alarm and not reopening that day.</p>
<p>Helsinki - A terrible tragedy occurred at the eastern edge of the city when a large number of people gathered in a large square, hoping to avoid being buried under rubble. Unexpectedly, Soviet planes dropped several bombs into the crowd. The Soviet planes flew very low, skimming over the rooftops, and opened fire on the frightened soldiers and civilians running for cover. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Soviet Ship Sunk</p>
<p>Helsinki - Finnish sources claim that one of the three Soviet destroyers shelling the fort at Ruusarö has been sunk by Finnish forces. The fort and Soviet ships exchanged fire for half the afternoon. Finnish forces destroyed ten Soviet tanks during fighting on the Uuksunjoki border of the Karelian Isthmus. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>London - News just received from Stockholm states that the Soviet cruiser "Kirov" was hit by a Finnish coastal defense battery while shelling Hanko Island yesterday, sustaining damage but not sinking. Another Soviet destroyer was sunk by Finnish coastal batteries. In addition, according to news from Helsinki, two battalions of Soviet infantry have been annihilated by Finnish forces. This unit came from the Ostrobothnia region, whose residents are known for seal hunting and marksmanship. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Molotov Urges the US to Stay Out of It; Responds to President Roosevelt's Appeal, Claiming the US is Too Far Away to Know the Truth</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet government responded yesterday in an abrupt tone to President Roosevelt's appeal that Soviet military aircraft not bomb Finnish civilian areas. The Soviet note advised the United States to stay out of the Soviet-Finnish war. Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov interrupted commercial negotiations with Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigenori Tōgō yesterday to receive US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt. Molotov replied that President Roosevelt's note was "baseless and based on misunderstanding." He said that the United States is 8,600 kilometers from the Soviet Union and therefore cannot determine the true purpose of the Soviet Union and events within Finland. He denied that Soviet aircraft were bombing any Finnish cities, stating that the Soviet Union had no intention of bombing Finnish cities because the Soviet government valued the interests of the Finnish people as much as other countries did. Soviet aircraft were only bombing Finnish airfields. (United Press, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Sweden May Mediate; Norwegian Press Condemns the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Zurich - It is reported that the Swedish government may mediate the conflict between Finland and the Soviet Union. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Oslo - Norwegian newspapers today unanimously condemned the Soviet Union's attack on Finland. "Tidens Tegn" stated that the Nordic people will not forget this painful period and that the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland sets a new record for baseness and recklessness. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>An Analysis of Soviet Actions</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union's invasion of Finland demonstrates that its negotiations with Finland over the past two months were merely a facade. The war has only been raging for three days, but given the Soviet Union's immense strength and careful planning, Finland, despite its best efforts, is not strong enough to resist. Moreover, there are traitors within Finland selling out their country and colluding with violent neighbors. Adding to this, the European continent is shrouded in the clouds of war, with powerful nations preoccupied and weak nations living in fear, so although international interests, grievances, and favors are complex and intertwined, Finland's appeals go unheard. Because of all this, we do not need to wait for the Soviet Union to occupy all of Finland to boldly predict that Finland will inevitably be unfortunate. Perhaps there is hope in one of two scenarios: first, that the Soviet Union has absolutely no ambition to annex Finland, whether militarily, politically, formally, or spiritually, and only seizes three or five strategically important locations for its own use, allowing Finland to remain an absolutely independent and free nation; second, that the Soviet-Finnish war is prolonged, and before the Soviet Union achieves total victory, the scope of the war expands immeasurably, making the Soviet-Finnish war a small part of a world war, which the two countries cannot resolve on their own and must await the restructuring of human thought and the establishment of international principles. In short, awaiting a global solution. These two hopes are not inherently impossible, but we still find them exceptionally remote. A newly emerging and refined peaceful nation is suddenly struck by a seemingly irresistible catastrophe, like a brilliant and handsome youth suddenly afflicted with a deadly plague, with no cure and life hanging by a thread; all those with a sense of justice cannot help but shed tears of sympathy!</p>
<p>The psychological and emotional impact of this Soviet action on the world is almost indescribably strong. We have historically been quite distant from Finland, with virtually no cultural, political, or commercial ties. Conversely, our relationship with the Soviet Union is far deeper, encompassing material, spiritual, and emotional aspects. However, even deep friendship cannot shake the judgment of right and wrong dictated by conscience, and intense stimulation can only be restrained by basing it on deep friendship to suppress its overflowing reaction. Therefore, concerning the current Soviet-Finnish issue, rather than offering stern criticism, it is better to attempt a lateral explanation.</p>
<p>Analyzing Soviet actions: it believes that the current European war is the Second World War of imperialism, and that this world war did not begin today, with the September 18 Incident years ago already being the beginning of this war. However, the Italian-Abyssinian War, the Spanish Civil War, Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia and Austria, and even the Sino-Japanese War in the East since the September 18 Incident were all imperialist aggressions against weak nations and small countries; while the current European war is imperialists fighting among themselves, a new stage in the world war. In the previous stage, the Soviet Union's strategy was to organize a united front of democratic nations and weak nations to oppose aggressive fascism; in the current new stage, the Soviet Union's strategy has changed. It hates fascist imperialism and even more so anti-fascist imperialism. This is certainly not because fascist theories and spirits are superior to anti-fascist ones, causing the Soviet Union to hate them to different degrees; rather, it is because the Soviet Union, based on its own interests and communist system, weighs the advantages and disadvantages, distinguishes between urgent and less urgent matters, and thus differentiates between friends and enemies. The most cynical view is that the Soviet Union's differentiation between friends and enemies has facilitated the European war and even seeks to manipulate it into becoming a world war. In reality, the existence of contradictions between fascism and anti-fascism will inevitably lead to war; the scope of that war, whether involving several nations, all of Europe, or the entire world, depends entirely on the two sides of the contradiction and does not require the Soviet Union to facilitate or manipulate it. The Soviet Union has simply seized the opportunity of the current new stage, never hesitating, never letting go, and doing several things most beneficial to its own interests. Striving for the most beneficial to its own interests is the most basic desire; the so-called strategy of the previous stage and the strategy of the current stage have already changed at a very large angle, and even greater angle changes are not surprising or magical; because any change, any strategy, does not violate its consistent spirit of striving to implement its desires! It just so happens that fascist leaders covet every chestnut and possess the fearless spirit of plucking chestnuts from the fire; thus, they complement each other, evolving into the current situation of raging flames.</p>
<p>In past years, because of poverty, the Soviet Union declared a change in style, promising not to actively promote its communist system to other countries, in exchange for international resources. Then, it proceeded with comprehensive construction: this declaration originally could not nullify the supranational nature of its system. Its nature is such, so the partition of Poland and the invasion of Finland are, in its subjective view, entirely right, with absolutely no wrong. To be more precise: regarding Poland, the world sees this as a partition by the Soviet Union and Germany, but from the Soviet perspective, it is not a so-called partition. It only believes that the environmental situation at the time dictated that it should, in fact, extend beyond its original boundaries to the boundaries it now occupies: as for the remaining part, it is not considered to be given to Germany through partition but is simply regarded as not yet belonging to the Soviet Union. Regarding Finland, the world considers the Soviet Union's so-called feeling of being threatened by Finland to be a shameless lie; in reality, it is not a lie. The Soviet Union under the communist system genuinely believes that non-communist countries outside its borders are all threats to the Soviet Union, with Finland being only one aspect of that threat. If one were to say that the equator threatens the frigid zone, that the Southern Ocean threatens the Arctic Ocean, this, in Soviet logic, is definitely not incomprehensible. Based on this logic, expanding its defense into other countries' territories, constituting class struggle within those countries, is sufficient to enhance the security of the Soviet Union and weaken threats to the Soviet Union, all of which are the norm for the Soviet Union, and are part of the international topic!</p>
<p>If it is beneficial to befriend fascism, then befriend fascism; if it is convenient to take Finland, then take Finland: benefit and convenience are the principles of all Soviet actions. Participating in any aspect of the current stage of the war in violation of the principles of benefit and convenience is what the Soviet Union will certainly not do. If Britain and France fear Soviet participation in the war, this is a groundless worry. If Japan wants the Soviet Union to abandon its own interests and collude with it, this is limited by the necessary conditions that Japan must have the determination to "fight" with other imperialists and not create the possibility of Japan threatening the Soviet Union, increasing Japan's territory and power of threat to the Soviet Union. Japan does not have this determination and violates this condition, then thinking of colluding with the Soviet Union is delusional. The reason why China can maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union is that China fundamentally overflows with a non-threatening mediocrity.</p>
<h3>New Finnish Cabinet Formed; Willing to Seek Honorable Peace, On Condition that Independence and Sovereignty Are Not Compromised; Will Resist Violent Aggression with All Efforts</h3>
<p>Helsinki - After the resignation of the Cajander cabinet, Risto Ryti, Governor of the Bank of Finland, has formed a new cabinet, which has now been established. The cabinet members are as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Risto Ryti (Governor of the Bank of Finland)</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: Väinö Tanner (Former Finance Minister)</p>
<p>Interior Minister: Ernst von Born (Leader of the Swedish People's Party, former Minister without Portfolio)</p>
<p>Defense Minister: Juho Niukkanen (Immediate appointment)</p>
<p>Finance Minister: Mauno Pekkala (Former Minister of Agriculture)</p>
<p>Minister of Justice: Johan Otto Söderhjelm (Leader of the Swedish People's Party)</p>
<p>Minister without Portfolio: Juho Kusti Paasikivi (Former Envoy to Sweden) (Havas, 1st) According to sources, the new Prime Minister Ryti is not a well-known figure in politics. Foreign Minister Tanner, the former Minister of Finance, is the leader of the Social Democratic Party and has been to the Soviet Union to participate in the Moscow talks. What is noteworthy about the new cabinet is the appointment of the envoy to Sweden, Paasikivi, as Minister without Portfolio. Paasikivi was the chief representative who participated in the Moscow talks. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>New York - Risto Ryti, the former Governor of the Bank of Finland and current Prime Minister, issued a broadcast today stating, "We are willing to negotiate all issues, but we are not prepared to relinquish our independence or our right to decide our own affairs." He also said, "The Finnish people demand the right to continue to achieve their political independence." (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>The Finnish Ambassador to the United States, Astrom, also spoke to the press here, saying that the new cabinet is a coalition cabinet including all parties and factions, and will continue to pursue an independent and neutral policy. The "puppet government" established by the Soviet Union in our country is enough to prove the value of the declaration previously issued by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. In short, the policy pursued by the Soviet Union is to incorporate Finland into its territory and endow it with Bolshevik-style freedom. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>London - Following the formation of the new Finnish cabinet, well-informed sources here stated that while the new cabinet is prepared to negotiate with the Soviet authorities to seek an honorable peace, if the Soviet Union continues its aggression, Finland will resolutely resist to the end. Given that the Soviet Union has established a "Finnish Revolutionary Government" in the Karelian region, it is clear that Finland's attempt to propose honorable peace terms to the Soviet Union has very little hope of success. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Tanner Speaks</h3>
<p>Helsinki - The new Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner, in an interview yesterday with a reporter from the "Social Democratic Newspaper" of Helsinki, declared, "The previous government considered the situation too serious, and the only way to make way for the virtuous and form a coalition government was to resign. Our strong neighbor, Soviet Russia, wants to eliminate the Finnish nation and force us to accept unacceptable conditions. This is the situation that the new government is addressing. We will do our best to find out whether understanding with the Soviet Union is possible. We consider safeguarding Finland's independence and security to be the only issue of the new government; all other issues are set aside." (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<h3>First Meeting of the New Finnish Cabinet</h3>
<p>Helsinki - The Ryti cabinet held its first meeting at 6 PM today to discuss current issues. According to official statements, the members of the "Communist Government" established in Terijoki are all domestic fugitives who recently returned from the Soviet Union and are insufficient to represent public opinion. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Policy Guidelines Passed by Parliament</h3>
<p>Zurich - According to news from Helsinki, after the establishment of the new cabinet, the Finnish parliament held a meeting in an air raid shelter this morning and immediately unanimously approved the cabinet's policy guidelines. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Finnish Commander-in-Chief Encourages Troops</h3>
<p>Helsinki - Finnish Commander-in-Chief Marshal Mannerheim today issued a general order to all troops, encouraging every soldier to fulfill their duty, stating, "The war for our independence is still continuing. We are now entering the final stage. We are fighting for our country." (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Red Government Established Within Finland; Current Organization is Provisional; Soviet Union has Officially Recognized It</h3>
<p>Moscow - News from Leningrad: A "new government" called the "People's Government of the Democratic Republic of Finland" has been established in the Finnish border town of Terijoki today. It is jointly composed of representatives from Finnish left-wing parties and defecting Finnish soldiers. The list of members of the new government is as follows: "Chairman" and "Foreign Minister": Otto Kuusinen; "Finance Minister": Mauri Rosenberg; "Defense Minister": Akseli Anttila; "Interior Minister": Tuure Lehén; "Agriculture Minister": Armas Äikiä; "Education Minister": Inkeri Lehtinen; "Minister for Karelian Affairs": Paavo Prokkonen. The "People's Government" has also issued a declaration announcing its "Political Program." (TASS, 1st)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Chairman and Foreign Minister of the Finnish People's Government, Kuusinen, yesterday sent an official document to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, stating that the Finnish People's Government has been established and proposing the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Finnish Democratic Republic. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet immediately decided to recognize the Finnish People's Government and establish diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Finnish Democratic Republic. (TASS, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Finnish "People's Government," Kuusinen, was born in 1881 and joined the Communist Party in 1905. From 1918 to 1919, he was a member of the revolutionary government. After Finland seceded from Russia, Kuusinen was very active in the Communist Party, serving as the chairman of the Finnish Communist Party and the secretary of the Executive Committee. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to a Moscow dispatch received by the German official news agency, the Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party today issued a statement explaining the basis on which the Soviet Union could immediately cease hostilities and negotiate peace as follows: (1) The formation of a democratic people's government; (2) The conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland; (3) Certain changes in the national and economic life structure of Finland, but not the Bolshevization of Finland. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>Moscow: This station has just received a broadcast declaration from the People's Government of Finland as follows (translated from Finnish broadcast):</p>
<p>"The Provisional People's Government of Finland, based on the will of the people who hate the vicious policies of the Kallio and Tanner governments, was established today in eastern Finland. This government calls on all the people of the country to rise up and overthrow the tyrannical rule of those butchers and challengers. In 1918, those reactionary wealthy rulers, relying on the power of foreign imperialists, destroyed the democracy and freedom of our working masses, turning our country into a prison controlled by the White Guards. After selling out Finland's independent rights and interests, they united with the imperialists, the common enemy of the Finnish and Soviet peoples, and incited anti-Soviet war in every possible way, finally leading our country into war with our friend, the socialist Soviet Union. Under this kind of crisis, the Finnish working masses, who have always wished to coexist peacefully with the Soviet people, have no choice but to rise up and save the fate of their motherland and exercise their sacred powers. Now, the people in various parts of the country have risen up and declared the organization of a democratic republic. Some soldiers have also joined the new People's Government. The Soviet Union has never threatened or disturbed our country. On the contrary, it has always respected our country's independence and has repeatedly tolerated the challenging actions of the Finnish White rulers for twenty years. However, today the Soviet Union has no choice but to use the power of the Red Army to stop the threat to its independence. This goal is also completely in line with the interests of our people. Therefore, the Finnish people unanimously welcome the Red Army, knowing that its entry into Finland is not to conquer our country, but to liberate our people. The People's Government firmly believes that the Soviet Union has no intention of harming our country's independence, so it also supports the Red Army's actions within our country, believing that the Soviet Union's purpose is to help our people and work together with our people to eliminate the war bases created by the malicious challenger government in our country. To complete this task, the People's Government welcomes the Soviet government to provide all necessary assistance to the Finnish Democratic Republic through the Red Army.</p>
<p>In order to fight together with the Soviet Red Army, the People's Government has organized the First Finnish Corps. In future battles, this corps will absorb revolutionary workers and peasants who volunteer to join the army at any time, becoming the backbone of the future Finnish People's Army. This First Corps will raise high the national flag of the Finnish Democratic Republic, enter the capital, and plant it on the Presidential Palace, making all the people rejoice and the enemies tremble. Our country must become a democratic republic that serves the people, different from the rich republic of capitalists, landlords, and running dogs like Kallio and others. But our country is not a Soviet country, because the Soviet regime cannot be established by the government's sole power without regard to the public opinion of the people, especially the peasants. Therefore, our government is the People's Government of the Finnish Democratic Republic, backed by the broad laboring people's front. The current organization of the People's Government is of a provisional nature. After moving to the capital Helsinki and being formally recognized, its organization will be expanded to include representatives of all parties participating in the laboring people's front. Its final organization, its powers, and its actions will be approved by the parliament elected based on universal, equal, direct participation, and secret ballot.</p>
<p>The People's Government recognizes that its primary tasks are to overthrow the Finnish White Guard government, defeat its armed forces, conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, and establish permanent friendly relations, thereby guaranteeing Finland's independence and security. The People's Government has proposed to the Soviet government the signing of a Finnish-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and, in accordance with the wishes of the Finnish nation, to reunite the Karelian people with independent Finland. The People's Government firmly believes that its resolute policy of friendship with the Soviet Union will enable the Soviet Union to accept this proposal. The People's Government is willing to maintain friendly relations with all other countries and recognizes Finland's economic and financial obligations to other countries, provided that these obligations do not violate Finland's sovereignty and that other countries do not take hostile steps against the Finnish Democratic Republic and its government."</p>
<h3>Policy Outline</h3>
<p>Regarding domestic affairs, the People's Government has determined the following policies: (1) Establish the Finnish People's Army; (2) Private large-scale banks and industries will be subject to government control, while efforts will be made to support small and medium-sized enterprises; (3) Implement measures to eliminate unemployment; (4) Reduce working hours to eight hours per day and stipulate that each worker or employee should have two weeks of summer vacation; (5) Confiscate the land belonging to large landowners, but will not violate the land property of farmers, and will distribute the confiscated land to farmers who originally had no land or very little land; (6) Exempt farmers from overdue taxes; (7) The state will provide assistance in developing the economy of poor peasants, first by providing more land, pastures, and even forests if necessary, to poor peasants for their needs. This land is confiscated from large landowners; (8) Democratize all state organs and courts; (9) Increase state funding for cultural needs and improve schools. All workers and other children who cannot afford to attend school will be given the opportunity to study, and close attention will be paid to the development of public education, science, literature, and art.</p>
<p>According to recent news, the Kallio wealthy government, which has plunged the country into ruin and is hated by the people, has now resigned due to being abandoned by the people, and the Tanner government has been organized to replace it. However, Tanner and Kallio are both public enemies of the people, and their government is of the same ilk as Kallio's, both hated by our people. Our people must drive out these butchers and overthrow all bankrupt government party members. All Finnish working masses must rise up to resist the oppression and tyranny of the butchers, protect our country's future, throw off the heavy burden on our people's shoulders, and clear the obstacles ahead, in order to strive for the cultural well-being of the people, which is the wish of our nation for thousands of years. Strive for the victory of the cause of Finnish workers, peasants, and working intellectuals themselves, and march towards victory under the banner of the independent and free Finnish Democratic Republic." December 1, 1939 (TASS dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Molotov Issues Statement, Government Reorganization in Finnish Capital Deemed Useless</h3>
<p>Moscow: Molotov recently issued a statement to the United States regarding the development of the Finnish issue, stating that the resignation of the Kallio government and its replacement by the Tanner government is, in fact, useless. Tanner is clearly not a suitable candidate. Tanner was an ominous figure in the recent Soviet-Finnish negotiations. If the Soviet-Finnish negotiations had not been attended by Tanner and were presided over by Paasikivi, the negotiations would have been successfully concluded. Tanner's participation has completely failed the negotiations and has bound Paasikivi, preventing him from fully exerting his talents. In view of this fact, the Soviet Union knows that the Tanner government will not help the matter. Moreover, the Finnish People's Government organized by Kuusinen has been established, and important facts make the Soviet Union expect to obtain a peaceful and satisfactory solution.

<h3>Soviet War Report</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to a communiqué issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, the troops in the Leningrad Military District continued to advance yesterday: (1) Soviet troops advanced westward from the northern port of Murmansk and have occupied the port of Petsamo; (2) Those advancing westward from the city of Libera have approached the Namsi railway station; (3) Those crossing the border from the two towns of Porusajärvi and Pitäjäätskoski have penetrated 25 kilometers into Finnish territory; (4) The Soviet army in the Karelian Isthmus has reached the mouth of the Töppölänjoki River (along Lake Ladoga) and occupied the Raida station on the Koivisto railway, and then crossed the city of Terijoki, occupying the intersection of the cities of Zelenogorsk and Vammelsuu, advancing along the railway towards Koivisto. The retreating Finnish army burned villages and forced the people to evacuate. The Finnish Air Force attempted to bomb the Soviet army in the Karelian Isthmus, but was repelled by the Soviet Air Force. When Soviet aircraft carried out bombing raids, Finnish aircraft attempted to engage Soviet aircraft, resulting in the downing of ten Finnish aircraft, while two Soviet aircraft did not return to base.

<h3>Eastern Newspaper Commentary on Soviet-Finnish Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Today, various newspapers in this city have commented on the Soviet-Finnish conflict. The Japan Broad Knowledge News, under the title "Pure Aggression," stated that apart from the Soviet Union and Germany, no one has failed to express sympathy for Finland upon hearing this news. The "China and Foreign Commercial News" also condemned the actions taken by the Soviet Union, but stated that if the United States, Britain, and France do not immediately provide Finland with effective assistance, they will abandon their right to speak on the new situation in East Asia. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that it is unknown whether the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States will provide assistance to Finland, but even if they do, it may not be very effective, because the resources and military equipment of the Soviet Union and Finland are too disparate. It also stated that after the end of the Finnish incident, the Soviet Union may focus its attention on the Ruthenian region, even if friction occurs with Italy, it will not care. Observing the different attitudes of Germany and Italy towards the Soviet Union's attack on Finland this time, everything can be foreseen. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Suining Province War Achievements in the Past Six Months</h3>
<p>Xi'an: All aspects of the Party, government, and military in Suining Province have been adjusted and unified in the past six months, and have made rapid progress and outstanding achievements. Judging from the war achievements alone, it is quite in line with accumulating small victories to make big victories, and achieving the goal of consuming Japanese resources. There were 95 battles of various sizes in the past six months, 21 in April, 15 in May, 10 in June, 6 in July, 18 in August, 13 in September, and 14 in October, killing a total of 4,131 Japanese and puppet troops, capturing 163 horses, 377 rifles, 21 machine guns, shooting down one plane, destroying 92 cars, and capturing one car. In addition, one Japanese political instructor, Fujisawa, and one puppet reconnaissance chief, Guo Zhongyi, were captured. Comprehensive observation of the recent situation shows that all the installations set up by Japan on the Ping-Sui Line are intended to be permanent in nature. For example, roads and bunkers are built with foreign cement and steel bars, and the Ping-Sui Line is deliberately managed. The bridges along the line from Baotou to Guyang are all new-style engineering. The Baotou Japanese airfield is large in scale and is the best in North China. The construction of the aircraft depot is particularly huge. All of these are sufficient to prove that Japan wants to permanently occupy the border area of ​​Suimeng and expresses its determination to prepare for war against Mongolia and the Soviet Union.

A Central News Agency reporter recently showed his two articles (Prediction of the Japanese Ending) on his views on the Sino-Japanese war situation, asserting that Japan will one day take off its military uniforms, surrender its arms, and surrender. The gist of his article is: "Japan has banned the people from eating eggs in exchange for military supplies. It has ordered bathhouses to close to save coal to make military supplies. It has banned the people from wearing leather shoes and making new clothes to supply military uniforms. His financial and material resources are exhausted, which is conceivable. He has ordered 30,000 overseas Chinese in China to enlist in the army, and his small population is also conceivable. Some people have raised questions, 'Since Japan has clearly seen that there is only a dead end ahead, why doesn't it withdraw its troops and escape?' I think that Japan will never dare to withdraw its troops happily. This is equivalent to us fighting for another hundred years and not being able to negotiate peace before the Japanese army withdraws from the country, because we can never recognize the 'September 18th' invasion as an accomplished fact, so we must resist the war. The goal of resisting the war cannot be achieved in one day, and we cannot negotiate peace in one day. This is our interpretation of resisting the war to the end. As for him, the Japanese warlords have exhausted their big words. Didn't they say that 500 million military expenses, three divisions of troops, and five months of time would completely solve the 'China Incident'? Not only his own emperor and people are used to hearing these words, but Westerners have also heard enough of them. Now, if he suddenly withdraws his troops, not only will Westerners laugh at him, will the people of his own country silently agree? Moreover, can the country contain more than one million Japanese soldiers? And there is a deficit of 20,000 million yuan, can this account be submitted? Therefore, his future result is only that the soldiers themselves take off their military uniforms, drop their guns and cannons and ask us to take them in as ordinary people. At this time, their rulers have been eliminated. This time is not very far away, as early as next spring, and at the latest it will not pass the autumn of next year. Now is the time for our people to be united on a single front, unanimously obey the supreme leader, and finally contribute money, shed blood and sweat. Not only do we not agree to negotiate peace, but we also do not hope that Japan will withdraw its troops safely and happily, so as to avoid future troubles for our descendants."

<h3>He Yaozu Still in Chongqing Today, Japanese Rumors Are All Groundless</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Recent news from the Japanese side in Hong Kong stated that General He Yaozu, the newly appointed Chinese ambassador to Moscow, has not yet presented his credentials due to the Soviet government's deliberate difficulties. Today, the government spokesman in this city firmly denied this statement to a Reuters interviewer and said that General He is not only not the newly appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union, but he is still in Chongqing today and has not gone to the Soviet Union. However, officials here do not admit the possibility of General He going to Moscow, but if General He makes this trip, it is not because he is the new Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union, so the Japanese statement that he presented his credentials is purely groundless.

<h3>Roosevelt States Attitude Towards Soviet Union Under Consideration, Possibility of Severing Relations Between U.S. and Soviet Union, American Aircraft Factories No Longer Supplying Military Aircraft to Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt today read a formal statement at a press conference, stating that he will discuss the situation in the Baltic Sea with congressional leaders by telephone, but he does not intend to convene a formal meeting. Before the Soviet Union invaded Finland, the United States issued a diplomatic note expressing its willingness to mediate the dispute between the Soviet Union and Finland, but the Soviet Union has not yet responded. The United States now publicly and formally stands on the side of Finland, which is one of the various steps currently being discussed in the United States to show the attitude of the United States towards the actions of the Soviet Union. There is still the possibility of recalling the American ambassador to Moscow to return home for consultations and severing diplomatic relations with Finland. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt told a government official here yesterday that due to the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, he was under great pressure from influential people to sever relations with the Soviet Union. It is said that the President stated that he and Secretary of State Hull did not intend to make a hasty decision on this issue. Rumors here are that the Soviet representative in the United States is trying to order a large number of American aircraft from the United States. The government departments responsible for implementing the Neutrality Act yesterday considered the possibility of implementing an informal ban on arms exports to the Soviet Union, similar to the current moral sanctions against Japan. In October, the Soviet Union purchased only US$8,800 worth of aircraft from the United States. In 1939, the Soviet Union purchased aircraft, propellers, and engines worth a total of US$1,066,000 from the United States. At this time, Democratic Congressman Tiah claimed that he would submit a resolution to the next Congress to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. He stated that the Soviet invasion of Finland was a "reprehensible matter." The United States recognizes this as the first wrong step by the Soviet Communist government. Republican Congressmen Fish and Sun expressed similar opinions. Democratic Congressman Panjin requested the government to "strive to eliminate the forces of the Communist Party in the United States." Republican Senator Bo Shu claimed that severing diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union would not help world peace and would not help Finland resist the Soviet invasion. The Soviet Union's actions are indeed surprising, but "we must remember that when building world peace, the United States must be in a position to speak. I feel that we can best maintain peace and humanitarianism by striving to maintain normal relations with all warring countries." (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull indicated today while hosting a press conference that the United States will impose a "moral" ban on aircraft and munitions bound for the Soviet Union when it receives more detailed official reports. He also said that the same ban will also be applied to Japan. The Department of the Army has just announced that it will no longer allow military supplies to be shipped to the Soviet Union. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>New York - According to the Washington Bangbao today, American aircraft manufacturers have stopped supplying military aircraft to the Soviet Union. A delegation from the Soviet government has been rushing to various factories to buy all kinds of fighter planes with huge amounts of cash, but no one responded. The reason for the aircraft manufacturers to do this is that the U.S. Army Department announced yesterday that it would no longer allow ships to continue to carry military supplies to the Soviet Union.

<p>Amsterdam - The Manchester Guardian's naval correspondent reported from London that an investigation had been conducted into the loss of the auxiliary cruiser "Rawalpindi." The ship had no armored protection and was patrolling the North Atlantic. Once it encountered a German warship with modern equipment, it was naturally unable to resist. However, there was another reason why the British Admiralty sent the ship to patrol the North Atlantic. The Royal Navy's sixty cruisers were scattered across the oceans, and it was necessary to temporarily assign the patrol mission to "Rawalpindi." (2nd Haitong dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Relationship with Britain and the Soviet Union Is Delicate</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, all Japanese newspapers disapprove of the Soviet Union's actions, which is attracting great attention here. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union wants to resolve various outstanding issues with Japan in the Far East in order to be able to act freely in Europe. Judging from the comments made by Japanese newspapers, this Soviet attempt may not succeed. In addition, the Soviet Union and Japan will conduct business negotiations within a short period of time. Soviet newspapers are doing their best to reduce the importance of these negotiations, saying that what Japan is requesting is to obtain fishing rights. In view of this, British people believe that in order to ease the situation in the Far East and to satisfy its ambitions in Europe, the Soviet Union may pay Japan a heavy price. In other words, it may propose to Japan issues other than fishery issues, thereby seeking a solution. This is what Japan would like to obtain a temporary understanding with in China. However, the agreement that Japan and the Soviet Union can reach is a truce agreement for those who are tired of war, not a true agreement. Because the Soviet Union has not clearly explained what ambitions it has for China, Xinjiang Province may become a true protectorate of the Soviet Union, and Japan is not without concern. As for the relationship between Britain and Japan, after the British government announced a blockade of German exports, Japan threatened to take retaliatory measures, and relations between the two sides became tense. Regarding this matter, the British government has already made some concessions. Goods purchased by various neutral countries from Germany, the money of which has been paid, will still be released. Tokyo has thus been impressed and there is a possibility of reaching an understanding between the two sides. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>London Times Military Correspondent Hart Resigns</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - Political figures in London are extremely surprised by the resignation of Captain Hart, the famous military expert of "The Times," and his replacement by Captain Fours. It is understood that the reason for Captain Hart's resignation was disagreement with the editorial department of "The Times," because he advocated two things: (1) an automatic military policy, (2) replacing old officers with young officers. The above two points are slightly different from the current general public opinion in the United Kingdom, so "The Times" hired another military reporter to replace this most famous military writer in the United Kingdom.

<h3>Submarine Warfare and Minefields</h3>
<p>— London Correspondence</p>
<p>Economics is always the background of war. The focus of the Second European War is on the sea. Observing the intensity of submarine bombings and the strictness of mine blockades, one can imagine. British merchant ships that are not equipped with cannons do not dare to travel alone in the dangerous areas of the Atlantic Ocean. They generally travel in groups, accompanied and protected by large warships on the left and right, with submarines advancing on the left and right to open the way and guard the rear. This is called the Convoy System in English, and can also be translated as the escort system. If a British merchant ship discovers an enemy mine at sea, the simplest way to destroy the mine is to telegraph nearby waiting fishing boats to use the speed of their motors to find and remotely strike with cannons. The dangerous area of the sea in the Second European War extends from 60 degrees north latitude, the northernmost part of British territory, the Shetland Islands, to 30 degrees north latitude, the west coast of French Morocco in Africa, with 15 degrees west longitude of the Atlantic Ocean as the boundary to the west, and to the east from the French coast, including the North Sea along the coasts of Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, England and Germany, as well as the East Sea, i.e., the Baltic Sea along the coasts of Sweden, Germany and Denmark. As shown in the attached map, the British and German sides have densely laid minefields in the North Sea, with German minefields protecting the west coast of Germany and British minefields protecting the east coast of England. In addition, a large British minefield blocks the German coastline. A large sandy beach straddling 1 degree to 5 degrees east longitude is sandwiched in the middle. The northern route is completely blocked, and the southern route is blocked north of 51 degrees north latitude directly opposite the mouth of London, leaving only a shallow waterway between the east coast of England and the La Sandettie sandbar, which is not laid with mines to allow entry and exit. Apart from the territorial waters within three nautical miles of the coast of neutral countries, which are non-mine areas, anywhere else, any ship of any country is at risk of hitting a mine if it does not carefully follow the safe waterways that are left out. In the cold season from November to March of the following year, the wind and waves on the sea increase, and mines placed below sea level must break free and float to the surface. If the current is rapid at this time, even ships 50 miles away from the minefield will inevitably be sunk.</p>
<p>There are two types of mines. One type is used to destroy submarines, and must sink to the seabed before floating up, remaining at a depth of 80 to 100 feet (about 30 meters) below the sea surface, surrounded by tentacles to form a net. If a submarine mistakenly passes by, even if it does not come close to the mine but slightly touches the tentacles, it can explode. During the four-year European War last time, German submarines destroyed in this way accounted for a quarter. There is no way to escape from an underwater explosion. Of all the death-defying adventures in the world, the people in submarines are undoubtedly the most courageous. The other type of mine is to destroy all sizes of ships on the sea surface. The depth at which it stays in the water should vary depending on the size and type of the ship. For example, if a large warship comes to a calm sea with no wind before high tide, and the mine below it is 12 yards (about 8 meters) deep in the water, it may be lucky enough to pass through without exploding. However, the tides rise and fall indefinitely during the day. For example, in Bristol Channel on the west coast of England, the tides rise and fall 40 feet (about 13 meters) every day, so it can find the dangerous time to explode. In just a few minutes within 24 hours, the mine hitting the sea and avoiding it depends on precise calculations. The degree of danger is just like a bomb falling from the air, not everyone is without a chance to escape. The height at which a mine stays in the sea is first carefully calculated based on the water pressure at different depths below the sea surface to make it self-assemble and move accurately. A mine is a large sphere, weighing 700 to 800 kilograms and has a diameter of 3 feet 6 inches (more than one meter), larger than a round table. The surface of the sphere is covered with glass bubbles that break upon impact, containing chemical materials that can generate electricity and heat. The cost of each mine is about 200 British pounds. There has been no major change in the past 25 years. At the end of the First European War, the United Kingdom used as many as 120,000 mines to cut across the North Sea. If the mines are placed in the sea without specialized patrol boats to cut the cables to destroy them, it is feared that they will still explode upon contact for two years after the armistice, and will harm ocean traffic.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education's Improvement: Social Education Plan (3) Cultivating and Guaranteeing Social Education Personnel Implementing Special and Relief Education</h3>
<p>(D) Compiling, reviewing, and promoting popular reading materials for social education. The compilation of various teaching materials is of great importance. In the past, the Ministry of Education had compiled two types of textbooks and teaching methods for people's schools, and one type each for abacus textbooks and teaching methods. Recently, it organized a committee to compile popular self-study textbooks, patriotic story songs, comic strips, and other popular reading materials. In addition to the Ministry designing and directly promoting these materials, various provinces and cities should assist in promoting them to ensure they are recited in every household. Popular reading materials already circulating in various provinces, counties, and cities should be reviewed, and local worthy stories, local teaching materials, novels, songs, etc., should be compiled to ensure that harmful reading materials disappear from the public and those circulating are rich in educational meaning. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In addition to continuing to compile and print supplementary reading materials for the public, the Ministry of Education should also compile two sets of "Must-Read for Citizens," providing a comprehensive and concise description of China's history, geography, politics, morality, etc., so that the general public can have a clear understanding of Chinese culture. In addition to compiling these teaching materials into reading materials, it is also planned to compile the content into materials for movies, slides, broadcasts, music, dramas, storytelling, etc., to achieve the effect of educating the public.</p>
<p>(2) Excellent popular reading materials edited, reviewed, and announced by the Ministry of Education should be promoted by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities using the following methods:</p>
<p>a. Issue orders to all social education institutions and schools under their jurisdiction to adopt them.</p>
<p>b. Issue orders to all public education centers under their jurisdiction to contact and train local ballad singers to perform them widely.</p>
<p>c. Introduce them to bookstores and stalls to promote them on their behalf.</p>
<p>d. Imitate printing and distribution.</p>
<p>(3) The following types of popular reading materials should be reviewed by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, and those that are not good should be banned:</p>
<p>a. Novels, songs, plays, etc., that are already circulating among the people should be widely collected and reviewed. b. Newly published popular reading materials in the market should be required to be submitted for review by bookstores and publishers in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>c. Popular reading materials compiled and used by the education bureaus, sections, schools, and social education institutions of various counties and cities in the province should be submitted for review.</p>
<p>(4) Popular reading materials prohibited from publication by the Ministry of Education or central party and government agencies should be uniformly investigated and banned by the education administrative agencies of various provinces, cities, and counties in accordance with the order.</p>
<p>(5) The following types of popular reading materials should be compiled by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities and submitted to the Ministry for review:</p>
<p>a. Supplementary teaching materials for public schools in the province and city.</p>
<p>b. Stories of local worthies, anti-Japanese war stories, legendary novels, ditties, plays, songs, proverbs, etc., in the province and city.</p>
<p>(E) Cultivating Social Education Personnel The success of social education is greatly related to the quality of the personnel. Social education is a difficult work, and those who handle it cannot succeed without a firm will and a spirit of hard work and endurance. Now that social education is becoming increasingly developed, it is imperative to establish specialized training institutions at all levels to cultivate service personnel. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>a. In addition to the Ministry of Education planning to establish national social education personnel training institutions to cultivate senior personnel of central and provincial social education institutions in batches, each province should establish social education personnel training institutions according to the needs of social education development to provide general social education training and select various specialized skills in social education for group study.</p>
<p>b. Normal schools should add social education courses (emphasizing both theory and practice) to train primary school teachers to have the skills to concurrently handle social education.</p>
<p>(F) Guaranteeing Social Education Service Personnel Social education personnel and school teachers and staff both serve the country. They should go deep into the countryside at ordinary times regardless of the cold or heat. During wartime, they either face the front or travel thousands of miles, diligently teaching and enduring hardships. Therefore, cases of death or injury resulting in disability in the line of duty, whether in peacetime or wartime, are frequently seen. However, there are still no laws and regulations that can be cited for old-age care and pensions. In order to show the fairness of national treatment and to stimulate service enthusiasm, service personnel of social education institutions should receive the same old-age pensions and survivor benefits as teachers and staff of military academies. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education should submit a request to the Executive Yuan to consult with the Legislative Yuan to amend the regulations on old-age pensions and survivor benefits for school teachers and staff so that they apply equally to service personnel of social education institutions or to formulate separate regulations on old-age pensions and survivor benefits for service personnel of social education institutions.</p>
<p>(G) Supervising Schools at All Levels to Concurrently Run Social Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education promulgated and implemented the Measures for Schools at All Levels to Concurrently Run Social Education in May of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938]. However, school education has always been limited to the inside of schools, and this has become a deep-rooted habit, making it difficult to change. Now, in order to correct old concepts, expand the scope of education, make schools social and cultural centers, adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and complete the mission of the entire education, it is not easy to achieve consistent steps and obtain practical effectiveness without detailed regulations and effective implementation. Based on the actual situation and the minimum needs in fact, the following measures are proposed:</p>
<p>(1) Organization: a. Secondary schools and primary schools above the sixth grade should uniformly set up social education promotion committees to be responsible for designing and implementing social education matters in each school in order to achieve specific responsibilities. b. Each county, city, and autonomous region should gather people in charge of public education and Baojia personnel at all levels to organize social education promotion committees and set up a chief secretary to preside over social education matters in schools at all levels within the jurisdiction in order to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>(2) Training: a. The Ministry of Education will provide training to the people in charge of the social education promotion committees of secondary schools and above and other personnel who serve as the mainstays of concurrent social education in order to improve work efficiency. b. The competent education authorities of each province, city, and county should use holidays to convene and hold training sessions for the chief secretaries of the social education promotion committees of each county, city, and autonomous region and the personnel in charge of social education in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>(3) Work: a. In addition to teachers and staff being the main body of education in schools below the junior high school level, all teachers and students in schools above the junior high school level should be mobilized, and student service performance should account for an important part of moral conduct grades in order to strengthen their belief in service in the rear. b. Colleges and universities should each conduct two or more types of more specialized social education work based on their expertise and should delineate areas near the school to run social education implementation areas and implement civic education, livelihood education, and family education. c. Primary and secondary schools should conduct two or more types of social education work in accordance with the "Measures for Schools at All Levels to Concurrently Run Social Education" promulgated by the Ministry of Education (such as popular lectures, wall newspapers, public art life guidance, achievement exhibitions, etc.) and should run public schools and family education classes.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Investigates the Service Situation of Normal School Students</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Communication) The Ministry of Education believes that normal school graduates from national secondary schools have all been assigned to serve in accordance with the normal school student service regulations. However, the Ministry of Education has not yet fully understood the service situation of normal school students in various provinces after graduation. Therefore, in late last month, it instructed the education departments of various provinces to issue a ministerial order to report on the service locations assigned to normal school graduates in various provinces. The items are very detailed, and each department is required to fill out and report quickly without delay in order to collect and organize them for review.</p>
<h3>Education Briefs</h3>
<p>Relief Center for Out-of-School Children: Ten compulsory primary schools have been added, and the city has been divided into twenty districts. Teachers and staff are being recruited, with slight stipends. Anyone interested can go to the center at 519 Edward Road, Pudong Fellow Association, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day to pick up an application form for registration.</p>
<p>Shanghai Drama School is scheduled to open on the 10th of this month, with formal classes starting on the 15th.</p>
<p>New Forest Primary School at 209 Shandong Road provides relief to poor out-of-school children. Tuition is only three yuan per semester for senior students. Starting today, four new elementary classes will be added, with a fee of only one yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Tung Wah Football Club created an amazing feat. In the First Division match at Yiyuan, they defeated the British Army Tung Sze Lai, which is like a leader of Western teams, by a score of 3-2. In the first half, Tung Wah was behind 1-2, but in the second half, they scored two consecutive goals, reversing the defeat into victory. Tung Wah has been in decline recently. Although they got the help of Luo Douwen yesterday, Dai Linjing suddenly missed the game due to illness, and everyone was worried about Tung Wah. But as a result, the British army suffered Waterloo. Nearly a thousand fans were happy. Tung Sze Lai will be transferred to Tianjin immediately, and from then on, a strong team will leave Shanghai. Its tragic end is also unexpected before leaving, and the hope of winning the championship has become more intense. Qin Bi Gao, the goalkeeper, repeatedly saved dangerous balls yesterday, and his contribution was the greatest. Wan Jin scored two goals alone, which is a great achievement. Luo Douwen was originally good at the left wing, but he seemed less active when he was changed to center forward, but the performance was very stable. Jia Youliang was unusually aggressive, and even the veteran Hai Liesen could not thwart his edge.</p>

<p>Tung Wah attacked first, and the momentum was very strong. The British army counterattacked. Paier hooked in from the baseline. Hongguang blocked the interception and missed. Bi Gao tended to the left, and Jinse Lai pushed into the empty goal from three yards away. It was only five minutes after the start of the game. From then on, the British army's arrogance was high. Paier was particularly active. Fortunately, Bi Gao was agile and turned danger into safety. After 36 minutes, Hongguang accidentally kissed the ball with his hand. Dan Nisi took a free kick a foot away from the penalty area and swept it across the goal. The ball was high and fast and went straight into the corner of the net. Tung Wah lost two cities in a row. Five minutes later, Shengmiao passed to Cuixing, Cuixing picked forward, Wan Jin entered the technique, and shot from ten yards away, Tung Wah regained a city. Not long after, Youliang sent in. Gelongbo turned into a corner kick. Dianhua opened it, and Donghua's forward fouled and was penalized with a free kick. The ball was not kicked out of the penalty area. Youliang rushed up and kicked it in. The verdict was invalid. The first half ended, 1-2 Tung Wah was slightly frustrated.</p>
<p>Establishing a Victory</p>
<p>When the second battle started, Luo Douwen and Wan Jin exchanged positions. In less than two minutes, Youliang rushed in from the right and tried a wonderful shot. Gelongbo jumped up to save, and Wan Jin stood up and crashed into it, rushing into the net with the ball and people (2-2). When the tie was reached, the entire Tung Wah army was inspired, and the situation of the generals improved. After 35 minutes, Aosiding handled the ball in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was executed by Luo Douwen. The head of the famous general is extraordinary, and the victory was established. After that, Tung Wah attacked fiercely, but the effect was not seen. Jianhua defeated Jianse Lai 3-2.</p>

<h3>Today It Is Difficult to Eat Oil, Rice, Flour, and Wheat Are Very Expensive Is There Any Theory of Heaven</h3>
<p>What people cannot do without for a day is firewood, rice, oil, and salt. In Shanghai people's lives, firewood is also important, but it only costs 1.8 yuan. Before the war, 1 yuan could buy ten buckets of the most common fuel, briquettes. Recently, due to competition from new factories, it once fell, but the day before yesterday it rose again and again, 70 yuan a ton, 3.8 yuan a load. Salt is filled with private salt, which is still considered cheap. Rice is unimaginable. They collude with each other. The hoarders are pushing up the price, and it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. No matter what people in the society criticize, they cannot move a single hair. The price has been rising frequently these days. Yesterday, the normal Ding Geng actually opened at 41 yuan, and Kunshan Geng rice was also above 39 yuan. The source is like this in the new Wang period. If there are no villains transporting from it, and no profiteers taking advantage of the fire to rob, the market price will never be so bad. What is suffering is the plight of Shanghai people, and no one is paying attention to it. Therefore, the courage to manipulate is getting bigger and bigger. Oil prices are manipulated more violently. Since Germany started the war, the supplement of domestic food has been to purchase soybeans in the three northeastern provinces in large quantities, and to order one million tons from Japan, which are transported to Germany by the Siberian Railway. Soybeans can be used as food and can be made into oil, and can also be used to make margarine, and gasoline (搿司林) can be extracted from the oil. Therefore, Japanese merchants are stirring up soybean oil in large quantities, and Shanghai oil merchants are stepping up hoarding. Yesterday, Qingdao soybean oil actually broke the 100 yuan mark. The market for flour and wheat will rise again tomorrow. Seeing this situation, the lives of ordinary people in Shanghai will have the feeling of "life is so difficult, is there any theory of heaven". Please see the details below.</p>
<p>The market for Dumi is still in the hands of the devil because the source is not prosperous. Therefore, the hoarders are using their tricks, rising and falling every day. It has become commonplace. The reason why hoarders dare to manipulate is (1) to use the fact that supply is needed and demand is strong, (2) to use the unstable hearts of people in the sound of expensive things, and (3) to rely on Ling Rong　as their backing. One principal can have three side effects. Yesterday, it seemed that there were few boats arriving at the river. Wheel buns were loaded with 145 cars from Su Tong Kun Tai, etc. The initial sales market was still limited, but the rise in foreign exchange and gold actually stirred people's hearts. The interest of the visitors rose again. Whenever one is mobilized, they will grab each other, fearing to fall behind. The shout of the visitors will be high, and the market price will see a new high price. Changding Geng once shouted over 43 yuan, and the closing price was 41 yuan. Changzhou Geng rice also knocked on the 40 yuan mark, opening at 39 yuan. As a result, thick Geng, thin rice, Luyang lost and other goods all rose by 1.5 yuan to 1 yuan. The total turnover was about 156,000 packs.</p>
<p>The arrival of Keqian is gradually surging. Two or three thousand packs of whole batches have gradually arrived in the Jiangbei area. Various places in Jingwu have also arrived one after another, and a large amount of foreign rice has been scheduled to arrive. The market seems to be gradually leveling off, but at the time of rising prices, the hearts of people inside and outside the industry are unanimously upward. In addition to the increase of guests as shops, the hoarders are even more greedy. With the shrinking of gold and the rise of foreign rice, Keqian has been raised by one yuan. Each Jiangbei Jingwu Xian has risen to about 36 yuan, and more than 3,000 packs have been sold.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is coming one after another. In addition to the transfer from Hong Kong, Saigon has also come to Shanghai one after another. However, with the rise of gold and the shrinking of foreign exchange, the later schedule will be more expensive. Annam Geng has reached a maximum of 36.5 yuan, and Saigon has also reached about 36 yuan. However, there were another 2,000 tons of new transactions yesterday, including 500 tons of Jianyuan No. 1, priced at 41.2 yuan, and 1,500 tons of Dafu, priced at 39.7 yuan for No. 2 and 38.2 yuan for Nos. 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The price of flour rose steadily yesterday. After the callback rose to 7 yuan, the factory goods have crossed the 8 yuan mark. This is because the gold market is rising, foreign exchange is shrinking, and the price of wheat raw materials has soared to a peak of 13 yuan. Therefore, people's hearts are rising day by day, and sellers insist on it. In order to maintain their own streets, factories still supply retail at the original price of 7.8 yuan, and customer sales have been stopped. It is reported that the recycled goods such as Cannon Cart and Pi have been raised to 8.23 yuan. The miscellaneous brand powder in the mainland is also welcomed by the local customers, and the price has also reached 7.34 yuan. The market environment is quite good, and the factory disk of 8 yuan at the beginning of next week will definitely be realized.</p>
<p>The trend of wheat is soaring. It is reported that a small number of goods arriving in Suchang were hoarded by guest hoarders and unwilling to sell. The intake of each factory is very good, and they still intend to choose skillfully. However, the market has long been stimulated by the environment. It is reported that the market traded ten cars of Suchang wheat yesterday, and the price has set a new peak of 13 yuan. It is also reported that the factory has also accepted the price of 13 yuan, but it has not yet been officially agreed. The market will open up at the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>The source of soybean oil is still gradually arriving in the form of baskets of oil, but it is difficult to relieve people's panic for a while. Although iron barrels of oil are available, the shocking price yesterday was unprecedented. Yesterday, Qingdao oil reached 103 yuan, and the market price of other oils increased by 78 yuan compared to the previous market. According to the opening, 15 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at 103 yuan, 100 pieces of Yanqi oil were priced at 80 yuan, 100 loads of this factory's oil were priced at 83 yuan, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil road goods were priced at 77 yuan, and 200 pieces of Qingqi oil road goods were priced at 78 yuan.</p>
<p>Peanut oil is transferred according to soybean oil, so the market continues to follow the increase of 3 yuan. It is estimated that 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were sold for 75 yuan, 70 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil were sold for 96 yuan, and 50 barrels of Tianjin barrel oil were sold for 97 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance Cotton, Wheat, and Foreign Exchange Result in Huge Payments; Market Momentum Tightens for Six Consecutive Days; Futures Also See Active Closing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for British and American exchange was due to Saturday being only a half-day of trading, which further intensified the upward trend, already sustained for six days. Yesterday's unofficial market was softer than HSBC's listed rates. This was likely due to the prevalence of rumors in the market in recent days, causing anxiety. Speculators revived old tricks, fueling the situation. Furthermore, other operators followed suit, and importers closed accounts for cotton and wheat. On the other hand, banks wanting to sell often bargained for higher prices, naturally creating an imbalance in supply and demand. The future remains difficult to predict. The day's process began with the American and British exchange rates rebounding to 1.875 points, then tightening to 0.03125, with prices at 4 shillings 6.6875, and 7 yuan 6.625. Subsequently, Chinese merchants and foreign firms actively bought in, and many payments for foreign wheat were made. Cotton yarn dealers also aggressively sought to buy. It was reported that Japanese firms Tohto Menka and Fukuya Yoko both entered the market to buy. Coupled with the willingness of Chinese banks and HSBC to absorb, the market briefly stabilized midway. However, by noon, the price had tightened to 4 shillings 4.4375 and 7 yuan 1.1875. By the afternoon close, British gold was still at 4 shillings 4.46875, and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 2.25, tighter by 0.25 for British gold and softer by 0.34375 for American exchange compared to the previous day. As for the futures market, it was slightly more in line with the spot market, with no significant differences in the overall situation.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Show Weak Willingness to Sell</p>
<p>In the morning, London broads were flat for both near and far terms, New York silver prices remained low, and London raw gold remained stable. Exchange rates for British versus American and versus French currencies remained stable. British versus Shanghai weakened by 0.0625, American versus British rebounded by 1.875 points, American versus Shanghai weakened slightly by 0.20, and American versus French strengthened significantly by 0.875. Central Bank listed rates for all currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 4 shillings 6.6875 for British gold and 7 yuan 6.625 for the American exchange rate, tighter by 0.03125 for British gold and harder by 0.03125 for American exchange compared to the previous close, due to the rebound in exchange rates. After opening, Chinese merchants were the first to buy in, and Chinese firms, foreign firms, and Japanese firms also competed to buy and close accounts, so the market immediately showed a softening trend. British gold went from 4 shillings 6.625 to 5.5625, and the American exchange rate went from 7 yuan 5.5625 to 4.4375. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged, and there were no increases or decreases announced for the silver equalization tax. There was a slight stabilization at one point, but the buying spree soon resumed. A certain flour mill also entered the market to buy and close accounts, and cotton yarn dealers, along with Japanese firms Tohto Menka and Fukuya Yoko, also competed to buy. At the same time, Chinese banks in Shanghai and Japanese banks aggressively bought futures. In addition, foreign banks were still reluctant to supply, and it was rumored that HSBC was also absorbing, so the market gradually tightened further. By noon, British gold was only 4 shillings 4.4375, and the American exchange rate was only 7 yuan 1.1875, with a small number of transactions reported. The afternoon close was slightly more stable, with banks' spot selling prices at 4 shillings 4.46875 for British gold and 7 yuan 2.25 for the American exchange rate. December British gold was at 4 shillings 4.4375, and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 1.1875. As a result, spot British gold was tighter by 0.15 and spot American exchange was softer by 0.34375 compared to the previous day. Futures British gold was higher by 2.234375 and American exchange weakened by 0.03125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Shanghai Exchange Rates Surge Again</p>
<p>A Hong Kong dispatch on the 2nd reports that the exchange market opened flat this morning. Both spot and futures rates for British exchange remained unchanged, opening at 1 shilling 2 pence 9.96875. Spot American exchange weakened by 0.125, to 24 yuan 3.3125. Spot Shanghai exchange weakened by 0.50 yuan, to 316 yuan for 23 yuan. Spot Japanese exchange also weakened by 0.50 yuan, to 103.50 yuan.

There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rate Retightens</p>

<h3>Large Amount of Hong Kong Dollars Used to Purchase Gold; High Reaches 4,200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold bullion unofficial market saw prices soar daily. It was reported that the confirmed amount of Hong Kong telegraphic transfers used to purchase gold the previous night reached as much as one million Hong Kong dollars. The foreign exchange trend continued to tighten, boosting market sentiment. The market jumped by 105 yuan at the opening, to 4,150 yuan. Later, many profit-taking parties, such as silver shops and gold firms, sold at prices above 4,100 yuan, causing the price to fall back to 4,110 yuan twice. Soon after, money exchange firms, securities firms, and a certain gold firm entered the market to aggressively buy, reportedly on behalf of Hong Kong interests. The price then rose again to 4,170 yuan. However, a certain money exchange firm suddenly offered to sell on behalf of Hong Kong interests, causing retail investors to follow suit and dump, pushing the price down by 40 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange market remained weak, and a certain money exchange firm aggressively bought on behalf of its client, pushing the price back up, reaching the day's high of 4,200 yuan. Subsequently, sellers who had set limit orders came into the market, and securities firms, silver shops, and many retail investors sold heavily due to today's holiday, providing an opportunity for Hong Kong interests to buy. By the close, the price had fallen slightly by 35 yuan, to 4,165 yuan, a sharp increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous day. The off-market trend remained positive in the afternoon, with continued buying interest, and the price was above 4,170 yuan. Trading remained brisk in the half-day, with approximately 2,000 taels traded. Silver shop ornaments also closed at a price 10 yuan higher. Customs gold and other types remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Bullion Rises Again by Hundreds of Yuan</p>
<p>Starting in the morning, each bar (ten taels) continued the upward momentum from the previous two days. The report that Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were used to purchase gold, reportedly amounting to a million Hong Kong dollars, intensified the bullish sentiment among buyers. When the exchange market opened weaker, market sentiment immediately surged, and buying orders boomed. Bullish parties seized the opportunity to aggressively raise prices. The opening price jumped by as much as 105 yuan by 9:30 AM. A money exchange firm sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 4,150 yuan. Shortly after, a certain gold firm suddenly pressed prices to sell, and retail investors also dumped at prices above 4,100 yuan, causing an immediate drop of 40 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 10 taels to a securities firm for 4,110 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange firm resumed buying on behalf of Hong Kong interests, pushing the price up again by 30 yuan. A certain money exchange firm entered into a deal with a fellow firm for 20 taels, at 4,140 yuan. Later, silver shops and retail investors frequently sold, and Hong Kong interests had ceased buying, causing a fall of 30 yuan, returning to a low of 4,110 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange firms and gold firms again bought on behalf of Hong Kong interests, and securities firms also absorbed. As the exchange market continued to report weakness, the price soared by 60 yuan. A line exchange firm traded 30 taels with a gold firm, for 4,170 yuan. A certain money exchange firm, which had been buying on behalf of Hong Kong interests, suddenly offered to sell, amounting to approximately 200 taels, causing retail investors to follow suit and sell, immediately pushing the price back down by 40 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 20 taels to a leading firm for 4,130 yuan. After 11:30 AM, another money exchange firm aggressively bought on behalf of local interests. Given the tight exchange market trend, sellers disappeared, causing the price to rise rapidly. Soon after, it jumped by 70 yuan. A money exchange firm bought 10 taels from a silver shop, for 4,200 yuan. The influx of limit sell orders at 4,200 yuan halted the rising momentum. Subsequently, a certain silver shop affiliated with a securities firm, and many retail investors competed to sell. Hong Kong interests took the opportunity to bargain and absorb, and the price quickly fell back by 35 yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm for 4,165 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. After the close, the price continued to fall to 4,150 yuan, but it soon rose again to 4,165 yuan. Saturday afternoon was a market holiday. The result, compared to the previous day, was a surge of 120 yuan. In the preceding three days, the price had risen quickly, totaling 299 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 90 yuan in the half-day. The selling price of cash shop brand gold was 10 yuan higher than that of gold bullion, while the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Listed at 420 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of silver shop ornaments was 410 yuan per tael, maintained by the major firms. At 9:40 AM, the price was raised by 10 yuan. At 11:15 AM, it was raised by another 5 yuan. At noon, it fell back by 5 yuan. There were no further changes after that. The major firms ultimately changed the listed price to 420 yuan. The new firms had the same price as the major firms. The buying price was 15-20 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply; US Dollar Draft Reaches 13.85 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, increased, and market prices rose further. Customers eagerly sought to close accounts for British and American gold drafts, causing market prices to rise sharply. The price of a US dollar draft reached 13.85 yuan. Market conditions eased slightly near noon, with the evening price at 13.67 yuan. The supply of Hong Kong drafts and French franc drafts was scarce, and market prices were firm.

Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds rise by 2.50 yuan, British gold drafts rise by 2.20 yuan, American gold pounds rise by 3.00 yuan, American gold drafts rise by 0.52 yuan, Hong Kong drafts rise by 0.07 yuan, and French franc drafts rise by 0.003 yuan. There were no changes in other currencies.</p>
<h3>Securities; Bull and Bear Forces Neutralize in Foreign Stocks; Buyers Dominate Domestic Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market was still weak. Class A and C shares broke through 7 yuan, and Class E shares also fell below 8 yuan. This was likely influenced by the sudden surge in gold bullion prices. For many days, the market has been difficult to rise or fall. Bullish forces are still strong. Based on recent trends, bearish forces may suffer previous losses. In the morning trading, Nos. 20 and 35, and Great Trade and Yuan Yu bought in. Yong Kang, Lian He, Run Li, and Yong Da Lian Yi sold out. In the afternoon, Yong Kang, Lian He, and Run Li continued to sell. Tai Feng, Da Tong, Chang Ji, and Hong Da all bought in. Observing this buying and selling lineup, the bullish parties were more bullish, and the bearish parties were more bearish, largely adhering to their consistent principles. Market prices ultimately fell by 0.10 to 0.30 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 25 shares of Qingfeng Textile Factory were traded at a price of 7 yuan each.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for shares of various guilds saw a final five-minute rush to close positions, aligning with the tightening trend in foreign exchange. This caused the prices of various shares to fall again, resulting in a large transaction volume after the bull and bear forces were neutralized. At the close, activity among buyers was not uncommon at a reasonable price level. Rubber shares were also softened by a small number of floating positions, but the impact was clearly not as great as on industrial shares.</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 1st reports that the market for Chinese Foreign Detective Police shares remained stable today. There were no changes in the official prices for upper and lower grades.</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 1st reports that the market for shares of various British-owned Far East companies was generally calm today. Only the price of Kuala Lumpur Rubber shares rose sharply by 11 pence, to 21 shillings 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton and Yarn; Domestic and Foreign Cotton Markets; Dramatic and Extraordinary Rises</h3>
<p>Common Cotton Raised to 160 Yuan; Japanese Factories Order Over 10,000 Bales of American Cotton</p>
<p>There was less domestic cotton trading than before, but the price increase was extraordinarily high. This was due to the continued rises in overseas American and Indian cotton markets, and the simultaneous shrinkage of drafts, leading to a rise in both official and unofficial prices. As a result, sentiment was extremely bullish. Most market participants holding goods were aware of the previous situation and claimed they had no goods to supply. Everyone closed their doors and refused to provide samples, resulting in reduced transactions. This situation resembled a cotton shortage. The prices quoted in the market were chaotic. The price of common cotton opened at 158 to 162 yuan in the morning, a sharp increase of 7-8 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, goods could not be obtained even at higher prices. This state of affairs was somewhat overly alarming. The source of supply from Northern Jiangsu was 2,318 bales of common cotton, and from North Sha, 1,880 bales. The situation of current cotton is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>White Bag Fire Machine 150.00 Traded Among Peers 160 Bales</p>
<p>White Bag Fire Machine 153.00 Traded Among Peers 200 Bales</p>

<p>American Cotton 167.00 Traded Among Peers 240 Bales</p>
<p>American Cotton 165.00 Traded Among Peers 160 Bales</p>
<p>American Cotton 169.00 Traded Among Peers 200 Bales</p>
<p>Another report on foreign cotton market prices stated that the New York cotton market had seen a sharp rise in recent days. The consecutive rise had lasted nearly ten days. The opening yesterday morning was also due to the buying by speculators and increased overseas demand. Spot trading was very brisk. Dispatches from Liverpool and Mumbai both reported favorable conditions, resulting in extremely excited market sentiment. Short covering was very active. As a result, closing prices were over ten pound coins higher than the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 3 rupees, Egyptian cotton rose by over 40 pound coins, and Liverpool cotton rose by over 10 pence.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, the increase in exchange rates caused a quietening of deals from Chinese factories. However, it was active for the Japanese factories. They are all making major acquisitions due to the trend of rising American cotton with the possibility of one jiao one or two points. Yesterday, over ten thousand bales were sold. The big reason for the rapid shrinkage of American exchange is the price of payments for the cotton. Here is the factory price sent to the factory after folding in the American exchange of 7 yuan 25 points.</p>
<p>20 Count American Middling 203.50</p>
<p>Also Also Grade Below 198.90</p>

<p>Also Also Grade Below 204.40</p>
<p>42 Count 203.50</p>
<p>Also Also Grade Below 206.25</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise Rapidly; Double Horse Reaches 700 Yuan Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market became firm and prices rose dramatically. This was due to the continued advances in overseas European and American cotton markets, with the appearance of unlimited price increases. Meanwhile, there were reports that Japanese yarn was being transported for export and shipment to India, which also affected domestic yarn. Factory costs were also increasing daily, so speculative buying became active again. Sales have also ceased being as sluggish as in the past. Small-scale purchases by Hong Kong interests were more active. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn once reached a high of 700 yuan.</p>
<p>In the morning, peers discussed the current yarn market and the conversation quickly tightened, as the rise in Indian cotton was alarming. Buyers flocked to the market, and the situation was favorable. The opening price jumped 13 yuan, with 20-count Change Horse yarn at 690 yuan. It was soon reported that foreign exchange rates had shrunk, market sentiment revived, and market prices gradually rose, tightening another step to 700 yuan. But Guangzhou's appetite was not strong, and it fell back by 5 yuan. It was found that 2,400 bales were sold in half a day. The market prices saw a rise of 20 yuan for 20-count Double Horse yarn, 29 yuan for Double Globe yarn, and 24 yuan for Angel yarn. Today, 395 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Afternoon news: Yarn prices rose sharply again, mainly due to hoarding by merchants. Shenxin No. 2 Factory released hundreds of bales of 20-count Angel yarn at a price above 700 yuan for a three-month term.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods; Wealthy Merchants Hoard Cloth; Market Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth prices rose sharply due to the tightening exchange market. Wealthy merchants both within and outside the industry aggressively bought in, causing selling prices to soar.

<h3>Coal; Kailan Coal Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Kailan bituminous coal was previously in short supply, and demand in this street was strong, causing market inventory to be swept clean. Although new goods have recently arrived in succession, the "Manly Marler" ship brought another 5,600 tons of Kailan General Coal yesterday. The merchants and guest merchants in this street are handling them, with a tendency to sell as soon as they arrive. In addition, recent waterway freight has increased, causing the market price to rise as well. It is estimated that Kailan No. 1 Lump costs 86 yuan per ton, No. 2 Lump costs 73 yuan, Hua Shui Slag costs 73 yuan, and No. 2 Slag costs 64 yuan. These are all 2-3 yuan higher than last month's prices. The above prices are all inter-trade prices. It requires a little extra dealing delivered to the merchants.</p>

<h3>Western Shanghai Becomes a Den of Vice; Another Terrible Murder Occurs; A Bloody Human Head Found in Caojiadu; Body Also Discovered, Awaiting Examination</h3>
<p>The areas outside the boundaries of the Shanghai International Settlement, where roads were built without authorization, have become a hotbed for crime since the Japanese and puppet regimes encroached on the police powers of the settlement. Order has deteriorated daily, becoming a "bad land." Robberies in broad daylight have frequently occurred in the Caojiadu area. Shops close at 7 PM, and pedestrians disappear by 10 PM, creating a desolate scene. At around 11 PM the night before last, a bloody male head was suddenly discovered in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, creating a scene of extreme horror. The deterioration of security in Western Shanghai and the lawlessness of the gangsters are evident from this. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>A Human Head, a Terrifying Sight</p>
<p>Around 11:25 PM the night before last (the 1st), a human head was suddenly discovered in front of the Zhengxingguan noodle shop in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu. The hair was in a flat-top style, the face was pale, blood was streaming from the nostrils, and there was a gold tooth in the mouth. The eyes were tightly closed. Beside the head was a cloth resembling a scarf, stained with blood. The scene was extremely gruesome, causing onlookers to shudder. A crowd gathered immediately, and rumors spread.</p>
<p>Police Investigation Reveals Body</p>
<p>After receiving a report, the Jing'an Temple Police Station immediately dispatched multiple patrol cars and armored cars to the scene. Because only the head was found, and not the body, it was very strange. Detectives were sent to investigate the area and discovered a piece of paper on a wall corner inside the Fusheng Company gambling den, which said, "Zhang Zhidong, 34 years old, from Zhenjiang." The detectives believed the note was related to the case and immediately took it back to the police station for investigation. Then an ambulance was summoned to send the head to the morgue.</p>
<p>Disagreement over Looting Causes Conflict</p>
<p>According to an investigation by a reporter from the China News Agency, the head belonged to Wang Zhidong, nicknamed "Little Wang," who was a disciple of Xia Xijiang, nicknamed "Stinky Fish Head." Wang was a local hoodlum who made a living by extortion and theft. Because of a disagreement over looting, Wang had a falling out with his accomplices. Recently, a mole within the police station learned this, so the accomplices were arrested one by one. As a result, those guys suspected Wang of snitching, and they sought to kill Wang.</p>
<p>A Large Group of Criminals Commit Murder</p>
<p>Around 11 PM the night before last, "Little Wang" was bathing in the Laborer's Road Bathhouse. When those guys heard the news, they gathered a large group of criminals, carrying weapons, and forcibly took him out of the bathhouse. Seeing the situation was bad, Wang dared not resist. He was taken by those guys to an open space near the Yongcheng Pottery Shop behind the Xinchang Silk Factory in Sanjiaochang. They fired twelve or thirteen shots with a box cannon, killing him. Then, they dismembered the body into three parts with a sharp weapon, throwing the torso into the Suzhou Creek. They took the head to Wujiaochang and discarded it on the ground. They then scattered in all directions. The police station is currently dispatching detectives to investigate.</p>
<p>Car Speeds By, Throwing Out a Human Head</p>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that at 11 PM last night (the 1st), a car sped along Rue Cardinal Fesch. Suddenly, a gunnysack was thrown from the car, containing a bloody head. It fell to the ground and rolled out. Passersby were shocked. After a search by police officers, a body was found near the cemetery next to Avenue Haig, not far from Wujiaochang on Rue Cardinal Fesch. The head had been chopped off. The identity of the deceased has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Two Bullet Holes Were Fatal Wounds</p>
<p>The head had two bullet holes, which were the cause of death. Two shell casings were found near the body. The murdered Chinese man was in his thirties and had two gold teeth. The body was wearing a wool overcoat. According to witnesses, there were three or four people in the car from which the head was thrown. The location of the murder has not yet been discovered. It is likely that the murder site and the disposal site were not close. This is the latest crime in the "bad land" of Shanghai. The cause of the murder may be revenge between thugs. Police officers from the Shanghai Municipal Police and the Great Road Police are investigating the matter.</p>
<h3>Ample Coal Supply; 120,000 Tons Recently Arrived; Worth Over 5 Million National Currency</h3>
<p>The European war has stabilized, and the coal supply is increasing. Inventory has increased, reaching 500,000 tons city-wide. However, due to the arrival of winter, the demand for coal is high, and prices have not fallen. According to Jianghai Customs, the recent coal supply is as follows: (1) In September, total imports of coal fuel and asphalt coal tar reached 18,223 tons, worth 3,393,233 yuan in national currency, with coal blocks being the largest category, totaling 17,3502 tons, worth 3,307,491 yuan in national currency. (2) In October, total imports of coal fuel and asphalt coal tar reached 104,719 tons, worth 1,759,309 yuan in national currency, with coal being the largest category, totaling 101,957 tons, worth 1,704,035 yuan in national currency. In total, 122,942 tons of fuel were imported in September and October, worth 5,152,542 yuan in national currency. Regarding the selling price of coal briquettes, the industry association strictly enforces price limits. However, due to a slight increase in the selling price of coal dust recently, the cost has increased. Some coal briquette shops are automatically adding 0.10 to 0.20 yuan per dan for top-quality goods sold at the door.</p>
<h3>In Memoriam: Mr. Wu Guangxin, Launched by Yu Qiaqing and Others, Held at the Cypress Apartments</h3>
<p>Following the news of the passing of Mr. Wu Guangxin, a member of the Military Council of the National Government, in Hong Kong, a wave of mourning arose. Prominent figures from various circles in the city, including Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jingren, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Xu Qiufan, Yuan Ludeng, and Wu Yunzhai, initiated preparations for a memorial service.

<h3>Moving Speech by Cole at the Royal Air Force Association Meeting: British Government Urgently Needs Aviation Personnel; Those Willing to Serve Will Surely Rise Up</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the Shanghai branch of the Royal Air Force Association held a luncheon yesterday (the 1st) at its headquarters in the HSBC Building to honor Sir Archibald Kerr Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, and others. During the luncheon, the Ambassador addressed the members of the Association and other guests, first expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome. He then discussed their obligations to the country and hoped that they would all provide whatever service they could.</p>
<p>**Willing to Remain at Their Posts Awaiting Opportunity**</p>
<p>The Ambassador continued, stating that British expatriates in China could still best serve their country by remaining in their positions and awaiting the opportunity. Shortly after the outbreak of the war, I made a broadcast, advising British citizens not to rush back to their home country or hastily seek to join the trenches, but to maintain their original positions and rise up when the country needed their services. There is no reason for me to reiterate what I said before; the events that have transpired since then have confirmed the accuracy of my earlier statements.</p>
<p>**Britain Needs Aviation Personnel**</p>
<p>Since that broadcast, instructions have been sent from the British government to all consular offices in China, ordering them to record the names of all British expatriates with aviation-related skills. At this point, the Ambassador read out the full text of the instructions, which directed British consulates to record the details and names of local British expatriates with suitable qualifications to serve as aircraft pilots and wireless operators. The Ambassador continued, saying that most of those present were probably aware of these instructions. Judging from your expressions, I know that most of you believe you are qualified to apply for service. Beyond this, I regret that I cannot say more.</p>
<p>**Deep Congratulations for the Opportunity to Serve the Country**</p>
<p>This is an extraordinary war. In recent months, we have witnessed a trend in the war, namely, that victory in the air is more important than in other areas. Therefore, when the time comes to issue a call to arms, those of you with pilot qualifications will surely receive this call. I used to be an infantryman, and I doubt there will be an opportunity for me to participate in this war. You are pilots, and that is to be congratulated.</p>
<p>**Sir Victor Sassoon Responds with a Speech of Thanks**</p>
<p>After the Ambassador's speech, the members and guests sang songs together. Then, Sir Victor Sassoon, the Chairman of the Association, gave a reply, welcoming the Ambassador and briefly stating that there is no doubt that the war cannot be successfully concluded unless we exert all our efforts. Therefore, the members of the Association are prepared to depart and serve when needed, and they have already requested the British authorities here to record the names of those who have applied for service. Although they are far from the battlefield, they have not been forgotten by their country.</p>
<h3>40,000 Bags of Saigon Rice to Arrive Today; 2,500 Tons Traded Yesterday: Rice Shortage Even More Severe in Japan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries to rice industry sources revealed that local rice trading firms have jointly commissioned French merchants Davie, British merchants Buchheister &amp; Co., and the Jian Yuan Chinese Firm to negotiate Saigon rice purchases via telegram. Contracts for a total of 300,000 bags have already been concluded. It is reported that (1) 3,000 tons (30,000 bags) of Grade 1 and Grade 2 Saigon rice were traded the day before yesterday, and (2) 2,500 tons (including broken rice), or 25,000 bags, were traded yesterday at a price of 31 yuan. 40,000 bags are being loaded onto the French Postal Shipping Company's "Dumont d'Urville" and are expected to arrive in port today. It is also understood that Japan's annual rice needs are largely met by imports from Saigon. Now that Saigon has also refused to trade with Japan, the Japanese are unable to obtain supplies indirectly from the occupied areas, indicating that Japan's rice shortage is even more severe than Shanghai's.</p>
<h3>British Garrison's East Surrey Regiment Transferred to North China; West Yorkshire Regiment Has Already Arrived in Shanghai: Troop Rotation is Purely Routine</h3>
<p>On the 13th of last month, the British War Office announced that the British government had decided to withdraw British troops from North China, leaving only a few necessary units to protect the safety and assets of British citizens. Yesterday, according to Tianjin sources, a company of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry, a British unit stationed in Tianjin, was scheduled to take a train to Qinhuangdao on the evening of the 4th, and wait to embark on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Kia-sang" Steamer, but the date of departure and destination were not announced.</p>
<p>**Tianjin Garrison Transferred to Hong Kong; Shanghai Garrison Troops Transferred to Tianjin**</p>
<p>It is understood that the Tianjin British troops will be transferred to Hong Kong, which is the first step in the complete withdrawal of the entire King's Shropshire Light Infantry Regiment. After the Tianjin British troops are withdrawn, it was previously reported that a portion of the Shanghai British troops would be transferred to take over the defense. Yesterday, this was also confirmed by reliable sources.</p>
<p>**Shanghai British Garrison Augmented by Over 100 Men**</p>
<p>However, this move does not constitute an actual reduction of the Shanghai British Garrison. Although a company of the East Surrey Regiment of the British garrison in Shanghai had already returned to North China on the "Daisheng" Steamer yesterday and arrived on the evening of the 5th to relieve the departing King's Shropshire Light Infantry Regiment, the "Daisheng" Steamer, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 1st, had carried 120 men of the West Yorkshire Regiment to Shanghai to take over the defense. According to sources within the British military authorities, this troop rotation is purely a routine procedure. Even if the European war had not occurred, troop movements would still be necessary during the regular rotation period.</p>
<p>**French Garrison Reinforcements in Shanghai Recalled**</p>
<p>When Britain announced the withdrawal of troops from Tianjin last time, France also followed suit with a similar announcement. Yesterday, according to Tianjin news, after the withdrawal of the British King's Shropshire Light Infantry Regiment, the Tianjin French troops will also withdraw to Annam (French Indochina) soon. As for the French garrison in Shanghai, a unit of 800 men had already withdrawn to Annam on the 25th of last month. As a result, the French garrison in Shanghai has reverted to the situation before the "August 13th Incident" in 1937. At that time, the French garrison numbered 1,200 men, including infantry, artillery, and a tank squadron, and was called the "Mixed Battalion." When the Shanghai war suddenly broke out, France drew soldiers from various battalions in Annam, formed two mixed battalions, and sent them to reinforce the French Concession in Shanghai, calling them the "China Expeditionary Force." Until last year, the number of returning soldiers in the standing garrison and reinforcement units had gradually decreased. The most recent standing "Mixed Battalion" was supplemented by soldiers drawn from the reinforced "China Expeditionary Force." Thus, the quotas of the two reinforced units were further reduced. Those who were dispatched to Annam this time were all reinforcement troops, in other words, all the reinforcement troops were recalled, restoring the garrison situation before the August 13th Incident.</p>

<h3>Gaoqiao Puppet Army "Battalion Commander" Xu Maifei Shot Dead; Previously Escaped Assassination; Killed Instantly by Bullet to Vital Spot</h3>
<p>Xu Zhifei, the puppet "Battalion Commander" under Qin Xingyan, the puppet "Regimental Commander" of the "Self-Defense Corps" in the Gaoqiao district of Pudong, had more than 200 puppet "soldiers" under his command, stationed at the puppet "Battalion Headquarters" in Gao Hang Town on the border of Shangchuan. Xu's movements were heavily guarded, always with four puppet "soldiers" protecting him to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>**A Month Ago**</p>
<p>Two people waited for Xu's return from Shanghai to Gao, ambushing him on the road from Donggou to Gao Hang, hoping to assassinate Xu. However, the plot was discovered, and they were captured by Xu's personal protection puppet "soldiers" and taken to the puppet "District Team Headquarters" at Xijialukou in Chuansha, where they were executed. Afterwards, Xu became more careful about traveling. However, three days ago, when Xu was traveling from Gao Hang to the Gaoqiao puppet "Self-Defense Corps Headquarters" to meet with the puppet "Regimental Commander" Qin Xingyan, just as he arrived at the</p>
<p>**Gaoqiao Highway**</p>
<p>Several people suddenly jumped out from the roadside, catching Xu and his party off guard. After disarming the puppet "guards," they opened fire on Xu several times, hitting vital spots. He collapsed on the spot in a pool of blood and died. The perpetrators, having achieved their objective, calmly escaped with the four Mauser pistols seized from the puppet "guards".</p>
<p>**Calmly Escaped**</p>
<p>By the time the puppet "Self-Defense Corps Headquarters" received the report and pursued them, they were long gone. According to reports, when the war shifted west, Xu Zhifei once claimed to be a guerrilla fighter. He then surrendered to Hattori Kazuyoshi, the Japanese advisor in Gaoqiao Town, and became a member of the puppet "Self-Defense Corps."</p>
<h3>Workers at Xiangtai Sawmill Request Improved Treatment, Proposing Wage Increase and Other Conditions; Factory Agrees to Collective Discussion</h3>
<p>The Dazhong News Agency reports that the British-owned Xiangtai Sawmill on Yangshupu Bridge in Shanghai is a large-scale operation with approximately 600 workers. Recently, due to the factory's reduction of working days for workers, the workers' livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. After collective discussions among all workers, five conditions were proposed to the factory, requesting a response from the management. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>**Content of the Conditions**</p>
<p>After a meeting and collective discussion on the evening of the 28th of last month, all the factory workers submitted five conditions to the management on the 30th through their representatives: (1) Increase wages, the method being that the management should increase workers' wages by one jiao per day starting from the first month of each year; (2) Provide pensions, the method being that workers who have worked in the factory for one year should be paid one month's salary as a pension, those who have worked for two years should be paid two months' salary, and so on; (3) If the factory orders workers to work only three days per week, wages should still be calculated based on six days; (4) If workers contract illnesses or die due to their work, the factory should provide medical expenses and compensation; (5) Wages for holidays and memorial days should be paid as usual.</p>
<p>**Management's Response**</p>
<p>After receiving the conditions proposed by the workers' representatives, the management replied to the workers' representatives that it could only accept the second condition regarding pensions, but the method would be changed so that the workers' years of service would be calculated from the current year. The other conditions could not be accepted at all. At that time, when all the factory workers heard this news, they were in a state of panic, and the so-called "Workers' Welfare Association," which was instigated and organized by the puppet "Great People's Association," took the opportunity to agitate, attempting to entice the factory workers to join the association and confront the management. However, most of the workers deeply understood the importance of the situation and did not take this action. The management also advised the workers that if they wanted to hold a meeting, they could do so in the factory's open space to avoid being exploited. Therefore, all the factory workers have decided to hold a collective discussion in the factory's open space yesterday morning.</p>
<p>**Business Conditions**</p>
<p>The factory is very large, with branches in Tianjin, Nanjing, Qingdao, Hong Kong, and Xiamen. Its raw materials are partly sourced from Fujian, the three northeastern provinces, and domestically. Its business has always been prosperous. However, since the outbreak of the "August 13th" war, all branches except those in Shanghai and Hong Kong have been closed. The products made by the Shanghai headquarters are mostly materials needed for Hong Kong cigarette boxes, egg boxes, and buildings.</p>
<h3>Night Shift Workers at Lun Chang New Factory to Resume Work on Monday</h3>
<p>After the resolution of the labor dispute at the British-owned Lun Chang Textile Factory's new factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, its day shift workers resumed work at the factory on the 27th of last month. More than a thousand night shift workers are also scheduled to enter the factory this morning (Monday), while the day shift workers who resumed work last week will rotate to the night shift and enter the factory at 6 pm tonight. When the workers at the old factory in Bailianjing resumed work, a new dispute arose briefly, with some people attempting to obstruct the resumption of work again in order to obtain more favorable conditions. However, because all the workers deeply understood the importance of the situation and expressed their aversion to the strike, the majority have been working as usual for several days, proving that those who were disrupting the resumption of work have failed.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Sends Letter to Chamber of Commerce to Stop Hoarding Auxiliary Currency Notes; Exchange of Corner Notes Limited to 50 Yuan; Can Be Linked to the Issuance of New Cent Notes</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of auxiliary currency notes in the city, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, requesting a measured increase in issuance. Now, a reply has been received from the Central Bank, stating that it has received your letter No. Pu Zi 8693, stating that recently the city's auxiliary currency notes are extremely scarce, making it inconvenient to purchase small items, and that it is necessary to find a way to regulate the situation to facilitate circulation, etc. It has been found that the bank's auxiliary currency notes have been exchanged in large quantities in recent months, and it does not seem that there is a shortage in the market. Since there is a sudden shortage, it may be due to excessive inflow into the interior or that some people are taking the opportunity to hoard in order to profit. This kind of behavior has a great impact on people's daily lives and should be stopped by your chamber. In addition to the insufficient application of auxiliary currency notes, the situation has been reported to the head office for approval and decision. Corresponding reply, I hope you will check it out.</p>
<p>**Jiao Coins from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Other Provinces Have Been Exchanged**</p>
<p>After the panic over jiao coins in Shanghai, those generally responsible for regulating the economy have tried various methods. Therefore, banks such as the Central Agricultural Bank, the Jiangsu Provincial Bank, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank have exchanged all their stored one-jiao, two-jiao, two-jiao five-fen, and five-jiao corner coins as much as possible to facilitate circulation in the market and reduce the suffering of ordinary people and small businesses, which has been very beneficial. Since its implementation, companies and firms have gone to these banks to exchange coins from morning to night. Until the day before yesterday, banks such as the Central Agricultural Bank, the Jiangsu Provincial Bank, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank had completely exchanged their stored corner coins.</p>
<p>**Restrictions Reimposed on Exchanges at the Central Agricultural Bank**</p>
<p>The Central Agricultural Bank is still exchanging coins at the Central Bank on Avenue Edward VII (now Yan'an East Road). However, since the goal of the entire city is to gather at the Central Agricultural Bank after the Jiangsu Provincial Bank and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank stopped exchanging coins, the exchangers are even more crowded. It has been heard that the bank has decided to reimpose regulations starting yesterday, limiting exchanges of corner coins to 50 yuan per person, because unlimited exchanges still lead to hoarding and speculation. It is said that the exchange will continue until all the coins are exchanged, and it is hoped that it can be linked to the new cent notes issued by the Central Bank on the 8th, so that there will be no more panic in the market.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding Commercial Ethics: Special Broadcast on the Second Day of the Moral Re-Armament Movement</h3>
<p>Since the decline of ethics in the business community in the past, the general businessmen have been selfish, self-serving, and engaged in infighting, using fraudulent and intimidating means to seek the interests of one person or one's own, and eventually causing friction and disputes. The parties involved have used business as an excuse, recognizing this as their duty, resulting in the increasing bankruptcy of commercial ethics. In view of this, the city's Moral Re-Armament Movement held a special broadcast yesterday, in which people from various professions in the city, including businessmen, doctors, lawyers, and foreign firm employees, each discussed the importance of rebuilding commercial ethics based on their own experiences of reforming their morals and changing their environment. The words were extremely cautionary and can serve as a guide for people in the professional world today.</p>
<p>**Personal Morality More Important Than Money**</p>
<p>The broadcasters all said that people in the professional world must not use business as an excuse and neglect personal morality, and must take honesty, purity, selflessness, and love as the standards of life, discover personal sins and shortcomings, repent and reform, remove the bad habits of greed, hatred, deception, and selfishness, and practice a life of God's management. By practicing what we preach, we can move others with our new lives and change the environment. Then, moral re-armament will be based on this, and a new society and a new world will be established.</p>
<p>**The British King's Uncle Broadcast Yesterday**</p>
<p>Also, yesterday at 2 pm and this morning at 2 am, the Earl of Athlone, the uncle of the British King, broadcast for the Moral Re-Armament Movement in London (London time was 6 am and 6 pm yesterday). The Earl had co-signed a letter to the editor of "The Times" with other London celebrities on November 12 last year.</p>
<p>**The Relationship Between National Strength and Morality**</p>
<p>Stating that the strength of a nation must be judged by whether it is able to recognize its own mistakes, and that the glory of a nation depends on whether it is able to take responsibility for building a new world. Therefore, we not only need a God-inspired political morality, but also need to be governed by God daily, in every place and at every time. We must teach ourselves to live according to the principles of honesty, purity, selflessness, and love, and to fulfill God's will in our personal and public lives. Moral Re-Armament is the foundation of this kind of life, and we cannot but devote ourselves to it.</p>
<p>**Two More Broadcasts to Conclude Today**</p>
<p>Today is the last day of the special broadcast for the movement. In addition to broadcasting at the original scheduled time on the Oriental Radio Station, the speeches on moral re-armament by Dr. Frank Buchman, the founder of the movement, and the American tennis star Austin, etc., will be broadcast at XMHA Radio Station from 6 pm to 6:30 pm. People from all walks of life should listen on time.</p>
<h3>Regular Sailings to Ningbo by Foreign Ships</h3>

<h3>Moral Re-Armament in China (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Since the Moral Re-Armament Movement originated in Europe, it has been only a little over a year, but its bright and brilliant light has already shone on every corner of the earth. Its impact has not only reached heads of state, scholars, and the masses, but also the semi-civilized natives of South Africa, who have also benefited deeply. People from all walks of life in various countries have praised and admired it in unison, and have joined this new movement that bears the mission of the times. Standing under the banner of the Moral Re-Armament Movement, the masses are marching forward with full enthusiasm towards the goal.</p>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling, the highest leaders of our country, have given their strong support to the Moral Re-Armament Movement. Their speeches on this matter in recent years have aroused enthusiastic welcome and attention from people all over the world. At the first and second world conferences, they both sent special telegrams of greetings, recognizing this movement as an effective remedy for the current chaotic and corrupt situation. That is, to thoroughly eradicate the roots of greed, selfishness, cowardice, and hatred. This is the initial step in solving any evil in the world.</p>
<p>What is the Moral Re-Armament Movement? What is its mission? The Moral Re-Armament Movement provides individuals with a practical program—sincerity, righteous intention, self-cultivation, family harmony, national governance, and world peace. It has no partisan, ethnic, or class boundaries. It is formed by a group of enlightened comrades who are united in spirit and abide by the four major principles in their daily lives—honesty, selflessness, purity, and love. To improve the individual, transform the country, and create a new world.</p>
<p>Our country's response to the Moral Re-Armament Movement was earlier than that of other countries. The reason for this is that the Moral Re-Armament Movement meets our country's needs. The people are the foundation of the country, and when the foundation is solid, the country will be stable. At this critical moment of survival, the Moral Re-Armament Movement, with its aim to cleanse the heart and reform behavior, is the only essential plan to save the nation and ensure its survival.</p>
<p>The Moral Re-Armament Movement is distributed in all parts of our country, east, west, north, and south. Its scope of activity is the entire society. Schools, churches, public organizations, government employees, businessmen, etc., have all joined the movement one after another.</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai newspapers published a message from the Ministry of Finance, stating that a certain Ms. Hua in Western China, influenced by the Moral Re-Armament Movement, repaid the National Government the full amount of customs duties that had been leaked.</p>

<h3>Two Children Kidnapped on Jing'an Temple Road and Park Road; Along with a Maid, They Were Abducted by Three Bandits</h3>
<p>A kidnapping case occurred in front of the Shanghai YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road and Park Road in the Public Concession at around 3:10 pm yesterday. At that time, two children, accompanied by a maid and a wet nurse, were watching the Saturday (yesterday) horse races at the Shanghai Race Club in the vicinity. Suddenly, a car carrying three men in long robes drove from the west, stopped near the area. The three men immediately got out of the car, and one of them</p>
<p>**Pulled Out a Gun**</p>
<p>And threatened the maid and others, not allowing them to make a sound. At the same time, two bandits each held one of the young children and, together with the wet nurse, jumped into the original car and sped off east. By the time the other maid called for help, it was too late. She hurried back to the owner's residence to report the incident, and then reported it to the police, requesting an investigation. After receiving the report, the police immediately ordered detectives to conduct a thorough investigation, but there was still no news as of late last night. According to an investigation by reporters, the two kidnapped children are the sons of the managers of the Chongqing Bank and the Sichuan Bank, located in the Wuzhou Building at the intersection of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road in this city.</p>
<p>**Sons of Managers**</p>
<p>One is only three years old, and the other is only one year old, an infant still in swaddling clothes. Their residence is located at No. 24, Lane 61 (Tianlefang), Xieqiao Lane. Yesterday afternoon, the wet nurse of the infant suddenly proposed to go to watch the horse races. With the owner's consent, they went out, but unexpectedly encountered a kidnapping. At the same time, when the two children were kidnapped, the wet nurse's demeanor was unusual. Therefore, in the occurrence of this case, it is feared that the wet nurse cannot escape responsibility. At present, the police are conducting a thorough search based on various clues.</p>

<h3>Robbery of the Wulin Steamer - Passengers' Cargo Undisturbed - British Ship "Moth" Escorted Vessel to Shanghai - One Pirate Killed, Rest Fled</h3>
<p>The British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire's Wulin steamer, sailing from Haimen, Jiangbei, to Shanghai one morning, was attacked by over fifty pirates while loading cotton at Sanhe Port, Qidong County. The pirates, traveling in small boats, boarded the ship armed. According to Butterfield &amp; Swire, the pirates attempted to seize the cotton being loaded and also sought to rob the ship's valuables. As the pirates boarded, they first stormed into the first-class cabin. The Russian security officer of the ship, seeing the pirates swarm aboard, opened fire. The pirates returned fire, creating a barrage of shots as dense as a string of beads, numbering over a hundred. Passengers and crew members rushed to the cabins for cover, causing considerable disorder. One pirate was shot dead. The exchange of fire lasted for half an hour. A British gunboat, the "Moth," which was anchored nearby, responded to the distress call and sailed to assist. Seeing the situation turn against them, the pirates whistled, boarded their original boats, and fled. By the time the "Moth" reached the Wulin steamer, the pirates were long gone. After the killed pirate was transferred to the gunboat, the British ship escorted the Wulin steamer to Shanghai, only returning after reaching the outer reaches of Wusong. It is reported that the Wulin steamer suffered no other losses except for a shoulder injury to the Russian security guard, and the cotton was not taken. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM that evening and is now docked at the Butterfield &amp; Swire wharf, unloading and loading cargo as usual, and is scheduled to continue its voyage to Haimen within days.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Girl Chen Qianwen - Fraudulently Collects Bank Remittance - $1,800 USD Remitted from the US to Shanghai - Collected Under the Name of Chen Sanmei with a Guarantor - Chen Qianwen Arrested and Investigated After Discovery</h3>
<p>Chen Qianwen, a Cantonese girl, 17 years old, residing at 32 Jiande Lane, Yuyuan Road, is suspected of fraudulently obtaining US$1,800 (over 20,000 legal tender yuan) from the Citibank on Jiujiang Road by impersonation. Chen voluntarily surrendered to the General Police Department a few days ago, and was transferred to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning for detention. According to the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu's statement, on October 18 of this year, the Shanghai Citibank received a telegram from Citibank's head office in the United States, stating that US$800 was remitted from San Francisco, USA, to Shanghai for Chen Sanmei to collect. The bank noted that there was no Chen Sanmei account, only Chen Qianwen, a female residing at 14, Lane 1265, Avenue Edward VII. The bank sent a letter addressed to Chen Sanmei. Upon receiving the letter, the suspect went to Citibank, claiming to be Chen Sanmei and requesting the funds. The bank, not knowing Chen Sanmei, and following established procedure, required a guarantor. So, the suspect was instructed to find one. On November 2, the US head office sent another telegram remitting US$1,000 to Chen Sanmei. The Shanghai branch notified her again, and Chen Wenqian enlisted Liang Qihua, a representative of Paramount Pictures, and Shen Chuanren, a translator for the Motion Picture Association of America, as guarantors to collect the funds, claiming the US$1,800 was remitted by her husband from the US. The bank rejected the guarantors as unsuitable. Consequently, Chen Qianwen secured an Italian, "You Ge Qiansha," who had dealings with the bank, as a guarantor and successfully withdrew the funds, depositing them into a passbook under Chen Qianwen's own name. Several days later, Chen withdrew all of the aforementioned funds. Unexpectedly, on November 29, Chen Sanmei, residing at 4 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, attempted to collect a US remittance at Citibank, revealing Chen Qianwen's impersonation. Citibank employees Zhang Zhixiang and the Westerner Keding sought out Chen Qianwen's guarantor, the Italian, who had already left for Japan. Only Liang and Shen were found. Liang et al. only knew Chen's mother, Chen Li, resided at 32 Jiande Lane, Yuyuan Road. They reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple Police a few days ago. Detectives were dispatched to find Chen Li, and yesterday, Chen Qianwen surrendered to the police. Detective Zhang Baoxing is in charge of the investigation. Chen confessed that she had lent all of the US$1,800 to the Italian "You Ge Qiansha." As the Italian has already gone to Japan, the veracity of her statement remains to be investigated. He requested permission for detention. Judge Zhan instructed that Chen Qianwen be detained for seven days for further verification.</p>
<h3>Doorkeeper Arrested for Setting Up Gambling Den - Busted by French Police</h3>
<p>Sun Maizhong (32 years old), a doorkeeper from Yangzhou residing in Xiangshun Lane, Caishi Road, in the French Concession, recently had an eccentric idea. He used his position to entice tenants to gamble in flower lotteries. After collecting the bets daily, he would send them to the Yiji General Factory in Caojiadu. The French Police learned of this and dispatched detectives disguised as gamblers at 11:00 PM the night before. They arrested Sun on the spot, seizing a large number of flower lottery slips and over 60 yuan in gambling money from his coat pockets. He was taken to the police station and transferred to the Second Special Court for investigation yesterday.</p>

<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that a shocking kidnapping case occurred in the extra-Settlement Roads Area, West Shanghai, during daylight on December 1. At approximately 11:00 AM, four bandits, each carrying a handgun, stripped a taxi driver of his uniform on Rue Sikiang. One bandit put on the uniform and drove the car, while the real driver was placed in the back of the car and instructed not to make a sound. The taxi, belonging to a major Shanghai taxi company, drove to an alley off Avenue Billeau. Two bandits got out of the car, walked down the alley, and returned a few minutes later with an eight-year-old Chinese boy. The boy was placed in the back of the car, and the car drove west along Avenue Billeau, deep into the "badlands." There, the car stopped, the bandits took the boy out of the car, and handed the uniform back to the driver. The bandits disappeared into the suburbs with the boy. The injured driver put on his uniform and drove back to the taxi company. The kidnapped child is believed to be hidden somewhere in the "badlands." Also, on Thursday evening at 6:15 PM, three armed bandits kidnapped a Chinese man near Route Mandel and Chongqing Road, forcing him into a car that drove along Avenue Haig and into Fahua Town. They robbed the man of approximately 500 yuan in cash and then released him without firing a shot.</p>

<p>In order to relieve refugees and promote charity lottery tickets, Ye Cheng Industrial Society took advantage of the new launch of "Double Joy" toothpaste and "Ever Ready" toothpaste, and issued the "Great Joy" ticket. Each ticket is a unique number. Anyone using an empty tube of "Great Joy" toothpaste, "Double Joy" toothpaste, or "Ever Ready" toothpaste can redeem a ticket directly at the Society's location at the corner of Sanma Road and Shanxi Road.

They will be issued once a month, with prizes awarded according to the Central Savings Society's draw. The number of tickets issued will also be based on the number of tickets issued by the Central Savings Society. There are four sets of numbers in total, with four special prizes, 116 first prizes, 116 second prizes, 116 third prizes, 116 fourth prizes, 16 supplementary prizes, and over 23,000 consolation prizes. In addition to a large number of charity lottery tickets, there will be cash and toothpaste prizes awarded according to the prize level. The ease of the award procedure, the vast number of prizes, and the speed of the drawing are creating new records for prize-winning events. Therefore, each person uses one tube of "Great Joy" toothpaste, "Double Joy" toothpaste, or "Ever Ready" toothpaste each month, and their hope and rights are no less than joining the Central Savings Society each month. Since the "Great Joy" tickets started being redeemed to great fanfare on the first of this month, people have been coming to redeem them in an endless stream every day.</p>
<h3>Cotton Boat Robbed - All Seven People on Board Shot Dead</h3>
<p>Shi Zhusan, the manager of the Hengxing Cotton Ginning Factory in Meilong Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, sent clerks Wu Shutian and Zhang Xianglian to the Xiji Cotton Shop in Wujiaqiao, Punan, in October to order 700 bales of cotton, worth over 17,000 yuan. At the time, Wu paid 2,000 yuan in advance and hired a local boat in Wujiaqiao to transport 200 bales of cotton, with Zhang Xianglian (the only son of Zhang Fengxiang of Caohejing Town, 22 years old, scheduled to be married on the 5th of next month) escorting the boat, and Wu returning to the factory first. Unexpectedly, when the boat reached a remote area north of Minhang, it was suddenly attacked by over ten bandits, each armed with guns, who forced them to stop. Zhang et al. had no choice but to bring the boat ashore. Somehow, the bandits were angered. In an instant, Zhang Xianglian and the seven boatmen were all shot dead. All the cotton was looted. The remaining empty boat was also smashed by the bandits and sunk to the bottom of the river. When Fengxiang and his wife learned of their son's murder, they were grief-stricken. Nearly a month has passed. Two major criminals in the case were arrested by a guerrilla unit near Maqiao Town a few days ago, and over a hundred bales of cotton were recovered. However, the bodies have not yet been recovered.</p>

<h3>The Son of a Former Wife - Actually Abandoned by the Stepmother - Wang Yulong is Deeply Liked by His Father - The Stepmother Hated and Falsely Claimed Yulong Was an Orphan</h3>
<p>Recently, a case of a stepmother trying to abandon a child occurred in Shanghai. The police are continuing their investigation, hoping to apprehend the person. On the 29th of last month, a middle-aged woman named Zhao Qingshi (transliteration) led a child to the Xinzha Road Police Station, requesting shelter and placement for the child. According to the woman's statement, she lives in the Zhabei area. The child's name is Wang Yulong, nine years old. Because his parents are deceased and no one is taking care of him, she is requesting the police station to do a good deed and transfer the child to a charitable organization for education. The Xinzha Road Police Station took the statement and sent the child to the Department of Child Protection of the Public Works Department for disposition. Unexpectedly, after thorough and lengthy questioning, it was discovered that this was a stepmother's scheme to abandon the child. It turns out that the child's father's name is Wang Weiqing, who is currently working in Suzhou, and the middle-aged woman accompanying the child is the child's stepmother (who has two children of her own). Because the stepmother deeply dislikes Yulong, she falsely claimed that Yulong was an orphan, requesting the police station to take him in. According to Yulong's own account, his father Weiqing is indeed very loving and caring. The Department of Child Protection has sent the child to the Children's Home of the Child Welfare Association. They hope that anyone who recognizes the family can come forward to report and provide clues so that the problem can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

<h3>Endurance of the Environment</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Not long ago, there were a few days of sudden, severe cold. Many children hid in their beds in the morning and refused to get up. Only after being urged by their mothers three or four times did they reluctantly get out of bed to wash. They put on extra layers of warm clothes - woolen sweaters, thermal underwear, woolen overcoats - but still kept complaining about the cold. They simply didn't want to brave the cold to go to school. Copying books and keeping diaries, these extracurricular assignments were all stopped, because their hands were too cold to hold a pen.</p>
<p>Here I want to tell a story of a foreign great man, Nelson, in his childhood to those children who are afraid of the cold. It was a bitterly cold day with snow and wind. Nelson, on his way to school, because he did not want to endure the snow and wind, and longed for the warmth of the fire at home, turned back halfway. Unexpectedly, after arriving home, he was severely lectured by his parents. He had to brace himself and go back to school, which made him feel a surge of courage. From then on, he developed the habit of not fearing difficulties and enduring hardship, and finally became a great man.</p>
<p>Don't you children often hope to become great men in the future? But great men are not made by sitting idly by. The prerequisite is to endure all kinds of hardships. Being able to endure hardship means being able to break the constraints of the environment, and then one can build a great career and become a great person. Why can't you even endure a little cold! In China, there is also the story of reading by the reflection of snow. Everyone knows that it is particularly cold on snowy days. That poor scholar had no oil lamp, but he could still read at night by the reflection of the snow. Children, sitting comfortably under electric lights, can you still complain about the cold and shrink away from laziness!</p>
<p>Why not look at the rickshaw pullers on the road, the janitors in schools, the people who deliver milk for the milk company...? They work all year round, regardless of wind, frost, rain, snow, heat, or cold. They never interrupt their service work in order to eat. Look at your parents, too. Except for holidays, they have to rush around and work hard every day. No matter how cold the weather is, they still have to go to the office with red noses. Why? Because they have to earn money to support you and provide for your education. How can they be afraid of the cold and be lazy!</p>
<p>In comparison, children, you are much happier. You don't have to worry about food or clothing, and you don't have the burden of life. You can devote yourselves to studying and reading seriously. The cold is just a small environmental obstacle, and of course, you should endure it.</p>
<h3>Too Expensive - Dare Not Eat</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>In the 20th year of the Republic of China, there was a little girl in Hankou, not yet ten years old, named Yi Chuanfu. Her brother worked in politics. One day, he bought a pomelo and brought it back for her to eat, but she didn't want to eat it. After he peeled it and gave it to her again, she still didn't want to eat it. "What does this mean?" her brother asked. She replied slowly, "This pomelo was bought by my brother at a high price. I dare not eat something that is so expensive." (Recorded from a children's magazine)</p>
<p>Now, aren't pomelos back on the market? The price is more than twice as expensive as in previous years. Children! When your parents buy them back for you to eat, do you have the same thoughts as her?</p>
<p>Today's prices on the isolated island can be described in eight words: "Everything is expensive, nothing doesn't rise." Children! You probably all understand. So, for everything, whether it's food, supplies, or toys, you must practice the word "thrift," and especially for things that are too expensive, you should suppress your desire for them. In this way, on the one hand, you will be considerate of your parents; on the other hand, you will cultivate the virtue of frugality, and you will be worthy of the title of "good boy."</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been getting colder day by day, and all sectors are calling for an expansion of the campaign to raise winter clothes for refugees. Children! You are members of society, and you should also bear a part of the responsibility. At the very least, you must persuade your family and friends to respond to this movement. In addition, save your daily expenses and do not eat things that are too expensive. If you can do this, you will have fulfilled your responsibility.</p>
<p>Too expensive - dare not eat. I hope you can do it, too expensive - don't eat. On the other hand, if you can make your parents do it, too expensive - don't buy; then, it will be even more perfect.</p>
<h3>Happy Event—A Ming's Escape Notes, Forty-Fifth—</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>Scene after scene, the New Year decorations in the village were clearly reflected in A Ming's eyes. In a blink of an eye, it was the Lantern Festival again, and the village had the same custom of lighting lanterns. On that evening, most families lit all kinds of paper lanterns, but they were all simple, like "Zhuangyuan" (top scholar) lanterns. In front of the doors, inside the houses, and in the courtyards, lanterns were hung high one after another. Looking from the alley, the lanterns of each household formed a string, which was quite a sight, as if a lantern festival had been opened. A Ming's family, of course, had no mood to celebrate this festival, and the dim oil lamp was still flickering. The landlady was really good to them, and even sent a few maids to hang lanterns in their courtyard - A Ming's home suddenly became much brighter, and at least had some decorations to make the festival not wasted. She even invited them to go to the ancestral hall to see other people's happy events. Such a landlady was rare.</p>
<p>Happy events, especially the happy events in this village, which foreign strangers would not want to visit and broaden their horizons? And the curious A Ming was particularly happy, of course, not willing to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>A large group of villagers seemed to have gathered together after hearing a concentration signal in the army, and the happy event in the ancestral hall did attract this group of people, making a lot of noise and turning the quiet ancestral hall into a noisy auditorium.</p>
<p>Holding a happy event in the ancestral hall was extremely novel in A Ming's mind. Indeed, this was a special custom in the village, because there was no restaurant there, and the houses were so small that they could not even accommodate four or five tables of dishes. So, they had to use this spacious ancestral hall as an auditorium.</p>
<p>That day, a family was marrying off their daughter to another village nearby. The ancestral hall had already been decorated in a neat and presentable manner, but it could not be simpler. On the stone platform in the center, a pair of thick happy candles were inserted high on the stone candle holders, and the flames illuminated the hall brightly. (Because A Ming's eyes were usually accustomed to the light of the oil lamp, when he encountered candlelight, it was like being under gasoline lamp light. In fact, the light of those two candles was very limited, and it was also in this vast ancestral hall.) Many men wearing red flowers were sorting out red invitations, which were to be sent to foreign guests.</p>
<p>There was a burst of noise outside the ancestral hall. It turned out that the bridal sedan chair from the other village had entered this village. The sound of trumpets, gongs, shouts, and drums came in waves, pouring into the ears of everyone waiting outside the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The ceremonial guard was mighty and disorganized, getting closer and closer to the ancestral hall, and the mixed sounds were quite loud. After a string of firecrackers, the very ornate bridal sedan chair entered the gate of the ancestral hall. The trumpet players were the village strongmen trained as buglers. What they were playing, was it military music? Or wedding music? How interesting!</p>
<p>A large group of people surrounded the bridal sedan chair to see it clearly. After a full hour, the bride, dressed in bright red and green like a Bodhisattva in a temple, came slowly. Except that the bride's height was almost like a child, which could be seen, nothing else could be seen. Her face was covered by that hateful embroidered handkerchief, not allowing any ventilation. Amid the extraordinary chaos, the bride entered the bridal sedan chair. The ceremonial guard then scattered and embarked on the original road to the groom's house.</p>
<p>Later, A Ming learned that the bride was only thirteen years old when she got married. No wonder she was so short. Early marriage was also prevalent in the village. Our country is called the "Sick Man of East Asia," and this bad custom of early marriage must bear a large part of the responsibility.</p>
<h3>Campaign to Collect Winter Clothing for Refugee Children</h3>
<p>— Lu Qizhao</p>
<p>Now is the winter season, and the cold wind is blowing fiercely. There are countless compatriots in Shanghai who have been displaced and do not have winter clothes to wear. They are relying on us for relief. I now have a small suggestion, listed below: All older compatriots should relieve the older compatriots who have been displaced, and all of us younger compatriots should relieve the younger compatriots who have been displaced. I am one of the younger compatriots and should take the responsibility of relieving the younger compatriots who have been displaced.</p>
<p>There is now the China Child Welfare Association. It is collecting 10,000 pieces of winter clothing for refugee children. All of us younger compatriots, if you have old clothes, pants, etc.: or national currency of two, three, four, five jiao, etc., can send them to the China Child Welfare Association, address No. 208, Zhonghui Building, Edward Road, to relieve our young compatriots so that they will not be harmed by the cold wind. Moreover, now is a time of national crisis, and young compatriots are the future pillars of our Republic of China. We should cultivate them and relieve them. This is an immeasurable merit!</p>
<h3>The Blue Dwarf (11)</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>A Li, being in this exquisite and delicate environment, suddenly felt that she was so clumsy and oversized. For example, her feet, for someone her age, were very well-proportioned and not too big, but if she put one foot on the window of that small house, she would definitely knock over everything inside the window.</p>
<p>A Li stared around for a while, muttering to herself, "Oh, I didn't expect myself to be so big and clumsy! Look at me, I seem to have turned into a clumsy farmer; I have to shrink my body to be just like them!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a voice came from beside her, saying, "Yes, there are all kinds of inconveniences!" A Li quickly lowered her head to see who was talking. It turned out to be the dwarf who had initially talked to her. She was a little embarrassed, thinking, "What I was thinking in my heart, I didn't say it out loud, how could he know it?" So she opened her mouth and said, "No matter what, there are conveniences on one hand and inconveniences on the other. For example, it is very suitable for you to live here, but when you come to our world, don't you feel that your bodies are too small?" The dwarf nodded and said, "That's right, that's right, things do have conveniences and inconveniences."</p>
<p>A Li saw that he did not refute her words, and thought to herself that the dwarf's temper was quite good. So she came up with an idea to find out some of their shortcomings and criticize them. She then said slowly, "Your village is indeed very small and beautiful, but - please forgive me, I don't mean to be rude -" The dwarf quickly said, "No, you won't be rude, because Auntie once told you to be polite to us." A Li was surprised and said, "Whose aunt? She is not your aunt!" The dwarf quietly replied, "Whether she is your aunt or my aunt, in short, Auntie's words are correct." A Li heard this arrogant tone and was very unhappy, wishing she could stomp her feet and scold him, but when she thought of her aunt's words, she didn't dare to disobey, so she swallowed her anger and didn't say anything more.</p>
<p>She paused for a moment and then said quietly, "What I want to say is just to express some of my opinions, and I can't say it is rude. From my perspective, everything in your village is indeed small and beautiful, but it lacks variety and is a bit monotonous. If there were more variety, it would be even more beautiful. Look at yourself, aren't many houses in the village completely the same, without any changes? And the people in your village, and your wives in those brown clothes, aren't they also exactly the same, without any changes? Wait, I still want to ask you, do you have children?" The dwarf said anxiously, "Of course we do, and there are many of them." A Li asked, "So where are the children? Could it be that they are all asleep?" As she spoke, she spoke in a mocking tone, thinking that it was just getting dark, and the children would definitely not be asleep so early." Who knew that the dwarf would calmly answer, "Yes, they are all asleep, and most of them are dreaming now. You always know that children like to dream." As he said this, he looked up at A Li, with a very strange expression on his face, and even his voice was very strange. A Li also felt a strange feeling in her heart, thinking that his words seemed to be directed at her. Isn't she also a child? Isn't she also dreaming?</p>

<h3>Ideal Becomes Reality Nine Performances of "Chasing Han Xin" A Grand Crossover Performance by Veteran Actors of Civil and Military Roles</h3>
<p>— Sui Wo</p>
<p>Three months ago, I suggested in this publication that the relief authorities could hold a "Grand Qipai Crossover Performance" based on my suggestion. Last month, the Refugee Relief Association prepared to perform a charity show and showed some interest in my suggestion. However, Qilintong himself, to avoid sectarianism, did not want to use the term "Grand Qipai Crossover Performance." After some discussion, the ideal has finally become a reality. The Relief Association authorities have scheduled to stage this good show at the Tianchan Stage on the 7th of this month. Although it has been renamed "Grand Crossover Performance by Veteran Actors of Civil and Military Roles," it is actually derived from a "Grand Qipai Crossover Performance." The program is arranged as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Fuying Double</p>
<p>Yu Zongying Performs</p>
<p>Filial Son</p>
<p>Li Ruchun (Fan Kuai)</p>
<p>Chen Hefeng (Zhang Liang)</p>
<p>Qilintong (Fan Zeng)</p>
<p>Gao Baisui (Xiang Yu)</p>
<p>Yang Baotong (Liu Bang)</p>
<p>Wang Fuying (Xiang Bo)</p>
<p>Hongmen Banquet</p>
<p>Zhao Songqiao</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan</p>
<p>Wang Zhuangbai</p>
<p>Lending a Head</p>
<p>Qilintong</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan</p>
<p>Gao Baisui</p>
<p>Chen Hefeng</p>
<p>Wang Chunbai</p>
<p>Chen Xiaomu</p>
<p>Yang Baotong</p>
<p>Li Ruchun</p>
<p>Liu Wenkui</p>
<p>(Energetically plays Xiao He)</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou</p>
<p>Wang Fuying</p>
<p>Yu Zongying</p>
<p>Li Junyu</p>
<p>(Four play Han Xin)</p>
<p>Liu Yunfang</p>
<p>Qian Lintong</p>
<p>Zhang Mingsheng</p>
<p>Pan Dingxin</p>
<p>(Four play Liu Bang)</p>
<p>Liu Binkun</p>
<p>Jiao Baokui</p>
<p>Li Hansan</p>
<p>Xiao Wenlin</p>
<p>(Four play Xia Houying)</p>
<p>(Full)</p>
<p>Xiao He Chasing Han Xin under the Moon</p>
<p>Liang Cishan (Woodcutter)</p>
<p>The above program is roughly the same as what I previously proposed. The distribution of roles in the Hongmen Banquet play is entirely based on my idea. Qilintong unexpectedly plays Fan Zeng, which is bound to be a surprising performance. The finale of Chasing Han Xin brings together veteran actors of civil and military roles in one performance, which can be said to be an unprecedented creation. It is said that Qilintong only plays the later part of ascending the stage to pay homage to the marshal, Zhao Lao starts the performance with a round stage run, and three Golden Halls change three Xiao Hes. Six play Han Xin, four play Liu Bang, and four play Xia Houying, all of which are innovative. This one play alone is enough to cause a sensation.</p>
<p>Theater News The Gongyu Yaji Drama Research Society will hold its fifth public performance today (3rd) at the Gubal Apartment Hall on Guba Road. Seven plays will be performed each day and night, all of which are wonderful masterpieces. The list of plays is recorded as follows: (Day) Hu Yunming, Pan Jingmei, Celebrating the Pearl; Tang Lifen, Lu Chenghou, Teaching His Son; Sun Minhou, Ying Shaomei, Mu Kezhai; Ye Anna, Chunxiang's School闹; Zhu Shuzhang, Zhou Shunhua, Bao Lian Deng; Bai Shunyi, Min Dihua, Woman Escorting; Yu Jingmei, Pan Jingmei, Sangwei Sent a Letter. (Night) Zhu Zhongchang, Min Dihua; Li Zhitang, Liu Zuwei, Tian Zhongyu, Empty City Plan; Wei Shenpu, Yumen Pass; Yang Jingyi, Li Zhimei, Dragon Town; Yu Jimei, Min Dihua, Sun Minhou, Chen Yunzhang, Cui Ping Mountain; Hu Zhongwen, Sun Minhou, Wei Xuepu, Yang Junhao, Yellow Crane Tower.

<h3>Treasure Robbery in the Ancient Pagoda (New Film Introduction) "Sherlock Holmes"</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>The absolute difference between "Treasure Robbery in the Ancient Pagoda" and "Phantom of the Ancient Castle" is that in the former, the appearance of Moore Tai leaves the audience with the impression that he is the culprit, while in the latter, it is not until the end that it is proved who the culprit is. Therefore, the performance effect of "Treasure Robbery in the Ancient Pagoda" is not as tense and exciting as "Phantom of the Ancient Castle."</p>
<p>"Treasure Robbery in the Ancient Pagoda" develops two cases simultaneously and interactively. Because the culprit appears first, director Wegg omits him after Professor Moore Tai sends out the threatening letter, focusing the audience's attention on Branden's unease and on the assassination of Lloyd. This point does make up for the flaws in the script, but I think that the section where Moore Tai is declared innocent in court at the beginning might as well be deleted. Then, from Holmes accepting the commission of Sir Donner, the manager of the ancient pagoda royal palace jewelry, and Branden, the two cases will develop interactively. Then, the two climaxes of Lloyd being killed and Holmes learning of Moore Tai's conspiracy from the murderer of Lloyd and rushing to the ancient pagoda to solve the case will be more powerful.</p>
<p>In the handling of these two climaxes, the director's grasp of the atmosphere is successful. When Lloyd was killed, Holmes' carriage was speeding; Lloyd and Hunter's actions were secret; after the miserable scream, several close-up shots of the police, grooms, etc., made this scene very compact and powerful. The latter scene of Moore Tai and Holmes' pursuit is also equally tense. The director's use of the London fog and strong light money further strengthens the suffocating air of the detective film.</p>
<p>Other things, such as outlining the personality of Holmes and Watson, are also lovely</p>
<p>Basil Rathbone's Holmes is successful in highlighting the character by using his gazing eyes.</p>
<h3>Li Li from Beiping Joins Yihua Starring in "Burning the Biyun Palace"</h3>
<p>Li Li from Beiping returned to Shanghai from the United States three weeks ago, which few people know. When she returned to China, she only sent a telegram to Yan Youxiang, the little owner of Yihua Company, from the ship. Therefore, on the day of her arrival, people in the film industry were unaware of it. At that time, Yan Youxiang contacted her about joining Yihua to film movies, and Li immediately agreed, but said that she had to return to Hong Kong to deal with private affairs before coming again. Therefore, Li Li only stayed in Shanghai for one night and then took a ship to Hong Kong. The reason why Yihua kept it secret was that the time was not yet ripe. Now that Li Li has come to Shanghai from Hong Kong and it has been decided that she will star in "Burning the Biyun Palace," there is little doubt that Li has joined Yihua.</p>

<h3>From Soviet-Finnish Negotiations to Soviet-Finnish Conflict</h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>The current evolution of the European war situation does not lie in the battles on the battlefield, but in the fierce struggle of international diplomacy, economy, and propaganda, especially the fierce battles on the stage of foreign affairs. Everyone is engaging in intrigue and using the wrists of vertical and horizontal alliances. In just half a month, the Soviet Union first signed mutual assistance agreements with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, making the Baltic units form a solid outer line. Then, it invited Finnish representatives to Moscow for talks. Unexpectedly, it fell into a stalemate, and the relationship between the two countries suddenly became tense, to the point of war. Why did these negotiations suffer setbacks, and what is the crux of the matter? We need to review it here.</p>
<p>Before discussing this article, the past relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland should be explained first:</p>
<p>Past Relations between the Soviet Union and Finland</p>
<p>Finland is located in northern Europe, on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, and is one of the four neutral countries in Northern Europe. Finland used to be part of Sweden for seven hundred years. It was conquered by old Russia in 1808. In 1917, the Russian Revolution occurred, and it declared independence in early December. In January 1918, the Soviet government recognized Finland's independence. In July 1919, communist forces were rampant in Finland, causing a powerful anti-communist movement in Finland; Led by the Lapuans Party, in July 1930, it prepared to conduct negotiations. Why did the Soviet-Finnish negotiations fluctuate, and the crux of the matter lies in the Hanko issue. Hanko is a commercial port at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland, only sixty miles away from the Finnish capital Helsinki. The Soviet Union demanded to establish a naval base in Hanko, which would not only control the Gulf of Finland, but also control the entire Baltic Sea. However, Finland believed that Hanko was the throat of the Gulf of Finland - also the founding throat of Finland - and absolutely refused to cede it, causing the negotiations to fall into a stalemate. Hanko is not only closely related to Finland, but also has a great relationship with Sweden. Originally, Hanko was only over a hundred miles away from the Swedish capital Stockholm. If the Soviet Union stationed troops there, it would control Stockholm, and if the Soviet Union further occupied the Aland Islands, Sweden would be greatly threatened. Therefore, Sweden is extremely concerned about the future of Finland.</p>
<p>Since the negotiations fell into a stalemate, the Soviet Union has fiercely criticized Finland in newspapers. At the same time, the Lapuans Party forced the Farmer's Party cabinet to resign, and the parliament was also dissolved. However, the activities of the Lapuans Party became more rampant, which aroused the anger of the people across the country. As a result, the activities of the Lapuans Party temporarily subsided for a while. However, in February 1932, more than four thousand Lapuans Party members mobilized in the area of Manwansala, attempting to occupy Helsinki. The army and defense forces of Helsinki were loyal to the government, so in less than a day, the Lapuans Party's rebellion was quelled, and not a drop of blood was shed. In the same year, Finland and the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of friendship. Since the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations and loudly appealed for peace, the Finnish people have become more fond of the Soviet Union. However, since Litvinov resigned, the Soviet Union's policy has changed, suddenly dividing Poland with Germany and then placing Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania under protection, immediately arousing strong resentment from Finland.</p>
<p>The Crux of Soviet-Finnish Negotiations</p>
<p>However, the Soviet-Finnish negotiations have been going on since October 11th, almost two months, and the unit process has been quite tortuous and difficult. At that time, the Soviet side had a fairly firm attitude and had long had a clear plan at the beginning of the negotiations, while Finland was willing to maintain the freedom and equality that an independent country should have and was unwilling to make excessive concessions. Therefore, the views of the two countries were quite far apart, causing the negotiations to fall into a stalemate. Recently, war has finally broken out, arousing the attention of people all over the world.</p>
<h3>Nanning Sketches</h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>Since suffering an unprecedented defeat in the Xiangbei Campaign, the Japanese army, in a state of frustration and anxiety, considered launching a new offensive to salvage its military decline. Their recent forced landing in the Beihai, Longmen, and Qisha areas was intended to cut off the highway between Guangxi and Vietnam and to seize Nanning, thereby recovering the reputation lost in the Xiangbei rout.</p>
<p>Evolution and Position</p>
<p>Nanning, also known as Yongning, is the capital of Guangxi province. During the Han dynasty, it belonged to the Yulin Commandery. In the Jin dynasty, Jinxing County was established as the seat of Jinxing Commandery. During the Kaihuang era of the Sui dynasty, it was renamed Xuanhua County, under Yuan Prefecture, and in the early years of the Daye era, it belonged to Yulin Commandery. From the Tang and Song dynasties onward, it served as the seat of prefectures and commanderies. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was the seat of Nanning Prefecture. After the establishment of the Republic of China, it was renamed Yongning County, but the general public still calls it Nanning. Located near the Guangdong Sea in the south, bordering Annam to the west, connecting to Guizhou and Yunnan in the north, and overlooking Xunwu in the east, it occupies a strategically important geographical position. The city is situated on the north bank of the Yu River and was built during the Huangyou era of the Song dynasty. Legend has it that the prefect at the time dreamed of a deity who told him, "Build the city in the shape of a snake, and it will be successful." The next day, a snake was indeed seen coiling around the land, so the city was built according to its shape. However, it was destroyed by a major flood in the fourth year of the Qianlong reign. The current city walls were rebuilt in the sixth year of Qianlong, but some remnants of the old city still exist. Many years ago, this place was just an ordinary commercial port in the remote southwest, but in recent years, as the Guangxi provincial government accelerated its reorganization, Nanning has become one of China's model cities.</p>
<p>Magnificent Cityscape</p>
<p>Under the slogan of "Building Guangxi," the cityscape of Nanning has indeed undergone a tremendous transformation. The streets formerly paved with stone slabs have now been largely rebuilt into smooth asphalt roads. Many of the old and simple houses have also been renovated into magnificent and spacious new buildings. The most bustling streets are Nanning Main Street and Delin Road, where most of the major businesses are concentrated. Nanning Main Street is mainly home to stores selling goods from Suzhou and Hangzhou, as well as gold shops. Delin Road is dominated by shops selling local goods, hardware, soy sauce, groceries, and sundries. Muchang Street is filled with brokerage firms dealing in matches, foreign yarn, and medicinal materials, as well as shipping companies. Yanfa Street is home to shops selling salt, peanut oil, bean curd, tung oil, and cowhide. Datie Street is full of shops selling porcelain and iron pots. However, while Nanning is bustling and lively, it is not extravagant, and a sense of emerging vitality pervades the entire city. The goods displayed in the shops are mostly domestic products, with fewer imported goods. The people walking in the streets, whether military, government, academic, or business, all wear cloth hats, cloth clothes, and cloth shoes. There are hardly any lavishly dressed or fashionable men and women. These are all the achievements of the Guangxi authorities in the past three years and the result of putting politics on the right track.</p>
<p>Abundant Products</p>
<p>Because Nanning is surrounded by fertile fields and lush vegetation, its products are very abundant, earning it the reputation of "Guangxi's Granary." The main product is sugar cane, which in its heyday could produce over ten million catties per year. Although production has declined somewhat, it is still enough to compete with foreign white sugar. In addition, rice, fennel, butter, raw silk, tobacco, oranges, tangerines, jackfruit, etc., are also produced in large quantities, with an average annual export value of 2.1 million customs taels. As for mineral resources, there is a vast mining area with high-quality lignite in Ertang, Santang, and the Gaoling area across the river. The coal seams are three feet thick, and many people dig it up and transport it to the city for sale. At the bends of Lingli Bay, there are placer gold mines, and on Fosha Ridge, there are galena and hematite mines, all with abundant reserves.</p>
<p>Famous Scenic Spots and Historical Sites</p>
<p>The most famous scenic spot in Nanning is Wangxian Slope, which towers over the east of the city. During the Huangyou era of the Song dynasty, Wu Xiang Wang Di Qing and Generals Yu Jing and Sun Mian camped here during their southern campaign against Nong Zhigao. Later, the people of Yongning built the Temple of the Three Dukes on the slope to commemorate their merits in suppressing the rebellion, and it has been worshiped continuously throughout the seasons. Later, Su Jian was also enshrined. Wang Shouren renamed it the Temple of the Five Dukes, and during the Kangxi era of the Qing dynasty, Mang Yitu was also enshrined, hence the name Temple of the Six Dukes. Qingfeng Tower is located in the Higher Court (formerly the Prefectural Government Office) on Macao Street. During the Song dynasty, it was Qingfeng Terrace, but it had long been destroyed. During the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty, Prefect Fang Yu built Qingfeng Pavilion on its site, which is commonly called Qingfeng Tower.</p>
<p>Nanning has now been temporarily lost. However, students and militia from all over Guangxi are enthusiastically enlisting and heading to the front lines to defend their homeland with iron and blood. Under the command of Bai Chongxi and other generals, they will surely demonstrate their combat skills and have a day to recover Nanning.</p>

<h3>Beihai</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>The first place the Japanese troops landed was Beihai. Beihai, located north of Tokyo Bay, is situated in the Sanyou Port of Lianjiang. It was opened as a commercial port in 1876 according to the Yantai Treaty. It is accessible by steamboat to Haikou on Hainan Island, a journey of only ten hours. The harbor is good and free of hidden reefs. On land, there is a highway leading north to Hepu (Lianzhou). From Hepu, the highway branches northwest, connecting to Qinzhou, Lingshan, and Fangcheng. This is a hub of communication in southern Guangdong. More than thirty years ago, due to the water conservancy of the Lianjiang, Wuli River, and Daqin River, it implicitly became a port for goods dispersing eastward from the upper reaches of the West River. However, since Guangxi's Cangwu (Wuzhou) and Yunnan's Mengzi were opened as commercial ports, this advantageous position has disappeared.</p>
<p>Xiaodong Another noteworthy place name is Xiaodong. Xiaodong is located south of the Shiwan Mountains, a branch of the Goulou Mountain Range, and is more than 100 kilometers away from Yongning (Nanning). According to mileage estimates, the advance of mechanized units does not seem to require much time. However, the Goulou Mountain Range is truly an important barrier. High ridges over 3,000 feet are no less than a natural moat, and the Japanese army's penetration will ultimately face great difficulties. While the Yongqin Highway is convenient for travelers, the Shiwan Mountains are undoubtedly a superior defensive barrier in combat.</p>
<p>Qinzhou Qinzhou has already fallen. Of course, we will also consider it a loss. Qinzhou was originally Qinzhou, the leading town formerly under the Qinlian Circuit. In terms of water conservancy, it has the advantage of Longmen Port, which is precisely the throat of the Qin River's outlet to the sea. However, according to reliable surveys, the water conservancy of Tokyo Bay is far inferior to that of Guangzhou Bay. Therefore, in his National Reconstruction Strategy, Sun Yat-sen considered dredging and building a port there only as a second-class port. On land, the Yongqin Highway leads directly to Yongning, which is the gateway to Guangxi. Heading southwest through Fangcheng to Dongxing forms a communication line connecting to Vietnam. Qinzhou is 150 kilometers away from Dongxing. The Beilun River, the southernmost end of China's coastline, is also located there. The most important resource in Qinzhou is manganese ore, because manganese is essential for steelmaking and has significant value in national defense. Moreover, the reserves are exceptionally abundant. However, for the Japanese, even if they wanted to utilize it now, it would probably be beyond their capabilities.</p>
<p>Yongning The Japanese army, using Qinzhou as a base, aims for Yongning. Yongning is the center of the south, and in terms of terrain, it holds a commanding position. It leads east to Xun (Guiping) and Wu (Cangwu), west to Longzhou (Zhennanguan), south to Qinlian, and north to Maping. By seizing Yongning, the Japanese army vainly hopes to use it as a preliminary step to control Guangxi.</p>
<p>Liuzhou Currently, in the strategic defense of Greater Guangxi, the value of Maping is even more important. Maping was formerly known as Liuzhou. The Liu River flows around the city, which is located on the right bank of the river. In terms of the entire province, it can be said to be right in the center. Transportation routes radiate in all directions. In terms of transportation, it is an important city between Guangdong and Guangxi (upper reaches of the Liu River).</p>
<p>Hepu In addition to Yongning, we cannot ignore another route of the Japanese offensive, which is to proceed northeast along Hepu and Yulin to seize Cangwu and block the passage between Guangdong and Guangxi. However, the Japanese army's actions are ultimately unwise: due to the limited convenience of using Longmen Port, subsequent supplies will encounter some difficulties, and our army's deployment on the West River is even stronger. Another point worth noting is the threat to France. The Japanese army seems to be only attempting to cut off the passage between China and Vietnam, making our country's arms transport difficult. However, all our preparations will surely disappoint Japan. And the deeper invasion of southern Guangdong after occupying Hainan Island is at least an embarrassment for France, because they cannot but feel that this is the beginning of the shaking of their Far Eastern interests. Indeed, Japan's military operations in southern Guangdong must be said to have national significance.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Gold Production</h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>According to the book Atlesof To—day and To—morrow published this year, the total value of the world's existing gold is £2,889,000,000, with the United States holding the most, followed by the Central Bank of France.</p>
<p>Although China does not have much gold reserves, its gold production is not small. Recent statistics show that from this month (November of the 28th year of the Republic) onwards, in the past twelve months, 180,000 ounces of gold were produced, and in the twelve months before that, 130,000 ounces. From these figures, we can see the increase in the annual amount of gold production. If we improve the mining methods and carry out large-scale excavations, these underground treasures can be said to be inexhaustible and endlessly useful.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, Chinese banks have purchased and stored 143,000 ounces of gold for the government in the past twelve months. If calculated at a value of US$200 per ounce, the value of the gold stored by the banks would be US$28,600,000.</p>

<h3>American Ambassador to France William Bullitt — President Roosevelt's Confidant</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Ambassador William Bullitt is President Roosevelt's confidant. Bullitt is a highly influential advisor on decisions regarding U.S. foreign policy towards Europe, and the President almost always follows his advice.</p>
<p>Like other ambassadors, Bullitt is eloquent, witty, and capable, possessing all the smoothness that a diplomat should have. We must remember that the American ambassador does not represent the American government, nor Congress, nor the American people. He represents the American president who decides foreign policy. Therefore, in addition to transmitting messages from the coast to the White House at all times, Bullitt has a transoceanic long-distance telephone conversation with Roosevelt almost every day. Recently, he returned to the United States, had intimate conversations, and stayed overnight in the same room. The President repeatedly urged him to stay, showing their close relationship.</p>
<p>The American Embassy in France is quite magnificent, with 170 rooms. Since the outbreak of this European war, Bullitt has been busy day and night, constantly providing information to Roosevelt. In ordinary times, he has to handle at least 9,000 letters and messages each month, and also receive guests. Wartime official duties are even more tedious. Moreover, he also serves as a representative of the army, navy, and commerce, so although he lives in this magnificent building, he leads a very laborious life.</p>
<p>His entertainment expenses are not much, only US$4,800 per year. The ambassador to London has US$70,000, but he has a private income of US$45,000 per year, plus a government salary of US$17,500, which is enough to make up for the shortfall. His residence is on Avenue d'Iéna, which can be said to be the center of Parisian society. His daily exercise is golf and tennis, and he especially loves horseback riding.</p>
<p>Bullitt grew up in France from an early age, and his French is very fluent, so it is most suitable for him to be the ambassador to France. One of his ancestors, named Joseph Bullitt, was originally French and immigrated to the United States in 1637. Since there is a relationship in bloodline, he naturally has a close affection for the French. Vlaner said: "Bullitt's current closeness to the French is like the past three hundred years being just a week."</p>
<p>Recently, the United States amended the Neutrality Act, abolishing the embargo on arms and other items, giving great assistance to Britain and France. Britain and the United States are of the same race, and they should help each other in times of difficulty. France also benefits greatly from having this American ambassador, so although the United States does this out of a sense of justice, these indirect reasons may also be one of the factors.</p>
<h3>Women and War</h3>
<p>— Ruiwen</p>
<p>Women participating in war like men is something that has existed since ancient times. In the Middle Ages, if the lord of a fortress led troops out to fight, then the mistress of the fortress had to command the soldiers under her to defend the fortress if she encountered someone leading troops to attack. In modern times, women's participation in rear-area work has become even more active. In 1914, after the outbreak of the last World War, British men were transferred to France to fight. At that time, after a long period of peace, British women were pampered and did not know what war was. Every British soldier who went to the front always thought that after they left Britain, their women would forever remain peacefully behind the times. However, not long after, when they had the opportunity to return on leave, what surprised the country was that women not only drove ambulances and trucks transporting military supplies, but the entire United Kingdom became a world of women's work. The trains were staffed by women, the trams were staffed by women, and women also wore gray uniforms, transporting wounded soldiers from the front lines to the rear in large numbers, which was extremely brave and astonishing, far from the weak and pitiful image they had imagined. After this war, all air defense and rescue work was taken over by women, and women became even more active in the war.</p>

<h3>Chinese Christian Church Child Labor Nursery</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>Yesterday, the author made a special trip to the Child Labor Nursery on Yanping Road to visit Mr. Tao Yongfu, the person in charge, and learned about the internal situation as follows:</p>
<p>The Process of Establishment</p>
<p>At the time of establishment, there were about one hundred child laborers. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Ewo Cotton Mill allocated a workshop on Yulin Road, and President Mei organized the Second Child Labor Nursery. Since then, the nursery affairs have gradually developed. At that time, there were 33 two-story buildings and 23 ground-floor buildings, enough to accommodate 600 child laborers. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, entrusted by Shenxin Mills No. 5 and No. 6, a Shenxin Workers' Children's School was established at Gaolang Bridge. In the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China, entrusted by Shenxin Mills No. 1 and No. 8, a second school was established in Zhoujiaqiao. In total, the four locations could enroll 1,000 child laborers each year, and at its peak, it reached 1,300. When the August 13th Incident broke out, because the nursery was in the war zone, it was necessary to dismiss the child laborers. President Mei led 50 homeless orphans to stay temporarily in the Renji Infant Welfare Home. This spring, they moved to Yanping Road in western Shanghai to continue classes. In addition to the 50 orphans, poor children from nearby can also attend school for free. There are a total of 328 male and female students, mostly day students. Boarding students must pay a small fee for meals according to the economic situation of their families.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>The current Child Labor Nursery only has two two-story buildings, and in addition to the four classrooms (grades three and four use one classroom, and grades five and six also merge), there are only two bedrooms. One room is a girls' dormitory made up of a sun terrace, and the other is a toddlers' bedroom. Older boys have to use their desks as beds at night. Although the place is small, it is kept very clean and orderly.</p>
<p>In the past, the Child Labor Nursery was divided into three parts: a nursery, a free school, and an orphanage. All children of workers could enter the nursery. Every morning when they went to work, they would send their children here, and the nurses, nurses, and nannies hired by the nursery would take care of them. In the evening when they finished work, their parents would pick them up again. The school was divided into kindergarten, elementary school, and middle school. Most of the children in the orphanage were sent by their parents, and some were sent by the church.</p>
<p>Relationship with Family</p>
<p>The child laborers do not sever relations with their families. Although they can find their own way out after graduation, the nursery can also help introduce them to jobs. As for the orphans without family members, older girls can be matched by the nursery, and others are introduced by the nursery to work in factories or learn crafts in other shops. Those with higher talents also have the hope of continuing their studies, but since the outbreak of the war, the market has been in a slump, so it is even more difficult to introduce orphans to work outside.</p>
<p>Economic Situation</p>
<p>Although the Child Labor Nursery is of a Christian nature, it has no direct relationship with the church, so the church does not provide financial assistance. Before the war, the nursery's monthly expenses were 2,000 yuan, but now, because it has reduced its scope, it only needs 800 yuan per month. Originally, factories and the Shanghai Municipal Council had subsidies every year, and the deficit was raised from the outside world, but now the factories have stopped the subsidies, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has also canceled the subsidies because the nursery is located on a road built beyond the settlement. Therefore, the nursery's finances are even more strained. Recently, President Mei has traveled far to the United States, hoping to raise some funds for the development of the Child Labor Nursery.</p>
<h3>Records of the Extraordinary</h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>Normally, two-tenths of a gram of arsenic can be fatal. But in one place—the city of Styria (formerly part of Austria)—people often feed arsenic to infants, hoping that they will grow up to be beautiful. And the amount of arsenic consumed increases with age. Now an adult can eat three grams of arsenic without any danger.</p>
<p>On the Edison Memorial Tower in Menlo Park, New Jersey, USA, there is an extremely large light bulb. This light bulb was custom-made by the Corning Glass Manufacturing Company of New York. It is fourteen feet long and has a maximum diameter of nine feet six inches. The bulb is equipped with 960 incandescent lamps and a 24-inch reflector, and the light emitted at night can illuminate the sky for hundreds of miles around.</p>
<p>More than 900 companies in the United States are run by tens of thousands of young people, both male and female, aged 16 to 21. New York alone has 60. From servants to managers, all positions are held by children. The goods they sell are mostly birdcages, flower pots, knives, wooden bowls, chairs, cuffs, toys, ashtrays, cigarette cases, purses, canes, paper cutters, and other daily odds and ends.</p>
<h3>About "Human" Words</h3>
<p>Humans drink an average of one ton of water per year. If one ton is equal to 1,500 catties, then one person drinks four catties and one-half ounces of water per day.</p>
<p>Humans breathe an average of ten times per minute; therefore, they breathe 20,340 times in a whole day of 24 hours. The weight of air that must be inhaled every day is 21 catties, and the weight of air that must be inhaled every year is 7,665 catties.</p>
<p>Blood accounts for 5.5% of the human body. If a person loses three-quarters of their blood, they will die. For example, if a person weighs 100 pounds, then their blood weighs more than five pounds. If four pounds of blood are lost, they will definitely die.</p>
<p>Human body temperature is between 36 and 37 degrees Celsius. Any more or less is a morbid state. In typhoid fever, the temperature can rise above 46 degrees.</p>
<p>The human brain weighs approximately 39 taels.</p>
