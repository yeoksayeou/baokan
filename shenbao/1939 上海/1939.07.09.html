<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海敎育界最近糾紛事件</h3>
<p>最近上海敎育界頗發生若干糾紛事件：或以立案問題，互致詰責；或以正統問題，彼此譏彈；或以締造功勳自詡，指他人爲掠奪；或以往昔地位自鳴，視他人爲僭竊。具體事例，不一而足，其在門牆之內自作齟齬者，局外人非熟悉底蘊，未能認識眞相，則亦止於齟齬門牆之內已耳；至若騰載報章，廣播公衆，若懷久務本之爭，揚中本校分校之辨者，則事實既經暴露，社會亦不能不加以相當注意。雖以上海社會之大，三數學校縱使發生風波，其影響所及，曾何殊於滄海一粟；然以中國社會習慣而論，學府行動，輒繫觀聽；矧在近頃，黑暗氣氛籠罩孤島，文化教育，無日不在鷹犬環伺之中，今茲三數學校紛爭事件，未始不能予人以抵瑕蹈隙之機，一旦魔手乘虛而入，敎育界整個前途行且發生危機。我人凛臨深履薄之戒，竊願此三數學校相忍爲國，妥自處置，愼勿使事態擴大；而三數校以外之各校，亦愼以鬩牆爲戒，勿使八一三以來上海敎育界堅固之長城日漸毀損也。</p>
<p>我人姑不必就三數校事件作個別別之考察，第籠統言之，則此三數校所爭執之事項，大要不外所謂正統與僭據之爭而已。正統僭據之問題，華軍未撤離上海以前所無有也，上海以外之各地亦無有也；唯此時此地之上海，若干市立學校蛻變爲私立學校，若干內地學校僑置上海爲半公半私之學校，於是原校與新校之間，適應環境而名稱不盡相同，因時間空間之遷變而人員又不盡相同，乃發生正統或僭據之爭焉。然凡參預此項爭執之學校，大多亦各有其根據，或曾保存簿籍，藉資物證；或集原有人員，表示統緒；或且因完備立案手續，自認爲證件充足，可以壓倒對造。其實此等執持，祇係學校局部之史績，未必即爲繼承校之根據。原校既已陷入停頓狀態，則未經奉令遷徙或重設者，未可以有關係之私人集合，即認爲原校之繼續。即使主管機關因特殊關係而有是項假定，則被假定者係整個學校機關，決非爲現在主持此機關之私人。然而今茲所見者，豈眞學校之爭？亦惟爲私人之爭而已。故目前三數校之所謂正統與僭據之爭執，其內容實至空泛也。</p>
<p>且正統與僭據之爭執，事實上非必要者也，誠使主管機關果有此假定，則何者法律根據充足，祇須主管機關一言而定，是非黑白，俄頃而辨，其爭執果何所爲？今茲三數校絕不顧慮此點，仍斤斤各執一詞，一若其所以參加爭執者固有恃而無恐，或且以爲其所爭執者竟足以轉移主管機關夙昔之所假定，故目前之是非，竟可不問。然則推其所爭，表面上爲正統與僭據之問題，實則竟在正統與僭據問題之外，蓋所爭者乃人事之畛域，特藉正統問題作表面之掩護而已。換言之，以正統問題之爭，乃以派別門戶爭論爲實質者也。</p>
<p>派別門戶之見，爲社會人事問題上極普遍之現象，敎育決非孤立於社會以外之事業，當然亦未能免此。特最近兩年來，上海敎育界支撐危局於凄風苦雨之中，耕耘多而收穫少，故無須有此爭端；迨及近頃，學校事業迅速發展，收穫已不似過去之儉嗇，於是爭端迭見，然而今日之中國，猶未脫離最艱險之歷程，全國統一戰綫猶不容發生絲毫之罅漏。敎育界爲知識先進，豈不深明此義？然則姑置敎育本身問題不論，苟爲國家民族着想，則今茲區區之糾紛，不且可以息爾乎？</p>
<p>爲三數學校計，目前所應注意者；一，與其斤斤於正統問題之爭執，不如努力於自身之充實，一方面憑眞實成績取得社會之信任，一方面以合法手續，確立自身之法律地位，繼承公校之系統固善，爲一完善之立案私校亦未嘗不善。二，與其相互譏彈，不如相互合作，捐棄成見，不分派別，在統一戰綫鐵則之下，共同完成抗戰建國之敎育大業。</p>
<h3>外蒙邊境奪陣地　日蒙軍炮戰猛烈　諾曼亨高地成一片焦土　蒙砲隊陽威彈幾無虛發</h3>
<p>路透社特派員七日滿蒙邊境前方電　海拉爾束爭執區域中之諾曼亨高地今日已成兩軍間之「無人地」、外蒙及日本軍隊、均向之開砲轟擊、經三日之戰鬥、日軍已佔領哈勒欣河東最重要之蒙軍陣地、並獲得渡口數處、蒙方步兵輔以砲隊、則猛烈從事抵禦、記者今日在柯斯登格爾與哈勒欣兩河交叉處附近、目擊雙方砲戰、因日軍亟欲在該處架設橋樑也、蒙軍砲隊之射程及方向均極準確、記者在砲火漸趨猛烈時、曾被迫離去瞭望之處、日本飛機全日甚爲活躍、曾屢次轟炸蒙軍砲兵陣地及交通路綫、記者目擊某處蒙古村落完全被燬、當時烈燄飛騰、居民四處奔逃之情形、甚爲悽慘、又見日方轟炸機在柯斯登格爾及哈勒欣兩河交叉處附近連續投彈、蒙軍未開高射砲轟擊、記者在前綫兩日、祇見蒙軍飛機經過日軍陣錢一次、飛行甚高、略作盤旋後、卽行飛回、據日軍宣稱、戰事開始後之三日中、已俘獲對方兵士一百人、並奪得坦克車十輛及若千輕重機關槍等、記者曾見俘虜一小批、內有蘇聯兵士數人及蒙兵一人、惟不能與之接談、此間一般人皆信現有大批蘇聯援軍由西伯利亞各駐防地開至前方、目下大雨妨碍交通、氣壓甚低、故飛機活動因而减少、各種情形皆暗示目前之戰事、仍將繼續延長、</p>
<p>日方戰報</p>
<p>（東京）據日方戰地消息、任諾蒙亨附近日空軍根據地之指揮者爲加藤中校、本年四月閒大型飛機「興克爾」號由柏林飛至東京時，加藤中校曾爲該機主任駕駛員、今在諾蒙亨區域從事邊界空戰、至爲活動、親率機隊出戰、聞六月二十七日擊落蘇蒙飛機九十七架與七月四日擊落敵機五十三架兩役、皆由加藤中校督戰云、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>日蘇間仍保持　正常外交關係</h3>

<h3>蘇聯籌備舉行　砲兵戰術競賽</h3>

<h3>日海軍武官　指摘租界當局　盼望租界與組織合作　對法院事竟謂最不愉快</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日本海軍武官野村海軍中將、於昨日（七日）招待新聞記者席上、對於歷時兩載之在華「不宣之戰」以及上海公共租界狀態、發表長篇言論、籲請公共租界官憲承認「市府」爲此間事實上之當局、野村宣稱、吾人欲公共租界當局承認南京「維新政府」及上海「市府」、吾人察覺公共租界當道及他方面有堅不理會此華方新行政機關之趨勢、長此以往、則公共租界及他方面與華方行政機關間之合作、頗爲困難、此乃承認實在事態、而非盲然翕服謂無此等機關存在之問題云、</p>
<p>日方承認僞組織爲　事實當局</p>
<p>或詢渠是否承認「維新與市府」爲日方之機關、野村答、此乃日方政策、由華人管理華人之結果、惟野村復闡明云、日政府不承認「維新與市府」、然「日本陸海軍領袖承認彼等爲事實上之當局、迨新「中國政府」成立時、日政府將予承認、日方所欲者、爲公共租界當局與此「政府」會同工作、固不必在法律意義上承認之、一</p>
<p>對兩租界華方法院　最不愉快</p>
<p>野村轉述公共租界之華方法院云、此爲「蔣政權」之機關、受蔣氏命令而辦理與日本或日人有關之案件、此殆日軍所不能容忍者、法院之治權、應移交日方、公共租界當局拒不准許移交、抑且爲法院聲援、日方對於工部局撲減公共租界中恐怖主義之努力、頗表謝忱、惟法院至少仍爲最不愉快之現象、」</p>
<p>竟稱蘇州河之南岸　爲敵對區</p>
<p>恢復公共租界常態之努力、進行已非一日、日方與共他當道合作之各種障碍、亦已移除、故可望不久恢復常態、然蘇州河以南長此維持敵對區之現象、以及蘇州河南岸當局與日方長此缺乏合作、則無條件恢復蘇州河北岸常態之問題、頗爲困難、若兩區中之一、並無改進、則另一區亦不能有所改進、</p>
<p>日本全國家家戶戶　感受痛苦</p>
<p>野村轉談、「不宣之戰」問題云有存「因未宣戰、故眞、如常」之意者、即大局不能改善的原因之一、例如日本派出作戰士兵逾百萬人、已死或傷者、盈千纍寓、日本遍國、家家戶戶、無不感受戰爭影響、若謂未宣戰、故情况如常、不亦謬乎、」</p>
<p>戰事延長兩國疲憊　亟盼結束</p>
<p>至是有詢宣戰若僅爲一種手續、則日本何弗宣戰、答曰、日木乃爲自衛、而對蔣政權作戰、非對中國人民而戰、故未宣戰、或詢渠信戰事將歷多久、野村答、戰事不僅使兩交戰國疲憊、且其他任何人俱然、故可望不久結束、然須視戰事中之他國而定、</p>
<h3>匯劃貼水　係不正當交易　銀錢等各行莊決不經營　四行此後不維持貼現率</h3>
<p>關於匯劃貼水問題、財政部曾電囑嚴予取締、市商會及銀錢兩業公會、僉主各同業對存戶要求支付匯劃款項、非一致切實限制辦理、殊不足以杜流弊、所以對於無論定期·活期·存款、除公司分號確因商業上需要、得付給同業滙劃外、其餘私人堂記、概不予絲毫通融、如此範圍較狹、金融可望保持常態、貼現之風、不致愈釀愈厲、今新匯劃制度實行後、匯劃可匯至內地採辦土貨、已與現鈔同樣行使、不應再有貼現之舉、因欲以匯劃票據貼現在投機外匯交易、昨據新聲社記者向銀行業·錢業·錢兌業·三公會探悉、凡三公會之會員行莊、决不經營此匯劃貼水不正當營業、同時中中交農四行此後决不再維持是項貼現率、並希望非會員之一般小錢店及銀號公司、切勿作此不正當營業、而助長投機之勢、違背政府金融政策、及引起金融業之不安、事關同業之切身安危、且與匯劃票據原旨不符、</p>

<p>檢查委會委員推定</p>
<p>各行莊向銀行準備會領用同業滙劃、總額爲國幣五千萬元、業已流通市面、各業咸稱便利、關於組織滙劃準備檢查委員會事、今上海市商會推徐寄廎。錢業公會推秦潤卿。洋商銀行公會推何伯司根。銀行公會已內定吳蘊齋。中中交農四行合推代表一人、俟各團體等代表完全推出後、即行成立、首次匯劃準備檢查、定七月底舉行、屆時將領用數額及擔保品種類數額、分別公吿、</p>
<p>需要時再發滙劃證</p>
<p>關於發行匯劃證事宜、新聲社記者昨向銀行準備會探悉、自領用同業匯劃實施之後、頗收成效、同業滙劃授受、毫無困難、至發行滙劃證原爲便利同業滙劃之授受、故認爲目前並不需要　再發滙劃證、惟滙劃證之發行簡則草案、業已擬定、嗣後如需要發行、再將該簡章草案交常務委會通過施行、該草案規定匯劃證票面金額、分五百元。一千元·伍千元·一萬元·四種、</p>

<h3>淪陷各關實施困難　禁品不給外匯　並不准用郵包轉口非淪陷區　紙業要求通融中途停頓各貨</h3>
<p>財政部頒佈禁止進口貨品辦法後、總稅務司已奉令轉飭各地海關遵照辦理、今除淪陷區域各關、因情形特殊、未實施外、其他各關、均已於命令到達之日實行、但應禁之貨停供外滙、並不准轉口、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>應禁之貨停給外匯</p>
<p>禁止進口之貨品、包括奢侈品。半奢侈品。非必需品、總計有十八組二百三十四稅則、如洋酒·白糖·罐頭食物·葷食·菓品·菜疏·酒·啤酒·燒酒·飮水·菸草·以及玩具絲織品·毛棉織品·木材·紙張·竹木·籐器·土石製品等、今非淪陷區域各地海關、均已嚴格實施、而淪陷區域因權力不及、實施困難、但是項應禁之貨品、中國政府不予供給法定外滙、祗有向黑市塲購買外滙、同時絕對禁止轉口</p>
<p>禁用郵包進口轉口</p>
<p>至非淪陷區域糜禁之貨物、凡用郵包由外洋寄遞進口、或由本國口岸寄遞進口、或由本國口岸寄遞轉口、均在禁止之列、惟如因調劑後方市價供給特種用途、或有其他正當原因、經政府機關核准者、得由財政部査酌實際需要、核發購運特許證、上項禁止辦法實行後、能挽回國際收支之逆勢、整個貿易之入超、能逐漸减少、同時日本貨物、無法再向中國鉅量傾銷、套取外滙之計劃、亦無法實行、</p>
<p>紙業要求通融辦理</p>
<p>上海紙業，以財政部公佈禁止進口物品辦法中、一部份紙類、亦在禁止進口之列、但該業於該項辦法公佈前、在上海·香港。兩地、曾有大宗紙張、運往海防、轉運昆明、因海防運輸困難、故堆置該處三四個月者有之、八九個月者有之、若果該貨一部份在禁止之列、待到達昆明、海關不准進口、損失甚大、巳由該業轉函總稅務司、詢問對於上述情形、海關有無補充辦法、如簽證一類手秋使停頓中途之貨、得以分別辦理、</p>
<p>必需之品儘量供給</p>
<p>關於必需品之進。各貨、財政部准許供給法定外滙後、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、外滙審核委員會業已在重慶成立、各業如欲申請外滙、必須依照部令辦法、向重慶該會申請、聞運入之地點、限於非淪陷區域、並須繳納法價與中交兩行掛牌價格差額之平衡費、至於上海黑市塲外滙、仍由英商櫃豐銀行暫時維持、惟限制掉期、防止投機者之操縱、</p>
<h3>法國國慶　慶祝程序　與去年相同有盛大操演</h3>
<p>大陸報云、法租界刻正準備於七月十四日慶祝法國第一百五十週年國慶日、苦力數百人、已在工作中、霞飛路之法捕房、與公董局大厦、業已點綴有旗杆與燈綵、因中國現局之故、法當局於去歲未舉行循例之大規模慶祝、而本年之慶祝、復將如是、但此僅就公衆之慶祝而言、法僑及其友好仍將舉行歡宴與招待會、慶祝程序、與往年同、首於星期五日淸晨、在法總領事署舉行升旗典禮、晨間、法國公園中將有盛大操演、法捕房部隊與本埠法駐軍均將參加法總領事署法國總會與法國拍球總會中、將舉行正式招待會、而尤以法國拍球總會中者爲最盛大而熱鬧、入夜、該總會中將有循例舉行之跳舞會、</p>

<h3>瑞輪新安利駛定　日艦勒令折回　買辦旅客十餘人在岱山被扣　頭日艦勒令停駛折回上海</h3>
<p>瑞商瑞豐洋行之新安利輪、於本月六日由滬開往定海、兼灣岱山，但七日抵岱山時、買辦董某及旅客等十六人被扣、該輪則仍折回上海、定海籍搭客數十人、均原輪回滬、向公司交涉退票、各情如下、</p>
<p>新安利輪旅客被扣</p>
<p>舟山羣島之岱山沈家門定海等處、先後被日軍登陸盤據後、所有行駛滬定甬定綫之外商輪隻、如哈納。高登。天寳．等輪、均經停航、乃在此交通完全阻斷之時、有所謂瑞商瑞豐洋行者、租用馬勒行之安利馬勒輪一艘、定名爲新安利輪、行駛滬定航綫、並兼灣岱山、據聞事前曾與日方商妥、並由岱山僞「維持會會長」黃伯和保證通航、該掄於本月六日、首次山滬開航、於七日駛抵岱山東沙角、即行拋錨停怕、當時有岱山籍旅客十三人、遂改搭駁船登陸、詎竟爲岱山日軍加以扣留、輪方當派買辦董某、及譯員等前往解釋、亦遭一律扣留（一說已獲釋放）、一面日艦派兵登輪搜查後、迫令他駛、不得在該處返留、</p>
<p>阻止泊定原輪折回</p>
<p>當時該輪主持人、尙攙往訪僞「維持會長」黃伯知、要求疏通、詎黃某不在岱山、據謂已往定海「公幹」故該輪隨即啟椗駛往定海、詎將近定海銜頭時、突又遭日艦阻止、勒令停駛、盤查一過後、囑即駛回上海、所有旅客、亦被拒絕登陸、該輪無奈、祇得原輪折回、業於昨晨十時左右到滬、在黃浦江中浮筒停泊、所有定海籍搭客數十人、莫不寃聲載道、紛向公司交涉退票云、據大光社記者探悉、該輪今後是否再行開航、現尙未定、</p>
<h3>英總統　赴威海衛消夏　比大使亦赴華此</h3>

<h3>通海情形混亂　戰事迄今未停　三廠如家襲擊華軍陣地　華軍一營力抗爭奪四次</h3>
<p>據航業界消息、日軍數度企圖進犯海門未逞後、六日晨在水陸兩路聯合攻擊下、向海門進犯、華方駐軍早有準備、分頭迎擊、展開激戰、迄今戰事未停、</p>
<p>三廠日軍聯合東犯</p>
<p>蘇北通海各地、速日戰事迄未停止、五日忽有日軍部隊二百餘人、挾銳利新式武器、由偽警及僞自衛團作前導、分三路驅鐵甲車四輛、坦克車二輛、沿通海公路前進、會同退駐三廠日軍六十餘人東犯、從側面襲擊湯家鎭。玉龍橋。顧家園。等處華軍陣地、日艦自新港口外發砲轟擊、隆隆砲聲、不絕於耳、</p>
<p>華軍一營衝鋒肉搏</p>
<p>訪地駐守華軍、僅某縱隊之某團一營、雖衆寡懸殊、惟全營官兵、奮勇異常、由營長指揮出壕作白刃戰、衝鋒數次、前仆後繼、陣地失而復得者四次、以工事已遭日軍砲火轟毀、且有被包圍之危、乃相率退守口口鎭四鄉、加以整理、補充實力、</p>
<p>形勢惡劣日軍退守</p>
<p>而日軍此役頗重、僞自衛團一大隊、多携武器、於臨陣時竄散、日僞軍鑒於形勢惡劣、於六日深夜仍退守三廠、現餘西三餘鎭方面、正在惡戰中、情形混亂、</p>
<h3>浙東海面　日艦減少　沿海又被轟炸　錢江戒備頗嚴</h3>
<p>頃據航業界消息、目下浙東海面日艦、已見减少、但溫州樂淸玉環洋面、仍停泊有日艦七八艘、定海洋面有日艦三艘、除不時在沿海各地轟擊外、並無變化、故浙東各地情形、尙稱安謐、</p>
<p>日機轟炸</p>
<p>航業界探悉、七日日轟炸機十二架、分批在浙東沿海鎭海慈谿等處投彈轟炸、損失情形床詳、鎭海瀝港洋面、七日晨到日艦三艘停泊、尙無異動、</p>
<p>錢江戒備</p>
<p>錢江方面、連日雖時有日艦往來、但並無任何舉動、現杭州灣停泊有日艦五艘、華軍在錢塘江南岸、戒備頗嚴、</p>
<h3>糧商續訂　西貢洋米　計六百噸現已啟運　米價回跌來源趨增</h3>
<p>上海民食問題、前因有人操縱、致售價騰漲、竟破二十四元大關、人心忐忑不定、升斗小民、受累匪淺、蓋際此靑黃不接之時、雖內地存底趨减、加以禁阻米糧出口、來源不無影響、幸滬市米糧、經大量採購囤積、存底</p>
<p>極度豐厚</p>
<p>估計尙有六七十萬包左右、足供全市三月之需、故整個民食、無庸憂慮、况最高白米及中次各米、均經租界當局及米業團體訂定限價、新聲社記者昨向達孚洋行探悉、關於訂購洋米一節、前曾　洽成交大批洋米、復因外滙緊縮、　脚倍增、以致去電回退、茲滬市少數　食商人、再行委託　孚洋行、代訂西貢洋米若干、俾便運滬調節、現已成交</p>
<p>一號西貢</p>
<p>洋米六百噸、約六千包（大包）、至於售價、與滬市米糧限價無甚參差、聞每包二十一元、業已由西貢裝輪啟運、約於七月底到滬、前日國米來源趨增、計河下五六船、水陸三四千包、合計在一萬包左右、頃因暑天已屆、市塲人心轉穩、囤戶罷手、市價回跌、上午市塲共成交約三千多包、</p>

<p>禮和洋行船務部之謀福輪、已於昨晨四時、自滬駛鎭海、德平輪則並未開出、茲述如左、</p>
<p>謀福駛甬</p>
<p>謀福輪於昨晨四時、載客二百名、及客貨等、離滬駛甬、照預定當日午後三時餘、抵鎭海口外之七里鎭洋面停泊、晚五時起、即由上班雇定行駛寗波內河之甬安小輪、拖帶駁船、從堵口處之　隙駛出口外、駁運客貨進口、再在鎭海碼頭、換由吃水較深之景升小輪、拖帶至甬、自甬裝滬土產、亦同樣駁上該輪裝滬、</p>
<p>駁運情概</p>
<p>寗波防守部、對老弱婦孺已准出口、發給通行證、且較襄時爲便、故該輪今番來滬、當有大批旅客載來、該輪鑒於旅客轉輾駁卸、於行李頗難照顧、故已訂有行李聯運辦法、無論自滬至甬、或自甬來滬、均由輪方負責、母須旅客自行照顧、至德平輪咋日並未駛甬、因尙在請准中、預定十一日開駛、</p>

<h3>綸昌工潮　談判已成僵局　「罷工費」五十萬之可笑　「破壞份子」應負其全責　—工人與廠方均無問題—</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨日（七日）聞諸可靠方面、浦東英商綸昌廠中之勞工爭執、尙無合理解决之望、僅綸昌公司與工人始能立即和解彼等之齟齬、然「破壞份子」輙妨害公司與罷工者間進行之磋商、實際上公司巳同意工人所提一切條件、僅其一除外、目前談判已成僵局、公司迄今加以拒絕之顯著爭點、厥爲「要求」以「罷工期間所費」</p>

<p>給予工人、公司人員認此「要求」頗可笑、並謂罷工者何能費此鉅款、實屬費解、再、公司方面已確切述明其態度、拒不「資助」煽動者挑起之罷工、工人要求之另一條件、爲增加工資什二、公司對此實已同意、蓋公司已向工人提議計劃、使若輩之工資、月增百分之十九也、工人要求之其他二條件、甚至於罷工之前、即已實行、</p>
<p>此兩條件</p>
<p>爲（一）僱工結婚後、休假一週、（二）懷孕女工臨褥時、休假一月、據報吿上項消息者批評罷工事云、綸昌印花廠中少數工人、要求加薪、五月初實行罷工、此一部份之罷工、至六月十日、即丁格勒被攻擊、繼而殞命十天後、演成總罷工、同時、綸昌紡織廠、亦於五月二十日發生罷工、顯係浦東之「破壞份子」從中挑起、</p>
<p>此次罷工</p>
<p>與煽動者期在紡織廠中開始總罷工、直接導成丁格勒之被攻擊、ｉ幀六月十日起、紡織廠與印花廠均吿停工、記者詢問工人被綸昌公司所僱俄籍守衛者惡待、是否屬實、據供給上項消息者答、此係無稽之指摘、指摘之起由或因居住浦西之工人、常爭先乘公司供給之舢舨渡江、而在江濱與守衛者起爭執、守衛者爲防舢舨肇禍起見、常</p>
<p>須使舢舨</p>
<p>不得載客過多係安全辦法、决不能謂爲惡待工人、據稱不與煽動者聯合之工人、即不得返廠工作、而公司方面自封閉兩廠以還、亦已受巨大損失云、按綸昌印花廠、設立於一九二七年、備有最新式之設備、一九三四年、綸昌紡織廠亦在</p>
<p>浦東成立</p>
<p>備有紗錘四萬四千錘、織機一千一百三十架、每週能製布匹六十八萬碼、此次罷工工人共三千人、內紡織廠工人二千三百人、印花廠工人七百人、前者多女工、後者以男工佔大半、</p>

<p>成立和解</p>
<p>共條件（一）爲張國美應與童振遠同居於海防路海防邨一　十四號、（二）童振遠應保守法律上之一夫一妻制、（三）童振遠每月給付張國美生活費一百元、（四）童不得對張有虐待行爲、（五）張國美如遇窒振遠有違反和解條件時、得返至新閘路九二九弄三號居住、該案</p>

<h3>銀價跌勢轉緩</h3>
<p>七日倫敦電、銀市投機家賣出、印度少數買進、市面平、收盤後仍平、有少數想照掛牌價低〇六二五買進、但照掛脾交易亦有做開、大條銀近期續跌〇六二五、遠期則無上落、紐的銀電、美現貨未更、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平靜、現貨與七月均縮三安那、八月亦降五安那、成交單共計一百五十張云、</p>

<h3>證券　第七次本息謎之又謎　公債市塲人心不定</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况、人心稍有忐忑不寗之象、初開行市、丙種已破進九元內、後以協大同裕等拉抬、仍至六日收盤原價、且會過之、收盤略見鬆軟、此其所以上下不定、都爲第七决本息問題、已成市塲討論之謎、各方消息、雖有照付之說、但至今部方尙無確實表示、如照付本息、原無所用其表示、但有上决路透社之一電、而孔部長新近發表之財政宏論、幷未提及內債、一般人又以爲弦外之音、頗有可疑、茲又據市上多數傳說、政府對於此决到期應付之第七决公債本息、原意暫行停止、以昭中外一律、但經左右請求、允暫由四行代做押款、其詳細辦法、尙未釐定云、記者秉有聞必錄原則、姑作人云亦云、以待事實之證明、總之、在此恍惚迷離之際、任何人不能作肯定語、依前傳有改訂辦法之說證之、不爲無因矣、總之、路透電之說、已是謎、本息付不付又是謎、大家以爲謎、至今不肯揭穿此謎、則爲謎之又謎、其賣大投機與小投機、均是利用機會耳、昨日經過、聯和先出後進、天生先進後出、已見恍惚、初開時潤利仁昌等賣出丙種、退入九元關、後以協大同裕同廣順亨等絡續買進、同順興元及二十五號則供出頗多、致收盤價與前無甚榮辱、甲乙戊略好二三角、丙種無上落、丁種小一角、高低互見、動盪無定、成交數的五十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲　六〇四〇　六〇〇〇　六〇四〇　漲〇·三〇</p>
<p>統乙　五一二五　五〇九〇　五一二五　漲〇·二五</p>
<p>統丙四九七〇　四八九〇　四九六〇　平</p>
<p>統丁　四八九〇　四八六〇　四八七〇　跌〇·一〇</p>
<p>統戊　四九三五　四八七〇　四九三五　漲〇·二〇</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大中華火柴公司股六十股、價爲十二元五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所、昨日股市仍無大變動、但潛勢良好、而交易呆滯、怡和股續穩定、成交十八元八角、會德豐股略有需求、價三十五元、電話股仍形進展、漲至十一元七角、電力五釐半公債略漲、價八十二元、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月七日（週五）掛牌行市、各股均告平穩、行市亦站定不動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月七日（週五）掛牌行市、僅湖廣鐵路公債各跌一鎊、非德發有印債票價爲十五鎊、德發有印債票價爲十三鎊、其餘均無變動、克利斯浦公債行市賣價爲二十二鎊、照市猶撳落半鎊、英倫實貨求售、計津浦原借款英發五千鎊、售價十三鎊、照市抬一鎊、叉中法美金五釐公債五千鎊、（即美金二萬五千元）售價四十二鎊半</p>
<h3>糧食　麵粉明定暗鬆　新麥日商續收</h3>
<p>麵粉　咋現粉市塲、續趨沉寂、查客帮交易、擯持以來、業已多日、近日雖有零星點綴、迄無整批成交、此皆受現鈔問題之影饗、蓋廠盤依然擯守四元六角半之現鈔、祗有回籠貨數百包之交易、乃售五元左右之匯劃、無形中已較廠盤暗鬆數分至一角耳、咋聞北洋帮略有取辦、連同本街零批交易、併計的有二萬包之成交、市面前途、仍鮮特殊之變化、麵粉今日有九十包、運往靑島、</p>
<p>小麥　昨新小麥來源不多、到貨仍以京鎭蘇丹等處爲大宗、目下各產地售價旣難回鬆、、又必須現鈔辦貨、故販運者遠不若往日之閙熱、是以售手扳持、市面允穩、統市售開蘇州大橋麥六元九角、大塲麥八角半、南京鎮江丹陽麥悉爲七角半、成交的計九百包、仍由本街囤戶及日商收辦云、</p>
<h3>粳秈供過於求　價益不支</h3>
<p>杜粳　連跌三日後、昨日本街銷塲愈呆、內地帮亦都旁觀、致售方喊聲更低、各貨跌風未戢、厚薄粳際此天時酷熱之期、棧貨蒸變者又多、故市上籌碼擁擠、呈供過於求之勢、行情又落二角、杜洋尖埠尖去路亦懈、並降一二角、</p>
<p>變元　已成一蹶不振之象、市面又小二角、統計全市到貨、祗來楓涇薄稻近千包、成交數仍不過四千餘石、今日星期、米市塲休業無市、</p>
<p>客秈　邇日又有到頭、惟內地帮辦胃已懈、昨晨且曾一度停辦、旋有小票抑低收買、進價更爲見苛、但貨方售意甚鬆、復有囤戶求脫、行情乃被撳小二角左右、價小後本客始有添辦、故全日成交數仍有三千包之譜</p>
<p>洋米　昨市又形沉寂、緣近日市上一再傳說西貢、二號米定訂不絕、業內外人心頗爲軟弱、而二十三元之現西貢、進戶隨多觀望矣、</p>
<h3>雜量　黃豆漲跌互見</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧市塲、因上日臨時休業、故全日交易頗熱閙、致於黃豆市情、互有漲跌、大連四平街豆因前貶價引胃以來、錫常帮辦胃尙有少數問津、故以市價回升六七分、計成交七車、價自九元六角砌至九元七角、蕪湖豆亦騰五分、由本街辦去一百餘包、價爲九元四角半、惟漢口乍豆在供過於求情形下、續跌六七分、計開一千五六百包、價爲有稅八元六角、送到八元七角、無稅自出價爲八元五角二分至八元五角半、</p>
<h3>南北貨　津紅棗受統制　申貨轉津寄棧</h3>
<p>天津紅棗因爲某方統制產價高漲、而此間行貨以時常霉令、不能久貯、爲免變壞計、會轉往天津寄棧、蓋北方無霉令、適合久棧也、以此申貨漸缺、價遂復緊、昨紅棗王呌售八十元、紅棗頭六十五元、頭戶紅棗五十五元至五十元、二戶三十八九元、</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<h3>紗花　同業心中又看漲　棉紗跌風稍戢　昨日皮球交易佔一千餘包</h3>
<p>紗市始跌繼回、但跌風稍戢、蓋以南華港帮採辦繼續不懈、致人心穩定、且一般實力充足者、復來吸收、又有看漲觀念、因此同業交易特見興繁、至於客銷方面、除香港購買外、其他絕無需要、實則運輸不爽之故也、</p>
<p>現紗情形晨初開盤、受不良環境支配、氣勢怠懈、同行小戶略有吐出、港帮稍有納胃、開盤價跌二三元、二十支雙馬外棧貨爲四百七十七元、棧單價較昂、而買戶不湧、少頃傳言港帮吃量殊强、對於粗紗搜羅不絕、人心激昂、情况驟見緊俏、市價迂緩上升、加之多方某某重整旗鼓、收進棧單現貨有幾百包之巨、檯面陡見乾枯、二十支雙馬外棧貨最高價做至四百八十三元、棧單價爲四百七十七元半、後經獲利者吐出、回挫二元牛、收盤價爲四百八十元〇五角、棧單價爲四百七十六元半、查全日統計一千六百十包、同行皮球交易占一千〇七十包，行情二十支雙馬漲一元、其他平平與上日無甚軒輊、惟二十支收羊漲三元、查棉紗今日有一百三十件、運往天津、又六十五件、運烟台、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　一、〇七〇　香港　四八五</p>
<p>泉州　一一五　內地　三〇</p>
<p>統計　一、六一〇</p>
<p>最後消息，據一部份談論、謂本刋消息、誌八日有大批棉紗出口、將其運往各地之額量統計有三千〇七十包之夥、於是引起投機者之好奇心、議論如此巨量之銷塲、揣測下週市面要看漲價成分占多、所以同業至收盤前買風驟熾、市價由低轉高矣、</p>
<h3>棉花交易停頓　業中盼望銀　行接受押款</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、昨日復形活躍、晨初先因海外棉商之購買及同行大批交易、後因利物浦及孟買來電價高、殊引各方購買、允銀行界爲甚、後市價又因現貨價高而再漲、今日爲美棉新花第一次收穫估計報吿、現各方預測下種者爲二五、四一一、〇〇〇英畝、產額將爲一一、六〇八、〇〇〇包云，昨日紐約漲十四磅音、印度連同預測漲二羅比、埃及漲二十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日趨靜寂、乃因銀根太聚之故、微聞銀行方面、將於下週接受棉花押欵之說，如此說果確、則棉花可略鬆動、惟離大批訂購之期尙遠、最近之到貨、棉商故意托故延期付款、殊爲洋行方面所不滿、聞新交易將款全部付淸後、再簽立成單云、故今後交易困難殊多也、</p>
<p>中外棉花交易杜絕、　者購訂之棉、到貨擁擠、凖備交解、然買方因現鈔缺乏、無法提取、因之對於新買賣完全入於停頓之途、至於本棉來源、僅靠蘇北一路、然額量甚微渺也、昨日碼頭上到通州花五百十包、又北沙來五百六十五包、現棉一筆米成做開云、</p>
<h3>投機家心不死　棉紗市塲圖掙扎</h3>
<p>本埠棉紗現貨市塲、自部令限制提付存款後、市塲頗形紊亂、且有搖搖欲墮之勢、多方鑒於潮流惡劣、藉此機會以事停頓、同業中雖有一度召集會議、結果無甚辦法、暗盤遂開始交易、一般散戶視此情形、稍有了結、市價下瀉、市塲發放謠言、流通券金庫劵之說復盛、言人人殊、買風驟熾、一跳二十元、二十支雙馬復到五百元關口、大宗心理、謂銀行半年决算以後開關出來、當有飛黃騰達之舉、豈料銀錢業之五千萬元之匯劃證、開始登記、金融異常安謐、黃金下落、外匯放長、證券向榮、足見金融安定、一團疑慮頓見冰釋、使多方大爲失望、市盤開出、非但不能膨脹、反見緊縮矣、然一般殷富及銀行之塌戶、始終尙未放棄、故市態軟中帶硬、惟前昨兩日一批小囤戶受柙款之　贖、加之匯劃貼水昂騰、忍痛在市斬結、同時客帮需要濡滯、市面遂成趦趄不前而轉趨下游、頗有江河日下之慨、但大戶心理仍屬看升、謂目前各海口均被封鎖、運輸困難、出路狹隘、將後之希望遠大、因海防改自由港、以後唯一交通、改由麻章運貨（近廣州灣）並說緬甸亦可通運、所以前途仍在樂境、紗銷發展無窮也、然此種理想、深恐與事實尙早、目前就囤戶手中之貨做就押款之紗額量、亦不在少數、且目的等待善價脫卸、大都在高價吸進、日期如久、棧租保險、拆息加重、二則實銷如果不暢、銀根不鬆、廠方昔日開出之貨、期限漸近、勢必催促出貨、屆時或有可能性也、根木問題、還在實際消化上掙扎也、（錦）</p>
<h3>油餅　同業銀期議決　油市轉見繁盛</h3>
<p>豆餅　市塲（前日休業）、今日星期、故賣買集中於昨日、致各種油餅價、大都上騰、計開大連源記餅四千片、價爲三元零六分至八分、雜牌餅一萬餘片、價自三元零四分半、步升至三元零六分半、又妥開天津豆餅一萬片、價爲三元零七分、行情比休市前漲起四五分、</p>
<p>油市　昨日市勢、更見活潑、蓋因同業開賣買、銀期責任問題、已吿議決、（事詳六月二十九日本刋）、由雜糧油餅業同業公會備案維持十天銀期、良以賣買雙方、已有相當周轉餘地、致交易寬展、市價因之向榮、計花生油漲半元、成交膠州生油二百件、價爲三十四元、來倉生油一百件、價爲三十四元四角、大連桶生油一百桶、價爲四十五元、豆油比前市漲八角至一元不等、共開各油二千三四百件、（行情詳市價攔、）去路爲本街內地長江香港等云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　市價向下　廠布加盤　東疋愈跌愈無交易</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨市繼續下游售盤以銀根緊急、一部份散戶手貨降價斬結、突現低盤、惟廠方以成本關係、各貨開價均須照市每疋加一元以上、難以啣接、故多數囤戶均鎭靜如恒、擇廉宜各貨、繼續購囤、因之布價跌風、勢殊徐緩、售盤極形混亂、昨續跌每疋五分至二角五分不等、各路現銷零星、津浦路沿綫堰師商邱徐州各埠辦色布色斜印花直貢嗶嘰二千餘疋、粵帮辦色布色斜花布三千餘疋、細斜二十餘包、滇帮辦色布錢呢嗶嘰二千餘疋、大鵬飛鴻等牌細布斜紋五十包、本街囤戶搜購細斜五六十包、染廠亦購下檔常州貨細斜一百餘包、蘇北各地零疋拆貨交易、成交府綢色布一千餘疋、國外新加坡小呂宋各埠採辦續旺、漂白染色細斜細布、成交一千數百疋、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>白貨細斜市盤、昨仍萎靡下挫、續降每疋一角、至二角外、龍頭細布現貨跌至十三元六角、期貨十三元七角半、同業中人心思多數看疲、故市價愈跌愈無交易、沉悶之局勢、一時尙難開展、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日有疋頭十五件運烟臺、二十件運天津、但由香港運來疋頭兩百件、</p>
<h3>銷令未屆　已起搜羅馬鬃袖　毛冷昨到二十三箱</h3>
<p>馬鬃袖裹、近日來本客咸有搜羅、因鑒於銷令將臨、海上小機戶、自外匯短縮與限制提存後、原料激增法幣頭襯軋缺、多不能似前之發達、此後織製、勢必缺少、故目下多趁先購墊、成交已有百餘疋、價格多守秘密、聞定價二號貨每碼計法幣六角七分半云、</p>
<p>又昨日由香港運來毛冷二十三箱、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖續升</h3>
<p>昨日糖市如二四粗砂本棧貨爲二十九元八角、外棧六角、轉口貨以二十一元四角、成交一千一百包、四角半二百包、此升一角、查荷電八月份八元六角牛、九十月八元二角半、港電粗砂包申爲港幣十元零八角、太B嘜西棧貨三十元零六角、東棧叫角、CW三十元零六角、DY二十九元七角、共成六百包、CX三十元、HX二十九元五角、H赤二十一元五角、各升二三角不一、據倫敦電八月份爲八先令零二五、小一二五、十二月六先令三便士二五、升二五、三月六先令四便士二五、升二一五、荷赤等如前無大更動、國糖計潮帮開出綿赤五十包、成盤二十二元、冰花白四十包、十七元二角、惠州次白六十包、十七元四角、</p>
<h3>五金　鋅皮本釘同上漲</h3>
<p>鋅皮　海外交易未見發展、本街廠家生意亦屬零星、所以全市趨勢殊感滯木、但存底極薄、而新貨無到、所以執貨者心思高便、均懷囤積之念、因此開價異常高昂、如二號每桶售三百元、三叫號則開價三百十元、五號、一百九十五元、六號二百八十五元、七號八號每桶均開二百七十五元、九號二百八十六元、十號二百九十元、其他厚花色則開便自三百元至三百二十元不一、査前昨開出祗二三十桶、其花色係五號九號、買主係電池廠及印書房、其他茶棧香烟廠玩具廠等、除問津外、殊少點綴、</p>
<p>本釘　連日天津帮辦去達四五千桶之多、且本埠囤戶及建築帮等進胃亦健、致廠方出貨不敷分配、且連日原料（如元絲等）異常軋缺、因之聞某某等廠因原料缺乏、有停頓之虞、因此廠方及同業方面、心思均甚高硬、對於沽價、不肯遷就、每桶售盤開二十一元、比上日售盤高出二角五分、聞金融富俗之錢業帮等、近日亦多批定、故市勢踊騰、人氣昂健、</p>
<h3>絲茶　緣茶英法需要不斷</h3>
<p>昨日綠茶、因英法各莊行家、鑒於國外來電需求殷切、又復紛起搜辦、但廠家出貨有限、供不應求、人心堅挺、市價遂有扶搖直上之勢、咋日全市共由協和怡和保昌永興等行、買進抽芯珍眉細針等貨、合計八百餘箱、抽芯開至三百四十八元、統珍開至二百九十元、較前又漲七八元、八日有茶葉三百十件自香港來、</p>

<h3>新都飯店巡視</h3>
<p>— （范蒙）</p>
<p>定於本月十四日開幕　二百餘工匠日夜趕工</p>
<p>新新公司遊藝塲，在一個多月以前。就決定取消原有的遊藝塲，改建現在的「新都飯店」</p>
<p>那時候，我曾和新新公司蕭宗俊先生談過這問題，他的理由是：與其有這麼一處不死不活的普通遊藝塲。還不如改建一個比較適合上流人士行樂的塲合，過去新新屋頂花園，裏面種種設備，他們自己都不滿意，於是決定有這個新都飯店的計劃。</p>
<p>這兩天，據說新都飯店內部工程，已差不多改裝完畢，於是我去訪問了一决新新公司的總經理李澤先生，承他吿訴我新都飯店開慕日期，他說：</p>
<p>「新都開幕日期，已經決定本月十四日，那時候，不預備過份的鋪張。」</p>
<p>李先生又介紹了一位鄭家駒先生，陪着我到六樓新都飯店作了一次全部的巡禮，現在在新都還沒有開幕以前，我在這裏，先爲讀者們勾劃一下簡單的輪廓。</p>
<p>新都飯店這决全部工程費用，據說足足有十萬元以上，牠包含的塲子，六樓計有五種：（一）中菜部及茶室；（二）好萊塢式的玻璃播音室；（三）禮堂；（四）雲裳舞廳；（五）申曲塲。</p>
<p>七樓，也即是屋頂花園，設有西菜部及以葡萄棚改裝的餐問。</p>
<p>除了七樓屋頂花園不裝置冷氣以外，六樓全部都裝有冷氣。</p>
<p>當我們走上六樓的時候，我馬上嗅到一陣强烈刺鼻的「泡力斯」和油漆的氣味，樓板上，各處也堆滿了木屑，木板。據說現在日夜有一二百泥永匠及木工匠在趕工，預定十四日決定如期開幕。</p>
<p>這一開六樓的樓面，是相常開闊高敞的，以我個人佔計，他的地位，並不比大東二樓小。</p>
<p>這一部份雖是茶室，主要却是中菜部，我們參覜的時候，所有桌椅差不多都已佈置妥當了，現在在趕工的，只是中餐部的幾個餐廳。</p>
<p>廣吿餐廳十六間</p>
<p>在新都飯店中別創一格的，也可以算是這些每間各不相同的餐廳。</p>
<p>這些餐廳一共有十六間，每一間餐廳，由每一個商店或廠家自己承包裝置，所以，你換一間餐廳，便好如逛過一家新的商店。</p>
<p>比如這裏有綠寳廳，明星廳，美亞廳，信誼廳等等，內部裝置，不單色調不同，而且佈置式樣也完全不同。</p>
<p>一個新的廣吿家，是隨時隨地能吸引他的主顧的，新都飯店這種廣吿式的餐廳，在廣吿術上，似乎也打出了一條新路。</p>
<p>一間透明播音室</p>
<p>現在讓我們談談玻璃播音室吧：</p>
<p>這間播音室所佔的地位並不十分寬大，但在上海播音業中，有這麽一間透明播音室，的確可算是首創的了。</p>
<p>玻璃播音室在電梯進口的地方，公開播音表演的，計有四個節目：（一）是中午十二時至下午一時二十分，節目是歌唱及舞蹈；（二）下午三時二十分至四時是江笑笑等的滑稽；（三）下午四時至四時四十分女彈詞；（四）下午六時四十分至八時的羣芳會唱。</p>
<p>除了這四個時間以外，其餘播音都不公開的。</p>
<p>而今璇宮改雲裳</p>
<p>我順便又參觀了雲裳舞廳及申曲塲。雲裳舞廳即海立笙率領的璇宮舞廳。它給我的印像，覺得佈置很精緻，但不够高敞。裏面有四隻凹進長的沙發椅子，頗有從前老大華維納斯的風味。</p>
<p>申曲塲就是過去的京劇塲，現在稍加改裝，班底是大家知道的筱文濱。</p>
<p>七樓是屋頂，空氣很流暢，晚上在上面乘乘風凉到很不錯，假如在葡萄棚改裝的餐廳裏看看上海夜景，到也是一件很風趣的事。</p>
<h3>米珠薪桂菜價高　包飯公司應運而生</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>不拘地方遠近都可準時送到　每客自八元起至十多元不等</p>
<p>米一担要二十多元，猪肉一元買一斤四兩，靑菜一角錢買不到一斤。</p>
<p>在這樣的情形之下，上海的人們，住的問題感到苦痛之後，吃飯又發生了問題。就是一個很小的家庭，伙食賬上比戰前的支出至少也得加倍，但錢雖加了一倍，吃的菜却還沒有以前的豐美。</p>
<p>本來自己燒的飯菜，要比吃包飯便宜而可口，但現在可不這樣，似乎吃包飯比較便宜。也許有人會懷疑到包飯作的老闆，不見得不想賺錢，反肯貼本，但我所說的吃包飯，在今日的情形之下，反比自己燒便宜，也自有見地。</p>
<p>就把我自已所體騐到的說來，自己燒飯菜，每月至少要燒去兩担煤球，目前每担的售價是兩元，一共要耗去四元。事情更不這樣簡單，家裏所僱的女傭，至少上半天是忙着買菜，燒飯。不僱女傭，自己的妻子又要燒飯，又要領孩子，委實來不及。也許這女傭大半是爲了燒飯煮菜而僱的。</p>
<p>現在僱一個女傭，工錢至少每月五元，而且在二十多元一担的米價之下，吃恐怕不止，五元，所以僱一個女傭，工資和膳食，每月也要十二三元。吃了包飯吧，雖然飯菜决不會比自己去買來煮便宜，但兩担煤球是可以省下來，而如果人口簡單呢，一個女傭也可省掉。那你的支出項下，每月不是可省去十五六元嗎？</p>
<p>就為了米珠薪貴，朋友中有人爲省僱女傭而想吃包飯，然而大家知道，一般的包飯作，比較不很淸潔的居多。不潔的飯菜，吃下去是影響衛生的，何况現在正常夏令的時節，蒼蠅滿庭亂飛，別人家燒的飯菜，吃下去總有些不大放心。想到了衛生問題，雖欲吃包飯，也會猶預起來，祇有在嚴重的壓迫之下，還是自己燒煮。</p>
<p>然而上海畢竟是上海，現在已有人看到了這一點，開辦一個上海包飯公司，七月一日起開幕了。這個包飯公司，規模比較偉大，而對於衛生也相常注意。你包了飯，不拘地方遠近，都可凖時送到。接洽的地方在成都路四百六十號，每客自八元起到十多元不等。</p>
<p>包飯公司，無疑又是一種新的事業，而這種新事業，可使一般的小家庭省僱女傭，省買煤球，减輕生活負担的嚴重壓迫。但我們唯一的企圖，是希望這包飯公司，眞能做到爲市民謀伙食的節省，生命的安全，所有的飯菜，烹調注意衛生，售價能夠合理。那麽這新事業的前途，凖會有相當的發展的。</p>
<h3>（二）論做事的方法</h3>
<p>— 謝</p>
<p>做事第一件的問題就是要立意純正，宗旨光明正大。純正的宗旨對於人們的行為，猶如靈魂之於內體，形式之於實質，根蒂之於樹幹，太陽之於世界，泉源之於河流，基礎之於棟梁。有肉體而無靈魂，是行尸走肉，有實質而無形式，則樸拙不文，樹幹去了根蒂，便是一根枯木，世界沒有太陽，便黑暗無光；河流沒有泉源，不久便要乾凋；基礎毀壞，棟梁摧拆；立意不正，宗旨不光明，那末，行爲必定卑鄙而無益於人。要立意純正，必須遵行下列幾條建議；（一）在做一件事情之前，必須想到它的結果，並且要認清目的何在。（二）做一件事情，應當奉上帝之名去做，就是（1）一件事情，不合上帝眞理不可做。（2）做一件事情，應當以榮耀上帝為目的；即使暫時看不到榮耀，結果必能榮耀上帝。（3）不可使原琮的一番美意變成了惡意。（三）在着手做一件大事情以前，必須先祈禱，不但求上帝成全你這件事情，而且求上帝把你所做的事情當做禮物獻給上帝。以求上帝的恩典。（四）做事的時候，務須隨時念幾句聖經裏面的話，使我們的純正的宗旨不致改變。例如：「主啊，不要將榮耀歸於我們，但歸於主耶穌」。（待續）上海基督敎文字佈道會郵編一二二七號</p>
<h3>古堡魅影</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>The　Hound　of　the　Baskervilles</p>
<p>二十世紀福斯出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>我曾經讀過不少柯南道爾的「福爾摩期探案」，覺得他在勾劃福爾摩斯和他的助手華生，他兩人的心細如髮，及勇於解人之危以外，作者更在每一件探案中，運用他的科學根據，打破人世間許多看來似乎很神秘的迷信傳說，但是讀者都迷惑於他的寫作技巧，而忽略了作者用意所在。</p>
<p>「古堡魅影」中，白斯克斐爾氏的族人所以被獵大咬斃，大家以爲白氏曾犯過罪案，因此獲得的果報。柯南道爾就通過了福爾摩斯這位大偵探，寫成一個曲折離奇的故事，而最後揭破這案件之所以發生，是有着其他的社會原因的。</p>
<p>銀幕上的「古堡魅影」是頗忠於原作的。</p>
<p>導演者在描寫福爾摩期和華生二個人物，在讀過柯南逍爾原著的我看來，覺得福爾摩斯的烟斗不離手，而故意在緊張的時候，鎭靜地奏他的凡華林，及華生的冒充福爾摩斯等，都彷彿原著上的人物一般</p>
<p>作爲重要的綫索的三件東西：手杖，皮鞋及照像，導演者也都鄭重地介紹它們出塲，而在出塲時候故佈的疑陣，都很高明。如介紹手杖時，他拉出詹姆士醫生來，可是之後的許多戲中，都不見詹姆士出塲，而在最後亨利白期克斐爾回古堡時，才特別寫詹姆士駕馬車先走：介紹皮鞋時，他拉出一個女僕；介紹照像時，他用福爾摩斯的跟鏡頭，表示他已在這照像上發現了什麽。</p>
<p>恐怖氣氛也是一步緊一步，在福爾摩斯和華生揚言回倫敦以後的戲，導演者同時寫着各方面的發展的手腕是値得欽佩的。</p>
<p>本片得力於攝影和音響的帮助也不少。如每個可疑人物出塲時，及荒地的四周環境，都能利用鏡頭角度和光綫來加强恐怖性；福爾摩斯在馬車傾覆後，走小路追蹤時，狗呌的聲音，由遠而近，增加了當時空氣的緊張。</p>
<p>貝錫賴朋斯的福爾摩斯演得沉着有力，化裝後的喉音也變得很自然。其他如尼格爾勃羅斯的華生，里昂安德惠的詹姆士醫生也都努力。</p>
<p>「古堡魅影」可以說是偵探片中的佳作。</p>
<h3>徐繼麟（書）繼鵬（畫）昆仲合作扇頁</h3>
<h3>女彈詞人物誌</h3>
<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>嚴麗貞持平叟接女彈詞小「志，稱女彈詞之以「藝」種者，凡四人：陳芝香，徐寳玉，汪雪卿，嚴麗貞，並逐一加以論評，謂「芝香音淸越而調嫵媚，於四聲七音，辨析入微，其彈詞殆經才子潤色，絕勝傳奇原本，詞雅語雋，聽者神往，刻意描摹，入理入情，維妙維肖，神乎技矣。寳玉浩浩落落，有英雄氣，忽而暗啞叱咜，忽而突梯滑稽，勝於觀劇，出奇制勝，巾幗中別派也。雪卿說白，意周而語簡。麗貞善繪悲咽，無言之處，包咽千萬言。」</p>
<p>於各人藝事，紹介可謂盡詳。四人中，以麗貞名爲最著，調亦最「穩」。邗江詞客曾詠之云：「老輩風流嚴麗貞，登塲一盼似多情。倭袍葷素人爭聽，弦索聲中字字淸，」是亦「穩」之說明也。王弢「海陬冶遊錄」曾爲之傳：</p>
<p>嚴麗貞，姑蘇人。往　冠之亂，轉徙至滬。善南詞，曲中人無出其右。嗣以齒漸長而名益噪，擬出遊以新眼界，歷江浙間二年。乙亥冬，賃居湖郡，登　試唱，聽者神傾，而金翠盈頭，早為匪為所物色。十一月間，賃舟至滬，晚泊烏程縣界。三鼓時，哨聲四起，相顧張皇，則羣盜已露刃立船頭矣。麗貞懼欲投於河，一盜操湖音持之，得不死。然轉瞬間，舟中被擄一空，相繼過他船而去，計値約千五百金。質明，往報地保，擬禀縣勘騐。邑某紳向與麗貞善，聞是耗，亟來慰藉，且勸其無報公庭，蓋以為此輩並非眞盜，或艙船流亞耳。若一具報，原贓萬難復得，徒資擾累。麗貞乃請諸某紳，願於要隘處立柵一座，以利行旅。某紳許之，麗貞遂揚帆回滬。噫喀！以數年歌舞之餘資，竟飽匪徒之壑，悲憤交集，夫復何言？乃猶願不嗚官，而心計後來之弭盜，非深明大體者能若是乎？麗貞後改姓金，易名曰素娟。</p>
<p>此傳側重麗貞爲人，於　事，不若恃平叟盡到。紉秋居士評之爲「曲罷常敎善才服」，極肯當。惟其人並不「麗」，叟會調侃之云：「余嘗語友曰，昔楊龍友謂李貞麗云，麗則有之，貞則未也，嚴麗貞得毋亦然。友曰。恐貞則有之，麗則未也。余訝許貞，則曰，色藝而衰，則不貞將似貞矣。余曰語太尖刻矣。」語誠可謂尖刻，然叟藝事而外之言，殊難决其眞爲持平之論也，畸輕畸重，由於主觀，諒難免耳。</p>
<p>關於芝香，於月娥傳中已有說，「丁丑上海書仙花榜」稱之爲「豪品」，喻之爲「難冠」，評語則極滑稽，曰：「耳際風生，鼻中出火」，其行顯有不爲人所直者。徐寶王事不詳。僅於當時「申報」中獲得白下靑溪生贈詩一首，爲「五詞史詞」之一。詩云：「說透痴人夢欲醒，始知舌妙更心靈。滑稽涉世原非易，何减當年柳敬亭。」大概其人頗善於說「噱頭」。邗江詞客亦有一絕句詠之：「宛轉歌喉一曲新。徐娘半老尙風塵。書樓浪說逢靑睞，誰識當年碧玉身，」惜不及其藝事。汪雪卿則以善說平話稱，王艘會有記：</p>
<p>汪雪卿，善說平話，玉貌珠喉，么絃脆管，眞個令人消魂。日午宵初，常於土地堂羅神廳演唱。聽者聯坐接肱，每發一語，輒爲解頣，富室子弟爭交歡之，皆慮不當意。（五）</p>

<h3>毛劍秋　于桂芬與風流賊事件</h3>
<p>— （玉笛）</p>
<p>各延律師控訴蔣劍秋</p>
<p>共舞台坤旦台柱毛劍秋，最近遭風流賊　蔣劍秋誣擊，在法庭上供述曾與毛劍秋相繾綣，並說毛曾以鑽戒金鐲等飾物贈蔣。（詳見七日本報本市新聞版）毛劍秋與蔣劍秋，同名劍秋，倒也是一件巧事。自此項新聞在報端發表後，毛劍秋曾大哭一塲，後來接得蔣劍秋自獄中寄給她的信，又曾大笑一塲，哭是為了無端遭誣　，笑是認為這事滑稽得出乎意料之外。現在已有兩點可以證明毛劍秋的無辜：第一，蔣劍秋在法庭上供曾於三月十八日與毛劍秋在大方飯店　房間，而在獄中寫給毛劍秋的信，却有這麼的一句：「回憶到你我於四月二日在法國花園結識後」。將日期一核對，「開房間」却在「結識」之前，豈非絕好的反證！第二，據其舞台經理周劍星說：毛劍秋每晚戲畢，輒由其母（毛韻珂妻）伴同回家，而且毛劍秋每日起身極遲，决無清晨遊法國公園（蔣函所述如此）的可能。另有一點，毛劍秋住在蒲石路聖母院路高福里六十一號，蔣函却誤書高德里四十一號。</p>
<p>毛劍秋部份的事旣不可靠，此外于桂芬姚玉蟾兩坤伶，（均已嫁人，于之　砧為王逸公，曾辦過紅星劇塲。姚即以前之緣牡丹，嫁一朱某，人稱朱大鼻子，現同居南京。）當然也是被誣了。</p>
<p>現在于桂芬與毛劍秋，除報告伶界聯合會外，並將延請律師，對蔣劍秋提起誹謗及破壞名譽之訴，于桂芬已由其夫王逸公委託范剛律師辦理，毛劍秋請的是江一平律師。被誣者方面認為蔣劍秋的誣攀，或許有人　使，所以非提起法律訴訟不可。如果因誣攀而加重罪刑，那麼這位風流賊，真是咎由自取了。</p>

<h3>故都戲曲學校高材生　宋德珠卽將來滬</h3>
<p>— 愛萍室主</p>
<p>黃金大戲院自言菊朋，侯玉蘭演畢後，因天氣炎熱，不宜開演平劇，乃暫以電影過渡，下期平角聞已邀妥宋德珠，宋為故都戲曲學校之高材生，自畢業該棱後，即組班（顥光社）出演於故都，以其藝術優越，，頗受各界熱烈歡迎，滬上人士久慕其名，恨不能見，茲宋受聘黃金，即將來滬登臺，必予本市受好顧曲者耳目一新也。</p>
<p>德珠原為武旦專工，嗣因戲校人才缺乏，乃以之兼演花衫戲，其戲路兼宗程（硯秋）尚（小雲）荀（　生）三人，而以尚之成份居最多，荀劇次之，程劇又次之，但其嘗問藝於程荀二人，而與尚之關係極淺，亦奇事也。</p>
<p>德珠旣工武旦，武功自極佳美，出手尤稱一絕，精練火熾，時下　伶中　稱第一，所可惜者，聞其軟功似稍弱於　世善，是則美中不足也。</p>
<p>以做工論之，德珠做作稍欠細膩，花旦戲首重做工，蓋多以表情傳神也，德球於花旦戲研治未深，不足為病，以德珠之天資顥悟，如能習練久之，求其細膩，自非難事也。</p>
<p>德珠之唱，　昔亦欠流利，不善抑揚曲折，不能分剛柔，行腔每覺生疏僵硬，此實因練武功之關係，近則頗勤於調嗓，以期能多演唱工劇，來滬可望走紅，且德珠之扮相秀麗，身長而不幌，雖瘦而不削，實可以「風流」二字稱之也！</p>
<p>去歲玉霜來滬前，一度盛傳德珠將偕之同來，余慶幸歡欣者冉，嗣因他故，未能成行，此番自任主角，來滬獻藝，成績必佳無疑，望其特別努力，毋負海上愛護者之苦心也！</p>
<h3>游藝界同人逸興橫飛</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>勞萊哈台亦相互調笑</p>
<p>各露笑容有如彌陀佛</p>
<p>上海難民救濟協會為勸募衛生經費請游藝界諸君在新新電台播音以廣宣傳，昨由該會袁　登·顧克民·樂拼葆三委員出面，假大西洋西菜社，招待陳歌辛·洪醫鈴·韓　根·劉繼羣·劉子雲·張石用·李昌鑑·等數十人，有電影明星，有說書領袖，有滑稽大家，有話劇先進，一言以蔽之均是吃開口飯的。平素在台上單獨演唱，已能引起觀衆注意，是日其聚一堂，相互調笑一餐。韓蘭根與殷秀岑本有中國勞萊哈台之稱，是日並坐一起，張冶兒問他們身軀大小，何以相去如是之遠？殷謂韓人雖小，出貨的地方太多，無怪入不敷出，而愈弄愈小。韓謂殷貪心不足，能吃三客大菜，不顧主人費鈔，祇知肚皮填飽，所以愈弄愈胖。張冶兒集各人點心內之外國　子，送與韓蘭根，謂此係英國貨，名曰英（英與陰音相似）　，食之能滋補身體請君多食，以免瘦得像一塊排骨。朱耀祥與洪警鈴不相識，經人介紹後，朱謂洪曰：足下之尊容，早在銀幕上看見，所以甚熟，想慕已久，今日始見真面目，三生有幸。洪謂朱曰：老兄的尊音，時常在電台上聽見，清脆悅耳，亦甚相熟，今日始親聆宏論，較之在空氣內尤覺動聽，不勝快慰。余曰你們二君，素昧生平，一則曾見其影，一則僅聞其聲，而皆久慕大名，可稱「音容宛在」，衆皆　渠，何雙呆近來發明電燈泡，正在設法推銷，韓蘭根謂近來正在拍二房東影片，余　二房東，持電燈泡與三房客，你如贈我一打，則余謂三房客曰，雙呆燈泡用電最省，否則告以　呆燈泡用電甚費，一字之差，　貶懸殊，僉佩其　敲竹槓，席間笑話甚多，限於篇幅，不克詳載。總之此兩句　內，數十人皆大歡喜，各人面部，　如彌勒佛一般，如攝入　頭，亦十足喜劇也。</p>
<h3>夏令配克舊址　重建新型電影院</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>在上海的電影史上，靜安寺路卡德路口的夏令配克大戲院，資格可算很老的，據說還是放映有聲電影的第一家。但不知為什麼，聲片風盛之後，這戲院在同業競爭之下，營業竟日見清淡，終至一蹶不振，停辦至今已有七八年之久了。</p>
<p>「八一三」以後，租界上擠進無數難民，所有的空屋，被佔殆盡，而夏令配克大戲院內，也當做收容所了。直到最近，難民才遷出，並且全部的房屋，正在大事改建，連得門口的天面也都拆去了。這戲院裝修過後，將重振旗鼓，再度營業。不過名稱是否改變，目前還沒有確實的消息。也許為了「孤島」發生擠居問題之後，娛樂皆大發財，新興了不少電影院，所以關閉多年的夏令配克，這時候老店新聞，獲利當然十拿九穩的。</p>
<p>又訊，夏令配克大戲院，現經遠東公司興工重建，擬造一新型電影院，開映第一輪西片，座位可容一千二百人，據承造該院的外籍建築師說：新院將力求現代化，特別注意座位的設計，務使觀衆適舒滿意，十月中旬可以落成云。</p>
<h3>熔納凉娛樂於一爐　滄洲設露天影戲塲</h3>
<p>— 佩佩</p>
<p>露天影戲塲在上海，已有甚久的歷史。過去的大華與花園，都成了陳跡，大華飯店原址，現在夷為一片平地，花園的原址，也由工部局改為兒童樂園。碩果僅存的，祇有滄洲露天影戲塲一家，碧油油的草地，四方寬敞的塲址，在老上海的心目中，曾留下深刻的印象。這次重整旗鼓，在悶熱的週遭中，建設最理想的納凉勝地。選映的影片，是美國二十世紀編斯華納派拉　三公司出品，據說選片，非常嚴格，都是超特或是優異的作品。在滬西的住宅區，像這樣切合時令的露天影戲塲，的確是非常迫切需要的，就是經營這塲合的主持人，也顯有尖銳的目光。昨日正式開幕，觀光的人非常衆多，大家認為納凉觀影，一舉兩得，是暑夜消遺的好去處。每晚開映兩塲；七時半與九時半，座價非常大衆化，祇　大洋三角與四角云</p>
<h3>閒畫游藝界</h3>

<p>朱彜尊的靜志居詩話上說：「梁辰魚子伯龍，崑山人，擅詞曲。時邑人魏良　能喉囀音聲，伯龍　浣紗記付之。」此　腔之由來也。</p>
<p>這玩意，過去也曾風靡一時，士大夫階級爭趨之。年來歌國風氣大變，　曲越劇之類唱詞粗淺的，都走上了紅運；這調調兒却反為文縐縐而見棄於時人。陽春白雪趕不上下里巴人賣錢，自古已然，非自今日始也！</p>
<h3>溜冰術（七二）</h3>
<p>— 蓮君琦珍合編</p>
<p>四邊　三·外退用鞋之外邊退後行，身宜仰後，不宜俯前，客腿在前推動後，漸移至後面，客肩與之俱轉，視綫　行動方向。外退最難而最重要者，即開步宜自立定始，客　推動後，離地須緩和而不宜急促，並切忌在主足之後成鈎形，最好面對將欲盡之圈而立，重心在客足，即欲推動之足，右足移在前，離開六英寸至八英寸，足趾向外，客腿大屈，客足用力在裹邊推動，但不宜急促，其迫隨主足。愈久即愈妙。</p>
<p>當全圈約過三分之一時，肩起始旋動，客肩在圈外，此種身之旋動，約佔全圈之半，客肩臂腿臀隨頭同時旋轉，直至全身旋至下次閒步之地位。再在客足用裹邊推動未畢時，即隨身漸漸旋轉，隨在主足之後，半推半拖，則不僅能使客足離地時之姿態雅觀，且能便邊得力。</p>
<p>此種外退開步法學習固難，但一經學會，速而有力，彌可　也。（外退圈為長家最速之步法）</p>
<p>第二步開步法　當一圈未終止前，腿臂肩頭均隨行動方法旋動，當第一圈將終止時，客腿客肩之回搖，能使全身重力暫移至裹　邊，同時主腿挺直，此一剎那間之位置，正與第一圈開步時之位置相同，第一步之終與第二步之始並不中斷，且兩步之開步法相同。</p>
<p>又一開步法　將主足先交於客足之後，足尖着地，然後將主足提起，移前，如此即可借力不少，而使開步較易，此法專家多用之。但主足搖前時，客足切不可移動分寸，否則即為犯規，初學者學此步法之通病，即在主足提高時，常在地上一推，而使客足移動，致遠開步須自立定始之章程，故初學者仍宜學第一法。</p>
<p>再者當客足推動，與身體旋動時，目之視向先須對正圈之中心，愈久愈好，然後使首與客半身旋動到塲之中心，待第二步又欲開步時，再向第二圈之中心看，即此旣不致失形，又易注意行動方向，不易與他人相衝，以上是用身之位置第一第二兩式。</p>
<p>第三第四兩式，雖在高級溜冰時所用，但亦宜同時練習之，開步後用第三式，腰部以上與第一式相反，因客腿留於前，客肩客臂即移後，高級溜冰於（甲）後退環結之前，（乙）外進反搖轉之後，及（丙）外退三字轉之前，多有用此式者。</p>
<p>第四式腰部以上與第二式相反，因客肩客臂在前，客腿在後，高級溜冰如（甲）外退反搖轉之前。（乙）外退反三字轉之前均用之。以上四式身之位置，均須同時用全圈練習，直至學會為止。</p>

<p>所以，現在雖是假期了，然而爲了要繼續過往對於學業的精神，或是補救今日以前在學業上欠下的缺陷，那末，在道說長不長說短不短的兩個月的假期中，你不能，也是不可以百分之百地把大好的光陰平白地虛擲過去的。在這裏，固然用不着拿古人的「一寸光陰一寸金，寸金難買寸光陰。」這些話來向你說敎，可是事實上，當你還逗留在正是發奮求學的孩童時代，却不能不把光陰重視。是不是呢？過了今天，雖然還有明天來臨，日子好像是永無盡期似的；於是「來日方長」這句成語正不知陷害了或是躭誤了多少人的學業與前程！要知道，等待明天很容易，但，回轉頭去抓回昨天是不是也容易呢？十分困難吧？不，細細地思量起來，也許使你恐懼，害怕，進而至於在覺醒下有所警惕的。不是嗎？抓不回的昨天，便是葬送你的童年的符號；而在期待中的明天，却是替你迎來老年的抉梯。時間的消逝是淤迅速的，日子的巨輪永恒地在人們不知不覺間努力的進展着，倘使你不重視光陰，用一種勤懇的態度來對付今日，利用今日，把握今日，應付今日；則明日之來到，將今日扔到咋日的行列裏去，在這一轉換之間，你已蒙受了無可計算的損失了。</p>
<p>是這樣，學校的假期，用意固然是給你作爲休息的機貧的，可是你自己，千萬不能也作如此想。兩個月呵，一千四百四十小時，難這眞的就在休息下把它度過了嗎？不！不能！假如你在學校裏是被稱爲優等生的，一切學業部超人一等則趁這假期中，更應該積極努力，加速你的深造，待秋季開學時，你在所有功課上是會比過去更易於運用，易於對付的；不然的話，即使你是個劣等生，那來利用這個假期從事補習，從事探求，也未嘗不可給予下學期學業上的帮助。人類畢竟是理知的動物哩，我想你，一定是不願意永遠落在他人之後的，於是乎，你就須格外爲未來的學業前途加緊預備，在這假期裏。</p>
<p>話雖如此說，不過，你同時也得注意身體上的健康。這意思也就是，在這假期中，希望你每天在適當的時間內抽出幾個鐘點來致力學業，則以多餘下來的時間消暑休息，不也一樣可以調養身心嗎？</p>
<h3>不要讓暑假在遊玩中過去！</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>小朋友們，自從七月三日起，各學校都照章放暑假了，我們不是又要過那暑期生活了嗎？在這個的兩個月的假期里，要是你沒有一個周密的消夏計劃，讓那些非常寳貴的辰光隨隨便便地溜去，那眞是太可惜的。學校里大慨都有「假期作業」發給你們吧，對於這些「作業」，我們必定要切切實實地做去，尤須注意的，就是大家務須擬定一個怎樣過暑期生活的計劃，不要將光陰都浪費在遊玩嬉戲之中。</p>
<p>有些小朋友，他們以爲在九十幾度的大熱天中，是不宜多用腦力的，他們並且認這個漫漫的暑期爲一個休息的時候，因此，他們對於學校里分發給他們的各種「假期作業」的題目，就都漠不注意，反正旁邊又沒有敎師在督促你們，許多小朋友們於是終日終夜只知道玩耍了。</p>
<p>也有些小朋友，他們在暑假剛開始的一兩天內，對先生發給他們的題目顯得很高興，於是早也寫大楷，晚也寫大楷，一本習字簿在一兩天間就如此地被塗完了。等到放假稍久，他們對各項科目，就全現出不歡喜的態度來啦，這種「趕」出來的成績，不消說得是不會好的。</p>
<p>在事實上，這兩種態度都是要不得的！我們不應該只知道遊玩，我們也不應該虎頭蛇尾地「濫」做，我們在暑期中，都應該在自己的腦經中訂定一種進修的計劃，舉個例來說，早上早點起身，做早操，寫大小楷，讀書，於是再出去玩一會兒……小朋友中或者更有不滿意自己的某種成績不良的學科的，那末，暑假正給予你們以一個最好的，補習的機會。</p>
<p>總之，每一位親愛的小朋友呀，你得好好地支配，利用這兩個月長的暑假，不要讓整個暑假在遊玩巾過去才是啊！</p>
<h3>家庭裏的暑期學校</h3>
<p>— 茜茜</p>
<p>天氣一天天的炎熱起來，連兒的學校裏便放暑假了。</p>
<p>在沒有放假以前，連兒的哥哥心想這樣漫長的假日，他那頑皮的弟弟整日的吃和玩，把這些光陰白白的耗費，豈不可惜；因此替他弟弟設計了一個很完備的補習計劃，他弟弟也便欣然的答應了。那知暑假已開始了好幾日，連兒把讀書寫字的事早已置之腦後了。</p>
<p>他哥哥屢次的督促他，他便似痴假呆的笑了一笑，他大姊姊更替他拿了書呌他讀，一而再勸他這：「讀了書，將來有飯吃，不然，去做乞丐。」可是他那倔强的脾氣，無論用什麼話去勸他，騙他，都沒有效力。有時他哥哥去打他，他也反抗，輸了，大哭起來，引起母親的干涉，因他小的緣故，終得了勝，依舊去玩他的玩意。他們總想不出有效的辦法去使他讀書。</p>
<p>一天，連兒學校裏寄來了他的成績單，他的成績平平，但總算及格。這裏更附着一張暑期學校的簡章，他哥哥因他脾氣的倔强，便用着軟中帶硬的口吻和他說：「你的成績不十分好，還不肯在暑期中好好的用功一下。你學校裏舉辦暑期學校，我看你在家裏不肯讀書，還是進暑期學校吧。你倒底喜歡那一種辦法？」速兒一聽到要到學校裏去，便有些頭痛，他便很快的說：「好，我不願到學校裏去補習，在家裏溫習溫習吧。」「那也好，不過你必須要根據我們訂定的章程才好。不然，呌爸爸送你到暑期學校裏去。」</p>
<p>於是他們兄弟姊妹五人（連兒最幼）都共同遵守着他們共同訂立的章程。</p>
<p>（一）本校定名爲「家庭暑期學校。」</p>
<p>（二）本校請爸爸為校長，媽媽為副校長。</p>
<p>（三）本校採取共同監督制。</p>
<p>（四）本校上課時間：每日上午八時至十一時，除星期日外無例假。</p>
<p>（五）本校課程由各人自定，惟連兒必須修習國，英，算，常識，每日須繳大小楷各一張。國，算兩科由英兒（連兒的大哥）敎授，英文與常識兩科由　兒（連兒的大姊）敎授。</p>
<p>（六）木校目即日起至各人開學前一日止為一學期。</p>
<p>（七）本校概不收一切費用，更不招收新生。</p>
<p>（八）本校學生如有貪玩不讀書者得罰其停吃午飯一次。</p>
<p>（九）本校學生即爲校董。本章程如須修改時，經校董會會議之決議修改之。</p>
<h3>消夏會是暑期的樂園</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>現在又是烈日逼人的夏天了，學校裏已經開始放假啦，你們預備怎樣度過這個長長的假期呢？</p>
<p>在這火熱的暑期裏，過慣團體生活的小朋友，一定感覺到假期生活的沉悶無聊。雖然家裏也有父母指導，兄弟姊妹作伴，但總沒有學校生活那樣快活有趣。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們都有這樣的感覺嗎？現在，我誠摯地介紹你們一個消夏的樂園——那就是四川路靑年會舉辦的「消夏會」。在他們的生活程序表裏，有：一，乒乓，棋奕，游戲；二，書報，雜誌；三，交誼會，團體游戲；四，英中文歌詠；五，常識及科學演講；六，參觀；七，比賽。那裏有得玩耍，有得讀書，聽聽演講唱唱歌，是多麽有興味，有價値的團體生活。小朋友，你願意參加嗎？</p>
<p>他們已在七月一日開始，二個月結束。每天從正午十二時到下午六時，是他們集會的時間。凡是初中和高小學生，年自十歲至十六歲的，不分性別，都可參加。報名時，只要塡寫一張入會書，並隨交報名費一角，以後不收其他費用。</p>
<p>讀者小朋友，趕快去參加這富有意味的集團，快活地度過這個暑期吧！</p>
<h3>暑假期內應注意的幾件事</h3>
<p>— 高歌</p>
<p>時光眞容易過去，匆匆的又是暑假了，小朋友們，二個多月悠長的暑假，不是你們敎師來給你們做些暑期作業，就是你們慈愛的雙親敎你在暑假中做些有益的事，關於怎樣利用暑假這一個問題，想必你們都已有很好的計劃，所以關於這點，我不再提及了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！在暑期中有幾件事是你們最容易觸犯的，我現在把它寫在下面，以做你們的警惕。</p>
<p>少進公共塲所！天，蚊蠅都出來大肆活動都是傳染疾病的媒介，帶病菌給我們的可能，允其是在這酷熱的夏大，更是它們傳染的最好機會，所以一般人在夏天都生了可怕的病，如果在夏天我們進公共塲所去白相，往往他人可怕的疾病，立刻會傳染到我們的身上來了，那是非常危險的，所以我勸各位小朋友們在暑假中應少進公共塲所爲宜。</p>
<p>少吃冷食品：夏天簡直是冷食品的世界，冰洪淋，鉋冰，酸梅湯……等等都是，有許多固然是經過良好的消毒，但是有許多可說是非常不衛生，小朋友們！你們不是常常逛得熱了，不顧一切，而去吃便宜的冷飲嗎？小朋友們！這是萬萬不可以的，在不久前，報紙上不是登載着一個小孩子因吃了不潔的冰棒而不治身死了嗎？小朋友！你們想想，這是多麽危險的一件事呀！</p>
<p>應打防疫針；我們中國人，有一樣不好的脾氣，就是不肯打防疫針，在馬路上我們時常看見一班人因怕打防疫針而飛奔的逃，他們見了打防疫針的人來了，好像來殺頭一樣，這種卑下的習慣，眞會被外國人笑煞呢。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友們！你們都是讀過書的人，想必是沒有這種習慣，我們不但因打防疫針人來捉我們去打，我們還應該自動的去打，這種不是兒戲，而是一種實際的防疫工作呀！</p>
<p>小朋友！以上三件事，你們已實行的想必也有，未實行的我想也有，已實行的小朋友應該不要忘記繼續的實行下去，而未實行的小朋友，允應趕快的去實行呀！</p>
<h3>看圖猜字</h3>
<p>— 于國寳</p>
<p>小朋友們！好久沒有見面了，想念得很。你們校中都放暑假了吧？在家裏做些什麽玩意？遊戲，寂寞嗎？我現在有個玩意給你們玩玩。你看下面我盡着四幅畫，請你看看裏面的東西及擺的位置，再猜猜看組成的是個什麼字？我相信如果你稍用一些腦筋就會被你猜着的。一面可以消遣你的暑假，一面還可以帮助你記憶這個字的寫法，使你永永不會忘記！</p>
<p>謎底：捉苗漁哀</p>
<h3>畢業的典禮</h3>
<p>— 老杜</p>
<p>當他看伊那沈摯的面目慢慢地寬弛了。這年靑的哥哥讓伊一些空隊伊就坐在他旁邊，一束花放在他膝上。</p>
<p>我不能使我的眼光脫離伊那甜而憐惘的臉，而察覺伊輕輕地和他耳語，他便低下了頭把一個個字牢牢地記住。最後伊問他現在可記得那詞句，他點一點頭，表示記牢了。</p>
<p>在秩序單上，一個年輕的人講完了。樂聲又響了的當兒，那哥可更驚奇的瞧伊走上台去，穿過了校董，敎授和著名來賓的一羣，走到校長的面前。</p>
<p>「先生！能不能請你，」伊鞠着躬說：「讓我哥哥再有一個機會，因為現在他已記起來了。」</p>
<p>校長從他金邊的眼鏡裏，凝視了伊好一會兒。最後，笑着允許了伊的請求，於是那失敗的哥哥繼續他的演說了。</p>
<p>音樂奏了一會便停了，簡短的宣布了××先生，他的題目——「歷史的對比。」</p>
<p>聽衆所期望的實現了。靜靜地坐着，又很替那上塲慌的演說者担心，不怕！那年青的英雄驚醒了！他克服了一切實現了他决定的目標雪掉了他的恥辱。那有淚痕的孩子臉上顯出了笑容。我細察那正在演說的臉—大大的眼睛，分開的嘴唇集中全力的注意他那詞句，把靜聽的聽衆都忘了，而伊的精神也隨着他激動了。</p>
<p>演說完了，他奮不顧身的獲得了熱心同情，打破了錯誤的評判。那高貴的聽衆發狂的稱賞鮮花如狂風暴雨般的拋擲上去。伊是協助了伊的哥哥雪了恥——那一張美艷的臉龐，充滿了高昂而欣喜的色彩，這件事永久的銘刻在心坎上。</p>
<h3>畜生道中（八）</h3>
<p>— 靑心</p>
<p>彭其向四面瞧了一會，開始覺得侷促不安起來。他忙着開口問道：「月中人在那裏啊！」那喜歡說話的山雀搶着答道：「他已到別處去了。」</p>
<p>烏鴉問道：「你可有甚麽反對的話要說麼？呀，呀，呀，你要是有膽子的話，敢來挦我的毛麽？」</p>
<p>彭其並不回答烏鴉這些挑戰的話，心中却暗暗地想道：「這些事都奇怪得很，別管它，我且走前去瞧瞧。」</p>
<p>那黑狗汪注的呌了幾聲，但仍讓他走過去；那蜜蜂還是營營作聲的不停地飛着，那搖籃中的貓還是搖擺着，甜甜的睡覺。</p>
<p>彭其又暗暗地想道：「我要是能騎馬前去，那就比自己步行快得多了。」當下他便走到吃草的牝馬旁邊，問它可能帶他趕幾里路。</p>
<p>那牝馬冷冷地說道：「你敢是瘋了，你應常來帶着我走，怎麽要我帶你走呢？」說時，它的鼻子似乎愈伸愈長，它的兩眼中，似乎射出可怕的光來。彭其　了，嚇得什麽似的，幾乎回不過氣來；連忙拔脚就逃，逃得飛一般快，於是他不知不覺的深入了畜生道中。</p>
<p>呀，這眞是一個最美麗的所在。這裏的獸畜，形形式式，比了動物院中更來得多；並且它們都是自由自在的。它們並不互相殘殺，也並沒有弱肉强食的舉動，因爲畜生道中，到處都生着一種很特別的短草，大家都可以吃，大家都可以裝飽自己的肚子。</p>
<p>它們日常相處，彼此都好好的，萬一有什麽口角或不道德的行爲時，那月中人就大聲呼叱道：「守規矩！守規矩！」四下裏便立刻安靜下來，連一些兒聲息都沒有。</p>
<p>凡是這畜生道中的獸畜，不但須守規矩，並且也要有相當的禮貌，彭其一路走去時，它們便成羣結隊的來歡迎他，各有各的方式。那些猫把兩條腿擦着頭，登直了尾巴，好像兵士們舉槍的樣子。狗都搖着尾巴，低低地呌，在他的叫周徘徊着；只有一頭法國種的鬈毛狗，始終端坐不動，也似乎表示它文雅而守禮的意思。那些小烏們很快樂的在囑唧着，或唱着歌。鴿兒們坐在他的肩上，做出咕咕之聲。兩頭燕子，攀住了他的帽檐，牽動着尾巴，呢呢喃喃地似乎對他打招呼。一頭孔雀走到他面前，特地把它那美麗的長尾張了開來；又有一羣玫瑰色的鸚鵡，也聚在後面表示歡迎。一會兒有一頭嚴肅而聰明的老象，來到彭其跟前跪下，彭其興高采烈的爬到他背上，就由它馱着前去，其餘的獸畜，都在後面跟着。</p>

<h3>南匯龍再紀</h3>
<p>過南匯城之龍，長約五丈餘，最粗處如人家儲水之牛腿缸，白如匹練，而全身悉見，並無片雲相隨。惟周身有濛濛之白氣包裹，如人之裸體而被以紗穀之衣，雖不能細睹鱗鬣，而日照其上，色白如銀，蓋即龍之鱗也。其首上闊下狹，大如七石缸。因有白氣環繞，故頭角不露，約略其形，如牛馬之首焉耳。其四足皆在前半身，相離甚近，與世俗之繪者迥殊。四足皆長三尺餘。爪則糢糊不辨。頸與頭皆略細，而腹則獨粗。約計頸一丈，腹二丈，尾則三丈餘也。四足在頸後腹下之粗處，故知後足之外，皆屬龍尾，而尾爲最長也。其尾似鰻魚，平視則圓而闊，側視則細而尖，忽尖忽圓，無定形也。蛇行之曲，一左一右；而龍行之曲，則一上一下。滬城也是圜龍脊牆頭，可謂逼肖。龍在城外最低時，其尾下垂，離地丈許，入城則其尾平而不垂，離地約四五丈，出城則又低至丈許矣。其初出城時，行仍遲遲，忽見東南方黑雲一片，飛駛而來，龍得此雲，其行遂速。愈遠愈高，轉瞬之間，而尾已懸東南方雲內矣。是時東南方雲結龍架，懸龍尾五條，至此而合爲六，色皆淡黑，始悟前此之白，爲有日光照射，近視白夳遠視黑也，人畜無傷，惟北門外揭去瓦屋數椽，草屋一椽。城內屋角一處，大樹一株。東門外草屋數椽。合計二三十椽。當什物被揭去時，但見飛起，而不開其落於何處也。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Resume in Southern Shanxi: Approximately 10,000 Japanese Troops Between Yicheng and Jiang County Advance Southeast in Three Routes Under Air Cover; Hand-to-Hand Combat at Diaoshangou Results in a Major Chinese Victory</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) The once-calm battle situation in southern Shanxi has resumed fierce fighting since the 6th. Approximately 10,000 Japanese troops between Yicheng and Jiang County are advancing southeast in three routes. One force, numbering 4,000 to 5,000, is advancing via Nanchangcun and Shipo. Another force of approximately 2,000 is advancing via Yangxuanmen and Shimen. A third force of nearly 2,000 is advancing via Diaoshangou. All are attacking fiercely under air cover. The Chinese troops on all lines are responding calmly. Particularly in the Diaoshangou area, the Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in intense hand-to-hand combat near Hejiazhuang, north of the 1805 elevation and the Mozi Mountain. The fierce battle lasted a day and night, resulting in numerous Japanese casualties. On the morning of the 7th, reinforcements from a certain unit of the Chinese army rushed from [unclear] to provide support. They have now occupied the Nanjia Village, the 496 elevation, and the Fengjiahe area. Except for a small number of remnants being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army at [unclear], the majority of the remaining Japanese troops have collapsed and fled towards Diaoshangou. The Chinese army is continuing to pursue and mop them up. Another group of Japanese troops advancing from Xuluyu towards Shimen launched a raid on the 6th at noon, with their vanguard troops reaching the Tunpingli area west of Shimen. A certain unit of the Chinese army is currently engaging them. In addition, 200 to 300 Japanese troops from Hengshui Ailicun launched an attack on a certain unit of the Chinese army at the foot of Dongshan Slope on the morning of the 6th, attempting to contain them. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and fled back along their original route. In summary, the battle situation in southern Shanxi is expected to see new developments within the next two to three days. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: The Chinese army in southern Shanxi, braving the rain on the 3rd, launched a surprise attack on Duancun (Anyi area), catching the Japanese troops off guard and rushing into the village. Fierce street fighting ensued, resulting in countless Japanese soldiers killed. After dawn, Japanese reinforcements arrived from Anyi. The Chinese army met them again, engaging in several rounds of intense combat, resulting in heavy Japanese casualties. The fierce fighting was still ongoing as of noon on the 5th. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The strength of the Japanese troops on all battlefields is showing signs of exhaustion, and there are no major battles currently. Although there have been troop movements by the Japanese in southern Shanxi, it does not appear that their numbers have increased, suggesting no new intentions. There have been localized skirmishes in the Zhongtiao Mountain area. Our troops in southern Guangdong have gained a considerable advantage in their offensive. Japanese soldiers in various parts of North China are weary of war, and more than a dozen groups of puppet troops, large and small, have recently defected. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to information received here, there are currently five Japanese divisions in central China and Shanxi. In addition, five more divisions are en route to China. The Japanese are clearly planning a general offensive, as the recent lull on various fronts is due to a shortage of Japanese troops. Chinese military officials claim that the Chinese army has adopted large-scale counter-measures and is fully prepared. Guerrilla units in the guerrilla areas have recently been completely reorganized and their strength has been enhanced. In addition, new troops trained in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces have completed their training and have been dispatched to various fronts to participate in the counter-offensive. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) After the Japanese troops in Yicheng and Jiang County launched a three-pronged offensive on the 6th, the Chinese and Japanese armies are still engaged in fierce fighting. Following a fierce battle and hand-to-hand combat at Diaoshangou, a major victory was achieved. Fengjiahe was recaptured in one fell swoop. On the afternoon of the 7th, Diaoyougou was also temporarily seized. However, due to continuous Japanese reinforcements and intense artillery fire, the Chinese army, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, has now shifted to the eastern highlands of Diaoshangou and is continuing to attack the remaining Japanese troops stubbornly resisting. The remaining Japanese troops surrounded at Xinglong'an have now been completely annihilated. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The recent great victory in Zhongtiao Mountain was achieved by the Chinese army adopting a "sausage-eating strategy." This saying came from a certain commanding officer who personally directed the operation and is particularly evocative. The Japanese army, numbering approximately 20,000, invaded Zhongtiao Mountain, resembling a string of sausages stretching across the mountain range. The Chinese army, unable to eliminate them entirely, decided to resolve the situation in segments, defeating them one by one, just like eating a sausage, slice by slice, cutting it into pieces and swallowing it. As a result, the Japanese army in southern Shanxi was eliminated. Prior to this, the Chinese army achieved the glorious victory of "opening the bag to catch rats" in northern Hubei. In this battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, the Chinese army once again annihilated the Japanese army using the "sausage-eating strategy," with the two achievements being comparable and complementing each other, truly a fine tale of the War of Resistance. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shaanzhou: Over 2,000 Japanese troops from Heshun in eastern Shanxi launched a two-pronged offensive southward on the 3rd. The Chinese army intercepted them along the way, inflicting heavy casualties. On the evening of the 4th, a unit of the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on Liyang, threatening the Japanese troops in Heshun. The Chinese army then launched a full-scale attack on the Japanese troops, engaging in a fierce battle for a day and night. The Japanese army left corpses all over the fields. The fierce fighting is still ongoing. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Victory News from the North Bank of the Xinqiang River</h3>
<p>Miluo: The Chinese army on the north bank of the Xinqiang River launched a two-pronged attack on Zhongfang, southeast of Yueyang, and Dashaping, northwest of Tongcheng, on the evening of the 6th, fighting through the night. By dawn on the 7th, the Chinese army had killed or wounded over 100 Japanese soldiers, captured 22 rifles, and 1 machine gun. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Near Qianjiang Recaptures Key Points</h3>
<p>Fancheng: Lijiadatai and Longtouguai near Qianjiang were recaptured by the Chinese army on the 4th. At the same time, the Chinese army at Majiatai also launched a fierce attack on the Japanese. The Japanese troops in the city immediately came out to reinforce and surrounded both flanks of the Chinese. After the Chinese army engaged them separately, the Japanese were defeated and retreated. Subsequently, over 200 Japanese infantry and cavalry rushed out of the west gate, launching a counterattack on the Chinese under the cover of their artillery fire. The Chinese army utilized the open terrain there, launching a series of attacks. In total, over 100 Japanese soldiers were killed and over 200 were wounded in the above battles. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese are engaged in fierce fighting in the Caojiatai, Zuojiatai, and Dingjiawan areas. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Aircraft Bomb Japanese Positions in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Wengyuan: On the morning of the 7th, a squadron of Chinese air force [unclear] aircraft flew from a certain location and bombed Japanese positions in Shengang, Taipingchang, and other places in Conghua, dropping dozens of bombs, destroying Japanese soldiers' shelters and fortifications, and killing or wounding over 100 Japanese soldiers. After completing their mission, the Chinese squadron safely returned to base. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Tinggang, Part of Jieyang County, Repelled by Local Militia; Japanese Troops Retreat After Offering Slight Resistance; Chinese Pursue and Kill Many Japanese</h3>
<p>Liuhuang: Japanese troops from Shantou attempted to land near Jieyang on the 4th in multiple motorboats. After fierce firing by the Chinese army, many Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese troops fled. Subsequently, the Japanese troops approached and harassed several times but were repelled by the Chinese army. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuhuang: On the afternoon of the 5th, over 100 Japanese infantry and cavalry invaded Tinggang, part of Jieyang County. A certain unit of the Chinese army, taking advantage of the Japanese troops' lack of a secure foothold, joined forces with the local militia and surrounded them. The Japanese troops offered slight resistance and then collapsed and retreated. The Chinese army pursued them, killing over 30 Japanese soldiers. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attempted Landing Off Yuhuan Island, Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Jinhua: At 9:00 AM on the 8th, three Japanese warships and over ten motorboats carrying 70-80 Japanese soldiers, under the cover of two Japanese aircraft, forcibly landed at Jiaobaotou on Yuhuan Kanmen Island. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese defense forces, the Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, immediately collapsed and retreated to their ships. Before leaving, they seized over ten civilian boats. In the afternoon, a total of five Japanese warships were anchored in the waters near Kanmen, including one Japanese warship carrying two Japanese aircraft. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinhua: At 2:00 PM on the 7th, five Japanese warships shelled and covered the landing of an unspecified number of Japanese troops on Liuhong Island outside Zhenhai Port. At the same time, the Japanese warships shelled the area with over 30 shells. As of the evening, the Chinese army was fiercely resisting. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Units Southwest of Langfang Are Very Active</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The train that originated from Shenyang did not arrive here this morning. According to the Japanese military spokesman, the reason was that the tracks between Shenyang and Shanhaiguan were destroyed by mountain floods. However, the first train is expected to arrive here tonight. Furthermore, according to the spokesman, there are 1,000 guerrillas eight miles southwest of Langfang, between Beiping and Tianjin. The Japanese army is currently "mopping up" them. Moreover, according to the spokesman, the Japanese army here originally planned to conduct exercises last night, but they had to rush to the suburbs to deal with the guerrillas, and the exercises could not be held on time. It was also said that although the Japanese army has now been dispatched to deal with the guerrillas, in fact, it will still be in vain. (8th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: Several thousand guerrillas from a certain unit of the Chinese army have recently been active along the Pingjin Railway. On the 7th, they concentrated their forces and launched an attack on Langfang, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army and advancing toward the railway line. Furthermore, over 200 guerrillas from a certain unit arrived in Tianjin on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Areas East of Nanlin Bridge Lost and Regained</h3>
<p>Shanggao: On the morning of the 3rd, over a thousand Japanese soldiers, under the cover of machine guns and artillery, launched a fierce attack on Shentangpu, Tangxupu, and other places east of Nanlin Bridge. The Chinese army met them head-on, and the fighting was fierce. The Japanese army was killed by the Chinese army in large numbers. The fighting continued until 2:00 PM, when these locations fell into Japanese hands due to the disparity in numbers. On the morning of the 4th, Chinese reinforcements launched a counterattack and sent out a surprise force, flanking the rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and fled. These locations were then recaptured. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Yi Announces Blockade Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Chairman Chen Yi recently announced blockade countermeasures, encouraging his subordinates and all compatriots in the province to work hard. The general idea is that the Japanese have recently stepped up their blockade of our seaports. We have now developed countermeasures, mobilized human, financial, and material resources, and will intensify our efforts in the future to exert the strong support of our protracted war strategy in military, political, and economic terms to resist the enemy's blockade tactics and prepare to crush any attempt they make.

<h3>Recent Disputes in Shanghai's Educational Circles</h3>
<p>Recently, several disputes have occurred in Shanghai's educational circles: some involve mutual accusations over registration issues; others involve mutual ridicule over issues of legitimacy; some boast of their contributions while accusing others of plunder; and some flaunt their former status while regarding others as usurpers. Specific examples abound. When internal disagreements occur within educational institutions, outsiders unfamiliar with the inside story are unable to discern the truth, and the matter remains confined within the walls of the institution. However, when such disputes are published in newspapers and broadcast to the public, as in the case of the dispute over the preservation of school roots and the dispute between the main campus and branch campus of Yangzhong School, the facts are exposed, and society cannot help but pay due attention. Although Shanghai society is large, the impact of any turmoil in three or four schools is no more than a drop in the ocean. However, in the context of Chinese social customs, the actions of educational institutions are always under scrutiny. Moreover, in these recent times, when a dark atmosphere shrouds the isolated island and culture and education are under the constant surveillance of the enemy, these disputes in three or four schools could provide an opportunity for others to exploit vulnerabilities. If the forces of evil were to seize this opportunity, the entire future of education could face a crisis. We must be cautious and tread carefully, and we earnestly hope that these three or four schools will put the national interest first and handle the situation properly, taking care not to escalate the situation. Furthermore, other schools besides these three or four should take warning from these internal conflicts and not allow the solid foundation of Shanghai's educational circles, which has been built up since August 13th, to be gradually eroded.</p>
<p>We need not examine the specific details of the disputes in the three or four schools individually. Generally speaking, the matters disputed by these three or four schools mainly revolve around the issue of "legitimacy" versus "usurpation." The problem of legitimacy versus usurpation did not exist before the Chinese army withdrew from Shanghai, nor does it exist in other parts of Shanghai. Only in Shanghai at this time and place, where some municipal schools have transformed into private schools, and some inland schools have relocated to Shanghai as semi-public, semi-private schools, have disputes over legitimacy or usurpation arisen between the original schools and the new schools, which have adapted to the environment and adopted different names, and which have different personnel due to changes in time and space. However, all schools involved in this dispute have their own basis: some have preserved records as material evidence; others have gathered former personnel to demonstrate continuity; and some have even completed registration procedures, claiming that their certificates are sufficient to overwhelm the other party. In fact, these claims only represent the local history of the schools and do not necessarily constitute the basis for inheriting the school. Since the original school has been suspended, those who have not been ordered to relocate or re-establish cannot be considered as the continuation of the original school simply by gathering private individuals with connections. Even if the competent authority makes such an assumption due to special circumstances, the assumed entity is the entire school organization, not the private individuals who are currently in charge of this organization. However, what we see today is not a dispute between schools, but only a dispute between private individuals. Therefore, the so-called dispute over legitimacy versus usurpation in the current three or four schools is, in fact, quite hollow.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dispute over legitimacy versus usurpation is, in fact, unnecessary. If the competent authority has such an assumption, then which legal basis is sufficient only needs to be determined by the competent authority with a single word, and right and wrong can be distinguished in an instant. What is the purpose of the dispute? The current three or four schools do not consider this point at all, and still cling to their own arguments, as if their participation in the dispute is confident and fearless, or perhaps they believe that what they are arguing for is enough to reverse the assumption made by the competent authority in the past, so the current right and wrong can be ignored. Therefore, what they are fighting for is ostensibly a matter of legitimacy versus usurpation, but in reality, it is outside the issue of legitimacy versus usurpation. What they are fighting for is the division of personnel, using the issue of legitimacy as a superficial cover. In other words, the dispute over legitimacy is, in essence, a dispute over factionalism.</p>
<p>Factionalism is a very common phenomenon in social personnel matters, and education, which is not an isolated undertaking from society, is naturally not immune to it. However, in the past two years, Shanghai's educational circles have been supporting the precarious situation amidst the harsh environment, with more cultivation than harvest, so there has been no need for this dispute. However, in recent times, as school undertakings have developed rapidly and the harvest is no longer as meager as in the past, disputes have repeatedly occurred. However, today's China has not yet escaped the most difficult journey, and the national united front cannot allow even the slightest gap. Educational circles are knowledgeable pioneers, so how could they not understand this meaning? Therefore, leaving aside the issue of education itself, if we consider the interests of the country and the nation, could the current petty disputes not be resolved?</p>
<p>For the sake of the three or four schools, what should be noted at present is: first, instead of quibbling over the dispute over legitimacy, it is better to strive for self-improvement. On the one hand, gain the trust of society with real achievements, and on the other hand, establish their own legal status with legal procedures. It is good to inherit the system of public schools, and it is not bad to be a well-established registered private school. Second, instead of mutually criticizing, it is better to cooperate with each other, abandon prejudices, put aside factionalism, and jointly complete the great cause of education for the War of Resistance and national construction under the iron rule of the united front.</p>
<h3>Outer Mongolian Border Territory Captured; Intense Artillery Battles Between Japanese and Mongolian Forces; Nomonhan Highlands Turn to Scorched Earth; Mongolian Artillery Units Display Power With Nearly Every Shell Hitting</h3>
<p>Reuters Correspondent Special Dispatch from the Front Lines on the Manchurian-Mongolian Border, 7th: The Nomonhan Highlands in the disputed area of Hailar have today become "no man's land" between the two armies. Outer Mongolian and Japanese troops have been firing artillery at it. After three days of battle, Japanese troops have occupied the most important Mongolian military position east of the Khalkhyn Gol River and have secured several crossing points. Mongolian infantry, assisted by artillery units, are fiercely resisting. The reporter witnessed the artillery battles between the two sides near the intersection of the Kustengeer and Khalkhyn Gol rivers today, as Japanese troops are eager to build bridges there. The range and direction of the Mongolian artillery units are extremely accurate. The reporter was forced to leave the observation point as the artillery fire intensified. Japanese aircraft have been very active throughout the day and have repeatedly bombed Mongolian artillery positions and transportation routes. The reporter witnessed the complete destruction of a Mongolian village, with flames soaring and residents fleeing in all directions, a very tragic scene. The reporter also saw Japanese bombers dropping bombs continuously near the intersection of the Kustengeer and Khalkhyn Gol rivers. Mongolian troops did not open fire with anti-aircraft guns. During the two days the reporter was at the front lines, the reporter only saw Mongolian aircraft passing over the Japanese positions once. They flew very high and, after circling briefly, flew back. According to Japanese claims, they have captured 100 enemy soldiers in the first three days of the war, as well as 10 tanks and some light and heavy machine guns. The reporter saw a small group of prisoners, including several Soviet soldiers and one Mongolian soldier, but could not speak to them. It is generally believed here that a large number of Soviet reinforcements are being transferred from garrisons in Siberia to the front lines. Currently, heavy rain is hindering transportation, and the air pressure is very low, so aircraft activity has decreased. All circumstances suggest that the current war will continue for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Japanese War Report</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese battlefield news, the commander of the Japanese air force base near Nomonhan is Lieutenant Colonel Kato. When the large "Heinkel" aircraft flew from Berlin to Tokyo in April of this year, Lieutenant Colonel Kato was the chief pilot of the aircraft. Now he is actively engaged in border air combat in the Nomonhan area, personally leading air units into battle. It is said that Lieutenant Colonel Kato directed the battles in which 97 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft were shot down on June 27th and 53 enemy aircraft were shot down on July 4th.

<h3>Normal Diplomatic Relations Maintained Between Japan and Soviet Union</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Although conflicts occur from time to time on the border between Outer Mongolia and Manchuria, Japan and the Soviet Union still maintain normal diplomatic relations. When Japanese Ambassador Shigenori Togo visited Soviet People's Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Solomon Lozovsky the other day, the discussion was limited to the dispute between Japanese commercial oil and coal mining companies on Sakhalin Island and the Soviet trade unions, and nothing else. In this regard, the Soviet court fined the companies 630,000 rubles because the quality of the goods supplied by the companies to the Soviet workers was inferior to that stipulated in the contract. The Japanese government has now acknowledged that the Soviet accusations are justified but has requested a reduction in the fine. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Prepares to Hold Artillery Tactical Competition</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The units of the Soviet Red Army are currently actively preparing to hold a competition on artillery tactics for the entire Soviet Union. According to a statement made by the Red Army Artillery Commander Voronov to the press, "The scale of this competition is unprecedented in the history of our Red Army. Participants will include all types of artillery, from small field guns to heavy artillery, everything that should be there. The results of the competition will be announced on September 15th, and the winners will be awarded various prizes." (7th Tass Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Claims Japanese Military Resources Dwindling; Casualties Reach Over 910,000; Chinese Military Strength Steadily Increasing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a statement made today by Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese military casualties have reached 917,800, and 8,555 have been captured, which is the greatest success in China's war for national freedom. Furthermore, during the war, 716 Japanese aircraft have been shot down, and 644 Japanese ships have been sunk by the Chinese. Regarding the issue of military resources, He Yingqin stated that the Japanese can only mobilize 2.5 million people into combat units. In addition, 1,974,000 people are only used to replenish the first line, second line, and garrison reserves. The Japanese are currently deploying 31 divisions in China, 8 divisions in Manchuria, and 2 divisions in Korea. There are 6 and a half divisions in Japan, all of which cannot be mobilized. Although Japan can still mobilize 17 divisions, they must be used to counter the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen that Japan's military resources are approaching exhaustion. As for China, military strength is steadily increasing. Furthermore, China can use all of its strength to deal with Japan, but Japan definitely cannot use all of its strength to deal with China.

<h3>Regarding the Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Tokyo: Kato's Statement, Need to Discuss the Entire Concession Issue, But Britain Claims to Only Discuss the Tianjin Incident, France Pays Close Attention to Future Situation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Political circles and public opinion here have issued increasingly sharp comments on the upcoming Anglo-Japanese talks. According to a statement by Kato, the leader of the Japanese delegation, "The true importance of the Anglo-Japanese talks lies in discussing the entire issue of foreign concessions in China." Kato declared that for the past two years, Japan's military actions in China have been constantly hindered by anti-Japanese elements within foreign concessions, especially in Shanghai and Tianjin. If the British concessions in China are not subjected to the strictest control, there will never be peace. The demonstration declaration by representatives of various groups is even more resolute in its anti-British attitude. Today, the "National Farmers and Workers United Association" paraded and demonstrated in front of the British Embassy, shouting slogans, and its resolution was "Warning Britain to fundamentally revise its anti-Japanese Far East policy." The "Tokyo Student Union" also sent a resolution with the same content to the British Ambassador Craigie. Various newspapers hope that the Tokyo talks will be a turning point in Anglo-Japanese relations. (8th, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Colonel Shimizu, Director of the Japanese Army Intelligence Department, declared to reporters yesterday that since the foreign concessions in China have adopted a hostile attitude towards Japan, Japan is determined to take effective measures. The Japanese government has always avoided any anti-British propaganda or demonstrations, hoping that Britain can understand Japan's goals and position. Now Japan's patience has reached its limit. In the history of Anglo-Japanese relations, the Japanese people have never harbored such great jealousy towards Britain as they do today. Shimizu continued, Japan will never succumb to British threats or sanctions in order to implement its Far East policy. If Britain continues to hold this attitude and proceeds with Anglo-Japanese negotiations, he dares to assert that the negotiations will break down immediately. (8th, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) According to government sources last night, if the Japanese side raises wide-ranging issues in this Anglo-Japanese negotiation, the British side will definitely reject them. The British side believes that this negotiation can only involve the Tianjin incident. Furthermore, if the Japanese side insists on discussing broad issues, the British side will inform them that they cannot be discussed without the participation of the United States and France, as the interests of the United States and France in China are the same as those of Britain. The British side will guarantee that the British concession in Tianjin will never become an anti-Japanese base. Regarding the issue of maintaining China's currency system, the British side will not discuss it unless the United States and France also participate. (8th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese Tianjin incident negotiations will begin next Friday. Representatives of the Japanese army in Tianjin are currently consulting with the military authorities in Tokyo on the incidents to be raised during the negotiations, and they have been quite busy recently. This kind of meeting will take place throughout the day today, and tomorrow and Monday, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military authorities will hold long meetings. Foreign Minister Arita will report on the various circumstances that led to this Anglo-Japanese meeting at the regular cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, and will request cabinet approval of his policy for handling the Tianjin incident. Arita will draft an agenda and will likely invite the British Ambassador to the ministry this afternoon to discuss the matter and the final details of the meeting. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is closely monitoring the development of the Far East situation. According to reports received here, when the British and Japanese authorities conduct negotiations in Tokyo, the Japanese side intends to discuss the Tianjin British Concession incident and also involve the current system of general concessions. If this is true, the United States and France should come forward to intervene, so as to avoid setting a precedent that would be detrimental in the future. Furthermore, according to news from Tianjin, although the blockade there is very strict, the food supply to the French Concession is still satisfactory. (8th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources here today, anti-British gatherings of residents here were held in areas controlled by the Gan side. One gathering was held in the Chinese area, and another gathering was held in the First Special District. (8th, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Attacked Chongqing, Bomb Fell Near British Warship, Japan Expressed Apology</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the British Embassy, yesterday when Japanese planes bombed Chongqing, they nearly hit the British gunboat "Cricket". The Japanese side has now expressed apologies to the British side. It is said that when Japanese planes bombed Chongqing, the British warship's anti-aircraft gun team responded with anti-aircraft guns, but at the time they could not see where the Japanese planes were, so they did not counterattack. (8th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Ottawa, Canada. Regarding the case of Reverend and Mrs. Caswell of the Canadian Holiness Church in Changde, Hunan Province, China, who were bombed to death by Japanese military aircraft on June 24, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Canadian Embassy on the 6th of this month, expressing apologies and promising compensation. This place has now followed the order of Federal Prime Minister Mackenzie King and announced the original text of the note, which roughly says, "The Japanese aircraft pilot, due to poor visibility, failed to recognize the national flag painted on the roof of the Holiness Church, thus causing this unfortunate incident."

<h3>British Sailor Winterbottom Released</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Winterbottom, the chief mate of Taikoo's Changsha ship, who was arrested by Japanese military police on July 5, was unconditionally released at 10:30 this morning. The British Consul-General, Weightman, protested strongly to the Japanese authorities because the Japanese side detained Winterbottom for three days without notifying the British Consulate. Today, a Reuters reporter met with Winterbottom. According to Winterbottom, at 3:00 AM on July 5, he did not know the roads in Hankou, so he asked for directions at a Chinese home. However, several Chinese people drove him out without asking why. He argued with them, causing the Chinese to knock over a table. They then summoned Japanese sentries who detained him in a small house in the concession area. Later, he was transferred to a very dirty room in the Chinese city, where he was detained with 20 Chinese people. He only received one meal a day. The next day, he was taken to the Japanese military police office in the concession. The Japanese side asked him to sign a statement stating that he had gone to this Chinese home for three consecutive nights. Because he had not been there except that night and had facts to prove it, he refused to sign. Finally, he wrote an apology, expressing his apologies for pushing the Chinese and knocking over the table. After that, he was released. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>International Women's Suffrage Alliance Holds Annual Meeting in Copenhagen, Song Meiling Sends Telegram to Express Regards, Asking for Assistance in China's War of Resistance</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The International Women's Suffrage Alliance will hold its 13th annual meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, from the 8th to the 14th of this month. At the invitation of the alliance, Madame Chiang sent a telegram on behalf of Chinese women, saying, "Chinese women respectfully extend their congratulations to your esteemed alliance. We understand the significance of your alliance more profoundly than anyone else. For thousands of years, Chinese women have been confined to their homes, not asking about foreign affairs. Seven years ago, the National Government first implemented the policy of equality between men and women, giving women all civil rights and interests. Today, this government is leading 450 million people to resist Japanese aggression and struggle arduously in order to obtain national freedom and lay the permanent foundation for world peace, justice, and equality between men and women. In order to achieve the universal realization of women's rights and interests, we firmly request your alliance to assist our brave and sacrificing Chinese compatriots and female compatriots in particular, so as to establish a free new China. Only then can women in East Asia continue to cooperate with women around the world to jointly seek cultural progress." Chiang Song Meiling. (8th)</p>
<h3>Manchester Guardian Discusses Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian, in its discussion today of the beginning of the third year of the Sino-Japanese War, stated that Japanese politicians and military personnel have now gained the lesson that battlefield victory is one thing, and victory in the overall war is another. Japan seems to have had some success in solving military problems, but has completely failed in solving the diplomatic and administrative problems that followed. Japan now has no other better policy than to make all situations reach the terrible extent to which the Chinese may be forced to seek peace at any cost. However, judging from news from all sides, the Chinese fighting spirit and discipline are improving daily, and their political unity is unprecedented. As for the Chinese guerrillas, the arguments in the Pacific Affairs magazine can be cited for reference. It said that one thing that Japan, which has expanded too much, must fear is that the long-term support of the guerrillas will allow a newly organized and trained regular army to be established behind its lines. If so, the sun will "set". In addition, there is a contradictory phenomenon in the Sino-Japanese War, that is, although the Japanese have won victories on various fronts, they are now anxiously eager to end the war, while the Chinese, although they have lost almost everything, are now actively preparing to continue the war. The Chinese calmly wait for the opportunity, retreat into the interior, and are confident that final victory will ultimately belong to China. (8th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Britain and France Implement New Policies, Relying on Military Force as a Diplomatic Backing, The Two Countries Negotiate a New Sky Agreement, Allowing Military Aircraft to Practice Crossing Borders</h3>
<p>(London) According to news today, Britain and France are currently negotiating the conclusion of a new air force agreement, allowing British bombers to be allowed to conduct long-distance flight exercises in French airspace. The agreement intends to give the British Air Force the opportunity to prepare for war against Germany. At the same time, a well-trained squadron of the British Air Force is preparing to fly to Belgium to visit friendly countries, and then plans to continue flying to other countries. The purpose is to announce to the world that the British army is ready to take action. Military sources say that the authorities have considered a plan for mutual visits between the British and Polish Air Forces. This plan has not been officially confirmed, but according to the new policy of Britain and France, using strength and expanding military effectiveness as diplomatic backing, the plan will soon be implemented. (8th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(London) The official figures for the strength of the British Air Force have not been released, but according to informed sources, the British Air Force now has more than 6,000 high-speed fighter planes and more than 12,000 bombers. In addition, the Ministry of Aviation is actively training air force pilots and plans to fly in the airspace of other countries for practice. It has now requested the French government to allow British aircraft to conduct non-stop flights in southern and southwestern France, and wants to give the same convenience to the French Air Force. Aviation experts claim that once this method is implemented, the training received by British Air Force pilots will be the same as in wartime, and Britain and France can demonstrate a realistic cooperative situation. At the same time, the quality of British aircraft and the strength of the Air Force can be clearly known to all countries. (7th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Situation in Danzig Somewhat Eased, Germany Continues to Have Intentions in Slovakia, Building Military Roads Connecting to the Two Provinces of Pomorze, Army Holds Large-Scale Exercises in the Center</h3>
<p>(Paris) Observers here recently declared that although the Danzig issue is temporarily calm, Germany may take action against Slovakia. Given that the German authorities have decided to complete the repair of all military roads in Bohemia and Moravia immediately, the German army is holding large-scale exercises in the center, and other departments also seem to be making military preparations, the concerns are not unfounded. As for the city of Danzig, the situation has eased, and it may not change in some time. This can be seen from the fact that German leader Hitler has gone to his Berchtesgaden villa to rest, and Polish President Mościcki has also left the capital to spend his summer vacation. Generally speaking, after the British and French authorities issued a firm statement, if the Danzig issue is attempted to be resolved by violence, it will be difficult to make it a local incident. In addition, German wheat is ripe and about to begin harvesting. During this busy farming season, it is not appropriate to launch a large-scale offensive. All these points are well-known to the German authorities. (7th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>British Education Minister Warns Germany</h3>
<p>The British city of Derby. The Education Minister, Lord De La Warr, gave a speech here this afternoon, warning Germany, roughly saying, "If aggression occurs again, Britain will definitely resist it. In recent months, British public opinion has abandoned the spirit of complacency and has a determination to resist. The whole people, although unanimously hoping for peace, are determined to resist any attempt at aggression and control. If a European war breaks out over the issue of the Free City of Danzig, it is because the German government knows deeply that an independent Poland is an obstacle to its plan to control all of Europe, and the maintenance of the status quo of the Free City of Danzig is related to the independence of Poland, so it wants to first occupy the Free City of Danzig and then strive to control all of Europe. That's all. If the two countries want to reach a compromise, they must be sincere with each other. If one party goes back on its word at any time and place, it will be difficult for any compromise to be reached. Based on this, we must fulfill our commitments to all countries that are guaranteed by our country, firmly cooperate with them, and clearly declare that any aggressive country, no matter how cunning the means of aggression used, will definitely be resisted. We have the ability and the preparation to do so. If there is anyone who proposes a compromise to us, it must be genuinely sincere in seeking peace and able to lay a lasting peace, which is what we are happy to hear." (8th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain to Deliver Important Declaration Tomorrow, Not Allowing Violent Change to Danzig</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of the Free City of Danzig, Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a declaration to the House of Commons on the 10th of this month. It is reported that he will review the various proposals that Germany made to Poland in March of this year, and the reasons for Poland's rejection, and state that the Danzig issue is of great importance, thereby restating the position adopted by Britain. (8th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) According to informed sources, although the situation in the Free City of Danzig has eased somewhat, Prime Minister Chamberlain still intends to deliver an important declaration to the House of Commons on Monday (the 10th), informing domestic public opinion that if the status quo of the Free City of Danzig is attempted to be changed by violence, Britain will have to intervene. The German and Polish sides have conducted negotiations, but have achieved nothing, and the blame lies entirely with the German side. Regarding this matter, Poland is reported to have fully agreed. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has also telegraphed Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying that the British government not only consulted the Polish government on the content of the declaration and sought its agreement, but also maintained close contact with the Polish government on whether it was appropriate to issue this declaration, which is deeply appreciated. Political figures here commented on the situation in the Free City of Danzig, saying that the door to negotiations is still wide open for abolishing the city's current system and replacing it with a system acceptable to both Poland and Germany.

<h3>Free City of Danzig Engaged in Military Preparations, Building Fortifications Along the Baltic Coast, Poland Has Determination to Defend its Territory, Military Supplies Transported Busily in the Eastern Triangle</h3>
<p>Warsaw. According to news received here, the authorities of the Free City of Danzig are currently continuing to conduct military preparations, and the various measures taken are as follows: (1) Building defensive fortifications along the Baltic coast of the city, and installing eight light machine guns in civilian houses near the Schichau wharf; (2) Many German ships have recently docked at the Schichau wharf, bringing in large quantities of machine guns and small cannons, which have been distributed to various barracks; (3) A special military committee has been established in Danzig to select young people to join the recently organized volunteer army; (4) Polish customs inspectors are prohibited from entering the city's airfield, and Polish workers serving at the Schichau wharf have been dismissed. In addition, according to the "Warsaw Courier," the fortifications on the Bischofsberg heights in Danzig have been completed, and defenses are being built along the coast in the Geglau area. (7th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Warsaw. According to today's "Warsaw Daily," coastal fortifications are being built between Danzig, Schwinemünde, and Glettkau. It is reported that these fortifications are defense works other than the artillery positions on Bischofsberg Mountain on the outskirts of Danzig, and the barbed wire and trenches laid on the Polish-Danzig border. Fifteen Czech workers employed in the fortifications in East Prussia attempted to flee into Polish territory and were arrested by the Danzig police. Currently, members of the National Socialist Party are still angrily denying that they have transported weapons into Danzig, and believe that rumors that military preparations have been made on Bischofsberg Mountain and elsewhere are ridiculous. It is said that the construction on Bischofsberg Mountain is a children's sports field. There are no new developments in Danzig. National Socialist newspapers report that Poland may be conducting a plan, including economic sanctions, but there is no news from the Polish side to substantiate this claim. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Poland has begun to transport food, oil, and military supplies to the eastern "triangle area." This action is being implemented on the advice of the French military.

<h3>French Government Encourages Childbirth, Newlywed Couples Who Have Four Children in a Row Can Receive a Huge Sum of 20,000 Francs</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to today's newspaper, in order to encourage population growth, the French government stipulates that each newlywed couple can borrow public funds of 20,000 francs, with an annual interest rate of two percent. If the couple has a baby in the future, 3,000 francs of the loan can be reduced. If they have a second and third baby, 5,000 francs can be reduced for each child. If they have a fourth baby, the remaining 7,000 francs do not need to be repaid either. In other words, after each couple has four children, the borrowed public funds of 20,000 francs will be completely canceled. (8th, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<h3>German Government Orders Mobilization of All Levels of Able-bodied Men, Deadline for Registration and Physical Examination, Army Can Increase to One Hundred Divisions</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The government authorities recently posted notices in the streets, stating that all men born in 1918-19-20, all those born in 1914-15-16-17 who have not yet enlisted for some reason, and all those born in 1906-07-10-13 who have not undergone a physical examination for some reason, must report to the examination committees everywhere between the 7th of this month and the 9th of September to undergo a physical examination for enlistment. (8th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government authorities' recently decided conscription measures have been commented on by all official parties, roughly saying that this matter has no special significance. Since the restoration of the conscription system in March 1935, Germany has begun to reorganize the army, and now it continues to do so, conscripting new recruits who have not yet enlisted. Among them, each of the 1918-19 classes has about 300,000 to 350,000 recruits, and the 1920 class has at least 400,000. According to the total number of German army personnel, there are 53 divisions. Once all the new recruits have enlisted, they will increase to more than 100 divisions. The National Socialist Stormtroopers, the Protection Squadron, the Labor Service Corps, and the police are not included. The German government's intention to step up the conscription of new recruits is to calmly cope with all incidents. This is what the German government authorities have repeatedly stated.

<h3>British Consul-General Stationed in Vienna Withdrawn</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to information obtained here, after the German government requested Britain to withdraw its Consul-General stationed in Vienna, the Consul-General has already left Germany and returned to his country last night. (8th, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German semi-official sources recently issued comments stating that the reason for Germany's request for Britain to withdraw its Consul-General stationed in Vienna, Gardner, is due to Britain's recent deployment of spy networks in Germany and the installation of intelligence personnel in its diplomatic missions. British diplomatic representatives, such as Consuls-General and Consuls, have special training in gathering intelligence. Germany finds it difficult to tolerate this kind of fact.

<h3>Axis Powers' Military Strategy Attempts to Control the Mediterranean, Italian Newspaper Praises Greatly Increased Strength, Ciano Goes to Spain to Persuade Usage</h3>
<p>Milan. The Italian "Popolo d'Italia" published an article today, commenting on the current political and military situation in Europe, declaring that the military position of Germany and Italy today is much stronger than it was at the time of the Munich Conference. Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and Italy's annexation of Albania have greatly strengthened their strength. If a war breaks out, the central Mediterranean will be completely under the control of the Italian navy and air force, and the Western powers' sea routes from west to east in the Mediterranean will be cut off by the Axis powers.

Italy has no intention of interfering in Spanish policy, but Italy and Spain have the same interests in the Mediterranean, so Italy and Spain should strive for common ideals.

<p>Minority Issues Resolved Amicably by Germany and Italy</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the dispute over minority issues between Germany and Italy, the two governments have established an amicable solution. This issue arose after the Upper Adige region of former Austria (namely the two regions of Tyrol and Trentino) was ceded to Italy in 1919. Now that it has been resolved, Germans in the region are now allowed to return to their homeland. Any losses incurred due to abandoning land will be compensated by the Italian government, but this does not mean that 200,000 Germans in the region will be moved to Germany en masse.

<h3>Mutual Assistance Agreement Issue: Three Nations Continue Negotiations, British and French Representatives Meet Molotov Again, Presenting New Proposals and Urging a Quick Response</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naggiar; the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds; and the Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, Strang, are scheduled to visit the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, at 6:00 PM today to continue negotiations on the mutual assistance agreement issue. It is rumored that the Soviet Union intends to request that Britain and France also provide guarantees regarding changes in the political systems of the Baltic states. Strang denied this, calling it absurd. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to official sources, the new instructions of the British and French governments to their representatives in Moscow constitute the final proposals of the two major democracies to the Soviet Union. It is reported that Britain and France have requested a prompt response from Moscow. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Last night, the British government admitted that although discussions on Soviet participation in the Anglo-French front in Europe have been ongoing for thirteen weeks, a final agreement has not yet been reached. The latest instructions from the British and French governments remain strictly confidential and will not be disclosed before the Soviet Union is informed. Regarding the suggestion that the Soviet Union should assist Britain and France in defending the Netherlands and Switzerland, Britain and France will not insist that the Soviet Union accept it. On the other hand, Britain and France also hope that the Soviet Union will abandon its demand that the Anglo-French-Turkish-Polish mutual assistance agreement be included. If so, the only difficulty lies in the Soviet Union's demand that the tripartite alliance include "indirect aggression." If this issue is also resolved, the tripartite agreement can certainly be concluded. The main articles of the agreement are as follows: (1) If any of the three countries is attacked, the three countries will assist each other. (2) If any of the three countries assists a guaranteed country, the three countries must assist each other. (Associated Press, 8th) (Paris) Although the new proposals of Britain and France have been delivered to Moscow, there is considerable doubt here as to whether the Soviet Union will accept them. "Le Journal" and "L'Oeuvre" reported the contents of the Anglo-French proposals as follows: (1) Britain and France agree to place the Netherlands and Switzerland outside the scope of the guarantee, but on the condition that the Soviet Union abandon the mutual assistance pact with Turkey and Poland. (2) The guarantees of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to the Baltic states are divided into two types: (A) If the Baltic states are directly attacked, the three countries will automatically take military action. (B) If domestic events in the Baltic states cause the Soviet Union to feel threatened, the three countries must first consult before taking military action. According to the two newspapers, if the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is not satisfied with the above proposals, the three countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, may temporarily sign only a tripartite mutual assistance agreement and postpone the guarantee issue.

<h3>Soviet-Egyptian Relations: Soviet Union Insists on Restoring Relations First Before Negotiating Trade</h3>
<p>Cairo The Egyptian Minister of Finance announced yesterday that negotiations with the Soviet Union to restore trade relations have broken down because the Soviet Union demanded that Egypt first diplomatically recognize the Soviet Union before engaging in negotiations. The British government had urged Egypt to accept the Soviet demand, but Egyptian officials and gentry, due to the different political systems and ideologies of the two countries, refused to agree to establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Although Egyptian officials hold this opposing view, the government is currently considering establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, hoping that the negotiations between the Egyptian Ambassador to Britain and the Soviet Embassy in Britain will continue.

<h3>German Business Representatives Go to Moscow in a Private Capacity to Promote Trade Relations</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to foreign sources, two German business representatives have arrived in Moscow by plane from the capital of Latvia to conduct trade negotiations with the Soviet authorities. This rumor was denied by the German Embassy, ​​which stated that it is true that German business people came to the Soviet Union in a private capacity. It is said that this caused the rumor. On the British side, it is said that if the tripartite mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can be concluded, it will create good conditions for the development of Anglo-Soviet trade relations.

<h3>Bulgarian Parliamentary Delegation to Visit Soviet Union for Economic Talks</h3>

<h3>Germany and Bulgaria Strengthen Relations; Discussions between Representatives Focus on Economic Issues</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov visited here on the 4th of this month and held talks with the German authorities. An official communique was subsequently released, stating briefly, "The talks were very friendly and fully in line with the traditional and natural friendship between Bulgaria, Germany, and Italy." Political figures here stated that the discussions between the German and Bulgarian representatives focused on economic issues, and an agreement may be concluded soon. However, foreign observers stated that the discussions between the German and Bulgarian representatives did not achieve any positive or significant results, as evidenced by the vague comments from the German side. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The official visit of Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov to Germany has ended. According to a communique issued here last night, it stated that Bulgaria is an element of maintaining order in southeastern Europe and mentioned the natural and traditional friendship between Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria, saying that it hopes to deepen political, economic, and cultural relations between them. It is heard that the talks between the Bulgarian Prime Minister and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop were mostly about economic matters, but the issues of Dobruja and Macedonia were also discussed in detail. Bulgaria has not yet formally made demands regarding the above two regions, so people here believe that this issue has not yet reached an urgent stage. Although all sectors in Germany claim to sympathize with Bulgaria's demands, it seems unlikely that there will be any concrete expression in the near future. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria Regarding Prime Minister Koseivanov's visit to Germany, the "Zora" newspaper here has issued a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that German political figures are fully aware of Bulgaria's position and will do their utmost to assist Bulgaria in overcoming all difficulties. The German side, in view of the amicable relations between the two countries, has not requested Bulgaria to accept any restrictions or conclude any new agreements. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Queen Personally Handles Cabinet Crisis, Inquiring of Military Leaders, Showing Concern for the Far East</h3>
<p>The Hague According to well-informed sources here, the Queen of the Netherlands is personally mediating the cabinet crisis. Given the tension in the international situation, and in order to protect the country's major interests, she hopes that the cabinet difficulties will be resolved as soon as possible. Yesterday, the Queen summoned the speakers of both houses of parliament, the former Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Fock, and the chiefs of staff of both the army and navy to the palace. The presence of these military leaders has led to a general belief that the Netherlands' military position in the Far East is closely related to the new cabinet. General opinion is that former Prime Minister Colijn can overcome the difficulties and form a new cabinet. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>The Hague Since the cabinet crisis in the Netherlands occurred, a new cabinet has not yet been formed. Former Prime Minister Colijn has denied rumors that he has given up forming a new cabinet. Yesterday, the Queen met with the speakers of both houses of parliament and the president of the Council of State for discussions. Political figures here believe that the Queen will again urge Colijn to form a new cabinet. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Syrian President Resigns, Dissatisfied with French Policy</h3>
<p>Damascus, the capital of the Syrian Republic The President of the Syrian Republic, al-Atassi, resigned today. His letter of resignation stated briefly, "After I signed a treaty with France on behalf of this country in September 1936 (stipulating that Syria would become independent three years after the implementation of this treaty, but the French Parliament rejected the ratification last year), I was trusted by the National Assembly and took on the difficult task. Successive cabinets have also believed that this treaty would enable this country to obtain its due position. However, our efforts have not been successful, and the policies pursued by the mandatory power (i.e., France) are contrary to the Franco-Syrian treaty. I have no choice but to resign to thank the people of the country." (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>Prominent Figure in French Financial Circles, Mr. Tannery, Passes Away</h3>
<p>(Paris) A prominent figure in French financial circles, Mr. Tannery, who served as the Governor of the Bank of France in 1935, has passed away. Tannery's appointment as Governor of the Bank of France was widely regarded as the first step in reorganizing the management of the bank to make it more subject to government control. The Popular Front was dissatisfied with Tannery's appointment, believing that he was too closely associated with the old regime. He was succeeded by Labeyrie in 1936. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Imperial Japanese Edict Enforces Compulsory Labor, Invoking National Mobilization Law, Millions Will Be Conscripted</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) An imperial edict was promulgated this morning, invoking Article 4 of the National Mobilization Law, to be implemented from July 15. The article stipulates compulsory labor for businesses necessary for national mobilization. It is estimated that approximately ten million people will be conscripted. The full text of the article is as follows: "When it is found necessary to implement national mobilization in wartime, the Japanese government may, in accordance with the provisions of the imperial edict, conscript the people of the Empire and order them to engage in businesses of national mobilization. Persons mobilized under government control in accordance with this article will be paid the same wages as they received before being conscripted." (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>US Senate Opposition Blocks New Neutrality Act, 34 Senators Issue Declaration, Government Faction and Opposition Are Equally Matched</h3>
<p>(Washington) Thirty-four senators, led by Republican Senators Johnson and Nye, have signed a declaration opposing the revision of the current Neutrality Act. It stated, "We firmly oppose the repeal or modification of the current Neutrality Act, which prohibits the sale or export of arms and various military supplies to belligerent countries. At the same time, we cannot agree to grant the executive branch the power to designate aggressor nations among the belligerent countries for the sake of expediency. We believe that after war breaks out in the future, the United States should maintain a position of genuine neutrality. This belief must be maintained to the end by all glorious and proper means." The last sentence probably refers to using delaying tactics to obstruct the establishment of the new Neutrality Act. (Havas, 7th).</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to study the Neutrality Act amendment issue on the 11th of this month. The discussion will focus on Chairman Pittman's proposal, the main point of which is that the "cash and carry" provision should apply to all arms and other goods. Pittman recently stated that after the Foreign Relations Committee meets five or six times, it can draft a report and submit it to the Senate for discussion around the 20th of this month. Political observers believe that after the Neutrality Act proposed by Bloom, which was approved by the House of Representatives with the Volstead Amendment (maintaining the arms embargo during wartime), both the government faction and the opposition faction have decided to adhere to their original positions. Therefore, there will inevitably be a fierce debate in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. After the report is submitted to the Senate in the future, the intensity of the discussion can also be predicted. As it stands now, the government and the opposition factions are equally matched, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. The opposition senators in the Senate will inevitably use delaying tactics to obstruct the establishment of the new Neutrality Act. However, according to government sources, the core members of the isolationist faction, such as Republican Senators Borah and Johnson, are older and will hardly be able to speak eloquently for hours at a time in this hot summer season. Younger people like Nye will have more difficulty extending the speech time, so it is unlikely that delaying tactics will achieve any success. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Johnson, representing San Francisco, claimed that 34 senators have recently signed a declaration, stating that they will fight any change to the existing Neutrality Act with all the glorious and legitimate means at their disposal. It is said that this declaration is a threat to prolong the debate on the government's neutrality proposal. Some senators said they recognized this as an open threat to those who procrastinate. The US government was not greatly disturbed by Senator Johnson's actions. Government officials said that Johnson's influence was not as great as usual. Although the government acknowledged that there would be a long and fierce debate on the Neutrality Act, it now increasingly believes that President Roosevelt will ultimately achieve his goal.

<h3>New York Mayor Visits Chinese Antiquities Exhibition, Delivers Speech Attacking Aggressor Nations</h3>
<p>(New York) The Mayor of New York City, LaGuardia, accompanied by the Chinese Consul General in New York, Yu Tsune-chi, visited the Chinese Antiquities Exhibition today and delivered a speech, urging the citizens of this city to assist China in resisting Japanese aggression in various ways, saying, "This war against human rights should not be allowed to continue." He then spoke to Consul General Yu, "We are deeply aware of your country's situation and your country's heroic resistance to the aggressors." At this point, he fiercely attacked the various dictators, saying that they were engaged in invading other countries' territories. The Chinese Antiquities Exhibition is hosted by the China Aid Movement Committee here and is chaired by President Roosevelt's mother, Mrs. Roosevelt, and Chinese Ambassador Hu Shih as honorary chairmen. All proceeds will be allocated to the relief fund for the orphans of Chinese soldiers, which was initiated by Madame Soong Mei-ling, the wife of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang.

<h3>US Senate Reviews Bill to Stop Purchasing Foreign Silver; Discussions in Finance Committee Unproductive; Treasury Department Lowers Purchase Price of Foreign Silver</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Townsend, a Republican from Delaware, introduced a bill in January of this year to suspend the purchase of foreign silver. The main points can be divided into four: (1) Authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to sell the existing 1,700,000,000 ounces of silver at prices he deems favorable to the government. (2) Minting currency with 500,000,000 ounces of silver. (3) Allocating $250,000 for US industrial expansion of silver uses. (4) All imports of foreign silver should be prohibited. This case has been submitted to the Senate Finance Subcommittee for discussion, but no agreement has been reached. Discussions will continue next week, and Secretary of State Hull has been invited to attend and express his views. Political figures believe that Secretary of State Hull will certainly comply. It is said that there are many senators who oppose the purchase of foreign silver, and they even threaten to introduce a bill demanding a complete ban on it. Therefore, clarification of this issue still requires effort. Observers claim that when the Townsend bill is submitted to the Senate for discussion, opposition senators may jointly mention the general issue of relations between the United States and Mexico. This is because Mexico has benefited the most from the US silver purchase policy, and the negotiations regarding the expropriation of US-owned oil mines in that country have been protracted, and the attitude of President Cárdenas of that country is extremely lacking in sincerity. Most senators are therefore extremely dissatisfied and may use this as an excuse to prohibit the Treasury Department from continuing to purchase foreign silver. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Currency Committee met yesterday to discuss the plan to stop buying foreign silver, but it was fruitless and the meeting was adjourned. According to Republican Senators Townsend and Taft, a bill prohibiting the purchase of foreign silver is bound to be passed. According to US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, before obtaining a more detailed report on the world silver situation, the US Treasury Department will use a "daily" standard for purchasing silver. Morgenthau continued that the recent sharp decline in world silver prices was unexpected. The State Department has now notified the Canadian government that the US has resumed its agreement to purchase 1.2 million ounces of silver from Canada. Yesterday, more than 2 million ounces of silver were shipped from Mexico to New York. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department continued to lower the purchase price of foreign silver yesterday to 36.75 cents per ounce. This price remained the same today. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) People in the London silver market originally expected that the United States would adjust silver prices to match those in London. Now that they hear that the US Treasury Department has decided to buy foreign silver at a price of 36.75 cents per ounce, they are all happy, believing that they are far-sighted. Although London's silver market is strong in the long term, it is possible for the United States to raise the purchase price. However, the US official price will not fluctuate with the market price in London on a daily basis. The current price level, unless there are other developments, is unlikely to change significantly in the near future. However, the US decision to redistribute the silver purchase procedure has psychologically benefited the London silver market. At the same time, many people in the silver market believe that India will take advantage of the current low silver prices to continue purchasing, so that the profits earned from recent gold sales can be used for investment.

<h3>Spanish Socialist Leader Under Indictment, Military Tribunal Considers Death Penalty</h3>

(2) Pascual is also responsible for the national strike in 1917. (3) When King George VI of England held his coronation ceremony in 1937, Pascual represented the Republican government to congratulate him and held talks with important figures in British political circles. The prosecutor indicted in court, saying that the defendant's crime should be punished with the death penalty. However, some believe that Pascual is old and frail and may be acquitted and released. Others said that Pascual was one of the leaders of the former Republican government and should be severely punished. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>Invading Japanese Troops in Guangdong Focus on Raiding the Upper Reaches of the Dongjiang River; Japanese Troops from Various Units Gather in Dongjiang and Chaoshan Areas; Chinese Troops in the Beijiang Area Are Taking Advantage of the Situation to Advance Southward Step by Step</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: After withdrawing from Chao'an, the Chinese army is concentrating in the Quxi-Jinshi area in the western suburbs of Chaozhou, preparing for a counterattack. At the same time, fresh reinforcements are also heading to the front lines from certain key locations to intercept the enemy. Above Jieyang, the mountains overlap and the paths are narrow, making it difficult for Japanese artillery and cavalry to exert their power. Therefore, from Jieyang to Tangkeng-Shekeng, and further northwest to Xingning, and due north to Meixian, all are dominated by towering mountains, creating a situation where "one man guards the pass, and ten thousand cannot pass." Even the Japanese air force cannot find targets to bomb. Therefore, it is clearly not easy for the Japanese army to attempt to raid the Guangdong-Jiangxi border via this route. In the future, the advance will be made via three routes: one is to concentrate forces near the suburbs of Guangzhou to scout Boluo, Heyuan, Laolong, and Longchuan, and raid Xingning. Simultaneously, they will advance from Miaoyang to attack Tangkeng and Shekeng to flank the east of Xingning. Another route is to scout Dabu and Meixian from Chao'an to shake the north of Xingning. The dispatch of the South China Expeditionary Army of the Japanese army, led by Ando, to Chaoshan seems to be to command the Jieyang front, using that area as the main force. On the other hand, they are transferring Japanese troops from Xijiang, Beijiang, Qiongyai, and Jiangmen to gather in Shilong and Taiping of the Dongjiang River, as well as Humen, aiming to break into Boluo and Heyuan from the south bank of the Dongjiang River, realizing their treacherous plan to attack Xingning from the north. Therefore, it has been reported recently that the Japanese army in the Shilong area has increased to more than 2,000 men. It is also rumored that a Japanese aircraft carrier stationed on Weizhou Island in Hainan has secretly sailed to Pinghai Harbor in Huiyang, accompanied by armed ships. At night, patrol ships use searchlights to illuminate the shore. On the sea off Haifeng, on the 25th, Japanese warships were spotted shelling the shore to test the strength of the Chinese army. Even Xingning, Laolong, Meixian, Heyuan, and other places have been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft. This is indeed a prelude to the Japanese army's restless movements on land. At present, the Chinese local forces on the south bank of the Dongjiang River are on strict alert. At the same time, the various divisions of the XXX Corps of the regular army are taking advantage of the transfer of Japanese troops in the Beijiang area, leaving the defenses empty, to advance southward step by step, hoping to take Guangzhou in one fell swoop. Recently, the Chinese army on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway broke through the Japanese camp in Xinjie, directly pressing on the various areas of Shangpanyu. Plainclothes teams have been spotted in the Xiaogang area near the city, greatly alarming the Guangzhou H army. All the city's patrol teams have been withdrawn to garrison in the suburbs. As a result, foreigners in Shamian are even spreading rumors that the Japanese army in Guangzhou is preparing to withdraw. The defensive works of the Japanese army in Shaqi and other places have been removed. However, the Japanese army does not seem to intend to completely abandon Guangzhou at present. However, it is a fact that some Japanese agencies in the city have been relocated. The Japanese army headquarters originally located at the Osaka warehouse on Fenghuanggang in Henan, Guangzhou, suddenly moved to Huangpu on the 25th. All military supplies and special operations battalion soldiers were transported to Huangpu via the new city road by transport vehicles. It is also rumored that the Japanese army originally stationed in Sanshui Southwest in Xijiang has also withdrawn to Guangzhou and will be transferred to Chaoshan. The propaganda personnel under their protection have also withdrawn with the main force. Looking at the withdrawal of defenses from Guangzhou and the Northwest Jiang by the Japanese army and their reinforcement of Chaoshan, the depletion of their forces can be seen.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Residents Forced to Participate in Anti-British Rally; White Russians in Qingdao Also Forced to Participate; Many Japanese Do Not Agree with Anti-British Sentiment</h3>
<p>Late news from the North China Daily News reports that on the afternoon of June 23, around 3 o'clock, personnel from the Qingdao Municipal Health Bureau, protected by Japanese guards, plastered anti-British posters on the walls of the British Consulate General, British commercial firms, and public buildings. Later that day, they also distributed leaflets throughout the city. At 11 o'clock in the morning, a mass rally was held in the Third Park, led by the principal of a certain Chinese school under Japanese protection. Japanese textile mills also suspended work for a period of time that day, allowing Chinese workers from the mills to participate in the rally. Attendees were paid 30 cents per adult and 5 cents per student. In addition, Chinese stores were ordered to send one representative each, with those who disobeyed facing a fine. Many Chinese people dressed as Japanese were present to monitor whether Chinese people obeyed the order. Representatives from the White Russian Anti-Communist League were also ordered to attend. About 40 or 50 White Russians were present, displaying shame and reluctance. They were threatened with expulsion from the country, so the White Russians reluctantly agreed to participate. A local English newspaper criticized the rally, saying, "The spontaneous feelings of the people have been demonstrated by the procession that departed from the Third Park." This statement from the editor seems to be satirical, as there is ample evidence indicating that apart from the Japanese, Chinese people either participated under coercion or were paid to do so. After the rally, a procession was formed, marching through the main streets to the municipal government building and the British Consulate General, shouting "Down with Britain" before ending. Among the Japanese themselves, there was indeed evidence of disagreement with this action. Japanese staff from Mitsui &amp; Co. were seen standing outside the office all day, tearing down anti-British posters as soon as they were pasted on the walls. Yokohama Specie Bank refused to allow posters to be pasted on its walls. Many smaller Japanese shopkeepers also took similar actions until they were ordered not to tear down the posters. Rear Admiral Murray of the British warship HMS Cornwell paid a courtesy visit to a certain Japanese admiral on June 22. The latter returned the visit to the British Consulate General at 10 a.m. on June 23. When the Japanese admiral arrived at the consulate general, seeing the posters pasted on the building and other surrounding buildings, he expressed to the British Consul General and Rear Admiral Murray that he did not approve of the means taken by the Japanese military authorities that day and apologized to them. Not long after the Japanese admiral left the consulate, a team of Japanese marines arrived to protect the British Consulate. The British authorities did not request Japanese protection, but the Japanese admiral had guaranteed before leaving the consulate that no disrespectful incidents would occur. These Japanese guards, carrying rifles with bayonets fixed, prevented the procession from getting too close to the British Consulate General building. The day passed peacefully. British nationals in this situation remained calm. White Russian employees in British commercial firms were ordered to resign from their positions in British stores. However, as they rely on these firms for their livelihood, they ignored the order. It is expected that they will continue to face pressure. Chinese employees in British commercial firms also fear that they will be forced to quit.</p>
<h3>Showing Sympathy for China's Resistance Against Japan: Head of Indian Ambulance Team Passes Through Hong Kong, Returns Home to Report on Work</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Indian people are extremely sympathetic to China's resistance against Japan and are concerned about the wounded soldiers and civilians in the Chinese interior. Therefore, in mid-September of last year, under the guidance of Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, an ambulance team was dispatched, bringing 50 boxes of medical equipment and two ambulances, departing from Bombay, via Singapore to Hong Kong, and then transferred from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, to be directed by the Chinese authorities to serve on the front lines and provide relief to wounded and sick Chinese soldiers and civilians. Now, Dr. Caorjia, the deputy leader of the team, because he has been in China for more than half a year, needs to return home to report on his work, so he came to Hong Kong from Chongqing on the 29th of last month, waiting for a ship to India. Now, Dr. Caorjia has provided a detailed account of the team's work and recent situation, as follows:</p>
<p>According to Dr. Caorjia, they came to China last autumn to serve, and after arriving in Guangzhou, they went north to work in Hankou. At that time, the battle of the Yangtze River was quite intense, so they treated wounded soldiers day and night, with almost no rest. Later, when Wuhan was in danger, they were ordered to move to Yichang to continue their work. After Wuhan fell, Yichang was frequently bombed by Japanese planes. Although they raised the Red Cross flag and the flag of the Indian National Congress, they were not spared. They had no choice but to retreat to Chongqing. In the spring of this year, knowing that medical supplies were particularly scarce in the Northwest, they left Chongqing again to work in the Eighth Route Army. Until now, all the team members, under the leadership of the team leader, continue to work hard, traveling thousands of miles for the sake of sympathizing with China's resistance against Japan, and working hard in or near the war zone. Dr. Caorjia said that they feel very happy because their purpose in coming to China, in addition to saving lives and healing the wounded, and doing their duty as human beings, is mainly to express the Indian people's deep sympathy for China's resistance against Japan, and their willingness to do their best to support China in fighting against the aggressors on a common front, and to work for the national liberation of both China and India. After arriving in the interior, they were not only loved and welcomed by the Chinese people, but also helped each other in everything, as close as brothers and sisters. They also felt that the good customs of the Chinese people were admirable.</p>
<p>Since the start of the second phase of the war of resistance, the Chinese army's resistance has obviously increased, and the Japanese army's offensive has in fact reached the point of exhaustion. As for the medical equipment in the army, it is also becoming increasingly complete, but there is still a shortage of many medicines, especially in the Northwest. There are many wounded soldiers and sick people, but medicines cannot be supplied in a steady stream due to transportation issues. In addition, items such as clothing and books are also in great need. Therefore, in addition to reporting on the work situation, he will also raise some medicines and money in India to bring back for use, etc.</p>
<h3>Guilin Provincial Assembly Recommends Maintaining Guangxi's Mining Industry; Advocates Correcting All Past Restrictions; Proposal Passed and Sent to Provincial Government for Implementation</h3>
<p>Guilin Correspondence: The Guangxi Provincial Provisional Assembly recently held its opening session, lasting a total of 14 days, with an extension of 4 days to discuss special review cases. The most important of these special review cases was the issue of mining affairs. Before the outbreak of the war of resistance, Guangxi's mining industry was quite developed. Manganese mines and iron mines were found everywhere. As for the tin mines in He County, Fuchuan, Hechi, and Nandan, and the antimony mines in Binyang and Qianjiang, there were no fewer than a hundred mining areas. About 130 large and small companies were engaged in mining. Furthermore, the tungsten mines in Teng County and the gold mines in Mengjiang, Shanglin, Cangwu, and Fengyi were also flourishing. The Guangxi provincial treasury has always relied on this as a major source of income. After the assembly opened, the assembly members all believed that the regulations on mining and transportation formulated by the Department of Construction in the past were too restrictive, and most operators in the mining industry found them inconvenient. Since the Sino-Japanese War began, various mineral products related to military use have been subject to strict export restrictions. Although the authorities have established offices to control trade, the restrictions on foreign exchange and the low prices have caused huge losses to various mining companies and merchants. Some have even suspended operations or gone bankrupt due to losses. Coupled with traffic congestion and transportation difficulties, various mining industries have plummeted. The assembly members, representing the will of the people of the province, used this gathering to extend the session by four days specifically for the discussion of mining affairs. The main points were: (1) Request the government to approve 50% of foreign exchange in order to purchase industrial supplies and hardware to facilitate mining in various mining areas. (2) Request the government to raise prices and purchase mineral products, or set fair prices according to the fluctuations of the current market value. (3) Request the government to grant long-term exemptions from mining taxes, transportation taxes, and road fees. (4) Request the government to organize a mining industry review committee to mediate all temporary disputes related to mining affairs. (5) Request the opening of mining areas in Pingnan, Guiping, and Wuxuan to assist production. (6) Request the elimination of various overlapping taxes on mineral products to ease the burden on merchants. (7) Request the government to purchase more coal and charcoal machines and rent them to mining merchants to avoid mining stoppages due to oil shortages. The above seven items are all for the sake of the future of the mining industry in the province. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese and domestic wealthy merchants believed that the Guangxi authorities were committed to the construction of new enterprises and once opened up various mining affairs throughout the province, attracting shareholders and wealthy merchants from home and abroad to invest in mining in Guangxi. Therefore, several years ago, merchants who invested in mining in Guangxi sprung up like mushrooms, and those who engaged in this industry, such as tin mining, manganese mining, and tungsten mining, all made great profits at one time. Later, the Guangxi provincial government issued regulations restricting the mining industry due to the issue of tax increases. Later, because mining was seen as a source of great profit, powerful military and political figures began to compete with the people for profits, often using military and political power to seize superior mining areas. After that, there was control of mining trade, restricting free transportation and export, with the government setting up special offices to purchase mineral sands, engaging in exclusive operation and transportation. At this point, the mining industry declined. The provincial assembly recently put forward the above proposals, wanting to maintain Guangxi's mining industry, but this is only a stopgap measure. A fundamental remedy still requires thorough reform by the government. The proposals have now been passed by the assembly and sent to the provincial government for separate handling. The mining industry in Guangxi may have a glimmer of hope for relief.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Bomb Explosion: Shanghai-Nanjing Train Narrowly Escapes Disaster; Train Arrived Only Seconds Before Explosion; Guerrillas Active Along Railway Line; Japanese General Offensive Against Pudong Fails</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that the Shanghai-Nanjing express train operated by the "Central China Railway Company" under Japanese control arrived in Wuxi yesterday (July 7). Seconds after the engine passed over the spot where a bomb was buried, the bomb exploded. The train was almost destroyed. The driver and fireman, alert, immediately braked to a stop, averting a major disaster. Although the engine escaped the full force of the explosion, part of it was damaged. No casualties were reported. The engine and tracks were heavily damaged, disrupting rail traffic. Japanese soldiers immediately rushed to the scene, dispatching troops to search for guerrillas on both sides of the railway. This special action was clearly the work of guerrillas. Another group of Japanese soldiers led passengers in groups on foot to a nearby station, where they waited for a train from Suzhou to take them down to Shanghai. Passengers were all inspected at the station and subjected to strict questioning. The damaged site is currently under repair. Although Shanghai-Nanjing rail traffic is still running, passengers must change trains at the explosion site. The Japanese authorities in these areas have recently tightened regulations on the movement of Chinese civilians. Travelers are subject to inspection and questioning and must present passes issued by the Japanese Special Service Department. Military passes issued by other parts of the Japanese army and navy are not recognized. According to news received here today, fierce fighting is taking place near Yixing. Guerrillas in that area and the surrounding area have been increasingly active recently. The business of a certain Japanese transportation company headquartered in Shanghai is now limited to Suzhou. Business beyond any location past Suzhou has been suspended.</p>
<p>The Whole Story of the Japanese Army's General Offensive Against Pudong</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, about 2,000 Japanese troops, puppet troops, and puppet police launched a general offensive against Pudong, with Datuan as the target. This matter stemmed from the defection of 100 puppet police officers in Nanqiao, who engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The defecting troops then joined Tao Sheng's forces. Tao's garrison was centered on Datuan, and Datuan was also the center of the Pudong guerrillas. The Japanese army then mobilized heavy troops in an attempt to "thoroughly suppress" them. Japanese planes first dropped seven or eight bombs on Nanhui City, attempting to send troops to occupy it, and then advanced westward to Datuan. At Chaitangwan, they were fiercely attacked by the guerrillas under Gu Lifeng. After the Japanese army suffered a defeat, they seemed to have abandoned the attack on Datuan. The main force gradually withdrew to Pubin, and the various ports along the Pu River, such as Zhanggang and Tangkou, were blockaded.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Luhui</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. on the 2nd, more than 800 Japanese troops advanced towards Luhui Town by land and water. One route advanced towards Hangtou, and the other left Luhui Town and advanced towards the guerrilla headquarters. A unit of the motorcycle patrol also advanced to the right side of the original headquarters, firing inside with strong firepower. After about a quarter of an hour, no return fire was seen. They entered to search, but there was nothing suspicious. They then knew that the headquarters had been moved elsewhere and returned in disappointment. Before they had gone half a mile, they were suddenly ambushed by a squad of guards. At that time, the fierce battle began. Machine gunners suddenly opened fire on the Japanese army, and more than 20 Japanese soldiers fell in response. The Japanese army began to retreat, and the guerrillas immediately pursued.</p>
<p>Japanese Bombardment</p>
<p>When the Japanese army reached a village and prepared to counterattack, they encountered the First Battalion again. The intensity of the battle was the fiercest since the start of the war of resistance. At that time, more than 400 Japanese troops from Hangtou used artillery and other large quantities of sharp weapons, making a desperate attempt. When the Japanese army reached Jingyangzhi Bridge, they saw a flower factory that had been incinerated by incendiary bombs.</p>
<p>Chinese Victory Report</p>
<p>It is reported that in this battle, the Japanese army lost one officer and more than 50 soldiers, and more than 100 were wounded. The guerrillas captured six sets of uniforms, two Japanese flags, eight steel helmets, one telescope, one small steel cannon, five light and heavy machine guns, 17 rifles, and six boxes of ammunition. Unable to vent their anger, the Japanese army sent planes the next day to drop incendiary bombs. Almost the entire town of Luhui was turned to ashes. Details are still to come from Datuan, Xinchang, and Luhui.</p>
<h3>Concessions Cancel Emergency Alert, Traffic Restored</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council implemented an emergency alert for one day the day before yesterday. The situation went very well. This alert was cancelled as of 0:30 yesterday morning (8th). All obstacles at the road intersections bordering the two concessions and at the bridges across the Suzhou Creek were also removed or placed on the side of the road before 5 a.m. yesterday morning to allow vehicles and pedestrians to pass. The English-owned Tram Company's Nos. 5, 6, and 7 streetcars and No. 18 trolleybuses all started to run directly to the North Railway Station at the border road yesterday morning. The junctions of the Chinese and the Shanghai Western concessions, such as Daxilu, Hongqiao, and Tushanwan, have also been opened. Flights from Shanghai to the guerrilla areas have also resumed yesterday, such as those to Fengjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Songjiang. The shops and entertainment venues along Avenue Edward VII have also resumed normal business. However, all public group meetings will still be postponed until after the 10th in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Christian Groups Self-Renewal Movement, Establishing a Covenant of Reformation, Correcting Bad Habits</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, due to changes in the environment, the general public has become accustomed to extravagance and decadence. The Shanghai Christian Student Organizations Association has launched a self-renewal movement for this purpose, establishing a covenant of reformation, asking student circles in various provinces and cities to respond and implement it in order to save the situation. A few points are listed below:</p>
<p>Practice frugality, thrift, and service. Those with money contribute money, and those without money contribute effort. (1) I establish and strictly implement a personal budget system and develop the habit of keeping daily accounts. (2) I do not make new clothes. When it is necessary to make them, I do not make expensive or luxurious ones. (3) I do not have the idea of disliking the old and liking the new for daily necessities. (4) I (female students) use less cosmetics. I do not wear silk stockings or perm my hair. (5) I do not use fancy envelopes and stationery to write letters. (6) I reduce eating snacks. (7) When there are empty seats on third-class trams, I do not necessarily have to ride in first class. (8) I take fewer photos when touring parks with friends. (9) I do not often hold dinner parties. When I do, I can implement the practice of everyone paying for their own meal. (10) I reduce spending during holidays. (11) I practice frugality in life and save money every month to donate to the country and those who are suffering. (12) I do my best to serve the student fellowship or social charity and educational work. (13) I help with family affairs and homework, and do my own things as much as possible without having to bother others. (14) I will pay attention to the lives of the masses (rickshaw pullers, workers, police officers, newspaper boys, etc.), find more opportunities to approach, understand, and help them.</p>
<p>Reject bad habits and entertainment. Proper entertainment is the vitamin of life. (1) I use hobbies such as sports, music, chess, calligraphy, painting, and writing, as well as group life, to replace improper entertainment. (2) I reduce the number of times I watch movies (once a week, only watching valuable films, or possibly not watching movies). (3) I do not go to unconscious or low-level entertainment venues (including dance halls, etc.).</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Attaché Points Out Concessions Authorities' Hope for Cooperation Between Concessions and Organizations; States the Court Issue is Most Unpleasant</h3>
<p>Continental Daily reports that Japanese Naval Attaché Vice Admiral Nomura, at a press conference yesterday (the 7th), issued lengthy remarks concerning the two-year "undeclared war" in China and the status of the Shanghai International Settlement. He urged officials in the International Settlement to recognize the "City Government" as the de facto authority in the area. Nomura declared, "We want the International Settlement authorities to recognize the Nanjing 'Reformed Government' and the Shanghai 'City Government.' We observe a tendency among the International Settlement authorities and others to firmly ignore these new Chinese administrative organs. If this continues, cooperation between the International Settlement and the Chinese administrative organs will be quite difficult. This is a matter of acknowledging existing facts, rather than blindly claiming such organs do not exist."</p>
<p>Japanese Side Recognizes Puppet Organization as the De Facto Authority</p>
<p>When asked if he acknowledged the "Reformed Government and City Government" as Japanese organs, Nomura replied that this was the result of a Japanese policy for Chinese to manage Chinese affairs. However, Nomura clarified, "The Japanese government does not recognize the 'Reformed Government and City Government,' but Japanese army and navy leaders recognize them as de facto authorities. When a new 'Chinese Government' is established, the Japanese government will grant recognition. What the Japanese side wants is for the International Settlement authorities to work together with this 'government,' without necessarily recognizing it in a legal sense."</p>
<p>Most Unpleasant Regarding Chinese Courts in Both Concessions</p>
<p>Nomura recounted that the Chinese courts in the International Settlement are "organs of the Chiang regime," handling cases related to Japan or Japanese people under Chiang's orders. This is something the Japanese military cannot tolerate. The jurisdiction of the courts should be transferred to the Japanese side. The International Settlement authorities have refused to approve the transfer and have instead voiced support for the courts. The Japanese side expresses sincere gratitude for the Municipal Council's efforts to suppress terrorism in the International Settlement, but the courts, at the very least, remain the most unpleasant phenomenon."</p>
<p>Goes So Far as to Call the South Bank of the Suzhou Creek a Hostile Zone</p>
<p>Efforts to restore the normal state of the International Settlement have been underway for some time. Various obstacles to cooperation between the Japanese side and other authorities have also been removed. Therefore, it is hoped that normality will be restored soon. However, if the south bank of the Suzhou Creek continues to be maintained as a hostile zone, and the authorities on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek continue to lack cooperation with the Japanese side, it will be quite difficult to unconditionally restore normality to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. If one of the two areas does not improve, the other area cannot improve either.</p>
<p>Every Household in Japan Experiences Suffering</p>
<p>Nomura then discussed the issue of the "undeclared war," saying that the idea of acting "as if things are normal because war has not been declared" is one of the reasons why the situation cannot improve. For example, Japan has dispatched over a million soldiers to fight. The dead and wounded number in the thousands. Throughout Japan, every household is feeling the impact of the war. To say that the situation is normal because war has not been declared is absurd."</p>
<p>War Prolonged, Both Countries Exhausted, Eagerly Await End</p>
<p>When asked whether declaring war was merely a formality, he replied that Japan was acting in self-defense, fighting against the Chiang regime and not against the Chinese people, which is why war had not been declared. When asked how long he believed the war would last, Nomura replied that the war was exhausting not only the belligerent nations but everyone else as well, and therefore it was hoped that it would end soon. However, this would depend on other countries involved in the war.</p>
<h3>Discount on Drafts is Illegitimate Trading; All Banks and Money Shops Resolved Not to Engage; Four Banks Will No Longer Maintain Discount Rate Hereafter</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the discount on drafts, the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed instructions to strictly prohibit it. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association both advocated that all businesses in the same trade should uniformly and strictly restrict the handling of requests from depositors for the payment of drafts, as this is the only way to eliminate abuses. Therefore, regardless of fixed-term or current account deposits, only company branches with genuine commercial needs will be allowed to pay for drafts through the same industry; no leniency will be shown to private individuals or firms. With such a narrow scope, it is hoped that the financial situation can be maintained in a normal state, and the trend of discounting will not become increasingly severe. Now that the new draft system has been implemented, drafts can be remitted to the interior to purchase local goods and are already used in the same way as cash. There should no longer be any discounting. In order to prevent the discounting of draft notes in speculative foreign exchange transactions, reporters from the New Voice Agency learned yesterday from the Banking Association, Money Shop Association, and Currency Exchange Association that all member banks and shops of the three associations have resolved not to engage in this illegitimate business of discounting drafts. At the same time, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have resolved not to maintain this discount rate hereafter and hope that non-member small money shops, silver companies, and firms will not engage in this illegitimate business, which would fuel speculation, violate government financial policy, and cause unrest in the financial industry. This matter concerns the vital interests of the industry and is inconsistent with the original purpose of drafts.</p>
<h3>Currency Exchange Industry Exhibition of Fake and Obsolete Banknotes; Scheduled to Open Tomorrow; Location is Qingyuan Lane</h3>
<p>The Currency Exchange Industry Fellowship Association plans to hold an exhibition of Chinese and foreign fake and obsolete banknotes. They have collected no less than two hundred types of fake and obsolete banknotes. In addition to fake and obsolete banknotes from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, there will also be fake and obsolete banknotes from Citibank, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Philippine pesos, French francs, and other countries. There will also be banknotes from the Great Qing Bank, the first paper money issued by the Chinese Central Government, and military banknotes from the warlord civil wars, all with dates recorded. The opening is scheduled for the 10th of this month at 50 Qingyuan Lane, on the third floor of the association's clubhouse. It is reported that the association is providing admission tickets free of charge for the interest of its members.</p>
<h3>Restriction on Withdrawal Method; Legally Effective; Judicial Yuan Notifies All Levels of Courts</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the Ministry of Finance used a telegram to stipulate the method of restricting withdrawals. The Shanghai silver and money industries were ordered to comply. Now, it is heard that the Ministry of Finance believes that this new restriction method must have legal effect and has specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Judicial Yuan for notification to all levels of courts in Shanghai. The Executive Yuan approved the request and immediately notified the Judicial Yuan for further notification.</p>

<h3>Draft Preparation Inspection Committee to be Established; First Inspection Scheduled for Late July; Draft Certificates Will be Issued When Needed</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Banking Association allowed banks and shops to obtain inter-industry drafts on July 4, these draft notes have been circulating in the market. Draft certificates will be issued when needed. The Draft Preparation Inspection Committee will be established soon, with the first inspection scheduled for the end of July. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Committee Members Presumed</p>
<p>The total amount of inter-industry drafts obtained by various banks and shops from the Bank Preparation Association is 50 million yuan in national currency, which is already circulating in the market. Various industries have found it convenient. Regarding the establishment of the Draft Preparation Inspection Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has nominated Xu Jiqing, the Bankers' Association has nominated Qin Runqing, the Foreign Bankers' Association has nominated He Bosi Gen, and the Banking Association has internally decided on Wu Yunzhai. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China will jointly nominate one representative. Once the representatives of all groups have been nominated, the committee will be established immediately. The first draft preparation inspection is scheduled for the end of July. At that time, the number of drafts obtained and the types and amounts of collateral will be announced separately.</p>
<p>Draft Certificate will be issued if needed</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance of draft certificates, reporters from the New Voice Agency learned from the Bank Preparation Association yesterday that the implementation of obtaining inter-industry drafts has been quite effective. There have been no difficulties in the exchange of inter-industry drafts. Since the original purpose of issuing draft certificates was to facilitate the exchange of inter-industry drafts, it is believed that there is currently no need to issue draft certificates again. However, a draft of the simplified rules for issuing draft certificates has been prepared. If issuance is needed in the future, the draft rules will be submitted to the Standing Committee for approval and implementation. The draft rules stipulate that the face value of draft certificates will be divided into four denominations: 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Evaluation Committee Members to be Separately Hired</p>
<p>The Bank Preparation Committee has separately hired Chinese and foreign experts from the industry's factories, real estate companies, China Business Company, New Feng Foreign Firm, Anli Foreign Firm, and Mager Foreign Firm to evaluate the value of the property provided by various banks and shops when obtaining inter-industry drafts. It will also be divided into (1) Real Estate Share, (2) Securities and Stock Share, and (3) Goods Share. Each share will have a chairman, who will also be a member of the committee, and several members, who will be assigned by various companies. If the market price of goods whose value has been evaluated falls, collateral may be reclaimed at any time.</p>
<h3>Implementation Difficult in Lost Areas; No Foreign Exchange for Prohibited Goods; No Transshipment to Non-Lost Areas via Mail; Paper Industry Requests Accommodation for Goods Stopped Midway</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the measures prohibiting imported goods, the Inspectorate General of Customs has ordered customs offices in various regions to implement them. Currently, except for customs offices in the lost areas, where implementation is difficult due to special circumstances, all other customs offices have implemented the measures since the date of arrival of the order. However, foreign exchange is not provided for prohibited goods, and transshipment is not allowed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>No Foreign Exchange Given to Prohibited Goods</p>
<p>Prohibited imported goods include luxury goods, semi-luxury goods, and non-essential goods, totaling 18 groups and 234 tariff items, such as foreign wine, white sugar, canned food, meat dishes, fruits, vegetables, wine, beer, spirits, drinking water, tobacco, as well as toys, silk fabrics, wool and cotton fabrics, wood, paper, bamboo, wood, rattan ware, and stone products. Currently, customs offices in non-lost areas have strictly implemented the measures, while implementation is difficult in lost areas due to a lack of authority. However, the Chinese government does not provide statutory foreign exchange for these prohibited goods, and they can only be purchased on the black market. At the same time, transshipment is absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Import and Transshipment via Postal Packages</p>
<p>Goods prohibited in non-lost areas, whether imported by postal package from overseas, imported by postal package from domestic ports, or transshipped by postal package from domestic ports, are all prohibited. However, if it is for the purpose of regulating market prices in the rear, supplying special uses, or there are other legitimate reasons, and it is approved by a government agency, the Ministry of Finance may review the actual needs and issue a purchase and transport permit. After the implementation of the above prohibition measures, the adverse trend of international balance of payments can be reversed, the overall trade deficit can be gradually reduced, and the Japanese plan to massively dump goods in China and obtain foreign exchange can no longer be implemented.</p>
<p>Paper Industry Requests for Accommodation</p>
<p>The Shanghai paper industry has stated that some types of paper are also included in the list of prohibited imported goods announced by the Ministry of Finance. However, before the announcement of the measures, the industry had a large amount of paper in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which was being transported to Haiphong and then transshipped to Kunming. Due to transportation difficulties in Haiphong, some goods have been piled up there for three to four months, and some for eight to nine months. If some of the goods are on the prohibited list, the customs office will not allow import when they arrive in Kunming, resulting in a great loss. The industry has sent a letter to the Inspectorate General of Customs asking if the customs office has any supplementary measures for the above situation, such as issuing a visa to allow goods stopped midway to be handled separately.</p>
<p>Essential Items Supplied as Much as Possible</p>
<p>Regarding the import of essential goods, the New Voice Agency learned from the banking sector yesterday that after the Ministry of Finance approved the supply of statutory foreign exchange, the Foreign Exchange Review Committee has been established in Chongqing. If various industries want to apply for foreign exchange, they must apply to the committee in Chongqing in accordance with the regulations of the ministry. It is reported that the place of transport is limited to non-lost areas, and a balancing fee for the difference between the legal price and the posted prices of the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications must be paid. As for the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai, the British-owned Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation will temporarily maintain it, but there will be restrictions on swaps to prevent manipulation by speculators.</p>
<h3>French National Day Celebration Program Same as Last Year with Grand Military Exercises</h3>
<p>Continental Daily reports that the French Concession is preparing to celebrate the 150th anniversary of French National Day on July 14th. Hundreds of coolies are already at work. Avenue Joffre's French police station and the Public Works Department Building have been decorated with flagpoles and lanterns. Due to the current situation in China, the French authorities did not hold the usual large-scale celebration last year, and this year's celebration will be the same. However, this only applies to the public celebration. The French community and their friends will still hold banquets and receptions. The celebration program will be the same as in previous years. First, a flag-raising ceremony will be held at the French Consulate General on Friday morning. In the morning, there will be grand military exercises in the French Park. Troops from the French police station and the local French garrison will participate. Formal receptions will be held at the French Consulate General, the French General Assembly, and the French Billiards Association, with the one at the French Billiards Association being the grandest and most lively. In the evening, the usual dance party will be held at the association.</p>
<h3>Empress of Asia Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>Changxing Company's Pacific Line, the postal ship Empress of Japan, departed from Shanghai for Hong Kong and Luzon on the 28th of last month. It has now returned from Luzon and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 5:00 PM today, docking at the Gonghexing Wharf. Details were reported in this newspaper yesterday. Now, it is learned that the company's postal ship Empress of Asia, which departed from Vancouver via Honolulu, Japan, etc., on the 24th of last month, is expected to arrive in port tomorrow (the 10th) at 1:00 PM, also docking at the Gonghexing Wharf. Passengers will transfer to a small boat and disembark at the new customs wharf at about 2:30 PM. The large ship is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai for Hong Kong and Luzon at 2:00 PM on Tuesday (the 11th). The last small boat for seeing off guests will depart from the new customs wharf at 12:30 PM on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Swedish Ship Xinanli Ordered to Return by Japanese Warship; More Than Ten Passengers and Comprador Detained in Daishan; Warship Orders Ship to Stop and Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Swedish company Ruifeng Foreign Firm's ship Xinanli departed from Shanghai for Dinghai and Daishan on the 6th of this month. However, when it arrived in Daishan on the 7th, the comprador Mr. Dong and 16 passengers were detained, and the ship was forced to return to Shanghai. Dozens of passengers from Dinghai returned to Shanghai on the same ship and are negotiating with the company for refunds. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Passengers on Xinanli Detained</p>
<p>After Japanese troops landed and occupied Daishan, Shenjiamen, Dinghai, and other islands in the Zhoushan archipelago, all foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Dinghai-Ningbo-Dinghai route, such as the Hana, Gaodeng, and Tianbao, suspended their services. In this situation of complete traffic disruption, a Swedish company called Ruifeng Foreign Firm rented a ship called Anli Marler from Marler Company, renamed it Xinanli, and operated on the Shanghai-Dinghai route, also stopping at Daishan. It is reported that they had reached an agreement with the Japanese side in advance and had a guarantee from the head of the Daishan puppet "Maintenance Association," Huang Bohe. The ship set sail from Shanghai for the first time on the 6th of this month and arrived at Dongshajiao in Daishan on the 7th, where it dropped anchor and stopped. At that time, 13 passengers from Daishan boarded a barge to land, but they were detained by the Japanese troops in Daishan. The ship then sent comprador Mr. Dong and translators to explain, but they were also detained (it is said that they have been released). Meanwhile, a Japanese warship sent troops to board and search the ship, forcing it to leave and not remain there.</p>
<p>Prevented from Docking in Dinghai, Forced to Return</p>
<p>At that time, the person in charge of the ship also went to visit the puppet "Maintenance Association Head" Huang Bohe to request assistance, but Mr. Huang was not in Daishan and was said to have gone to Dinghai on "official business." Therefore, the ship immediately set sail for Dinghai. However, when it was approaching the Dinghai port, it was suddenly stopped by a Japanese warship, ordered to stop, and thoroughly inspected. After the inspection, it was instructed to return to Shanghai immediately, and all passengers were refused permission to land. The ship had no choice but to return on the same ship and arrived in Shanghai at about 10:00 AM yesterday, mooring at a pontoon in the Huangpu River. Dozens of passengers from Dinghai were all aggrieved and complained, negotiating with the company for refunds. According to reporters from Daguan News Agency, it is not yet decided whether the ship will sail again in the future.</p>

<h3>Second Batch of American Wheat Shipped; Warm Enthusiasm from All Sectors in America Unceasing; Quantity Similar to Last Time, Still Unloaded in Shanghai; Allocated Entirely for Refugee Relief According to Previous Methods</h3>
<p>The American wheat donated to Chinese refugees, the first batch of 24,000 bags of crushed wheat, weighing 3,360,000 pounds, was transported to Shanghai on January 9th of this year by the transport ship Sa Hu Kela. It was allocated by the Shanghai Advisory Committee of the American China War Relief Association according to urgency. Now, it is learned that the second batch of American wheat has also been shipped to China, with the quantity roughly equal to the last time. It will still be unloaded in Shanghai and handed over to the Shanghai Advisory Committee of the China War Relief Association for allocation. Like the first batch of American wheat, in addition to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and the Nanshi refugee area receiving it for relief, severely affected areas in the interior will also be allocated. In addition, American commercial organizations and charities have also donated condensed milk, milk powder, canned food, and medical supplies, which are being shipped to China together, demonstrating the warm sympathy of the American people for the suffering Chinese refugees.</p>

<h3>Chaotic Situation in Tonghai; War Has Not Stopped; Japanese Troops Attack Chinese Army Positions at San Chang; Chinese Battalion Resists and Fights Four Times</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, after repeated failed attempts to invade Haimen, Japanese troops launched an attack on Haimen in a joint land and sea attack on the morning of the 6th. The Chinese troops stationed there were prepared and counterattacked separately, launching a fierce battle. The war has not stopped to date.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops From San Chang Jointly Invade East</p>
<p>The war between the Soviet and Japanese troops in Tonghai and other places in northern Jiangsu has not stopped to date. On the 5th, a Japanese army unit of more than 200 people, carrying sharp new weapons, led by puppet police and puppet self-defense forces, advanced in three routes with four armored vehicles and two tanks along the Tonghai Highway, and joined more than 60 Japanese troops stationed in San Chang to attack eastward, attacking the Chinese army positions at Tangjia Town, Yulong Bridge, Gujiayuan, and other places from the side. Japanese warships fired from outside the port of Xingang, and the roaring artillery fire was endless.</p>
<p>Chinese Battalion Charges and Engages in Hand-to-Hand Combat</p>
<p>The Chinese army stationed there, only a battalion of a certain regiment of a certain column, although outnumbered, all officers and soldiers in the battalion were exceptionally brave. Under the command of the battalion commander, they went out of the trenches for bayonet warfare, charging several times, falling one after another. The position was lost and regained four times. As the fortifications had been destroyed by Japanese artillery fire and there was a risk of being surrounded, they retreated to the four villages of Koukou Town to reorganize and replenish their strength.</p>
<p>Adverse Situation, Japanese Troops Retreat</p>
<p>The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses in this battle. A large team of puppet self-defense forces, carrying many weapons, scattered and fled during the battle. The Japanese puppet troops, seeing the adverse situation, retreated to San Chang on the night of the 6th. Currently, fierce battles are taking place in the area of Xisan Yuzhen. The situation is chaotic.</p>
<h3>Fewer Japanese Warships in the East China Sea; Coastline Bombed Again; Strict Precaution in Qianjiang</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the number of Japanese warships in the East China Sea has decreased recently, but seven or eight Japanese warships are still anchored off the coast of Wenzhou, Yueqing, and Yuhuan, and three Japanese warships are in the waters of Dinghai. Apart from occasionally bombing various coastal areas, there have been no changes. Therefore, the situation in various parts of eastern Zhejiang is still peaceful.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb</p>
<p>The shipping industry has learned that on the 7th, twelve Japanese bombers dropped bombs in batches on the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, including Zhenhai and Cixi. Details of the losses are unclear. Three Japanese warships were anchored off the port of Liqu, Zhenhai on the morning of the 7th, but there have been no unusual movements.</p>
<p>Qianjiang Precautions</p>
<p>In Qianjiang, although Japanese warships have frequently passed by in recent days, there has been no movement. Currently, five Japanese warships are anchored in Hangzhou Bay. The Chinese army is taking strict precautions on the south bank of the Qiantang River.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants Continue to Order Saigon Rice; Totaling 600 Tons, Now Shipped; Rice Prices Fall Back; Source Increases</h3>
<p>The Shanghai food problem, previously due to manipulation, caused prices to soar, breaking the 24 yuan mark, causing public anxiety. Small-scale commoners suffered terribly. During this time of scarcity between harvests, although domestic reserves have decreased and rice exports are banned, the source has been affected. Fortunately, Shanghai rice has been purchased and hoarded in large quantities, and reserves are</p>
<p>Extremely Abundant</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are still about six to seven hundred thousand bags, enough to supply the city for three months, so the overall food situation is not a cause for concern. Moreover, the authorities in the settlement and the rice industry groups have set price limits for the highest grade of white rice and the middle and lower grades of rice. The New Voice Agency learned yesterday from Daffu Foreign Firm that a large amount of foreign rice had previously been purchased, but due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the price doubled, causing a telegram to be sent back to withdraw the order. Now, a small number of food merchants in Shanghai have again entrusted Daffu Foreign Firm to order some Saigon rice for shipment to Shanghai for regulation. It has now been completed.</p>
<p>Number One Saigon</p>
<p>600 tons of foreign rice, about 6,000 bags (large bags), is priced similarly to the Shanghai rice price limit, about 21 yuan per bag. The shipping has commenced from Saigon and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of July. The source of domestic rice has recently increased, with five or six boats arriving by river and three or four thousand bags by land and water, totaling about 10,000 bags. Recently, the summer season has arrived, the market sentiment has stabilized, hoarders have stopped, and the market price has fallen back. A total of more than 3,000 bags were traded in the market this morning.</p>
<h3>Lihe Moufu Wheel Steamed to Ningbo Yesterday; Transshipped Into Port Outside Zhenhai Kou; Deping Wheel Did Not Open to Ningbo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lihe Foreign Firm's shipping department's Moufu wheel steamed to Zhenhai at four o'clock yesterday morning. Deping wheel did not set out. The details are given as follows:</p>
<p>Moufu Sails to Ningbo</p>
<p>Moufu wheel, with 200 passengers, and passengers and goods, steamed to Ningbo from Shanghai at four o'clock yesterday morning. It is expected to arrive at the Qilizhen sea surface outside the Zhenhai estuary at more than three o'clock in the afternoon of the same day. Starting at five o'clock in the evening, a rented Ningbo inland river vessel, Yongan wheel, dragged a barge and sailed out of the exit. In the estuary, transhipping the passengers and goods into the port, and then at the Zhenhai terminal, it was dragged to Yong by a deeper draft wheel, Jingsheng wheel, from Yong. The same ship loaded with Shanghai local products to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Transshipment Situation</p>
<p>The Ningbo defense department has approved the export of the old, weak, women, and children, and issued passes, which is more convenient than the time of war, so the wheel will bring a large number of passengers when it comes to Shanghai this time. Considering that the wheel has difficulty taking care of the luggage of passengers, they have booked a joint transport method for luggage, whether from Shanghai to Ningbo, or from Ningbo to Shanghai, the wheel is responsible, and the mother does not need to take care of it herself. The De Ping wheel did not steam to Ningbo yesterday, because it is still in the application for approval, and it is scheduled to sail on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Exports of Native Products Reaches Post-War Record; Tung Oil, Tea, and Hog Bristles Under Unified Control for Marketing; Significant Increase in Export Volume After Barter Trade Agreements</h3>
<p>In order to promote the export of native products and increase foreign exchange reserves, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated measures for settling foreign exchange for export goods and receiving exchange rate differences. It has also designated tung oil, tea, hog bristles, and minerals as four categories to be purchased and marketed under the unified control of the Trade Commission. This is because agreements have been made with the Soviet Union, the United States, and others for barter trade or designated as collateral for debt repayment. The following is a record of the export amounts from January to May:</p>
<p>Tung Oil</p>
<p>Quantity: 198,603 metric tons, valued at 18,094,038 national currency, equivalent to 7,552,876 customs gold units. Of this, 182,048 metric tons were destined for Hong Kong, valued at 17,062,436 national currency. These shipments of tung oil were transported to Hong Kong via the new South China transportation routes for centralized export, with the largest amount being shipped to the United States. The selling price of tung oil for export in Hong Kong is approximately HK$90 per picul.</p>
<p>Tea</p>
<p>Quantity: 81,573 metric tons, valued at 6,032,815 national currency, equivalent to 2,516,152 customs gold units. Of this, 45,386 metric tons were destined for Hong Kong, valued at 3,563,093 national currency. The Trade Commission has stipulated that exports be centralized through Hong Kong. This year's production in various regions is higher than in previous years. Tea farmers are currently busy roasting new tea, and it is expected that there will be a large number of exports after May.</p>
<p>Hog Bristles</p>
<p>Quantity: 12,325 metric tons, valued at 12,539,194 national currency, equivalent to 5,230,748 customs gold units. Of this, 3,373 metric tons were shipped to Hong Kong, valued at 2,534,802 national currency; 3,847 metric tons to the United States, valued at 6,036,449 national currency; 1,909 metric tons to the United Kingdom, valued at 1,972,400 national currency; and 2,365 metric tons to Germany, valued at 1,377,686 national currency.</p>
<p>Minerals</p>
<p>Total value: 39,054,507 national currency, equivalent to 16,296,991 customs gold units. Of this, shipments to Hong Kong were valued at 19,481,104 national currency, and shipments to Annam were valued at 12,230,156 national currency. Mineral sands are important raw materials for military needs. In recent years, due to the increasingly tense global situation, various countries have been actively preparing for war and have been purchasing mineral sand raw materials from China, with Germany being the largest buyer. After the war, China has actively developed its mineral resources, leading to a sharp increase in production.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>In addition to tung oil, hog bristles, tea, and minerals, the government has specifically permitted merchants to freely export other native products. In addition to exempting taxes and duties, providing insurance against war risks, facilitating transportation, and easing financial constraints, designated agencies are also making every effort to purchase these products to increase exports. At the same time, permission is granted to receive the exchange rate difference. Therefore, the export of native products is bound to increase sharply as a result. In May, the total value reached 83,784,000 national currency, setting a post-war record. Regarding transportation issues, the government is now seeking new routes.</p>
<h3>Luen Cheong Labor Strike Reaches Stalemate; Absurd Demand for "Strike Expenses" of 500,000; "Saboteurs" Should Bear Full Responsibility - No Problem Between Workers and Factory</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Press, it was learned from reliable sources yesterday (July 7th) that the labor dispute at the British-owned Luen Cheong factory in Pudong has not yet been resolved reasonably. Only the Luen Cheong Company and the workers can immediately resolve their disagreements. However, "saboteurs" are hindering the ongoing negotiations between the company and the strikers. In fact, the company has agreed to all the conditions proposed by the workers, except for one. Currently, negotiations have reached a stalemate. The prominent point of contention that the company has so far refused is the "request" to give the workers 500,000 yuan for "expenses incurred during the strike." Company personnel find this "request" quite ridiculous and say it is incomprehensible how the strikers could have spent such a large sum of money. Furthermore, the company has clearly stated its position: it refuses to "subsidize" a strike instigated by agitators. Another condition requested by the workers is a 12% wage increase, to which the company has actually agreed. The company has already proposed a plan to increase the workers' wages by 19% per month. The other two conditions requested by the workers were already implemented even before the strike.</p>
<p>These two conditions are: (1) Employees are entitled to one week of leave after marriage; (2) Pregnant female workers are entitled to one month of leave before childbirth. According to the report, the informant criticized the strike, saying that a small number of workers at the Luen Cheong Printing Factory demanded a wage increase and went on strike in early May. This partial strike escalated into a general strike on June 10th, ten days after Ding Geller was attacked and subsequently died. At the same time, a strike also broke out at the Luen Cheong Textile Factory on May 20th, apparently instigated by "saboteurs" in Pudong.</p>
<p>This strike, along with the agitators' intention to start a general strike in the textile factory, directly led to the attack on Ding Geller. Both the textile factory and the printing factory have been closed since June 10th. When reporters inquired about whether it was true that workers were mistreated by Russian guards employed by Luen Cheong Company, the informant replied that this was an unfounded accusation. The accusation may have arisen because workers living in Puxi often competed to board the company-provided sampans to cross the river, leading to disputes with the guards at the riverside. The guards, in order to prevent accidents caused by the sampans, often have to ensure that the sampans are not overloaded, which is a safety measure and cannot be regarded as mistreatment of workers. It is claimed that workers who do not cooperate with the agitators are not allowed to return to work, and the company has suffered huge losses since closing the two factories. The Luen Cheong Printing Factory was established in 1927 and is equipped with the latest equipment. In 1934, the Luen Cheong Textile Factory was also established in Pudong, with 44,000 spindles and 1,130 looms, capable of producing 680,000 yards of fabric per week. This strike involves a total of 3,000 workers, including 2,300 workers from the textile factory and 700 workers from the printing factory. The former mostly consists of female workers, while the latter mostly consists of male workers.</p>
<h3>Design Promotion of Small-Scale Industries</h3>
<p>The National Government's Ministries of Economy, Education, and Interior are jointly promoting the design of small-scale industries to increase production capacity. The Committee for Promoting the Design of Small-Scale Industries has been organized and is now actively working on related design matters, including: (1) Defining the procedures for promoting small-scale industries; (2) Allocating locations for the widespread establishment of small factories; (3) Implementing basic vocational education in different regions; (4) Introducing and training talent for small-scale industries; (5) Providing incentives, subsidies, loans, and assistance for small-scale industries; (6) Designing and supplying equipment for small-scale industries, whether using completely manual, semi-manual, semi-mechanical, or mainly mechanical methods. The committee believes that small-scale industries are most needed in the inland provinces today and occupy a major position in wartime industry. It constantly seeks the opinions of experts and strives to assist in promotion.</p>
<h3>Charity Tea Dance Party Changes Organization, Adds Committees to Strengthen Forces, and Prepares for Reopening</h3>
<p>The Charity Tea Dance Competition organized by the Dance Hall Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association was announced to be open from July 1st. In order to enrich its ranks and expand its forces, the association, after gathering and discussing with various responsible persons, decided to make slight changes to its internal organization. Therefore, it is announced that the event will be temporarily suspended from July 7th. It is now planning to establish a Sponsorship Committee, inviting leaders from all walks of life to serve as committee members; (2) the Venue Affairs Committee will invite dance hall managers and dance troupe leaders to serve as committee members, and will be responsible for arranging red star rotating dances; (3) the Entertainment Committee will invite film industry personnel to serve as committee members, and will be responsible for the entertainment activities of the conference to increase enjoyment; (4) the Publicity Committee will invite editors and reporters from major and minor newspapers to serve as committee members, and will be responsible for all publicity matters of the conference. It is reported that the above-mentioned measures are currently being negotiated and implemented separately. Once the arrangements are properly made, the event will be reopened with a new look.</p>
<h3>Mail to Foreign Countries Should Use the Language of the Destination Country; Parcel Delivery to All Parts of Sichuan Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration issued Notice No. 1557 yesterday, stating that, according to Article 16 of the Postal Regulations, the name and address of the recipient on mail sent to foreign countries should be written in the common language of the destination country. If it is only in Chinese, it must be accompanied by a Roman transliteration. Hereafter, senders sending mail to foreign countries must strictly comply with these regulations to avoid difficulties in delivery in the destination country. This notice also informs that the Parcel Service Department has also issued two notices: (1) Due to transportation difficulties, parcel delivery to all parts of Sichuan, except for personal and medicinal parcels, is temporarily suspended; (2) Effective immediately, all bulk small parcel mail to all parts of Sichuan is temporarily suspended. Medicines and personal items will be accepted as usual. It is understood that the acceptance of large and small parcels to Kunming, Yunnan, and counties and towns along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway will resume next week.</p>
<h3>Street Vendors Near Julu Road Petition the Taxpayers' Association</h3>
<p>There are more than 100 vegetable stalls and peddlers in the area of ​​Julu Road in the French Concession. They usually pay monthly license fees to the French Concession Tax Bureau and set up stalls for business according to their numbers. However, this month, about 100 new licenses were suddenly added, making it impossible for the original vendors to settle down and forcing them to suspend business. The old vendors specially sent representatives Li Yichen, Wu Rongsheng, Zhu Gaolin, Wu Jinbao, and Wu Shunji to petition the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting them to negotiate with the French authorities to transfer the licenses of the new vendors to other places. The secretary of the association received them and promised to report the matter and handle it impartially.</p>
<h3>The Huangpu River Has Not Been Dredged; Flood Prevention Work This Autumn Is Important; Heavy Rains at the Beginning of the Month Have Caused Flooding That Has Not Yet Receded; The Riverbed Is Getting Higher Every Day, and the Flow Is Not Smooth</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this month, from 0:00 on the 1st to 2:30 pm on the 3rd, due to heavy rain, the roads were flooded into canals. This flooding has not yet receded. For example, in Xuhui's Route Tenant de Villiers, Rue Contaut, Route Heger, and other places, the slow drainage is unprecedented. The reason for this is that the Huangpu River has not been dredged, the riverbed is getting higher every day, and the water flow is far less smooth than before. Therefore, the accumulated water on the ground cannot be quickly absorbed by the drains and discharged into the river. Even if it enters the river, it cannot flow smoothly out to sea. Therefore, according to this situation, Shanghai may have a fairly serious flood around the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. At that time, the tide will be high, and it will also be the rainy season. It will also coincide with the typhoon season. If these three factors coincide, then the impact on Shanghai's floods will be considerable. Therefore, the flood prevention work of warehouses and godowns this year must not be neglected.</p>

<h3>Famous Jockey Tong Zhenyuan Sued for Assault by His Wife; After Reconciliation, More Problems Arise; After Persuasion, Tong's Wife Withdraws the Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Tong Zhenyuan, a famous jockey from Ningbo, is 36 years old. In 1927, he married Zhang Guomei (now 33 years old), a woman from the same hometown, and they have a son and a daughter. The daughter is 11 years old, and the son is only 4 years old. Later, Tong became fond of travel, which led to frequent quarrels within the family. They have been separated since 1936. Zhang lived with her father-in-law, Tong Wenbin (73 years old, owner of the Yichang Construction Company), at No. 3, Lane 929, Xinza Road, while Tong lived with his brother, Tong Zhenhu, at No. 24, Haifang Village, Haifang Road. This avoided conflict. In January of this year, Tong filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special First Court to request cohabitation with Zhang Guomei. During the trial, after mediation by the judge and friends, a settlement was reached with the following conditions: (1) Zhang Guomei should cohabit with Tong Zhenyuan at No. 24, Haifang Village, Haifang Road; (2) Tong Zhenyuan should abide by the legal system of one husband and one wife; (3) Tong Zhenyuan should pay Zhang Guomei 100 yuan per month for living expenses; (4) Tong should not abuse Zhang; (5) If Zhang Guomei encounters Tong Zhenyuan violating the settlement conditions, she may return to live at No. 3, Lane 929, Xinza Road.</p>
<p>The case was then concluded, and Zhang moved to No. 24, Haifang Village to live with her husband. However, on the afternoon of the 29th of last month, Zhang suddenly reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, saying that at 12:30 pm, during lunch with her husband, they had a quarrel over living expenses. Tong Zhenyuan then assaulted her, causing her injuries. She requested an investigation. Chinese Detective Tao Genrong and Detective Du Guozhen sent Zhang to the hospital, where it was confirmed that she had indeed sustained injuries to her left cheek. Tong was summoned to the police station. According to Tong's statement, Zhang had first thrown a rice bowl at his face. Since Zhang insisted on pressing charges, but Tong had a confirmed address, he was allowed to leave. A warrant was then issued by the Special First Court, and both parties were summoned to the Third Criminal Division of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Judge Huang Risheng opened the trial. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts and charged Tong with assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Huang briefly questioned both parties about what happened, he persuaded Zhang Guomei, saying that since the injury you suffered is very minor, in order to avoid breaking the relationship between husband and wife, it is better to withdraw the case. If the defendant must be punished, it will only increase resentment and make it difficult to hope for reconciliation. Therefore, for the sake of your lifelong happiness, it is better to withdraw the case. Lawyer Li also advised her. Zhang then indicated that she was willing to withdraw the case, but requested that the court reprimand the defendant and warn him not to be violent again in the future. Judge Huang approved this, reprimanded Tong Zhenyuan, and then announced that the case would not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Rotating a Car Engine Results in Fatal Abdominal Injury</h3>
<p>Gu Shou, a 32-year-old employee of the Huafu Transportation Company from Yangzhou, residing at No. 5, Lane 455, Hankou Road, was preparing to drive his old car near the lane entrance at around 7 pm the night before. Unexpectedly, the choke valve was difficult to depress, so he got out of the car and inserted the iron crank handle in front of the car to rotate the motor. However, after shaking it violently to the right, he accidentally lost control, and the crank handle suddenly recoiled violently to the left, causing the handle to hit Gu's abdomen, recoiling several times and injuring internal organs. He immediately turned pale and collapsed to the ground in pain. He was sent to the hospital for treatment but died at 3:30 am yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>A Woman Addicted to Gambling Sues Her Sister-in-Law for Defamation</h3>
<p>Huang Zijian, from Fujian, currently works at the Chongqing Aviation Administration, participating in the war effort. His wife, Huang Lansheng, 34 years old, lives at No. 9, Jianye Li, Fuli Road, Muqiao. Because of his wife's misconduct, Huang Zijian instructed his cousin, Huang Xizhao (36 years old, residing at No. 1283, Route Lafayette), to monitor her. Huang Lansheng, because her husband was far away in Chongqing, became addicted to Huahui gambling. Therefore, Huang Xizhao sent a letter to her cousin Huang Zijian in March of this year, revealing the improper private life of her sister-in-law Huang Lansheng. Huang Lansheng, after receiving a letter of reprimand from her husband, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Huang Xizhao of defamation. The case was heard by Judge Jiang in the Second Criminal Division yesterday morning, and both parties confronted each other in court, each with their own arguments. The court persuaded them to reconcile, but failed. After the arguments were presented, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled the verdict for July 15.</p>
<h3>Robbery at a Cigarette and Candy Store; One Thief Shot; Stray Bullets Injure Two Passersby</h3>
<p>At around 5:15 pm yesterday, the Youli Candy and Cigarette Store at No. 1279, Yuyuan Road, was suddenly robbed by three bandits. One of the bandits was armed and grabbed all the business income from the store's cash register, totaling 20 yuan in legal tender, and fled. As they left the store, the owner and apprentices shouted "Catch the robbers!" At that time, Patrolman No. 2795, No. 2189, and a Japanese detective No. 1789 were patrolling the area. Hearing the alarm and seeing people running in panic, they immediately gave chase and ordered them to stop. The bandits were desperate and continued to run. The detectives and patrolmen then opened fire. The bandits also fired at the police. After chasing them to the vicinity of Hengchang Li, the armed bandit was finally shot down and captured on the spot, and a pistol was seized. The other two bandits had escaped. The captured bandit was taken back to the police station. He identified himself as Li Zhiming, but he was seriously injured and was first sent to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, two passersby were injured by stray bullets. One was Zhu Xigao and the other was Tian Junqing. They were also sent to the hospital for treatment after the incident.</p>
<h3>Child Drowns While Swimming</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the weather has suddenly become hot. North Jiangsu children who live on boats are often seen swimming in the Suzhou River west of the Shancha Shipbuilding Plant and the area between Xinqiao and Youdaijiao. Yesterday (July 8) at around 2:00 pm, a group of North Jiangsu children were swimming naked on the banks of the Suzhou River near Youdaijiao. At that time, the tide was rising and ships were traveling westward one after another. One of the children, about eight or nine years old, was unable to cope after being in the water for too long and tragically drowned. The other children discovered this and searched for him everywhere at the bottom of the river, but could not find him. They then ran to tell his parents, who immediately drove a boat to search everywhere. They soon found him floating on the surface of the river about a mile west of Youdaijiao, but it was too late. The child's mother held the corpse and wept bitterly, which was very sad.</p>
<h3>New Factories Continue to Increase, Industrial Situation Improves Significantly, Some Factories Automatically Increase Workers' Wages, Very Few Fresh Cocoons Arrive, Affecting Silk Reeling Factories</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section reported that the number of new factories under design in Xuhui last month was still considerable. The more important ones included two lead oxide and lead acetate manufacturing plants, one weaving mill and one cannery each, and two silk thread factories and two glass factories each. Forty-six new factories that had started operations were inspected, with yarn factories being the most numerous. Several factories located elsewhere have added branch factories in the eastern district of the city due to a shortage of raw materials. Recent additions include one hat factory, one oxygen factory, one motor assembly factory, one soap factory, one elastic band factory, and one medical cotton factory each. Recently, very few fresh cocoons have arrived, which has a significant impact on the future operations of silk reeling factories. If the blockade of various ports in eastern Zhejiang is implemented, the source of fresh cocoons will become even scarcer, and both silk reeling factories and silk weaving factories will be affected.</p>
<p>Working Conditions</p>
<p>One large yarn factory has seen significant improvements in its industrial conditions and the living conditions of its workers. The factory now stops work for half an hour every afternoon to allow workers to rest and drink tea provided by the factory. Thirty new shower heads are being installed, and once completed, workers will have the opportunity to shower regularly for free. The factory roof has been insulated to reduce the temperature inside the factory by six degrees Fahrenheit at all times. Wages have been increased by 8% since June. The factory also purchases rice and sells it to workers at a price of four yuan less per picul than the market price. In addition, several factories have also increased workers' wages by 10% to 20% depending on the cost of living.</p>
<p>Group Training</p>
<p>Last month, 70 boiler operators and supervisors from 53 factories received four hours of training per week in the northern district, led by two Chinese boiler engineers. The teaching methods used have proven to be quite effective. The owners of small light bulb factories held a second meeting to discuss the work standards they intended to try. The owners of leather factories also held a meeting and decided to dig a deep well for the use of 13 leather factories. The second meeting will discuss the issue of setting up a sedimentation tank.</p>
<p>Labor Disputes</p>
<p>The Industrial Section mediated two labor disputes.

<p>Cost of Living</p>
<p>The overall cost of living index for workers in Shanghai has continued to increase this year. In June, it reached as high as 176.15 (using the overall index of 1936 as the base). This number is 6.84% higher than the previous month, 15.48% higher than the same month last year, and 76.15% higher than before the Shanghai War. In other words, one yuan of national currency before the Shanghai War was only worth a little more than 56 cents last month. All types of indexes, except for clothing, have risen sharply.

<h3>Dispute over Property Division Leads to Elder Brother Being Pushed to Death. Death From Pushing Caused Hemoptysis Due to Lung Disease. Police Report and Seal Coffin Awaiting Examination and Verification.</h3>
<p>Fan Siyu, a Chaozhou native residing at No. 23 Yuerli, at the intersection of Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, is 33 years old this year. He has four brothers. Siyu is the eldest. The second brother is Sili, 27 years old this year. The third brother is Sihong, the same age as Sili, and the youngest brother is Sizhang, 24 years old this year. Their father has passed away, and their old mother is still alive. However, Siyu has been suffering from lung disease for more than ten years. The old mother lives with Siyu, while the other brothers live separately and cook for themselves. Recently, due to a property dispute among the brothers, Siyu hid the old mother at a relative's house, preventing her from meeting with the other brothers. At 7 pm on the 6th, Sili, Sihong, and Sizhang, the three brothers, demanded from their elder brother Siyu that he hand over their mother and divide the property, leading to a verbal argument. Sihong and his younger brother pushed Siyu hard in the chest, causing Siyu to cough up fresh blood. His wife, Guo, hired a car to take him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The hospital, upon learning that Siyu had been injured and coughed up blood, reported it to the French police as a matter of routine. Police officers were dispatched to investigate and waited for him to recover before handling the case. Unexpectedly, Siyu died at 9 pm that night. The family did not report to the police but took the body to the Shanghai Funeral Home, where the body was placed in a coffin at 5 pm on the 7th, preparing to send it out for burial and temporarily store it at the Guotai Coffin Storage on Daxi Road yesterday. Sili, Sihong, Sizhang, and the other three brothers believed that their elder brother Siyu was killed by them and asked someone to mediate a settlement with their sister-in-law. In the morning, they hired a lawyer to represent them and submitted a request to the French General Police Station to close the case. The police considered that Fan Siyu died as a result of injuries and had not been reported beforehand, and it was inappropriate to request a closure of the case afterward. They dispatched investigators and sent Fan Siyu's coffin to the Coroner's Office for autopsy. Because there was no time to complete the autopsy procedures yesterday, they will summon the family members of the deceased and the accused to the case on Monday and request the Second Special Court to send personnel to open the coffin for examination to clarify whether the deceased died as a result of injuries, and then deal with it accordingly.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Actively Carries Out Mosquito and Fly Eradication, Installs Larval Traps, and Uses Mosquito-Eating Fish and Larvicides.</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Health Department of the Public Concession is quite concerned about the progress of summer epidemic prevention and malaria prevention. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Epidemic Prevention and Fly Eradication</p>
<p>The Health Department has added various testing stations and branches to inject epidemic prevention vaccines for residents of the concession. In addition, doctors and nurses are now dispatched to inject vaccines on various roads. In terms of fly eradication, several places have installed traps for fly eggs and larvae. However, this is a trial measure, and it is difficult to determine its effectiveness in the future.</p>
<p>Malaria Prevention and Mosquito Eradication</p>
<p>In terms of malaria prevention, the Health Department discovered 43 breeding sites for malaria mosquitoes in the previous month, 21 of which were in privately owned gardens. The breeding sites were in ornamental stagnant ponds. Therefore, the Health Department used mosquito-eating fish and larvicides, which were placed in the ground or sprayed, with good results.</p>
<h3>The Old Stage's Bad Habits, A Flower Gambling Den Busted, The Main Culprit Jumps Out of Window and Gets Injured.</h3>

<h3>Absurd Leaflets Discovered in Various Locations in Western Shanghai</h3>

By the time the police heard the news and dispatched officers, these people had already disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3>French National Day, French Park Not Open</h3>

<h3>Dissatisfied with Parents' Arranged Marriage, Young Woman Sues for Cancellation. Defendant Requests Dismissal of the Lawsuit.</h3>
<p>Huang Xuedi (22 years old this year), a woman from Dongting Mountain currently residing at No. 19 Zhufan Xinli, Xinzha Road, was engaged to her fellow villager Zheng Lingen (24 years old this year) on April 13, 1937. Since the two parties had disagreements, the wedding was never held. Now, Huang Xuedi believes that marriage is a major event in life and demands marital autonomy. She recently hired lawyer Wang Kanghou to file a lawsuit with the civil court of the Second Special Court, requesting confirmation that the engagement with Zheng Lingen was invalid, claiming that it was arranged by her mother and she did not agree to it. The court accepted the case and summoned the parties to the seventh courtroom yesterday for trial by Judge Li Liang. The defendant, Zheng Lingen, did not appear in person but hired a lawyer to appear in court, stating that the engagement was initiated by the plaintiff Huang Xuedi with the tacit consent of her parents. The plaintiff herself signed the engagement document in her own handwriting, so how could she overturn it at will? He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The plaintiff insisted that the engagement was forced by her parents when she was a minor and could not be recognized, because acknowledging it would forever ruin her happiness. After reviewing the arguments, the court ordered a debate and then announced the conclusion of the trial, setting July 12 for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Most Corpses of Those Who Died in the Concession Are Exposed.</h3>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I am writing to you regarding a news item in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on July 5, regarding the case against Minghe Factory. The content is slightly inconsistent with the facts. The plaintiff, my client Liang Yongao, has presented the stack receipts of Minghe Factory as evidence of the defendant Wang Zuolin's misappropriation of stored yarn. The defendant not only failed to provide evidence of delivery, but also claimed that Xue Jinman handled the matter, which is just empty talk and has no legal basis. Therefore, the court ordered the defendant to pay 8,000 yuan as security. Moreover, there is no mention of Xue Jinquan being a shareholder of Yunhua in Wang Zuolin's confession. The information in your newspaper must be due to reporter's error or someone's instigation with ulterior motives, all of which are sufficient to confuse the public. Therefore, I am writing this letter to correct it. I hope that you will publish this letter in the "Letters" column of your newspaper. Yours sincerely, Sun Zhongyao, Lawyer, July 8.</p>
<p>Correction. In the news item "A Large Number of Treasures Stolen from the Residence of the Director-General of the Four Lines Depository" published in our newspaper on July 5, according to the staff of the Four Lines Savings Society, there is no position of Director-General in the Society's depository, and an inquiry of the depository staff has revealed that there is no concubine named Ye living on Shanzhong Road. We have been instructed to make a correction and publish it above.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Qualifications, Appointments, and Salaries of National Higher Education Faculty (Part 1) – During the Late Qing Dynasty, Listed as Civil Servants and Controlled by the Government – After the Republic, Universities Established Professorships, Assistant Instructors, etc.</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The qualifications of faculty and staff in national higher education institutions (including universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools) have not been clearly surveyed in recent years. According to the Ministry of Education's 1934 statistics, among the 7,205 faculty members, 3,856 had studied abroad, 2,667 had graduated from domestic higher education institutions, and 56 had graduated from secondary schools. Among the 5,332 staff members, 1,148 had studied abroad, 1,913 had graduated from domestic higher education institutions, and 1,113 had graduated from secondary schools. The evolution of faculty qualifications, appointments, and salaries can be divided into three periods, which are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Guangxu Era of the Late Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>The Outline of Academic Affairs in the 29th year of Guangxu stated: "At this time, universities, higher schools, and ordinary schools in provincial capitals may still hire teachers from various Western countries." It is evident that in the early stages of establishing schools, the majority of faculty in universities and higher schools were foreign hires. Although officials were sent abroad to study at the time, it was not sufficient to meet the urgent need. The outline also stipulated that "From now on, all teachers in schools inside and outside the capital should be civil servants, known as teachers, and subject to the jurisdiction and control of the school's supervisor and headmaster. Their merits and demerits should be assessed and they should be promoted or demoted accordingly. They should not be treated as honored guests as in the past, as this would cause many obstacles. However, supervisors should also treat teachers with courtesy." This was the initial regulation on granting official titles to teachers and on their promotion and demotion. It also briefly regulated the term of office for teachers, "Whether it is three years, two years, or based on the graduation period of the school, those who are incompetent should be dismissed at any time, those who are excellent may be retained after the term expires, and those who are average should be replaced on schedule. They may not resign or seek other positions before the term expires." The regulations for faculty in universities were further systematized in the regulations for teachers in universities. Universities established a General Supervisor, equivalent to the current president, and Divisional Supervisors for each department, equivalent to the current deans. Under the Divisional Supervisors, there was "one Director of Academic Affairs, appointed from the most learned of the regular faculty members," "Regular faculty members were responsible for teaching specialized courses in the various departments, instructing in academics and guiding research," "Assistant faculty members assisted regular faculty members in teaching students and guiding experiments." Higher schools also had supervisors and deans, as well as regular and assistant faculty members. In summary, the regulations for faculty in universities and higher schools at the time only provided general regulations on titles, responsibilities, and terms of office. Detailed regulations on faculty qualifications, appointments, salaries, and professional development had not yet been established.</p>
<h3>The China Society of Natural History Opens Its 14th Annual Meeting – Awards Zhu Yuanding Medal</h3>
<p>The 14th Annual Meeting of the Peking Society of Natural History was held at the Auditorium of Peking Union Medical College on the morning of April 15th. Due to the national crisis, a banquet and refreshments were not prepared. Professor Wei Dunrui, the president, presided over the meeting. The honorary secretary and honorary accountant reported on the society's affairs and financial situation. The chairman reported on the results of the election of new members and officers, as well as the activities of the publications department. Mr. Jin Shuchu, the founder of the society, established the Jin Family Gold Medal in memory of his respected father, Mr. Qin Yuan, and his wife. The medal is awarded annually to Chinese and foreign scholars who have made outstanding achievements in the study of Chinese zoology and botany. It has been awarded every year since its establishment without interruption. In the past, most of the recipients were in Peiping. This year, upon the recommendation of Dr. White, the medal was specially awarded to Professor Zhu Yuanding, Head of the Biology Department of St. John's University in Shanghai, to commend his contributions to the study of Chinese fish. Lectures were held in the afternoon. The newly elected officers are listed below: President, Li Ruqi of Yenching University; Vice Presidents, Bolari of Yenching University, Feng Lanzhou of Peking Union Medical College; Secretary, Zhong Huilan of Peking Union Medical College; Treasurer, Wu Zhaofa of Fu Jen Catholic University.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Reviews the Qualifications of Teaching Staff – To Improve Primary School Teaching</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Education Department believes that the academic knowledge and experience of teaching staff at all levels of schools is critical to the advancement of education. The department plans to conduct a strict review of the qualifications and experience of the staff of its affiliated and subsidized schools during this summer vacation in order to actively improve the future of primary schools in Shanghai. It is reported that the department has been planning various registration forms and is expected to announce them soon.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Closely Monitors Beverage Supply in Summer Schools – Many Chinese Children Suffer from Diphtheria and Typhoid Fever</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department in the International Settlement is paying close attention to the supply of beverages in the summer schools that are being operated during the hot summer months. According to the latest statistics on infectious diseases among students in the department's affiliated and subsidized schools, mumps are prevalent among Western children, while diphtheria and typhoid fever are more common among Chinese children due to seasonal factors.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Grants Approval for Establishment of Zhaoguang Middle School</h3>
<p>In view of the high cost of living in Shanghai, the plight of impoverished children unable to continue their education is regrettable. A group of enthusiastic educationists in Shanghai have joined forces with prominent figures in the business community to prepare for the establishment of a middle school, named Zhaoguang Middle School. The tuition fee for the entire senior high school is only 15 yuan, and only 13 yuan for the junior high school, which is the same as the tuition fee for provincial middle schools in the past. The Ministry of Education approved the establishment of the school because its fees are very low, which is in line with the aim of helping young people who have dropped out of school. Preparations are now complete, and recruitment advertisements have been placed in newspapers. The temporary office is located at No. 304 Pudong Fellow Association on Avenue Foch. All matters will be handled there before August 1st. At the same time, because the school does not admit many students, children from wealthy families are asked not to apply, so as not to occupy the places of others.</p>
<h3>Free Schools Established by the Out-of-School Relief Center</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center has spared no effort in promoting free education throughout the city. The first phase of work at the center has come to an end, and the second phase has begun. Based on the outline for the implementation of free education at the National Education Conference, it was decided to divide the city into ten districts, with a free school established in each district, in order to provide widespread relief. It is reported that four schools in the British Concession officially started classes on July 1st, and two schools in the French Concession will start classes as soon as the French Municipal Council issues permits.</p>

<h3>Finance: Yinghui in Tianjin Contracts – Northern Traders Suddenly Purchase Gold – Prices Rose to Around 2,600 Yuan After Closing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market was relatively weak during the morning session. Although Hong Kong traders were still interested in buying at the beginning, the eagerness of cash dealers and money changers to sell led to a decline in the market, which once fell to 2,573 yuan. At noon, Tianjin traders suddenly entrusted a certain money changer to aggressively buy at the low, and the market turned firm, rising back to 2,577 yuan at the close. Due to the foreign exchange market being closed on Saturday and the hot weather, it was decided to close the market in the afternoon. However, there were sudden rumors that the foreign exchange market in Tianjin was contracting sharply, and that the British gold had softened to four and a half pence. As a result, the local traders were even more eager to buy, and they entrusted securities dealers and a certain money changer to inquire with various firms over the phone. It was heard that transactions were once made at 2,585 yuan. Later, due to the scarcity of sellers, the price rose to around 2,600 yuan, so no further transactions were made. As a result, the official price fell by five cents, but in reality it rose by seven or eight yuan. The price of jewelry gold at silver shops remained unchanged. The prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Market Drops Officially But Rises Unofficially</p>
<p>From the morning, Hong Kong traders showed strong buying interest, causing the underlying momentum to be quite stable. The market opened 1.5 yuan higher. A certain gold firm bought 50 taels each from money changers and cash dealers on behalf of Hong Kong traders, both at a price of 2,579 yuan. However, due to the increasing selling intention of cash dealers and money changers, the supply temporarily exceeded the demand, and the price fell by 3 yuan in an instant. A cash dealer sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop (on behalf of Hong Kong traders), at a price of 76 yuan. A money changer also sold 50 taels to a securities dealer at the same price. The price then fell another yuan, and the money changer sold 40 taels to a cash dealer, at a price of 75 yuan. Shortly after, the price fell another 2 yuan, and a certain cash dealer sold 10 taels each to a gold firm and a fellow dealer, and 30 taels to a certain silver shop, all at a price of 73 yuan. At this time, Tianjin traders suddenly entrusted a certain money changer to purchase on their behalf, and the market suddenly rebounded. A certain money changer bought 50 taels each from a silver shop and a cash dealer, still at a price of 73 yuan. The price then rose by 2 yuan, and a certain money changer bought 50 taels from a fellow dealer at a price of 75 yuan. At noon, the price jumped another 2 yuan, and a certain money changer bought another 50 taels from a fellow dealer, with 77 yuan as the noon closing price. After the closing, Tianjin traders were still interested in buying, but there was no intention to sell, so no transactions were made. Due to the foreign exchange market being closed on Saturday and the hot weather, the traders decided to close the market in the afternoon. It was heard that Tianjin traders were even more eager to buy, and they entrusted securities dealers and a certain money changer to buy more, inquiring with various firms over the phone. It was heard that a certain money changer bought 50 taels from a cash dealer on behalf of Tianjin traders, at a price of 85 yuan. After that, the selling intention was very weak, and some sellers even asked for a price of 600 yuan, making it difficult to trade. As a result, the official price at the noon closing price of 2,577 yuan fell by five cents, while the actual price based on over-the-counter transactions rose by 7.5 yuan, fluctuating by 6 yuan in half a day. The cash dealers' standard gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot market, and the current margin gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with no transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold in silver shops remained unchanged. Datong Bank still listed 261 yuan, and Xin Tongxing Bank listed 259 yuan for selling and 253 yuan for buying.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 7th reported that the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce. As a result, the Central Bank's Chinese cash buying price remained at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of customs gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Speculators: Roll August into July - Futures Arbitrage Temporarily Without Cash - Still Quoted by Banque Belge and Banque Franco-Chinoise - July Market Suddenly Tightens, Spot Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC quotes remained unchanged except for a slight increase of .25 for Hong Kong dollars. Spot trading in British and American currencies remained stable and quiet. Although foreign firms attempted to buy and foreign banks absorbed shillings midway through, British and American banks showed strong willingness to supply, coupled with exporters also selling, resulting in balanced supply and demand, and prices remained flat. The July futures market was also very stable initially, but weakened slightly at midday. Since the opening of August futures trading the day before yesterday, futures swaps and arbitrage did not require cash. With twenty-three days remaining until the end of July, wealthy Chinese merchants rushed to buy July and roll out August, paying forward premiums of 203.125 shillings and 375 U.S. dollars. The Banque Franco-Chinoise and Banque Belge, among others, were offering these rates, using an interest rate of around 3%. With strong buying pressure in July, the market suddenly softened. Although foreign firms and Sassoon &amp; Co. attempted to buy August futures, foreign banks and speculators sold more aggressively. After initially strengthening, the market returned to flat by midday. Spot prices and July swaps widened again, with premiums of 15.625 British pounds and 28.125 U.S. dollars. Since interest rates were low (just over 2%) and cash was needed, no one considered arbitrage. Trading was brisk for half the day. The Hong Kong dollar situation remained unchanged.</p>
<p>This morning, London telegraphs showed a decrease of .0625 for near-term large bars, with no change for far-term. New York silver prices were unchanged, and London gold also saw no changes. Exchange rates: British pounds rose .6 hao against the U.S. dollar and were unchanged against Shanghai currency. The British pound rose 1 sheng against the French franc. The U.S. dollar remained flat against the British pound, Shanghai currency, and the French franc. Central Bank quotations for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 6 shillings 5.5625 pence for British pounds and 12.78125 yuan for U.S. dollars, unchanged from the previous close. After opening, exporters first sold to Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque Belge, and the Netherlands Trading Society, with spot U.S. dollar rates at 12.8125 yuan. Subsequently, import firms and the foreign-owned Banque de l'Indochine competed to buy spot British pounds at 6 shillings 5.5625 pence from HSBC. Then, a foreign firm bought spot U.S. dollars at 12.78125 yuan from Banque Belge. As a result, the process was stable. When HSBC's rates were announced, only the Hong Kong dollar rate increased by .25, with all other rates remaining unchanged. When the silver balancing tax was announced, it remained exempt. Later, futures trading was quite active. Banque Belge sold July British pounds at 6 shillings 4.6875 pence to Banque Franco-Chinoise (on behalf of Tianjin). Subsequently, Banque de l'Indochine sold July U.S. dollars at 12.59375 yuan to Banque Franco-Chinoise. There was some swap trading, with an American bank swapping July and August contracts with a Chinese merchant, with the American bank paying the Chinese merchant a premium of 375 U.S. dollars, equivalent to an interest rate of about 3% per month. Later, a foreign firm absorbed August British pounds at 6 shillings 2.1875 pence from British Bank of the Middle East, while Sassoon &amp; Co. also bought August U.S. dollars at 12.1875 yuan from speculators. The market remained quite stable. Near midday, there was only Hong Kong dollar trading, with the foreign bank Anta selling spot at 44.375 yuan, and the situation remained flat. At that time, the July and August markets weakened slightly as foreign banks' willingness to sell waned. By the afternoon close, bank spot selling prices were 6 shillings 5.5625 pence for British pounds and 12.78125 yuan for U.S. dollars. July futures were 6 shillings 4.0625 pence for British pounds and 12.5 yuan for U.S. dollars. August futures were 6 shillings 1.875 pence for British pounds and 12.125 yuan for U.S. dollars. In the end, compared to the previous night's close, spot British and American currencies saw no change. July British pounds were slightly tighter by .03125, and U.S. dollars were slightly softer by .0625. August British and American currencies remained unchanged. Hong Kong dollars, after being settled at the transaction price, also saw no increase or decrease. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Buyers Seek British and American Gold Notes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold and British and American exchange rates did not change. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms settled softly. Foreign banks supplied smoothly. Market prices were stable and unchanged. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. At the opening of Shanghai tael trading, money changers actively purchased, with the market price at a high of 2,579 yuan. Later, as gold shops increased their supply, the market price gradually declined, closing at 77 yuan at midday, a decrease of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Trading did not open in the afternoon. Demand from the black market was strong, with the market price at 2,594 yuan.

<h3>Japanese Copper Scrip in the Hongkou District</h3>
<p>Since the absorption of copper subsidiary currency in this city, it is unexpected that the Japanese "one-sen" copper coins (one sen is equal to one fen in national currency) circulating in Hongkou have also been decreasing daily. It is rumored that they are being collected as raw materials for manufacturing, replaced by newly issued "military scrip." The scrip is divided into three denominations: one sen, five sen, and ten sen. The design is smaller than our country's jiao currency notes. The front depicts a dragon and cloud pattern in brown and green. The back is written with the words: "This scrip can be exchanged for the Japanese currency amount stated on the front upon arrival. Any forgery, alteration, imitation, or knowing use will be severely punished." This means that the scrip can be exchanged for the currency amount stated on the front. Users who are forced to use it will naturally be aware of this. (This) is used as a printing plate afterward.</p>
<h3>Silver Price Decline Slows</h3>
<p>London, July 7th dispatch: Silver market speculators selling, India buying a small amount. The market is flat, and the closing price remains flat. There are a few who want to buy at a price .0625 lower than the posted price, but there are also transactions at the posted price. The near-term price of large silver bars continues to fall by .0625, while the far-term price is unchanged. New York silver telegram: U.S. spot prices are unchanged. Bombay silver telegram: The Indian silver market is calm. Spot and July prices are down by 3 annas, and August is also down by 5 annas. The total number of contracts traded is 150.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Decreases Again by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange-drawn bills slightly decreased. In the morning, it was initially 92.3 yuan per thousand, returning to 91 yuan at midday, and further decreasing to 90 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of one yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate at the Money Dealers Association remained unchanged at 2 jiao for both morning and afternoon.</p>
<h3>Coal: Indian Coal Arrives Today</h3>
<p>Indian coal continues to arrive in Shanghai. The "Baron Ardrossan," managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., carrying 572 tons of coal loaded from Calcutta, will arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, mooring at buoys 31 and 32 for unloading and transshipment. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Securities: The Seventh Interest Payment - A Mystery Within a Mystery - Public Debt Market - Nervous Sentiment</h3>
<p>Yesterday's over-the-counter securities market saw slightly anxious and uneasy sentiment. At the opening of trading, Class C bonds had already broken into the 9 yuan range. Later, with support from Xie Da, Datong, Yuyu, and others, they returned to and even surpassed the closing price of the 6th. The closing price was slightly soft. This volatility is due to the problem of the seventh interest payment, which has become a market mystery. Although various sources say that the payment will be made as scheduled, the Ministry of Finance has not yet made a definite statement. If the interest payment were to be made as scheduled, there would be no need for a statement. However, given the Reuters telegram and Minister Kong's recent pronouncements on financial policy, which did not mention domestic debt, people suspect ulterior motives. Furthermore, according to numerous rumors in the market, the government originally intended to temporarily suspend the due interest payment on the seventh public debt to ensure equal treatment for domestic and foreign debts. However, after requests from advisors, it agreed to temporarily have the Four Banks act as collateral. The detailed measures have not yet been determined. The reporter adheres to the principle of recording everything heard and will tentatively report what people are saying, awaiting confirmation of the facts. In short, in this uncertain and confusing situation, no one can make a definitive statement. According to the previous rumor of revised measures, there is reason to believe this is true. In short, the Reuters telegram is a mystery, and whether the interest payment will be made is also a mystery. Everyone thinks it's a mystery, and since they are unwilling to reveal this mystery, it is a mystery within a mystery. Both large and small speculators are taking advantage of the opportunity. Yesterday, Lianhe first sold and then bought, and Tiansheng first bought and then sold, showing uncertainty. At the beginning, Runli, Renchang, and others sold Class C bonds, retreating to the 9 yuan range. Later, Xie Da, Datong, Yuyu, Tong Guangshunheng, and others successively bought, while Tongshunxingyuan and No. 25 supplied a large amount, so the closing price was not much different from before. Class A, B, and E bonds were slightly better by 2 or 3 jiao, Class C bonds were unchanged, and Class D bonds were down by 1 jiao. Highs and lows alternated, and volatility was uncertain. The trading volume was over 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A	60.40	60.00	60.40	Up 0.30</p>
<p>Unified B	51.25	50.90	51.25	Up 0.25</p>
<p>Unified C	49.70	48.90	49.60	Flat</p>
<p>Unified D	48.90	48.60	48.70	Down 0.10</p>
<p>Unified E	49.35	48.70	49.35	Up 0.20</p>
<p>Stock trading: 60 shares of Great China Match Company stock were traded at a price of 12.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Public Industries Association: Yesterday's stock market remained largely unchanged, but the underlying trend was good, and trading was sluggish. Jardine Matheson shares remained stable, trading at 18.8 yuan. Wheelock Marden shares saw slightly more demand at a price of 35 yuan. Telephone shares continued to advance, rising to 11.7 yuan. 5.5% Electricity Bonds rose slightly to a price of 82 yuan.</p>
<p>London, British-owned Far East companies stock prices on July 7th (Friday): All stocks were stable, and prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, Chinese foreign debt prices on July 7th (Friday): Only the Hukuang Railway bonds fell by 1 pound each. The German Development Bank bonds with Indian stamps were priced at 15 pounds, and the German Development Bank bonds with Indian stamps were priced at 13 pounds. The rest were unchanged. Crisp bonds were quoted for sale at 22 pounds, a decrease of 0.5 pounds from the market. Real goods were offered for sale from London, including 5,000 British pounds of Tianjin-Pukou original loan bonds, priced at 13 pounds, an increase of 1 pound from the market. Also, 5,000 pounds of Sino-French-American 5% dollar bonds (equivalent to 25,000 U.S. dollars), priced at 42.5 pounds.</p>
<h3>Grain: Flour - Officially Firm, Unofficially Soft - Japanese Merchants Continue to Buy New Wheat</h3>
<p>Flour: The spot flour market continued to be quiet. Customer transactions have been suspended for many days. Although there have been sporadic transactions recently, there have been no wholesale transactions. This is all affected by the cash problem. Factories still adhere to the cash price of 4.65 yuan, and only a few hundred bags of recycled goods are traded at around 5 yuan, which is unofficially several fen to 1 jiao softer than the factory price. It was recently heard that the Beiyang merchants had bought a little, and together with the retail transactions in this street, there were a total of 20,000 bags traded. The future market prospects remain largely unchanged. Today, 90 bags of flour will be shipped to Qingdao.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the supply of new wheat was not large. The main sources were still Jingzhen, Sudan, and other places. At present, the selling price in various production areas is difficult to relax, and cash is required for procurement. Therefore, traders are not as enthusiastic as in the past, and sellers are holding on. The market is stable. Unified market sales opened at 6.9 jiao for Suzhou Daqiao wheat, 8.5 jiao for Dachang wheat, and 7.5 jiao for Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Danyang wheat. 900 bags were traded, still purchased by local merchants and Japanese merchants.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Supply Exceeds Demand - Prices Increasingly Unsustainable</h3>
<p>Du japonica: After falling for three consecutive days, yesterday the sales market in this street was even more sluggish. Inland merchants were also watching, causing sellers to shout even lower prices. The decline in all goods was unabated. Thick and thin japonica are prone to deterioration during this hot weather, so the market has a large inventory, showing a situation of supply exceeding demand. The market price fell by another 2 jiao. The routes for Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian are also relaxed, and prices also decreased by 1 or 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Bianyuan: Has become a complete failure. The market price fell by another 2 jiao. According to statistics, the city only received nearly 1,000 bags of Fengjing Bo rice. The number of transactions was still no more than 4,000 dan. Today is Sunday, and the rice market is closed.</p>
<p>Customer indica: There was a new arrival recently, but the inland merchants' buying interest has waned. They even stopped buying for a while yesterday morning, and then purchased small amounts at lower prices, making the purchase price even more stringent. However, sellers were very willing to sell, and some merchants also wanted to sell, so the market price was reduced by about 2 jiao. After the price was lower, local merchants started to buy more, so the number of transactions for the whole day was still about 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign rice: The market was quiet again yesterday. Recently, rumors in the market have repeatedly said that Saigon No. 2 rice has been continuously ordered, and the industry is quite weak. The current Saigon rice at 23 yuan is mostly watched by incoming merchants.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Beans - Fluctuating Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grains market was quite lively due to the market being closed on the previous day. As for the yellow bean market, prices fluctuated. Dalian Sipingjie beans have been purchased since the previous price drop, and some Xichang merchants have been interested, so the market price has rebounded by 6 or 7 fen, with 7 cars traded. The price started at 9.6 yuan and rose to 9.7 yuan. Wuhu beans also rose by 5 fen, with over 100 bags purchased by merchants in this street at a price of 9.45 yuan. However, Hankou beans continued to fall by 6 or 7 fen due to oversupply, with 1,500 to 1,600 bags traded at a price of 8.6 yuan with tax and 8.7 yuan delivered, and a tax-free bid price of 8.52 to 8.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Tianjin Red Dates Under Control - Shanghai Goods Transferred to Tianjin for Storage</h3>
<p>Tianjin red dates' production prices are high because they are controlled by a certain party. As the goods in Shanghai are often moldy and cannot be stored for long, to avoid spoilage, they will be transferred to Tianjin for storage, as the north has no mold and is suitable for long-term storage. As a result, the goods in Shanghai are gradually becoming scarce, and prices have tightened again. Yesterday, red date king was sold at 80 yuan, red date heads at 65 yuan, head-grade red dates at 55 to 50 yuan, and second-grade red dates at 38 to 39 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Operators Are Bullish Again - Cotton Yarn Price Decline Abates - Yesterday's "Swap" Transactions Accounted for Over 1,000 Bales</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially declined and then rebounded, but the price decline has abated. This is because Nanhua and Hong Kong merchants continue to actively purchase, stabilizing sentiment, and those with sufficient capital are coming back to buy, with bullish sentiments. As a result, inter-dealer trading is particularly prosperous. As for customer sales, apart from purchases from Hong Kong, there is no other demand, which is due to transportation issues.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the yarn market was sluggish due to unfavorable conditions. Small traders sold slightly, and Hong Kong merchants bought slightly. The opening price fell by 2 to 3 yuan. 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods were 477 yuan. Warehouse receipts were more expensive, but buyers were not enthusiastic. After a while, rumors spread that Hong Kong merchants were buying strongly and constantly purchasing coarse yarn, boosting confidence and tightening the market. Prices rose slowly. In addition, various parties reorganized and purchased hundreds of bales of warehouse receipts and spot goods, making the market look dry. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods was 483 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 477.5 yuan. After those who profited sold, the price retreated by 2 yuan, and the closing price was 480.05 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 476.5 yuan. A total of 1,610 bales were traded throughout the day, and inter-dealer "swap" transactions accounted for 1,070 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 1 yuan, and other prices were largely unchanged from the previous day. The price of 20-count wool-blend yarn rose by 3 yuan. Today, 130 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Tianjin, and 65 bales will be shipped to Yantai. The amount purchased by each port is listed below:</p>
<p>Dealers: 1,070 Hong Kong: 485</p>
<p>Quanzhou: 115 Inland: 30</p>
<p>Total: 1,610</p>
<p>Latest news: According to some discussion, the news reported in this publication that a large number of cotton yarn exports would be shipped to various places on the 8th, with a total of 3,070 bales, aroused the curiosity of speculators, who speculated that the large sales volume would likely lead to price increases in the market next week. As a result, traders' buying sentiment suddenly became fervent before the close, and the market price turned from low to high.</p>
<h3>Cotton Trading Stalls - Industry Hopes Banks Will Accept Collateral</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market was active again yesterday. In the morning, the purchase from overseas cotton merchants and large inter-dealer transactions led to a high demand. Prices were further increased due to the elevated prices sent through telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai. There was a strong request that the banking sector take part in the market. As such, prices continued to rise due to high spot prices. Today is the first harvest estimate report for American cotton. Currently, the area planted is expected to be 25,411,000 acres, and the total production is expected to be 11,608,000 bales. Yesterday, New York rose 14 pounds, India, including forecasts, rose 2 rupees, and Egypt rose more than 20 pounds.</p>
<p>Trading in Shanghai's foreign cotton is becoming quieter, due to the tight money supply. It is rumored that the banks will accept cotton collateral next week. If this is true, then the cotton market may loosen slightly. However, the period for bulk orders is still far away. Recently, cotton merchants have deliberately delayed payments, which is not to the satisfaction of foreign firms. It is said that new transactions will require full payment before the order is signed, so future transactions will be much more difficult.</p>
<p>Transactions of Chinese and foreign cotton have stopped. The cotton that was purchased is arriving in large quantities, ready to be delivered. However, the buyers lack cash and cannot withdraw the goods. As a result, new transactions have completely stalled. As for the source of local cotton, it only relies on northern Jiangsu, but the amount is very small. Yesterday, 510 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock, as well as 565 bales from Beisha. Some spot cotton is being traded in rice.</p>
<h3>Speculators Refuse to Give Up - Cotton Yarn Market Struggles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai cotton yarn spot market has been quite chaotic since the Ministry of Finance restricted deposit withdrawals, and there is a tendency to collapse. Many parties are taking advantage of this opportunity to stop trading. Although the industry once convened a meeting, the result was not much help, and over-the-counter transactions began. Seeing this situation, some retailers settled their positions, causing the market price to fall. Rumors of "circulating currency" and "treasury certificates" resurfaced, with differing opinions. Buying sentiment suddenly became fervent, jumping 20 yuan. 20-count Double Horse returned to the 500 yuan mark. Many people thought that the banks would open up after the mid-year settlement and that there would be a turnaround. Unexpectedly, the 50 million yuan exchange certificates from the banking and money industries began to be registered, and the financial situation was exceptionally stable. Gold fell, foreign exchange was extended, and securities flourished, indicating financial stability. A cloud of doubt was dispelled, greatly disappointing many parties. When the market opened, it not only failed to expand but contracted. However, wealthy individuals and collapsed households in banks still did not give up, so the market was soft but firm. However, in the past two days, a group of small merchants have been redeeming from the bank, coupled with the expensive exchange premiums, forcing them to cut their positions in the market. At the same time, customer demand was sluggish, so the market became stagnant and shifted downward, with a feeling of decline. However, the psychological attitude of large accounts is still bullish, arguing that all ports are currently closed, transportation is difficult, and the road is narrow, so future hopes are far away. Because the coastal defense has changed to a free port, the only transportation channel in the future will be to transport goods from Mazhang (near Guangzhou Bay). It is also said that Myanmar can also be connected, so the future is still optimistic, and yarn sales will develop indefinitely. However, this kind of ideal is feared to be too early to coincide with reality. Currently, the amount of yarn in the hands of merchants that has been used for collateral is not small, and the purpose is to wait for a good price to sell. Most of them were absorbed at high prices. If the date is long, the warehouse rent, insurance, and dismantling interest will increase. Secondly, if real sales are not smooth and the money is not loose, the goods issued by the factory in the past will gradually approach the deadline, and the factory will inevitably urge delivery. At that time, it is possible that the root problem will be solved. The fundamental issue still lies in the struggle for actual digestion. (Jin)</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cakes: Industry Silver-Futures Agreement Reached - Oil Market Turns Prosperous</h3>
<p>Soybean Cake: The market (closed on the previous day), today is Sunday, so transactions were concentrated yesterday, resulting in higher prices for various oilseed cakes. 4,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cakes opened at 3.06 to 3.08 yuan, more than 10,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand cakes rose from 3.045 yuan to 3.065 yuan, and 10,000 pieces of Tianjin soybean cakes were opened at 3.07 yuan, an increase of 4 to 5 fen compared to before the holiday.</p>
<p>Oil Market: The market was even more active yesterday, because the industry's problems concerning the selling and buying of silver futures responsibilities have been resolved (detailed in this publication on June 29). The Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Cake Industry Association has filed and maintained a 10-day silver futures market, which gives both buyers and sellers considerable room to maneuver, resulting in greater trading and market prices rising. Peanut oil rose by 0.5 yuan, with 200 units of Jiaozhou raw oil traded at 34 yuan, 100 units of coming-from-warehouse raw oil at 34.4 yuan, and 100 barrels of Dalian barrel raw oil at 45 yuan. Soybean oil rose by 8 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the previous market, with a total of 2,300 to 2,400 units of various oils traded (market prices are detailed in the market price column). The destinations were local, inland, Yangtze River, and Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Market Prices Downward - Mill Cloth Increased Prices - East Cloth Fell Further with No Transactions</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market continued to decline. Selling was done to ease the urgent need for silver. Some retail customers cut losses at reduced prices, revealing low prices. However, due to cost issues, mills required all goods to be priced at least 1 yuan higher than the market price per piece, which was difficult to accept. Therefore, most merchants remained calm and continued to buy and stock up on cheaper goods. As a result, the decline in cloth prices was slow. Selling was very chaotic. Yesterday, prices continued to fall by 5 fen to 2.5 jiao per piece. Spot sales were scattered. Merchants along the Jinpu Railway in Yanshi, Shangqiu, and Xuzhou bought over 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored serge, printed straight tribute twill, and Cantonese merchants bought over 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored serge, and colored patterned cloth. Over 20 packages of fine twill, Yunnan merchants bought over 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, flannel, and serge. Large Pengfei Hong and other brands of fine cloth and twill were 50 packages. Local merchants searched for 50 to 60 packages of fine twill, and dyeing factories also bought over 100 pieces of lower-grade Changzhou fine twill. Retail transactions of cut pieces in northern Jiangsu traded over 1,000 pieces of spun silk and colored cloth. Overseas purchases by Singapore and Little Luzon continued to be strong. Bleached, dyed fine twill and fine cloth traded over 1,000 pieces.</p>
<p>East Cloth</p>
<p>The market for white fine twill remained sluggish and declined further yesterday, with prices continuing to fall by 1 jiao to 2 jiao. Spot goods of Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 13.6 yuan, and futures fell to 13.75 yuan. Most people in the industry were pessimistic, so the more the market price fell, the fewer transactions there were. The situation of depression is difficult to change for the time being.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>Today, 15 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Yantai, and 20 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin. However, 200 pieces of piece goods were shipped from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sales Season Not Yet Arrived, But Horsehair Sleeve Linings Are Already Being Bought - 23 Cases of Wool Yarn Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Horsehair sleeve linings: Recently, local merchants have been collecting them because they are aware that the sales season is approaching. Since the reduction of foreign exchange and restrictions on deposit withdrawals, small marine households have seen a sharp increase in raw materials and a lack of currency head linings, making it difficult for them to develop as before. Therefore, many are buying in advance, and over 100 pieces have been traded. Prices are mostly kept secret. It is said that the price of Grade 2 goods is 6 jiao 7.5 fen per yard in legal tender.</p>
<p>Also, 23 cases of wool yarn arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market: No. 24 raw granulated sugar, local warehouse goods were 29.8 jiao, foreign warehouse goods were 6 jiao, and transit goods were 21.4 jiao, with 1,100 bags traded, and 4.5 jiao for 200 bags. This is a rise of 1 jiao. According to a Dutch telegram, August was 8.6 jiao, and September-October was 8.25 jiao. A Hong Kong telegram indicated that the port charge for raw granulated sugar was 10.08 Hong Kong dollars. Tai B brand West warehouse goods were 30.06 jiao, the East warehouse bid was jiao, CW was 30.06 jiao, DY was 29.7 jiao, with a total of 600 bags traded. CX was 30 jiao, HX was 29.5 jiao, and H red was 21.5 jiao, all rising by 2 to 3 jiao. According to the London telegram, August was 8 shillings 0.25, down 0.125, December was 6 shillings 3.25 pence, up 0.25, and March was 6 shillings 4.25 pence, up 0.215. Dutch red, etc., remained largely unchanged. For domestic sugar, the Chao merchants opened 50 bags of cotton red at 22 yuan, 40 bags of ice flower white at 17.2 jiao, and 60 bags of Huizhou sub-white at 17.4 jiao.</p>
<h3>Metals 　 Zinc Sheets and Rivets Both Rise</h3>
<p>Zinc Sheets: Overseas transactions have not shown any development, and business for local factories is also sporadic, so the overall market trend feels stagnant. However, inventories are extremely low, and no new goods have arrived. Therefore, those holding goods have high aspirations and harbor thoughts of hoarding. As a result, asking prices are exceptionally high. For example, No. 2 is sold at 300 yuan per barrel, No. 3 is asking for 310 yuan, No. 5 is 195 yuan, No. 6 is 285 yuan, and Nos. 7 and 8 are both asking for 275 yuan per barrel. Other thick patterned varieties are asking for prices ranging from 300 to 320 yuan each. It was found that only 20 to 30 barrels were sold yesterday and the day before, with the varieties being No. 5 and No. 9. Buyers were battery factories and printing houses. Other tea companies, cigarette factories, toy factories, etc., rarely made purchases beyond inquiries.</p>
<p>Rivets: In recent days, the Tianjin suppliers have shipped as many as four to five thousand barrels. Furthermore, local hoarders and construction companies also have healthy appetites, leading to factory output not being able to meet demand. Moreover, raw materials (such as raw silk, etc.) have been extremely scarce in recent days. As a result, it is heard that certain factories are facing the risk of suspension due to a lack of raw materials. Therefore, factories and industry peers alike have very firm intentions, unwilling to compromise on selling prices. The asking price per barrel is 21 yuan, 25 cents higher than the selling price of the previous day. It is heard that financial magnates and money lenders have also been placing many orders recently, hence the market is lively and morale is high.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Demand from England and France for Green Tea is Constant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, green tea was being actively sought after by English and French trading houses due to urgent demand from abroad. However, factory output was limited, and supply could not meet demand, leading to firm confidence and rising prices. Yesterday, the whole city, including companies like Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and Wing On, purchased more than 800 cases of goods such as selected bud, precious eyebrow, and fine needle teas. Selected bud teas opened at 348 yuan, and standard precious teas opened at 290 yuan, an increase of 7 or 8 yuan compared to before. On the 8th, 310 pieces of tea leaves arrived from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Inspection of the New Capital Hotel</h3>
<p>— (Fan Meng)</p>
<p>Scheduled to Open on the 14th of this Month; Over Two Hundred Craftsmen Rushing Day and Night</p>
<p>More than a month ago, the New New Company decided to cancel its original amusement park and rebuild the current "New Capital Hotel."</p>
<p>At that time, I spoke with Mr. Xiao Zongjun of the New New Company about this issue. His reasoning was: rather than having such a half-dead, ordinary amusement park, it would be better to rebuild a venue more suitable for the enjoyment of the upper class. In the past, they themselves were dissatisfied with the various facilities in the New New Rooftop Garden, so they decided on this plan for the New Capital Hotel.</p>
<p>In the past few days, it has been said that the internal construction of the New Capital Hotel is almost complete, so I visited Mr. Li Ze, the general manager of the New New Company, and he told me that the opening date of the New Capital Hotel is:</p>
<p>"The opening date of the New Capital has been set for the 14th of this month, at which time we will not be preparing for excessive extravagance."</p>
<p>Mr. Li also introduced me to a Mr. Zheng Jiaju, who accompanied me on a full tour of the New Capital Hotel on the sixth floor. Before the New Capital opens, I will first outline a simple sketch for the readers here.</p>
<p>It is said that the total cost of this project for the New Capital Hotel is more than 100,000 yuan. It includes five venues on the sixth floor: (1) Chinese cuisine department and tea room; (2) Hollywood-style glass broadcasting studio; (3) Auditorium; (4) Cloud Dress Dance Hall; (5) Shanghai Opera Stage.</p>
<p>The seventh floor, which is the rooftop garden, has a Western cuisine department and a dining area converted from a grape trellis.</p>
<p>Except for the seventh-floor rooftop garden, which is not air-conditioned, the entire sixth floor is air-conditioned.</p>
<p>When we walked onto the sixth floor, I immediately smelled a strong, pungent odor of "polish" and paint. The floors were also covered with sawdust and wooden boards everywhere. It is said that one or two hundred masons and carpenters are now rushing day and night to ensure that the opening is scheduled for the 14th.</p>
<p>This entire sixth floor is quite spacious and high. In my personal estimation, its area is no smaller than the second floor of the Great East.</p>
<p>This part is mainly the Chinese cuisine department, although it is also a tea room. When we visited, almost all the tables and chairs had been arranged. Currently, they are rushing to complete the construction of several restaurants in the Chinese cuisine department.</p>
<p>Sixteen Advertising Restaurants</p>
<p>The unique feature of the New Capital Hotel can be considered these individually decorated restaurants.</p>
<p>There are sixteen of these restaurants in total, each contracted and decorated by a different store or factory. Therefore, changing restaurants is like visiting a new store.</p>
<p>For example, there is the Green Treasure Hall, the Star Hall, the Mayar Hall, and the Sinyi Hall, etc. The interior decoration is not only different in color but also completely different in style.</p>
<p>A new advertiser can attract their patrons anytime, anywhere. This kind of advertising-style restaurant in the New Capital Hotel seems to have also opened up a new path in advertising art.</p>
<p>A Transparent Broadcasting Studio</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the glass broadcasting studio:</p>
<p>This broadcasting studio does not occupy a very large space, but having such a transparent broadcasting studio in Shanghai's broadcasting industry can indeed be considered a first.</p>
<p>The glass broadcasting studio is located at the entrance of the elevator. There are four publicly broadcasted performances: (1) from 12:00 noon to 1:20 pm, the program is singing and dancing; (2) from 3:20 pm to 4:00 pm, it is the comedy of Jiang Xiaoxiao, etc.; (3) from 4:00 pm to 4:40 pm, it is female storytelling; (4) from 6:40 pm to 8:00 pm, it is the All-Star Singing Association.</p>
<p>Apart from these four times, the rest of the broadcasting is not public.</p>
<p>Now the Revolving Palace is Renamed Cloud Dress</p>
<p>I also visited the Cloud Dress Dance Hall and the Shanghai Opera Stage. The Cloud Dress Dance Hall is the former Revolving Palace Dance Hall led by Hai Lisheng. My impression of it is that the decoration is very exquisite, but not high enough. Inside, there are four long, recessed sofa chairs, reminiscent of the old Grand China Venus.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Opera Stage is the former Peking Opera Stage, now slightly renovated. The troupe is the well-known Xiao Wenbin.</p>
<p>The seventh floor is the rooftop, where the air is very smooth. It would be nice to catch some cool breeze up there at night. If you could see the night view of Shanghai from the restaurant converted from a grape trellis, it would also be a very interesting thing.</p>
<h3>Rice as Pearls, Firewood as Cassia, Vegetable Prices are High: Meal Delivery Companies Emerge</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Delivered on Time Regardless of Distance 　 Each Meal Ranges from Eight to More Than Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Rice costs more than 20 yuan per picul, pork costs one yuan for one catty and four ounces, and one corner of a yuan cannot buy one catty of green vegetables.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, after suffering from the problem of housing, the people of Shanghai are now facing the problem of eating. Even for a very small family, the food expenses are at least doubled compared to before the war, but even though the money has doubled, the food is not as plentiful as before.</p>
<p>Originally, cooking your own meals was cheaper and more delicious than eating delivered meals, but that is no longer the case. It seems that eating delivered meals is cheaper. Perhaps some people will doubt that the owners of meal delivery companies do not want to make money and are willing to take a loss, but I have my own point of view that eating delivered meals is cheaper than cooking your own meals under today's circumstances.</p>
<p>Just to give my own experience, cooking your own meals requires at least two piculs of briquettes per month. The current price is two yuan per picul, for a total cost of four yuan. The matter is even more complicated than that. The maid hired at home spends at least half a day busy buying vegetables and cooking. If you don't hire a maid, your wife has to cook and take care of the children, which is really too much. Perhaps this maid is mostly hired for cooking meals.</p>
<p>Now, hiring a maid costs at least five yuan per month, and with rice prices at more than 20 yuan per picul, the food probably costs more than five yuan, so hiring a maid costs twelve or thirteen yuan per month for wages and meals. If you eat delivered meals, although the food will definitely not be cheaper than buying and cooking it yourself, you can save two piculs of briquettes, and if the population is small, you can also save on hiring a maid. Wouldn't you save fifteen or sixteen yuan per month in your expenses?</p>
<p>Because of rice as pearls and firewood as cassia, some of my friends want to eat delivered meals to save on hiring a maid. However, as everyone knows, most of the general meal delivery companies are not very clean. Eating unclean food affects health, especially now in the normal summer season, when flies are flying all over the yard. Eating food cooked by other people is always a bit unsettling. Thinking about hygiene issues, even if you want to eat delivered meals, you will hesitate and still cook it yourself under severe pressure.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai is Shanghai after all. Now, some people have seen this point and opened a Shanghai Meal Delivery Company, which opened on July 1st. This meal delivery company is relatively large in scale and pays considerable attention to hygiene. If you order meals, they can be delivered on time regardless of the distance. The contact point is at 460 Chengdu Road, and each meal ranges from eight to more than ten yuan.</p>
<p>Meal delivery companies are undoubtedly a new business, and this new business can allow ordinary small families to save on hiring maids, save on buying briquettes, and reduce the severe pressure of living expenses. But our only hope is that this meal delivery company can truly achieve the goal of saving food expenses and ensuring the safety of life for the citizens, that all the food is cooked with attention to hygiene, and that the prices are reasonable. Then, this new business will surely have considerable development prospects.</p>
<h3>(2) On the Method of Doing Things</h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>The first thing to consider when doing anything is to establish a pure intention and a bright and upright purpose. A pure purpose is to people's actions what the soul is to the inner body, form to substance, the root to the trunk, the sun to the world, the source to the river, and the foundation to the pillar. A body without a soul is a walking corpse, substance without form is rustic and unrefined, a trunk without a root is a dead tree, a world without a sun is dark and lightless, a river without a source will soon dry up, and a destroyed foundation will cause the pillars to collapse. If the intention is not pure and the purpose is not bright, then the behavior will surely be base and unhelpful to others. To establish a pure intention, you must follow these suggestions: (1) Before doing something, you must think about its consequences and recognize what the purpose is. (2) When doing something, you should do it in the name of God, which means (1) you should not do anything that does not conform to God's truth. (2) When doing something, you should aim to glorify God; even if you do not see the glory temporarily, the result will surely glorify God. (3) You must not turn the original good intention into a malicious one. (3) Before starting a major undertaking, you must first pray, not only asking God to complete your undertaking but also asking God to accept what you are doing as a gift to God, in order to seek God's grace. (4) When doing things, you must always recite a few words from the Bible to prevent our pure intentions from changing. For example: "Lord, do not give glory to us, but to the Lord Jesus."

<h3>The Phantom of the Ancient Castle</h3>
<p>— Ru Hua</p>
<p>The Hound of the Baskervilles</p>
<p>Produced by 20th Century Fox 　 Shown at the Grand Light Theater</p>
<p>I have read many of Conan Doyle's "Sherlock Holmes Cases." I feel that in addition to portraying Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Watson as meticulous and courageous in resolving people's crises, the author also uses his scientific basis in each case to break many seemingly mysterious superstitions in the world. However, readers are often fascinated by his writing skills and neglect the author's intentions.</p>
<p>In "The Phantom of the Ancient Castle," the Baskerville family members were killed by hounds because people thought that the Baskervilles had committed crimes and therefore received their just deserts. Conan Doyle, through the great detective Sherlock Holmes, wrote a tortuous and bizarre story and ultimately revealed that the reason for the occurrence of this case was due to other social causes.</p>
<p>The "Phantom of the Ancient Castle" on the screen is quite faithful to the original.</p>
<p>The director's portrayal of the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Watson, in my view after reading Conan Doyle's original work, feels like Sherlock Holmes' pipe is always in his hand, and he deliberately plays his violin calmly during tense moments, and Watson's impersonation of Sherlock Holmes, etc., are all like the characters in the original work.</p>
<p>The three things that serve as important clues: the cane, the leather shoes, and the photograph, are all solemnly introduced by the director. The suspense created during their introduction is very clever. For example, when introducing the cane, he brings out Dr. James, but Dr. James does not appear in many subsequent scenes, and only when Henry Baskerville returns to the castle at the end does he specifically write about James driving the carriage away first. When introducing the leather shoes, he brings out a maid; when introducing the photograph, he uses Sherlock Holmes' tracking shot to show that he has discovered something in this photograph.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of terror also intensifies step by step. After Sherlock Holmes and Watson announce their return to London, the director's skill in writing about the development of all aspects at the same time is admirable.</p>
<p>This film also benefits greatly from the help of photography and sound. For example, when each suspicious character appears and in the surrounding environment of the wasteland, the angle of the camera and the light can be used to enhance the terror. When Sherlock Holmes follows the small path after the carriage overturns, the sound of the dog barking, from far to near, increases the tension of the atmosphere at that time.</p>
<p>Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes is played calmly and powerfully, and the guttural sound after disguise becomes very natural. Other actors such as Nigel Bruce as Watson and Lionel Atwill as Dr. James also work hard.</p>
<p>"The Phantom of the Ancient Castle" can be said to be a masterpiece in detective films.</p>
<h3>Fan Pages in Collaboration Between Xu Jilin (Calligraphy) and Ji Peng (Painting) Brothers</h3>
<h3>Biographical Sketches of Female Storytellers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Yan Lizhen, in his "Short Biography of Female Storytellers," refers to female storytellers as having four types of "art": Chen Zhixiang, Xu Baoyu, Wang Xueqing, and Yan Lizhen, and each is discussed in turn. He states, "Zhixiang's voice is clear and melodious, and she analyzes the four tones and seven sounds in detail. Her storytelling has almost been polished by talented scholars, surpassing the original legends. The words are elegant and the language is witty, captivating listeners. Her deliberate depictions are logical, emotional, lifelike, and divinely skillful. Baoyu is broad and unrestrained, with a heroic spirit. She can suddenly become hoarse and scolding, or suddenly funny and comical, better than watching a play, achieving unexpected victories, a separate school among women. Xueqing's narration is thorough and concise. Lizhen excels at painting sadness, conveying thousands of words in silence."</p>
<p>The introductions to each person's artistic achievements can be said to be very detailed. Among the four, Lizhen is the most famous, and her tone is the most "stable." The Han River guest once wrote a poem about her, saying, "Old generation of romantic Yan Lizhen, a glance on stage seems affectionate. People compete to listen to her Buddhist and secular tales, each word clear in the sound of strings," which is also an explanation of "stable." Wang Tao's "Maritime Amusements Record" once wrote a biography for her:</p>
<p>Yan Lizhen is from Suzhou. After the Taiping Rebellion, she moved to Shanghai. She is skilled in southern storytelling, unmatched by anyone in her craft. As she aged, her fame increased. She planned to travel to broaden her horizons, traveling through Jiangsu and Zhejiang for two years. In the winter of Yihai, she rented a residence in Huzhou and performed for the local officials. Listeners were captivated, and the gold and jade in her hair were soon coveted by bandits. In November, she rented a boat to Shanghai and anchored near Wucheng County at night. At the third watch, whistles sounded everywhere. Everyone looked at each other in panic, and then a group of bandits stood at the bow of the boat with their blades drawn. Lizhen was afraid and wanted to throw herself into the river, but a bandit holding her in the dialect of Huzhou saved her from death. However, in an instant, the boat was looted, and they passed on to other boats, taking goods worth about 1,500 yuan. The next morning, she reported to the local security and planned to report to the county for investigation. A certain gentleman in the town, who was on good terms with Lizhen, quickly came to comfort her upon hearing the news and advised her not to report to the government, believing that these bandits were not real bandits or smugglers. If she reported it, the stolen goods would be difficult to recover, causing only trouble. Lizhen then asked the gentleman if he would be willing to build a fence at a key point to benefit travelers. The gentleman agreed, and Lizhen set sail back to Shanghai. Alas! The savings from years of singing and dancing were used to satiate the greed of bandits. Grief and indignation mixed together, what more could be said? Yet she still wished not to report to the government, and her plan to prevent theft in the future showed that she was a person of great understanding. Lizhen later changed her surname to Jin and her name to Sujuan.</p>
<p>This biography focuses on Lizhen's character, while her artistic achievements are not as detailed as in Shi Pingsou's biography. Rencqiu Jushi commented on her as "often teaching talented people to submit after the song," which is very appropriate. However, she is not "beautiful." Shi Pingsou once joked about it, saying, "I once said to a friend, 'Yang Longyou once said to Li Zhenli, "Beautiful, yes, but chaste, not so much." Is it possible that Yan Lizhen is the same?' My friend said, 'Perhaps chaste, yes, but beautiful, not so much.' I was surprised by his affirmation of her chastity, and he said, 'When her beauty fades, her lack of chastity will seem like chastity.' I said, 'Your words are too harsh.'" The words are indeed harsh, but it is difficult to determine whether Shi Pingsou's words outside of her artistic achievements are truly fair. Being biased to one side or the other is due to subjectivity, which is difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>Regarding Zhixiang, there is already a saying in Yue E's biography. The "Shanghai Book Immortal Flower List of Dingchou" calls her a "heroic character," comparing her to "difficult to crown." The commentary is extremely humorous, saying, "Wind rises beside her ears, fire comes out of her nose," and her actions are clearly not straightforward. Xu Baoyu's affairs are unknown. Only a poem given by Qingxiao student from Baixia was found in the "Shen Bao" at the time, as one of the "Five Storytellers' Poems." The poem says, "Speaking through the dreams of foolish people, they want to wake up, only then do they know that the tongue is clever and the heart is more intelligent. It is not easy to be comical in the world, how can it be less than Liu Jingting in his time?" Presumably, she was quite good at telling "jokes." The Han River guest also has a quatrain praising her: "A new song with a melodious voice. The middle-aged Xu Niang is still romantic. The book building talks about being favored, who knows the body of Biyu back then?" It is a pity that it does not mention her artistic achievements. Wang Xueqing is known for her skill in telling stories in vernacular. Wang Tao once recorded:</p>
<p>Wang Xueqing is good at telling stories in vernacular, with a jade face and a pearl voice, a gentle string and a crisp pipe, truly soul-stirring. At noon and early evening, she often performs in the Luoshen Hall of the Land Temple. Listeners sit side by side, and every word she says is delightful, and wealthy young men compete to please her, all worrying that they will not be able to please her. (5)</p>

<h3>Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, and the Affair with the Romantic Thief</h3>
<p>— (Jade Flute)</p>
<p>Each Hires a Lawyer to Sue Jiang Jianqiu</p>
<p>Mao Jianqiu, the pillar of the female role in the Gong Stage, was recently falsely accused by the romantic thief Jiang Jianqiu, who testified in court that he had been intimate with Mao Jianqiu and that Mao had given Jiang jewelry such as diamond rings and gold bracelets. (See the local news section of the newspaper on the 7th for details) Mao Jianqiu and Jiang Jianqiu sharing the same name, Jianqiu, is quite a coincidence. After this news was published in the newspapers, Mao Jianqiu cried bitterly once. Later, after receiving a letter from Jiang Jianqiu from prison, she laughed heartily once. The crying was because she was falsely accused for no reason, and the laughing was because she thought the matter was so comical that it was unexpected. Now, there are two points that can prove Mao Jianqiu's innocence: First, Jiang Jianqiu testified in court that he had been in a room with Mao Jianqiu at the Da Fang Hotel on March 18, but in the letter he wrote to Mao Jianqiu from prison, there was this sentence: "Recalling when you and I met on April 2 in the French Garden." Comparing the dates, the "room date" was before the "meeting," which is an excellent rebuttal! Second, according to her stage manager, Zhou Jianxing, Mao Jianqiu is always accompanied home by her mother (Mao Yunke's wife) after each performance, and Mao Jianqiu gets up very late every day and would never be able to visit the French Park in the early morning (as Jiang's letter stated). One more point, Mao Jianqiu lives at 61 Gaofu Lane, Sacred Heart Road, Pushi Road, but Jiang's letter mistakenly wrote 41 Gaode Lane.</p>
<p>Since Mao Jianqiu's part of the matter is unreliable, then Yu Guifen and Yao Yuchan, two female performers (both are married, Yu's partner is Wang Yigong, who used to run the Red Star Theater. Yao is the former Yuan Mudan, married to a Zhu, known as Big-Nose Zhu, currently living in Nanjing.), are of course also being falsely accused.</p>
<p>Now, Yu Guifen and Mao Jianqiu, in addition to reporting to the Performing Arts Union, will also hire lawyers to file lawsuits against Jiang Jianqiu for defamation and damage to reputation. Yu Guifen has entrusted Fan Gang Law Firm to handle the case through her husband, Wang Yigong. Mao Jianqiu has hired lawyer Jiang Yiping. The accused side believes that Jiang Jianqiu's false accusations may have been instigated by someone, so legal action is necessary. If the false accusations lead to a heavier sentence, then this romantic thief will truly have brought it upon himself.</p>
<h3>Mao Jianqiu</h3>
<h3>Yu Guifen</h3>
<h3>Song Dezh, a Talented Graduate of the Former Capital Opera School, is Coming to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Master of the Aiping Studio</p>
<p>After the performances of Yan Jupeng and Hou Yulan at the Golden Grand Theater, the theater temporarily switched to showing movies due to the hot weather, which was not suitable for performing Peking opera. It is rumored that Song Dezh has been invited for the next round of opera. Song is a talented graduate of the Former Capital Opera School. After graduating, she formed a troupe (Haoguang Troupe) and performed in the Former Capital. Due to her superior artistic skills, she was enthusiastically welcomed by all walks of life. People in Shanghai have long admired her name and regretted not being able to see her. Now that Song has been hired by the Golden Theater and is about to come to Shanghai to perform on stage, it will surely be a breath of fresh air for opera lovers in this city.</p>
<p>Dezhu was originally a martial arts performer, but due to a lack of talent in the opera school, she also performed roles of the "flower shirt." Her performance style combines the styles of Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, and Xun Huisheng, with Shang's style being the most prominent, followed by Xun's, and then Cheng's. However, it is a strange thing that she studied with Cheng and Xun but had very little contact with Shang.</p>
<p>Since Dezh is skilled in martial arts, her martial arts skills are of course excellent, and her movements are especially called a masterpiece, refined and fiery. Among the current actors, she is considered the best. What a pity is that it is rumored that her soft skills seem to be slightly weaker than Xun Huisheng's, which is a blemish on perfection.</p>
<p>In terms of acting, Dezh's acting is slightly less delicate. Flower Dan operas place great emphasis on acting, often using expressions to convey emotions. Dezh has not studied flower dan operas in depth, which is not a problem. With Dezh's talent and intelligence, if she can practice for a long time and seek delicacy, it will not be difficult.</p>
<p>Dezh's singing used to be less fluent. She was not good at inflection, could not distinguish between strength and softness, and her singing always felt unfamiliar and stiff. This was really due to her practice of martial arts. Recently, she has been diligently tuning her voice in the hope of being able to sing more 工剧 operas. It is hoped that she will become popular in Shanghai. Moreover, Dezh's appearance is beautiful, tall without being gaunt, and thin without being emaciated. She can really be described with the words "romantic charm"!</p>
<p>Before Yu Yushuang came to Shanghai last year, it was rumored that Dezh would come with her. I was happy and excited, but due to other reasons, it did not happen. This time, she is coming to Shanghai to perform as the leading role. Her performance will definitely be excellent. I hope she will make special efforts and not let down the hard work of those who love and support her on the sea!</p>
<h3>Wandering Sentiments of Fellow Artists Soar</h3>
<p>— A Collection</p>
<p>Laurel and Hardy Jest and Tease Each Other</p>
<p>Revealing Smiles Like Maitreya Buddha</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to raise funds for hygiene, invited artists to broadcast on the Sincere Broadcasting Station to broaden publicity. Yesterday, members Yuan Deng, Gu Keming, and Le Pinbao of the association came forward and hosted a reception at the Atlantic Western Restaurant, inviting dozens of people including Chen Gexin, Hong Yiling, Han Lan'gen, Liu Jiqun, Liu Ziyun, Zhang Shiyong, and Li Changjian. There were movie stars, storytelling leaders, comedy masters, and drama pioneers; in short, they were all people who made a living with their mouths. Usually, their solo performances on stage could attract the audience's attention, but on this day, they gathered together, jesting and teasing each other during the meal. Han Lan'gen and Yin Xiucen were known as the Chinese Laurel and Hardy. They sat together on this day, and Zhang Ye'er asked them why their body sizes were so different. Yin said that although Han was small, he had too many "export" locations, so it was no wonder that his income could not cover his expenses, and he was getting smaller and smaller. Han said that Yin was insatiable and could eat three servings of large dishes, not caring about the host's expenses, only knowing how to fill his stomach, so he was getting fatter and fatter. Zhang Ye'er collected the foreign candies from everyone's desserts and gave them to Han Lan'gen, saying that they were British goods called "English" (homophone to "Yin," meaning Yin), and eating them could nourish the body, so he should eat more to avoid becoming as thin as a rib. Zhu Yaoxiang and Hong Jingling did not know each other. After being introduced, Zhu said to Hong: "I have seen your esteemed face on the screen for a long time, so I am very familiar with it. I have admired you for a long time, and I am fortunate to see your true face today." Hong said to Zhu: "I often hear your esteemed voice on the radio, clear and pleasant, and I am also very familiar with it. Today I am fortunate to hear your grand discourse in person, which is even more pleasant than in the air. I am extremely happy." Yu said, "You two gentlemen have never met before, one has seen the image, and the other has only heard the voice, but both have admired each other's great names for a long time. It can be called 'the sound and appearance are still there.'" Everyone laughed. He Shuangdai has recently invented light bulbs and is trying to promote them. Han Lan'gen said that he is currently filming a "Landlord" movie. Yu then said, "Landlord holds a light bulb and speaks to the three tenants, you, if you give me a dozen, then I will tell the three tenants, 'Shuangdai light bulbs use the least electricity,' otherwise, I will tell them 'Shuangdai light bulbs use a lot of electricity.' One word makes a huge difference in praise and disparagement." Everyone admired his ability to "extort money." There were many jokes during the meal, but due to space limitations, they cannot be described in detail. In short, during these two hours, dozens of people were all very happy, and everyone's face was like that of Maitreya Buddha. If it were captured on film, it would be a complete comedy.</p>
<h3>The Old Site of the Summer Peacock to be Rebuilt as a New Type of Cinema</h3>
<p>— New Shadow</p>
<p>In the history of Shanghai cinema, the Summer Peacock Grand Theater at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road can be considered very old. It is said to be the first to show sound films. But for some unknown reason, after sound films became popular, the theater's business became increasingly sluggish under the competition of its peers, eventually declining and shutting down for seven or eight years.</p>
<p>After "August 13th," countless refugees poured into the concessions, and all the empty houses were occupied. The Summer Peacock Grand Theater was also used as a shelter. Until recently, the refugees were moved out, and the entire building is undergoing major renovations, even the facade above the entrance has been removed. After the theater is renovated, it will regain its glory and reopen. However, whether the name will be changed is still uncertain. Perhaps because after the "Isolated Island" experienced crowding problems, entertainment became a big moneymaker, and many new cinemas emerged. Therefore, the Summer Peacock, which had been closed for many years, is now back in the news, and making a profit is certainly a sure thing.</p>
<p>Another report, the Summer Peacock Grand Theater is now being rebuilt by the Far East Company, planning to build a new type of cinema, screening first-run Western films, with seating for 1,200 people. According to the foreign architect in charge of building the theater, the new theater will strive for modernization, paying special attention to the design of the seats to ensure that the audience is comfortable and satisfied, and it is expected to be completed in mid-October.</p>
<h3>Integrating Summer Cooling and Entertainment: Cangzhou Sets Up an Open-Air Cinema</h3>
<p>— Pepe</p>
<p>Open-air cinemas have a long history in Shanghai. The former Dahua and Garden have become relics. The original site of the Dahua Hotel is now a flat land, and the original site of the Garden has been converted into a children's park by the Public Works Department. The only surviving one is the Cangzhou Open-Air Cinema. The lush green grass and the spacious site have left a deep impression on the minds of old Shanghai residents. This time, it has been reorganized and rebuilt into the most ideal summer cooling resort in the sweltering surroundings. The selected films are produced by the American 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Paramount companies. It is said that the selection of films is very strict, and they are all super-special or excellent works. In the residential area of West Shanghai, an open-air cinema that suits the season is indeed very urgently needed, and the person in charge of operating this venue also has a keen eye. It officially opened yesterday, and there were many visitors. Everyone believes that enjoying the cool and watching movies is a win-win situation, and it is a good place to spend a summer night. Two shows are screened every night; at 7:30 PM and 9:30 PM, and the seat prices are very affordable, only three or four dimes.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Sketches of the Art World</h3>
<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>(8) Kunqu Opera</p>
<p>Zhu Yizun's "Jingzhiju Poetry Talk" says: "Liang Chenyu, Zi Bolong, from Kunshan, was skilled in lyrics and songs. At that time, Wei Liangfu, a local, had a beautiful voice. Bolong entrusted him with 'Washing Silk'." This is the origin of the Kunqu Opera style.</p>
<p>This thing once swept through the ranks, and the literati and officials competed for it. In recent years, the fashion of singing national styles has changed greatly. Local operas such as Yue opera, with their crude lyrics, have become popular; this style, however, has become old-fashioned and has been abandoned by the people of the time. The elegant and refined cannot compete with the vulgar and popular for money. This has been the case since ancient times, not just today!</p>
<h3>The Art of Ice Skating (72)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen</p>
<p>Four-Sides Backward: Use the outside of the shoe to move backward, the body should lean back, not forward, the guest leg pushes forward, gradually moves to the back, the guest shoulder turns with it, and the line of sight follows the direction of movement. The most difficult and most important thing in outward retreat is that the start should be from a standing position, after the guest leg pushes, the leaving the ground should be gentle and not rushed, and it is strictly forbidden to form a hook shape behind the main foot, it is best to stand facing the circle you are about to complete, the center of gravity is on the guest foot, that is, the foot you want to push, the right foot moves forward, leaving six to eight inches, the toes point outward, the guest leg is greatly bent, the guest foot uses force to push on the inside, but it should not be rushed, it should follow the main foot. The longer the better.</p>
<p>When about one-third of the entire circle has passed, the shoulder begins to rotate, the guest shoulder is outside the circle, this kind of body rotation accounts for about half of the entire circle, the guest shoulder, arm, leg, and hip rotate with the head at the same time, until the whole body rotates to the position of the next idle step. Then, before the guest foot finishes pushing on the inside, it gradually rotates with the body, half pushing and half dragging behind the main foot, which can not only make the posture of the guest foot when leaving the ground elegant, but also make the side gain strength.</p>
<p>This kind of outward retreat starting method is difficult to learn, but once learned, it is fast and powerful, and can be relied upon. (The outward retreat circle is the fastest step for experts)</p>
<p>Second Step Starting Method: Before the end of a circle, the legs, arms, and head all rotate according to the method of movement. When the first circle is about to end, the swing back of the guest leg and guest shoulder can temporarily shift the weight of the whole body to the inner edge, while the main leg is straightened. This momentary position is exactly the same as the position at the beginning of the first circle. The end of the first step and the beginning of the second step are not interrupted, and the starting methods of the two steps are the same.</p>
<p>Another Starting Method: First place the main foot behind the guest foot, with the toes touching the ground, and then lift the main foot and move it forward. In this way, a lot of force can be borrowed, and it is easier to start. This method is often used by experts. However, when the main foot swings forward, the guest foot must not move an inch, otherwise it is a foul. The common problem for beginners in learning this step is that when the main foot is raised, it often pushes on the ground, causing the guest foot to move, thus violating the rule that the starting of the distant step must be from a standing position, so beginners should still learn the first method.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the guest foot pushes and the body rotates, the direction of the eyes must first be aligned with the center of the circle, the longer the better, and then the head and guest half of the body should be rotated to the center of the venue. When the second step is about to start again, look at the center of the second circle again. This not only prevents loss of shape, but also makes it easy to pay attention to the direction of movement and avoid colliding with others. The above are the first and second styles of body position.</p>
<p>Although the third and fourth styles are used in advanced skating, it is also advisable to practice them at the same time. Use the third style after starting, the upper part of the body is opposite to the first style, because the guest leg stays in front, the guest shoulder and arm move back, advanced skating is often used in (A) before the backward loop knot, (B) after the outward progress reverse swing turn, and (C) before the outward retreat three-character turn.</p>
<p>The fourth style is the opposite of the second style above the waist, because the guest shoulder and arm are in front, and the guest leg is in the back. Advanced skating such as (A) before the outward retreat reverse swing turn. (B) before the outward retreat reverse three-character turn are all used. The above four styles of body position must all be practiced with the entire circle at the same time until learned.</p>
<h3>Midnight Drama Society Postpones Performance</h3>

<h3>Summer Greetings</h3>
<p>— Wan Yu</p>
<p>The semester ended in a torrent of plum rains that lasted for many days, and now, a long summer vacation of nearly two months will begin from this moment. For the past half year, your own academic performance and whether your parents are satisfied with your efforts in learning will be revealed in the report cards issued by the school. There is no way to avoid or conceal it.</p>
<p>Therefore, although it is now the holidays, in order to continue the spirit of past studies, or to remedy the defects that you have previously incurred in your studies, you cannot, and should not, squander the precious time during the two-month holiday. Of course, there is no need to quote the ancients' saying, "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time," to lecture you, but in fact, while you are still in the era of children who are striving for education, you must value time. Isn't it true? Although there is a tomorrow coming after today, the days seem to be endless; therefore, the idiom "the future is long" is not known to have harmed or delayed the studies and futures of many people! You must know that waiting for tomorrow is easy, but is it also easy to turn around and grab yesterday? It's very difficult, right? No, thinking carefully, it may make you afraid, scared, and even alert you to be more aware. Isn't it? The yesterday that cannot be grabbed back is the symbol of burying your childhood; while the tomorrow in anticipation is the ladder to welcome your old age. The passage of time is so rapid, the giant wheel of days is eternally advancing unnoticed by people. If you do not value time, and treat today with a diligent attitude, use today, grasp today, and cope with today; then the arrival of tomorrow will throw today into the ranks of yesterday, and in this conversion, you have suffered an incalculable loss.</p>
<p>As such, the purpose of school vacations is to give you an opportunity to rest, but you must not think that way. Two months, 1,440 hours, are you really going to spend it all in rest? No! You can't! If you are called an excellent student in school, and all your studies are outstanding, then you should take advantage of this holiday to work harder and accelerate your in-depth study, so that when the autumn semester starts, you will find that all your homework is easier to apply and easier to deal with than in the past. Otherwise, even if you are a poor student, it is not impossible to use this holiday to engage in tutoring and exploration, which can also help with your studies in the next semester. After all, humans are rational animals, and I think you certainly don't want to always fall behind others, so you must make extra preparations for your future academic prospects during this holiday.</p>
<p>Having said that, you must also pay attention to your physical health. The meaning of this is that during this vacation, I hope that you will take a few hours each day at an appropriate time to devote yourself to your studies, and then use the remaining time to cool off and rest, so that you can also recuperate your body and mind.</p>
<h3>Don't Let the Summer Vacation Pass By in Playing!</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Children, since July 3rd, all schools have started their summer vacations according to regulations. Aren't we going to have that summer life again? In this two-month holiday, if you don't have a thorough summer plan and let those very precious moments slip away casually, it would be a real pity. The schools probably have "holiday assignments" issued to you, right? We must do these "assignments" diligently, and what needs special attention is that everyone must formulate a plan for how to spend the summer vacation, and don't waste time playing and having fun.</p>
<p>Some children think that it is not advisable to use too much brainpower in the hot weather of ninety-odd degrees. They also regard this long summer vacation as a time for rest. Therefore, they pay no attention to the topics of the various "holiday assignments" distributed to them by the school. Anyway, there is no teacher around to supervise you, so many children only know how to play all day and all night.</p>
<p>Some children, in the first day or two of the summer vacation, seem very happy about the topics given to them by the teacher. So they write large characters in the morning and large characters in the evening, and a copybook is finished in a day or two. But after the vacation has been going on for a while, they all show an unhappy attitude towards all subjects. Needless to say, the grades "rushed" out in this way will not be good.</p>
<p>In fact, both of these attitudes are undesirable! We should not only know how to play, nor should we do things "carelessly" in a rush. During the summer vacation, we should all set a plan for further study in our minds. For example, get up early in the morning, do morning exercises, write large and small characters, read books, and then go out to play for a while... Some children may be dissatisfied with a certain subject in which their grades are poor, then the summer vacation gives you the best opportunity to make up for it.</p>
<p>In short, dear children, you must make good use of these two long months of summer vacation, and don't let the whole summer vacation pass by in playing!</p>
<h3>Summer School in the Family</h3>
<p>— Xixi</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter day by day, and Lian'er's school has started the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Before the vacation, Lian'er's older brother thought that during this long holiday, his naughty younger brother would spend the whole day eating and playing, wasting these precious times. It would be a pity. Therefore, he designed a very complete tutoring plan for his younger brother, and his younger brother happily agreed. But after the summer vacation had started for several days, Lian'er had already put the matter of reading and writing out of his mind.</p>
<p>His older brother repeatedly urged him, but he just smiled foolishly. His older sister even took a book and asked him to read, repeatedly persuading him: "If you study, you will have food to eat in the future, otherwise, you will become a beggar." But his stubborn temper was not effective no matter what words were used to persuade or deceive him. Sometimes his older brother would beat him, and he would also resist. If he lost, he would cry loudly, causing his mother to intervene. Because he was young, he eventually won and continued to play with his toys. They couldn't think of an effective way to make him study.</p>
<p>One day, Lian'er's school sent his report card. His grades were average, but he still passed. Attached was a brochure for summer school. Because his brother knew of his stubborn temper, he said to him in a tone that was soft but firm: "Your grades are not very good, and you are still unwilling to study hard during the summer vacation. Your school is holding summer school. I think you are unwilling to study at home, so you should go to summer school. Which method do you like?" As soon as Lian'er heard that he had to go to school, he felt a headache. He quickly said: "Okay, I don't want to go to school for tutoring, I'll review at home." "That's fine, but you must follow the regulations we set. Otherwise, I'll ask Dad to send you to summer school."</p>
<p>So the five siblings (Lian'er was the youngest) all complied with the regulations they had jointly established.</p>
<p>(1) This school is named "Family Summer School."</p>
<p>(2) This school invites Dad as the principal and Mom as the vice-principal.</p>
<p>(3) This school adopts a joint supervision system.</p>
<p>(4) This school's class time: 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM every day, with no holidays except Sundays.</p>
<p>(5) This school's curriculum is determined by each person, but Lian'er must study Chinese, English, arithmetic, and general knowledge, and must submit one large and one small calligraphy paper every day. Chinese and arithmetic are taught by Ying'er (Lian'er's older brother), and English and general knowledge are taught by Ning'er (Lian'er's older sister).</p>
<p>(6) This school's term is from today until the day before each person's school starts.</p>
<p>(7) This school does not charge any fees and does not recruit new students.</p>
<p>(8) Students of this school who are playful and do not study will be punished by being suspended from eating lunch once.</p>
<p>(9) Students of this school are also directors of the school. If these regulations need to be amended, they will be amended by a resolution of the board of directors meeting.</p>
<h3>Summer Cooling Society is a Summer Paradise</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlü</p>
<p>Now it is the scorching summer again, and the schools have already started their holidays. How are you going to spend this long holiday?</p>
<p>In this hot summer, children who are used to group life must feel the boredom and boredom of holiday life. Although there are parents to guide them at home and brothers and sisters to accompany them, it is never as happy and interesting as school life.</p>

<h3>Several Things to Pay Attention to During the Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>— Gao Ge</p>
<p>Time passes so easily, and it's the summer vacation again. Children, the two-month long summer vacation is when your teachers give you some summer homework, or your loving parents teach you to do some beneficial things during the summer vacation. Regarding how to use the summer vacation, I believe you all have good plans, so I won't mention this point again.</p>
<p>Children! There are several things that you are most likely to violate during the summer vacation. I will write them down now to serve as a warning to you.</p>
<p>Go to public places less! Summer is the season when mosquitoes and flies come out to carry out their activities on a large scale. They are the medium for spreading diseases and can bring germs to us. Especially in this hot summer, it is the best opportunity for them to spread. Therefore, people in general get terrible diseases in the summer. If we go to public places in the summer, others' terrible diseases will immediately be transmitted to us, which is very dangerous. Therefore, I advise all of you children to go to public places less during the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Eat less cold food: Summer is simply a world of cold food, ice cream, shaved ice, sour plum soup... etc. are all available. Many of them are of course well disinfected, but many can be said to be very unhygienic. Children! Aren't you often too hot and eat cheap cold drinks regardless of everything? Children! This is absolutely not allowed. Not long ago, didn't the newspaper report that a child died from eating an unclean popsicle? Children! Think about it, this is such a dangerous thing!</p>
<p>Should get vaccinated: We Chinese have a bad habit, which is that we are unwilling to get vaccinated. On the road, we often see a group of people running away in a panic because they are afraid of getting vaccinated. When they see the people who are vaccinating coming, it is as if they are going to be beheaded. This kind of despicable habit will really be laughed at by foreigners.</p>
<p>Dear children! You are all educated people, so I believe you don't have this habit. We should not only be caught by the people who are vaccinating us to be vaccinated, but we should also take the initiative to get vaccinated. This is not a child's play, but a practical disease prevention work!</p>
<p>Children! I believe that some of you have already implemented the above three things, and I think that some of you have not. Those who have implemented them should not forget to continue to implement them, and those who have not implemented them should quickly go and implement them!</p>
<h3>Guess the Word from the Picture</h3>
<p>— Yu Guobao</p>
<p>Children! It's been a long time since we met, I miss you very much. Has your school started its summer vacation? What do you play with at home? Games, lonely? I have a game for you to play now. Look at the four pictures I have tried to draw below. Please look at the things inside and the way they are placed, and then guess what word they form? I believe that if you use your brain a little, you will be able to guess it. On one hand, you can pass the time during your summer vacation, and on the other hand, you can help you remember how to write this word, so that you will never forget it!</p>
<p>Answers: Catching, Seedling, Fishing, Grief</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony</h3>
<p>— Old Du</p>
<p>As he watched her earnest face gradually relax. This young brother allowed her some space, and she sat beside him, a bouquet of flowers resting on her lap.</p>
<p>I couldn't tear my gaze away from her sweet and pitiful face, noticing her gently whispering in his ear, and he lowered his head, memorizing each word carefully. Finally, she asked him if he remembered the phrases now, and he nodded, indicating that he had memorized them.</p>
<p>According to the program, a young man finished speaking. As the music played again, the brother was even more surprised to see her walk onto the stage, passing through the group of school board members, professors, and distinguished guests, and approaching the principal.</p>
<p>"Sir!" she said, bowing. "Could you please give my brother another chance, because he has now memorized it."</p>
<p>The principal stared at her for a while through his gold-rimmed glasses. Finally, he smiled and granted her request, and then the unsuccessful brother continued his speech.</p>
<p>The music played for a while and then stopped, with a brief announcement of Mr. ××, his topic being "Historical Contrasts."</p>
<p>The audience's expectations were realized. They sat quietly, also worried for the speaker who was nervous on stage. But fear not! The young hero had awakened! He overcame everything, achieved his determined goal, and wiped away his shame. A smile appeared on the tear-stained child's face. I closely observed the face that was giving the speech—the large eyes, parted lips, concentrating all his attention on his words, forgetting the listening audience, and his spirit was moved along with him.</p>
<p>The speech was over, and he fearlessly gained enthusiastic sympathy, breaking the wrong judgments. The noble audience madly praised him, and flowers were thrown up like a storm. She helped her brother wipe away his shame—that beautiful face, filled with high and joyful colors, this matter was permanently engraved in her heart.</p>
<h3>In the Realm of Beasts (8)</h3>
<p>— Qingxin</p>
<p>Peng Qi looked around for a while and began to feel uneasy. He hurriedly opened his mouth and asked, "Where is the person in the moon!" The chattering titmouse rushed to answer, "He has gone somewhere else."</p>
<p>The crow asked, "Do you have anything to say against it? Caw, caw, caw, if you have the guts, dare to pluck my feathers?"</p>
<p>Peng Qi did not answer the crow's challenges, but thought to himself, "These things are very strange, never mind, I'll go ahead and take a look."</p>
<p>The black dog barked a few times, but still let him pass; the bee was still buzzing and flying non-stop, and the cat in the cradle was still swaying and sleeping sweetly.</p>
<p>Peng Qi thought to himself again, "If I could ride a horse forward, that would be faster than walking myself." Then he went to the grazing mare and asked if it could take him a few miles.</p>
<p>The mare coldly said, "Are you crazy? You should be taking me for a walk, how can you ask me to take you for a walk?" As she spoke, her nose seemed to grow longer and longer, and terrifying light seemed to shoot out of her eyes. Peng Qi was stunned, frightened, almost breathless; he quickly ran away as fast as he could, and he unknowingly went deeper into the realm of beasts.</p>
<p>Ah, this is truly a most beautiful place. The beasts here, in all shapes and forms, are even more numerous than in the zoo; and they are all free. They do not kill each other, nor do they have the behavior of the strong preying on the weak, because in the realm of beasts, there grows a very special kind of short grass everywhere, which everyone can eat and everyone can fill their bellies with.</p>
<p>They get along well with each other on a daily basis, and if there are any quarrels or immoral behaviors, the person in the moon would loudly shout, "Keep the rules! Keep the rules!" And everything would immediately quiet down, not even a sound.</p>
<p>All the beasts in this realm of beasts must not only keep the rules, but also have considerable politeness. As Peng Qi walked along, they came in groups to welcome him, each in its own way. The cats rubbed their legs against their heads, straightened their tails, like soldiers raising their guns. The dogs wagged their tails and barked softly, circling around him; only a French poodle sat still throughout, seemingly expressing its elegance and politeness. The little crows were happily chirping or singing songs. The pigeons sat on his shoulders, making cooing sounds. Two swallows clung to the brim of his hat, twitching their tails, murmuring as if to greet him. A peacock walked in front of him, specially spreading its beautiful long tail; and a group of rose-colored parrots also gathered behind to show their welcome. After a while, a solemn and intelligent old elephant came to Peng Qi and knelt down, Peng Qi happily climbed onto its back, and it carried him forward, with the rest of the beasts following behind.</p>

<h3>Further Record of the Dragon in Nanhui</h3>
<p>The dragon that passed over Nanhui City was more than fifty feet long, with its thickest part resembling a household water storage vat. It was as white as a bolt of silk, and its entire body was visible, with no cloud accompanying it. However, its body was enveloped in a hazy white mist, like a naked person clothed in gauze, making it impossible to see the scales clearly. Yet, the sunlight shining upon it made it appear as white as silver, which was indeed the dragon's scales. Its head was wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, as large as a seven-stone vat. Because of the encircling white mist, its horns were not visible, but roughly its shape resembled the head of a cow or horse. Its four feet were all on the front half of its body, very close together, quite different from the depictions by worldly painters. Its four feet were each more than three feet long. The claws were blurred and indistinguishable. The neck and head were both slightly thin, while the abdomen was particularly thick. The neck was estimated to be ten feet long, the abdomen twenty feet, and the tail more than thirty feet. The four feet were located at the thick part of the neck and below the abdomen, so it is known that everything beyond the hind feet belonged to the dragon's tail, and the tail was the longest part. Its tail resembled an eel, round and wide when viewed head-on, and thin and pointed when viewed from the side, sometimes pointed and sometimes round, without a fixed shape. Snakes move in curves, one left and one right; but dragons move in curves, one up and one down. The dragon-spine walls in Shanghai are also round, which can be said to be very similar. When the dragon was lowest outside the city, its tail hung down, about ten feet from the ground. Entering the city, its tail was level and did not hang down, about forty to fifty feet from the ground. Leaving the city, it lowered again to about ten feet. When it first left the city, its movement was still slow, but suddenly a patch of dark clouds came flying from the southeast. The dragon obtained these clouds, and its movement became faster. The further away it got, the higher it went, and in an instant, its tail was suspended in the clouds to the southeast. At this time, the clouds to the southeast formed a dragon frame, suspending five dragon tails, which then merged into six, all dark black in color. Only then did people realize that the previous whiteness was due to sunlight shining on it, appearing white up close and black from afar. No people or animals were harmed, but several roof tiles and one thatched roof outside the north gate were torn off. One corner of a house and one large tree inside the city were damaged. Several thatched roofs were damaged outside the east gate. A total of twenty or thirty roofs were damaged. When the objects were torn off, people only saw them flying up, but did not see where they landed.</p>
