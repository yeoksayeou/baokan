<h3 id="c10">中蘇密約說 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>在心理為摹倣，在病理為傳染，於是輒有因時而忽盛行者焉；若近頃歐洲國際，縱橫椑闔。鈎心鬭角，各取所需而結為同盟，訂立協定，盛行一時，方興未艾：餘風所被，或竟謂遠東亦復爾爾。如昨日報載路透社東京電，謂有二報，刊布中國與蘇聯締結密的；我人殊未信中蘇如此傳染，殆無聊之徒，摹倣時尙而投機聳聽而已。甲報謂蘇聯對華，供給飛機駕駛員與機匠，無限量；又供給借欵四萬萬圓，備中國購置軍火所需，以五千萬圓聯合設文中蘇軍火進口公司。乙報謂蘇聯援華抗日，要索代價：事由孫科氏在莫斯科談判，其旣獲蔣委員長核准者，有下列諸點：其一，中國必先商諸莫斯科、始得接受任何第三國之調停；二。中國應將國民政府內及其他管轄區中之主和派，予以絕對取締；其三，中國對於中央軍與共產軍以及各省軍，其配備與待遇，必須一律；其四，劃陝甘新疆三省為行政特別區，以毛澤東為主席，純由共產軍駐守，蘇聯得開發三省富源，並派駐軍官一員為軍事代表；其五、中國應聘蘇聯專家，為軍事訓練官，訓練士兵與飛行員；其六，西安莫斯科間，經由蘭州哈密迪化，闢陸空路綫；而蘇聯則於物質上技術上，無限制的援助中國，為交換條件云。</p>
<p>如此電傳，我人為時間所限，當不及聞悉中蘇兩國當局若何表示；其或為是認，為吾認，為保持緘默，皆在不可知之數。姑就所傳而分析之，則無一而不與眞情實理相刺謬；兩國當局對此，殆將以其百無一是而無可是認，更以其幼稚可哂而視為不値吾認歟。蓋以我人所知所信：自中國發動全面抗戰以來，除侵略國之儔，無不予中國以同情與援助，初非蘇聯一國。蘇聯自物質上技術上儘量援華，由來已久，初不自今始；基於道義，基於互信；故無條件，亦無密的。蘇聯豐於軍火產額而絀於金條銀塊，中國期待蘇聯者亦在彼而不在此，故始終未聞議及所謂借欵；况政府與政府間之直接授受，更何待撥欵設公司。兩國航空綫，闢於重慶與莫斯科之間。早經公開試航，何必要索之為密的條件。凡此數端，在事實，在精神，以及其包涵之性質，皆視束報傳稱者為高；彌可珍重。允東報所不克衡量，不能理解者也。餘如所謂聘請專家，中國歷來邀的客卿、為數夥矣，顧乃當局自主之行動，豈以國際條的之拘束；中國為抵抗侵略而戰，亦為爭取自由而戰，豈甘以聘請專家之自由，喪諸所謂密的。又如謂劃三省為特區，何人主政，何軍駐守，何國專利；此乃侵略者之欲求，擬諸蘇聯則不稱；柬報若此口吻，謂非仁者見仁。智者見智，謂非淵源有自者歟。又如所謂各軍配備與待遇之一律，前嘗由中國軍事當局斥為挑撥離問之辭；蓋待遇一律，行之已非朝夕，而配備不齊則為事實所限；且抗戰以來，隊伍以方面分，非有所謂中央與共產之分；配備隨事實所容許而逐漸充實改進，允無與於方面。凡此數端。不但反證之以事實，可以斷言其不然，亦得以情理推知中蘇兩方決不以此為密的條件也。至於非先商承莫斯科，不得接受他國調停，以及絕對取締主和派云云，此乃變節分子之語調，其辭若有憾於蘇聯，實謀所以誣中國政府為赤化；摹倣傳染，彼此交織，於是取為擬議密的之資料矣。</p>
<p>國際旣有矛盾，即有利害；旣有利害，即有友敵；旣有友敵，或交惡交戰，或結同盟，或訂協定，或締密的；各視所需，各取所宜，固慣用之辦法，亦慣見之方式，原不足該　者也。况此所謂八法與方式者，雖必有其後果，然就大體言志，謂為條約產生時勢，毋寗謂為時勢產生條約；如英法同盟，乃英法結合之產物，非以同盟使英法結合；如德義同盟，乃德義結合之產物，非以同盟使德義結合；蘇聯與英法，日本與德義，旣有非不同之道，亦有其可合之音，今之若即若離，豈條約為之　哉。由此推之，中蘇締盟，初非絕不可能；而英法保障波瀾羅馬尼亞之後，蘇聯在西方所感受之威脅稍馳，則在東方更趨積極之理由愈多，亦即中蘇之共成威安定遠東志主力者，其條件亦愈備、是以中蘇兩國或範圍不止兩國，若再最近將來，採取合理之辦法，由何重要表見，有何發展，皆屬不足該異之現象；顧仍必以相互為方式，以平等自由為原則，決非若東報所傅之密約，是可斷言耳。</p>

<p>自蕪湖無錫等處、禁阻運米出境後、一般囤戶、乘此靑黃不接之際、企圖壟斷、以致市塲混亂、暗盤交易復熾、經米業團體緊急處置後、昨日市塲人心漸安、價格回跌趨穩、米業靜候租界當局速籌妥善辦法、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>囤戶壟斷市塲混亂</p>
<p>豆米業市塲管理委員會切實執行限價、取締非法暗盤交易之後、市塲價格、始吿穩定、暗盤交易絕跡、近因蕪湖·無錫·等處、禁阻運米出境、於是一般囤戶、乘機壟斷、企圖厚利、市塲上形勢緊張、暗盤交易復熾、頭號白米巳逾十六元、中决各米、或逾限價、或並頂盤、情形混亂、事態嚴重、而各米號門市零沽頭號白米、已漲至十六元二角、二號亦已逾十五元限價、長此以往、與整個滬市民食、影響甚鉅、</p>
<p>規定賞金奬勵舉發</p>
<p>各米業團體如豆米行業·米號業。等、於前晚曾一度非正式之會議、對於市塲之暗盤交易、決予嚴格取締、並切實執行限價、以維滬市民食、除再佈吿嚴勵執行處罰　、並望任伺人　時舉發吿密、苟無物證、而確有事實人證、一經查朋、決予處罰、並規定舉發者、得賞金三成、例如查獲確實、則買賣及中間人各罰一百元、則賞金共為三十元、旨在獎勵仟何人之舉發吿密、</p>
<p>責令管委嚴密糾察</p>
<p>豆米行業公會巳責令市塲管理委員會全體委員符前耕·王天仇·顧益生·等十九人、嚴密糾察市塲上之不正當交易、切實執行限價、依法嚴予處罰、又新聲社記者昨晨赴市塲視察、混亂情形、較前日稍佳、人心漸安、價恪回跌、但依照限價成交數目、總僅五千餘包、至於暗盤交易、依然如故、惟交易者均鬼鬼祟祟因深恐為人舉發、而受市塲管理委員之處罰、</p>
<p>七次存米調查已竣</p>
<p>滬市兩租界存米、　米業評價委員會五月六日第六次調查報吿、為五十六萬七千一百三十八包、至於第七次存米調查、業已於昨日完竣、開始整理、準今日正式發表、聞其總數為五十六萬三千餘包、較上週減少約三千餘　包、至於連日由產地運滬之米、十三日共約二千包、十四日共約二千五百包、際此青黃不接之時、到米之稀少、為每年必有之現象、惟米價之飛漲、實為一般意料之外、</p>
<p>靜候當局妥籌辦法</p>

<p>— —譯Sunday　Mercury—</p>
<p>本埠外僑之大多數不信歐洲大戰、迫在眉睫、至少有法人一、覺戰爭遲早必成事實、意人一、以為戰事大的將發生之成分、較不致發生之成分為多、惟德人一、相信各問題終可覓得和平之解決、其不信戰事行將到臨之數人、皆以為希望或可成思想之母、但美人團體敢決美國將不參戰、記者因歐洲危機日見緊急、曾就與歐局最有關係的數國之僑民、探詢彼等之意見、茲彙錄如决、想為關心時局者所樂聞也、</p>
<p>德願與法和平相處</p>
<p>德律師威廉博士曰、余不信戰事即在目前、德國有心向和平之元首在、決不欲訴諸武力、余近會遨遊歐洲、覺各國中唯德國不談戰事、其他各國人民皆謂德國不鑒及各國報章之輿論、其作此言、實極愚昧、要知德國並不如是、德國恒願與其鄰邦生存於和平之中、元首希特勒最近猶特殊聲明、德國願與法國和平相處、德國不因英國報紙盛談戰事而震動、德國不欲得英國任何屬地、余意波蘭問題有獲和平解決之可能、余信波蘭等國必可諒解、若德國該部分為他國之走廊分開、而不予德國以交通之便利、此實不近情理、元首在某决演說中、曾稱本年九月間之國社黨大會、將名之曰「和平大會」、此節甚堪注意也、</p>
<p>意國情勢今非昔比</p>
<p>中意航業公司意人里希尼曰、歐洲戰禍能望挽回之機會有二、（一）所謂民治陣綫與軸心國相融洽、（二）該陣綫勢力雄厚、足以嚇倒柏林羅馬、然後者恐難成事實、德意將為彼等之權利而奮鬥、意國猶未忘上决歐洲大戰後議和時為英法所紿、英法囊括所有、而意國則毫無所獲、飢者將不擇食、必爭而得之、今有一事可決者、德意對其今所有者、將永不心饜、意國民衆現日受宜傳之打針、使知意國國力强厚、當局絕少談及金錢之無多、亦未注重新時代之戰爭、經濟重於武器一節、今日之情勢、當然遠不若一九三五年之惡劣、當時英艦隊駛入地中海、以對付意艦隊、意艦隊之軍火、祇敷作六小時之戰鬥今則意國海陸軍皆軍火充足矣、</p>
<p>日人感想注視英國</p>
<p>同盟社日記者Shibata曰、余意歐洲戰爭實現與消滅之機會、各佔其半、英國對於戰事、諸多顧忌、其一為歐戰旣作、日本將乘機攘奪遠東英人之利益、再、英國因欲維持均勢與現局、及欲決定德義日反共同盟究將有你結果、以便發言、故至少目前不致發動、總之、英國現守觀望態度、其大部分之注意、無疑的將在由英為調解人、而成中日和局之可能性、蓋此舉可置日本於大舉參加歐戰之不利地位、英國相信如是則彼能進行建立民治陣綫矣、大局今極微妙、孰敢決定歐戰即將發生、或不發生乎、蓋任何事件均能牽動均勢也、</p>
<p>法商觀察戰禍不免</p>
<p>經營世界貿易巴黎某商行之入口經理曰、歐戰在余觀之、實不能免、或發生於最近之將來、或發生於距今若干時、或竟發生於明日、但余敢決終必發生、余意一切談判、不特不足療病、且轉將增重之、唯一之希望、厥在民治車綫强於柏林　馬軸心、恐即如是、亦不能消弭戰禍也、余之巴黎總行來函云、戰事雖不致立即發生、但不可不作未雨綢繆計、故銷於中國之貨物、立即交貨之定單、法國尙可接受、遠期交貨之定單、則須拒絕、因防戰事發生、港口封鎖、或輪船被沉、貨物披沒收也、自一九一四年夏季以還、歐洲之憂慮戰禍、從無若今日之甚者、蓋上年九月捷克危機發生時、余之商行猶接受遠期定單、甘冒危險、而今日則不敢也、此使由歐洲運貨銷滬之商家大受損害、自中國工廠為砲火轟毀後、入口織品、銷路激增、吾人若能接受遠期定單、則誠大佳事也」、</p>
<p>民治國可消弭歐戰</p>
<p>近游歐洲歸滬之某英籍證券經紀人曰、余意民治各國突然轉强其態度、大足消弭歐戰、歐洲今日火藥、散播各地、星星之火、即易使之燎原、但余意希特勒與墨索里尼今皆需用保安火柴、且擬繼續作此戒防、彼等寗願從事談判、而不預冒昧興戎、以作僥倖之圖、萬一先敗、必將盡失其今日之所有、余意德國旣與羅馬尼亞訂成協定、因此可獲得收回其舊日殖民地所能得之利益、如油小麥等產品、均可隨意得之、且不必付出行經費、及維持海航之費、歐洲之緊張、固非一時所能寬弛、但余信不致發生戰禍也、</p>
<p>墨氏智慧不致求戰</p>
<p>美國海軍靑年會事務秘書羅斯日、余個人之見解、歐洲不致發生戰爭、歐洲之政治家今人人皆知戰爭之意義、允以墨索里尼為最、墨氏至聰明、至愛國、決不忍使意國淪於破壞也、上决歐戰時、余曾服務意國靑年會中頗久、所得經騐甚巨、余深知墨氏之為人、但余對於希特勒所知甚寡、然余意希氏不得墨氏之助、必無能為也、墨氏善用其智慧、雖其仇者亦為欽佩、余信墨氏必知大戰一旦發生、將使之喪失大權、且毀滅其手成之功業、意國之財力、不能從事大戰、意國或有被迫捲入戰爭漩渦之虞、如上决歐戰之奧國然、但余個人不信意國將出此、全信墨氏因熟悉經濟、及愛護本國、必永無簽字於對英法宣戰書之一日、渠必如當日慕尼黑然、另覓一出路也、</p>

<p>大陸報云、日海軍發言人昨日（十三日）招待各報記者時聲稱、公共租界工部局與法租界公董局於星期四日頒佈會銜吿示後、對於日方要求的態度之唯一差異、乃在於兩局各自對「上海市府」之態度、有所不同而巳、法當局就某數種問題、直接與「市府接觸、而工部局對「市府」所致照會、甚至不予答覆、有請發言人詳述其所謂「某數種問題」者、海軍發言人答稱、今尙未有所確定、但均係微小問題、其一與南市之法租界自來水廠有關、發言人對會銜吿示所獲得之任何確切結果、亦不知之、但稱渠切望不久可見良好結果、同時、華日雙方對五月十一日之吿示、在兩租界中禁止華方政治團體者、未有其他批評、</p>

<p>法律言論略談加租問題  兪鍾駱　　過去之上海，市儈者流，以人爲的方法，輾轉抬高地價，影響所及，屋貴如金，呈登峰造極之象。惟好景不常，其反動之烈，則有所謂不景氣之過程，經「二八」而至「八一三」，地價慘落，市况蕭條，空屋櫛比，欠租之訟，前後相接，不動產之業主捉襟見肘；甚至曾以地產大王自豪者，亦以破產逃亡聞。種其因者獲其果；則以不動產之租賃求利得者，宜亦可以鑒往知來而知所戒懼矣。　　迺自國軍西移，上海以畸形的孤島，能容四方流亡，突呈畸形的繁榮。彈丸租界，人口激增，數幾倍於往時全市戶口，於是住屋缺乏，租金騰貴。乘火打刦者，先有所謂二房柬之高價分租，繼之以得利轉頂，久而引起萊主貪饞之念，亦竟相率要求增加其租金。不遂所欲，則以勉求一切合法，或非法之手段，以達終止租賃，另行高價出租之目的。而來自內地，無以蔽風雨者，竟亦不惜輕擲數千金，而求得一棟之屋，以暫栖止；此變本加厲之加租問題，方興未艾，顯予市民生活上以嚴重之威脅。然按之實際，則不動產之交易，亦僅限於向稱偏僻之西區空地，及價額較小之住宅，稍形活潑；繁盛中心之大段地產，與夫輝煌建築，仍屬無人問津，欲出脫之，即非抑低戰前原價不可。現象反常，純然基於戰時難民麕集，一地一時需要供給之特殊原因；固不能視爲租賃物本身正常之昇降。業主經租人或轉租人遭逢時會，意外收穫，不可謂非「非常時期過分利得稅條例」所指「過分利得」之一種。依該條例第五條所示之稅率，應就超過其財產價額之利得額征百分十乃至百分五十之過分利得稅；如能嚴厲執行，或亦足以稍戢加租之風歟？　　近讀最高法院上海特區分庭二十六年度滬上字第七〇號判例，就民法第四四二條所定當事人得聲衣法院增减租金之原因有所闡明曰：所謂不動產價值之昇降，係指租賃物本身價值而言，非因基於需要供給之特殊原因，作爲租賃物本身價値之昇降，以增减其租金。此一判例，嘉惠於承租人，誠有限止出租人濫請加租之相當效力。而事實上因加租不遂，假藉別種原因以求終止租賃，或採用不合法之手段使承租人不能安居，終不得不勉强就範，或忍痛他遷，間接仍以滿足出租人之欲望者；則非前述判例效力所能及，將不得不藉社會輿論誅伐之！　　惟從業主方面言之，其相率要求加租，亦自有其主觀設辭，如市政地捐之普遍增加，向之方單地，及實際上無所使用之空地無捐稅者，今亦不加區別同樣增捐。自來水之消耗量，因租屋內所住之人口加多而激增，應由業主轉付之水費，與里街電燈費亦繼長增高，開支旣較往時爲鉅，自不得不謀所以轉嫁其負擔，一律拒絕，亦非合理。除地捐之增加，與承租人房捐之增加，其數相埒，且同屬市民應盡之義務，應不許互謀轉嫁外。如因業主負担水費，及里衖電燈費，而其支出較往時激增，則就其增益之支出，比例分担，於額定租金外，使各承租人按月附繳於業主，足爲解決租賃關係人間加租糾紛折中至當之辦法，事實上準此辦理者，已不在少。　　時値非常，勵行節的，加租之風，洵非現代社會情况所容許；一時一地需要供給之特殊原因，叉非法所認可之加租原因。賢明之業主，能併識此；當亦不再懂憬於過去屋貴如金登峰造極而不能持久之好景矣。司機者過失傷害與所有人連帶賠償責任  效文　　汽車傷人，司機者莫不被訴過失傷害，而附帶民事訴訟，所有人莫不被訴運帶負食賠償，至司機者是吾眞有過失，被害人之是吾與有過失抑或應完全自負過失之責，在所不問，而所有人對於選仟司機者及監督其職務之執行，是吾已盡相當注意，或縱加以相當之注意，而仍不免發生損害，如民法第一百八十八條第一項但書之規定，應不負連帶責任者，亦所不問也。　　對於汽車傷人事件，如警務當局認定司機者確有重大過失時，固照刑法第二百八十四條第二項：「從事業務之人，因業務上之過失，傷害人者，處一年以下有期徒刑，拘役，或一千元以下罰金。致重傷者，處三年以下有期徒刑，拘役，或二千元以下罰金。」或照刑法第二百七十六條第二項：「從事業務之人因業務上之過失，致人於死者，處五年以下有期徒刑或拘役，得併科三千元以下罰金。」之規定起訴。耶使警務當局認爲司機者並無過失，或認被害人與有過失不提公訴時，而被害人或被害人之家屬提起自訴之時，亦莫不請求法院依照前開之條文，判處罪刑並耍求損害賠償也。　　被害人受傷或因傷致死，固屬一極悲慘之事，然若使被害人自不小心，致受意外傷害，而司機者絕無過失可言時，司法者徒因憐憫被害人之故，無故判處司機者以罪刑，併使所有人負担連帶賠償之責，亦豈事理之平。　　常見有年僅七八齡之幼童，成羣橫串馬路，購買糖菓，及至購得以後，即不問馬路上之交通燈爲綠爲紅，更不顧馬路兩旁或中間，有無車輛來往，常垂頭直衝，橫過車前，致司機者不及煞車，發生意外傷害情事，由事實而論，此時之司機者實無過失可言。縱使認定司機者不無過失之處，而其過失之程度，亦屬微乎其微。至若幼孩碰及卡車邊旁，倒地跌入車下，爲後輪盤所輾傷者，則司機者根本不知有人穿入車下，事前即無所謂應行注意之事，此時如認司機者亦有過失，判處罪刑，其爲寃抑，自不待言。　　曾記前年虹口有一幼孩爲人橫推入車腹下被後輪盤輾傷斃命，初審判處司機者徒刑一年六個月，而上訴結果，認爲司機者此時無法注意，應不負刑責，將原判決撤銷，宣告司機者無罪。斯眞明白過失責任之所在，實爲一極公平之裁判。因司機者過失傷害之處罰，應以司機者實有過失爲前提，吾則如司機者並無過失之處，即使被害人受傷身死，亦與司機者無涉，何况輕微傷害無關重要者乎。　　所有人於車行時乘坐在車內，司機者因過失致人於死傷，認其未盡民法第一百八十八條第一項但書所定之責任，使之負祖速帶賠償之責，猶可說也；如司機者單獨開行於外，而所有人閉門家坐，發生意外事件，仍令所有人負担連帮之責，由情理而論，亦殊失公平之道。　　至於賠償數額多寡之決定，應以過失行爲者之過失程度及其經濟狀况而定，不能因有所有人爲之連帶負責賠償，即判令司機者多賠，更不能因汽車曾經保險，有保險公司爲所有人担負賠償之責，而特令多予賠償，因保險公司之保險汽車，其徵收保費係根據於均數之原則，並非任意收取。不應多賠而多賠，必將害及於均數之原則。結果，直接影響於保險公司本身之生存，而間接影響將及於一般社會之經濟。余非故爲司機者，所有人及保險公司作辯護，實法理人情所應爾也。調解如何可收實效  瞿鉞　　「訟則終凶」，古有明訓。國家爲杜息爭端减少訟果起見，曾於民國二十年一月一日施行民事調解法，旋新民事訴訟法於民國二十四年七月一日施行後，民事調解法廢止。然於民事訴訟法中，如簡易案件；離婚之訴，及夫妻同居之訴，終止收養之訴等，均有於起訴前先行調解之原則，足徵立法者仍未忘乎息訟之旨。　　顧自調解制度實施而後，其效果若何？回憶當民事調解法施行之初，一般觀念，以爲有此調解，或可减少若干訟累。殊不知當强制履行調解程序時期，深感調解之難以成立，在國家有减少法收之虞，在人民有徒耗狀紙之苦，一時訾調解爲無意義，而新民訴法之酌採調解制，而於某種條件之下，如民訴法第四百零九條但書規定者，法許不必調解，此由調解之須雙方同意，而爲此較進步之規定，不可謂非立法者之苦心矣。　　然則調解制爲不可行乎？曰，吾吾—調解制之有裨事實，絕對不能吾認。以兩造紛爭而爲起訴，其根於不明事理者什二三，其激於意氣者什七八，設法院而能爲之調解，微獨上訴之訟累可以减少，雙方之意氣可以抑平，更有一種事實，依法處斷，難得其平，惟調解可以斟酌於情法之間，而歸結於比較公允之途，是調解之利多弊少，不待智者而決已。　　現在各法院試行調解，其收效果何如乎？難收宏效，共故安在？就現社會與現行法，果可改善共調解乎？竊以現在法院推事，熱心諄勸者固有，而奉行故事者，亦未敢謂爲絕無。其弊在同時調解案件太多，致推事未究案中詳情，致僅爲機械式的調解，無怪世人目調解僅推銷訴狀製造檔案而已。欲收實效，　排案不可太多，　有特殊情形之案件，宜不公開，　推事詳究案情，更就理曲者以隔別先訊，並加曉譬，　有希望成立者，宜不憚煩而酌事展期，予以協商之餘地，　有律師代理者，更勸律師各自諄動其當事人。總之尊嚴之法官，苟予以相當之勸告，九鼎一言，究與尋常人之勸告不可同年語，此願法官之拂以熱誠，期收法律上之效果也。　　或者謂；民事本可和解，而必於調解致其全力，法院不但减少收入，其於案件亦將不勝其煩歟？曰；國家法收，原非積極性的，民間减少訟爭實仍爲國家之利。至起訴以後和解，究不若未起訴以前之調解，尙未入於訴訟範圍，而情感之較易恢復也。若夫調解不成立，兩造均已到塲，依法得依一造常事人之聲請，命即爲訴訟之辯論，此種情形，法院頗少實施。實則調解不成立，自應早予審理，速爲終結。聞此因法官辦案關係，然乎否乎？內部問題，誠宜別定辦法以救濟之。談話情與法  宗孟　　近兩年來，政府頒布之特別法令，爲數頗多，所以適應非常時期之特殊環境，以期切合當前實際之需要，於適用之際，一無扞格之病。然揆其性質，以關於刑事特別法令，居其多數；若民事，則寥寥可數焉。　　民刑事法規，因其性質各殊，而適用之範圍亦異，學者嘗謂民法之與人生，猶如布帛菽粟，未可一日或離，良以民法規定人民之權利義務，實爲日常生活之規範，非若刑罰法規必於犯罪之後始有其適用者也。　　在此非常時期之中，本於「洽亂世，用重典」之訓，制定若干刑事特別法令，以補充普通刑法之不備，或加重普通刑法之處罰，要爲事實所必然；然民事法規之重要性，旣較刑罰法令爲允甚，非常時期情勢之推移，環境之變換，亦有若干事例，須設爲特別規定，耍亦事勢所趨，不容忽視！曾憶民國二十七年五月三日，司法行政部，曾以訓字第一○三五號訓令，通令各級法院，辦理民事案件，應注意現行法令有利於債務人各規定，司法者關懷民瘼之德意，固溢於言表，但在司法上顧全債務人之利益，因條文所限，收效不廣，實不若於立法上謀所補救，方可期均沾其惠也。　　在此非常時期之中，以環境特殊，因無特別法令，致事實上陷於困難，甚至生情法不平之感者，更僕難數，姑以閧動一時之慶餘里拆屋一事爲例，可概其餘。　　慶餘里拆屋糾紛，旣經判決確定，吾人不欲多言，惟房客總數，達三千餘人之巨，當此居住問題極度恐慌之今日，執行些三千餘人遷讓出屋，已爲一極棘手之事，巨觀連日各報，房客籲求救濟，房東表明原因，事之楚非，理之曲直，可付諸社會之公評，然房東於履行的定義務而訴求遷讓，法也；房客因無屋可遷而泣求展限，情也。在此種情形之下，全法乎？爲人情所難能，原情乎？於法又無據，吾知當事者內心之苦悶，必較諸葛亮揮淚斬馬謖爲允甚也。　　夫「人非木石，孰能無情」？法固可貴，情亦難捨，必於全法之中，兼獲原情之道，方合忠恕之義，而免偏激之弊。然司法當局，本以運用法律，爲其神聖之職務，若原情之道，爲法所明定者，必不吝運用其職權，以顧全民衆之疾苦，若法律尙乏明文，原情安所準據？此司法者之苦心，當爲人所共諒。惟民事案件，不告不理，即獲確定判決，仍可緩謂執行，是則捨法言情，實有待於當事人本共固有之人類同情心而有以善共後也。若慶餘里之事，拆屋翻造，縱爲事所必行，然延展時日，使免流離之苦，又係情理中應有之義，我知當事者一方，覩茲三千餘人「同灑破家之淚」，亦當有動於中也。　　雖然，於此情形之下，捨法言情，固不得不望之於當事之人，然「法律不外人情」，故窮源究委，仍不能不求法律之合乎人情。考各國立法制度中，有所謂「全民的法律」者，以立法之權，操諸全體人民之手，使國家之法律，即爲人民之公意，實合我國古昔「國人皆曰可殺殺後殺之」之遣意，必如此，始可免情法失平之弊，我國現雖未至憲政之階段，然法律旣欲人民共信守，即不能與民情相背馳，就此非常時期之特殊環境，制定新的法規，不容或緩！况歐美各國於戰時公布民事特別法律，成例具在，且所謂非常時期，五年乎？十年乎？旣無所限止，復無從確定，然非一朝一夕之短時期，則可斷言，苟不作亡羊補牢之計，則情法失平之事，　將有增無已，又將何以善其後耶？裁判輯要　　（最高法院上海特區分庭）　　提起抗吿或再抗吿，須對於受有不利益之裁定，始得爲之。（民二十七年度滬抗字第二五號）　　按推事會參與前審裁判者，係指推事就同一訴訟事件，曾參與下級審裁判而復在上級審參與者而言。至若發回更審案件，在法律上旣無不許在本審級之同一推事復行參與更審之裁判，則亦即無應自行廻避之原因。（民二十七年度滬抗字第二六號）　　法院或審

<p>自由談不必等待  張鎭山　　事業被黷武者的侵略鐵蹄所摧殘的人，飯碗被黷武者的侵略鐵蹄所踏碎的人，真不知道有多少！十九個月來，之聽到事業問題的日益嚴重，事業羣的數字日益增加！尤其是上海。　　不幸而被捲進了事業漩渦的人，其唯一的期望和工作，無疑的就是懇親求友代謀職業，終日徘徊於親友之門，虛聲下氣，把熱面孔去碰冷面孔。　　然而，事實告訴我們，在現在懇親求友代謀職業的結果，十有九是得來幾句：「現在謀事真是苦難，但請勿急，等到最後勝利之後，總有辦法……」的摩登安慰語；似乎等到最後勝利之後，就立刻有事可做，這種「摩登」的碩大，不但是被請求者用以安排失業者的最好方法，即失業者的本身也多以此自慰。　　我們雖不否認，在最後勝利之後謀職業比較現在統一，但是，我們卻不敢贊同一般失業者坐守家園，以待最後勝利。因為將來的建設時期，必然的，是需要有充分的學識，有豐富的技能，有勇敢的精神，有健強的體魄的人才，來建設新中國，決不致會需要一般平平庸庸，空無所有的人物來共同吃飯；還一句話說，就是：沒有學識，技能，體魄的人，等到最後勝利之後，畢竟還是要做被世道一起的殘渣，將來的境遇未必能優於現在。而相反的，有學識，有技能，有適合於現實社會所需要的本領，即處在失業巨潮澎湃洶湧的現在，也有不被捲入失業漩渦得可能。　　所以，失了業的人——尤其是困居於「孤島」的，絕不能被親友們的摩登安慰語所朦誤，也不能因為謀職困難，而把一個期望寄託到最後勝利之後，只要先檢點一下自己，就可肯定自己的命運。倘若自己沒有獨特的學識，技能等等，就要設法補救自己的缺點，修養自己的學識，練習自己感興趣的技能，鍛煉自己的衰弱體質，使之適合於最後勝利之後的國家，社會所需的人才，就無虞失業的鞭子來抽打了。記得高爾基說過：「愚笨的人才怕失業，失業的恐怖只能襲進愚笨的人的腦海……」這兩句話給我們的教訓，就是要我們不怕失業，自己製造出克製失業的能力來。　　內地，無論那一處，抗戰建國的工作都是進賬的，沒有一處不歡迎各部門的真正人，去共同完成復興的大業；有學識，有技能的人才，正不必因居「孤島」，叩求親友之門，處聲下氣去領略幾句「摩登」的安慰語，也不必等待最後勝利之後；有一技之長，僅可占到民族解放得大蠢下去工作，把智和力去換取最後勝利；不但要解決自己的飢餓問題，並且，還要更進一不解決整個的失業問題，為多數的失業羣解決生活。　　所以，我們可以說，坐守家園，等候最後勝利之後在想辦法的失業青年，真無異是自己拋棄職業。在丁溝  童瘦萍　　——流動宣傳記略　　現在第三次出發了，地點是在丁溝。丁溝離開我們根據地大約三十里路。那邊從沒有認去宣傳過，地方情形據說是相當的好。我們便決定去一次，在途中經過三小時，先到了丁溝市立的小學，校長據說在城裏因公未返，由一位姓史的代表招待著。他對我們表示很歡迎，他說：「在這個時候，諸位還能不遠的到我們這窮鄉僻壤的小鎮上來，真是難得。我們也非常的感激！我們這裏的人，很多事抱了各人自掃門前雪的主張，碎玉國家的事，他們根本不願意多聽，更不願意傍的人多說。今天諸位從遠處來，我想定能夠刺激下子的一是在，我們自己的能力太單弱了……、」接著是謙虛地浮出了一陣笑，我們都隨著笑了。　　史先生領著學生都集合到操場上去。首先他給我們介紹了，接著由秋同志演說。　　這裏的一羣開始貼標語，又去買了紙來，臨時寫了許多。　　操場上　起一片掌聲，秋同志的動人演說結束了。接著史先生又作了一次補充。忽然，從遠處飄來了一陣歌聲，西邊的樹林後，一列學生，正徐徐的唱著的歌走來。我問了史先生，綫知道他們的分校長得訊後就集合學生趕來參加了。我們真感覺到無上的興奮！眼望著行列走進操場，有次序地立定了。由史先生的介紹，我們認識了那分校長黃君，在「爲了祖國」的共同目標下，我們親熱的握著手談著。　　漸漸地，一輪淡白色的太陽，從雲層裏看出它緊掛在西塘上的樹梢頭。鶴立著的學生，經過了史先生的吩咐，次第的排成一條長長的行列，跟在我們身後，走出校門，這樣繞鎮遊行了一週。那被撞的歌聲，激昂的口號，在數百個　細喉嚨中，激蕩著全鎮，人們都給轟動了起來！　　夜幕漸漸四下裏合攏來，我們重進該校，開始演講。承史先生的熱心，著實給予很大的助力：在校外的廣場上，特別替我們搭好一座臺，天快黑了，掛上一架汽油燈，光亮的好似白天一樣。四下裏的人，都從黑暗中奔集到這光明的場合來，立定了腳跟，伸著脖子向臺上望著，望著我們在光明的燈下演出：「東北同胞」，「糊塗蛋」，　　觀眾越來越多了，在臺上的我們，可以見到站近的人面部表情，在隨著劇情二　而喜，好些人還在讚在罵。一般于思于思的老公公，念經拜佛的老婆婆，還有一些公子哥兒般的少年——更很有興趣的立在羣眾中凝神注視著。　　夜風襲上廣場，氣溫更低了，然而我們並不覺得冷，觀眾更不覺得冷。我們抵　著，到完成我們的工作，　下臺穿起厚的服裝。最後，人才漸漸的移動，散開，留下了一個寂寞的廣場。　　史先生早給我們預備下住處，在一個小室裏十幾隻課桌拼成了一隻巨床。十二個青年，圍在八九條棉被中，度過了半個嚴冬之夜。呐喊（木刻）  錢銚幻  電長　　曾有過美麗而飄渺的幽夢，在過夜的神經疲乏之後·心底疊起一串，牠濃似酒，然而淡如水，正是將褪盡顏色的時候。　　我……我　　矗立在高山之巔，岌岌然，巍巍然，黃霞摩挲我之頂，儼然如冠，白雲冉冉安撫我之背，更驕傲地抬首，仰天，胸襟淫侵這濃郁的雨露，俯視足下萬千：那蜿蜒曲折的長流，那蓊　莽蒼的田野，那方　伏踞的城廓，那鱗次櫛比的人家，那隆突　　的康　，那水明如鏡的湖沼，偶有幾處煙霞輕鎖，濛濛溟溟，遊絲上漾，裊裊漫漫，又遙睇碧穹外，渺渺無盡……一切都很寧靜，和平！我奇怪：這裏居然有寧靜，和平，牠們幾時　逃這裏來的？來自何方？是我疲乏了，想寧靜和平嗎——世界上的寧靜，和平早已泯滅，死亡，這裏莫不是幻景？　　我就和山之巔道別·我又　　躺在水之　，斜倚在磐石旁，穩穩地用手輕摩一邊茁壯的淺草，潤濕融滑，清心的香味，黑土之營養。偶回頭，盼睞舊處的山，卻成為一抹淡灰，山坳彎彎地，似是眉峯，美麗但憂愁！　　一會，高山褪盡了，淡灰變為茫茫的一片，血糊的一片。我驚訝：茫茫何處尋？（原來先前真個是幻景！）一陣羞恥襲進了心。於是我從磐石旁挺站了進來——磐石卻早腐爛·磐石消滅何速？脊柱祗覺硬化了，呼吸有些窒息，揮手悄無語……我狂嘯，把狂嘯縈繞天地——給悲風帶去四方。不知何處卻又回應過來天籟的古銅聲：洪嗯！　　淵源樹葉中有幾點烏鴉閃著虛偽的翅膀在跳，跳，嘿，這是「寧靜」與「和平」嗎？虛偽呀小醜！我冷冷地笑了。　　我又聽見依稀的哀弱的斷續鼓鳴，調和了冷冽的幽風襲來，似怒蛙，似老牛，更似寒蟲，卻愈鬼魁。牠瑟瑟地橫過田畦，阡陌之中的青翠，就焦，黃，枯，朽，這鼓鳴卻還緊抱著殘枝腐草舞蹈。　　讓它舞蹈罷，這草骷髏的跳舞！我冷笑了。忘記了疲乏。　　我這樣經過了美麗而縹緲的夢。牠不曾濃似酒，神經的curye在向上了。清醒。（義賣獻金）三重奏  楊彥岐　　海之幻想曲　　　海色的風像有異味的靈感。我想振翼飛去，出港口，飄在海面，數浮行船舶，歌離鄉之曲。多少人，奔赴前程；代著各式的心，映著不同的清影，留著異樣的心情，在港內海濱。行子遠去迢迢，白鷗且一程送，送別歸來，又復一陣惆悵。　　海色的風像有異味的靈感。我想潛入水底，靜游去，探盡大洋的秘府，尋覓人間乾淨土。海底的陰沉，一片碧，禁不住軍煙兵火，也染上了紅色斑點。隨了遠征人的心頭火，低歌正義韻律；敷不盡的恨，說不完的情緒，跟著水泡，浮到海面，讓海風吹掉。　　老年人白髮的樂章　　海面的波紋，映出老年人的白髮銀絲。　　每一條細柔的白髮，孕藏了一個心底的幽靈——或者說是死去的玫瑰花吧。　　青年人愛山，老年愛海。　　因為青年人曾在山麓間奔放他們的情感。他們會跑，會跳；會伴著各人身外的靈魂，從這個山峯，攀上另一個石嶺。太陽是他們的；給他們熱和力。尤其在烽火中，穿山越嶺，千萬年輕人合著一條心。　　老年人會在海面上咀嚼他勝餘在心靈深處的味道。月亮石屬於他們的，月亮的永生的光輝，使他冷了的心情重複墮入昔日的夢境。記得是某年的嚴冬，金戈影兒幌出的軍令，戰鼓的怒鳴，曾換得多少敵人的頭顱肝心！或者，或者是某年的五月裏，春光未老，風物逗著人笑，他曾經寫一個美麗的少女留下過紙上文字的影兒；還有，那微雨的薄暮，園地的迷濛春色，正撇下第一點風光，他曾緩步而行，想尋求一個天上藍色的冠冕。如今，藍色的冠冕也祗是紙上的淡痕，受盡時光的腐蝕了。　　白髮裏，又顯出墓地的黃昏；晚霞透過兩排白楊，正是夕陽無限好，春風輕拂柳梢。　　老年人……樂章的餘音像一陣微風，吹在海面上，撩起絲絲微波。　　沒有詩意的故事　　青年人的人生，與老年人的人生，有一個不同。就是：前者是「侍侯的人生」；後者是「被侍侯的人生」。　　所以，海風裏永遠旋著不同的故事。　　青年人愛這個，愛那個；愛女神，愛永生的美。處處把自己認作一個僕人，來侍候所愛得一切——結果是在欣賞刻上人生命的歷史畫。到了老年，需要侍候的時候，心上生命的歷史畫就成了煙絲飄浮的所在。　　不妨講一般戀愛故事吧（人生一切可以用戀愛譬喻）。　　青年的愛，熱如火　；到了老年，　發覺是錯了的。戀愛，應該像吸煙一樣：愉快的燃著了，愉快的吸出煙味，又愉快的擲掉。老年人的鬍子裏，流出一絲笑，笑青年人把一件愉快的事，弄得太嚴肅了。（其實當老年人年輕時，又何嘗不如此呢？這是經人的柔絲！）　　戰地的金戈影兒，震起鬍子裏更安詳的微笑。　　我說過，老年人愛海；所以，海面上又露著一個慈和純白的老年人的像。烏龜哲學  蔣凱　　剛提筆思索題材，隔板王先生大談「打經」，結論是這樣——「大丈夫能屈能伸，好漢不吃眼前虧。」聰明者王先生，精通「處世之道」。此輩人最幸福矣，從不曾吃一點虧，因為他有唯一法寶——「伸縮性」。　　聽了王先生的話，連想起一個故事——「有一個人在晚上做夢，夢見有人給他九塊錢，頗似為不足，再強案一元，湊滿十元。但做到這裏卻被驚醒；跳起休來，細看手中，一無所有。急得尿屁直流，連忙閉緊眼睛，續追前夢，口裏喃喃不休：九塊錢也好，就是九塊……」。伸縮、伸縮……　　最擅長「伸縮」者，人皆公認之為烏龜；烏龜之於人類，似乎太不相稱。可是，牠底載衛人類偏喜採用之，並對於所謂「烏龜哲學」（？）造詣殊深；它是最「現實」的，不會吃虧，或情願自己吃虧，得到了便宜，坐享「伸縮」之福。這樣，用「伸縮」做後盾，於是萬事不怕，都可妥治了。　　另外，也難怪：開口「和平」，閉口「什麽」，……這是在是熟讀了「烏龜哲學」，早已獲有心得，要伸就伸，要縮就縮：「伸」則出風頭，猛烈突破；「縮」則保地位，佔居點綫，所謂符於「大丈夫能屈能伸」是也。　　屈者，縮者，萬一一屈不伸，冤做「屈死」，那就悲哉了！</p>

<p>經濟專刋論所謂「華興商業銀行」及其作用  寒暉　　南京「維新政府」和日商銀行合設的所謂「華興商業銀行」，在天津「聯銀券」市價慘跌中在上海創立了。據該行「總裁」陳錦濤和興亞院聯絡部津田表示：「該行資本五千萬圓，日偽各半，將發行與法幣同價的「華興券」，「當能自由兌換外貨」」。津田並有「日本僑民將有首先使用其銀行券」之語。好些人以為北方「聯銀」券價格慘落，欲代替法幣的作用，已歸失敗，今日還想在上海及江南推行「華興」券，殊為不解。其實，這個問題，決非如一般人想像中那麼簡單，值得仔細推究。　　帝國主義經濟侵略的發展過程，是由商品輸出進入資本輸出。然而資本輸出時代，並不停止商品輸出，而更須擴大其商品輸出，以增加其資本的累積。資本輸出的目的，是操縱殖民地的金融和產業，——尤其是操縱殖民地的貨幣制度。所謂美元集團，英鎊集團，即是資本輸出最成功的表現。日本因重工業原料缺乏，產業基礎建築於輕工業；國際收支的平衡，全賴輕工業，甚至農村半製品（如絲繭）的輸出。至於輸出的資本，除東三省較有成績外，此外就不能和英美法各國競爭。且其輕工業主要原料如羊毛棉花，仍須仰給予國外。「九一八」後，侵奪了我國東四省，固然解決了牠重工業原料的缺乏，而輕工業主要原料的貧乏，仍未解決。爲了解決這種困難，故有內蒙及華北特殊化，和所謂日「滿」支聯合的「日元集團」運動。可是日本經營東四省，已竭其資本的大部分，實無餘力實現這種陰謀，又因中央法幣政策的成功，和華北當局的堅毅支持，所謂中日經濟提攜，日元集團的計劃，全部失敗。日軍佔領華北以後，就由「北平臨時政府」創立的「聯合準備銀行」發行「聯銀」券，其計劃是根本消滅法幣，而為北方唯一的通貨，實現牠日元集團的陰謀。可是，事實上，華北的法幣勢力，決不如奉票一般的脆弱，所以「聯銀」券在日軍的鎗刺下推行逾年，仍祗限於若干日軍城市據點以內，並未成為北方唯一的通貨。其失敗原因很多，大致說來：　　（一）因日本長期侵華戰爭的結束，公債濫發，通貨膨脹，日元的價格動搖，與日元聯繫的「聯銀」券，其價格自難免暴落。　　（二）法幣準備充足，最近外匯平衡準備金成立，上海的「黑市」，亦相當穩定，人民一致信仰。　　（三）日偽統治勢力，尚侷促於若干城市據點，大部土地仍在中央政府統治之下。　　（四）天津租界區的白銀，劫奪不成，英美法各外商銀行一致拒絕「聯銀」券。　　（五）聯銀券並無準備，發行數額甚鉅，以致物價高漲，券價慘跌。（偽券之天津市價曾跌至僅值法幣六角左右。）　　（六）最近中央軍事上反攻的勝利。　　因此，「聯銀」券祗在日軍佔領的北方都市中勉強通行，而一入農村，便為法幣的世界，絕無「聯銀」券通行的餘地。日本發行「聯銀」券，以代替法幣的陰謀，在北方可說已告失敗。但因利用「聯銀」統制外匯，限制進出口貿易，促進日本商品的推銷，却已有相當成效，觀於本年度第一季日貨進口激增，歐美各國貨物輸入激減，可為明證。　　在日軍於前年的初佔領上海及江南時，強迫使用若干軍用票，其原意，以為此等軍用票，一經使用於佔領區，祗須花了一些印刷費，即可無償的換到鉅額的農產品，以充其輕工業的原料及其食糧，以挽救其將崩壞的經濟機構。然而中國商人收集此項軍用票後，迅即到上海或其他商埠向日本商人購買日貨。日本商品的輸入，雖在急劇的增加，但其無償的取得工業原料和食糧的目的，既未達到，反白賠了可以取得的外匯出口資源。日本中小商人雖不敢公然拒絕軍用票，但已怨聲載道。日本原意，這種軍用票，可以減輕其惡性通貨膨脹的危機，現在已完全失敗了。所以這一次設立的「華興銀行」，形式上與北方的「聯銀」不同，主要者有二：　　第一，性質上的不同：「聯銀」為『北京臨時政府』及強迫北方各銀行而合組，「華興」則為『南京維新政府』及日本六大銀行所投資。前者雖說可向朝鮮銀行成立信用借款，但非日本各銀行直接投資，後者却很顯明的為日本六大銀行所合股。日『華興』兩字下又加『商業』兩字，更與「聯銀」的之所謂「國家銀行」的性質可比。　　第二，券價的不同：「聯銀」券與日元平價，作用為代替法幣（其失敗已如上述），「華興」券據說以代替法幣為準備。並不與日元連繫。　　至於發行「華興券」的作用，約有下列四項：　　（一）日本利用「華興」券於日均佔領區內，兌取法幣，而在上海『黑市』中吸收外匯，侵蝕法幣的準備金。以增加其侵華軍費的支付力。　　日本欲以「華興」券，在佔領區內長期的無限制的掠取工業原料品和食糧，而拒絕中國商人以『華興』券直接購買日貨，使日本中小商人不致再有收受軍用票的痛苦。　　（三）日偽利用『華興』券以支付駐華日軍費的一部份及偽組織之經費。以彌補日偽雙方的財政恐慌。　　（四）「華興」銀行或將為日本統制上海及江南外匯及國外貿易的機關。牠將強迫出口商人將外匯買與「華興」，由此，一方可以充實日元的準備，一方又利用長江及內河運輸的　佔，促進日本商品的輸入，排擠歐美商品的市場。也就是欲以商品輸出的擴大，以增加其資本的累積。　　上述四項作用，可說是同時並進的，其終極目的，無非是排斥英美的經濟權益，破壞法幣制度，而完成其上海金融市場亦加入日元集團的迷夢。但這種目的，決無實現可能。　　第一，如以「華興」券收兌法幣，因法幣信用穩固，「華興」券發行額又無限制，故佔領區內人民勢必收　法幣，抬高法幣價格，「華興」券價的慘落，自在意中。　　第二，「華興」券濫發的結果，淪陷區內的物價勢必高漲：不　日本收買江南農產品以充工業原料及食糧的進行受打擊，且因佔領區內人民購買力的減低，　使日貨輸入激減。　　第三，「華興」券價慘跌，物價高漲，勢必引起戰區內的中國商人的破產，則依恃城市商人的偽組織財政，勢必更其恐慌，而日軍就地給養的辦法，勢必更起困難。　　第四，如日本在上海利用「華興」銀行統制外匯，在客觀的環境上看來，實難成功。　　上述的矛盾，乃是「華興」券發行後必至的結果，非特不能使日本經濟機構，受到援助，反而加速牠的崩潰。日本也見到這種危機，所以至今尚未證實統制上海外匯的計劃，欲以其他的手段，來引誘中國和歐美商人的合作，其成功的希望，更極渺茫。所以雖有「創立會」的先聲，但至今尚未有下文，可知其自我懷疑程度之高。本刊第二次座談記錄　平衡物價問題（續）　　日期　四月四六日上午十時起　　地點　本報五樓會議廳　　王雨桐：目前上海一地、雖已形成特殊環境；然人口急劇增加，物價猛騰不已，有關於國計民生者至巨。況上海迄今猶不失為戰時中國之經濟中心，故現時除已受某種勢力所操縱之商品外，吾人亟宜設法安定滬市物價。其於整個戰時經濟所盡之責任，固非僅以下述之從道義的及維持社會安甯為出發點者，所可形其萬一，統制方法擬列三點：　　一，從道義的出發點，由各同業公會按照實際物品供求關係，乘國民奉公精神，實行個別的自治統制。　　二，為維持社會秩序安甯起見，由各公團聯合請求市政當局，責令各同業公會共同切實研究統制方法，如前次平衡米價，即其一例。　　三，積極的覓求代用品與獎勵代用品之發明。　　章子雲：目下物價升漲，其主要原因，既在生產減少，同時如消費能自動減少，物價升漲之趨勢，當可較緩，故提倡民間節約運動亦是平衡物價的一種辦法。　　劉星晨：鄉間農品物產價，普遍下降；都市物價則一致上漲。這由於貨物不暢其流所致。所以要談平衡，打通運輸綫是第一要着。同時又應提高鄉間物價。　　李權時：對啦，總要土產　　才行。　　朱斯煌：對於房租，金融業很可從中盡一些責任。因為銀錢業除自置房產外，多受託為經租賬房。即以經租賬房的地位來說，很可業主和房客之間，任調停之職。如碰到業主呌他辦理加租手續時，他們很能從旁講幾句公道話，雙方勸告，獲得公平合理的解決。　　除了銀錢界外，法院對於加房租問題，更應督用其判決之權，力求真理之平。那末房租糾紛，也得解決不少了。　　李權時：假使工部局能限制外埠的人口來滬，像難民等來滬，上海物價便可下降。但事實上這是決計辦不到的，因為人道主義與惻隱之心是人類所同具的。　　朱斯煌：物價上漲不是完全有害的。如外貨漲價，可以減少非必需品的輸入，奢侈品漲價，可以減少浪費。不過日用必需物品的漲價，大足影響人民生計。所以對於穩定物價之方針，不需在一切物價都回平。奢侈品的價格，愈漲愈好。單就必需品的物價，有適當的調節好了。至於穩定必需品價格的政策，固覺困難，但亦並非完全沒有希望。茲就管見所及，分陳如下：　　一，政府於可能範圍儘量調整供需　政府雖然西移，但對於淪陷區域的經濟狀況，仍刻刻關懷，如對於上海交易所復業，政府與人民，都很慎重。上海人士，愛國之心，不減往昔。所以政府於可能範圍，仍當儘量統制。　　二，商人自動的平價運動　同業公會和市商會，應　同議定平價辦法，一體遵行。此種團體，固然是代表各業利益的機關；但各業中不乏見識高超之士，即不為民生着想，也要知物價高漲過速，將來回跌亦愈烈，只顧目前利益，適足造成將來的失敗。所以為各業本身的利益着想，也應放大眼光，由各同業公會自動的議定平價的方案，取締囤積居奇投機操縱，正所以保全他們將來的利益。且市商會實有一種地方公益機關的性質，更當顧全民生利益，登高一呼，起而創導呢。　　三，提倡節約　提倡節約，就是減少無謂的消費，一方可以消費者的力量，抵禦供方操縱。　　四，金融業放款的注意　金融業信用的收縮和膨脹，影響於物價很大。故對於放款貼現，當密切注意，切不可以信用資助囤積，滋長投機。現在金融業對於放款，大多都很審慎。總之對於安定物價一點，金融業者不能辭其責任。物價上漲中之糖市情形  朱耕莘　　作者是上海信益公司的負責人，國內著名的糖商。本文原為本刊舉行之物價座談會所準備的書面報告，從中提出了國內外糖市的前途。與糖價的差異，使我們對於這主要調味品的物價趨勢，獲得一個正確的概念，希讀者注意。　編者　　近來上海糖價步昂，一因國產來源減少，二因洋糖成本昂貴；按戰前廣東機製白糖來滬，每年有三十萬公担；今亦絕跡。閩廣土糖，運輸困難，往年有五六十萬擔（白糖只佔一二成）可來，今則不過三十萬公担而已。荷蘭糖（即爪哇產）因外匯暗漲，成本較貴；有此二種原因，所以價格提高也。　　惟香港太古煉糖廠，際此時機，營業頗盛；目前上海所銷白糖，爪哇粗砂，與太古綿白，佔十分之八。青糖全賴閩廣土產；赤糖則荷蘭糖佔二成，閩廣糖佔八成；冰糖皆中國自製，上海廠佔八成，廈門廠佔二成。論上海白糖，市價雖昂，若與海外比較，尚屬低廉。查世界出產：蔗糖產額與甜菜糖各佔半數；而蔗糖中向推古巴爪哇印度三處為大宗；今年印度自產自銷，尚欠三十餘萬噸；已向爪哇及歐洲市場買進。日本台灣今年出產比往年增加百餘萬擔，除國內自銷外，其餘傾銷於遠東華北；而華中銷數極微。上海明華廠雖在煉製，僅有小本商人販賣，且其國內市價，更比上海為高。從前日本糖廠原料，除台灣外，不足之數，向爪哇古巴買進；今因限制外匯，不能自由採辦，因此出品不多。至若歐洲甜菜糖，首推德國；今年出產二百餘萬噸，近被各國預備軍需，亦愈不敷；擬向蔗糖製地方補買。綜觀海外糖價，亦是趨向於高的一途。顧上海尚不能漲至海外程度者，因抗戰時期，外洋航綫未斷，來源仍通，內地交通阻隔，銷貨困難，致成供過於求現象。　　中國南方，本為產糖之區，惟望政府獎勵種蔗，保護小規模工業，使各鄉村皆有生產能力，逐年出品增多，對於上海銷路，可以儘量供給，則上海市場，不須再賴洋糖矣。物價上漲中之紗布供求狀況  汪孚禮　　作者係中國棉業與恒鑒紗廠負責人之一，本文原為本刊舉行之物價座談會所準備的書面報告，以內行人談本行話，句句着實，希讀者注意。　編者　　抗戰以還，紗布市價，扶搖直上，二十支金城紗最高值，每件曾到五百十五元，較戰前漲至一倍以上。各種粗細布疋，亦皆隨之倍昂。雖因廣州失守而一度下落，未幾即漸回漲。至今日仍保持相當之高價。外匯緊縮，運輸困難，以及成本加重等，固皆有關係；然以紡織廠受戰爭影響，或停或毀，生產減少，供不應求，實其主因之大者。試閱下文所述，即可知其大概矣。　　查設在中國境內之紡織廠，經營者可分為華商日商英商三種，其戰前所有紗綻及布機數，如第一表所示。　　第一表（摘錄華商紗廠聯合會民國二十六年七月出版之中國紗廠一覽表）　　（甲）華商　　地名　廠數　紗錠數　布機數　　上海市　三一　一、一一四、四〇八　八、七五四　　江蘇省　二三　六

遺精無疑。　　青年人何以多遺精症？據病理的研究，大都因自瀆　傷或先天衰弱病後失調致性神經衰弱之故。因性神經的衰弱，性機能就失其所司，精關呈鬆懈狀態，遺精症即因此而起。此時若治得早，不特體內元氣少受虧損，性神經也容易恢復原狀，若遷延不治，則必元氣大虧，腦，脊髓神經亦將連帶衰弱，則凡腦力遲鈍，記憶不良，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，肢體疲困等症即相繼而來。至於性機能方面，或更爆發滑精漏精，早洩陽痿，發育不全。精薄不育諸種病態。此種男子，處處表演着衰弱無能，既不能求學深造，復不能擇業謀生，即在夫婦生活上亦必不能美滿為妻憎恨，那夫婦之道就苦矣哉！　　欲謀補救，必須根本治愈其疾病。治療之法，則唯有速服「希米脫氏固精片」，最為可靠。因此劑於服後，即可鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，則南柯一夢，既得酣眠之樂，復可根治遺精。若因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，永安公司西藥部，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內治愈上述各症。並益臻健康。患者若能親來本診所就專科醫師診斷後，施用　療注射等法，則更可保證愈治。白濁論壇  淋病專科戴德醫師撰　　診所：北京路四川路轉角　　義務送診僅收號金四角混合性的淋毒膀胱炎　　混合性的淋毒膀胱炎，是指淋毒菌之外，兼混有其他之細菌而起。最顯著者爲大腸菌，連鎖球菌，活解性尿重複菌及淋菌等之細菌，經過尿道或輸尿管而入膀胱，侵襲膀胱壁，遂起膀胱炎，患者多由於受不良之手術，洗滌尿道，及由患者失於攝生。致使本由尿道炎之疾患，轉而入於膀胱，故釀成是病。在急性膀胱炎時，往往惡寒發熱，尿意頻數。每隔十餘分鐘即欲排尿一次，在膀胱部始劇烈之疼痛，尤其於排尿時爲甚。往往尿中混有血液與濃汁，故尿色溷濁，含有蛋白質及血素色，慢性時則上述刺㦸的症狀消失，尿意則每隔一小時或一小時半一次。放尿終了之後，有粘液狀或膿汁狀之物排出。因爲此種症狀極其痛楚而頑固，不能單用內服劑或注射劑所能表功。先須仔細診察，知其淋病之外，更混合何種細菌。用德國濾淋平流電療法，及肛門坐藥，必要時更須實行膀胱洗滌法，半身浴及內服鎭痙劑，始爲最澈底而有效之療法，如其淋毒已經肅淸，而尚剩有他項細菌在內作祟者，則須診查其係何種細菌，然後對症處置，則整個膀胱炎，無不迅速根治，此種症狀，求治於設備不全，及不細心診斷之醫家，絶對無根本解决之望也。　診時：上午九時至午後六時正　　科目　　兼治梅毒，横痃，下疳。及無痛苦新法割除包皮。</p>

<p>春秋走上了新的「生路」  飛雲　　乞丐大學生訪問記　　如若你是看過蘇聯影片「生路」，你是會被那樣故事深深地威動的。一羣流浪在街頭，偷竊，騷擾，常被巡捕趕來趕去的小偷，乞丐們，到後來，他們竟被訓導成爲一個健康，向上，最好的鐵路工人，這，不是一個奇蹟，這是能够利用教育，與合理的方法，剷除社會不良的流浪兒童與乞丐的存在。　　在上海，要把全市的乞丐與小偷們，統統都收養起來，這似乎是一件極困難的工作。不過，有一二個慈善團體，在做着這樣的工作，那倒是眞的。比如厦門路流浪兒童教養院，就是專收街頭小討飯與小偷的；而西愛咸斯路祁齊路西的第二國際收容所裏，所附設的「乞丐寄住所」也便是專門收留乞丐，並且在實施着新的教育的。　　這所乞丐寄住所，所以引起我極大的注意，是因爲聽說那裏面所收留的乞丐中間，竟發現很多大學生，中學生，及許多受過小學教育的，而且，還有一位曾經在金陵女子大學畢業的女學生，竟也淪爲乞丐，聽見這樣消息，不要使人感嘆無窮吧。　　我爲了想知道一點實際詳細的情形，特地到那邊去。當走到西愛咸斯路祁齊路口，就可以發見一片曠塲，曠塲中間搭着一列一列大的蘆蓆棚，鐵管的烟囱在空中冒着姻，這，大的就是第二收容所。在這滬西大洋房住宅區裏，展開着這麽一片苦難的同胞，這正是一幅極好的對照。　　我找着了那裏的楊所長，又湊巧碰見國際收容所教育組幹事徐巽華，承他們倆領導參觀了整個乞丐寄住所。　　這寄住所辦到現在，已經有三四個月，男女幼童乞丐總數是一千三百二十一人，中間包括男的一千二百人，女的一百零二人，兒童九人。　　我問起外傳乞丐大學生的事情，他們特地介紹了一位呌任遂華的和我談話。　　據所中人說，他也是由巡捕在乞丐中間一齊送來的，而我和他自己談話的結果，他說，他父親還在某中學教書，過去曾在稅專念書，也在海關、郵政擔任過職務，後來戰事爆發，他又在地方協會做過職員，他對於淪爲乞丐生活一層，好像不願意承認，僅僅說，他衣裳因爲穿得太襤褸，在南市難民區被送到這裹來的。　　在我們談話中間，他說的幾個英文字發音也很準確，現在，他已昇任乞丐寄住所的職員，對事務辦理得很認眞，所中現在每月還貼他一點錢，也任他自由出入，但他却不肯出去。　　這個人，可以說是乞丐寄住所中的傑出人材。　　第二個呌林世謙，他從前是北平民國大學商學系畢業（二十四年）他英文也很好，但據所中人說，他品性就沒有任遂華好，直到現在一有錢還設法偷偷買白麵喫。　　第三個呌萬百歲，是上海大學經濟系二年級（民國十六年）。　　那位金陵女子大學的女乞丐，已绳由家屬領出去。　　其他還有中學程度的乞丐四十人。這些人，墮落的主要原因，都是抽白麵，看看現在滬西的毒氣瀰漫，眞有點怕人。　　所中還有小規模的工塲，但因爲剛辦，所以被訓練的人還不多。　　整個乞丐數目中，拍鴉片的一百九十五人，抽白麵的二百三十三人，打嗎啡針的二十二人。現在正替他們戒除醫療。每天乞丐們也還給他兩小時的教育及共他活動。關山飛渡  如華　　“Stagecoach”　　聯藝公司出品　大上海開映　　從東土到勞斯堡的路上，一輛長途馬車在荒林中前進，車廂里有懷姙將臨褥的露茜瑪勞夫人，酒販商皮考克，嗜酒若命的醫生彭尼，賭匪哈特菲爾，被東土婦女公會驅逐出境的女郎黛麗絲，還有竊盜銀行巨款的軋伍特，及冀到勞斯堡覓其仇人的逃犯林果。集合了如許複雜的人物而展開的故事，導演者第一先得把各個人的性格淸楚地勾劃出來；第二，更需要雄厚的魄力把故事聯繫起來。「關山飛渡」在前半部戲中，並沒有把道些複雜的人物很明顯地介紹給觀衆，而且馬車在荒林中進行的鏡頭太多，更用了同樣地位的鏡頭。在逃犯林果上車之後，在喝水的各個特寫中，才表明了每個人物的性格之後，他完全着力在「被侮辱與被損害」的黛麗絲和林果身上。如道個被東土婦女公會所驅逐的蕩婦，她是那樣遭受了人家的冷淡之後，還是盡力爲臨褥的露茜瑪勞夫人服侍；而林果也在躍馬逃逸的時候，發現了土人信號，又回到車上來「同車共濟」，劇作者採用了最客觀的叙述方法，來同情這兩個人物的遭遇，這是很好的。　　導演者把這兩塲戲也處理得很好。露茜瑪勞夫人生產的那塲戲，他把當時的空氣抓得很緊，而且他利用狼嗥及孩子的哭聲來陪襯土人的　擊，同時更着力在黛麗絲的善良描寫。土人追逐馬車那該是本片中最精彩的一塲戲了，他用各種角度的鏡頭寫雙方的轟擊情形，而幾個土人從馬背上摔下來，及一個土人吊在馬肚下的鏡頭，都逼眞而緊張。　　在安抵勞斯堡之後，因爲林果的尋覓仇人，導演特別又鋪張了一個高潮，那似乎不必要的，如果以這些膠片來加强黛麗絲和林果的因同情各人的遭遇而結合，及軍曹柯爾萊受了感動而放縱林果，那可以更增强劇作者所以寫這兩個人物的力量。瘋狂之症  佛　　人到無法擺布之時，往往失其理智駕馭之能力，而入於瘋狂狀態。　　所謂「馬極跳墻，犬極噬人，」故人到窮極無聊，大抵不擇手段，不顧是非，不顧人道，一味　幹到底，但是這種蠻幹，決不足以挽回窮極者之命運，無非一種洩憤主義而已。　　惟此種瘋在之病，不易醫治，只能瘋狂之藥治之，此外無藥可救也。雨過天青  包天笑　　第十回　椎髻青裙賢良有母　銀髯翠袖矍鑠是翁　　可是朱愛人回國以後，她服務於醫務很忙，尤其是她的出洋留學，完全是她的義母章醫師之力。如今回國來，自然要帮章醫師的　，章醫師爲社會上培植一個人村，報答章醫師，便是報答社會。所以她住在自由村家裏的時候很少，即使是爲着問候祖父及母親，來到自山村，也不過住居一天兩天，忽忽地就要去了。不去時，老章醫師便耍打電話來催了，因此她對於家庭，有如逆旅一般。朱村長以爲道樓房是挺講究了，也預備了　中一切器物，讓這位孫小姐樓居，也像中國人說的高樓上小姐勞髴。但朱愛人在美國，世界上最講究的房子，也曾住過。到中國來，爲了給人家診病，半夜不得歸來，最卑陋的屋子，也曾宿過。可知現在的小姐，不能固定的住在高樓上咧。因此這所樓房是空着，朱太太却住在樓東首一問。朱太太也和她的阿公一樣的睥氣，她不喜歡住樓房的，現在看看那座樓房是空關着，她有些捨小得，住在那裏，只算是看屋子罷了。倘然何家兩小姐來了，要在自由村住幾天的，便要住在這樓上了。那地方一切設備，不用說，都是不完全的，但是到鄉下地方來，也只好媽媽虎虎了。朱村長年紀雖老，精神强健。他的孫女兒，出出進進，開着汽車，伸不但沒有汽車，連公共汽車他也不要坐，寗可安步當車，自誇腰脚很健。還有朱愛人的母親朱太太，有時到安樂鎭婦孺醫院去看她的女兒朱醫師，也不坐公共汽車，也不坐小汽油船，她就大踏步山自由村走到安樂鎭。這其間，相距也要十幾里路呢，她路上走得熱起來了，便脫去裏面一件絨綫衫，摜在肩頭上再走。走走又熱了，在樹蔭下，乘一回凉再走。誰知道這一位，便是美國女醫學博士朱愛人醫師的母親呢。到了醫院裹，回去的時候，女兒要用汽車送她回去，她執定不要。說汽車是你們公務上用的，萬一有一個病人，急於診病，要用汽車，而汽車却被我這沒要緊人占用了，豈不耽誤了事，使我心中不安。我現在走走豈不自山，隨地都可以休息，　且昏頭昏腦，我也坐不大　那汽車咧。（一一〇）亂離雜感（集龔定庵句）（上）  素衣　　金粉東南十五州。重來不見綠雲稠。　　我從瑣碎搜文獻。一夜吟魂萬里愁。　　紅豆年年擲逝波。靑山靑史兩磋跎。　　祇今曠刧重生後。獨倚東南涕淚多。　　錯怨蛾眉解用兵。菰蘆深處有人行。　　絕憐羿道無消息。東海潮來月怒明。　　七里虹橋腐草腥。鬼燈隊隊散秋螢。　　夕陽忽下中原去。露重風多不敢停。　　（由昆陵避難至申江）　　何必滄桑始浩歎。落梅風裏別江南。　　湖山曠刧三吳地。淚漬蟫魚死不乾。　　（毘陵寓廬書籍字畫悉燬於刧火）　　預憐夜兩閉門時。下筆情深不自持。　　僥倖故人仍滿眼。皇天竺胙總無私。　　平生幾　履難尋。文字緣同骨肉深。　　誰分江湖搖落後。天涯有弟話秋心。　　（喜晤范拜竹盟弟）　　迢遞湖山赴夢魂。中年百事畏重論。　　照人膽似秦時月。此是平生未報恩。　　（柬李揆新盟弟豐城）　　爭將晚節需情夸。忽向東山感歲華。　　莫怨津梁爲客久。南遊且喫玉川茶。　　（柬莊　之先生）　　昨夜江潮平未平。淮陰重話七年情。　　白雲出處從無例。忽遇天風吹便行。　　（戊寅春杪至淮陰喜晤向鄉諸友好）　　絕業名山幸早成。詞鋒落月互縱橫。　　一門鼎盛親風雅。前輩鬚眉照座淸。　　（呈鄉前輩錢名山先生）　　歌泣無端字字眞。江南第一斷腸人。　　書生挾策成何濟。冉冉修名獨愴神。　　少爲賤士抱弗宣。涓滴無由補大川。　　別有樽前揮涕語。東南幽恨滿詞箋。　　少年哀樂過於人。慘綠年華記憶眞。　　萬恨沉霾向誰咎。衆中俯仰不材身。　　風雲材略已銷磨。其奈尊前百感何。　　吟到恩仇心事湧。側身天地我蹉跎。　　（義賣獻金）</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Chinese and foreign reporters interviewed Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui today, requesting his opinion on the recent actions of the Japanese in Southern China. He gave the following statement: The Japanese Consul in Gulangyu was originally a member of the Gulangyu Municipal Council. Now the Japanese army has landed in the Gulangyu concession without prior notification to the Municipal Council. This is intended to test the true attitudes of the powers towards the Far East and is a preliminary action by Japan to seize the Shanghai International Settlement and other areas in similar positions. Japan's contempt for the rights and interests of third countries is not a recent decision. Today we can say that if the powers wish their rights and interests not to be excluded from the Far East, their only strategy is to adopt sanctions and retaliatory measures against the Japanese aggressors. (Fourteenth Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from here today, Britain considers Japan's occupation of Gulangyu and interference in the administration of the International Settlement to be extremely serious. The British government's attitude was stated in Parliament yesterday. Foreign Office officials also deeply fear that Japan may proceed to occupy the Shanghai International Settlement. The British government stated in Parliament yesterday that Britain does not consider the Japanese army's landing on Gulangyu to be a violation of Japan's treaty rights, provided it does not interfere in the administration of the settlement. Regarding the question of answering Japan's proposed amendments to the Shanghai Land Regulations, the British Foreign Office is still exchanging views with the US State Department. Although the British and American governments are currently studying this issue separately, because they are in close communication, the contents of the replies will necessarily be substantially the same.

<h3 id="e10">The Alleged Sino-Soviet Secret Agreement <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Psychologically, it is imitation; pathologically, it is contagion. Thus, there are always things that suddenly become popular with the times. Regarding the current European international situation, with its intricate plotting, scheming, and alliances for mutual benefit, it is thriving for a time. The lingering influence has even led some to claim that the Far East is following suit. As yesterday's newspaper reported, Reuters Tokyo reported that two newspapers published reports claiming China and the Soviet Union had concluded a secret agreement. We do not believe that China and the Soviet Union have been infected in this way. It is likely a bored person imitating the current trend and making a sensationalist speculation. Newspaper A claimed that the Soviet Union supplied China with pilots and mechanics in unlimited quantities, and also provided a loan of 400 million yuan for China to purchase military supplies, with 50 million yuan jointly establishing a Sino-Soviet arms import company in Wenzhou. Newspaper B claimed that the Soviet Union was demanding a price for its assistance to China in resisting Japan. The matter was negotiated by Sun Ke in Moscow, and what had been approved by Chairman Chiang included the following points: First, China must consult with Moscow before accepting mediation from any third country; second, China should absolutely eliminate all those in the National Government and other jurisdictions who advocate peace; third, China should ensure that the equipment and treatment of the Central Army, the Communist Army, and the armies of various provinces are uniform; fourth, designate the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang as special administrative regions, with Mao Zedong as chairman, garrisoned solely by the Communist Army, and the Soviet Union will be allowed to develop the resources of the three provinces and send a military officer as a military representative; fifth, China should hire Soviet experts as military training officers to train soldiers and pilots; sixth, open land and air routes between Xi'an and Moscow, via Lanzhou, Hami, and Dihua; and in exchange, the Soviet Union would provide China with unlimited material and technical assistance.</p>
<p>Given the limitations of time, we are unable to ascertain how the authorities of China and the Soviet Union will respond to this report; whether they will acknowledge it, deny it, or remain silent is all unknown. Let us analyze the report as it stands, and it can be seen that there is nothing that does not contradict reality and reason. The authorities of both countries will likely deem it not worth acknowledging because of its complete falsehood and its infantile absurdity. As we know and believe, since China launched a full-scale war of resistance, all countries except the aggressor have given China sympathy and assistance, not just the Soviet Union alone. The Soviet Union has long provided China with extensive material and technical assistance, not just starting now; it is based on morality and mutual trust, so there are no conditions and no secrets. The Soviet Union is rich in arms production but short of gold and silver, and what China expects from the Soviet Union is the former, not the latter, so there has never been any mention of a so-called loan; moreover, for direct transfers between governments, there is no need to allocate funds and establish a company. The two countries' air route between Chongqing and Moscow has already been publicly test-flown, so why is it necessary to demand it as a secret condition? All these points, in fact, in spirit, and in the nature of their implications, are higher than what the Eastern Daily claims; they are even more valuable. This is something that the Eastern Daily cannot measure or understand. As for the so-called hiring of experts, China has historically invited many foreign advisors, but this is an action taken independently by the government, not restricted by international treaties; China is fighting to resist aggression and to fight for freedom, and would not willingly sacrifice the freedom to hire experts to so-called secrets. Furthermore, to say that the three provinces are designated as special regions, with whom in charge, which army garrisoned, and which country has exclusive rights, is the desire of the aggressor, which does not apply to the Soviet Union; if the Eastern Daily expresses such a tone, is it not a case of the benevolent seeing benevolence and the wise seeing wisdom, and does it not have its own source? As for the so-called uniformity in the equipment and treatment of all armies, the Chinese military authorities have previously rejected this as a divisive statement; uniformity in treatment has been implemented for some time, but disparities in equipment are limited by reality; moreover, since the war of resistance, the troops are divided by region, not by so-called Central and Communist divisions; equipment is gradually enriched and improved as permitted by the actual situation, and this has nothing to do with region. All these points, not only can it be asserted that they are not true by refuting them with facts, but it can also be deduced from reason that the Chinese and Soviet sides would never make these secret conditions. As for not being able to accept mediation from other countries without first consulting with Moscow, and absolutely eliminating pro-peace factions, these are the tones of turncoat elements, whose words seem to express resentment towards the Soviet Union, but in reality, they seek to slander the Chinese government as being communist; imitation and contagion, interwoven with each other, are then taken as materials for proposing secret agreements.</p>
<p>Since there are contradictions in the international arena, there are also interests; since there are interests, there are also friends and enemies; since there are friends and enemies, there are either hostilities and wars, or alliances, or agreements, or secret agreements; each sees what is needed, and each takes what is appropriate. These are common practices and common methods, and there is nothing to be surprised at. Moreover, these so-called methods and patterns, although they will necessarily have their consequences, generally speaking, it is not so much that treaties create the situation, but rather that the situation creates treaties; for example, the Anglo-French alliance is the product of the union of Britain and France, not that the alliance made Britain and France unite; such as the German-Italian alliance, is the product of the union of Germany and Italy, not the alliance that made Germany and Italy unite; the Soviet Union, England and France, Japan, Germany and Italy, are the non-compliance of the road, is a combination of sound, today's distance, and the contract? From this point of view, the Sino-Soviet alliance, is not absolutely impossible, and that the English and French security after Poland and Romania, the Soviet Union in the West felt threatened by a slight slip, then in the East will be more actively reason more, that is, the Sino-Soviet Union of the same power to stabilize the Far East who, the conditions are also more prepared, is that the Sino-Soviet two countries or the scope of not only two countries, if in the near future, take a reasonable approach, by what important manifestation, what developments, are all not enough to be a strange phenomenon, still must be in the form of mutual, the principle of equality and freedom, is not like the East Daily's secret agreement, which can be asserted.</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Yesterday, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a closing address to the National Production Conference, stating that the importance of this conference is like any military conference, because military strength depends on the success of the nation's economic recovery. He further stated that the efforts of the conference's representatives to increase national production have enhanced the power to resist enemy aggression. At the same time, Finance Minister Dr. Kong Xiangxi also gave a speech. The plans discussed at the conference included the following items: 1. Develop and promote small-scale industries; 2. Construct light railways; 3. Find ways to bring trained workers from Japanese-occupied areas to areas currently under the control of the Chinese government; 4. In order to assist guerrillas in continuing their resistance against Japanese aggression, efforts will be made to develop cooperatives and other small-scale industries in Japanese-occupied areas. A representative of the conference told the Associated Press that the most unique contribution of the decision conference was the establishment of a new truck assembly plant in Western China. The capital of the plant will be 500,000 yuan, and it is expected to produce 40 trucks per month. The work of the plant will be assembly, and all parts will be purchased from American manufacturers. In the past, China purchased assembled trucks from American companies such as General Motors and Dodge, which consumed a great deal of money. The decision of the conference to establish an assembly plant will definitely save the government a lot of money. (Fourteenth Day Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e12">President Kong's Opening Speech <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The National Production Conference opened in Chongqing on the 7th. President Kong personally attended and delivered an opening speech. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Esteemed members, the opening date of this production conference was originally scheduled for the 5th, which is the day eight years ago when the Prime Minister took office as the Extraordinary President, with the intention of learning from the Prime Minister's arduous struggle in those years, and devoting ourselves to the current major undertaking of production and construction. However, due to the Japanese reckless bombing of our rear areas, transportation within the city was difficult, so it was slightly delayed. Today's meeting coincides with the anniversary of the National Humiliation of May 7th, which is the day when Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to Yuan Shikai. We recall the difficulties in the creation of the country, feel the tyranny of our current situation, and cherish the heavy responsibility of the future. Under the two major goals of resisting aggression and building the nation today, our duty is to continuously review and continuously encourage. The convening of the National Production Conference is based on this opportunity. During the war of resistance, this is more important than other gatherings, and its significance is particularly profound. The material supplies required for the war of resistance are vast, and the key to winning or losing depends on whether the economy and material resources can be sustained for a long time. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "Modern warfare is a final match between the human, physical, and financial resources of countries, and those whose economy and material resources can provide sustainable supplies will win the final victory." For more than a year, the Japanese have done everything possible to destroy China's economy and finances. Fortunately, with the efforts of the government and the enthusiastic maintenance of the people, economic construction in the interior can still continue, and the credit of the legal tender is becoming more and more consolidated. Recently, the price of counterfeit currency in North China has plummeted repeatedly. Although the Japanese have used various means to try to salvage it, they have ultimately been helpless. It must be known that counterfeit currency and Japanese currency are the same set of ghosts. The tragic fall in the price of counterfeit currency is equivalent to the tragic fall in the price of Japanese currency. Judging from this, China has already defeated the Japanese in the economic field. If we can continue to work hard, strive for production, and continuously supply and continuously strengthen our material and financial resources, then the war of resistance will surely win, and the construction of the country will not be difficult to achieve.

<p>(Chongqing) The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement, in order to make the world's public more aware of the brutality of the Japanese invasion and to promote sanctions against Japan, has wired the Anti-Aggression League in Geneva, detailing the reality of the Japanese air raids on Chongqing.  It particularly pointed out that the despicable tactics of the Japanese are a manifestation of their increasingly weakened position. Such tactics are not only ineffective, but also deepen the understanding of the Chinese people of the cruel face of the Japanese, further fueling the popular spirit of shared hatred and determination to resist to the end. The branch also urged the League to find ways to promote the implementation of various proposals of the Paris Anti-Bombing of Undefended Cities Conference and to strengthen effective sanctions against Japan by various countries. (14th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington)  Relations between the United States and Japan have apparently suffered another blow due to reports of indiscriminate bombing of Chinese cities and towns by Japan. According to a message revealed yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, has been instructed by the State Department to lodge a strong verbal protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry, based on humanitarian grounds, against the Japanese air raids on Chongqing, Shantou, Ningbo, and Fuzhou.  According to Hull, this protest is fully in line with the United States' abhorrence of bombing defenseless civilians, women, and children, as most of the cities bombed by the Japanese are undefended and without significant military targets.  At the same time, the reason for the United States' protest is to draw the attention of the U.S. Congress and American public opinion to the brutal bombing by the Japanese.  It is claimed that the death toll of Chinese civilians in the Japanese bombing of Chongqing last week reached as many as 7,000. According to observers here, if Japan continues to bomb undefended cities, the U.S. Congress will accelerate its ban on trade with Japan, thus depriving Japan of more than 50% of the supplies for its war of aggression against China.  It is noted that U.S.-Japan relations have been strained due to Japan's continued destruction of American interests in China, its further demand for amendments to the Shanghai Land Regulations, its recent occupation of Gulangyu in the Xiamen International Settlement, its disregard for various U.S. protests, and its continued expansion southward, threatening the Philippines. All these actions have contributed to the poor impression of Japan in the U.S. officialdom. (14th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary Hull recently issued a statement to the newspapers, saying that after Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing, Shantou, Ningbo, and Fuzhou, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, was instructed by the State Department to lodge a verbal protest with the Japanese government. Ambassador Grew has not yet reported on how the Japanese government responded. The State Department's instructions were based on its consistent attitude, namely, that the U.S. government condemns all acts of bombing ordinary people. In addition, regarding the Gulangyu incident in China, the U.S. Consul there, McVeitty, recently reported by telegram that after the assassination of the "Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce" in Xiamen City, 150 Japanese Marines occupied the Gulangyu International Settlement and arrested people everywhere. It is still unknown how the Consul is negotiating with the Japanese authorities. (13th, Havas Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e14">After Repeated Tragic Bombings: Chongqing Municipal Government's Reorganization Plan; Clearing Disaster Areas, Rectifying the City's Appearance; Continuing Evacuation of the Elderly, Weak, Women and Children <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing)  Your correspondent visited a responsible official on the 14th to inquire about the relief situation for the disaster victims in Chongqing and the future reorganization plan for the municipal government. The official replied that after the Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed the city on the 3rd, 4th, 12th, and 13th of this month, the supreme leader immediately ordered the government to allocate huge sums of money for emergency relief. At the same time, he ordered Party, government, and military agencies to organize service teams, concentrate vehicles and ships, and actively transport citizens away from the disaster areas.  Within the five, six, and seven days, the number of citizens evacuated, according to statistics, had reached about 250,000.  Afterwards, the number of citizens who took free boats and left one after another on their own is not included in this figure. After the citizens were evacuated to safe areas such as [omitted], the service teams either found houses for them and lodged them in residents' homes, or guided them to temporary shelters set up by the government.  The equipment for their food, medicine, and security has also been properly arranged in an orderly manner, which is very convenient for the citizens.  Chongqing is the wartime capital of China, so Commander-in-Chief Liu specially transferred a certain unit of the army to join the service teams of various agencies, and under the command of Chief of Staff He, actively cleared the disaster areas and rectified the city's appearance. However, in order to reduce unnecessary sacrifices, the government should continue to work hard to evacuate the elderly, weak, women, and children, as well as various agencies that do not need to stay in Chongqing. As for the areas near Chongqing, those who cannot leave Chongqing due to production or job reasons will be investigated and registered by the authorities, issued certificates, and strictly organized into Baojia [a system of neighborhood control] with leaders assigned to them, so that the citizens staying in Chongqing can carry out their business and work as usual in an organized and planned manner. After the new mayor He Guoguang takes office, there should be more active measures on the municipal administration of Chongqing, the wartime capital, in the future. Under the guidance and supervision of the supreme leader, the orderliness of social order, the solemn atmosphere, and the tension of the work of civil servants and ordinary citizens in this wartime capital are all within expectations.

<h3 id="e16">Japanese Planes Shot Down; Seven Found <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, the authorities transported three Japanese aircraft shot down near Chongqing on May 3 to the Central Park for exhibition. When the coolies transported the remaining parts of the three aircraft to the Central Park, the crowd lined up and followed behind. According to the Chinese authorities, a total of eleven Japanese aircraft were shot down by the Chinese side on May 3 and 4, of which seven have been found. All the shot-down Japanese aircraft were manufactured in Italy or Germany, and the machine guns inside were British Vickers. The three Japanese aircraft exhibited in the Central Park were all shot down by Chinese fighter planes, as many machine gun holes can still be seen in the fuselage. Furthermore, according to several Chinese people, the bodies of Italian pilots were found in many of the downed Japanese aircraft, but this has not yet been confirmed. Today, senior Chinese authorities declared that two of the three Japanese aircraft shot down on Friday night have been found. Foreign observers said that the three aircraft (i.e., the Japanese aircraft shot down on Friday night) were clearly shot down by anti-aircraft guns, at least one of which has been conclusively proven. The misbombing of Jiangfu and Tanchizi (transliterations) by Japanese aircraft that night (Friday night) was actually due to the effective intensive firing of Chinese anti-aircraft guns. Initially, 27 Japanese aircraft flew in formation from the north, but because the sky was dark and it was difficult to find targets, they dispersed the formation and flew low in order to find their targets, resulting in flying into the range of the anti-aircraft guns and three being shot down.

<p>(Chongqing) Today, a counselor at the British Embassy told an Associated Press reporter that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, caught a cold while in Chengdu and is now bedridden at home, unable to go to the embassy to work. It is said that last Monday, when Ambassador Kerr was in Chengdu, officials of the province held a banquet to welcome him. Before the banquet ended, an air raid alarm occurred, so Chinese officials insisted on asking him to take shelter temporarily in the open fields outside the city. As a result, the Japanese aircraft did not come, but Ambassador Kerr and Chinese officials stood in the suburbs all night. A few days later, he suddenly had alternating chills and fever, and was bedridden, unable to work. (13th, Associated Press)</p>

<h3 id="e19">European Anti-Aggression Front Nearing Completion; Mussolini Advocates Peace, Saying European Issues Not Enough to Cause War; Desires Towards France Still Expressed Through Audience's Slogans <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Turin: Premier Mussolini delivered a speech here at the Piazza 爱麦虞限 at eleven o'clock this morning, saying that ten years ago, I delivered a speech here and concluded, "Advance, build, and, if necessary, fight!" Since then, the Italian people have taken these words as their guide and moved forward, fighting in Africa, breaking away to deal with the sanctions of the League of Nations, and recently fighting in Spain, thus creating the Italian Empire, annexing Albania, and becoming stronger in all aspects. Today, the question before us is one of peace or war. "After reviewing the current situation with an objective attitude, I dare to answer that the various problems in Europe, both in importance and urgency, are not enough to cause a war. The crux of the European political situation must be resolved, and even this does not require resorting to arms. This is the view of Italy, and so is Germany. As for the friendship between Germany and Italy, the military and political agreement agreed upon by the two authorities in Milan the other day will be signed in Berlin at the end of this month. The closer our cooperation with Germany, the more we can lay the foundation for peace in Europe based on justice to fulfill the hope of the people of all countries. Regarding this, foreign people often talk about strategy in cafes, and their absurdity is not worth laughing at." (The audience shouted slogans such as "We demand Nice, Savoy, Tunisia.") "The democracies speak of peace, but it is doubtful whether we sincerely desire peace. Germany, Italy, and Japan have never occupied an inch of land of the major democracies. If these democracies sincerely desire peace, why are they conducting an "economic war" against Germany, Italy, and Japan? If these democracies think that war can be won with gold, it is a great mistake. It should be known that the way to win relies on determination and courage. Germany and Italy have a population of 150 million, and the number is increasing. We have now formed a great group from the Baltic Sea to the Indian Ocean, and we will never allow other countries to control us. The situation created by the Treaty of Versailles has collapsed, and the mutual guarantee measures of various countries must also fail. It is under these circumstances that we are expanding our military preparations day by day in order to maintain our peace and resist all possible aggressions. The Italian people and the political system they have established have now become an inseparable system." (14th, Havas)</p>
<p>Turin: Italian Premier Mussolini delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the Self-Sufficiency Exhibition here today, saying that after an objective review of the current situation, he felt that there were no major or acute problems in Europe at present that were sufficient to cause a war. Our unwillingness for peace is only due to the many disasters in our internal situation. May I ask the major democracies to express fair opinions on our views? There are tens of millions of people who are asking us whether we are heading towards peace or war. This is indeed a difficult question for anyone to answer, especially for those who are responsible for deciding peace and war. There are certain knots in Europe that do not need to be untied with a knife, but must be untied immediately, because sometimes it feels better to have a war than to be trapped in difficulties and indecision for a long time. Italy and Germany now share this belief. The indomitable nature of Fascism is now even greater. We will take the same steps as Germany on all European issues to give peace to Europe with justice. Mussolini also asked sarcastically, "Can the major democracies match Italy's sincere desire for peace? We should express doubts about this, because the lack of sincerity of the democracies towards peace can be seen in the fact that they have already launched the so-called "white war" in the economic field. War is not only won by gold. We will defeat it with courage and willpower." Mussolini also said that the short-barreled system created by Versailles has failed, and it is expected that the guarantee system will also collapse. Who dares to have any doubts about the future? No matter what happens, he dares to declare that all of our goals will be achieved one by one. It is noteworthy that Mussolini's speech did not mention Danzig, Poland, the Anglo-Turkish treaty, or Italy's demands on France. (14th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the issue of amending the Covenant of the League of Nations, political figures here recently stated that the amendment plan was recently proposed by the Soviet Union and Turkey, and its content is more active than previously reported. According to this plan, the current organization of the Executive Council must be thoroughly changed. The permanent directors, who were originally held by the major powers, will in the future be held by "active" member states that accept mutual aid obligations. Other member states, who wish to strictly maintain neutrality, may also be elected as directors, but they will be elected. The distribution of these directors will still be based on geographical relations. For example, the countries of Latin America, the Balkan Consultation, and the Scandinavian Islands can each obtain these director seats. In addition, the staff departments of the "active" member states, that is, the permanent director states of the Executive Council, should also be in constant contact so that they can promptly dispatch naval, land, and air forces at the disposal of the League of Nations. In this way, when the League of Nations wants to make major decisions to implement its principles, the "neutral countries" will be powerless to delay or obstruct it. As for the detailed content of this plan, it is said that it will be formally submitted for discussion at the League of Nations General Assembly in September of this year. (14th, Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e22">Germany Says Danzig Issue Can Be Resolved Later; Germany and Italy Are Uneasy About Mutual Assistance Agreements <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The establishment of the Anglo-Turkish alliance and the ongoing Anglo-Soviet negotiations, with the aim of organizing an anti-aggression front, are now causing anxiety in Germany. Newspapers express regret that Turkey has been tempted by Britain, saying that Anglo-German understanding can only be based on a strict demarcation of areas of interest. Germany's rights over Danzig, even if they conflict with British diplomacy, must eventually be realized. The solution to this problem can be postponed, but not prevented. (14th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Diplomatic figures here recently declared that now that Britain and Turkey have decided to conclude a mutual assistance agreement and the Soviet Union's participation in the collective security system is undoubtedly confirmed, the diplomatic activities of the dictatorships are therefore limited. The German diplomatic authorities are now making every effort to urge the Nordic countries and the Baltic coast countries to conclude non-aggression pacts with them. Among the Nordic countries, only Denmark and Finland believe that it is possible to negotiate an agreement, but it must also be based on the principles recently reiterated by the meeting of foreign ministers of the Nordic countries, that is, it must be established under the conditions of absolute neutrality. As for the Baltic coast countries, Latvia and Estonia seem to be prepared to sign a non-aggression pact with Germany, the nature of which should be the same as that signed by those countries with the Soviet Union. On the contrary, Lithuania is obviously closer to Poland. In addition, although Germany and Italy have been very active in the Black Sea region, they have achieved nothing. Italy's attempts to win over Yugoslavia have also had no concrete results. Therefore, Germany and Italy may once again adopt the old method of promoting relations with countries that sympathize with the Axis policy on the one hand, and gradually expanding their influence on other countries, that is, on countries that are impartial to both the German-Italian Axis and the Anglo-French group, in terms of economics and propaganda. As for the relationship between Germany, Italy, and Japan, although Germany and Italy have decided to conclude a military treaty, the Japanese government seems to be increasingly reluctant to accept the idea of extensive military obligations. In addition, there is no sign of Germany and Italy concluding an alliance treaty with Spain, and the economic advantages that Germany can obtain in Romania have been offset by the establishment of the Anglo-Romanian commercial agreement. Germany is now still trying to win over Bulgaria and is engaged in cultural activities in Yugoslavia (there are now 500,000 Germans in Yugoslavia). This propaganda work is obviously intended to supplement the inadequacy of diplomatic activities. In short, the Axis countries, especially Germany, are engaged in vigorous diplomatic activities, but due to the active involvement of Britain and France, their scope of activities is becoming increasingly narrow. (14th, Havas) Warsaw: Polish newspapers transported to Danzig are now being confiscated again, even the official Bolska newspaper is among them. The rumor that Poland has issued a communique warning Germany that if there is a coup attempt in Danzig, Poland will resist it with force is denied by officials here, saying that no such communique has been issued in the past few days. According to news from here today, the glass windows of many Polish shops and houses in Danzig were smashed last night. Polish newspapers criticize the Danzig City Council, saying that it is taking a provocative attitude and cannot control the situation. The Bolska newspaper said that the Poles have found evidence of its malice in the attitude of the Danzig City Council, which clearly shows that the Council wants to provoke a conflict between the Poles and the residents of Danzig. (14th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The 28th of this month is the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule in the Free City of Danzig. Informed sources here commented on the rumor that the city authorities plan to hold a referendum on that day, saying that if Germany unilaterally changes the current legal status of Danzig or takes violent actions, Poland will regard it as an act of aggression and will do its best to deal with it. This is also approved by Britain and France, as can be seen from the speeches delivered by Prime Minister Chamberlain and Premier Daladier the other day. Once Danzig or any place related to the territorial integrity of Poland is indeed threatened, Poland will request assistance from Britain and France, and those countries will immediately implement the guarantee conditions. It can be asserted that the referendum planned by the authorities of the Free City of Danzig is only of a propaganda nature and is not necessarily related to the incorporation of the city into Germany. Its intention is probably to find out whether Nazism has the support of the majority of citizens, so it will not involve the current legal status of Danzig, and Poland will not need to react strongly.

<p>Kovno: According to newspaper reports, relations between the Soviet Union and the Baltic states have now been strengthened. Soviet Foreign Minister Potemkin will visit the Baltic states after the League of Nations conference, and will soon appoint a new minister to Lithuania, as Lithuania has not had a Soviet minister stationed there for more than a year. (14th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Berlin correspondent of the Sunday Times claims that one of the results of the Anglo-Turkish agreement is that Germany and Italy are enthusiastically courting Spain behind the scenes to join the Berlin-Rome Axis. Since the end of the Spanish Civil War, German writers have been writing articles exaggerating Spain's military strength and its strategic importance. However, so far, Spain has only a cultural agreement with Germany, apart from being a member of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Observers here believe that Germany and Spain will continue to sign a military alliance, and at the same time, it is expected that the economic relations between Germany and Spain will become closer due to the signing of a new commercial agreement. According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Observer, there are now various signs indicating that the Soviet Union will, without waiting for the meeting of British Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin in Geneva next week, telegraph its observations on Britain's recent proposals to London. It is said that the main driving force behind Moscow's move is the continued concern about the danger of delay. In view of the Soviet Union's eagerness to reach a compromise with Britain as soon as possible, it is said that the Soviet government will express its readiness to accept the revised method, but will reaffirm its will to insist that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must establish a firm military commitment and publicly express that it will resist any further acts of aggression by Germany. (14th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital: Turkish newspapers have published long articles praising the value of the Anglo-Turkish agreement and calling it the most important political development in some time. It also said that the government wisely abandoned its policy of neutrality and joined the democratic front because of Britain's sincerity in seeking peace. However, Turkey still intends to remain neutral and engage with other countries to protect the world's security. Now, if one considers the treatment of the Balkan neighbors by those dictatorships, which has endangered Turkey's security, then Turkey has no choice but to adopt a plan required by the environment. The Turkish people are the most loyal friends when they are on an equal footing, but they cannot tolerate being shackled by others. It concludes that the Anglo-Turkish agreement greatly enhances the confidence of the entire Balkans. (14th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources, Germany and Italy's request to sign a military alliance treaty has been rejected by Japan. The reasons are threefold: (1) Japan's main interests lie in the Far East; (2) Japan has no reason to antagonize any democratic countries; and (3) Japan maintains significant trade relations with various democratic countries. Even from an economic standpoint, it is inconvenient to sign a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<p>(Paris) A correspondent in Rome for Le Matin reports that German leader Hitler has personally drafted a treaty on political and military affairs between Germany and Italy and sent it to the Italian government via the Italian ambassador to Germany, Attolico, last night. The treaty is reportedly valid for ten years and contains eight articles, which can be revised at any time based on implementation experience within those ten years. Regarding the military aspect, the significant points include three items: (1) If war breaks out in Europe in the future, regardless of whether one of the signatory countries or a third party is involved, both governments must immediately consult with each other. The person responsible for this consultation will be determined in a separate secret protocol; (2) The interests of Germany and Italy are closely related. If war breaks out and one of the signatory countries is directly involved, the land forces of both sides will be unified under a single command and form a joint force based on a unified military strategy; (3) In future external operations, neither signatory country may independently cease hostilities without the consent of the other party, to avoid situations where a truce or peace is signed unilaterally without notification. Regarding the political aspect, in addition to reaffirming the principles of the Rome-Berlin Axis, there are two additional clauses: (1) Each signatory country shall respect the friendly relations maintained by the other party with other countries based on existing treaties or existing understandings; (2) Neither party shall sign any new agreements with external parties without mutual consultation. It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will offer his opinions on this draft as soon as he arrives in Turin. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun reports that the Ministry of Health and Welfare has decided to invoke Article 4 of the National General Mobilization Law to conscript labor to engage in businesses necessary for national mobilization. It is expected that an imperial ordinance will be promulgated by the end of June at the latest. Article 4 of the National General Mobilization Law stipulates, "When national general mobilization is necessary during wartime, the government will, in accordance with imperial ordinances, conscript imperial subjects to engage in general mobilization businesses." According to Chugai Commercial News, this ordinance aims to mobilize five million young people aged 16 to 17. These young people will serve in mobilization businesses under government control, and their wages will be the same as those earned before conscription. This plan will be handled by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan is a rice-eating country. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, there is a severe shortage of labor due to the Sino-Japanese War. Based on the recommendations of various experts, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has adopted a method of importing thousands of Korean farmers. This method is unprecedented in Japanese history. The reasons for the severe shortage of rural population in Japan are: first, many farmers have been conscripted to fight in China; second, farmers are attracted by the high wages of munitions factories, rushing to them without hesitation. At the same time, due to the extreme shortage of labor in rural areas, wages have reached a height not seen in fifty years. This can also be called a revolution in Japan's internal economy. In the past, due to the surplus of agricultural labor, farmers were often in a state of starvation. Manufacturers, also due to the surplus of labor, could arbitrarily suppress prices. As a result, farmers' children had to go to the city to work for only a few yuan, and daughters were often sold, or sold to capitalists for 300 yuan. The reason why Japanese goods could expand to the world market in the past due to the low wages and small production in Japan. Also, the manipulation of prices by Japanese speculators has been controlled by Japan. For example, the world's largest rice exchange is now completely controlled by the government, and the speculative atmosphere has been reduced. Japan's food supply relies on imports from abroad for only 1% to 2.5% each year, so people here are proud of this, believing that if a major war breaks out, Japan can return to an era of self-imposed isolation, because Japan's land can provide for itself. However, Japan's shortage of rice may increase its imports from its colonies. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's proposal to import foreign labor will greatly affect its domestic economic system, because those affected will not be limited to farmers, but also industrialists and merchants. What industrialists here are most concerned about is that this labor shortage will continue forever, because Japanese Army Minister Itagaki recently said in parliament that Japan will station troops in China indefinitely. Therefore, Japan's agricultural panic in the future may become a trigger for the gradual outbreak of many unfavorable situations in the Japanese economy. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)</p>

<p>(Bangkok) A Siamese newspaper stated, "After the outbreak of a world war, Siam must remain neutral. When neutrality is impossible, a crucial decision must be made. What shall guide us in making this important decision? That is the question. Shall we make a decision after consulting public opinion? Unfortunately, what can small countries do that are located in war zones or in strategically important areas such as Singapore, Aden, and Gibraltar? They will inevitably be forced by circumstances to help one side and be drawn into the battlefield. Although Siam wants to remain neutral, in a world war, there is no other way but to join one side or the other. If so, the point of contention is which side Siam should join? If Japan colludes with Germany and Italy, intending to destroy Singapore and control the entire Far East, Siam's assistance will be needed by Japan. Some observers believe that if the difficulties that Siam envisions within the colonial empires of England and France in alliance with Italy and Japan do not materialize, wouldn't Siam be in an unpleasant position? Today, Siam's position is truly difficult. Siam has British Burma to the west, French Vietnam to the east, and British Malaya to the south. In recent years, Japan has been very attentive to Siam, but since the Japanese invasion of China, Siam has become suspicious of Japan. Therefore, it is generally believed that England's influence in Siam is as strong as ever. Siam spends a great deal on national defense. Although its army, navy, and air force are small in size and quality, they should not be underestimated in a major war." (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>

The New York Evening Post recently published a dispatch from a Washington correspondent stating that the Army and Navy will allocate $30 million to establish a strong naval and air force base in the Caribbean Sea. The detailed plan is being studied by the authorities and is reportedly to be implemented by Rear Admiral Leahy in the future. According to this plan, if the Panama Canal Zone is invaded by a certain European country, the United States can use destroyers and bombers with extremely long ranges to fly from the Caribbean Sea base to provide support.

<p>(New York) Regarding the air force expansion plan, the New York Times recently reported that the chairman of the Joint Committee, the Director of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, Lee Ang, has submitted the first report to President Roosevelt. In addition to describing the current situation, he also stated that the United States should possess the world's strongest air force. The current number of workers employed by American aircraft manufacturers is 40,000, and this number should be increased to 60,000 in order to complete the Air Force Expansion Act (the main point of which is to allocate $37.6 million to build 3,532 aircraft, thereby increasing the total number of Army aircraft to 6,000) on schedule. The report also outlined various measures to enable factories to train a large number of workers effectively to meet wartime needs. It is also understood that the committee will submit a second report explaining "Continental Defense" and the government's subsidization of the development of various civil aviation routes.

<p>(London) Bulgaria is greatly angered after receiving news that Romanian gendarmes killed 23 Bulgarians on the southern border of Blagoevgrad. According to the Romanian side, some Bulgarians crossed the border and attacked Romanian villages, so they were detained by Romanian gendarmes. When they were passing through a forest, gunshots were suddenly heard. The Romanian gendarmes believed that Bulgarian soldiers were attacking, so they opened fire in self-defense, killing 23 Bulgarians. The Romanian embassy in Bulgaria is now being guarded by troops to prevent demonstrations. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Athens) Last night, the Greek government mobilized troops because the border conflict between the Greek and Bulgarian armies had become more serious. It is reported that as a result of the conflict, 14 Greek soldiers were killed and 14 were injured. Previously, the Bulgarian army had attacked two Greek defense positions, resulting in the deaths of one Greek officer and three soldiers, and the injury of five Greek soldiers. Subsequently, the Greek army waited for reinforcements and counterattacked, capturing one Bulgarian army position and killing 10 Bulgarian soldiers and wounding 9. Because the conflict became more serious, the Greek government has called up officers and technicians from 1928 and 1934. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)</p>

<p>(Dunkirk, Northern France) A gorilla escaped here recently, though it was soon captured, but residents were greatly alarmed. A German cargo ship, loaded with various animals such as rhinos, elephants, hippos, giraffes, and gorillas from Africa, was en route to the Hamburg Zoo. It made a short stop in this port, and just as it was about to set sail, it was discovered that a gorilla had escaped from its cage and fled ashore. As a result, many sailors from the ship, armed with knives, spears, or strong ropes, searched everywhere. At the same time, customs officials also patrolled the streets with weapons. Residents heard the news and closed their doors and stayed inside. The gorilla was found in a tavern, heavily intoxicated. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<p>(Budapest, Hungary) Foreign Minister Csáky recently gave a speech in Sopron, discussing the European situation in general terms, saying, "I believe that the countries we can rely on as allies are primarily the Axis powers, and certainly Poland. We hope that Poland will be strong and will seek 'peace' in a wise and honorable manner. Our country's territorial integrity must be guaranteed, and we will not hesitate to use force if necessary. It goes without saying that 'Germany is peaceful towards our country and recognizes the inviolability of our current borders.' In addition, we hope to establish friendly relations with Yugoslavia and ease relations with Romania, thereby seeking understanding with patience and perseverance. Although we share the same interests as the Axis powers, we also wish to establish cultural and economic ties with Western European countries.

<h3 id="e37">Italy Stations Heavy Troops in North Africa; Has 200 Airplanes <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Military sources here recently stated that Italy has stationed a large number of troops in its Libyan territory in North Africa, with three main targets: French Tunisia and southern Africa. These troops include troops from Italy itself, locally recruited native troops, native troops from Italian Eritrea in East Africa, and a small number of motorized units, totaling no less than 100,000 men. In addition, there is an air force with 200 airplanes. However, France has also taken various military measures in Tunisia, building strong fortifications in the border area. If Italy intends to attack there, it will not be easy, so it may not be attempted lightly. This is one reason. Egypt can be said to be completely undefended, and the military strength stationed there is very weak. However, if Italy blindly advances there, France will inevitably enter Libya from Tunisia, taking advantage of the situation. Since Libya is an important base for Italian troops in Africa, Italy would not risk leaving itself vulnerable. This is another reason. As for Italy's attack on southern Africa, although there are many technical difficulties, it is not impossible, because Italy can use Lake Chad in southern Abyssinia to extend its influence.

<p>(Stockholm, Sweden) The government's proposal to increase the number of army personnel, the main points of which are to call up reservists from the 1936 class and organize air defense teams in all important cities throughout the country, has been discussed and voted on by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate recently passed it by a vote of 87 to 37, and the House of Representatives passed it by a vote of 138 to 39. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Stockholm, Sweden) In order to strengthen national defense, the government submitted a bill to the House of Representatives proposing that: The annual service period for naval officers and soldiers should be increased from 200 days to 340 days; special security teams should be formed in the infantry; air defense teams should be formed in all important cities throughout the country; reservists from the 1936 class should be called up for service. After deliberation, the House of Representatives National Defense Committee generally agreed with this plan, but argued that reservists from the 1934 class should also be called up for service. On the conservative side, however, they felt that the various measures proposed by the government were of no help, and therefore proposed a motion to call up seven classes of reservists at the same time. The House of Representatives put the party's motion to a vote today and immediately rejected it. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>

<p>(Los Angeles) Bodin, the husband of the deceased American female pilot Amelia Earhart, is a famous publisher. He recently published the book "The Man Who Killed Hitler." Not long after its release, he received a threatening letter signed by a National Socialist Party member from Los Angeles, stating that if he did not immediately stop publishing, he would be shot. Yesterday, he was suddenly kidnapped by two people in his garage, put in a car, and driven to a remote place 100 kilometers outside the city. They forced him to reveal the name of the author of the book. Bodin insisted that he did not know the author and could not tell them. The two then left in frustration. Because Bodin's hands and feet were tied, he could not move until he was discovered this morning and released. According to Bodin, the kidnappers spoke German but did not mistreat him.

<h3 id="e40">Japanese Troops in Hankou Discriminate Against British and American Nationals' Commercial Activities; All Foreign Activities Suspended; British and American Merchants' Properties Also Occupied <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports: A certain foreign merchant, formerly residing in Hankou and visiting Shanghai, yesterday (the 13th) recounted to reporters the current situation in Hankou eight months after its fall. He said that Hankou is now completely strangled; merchants are unable to engage in trade. The foreign merchant cited numerous instances of the Japanese side discriminating against foreign shops in the port, stating that the result is the complete suspension of all trade. However, there are many Japanese goods stored in the city. The Japanese side's discrimination is all-encompassing; therefore, there is no foreign trade in Hankou. Although some foreign goods are transported to Hankou, they are all carried by Japanese ships and handled by Japanese merchants. The entire urban area of Hankou is under Japanese control. As for the Chinese shops in the area, they have negotiated with the Japanese side and obtain goods from them, making substantial profits. The Japanese side controls all shipping in the area, closing the Yangtze River and prohibiting foreign ships from sailing. On his way downriver to Shanghai, he saw few ships on the Yangtze, but this situation varies from time to time because those that do sail are all carrying Japanese goods, leading to an overstock of Japanese goods in Hankou. The Japanese claim that all goods are military necessities is not credible, and the Japanese no longer make this claim in Hankou. When asked by the reporter whether it was true, as the Japanese side claimed, that there were a million Japanese soldiers in the Yangtze River region, the foreign merchant said he did not believe it. Only Jiujiang, Wuhu, and other places in the area have military activity. The main characteristic of the Yangtze River now is that there is no trade at all, and no houses are being rebuilt. The foreign merchant relayed the situation in Hankou itself, saying that residents cannot move without the permission of the Japanese authorities. Foreigners are often asked to show identification. A curfew is in effect from 11 p.m. every night. Foreigners must obtain permission to move goods, and this permission often takes three or four days to obtain. The supply of electricity for lighting is a clear example of Japanese discrimination. For example, British people on property owned by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. are not supplied with electricity, while Germans in the same area are. The Japanese in Hankou habitually occupy foreign property. They seize everything they consider to belong to the Chinese. If it suits their purposes, they occupy the property and do not leave. The Japanese believe that only they can decide whether property belongs to the Chinese. There have been many such cases to date. There have also been cases where British property has been occupied by the Japanese because it is managed or occupied by Chinese. The restrictions in the French Concession in Hankou have been relaxed, so entry and exit are easier than before. The supply of food has also gradually returned to normal, but there are still some restrictions that are quite inconvenient. Only the reopening of the Yangtze River can restore foreign trade in Hankou, but there is little hope of this, and there is no hope of removing all the restrictions that hinder trade. Unless these two things are done, there will be no foreign trade in Hankou. The police affairs of the Third Special District of Hankou (formerly the British Concession) are now managed by the Japanese, so the area is effectively under Japanese control. The Japanese are inclined to disregard the people of third countries, resulting in the infringement of foreign property, and the actual occupation will never end. The foreign merchant believes that the blockade of the Yangtze River is not militarily necessary but is a pretext for the Japanese to attempt to dominate trade. If this continues, foreign trade will be completely eliminated. This situation is closely linked to the situation in Europe. Britain is currently busy dealing with its domestic problems and does not interfere with others. Only the United States can deter Japan's monopoly of trade by implementing threats. The foreign merchant concluded by saying that there are no convenient travel arrangements today. Many people have been stranded in Hankou for months. The Japanese side's attitude towards navigation in the Yangtze River is clearly not benevolent. For example, missionaries can obtain permission to travel on the Yangtze River, but merchants cannot. Most debaters travel on British and American gunboats, but they must be escorted by Japanese warships. He believes that this is not necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Eight Japanese Planes Bomb Shantou with Increasing Ferocity; Bombing Continues Non-Stop on the 5th, 6th and 7th; U.S. Consulate in Shantou Nearly Hit; Major Buildings Flattened <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Japanese planes carried out a large-scale bombing raid on Shantou on the 3rd and 4th, as reported in previous telegrams. It has now been confirmed that the bombs dropped on the 4th destroyed more than forty warehouses and civilian houses on Tongji Road, the entire Guanghua埠 match factory, and also bombed a garlic factory, killing more than a hundred people. The disaster area is vast, with more than a hundred houses destroyed. Many corpses have not been dug out, or the corpses have been blown to pieces, so the exact number cannot be counted. At 9 a.m. on the 5th, eight more Japanese planes flew into the city and dropped twenty-four bombs, which landed in Zhongshan Road, Gui Fu Li, Xin Mei Li, Xin Jian Li, Hui Lan Bridge, and the Qi Lu area, destroying 120 houses and killing or injuring 150 people.</p>
<p>Four Bombs Also Land Near British Warship</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. on the morning of the 6th, eight Japanese planes again flew to Qi Lu in the city and dropped bombs. The bombs landed about 400 feet from the U.S. Consulate. On the west embankment of Qi Lu, there was a British warship, which was intended to protect the foreign firms, but the Japanese planes disregarded it, flew low over the warship and dropped bombs. Four bombs also landed near the British warship, splashing water tens of feet high and creating huge waves. Four or five boats capsized on the embankment, drowning more than ten people. Foreigners were very angry. At the most critical moment, the British warship fired warning shots into the air, and the Japanese planes left. The Qi Lu Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Huang Family Ancestral Hall on Zhongshan Road, Da Zhong, Yi Zhong, and more than twenty nearby civilian houses were all destroyed. The factories and warehouses on Hui Lan Bridge, Tongji Road, Guanghua埠, and Wu Bridge Bank were also reduced to rubble. In the central area of Wai Ma Road, the bombs landed more than ten feet deep in Guangtian Right and Left Lanes, Hua Ming Road, and Zhongshan Park, turning the ground into a honeycomb pattern. More than 400 people were killed or injured. The Chao'an Railway Station, tracks, and power plant were hit by sixteen bombs and blown to pieces. All the machinery and industry in the Jieyang Qu Xi pond factory and grain factory were destroyed. The leper colony on the isolated island of Cao Yu was the most severely bombed, killing more than forty patients. Nan'ao, Long'ao, Raoping, and Zhao'an were also bombed. On Mount Jiaoshi in Shantou, there are two or three thousand people seeking refuge every day, squatting on the rocks. On the 7th, the Japanese warship stationed in Shantou moved to Xiamen, but in the afternoon of the same day, it still sent two planes to Shantou to drop bombs on Jiaoshi, killing fifteen people. Only six people were rescued. Most pitifully, an electric boat carrying refugees to Jieyang on the evening of the 6th collided with a sailboat on the way because it was sailing in the dark and sank, drowning more than 200 passengers. Only a dozen people were rescued. Also, a ferry returning to Shantou from Jiaoshi was sunk by the wind on the way, killing dozens of people. If the Japanese planes had not bombed Shantou, there would have been no such accidental disasters. On the 7th, a conspiracy agency was uncovered in Shantou, and a leader from Taiwan was arrested in a large hotel, along with more than a dozen men and women. When the planes were bombing that day, these people were pointing out targets and were very active. More people were arrested on the 8th and are currently being interrogated.</p>
<p>Shantou City is Extremely Desolate</p>
<p>At present, after the Japanese planes' frantic bombing, the entire city of Shantou has become a disaster area. All the larger factories, shops, and buildings have been razed to the ground, blood and flesh are blurred, the stench is pungent, flies are swarming, and birds are silent. A large number of residents in the city have been evacuated to the interior. Armed teams remain in the suburbs, preparing to fight. Zhang Fakui commissioned Liu Zhilu to organize the Chaozhou and Shantou strong men, limited to one month to complete the organization, to assist the military in combat. Liu arrived in Shantou on the 2nd to carry out all the preparatory work. There are only 40,000 to 50,000 people remaining in Shantou, equal to a quarter of the pre-war population. The goods in the shops could not be moved in a hurry. During the day, the shop doors are locked (or one or two people are left to guard the shop), and rice and charcoal are carried across the sea to Mount Jiaoshi for refuge. At night, they return to Shantou to open the doors for business, pack up the goods and transport them away, or sell them off cheaply in order to end their business. Boats and vehicles travel more at night, and people fleeing never stop all night. During the day, they disperse and hide, and no one is seen in the streets and alleys. The foreign firms have also all stopped operations. Most foreigners have moved to Mount Jiaoshi. Two bombs landed on the Qi Lu Zhonghe Foreign Firm, seriously injuring an American. Six Texaco oil depots on Hui Wan Bridge were all bombed and collapsed. Taikoo, Jardine, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Imperial Chemical Industries, and HSBC, on the west embankment, made canvas flags several feet in size and covered them on the tiles, thinking that it would be safe according to foreign psychology. Unexpectedly, Japanese planes flew into the city and dropped more than ten bombs, followed by shooting. The planes flew as low as 500 feet, strafing back and forth, without any regard. Therefore, the foreign firms also suffered.</p>

<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Japanese secret service agencies in various places in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan are instigating puppet organizations to force the people to hold anti-British movements, launch anti-British propaganda parades, and form permanent anti-British groups, with the principle of resisting British goods and overthrowing British imperialism as the propaganda principle. Recently, the Japanese puppets will further implement a radical anti-British movement, suspected of searching for British goods in various occupied areas and destroying them. For example, the Japanese army in Anqing and Bengbu has burned more than a thousand boxes of Great Britain brand cigarettes and is preparing to expel British merchants and missionaries from the country. It is heard that after the anti-British movement is successful, the Japanese puppets will prepare to promote anti-Americanism in order to create an atmosphere of confrontation with the anti-aggression line. The Xuzhou Japanese secret service agency, with the successive holding of anti-British movements in central China and other places, especially on the afternoon of the 23rd of last month at 1 p.m., instigated the puppet organization to force the people to hold the Xuzhou people's anti-British movement conference in the Chenghuang Temple on Public Security Street. Li Yangzhou was the chairman, and there was a parade and demonstration. Those who attended the meeting included various puppet agencies and schools. At that time, resolutions and telegrams were passed, and anti-British songs were sung and slogans were shouted. The lyrics were, "The Sino-Japanese war broke out last year, and the British instigated it as the source of the disaster. Miserable, miserable, the British again want to take advantage of the situation. White people are related to each other. In the Opium War, we paid reparations, ceded land, and opened ports at the forefront. The British are cunning, and we must strengthen the anti-British front. We swear not to let the treacherous British invade the Central Plains." The slogans were, "Sino-Japanese friendship, oppose European and American aid to China to prolong the war and destroy East Asian peace."</p>

<h3 id="e45">Overview of Frontier Education; Frontier Education Funding Continues to Increase; Many Frontier Education Facilities Promoted <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing) Since the Ministry of Education established the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department in 1930, it has been actively engaged in frontier education, and it has achieved considerable results. Here is a summary of its main points:</p>
<p>Frontier Education Funding</p>
<p>Regarding the planning and distribution of frontier education funds, the Ministry of Education and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission discussed it several times in 1931, 1932, and 1933 and promoted the frontier education plan. In the end, the annual budget of only 50,000 yuan was used by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to subsidize several schools in the border areas that had excellent results, subsidize border students to study, and moderately subsidize border cultural groups. There were no remaining funds available for distribution, and the proposed plans could not be realized. The Ministry of Education, in view of the complexity of the frontier problem, if it does not urgently seek to establish a cultural foundation, political and educational construction may not be able to proceed. In 1935, it designated 500,000 yuan from the funds to subsidize remote and poor provinces for the purpose of running frontier education. In 1937, it increased to 640,000 yuan, designating six uses: (1) subsidizing schools with excellent results; (2) training teachers; (3) increasing the number of primary schools; (4) increasing the number of social education agencies; (5) subsidizing border students to study; (6) compiling and printing teaching materials.</p>
<p>School Education</p>
<p>The frontier schools subsidized by the Ministry of Education include one class of Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui teacher training classes attached to the Lanzhou Xiangshi in Gansu Province, 55 primary schools, one Mongolian and Tibetan simple teacher school in Xining, Qinghai Province, two middle schools, 143 primary schools, two Mongolian Banner Normal Classes in Ningxia Province, 14 primary schools, one Kangding Simple Normal School in Xikang Province, five primary schools, three Yunnan Provincial Border Simple Normal Schools (reported as ten, but no detailed report has been received by the department, so only those that have been reported are listed), 35 primary schools, one Guiyang Xiangshi School in Guizhou Province, 12 primary schools, two Pingshan and Maoxian Simple Normal Schools in Sichuan Province, 15 primary schools, one teacher training class in the Xiangxi Special Zone in Hunan Province, 100 short-term primary schools, five Mongolian and Hui normal classes attached to the Dihua Normal School in Xinjiang Province, and one Aksu Simple Normal School, 1,412 primary schools, one National Suiyuan Mongolian Banner Normal School in Suiyuan Province, one Mongolian Banner Middle School subsidized in Tumote Banner, 29 primary schools, 13 Mongolian Banner primary schools in Chahar Province (Chahar is currently completely suspended, and there are four primary schools in Suiyuan that continue to open), one Guangxi Provincial Special Teacher Training Institute, 541 primary schools, and one Lhasa Municipal First Primary School in Tibet. A total of 12 normal schools and 9 classes, 3 middle schools, and 3,374 primary schools.</p>
<p>Social Education</p>
<p>The social education agencies subsidized by the Ministry of Education include one Mongolian Banner Education Mobile Work Team in Ningxia Province, one Mobile Education Team of the Lhasa Tibetan Cultural Promotion Association, one Mongolian Cultural Center (which has been discontinued), one Second Mobile Social Education Center in Chahar Province (which has been discontinued), and one Mongolian Translation Center established by the twelve banners of Chahar Province (which has been discontinued).</p>
<p>Temple Education</p>
<p>In order to improve temple education, the Ministry of Education, together with the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, issued a circular to the education halls of various border provinces and the Mongolian and Tibetan local governments, urging the local temples to establish public schools or supplementary schools for the nearby people and monks to study. The mosques of the Hui religion were also instructed to add subjects such as national language common sense and arithmetic to the Awen schools. In addition, the time for lecturing on scriptures in various temples was used to give lectures on spiritual lectures and literacy movements, and methods were devised to train lamas, monks, and ahongs.</p>
<p>Student Preference</p>
<p>In order to encourage Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui students to enter specialty schools and above in the interior, the Ministry of Education allocated special funds for subsidies from 1936, subsidizing 300 yuan per person per year. In addition, travel expenses were also issued as appropriate, with an average of dozens of people subsidized each year.</p>
<p>Cultural Lectures</p>
<p>In order to communicate Han and Tibetan culture, the Ministry of Education added Tibetan cultural lectures at five universities, including Central, Tsinghua, Wuhan, Sun Yat-sen, and Beijing, in 1937, and specially hired Tibetan Geshe Xirao Jiacuo as the lecturer.</p>
<p>Compilation of Teaching Materials</p>
<p>The situation in the border areas is special, and the languages are different, so ordinary teaching materials cannot be applied. The Ministry of Education separately compiled, printed, and distributed applications. The teaching materials that have now been compiled include "Han-Mongolian Bilingual" textbooks, eight volumes of national language for primary schools, four volumes of common sense, a thousand-character textbook on the Three Principles of the People, a volume of short-term primary school textbooks, "Han-Tibetan Bilingual" textbooks, four volumes of national language for primary schools, a volume of textbooks for public schools, and three volumes of "Han-Hui Bilingual" primary school textbooks. In addition, eight volumes of Han-Tibetan bilingual textbooks submitted by Xikang and five volumes of Han-Tibetan reading materials submitted by the Han-Tibetan Buddhist Academy have been reviewed and finalized, but the content is not perfect and is currently being revised.</p>
<p>Improvements</p>
<p>(1) "Expansion of the Scope of Frontier Education Facilities." The population in the border areas is complex, the culture is backward, and the conditions in various places are different. Not only the Mongolian and Tibetan areas must adapt to the environment to implement education, but also the Hui people in Xinjiang, the Tibetan in Qinghai, and various ethnic groups in the southwestern border areas, whose languages and customs are very different from those in the interior. We should implement education according to their actual needs so that it is easier to achieve results. Therefore, the scope of work of the Mongolian and Tibetan Department of the Ministry of Education has spread to various places in the border areas. (2) "Correction of the Name of Mixed Education." The purpose of frontier education is the integration of national culture. If different names are established and characteristics are marked, it is tantamount to dispersing the entire Chinese nation. If students of various ethnic groups are taught separately, their feelings cannot be connected. Therefore, the Ministry of Education issued a circular to various schools in the border areas, requiring them to use place names as school names, recruit students, regardless of ethnicity, and mix education in order to eliminate the boundaries between various ethnic groups. (3) "Taking the National Language as the Center of Education." The main reason for the emotional barriers between ethnic minorities is the difference in language. Therefore, the first task of frontier education must be to enable the people in the border areas to understand the national language and national language, so that unnecessary barriers can be eliminated invisibly. (4) "Frontier Education Undertakings" are gradually being changed from subsidy methods to direct management by the central government. Due to the lack of political order in various parts of the frontier, there are many obstacles to the implementation of frontier education. Therefore, the Ministry of Education is trying to reorganize the original educational institutions and continue to provide subsidies, while gradually establishing national model schools to control teachers, establishing experimental primary schools to guide local education, establishing national middle schools to absorb young people, establishing vocational schools in the border areas to train construction talents, and establishing frontier schools as the center for research and promotion of education in various regions. In this way, frontier education undertakings can be gradually controlled by the central government so that they can proceed smoothly under a certain plan and policy.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Hong Kong Education Should Be Avoided; Improving Chinese Education; Establishing Specialized Schools to Train Teachers; Education Funding Increases Monthly <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Chinese education in Hong Kong has many shortcomings due to its special environment, and it is completely disconnected from the domestic education system. In recent years, Chinese and foreign educators have criticized this. The Hong Kong education authorities, in view of this, are eager to improve it. They have considered the issues of teachers, funding, and the education system and have formulated improvement measures. Part of the plan has been implemented, and the rest can also be implemented in the short term. Here is a record of the situation:</p>
<p>Improving Shortcomings</p>
<p>The unsoundness of the Hong Kong education system has been pointed out by Chinese and foreign educators for many years. Its obvious shortcomings include the following: (1) English schools focus too much on general education and neglect vocational education. In addition to those who go to the University of Hong Kong and domestic universities, the graduates of middle schools go to government agencies and foreign firms, and very few enter other professions. The reason is that there is a lack of vocational training. (2) In terms of Chinese schools, the curriculum and graduation level are not connected with those of domestic schools, especially in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. There are many middle schools in Hong Kong without physics and chemistry laboratories, and there are also many that do not include physics and chemistry in the curriculum. After graduation, students who go to the University of Hong Kong have difficulty being admitted due to their English level, and it is not easy to go to school in China, and employment is even more bleak. (3) The unsoundness of education in Hong Kong and poor teachers are one of the main reasons. Improving teachers must start with teacher training. The authorities have also recognized the shortcomings of education in Hong Kong in recent years and it is necessary to improve it. Special education experts have been commissioned to take charge of it. The current Director of Education, Sulis, is a well-known education expert. According to the past education directors in Hong Kong, they were all promoted and appointed by educators. Only Su was transferred from elsewhere, which shows the attention of the authorities to improving education in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Training Teachers</p>
<p>The change in the beginning of the school year has been implemented years ago to connect it with domestic schools. Currently, schools in Hong Kong have changed from starting in the spring to starting in the fall. In addition, the biggest measure of the education authorities is to improve the quality of teachers. The teacher training school run by the Education Department is scheduled to start classes in September. The school site has been selected at the old National Hospital, and repairs are currently underway. Classes will be taught in Chinese and English, with a two-year training period. After graduation, they will be sent to various public and private schools to teach.</p>
<p>Increased Funding</p>
<p>As for the original Chinese Women's Normal School of the Education Department, most of its graduates have served in the education sector. In order to encourage schools to employ graduates of the school, the education authorities have stipulated the level of subsidies for schools, which is determined by the number of graduates employed by the school. Those who employ four or more people are top-level subsidized schools, those who employ two people are third-level subsidized schools, and those who employ one person are fourth-level subsidized schools. The Education Department has greatly increased its funding due to the various improvement projects carried out in recent years. The monthly expenditure exceeds 100,000 yuan, and last month it reached 438,306 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Shanghai Foreign Football Club Sends Letter to Hong Kong: Resuming the Shanghai-Hong Kong Port Competition <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Newsletter) The Shanghai Foreign Football Club recently sent a letter to Hong Kong requesting the resumption of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Port Competition. The reason is that although the Chinese area of Shanghai has fallen, the concessions have not been affected in any way. If Chinese players are unwilling to go to Shanghai, the Hong Kong Football Association is requested to persuade them. However, according to general observations, the Hong Kong side will decide whether to reply based on how the overall situation at the end of the year will develop. The Shanghai Football Club has been greatly affected by the lack of a Hong Kong-Shanghai Port Competition this year in terms of funding, hence this request.</p>

<h3 id="e60">The Rice Market is Superficially Stable, but Underground Transactions Remain Intense; The Market Management Committee Strictly Investigates and Stipulates Rewards for Reporting Information; Expecting the Concession Authorities to Properly Plan Methods <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Since Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places have prohibited the export of rice, general hoarders are taking advantage of this time of year when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet available, attempting to monopolize the market, causing market chaos, and underground transactions have revived. After emergency measures were taken by the rice industry organizations, yesterday the market was gradually stabilized, and prices fell back and tended to be stable. The rice industry is waiting for the concession authorities to quickly develop appropriate methods. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hoarders Monopolize and the Market is Chaotic</p>
<p>After the Bean and Rice Industry Market Management Committee strictly implemented price limits and banned illegal underground transactions, the market price finally stabilized, and underground transactions disappeared. Recently, Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places have prohibited the export of rice, so general hoarders took the opportunity to monopolize and attempt to make huge profits. The situation in the market is tense, and underground transactions have revived. The top-grade white rice has exceeded 16 yuan, and the price of other grades of rice has either exceeded the price limit or reached the top price, and the situation is chaotic and serious. The retail price of top-grade white rice at rice shops has risen to 16.2 yuan, and the price of second-grade rice has also exceeded the limit of 15 yuan. If this continues, it will have a huge impact on the entire Shanghai food supply.</p>
<p>Stipulating Rewards for Reporting Information</p>
<p>Rice industry organizations such as the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Association held an informal meeting the night before last to strictly ban underground transactions in the market and strictly implement price limits to maintain the Shanghai food supply. In addition to re-promulgating strict enforcement and punishment, they also hope that anyone will report any information at any time. If there is no material evidence, but there are indeed factual witnesses, once verified, punishment will be imposed, and the reporter will be rewarded with 30% of the fine. For example, if it is verified that the buyer, seller, and intermediary each receive a fine of 100 yuan, then the reward will be 30 yuan in total, aiming to reward anyone who reports information.</p>
<p>Ordering the Management Committee to Strictly Investigate</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association has ordered all 19 members of the Market Management Committee, including Fu Qian'geng, Wang Tianqiu, and Gu Yisheng, to strictly investigate improper transactions in the market, strictly implement price limits, and impose strict penalties according to law. In addition, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inspected the market yesterday morning and found that the chaotic situation was slightly better than the day before, the people's hearts were gradually stabilized, and prices fell back. However, the total number of transactions concluded according to the price limit was only more than 5,000 bags. As for underground transactions, they remained the same, but the traders were all sneaky because they were afraid of being reported and punished by the Market Management Committee.</p>
<p>Seven Rice Inventory Surveys Have Been Completed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession's rice inventory, according to the sixth survey report of the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee on May 6, was 567,138 bags. As for the seventh rice inventory survey, it was completed yesterday and is being organized. It is expected to be formally released today. It is reported that the total number is 563,000 bags, a decrease of about 3,000 bags from the previous week. As for the rice transported to Shanghai from the producing areas in recent days, there were about 2,000 bags on the 13th and about 2,500 bags on the 14th. At this time when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet available, the scarcity of rice is a phenomenon that occurs every year, but the soaring price of rice is indeed unexpected.</p>
<p>Waiting for the Authorities to Properly Plan Methods</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the rice industry organizations yesterday that the methods recommended by the rice industry to the concession authorities to regulate the Shanghai food supply are: (1) to prepare for the future and order foreign rice to provide relief; (2) to dredge the source of production areas to maintain the Shanghai food supply. It is reported that the concession authorities have handed it over to the Rice and Grain Joint Management Committee for research. Now, the rice industry organizations are waiting for the concession authorities to develop a proper plan. Since the production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have fallen into war zones, they have been repeatedly illegally obstructed by the Japanese, resulting in many obstacles to the transportation of domestic rice. Now, the power to dredge the source is beyond the reach of the rice industry organizations, so please ask the concession authorities to find a way to dredge it.</p>
<p>Hoarders Refuse to Register Rice Inventory</p>
<p>Regarding the source of rice and grain, if it is unfortunately cut off, it will directly affect the food supply of millions of people and indirectly affect the security of the two concessions. As for ordering foreign rice, at the current price, Saigon is 198 catties per bag, which is equivalent to 20 yuan in national currency, then 160 catties per stone is equivalent to 16 yuan in national currency. The Shanghai Jianghai Customs has long exempted the import of foreign rice from taxes since the war. In addition, the association's rice inventory registration has been held from the 12th to the 18th of this month, but general hoarders are waiting and watching and refusing to register, so there are no results to speak of. Now, the association has decided to report to the concession authorities for instructions on effective methods.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Can Europe Avoid War? The Views of Foreigners in Shanghai; French Pessimists Believe War is Inevitable; Germans and Italians Say Peaceful Resolution is Hoped for; Americans Say America Will Not Participate <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>—Translated from Sunday Mercury—</p>
<p>Most foreigners in this city do not believe that a European war is imminent. At least one Frenchman feels that war is inevitable sooner or later. One Italian believes that the elements of war are more likely to occur than not. However, one German believes that all problems can eventually find a peaceful resolution. Those who do not believe that war is about to come think that hope may be the mother of thought. However, the American community dares to decide that the United States will not participate in the war. Because the European crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, the reporter asked the opinions of the expatriates of several countries most related to the European situation. The compilation is as follows, which I think those who care about the current situation will be happy to hear.</p>
<p>Germany is Willing to Live in Peace with France</p>
<p>Dr. William, a German lawyer, said: "I don't believe that war is imminent. Germany has a peace-loving leader and does not want to resort to force. I recently traveled to Europe and felt that only Germany did not talk about war among the countries. People in other countries all said that Germany did not heed the opinions of various countries and newspapers. It is very foolish to say this. You must know that Germany is not like that. Germany always wants to live in peace with its neighbors. Leader Hitler recently made a special statement that Germany is willing to live in peace with France. Germany is not shaken by the fact that British newspapers are talking about war. Germany does not want any territory from Britain. I think the Polish problem may be resolved peacefully. I believe that Poland and other countries can understand. If Germany is separated by a corridor to another country, and Germany is not given the convenience of transportation, this is unreasonable. The leader once said in a certain speech that the National Socialist Party Congress in September this year will be called the 'Peace Congress.' This is very noteworthy."</p>
<p>The Situation in Italy is Different Now</p>
<p>An Italian named Lichini of the China-Italy Shipping Company said: "There are two opportunities to hope to save the European war: (1) The so-called democratic front is in harmony with the Axis powers; (2) The front is powerful enough to scare Berlin and Rome. Then the latter may be difficult to achieve. Germany and Italy will fight for their rights. Italy has not forgotten that it was betrayed by Britain and France when negotiating peace after the last European war. Britain and France encompassed everything, while Italy gained nothing. Hungry people will not choose food and must fight for it. Now there is one thing that can be decided. Germany and Italy will never be satisfied with what they have now. The Italian people are now being injected with propaganda every day, making them know that Italy's national power is strong. The authorities rarely talk about the lack of money, and they have not paid attention to the fact that in the new era of war, the economy is more important than weapons. The situation today is certainly far less bad than in 1935. At that time, the British fleet sailed into the Mediterranean Sea to deal with the Italian fleet. The Italian fleet's military supplies were only enough for six hours of fighting. Today, the Italian army and navy have sufficient military supplies."</p>
<p>Japanese Thoughts Focus on Britain</p>
<p>Shibata, a Japanese reporter for the Allied News Agency, said: "I think the chances of the European war realizing and disappearing each account for half. Britain has many concerns about the war. One is that if the European war breaks out, Japan will take the opportunity to seize the interests of the British in the Far East. Second, Britain wants to maintain the balance and the current situation, and wants to determine the results of the German, Italian, and Japanese anti-communist alliance, so that it can speak. Therefore, it will not launch at least at present. In short, Britain is now taking a wait-and-see attitude. Most of its attention will undoubtedly be on the possibility of Britain as a mediator to form a Chinese-Japanese peace, because this move can place Japan in a disadvantaged position to participate in the European war on a large scale. Britain believes that if so, it can proceed to establish a democratic front. The overall situation is very subtle now. Who dares to decide whether the European war is about to happen or not? Because any event can affect the balance."</p>
<p>French Businessmen Observe that War is Inevitable</p>
<p>The import manager of a Parisian commercial bank that runs world trade said: "In my view, the European war is inevitable. It will either happen in the near future, or it will happen some time from now, or it will even happen tomorrow. But I dare to decide that it will eventually happen. I think all negotiations will not only be insufficient to cure the disease, but will also increase it. The only hope is that the democratic car line is stronger than the Berlin-Rome axis. I am afraid that even so, it cannot eliminate the war. A letter from my Paris head office said, "Although the war will not happen immediately, we must prepare for the worst." Therefore, orders for goods sold to China that are immediately delivered can still be accepted in France. Orders for long-term delivery must be rejected, in case of war, the port is blocked, or the ship is sunk, and the goods are confiscated. "Since the summer of 1914, Europe has never been so worried about war as it is today. When the Czech crisis occurred in September last year, my commercial bank still accepted long-term orders and took risks, but today I dare not. "This has caused great damage to businesses that ship goods from Europe to Shanghai. Since the import of textiles has increased sharply after the Chinese factory was destroyed by artillery fire, it would be great if we could accept long-term orders."</p>
<p>Democratic Countries Can Eliminate European War</p>
<p>A British securities broker who recently traveled to Europe and returned to Shanghai said: "I think the sudden strengthening of the attitude of democratic countries is enough to eliminate the European war. Today, gunpowder is scattered all over Europe, and a spark can easily make it a prairie fire. But I think Hitler and Mussolini now need to use safety matches and plan to continue to do this prevention. They would rather negotiate than take the risk of starting a war in the hope of luck. If they lose first, they will lose everything they have today. I think Germany has signed an agreement with Romania, so it can obtain the benefits that it can get from recovering its old colonies, such as oil and wheat products, which can be obtained at will without paying for travel expenses and maintaining maritime navigation. The tension in Europe is not something that can be relaxed for a while, but I believe that war will not happen."</p>
<p>Mussolini's Wisdom Will Not Seek War</p>
<p>Ross, the secretary of the American Navy Youth Association, said: "In my personal opinion, there will be no war in Europe. European politicians know the meaning of war, and Mussolini is the most. Mussolini is so smart and so patriotic that he will not bear to let Italy fall into destruction. During the last European war, I served in the Italian Youth Association for a long time and gained a lot of experience. I know Mussolini very well, but I know very little about Hitler. However, I think Hitler will not be able to do anything without Mussolini's help. Mussolini is good at using his wisdom, and even his enemies admire him. I believe that Mussolini must know that once a war breaks out, he will lose his power and destroy the achievements of his hands. Italy's financial resources cannot engage in a war. Italy may be in danger of being forced into the vortex of war, like Austria in the last European war, but I personally do not believe that Italy will do this. I fully believe that Mussolini, because of his familiarity with the economy and his love for his country, will never sign a declaration of war against Britain and France. He must find another way out like he did in Munich."</p>
<h3 id="e62">After the Joint Announcement Was Revealed, the Japanese Side's Remarks: Believing That the Difference Between the Two Concessions' Demands on Japan Lies in Whether to Contact the Pseudo "Municipal Government" <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Mainland News Agency said that a Japanese naval spokesperson claimed when receiving reporters from various newspapers yesterday (the 13th) that after the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council and the French Concession Municipal Council issued a joint announcement on Thursday, the only difference in the attitude of the Japanese side's demands was the different attitudes of the two bureaus towards the "Shanghai Municipal Government." The French authorities directly contacted the "Municipal Government" on certain issues, while the Municipal Council did not even reply to the notes sent by the "Municipal Government." When asked by the spokesperson to detail what he called "certain issues," the naval spokesperson replied that nothing had been determined yet, but they were all minor issues, one of which was related to the French Concession waterworks in the South City. The spokesperson did not know any definite results obtained from the joint announcement, but said that he hoped to see good results soon. At the same time, there was no other criticism of the May 11 announcement prohibiting Chinese political groups in the two concessions by both the Chinese and Japanese sides.</p>
<h3 id="e63">The US Commissioner to the Philippines is Passing Through Shanghai to Go to North China. The Transport Ship is Docked at Woosung and the Commissioner Does Not Disembark. He Will Come to Shanghai at the End of the Month Before Returning Home. <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Mainland News Agency reported that US Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt arrived here on the US Navy transport ship Chaumont on Sunday from Manila, but McNutt did not disembark. The news came from the Chaumont last night (the 13th). The ship was scheduled to dock outside Woosung around 11:00 AM on Sunday, and after unloading a small amount of goods and waiting for two teams of US 4th Marine Regiment soldiers to board the ship to go to Qinhuangdao for summer target practice, it will depart around 5:00 PM on the same day.</p>
<p>Heading to North China</p>
<p>McNutt does not plan to disembark in Shanghai, but will go to North China and make a short stay in Qingdao, Yantai, and Qinhuangdao. On May 23, he will return to Shanghai on the Chaumont. The ship will dock in Shanghai for a week or ten days. McNutt is traveling with his family this time and plans to leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge on May 31 and return to the United States. After arriving in Washington, he will report to President Roosevelt on the situation in the Philippines and is expected to submit his resignation. Most people believe that McNutt is a Democratic candidate for the next US presidential election, so he is expected to devote himself to the election campaign from now until next year. On Sunday, McNutt will not meet with reporters, which was not known last night, but it is generally believed that if reporters can board the transport ship, McNutt may meet with reporters on Sunday afternoon. Among the officers and soldiers who disembarked from the Chaumont on Sunday were 85 Marine Corps officers and soldiers who will join the 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. US Asian Fleet warships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on May 20 include the submarine tender Canopus and six submarines, which will dock in Shanghai for about ten days and then sail to Qingdao.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Shanghai Lacks Investment Opportunities as Domestic Economic Environment Changes (Continued from Yesterday) Overly Optimistic Views of Shanghai's Abnormal Prosperity are Unwarranted Developing the Southwest Economy Depends on Transportation Infrastructure - Report from the Shanghai Banking Corporation's Annual Meeting <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>This year, China's foreign trade has been severely affected by the war. Imports totaled 86,199,000 yuan, a decrease of 67,186,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Exports totaled 762,641,000 yuan, a decrease of 75,615,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The trade deficit was 122,558,000 yuan, an increase of 8,428,000 yuan compared to the previous year. However, the above figures are based on the legal exchange rate of gold units converted to national currency for total import value, while the total export value has been automatically adjusted based on the black market exchange rate, which does not accurately reflect the severity of the impact. If both are calculated in pounds sterling based on the black market exchange rate, the total import value would be £49,708,000, a decrease of £7,079,000 compared to the previous year, and the total export value would be £31,470,000, a decrease of £18,301,000, while the trade deficit would be £18,223,700, a significant increase of £11,220,000 compared to the previous year, indicating that the decline in exports is greater than that of imports.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Stagnant Production <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Due to the westward shift of the war and the expansion of the war zone, many production enterprises have been destroyed, and the output of local goods has decreased. Moreover, transportation is difficult due to blocked traffic. The only gateway for exports during the year was the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, which was also interrupted in the autumn. Fortunately, the government established a trade adjustment agency to actively encourage exports, and major local goods were able to be exported quickly. Otherwise, the decline in the value of export trade might have been even greater.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Grains and Flour <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Among the increased imports, the largest increase was in grains and flour, totaling 130,004,000 yuan, an increase of more than 71 million yuan compared to the previous year. Wheat flour alone increased by more than 46 million yuan, and rice imports also increased by 16 million yuan. This is because the domestic grain supply cannot be transported in large quantities due to the war, and the coastal ports have to rely on imported food.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Metals and Minerals <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The largest decrease in imports was in metals and minerals, totaling 65,117,000 yuan, a decrease of 66 million yuan compared to the previous year. Various construction projects were suspended this year, and metal transportation was difficult, resulting in a significant decrease in imports. The largest import quantities were grains, flour, groceries, oils, candles, soaps, metals, minerals, chemical medicines, machinery, tools, paper, and vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Textiles and Fibers <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The largest increase in exports was in textiles and fibers, totaling 165,127,000 yuan, an increase of more than 36 million yuan compared to the previous year, mainly due to the increase in cotton exports, most of which were shipped to Japan, reaching about 110.1 million yuan, an increase of nearly 70 million yuan compared to the previous year. However, the exports of other textiles and fibers, such as wool and raw silk, decreased.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Sharp Decrease in Oils <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The most significant decrease in exports was in oils, a decrease of more than 53 million yuan, a decrease of 73 million yuan compared to the previous year. This is because tung oil exports fell from more than 89 million yuan in the previous year to more than 39 million yuan this year, due to the impact of blocked inland transportation. The largest export quantities were textiles, fibers, livestock products, minerals, yarn, oils, waxes, and tea.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Japan Ranks First <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>In terms of countries, Japan ranked first in imports this year, increasing from 150.4 million yuan in the previous year to 20.9 billion yuan this year. The United States decreased from 188.8 million yuan in the previous year to 151.2 million yuan. Germany, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies also decreased compared to the previous year. In terms of exports, Hong Kong ranked first, increasing from 162.9 million yuan in the previous year to 243.3 million yuan. Japan increased from 84.3 million yuan in the previous year to 116.5 million yuan. The United States, Britain, and Germany also decreased compared to the previous year.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Shanghai Trade <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>In terms of ports, Shanghai has always accounted for more than half of the country's import and export trade. This year, it decreased from 91.3 billion yuan in the previous year to 49.1 billion yuan, while other ports increased from 87.8 million yuan in the previous year to 11.57 billion yuan. Shanghai's trade accounts for less than one-third of the total trade volume. This is because a port's trade must have a vast and easily accessible hinterland to support it. Now, the Yangtze River basin, which Shanghai relies on as its hinterland, has become a war zone, and all industries have been suspended. Moreover, transportation is difficult due to blocked traffic, and the decline in trade is inevitable. All of these are the effects of the war and deserve our attention.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Domestic Trade <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Domestic trade has also been severely affected by the spread of the war. In the past, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou were important distribution centers for domestic goods. This year, the Yangtze River waterway is still blocked, and it is difficult to transport goods from the war zone. Even trade between the interior and Shanghai and coastal ports has to be rerouted through South China, transported via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Changsha, Hankou, and other places. After the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, goods are either transported through Haiphong, via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming, or through Guangzhou Bay, via highways to Guangxi, or through Wenzhou and Ningbo, via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to the southwestern provinces. Transportation has become increasingly difficult, resulting in a shortage of manufactured goods and coastal products needed in the interior, and prices are rising daily. At the same time, raw materials and grains, such as cotton and wheat, supplied to Shanghai from the interior cannot be transported, and Shanghai factories have to rely on foreign cotton and wheat. If the war continues, the economic structure of the interior may become self-sufficient due to the stagnation of domestic trade.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Prices <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>This year, prices in various regions have fluctuated sharply due to the lack of coordination in the supply and demand of goods, and prices have generally trended upward. The main reason is the stagnation of production or transportation difficulties. Demand has not increased, but supply has decreased significantly. Therefore, although the amount of currency in circulation has not increased significantly, the prices of various goods have continued to rise. In Shanghai, the general price index rose from 134.3 in December of the previous year (with 1929 as 100) to 159.4 in December of this year, an increase of 18%. Except for food, the prices of other commodities have increased significantly. Observing the above table, the price of food has increased less, so the cost of living index in Shanghai has decreased from 158.54 in December of the previous year to 154.93 in December of this year. Compared with January before August 13th, it has increased by more than 41%. However, this cost of living index refers to the living of Shanghai workers. If ordinary salaried people consume a smaller proportion of food, then their index will inevitably be higher than that of December last year. The prices of manufactured goods in the interior have also risen sharply. The price of 20-count cotton yarn in Chongqing once rose to 1,000 yuan per bale. In addition, the prices of daily necessities and luxury goods, such as towels, toothbrushes, cigarettes, and beer, have increased by one or two times, which is common. However, the prices of local goods that rely on exports have fallen due to transportation inconveniences. For example, tung oil and gallnuts are increasing in price in foreign ports, but their prices are falling in the production areas. The price difference is often more than doubled. All of these are due to transportation difficulties and high costs, which have led to a lack of coordination in the supply and demand of goods. However, what is gratifying is that although most commodity prices have fluctuated sharply, food prices in various regions have remained very stable. Except for one or two cities where the number of refugees has suddenly increased, there has been no sharp rise in prices. This is because last year's autumn harvest was abundant, and the supply was sufficient, which helped maintain social order in the interior and made a significant contribution to the wartime economy.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Commerce <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>This year, the changes in industry and commerce in various regions vary greatly due to the different impacts of the war. In Shanghai, except for the Chinese areas that have been destroyed and Hongkou and Yangshupu that have not yet been opened, the industry and commerce within the concessions have experienced abnormal prosperity, and the profits are unprecedented. The reasons are:</p>
<h3 id="e77">Increase in Refugee Population <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Funds also flowed in, stimulating various consumer industries, such as department stores, entertainment, food and beverage, and transportation. Their turnover and profits have increased significantly. Due to the dense population, housing problems have arisen, and rents have risen daily. The long-depressed real estate industry has also become active, but only in small-scale real estate transactions for housing and factory use.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Establishment of Foreign Exchange Black Market <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>After the establishment of the foreign exchange black market, the exchange rate decreased, and importers who had inventories made double profits, such as hardware, Western medicine, and woolen industries. Even those who suffered great losses during the war were often able to make up for them. Exporters also obtained good prices for their goods due to favorable exchange rates. For example, the silk cocoon industry, which has been depressed for many years, has shown signs of recovery this year due to the sharp rise in prices.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Sharp Reduction in Goods Production <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The sharp reduction in goods production has led to a situation of supply falling short of demand. For example, the cotton textile industry, due to the complete shutdown of yarn factories in the interior, has to rely on Shanghai for its cotton yarn. However, only yarn factories in the safe areas of the concessions are operating in Shanghai, so the demand far exceeds the supply, and the price of yarn has soared. The profit per bale often reaches hundreds of yuan, and the year-end profits are very substantial. Other industries, such as cotton weaving, silk weaving, iron industry, enamel industry, and match industry, also have the same phenomenon. Therefore, the establishment of small-scale new factories after the war has been very active.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Obstruction of Transportation in Production Areas <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The obstruction of transportation in production areas has led to a shortage of goods sources, and those with inventories have monopolized and hoarded goods. For example, cotton, dry cocoons, and raw cowhide industries have experienced shortages of goods sources, and prices have continued to rise. Those with large inventories have reaped huge profits. These factors have led to the abnormal prosperity of Shanghai today, which is a special phenomenon of the wartime economy. However, these reasons are mostly temporary in nature. Consumers cannot consume permanently, and producers cannot manipulate the supply. Moreover, the more the hinterland falls, the narrower the market becomes. Therefore, the economic prospects of Shanghai in the future should not be overly optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Industry and Commerce in the Interior <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Industry and commerce in the interior that have fallen into the war zone are all at a standstill, and the losses are huge and cannot be estimated. In the southwestern provinces, factories that have moved from the occupied areas have initially concentrated in Hankou from the Beijing-Shanghai area, and then gradually moved to the southwest with the factories in Wuhan. Although transportation is extremely difficult, they have finally reached their destinations, and some have already started manufacturing. Their spirit is commendable. In terms of commerce, in large cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming, the surface also shows a prosperous phenomenon due to the increase in population. Although the people are often under the threat of air raids, various industries have made progress. However, due to transportation difficulties, there is often a shortage of daily necessities, and local goods for export have become sluggish. Therefore, the development of the southwestern economy must focus on transportation infrastructure. At present, the government is actively building railways and highways and setting up various transportation facilities, so transportation will inevitably become more convenient in the future, and the development of the southwestern economy will be easier to carry out. In summary, it can be seen that the domestic economic environment has undergone significant changes due to the war.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Foreign Economic Situation <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>As for the foreign economic situation, under the situation of tense diplomacy and arms race, the phenomenon of recession is more common. In the United Kingdom, the entire year was in a recession. According to the business activity index of the London School of Economics, it continued to fall from 111.0 in December of last year (with 1935 as 100) to 10.5 in December of this year, a decrease of about 10%. Prices have also fallen, and the number of unemployed people has increased. The reasons are that it was initially affected by the collapse of prices and the stock market in the United States, and then foreign trade became increasingly sluggish due to world political unrest, leading to a deterioration of the international balance of payments. The position of the pound sterling is very weak. In September, due to the Czech crisis, the exchange rate between the pound and the US dollar continued to fall, reaching more than 4.6 yuan. In the United States, the economic situation in the first half of the year remained sluggish after the stock market turmoil in the autumn of the previous year. However, after May, President Roosevelt once again expanded the budget and spent huge amounts of relief funds. Due to the increase in market chips, various industries gradually became active, and stock and commodity prices trended upward again. At the same time, the inventories of major commodities have decreased significantly since the production cuts last year, and the domestic and foreign preparations for war are becoming increasingly urgent, and the demand for military supplies is extremely high, so industrial production has been stimulated, and export trade has been slightly able to maintain the level of the previous year. The situation is better than in the United Kingdom. In France, prices continued to rise due to the devaluation of the franc, but the production index only increased slightly at the end of the year, and the number of unemployed people has not decreased. Moreover, due to the expansion of military preparations, the budget deficit has become increasingly large. At the end of this year, a new financial and economic plan was implemented, extending workers' working hours to increase production, reducing government spending, and improving tax revenue to achieve budget balance. The financial organization of the government has been strengthened to attract the return of funds. Various economic situations are in the process of adjustment. Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and other countries, under controlled economies, are taking preparations for war as their sole purpose, promoting various plans to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Improving the people's lives is no longer the current goal. Looking at the economic situation of various countries, although they are not as directly affected by the war as China, they have lost their normal development due to preparations for war and coping with the war. They are all sacrificing everything to seek the enrichment of military power. The hope for world peace in the future is almost non-existent. This is something that we cannot help but feel infinitely regretful after observing the domestic and foreign environment. (End)</p>

<p>The neighbor of Limin Textile Company on Taiwan Road (near Wufu Lane) is Jiandong Cotton Cloth Shop, opened by a Cantonese named Che Fengshi. Because the rent has been expensive in recent years, the shop converted the roof terrace, which displayed flowers and potted plants, into a house. This project was contracted by a Lu as foreman. On the afternoon of the 21st of last month, when the craftsmen were working, they moved the potted plants because they were obstructing construction. Unexpectedly, they all fell and hit the newly purchased car of Ma Shaoquan, the general manager of Limin Company, which was parked in front of the company. As a result, the ceramic pots were shattered, and the car was damaged. Ma immediately reported the incident to the local police, who inspected the scene and reported the incident to the Zhabei Police Station together with Che. After the head of the police questioned the circumstances of the incident, he ruled that since the car owner requested compensation, it was a civil matter and ordered him to pursue the matter himself. Ma then summoned a photographer to take pictures of the damage on that day and repaired the car. Che Fengshi initially agreed to compensate for the loss, but later refused to be responsible for the compensation because the amount of loss claimed by Ma was too large. Therefore, Ma hired Lawyer Wang to file a lawsuit against Che in the First Special Court, seeking a judgment ordering the defendant to compensate for the repair costs of 282 yuan in legal tender, the car rental fee of 150 yuan for hiring a car for ten days during the repair period, and 500 yuan for the loss caused by the fact that the car could not be restored to its original condition even after the repair, as well as litigation costs. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu held a court hearing and ordered the plaintiff to drive the car to the court for inspection at the next continued hearing for verification.</p>

<p>Deng Yangshi, an old woman from Jiangbei, Zhu Lushi, and Zhang Wangshi, a woman from Nanjing, who lived in a bungalow on Hart Road, colluded on the morning of April 25th at about 11 o'clock to deceive their neighbor, He Gendi, a young girl from Jiangbei, Gao Gendi, and Chen Xiuying, a woman from Tianjin, by falsely introducing them to work in a yarn factory in Yangshupu, and took them to a brothel founded by Feng Lushi, a woman from Funing, at No. 14 Zhihe Lane, Yunnan Road, where they were confined upstairs and forced into prostitution. The three girls did not want to receive guests and cried and made noise all day long. At 10:30 AM on the 26th, Feng Zhengbiao (a Chinese policeman from the Zhabei Police Station), the husband of Feng Lushi, who was from Xuzhou, came and released the three young girls. Subsequently, the Putuo Road Police Station sent detectives to arrest Deng Yangshi and Zhu Lushi and send them to the First Special Court. They confessed that Feng Zhengbiao and his wife were involved. The police added them to the position of the defendant and sent them to the Third Criminal Court the previous morning. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, filed a public prosecution based on the crimes of abduction and obstruction of freedom under the criminal law. Feng Zhengbiao hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. Judge Jiang Shuzi clearly interrogated the five male and female defendants, including Deng Yangshi, and ordered them to be returned to custody separately, with a date for the verdict to be announced.</p>

<p>Zheng Boju, a Cantonese, operated Hengtai and other pawnshops in Shanghai during his lifetime, accumulating assets of over one million yuan. He owned many properties in the central and northern districts of the Public Concession and in Zhabei in the Chinese area. Zheng had two wives, Shen and Weng, and a total of four sons, Jishen, Jihao, Jiqian, and Jijie, and three daughters, Sufang, Suchai, and Meiyu. After Zheng died of illness in August 1935, his estate was entrusted to his brother Zhongping to manage on his behalf, who took over a portion of it. Although the sons have negotiated, it has not been resolved so far. The remaining real estate deeds, savings books, stocks, and other documents are all in the hands of Jiqian, the third son who studied at the Soochow Law School. Jishen, the eldest son, united with his younger siblings and repeatedly asked him to hand over the full amount so that it could be divided according to the names. However, Jiqian initially made excuses and procrastinated. Later, unable to occupy it for a long time, he gathered everyone to divide it. After agreeing on the terms of the division and drafting a draft, he refused to sign it, hoping to overturn the agreement and monopolize it for a long time. Jishen and Jihao believed that Jiqian's attitude was malicious and intended to swallow the income from the estate, which was obvious. It was difficult to be deceived by him again, so they hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to file a lawsuit against Jiqian in the First Special District Local Court, detailing the facts of the defendant's seizure of various estates and delaying the analysis. Based on the provisions of the Civil Code for heirs inheriting the estate, they requested a judgment ordering the defendant (except for the retained portion for recovery) to hand over the seized property and divide it into four shares according to the conditions stated in the established property division contract, with each of the four brothers receiving one share, and ordering the defendant to bear the litigation costs. After the court held a hearing once before, it was postponed because both the plaintiff and the defendant intended to settle peacefully, so that they could settle it outside. The hearing date was again on the afternoon of the other day. Judge Gui asked about the situation of the two parties conducting peaceful settlement outside. Since the opinions of the two parties were very close and there was a possibility of peaceful settlement, all those named in the property division draft should be included in the peaceful settlement group of the case to avoid other complications in the future. Therefore, he ordered a change of date and asked the plaintiff and defendant to correct the documents and re-examine them.</p>

<p>According to reports from relevant sources, a tobacco smuggling case recently occurred in the puppet "Police Bureau Water Police Station." The whistleblower is Liu Jingwu, a puppet "police officer" from Liaoning. The case is currently being thoroughly investigated by the puppet "Police Headquarters." Recently, smugglers have been transporting tobacco in the Huangpu River, and the puppet "Water Police Team" sends "police officers" to inspect various debts every night. At 4 AM on the morning of the 3rd of this month, many smugglers were carrying a large amount of tobacco between the wharves of the British Taikoo Company and Longmao Foreign Firm in Pudong (ie, the Pudong Waterworks Wharf). Another gang of smugglers learned of this and went to rob the tobacco. Both sides had pistols and fired at each other. In the chaos, a lot of tobacco was thrown into the Huangpu River. Subsequently, Liu Jingwu, a "police officer" of the puppet "Water Police Team," arrested Xiao Yu, a robber, and Cang, a boatman transporting the tobacco, on the spot, and fished up ten packages of tobacco from the river, each weighing 100 taels, for a total of 1,000 taels, worth tens of thousands of yuan. They were taken to the puppet "Team" together. Unexpectedly, the robbers were released afterwards. Of the ten packages of tobacco seized, only four packages were handed over to the "Headquarters," and two of them were separated from one package, so only three packages were actually left. The whereabouts of the remaining seven packages (ie, 700 taels), worth tens of thousands of yuan, are unknown. Liu was very angry and reported the smuggling to the puppet "Municipal Government." The puppet "Director" Lu Ying was dispatched to investigate, but the whistleblower Liu Jingwu was beaten with 500 military sticks by the puppet Director Huo Liangchen and then detained. The case has not yet been resolved.</p>

<p>Economic Special Article on the So-Called "Huaxing Commercial Bank" and Its Role by Han Hui</p>
<p>The so-called "Huaxing Commercial Bank," jointly established by the Nanjing "Reformed Government" and Japanese banks, was founded in Shanghai amidst the plummeting market price of "Lian Yin" currency in Tianjin. According to Chen Jintao, the "President" of the bank, and Tsuda from the Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, "The bank's capital is 50 million yuan, half from the Japanese and half from the puppet regime. It will issue 'Huaxing currency' at the same value as legal tender, and it 'will be freely convertible into foreign currency.'" Tsuda also stated that "Japanese residents will be the first to use its banknotes." Some people find it incomprehensible that after the disastrous fall in the price of the "Lian Yin" currency in the north and its failure to replace legal tender, there is still an attempt to promote "Huaxing" currency in Shanghai and the Jiangnan region. In reality, this issue is not as simple as most people think and deserves careful examination.</p>
<p>The development process of imperialist economic aggression begins with commodity exports and progresses to capital exports. However, the era of capital exports does not stop commodity exports; it requires further expansion of commodity exports to increase capital accumulation. The purpose of capital exports is to manipulate the finance and industry of the colonies—especially the currency system. The so-called dollar bloc and sterling bloc are the most successful examples of capital exports. Japan, due to a lack of raw materials for heavy industry, has built its industrial base on light industry. The balance of international payments depends entirely on light industry and even the export of semi-finished agricultural products (such as silk cocoons). As for the export of capital, only the Northeast provinces have seen some success; otherwise, it cannot compete with the United States, Britain, and France. Moreover, its main raw materials for light industry, such as wool and cotton, still rely on imports from abroad. After the "September 18th Incident," the seizure of the four northeastern provinces of China did solve the shortage of raw materials for its heavy industry, but the scarcity of essential raw materials for light industry remained unresolved. To solve this problem, there was the movement to specialize Inner Mongolia and North China and the so-called "yen bloc" of Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. However, Japan's operation of the four northeastern provinces had already exhausted most of its capital, leaving it with no resources to realize this conspiracy. Furthermore, due to the success of the central legal tender policy and the firm support of the North China authorities, the so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and the yen bloc plan all failed. After the Japanese army occupied North China, the "United Reserve Bank," established by the "Provisional Government of Peiping," issued "Lian Yin" currency. The plan was to completely eliminate legal tender and make it the sole currency in the north, realizing its yen bloc conspiracy. However, in reality, the influence of legal tender in North China was not as weak as that of banknotes from the Fengtian era, so even with the backing of Japanese bayonets, the promotion of "Lian Yin" currency for over a year was limited to certain Japanese-occupied city strongholds and never became the sole currency in the north. There were many reasons for its failure, but generally speaking:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the prolonged Sino-Japanese war, excessive issuance of public bonds, and currency inflation, the price of the yen fluctuated, and the price of "Lian Yin" currency, linked to the yen, inevitably plummeted.</p>
<p>(2) Legal tender had sufficient reserves, and the recent establishment of a foreign exchange equalization fund has stabilized the "black market" in Shanghai, leading to widespread public confidence.</p>
<p>(3) The ruling power of the Japanese and puppet regimes was still confined to certain city strongholds, with most of the land still under the control of the central government.</p>
<p>(4) The attempt to seize silver in the Tianjin concession failed, and foreign banks in the United States, Britain, and France unanimously rejected "Lian Yin" currency.</p>
<p>(5) "Lian Yin" currency had no reserves, and the amount issued was enormous, leading to soaring prices and a disastrous fall in currency value. (The market price of counterfeit currency in Tianjin once fell to about 60% of the value of legal tender.)</p>
<p>(6) The recent victories of the central government's military counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Lian Yin" currency was only barely circulating in the Japanese-occupied cities of the north, and once it entered the countryside, it became the world of legal tender, leaving no room for "Lian Yin" currency to circulate. Japan's conspiracy to issue "Lian Yin" currency to replace legal tender can be said to have failed in the north. However, it has been quite effective in controlling foreign exchange, restricting import and export trade, and promoting the sales of Japanese goods through the use of "Lian Yin," as evidenced by the sharp increase in imports of Japanese goods and the sharp decrease in imports of European and American goods in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army initially occupied Shanghai and the Jiangnan region the year before last, it forced the use of some military scrip. Its original intention was that once these military scrips were used in the occupied areas, it would only need to pay some printing costs to exchange them for huge amounts of agricultural products for its light industry's raw materials and food supplies, thus saving its collapsing economic structure. However, after Chinese merchants collected this military scrip, they quickly went to Shanghai or other commercial ports to buy Japanese goods from Japanese merchants. Although the import of Japanese goods was increasing rapidly, its goal of obtaining industrial raw materials and food for free was not achieved, and it instead gave up the foreign exchange export resources that could have been obtained. Although Japanese small and medium-sized merchants dared not openly refuse military scrip, they were already complaining. Japan's original intention was that this military scrip could alleviate its malignant currency inflation crisis, but now it has completely failed. Therefore, the "Huaxing Bank" established this time is formally different from the "Lian Yin" in the north, mainly in two aspects:</p>
<p>First, the difference in nature: "Lian Yin" was jointly formed by the "Beijing Provisional Government" and by forcing northern banks to participate, while "Huaxing" is invested by the "Nanjing Reformed Government" and the six major Japanese banks. Although the former could establish credit loans from the Bank of Korea, it was not directly invested by Japanese banks, while the latter is clearly jointly owned by the six major Japanese banks. The addition of the words "Commercial" after "Huaxing" also makes it different from the so-called "national bank" nature of "Lian Yin."</p>
<p>Second, the difference in currency value: "Lian Yin" currency was at par with the yen and was intended to replace legal tender (its failure has been mentioned above), while "Huaxing" currency is said to be prepared to replace legal tender and is not linked to the yen.</p>
<p>As for the role of issuing "Huaxing currency," it can be summarized in the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Japan uses "Huaxing" currency in Japanese-occupied areas to exchange legal tender and absorb foreign exchange in the Shanghai "black market," eroding the reserves of legal tender to increase its ability to pay for its war expenses in China.</p>
<p>Japan wants to use "Huaxing" currency to plunder industrial raw materials and food in the occupied areas for a long time without limitation, and refuse Chinese merchants to directly purchase Japanese goods with "Huaxing" currency, so that Japanese small and medium-sized merchants will not suffer the pain of receiving military scrip again.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese and puppet regimes use "Huaxing" currency to pay part of the expenses of the Japanese troops stationed in China and the expenses of the puppet organizations, in order to make up for the financial panic on both sides.</p>
<p>(4) "Huaxing" Bank may become Japan's agency for controlling foreign exchange and foreign trade in Shanghai and the Jiangnan region. It will force export merchants to sell foreign exchange to "Huaxing," thereby enriching yen reserves and promoting the import of Japanese goods by utilizing the occupation of the Yangtze River and inland river transportation, squeezing out the market for European and American goods. In other words, it wants to increase its capital accumulation by expanding commodity exports.</p>
<p>The above four roles can be said to be progressing simultaneously, and their ultimate goal is nothing more than to exclude the economic interests of Britain and the United States, undermine the legal tender system, and complete its delusion of incorporating the Shanghai financial market into the yen bloc. However, this kind of purpose has no possibility of being realized.</p>
<p>First, if "Huaxing" currency is used to redeem legal tender, because the credit of legal tender is stable and the amount of "Huaxing" currency issued is unlimited, the people in the occupied areas will inevitably hoard legal tender and raise the price of legal tender, and the disastrous fall in the price of "Huaxing" currency is inevitable.</p>
<p>Second, as a result of the excessive issuance of "Huaxing" currency, prices in the occupied areas will inevitably rise: not only will the progress of Japan's purchase of agricultural products in Jiangnan to supplement industrial raw materials and food be hampered, but also due to the reduction in purchasing power of the people in the occupied areas, the import of Japanese goods will be drastically reduced.</p>
<p>Third, the disastrous fall in the value of "Huaxing" currency and the soaring prices will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of Chinese merchants in the war zone. The puppet organizations that rely on urban merchants will inevitably become more panicked financially, and the Japanese army's method of local supply will inevitably become more difficult.</p>
<p>Fourth, if Japan uses "Huaxing" Bank to control foreign exchange in Shanghai, it will be difficult to succeed from the objective environment.</p>
<p>The above contradictions are the inevitable results of the issuance of "Huaxing" currency, which will not only fail to help the Japanese economic structure but will accelerate its collapse. Japan has also seen this crisis, so it has not yet confirmed the plan to control foreign exchange in Shanghai, and wants to use other means to induce cooperation between Chinese and European and American merchants. The hope of its success is even more slim. Therefore, although there was a preliminary "founding meeting," there has been no follow-up so far, which shows the high degree of self-doubt.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Second Recording of This Journal's Forum: The Question of Price Balancing (Continued) <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Date: April 26th, 10:00 AM</p>
<p>Location: Conference Hall on the Fifth Floor of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Wang Yutong: Although Shanghai has formed a unique environment, the rapid increase in population and the soaring prices have a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Moreover, Shanghai is still the economic center of China during the war. Therefore, in addition to the commodities that have been manipulated by certain forces, we urgently need to find ways to stabilize Shanghai's prices. The responsibility for the entire wartime economy is far more than what can be described by the following starting points of morality and maintaining social order and tranquility. The proposed control methods are listed in three points:</p>
<p>1.  From a moral starting point, each trade association should implement individual autonomous control based on the actual supply and demand relationship of goods and in the spirit of national service.</p>
<p>2.  For the sake of maintaining social order and tranquility, each public group should jointly request the municipal authorities to order each trade association to jointly and conscientiously study control methods, such as the previous balancing of rice prices, which is one example.</p>
<p>3.  Actively seek substitutes and encourage the invention of substitutes.</p>
<p>Zhang Ziyun: The main reason for the current rise in prices is the decrease in production. At the same time, if consumption can be automatically reduced, the trend of rising prices can be slowed down. Therefore, promoting a frugal movement among the people is also a way to balance prices.</p>
<p>Liu Xingchen: The prices of agricultural products in rural areas are generally declining, while urban prices are rising uniformly. This is due to the obstruction of the flow of goods. Therefore, to talk about balance, opening up the transportation lines is the first priority. At the same time, rural prices should also be increased.</p>
<p>Li Quanshi: That's right, we must rely on local products.</p>
<p>Zhu Sihuang: The financial industry can make some contributions to rent issues. Because in addition to owning their own properties, silver houses are often entrusted to manage rental properties. From the perspective of managing rental properties, they can mediate between landlords and tenants. When they encounter a landlord asking them to handle rent increases, they can say a few fair words from the sidelines, advising both parties to reach a fair and reasonable solution.</p>
<p>In addition to the silver industry, the courts should also use their power of judgment on rent increase issues and strive for true justice. Then, rent disputes can also be resolved to a large extent.</p>
<p>Li Quanshi: If the Municipal Council can restrict the influx of people from other places into Shanghai, such as refugees, the prices in Shanghai can be lowered. But in reality, this is absolutely impossible because humanitarianism and compassion are common to all mankind.</p>
<p>Zhu Sihuang: Rising prices are not entirely harmful. For example, rising prices of foreign goods can reduce the import of non-essential goods, and rising prices of luxury goods can reduce waste. However, rising prices of daily necessities greatly affect people's livelihoods. Therefore, the policy of stabilizing prices does not need to be to return all prices to the same level. The higher the price of luxury goods, the better. Only appropriate adjustments to the prices of necessities are needed. As for the policy of stabilizing the prices of necessities, although it is difficult, it is not entirely without hope. Here are some of my personal views:</p>
<p>1.  The government should adjust supply and demand as much as possible within its capabilities. Although the government has moved west, it is still concerned about the economic situation in the occupied areas. For example, the government and the people are very cautious about the resumption of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The people of Shanghai have not diminished their patriotism. Therefore, the government should still control as much as possible within its capabilities.</p>
<p>2.  Merchants should initiate a voluntary fair-price movement. Trade associations and the Chamber of Commerce should jointly agree on fair-price measures and abide by them. These organizations are indeed institutions representing the interests of various industries, but there are many insightful people in each industry. Even if they do not consider the people's livelihood, they should know that if prices rise too quickly, they will fall back more severely in the future. Only focusing on current interests will create future failures. Therefore, for the sake of the interests of each industry itself, they should also broaden their horizons and have each trade association automatically agree on a fair-price plan, cracking down on hoarding, speculation, and manipulation, which is precisely to protect their future interests. Moreover, the Chamber of Commerce has the nature of a local public welfare institution, and should also consider the interests of the people's livelihood and take the lead in advocating this.</p>
<p>3.  Promote thrift. Promoting thrift is to reduce unnecessary consumption. On the one hand, it can use the power of consumers to resist the manipulation of suppliers.</p>
<p>4.  The financial industry should pay attention to lending. The contraction and expansion of credit in the financial industry has a great impact on prices. Therefore, close attention should be paid to loans and discounts, and credit should not be used to subsidize hoarding and fuel speculation. Currently, the financial industry is generally very cautious about lending. In short, the financial industry cannot shirk its responsibility for stabilizing prices.</p>

We hope readers will pay attention to it. Editor</p>
<p>Recently, sugar prices in Shanghai have been rising sharply, partly because domestic sources have decreased and partly because the cost of foreign sugar is expensive. Before the war, Guangdong machine-made white sugar accounted for 300,000 metric tons annually, but it has now disappeared. Due to transportation difficulties, Min and Guang local sugar used to account for 500,000 to 600,000 dan (white sugar accounted for only 10-20%), but now it is only 300,000 metric tons. Dutch sugar (i.e., produced in Java) is more expensive due to the black market exchange rate. Due to these two reasons, prices have increased.</p>
<p>However, the Hong Kong Taikoo Sugar Refinery is operating quite prosperously at this time. Currently, white sugar, Javanese raw sugar, and Taikoo refined sugar account for 80% of the sales in Shanghai. Qing sugar relies entirely on local products from Min and Guang; Dutch sugar accounts for 20% of red sugar, and Min and Guang sugar accounts for 80%; rock sugar is all made in China, with Shanghai factories accounting for 80% and Xiamen factories accounting for 20%. Regarding Shanghai white sugar, although the market price is expensive, it is still relatively cheap compared to overseas prices. According to world production, cane sugar and beet sugar each account for half; among cane sugar, Cuba, Java, and India are the largest producers. This year, India's domestic production and sales are short by more than 300,000 tons; it has purchased from Java and European markets. This year, Japan and Taiwan's production has increased by more than one million dan compared to previous years. In addition to domestic sales, the rest is dumped in the Far East and North China; sales in Central China are minimal. Although the Shanghai Minghua factory is refining, only small merchants are selling it, and its domestic market price is even higher than that of Shanghai. In the past, in addition to Taiwan, the raw materials for Japanese sugar factories were purchased from Java and Cuba to make up for the shortage; now, due to restrictions on foreign exchange, they cannot be purchased freely, so production is not high. As for European beet sugar, Germany is the first; this year's production is more than 2 million tons, but it is now being prepared for military needs by various countries and is becoming increasingly insufficient; it is planned to purchase sugar cane-made sugar from sugar cane-producing areas to supplement it. Looking at overseas sugar prices, they are also trending higher. The reason why Shanghai cannot rise to the overseas level is that during the Anti-Japanese War, foreign shipping lines have not been interrupted, and sources are still open, but domestic transportation is blocked and sales are difficult, resulting in a situation of oversupply.</p>
<p>Southern China is originally a sugar-producing area. It is hoped that the government will encourage sugar cane planting and protect small-scale industries so that all villages have the ability to produce, and annual production will increase. It can supply Shanghai sales as much as possible, so the Shanghai market does not need to rely on foreign sugar anymore.</p>

<p>The author is one of the persons in charge of China Cotton Industry and Hengjian Yarn Factory. This article was originally a written report prepared for the price forum held by this journal. It speaks from an insider's perspective, and every sentence is practical. We hope readers will pay attention to it. Editor</p>
<p>Since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, yarn and cloth prices have skyrocketed. The highest value of 20-count Jincheng yarn once reached 515 yuan per piece, more than doubling compared to before the war. The prices of various thick and thin fabrics have also doubled accordingly. Although prices once fell due to the fall of Guangzhou, they soon gradually rebounded. To this day, they still maintain a considerable high price. Factors such as foreign exchange tightening, transportation difficulties, and increased costs are all related; however, the most important reason is that textile factories have been affected by the war, with some stopping or being destroyed, resulting in reduced production and a shortage of supply. You can get an idea of the general situation by reading the following.</p>
<p>The textile factories located in China can be divided into three types according to their operators: Chinese, Japanese, and British. The number of yarn spindles and looms they owned before the war is shown in the first table.</p>
<p>First Table (Excerpt from the List of Chinese Yarn Factories published by the United Association of Chinese Yarn Factories in July 1937)</p>
<p>(A) Chinese</p>
<p>Location	Number of Factories	Number of Spindles	Number of Looms</p>
<p>Shanghai	31	1,114,408	8,754</p>
<p>Jiangsu	23	615,548	7,288</p>
<p>Hebei	7	174,896	1,490</p>
<p>Henan	7	314,472	3,259</p>
<p>Other Provinces	28	517,068	4,712</p>
<p>Total	96	2,746,392	25,503</p>
<p>(B) Japanese</p>
<p>Location	Number of Factories	Number of Spindles	Number of Looms</p>
<p>Shanghai	30	1,331,421	17,283</p>
<p>Other Ports	18	803,658	11,632</p>
<p>Total	48	2,135,068	28,915</p>
<p>(C) British</p>
<p>Location	Number of Factories	Number of Spindles	Number of Looms</p>
<p>Shanghai	4	221,336	4,021</p>
<p>(D) Total of Chinese and Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Location	Number of Factories	Number of Spindles	Number of Looms</p>
<p>National	148	5,102,798	58,439</p>
<p>During this war, most factories have been affected, with the exception of a few, some almost completely ceasing operations. After the war moved west, some began to plan for resumption. The British merchants belong to a third country, and their textile factories have hardly been damaged, and they have now all resumed operations. It is estimated that the Japanese merchants have lost 750,000 spindles and 11,500 looms. As for the Chinese textile factories, because most of them are in the occupied areas, not only is it impossible to resume work, but also the extent of the damage is unknown. However, according to Japanese newspapers, under the name of "military management" in North China, the Chinese factories operated and put into operation by Japanese merchants are shown in the second table.</p>
<p>In Central China, the Chinese factories were first distributed autonomously by Japanese merchants, and those approved by their military department are 40 factories, and the number of their spindles and looms is shown in the third table.</p>
<p>Third Table (Survey in December 1938)</p>
<p>Note: The factory marked with the "※" symbol is jointly operated with Taian Company.</p>
<p>Although the above factories have been approved by the military department and are operated by certain Japanese merchants, some of them are still occupied by the military department, or contain complex international elements. As of the end of last year, 336,124 spindles and 2,344 looms had been opened, and the number of spindles and looms opened by the factories originally owned by Japanese merchants is shown in the fourth table.</p>
<p>Adding the Chinese factories that are under their "military management", the number is shown in the fifth table.</p>
<p>Referring to the first table (B) and the fifth table, it can be seen that the number of spindles and looms opened by Japanese merchants is sufficient to match the pre-war situation, while the number owned by Chinese merchants has been greatly reduced. You can see it by reading the sixth table.</p>
<p>Comparing the sixth table with the first table (A), the reduction rate is shown in the seventh table. (To be continued)</p>

<p>English Pure Gold Remains Stable</p>
<p>The cash price of Chihchih in the black market did not change yesterday due to the Sunday holiday and the low attendance of members. We heard that there were no transactions in the retail departments of money exchange companies, and the price was around the closing price of the previous day. 2,127 yuan were sold, and 23 yuan were received.</p>
<p>The exchange rate of gold jewelry in silver shops has also not changed. Da Tong Hang quoted 215 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang quoted 213 yuan. The purchase price was 207 yuan in both.</p>
<p>London, May 13th. English pure gold is stable, remaining at £7 8s 5½d per ounce. Large bars unchanged.</p>
<p>London, May 13th. The silver market saw a few purchases from India, and the market was quite stable. The prices of large silver bars for near and far terms were unchanged. New York reports that the spot price of American silver is still stable. Bombay reports that the prices of Indian silver for spot and futures are both up one anna. The market is calm, with a total of 25 transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Huaxing Opening: Rumored for Tomorrow, Therefore Maintaining Lianchao <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>It is rumored that the "Huaxing" Bank will open tomorrow (16th). It is divided into seven sections internally, and the heads are all Japanese. Even the tea servers are mostly Japanese. The people recommended by Liang and Chen can hardly get important positions, and the result will be that they are idle, eating and getting paid for doing nothing. Banknotes are the main purpose of establishing the bank, and they will inevitably be issued. However, according to financial circles, since this banknote has no reserves, it will inevitably not be able to purchase foreign exchange. If it is used to seek foreign exchange through roundabout means, it will be unfavorable to the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange, which will not be a blessing for Chinese and foreign merchants. Therefore, foreign merchants will definitely not accept it. Apart from this, it will seek foreign exchange from the commodity side to promote the circulation of the banknote, but the result will only be to achieve barter. However, in order to issue "Huaxing" banknotes, the "Lianchao" in North China has recently been vigorously raised to more than 80% of its face value. The intention is to maintain "Lianchao" to help "Huaxing" issue banknotes, but after the fall, the trick has long been seen through.</p>
<p>Beijing Newsletter: Recently, due to the sharp drop in the value of counterfeit banknotes in the Ping City, the prices of various commodities have soared. Taking rice and flour as an example, the selling price of rice has reached 30 yuan per dan, and the price of flour has reached 7 yuan per bag. The pseudo "Provisional Government" has failed in its original plan to destroy legal tender. The ban on the use of legal tender since March 10 has recently been lifted, and legal tender is allowed to continue to be used, intending to use this opportunity to absorb the people's legal tender with "Lian Yin" banknotes. The excuse is that the people still have a large amount of legal tender, and in order to avoid losses to the people, the ban is lifted for two months.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Grain: Wushan Rice Still Transportable, Japonica Rice Traded Verbally <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The sources of Do-japonica rice from various gangs and the Jiangxia area totaled 11,000 to 12,000 bags from the Nangang gang. The Su-Tong gang delivered 2,500 to 2,600 bags of steamed buns by train. As the arrival of goods gradually increased, and the Evaluation Committee repeatedly announced strict price limits, invited the concession authorities and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to participate, and planned to purchase foreign rice to open up sources, people's sentiment slightly improved. It is rumored that Wuhu can also be shipped, and there is a rumor that 10,000 bags will be shipped out soon. Therefore, the eagerness of customers to go has relaxed. High-quality goods and polished rice are sold together at 14 yuan, and thick and thin japonica rice is traded secretly, seemingly openly. Do-japonica rice is rumored to be sold at 16.5 yuan, and Nan-japonica rice is sold at 16 to 16.3 yuan. Other high-quality thin rice is also sold at 16 to 16.5 yuan, but the situation has faded, not as excited as the previous market. As for inferior goods, they are still sold at 15 yuan. Moreover, most of these secret trades are verbal transactions, so it is impossible to conduct a real investigation; one can only rely on the morality of each person. Do-foreign-pointed rice is still lacking in the market, and Bianyuan rice and foreign glutinous rice are all held at the original price.</p>
<p>Although there is a rumor that certificates for moving out and banning the transportation of passenger indica rice have been stopped, the roads to Shanghai have been continuous and have not been interrupted in recent days. According to Wuhu news, it can be shipped out by finding ways. Yesterday, another 5,000 to 6,000 bags arrived, and the prices of rough rice made from Wuhu indica rice have fallen by 10 to 20 cents across the board, and Beijing indica rice has also returned to the same level. However, the secret price of high-quality Beijing indica rice still needs 14.5 yuan, and Wuhu indica rice is around 14 yuan, with varying prices for medium and inferior quality.</p>

<p>The British Sugar Industry Conference has not yet made a decision.</p>
<p>Although the proposal to increase Cuba's production by 200,000 tons has not been passed, the seller still plans to find a suitable proposal to help. If it can proceed smoothly, the meeting can be closed this Wednesday, so sugar prices are likely to change a lot in the next few days. Yesterday, London reported that the near and far terms were both down by 2/8d, with August at 7 shillings and 3 pence, December at 6 shillings and 3.25 pence, and March next year at 6 shillings and 3.75 pence. Hong Kong reported that the cost of packaging to Shanghai has decreased by half a yuan to 20 yuan. As a result, the public market has weakened again. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar is down by 10 cents, with the price at our own shop at 27.6 yuan and the price at other shops at 27.4 yuan. The price of transit goods has dropped even more, with newly arrived goods at 19.4 to 19.3 yuan, with 300 bags traded, and customs goods at 19.2 yuan, with 500 bags traded, and then at 19 yuan, with 500 bags traded. Dutch red sugar and local cotton white sugar have not changed. Taikoo car white sugar is down by 20 cents, with the price of B-mark at 27.2 yuan, and so on. The domestic sugar market is also fluctuating, with a weak trend. Only the Chao gang has released dozens of bags of inferior cotton white sugar at 24.6 yuan. The price of diao sugar is too harsh, and no transaction has been made.</p>

<p>Yantai Island Shrimp Tails: Seeing the new beginning, more have recently arrived. The quality of the goods is better than before. Yesterday, the opening market price was 118 yuan. As the weather is gradually warming and it is not easy to store, the market trend has weakened. The first batch was 140 yuan, and it has now fallen by 22 yuan.</p>

<p>The sales of fine coal were still smooth last month, and the arrival of goods from various places was continuous. However, recently the needs of factories have gradually been met, and retail sales in front of the shops are also limited, resulting in sporadic transactions in the market. Daily transactions are less than 1,000 tons. Self-dismantling by the same industry is calculated as follows: Indian fine coal is 40 yuan per ton, Kaiping special fine coal is 41 yuan, and Yuanshan fine coal is 24 yuan. The above are all warehouse shipments, and the labor costs of the porters are added separately.</p>

<p>The sales of lily slices are approaching the peak season. It is found that there were dozens of bags that arrived last time, and they were quickly swept away by the Hong Kong, Shantou, and medicine gangs, and the price reached 31-32 yuan. There is no continuation of arrivals, and the inventory is becoming more depleted. The industry is slightly holding back inventory, and the wild price is 35-36 yuan, and there is still a lack of high-quality goods on the market. According to a survey in the producing area, the inventory has been exhausted, and it is necessary to wait for the new products before they can be transported to Shanghai. However, the date of the new products is still far away, and there may be a shortage in the Shanghai market.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "China Press," optimistic American merchants in Shanghai will hold a U.S. Foreign Trade Week starting on the 21st of this month. Faced with the most severe commercial situation since the opening of treaty ports, they are determined to find the most appropriate solutions. The Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce is in charge of this week's events. According to the Chamber's report, since 1937, Japan's</p>
<p>Trade in Occupied Areas of China Has Increased Sharply,</p>
<p>while trade between China and third countries such as the United States has declined sharply. This Foreign Trade Week is scheduled to conclude on the 27th of this month. American merchants will hold various meetings during the week to consider actions to counter Japan's potential expansion of foreign exchange controls and monopolization of imports and exports at various ports. The American Chamber of Commerce report referred to Guangzhou and Hankou as "dead cities." Regarding</p>
<p>the Yangtze River Basin</p>
<p>commerce, Shanghai's efforts are ultimately futile and unproductive. The Chinese government now relies on supplies from Vietnam, Burma, and the Soviet Union. In 1938, Japan supplied 65% of imports to North China and 46% of imports to all of China, seizing the leading position previously held by American trade. Another report, describing the situation at the end of 1938, stated that Japan implemented a</p>
<p>Yen Bloc</p>
<p>scheme for trade in Manchuria and North China. Apart from Japan, the prospects for trade with China from major countries are bleak. In December 1938, U.S. exports to China were 60% lower than before the war, while Japanese exports to China increased by 31%. In the same month, Chinese exports to the U.S. were 51% lower than in June 1937, while exports to Japan increased by 34%.</p>

<p>Since Ningbo was first bombed on the 28th of last month, it has been continuously ravaged on the 1st, 2nd, 9th, 10th, and 12th of this month, suffering a total of seven devastating attacks. The inner and outer city areas have been almost completely bombed. Commercial transactions can only be conducted at night to avoid the fires of war.</p>
<p>Night Market Shortened</p>
<p>According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the Ningbo night market was previously scheduled from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM. However, starting the day before yesterday, it has been shortened to 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM. The trading time is only two and a half hours. The bleak and desolate scene reflects the situation. It is reported that the prices of daily necessities, vegetables, and food are still rising.</p>
<p>People's Hearts Settling Down</p>
<p>The local people are extremely settled. Although few people are seen during the day, most return in the evening, making the nightlife relatively lively. The administration of various government agencies is proceeding as usual. The police are on duty day and night, taking shifts on time. Inland river transportation is maintained without obstruction or stagnation.</p>
<p>Rice Prices</p>
<p>Because food rice reserves are not abundant, and some are taking the opportunity to hoard for better prices, rice prices are steadily rising, reaching around 20 yuan. Therefore, the authorities are dredging sources and applying pressure to stabilize prices, and cracking down on manipulation, so it is believed that market prices will tend to recover.</p>
<p>Tribute Rice Prepared</p>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, at the request of the people of their hometown, has arranged for 50,000 bags of Saigon rice for relief. It is now known that this rice has been prepared and will be loaded and shipped to Ningbo as soon as ships travel between Shanghai and Ningbo to carry out price stabilization.</p>

In addition, the flagship Izumo is still docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf. There are also the destroyer No. 1 of the First Destroyer Squadron and the destroyer Asuga, which were sent to rescue the Malacca Maru, which ran aground 120 miles from Shanghai.</p>

This is hereby notified." As for Ningbo, only personal medicines and lightweight small packages are accepted. In addition, the service will not resume for counties and cities in eastern Zhejiang such as Shaoxing, Yuhang, Shangyu, and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway such as Jinhua, Zhuji, and Xiaoshan, whether large or small parcels.</p>

<p>It is reported that the first step for the Chinese troops in the Eastern Theater is to clear out the bandits operating under false pretenses, in order to resolve the "false" bandits who have lost their integrity and are seeking opportunities. On the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, from Nanjing to Wuxi, the area has been largely cleared and is under the control of regular troops. Militarily, things are progressing smoothly. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the area from the Qiantang River crossing to Zhapu and Pinghu to Jiashan has also been cleared. The 62nd Division and the 45th Brigade are responsible for Punan and Pudong. Recently, there has been a dispute over the salt factory in Fengxian, leading to large-scale infighting among bandits in Nanhui and Fengxian. Therefore, the 45th Brigade took the opportunity to resolve the situation. From now on, the lineup will be unified under the main body of the Central Army, and the plainclothes teams will be changed to people's self-defense forces to assist. Therefore, the war situation will be fresh.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Fresh Pork Supply Cut Off; Meat Industry Closed Today; 500 Meat Stalls Closed; Awaiting Handling by Concession Authorities <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>After the fresh pork industry declared its position, fresh pork transported to Shanghai has been repeatedly illegally seized at the Hongkou Livestock Market, leading vendors to fear transporting pork to Shanghai. The sources have been cut off. The New Ninghai Slaughterhouse in the International Settlement, the Suxi Slaughterhouse, and the slaughterhouse in the French Concession all stopped slaughtering pigs yesterday morning. More than 2,000 fresh meat stores and stalls in the two concessions have no meat to sell from today and have implemented a market closure, but will not close their doors to maintain the appearance of the concessions. Restaurants have announced that "the supply of fresh pork has been cut off, the meat industry is closed, and there is no meat to offer." As many as 500 meat stalls in the small vegetable markets in the two concessions have voluntarily closed. The fresh pork industry, slaughterhouses, and fresh meat industry are all waiting for the concession authorities to handle the aftermath.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Product Exhibition Opens Today; Yuan Lvdeng Presides Over Opening Ceremony; Public Exhibition of Chinese Goods <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Before the war, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce organized a Product Exhibition Hall, and the Bureau of Social Affairs and the People's Education Center operated a National Goods Exhibition Hall. Due to environmental factors, they have been closed one after another. Distant merchants who want to visit national product samples have no way to inquire, and the general public in the city who want to recognize national products also suffer from not being able to distinguish them. In view of this, the Association decided to hold the Shanghai Product Exhibition, and determined the new Shanghai Market on Jing'an Temple Road and Moore Road as the venue. It is scheduled for three weeks, and a Product Review Committee has been organized to review the exhibits one by one and issue National Goods Honorary Certificates to encourage them.</p>
<p>Exhibited Products</p>
<p>The total number of products exhibited by the Association in this session is no less than 10,000, including clothing, food, and daily necessities necessary for life, such as educational supplies, hygiene products, electrical appliances, textiles, food, shirts, socks, cosmetics, medicines, etc., everything should be available. Especially now that it is summer, the products of major pharmaceutical factories and major pharmacies are the most numerous. Its decisions, such as knitted goods, cotton fabrics, rubber products, etc., are also not small.</p>
<p>List of Manufacturers</p>
<p>No less than a hundred manufacturers participated, with the following brands: Yinfeng Woolen Mill, Sino-French Pharmacy, Sino-Western Pharmacy, New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, Lun Sheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, China Industrial Factory, Kangfu Hongji Weaving Factory, China Button Factory, Huacheng Weaving Factory, Huachang Enji Ink Factory, Da Rong Cotton Weaving and Dyeing Factory, Tiangong Velvet Carpet Factory, Daxin Chemical Factory, Hefeng Enterprise Company Dyeing Factory, Industry and Commerce Battery Factory, Tianran Xianweijing Factory, Jiuzhitang Drugstore, Jing'an Chemical Industry Society, Xinsheng Yarn Factory, Da Shanghai Rubber Factory, Yaohua Peppermint Factory, Huaou Sugar Factory, Yaochang Thread Factory, Shengyang Brothers Mirror Factory, Huafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Zhongdetang Drugstore, Luxing Soap Company, Dazhong Textile Dyeing Factory, Yongxin Underwear Company, Da Lai Weilikeduo Factory, Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Daxin Rubber Factory, Sida Rubber Factory, Boji Pharmacy, China Gelatin Capsule Factory, Jinxing Fountain Pen Factory, Huafu Gold Pen Factory, Guomin Canvas Factory, Guohua Silk Weaving Factory, Hengyisheng Shirts and Socks Factory, Shanghai Shangxian Industrial Society, Jiuming Electric Lamp Factory, Huadong Woolen Mill, Huayang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Liwen Handicraft Society, Suzhou Shen Renshou Erfang Medical Room, Yufeng Weaving Factory, Yonghua Paint Company, China Guowei Industrial Factory, Xinhua Red Lead Factory, Xinguang Underwear Factory, Zhongyi Stationery Company, Jingda Flashlight Factory, Taikang Company, Yonggu Paint Company, Shengxifu Hat Factory, Zhongnan Weimu Company, Hezhong Xiejisheng Belt Factory, Xinhua Rolling Knife Factory, Bazhou Industrial Company, Kaiming Electric Appliance Factory, Yichangfu Weaving Factory, Jincheng Weaving Factory, Zhongfutang Drugstore, Renchang Soap Factory, Daye Woolen Mill.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Continuous Fighting: Pinghu Flights Suspended <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Inland waterway flights from Shanghai to Pinghu, which had just resumed recently, were suspended again yesterday. According to sources in the inland waterway shipping industry, fighting has been taking place in the Pinghu area for days, and the situation is quite tense. A civil vessel that departed the day before yesterday was also stopped and returned. Land and water flights from Shanghai to various parts of western Zhejiang have been completely suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e131">After the Resumption of Navigation on the Wenzhou and Dinghai Lines, Transportation Between Shanghai and Ningbo Can Still Be Maintained; Transportation Between Wenzhou, Dinghai, and Ningbo Continues Normally by Sailing Ships, Launches, and Automobiles <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since Ningbo was repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, the Japanese seem to be more active in the military situation in Ningbo, and all voyages, regardless of nationality, have been prevented from advancing, causing the sudden interruption of transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo. Since the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Dinghai lines have successively resumed shipping, transportation between Wenzhou and Ningbo and between Dinghai and Ningbo can still be achieved by sailing ships, launches, or road vehicles. Therefore, although the direct Shanghai-Ningbo line has not been smooth, it can be indirectly transported through these two lines.</p>
<p>Rumors of Release of German Vessels</p>
<p>The four vessels detained by the Japanese: De Ping of the Italian-Chinese Company, Shangdeng of the German Rulin Trading Company, Tianbao of the Shiyide Trading Company, and Weijin of the Xiangsha Trading Company, now, except for the De Ping of the Italian-Chinese Company, which was released on the evening of the 12th of this month after negotiations by the Italian Consulate and sailed back to Roosevelt Wharf to dock, are under review. The vessel is scheduled to depart from Shanghai tonight directly to Wenzhou, and it is expected that there will be no obstacles in the future. Regarding the three German vessels, Gaodeng, Tianbao, and Qijin, after repeated negotiations by the German Consulate in Shanghai, it is widely rumored in the shipping industry that the Japanese have agreed to release the three vessels. Yesterday morning was a regular holiday and the office was closed. The Japanese naval authorities will be notified to release them in the next day or two. We will decide on the date of sailing to Wenzhou after the release.</p>
<p>Hana Successfully Sailed to Dinghai Twice</p>
<p>The German merchant Yuandong Company's vessel Hana, after the first resumption of shipping on the Shanghai-Dinghai line on the 3rd of this month and returning to Shanghai, was repeatedly postponed because the cargo transportation procedures with Dinghai had not yet been completed. After the various procedures were resolved, the vessel sailed from Shanghai to Dinghai for the second time on the 12th of this month. It was inspected by Japanese warships during the voyage and then sailed to Dinghai. According to a report from the company last night, the Hana is expected to return to Shanghai today. It is scheduled to depart at 4:00 pm, and the voyage is going smoothly.</p>
<p>Passengers and Goods on Shanghai-Wenzhou Line Must Be Guaranteed</p>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, the authorities have allowed the resumption of the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, but in order to prevent espionage, traitors, smuggling of private goods, and the export of local goods, the restrictions on passengers and goods are very strict. It has been decided to handle it in accordance with the previously established navigation regulations. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Wenzhou must have a guarantee from a local well-established merchant. Because explosive devices are buried in the port, ships entering the port must be guided by a pilot. No loading or unloading of passengers and goods is allowed before inspection.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Dinghai Passengers Limited to Merchants</p>
<p>Although the resumption of the Shanghai-Dinghai line once encountered problems due to the authorities' strict prohibition of passengers, it was then facilitated by the shipping industry, and proper merchants with proper guarantees were allowed to board the vessel. The German merchant Hana returned from Dinghai to Shanghai on the 14th, and the passengers on board were also limited to proper merchants. It will continue to sail on the 15th.</p>
