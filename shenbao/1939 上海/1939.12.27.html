<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國總統與教皇之作為</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福氏於耶誕節前宣佈，任命戴樂氏爲駐敎京梵蒂岡之個人代表；賦以使命日，謀與天主敎合作，爲世界和平而平行努力力；同時，爲聯合各敎人士，致力於恢復和平及援助苦難之人羣計，對於美國之基督敎與猶太敎領袖，亦函邀合作。敎皇庇護士十二世於忻然接受美總統個人代表之餘，即於耶誕前夕，爲呼籲和平而演說：指斥侵略暴行，謂異日必爲上天所誅；復提示建樹公允和平之基本原則五項：（一）國家不分大小强弱，均應保有生存與獨立之權·無論何國，不可因本國意願生存而將他國判處死刑；（二）各國協謀循序減縮軍備；（三）改革國際組織·保障各項條約，（四）務以善意考慮各國各民族各少數民族之正當要求與需要，務以和平方式，予以滿足，遇必要時，修正現行條約；（五）各國族曁其領袖，務須顧及合乎天理之簡單而不可動搖之原則，顧及人類之品位。在三週之前，本月上旬，吾人鑒於國際之三組戰爭，嘗謂人類亟須一德一心，羣策羣力，使錯誤及時糾正，使罪惡終止演進；嘗斷言於任何方面，若放任當前現象之自然發展，終於自貽伊戚；爰希望曾爲和平努力之義大利君臣，美國總統，荷蘭此利時二國王，敎皇，集各方最大之力量，促各組戰爭之總解決；不獲總解決，亦應獎勵任何組之主動作戰者，率先接受合理解決之建議。今者，美總統與敎皇又有所發動矣；吾人竊願此非點綴耶誕佳節之福音，務使此爲對於人羣切實之厚惠。</p>
<p>不能限制戰爭，則戰爭必延長而擴大；不能懲儆侵略，則侵略必以不妨效允而變本加厲；不能使正義與和平之呼籲獲致有效之後果、則正義和平必以每一次呼籲之無效而每一次說明其眞理實現之更渺茫，亦即反證暴戾恣唯之不必有所顧忌而更助長其兇燄。凡此惡行，不進則退，不退則進之嬗遞，旣形成必然之方式，千古之定律。自一九三一年九一八之瀋陽烽火，以迄本月中旬英德軍艦之交戰於美洲中立海面；自反對帝國主義，扶掖弱小民族之黎明運動，以迄勾結强暴，巧取豪奪之機會主義；自國聯盟的之下，國聯組織之中，企圖以詭辯自全，以權術取容，以迄公然撕毀各種約章，肆意塗抹國際輿圖；凡此演化之跡象，無不愈演愈劣，愈化愈惡；事實如鐵，無一人可予否認。夫由漸而來者，豈自昔迄今，悉爲有計畫之行動？蓋最初旣未能防患未然，繼之復未能防微杜漸，於是傳染蔓延，相率爲惡，遂至萬分惡劣如今日！雖然，今日猶非惡劣萬分之止境也。誠使各方裏足觀望，放任當前現象之自然發展；誠使美國總統羅斯福氏與敎皇庇護士十二世近日之云謂，僅以點綴耶誕佳節；則不但明年耶誕之際，世界悽慘景象必視今年爲廣爲酷，即明日亦將視今爲烈。</p>
<p>於此美總統與敎皇呼籲之後，吾人有欲呼籲於美總統與敎皇之前者：公等擁有世界物質上與精神上之卓越權威者也，對於正義與和平，具有信念之眞誠；於所信念，其勿視如哲理，其更秉此眞誠，以責任觀念，以積極行動，使所信念發揚光大而具體實現之乎？吾人固知彼瘋在者旣喪其理智，復失其常態，自未可遽望和平與正義僅由權威者登高一呼而智愚賢不肯盡作相同之合理響應。吾人固知具有卓越權威者，非即可得而左右一切，主宰一切。然國際爭端之解決，其關於子目與技術者，有待公允衡量，從容擬制；茲猶白紙，無以徵詢兩造之如何主張，徵詢兩造之能吾融洽。其關於基本原則者，則可就爭端中之兩造而問之也。其樂於接受原則者，進而協謀排難解紛之子目與技術；勗兩造以善意，期兩造之公允。其悍然不願接受基本原則者，是自絕於文明之人羣，亦可見其萬惡而不悔；鑒於變本加厲之可虞，自是正義和平之公敵；美總統與敎皇而未能遽予征伐，然發揮卓越之權威，自物質上精神上使之絕對隔離，母放任之爲文明人羣之患；此則對於正義和平具有真誠信念者，在責任觀念之下，乃為義不容辭之行動乎？此而不為，信念之謂何？真誠之謂何？一部分人類已在水深火熱之中，其他亦在岌岌可危之列；吾人殷願無一國族暨其領袖而竟不接受公允之基本原則，然就交戰中之各國而問以是否樂於接受原則，是美總統與敎皇亟應作爲之於今茲者也！</p>

<h3>浙西華軍流動陣綫　京軍收穫極大戰果　日軍已成強弩之末</h3>
<p>金華通信、浙西沃野的冲積平原、夙稱魚米之鄕、富庶之區、然今已有十二縣半一市淪陷、如以杭州市棄守的日子算起、（杭市淪陷於民國二十六年十二月二十四日、爲浙西失土中最後的暫時放棄的一塊國土、）到今天巳經兩年了、</p>
<p>兩年來、以東戰傷的兩軍正面陣地論、左起蕪湖荻港、右迄富陽餘杭、中路以宣城爲終點、這陣綫不特未有變動、且有若干地方、日軍反縮短防綫、單以浙西論、富陽·餘杭·的日軍、都有若干外圍據點被迫後撤、這證明中國抗戰兩年以來，日軍非但擴大戰果是不可能、即圖保持「面」的佔領、亦屬難事、强弩之末、確不能穿魯縞了、</p>
<p>游擊戰之登　時期</p>
<p>杭州淪陷後、日軍止於錢江北岸、隔水與華軍對峙、以餘杭·富陽·爲左右外圍、藉以鞏固杭州、這時期、兩軍都致力內部的整頓、雙方相安無事、三個月內、前綫無大戰事、僅有稀落砲戰、以點綴沉寂之空氣而已、二十七年三月間、華軍第七集團軍總部·及浙省軍事當局、對發動浙西游擊戰、商妥計劃、先後派隊北渡、領導地方武力、分佈於海鹽·海寗·平湖·嘉興等地區、浙西處女的游擊戰、於焉展開、每一條公路的每一點、時常遭華軍破壞、各處河道、亦均遮斷、並派隊越過鐵道綫、控制滬杭路兩側、不斷予以襲擊、五月十五日的攻克海鹽縣城、可以說在浙西游擊戰史上揭開了新的一頁、厥後、海鹽屢失屢得、這「游擊城」更成了浙江人士特別注目的一個縣城、</p>
<p>綜計上年一年間、激烈的游擊戰有二百多次、各地殲滅日軍共有九千之衆、滬杭鐵道。京杭國道·嘉湖公路·平乍公路：等路基路面破壞達二百多次、炸燬橋樑五十餘座、擊沉及奪獲汽艇輪船八九十隻、擊毀及奪獲的汽車五十餘輛、截獲鋼砲數十門、　重機槍三十餘挺、浙西除京杭國道西側外、都是平原地帶、港汶錯綜、河流縱橫、是不十分適宜打游擊的地帶所以有上述的戰績、也可認爲十分滿意、這是英勇將士血肉所換來、這成就終於奠定了浙西淤擊區的根據、</p>
<p>游擊區之新的姿態</p>
<p>浙西上年一年間的游擊戰、由發　時期而轉入第二個時期、實力漸趨强大、但尙有不少缺點、亟待加强、因此軍事當局決心整頓、作戰的隊伍、分批調回南岸、整理補充、另一方面、浙西行署成立後、對若干「老刀牌」的地方游擊隊、也下了決心、收編整訓、使其成爲勁旅、浙西面目、至此煥然一新、</p>
<p>本年春間起、華方新的軍事動作又開始了、大部生力軍向日軍後方挺進、正面錢江南岸以迄富春江南岸之綫、及京杭國道西側之綫、實力較前更爲雄厚、四月間、京杭國道南段武康·吳興間、屢挫日軍銳鋒、六月間、湖墅之役、日僞震驚、九月間、先後炸毀滬杭路兵車兩列、日軍死傷狼藉、同月間、蘇邊境之役、生擒僞綏靖副司令謝志俊、十月間、衝入杭州城、獲得赫赫戰果、十一月間、吳興·崇德·桐鄕·反包圍戰、獲得成功、這些都是本年來十一個月中較大的戰役、其餘小規模的游擊戰、每天都有、</p>
<p>在本年過去十一個月的游擊戰中、以上月間衝進杭州城之役、曁十一月間浙西反包圍戰之役、在戰略上和戰術上講、都有若干的成功、如衝進杭州城之役、各部隊能相互呼應、密切合作、再如浙西反包圍戰之役、華軍避免內綫作戰、而作圍棋式的游擊戰、衝出重圍、採取反包圍形勢、更得滬杭鐵道東南側及京杭國道西側華軍的呼應、浙東部隊、且北渡襲擊杭州、使日軍到處被圍、腹背受敵、以致於崩潰、</p>
<p>日軍活躍鍛羽而歸</p>
<p>從上年三月到本年十一月、日軍在浙西採用的所謂掃蕩戰」、不知若干次、其中規模較大的、有上年三月間安吉·孝豐·長興之役、日方動員一萬人、結果被華軍斬獲二千餘名、八月初、嘉興·海鹽之役、日軍動員五六千、遭遇華軍嚴重打擊、結果僅得了一座海鹽空城、但不久又爲華軍乘虛攻克、十月間、浙西日軍「全面掃蕩、動員兵四五千、華軍却分二十三路反掃蕩、給予日軍以一個强硬的答復、本年三月間、日軍又「全面掃蕩一、動員兵力的五千、經華軍痛擊被迫退、十一月間、吳興·崇德·桐鄕之役、動員兵力四五千、圖一舉「殲滅」華軍某部、詎被華軍反包圍、激戰七日、鍛羽而歸、</p>

<h3>控制戰事唯一武器　英煤出口抬頭（上）德煤無法溝通運輸口道　美煤輸往南美獎勵出口</h3>
<p>— 荃</p>
<p>歐洲戰事既肇端、德國戰胜波蘭以後、適造成恢復英帝國煤塊出口貿易之絕好機會、往歲、英煤出口、無法與波蘭德國相頡頏、据煤業出口商談、依據經濟新聞所述、德輪之絕跡海上、即為不列顛之機會、僅波羅的海航道、猶復任令駛行、德國國內、既需要孔殷、而陸路運輸又甚困難、故德國之煤塊出口、勢必大受影響、</p>
<p>中立國家、對煤之企求、現咸存過份之奢望、蓋煤為戰時之武器、於是、無形中造成英煤出口機會、英國一躍為各國中心賣主矣、同時、英國尤切望將戰時出品之煤、在南美各國佔一席地、以饜需要者之渴望、此乃英國最近出口貿易政策也、第二次世界大戰猝發、英法聯合陣綫與德國交惡、雙方消耗鉅額之煤斤、用於戰爭、德煤之出口、於一九三二年輸出額為一八·三一三·〇〇〇噸、降至今日、已步跌至二九·六四〇·〇〇〇噸、其中仰給於德國者、以法意兩國為最鉅、歷往數年中、一九三七年為八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸、與一九三二年之四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸相差一倍、其銷於意國者一九三七年為七·九三〇·〇〇〇噸、與一九三二年之一·四四〇·〇〇〇噸相較、增加尤夥、竟超出五倍以上、德煤行銷於其他較小之市場、其最顯著者、為加拿大與南美聯邦各國、此乃未可忽視者、自一九三二年以至去歲、德煤銷於加拿大者、占三八八·〇〇〇噸、輸往南美聯邦者、總數亦在九六三·〇〇〇噸、波蘭煤塊出口貿易、在最近數年、已逐漸滋長中、且煤之產額、已蔚為壯觀、一九三八年、波煤出口、總數達一一·六八七·〇〇〇、其中半數、几盡流入向為英國煤市場之斯干地那維半島各國、及法意兩國、波蘭煤斤、在法意兩國之輸出額中、以一九三二年與一九三八年為最鉅、英國此際、反望塵莫及、趨於回跌、七年之中、由於船隻貨運之增加、德波兩國之輸出額、無形中增加近九百萬噸、英煤則降貶至五百五十萬噸、</p>
<p>一九三八年、為德國煤塊出口貿易最不景氣一年、德波兩國之煤、其輸入法國者、僅七百萬噸、減少之主要原因、為英煤佔有所致、下在滋長之波蘭煤塊市場、亦幾為英煤所席捲、波蘭煤之出口貿易、—在貿易條約範圍以外—波煤產額近年已蒸蒸日上、一九三四年產額四三六·〇〇〇噸、（或為歐洲煤總額二又二分之一、）迨一九三八年、波蘭之產煤輸出額、已稓至一·八三九·〇〇〇噸、（或為歐洲煤額百分之一一·四）、同年、英煤反低落至三百萬噸、最近、英國對法國之煤斤貿易、緊步德波后塵侵入、我人所知者、英煤鍼有廣袤之進步、逐德波煤塊於門外、</p>
<p>煤在意大利、關係殊為單純、近年來意國國內之路漢（Ruhr）與雪莉斯（Silesian）兩區產煤額頗多、由船隻裝運至瑞士以南各地、溯自二次世界大戰爆發以後、意大利已不復裝運、陷於停滯狀態、其停滯原因為（一）因瑞士不允許供給鐵路假道、（二）因無德國運貨車供作運輸、（三）因德國本身有存煤足以自給之故、由於波蘭國內運輸困難、德國雖佔有波蘭半壁、但、對波蘭之煤礦、至今猶不能加以開採、另一原因、殆德國欲盡其最大努力、不使煤類出口、保持其固有原料、用以自供、其不得已而出口者、亦僅換取其必需品而已、英意兩國之貿易談判、刻正在進行、英國南華爾斯地方之煤、希冀大量銷入意國、期訂互惠條約、雙方談判進行、尚稱順利、</p>
<p>同時、据報告、西班牙國、在過去并不需要外來之煤塊、但自經內戰以後、西班牙迫切希求外國供給煤斤、於是英國又為傾銷之大好機會矣、</p>
<p>至於波羅的海沿岸國家之煤市場、頗形暗淡與脆弱、使德國於戰事發生後、無所顧忌英法陣綫、德國控有波羅的海、向占絕對優勢、自戰事猝發、對於煤·鐵·食料及戰時軍糈、彼等足可儘量貢獻於德國、且自波蘭與德銜接後、益使德國躊躇滿志、（未完）</p>

<p>米市自前朝雲南起義紀念休業一天後、昨則一般店舖添購頗多、早市見內地來源依然不多、客販亦謀脫售、一時交易殊旺、仍以洋米爲大宗、粳尖等國米祇屬點綴而巳、在此暢銷之際、市面步步提升、但以市上籌碼亦豐、若西貢米早開三十八元、後雖逐喊至三十八元半、卒難做開、收盤仍爲三十八元、較前僅加二三角、碎米初爲三十三元三角、後至三十三元半、先後計增三五角、　羅米收盤爲三十八元半、東京砶米特別爲三十五元半、次至三十四元半、其市况與曲貢米相仿、至於厚薄粳所開者、厚粳僅蘇同貨、若同里及黎盛粳悉居限盤爲四十元、靑泗高薄亦開四十元、楓嘉等早晚稻高開四十元、中段者爲三十九元半、蘆尖眞特別開四十元、中次照別、羊尖三十九元半、三十九元、客尖則因東京砶尖巳至三十四五元、若以三十三元之限價脫出、是誠虧耗有三四元之巨、所以一般貨主小認經售、致未有交易、變元去路頗廣、惟市貨無多、市色獨俏、計開四十三四元、較升半元左右、統計全市成交不下七八千包、市上囤戶絕跡、全屬正常交易、故人心雖佳、市面僅有三五角之上落耳、不過內地來源、長此以往、久告斷絕、倘不亟早疏通、祇賴一些洋米、蹉跎下去、則滬米前途猶堪深虞、是則從速交涉、恢復來源爲急要也、</p>
<p>客秈昨日略有江北秈數百包抵埠、惟貨方因江北秈成本合到三十五元以上、曾有三十六元之喊價、一說暗盤巳經多次成交、並經檢舉而曾受到警吿者、惟市上低次各秈仍有三十三元限價之售開、然大多居奇不肯脫手云、</p>
<p>洋米昨有太古重慶輪裝到萬餘包、其他零票由香港轉申者亦有多起、惟做後店作鄉客需胃均旺、各米開價後步步上升、西貢　維高檔均至三十八元半、高碎米亦至三十四元、而原包路現貨步漲至四十六元四角、比之上週則現貨市石漲五六角，原包漲近一元、洋米邇日逐開逐高、故當局亦有限價之擬議云、</p>
<h3>粉麥平淡</h3>
<p>昨日現粉市况、無大上落、二號紛仍站八元七角原盤、客帮進胃亦殊平淡、成交僅二萬餘包、回籠貨進出兩乏、聞日廠粉鳳凰牌本月份以月底期屆、頗有軋多形勢、價開八元一角三分、一月份暫居定局、</p>
<p>前昨小麥來源略有點綴、連日到貨的有數千包、大都上棧待價而沽、各廠對於原料需要不貪、行囤亦然、惟貨方堅持如故、聞廠辦的二三千包、最高價仍須十五元、中次稍別、市形呆頓、</p>
<h3>黃豆囤胃又活</h3>
<p>黃豆市况在油價無過辱之情形下、一般囤戶辦胃活潑、故行市雖少猛烈變動、然其潛勢因來源不湧、致脚地頗覺堅硬、昨日統計做開江北豆二百餘包、價爲十六元、丁家州豆一千餘包、價自十七元五角至十八元、南京豆七八車、價自十六元至十七元一角、及蕪湖豆五六百包、價自十七元五角至十八元、去路出口不動、囤胃占四分之三、次爲本街云、</p>
<h3>證券　內債穩定</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、因經過兩日停市後、和平空氣尙未全絕、故人心較堅、但以外匯及金子尙在停市期內、人心渙散、交易乃亦極爲淸閒、檯面因客戶不動、故升降亦極平常、且以某金融界有貨出脫、漲勢乃遭壓迫而趨於平、上午以協大賣出較湧、聯益三開亦有脫手、鴻康鼎康順泰及散戶買進、市價略堅、午後、鴻大茂太又有需要、爲數不多、市况平平、結果除丁種未有做開外、餘則再好二角、乙種無升降、成交總數共計的三十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交商務印書館股三十股、價爲六十八元正、</p>
<h3>疋頭　南洋棉貨　求之上海</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市南洋帮實銷暢達、國內浙贛幫及天津幫需胃亦有展開、而本街同業及囤戶搜辦頗力、致市價趨勢堅昂、白貨細布細斜粗布漲每疋一二角、漂布印染布漲一角至五角、英商怡和綸昌二家出品、售盤最佳、粗布漂布等續漲二角半至五角、國外暹邏新加坡等地採辦紅洋標漂布等貨一萬餘疋、浙贛帮辦漂布細布細斜一百餘件、津帮辦斜紋府綢近百件、本街成交粗細布漂布斜紋六百餘件</p>
<p>東布　昨以洋行封關市塲休業、而同業因天津帮採辦中下檔細布五百餘件、市氣昂騰、喊盤頗高、細布售價較上週提升每疋五六角、細斜三四角、十二磅龍頭細布、本街交易步開步增、至晚市收盤爲廿二元一角、趨勢殊堅、</p>
<h3>紗花　假後紗花　趨勢尙佳　行情堅昂</h3>
<p>紗市益覺穩靜、趨勢尙佳、但實際銷路尙屬不暢、惟一般同業心理、因廠方成本關係、不能盈餘、所以一般手中頭襯寬裕者、對於紗價不看小、後來收進幾百包、於是現紗生意雖則沉寂不起、然人心依然挺秀、市價反見上升、就大勢測之、基礎固堅、然實需仍呆、十分大漲面亦將受牽制也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因外棉及匯票均在封關中、而繼續停市、故人氣和平、同業心思大都皆看硬、二十支雙馬開價爲七百三十五元、與上日午後市價相彷、後經多頭了結、微跌二元、但某投機商預料市面要開高盤、突來買進一二百包、檯面尤轉緊俏至七百三十六元收盤、查半日成交統計一千九百五十包行情二十支雙馬漲四元、天女漲一元、雙地球漲二元、永安廠開出三二支、特金城十五包、價爲九百三十五元、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、同行一、六三〇　內地　一九〇香港　一三〇　統計一、九五〇</p>
<p>本棉交易仍屬靜寂、廠方只包未辦、同行成交亦不及昔日之踴躍、大都在此陰陽歷年關之際、準備結束、經營心思稍懈、但行情尙昂一二元之譜、蘇北來源亦紛紛不斷、在此封關幾日中、通花共計到九千八百七十一包、常陰沙二千一百八十一包、茲將現棉情形列左、北太花　一六四·〇〇　同行進三〇包火機草　一五七·〇〇　又一四五包　又　一六〇·〇〇　又　四二〇包通州花　一七〇·〇〇　又　一〇〇包　又　一六八·〇〇　通成進三〇〇包</p>
<h3>金融　金市略疲　飾金未動</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤、暗盤市况、塲中因逢耶誕節封關期內、仍無市面、惟今日起照常開市、至塲外暗盤已有行市做開、據聞趨勢尙穩、某錢兌業門市貿價、肯出四千一百四十五元、嗣因市上突有中日和平謠傳、人心是以轉疲、證券帮代多戶出籠百數十兩、價遂由四千一百四十五元、步小至四千一百三十元、其中乃銀樓帮吸進居多、最後午刻四千二百三十二三元、尙有賣戶、較上週末午收約小三四元、</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、鎭日未更、大同行仍懸四百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元、</p>
<h3>貼現不動</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、每千元之貼價仍在三十八九元間、終爲三十八元半、與上週六相同、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛一角五分亦平云、</p>
<h3>糖市　赤砂小五角</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平平、無甚上落、公會劃盤、二四粗白現貨本棧五十八元半、外棧新到五十八元五角至三角、老貨五十八元、轉口貨四十八元、太古車白B嘜東棧五十八元、西棧五十八元半、CW嘜五十八元二角、CX嘜五十七元七角、DY嘜五十六元半、東棧五十六元、HX嘜西棧五十六元、H嘜車赤四十四元半、荷赤四十六元至四十五元半、均小五角、本一號白及一號冰俱呌原價、國糖有潮幫開出足上冰數十包、五十六元半、奇白五十餘包、五十元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　泉泡圓來源將阻</h3>
<p>泉州桂圓、據貨主電訊、因存底漸薄、辦價又升五元、而來往輪運、又爲某方阻擱、來源防斷、故此間號方前到之貨、今明日可開盤、市價看升云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　海峯煤現貨多</h3>
<p>海峯白煤、近日來現貨突見充溢、日昨又有九百餘噸到申、行囤戶手中大都有貨以致引起浮戶塞出、暗盤朱免遜色、海峯塊煤每噸一百二十元、囤戶棧單、便官兩三元不等、本街門莊、篩塊一百二十八元、每擔六元四角云、</p>
<h3>統計　物價之變動</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>十·十一月份</p>
<p>十月份與十一月份上海物價的漲風，比之九月份，殊見减輕了許多。原因是以前所漲價的商品，都是過份上漲，如若再跟着上漲，無疑地是要受到消費者的遺棄了。所以這兩月份的漲價，是比前月份爲少。這裏，就十月份和十一月份的漲價情形來分說於下：</p>
<p>十月份漲價共計六十六起，也就是漲價的單位六十六家，較，月份的一百三十七起，减少十　起。在這六十六起漲價商品類別，可分飲食，日用品，衣着，醫藥，燭箔，電氣，裝飾。文化印刷，化妝品，行旅，土木，特種，包裝等十三類就中以日用品十四起爲最多；佔着第一位；醫藥九起第二位；飲食和行旅各八起第三位；衣着和金屬電氣各六起第四位；文化印刷和土木各四起　五位；燭箔和特種各二起第六位；而以化妝品，包裝，裝</p>
<p>各一起殿末位。（未完）</p>

<h3>本屆大學　統一招生考試概況　（五十）</h3>
<p>（三）升學指導的需要　我們以統考學生志願集中的現象來看、一方面因爲適合時代及國家的需要、一方面却顯然的缺乏升學的指導選擇好的學校，當然是一般學生普遍的心理、而選擇院系、却每多與其學力及志趣不稱、去年統考的結果、志願工科的學生特多、故錄取亦多、但以學科興趣及成績不佳、一年期滿、呈請轉院轉系者、不在少數、今年的情形、大致也是相同、我們從許多未錄取的學生中間、發見許多學生的成績與其所志願的學系是不適合的、例如數學成績是零分，理化分數也很差、而所塡的三個志願却都是工科、有的英文在五分以下、而所塡的志願却是外國文學系、有的化學爲零分、而所塡的志願却是化學系、有地史地成績特差、而所塡的志願却爲歷史系、試問數學是零分、理化成績又很壞、如何能學習工科、外國文大差、如何能學習外國文學、化學是零分、又如何能讀化學系、這種學生、他在報考之前、顯然沒有把他自己的能力先行估量、而隨意塡寫志願、還有少數學生、他所選擇的學校所塡的院系、根本在那個學校就沒有設置、他志願學校院系的有無、都沒有弄淸楚、如何還能辨別某校某系的優良與吾、這樣、可見中學生升學指導、確實是必要的、今後中學方面、對於學生的個性、興趣學力、志願、因應多做個別的調查和詳細的指導、就是大學及敎育行政機關方面、亦應注意這個問題、多從事於大學內容的介紹、編成專書、使升學學生不致徬徨　所適從、因爲選擇不愼、志趣不合、或學力不相當、在學生個人是徬徨無措、甚或誤入歧途、而在國家却是一種很大的損失、</p>
<p>（四）各項試務的改進　各項試務及考試辦法、照兩年來統考的結果來看、可算是已達到相當嚴密與圓滿的地步、但是事實上仍有許多地方尙須加以改進、第一、爲閱卷評分問題、試題今年算是統一了、敎育部對於送題監試、可算是已盡了最大的努力、可以說統考制度的確立、就是建立在統一試題的這個基礎上、但試題雖是統一、閱卷評分還是不能統一、因此、計分的寬嚴、分數的調整、仍不能不採用、集中閱卷、我在第二節裏巳經說過、因爲種種事實上的困難、難以辨到、不得不採用分區閱卷的辦法、閱卷是考試最重要的一件事、閱卷人選要愼重、問卷及評分標準、還要加以縝密的規定、照現行的辦法、是由命題委員預擬各題評分標準、各科試卷、由閱卷委員分題評閱、分別給分、方法是很好、不過標準還可加以細密的分析、最好由命題委員製成一套標準答案、規定答出全題者給滿分、理論對而方法不對者給若干分、方法對一部分、能答出某項範圍或特點者給若干分、每一題目的各種答法、可詳細的分析、每題各部分的分數之和爲一題的總分、各題分數之和爲一科的總分、不過統考到底不是標準測騐、如欲求其與標準測騐的客觀化、是不可能的、但分析愈密、總可以獲得比較客觀的結果、第二、志願與分發問題、照統考方法的規定、考生可報考三個志願、以第二組所屬院系為第一志願者、得以第三組所屬院系為其他志願、報考第一三組者、不能以第二組各系為志願、理由就是第二組所考的數學較為高深、並且物理化學均爲必試、所以兼考第三組是不成問題的、不過加試一門生物學或外國史地罷了、</p>
<h3>難教院定元旦　行新屋落成禮</h3>
<p>上海救濟難民兒童敎養院、成立迄今、已歷年餘、該院自本年九月間在武定路二五八弄九九號建造新屋二十八幢、遷入新址敎養後、收容難實、現已增至五百十七名、經該院董事長袁履登院長陸文韜、總幹事袁鳴鈞、副總幹事俞鏡淸諸氏、苦心籌劃、院務逐漸發展、故成績卓著、該院定於元旦日、舉行新屋落成典禮、並將所徵集之書畫數千件、公開展覽五天、凡持有書畫禮券者、均得憑券抽籤領件、</p>
<h3>教育簡報</h3>
<p>昨爲治中女中校慶紀念、假靑年會聚餐、到師生校友一百餘人、由校長陳乃文報吿辦學之經過、後有校董蔣竹莊、單眉叔演說、聞該校定一月二十五日招考新生、</p>
<p>華光業餘夜中學改組爲戲劇專校、聘定各系主任、下學期起成立、靑年會少年部訓練兒童領袖促進德智體羣四育、影星黃柳霜組設現代電影話劇專校、定明年元旦開學、貧兒失學救濟所考試敎員完竣、於一月份揭曉、建樹中連女子部曁附小、前日上午舉行四週校慶紀念、</p>
<p>失敗檢討</p>
<p>華聯昨日之慘敗、雖曰球　不通、亦非偶然、西聯隊實力之堅强、有目共賞、老將考斯泰坐鎮中央、八面威風、海列遜開墨爾之兩衛、不啻鐵閘兩座、勞巴斯托夫雖吿缺席、福恩配入、仍極活躍、黃毛弗拉塞滿塲飛奔、但華聯如能整軍迎戰、亦未始無有希望、後衛主將李義臣不幸中俄一戰、受傷不能出席、孫錦順退居李位、孫非素習、兼以黃克厚又較軟弱、於是球源源從此道而來、守旣如此、攻亦較差、前鋒五將、必須有一靈魂、如此則統率三軍、指揮若定、戴麟經孫錦順李義臣、三位統帥、竟病的病、傷的傷、後調的後調、阿奎雖佳、尙非統帥之才、兼以開賽不久、阿奎即受傷離塲、以此陣勢安得不敗、惟敗得如此慘者、則出乎二萬人之意料也、寇爾大使開球　（張洪攝）</p>
<p>登塲慘劇</p>
<p>華聯向太陽進攻、已屬不利、實亦上塲二分鐘內、連失二球之重要原因之一、英大使寇爾爵士開球、向西聯陣地一撥、入考斯泰脚下、傳湯默遜、湯沿邊來犯直達禁地、爲莊友仁阻出、黃克厚不愼於中綫處犯規、開墨爾主踢任意、三十碼外向球鬥直射、福恩躍起一頂、素必高雙目爲陽光照射發花、以致接救落空、球着地彈入門內、時離啟賽僅一分鐘、中綫開球、福恩帶球猛撲、提足叩門、莊友仁臥地攔空、必高又重蹈覆　、球直　網窩、兩分鐘內、華聯連失二球、四座失色、十五分鐘、幼良得祺祥接濟、盤入切中、文奎迎頭頂去、被撞暈倒、扶出塲外、華聯遂以十人迎戰、形勢更趨不利、</p>
<p>一連四球</p>
<p>華軍反攻、義良派司秋亭、秋亭發射、竟中開墨爾身上彈回、球又入華軍陣地、廿八分鐘、派爾殺過孫錦順、孫倒地、福恩於廿碼處猛射、竟然入網、成三比零、五分鐘後、文奎勉强登塲、未能恢復常態、華軍得許重入、精神復振、文奎擺渡祺祥、球向右傳、幼良鈎射、威利托出、幼良雄心不死、挑送門前、文奎一頂再射、時威利已趕出、衆料必中、安知竟中橫木彈下、斗文搭住再射、亦成畫餅、上半時結束前二分半鐘、友仁救球、反鈎成角球、湯默遜中開、球撲門飛來、由門柱彈入、西聯遂凈勝四球</p>
<p>苦戰無效</p>
<p>再戰聲起、華聯以許文奎傷重、不能出陣、祇得仍以十人上塲、同時秋亭與斗文互易位置、西聯撥球再襲、球爲華軍所得、秋亭傳遞斗文、斗文用力猛蹴、仍雞破威利之關、祗得望門興嘆、華軍堅苦奮鬥、八分鐘、斗文不負衆望、得幼良鈎送、於二十五碼外、低射中鵠、淸晰美觀、掌聲雷動、奪回一球、免吃鴨蛋、旣而派爾傳中、義良阻成角球、派爾開來、錦順阻擋落空、球撞門柱不動、幸　　、由必高拾起　出　十五分鐘、傑姆踢任意球、麥克拉德頂傳派爾、麥克福恩連接射門、均中必高、最後終被福恩射入、又咸五比二、繼之幼良得祺祥協助，反身怒掃、球出如矢、威利接而搖動、惜未滑下、反被於十九分鐘、再建一切、添成半打、後五分鐘幼良偷度陳倉、秋亭穿針引綫、斗文力叩、威利接而復失、幼良衝進破網、六對二大局於此奠定、</p>

<h3>給「新郵人」一個安慰</h3>
<p>— 強弓</p>
<p>聽說供職郵局海關銀行是三個「鑲金邊的飯碗」，新郵人及其他新郵人等，這回考取郵政，除「因此自度「分欣奮」之外，的的確確要算在失業羣繼續增加而且被生活的狂瀾冲擊着以至逼迫生靈去塗炭的上海看來，不能不認爲一個可以額首慶幸的遭遇。</p>
<p>新郵人在呼籲聲中，曾經提出『選人郵局辦事者』與「派至郵政局者』，兩相比較，待遇不平，繼之來了一個不平之鳴，這誠然是一個此時此地依賴薪給過活的階層中所不能不據理力爭的問題。</p>
<p>不過郵政局及儲匯局均直屬郵政管理局，而郵政管理局又為交通部直轄機關；則其行政與人員的銓選一層，當然著有專條，要不至無故有所變更而分軒輊以薄待新郵人者也。如果依照銓選的規條，按法定的程序而晋升或叙俸，則不但新郵人所應凛遵，即舊郵人也得黽勉服從。</p>
<p>大槪在一個政府直轄機關下服務——尤其是像郵局向來對於考績嚴明，秉公銓選的精神下，一個新職員是用不着怎樣去懷疑的，况且原函中曾經有「郵政當局聲稱無分軒輊，同爲國家效勞……」云云，則更可以鼓勵新郵人的公忠服務了！即使當局一時權益，容或稍加似乎不至於對付人或對付「幼友一的問題。這一點是儘可放心的。</p>
<p>問題就是出在是否被派到內地去服務一層。大多數的人，都喜歡在上海服務的，一聽到　赴內地，就有點談虎色變的模樣。有許多固然爲了高堂倚閭的緣故；也有許多爲了妻孥怕吃長途勞頓的緣故；然而「普通客飯每月亦須六七十元，加之租屋費用每月亦要二三十元。』這未免過甚其辭。即或有之，亦不是內地處處皆然</p>
<p>實在說，內地去好，內地比上海好，內地雖然生活高，但有許多當地的土產，並不怎樣高；老百姓尚且過活下去，難道生活都市的人就不能往內地過活嗎？况且郵政當局，他也决不會不顧往內地工作人員的「含辛茹苦」的。所以希望新郵人等，還是靜候局方派遣罷。呼籲何爲？</p>
<h3>本館同事　黃品堂先生</h3>

<p>病前三兩刻，態度安閒，猶與我侈談中外局。交久十餘年，風雲變幻，可知人祇有去來時。</p>
<h3>都會的窮巷</h3>
<p>— 水沫</p>
<p>（一）「白面犯」</p>
<p>又是一個「白面」犯死亡！巷子裏的住戶看得習常了的，沒有聲喟嘆，沒有皺一皺眉頭；每天都有一個或是幾個，吸白面的流浪漢的死屍躺着，臘黃的臉，削瘦得木柴樣的身子，……直到藍色的車子把屍體載走。</p>
<p>用不着追問死的病源，他的身世就够證明了的，老是那麼一樁遭遇，——死者沒有職業，平日晚間也沒住址地蜷睡在巷子裏，有一天病了，他不能去討，也不能去偷，也就不能換得那生活泉源底「白面」，他能够忍住飢餓，可一天缺不了它，癮發作了，掙扎和痙攣一回，生命也就了結的了。</p>
<p>（二）陽光</p>
<p>窮巷裏少有陽光。</p>
<p>這古老陳舊的建築物，還算是樓房，灰色的屋，石子舖的狹路；支持房屋的木架，已枯朽了，牆上的白堊，一堆堆地剝落，屋的輪廓明顯的傾斜，顫巍巍地老像快坍的模樣，房東不去修理它，巷裏住房的性命，就像螞蟻一樣賤。</p>
<p>屋裏一間房，就用木板像豆腐乾一樣隔成幾間，樓梯下也成間房，祇要好擱舖；每家都這樣，一間矮矮的樓房，住上許多的人家，有花會筒的「航路」，有失業的，有販「白面」的，……</p>
<p>排排的房屋，建造得很擁，陽光也就寳貴了。</p>
<p>像山谷，也像井底，陽光不能够透進來：直到午間，太陽在正中的時候，原本好享受了，巷子裏的人都喜歡實惠」，一支支竹桿像網一樣交叉，飄着衣服，尿布，……</p>
<p>陽光又被擋住，祇有絲絲像霧一樣的光，從縫裏射進這黯暗的僻巷。</p>

<p>金澹雲原想的了她們這班姊妹，一同去旅行。可是仔細一想：何家姊妹是不生問題的，留她們多住幾天在上海，就多住幾天。邵慧華也好商量，剛從福建回來，未必便又派往別處去，而且她是什麼事都感着興味的。就只那個朱愛人，她是位醫師，她是服務於醫院裏當主任的，不知她可肯多耽擱幾天？還有吳氏姊妹，她們一位在當敎師，一位在做學生，她們每天都有功課，不知能吾告假一二天？這要和她們商量後，方可定奪。那天吳君素來了，商量的結果，也是說：「何氏姊妹與邵慧華，不生問題。朱愛人廳說這回到上海來，老章醫師還託她有不少事咧，並目她也難得到上海來的，大槪可以多住幾天。不過我們姊妹兩人却不能在上海多耽擱。君可是今年畢業了，她有派往美國修業的希望，近來是很爲用功，連星期日也在自修。明天吃了你的喜酒，當夜就趁了夜車回去了。我本來星期一也有課，却在下午，準備上半天回去。但是來的時候，我們在火車上說高興了，何家兩位姐姐要去參觀邵慧華服務的報館。邵慧華說：先要經館方許可以後，方能同去。大概星期日是沒有空了，預備星期一去參觀。而星期一又是約在晚間，邵慧華還請我們在報館的大餐廳吃夜飯咧。我想：新聞事業，也與我現在所敎的文學係中，息息相通。歷史便是古代的新聞，新聞就是現代的歷史，我們學校裏的學生，還要求過參觀新聞社咧。因此我趁吾妹妹君可回校的時候，託她在星期一告一天假，將我的功課和一位周教師互調一下。因爲他從前也和我互調過的，但星期二我是必定要回去的了。』金澹雲道：「好吧！那末君可妹妹，她爲了學業上的事，我不去挽留她了。你星期二必定要回去，我也不强留。但你每一星期，從星期六下午起，一直到星期一上午止，都是空閑的，你不能在這個時間裏，陪我們玩玩嗎？我准定選了這一個時間範圍裏去作旅行，並且還可以旅行車開到蘇州來接你咧。』吳君素笑道：「何必一定要凑我的日子呢？你們不是人已經很多了嗎？』（二二〇）</p>
<h3>一個棉布號學徒來函　請注意改頭換面的劣貨</h3>
<p>閱一個米業小朋友的報告後，眞使我欽佩他的精神。現在把我的情形報告出，萬望先生加以更正，披露出來，我是很感謝的。</p>
<p>我是一個才脫離學校生活而踏進棉布號中做學徒。我們的號子是做花色貨的，但是專以劣貨來改為國貨的。手續是：第一拿劣貨車來，立即開箱，這至吃過晚飯，才開始工作。起先是拿包皮紙撕去，再剪去在布端的劣貨商標及招牌，然後蓋上自己所未有（沒有）註册之商標，包上自已之招牌的包皮紙。最後裝在未用過之木箱。裝好後，即在箱上刷上招牌及國貨疋數碼數，手續完後，即去處買稅單，運往內地，及海外各地去騙取同胞及僑胞的錢。請諸位滬上及各地同胞注意及未註册之商標，一列（律）不要上當，因棉布的黑幕種類很多。例如我所看到某號的方法，是以劣貨進染缸，變爲藍布。也貼上未註冊的商標，充滿各處，所以忠告同胞，多多注意。</p>

<h3>平劇之風化問題</h3>
<p>— 渴雲樓主</p>
<p>平劇之所以卓然而許爲國劇者，乃有完滿之結構，富有歷史之情節，我國往昔之敦樸美風，偉人奇士之故事業績，搬於舞臺之上，感化於人，裨益非淺，伊人典型，我之楷模，戲劇之眞精神也。愚於公餘之暇，輒流連於劇塲，滌盪塵俗，亦求身心之小趨於邪，然偶見一二劇本，其情節之澆漓，吐詞之　薄，則深痛惡絕，竊爲不取，因其對於顧客誌一不良印象，尤為一般兒童起一不健全之思想，貽人伊戚，莫此為甚。　集歷次觀感不得，分誌如下，計（一）「人才駙馬」（二）「貴妃醉酒」（四）「紡棉花」（五）「鐵弓緣（六）「花田錯」……等，餘如「活捉張三郎」等戲，考其劇情，亦趨神怪荒謬，然寓果報之意，驚惕用心之一著，演來不傷大雅，仍有可取之處，固不在此限；鬆此國家多難，環境日非，正吾人力爭上流之秋，故雖云娛樂，當不忘救國之忱，因此對於過作渲染，戕賊身心之上列劇本，戲院當軸，宜摒棄不用，此亦聊盡國民職責之一道也。</p>
<h3>海外銀壇近聞錄</h3>
<p>— 秋雯</p>
<p>美國紐約華人協會及中國戲劇會等團體在紐約多格利街建築之中國劇場，業已全部竣工，預計明年二月間即可開幕，並聞以後將在該塲陸續公演中國舊劇及新劇，演員則大部由中國戲劇會會員擔任，在可能時，或將放映中國有意義之各種影片，以資宣揚。</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧彼兒繼「小孤雁」後之又一新作「小親家」美已全部攝竣，該片劇本係取材於英國神話故事劇本中之數節，秀蘭飾一仙女，故在該片中之作風，顯然已另創一格。</p>
<p>米高梅公司決定繼「女人」後，將攝製一部全用男女童星演出之五彩童話歷史影片，劇本係採用法國文率家亞古娜女士所著「牡丹帝后」劇本，現公司業巳全力籌備攝製中，預計在一九四〇年六月前，可全部完成。</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉碩果僅存之七齡幼女曼萊馥爾，最近在她母親主演的「風流聖后」一片中，客串飾演牧師多瑪利之養女，據說成績很不差，所以不久這位未來的童星，或許就會隸屬於米高　旗幟之下。</p>
<p>英國Askote戲院在二年前曾先後公映過兩部中國影片，一部是聯華公司的「天倫」，一部是新華公司的「貂蟬，」雖然這二部影片在該院僅僅開映了五天，但每塲無不宣告滿座，由此可見英國人士對中國影片已感到特殊的興趣，最近該院的預告，又宣露將近要開映一部中國影片，這就是最近藝華公司出品，吳邨導演張翠紅李英主演的「王寳釧﹞，因爲這個劇本過去在倫教就上演過好幾决，早已博得了英國人士的贊美，所以這次的公映，無疑地又將轟動全城的中國戲迷了。並聞該片公映時，將附帶放映中央電影製片廠最近攝製之第十六號新聞片「湘北大會戰勝利記」一片，那是給旅英僑胞一番更熱烈的興奮了。</p>
<h3>為了「祖國」</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>興奮了，剛看過「明未遺恨」，接着又看到了「祖國」。</p>
<p>這兩個劇本都告訴我們，在侵略者的壓迫下，是必然的激起爲了祖國而奮鬥的英武的抗爭！從這主題出發，沙度爲「祖國」佈置了一個可歌可泣的故事。在六慕劇中，他以動人的情節支配觀衆的情緒，以激昂的台詞窒息觀衆的呼吸，在上海淪陷了二年後的現在，「祖國」是一柄利刃，刺進了每一個人的心窩深處。</p>
<p>你看：西班牙征服了法拉芒之後，法拉芒民衆是怎樣殘酷地被判了死刑：用麻繩吊死；麻繩用完了，塡在臭水溝里；臭水溝是躺滿了屍體，則掘了大坑來掩埋。女人呢，交給兵士們自由「處置！</p>
<p>你看：李素耳和加爾洛又怎樣聯合義勇隊，和威廉親王的軍隊作裏應外合的反攻。在不幸失敗後，打鐘老人又怎樣捨身報國。</p>
<p>你看：爲了祖國，李索耳怎樣寬恕加爾洛的不義不友，將重大的責任—盡忠，交付了他。爲了祖國，加爾洛又怎樣手刃了情人多羅萊來。</p>
<p>遙望着舞台後面的火光，看着加爾洛踏着堅定的步伐離開了我的視綫，我耳畔又響着</p>
<p>一支熟稔的歌聲：</p>
<p>「生命自可貴，</p>
<p>愛情價更高，</p>
<p>若爲自由故，</p>
<p>兩者皆可拋！」</p>
<h3>談酒吧的音樂</h3>
<p>— 寒若</p>
<p>在上海，如果愛聽音樂，大致須採下列的幾個方法，　可以聽得到，（一）開收音機，收聽播送的音樂節目。（二）等候音樂演奏會，如闌心大戲院，靑年會等，不時有演奏會演出。（三）上舞塲，最後只有到酒吧間了。聽音樂的幾條途徑，除酒吧間之外，各有不完善的地方，第一，收音機不是每家都有，就是有收音機，不見得每具牧音機都很好，能很淸楚地收聽，並且收聽的節目，總覺得隔了一層空間，聽起來不大舒服。其次，音樂會倒很好，但不常常有得開。再其次舞塲的音樂，其中有好的，未嘗不可聽，不過環境又覺得嘈雜了點，因爲在靜的環境中聽音樂，總比較適宜點。那末說來說去，聽音樂還是到好一點的酒吧　去。</p>
<p>酒吧間的音樂師，大多數是上駟之材，因爲每一個酒吧間的音樂隊員只有三四人，他們的音鍵，拍子都很凖確，並且各須熟番世界名曲，方能勝任，吾則就不能在高等的酒吧間裏演奏。上海酒吧間的組成，是建築在音樂，酒，女人三者之上的，再加上美麗和富有藝術的裝璜，同着完善的人事管理，如此就成為中西人士的消遣地。愚　路上酒吧開的音樂，　　不差，諾克綏，　　非而，等處，都有幽靜的音樂可聽，尤其是諾克綏的音樂，很能使愛好的人們流連忘返。却而土，傑克，傑姆士這三個音樂師的歌唱，演奏堪稱上選之材，點奏曲子，只要你能說得出名字，他們凖會奏給你聽的。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>幾位銀行界的捧角家</p>
<p>不料東北某主席的少爺也瞧中了她，此人不但有勢，而且也很有錢，單論他的財力，也不弱於某銀行家。兩個人不光互相比賽着捧她，並且還各帶一般人時常在她寓中賭博，她每月所得的彩錢就很可觀了。不過某主席的公子也是個武人，性情很粗野，彼此雖是知道同走的一條道兒，可是某銀行家總是避着他的時候居多。某坤伶也因懼怕武人三分，當然每於接到某公子的電話時，却也常常下個軟逐客令，請某銀行家迥避。所以我說這位銀行家和那位捧叔岩的銀行家，兩人所處的境遇倒很相類似。然而話又說回來啦，銀行家究竟還是得到最後勝利，叔岩那樣的人性和誰都處不長，可是他同他那位銀行界好友，許多年來總是不會決裂過的，直到現在仍是過從甚密。據旁人傳說叔岩的存款，全是放在那家銀行中的，利息比較優厚，支存無不極爲便捷，雙方旣有了這種關係，那當然是不會分離的了。至於某坤伶的一位朋友，近兩三年來却惟我獨尊了。原來某公子早已於事變後遠離舊京，他去了一位勁敵，心中的愉快也就可想而知了。（一六七）</p>

Japanese airplanes also dropped a large number of packages on the Japanese army's positions around Kunlun Pass. It is said that the Japanese airplanes mistakenly dropped twenty packages within the Chinese army's positions. The packages contained food, intended to resupply the isolated Japanese army. The Chinese army is currently encircling the remaining Japanese army near Kunlun Pass, gradually shrinking the encirclement in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop. The Chinese army's war effort in Guangxi Province is currently employing the strategies used during the bandit suppression period, namely, advancing steadily and consolidating each position. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>

The Japanese army in Linfen is still constantly invading eastward and is being blocked by the Chinese army at Yongshan Anze, where battles occur frequently. There are many main forces of the Japanese army gathered in Changzi and Changzhi. Overall, the various attempts of the Japanese army in Shanxi have now proven to be complete failures. A certain military expert arrived here from the front lines and spoke of the current situation of the Chinese army, expressing great optimism. He said that the Chinese army's strategic experience has greatly improved, and even under the Japanese army's airplanes, artillery, and poison gas, they can still operate freely. In contrast, the Japanese army is far from what it used to be. The Ushima Division, once famous throughout the world, has been almost completely disintegrated in Shanxi Province. The Chinese army has indeed defeated the Japanese mentally. He further stated that the puppet troops are no longer being utilized. Over twenty thousand people who had defected in southern and southeastern Shanxi are now only a small number being forced to serve. Therefore, the Japanese army's strength is gradually decreasing.

<p>Beijing: According to sources on the Chinese side, guerrilla units around the Jinpu Railway have recently become increasingly active, blowing up bridges and railway tracks, causing frequent interruptions in train traffic. This information was confirmed by a foreign traveler who recently arrived here from the Jinpu Railway. The guerrilla units are part of the Eighth Route Army and only blow up freight trains, not passenger trains, but sometimes use machine guns to strafe them. It is said that a section of the railway south of Jinan has recently been heavily attacked by guerrilla units. Train traffic on the entire line was suspended for one day last week. The Japanese side is now dispatching patrol trains to travel ahead of the regularly scheduled trains on that line to clear the way. According to the traveler, the guerrilla activity is causing significant delays in train traffic. It is said that the guerrilla units do not appear to be a completely organized group. They are divided into small groups and live among the farmers, engaging in activity. If the Japanese troops move into Shandong Province in large numbers, the guerrilla units may temporarily cease their activity. At the same time, the anti-British movement in Jinan has greatly affected British businesses. It is said that British businesses are now in decline. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Actions of the American President and the Pope</h3>
<p>Before Christmas, US President Roosevelt announced the appointment of Mr. Taylor as his personal representative to the Vatican in Rome; tasked with working with the Catholic Church to strive for world peace; At the same time, in order to unite people of all faiths, to work for the restoration of peace and the relief of suffering humanity, he also sent letters to the leaders of Christianity and Judaism in the United States, inviting them to cooperate. Pope Pius XII, in addition to gladly accepting the personal representative of the American President, delivered a speech on the eve of Christmas calling for peace: Denouncing acts of aggression and violence, saying that they will inevitably be punished by God in the future; he also presented five basic principles for building a just peace: (1) All countries, regardless of size or strength, should have the right to exist and be independent. No country should sentence another to death for its own will to exist; (2) Countries should cooperate to gradually reduce armaments; (3) Reform international organizations and guarantee various treaties, (4) Consider in good faith the legitimate demands and needs of all countries, nations, and minorities, and satisfy them in a peaceful manner, and revise existing treaties when necessary; (5) All nations and their leaders must consider the simple and unshakable principles that conform to natural law, and consider the dignity of mankind. Three weeks ago, in the beginning of this month, in view of the three sets of wars internationally, we said that mankind urgently needs to be of one heart and one mind, pooling their wisdom and efforts, so that mistakes can be corrected in time and the evolution of sin can be stopped; We asserted that if the natural development of the current phenomenon is allowed to run its course in any aspect, it will eventually cause trouble; Therefore, we hope that the Italian monarch and ministers, the American President, the kings of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the Pope, who have worked hard for peace, will gather the greatest strength from all parties to promote a total solution to the various sets of wars; If a total solution cannot be achieved, any belligerents who take the initiative should be encouraged to be the first to accept reasonable settlement proposals. Now, the American President and the Pope have launched another initiative; We secretly hope that this is not a gospel to decorate the Christmas season, but that it will be a real benefit to humanity.</p>
<p>If war cannot be limited, it will inevitably lengthen and expand; If aggression cannot be punished, it will inevitably become more and more intense with impunity; If the calls for justice and peace cannot achieve effective consequences, then justice and peace will inevitably become more and more distant from the realization of their truth with each ineffective call, which also proves the recklessness of violence and only contributes to its ferocity. All these evil deeds, if they do not advance, they will retreat, and if they do not retreat, they will advance. This alternation has formed a certain pattern, a law that has lasted for thousands of years. Since the Shenyang Incident of September 18, 1931, to the battle between British and German warships on the neutral waters of America in the middle of this month; From the dawn movement of opposing imperialism and supporting weak nations, to the opportunism of colluding with the strong and seizing by trickery; From the League of Nations, within the League of Nations organization, attempting to save oneself by sophistry, to gain acceptance by power tactics, to openly tearing up various treaties and wantonly smearing the international map; The signs of this evolution have become more and more inferior, and more and more evil; The facts are like iron, and no one can deny them. Is it true that those who come gradually have been planned actions from the past to the present? Because the initial failure to prevent problems before they occur, followed by the failure to prevent them from developing, led to infection and spread, and everyone followed suit in doing evil, resulting in the extreme deterioration that we see today! However, today is still not the end of extreme deterioration. If all parties were to stand by and watch, allowing the natural development of the current phenomenon to continue; If the recent remarks of US President Roosevelt and Pope Pius XII were only to decorate the Christmas season; Then not only will the world's miserable scene next Christmas be far more cruel than this year, but tomorrow will also be far more fierce than today.</p>
<p>After these appeals from the American President and the Pope, we have something to appeal to the American President and the Pope: You are the outstanding authorities in the world, both materially and spiritually, and you have a sincere belief in justice and peace. Do not regard what you believe in as mere philosophy, but uphold this sincerity, with a sense of responsibility and proactive action, to promote and realize what you believe in tangibly? We certainly know that those who are insane have lost their reason and lost their normal state. It cannot be expected that peace and justice will be achieved merely by a call to action by those in authority, and that all the wise and foolish will respond in the same reasonable way. We certainly know that those with outstanding authority are not able to control and dominate everything. However, the resolution of international disputes, with regard to the specifics and techniques, awaits fair measurement and calm formulation; this is still a blank sheet of paper, with no way to ask the two sides about their claims, or to inquire about the ability of the two sides to integrate. With regard to basic principles, then the two sides in the dispute can be asked. Those who are happy to accept the principles will then cooperate to overcome difficulties and resolve the specifics and techniques, encouraging both sides with good intentions and expecting fairness from both sides. Those who are unwilling to accept the basic principles are cut off from civilized humanity and can be seen to be evil without repentance; Given the danger of intensification, they are public enemies of justice and peace; If the American President and the Pope cannot immediately launch a punitive expedition, they should exert their outstanding authority to absolutely isolate them materially and spiritually, and not allow them to harm civilized humanity; This, for those who have a sincere belief in justice and peace, under a sense of responsibility, is an action that cannot be shirked? If this is not done, what is the point of belief? What is the point of sincerity? Part of humanity is already in deep water and fire, and others are also in imminent danger; We sincerely hope that no nation or its leaders will refuse to accept the basic principles of fairness, but to ask each country in the war whether they are willing to accept the principles is something that the American President and the Pope should act on now!</p>
<h3>Japan's Lack of Sincerity in Negotiations with the United States Makes Renewal of Commercial Treaty Difficult - Inward Talk Reveals Weaknesses in Japanese Diplomacy - Says Further Communication is Needed with Military Leaders Invading China</h3>
<p>Washington: The US government's silence on trade talks in Tokyo has given the impression that US-Japan talks are not as optimistic as Japan has reported. The Tokyo side said trade can continue as normal after the US-Japan trade agreement expires. US officials have said there is no evidence to support this claim. According to observers, the US is dissatisfied with the terms Japan has offered. US businessmen believe US Ambassador Grew and Nomura are engaging in trade talks. As for the current results, it is not enough to say that relations have been adjusted. Although Japan has agreed to open the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, and to compensate Americans for their losses, it is not enough for Japan to maintain normal trade relations after the expiry of the US-Japan trade agreement. (United Press dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horiuchi said yesterday that if the Japanese government is to make concessions in order to renew its commercial treaty with the United States, it must first consult with Japanese military authorities in China. Tokyo has sent a committee of military and business leaders to China to discuss the matter with Japanese military leaders in China. Ambassador Horiuchi also said that Japan's desire to conclude a new commercial treaty is a "true hope." Foreign Minister Nomura has already said that Japan wants a real deal and not verbal assurances. Ambassador Horiuchi then mentioned the US-Japan talks in Tokyo, saying that they had made great progress and that a satisfactory result was expected. (United Press dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3>American Legislators Call for Justice - Japan's Dream Has Not Yet Awakened - No Compromise Should Be Made</h3>
<p>Washington: Senator King, a Democrat from Utah, said yesterday that the United States must make Japan abandon its dream of dominating East Asia, if we conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan, Japan must first abandon this dream, now is a good opportunity to promote peace in East Asia, but as long as Japan continues its aggression against China, I will never want the US government to shake hands with it, Four hundred million Chinese people have been forced to leave their families, and 100 million have been killed or injured. This is truly one of the most tragic chapters in human history. (United Press dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3>American Cotton Merchants Are Driven by Profit and Advocate Continuing Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>Washington: McKesson, president of the influential American Cotton Manufacturers Association, told a United Press reporter yesterday that if the 1911 US-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty expires and the United States does not sign a new treaty with Japan, it will have a serious impact on US-Japan commerce. McKesson said the Cotton Manufacturers Association is eager to renegotiate a commercial deal with Japan. "If a new treaty is not signed, it will have a serious impact on US-Japan commerce. I don't believe US-Japan commerce will be destroyed as a result, but it will be a serious obstacle to US-Japan commerce." Since the German and Italian markets have been lost, Japan is still an important market for American cotton. Others say that the cotton merchants' groups have different positions on the Japanese commercial situation. They say that the Japanese business community deeply relies on American cotton merchants to maintain the status quo of US-Japan commercial relations, because Japan is the largest customer for American cotton. However, several important business groups and political experts say that the cotton merchants have not given Japan the assistance it deserves. One source pointed out that, according to US Chamber of Commerce statistics, US cotton exports account for only 5.7% of total US exports, while Japanese purchases of US cotton account for only 1.7% of total US exports.

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Relations: Significant Developments Expected; Resolution of Tianjin Silver Issue: Understanding Reportedly Reached</h3>
<p>London – According to information received yesterday by foreign embassies here regarding the Far East, Anglo-Japanese relations are on the verge of significant developments. It is generally believed that the British government will announce a resolution to the Tianjin Anglo-Japanese dispute after the New Year. It is widely believed that the two sides have reached an understanding on the silver issue, thus resolving the Tianjin case easily. Although the British side did not sacrifice major interests during the Tianjin negotiations, it is generally recalled that in July of this year, the British and Japanese sides had discussed ways to maintain security in the British concession in Tianjin. However, in August, the Japanese side demanded that the silver stored in Tianjin by the Chinese side be handed over to the Japanese side, leading to the breakdown of Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The agreed-upon method of maintaining security was shelved. It is reported that the future resolution of the Tianjin case will include a joint US-Japanese approach to maintaining security in the British concession. Japanese sources here hope that after a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin case, the British side will be able to engage with the planned "New Central Government" based on the principle of gradually restoring order. According to reporters' investigations, Chinese sources here are paying more attention to the United States' attitude towards Japan than to British concessions to Japan.

<h3>Southern Ireland's Prime Minister Broadcasts to America, Responding to Roosevelt's Call; Advocates Convening an International Conference as Soon as Possible; British King Broadcasts Explanation of the Meaning of Christmas</h3>
<p>Dublin – Éamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Republic of Southern Ireland, recently broadcast a speech to the United States, advocating for "a meeting of the authorities of the governments of all belligerent nations to seek a peaceful solution," and stating that "the peoples of all nations suffering from the scourge of war are threatened with sympathy by the people of the United States and the Irish Republic. It must be known that as a result of modern warfare, all belligerent nations, whether victors or vanquished, must tighten their belts and suffer all kinds of hardships within a few years after the war. This alone means that all belligerent nations have a need to seek a solution as soon as possible. I believe that since the conference method must be tried again after the war, why not do it as soon as possible before the war has exhausted its destructive power?" (Havas report, 26th)</p>
<p>London – King George VI, who had continued his father's habit of broadcasting to the peoples of the British Empire every Christmas for two years, had once discontinued this practice. Yesterday, due to the war, after having lunch with the Queen and his two daughters at Sandringham Palace, he entered his study alone before 3:00 PM and gave a speech to the entire British Empire using the same radio that he had used two years ago. He said, "The Christmas we know is a festival of peace and a festival of family. All free people deeply love peace, for only peace can provide security for the family. Our true peace is in our hearts. At this time, there is a strong nation whose purpose and policies are based on aggression and oppression of what we regard as humanity's most precious possessions. This is the tragedy of today. My people have therefore risen up and shown a unity never before heard of in previous wars. Our hearts feel that we are fighting to unite people and resist evil. With this belief," people's strength is increasing day by day until victory is achieved. We are now preparing for everything in the future with steadfast spirit and belief in our families.</p>
<p>"We are filled with joy and gratitude at the loyalty and bravery of the British Navy. In the past few months, our navy has been at the forefront of the war. When I speak of our navy today, I am referring to all those who go to sea in the entire Empire, whether they be warships or merchant ships, from high-ranking officers to servants. In my own name and on behalf of the people, I express my gratitude and congratulations to those who have joined this great fleet. I extend the same gratitude and congratulations to the brave air force. Our air force, together with the navy, is our armor, and they are now increasing the glory of their ancestors day by day. I would also like to extend my congratulations to the Imperial Army, the soldiers from overseas, and the expeditionary force in France. Their work is difficult, and they are currently waiting. Waiting is a test of courage and discipline, but I know that once they engage in battle, they will fulfill their great duties and be worthy of the highest honor inherent in Britain. To all those who are preparing to serve the country at sea, on land, and in the air, I extend my congratulations at this time. Our vast empire, although men and women have different duties, has the same purpose: to be members of one big family and to prepare to sacrifice everything to preserve the freedom of the world. This is the spirit of our empire's self-governing dominions, India, and various territories. Aid is coming from all sides, for which the mother country is very grateful. The unity of purpose and effort is unprecedented in the world.</p>
<p>"I deeply believe that what unites my people with our loyal and brave allies is Christian civilization. Only on the basis of Christianity can true civilization be created. As we pass through the current dark age and create the peace that all humanity seeks, let us not forget this. The New Year is approaching. What will come with the New Year? We cannot say. If peace comes with the New Year, we will be endlessly grateful. If continued struggle comes with it, we will not be afraid. The writings of the 17th-century English writer Penn have something to inspire us. Before I end my words, I would like to recite Penn's words to the people of the country: 'I stand before the door of the New Year and tell it, "Give me light, so that I may walk safely into the unknown path." The person answers, "Enter into the darkness and place your hand in the grasp of the true Master. Thus, it is better for you than light, safer than the known path." ' I humbly pray that God guide us and protect us." (Reuters report, 26th)</p>

The meeting agreed to praise the government's clear expression of the importance of the Netherlands' strict adherence to its neutrality policy and Belgium. The Socialist Party's annual meeting also passed resolutions on Belgium's economic, financial, agricultural, and social policies. During the discussion of the above-mentioned motions, all parties agreed that in the current difficult times, the interests of the whole society should be the premise and the interests of individuals should be sacrificed. Therefore, it was regretted that the privileged classes refused to accept this spirit of sacrifice. The meeting then called on the government to strictly control munitions and arsenals. Although it criticized the incomplete construction of Belgium's air defense, it also solemnly stated that the state's financial burden made it impossible to complete air defense construction. The socialist members of the current cabinet demanded that the government take a firm stance and support the expansion of social legislation. After the agenda of the Socialist Party's annual meeting was completed, a simple memorial ceremony was held to commemorate Vandervelde, who was one of the founders of the Belgian Socialist Party and served as its chairman for thousands of years.

<h3>Hundreds of Soviet Planes Bomb Southern Finland; Finnish Capital Also Bombed Twice; Ten Soviet Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>Helsinki – Hundreds of Soviet planes flew to Finland yesterday to drop bombs everywhere to celebrate Christmas. Residents of the Finnish capital were forced to spend their holiday in bomb shelters. In addition to the Finnish capital, key railway points and several major cities were bombed. It is reported that no fewer than 13 Soviet planes were shot down yesterday. One crashed outside the city of Finland. The Finnish capital was attacked twice by 30 enemy planes, which attempted to destroy the Finnish capital's airfield, but failed. One key point that received the most attention from enemy planes was the Ruohimäki railway junction. In the town of Porvoo on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, nine civilians were killed by bombing. (Reuters report, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Yesterday was Christmas Day. Soviet aircraft formations came twice in the morning and afternoon to bomb, mostly dropping bombs in the northern suburbs. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Until 1:45 PM today, the city issued another air raid warning. Residents went into air raid shelters, and their attitude was calm. As of the time of the dispatch, no enemy aircraft had been found, but the weather today is severely cold, and visibility is poor. Even if enemy aircraft come, I am afraid they will not be able to use their skills. In addition, many cities inland were bombed yesterday, and a large number of civilians were killed. For example, the town of Porvoo, which is only 50 miles away from here, has no garrison and no industry. It has no military value. The normal population of residents is only 7,000. Since the war, many women and children in the capital have fled to this place. It was also bombed yesterday, killing 9 and injuring 38. In other cities like Åbo, one person was killed and 13 were injured. There was no major damage to the port of Viipuri. It has been confirmed that ten enemy aircraft were shot down. (Havas report, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – As a Christmas gift, the Soviets launched a fierce attack on the center of the Mannerheim Line at 3:00 AM yesterday. The Soviets fired 200 bullets per minute at Finnish positions. About 900 shock troops. The Finns fought hard, and the Soviets failed to succeed. The reporter spent Christmas Eve on the front line. The weather was severely cold, at minus 10 degrees. For those of you who spend the holiday in a warm, bright, and comfortable home, the reporter really does not know what words to use to write about the situation on the front line. The sky was bright with a high moon, and the ground was covered with four inches of snow. Finnish officers and soldiers were not celebrating because they were planning how to resist the Soviet offensive, as the Soviets would take advantage of this holiday to attack. (United Press report, 25th)</p>
<h3>Glimpse of the Battle Situation on the Finnish Front</h3>
<p>Helsinki – Tall fir trees reach the sky, the sky shows a sad color, and the mountain slopes are covered with snow, stretching endlessly. This was Christmas Day on the northern front line of the Soviet-Finnish war yesterday. The reporter looked out over "no man's land" from a Finnish artillery fort on a high ground, and felt that the scenery was not fierce. A Finnish officer pointed to a mountain slope opposite and said to me, "There are Russian troops there. You cannot see them, but they cannot see you either. Later, you will notice their tracks." As soon as the officer finished speaking, there was an explosion in the distance. Therefore, the officer explained that this was the Russian army shelling a certain location in the forest, as the end of ten days of fierce fighting, because the Russian army is now retreating. The occasional artillery fire is nothing more than wanting us to know that they have not retreated yet. Even their retreat is not easy. The reporter asked if the Russian army would come back. The officer replied that they would not come back anytime soon. There are about one division of Soviet troops on the front line of Lake Sala, or 15,000 people. According to Finnish estimates, at least half of this division has been killed or wounded. Near the place I visited, there was a fierce battle three days ago. In this battle, 600-700 Soviet troops were killed. While we were talking, a Finnish ski commando wearing white clothes passed by us, and then we heard the sound of machine guns firing in the distance. The officer laughed and said, "What are their targets? They are only shooting elk in the forest!" However, when the reporter drove a white-painted vehicle to the front line, he saw that those killed by the Soviets were not only elk, but also Finnish soldiers. When I drove back from the front, I saw many camps, each of which could accommodate 26 people. They were all well hidden, so that from a few feet away, you would not know that they were camps for soldiers to live in. All that could be seen were branches of trees. In addition, the Finnish soldiers' ability to withstand the cold is very amazing. (United Press report, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Finnish officials today recounted the battle situation in the first three weeks of the war, saying that the Soviets had suffered extremely heavy losses in this war, often with entire armies annihilated. Although the enemy generals drove their troops to approach, they were blocked by the firepower of the defenders, and corpses were all over the field. More than 200 enemy tanks were destroyed or captured, and dozens of enemy planes were shot down. Dozens of artillery pieces and hundreds of machine guns were also captured. Although the Finnish army also suffered casualties, they were fewer than the Soviets. The Soviets suffered heavy losses on the Mannerheim Line and the Karelian Isthmus, paying a great price for every inch of ground they gained. The Finnish air force demonstrated its brave skills in the air battles over the Karelian Isthmus, inflicting heavy damage on the Soviet air force. The Soviets repeatedly tried to break through the Finnish lines, but failed in every place. North of Lake Ladoga, the enemy's pressure was very strong. After the Finnish army withdrew from its outposts, it was deployed along the Lomo-La area. Although the Soviets launched a fierce attack, they were ultimately ineffective. At present, the Finnish army and air force are showing their unwavering fighting spirit and are giving the enemy and the world evidence of the Finnish defenders' loyalty, bravery, and patriotism.

Furthermore, in the Suomussalmi region, the Red Army is putting up strong resistance. (3) The Soviet cruiser "Marat" fired on our port of Koivisto, but because it was far from the shore, there was no damage. (4) Soviet aircraft flew over our positions for reconnaissance and bombed our fortress artillery positions, but all attempts failed. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Captured German Ship Flies British Flag - Sails Through Panama Canal - U.S. Authorities Take Special Precautions - Eighteen Ships of Various Countries Sunk in the Past Week</h3>
<p>Balboa, Panama - A large crowd stood on the banks of the Panama Canal yesterday to watch the captured 4,930-ton German ship "Düsseldorf" pass through, marking the first captured prize by the British Navy to pass through the Panama Canal. The ship had previously been captured by the British destroyer "Despatch" off the coast of Chile. As it passed through the canal, the British naval flag flew above the swastika flag at the stern. British sailors with rifles and bayonets patrolled the deck. Many spectators cheered. Due to rumors that Germans on board might attempt to run the ship aground in the narrow parts of the canal, U.S. authorities took special precautions, guiding it with a tugboat. It was towed forward as it passed the Culebra Cut turn, for fear that the ship would run aground. Usually, ships passing through this turn do not require towing by other ships. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London - It has been officially announced that, during the week from the 17th to the 23rd of this month, a total of eighteen British and neutral ships were sunk by Germany, with a total tonnage of 18,000 tons.

<h3>Protests Against Violations of the American Neutral Zone May Not Be Effective - Britain and France Consistently Demand the Preservation of All Rights</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the violation of the American "neutral zone," the twenty-one American republics submitted notes to the governments of Britain, France, and Germany yesterday to protest. These notes have not yet arrived here, but well-informed political sources have just clarified the views held by Britain and France regarding the "neutral zone," stating that if the purpose of the American countries' actions is to prompt the belligerent countries to issue formal declarations explaining their attitudes, then Britain and France will exchange views in a short period of time to determine a policy, so that they can submit a reply in an appropriate manner. As it stands now, Britain and France consistently reserve all rights regarding this "neutral zone," because those countries believe that, in order to be fair to the decision of the Pan-American Conference regarding the delineation of the neutral zone, it must be applied equally to all belligerent countries. Therefore, the twenty-one American republics must take strict supervisory measures to ensure the neutrality of the 300-mile sea area along the American continent and prevent German warships from engaging in any illegal activities within this range, since Germany has always disregarded the law and "strict supervision is necessary to ensure that it respects international order." Based on this, the future of the American "neutral zone" depends on whether the sea supervision measures can be fully effective. Given that the American countries do not hold prejudices against Britain and France, a satisfactory solution can still be found. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>New York - Regarding the violation of the American neutral zone, after the American governments lodged protests to the belligerent countries yesterday, the morning newspapers here commented on it, with some saying that its wording was too vague and others saying that it was unlikely to be effective. The New York Public Opinion Forum reported that it was unlikely that the belligerent countries would accept the note. The belligerent countries, compelled by the necessity of warfare, had to take certain actions. As the American countries had failed to take this into account, and their attitude was somewhat lacking in basis under international law, it was unlikely that it would be effective. It also argued that those who advocated setting up the neutral zone were too shortsighted about the current war, as the American countries would be in a position to fall into a state of war. The New York Times reported that the neutral zone delineated by the Pan-American Conference encompassed the sea area within 300 miles of the American continent. Its area was so vast that it would be very difficult for the American countries to carry out police duties within it in practice. "In short, whether this neutral zone can be put into practice depends on two factors: first, whether the American countries can make the belligerent countries understand that combat in the neutral zone on the sea off the coast of Asia will arouse public opinion in the American countries, and at the same time convince them that the American countries will formulate regulations so that neither side of the belligerent countries will be uniquely disadvantaged."

<h3>European Air Combat Film to be Shipped to Shanghai for Screening</h3>
<p>Paris - A new British air combat film, called "The Lion Has Wings," in which the air forces of Britain and France participated, premiered grandly tonight at a major cinema on the Champs-Élysées here. Celebrities from all walks of life came to see it, and all praised it. The two most exciting sections of the film are: one, a British bomber fleet attacking the German naval port of Kiel at the beginning of the war; two, nine French aircraft engaging in a fierce battle with twenty-seven German aircraft, resulting in the shooting down of nine German aircraft, while all the French aircraft safely returned to base. In addition, there are several scenes showing the close cooperation between the British and French air forces. The magnificent spectacle can be called a masterpiece. According to film industry sources, this film will soon be shipped to Shanghai for screening. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Mobile Front Line of the Nationalist Army in Western Zhejiang - The Nationalist Army Achieves Great Battlefield Successes - The Japanese Army Has Become a Spent Arrow</h3>
<p>Jinhua Correspondence - The alluvial plains of western Zhejiang, long known as the land of fish and rice, a wealthy area, now have twelve and a half counties and one city occupied. Counting from the day Hangzhou City was abandoned (Hangzhou City fell on December 24, 1937, the last temporarily abandoned piece of national territory in western Zhejiang), it has been two years today.</p>
<p>For the past two years, considering the front-line positions of the two armies facing each other, from Wuhu Digang on the left to Fuyang Yuhang on the right, with Xuan City as the endpoint in the middle, this front line has not only not changed, but in some places, the Japanese army has shortened its defensive line. Taking only western Zhejiang, the Japanese troops in Fuyang and Yuhang have been forced to retreat from some of their outer strongholds. This proves that since China's resistance against Japan for two years, it has been impossible for the Japanese army to expand its battlefield achievements, and it is difficult to maintain its occupation of the "surface" area. The end of the strong crossbow cannot pierce the Lu silk.</p>
<p>The Era of Guerrilla Warfare Begins</p>
<p>After the fall of Hangzhou, the Japanese army stopped on the north bank of the Qiantang River, facing the Nationalist army across the water, with Yuhang and Fuyang as its left and right flanks, to consolidate Hangzhou. During this period, both armies focused on internal reorganization, and both sides lived in peace. Within three months, there were no major battles on the front line, only sporadic artillery battles to punctuate the silent atmosphere. In March 1938, the headquarters of the 7th Army Group of the Nationalist Army and the military authorities of Zhejiang Province agreed on a plan to launch guerrilla warfare in western Zhejiang, and successively sent teams to cross the river to the north, leading local armed forces, distributed in areas such as Haiyan, Haining, Pinghu, and Jiaxing. The virgin guerrilla warfare of western Zhejiang began there. Every point on every highway was often sabotaged by the Nationalist army, and all waterways were blocked. Teams were also sent to cross the railway line, controlling both sides of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and constantly attacking it. The capture of Haiyan County on May 15 can be said to have opened a new page in the history of guerrilla warfare in western Zhejiang. Later, Haiyan was lost and regained many times, and this "guerrilla city" became a county that the people of Zhejiang paid special attention to.</p>
<p>In total, there were more than 200 fierce guerrilla battles in the past year. A total of 9,000 Japanese troops were annihilated in various places. The roadbeds and surfaces of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, the Jiaxing-Huzhou Highway, and the Pinghu-Zha Pu Highway were damaged more than 200 times. More than 50 bridges were blown up, and 80 or 90 motorboats and ships were sunk or captured. More than 50 cars were destroyed or captured. Dozens of steel cannons and more than 30 heavy machine guns were intercepted. Except for the west side of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, western Zhejiang is mostly a plain area, with crisscrossing harbors and rivers, which is not very suitable for guerrilla warfare, so the above achievements can be considered very satisfactory. This was exchanged for the blood and flesh of heroic soldiers, and this achievement finally laid the foundation for the guerrilla area in western Zhejiang.</p>
<p>A New Posture for the Guerrilla Area</p>
<p>The guerrilla warfare in western Zhejiang in the past year has moved from the founding period to the second stage, and its strength has gradually increased, but there are still many shortcomings that need to be strengthened. Therefore, the military authorities decided to reorganize and adjust the combat troops back to the south bank in batches for reorganization and replenishment. On the other hand, after the establishment of the Western Zhejiang Administrative Office, it also made a decision on some "old-fashioned" local guerrilla teams, incorporating and training them to become elite troops. The face of western Zhejiang has been completely renewed.</p>
<p>Starting in the spring of this year, new military operations by the Nationalist side began again. Most of the new forces advanced to the rear of the Japanese army. The line from the south bank of the Qiantang River to the south bank of the Fuchun River, and the line on the west side of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, were more powerful than before. In April, the Japanese army's sharp edge was repeatedly frustrated between Wukang and Wuxing in the southern section of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. In June, the battle of Hushu shocked the Japanese puppet regime. In September, two Japanese military trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road were blown up one after another, and the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. In the same month, in the battle on the border of Jiangsu, Xie Zhijun, the deputy commander of the puppet pacification forces, was captured alive. In October, they rushed into Hangzhou City and achieved brilliant battle results. In November, the counter-encirclement battles of Wuxing, Chongde, and Tongxiang were successful. These were all larger battles in the past eleven months. The remaining small-scale guerrilla battles occur every day.</p>
<p>In the past eleven months of guerrilla warfare this year, the battle in which we rushed into Hangzhou City last month and the anti-encirclement battle in western Zhejiang in November have been somewhat successful in terms of strategy and tactics. For example, in the battle of rushing into Hangzhou City, the various troops were able to echo each other and cooperate closely. For example, in the counter-encirclement battle in western Zhejiang, the Nationalist army avoided internal operations and conducted a Go-style guerrilla war, breaking out of the encirclement and adopting a counter-encirclement formation, and also received the response of the Nationalist army on the southeast side of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the west side of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. The Zhejiang Eastern troops also crossed the river to the north to attack Hangzhou, causing the Japanese army to be besieged everywhere, with enemies on all sides, resulting in collapse.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Actively Returns With Its Wings Clipped</p>
<p>From March last year to November this year, the so-called "sweeping" battles adopted by the Japanese army in western Zhejiang are unknown. Among them, the larger ones include the battles of Anji, Xiaofeng, and Changxing in March last year, in which the Japanese side mobilized 10,000 people. The result was that more than 2,000 Japanese troops were captured by the Nationalist army. In early August, in the battle of Jiaxing and Haiyan, the Japanese army mobilized 5,000 or 6,000 troops and encountered a serious blow from the Nationalist army. As a result, only an empty city of Haiyan was obtained, but it was soon captured by the Nationalist army taking advantage of the vacancy. In October, the Japanese army in western Zhejiang "swept" the area and mobilized 4,000 or 5,000 troops, but the Nationalist army launched a counter-sweeping operation in 23 routes, giving the Japanese army a strong response. In March of this year, the Japanese army again "swept" the area with a mobilized force of 5,000 troops. After being severely beaten by the Nationalist army, they were forced to retreat. In November, in the battle of Wuxing, Chongde, and Tongxiang, the Japanese army mobilized 4,000 or 5,000 troops, attempting to "annihilate" a certain unit of the Nationalist army in one fell swoop, but it was counter-encircled by the Nationalist army, fought fiercely for seven days, and returned with its wings clipped.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attempts to Invade Nantian - Repelled by Nationalist Garrison</h3>
<p>Nantian Correspondence - Nantian is an isolated island, located at the mouth of Sanmen Bay, and is the smallest county in Zhejiang Province. Since the war of resistance, although Japanese planes and warships have passed through from time to time, it has not been disturbed until now. At about 8:00 AM on the 20th of this month, two Japanese warships were discovered on the sea near Gaotang Longquan Bay in the county. At about 10:00 AM, three motorboats were lowered, carrying 30 to 40 soldiers, and under the cover of artillery fire from the warships, they forcibly landed at Jinjia Chair of Zhumen Port. The Nationalist defending forces rose up to fight fiercely. The two sides fought fiercely until about 12:00 noon, when the Japanese army was repelled and fled back to the warships. The Japanese warships also retreated immediately. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than a dozen casualties, while the Nationalist side suffered very little losses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Retreat Almost Completely from Four Suburbs of Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence - In recent days, the Japanese troops stationed in Suzhou have become increasingly scarce. Even during the daytime, Japanese troops are rarely seen on the main streets. As for the Japanese troops originally stationed in Chenmu, Jiaozhi, Xietang, etc., they have now withdrawn almost completely. Currently, a very small number of troops are stationed at the old site of the Huayuan Hotel outside Lumen. In addition to a hundred or so people stationed near the train station, the Japanese troops in the old barracks of the Fifth Regiment departed for other places in the first ten days of this month. At the same time, due to the emptiness of the defenses, the Japanese army ordered the Second Brigade of the puppet provincial police to be reorganized into the puppet army, under the command of the puppet pacification commander Gong Guoliang. Due to the lack of firearms, the Japanese side has now allocated 300 old-style rifles and designated them to be stationed at Xikuatang and Muduzhen outside Xumen.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Spies on Qidong - Attempt to Land Fails</h3>
<p>Qidong Correspondence - In the county's coastal Lingdian Port and Sanhe Port, the Japanese army occasionally comes to these places, attempting to land, but they have been prevented by the Provincial Security × Brigade defending forces in those places. On the 3rd of this month, two Japanese warships suddenly came outside Lingdian Port and immediately landed by motorboat, but they were still swept by machine guns by the × Brigade, preventing them from approaching the shore. The Japanese army fired dozens of artillery shells, and two Nationalist soldiers were killed and one was injured, but the remaining soldiers, seeing that the Japanese artillery fire was fierce, still vowed not to retreat, so the Japanese army was unable to land and retreated immediately. On the 4th, three Japanese warships came to Sanhe Port again, preventing merchant ships from approaching the shore and forcibly dragging away several civilian boats, landing immediately. They were swept by machine guns by the soldiers of the Provincial Security × Regiment. The Japanese army, seeing that the situation was fierce and the boatmen were injured by bullets, retreated back to the warships.</p>

<h3>Pudong Guard Trench Battles: Japanese Actually Use Poison Gas, Chinese Guerrillas Fight Bravely, Almost Entire Japanese Puppet Army Stationed There Annihilated</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this month, guerrilla forces have launched a large-scale offensive along the coastal areas of Pudong, with the fiercest fighting occurring in the Hutung area. Japanese puppet troops have suffered extremely heavy casualties, and the fighting has only recently stopped. The Japanese, realizing their strength was insufficient, temporarily suspended operations on the Shangchuan Road, transferring nearly a thousand Japanese soldiers from the city center, equipped with sophisticated weaponry, to rush to the rescue. However, the guerrilla forces led by Gu Lifeng and others fought bravely and refused to yield. In desperation, the Japanese army resorted to using poison gas, causing significant casualties to the guerrilla forces. However, during the fighting, almost all of the original stationed Japanese puppet troops were annihilated. Currently, the Hutung and Sanzhao areas are still occupied by Japanese puppet forces.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Expand Jurisdiction of Pudong Police</p>
<p>The puppet "garrison" is actively attempting to control "police powers" on the water. In addition to establishing a "Water Patrol Headquarters" on Dongchang Road in Pudong, which dispatches several unarmed "police" in sampans to patrol the Huangpu River daily, competing for authority with the existing Customs Water Patrol, it has recently expanded its influence beyond the original urban areas. "Detachments" have been established in Chongming and Minhang, one in Wusong, one in Beixinjing, one in Yangjing in Pudong, and one at Guanqiao in Nanshi, all of which were announced on the previous day. Each "detachment" has two shifts of unarmed "water police" stationed within.</p>
<p>Japanese Wounded Soldiers Cannot Be Accommodated</p>
<p>Recently, tens of thousands of wounded Japanese soldiers have been transported back from the front lines to the rear in central China. As a result, Japanese wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai are unable to accommodate them. Therefore, in Nanshi, in addition to the Lushan Hospital on Longhua Road being occupied as a wounded soldier hospital and already filled, a portion of the Wan Zhu School building in the city has also been converted into a convalescent hospital for wounded soldiers. This is still insufficient, so over thirty civilian houses in Longmen Village on Shangwen Road, totaling over one hundred rooms, have been requisitioned, all connected, and converted into a wounded soldier hospital. Construction has now been completed, but the wounded soldiers have not yet been moved in. Furthermore, the Japanese have also built a large-scale crematorium in Paotaiwan, Wusong. According to visitors, dozens or over a hundred bodies are burned to ashes daily, placed in jars, and transported back to Japan. Recently, the Japanese have also newly opened a crematorium in the Tiantong’an area.</p>
<h3>International Relief Committee Emphasizes Production Work, Admonishes Refugees in Various Centers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee previously noted that refugees in the shelters had nothing to do, making them prone to developing habits of laziness. It therefore specifically formulated measures for mandatory production, which has proven effective since its implementation. Recently, due to the passage of time, instances of negligence have been discovered. Deeply concerned about failing the enthusiastic relief efforts of society, the committee issued a notice, sternly reprimanding and rectifying the situation. The committee also hopes that various factories and businesses will be concerned about the purpose of refugee production and recruit them at any time, so as to achieve the benefit of mutual relief. The notice is transcribed below. Its purpose is to reduce the burden on society, in line with the original intention of relief, and to enable refugees with the ability to work to gain a basis for self-reliance, so that when the shelters are dissolved in the future, they can use their skills to avoid starvation. This good intention should be deeply understood by all refugees. However, according to recent findings, a woman who was referred to a carpet factory for work at the time of admission actually refused to be bound by the factory, arbitrarily refusing to work without reason. These people believe that the shelters provide food and clothing, leaving them with no worries and complete freedom of action. After a careful investigation by the committee, this was found to be true. According to the previously established regulations on mandatory production work for refugees, she should have been immediately expelled from the shelter. However, considering her youth and lack of awareness of the seriousness of the matter, the shelter director has instructed her family members to record a major demerit each. From now on, if any of the above occurs with refugees who have the ability to work, not only will the offending person be immediately expelled, but their family members will also be ordered to leave the shelter as a warning to parents who indulge their children and those who are lazy and content with abandoning themselves. In addition to instructing the shelters to comply, this notice is hereby circulated for general information.</p>
<h3>Report of German Planes Bombing London Not Confirmed, Transmitted by San Francisco Radio Station</h3>

<h3>Soybean and Rice Merchants Suggest Citywide Grain Registration, All Rice Arrived Domestically and Rice Arrived from Overseas Must Be Registered Within Five Days or Considered Hoarding, Municipal Council Believes Grain Storage Should Be Managed by Rice Merchants</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean Industry Association and Rice Merchants Association, recognizing that high rice prices affect security in the concession, held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the third floor of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Exchange at 15 Edward Road. The meeting was attended by representatives Chen Ziyi, Xing Zhigang, Zhu Yunchang, Shi Hongxun, Huang Zhihe, Jiang Hongbin, Fu Qiangeng, Zhu Xiangsheng, Yan Xiaoquan, Xing Zhigang, Zhu Zifan, Cao Xinggeng, She Bingwen, Gu Yisheng, Zhang Lizhong, Jin Zhaoyun, Pan Jibin, Lu Wenshao, Wang Tianchou, and others, a total of eighteen people. Xing Zhigang was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting and the current rice market situation, followed by each attending member rising to contribute their opinions. Discussions then began on: (1) The suggestion to the Food Regulation Association to handle rice registration. It was resolved that the Food Regulation Association should publish an announcement in the newspaper that all rice arrived domestically and rice arrived from overseas, whether arrived or not, should be registered with the association within five days, or it would be considered hoarding. (2) A letter should be sent to the Food Regulation Association urging it to quickly organize discounted rice sales. It was resolved that a letter should be sent to the Food Regulation Association urging it to quickly order cheaper overseas rice and collect the existing low-quality overseas rice and broken rice in Shanghai, and immediately organize discounted sales to help the common people. (3) A letter should be sent to the Food Regulation Association urging it to quickly expand the purchase of overseas rice. It was resolved that the Food Regulation Association is already organizing group purchases of overseas rice, but the association believes that it is necessary to expand the purchases, with each trade association as a unit. A letter should be sent to the association urging it to supervise each association to consider the food needs of Shanghai residents and work hard. If each association orders several thousand bags, the Shanghai food supply can be increased by hundreds of thousands of bags, and the city will not be short of supplies. In addition, a fundraising committee was established to raise funds for ordering overseas rice. The meeting adjourned at around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Rice Market Trends Towards Stability, Market Resumes Operations</p>
<p>The Rice Market Tea House Market, in commemoration of National Renaissance Day and to celebrate the Christmas holiday, the market management committee resolved to close for one day on the day before. Yesterday, operations resumed, and the market opened as usual at 9:00 AM. Rice shops were weak, and trading was not brisk. Rice shops in all districts have successively resumed operations in accordance with the authorities' wishes. It is understood that there are approximately 1,133 rice shops in the city, including 302 in the British Concession, 263 in the American Concession, and 146 in the western Shanghai area. All of these rice shops are formal members of the Rice Merchants Association.</p>
<p>Authorities Respond to Grain Storage Proposal</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation previously suggested to the authorities of the two concessions that they purchase and store grain as a precaution, considering the serious food situation. In addition to the French Municipal Council expressing sympathy, the federation received a reply from the Public Concession Municipal Council on the previous day, stating, "In response to your esteemed letter, it has been given sympathetic consideration by the council. It is the council's opinion that the establishment of grain warehouses is a good idea and the council fully agrees if it can be realized. However, it is the council's consistent principle that the operation of any goods should be undertaken by the business community. The establishment of grain warehouses is part of the rice business, so rice merchants should be responsible for it. The council is unable to engage in grain storage plans under the current circumstances. We have heard that private organizations are already purchasing overseas rice, and the council is very satisfied. What the council dares to tell your federation is that the council will give possible encouragement and convenience to those who purchase overseas rice."</p>
<p>Regulation Association Registers and Orders Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Regulation Association has passed fundraising measures, established advisory, purchasing, and fundraising committees, and hired a secretary. It will begin operations immediately and will begin registering orders for overseas rice today (December 27th). The measures for ordering overseas rice and application forms have been printed. Any organizations, agencies, companies, or factories that wish to order overseas rice can obtain application forms from the association (59 Hong Kong Road, Room 304) and fill them out according to the instructions.</p>
<h3>A Certain University Staff Member, Huang Xionglüe, is Shot, Hit by Two Bullets and Seriously Injured, Reasons for Assassination Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Huang Xionglüe, from Chaozhou, Guangdong, is 29 years old this year. He formerly served as the director of the Secretariat of South China University. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, he was introduced by a friend to work in the General Affairs Department of a certain university on Kangnao Road. Having been married for only three months, he rented a room on the third floor of the Ye family's house at No. 3 Hexing Lane, 42 Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Huang</p>
<p>left his residence, intending to go to the school to handle affairs. Unexpectedly, just as he stepped to the entrance of Hexing Lane, several thugs lying in wait there suddenly rushed out from the side. One of the thugs, wearing a gray suit and a black woolen coat, pulled out a pistol and fired four shots at Huang. Huang</p>
<p>was hit by one bullet in his right shoulder and another in his left waist. After being injured, he turned and ran back to the entrance of his residence, shouting for help. His wife heard the sound and ran out, intending to report to the patrol post. At this time, the thugs had not yet fled. Seeing Huang's wife running out, they raised their guns to shoot at her, but the bullet jammed. In fright, Huang's wife</p>
<p>shouted loudly and fell to the ground to avoid the bullets. At this time, passersby and patrolmen had heard the sound and gathered. The assassins had taken the opportunity to escape without a trace. The police then reported to the French Police Station by telephone, and an ambulance was immediately called to send Huang to Guangci Hospital. It is reported that Huang's bullets did not pass through</p>
<p>and that he was seriously injured and his life may be in danger. The police station has dispatched detectives to investigate the reason for Huang's assassination and to apprehend the criminals. It is also reported that Huang, while handling school affairs, was a patriotic person and had been threatened several times but refused to give in, which aroused suspicion from certain quarters. Before being shot yesterday morning, the thugs had tried to kidnap him but failed, so they shot him. As for the inside story, it is currently under investigation by the French Police Station.</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," a professor at a certain university, Huang Xionglüe, resides at No. 3, Lane 42, Shanzhong Road. This morning (December 26th), as he left his residence and had only walked a few steps, he was suddenly shot twice by two assassins. Huang was hit by one bullet in the stomach, and another bullet grazed his left arm, causing minor injuries. At the time of the incident, an elderly vendor was nearby and saw the two assassins loitering nearby before the incident, and witnessed the shooting. However, in a state of shock, he could only raise the alarm and report to the patrol after the two assassins boarded</p>
<p>a car parked on the side of the road and fled. The injured person was rushed to Guangci Hospital by ambulance. An operation was performed this morning. According to doctors, Huang's injuries are not serious and he should be able to recover. The case is still a mystery. Reliable sources in this city believe that there were political motives. However, Huang, when questioned by the French Concession Police Department, stated that he had no connection to politics</p>
<p>nor had he received any threatening letters. The motive for the shooting may be personal jealousy. According to the French Concession Police Department, Huang left his residence just after 9:00 AM this morning and was shot by assassins a few minutes later. The vendor who witnessed the event has been taken to the French Police Station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Certificates of Chinese Goods Must Not Be Issued Indiscriminately, Should Be Handled by the Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Has Separate Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to various trade associations, stating, "In response to the notice, we have recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Commercial Affairs Department, No. 39679, December, which states: Regarding the matter of certificates of Chinese goods, the Ministry has previously received a telegram from your Chamber of Commerce proposing provisional measures for issuing lists of Chinese goods certificates. The Ministry has made revisions, approved the implementation, and ordered compliance. In the future, regarding the matters of Chinese goods certificates within the Shanghai city area as stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the above-mentioned measures, your Chamber of Commerce should immediately handle them in accordance with the above-mentioned measures, and inform all other trade associations and Chinese goods manufacturers' organizations that they must not issue Chinese goods certificate lists indiscriminately. You are hereby ordered to comply. "The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's provisional measures for issuing lists of Chinese goods certificates proposed by the Chamber have been reviewed and revised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. However, the format of the certificate lists, which are related, is still under review by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Therefore, the articles of the measures for the certificate lists have not been notified to the associations in advance. In response to the above, the entire text of Article 2 of the measures is extracted and notified, hoping that you will investigate and handle them first. Attached is Article 2 of the provisional measures for issuing lists of Chinese goods certificates: For industrial products manufactured independently by Chinese factories in the Shanghai city area that have obtained certificates of Chinese goods from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and wish to sell them abroad or to various ports in China, they may apply to the Chamber for a list of Chinese goods certificates in accordance with these measures. The scope of the Shanghai city area is temporarily limited to the safe area within the two special districts and will be determined at any time depending on the actual situation. Article 3 states: For industrial products that have not yet obtained certificates of Chinese goods from the Ministry of Economic Affairs due to urgent shipping reasons, they may also apply to the Chamber for a list of Chinese goods certificates in accordance with these measures. However, within two months from the date of obtaining the list, they should apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for a certificate of Chinese goods in accordance with the prescribed procedures."</p>
<h3>Drawing of the National Reconstruction Bond Scheduled, Principal and Interest Over 11,540,000 Yuan, Payment Methods to be Announced by the Ministry of Finance at the Time</h3>
<p>In order to complete the legal tender policy, improve financial organization, support production and construction, balance national treasury revenue and expenditure, and allocate funds for stabilizing the bond market, the National Government issued the 25th Year of the Republic of China National Reconstruction Bond of 340 million yuan, with the customs surplus designated as the fund for principal and interest. The Ministry of Finance ordered the Director General of Customs to allocate the principal and interest due each month according to the principal and interest repayment schedule to the National Debt Fund Management Committee account of the Central Bank for special storage and payment. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the customs of Shanghai and Tianjin fell one after another, and customs duties were intercepted by the Japanese. Therefore, the principal and interest of the bond were forced to be temporarily suspended. However, in order to maintain creditworthiness, the seventh installment of principal and interest was discounted and paid by the four banks: Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank. The eighth drawing of principal repayment is scheduled for the 10th of the month by the National Debt Fund Management Committee, totaling 1.7 million yuan for principal repayment and 9,843,000 yuan for interest payment, with a total of 11,543,000 yuan for principal and interest. Payment will begin on February 28th. As for the payment methods, they will be announced by the Ministry at that time.</p>
<h3>Chinese Seamen Returning Home From Abroad, Travel Expenses are High, Living Conditions are Poor</h3>
<p>Over three hundred Chinese seamen who served on foreign merchant ships and became unemployed after the war have arrived in Shanghai one after another. According to the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency, the seamen who returned to Shanghai have been helped by various shipping organizations to find other means of livelihood. However, during this period of sparse foreign shipping, there are few suitable opportunities. Therefore, the majority of the seamen have recently gone to Zhejiang separately and transferred to their hometowns to seek other development opportunities. It is also understood that most of these seamen have served on German and Italian ships for many years. Before the war, their average monthly income was about 100 Chinese legal tender yuan, so their livelihoods were still relatively comfortable. After the war, the ships stopped sailing, and their livelihoods were not a problem for a short time. However, the travel expenses for returning home cost an average of 1,000 yuan per person. Therefore, their living conditions are extremely poor after returning home.</p>
<h3>Tax-Exempt Exports Exceeded Taxable Exports Last Month, Incentives for Exports Show Obvious Results</h3>
<p>The Customs announced the value of goods taxed and exempted for import and export in November of this year: (1) Taxable imports: 27,866,254 gold units, tax-exempt imports: 3,443,199 gold units; (2) Taxable exports: 61,975,858 yuan, tax-exempt exports: 71,739,192 yuan. The reason why tax-exempt exports exceeded taxable exports is due to the government's incentives for exporting domestic goods. Taxable imports at Jianghai Customs: 9,499,000 gold units, tax-exempt imports: 81,000 gold units; Taxable exports: 27,739,000 yuan, tax-exempt exports: 65,032,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Inspection at the Gap in North Jiangxi Road, Sometimes Strict, Sometimes Relaxed, Tightened the Day Before Yesterday, Eased Yesterday</h3>
<p>Starting the day before yesterday, the Japanese sentries at the gap in the barbed wire fence on North Jiangxi Road suddenly tightened their inspection of residents entering and exiting the gap. Those carrying heavy objects were required to open them for inspection, and those carrying heavy loads on their shoulders were prohibited from passing through the post, so the situation became tense. Starting yesterday, the above-mentioned tense atmosphere has eased. However, the Japanese sentries require those entering and exiting the gap to show "passes," but they no longer interrogate them. Furthermore, they do not restrict the month and year on the "passes" as they do at Xin Kaihe.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Fractional Currency Issued, Third Batch to be Issued Consecutively, 500,000 Yuan of Subsidiary Currency Arrives in Shanghai, Distributed to British Merchants and Already Circulating in the Market</h3>
<p>The panic over the shortage of fractional currency, subsidiary currency, and one-yuan currency in Shanghai has been addressed after the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Joint Office of the Four Banks, instructing the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to find ways to adjust the situation. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday: (1) Fractional currency: The second batch of 500,000 yuan has been issued, and the third batch has been printed by the American company Yong Ning and will be issued consecutively by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank. The method of issuance will still adopt a gradual system and will decide whether to print a fourth batch based on market needs. (2) Subsidiary currency: The 500,000 yuan previously shipped to Shanghai by the British HSBC Bank is the new edition of the 26th year of the Republic of China currency printed by the Chinese Da Ye Company for the Chinese Farmers Bank. It has already been distributed by HSBC Bank to British companies such as Yi Zhong, Lun Chang, and Yihe for paying workers' wages, and it is already circulating in the market. It is reported that this subsidiary currency was requested directly from the Head Office of the Chinese Farmers Bank by HSBC Bank on behalf of various British merchants, and was approved and shipped to Shanghai by foreign ships, and has nothing to do with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Farmers Bank. (3) One-yuan currency: After the new currency was shipped to the Central Bank and the Bank of China by the Central Bank and HSBC Bank, it has been widely circulated in the market.</p>
<h3>Excess Profits Tax to be Levied from New Year's Day, Tax Rates Have Been Lowered, Collected Annually According to Regulations</h3>
<p>The excess profits tax is an excellent wartime tax system. After the regulations were revised, they were promulgated on July 6th, 1939, raising the starting standard for the excess profits tax on business operations to 20% and the starting standard for the excess profits tax on property rentals to 15%. The tax rates have also been lowered at various times. It was stipulated that the tax would be levied from January 1, 1940. Now, the Ministry of Finance has decided to start levying the tax from January 1, 1940, that is, to collect the excess profits tax for 1939, and to collect it annually according to the regulations. After the levy begins, it will be able to increase tax revenue and provide sufficient war funds. Its important significance lies in realizing the principle of "those with money contributing money" to save the country and balancing the burden on society.</p>
<h3>Orphanage to Hold New Building Inauguration Ceremony and Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief of Refugee Children's Orphanage will hold a new building inauguration ceremony on New Year's Day. A preparatory meeting was held yesterday, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Print a special issue; (2) Send a letter to the members of the Shanghai Recreational and Entertainment Association to perform programs; (3) Announce the organizational outline of the Refugee Children's Disciplinary Corps; (4) Appoint the conference staff; (5) Send a letter to the film industry to film the lives of the orphanage children; (6) Approve the conference budget. In addition, more than a thousand pieces of calligraphy and painting that the orphanage had collected to raise construction funds are all valuable calligraphy and paintings from ancient and modern times. It is now heard that they will be publicly exhibited for five days starting on New Year's Day, and June 7th is the date for drawing lots and receiving items. Anyone with the orphanage's calligraphy and painting lottery tickets can draw lots and receive one piece of calligraphy and painting. It is reported that the exhibition will be held at the orphanage, and all are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3>Smooth Cargo Transportation in Eastern Zhejiang, Extended Inspection Time, Eight Hours Daily</h3>
<p>Recently, since the port of Zhenhai in eastern Zhejiang has been smoothly navigable, cargo transportation has been frequent. After a foreign ship successfully made a trial voyage to the port of Wenzhou, there is also a large accumulation of goods shipped from Shanghai to Wenzhou. There are also many domestic goods waiting to be shipped. According to shipping industry sources, in order to quickly process inspections and ensure smooth cargo transportation, the Zhejiang Customs has extended the daily inspection time from seven hours to eight hours of work. The headquarters of each defense command has also dispatched personnel to handle cargo inspection and transportation in order to promptly inspect and release import and export goods.</p>
<h3>Zhanghuabang Shipyard Not Returned, Huangpu River Dredging Postponed Indefinitely</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dredging Bureau's dredging and surveying vessels, as well as transportation launches, total more than 30. Apart from a small number that have been returned by the Japanese, most have not been returned, and the Zhanghuabang Shipyard has not been handed over. Furthermore, the above-mentioned vessels all require a considerable amount of time for inspection and repair. Therefore, the resumption of dredging work is not certain. The bureau's dredging work outside the mouth of Wusong includes various parts of the Yangtze River estuary and Shentan. Although dredging has been suspended for a long time and silt has accumulated, the bureau's dredging department has decided to start dredging simultaneously when dredging work on the Huangpu River resumes. However, there are no preparations to continue dredging the Wusong River (i.e., Suzhou Creek), as this section of the project is not within the scope of the Huangpu River dredging. Whether or not to dredge it will be considered.</p>
<h3>Employment Agencies Increase Referral Fees</h3>
<p>Prices in Shanghai continue to rise, and various industries have repeatedly announced price increases. It is now learned that the employment referral industry (i.e., employment agencies) in the city will also increase the commission charged for referring jobs, starting in January. This adds another burden to the working class. The industry's announcement is recorded below: "Since commodity prices have been rising rapidly, the responsibilities borne by our industry have also increased, and the cost of living is rising daily, and expenses are increasing. We have been bearing the pain until now, and although we want to make a difficult effort, we cannot do so. Therefore, we have convened a joint meeting of the industry in the city and resolved that, starting on January 1st of the new year, the original referral fees will be: (1) Aunts and elder sisters will be increased by 10%; (2) Wet nurses will be increased by 20%; Male workers will be increased by 20%, as a means of compensation. This is a forced measure, and we hope for understanding from all sectors."</p>

<h3>Large Fire in West Shanghai Yesterday Morning: Over Two Hundred Thatched Sheds Burned; Fire Also Reported on Yidingpan Road</h3>
<p>Over two hundred households of thatched sheds were built opposite Huayuan Village on Bailinan Road, near the intersection of Kaixuan Road in West Shanghai. The residents are all working class. The day before yesterday, the weather was very cold. Gao Xueyou, a 41-year-old resident of the sheds, was using a coal stove for heating. Around 2:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out due to carelessness. Because the structures were thatched sheds, they were highly flammable.</p>
<p>The fire spread rapidly, flames soaring and darting about uncontrollably. Residents were awakened from their sleep and scrambled to escape, carrying the elderly and children. Their cries of grief were heartbreaking. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade in West Shanghai and the Public Concession Fire Brigade responded and rushed to the scene. However, the fireground was vast and the fire spread in all directions.</p>
<p>Extinguishing the fire was difficult, and it was not until 4:20 AM that it was put out. All of the more than two hundred thatched sheds were reduced to ashes. Fortunately, no one was burned to death, but the residents are now without shelter, waiting outside the fireground for relief. With the biting north wind, their suffering is unimaginable. Furthermore, the Jin Yuan Confectionery, located at No. 20, Yangzi Village, Lane 95, Yidingpan Road, Bailinan Road, was opened by Shen Rengeng from Shaoxing.

<h3>Assassination Attempt on Yidingpan Road Yesterday Afternoon: Assailants Used Axes to Attack; Victim Named Guo Baojin</h3>
<p>Around 11:20 AM yesterday, an assassination attempt occurred near the intersection of Bailinan Road and Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai. The victim, Guo Baojin, 36 years old, was passing through the area when he was suddenly attacked by four assailants wielding two axes.

On September 7th, around 3:00 PM, Jiang Qian, an old woman from Shaoxing residing at No. 361, Haining Road, and Cai Xuzhou, Ni Wang's lover, under the pretext of introducing Meiying to work at a yarn factory in Yangshupu, colluded with Chen Liu, an old woman from Anhui, and sold Meiying to Wang Laosi, a procuress at No. 19, Rue Tenant de St. Paul in the French Concession, for 220 yuan to work as a prostitute. After the crime, Ni Wang reported to the Gordon Road police station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Jiang Qian, Chen Liu, Cai Xuzhou, and the suspect Chen Aliang from Ningbo and transferred them to the First Special District Court. Ni Meiying and Wang Laosi, the procuress, could not be found. After interrogation, they waited for the announcement of the verdict.

However, the number of male suicides still exceeds more than half the number from last month, which is deeply regrettable. The Music Committee of the American Community Church held a concert on November 30th, donating two-thirds of all proceeds to the hospital. The church's righteous act is inspiring for the hospital's work. The concert was a success, and the audience praised it endlessly.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, On Friday morning, after the deadline for responding to our requests submitted to the company authorities had passed (originally limited to two days for a reply, but it was already the fourth day) without any news, we, the factory workers, immediately elected representative Mr. He Junyue to meet with the factory manager. With no results, we then implemented a slowdown. The company then requested the police station to send police to the factory to drive out the workers and used White Russian workers, using high-pressure tactics, resulting in a conflict. At the time, we were all unarmed, and it was difficult to resist, resulting in several workers suffering injuries of varying degrees. Representative He Junyue was also arrested. When the news reached the Shanghai head office and the wharves in Pudong, all employees were indignant and also implemented a slowdown in response. Around 2:00 PM, Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industry Section of the Public Works Bureau intervened to mediate, releasing the arrested representative and persuading the workers to return to work. The demands made will be discussed further after the company director returns to Shanghai from Japan. As a result, the employees at the head office and the two wharves in Pudong resumed work one after another, and all workers at this factory also resumed work today. This is the factual account of the events, and there was no involvement from the Fuyi Society or Japanese military police. This matter concerns the reputation of all employees, so we have specifically clarified the truth in order to distinguish right from wrong. Please publish this in your newspaper's Letter to the Editor column. Sincerely, All Workers of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Yangshupu. December 24th.</p>

<h3>The Only Weapon to Control the War: British Coal Exports on the Rise (Part 1) German Coal Unable to Communicate Transport Outlets; American Coal Subsidized for Export to South America</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Since the European war began, Germany's victory over Poland has created an excellent opportunity to restore the British Empire's coal export trade. In the past, British coal exports could not compete with those of Poland and Germany. According to coal exporters, based on economic news reports, the disappearance of German ships at sea is Britain's opportunity. Only the Baltic Sea route is still open. Germany's domestic needs are great, and land transportation is very difficult, so Germany's coal exports are bound to be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Neutral countries currently harbor excessive expectations for coal, as coal is a wartime weapon. As a result, British coal exports are presented with an opportunity. Britain has jumped to become the central seller to various countries. At the same time, Britain especially hopes to gain a foothold in South American countries with its wartime coal products to satisfy the desire of those in need. This is Britain's recent export trade policy. The sudden outbreak of World War II caused the Allied forces of Britain and France to come to blows with Germany. Both sides consumed huge amounts of coal in the war. German coal exports fell from 18,313,000 tons in 1932 to the current 29,640,000 tons. Among those dependent on Germany, France and Italy were the largest. In recent years, 1937 saw 8,000,000 tons, double the 4,000,000 tons in 1932. Sales to Italy in 1937 were 7,930,000 tons, more than five times the 1,440,000 tons in 1932, an even greater increase. German coal sales in other smaller markets were most significant in Canada and the countries of the South American Federation, which cannot be ignored. From 1932 to last year, German coal sales to Canada accounted for 388,000 tons, and exports to the South American Federation totaled 963,000 tons. Polish coal export trade has gradually grown in recent years, and coal production has become spectacular. In 1938, Polish coal exports totaled 11,687,000, nearly half of which flowed to the Scandinavian countries and France and Italy, which were formerly British coal markets. Polish coal exports to France and Italy were the highest in 1932 and 1938. At this time, Britain could not match and fell behind. In the past seven years, due to the increase in ship freight, the export volume of Germany and Poland has invisibly increased by nearly 9 million tons, while British coal has fallen by 5.5 million tons.</p>
<p>1938 was the worst year for German coal export trade. The coal imported into France from Germany and Poland was only 7 million tons. The main reason for the decline was British coal gaining ground. The growing Polish coal market was also almost swept away by British coal. Polish coal exports — outside the scope of trade treaties — have been steadily increasing in recent years. In 1934, production reached 436,000 tons (or 2.5% of total European coal), while in 1938, Polish coal exports had climbed to 1,839,000 tons (or 11.4% of total European coal). In the same year, British coal fell to 3 million tons. Recently, British coal has closely followed the footsteps of German and Polish and invaded French coal trade. What we know is that British coal is making extensive progress and driving German and Polish coal out.</p>
<p>The situation for coal in Italy is very simple. In recent years, the production of coal in the Ruhr and Silesian regions of Italy has been high. It was shipped by ship to areas south of Switzerland. Since the outbreak of World War II, Italy has stopped shipping and is in a state of stagnation. The reasons for the stagnation are (1) Switzerland does not allow the supply of railways as a thoroughfare, (2) There are no German freight cars available for transportation, and (3) Germany itself has enough coal in storage to meet its own needs. Due to the difficulty of transportation in Poland, although Germany occupies half of Poland, it has not been able to mine Polish coal to this day. Another reason is that Germany wants to do its best to prevent coal exports and maintain its original raw materials for its own supply. The only exports are to exchange for its necessities. Trade negotiations between Britain and Italy are currently underway. Coal from South Wales in Britain hopes to be sold to Italy in large quantities, with the aim of signing a reciprocal treaty. The negotiations between the two parties are progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>At the same time, according to reports, Spain did not need foreign coal in the past, but since the civil war, Spain has been urgently seeking foreign coal supplies. Therefore, Britain is also a great opportunity for dumping.</p>
<p>As for the coal market in the Baltic Sea countries, it is quite bleak and fragile. After the outbreak of the war, Germany has no scruples about the Anglo-French front. Germany controls the Baltic Sea and has an absolute advantage. Since the outbreak of the war, they can contribute as much coal, iron, food and wartime military supplies to Germany as possible. Moreover, since Poland and Germany are connected, Germany is even more complacent. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Temperatures Drop Below Freezing Again: Frozen Corpses of Beggars Everywhere; Total Reaches 51 Large and Small in Two Days</h3>
<p>The weather in this city has recently become severely cold again, causing beggars who sleep on the streets to freeze to death everywhere, a tragic situation. According to the Datong News Agency's inquiry with the observatory, due to the cold wave of high pressure in this city, the temperature every morning from 5 to 6 AM has fallen below 0 degrees Celsius. The biting north wind is blowing and the weather is extremely cold, making it difficult for refugees and beggars to survive the severe winter. In the past two days, dozens of beggars have frozen to death. According to the Pushan Villa, the number of beggar corpses collected on the 24th was 18 large and 6 small. On the 25th, another 23 large and 4 small were collected. In the two days, there were a total of 51 corpses. The most frequently discovered locations are in the central district, especially along Shilu, Wuhu Road, and Shanxi Road. Secondly, the Jing'an Temple Road and Da Xi Road areas in the west district are also quite frequently discovered, causing the collection vehicles to travel back and forth frequently, making the work extremely busy.</p>

<h3>Grain: Dumi Still Lacking in Arrivals; Japonica and Indica Sold at 40 Yuan; Price Limits Ineffectively Again; Foreign Rice Market Prices Rise in Japan</h3>
<p>Since the rice market was closed for one day in commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising of the Previous Dynasty, yesterday, general stores purchased a lot more. In the early market, the inland sources were still not much, and peddlers also sought to sell, so the transaction was very prosperous for a while. Foreign rice was still the majority, and japonica and indica rice were only ornaments. During this period of brisk sales, the market gradually increased. However, because there were plenty of chips on the market, although Saigon rice opened at 38 yuan and was gradually called to 38.5 yuan, it was difficult to do so. The closing price was still 38 yuan, only 2 or 3 cents higher than before. Broken rice initially opened at 33.3 yuan, then 33.5 yuan, an increase of 3 to 5 cents before and after. Romanian rice closed at 38.5 yuan. Tokyo polished rice was particularly special at 35.5 yuan, then 34.5 yuan. The market situation was similar to that of Qugong rice. As for the thick and thin japonica rice opened, the thick japonica was only Sutong goods. If Tongli and Lisheng japonica rice were all limited to 40 yuan. Qingsi high thin also opened at 40 yuan. Fengjia and other early and late rice opened high at 40 yuan, and the middle section was 39.5 yuan. Lu Jianzhen was particularly special at 40 yuan, with middle and second grades priced separately. Yang Jian was 39.5 yuan, 39 yuan. However, because Tokyo polished rice had reached 34.5 yuan, if the passenger tips were sold at the limited price of 33 yuan, it would indeed be a loss of 3 or 4 yuan. Therefore, general goods owners modestly sold them, resulting in no transactions. There are many ways to change the yuan, but there are not many goods on the market, so the market is particularly brisk. It is estimated that no less than 7 or 8 thousand bags were traded in the city. There are no hoarders on the market, and all are normal transactions, so although people's hearts are good, the market only fluctuates by 3 or 5 cents. However, if the inland sources continue in this way and are cut off for a long time, relying only on some foreign rice will delay the future of Shanghai rice. Therefore, it is urgent to negotiate and restore the source.</p>
<p>A few hundred bags of Jiangbei indica rice arrived at the port yesterday. However, because the cost of Jiangbei indica rice was more than 35 yuan, there were calls for 36 yuan. It is said that dark market transactions have been completed many times, and they have been reported and warned. However, low-grade indica rice in the market still sells at the limited price of 33 yuan, but most of them hoard and refuse to sell.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 10,000 bags of foreign rice were loaded on the Taikoo Chongqing ship, and there were also many scattered tickets transferred from Hong Kong. However, after the shop made the country guest's stomach prosperous, the prices of various rice increased step by step. Saigon and Weigao grades all reached 38.5 yuan, and high broken rice also reached 34 yuan. The original package spot price rose to 46.4 yuan, which is 5 or 6 cents higher than the spot price last week, and the original package rose by nearly 1 yuan. Foreign rice has been opening higher and higher every day, so the authorities are also planning to limit prices.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw no significant fluctuations. Second-grade flour remained at eight yuan and seventy cents. Demand from buyers was also very subdued, with only over twenty thousand packages changing hands. There was little activity in terms of goods returning to or leaving storage. It is said that the Japanese-made Phoenix brand flour for this month is nearing its end-of-month expiration, leading to some pressure on short sellers. The price opened at eight yuan, one dime, and three cents. The January situation remains steady.</p>
<p>The supply of wheat saw a slight improvement yesterday. Several thousand packages arrived over the past few days, mostly stored in warehouses awaiting higher prices. Mills are not eager to buy raw materials, nor are commodity brokers. However, sellers are holding firm. It is said that mills are asking for up to fifteen yuan for two to three thousand packages, with slight variations for medium quality. The market is stagnant.</p>
<h3>Soybean Speculation Revives</h3>
<p>Given that oil prices have not suffered excessive declines, soybean speculation has generally become more active. Although market prices have not seen drastic changes, the underlying strength is evident due to limited supply, making the price base quite firm. Yesterday, statistics showed over two hundred packages of Jiangbei beans trading at sixteen yuan, over one thousand packages of Dingjia Zhou beans trading from seventeen yuan and fifty cents to eighteen yuan, seven or eight truckloads of Nanjing beans trading from sixteen yuan to seventeen yuan and one dime, and five to six hundred packages of Wuhu beans trading from seventeen yuan and fifty cents to eighteen yuan. Exports remain stagnant, with speculation accounting for three-quarters of the demand, followed by local street trade.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Stable</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter securities market was quiet yesterday. As the two-day market closure ended, hopes for peace remained strong, boosting confidence. However, with foreign exchange and gold still suspended, morale was low, leading to very light trading. On the official exchange, activity was minimal due to a lack of customer interest, resulting in only minor price fluctuations. Some financial institutions sold off their holdings, suppressing potential gains and keeping prices flat. In the morning, Xie Da saw strong selling, and Lian Yi San Kai also saw some offloading. Hong Kang, Ding Kang, Shun Tai, and retail investors bought in, slightly strengthening prices. In the afternoon, Hong Da and Mao Tai showed some demand, but in small quantities, leaving the market flat. Ultimately, all categories except Ding experienced a two-cent increase, while Yi remained unchanged. Total trading volume amounted to just over thirty thousand yuan. A summary is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading saw thirty shares of the Commercial Press stock change hands at sixty-eight yuan per share.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Nanyang Cotton Goods Sought in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Sales of Nanyang cotton cloth were brisk yesterday. Demand from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Tianjin merchants also increased. Local traders and speculators were actively seeking supplies, pushing prices higher. Fine cloth and fine twill increased by ten to twenty cents per bolt, while bleached and printed cloth increased by one dime to five dimes. The British firms Jardine Matheson and Wheelock Marden had the best sales. Coarse cloth and bleached cloth continued to rise by twenty-five to fifty cents. Over ten thousand bolts of Hong Yang Biao bleached cloth were procured for Siam, Singapore, and other overseas locations. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants purchased over one hundred pieces of bleached cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Tianjin merchants purchased nearly one hundred pieces of twill poplin. Local street trading involved over six hundred pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, bleached cloth, and twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, the market was closed due to foreign firms observing a holiday. However, due to Tianjin merchants procuring over five hundred pieces of mid- to low-grade fine cloth, the market was buoyant, and asking prices were quite high. The selling price of fine cloth increased by fifty to sixty cents per bolt compared to last week, and fine twill increased by thirty to forty cents. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth saw increasing local trading, closing at twenty-two yuan and one dime in the evening, with a very firm trend.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Post-Holiday Yarn and Cotton Remain Strong, Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The yarn market is increasingly stable, with a positive trend, but actual sales remain sluggish. However, general market sentiment is that mills cannot profit due to production costs, so those with ample capital are not bearish on yarn prices, buying in several hundred packages. Although spot yarn business is quiet, confidence remains high, and prices are rising. Overall, the underlying fundamentals are strong, but actual demand remains weak, which will limit significant price increases.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened this morning with foreign cotton and exchange rates still suspended due to the holiday. Market sentiment was peaceful, with traders generally bullish. Twenty-count Double Horse opened at seven hundred and thirty-five yuan, similar to the afternoon price from the previous day. After some long positions were closed, it fell slightly by two yuan. However, a speculator, anticipating a higher market opening, suddenly bought one to two hundred packages, tightening the market to seven hundred and thirty-six yuan at closing. Statistics for half-day trading showed twenty-count Double Horse up four yuan, Tian Nv up one yuan, and Double Earth up two yuan. Yong An Factory offered thirty-two count, fifteen packages of special Jin Cheng at nine hundred and thirty-five yuan. The quantities purchased by various merchant groups are listed below: Local Traders: 1,630; Mainland: 190; Hong Kong: 130; Total: 1,950.</p>
<p>Cotton trading remains quiet. Mills are only packing and not buying. Trading among merchants is also less active than before, as everyone prepares to close out business during this Lunar New Year period, and business activity is somewhat relaxed. However, prices remain up by one to two yuan. Supplies from northern Jiangsu continue to arrive. During these days of market closure, a total of nine thousand eight hundred and seventy-one packages of Tonghua cotton arrived, and two thousand one hundred and eighty-one packages of Changyinsha cotton. The spot cotton situation is listed below: Bei Tai Hua: 164.00; Traded 30 packages among merchants. Huo Ji Cao: 157.00; Another 145 packages; Another 160.00; Another 420 packages. Tongzhou Hua: 170.00; Another 100 packages; Another 168.00; Tongcheng bought 300 packages.</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Market Slightly Weak, Jewelry Gold Unchanged</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter spot gold market saw no trading yesterday due to the Christmas holiday market closure. Normal trading will resume today. Over-the-counter trading did occur, with a generally stable trend. A money exchange dealer offered four thousand one hundred and forty-five yuan, but the market weakened due to rumors of Sino-Japanese peace. Securities brokers sold off a hundred and several tens of taels on behalf of multiple clients, causing the price to gradually decrease from four thousand one hundred and forty-five yuan to four thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. Jewelry stores absorbed most of the supply. In the late afternoon, there were still sellers at four thousand one hundred and thirty-two or thirty-three yuan, down about three to four yuan from the closing price last weekend.</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold jewelry remained unchanged throughout the day. Da Tong Hang still quoted four hundred and twenty yuan per tael, and Xin Tong Hang quoted the same price, with a fifteen-yuan reduction for purchases.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Unchanged</h3>
<p>The discount rate for bills of exchange remained between thirty-eight and thirty-nine yuan per thousand yesterday, ultimately settling at thirty-eight yuan and fifty cents, the same as last Saturday. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 1.5 cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Brown Sugar Down Five Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was flat, with little fluctuation. The Shanghai Sugar Merchant Association's benchmark price for spot raw white sugar was fifty-eight yuan and fifty cents for warehouse goods, fifty-eight yuan and fifty to thirty cents for newly arrived goods in outside warehouses, fifty-eight yuan for old goods, and forty-eight yuan for transshipment goods. Taikoo granulated white sugar B Mark was fifty-eight yuan for East Warehouse and fifty-eight yuan and fifty cents for West Warehouse. CW Mark was fifty-eight yuan and two dimes, CX Mark was fifty-seven yuan and seven dimes, DY Mark was fifty-six yuan and five dimes for East Warehouse and fifty-six yuan for West Warehouse, and HX Mark was fifty-six yuan for West Warehouse. H Mark raw red sugar was forty-four yuan and five dimes, and Dutch red sugar was forty-six yuan to forty-five yuan and five dimes, all down by five cents. The prices for local Number One white sugar and Number One rock sugar remained unchanged. Chaozhou merchants offered several tens of packages of high-quality rock sugar at fifty-six yuan and five dimes and over fifty packages of Qibai sugar at fifty yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Quanzhou Dried Longan Supply to be Disrupted</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from suppliers of Quanzhou dried longan, stocks are dwindling, and purchase prices have increased by five yuan. Furthermore, transportation is being obstructed by certain parties, threatening to disrupt the supply. Therefore, local merchants will likely raise prices for the goods they already have in stock, starting today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Coal: Abundant Hai Feng Coal Supply</h3>
<p>The supply of Hai Feng white coal has suddenly become abundant recently. Over nine hundred tons arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Dealers and speculators have ample stock, leading floating traders to sell off. Over-the-counter prices are somewhat weak. Hai Feng lump coal is priced at one hundred and twenty yuan per ton. Speculators' warehouse receipts are discounted by two to three yuan. Local shops are selling screened lump coal at one hundred and twenty-eight yuan, or six yuan and four dimes per dan.</p>
<h3>Statistics: Price Changes</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>October and November</p>
<p>The pace of price increases in Shanghai during October and November was significantly slower compared to September. This is because the previous price increases were excessive, and further increases would undoubtedly lead to consumer abandonment. Therefore, the price increases during these two months were less pronounced than in the previous month. The following is an analysis of the price increases during October and November:</p>
<p>There were a total of sixty-six price increases in October, meaning sixty-six businesses increased their prices. This is a decrease of seventy-one from the one hundred and thirty-seven increases in September. These sixty-six price increases can be categorized into thirteen groups: food and beverages, daily necessities, clothing, medicine, candles and foil, electricity, decoration, culture and printing, cosmetics, travel, civil engineering, specialty items, and packaging. Daily necessities accounted for the most increases, with fourteen, ranking first. Medicine was second with nine increases. Food and beverages and travel were third with eight increases each. Clothing and metal and electricity were fourth with six increases each. Culture and printing and civil engineering were fifth with four increases each. Candles and foil and specialty items were sixth with two increases each. Cosmetics, packaging, and decoration were at the bottom with one increase each. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Overview of This Year's Unified University Entrance Examination (50)</h3>
<p>(3) The Need for Academic Guidance: The concentration of student preferences in the unified examination reveals that, on one hand, it reflects the needs of the times and the country. On the other hand, it clearly lacks guidance for academic pursuits. Choosing good schools is naturally a common desire among students, but the selection of departments often does not align with their academic abilities and interests. The results of last year's unified examination showed a particularly large number of students applying to engineering departments, leading to high acceptance rates. However, due to poor academic interest and performance, many students requested transfers to other departments or faculties after one year. This year's situation is generally similar. Among many unaccepted students, we found that their academic performance did not match their desired departments. For example, some students scored zero in mathematics and had poor scores in physics and chemistry, yet their three choices were all engineering. Some had English scores below five, yet they applied to foreign language departments. Some had zero in chemistry, yet they applied to the chemistry department. Some had very poor geography and history scores, yet they applied to the history department. How can someone with zero in mathematics and poor physics and chemistry scores study engineering? How can someone with poor English study foreign languages? How can someone with zero in chemistry study chemistry? These students clearly did not assess their own abilities before applying and randomly filled out their choices. Some students even chose schools and departments that do not exist at the schools they applied to. They did not even understand whether their desired departments existed at the schools, let alone distinguish the merits of different departments. This shows that academic guidance for secondary school students is indeed necessary. In the future, secondary schools should conduct more individual investigations and provide detailed guidance on students' personalities, interests, academic abilities, and aspirations. Universities and educational administrative bodies should also pay attention to this issue and compile specialized books introducing university programs so that prospective students are not at a loss. Choosing unwisely, having incompatible interests, or lacking sufficient academic ability can lead to confusion and even misdirection for students and a significant loss for the country.</p>
<p>(4) Improvements in Examination Administration: Judging from the results of the unified examinations over the past two years, the administration and examination methods can be considered relatively rigorous and satisfactory. However, there are still many areas that need improvement. First is the issue of grading. This year's examination questions were unified, and the Ministry of Education made great efforts in sending questions and invigilators. It can be said that the establishment of the unified examination system is based on the unification of examination questions. However, although the questions are unified, the grading cannot be unified. Therefore, the leniency of grading and the adjustment of scores must still be adopted. Centralized grading, as I mentioned in the second section, is difficult to achieve due to various practical difficulties, and the method of regional grading must be adopted. Grading is the most important aspect of the examination. The selection of graders must be cautious, and the guidelines for questions and grading standards must be carefully stipulated. According to the current method, the question-setting committee drafts the grading standards for each question, and the graders grade each question separately and assign scores. This method is good, but the standards can be further refined. Ideally, the question-setting committee should create a set of model answers that specify the full score for answering the entire question correctly, a certain score for the correct theory but incorrect method, and a certain score for a partially correct method or answering a specific aspect of the question. The various possible answers for each question can be analyzed in detail, and the sum of the scores for each part of a question is the total score for that question, and the sum of the scores for each question is the total score for the subject. However, the unified examination is not a standardized test. It is impossible to achieve the objectivity of a standardized test, but the more detailed the analysis, the more objective the results can be. Second is the issue of preferences and allocation. According to the unified examination method, candidates can apply for three preferences. Those who choose departments in Group Two as their first preference can choose departments in Group Three as their other preferences. Those who apply to Groups One and Three cannot choose departments in Group Two as their preferences. The reason is that the mathematics examination for Group Two is more advanced, and physics and chemistry are required subjects, so taking Group Three is not a problem. They only need to take an additional examination in biology or foreign history and geography.</p>
<h3>Nanjiao Academy Sets New Year's Day for New Building Inauguration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief and Education Center for Refugee Children has been established for over a year. The center has built twenty-eight new buildings at 99, Alley 258, Wuding Road since September this year. After moving into the new location for education and care, the number of refugees has increased to five hundred and seventeen. With the diligent planning of the center's Chairman Yuan Ludeng, Director Lu Wentao, General Secretary Yuan Mingjun, and Deputy General Secretary Yu Jingqing, the center's operations have gradually developed, resulting in remarkable achievements. The center is scheduled to hold the inauguration ceremony of the new buildings on New Year's Day and will publicly exhibit thousands of collected paintings and calligraphy works for five days. Anyone holding a painting and calligraphy gift certificate can draw lots to claim the item.</p>
<h3>Education Briefs</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary celebration of Zhizhong Girls' High School. A dinner was held at the YMCA, attended by over one hundred teachers, students, and alumni. Principal Chen Naiwen reported on the school's development. School board members Jiang Zhuzhuang and Shan Meishu gave speeches. It is reported that the school is scheduled to hold entrance examinations for new students on January 25.</p>
<p>Huaguang Amateur Night Middle School has been reorganized into a drama college, with the appointment of department heads. It will be established from the next semester. The YMCA's Boys' Department is training children leaders to promote moral, intellectual, physical, and social education. Movie star Huang Liushuang has established a modern film drama college, scheduled to open on New Year's Day next year. The examination of teachers for the Poor Children's Education Relief Center has been completed and will be announced in January. The Lian Girls' Department and affiliated primary school of Jianshu Middle School held their fourth anniversary celebration on the morning of the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Failure Analysis</p>
<p>The Hu Lian team's crushing defeat yesterday, although attributed to unfamiliar playing conditions, was not accidental. The strength of the West United team is widely recognized. Veteran Cos Tay anchored the center, displaying impressive command. Harrison and Kaimo, as the two defenders, acted as impenetrable gates. Although Robasstof was absent, Fun's inclusion still made the team very active. The blonde Frazer ran across the entire field. However, Hu Lian might have had a chance if they had prepared to meet the challenge. Unfortunately, their key defender Li Yichen was injured in the match against the Russian team and could not participate. Sun Jinshun replaced Li in that position. Sun was not accustomed to the position, and Huang Kehou was also relatively weak. As a result, the ball constantly came from that direction. With such a defense, the attack was also weaker. The five forwards must have a leader to command the army and direct the battle. The three commanders, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, and Li Yichen, were either sick, injured, or repositioned. Although A Kui was good, he was not a commander. Furthermore, A Kui was injured and left the field early in the game. With this lineup, how could they not be defeated? However, the severity of the defeat was unexpected by the twenty thousand spectators. Ambassador Cole kicked off the game (photo by Zhang Hong).</p>
<p>A Tragic Start</p>
<p>Hu Lian attacking towards the sun was already a disadvantage, and it was one of the main reasons for conceding two goals within the first two minutes of the game. British Ambassador Sir Cole kicked the ball towards the West United side, where Cos Tay received it. He passed it to Thompson, who attacked along the sideline and reached the penalty area, where Zhuang Youren blocked the ball. Huang Kehou committed a foul near the center line. Kaimo took the free kick, shooting the ball straight from thirty yards. Fun jumped up and headed the ball, but Bi Gao was blinded by the sun and failed to catch it. The ball bounced and went into the goal. This happened only one minute into the game. After the kickoff at the center line, Fun dribbled and shot at the goal. Zhuang Youren dived to block the ball, but Bi Gao repeated his mistake, and the ball went straight into the net. Within two minutes, Hu Lian conceded two goals, shocking the audience. After fifteen minutes, Youliang received a pass from Qi Xiang, dribbled into the center, and Wen Kui headed the ball, but was knocked unconscious and carried off the field. Hu Lian was then forced to play with ten men, making the situation even more unfavorable.</p>
<p>Four Consecutive Goals</p>
<p>The Hu Lian team launched a counterattack. Yi Liang passed to Qiu Ting, who shot, but the ball hit Kaimo and bounced back into the Hu Lian side. After twenty-eight minutes, Parr broke past Sun Jinshun, who fell to the ground. Fun shot powerfully from twenty yards and scored, making it three to zero. Five minutes later, Wen Kui勉强 returned to the field, but did not regain his normal form. Hu Lian substituted Xu Chongru in and regained some momentum. Wen Kui passed to Qi Xiang, who passed the ball to the right. Youliang hooked a shot, but Willie blocked it. Youliang was determined and crossed the ball in front of the goal. Wen Kui headed the ball again, but Willie was already out and about to block. Everyone thought it was a sure goal, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced down. Dou Wen trapped the ball and shot again, but it was also futile. Two and a half minutes before the end of the first half, Youren saved the ball, resulting in a corner kick. Thompson crossed the ball, and it bounced off the post and into the goal. West United led by four goals.</p>
<p>A Futile Struggle</p>
<p>As the second half began, Hu Lian continued with ten men as Xu Wen Kui was too injured to play. At the same time, Qiu Ting and Dou Wen switched positions. West United kicked off and attacked again. The ball was won by the Hu Lian side. Qiu Ting passed to Dou Wen, who shot powerfully, but failed to break through Willie's defense. The Hu Lian team struggled hard. After eight minutes, Dou Wen lived up to expectations, receiving a cross from Youliang and shooting low from twenty-five yards, scoring a clear and beautiful goal. There was thunderous applause, redeeming one goal. Shortly after, Parr crossed the ball, and Yi Liang blocked it, resulting in a corner kick. Parr took the kick, and Jinshun failed to block the ball. The ball hit the goalpost but did not move. Fortunately, Bi Gao picked it up and kicked it out. After fifteen minutes, Jem took a free kick, MacLard headed the ball to Parr, and MacFunn connected with a shot, but Bi Gao blocked all the attempts. Finally, Fun scored, making it five to two. Subsequently, Youliang, with the assistance of Qi Xiang, spun around and unleashed a powerful shot. The ball flew like an arrow, but Willie caught it and shook, but did not slip. After nineteen minutes, he built another attack, adding to the half dozen. Five minutes later, Youliang secretly passed the ball, Qiu Ting threaded a pass, and Dou Wen shot powerfully. Willie caught the ball but dropped it again. Youliang rushed in and broke the net, sealing the six-to-two victory.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Christmas charity Mailing Engineer Cup game between Hua Lian and West United took place at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. The Chinese and Western elites gathered for a game. Fans, remembering the excitement of the last charity match, rushed to the venue yesterday, packing the north and south stands of Yiyuan, creating a sea of people. It was a scene rarely seen since the Sixth National Games, with an estimated attendance of over 20,000 people, generating revenue of around 15,000 to 16,000 yuan. Unfortunately, the Hu Lian team had bad luck yesterday, suffering an unprecedented defeat of 2-6. Conceding four goals in the first half proved fatal. Although they fought hard in the second half, scoring two goals each, it was not enough, and they ultimately suffered a crushing defeat, disappointing the 20,000 fans.

<h3>A Comfort to "New Postal Workers"</h3>
<p>— Qiang Gong</p>
<p>It is said that working in the post office, customs, and bank are three "gilded rice bowls." The new postal workers and other new workers who passed the postal service examination this time, in addition to feeling "happy and excited," are indeed considered, in the face of the continuously increasing unemployment and the waves of life impacting and even forcing living beings into hardship in Shanghai, as a fortunate encounter that cannot but be recognized as a cause for celebration.</p>
<p>In their appeals, the new postal workers have raised the issue of the unequal treatment between "those selected to work in the post office" and "those assigned to the post office." This is indeed a problem that those who rely on salaries for a living in this time and place must argue for based on reason.</p>
<p>However, both the Post Office and the Savings and Remittance Bureau are directly under the Postal Administration Bureau, and the Postal Administration Bureau is a directly subordinate organ of the Ministry of Transportation. Therefore, its administration and the selection of personnel are naturally governed by special regulations, so there should be no unwarranted changes that would lead to preferential treatment and discrimination against new postal workers. If promotions and salary levels are based on the rules of selection and in accordance with the legal procedures, then not only should the new postal workers abide by them, but the old postal workers should also strive to comply.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, working under a government-administered agency—especially in a post office, which has a reputation for rigorous evaluation and fair selection—a new employee need not have any doubts. Moreover, the original letter stated that "the postal authorities claim that there is no discrimination and that everyone is serving the country..." This should further encourage the new postal workers to serve with loyalty and dedication! Even if the authorities temporarily act in a way that seems unfair, it should not be to target individuals or "young friends." This is something that can be reassured.</p>
<p>The problem lies in whether to be sent to work in the interior. Most people prefer to work in Shanghai. Hearing about being sent to the interior makes them turn pale. Some are indeed due to the high expectations of their parents; others are due to their wives and children being afraid of the hardships of long-distance travel. However, the statement that "ordinary meals cost sixty to seventy yuan per month, plus twenty to thirty yuan per month for rent" is somewhat exaggerated. Even if it exists, it is not the case everywhere in the interior.</p>
<p>In reality, going to the interior is good, the interior is better than Shanghai. Although the cost of living in the interior is higher, many local specialties are not that high. Ordinary people are still surviving, so why can't people from urban areas live in the interior? Moreover, the postal authorities will certainly not disregard the "hardships" of those who work in the interior. Therefore, it is hoped that the new postal workers will wait for the bureau to assign them. Why appeal?</p>
<h3>Mr. Huang Pintang, a Colleague at This Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Shen Fugen</p>
<p>Just moments before his illness, his demeanor was peaceful and relaxed. He was still eloquently discussing the domestic and international situations with me. We had been acquainted for over a decade. Amidst the changing times, one realizes that people are only destined to come and go.</p>
<h3>The Poor Alleys of the Metropolis</h3>
<p>— Shui Mo</p>
<p>(I) "White Powder Offender"</p>
<p>Another "white powder" offender has died! The residents of the alley are used to seeing this. There is no sigh, no frown; every day, one or several corpses of vagrants addicted to white powder lie there, with sallow faces and bodies as thin as firewood… until the blue car carries the corpse away.</p>
<p>There is no need to ask about the source of the death. His background is enough to prove it. It is always the same encounter: the deceased had no job, usually curled up to sleep in the alley at night, and one day he fell ill. He could not beg, nor could he steal, so he could not get the "white powder" that was the source of his life. He could endure hunger, but he could not go a day without it. When the addiction kicked in, he struggled and convulsed once, and his life ended.</p>
<p>(II) Sunlight</p>
<p>Sunlight is scarce in the poor alleys.</p>
<p>These old, dilapidated buildings can still be considered apartments. Gray houses, narrow paths paved with cobblestones; the wooden frames supporting the houses are withered and rotten, the whitewash on the walls peeling off in heaps, the outlines of the houses noticeably tilted, looking old and about to collapse. The landlord does not repair it. The lives of the residents in the alley are as cheap as ants.</p>
<p>Inside a house, a room is divided into several small rooms like bean curd blocks using wooden boards. Even under the stairs becomes a room, as long as it can hold a bed. Every family is like this. One low building houses many families, some involved in loan sharking, some unemployed, some selling "white powder"...</p>
<p>The rows of houses are built very close together, and sunlight is precious.</p>
<p>Like a valley, or the bottom of a well, sunlight cannot penetrate. Until noon, when the sun is at its highest, which would be a good time to enjoy it, the people in the alley all like "practicality". Bamboo poles are crossed like a net, with clothes and diapers hanging...</p>
<p>The sunlight is blocked again, and only wisps of light like mist shine into this dark, secluded alley from the gaps.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon, Activities Lead to Marriage, Cultivating Jade and Conceiving Pearls Requires Skill</p>
<p>Jin Danyu originally wanted to take her group of sisters on a trip together. But after careful consideration: the He sisters would not be a problem. The longer they stayed in Shanghai, the better. Shao Huihua was also easy to discuss. She had just returned from Fujian and would not necessarily be sent elsewhere again, and she was interested in everything. Only Zhu Airen, a doctor and director in a hospital, was the question. Would she be willing to stay a few more days? And the Wu sisters, one a teacher and one a student, both had lessons every day. Could they ask for a day or two off? This would have to be discussed with them before a decision could be made. That day, Wu Junsu came, and the result of the discussion was, "The He sisters and Shao Huihua are no problem. Zhu Airen heard that she had come to Shanghai this time, and Dr. Zhang had asked her to do quite a few things, and she rarely comes to Shanghai anyway, so she can probably stay a few more days. However, my sister and I cannot stay in Shanghai any longer. Junke is graduating this year, and she has hopes of being sent to study in the United States. She has been working very hard lately, even studying on Sundays. After eating your wedding feast tomorrow, she will take the night train back that night. I originally had a class on Monday, but it is in the afternoon, so I plan to go back in the morning. But when we came, we were happily talking on the train, and the two He sisters wanted to visit the newspaper office where Shao Huihua works. Shao Huihua said: they would have to get permission from the office first before they could go together. She probably won't be free on Sunday, and plans to visit on Monday. And the appointment is on Monday evening, and Shao Huihua is even inviting us to dinner in the newspaper's big restaurant. I think: the newspaper industry is closely related to the literature department I teach in. History is the news of the past, and news is the history of the present. Students in our school are even required to visit newspaper offices. Therefore, when my younger sister Junke returns to school, I will ask her to take a day off on Monday and exchange my homework with a Teacher Zhou. Because he has exchanged with me before, but I must go back on Tuesday." Jin Danyu said, "Alright! Then Junke sister, I won't try to keep her for the sake of her studies. You must go back on Tuesday, and I won't force you to stay. But every week, from Saturday afternoon to Monday morning, you are free. Can't you accompany us to play during this time? I will definitely choose this time frame to travel, and I can even have a travel car pick you up in Suzhou." Wu Junsu smiled and said, "Why do you have to match my days? Don't you already have a lot of people?" (220)</p>
<h3>Letter from a Cotton Cloth Shop Apprentice: Please Pay Attention to Inferior Goods in Disguise</h3>
<p>After reading the report from a rice industry child, I truly admire his spirit. Now I will report my situation, hoping that you will correct and disclose it, and I will be very grateful.</p>
<p>I am an apprentice who has just left school life and entered a cotton cloth shop. Our shop deals in fancy goods, but specializes in converting inferior goods into domestic goods. The procedure is: first, bring in a truckload of inferior goods, and immediately open the boxes. This only starts after dinner. First, tear off the wrapping paper, then cut off the inferior goods trademarks and signs at the ends of the cloth, and then stamp on our own unregistered trademark, and wrap it in wrapping paper with our own sign. Finally, pack it in unused wooden boxes. After packing, we brush the sign and the number of domestic goods on the boxes. After the procedure is complete, we go to buy tax forms and transport them to the inland and overseas to deceive compatriots and overseas Chinese. Please pay attention to the Shanghainese and compatriots everywhere, and do not be fooled by unregistered trademarks, as there are many black curtain types of cotton cloth. For example, the method I saw in a certain shop is to put inferior goods into a dyeing vat and turn them into blue cloth. They also put on unregistered trademarks and fill everywhere, so I advise compatriots to pay attention.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Morality in Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Ke Yunlou Zhu</p>
<p>Peking opera is recognized as the national opera because it has a complete structure and is rich in historical plots. The simple and beautiful customs of our country in the past, and the stories and achievements of great men and extraordinary scholars, are brought to the stage, influencing people and benefiting them greatly. These are role models, the true spirit of drama. In my spare time, I often linger in theaters, washing away the dust of the world, and also seeking a small degree of mental and physical avoidance of evil. However, I occasionally see one or two scripts with frivolous plots and shallow language, which I deeply detest and disapprove of, because they give customers a bad impression and especially give children unhealthy thoughts, causing people grief beyond measure. Based on my past impressions, I have recorded the following, including (1) "The Talented Son-in-Law," (2) "The Drunken Concubine," (4) "Spinning Cotton," (5) "The Iron Bow Romance," (6) "The Mistake in the Flower Field"... and others such as "Capturing Zhang Sanlang Alive." Examining its plot, it also tends towards the supernatural and absurd, but it contains the meaning of karma, a startling warning, and its performance does not greatly offend and still has its merits, so it is not limited here. As this country is facing many difficulties and the environment is deteriorating, it is the time for us to strive for progress. Therefore, even if it is entertainment, we must not forget the sincerity of saving the country. Therefore, for the above-mentioned scripts that are overly exaggerated and harm the body and mind, theater owners should abandon them, which is also a way to fulfill the duties of a citizen.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Overseas Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Qiu Wen</p>
<p>The Chinese Theater built by the Chinese Association of New York and the Chinese Drama Association and other groups on Doyers Street in New York has been completely completed and is expected to open in February next year. It is also heard that old and new Chinese dramas will be performed in succession at the theater in the future, and most of the actors will be members of the Chinese Drama Association. When possible, various meaningful Chinese films will be shown to promote them.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple's new work "The Little Darling," another work after "The Little Orphan Goose," has been completely filmed. The script of the film is taken from several sections of a British mythology story script. Shirley plays a fairy, so her style in the film is obviously innovative.</p>
<p>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has decided to produce a full-color fairy tale historical film starring male and female child stars after "The Women." The script is based on the play "Peony Empress" by French writer Ms. Yagu Na. The company is now fully preparing for production and is expected to be completed before June 1940.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer's only surviving seven-year-old daughter, Manlei Ful, recently made a guest appearance as the adopted daughter of Pastor Tomali in her mother's film "Marie Antoinette." It is said that her performance was very good, so soon this future child star may be under the banner of Metro.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the Askote Theater in England successively screened two Chinese films, one was Lianhua Company's "The Great Road," and the other was Xinhua Company's "Diao Chan." Although these two films were only screened for five days at the theater, every show was sold out, which shows that the British people have a special interest in Chinese films. Recently, the theater's preview revealed that it will soon screen a Chinese film, which is "Wang Baochuan" produced by Yihua Company, directed by Wu Cun, and starring Zhang Cuihong and Li Ying. Because this script has been performed in London several times in the past, it has already won the praise of the British people, so this screening will undoubtedly cause a sensation among Chinese film fans in the city. It is also heard that when the film is screened, it will be accompanied by the screening of the Central Film Studio's recent Newsreel No. 16, "Victory in the Battle of Northern Hunan," which will give overseas Chinese in Britain an even more enthusiastic excitement.</p>
<h3>For the "Motherland"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Excited, I just watched "Regret for the Late Ming Dynasty," and then I saw "Motherland."</p>
<p>Both scripts tell us that under the oppression of aggressors, a heroic struggle for the motherland will inevitably be aroused! Starting from this theme, Sha Du arranged a moving story for "Motherland." In the six-act play, he controlled the audience's emotions with moving plots and suffocated the audience's breath with impassioned lines. Two years after the fall of Shanghai, "Motherland" is a sharp blade that pierces the depths of everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>Look: After Spain conquered Flandes, how cruelly the people of Flandes were sentenced to death: hanged with hemp ropes; when the hemp ropes ran out, they were filled in the stinky ditches; when the stinky ditches were full of corpses, large pits were dug to bury them. As for the women, they were handed over to the soldiers for free "disposal!"</p>
<p>Look: How Li Suer and Galuo jointly attacked with the volunteer army in coordination with Prince William's army. After the unfortunate failure, how the bell-ringing old man gave his life for the country.</p>
<p>Look: For the motherland, how Li Suer forgave Galuo's injustice and unfriendliness, and entrusted him with the important responsibility—loyalty. For the motherland, how Galuo killed his lover Dololai.</p>
<p>Looking at the firelight behind the stage, watching Galuo leave my sight with firm steps, I heard again</p>
<p>a familiar song:</p>
<p>"Life is precious,</p>
<p>Love is even higher in price,</p>
<p>But for freedom,</p>
<p>Both can be discarded!"</p>
<h3>Talking About Music in Bars</h3>
<p>— Han Ruo</p>
<p>In Shanghai, if you like to listen to music, you generally need to adopt the following methods to be able to hear it: (1) Turn on the radio to listen to broadcast music programs. (2) Wait for music concerts, such as the Landex Theater, the YMCA, etc., which occasionally have concerts. (3) Go to dance halls, and finally, you can only go to bars. The several ways to listen to music, except for bars, all have imperfections. First, not every family has a radio. Even if there is a radio, not every radio is very good and can receive clearly, and the programs you listen to always feel like there is a layer of space between them, making it uncomfortable to listen to. Secondly, concerts are very good, but they don't happen often. Thirdly, the music in dance halls, some of which is good, may not be unlistenable, but the environment feels a bit noisy, because listening to music in a quiet environment is always more suitable. So, all in all, to listen to music, it's still best to go to a good bar.</p>
<p>Most of the musicians in bars are of high caliber, because each bar's music team only has three or four people. Their keys and rhythms are very accurate, and they must be familiar with world-famous songs to be competent, otherwise they will not be able to perform in high-end bars. The composition of Shanghai bars is based on music, wine, and women, plus beautiful and artistic decorations, and perfect personnel management, so it becomes a place of leisure for Chinese and Western people. The music in the bars on the road is not bad. Knox, Pique-nique, etc., all have quiet music to listen to, especially the music in Knox, which can make music lovers linger. The singing and playing of the three musicians, Queerdo, Jack, and James, can be called the best. If you can name a song, they will be sure to play it for you.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from Outside the Peking Opera World</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Several Patrons in the Banking World</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the young master of a certain chairman in the Northeast also took a fancy to her. This person not only had power, but also a lot of money. Judging by his financial resources alone, he was not weaker than a certain banker. The two not only competed to support her, but also often brought a group of people to gamble in her residence. The money she earned each month from the gambling was considerable. However, the young master of a certain chairman was also a warrior with a rough temperament. Although they knew they were walking the same path, the certain banker always avoided him as much as possible. The certain Kun opera singer was also afraid of the warrior, so of course, whenever she received a call from the certain young master, she would often issue a soft eviction order, asking the certain banker to leave. So I said that the situation of this banker and that banker who supported Shu Yan was very similar. However, then again, the banker ultimately achieved the final victory. Shu Yan's personality was such that he couldn't get along with anyone for long, but he and his banker friend had never broken up for many years, and they are still very close now. According to rumors, all of Shu Yan's deposits are placed in that bank, with more favorable interest rates and extremely convenient withdrawals and deposits. Since the two have this kind of relationship, then of course they will not be separated. As for a certain Kun opera singer's friend, he has been unique in the past two or three years. It turned out that the certain young master had long left the old capital after the incident. He went to a strong enemy, and the joy in his heart can be imagined. (167)</p>
<h3>New Year's Eve Celebration Announcements</h3>
<p>YMCA: The Shanghai music community held an "Amateur Music Concert" at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge on the evening of the 22nd of last month. The performance was excellent and was praised by all sectors.</p>
<p>Because New Year's Day is approaching, various amateur groups want to take advantage of this festive season to prepare for a grand celebration and decorate the New Year. Among them, the "New Year's Eve Celebration" organized by the YMCA is the most exciting, divided into music, drama, and sports, each performing separately. However, there is one shortcoming, that is, admission is by ticket only, and non-members cannot enter.</p>
<p>Regarding music: (Starting at 3:00 PM on New Year's Day) There will be great programs such as brass music and string music led by Mr. Zhu Shalomen, and a male and female quartet chorus led by Mr. Zhao Tianxiu, solos, and a chorus of famous domestic musicians. At the same time, Mr. Zhao will sing famous Chinese songs in order to promote Chinese folk music, such as "Banqiao Daoging," "Hoe Song," "Chinese Saints," and "Mountains in the Vapid Void," etc., with piano and violin accompaniment and solos.</p>
<p>Regarding drama: (Starting at 7:00 PM on New Year's Day) There will be famous plays performed by the Central Youth Drama Society and famous drama troupes in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Regarding sports: There will be basketball performances by Hua Lian, Mai Ling, etc.</p>
<p>Chinese Staff Club: The Peking Opera Club of the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Staff Club has been established for ten years and has always been enthusiastic about social charity and has spared no effort. This time, in order to raise funds for the Shanghai Shenzhou Night School Adult Compulsory Education and the North China Flood Relief, it will hold three days of charity performances in a row at the Golden Theater in mid-January after Zhang Eyun finishes performing. It is reported that the plays are very exciting, and the famous martial arts ticket king Mr. Jin Kui will be the main attraction for three days. Mr. Zhu has stopped performing Peking Opera for several years. This time, after repeated invitations, and because it concerns charity, he agreed to show off his skills. With the club's talented people, it is expected that there will be a lively scene at that time. It is also heard that the initiator of this event is the Chinese Director of the Municipal Council.</p>
