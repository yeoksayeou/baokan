<h3>德國對英提出覆文　仍堅持對波土地要求　犧牲主觀非波蘭斷所能接受　但外交談判之門戶獪未閉塞</h3>
<p>（柏林）希特勒致英覆文、已於昨晚交漢德森、歐洲和戰問題將即可決定、德覆文於昨晚七時十五分在總理官邸由希特勒面交漢德森、希特勒與漢德森繼作二十五分鐘之談話、漢德森退出後、希特勒即延見義大使、外長里賓特洛甫亦在座、希特勒之覆文送出後、國社黨方面對時局抱相當樂觀、認希特勒願以和平方法、解決德波糾紛、但對於時局仍認爲極端嚴重、希特勒爲考慮對英覆文、前晚直至深夜始睡、睡僅數小時、後即將覆文內容述於錄音機中、由其女書記筆錄後、再由希氏加以修正、駐義德大使將於數日內返柏林述職、（三十日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）權威方面昨晚在此間宣布、希特勒總理與英國駐德大使星期一日談話、對於和平解決波德糾紛、並未發現任何鼓勵、希特勒總理重作德國對英友誼保證、然渠更堅決提出對波要求、某一負責外交當局聲稍、希特勒總理第一决正式要求上西里西亞·但澤。及波蘭走廊歸還德國、該項要求包括波蘭領土三分之一、（三十日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據今日此間可靠方面消息、希特勒對張伯倫覆文中、要求波蘭於二十四時之內、即派代表赴德接洽、其條件為波蘭允于談判之前將但波及波蘭走廊交與德國、其所限之時間為今晚半夜、據漢特森言、希特勒之覆文無異為哀的美頓書、（三十日美聯電）</p>
<p>（華沙）波蘭政界今日獲得希特勒要求波蘭於未開談判之前、先將但澤與走廊交出之消息、即稱、希特勒之要求、絕對不能接受、此項要求實屬蔑視波蘭之主權、(三十日美聯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）據消息靈通人士宜稱、此次德國對英復文、似較希特勒元首致法總理達拉第之函爲長、對於現行局勢、雖就各方面予以檢討、要之、各種可能性之途徑依然洞啟、特德波兩國直接談判、則無此可能耳云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）此問政界人士稱、現時進行談判之可能性依然存在、但德國對一般問題之態度、迄未改變、關於但澤市與走廊要求、不容再加討論、「柏林夜報」之言有謂、「但澤市與走廊業巳表示對德國效忠之意、此可於當地與情覘之、英法兩國對此種事實、不容假借其他理由、設法規避」、「漢堡地方日報」發表其社評曰、「英德兩國此决公文往還、交換意見、乃在探討現行危機之根源、基於英德合作重組世界和平之崇高理想、今巳爲英國在本年三月間改變其政治方針、採取反德態度所破壞、自彼時起、英國拒不承認欲建設新歐洲、非推翻凡爾賽和的不可之論據、於是希特勒元首企圖進行談判、糾正一九一九年錯誤之目的、未得置現、德國自戰後所受最大之創傷、厥爲但澤市與走廊、此項創傷、妨碍德國對調整和平之信念、必待創傷醫愈後、歐洲局勢始能現其光明前途」云、三十日海通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國飛機一架、頃於午前自柏林飛抵近郊赫斯敦飛行塲、所載乘客究係何人、無從探悉、航空部與德國大使館均謂毫無所知、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英政府致希特勒之復文、料將於今日發往柏林、關復文內容爲使希特勒不致不繼續致文英政府之性質者、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報稱、德關係之關鍵、在德國完全廢止其與各國交涉時所用之武力威脅方法、故德國與波蘭交涉之方法、爲德國是吾準備以可成立國際協定的手腕對他國進行交涉之試騐云、「每日電聞」稱、各國歡迎和平之熱烈、殆未有甚於英國者、但英國亦決不許希特勒逞其所欲於波蘭云、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）據德國新透訊社消息、希特勒偕外長里賓特羅甫昨晚六時一刻接見大使漢特森爵士、並授以希氏對於英政府牒文之答覆、衆料此項覆文將由英大使之秘書一人乘專機携往倫敦、聞希氏在完成此項答復之前、曾縝密考慮英相張伯倫在下院之演說云、據聞此項答復之內容、頗爲詳盡、昨晚交於漢氏者係德文原本、漢氏晋謁希特勒時、祗一人前往、希氏更對於復文內未列入之各點作口頭之說明、「愛森國民日報」曾著論評述此事、謂「元首對於各種合理之提議、仍隨時準備加以研究、並不斷努力以期達到必要之解決、此種態度實可爲世界仟何政治家之風範、惟英德外交談話之機續、並不能緩和局勢之緊張、必須俟德國之公正要求獲得滿足後、始能趨於緩和也云、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<h3>英閣會議縝密研究德覆文　唐寗街外交活動</h3>
<p>（倫敦）希特勒之覆文、昨日深夜送達英外部、首相張伯倫與外相哈立法克斯旋即研究之、歷時一小時半、今晨十時半舉行內閣會議加以討論、至十一時五十五分始散（卅日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨局勢中未有顯著發展、惟英內閣於午前十時半舉行重要會議、研究希特勒之覆文、首相張伯倫雖在深夜與外相哈立法克斯討論德方復文、商榷良久、然今晨九時半仍照常在聖詹姆士公園散步、而後返唐寗街十號、在內閣集會以前會接見閣員數人、法大使考賓午前曾至英外部、（卅日路透電</p>
<p>（倫敦）敦今晨英內閣集會、討論將希特勒復文轉告波蘭等國政府、及英國再行答復希特勒兩事、後於十一時五十五分散會、未定續開閣會日期、路透訪員探悉、殆因有商諸他國政府之必要、故未預定閣議日期、又探悉德國致英復文之內容、已於今晨電致駐華沙英大使甘納德轉達波蘭外長柏克、（卅日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）本日午前外務部當局極爲活動、法國大使考賓首先到部、相與進行談話、歷時四十分鐘、當即告以德國政府覆文內容、羅馬尼亞公使狄萊雅·荷蘭公使沃文·巴西大使眞利凡拉復相繼到部（卅日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間接近政府人士頃宣稱、英復德照會初達柏林時、反應頗爲不善、德國除要求收回但澤市與波瀾走廊之外、且會進一步有所要索、其時挽救和平之希望頗為薄弱、所望德國政府慈已幡然改圖、此外現有各種因素、例如（一）德蘇互不侵犯條約蘇聯取高議會延未批准、（二）法國前任陸軍參謀長魏剛將軍業已衛命前往近東、（三）日本與西班牙對於德國日益疏遠、（四）德國擬利用匃牙利、作爲進攻波蘭之根據地、似未為匈國所接受、凡此數端、均足使一般人心為之稍慰、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對症下藥　庶能立起沉疴　義相發表見解</h3>
<p>（羅馬）義大利人民報（墨相喉舌）今日聲稱、義相墨索里尼刻正專力以期覓取但澤問題之解決辦法、但覺僅此問題之解決、尚未能綏靖歐洲、依義相之見解、現所需者爲總解決、一切懸案皆宜整理云（卅日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）義大利人民報頃評論時局情形、略謂値此全世界危機四伏之際、世人均籲請墨索里尼首相出而挽救和平、但所謂和平未知究何所指、意者此非類似暫時止痛之劑、僅求敷衍了事、而不作沉疴再起之計、誠以歐洲種種病源、均自凡爾賽和的而來、倘無此的、一切病症均可霍然而愈、此則事理之顯見者也云、（卅日哈瓦電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）政府當局業已採取各種防空措置、燈火管制亦已實行、普動告人民退出羅馬與各大城市、所有私人汽車將於月三日起停止行駛、全國各飯店供給菜餚亦受有限制、一般人心頗為惶惶不安、僉以為時局情形極為危亟、政府行將有所重要决定、此在法西斯黨人士則謂、歐洲各國喝令已相繼封閉邊界、但談判仍在進行中、則現行危機未始無和平解決之望（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>犯杜阮井根未逞　日軍已退回江門　汀北華軍攻桃林獲勝　修河南岸日偽受挫折　長治城郊展開爭奪戰</h3>
<p>（肇慶）犯杜阮井根之日軍、經華軍奮勇迎擊、退回江門、又二十九晚日軍三百餘、再由江門進犯大井頭·棠下一帶、華守軍當予痛擊、現仍相持於篁村一帶、（三十電）</p>
<p>（翁源）東莞屬百石日軍百餘、二十九日晨進擾玉蘭、華方已派隊截擊（二十九電）</p>

<p>（樟樹）二十四晨、日偽百餘、由修河南岸楊洲以南之羅坪、向華方孫家埠一帶村落進擾、被華地方人民自組團隊奮勇抵抗、結果日僞被擊退、斃日僞軍數十人、現贛北淪陷地區人民紛紛自動武裝組織游擊隊、實行衛鄉抗戰、（三十日電）</p>
<p>（樟樹）日軍三百餘名、二十八日夜十一時、向高安正北赤由莊以西之沿陳家邊三次進犯、經華口部奮勇擊、激戰至二十九日拂曉、卒被華軍擊潰、並奪獲軍用品甚多、（二十九日電）</p>
<p>（洛陽）長治城之爭奪戰仍在劇烈進行中、自華四路圍攻迫近城郊、日軍恐慌萬狀、加緊戒備、刻在信義村（長子西南）東西之綫、趕築工事、企圖死守、至長子城內仍有日軍二千餘、砲十一門、城南大小堡頭、城西石坳鎭陽魯村一帶、尚有日警戒部隊七八名華某部正加緊掃蕩中、同時另部已由蓮城鎮（高平東北）附近向壺關（長治東）方面挺進、而日來大雨、長治附近公路又多被水冲毀、日軍之接濟益感困難、短期內不難被華軍圍而殲之也、（三十日電）</p>
<p>（洛陽）據前方歸來之某軍官司對記者談、晉東南戰事自華連克晉城高平等據點、日軍望風披靡、死傷甚眾、連是運往侯馬之傷兵已達三千餘、其一部正向臨汾轉運、中途遇有傷重不治者、則縱火焚燒、其狀至慘、（三十日電）</p>

<h3>日犯缽盂山　傷亡慘重</h3>
<p>（新喻）近據日方宣稱、自十日起、由灘溪向華靖安以北缽盂山進犯之日軍、共有步砲一千七百餘人、騎兵四百餘人、十一日在缽盂山附近戰死九十三人、傷者一百二十三人、至十八日、先後傷二百三十餘人、現正撤退後方整理中、由此可見當時戰鬥之激烈、日方死傷慘重之一斑、（三十日電）</p>

<h3>英國手裏的和平</h3>
<p>據日昨電訉，歐洲的緊張局勢，業已造峯登極。德波邊境的糾紛，不斷發生；各國備戰的動員，幾及全部；呼籲和平的反應，微弱之至。目前僅祗有英德兩國間公文的往返，被認爲尚未完全閉塞的和平之門。</p>
<p>在二十五年之前，第一次歐洲大戰發生的前夕，法總統普恩賚要求英國切實表示助法，曾說和平握在英國的手裏；誰知在第一次歐洲大戰一觸即發的今日，和平又是握在英國的手裏。這次德波糾紛的主題，是德國要求歸併但澤和波蘭走廊；而英國對於波蘭，則先有援助反抗侵略的諾、言，五日前又簽訂了反抗侵略的軍事盟的；因此關係，德國要求的目標雖屬波蘭，而德國交涉的對手却是英國。最近英德二國交涉的公文，現在未經公開發表，我們雖可以推想其間主要項目總不外但澤和波蘭走廊問題，但德國方面近頃再三表示的，德國對此兩個問題，原則上已不容再加討論；然則兩國不憚煩勞，公文往復，究竟討論些什麼？若不是已經牽涉到了相常廣的範圍；便是討論到了比原則更細的項目了！</p>
<p>英法人士多以爲這次的英德交涉·決不會成爲慕尼黑第二；實際上這次的交涉，能否跳出張伯倫綏靖政策的舊路。終還是問題。若以目前德國對波蘭的堅決態度而言，英國除了强迫波蘭滿足德國的要求，以換取和平之外；唯一的辦法，祇有和波蘭爲防止侵略而共同作戰。那麼德人所認爲握在英國手中的和平，當然爲之粉碎無遺，但這類和平是吾値得珍惜，也還是問題。我們所理想的，國際當前所爭取的和平，殊有異於德國心目中的和平；而應該是眞正的全世界光榮的和平，若使不能爭取全世界光榮的和平，不但「慕尼黑」式的和平後果，前車可鑒，即以目前而論，波蘭亦未必能聽從英國的勸導，肯爲不光榮的和平而犧牲。因此種種，和平與吾的關鍵，固然在英國手裏；即和平本質與價値的決定，也在英國手裏！現在的英國，應放棄秘密談判的方針，顯明的表出嚴正的態度，拒絕不公平的要求，才是英國所握着的和平！國際演變所予人類的敎訓已多，我們相信英國人對於手裏所握的和平，必能以最道德最明哲最荘嚴的態度來運用吧？</p>
<p>一國有一國的國策，英德自然不能有所例外：國策是固定的，可是國策的實行，虛虛實實，各自有其不同的手段。目前歐局的劍拔弩張，不能不認爲是緊張危險；但是一定要說牠將成爲歐洲第二次大戰，這點誰也不能斷定。據日昨莫斯科電訉，傳說德外長曾向史丹林提供保證，德國雖作戰事準備，然最後，仍當接受以和平解決德波糾紛的方案，這可見德國也不一定有作戰的決心。何况歐洲第一次大戰的創痕尚在，德國又豈願把二十餘年的新建設，再毀之於一旦，惟其如此，我們也不願以破壞和平的責任，遽爾確定爲德國罪行的鐵案。尤如各種糾紛爭議的解決，亦必覓致公道的新標準，以求其平允而能持久。若使英國方面更能不以盟國友邦的一造自居，而自視爲公道的護法，則所握的和平必能更見其可貴。</p>
<h3>波蘭政府　宣布總動員令　德軍進駐斯洛伐克　但澤行按口給糧制</h3>
<p>華沙　波蘭政府今日下午宣布總動員令、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>華沙　聞此間與但澤之電話交通、現已中止、並聞但澤人民現受按口給糧之制度、與德國境內之德人同、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　此間接但澤消息、自昨日起、已有按期駛但澤之火車若干輛未駛抵、據傳乃在邊界爲波蘭人所阻、但澤政府已向華沙提出嚴重抗議、（三十日路透電）</p>

<h3>日各報無好評</h3>
<p>（東京）　日本報紙對於新首相阿部信行所組內閣、不甚加以好評、朝日新聞指新內閣「平凡而缺活潑、」因首相向與政治絕無關係、而與軍界亦無接觸、蓋已退休三載矣所可認爲傑出人選者、厥爲新任海相吉田善吾一人、至於新任陸相畑俊六、前任華中日軍總司令者、並不代表軍界進步份子、據謂、新內閣大有官僚政治性質、民政黨員永井柳太郞爲唯一的政黨中人、民政黨主席極不以其試任遞信大臣爲然、日本各報贊成首相廢止內閣制度之决定、此種制度在近衛與平沼內閣中、似曾引起五相及其他閣員之摩擦同時、各報鑒於「中國事件」發生後、各行政省所採經濟及其他計劃、事務巳極繁重、深恐閣員兼職、將引起嚴重困難、聞外交方面對於首相兼任外相、　覺不滿、因此時日本外交關係、甚屬微妙、而又異常重要也、伍堂卓雄之任商相、或能勝任愉快、惟兼任農相、是吾適宜亦成問題尤以食物與物價高漲問題刻正緊急之時爲然、蓋商省與農省對於此事、見解常易相反也、報紙預料、藏相遵循其前任者之政策、中外商業新聞評論新內閣、謂其政策如何、現尚未可知、今加强反共軸心之方案、旣已廢止、而迫令日本重定對歐外交、故新內閣在外交政策上、應自完全新的角度、另砌爐灶、依旗賴外國之主張、不可贊成、兼任外相之首相、宜與同情諒解日本使命、「即建立東亞新秩序」之外國、而願對日合作者、互相合作云、國民新聞對於前任內閣閣員、不復供職於新內閣一事、表示滿意、但對於新內閣所遵行之政策、尤其爲外交政策、表示關切、該報述及駐英大使重光葵將任外相之傳說、謂日本外交目的、須在擊破英國在東亞之支配而建立東亞新秩序、此種指導的原則、决應不受德蘇締結互不侵犯條的所引起的國際新局勢之影響云、該報對於歐美所傳英日重親之可能性、頗爲關切、謂新內閣若竟對英妥協、而阻碍東亞新秩序之建立、則屬國家之不幸、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據今日此間消息、日本阿部內閣、在政治方面之力量似乎並無問題、要點還在其對於戰時經濟財政方案、能吾順利推行耳、就阿部內閣之人選而觀、雖不能謂爲强有力之內閣、但內部亦不致有重大之磨擦在經濟方面、大約不致有何更張、換言之、仍須依照原定之原則、集中力量、以謀戰事之延續、財閥方面對於靑木一男出任藏相一節、極爲歡迎、以其理財政策有類於前藏相賀屋與石渡也、聞新大藏省之重要問題、爲新賦稅計劃之推行、（三十日美聯電）</p>
<h3>國際輿論一斑</h3>
<p>（紐約）　紐約「太陽」報今日刊載社論云、「日本新內閣、在獲得英美信任以前必將處於孤立地位、」並謂日本新內閣必將遭遇重大困難、蓋首相阿部大將乃以非政治態度而擔任重要政治職責者也、且德元首希特勒旣以簽訂蘇德公的而出賣日本、則日本所受之打擊、「决非任何內閣所能設法補償、（三十日美聯電）</p>
<p>（重慶）　關於日本內閣之改組、此間各報、咸加以長篇評論、一致認爲日本外交、已到達窮途末路、內閣之變邊、並不足以挽回絕境、「中央日報」稱、平沼內閣之倒閣、巳屬無可避免、因其組閣之初、即公開以增强反共公約爲目的、今德蘇締約、則內閣焉得不倒、日本此種悲劇之演成、乃因缺乏有遠識政治家之故、「大公報」力言阿部大將拉攏英國之企圖勢必失敗、蓋日本一日欲在東亞建立新秩序、則英美權益一日將被摧毀、九國公約、亦一日將被破壞也、英文「楚報」稱、歐洲危機之第一個犧牲者竟在亞洲發現、亦殊可異、蓋歐洲局勢之演變、逼迫日本內閣之辭職、該報指陳自中日戰審開始以來、已經有三個短壽之日本內閣、先後遭遇政策之失敗、此决阿部信行大將拜命組閣、如不對於中國衝突有根本解決之方案、則其失敗、亦可計日而待、（三十日海通電）</p>
<p>（香港）　日閣總辭職事港各中文報均加以評論、僉認平沼內閣崩潰乃直接受蘇德不侵約之影響、將來新閣必力謀親英、以彌補反共軸心脫輻之損失、而圖由此自拔於侵華戰爭之泥淖、於結論中大公報謂國際上任何大變動、且不能影響華對日抗戰、日閣更迭自然更不足重視、不管何人登台、日本一日不放棄侵略、中國總是抗戰到底、而日本若不知悔悟、即更換百次內閣、亦脫不了深陷的泥足、（二十九日電）</p>
<h3>美國務鄉關懷　遠東時局　延見雅納爾等</h3>

<h3>英國有備無患　決心抵抗暴力　張伯倫之堅强表示　獲各黨派一致擁護</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　今日下院復有團結一致之莊嚴表示、工黨自由黨反對派領袖聆首相張伯倫演說後、均發言贊助政府在目前危機中所取之堅決立塲、工黨副領袖格林武曰、「余願以至切實之言詞、設明侵略今必須終止、（衆歡呼）波蘭決不隨爲侵略者之犧牲物之諸國而入墳墓、吾人之精神並未减弱、且見增高、吾人希望並祈禱、能避免大破壞、假使不能者、則其責仟將由一人負之、苟非希特勒願意戰爭、，則戰爭自不致發生、工黨決計保衛自由、並維持法紀、以抗專橫施用武力者、吾人之決心、一言以蔽之、即公然侵略之威脅應有以終止之、吾人對此一事、果敢而不可搖動、凡不尊重一再贊同而發之質言者、將爲對世界之和平與自由之叛徒」云、</p>
<p>自由黨領袖辛克來機起發言曰、「吾人不能由「危機而人另一危機、此節必須制之、此際政府應獲國會與不列顚所有寳愛和平的人民之堅固贊助、今最後一言將由希特勒發之」云、外相哈立法克斯勳爵曾在上院演說、其詞與首相張伯倫在下院所發者大旨相同、於是國會遂延會至下星期二日、</p>
<p>首相張伯倫今日在下院所發之演說、其語鎭靜而堅决、且足使人興奮、首相在熱烈歡呼聲中發言曰、「世人常謂英人之决定意志、輒覺遲緩、然英人之意志一經决定、決不使之稍縱、今和戰仍在未定之天、吾人對堅守所巳定的方針之决心、决不有絲毫懈怠、」首相繼稱譛英國全體人民在此期待時期中所表示之非常鎭靜態度、首相次述及國防之準備、謂渠承認關於微發之各計畫、將引起種種不便、惟渠信人民今必一致承認國家之需要、今已爲高於一切矣、第吾人今尚未開始在此發給口糧也、英國之空防今已置於立即行事之狀態中、陸地防空佈置已派兵防守、王家空軍常備隊增加必耍之後備人員後、已臻戰時之實力、阻塞汽球隊已各派定防地、偵察團已駐於其防所、警報制已準備日夜動作、（衆歡呼）海灣防務已佈置完備、重要各地點均駐軍防守、海軍在此次危機發生時已早有凖備、戰艦隊之全部凖備一接命令、即作戰時之佈陣、（衆歡呼）國內與海外均有大批軍隊之調動、此項調動乃預先籌定計畫之一部分、故各隊伍應儘速於戰事發作前開至各防所、地方常局一接通知、即能將人烟稠密各地之學童·有嬰兒之母、有孕之母·與盲人、移往安全地點、傷兵醫院亦在籌設之中、凡此種種、均足表示國家之有備無虞也、（衆歡呼）首相之演說歷時十六分之久、（二十九日路邊社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　英政府答復德國之照會、以及歐洲方面最近各項消息、頃由接近白宮與國務院人士縝密加以研究、僉認英法政府必能保持鎭靜而又堅決的態度、美國各報所載英國擬向德國有所讓步、不惜任何代價保持和平之說、殆係受德國宣傳運動之影饗、實非眞相、要之、現行局勢業由英首相張伯倫在該國下院所發表之演設明白表出、換言之、和戰關鍵完全以德國對英復文如何以爲斷、希特勒元首或可應允賡續進行談話、但此非放棄原定任何目標之謂、以意度之、元首殆欲延長「神經戰爭」之期限、故現行危機、一時靴望澈底解決、德國或謀成立暫時的折衷方案、以待適宜時機再行採取「攻勢」、實則英法兩國必不任其如願以償、此外、德蘇兩國互不侵犯條約批准案、蘇聯最高議會延未討論、該的成立時所引起之影饗已歸幻滅、是亦頗可重視、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法國力謀自衛　戒備加嚴　禁止公開集會　外僑紛紛投軍</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　法國「藍卡」級之後備兵業已應微入伍、俟「紅卡」級壯丁入伍之後、全國總動員即開始實現、法總理達拉第、昨與國防總參謀長甘茂林將軍、詳談軍事防衛事宜、達拉第旋即延見前總理勃魯姆、當由勃魯姆表示社會黨黨員、一致擁護政府之意、按該黨自與共產主義者分離之後、其實力已較前大增、據警務當局宣稱、巴黎近郊之共黨機關及印刷所一百五十處、曾經嚴密搜查、結果抄獲標語三千張、宣傳小冊九萬本、父據政府當局宣稱、此後一切政治集曾、均在嚴禁之列、此間官塲人士認爲政府之舉動、乃係法國對西班牙邦交日趨敦睦之結果、又今日官方對電報電話之檢查、業已稍見鬆弛、但檢查工作仍在進行中、（三十日美聯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　政府頃發表命令城區及近郊各處均不得舉行公開集會、各酒肆與咖啡店內倘有人違禁開會、卽當予以封閉、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>蘇聯沉機關變　增强西陲防務　德蘇公約延不批准　促進和平有力因素</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　近來外國報紙多家、例如瑞士「新朱利希報」、疊載消息稱、蘇聯軍部業從西部國境撇退軍隊二三十萬、調往東部國境增防、塔斯社前奉命聲明上項消息與事實全不相符、據關係方而聲稱、蘇聯軍部因東歐形勢嚴重、一切意外事件均有發生可能、且已决定增加西疆防軍兵力、（二十九日塔斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　共產黨機關報眞理報頃發表一文、評論國際時局、路謂蘇聯深知戰爭威脅、異常嚴車、是以忙於充實紅軍實力、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　此間今日消息、蘇聯正向德國施用壓力、促德國加入和平解决波德危機談判、蘇聯方面視蘇聯議會延不批准蘇德互不侵犯公的、乃向德國威脅、倘德國攻擊波蘭、公的即將被撕、此間蘇聯方面聲稱、倘德國在最近時期侵略波蘭、將予蘇聯最高蘇維埃會議、以反對批准德蘇互不侵犯公約機會、該項公的因楚消滅、此問視莫斯科宜布蘇聯增强西疆戍兵、乃向德國施用另一壓力、反對侵略、並保陣波蘭及巴爾幹牛島各國、（三十日美聯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　此間官塲接獲蘇聯最高會議對於蘇德互不侵犯協定將緩期批准及其他消息後、皆希望蘇聯對於限制侵略上、仍將有所貢獻、當此項恊定簽訂之時、蘇美兩國之關係雖會受極端之震動、但目下各官方之意、皆以爲實際情形並不如所想像之惡劣、美國各報之反蘇運動、均不免發動過早云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　最高議會昨日開會後、迄未將德蘇互助條的批准案提付討論、此間外國人士以爲、、蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫原定於此項條的批准之日、在議會中發表演說、說明蘇聯外交政策、茲本案延緩討論、可見政府之意、乃欲靜觀國際時局之發展、質言之、最高議會之延緩討論批准案、實爲蘇聯政府所願望、而决非出於偶然者也、查最高議會開會以來、業於本日將農業稅法案一致通過、明日爲蘇聯假日、當停會一天、卅一日午後一時復會時、當將新兵役法案提出討論、假定此項法案能於常日表决通過、則德蘇互不侵犯條的批准案、至少亦須俟至下月一日、始可加以討論、抑此次政府召集最高議會開會、事出倉猝、多數議員之來自外省者、多不及於昨日如期趕釗、因此最高議會昨日討論農業稅法案時、議塲之中、空席甚多、頗見寥落也、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>神經戰爭　入新階段</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　此間消息靈通人士頃宣稱、歐洲國際現行「神經戰爭」、似將於本日進入新階段、截至目下爲止、德國所提各項要求既無讓步之跡象、亦未允先與波蘭國進行談判、以冀貫澈其要求、雖德國各報論調稍趨和緩、各關係國在外交上多所努力、均可視爲良好朕兆、但德國軍隊業巳集中於斯洛伐克邦、共地距但澤市甚遠、可見但澤、在事實上業已威脅於波國上西萊集省、此外、喀爾巴阡烏克蘭省、（前屬捷克現歸匈國所有）烏克蘭民族主義之多數黨員、聞携有德國護照、返歸該省、宣傳大烏克蘭運動、（波國境內有烏克蘭人甚衆、）凡此種種、實可證明時局情形、仍極渾沌也、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>徐家滙天主堂　安神父被謀斃　下午五時發覺業已氣絕　案情離奇法當局殊重視</h3>
<p>昨日滬西徐家匯土山灣天主敎堂內、忽然發生離奇謀殺案、而被害者即係該敎堂之主持人安神父、詳情探錄於後、</p>
<p>神父略歴</p>
<p>法國人安神父、年逾六旬、來華傳敎有年、爲人耿直、忠誠·勤愼·敦厚、一生尤致力於慈善事業、故深得滬上人士之崇仰、一度任職於震旦大學、嗣即專門致力於土山灣天主敎堂所創辦之孤兒院工藝廠任院長、迄今已歷十二年之久、</p>
<p>未見下樓</p>
<p>該孤兒院工藝廠、經安氏之慘澹經營、刻下已有工人七百餘人、安氏即住宿於該廠隔壁敎堂之南樓一房間內、昨日上午九時左右、尚有人目擊安氏下樓巡視、惟中飯即未見安氏下樓用膳、當時亦未有人加以注意、蓋因安氏有時亦不下樓午餐也、</p>
<p>氣絕多時</p>
<p>迨至下午五時許、有一孤兒工人至樓上向安氏報告要事、詛甫推開房門、祗見安氏兩手被縛、被人謀斃於房內地板上、該工人駭極而呼、經人聞聲趕到、奈安氏已氣絕多時、撫之已冰、乃急報告捕房、捕頭立率中西包探趕往詳加查勘、</p>
<p>官員視察</p>
<p>同時法國駐滬海陸軍長及大使館公董局各高級人員聞耗、均親自前往視察、可見安氏平日爲人崇敬之一斑、現屍身仍暫留置於本人所居之房間內、候法當局檢騐後、再爲棺殮</p>
<p>推測原因</p>
<p>至安民遇害之原因、據一般人之臆測、謂安氏所主持之孤兒院工藝廠、定於每月底發給薪工總數的四千餘兀、今日爲發薪之期、兇手料定安氏早已將該項工款預備齊全、故特早一日下此毒手、惟工款是吾被刦、現捕房絕對保守秘密、一面加緊緝兇、務獲解究、</p>

<h3>江問漁論　大時代中的小學敎師（二）</h3>
<p>期待小學敎師有特殊做法</p>
<p>物質精神應有合理待遇</p>
<p>倡議辦法八條切望實行</p>
<p>先說怎樣期待的問題、我們所期待於小學敎師的、固然、要他能循規蹈矩去辦小學、要他能在小學校內好好的去敎兒童、能遵守法規、能講解明晰、能訓育得宜、但是、在此大時代中，期望他所負的使命、我以為還不止此、在後方所謂游擊區內的小學敎師、要能運用特殊敎育方法、收穫特殊敎育效果、那是不用說了、就是在後方的所有小學敎師、也不能僅僅以敎育學校兒童、就算盡了他的責任啊、如協同政治工作人員、發動民衆啦、如帮助地方民衆、進行自治自衛的組織啦、如配合游擊隊擔任種種與軍事有關的工作啦、如推進婦除文盲工作、除敎育兒童外、兼去敎育成人啦、如設法增進地方民衆健康先、從本校兒童保護工作做起、逐漸推及於一般的民衆啦、凡此種種、可以說、皆是從前小學敎師不必擔任、亦無須擔任的、查是此刻却不能不兼任起來了、目前事實上的需要、固然是這樣、將來戰事結束以後、凡是被摧殘破壞的地方、敎育如何復興、此時也不能不預為想到、且不能不預為準備、校舍燬掉了、校具蕩然無存了、我們要恢復學校、怎樣去辦、若等縣政府把建築費設備費一一籌好、或者待公家把房屋一一蓋好、校具一一購好、再讓小學敎師從從容容去上課、我想恐怕是不容易的吧、不要說殘破之餘、一切建設、在在需款、款是不能多籌的、就是籌出來了、也不能專用在敎育一方面、（當然安撫流亡一事是最為重要、那末、敎育如何復興呢、依我說此時小學敎師、便應該另有一套特殊本領、特殊做法、來應付着這和種特殊需要、校舍沒有、不要緊、可由敎師去聯合附近農民、七手八腳、共同來建築、簡單茅屋、所費無多、尅期組成、倉卒可辦、桌子、凳子、黑板、乃至應用的一切校具、沒有也不要緊、或則自行製造、或則聯合農民、說明道理、讓來校兒童、依照從前私塾辦法、各帶小桌小凳到校、至於自然學科敎授時所用的簡單儀器標本、社會學科敎授時所用的簡明圖書表解、不論好醜、只論有無、也可由敎師自行製造、同時在農村的小學、要附設小工藝廠、由敎師率領學生種植畜養、並作簡易的手工製造、這樣一來、不但收復的各地小學敎育、能容易復興、且可特別發展、就是原來在後方的各小學、也可把作風改變一下、另顯出一種新氣象來了、</p>

<h3>金融　英美滙兌回漲甚勁　本市美匯更為松動　華商轉賣益切　掉期已見扎攏</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗市、因英美滙兌受蘇俄暫緩批准與德國所訂互不侵犯條約之鼓勵、致回漲甚勁、計長一角一分及一角〇二厘半、而歐局消息亦巳不若上數日之惡化、故本市暗盤晨開現英平美鬆之反象、計英金仍爲三便士九三七五、美匯則硬至七元一八七五、嗣後因德蘇言好後、日本亟欲拉攏英美、因此市上遂有遠東和平空氣之傳來、以是一般老多頭如華行及投機商等、旣皆獲利倍蓗、當今時局或將轉變之際、互相乘機出籠、兼香港亦來電塞、故美滙市勢、獨趨鬆賤、一度銀行吃進曾硬達七元四三七五、惟英金因滙豐對於四便士儘量吃進、致鬆勢又被阻撓、價遂站定於四便士關口、延至午收結果、英金僅鬆〇四六八七五、美滙則猛長三二五、至期貨因有九月份起小准掉期套利傳說、故九月期華商賣意益切、鬆勢較現貨允厲、終則以英金三便士七八一二五、美匯六元八七五收盤、是以掉期遂見軋攏、英金祇距離二〇三一二五、美匯僅相差四三七五、約合月息（除佣）六分三厘、而實際上套利者、尚難獲得、半天交易尚旺、</p>
<p>英金穩定四便士關</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均升三七五、紐約銀價放長八七五、倫敦生金回縮四先令、滙兌英對美回長一角一分、對滬大一二五、對法漲二十五生丁、美對英回升一角〇二厘半、對滬小七角五分、對法跌四分二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士九三七五、美匯七元一八七五、較上日、英平美鬆一八七五、乃因匯兌猛烈回漲之故、開後外行賣意頗濃、而吃胃不佳、允其對於美滙，計有利與某美行相繼塞予日銀行及洋行現貨美匯七元一八七五及二五、繼而華銀行與投機商等吐予滙豐現貨英金四便士、是以過程帶硬、迨滙豐掛脾揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、計徵百分之二·二五、此後因市上有遠東和平空氣傳說、致一般多戶競相脫售、但英金因匯豐四便士有無限納胃、故站定無變、然美金因外行匯兌看長、是以吃胃極淡、故獨趨鬆賤、計華行及投機家又相繼塞予匯豐現貨英金四便士、並又吐予外行現貨美滙由七元三一二五、長至四三七五、繼華商又賣予外行九月份美滙由六元六二五、硬至九三七五、將近午刻、港電吐予匯豐等外行現貨英金四便士、及現貨美滙七元三七五、時聞稍有掉期買賣、計英行有利貼進同行美金五三一二五、的合月息（除佣）七分八厘光景、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三便士九八四三七五、美滙七元三一二五、九月份英金三便士七八一二五、美匯六元八七五、結果較上日、現貨英長〇四六八七五、美硬三一二五、九月份英賤一二五、美鬆半元、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>香港美滙同見猛鬆</p>
<p>香港三十日電、今晨匯市開盤無電到申、十時三十分行情堅穩、英滙現貨不動、仍爲一先令二便士九六八七五、美匯現貨猛鬆八七五、爲二十七元六二五、十一時〇五分平穩、英滙現貨回緊〇三一二五、爲一先令三便士九三七五、美滙現貨回縮一二五、爲二十七元半、申匯不動、仍爲三百七十元、日滙不詳、</p>
<p>外幣跌多漲少</p>
<p>昨日外幣、因外匯脚地鬆動、烚赤虛弱、盤旋於四千元關口、故大勢軟弱、英美金鎊需要稀少而降、英美金票人心暗淡、復向下游、法郎票亦虛弱微小、香港·新加坡·荷蘭·羅比等票因與時局無涉、俱轉堅昂、坎拿大票斐律濱票、跟美匯鬆動而下、暹邏票需要稀少、市况疲弱、日金票穩定、晚市爲一元一角六分五厘、朝鮮票仍爲一元零五分、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱降一元、英金票降二角、美金票降四角、香港票升二分、法郎票降五厘、新加坡•荷蘭·羅比票俱升二角、坎拿大·斐律濱·暹邏票俱降二角、其其他各幣未更、</p>
<p>英美銀價回長</p>
<p>二十九日倫教電、大條銀市近遠期均復回長三七五、乃投機家買進、供給有限、市况牛定、收市後買戶知足、五金市塲來售出、照掛牌低〇六二五有買戶、又紐的電、美銀價現貨亦放長八七五、爲三角七分、又孟貿電、印銀現期貨均未更、未有成交云、</p>
<p>貼現復升二元半</p>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、略見回高、每千元上午始終仍爲一百七十七元五角、下午略見升至一百八十元、比上日復升二元半、錢業公會拆息早午兩市仍掛一角八分云、</p>
<h3>現金賣風轉盛</h3>
<p>現金烚赤暗盤、昨日趨勢仍屬飄忽不定、時上時下、殊難捉摸、大宗心理、固有不利多方之消息、復趨虛弱、大致先盤旋·繼傾跌·而後稍回、初開因英純金猛烈回挫、兼外匯報硬、致晨開即退達四千；〇七十元、嗣因某錢兌業尚有吃胃、一度會拉抬至四千一百十元高峯、不久塲中突有和平空氣之傳說、且外滙美金猛長、故一般散戶膽怯者、頓來出籠、同時銀樓帮亦頻來塞出、加以港帮採辦停頓、致市價傾瀉至四千〇二十元、午刻則稍回高、爲四千〇四十元收盤、午後開市更缺乏維持、竟猛撳至三千九百七十元低盤、入後因錢兌業與某銀號及金號等稍來吸收、遂又回高至四千〇二十元收盤、結果較上日回跌八十五元、全天交易約千兩光景、銀樓飾金步挫十元、海關金與中英純金等猛烈回跌、</p>
<p>一度又進四千元關</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開因外匯報長、致售者頗多、開市即做小三十五元、銀樓帮賣予某金號二十兩、價爲四千〇七十元、嗣因某錢兌業頻代客吸收、且賣者不湧、價遂漸漸抬高、不久回出四千一百元關外、錢兌業互做三十兩、價四千一百十元、爲當日高峯、此後因某金號忽轉賣風、價遂下挫、不久即撳小三十五元、某金號吐予同業五十兩、價爲四千〇七十五元、後另一錢兌業力吸百餘兩、價遂一度又抬高至四千一百元關口、其時塲中突傳遠東有和平消息加以外匯美金頗鬆、致趨勢重轉向下、錢兌業及證券帮與銀樓帮等爭先力塞、且客帮與散戶均懷觀望、未幾價竟傾瀉八十元、錢兌業賣予銀樓帮二十兩、價爲四千〇二十元、將近午刻、散戶獲利復進、遂稍轉穩、金號進錢兌業十兩、爲四千〇四十元、昨午收價、午後因錢兌業賣意頗濃、且一時進者觀望、價竟猛撳七十元、錢兌業售予金號三十兩、價爲三千九百七十元、後散戶趁低吸收、價遂逐漸回高、未幾即漲起五十元、錢兌業互做二十兩、價爲四千〇二十元、不久又降落十五元、證券帮塞予金號二十兩、價爲四千〇〇五元、入後某銀號稍來吸收、重略抬高、某銀號進錢兌業三十兩、爲四千〇二十元、昨晚收價、現金號之本牌金售出價、較烚赤高十元、現標金照掛牌金低六十五元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十五元、迨至十二時十八分、掛小五元、下午二時十分、又掛低五元、計大同行改懸四百〇五元、新同行爲四百〇三元、收進約减二十元光景、</p>
<p>英鎊轉堅純金猛落</p>
<p>二十九日倫敦電、英純金回跌甚勁、蓋聞蘇德不侵犯條的展期批准之消息、是以英鎊轉堅、多戶獲利猛塞致每盎斯回挫四先令、計退達七鎊十七先令、故中央銀行之中國現金收買價、亦回小至一千二百八十一元四角、掛牌海關金亦掛小六分九厘、計二元五角三分二厘、上海標準標金價亦隨跌三十二元五角、計降達一千二百七十六元七角、</p>
<h3>證券　內債多頭　與趣濃厚</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、波瀾漸起、據面似亦稍稍擴張、買賣雙方、亦均比較活躍、人心因此亦大都向上、因市價上落甚鉅、天氣亦已凉爽、故臨時動議、改做全日交易、塲上因和平空氣又起、有謂英美將受託出而調停、因此市價上午平穩、午後忽起漲風、交易亦漸見湧旺、素於公債市塲負有盛名之某大戶、亦出其餘力買進、金子帮亦漸感興趣、賣方大都爲多頭獲利了結、並有賣後再行復進者、午前以鼎康聯益永康鴻康等買進、午後爲同康德孚及二十五號進胃爲强、賣方午前爲散戶了結、午後爲潤利多頭出籠、趨勢以多方氣勢爲盛、故全日結果、除丁種午後因未做開、獨小一角、餘則一律上漲一元　一元二角、成交總數、全日的有一百五十萬元之譜、茲例簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商證券交易所股五十股、價爲二十四元五角、</p>
<p>又上海衆業公所報告云、昨日股市人心一般較現愉快、此顯係與倫敦及紐的各主要市塲昨晚之漲勢相呼應、雖交易範圍不大、然價格上漲、甚形普遍、於以見多方了結者、並不願操切從事也、後此一二日當係歐洲爭論之决定階段、果戰事能避免、吾人逆料市况當有長足之進步、良以此際本埠局勢、已由緊張而告鬆弛、而在華之列强關係、又有改善可能、此種趨勢、殆有不得不然者、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠柬各公司股票、本月二十九日（週三掛牌行市、略見好起、開平煤礦不記名股上升九便士、爲十三先令三便士、古拉客林傍橡皮股回升七便士半、爲十六先令三便士、其餘均無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債、本月二十九日（週二）掛牌行市、市氣呆滯、行盤有行無市、上檔之掛牌稍見提升、英德續（英發）升四鎊、爲四十五鎊、中法美金升六鎊、爲三十八鎊、英法（英發）及善後（英發）各升三鎊、煎者爲四十三鎊、後者爲二十八鎊、克利斯浦續升一鎊半、爲二十鎊、費克斯飛樣借款升一鎊、爲十鎊、下檔鐵路公債變動甚微、隴海路借款升三鎊、爲十二鎊、湖廣路非德發降一鎊、爲十二鎊、其餘仍告平定、</p>
<h3>雜糧　揚州新蔴上市　價開二十五元</h3>
<p>雜糧新貨、前昨兩日又有白芝蔴上市、計到揚州貨七十餘包、今庚江北一帶、年成雖無十足可收、但亦非可謂歉收、出品尚可、惟籽粒稍瘦、泥灰見重、行情前昨兩日均開二十五元、由本街分去、市况尚屬平穩、聞後批一時仍少大帮運來、其他黃豆潛勢在高堅决軟之局　蠶豆形轉辱勢、昨日因風驟雨急、以致市塲中交易寥寥、計共做開黃豆五百九十包、蠶豆六百餘包、及苞米三百包而已、</p>
<h3>糧食　客貨謀速脫　米價再瀉二元左右</h3>
<p>杜梗　昨日各帮來源、因風雨所阻、河下全無到頭、而車輪包子亦屬寥寥、祇二千餘包、不過市面跌風仍熾、乃以市貨旣夥、而作客因風雨大作、范市者寥寥、且見日來市面一路猛甩、心思已餒、除本街店胃略事添購外、鮮有多進、故銷塲淸寂、市塲上籌碼充塞、又呈供過於求、客家欲免虧蝕、遂再猛甩、謀其速脫、但價格愈小、人心愈淡、結果各粳及陳新各尖、再瀉二元左右、計做開高錫粳卅三元、决至二十九元、蘇同崑粳三十元、二十九元、河下早晚稻二十八元、原包三十元二十九元、陳蕪尖三十元至二十七元、新尖二十四元、江北高新尖二十七元至二十五元、嘉善新川尖二十四元、新洋尖二十六元至二十五元半、杜尖二十五元半、變元未開、統計全市成交數三千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日車輪到數雖見略减、然貨方心思虛軟、莫不急圖求脫、而各路新秈與低决受潮各米允在貶價圖售、而進户则恐後市再跌、反無需要、市面隨在供多於求中、再見慘跌、新陳各秈均有再度跌落二元左右、特客秈祇有二十八九元、决新秈祇一十三元半、糙秈中决者已小至二十元以內、但人心尚未見定、緣江北一帶似已弛禁、長江各埠亦可搬運、後首來源或能絡繹不絕云、</p>
<h3>麺粉廠盘　開跌二角　小麥停頓</h3>
<p>麵粉　現粉交易、續呈萎靡、蓋自回籠貨步跌以來、廠盤早難穩站、昨以米價再度下跌、市上回籠貨棧單流出者更多、而實銷僅恃本街零星去化、南北客銷、一時更難望活動、故人心軟化、各廠亦不得不自動貶跌、昨日起二號粉廠盤已改爲四元二角現鈔、比前回降二角、統市成交的計二萬包左右、</p>
<p>小麥　小麥來源、因風雨關係、到貨銳减、各廠進胃雖稱蟬聯、而吃盤重視、均擬殺價而進、國戶需要已絕、故市面疲莫能興、全日間概無正式成交、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗銷港帮復活　雙馬牌價高停頓　雙地球天女反俏</h3>
<p>紗市又轉高翔、但實際交易、香港帮稍見活動、辦去四百九十包、惟素來旺辦之二十支雙馬紗、該帮近來意嚮忽然轉趨淡泊、茲據市塲言、在廣西有疑賓發生、被當局扣留、於是雙馬銷勢、大殺風景、故對於中身紗紛紛採辦、因之二十支雙地球天女兩牌、售價轉見高昂、實則雙馬價格太高、予其同一廠中之出品、二十支天女要相差百元之鉅、就目前情况觀之、或可軋攏　步矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開傳言香港帮有辦胃、同業口齒一齊喊高、然價過高、吃客不見、相延至九時五十分將近十點鐘時、廣帮先購二十支雙地球價高十五元、雙馬一度曾亂喊、然買老不擁、開價爲六百八十元、少頃回跌十元、但其他紗價勿動、中途低價到六百六十五元、收盤又見回升、查半日成交統計一千〇七十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲十元、天女雙地球漲二十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分別如左香港四九〇　內地　七〇同行五一五　統計一，〇七五</p>
<h3>新花全場　現棉廠辦觀望</h3>
<p>現棉交易、完全入於停頓狀態中、在此新棉不久當可大量登塲之際廠方皆觀望不進、近日雖潮汛猛烈、風在雨暴、沿海濱一帶之棉田、當然受遭影饗、其他部份、無大損害、前日首批來滬之通花價爲一百〇九元、掃數售罄矣、本日因颶風襲滬、蘇北輪航停駛、未見到貨、現棉全無做開云、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來殊爲靜寂、各同業對各方局勢暫抱觀望態度、交易雖靜、然詢之棉價則異常高昂、近日因關金價高、棉稅每担增起五角餘、故各同業之心意頗爲堅定、</p>
<p>外棉調價、紐約棉市、昨日因歐局略轉鬆懈、棉市因而較呈　躍、晨初即因海外棉商之購買、激漲十餘鎊音、嗣後因南方帮在市套賣及一部份多頭了結、市况略形轉疲、結果收盤時較之上日尚漲十二三磅昔、印度昨日停市、今日之預測、與昨日收盤價無甚軒輊、埃及跌七八磅音、利物浦跌十餘便士、</p>
<h3>疋頭　粗細斜紋布　開價下降　交易亦清</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨颶風過境、風在雨縣、本街門市生意絕跡、客銷亦愈形淸淡、新交易殊少訂開、蓋以市勢疲軟、購戶愈抱觀望、故市盤僅白貨略有更動、細布細斜每疋跌二三角，粗布粗斜跌一二角、本街批發號微有添辦四五十件、惟昨値月底、定貨交解、較平時稍忙、然本月份定貨餘額已寡、遠無前數月之旺盛矣、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>昨白貨細布·細斜·因北路寮皇島帮略有動辦、本　同業亦以月底期迫、一部份抵補空頭、故全日成交數量達六七百件、市盤每疋喊高一二角、十二磅龍頭細布現貨須十七元八角、寳貝細斜現貨索價十六元二角半、棧單爲十六元一角、</p>
<h3>平厚呢交易暢達</h3>
<p>昨平厚呢客帮咸有需辦、本埠舊貨帮大衣作塲亦有添進、致市勢見俏、大批發戶開出頗旺、向洋行出貨者極夥、下檔貨更爲俏俐、標準行市復見狂漲、七〇七漲到六元淨盤、一〇八〇漲到五元六角淨盤、同業中所存不多、蓋波蘭現貨行家亦多已售罄、新貨爲外滙關係、已多拍電緩裝、偶有少數進口、其血本每碼須七元之譜、因之行家現貨大盤、刻一律喊批七元</p>
<h3>糖市　外電回小　公會劃盤仍昂</h3>
<p>昨糖市據倫敦電訊、十二月份爲六先令〇七五、小二辦士二五、明年三月份六先令　辦士七五、小二辦士、六月份六先令二辦士、小二辦士二五、本市公會劃盤、現貨廿四號粗白本棧四十三元二角、升半元、外棧四十三元、升八角、轉口仍三十三元、太古車白東棧B嘜升五角至七角、初爲四十七元、後升至四十七元二角、西棧升二角、爲四十七元二角、後亦呌緊、CW嘜四十六元九角、CX嘜四十六元六角、DY嘜四十六元二角、HX嘜四十六元、H嘜車赤三十元六角、荷赤現貨升七角、爲四十元三角、轉口升半元、爲三十三元半、本綿白及一號冰均無上落、國糖趨勢仍堅、無成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑瓜子歉收步升</h3>
<p>黑瓜子近以產區有水患、收成大减、辦價已一再步升、據電濟魁子已升至四十四元、此間市勢因亦隨緊、昨聞毫州子一百包、三十五元、臨淮子四十三包、三十二元、寳應子七十餘包、三十八元、銅城子五六十包、四十元、普通濟魁子二十餘包、四十元至四十二元、</p>
<h3>新海南圓肉　行盤回小五元</h3>
<p>海南元肉、登新後二批到數較多、號盤已見略鬆、故行盤亦不得不稍跌、以迎合銷路、前市降去五元、售一百零五元、嗣後如到數不多、則此價當可暫立、</p>
<h3>藥材　山柰到稀存薄　售價比升十元</h3>
<p>山奈前市售開三十三元後，近以來源已絕、此間底積更覺空虛、號方於是扳緊、不肯輕放、前日成交十包、其價爲四十三元、比升十元、如去路通暢、尚看續昂、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤有到</h3>
<p>舶來品之白煤、近來因歐洲風雲緊張、恐一旦戰事爆發、航運將受阻梗、而致影響來源、人心防荒、市氣銳盛、但據最近觀察、殊爲不確、除鴻基白煤、絡繹有到外、日前威利輪又向法屬裝來馬克白煤三千餘噸、在租界上棧、同業行拆、塊煤每噸九十五元、碼頭排車、酌加行槓</p>
<h3>五金　白鐵管與水汀管　行情太高銷路俱呆</h3>
<p>白鐵管　近來交易大爲减色、良由行情太高、客商均觀望不辦、本埠自來水廠、雖不能缺乏此貨、但所購數亦日見减少、惟開價因匯兌緊縮關係、反比前漲起二三角至一二元不等、現市四吩每呎售七角八分、六吩八角八分、一吋一元二角、一吋四吩一元六角五分、二吋二元八角、三時五元、</p>
<p>泗汀管　鐵路推本埠建筑帮獨盛、唯外埠則大减、其最大之影響係亦受行情太貴、門市零星雖有買賣、然爲數不廣、刻如一吋四吩每呎沽二元二角半、二吋三元二、二吋五吩四元七</p>
<h3>絲茶　意國人造絲到滬</h3>
<p>意國人造絲有二百四十件、係前日二十八日進口之意輪汝廉該薩號（譯音）裝來、該項人造絲本市祇九十件、其餘一百五十件係轉往天津、聞該輪並裝呢絨三百餘箱、查人造絲另有十件、運往香港、</p>

<h3>說文壇上的「隱」（下）</h3>
<p>— 秦佬</p>
<p>從這歷史的發展上看來，目前我們文士父復活了的反筆名運動，也當然是更進一步的「進步」。</p>
<p>要說出這更進一步的「進步」底特色，也並不難。</p>
<p>首先，目前運動底性質更加複雜得多了。第一個時期用筆名的作家雖然負了「盜竊行爲」，但據反對者底口氣看來，只要不用筆名，那惡謚也就可以取消。第二個時期雖然反對者底方法可怕，用筆名的作家若是有眞的一怒而寫出眞姓名的時候，卽刻就要吃大虧的，但反對者表面上所爲的却也還是一般的老調，你要不理，他們還是沒有法子的。目前却就不然了。我們底文士一面在駡你「隱」起來楚卑汚，一定就給你一頂可怕的帽子。那作用是：假使你一怒而寫出眞姓名來，不用說是罪人，同時假使你依然用筆名，却還是罪八，總之是要你無法脫逃。這種周密的「法網」，實在可以使人佩服到無可佩服。</p>
<p>其次，目前的文士不但沒有第一個時期底祖宗底笨相，而且比第二個時期底祖宗還要聰明。第一個時期底反筆名論者雖然後來自己也用起了筆名，但在當時却實在都是一行不改姓，坐不改各」的，第二個時期底反筆名論者在這一點上也還有幾分笨，他們爲了駡人，自己也還肯露一露眞實的嘴臉的。目前却也不然了我們底文士儘管在駡別個一隱一，其實自己也在「隱」着，而且越是駡得兇，「隱」身法便越變得快。那正像包探在捉「反動份子」一樣：被捉者爲了自衛，不得不化裝，而捉人者一面駡他狡猾，一面自己却化裝得更厲害。這作風也是値得佩服的。</p>
<p>憑了這樣更進一步的「進步」，於是我們文士便向用筆名的人理直氣壯地吼着道：「你出來！要是好漢，你出來！</p>
<p>但眞的會一「出來」嗎？我看未必。</p>
<p>因爲「出來」或不「出來」，都一樣是罪人，還是索性「隱」得牢一點，不「出來」的好。還有，一看見吼着呌你「出來」的人穿戴的是歐洲中世紀底盔甲，一身都裹在鐵片裏面，只露着兩個眼睛，而却要你學現代底游泳家，赤裸裸地出塲，只要想一想，覺得也還是不「出來」的好。—一句話：世上沒有這樣的傻子的。</p>
<p>這樣看來，作家大概還要「隱」下去的，雖有我們熱心的文士，也怕難挽回這頹運。文壇也終於難有「光明的一天了。嗚呼！</p>
<h3>關于牙齒</h3>
<p>— 曹希欽珂著　羅洪譯</p>
<p>我們的刖友愛哥立奇有點兒牙齒毛病。那些牙齒都要開始動搖了。</p>
<p>當然啦，時間對於這類病痛是很有關係的。年紀老了，所謂齒部的天然機構給破壞了，筋骨變得軟弱起來，而牙齒也不中用起來。</p>
<p>伊凡·愛哥立奇·沙薩奇夫去年跟我同居的時候，他開始晚落牙齒。</p>
<p>第一個牙齒，的確在跟別人爭論的時候，給人家敲掉的，其他的幾個，都是無緣無故牠們自己掉了下來。譬如有時他正在吃什麼束西，便脫了下來，有時候正在談論工資高下的問題，牙齒便分碎下來了，有時候他一個人在着，牙齒也會爆碎了的。這眞是最奇怪的事情。在一個短短的時期內，他脫落了六個牙齒。</p>
<p>可是愛哥立奇並不怎樣在意，他不怕會變成一個沒有牙齒的人，他是去保險了的。假如他需要的時候，他可以立刻去讓牙齒裝了起來。對於這個計劃他很得意，常常這樣說：</p>
<p>「關於牙齒我是一點兒不吝嗇的。牠們脫掉了我能够使牠們再產生出來。我從求讓誰碰到我的鼻子或臉上任何地方，但對於牙齒，我倒無所謂的。我並不担心，我們保險了的人是十分安全的。」</p>
<p>所以愛哥立奇脫落了六個牙齒的時候，他決定去作第一决的修理了。他帶了那張保險單，坐了小車到省立齒科醫院去。</p>
<p>那些臨診醫師很高興地去接待他。</p>
<p>「當然了，」他們說。「我們可以給你修補起來，用一個金屬的托子。那麼你脫落了幾個呢？我們保險章程的規定，沒脫落到八個牙齒，便不發生效用的。假如你脫落八個以上，那是你的幸運也就是我們的不幸了。如果你並未脫到八個；我們便不能對你做什麼了。齒科醫生不能耗費時光在這些瑣事上面。那章程是規定着保險這個數目的。」</p>
<p>「我是脫落六個，」愛哥立奇告訴他們。</p>
<p>「我們很抱歉，」他們說，</p>
<p>「現在我們對你不能做什麼啊、朋友，等你脫落了八個牙齒再來吧！</p>
<p>愛哥立奇十分生氣了。</p>
<p>「怎麼？你們要我把牠去打掉嗎？爲什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「那當然不需要去打掉的了，」他們說。「你聽其自然好了，你等著。假如你幸運，只要牠們再脫落兩三個，我們就可以修補。」</p>
<p>從齒科醫院回到家裏，他的情緒是很激動的。關於牙齒的事情，他是明白了，現在是一切事情都出乎意外地複雜。</p>
<p>他希望着這多餘的兩三個牙齒，快點兒脫落。</p>
<p>一個是很快就脫掉了。另外的一個，愛哥立奇有時候，玩着把銼子去磨光的。當然那牙齒很快就從齒窩裏失掉了。</p>
<p>愛哥立奇立刻趕到了那齒科醫院。</p>
<p>『現在』，他說，『規約的條件都完備了——我已經脫落了八個牙齒。』</p>
<p>『那是好極了，』他們告訴他。『現在我們可以給你工作了。你那脫落的牙齒是不是在同一地位的呢？因爲依照我們的章程，八個牙齒要在一排上脫落的才行。假如牠們不是在同一地位，那我們還是不能做什麼的。八個牙齒脫落在不同的地方，我們還是不能去處理。當然你是明白的，要是脫落的牙齒不在一排上，那還是可以咀嚼東西呢！』</p>
<p>『牠們不是在同一地位上脫落的，』愛哥立奇說。</p>
<p>『那就抱歉了，我們不能做什麼的。』</p>
<p>可憐的愛哥立奇沒有什麼話好說了。他只能緊咬着剩餘的牙齒，生氣地走出了齒科醫院。</p>
<p>眞是何等的失望啊。他只能樂天安命地生活着，一切的希望都掃地無餘了。</p>
<p>從此以後，愛哥立奇變換了他的生活方式。他生活得很安靜，只吃液體的東西，每天刷三次牙齒。</p>
<p>在這樣的謹愼之下，齒科醫院的章程，才有了很好的結果。</p>

<h3>地下火（書評）</h3>
<p>— 楊非</p>
<p>「地下火」是一冊描寫德國卍字魔掌下「非法活動」的「長篇報告文學」。</p>
<p>著者德國列普曼（H.LiePmann）「並不是一個社會中義者，也不是任何政黨的黨員」，而且據他說，「他自己並沒有確定的政治信條」：不過，當時他正担任着一家美國報紙的通訊員，同時他「相信一個作家應該是一個有道德的人」，因而他不但詳密地查考着納粹治下各種事件的眞相，把它們正確地報道出來，並且他對於那些艱苦而英勇的「被摑」的黨人，賦予深切的同情，盡力助帮着「非法組織」的建立和活動。</p>
<p>列普曼的正義感不但掛在口頭上，並且藏於行動中。而這也正使他得到許多搜集秘密消息的便利，使他的認識從表面而深入到內裏，使他的報告更詳確而眞實。</p>
<p>「地下火」中，開頭寫納粹焚燒國會以誣陷共黨放火，於是乎箝制人民的自由，捕殺他們的敵黨，在刺刀下舉行大選而操得專政之權：於是乎社會主義者轉入了地下活動，在密探軍警的蜘蛛網下，屢經破獲失敗而冉三結集奮鬥。無賴做了要員，變節者升了官職，爲籌得結婚費用而當了黨衛團員；而另一方面，却在失業貧困之中，爲了信仰而進行宜傳，計劃暴動，從事反虐政的工作。在這樣的氛圍之下，親戚變做敵人，夫婦反了面目，情侶成了寃家。然而革命者却甘冒危險，忍受犧牲，爲了耍煽起「地下火」！</p>
<p>陰謀，恐怖，緊張，慘烈，果毅，勇敢，—這不是傳奇，而都是事實。列普曼藉着多方面的記叙，來表現出在朝和在野兩種勢力的內景，來揭示出高壓和苦鬥許多事件的原委，那是靠著他不　麻煩，各方探聽，而且新身參與其事地勞作的結果。他與共產黨，社會民主黨，社會主義青年團…等的領袖和黨團接觸，同時也與希特勒的特派員，納粹的問諜，和黨衛團員…們接觸；他跑進了羣衆，密室，同時也走人了警察廳和監獄中。這些實在的見聞和體騐，他便了成筆下豐富而眞確的材料。</p>
<p>在這冊書中，並沒有誇大的描摩，也不見想像的補充—這些放到小說中去是更適當些—而這是「卷血淋淋的實錄。裏面寫着暴徒，但是並不個個寫得像猛獸，他們也有一部份受着革命者的薰染：裏面寫着英雄，但是並不偭偭寫得像天神，他們也常遇到險難而驚恐變色。這是一部悲壯的人問劇，「每一件事情，都是經過詳細調查而得到的事實一，然而的確令人讀來感到悲壯。</p>
<p>列普曼的行文也很緊凑而有技巧。他常是在書前挿寫著一些似乎是偶然逢到的關節，而到後來事實的發展却和那些關節起了聯繋；這樣的「呼應」法非特筆調驚險，而且也是更「寫實」的。有些事件，他沒有加上多少描寫的說明，但已經暗示出它們的因果關係了。那一種記賬式的繁瑣而浪費的筆墨是沒有的。</p>
<p>這種寫作的態度和技術，希望吾國的報告文學的作者能够注意。</p>
<p>這書現在已有中譯本，譯者朱雯。朱雯的譯筆，流利通暢，堪稱名著，佳譯。</p>

<p>— 水燕</p>
<p>陳少霖乘木桶到站返平</p>
<p>天津洪水爲患，本埠早有所聞，而適在津市法租界中國大戲院演唱之章遏雲陳少霖葉盛蘭王士英侯喜瑞馬富祿等一行，亦遭逢此災，八月二十日臺上正演天河配將畢，時的七句鍊，水突擁入，竟與戲臺相平，於是一般角色，無不大起恐慌，紛紛逃至惠中飯店，但水已將及屋頂，葉盛蘭等七人，立刻以每人二十元之代價，僱得一隻小船，當日即乘船至火車站，乘車逃返北平，狼狽不堪。常時因船小人多，不勝擁擠，名鬚生陳少霖因上船不及，改乘一木桶，以善游泳者二人代爲撑划，始得浮達車站，冒險返平，亦云幸矣。聞名坤伶章遏雲，常時亦隨衆逃至屋頂，然因事出倉猝，各人祇管自逃生命，無人顧及，當衆人僱船時，遏雲尚在尾頂，以後有無生命危險，尚不可知，但食糧則已烏有，章伶之生命殆矣哉！</p>
<h3>莫里哀交好運</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>法國大喜劇作家莫里哀近來在上海交了好運，各劇團接連地排演他老人家的戲，並且都給牠穿上中國裝。首先是中法劇社的「裝腔作勢，」這是嘲笑法國當時沙龍風氣的，經馮執中先生一改，就轉而嘲笑我國花呀月呀的吃奶詩人。接着是新演據社的「僞君子，」這是諷刺宗敎僞善者的。本來中法劇社還想演「理想夫人」把背景放在無錫。最近浦東大樓璇宮據院又上演莫里哀的「生財有道」了。這就是以前高眞常所譯的「慳吝人，」經顧仲彝光生改編的。</p>
<p>李健吾先生把「生財有道」與元曲鄭廷玉的「看錢奴」並論，頗具卓見·他如一文錢羅夢之類，雜劇傳奇中還有不少·大的酒色財氣合爲四劇者允爲常見，所謂財就是形容慳吝人的。在詞藻與結構上說，莫里哀喜歡白描，與當時喜愛華麗詞藻者不相融洽；他的戲劇又都是引人發笑的·這吶點頗近似我國的李漁和沈起鳳，時代也極相近。所不同者，我國喜劇專重功名當貴，才子佳人，對於人生，毫無啟示：莫里哀却毫不容情地剝下一般魈魅的衣服，使他們赤裸裸地顯露出來，因此幾乎莫里哀無一種戲劇不惹起麻煩，大家都以爲莫里哀是駡的他們自己，於是羣起攻擊，雖有路易十叫保鏢亦無用處，落得後來死時，還只好偷偷地舉行葬儀。</p>
<p>莫里哀有着很豐富的舞台經騐，「生財有道」的效果是不錯的，它確能不絕地引起台下的笑聲</p>
<p>重要演員方面，如鄭重吳銘沈敏周起等，都是極成功的。最値得一提的是最後的結婚的決定，大家主張節省結婚費捐給國家，話方出口，台下都鼓起掌來，足見上海民衆對於愛護國家的熱忱。</p>

<h3>各旦于素蓮小姐談　舞臺生活及願望（下）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>愛唱的戲</p>
<p>當在搭班「卡爾登」那一時期，諸如小生，小丑，彩且等各類角色，除大花臉之外，差不多都會胡亂演過；自從加入「黃金」以後，專演老戲。正工的花杉戲是比較演得最多，但遇邀來平角兒是唱花衫的角色，我的戲目亦就常演靑衣了。一般的說來：自己認爲較量愛好的戲劇，靑衣戲是喜唱「敎子」「祭江」「祭塔」等苦戲，花衫戲則愛飾「花田錯」「鬧學」「打櫻桃」諸劇之小丫頭一類角色；因爲苦戲凄惻動人，最富眞情感；小丫頭這角色，演出天眞活潑的情調，則是很自然的儘得自由發揮，不用怎樣的做作：換句話說，這類戲和自己年齡也很相稱，耍如再過幾年之後，或許就不甚適宜了。</p>
<p>日常生活</p>
<p>每天的生活情形，可說是習於機械化的：早晨規定七時起床，隨由兩位琴師拉胡琴吊嗓子歷一小時，九時至十時練工－跑圓塲與刀馬旦戲應用的武工。下午，習崑曲一小時，傍晚，就鄰近補習學校，專修央文兩小時。但如遇有日戲，或排練新戲時，這下半天的課程，便無法兼顧，常非歸於荒廢不可了</p>
<p>唯一願望</p>
<p>想要到北平去從各師學戲，力求深造，是我積想數年的唯一願望。從去年離開「卡爾登」後，一腦經只是充滿了要到北方去的心念；目前，「黃金」當局雖尚堅不放行，自己總屬念念不己，無論如何，決非早謀北上投師，完成這番心願不可。預定計劃：將來到那裏去往上兩年，仍是半工半諫辦法，一面唱戲，一面學戲。因爲北方戲院慣例，每禮拜通常演戲不過二三次；即使要搭班子，對於學戲這工作亦是毫沒妨礙的。</p>
<p>末了，我以爲一般人的目光，對於我們吃戲飯的人大都看得比較普通職業界爲低微，這等觀念實在太不公平；我們戲行裏思想，與人格同樣高超的人也正多着哩，常不免於受及這樣謬怏的歧視，那眞是一件甚大的憾事！</p>

<h3>上海劇藝社　重演「花濺淚」</h3>
<p>「花濺淚」去年三度在卡爾登，新光上演。這次上海劇藝社聽說有重演「花濺淚」的意思。並且是四慕全部演出。據已經宜佈原班的陣容，非常堅强。如莫言的常海才，徐立的小李都是非常出色的。在「沉淵」中演倪硯卿獲得成功的屠光啟，來演金石音當然亦不弱。夏霞的丁香，藍蘭的米米自然都不錯。</p>
<p>聽說「花濺淚」從九月一日起演。本劇的導演仍歸由電影導演吳永剛來担任，他是「花濺淚」的老導演，先前的處女獻演也是吳先生担任導演的，那末這一次「精益求精」，成績一定可以担保的。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>新建戲館有開門破台諸迷信</p>
<p>凡在內地當戲館老闆的人，十九都係安淸中較有聲望的人物，跑江湖班的伶工也須有此門檻，方不致吃了大虧。雲龍舞臺的臺主曹某，也是安淸中的前輩，當時曾勾來老伶工孟燮卿同孟的高徒單德元，燮卿私淑名凈黃潤甫，工架唱白俱甚老練，彼於副凈之外，復擅武老生及關據甚多。惟其人腦筋極舊，迷信甚深，按梨園本有「臺上不讀更（耕改續京）臺下不說夢」的慣例，因此凡遇姓孟的（夢孟同音）旁人都以「黃梁子」稱之。（本黃梁一夢之說）燮卿旣姓孟，倘有人請敎他的姓名，他就給你個「黃梁子燮卿」五個字一串的答復。假使你是個外行人，聽罷之後，表示詫異的話，那末，他情願拿筆寫個孟字讓你瞧，但是他却始終不說「孟」的。他初到戲館子裏一看，原來是造在一片沙灘之上的一所房屋，該處本係黃河故道，一遇夏秋雨水衆多的時令，整個的戲館子完全泡在水裏。他一想這事可有些蹊蹺，園名呌作「雲龍」，有水的季節，龍在水中當然舒適，可是戲就不用唱啦，等於關門大吉。要是時逢春冬，館子周國沒水，戲固然照演，然而「龍困沙灘，虎落平陽」，這都是不大吉利的成語，怎麼一所好好的雲龍舞臺，偏偏要建造在沙灘上，這不是太沒常識了麼？（九〇）</p>

<h3>Germany Replies to Britain, Still Insisting on Territorial Demands on Poland, Sacrificing Sovereignty is Unacceptable to Poland, but the Door to Diplomatic Negotiations Remains Open</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler's reply to Britain was delivered to Henderson last night. The question of war or peace in Europe will soon be decided. The German reply was personally handed to Henderson by Hitler at the Chancellery at 7:15 PM last night. Hitler and Henderson then held a 25-minute discussion. After Henderson left, Hitler received the Italian Ambassador, with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also present. After Hitler's reply was sent, the Nazi Party expressed considerable optimism about the situation, believing that Hitler was willing to resolve the German-Polish dispute peacefully. However, they still consider the situation to be extremely serious. Hitler considered the reply to Britain until late the night before, sleeping for only a few hours. He then dictated the content of the reply into a recording machine, which was transcribed by his female secretary, and then revised by Hitler himself. The German Ambassador to Italy will return to Berlin within a few days to report on his duties. (30th Associated Press)</p>
<p>(London) Authoritative sources here announced last night that the talks between Prime Minister Hitler and the British Ambassador to Germany on Sunday did not reveal any encouragement for a peaceful resolution of the Polish-German dispute. Prime Minister Hitler reiterated Germany's assurance of friendship to Britain, but he more firmly presented his demands on Poland. An official of the responsible diplomatic authority stated that Prime Minister Hitler formally demanded the return of Upper Silesia, Danzig, and the Polish Corridor to Germany. This demand includes one-third of Polish territory. (30th Associated Press)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources here today, Hitler's reply to Chamberlain demanded that Poland send representatives to Germany for negotiations within 24 hours. The condition was that Poland agree to hand over Danzig and the Polish Corridor to Germany before the negotiations. The time limit was midnight tonight. According to Henderson, Hitler's reply was no different from a "letter of resignation." (30th Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Warsaw) Polish political circles today received news that Hitler demanded that Poland hand over Danzig and the Corridor before negotiations even began. They immediately stated that Hitler's demands were absolutely unacceptable. This demand is a blatant disregard for Polish sovereignty. (30th Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to well-informed sources, the German reply to Britain this time seems to be longer than the letter from Head of State Hitler to French Premier Daladier. Although it reviews the current situation from all aspects, in essence, all possible avenues remain open. However, direct negotiations between Germany and Poland are not possible. (29th Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Political figures here say that the possibility of negotiations still exists, but Germany's attitude towards general issues has not changed. The demands regarding Danzig and the Corridor are not open to further discussion. The "Berlin Evening News" stated, "The city of Danzig and the Corridor have already expressed their allegiance to Germany. This can be seen by observing the local situation. Britain and France must not use other reasons to evade these facts." The "Hamburg Local Daily" published an editorial stating, "The exchange of official documents between Britain and Germany is to explore the root causes of the current crisis. The lofty ideal of reorganizing world peace based on British-German cooperation has been undermined by Britain's change of political policy in March of this year, adopting an anti-German stance. Since then, Britain has refused to acknowledge that to build a new Europe, the Treaty of Versailles must be overturned. Therefore, Head of State Hitler's goal of conducting negotiations to correct the mistakes of 1919 has not been realized. The greatest wound that Germany has suffered since the war is Danzig and the Corridor. This wound hinders Germany's belief in adjusting peace. Only after the wound is healed can the European situation show a bright future." (30th Reuter)</p>
<p>(London) A German plane arrived from Berlin at Heston Aerodrome in the suburbs this morning. It is impossible to know who the passengers were. The Air Ministry and the German Embassy both said they knew nothing about it. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The British government's reply to Hitler is expected to be sent to Berlin today. The content of the reply is designed to ensure that Hitler does not cease sending documents to the British government. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Times stated that the key to German relations lies in Germany completely abandoning the method of using threats of force in its dealings with other countries. Therefore, Germany's method of dealing with Poland is a test of whether Germany is prepared to conduct negotiations with other countries using methods that can establish international agreements. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that no country welcomes peace more enthusiastically than Britain, but Britain will never allow Hitler to do as he pleases in Poland. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to the German News Agency, Hitler, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, received Ambassador Henderson at 6:15 PM last night and presented him with Hitler's reply to the British government's note. It is expected that this reply will be carried to London by a secretary of the British Ambassador on a special plane. It is reported that Hitler carefully considered Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons before completing this reply. It is reported that the content of this reply is quite detailed. The German original was handed to Henderson last night. Henderson went to see Hitler alone, and Hitler made oral explanations on points not included in the reply. The "Essen National Daily" published a commentary on this matter, saying, "The Head of State is still ready to study various reasonable proposals at any time and is constantly striving to achieve a necessary solution. This attitude can be a model for any politician in the world. However, the continuation of British-German diplomatic talks cannot ease the tension of the situation. It can only be eased after Germany's just demands are met." (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Carefully Studies German Reply, Downing Street Diplomatic Activities</h3>
<p>(London) Hitler's reply was delivered to the British Foreign Office late last night. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately studied it for an hour and a half. A cabinet meeting was held at 10:30 this morning to discuss it and adjourned at 11:55. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) There were no significant developments in the situation this morning. However, the British Cabinet held an important meeting at 10:30 AM to study Hitler's reply. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax discussed the German reply late into the night and deliberated for a long time, Chamberlain still took his usual walk in St. James's Park at 9:30 this morning before returning to 10 Downing Street. Before the Cabinet meeting, he met with several cabinet members. French Ambassador Corbin went to the British Foreign Office before noon. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet met this morning to discuss two matters: conveying Hitler's reply to the governments of Poland and other countries, and Britain's further response to Hitler. The meeting adjourned at 11:55 AM without setting a date for a continued cabinet meeting. Reuters reporters learned that this was probably because it was necessary to consult with other governments, so no date was set for the cabinet meeting. It was also learned that the content of the German reply to Britain was telegraphed to British Ambassador to Warsaw Kennard this morning to convey it to Polish Foreign Minister Beck. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office was extremely active this morning. French Ambassador Corbin was the first to arrive at the Foreign Office and held talks for 40 minutes. He was immediately informed of the content of the German government's reply. Romanian Minister Tilea, Dutch Minister Wovwen, and Brazilian Ambassador Zhenlifanla also arrived at the Foreign Office one after another. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Sources close to the government here recently stated that when the British reply to Germany first reached Berlin, the reaction was quite unfavorable. In addition to demanding the return of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, Germany also made further demands. At that time, the hope of saving peace was quite weak. It is hoped that the German government will change its mind. In addition, there are various existing factors, such as (1) the Soviet Union has delayed ratifying the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty; (2) former French Chief of Staff General Weygand has been ordered to go to the Near East; (3) Japan and Spain are increasingly alienated from Germany; (4) Germany's attempt to use Hungary as a base for attacking Poland does not seem to be accepted by Hungary. All of these factors are enough to bring some comfort to the general public. (29th Havas)</p>
<h3>Prescribing the Right Medicine to Cure the Chronic Illness, Italian Prime Minister Expresses Views</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian People's Daily (Mussolini's mouthpiece) stated today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is currently focusing on finding a solution to the Danzig problem, but feels that solving this problem alone cannot appease Europe. According to Mussolini's view, what is needed now is a comprehensive solution, and all pending issues should be resolved. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian People's Daily recently commented on the current situation, stating that at this time of worldwide crisis, the world is calling on Prime Minister Mussolini to come forward and save peace. But what is meant by peace is unknown. Perhaps this is not like a temporary pain reliever, merely seeking to muddle through without considering the recurrence of chronic illnesses. Indeed, all the sources of Europe's illnesses come from the Treaty of Versailles. If there were no such treaty, all illnesses could be cured immediately. This is a clear matter of reason. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government authorities have already taken various air defense measures, and blackout regulations have been implemented. It is generally advising people to leave Rome and major cities. All private cars will be prohibited from driving starting on the 3rd of next month. The food supplied by restaurants across the country is also restricted. The general public is quite anxious, believing that the situation is extremely critical and that the government is about to make an important decision. Fascist Party members say that European countries have successively closed their borders, but negotiations are still underway, so there is still hope for a peaceful resolution of the current crisis.

<h3>Attempted Invasion of Du Ruan Jing Gen Failed, Japanese Troops Have Retreated to Jiangmen, Chinese Troops in Tingbei Won Victory in Attacking Taolin, Japanese and Puppet Troops on the South Bank of the Xiu River Suffered Setbacks, Contested Battle Unfolded in the Suburbs of Changzhi</h3>
<p>(Zhaoqing) The Japanese troops who invaded Du Ruan Jing Gen were bravely countered by the Chinese troops and retreated to Jiangmen. On the evening of the 29th, more than 300 Japanese troops again invaded the Daijingtou and Tangxia area from Jiangmen. The Chinese defenders gave them a heavy blow, and they are still in a stalemate in the Huangcun area. (30th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Wengyuan) More than 100 Japanese troops from Baishi in Dongguan invaded Yulan on the morning of the 29th. The Chinese side has dispatched troops to intercept them. (29th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Miluo) The Chinese troops in northern Hunan attacked Taolin and Zhongfang. On the 30th, the troops advanced to the Majiadong area north of Zhongfang and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops, killing more than 200 Japanese troops. The Chinese troops also suffered considerable casualties. Another advancing Chinese force attacked Pingshuipu between Yuezhou Yanglou on the 26th, killing more than 20 Japanese troops, seizing a rifle, a horse, and capturing a translator officer, Jing Yuyuan, and others. (30th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Zhangshu) On the morning of the 24th, more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops invaded villages in the Sunjiabu area south of Yangzhou on the south bank of the Xiu River. They were bravely resisted by local people who formed self-organized teams. As a result, the Japanese and puppet troops were repelled, and dozens of Japanese and puppet troops were killed. Currently, people in the occupied areas of northern Jiangxi are voluntarily forming armed guerrilla teams to defend their hometowns and resist the war. (30th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Zhangshu) More than 300 Japanese troops repeatedly invaded the area west of Chiyouzhuang, north of Gaoan, along Chenjiabian at 11:00 PM on the 28th. After the Chinese Kou troops bravely fought back, the Japanese troops were defeated by the Chinese troops after a fierce battle until dawn on the 29th, and many military supplies were seized. (29th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The battle for Changzhi City is still going on fiercely. Since the Chinese four-way siege has approached the suburbs of the city, the Japanese troops are panic-stricken and intensifying their defense. They are currently rushing to build fortifications on the east-west line of Xinyicun (southwest of Changzi) in an attempt to hold on to the death. There are still more than 2,000 Japanese troops in Changzi City, with 11 artillery pieces. There are still 7 or 8 Japanese guard units in Daxiaobaotou in the south of the city and in the Shijiao Township Yanglucun area in the west of the city. A certain Chinese unit is stepping up its efforts to eliminate them. At the same time, another unit has advanced from the vicinity of Lianchengzhen (northeast of Gaoping) towards Huguan (east of Changzhi). Moreover, due to recent heavy rains, many roads near Changzhi have been washed away, making it more difficult for the Japanese troops to resupply. It will not be difficult for the Chinese troops to encircle and annihilate them in the short term. (30th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) According to a military officer returning from the front, since the Chinese successively conquered strongholds such as Jincheng and Gaoping in southeastern Shanxi, the Japanese troops have been defeated and fled, with numerous deaths and injuries. Even the wounded soldiers being transported to Houma have reached more than 3,000, and some of them are being transferred to Linfen. Those who are seriously injured and incurable are burned alive en route, and the situation is extremely miserable. (30th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Fancheng) The Hubei central war situation, with dense clouds but no rain, has not yet unfolded. The Japanese troops entrenched in Yuekou, Qianjiang, and Xiantao are still transferring troops back and forth. The Japanese troops in Zhangjiegang are currently requisitioning more than 200 civilian boats in the Heilu Canal Yuekou area, linking three boats together to prepare to cross the river. (30th Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Japanese Invaded Boyu Mountain, Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>(Xinyu) According to recent Japanese claims, since the 10th, the Japanese troops who invaded Boyu Mountain north of Huajing'an from Tanxi had a total of more than 1,700 infantry and artillery troops and more than 400 cavalry troops. On the 11th, 93 people were killed and 123 were wounded near Boyu Mountain. By the 18th, more than 230 people had been wounded one after another. They are currently withdrawing to the rear for reorganization. This shows the intensity of the battle at that time and the heavy casualties suffered by the Japanese. (30th Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Northern Henan Forcibly Conscripting Strong Young Men</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) The war situation in northern Henan has been quiet for a long time. In addition to digging the Qin, Zhang, and Wei rivers in an attempt to submerge the Chinese people, the Japanese troops have recently been forcibly conscripting strong young men in various counties, training them, and enlisting them into the Japanese army. On the morning of the 28th, more than 250 Japanese troops from Qinyang and other places raided the 18 Licun east of Baixiang. They were ambushed by the Chinese × troops, and more than 20 Japanese troops were killed or wounded. They fled back the way they came. (30th Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Northeastern Changtaiguan Retreating to Yanghe</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) More than 500 Japanese soldiers who occupied the Fozudian northeast of Changtaiguan on the 26th were bravely attacked by the Chinese × troops. The Japanese troops were unable to resist and retreated to Yanghe on the 27th. (30th Telegraph)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Peace in British Hands</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's telegrams, the tension in Europe has reached its peak. Disputes on the German-Polish border continue to occur; the mobilization of various countries for war is almost complete; the response to calls for peace is extremely weak. At present, only the exchange of official documents between Britain and Germany is considered to be the peace door that has not been completely closed.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, on the eve of the outbreak of the First World War, French President Poincaré asked Britain to clearly express its assistance to France, saying that peace was in British hands; who knew that today, on the verge of another European war, peace is again in British hands. The theme of this German-Polish dispute is Germany's demand for the annexation of Danzig and the Polish Corridor; and Britain has a prior commitment to Poland to assist in resisting aggression, and five days ago signed a military alliance against aggression; therefore, although Germany's target is Poland, Germany's negotiating opponent is Britain. The recent exchange of official documents between Britain and Germany has not been publicly released. Although we can speculate that the main items in between are nothing more than the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues, Germany has repeatedly stated recently that Germany will not allow further discussion on these two issues in principle; then, what exactly are the two countries discussing, despite the trouble of exchanging official documents? If it is not that it has already involved a considerable range; then it is discussing more detailed items than principles!</p>
<p>British and French figures mostly believe that this British-German negotiation will never become a second Munich; in fact, whether this negotiation can jump out of Chamberlain's old path of appeasement is still the question. Judging from Germany's current firm attitude towards Poland, the only way for Britain, apart from forcing Poland to meet Germany's demands in exchange for peace, is to fight alongside Poland to prevent aggression. Then the peace that the Germans believe is in British hands will naturally be shattered without a trace, but whether this kind of peace is worth cherishing is also the question. The peace that we idealize and that the international community is currently striving for is different from the peace in Germany's mind; and it should be a genuine, worldwide, glorious peace. If we cannot strive for a worldwide, glorious peace, not only the consequences of a "Munich"-style peace are a lesson from the past, but even in the current situation, Poland may not be willing to listen to Britain's advice and sacrifice for an inglorious peace. Therefore, the key to peace is indeed in British hands; the determination of the nature and value of peace is also in British hands! The current Britain should abandon the policy of secret negotiations, clearly express a solemn attitude, and reject unfair demands. This is the peace that Britain holds! International evolution has given humanity many lessons. We believe that the British will use the peace in their hands with the most moral, most enlightened, and most solemn attitude?</p>
<p>Each country has its own national policy, and Britain and Germany are naturally no exception: national policy is fixed, but the implementation of national policy, whether real or illusory, each has its own different means. The current tense situation in Europe cannot but be considered tense and dangerous; but no one can determine whether it will become the Second European War. According to yesterday's Moscow telegram, it is rumored that the German Foreign Minister once gave Stalin a guarantee that although Germany is preparing for war, it will ultimately accept a plan to resolve the German-Polish dispute peacefully, which shows that Germany is not necessarily determined to go to war. What's more, the scars of the First European War are still there, so why would Germany be willing to destroy its new construction of more than 20 years in one fell swoop? Because of this, we are also unwilling to hastily determine the responsibility for destroying peace as a criminal iron case for Germany. Just like the resolution of various disputes, it is also necessary to find new standards of justice in order to seek fairness and lasting peace. If the British side can refrain from acting as one party of allied friends and regard itself as the protector of justice, then the peace it holds will surely be more valuable.</p>
<h3>Polish Government Announces General Mobilization Order, German Troops Enter Slovakia, Danzig Implements Rationing System</h3>
<p>Warsaw The Polish government announced a general mobilization order this afternoon. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>Warsaw It is heard that telephone communication between here and Danzig has now been suspended, and it is heard that the people of Danzig are now subject to a rationing system, the same as the Germans in Germany. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) News from Danzig here: since yesterday, several trains scheduled to go to Danzig have not arrived. It is reported that they were blocked by Poles at the border. The Danzig government has lodged a serious protest with Warsaw. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>Warsaw News of German violations of the Slovak border is now coming in like snowflakes. A spokesperson said that German soldiers wearing Slovak uniforms have invaded the border, making the situation even more tense. Germany has now completed its mobilization and troop deployment. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>Warsaw Poland has historically avoided being labeled as a troublemaker. It often avoids openly announcing mobilization. For example, Japan originally planned to announce a fifth-level mobilization yesterday, but temporarily canceled it after being advised by Britain. However, it is now heard that East Prussia has been fully mobilized, and Slovakia has also been completely occupied by German troops. Therefore, Poland is in a situation of being surrounded on three sides. At the same time, Poland's transportation with Lithuania and Romania is also threatened. Therefore, Poland decided today to openly announce mobilization, but it is beautifully called "security measures" instead of "mobilization". (30th Associated Press)</p>
<p>Warsaw General Smigly-Ridz issued a proclamation that was posted in the capital and various places, stating that the government authorities have decided to step up defensive measures militarily, and said, "We will never give up an inch of land, nor will we give up any rights. Anyone who dares to invade our country will be severely punished. In wartime, whether men, women, old or young, we should all become soldiers defending the country." After reading the proclamation, residents of various places were very calm. Air raid trenches have been dug in parks, squares, and open spaces in various places to prevent air raids. Therefore, the wife of Military and Political Minister General Piłsudski, who is already fifty years old, also participated in the trench digging work near her residence. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw Pessimism here about peace. Mobilized (to the last person, there are now 1.5 million soldiers mobilized nationwide. Officials announced that several cases of espionage plots have been discovered. A railway bridge in Norway was bombed, and several German suspects have been arrested in Upper Silesia. Polish newspapers say the German-Polish conflict has reached its peak, and war or peace will be decided within hours. The Polish government announced that the work of digging air raid shelters by people in various places is progressing very well. Currently, men, women, and children are participating in this work. German troops are gathering in the central part of the border. Various circles here speculate that the German troops may want to attack the important industrial area of Upper Silesia in one fell swoop. Ten divisions of German mechanized troops and 1,000 tanks are gathered near Marystol on the Polish border. (30th Associated Press)</p>
<h3>German Troops Control Slovakia</h3>
<p>Bratislava The Slovak State is entirely under German control. The German government has implemented military administration in the area. President and Prime Minister Tiso has ordered that all horses, vehicles, gasoline, etc. be supplied to the German troops. Anyone who endangers the German troops will be sent to the German military court for military trial. (30th Associated Press)</p>
<p>Bratislava Prime Minister Tiso received a telegram from Slovak immigrants in the United States yesterday, assuring him of their loyalty to the country. The telegram stated that Slovak immigrants in the United States are currently gathered in Chicago to hold a memorial service for the one-year anniversary of the death of Father Linjia, commemorating his achievements and taking the opportunity to express their loyalty to the country. (30th Haitong)</p>
<h3>Official Statement from Warsaw</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The official authorities in Warsaw issued a public statement at 1:00 PM, which reads, "Germany has been pursuing a policy of aggression against Poland for several months. This is evident through newspaper and public opinion attacks, threatening statements from authorities, provocative actions along the border, and the concentration of troops near the Polish border. Most recently, Germany has taken various actions within the Free City of Danzig that not only endanger Poland's legitimate rights but also aim to encroach upon Polish territory. Therefore, there is no doubt that Poland is under threat. However, Poland, faced with this situation, is still willing to sincerely accept the efforts of various allied governments and key figures from friendly nations to mediate and facilitate peace. Regrettably, Germany has not only failed to show sympathy but has also moved its troops into Slovakia, a neighboring country of Poland, yesterday. In view of this situation, the Polish government has no choice but to take defensive measures to ensure its safety. As for the policies of the Polish government, they have always been consistent: it has no aggressive ambitions towards any other country and is willing to cooperate with them faithfully. The fact that Polish President Mościcki responded to US President Roosevelt's call for peace is clear evidence of this." (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Polish Police Uncover Terrorist Organization</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The Polish police authorities have recently uncovered three German terrorist conspiracy organizations. The largest of these was led by Hans Stein, a German of Polish nationality, with three assistants: Brentel, a correspondent for a German news agency stationed in Katowice; Fränzel, the leader of the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) in Bochum, Germany; and Nelig, who was responsible for the numerous terrorist incidents that have occurred in Katowice. Stein has been arrested, and several bombs were found in five of the trunks in his home. The other two organizations were located in Poznan and Łódź, where a large number of pistols, light machine guns, and a significant amount of explosives were seized. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Germany Restricts Railway Transportation</h3>
<p>(London) According to a broadcast speech by German Transportation Minister Dorpmüller on various German radio stations, railway transportation in Germany will continue to be restricted. Starting today, the railways will not carry any private passengers. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Continued Disputes on the German-Polish Border</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Several disputes occurred today at the border between Poland and Germany/Slovakia. (1) A squad of German army sentries invaded Polish territory near Yamaripo Kokigevie in the Pomerania province of Germany. Polish border guards immediately opened fire, and the German sentries quickly retreated back into German territory. (2) A group of Germans opened fire on Polish sentries near Biolut and Danarski late on the 27th. (3) Two German sentries invaded Polish territory in the province of Posnania at midnight yesterday. (4) A large group of German soldiers invaded Polish territory near Leipzig late yesterday, destroying civilian houses with hand grenades before being repelled by Polish sentries. (5) A German plane from the Slovakian border twice invaded Polish airspace yesterday afternoon before turning back after being fired upon by Polish border guards with anti-aircraft guns.

<h3>Formation of the New Abe Cabinet in Japan; Abe Concurrently Holds the Foreign Minister Portfolio; Strong Bureaucratic Political Leaning</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) General Abe decided to include Mr. Nagai in the cabinet on the morning of the 30th, thus completing the cabinet formation process. After completing the procedures at noon on the same day, he entered the Imperial Palace to meet with His Majesty the Emperor, presented the list of cabinet members, and held an appointment ceremony. The new cabinet will start with a small number of cabinet members, with the three portfolios of Agriculture and Forestry, Health and Welfare, and Railways held concurrently. As much as possible, dedicated ministers will not be appointed. The Foreign Minister position will be filled by a dedicated minister at an appropriate time. According to the new cabinet's policy, internal councillors and parliamentary vice-ministers of various ministries will remain in place, but ministers without portfolio will not be appointed for the time being unless necessary. The list of cabinet members is as follows: Prime Minister Abe Nobuyuki (Military Councillor, Army General); Foreign Minister (held concurrently by the Prime Minister); Home Minister Obara Nao (former Minister of Justice); Finance Minister Aoki Kazuo (President of the Planning Board); Army Minister Hata Shunroku (Chief Aide-de-Camp, Army General); Navy Minister Yoshida Zengo (Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Navy Vice Admiral); Justice Minister Miyagi Chogoro (Chief Prosecutor of the Nagoya High Court); Education Minister Kawarada Kakichi (former Home Minister); Commerce and Industry Minister Godo Takuo (former Minister of Commerce); Agriculture and Forestry Minister (held concurrently by the Commerce and Industry Minister); Communications Minister Nagai Ryutaro (former Communications Minister); Railway Minister (held concurrently by the Communications Minister); Colonial Affairs Minister Kanemitsu Yoneo (Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives); Health and Welfare Minister (held concurrently by the Home Minister); Chief Cabinet Secretary Endo Ryusaku; President of the Planning Board (held concurrently by Finance Minister Aoki); Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Karasawa Toshiki (former Chief of the Security Bureau). (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Appointment Ceremony Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the appointment ceremony on the afternoon of the 30th, the Abe Cabinet convened its first cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at around 5:00 PM to formally decide on personnel matters such as the Chief Cabinet Secretary and the Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, and to exchange views on the policy direction of the new cabinet. After the meeting, the Prime Minister will meet with a group of reporters to explain the fundamental policies and political direction of the new cabinet regarding domestic and foreign affairs. In addition, the Prime Minister also plans to deliver a radio address to the nation around 7:00 PM as his first statement as Prime Minister. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Prime Minister, General Abe, entered the Imperial Palace at 1:10 PM on the 30th to report on the progress of cabinet formation and the selection of cabinet members. At 2:30 PM, the Emperor bestowed the imperial rescript appointing him as Prime Minister. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The official announcement was made on the night of the 29th that Horie Sueo, the secretary of the Privy Council and appraiser of the Administrative Court of the Privy Council, and secretary to the President of the Privy Council, was appointed as Chief Secretary of the Privy Council. (Domei dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Abe Delivers a Statement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Abe delivered a statement at 9:05 PM today, the content of which is as follows: "The world is currently in a turbulent state, and the situation is extremely serious. However, establishing a new order in East Asia is Japan's unwavering national policy, and adjusting international relations is also a matter of current importance. Given the complexity of the international situation, Japan will adhere to its independent stance and implement its beliefs autonomously. Countries that understand Japan's position and are willing to cooperate will be regarded as our friendly nations, and we will cooperate together. For countries that do not, we will deal with them with resolute determination. At the same time, domestically, we will renew institutions, strengthen the national defense system, enrich military preparations, and implement rational measures such as expanding production, promoting exports, and controlling the economy to overcome the current difficulties. Japan's policy towards the China Incident remains firm and unwavering. The government intends to work with the people to implement this policy and move towards a glorious goal. In short, the government will implement all kinds of administrative affairs with a clear and open spirit, guide national thought, and hope that all citizens will unite and support the government to complete the established national policy." (Domei dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Aoki Expresses Political Views</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Aoki delivered a statement at the Finance Minister's official residence, the main points of which are as follows: "Recently, international relations among major countries in the world have been constantly changing, and Japan's financial economy may also be affected. We believe that Japan's financial and economic policy should be based on dealing with the China Incident and the international situation, and strengthening Japan's national defense economy and other fundamental national power as the fundamental policy. To realize this fundamental policy, it is essential to expand the productive forces of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, utilize funds and materials, and strengthen the national mobilization system. The budget formulation policy for the 15th year of Showa will continue to follow the policy of the previous cabinet, with the aim of achieving the goals of the China Incident and building a new order in East Asia as the central policy." (Domei dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Offer Little Praise</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers are not giving much praise to the cabinet formed by the new Prime Minister Abe Nobuyuki. The Asahi Shimbun described the new cabinet as "mediocre and lacking vitality," because the Prime Minister has no connection with politics and no contact with the military, having retired three years ago. The only outstanding choice is the new Navy Minister Yoshida Zengo. The new Army Minister, Hata Shunroku, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in Central China, does not represent the progressive elements of the military. It is said that the new cabinet has a strong bureaucratic political nature, with Nagai Ryutaro, a member of the Minseito party, being the only member of a political party. The chairman of the Minseito party does not approve of his appointment as Communications Minister. Japanese newspapers support the Prime Minister's decision to abolish the cabinet system, which seemed to have caused friction among the five ministers and other cabinet members in the Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets. At the same time, the newspapers are concerned that, since the "China Incident," the economic and other plans adopted by various administrative ministries have become extremely complex, and they fear that concurrent positions among cabinet members will cause serious difficulties. It is said that the diplomatic community is dissatisfied with the Prime Minister's concurrent position as Foreign Minister, because Japan's diplomatic relations are very delicate and extremely important at this time. Godo Takuo's appointment as Minister of Commerce and Industry may be successful, but his concurrent position as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry is questionable, especially when the issues of food and rising prices are urgent, as the views of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry are often contradictory on these matters. The newspapers predict that the Finance Minister will follow the policies of his predecessors. The Chugai Commercial News commented on the new cabinet, saying that its policies are still unknown. Now that the plan to strengthen the anti-Comintern axis has been abolished, and Japan is being forced to redefine its diplomacy with Europe, the new cabinet should build a new stove from a completely new perspective in its foreign policy, and the claim that it is relying on foreign countries cannot be approved. The Prime Minister, who also serves as Foreign Minister, should cooperate with foreign countries that sympathize with and understand Japan's mission, "namely, establishing a new order in East Asia," and are willing to cooperate with Japan. The Kokumin Shimbun expressed satisfaction that the cabinet members of the previous cabinet are no longer serving in the new cabinet, but expressed concern about the policies followed by the new cabinet, especially foreign policy. The newspaper mentioned the rumor that Shigemitsu Mamoru, the ambassador to the United Kingdom, will be appointed as Foreign Minister, saying that the goal of Japanese diplomacy must be to break British dominance in East Asia and establish a new order in East Asia. This guiding principle should not be affected by the new international situation caused by the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. The newspaper is quite concerned about the possibility of a reconciliation between the United Kingdom and Japan rumored in Europe and the United States, saying that if the new cabinet compromises with the United Kingdom and hinders the establishment of a new order in East Asia, it would be a national misfortune. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from here today, the political power of the Abe Cabinet in Japan does not seem to be a problem. The key is whether it can smoothly promote the wartime economic and financial plan. Judging from the personnel selection of the Abe Cabinet, although it cannot be said to be a strong cabinet, there will be no major friction internally. In terms of economy, there will probably be no major changes. In other words, it must still concentrate its efforts in accordance with the original principles to seek the continuation of the war. The financial community welcomes Aoki Kazuo's appointment as Finance Minister, because his financial policies are similar to those of the former Finance Ministers Kaya and Ishiwata. It is said that the important issue of the new Ministry of Finance is the implementation of the new tax plan. (Associated Press dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of International Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(New York) The New York Sun published an editorial today, saying, "The new Japanese cabinet will be isolated until it gains the trust of the United Kingdom and the United States," and said that the new Japanese cabinet will encounter major difficulties because Prime Minister Abe is taking on important political responsibilities in a non-political attitude. Moreover, since German leader Hitler has betrayed Japan by signing the Soviet-German public agreement, the blow to Japan "cannot be compensated by any cabinet." (Associated Press dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, newspapers here have added lengthy commentaries, and unanimously believe that Japanese diplomacy has reached a dead end. The change of the cabinet is not enough to save the desperate situation. The Central Daily News claimed that the collapse of the Hiranuma cabinet was inevitable, because it publicly aimed to enhance the anti-Comintern pact at the beginning of its formation. Now that Germany and the Soviet Union have signed a treaty, the cabinet must fall. The emergence of this tragedy in Japan is due to the lack of politicians with foresight. The Ta Kung Pao insisted that General Abe's attempt to win over the United Kingdom will inevitably fail, because as long as Japan wants to establish a new order in East Asia, the rights and interests of the United Kingdom and the United States will be destroyed, and the Nine-Power Treaty will be broken one day. The English-language "Chu Pao" stated that it is strange that the first victim of the European crisis was found in Asia, because the evolution of the European situation forced the resignation of the Japanese cabinet. The report pointed out that since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, three short-lived Japanese cabinets have encountered policy failures one after another. If General Abe Nobuyuki does not have a fundamental solution to the Chinese conflict, his failure can be expected. (Haitong dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hong Kong's Chinese newspapers all commented on the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, believing that the collapse of the Hiranuma cabinet was directly affected by the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. In the future, the new cabinet will try to be pro-British in order to compensate for the loss of the anti-Comintern axis, and try to extricate itself from the quagmire of the invasion of China. In conclusion, the Ta Kung Pao said that any major international changes will not affect China's war of resistance against Japan. The change of the Japanese cabinet is naturally not worth paying attention to. No matter who takes office, China will always resist Japan to the end if Japan does not give up its aggression. If Japan does not know repentance, it will not be able to get rid of its deep-seated feet even if it replaces the cabinet hundreds of times. (Dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>US State Department Cares About the Situation in the Far East; Meets with Yarnell, etc.</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull is still closely monitoring the evolution of the situation in the Far East.

<h3>Roosevelt Talks Again About the Neutrality Act; The Attitude of Members of Congress</h3>
<p>(Washington) Morning newspapers published news that some Republican members of Congress are about to change their attitude towards the current Neutrality Act. President Roosevelt recently told the press that this statement has not been confirmed, but it is claimed that some Republican and Democratic members of Congress who previously voted against amending the Neutrality Act were closely watched by a certain European government, which shows how the attitude of American members of Congress has a profound impact on the international situation. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3>The United Kingdom is Prepared for All Eventualities; Determined to Resist Violence; Chamberlain's Strong Statement is Unanimously Supported by All Parties</h3>
<p>(London) Today's House of Commons once again had a solemn expression of unity. After listening to Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, the leaders of the Labour Party and the Liberal Party opposition all spoke in support of the government's firm stance in the current crisis. Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Greenwood said, "I would like to say in the most practical terms that aggression must end now. (Cheers) Poland must not follow the countries that have been victims of aggressors into the tomb. Our spirit has not weakened, but has increased. We hope and pray that we can avoid great destruction. If not, the responsibility will be borne by one person. War will not occur unless Hitler is willing to wage war. The Labour Party is determined to defend freedom and maintain law and order to resist those who arbitrarily use force. Our determination, in a nutshell, is that the threat of open aggression should be ended. We are bold and unshakable on this matter. Those who do not respect the quality of words repeatedly agreed upon will be traitors to world peace and freedom."</p>
<p>Liberal Party leader Sinclair rose to speak, saying, "We cannot move from 'crisis to another crisis. This must be stopped. The government should now receive the firm support of Congress and all peace-loving people in Great Britain. Now the final word will be issued by Hitler." Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax spoke in the Upper House, his words being largely the same as those expressed by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the Lower House. Thus, Congress adjourned until Tuesday of next week.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons today was calm and firm, and it was enough to excite people. The Prime Minister spoke in a warm cheer and said, "The world often says that the English people's determination is slow, but once the English people's will is determined, they will never let it go. Now that peace and war are still uncertain, our determination to adhere to the predetermined course will not be slackened in the slightest." The Prime Minister then praised the extraordinary calmness shown by the entire British people during this period of anticipation. The Prime Minister then mentioned the preparations for national defense, saying that he admitted that the various plans on micro-issuance would cause various inconveniences, but he believed that the people must now unanimously recognize that the needs of the country are now higher than everything else. "We have not yet begun to issue rations here. Britain's air defense is now in a state of immediate action. Ground air defense arrangements have been garrisoned. The standing team of the Royal Air Force has reached wartime strength after adding necessary reserves. Barrage balloon teams have been assigned to their respective defenses. Reconnaissance teams have been stationed in their defensive positions. The alarm system is ready to operate day and night. (Cheers) The defenses of the bay have been fully arranged, and important locations are garrisoned. A large number of troops have been mobilized at home and abroad. This mobilization is part of a pre-planned plan, so the teams should be sent to their respective defenses as soon as possible before the outbreak of war. As soon as local permanent agencies receive notification, they will be able to move schoolchildren, mothers with infants, pregnant mothers, and blind people from densely populated areas to safe locations. Hospitals for the wounded are also being set up. All of this is enough to show that the country is prepared for all eventualities. (Cheers) The Prime Minister's speech lasted sixteen minutes." (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Washington: The British government's reply to Germany's note and the latest news from Europe have been carefully studied by people close to the White House and the State Department. It is generally believed that the British and French governments will be able to maintain a calm and firm attitude. The reports in American newspapers that the United Kingdom intends to make concessions to Germany and maintain peace at any cost are influenced by the German propaganda campaign and are not true. In short, the current situation has been clearly expressed by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in his speech in the House of Commons. In other words, the key to peace and war depends entirely on how Germany responds to the British letter. Leader Hitler may agree to continue talks, but this does not mean giving up any of the original goals. It is speculated that the Leader wants to extend the "nerve war," so the current crisis is unlikely to be completely resolved for a while. Germany may seek to establish a temporary compromise solution and wait for an appropriate opportunity to take "offensive" action again. In fact, Britain and France will certainly not allow it to get its wish. In addition, the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet has not yet discussed the ratification of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. The effects of the establishment have disappeared, and this is also quite important. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>France Striving for Self-Defense; Increased Alertness; Prohibition of Public Gatherings; Foreigners Enlisting in the Army One After Another</h3>
<p>(Paris) Reserve soldiers of the French "Blue Card" class have already enlisted. After the "Red Card" class of strong men enlist, the national mobilization will begin to be realized. French Prime Minister Daladier yesterday discussed military defense matters with General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff of National Defense. Daladier then met with former Prime Minister Blum, who expressed the support of the Socialist Party members for the government. According to the police authorities, the strength of the party has greatly increased since it separated from the Communists. According to the police authorities, 150 Communist organizations and printing offices in the suburbs of Paris were thoroughly searched, and as a result, 3,000 slogans and 90,000 propaganda pamphlets were seized. The government authorities claimed that all political gatherings would be strictly prohibited in the future. Officials here believe that the government's actions are the result of France's increasingly cordial diplomatic relations with Spain. Also, official inspections of telegrams and telephones have now been slightly relaxed, but inspection work is still ongoing. (Associated Press dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government has issued orders that no public gatherings may be held in the urban area and suburbs. If anyone violates the prohibition and holds meetings in wine shops and coffee shops, they will be closed. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreigners of various nationalities are now enlisting rapidly in the French army to defend France, just as they enlisted in the French army during World War I. The steps to form an American Legion are now underway. It is said that there are 10,000 Americans who have expressed their desire to enlist. Polish residents and Polish Jews in France who participated in the Great War have declared that they intend to serve France on the battlefield. The "French Friends of Hungary Federation" said that most of its members have enlisted to protect France. Hundreds of Italians residing in France have also volunteered to help France in the war. At the same time, the authorities have taken more advanced security plans, such as prohibiting telephone calls abroad and sending encrypted telegrams. Telegrams sent abroad must now obtain a signature, and domestic calls subject to military inspection can only be conducted in French. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Submarine Incident Reinforces Western Border Defenses; German-Soviet Pact Delay in Ratification: A Powerful Factor for Peace</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Recently, multiple foreign newspapers, such as the Swiss "Neue Zürcher Zeitung," have repeatedly carried reports claiming that the Soviet military has withdrawn 200,000 to 300,000 troops from the western border and transferred them to the eastern border to strengthen defenses. TASS was previously instructed to declare that the above report was completely inconsistent with the facts. According to relevant sources, the Soviet military believes that the situation in Eastern Europe is serious and unexpected events may occur, and has decided to increase the troop strength of the western border defense forces. (TASS dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Communist Party's organ, Pravda, recently published an article commenting on the international situation, stating that the Soviet Union is deeply aware of the threat of war and is extremely vigilant, and is therefore busy strengthening the Red Army's strength. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to news here today, the Soviet Union is putting pressure on Germany to join peace negotiations to resolve the Polish-German crisis. The Soviet Union views the Soviet parliament's delay in ratifying the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact as a threat to Germany, stating that if Germany attacks Poland, the pact will be torn up. Sources here in the Soviet Union claim that if Germany invades Poland in the near future, it will give the Supreme Soviet the opportunity to oppose the ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, thereby nullifying the pact. Moscow's announcement of the Soviet Union's strengthening of its western border garrison is seen as another form of pressure on Germany to oppose aggression and protect Poland and the Balkan Peninsula countries. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After receiving news that the Soviet Supreme Soviet would postpone ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty and other news, official circles here all hope that the Soviet Union will still contribute to limiting aggression. Although relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were extremely shaken when this agreement was signed, current official opinion is that the actual situation is not as bad as imagined. Anti-Soviet movements in American newspapers have inevitably been launched prematurely. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Supreme Soviet has not yet submitted the ratification of the German-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty for discussion after yesterday's meeting. Foreigners here believe that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov originally planned to deliver a speech in the parliament on the day of the treaty's ratification, explaining Soviet foreign policy. The delay in discussing the case shows that the government intends to wait and see how the international situation develops. In other words, the Supreme Soviet's delay in discussing the ratification is actually what the Soviet government wants, and it is by no means accidental. Since the Supreme Soviet's meeting, it unanimously passed the agricultural tax bill today. Tomorrow is a Soviet holiday and the meeting will be adjourned for one day. When the meeting resumes at 1:00 p.m. on the 31st, the new conscription bill will be submitted for discussion. Assuming that this bill can be voted on and passed on a regular day, the ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty will have to wait until at least the first day of next month before it can be discussed. Moreover, the government convened the Supreme Soviet meeting in a hurry, and most of the deputies from the outer provinces were unable to reach the meeting on time yesterday. Therefore, when the Supreme Soviet discussed the agricultural tax bill yesterday, there were many empty seats in the chamber, which looked quite deserted. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Psychological Warfare Enters a New Stage</h3>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources here recently declared that the current "psychological warfare" in Europe seems to be entering a new stage today. So far, there are no signs of concession to the various demands made by Germany, nor has it agreed to negotiate with Poland first in the hope of implementing its demands. Although the tone of German newspapers has softened slightly and the diplomatic efforts of various related countries can be regarded as good omens, German troops have already concentrated in the state of Slovakia, which is far from the city of Danzig. It can be seen that Danzig has, in fact, already threatened Poland's Upper Silesia province. In addition, most members of Ukrainian nationalist parties in the Carpathian Ukraine province (formerly belonging to Czechoslovakia and now owned by Hungary) are said to have returned to the province with German passports to promote the Greater Ukraine movement (there are many Ukrainians within Poland). All of this proves that the situation is still extremely chaotic. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>China Cultural and Educational Center to Broadcast to England Today; English Script Drafted; Plea for Firm Stance Against Japan</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news here today, the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center here will broadcast to England tomorrow, requesting that England take a firm stance against Japan. The English script for the broadcast has now been drafted, the gist of which is that the arrogant and domineering attitude of Japanese soldiers towards England is entirely the result of England's consistent policy of mildness and weakness towards Japan. The article believes that Chamberlain's claim that England is facing serious threats in Europe and therefore cannot but adopt a policy of appeasement towards Japan in the Far East is completely a pretext to shirk responsibility. England is the most powerful country in the world, and its national strength exceeds the sum of Germany and Italy. At the same time, the United States and France are willing to cooperate and resist aggression, so what is there to fear? Moreover, the United States' announcement of the abolition of the trade treaty with Japan and the Soviet Union's constant attacks on the border of "Manchukuo" are all clear proof that there is no need to fear Japan. However, as of now, the British government has taken no concrete action other than continuing to submit to Japan. It is no wonder that Chamberlain still says that there are no disputes between countries that cannot be resolved peacefully and must resort to force. The Munich Agreement was the result of Chamberlain's appeasement policy. When this agreement was signed, Chamberlain originally hoped to turn hostility into friendship, but has this been successful in reality? The script also stated that Chamberlain, surrounded by a small number of financiers in London, would rather encourage the fascist warlords and sacrifice democratic and weak countries, while allowing his compatriots in China to suffer all kinds of insults from the Japanese, and allowing his interests of more than a hundred years to be squeezed out by the Japanese. At the beginning of the Sino-British conference, a preliminary agreement was reached, and then the four suspects were willing to submit to the puppet organization. There is now a rumor that the British side is planning to hand over the Chinese silver in the British concession in Tianjin to the Japanese side. All these actions are not only obviously unfavorable to China, but also sufficient to fuel the anti-British movement by the Japanese in China. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Committee for Collecting Winter Clothing Formulates This Year's Collection Plan; Aim to Collect Three Million Cotton Vests Within Two Months; Work to Begin Simultaneously in All Regions on September 1st</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The National Winter Clothing Collection Movement Committee has formulated the collection plan for the 28th year, with the aim of starting work simultaneously in all regions from September 1st and collecting three million cotton vests within two months to distribute to the soldiers fighting in the war. Old clothes will also be collected and distributed to refugees. The National Winter Clothing Collection Association will be the coordinating organization, and the various branches and offices will be the implementing agencies for collection, sewing, and distribution. The number of items to be contributed will be determined according to the economic conditions of each province and city, with Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Chongqing each contributing 200,000 items; Fujian 150,000 items; Hubei, Jiangxi, Xikang, Henan, and Gansu each contributing 100,000 items; and Zhejiang, Anhui, and Qinghai each contributing 50,000 items, totaling three million items. Due to transportation issues, the Nanyang, Shanghai, and Hong Kong areas will be limited to raising funds. The number of funds to be contributed has also been stipulated, with Nanyang and overseas areas contributing one million yuan, Shanghai 200,000 yuan, and Hong Kong 100,000 yuan. Based on past experience and current transportation conditions, after the funds are raised in various regions, suitable locations with convenient transportation and sufficient materials and labor will be selected in each province and city for sewing and distribution. One cotton vest will be valued at 1.5 yuan in national currency. After the vests are made, they can be directly distributed by each province and city to the troops, new recruits, wounded soldiers, and sick soldiers in their respective provinces and cities or neighboring provinces and cities. However, before distribution, the number and the troop number to which they are being distributed must be notified to the association so that the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Political Department can plan as a whole to avoid duplication. If sewing is impossible due to difficulties in purchasing materials or transportation inconveniences, the collected funds can be remitted to the association for manufacturing and distribution. In addition, Xi'an, Yichang, Chongqing, Guilin, and Ji'an will be the five locations for the concentration and distribution of cotton vests. All provincial branches, except those that distribute directly, will concentrate on these five major manufacturing and distribution locations. The funds remitted by each province to the association will also be distributed to the respective manufacturing locations to continue sewing. In terms of old clothes, regardless of size or length, all will be collected. Cash donations in lieu of clothing are also welcome and can be handed over to the Central Relief Committee or local relief agencies for collection and distribution. Those without affiliated agencies of the Relief Committee can still ask the Winter Clothing Collection Association and its branches to collect and forward them. The materials for cotton vests should be mainly sturdy and durable coarse cloth that does not shine. Gray is the preferred color, but black, blue, tea, and green are also acceptable. Each item should be limited to seven taels of cotton or coarse wool. Leather items can be used in place of cotton and wool in the Northwest. (Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese consul here lodged a protest yesterday with the British consul-general in Tianjin, Jameson.

We pray that victory belongs to us, and we must resist all provocative actions, whether peaceful or non-peaceful. As for the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, Germany believes that this move will greatly embarrass the countries on the peace front. This intention has actually made a big mistake in psychology, because the countries that were panicked by this move were not the countries on the peace front, but Germany's friendly countries and allies." In conclusion, he said, "In any case, we cannot merely seek to prolong our lives under the threat of a gun." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Washington) After the "North German Lloyd Company" mail ship "Bremen" was detained by the New York Port Authority, the company claimed that the German Embassy in the United States had lodged a protest with the State Department. Regarding this matter, President Roosevelt made a statement to reporters, stating that in addition to the "Bremen," other foreign ships anchored in American ports have also been detained for inspection. The purpose of this move is to determine whether these ships can be equipped with weapons for offensive use in wartime, and there is no unusual significance. All ships of countries that may become belligerents must be inspected. In short, if merchant ships of various countries are equipped with weapons for defensive purposes only, they can be allowed to anchor in American ports. However, if there is reason to believe that these armed merchant ships can attack other countries' merchant ships on the high seas, they should be detained to relieve the United States of its responsibility for harboring them.

<h3>British and Japanese Troops Briefly Clashed in Shenzhen: Dozens of Casualties on Both Sides; Secret Negotiations Underway; Strict Security Measures in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: After the Japanese army reoccupied Shenzhen, there was talk of blockading Hong Kong, so the situation on the Sino-British border suddenly became serious. On the 23rd, four Japanese transport ships sailed to Chiwan waters close to Hong Kong and anchored, carrying about a thousand cavalry and three thousand infantry. After landing in Nantou, they went to Shenzhen and Shatoujiao, tightly surrounding the northern part of Hong Kong's Kowloon New Territories. On the same day, another forty to fifty Japanese gunboats, cruisers, and armed fishing boats gathered in the waters outside Kap Shui Mun and Lei Yue Mun, less than five miles from British territorial waters. The Hong Kong authorities, seeing the Japanese army and navy gathering on the Sino-British border, expected some intention and, with news of the tense situation in Europe also reaching Hong Kong, issued an emergency order to transfer British and Indian troops to the New Territories for defense, to prevent invasion. A solid trench was built from the south bank of the Shenzhen River through Fanling to Shatoujiao. The railway bridge connecting Luohu Station and Shenzhen and the highway bridges connecting Man Kam To in the New Territories to Shatoujiao via Sheung Shui were all blown up with explosives, cutting off traffic on the Sino-British border. Landmines were also buried at strategic points, actively preparing for war. Transportation vehicles, troop carriers, artillery carriers, and material carriers in Kowloon traveled back and forth all day. All British engineering personnel and electrical engineering personnel in Hong Kong were summoned and sent to the New Territories to provide services, setting up military telephones and defensive electrical grids, their work being extraordinarily busy.</p>
<p>One Hour of Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after dusk on the 23rd, a squadron of about a hundred Japanese cavalry suddenly charged into the British-controlled Man Kam To highway and opened fire as a demonstration. At that time, British and Indian troops were busy deploying defenses on the front. Suddenly seeing Japanese cavalry charging into the defense line, they immediately returned fire to stop them. The sentries of the British and Japanese armies clashed, and fierce fighting lasted for about an hour. The sounds of machine guns and artillery rumbled incessantly, audible to residents in Sham Shui Po and Kowloon. Later, a large force of British infantry advanced from Shatin and Tai Po to reinforce the front, eventually repelling the Japanese cavalry. In this battle, eighteen British soldiers and over thirty Indian soldiers were injured or killed. The number of Japanese soldiers injured or killed was also equal. The Hong Kong military authorities, upon receiving reports of the frontline clash, immediately used the telephone to sternly question the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong and telegraphed the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Shenzhen to prevent the escalation of the situation. Therefore, after about an hour of fierce fighting, the frontline sentries of both sides ceased fire. That night, security on the Sino-British border was extremely strict. Sanitary teams and ambulances traveled to the New Territories all night, transporting wounded soldiers back to Hong Kong. Troop carriers were again busy on the road, and residents throughout Hong Kong were even more shocked. After this incident, the military authorities of both Britain and Japan were unwilling to escalate the situation and prohibited the spread of such news. The authorities of both sides are currently engaged in secret negotiations, intending to resolve the matter through diplomatic means.</p>
<p>British Women and Children Leave Hong Kong</p>
<p>On the 24th, the Hong Kong Air Defense Department convened an emergency meeting to discuss the zonal deployment of air defenses. All Hong Kong police and reserve police were also ordered to assemble and distribute work. From that day on, there was a general mobilization to maintain local security. Off-duty police officers were not allowed to leave their posts for more than two hours without reason, and others were assigned to guard, fire, rescue, and various other tasks. British women and children originally residing in Fanling, Sheung Shui, Luohu, and Tai Po, and in areas closer to the front line in the New Territories, were all required to return to Hong Kong or Kowloon, or were advised to voluntarily evacuate back to their home countries or go to the Philippines. Therefore, British people taking ships to leave Hong Kong continued one after another. The reporter saw a British woman with three children about ten years old in a furniture store on the main street, buying several suitcases. When the shop owner asked what they were for, the woman said she was packing her luggage to evacuate back to her home country, adding that her property, accumulated through more than twenty years of hard work, was all in the New Territories. It was worrying to have to abandon it and leave. As she spoke, she sobbed and wept, looking very sad.</p>
<p>Mines Placed in Harbor</p>
<p>The day after the clash between British and Japanese troops, the British Navy also ordered the partial blockade of the harbor and the deployment of mines. Dangerous objects were first laid in the waters off Lei Yue Mun and Cape Collinson on the eastern side of Hong Kong. The Marine Department notified ships leaving the harbor that they must pass more than 3,000 feet away from the Cape Collinson lighthouse to avoid danger. At night, small boats were anchored at the eastern end of the blockade line, displaying two red lights as a signal to indicate the shipping lane. The Hong Kong army and navy have close communication and deployment, so defense can be guaranteed. It is also heard that a large number of land, sea, and air forces from Singapore will arrive in Hong Kong soon to assist in defense, so the people are quite calm.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces are Weak</p>
<p>According to a military spokesperson, the tense defense deployment in Hong Kong was influenced by the situation in Europe, not by the Japanese army's pressure on the New Territories. He also said that the Japanese army's strength was very weak, at most only ten thousand or so people. The local land, sea, and air forces are far superior to the Japanese army, and their quality is several times better than the Japanese army. Furthermore, Japan is being restrained by the Chinese army, so it has no ability to attack Hong Kong. Only because of the drastic changes in the European situation, and for the sake of preparedness, it is necessary to gather military strength and make strict deployments to prevent any eventuality. According to sources, the Japanese army's plan to threaten Hong Kong was before Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression treaty. Unexpectedly, during the troop movements, news of the signing of the German-Soviet treaty suddenly arrived, and Japan's plan against Britain suffered a major blow. In this changing new situation, Japan would certainly not threaten Britain too much. There are about two reasons for this pressure on Hong Kong: (1) The Japanese army's threat to Hong Kong is deliberately creating a serious situation to make Britain aware of the difficulty of taking care of the Far East and to promote compromise between Britain and Japan; (2) Although negotiations in Tokyo have stalled, Japan also does not want a breakdown, so it is using this to promote the resumption of Anglo-Japanese negotiations, hoping for British concessions to resolve all issues. Now that the British authorities have determined that the Japanese army is unable to put pressure on Hong Kong, there is no possibility of expanding the conflict between Britain and Japan in the Far East. However, the impact of the situation in the Far East also depends on how the war in Europe develops.</p>
<h3>British Missionary in Suzhou Inspected by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>British and American Goods All Banned from Sale</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: Under the guidance of the Japanese army, the puppet organization in Suzhou held an anti-British movement, and recently implemented a boycott of British goods. The organizers are the Suzhou Special Service Agency on the Japanese side and the Puppet Greater People's Association and the Puppet County Government on the puppet side. Starting with the shops, all British-made cigarettes, woolens, medicines, etc., were stamped with seals and sealed, and they were not allowed to be sold. The Japanese soldiers at each city gate also inspected British goods and strictly inspected pedestrians entering and leaving the city. Anyone found by the Japanese army to be carrying British-made goods would be severely slapped and have all items confiscated. On the 23rd, two British missionaries, a man and a woman, passed through the Chang Gate, intending to enter the city. They were stopped by Japanese sentries who asked them their nationality. Knowing that they were British, they punched them in the chest. The British woman next to him argued with them, and the Japanese soldier pointed a bayonet at her and ordered them to take out all the money and belongings on them for inspection. The British man had no choice but to let the Japanese soldier touch him randomly. After ten minutes, the Japanese soldier waved his hand to let them enter the city. As for the British woman, she was inspected by a Chinese puppet female police officer.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Movements in Yangzhou: Internal Conflicts Among Officers; Espionage Activities</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Dispatch: Gui Wulang, the head of the Japanese army's special task force in Yangzhou, was transferred to Nanjing this time because of differences with the head of the military police, Tsuchiya, and mutual attacks. Currently, the Japanese side in Nanjing has also transferred Tsuchiya back.</p>
<p>Because the Japanese army in Yangzhou has been frequently attacked by guerrillas in various places, suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese and puppet troops in Yangzhou have been repeatedly transferred to various places to reinforce them, causing the residents to be quite alarmed. The Japanese side is also afraid that the people will move away, so they have specially sent a large number of puppets to handle the five-household joint guarantee system, not allowing people to move.</p>
<p>Recently, about two hundred Japanese and Taiwanese ruffians have arrived in Yangzhou, all of whom can speak the dialects of Shanghai, Beiping, Qingjiang, Huaiyang, Zhenjiang, and other places, specializing in probing Chinese military intelligence. These spies have dark skin and all wear Chinese casual clothes, looking like Chinese farmers on the outside. They will soon be assigned to work in various places, with three people in a group. Each group will be joined by a local Chinese traitor.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Maintains Credit: National Salvation Bonds to Pay Interest Today; Payment in Cash or Remittance Pending Telegraphic Instructions; Simultaneously Discounting and Paying the Rejuvenation Bonds</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's unwavering commitment to maintaining credit: The National Salvation Bonds due at the end of August have been allocated from the national treasury's tax revenue and are scheduled to be paid by the Central Bank starting today. The seventh tranche of principal and interest of the Rejuvenation Bonds will be discounted by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, with payments starting simultaneously. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>National Salvation Bonds to Start Paying Interest</p>
<p>The total amount of National Salvation Bonds issued is 500 million National currency. The second payment of interest is 20 million National currency. According to regulations, it is due on August 31st. After the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank telegraphed the head office in Chongqing for instructions, it received a reply from the head office the night before last, approving payment on schedule. The interest payment has been allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury's tax revenue. The branch bank telegraphed the head office in Chongqing again yesterday morning, asking whether the Shanghai branch should pay in cash or by remittance, as the reply did not specify. As of last night, no reply had been received. It is expected that a reply will be received this morning, and action will be taken accordingly. According to financial experts, Shanghai will pay by remittance.</p>
<p>Rejuvenation Bonds to be Paid by Remittance</p>
<p>The seventh tranche of principal and interest of the 1936 Rejuvenation Bonds, totaling 1.1594 million National currency, including 1.7 million yuan in principal and 9.8944 million yuan in interest, will be discounted and paid by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has been notified by the head office to discount and pay the bonds starting today, through the branch and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications. The payment will be made in six installments and by remittance. However, bondholders must fill out an application for discounting customs-guaranteed domestic debt principal and interest. The fund is guaranteed by customs duties. Now, because customs duties in the occupied areas have been intercepted, the Ministry of Finance has been forced to temporarily suspend the payment of principal and interest. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has negotiated with the four banks to agree to discount and pay the bonds.</p>
<p>Unified Gold Bond to be Drawn on Schedule</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from silver firms yesterday that the National Debt Fund Management Committee has scheduled the drawing of the eighth tranche of the Class B bonds of the 1936 Unified Public Bonds, the twelfth tranche of the 1928 Financial Long-Term Public Bonds, the 16th tranche of the 1931 Telecommunications Public Bonds, the seventh tranche of the 1937 Financial Consolidation of Guangdong Public Bonds, and the sixth tranche of the 1937 Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project US Dollar Bonds at 10:00 AM on September 9th. The committee has sent letters to the Chamber of Commerce, the Silver Firms Association, the First Special District Court, the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications, inviting them to send representatives to supervise the lottery at the time. Regarding the repayment of principal and interest of the 1928 Financial Long-Term Public Bonds, it is heard that the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank have agreed to discount and pay the bonds.</p>

<h3>Sino-Foreign Charity Association Initiates Relief for Tianjin Disaster</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Sino-Foreign Charity Association at 97 Renji Road in this city, the lives of residents in the Tianjin concession have been extremely difficult since it was blockaded. Unexpectedly, troubles never come singly. The river suddenly rose, and Tianjin became a waterlogged area. In the suburbs, people and animals were swept away, and the numbers were difficult to estimate. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are moving towards Beiping, Tanggu, and other places, supporting the old and carrying the young, in a miserable state. Moreover, due to the stagnant water in the disaster area, there are many cases of malaria, and cholera is rampant. The association received a telegram from Honorary President Sun Zhongying and an appeal from the Tianjin YMCA, and decided to appeal to all sectors at home and abroad for assistance in dealing with the Tianjin disaster, and will first transport a large batch of epidemic medicines to Tianjin for distribution to meet the urgent needs.</p>
<h3>British and Polish Diplomats Arrive in Shanghai Successively</h3>
<p>Rosset, the new Polish Chargé d'affaires (the French spelling, previously mistaken as Basituo), has reportedly been formally notified by the Polish government to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Mr. Rosset will arrive in Shanghai at the end of January and take office on February 1.</p>
<p>Mr. Cottrell, the Director General of the British Consulate General in Shanghai, left Shanghai in February for a short trip to Japan. It is now known that Mr. Cottrell and his wife returned from Japan on January 8.</p>
<h3>Tribute Rice Specially Approved for Exchange and Tax Exemption: Reducing the Burden on Civilians; Specifically Used for Price Stabilization and Refugee Food; Estimated Price About 20 Yuan Per Shi</h3>
<p>The National Government's Concern for People's Food is Inspiring</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, in view of the serious panic in Shanghai's food supply, in addition to the Refugee Relief Association and various groups ordering 18,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon to transport to Shanghai for refugee relief and price stabilization, also jointly requested the Executive Yuan and President Kong through Li Fusun and Xu Jiyu for foreign exchange of 10,000 pounds sterling, which has been approved by reply telegram and specially approved for tax-free import, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The 10,000 pounds of foreign exchange approved by the Executive Yuan, calculated according to the posted rate of seven pence by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, has already ordered 18,000 bags, each bag containing one stone and two and a half dou, totaling 22,500 shi, which has been loaded onto the Norwegian Hague Wheel in Saigon and has already set sail yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai on September 5 or 6. Among them, 10,000 bags were ordered by the Refugee Relief Association and will be distributed to various shelters as refugee food after arriving in Shanghai. The remaining 8,000 bags will be handed over to rice industry groups to be responsible for distributing them to various stores for price stabilization. The sales price and detailed methods will be decided separately at that time. In short, it is stipulated that rice shops, in addition to receiving a small agency fee, will sell at the original price, so as to reduce the burden on ordinary civilians. The number of 8,000 bags is not enough to distribute, but it will provide some assistance. We will continue to purchase in the future until the price of domestic rice is suppressed.</p>
<p>Price Approximately 20 Yuan Per Shi</p>
<p>Regarding the funds for ordering foreign rice, Yu Qiaqing, Li Fusun, and Xu Jiyu jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request the supply of foreign exchange, and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has replied by telegram approving the purchase of 10,000 pounds sterling according to the posted rate of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The current legal exchange rate is seven pence, while the black market foreign exchange is four pence, which is three pence more. Therefore, according to this calculation, the original estimate of more than 30 yuan was needed per shi of foreign rice; with the purchase of legal foreign exchange and approval for tax-free import, it can be lowered by one-third, that is, 20 legal currency. This is sufficient proof of the National Government's concern for the food supply of Shanghai citizens and reducing the suffering of the people. Its virtuous government and good intentions are truly inspiring.</p>
<p>Registration and Ordering Proceed as Usual</p>
<p>As for the registration for ordering foreign rice, as of the 28th, there were a total of 2,181 bags. The accountants who went to the Accountant's Association yesterday and the day before yesterday included the Shanghai Silk Industry Association (56 bags), Dazhong Company (50 bags), Qian Changxiang (50 bags), Dazhong Bank (50 bags), Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory (100 bags), and Qiantai Xiang Five Branches (50 bags), totaling 356 bags, for a total of 2,536 bags. Since the City Chamber of Commerce notified the various industry associations to order foreign rice, yesterday the various industry associations flocked to the chamber to collect registration forms, so it is said that each industry is registering in large quantities. According to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, as soon as enough orders are received to fill a ship with 20,000 bags, the purchase will be made and loaded onto a special ship for transport to Shanghai, but the exchange rate will not be the posted rate of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications.</p>
<p>Supply Exceeds Demand, Rice Prices Gradually Fall</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council negotiated with the Japanese side and obtained sympathy for unclogging sources, the source of domestic rice has gradually been unblocked. Although there has been no large influx in recent days, it has been able to be transported to Shanghai successively, and a large number is expected to be transported to Shanghai soon. Yesterday, only six ships arrived at the river, totaling 1,141 shi, due to the typhoon. A total of 21,738 bags were offered for sale in the rice market, but because the supply exceeded the demand, only about a thousand bags were sold. Prices continued to fall sharply. Indica rice fell by two yuan, with the highest price being 23 to 25 yuan. White japonica rice fell by three yuan, to 27 yuan, with the highest price being 31 yuan for a whole bag. The other grades of winter frost fragrant japonica rice were also weak and tired. This is sufficient evidence that people's hearts are stable and the panic over food rice seems to have gradually lessened. It is also heard that the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co. has purchased 10,000 bags of Indica rice from Wuhu and will ship them to Shanghai in batches for sale. With the special permission of Acting Chairman Han of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Indica rice from the Jiangbei area will be loaded onto ships from ports and other places and transported to Shanghai to supply food to the people in the concession.</p>
<h3>Editor of the Greater Shanghai Evening News, Zhu Xinggong, Assassinated; Died Tragically from Vital Wound; Suspect Apprehended</h3>
<p>Zhu Xinggong, also known as Misonglu, was a native of Lucheng, Dantu County, Jiangsu. He was 38 years old. He was upright, outspoken, and treated people with sincerity, which is rare in modern times. His wife, Ms. He, named Liying, shared a deep affection with him. They had one son, seven years old, who was just beginning his education. Zhu had a deep understanding and belief in classical literature and morality.</p>
<p>He had many writings and was respected by the cultural community. On the first day of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the American-owned Greater Shanghai Evening News hired Zhu to formally join the newspaper as an editor for the night edition because of his reputation. His residence was at 94 North Henan Road in the Public Concession. Because he lived frugally, he always walked instead of taking a car when going out. Yesterday at about 4:00 PM, Zhu walked out of his residence as usual and walked to the Greater Shanghai Evening News. Unexpectedly, while walking on North Henan Road near the Bund Building on Tiantong Road, he suddenly encountered</p>
<p>Three Assailants</p>
<p>who emerged from the roadside, approached Zhu, and blocked him. One of them took out a gun and shot Zhu. Zhu was unable to escape and was shot in the left temple, immediately falling to the ground and dying. The assailants fled as soon as their goal was achieved. Nearby police officers rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and searched for the perpetrators. At the same time, the Huidong Police Station, upon receiving the report, immediately sent Chinese Detectives Shang Shenbo and Zhu Mengwei to lead detectives to the scene to pursue the perpetrators. A suspect was apprehended on the spot and taken back to the police station for interrogation. The police immediately called an ambulance to rush Zhu to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was too late because the vital wound had already taken his life. Afterwards, the Greater Shanghai Evening News urgently notified Zhu's family and published an extra edition about Zhu's death. Zhu's wife</p>
<p>received the tragic news and almost fainted from grief. Fortunately, she was revived by others. She rushed to Renji with her young son, mourning over his body and crying uncontrollably. The child's cries were especially heartbreaking. Friends present could not help but shed tears of sympathy. Because Zhu's family was poor, all the funeral arrangements were handled jointly by the newspaper and Zhu's relatives and friends. Zhu's body was sent to the Jiaozhou Road morgue that night, awaiting</p>
<p>Court Inspection to be applied for tomorrow morning, and a coffin will be placed at the Dazhong Funeral Home at the end of Jiaozhou Road at 3:00 PM on September 1st, with white carts and white horses to express mourning and honor. It is also learned that Zhu had received many warning letters due to his professional duties before his death. The day before the incident, he received another letter. The reason for his death is still under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ships Ordered to Adopt Alert Plan; Will Sail Directly to Singapore Upon Receiving Orders; French, German, and Italian Ships Have Not Received Special News</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reported that British officials yesterday (29th) issued a secret order to British shipping companies in this area instructing them on the precautionary plans to be adopted by British ships in the Far East in the event of war. British naval officers stationed in Shanghai did not confirm the issuance of this order.</p>
<p>Taikoo and Jardine Matheson Have Received Secret Orders</p>
<p>However, it is heard that the four British companies, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, British American Tobacco, and Moller, have received the order, but it is of a strictly confidential nature, and detailed instructions have been given to the masters of each ship. It is generally believed that if Britain is drawn into the war, the British Admiralty, which has supreme control over British ships worldwide, will order merchant ships to report to the nearest British naval base. British ships in Chinese waters may sail directly to Singapore.</p>
<p>To be Requisitioned One Day to Carry Food</p>
<p>Yesterday, most shipping companies stated categorically that there had been no change in the routes of their ships currently on the high seas. All emergency actions will be taken separately and directly upon receiving orders from the Admiralty. It is widely believed that many of the ships that receive orders at that time will be used to transport food and raw materials to Europe to supply the Allied forces, but there will also be many ships that continue their current trade in East Asian waters.</p>
<p>Italian and British Officials Extremely Silent</p>
<p>Italian and British naval officials in Shanghai are extremely silent about the movements of their warships docked in Shanghai. The Italian troop transport ship Carlo Trotto, originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday, suddenly stopped sailing out. The British authorities have no knowledge of British ships arriving in or leaving Shanghai.</p>
<p>German Merchant Ships Have No New Developments</p>
<p>After German merchant ships in Eastern waters received orders from the government a few days ago to sail as quickly as possible to the nearest neutral port, no new developments have been reported from German shipping companies in this area. The North German Company's Xianghuosi Tuolun, which left Shanghai on the 21st of this month, sailed out of Manila a few days later, intending to go to Singapore, but suddenly returned and is still docked in Manila.</p>
<p>French Postal Ship Has Not Received Government Instructions</p>

Shanghai was spared a direct hit. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6 AM yesterday, the hurricane had reached 31.45 degrees north latitude and 122.30 degrees east longitude, with its center within a 30-nautical-mile radius. The direction had shifted to northwest or north-northwest, and the wind force remained fierce. Upon checking the reported location, it was over the Sheweishan waters off Tongsha, outside Wusongkou.

The direction officially shifted from northwest to north-northwest, and the wind force remained extremely fierce. Upon checking the reported location, the hurricane had advanced to the Yellow Sea, 200 nautical miles north of Shanghai, heading towards Qingdao. The Jianghai Customs immediately removed two black balls from the top of the building and at Wusongkou on Avenue Lanlu, indicating that the hurricane had passed Shanghai.</p>
<p>Huangpu River Ships to Resume Sailing Today</p>
<p>The customs black ball was removed at approximately 3 PM yesterday, and the warning was lifted. However, although the ships had received news that the hurricane had passed, it was too late to complete the departure procedures, so they had to remain suspended for another day. If the wind remains stable today, full service is expected to resume.</p>

It is now scheduled to depart at 7 AM this morning, returning to London. The American President Lines' "President Pierce," coming from the United States to Shanghai, was expected to arrive at noon yesterday but had not arrived by evening. According to the company, it was likely sheltering from the storm at sea and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. However, the exact time is uncertain because the company has not received a report from the ship. The Italian mail ship "Giulio Cesare," which arrived in Shanghai from Venice on August 28 and docked at the Kung Ho Hsiang wharf in Hongkou, finished unloading cargo. It was originally scheduled to depart for Europe yesterday, but it was delayed due to the hurricane. Now it is said that due to special circumstances, it may be delayed in Shanghai for several more days. A definite message is expected this morning. The date of the ship's departure for Hong Kong and Luzon will also be delayed accordingly. The Hai Fo of the Reiss Company, joining the Shanghai-Ningbo line, was delayed due to the hurricane. According to the company, all passengers and cargo have been loaded, and it is scheduled to depart at 4 AM this morning, first heading to Zhenhai. The import ships today should be able to return to normal. The Huangpu River ferries also did not operate yesterday.</p>

<h3>Foreign Businesses Refuse to Trade on Account with Japanese Puppet Regime: American Company Unable to Recover Over 170,000 in Debt; Decision Made to Require Cash Transactions Going Forward</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, last night (the 29th), responsible parties heard that foreign businesses in Shanghai were dealing with the "Great Way" government and the Japanese army. Because a certain important Japanese financial institution acting on behalf of the puppet regime and the Japanese army had not repaid a huge debt, the foreign businesses decided last week to base transactions on "cash on delivery" and refused to extend credit any further. It is reported that a certain American company here learned last week that it was unable to recover 175,000 yuan owed by the "Great Way" agency. This shows the extent of the losses suffered by foreign businesses. It is generally believed that the Japanese agency's inability to repay its debts is due to a severe shortage of cash. Moreover, Japanese financial institutions are now feeling a shortage of cash.</p>
<h3>American Warship Marblehead Sails to Qingdao, Then to North China for Routine Patrol</h3>

<h3>Central Bank's New Subsidiary Coin Notes: Decision Made to Issue Cautiously</h3>
<p>Currently Researching Adding Markings to Prevent Abuse, to Issue No Later Than the End of Next Month</p>
<p>The Central Bank of China's Shanghai branch, under orders to issue new one-cent and five-cent subsidiary coin notes, has recently learned that sample notes have fallen into the hands of criminals and are being used in a confusing manner. The branch fears that once the new notes are issued, the counterfeit notes could be mixed in, affecting the livelihoods of hawkers and ordinary people, which would be a greater impact than the postal substitute currency. In consideration of the livelihood of the people of Shanghai, a cautious decision has been made regarding the issuance of the notes to curb the troublemaking of criminals. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter, the Shanghai branch has reported this situation to the head office and is planning very comprehensive preventative measures. Whether the need is to reprint, the instructions have not yet been received from the head office. It is rumored that a decision has been made to re-design and reprint. Such news may be premature to spread at this time. Whether the notes need to be stamped with a special mark is currently being researched by the branch. As for the issue date of the new notes, whether they are reprinted or not, it will be no later than the end of next month. It is hoped that everyone will wait patiently for circulation and not blindly believe the rumors and slanders of criminals.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a bizarre murder case suddenly occurred inside the Tushanwan Cathedral in Xujiahui, Shanghai, and the victim was the director of the church, Father An. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Father's Brief History</p>
<p>Father An, a Frenchman, was over sixty years old. He had been preaching in China for many years. He was upright, sincere, diligent, cautious, and kind. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to charity, so he was deeply admired by the people of Shanghai.

<p>Lifeless for a Long Time</p>
<p>Around 5 PM in the afternoon, an orphaned worker went upstairs to report important matters to Father An. As soon as he pushed open the door, he saw Father An with his hands tied, murdered on the floor of his room. The worker screamed in horror. People heard the sound and rushed to the scene, but Father An had been lifeless for a long time. He was already cold to the touch. He immediately reported to the police station. The police chief immediately led Chinese and Western detectives to investigate in detail.</p>
<p>Officials Inspect</p>
<p>At the same time, the French military commander stationed in Shanghai and senior officials of the Consulate and the Public Works Bureau heard the news and personally went to inspect. This shows the extent to which Father An was respected in peacetime. The body is still temporarily kept in the room where he lived, waiting for the French authorities to examine it before preparing the coffin.</p>
<p>Reasons Speculated</p>
<p>As for the reason for An's death, according to general speculation, the orphanage and craft factory run by Father An was scheduled to issue a total of more than 4,000 yuan in salaries at the end of each month. Today was the salary payment day. The murderer assumed that Father An had already prepared the salary money in advance, so he committed this heinous act one day early. Whether the money was stolen is being kept absolutely secret by the police. On the one hand, they are intensifying their efforts to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>Pawnshop Industry Association Announces Increase in Pawn Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The members of the pawnshop industry association in this city have been affected by rising prices, increased expenses, and difficulty maintaining operations. They have sent letters to the industry association, stating their hardships and difficult circumstances, and requesting that a meeting of member representatives be convened to restore the original interest rate of 2% per month. Currently, the members of the industry only charge an interest rate of 1.8%. After the industry association carefully organized the opinions of the members, it convened a temporary meeting of new and old members at 3 PM on August 21 at the meeting place on the second floor of the Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company on Baker Road. After detailed discussion, in order to sympathize with the difficulties of the industry, it was decided to restore the previous interest rate of 2% per month. According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the members of the industry are well aware that this decision to increase interest rates will affect the burden on ordinary people, but the matter is unavoidable, and they hope that everyone will understand. The board of directors of the industry association has already approved the decision and decided to implement it from September 1, and issued a notice stating, "The members of this association in the city have been following the provisions of Article 11 of the City's Pawnshop Business Rules regarding the collection of interest on pawns, which is based on 2% per month. In recent years, due to environmental factors, although it has not exceeded the limit, there has been considerable inconsistency. Therefore, this association has convened a meeting of all members and decided that from September 1 of this year, all interest collection on pawns will still be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the City's Pawnshop Business Rules to show unity. At the same time, new pawn tickets will be used. For those that are not updated, the original pawn tickets will be stamped with a district mark and temporarily continued to be used. In addition to submitting to the superior for record, this is hereby notified."</p>

<h3>A Difficult Time for Monks: Three Cases Go to Trial Simultaneously; Monk Denies Instigating Escape</h3>
<p>The High Court Third Branch and the Second Special Court have a total of three courtrooms hearing cases of monks suing each other and being sued. Details are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Monk Wan Yuan Denies Instigating</p>
<p>Yang Sunshi (Sun Lanzhen, 35 years old, from Gaoyou), the beloved concubine of Yang Yunwu, a Gaoyou native who previously served as a county magistrate during the warlord era, was allegedly seduced and instigated by Wan Yuan, the resident monk of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple in the Jin Shenfu Road Sheng Deli area (whose secular name is Tong Changyao, 30 years old, from Taizhou), to abscond on the tenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar this year, taking with her 2,500 yuan in cash, three gold bracelets, and property deeds. Wan Yuan hired a lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper severing ties with Yang. Yang reported this to the French police, who first arrested Wan Yuan and found the stolen goods in his pillowcase. He was prosecuted by the Second Special Court for receiving stolen goods and sentenced to six months in prison. At the time, Yang Sunshi was at large, and the court issued a warrant for her arrest. She was recently apprehended and prosecuted by the Second Special Court for theft. After interrogation, Yang Sunshi was released on bail of 500 yuan. Details were published in yesterday's newspaper. Because Monk Wan Yuan was dissatisfied with the judgment, he hired Lawyer Xu Wufang to file an appeal with the High Court Third Branch. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Wang and Chen, held a collegial panel hearing. The appellant, Monk Wan Yuan, aka Tong Changyao, stated the grounds for his appeal, denying that he had seduced Yang Sunshi or instigated her escape. He only helped search for Sunshi after she ran away. The pillowcase found in his case was his own and not given to him by Sunshi. Witnesses Zhu Wanzhang and Zhang Yunfa testified that they saw the monk and Yang's concubine walking together and entering the Zhonghe Building at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road. However, Wan Yuan firmly denied this. The court reviewed the evidence and decided to postpone the hearing to bring Yang Sunshi to court for further questioning. The appellant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Temple Property Rights Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>Due to a dispute over overdue mortgages, the Sanjiao Leshan Temple in the Jin Shenfu Road Sheng Deli area was sued by the Yeguang Company, the creditor, and the court ruled in favor of the execution and auction. Monk Qinliang, the resident monk of Jingci Temple in Hangzhou, purchased the temple and renamed it the Lower Courtyard of Jingci Temple and went to take it over. However, Monk Yuanhua of Sanjiao Leshan Temple refused to hand it over. Monk Qinliang filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Yuanhua of obstructing freedom. At the same time, Qinliang sent people to forcibly take over the temple, placing the temple's property in the Yuhuang Temple next door. Now, Monks Guanru and Licheng, along with Zhang Chenshi and Yu Shaoshi, hired Lawyer Liu Xiang to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Qinliang and laypersons Xia Jianfu, Wu Boliang, Zhao Jinyu, Bai E Po Na Xin (transliteration), and Fan Yusheng of obstructing freedom of worship, intimidation, extortion, and property damage. This was reported in a previous newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian of the Second Special Court continued the hearing in the Sixth Criminal Court. Guanru and others' private prosecution against Qinliang and others for obstructing freedom, both parties arrived with their lawyers. After a detailed hearing, it was decided that the case would be suspended and the parties would be directed to confirm the ownership of the temple property in the Civil Division before proceeding with the hearing.</p>
<p>Lodging Monk Accused of Encroaching on Temple Property</p>
<p>Maolin, a monk currently residing at 1250 Connaught Road, 43 years old, from Yangzhou, filed a complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing Maochan, the resident monk of Baoguang Temple at 466 Xujiahui Road, Dapu Bridge, of encroaching on temple property and requesting an investigation, along with a civil suit to recover the temple property. According to the complaint, Baoguang Temple was founded by the plaintiff in the 25th year of the Republic. The defendant was one of the lodging monks in the temple. Last year, because a lodging monk left drugs in his room, the plaintiff was arrested and convicted. At that time, the plaintiff entrusted the temple affairs to lodging monk Puchan for management. However, the defendant drove Puchan out and took over the temple himself. When the plaintiff was released from prison and returned to the temple, the defendant refused to return the temple property. Repeated negotiations were ineffective. The defendant has committed the crime of encroachment and requests an investigation and an order to return the temple property and accounts. Based on the complaint, Judge Wu Kechou of the court held a hearing yesterday morning. Both parties arrived on time. After the plaintiff recounted the events, the defendant was questioned. The defendant denied the encroachment, claiming to be falsely accused, and presented evidence. Since the plaintiff's lawyer arrived at the court but had not submitted a letter of authorization, the court decided to postpone the hearing to be reheard at a later date.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery: Two Criminals Arrested, Suspect Apprehended</h3>
<p>Chai Yunlong and Cai Jing, employees of the Hengfeng Woolen Company at 368 Xiangfen Lane, Tianjin Road, were ordered by Manager Chai Yanqing on the afternoon of the 29th (the day before yesterday) at about 1 p.m. to go to the Zhiyu Qianzhuang in Ruyi Lane, Henan Road, to withdraw 6,000 yuan in legal currency, divided into two bundles. Chai and Cai each carried one bundle to deliver to the Shanghai Bank to clear checks. As they were walking in front of No. 335 Sichuan Road, they were suddenly robbed by bandits. When Cai fought back, he was shot in the left arm by the bandits. The Chinese police arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested two criminals on the spot: Wang Arong from Hangzhou and Shen Guilin from Pudong. Part of the stolen goods and a handgun were found as evidence and taken to the police station. Later, according to their confession, a suspect named Qian Shiqin was apprehended at No. 37, Lane 727, Tiantong Road. They were brought to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer charged them with attempted robbery and murder. Qian Shiqin's involvement has not yet been determined and is requested to be detained temporarily. Cai Jing was injured and treated at Baolong Hospital and was unable to attend court. Chai Yunlong testified about the robbery and the bandits firing the gun. The Chinese police reported the circumstances of the arrest. The court questioned the defendants, who admitted that Qian Dechang, who is still at large, initiated the robbery and instructed them to go. The handgun was borrowed from a friend in Pudong. The court ordered the defendants to be detained for questioning again next Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Education Department: Relieving Displaced Teachers and Students in War Zones, Has Ordered All Parties to Undertake Various Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Correspondence) Since the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou became tense and counties and cities were ordered to evacuate, the Guangdong Education Department, in order to facilitate all levels of schools in coping with emergencies, previously formulated the "Measures for Handling Schools at All Levels in Evacuated Areas," which the provincial government has circulated for compliance. It is now found that there are many schools at all levels that cannot be moved, can be moved, or have had to suspend classes due to being close to the war zone. The teachers and students who have withdrawn from these schools should be provided with relief. The Education Department has instructed the principals of 20 counties, including Huiyang, Haifeng, Heyuan, Zijin, Xinfeng, Longmen, Raoping, Huilai, Puning, Fengshun, Xingning, Meixian, Wuhua, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Kai Chuan, Heping, and Dabu, and the principals of Meizhou Middle School, Meizhou Normal School, Meizhou Women's Normal School, Meizhou Agricultural School, and East River Temporary Middle School, to find ways to contact the principals and teachers of the withdrawing middle schools and accommodate them as much as possible. At the same time, they should handle registration in accordance with the regulations and submit it to the department for verification, and telegraph the administrative commissioners of the 4th, 5th, and 6th districts, explaining the relief measures and requesting them to transfer them to the counties and schools within their respective jurisdictions to accommodate them as much as possible. All accommodated students are allowed to stay in the school during the summer vacation, and their board and lodging expenses will be handled in accordance with the supplementary food expense measures issued by the department.</p>
<p>Also, according to reports, most of the teachers and students who withdrew from Qiongya stayed in Suixi and Hong Kong. The Education Department has provided them with relief, setting up registration offices in various places and setting up temporary middle schools to accommodate middle school students, and attaching elementary schools to the United Middle School to accommodate elementary school students. Regarding teacher relief, in addition to registration, service groups and united middle schools are being established for accommodation.</p>
<h3>Jiang Wenyu on the Great Era and the Elementary School Teacher (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Expecting Special Actions from Elementary School Teachers</p>
<p>Reasonable Treatment for Material and Spiritual Needs</p>
<p>Eight Proposed Measures Eagerly Awaited for Implementation</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the issue of expectations. What we expect from elementary school teachers, of course, is that they can run elementary schools according to rules, teach children well within the school, abide by laws and regulations, explain clearly, and educate properly. However, in this great era, I believe that the mission they bear is more than that. It goes without saying that elementary school teachers in the so-called guerrilla areas in the rear should be able to use special educational methods to achieve special educational results. However, all elementary school teachers in the rear cannot just educate school children and consider that they have fulfilled their responsibilities. For example, assisting political workers in mobilizing the masses, helping local people organize self-government and self-defense, cooperating with guerrilla teams to undertake various military-related tasks, promoting the elimination of illiteracy among women, educating adults in addition to educating children, and finding ways to improve the health of local people, starting with protecting children in the school and gradually extending to the general public. It can be said that all these things were not necessary or required for elementary school teachers to do in the past. However, at this moment, they have to take on these additional responsibilities. This is the current practical need. In the future, after the war ends, how education will be revived in the places that have been destroyed and ravaged must also be thought of and prepared for now. If the school buildings are destroyed and the school equipment is gone, how do we restore the schools? If we wait for the county government to raise the construction and equipment costs one by one, or wait for the public to build the houses and purchase the school equipment before letting the elementary school teachers go to class in a leisurely manner, I am afraid it will not be easy. Not to mention that after the devastation, all construction requires funds, and funds cannot be raised in large amounts, and even if they are raised, they cannot be used exclusively for education. (Of course, comforting the displaced is the most important thing. Then, how do we revive education? In my opinion, elementary school teachers should have a special set of skills and special methods to cope with this special need. If there are no school buildings, it doesn't matter; the teachers can unite with nearby farmers and work together to build simple thatched houses, which cost little and can be completed quickly. If there are no desks, benches, blackboards, or even all the necessary school equipment, it doesn't matter; they can either make them themselves, or unite the farmers, explain the reasons, and let the children who come to school bring their own small desks and benches to school, according to the old private school methods. As for the simple instruments and specimens used in natural science teaching, and the simple charts and diagrams used in social science teaching, regardless of whether they are good or bad, as long as they exist, they can also be made by the teachers themselves. At the same time, in rural elementary schools, small workshops should be attached, and teachers should lead students to plant, raise livestock, and engage in simple manual manufacturing. In this way, not only can elementary education in the recovered areas be easily revived, but it can also be specially developed. Even the elementary schools that were originally in the rear can change their style and show a new atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Finance: British and American Exchange Rates Rebound Sharply; US Dollar in the City Becomes More Loose; Chinese Merchants Sell More Eagerly; Swap Has Been Tightened</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates rebounded sharply because the British and American exchange rates were encouraged by the Soviet Union's temporary suspension of approval of the non-aggression treaty signed with Germany, rising by 1 jiao and 1 fen and 1 jiao and 0.025 li respectively. The situation in Europe was not as bad as in the past few days. Therefore, the unofficial market in the city opened with an anti-image of strong British gold and loose American dollars. British gold was still 3 pence 9375, and the US dollar hardened to 7 yuan 1875. Later, because Germany and the Soviet Union were on good terms, Japan was eager to win over Britain and the United States, so there was a rumor of peace in the Far East. Therefore, the general long positions, such as China Bank and speculators, have all made double profits. When the current situation may change, they seize the opportunity to come out of the market. In addition, Hong Kong also sent a telegram to fill the market, so the US dollar market trend was uniquely loose and cheap. Once, the bank's buying reached 7 yuan 4375. However, because HSBC bought as much as possible at 4 pence, the loose trend was blocked, and the price stabilized at the 4 pence mark. Extending to the noon closing result, British gold only loosened 0.046875, while the US dollar soared 0.325. Because there was a rumor that the small quasi-swap arbitrage would start in September, Chinese merchants were more eager to sell September futures, and the loose trend was more severe than the spot price. In the end, British gold closed at 3 pence 78125, and the US dollar closed at 6 yuan 875. Therefore, the swap was tightened, with British gold only 0.203125 away and the US dollar only 0.04375 away, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6.3% (excluding commissions). In fact, it is still difficult for arbitragers to obtain it. The half-day transaction was still strong.</p>
<p>British Gold Stabilized at 4 Pence</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large strips, both near and far, rose by 0.375. New York's silver price increased by 0.0875. London's raw gold shrank by 4 shillings. The exchange rate of British pound against the US dollar increased by 1 jiao and 1 fen, against Shanghai by 0.0125, and against France by 25 centimes. The US dollar against the British pound increased by 0.1025 li, against Shanghai by a small 0.75 yuan, and against France decreased by 0.0425. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 3 pence 9375 for British gold and 7 yuan 1875 for the US dollar, compared to the previous day, British gold was flat and the US dollar loosened by 0.01875, which was due to the sharp rebound in exchange rates. After the opening, foreign firms were quite willing to sell, but the buying appetite was not good. It is said that a certain US bank successively sold spot US dollars at 7 yuan 1875 and 25 to Japanese banks and foreign firms. Then, China Bank and speculators sold spot British gold at 4 pence to HSBC. Therefore, the process was firm. When HSBC's listed prices were announced and did not move, and the silver balance tax was announced, which was 2.25%, rumors of peace in the Far East caused most long positions to compete to sell. However, British gold was stabilized and unchanged because HSBC had unlimited buying appetite at 4 pence. However, because foreign firms were bullish on the US dollar exchange rate, their buying appetite was extremely weak, so it uniquely trended loose and cheap. China Bank and speculators successively sold spot British gold at 4 pence to HSBC, and also sold spot US dollars at 7 yuan 3125 to 4375 to foreign firms. Then, Chinese merchants sold September US dollars at 6 yuan 625 to 9375 to foreign firms. Near noon, a Hong Kong telegram sold spot British gold at 4 pence and spot US dollars at 7 yuan 375 to HSBC and other foreign firms. There were rumors of some swap trading. It is said that a British bank sold US dollars at a premium of 0.053125 to a peer bank, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 7.8% (excluding commissions). Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 pence 984375 for British gold and 7 yuan 3125 for the US dollar. The September prices were 3 pence 78125 for British gold and 6 yuan 875 for the US dollar. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British gold increased by 0.046875, the US dollar strengthened by 0.3125, September British gold weakened by 0.00125, and the US dollar loosened by 0.5 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Also Saw a Sharp Loosening</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 30th Dispatch: The market opened this morning without a telegram to Shanghai. At 10:30, the market was firm. Spot British exchange rate was unchanged, still 1 shilling 2 pence 96875. Spot US dollar sharply loosened by 0.0875 to 27 yuan 625. At 11:05, it was stable. Spot British exchange rate tightened by 0.003125 to 1 shilling 3 pence 9375. Spot US dollar shrank by 0.00125 to 27 yuan 5 jiao. Shanghai exchange rate was unchanged, still 370 yuan. Japanese exchange rate was unknown.</p>
<p>More Foreign Currencies Fell Than Rose</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currencies were generally weak because the foreign exchange footings were loose and the cash was weak, hovering around the 4,000 yuan mark. The demand for British and American gold pounds was scarce and declined. The sentiment for British and American gold certificates was bleak and moved downstream. French franc certificates were also weakly small. Hong Kong, Singapore, Netherlands, and Roby certificates were all converted to firm and expensive because they were unrelated to the current situation. Canadian and Philippine certificates followed the loosening of the US dollar and went down. The demand for Siamese certificates was scarce, and the market was weak. Japanese gold certificates were stable, with the evening market at 1 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen 5 li. Korean certificates were still 1 yuan 0.05 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both decreased by 1 yuan, British gold certificates decreased by 0.2 yuan, US gold certificates decreased by 0.4 yuan, Hong Kong certificates increased by 0.02 yuan, French franc certificates decreased by 0.0005 yuan, Singapore, Netherlands, and Roby certificates all increased by 0.2 yuan, and Canadian, Philippine, and Siamese certificates all decreased by 0.2 yuan. There were no changes to other currencies.</p>
<p>British and American Silver Prices Recovered</p>
<p>London, 29th Dispatch: Large-strip silver market, both near and far, recovered by 0.375 due to speculative buying. Supply was limited, and the market was stable. After the closing, buyers were satisfied. The metal market came to sell, and there were buyers at 0.0625 below the listed price. Also, New York telegram: US silver price also increased by 0.0875 for spot goods, to 0.37 yuan. Also, Meng Mao telegram: Indian silver futures were unchanged, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Rediscount Rate Increased by 2.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's exchange draft rediscount rate showed a slight increase. The morning rate was still 177.5 yuan per thousand yuan, and the afternoon rate slightly increased to 180 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was still 1.8 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Cash Selling Trend Strengthens</h3>
<p>The cash market was still erratic yesterday, sometimes up and sometimes down, making it difficult to grasp. The psychology of large amounts had unfavorable news for the multi-party and tended to be weak. Generally, it first hovered, then declined, and then slightly recovered. Initially, because British pure gold sharply retreated and foreign exchange reported firmly, it retreated to 4,070 yuan at the morning opening. Later, because a certain money exchange industry still had buying appetite, it once pulled up to a high of 4,110 yuan. Soon, there was a sudden rumor of peace in the market, and the US dollar exchange rate soared, so the general retail investors who were timid immediately came out of the market. At the same time, the silver shop gangs also frequently came to sell, and the Hong Kong gang's purchasing stopped, causing the market price to plummet to 4,020 yuan. At noon, it slightly recovered to 4,040 yuan at the closing. The afternoon opening lacked maintenance and was violently pressed to a low of 3,970 yuan. After entering the market, the money exchange industry, a certain bank, and gold shops came to absorb, so it recovered to 4,020 yuan at the closing. As a result, it fell by 85 yuan compared to the previous day. The total transaction was about 1,000 taels. The silver shop ornaments fell by 10 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold sharply retreated.</p>
<p>Once Again Entered the 4,000 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Since the early morning, the price (10 taels) at the beginning was 35 yuan lower because foreign exchange reported increased, causing many sellers. The silver shop gang sold 20 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 4,070 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry frequently absorbed on behalf of customers, and the sellers did not surge, so the price gradually increased. Soon it went back to the 4,100 yuan mark. Money exchange industry did 30 taels with each other at a price of 4,110 yuan, which was the highest point of the day. After that, a certain gold shop suddenly turned to selling, so the price declined. Soon it was pressed down by 35 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 50 taels to a peer shop at a price of 4,075 yuan. Later, another money exchange industry strongly absorbed more than 100 taels, so the price once again increased to the 4,100 yuan mark. At that time, there was a sudden rumor in the market that there was peace in the Far East, and the foreign exchange US dollar was quite loose, causing the trend to turn downward again. Money exchange industry and securities gangs and silver shop gangs competed to force the market down, and customer gangs and retail investors were all watching. Before long, the price plummeted by 80 yuan. Money exchange industry sold 20 taels to the silver shop gang at a price of 4,020 yuan. Near noon, retail investors made profits and re-entered the market, so the market stabilized slightly. Gold shop bought 10 taels from the money exchange industry at 4,040 yuan, the closing price at noon yesterday. Because the money exchange industry was quite willing to sell in the afternoon, and at one time buyers were watching, the price was violently pressed down by 70 yuan. The money exchange industry sold 30 taels to the gold shop at a price of 3,970 yuan. Later, retail investors absorbed at a low price, so the price gradually recovered. Before long, it rose by 50 yuan. The money exchange industry did 20 taels with each other at a price of 4,020 yuan. Soon it fell by 15 yuan. Securities gang sold 20 taels to the gold shop at a price of 4,005 yuan. Later, a certain bank came to absorb slightly and raised the price slightly. A certain bank bought 30 taels from the money exchange industry at 4,020 yuan, the closing price last night. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the market, and the current standard gold was 65 yuan lower than the listed gold. There were few transactions.</p>
<p>Silver Shop Ornaments Hung at 10 Yuan Lower</p>
<p>The silver shop ornaments were exchanged at 415 yuan per tael at the beginning of the day. At 12:18, the price was lowered by 5 yuan. At 2:10 PM, it was lowered by another 5 yuan. It is estimated that the price was 405 yuan for the large same-trade shops and 403 yuan for the new same-trade shops. The price for buying back decreased by about 20 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pound Turned Firm and Pure Gold Fell Sharply</p>
<p>London, 29th Dispatch: British pure gold retreated sharply because the news of the extension of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty was heard. Therefore, the British pound turned firm, and many long positions sold hard, causing it to retreat by 4 shillings per ounce, which was 7 pounds 17 shillings. Therefore, the Central Bank's Chinese cash buying price also retreated to 1,281 yuan 4 jiao. The listed customs gold also retreated by 0.069 yuan, estimated at 2 yuan 5 jiao 3.2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 32.5 yuan, estimated at 1,276 yuan 7 jiao.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bullish on Domestic Bonds, Strong Interest</h3>
<p>The securities dark market yesterday saw a gradual increase in activity. The market appeared to be expanding slightly, with both buyers and sellers being relatively active. As a result, general sentiment was mostly upward. Given the significant fluctuations in market prices and the cooling weather, there was a proposal to switch to full-day trading. The market was filled with an atmosphere of peace, with talk of Britain and America being entrusted to mediate. Consequently, market prices were stable in the morning but surged in the afternoon, with trading becoming increasingly lively. A major player with a long-standing reputation in the government bond market also exerted extra effort to buy. Gold dealers also became increasingly interested. Sellers were mostly bulls taking profits, with some re-entering the market after selling. In the morning, buying focused on Dingkang, Lianyi, Yongkang, and Hongkang, while in the afternoon, Tongkang, Defu, and No. 25 were strong. Sellers were retail investors taking profits in the morning and Runli bulls exiting in the afternoon. The trend was dominated by bullish momentum. As a result, at the end of the day, except for Ding, which saw a slight drop in the afternoon due to not opening, all other categories rose by one to one dollar and twenty cents. The total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 1.5 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Chinese Securities Exchange were traded at a price of 24.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that yesterday's stock market sentiment was generally more cheerful, which clearly resonated with the overnight gains in major markets in London and New York. Although the scope of trading was not large, price increases were widespread, indicating that bulls were not eager to liquidate their positions hastily. The next day or two will be a crucial stage for the European dispute's resolution. If war can be avoided, we anticipate significant progress in the market situation, as the situation in this port has eased from tension to relaxation, and there is a possibility of improved relations among the powers in China. This trend is likely inevitable.</p>
<p>London British Far East Company Stocks: On the 29th of this month (Wednesday), the listed market showed slight improvement. Kailan Mining unregistered shares rose 9 pence to 13 shillings and 3 pence. Gula Kelin Rubber shares rebounded 7.5 pence to 16 shillings and 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Bonds: On the 29th of this month (Tuesday), the listed market was stagnant, with bids but no offers. Listed prices on the upside showed slight increases. Anglo-German continuation (English issue) rose £4 to £45. Sino-French US dollars rose £6 to £38. Anglo-French (English issue) and Reorganization (English issue) each rose £3, to £43 and £28 respectively. Chrisp continuation rose £1.5 to £20. Vickers-Vimy loan rose £1 to £10. Railway bonds on the downside saw minimal changes. Longhai Railway loan rose £3 to £12. Huguang Railway (non-German issue) fell £1 to £12. The rest remained stable.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: New Yangzhou Hemp on the Market, Price Opens at 25 Yuan</h3>
<p>For new miscellaneous grains, white sesame seeds were put on the market over the past two days, totaling over 70 packages from Yangzhou. Although the harvest this year is not perfect in the Jiangbei area, it cannot be considered a poor harvest either. The output is still acceptable, but the seeds are slightly thin and contain heavy mud and ash. Prices opened at 25 yuan for the past two days, distributed by this street. The market situation is still stable. It is said that fewer large shipments will arrive in the near future. Other soybeans show a potential for a firm yet flexible situation. Broad beans are turning from prosperity to decline. Yesterday, due to sudden wind and rain, trading in the market was scarce, with only 590 packages of soybeans, over 600 packages of broad beans, and 300 packages of corn being traded.</p>
<h3>Food: Out-of-Town Merchants Seek Quick Sales, Rice Prices Drop Again by About 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Du Geng: Yesterday, due to the wind and rain, no supplies arrived from various sources. There were also very few cart packages, only over 2,000 packages. However, the market decline continued, as market goods were plentiful and out-of-town merchants rarely visited due to the wind and rain. Moreover, seeing the continuous sharp decline in the market in recent days, their sentiment was disheartened. Apart from local shops making slight purchases, there were few new entries. Therefore, sales were quiet, and the market was filled with inventory, resulting in oversupply. Out-of-town merchants sought to sell quickly to avoid losses, but the lower the prices, the more pessimistic the sentiment. As a result, various Geng and Chenxin prices fell again by about 2 yuan. Gaoxi Geng opened at 33 yuan and closed at 29 yuan. Su Tongkun Geng at 30 yuan and 29 yuan. Early and late rice from Hebei at 28 yuan, original package at 30 yuan and 29 yuan. Chen Wu Jian from 30 yuan to 27 yuan, new Jian at 24 yuan, Gaoxin Jian from Jiangbei at 27 yuan to 25 yuan. Jiashan Xin Chuan Jian at 24 yuan, Xin Yang Jian from 26 yuan to 25.5 yuan, Du Jian at 25.5 yuan, Bian Yuan not opened. Total transaction volume for the city was estimated at over 3,000 packages.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Although the number of carts arriving yesterday was slightly reduced, the sellers' sentiment was weak, and they were all eager to sell. New Xian and low-priced damp rice from various regions were sold at reduced prices. However, buyers feared further price drops and had no need for them. The market was again in a state of oversupply, with both new and old Xian seeing a further drop of about 2 yuan. Special Ke Xian was only 28-29 yuan, Jue Xin Xian was only 13.5 yuan, and coarse Xian Jue was as low as under 20 yuan. However, sentiment has not stabilized, as it seems that the ban on Jiangbei has been lifted, and transportation to various ports along the Yangtze River may be possible, suggesting a continuous flow of future supplies.</p>
<h3>Flour Mill Market: Opening Down 2 Jiao, Wheat Stagnant</h3>
<p>Flour: Trading in spot flour continued to be sluggish. Since the decline in returned goods, mill prices have struggled to remain stable. Yesterday, with the further decline in rice prices, more return cargo bills flowed out of the market. Actual sales relied solely on scattered purchases from this street. North-South out-of-town sales were even more difficult to expect. Therefore, sentiment weakened, and various mills had to take the initiative to reduce prices. Yesterday, the No. 2 flour mill price was changed to 4.2 yuan in cash, a decrease of 2 jiao from the previous price. The total transaction volume in the city was estimated at around 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: Due to the wind and rain, wheat arrivals were sharply reduced. Although the mills claimed to be connected, they focused on eating the market and intended to buy at lower prices. National demand was exhausted, so the market was stagnant. There were no formal transactions throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Dealers Revive Yarn Sales, Double Horse Brand Stalls at High Price, Double Globe and Angel Brands are Sought After</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned upwards again. However, in actual transactions, Hong Kong dealers showed slight activity, selling 490 packages. However, the 20-count Double Horse yarn, which was previously actively traded, has recently seen a sudden shift in their sentiment towards apathy. According to market reports, a suspected incident occurred in Guangxi, and they were detained by the authorities. As a result, the sales momentum of Double Horse has been greatly diminished. Therefore, they are actively purchasing medium-count yarn. As a result, the selling prices of the 20-count Double Globe and Angel brands have become increasingly high. In fact, the price of Double Horse is too high. For the same factory's products, the 20-count Angel is about 100 yuan different. Judging from the current situation, it may be possible to converge in step.</p>
<p>In the morning, there were rumors that Hong Kong dealers had buying interest in spot yarn, and the industry unanimously raised prices. However, with prices too high, buyers were not seen. Around 9:50 am to almost 10:00 am, Guang dealers first bought 20-count Double Globe at a high price of 15 yuan. Double Horse was once shouted out randomly, but the old buyers did not support it, with the opening price being 680 yuan. After a while, it fell back by 10 yuan, but the prices of other yarns did not move. The price fell to 665 yuan in the middle of the day, and then rebounded again at the close. The transaction volume for the half-day was counted at 1,075 packages. The market conditions were that 20-count Double Horse rose by 10 yuan, and Angel Double Globe rose by 20 yuan. The purchase volume of each dealer is as follows: Hong Kong 490, Mainland 70, Counterparts 515, Total 1,075</p>
<h3>New Cotton: Spot Cotton Mills Wait and See</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading has completely stalled. As new cotton will soon be available in large quantities, factories are all waiting and seeing and not making purchases. Although there have been strong tides and storms recently, coastal cotton fields have certainly been affected. Other parts have not suffered significant damage. The first batch of Tonghua cotton arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday was priced at 109 yuan and sold out. Today, due to the hurricane in Shanghai, shipping from northern Jiangsu has been suspended, and no goods have arrived. No spot cotton trading has taken place.</p>
<p>Another report: The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. Various counterparts are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the situation. Although trading is quiet, the cotton prices are unusually high. Recently, due to the high price of customs gold, the cotton tax has increased by more than 5 jiao per dan. Therefore, the counterparts are quite firm in their intentions.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Price Adjustment: The New York cotton market was relatively active yesterday as the European situation eased slightly. The market initially surged by more than 10 pounds due to purchases by overseas cotton merchants. Later, the market weakened slightly due to selling by southern dealers in the market and the liquidation of some bullish positions. As a result, the closing price was still up 12-13 pounds compared to the previous day. India was closed yesterday, and today's forecast is not much different from yesterday's closing price. Egypt fell 7-8 pounds, and Liverpool fell more than 10 pence.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Prices of Coarse and Fine Twill Fabrics Decline, Transactions are Also Quiet</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the hurricane, there was no business in the street shops, and out-of-town sales were even more sluggish. Very few new transactions were booked, as the market was weak and buyers were increasingly cautious. Therefore, only the white cloth market saw slight changes, with fine cloth and fine twill falling by 2-3 jiao per piece, and coarse cloth and coarse twill falling by 1-2 jiao. Wholesale shops in this street made slight purchases of 40-50 pieces. However, as it was the end of the month, order deliveries were slightly busier than usual. However, the remaining balance of orders for this month was small, far from the boom of the previous months.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill saw slight activity from the northern Liaohuangdao dealers. Local counterparts also made some purchases to cover short positions as the end of the month approached. Therefore, the total transaction volume for the day reached 600-700 pieces. The market price was shouted up by 1-2 jiao per piece. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth spot goods required 17.8 yuan, and Baby fine twill spot goods were priced at 16.25 yuan, and warehouse bills at 16.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Smooth and Thick Woolen Cloth Transactions are Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was demand for smooth and thick woolen cloth from out-of-town dealers. Local old goods dealers and overcoat workshops also made new purchases, resulting in a brisk market. Large wholesalers opened briskly, with many shipments to foreign firms. Lower-end goods were even more popular, and standard market prices rose sharply again. 707 rose to 6 yuan net, and 1080 rose to 5.6 yuan net. There was not much inventory among counterparts, as Polish spot merchants had also sold out. Due to foreign exchange rates, new goods have mostly telegraphed for slow loading. Occasionally, a small number of imports are at a cost of about 7 yuan per yard. Therefore, wholesalers are now uniformly shouting for 7 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Telegrams Return Slightly, Association's Prices Remain High</h3>
<p>According to London telegrams yesterday, the sugar market for December was 6 shillings 0.75, slightly 2.25 pence, for March next year 6 shillings and 0.75 pence, slightly 2 pence, for June 6 shillings and 2 pence, slightly 2.25 pence. The association's prices in this city, spot 24th grade coarse white warehouse was 43.2 yuan, up half a yuan, foreign warehouse was 43 yuan, up 8 jiao, re-export was still 33 yuan. Taikoo car white east warehouse B brand rose 5 jiao to 7 jiao, initially 47 yuan, later rose to 47.2 yuan, west warehouse rose 2 jiao, to 47.2 yuan, also tightened later, CW brand 46.9 yuan, CX brand 46.6 yuan, DY brand 46.2 yuan, HX brand 46 yuan, H brand car red 30.6 yuan, Dutch red spot rose 7 jiao, to 40.3 yuan, re-export rose half a yuan, to 33.5 yuan. Native cotton white and No. 1 ice sugar were unchanged. The trend of national sugar remains firm, with no transactions.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Black Melon Seeds Rise Due to Poor Harvest</h3>
<p>Black melon seeds have recently risen steadily in price as the producing areas have been flooded and the harvest has been greatly reduced. According to reports, Ji Kui seeds have risen to 44 yuan. The local market has also followed closely. Yesterday, Haizhou seeds were heard at 35 yuan for 100 packages, Linhuai seeds at 32 yuan for 43 packages, Baoying seeds at 38 yuan for over 70 packages, Tongcheng seeds at 40 yuan for 50-60 packages, and ordinary Ji Kui seeds at 40 yuan to 42 yuan for over 20 packages.</p>
<h3>New Hainan Dried Longan: Market Price Returns Slightly by 5 Yuan</h3>
<p>The number of new batches of Hainan dried longan arriving after the opening of the new season was relatively large, and the market price has loosened slightly. Therefore, the market price has to drop slightly to cater to sales. The previous market dropped by 5 yuan, selling at 105 yuan. If the number of arrivals is not large in the future, then this price should be able to stand temporarily.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Galangal Arrives Sparsely, Stocks are Thin, Selling Price Rises by 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Galangal previously sold at 33 yuan. Recently, as the source has been cut off, the local reserves have become even more empty. Therefore, sellers have tightened their grip and are unwilling to release it easily. 10 packages were traded the day before yesterday at a price of 43 yuan, a rise of 10 yuan. If the outbound route is smooth, it is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Arrives</h3>
<p>Due to the tense situation in Europe, there are fears that once war breaks out, shipping will be obstructed, affecting supply of imported white coal. Sentiment is anticipating shortages, and the market is strong. However, according to recent observations, this is inaccurate. In addition to the continuous arrival of Hongji white coal, the Willie ship recently loaded over 3,000 tons of Mark white coal from French territory and stacked it in concessions. Counterparts are dismantling and selling it. Lump coal is 95 yuan per ton, and the dock handling fee is added to the truck.</p>
<h3>Hardware: White Iron Pipes and Radiator Pipes are Too Expensive, Sales are Stagnant</h3>
<p>White Iron Pipes: Transactions have decreased greatly recently, because the market is too high, and merchants are waiting and seeing and not making purchases. Although the local waterworks cannot lack this product, the number of purchases is also decreasing. However, due to the tight exchange rate, the opening price has risen by 2-3 jiao to 1-2 yuan from before. Currently, 4 fen is selling for 7 jiao 8 fen per foot, 6 fen for 8 jiao 8 fen, 1 inch for 1.2 yuan, 1 inch 4 fen for 1.65 yuan, 2 inches for 2.8 yuan, and 3 inches for 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Radiator Pipes: The railway and local construction are booming, but out-of-town locations have greatly reduced. The biggest impact is also the high price. Although there are scattered sales in the shops, the numbers are not wide. Currently, such as 1 inch 4 fen is selling at 2.25 yuan per foot, 2 inches at 3.2 yuan, and 2 inches 5 fen at 4.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Italian Artificial Silk Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>240 pieces of Italian artificial silk were shipped by the Italian ship Rulian Gai Sa (transliteration), which arrived on the 28th of the previous day. Only 90 pieces of this artificial silk were for this city, and the remaining 150 pieces were transferred to Tianjin. It is reported that the ship also carried over 300 boxes of woolen cloth. There are also 10 pieces of artificial silk shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>On "Hiding" in the Literary World (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qin Lao</p>
<p>Judging from this historical development, our current movement of literary figures reviving pseudonyms is naturally a further step of "progress."</p>
<p>It is not difficult to describe the characteristics of this further "progress."</p>
<p>First of all, the nature of the current movement is much more complex. Although writers using pseudonyms in the first period bore the burden of "theft," judging from the tone of the opponents, as long as they did not use pseudonyms, the pejorative could be withdrawn. Although the methods of opponents in the second period were terrifying, writers using pseudonyms who were truly angered and wrote their real names would immediately suffer great losses. However, what the opponents did on the surface was still the same old tune. If you ignored them, they still had no way to deal with you. But the current situation is different. Our literary figures scold you for "hiding" and being lowly and dirty, and will definitely give you a terrible label. The effect is: If you are angered and write your real name, you are a sinner, and if you continue to use a pseudonym, you are still guilty. In short, they want to prevent you from escaping. This meticulous "legal net" is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Secondly, the current literary figures not only do not have the stupidity of their ancestors in the first period, but are also smarter than their ancestors in the second period. Although the anti-pseudonym advocates in the first period later began to use pseudonyms themselves, they were all true to their names and did not change their surnames. The anti-pseudonym advocates in the second period were also somewhat stupid in this regard. In order to scold others, they were still willing to reveal their true faces. But the current situation is different. Our literary figures, while scolding others for "hiding," are actually "hiding" themselves, and the more fiercely they scold, the faster their "hiding" skills become. This is just like detectives catching "reactionaries": Those who are caught have to disguise themselves in order to defend themselves, while those who catch them scold them for being cunning, but disguise themselves even more severely. This approach is also worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>With this further "progress," our literary figures righteously shout to those who use pseudonyms: "Come out! If you are a hero, come out!"</p>
<p>But will anyone really "come out"? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Because "coming out" or not "coming out" is the same as being a sinner, it is better to simply "hide" more securely and not "come out." Also, seeing that the person shouting for you to "come out" is wearing European medieval armor, wrapped in iron pieces, only revealing two eyes, and yet wants you to learn from modern swimmers, appearing naked, just thinking about it, it is still better not to "come out." — In a word: There are no such fools in the world.</p>
<p>From this perspective, writers will probably continue to "hide," and even with our enthusiastic literary figures, it is feared that it will be difficult to reverse this decline. The literary world will ultimately be difficult to have a "bright day." Alas!</p>
<h3>About Teeth</h3>
<p>— Cao Xiqin Ke, translated by Luo Hong</p>
<p>Our friend, Aige Liji, has some tooth problems. Those teeth are starting to loosen.</p>
<p>Of course, time is very important for this type of ailment. When you get old, the so-called natural mechanism of the teeth is destroyed, the tendons and bones become weak, and the teeth become useless.</p>
<p>When Ivan Aige Liji Shasazhi Fu lived with me last year, he started losing his teeth late.</p>
<p>The first tooth was indeed knocked out during an argument with someone. The other teeth fell out on their own for no reason. For example, sometimes he was eating something and it would fall out, sometimes he was discussing the issue of high and low wages and the tooth would break into pieces, and sometimes he was alone and the tooth would explode. This is really the strangest thing. In a short period of time, he lost six teeth.</p>
<p>But Aige Liji didn't care much. He wasn't afraid of becoming a toothless person. He had insurance. If he needed it, he could immediately have his teeth put back in. He was very proud of this plan and often said:</p>
<p>"I'm not stingy about teeth at all. If they fall out, I can make them grow back. I don't want anyone touching my nose or anywhere on my face, but I don't care about teeth. I'm not worried. We insured people are very safe."</p>
<p>So when Aige Liji lost six teeth, he decided to make his first repair decision. He took his insurance policy and took a small car to the provincial dental hospital.</p>
<p>The consulting physicians were very happy to receive him.</p>
<p>"Of course," they said. "We can fix them for you with a metal tray. So how many have you lost? According to the regulations of our insurance charter, it does not take effect until you have lost eight teeth. If you lose eight or more teeth, that's your good fortune and our misfortune. If you haven't lost eight, we can't do anything for you. Dentists can't waste time on these trivial matters. The charter stipulates this number for insurance."</p>
<p>"I lost six," Aige Liji told them.</p>
<p>"We're very sorry," they said,</p>
<p>"We can't do anything for you now, friend. Just let it be. Wait. If you're lucky, as long as two or three more fall out, we can fix them."</p>
<p>Aige Liji was very angry.</p>
<p>"What? Do you want me to knock them out? Why?"</p>
<p>"Of course you don't need to knock them out," they said. "Just let it take its course. You wait. If you're lucky, as long as two or three more fall out, we can fix them."</p>
<p>Returning home from the dental hospital, he was very emotional. He understood about teeth. Now everything was unexpectedly complicated.</p>
<p>He hoped that the extra two or three teeth would fall out quickly.</p>
<p>One fell out quickly. Aige Liji sometimes played with filing the other one smooth. Of course, the tooth quickly fell out of the tooth socket.</p>
<p>Aige Liji immediately rushed to the dental hospital.</p>
<p>"Now," he said, "The conditions of the regulations are all met—I have lost eight teeth."</p>
<p>"That's great," they told him. "Now we can work for you. Are those teeth that fell out in the same position? Because according to our charter, eight teeth must fall out in a row. If they are not in the same position, then we still can't do anything. We still can't handle eight teeth falling out in different places. Of course, you understand that if the teeth that fall out are not in a row, then you can still chew things!"</p>
<p>"They did not fall out in the same position," Aige Liji said.</p>
<p>"Then sorry, we can't do anything."</p>
<p>Poor Aige Liji had nothing to say. He could only clench his remaining teeth and angrily walked out of the dental hospital.</p>
<p>What a disappointment. He could only live with his fate, and all hope was swept away.</p>
<p>From then on, Aige Liji changed his lifestyle. He lived very quietly, only eating liquid food, and brushing his teeth three times a day.</p>
<p>Under such caution, the regulations of the dental hospital had very good results.</p>
<h3>Should I Remove It?</h3>
<h3>Underground Fire (Book Review)</h3>
<p>— Yang Fei</p>
<p>"Underground Fire" is a "full-length reportage" depicting "illegal activities" under the Nazi swastika.</p>
<p>The author, the German Liepmann (H.LiePmann), "is not a socialist, nor a member of any political party," and according to him, "he himself does not have a definite political belief": However, at that time, he was working as a correspondent for an American newspaper, and at the same time he "believed that a writer should be a moral person," so he not only carefully investigated the truth of various events under Nazi rule and reported them correctly, but also gave deep sympathy to those arduous and heroic "slapped" party members, and tried his best to help the establishment and activities of "illegal organizations."</p>
<p>Liepmann's sense of justice is not only on his lips, but also hidden in his actions. And this is precisely what gives him the convenience of collecting secret news, enabling his understanding to penetrate from the surface to the inside, and making his reports more detailed and true.</p>
<p>In "Underground Fire," the beginning describes the Nazis burning the Reichstag to frame the communists for arson, and then suppressing the freedom of the people, capturing and killing their political opponents, and manipulating the election under bayonets to seize the power of dictatorship: Therefore, socialists turned to underground activities, and under the spider web of secret agents and military police, they were repeatedly smashed and failed, but regrouped three times to fight. Rascals became important officials, traitors were promoted, and some became members of the SS in order to raise marriage expenses; on the other hand, in unemployment and poverty, they carried out propaganda for their beliefs, planned riots, and engaged in anti-tyranny work. In such an atmosphere, relatives became enemies, couples turned against each other, and lovers became foes. However, revolutionaries risked danger and endured sacrifices in order to stir up the "underground fire"!</p>
<p>Conspiracy, terror, tension, tragedy, decisiveness, bravery—these are not legends, but all facts. Liepmann uses multi-faceted narratives to show the inner workings of the two forces in power and in opposition, and to reveal the origins of many events of high pressure and hard struggle, which are the result of his not taking trouble to investigate in all directions and personally participating in the work. He contacted the leaders and party groups of the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Socialist Youth League, etc., and also contacted Hitler's special envoys, Nazi spies, and SS members; he ran into the masses, secret rooms, and also entered the police department and prisons. These real experiences and insights became the rich and accurate materials for his writing.</p>
<p>In this book, there is no exaggerated description, nor imaginary supplements—these are more appropriate to put in novels—and this is "a bloody record." It writes about thugs, but does not write each one like a beast, some of them are also influenced by revolutionaries: it writes about heroes, but does not write each one like a god, they also often encounter dangers and change color in fright. This is a tragic human drama, "every thing is a fact obtained after detailed investigation," but it does indeed make people feel tragic when reading it.</p>
<p>Liepmann's writing is also very concise and skillful. He often inserts some seemingly accidental joints in the front of the book, and later the development of the facts is connected with those joints; this kind of "echoing" method is particularly thrilling, and it is also more "realistic." For some events, he did not add much descriptive explanation, but has already hinted at their causal relationship. That kind of bookkeeping-style tedious and wasteful writing is not there.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the authors of reportage in our country can pay attention to this writing attitude and technique.</p>
<p>This book now has a Chinese translation, translated by Zhu Wen. Zhu Wen's translation is fluent and smooth, worthy of the name of a masterpiece, a good translation.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Flood Zhang Eyun Encounters Misfortune</h3>
<p>— Shui Yan</p>
<p>Chen Shaolin Returns to Beiping by Tub</p>
<p>The flood in Tianjin has been heard in this city for a long time, and Zhang Eyun, Chen Shaolin, Ye Sheng’lan, Wang Shi’ying, Hou Xi’rui, Ma Fu’lu and others, who were performing at the Chinese Grand Theater in the French Concession of Tianjin, also encountered this disaster. On August 20, when the play "The Heavenly River Match" was nearing its end, with the seven-sentence verses being sung, water suddenly poured in, leveling with the stage. All the actors were terrified, and fled to the Huizhong Hotel. But the water was already reaching the roof, so Ye Sheng’lan and six others immediately hired a small boat at the price of twenty yuan per person. They took the boat to the railway station that day, and took a train back to Beiping in a state of disarray. Because the boat was small and crowded, the famous beards player Chen Shaolin couldn’t get on the boat in time, so he switched to a wooden tub, with two good swimmers to help row, and finally floated to the station, returning to Beiping at risk, which can also be said to be fortunate. It is heard that the famous female performer Zhang Eyun also fled to the roof with the crowd at that time, but because things happened suddenly, everyone was only concerned with escaping for their lives, and no one cared about her. When everyone hired a boat, Eyun was still on the top of the roof. Whether she is in mortal danger is still unknown, but the food is gone. Zhang Ling’s life is in danger!</p>
<h3>Molière Has Good Luck</h3>
<p>— Xi Tong</p>
<p>The great French comedy writer Molière has recently had good luck in Shanghai. Various drama troupes have successively staged his old man's plays, and they have all put Chinese costumes on them. The first is the "Pretentious Ladies" of the Sino-French Theater, which is a satire on the salon atmosphere in France at that time. After Mr. Feng Zhizhong changed it, it turned to mocking the milk-drinking poets of our country. Then there is the "Tartuffe" of the New Performance Theater, which satirizes religious hypocrites. Originally, the Sino-French Theater also wanted to perform "Ideal Wife" and set the background in Wuxi. Recently, the Pudong Building Xuan Palace Theater has also staged Molière's "The Miser". This is the "The Miser" translated by Gao Zhenchang before, adapted by Gu Zhongyi and Guang Sheng.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jianwu compared "The Miser" with Zheng Tingyu's "The Skinflint," which is quite insightful. There are many similar dramas and legends, such as One Wen Money Luo Meng. It is common to combine great drinking, love, greed, and anger into four dramas. The so-called greed describes misers. In terms of diction and structure, Molière likes white painting, which is not compatible with those who liked gorgeous diction at that time; his dramas are all laughter-inducing. This point is quite similar to Li Yu and Shen Qifeng in our country, and the times are very close. The difference is that Chinese comedy focuses on fame and fortune, talented scholars and beautiful women, and has no enlightenment on life: Molière mercilessly stripped off the clothes of the general goblins, making them nakedly exposed, so almost none of Molière's dramas do not cause trouble. Everyone thought that Molière was scolding themselves, so they attacked in groups. Even if Louis X called bodyguards, it was useless. When he died later, he could only hold a funeral secretly.</p>
<p>Molière has a wealth of stage experience, and the effect of "The Miser" is good. It can indeed cause laughter from the audience.</p>
<p>In terms of important actors, such as Zheng Zhong, Wu Ming, Shen Min, Zhou Qi, etc., are all very successful. The most noteworthy is the final decision to marry. Everyone advocated saving the marriage expenses and donating them to the country. As soon as the words were spoken, the audience applauded, which shows the enthusiasm of the Shanghai people for loving the country.</p>

<p>Favorite plays</p>
<p>When I was in the "Carlton" troupe, I would haphazardly play almost all kinds of roles, such as young male, clown, and supporting characters, except for painted faces. Since joining "Golden," I have specialized in playing old plays. I have performed the Hua Shan plays the most, but when I was invited to play flat roles, I would often play the Qingyi roles. Generally speaking: My favorite plays are the Qingyi plays such as "Teaching the Son," "Sacrificing to the River," and "Sacrificing to the Pagoda," which are bitter plays, and the Hua Shan plays like "Flower Field Wrong," "Making a Scene at School," and "Playing Cherry," where I play the little maid. Because the bitter plays are poignant and moving, and full of genuine emotion; the little maid's role is natural to perform a naive and lively mood, and I can give full play to it without any affectation: In other words, this kind of play is also very suitable for my age, and perhaps it will not be very suitable after a few years.</p>
<p>Daily life</p>
<p>The daily life can be said to be accustomed to mechanization: I get up at seven in the morning, and then the two Qin masters pull the erhu to warm up my voice for an hour. From nine to ten o'clock, I practice work - running around the field and the martial arts used in the Dao Ma Dan plays. In the afternoon, I learn Kunqu opera for an hour, and in the evening, I go to a nearby tutoring school to study Central English for two hours. However, if there are day plays or rehearsals of new plays, this afternoon course cannot be taken care of and often has to be abandoned.</p>
<p>The only wish</p>
<p>My only wish is to go to Beiping to learn plays from various teachers and strive for further study, which has been my wish for several years. Since leaving "Carlton" last year, my mind has been full of the idea of going to the north; at present, although the "Golden" authorities are still firmly unwilling to let me go, I am always thinking about it and determined to plan to go north to find a teacher as soon as possible to complete this wish. The planned plan is to go there for two years, still half-work, half-advise, singing plays on the one hand and learning plays on the other. Because the custom in northern theaters is that they usually perform only two or three times a week; even if I want to join a troupe, it will not hinder the work of learning plays at all.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that most people's eyes look at us play actors as lower than ordinary occupations, which is really unfair; there are many people in our play industry who have the same high level of thinking and personality, and it is inevitable that we will be subject to such erroneous discrimination, which is a great regret!</p>
<h3>Paramount Grand Theater</h3>
<p>Will stand in Jing'an Temple</p>
<p>Since the Paramount Shopping Mall was erected at the intersection of Yu Yuan Road on the side of Jing'an Temple in West Shanghai, the market has become more prosperous, but the film theaters for entertainment are still lacking. Now I have learned that Mr. Yang Cunguo, the general manager of Paramount Shopping Mall, plans to build the Paramount Grand Theater next to the Paramount Ballroom. The theater site covers an area of more than two mu, enough for more than a thousand seats. All the equipment is the latest type in the Far East. The theater is also equipped with hot and cold machines. The rest, such as the projector, sound machine, screen lighting, etc., are all perfect. It is heard that the design of the theater has been approved by the central management authorities, and construction will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Drama Society　Revives "Tears Splashed on Flowers"</h3>
<p>"Tears Splashed on Flowers" was staged three times at Carlton and Xin Guang last year. This time, the Shanghai Drama Society is said to have the intention of reviving "Tears Splashed on Flowers." And it is a four-act complete performance. According to the already announced original cast, it is very strong. For example, Chang Hai Cai played by Mo Yan, and Xiao Li played by Xu Li are very excellent. Tu Guangqi, who played Ni Yanqing successfully in "Drowning Abyss," will certainly not be weak to play Jin Shiyin. Xia Xia's Ding Xiang and Lan Lan's Mi Mi are naturally good.</p>
<p>It is said that "Tears Splashed on Flowers" will be performed from September 1. The director of the play is still the film director Wu Yonggang. He is the old director of "Tears Splashed on Flowers." Mr. Wu also directed the first performance. Then this time, "striving for perfection," the results can certainly be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Newly Built Theaters Have Superstitions Such as Opening the Door and Breaking the Stage</p>
<p>Most of the people who are theater owners in the interior are relatively prestigious figures in Anqing. The actors of the Jianghu troupe must also have this threshold, so that they will not suffer a big loss. Cao, the owner of the Yunlong Stage, is also a senior member of Anqing. At that time, he hooked up with the old actor Meng Xieqing and Meng's high apprentice Shan Deyuan. Xieqing privately learned from the famous net Huang Runfu, and his singing and white skills were very experienced. In addition to the supporting net, he was also good at martial arts and had many Guan operas. However, he was very old-fashioned and superstitious. According to the usual practice of the Pear Garden, "Do not read Geng (Geng changed to continue Jing) on the stage, and do not talk about dreams under the stage." Therefore, whenever he met someone surnamed Meng (dream and Meng have the same sound), everyone would call him "Huang Liangzi." (Based on the saying "Huang Liang One Dream") Xieqing's surname is Meng, if someone asks him his name, he will give you a string of five words "Huang Liangzi Xieqing". If you are a layman and express surprise after hearing this, then he would rather write the word Meng for you to see, but he will never say "Meng". When he first arrived at the theater, he saw that it was originally a house built on a sandy beach. This place was originally the old course of the Yellow River. When there were many rains in summer and autumn, the entire theater would be completely submerged in water. He thought this was a bit strange. The name of the garden is "Yunlong". In the season of water, the dragon is of course comfortable in the water, but the play does not need to be sung, which is equivalent to closing the door. If it is in spring and winter, there is no water around the theater. The play is of course performed, but "the dragon is trapped on the beach, and the tiger falls on the plain." These are all unlucky idioms. How could a good Yunlong Stage be built on the beach? Isn't this too ignorant? (90)</p>
