<h3>社評爭學校　　本報昨日社評，就上海敎育界最近之若干事件，析論其糾紛，蓋無窮感歎，不安緘默；復以鑒於各方之所執持，容有短長，顧致疑於是者未必竟無一非，非者未必竟無一是，揆之忠恕之道，凡居一是，亦足原情，故亦未欲就事論事，分別研求其究竟，論斷其曲值。但願當事者幡然改圖，好自爲之而已。茲請置上海近事於不論，泛論所謂爭學校。　　學校原是敎育園地，種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆。攷之爭者，非敎育之爭，非種瓜種豆之爭，乃僅爭園爭地。爭園爭地，爲權爲利。自來爭權利於園地者，輙爲不肖之子弟，不明事理之鄉愚，不顧是非曲直之土豪劣紳之流；類皆才力不足以創建，欲念惟亟於佔有，爭學校者實其儔也。若謂爲敎育，斯爭學校；爲種瓜種豆之宗信之殊，斯爲所宗信而爭學校；爭學校，儼然衛道，此欺世之讏言也。退一步而假定爭學校之動機，信如其說，則爭得學校之成效，渺茫不可知，而所以訓社會，訓學生之第一課，即爲爭取佔有之事實行動；嗚呼，此足爲訓耶！　　昨言中國社會習慣、學府行動，輒繫觀聽；茲言事實行動，將以訓社會，訓學生；夫豈過甚之言。中國文化，閱四千餘年而有其充實之本質；然所以爲此本質之基礎者，以及基礎所附麗者，乃爲尊儒者，重師道。西方推崇碩學專家，固猶中國之尊儒者；若言師道，則中國獨重。抑不　　僅庠序之內而已，事師如事君父，固矣；庠序復爲社會所尊重，敎化興焉，風氣繫焉，故一般社會之於爲師者，禮敬最恭。降至近世，師道漸替；然傳統習慣，入人至深，故不僅師生之誼，仍非泛泛，即一般社會對於學校，亦多能予以深切之同情愛護。因此習慣，我人深感於學校育之於中國，以及獻身敎育者之於中國，所處地位，所負責任，其「比重」實較他國爲高，亦較他事爲高。中國敎育界中人士，上者以淸高自喜；决者亦以淸高自鳴，有由來也。　　自尊自愛者，更僕難數。其不知敎育爲何事，不知學校爲何物，不自知師之爲師者，亦比比也。於是厠身敎育界，有如作客逆旅者；辦理學校，有如經營工廠商店者；登堂授課，有如丑角之圖博聽衆一笑者；有謀溫飽者鑽營枝棲於學校者，有謀利潤而投資股開學校者，貨眞價實爲工商所尙，冒牌影射爲百業所誅，而敎育界敗類則無所忌憚而允過之，偸工減料，粗製濫造；不妨誤人子弟於前，無虞「退貨還洋」於後，遂及期而一紙文憑，揮之門外，當然「出門不認貨」者也。生財有道，寡廉鮮恥，其有校產可刦持，餘利可染指者，鬭法鬭力以爭之；務在必得，視爲當然；喧騰遐邇，自鳴得意；其謬之甚，其醜極矣。其人不足論，其學校名譽不必問，謂教育乃神聖，師道應尊重，更所不必談；然以種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆之眞理推之，此所造就之學生，耳濡目染，師承有自。是何宗奉，是何信守，將如何立身處世，如何作爲於社會國家？此實國族之隱憂，抑猶爲他日事也；就目前言之，以中國社會習慣之繫觀聽於學府，淺識之大衆不將得印象曰，彼初識階級也，彼淸高事業也，彼冠冕堂皇，衣屨入時，見得大人先生董其事者也，「有爲者亦若是耳！」，此又非以所謂爭學校而予社會以有力之實踐敎育乎？肅清私存烟土　辦法大綱　設督辦肅清私存烟土　限五個月內辦竣違者處罰　　（重慶）六年禁烟計劃、分期分區禁種、其綏禁各縣產土、廿六年即應統收、乃因抗戰軍興、致未如期實施、原定廿九年禁絕之期、現僅有十八月、按照原定計劃、一川、廿最後綏禁各縣、已於廿七年秋季、明令提前禁種、最近蔣總裁復頒佳、侍秘渝手令、本年秋冬、絕對不准再有一株偷種、違者從重一律處以死刑、則民間私存烟土、尤應限期肅清、以作正本清源之計、孔院長爲澈底加强禁政、期收實效起見、特擬肅淸私存烟土辦法、於必要各省、設置督辦肅淸私存烟土公署、商經蔣總裁決定、尅期興辦，限於五個月內統收、嚴厲執行、澈底澄淸、不容遺漏、違者處以極刑、以示政府完成六年計劃之决心、業於四日行政院會議通過、茲探得原提案及辦法如左、　　「肅淸烟土案提案原文」查六年禁烟計劃、係分年推進、對於民間存土、規定統制收買、以冀拔本塞源、實施管制、現距二十九年禁絕之期、計僅十有餘月、若不按照原定計劃、將私存烟土、統收集中、嚴加管制、必難使之根本肅淸、迺者總裁鑒於禁絕期近、特頒手令、本年秋冬、絕對不准再有一株偷種、違者從重一律處以死刑、則今後對淤肅淸民間存土工作、尤非加緊進行、不足以收計日成功之效、惟辦理統收、在在與地方軍政有關、爲防止不肖軍警團隊、以及各地土劣販私放私、更非責成軍政機關、嚴密查禁不爲功、除雲南省產土早經該省政府統制管理、陜甘寗等省情形、正在考察議擬外，至於向來產土之川。康·黔等省、民間存土爲數尙多、於貫澈禁政、加緊肅淸工作起見、似應於各該省特設督辦肅淸私存烟土公署、督飭各行政督察專員、各縣縣長、嚴厲執行、以專責成而利推進、幷於該署內分設第一第二兩處、秘書·軍法·糾警三室、第一處長由該省民政廳長兼任第二處長由該省禁烟督查分處長兼任、本其固有職權、聯緊辦理、通力合作、俾赴事功、犯私案件、不分官民、胥由軍法室審理、其主任擬山軍法執行總監部遴派、關於統收私存烟土之檢舉查緝、及各級人員之監察、則由糾察室掌理、其主人擬由軍委會遴派、並於肅淸烟土各縣、設置監察委員會、延聘縣黨部書記長、臨時參議員及地方熱心禁烟公正士紳充任委員、執行監察任務、以杜流弊、此外各縣縣長允應嚴令督率區聯保甲長、曉論民衆、使知政府禁烟之决心、凡私藏烟土者、限期呈繳公家、按照主管機關核定價格付給、辦竣之日、並應由區聯保甲長出具並無絲毫隱漏切結、以昭核實而示體恤、依六年禁烟計劃、癮民按年齡分期傅戒、在未施限期之前、責由禁烟機關、遵照禁烟法規、憑戒烟執照配給、分期遞减、從前辦民領照登記者、應由各地方政府補行普遍登記一次、經查騐後、換發新照、免收照費、以爲配給傳戒及遞减之根據、務期禁種·禁遝禁售·禁吸四端、平流並進、貫澈到底、如限禁絕、倘有逾此肅淸定限、而尙故爲隱匿者、即以私論、沒收充公、幷加嚴懲、共包庇縱容及存私放私者、無論各級文武官吏、及土豪劣紳、均以軍法從重治罪、以昭炯戒、如此嚴密辦理、則民間存土、既可肅清、庶六年禁烟計。亦可如期達到、茲擬具肅清私存烟土辦法大綱、及督辦肅淸私存烟土公署組織規定、提請公決、「肅淸私存烟土辦法大綱」　　第一條、為貫澈六年禁烟計劃、肅清私存烟土、加緊統制起見、於必要省份、特設督辦肅淸私存烟土公署、主持辦理之、第二條、肅淸私存烟土公署、負責督飭各區行政督察專員、各縣縣長、層飭區聯保甲長、嚴厲執行、所收存土、隨時交由禁烟督察處騐收保管、其定價付款辦法另定之、第三條、督辦肅清私存烟土公署、應負責指揮軍警團隊、查緝一切私運私售事宜、第四條、肅淸私存烟土、由督辦肅淸私存燜土公署定期五個月、辦理完竣、先三個月爲辦理期間、後二個月爲檢查期間、第五條、自本辦法大綱施行之日起、絕對禁止私人採購烟土、所有已發給商人之採辦烟土證照、一律無效、並令繳銷、第六條、五個月屆滿後、如發現存土、以私論、除將烟土沒收外、按其情節、依禁烟治罪暫行條例第五條地一項「運輸販賣雅片者、無期或五年以上有期徒刑、五百元以上者死刑、」及第十九條、「沒收財產全部或一部」懲辦、如有不肖縣長·區長·聯保主任·保甲長等、通同隱匿或其他文武貪官汚吏、土豪劣紳、包庇縱容情事、依同條例第十三條「死刑」懲辦、第七條、經辦肅淸私存烟土人員、乘機舞弊者、依法加等治罪、第八條、關於肅清私存烟土費用、統由中央核撥、第九條、川康兩省夷地產土、應參照本辦法天網同時辦理之、第十條、本辦法大綱施行細則、及督辦肅清私存烟土公署組織規程、另訂之、第十一條、本辦法大綱、自各該省督辦肅淸私存烟土公署成立之日施行、（八日電）港防控部隊　組織完成　　（香港）港防空專員稱、各防空部隊、已組織完成、動員令下、卽可出發工作、燈火管制、何時舉行未定實習撲滅燒夷彈法、日內舉行、大規模防空壕及暗道等建築、已決定放棄、（九日下午專電）渝方開始　檢查壁報　　（重慶）自今日起、國民黨已開始檢查各種壁報按自抗日戰事爆發以來、華方各報、無一不被置於檢査制度之下、至　壁報之受檢査、則今猶破天荒第一决、同時、此間之新華日報自五月停版以來、卽廣事向壁報方面發展、成爲向民衆傳達消息最普通之辦法、（九日美聯社電）渝兩團體歡迎　華僑代表　　（重慶）中國國民外交協會與國際反侵運動中國分會、今日開會歡迎華僑代表、藉以增强國內外華人之關係、歡迎會席上、兩會代表報吿海外華僑之活動與貢獻、又聞兩會在廣東廣西現皆設有分會、（九日美聯社電）三民主義靑年團　靑海設辦事處　　西寗　三民主義靑年團在靑海籌設辦事處、派馬步芳爲指導員、王文俊·郭學禮·馬紹武·原春輝·鄧欽義·穆建業·王守鈕·爲幹事、並指定王文俊爲籌備主任、原春輝爲書記、（九日電）</h3>

<p>「天津事件」　及更大範圍的問題　英政府之應付內部未能一致　但對日妥協各方面咸主拒絕  （歐洲通信）　叔棣　　「天津事件」本週末張伯倫首相在英國國會裏這樣宜稱着；「英皇陛下政府是仍然希望可以當地解決的」；然而一涉及「更大範圍問題」的時候，張伯倫又接着說；「英皇陛下政府，就不得不認爲事態太嚴重了！」那末，嚴重又怎麼樣？他就跟着給下了一個註解：「那個問題，牽涉到的國家，已經不祗是英國一國，一切在中國有利害關係的國家，全都要牽進了裏面」。　　根據了這種認識，所以，這些天來以英國應付遠東局勢的舉措，是循着兩個方向，同時行進着的；（一）一再地警吿日本，告訴英國改變立塲的絕不可能；如果日本固執，那末，她自己的地位，是很危險的。所以英國很希望日本能不擴大事態，就地解决「天津事件」。（二）爲了萬一的防備，英國與美·法·之間，不獨政府方面，已經在交換着政策上的磋商；而同時三國的海軍當局，以及工·商·金融界·也在作着種種技術上的談判，凖備政府作最後決定的，提出具體的辦法。　　這些，就是自所謂「天津事件」爆發以來的英國所採應付手段的大致方向。下面是實際情形——　　（一）英政府的暫時猶豫　　連篇累牘的電訊和照片，不斷地由天　傳到了英國。英國僑民們，受到了重大而且新奇的侮辱，一切的資產，已經陷入了隨時被沒收的危險之中，這一切，皆令英國人士們感到了切膚之痛。輿論的一致激昂，已經到了一個這樣最高的程度；任何强硬的措置，—祗要不是戰爭的話—政府一定可以從人民方面，取得普遍的熱烈擁護。而有些海軍界的耍人們，竟在公然宣稱着：「這一些，日本已經等於向英國宣戰了；現在的問題，是英國敢不敢應戰」。　　雖係如此，但是放在我們眼前的，竟是這樣一件滑稽事，到今天（二十三日）日本在天津，已經封鎖了英租界八九天之久，而英國方面，還是絲毫沒有拿出切實的辦法。其實呢，無論是進一層做或不，英國的應付日本辦法，是非常之多的。其所以造成目前這種猶豫的，還是根本歸因於英政府內部的意見，目前沒有達到完全一致。　　據我所能知道的情形大概是這樣：（一）當日本宣稱要封銷天津英租界時，英國外交部接到了駐華大使寇爾及駐天津總領事占梅孫（Jamieson）的同時報吿。那時，寇兩的意見，認爲日木是在虛張聲勢，如果英國强硬應付的話，她是會退縮回去的。但占梅孫的意思，則認爲如果「程錫庚案」中四個所謂「嫌疑犯」不交給日方的話，那末，封鎖也許會終於幹出來的。這時，英外交部是採納了牠駐華大使的意見。後來，因爲英政府到底沒有採取强有力的實際步驟，日本果然宜佈了封鎖。然而，寇爾大使以後的歷决報告，仍是主張英政府採取强有力的手段，絕對不能讓步自示怯弱。（二）這一决事件，自開始以來，外相哈立法克斯，即主張完全强硬應付。他的意思，同然所謂「合作」也者，萬難談到，即使所謂「嫌疑」也者，在沒有提出充分證據前，也不能隨便交給日方的。所以當有些人向他建議，以爲祗耍交給日方以四個「嫌疑犯」之後，事情就可完結的時候，這一建議，立刻被他加以拒絕。照他的說法，自德國强佔捷克以後，所謂「强力政治」，幾乎已成了萬能，所以日本也來學樣。萬一英國再讓步，那末，後患當不堪設想。爲了表示他的决意，他立刻就請英國的貿易局（Board　of　Trade）趕緊凖備經濟裁制的各種實際方案。然而與這同時，張伯倫首相，却希望事件可以就地解決，不願擴大事態，所以他一再地發着安慰人心的演說，期待日方反省，直到目下，似乎還沒有絕望。（三）就是上面說過的貿易局，還有一部份出口商那時也不完全贊同哈立法克斯的意見，理由是：萬一實施起來，受害的，不僅是被裁制的國家，也同時給施行裁制的國家，以許多不利；常然他們那時這麽說，是假定美國不參加，恐怕蹈以前對意裁制的覆轍。　　總之，在所謂「合作造東亞新秩序」的問題上，英國絕無妥協的可能，對這一點，英國各方面目前的態度，是一致的；萬一日本固執到底的，英國必須採報復手段，對這更是一致了。那末，現在是不是已經到了採取報復手段的時機？叉到底什麽實際手段，是最有效的？—這兩點，英國內部，目前顯然還未得到結論。　　前幾天，英國雖有極少數人，曾說着這樣的話：所謂經濟裁制，美國不參加，是不會生效的。可是目前，這悲覜的理由，已經完全站不住了。因爲，經過英當局探詢美。法，兩國熊度的結果，兩國的一致答覆是；如果英國首先發動，美·法·一定加入。　　所以現在的問題，僅僅祗剩下了一個：英國到底什麼時候方可以克服她內部的猶豫。　　（二）就地解決還可能麼　　這一個問題，要是請張伯倫首相來答，那末，毫無疑義的，是「可能的」。有什麽根據呢？　　第一，據他們看，日木在天津這一决所提出所謂「合作造東亞新秩序問題」，祇是當地軍人的一意孤行，與日木政府，是沒有關係的。根據英國駐日大使克萊琪的報吿，雖然他說，關於「不擴大」的提議，他從日政府方而，得不到一點肯定的答覆；不過他以爲目前在天津的日木軍人舉動，事實上，是超出了日政府控制的範圍。因而張伯倫一流人物，就始終把這麽一個幻想放在心上：一等軍人恢復理智，那時，再通過了對日本政府的談判，不難把「天津事件」地方化，而予以解決。　　第二，照英國一般左派人們的看法，張伯倫政府所以不下決心對付日本的，僅僅爲了挽救日本的危亡而已已，因爲，萬一英國一經採取任何强有力的舉動，那末，以日本目前地位的動搖，是不難一打而倒的。這樣看法，在理論上，是十分的正確。不過，據我個人見解，目前的問題，還祇是英國如何應付日本暴力，保全自己在遠東的利益；而並沒有涉及那麽遠。現在僅僅就事實而論，英國政府的內部，却誠然有些人們，在作著這樣的推論；日本對於自己地位的危險，難道還不自覺麼？「不會的」！萬一英國有所强硬舉動，日本將陷入一敗塗地的境况，那末，難道日本對這一點還不明瞭麼？「也不會的」！因而推斷起來，日本會走極端，定要固執着要英國「合作造東亞新秩序」，把英國推到下最大決心的地步麽？「當然也不會的」！所以，他們說，常前最大的問題，就是吿訴日本，英國絕對不改變她在遠東的基本態度。這麽樣，站住了在這裹，一點也不動搖，久之？日本一定曉然於英國的不可威脅，而自行退回去的吧。於是在他們想來，「天津事件」的就地解決，將來自然是可能的了。　　（三）結論　　平心而論，對於日木這一次在天津的舉動，在英國社會各階層，我們始終沒有聽到一句怯弱的話，更沒有聽到一句以爲日本荒謬的，所謂「合作造東亞新秩序」的要求，是具着被攷慮可能的話。如果說聽到過，那末搜尋起來，唯一的一件，就是傳說一時的，前任駐日大使林德賽於日本一揚言封鎖天津租界時，那時立刻就向張伯倫首相建議，爲了表示好感，不如趕緊停止了正在進行的英。法。蘇。同盟的談判，因爲他的意見，認爲日本在天津舉措的用意，實在是想阻止英·蘇·法·同盟的談判而已。這位林德賽，上一决爲了譏刺中國難民之多，是由於「焦土政策」，因而受到了全英與論的責難。早已名揚過一時了。現在他的話，當然不會引起重視。同時，據傳他是動張伯倫立刻召回正在莫斯科進行談判的斯特蘭的，然而，英政府的決意，却反而是加緊英。法·蘇·合作談判，並目延長了斯特蘭的留俄期間。（六月廿三日寄自倫敦）江陰四郊　發現華佈吿　勸吿僞方自省　　江陰通訊、城區日僞當局、邇因經濟急迫、亟欲統制鄉鎭、以裕收入、惟近城四郊、游擊隊滿佈、待機而動、前天北門外小菜塲與東南門外、均發現華方××軍指揮官楊蔚吿淪陷區民衆書、原文頗長、其扼要數點、係整飭冒充活動隊名義、擾害人民、禁止重徵土產國貨稅、勸吿僞方人員反醒、如果棄邪反正、可從寬免究等語、並說明不准扯去此種文吿、如果査明、格殺勿論、後被日兵撕去、偶有人民前往觀看、咸遭痛打、敎育消息全國高敎師資　資格任用與待遇　（中）　民元後大學設敎授助敎等　　（二）北京政府時代　　民元、大學令規定大學設敎授助敎授、遇必要時、得延聘講師、民二、修正大學令、規定大學設正敎授·敎授·助敎授·講師、規定仍如奮制、民三、復公布直轄專門以上學校敎職員任務暫行規程、薪俸暫行規程、及任用暫行規程、對於任用、待遇及服務、詳爲規定、關於敎員資格規定較爲簡單、「以專門以上學校畢業或於某門學問具有專長者充之、」惟此項規定、僅適用於敎部直轄之專門以上學校　私立大學敎員之資格、據民二公布之私立大學規程、須有下列各款資格之一、「一、在外國大學畢業者、二、在國立大學或經敎育部認可之私立大學畢業、並積有硏究者、三、有精深之著述、經中央舉會評定之、如一時難得合格者、得延聘相當之人充之、但須是請敎育總長認可、」公私立專門學校敎員資格、除增「在外國或中國專門學校畢業者」一項而外、餘與大學之規定相同、關於各校敎員人數之多寡、依民三薪俸暫行規程各校所需敎員一由校長視學科科目之繁簡、酌擬名額及薪俸數目、授課時間、於每學年開始三個月前詳報敎育總長核定、」其規定較爲嚴格、關於敎員任用之方式、依民三公布及民六修正任用暫行規程、「大學校分科學長及預科學長、由校長就各科專任敎員中推舉三人、詳請敎育總長選任、」專任敎員、「均由校長延聘相當之人充之、但須開具詳細履歷詳經敎育總長認可、」兼任敎員聘任手續與專任同、惟只報請敎育總長備案、母須「認可」方式、叉民六公布之國立大學敎員任用及薪俸規程「正敎授·敎授·講師·外國敎員、均由校長聘任之、並呈報敎育總長」、其規定與任用暫　行規程兼任敎　員相同、而較之專任敎員則寬嚴逈異矣、敎員任期、國立大學敎員任用及薪俸規程曾規定、「正敎授助敎延聘、以一年爲試敎時期、期滿若雙方同意、得訂立長期契的、」爲大學敎員聘任期限有合理規定之開始、敎員待遇、民三薪俸暫行規程僅加概括規定、但分科學長及預科學長服務滿五年以上、確有成續者、得給全年津貼六百元、高師及專門學校、敎務主任四百元、大學專任敎員（支最高級薪）六百元、高師專門學校及大學預科專任敎員四百元、民六任用及薪俸規程、學長薪俸分爲四級、敎員分爲六級、初任職者自最低級起俸、學長非繼續任職二年、敎員非連繼續任職一年、不能進一級、任職滿若干年、若因病廢或年滿六十自請退職者、並有給予終身卹金之規定、繼續任職五年以上、並得出國考察一年以資進修、民十六、北京敎育部、歸併北京國立各校爲國立京師大學、並公布國立京師大學職員薪俸規程、規定既簡略、待遇亦較薄、惟實行未久、北京政府即已解體、實際上並未發生若干效力、雷沛鴻　繼任桂敎廳長　　（桂林通訊）廣西敎育廳長原爲邱昌渭氏、經行政院四一九次會議任命邱氏擔任廣西民政廳長、遺缺則由雷沛鴻氏紀任、浙江大學在龍泉　設浙東分校　校址已堪定城南坊下　招考新生一百五十名　　（麗水通訊）國立浙江大學、爲便利東南各省高中畢業生升學起見、近奉敎育部令、在浙江龍泉籌設浙東分校、今春曾由鄭敎務長、陳叔諒敎授來浙接洽並訪問、近更山該校李絜非氏、來浙籌備、當在永康縣商會內設立簫備處、以便籌措設備、及答復各方關於一切訪問事宜、至關於分校校址、最近已勘定龍泉城南五里許之坊下、該地位居由塢、環境淸幽、校舍爲曾姓三樓大厦、新俊寬敞、足敷應用、又該校近已呈准敎育部、單獨在浙招新生一百五十名、考試地點、擬設永康麗水等地、考試時間、亦已定於本月內辦理、）浙東分校招收一年級新生百名、先修班學生五十名、至宜山本部、大抵仍遵照敎部國立各院校統一招生辦法辦理、更爲便利各方明瞭該校近年辦理經過起見、特編有「浙江大學要覽」及「浙江大學西遷紀實小册兩種、即可出版、凡欲索閱者、請附郵票三分、通函永康商會內浙江大學浙東分校籌備處、或麗水民敎館許振東君處、即可分別贈閱云、第一屆　信誼文課獎學金給獎禮　文課琳琅滿目美不勝收　得獎眉飛色舞異常光榮　雨　　年來國事蜩螗、國粹頽衰、自科學興起、科舉廢止以來、國文一項、也就很少有人注意到、今年四月杪的時候、信誼化學製藥廠、舉行信誼文課應選、招待上海市中小學校校長、於四馬路中央西菜社、到各學校校長的五百餘位、由林康侯袁履登潘仰堯諸聞人蒞臨演說、盛况空前、袁履登君他自己原是一位苦學的成功者、他會經說過他幼時、藉獎學金就學的一番歷史、所以他對於這决信誼文課的獎學金、是分外起勁、特別感覺到有與趣、　　文課是五月初開始微文、六月底截止繳卷、參加應選者、手續很爲簡單、只要持有食母生空盒一只、就可領到文卷一份、貧寒子弟無力參加的、由該廠贈、送空盒、托各該校校

<p>經濟專刋半年來上海經濟之回顧  潘文安　　過去半年來之上海經濟，頗多足述者。先就金融市塲方面言：固莫不皆知發生資金充斥，及投機　起之兩大病態。　　隨人口偏集上海租界區之結果，內地存款，皆挾之而俱來。然因戰時人心易動，極少作定期之存儲，故銀錢業所收之存款雖多，皆未敢作固定之投資；勉爲其難者，亦不過投於地產業與公私債券股票耳。職是之故，游資汜濫，金融鬆弛，銀錢業之拆息乃得穩定不動。惟在端節之前，適常財部實施新安定金融辦法：限制提取存款者，每週至多不得超過支付五百元現鈔。因此銀根驟緊，息市昂騰，而以匯劃票之貼水率高漲允爲驚人。嗣以財部接受供給法幣之要求，與銀錢業創設「同業匯劃證」，立意改革匯劃制度之流弊，始逐漸回小，茲將半年來上海銀錢業之拆息及貼現率之變動，列表示之。　　錢業　匯劃　國幣　匯劃　　拆息　公單　公單　貼水　　今年一月　二·八三　二〇·〇〇　二五·〇〇　三五·一三　　二月　九·七一　二〇·〇〇　二五·〇〇　三五·五四　　三月　一〇·〇四　二〇·〇〇　二五〇〇　四八·一二　　四月　一〇·〇〇　二〇·〇〇　二五·〇〇　四九·一八　　五月　一〇·五〇　二〇·〇〇二五·〇〇　四七·八〇　　六月　一六·六三　二三·七五　六八·九三　　去年六月　一〇·〇〇　二〇·〇〇　二〇·〇〇　五三·三〇　　（註）皆係各該月每日平均行市錢業拆息者　　每千元日息計公單拆息亦然，惟前者　　係錢業公會所定，後者係票據交換所　　掛牌，匯劃貼水係每千元換法稱時應　　金利市塲雖如是穩定，但票據交換量却與時俱增。此正足以反映游資充斥，故由票據交換所表示之通貨流通量雖增，而仍不足以搖撼比較低利之息市。游資旣屬充斥，而票據交換量仍在激增，則此種激增之理由，要在商業活動之亢進，與投機事業之劇烈兩端。依目前上海之經濟現象言。。貿易額雖在激增，究不若投機活動之更足以影響票據市塲。試觀每當外匯，現金，內債，紗花等等黑市塲變動愈劇，則票據交換額之激增亦必愈烈，即其明證。試先觀過去六個月上海銀行業票據交換額之變遷，列表比較如决此：　　（註）印係二至二十四日止累計數　　自財部實施再限制提取現鈔存款，並重用匯劃票據後；上海銀錢兩業公會，聯合中外金融機關及市商會，決定共同施行新匯劃制度；發行「同業匯劃證」以緩和市塲籌碼因限提存款而發生之緊縮狀態，同時藉以消弭匯劃票據之貼水高潮，此項辦法，因取得中外金融界之合作，故必能暢行無阻。故可推斷今後之票據交換額尙有繼長增高之可能。　　商業活動之亢進及投機性　　前已言之：票據交換額之激增，不外由於商業活動之亢進與投機行動之發達。而以後者允爲重要，此固已盡人皆知者矣，然其程度如何？尙待作進一步之觀察。　　試以本市之對外貿易以爲觀察商業活動之一種根據，則本年首六個月之貿易總値，無不較去年同期大量激急增加，且常呈躍進之勢。有如决表（單位國幣元）　　當然：在此等交易中，亦包括於正常之商業需要在內，允其對於物品方面爲然，故米可一概而論。惟各月交易量相差如是之鉅，自非受供需法則之自然變動所支配。因供需關係之變動，依理自有其規律故也。　　促成投機之主要理由，大致爲：（一）對於法幣認識不足，故其投機活動，實具逃避資金之作用．（二）游資充斥，而又以爲別無可靠之投資機會。（三）戰時人心易動，故皆不欲使其資金，投放於不易周旋之塲所。（四）戰時物價之增漲，原屬不可避免之事，加以滙市又不斷變動，貨運叉時斷時續，故囤儲以備居奇者爲數允衆，此皆不待言之矣。　　半年來之外匯暗市　　上海外滙暗市，自去秋九月出現八便士之低水準後，大體上已臻穩定；本年以來，因外滙平準基金之設立與操作，益見堅固。此固由於法幣信用之健實，然亦不無得力於當局暗中之維持。爲安定戰時金融計，固有維持黑市匯率之必要，然就國民經濟之整個利害言，則頗足疵議者，如公開市塲之匯價穩定，俾某方得自由套取法幣之外滙基金，且可不受匯價波動之損失，此其一。所謂維持匯價，實即儘量供給外匯予黑市，無論外匯基金如何雄厚，究屬　　今年之貿易總値去年之貿易總値　　貿易値躍增之間，得力於匯價下降與物價上漲者定必甚大。雖然，貿易量之實際增加率雖不致如是急劇，但亦在激增之中，乃係不可否認之事。試問其故，由於人口增加，果不失爲理由之一·三要者，恐尙在於進口商之囤儲，以避免滙價變化後之損失歟？是以在正常商業活動中，實亦具有投機性在內，惟難於加以分辨耳！　　投機市場之蓬勃　　欲觀察投機活動之程度，莫如着眼於現金，內債，紗，花，乃至麵粉，黃豆，豆油，豆餅等等之黑交易。此等黑市塲價格之暴漲不休，已足想見其超乎供需之自然法則的束縛，而實由游資之　集所致。然尙不及就其各該黑交易之交易量加以觀察，更可得一明確之事實。惟此項材料，取得至非易事。姑根據半年來各日報載之種種零星材料，而加以結算，則其逐月激增之高度，尙出一般人意想之外者。此項基本材料，正確性固成問題，但與實際上米必相差過遠。惟報載之各項數量單位，殊非一致。而以黃豆，豆油，豆餅等允爲複雜，故吾人非一一加以化合不可。　　下表所列，業經筆者根據各該業之習慣，一一加以化合而得，故棉花一律以擔爲單位，按每一二五斤，每件二六〇斤折合之。黃豆以包爲單位，按每車三二〇包，每包一四〇斤馬折合，豆油則或用件計，或用簍計，或用計，或用聽計，而簍則叉隨各地而不同，如大連者三五〇斤天秤，木廠者爲三三〇司馬。故概折爲元，以免含混，至於現金交易，可謂純屬投機，以其價格變化甚鉅，故以成交條數十兩，按各日收盤價折合成元。惟在一至三月間，則將各該月成交總條數，依各該月收盤平均價折合之。　　上海投機塲之各月成交數量比較危險。况某方旣在黑市上時來套買，此種供給，實即資敵；此共二。縱有維持匯市之必要，但得先問應維持匯價於何種水凖？不待言：此種水凖，應具有調整國際收支，改善國際貿易之性能，庶合中選資格。然自出現對英八便士之水準後，當初確似已低過匯兌購買力平價，故頗有抑制進口之效。但今春後入超之繼長增高，乃在證明此種水準，業已失去其抑制進口之力，若復繼續維持，顯於國民經濟不利。此其三。試觀過去半年內上海對外貿易入超額激增之烈，雖非八便士匯率之罪；惟八便士匯率之不足取，得以此現象而獲得明證。　　半年來上海對外貿易月別入超額　　進口値與入超値之絕對數及相對數，皆在大增特增。此種現象，能不迅謀設法改善，則非特减損國家寳貴之外匯資源力，抑且有摧毀聲個國民經濟之危險。况在此大量之入口中，大部份尙供某方之用。某方因其國內外匯枯竭，無法充分購取其所需之原料。允其彼之紡織工業方面，所需原料，皆仰給於海外。但在其外匯統制乃至貿易統制下，原棉輸入，大受限制。故邇來常在中國淪陷區內搜括法幣，而後在滬套取外匯以輸入棉花，而後再運至其本國。某方之所以能作此「借體還魂」之法術者，全在上海外匯黑市維持自由供給之原因。此種詭計，一經察覺，中英平凖基金委員會乃有六月七日斷然停止外匯供給之非常措施。停止供給之結果，黑脾匯率，果已驟起跌風，但降至六便士半以下即自然回昇，從而即又自然穩定於六便半至五七便士之間，在此劇烈變動之初，市塲人心不免大受衝動，今則咸佩常局此舉措置之得宜。蓋經此措置，非特已重造一較低之匯率藉以拘束輸入，且將某方最近在滬向外定購大批棉花之計劃完全打破。故今决外匯之變動，純係國家政策變史之結果，非市塲本身變動之後果，此非加以區別不可者也。　　過去半年上海外滙暗盤　　（註）英匯係國幣一元合便士餘皆係國幣百元合計外幣數。　　但欲謀一國戰時外匯之穩定，除振興輸出，抑制輸入，調整國際收支，作根本之圖外，對於外匯之供需，仍非加以適當之分配不可，否則，至少無法避免將寳貴之外匯，流用於不正當之消費，允其在淪陷區域之上海，更無法避免某方之套取。此種漏巵，若不杜塞，前途仍未可樂觀。　　之初，財部當局原期藉匯劃制度之施行，以封鎖國內資金之外流，免爲他人之利用，今因匯劃可以貼現，此制即失其效用。上海銀錢業公會最近倡行之「同業匯劃證」，或足以補救此種缺憾。但難者在此證向內地採辦土產之能力，能吾伸入淪陷區域。萬一不能，則向淪陷區採貨，仍需法幣，結果某方尙有來滬套買外匯之充分可能。而且欲避免此證之不發生貼現投機，亦將因此而陷於不可能之境。　　最近，財部已决定實施統制進口貿易，凡屬不急不需之奢侈消耗品，概在禁止人口之例。且對核准供給之進口外匯，加微外匯平衡費。前者旨在調整國際收支，行之有效，當能給予匯市以良好影響。後者之性質亦然，惟尙具貶抑法幣對外價値，使與外匯黑市之匯率相配合之一點作用存在其間，甚或財部有意消减外匯黑市之先聲。因對核准供給之進口外匯，加微外匯平衡費之結果，則進口商所付之實際匯價，即與黑市塲者相等。今日之外匯黑市，實際仍在財部維持之中，今後財部可將維持黑市塲之能力，移作供給法定市塲核准者之用。法定市塲供給增大，黑市塲勢必易於淘汰。於是黑市塲之外匯供給，無形中已受財部之控制。昔日之妄動，當得因此而减免之歟？　　半年來之現金暗市　　上海標金市塲，向爲投機者麕集之處，隨滬戰而停歇後，乃出現今日之現金黑市。所謂「現金」，意指僅做現貨交易；實則亦未會無期貨交易在內，惟更爲隱藏耳。故今日之現金市塲，即昔日標金市塲之替身；換言之；一十足之投機市塲耳。　　投機於現金者，除卜取買空賣空間之差額利益外，大半作爲逃避資金之一種方法。故每當外滙市塲發生變動，現金市塲即如影之隨形，且是靑出於藍，較匯市之變動時更形劇烈。如前所述：過去半年問之匯市，大體上堪稱穩定，而倫敦之金市，亦不失爲安定之局，但上海之現金市塲，竟仍時起漲風，不可向邇，而以實施新外滙政策以來爲允烈，今且已昇達二千五六百元之高峯，並一度竟躍出二千七百零二元之亘古未有的最高價，如純以此爲逃避資金之一種手段者，則其愚，誠不可及矣。　　半年來之內債案市　　內債市塲之榮辱，原可視爲國家財政信用强弱之反映；但又以客覜條件不變爲條件。本年以來，上海內債暗市，曾有兩度劇變。第一决在年初，因財部有遷渝給付到期本息之計劃傳出後發生；嗣因改採在滬分期支付而始吿平息。其後各債即月月向榮，頻創開戰以來之最高紀錄。在六月十三日且達於頂點。　　同月十九日，電傳財部對關稅担保之統一各債，以稅款彼奪，亦有停止墊付之說。或謂今後到期之本息，將槪用滙劃給付、於是各債又一致狂瀉，廿一日又接財部再度限制提取現鈔存款之電令，於是銀根驟緊，幾陷人不能交易之境；從而益益加强跌風，將五個月來漲起之成績，幾一掃而空，只得暫時停市，靜待籌碼問題之解決，初定停業二天，後決展延至七月四日與銀行結束後同時復業，茲先將本年來各債暗市之變化列表比較如决（單位元）　　投機於現金者，除卜取買空賣空間之差額　　本年兩度之劇變，顯然皆因國家變更政策而使然，與自然降落情形不同。且政策變更之方向，莫不皆謀防止所發公債本息之資金，發生惡劣之作用。。如流用於投機，或被他人利用以套取外匯。中國因未實施資金統制，而公債投資人又大半皆在上海，上海旣在游資充斥時期，則移渝發付本息，及其後實行之分期付款辦法，顯然在避免上海之資金市塲，不致以巨額公債本息之流入，而加强今日之投機。與債信問題絕對無關，且由政府能放棄原議，接受持票人之要求，而仍維持在滬發付之舊例，益足證當局維持債信之決心。至於今决所傳種種，尙米證實。延債雖爲戰爭國家應有之對策，非中國獨有，惟公債基金被奪，究未可恃爲變更政策之理山。因此非公價持票人之責任，公債持票人無代人受過之理，雖然，國家之利害，亦即民衆之利害：而民衆之利害，亦即國家之利害，故彼此必需相互體恤，不能顧此失彼：而持票人允應以國家之利害爲前提，不能徒以私利所在，私權所在，即不顧一切，任意要挾。况持票人中，頗多爲銀錢業法人，若欲逃避變更公債政策而將感受不便，即爭先拋售，以致掀起跌風，則木身即先受其禍，不智孰　　　半年來之商品界　　回顧過去牛年來之上海商品市塲，顯呈一大危機，即某方已在展開其龍斷與操縱之手段是，商人不察，不共謀聯合抗禦，而唯私利是爭，終於任人壟斷成功，各貨乃先後出乎情理而暴漲。　　個中原因：不外乎上海租界區內，僅有若干輕工業及農產加工工業之生產設備，淪陷區內之加工業生產，早在某某方手中運轉：生產總量，遠較租界區內爲大。故在供給市場上，本身已具壟斷之力，况所有農產及原料

<p>法律言論票據上本票名稱之沿革  查人偉　　我國票據法未施行前，各地票據旣無定式，且名稱亦至不一律，如現行票據法上規定之本票一項，與　時票據牲質相比照，即有莊票期票存票憑票等種種所在各異之稱謂，皆隨出票人之意思，及就地之舊習，信筆記載，漫無標準，至前淸憲政編查館設立，始着手於票據法之編訂，（出日人志田鉀太郞手故沿用日名手形法）其規定票據種類，僅有匯票期票兩種，所稱期票，即等於現行票據法上之本票，其定義據草案第九十二條所載「票據上表示一定金額向一定之人付款而爲單純之訂的者曰期票」，然其爲無條件担任支付乎，（現行票據法第一一七條第一項第叫款關於本票之規定）抑爲無條件支付之委託乎，（現行票據法第一二一條第一項第五款關於支票之規定）旣未明定，則又似但視票據上所表示一定之人，而明其責任，發行人爲担任支付可，（等於本票）由其他付款人支付之委託亦可，（等於支票）並包有支票性質在內，其立法技術，未盡完備，至修訂法律館重訂草案，比較周密，乃有匯票支票本票之分別規定，其對於本票原案理由，謂「本條定本票之發行及款式，此與匯票大略相同，惟所異者有三，（一）本票爲自己的付之證券，故無委託文句，（二）本票之發行人，即爲付款人，故不列付款人之記載，（三）本票係自己發行自己付款，故除於票上有反對記載外，即視發行地爲付款地」，該館草案修訂凡五决，除第三决將本票曾改爲期票外，其餘第二第四第五三次草案，皆仍用第一次本票名詞，民國十七年七月，工商部工商法規委員會成立，經委員徐寄廎氏提議繼續起草票據法草案，乃有該會第一次票據法之產生，其規定亦稱本票，又經工商部另聘專任委員詳加審查，擬定新案，呈請行政院轉送立法院審議，其本票名稱，改用憑票，經立法院長時間之審查討論，乃成今日之法規，仍用本票名稱，呈送中央政治會議議决通過，交由國民政府於十八年十月三十日公布施行，於是本票名稱，乃經確定，凡從前習慣上所稱莊票期票存票憑票……等等名稱，不復有票據法上之價値，因依票據法第一一七條規定，本票應記載事項，其一即爲須「表明其爲本票之文字」，而同法第八條載「欠缺本法所規定之票據法上應記事項之一者其票據爲無效」也，該法施行雖經十年，就不佞辦案經騐，一般當事人甚或法界人士尙或誤認債務人所立之債權證明書據，係用憑票或期票字樣，以旣屬本人所立，即視爲票據法上之本票，對於票據法上規定本票所應具備之要件，未加以審查者，此蓋相沿習慣用語，有以誤之也，緣爲述其沿革，以闡明立法者對於本票之意旨焉。研究與批評「職務保證」保證人責任之研討  周鯤　　値茲非常時期，失業人羣，多如過江之鯽，遇有就業機會，莫不思捷足先得，惟謀事難，覓保亦難，因社會普通人士，對於充當保證人一節，莫不視爲畏途，此雖因普通人士，對於保證人之責任，未能十分明瞭，半亦由於一般雇用人或機關所備之保證書，對於保證人之責任，過於苛刻所致，此種現象，殊非社會之福。　　關於職務保證，我國民法，並無特別規定，除適用債編中關於保證（民法第七三九條以下）之一般規定外，仍可就當事人之需要而自由訂定，蓋立法意旨，民法係採取自由放任主義，不事干涉，茲將法律上關於職務保證之性質範園效力，的略分述於后。　　職務保證之性質，所謂職務保證者，即保證人對於債權人（即僱用人或機關）積極的保證債務人（即受僱人）之體格品性技能均堪勝任其職務，消極的担保將來債務人如因執行業務故意或過失所加於債權人之損害，如舛誤宕款舞弊等等，均負賠償之責。　　保證契的，僅因意思表示之合致即成立，故保證爲諾成契的，亦爲不要式契的，換言之，即雖未塡具保證書，而僅爲口頭之担保，亦可成立。　　職務保證之範圍，保證債務之限度，當事人如有的定，則從其約定，吾則，須包含全部損害賠償違的金及利息等在內，例如保額的定一千元，則僅以一千元爲限，否則，即係無限性質。　　被保證人之地位，係以訂立保證契的時爲準，以後其地位如顯有變動時，保證人對其地位變動後所生損害，自不負賠償之責，例如保證時係一極小之營業員，嗣後升任爲出納主任或經理所生損害，保證人得不負責任。　　保證責任如定有期間者，則從其期間，如未定有期間者，保證人得隨時通知債權人終止契的，通知後，被保證人所發生之損害，保證人即不負賠償之責。　　職務保證之效力。——保證爲純然担保主債務之從債務，故係補充性質，即被保證人不履行債務時，保證人始負代償之責。　　保證人享有先訴抗辯權，即保證人於債權人未就主債務人之財產强制執行而無效果前，對於債權人得拒絕淸償之抗辯，然有下列情形之一者，此項權利，即吿喪失，（一）保證人已拋棄先訴抗辯權，（二）主債務人之住居所變更，致求償發生困難，（三）主債務人受破產宣吿，（四）主債務人之財產不足清償其債務。　　保證人享有代位權，即保證人向債權人爲淸償後，得就債權人對於主債務人之債權，代位行使其權利，換言之，即此項債權，因代爲淸償而移轉於保證人，其效力與債權讓與相同，惟代位權行使之範圍，不得超過其代爲淸償之限度，例如保證人以八百元代主債務人償訖千元債務，行使代位權時，亦僅能求償八百元爲限，不得請求千元。　　綜上觀之，我國法律上所規定保證人之權責，並不過大，惟今工商界之一部分較大商號或公司，關於僱用職員之保證書，類皆有預先訂就之格式，對於保證人之責任，規定頗嚴，大抵包括下列數點。　　（一）保證人拋棄先訴抗辯權　　（二）被保職員之職務，雖有變動，保證人始終負責。　　（三）保證人對於保證債務，負無限責任。　　（四）出具之保證書，並無期限，故始終有效。　　似此訂定，則此種保證契的，不僅保證人之責任，頗具危險性，設保證人亦無力淸償時，則僱用人方面，亦不能盡收保證之功效。　　故管見以爲職務保證書內，關於保證人之責任，最好定一相當數額及一相當期間。前者如承保一千元或二千元，後者如定一年或二年更換保證書一次，在僱用人方面，即職員職務有升遷時，亦可於更換保證書時，遞加其担保額，而職員方面，則保證人較易覓得，並因每年或間年須更換保證書，必更能兢業自持，在保證人方面，則因責任有限，更易承諾，即一人資力不足勝任全部時。亦可分保一部分責任，界限甚淸，更因須換保加保，對於被保人平日之品性行爲，必更多注意，且有考慮伸縮之餘地。　　聞此兩項辦法，我國郵政局之服務人員保證書內，即有此種規定，特提出之，藉供工商企業當局之採擇焉。自訴與被害人之關係  穆緯均　　被害人如何利用自訴程序—　　吾國往昔刑事訴訟，僅有類如刑事訴訟法中所謂公訴一種，凡刑事案件，犯罪之被害人，僅能吿訴，並無起訴權。此實不足以貫澈立法保護個人法益之旨趣；故現行刑事訴訟法，依照中央政治會議所定之原則規定：除公訴程序外，凡犯罪之被害人，有行爲能力者，均得提起自訴。（見刑事訴訟法第三一一條。）惟何種犯罪始得提起自訴，現行刑事訴訟法並無明文限制；雖較舊刑事訴訟法，限於初級法院管轄之直接侵害個人法益之罪及吿訴乃論之罪，始得自訴者之範圍爲廣，然被害人提起自訴，亦須具備一定之要件。故在何種情形之下，得提起自訴，何種情形之下，僅得吿訴於檢察官請求其提起公訴，此爲一般人民所不甚明瞭者；以致嘗見被害人提起自訴，結果遭不受理，而須另行吿訴，請求提起公訴也。茲先就公訴自訴略示區別，再將提起自訴之要件舉述如左：　　公訴以檢察官爲原吿，詳言之，即檢察官因吿訴，吿發，自首，請求，或其他情事，知有犯罪嫌疑者，應即偵查犯人及證據，就偵查所得之證據，認被吿有充分犯罪嫌疑時，而提起之刑事訴訟也。（在上海租界兩特區法院，因有協定關係，刑事案件中，僅內亂罪，外患罪，妨害國交罪，瀆職罪，妨害公務罪，妨害投票罪，妨害秩序罪，脫逃罪，等得由檢察官偵查起訴，但已經租界行政當局起訴者，檢察官無庸再行起訴，其他案件，概由租界行政當局偵查起訴。）　　自訴，即被害人自行具狀，向有管轄權之法院，對於加害人提起之刑事訴訟。　　依刑事訴訟法第三一一條之規定『犯罪之被害人得提起自訴，但以有行爲能力者爲限。』故提起自訴，須具備二積極要件：（一）自訴人須爲犯罪之被害人。—所謂被害人，依最高法院二十年上字五五號判例，乃指因犯罪行爲直接受有損害之人而言。例如在傷害罪之塲合，僅受傷人始得提起目訴，受傷人之父母或配偶，在精神上雖或遭受痛苦，然僅得吿訴請求提起公訴，而不得提起自訴，因其非犯罪之直接被害人之故也。基此理由，則在殺人旣遂之案件，僅有公訴而無自訴，蓋直接被害人已死亡而不得爲訴訟當事人矣。又如僞證罪之案件，亦不得提起自訴，蓋僞證罪所侵害者，係國家之審判權，直接被害人爲國家，而非個人也。（二）自訴人須有行爲能力。—所謂有行爲能力者，依照民法之規定，係指滿二十歲之成年人，以及未成年而已結婚之人而言。若被害人爲未成年，而叉未結婚者，或爲禁治產人時，不得爲自訴之主體而提起自訴。依舊刑事訴訟法之規定，被害人之法定代理人，保佐人，配偶，或其他親屬，亦得提起自訴，但現行刑事訴訟法，已將此項規定刪去，則凡被害人爲無行爲能力者時，僅得有吿訴權之人，吿訴請求履行公訴程序也。　　被害人提起自訴，除具備上述二積極耍件外，更須具備消極要件；（一）依刑事訴訟法第三一三條之規定「對於直系尊親屬或配偶不得提起自訴。」即須犯罪人非被害人之直系尊親屬或配偶，方得提起自訴，蓋若許對直系尊親屬提起自訴，未免違背我國傳統之倫理觀念，驚世駭俗，故法律特設限制條文，所稱直系尊親屬，依二十六年院字一六八五號解釋，包括直系血親尊親屬及直系姻親尊親屬。至配偶之間，如許適用自訴，必致攻擊防禦，對簿法庭，影響家庭幸福，殊非所宜，故亦限制之。因之被害人對其尊親屬或配偶之犯罪，僅得告訴，而不能自訴也。（二）依刑事訴訟法第三一四條之規定，「吿訴或請求乃論之罪，已不得爲吿訴或請求者，不得再行自訴。」故如已逾吿訴期間者，或吿訴已經撤回者，被害人不得提起自訴，蓋依刑事訴訟法第二一六條第一項之規定，一吿訴乃論之罪，其吿訴應自得爲吿訴之人，知悉犯人之時起，於六個月內爲之。」第二一七條之規定，「吿訴乃論之罪，告訴人於第一審辯論終結前，得撤回其吿訴，……撤回吿訴之人，不得再行吿訴。」如被害人竟仍提起目訴，法院應論知不受理之判決。（見刑事訴訟法第三二六條。）（三）依刑事訴訟法第三一五條第一項之規定，「同一案件經檢察官終結偵查者，不得再行自訴。」至於終結偵査乏結果，無論起訴與吾，皆不得自訴；故被害人提起自訴，須在檢察官偵查終結前，吾則法院亦應諭知不受理之判決。（見刑事訴訟法第三二六條。）（未完）法制要聞巡廻審判推事支俸辦法　　二十八年一月二十八日司法行政部公布　　一·巡廻審判推事之俸給，另籌專款支給之。　　二·巡廻審判推事仍叙原俸。　　三·巡廻審判推事之補助俸，定爲月給一百元至二百五十元，以五十元爲一級，由司法行政部按其成績及資歷酌量核叙。　　四·巡廻審判推事之原俸及補助俸，應依照國民政府規定之緊縮通案，按八成發　　五·巡廻審判推事俸給之全部或一部，得指定匯款處所，由司法行政部或令飭高等，法院按月匯寄。　　六·巡廻審判推事在巡廻區域內，得按實開支旅費。　　七·本辦法自公布之日施行。裁判輯要不動產租賃押金返還請求權　　四川高等法院以成都地方法院對於不動產租賃押金返還請求權有所疑義呈請解釋。經司法院以院字第一八四三號（二十八年二月六日）指令謂；「甲將出租與乙之不動產抵押於丙後，復因丙行使抵押權，致將該不動產拍賣於丁，倘該不動產已由甲交付於乙，乙並已付有押金，除當事人間關於終止租的返還押金，另訂特的外，則不問丁於受讓時，是吾向甲受有乙之押金，及會吾由賣價內扣除，依民法第四百二十五條之規定，乙自得向丁爲返還之請求。至丁所還之押金，如事前未於賣價內扣除，其得向甲求償，自不待言。　　調解或支付命令之聲請視爲已起訴者除聲請時所征之裁判費予以扣除外應另征裁判費薄鑄律師前以調解不成立而正式起訴之案件，繳納裁判費時，應遵院令扣除聲請調解時所繳之裁判費一節曾提案於上海律師公會。（原文見本刊第六期）經該會轉呈上海特一二法院去後，茲悉上海特二法院以第一二一六號指令該會云：「呈悉，業經據情呈奉江蘇高等法院第三分院指令第三五六號略開：「查調解或支付命令之聲請，視爲已起訴者，仍應另征裁判費，惟聲請時所征之裁判費應予扣除；業經轉奉司法院訓字第六七四號訓令遵辦在案。着即令知並轉

<p>自由談招牌  莫邪　　說起招牌，便使人有越老越値錢之感，因爲如果不是貨眞價實，這招牌又何從老得起來呢！於是凡有招牌的，都挖空了心思，呌牠老起來。　　最普通的方法是，老實不客氣，雖然今天新開張，馬上掛上「百年老店」的招牌。只要大胆，誰來干涉呢！否則至少也可以自稱「起首老店，並無分出」因爲今天新開張，非「起首」而何？久而久之，自然有「老店」之望，預支一下，有何不可？决之是戤老店的牌頭，張小泉，陸稿薦…有例可援，實在也是速老之一法。　　招牌速老法中最妙的是打官司。據說，有兄弟二人，各開一爿店，用同樣的祖遺招牌，而彼此攻訐其假，以致官司打得終年累月不得歇的。兩家的至好，頗想爲之調解，賢昆仲却異口同聲說，他們是在宜傳其老招牌，這官司不能不打下去。還有一個人開了兩爿店，用同樣的招牌，彼此自　老店，而駡對方爲冒牌，這種作風，也有相當的成功，因爲人們不論相信那一爿老招牌，都入了他的彀中。至於眞正因冒牌而吃官司，以致被禁止而換招牌的，自然是笨人笨事，只有呌聰明人笑掉牙齒。　　當今之世，木來只注重招牌的老，並不注重貨色的老。「掛羊頭賣狗肉」，原是常見的把戲；「說眞方賣假藥」，也到處可見。商人重利；利之所在，不怕赴湯蹈火，爲了要在剪刀上賺錢，儘可姓張，要在猪玀身上賺錢，儘可姓陸，凡此極輕鬆的事情何樂而不爲之呢！　　據我所知，就是孔老二，也很喜歡掮掮前人的老招牌，不是麼：「言必稱堯舜」？此後，因從「孔家店」三字成了招脾之後，一般鵝行鵝步之徒，隨時隨地捧出「大成至聖先師」來，以爲招搖之具，更是普遍的現象。聖人和讀書人尙且如此，那又何怪於生意人！　　然而招牌以老爲貴，當是只知其一，不以新爲貴，就是不知其二。商人或讀書人，似乎還該再加硏究才是。　　以同業的商店而論：往往你出了一種商品，他便照樣也出一種，却換個名稱，誰不標新立異，各有千秋，而又誰不大賺特賺，各得其所？可是按按實際，誰又不知道他們的「換湯不換藥　呢？同樣，在同一個地點，開辦同一性質的娛樂事業，而今天換一個招牌，明天換一個招牌，居然天天都會滿坑滿谷的擠着。　　再說學問吧：今天甲學者，發明一個新學說，招到一大批信徒，明天乙學者，發明一種新主義，也招到了一大批的門人，雖然嘴是兩層皮，翻來翻去都可以說，雖然文人之筆，無所不能，可以歌頌，也可以誅伐，所謂學說與主義，按之實際，也不過是這麽一會事，惟其花樣翻新，就使人耳目一新，而信徒與門人，就肯爲之打得頭破血流了。你不信麼一近代產物法西斯主義，納粹主義，甚至共產主義，看牠們的運用者是獨裁者，是要解決民生疾苦，到底有什麽絕對不同呢？然而內容是內容，招牌是招牌，招牌是新的，新的招牌成功了。　　歸納起來，我就不相信招牌不論新舊，有什麼重要和必要，反之，或者我還討厭牠的欺人騙人，以致誤人陷人。我很想打倒一切的招牌，將牠們丟到毛厠裏去——　　然而不不，我到底不能打倒一切的招脾，有幾種招牌我是願意保存的，計開：一，惡狗頸下的「鶴膝」；二，無常鬼頭上的「一見生財」高帽子；三，由世界公贈某種國家的「侵略國」。要是連這些招牌都取消，未免害人不淺了，阿彌陀佛，我不敢如此作孽！以農立國以武術國  辛戈不平凡的莊稼漢  聖旦　　——戰地追記　　天剛才有點亮，砲聲又在咆哮了，聽說已經把幾個重要據點奪了回來，前錢正在順利地進展。當我們離開稻草堆的時候，老農已在灶下煮粥了；松柴的火燄從灶肚裏吐出來，映着那皺紋密布的臉孔。他的確是一位典型的莊稼漢，「日出而作，日入而息」，那麼克勤克儉地生活着。他有二十多畝水田，五間瓦房，在周圍十里內，也算得「小康之家」了。但老姚對他始終表現着懷疑的態度，彷彿存了什麽戒心似的，時常把眼光在他身上搜索着；因爲像這樣年逾半百的莊稼漢，照例是渾渾噩噩的，而他的政治意識，却特別堅强，深刻，便不能不認爲罕有的奇蹟。　　「也許是對方的一名問諜，要不然，人家都跑光了，他還行所無事的留在這裏？」這就是引起老姚懷疑的理由。　　「不，不，他是多麽慈祥的莊稼漢啊！」吳小姐反駁說。　　「這就是間諜的掩護，你能担保他沒有作用—」小沈顯然同意着老姚的推測，開始跟大家爭辯起來。　　最後，疑團終於打開了：他的十七歲的小兒子，從去年冬天自動往陜公讀書以後，時常有很長的信寄給父親，將何以要發動自衛戰爭的意義，用極通俗的文字寫了出來，請求他隨時供獻所有的力量。他把最近收到的一封信公開傳觀，意味深長地微笑着，嘻開了脫了門牙的嘴巴。　　「起來……」　　歌聲突然從西面的林子裏射來，打斷了我們愉快的談話，出現在林子盡處的行列，順着曲折的小路，越過河浜，迅速地向前行進，那麽整齊嚴肅的步伐，慷慨宏壯的歌聲，不由你不深深地感動起來。小沈跑去偵査的結果，才知是城裏下鄉的靑年戰地慰勞隊；他們帶着從各地寄來的『慰勞信』，上前錢去慰問着浴血抗戰的鬥士。據老農說，他從來沒有看到像這次的熱烈塲面，卽使平時　荒僻的鄉村，也會發現一隊隊外來靑年的踪跡，歌詠隊，服務隊，慰勞隊等等，什麽都由這裏經過。他不相信魔鬼能够吞噬整個的信陽，「除非把老百姓都殺光了，誰敢踏進鄉村來！」他憤怒地說。　　太陽慢慢地爬下了林子，砲聲還在繼續着，我們誠懇地跟他道別，只才離開了長台，向縣城進發，而飛機轟炸車站的震動聲，又在不停地發瘋了。　　跑上車站，人已擠滿了，都在談論着轟炸的經過，鐵軌上躺着一輛篷車，顯然是被炸毀的；但附近的一切建築物，却還驕傲地存在着，表示了不屈不撓的精神。　　「媽的，連今天森炸了七决了！」有人在氣忿忿地說。關於「文憑」的話  重耳　　目前失學的兒童確是很多的。淪陷區的學校全部摧殘殆盡——在上海雖有許多難民收容所，開辦難童學校，和不少義務小學，安揷這班失學兒童，可是未經補救的還不少。　　至於靑年，允其是淪陷區域上海讀書的靑年，可以說十分之七八都因戰事而失學，並且有的在中學快要畢業，有的甚至快要大學畢業了。家鄕陷落時，人亡家破，顚沛流離，除了極少數富家子弟，還能到上海租界上來繼續讀書，差不多都已失學，失學後因環境不允許久守在家——當然這樣的家庭，有的是浦東南市一帶搬來的，有的是從內地搬來的，當初的時候因爲還有幾個現錢，日長月久餘錢也用得差不多了——只好到處去求出路謀口飯吃。然而一般地方是不允許你的。爲什麼呢？因爲你沒有假面具式的文憑，是不受人家重視的。雖然有文憑的畢業生，不是個個是假面具或繡花枕頭，然而在某種塲合文憑的紙面上的表示眞不能和它所有者的內在一樣。　　有錢的人可以購買文憑，或採取種種手段得到文憑，不論這兩種學生平常的讀書用功與吾，或是程度及格不及格，都可以有機會得到文憑。文憑在一般塲合是更形式化了。　　謀職業要文憑，投考中學或者大學也要文憑，但那些貧窮的沒有文憑的靑年，一方面尋着一個不三不四的職業，一方面却抽閒自修，所謂「行有餘力則以學文」，經過了相當的努力，他再事實上已經修畢某重學程，假定這人是初中二的程度，但現在可以有高中一的程度了，後來因爲他家庭環境轉變，或因其他的關係他能再讀書了，試問那時再呌他去讀初中三不是妄廢了他十幾個月的靑年的寳貴的光陰嗎？反之，如果他能早一年高中畢業，他家庭非但可以少受損失，並且可以得到相當帮助。　　再從謀職業來說吧，如果我是大學畢業生，我現在要謀職業，當然可以向人家宣佈，我在某某大學什麽系畢業，可以有文憑做證據，沒有什麽問題了。但如果我是在四年前的大學三年級輟學的，我耍想謀某一種和我相稱的或者可以使我餬口的職業，須要文憑才行，那時對我所相稱的職業豈不是只好望洋興嘆了嗎？　　你怕程度不齊，儘可舉行考試或試用，爲什麼一味苦求文憑呢？我在道那一方面代表全體失學失業者——商界例外——敬謝各位不求文憑的執事者，一方面也請各位須要看見文憑而給事的先生們改良一下，不要吹毛求疵，埋沒那些可用之材，使毛遂也有自薦的機會。亂草一束  劉籣　　生活　　在太凑巧或太不巧的塲合下，人們演了無數幕重複的戲劇。（我不知道那該呌做悲劇，喜劇，還是悲喜劇。）「巧」，這一個捉狹鬼永遠玩弄着人——不幸的人或幸福的人，通常我們是這麼說的。　　於是，有了命運道個名詞。仰天長歎或樂得伸不直身子，說：「切都是數。」　　對於傳統和橫暴的反抗遂成爲大逆，安份與忍受却成爲美德了。默默地活着，從一代到一代；悄悄地死去，從永遠到永遠。據說這也就是所謂人生。　　但是，我記起了整天流浪在鬧市，在冷街上的失了鄕土的人。我記起了戰爭，砲火，時代的動亂。　　現實是一把烈火，焚毀了命運的邪說。我有點厭惡自己開頭用得太詩意的字眼。生活不是戲劇。我們得戰鬥，並且征服牠；去知道牠，而且去愛護牠。　　吿訴我，什麽是生活？紅鬼子瓦西卡  高爾基著　狄周譯　　「我家里的貨色都是上等的。」她滿足的笑着，誇耀的說，「娘兒們都很年輕，水汪在的啊——最大的也纔二十六歲。這女子我已和各位說過了，她雖說不上是個那樣有趣的女人，却有好肉體！呵！阿爹，你看，——那不是個女人，簡直是個妖精啊來！玖修西卡，到這邊來！……」　　玖修西卡鴨子一般的搖着身子走來。嫖客們只消多少注意地望她一下，就一定會滿意她的肉體。　　她是個中等身段，肥胖，正像用鎚子鍜鍊出來一樣强健的女子。闊胸膛，圓臉孔，小嘴巴，嘟着兩爿紅凍凍的厚嘴唇。　　她那無感覺的無表情的眼睛，呌人想起嵌在洋囡囡臉上的兩顆玻璃珠子。可是低低的獅子鼻，和那使她更像洋囡囡的，直披到眉梢上的捲髮，就是再溫和的客人看了，也要失去和她攀談的興趣。常常對她簡單地這麽說：　　『好的，去吧！』　　於是她用很重的，振動全身的步伐，痴痴的笑着，用眼左右瞟了一瞟走着去了。這一眼是老鴇母敎她的，這呌做「勾魂眼」。　　她的眼是瞟慣了的，每晚上一經打扮舒齊，走進還空着的客廳便開始瞟起「媚眼」來。在客廳里，她總是不停的瞟來瞟去，無論跟姊妹淘在一起，或是跟客人在一起，全都一樣。　　她還有個奇妙的脾氣：拿新菩提樹皮色的長捲髮，盤在頸子上，髮梢掛在胸前，用左手托着——看來好像一綑繩子盤在頸子上似的。　　她說，她的名字呌做阿克西尼瓦卡爾基娜，利藏省人，流蕩出身，會經和一個呌做發傑卡的男子發生過關係，跟一個稅務司職員的家屬一起來到這城里來，生了孩子，她那時還雇過許多奶媽，可是孩子一死，她就給趕出來了，受雇在這裏。在這裏已經住了四年。　　『還稱心嗎？……』客人問她。　　『哪里，喝喝，喫喫，穿穿……只不過糊里糊塗過去罷了……還有那個瓦西卡……老是和我們吵鬧。這惡鬼，……』　　『那末有趣總有趣的吧？』　　『那里？』她使了個媚眼問。　　『這兒……不有趣嗎？』　　「什麽！……」她回答着。就回過頭去望了望客堂，好像在那兒找找可有什麽有趣的東西。（四）</p>

<p>春秋中外假廢鈔票展覽  （學文）　　今日起公開展覽一星期　所陳列僞廢票値五萬元　　你用過假鈔票沒有？假如你急於要貿樣用品，當你拿出鈔票來，人家用手一摸，對亮處一照，說：「這是張假票，請你換一張。」有時候，人家或者要疑心你是個使用「假票」的「專家」，在那塲合裏，也許你到要面紅耳赤。　　所以，辨認鈔票眞假這一點的常識，到是每一個人必須有的，而許多人因爲不認識鈔票，以致吃了很多虧，這似乎是一件很「不愉快」的事情　　現在，我想介紹讀者到一個假廢鈔票展覽會塲去，趁這個機會，你不妨作一個幾十分鐘的訓練，請你用自己的判斷力，去看看假票的眞面目。他們由今日起展覽一星期。　　主持這個假廢票展覽會的是北京路河南路東淸遠里五十號上海錢兌業同人聯誼會，這個會成立到現在，才三個多月，會員也有四五百人。　　他們和銀錢業聯誼會成立一種友誼上的關係，本來很可合併，但因種種習慣上的關係，他們才在錢兌業公會之下，有這聯誼會的組織。　　據他們會中負責人注立之先生說：他們這個展覽會中所陳列的各種僞廢鈔票，約値價四五萬元，只是已經收集僞廢鈔票的一部份，全部的僞廢鈔，値價的有二十二萬三千餘元，如使眞是現在通用的話，到也是一個小小的富翁呢　　展覽期內，並不收門票。等這個會結束以後，他們想在秋凉八月中間，假大新公司舉行一次比較大規模的展覽會，所有收入，將捐作難民經費。　　怎樣辨認僞鈔　　展覽的僞廢鈔可以分作四類：（一）假票類（二）廢票類（三）名貴票類（四）國外鈔票類。　　假鈔票的種類很多，差不多市上通用的各銀行發行的鈔票，僞鈔都有，比如中·中·交·四明·農民·中南·中實等各銀行，都有假印的鈔票。　　我曾問會塲另一負責人方君，假鈔票辨認的方法，他說實際上是不難，大概可以分作幾種：（一）印花模糊（二）色澤不同（三）紙張粗糙稀薄（四）某一特殊部份花樣印不好。假如你細細的辨認一下，眞假可以立辨的。　　至於「改票」及「對分票」，那須特別當心。　　在會塲中，就陳列着這兩種鈔票：（一）把眞鈔票撕成兩張，一面正，一面反，然後用假印的單面僞鈔黏上去，便成兩張鈔票。這兩張鈔票，一面是眞的，一面却是假的，稍一疏忽，你準「吃進去」；（二）所謂改票，也有兩種：第一種是把數目字改一改，比如本來是一元，設法把一元抹去，改成五元或十元，第二種是把不通用銀行的名字換一換，稍不留心，也就溜進你的口袋裏了。　　軍閥發行廢鈔　　在軍閥時代，如張宗昌，曹錕，吳佩孚等，爲了搜括民間現銀，他們都目已印發鈔票，及軍用票。這些鈔票到革命以後都統統成了廢票。這些廢票券雖然廢止，但大批銀元，都被這班軍閥搜括而去。　　在廢票中間，種類很多，除了以上這三個人以外，其他還有張作霖民國元年在關外發行的鈔票：陳炯明在廣東發行的廣東省銀行兌換券；　　　在民國九年發行的中華匯業銀行（中日合辦）鈔票。　　中國最早鈔票　　在名貴鈔票中間，有中國第一次發行的正式鈔票，那是光緒二十四年十一月發行的。發行的銀行為中國通商銀行，那時候呌中國錢票。　　第二種是宣統元年發行的，名字呌大淸銀行兌換券，票面是一兩，但只限東三省通用。　　還有一種更寳貴的是乾隆時代發行的一千文鈔票，上面畫有二龍搶珠，確楚稀見之物，可惜這次沒有陳列。　　盧布馬克公債　　在國外鈔票中間，有舊俄沙皇時代的盧布；香港滙豐銀行一百元假鈔；花旗銀行二十元僞鈔（如眞的可値一百六十元）；德國革命以前的馬克；俄國共產開始（一九一七年）時代發行的一千盧布；及蘇聯現在政府發行的公債。　　拿現在陳列的各種僞廢鈔數量及種數看，似乎還有很多種類偽廢鈔及名貴鈔沒有收集起來，但僅以現在陳列的部份來看，的確也够你留連半小時了，對於偽廢鈔有興趣的讀者，不妨抽出一點功夫，去作一次巡禮。更正　　『雨過天靑』（一五五）第七行，「我們是獨覇了，」「獨覇」誤「燭覇」。第二十行，「今年農科畢業了六十餘人，」「六十」誤「六千」。合行更正。　編輯室雨過天青  包天笑　　第十三回　勸學務農儲材為國　留强汰弱選種有塲　　葛塲長道：「爲了要添招學生，每年又要多製蠶種，這房屋又不够了。所以和朱村長相商的，就是我們這裹西首，到一條山溪爲止的，的有五畝多地，要向村裹租了。」朱村長道：「這爲了蠶業發展的事，一定通得過。我們自由村裏製種塲的種子，以及製種塲的人材，發展到別處去，也是我們自由村與有榮施的事。」葛塲長道：「這是一件。還有一件事，上兩個星期，我在省裏的時候，農業局裏開了個蠶桑會議。也因爲內地省份的養蠶地方漸次多了，他們都到我們這裏購買桑秧，我們有些供不敷求。後來議決下來，說是每一個蠶種製造塲，附屬一個專門栽培桑樹的苗塲，好在每一個製種塲的塲長，都是蠶業出身的，沒有一個不知栽桑之法的。不過苗圃的地方，要請各塲長自己去尋求，總之與製種塲距離不要太遠，可以就近照料。並且隨時可以率領學生，去敎他們如何種植之法，下種，施肥，土壤，蟲害，一切都可以實地學習。所以我們也要有道們一片廣大的塲圃，以便種植桑苗。」朱村長沉吟道：「這個倒要商量起來。」原來自由村也有養蠶人家，也有不少桑田，但是要這樣廣大的苗圃，不在他們土地發展預算之內。葛塲長道：「這苗圃的土地，我已覔得一處，不在本村，却在水竹村裏。有一片廣大的地，可作苗圃之用，我那時已經去看過，而且和徐村長太太也商量過。他們當然也要由村議會決定，但大的是沒有問題的。我們到水竹村去，雖然要波過一條河，但也沒有什麽不便。我們就是不走謝烈士橋，用一隻渡船，渡到對岸去，也便常得很。因爲這塊地方，在對面離運河也不遠，走謝烈士橋反而比較遠一點。我們有的是船，蠶忙時候，運載桑葉的船也不少呀！將來爲便利起見，也許從上岸起，一直到苗圃止，我們特闢一條路，也未可知。再不然，在上下兩岸，各設一個渡頭，以便往來，也無不可。這件事，也應得請命於朱村長的，因此我本來要來訪問你的，就是爲此。恰巧你老先生光降了，那是再好也沒有。」正是：　　近世釵裙多雅達　先生杖履足追陪（一五六）六十年前的上海物價  眉　　偶然翻閱舊報，發　距今六十年前上海租界的物價，其値之廉，若　目前物價相比，不啻霄壤。　　據西曆一八七八年（卽遜淸同治十八年）上海天聲報第一百七十四期所載當時的物價，其値如後：（惟因係制錢，折合法幣計算。）　　白米每石一元三角　鹽每擔一元　　鷄每斤八分　鴨每斤七分　　牛肉每斤六分　麵粉每斤三分　　鷄蛋每百四角半　猪肉每斤九分　　砂糖每斤二分　醬油每斤二分半　　荳油每斤二分　笋乾每斤三分　　黑棗每斤二分　火腿每隻三角半　　上列物價，若與目下相較，固不可以道里計，然設再待六十年後，其物價又不知將增高幾許？本市國術團體　舉行第三次茶話會  亞路　　討論國術普遍化採「小先生制」　餘興有「樂鋸」益友社男女合唱　　本市國術團體素來缺少聯絡，散漫的狀態，實足以使國術每况愈下，因此若干國術界先進團體看到這種缺點，遂發起了一個「上海市國術界茶話會」，藉以喚起國術界的團結，進而互相改進國術上的種種問題。每次茶話會是由每個國術團體輪流召開的，參加者每人納茶點費兩角。第一及第二兩次已經先後由精武體育會銀錢業聯誼社召集舉行過了。昨天是第三次茶話會，由益友社假慈淑大樓大學聯合食堂舉行，參加團體十五，人數一百三十名左右。　　過去的二次茶話會我都會參加，不過我覺得昨天的第三次茶話會，團結的精神更有顯著的進步，而且不論演講，討論的問題以及餘興等等，都很有意義，　刄記憶所及，寫在下面，以作爲紀念和參考。　　九時開會，先由前任上海市國術館要職現執律務的唐豪君演講「催眠與武術」問題。唐先生對於此道素有心得，不過他的硏究對象是根據科學和心理學的，所以他的結論說：催眠術並非玄學的而是科學的，不是神學的而益與心理學，和武學有密切關係和作用的。唐先生對於這一方面還引證許多事實和理論，可惜限於篇幅，不能把它詳記出來。　　唐先生講畢後，因爲參加表演餘興的人，有事須早走一步，要求提前表演，因此接着就是餘興的節目了。　　首先是一位陸先生表演一種新鮮的玩意兒名稱呌做「樂鋸」，就是把胡琴上的灣弓拉在鋼片的鋸子，（即木匠用的）上的輪齒間，發出各種歌曲的音調，雖然聲浪稍低，但是幽雅和諧的奏節，也頗够人回味的。於掌聲劈拍聲中，繼之而來的節目，就是益友社歌詠班男女合唱。　　歌詠節目之後，就開始討論，「怎樣使國術普遍化」問題，把各人的意見歸納起來，必須先要加以解決的間題有下面五點：（一）經費問題；（二）塲地間題；（三）敎材問題；（四）集中問題；（五）思想問題。因爲時間侷促，而且大家對這題目，事先沒有充分預備，要一時獲得圓滿的結論，是不可能的。因此益友社徐文煥先生爲要使「國術普遍化」問題討論出一個初步的推進方法遂提議採取「小先生制」的辦法。他說：因爲目前上海環境的困難，要使國術普遍，對於上面五項問題，實在不易解決。而且上海精於國術的人，至多不過五百人，以人口作此率，每人要敎授一萬人而後使國術普遍是不可能的。所以探用「小先生制」的目的，就是希望已經學習過二三個月的國術同志，把自己所習得的國術，轉授給他人，或用勸誘的方法，去使親友們學習國術，如此一傳十，十傳百，廣泛批進起來，國術不難逐漸普遍。　　最後大家通過了徐先生的提議，各團體自動推定一位負責人主持這件事，並用書面計劃，在下次茶話會中繼續討論。　　一個有意義的茶話會，不論從推進社會進化講，從裨益個人身心講，都是値得提倡的，而况國術能够鍜練人們成爲健全的體格和人格，從而提高我們的生產效能呢。海上煉獄  企華　　“Pacific　Liner”　　雷電華公司出品　大上海戲院映　　「海上煉獄」的故事不能算壞。一個駐船醫師在困難的環境中，醫治艙下火伕的虎烈拉，及機器長扶病工作，使海船早日抵岸，而避免艙底下的疫病傳染給旅客。這裏說明了從事任何職業者都應該有責任心，及共同合作才有良好的收穫。　　但是這劇木沒有經過愼密的分幕工作，又因爲全片的背景，是在一艘海船上，以致祇見人物的出塲進塲，而看不到「戲」了。　　而最大的缺點還在導演手法的拙劣。機器長的「深得伕役敬畏」旣沒有在前面寫得情楚，在火伕們要衝上船面去的時候，機器長的喝令他們工作，就顯得沒有力量。更且在火伕們一個個患病死去，大家決意銜上船面去，那種反抗力的高漲，導演者祗用火爐中的火鏟慢慢收回來，及各個火伕的面部特寫，也是不够狀出當時不可遏止的情緖的。　　維克多麥克勞倫的機器長在艙底下努力加煤那塲戲是演得很感動，吉土馬立斯的醫生，和溫黛葩麗的看護簡直都沒有好好給他們演戲的機會。</p>

<h3>Editorial: Contending for Schools</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's editorial yesterday, regarding several recent events in Shanghai's educational circles, analyzed their disputes with endless sighs and an unwillingness to remain silent. We also considered that the positions held by various parties might have both strengths and weaknesses, and that those who doubt this might not find everything wrong, nor those who oppose it find everything right. Considering the principle of loyalty and forgiveness, even being in the right is enough to justify the sentiment, so we did not want to discuss the matter on its own terms, separately examining its essence, judging its rights and wrongs. We only hope that the parties involved will change their ways and do their best. Now, let us put aside recent events in Shanghai and discuss the general issue of contending for schools.</p>
<p>Schools are originally gardens of education, where you reap what you sow. Examining those who contend, it is not a contention for education, not a contention for sowing melons or beans, but merely a contention for the garden and the land. Contending for the garden and the land is for power and for profit. Those who contend for power and profit in the garden have always been unfilial sons, ignorant villagers, and local bullies and gentry who disregard right and wrong. They all lack the talent and ability to create, and their desire is only to occupy. Those who contend for schools are their ilk. If they claim it is for education, then they contend for schools; if it is for the difference in beliefs regarding the sowing of melons or beans, then they contend for schools for the sake of their beliefs; contending for schools, seemingly defending the way, is deceitful and hypocritical. Taking a step back and assuming that the motivation for contending for schools is as they say, then the effectiveness of contending for schools is vague and unknowable, while the first lesson they teach society and students is the fact and action of contending for possession. Alas, can this be considered instruction?</p>
<p>Yesterday, we said that Chinese society's customs and the actions of academic institutions are always under scrutiny. Now, we say that facts and actions will be used to instruct society and students. Is this an overstatement? Chinese culture has over four thousand years of substantial essence. However, what forms the foundation of this essence, and what is attached to this foundation, is respect for Confucian scholars and valuing the way of the teacher. The West reveres learned experts, much like China's respect for Confucian scholars. But when it comes to the way of the teacher, China uniquely emphasizes it. This is not limited to within the school. Serving the teacher is like serving one's sovereign and father, which is already established. The school is also respected by society, from which education arises and upon which customs depend, so the general society is most respectful to teachers. Descending to modern times, the way of the teacher has gradually declined. However, traditional customs are deeply ingrained in people, so not only is the friendship between teachers and students still not superficial, but society in general can also give deep sympathy and love to schools. Because of this custom, we deeply feel that the position and responsibility of schools in China's education, and those dedicated to education in China, are of greater "weight" than in other countries and than other matters. People in the Chinese education sector, the upper echelons pride themselves on being pure and noble; those who decide are also proud of their purity and nobility, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>Those who respect and love themselves are countless. Those who do not know what education is, do not know what a school is, and do not know what it means to be a teacher are also numerous. Thus, those who are in the education sector are like guests at an inn. Those who run schools are like running factories and stores. Those who stand on the platform to teach are like clowns trying to make the audience laugh. Some seek warmth and sustenance and nest in schools. Some seek profit and invest in opening schools. Genuine goods at fair prices are valued by industry and commerce. Counterfeit and imitation products are condemned by all trades. But the dregs of the education sector have no scruples and exceed even these. They cut corners and produce shoddy goods. They do not mind misleading students in the front, and do not worry about "returning the goods overseas" in the back. They issue a diploma on schedule, waving them out the door, naturally, "no one recognizes the goods after leaving the store." Making money has its ways, and they are shameless and unscrupulous. Those who have school property to plunder and residual profits to embezzle fight with each other, using laws and force to contend for it. They are determined to get it, considering it natural. They make a great clamor and boast of their success. Their absurdity and ugliness are extreme. There is no need to discuss these people, and there is no need to ask about the reputation of their schools. There is even less need to talk about education being sacred and the way of the teacher being respected. However, based on the truth that you reap what you sow, the students they produce are influenced by what they hear and see, and learn from their teachers. What is their belief, what is their faith, how will they conduct themselves in the world, how will they act in society and the nation? This is a hidden worry for the nation and the race, but it is still a matter for the future. Currently, because Chinese society's customs are always under scrutiny by academic institutions, the shallow-minded masses will get the impression that they are the newly literate class, that they are engaged in a pure and noble career, that they are dignified and up-to-date, and that they see the adults and gentlemen in charge of these affairs. "Those who achieve will be like this!" Isn't this giving society a powerful practical education by contending for schools?</p>
<h3>Measures for Cleaning Up Privately Stored Opium</h3>
<p>Set up a superintendent to clean up privately stored opium. The task is to be completed within five months; violators will be punished.</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The six-year opium prohibition plan is implemented in phases and regions. The opium produced in counties where cultivation is gradually prohibited should have been统收 (unified collection) in the 26th year. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it was not implemented as scheduled. The original deadline for complete prohibition in the 29th year is now only 18 months away. According to the original plan, Sichuan and counties where prohibition is gradually enforced were explicitly ordered to prohibit cultivation in the autumn of the 27th year. Recently, General Chiang also issued a secret handwritten order from Yuzhong, absolutely prohibiting any further secret cultivation this autumn and winter, with violators to be severely punished with the death penalty. Therefore, privately stored opium among the people should be cleaned up within a limited time to rectify the source. Premier Kong specially proposed measures for cleaning up privately stored opium in order to thoroughly strengthen the prohibition policy and achieve practical results. A public office for the superintendent to clean up privately stored opium will be established in necessary provinces, after consultation with General Chiang, to be established on a set date and completed within five months through unified collection and strict enforcement to thoroughly clear out all opium without omission, with violators to be punished with the death penalty, to demonstrate the government's determination to complete the six-year plan. The proposal was passed at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 4th. The original proposal and measures are as follows:</p>
<p>"Original Proposal for Cleaning Up Opium"</p>
<p>The six-year opium prohibition plan is promoted in stages, with regulations for unified collection and purchase of opium stored among the people, to eradicate the root cause and implement control. The deadline for complete prohibition in the 29th year is only ten months away. If privately stored opium is not unifiedly collected, concentrated, and strictly controlled according to the original plan, it will be difficult to completely eliminate it. Furthermore, the President, considering the approaching prohibition deadline, specially issued a handwritten order absolutely prohibiting any further secret cultivation this autumn and winter, with violators to be severely punished with the death penalty. Therefore, in the future, the work of cleaning up opium stored among the people must be intensified to achieve daily success. However, unified collection is related to local military and political affairs in every aspect. To prevent unscrupulous military police units and local bullies from selling and releasing opium privately, it is necessary to hold military and political organs responsible for strict investigation and prohibition to be effective. Except for Yunnan Province, where opium production has long been controlled and managed by the provincial government, and the situation in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, which is being investigated and considered, Sichuan, Kangding, and Guizhou provinces, which have always produced opium, still have a large amount of opium stored among the people. To thoroughly implement the prohibition policy and intensify the cleaning-up work, it seems that a public office for the superintendent to clean up privately stored opium should be specially established in each of these provinces, to supervise and urge the administrative inspectors and commissioners of each region and the county magistrates of each county to strictly implement the policy, so as to assign specific responsibility and facilitate promotion. The public office should have two departments, the first and second, and three sections, the secretarial, military law, and discipline inspection. The head of the first department will be concurrently held by the director of the provincial civil affairs department, and the head of the second department will be concurrently held by the director of the provincial opium prohibition supervision branch. They will closely coordinate and cooperate based on their inherent powers, so as to achieve success. Cases of private trafficking will be handled by the military law section, regardless of whether the offenders are officials or civilians. The director will be selected and dispatched by the General Supervision Department of Military Law Enforcement. The investigation and crackdown on unified collection of privately stored opium, and the supervision of personnel at all levels, will be managed by the discipline inspection section. The director will be selected and dispatched by the Military Affairs Commission. A supervisory committee will be established in each county where opium is cleaned up, inviting the secretary-general of the county party headquarters, temporary senators, and local enthusiastic and impartial gentry who are dedicated to opium prohibition to serve as members and perform supervisory duties to prevent abuses. In addition, each county magistrate should strictly order and supervise the district Lianbao chiefs and Jia chiefs to inform the masses of the government's determination to prohibit opium. Those who privately store opium should be given a deadline to hand it over to the government, and paid according to the price verified by the competent authority. On the day of completion, the district Lianbao chiefs and Jia chiefs should issue a certificate ensuring that there are no omissions to show verification and consideration. According to the six-year opium prohibition plan, opium addicts will be taught to quit in stages based on age. Before the deadline, the opium prohibition organs will be responsible for distributing opium based on opium prohibition regulations and opium quitting licenses, with gradual reductions in stages. Those who previously registered for opium quitting licenses should be re-registered by the local government for a comprehensive registration once, and new licenses will be issued after verification, exempting license fees, as a basis for distribution, teaching to quit, and gradual reduction, so as to ensure that the four prohibitions of cultivation, transportation, sale, and smoking are advanced in parallel and implemented thoroughly. If there are any who deliberately conceal opium beyond the cleaning-up deadline, they will be treated as private possession, confiscated, and severely punished. Those who protect, condone, store, or release opium privately, regardless of whether they are civil or military officials at all levels, or local bullies and gentry, will be punished by military law, to serve as a warning. With such strict measures, the people's opium storage can be cleaned up, and the six-year opium prohibition plan can be achieved as scheduled. The general outline of measures for cleaning up privately stored opium and the organizational regulations of the public office for the superintendent to clean up privately stored opium are submitted for approval."</p>

<h3>British Far East Defense Conference to be Held in Simla, India</h3>
<p>Britain and France Agree to Close Naval Cooperation Against Japan</p>
<p>Thailand's Position is Important in Seeking to Enlist</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to today's Hong Kong dispatch from the Japanese English-language Times, the British Defense Conference will be held soon in Simla, India. Attendees will include the Governor-General of India, the Governor-General of Burma, and military experts from various regions, some of whom attended the Anglo-French Joint Defense Conference in Singapore. According to the Japanese Times, the Anglo-French Joint Defense Conference in Singapore decided that if Britain and France were to engage in war with Japan, Britain would abandon Hong Kong, and the Anglo-French joint fleet would use Singapore as its base. The Singapore Conference reportedly also decided on the issue of India sending reinforcements to Singapore, which will be the main topic of the Simla Conference. In addition, the Indian Air Force will also be an important issue. It is reported that although the naval strategies of Britain and France have not yet been completed, the two countries have decided to take a unified attitude. At the same time, since the U.S. Navy may not participate in the Anglo-French alliance, Britain and France are hoping to obtain the cooperation of the Dutch East Indies and Australia. As for Thailand, Britain and France are also trying to enlist its support. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the results of the Anglo-French military conference held in Singapore are kept secret, political figures in Hong Kong have received reports stating that the conference decided to provide Thailand with a guarantee of territorial inviolability. The commander of the British fleet in China, Nobel, will visit the commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, Yarnell, to discuss plans for mutual assistance in the event of war. Hong Kong newspapers also stated that in the event of war in the Far East, Britain may strategically abandon Hong Kong, and the current deployment of reinforcements may only be Britain's intention to show the world its determination to protect its interests in Asia. In reality, if war breaks out in the Far East, Singapore will be the base for the British army. However, since Singapore only has a garrison of 10,000 troops and the amount of oil stored is not large, the British and French naval commanders agreed that in order to protect the source of raw materials and maritime transportation, there is a need to invite the cooperation of the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, and the Philippines. Therefore, Britain and France agreed to provide Thailand with protection, and Britain will send a military delegation to Thailand. (9th Haitong Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Implements Mobilization Law, Forcibly Conscripting Workers Nationwide, Effective from the 15th</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that the Japanese Emperor promulgated an imperial edict on the morning of the 8th, invoking Article 4 of the National Mobilization Law to forcibly conscript labor from July 15 to engage in businesses necessary for national mobilization. According to indirect news from independent sources, the new clause has two purposes: (1) To expand the munitions industry, which currently lacks skilled labor. This skilled labor will now be transferred from so-called "peaceful industries." (2) To sacrifice industries that manufacture domestic consumer goods and strengthen industries that manufacture export goods. According to the new clause, the distribution of labor will be subject to the following restrictions, invoking Article 6 of the National Mobilization Law. The employment of elementary school graduates (juvenile labor) in industries other than munitions will be greatly reduced. (3) Male workers in "peaceful industries" will be replaced by women. Male workers under the age of 30 will be retained according to special laws to engage in the munitions industry. (4) Various restrictions will be imposed on "peaceful industries," and unemployment will inevitably follow. The government will provide vocational guidance to cope with this. Whenever necessary to secure more labor, the limits of current laws will be expanded for the purpose of transferring it from non-military industries to fire industries. According to the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, under the new law, the Army and Navy Ministries have the power to ask the Ministry of Health and Welfare to register all technical experts for work in factories designed by the military. When making this request, the Army and Navy Ministries intend to refrain from interfering "excessively" with these technical experts in the future and will carefully consider not drastically changing their living standards and environment.</p>

<h3>U.S. Neutrality Law Revision Issue, Two Senate Foreign Relations Committees Have a Significant Impact</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to discuss the revision of the Neutrality Law on the 11th of this month. Whether the report on abolishing the arms embargo clause can be passed will depend on the attitude of two members. The committee has a total of 23 members. As of now, 11 members favor abolition and 10 members advocate maintaining it. The remaining two members, Gillette and George, both belong to the Democratic separatist faction. During the Senate re-election last year, the Democratic leaders had a very negative impression of them. Now that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reached the final stage of discussion, it is not impossible that these two members will collude with the opposition faction. The government side is therefore quite anxious. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has a total of 23 members, of which 11 support President Roosevelt's requests regarding the Neutrality Act.

<h3>Bonnet Warns: France is Determined to Cooperate with Britain to Curb Violent Aggression, Poland's Independence is Threatened, and Obligation to Guarantee Will be Fulfilled</h3>
<p>(Paris) Britain and France will send a new warning to Hitler this week, stating that if Germany does not give up its encroachment on Danzig, it should prepare to fight Poland and other countries such as Britain, France, and Romania. The first warning on this matter will be presented by the French Foreign Minister today, and the British side will be presented by Chamberlain in a speech in the Lower House tomorrow. According to the French Foreign Ministry, the situation in Danzig has eased, and Berlin will shift its attention to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the Balkans in order to counter the position of democratic countries in Turkey. (9th Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Toulouse, France) French Foreign Minister Bonnet attended a dinner party of the socialist branch here and delivered a speech, stating, "What we seek is to maintain peace in the world to a certain extent. Today, people in various countries often feel uneasy about border security, believing that violence and war are imminent, which is intolerable. This is why we are determined to resist attempts at control by violence." The connection between France and various countries that love peace and freedom is gradually becoming closer. As far as Britain is concerned, the close cooperation between the two countries is beyond compare. As far as Turkey is concerned, an important agreement has been established with France. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, negotiations are underway with Britain and France, hoping that a tripartite mutual assistance agreement can be concluded quickly. In addition, France has been committed to reconstruction work in recent months, "which has made it easier for Britain to implement conscription. This is a significant sacrifice for the British people. According to the past 250 years, the British people only accepted conscription in the four years of the European War. Now this system has been approved by the British Parliament for implementation two months ago, and its significance is self-evident. In short, the strength of our country's army must be actively expanded without any slackening. The people of the whole country should complete their responsibilities with the same courage and perseverance within their respective scope. How our country's destiny will be is up to us. If the people of the country can unite and be determined, they will surely achieve good results, as can be seen from the achievements made over the past year." (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) French Foreign Minister Bonnet told the London Sunday Times yesterday, "Britain and France must maintain the territorial integrity and independence of their colonial empires, and maintain peace in the world to a certain extent. As far as the relationship between Britain and France is concerned, it has been good for many years, and the friendly relationship has improved even more since last year. Whether in politics, military affairs, or economics, we can cooperate closely based on realistic foundations. The two major nations are truly interdependent. As far as the European situation is concerned, people in various countries often feel uneasy about border security, believing that violence and war are imminent, which is intolerable. The diplomatic authorities of Britain and France are working hard to mediate, all to safeguard the security of various nations and lay the foundation for peace." At this point, the reporter asked about the future of the negotiations on the tripartite mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Bonnet replied, "We must use various methods to complete this matter."</p>
<p>The reporter then asked about France's attitude towards Poland. Foreign Minister Bonnet replied, "As for France's attitude towards Poland, just read the broadcast speech delivered by Prime Minister Daladier on April 14 this year, and the speech I delivered to many members of the French and Polish parliaments on June 9, and you will fully understand. In other words, France and Poland have already guaranteed each other. If the vital interests of both sides are directly or indirectly threatened, they should assist each other. If Poland's independence and various rights are harmed, the heroic spirit of the country's ancestors will be very useful, and Britain and France will also provide assistance without reservation, which the country knows well." At this point, the newspaper added a comment, "The reporter cannot fully disclose all the points discussed with Foreign Minister Bonnet, but there is one thing that can be disclosed without harming the political interests of the countries concerned, which is what Foreign Minister Bonnet said: The current situation in Europe is very serious, but France's unity and strength in recent months are sufficient to cope with all events."

<h3>Turkey is Not Afraid of War, Negotiating with Britain and France to Negotiate a Permanent Alliance</h3>
<p>Turkish Capital Foreign Minister Salaroglu delivered a speech at the National Assembly, stating, "We are willing to maintain peace, whether domestically or with our neighbors. If someone wants to make the price of peace higher than war, we should deal with them and win. Our country's traditional policy of emphasizing neutrality and maintaining peace has been abandoned and joined the armed peace camp. This transformation is due to the crisis caused by the repeated decisions of countries, which led to the destruction of Albania. Albania is poor and has few people, and its appeal to people is far less than that of our country, but it was annexed. How can we not use this as a warning? The newspapers of all-powerful countries often attack our country, and I will answer them here, 'Those who advocate that Britain and Germany should conclude an alliance treaty are now attacking the alliance treaty between Britain and Turkey, which is self-contradictory. In short, our country is conducting negotiations with Britain and France, hoping to establish a permanent tripartite mutual assistance agreement." (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Tries to Make a Final Effort to Promote the Anti-Invasion Front, Negotiations in Moscow Continue, Britain and Poland to Conclude Formal Alliance</h3>

<h3>Germany Builds Western Defense Line, Consuming Manpower and Resources, Announces a General Account</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Defense Engineering Inspector General Jakob published an article in the "Military Weekly" detailing the defense of the German West, stating that Hitler initially ordered the construction of 17,000 defense projects, but the number has increased to 22,000. To rush the construction of defense projects, sometimes as many as 500,000 workers were needed. The German road construction project began on July 20 last year, with 35,000 workers. However, due to the complexity of the work, the number gradually increased, reaching 342,000 by October 6. At the same time, large teams of infantry and engineers regularly inspect the effectiveness of the defense projects under construction. During the above-mentioned period, one-third of the total output of German cement plants was used for defense projects, and a total of 695,000 cubic meters of wood were used. More than 8,000 trains transport building materials every day. The German heavy industry has greatly expanded due to the need to supply a large amount of armor manufacturing. 15,000 large trucks and 5,000 buses are needed every day for transportation and supply. Alas, how prosperous it is! (9th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Plans Three Possible Plans to Invade Poland; Hitler's Reckless Actions will Inevitably Lead to World War</h3>
<p>Lucerne, the Swiss capital, The "Fatherland" newspaper, the organ of the Catholic Conservative Party, recently disclosed a document with the title "Germany's Plan to Attack Poland," which is said to have been obtained from reliable German sources. The content stated that Germany is considering three plans. The first is to make Poland succumb without a fight. If the mutual assistance agreement negotiated by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union fails, Britain and France should abandon Poland. At that time, Poland will have to submit to Germany. The second is a military plan, to launch a local war and force Poland to submit. The method is to use the strategy of the Battle of Tannenberg (during the European War, the German army defeated the Russian army in Tannenberg) to surround the Polish army on three sides in the Brenberg area with lightning speed and occupy the industrial area of Upper Silesia in Poland, in order to quickly create a "fait accompli." In this way, Poland's allies would be caught off guard even if they wanted to send troops to help, and Poland would have to negotiate an "honorable" peace with Germany and cede the Polish Corridor and Upper Silesia to Germany. However, the port of Gdynia would still be retained by Poland, and the country would be allowed to build a road in German territory to connect the port with the Polish mainland. The port of Danzig would be designated as a tax-free port, allowing Poland to enjoy its rights. These "moderate" conditions would allow Britain and France to fall into its trap, preventing them from rising up to oppose it, and inducing Poland to conclude a military alliance treaty with Germany. The third is that if Britain and France send troops to help Poland, Germany should first use all its strength to defeat Poland, and then move its troops westward, while adopting a large-scale "peace offensive" to shorten the war period. The newspaper also added a comment, "This German plan is enough to cause a world war. The country's intention is to diplomatically and spiritually frustrate the British and French peace front, so as to establish hegemony in Central Europe first. However, it is feared that the peace camp organized by the democratic countries may not allow it to succeed." (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to various observations, Hitler has temporarily abandoned the plan to create an internal change in Danzig. On the one hand, Germany's frantic preparations last week have obviously eased. On the other hand, Hitler has felt that if Germany changes the status of Danzig, Britain will decide to support Poland with military force. As for Poland's attitude towards Danzig, it has been clarified by the Polish Foreign Ministry, that is, (1) Danzig must be within the scope of the Polish customs system, (2) Poland's rights and interests should not be subject to theoretical or factual restrictions. The militarization of Danzig will be considered the first step of restriction, so it must be opposed. British Prime Minister Chamberlain will also declare tomorrow Britain's determination to fulfill its obligations. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italy Determined to be Germany's Backer, Supporting the Recovery of Danzig</h3>

The magazine stated, "Since Britain and France have decided to make the Danzig issue an item against the policies of all-powerful countries, it is better to frankly announce that the Italian people will always be Germany's solid backer. Germany has decided to solve the Danzig issue in the German way, just like the Czech incident. When the Danzig issue reaches a critical juncture and forms two camps, let everyone know that Italy has made a decision." (9th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

Although rice stocks in various warehouses have decreased, this is a normal occurrence during the transition between harvests. However, the city's overall reserves are substantial, sufficient to meet three months of demand. Rice boats detained in various locations have been released and are arriving in Shanghai. Foreign rice orders have been placed and transactions completed, with a large quantity expected to arrive mid-month. There is absolutely no concern about food shortages for the population. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Warehouse Stocks Reduced, Actual Reserves Sufficient</p>
<p>According to the Bean and Rice Trade Association's survey last week, the total amount of rice stored in various warehouses in Shanghai was 399,902 bags. This number is indeed nearly half less than the previous reserve of 600,000 bags. However, according to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter's investigation, these stocks are limited to warehouses in the two concessions.  It is rumored that there are considerable reserves north of the Suzhou River and in the western part of Shanghai. At the same time, hundreds of rice shops throughout the city have nearly 500,000 bags in their internal warehouses. Many middle and upper-class citizens have also purchased and stored rice due to rising prices. Therefore, the actual rice reserves in Shanghai have not decreased but are quite sufficient, enough to last for at least three months. There is absolutely no need to worry about the future of the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Rice Boats Released, Sources Increase</p>
<p>When rice boats from various places were heading to Shanghai, they were detained en route due to donation taxes and other issues.  Now, after the cargo owners have cleared the matter by paying taxes, most have been released.  Consequently, the number of boats arriving from downstream has gradually increased in recent days. During the period when rice boats were detained, rice transferred from inland ports and transported by train continued to arrive in Shanghai as usual, averaging four to five thousand bags per day. Wuxi and Wuhu, which are rice distribution centers, often experience border closures. Therefore, some cargo owners detour to transport rice to Shanghai.  Consequently, the amount of Wuxi white japonica rice and Wuhu indica rice on the market has not decreased significantly due to interceptions.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>A Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned from people in the rice industry that the prices of medium and low-grade rice in Shanghai have reached nearly 20 yuan, equivalent to the price of foreign rice. Some rice merchants have already contacted foreign merchants to negotiate orders. Several transactions have been completed, with quantities of 500 tons, 1,000 tons, and 2,000 tons. Most are handled by French trading houses.  Some of it, specifically the 2,000 tons of Saigon rice re-ordered by the grain trading firm that cancelled the initial order in May due to the surge in exchange rates, is scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai before the end of this month.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Stabilize, Expected to Fall Back</p>
<p>The summer season is typically a slow period for the rice market. Currently, sources from various places have not been interrupted, and foreign rice continues to be ordered. Due to the hot weather and the unsuitability for long-term storage, general hoarders and rice shops are rushing to sell their stocks. Rice shops have sufficient stocks and have reduced their appetite for purchasing. Therefore, market sales have sharply decreased. At the same time, the Concession authorities dispatch police officers daily to the market to supervise and strictly enforce price limits.  Therefore, in recent days, rice prices, except for the highest quality white japonica, which remains at the limited price of 21 yuan, have fallen by two to three dimes compared to the limited price for other medium and low-grade rice. Based on the current inventory and sales situation, it is estimated that rice prices are expected to fall back in the future.</p>
<p>After Centralized Check Exchange, Money Shops Suggest Improvements, Based on Pei Yunqing's Proposed Ideas, Six Difficulties, Three Improvements</p>
<p>After the Silver and Money Trade Association decided to implement centralized check exchange starting July 4th, Pei Yunqing, a leader in the money shop industry, agreed with the principle of centralization. However, he believed that there was a need to improve the procedures. He specifically put forward various difficulties and improvement measures to solicit opinions from various shops, suggesting submission to the Trade Association. It is rumored that the Money Trade Association will hold a meeting to discuss this matter. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Points of Difficulty</p>
<p>Pei proposed the following difficulties after centralization: (1) Sudden changes in habits cause great inconvenience in procedures; (2) Centralized check exchange involves a large number of checks, making it impossible to adjust the time; (3) Checks from other industries cannot be settled because the delivery procedures have not been completed, resulting in a shortage of funds for clearing; (4) Regarding overdraft limits for customers, such as customer A originally having a limit of 5,000 yuan, but overdrawing an additional 1,000 yuan today. In normal times, this could be communicated with customer A to determine a solution. Now, due to the delayed check collection time, it is impossible to contact the customer.  If the check is rashly returned, it will harm the relationship and hinder future business; (5) According to Shanghai custom, cross-outs and returned checks must be stamped with a return slip by the issuing party on the same day before they can be entered into the accounts. Now, due to the excessively delayed exchange time, it is impossible to obtain the return slip. Who bears the responsibility; (6) After office hours, senior staff still need to clear accounts due to funding shortages and cannot leave their posts.  Junior and middle-level staff are tied down dealing with customer deficits, while the check settlement process is still underway, keeping the accountants busy. As a result, everyone feels dissatisfied and cannot go home.</p>
<p>Improvement Measures</p>
<p>Proposed improvement measures: (1) Distinguish between checks submitted to the Clearing Bank and those submitted to Entrusted Banks. Some 42 member money shops are financially strong, yet remain classified as Entrusted Banks. This disparity in fact and status seems inappropriate and warrants consideration for inclusion among the Clearing Banks; (2) All checks from various shops received by the bank can be processed immediately. Each shop should examine and open each check and attach a cover with the total number of checks and the total value, and submit it to the Clearinghouse for exchange. The banks will entrust the Clearinghouse to exchange checks from various shops against the Money Exchange. If the preliminary procedures are completed before the exchange, there will be no need to wait to complete them after, saving a great deal of time; (3) Alternatively, the Clearinghouse could provide 42 settlement books to the Money Exchange, which would distribute them to the various shops. Each shop would directly deliver the checks to the Clearinghouse for exchange, obtain the return slip, and then take it to the Money Exchange for accounting. The banks would also follow the same procedure, submitting the Clearinghouse settlement book to the Money Exchange, and then submitting it to the Clearinghouse for accounting, to streamline the process.</p>
<p>New Draft System, Foreign Merchants Agree to Accept, Wide Circulation, No Different From Cash, Sufficient for Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Funds</p>
<p>Since the Silver and Money Trade Association implemented the new draft system, allowing various banks and shops to use interbank drafts with a total value of 50 million National Currency, it has already circulated in the market. In addition to announcing the draft interest rate daily, the Banking Joint Preparatory Committee has established a Custody Committee to manage the assets provided by various banks and shops, and a Valuation Committee to assess the value of the assets provided. A Draft Preparation Inspection Committee was formed to handle matters related to the preparation and inspection of draft usage. Regarding the issue of foreign banks accepting the new draft, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency recently learned from banking circles that after the Banking Joint Preparatory Committee contacted the Foreign Banks Association, they agreed in principle to the new draft system and agreed to send personnel to guarantee the Custody Committee and Inspection Committee of the Association. It is rumored that American Chase Bank and others have agreed to accept it and have opened accounts with the Banking Joint Preparatory Committee. Therefore, in the future, the new drafts will be widely circulated and can be remitted to the mainland to purchase local goods. The circulation effect is no different from cash and is sufficient to meet the funding needs of Shanghai's industry and commerce. Regarding the issuance of draft certificates, although issuance methods have been drafted, it is now decided to submit it to the Standing Committee for approval based on market needs. However, the committee believes that after using interbank drafts, circulation is very convenient, and there seems to be no immediate need to issue them.</p>
<p>Six-Province Joint Transportation Already Implemented</p>
<p>In order to develop foreign trade, facilitate the distribution of inland products, and increase wartime finance, the National Government authorities have already purchased cotton, tea, tung oil, and other goods at market prices for centralized export. To facilitate transportation, they are promoting water, land, and air joint transportation. It is reported that joint transportation in Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces was implemented on July 1st. Although coastal shipping has declined, inland land transportation is becoming increasingly developed.</p>
<p>Steamships Navigating Inland Harbors Dominated by Japanese Vessels, German and Italian Vessels Increase Significantly, British Vessels Greatly Reduced, Portuguese, Norwegian, and American Trading Vessels Disappear</p>
<p>As the Yangtze River has not been opened, various foreign shipping companies have developed downstream inland harbors. At the peak, there were more than 80 steamships operating, with British ships accounting for the largest number. Since the Japanese implemented control over inland harbor shipping, British trading ships have encountered squeeze-outs. However, German trading ships have taken the opportunity to rise. According to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter's investigation, currently, steamships operating in inland harbors are mostly Japanese trading ships. Portuguese, Norwegian, and American trading ships have disappeared. There are only five or six British trading ships. German vessels include Jiang Ding, Hai Yi, Hai Kang, Lu An, Heng Xi, Hai De, Kai Si Teng, Xin Jiang Nan, Roma Lu, and more than ten others. Italian vessels include Chang De, Yi Ya Na, De Yao, and six or seven others.</p>
<p>Japanese Izumo Battleship Returns to the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Japanese flagship Izumo abruptly left the Huangpu River a few days ago. It was said to have gone to Fujian to direct operations. It is now reported that the ship sailed into the Huangpu River yesterday morning at 11:00 am and is still berthed at the Mitsubishi Wharf. Hundreds of naval personnel of unknown origin have arrived.</p>
<p>National Goods Charity Sale Continues for Four Days</p>
<p>The Silver and Money Trade Amateur Association held a charity sale of national goods from July 1st to 2nd for two days, with excellent results. The association will continue to hold the charity sale at its premises from July 11th to 14th. More than 20 national goods manufacturers are participating, including China Chemical Industry Co., Wuzhou Pharmacy, and Taikang Food Company.</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance Vigorously Adjusts, Trade Between Various Countries and China Improves, Import and Export Goods Increase Compared to Pre-War Levels, However, Deficit in Occupied Ports Increases Sharply</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance vigorously adjusted international trade, banned the import of non-essential goods, and promoted the export of major local products, overall trade has returned to pre-war levels. However, the deficit figure has increased more than before. The Ministry has now taken steps to reverse the trend of international payments, so that future trade can get on the right track and balance national payments. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Overall Trade Has Returned to Former State</p>
<p>Regarding import and export trade from January to May of the 26th, 27th, and 28th years of the Republic: (1) In the 26th year, imports were 491,339,229 yuan, exports were 398,029,342 yuan, totaling 889,368,571 yuan. (2) In the 27th year, imports were 370,685,395 yuan, exports were 248,220,033 yuan, totaling 618,905,428 yuan. (3) In the 28th year, imports were 568,089,774 yuan, exports were 343,034,556 yuan, totaling 911,124,330 yuan.</p>
<p>Deficit Figures Increase Comparatively</p>
<p>Regarding the deficit, after the government made every effort to eliminate it, the non-occupied areas, such as Mengzi, Wenzhou, Tengyue, Simao, and other ports, have all become surplus areas. However, the occupied areas, such as Shanghai and Tianjin, have seen increased deficit due to the government's lack of power. For example, the deficit from January to May of the year before last was 93,309,887 yuan, the deficit for the same period last year was 122,465,362 yuan, and the deficit for the same period this year was 225,055,218 yuan. The deficits in Shanghai and Tianjin ports have set new records. From January to May this year, the Shanghai port was 111,374,000 yuan, and the Tianjin port was 108,259,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Imports and Exports of Foreign Goods Increase</p>
<p>Trade between various countries and China declined sharply under the influence of the war when the war first started. It has now improved, and both imports and exports have increased. Taking January to May of the past two years as an example: (1) The United States was 100,351 yuan last year and 114,254 yuan this year; (2) The United Kingdom was 53,000 yuan last year and 56,787 yuan this year; (3) Germany was 78,991 yuan last year and 66,199 yuan this year; (4) Japan was 81,574 yuan last year and 163,621 yuan this year (units are in thousands of yuan).</p>
<p>Promulgate Measures to Balance Income and Expenditure</p>
<p>In view of maintaining the balance of international payments, the Ministry of Finance considers it an essential element of any country's economic policy. If trade trends are unfavorable, efforts should be made to maintain the balance to avoid affecting the foreign exchange market. On July 3rd, it promulgated measures to prohibit the import of goods during the emergency period, as well as regulations for applying for foreign exchange for imported goods and methods for settling foreign exchange for exported goods. The export of local products can be gradually increased. The import of non-essential foreign goods is prohibited from entering the occupied areas. They cannot be re-exported to the non-occupied areas and cannot enjoy legal prices, which can balance international payments and reduce the overall deficit.</p>
<p>Polish Women's Association Holds Charity Fair, Revenue Over 1,700 Yuan</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily News reported on the 9th that, according to a letter from the Polish Women's Association, the charity fair held by the association on June 16th to raise funds for disaster relief was very successful. The total income, excluding expenses, was 1,721 yuan, 4 dimes, and 1 cent.</p>
<p>Revival Bonds to be Redeemed by Lottery This Morning</p>
<p>Long-Term Fixed-Term Redemption and Interest Payment for Finance, Measures to Maintain Creditworthiness Have Been Decided</p>
<p>Although the Ministry of Finance announced on January 15th that it would no longer advance funds for the payment of domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties, in order to maintain creditworthiness, matured Unification and Revival Gold Bonds and Long Term Bonds will continue to be redeemed and paid interest as usual. However, the payment will be made in full in Chongqing. The principal and interest payable on the five types of Unification Bonds A, B, C, D, and E that will mature at the end of July this year amount to 56,453,500 yuan. Although payment methods have not yet arrived in Shanghai, it is said that the Ministry of Finance has indeed decided on payment methods. Therefore, the prices of various Unification Bonds in Shanghai's gray market have rebounded sharply. Regarding the lottery for the 7th redemption of Revival Bonds, the National Debt Fund Management Committee has scheduled it to be held at 10:00 am today, with five winning numbers to be drawn for a redemption of 1,700,000 yuan and an interest payment of 9,894,000 yuan, payable on August 31st. The lottery for the 12th redemption of Long-Term Financial Bonds is scheduled to be held on September 10th, with 25 winning numbers to be drawn for a redemption of 1,125,000 yuan and an interest payment of 400,781 yuan and 5 dimes, payable on September 30th.</p>
<p>Japanese Threatens Over Abuse of the French Flag, Says If "Abuse" Occurs Again, It Will Consider its Attitude Towards the French Flag</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that a Japanese Navy spokesperson claimed at a press conference yesterday (the 8th) that Japanese officials have already drawn the attention of the French authorities to the Chinese military's abuse of the French flag. If such "abuse" occurs again, it may cause Japan to "reconsider its attitude toward the French flag." When asked what "reconsideration of attitude" meant, the spokesperson replied that the Japanese might not recognize the French flag as a neutral flag. Before making this statement, the spokesperson claimed that the Japanese Navy authorities had instructed the Japanese Consul General to ask the French Consul to pay attention to the incident that occurred on June 30th in Datianzhuang (transliteration), Zhoushan Island. When the Japanese army approached the town, the French flag hanging on a building that appeared to be a church was taken down and replaced with the Japanese flag. If such incidents occur again, Japan may reconsider its attitude toward the French flag.</p>

<p>Father Leys, Naturalized Chinese, Delivers Speech on the Just War, Broadcasts to Japanese Catholic Friends in Chongqing, Response to the So-Called "New Order"</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that Father Leys, a Belgian naturalized in China, who directs hygiene and rescue brigades behind the Japanese front lines in Shanxi Province, recently broadcast a response in Chongqing to a call by Japanese Catholic civilians for Chinese cooperation in establishing a "new order" in the Far East. He said, "There is no peace without justice. This is a question of justice. Who is the righteous one? Who is the aggressor in this world? I can answer: We are the invaded. We defend ourselves by resisting the aggressors who are determined to deprive us of our livelihood. Therefore, our war is a model of a just war, a war of self-preservation waged to seek the necessary and inalienable right to survive."</p>
<p>Shanghai YMCA to Hold Health Education Week, from Today to the 16th, Overall Goal is to Eliminate the New Five Poisons</p>
<p>In recent years, the population of Shanghai has increased sharply. With the arrival of summer, diseases and deaths occur one after another. The overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in alleyways are important factors contributing to illness. If preparations and precautions are not taken early, the consequences could be serious. In view of this, the Shanghai YMCA has scheduled a Health Week for seven days from July 10th to 16th. Its main purpose is to widely publicize the methods of prevention to residents of the city, so as to reduce disease and increase social welfare. Five diseases, dysentery, malaria, cholera, typhoid, and diphtheria, are compared to the new five poisons. It is reported that the association has now arranged and displayed various health materials at the Eight Immortals Bridge Clubhouse to alert readers and promote early prevention to protect their health.

<p>Tension in Northern Suburbs of Dinghai, Eastern Zhejiang Suffers Repeated Bombings, Airfields Thoroughly Destroyed</p>
<p>Since the fall of Dinghai, order has not yet been restored, and very few merchants have returned. County Magistrate Su has crossed the sea to Ningbo and then to the province to request assistance from the authorities. As the Japanese are also coveting Xiushan, which is only four li north of Dinghai, the situation is quite tense. Various circles in Dinghai have been fleeing to Shanghai and Ningbo in droves, taking the elderly and children with them. Due to the sudden change of events, those who fled alone did not bring any clothes with them. The lives of the refugees arriving in Ningbo are worrying. In order to avoid displacement, the Ningbo authorities have set up shelters and appointed personnel to handle the accommodation matters. All Dinghai residents seeking refuge in Ningbo must register before they can reside in designated locations.</p>
<p>Bombing Summary</p>
<p>Traffic circles have learned of the recent bombings by Japanese aircraft in various coastal counties of eastern Zhejiang as follows: (1) On the 29th of last month, 12 Japanese aircraft attacked Zhenhai in two batches and dropped 99 bombs. The fortress fortifications were solid, and there was no loss; (2) On the 5th of this month, 3 Japanese aircraft attacked Zhenhai again and dropped 8 bombs. Houses caught fire, destroying more than 40 houses and causing more than ten casualties; (3) On the 5th, 3 Japanese aircraft attacked Fenghua and dropped 7 bombs, destroying more than 30 houses and causing more than 20 casualties; (4) On the 6th, 3 Japanese aircraft attacked Yuyao and dropped 6 bombs, injuring 3 people and destroying more than 20 houses; (5) At 2:00 pm on the 7th, three Japanese warships arrived at the Hai Men waters in eastern Zhejiang, first launching speedboats to patrol and spy along the coast, and fired more than ten shells at the shore; (6) On the morning of the 8th, 6 Japanese aircraft attacked Zhenhai again and dropped more than 20 bombs. Although various counties are being bombed from time to time, casualties are not many because residents are dispersed in various villages during the day and return to the city at night. The overall situation is still calm.</p>
<p>Airfields Destroyed</p>
<p>The airfield outside the South Gate of Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft last year, and was subsequently automatically destroyed. Japanese aircraft did not disturb it. It is now reported that the Ningbo Defense Department has ordered the Yinxian County Government to thoroughly destroy the airfield and allocate the land to residents for cultivation.</p>
<p>Two Puppet Officials in Caohejing Executed by Japanese Army, Yang Jinsheng and Zhang Gengquan Aided the Enemy's Tyranny, Such an Ending Pleases the People</p>
<p>The Daguan News Agency reported that, according to people from Caohejing in western Shanghai, a small team of Japanese troops, fifty or sixty in number, and puppet police are stationed and patrolling there. Recently, in order to prevent guerrilla activities, security has been tightened. During the day, Japanese and puppet troops set up picket lines more than ten li away and search passing pedestrians. They sometimes invade people's houses and search them, causing unrest among residents. Yang Jinsheng and Zhang Gengquan, local people living near the Huangjia Garden, usually did not abide by their duties, were idle, and exploited the villagers. After Caohejing was occupied, Yang and Zhang suddenly claimed to be maintaining local order and contacted the Japanese army. They were appointed to puppet positions and gathered followers to organize "agencies," creating various pretexts to extort donations and assisting the enemy's tyranny, committing numerous evil deeds. The people were oppressed and dared not speak out. Unexpectedly, Yang and Zhang, with their overflowing evil deeds, were suddenly arrested by the Japanese army a few days ago. They were accused of encroaching on tax funds. After an interrogation, they were deemed to be guilty and sentenced to death. They have already been executed by firing squad. The ending of those who shamelessly served the enemy pleases the people.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Industry Develops Abnormally, Printing, Dyeing, Weaving, Pharmaceutical, and Knitting Industries Small in Scale but Highly Profitable</p>
<p>Shanghai is an international hub, and the prosperity of its business can be imagined. However, due to the opening of seaports and the competition of foreign goods, the national goods industry has developed rapidly in recent years. Some invested capital to build factories, start production, and ship goods. Others expanded their scope, increased production, and improved quality. There are countless such examples. Chinese people are happy to purchase and use national goods because of their low price and good quality. National goods companies and national goods commercial centers have been established one after another, and their business is not inferior to that of foreign goods markets. However, since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Pudong, Zhabei, and Nanshi have been reduced to war zones. These three places were the center of various industries, and it was impossible to start work for a while. In addition to evacuating workers, machines and means of production could not be moved out and were destroyed under artillery fire. Now, Shanghai's industries have recovered, the city appearance is prosperous, the population has increased sharply, and the sales of daily necessities in the market are active. Therefore, industrial leaders have found ways to establish factories and start work in safe areas. However, the scale is smaller, and the profits are quite high. It is reported that the development of these emerging industries is most prominent in printing, dyeing, weaving, enamel, glass, electrical machinery, silk weaving, monosodium glutamate, cosmetics, soap, pharmaceuticals, knitting, and silk reeling. Among them, silk reeling factories are the most difficult. Although fresh cocoons have been listed in various places, they are all prohibited from being transported to Shanghai, resulting in the exhaustion of raw materials and the inability to start work.</p>
<p>Japanese Acknowledge Guerrilla Warfare in the Suburbs</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Pao reported that a Japanese Army spokesperson claimed at a press conference yesterday (the 8th) that the Japanese army received information that the Chinese army of the 54th Division, which is active southwest of Shanghai, planned to launch an attack on the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, it launched a surprise attack on July 6th and fought at Zhangliangting (transliteration), 16 kilometers southwest of Qingpu. One Japanese soldier was injured. On the night of July 6th to 7th, guerrillas around Shanghai also had minor contact with the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Gunfire Resumes in Beixinjing, Although Ferry Crossing Has Been Opened, Ferry Service Has Not Yet Resumed</p>
<p>According to boatmen from Beixinjing who arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 9th, there was dense gunfire and small mortar fire in the Beixinjing area at around 12:00 pm on the 8th. The source of the gunfire could not be determined due to traffic obstruction. Ferry service from the concession to Beixinjing has also been suspended due to the blockade of the Beixinjing ferry crossing. Although the ferry crossing has been opened, the ferry service has not yet been resumed, as security there has not been relaxed.</p>

<p>Barbers from Northern Jiangsu mostly practice massage and cupping. Now that it is summer, illnesses from heatstroke are prevalent. However, these barbers have no medical knowledge. Their treatment of heatstroke is nothing more than following their masters, rashly performing acupuncture, often resulting in accidents due to poor surgery. Since heatstroke is unavoidable during the hot summer months, unscientific acupuncture should be discarded, and one should not try it lightly. However, there is a Yangzhou barber named Chen Delong</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Inside and Outside Fake and Obsolete Banknote Exhibition (Xue Wen) Open to the Public for One Week Starting Today The Displayed Fake and Obsolete Notes are Worth 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Have you ever used a fake banknote? Imagine you are in a hurry to buy something, and when you hand over the banknote, the person touches it, holds it up to the light, and says, "This is a fake note. Please exchange it." Sometimes, they might even suspect you are an "expert" in using "fake notes," and you might end up blushing with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Therefore, having some basic knowledge of how to identify genuine and fake banknotes is essential for everyone. Many people have suffered losses because they don't know how to recognize banknotes, which is a very "unpleasant" thing.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to introduce readers to an exhibition of fake and obsolete banknotes. Take this opportunity to spend a few tens of minutes training yourself and use your own judgment to see the true face of fake banknotes. The exhibition starts today and lasts for one week.</p>
<p>The exhibition is organized by the Shanghai Money Exchange Industry Association, located at 50 Dong Qingyuan Lane, Henan Road, Beijing Road. This association has only been established for over three months, and it already has four to five hundred members.</p>
<p>They have established a friendly relationship with the Silver and Money Industry Association and could have merged, but due to various customary reasons, they have this association organization under the Money Exchange Guild.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhu Lizhi, the person in charge of the association, the various fake and obsolete banknotes displayed in the exhibition are worth about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. This is only a part of the collected fake and obsolete banknotes. The total value of all the fake and obsolete banknotes is over 223,000 yuan. If they were all genuine and currently in circulation, it would be a small fortune.</p>
<p>There is no admission fee during the exhibition period. After the exhibition ends, they plan to hold a larger exhibition in the middle of August, during the cool autumn months, at the Great World amusement center. All proceeds will be donated to refugee relief.</p>
<p>How to Identify Fake Banknotes</p>
<p>The fake and obsolete banknotes on display can be divided into four categories: (1) Fake notes; (2) Obsolete notes; (3) Valuable notes; (4) Foreign banknotes.</p>
<p>There are many types of fake banknotes. Almost all banknotes issued by various banks in circulation in the market have counterfeit versions. For example, fake banknotes exist for banks such as the Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Siming Bank, Farmers Bank, Zhongnan Bank, and Zhongshi Bank.</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Fang, another person in charge at the exhibition, about the methods for identifying fake banknotes. He said that it is actually not difficult and can generally be divided into several types: (1) Blurry printing; (2) Different colors; (3) Rough and thin paper; (4) Poor printing of certain special patterns. If you carefully examine them, you can immediately distinguish between genuine and fake.</p>
<p>As for "altered notes" and "split notes," you need to be especially careful.</p>
<p>The exhibition includes these two types of banknotes: (1) Genuine banknotes are torn into two pieces, one side facing up and one side facing down, and then a fake printed single-sided counterfeit banknote is glued on, creating two banknotes. These two banknotes are genuine on one side and fake on the other. A slight oversight and you will surely "swallow" them; (2) So-called altered notes also come in two types: The first type involves changing the numerals. For example, originally a one-yuan note, they try to erase the one and change it to five or ten yuan. The second type involves changing the name of a non-circulating bank. If you are not careful, it will slip into your pocket.</p>
<p>Military Warlords Issuing Obsolete Banknotes</p>
<p>During the warlord era, warlords such as Zhang Zongchang, Cao Kun, and Wu Peifu printed and issued their own banknotes and military tickets to plunder the people's cash. These banknotes all became obsolete after the revolution. Although these obsolete banknotes were abolished, the warlords plundered a large amount of silver dollars.</p>
<p>There are many types of obsolete banknotes. In addition to the three people mentioned above, there are also banknotes issued by Zhang Zuolin in the Northeast in the first year of the Republic of China; Guangdong Provincial Bank exchange coupons issued by Chen Jiongming in Guangdong;</p>
<p>Banknotes issued by the Sino-Japanese Joint Venture China Exchange Bank in the ninth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>China's Earliest Banknotes</p>
<p>Among the valuable banknotes, there are the first official banknotes issued in China, which were issued in November of the 24th year of the Guangxu reign. The issuing bank was the China General Commercial Bank, and they were then called Chinese Money Tickets.</p>
<p>The second type was issued in the first year of the Xuantong reign and was called the Daqing Bank Exchange Coupon. The face value was one tael, but it was only valid in the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>There is also an even more precious one-thousand-wen banknote issued during the Qianlong era, which depicts two dragons playing with a pearl. It is a rare item, but unfortunately, it was not displayed this time.</p>
<p>Rubles, Marks, and Public Bonds</p>
<p>Among the foreign banknotes, there are rubles from the era of the old Russian Tsar; a 100-dollar counterfeit banknote from the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation; a 20-dollar counterfeit banknote from Citibank (which would be worth 160 yuan if genuine); marks from before the German Revolution; 1,000 rubles issued during the beginning of the Russian Communist era (1917); and public bonds issued by the current Soviet government.</p>
<p>Looking at the number and types of fake, obsolete, and valuable banknotes currently on display, it seems that there are many more types that have not been collected. However, just looking at the part that is currently on display is indeed enough to keep you lingering for half an hour. Readers who are interested in fake and obsolete banknotes may wish to take some time to make a pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>In "After the Rain, the Sky Clears" (155), line 7, "We are the sole hegemons," "sole hegemons" is a mistake for "candle hegemons." Line 20, "This year, more than 60 agricultural science students graduated," "60" is a mistake for "6,000." We hereby correct these errors.</p>

<p>Chapter 13 Encourage Learning and Farming to Store Talent for the Country Retain the Strong and Eliminate the Weak to Select Seeds in the Field</p>
<p>Director Ge said, "In order to recruit more students, we need to produce more silkworm eggs every year, and the existing buildings are not enough. Therefore, I discussed with Village Chief Zhu about renting more than five mu of land to the west of our current location, up to a mountain stream, from the village." Village Chief Zhu said, "This is for the development of the silk industry, and it will definitely be approved. It is an honor for our Freedom Village that the seeds and talents from our seed production field are developed and spread to other places." Director Ge said, "That's one thing. Another thing is that I attended a sericulture conference at the Provincial Department of Agriculture two weeks ago. Because there are more and more silkworm-raising areas in the inland provinces, they all come to us to buy mulberry seedlings, and we have some difficulty meeting the demand. Later, it was decided that each silkworm egg production field should be attached to a specialized mulberry tree nursery. Fortunately, all the directors of the silkworm egg production fields are from sericulture backgrounds, and none of them are unaware of how to plant mulberry trees. However, the location of the nursery needs to be found by each director themselves. In short, it should not be too far from the seed production field so that it can be taken care of nearby. Moreover, students can be led to teach them how to plant, sow, fertilize, and manage soil and pests, all of which can be learned in practice. Therefore, we also need a large field to plant mulberry seedlings." Village Chief Zhu pondered and said, "This needs to be discussed." Originally, there were also silkworm-raising families and many mulberry fields in Freedom Village, but such a large nursery was not within their land development budget. Director Ge said, "I have already found a location for the nursery, not in this village, but in Shuizhu Village. There is a large piece of land that can be used as a nursery. I have already gone to see it and discussed it with Mrs. Xu, the village chief. Of course, they also need to be decided by the village council, but the big picture is not a problem. Although we have to cross a river to get to Shuizhu Village, it is not inconvenient. Even if we don't take the Xie Martyrs Bridge and use a ferry to cross to the other side, it is very convenient. Because this place is not far from the canal on the opposite side, taking the Xie Martyrs Bridge is actually a bit further. We have plenty of boats, and there are also many boats for transporting mulberry leaves during the busy season of silkworm raising! In the future, for convenience, we may open a road from the landing point to the nursery. Or, we can set up a ferry on both the upper and lower banks for easy access. This matter should also be reported to Village Chief Zhu, so I originally wanted to visit you for this purpose. It is just as well that you have come here, sir." It is truly said:</p>
<p>In modern times, many women are elegant and accomplished.</p>

<p>Shanghai Prices Sixty Years Ago Mei</p>
<p>I accidentally came across an old newspaper and discovered</p>
<p>Shanghai concession prices sixty years ago, the value of which was so low that</p>
<p>Compared to current prices, they are as different as heaven and earth.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Tiansheng Daily, issue 174, of 1878 (i.e., the 18th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty), the prices at that time were as follows: (However, because it was based on cash coins, it has been converted into legal currency.)</p>
<p>White rice: 1.3 yuan per shi</p>
<p>Salt: 1 yuan per dan</p>
<p>Chicken: 8 fen per jin</p>
<p>Duck: 7 fen per jin</p>
<p>Beef: 6 fen per jin</p>
<p>Flour: 3 fen per jin</p>
<p>Eggs: 4.5 jiao per hundred</p>
<p>Pork: 9 fen per jin</p>
<p>Sugar: 2 fen per jin</p>
<p>Soy sauce: 2.5 fen per jin</p>
<p>Soybean oil: 2 fen per jin</p>
<p>Dried bamboo shoots: 3 fen per jin</p>
<p>Black dates: 2 fen per jin</p>
<p>Ham: 3.5 jiao per piece</p>
<p>If the above prices are compared with the current prices, they cannot be measured in any way. However, if we wait another sixty years, who knows how much higher the prices will be?</p>
<p>Local Martial Arts Groups Hold Third Tea Party Yalu</p>
<p>Discussing the popularization of martial arts using the "Little Teacher System"</p>
<p>Entertainment includes "musical saw" and mixed chorus by Yiyou Society members</p>
<p>Local martial arts groups have always lacked communication, and the scattered state is enough to make martial arts decline. Therefore, several advanced groups in the martial arts community have seen this shortcoming and initiated a "Shanghai Martial Arts Tea Party" to awaken the unity of the martial arts community and further improve various problems in martial arts. Each tea party is convened by each martial arts group in turn, and each participant pays a tea fee of two jiao. The first and second tea parties have already been convened by the Jingwu Athletic Association and the Silver Industry Association. Yesterday was the third tea party, held by Yiyou Society at the University Joint Dining Hall of Cishu Building, with the participation of fifteen groups and about one hundred and thirty people.</p>
<p>I have participated in the previous two tea parties, but I feel that yesterday's third tea party showed more significant progress in the spirit of unity, and both the speeches, the issues discussed, and the entertainment were very meaningful. As far as memory serves, I have written them down below as a memorial and reference.</p>
<p>The meeting started at nine o'clock, first with a speech by Mr. Tang Hao, a former senior official of the Shanghai Martial Arts Museum and now a lawyer, on the topic of "Hypnosis and Martial Arts." Mr. Tang has a deep understanding of this subject, but his research is based on science and psychology, so his conclusion is that hypnotism is not metaphysics but science, not theology but related to psychology, and has a close relationship and effect with martial arts. Mr. Tang also cited many facts and theories in this regard, but unfortunately, due to space limitations, I cannot record them in detail.</p>
<p>After Mr. Tang finished speaking, because the people who were participating in the entertainment had something to do and needed to leave early, they requested to perform in advance. Therefore, the entertainment program followed.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Lu performed a novel performance called "Musical Saw," which involves pulling the bow of a erhu on the teeth of a steel saw (i.e., the one used by carpenters) to produce the tones of various songs. Although the sound is a bit low, the elegant and harmonious rhythm is still quite memorable. Amidst the applause, the next program was a mixed chorus by the Yiyou Society singing group.</p>
<p>After the singing program, the discussion began on the issue of "How to Popularize Martial Arts." After summarizing everyone's opinions, the following five issues must be resolved first: (1) Funding issues; (2) Venue issues; (3) Teaching material issues; (4) Centralization issues; (5) Ideological issues. Because of the limited time, and because everyone did not prepare sufficiently for this topic in advance, it was impossible to obtain a satisfactory conclusion immediately. Therefore, Mr. Xu Wenxuan of Yiyou Society, in order to discuss a preliminary method for promoting the "popularization of martial arts," proposed adopting the "Little Teacher System." He said: Because of the current difficulties in the Shanghai environment, it is really not easy to solve the above five issues in order to popularize martial arts. Moreover, there are at most only five hundred people in Shanghai who are proficient in martial arts. Based on this ratio to the population, it is impossible for each person to teach 10,000 people to popularize martial arts. Therefore, the purpose of adopting the "Little Teacher System" is to hope that comrades who have studied martial arts for two or three months will pass on what they have learned to others, or use persuasive methods to get relatives and friends to learn martial arts. In this way, one person teaches ten, and ten teach one hundred, expanding broadly, and it will not be difficult for martial arts to gradually become popular.</p>
<p>Finally, everyone passed Mr. Xu's proposal, and each group automatically recommended a person in charge to host this matter, and continued to discuss it in the next tea party with a written plan.</p>
<p>A meaningful tea party, whether from the perspective of promoting social evolution or from the perspective of benefiting personal physical and mental health, is worthy of promotion. Moreover, martial arts can train people to become healthy physiques and personalities, thereby improving our production efficiency.</p>
<p>Sea Hell Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Pacific Liner"</p>
<p>Produced by RKO Pictures</p>
<p>Showing at the Grand Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>The story of "Sea Hell" is not bad. A ship's doctor treats cholera among the stokers in difficult circumstances, and the chief engineer works despite his illness to get the ship ashore as soon as possible and prevent the epidemic in the hold from spreading to passengers. This illustrates that anyone engaged in any profession should have a sense of responsibility, and good results can only be achieved through cooperation.</p>
<p>However, the play does not have careful scene division, and because the entire background of the film is on a ship, all that is seen is the appearance and disappearance of the characters, and no "drama" is seen.</p>
<p>The biggest shortcoming is still the clumsy directing technique. The chief engineer's "deep respect from the stokers" was not clearly written in the front, so when the stokers want to rush to the deck, the chief engineer's order for them to work seems weak. Moreover, as the stokers die one by one, and everyone is determined to go to the deck, the director only slowly withdraws the fire shovel in the furnace and uses close-ups of the faces of each stoker, which is not enough to describe the uncontrollable emotions at the time.</p>
<p>Victor McLaglen's scene of working hard to add coal in the hold as the chief engineer is very moving, but the director simply did not give Chester Morris as the doctor and Wendy Barrie as the nurse a good chance to act.</p>

<p>Zhenhai Fort</p>
<p>Zhenhai Fort will be renovated, and a candidate magistrate has been dispatched to investigate and manage it. Someone may offer a plan and show a good strategy. The magistrate replied, "Although the method is good, what if there is no silver to pay for it!" Westerners passing on this matter smiled and said, "If the high-ranking officials bring their followers, and their hats and boots are magnificent, they plan to pass by this abandoned fort, so they order more than ten workers to sweep all corners of the fort with new brooms, and the fort will be brand new." Westerners are a little too sarcastic about this matter! However, this fort is too old and rotten, and it is really necessary to repair it properly.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Bureau Recruits Soldiers</p>
<p>The Manufacturing Bureau is recruiting soldiers for the foreign gun team, but military orders do not allow those who smoke opium to enlist. It is said that among the hundred applicants the other day, after verifying and eliminating smokers, only fifteen people remained. Alas! The harm of opium is so deep. In the past, these people devoted their efforts to the frontier and risked their lives, but unexpectedly, today they are trapped by opium, burying heroes. I don't know how many, which is truly sigh-worthy! Among them, there is one person who can play the bugle, but he is also addicted to opium, so the vacancy for the bugler cannot be filled for the time being, so he was temporarily selected.</p>
<p>Poetic Verses from the Yuwang Temple Oracle</p>
<p>Mount Asoka, located in the northeast of Ningbo Prefecture, is towering for thousands of feet. The Asoka Temple is built on top of it, with clear and serene Sanskrit characters, making it the crown of the prefecture. The abbot, Reverend Wuyun, has strict precepts and frequently interacts with men of letters. This summer, some people who were avoiding the heat in the temple, lit incense and set up a planchette on the fifteenth day of the fifth month, to invite the descent of the spirit. The Great Immortal Yuanzhen Taoist descended to the altar, and the crowd asked about recent events in Japan. The planchette quickly wrote a poem: "When the sun rises from the waves, the sky and the earth shake, and the battleships fly across, how heroic! But watch the first, second, fourth, and third day, there will surely be a dragon-slaying general to come." Examining the poem in detail, it seems that the Eastern people are not to be feared.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Military dispatch: Fierce fighting continues in the vicinity of Huicheng, Jiangmen. Chinese forces have destroyed the Shatou-Daliang highway to impede Japanese transport. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: Chinese troops have launched fierce attacks on Jiangmen for days, inflicting heavy casualties on Japanese and puppet troops. They appear to be preparing to retreat. Three Japanese transport ships were discovered on the Beijie River on the morning of the 5th. At 4:00 AM, one Japanese ship sailed to Liyu Sha, shelling Chaolian over ten times before returning to Beijie. (9th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The situation in central Hubei, apart from sporadic guerrilla warfare, remains deadlocked as it was before the major battle. (9th)</p>
<p>Jinhua: At 4:00 AM on the 9th, Japanese planes attacked Yuhuan again, advancing towards Shangzhuang. Five Japanese warships and four planes provided cover for over 400 Japanese troops, who launched a three-pronged attack. Chinese troops are putting up a strong resistance against the Japanese at Meidao. As of 8:00 PM, fierce fighting continues. (9th)</p>
<p>Jinhua: The Japanese troops who invaded Shitan Town, which belongs to Wenling County, have recently been building fortifications, intending to hold their ground. At 1:00 PM on the 8th, Chinese troops launched a major counter-offensive. The Japanese troops resisted stubbornly, but after a fierce Chinese assault, they were unable to hold and a portion retreated to ships. The remaining two hundred-odd troops went to Ruoshan. Currently, there are no traces of the Japanese in Shitan. There are nine large Japanese ships, three small ships, and two ships each in the waters of Huangda Ao and Xiaomen Mountain. There are varying numbers, between three and five ships, in the waters off Damenshan. (9th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Japanese army launched a second attack on Pingtan on the 5th. That morning, they used motorboats to transport several hundred Japanese and puppet troops, and under the cover of naval vessels and aircraft, secretly landed simultaneously at Dongliu and Liushui on the island. Local Chinese self-defense teams immediately rushed to intercept them, resulting in fierce fighting. The next day, many Japanese planes wildly bombed the county seat all day long. The number of Japanese ships on the sea also increased to seven. The number of landed Japanese troops continued to increase. Street fighting broke out in the county seat. After two days of hard fighting, the Chinese troops shifted their defenses to continue the struggle. The residents of the city retreated to safe areas in advance. (9th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Pingtan Island is isolated in the sea off Fuqing and is also one of the larger islands among the northern and southern islands of Min Estuary. The Chinese side had not fortified it, leading to the Japanese coveting it. Since a large number of Japanese troops secretly landed on the island on the 5th, the local Chinese self-defense teams, although bravely intercepting them, were ultimately unable to prevent the Japanese from taking the city because the county seat was very close to the coast, allowing the Japanese to use naval gunfire for cover. However, although the Chinese troops temporarily withdrew from the city, not a single person crossed the sea, vowing to stay on the isolated island and fight the Japanese to the end. (9th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news from the Chinese side today, the Japanese side has launched a new offensive in southern Shanxi. On the morning of the 7th, fighting was extremely fierce in the Hejia Village area. Both sides suffered very heavy casualties. However, although the two sides are currently engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat, there will likely be no major decision in the next two or three days. (9th, Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Central Government Holds Northern Expedition Swearing-In Anniversary; President Chiang Personally Chairs the Gathering; Tea Party Held to Host Government Officials</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, the 9th, is the anniversary of the swearing-in of the National Revolutionary Army for the Northern Expedition. The Central National Government jointly held a memorial meeting at 8:00 AM. Over 400 members of the Central National Government Committee and party, government, and military officials attended. President Chiang personally chaired the meeting, and the ceremony was performed as prescribed. Subsequently, Committee Member Wu Jingheng reported on the significance of Premier Sun Yat-sen completing the National Revolution in thirty years. After the meeting, President Chiang held a tea party to host party, government, and military officials and expressed his views, stating in brief that when the party swore in troops for the Northern Expedition, relying on the struggle and sacrifice of all officers, soldiers, and compatriots, it was able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and unify the country. The purpose of the Northern Expedition was not only to defeat Beiping, but also to solve China's problems and seek China's freedom and equality. Looking back thirteen years, our material and strength were far inferior to the Northern Warlords, and there were even those who lacked revolutionary awareness and attempted to hinder the Northern Expedition by any means. However, the proposition of the Northern Expedition was finally realized because revolutionary comrades had a clear understanding of the doctrine, so they were able to fight forward without fear of difficulties, and all obstacles were finally destroyed one by one. Revolution lies entirely in spirit and faith. If one has a spirit of great fearlessness and strong confidence, one will succeed no matter what difficulties are encountered. Today, as we commemorate the Northern Expedition Swearing-In, we recall the heroic sacrifices of the officers, soldiers, and compatriots at that time, which are as vivid as if they were happening right before our eyes. We can only strengthen our resolve and fight forward to complete the full success of the revolution, so as not to be ashamed of the responsibility of those who come after us. History is the most credible lesson, and only history can serve as our guide to struggle. By comparing the past with the present, we will be able to follow the same course to achieve our goals. (9th)</p>
<p>(Guiyang) Various circles in Guizhou held a Northern Expedition Swearing-In Anniversary rally this morning and paid tribute to the fallen soldiers in various revolutionary battles. Over 500 people participated, and the atmosphere was solemn and tragic. (9th)</p>

The situation is still deadlocked. The county seat of Lianshui was attacked again and engaged in street fighting with Japanese troops for two days and nights. Seven to eight hundred Japanese troops and over ten tanks and armored vehicles coming from Huaiyin were intercepted by Chinese troops at Qi'an Yangzhuang and other places. The Japanese army suffered over a hundred casualties. Later, due to the Japanese army's fierce momentum, they broke through and counterattacked the Chinese forces. The Chinese army resisted bravely, and the fighting was even more intense. Brigade Commander Song personally entered Lianshui city to command, but suffered heavy casualties due to the heavy Japanese artillery fire. On the evening of the 2nd, he reluctantly withdrew, shifting his forces to the outskirts of the city to defend. (8th)</p>

<h3>Nomonhan War Intensifies; Small Hill Northwest of Hulun Becomes Target of Struggle; Soviet Artillery Accurate; Japanese Aircraft Conduct Frenzied Bombing</h3>
<p>Manchuria-Mongolia Front: The Nomonhan war continues, intensifying. The small hill of Nomonhan is the target of attack by both Mongolian and Japanese forces. The scope of the war is similar to the Zhanggufeng Incident last summer. Both sides are currently using aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery to desperately compete for this small hill 160 miles northwest of Hulun. The summit of the hill remains a no-man's land. Mongolian troops are holding firm to the western end of the hill under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire. A small group of Mongolian troops, under heavy Japanese artillery fire, forcibly crossed the Khalkhyn Gol River and are now rapidly advancing to reinforce friendly forces guarding below the hill of Nomonhan. Near the bend of the Khalkhyn Gol River is a lower hill called Nuolu (transliteration) Highland, which is said to have been surrounded by Japanese troops. Trench warfare has now developed. Both sides have dug trenches and are holding their ground. The impression obtained by the reporter is that the Japanese army's earlier expectations of taking advantage of their victory and continuing to win have not been realized due to the Mongolian counterattack. Although the Mongolian army has suffered many losses due to Japanese bombardment, it has been able to use the bridges across the Khalkhyn Gol River, using the darkness as cover, to send reinforcements to the front line to assist 4,000 friendly forces in danger of being surrounded by the Japanese army. Japanese troops coming from the north and from Haruna Mountain (transliteration) are now planning to encircle these 4,000 Mongolian troops. Haruna Mountain is at the southernmost end of the front line and is the terminus of the Changchun-Haruna Mountain railway. The reporter saw several cars of wounded soldiers today, proving the intensity of the fighting. This kind of fierce battle will be prolonged due to the arrival of new Soviet troops. Senior Japanese military officers recently declared that 60,000 Soviet troops from the Baikal region have now arrived and are stationed in the areas behind the front line. The rumor that the Soviet Union is planning to conduct activities in other border areas to contain the Japanese army is not worth taking seriously, they said. The Japanese army initially achieved victory, but progress has been slow, reportedly due to transportation difficulties and a lack of mechanized units. It is now understood that mechanized units are being reinforced, and at the same time, infantry strength is also being increased. There are two prominent features in this war. One is the accuracy of the Soviet artillery and the other is the bombing conducted by Japanese aircraft. According to the Japanese side, since the start of the war, they have destroyed 250 Mongolian tanks and armored cars and captured about 60 Soviet prisoners. However, the reporter was unable to personally confirm these numbers due to transportation difficulties in the frontline area. (8th, Reuters Special Correspondent)</p>
<p>Frontline Dispatch: Last night, in a heavy thunderstorm, the Japanese army broke through the Mongolian army's outposts. The Soviet-Mongolian army retreated westward. At dawn, the Japanese right wing had secured a strong position one mile from Hailar. The left wing, composed of a mixed organization of "Manchukuo" Inner Mongolian and Japanese troops, was three miles from the city, with Hailar as its bowstring. It is now believed that the 2,000-odd Mongolian troops who are still fighting bravely in the area may complete their retreat tonight due to the Japanese victory, as their only retreat route is a bridge that has been repeatedly bombed by the Japanese during the day. According to a Japanese military spokesman, once the Soviet-Mongolian army withdraws and the Japanese army recovers all the territory east of Hailar, they will stop their actions. The Japanese army has no intention of invading Mongolian territory, he said. At the same time, Soviet artillery is currently bombarding the Japanese army with accurate fire, causing the final stage of the advance to be delayed. At present, the confluence of the Kerulen and Khalkhyn Gol rivers is under direct Japanese surveillance, as they are slowly advancing despite being threatened by heavy Soviet artillery fire. This Japanese decision has been quite rewarding, and 60 prisoners have been captured and sent to the frontline reception center. It is said that more are continuing to be sent. The reporter spoke with two of the twenty prisoners and learned that they were captured by Japanese tank teams. One was an infantryman, aged 20, and the other was a member of the labor team attached to a certain artillery division, aged 25. Both had only recently joined the war and had only arrived at the front line 24 hours before being captured. According to the infantryman, he was transferred from Ulaanbaatar to the front line and was completely unaware of the destination or the reason for the deployment. He was not even told that there was a war, he said. The member of the labor team said that he enlisted in May and was immediately sent to Mongolia. The reporter witnessed many coffins wrapped in white cloth, containing the bodies of White Russian soldiers killed in action, being transported to Hailar for burial. Later, the reporter met with a certain Japanese air force authority, who said that the main reason for the great victory of the Japanese aircraft was the superiority of the Japanese pilots and the poor maneuverability of the Soviet aircraft. Although many enemy aircraft were shot down within Manchuria, it was not worth the risk to search for the wreckage of each aircraft in order to verify the accuracy of the figures released by the Japanese side, as all areas were under artillery bombardment, he said. According to the Japanese side, the total number of enemy aircraft completely destroyed is 400, which is actually more than twice the original strength of the Outer Mongolian air force. The reporter witnessed one destroyed aircraft, which was said to be an SB bomber. However, because there was very little left of the wreckage of the aircraft, its identity could not be confirmed. The reporter asked where the most fighting had occurred. The reply was that most of the fighting occurred over Lake Buir, but at present, it is impossible to travel there by land due to heavy rain and desolation. The spokesman also said that the altitude at which both sides flew during the fighting was between 12,000 and 15,000 feet. Japanese pilots were often able to fight selflessly in intense battles. Some of the Soviet aircraft were TKB or fighter planes with speeds of 370 to 490 miles per hour. (8th, Reuters Special Correspondent)</p>
<p>Frontline Dispatch: Yesterday, 40 Soviet aircraft bombed Manchuria in two batches, one place 40 kilometers from Hailar and the other 6 kilometers from the city. Most of the bombs fell on vacant land, and the area suffered no damage. After dropping their bombs, the aircraft flew back. It is said that the real purpose of the Soviets' hasty bombing was to divert the Japanese army's attention so that the retreating Soviet-Mongolian army could avoid being bombed by Japanese aircraft.

<p>British Newspaper Commentary: Future of Aggressor Nation Bleak; The Deeper Japan Advances, the Greater the Difficulties; Has Fallen into a Dilemma</p>
<p>(London) The third year of the Sino-Japanese war began today. The Sunday Times recently published a commentary, saying: "China is emulating Russia's approach to Napoleon, implementing a 'scorched earth policy,' so that the victors gain very little. The casualties in this war are unprecedented in history. In addition to those killed in battle and ordinary people who have been tragically bombed by Japanese aircraft, the number of people who have died from famine, floods, and epidemics is in the millions. However, as of now, there is no hope for peace. On the Chinese side, what is seen is far-sighted, knowing the advantage of gaining time. Therefore, although they have suffered greatly, they have not succumbed. Looking back at Japan, its future is becoming increasingly bleak. As the country is clearly an aggressor, the atrocities committed by its soldiers have caused everyone within China to be hostile to it. Therefore, morally speaking, Japan has no place to stand. The deeper it advances in the future, the greater its difficulties. In a word, it has actually fallen into a dilemma. It is not surprising that the impatient people of that country, in despair, want to expand the scope of the conflict to cover up their failure, and are ignorant of blaming themselves, only knowing to vent their anger on Britain and other countries."

<h3>Chen Guangfu Negotiating New Loan in the United States; Financial Advisor Baker Has Been Urgently Summoned to Attend</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reliable sources, Baker, the financial advisor to the Chinese government, has, in response to an urgent call from Chen Guangfu, the Chinese representative in the United States, flown to Hong Kong by plane two days ago, and will change to the "China Clipper" for a direct flight to New York. It is said that Chen Guangfu is currently negotiating a new loan with the US side and needs to consult Baker's opinion. It is said that Baker is an agricultural expert. After recently inspecting the situation in the southeastern provinces, he went to Chongqing from Haiphong. It is thought he has an important plan to propose to the Chinese side.

<h3>National Government Revises and Promulgates Wartime Excess Profits Tax; Collected by the Income Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The National Government today announced a new tax, named the Wartime Excess Profits Tax. Its regulations stipulate that this new tax is to be paid in addition to income tax. All commercial and industrial enterprises invested in by the government, privately, or jointly, with capital exceeding 2,000 yuan, whose profits exceed 20% of the capital, are required to pay this new tax. Profits from rent or property income that exceed 15% of the property value are also subject to this new tax. The tax should be considered a central government tax and collected by the Income Tax Bureau. The collection of the new tax should be calculated from January 1 of this year and paid annually or monthly according to the nature of the profits. The tax rate is determined by the ratio of profits to capital. Profits reaching 20% to 25% of the capital will be taxed at 10%. Profits from 25% to 30% will be taxed at 15%. 30% to 40% will be taxed at 20%. 45% to 50% will be taxed at 30%. 50% to 60% will be taxed at 40%. Above 60% will be taxed at 50%. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The regulations for the Wartime Excess Profits Tax, created this year, have been re-revised and promulgated by the Chinese government today, stipulating (1) that all commercial enterprises, whether semi-official or private, with capital exceeding 2,000 yuan and profits exceeding 20%, are subject to it; (2) that rents exceeding 15% are also subject to taxation; (3) that the income tax is fully applicable to wartime excess profits. The purpose of this tax is purely to prevent bribery for those who seek to enjoy large profits by taking advantage of extraordinary times. (9th, Associated Press)</p>
