<p>〔本報重慶十一日電〕（一）政治協商會議，昨日僅舉行開幕儀式，實際議程，今日始能開始。會議定於每日上午舉行，俾各代表能於下午從事會外之活動，及意見之交換。今日因參政會駐會委員會定於上午開會，其中一部分代表，須往參加，故將今日之首次正式會議，改在下午三時開始，首先討論與停戰之問題。協商會議揭幕時，蔣主席首先宣布頒發停戰令，及政府決定保障人民自由，承認政黨合法地位，實行普選，及釋放政治犯等新措施，僉認爲已給與協商會議一極良好之開端。關於政府改組，國大代表等問題，各方意見雖有不同，但距離亦不太遠，不難折衷，故一般對協商之進行，多持樂觀之態度。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十一日電〕（二）軍畫調處執行部聞最近即成立，以執行停止軍事衝突協商之規定。據消息靈通人士稱：執行部三委員中，美國代表除使館代辦羅賓遜外，以華北美軍總司令駱基中將可能性最大，中共代表已定為葉劍英氏。政府代表聞已決定，為軍令部第二廳長鄭介民氏云。又據關係方面息：馬歇爾元帥於日內飛平。</p>

<h3>軍隊必須國家化　政府主張設三人小組討論　陸總部已令執行停止衝突</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十一日電〕今日政治協商會議舉行第一次會議，當時政府與共產黨代表，對軍隊國家化問題，由協商會議討論抑由三人小組委員會討論，曾發生熱烈爭論。十月十日發表之聯合公報，曾規定設立三人小組委員會，政府固守原來計劃，但共產黨則堅持由協商會議討論。三人委會國府代表張羣，報告會談經過，提議設立一小組委員會，研討共軍改組問題。共黨代表周恩來，對於會談情形，亦有所報告，渠反對張羣之提議，認爲共軍之改組問題，應由政治協商會議考慮。外長王世杰，則力促周氏接受張羣之提議。靑年黨領袖曾琦，支持政府之計劃，建議由政治協商會議草擬一廣泛之綱領，至於改組之措施，則另由一小組委會實施。周恩來於是提議該會應研討所有一切軍隊改組問題。</p>
<p>〔又電〕隨美駐華特使抵渝之美國大使館陸軍武官白魯德上校，於今日乘機離渝飛平，從事設立執行停戰協定之軍事調處執行部，白氏或將被任爲該部執行組之主任。美代理大使羅勃遜將於最近將來離渝赴平。</p>

<p>〔聯合社重慶十一日電〕政治協商會議，國民黨代表現正依照上年十二月十五日美國總統杜魯門之對華政策宣言，草擬正式提案，以擴大政府基礎。據立法院長孫科發表該方案大綱將爲：（一）改組國府會議，使成爲訂定及指導最高政策之當局，羅致其他各黨代表為委員；（二）就各黨領袖中增設各國府委長，在行政院給予席次。此項部長或有專任狀，或任不管部長。該案可望於數日內提出現在此間舉行之政治協商會議。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾舞伴　杭立武夫人</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十一日電〕今日在重慶最爲人羨慕之女性，當爲敎育部次長杭立武之夫人。渠爲唯一與美特使馬歇爾同舞之一人。昨晚重慶婦女慰勞總會於盟軍將官招待會中，馬帥曾偕杭夫人婆娑起舞。馬帥舉步之一剎那間，攝影記者羣紛紛滲入舞池，爭取鏡頭。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日專電〕蔣主席於政治協商會議開幕時之演詞，在今日華盛頓之午報中，佔重要地位。華府人民對於政府與中共停止軍事衝突辦法，與昨日蔣主席所決定實施之四項，均有極良好之印象。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕國會及其他政府方面人士，對於中國停止衝突之消息表示歡迎，同時認爲一切政黨取得合法地位一點，表示多年分裂之中國，已向統一大道邁步前進。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十日電〕此間接獲重慶延安間停止衝突之消息後，今日倫敦設券交易所之中國政府債券，突告劇漲，庚子債券及鐵道公債，亦直綫上漲。</p>

<p>〔本報蚌埠十一日急電〕白副總長與停戰協議之消息同時到蚌，市民歡慰，現皖東北雖有疏落之槍聲，但國軍已在皖境停止還擊。皖人士公認，皖境國軍已率先停戰，國民黨已取信於民，先得民心矣。</p>

<h3>美宣布定十六日開始　運新六軍赴東北　瀋陽等五城市我即可接收</h3>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕美軍總部昨日宣布：美軍船隻運輸新六軍由上海到東北之工作，將於本月十六日開始。新六軍禦寒配備，已整籌就緒，並已注射防疫針。至於軍運之詳細辦法，我政府與美軍當局亦已商洽妥當。</p>
<p>〔合眾社重慶十一日電〕據中央社稱：杜聿明將軍定十五日接收東北五城市，即瀋陽·撫順·遼陽·本溪及鞍山，撫順為瀋陽以東三十四哩之產煤地，遼陽為瀋陽西南四十哩之鐵路車站，本溪爲瀋陽東南三十七哩之產煤地，鞍山爲瀋陽西南五十哩之鋼鐵產地。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十日電〕我軍定十一日午由新民向前推進，十五日可入瀋陽。　〔合眾社天津十一日電〕此間今日接獲營口方面報告稱：二日前開入營口之國軍，昨遭共軍猛烈抵抗，結果死傷一百餘人。抵抗之共軍究有若干，中國方面未予披露。又據另一報告稱：蘇軍正以大量軍械向大連搬運，滿載機器及戰利品之多數鐵路車輛，正由瀋陽向北開行。杜聿明將軍之軍隊，希望於本月十五日進駐該處，但關於蘇聯允許國軍於十五日接收瀋陽之協定，迄未接獲瀋陽方面之續報。杜將軍之軍隊，大部份已自錦州司令部向北推進，在相近瀋陽之新民地方候命開拔。據報，一部分軍隊已開入瀋腸。</p>
<p>長春尚未接防熱境國軍挺進</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕東北保安總隊雖已空運長春，但目前該處防務仍由蘇軍負責，保安隊現靜居營房中，尙未實行接防。記者自可靠方面獲悉，長春迄今仍爲共產軍包圍中之籠城，轉入長春地下工作之共產軍為數約千人，長春附近二十里內有萬人，長春二十至四十里外圍二萬人，吉林，長春一帶共軍，已劃為吉長軍區，司令黃珩陽，下轄三支隊，第一支隊司令張慶和，為前長春公安總局局長，負責包圍長春。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕杜聿明將軍所部，正以如入無人之境之速度，向承德挺進中。據昨日最後之情報，國軍已西進至距葉柏壽六里之地區，若共產軍仍如過去之一擊即潰，則劉多荃主席之進入承德，費時僅需一週左右，刻熱省府人員已推進至阜新，劉主席以國軍推進迅速，政治工作亟待展開，已電留平熱省府人員火速赴錦州，向熱河進發。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十日電〕第五批空運部隊，十日午乘十機抵長。又我保安隊一連，九日由長抵哈爾濱。</p>
<h3>安東接受尚無消息　大連市長即可赴任　莫德惠向哈市府人員訓話</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕東北局勢，在微妙中向前發展。緊隨着蔣經國以蔣主席私人代表資格赴蘇，此間又傳蔣夫人將以主席夫人身份，蒞臨東北神經中樞的長春，這消息並非空穴來風，比起三十一年的迪化之行，蔣夫人此行似乎更具有重大意義。他一方象徵着中蘇的友好趨向，另方表示蔣主席對東北地方的關懷，此時放眼東北，正是風雪無邊，蔣夫人此去，該會給東北中·蘇之間及中央·地方中間帶去無量的融洽和溫暖。報紙上也有宋院長即去東北視察的消息，這似屬言之過早。海軍上將沈鴻烈悄悄的飛來，又默默向東北飛去，這位曾經帶着許多書箱去與第一次中蘇訂約談判，而第二次缺席的老將軍，在東北局勢備極微妙複雜中，今日又再度出馬，據說他將幫同張嘉璈來處理一些政治。經濟問題。截至本日，似乎蔣經國還在返國途中，此行收獲如何，熊主任也說他不知道。關於安東還沒有什麼消息，毗連朝鮮面臨鴨綠江的這一個走廊地帶，除非國際間獲有充分諒解，國內政治協商會議獲有圓滿的結果，將成爲東北的炸藥之庫。大連方面據說接收人員可以去了，將來安東主席高惜冰，大連市長沈怡，恐怕都要乘火車前往上任。</p>
<p>〔中央社哈爾濱十日電〕莫德惠及松嫩兩省主席接收委員等，九日下午二時專車抵哈，蘇城防司令喀扎科夫，長鐵局長秋夫遼夫，副局長王竹亭，市長楊綽庵及各機關首長，各界代表等均到站歡迎。十日上午十時，莫德惠赴市府向全體職員訓話，下午二時訪蘇城防司令，三時向警察訓話。</p>
<h3>東北流通券　與法幣比價　非正式一對十三</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十一日電〕東北九省流通券與法幣之匯率，現雖未經正式規定，然此間金融市塲之非正式價格，則在一比十三左右。此間各銀行今已開始依此比價收兌法幣，且可依此種比價承辦關內外之小額匯兌，惟此項匯兌尙未開始，是項比價，以由關內外之物價及交通情况自然形成，將來關內外交通恢復，物價穩定之後，隨時均有上下之可能。</p>
<h3>張羣報吿商談經過　共產軍如不整編　停止衝突並非眞正完成</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十一日電〕政治協商會議第二日，張會員羣在會議席上報告停止軍事衝突及恢復交通商談經過如次：今天主席指定本席報告停止軍事衝突及恢復交通商談經過，軍事上因何發生衝突，交通上因何發生阻礙，不是本席今天所報告的範圍。</p>
<p>關於商談經過，可以分爲兩個時期來說：第一，政府代表與中共代表商談時期，自去年十月二日政府代表向中共代表提出避免衝突恢復交通辦法後，經幾個星期的商談，又經幾個星期的停頓，至去年十二月廿七日，中共方而提出三項辦法，主張無條件停止衝突後，再討論一切。三十一日，政府方面提出具體方案，說明停止國內軍事衝突，原爲政府一貫主張，爲達此目的，必須彼此在辦法上有切實之商定，否則停止衝突之商定難期有效的實施。因此，政府提出三項辦法：（一）停止國內各地一切軍事衝突，並恢復鐵路交通。（二）因國內軍事衝突及交通阻塞等事，與我國對盟邦所負有之受降及遣送敵俘等義務有關，所有與停止軍事衝突恢復鐵路交通，及其他與受降有關事項，由政府派代表一人，中共派代表一人，會同馬歇爾將軍，從速商定辦法，提請政府實施。（三）由參政會駐會委會，推定公正人士五人，組織軍事考察團，分赴各發生衝突區域，考察軍事狀况，交通情形，以及其他與國內和平恢復有關事項，隨時將事實眞相，提出報告公布。政治協商會議成立時，亦請推定公正人士參加。</p>
<p>這個辦法，與過去所提辦法比較，有一個特點，就是把美軍在中國協助中國戰區辦理受降，及遣送敵俘的問題，與停止軍事衝突恢復交通，並作一事，作總的解決。因爲衝突不停止，交通不恢復，受降及遣送敵俘的問題，無法去辦。共他的躭延與損失，更是無法估計。中共代表對於這辦法，大體同意。又經過兩次商談，在本月五日，獲得一致的協議，作如下之決定。停止衝突及恢復交通辦法：（一）停止國內各地一切軍事衝突，並恢復一切交通。關於停止衝突及恢復交通之命令，依第二條之規定商定之。（二）因國內軍事衝突，及交通阻塞等事，與我國對盟邦所負有之受降及遣送敵俘等義務有關，故應山政府與中共各派代表一人，會同馬歇爾將軍，從速商定辦法，提請政府實施。（三）由參政會駐會委會，及政治協商會議，各推定國共兩黨當事人以外之公正人士八人，組織軍事考察團，會同國共雙方代表，分赴全國發生衝突區域，放察軍事狀况，交通情形，以及其他與國內和平恢復有關事項，隨時將事實眞相提出報告並公布之。以上說的是政府代表與中共代表商談的時期。</p>
<p>第二，政府代表中共代表與馬歇爾將軍會商時期，這個商談稱爲三人會議。自本月七日起，至昨天本會議開會之前止，共開會議六次。文件的要點。這個聲明，不僅是本會議各位先生關心，全國同胞關心，就是國際間的友邦也沒有不關心的。各位先生對於上項紀載，必然都已閱過，無待今天本席多說。政府方面，昨日業已發佈命令，並照與中共代表所商定的時限規定，在本月十三日晚十二時以前，不分何地，一律實行。自然是以五日政府代表與中共代表所同意的辦法為根據，這個會議的成就，可於昨日上午本席與中共代表周恩來先生會同發表之聲明中見其要點。一共簽定了四個文件：（一）停止衝突命令草稿，（二）了解事項，（以上兩件係三人共同簽字的）（三）軍事調處執行部，（四）共同聲明（這兩件是政府與中共雙方代表簽字的）。</p>
<p>共同聲明的內容，包括：（一）（二）（三）三個</p>
<p>關於設置軍事調處執行部事，公告中只載其要點，現在補充說明幾點如下：（一）軍事調處執行部，是爲了停止衝突，恢復交通的實施，和解除敵軍武裝，及遣送敵俘的任務順利完成而設。牠的任務，規定的很明白。（二）軍事調處執行部，設委員三人，美國方面已指定羅柏森代辦，政府方面指定軍令部鄭廳畏介民，中共方而指定葉參謀長劍英。後天就可以前往北平，開始工作。（三）軍事調處執行部的辦事程序，三個委員备有一表決權，一切事宜須經三人一致通過。以國民政府主席名義，對下發布必要的命令，對上報告由所屬的執行組，每日繕具由各委員分送其首長。（四）軍事調處執行部之工作，由執行組推動之。執行組主任，由美國軍官擔任督察有關部隊，有發布及宣達一切命令指令之權。必要地點，並得設置分站，或派遣監察或報告小組。（五）軍事調處執行部，繼續存在執行其工作，至政府或中共方面通知廢止之日為止。</p>
<p>以上各點，是公告中未提及的。為國讓各位明瞭全貌起見，特別補充報告，在三人會議之中，彼此都有互諒互讓的精神，順利進行一切商談。政府方面正提出以下三項不受停止衝突辦法的限制，須作爲例外的：第一項是關於整軍的第二項是關於接收東北各省的，第三項是關於接收赤峯多倫的問題。關於前兩項均商得一致的同意，第三項因中共代表堅決反對，所以在九日午後會議，未能獲得最後的決定。政府殷切期待此次會議的成功，在政治協商會議以前，能够宣佈停止衝突的命令，遂作最後的讓步，將此項提議併入熱察問題，作整個的解決。在此次成立停止衝突協議的時候，不作爲例外。當九日開會未得結果時，外間揣測政府有何新的提議，以致發生波折，即因此故。為三人會議通過全部議案以後，本席曾經建議，依據政府代表與中共代表前經明定之三人小組，應即成立，進行中共軍隊的整編。因為雙方軍事衝突是一件不幸的事，現在三人會議中商得停止辦法，化戾氣為祥和，自屬佳事，但停止衝突還未將問題眞正解決。停止衝突命令發表之後，就能迅速成立三人小組，關於中共部隊之整編，及其駐地之規定，從新商定具體實施辦法，付諸實施，那才算是問題眞正的解次。渙一句話來說明，就是說，現在所定執行停止衝突侖令的機構及辦法，不再存在，那才算是眞正完成我們停止衝突的使命。當時馬歇爾將軍表示認爲重要，願以三人會議之一切工作迫切的建議三人小組應從速進行。中共代表周恩來先生，仍無異議。今天本席報告，想就以此爲結論，因爲停止衝突的命令，有效的實施期間，中共部隊整編及駐地問題，如不迅商解次，無論復員整軍善後，以及政治經濟的建設，均不能順利進行，即各方人民的負擔與痛苦，也無法解除。各位先生對於此間題，極爲關懷，應當詳細報告，但一切情形及有關文件，多已發表，今天限於時間，所以止能扼要提出報告，尙請各位先生原諒。</p>

<h3>聯合國大會第二日　各委會人選決定　美蘇英中法均當選大會副主席　安全理事會非常任理事亦商定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十一日電〕聯合國大會今日爲第二日據可靠消息：內部權力分配業決定，美蘇英中法五國各獲大會副主席一席，其餘副主席兩席，則內定推舉印度及委內瑞拉擔任。各委員會主席亦已內定如下：政治安全委員會主席屬烏克蘭，經濟委員會主席屬渡蘭，社會福利委員會主席屬紐西蘭，託管委員會主席屬烏拉圭，行政委員會主席屬叙利亞，法理委員會主席屬巴拿馬。安全理事會權力最大，將來之國際警察即由其指揮，理事十一人，除美蘇英中法五國為當然理事外，其餘六席大約須至明日始能決定。英自治領可得理事一席，加拿大與澳洲逐鹿甚烈。尚餘五席大約將屬哥倫比亞及墨西哥，作爲南美及中美代表，比利時代表西歡，波蘭代表東默，埃及代表中東。大會秘書長人選，聞五大國將於今夜開會予以決定。美英贊成以加拿大駐美大使庇亞遜承乏，蘇聯則贊成南斯拉夫駐美大使薛米克，大約須俟蘇聯首席代表維辛斯基到達後，方能作最後決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕聯合國大會會長史巴克今晨要求大會設一臨時委員會，以調查古巴提出之修正議案，並決定該議案之採納與否。該議案主張設一委員會，委員五十一人，由全體代表團各派一人，其工作則有嚴格限制。眾認此議案之目的，乃圖避免設立一般性之小委員會，其委員僅十四人，而或可作重要之政治決議，史巴克於致開會詞後，復要求大會准許執行秘書及共隨員，從事大會秘書長及秘書之工作，至正式派定秘書長為止，此動議並無反對者，遂護通過，此外，又請哥倫比亞代表提出籌備委員會之報告書。</p>
<p>史巴克開會詞　謂必促進各國利益　始能消除各方異見</p>
<p>〔路透社倫教十一日電〕聯合國大會今日舉行第二日會議，開會時，史巴克起立致詞，對被舉爲大會會長之殊榮，表示感謝。史氏操法語，語調鏗鏘有力，歷十二分鐘始畢。全塲歡聲雷動，史氏演詞要旨曰：聯合國機構之偉大任務，欲獲成功，則國際精神，實屬必要，史氏演詞首謂：渠今當選固感滿足，然亦有扼腕之意。因其友人雷依，即代表挪威英勇人民之挪威外長，未獲當選也。推雷依爲會長候選人之抉擇，渠完全明瞭其意義。且渠對能依投贊成票之各代表，抱同樣之感覺，史氏繼以會長資格，歡迎全體代表，而特別對羅斯福夫人，推頌備至。謂此乃最榮耀與最受尊敬之姓名。偉大人物羅斯福總統之棄世，萬人同聲悲悼。全塲聞言，一致歡呼。史氏續稱：「昨日就雷依及挪威英勇人民所發言論，余均有同感，余承諸位投票推舉，深爲感荷，抑余尙願說明，投票推舉雷依之諸君，乃欲頌揚彼本人及其國家，余殊瞭解此意。余今環顧四週，見有許多代表，致力於和平，實遠勝於余，自較余更有受此榮譽之資格，實令余惶愧不已。」至此，史氏願對會議開始略致數言，曰：世界上曾有此種試騐，今非初次，然初次試騐，不幸未獲成功。此或不待贅述者，然前車之鑒，終可敞來茲，兩次大戰間之時期中，吾人未能形成國際精神，抑吾人欲求工作成功，國際精神，固所必要，在一如聯合國機構之會議中，必須大事努力，方能消除異見，吾人之任務，乃在促進各國之利益，然此利益必予擴大爲一般的利益，吾人方可獲得成功云。</p>
<p>選舉會長之時　橢圓體臨時推挪威外長　結果仍比外長當選</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕五十一國代表於昨日下午四時（上海時間午夜十二時）開始協力工作，以建立「以公理人道主義建立之安全而自由的世界」。籌備委員會主席哥倫比亞國代表楚萊泰博士，於第一次國際聯盟成立後之二十五週年紀念日，在擁擠之倫敦中央應中，徐徐自紫紅色之座精起立，揭開第二次建立持久和平大會之序幕。此次主持大會開幕之特權，竟由南美一小共和國之代表取得，由此亦可見聯合國機構之全體會員，均享有主權之平等。時會塲肅靜無聲，各代表均正襟危坐，旋英相阿特里起立，致謝此一臨時主席，並歡迎來自世界各地之各國政治家。阿特里首相亦以前在日內瓦所宣布之格言：「和平乃不可分者」贈與此次大會。（阿特里演詞全文，見本版右角關欄。）昨日最緊張之局面，在阿特里首相演說以後，選舉會長之時。會前預料全塲可一致推選比利時外長史已克爲會長，而蘇聯代表葛洛米哥臨時忽動議選挪威外長黎埃爲會長。烏克蘭·丹麥·波蘭代表團亦予附議。關於選舉方式，十五代表團贊成秘密九個代表團贊成公開而棄權者，則有二十七個代表團。良以此事殊出意料之外。令人不知何所決定。故築權者如是之多。結果決定秘密投票，唱票時宣布以二十八票對二十三票，史巴克當選爲會長。歡呼之聲立起，史巴克乃登主席台，向全體代表及臨時主席楚萊泰致謝，並宣布將於今日發表正式就職演說。同時正式宣布聯合國機構全體大會首次會議之召開。</p>
<h3>對聯合國機構　我代表態度　係建設性的而非批判的　凡有助該機構我可退讓</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十日電〕中國某高級官員今日告合衆社，稱：「中國與國際機構合作，尙屬初次　試。如對新機構之工作有所助益，中國願在某數方面稍事退讓。渠指出中國對聯合國機構之態度，係「建設性的而非批判的」，該官員稱：中國對推選聯合國機構之執行機關，並無特殊意見，但渠希望中國能參與其間。當詢其對託管制度之意見時，渠即曰：此項制度須有一時限，其後此等國家即應交還各該國人民。</p>
<h3>安全會託管會　埃及佔一席地</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十日電〕聯合國大會五十一國代表於進行會議時，將推舉埃及爲聯合國機構安全理事會及託管理事會會員，此事似已確定。聯合社從可靠方面探悉：埃及可獲得廣大援助，與中美蘇英法五强及其他五國同列席於安全理事會。該會之直接工作，爲考慮一切可能方法，於世界任何地點發生重大危機時防止破壤和平。據埃及代表稱：安全理事會會員將根據地理分配，埃及可參加安全理事會具有兩大理由：第一，埃及與英國等享有條約關係，且當英國交通綫要衝，似爲一天然適宜之會員。第二，埃及已被認爲阿刺伯國家之領袖，因此可得阿刺伯聯盟各國擁護，阿刺伯聯盟各國中包括伊拉克，黎巴嫩與阿刺伯，均爲聯合國大會會員。伊索比亞與阿刺伯國家間有天然之同情，故觀察者皆信伊索比亞亦將贊助埃及。且埃及在籌備委員會辯論中爲一重要角色，中東在世界各國關係中，又爲一敏感部份，因此，阿刺伯各國在決定未來政策之理事會中，決心欲具有發言權。英國提議以解決中東問題之責任，交與聯合國機構。消息靈通方面認此爲增强阿刺伯國家代表權之又一論據。伊朋對蘇關係問題，近東與法國間之問題，埃及對英國要求修改一九三六年條約及對於蘇丹有較大管理權問題，皆足令阿拉伯國家謀得較强之發言權。英國已決將其問題移交聯合國機構，因此阿刺伯國家認爲必須在託管理事會中獲得代表權。</p>
<h3>蘇稱譽聯合國會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十日電〕莫斯科電台廣播稱：「聯合國第一屆全體大會在三强外長重申三大國合作後開幕，條件至爲良好。大會對奠定公正持久和平，應作具體之貢獻。」</p>
<h3>印度首席代表　關切託管委會</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十日電〕印度出席聯合國大會首席代表勒瑪薩佛米爵士今日告記者稱。「印度代表團對託管委員會極爲關切，蓋日後受委任統治各國特別如印度東南區域之前途，於吾人有切身利害關係。託管理事會之成立，尙需若干時日，非俟大會邀請前在國聯擁有委任統治地各國與直接有關各邦訂立諧和一致之協定，似不能成立。此種協定，曾首由託管委員會審查，然後提付大曾。」記者詢以是否印度應在託管委員會中佔有席次，爵士稱：「印度參加乃必須之事。」爵士在籌備大會及舊金山會議中曾任社會經濟委員會主席。記者探詢是否在大會中有續任該委員會主席可能，爵士不予討論，但相信該委員會工作須三年可以完成云。又悉安全委員會及其他委員會，須在每屆會期更換主席，惟社會經濟委員會主席任期一年，今夏召集國際貿易會議爲其任務之一。</p>
<h3>阿特里演詞全文</h3>
<p>〔英團新聞處倫敦十一日電〕聯合國大會色於十日在倫敦之威斯敷斯特之中央樓開幕，英開首相阿特里昨晚（上海時間，昨晨一時半）致開會調，全文如下：</p>
<p>予得在此歡迎聯合國代表光臨倫敦，實屬不勝榮幸。予首先得申謝生席先生之致詞，其爲聯合國籌備委員會主席，身當艱巨使命，而有今日之成功，吾人無不深深感佩。予從同僚處得悉籌備會幸有先生之指導，非先生之幹才，責任心與施予同僚之引導，今日恐尙不能有議　　　，以供大會討論。</p>
<p>予潔望此次大會能有籌備會之緊張，脚踏實地，與合作之精神。籌備會中諸大問題，雖曾經坦白熱烈之辯論，然協調精神與善意，亦同時存在，故結果能趨一致。</p>
<p>吾人旣歡迎諸君光臨倫敦，自必盡力使諸君在吾人之首都，不覺生疏而發表自由坦白之言論，彷彿諸君正匯集於國際共管之特殊領土之上。吾人必將在可能範園內，使諸君留英期間，感到愉快舒適。遇有招待不週之處，願諸君能體諒此古城，因受敵人之蹂躪，而有匱乏，決非吾人之不盡心意，諸君四圍所見，即可爲其明證。</p>
<p>昨晚英皇陛下代表不列顛聯邦共和國於其　短而動人之演詞中，曾提及吾人必須成就之事功，究屬何種性質。目前時局之嚴重性，以及英聯邦共和國中各　如何熱國聯合馴纖構初次大會之成功。</p>
<p>聯合國憲章乃自瀾金山會劉所產生，該會予亦參加，會議發動時，敵人尚在戰爭狀態中，會議象徵勝利之信心與爭議戰之重申·憲章之序文與第一條中所戰會議之目的與原則，為英皇陛下之政府悉心擁護，亦本國人民不分黨派听一致信任者。</p>
<p>在予之一生中，戰爭已二次賜人不可描幕之悲哀，如有第三次戰爭發生。文化之進步，必將停頓，人類千百年來之心血，亦將毀滅殆盡。聯合國憲章之序文表彰崇高理想，戰爭中亦已有無數男女為之捨身，原則之盯定本不難，理想成爲事實，則殊非簡易。</p>
<p>人民凡受戰爭激動時，易於實現理想。一九二〇年夏，本國面臨被侵略危機，全國人民以　一目標奮起，且立即採取行動，男女無不踴躍參加工作，適　需要。該目標經五年戰爭，始終如一·五年中各國相繼參戰，各國後方工人團合作，同為勝利之目標努力，於協力同心之奮鬥過程中，各國一已之企圖，遂無形消失。</p>
<p>今日吾人之武器已戴上勝利之冠冕，吾人之任務，在迅速建立永久和平，患難與戰爭中各國從公背私之犧牲精神，今日仍屬必要，吾人必須充分認識所負使命之緊要性，而一致完成任務。</p>
<p>今後決定世間外交政策時，應數最先考慮聯合　機構。第一次大戰後，普通外交政策恒以　爲前題，而忽觀臘際聯盟。昔日英國貴族擁有武裝侍從，日久漸受公家管制，而私人軍隊終於消滅，同一原理，世上之武裝軍數，應一律受鉗制。吾人必須認淸蘇聯外長於日內瓦所宣佈和平之不可分性。遠東日本發動侵略與意大利法西斯之侵略行動，因未予適當處理，而有撕毁法律之後果。納粹五年侵略會將全球捲入戰爭旋渦，今日吾人之幸福，更較以往互相關聯。聯合國憲章內容，包括個人簡單之基本要求，並認識一國內之個人自由，乃聯合國中列國自由之附屬物。</p>
<p>予曾言明建立和平，防止戰爭，乃空前之迫切任務，吾國以往頗海洋作屏障，因得安居，今日更易領悟目前已臨新時代。强烈之武器及遠距離所施毁壞，已消滅吾人僻居安域之錯覺。吾人所受警告已不少，原彈的出現，可謂最末一次警告。加破壤力不受控制，人類最高文化將遭全部毀滅之厄運。</p>
<p>因此，予決定以原子能控制問題之全部，委諸聯合國機構。此乃當前世界面臨之大問題，各國人民之將由代表，務必作生死之選擇。　予深望並深信今日在座各代表，此次來英，不僅具有決心，且胸懷希望，懷疑與消極之輩必永遠有戰爭，國際聯盟如是失敗，安能有望於聯合國機構？」殊不知文化進程，乃失敗與經馳學習之連環。工聯運動即一本失敗史，每失敗一次，懷疑派稱：「工人之倔人興趣過强，自不能團結。」結果工人竟告團結。</p>
<p>予對於聯合國機構之成功，具有堅固之信心，吾人自以往錯誤中已學得不少，舊國際聯盟之所以失敗，在於無能，主因在於其形成時期中，美蘇政府未能參加。</p>
<p>今日世界各國空前團結，且新機構之章程中，規定以武力保障其法律。</p>
<p>予認爲世界各國之庶民，必亦認識今日世界之危機，欲使聯合國機構成為活生生之現實而非理想，吾人不僅宜獲得各團政府之用戶，且應受全世界人民之支持。</p>
<p>吾人目標欲達到無恐　，不感貧乏之地步，經濟上無保障，較戰爭之恐怖為更恒久，無社會保障即無和平之基礎可言。是故會議中之經濟與安全工作，應具有國際力量。此外國際警察亦屬必要，然世界人民愈感安全滿足，警察之需要即愈少。</p>
<p>對於個別人民，經濟上之無保障，較戰爭之陰影為恒久而顯著·人人當能領會此次會議中討論之一切，有關人人，且將影響人人之家庭與生活。</p>
<p>最後吾人不妨檢討和平，究竟何謂。和平即無戰爭，即安全與自由世界之建立。而此世界受正義與道德法律之統治，以權制力，以公益克制私慾。吾人今日能於此自由法律之老家聚首，全由勇敢之男女受苦或死亡，吾人乃得生存，吾人必須永誌此番偉大犧性，並以勇敢忍耐及犧性精神，繼承先烈之事功，吾人必須成功，亦必然可獲成功也。</p>
<h3>日內閣決定改組　討論終日結果並不總辭職　辭職閣員姓名人數未發表</h3>

<h3>艾帥命令所屬　遣送士兵返國</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十日電〕據代理陸軍部長羅耶昨日宣佈：艾森豪威爾元帥業已訓令海外部隊司令，不按計分標準，而儘速遣送並無軍事上需要之國外駐兵返國，羅耶並稱：陸軍部正檢討全部復員情况，不久即將訂立詳細計劃。據接獲之報告稱：「若千戰區中頗有甚多之士兵，僅因不合陸軍部所定之退伍計分標準而不能遣送回團，陸軍部不久即將擬定新計劃。當此時期，君等已被賦予特權，君等應繼續遣送一切並無軍事上要求之人員返回美國，並仍按最高分數與最長服役時期爲先被遣送之標準」</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕德國弗朗克福所駐美軍亦舉行示威運動，要求回國，並向美軍司令麥克耶尼將軍發出噓噓之聲。美國陸軍參謀長艾森豪華將軍，現因公赴加拿大，須至下星期初始能返華盛頓，或當於下星期二出席參衆兩院聯席會議，討論美軍復員延遲情形及修正復員程序。</p>

<h3>歐洲組聯邦國家　杜魯門曾加考慮　但認為不必與美國相同</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約九日電〕美國政論家柯雷爾近在「考里爾」雜誌著論稱：杜魯門總統曾考慮歐　洲各國是否可組成一聯邦國家。認爲此一聯邦乃安定和平及繁榮所寄。總統之意，並非欲歐洲聯邦組織必完全與美國相同，惟須使用同一貨幣，締結關稅同盟，共同開發天然資源，及使用航路。總統所以考慮洲組織聯邦，實欲解決以下兩大問題：（一）美國政府如何可以有效方法協助歐洲復興，直至歐洲能將外界所予之援助，善爲運用時爲至。（二）歐洲有關稅及貿易限制，且幣制混亂傳交易無法進行，並使都市工業區與鄉村隔絕。在此情况之下，歐洲有何眞正復興希望。例如挪威需要義大利所產之鹽，義大利亦需要挪威所產之魚。德國礦區產媒甚多而丹麥，匈牙利及荷蘭則富於糧食，且可以糧食換取德國之煤。惟因目前貿易壁壘重重疊疊，使彼此物資無從交換。歐洲各國消除其恐懼及仇恨之心，彼此視如家人，則將來必各大事擴張軍備。各國如不停止將各項資源用於建設軍備，民衆生活程度勢將無法提高。總統相信倘美國國內亦不幸而採取歐洲各國現在政策或如歐洲之四分五裂，則美國必將陷於混亂。已故法政治家白里安及前英首相邱吉爾均曾主張歐洲應　為一體，反對此項計劃者，惟軍火商及抱國家主義之政客而已。瑞士可視爲「歐洲聯邦之縮影」，其所有二十二郡已結合而爲一個聯邦國家。美國人士所主張建立之歐洲聯邦，其中將不包括英國及蘇聯在內，因如將蘇聯包括在內，無異將歐洲範圍擴大至太平洋區域。蘇聯勢力將歐洲聯邦失去平衡。歐洲聯邦組成後，可有數大利益，因在此制度之下，各國將無帝國主義野心，蘇聯可從此不必顧慮「西方集團」之出現，而致其全力於開發本國資源。英國可乘機集中注意力，解決本國問題，而美國國內亦可產生一種信念，即現所用於歐洲之金錢將爲歐洲建立穩固基礎。</p>
<h3>蘇外次抵保國　商討保內閣改組</h3>

<h3>聯合國全體大會　會塲花絮</h3>

<p>〔聯合社東京十一日電〕美國陸軍部畏柏德遜在此視察事畢，啓程前往中國及菲律濱。今日於臨行前招待日本新聞記者稱：日皇裕仁所負之戰爭責任，勿需退位，此事應由日本人民自行決定。關於日本皇室之全部問題，波茨坦協定已予規定。柏氏對麥帥及佔領軍，備極讚美。並稱：太平洋美軍至五月間，可滅至四十萬人。關於蘇聯或中國請派佔領軍至日本之說，彼並無所聞。柏氏不承認復員計劃在實行上有何不妥。陸軍部對於循序復員曾經審愼規劃。其復員人數亦較去年八九月間所估計者大爲加速云。</p>

<h3>政治協商會議　出席會員談話記　孫院長科　闡明政府主張</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十日電〕中央社記者十日下午訪講政治協商會議出席會負，孫院長科，承發表談話如下：</p>
<p>記者問：今晨政治協商會議開會，吾人聆聽蔣主席開會致詞，暨政府自動宣佈關於人民自由，政黨合法地位，普遍及政治犯四個問題的辦法以後，至感興奮，但未能列席會議人士，對於此次會議中政府方面的主張，因報章尙無披露，未盡明瞭，可否請院長就此點有所發表？</p>
<p>孫院長答：蔣主席此次召開政治協商會議，其目的在徽詢各黨各派及在野賢達意見，以爲解次目前國內和平建國，民主統一的問題，政府方面將就現行法統之下，擴大政府之基礎，使大家得以共同參加憲政開始前過渡期間政府議構，共負政治責任。</p>
<p>問：各黨各派，社會賢達，將如何參加此過渡期間之政府機構？</p>
<p>答：政府擬從修改國民政府組織法着手，擴充國民政府委員會，以爲政治最高次策指導機關，其具體辦法爲：（一）擴充國民政府委員名額，（二）國民政府委員得由國民政府主席提請選任黨外人士充任之。</p>
<p>問：國民政府委員會如此擴大改組之後，其職權有何新規定？</p>
<p>答：擴大改組後之國民政府委員會，其職權與現在國防最高委員會相同，亦即從前中央政治會議所行使的職權，國民政府委員會開會時，其所討論次議的事項，包括左列六類，〔甲〕立法原則，〔乙〕施政方針，〔丙〕軍政大計，〔丁〕財政計畫及預算，〔戊〕主席交議事項，〔巴〕委員三分之一以上連署提出之建議事項。</p>
<p>問：國民政府委員會對上列事項次議後，是否馬上見諸實行　答：是項次議，當予以執行，但國民政府主席對國民政府委員會之次議，如認為執行困難，得提交援議，如三分之二以上委員，主張維持原案，該項次議，即應予執行。</p>
<p>問：根據此項規定，國家大小事情，是否都須經國民政府委員會討論次議，才能處理？</p>
<p>答：如國內遇有重大事變，或外患緊急情形，不能等待國民政府委員會決定處理應付者，兩氏政府主席得爲權宜之處置後，出主席報告國民政府委員會，擴大改組後，國民政府委員會，爲國家系統內最高的政治機關，前在南京有一個時期，國民政府委員會會議，即政府之最高機關。</p>
<p>問：國民政府擴大改組後，行政院組織，將有相當更動否？</p>
<p>答：政府主張行政院設置政務委員若干人，得兼各部會長官</p>
<p>問：五五憲草，是否將在此兩週內政治協商會議中予以修改</p>
<p>答：政府主張推定專家，組織委員會，參酌各方面所提意見，彙總整理，提交國民大會採納，但關於五五憲草原則方面，當可由政治協商會議討論。</p>
<p>問：政府明令宣佈今年五月五日召開國民大會，會期有無變更？</p>
<p>答：本年五月五日召開國民大會爲制憲的國民大會，政府原定二十六年召開，後因抗戰爆發，政府西遷，不得已展期，因此政府主張制憲的國民大會，不宜再行展期。</p>
<p>問：關於國民大會代表，外間有主張重選者，政府意見如何</p>
<p>答：當選的代表，原以根據政府所頒佈的國民大會組織法選舉法。此項法規，僅規定代表在務，爲制定憲法及決定憲法施行日期，此外並無任期之規定。蓋此第一屆國民大會非根據憲法規定之國民大會，只有任務而無任期。故政府不能贊同原選代表無效，及全部重選之說。如全部改選，不免增加糾紛。同時，不能趕及五月五日開會之時限。政府意見，除已選出者外，其餘名額將予以合理增加。使各黨派及社會人士，有充份參加機會。此第一屆國民大會，任務完成散會後，第二屆國民大會，將於六個月內，依照憲法辦理全國總選舉組織成立。記者談至此，因孫院長另有他事，即興辭而出。</p>
<p>基於共同綱領舉國一致合作</p>
<p>周恩來</p>
<p>出席政治協商會議會員周恩來氏，十日於會議開幕時致詞：這樣的政治協商會議，在中國的政治歷史上，還是創舉。尤其舉國一致要求迅速結束訓政，積極籌備憲政的過渡期中，這個會議更負有嚴重的歷史任務。我們中共代表團，本此認識，願以極大的誠意和容忍，與各黨代表及社會賢達，共商國是，努力合作。</p>
<p>此次代表團前來陪都，首先提出無條件停止內戰，經廿多天的呼籲和奔走，經政府代表的共同努力，尤其是經我們盟邦馬歇爾將軍的贊助，最後賴　蔣主席的遠見和次心，使全世界全中國所關心的內戰，在今天雙方下令停止了。</p>
<p>軍事衝突停止了，才能很好的談到政治解次，政治解次就是要實現和平建國的方針，國共雙方在雙十會談紀要中，已經承認在和平民主團結統一的基礎上，幷在蔣主席領導之下，長期合作，堅次避免內戰，建設獨立自由和富强的新中國，澈底實現三民主義。雙方又同認政治民主化，軍隊國　化，及黨派平等合法，爲達到和平建國必由之途徑。政治協商會議就要請各黨代表及社會賢達，一致起來訂出如何實現政治民主化軍隊國家化及黨派平等合法的方案，幷在此過渡期中，我們提議要在共同綱領的基礎之上，實現各黨派無黨派代表人士合作的舉國一致的政府，於此人民權利和黨派合作，更是目前急迫待次的問題，方才聽到　蔣主席關於保證人民權利四項的公佈，我們表示歡迎這個公佈，並願爲實現這條權利而奮鬥。。有了和平團結的局面，有了民主統一的基礎，中國才能進行眞正的人民普選，和民主憲政，也才能有眞正的農業改革和工業建設。預祝政治協商會議的成功。</p>
<p>當前緊急任務完成復員救濟</p>
<p>沈鈞儒</p>
<p>政治協商會議沈會員鈞儒於十日最開幕時致詞：今天政治協商會議開幕，這不止是全國人民注意的一件事，也是全世界人士注意的一件事，我首先代表中國民主同盟全體出席會員，向會議表示眞誠坦白，至公無私的與諸位會員共同擔負這大責任。我們認為當前復員與救濟這些間題，比較制憲行憲問題，還要迫切。我們願與會員諸公，共同先來解決這些間題。我國中國民主同盟，對解決這些問題，着重這幾點：第一，不能違反人民普遍的願望。第二，不可辜負盟友協助的好意。第三，方案實行的時候必出之以至誠，守之以至信，關於解決上列問題的詳細辦法，我們願本互讓的原則，在會議中求得公平合理的結果。</p>
<p>大家開誠佈公構成建國陳綫</p>
<p>曾琦</p>
<p>今日上午政治協商會議曾會員琦致詞：今天本會議開幕，本席謹代表中國靑年黨同志，簡單說幾旬話。我們希望由此而渡到憲政階段，講成建國的統一陣綫，期以三十年，究成名實相符的近代國家。但要達到這個目的，必須朝野合作，一德一心，同舟共濟，以「合作抗戰」的精神，來合作建國。尤須彼此相見以誠，我想要把國家納入正軌，惟有實行政治民主化，與軍隊國家化，而欲達到此目的，必須大家實行「開誠佈公，集思廣益，循名核實，激濁揚淸」十六個字，謹以此貢獻於大會諸先生。幷祝本會議順利成功，完全達到民主團結，和平建國的目的。</p>
<p>願以車輪為喻促其向前邁進</p>
<p>邵從恩</p>
<p>政治協商會議邵會員從恩，十日晨會議中致詞：今天從恩承無黨無派諸位會員委託，來說幾句話。今天好了，前綫戰事停止了，雙方表示愛國心，本着這種愛國心，可使國家前途發生一種希望。我們想想過去這種歧途走不通，內而害了老百姓，外而盟邦爲我購躇，我們的敵人看到歡喜。以後大家就要「誠，」要「信。」如果內裏是一套，外面是一套，就是「不誠。」今天是一套，明天是一套、就是「不信。」其次各黨各派，要互相諒解。外國有政黨，乃至有許多政黨，其中必有一個保守性的。國家沒有保守性的政黨，國家基礎隨時會動搖。又必有一個進步性的政黨。國家沒有進步性的政黨，政治一天天要退化。這兩種政黨，看來相反，而是相成，並且相互為因。有如兩個輪子，同一方向，一天天向新的路上前進。反過來看看，中國好傑也是如此。國共兩黨有如柱石，其他各黨就是橫樑。但是我們今天柱石和橫樑，並沒有成為一個很完全的體系。從恩內本着良心，上看到國家，下看到百姓，本此三者，來賀獻意見，報效國家。（鼓掌）</p>
<p>較猢猻狡滑的山下奉文</p>
<p>山下奉文，被盟軍法庭判處紋型，實爲罪有應得。而山下猶不澈底悔禍，還在跟他的辯護律師共同研究其判決書，以冀挽回其死亡之命運。同時，不識時務的八萬六千名東京市民，竟又發勸簽名運動，求免山下之死刑，想亦枉費心機的了。舊金山紀事報作識刺性之短評曰：「口不出惡語，耳不聞惡言，目不覩惡事之三猴，將讓位於山下奉文矣！」此語入木三分，辛辣之至。圖示：山下與其辯護律師研討判決書之情狀。</p>
<h3>彭城走馬記　（下）</h3>
<p>— 邵愼之</p>
<p>徐州設市，係日本投降之新描施。第一任市長路東藩，於十二月中旬到達視事，於二十八日補行就職典禮，渠對記者稱市區之規州，江蘇省府當在研究中。徐州可能爲今後團內較有規模之普通市，惟目前財駁收入，三分之二供支全市行政公務員薪給，屬用地方建設者僅三分之一，故較之其他特別市入不敷支者固可差强人意，然其比例，則當有待納入常軌也。</p>
<p>徐州歲暮酪寒，元且飛雪。軍民衣布服，報厚而臃腫，於朔中舒徐過市。顯示其對自然之抵抗力。而貧苦老匯，則手頰俱紫，盤旋於水凍似琉璃之行人這上操作乞討，厭狀至殊可惻。此即爲北放門戶徐州之街頭景象。而街頭日人往來之繁，較之京滬尤甚。詢諸負責當局，謂日僑現僅八千餘，彼等仍能設肆經營小商。</p>
<p>一日本咖啡座之女店主謂「此乃警備部可憐我們，准我等營業者。」言及日寇在中國之罪行時，彼謂「我等實不能負責，」旋即不願續談，以避免此尖銳之現實問題。記者不解「可憐」之含議何若，不知爲寬容之代稱，抑爲放縱之別解？</p>
<p>據日俘管處負責人談：「徐州日俘，最高紀錄曾集中人數一萬七千四百零五人，刻有一萬二千四百六十人，得船　國。至日僑入千二百零六人，未曾事設管理機構，無形中亦爲管理處所負責。自汴鄭方面撤向津浦綫北上之日僑一千三百六十四人，以交通關係於臨城折回，亦由管理處送往海州登船。目前在徐日僑，大致劃定啓明路以北，　雲路以東，老黃河以南區域，准許彼等居住。」</p>
<p>此等日僑，除準備回國外，其生活方式，似稍禾變更。最近即忙於所謂引揚組織之編列。十二月廿六日，彼等之新自治會結成準備會舉行第二次大會，準備會包括委員二十人，推由徐州總領事任名譽會長，標示「官民一體」。會長一人（民），副會長二人，（官民各一），三十日投票，三十一日選出。總共選役員五十名，但其中五名至六名，則由其官方推薦。男女各二十歲以上，始有選舉權，關於彼等之引揚組織，已分成七團十四隊。</p>
<p>際此年末年始，日僑曾獲非正式命令，促彼等實行「自肅」，其注意點有二：（一）新年門首懸日章旗，忘年會，新年宴會，概行廢止；（二）不准在街頭露醉態，不准婦女華裝外出。記者於元且日果未見日僑居屋懸日章旗，亦未懸中國國旗。雖仍見有醉酒之日本流氓，於日本咖啡座中向女侍調笑之醜態，然一般日僑之表情，殊森冷陰沈，沈默疾行　檐下，且亦觧見彼等跡蹤矣。</p>
<p>元且日徐州有慶祝會，有大游行，軍樂喧揚，街頭結綏。置大Ｖ字彩燈於馬路中，高可丈許，鮮紅奪目。勝利後徐州始有舞塲，設國民會塲之側室內，寬不滿五十方公尺，吹破喇叭，奏各種舞曲，刺耳異常，舞女僅三，但舞者極踴躍。獲假之士兵則聚門外觀之，繼即破門而入，擠佇塲內不散，無言無笑，睹此「奇蹟」，幾釀衝突。此亦爲元且日之一挿曲。</p>
<p>記者以津浦綫浦徐段車運中斷，阻滯徐州五日，明日或可搭工程車至京。徐州刻正發起慰勞運動，負責籌劇者在各處訂購食品，以便空運投送臨城守軍。記者曾在新新西餐館進餐二次，其所焙麵包殊佳，詢以原因，謂正大量焙製，故無不新鮮也。惟民用燃謀向由關係方面獲自柳泉媒礦者，自有令禁止軍隊訂購，概充路用後，稍感困難耳。（卅五年元且於徐州）</p>
<h3>寄語昆明冒險家　田園將蕪胡不歸　霑益城投機活動已成尾聲</h3>
<p>本報昆明特派員　張軍</p>
<p>在冒險家的生命綫上，昆明和霑益，確曾一度成爲他們的樂園。這兩個樂園的興起，時間上雖相距數年，而後者（霑益）的作風與變化，却有靑出於藍之勢。有些人把昆明比作戰前的上海，把霑益比作美國早年的西部城市，確有幾許類似之處。大多數的冒險家，雖然在昆明霑益，失去了他們的樂園，但有一部份的人，尙在此間掙扎。至於已作還鄕客者，也許前途益無量。廣大的收復區，何處不可重建新樂園。</p>
<p>樂園盛衰史　展開兩條綫鬥爭</p>
<p>談到昆明樂園的盛衰史，不應忽視「兩條錢的鬥爭：」一條是始暢中塞的滇緬公路，一條是飛越駝峰的中印航綫，前一條綫是司機的黃金時代，後一條是掮客，投機商，及「國際路綫」的黃金時代。前者使樂園突然興起，後者使樂國達到全盛時期，兩條綫的沒落，扼住了冒險家的生路。有些曹險家無用武之地，乃向墳墓進攻，昆明市郊墳墓，常被盜掘，去年十一·十二·兩月內，盜墓案達百餘件，尤以女墓佔多數，嗚呼，死者竟不能安於土，實一慘事也。想當年，掮客滿樂園，賭塲，舞廳，酒肆，多少人揮金如土，看今日，門庭冷落，失業人數激增，冒險的悲哀，竟至表現在地攤上，不免令人啼笑皆非！</p>
<p>冒險家複雜　大小掮客佔多數</p>
<p>所謂冒險家，份子最複雜，而以掮客佔多數，昆市各掮客，多半無首領，無組織，但與行會有關，就種類言，最大的掮客，最初專營美軍各項業務，嗣後改與後勤部及運輸局接洽，小掮客則如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，終日席不暇暖，藉用金以自肥。就性質分，有一種「空心大少」，以跑街爲專業。另有一種「正派人物」，常藉各項交易的合同，取得保證金以獲利。至於憑藉職業，權勢，及社會關係，兼營或專營掮客業務者尤多。據估計：以上三種人物，在勝利以前，共約五六萬人。掮客買賣的商品，最初以汽油爲最有利，後因政府規定顏色，交易即受限制，但是一般稱有後台的冒險家，更因此而獲厚利。其次，爲酒精，營此業而致富者極多，來源多係私貨，開廠自製者甚少。有些人常靠出讓合同以營利，有些人以「跑合同」爲專業，幹這行業的人物，除須具有冒險精神外，必須有點人事的背景。第三類主要商品，是販夏槍枝，毒品，及其他違禁物，尚有代運或包運違禁物者，許多糾紛與流血事件，常發生於此種買賣或包運中。</p>
<p>擺還鄉地攤　是最高級冒險家</p>
<p>昆市正式商人及金融界人物，一般失敗與成功者，多因冒險投機而致。商業銀行中，江浙帮最穩健，故在此次勝利前後，無大損失。川帮銀行根基較差者，在勝利之初，處境極困難。本地帮各銀行，因能互相調度，難關較易渡過。一般冒險投機的鉅子，大都失敗在黃金。美鈔。紗布上。某銀行一中級職員，原有資本二千萬元，後又借貸四千萬元，收購黃金外幣，再將其抵押借款，囤積他物，勝利的鞭爆一響，負債八千萬元，結果無法價付，跑到重慶去自殺了。從前年八月到去年八月，堪稱黃金外幣狂熟年。冒險家，正式商人，半官半商，明官暗商的人物，大都集中在這條綫上。結果，均告慘敗，狼狽不堪。去年八月至十月，咸稱「救濟呼籲月」。商人工廠，通過民意機關與報紙，要求緊急救濟。某金店握有八千兩黃金儲蓄券，也在大呼不得了。而一般小市民與公務員，雖然遭受了同樣的命運，反而比較鎭靜。數年的心血，一旦付諸東流，自嘆晦氣之餘，擺一個還鄕地攤，弄點還鄕旅費，這樣的冒險家，乃其上焉者。</p>
<p>幹一筆生意　即成賭臺座上客</p>
<p>談到冒險家的樂園，還不可忽略了昆明的賭塲，大賭小階，成了家常便飯，一　數百萬元者，比比皆是。金融界有一二鉅子，其前途，即斷送在牌桌上。據記者所知：有一批中等掮客，經常聚賭抽頭，輪流作東道主，牌客一桌，每晚招待費，動輒三四十萬元，而其抽頭所得，則在百萬元左右。在去年一年內，彼等輪流抽頭的總數，約達一萬萬元，由此可見其他。在賭塲上失敗了的朋友，只要幹一批冒險或投機生意，馬上又是揮金臺前的座上客了。不過這些人，必有其背景在焉。</p>
<p>霑益城崛興　始終去年三月間</p>
<p>昆明與霑益兩地，在冒險家的活動上，堪稱兩個母子城。霑益這個小小的子城，去年三月始與起，抗戰勝利時即告沒落。該地原係西南公路與川滇東路的一小站，地位遠不及曲靖。後因川滇鐵路伸展到霑益，又因大型飛機塲的建築，突然變成了西南交通的重要樞紐。美空軍與遠征軍，大批的集中於其地，繁榮了破爛的蕭條約市面。火車站附近，在短期內建築了一個新市塲。最多者爲酒吧間，並多僱用女招待，以迎合美軍，其次為茶館，座上客常滿，成爲掮客的大本營。冒險家塵集該地，競相買賣汽油·酒精·外幣·及各項違禁品，茶樓酒肆，經常發生口角，鬥毆，兇殺等情事，或因交易糾紛，或因敲索未遂，或因分贓不勻所致。室內與街上，常聞槍聲，一夕數驚，更屬常事。出入其間的軍人，商人，流氓，地痞，大多槍不離身，藉以自衛。帮會乘機活躍，大量羅致幹部，造成了該地的特殊勢力，地方當局，亦無法約制。投機商人欲在其地活動者，必須與道批人交接，否則必會人財兩空。這個小城市的畸形發展，連昆明的冒險家也有點感到頭痛了。</p>
<p>兩地繁榮後　社會風氣受影響</p>
<p>冒險家在昆明和霑益，助長了兩地的繁榮，影響了兩地的風氣。昔日引車賣漿之流，春秋之間，判若兩人。觀其頣指氣使，炙手可熱之狀，常使正直熱衷之士，感到啼笑皆非，而一般迫於環境者，亦在有意無意中，相繼捲入了這種冒險投機的火瀑流裏，如此情勢，若再繼續發展，不知將伊於胡底。勝利之聲，變成了樂園的喪鐘，撞碎了冒險家的春夢。冒險家們相顧失色，羣　勝利來得太快了。誰曰：人心似海，慾　難塡，信不我欺。抗戰勝利後，一部份人仍在掙扎，發生了廻光返照的現象，實亦不足怪也。總之，今日的昆明，已在轉變，今日的霑益，日漸趨於平靜。兩地的發展雖難逆料，過去的樂園也許不會重現了。冒險冢們，廣大的收復區，正需你們這種精神去開發，田園已蕪胡不歸？</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>和平幸福的有力保障</h3>
<p>昨晨政治協商會議開幕，中央與共黨雙方頒發停止衝突的命令，這兩件天大的喜訊，不但使中國人民笑逐顏開，且使全世界關心中國政局的人士一致歡迎。美國奧論甚至說目前全世界最光明的視綫就是注射在中國。倫敦市塲的中國公債也因此漲價。中國人今天有這樣英斷的領袖，有這樣寬容的政府，有這樣可以捐棄成見而和衷共濟的黨派，中國人實在够興奮，够光榮，覺得前途光明無限。雖然日寇投降以來五個月間，我們曾因為不幸的內爭而萬分慚愧，可是到了昨天一草帽揭開，雲霧頓掃，大家心頭一塊沉重的大石從此放下去了。全國人民在百年恥辱和八年血戰以後所應享的和平幸福，也從此有了曙光。</p>
<p>我們讀了　蔣主　在協商會議的開幕詞和各會員的致詞，不但覺得和平幸福已有曙光，而且相信和平幸顯實在已獲得有力的保陣。這理由很簡單，要使人民享受和平幸福，先得尊重人民應有的地位與合法的權利，而人民的地位與權利之被尊重則有賴於參加政治活動的各黨派都能够眞正具備民主的風度。我們從這次協商會議開幕後的悄况來看，可以說政府和各方大抵都能體騐到這一點，都已次心培養那從事現代政治所必須的民主風度了。所以我們以爲今天可引爲喜慰的，在乎停戰命令的頒發者猶其次，而最難能可貴者，實在於各方面的政治人物都具有次心，發揮那民主風度。政治家有了民主風度，人民才眞能獲得和平幸福的保障。</p>
<p>我們從什麼地方看出來，各方人物都似乎已經具有民主風度呢？</p>
<p>首先，我們不能不稱頌　蔣主席領導精神的偉大。他在三人小組會議幾成僵局之際，慨允修改原來主張，使「停戰」命令卒能於昨晨協商會議開幕以前欣然發出</p>
<p>蔣主席開幕詞中所說，「爲了成立有效的決議，有時候撇消我們的提案，比之堅持我們的主張，更有偉大的價値」，這幾句光明磊落的話，他自己首先以身作則的做到了。不但如此，他並且一再說出，要眞誠坦白，要大公無私，要高瞻遠矚，而其所念念不忘的，是「今天我們人民最迫切的要求」。爲了實現人民最低限度的要求，安定復興的要求，安居樂業的要求，和平統一的要求，他以爲政府「祗有責任和義務的觀念，次沒有自私和得失之見，」因此，他希望這次會議「能始終保持諒解與和諧，」而他在會議開幕以前，毅然下令停止衝突，的確就是這種諒解與和諧的最顯著的象徵。尤其値得我們稱頌的，蔣主席在未經會議商討以前，正式宜布政府所決定的保障人民權利的四項辦法，使「人民之自由，」「政黨之合法地位，」「由下而上之普選，」與「政治犯之釋放，」從此可以見諸事實。我們往常總說，三民主義的政治，一定是走上民主大道的政洽，今天由於蔣主席偉大精神的感召，我們更相信國民黨所先天具備的民主精神必日益發揚而光大。我們所希望的，政府各主管部鬥，各級負責人員，都要仰體主席的民主精神，立即各就所司，力求此四項辦法之實現。惟有從事實上表現這四項辦法確收實效，中國可以說已經在民主大道上跨進了一大步。</p>
<p>其次，共黨代表周恩來氏的致詞，比之日寇投降初期朱德將軍的電報，大有霄讓之隔了。朱德將軍當時目中，何嘗有國民政府？亦何嘗顧念到中國人民？今天共黨代表能稱頌「蔣主席的遠見和次心，」能顧念到「人民的痛苦，」實在是進步了，也可以說有一些民主風度了。而最令我們感動的共黨代表今天已經知道只有「信賴人民，依靠人民，」並且希望各會員「對人民負責，對國家負責，」他們也「願以極大限度的容忍，」與各方共商國是。凡是一個政黨，原可以有政見，但亦不可偏執其「我見。」而民主國家的政黨，尤其需要反對黨來切磋琢磨，方能相得益彰。只要各個政黨能够稍稍化除僞執的我見，處處想到人民，時時想到國家，那未黨派與黨派之間，批評責難諒解容忍等等這些民主風度，自然不期其有而自有。日寇投降，共軍爭地，五個月來，所爲何事？「人民的痛苦」加深了！人民的呼籲也幾乎聲嘶力竭了。幸而今天共黨翻然覺悟，願「在先烈的昭示之下，在中山先生遺像之前，」痛下次心，「要永遠使中國不再發生內戰。」這眞是諒解以後的大澈大悟！我們並不希望政黨之間絕無批評責難，也不敢說政黨之間只許諒解容忍。但無論批評責難也好，諒解容、忍也好，總不能離開議塲，走上戰塲。我們以爲共黨拋棄戰塲重入議塲的民主精神，的確能永遠改變共黨今後的作風。我們也相信共黨今後必能體察人民的眞正願望，人民的迫切要求，而不爲共一黨的「我見」所囿。一個黨派萬不可以爲我黨我派的意見就是人民的意見，我黨我派的主張就是人民的主張。蔣主席說，「在憲政沒有實施以前，人民的眞正意志，還沒有充分表達的途徑。」的確，大家都有這種虛懷若各的精神，才能在共商國是的時候，常常去體騐人民的意志，顧全人民的幸福。</p>
<p>最後，願爲政治協商會議諸公進一言：這次會議，爲歷史上劃時代的會議。諸公雖非人民所選舉，而必須時時不忘人民！會議的進行，千千萬萬人民在鑒臨着！諸公受國民政府之聘，共商國是，取舍興革，動關國家大計，故容忍則可，敷衍則不可，諒解則可，遷就則不可。諸公應該克服任何困難，而不可動搖絲毫國本。諸公定必明白：政治協商會議會員雖非人民代表，協商會議更非國家主權行使的機構，而諸公旣已參加，就應該各本天良，「對人民負責，對國家負責。」諸公能負此責任，人民的和平幸福遂更可因諸公約共同努力而獲得堅强的保障。</p>

<p>烚赤昨初堅繼疲，不脫盤旋，市價較之證券公價雖云便宜，無如被扼於掛牌，難有特殊發展，各方對此盤覺躍躍欲試，泰半仍在待機中，晨初因陪都行市報俏，紙業帮有所補進，升爲八四萬三，多方活動並不持久，逢高北帮略吐，漲勢一遭阻遏，放空與出籠齊來，午刻又被撳壓至八二萬四，午後本極穩定，在八三萬五左右盤旋，孰料美鈔不能作結款之用，謠諑忽興，繼之不利於美鈔之傳說盛行，美鈔大疲，影響金市，最後在八二萬五左有，結果較前收略挫一千，銀樓飾金掛八萬九，紋銀七百元，銀元在四百六內外盤旋，暗拆市况依舊平庸，息價約八分至一角。</p>
<p>美鈔昨上午尙形平穩，隨金市而進退，錢兌業實貨頗多脫售，自一四四五元左右盤旋而下，午刻在一四三〇元內外盤旋，午後初時尙平，二時半後突傳美鈔不能作結款之用，跌至一四〇〇元，繼之又傳外幣禁止出口，及新匯率定一三六五元等說，遂破一四〇〇元大關而退至一三八〇元左右，結果較前收跌三十五元，尙是賣價。</p>
<h3>統丙繼續上漲　華股又復狂跳　外股走勢穩而俏</h3>
<p>公價昨因國共停戰令已發出，加之證交復業在即之說，晨開丙種即升至一二六〇元，空方亟補下，買戶更見興奮，步升至一三五〇元光景，後以股市略回，午刻在一三〇〇元關口徘徊，結果較前收計丙種尙漲一百元，甲乙則回跌五十元，丁種挫三十元，戊種跌十元，此乃時間關係，雜牌與熱門不能並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>華股昨市况混亂不堪，紙業帮逢高出籠，上塲由俏步疲，散戶紛紛放空，永紗自一一四〇元退至一〇六〇元，美亞八四〇元退至七七〇元，新光目六六元降至六二元以下，大戶翻雲覆雨，散戶莫衷一是，此後混亂萬分，近午尙形平穩，孰料午後茶號所拋大量信和紗廠，不能交貨，倡議結價了結，引起極大買風，成交以時間已晚，勢難普及，爲數有限，喊價在混亂中扳高極鉅，永紗曾在跳至一千二百五十元以上，美亞九百元外，三小熱亦被激，急漲一成左右，而後稍回，結果在促進生產及證交復業聲中，計永紗美亞各漲一百三十元，三小熱谷昇一成，冷門亦跟上頗多，投機氣氛濃重，達於沸點，物必自腐而後蟲生，愼防意外打擊外股繼續走俏，過程極見穩健，不若華股之為所欲爲，在利多之環境下，各股結果普遍再漲半成至一成不等。</p>
<h3>抑平物價聲中　米糧步漲不已</h3>
<p>招商局運到蕪米</p>
<p>米糧大津靑島吸胃仍濃，早薄稻續漲七八百元，北粳亦續升四五百元，秈米亦再加三四五百元不一，而白元陰元北洋亦有問津，隨之再漲五百元，黃豆閩化再活，疲而復振，加二三百元，油市忽上忽落，今因消化見多，上升三五百元，麵粉市勢雖挺，奈去胃轉懈，形趨呆木，豆餅南洋船位已滿，納戶轉淡，價回小百餘元，酒市平庸，生仁仍然挺站，之蔴相仿。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕蕪湖米大量到埠，本星期內，計到八千餘包，係招商局國泰國定飛波飛天飛敏等拖鐵駁裝來，聞尙有大批待運，故該局派江新輪今日前往蕪湖裝運，該項食米，均係糧食儲運處托裝，又有麵粉二萬三千包，由岳州輪運香港，係救濟品。</p>
<h3>倉庫出貨無期　人造絲露鋒芒　廠經價稍有進展</h3>
<p>絲綢連朝疲弱，昨市突又回漲，人造絲晨開即露鋒芒，一二〇號天橋八十五萬元，在一片買聲中傾刻漲至九十萬元，下午續做九十一萬元，棧單七十一萬五千元，較上日高八九萬元，究其上漲之原因，厥爲封閉在倉庫之絲出貨無期，造成現貨居奇，市價難望抑平，廠經略有活動，價稍進展，綢市初無起色，旋因原料激漲，一致提升，美亞被面每百條五十八萬元，民生識錦緞成交價每件九千元。</p>
<h3>紗價壓不住　粗細紗繼續上漲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市復趨高翔，良以客帮源源而來，採辦頗殷，如南京等帮專以小型紗廠價低色凈者爲對象，而同行交易亦頗熱鬧，以十六支光明為準則，計廿支及十六支紗較昨約漲三萬，細紗約升六七萬左右。</p>
<h3>茶市前途樂觀</h3>
<p>歐美需求華茶甚切</p>
<p>俄國已與茶商接洽</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市華茶國外銷路，因海運尙未暢通，又以當局對外匯率尙未公佈，致目前仍處於停頓狀態，據記者向該業方面有關人員獲得確實消息，歐美各國對於華茶需求殷切，更聞俄國政府有放棄統制之說，因此亦有動辦之勢，刻下已在與本市某茶商預事接洽中，惟今庚因產茶期已過，恐無相當發展，須俟明春新茶登塲云。</p>
<p>昨日茶市仍以津帮吸胃最强，而本街店莊等去化亦尙不惡，故人心繼續樂觀，價格方面亦甚堅稽。</p>
<h3>烟煤銷活</h3>
<p>烟煤塊走銷轉健，尤以一般炒貨店用戶競購堤塊為甚，是以行情突轉堅俏，烟煤屑則隨之振作，白煤市價雖仍站穩，在到貨絡續中，銷路不及以前暢達，本炭到貨較前批品質爲優，雖市氣疲軟，喊價則高。</p>
<h3>黑鐵坯子轉機</h3>
<p>二千磅黑鐵坯子，前聞國外有到貨，因此人心惶惶，價格一落千丈，半月之中，跌落竟達三分之二强，至本月初，更有以每只三十餘萬元挽售者，直到最近，始稍見轉機，蓋恐怖心理日久漸淡，而國外新定貨亦需四十餘萬，故目下現貨喊五十萬左右。</p>
<h3>十二號鉛絲缺貨</h3>
<p>十二號軟鉛絲，現有某帮託掮客採辦，爲數約需四五百擔左右，而市上存貨，此種花色最爲缺少，因此執貨者均欲待善價而沽</p>
<h3>紙價站定　囤戶脫貨求現</h3>
<p>洋紙漲勢漸定，因連日漲風，抬高不少，脫貨者認爲可以脫手，致供求趨平，昨日報載外匯率即將規定，且以物價爲標準，一般紙商咸以爲此項標準必以進出口雙方貨物兼籌並顧，現在紙價與戰前比例，實高出百貨數倍，若匯率一旦規定，其所謂以物價標準者，決不能以現行紙價爲依據，則此後必有大落之一日，故頗有脫貨求現之傾向，惟因存底太薄，無大量出籠，致市面猶在參差間站定。</p>
<h3>印刷業紛紛復業　向美定購機器</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕印刷業於抗戰期間停業者綦多，其橡皮印刷機械有被敵偽搬走，霸佔使用，或將石印機械（按石印今已不甚適用）自動拆毁，常作廢鐵售去，値茲抗戰勝利，勵行復員之際，染織等業商標圖案設計，以及烟廠之香烟紙封裝璜，均須印刷，需要良股，但該業中能復工印刷者殊不多覯，聞已積極向美國定購最新機械，以資彌補。</p>

<h3>商情撮要</h3>
<p>龍口粉干見新後，適値冬銷發動，粵帮辦胃甚活，故市勢上展至勁，昨市復見新高價。</p>
<p>金針菜以來源零星而銷胃不弱，因此漲風甚熾，昨頂莊好貨身色俱佳者，號盤扳緊。</p>
<p>柿餅因港帮動辦，價再挺升，瓜子亦隨之，黑棗再騰，紅棗以長紅貨缺，價較上市又開高，桃肉唯有中檔貨，售盤照升。</p>
<p>食糖４５白及本廠白現貨軋缺，再以客帮辦殷，市復劇升。</p>
<p>棉布前受中國紡織建設公司開售紗布之影響，市略疲軟，但其價並未絞市低廉，且須十天後方可提貨，廠號因之又回復舊觀</p>
<p>咸白桊杭帮頻頻採辦，行家以貨缺，均予扳持，趨勢緊俏。</p>

<p>市塲游資橫溢　新港票節節高　目標註定老貨對折　廣幫乘機大量拋出</p>
<p>港票老貨無投機作用，並扼於港地報小，結果跌五元，新貨全受證券帮所操縱，七五元左右步步高昇，午後竟喊高至九〇元以上，最後受外幣禁止出口等影響，回跌至八五元左右，結果尙較前收漲十一元，但屬賣價，查全日間廣帮存底傾售一空，三六年一字頭頗有缺貨之概，三七年籌碼較爲鬆動，大戶登高一呼，游資苦無出路，跟縱集中一門，操縱是道者初步目標爲老貨之對折，一百二十元之價，聞港地現價遠低於滬價，本日廣帮之大量拋出，即爲此故，投機家做手之浩大表演，誠令人嘡目。</p>

<h3>首都臨大昨已復課　學生代表赴敎授寓所挽留　並赴王主任所在醫院慰問</h3>
<p>〔本報南京急電〕臨大肇事被拘學生，于柏靑等九人，昨經法院偵訊後，八人寄押模範監獄，一人交保，當于等被押時，曾有女生六名，至市府請求馬市長寬恕，代請法院釋放未果。此案究將由法院提出公訴，抑由被害人王書林提請自訴，尙須視檢察處偵訊結果而定。今晨臨大已復課，前僞中央學生自治會，業無形解散，學生情緒，亦告寗靜。一般觀察，此次學潮起因於學生違法，現肇事學生旣了然於法律之尊嚴，以赤子心腸，敬謹接受法律之約束，可能得一「違法不可恕，靑年學子遠法大可哀」之結論，獲得從輕發落。此爲光復後茫茫學海中之惡潮，由於學生覺悟，法律尊嚴，該案得迅速解決，將成爲學風好轉之起點。</p>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕首都臨大一部份學生滋事，致該班主任王書林受傷，引起各敎授憤慨，全體提出辭呈。</p>
<p>學生貼標語歡迎王主任</p>
<p>學生中之大多數，因此影響，拋荒學業，曾有文字表示呼籲，滿貼「歡迎敎部黃司長來班督導！」「歡迎王主任來班主持！」「懇請各敎授打銷辭意從速復課！」「同學主持正義，打倒少數敗類份子！」等標語。敎部除派黃如今司長赴班督導外，於九日發表開除爲首滋事學生十四名，于柏靑，李樹棠，姚大鈞，孫滌，丁金城，歐陽臻，楊詩厚，嚴紀靑，王定世，趙中凱，左元良，瞿其林，易振，盛傳賢等。</p>
<p>地院檢查處拘押八學生</p>
<p>首都地方法院檢察處，以學生聚衆毆傷王主任，有涉刑事，定十日上午在院開偵察庭，拘到滋事學生九名，經檢察官初次偵察一過，學生八名收押，一名交保，聞將提起公訴，須受法律處分，有數學生，眼淚盈眶，此時悔之已晚。敎部黃司長如今，並於十日上午到班，召集臨大補習班全班學生訓話，由該班敎務長吳兆棠代表王主任主席，向學生致詞畢，即請黃如今司長訓話。</p>
<p>司長黃如今對學生訓話</p>
<p>黃司長略述去年九月敎部召集復員善後會議之經過，臨大補習班設立之主旨，係改造靑年思想，導入正軌，補充學識，使在偽校之學生，由此橋樑得入正式大學，以完成學業，王主任羅致名敎授多人，自數千里來京任敎，無非爲負有復興民族文化之重大使命，以完成敎育責任，今竟有少數學生，行動越軌，毆傷王主任，此不幸事件，當然係少數人之行爲，本人前曾來班視察，見多數學生，雖未上課，然均能守秩序，作筆記，自修溫課，現政府爲整飭學風，次犧牲少數人，〔仍由王主任名義佈告，奉敎部令開除學生十四人〕，以維護多數人之學業，如再發生不幸事件，必致解散，學生永久失學云云。</p>
<p>師生共決定十一日上課</p>
<p>繼由全體學生，當場推定代表林蔚靑等三人，懇請黃司長率領，往王書林主任所在醫院，及各敎授寓所，慰問幷挽留，同時幷公同決定十一日復課。于慰問挽留王主任及各教授時，特別提出，十一日定可上課云。（愚）</p>

<h3>晨友盃昨賽　華聯勝梁溪　晨友克率林</h3>
<p>晨友盃甲組賽二塲，相當精彩。第一塲晨友與綠林有關名次，乃競爭劇烈，上半時各八平等，下半時晨友時運來，反之綠林球運惡劣，晨友乃得以一九對一五獲勝。次塲華聯梁溪大戰，華聯保持常勝，輕取梁溪，上半時廿三對一二，總結果爲五十三對二四。另增挿油一塲，汕隊以廿八對廿二力克安都尼士。</p>

<h3>救救快要失學的孩子　一個當前值得注意的學費問題　請參看市敎育局所定學費標準</h3>
<p>編者先生；日前貴報傳出消息，謂本年春季調整學費，業經決定，大約小學一萬二千元，中學一萬六千元。這一個驚人的數目，簡直駭壞人！託得去夏中學（私立）學費，以　幣計算，動亂數十萬元，已是呌苦連天，目下米價仍然如故，而學費加得如此之大，「普及敎育」，反而是「加强失學」！倘若一家有兩個孩子，其學費就不堪籌措。現在每一個小職員，每月進益三五千元，是很普遍的，他家裏如果有兩個孩子，除支付學費之外，就沒有生活費了。若個個去想法得到貸學金才能就學，那敎育還能普及嗎？因此，鄙人擬借貴報一角，代爲呼籲：敎育當局可否將學費重行改訂，爲大衆着想，必須減輕學費。鄙人也是一個有孩子的人，假使這樣增加學費，實在無法負担，只好呌孩子失學，因爲鄙人乃是南貨店裹的小職員，沒有大收入。但是像我這棵情形的，上海地方正多得不可計數，請救救我們快要失學的孩子！</p>
<p>尤東昇謹啓</p>
<p>編者按：本市私立中小學三十四年度下學期學費標準，業經市敎育局於昨日（十一日）提交第十六次市政會議決議通過如次：</p>
<p>私立中小學三十四年度下學期學費，應照下列之規定，市區小學生每人應繳學費六千元，市區初中學生每人應繳學費九千元，市區高中學生每人應繳學費一萬二千元；，郊區小學生每人應繳學費四千元，郊區初中學生每人應繳學費六千元，郊區高中學生每人應繳學費九千元。以上數額爲最高額，圖書體育等費，各校應專案呈請市敎育局核准辦理。　市敎育局所定右列各項學費標準，已較尤君來函所述，減輕多多。</p>
<h3>勞作中心站的任務</h3>
<p>— 陸爾强</p>
<p>推動上海全市勞作敎育</p>
<p>遠在十年以前，政府鑒於敎育設施與國民實際生活之不能相應，乃在頒行之敎育實施辦法中，確定以「勞作」「生產」「實用」為各級敎育之核心，使「手的訓練」與「腦的訓練」同等重要，以期養成國民刻苦耐勞之精神，增進國民生產之技能。敎育部遂積極注意中小學勞作科目之設置，並於民二十三年十一月間，在首都舉行「全國職業學校及中小學勞作成績品展覽會」，證明中小學中之勞作訓練，具有實用價值，足以表現學校作業與社會生產之合一。於此，吾人瞭然在十年以前，敎育當局即已注重勞作訓練，且已培植良好之始基矣。</p>
<p>平幸七七事變發生，暴日侵襲，抗戰軍興，淪陷區內敎育事業，遭受敵僞摧殘，八年以來，陷於凋零之境。今抗戰勝利，天日重光，蔣主席已屢次昭示，敎育復興爲建國之急務，在其手著之「中國之命運」一書中，列舉實行實業計劃最初十年內所需建設人才，約爲各級學校畢業生二百五十萬人。由此可見欲國國家復興，非賴積極建設不可；積極建設，非賴實科人才不可；而培養實科人才，尤非賴手腦並重之敎育基礎不可。</p>
<p>上海市之敎育事業，向居全國重心，中小學校數量之多，為全國冠。今租界已廢，敎育行政統一，市敎育當局，均為工程界前輩，仰見政府重視滬市敎育之復興，更重視實科敎育之積極培養。今後本市中小學設施，必將恢復勞作，列為重要科目之一。惟是事實上各校或限於經濟，或昧於潮流，對於勞作科目及應用設備，不免忽略簡陋。爲彌救計，非市敎育當局領導主持不可，茲已由市敎育局社會敎育處主辦市立勞作中心站，以推進勞作敎育爲宗旨，正在積極籌備中，所訂各種規程，下學期起即付實施，俾使本市勞作敎育納入正軌，配合建國需要敎育與生產合一之旨，漸臻國家於富强之途。茲節錄該站實施方針如下：</p>
<p>（一）設立金工，木工，黏土工，竹工，籐工等實習工塲若干所，凡本市公私立中小學校，尙未按照部頒勞作課程標準辦理者，（依據市敎育局督導處視察報告，）排定日程，通知該校敎員帶領學生到站實習。</p>

<h3>漢奸財產判決後處理　日僑資產須交出　劉攻芸昨答記者問</h3>
<p>（本報訊）上海區處理敵偽產業審議委員會主委彭學沛、處理局局長劉攻芸，於昨日下午四時半，在仁記路中國銀行大樓該局會議室舉行茶會，招待新聞記者，計到各報各通訊社記者六十餘人，彭劉二氏以及處理局各組長亦均準時出席。首由彭學沛報告該局處理工作經過，（全文另錄）次劉攻芸答新聞界所提出各問題。</p>
<p>標售各廠開放三天</p>
<p>劉局長繼稱，處理局成立之前，已有其他機關紛紛接收，故該局成立之後，主要工作即為對此加以調整。目前黨政接收委員會已解散，房地產接收委員會已改組為該局房地產組，其主要工作為對盟國人士所有之房地產加以審核及發還。德僑管理處以前接收之財產，已移交該局第四組。第三方面軍之軍品接收委員會現在亦已吿一段落，將其所接收之軍品交至軍政部。劉氏旋對各記者紛紛提出問題，一一加以答覆。其主要者為（一）各倉庫所存報紙，已分四批配給各報，最近宋院長已電台灣陳長官，要求於舊歷年內運報紙來滬，以應急需。（二）該局所最感困難者為汽車之分配，該局成立之前，敵偽汽車，已由各方接收，故追究極感困難。（三）現由局方保管之水汀，為數不多，供求成十與一之比，故對於聲請者無法圓滿解決。水汀至多祇有牌號，證明所有權極難，故聲請發還者，有一部份已接受代價，而寗願犧牲水汀。（四）出售平價糖之店面及地址，已在報端發表，如有非法拒售，歡迎吿發。（五）各工廠於標　之前，均開放三日，可以參觀。（六）平賣布屢經調查，恐流弊尚少，油及魚之平賣，調查較難，或有疏於防範之處，自當改　。但平賣之目的，直接固為使買主受益，而間接為抑平物價，　則因本局之平賣，殊已收效。（七）日僑撤退後，其房屋如原主能夠證明產權，且確無附逆行為者，即予發還，否則由局支配。承租是項房屋之機關應出租金，其契約可由承租人與房主自行簽訂。</p>
<p>物資數量布疋最多</p>
<p>（八）物資數量因倉庫尚未點完，不能報告，但其中以布匹為最多，糧食較少，軍用品亦多。（九）海軍所接受之倉庫均已交海關點收，短缺情形在淸查中。（十）朝鮮及台灣人民所有之工廠，如無附敵悄事，可以發還，否則沒收。（十一）各工廠以前被迫合作而交出之貨物，以布疋為最多，但以前沒收時敵偽曾付代價，而布疋極難認明所有權，故發還極感困難。（十二）姜公美所接收之物資，前已交至三方面軍，現存該局偵緝組，詳情待查。（十三）日僑臨行時，需將資產交出，該局已與日僑管理委員會取得合作，將來擬覓一巨厦，安置此類物品。（十四）本市各廠商前受敵偽壓迫強制合作，或非法收買其廠產，在勝利後，經上海區敵偽產業處理局分別予以沒收之規定，彼等因不服審議，而羣起抗　。記者曾以此問題向該處理局探詢意見，當蒙劉局長答稱：強制合作與收買，雖為事實，然此輩商人，當時並非毫無利益，故局方對此不擬加以考慮。本報記者，（一）倉庫失竊案查辦經過情形若何，劉氏答，每一竊案，局方均已送政院，現在澈查中。（二）漢奸財產，須俟判決後，始得處理。（三）首批平賣之紗襪及面盆，現已售完，但尚有紗襪二萬雙，面盆三萬只，即可出售。</p>

<h3>楊文道　請准予保出調養</h3>
<p>（本報訊）十年前為協文道義務辯護之唐懷羣律師頃吿記者，楊案刻已由主席批交司法行政部辦理，足見政府維持法律尊嚴之決心。惟十年前審訊此案之時，人人皆知日人欲藉機完遂其政治上之陰謀，即本人義務承辦此案，亦全係出於義憤，故楊文道亦未始不可認為政治犯。今因反日被捕之政治犯均已先後獲釋，而楊文道以衰病之身，至今仍　囧　，萬一瘐斃獄中，寗非冤沉海底。唐氏已呈請司法行政部，請求先予保出調養，靜候審判。又十年前向日探長吿發楊文道為兇手之廣東人花柳病醫師　惠民，已於二十七年間，因充當漢奸而在廣州槍決。</p>

<h3>南京西路　將決予寬拓</h3>
<p>（本報訊）市府以南京西路（靜安寺路）跑馬廳一帶，馬路尚欠寬放，以致車輛充塞，交通不便，頃已決定拓寬至二十七公尺，較目前需加闊十八至二十八英尺。按照此項計劃，除跑馬廳旁之河浜須加填平外，該處隕牆亦須拆除，並須讓出牆內跑道之一部。至於實施計劃，市府已令工務地政二局會同擬訂。</p>
<p>放寬界路　計劃擬就</p>

<p>楊錫光</p>
<p>四十三歲，山東人。偽成都路警局特高科科長，專為敵司情報工作。勝利後為人檢舉，將楊拘捕。該案昨由祝宗海推事承審。據楊供稱，任特高科科長確有其事，曾奉命逮捕我在滬負責空軍聯絡情報之韓振　，但韓被捕後，彼曾力阻將韓解往敵憲兵司令部，且設法將其保出，以後並擔任地下工作云。繼由韓妻朱啓蓀稱確有其事，但因韓本人現已往渝，未能親自作證，故庭諭待韓本人之證明到後，再行審理。被告不准交保，仍還押。繼由曹駿推事審訊。</p>
<p>陳伯華</p>
<p>陳四十二歲，浙江紹興人，持志學院法商科畢業。曾任偽交通部駐滬辦事處副處長，偽社會部參事，及偽兩路特別黨部常務委員等職。勝利後由黨部檢舉被捕，但陳供稱擔任偽職，係被「七十六號」所威逼，但後曾以此掩護。與在瑞士領事館任秘書及法律顧問，擔任地下工作之艾國藩取得聯絡，不斷供給情報。自稱並無危害國家等罪云。庭諭因艾國藩今日未到，待詳　調查及傳訊後再行審詢。下午於原處續審。</p>
<p>張金根</p>
<p>張為　定日本野戰倉庫之工頭兼翻譯，於南國酒家為靑年團員所捕。但張供並無危害地方等情，並由指定律師葛之覃辯護。庭諭調查完畢，定期宣判。繼由劉毓桂庭長承審。</p>
<p>方祖德</p>
<p>方在吳淞日憲兵隊任司機及翻譯之職，有仗勢霸佔民房等情。但方供稱，租屋經合法手續，並非霸佔。因舉發人王德慶未到，庭諭案情尚待調查，改期再訊。</p>
<p>又訊，今日上午將續有張益之等漢奸案開審。</p>

<h3>助我撤退在華日人　美軍部擬定計劃　迄今已有廿萬人被遣歸</h3>
<p>美軍總部今日宣佈，協助我國遣送日僑回國之工作，刻在加緊進行中。截至目前為止，被撤退回國之日人，共計二十萬人。依據一九四六年一月報告，日人之在中國北部，上海以及台灣被撤者，共二〇二·〇三一人。</p>
<p>據根一九四五年八月十五日報告，日人之在中國，台灣，安南，東九省，海南島者，共三·五〇五·七八二人，台灣人則有四一·六五一人，韓人有五六·六六二人。現在美軍先行</p>
<p>撤退日人台灣人，韓人之撤退工作，尚未開始。助我撤退日人，台灣人，韓人回本土之工作，將於本年九月三十日全部完成，此乃根據美軍運輸部之詳細計劃而定者。運輸日人回國之船隻共三十四艘，皆為日本船，並連同登陸船九十艘，船上仍用日本水手。現在每日撤退日人</p>
<p>約七千名下週可增至一萬人。二月一日起，預計可增至一萬五千人，至今年七月一日，每日被撤退之日人數目，可增至二萬五千人。美軍運輸署長韋特蒙上校稱，撤退日人之船隻，均有麥克阿瑟元帥總部支配，美軍總部在撤退日人之工作，將受麥帥之指示。本月十五日，麥帥將在東京召見各撤退日人之美軍</p>

<p>審訊戰犯　宣告延期</p>
<p>美戰犯審判委會，對於審判戰犯之籌備工作，已全部完成。以未得華府方面開審命令，其審判戰犯之工作，一再告延，而服務該委會之一部美軍長官數人，亦以服務積點已足，於數日前離華返國。該委會數　　示美國政府，　未獲具體答覆，故美軍在滬審判該等日戰犯五十一名，及其他國籍之叛逆工作，將不能依期執行。</p>
<p>兩批日俘　即將遣歸</p>
<p>第十批及第十一批日俘，均已於昨前兩日集中檢查，登輪遣歸。第十批共計三二六六人，第十一批計三二三九名。下週遣歸人數，當再增加。京滬區日俘管理局當局，刻正考慮本市調役之日俘，是否應調返集中遣歸，或使其繼續服役，而先行遣送由無錫鎮江各地來滬之日俘。</p>

<p>據本市房屋租賃管理委員會悉，該處受理之租賃調解案件，截至目前為止，已達二千八百五十七起，有經調解而和平解決者，但亦有幾經調解，不能解決者。至因戰爭而離屋之租戶，八年中從未與屋主交涉遷回之住戶，該負責人認為無論該屋地處南市·虹口·或滬西及市中心等之居戶，祇須因戰爭而避難他處，未經退租手續者，均可請求遷回。如屋主（大二房東）無故阻撓，可逕向該房屋租賃管理委員會三樓調解組，填寫申請調解表格，請求公斷。</p>

<h3>彭學沛報告　敵偽產業處理概況　淸點庫房尚需一月　標售工廠八十三家</h3>
<p>彭學沛氏昨在招待記者席上報告「二月來敵偽產業處理概況」，計分十二項敘述，足使社會對處理敵產，有比較具體之認識，茲錄原文如次：</p>
<p>上海區處理敵偽產業審議委員會及處理局成立於卅四年十月廿九日，迄今已二月有餘，所有敵偽產業之處理，均係遵照行政院頒布之敵偽產業處理辦法辦理，茲將二月餘各種敵偽產業處理情形簡述如左：</p>
<p>碼頭倉庫</p>
<p>倉庫為物資總匯，故接收工作，最為繁重，且物資品類，質料不一，必須詳細鑑定，並計算江海關經常派遣外勤員工五百餘人，分組工作，截至一月九日止，各倉庫已由海關加封管理者有二四七單位，合計七六九庫房，其中已淸點物資竣事者，有一二七單位，計四六九庫房，其餘正在儘連淸點中，約一個月可望完竣。至盟國商民倉庫約二百座，已淸點物資發還原主者約有半數，華商及銀行業倉庫一三六處，已着手淸理　別物資分別發還倉庫噸位已由江海關儘量　空備物資抵滬時儲藏之用。</p>
<p>工廠</p>
<p>依照處理辦法規定工廠設備原料成品，係委託經濟部接收，業經該部接收者計三二九廠，除撥交資源委員會者十六廠，應撥交紡織工業管理委員會者廿廠，共有紗錠九十三萬餘枚，線錠二十二萬餘枚，及布機一萬六千餘台，又撥交中華蠶絲公司者十一廠，先後兩次決定標售者，八十三廠，發還者一百十五廠，其餘各廠之處理，正在儘速辦理中。</p>
<p>房地產</p>
<p>敵偽房地產規定先儘政府機關及公營事業運用，截止上年底申請者已達四百七十三單位，雖各機關接收房屋共有六一六單位，惟因（一）接收機關多在使用接收房屋，（二）一部分較大房屋為美軍借用，（三）民產經陸續發還，（四）日僑集中區須待日僑遣歸方有大量房屋空出等原因，供求尚難適應，當以敵偽房屋淸理產權後為數並不甚多，非經濟使用，不足以減輕屋荒程度，爰經報告宋院長，當蒙指示：（一）敵偽房屋非經行政院核准撥租，不得使用，凡經行政院核准撥租之機關使用該項房屋時，任何機關不得　故拒絕，（二）與軍事設備工廠倉庫農塲學校無關連之房屋，均應交出統籌，（三）軍事機關及部隊，一律使用敵人原有司令部軍營及官佐住宅，並將所住普通房屋騰出，上項軍營及官佐住宅，應保留一部分交警備司令部備供過境官兵暫駐之用，（四）市政府所屬機關儘量就收回之地方公產及工部局公產中支配運用，各區黨部及團部警察局及保衛團以合用房屋為原則，（五）中央在滬申請房屋機關先請其主管部會核明有無在滬設立機構需要及員額編制房租預算核實支配等各點刻正分別洽辦，又敵偽房地產之運用規定為出租及出售兩項，若干機關尚認為可由政府指撥不需何項費用，亦為申請過多原因之一。</p>
<p>運輸工具</p>

<h3>軍備　潛艇探索器</h3>
<p>— 從智</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰初期中，德國的所謂Ｕ字艇的潛水艇（Ｕ-boat德名是U-boot即Uotersee　boot　意義，就是潛水艇）橫行在大西洋一帶，擊沉了許多聯合國方面的軍艦和商船；但從來終於銷聲匿跡，這就是聯合國應用『索匿』無綫電浮標（Sonoradio　buoy）積極掃蕩的結果。這章秘密到最近方才透露。</p>
<p>利用雷達或瞭望的探索方法，對於留在水面上的潛艇固然是很有效果的，但對於躱在水面下的潛艇就不中用了。『索匿』無綫電浮標能使飛機生了『耳朶』，可以聽到水面下Ｕ字艇的聲音，測知它的方位並且追踪着。旣經探知敵方潛艇踪跡的飛機，可以自行加以攻擊，或者招呼就近的驅逐艦前去殲滅它。</p>
<p>追擊的飛機又可以從『索匿』無綫電浮標得悉攻整的結果情形，只要聰取水下的聲響就得了。有時還可聽到Ｕ字艇的螺旋槳聲，這是它臨陣脫逃時發出的聲音。有時只有砰然一聲巨嚮，接着是異常靜寂，那就表示Ｕ字艇被毁滅了。</p>
<p>據美國國防研究委員會的泰德博士（Ｊohn　Ｔ.Ｔate）說，『索匿』無綫電浮標是該委員會第六組的成就，研究工作是在康乃蒂克州紐倫敦市（Ｎew　Ｌunpon）的海軍部水聲學實騐室完成的。</p>
<p>泰德博士說：『索匿』無綫電浮標不是一個發明家偶然受到靈感而發明的。它是由一羣受信任的科學家和工程師，跟大西洋中潛艇作了長時期的密切接觸所得到的結果。』</p>
<p>他說『索匿』無綫電浮標的理想，並非是新奇而毫無根據的。它其實是從海軍研究所的一種笨重的繫着式的浮標脫胎而來的。那種舊式的浮標，是在無法敷設水底電話的電續時用來保護港口的。但把這種東西載在飛機上，以便參與潛艇掃蕩戰，却是新鮮的想頭。</p>
<p>這種改良所得的『索匿』無綫電浮標，必須有輕巧的形體，以便大量裝載在飛機上，有低廉的成本以合實際應用，並且有堅固的結構，足以忍受波浪的冲擊。此外，它必須用蓄電池作電源，維持數小時之久，而且須有適當的無綫電波段和充分的電波强度。</p>
<p>探索敵方潛艇的飛機，先把一個『索匿』無綫電浮標投到水裏。浮標就浮在水中，用水底電話話筒收取水下的聲昔，把聲波改變爲微小的電壓波動，再在浮標的發射機部分經過放大後變成無綫電波放到空中。飛機上的收無綫電的人就可扭到與浮標發報機相同的週率而聽取聲響了。</p>
<p>聽報的人很容易學會分辨自然的水下聲音和外來的水下雜聲，例如潛艇的螺旋槳聲。飛機上人員一旦測知水下潛艇的方位後，就可以傳話給驅逐艦基地，立即派艦來攻擊敵方潛艇。飛機可以盤旋在該地上空。而且可以緊追着敵艇，一路投下『索匿』無綫電浮標，隨時測出它的方位。</p>

<h3>月亮確是外國的好</h3>
<p>— 溯因</p>
<p>「月亮也是外國的好」，我認爲這句話具有它的眞實性，而沒有加以識刺的理由。</p>
<p>一幅以人物或任何東西爲主體的圖畫必須配以優美適宜的背景，纔能烘托出那主體的美，這是誰都懂得的繪畫訣巧。圖畫如比，實際上的景物又何嘗不然？　　為主體的　景的，無論在　畫中抑或實際景物中，除了自然界的雲霞，山水等外，人工的點綴也是不可或缺的。</p>
<p>在外國，一個月亮掛在一個建築藝術化的敎堂尖頂上，溶溶的月光瀉在一片綠色整齊的草坪上，和白色寬坦的大道上；道旁的樹木是那麼的修齊挺秀，遠處錯落散處的村舍又是那麼的古雅有致，再加上藍天白雲，遠山流水，這整個景象所給予賞月者的印象無疑是優美的，可愛的，同時也就覺得月亮是晶瑩，圓滿，月色是分外的幽美有詩意了。雖然在外國的月亮未必處處有着這樣的背景，但類似的情境大槪是很多見的。</p>
<p>可是在中國的月亮呢，你會找到像在外國的那樣的陪襯嗎？雲天山水也是有的，但是敎堂，草坪之類，完全人工和半人工的優美的點綴却難以找到了。所有的，至多是那些荒城殘堞，蕭寺古剎，茅舍孤舟，甚至是累累荒塚，一片叢莽。在這種情景下，月亮祗會顯得孤冷，慘淡，淸　，給予你的感覺是蕭條，淒涼，甚至是陰森可怕，與在外國的月亮所引起你的情緒——優美，怡適相較，你會說「中國的月亮好」嗎？</p>
<p>至於「老子也是外國的好」，那更是不容否認的事實了，在外國，做父母的進過父母訓練學校（那並不是希罕的事）的，當然是更懂得怎樣做個合理的父母，就是沒有受過此項特殊訓練的，也因一般的敎育水準高，他們都有比較開明的頭腦，都能以比較合理的熊度與方法去對待和敎養子女。這與家國一般的父母——頑固，專制，無知相較，你會說「中國的老于好」嗎？</p>
<p>「短自己的志氣，長他人的成風」這固然是要不得，但我們爲甚麼不去消除這種「短氣」話發生的根原，而祗是抹煞了這種話的眞實性而反脣相議呢？西園</p>

<h3>道德講座聽講記</h3>
<p>— 西園</p>
<p>在聲色貨利，金迷紙醉的上海，而竟有一個道德講座，每星期公開演講，來提倡道德，挽救末俗，確是一樁難能可貴的事。這個講座，是由孔聖學會，寗波同鄉會，崇德會，道德學會，四國體合辦的。地點在成都路滄洲書塲，每星期日上午講演一次，聽衆每次約有二三百人，十二月三十日，余曾往聽講一次，對於身心修養，很覺有些心得。</p>
<p>這天講師有兩位：一是楊中一，一是孫翔仲。楊講的題目，叫『率性之道』。先把大意寫在黑板上，內容分『性功」與『命功』兩大綱：性功，又分知性，存性，養性，盡性四小目。命功：亦分知命，俟命，無命，立命四小目。這種心性之學，本來極不易講，而楊講得頭頭是道，確不客易。孫講的題目，是『擁護眞理？尋求眞樂』。在黑板上寫了八個大字，是『賢親樂利』，和『身心性命」。大意是說中國從來講理學的人：多偏重於『賢其賢，親其親』，而輕視『樂其樂，利其利』。又只講性命之學，而不知身心之道，就是只重內心，而忽視外物，不免落於空疏，以後務須調和起來，不可偏重一面，方合眞理與得眞樂云。這些學問，原是舊學，而孫講得推陳出新，確是可佩。</p>
<p>講到午時完畢，我匆匆歸家，一路想到這個講座，在這人心　首敎　的時候，確有好處，因此我有幾點意見，　來貢獻于主辦者。（一）講的內容，勿偏於舊道德，須融合古今中外學說，而創造中國新道德。（二）講的材料，勿偏干中國儒釋道三敎，凡與道德有關的哲學，倫理，心理，藝術，美學等，亦可闡揚。（三）聽衆除成年人外，須吸收上海工商界靑年，以及學校學生。（四）每次講詞，須紀錄起來，擇其有系統的付印成册，以廣流傳。以上四點，是我從聽衆的立塲提出來的希望，十分粗淺。不知講座當局，以爲怎樣？</p>

<h3>發現原子　分裂之夜</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>那天是一九三九年一月二十五的晚上，天氣很冷，括着大風。那天晚上，美國哥倫比亞大學內，物理學家鄧寗博士第一次將鈾的原子分裂開，第一次發明施放原子能。</p>
<p>陣陣寒風從赫德遜江上吹來，吹亂了校內牆上的藤蔓。那天早晨，學生正大考，都圍着圍巾，在普平物理實騐室內出出進進，担心着物理二一三（熱力動力學），和其他物理課程。那天早晨，鄧寗博士的同事費密博士曾去看鄧，兩人談論着科學和科學家。因爲有一個助敎才從普靈士頓大學回來，說丹麥物理學家飽聶爾從歐洲來，他臨動身前，聽到韓恩博士在柏林發現了鋇同其他幾種中量原子重的原素，係具有輻射力的物質發出中性電子後，從被分裂的鈾的廢滓中尋出的。據說，韓博士當時曾說『我身爲化學家，一看到　，就和這它是甚麼；我身爲物理學家，看到這種現象，簡直不知道怎樣去解釋。』其實這不過是最重的原素，經分裂後，成爲較輕的原素。在這過程中，原子力隨着放射出來。現在大家雖覺得這很簡單，但當時確是一種新奇難解的事情。鄧寗同費密對原子能的問題感到很深的興趣。他們有一具機器，可以量這種能，於是他們遂討論起來：液體的鈾，同體的鈾，氣體的鈾，究竟那一種做實騐最適合？他們一齊去進午餐，午餐時繼續討論這問題。費密那天下午要去華盛頓，參加一個科學會議，臨別時二人仍不曾決定用甚麼物質去實騐。</p>
<p>鄧寗那天下午一直在辦事室內思索這問題。到了六點鐘，他冒着風回去，仍想不出來。他同妻子在公寓內同進晚餐，晚餐將畢時，他忽然想到，最好用固體的鈾去實驗。於是他冒着風又趕往辦事室去，他放下大衣同帽子，逕到地下室的實騐室裏去。那時是七點才過，他開始整理他的機器，機器講起來很簡單：是一隻夾子，上面安好施放輻射綫的物質，一個容器，裏面安好受衝射的物質；一個記震器，籍一幅幕上顯出的點綫，記出某種物質受衝射後發出的能量。（普通鈾不受衝射時發出的輻射光綫，在幕上祇現出點子。）</p>
<p>鄧寗博士把一片很薄的鈾放在夾子裹，把一些鈹鐳的混合劑作施放輻射綫，放在容器裏，將儀器略加整視，就開始實騐了。此時實騐室內還有兩位科學家：哥倫比亞大學的步友勒博士，同梵德比大學的史拉克博士。二人穿着白色的罩衫，因爲他們才作核子物理實騐，現在正忙着淸理一些儀器。鄧博士却穿着一套棕色的衣服。三個人心中都在想，這實騐大槪是不會成功的。可是，當鄧才把放鐳的夾移到放射的地方時，記震器的幕上突現出綠色波狀的綫條，好像直從幕上跳下來。『啊！』鄧說，『這簡直像是眞的嗎！」步同史一齊走過去，一看到這驚人的綫條。也極度震驚起來。鄧心中有些疑惑。他說他的機器一定出了毛病。步史兩人同他爭執起來。步呌道，『你這機器不是已用了好幾個月！你明知道這對的。』史也嚷道，『這機器是不會錯的！』三人要察騐機器是否準確，決定把一片鎘放在輻射綫經過的地方。鎘的性質是不能透過輻射綫的。他們再把輻射綫放出時，記震器的幕上一些綫條都不見了。他們又用了許多試騐，到了九點鐘時候，鄧博士帶着肅懼的神情，承認原子能的施放居然實現。</p>
<p>三人講好暫時不將這秘密洩漏。鄧一人重又回到辦事室內，外面朔風怒號着，他一人研究了整整三個鐘頭，計算他適才放出的原子能，每一原子的能究有多少。他的結論是，那天晚上，他所施放的原子能，約一萬二千萬至二萬萬伏打。像這般大力量，人類有史以來是從未夢想到的。</p>
<p>那時已近深夜，鄧寗博士把他計算出的數字隨手放開，離開辦事室回家去，在寒風中兀自沈思着。鮑鍾佐</p>
<p>軼事</p>
<h3>國籍問題</h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾佐</p>
<p>據美國著名專欄作家溫齊爾報告：某日晚餐後，羅斯福，邱吉爾及史太林三人閑談中，曾互詢各人如不屬於現有的國籍，願爲何國的人民。邱氏說：『如果我不是不列顚人，我願爲美國人民。』羅氏說：『如果我不是美國人，我願爲不列顚人民。」史氏說：『如果我不是蘇聯人民，我將感到自羞。』</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>日俘的零用費</h3>
<p>— 屈伸</p>
<p>報載：『浙江方面日俘官兵全體曾稱：今本國至此境地，所有日軍官兵均應刻苦自勵，不願再增添國家負担；所發零費，全數退還，不敢收納』。又京方日俘則　反，已　　我方送發。我軍政部送日俘零用費，是優待他們；他們不敢接受，豈非不受抬舉嗎？其實這是他們愛國心的發揚。我們須各自警惕！</p>
<p>我國此次勝利，所付代價極大。雖名爲勝利，然瘡痍滿目，民不聊生；凡我國民積極方面應奮力建設新中國，消極方面應儘量節約，不　無謂的靡費：少一分支出，即多一分收入。</p>

<h3>中比鐳錠醫院　亟應收歸我國辦理　讀者來函申述內幕實情</h3>
<p>編者先生：這不能不算是一大憾事！我們抗戰八年，取得勝利，整整的四個月了，我不明白衛生當局爲什麼把這個我國僅有的「中比鐳錠醫院」忽略了去！讓它潔白的身軀，依然蒙上灰色的外衣！中比鐳錠醫院的經費，是以中比庚款創設的，是公款，它的性質應該是爲大家謀福利的一所醫院，但事實上恰恰相反，因爲由外人把持，無形之中就顯出了它有着特殊的意味哩，該院醫藥費定得最高，而且收支都不公開，對在院服務的中國員役薪給待遇，是刻薄得無以復加。但是幾個外籍護士待遇就優越了。最近復將我們中國常局所委的一位醫務長排擠得幾乎不能做下去，住院的病者都是中國人，已有十多天沒有醫師看病了！</p>
<p>編者先生：請你試想，我們的國家在這次戰爭中吃盡千辛萬苦，不是把已往的恥辱湔雪乾凈，收回一切主權嗎？這個醫院當然要歸還我國，怎能够再讓外人來把持呢？素仰貴報是民衆的喉舌，所以我冒昧的草這信來希望借一角篇幅，公諸大衆，好讓當局注意，快些把它接收回來，使它潔白的身軀，披上神聖的外衣，國家幸甚，民衆幸甚！此祝撰安　羅志敬上</p>

<h3>詢助學　手續</h3>
<p>編輯先生：下面一個問題，敬請先生借報端一角答覆爲荷。我一向是甲報受助學生，（高中）在今年暑期中赴屯溪上學，勝利之後，囚學費昂貴等問題，我又趕回上海續學，但靑報助學金已過期，不曾中請領取。本學期又將結束，而我家庭經濟狀况，並未好轉，故擬續請助學金，不知手續如何？漏去一期，是否依照新生論？即祈公開詳答爲盼。讀者程金禺謹上</p>
<p>（答）本屆受助生，均經甄試合格，該生未及參加，照章不能享受舊生待遇。惟對家境淸寒，無力升學，極表同情。下屆助學，本報已決定與上海敎育貸金委員會合作辦理，今後可向該會申請，詳細辦法，請注意本欄新聞。</p>

<h3>Second and Third Sessions of the Consultative Conference: Discussion of Agenda and Inspection Team; Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai Give Separate Reports; Candidates for the Military Mediation Department Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Office, 11th Dispatch] (1) The Political Consultative Conference only held its opening ceremony yesterday, and the actual agenda will only begin today. The conference is scheduled to be held every morning so that the representatives can engage in off-site activities and exchange opinions in the afternoon. Today, because the Standing Committee of the National Political Council is scheduled to meet in the morning, some of the representatives have to attend, so the first formal meeting today will be changed to begin at 3:00 p.m., first discussing the issue of ceasefire. At the opening of the Consultative Conference, Chairman Chiang first announced the issuance of a ceasefire order, and the government's decision to guarantee people's freedom, recognize the legal status of political parties, implement universal suffrage, and release political prisoners and other new measures, which were all considered to have given the Consultative Conference a very good start. Regarding the reorganization of the government and the National Assembly representatives, although opinions differ, the distance is not too far, and it is not difficult to compromise, so the general attitude towards the progress of the consultation is optimistic.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Office, 11th Dispatch] (2) It is reported that the Military Mediation Executive Department will be established soon to implement the provisions of the ceasefire military conflict consultation. According to well-informed sources, of the three members of the Executive Department, in addition to the Chargé d'Affaires of the US Embassy, ​​Robinson, the most likely US representative is Lieutenant General Luoji, Commander-in-Chief of the US Army in North China, and the CCP representative has been determined to be Mr. Ye Jianying. It is heard that the government representative has been decided as Mr. Zheng Jiemin, Director of the Second Department of the Military Command. According to relevant sources: Marshal Marshall will fly to Pingjin within days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th Dispatch] The second meeting of the Political Consultative Conference was held at 3 p.m. on the 11th, still in the National Government. The members who attended were Wang Yunwu, Guo Moruo, Li Zhuchen, Zhang Maisheng, Qian Yongming, Zeng Qi, Yu Jiaju, Chen Qitian, Chang Naide, Yang Yongjun, Sun Ke, Fu Sinian, Shen Junru, Zhang Shenfu, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, Chen Lifu, Luo Longji, Zhang Dongsun, Miao Jiaming, Dong Biwu, Wang Ruofei, Ye Jianying, Lu Dingyi, Wu Tiecheng, Hu Lin, Zhou Enlai, Wu Yuzhang, Deng Xianchao, Wang Shijie, Shao Congen, Shao Lizi, and Chen Buxiao. There were 35 members from Zhang Qun. Mo Dehui, Zhang Junli, and Zhang Lan were absent. Chairman Chiang appointed Member Sun Ke as the temporary chairman. After Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported the number of members present, the chairman announced the meeting, and Members Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai successively reported on the negotiation process regarding the cessation of military conflicts and the restoration of transportation. After the report, Members Liang Shuming, Wang Shijie, Zeng Qi, and Zhang Youfu raised opinions and inquiries regarding the report. Member Zhou Enlai explained the area of ​​military conflicts and said that detailed materials are still to be collected by the Military Mediation Executive Department. Then the agenda of the meeting and the issue of the military inspection team were discussed. Members Liang Shuming, Zhang Maisheng, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Shenfu, Wang Yunwu, Shao Lizi, Fu Sinian, Wu Tiecheng, Zeng Qi, Shen Junru, Dong Biwu, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Dongsun, and Luo Longji all put forward their opinions, and it was decided: (1) Regarding the agenda of the meeting, the Secretary-General is authorized to list the issues and schedule them according to the two major items of the peaceful nation-building program within the scope of the consultation and the issues related to the convening of the National Assembly. (2) Regarding the issue of the military inspection team, the various parties and social elites shall negotiate and appoint eight participants. (3) Regarding the reports of Members Zhang and Zhou in this meeting, the Secretariat shall draft a resolution and submit it to the next meeting. Finally, Secretary-General Lei announced that the third meeting would be held at 9:00 p.m., and the government representatives and the CCP representatives would report on the progress of the talks between the two parties. (Zhou Enlai's report will continue to be published tomorrow.) At half past six, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<h3>The Army Must Be Nationalized; The Government Advocates Establishing a Three-Person Panel for Discussion; The Army Headquarters Has Ordered the Implementation of Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 11th Dispatch] At the first meeting of the Political Consultative Conference today, the government and the Communist Party representatives had a heated debate on whether the issue of army nationalization should be discussed by the Consultative Conference or by a three-person panel. The joint communiqué issued on October 10 stipulated the establishment of a three-person panel. The government adhered to the original plan, but the Communist Party insisted on discussing it by the Consultative Conference. Zhang Qun, the government representative of the three-person committee, reported on the negotiation process and proposed the establishment of a small committee to study the reorganization of the Communist army. Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party, also reported on the negotiation situation. He opposed Zhang Qun's proposal, believing that the reorganization of the Communist army should be considered by the Political Consultative Conference. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie strongly urged Zhou to accept Zhang Qun's proposal. Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, supported the government's plan, suggesting that the Political Consultative Conference draft a broad outline, and that the reorganization measures be implemented by a separate small committee. Zhou Enlai then proposed that the meeting should study all army reorganization issues.</p>

<p>[Our Peiping Office, 11th Dispatch] The 71st Army has landed in Qinhuangdao.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] The US military headquarters announced yesterday that the work of US ships transporting the New Sixth Army from Shanghai to the Northeast will begin on the 16th of this month. The New Sixth Army's cold-proof equipment has been prepared and they have been vaccinated. As for the detailed method of military transportation, our government and the US military authorities have also negotiated properly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 11th Dispatch] According to the Central News Agency, General Du Yuming is scheduled to take over five cities in the Northeast on the 15th, namely Shenyang, Fushun, Liaoyang, Benxi, and Anshan. Fushun is a coal-producing area 34 miles east of Shenyang. Liaoyang is a railway station 40 miles southwest of Shenyang. Benxi is a coal-producing area 37 miles southeast of Shenyang. Anshan is a steel-producing area 50 miles southwest of Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th Dispatch] Our army is scheduled to advance from Xinmin at noon on the 11th and can enter Shenyang on the 15th. [United Press, Tianjin, 11th Dispatch] It was reported here today from Yingkou that the National Army that entered Yingkou two days ago was fiercely resisted by the Communist Army yesterday. As a result, more than 100 people were killed or injured. The Chinese side did not disclose the number of resisting Communist troops. According to another report, the Soviet army is transporting a large number of military supplies to Dalian. Most of the railway vehicles full of machinery and spoils of war are heading north from Shenyang. General Du Yuming's troops hope to be stationed there on the 15th of this month, but no follow-up reports have been received from Shenyang regarding the agreement between the Soviet Union and the National Army to take over Shenyang on the 15th. Most of General Du's troops have advanced north from the Jinzhou headquarters and are waiting for orders to set off in Xinmin, which is close to Shenyang. It is reported that part of the army has entered the periphery of Shenyang.</p>
<p>Changchun Has Not Yet Been Taken Over; National Army in Rehe Province Advances</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Office, 10th Dispatch] Although the Northeast Security Force has been airlifted to Changchun, the defense of the area is still under the responsibility of the Soviet army. The Security Force is currently staying quietly in the barracks and has not yet implemented the takeover. The reporter learned from reliable sources that Changchun is still a besieged city surrounded by the Communist Army. There are about 1,000 Communist troops who have infiltrated into Changchun's underground work. There are 10,000 people within 20 miles of Changchun, and 20,000 people outside 20 to 40 miles of Changchun. The Communist Army in the Jilin and Changchun area has been designated as the Jichang Military Region, with Huang Hengyang as the commander, and three detachments under its jurisdiction. Zhang Qinghe, the commander of the first detachment, was the former director of the Changchun Public Security Bureau and is responsible for surrounding Changchun.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Office, 10th Dispatch] The troops under General Du Yuming are advancing towards Chengde at a speed as if entering an uninhabited area. According to the latest information yesterday, the National Army has advanced west to an area six miles away from Yebaishou. If the Communist Army still collapses at the first blow as in the past, it will only take about a week for Chairman Liu Duoquan to enter Chengde. The officials of the Rehe Provincial Government have advanced to Fuxin. Chairman Liu believes that the National Army is advancing rapidly and political work needs to be carried out urgently. He has telegraphed the officials of the Rehe Provincial Government in Peiping to rush to Jinzhou and head to Rehe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th Dispatch] The fifth batch of airlifted troops arrived in Changchun by ten planes at noon on the 10th. Also, a company of our security team arrived in Harbin from Changchun on the 9th.</p>
<h3>No News of the Takeover of Andong; The Mayor of Dalian Can Go to Take Office; Mo Dehui Admonishes the Staff of the Harbin Municipal Government</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Office, 10th Dispatch] The situation in the Northeast is developing forward in a delicate manner. Following Chiang Ching-kuo's trip to the Soviet Union as Chairman Chiang's personal representative, it is rumored here that Madame Chiang will come to Changchun, the nerve center of the Northeast, as the Chairman's wife. This news is not groundless. Compared with the trip to Dihua in the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Madame Chiang's trip seems to have more significant meaning. On the one hand, it symbolizes the friendly trend between China and the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, it shows Chairman Chiang's concern for the Northeast. Looking at the Northeast at this time, it is boundless wind and snow. Madame Chiang's trip should bring immeasurable harmony and warmth to the relationship between China and the Soviet Union in the Northeast, and between the central government and the local government. There is also news in the newspaper that President Song will go to the Northeast to inspect, but this seems to be premature. Admiral Shen Honglie quietly flew here and then flew silently to the Northeast. This old general, who once brought many books to negotiate the first Sino-Soviet treaty and was absent for the second time, is now making another appearance in the extremely delicate and complex situation in the Northeast. It is said that he will help Zhang Jia'ao to deal with some political and economic issues. As of today, it seems that Chiang Ching-kuo is still on his way back to the country. Director Xiong also said that he did not know what the gains of this trip were. There is no news about Andong. This corridor area bordering North Korea and facing the Yalu River will become a powder keg in the Northeast unless a full understanding is reached internationally and a satisfactory result is achieved at the domestic Political Consultative Conference. It is said that the takeover personnel can go to Dalian. In the future, Chairman Gao Xibing of Andong and Mayor Shen Yi of Dalian may have to take a train to take office.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 10th Dispatch] Mo Dehui and the chairmen of the Songjiang and Nenjiang provinces' receiving committees arrived in Harbin by special train at 2:00 p.m. on the 9th. Kazakov, the Soviet city defense commander, Qiu Fuliaofu, the director of the Changchun Railway Bureau, Wang Zhuting, the deputy director, Yang Chao'an, the mayor, and the heads of various agencies and representatives from all walks of life welcomed them at the station. At 10:00 a.m. on the 10th, Mo Dehui went to the city government to admonish all the staff, and at 2:00 p.m., he visited the Soviet city defense commander, and at 3:00 p.m., he admonished the police.</p>
<h3>The Ratio of Northeastern Circulation Vouchers to Legal Tender is Unofficially 1:13</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th Dispatch] Although the exchange rate between the Northeastern Nine Provinces circulation vouchers and legal tender has not yet been officially stipulated, the unofficial price in the local financial market is about 1:13. Banks here have now begun to accept and exchange legal tender according to this exchange rate, and can also handle small remittances between Guan Nei and Guan Wai (inside and outside the Great Wall) according to this exchange rate, but this remittance has not yet begun. This exchange rate will be naturally formed by the prices of goods and transportation conditions between Guan Nei and Guan Wai. After the transportation between Guan Nei and Guan Wai is restored and prices are stabilized, it is possible to fluctuate at any time.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Reports on Negotiation Process: If Communist Troops Are Not Reorganized, Cessation of Conflict Is Not Truly Complete</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] On the second day of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Zhang Qun reported on the negotiation process of ceasing military conflict and restoring transportation as follows: Today, the chairman designated me to report on the negotiation process of ceasing military conflict and restoring transportation. The reasons for the military conflict and the obstruction of transportation are not within the scope of my report today.</p>
<p>Regarding the negotiation process, it can be divided into two periods: First, the period of negotiations between the government representatives and the CCP representatives. Since the government representatives proposed measures to avoid conflict and restore transportation to the CCP representatives on October 2nd of last year, after several weeks of negotiation and several weeks of stagnation, the CCP proposed three measures on December 27th of last year, advocating unconditional cessation of conflict before discussing everything else. On the 31st, the government side put forward a concrete plan, stating that the cessation of domestic military conflict has always been the government's consistent position. To achieve this goal, there must be a practical agreement on measures, otherwise, the agreement on the cessation of conflict will be difficult to implement effectively. Therefore, the government put forward three measures: (1) Cease all military conflicts throughout the country and restore railway transportation. (2) Because domestic military conflicts and traffic jams are related to our country's obligations to the Allied countries regarding the surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners, the government will send one representative and the CCP will send one representative, together with General Marshall, to promptly agree on measures to be submitted to the government for implementation regarding the cessation of military conflict, restoration of railway transportation, and other matters related to surrender. (3) The resident committee of the Senate will appoint five impartial people to form a military inspection team to go to the conflict areas to investigate the military situation, traffic conditions, and other matters related to domestic peace restoration, and submit reports to the public at any time. When the Political Consultative Conference is established, please also appoint impartial people to participate.</p>
<p>Compared with the previous proposals, this method has one characteristic: it combines the problem of the US military assisting the China war zone in China in handling the surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners with the cessation of military conflict and the restoration of transportation, to achieve a comprehensive solution. Because if the conflict does not stop and transportation does not resume, the problem of surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners cannot be handled. Other delays and losses are even more incalculable. The CCP representatives generally agreed with this method. After two more negotiations, on the 5th of this month, a unanimous agreement was reached and the following decisions were made. Measures for ceasing conflict and restoring transportation: (1) Cease all military conflicts throughout the country and restore all transportation. The order to cease conflict and restore transportation shall be agreed upon in accordance with the provisions of Article 2. (2) Because domestic military conflicts and traffic jams are related to our country's obligations to the Allied countries regarding the surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners, the government and the CCP shall each send one representative, together with General Marshall, to promptly agree on measures to be submitted to the government for implementation. (3) The resident committee of the Senate and the Political Consultative Conference will each appoint eight impartial people other than the KMT and CCP parties to form a military inspection team. Together with representatives from both the KMT and CCP, they will go to the conflict areas throughout the country to inspect the military situation, traffic conditions, and other matters related to the restoration of domestic peace, and submit reports to the public at any time. The above is the period of negotiations between the government representatives and the CCP representatives.</p>
<p>Second, the period of consultations among the government representatives, the CCP representatives, and General Marshall. This consultation is called the "Three-Person Meeting." From the 7th of this month to the day before the opening of this conference, a total of six meetings were held. The main points of the document. This statement is not only of concern to all of you gentlemen at this conference, but also to compatriots throughout the country, and friendly countries in the international community are also concerned. You gentlemen must have already read the above records, so I won't say much more today. The government has already issued an order yesterday, and in accordance with the time limit agreed with the CCP representatives, it will be implemented uniformly before 12:00 pm on the 13th of this month, regardless of location. Naturally, it is based on the measures agreed upon by the government representatives and the CCP representatives on the 5th. The achievements of this conference can be seen in the statement jointly issued by me and Mr. Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, yesterday morning. A total of four documents were signed: (1) Draft of the order to cease conflict, (2) Matters of Understanding (the above two documents were signed jointly by the three people) (3) Military Mediation Executive Department, (4) Joint Statement (these two documents were signed by representatives of both the government and the CCP).</p>
<p>The content of the joint statement includes: (1) (2) (3) three</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Department, the announcement only contains the main points, and I will now supplement a few points: (1) The Military Mediation Executive Department was established to facilitate the implementation of the cessation of conflict and the restoration of transportation, and to smoothly complete the tasks of disarming the enemy and repatriating enemy prisoners. Its tasks are clearly defined. (2) The Military Mediation Executive Department will have three members. The United States has appointed Chargé d'Affaires Robertson, the government has appointed Zheng Tingwei Jie Min from the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the CCP has appointed Chief of Staff Ye Jianying. They can go to Beiping the day after tomorrow to start work. (3) For the operating procedures of the Military Mediation Executive Department, each of the three members has one vote, and all matters must be unanimously approved by the three people. Necessary orders are issued downward in the name of the Chairman of the National Government, and reports are submitted upward by the affiliated executive group, which are prepared daily and sent by each member to their respective leaders. (4) The work of the Military Mediation Executive Department is promoted by the executive group. The director of the executive group is a US military officer who supervises the relevant troops and has the power to issue and convey all orders and instructions. Necessary locations may also set up branch stations or dispatch monitoring or reporting teams. (5) The Military Mediation Executive Department will continue to exist and carry out its work until the government or the CCP notifies its abolition.</p>
<p>The above points were not mentioned in the announcement. In order to let everyone understand the whole picture, I will make a special supplementary report. During the Three-Person Meeting, everyone had a spirit of mutual understanding and concession, and all negotiations proceeded smoothly. The government is now proposing the following three items that are not subject to the restrictions of the cessation of conflict measures and must be treated as exceptions: The first item is about military reorganization, the second item is about receiving the northeastern provinces, and the third item is about receiving Chifeng and Duolun. Agreement was reached on the first two items, but the third item was strongly opposed by the CCP representatives, so a final decision could not be reached at the afternoon meeting on the 9th. The government sincerely hopes that this meeting will be successful and that the order to cease conflict can be announced before the Political Consultative Conference, so it made a final concession and incorporated this proposal into the Rehe-Chahar issue for a comprehensive solution. It is not treated as an exception when this agreement to cease conflict is established. When the meeting on the 9th did not yield results, there was speculation outside that the government had made some new proposals, which led to the occurrence of twists and turns, and this was the reason for it. After the Three-Person Meeting passed all the proposals, I suggested that, based on the Three-Person Small Group previously clearly defined by the government representatives and the CCP representatives, it should be established immediately to carry out the reorganization of the CCP's troops. Because military conflict between the two sides is an unfortunate thing, it is a good thing that the Three-Person Meeting has negotiated a cessation of measures to turn hostility into harmony, but the cessation of conflict has not truly resolved the problem. After the order to cease conflict is issued, the Three-Person Small Group can be quickly established, and concrete implementation measures can be re-negotiated and implemented regarding the reorganization of the CCP troops and the regulations for their stationing. That would be considered a true solution to the problem. In other words, it means that the organization and measures currently established to implement the order to cease conflict will no longer exist, and that will be considered the true completion of our mission to cease conflict. At that time, General Marshall expressed that he considered it important and was willing to use all the work of the Three-Person Meeting to urgently suggest that the Three-Person Small Group should proceed as soon as possible. Mr. Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, still had no objection. Today, I would like to conclude my report with this, because during the effective implementation period of the order to cease conflict, if the issue of the reorganization and stationing of the CCP troops is not resolved quickly, neither the demobilization, reorganization, and rehabilitation of the military, nor the political and economic construction can proceed smoothly, and the burden and suffering of the people on all sides cannot be alleviated. You gentlemen are extremely concerned about this issue and should be reported in detail, but all the situations and related documents have been published, and today I am limited by time, so I can only make a brief report, and I ask you gentlemen for your forgiveness.</p>

<h3>Second Day of the United Nations General Assembly: Selection of Committee Members Determined; US, Soviet Union, UK, China, and France Elected as Vice Presidents of the General Assembly; Non-Permanent Members of the Security Council Also Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] Today is the second day of the United Nations General Assembly. According to reliable sources, the internal distribution of power has been decided. The US, Soviet Union, UK, China, and France will each receive a seat as Vice President of the General Assembly. The remaining two vice president seats are internally designated for India and Venezuela. The chairmen of the various committees have also been internally designated as follows: The Chairman of the Political and Security Committee belongs to Ukraine, the Chairman of the Economic Committee belongs to Holland, the Chairman of the Social Welfare Committee belongs to New Zealand, the Chairman of the Trusteeship Committee belongs to Uruguay, the Chairman of the Administrative Committee belongs to Syria, and the Chairman of the Legal Committee belongs to Panama. The Security Council has the greatest power, and the future international police will be under its command. In addition to the US, Soviet Union, UK, China, and France as permanent members, the remaining six seats will probably be decided by tomorrow. The British Commonwealth can obtain one seat on the Council, and Canada and Australia are competing fiercely. The remaining five seats will probably belong to Colombia and Mexico, as representatives of South America and Central America, Belgium representing Western Europe, Poland representing Eastern Europe, and Egypt representing the Middle East. Regarding the candidates for Secretary-General of the General Assembly, it is heard that the five major powers will hold a meeting tonight to decide. The US and Britain favor Canadian Ambassador to the US Pearson, while the Soviet Union favors Yugoslav Ambassador to the US Šumik. A final decision will probably be made after Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky arrives.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] UN General Assembly President Spaak this morning requested the Assembly to establish a temporary committee to investigate the amendment proposed by Cuba and decide whether or not to adopt it. The motion proposes the establishment of a committee with fifty-one members, with one member from each delegation, whose work would be strictly limited. It is widely believed that the purpose of this motion is to avoid the establishment of a general small committee with only fourteen members, which could potentially make important political decisions. After delivering his opening remarks, Spaak also requested the Assembly to allow the Executive Secretary and his staff to carry out the work of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat of the Assembly until a formal Secretary-General is appointed. This motion was unopposed and was therefore passed. In addition, the Colombian representative was asked to present the report of the Preparatory Committee.</p>
<p>Spaak's Opening Remarks: Said That Promoting the Interests of All Countries Is Necessary to Eliminate Differences</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The United Nations General Assembly held its second day of meetings today. At the opening of the meeting, Spaak stood up to address the meeting and expressed his gratitude for being elected as the President of the Assembly. Mr. Shi spoke in French in a sonorous and forceful tone, which lasted for twelve minutes. The whole room was filled with cheers. The main points of Mr. Shi's speech were: The great task of the United Nations Organization, if it is to be successful, requires an international spirit. Mr. Shi's speech began by saying: He felt satisfied with his election, but also had a sense of regret. Because his friend Lei Yi, the Norwegian Foreign Minister who represents the heroic people of Norway, was not elected. He fully understood the meaning of choosing Lei Yi as a candidate for President. And he felt the same way as the representatives who voted in favor of him. Mr. Shi then welcomed all the representatives in his capacity as President, and paid special tribute to Mrs. Roosevelt, calling it the most glorious and respected name. The death of the great man, President Roosevelt, was mourned by everyone. The whole audience cheered in unison. Mr. Shi continued: "I feel the same way about the remarks made yesterday about Lei Yi and the heroic people of Norway. I am deeply grateful for your vote of confidence. I would also like to explain that those who voted for Lei Yi wanted to praise him and his country. I understand this very well. I now look around and see many representatives who are dedicated to peace, far better than me, and more qualified than me to receive this honor, which makes me feel ashamed." At this point, Mr. Shi wished to say a few words about the start of the conference, saying: The world has had this kind of test, and this is not the first time. But the first test, unfortunately, was not successful. This may not need to be repeated, but the lessons of the past can ultimately enlighten the future. During the period between the two world wars, we failed to form an international spirit. In order for our work to succeed, an international spirit is necessary. In a conference such as the United Nations Organization, we must make great efforts to eliminate differences. Our task is to promote the interests of all countries, but this interest must be expanded into a general interest before we can succeed.</p>
<p>During the Election of the President, the Oval Office Temporarily Recommended the Norwegian Foreign Minister, But the Belgian Foreign Minister Was Still Elected</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Representatives of fifty-one countries began working together at 4:00 PM yesterday (12:00 AM Shanghai time) to establish a "safe and free world built on justice and humanitarianism." Dr. Chu Laite, representative of Colombia and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, slowly rose from his crimson seat in the crowded Central Hall of London on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the first League of Nations, and opened the prelude to the second conference to establish lasting peace. The privilege of presiding over the opening of the conference was obtained by a representative of a small South American republic, which shows that all members of the United Nations Organization enjoy sovereign equality. The venue was silent, and the representatives were sitting upright. Then, British Prime Minister Attlee stood up to thank the temporary chairman and welcome politicians from all over the world. Prime Minister Attlee also gave the conference the motto he had previously announced in Geneva: "Peace is indivisible." (For the full text of Attlee's speech, see the relevant column in the upper right corner of this edition.) The most tense situation yesterday was during the election of the President after Prime Minister Attlee's speech. It was expected before the meeting that the whole room could unanimously elect Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak as President, but Soviet representative Gromyko suddenly moved to elect Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie as President. The delegations of Ukraine, Denmark, and Poland also seconded the motion. Regarding the voting method, fifteen delegations favored secret, nine delegations favored public, and twenty-seven delegations abstained. This matter was so unexpected that people did not know what to decide. Therefore, so many people abstained. As a result, it was decided to vote secretly. When the ballots were counted, it was announced that Spaak was elected as President with 28 votes against 23 votes. Cheers immediately rose, and Spaak ascended the podium to thank all the representatives and temporary Chairman Chu Laite, and announced that he would deliver his official inaugural speech today. At the same time, he officially announced the convening of the first meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations Organization.</p>
<h3>Our Representative's Attitude Towards the United Nations Organization: Constructive Rather Than Critical; We Can Make Concessions in Anything That Helps the Organization</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] A senior Chinese official told United Press today, "China's cooperation with international organizations is still in its early stages. If it can help the work of the new organization, China is willing to make slight concessions in certain aspects." He pointed out that China's attitude towards the United Nations Organization is "constructive rather than critical." The official said: China has no special opinions on the selection of the executive organ of the United Nations Organization, but he hopes that China can participate in it. When asked for his opinion on the trusteeship system, he said: This system must have a time limit, after which these countries should be returned to their respective peoples.</p>
<h3>Egypt Occupies a Seat on the Security Council and Trusteeship Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] As representatives of 51 countries to the United Nations General Assembly conduct their meetings, it appears certain that Egypt will be elected as a member of the United Nations Organization's Security Council and Trusteeship Council. United Press has learned from reliable sources that Egypt can obtain extensive assistance and sit on the Security Council alongside the five powers of the US, China, Soviet Union, UK, and France, as well as five other countries. The direct work of the council is to consider all possible ways to prevent the disruption of peace when major crises occur anywhere in the world. According to the Egyptian representative, Security Council membership will be based on geographical distribution. Egypt can participate in the Security Council for two main reasons: First, Egypt enjoys treaty relations with Britain and other countries, and as a key point of Britain's transportation lines, it seems like a naturally suitable member. Second, Egypt has been recognized as the leader of the Arab countries, and therefore can be supported by the countries of the Arab League, including Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, all of which are members of the United Nations General Assembly. There is a natural sympathy between Ethiopia and the Arab countries, so observers believe that Ethiopia will also support Egypt. Moreover, Egypt played an important role in the debates of the Preparatory Committee. The Middle East is a sensitive part of the world in the relations between countries, so the Arab countries are determined to have a voice in the Council that decides future policies. Britain has proposed that the responsibility for resolving the Middle East issue be handed over to the United Nations Organization. Informed sources believe that this is another argument to strengthen the representation of Arab countries. The issue of Ibon's relations with the Soviet Union, the issue between the Near East and France, Egypt's demands on Britain to revise the 1936 treaty, and the issue of greater administrative power over Sudan, are all sufficient to allow Arab countries to seek a stronger voice. Britain has decided to hand over its issues to the United Nations Organization, so the Arab countries believe that they must obtain representation on the Trusteeship Council.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Praises the United Nations Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 10th] Moscow Radio broadcast said: "The first plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly opened under favorable conditions after the foreign ministers of the three powers reiterated cooperation among the three countries. The General Assembly should make a concrete contribution to laying a just and lasting peace."</p>
<h3>Indian Chief Representative Concerned About the Trusteeship Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, the chief representative of India to the United Nations General Assembly, told reporters today, "The Indian delegation is extremely concerned about the Trusteeship Committee, because the future of the countries under mandate in the future, especially those in the southeastern region of India, is of vital interest to us. The establishment of the Trusteeship Council will still take some time. It cannot be established until the General Assembly invites the countries that previously held mandates in the League of Nations and the directly related states to conclude a harmonious agreement. This agreement was first reviewed by the Trusteeship Committee and then submitted to the General Assembly." When asked by reporters whether India should occupy a seat on the Trusteeship Committee, Sir said, "India's participation is a must." Sir served as Chairman of the Social and Economic Committee at the Preparatory Assembly and the San Francisco Conference. When reporters inquired whether there was a possibility of continuing to serve as Chairman of the committee at the General Assembly, Sir did not discuss it, but believed that the work of the committee would take three years to complete. It is also understood that the Security Council and other committees must change chairmen at each session, but the Chairman of the Social and Economic Committee serves a one-year term, and one of its tasks is to convene an international trade conference this summer.</p>
<h3>Complete Text of Attlee's Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] The United Nations General Assembly opened on the 10th at Central Hall, Westminster, London. British Prime Minister Attlee delivered the opening speech last night (Shanghai time, 1:30 AM yesterday morning). The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>I am greatly honored to welcome the representatives of the United Nations to London. First, I must thank Mr. Sheng for his speech. As Chairman of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations, he shouldered a difficult mission and achieved today's success. We are all deeply impressed. I learned from my colleagues that the Preparatory Commission was fortunate to have Mr. Sheng's guidance. Without his talent, sense of responsibility, and guidance to his colleagues, we might not have a draft for the General Assembly to discuss today.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that this General Assembly will have the same spirit of diligence, practicality, and cooperation as the Preparatory Commission. In the Preparatory Commission, although major issues were debated frankly and intensely, a spirit of coordination and goodwill also existed, so the results were able to converge.</p>
<p>Since we welcome you to London, we will do our best to make you feel at home in our capital and express your opinions freely and frankly, as if you were gathered on a special territory under international co-management. We will, within the possible range, make your stay in England pleasant and comfortable. If there is any inadequacy in our hospitality, we hope that you will understand that this ancient city is experiencing shortages due to enemy ravages. It is by no means due to our lack of sincerity. What you see around you is proof of this.</p>
<p>Last night, His Majesty the King, representing the British Commonwealth, mentioned in his short and moving speech the nature of the tasks we must accomplish. The current situation is grave, and each member of the British Commonwealth is eager to see the initial success of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The United Nations Charter originated from the San Francisco Conference, which I also attended. When the conference was initiated, the enemy was still at war, and the conference symbolized confidence in victory and a reaffirmation of the war aims. The preamble and Article 1 of the Charter state the aims and principles of the conference, which are wholeheartedly supported by His Majesty's Government and unanimously trusted by the people of this country, regardless of party affiliation.</p>
<p>In my lifetime, war has twice brought indescribable sorrow to mankind. If a third war were to occur, the progress of civilization would inevitably stagnate, and the centuries of human effort would be destroyed. The preamble to the United Nations Charter expresses lofty ideals, for which countless men and women have given their lives in war. Defining principles is not difficult, but turning ideals into reality is not easy.</p>
<p>People are easily motivated to realize ideals when stirred by war. In the summer of 1920, when this country faced the threat of invasion, the entire nation rose up with one goal, and immediately took action. Men and women eagerly participated in the work, adapting to the needs of the time. This goal remained the same throughout the five years of war. During these five years, countries successively joined the war, and workers' groups in the rear cooperated, working together towards the goal of victory. In the process of cooperative and concerted efforts, the individual ambitions of each country disappeared imperceptibly.</p>
<p>Today, our weapons have been crowned with the laurels of victory. Our task is to quickly establish lasting peace. The spirit of selflessness and sacrifice that nations showed in times of trouble and war is still necessary today. We must fully recognize the importance of our mission and complete it together.</p>
<p>In the future, when deciding world diplomatic policy, the United Nations organization should be considered first. After the First World War, ordinary diplomatic policy always took [something] as a premise and overlooked the League of Nations. In the past, British nobles had armed retinues, but over time, they were gradually regulated by the government, and private armies eventually disappeared. The same principle should apply to the world's armed forces, which should all be subject to restraint. We must recognize the indivisibility of peace, as declared by the Soviet Foreign Minister in Geneva. The aggression launched by Japan in the Far East and the aggressive actions of Italian fascists were not properly addressed, resulting in the tearing up of laws. The five years of Nazi aggression dragged the entire world into a vortex of war. Today, our happiness is more interconnected than ever before. The United Nations Charter includes the simple basic needs of individuals and recognizes that individual freedom within a country is an appendage to the freedom of nations in the United Nations.</p>
<p>I have stated that establishing peace and preventing war is an unprecedentedly urgent task. In the past, our country had the ocean as a barrier, allowing us to live in peace. Today, it is easier to understand that we have entered a new era. Powerful weapons and the destruction wrought over long distances have dispelled our illusion of living in a secluded and safe haven. We have received many warnings. The emergence of the atomic bomb can be said to be the last warning. If its destructive power is uncontrolled, the highest civilization of mankind will face the calamity of complete destruction.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have decided to entrust the entire issue of atomic energy control to the United Nations organization. This is the major problem facing the world today. The representatives of all countries must make a choice between life and death. I deeply hope and believe that the representatives present here today have come to England not only with determination but also with hope. Those who are skeptical and pessimistic will always have war. If the League of Nations failed in this way, how can there be hope for the United Nations organization?" They do not know that the progress of civilization is a chain of failures and lessons learned. The labor movement is a history of failures. After each failure, skeptics say: "The workers' stubborn interests are too strong, and they cannot unite." As a result, the workers united.</p>
<p>I have strong confidence in the success of the United Nations organization. We have learned a lot from past mistakes. The old League of Nations failed because it was incompetent, mainly because the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union did not participate during its formation.</p>
<p>Today, the countries of the world are more united than ever before, and the new organization's charter stipulates the use of force to guarantee its laws.</p>
<p>I believe that the common people of all countries in the world must also recognize the crisis facing the world today. To make the United Nations organization a living reality rather than an ideal, we should not only obtain the support of governments but also the support of people all over the world.</p>
<p>Our goal is to achieve a world free from fear and poverty. Economic insecurity is more lasting than the terror of war. Without social security, there is no foundation for peace. Therefore, economic and security work in the conference should have international power. In addition, an international police force is also necessary, but the safer and more satisfied the people of the world feel, the less need there will be for police.</p>
<p>For individuals, economic insecurity is a more lasting and significant shadow than war. Everyone should understand that everything discussed in this conference concerns everyone and will affect everyone's families and lives.</p>
<p>Finally, we may as well examine what peace really is. Peace is the absence of war, the establishment of a safe and free world. And this world is governed by justice and moral laws, with authority restraining power and public good overcoming private desires. We can gather here today in this home of free laws, all because brave men and women suffered or died. We are able to live. We must always remember this great sacrifice and inherit the achievements of the martyrs with courage, patience, and a spirit of sacrifice. We must succeed, and we will surely succeed.</p>

Royall also said that the Department of the Army is reviewing the entire demobilization situation and will soon formulate a detailed plan.

<h3>Truman Considered Establishing a Federation of European Countries, But Believes It Should Not Be Identical to the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] American political commentator Kreyer recently wrote in "Collier's" magazine that President Truman has considered whether European countries could form a federation, believing that this federation is essential for stability, peace, and prosperity. The president's intention is not to require the European federal organization to be completely identical to the United States, but it must use the same currency, conclude a customs union, jointly develop natural resources, and use waterways. The reason why the president considered forming a federation of European countries was to solve the following two major problems: (1) How can the U.S. government effectively assist Europe's recovery until Europe can make good use of the assistance it receives? (2) Europe has tariffs and trade restrictions, and the currency system is chaotic, making transactions impossible and isolating urban industrial areas from rural areas. Under these circumstances, what real hope is there for Europe's recovery? For example, Norway needs salt produced in Italy, and Italy needs fish produced in Norway. The German mining areas produce a lot of coal, while Denmark, Hungary, and the Netherlands are rich in food, and can exchange food for German coal. However, due to the current trade barriers, it is impossible to exchange goods with each other. If European countries eliminate their fears and hatreds and treat each other like family, they will inevitably expand their military preparations in the future. If countries do not stop using their resources for military buildup, the living standards of the people will not be improved. The President believes that if the United States unfortunately adopts the current policies of European countries or becomes as divided as Europe, the United States will fall into chaos. The late French politician Briand and former British Prime Minister Churchill both advocated that Europe should be integrated, and those who opposed this plan were only arms dealers and nationalist politicians. Switzerland can be regarded as a "miniature of the European Federation," with all its twenty-two cantons united into a federal nation. The European Federation advocated by Americans will not include Britain and the Soviet Union, because including the Soviet Union would be tantamount to extending the scope of Europe to the Pacific region. Soviet power will unbalance the European Federation. After the European Federation is formed, there can be several benefits, because under this system, countries will have no imperialist ambitions, and the Soviet Union can no longer worry about the emergence of a "Western bloc," and devote all its efforts to developing its own resources. Britain can take the opportunity to focus on solving its own problems, and the United States can also generate a belief that the money currently used in Europe will lay a solid foundation for Europe.</p>
<h3>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Arrives in Bulgaria to Discuss Cabinet Reorganization</h3>

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Large Number of Flour Merchants Arrested</p>
<p>Recently, the price of flour in Suzhou has been rising steadily, which has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. The reason for this is that flour merchants have been operating a "flour tea party" at the Guanyuan Street, Yuanmiao Guan, and East Corner Gate of the Dadong Tea House. There are often more than two hundred people from the flour industry and other trades that engage in short selling and manipulation of the market. This matter was discovered by the military and police authorities. On the morning of the tenth, at 11 o'clock, military organs, together with the police bureau, dispatched personnel to arrest fifty or sixty people from both the flour industry and other trades who were engaged in the tea party transactions, and severely punished them. At the same time, the tea house was notified that it would no longer be allowed to hold such events.</p>

<h3>United Nations General Assembly Highlights</h3>
<p>Osmanthus Leaves Symbolize Peace, Arab Delegates' Distinctive Attire</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] On the second day of the United Nations General Assembly today, the fifty-one United Nations delegates braved the drizzling rain and hurriedly walked along the sidewalk, where crowds cheered yesterday but which was rather quiet today, to enter the Central Hall of Westminster and listen to the formal speech of the first Secretary-General of the Assembly, Spaak (Belgian Foreign Minister). The public seats in the hall, which were packed yesterday, had some empty seats today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Yesterday, the magnificent gold and blue Central Hall was filled with 350 delegates. The most notable absentee was the Soviet chief delegate and Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vyshinsky. He had not yet completed his mission in Romania and could not arrive in time. The hall was brightly lit with electric lights. The most striking decoration was a huge world map, representing the United Nations emblem, surrounded by osmanthus leaves, symbolizing peace. Below the huge map was the podium, with a light-colored long table and two loudspeakers. Dr. Chu Lai-Tai, the temporary chairman, sat on it. In front of the podium was the speaker's stand, also with two loudspeakers. At the chairman's request, each speaker spoke from there. Directly opposite the podium were the seats of the delegates from South Africa, Turkey, and Syria. To their left were the delegates from Saudi Arabia. The five delegates were dressed in brown Arab robes and white silk headscarves, which were the most distinctive attire among the delegates from various countries. The delegates from the three great powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, formed a triangle on the right side of the hall. When the temporary chairman, Dr. Chu Lai-Tai, stood up to speak, the entire hall fell silent. The doctor spoke in somewhat unnatural French, which was quickly translated into English.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The Soviet delegation nominated Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie as president because Norway was the first victim of German aggression, the Norwegians were staunch fighters for democracy, and Lie was an experienced politician. In 1940, when the German army invaded Norway, Lie was the last of the Norwegian ministers to escape from Oslo to London. Lie, 49, is a lawyer by profession, tall and athletic, and was defeated in a secret vote at the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Spaak served as prime minister for nine months, the youngest of the prime ministers in Europe, and is known for this. Spaak is physically strong. He was the first female senator in Belgium. In May 1938, she became Belgium's first socialist prime minister. In September 1939, she became foreign minister. When Belgium was invaded, she narrowly escaped capture by the German army. Although she eventually escaped with other members of the Belgian government to London, her family had to be abandoned in Belgium.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of Army Says Before Leaving Japan That the Japanese Emperor Need Not Abdicate, US Troops to Be Reduced to 400,000 by May</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] US Secretary of the Army Patterson has completed his inspection here and departed for China and the Philippines. Today, before his departure, he told Japanese reporters that Emperor Hirohito need not abdicate for his war responsibilities and that this matter should be decided by the Japanese people themselves. The entire question of the Japanese imperial family is covered by the Potsdam Agreement. Patterson greatly praised MacArthur and the occupying forces. He also said that the number of American troops in the Pacific could be reduced to 400,000 by May. He said he had not heard of any requests from the Soviet Union or China to send occupying forces to Japan. Patterson did not admit that there were any problems with the implementation of the demobilization plan. The Department of the Army had carefully planned the orderly demobilization. The number of demobilized personnel is also being accelerated compared to what was estimated last August and September, he said.</p>

<p>President Sun: The government plans to start by revising the Organic Law of the National Government, expanding the National Government Committee to serve as the highest policy guidance organ. The specific measures are: (1) Expanding the number of members of the National Government Committee. (2) Members of the National Government Committee may be appointed by the Chairman of the National Government upon nomination from outside the party.</p>
<p>Reporter: After the National Government Committee is expanded and reorganized in this way, what new provisions will be made regarding its powers?</p>
<p>President Sun: After the expansion and reorganization, the powers of the National Government Committee will be the same as those of the current Supreme National Defense Council, that is, the powers formerly exercised by the Central Political Conference. The matters discussed and decided by the National Government Committee will include the following six categories: [A] Legislative principles, [B] Administrative policies, [C] Military and political plans, [D] Financial plans and budgets, [E] Matters referred by the Chairman, [F] Suggestions jointly submitted by one-third or more of the committee members.</p>
<p>Reporter: After the National Government Committee decides on the above matters, will they be immediately implemented?</p>
<p>President Sun: The decisions should be implemented, but if the Chairman of the National Government believes that it is difficult to implement the decisions of the National Government Committee, he may submit them for reconsideration. If two-thirds or more of the committee members insist on maintaining the original proposal, the decisions should be implemented.</p>
<p>Reporter: According to this provision, must all major national affairs be discussed and decided by the National Government Committee before they can be handled?</p>
<p>President Sun: If there are major domestic incidents or urgent foreign affairs that cannot wait for the National Government Committee to make a decision, the Chairman of the National Government may take expedient measures and then report to the National Government Committee. After expansion and reorganization, the National Government Committee will be the highest political organ in the national system. In Nanjing, there was a period when the National Government Committee meeting was the highest organ of the government.</p>
<p>Reporter: After the National Government is expanded and reorganized, will the organization of the Executive Yuan undergo considerable changes?</p>
<p>President Sun: The government proposes that the Executive Yuan should appoint several political affairs ministers who may also serve as ministers of various departments.</p>
<p>Reporter: Will the May 5th Draft Constitution be revised in this two-week Political Consultative Conference?</p>
<p>President Sun: The government proposes to appoint experts to form a committee to collect, organize, and submit the opinions from all parties for adoption by the National Assembly. However, the principles of the May 5th Draft Constitution may be discussed by the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>Reporter: The government has announced that the National Assembly will be convened on May 5th of this year. Will the date be changed?</p>
<p>President Sun: The National Assembly to be convened on May 5th of this year is a constitutional assembly. The government originally planned to convene it in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], but the war of resistance broke out and the government moved westward, so it had to be postponed. Therefore, the government believes that the constitutional National Assembly should not be postponed again.</p>
<p>Reporter: Regarding the representatives of the National Assembly, some outside parties have proposed re-election. What is the government's opinion?</p>
<p>President Sun: The elected representatives were originally elected based on the Organic Law of the National Assembly and the Election Law promulgated by the government. These laws only stipulate that the representatives are responsible for drafting the constitution and deciding the date of its implementation, and there is no provision for a term of office. This first National Assembly is not a National Assembly established in accordance with the constitution, but only has a task and no term of office. Therefore, the government cannot agree with the view that the original elected representatives are invalid and should be completely re-elected. A complete re-election would inevitably increase disputes. At the same time, it would not be possible to meet the deadline of convening the meeting on May 5th. The government's opinion is that, in addition to those who have already been elected, the remaining seats will be reasonably increased to give all parties and social figures ample opportunity to participate. After the completion of its task, this first National Assembly will be dissolved, and the second National Assembly will be organized through a national general election in accordance with the constitution within six months. The reporter ended the interview there and then, as President Sun had other matters to attend to.</p>
<p>Based on the Common Program, the Whole Country Cooperates in Unison</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai</p>
<p>At the opening of the Political Consultative Conference on the 10th, Zhou Enlai, a member of the conference, said: Such a Political Consultative Conference is an innovation in the political history of China. Especially in the transitional period when the whole country is unanimously demanding a swift end to political tutelage and actively preparing for constitutional government, this conference bears a serious historical mission. Our delegation from the Chinese Communist Party, based on this understanding, is willing to work with the representatives of all parties and social figures with the utmost sincerity and tolerance to discuss national affairs and work together.</p>
<p>When the delegation came to the capital this time, it first proposed an unconditional cessation of the civil war. After more than 20 days of appeals and efforts, with the joint efforts of government representatives, and especially with the support of our ally General Marshall, and finally thanks to President Chiang's vision and empathy, the civil war, which the whole world and the whole of China are concerned about, was ordered to be stopped by both sides today.</p>
<p>The cessation of military conflict is necessary for a good discussion of political solutions, and the political solution is to realize the policy of peaceful national construction. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have already recognized in the Double Tenth Agreement that they will cooperate in the long term on the basis of peace, democracy, unity, and under the leadership of President Chiang, firmly avoid civil war, and build an independent, free, and prosperous new China, and thoroughly realize the Three Principles of the People. Both sides also agreed that political democratization, nationalization of the military, and equality and legality of political parties are the necessary paths to achieving peaceful national construction. The Political Consultative Conference is to ask the representatives of all parties and social figures to work together to formulate a plan to achieve political democratization, nationalization of the military, and equality and legality of political parties. During this transitional period, we propose to realize a government of national unity in which representatives of all parties and non-party representatives cooperate on the basis of a common program. At this time, the rights of the people and the cooperation of political parties are the most urgent problems to be solved. Just now, we heard President Chiang's announcement on guaranteeing the four rights of the people, and we welcome this announcement and are willing to fight for the realization of these rights. With a situation of peace and unity and a foundation of democracy and unification, China can carry out genuine popular elections and democratic constitutionalism, and only then can there be genuine agricultural reform and industrial construction. We wish the Political Consultative Conference success.</p>
<p>The Urgent Task at Hand is to Complete Reconstruction and Relief</p>
<p>Shen Junru</p>
<p>At the opening of the Political Consultative Conference on the 10th, Shen Junru, a member of the conference, said: Today's opening of the Political Consultative Conference is not only a matter of concern to the people of the whole country, but also a matter of concern to people all over the world. First of all, on behalf of all the attending members of the China Democratic League, I would like to express our sincerity, frankness, impartiality, and selflessness to bear this great responsibility together with all the members. We believe that the current issues of reconstruction and relief are more urgent than the issues of drafting and implementing a constitution. We are willing to work with all the members to solve these problems first. Our China Democratic League emphasizes the following points in solving these problems: First, we must not violate the common aspirations of the people. Second, we must not betray the good intentions of our allies to help. Third, we must act with the utmost sincerity when implementing the plan and adhere to it with the utmost trust. Regarding the detailed methods for solving the above problems, we are willing to seek fair and reasonable results in the conference based on the principle of mutual concession.</p>
<p>Everyone Should Openly and Frankly Create a National Construction Line</p>
<p>Zeng Qi</p>
<p>At the Political Consultative Conference this morning, member Zeng Qi said: Today, at the opening of this conference, I would like to say a few words on behalf of my comrades in the China Youth Party. We hope to move to the stage of constitutional government through this and form a unified front for national construction, with the goal of becoming a modern country in name and in reality in thirty years. But to achieve this goal, we must have cooperation between the government and the opposition, with one heart and one mind, and work together in the same boat, using the spirit of "cooperating in the war of resistance" to cooperate in national construction. In particular, we must treat each other with sincerity. I want to put the country on the right track, and the only way to do this is to implement political democratization and nationalization of the military. In order to achieve this goal, we must all implement the sixteen characters of "openness and frankness, collective wisdom and benefit, examining facts according to names, and eliminating the turbid and promoting the pure." I would like to offer this to all the gentlemen at the conference. And I wish the conference a smooth success, fully achieving the goals of democracy, unity, peace, and national construction.</p>
<p>Willing to Use the Wheel as a Metaphor to Promote Its Forward Progress</p>
<p>Shao Congen</p>
<p>At the morning meeting of the Political Consultative Conference on the 10th, member Shao Congen said: Today, Congen is entrusted by the non-partisan and non-factional members to say a few words. Today is good, the front-line fighting has stopped, and both sides have shown patriotism. Based on this patriotism, we can have hope for the future of the country. We think about how this wrong path in the past could not be followed. Internally, it harmed the common people, and externally, our allies were worried for us, and our enemies were happy to see it. In the future, everyone must be "sincere" and "trustworthy." If one thing is on the inside and another on the outside, that is "insincerity." If it's one thing today and another tomorrow, that is "untrustworthiness." Secondly, all parties and factions must understand each other. There are political parties in foreign countries, and even many political parties, one of which must be conservative. Without a conservative political party, the foundation of the country will be shaken at any time. And there must be a progressive political party. Without a progressive political party, politics will degenerate day by day. These two kinds of political parties seem to be opposite, but they are complementary and mutually cause each other. They are like two wheels, going in the same direction, moving forward on a new road day by day. Looking back, China is also like this. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are like pillars, and the other parties are like beams. But today our pillars and beams have not become a very complete system. From the bottom of my heart, Congen sees the country above and the people below, and based on these three, I offer my opinions to serve the country. (Applause)</p>
<p>Yamashita Tomoyuki, More Cunning Than a Monkey</p>
<p>Yamashita Tomoyuki was sentenced to death by the Allied military court, which was well deserved. But Yamashita did not completely repent, and he is still studying the verdict with his defense lawyer in the hope of reversing his death sentence. At the same time, 86,000 out-of-touch Tokyo citizens have launched a petition movement seeking to spare Yamashita's death sentence, which is also a futile effort. The San Francisco Chronicle made a satirical comment, saying: "The three monkeys who do not speak evil, hear evil, or see evil will give way to Yamashita Tomoyuki!" This remark is very incisive and pungent. The illustration shows Yamashita and his defense lawyer studying the verdict.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Walk in Pengcheng (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Xuzhou's establishment as a municipality is a new undertaking since Japan's surrender. The first mayor, Lu Dongfan, arrived in mid-December to take office and held his inauguration ceremony on the 28th. He told reporters that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is studying the city's planning. Xuzhou may become a more substantial ordinary city in the future, but currently, two-thirds of its financial revenue is used to pay the salaries of the city's administrative staff, with only one-third allocated for local construction. While this is better than some special municipalities that are in deficit, the proportions still need to be normalized.</p>
<p>Xuzhou is bitterly cold at the end of the year, with snow fluttering on New Year's Day. Soldiers and civilians wear thick and bulky cotton-padded clothing, leisurely strolling through the market. This demonstrates their resilience against nature. Meanwhile, impoverished old people, with purple hands and cheeks, hover on the icy, glass-like pedestrian paths, begging pitifully. This is the street scene of Xuzhou, the northern gateway. The frequency of Japanese people coming and going on the streets is even greater than in Nanjing and Shanghai. When asked, responsible authorities said that there are only about 8,000 Japanese residents now, but they can still set up shops and engage in small businesses.</p>
<p>The female owner of a Japanese cafe said, "This is because the Garrison Command pities us and allows us to operate." When mentioning the crimes committed by the Japanese invaders in China, she said, "We really cannot be held responsible." She then refused to continue the conversation to avoid this sensitive reality. The reporter was puzzled about the meaning of "pity." Is it a euphemism for tolerance or a different interpretation of indulgence?</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Japanese Prisoner Management Office: "The highest number of Japanese prisoners concentrated in Xuzhou was 17,405. Currently, there are 12,460 people waiting to be shipped back home. There are also 1,206 Japanese residents. Although no management agency was established for them, the management office is also responsible for them implicitly. 1,364 Japanese residents evacuated from the Bian-Zheng area towards the Jinpu Railway in the north. They turned back at Lincheng due to transportation issues and were also sent by the management office to Haizhou to board ships. Currently, the Japanese residents in Xuzhou are generally restricted to the area north of Qiming Road, east of Junyun Road, and south of the old Yellow River for residence."</p>
<p>These Japanese residents, apart from preparing to return to their country, their lifestyle does not seem to have changed much. Recently, they have been busy with the so-called repatriation organization. On December 26th, the preparatory committee for their new self-governing association held its second meeting. The preparatory committee includes 20 members, and the Consul General of Xuzhou was appointed as honorary chairman, signifying "integration of officials and civilians." One chairman (civilian), two vice-chairmen (one official and one civilian), were elected through voting on the 30th and announced on the 31st. A total of 50 officers were elected, but 5-6 of them were recommended by their government. Only men and women over the age of 20 have the right to vote. Their repatriation organization has been divided into seven groups and fourteen teams.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the Japanese residents received unofficial orders urging them to practice "self-restraint." There are two points of attention: (1) Hanging the Japanese flag at the door on New Year's Day and holding year-end and New Year banquets are all prohibited; (2) Drunkenness in the streets and women wearing fancy clothes are prohibited. On New Year's Day, the reporter did not see any Japanese flags hanging at the residences of Japanese residents, nor did they hang the Chinese national flag. Although there were still drunken Japanese hooligans flirting with waitresses in Japanese cafes, the expressions of the general Japanese residents were particularly cold and gloomy, silently hurrying under the eaves, and their traces were rarely seen.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, Xuzhou held a celebration with a large parade, military music, and decorations on the streets. A large V-shaped colored light, about ten feet high, was placed in the middle of the road, dazzlingly bright red. Xuzhou had a dance hall for the first time after the victory, located in a side room next to the National Assembly Hall. The space was less than 50 square meters, with broken horns and various dance tunes, extremely ear-splitting. There were only three dancers, but the dancers were very enthusiastic. Soldiers on leave gathered outside the door to watch, and then broke in and crowded into the hall without dispersing, silently and without smiling, witnessing this "miracle," almost causing conflict. This was also an interlude on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>The reporter was delayed in Xuzhou for five days due to the interruption of train transportation on the Pu-Xu section of the Jinpu Railway. Tomorrow, I may be able to take an engineering car to Nanjing. Xuzhou is currently launching a comfort campaign, and those responsible for organizing the campaign are ordering food from various places for air transport to the defending troops in Lincheng. The reporter dined twice at the New New Western Restaurant, and its baked bread was excellent. When asked about the reason, they said that they were baking a large amount, so it was always fresh. However, there is a ban on the military ordering civilian fuel from the Liuquan coal mine through connections, and since it is all used for road use, it is slightly difficult.

<h3>A Message to Adventurers in Kunming: Your Fields Will Be Overgrown; Why Not Return Home? Speculative Activities in Zhan Yi City Are Coming to an End</h3>
<p>By Our Kunming Special Correspondent Zhang Jun</p>
<p>On the lifeline of adventurers, Kunming and Zhanyi were once their paradises. Although the rise of these two paradises was separated by several years, the style and changes of the latter (Zhanyi) surpassed the former. Some people compare Kunming to Shanghai before the war and Zhanyi to an early American Western city, and there are indeed some similarities. Although most adventurers lost their paradise in Kunming and Zhanyi, some are still struggling here. As for those who have returned home, their future may be boundless. In the vast recovered areas, where can't a new paradise be rebuilt?</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall History of Paradise Unfolds Two Lines of Struggle</p>
<p>When talking about the rise and fall history of Kunming's paradise, one should not ignore the "struggle of two lines": one is the originally smooth but later obstructed Yunnan-Burma Road, and the other is the China-India air route flying over the Hump. The former was the golden age of drivers, and the latter was the golden age of brokers, speculators, and the "international route." The former caused the sudden rise of paradise, and the latter brought paradise to its peak. The decline of the two lines strangled the adventurers' lifeline. Some adventurers, having no place to use their skills, attacked the tombs. Tombs in the suburbs of Kunming are often robbed. In November and December of last year, there were over a hundred tomb robbery cases, especially female tombs. Alas, the dead cannot rest in peace in the earth, which is truly a tragedy. Thinking back to those years, brokers filled paradise, gambling houses, dance halls, and taverns. How many people spent money like dirt? Looking today, the doors are deserted, the number of unemployed has surged, and the sadness of adventure is even displayed on street stalls, which cannot help but make people laugh and cry!</p>
<p>Complex Adventurers: The Majority Are Large and Small Brokers</p>
<p>The so-called adventurers have the most complex components, and brokers are the majority. Most brokers in Kunming have no leaders and no organization, but they are related to trade associations. In terms of types, the largest brokers initially specialized in various American military businesses and later switched to contacting the Logistics Department and the Transportation Bureau. Small brokers, like mercury spilling on the ground, are ubiquitous, never sitting in one place for long, and use connections to enrich themselves. In terms of nature, there is a type of "empty-hearted young masters" who specialize in running errands. Another type is "upright people" who often obtain deposits through various transaction contracts to make profits. There are even more people who concurrently or exclusively engage in brokerage businesses by relying on their occupations, power, and social connections. It is estimated that before the victory, there were about 50,000 to 60,000 people in the above three categories. The goods that brokers traded were initially most profitable with gasoline. Later, due to government regulations on colors, transactions were restricted, but adventurers who were generally said to have backing made huge profits from this. The second was alcohol. Many people became rich in this industry, and most of the sources were private goods, with very few people starting factories to manufacture it themselves. Some people often rely on transferring contracts to make profits, and some people specialize in "running contracts." The people in this industry, in addition to having an adventurous spirit, must have some background in personnel matters. The third major category of goods is trafficking in firearms, drugs, and other contraband. There are also those who transport or pack contraband on behalf of others. Many disputes and bloody incidents often occur in this type of trade or transport.</p>
<p>Setting Up Homecoming Stalls: The Most Advanced Adventurers</p>
<p>Formal merchants and financial figures in Kunming generally failed or succeeded due to speculative adventures. Among commercial banks, those from the Jiangzhe region were the most stable, so they suffered no major losses before and after this victory. The banks from the Sichuan region, with weaker foundations, faced extremely difficult situations at the beginning of the victory. Local banks were better able to weather the difficulties because they could transfer funds to each other. Most of the giants of speculative adventure failed in gold, US dollars, and gauze. A mid-level employee of a certain bank originally had a capital of 20 million yuan, and then borrowed another 40 million yuan to purchase gold and foreign currency, and then mortgaged them for loans to hoard other goods. When the firecrackers of victory sounded, he was in debt of 80 million yuan. As a result, he could not afford to pay and ran to Chongqing to commit suicide. From August of the year before last to August of last year, it can be called the year of the frenzy of gold and foreign currency. Adventurers, formal merchants, semi-official and semi-commercial figures, and officials in disguise all concentrated on this line. As a result, they all suffered惨敗 and were in a state of disgrace. From August to October of last year, it was called the "month of relief appeals." Merchants and factories, through public opinion organs and newspapers, demanded emergency relief. A certain gold shop, holding 8,000 taels of gold savings certificates, was also calling out that it was terrible. Although ordinary citizens and civil servants suffered the same fate, they were relatively calm. After several years of hard work, once everything was lost, they sighed at their bad luck and set up a homecoming stall to earn some travel expenses. Such adventurers are the best of them.</p>
<p>Making a Deal: Immediately Becoming a Guest at the Gambling Table</p>
<p>When talking about the adventurers' paradise, one cannot ignore Kunming's gambling houses. Big and small gambling became commonplace, and those wagering millions of yuan were countless. One or two giants in the financial world had their futures ruined at the poker table. According to the reporter, there was a group of mid-level brokers who regularly gathered to gamble and take commissions, taking turns as hosts. The entertainment fee for one table of gamblers was often 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per night, and their commission income was around one million yuan. In the past year, the total amount of commissions they took in turns reached about 100 million yuan, from which one can see the rest. Friends who failed in the gambling house, as long as they made an adventurous or speculative deal, were immediately guests at the front of the gold-waving table again. However, these people must have their background there.</p>
<p>The Rise of Zhanyi City Began Last March</p>
<p>Kunming and Zhanyi can be called two mother-and-child cities in the activities of adventurers. This small child city of Zhanyi began to rise last March and declined with the victory against Japan. The city had originally been a small station of the southwest highway and the East Yunnan-Sichuan highway, and its position was far less than Qujing. It had suddenly become an important transportation hub for the Southwest region thanks to the extension of the Yunnan-Sichuan Railway to Zhanyi and the building of a large airfield. A large number of U.S. air forces and the expeditionary forces converged in the city, which boosted the formerly despondent and desolate marketplace. A new marketplace was built near the railway station in a short period of time. Most numerous were the bars, many of which hired hostesses to cater to the American soldiers. The second most numerous were the tea houses, which were always packed and which had become the headquarters for the brokers. Adventurers flocked to the city, competing to buy and sell gasoline, alcohol, foreign currencies, and other contraband. Arguments, fights, and murders often occurred at the teahouses and restaurants, either due to transaction disputes, failed extortion, or uneven distribution of loot. Gunshots were often heard in the rooms and on the streets. It was not uncommon to be startled several times a night. Most of the soldiers, merchants, hooligans, and gangsters who came and went carried guns for self-defense. Gangs took the opportunity to become active, recruiting a large number of cadres, and created a special force in the city. The local authorities could not restrain them either. Speculative merchants who wanted to operate there had to socialize with those people; otherwise, they would lose both their money and their people. Even the adventurers of Kunming felt a little headache about the abnormal development of this small city.</p>
<p>After the Two Cities Prospered, the Social Atmosphere Was Affected</p>
<p>Adventurers in Kunming and Zhanyi promoted the prosperity of the two cities and influenced the atmosphere of the two cities. In the past, those who pushed carts and peddled goods were vastly different between spring and autumn. Observing their haughtiness and popularity, honest and enthusiastic people often found it laughable, and people who were generally forced by the environment also unwittingly got involved in this adventurous and speculative fire waterfall. If this situation continued to develop, it was hard to imagine where it would lead. The sound of victory became the death knell of paradise, shattering the adventurers' spring dreams. The adventurers paled in comparison, 群嘆 that the victory came too quickly. Who said: People's hearts are like the sea, and desires are hard to fill. You can trust me on this. After the victory against Japan, some people were still struggling, and the phenomenon of a sudden burst of energy before death also occurred. It is not surprising. In short, today's Kunming is changing, and today's Zhanyi is gradually becoming calm. Although the development of the two cities is difficult to predict, the paradise of the past may not reappear. Adventurers, the vast recovered areas need your kind of spirit to develop. Your fields have been overgrown; why not return home?</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Powerful Guarantee of Peace and Happiness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Political Consultative Conference opened, and both the central government and the Communist Party issued orders to cease conflict. These two great pieces of good news not only brought smiles to the faces of the Chinese people but also were welcomed by people around the world who care about the Chinese political situation. The American public even said that the brightest vision in the world today is focused on China. The price of Chinese public bonds in the London market also rose as a result. The Chinese people today have such wise leaders, such a tolerant government, and such parties that can abandon their prejudices and work together harmoniously. The Chinese people are indeed excited and glorious, and they feel that the future is bright and unlimited. Although in the five months since the Japanese surrendered, we were extremely ashamed of the unfortunate internal strife, but yesterday, as if a straw hat were lifted, the clouds were swept away, and a heavy stone was lifted from everyone's hearts. The peace and happiness that the people of the whole country should have enjoyed after a hundred years of humiliation and eight years of bloody battles also had a dawn from then on.</p>
<p>After reading the opening speech of Chairman Chiang at the Consultative Conference and the speeches of the members, we not only felt that peace and happiness had dawned, but also believed that peace and happiness had indeed obtained a strong guarantee. The reason is very simple: to enable the people to enjoy peace and happiness, we must first respect the people's proper status and legitimate rights, and the respect for the people's status and rights depends on the fact that the parties participating in political activities can truly have a democratic spirit. From the situation after the opening of this Consultative Conference, it can be said that the government and all parties can generally experience this point and have the determination to cultivate the democratic spirit necessary for engaging in modern politics. Therefore, what we think is gratifying today is secondary to the issuance of the ceasefire order, and what is most commendable is that political figures from all sides have the determination to develop that democratic spirit. With a democratic spirit among politicians, the people can truly obtain a guarantee of peace and happiness.</p>
<p>From what place do we see that people from all sides seem to have a democratic spirit?</p>
<p>First of all, we cannot but praise the greatness of Chairman Chiang's leadership spirit. When the meeting of the three-person group became almost a stalemate, he generously agreed to revise his original proposal, so that the "ceasefire" order could be happily issued yesterday morning before the opening of the Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said in his opening speech, "In order to form effective resolutions, sometimes eliminating our proposals is of greater value than insisting on our opinions." He himself was the first to practice these bright and upright words. Not only that, but he also repeatedly said that he wanted to be sincere and frank, selfless and impartial, and to have a broad and long-term vision, and what he never forgot was "the most urgent demands of our people today." In order to realize the people's minimum requirements, the requirements for stability and restoration, the requirements for living and working in peace and contentment, and the requirements for peaceful unification, he believes that the government "only has a sense of responsibility and obligation and has no selfish or gainful views." Therefore, he hopes that this meeting "can always maintain understanding and harmony," and his resolute order to stop the conflict before the opening of the meeting is indeed the most obvious symbol of this understanding and harmony. What is especially worth praising is that Chairman Chiang formally announced the four measures decided by the government to protect the people's rights before the meeting was discussed, so that "the freedom of the people," "the legal status of political parties," "the universal suffrage from the bottom up," and "the release of political prisoners" can be seen in facts from now on. We used to always say that the politics of the Three People's Principles must be politics that take the road of democracy. Today, thanks to the appeal of Chairman Chiang's great spirit, we believe even more that the democratic spirit inherently possessed by the Kuomintang will be carried forward and enhanced day by day. What we hope is that the heads of all responsible departments of the government and responsible personnel at all levels will appreciate the democratic spirit of the chairman and immediately do their best in their duties to realize these four measures. Only by showing in fact that these four measures have achieved practical results can it be said that China has taken a big step on the road to democracy.</p>
<p>Secondly, the speech of the Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai was vastly different from the telegram of General Zhu De in the early days of the Japanese surrender. In the eyes of General Zhu De at that time, how could there be a national government? How could he be concerned about the Chinese people? Today, the Communist Party representatives can praise "Chairman Chiang's foresight and determination" and can care about "the suffering of the people." It is indeed progress, and it can also be said that they have some democratic spirit. And what is most moving is that the Communist Party representatives today already know that only by "trusting the people and relying on the people" and hoping that all members "will be responsible to the people and responsible to the country" are they willing "to tolerate to the greatest extent" and discuss state affairs with all parties. A political party can originally have political opinions, but it should not be prejudiced in its "own opinions." And political parties in democratic countries especially need the opposition party to learn from each other to achieve mutual promotion. As long as each political party can slightly eliminate the self-righteousness of its own opinions and think of the people and the country at all times, then democratic etiquette such as criticism, blame, understanding, and tolerance between parties will naturally be achieved without expectation. What had the Communist army done for five months by fighting for land after the Japanese surrender? "The suffering of the people" has deepened! The appeals of the people have almost become hoarse. Fortunately, today, the Communist Party has awakened and is willing to "under the guidance of the martyrs and in front of the portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen," to swear next time, "never to let China have another civil war." This is truly a thorough realization after understanding! We do not hope that there is no criticism or blame between political parties, nor do we dare to say that political parties are only allowed to understand and tolerate. But no matter whether it is criticism and blame or understanding and tolerance, one cannot leave the parliament and step onto the battlefield. We believe that the Communist Party's democratic spirit of abandoning the battlefield and re-entering the parliament can indeed change the Communist Party's style forever in the future. We also believe that the Communist Party will be able to understand the true desires and urgent demands of the people in the future and will not be confined by the "own opinions" of the Communist Party alone. A party must never think that the opinions of my party are the opinions of the people, and the propositions of my party are the propositions of the people. As Chairman Chiang said, "Before the implementation of constitutional government, the people's true will has not yet had a way to be fully expressed." Indeed, only with such a spirit of modesty can everyone often experience the will of the people and take care of the people's happiness when discussing state affairs together.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say a word to the participants of the Political Consultative Conference: This conference is a landmark meeting in history. Although you are not elected by the people, you must never forget the people at all times! Millions of people are watching the progress of the meeting! You have been hired by the National Government to discuss state affairs together, and your acceptance and reform are related to the great plans of the country, so tolerance is acceptable, but perfunctoriness is not, understanding is acceptable, but accommodation is not. You should overcome any difficulties and not shake the foundation of the country in the slightest. You must understand that although the members of the Political Consultative Conference are not representatives of the people, the Consultative Conference is not an institution for exercising national sovereignty, and since you have participated, you should act according to your conscience and "be responsible to the people and responsible to the country." If you can take this responsibility, the people's peace and happiness can be more firmly guaranteed by your joint efforts.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Slightly Lower Than Previous Closing; US Dollar Plummets Sharply in Afternoon Trading; Rumors Spread That US Dollars Cannot Be Used for Settlements</h3>
<p>Spot gold, after a weak initial surge yesterday, continued to languish, unable to escape its constrained trajectory. Though market prices were ostensibly cheaper than the publicly quoted prices for securities, they were strangled by listed prices, making any unusual gains difficult. Various parties were eager to test the waters, but most remained in a wait-and-see posture.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, prices rose to 8,430,000 due to positive reports from the wartime capital market, with some paper industry firms adding to their positions. However, this upward activity was short-lived. Northern merchants slightly eased their holdings at higher prices, and the upward momentum was swiftly checked. Short-selling and profit-taking emerged simultaneously, and by midday, prices were again pressured down to 8,240,000. The afternoon initially showed stability, hovering around 8,350,000. However, unexpectedly, rumors emerged that US dollars could not be used for settlements. This sparked widespread speculation unfavorable to the US dollar, causing a significant weakening of the dollar, which in turn affected the gold market.</p>
<p>Eventually, prices settled around 8,250,000, resulting in a slight drop of 1,000 compared to the previous closing. Gold jewelry was listed at 89,000 per unit, fine silver at 700 yuan, and silver dollars fluctuated around 460. The black market exchange rate remained sluggish, with interest rates ranging from approximately 8 to 10 percent.</p>
<p>The US dollar showed relative stability yesterday morning, moving in tandem with the gold market. Currency exchange businesses actively reduced their holdings, causing the exchange rate to fall from around 1445 yuan. By midday, it was fluctuating around 1430 yuan. The afternoon initially remained stable, but after 2:30 PM, rumors suddenly spread that US dollars could not be used for settlement, causing the rate to plummet to 1400 yuan. This was followed by further rumors of a ban on foreign currency exports and a new exchange rate fixed at 1365 yuan, leading to a breach of the 1400 yuan level and a retreat to around 1380 yuan. The closing price was 35 yuan lower than the previous close, and this was still the selling price.</p>
<h3>Type C Shares Continue to Rise; Chinese Stocks Experience Another Frenzied Surge; Foreign Stocks Show Steady and Strong Performance</h3>
<p>Publicly quoted Type C shares opened yesterday, rising to 1260 yuan due to the issued ceasefire order between the Nationalists and Communists, coupled with rumors of an imminent resumption of securities trading. Short sellers rushed to cover their positions, further exciting buyers, and prices climbed to around 1350 yuan. Later, with a slight market correction, Type C shares hovered around the 1300 yuan mark at midday. The final result was an increase of 100 yuan for Type C shares compared to the previous closing, while Type A and B shares fell by 50 yuan, Type D shares by 30 yuan, and Type E shares by 10 yuan. This reflects the time sensitivity, where miscellaneous and popular stocks cannot move in unison.</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market was chaotic yesterday. Paper industry stocks were actively sold at higher prices, transitioning from strong to weak. Retail investors engaged in widespread short-selling. Yong Yarn declined from 1140 yuan to 1060 yuan, Meyer from 840 yuan to 770 yuan, and New Light from 66 yuan to below 62 yuan. Major players manipulated the market, leaving retail investors bewildered.</p>
<p>The situation stabilized somewhat near midday, but unexpectedly, in the afternoon, tea firms dumped large quantities of Xinhe Yarn Factory shares, unable to deliver the goods, and proposed settling the contracts in cash. This triggered a massive buying frenzy. Although the trades were limited due to the late hour, the bidding soared wildly amidst the chaos. Yong Yarn briefly jumped above 1250 yuan, Meyer above 900 yuan, and the "Three Small Hot Stocks" were also stimulated, surging by about 10%. Afterward, there was a slight correction. Ultimately, amid calls for promoting production and resuming securities trading, Yong Yarn and Meyer each rose by 130 yuan, the "Three Small Hot Stocks" gained 10%, and even less popular stocks followed suit to a considerable extent. The speculative atmosphere was intense, reaching a boiling point. Things must decay from within before insects breed. Beware of unexpected shocks.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued their upward trend, showing a remarkably steady performance, unlike the arbitrary swings of Chinese stocks. Benefiting from the positive environment, most stocks generally increased by another 5% to 10%.</p>
<h3>Amid Calls to Suppress Prices, Grain Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Ships Rice from Wuhu</p>
<p>Demand for rice and grains in Tianjin and Qingdao remained strong. Early Indica rice continued to rise by 700-800 yuan, Northern Japonica rice also rose by 400-500 yuan, and Indica rice also increased by 300-500 yuan. Bai Yuan, Yin Yuan, and Beiyang silver dollars also attracted inquiries, leading to a further increase of 500 yuan. Yellow soybeans from Minhua revived, recovering from weakness and gaining 200-300 yuan. The oil market fluctuated wildly, but today, due to increased digestion, it rose by 300-500 yuan. The flour market remained firm, but demand weakened, leading to a stagnant trend. Soybean cakes, with full shipping berths from Nanyang, saw a decline in demand from holders, causing prices to fall by a small hundred yuan or so. The liquor market was unremarkable, while raw peanuts remained firm, similar to sesame.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] A large quantity of Wuhu rice has arrived in port. This week, over 8,000 bags have arrived, transported by iron barges towed by China Merchants Bureau's Guotai, Guoding, Feibo, Feitian, and Feimin ships. It is reported that a larger quantity is awaiting shipment, so the Bureau has dispatched the Jiangxin ship today to Wuhu for loading. This rice is being transported on behalf of the Food Storage and Transportation Office. Additionally, 23,000 bags of flour are being transported to Hong Kong by the Yuezhou ship as relief supplies.</p>
<h3>No Prospects for Warehouse Deliveries; Rayon Shows Its Sharp Edge; Factory Prices Show Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>The silk market, which had been weak for days, suddenly rebounded yesterday. Rayon showed its edge from the start. No. 120 Tianqiao was at 850,000 yuan, and amid a chorus of buyers, it quickly rose to 900,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to trade at 910,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were at 715,000 yuan, 80,000-90,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The reason for the rise is that there are no prospects for the delivery of silk stored in warehouses, leading to hoarding of spot goods and making it difficult to suppress market prices. Factory prices showed slight activity, with a small improvement in prices. The silk market initially showed no improvement, but was then uniformly raised due to the sharp rise in raw materials. Meyer quilt covers were at 580,000 yuan per 100, and Minsheng brocade成交价 was at 9,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Can't Be Suppressed; Coarse and Fine Yarn Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose again yesterday, due to a steady stream of customers coming to purchase. Customers from Nanjing and other places were particularly interested in smaller yarn factories with lower prices and clean colors. Transactions between peers were also quite active. Based on 16-count Guangming yarn, 20-count and 16-count yarn rose by about 30,000 yuan compared to yesterday, and fine yarn rose by about 60,000-70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Outlook for the Tea Market</h3>
<p>European and American Demand for Chinese Tea is Very Strong</p>
<p>Russia Has Been in Contact with Tea Merchants</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The overseas sales of Chinese tea from this city are currently suspended due to the incomplete resumption of maritime transport and the authorities' failure to announce foreign exchange rates. According to reliable information obtained by reporters from relevant industry personnel, demand for Chinese tea is strong in European and American countries. It is also rumored that the Russian government may abandon its monopoly, and there is momentum to start trading. They are currently in contact with a tea merchant in this city. However, since the tea production season has passed, there is likely to be no significant development until the new tea season next spring.</p>
<p>The tea market yesterday was still most strongly driven by demand from Tianjin, and sales from local shops were also quite good, so confidence continued to be optimistic, and prices remained quite firm.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Sales Active</h3>
<p>Sales of bituminous coal lumps have become healthier, especially with general speculative shops eagerly purchasing embankment lumps, causing the market to turn firm and strong. Bituminous coal dust followed suit and became active. Although the market price of anthracite coal remained stable, sales were not as smooth as before due to the continuous arrival of goods. The quality of the coal that arrived in this city was better than previous batches, and although the market atmosphere was weak, asking prices were high.</p>
<h3>Turnaround for Black Iron Billets</h3>
<p>It was previously reported that 2,000-pound black iron billets had arrived from abroad, causing panic and prices to plummet. In half a month, the price dropped by more than two-thirds. At the beginning of this month, some were even selling them for 300,000 yuan each. Recently, there has been a slight turnaround, as the feeling of terror has gradually faded and new orders from abroad require more than 400,000 yuan. Therefore, spot goods are currently being offered at around 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shortage of No. 12 Lead Wire</h3>
<p>A buyer is currently asking brokers to purchase approximately 400-500 dan of No. 12 soft lead wire. However, the market supply of this type of lead wire is very scarce, so those who hold the goods are waiting for a good price before selling.</p>
<h3>Paper Prices Stabilize; Hoarders Sell to Obtain Cash</h3>
<p>The upward trend in foreign paper prices is gradually stabilizing. Due to the recent price increases, sellers believe they can sell their holdings, leading to a balance between supply and demand. Yesterday, it was reported that foreign exchange rates will soon be set, based on commodity prices. Paper merchants generally believe that this standard will consider both imports and exports. The current paper prices are several times higher than pre-war levels. If the exchange rate is set, the so-called standard based on commodity prices cannot be based on current paper prices. Therefore, there will inevitably be a large drop in the future, so there is a tendency to sell to obtain cash. However, due to thin inventories, there is no large-scale release of goods, so the market is still stabilizing within a range.</p>
<h3>Printing Industry Resumes Operations; Orders Machines from the United States</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Many printing businesses were suspended during the war. Rubber printing machines were taken away or seized by the enemy puppets, and stone printing machines (which are no longer very useful) were automatically dismantled and sold as scrap metal. Now that the war has been won and restoration is underway, trademark designs for dyeing and weaving industries, as well as cigarette paper packaging for cigarette factories, all require printing. There is a great need, but few businesses in the industry can resume printing. It is reported that they are actively ordering the latest machines from the United States to make up for the shortage.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The West Paint Industry Association has been ordered to merge with the Domestic Paint Industry Association, and Zhang Zhenhou has been appointed as a standing committee member responsible for convening the meeting.</p>
<p>Yu Zhijing, the restructuring committee member of the Knitting Industry, has resigned and his resignation has been approved.</p>
<p>Chemical raw material manufacturers have requested to form an association, and they have been ordered to merge into the Chemical Raw Material Industry, and Wu Jichun, Chen Ruixiang, and Hong Zuliang have been appointed as restructuring committee members. Fu Renzhi, the restructuring committee member of the Paraffin Wax Industry Association, has passed away, and Yang Guangshi has been appointed to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>A silk textile factory industry association has been established, and Xu Ligeng and two others have been appointed as organizing members.</p>
<p>Chen Chongyu, manager of Sanxing Ink Factory, and others have requested to form an ink industry association, and preparations have been approved.</p>
<p>Zhang Fengshou, Zhou Baozhi, Qian Boyan, Zhu Jianping, and Xia Peiji have been appointed as restructuring committee members of the Inland River Shipping Industry Association.</p>
<p>The local scrap metal industry plans to organize an association. It has been ordered to merge with the steel bar and scrap iron industry. However, the former's main business is steel bars, foreign yuan, foreign squares, and foreign plates imported from Europe and the United States, which are used for construction and machinery manufacturing, while the latter is broken metal used for making agricultural tools. Due to their different natures, approval has been granted for them to organize separately.</p>
<p>Five people, including Chu Xianfa, have been appointed as organizing members for the Hardware Factory Industry Association.</p>
<p>Seven people, including Yao Xinghuang, have been appointed as organizing members for the Dairy Industry Association.</p>
<p>Ge Xianzong and others have been recommended as organizing members for the private ferry industry and their recommendation has been approved.</p>
<h3>Commercial News Summary</h3>
<p>After the arrival of new Longkou vermicelli, it coincided with the start of winter sales. Demand from Guangdong merchants was very strong, so the market has risen to a new high.</p>
<p>The supply of dried lily flowers is sporadic, but demand is not weak, so the price increase is very strong. Yesterday, the best goods with good color were offered at a tighter price.</p>
<p>Due to purchases by Hong Kong merchants, persimmon cakes rose again, followed by melon seeds. Black dates rose again, and red dates were short, with prices opening higher than the previous listing. Only mid-range peach meat was available, and prices were raised accordingly.</p>
<p>There is a shortage of both 45 white sugar and the factory's white spot goods. With strong demand from customers, the market rose sharply again.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth was previously affected by the sale of yarn and cloth by the China Textile Construction Company, and the market was slightly weak, but its price was not much lower than the market price, and it could only be picked up after ten days, so the factory quickly returned to its former state.</p>
<p>Hangzhou silk crepe is frequently purchased by Hangzhou merchants. Traders believe that there is a shortage of goods, so they are supporting prices, and the trend is tight.</p>
<h3>International Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The US Export-Import Bank will soon lend China £825,000,000 to purchase 3,000 bales of US cotton.</p>

<p>The Japanese Ministry of Finance is rushing to print new 1,000-yen and 500-yen notes to be circulated in the market in April.</p>
<p>Excess Liquidity in the Market; Hong Kong Notes Rise Sharply; Target Set for Old Notes at Half Price; Guangdong Merchants Take the Opportunity to Sell Heavily</p>
<p>Old Hong Kong notes have no speculative value and are constrained by low prices in Hong Kong. As a result, they fell by 5 yuan. New notes are entirely manipulated by securities firms, gradually rising from around 75 yuan. In the afternoon, they were bid up to above 90 yuan. Finally, affected by the ban on foreign currency exports and other factors, they fell back to around 85 yuan. The result was still a gain of 11 yuan compared to the previous closing, but this was the selling price. Guangdong merchants sold out all their holdings throughout the day. There is a shortage of notes with a serial number starting with 36. The chips for 37 are looser. Major players called for higher prices, and the excess liquidity had no other outlet, concentrating on one sector. The initial target of the manipulators is half price for old notes, a price of 120 yuan. It is reported that current prices in Hong Kong are much lower than those in Shanghai. The massive selling by Guangdong merchants today is for this reason. The grand performance by speculators is truly breathtaking.</p>

<h3>National Lin University in the Capital Resumed Classes Yesterday; Student Representatives Went to Professors' Residences to Urge Them to Stay; They Also Visited Director Wang in the Hospital to Express Sympathy</h3>
<p>[Express Telegram from This Newspaper in Nanjing] Nine students, including Yu Baiqing, who caused trouble at Lin University, were interrogated by the court yesterday. Eight were held in the Model Prison, and one was released on bail. When Yu and others were detained, six female students went to the Municipal Government to ask Mayor Ma for leniency and to request the court to release them, but were unsuccessful. Whether the case will be prosecuted by the court or by the victim, Wang Shulin, through a private prosecution, will depend on the results of the prosecutor's investigation. Lin University resumed classes this morning. The former puppet Central Student Self-Government Association has been dissolved informally, and student emotions have calmed down. Generally, it is observed that the student unrest was caused by students violating the law. Now that the students involved are aware of the sanctity of the law, they respectfully accept the constraints of the law with a child's heart. It is possible to arrive at the conclusion that "violations of the law cannot be excused, and it is greatly to be lamented that young students are far from the law," and to obtain a lenient sentence. This is an evil tide in the vast sea of learning after the recovery. Due to student awareness and the sanctity of the law, the prompt resolution of the case will become the starting point for an improvement in the academic atmosphere.</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper in Nanjing] Some students caused trouble at National Lin University in the capital, resulting in injuries to the director of the class, Wang Shulin, which caused indignation among the professors, who all submitted their resignations.</p>
<p>Students Posted Slogans Welcoming Director Wang</p>
<p>The majority of students, influenced by this, abandoned their studies and expressed appeals in writing, fully posting slogans such as "Welcome Director Huang of the Ministry of Education to come to the class to supervise!" "Welcome Director Wang to come to the class to preside!" "Please ask the professors to withdraw their resignations and resume classes as soon as possible!" "Students uphold justice and overthrow the minority of corrupt elements!" In addition to sending Director Huang Rujin of the Ministry of Education to the class for supervision, the Ministry of Education announced on the 9th the expulsion of 14 students who were the ringleaders of the trouble: Yu Baiqing, Li Shutang, Yao Dajun, Sun Di, Ding Jincheng, Ouyang Zhen, Yang Shihou, Yan Jiqing, Wang Dingshi, Zhao Zhongkai, Zuo Yuanliang, Qu Qilin, Yi Zhen, and Sheng Chuanxian.</p>
<p>The District Court Prosecutor's Office Detained Eight Students</p>
<p>The District Court Prosecutor's Office in the capital determined that the students had committed a criminal offense by gathering to assault Director Wang and scheduled a preliminary hearing at the court on the morning of the 10th, detaining nine students involved in the trouble. After the prosecutor's initial investigation, eight students were detained and one was released on bail. It is heard that a public prosecution will be filed, and they will be subject to legal punishment. Several students had tears in their eyes, regretting it too late. Director Huang Rujin of the Ministry of Education also arrived at the class on the morning of the 10th and convened a speech to all the students in the Lin University remedial class. The Dean of Studies, Wu Zhaotang, represented Director Wang as chairman, gave a speech to the students, and then invited Director Huang Rujin to give a speech.</p>
<p>Director Huang Rujin of the Ministry of Education Addressed the Students</p>
<p>Director Huang briefly described the proceedings of the post-recovery resettlement conference convened by the Ministry of Education last September, and the purpose of establishing the Lin University remedial class was to transform the thinking of young people, guide them into the right track, and supplement their knowledge so that students in puppet schools could enter regular universities through this bridge to complete their studies. Director Wang recruited many famous professors, who came to Beijing from thousands of miles away to teach, all to fulfill the important mission of revitalizing national culture and completing their educational responsibilities. Now, a few students have acted improperly and assaulted Director Wang. This unfortunate incident is, of course, the action of a few people. I have previously come to the class to inspect and seen that most students, although they have not attended classes, have been able to maintain order, take notes, and study on their own. Now the government, in order to rectify the academic atmosphere, sacrifices a few people [still announced in the name of Director Wang, according to the order of the Ministry of Education, expelling 14 students] in order to protect the studies of the majority of students. If another unfortunate incident occurs, it will inevitably lead to dissolution, and the students will permanently lose their education.</p>
<p>Teachers and Students Jointly Decided to Start Classes on the 11th</p>
<p>Subsequently, all the students present selected representatives Lin Weiqing and two others to earnestly request Director Huang to lead them to the hospital where Director Wang Shulin was located and to the residences of the professors to express sympathy and urge them to stay. At the same time, they jointly decided to resume classes on the 11th. When expressing sympathy and urging Director Wang and the professors to stay, they specifically pointed out that classes could definitely be started on the 11th. (Stupid)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province's Education Restoration Funds: The Finance Department Will Advance 5 Million Yuan First</h3>
<p>[Report from Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang] Since the restoration of education in Jiangxi Province, many school buildings of provincial schools and community education institutions have been destroyed or damaged and need to be repaired or rebuilt, but funds are not available. Therefore, the then-acting Director of the Finance Department, Shi Wei, submitted a proposal to the Provincial Affairs Meeting, which was passed, and a telegram was sent to the Central Government requesting the allocation of education restoration and construction funds. However, the need is urgent and slow solutions will not help. Therefore, emergency measures were drafted again. In addition to urging the Central Government to approve the allocation as soon as possible, before the allocation arrives, the Finance Department will temporarily advance 5 million yuan from the emergency measures fund to meet the urgent need.</p>

<h3>Football League Group A: Italian Overseas Chinese vs. Korean Overseas Chinese at the Rubber Garden Starting at 2:30 PM</h3>
<p>There are three football league matches today, one each in Groups A, B, and C, to be held at Jiaozhou Park and Hongkou Park. Among them, the Group A match featuring the Italian Overseas Chinese team is sure to attract the interest of football fans. The team forfeited its first match against the British Navy, which aroused widespread attention. It has been learned that at that time, the team lacked leadership, and the players' jerseys and shoes were not in place, making it difficult to form a team. Now, Qu Yaokang, an enthusiastic figure in the sports world, has come forward to take charge. Therefore, the team will be able to appear in full new attire today, and their long-awaited football skills will allow fans to see them again. The Korean Overseas Chinese team forced a draw in their first match against Hequn, and their recent form is still good. However, based on the Italian Overseas Chinese team's performance, they may be able to overcome the Korean Overseas Chinese team. The schedule for today and the lineup of the Italian Overseas Chinese team are as follows:</p>
<p>Italian Overseas Chinese vs. Korean Overseas Chinese (Group A) 2:30 PM Rubber Garden</p>
<p>Indian vs. Qingbai (Group B) 2:30 PM Hongkou Park No. 1</p>

<h3>Save the Children Who Are About to Drop Out of School: A Tuition Fee Issue Worthy of Attention at Present. Please Refer to the Tuition Fee Standards Set by the Municipal Bureau of Education.</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>A few days ago, your newspaper reported that the adjustment of tuition fees for this spring semester has been decided, approximately 12,000 yuan for primary school and 16,000 yuan for middle school. This shocking number is simply appalling! Last summer's middle school (private) tuition fees, calculated in legal tender, amounted to hundreds of thousands of yuan, which was already a cry of hardship. Currently, rice prices remain the same, but tuition fees have increased so much that "universal education" has become "increased dropout rates"! If a family has two children, the tuition fees alone would be unbearable. Nowadays, it is common for every small clerk to earn three to five thousand yuan per month. If they have two children at home, there will be no living expenses left after paying tuition fees. If everyone has to find a way to get student loans to attend school, can education still be universal? Therefore, I would like to borrow a corner of your newspaper to appeal: Can the education authorities revise the tuition fees again, thinking for the masses and reducing tuition fees? I am also a person with children. If tuition fees increase like this, I really cannot afford it and will have to let my children drop out of school because I am just a small clerk in a dry goods store and do not have a large income. But there are countless people in Shanghai who are in my situation. Please save our children who are about to drop out of school!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>You Dongsheng</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The tuition fee standards for private middle and primary schools in this city for the second semester of the 34th year of the Republic of China were submitted by the Municipal Bureau of Education and resolved by the 16th Municipal Conference yesterday (the 11th) as follows:</p>
<p>The tuition fees for private middle and primary schools in the second semester of the 34th year of the Republic of China should be charged according to the following regulations: 6,000 yuan per student per semester for primary school students in urban areas, 9,000 yuan per student per semester for junior high school students in urban areas, and 12,000 yuan per student per semester for senior high school students in urban areas; 4,000 yuan per student per semester for primary school students in suburban areas, 6,000 yuan per student per semester for junior high school students in suburban areas, and 9,000 yuan per student per semester for senior high school students in suburban areas. The above amounts are the maximum amounts. Fees for books, sports, etc., should be submitted by each school to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval. The tuition fee standards set by the Municipal Bureau of Education are much lower than those mentioned in Mr. You's letter.</p>
<h3>The Task of the Labor Center Station</h3>
<p>— Lu Erqiang</p>
<p>Promoting Labor Education Throughout Shanghai</p>
<p>As early as ten years ago, the government, realizing that educational facilities could not meet the actual lives of the people, stipulated in the promulgated educational implementation measures that "labor," "production," and "practicality" should be the core of education at all levels, making "hand training" as important as "brain training," in order to cultivate the spirit of hard work and endurance among the people and enhance the skills of national production. The Ministry of Education actively paid attention to the establishment of labor courses in middle and primary schools, and in November of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it held the "National Exhibition of Labor Achievements of Vocational Schools and Middle and Primary Schools" in the capital, proving that labor training in middle and primary schools has practical value and can reflect the unity of school work and social production. From this, we can clearly see that as early as ten years ago, the education authorities had already paid attention to labor training and had cultivated a good foundation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after the July 7th Incident, the Japanese invaders attacked, and the War of Resistance broke out. Educational undertakings in the occupied areas suffered from enemy puppet destruction and have been in a state of decline for the past eight years. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the sun has reappeared, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly declared that educational revival is an urgent task for national reconstruction. In his book "China's Destiny," he listed the talent needed for the first ten years of implementing the industrial plan as approximately 2.5 million graduates from schools at all levels. From this, it can be seen that national revival cannot be achieved without active construction; active construction cannot be achieved without practical talents; and cultivating practical talents cannot be achieved without an educational foundation that emphasizes both hands and brain.</p>
<p>Shanghai's educational undertakings have always been the center of gravity in the country, and the number of middle and primary schools is the highest in the country. Now that the concessions have been abolished and educational administration is unified, the municipal education authorities are all senior engineers, admiring the government's emphasis on the revival of Shanghai's education and even more on the active cultivation of practical education. In the future, the facilities of middle and primary schools in this city will surely restore labor as one of the important subjects. However, in reality, schools may be limited by finances or ignorant of the trend, and the labor subjects and application equipment are inevitably neglected and simple. In order to remedy this, it is imperative that the municipal education authorities lead and preside over it. The Municipal Labor Center Station, sponsored by the Department of Social Education of the Municipal Bureau of Education, is currently being actively prepared with the aim of promoting labor education. Various regulations that have been formulated will be implemented starting next semester, so that the city's labor education can be brought onto the right track, in line with the needs of national construction and the purpose of unifying education and production, and gradually lead the country to prosperity and strength. Excerpts of the station's implementation guidelines are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establish several practical workshops such as metalworking, woodworking, clay work, bamboo work, and rattan work. All public and private middle and primary schools in the city that have not followed the labor curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry (according to the inspection report of the Supervision Department of the Municipal Bureau of Education) will be scheduled to notify the teachers of the school to lead the students to the station for practice.</p>
<p>(2) Hold vacation refresher courses for labor teachers to improve the teaching staff.</p>
<p>(3) Hold a city-wide middle and primary school labor exhibition to promote the public's understanding of the relationship between labor and industry.</p>
<p>(4) Select and sell the best student labor products for charity, to be used as funds to promote labor education, in order to achieve the unity of education and production.</p>
<p>(5) Establish an inspection committee to supervise all middle and primary schools in the city to comply with the labor curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry.</p>
<p>(6) Establish an editorial committee to compile new teaching materials for printing by various bookstores and for use as reference by labor teachers.</p>

<h3>Disposal of Properties of Traitors After Judgment: Assets of Japanese Nationals Must Be Handed Over. Liu Gongyun Answered Questions from Reporters Yesterday.</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Peng Xuepei, Chairman of the Shanghai District Review Committee for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property, and Liu Gongyun, Director of the Disposal Bureau, held a tea party at the meeting room of the China Bank Building on Renji Road at 4:30 PM yesterday to entertain news reporters. More than 60 reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Peng and Liu, as well as the heads of various groups of the Disposal Bureau, were also present on time. First, Peng Xuepei reported on the progress of the bureau's disposal work (full text recorded separately). Then, Liu Gongyun answered various questions raised by the press.</p>
<p>Open Bidding for Factories for Three Days</p>
<p>Director Liu continued, "Before the establishment of the Disposal Bureau, other agencies had already taken over various properties. Therefore, after the establishment of the Bureau, the main task was to adjust these. Currently, the Party and Government Takeover Committee has been disbanded, and the Real Estate Takeover Committee has been reorganized into the Bureau's Real Estate Group, whose main task is to review and return real estate owned by Allied nationals. The property previously taken over by the German Overseas Chinese Management Office has been transferred to the Bureau's Fourth Group. The Third Front Army's Military Supplies Takeover Committee has also come to an end, and the military supplies it has taken over will be handed over to the Ministry of Military Affairs." Liu then answered various questions raised by the reporters one by one. The main ones were: (1) The newspapers stored in various warehouses have been distributed to various newspapers in four batches. Recently, President Song has telegraphed Chief Chen in Taiwan, requesting that newspapers be shipped to Shanghai before the Lunar New Year to meet the urgent need. (2) The most difficult thing for the Bureau is the distribution of automobiles. Before the establishment of the Bureau, enemy and puppet vehicles had been taken over by various parties, making it extremely difficult to investigate. (3) There are not many water heaters in the Bureau's custody, and the supply-demand ratio is ten to one. Therefore, it is impossible to fully meet the needs of applicants. At most, the water heaters only have license plates, making it extremely difficult to prove ownership. Therefore, some applicants have accepted compensation and are willing to sacrifice the water heaters. (4) The shops and addresses selling sugar at discounted prices have been published in the newspapers. If there is any illegal refusal to sell, please report it. (5) All factories are open for inspection for three days before the bidding. (6) Repeated investigations into the sale of cloth at discounted prices have shown that there are few malpractices. Investigations into the sale of oil and fish are more difficult, and there may be some shortcomings in prevention, which will be corrected. However, the purpose of selling at discounted prices is directly to benefit the buyers and indirectly to suppress prices. The Bureau's sale at discounted prices has been effective. (7) After the withdrawal of Japanese nationals, their houses will be returned to the original owners if they can prove ownership and have not engaged in collaboration with the enemy. Otherwise, they will be disposed of by the Bureau. The agencies renting these houses should pay rent, and the contract can be signed by the tenant and the landlord themselves.</p>
<p>The Most Abundant Material is Cloth</p>
<p>(8) The quantity of materials cannot be reported because the warehouses have not been inventoried, but the most abundant material is cloth, followed by less grain, and many military supplies. (9) The warehouses taken over by the Navy have been checked by the Customs, and the shortage is being investigated. (10) Factories owned by Koreans and Taiwanese people can be returned if they have not engaged in enemy activities; otherwise, they will be confiscated. (11) Among the goods that factories were forced to cooperate with and hand over in the past, cloth was the most abundant. However, the enemy and puppets paid compensation at the time of confiscation, and it is extremely difficult to identify the ownership of the cloth, making it extremely difficult to return it. (12) The materials taken over by Jiang Gongmei have been handed over to the Third Front Army. The details of what is currently stored in the Bureau's Investigation Group are pending investigation. (13) When Japanese nationals leave, they need to hand over their assets. The Bureau has cooperated with the Japanese Overseas Chinese Management Committee and plans to find a large building to house these items in the future. (14) Regarding the regulations that manufacturers in this city were forced to cooperate with or illegally bought out their factory properties under enemy and puppet pressure and were separately confiscated by the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau after the victory, these manufacturers protested in groups because they did not accept the review. When reporters inquired about this issue with the Disposal Bureau, Director Liu replied: "Although forced cooperation and buyouts are facts, these merchants were not without benefits at the time. Therefore, the Bureau does not intend to consider this." This newspaper reporter asked: (1) What is the progress of the investigation into the warehouse theft case? Liu replied that the Bureau has sent each theft case to the Executive Yuan and is currently investigating it. (2) The properties of traitors must be disposed of after the judgment. (3) The first batch of socks and basins sold at discounted prices has been sold out, but there are still 20,000 pairs of socks and 30,000 basins available for sale.</p>

<p>(Report from this newspaper) The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, in accordance with the New Life Movement General Association in Chongqing, has uniformly changed its name to the New Life Movement Committee, under which branch associations are established. The work is promoted according to the outline of organizing basic units in various agencies, organizations, and schools. Currently, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters are the fastest in establishing branch associations in the aspect of various agencies and organizations. Other bureaus and agencies and schools are also actively organizing them.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Social Affairs Convenes an Evaluation Committee to Study the Financing of Funds</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize prices as the Lunar New Year approaches, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs convened the first Price Evaluation Committee on the afternoon of the 10th. The representatives of various agencies who attended were Xu Jiliao, Fang Zhichao, Jin Runxiang, Ge Jechen, etc., and the experts Liu Dajun, Wu Chengxi, Wei Youyi, etc. were also present. Ge Kexin, Acting Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, presided over the meeting, and the following results were discussed: (1) Order various trade associations to report price changes at any time. (2) Request the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to sell the sealed materials at low prices as soon as possible to stabilize prices. (3) It was resolved that merchants' reasonable profits should not exceed 20%. In order to guide idle funds towards normal development, the various committees of the association are currently studying with the Bureau of Social Affairs whether it is necessary to restore the capital market and other exchanges for financing funds. It is also learned that in order to solicit opinions from all walks of life, the association has publicly decided to hire Peng Xuepei, Chen Xing, Zhang Ziyi, Chen Bozhuang, Liu Gongyun, Xuan Yiwu, Liu Zhisheng, Pan Xuanyi, Li Zhaoji, Luo Qinghua, and others as consultants to the association, and plans to hire experts from various industries as special committee members to work together to stabilize prices appropriately.</p>
<h3>Yang Wendao: Please Approve Bail for Recuperation</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Lawyer Tang Huaiqun, who defended Yang Wendao pro bono ten years ago, recently told reporters that the Yang case has been approved by the chairman and handed over to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for handling, which shows the government's determination to maintain the dignity of the law. However, when the case was tried ten years ago, everyone knew that the Japanese wanted to take the opportunity to complete their political conspiracy. I also undertook this case pro bono entirely out of righteous indignation. Therefore, Yang Wendao may also be regarded as a political prisoner. Now that political prisoners arrested for anti-Japanese activities have been released one after another, Yang Wendao is still imprisoned in a frail and sick body. If he dies in prison, wouldn't it be a great injustice? Tang has submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting that he be granted bail for recuperation first, pending trial. In addition, the Cantonese venereal disease doctor Qiu Huimin, who reported Yang Wendao as the murderer to the Japanese detective ten years ago, was executed by shooting in Guangzhou in the 27th year of the Republic of China for being a traitor.</p>
<h3>Envoy Niu Goes to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The central government sent two envoys, Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, to the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai and to the three provinces of Zhejiang and Anhui. Since arriving in Shanghai at the beginning of last month to offer condolences, more than a month has passed. They have received approximately 430 letters of complaint from the people, which have been sorted and forwarded to the central government. It is now learned that Envoy Niu is scheduled to go to Hangzhou today for condolences, accompanied by Wang Yi, chairman of the Zhejiang Road Special Party Department. Envoy Ye is staying in the hospital for recuperation due to political harmony and was unable to go together.</p>
<h3>Nanjing West Road Will Be Widened</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The municipal government believes that the road around the racetrack on Nanjing West Road (Jing'an Temple Road) is not wide enough, which leads to traffic congestion. It has now been decided to widen it to 27 meters, which is 18 to 28 feet wider than the current road. According to this plan, in addition to filling in the river next to the racetrack, the walls there must also be demolished, and part of the racetrack inside the walls must be ceded. As for the implementation plan, the municipal government has ordered the Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Land Administration to jointly draft it.</p>
<p>Widening Jielu Road: Plan Drafted</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has completed the engineering plan to widen Jielu Road on Zhejiang Road. It has been decided to start work from Jielu Road at the North Railway Station and then extend it to Zhejiang Road. It is reported that it is currently waiting for the railway authorities to remove the iron fence near the North Railway Station. Once completed, work can begin. It is estimated that this project will require hundreds of road construction workers. At the same time, in order to take care of the people's housing, it has been decided not to affect the people's housing on both sides as much as possible.</p>
<h3>US Representatives Arrive in Shanghai to Investigate Surplus Materials</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The US State Department dispatched five representatives, including US congressmen and army representatives, to China to investigate the US military's surplus materials. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. These five senior officers are Congressmen Dunn and Nolan, Army Major General Rowe, Navy Deputy Rear Admiral Pendy, and Army Brigadier General Osborn.</p>
<h3>Continued Interrogation by the Garrison Headquarters: The Li Ze Case Involving Evidence of Treason; Decision to Handle the Case with a Stern and Just Attitude</h3>

They were interrogated about evidence of Li Ze's treason. The evidence provided by Huang and others was the same as what had been reported in the newspapers previously. After the interrogation, Section Chief Chen of the Investigation Section addressed the representatives, instructing all employees not to take any excessive actions that would lead to offenses, and that everything should be handled through proper procedures, awaiting legal resolution. The authorities are determined to handle the case with the strictest and fairest attitude. At 5:00 PM, the Garrison Headquarters summoned Shu Yueqiao again to investigate the process of reporting Li Ze.</p>
<h3>Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court; Continued Trial of Four Chinese Traitors Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The Special Criminal Tribunal of the Higher Court at Tilanqiao continuously held trials for four traitor cases yesterday, starting at 9:00 AM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Xiguang</p>
<p>43 years old, from Shandong. He was the head of the Special High Section of the Puppet Chengdu Road Police Bureau, specializing in intelligence work for the enemy. After the victory, he was reported and arrested. Judge Zhu Zonghai presided over the case yesterday. According to Yang's confession, it was true that he served as the head of the Special High Section and was ordered to arrest Han Zhen, who was responsible for air force liaison intelligence in Shanghai. However, after Han was arrested, he tried to prevent Han from being sent to the enemy's military police headquarters and even managed to bail him out. He later engaged in underground work. Han's wife, Zhu Qisun, testified that this was true, but because Han himself has now gone to Chongqing and cannot testify in person, the court ordered that the trial be adjourned until Han's own testimony arrives. The defendant was not allowed bail and was returned to custody. Judge Cao Jun then proceeded with the trial.</p>
<p>Chen Bohua</p>
<p>Chen is 42 years old, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and graduated from the Law and Commerce Department of Chizhi College. He served as Deputy Director of the Puppet Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Office, Counselor of the Puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, and Standing Committee Member of the Puppet Two-Road Special Party Headquarters. After the victory, he was reported and arrested by the Party Headquarters. However, Chen claimed that he was coerced into taking the puppet positions by "76," but later used this as a cover. He contacted Ai Guofan, who was a secretary and legal advisor at the Swiss Consulate, and constantly provided intelligence. He claimed that he had not committed any crimes endangering the country. The court ordered that, because Ai Guofan did not arrive today, a detailed investigation and summons would be conducted before a further trial. The trial continued at the original location in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Zhang Jingen</p>
<p>Zhang was a foreman and translator for the Japanese field warehouse and was arrested by youth league members at the Nanguo Restaurant. However, Zhang claimed that he had not endangered the local area, and designated lawyer Ge Zhiqin defended him. The court ordered that after the investigation is completed, a date will be set for sentencing. Court President Liu Yugui then presided over the trial.</p>
<p>Fang Zude</p>
<p>Fang served as a driver and translator for the Japanese military police in Wusong, and there were reports that he had used his power to seize civilian houses. However, Fang claimed that the rental of the houses was done through legal procedures and was not seizure. Because the accuser, Wang Deqing, did not arrive, the court ordered that the case needed further investigation and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that the traitor case of Zhang Yizhi and others will be tried tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Severance Pay for Workers in Japanese Factories; Supplementary Payments to Begin Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Unemployment Relief Association of the Ministry of Social Affairs, regarding the factories of Japanese enterprises taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, including 62 factories such as shipbuilding and machinery manufacturing, with 13,300 workers, the insufficient severance pay totaling 99,325,000 yuan, the funds have been temporarily borrowed by our government from Japanese businesses. It is reported that the association has now formed a payment group of 62 factories, and relevant agencies such as the Social Bureau, Police Bureau, and Municipal Party Headquarters Enemy Property Disposal Bureau have sent personnel to supervise the distribution. It is scheduled to commence at 8:00 AM this morning, jointly with Japanese businesses, to distribute at each factory. It is expected to be completed by the 18th.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Headquarters Plans to Assist Our Withdrawal of Japanese Nationals in China; To Date, 200,000 People Have Been Repatriated</h3>
<p>The U.S. Military Headquarters announced today that work to assist our country in repatriating Japanese nationals is being expedited. To date, a total of 200,000 Japanese nationals have been repatriated. According to a report from January 1946, a total of 202,031 Japanese nationals in Northern China, Shanghai, and Taiwan have been repatriated.</p>
<p>According to a report from August 15, 1945, there were a total of 3,505,782 Japanese nationals in China, Taiwan, Annam, the Three Eastern Provinces, and Hainan Island; 41,651 Taiwanese nationals; and 56,662 Korean nationals. Currently, the U.S. military is first...</p>
<p>The work of repatriating Japanese, Taiwanese, and Korean nationals has not yet begun. The work of assisting our repatriation of Japanese, Taiwanese, and Korean nationals back to their home countries will be completed by September 30 of this year. This is based on a detailed plan by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps. A total of 34 ships will be used to transport Japanese nationals back to their home countries, all of which are Japanese ships, along with 90 landing craft. Japanese sailors are still used on board. Currently, approximately 7,000 Japanese nationals are repatriated daily, and this can be increased to 10,000 next week. Starting February 1, it is expected to increase to 15,000 people. By July 1 of this year, the number of Japanese nationals repatriated daily can be increased to 25,000. Colonel Weitmon, Director of the U.S. Army Transportation Corps, stated that the ships repatriating Japanese nationals are all under the control of General MacArthur's headquarters. The U.S. Military Headquarters will be guided by MacArthur in the work of repatriating Japanese nationals. On the 15th of this month, MacArthur will summon U.S. military personnel responsible for repatriating Japanese nationals in Tokyo to give detailed instructions to accelerate the work of repatriating Japanese nationals. At the same time, major issues regarding the repatriation of Taiwanese and Korean nationals will be discussed. The work of repatriating Japanese nationals will prioritize the repatriation of Japanese nationals in Shanghai, Taiwan, and North China as the first basic plan, the repatriation of Japanese nationals in South China as the second plan, and the repatriation of Japanese nationals in Hainan Island, Vietnam, and the Three Eastern Provinces will be carried out after the first and second plans are completed.</p>
<p>Trial of War Criminals; Announcement of Postponement</p>
<p>The U.S. War Crimes Tribunal has completed all preparatory work for the trial of war criminals. As the order to begin the trial has not been received from Washington, the work of trying war criminals has been repeatedly postponed. Several U.S. military officers serving on the tribunal have also returned to the United States a few days ago because they have accumulated sufficient service points. The tribunal has repeatedly</p>
<p>indicated to the U.S. government, and has not received a specific response. Therefore, the trial of 51 Japanese war criminals and other nationalities of traitors by the U.S. military in Shanghai will not be carried out as scheduled.</p>
<p>Two Batches of Japanese Prisoners of War; About to be Repatriated</p>
<p>The tenth and eleventh batches of Japanese prisoners of war have been concentrated for inspection and boarded ships for repatriation in the past two days. The tenth batch totaled 3,266 people, and the eleventh batch totaled 3,239 people. The number of people repatriated next week will increase again. The authorities of the Japanese Prisoner of War Administration in the Nanjing-Shanghai area are considering whether the Japanese prisoners of war on duty in this city should be transferred back for centralized repatriation, or whether they should continue to serve and send back first the Japanese prisoners of war from Wuxi and Zhenjiang to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Water and Electricity for Enemy and Puppet Properties; All Fees Should be Paid According to Regulations; Nearly 3,000 Lease Mediation Cases</h3>
<p>After the surrender of the Japanese army, the enemy and puppet properties in this city were taken over by various agencies for use or allocated to personnel coming to Shanghai from the rear. However, it was found that these residences were all equipped with gas, water, and electricity. Therefore, the companies began to clean up to complete the transfer procedures and charge fees according to regulations. However, some military personnel, unaware of the regulations, often obstructed the company personnel. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters of this city specifically issued a notice yesterday to ban this and to pay the fees according to the regulations of the companies.</p>
<p>Pre-War Residents; All Can Move Back</p>
<p>According to the Housing Lease Management Committee of this city, the number of lease mediation cases handled by the office has reached 2,857 to date. Some have been resolved peacefully through mediation, but some have not been resolved after several mediations. As for tenants who left their houses due to the war and have never contacted the landlord to move back in the past eight years, the person in charge believes that regardless of whether the house is located in Nanshi, Hongkou, or West Shanghai and the city center, as long as the residents have taken refuge elsewhere due to the war and have not gone through the procedures for returning the lease, they can request to move back. If the landlord (first and second landlords) obstructs without reason, they can go directly to the mediation group on the third floor of the Housing Lease Management Committee, fill out an application for mediation form, and request a public ruling.</p>
<h3>More Than 400 U.S. Military Vehicle Accidents</h3>
<p>Regarding accidents caused by U.S. military vehicles in Shanghai, according to statistics from the competent authorities, from September 12 last year to January 10 this year, there were a total of 495 cases.

<h3>Drunken U.S. Sailor Holds a Sharp Blade; Stabs Our Military Police</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At 8:00 PM last night, a U.S. sailor named JK, under the influence of alcohol, was holding a sharp knife and walking north to south along Yunnan Road. In front of the isolation hospital, he encountered our military police Pan Fujin passing by. Unexpectedly, the sailor immediately stepped forward and stabbed Pan twice, hitting Pan's right arm, causing profuse bleeding. Fortunately, the police officers nearby held the perpetrator and took him to the police station, and sent Pan to the hospital for treatment. Pan is 19 years old, from Henan, and is a soldier in the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Busted on Jianguo East Road</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Recently, a large number of gamblers have been gathering on Jianguo East Road to engage in large-scale gambling. Yesterday, they gathered again at No. 49 Anshun Lane on the road to gamble, and put lookouts in the area of Caishi Road and Jianguo East Road. After pre-trial questioning by the Taishan Branch Bureau, the branch chief, Song Tingjun, personally led the judicial section chief, Jiang Shangpei, and police officers, detoured Lvbanc Road, crossed the gamblers' watch tracks, and went straight to No. 49 Anshun Lane, arresting all 55 gamblers, including the boss, Gu Lailin, male and female, and searched out various gambling tools. The branch bureau is currently trying the case and will send it to the district prosecutor's office for punishment in the near future.</p>

<h3>Letter from Mr. Chen Changtong</h3>
<p>Having just read today's Shen Bao and News Paper disclosing what I said yesterday about the new exchange rate issue, the section "The foreign exchange issue can be decided and announced after President Song returns to Chongqing" does not match what I said at the time. My personal opinion is only that it is necessary to decide the exchange rate as soon as possible, but the issue is extremely complicated and should not be rushed without full and thorough consideration. Moreover, this issue is extremely important and should be deliberated and decided by the highest authorities in Chongqing. I am hereby sending this special letter to request that you be kind enough to correct it. Chen Changtong respectfully</p>

<h3>Peng Xuepei Reports on the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Properties: Inventory of Warehouses Still Requires One Month; 83 Factories to be Put Up for Public Auction</h3>
<p>Mr. Peng Xuepei reported yesterday at a press conference on the "Situation of Handling Enemy and Puppet Properties in the Past Two Months," with a total of twelve points. This should allow the public to have a more concrete understanding of the handling of enemy properties. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee and Handling Bureau were established on October 29, 1945, and have been in operation for over two months. All handling of enemy and puppet properties is carried out in accordance with the "Measures for Handling Enemy and Puppet Properties" promulgated by the Executive Yuan. The handling of various enemy and puppet properties over the past two months is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Wharves and Warehouses</p>
<p>Warehouses are the hub of materials, so the takeover work is the most arduous. Moreover, the types and materials of the materials vary, and they must be carefully identified. The Jianghai Customs regularly dispatches more than 500 field staff, divided into groups. As of January 9, 247 units, totaling 769 warehouses, have been sealed and managed by the Customs. Among them, 127 units, totaling 469 warehouses, have completed the inventory of materials. The rest are being inventoried as quickly as possible, and it is expected to be completed in about a month. As for about 200 warehouses of Allied merchants and civilians, about half have been inventoried and returned to their original owners. The 136 warehouses of Chinese merchants and banks have been started to be sorted out, and the materials are being returned separately. The tonnage of the warehouses has been maximized by the Jianghai Customs to be vacated for the storage of materials when they arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Factories</p>
<p>According to the regulations on the handling of factory equipment, raw materials, and finished products, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is entrusted to take over. The ministry has taken over a total of 329 factories. In addition to 16 factories allocated to the Resources Committee and 20 factories to be allocated to the Textile Industry Management Committee, there are a total of more than 930,000 yarn spindles, 220,000 thread spindles, and more than 16,000 looms. Also, 11 factories have been allocated to the China Silk Corporation. A total of 83 factories have been decided to be put up for auction in two batches, and 115 factories have been returned. The handling of the remaining factories is being expedited.</p>
<p>Real Estate</p>
<p>It is stipulated that enemy and puppet real estate should first be used by government agencies and public enterprises. By the end of last year, 473 units had been applied for. Although government agencies have taken over a total of 616 units, the supply and demand are still difficult to meet due to (1) most receiving agencies are using the received houses, (2) some larger houses are borrowed by the US military, (3) civilian properties are being returned successively, and (4) the Japanese residential area needs to wait for the repatriation of Japanese before a large number of houses are vacated. It is believed that the number of enemy and puppet houses after the property rights are cleared is not very large, and it is not enough to alleviate the housing shortage if it is not used economically. Therefore, it was reported to President Song, who instructed: (1) Enemy and puppet houses shall not be used unless approved by the Executive Yuan for lease. When an agency approved by the Executive Yuan for lease uses the house, no agency shall refuse without reason. (2) Houses unrelated to military equipment, factories, warehouses, farms, and schools should be handed over for unified planning. (3) Military agencies and troops shall use the original enemy headquarters, barracks, and officers' residences, and vacate the ordinary houses they occupy. A portion of the aforementioned barracks and officers' residences should be reserved for the Garrison Command to provide temporary accommodation for transit officers and soldiers. (4) Municipal government agencies should make every effort to allocate and utilize the recovered local public properties and Municipal Council public properties. The district party headquarters, regiment headquarters, police stations, and defense corps should use suitable houses as a principle. (5) Central government agencies in Shanghai applying for houses should first ask their主管部会 (supervisory departments) to verify whether there is a need to establish an institution in Shanghai, as well as the staff size and housing budget, and allocate them accordingly. Furthermore, the utilization of enemy and puppet real estate is stipulated to be leasing and selling. Some agencies still believe that the government can allocate them without any fees, which is also one of the reasons for excessive applications.</p>
<p>Means of Transportation</p>
<p>A. Water transportation: The China Merchants Bureau has taken over about 250 ships in the Shanghai area from the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd., the puppet China Shipping Co., Ltd., and the puppet Inland River Shipping Co., Ltd. As for the ships previously taken over by the Naval Headquarters, except for 58 ships requested to be retained, the remaining 119 ships have begun to be transferred to the China Merchants Bureau for management. As of January 9, the Ministry of the Navy has transferred a total of 80 ships. In addition, the British Shanghai Dock Company was returned to its original owner on December 3. Also, 185 ships of Allied merchants and civilians and 33 ships of 15 domestic merchants and civilians have been returned successively. B. Land transportation: The Wartime Transportation Administration has taken over 130 trucks from the Huazhong Transportation Company, 20 trucks from the Yoshizaki Transportation Office, and 100 trucks transferred from the Third Theater Command, totaling 250 trucks. Regarding the passenger cars, the bureau is handling them uniformly in accordance with the resolution of the Review Committee. A total of 30 passenger cars have been returned to Allied officials and merchants.</p>
<p>Grain</p>
<p>As of January 9, the quantity of main materials received by the special commissioner's office of the Ministry of Food is as follows: a total of 5,607 shi of rice, 351,406 bags of flour, 6,823,384 jin of corn, 333,540 jin of broad beans, 82,124 jin of barley, 149,491 packages of wheat, 4,145,636 jin of sorghum, and 36,548 packages of grain.</p>
<p>Farms</p>
<p>In accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan, including sericulture, aquatic products, animal husbandry, epidemic prevention serum manufacturing, and cotton production improvement, which are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, a total of 50 units have been entrusted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for management, including 31 farms, 10 fisheries, 4 animal husbandry units, 2 cotton production units, 2 sericulture units, and 1 epidemic prevention unit.</p>
<p>Education and Culture</p>
<p>In terms of education, a total of 78 units have been taken over, including 10 universities and colleges, 5 research institutes, 1 library, 21 Japanese schools, 2 German schools, 2 puppet normal schools, 12 puppet middle schools, and 25 puppet primary schools. In addition, a total of 64 units have been taken over in terms of newspapers, including 8 newspapers, 5 news agencies, 7 radio stations, 11 printing and typesetting companies, 16 bookstores and stationery stores, 8 film studios, and 9 theaters.</p>
<p>Military Supplies</p>
<p>Military supplies are taken over by the Ministry of National Defense, airplanes are taken over by the Aviation Committee, and warships are taken over by the Naval Headquarters, including 21 gunboats with a total of 7,570 tons and 66 survey boats and transport boats with a total of 1,712 tons.</p>
<p>Trading Companies</p>
<p>According to the reports submitted by the Japanese, a total of 500 trading companies operated by Japanese merchants have been investigated. In addition to 208 companies taken over by the Central Trust Bureau, more than 200 companies are still under investigation. 47 units of German僑商 (merchant residents) have been identified, of which 14 units have been taken over by the bureau and are being sorted out, with Diefu and Bayer being the largest.</p>
<p>Investigation and Cracking Down</p>
<p>As of January 9, a total of 1,530 secret reports have been received and thoroughly investigated by dispatched personnel. Some of them were found to be untrue or repetitive. Those that were found to be true after investigation were quickly dealt with according to law. A considerable amount of materials has been seized successively. The important ones include 172,776 tons of pig iron, 1,337 pieces of cotton cloth, 4,661 taels of gold, 10.36 million 法幣 (legal tender), 5,245 boxes of western medicine, 44,656 boxes of soap, 10,534 bags of sugar, 425 newspapers, and the settled cases are now being evaluated and reviewed in order to issue secret report bonuses in order. However, due to the cumbersome evaluation procedures, as of the 9th, a total of 39 cases have been notified to receive the awards. The evaluation work has entered the right track, and the issuance of awards will definitely be accelerated from now on.</p>
<p>Price Stabilization</p>
<p>In order to stabilize prices, regulate the market, and universally supply various users, the bureau has successively sold sealed materials at parity prices. At the same time, in order to avoid strong stimulation of the market, causing prices to plummet and affecting production and social order, the method of gradually suppressing prices in batches and in stages is adopted. A total of 853 boxes of cigarettes, 2,155 boxes of soap, 1,823 baskets of matches, 606 boxes of洋燭 (foreign candles), 477 tons of ice eggs, 4,000 tons of ice fish, 3,200 dan of sugar, 8,000 市担 (market dan) of beans, 8,000 市担 of cooking oil, 600 tons of salted meat, 217 tons of pork and beef, 110 市担 of soy sauce, 800 pounds of seasoning powder, 20,000 dozen line socks, 40,000 porcelain washbasins, 1,498 bundles of newspapers, and 50,000 bolts of cloth have been sold (another 50,000 bolts have been shipped to Beijing-Hankou-Chongqing and 50,000 bolts to Tianjin). Recently, with the Lunar New Year approaching, the bureau has decided to supply a large amount of cotton yarn and daily necessities at parity prices to prevent market fluctuations.</p>
<p>Handling Procedures</p>
<p>The bureau strives to be cautious and thorough in handling various property rights and other cases, in order to avoid injustice. The procedure for handling cases is first investigated by the主管組 (department in charge). If necessary, the parties and witnesses must be questioned to clarify the entire case. Then, the department will sign its opinions and submit them to the legal counsel of each group for research, and then submit them to the Legal Counsel Committee for review. Finally, it is submitted to the Review Committee for review. For those with major connections, they must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. For example, the sale of factories must first be evaluated by the Evaluation Committee in order to be fair and appropriate, and must be repeatedly adjusted and coordinated according to market prices and price fluctuations. As for the issuance of secret report bonuses, the price must be evaluated after the investigation, and the evaluation must be reviewed, in order to seek fairness and reason. The above is a general overview of the work of the committee and bureau for more than two months. The matter is arduous, and omissions are inevitable. I hope that people from all walks of life will give more advice, so as to make up for the shortcomings.</p>

<h3>Armaments: Submarine Detector</h3>
<p>— Cong Zhi</p>
<p>During the early stages of World War II, the German U-boats (U-boat, German name is U-boot, which means Unterseeboot, meaning submarine) roamed the Atlantic, sinking many Allied warships and merchant ships; but they eventually disappeared, which was the result of the Allies' active sweep with "Sonoradio buoy." This secret has only recently been revealed.</p>
<p>The exploration methods of using radar or lookouts are certainly very effective for submarines that remain on the surface, but they are useless for submarines that hide under the surface. The "Sonoradio buoy" gives the plane "ears" to hear the sound of U-boats under the surface, measure their position, and track them. Once the enemy submarine's whereabouts have been detected, the aircraft can either attack it on its own or call nearby destroyers to destroy it.</p>
<p>The pursuing aircraft can also learn about the results of the entire attack from the "Sonoradio buoy," simply by capturing the underwater sounds. Sometimes you can even hear the propeller sound of the U-boat, which is the sound it makes when it flees from battle. Sometimes there is only a loud bang, followed by an unusual silence, which indicates that the U-boat has been destroyed.</p>
<p>According to Dr. John T. Tate of the US National Defense Research Committee, the "Sonoradio buoy" is the achievement of Group 6 of the committee. The research work was completed at the Navy's Underwater Acoustics Experimental Laboratory in New London, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Dr. Tate said: "The 'Sonoradio buoy' was not invented by an inventor who was accidentally inspired. It is the result of a group of trusted scientists and engineers in close contact with submarines in the Atlantic for a long time."</p>
<p>He said that the ideal of the "Sonoradio buoy" is not novel and unfounded. It is actually derived from a bulky, tethered buoy from the Naval Research Institute. That old-fashioned buoy was used to protect the harbor when it was impossible to lay underwater telephone cables. But it was a fresh idea to put this thing on a plane to participate in the submarine sweep.</p>
<p>This improved "Sonoradio buoy" must be lightweight in order to be loaded on airplanes in large quantities, have a low cost to meet practical applications, and have a strong structure to withstand the impact of waves. In addition, it must be powered by batteries for several hours and have the appropriate radio frequency and sufficient radio wave strength.</p>
<p>The plane exploring the enemy submarine first throws a "Sonoradio buoy" into the water. The buoy floats in the water, uses the underwater telephone microphone to collect underwater sounds, converts the sound waves into tiny voltage fluctuations, and then amplifies them in the transmitter part of the buoy and turns them into radio waves that are released into the air. The person on the plane who receives the radio can twist to the same frequency as the buoy's transmitter and listen to the sounds.</p>
<p>The listener can easily learn to distinguish between natural underwater sounds and extraneous underwater noises, such as the sound of a submarine's propeller. Once the personnel on the plane have detected the position of the underwater submarine, they can send a message to the destroyer base and immediately dispatch a ship to attack the enemy submarine. The plane can hover over the area and can follow the enemy ship closely, dropping "Sonoradio buoys" along the way to measure its position at any time.</p>

<h3>The Moon is Indeed Better Abroad</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>"The moon is also better abroad," I think this sentence has its truth, and there is no reason to satirize it.</p>
<p>A picture with a person or anything as the main body must be matched with a beautiful and appropriate background to bring out the beauty of the main body, which is a painting trick that everyone understands. If pictures are like this, how can actual scenes be different? For the景 (scene) of the 主體 (main body), whether in a painting or in an actual scene, in addition to natural clouds, mountains, and rivers, artificial embellishments are indispensable.</p>
<p>Abroad, a moon hangs on top of an architecturally artistic church spire, and the soft moonlight falls on a green, tidy lawn and a white, wide road; the trees on the side of the road are so well-trimmed and upright, and the scattered villages in the distance are so quaint and charming, coupled with blue sky, white clouds, distant mountains, and flowing water, the impression given to the moon viewer by this whole scene is undoubtedly beautiful and lovely, and at the same time, he feels that the moon is crystal clear and full, and the moonlight is extraordinarily quiet, beautiful, and poetic. Although the moon abroad may not have such a background everywhere, similar situations are probably very common.</p>
<p>But what about the moon in China? Can you find such embellishments as those abroad? Clouds, sky, mountains, and rivers are also available, but beautiful embellishments of churches, lawns, and other completely artificial and semi-artificial objects are difficult to find. At most, all that is available are those desolate cities, ruined battlements, Xiao temples, ancient temples, thatched huts, lonely boats, and even the graves of the dead, and a piece of叢莽 (untamed undergrowth). In this kind of situation, the moon will only appear lonely, bleak, and cold, giving you the feeling of desolation, sadness, and even horror. Compared with the emotions caused by the moon abroad—beauty and comfort—would you say "the moon in China is better"?</p>
<p>As for "fathers are also better abroad," that is an undeniable fact. Abroad, parents who have attended parent training schools (which is not a rare thing) certainly know better how to be a reasonable parent. Even those who have not received this special training, because of the high general level of education, have more open minds and can treat and educate their children with more reasonable attitudes and methods. Compared with the stubborn, autocratic, and ignorant parents of ordinary families and countries, would you say "the fathers in China are better"?</p>
<p>"Belittling one's own ambition and fostering others' power" is certainly undesirable, but why don't we eliminate the root cause of this "short-sighted" talk, and only obliterate the truth of this talk and argue back? Xi Yuan</p>

<h3>Notes on Attending a Moral Lecture</h3>
<p>— Xi Yuan</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where voices, colors, goods, profits, money, and drunken dreams abound, there is actually a moral lecture that is publicly lectured every week to promote morality and save the terminal customs, which is indeed a rare and valuable thing. This lecture is co-organized by the Confucian Society, Ningbo Association, Chongde Association, and Moral Society. The venue is at Cangzhou Shuchang on Chengdu Road. A lecture is given every Sunday morning, with about two or three hundred listeners each time. On December 30, I went to listen to a lecture, and I felt that I had gained some insights into self-cultivation.</p>
<p>There were two lecturers on this day: one was Yang Zhongyi and the other was Sun Xiangzhong. Yang's topic was called "The Way of Following One's Nature." The main points were first written on the blackboard, and the content was divided into two major categories: "性功 (nature merit)" and "命功 (destiny merit)": "性功" was further divided into four minor categories: knowing nature, preserving nature, nourishing nature, and fulfilling nature. "命功" was also divided into four minor categories: knowing destiny, awaiting destiny, having no destiny, and establishing destiny. This kind of study of the mind and nature is originally extremely difficult to explain, but Yang explained it methodically, which is indeed not easy. Sun's topic was "Upholding Truth? Seeking True Happiness." Eight characters were written on the blackboard: "賢親樂利 (virtuousness, kinship, joy, and benefit)" and "身心性命 (body, mind, nature, and life)." The general idea is that people in China who talk about 理學 (Neo-Confucianism) tend to focus on "honoring the virtuous and loving their relatives," and despise "enjoying their joy and benefiting their benefits." They only talk about the study of nature and life, and do not know the way of body and mind, that is, they only focus on the inner world and ignore external things, and inevitably fall into emptiness. In the future, they must be reconciled and not focus on one side, so as to conform to the truth and obtain true happiness. These studies are originally old studies, but Sun explained them in a way that promotes the old and creates the new, which is indeed admirable.</p>
<p>The lecture ended at noon. I hurried home, and along the way, I thought about this lecture. In this time when people's hearts are 　首敎 (something omitted/ unclear), it is indeed good. Therefore, I have a few opinions to contribute to the organizers. (1) The content of the lectures should not be biased towards old morality, but should integrate ancient and modern Chinese and foreign theories to create a new Chinese morality. (2) The materials of the lectures should not be biased towards the three religions of Chinese Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Any philosophy, ethics, psychology, art, aesthetics, etc. related to morality can also be elaborated. (3) In addition to adults, the audience must absorb young people from the Shanghai business community and school students. (4) Each lecture must be recorded and the systematic ones printed into a book for wide circulation. The above four points are the hopes I have put forward from the standpoint of the audience, which are very superficial. I wonder what the lecture authorities think?</p>

<h3>The Night of Discovering Atomic Fission</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>That day was the evening of January 25, 1939. The weather was very cold, with strong winds. That night, at Columbia University in the United States, physicist Dr. Dunnin split the uranium atom for the first time, and for the first time invented the release of atomic energy.</p>
<p>Gusts of cold wind blew from the Hudson River, disrupting the ivy on the walls of the school. That morning, students were taking major exams, wrapped in scarves, going in and out of the Pupin Physics Laboratory, worrying about Physics 213 (Thermodynamics) and other physics courses. That morning, Dr. Dunnin's colleague, Dr. Fermi, had visited Dunnin, and the two discussed science and scientists. Because an assistant instructor had just returned from Princeton University, saying that the Danish physicist Bohr had come from Europe, and before he left, he heard that Dr. Hahn in Berlin had discovered barium and several other medium-weight atomic elements, which, after emitting neutral electrons with radiation, were found in the waste residue of the split uranium. It is said that Dr. Hahn said at the time, "As a chemist, once I see　, I know what it is; as a physicist, seeing this phenomenon, I simply don't know how to explain it." In fact, it is just the heaviest element that becomes a lighter element after fission. In this process, atomic energy is released. Although everyone thinks this is very simple now, it was indeed a novel and difficult thing at the time. Dunnin and Fermi were very interested in the problem of atomic energy. They had a machine that could measure this energy, so they discussed it: which is more suitable for experimentation, liquid uranium, solid uranium, or gaseous uranium? They went to lunch together and continued to discuss this issue during lunch. Fermi was going to Washington that afternoon to attend a scientific conference, and the two had not yet decided what material to use for the experiment when they parted.</p>
<p>Dunnin spent that afternoon pondering this problem in his office. By six o'clock, he braved the wind to go back, still unable to figure it out. He had dinner with his wife in the apartment. As dinner was coming to an end, he suddenly thought that it would be best to experiment with solid uranium. So he braved the wind and rushed back to his office. He put down his coat and hat and went straight to the laboratory in the basement. It was just after seven o'clock, and he began to organize his machine. The machine was simple: it was a clip with a substance that emits radiation, a container with a substance that is bombarded, and a seismograph that records the energy emitted after a substance is bombarded by points and lines displayed on a screen. (Ordinary uranium emits radiation that only shows dots on the screen when it is not bombarded.)</p>
<p>Dr. Dunnin placed a thin piece of uranium in the clip, put a mixture of beryllium and radium as a radiation emitter in the container, and after slightly adjusting the instrument, began the experiment. At this time, there were two other scientists in the laboratory: Dr. Buehler from Columbia University and Dr. Slack from Vanderbilt University. The two were wearing white coats because they had just conducted nuclear physics experiments and were busy cleaning up some instruments. Dr. Dunnin, however, was wearing a brown suit. All three thought that the experiment was unlikely to succeed. However, when Dunnin moved the radium clip to the radiation place, green wavy lines suddenly appeared on the screen of the seismograph, as if jumping straight from the screen. "Ah!" Dunnin said, "Is this really real!" Bu and Shi walked over together and were extremely shocked when they saw these amazing lines. Dunnin had some doubts in his heart. He said that there must be something wrong with his machine. Bu and Shi argued with him. Bu shouted, "Haven't you used this machine for several months! You know it's right." Shi also shouted, "This machine can't be wrong!" The three wanted to check whether the machine was accurate and decided to put a piece of cadmium in the place where the radiation passed. The property of cadmium is that it cannot transmit radiation. When they released the radiation again, all the lines on the screen of the seismograph disappeared. They used many more tests, and by nine o'clock, Dr. Dunnin, with a solemn expression, admitted that the release of atomic energy had actually been realized.</p>
<p>The three agreed not to reveal this secret for the time being. Dunnin returned to his office alone, the howling north wind raging outside. He studied alone for three full hours, calculating how much energy each atom released just now. His conclusion was that the atomic energy he released that night was about 120 million to 200 million volts. Such great power had never been dreamed of by mankind in history.</p>
<p>It was almost midnight, and Dr. Dunnin casually put aside the numbers he had calculated, left his office, and went home, pondering in the cold wind. Bao Zhongzuo</p>

<h3>Question of Nationality</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongzuo</p>
<p>According to a report by the famous American columnist Winchell: One day after dinner, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin were chatting and asked each other what nationality they would like to be if they did not belong to their current nationality. Churchill said: "If I were not a Briton, I would like to be an American." Roosevelt said: "If I were not an American, I would like to be a Briton." Stalin said: "If I were not a Soviet citizen, I would feel ashamed."</p>

<h3>Spending Money for Japanese Prisoners</h3>
<p>— Qu Shen</p>
<p>Newspaper reports: "The Japanese prisoners of war and officers in Zhejiang Province have stated that given the current situation of their country, all Japanese officers and soldiers should work hard and be self-reliant and not want to add to the burden of the country; all the pocket money issued will be returned and not accepted." On the other hand, the Japanese prisoners in Beijing are the opposite, and they have already　　　　　　　accepted what we have sent. Our Ministry of Military Administration sends pocket money to Japanese prisoners, which is to treat them preferentially; they dare not accept it, isn't that not appreciating the favor? In fact, this is the expression of their patriotism. We must be vigilant ourselves!</p>
<p>The price we paid for this victory was extremely high. Although it is called victory, it is full of devastation and the people are living in misery; all of our people should strive to build a new China in a positive way, and save as much as possible in a negative way, and not　　make unnecessary extravagance: one less expenditure is one more income.</p>

<h3>Sino-Belgian Radium Hospital Urgently Needs to Be Taken Over by Our Country - Reader's Letter States Inside Story</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: This has to be considered a great regret! We have been fighting the war for eight years, and we have won the victory for a full four months. I don't understand why the health authorities have neglected this only "Sino-Belgian Radium Hospital" in our country! Let its white body still be covered with a gray coat! The funding for the Sino-Belgian Radium Hospital was established with the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity, which is public funds, and its nature should be a hospital that seeks welfare for everyone, but in fact it is the opposite, because it is controlled by foreigners, and it invisibly shows that it has a special meaning, The hospital's medical fees are set at the highest, and the income and expenditure are not made public. The salaries and benefits of the Chinese employees serving in the hospital are extremely meager. However, the treatment of several foreign nurses is superior. Recently, the medical director commissioned by our Chinese standing committee was squeezed out and almost unable to continue working. The patients in the hospital are all Chinese, and there have been no doctors to see patients for more than ten days!</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: Please imagine, our country has suffered all kinds of hardships in this war, isn't it to cleanse the past humiliation and recover all sovereignty? This hospital should of course be returned to our country, how can we let foreigners control it again? I have always admired your newspaper as the mouthpiece of the people, so I ventured to draft this letter in the hope of borrowing a corner of the page to make it public to the public, so that the authorities will pay attention and take it back as soon as possible, so that its white body will be covered with a sacred coat, the country is fortunate, the people are fortunate! I wish you good health. Luo Zhijing</p>

<h3>Inquiry about Scholarship Procedures</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: Please reply to the following question in a corner of the newspaper. I have always been a scholarship student of Newspaper A (high school). During the summer vacation of this year, I went to Tunxi to study. After the victory, due to the high tuition fees and other problems, I rushed back to Shanghai to continue my studies, but the scholarship from Qingbao had expired and I did not apply to receive it. This semester is about to end, and my family's economic situation has not improved, so I plan to continue to apply for a scholarship. I don't know what the procedures are? Is skipping one term treated as a new student? I hope you can publicly answer in detail. Reader Cheng Jinyu</p>
<p>(Answer) The scholarship students of this year have all passed the qualification examination. The student did not participate, so they cannot enjoy the treatment of old students according to the rules. However, we express our deep sympathy for those who are poor and unable to go to school. For the next scholarship, this newspaper has decided to cooperate with the Shanghai Education Loan Committee. In the future, you can apply to the committee. For detailed information, please pay attention to the news in this column.</p>
