<p>〔中央社北平十七日電〕杜聿明將軍身體已恢復健康，惟尙不能過分操勞，現以東北軍務亟待處理，十八日銷假飛　。十七日在平杜氏招待記者時，解答各種問題。謂國軍現由四平街向北推進，進行接收工作，但隨處遭遇共軍阻撓。據報，共軍在四平街以北公主嶺，駐有大兵，準備會戰，該處係林彪所指揮之共軍精銳，預料國軍將在該處遭遇頑强之阻撓。現在共軍已攻人長春，該地情勢當甚緊急。到瀋後，第一步工作，係在領土完整，主權完整之原則下，迅速展開接收工作。又謂共軍在東北之兵力，據不完全之報吿，正規部隊的有三十五六萬人，非正規部隊的有十五六萬人，共軍有各種輕重武器，原爲日軍所有，日軍在東北之武器甚多，均落共軍之手，以瀋陽兵工廠一處而論，即有槍十五六萬枝，東北執行小組希望能順利進行，但爲保持主權完整，領土完整，應先接收後調處，接收之後，一切政治問題，不難解決。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十八日電〕軍息：（一）十七日十八日兩日長春共軍攻擊益烈，我守軍在慘重犧牲下，退據市區中心大同廣塲，中央銀行，警察局，電業公司數建築物內。官兵咸抱最大決心，繼續抵抗中。（二）十八日共軍竟砲學中央銀行電業公司，並用燃燒彈，致使多處起火。（三）共軍兵力三倍於我，並携有中型戰車四五輛，駕駛員砲兵射手，均爲某方將校，其砲兵戰車，當爲某方所供給者。（四）共軍首領爲周保中曹禮懷張慶和等。（五）十六日蘇方飛機一架，在長春市區低空飛行。（六）四平街至公主嶺八面域之鐵路公路，均在共軍積極破壞中。</p>

<h3>何應欽談遣送日俘僑　剩餘六十萬人六月底遣送完畢　對長春被困國軍必設法解倒懸</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日專電〕今日下午三時，何總司令在記者招待會席上報吿：（一）陸軍總部負責人送日俘日僑使用之港口，計十二處。現靑島·連雲港·厦門·汕頭·廣州·海口·基隆·高雄等港，至本月底可結東，祗有上海塘沽兩港口，須待山西及長江中部日僑俘輸送完畢後方才能結東。現時山西之日僑日俘，每日可由火車運出三千人。截至本月十八日止，陸總已運走日俘八十萬五千五百五十一人，日僑八十萬九千九百三十二人。剩餘日俘日僑六十萬九千餘人。由於中美雙方努力合作，可望於六月底遣送完畢。（二）在華韓人原有六萬五千三百六十三人（東北不在內），現已送回一萬二人，其餘月內可送舉。韓人上船可帶行李二百五十磅。（三）台胞已明令恢復我國國籍，惟前在日軍中服務之台人仍應集中，曾任敵人間諜或有助虐行爲者，須依法辦理。（四）韓台人產業之處理已由行政院會議決定辦法五項，辦法已公布。（五）關於徵用日籍技術人員。查聯合國原決定各戰塲日人應全數遺送回國，故應即行集中，開始遺送。至各軍事機關，根本無留用或僱用日俘之規定。前已徵用者，係屬徵服勞役性質，自應遣回。（六）東北日俘日僑之遣送，美方已決定於四月廿五日開始。其使用之港口，爲葫蘆島。至東北日俘日僑人數，因東北尙未完全接收，無法統計。大約有一百三十三萬人。（七）關於戰爭罪犯，在重慶設有戰犯罪犯處理委員會，曾擬定軍事法庭之組織，由軍委會命令各地成立軍事法庭，專任審理戰犯事宜，計已設立者，有：南京·無錫·台灣·徐州·濟南·衢州·太原。北平·漢口·錦州·廣州等十一處，在南京已逮捕者，有廿五人，較重要老有酒井隆內，田孝汀（日軍第七十師團長），中島信一（日京滬區特務機關長），酒保寺德次（日海軍中佐）。據各地報吿，已逮捕之總數爲九七零名。</p>
<p>對長春局勢</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕今何總司令會答復記者下列之詢問。（一）問：國守長春之數千孤軍，爲維護國家主權，保衛人民生命財產，致瀕於絕境，國人現極關心此輩忠勇健兒之安全。政府旣不主張以傘兵或共他方法增援，究將採取若何措施，以挽救若輩厄運？答：聞馳援長春之新一軍已到達公主嶺附近，共軍現扼守公主嶺，正以種種方法，阻擊國軍均如報載，但政府對長春市內軍民及接收人員之女全，極爲焦慮，自必採取妥善方法，解此倒懸。（二）問：津浦綫臨城棗莊之煤礦現狀，平漢綫安陽附近之共軍態勢，隴海東路之通車日期，有無報吿？答：棗莊煤礦曾協定共管，但因共軍尙未撤退，故未解決。津浦綫臨城附近鐵路雖已修復，但未接軌。隴海平漢兩綫均有此現象，此因共軍對恢復交通一事，尙鮮誠意。（三）問：「自新軍」之名義現尙存在吾？答：偽軍投誠後，最初曾改稱爲「自新軍」，嗣經陸軍總部裁遣，此一名義不復存在，祗有素質較佳極少數之「自新軍」，爲暫維偏僻地區之地方治安計，暫予縱隊名義。</p>

<h3>安理會討論兩大問題　昨臨最緊要關頭　前日會議波提議與西班牙絕交　傳英勸弗朗哥立即辭職</h3>

<p>〔美國新聞處紐約十七日電〕今日下午安全理事會重行開會後，波蘭代表蘭琪立即提出反對弗朗哥政機之控訴書，指斥該政權嚴重威脅世界和平與安全，蘭琪並發表冗長演設，提出文件敦促聯合國立即與西班牙斷絕關係。略謂：弗朗哥藉軸心國軍事之助奪得政權，此全非西班牙人民之意志，故弗朗哥政權實爲聯合國之公敵，弗朗哥且會以炸藥等物資，協助軸心國作戰，此舉實非普通之商業來往，乃含有政治作用，是即協助軸心國對聯合國作戰是也。弗朗哥旣以各根據地供給軸心國使用，復曾協助日本襲擊珍珠港，凡此皆可視爲軸心國之非正式與國，故弗朗哥政權非僅西班牙之內政問題而已。法代表龐納立即贊成波提議。據稱：西班牙現行局勢之繼續存在，將「威脅世界和平」。西班牙爭辯逾三小時，至晚間始休會。龐納表示法國已準備採取進一步之行動，對西班牙實施經濟制裁。墨西哥代表亦繼法代表之後，表示贊同波蘭之動議。荷蘭代表克里芬斯及美代表史退丁紐斯反對干預西班牙內政，但兩代表均斥責弗朗哥政權。史氏稱：此項問題，須由西班牙人民本身決完之。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十七日電〕安全理事會今晚舉行第三十四次會議，埃及代表亞飛飛繼郭泰祺任主席，致開會詞，並向郭氏熱烈致謝。亞飛飛於會後宜稱：理事會討論西班牙問題時，其所牽涉之原則較之事實尤爲重要。此項原則即聯合國機構對於任何國家，是否可因其國內情形足以演化而危及國際和平，遂出而加以千涉。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫教十八日電〕此間消息靈通方面人士認爲英國已向西班牙政府提出非正式建議，要求該國獨裁者弗朗哥應立即辭職。英外部已不再隱諱其對西政策，其要旨乃在推翻弗朗哥而不致使西班牙落入共產主義之手中。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十八日電〕安全理事會昨散會之先，蘇代表葛羅米哥建議於復活節星期五照常開會，巴西代表首先忿然起立反對，美，英，荷，代表亦均迅速表示反對，結果議決於今日召開會議後，延至假期後再行復會。</p>

<h3>因總統選舉法問題　法三大黨發生破裂</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十七日電〕國民制會議本日開會時，三大政黨爲總統選舉法問題，發生重大破裂。緣大會憲章小組委員會曾提出草案，規定法國總統當由國民制憲會議以三分之二多數選出之，投票必須公開，如接連三次投票不能獲得三分之二多數，選舉即當延期，或依照同樣原則，規定經由五分之三多數選出，以代替三分之二多數。當選總統任期七年，連選僅能迎任一次，本日會議席上，人民共和運動黨對此提出修正案，主張總統須由國民制憲議會及聯邦行政院聯席會議選出之，並須獲得絕大多數，社會黨與共產黨表示反對，當經提付表決，結果以二八九票對二六四票，否決此項修正案。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十八日專電〕足以拯救數百萬飢餓日人之「原子能糧食」，刻已在此發明，關於原子能之軍用控制權，正激辯不休之時，日本科學硏究所硏究員榎本竟能使原子能作爲建設性之用，此一鳴驚人之舉，似爲一諷刺之對比，椱本之發明，係起於廣島之被炸，渠認爲太陽爲原子能之已知最大來源，陽光不斷照射於地面，及佔據地面大部份之海洋，故海洋必爲原子能之最大儲存所，渠之研究，即欲自海水中，發明可食之原子能，又因魚類曾飽飲海水，故又計劃利用魚類製造，渠以魚骨，混以橘皮及馬鈴薯之皮，使其當於維他命。椱本將此等混合物嚐試後，口稱「味美」。原子能糧食之製造，無須稀有而昻貴之原料，因魚骨等價廉而又隨處可得，然椱本對此發明仍謙稱，並不滿意，渠仍在繼續改進，欲將其所含之熱量於每單位中，自八百個加洛里增至一千個加洛里。</p>

<h3>如何規定工資？</h3>
<p>最近社會一般人士，都在憂慮中國工業前途沒有生路，其一部分原因固由於外滙牌價使輸入洋貨的價格遠較國價爲廉，中國工廠勢必大受打擊，而大部分原因却多注目於風起雲落的工潮。不獨工商企業家紛紛議論，眼看有苦干外國廠商預備由上海遷往香港南洋甚至遷往日本，也有些躍躍欲試，恨不得追隨遷廠，即平素和工廠無關的一般人看見工潮澎湃，本來或許有心投資實業，也因此裏足不前。這真是中國工業之不幸，也是中國社會之不幸。窮其所以致此的緣故，勞工紀律的廢弛，工作效率的低落，均足以使管理工廠者深覺工業秩序的無法維持，因而推測中國工業品將不能與洋貨競爭於市塲，遂大减其投資實業的興趣。此外，則紛紜擾攘的要求增加工資問題，亦爲工商界大感頭痛的一端。</p>
<p>我們姑舍一般勞工紀律間題暫且不談，先來討論這個似乎複雜而實在簡單的工資問題。關於工資問題，最近有許多提議，一是規定最高工資，一是規定最低工資，一是希望統一工資，一是主張調整底薪。衆說紛紜，莫衷一是，而工資問題於是更見第複，實則剝繭抽蕉，說穿了都未見中肯。試爲分論如次</p>
<p>規定最高工資的目的，在於防止工人無　的要求，藉以穩定成本，穩定產業，俾得與洋貨相競爭，簡單的說，意在維護資方合法的利益。規定最低工資的用意，則在於防制資方對職工過度的剝削，舊以保護勞方應得的利益，與維持其適當的生活水準。這兩種目標，驟然看來，可稱完全相反，然而今日却竟會同時發生，可見其原因必別有所在。說穿了都是因爲物價太高所致。惟其物價太高，所以工人生活困難，不得不要求最低生活的保障。然而產業界也惟其因爲物價太高，成本太貴，對內銷路减退，對外不易出口，又無法與廉價的洋貨競爭，致危及其生存之基礎，也就不得不迫切呼籲，要求工人諒解，增加工資的要求總得有一個最高限度。雙方看來，都覺得自己一方面持之有故，言之成理。</p>
<p>因爲雙方理論，都有根據，都是事實，而且基於同一事實，所以就常理論，除掉雙方互讓互助，以期共同打破難局，渡過難關而外，其實找不出其他的捷徑來，可以同時滿足雙方的願望。如果單靠法令，無論規定最高工資，或規定最低工資，我們認爲在目前都是無濟於事的。故解決勞資糾紛中的工資問題，還得根本從穩定物價着手。</p>
<p>須知此項工資，無論是最高或是最低，都不能不以相當穩定的物價爲出發點。照現在物價那樣動盪不定，其漲風如果依然漫無止境，則今日所見爲最高或最低的，過了一二個月以後，便將失去其原來的意義，從而又須重行調整，以期適合此最高或最低的限額。此限額一天不能確定，便是最高最低工資，也必一天無法確定。換句話說，根本上，在今天的物價情况下，我們還沒有方法可以得到固定的最高或最低工資。</p>
<p>於是有人主張：普遍地適用生活費指數，一律拿底薪來作爲最高最低工資的基礎，以代替固定的工資數目。照此辦法，如果能獲得統一工資的結果，自可避免上述的困難。但又將發生下列諸問題：</p>
<p>（一）此項底薪是區域的，還是全國性的？</p>
<p>（三）此項底薪的制定，應用何種手續？</p>
<p>倘屬全國性，則公務員本有底薪，無須另行制定，顧何以各地的倍數不能劃一？又何以不拿生活費指數來，作爲按月升降的標準？倘或公共機關無法實行，却强令私人事業普遍適用，求其統一，究竟是否合理？</p>
<p>區域的底薪，自然比較單純。但在同一區域以內，我們也已見到許多公共機關所採用的標準並不一律。甚至一般人認爲持遇獨優的，如中紡公司之類，聽說他們也同樣還在要求提高。那末，究竟怎樣的工資標準，才算最高或最低？</p>
<p>而且無論是底薪，是工資，倘須規定數目，命令遵照，按理必須經過立法手續，才能生效。工業先進諸國所訂的最低工資法，都先由議會通過，然後由政府公佈施行，這便是一個很明顯的例子。我國立法院，現在還沒有制定最低工資法，更談不到最高工資法。那末，全國性的工資法，今日確還沒有根據。倘或由各地方來制定單行法，是否應由各地的參議會來担荷這個責任？假如僅由地方政府用命令來規定，算不算合法？　依據上項理論，所以對於統一工資這一點，我們在立法的觀點上就不無疑問。至於事實上，如照某一部分人的希望，勉强要做到同業同酬，乃至異業同酬，無異大履小屨同價，也恐怕太近理想。本埠最近，已有許多例子，證明同一個業中，强令做到同一待遇，必定遭遇到很嚴重的困難，而事實上終於行不通了。倘要更進一步，硬想辦到異業同酬，其結果如何，似乎不難想像！在這工商各業，杌隉不安之中，我們總覺得首先應注重的是安定，首先要辦到的也是安定。從安定中纔可望生存，纔可望進步。凡是已發生工潮的，應該急求解決；還沒有發生工潮的，總不宜再加撩撥或挑動。所稱統一工資，如果傎要辦到，也無非在這如火如茶的工潮中，再加上許多薪，潑上許多油而已！這斷不是枚平工潮的辦法。</p>
<p>至於調整底薪，我們認爲有兩種看法。一是提高生活水準，一是恢復戰前水準。如果屬於前者，那是另一問題。我們先得問在月前這種生產情况之下，工作效率如此降低，洋貨傾銷日益劇烈，一般人的生活水準能吾馬上提高，明眼人一望而知。如果屬於後者，那末，「調整」這兩個字，根本就不狠確切。因爲恢復戰前生活，無論此時提此要求是否合理，縱然認爲必須辦到，亦只須根據戰前工資，再乘以生活費指數即得，用不着多費心思另行調整。一經另行調整，便有故意提高或抑低的作用在內，已失去了原來恢復戰前水準的意義。所以在這個意義上，我們認爲只須查定底薪，用不着調整底薪。底薪是事實，是根據，是基礎，而不是理想，更不是杜撰。只須拿出簿册單據米，公同加以審定，無所用其爭執。倘有爭執，仍須用其他的簿册單據來佐證，依舊不適用主觀的見解。最近流行的調整底薪，或估定底薪，或將戰前底薪加二·五倍，然後再按照生活費指數來遞爲升降，這些辦法實在都不免畫蛇添足，爲了想敷衍遷就以求苟安，反而因此播下了許多麻煩糾紛的新種子！</p>
<p>總而言之，無論是底薪，是生活費指數，這都是解決工資的工具，並不是解決工資的根本辦法。根本辦法，依舊在勞資雙方的情感和諒解上。所以，上海市社會局吳局長前曾主張，按照工廠法的規定，推行工廠會議，我們認爲這不失爲解決工潮的一個途徑。但也須附帶一個不可忽缺的條件，就是勞資雙方都傎誠爲着工廠發達而參加會議，萬不可在會議中，同床異夢，尤其不可因有此種會議而剝奪了工廠管理的職權。這已非屬於工資間題的範圍，今天姑不具論。</p>

<p>— 本報記者邁天</p>
<p>在飛機裏面，請了一位年輕漂亮能幹的小姐來招待乘客，請述沿路風景等等，這在中國還是一件非常新鮮的事。我們還找不出一個合適的名字來稱呼她們，暫　　她們「空中小姐」吧。</p>
<p>「空中小姐」選擇條件十分嚴格，才貌雙全，舉止態度工作一定使人滿意不必說，先看她們的制服，就稱得上「漂亮之極」。棕色呢的「夾克」和短裙，配着棕色皮腰帶，棕色半高跟皮鞋，沒有翻領的「夾克」右襟用兩粒金色扣子搭在左襟上面，右肩下綉着一只銀色飛機，左袖肩旁綉中航公司標記。這樣的服裝，看去比美國女兵的制服要美麗得多了。</p>
<p>負責訓練班的主任是季萊。他採用美國的方式同樣來訓練中國小姐。投考員要經過體格檢查，智力測騐，還要能說國語，廣東話和英語。錄取以後的功課也相當費力，訓練時期規定二個月，她們必須習讀航空史，中航公司的歷史，組織和路綫，中國的地理，海關及移民規則，學習救護，服務規則，熟識飛機設備構造和應用方法。她們還要被帶到龍華機塲的修理問和各部門去實地講授。</p>
<p>這次計劃招考的小姐，一共四十位，第一批訓練出來的人，將在港滬綫上服務。訓練好的有九位，她們已經飛行過六次，以後每月要飛行八十至一百小時。第一名合格的「空中小姐」是何倍黛小姐，她已經在上星期二飛重慶的機中開始表演她的工作了。</p>
<p>「空中小姐」還有一點很要緊的條件，就是必須是不滿二十六歲未婚的小姐。滿了二十六歲後，她們就不能再飛了，要調任地</p>
<p>「空中小姐」將不但在空中活躍起來，帶給乘客們不少便利，而且爲中國多發展了一椿新的事業。（圖爲正在服務之何小姐）</p>

<h3>當局舉辦米貸期間　米價不平反漲　採辦程序值得考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米浪貸款，自經當局核准舉辦後，來源漸暢，市價應可漸平，不意前日暴漲三四千元，昨晨又升一二千元，頗出一般人意料之外，據業中人解釋謂：由於貸款實行，各產地以爲奇貨可居，紛紛報漲，致牽動本埠市價，但亦有人稱，有一部份商人在本埠河下就近爭相授購之故，申請米貸之商人，前已核准十七家，聞以抵押品限於道契及銀行担保兩種，多數行家不易承借，正在聲請變通中，又荳米行業公會，爲求普遍獲益，及擴展來源起見，尙在請求當局，無限制放款云。</p>
<p>昨日米市早晨开盤再漲一二千元，午時以消化不振，下降千餘元，與昨相比，略加三五百元，麵粉以滬淞幫另化尙可，價續升一二百元，黃豆亦加三五百元，豆餅早挺午懈，價形平平，生仁穩定之勢，芝蔴站立，麩皮挺秀，苞米堅定，紅糧胃呆，仍居下游之勢，油價以來貨接連，依然不振，再疲千元，糧價暫看產地上落為轉移。</p>
<p>據糧政當局方面消息，日來本市食米又起波動，純屬投機份子掀風作浪，現滬地存米甚豐，且洋米不久可源源進口，食糧當無處缺乏，此後倘發現有不法糧商，在市場煽動情事，查明即予依法嚴加懲處，並已商由警務當局協助監視，又據米業消息，本週內將由大宗食米運抵此間，大致在二萬石以上，此項食米，一部份係由米商採辦，一部份係由糧政當局採辦。</p>
<h3>美鈔買氣仍盛金價過程平靜</h3>
<p>烚赤昨市况平穩，持有者逢高仍多了結，美鈔堅俏，金市頗多套買，人心亦因時局較緊，似形向榮，以致求供均衡，過程多盤，查晨開已穩，開後一度趨堅，在一五六萬左右盤旋，中行配售價依然不變，惟高價不能久支，存多陸續推出，漸漸下降，午前回挫至一五三萬，午後初時小疲，退至一五二萬，最後仍平，結果與前收相較，微升一萬，銀種飾金十六萬八，紋銀一千六，銀元一〇五〇元有賣，暗拆銀根更瀘，業中日拆息價祗一角二分至一角四分，遠期者一角五六分。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔洋行方面仍有結進，業中存貨不多，不易搜羅，自晨初二〇五〇元逐漸步升至二一〇〇元，入後金市稍疲，漲勢被阻，午刻在二〇八〇元光景，套頭再軋攏至七四〇元對十兩，午後形勢仍穩，結果較前收續昇三十元，港票形勢稍穩，結果老貨好起三元，新貨五元，美匯指定銀行對做二〇二〇元，賣價稍升爲二〇六〇元，紗花結款較多，港電羅比仍穩。</p>
<h3>公債黑市沉寂華股繼續小挫　外股因春假休業</h3>
<p>公債經前日警局千涉後，昨日於理應稍歛跡，並無多大活動，僅統丙略有游擊式之黑市讓受，市價的在五五〇〇元左右，雜牌寂然，華股繼續小挫，晨開後始終屈居賣風之下，惟過程極爲平庸，午前最低永紗四八〇〇元，美亞四〇〇〇元，景福四〇八元，午收稍定，次熱新光勤興中途雖疲，午刻形勢反易拉高，結果永紗美亞景福三熱較前收續見微跌，新光勤興升降俱微，中法新亞內衣平穩，餘者均告軋跌，各元老股平平，午後永紗微升為四九〇〇元，美亞四一二〇元，景福四二〇元以上，交易有限，外股因西曆清明，操業者仍沿舊習，春似休業三天，昨市並無正式公開成交，塲外黑黑市因持有者有所讓受，喊價較前收稍跌。</p>
<h3>紗市堅穩　現棉交易頗暢</h3>
<p>昨日紗市甚為穩定，廿支高級貨如雙馬等牌，因粵帮進胃不旺，殊少進展，廿支小型紗有京蕪來客選辦頗殷，故價好起一萬之譜，綜觀各廠廿支現貨供應仍不充足，故人心頗爲堅定，似有一時不易大跌之現象，紡建昨開售棉布三十種，美墨布十七種，今日照例開售棉紗。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉報跌七至十六磅音，計近期美金二七·四四，遠期二七·五五，米特林現貨二八·〇三，本埠現棉市况仍平，惟交易又轉起色，緣紡建公司接收日商之紗廠需用原料孔亟，突又暢辦米特林彭家坡巴西花等二千六七百包之巨，此外民營紗廠及同業均存觀望，未有舉動。</p>

<p>昨食糖又屆標售之期，價格升降互見，計中砂白三千包，四萬四千元，升一千元，如數售通，四半軍白，蔴袋莊七萬八千元，廣包莊七萬六千元，三半車白五萬八千元，均有成交，未售通，生砂一千包，仍四萬二千元，中砂劃盤上午爲四萬四千七百五十元，至四萬五千元，下午四萬六千元，北市另售四萬六七千元，號盤開出靑糖四萬三千元，油包無稅單者四萬元。</p>
<h3>陳茶仍無起色</h3>
<p>陳貨紅絲茶，交易迄鮮生色，尤以祁門茶，高莊貨缺乏相當受主，中檔者已降叩八萬元邊，而疲風猶濃，至於新龍井等，客方不忍輕脫，市價未見低落。</p>
<h3>美國燒碱定貨八月方可裝船</h3>
<p>昨日燒碱因有散戶脫售，市價回小，月牌每桶三十六萬，美貨每桶二十九萬元，其他凡士林為每磅七百元，白臘廿一萬五千元，純碱每袋五萬五千元，小蘇打每袋四萬五千元，白油每磅五百元，三角甘油二十九萬五千元。美貨燒碱，曾由馬尼剌轉到三千桶，但該地已限制出口，凡出口者必須領證，而從美國直接裝來，則據某洋行昨日接到紐約國民化學廠電訊，謂須至本年八月份方可裝船。</p>

<h3>物價蚊帳於國外出口業無法經營</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕關於進出口業之困難情形，據中國進出口貿易協會副總幹事王世顏表示，目前出口貨完納出口稅，係照民國二十三年公布出口稅則辦理。納稅標準，爲百分之五及百分之七五兩級，另繳一城附加稅，統按出口時之平均躉發市價，照規定稅奉核計，在海外市塲有希望之出口貨，如豬鬃·桐油·生熟皮·蛋品·大豆·子仁均須納稅。此種物品在戰時曾因結滙關係，免予征稅。現政府因官訂滙率旣已廢止，原列結滙物品之免稅規定，遂宣吿無效。外滙市塲開放後，二個月來，由於物價狂漲？出口貨產製購運城本，按現行滙率折算，大部已在國外市賈之上。桐油約高一成，腸衣約高三成，牛羊皮的高一倍，繭絲的高一成，茶蛋二項亦祗高不低。出口商對於輸出，業已無法經營。政府如不加以設法獎掖，出口事業將遭遇完全停頓之危險。</p>

<h3>教部定五月一日起　渝地停止收發公文　陪都酌留部員協助教育復員</h3>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕敎育部長朱家驊氏日前來京，連日公務繁忙，頃記者往訪，承吿敎部復員情形，大要如下：抗勝之初，敎部未整個遷京，爲隣近省市敎育事宜接洽便利起見，曾以浙閩蘇皖贛等省及京滬兩市公文，直接由京部辦理。餘由渝辦理。現在敎部已作整個遷京準備，定自五月一日起，所有全國各省市敎育應局公文，一律應呈南京敎部辦理，渝地對外不另行文。惟因交通運輸關係，文卷檔案，能否如期運京，尙屬問題。而陪都並酌留部員，協助各校各敎育機關進行遷還及復員工作，輪船船位及飛機機位，雖由交通界爲敎育方面特予助力，給予三分之一的坐位，但還都人多，船機位有限，各校與各敎育機關，恐須遲至秋冬之間，始能完全搬淸。（愚）</p>

<h3>國民大會教育代表　蔣建白返國</h3>
<p>戰時奉命派駐緬印　最近在美攷察敎育</p>
<p>〔大華社訊〕國民大會敎育界代表蔣建白氏，前奉電召，由美返國出席，業於日昨搭輪抵滬。按蔣氏於抗戰之前，在滬軸弼潘公展氏，主持敎育行政，夙著政績。軍興而後，即奉敎育部命，任該部駐滬專員，在敵僞强力壓迫之下，維護敎育命脈於不替，厥功至偉。廿九年秋，敵僞系之益急，被迫赴渝，奉命轉赴滇黔諸省，視察敎育文化，並致力各該省戰時敎育文化之督導與推進，曾召開各省敎育會議，奠定戰時敎育之基礎。</p>
<p>駐緬</p>
<p>三十年夏，復奉敎育部曁僑務委員會之命，派充駐緬甸敎育專員，於督導華僑敎育之外，復從事僑胞之組織聯繫工作。是年冬，日軍偷襲珍珠港，發動太平洋戰事，繼即進攻緬甸，蔣氏即於烽火連天中，與曾養甫王芁生諸氏發動組織南洋華僑救濟協會，一面救濟僑胞戰時生活，一面組織並訓練僑胞，協助抗敵工作。旋復誘導組織緬甸抗敵協會，我國僑胞及緬甸最高行政當局一致參加，殊有助於抗戰工作之推進。嗣日軍抄襲滿德里，蔣氏身陷重圍，遂親冒鋒鏑，率同緬甸要人，輾轉返渝，僅以身免，備受中櫃當局之嘉獎與撫慰。</p>
<p>駐印</p>
<p>由緬返國以後，時為三十一年夏，復奉命為派駐印度專員，同時又為敎育部駐印代表，指導印度敎育文化，辦理中印文化溝通事宜，對於當地華僑敎育之整頓，學校設施之改進，致力允多。並手創華僑印度中學，爲全印第一個華僑中學，由此深獲僑胞之愛戴。</p>
<p>駐美</p>
<p>駐印二年，至卅二年夏，奉調駐美，視導在美華僑教育，並攷察美國敎育。在美二年曾遍歷全美重要都市，兼及鄕村，對於美國敎育過去設施，及今後趨勢，均作精密深刻之攷察。對於中美文化合作，尤多致力。曾獲芝加哥市教育局之協助，撥給值價八十萬美元之土地卅餘畝，在僑胞集中居住區域，建築運動塲及各種房舍，爲華僑敎育文化及健康活動之中心，實爲美人協助華僑之創舉。此外對於祖國抗戰功蹟之宣揚，美人援華工作之策進，貢獻尤多，曾作公開演講百數十次，而於儒胞敎育之督導，僑胞感情之聯緊，亦莫不悉力以赴，備著勞績。</p>
<p>返國</p>
<p>蔣氏於公餘之暇，復就哥倫比亞大學教育學院，專攻教育行政與職業敎育，使卅年來從事敎育之實際經騐，與最新教育理論，能融會貫通，硏究所獲，至爲豐富。旋以國民大會開會期近，奉電遄歸，將以敎育界代表資格出席大會。記者昨曾趨訪蔣氏於其寓邸，據談在滬勾留一週，即將赴京，一面向國大報到，一面向敎部述職云。</p>

<h3>澄衷巡禮</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>沉寂了八年的上海市的塘山路，現在又有節表的鐘聲按時傳到耳邊來，原來葉澄衷先生手劍的澄衷中學已經復校了。</p>
<p>澄衷在過去早已蜚聲社會，有着光榮的史蹟，可是經過「八一三」砲炎的洗禮，大量的圖書，儀器和其他教育設備，全被敵人毀壞凈盡了。吳校長焠倫就借重慶路新寰中學校舍，權行上課。閱五月，遷北京路通易大樓；規模粗具，學生驟增。而吳校長亦因積勞成疾，於民三十年間盡瘁而逝。是年冬，敵日是猖獗，孤島陷落，王震公光生受校董會之命，繼長澄衷，堅守崗位，獨樹一幟。教職同人，含辛茹苦，堅貞不屈，始終顯出了澄衷的精神。</p>
<p>河山光復，日月重明，塘山路舊校中但見頹垣殘壁，荆棘滿地。經王校長與諸校董策劃籌措，勉力進行，卒於一月內，修復房屋三十八間，使中學部得以先行復課。記者於前火去參觀，適在下午課後。進了校門，便見許多靑年，荷鋤負箕，汗流滿臉地在鋤平操塲，很是勤勞。塲東北的世美堂，創痕斑斑，頽廢甚劇。後面懷德堂，僅存一個不整齊的門面。校門正面，仍舊巍然聳立着葉澄衷先生的銅像。而像後由本報贈送的刻着「寸陰是惜」的鐘，僅剩破碎的水泥柱了。蒙墨堂正在修理，圖書館已經開放，好多學生正在自修，讀書空氣顯得十分濃厚。就是遊散在旁的局學，也都活潑有禮，絕無滬上一般靑年的浮囂習氣。東邊的澄廳，原來是體育館，已折斷了二根樑，最後面的厠所，非常整齊淸潔，可是東首的廚房前，仍是滿目凄凉的一片！</p>
<p>前天是澄衷立校四十五週年紀念日是，可是那佔地廣達四五十畝的校舍，經過八年長期的摧殘，就祗剩下道一些了！堂邑的武訓學堂，已在山東省政府的努力協助下復校，上海當局，想亦必能體念國家獎勵興學之意，而積極予以扶助的。但是澄衷的校友們是應該更努力地去爲母校爭光，把澄衷過去堅貞不屈的威武精神，運片至母校復興建校上去！</p>

<h3>台灣人與內地人</h3>
<p>— 四月十二日航訊　本報台北特派員暮時</p>
<p>記者來台省，爲時已整整的一個月，足跡遍台北台中各地，所接觸的不只是內地和當地的　識份子·士紳·靑年·商人，而是各階層的人物，這些時間裏，蘊藏在每個人的胸懷和吐訴於口的，都是同一個論調，這個論調是基於作僞過渡時期的不長進或許有點倒退的現實而起的。</p>
<p>一般地說，本省人和內地人之間，發生着莫大的隙痕，露骨的說就是反感，表現在紙面上的是一種跡近於謾駡和議刺於性台灣式的文句，表現在行動上的，則是原始的粗野的舉措。所以要用台灣式的，爲了他們都用着似通非通的日本化文字，和侵略主護者的手法，來表達他內心的滬求和詛咒。他們在本省人之中，掀起了反感的波濤，而在另一方面，却又看到他們對台省要求從速建設的熱誠。這個嚴重的現實，我們不能不信實他會引起日後的若干惡果，但是我們却又不能不深信這暗潮的澎湃，會成僞政府施策的主要阻力。</p>
<p>反感·歧視·阻力</p>
<p>和上海的情形正復相似，這裏也正閙着本省人與內地人的糾葛。在時間的距離上，本省人是處於日本人的壓迫之下已經五十一年，他沒有可以保障的人權，處處受到拘束，勝利後，他們突然被解放了。在空間的距離上，他們沒有嗅到自由民主的空氣，他們沒有理解抗戰中國的實情，被日本人的「大東亞」宣傳政策所朦蔽了。在四十歲以下的靑年，他更沒有和國人作着深度的廣泛的接觸。在突然被解放上，一面是護得了自由，一面却又表現得放浪形骸；而對國內的不理解，一面對日人發生戀戀不捨的情緒，一面却又因現實的不能十分美滿而惹起了反感，這種現象，我們不能說它並無變態，相反的或許是必然的狀能態吧？</p>
<p>由於放浪形該，使內地人看不順限，由於反感而發生歧視，妬恨，因果的促成之治安的不良，工作進程的遲滯和社會風尙的急轉，這是可怕的現象，在衡量上，它要比上海人與重慶人嚴重得多。</p>
<p>觀念方面的錯誤</p>
<p>在觀念上，本省人和內地人都有錯誤的地方。從上海，福州，重慶渡海來的軍人。大小公務員和漏綱的商人船家，到台灣來似乎抱有征服者的心情，他們以爲抗戰才把他們解放過來的，不妨採取高壓的較偏的態度，在待遇上給內地人以較優，在精神上給他們以慰藉。若千更存有發洋財掘金礦的念頭，他們說，我們　洋過海，以生命作孤注，還本是爲名爲利？在「奴化」了的台灣，日本人走了以後，還不是我們的世界？</p>
<p>本省人對於內地來客，多少存有搶地盤敵飯碗的心理，他們以爲台灣人的對日抗爭，始終在努力着的，即在抗戰時，也盡了最大的力，流了大量的血汗。光復後，應當還給台灣人，由台灣人自己來耕耘種作，不應當讓內地人來「坐享其成」，即使是抗戰，也只是盟邦美國的協助，而不屬於中國軍民的。（據一個內地上校的報吿。）他們强調着「台瀾未曾奴化」，（台灣民報的社論）在日人以殖民地政策統治時代，表面上捧出日　「一視同仁」的「聖旨」，自始便制定「六三法案」，賦與總督以壓迫台灣人的特殊　限，可是台灣人仍不屈於威武，發行刋物非難和辯駁，更進而組織團體，和日警員發生過不少次的衝突，延續數十年。他們甚至對「壓榨」的含義也表示反對，說是日本人的殖民地的缺乏自立性的經濟施策，不盡是「壓榨」。（一個台灣士紳的話）。</p>
<p>行動方面的表現</p>
<p>在行動上，由於內地人的不能盡如人意，也是促成反感的主因。不能圓滑運用的統制和封鎖政策，使往日過着較低的生活的本省人在缺少配給之外，更增加了高度物價的負組，尤其是米糧，以產米之區的台中大平原，也因高昻的米價，使升斗細民不能安定的生活着而發生意外，即在台北也因微購軍糧，軍民發生了不幸事件，而過往能配給到的肥料，又以運輸關係不能供給。被接收了的工廠，礦地，學校，銀行都在長期停頓的整現狀態中，一般的日僑產業和敵產的貼封佔據，又常表現着紊亂，缺乏計劃，缺少步驟，行政工作的效率，不能顯著地敏捷地表現，加以像高雄軍警以千涉看白戲之類的槍傷事件，和嘉義要賣分局長周必璋受賄十萬元台幣，以及宜蘭市某科長發日僑歸國證每張五萬元等層見迭出的貪汚案件，這些過渡時期的混亂現象直接間接給本省人以精神和物質的感受，使他們不能忍耐，不能領受，不能長此持續下去。我們沒有證據，可以確定日本人是否在幕後策動，但在治安的不能確保和竊盜風行上，當局已發現了他們是有組織的不法搗亂行爲。</p>
<p>在生活習慣和思想行動上，內地人似乎是看不惯本省人的。一般的，他們有着較日本人更濃烈暴露的島國民性，氣量小，不樂於交際，衣飾不整，女人們則粗陋的脚，缺乏美感，不像從內地來的會化錢，愛漂亮。和內地人少接觸，不能運用語言來表達，這些隔閡，也常常發生着誤會。內地人說：他們愛日本人的堅毅苦幹，日本女人的溫柔有禮，但是不愛台灣人。</p>
<p>必要的心理建設</p>
<p>由於本省人和內地人的反感，部份的却由反感而變成惡感。本省人在對內地人有一點共通的，遇有不滿，就會集證的攻擊你，這種原始鬥爭的方式，在另一面，是刀殺和槍殺。被派到台南的內地人，能勇敢地到鄕村去的現在還不多。而在內地人集中的台北，情形好得多了，但實令本省人下鄕追繳稅牧，還是胆寒的。　這種因歧視而發生的現象，這祗是暫時的過渡的，但我們可不能忽略它所給予的影響。期望於目前當局的，只有在政治的物質的建設之同時，加强心理建設。抱着不認眞的和歪曲了觀念的能態度，來處理台灣的政事，實難望其好轉。而本省人的自我建設，和中華民族固有精神和一埠德的發揚，確是更必要的。我們都需要目責，沉着，不必苛於責人，苛求於表現。</p>
<p>陳長官訓示僚屬說：「人的彈性極大，只要我們努力工作，必有良好的成績。吾則，不但我們的敵人要笑我們，連我們的盟友也將看不起我們！」深信陳長官及其僚屬一定能有良好的成績表現的，更能爭取本省六百萬民心的！</p>
<p>於吳港內之日本小型艦船，已由駐日盟軍炸毀，目的在使頑敵僅有之作戰力完全歸於消滅。</p>
<p>上圖·台灣省行政長官公署外景。</p>
<p>這是台省的最高行政機構的長官公署，主張「司令部以外不准用門崗」的陳儀長官，每人駐在三樓辦公。這裏所屬的敎育處，秘書處，工礦處等，都在一起。它控制着全省各縣市的政治，文化，經濟的命脈，它是建設新台灣的大本營。</p>
<p>下圖。台灣舊總督府外景。</p>

<p>蘇聯設計部長伏茲納生斯基，向蘇聯人民，指示對新五年計劃應有之貢獻。伏氏稱：「吾人毋忘壟斷性質之資本主義足以產生新侵略者。爲防止新侵略，則侵略各國必須完全解除武裝，受軍事經濟控制。聯合國機構中必設一機關，監護國際和平與安全，並足以維護和平，防止侵略。蘇聯之戰鬥部隊，必須充實實力，必須不斷配以最新式現代武器。蘇聯軍事及經濟潛勢力，亦須以充實」云。伏氏更就蘇聯月標臚舉如次：首先復興砲火摧毀區域，使工農業恢復戰前水準，然後使之大加擴充。新五年計劇，着重於恢復及擴充重工業。僞欲使每年鋼鐵產量超過四千五百萬噸，蘇聯擬造煉鋼廠四十五所，展鐵廠一百零四所，並將在西伯里亞及烏拉爾建造大規模新廠。西伯里亞達東部份將自開鐵鑛，大部鑛區即將從事勘測，以便開採，約可得商業鐵砂十六萬八千萬噸，（其中一萬萬噸在西伯里亞西部）及猛砂一萬萬一萬噸。銅產計可增加一·六倍，鋁產增加一倍，　產增加一·九倍，鉛產增加增加二·六倍，鋅產增加二·五倍，　　增加四·四倍，鉬產增加二·一倍，錫增加二·七倍。煤產擬較戰前增加百分之五十一，遠東維勒耶及赤塔兩區處女煤礦均將從事開採，可得一萬萬八千三百萬噸，此外並將大事製造煤氣，火油提煉，均將在還東庫頁島等處進行，務使遠東工業發展，能追及南部。蘇聯預計至一九五〇年商業火油備藏數量，可供兩三年之用。同時、並注重增產高度辛烷汽油，一九五〇年底，可以造成煉油廠四所，及煉油設備十大處。水力發電廠恢復者大所，新造者三十所，即可落成。另有八所第一部份已開工，五大新廠，則已動工建造一九五〇年機器製造量亦將加倍。是年可出機動軍五十萬輛。人造橡膠產量已加倍，汽車胎增加三借，橡膠鞋底亦已增加一·三倍。新五年計劃吿成時，人造橡膠啻佔總數百分之三十八。房屋建築，注重工人住宅，每年所造的佔地四百萬平方公尺。（聯合社，莫斯科，十六日）</p>

<h3>「愛」與「美」</h3>
<p>— 宋壽呂</p>
<p>「愛」與「美」這兩個名詞，是人人所了解而也是最動聽的。不論誰沒有一個不知道愛，也沒有一個不喜歡美的；這種愛的心理現象和欣賞美的能力，敢說是一般所共同具有。兩者間的關係，在作用方面說來，很有一種關聯性，因此惹起多數人的誤會，以爲：凡是可愛的，終一定很美，美的也一定可以惹人的愛。其實不然，愛與美好像相似，却有很大的區別。</p>
<p>依從美學上和心理學上的說法，愛的起因是由於趣味，美是基礎於美感。我們要愛某人或某物，必須先與該人或該物發生了一種美感，那未才會感到趣味而惹起愛的熟情。美是存在於物象的外表，愛是起於吾人的內心。然而美有時並不表現在外表，却蘊藏於內面，如學問，才幹·品性等等，這種美都非等到表現出來，才能發覺。所以愛多帶主觀性而屬於個人的，美則多帶客觀性而屬於一般的，二者不能混爲一起。我們要對於愛與美來加以區別，可以定這樣的一個界說：美並非完全即是愛；愛不是完全即是美。而一部分的美，可以說就是愛；一部分的愛，也可以就是美。美常能惹起人們的愛，愛是常由於美而發生的。</p>
<p>如一般所謂美人，這美人的評價完全因了各人的美感而變換，不一定美人就能够受到全人們的愛，不美的人也許會受到人們底愛的。人們也有知道這人美却並不愛，也有明知道這人不美而反愛她。俗語有句話：「情人眼裹出西施」，便是這個道理。所以美固然能够惹人的愛，却也有因着愛而覺其更美的。</p>
<p>如果更進一層來討論愛或美的是與否，人們對於美感旣然不同趣味，那末就不能够批評誰的愛是對，誰的愛是不對，或者誰所愛的是美，誰愛的是不美。</p>
<p>譬如：有的人愛看平劇，有的人愛看話劇，有的人愛看電影，這幾種娛樂各饒特殊的趣味；我們決不可以說誰的娛樂適當，誰的娛樂是不適當；或者那一種娛樂是美，那一種娛樂是不美。又如：有的愛聽西樂，有的愛聽國樂，愛聽西樂的人不能妄斷國樂爲不美，而他底愛的適當，愛聽國樂的人也不能因了他的不愛西樂，就認定西樂爲不美。</p>
<p>總括以上所述，可以拿兩句話來作一個結論：美是因各人的美感而不同，愛是因趣味而惹起的。徐蔚南</p>
<h3>美汪亞塵書畫</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>曾經有個笑話，說近來我國的畫家，一走到外國，便畫中國畫；一回到本國，就畫西洋畫。因爲外國人不懂得中國畫，而我國人不識西洋畫的，於是不論山外，大家說他畫得好就是了。</p>
<p>現在中國畫范開展覽會的汪亞塵先生却沒有照上面笑話那麽做法。他在法國臨摹學習的是西洋的歷代名作。還到到中國後，他放棄了畫布，而更深刻地硏究中國畫了。他在國內所展覽的，十之九是本國畫，尤其是仙的金魚爲一般入所愛好。大家所認識的本國畫，要製作得為大家所愛好，自然是有原因的。像在先生的畫魚，他在無錫一帶，確然硏究了妤多時候的魚的坐活。</p>
<p>中國的字，原始是象形，換言之是圖畫，所以有書畫同源這句話。就是到現在，我認爲中國寫字之所以成爲藝術品，也就是因爲寫字是等於畫圖這個緣故。我們寫字，就是將字典裏的字來畫像。况且我們的畫學，是重神似而不重形似的，所以字也以草書較楷書爲重視。只是寫字這種畫圖工作，比了畫花卉人物更難表現。因爲寫字只是線條約配合，而且只是一種顏色的運動，字要寫得好，叫人看了覺得純熟而不油腔，覺得生動而不板滯，實在不易。我國的有識之士常常說，字寫好了，學畫便容易。這倒是實在的。因爲中國畫以線條爲基本，寫字正是中國畫的基本練習，正如木炭畫是西洋畫的基本練習一樣。</p>
<p>在先生書法也有其特色，一如其圖書。現在他的書畫一起陳列着。我們要知道他的畫法如何，以其書法來印證，便可一無遁形的。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（二八）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>墨老爺如今倒沒有什麽煩惱了，他明白自己的生命像風燭，已經臨近了滅亡！所以，他反倒能寗靜地承受着病患的磨折，他在期待着一個永恒超脫的安息！</p>
<p>墨太太自從那天晚上挨打以後，本想第二天就實行報復，用最大的力量，還　墨老爺，可是墨老爺的病使她不能履行她的決心。因此，她一直還深深地委屈着！她甚而爲了要發洩這口氣憤，希望墨老爺快些好起來，以便她可以和墨老爺嚴重地拚一塲。總之，她絲毫沒有憐憫墨老爺的意思，更談不到關懷。她爲了目尊心的傷損，已經許久不再去找翁二太太了。同時她的忿怒，還不曾平息，所以只有常常在孩子們的身上發作！</p>
<p>如今墨太太僞了麗華過分地愛護墨老爺，她已經不太喜歡她了。她每次想到這裏，就懊惱！自己生的兩個孩子，沒有一個向着自己的。因此，她把感情轉移給了麗雲。對於這，孩子們並不知道嫉妬，而且麗華反倒高興，因爲有麗雲陪着墨太太，她更可以有充分的時間去侍候墨老爺了。同時，翁二太太有了新的寄託，漸漸和墨太太疏遠起來，這也是讓墨太太牢騷的一點。</p>
<p>麗雲差不多天天都在墨家。其實她倒不是爲了墨太太，而是爲了麗華。她和麗華的友誼，幾乎超過了墨太太和翁二太太的友誼。她雖然很野性，但非常聽從麗垂的話，麗華敎她乖；敎她念書；所以她愛麗華，也敬重麗華。麗雖在她的小心坎上，佔着極重要的地位，爸爸和媽所給她的印象很漠然，都是無可無不可的，而地却不能沒有麗華。</p>
<p>忽然，有一天麗雲拿着一封信哭哭啼啼地到了墨家。墨太太和麗華都很詫異，以爲翁二太太打了她，或則是她闖了什麼禍，於是墨太太連忙問她：</p>
<p>「什麼事這麽傷心呀？小雲！是誰欺侮了你？吿訴我，我去替你出氣。」</p>

<h3>Du Yuming Flew to Shenyang Yesterday; National Army Positions in Changchun Shrinking, Situation Very Critical</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Military news: Northeast Security Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming has now arrived in Shenyang. Air transport to Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan has been strengthened. Furthermore, Northeast Security Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liang Huasheng has already crossed Sipingjie and is personally leading 2,000 elite troops from the New First Army, advancing towards Gongzhuling. It is reported that Gongzhuling is approximately 50 kilometers from Changchun, and 20,000 Communist troops are holding it. A major battle is expected there.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 17th] General Du Yuming has recovered his health, but he should not overexert himself. However, as Northeast military affairs urgently require handling, he has taken leave from sick leave and flown [there] on the 18th. On the 17th, Mr. Du held a reception for reporters in Peiping, answering various questions. He stated that the National Army is currently advancing north from Sipingjie to carry out the takeover work, but is encountering Communist troops obstructing them everywhere. It is reported that the Communist troops have a large force stationed in Gongzhuling, north of Sipingjie, preparing for a decisive battle. This location is defended by the elite Communist troops commanded by Lin Biao, and it is expected that the National Army will encounter stubborn obstruction there. Currently, Communist troops have attacked Changchun, and the situation there is very urgent. After arriving in Shenyang, the first step is to rapidly commence the takeover work under the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty integrity. He also stated that the Communist military strength in the Northeast, according to incomplete reports, is 350,000 to 360,000 regular troops and 150,000 to 160,000 irregular troops. The Communist troops possess various light and heavy weapons, originally belonging to the Japanese army. The Japanese army had a large number of weapons in the Northeast, all of which fell into the hands of the Communist troops. Taking the Shenyang Arsenal as an example, it alone has 150,000 to 160,000 rifles. The Northeast Executive Headquarters hopes to proceed smoothly, but to maintain sovereignty and territorial integrity, the takeover should be carried out first, followed by mediation. After the takeover, all political problems will not be difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 18th] Military news: (1) On the 17th and 18th, the Communist troops' attacks on Changchun intensified. Our defending troops, with heavy casualties, retreated to the city center, the Datong Square, the Central Bank, the police station, and several buildings of the electricity company. Officers and soldiers alike are determined to continue resisting. (2) On the 18th, the Communist troops even shelled the Central Bank and the electricity company, and used incendiary bombs, causing fires in many places. (3) The Communist troops outnumber us by three to one and have four or five medium-sized tanks. The drivers, artillerymen, and gunners are all officers from a certain [foreign] party, and their artillery and tanks must have been supplied by a certain [foreign] party. (4) The Communist leaders are Zhou Baozhong, Cao Lihui, Zhang Qinghe, and others. (5) On the 16th, a Soviet aircraft flew at low altitude over the Changchun city area. (6) The railways and highways in the area between Sipingjie and Gongzhuling are all being actively destroyed by the Communist troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 18th] After several days of fierce fighting, the isolated army in Changchun's outer perimeter strongholds are gradually shrinking. They are now only holding the Central Bank and the Post Office as strongholds. Contact with the outside world was still made via radio on the morning of the 18th. According to authoritative sources, the final fate of this isolated army will be decided on the evening of the 18th and the morning of the 19th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 18th] A telegram from the besieged Changchun states: After twelve hours of intense fighting, most of Changchun has fallen into the hands of the Communist troops after the National Army fiercely bombed the Communist troops. The telegram stated that the National Army is continuing to bomb the Communist troops.</p>
<h3>Marshall Arrived in Chongqing Yesterday from Peiping; Negotiations with Both Sides to Begin Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 18th] Special Envoy Marshall and his party departed from Peiping by plane at 10:30 this morning and arrived at the capital's airport at 2:40 this afternoon. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Zhou Enlai, and other important members of the Nationalists and Communists were present to greet him. Mr. Marshall then received reporters for a short time. Mr. Marshall stated: He will immediately devote himself to solving the Northeast and China problems. The hope for peace in China has been strengthened. Until he has spoken with all parties, he naturally cannot make any statements about the overall situation. His trip to China from the United States was safe, but Washington was extremely busy, more so than at any time since the beginning of the war. After arriving here, Mr. Marshall did not wish to explain the results of his trip to Washington, nor did he wish to elaborate on China's developments before speaking with representatives from various parties. He only stated: He will immediately consult on the overall situation in China, paying particular attention to the large-scale civil war in the Northeast. It is expected that Mr. Marshall will rest for one night and begin a series of meetings with officials from the American Embassy and leaders from the National Government and the Communists tomorrow. When asked how long he will stay on this return trip to China, Mr. Marshall said: "I do not yet know, it will depend on the situation." After disembarking from the plane, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall were taken by Madame Chiang Kai-shek in the same car to a private residence in the suburbs for a short rest, before returning to their former residence in Yiyuan. Journalists gathered outside the gate to wait. Mr. Marshall spoke briefly, and smiled as he entered, saying: "I hope the meetings don't start tonight." Mr. Marshall's primary task is to renegotiate the ceasefire order and end the fierce fighting in the Northeast. His secondary task is to get the Nationalist and Communist leaders to reach an agreement on government reorganization and troop consolidation. Political observers here expect the Nationalists and Communists to quickly reach a ceasefire agreement, as all parties know that the National Government and the Communists are eagerly awaiting Mr. Marshall's arrival to find a suitable agreement to "save face." Reliable military sources say that although the civil war situation in the Northeast is serious, it is not impossible to resolve peacefully as long as both sides are sincere in their efforts.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 18th] General Marshall flew from Peiping to Chongqing by plane at 10:30 this morning, accompanied by Mrs. Marshall and Lieutenant General Gillem. After arriving here from Tokyo last night, Mr. Marshall immediately listened to reports from Minister Robertson, General Gillem, and Brigadier General Beall, the head of the Executive Group of the Mediation Executive Headquarters, on the developments in China during Mr. Marshall's absence. Mr. Marshall paid particular attention to the Northeast situation.</p>

<h3>Hubei Provincial Government Plans to Establish a Large-Scale Power Plant</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 18th] Before the establishment of a large hydropower plant in Wuhan, it has been decided to establish the Wuchang Power Plant, which has been agreed upon by the Resources Commission and the Hubei Provincial Government. An order has been placed with the United States for a 5,000 kW generator, of which two 500 kW generators have already been shipped to Shanghai and will be shipped to the province by the end of this month. 1,000 kW of electricity can be generated by early July, and two generators can also be shipped within the year. In addition, there are plans to build a large-scale power plant outside Wuhan, with a capacity of 50,000 kW, to make Wuhan a major industrial area.</p>
<h3>We Have Ordered New Types of Rickshaws from the United States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Diederichs, 16th] A representative of the Diederichs Rubber Company, Haber, said today: A certain company formed by a number of Chinese industrialists plans to order three to five million new types of rickshaws in Diederichs. These new rickshaws are equipped with newly invented power rubber springs from wartime to replace the old copper leaf springs.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Returns to China from the United States; Our Request for Food Aid Was Not Successful</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 17th] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Chinese Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and 30 staff members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, are scheduled to fly to Shanghai tomorrow aboard a Pan American World Airways "Constellation" aircraft. Among them are transportation and public health experts, surgical dentists, X-ray technicians, veterinarians, housing experts, accountants, industrial architects, and radio experts. According to Jiang Tingfu's statement to the press today: I came to the United States to request a steady supply of food on behalf of China, but I must admit that the mission I was entrusted with has failed. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has reduced the quantity requested by China, and the Anglo-American-Canadian Joint Food Committee has reduced it again. Our request for 500,000 tons of fertilizer resulted in only 10,000 tons. The United Kingdom is also unwilling to provide China with surplus rice from Siam due to political and economic reasons. India is also suffering from famine. India is China's neighbor, and we do not want to take from others by force. What we are asking for is fair consideration, and we hope that Mr. Hoover, Chairman of the American Emergency Food Committee, or other international delegations, will go to China and India for on-site investigation and decide on the allocation. I cannot help but shudder at the sight of Americans wasting good food. I fully agree with President Truman's statement that half of China's 450 million people are undernourished. Hunan, which was originally a rice-producing area, now has 16 million people who are about to starve to death. Those who say that Europe's daily ration is maintained at 1,500 calories are unaware that China's daily ration averages only 850 calories. If Europe's ration were reduced to the current standard in the Far East, there would be no famine in the Far East. At the same time, if the United States can reduce to the European standard, no one here will go hungry at any time. If the United States were to give up eating rice until the end of December, no one would suffer from hunger.</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Discusses Sending Away Japanese Captives and Residents: Remaining 600,000 to be Sent Away by the End of June; Assuring Efforts to Relieve the Besieged National Army in Changchun</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 18th] At 3 PM today, Commander-in-Chief He reported at a press conference: (1) The General Headquarters of the Army is responsible for using twelve ports to send away Japanese captives and residents. Qingdao, Lianyungang, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Haikou, Keelung, Kaohsiung, and other ports can be completed by the end of this month. Only Shanghai and Tanggu ports need to wait until the Japanese captives and residents from Shanxi and the central Yangtze River area are transported before they can be completed. Currently, 3,000 Japanese residents and captives can be transported out of Shanxi by train every day. As of the 18th of this month, the General Headquarters of the Army has transported away 805,551 Japanese captives and 809,932 Japanese residents. There are more than 609,000 remaining Japanese captives and residents. Thanks to the joint efforts of China and the United States, it is expected to be completed by the end of June. (2) There were originally 65,363 Koreans in China (excluding the Northeast). Now 12,000 people have been sent back, and the rest can be sent away within this month. Koreans can bring 250 pounds of luggage on board. (3) Taiwanese compatriots have been clearly ordered to restore their Chinese nationality. However, Taiwanese who served in the Japanese army should still be concentrated. Those who have served as enemy spies or have engaged in abusive behavior must be dealt with according to the law. (4) The Executive Yuan's meeting has decided on five measures for the disposal of Korean and Taiwanese people's property, and the measures have been announced. (5) Regarding the requisition of Japanese technicians. The United Nations originally decided that all Japanese in all theaters of war should be sent back to their countries, so they should be immediately concentrated and start the repatriation. As for the military agencies, there are no regulations for retaining or employing Japanese captives at all. Those who were previously requisitioned were for the nature of conscripted labor and should be sent back. (6) The U.S. has decided to start the repatriation of Japanese captives and residents in Northeast China on April 25. The port used will be Huludao. As for the number of Japanese captives and residents in Northeast China, it is impossible to count because the Northeast has not been completely taken over. It is estimated to be about 1.33 million people. (7) Regarding war criminals, a War Criminals Handling Committee has been established in Chongqing. The organization of military tribunals has been drafted, and the Military Affairs Commission has ordered the establishment of military tribunals in various places to exclusively handle war criminal affairs. Those that have been established include Nanjing, Wuxi, Taiwan, Xuzhou, Jinan, Quzhou, Taiyuan, Beiping, Hankou, Jinzhou, Guangzhou, and other eleven locations. Twenty-five people have been arrested in Nanjing. The more important ones include Sakai Takashi, Naida Takatoki (commander of the Japanese 70th Division), Nakajima Shinichi (head of the Japanese Kyoto-Shanghai Special Affairs Agency), and Hoboji Tokuji (Japanese Navy Lieutenant Commander). According to reports from various places, the total number of arrested people is 970.</p>
<p>Regarding the Situation in Changchun</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 18th] Today, Commander-in-Chief He answered the following questions from reporters. (1) Question: The thousands of isolated troops defending Changchun are on the verge of extinction in order to safeguard national sovereignty and protect the lives and property of the people. The people of the country are now extremely concerned about the safety of these loyal and brave soldiers. Since the government does not advocate reinforcements by paratroopers or other methods, what measures will be taken to save these people from their misfortune? Answer: It is reported that the New First Army, which is rushing to aid Changchun, has arrived near Gongzhuling. The Communist army is now guarding Gongzhuling, using various methods to block the National Army, as reported in the news. However, the government is extremely anxious about the safety of the military and civilians and receiving personnel in Changchun, and will definitely take appropriate measures to relieve this precarious situation. (2) Question: What is the current situation of the coal mines in Lincheng and Zaozhuang on the Jinpu Railway, the situation of the Communist army near Anyang on the Pinghan Railway, and the date of opening of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway? Answer: It was agreed to jointly manage the Zaozhuang coal mine, but it has not been resolved because the Communist army has not yet withdrawn. Although the railway near Lincheng on the Jinpu Railway has been repaired, it has not been connected. This phenomenon exists on both the Longhai and Pinghan Railways. This is because the Communist army still lacks sincerity in restoring transportation. (3) Question: Does the name "Self-Renewal Army" still exist? Answer: After the puppet troops surrendered, they were initially renamed "Self-Renewal Army." Later, they were disbanded by the General Headquarters of the Army. This name no longer exists. Only a very small number of "Self-Renewal Army" with better qualities are temporarily given the name of a column for the sake of temporarily maintaining local security in remote areas.</p>

<h3>The Security Council Discusses Two Major Issues: Reaching a Critical Juncture Yesterday; Poland Proposed Severing Relations with Spain at the Meeting the Day Before; It is Reported that Britain Advised Franco to Resign Immediately</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Agency] Broadcast from San Francisco, 18th: The Security Council will discuss two doubly important issues at its meeting today. In addition to continuing the discussion of the Spanish issue, the Iranian case will once again cause fierce debate. Regarding the Spanish issue, British Representative Cadogan will state his position today. As for the Iranian case, the expert committee will submit a report. Today's meeting is the most critical juncture since the Security Council began its work.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the U.S. News Agency, New York, 17th] After the Security Council reconvened this afternoon, Polish Representative Lange immediately filed a complaint against the Franco regime, accusing the regime of seriously threatening world peace and security. Lange also delivered a lengthy speech, presenting documents urging the United Nations to immediately sever relations with Spain. It stated roughly that Franco seized power with the military assistance of the Axis powers, which was not the will of the Spanish people at all. Therefore, the Franco regime is an enemy of the United Nations. Franco even assisted the Axis powers in combat with explosives and other materials. This was not an ordinary commercial exchange, but contained political functions, which was assisting the Axis powers in fighting against the United Nations. Since Franco supplied various bases for the Axis powers to use and also assisted Japan in attacking Pearl Harbor, all of this can be regarded as an unofficial ally of the Axis powers. Therefore, the Franco regime is not only an internal affair of Spain. French Representative Bonnet immediately agreed with the Polish proposal. It is said that the continued existence of the current situation in Spain will "threaten world peace." The Spanish debate lasted for more than three hours before adjourning in the evening. Bonnet stated that France is ready to take further action and impose economic sanctions on Spain. The Mexican representative also followed the French representative and expressed his support for the Polish motion. Dutch Representative Kleffens and U.S. Representative Stettinius opposed interfering in Spain's internal affairs, but both representatives criticized the Franco regime. Stettinius said that this issue must be resolved by the Spanish people themselves.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 17th] The Security Council held its 34th meeting tonight. Egyptian Representative Yaffee succeeded Guo Taiqi as chairman, delivered a speech at the opening, and expressed his warm gratitude to Guo. Yaffee declared after the meeting that the principles involved in the Security Council's discussion of the Spanish issue were even more important than the facts. This principle is whether the United Nations organization can intervene in any country because its domestic situation is sufficient to evolve and endanger international peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] Well-informed sources here believe that Britain has made an informal proposal to the Spanish government, requesting that the country's dictator, Franco, should resign immediately. The British Foreign Office no longer conceals its policy towards Spain, the main purpose of which is to overthrow Franco without causing Spain to fall into the hands of communism.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] Before the Security Council adjourned yesterday, Soviet Representative Gromyko suggested that the meeting be held as usual on Easter Friday. The Brazilian representative was the first to stand up in anger to object, and the representatives of the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands also quickly expressed their opposition. As a result, it was decided that after convening a meeting today, the meeting would be postponed until after the holidays.</p>
<h3>Iran Suddenly Implements News and Telegraph Censorship: The United States Has Sent Urgent Telegrams to Inquire</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Iran suddenly implemented strict news and telegraph censorship today. Upon receiving the report, the U.S. State Department immediately sent an urgent telegram to inquire in order to determine whether Iran's move was at the instigation of the Soviet Union and what measures the United States could use to make Iran lift the censorship. The State Department is also studying in detail the possibility of filing a formal protest. Iran's control of telegrams sent abroad this time is the same as the method used by the Soviet Union in March, called "blind censorship." Censors delete telegrams without notifying the reporter who sent the telegram. (According to Reuters, Tehran: The Iranian government has solemnly denied censoring news and telegrams.)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister of Iranian Azerbaijan Declares Willingness to Fight</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Agency] Broadcast from London, 18th: The Prime Minister of Azerbaijan delivered a speech, stating roughly: "They are unwilling to see bloodshed again, but if the Iranian central government is willing to fight, we will definitely rise up and deal with them. Our farmers have obtained fertile land with their blood and flesh and will never give it up easily. Azerbaijan is the Azerbaijan of the people of Azerbaijan and will be ruled by the people of Azerbaijan."</p>
<h3>Due to the Presidential Election Law Issue, the Three Major Parties in France Have a Rupture</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] When the National Constituent Assembly met today, the three major parties had a major rupture over the issue of the presidential election law. The Charter Subcommittee of the General Assembly had submitted a draft stipulating that the President of France should be elected by a two-thirds majority of the National Constituent Assembly, and voting must be public. If a two-thirds majority cannot be obtained in three consecutive votes, the election should be postponed, or in accordance with the same principle, it should be stipulated that it be elected by a five-thirds majority to replace the two-thirds majority. The term of office of the elected president is seven years, and he can only be re-elected once. At today's meeting, the People's Republican Movement Party proposed an amendment, advocating that the president must be elected by a joint meeting of the National Constituent Assembly and the Federal Executive Yuan, and must obtain an absolute majority. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party expressed their opposition. After being put to a vote, the amendment was rejected by 289 votes to 264 votes.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th] When the Allied Control Committee for Japan meets tomorrow, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain will formulate strict rules of procedure so that the committee can control all its witnesses and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents such as Brigadier General Whitney's "illegal delay" of three hours yesterday. There is a general opinion in Tokyo that Whitney's repeated tough statements to the Soviet Union and his determination to personally dictate his entire report may damage the United States' position and reduce opportunities for cooperation with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parties Launch a Motion of No Confidence</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th] The executive committee of the Japanese Socialist Party decided today to jointly launch a motion of no confidence with the Cooperative Party, the Liberal Party, and the Communist Party and sent personnel to formally request the participation of each of these parties.

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] Mrs. Sheillon of Saint-Manden, who is only 43 years old, gave birth to her 30th child today. Among her children, there are currently 15 survivors, the oldest being 26 years old.</p>
<h3>Japanese Scientific Researchers Invent "Atomic Energy Food": A Compound of Fish Bones, Orange Peels, and Potato Peels, After Tasting It, It "Tastes Very Delicious"</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] "Atomic Energy Food," which is sufficient to save millions of starving Japanese people, has now been invented here. At a time when there is a heated debate over the military control of atomic energy, Enomoto, a researcher at the Japanese Institute of Scientific Research, has been able to use atomic energy constructively. This sensational move seems to be a satirical contrast. Enomoto's invention originated from the bombing of Hiroshima. He believes that the sun is the largest known source of atomic energy, and sunlight constantly shines on the ground and the oceans, which occupy most of the ground. Therefore, the ocean must be the largest storage place for atomic energy. His research is to invent edible atomic energy from seawater. In addition, because fish have drunk seawater, he also plans to use fish to manufacture it. He mixes fish bones with orange peels and potato peels to make it equivalent to vitamins. After Enomoto tasted these mixtures, he exclaimed, "It's delicious!" The manufacture of atomic energy food does not require rare and expensive raw materials, because fish bones are cheap and readily available. However, Enomoto is still humbly claiming that he is not satisfied with this invention. He is still continuing to improve it and wants to increase the heat it contains from 800 calories to 1,000 calories per unit.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Explaining Various Points in Handling Enemy Property</p>
<p>Because representatives of various party, government, legal, and civilian groups in Jiaxing organized a committee to take over 166 houses built by the puppets on Beidajie Street, Director Yu of the Jiaxing Branch of the Enemy Property Handling Bureau specifically issued an explanation on the 17th on various points in handling enemy property: (1) If the property originally belonged to the people of our country, allied countries, or friendly countries, and it is confirmed by concrete evidence that it was forcibly taken over by the Japanese side, it should be returned to the original owner, but the original owner should prepare a substantial guarantee before being able to receive it back. (2) If the property originally belonged to the Chinese and was jointly operated with the Japanese puppets, its sovereignty will be taken over by the central government. If the Handling Bureau confirms by concrete evidence and the Review Committee approves that the aforementioned property was jointly operated with the Japanese puppets and was of a forced nature, it may be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and handling. (3) If the property originally belonged to Japanese residents or was purchased with funds from Japanese residents, the property will belong to the central government. (4) The debts of enemy puppet property should be paid off separately within the organization of the assets. Debts owed to the Japanese puppets should be repaid to the central government. It was also stated that with regard to the houses built by the puppets in the Beidajie area, legitimate reasons can be put forward to apply to the Handling Bureau for review and handling. If the various legal groups organize a committee to take over, it would be a division of national power.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>The County Chief Regularly Inspects: Police Chief Yang of the County Police Bureau went to various townships to inspect the progress of the academic and practical courses of his subordinates in order to understand the situation. He eliminated those with poorer performance and the elderly and weak.

<p>Jingjiang</p>
<p>Conflict Between the Nationalists and Communists in Xin'gang, Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Xin'gang, 30 li downstream from Jingjiang City in northern Jiangsu, is an important commercial hub. On the 9th of this month, it was recovered by the National Army. At about 11 PM on the 15th, the Communist army, with two regiments, besieged Xin'gang in the Jiashi Huangqiao area. There was a fierce conflict for four hours. Both sides suffered casualties. The Communist machine gunners and artillerymen even used Japanese captives. Hu Zhaowu, deputy commander of a certain regiment of the National Army, and Yin Hang, platoon leader of the Jingjiang Police Detachment, bravely took the lead and were seriously injured. Xin'gang was still occupied by the Communist army. On the morning of the 16th, Jingcheng closed its city gates for several hours, and the river was temporarily blocked. Jiangyin on the south bank was also under special martial law in the evening and increased its troop strength. The river defense is extremely consolidated.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Main Points of Interpellation at the Provisional Council Meeting</p>
<p>At the first meeting of the Zhenjiang Provisional Council on the 16th, after County Chief Zhang reported on his administration, the councilors raised questions one after another. County Chief Zhang answered them one by one. The main points of the interpellation were: (1) The county government is still employing personnel who participated in puppet organizations and should be replaced immediately. (2) The government's procedures for receiving enemy and puppet property are too vague and the handling is too slow. (3) The security team has insufficient funds and should plan ahead. It cannot condone the illegal behavior of the township and pao chiefs who harass the people. (4) The personnel collecting house donations are acting illegally and extorting money from the people. This must be prohibited. (5) During the enemy and puppet era, there was a treacherous person who colluded with the Japanese to establish the Dali Mountain Mine in Jinghu. The county government did not announce it to the people. Is it currently operating or closed? (6) Why was Da Xin Company sometimes sealed and sometimes unsealed?</p>

At about 2 PM on the afternoon of the 15th, a symposium was held in the auditorium of the Fifth District Office, gathering representatives from various agencies and township chiefs. The meeting adjourned after about three hours.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Stipulate Wages?</h3>
<p>Recently, the general public has been concerned about the lack of a path forward for Chinese industry. One reason is that the foreign exchange rate makes the price of imported foreign goods much cheaper than domestic goods, which inevitably hits Chinese factories hard. However, the main reason is the tumultuous labor unrest. Not only are business leaders discussing this issue, but many foreign manufacturers are preparing to move from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, or even Japan, and some are eager to follow suit. Even ordinary people who are usually unrelated to factories are hesitant to invest in industry upon seeing the surging labor unrest. This is truly a misfortune for Chinese industry and for Chinese society as a whole. The reason for this is that the lax labor discipline and low work efficiency make factory managers deeply feel that industrial order cannot be maintained. Therefore, they speculate that Chinese industrial products will not be able to compete with foreign goods in the market, which greatly reduces their interest in investing in industry. In addition, the chaotic and demanding issue of wage increases is also a major headache for the business community.</p>
<p>Let us put aside the general issue of labor discipline for the time being and discuss this seemingly complex but actually simple wage issue. Regarding the wage issue, there have been many proposals recently. One is to stipulate a maximum wage, one is to stipulate a minimum wage, one is to hope for unified wages, and one is to advocate for adjusting base salaries. Opinions are divided and no consensus has been reached, making the wage issue even more complicated. In fact, after peeling back the layers, none of the proposals are truly pertinent. Let's analyze them as follows:</p>
<p>The purpose of stipulating a maximum wage is to prevent workers from making unrestrained demands, thereby stabilizing costs and stabilizing industry so that it can compete with foreign goods. In short, it is intended to protect the legitimate interests of capital. The purpose of stipulating a minimum wage is to prevent capital from excessively exploiting workers, thereby protecting the deserved interests of labor and maintaining their appropriate standard of living. At first glance, these two goals seem completely opposite, but today they are occurring simultaneously, indicating that there must be other underlying reasons. The reason, in short, is that prices are too high. Because prices are too high, workers have difficulty making a living and must demand a minimum standard of living. However, the industry is also facing high prices and high costs, leading to reduced domestic sales and difficulty exporting. It cannot compete with cheap foreign goods, which endangers its foundation for survival. Therefore, it must urgently appeal to workers for understanding and demand that wage increase requests have a maximum limit. Both sides feel that they have valid reasons and justifications.</p>
<p>Because both sides' theories are based on facts and are rooted in the same reality, from a theoretical perspective, there is no shortcut to satisfying both sides' desires other than mutual concessions and assistance in order to jointly overcome the difficulties and tide over the crisis. If we rely solely on laws, whether stipulating a maximum wage or a minimum wage, we believe it will be of no help in the current situation. Therefore, to resolve the wage issue in labor-capital disputes, we must fundamentally start with stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>It must be understood that this wage, whether it is the maximum or minimum, must be based on relatively stable prices. With prices fluctuating so much now, if the price increases continue indefinitely, then what is considered the maximum or minimum today will lose its original meaning in a month or two, and will need to be readjusted to fit the maximum or minimum limit. If this limit cannot be determined one day, then the maximum and minimum wages will also be impossible to determine. In other words, fundamentally, under today's price conditions, we have no way to obtain fixed maximum or minimum wages.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people advocate for the universal application of cost-of-living indexes, taking base salaries as the basis for the maximum and minimum wages instead of fixed wage amounts. If this method can achieve the result of unified wages, it can avoid the above difficulties. However, the following problems will arise:</p>
<p>(1) Is this base salary regional or national?</p>
<p>(3) What procedures should be used to establish this base salary?</p>
<p>If it is national, then civil servants already have a base salary and there is no need to establish a new one. Then why can't the multipliers in different regions be unified? And why not use the cost-of-living index as a standard for monthly increases and decreases? If public institutions cannot implement this, but private businesses are forced to apply it universally to achieve uniformity, is it reasonable?</p>
<p>Regional base salaries are naturally simpler. But within the same region, we have already seen that many public institutions do not use uniform standards. Even those generally considered to have the best treatment, such as the China Textile Corporation, are reportedly still demanding increases. So, what kind of wage standard is considered the maximum or minimum?</p>
<p>Moreover, whether it is a base salary or a wage, if a number must be stipulated and obeyed, it must go through legislative procedures to take effect. The minimum wage laws enacted in industrially advanced countries are first passed by parliament and then promulgated and implemented by the government. This is a very obvious example. Our Legislative Yuan has not yet enacted a minimum wage law, let alone a maximum wage law. Therefore, there is currently no basis for a national wage law. If individual laws are enacted by local governments, should the local councils bear this responsibility? If the local government only uses orders to stipulate, is it legal? Based on the above theory, we have some doubts about the point of unified wages from a legislative perspective. As for the facts, if we force "equal pay for equal work within the same industry, and even equal pay for different industries," as some people hope, it is like forcing big shoes on small feet or pricing them the same, which is probably too close to idealism. Recently in this city, there have been many examples proving that forcing the same treatment within the same industry will inevitably encounter very serious difficulties, and in fact, it is ultimately unworkable. If we want to go a step further and insist on equal pay for different industries, it seems easy to imagine the result! In this precarious situation for industry and commerce, we always feel that the first thing we should focus on is stability, and the first thing we need to achieve is stability. Only from stability can we hope to survive and progress. Those who have already experienced labor unrest should urgently seek solutions; those who have not yet experienced labor unrest should not be further provoked or incited. The so-called unified wage, if it must be achieved, is nothing more than adding more fuel and oil to this raging labor unrest! This is definitely not a way to quell labor unrest.</p>
<p>As for adjusting the base salary, we believe there are two viewpoints. One is to raise the standard of living, and the other is to restore the pre-war standard. If it belongs to the former, that is another issue. We must first ask whether the standard of living of the general public can be immediately improved under the current production situation, with work efficiency so low and foreign goods being dumped more and more severely. Anyone with discernment can see the answer. If it belongs to the latter, then the word "adjust" is not very accurate at all. Because to restore the pre-war life, whether it is reasonable to make this request at this time, even if it is considered necessary, it is only necessary to multiply the pre-war wage by the cost-of-living index, without having to spend much effort on another adjustment. Once another adjustment is made, it has the effect of deliberately raising or lowering it, which has lost the original meaning of restoring the pre-war standard. Therefore, in this sense, we believe that it is only necessary to determine the base salary, without having to adjust the base salary. The base salary is a fact, a basis, a foundation, not an ideal, let alone a fabrication. Just take out the books and receipts and review them together, without any need for disputes. If there are disputes, other books and receipts must still be used to corroborate them, and subjective opinions are still not applicable. Recently popular methods of adjusting the base salary, estimating the base salary, or adding 2.5 times the pre-war base salary and then increasing or decreasing it according to the cost-of-living index are all superfluous and only sow new seeds of trouble and disputes in order to perfunctorily compromise and seek temporary peace!</p>
<p>In short, whether it is a base salary or a cost-of-living index, these are tools for solving the wage issue, not fundamental solutions. The fundamental solution still lies in the emotions and understanding of both labor and capital. Therefore, Director Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau once advocated promoting factory conferences in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law, which we believe is a way to solve the labor unrest. However, an indispensable condition must also be attached, which is that both labor and capital must sincerely participate in the conference for the development of the factory, and must not have different dreams while sharing the same bed in the conference, and especially must not deprive the factory of its management powers because of this conference. This is no longer within the scope of the wage issue and will not be discussed in detail today.</p>

<h3>After the Promulgation of the Habeas Corpus Law, the Court Implements the First Case: Wang Jilu and Wang Jishu Detained for More Than Five Months; the District Court Specifically Seeks Habeas Corpus from the Arresting Agency</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to ensure the personal freedom of the people and strictly prohibit the illegal arrest of criminals, the National Government promulgated the Habeas Corpus Law. The Ministry of Justice instructed courts in various regions to accept the people's requests for habeas corpus, which came into effect on March 15th of this year. The law stipulates that the arrest of criminals must be carried out by an agency with judicial power, and a warrant must be presented. Non-judicial agencies must transfer arrested criminals to judicial agencies for trial within 24 hours. Otherwise, the families of the arrested criminals may petition the court for habeas corpus. The court may issue a habeas corpus writ to the arresting agency, ordering it to promptly deliver the criminals without refusal. The Municipal District Court recently issued Habeas Corpus Writ No. 1, ordering a certain military agency to release Wang Jilu and Wang Jishu, two brothers. The two were accused of hiding enemy property and had been detained by the military agency for more than five months. This is the first case implemented by the Shanghai District Court after the promulgation of the Habeas Corpus Law.</p>

At 11:30 AM, while sailing outside Qi Ya Kou, the wind was strong and the waves were fierce. The captain turned the ship around and planned to sail back to Wusong. At about 1:00 PM, when it sailed to Shidongkou, seven nautical miles away from Wusong, the waves were very strong and water entered through the door, with four feet of water inside the cabin. The boiler was hit by cold water, and there was a risk of explosion. The shipowner ordered the furnace to be extinguished, and the ship was sailed to the shore and anchored. He also hung up a rescue flag and sounded the whistle for help. Some of the passengers assisted the crew in their work. After 8:00 PM, the wind and waves subsided slightly, and the ship gradually escaped the danger. At 4:20 AM yesterday morning, it entered the port, and at about 6:00 AM, it arrived outside the Fourth Road and could not be moored. The loss of some of the passengers and cargo is now being processed in water.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Fang Zhizhou (US military position), Chief of Staff of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army and President of the New China News, arrived in Shanghai from Manila and has been seen in Chinese and foreign newspapers. According to Fang, his main task in returning to the country this time is to return to Chongqing Headquarters of the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society at the invitation of a telegram to report on his work and discuss the future direction of the Overseas Chinese issue. Because he is currently the executive director and secretary of the Philippine branch of the society, he has made considerable contributions to Overseas Chinese affairs.

Yu Shaoyuan confessed that before the war, he was the chief secretary of the Jiangsu Finance Department. After the war broke out, he came to Shanghai to take refuge. Later, he was discovered by "76" and detained. He was forced to take a pseudo-official position. Yu Zifan was also detained, and it was threatened that the entire family would be arrested if he did not obey. Unable to do so, he became the Director of the National Treasury of the Pseudo-Ministry of Finance, a simplified position, and later became the Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank, and also served as a supervisor of the bank. Before the victory, he surrendered to the Songjiang Office of the Central Bureau of Statistics, and agreed to plan for a counter-offensive when the Allied forces landed in Shanghai. He also submitted certificates and employee cards. The other defendant, Yu Zifan, confessed to serving as the Director of the Deposit Section of the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank and the Director of the Wuhu Office of the bank. The court ordered the conclusion of the debate and set the sentence for 2:30 PM on the 25th. There were three other investigation cases, including:</p>

<p>The Yancheng-Fugitive Youth Corps of this city recently sent a letter to the communist Mao Zedong, complaining about the recent situation in northern Jiangsu, and listed (1) the tendency to massacre Central elements and their families, (2) inciting comprehensive class struggle, (3) the undemocratic tyranny of March, (4) organizing large-scale civil war, and other harsh policies.

<h3>The Crisis of the Domestic Leather Industry Hopes That the Government Will Take Effective Measures</h3>
<p>According to a magnate of the domestic leather (used for shoe soles, etc.) manufacturing industry, before the war, China's leather market was controlled by pseudo-domestic goods manufacturers. Imported goods were difficult to compete with because of their high value. However, at present, the US government stipulates that leather and leather-making raw materials are not allowed to be exported, but the orders for finished leather and leather shoes from various foreign firms in this city are quite large. What's more, some American leather is privately transported to Shanghai by smuggling methods. As a result, domestic leather sales are greatly stagnant. On the other hand, due to the lack of major raw materials, the production and sales of the industry are both seriously threatened. Therefore, it is hoped that the temporary committee for the import design of the Ministry of Finance will suggest that the government stop supplying this foreign exchange, prohibit imports, or increase tariffs. At the same time, it is also hoped that the government will negotiate with the United Kingdom and the United States to allow the continued shipment of chemical raw materials for leather making to China, and effectively stop the smuggling of finished leather into China, so as to change the 20 to 30 years of hard work in China's leather manufacturing industry from being destroyed.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Bureau Hosts the Press to Inspect the Dredging Project; The Dredging of Zhaojia River Will Be Completed Before the End of July</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Deputy Director Wang Shengshan of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, accompanied by representatives of the United Nations and the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, as well as more than 30 reporters from various newspapers, went to various places to inspect the dredging work. First, they went to the Heping Road in front of the No. 2 Public Funeral Home on Changping Road in the Fourth Engineering District to inspect the work. They are currently processing the segmented mud dredging. The No. 14 Heping Road on Dunxin Road is also being dredged in the same way. The Fahua River is the general confluence of drainage from No. 3 to No. 14 Heping Road in western Shanghai. The path on one side of the river is narrow, while the other side is covered with houses and small shops, which enter the river. The widest part of the river is 14 meters, and the narrowest part is less than 1 meter. The flood control road is 12 feet high, and the silt has reached 11 feet, which has a great impact on drainage. Yesterday, representatives of the residents along the river also told reporters and others about the difficulties of demolishing houses, and requested the bureau to change the plan. Then they went to Xujiahui to inspect the Zhaojia River, which is more than 2,900 meters long. More than 400 people are working, using pumps to pump water and dredge mud. The project is huge. The completed sections can already be used for boats, and the water color is also clear. There are a total of 15 Heping Rivers in the Fourth District, with a length of 14 kilometers. 8 kilometers have been dredged. The dredging of Heping Rivers in the Third and Fourth Districts will be completed before the end of July.</p>

<h3>Xi Yushu Will Give a Campaign Speech</h3>

<h3>The "Air Hostesses" Active on China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Planes</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Mai Tian</p>
<p>Inside the airplane, having a young, beautiful, and capable woman to attend to passengers, explaining the scenery along the way, etc., is still a very novel thing in China. We can't find a suitable name to call them yet, so let's temporarily call them "air hostesses."</p>
<p>The selection criteria for "air hostesses" are very strict: possessing both talent and beauty, and having conduct, demeanor, and work ethic that are sure to satisfy people, goes without saying. Just looking at their uniforms, one can call them "extremely beautiful." A brown woolen "jacket" and short skirt, paired with a brown leather belt, brown mid-heeled leather shoes, and a "jacket" without a collar. The right lapel is fastened to the left lapel with two gold buttons, and a silver airplane is embroidered below the right shoulder, with the CNAC logo embroidered beside the left sleeve. Such attire looks much more beautiful than the uniforms of American female soldiers.</p>
<p>The director responsible for the training class is Ji Lai. He adopts American methods to train the Chinese ladies. Applicants must undergo physical examinations, intelligence tests, and be able to speak Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. The coursework after admission is also quite laborious. The training period is set at two months, during which they must study aviation history, the history, organization, and routes of CNAC, Chinese geography, customs and immigration regulations, learn first aid, service regulations, and become familiar with the aircraft's equipment structure and application methods. They will also be taken to the repair shop and various departments of Longhua Airport for on-site instruction.</p>
<p>A total of forty ladies are planned to be recruited this time. The first batch of trained personnel will serve on the Hong Kong-Shanghai route. Nine are trained well, and they have already flown six times. Afterwards, they will have to fly eighty to one hundred hours per month. The first qualified "air hostess" is Miss He Beidai, who has already started demonstrating her work on the plane to Chongqing last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Another very important condition for "air hostesses" is that they must be unmarried ladies under the age of twenty-six. After the age of twenty-six, they can no longer fly and must be transferred to a ground position.</p>
<p>"Air hostesses" will not only become active in the air, bringing passengers a lot of convenience, but also develop a new career for China. (The picture shows Miss He at work)</p>
<h3>Instigating Labor Unrest and Disturbing Elements, Authorities Determined to Punish Severely</h3>
<p>According to a senior officer of a certain military organization in this city responsible for maintaining public order, the frequent labor unrest in this city is indeed caused by high prices and the difficult lives of workers. However, it is also not uncommon for disturbing elements to attempt to manipulate the situation and disrupt social order. It is reported that Song Runde, Lu Zhifang, Zhu Yaozhong, and others, workers of the Hu'an Woolen Mill in Shanghai, repeatedly caused trouble during the labor unrest at the factory last month. Now that they see their plans have not been realized, they have absconded and are hiding. It is hoped that they can quickly repent, and they will be exempted from legal action. In the future, those who instigate labor unrest and disrupt social order will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>American Military Tribunal Arraigns Japanese War Criminals for Abusing Filipinos</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Japanese war criminals Warrant Officer Hoshikawa Morinjiro, interpreter Nagai Masatsugu, and Sergeant Mukaiyama Kunitada were accused of mistreating five Filipinos. At nine o'clock yesterday morning, they were arraigned for the first time by the American Military War Crimes Tribunal at Ward Road Prison. The tribunal was composed of Colonel Geber, Lieutenant Colonel Bailey, Major Hatton, and Captain Kelly. Prosecutor Lieutenant Osborn read out the indictment, stating that the three defendants, in April 1944, at the former Japanese Kempeitai station at 94 Jessfield Road, subjected five Filipinos who were loyal to the United States—Evan G. Lisite, Metos, Espino, Kros, and Vera—to skin burns with cigarettes, beatings with fists and kicks, and electric shock torture for fifteen days. Later, they sentenced the five men to eleven years in prison and imprisoned them in Ward Road Prison. He requested the tribunal to find them guilty. In addition to Lieutenant Duna, the defendant's defense counsel also included Japanese military Captain Nishi, who requested adequate time to prepare the defense materials. The court announced that the hearing would be rescheduled for 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Busted at Cishu Building</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] At approximately 9:30 p.m. the night before last, the Huangpu Branch received a report that merchants in the hardware, electrical appliances, machinery, and other industries were gambling in the Nanyang Alumni Association room, number 540, on the fifth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road. More than ten police officers were dispatched and arrested Zhou Zigang, Zhuang Qianguang, Li Chengzong, Chen Xiangting, Zhang Xiyun, Jiang Tangxin, Xu Shijiang, Chen Jianshu, and others, and seized gambling paraphernalia and chips. They were all taken to the bureau for questioning and released on bail pending further summons.</p>
<h3>Trans-Pacific Southern Route Air Service to Resume Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] According to a wireless telegraph from the New York edition received by the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" yesterday, Pan American Airlines will resume its pre-war trans-Pacific southern route air service on May 15th. However, Mr. Yingte, the company's representative in China, has not yet received formal notification. Currently, all relevant parties in this city hope that the company will utilize the northern route previously flown by the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA)-chartered Constellation aircraft when resuming the route. It is estimated that the northern route is 2,900 miles shorter than the southern route. Recently, the volume of airmail to the United States has piled up in the city, and delivery is slow. The resumption of the trans-Pacific air service should be able to alleviate this difficulty.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Rise Despite Government Rice Loan Program; Procurement Procedures Worth Considering</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the rice loan program was approved by the authorities, the source of rice has gradually become smoother, and market prices should gradually stabilize. Unexpectedly, it soared by three to four thousand yuan the day before yesterday, and rose by another one to two thousand yuan yesterday morning, which was quite unexpected by the general public. According to industry insiders, this is because each producing area believes it can hoard the goods for high prices, resulting in price hikes, which in turn affects the market price in this port. However, some people also say that some merchants are scrambling to purchase them near the river in this port. Seventeen merchants have been approved to apply for rice loans. It is reported that the collateral is limited to title deeds and bank guarantees, which are not easy for most merchants to borrow. They are currently petitioning for a change. In addition, the Soybean and Rice Industry Association is still requesting the authorities to provide unrestricted loans in order to achieve universal benefits and expand sources.</p>
<p>The rice market opened again with a rise of one to two thousand yuan yesterday morning. At noon, due to indigestion, it fell by more than a thousand yuan. Compared with yesterday, it was slightly higher by three to five hundred yuan. Flour from the Shanghai-Songjiang group was still acceptable, and the price continued to rise by one to two hundred yuan. Soybeans also increased by three to five hundred yuan. Soybean cakes were strong in the morning and slack in the afternoon, and the price was flat. Raw peanuts were stable, sesame was firm, bran was strong, corn was firm, and red sorghum was sluggish and remained downstream. Oil prices remained sluggish due to continuous arrivals, and fell again by a thousand yuan. Grain prices will temporarily depend on the rise and fall of producing areas.</p>
<p>According to news from the grain administration authorities, the recent fluctuations in rice prices in the city are purely speculation by speculators. Currently, there is a large stock of rice in Shanghai, and foreign rice will soon be imported in a steady stream, so there should be no shortage of food. In the future, if it is discovered that illegal grain merchants are inciting the market, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law after investigation, and the police authorities have been consulted to assist in monitoring. According to rice industry news, a large amount of rice will be transported to this area this week, approximately 20,000 shi or more. Part of this rice is purchased by rice merchants, and part is purchased by the grain administration authorities.</p>
<h3>American Dollar Buying Sentiment Still Strong, Gold Prices Calm</h3>
<p>The red market was stable yesterday. Holders still closed their positions at high prices. American dollars were firm, and there was a lot of arbitrage in the gold market. The market was also relatively tight due to the tight situation, so demand and supply were balanced, and the process was mostly sideways. The morning opening was stable, and after opening, it once strengthened, hovering around 1.56 million. The Bank of China's allocation price remained unchanged. However, the high price could not be sustained for long, and more and more stocks were successively launched, gradually declining. In the morning, it fell back to 1.53 million. In the early afternoon, it was slightly sluggish, falling back to 1.52 million. In the end, it was still flat, and the result was a slight increase of 10,000 compared with the previous close. Silver jewelry was 168,000, silver ingot was 1,600, and silver dollar was 1,050 yuan for sale. The implicit interest rate on silver was even higher. The daily interest rate among industry members was only 12 to 14%, and the long-term interest rate was 15 to 16%.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange banks still had inflows of US dollars. Industry members did not have much stock and it was not easy to collect. From the initial 2,050 yuan in the morning, it gradually rose to 2,100 yuan. Afterwards, the gold market was slightly sluggish, and the upward momentum was blocked. At noon, it was around 2,080 yuan, and the arbitrage spread was reduced to 740 yuan per ten taels. The afternoon situation remained stable, and the result was a continued increase of 30 yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong bills were slightly stable, and the result was that old bills rose by 3 yuan and new bills rose by 5 yuan. The exchange rate between designated banks and the US dollar was 2,020 yuan, and the selling price rose slightly to 2,060 yuan. There were more settlements for yarn and flower, and Hong Kong electricity Robbie was still stable.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Listless on the Black Market, Chinese Stocks Continue to Decline Slightly; Foreign Stocks Closed for Spring Holiday</h3>
<p>After the police intervened the day before yesterday, government bonds were slightly more restrained yesterday and there was not much activity. Only the Unified B bonds had some guerrilla-style black market transfers, with market prices around 5,500 yuan. Miscellaneous brands were silent. Chinese stocks continued to decline slightly, and they were always under selling pressure after the morning opening. However, the process was extremely mediocre. The lowest prices in the morning were 4,800 yuan for Yongsha, 4,000 yuan for Meiya, and 408 yuan for Jingfu. The noon closing was slightly stable. Although the second-hottest Xinguang and Qinxing were sluggish in the middle, the situation was reversed at noon, and the results were pulled up. As a result, the three hottest Yongsha, Meiya, and Jingfu saw slight declines compared with the previous close. Xinguang and Qinxing rose and fell only slightly. Sino-French, New Asia, and Underwear were stable. The rest all fell. The veteran stocks were flat. In the afternoon, Yongsha rose slightly to 4,900 yuan, Meiya to 4,120 yuan, and Jingfu to above 420 yuan. Transactions were limited. Due to the Western Qingming Festival, foreign stocks still followed the old practice and seemed to be closed for three days for spring. There were no formal public transactions on the market yesterday. Due to some transfers by holders, the prices quoted in the off-site black market fell slightly compared with the previous close.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Firm, Spot Cotton Transactions Quite Active</h3>
<p>The yarn market was very stable yesterday. High-grade 20-count yarns, such as Shuangma brand, made little progress due to the sluggish appetite of the Cantonese group. Small 20-count yarns were quite popular among customers from Jing and Wu, so the price increased by 10,000. Overall, the spot supply of 20-count yarns from various factories is still insufficient, so the market is quite firm and does not seem to be easy to fall sharply for a while. The Textile Construction Company opened sales of 30 kinds of cotton cloth yesterday, including 17 kinds of American and Mexican cloth. As usual, cotton yarn will be sold today.</p>
<p>New York American cotton futures fell by 7 to 16 points yesterday, with the near-term at US$27.44 and the long-term at US$27.55. The spot price of middling was US$28.03. The spot market conditions in this port were still flat, but transactions turned better again. The reason is that the yarn mills taken over by the Textile Construction Company from Japanese merchants urgently need raw materials, so they suddenly made a huge purchase of 2,600 to 2,700 bales of middling, Pengjiapo, and Brazilian cotton. In addition, private yarn mills and industry members are all watching and have not taken action.</p>
<h3>China Textile American Cotton Shipped to Tianjin</h3>

Another 46,700 yuan was sold in the North City. The numbered plate opened at 43,000 yuan for green sugar, and 40,000 yuan for oil package without tax bill.</p>
<h3>Aged Tea Still Shows No Improvement</h3>
<p>Transactions of aged red silk tea still have no improvement, especially Qimen tea. High-grade goods lack a suitable owner, and medium-grade goods have dropped to 80,000 yuan, but the sluggishness is still strong. As for the new Longjing tea, customers are reluctant to sell easily, and the market price has not fallen.</p>
<h3>American Caustic Soda Orders Can Only Be Shipped in August</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of caustic soda fell slightly due to some retail sales. The monthly brand was 360,000 per barrel, and the American goods were 290,000 yuan per barrel. Other Vaseline was 700 yuan per pound, white wax was 215,000 yuan, pure alkali was 55,000 yuan per bag, baking soda was 45,000 yuan per bag, white oil was 500 yuan per pound, and triangular glycerin was 295,000 yuan. Three thousand barrels of American caustic soda have been transferred from Manila, but that place has restricted exports, and all exports must be licensed.

<h3>New York Cotton Market Open as Usual During Spring Break</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] The markets in London, the United States, and Canada will be closed on April 19th. The London market will continue to be closed on Saturday, April 20th. All American markets will be open except for the New York and New Orleans cotton markets. On Monday, April 22nd, London and Canada will be closed, but the American market will be open as usual.</p>
<h3>Mosquito Nets Cannot Be Exported Due to High Prices</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Regarding the difficulties of the import and export industries, according to Wang Shiyan, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Import and Export Trade Association, export taxes are currently paid in accordance with the export tariff published in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934]. The tax standards are two levels of 5% and 7.5%, and another city surcharge is paid. All of them are calculated according to the average wholesale market price at the time of export, in accordance with the prescribed tax system. Export goods that have hope in overseas markets, such as pig bristles, tung oil, raw and cooked hides, eggs, soybeans, and kernels, must be taxed. These items were exempted from tax during the war due to exchange settlement reasons. Now that the government has abolished the official exchange rate, the tax exemption provisions for the original exchange settlement items have been declared invalid. In the two months after the opening of the foreign exchange market, due to the skyrocketing prices, the cost of production, purchase, and transportation of export goods, converted at the current exchange rate, has mostly been above the market price in foreign countries. Tung oil is about 10% higher, casings are about 30% higher, cow and sheep hides are one times higher, silkworm silk is 10% higher, and the price of tea and eggs is also only higher and not lower. Exporters are unable to operate exports. If the government does not take measures to encourage them, the export business will face the danger of complete stagnation.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education to Cease Receiving and Sending Official Documents in Chongqing from May 1st; Some Staff to Remain in the Provisional Capital to Assist with Educational Recovery</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua recently came to Nanjing and has been busy with official duties for days. When this reporter visited him, he informed us of the recovery situation of the Ministry of Education, the main points of which are as follows: At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War's victory, the Ministry of Education did not move entirely to Nanjing. In order to facilitate the contact of educational affairs in the adjacent provinces and cities, official documents from Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi and the two cities of Jing (Nanjing) and Shanghai were directly handled by the Ministry in Nanjing. The rest were handled in Chongqing. Now that the Ministry of Education has made preparations to move entirely to Nanjing, it has been decided that from May 1st, all official documents from all provinces and cities across the country should be submitted to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing for handling, and Chongqing will not issue separate documents externally. However, due to transportation issues, whether the documents and archives can be transported to Nanjing as scheduled is still a problem. Some staff will remain in the provisional capital to assist the schools and educational institutions in relocating and recovering. Although the transportation industry has given special assistance to the education sector by providing one-third of the seats on ships and planes, there are many people returning to the capital, and the number of ship and plane seats is limited, so it is feared that the schools and educational institutions will have to wait until autumn and winter to be completely moved away.

<h3>Minister of Education, Minister Zhu, Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>[Local News] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua will arrive in Shanghai this morning from Nanjing to inspect the educational situation in this city.</p>
<h3>Educational Representative to the National Assembly, Jiang Jianbai, Returns Home</h3>
<p>Having been ordered to be stationed in Burma and India during the war, he recently investigated education in the United States.</p>
<p>[United China News Agency Dispatch] Mr. Jiang Jianbai, an educational representative to the National Assembly, returned from the United States to attend the Assembly after receiving a telegram. He arrived in Shanghai by ship yesterday. Before the War of Resistance, Mr. Jiang assisted Mr. Pan Gongzhan in Shanghai, presiding over educational administration, and achieved notable political accomplishments. After the outbreak of the war, he was appointed by the Ministry of Education as a special commissioner stationed in Shanghai. Under the strong pressure of the enemy and puppets, he maintained the lifeline of education, a feat of great merit. In the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], the enemy and puppets tightened their control, forcing him to go to Chongqing. He was ordered to go to the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou to inspect education and culture, and to dedicate himself to the supervision and promotion of wartime education and culture in those provinces. He convened educational conferences in various provinces, laying the foundation for wartime education.</p>
<p>Stationed in Burma</p>
<p>In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], he was again ordered by the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to serve as an educational commissioner stationed in Burma. In addition to supervising overseas Chinese education, he also engaged in the organization and liaison work of overseas Chinese. In the winter of that year, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, initiating the Pacific War, and then invaded Burma. Mr. Jiang, amidst the raging flames of war, launched and organized the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief Association with Mr. Zeng Yangfu, Mr. Wang Junsheng, and others. On the one hand, they provided relief to overseas Chinese during wartime, and on the other hand, they organized and trained overseas Chinese to assist in the war effort. Later, he guided and organized the Burma Anti-Japanese Association, in which overseas Chinese and the highest administrative authorities in Burma participated, greatly contributing to the advancement of the war effort. Later, the Japanese army raided Mandalay, and Mr. Jiang was surrounded. He personally braved the arrows and led Burmese dignitaries to return to Chongqing after many twists and turns, barely escaping with his life. He received commendation and consolation from the central government.</p>
<p>Stationed in India</p>
<p>After returning to China from Burma, in the summer of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was again ordered to be stationed in India as a special commissioner, and also as a representative of the Ministry of Education in India, guiding Indian education and culture, and handling matters related to Sino-Indian cultural communication. He devoted much effort to the rectification of local overseas Chinese education and the improvement of school facilities. He also personally founded the Overseas Chinese Indian Middle School, the first overseas Chinese middle school in India, thereby deeply winning the love of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Stationed in the United States</p>
<p>After two years stationed in India, in the summer of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he was transferred to the United States to inspect overseas Chinese education in the United States and to investigate American education. During his two years in the United States, he traveled to all the major cities and rural areas of the United States, conducting precise and in-depth investigations into the past facilities and future trends of American education. He devoted much effort to Sino-American cultural cooperation. He obtained the assistance of the Chicago Board of Education, which allocated more than 30 acres of land worth 800,000 US dollars in an area where overseas Chinese were concentrated, to build sports fields and various houses as a center for overseas Chinese education, culture, and health activities, which was a pioneering initiative by Americans to assist overseas Chinese. In addition, he made many contributions to publicizing the achievements of the motherland's war of resistance and promoting American aid to China. He gave more than a hundred public speeches, and devoted himself to the supervision of overseas Chinese education and the strengthening of overseas Chinese feelings.</p>
<p>Returning Home</p>
<p>During his spare time, Mr. Jiang also studied education administration and vocational education at the Teachers College of Columbia University, so that his 30 years of practical experience in education could be integrated with the latest educational theories, and his research results were very rich. As the opening of the National Assembly was approaching, he received a telegram to return home quickly and will attend the Assembly as an educational representative. The reporter visited Mr. Jiang at his residence yesterday. He said that he will stay in Shanghai for a week and then go to Nanjing to report to the National Assembly and report to the Ministry of Education.</p>

In the first match, Dahua played against Haiying. Dahua's Yang Yuanlong and Zhang Shaoqing made contributions, leading by four points to zero. Haiying was unwilling to be outdone, creating a seesaw situation, and the battle was tense. At the end of the first half, Dahua led by only 26 to 23. After the break, Haiying was able to support itself at first, but after 25 to 31, Dahua broke free, and Yang Yuanlong scored repeatedly. In the end, Dahua eliminated Haiying with 59 to 42, achieving a successful start. In the second match, Donghua was supposed to play against Encas, but Donghua announced its withdrawal due to participating in the Mayor's Cup football match tomorrow.

<h3>A Visit to Chengzhong</h3>
<p>---</p>
<p>Tangshan Road in Shanghai, which has been silent for eight years, now has the sound of bells ringing on time again, because Chengzhong Middle School, founded by Mr. Ye Chengzhong, has reopened.</p>
<p>Chengzhong had already been famous in society in the past, with a glorious history, but after the baptism of the "August 13th" artillery fire, a large number of books, instruments, and other educational equipment were completely destroyed by the enemy. Principal Wu Cuilun borrowed the school building of Xinhuan Middle School on Chongqing Road to hold classes temporarily. After five months, it moved to the Tongyi Building on Beijing Road; the scale was roughly formed, and the number of students increased sharply. Principal Wu also died of overwork in the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. In the winter of that year, the enemy was rampant, the isolated island fell, and Wang Zhengong Guangsheng was appointed by the board of directors to succeed Chengzhong, firmly holding his position and standing out from the crowd. The faculty and staff worked hard, persevered, and always showed the spirit of Chengzhong.</p>
<p>The rivers and mountains were restored, and the sun and moon were bright again. In the old school on Tangshan Road, only ruined walls and broken walls, thorns and weeds were seen everywhere. After planning and fundraising by Principal Wang and the directors, they worked hard to carry out the project, and finally repaired 38 houses within a month, so that the middle school department could resume classes first. The reporter went to visit the other day and happened to be there after class in the afternoon. Upon entering the school gate, I saw many young people, carrying hoes and baskets, leveling the playground with sweat on their faces, very diligent. Shimei Hall in the northeast corner of the yard was scarred and badly dilapidated. Behind it, Huaide Hall had only an incomplete facade left. On the front of the school gate, the bronze statue of Mr. Ye Chengzhong still stood majestically. Behind the statue, the clock donated by this newspaper, engraved with "Time is Gold," was only a broken cement pillar. Mengmo Hall was being repaired, and the library was already open. Many students were studying on their own, and the atmosphere of reading was very strong. Even the students scattered around were lively and polite, without the frivolous habits of Shanghai youth in general. Chengtang on the east side was originally a gymnasium, but two beams had been broken. The toilet at the very back was very neat and clean, but in front of the kitchen on the east side was still a desolate scene!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the 45th anniversary of the founding of Chengzhong. However, the school site, which covers a vast area of 40 to 50 acres, had only a few buildings left after eight years of long-term destruction! The Wuxun School in Tangyi has been restored with the efforts and assistance of the Shandong Provincial Government. The Shanghai authorities will surely be able to appreciate the state's intention to encourage the establishment of schools and actively provide assistance. But the alumni of Chengzhong should work harder to bring glory to their alma mater and apply Chengzhong's past spirit of perseverance to the restoration and construction of the alma mater!</p>

<h3>Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese</h3>
<p>— April 12th Shipping News, Our Taipei Correspondent, Evening</p>
<p>The reporter has been in Taiwan Province for a full month, with footprints all over Taipei, Taichung, and other places. What has been contacted is not only mainland and local intellectuals, gentry, youth, and merchants, but people from all walks of life. During this time, what is hidden in everyone's heart and uttered from their mouths is the same argument. This argument is based on the reality of the backwardness or even regression during the transitional period of pretense.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there is a great gap between the people of Taiwan and the people of the mainland. Bluntly speaking, it is antipathy. What is expressed on paper is a kind of Taiwanese-style writing close to scolding and satire. What is expressed in action is primitive and crude behavior. The reason for using "Taiwanese-style" is that they all use Japanese-style writing that is similar to but not fully understandable, and the methods of the invading protector, to express their inner pleas and curses. They have stirred up waves of antipathy among the people of Taiwan, but on the other hand, we see their enthusiasm for the rapid construction of Taiwan Province. We cannot but believe that this serious reality will cause some bad consequences in the future, but we cannot but firmly believe that the surge of this undercurrent will become the main obstacle to the government's policies.</p>
<p>Antipathy, Discrimination, Resistance</p>
<p>Just like the situation in Shanghai, there is also a conflict between Taiwanese and mainlanders here. In terms of time, the Taiwanese have been under the oppression of the Japanese for 51 years. They have no human rights to protect, and are restricted everywhere. After the victory, they were suddenly liberated. In terms of space, they have not smelled the air of freedom and democracy, and they have not understood the reality of China's war of resistance, and have been blinded by the Japanese's "Greater East Asia" propaganda policy. Young people under the age of 40 have not had in-depth and extensive contact with the people of the country. Upon being suddenly liberated, on the one hand, they gained freedom, and on the other hand, they showed licentiousness; and due to a lack of understanding of the country, on the one hand, they had a lingering fondness for the Japanese, and on the other hand, they felt antipathy due to the imperfect reality. We cannot say that this phenomenon is not abnormal; on the contrary, it may be the inevitable state of affairs?</p>
<p>Because of licentiousness, mainlanders find it unpleasant; due to antipathy, discrimination and jealousy arise. The result is poor public security, slow progress in work, and rapid changes in social customs. This is a terrible phenomenon. On the whole, it is much more serious than the conflict between Shanghainese and Chongqingese.</p>
<p>Errors in Concepts</p>
<p>In terms of concepts, both Taiwanese and mainlanders have made mistakes. Soldiers, large and small civil servants, and leaking merchants and boatmen who came to Taiwan from Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Chongqing seem to have the mentality of conquerors. They think that the war of resistance liberated them, so they might as well adopt a high-pressure and biased attitude, giving mainlanders preferential treatment and spiritual comfort. Some even have the idea of ​​getting rich and digging gold mines. They say, we crossed the ocean, betting our lives on it, isn't it for fame and fortune? In the "enslaved" Taiwan, after the Japanese left, isn't it our world?</p>
<p>The Taiwanese have a psychological feeling that the mainland guests are grabbing territory and stealing jobs. They believe that the Taiwanese people's resistance against the Japanese has always been working hard, and even during the war of resistance, they did their best and shed a lot of blood and sweat. After the restoration, it should be returned to the Taiwanese people, cultivated and planted by the Taiwanese people themselves, and the mainlanders should not be allowed to "sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor." Even the war of resistance was only the assistance of the Allied American, and did not belong to the Chinese military and civilians. (According to a report by a mainland colonel.) They emphasize that "Taiwan has not been enslaved" (editorial in Taiwan Minbao). During the era when the Japanese ruled with a colonial policy, they superficially touted the Japanese "equal treatment," but from the beginning, they formulated the "Article 63 Act," giving the governor-general special powers to oppress the Taiwanese. However, the Taiwanese still did not submit to force, publishing publications to criticize and argue, and even forming groups and clashing with Japanese police officers many times, which lasted for decades. They even expressed opposition to the meaning of "exploitation," saying that the Japanese colonial lack of self-reliance in economic policies was not entirely "exploitation." (Quote from a Taiwanese gentry.)</p>
<p>Manifestations in Actions</p>
<p>In terms of actions, the fact that the mainlanders could not be as satisfactory as expected was also a major factor in fostering resentment. The control and blockade policies that could not be implemented smoothly made the Taiwanese, who had been living a relatively low life in the past, not only lack allocations, but also increased the heavy burden of high prices, especially rice. In the Taichung Plain, a rice-producing area, the high price of rice caused small families who make their living from rice farming unstable and thus lead to accidents. Even in Taipei, there were unfortunate incidents between the military and civilians due to the purchase of military grain, and fertilizers that could be allocated in the past could not be supplied due to transportation. The factories, mines, schools, and banks that were taken over were all in a state of long-term stagnation. The seizure of general Japanese properties and enemy properties often showed confusion, lack of planning, and lack of steps. The efficiency of administrative work could not be expressed remarkably and nimbly. In addition, there were layer upon layer of bribery cases, such as the shooting incident in Kaohsiung, where the military police interfered with people watching free movies, and the bribery of NT$100,000 by the Jiaoyi Branch Director Zhou Bizhang, and the issuance of Japanese return certificates at NT$50,000 per certificate by a section chief in Yilan City. These chaotic phenomena during the transitional period directly and indirectly gave the Taiwanese people mental and material feelings, making them unable to tolerate, unable to accept, and unable to continue to sustain. We have no evidence to determine whether the Japanese are plotting behind the scenes, but the authorities have discovered that they have organized illegal disruptive actions in the failure to ensure public security and the prevalence of theft.</p>
<p>In terms of living habits and thoughts and actions, the mainlanders do not seem to be able to get used to the Taiwanese. In general, they have a stronger and more exposed island mentality than the Japanese. They are narrow-minded, unwilling to socialize, unkempt in dress, and the women have rough feet and lack a sense of beauty. They do not know how to spend money and love to be beautiful like those from the mainland. There is little contact with mainlanders, and they cannot use language to express themselves. These barriers often lead to misunderstandings. The mainlanders said: They love the Japanese's perseverance and hard work, and the Japanese women's gentleness and politeness, but they do not love the Taiwanese.</p>
<p>Necessary Psychological Construction</p>
<p>Due to the antipathy between the Taiwanese and mainlanders, some of it has turned into ill-will. The Taiwanese have one thing in common towards the mainlanders: if there is dissatisfaction, they will gather evidence to attack you. This primitive way of fighting is, on the other hand, knife killings and shootings. There are still not many mainlanders who have been sent to Tainan who can bravely go to the countryside. In Taipei, where the mainlanders are concentrated, the situation is much better, but it is still scary to have Taiwanese go to the countryside to collect taxes and herd livestock. This phenomenon caused by discrimination is only temporary and transitional, but we cannot ignore its impact. What is expected of the current authorities is to strengthen psychological construction while building political and material structures. It is difficult to expect improvement if you hold an irresponsible attitude, twist the concepts, and deal with Taiwan's political affairs. It is more necessary for the Taiwanese to do self-construction and carry forward the inherent spirit and one virtue of the Chinese nation. We all need to be responsible, calm, and not be harsh on blaming others, or demanding performance.</p>
<p>Chief Chen instructed his subordinates: "People are very resilient. As long as we work hard, we will have good results. Otherwise, not only will our enemies laugh at us, but our allies will also look down on us!" I firmly believe that Chief Chen and his subordinates will definitely have good performance, and will be able to win the hearts of the six million people in Taiwan!</p>
<p>The small Japanese warships in Wu Port have been blown up by the Allied forces stationed in Japan, with the aim of completely eliminating the remaining combat power of the stubborn enemy.</p>
<p>Top Picture: Exterior view of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Chief Executive Office.</p>
<p>This is the highest administrative body of Taiwan Province, the Chief Executive Office. Chief Chen Yi, who advocates "No sentries are allowed except at the headquarters," works on the third floor. The Education Department, Secretariat, and Industrial and Mining Department are all together here. It controls the political, cultural, and economic lifelines of all counties and cities in the province. It is the base camp for building a new Taiwan.</p>
<p>Bottom Picture: Exterior view of the former Taiwan Governor-General's Office.</p>
<p>The Governor-General's Office was the central hub for the Japanese to run Taiwan for 51 years. The Governor-General had to be appointed by the "Emperor." The towering and solemn building has been hit by a bullet in the waist, and the park opposite has also become a rubble field. The Governor-General's Office is temporarily used as a concentration camp for the Japanese people, and after all the Japanese people return to their country on the 10th of this month, it will be repaired and used as the location of the Chief Executive Office. The picture shows: Workers are clearing the rubble field, and people seem to be recalling the wild faces of the past Japanese rulers, but the tall and sharp pagoda shadows are welcoming new light.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's New Five-Year Plan Focuses on Expanding Heavy Industry</h3>
<p>Voznesensky, the design minister of the Soviet Union, instructed the Soviet people on what contributions they should make to the new five-year plan. Voznesensky said: "We must not forget that monopoly capitalism can produce new aggressors. To prevent new aggression, all aggressor countries must be completely disarmed and subjected to military economic control. A body must be set up in the United Nations to monitor international peace and security, and to maintain peace and prevent aggression. The Soviet Union's combat troops must be strengthened and continuously equipped with the latest modern weapons. The Soviet Union's military and economic potential must also be strengthened." Voznesensky further listed the Soviet Union's monthly goals as follows: First, restore the areas destroyed by artillery fire, so that industry and agriculture can be restored to pre-war levels, and then greatly expand them. The new five-year plan focuses on restoring and expanding heavy industry. In order to make the annual steel production exceed 45 million tons, the Soviet Union plans to build 45 steel plants, 104 rolling mills, and large-scale new plants in Siberia and the Urals. Siberia and the eastern part will open iron mines. Most of the mining areas will be surveyed for mining. About 168.8 million tons of commercial iron sand can be obtained (100 million tons in western Siberia) and 110 million tons of manganese sand. Copper production is expected to increase by 1.6 times, aluminum production by 1 times, tin production by 1.9 times, lead production by 2.6 times, zinc production by 2.5 times, tungsten production by 4.4 times, molybdenum production by 2.1 times, and tin production by 2.7 times. Coal production is planned to increase by 51% compared with the pre-war level. The virgin coal mines in the Vilyuy and Chita areas of the Far East will be mined, and 183 million tons can be obtained. In addition, coal gas will be produced on a large scale, and oil refining will be carried out in the Far East, Sakhalin, and other places, so that the industrial development of the Far East can catch up with the south. The Soviet Union expects that by 1950, the commercial oil reserves will be enough for two or three years. At the same time, it also focuses on increasing the production of high-octane gasoline. By the end of 1950, it can build 4 oil refineries and 10 major oil refining facilities. Large hydroelectric power plants will be restored and 30 new ones will be completed. The first part of another eight plants has already started, and five major new plants have started construction. The amount of machine manufacturing will also be doubled in 1950. In that year, 500,000 motorized vehicles can be produced. The production of synthetic rubber has doubled, car tires have increased three times, and rubber soles have also increased by 1.3 times. By the time the new five-year plan is completed, synthetic rubber will account for 38% of the total. In housing construction, attention is paid to workers' housing, with 4 million square meters of construction each year. (United News Agency, Moscow, 16th)</p>

<h3>"Love" and "Beauty"</h3>
<p>— Song Shoulu</p>
<p>The two nouns, "love" and "beauty," are understood and also most pleasant to everyone. There is no one who does not know love, and no one who does not like beauty; this psychological phenomenon of love and the ability to appreciate beauty, I dare say, are commonly possessed by everyone. In terms of function, there is a certain connection between the two, which leads to misunderstandings among many people, who believe that whatever is lovable must also be beautiful, and whatever is beautiful must also be able to inspire love. But that is not the case; love and beauty seem similar, but there is a significant difference.</p>
<p>According to aesthetics and psychology, love originates from taste, while beauty is based on aesthetic sense. If we want to love someone or something, we must first have a sense of beauty about that person or thing, and then we will feel taste and be aroused to love. Beauty exists in the appearance of objects, while love originates from our inner hearts. However, beauty is sometimes not expressed outwardly but is hidden inwardly, such as knowledge, talent, character, etc. Such beauty cannot be discovered until it is expressed. Therefore, love is more subjective and belongs to the individual, while beauty is more objective and belongs to the general public. The two cannot be confused. To distinguish between love and beauty, we can define it as follows: beauty is not entirely love; love is not entirely beauty. But some of beauty can be said to be love; some of love can also be beauty. Beauty often arouses people's love, and love is often caused by beauty.</p>
<p>For example, with the so-called "beauty," the evaluation of this beauty varies entirely according to each person's aesthetic sense. A beauty is not necessarily loved by everyone, and an unattractive person may be loved by people. People also know that this person is beautiful but do not love them, and some know that this person is not beautiful but love them instead. As the saying goes, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder," which is the principle. Therefore, beauty can certainly arouse love, but it is also possible to feel that something is more beautiful because of love.</p>
<p>If we further discuss whether love or beauty is right or wrong, since people have different tastes for aesthetics, then we cannot criticize whose love is right and whose love is wrong, or what someone loves is beautiful and what someone loves is not beautiful.</p>
<p>For example, some people like to watch Peking opera, some like to watch spoken drama, and some like to watch movies. These different forms of entertainment each have their own unique appeal; we can never say which entertainment is appropriate and which is inappropriate, or which entertainment is beautiful and which is not. Also, some like to listen to Western music, and some like to listen to Chinese music. Those who like to listen to Western music cannot arbitrarily judge Chinese music as not beautiful and their love as appropriate, and those who like to listen to Chinese music cannot, because of their dislike of Western music, conclude that Western music is not beautiful.</p>
<p>To summarize the above, we can use two sentences to draw a conclusion: beauty differs according to each person's aesthetic sense, and love is aroused by taste. Xu Weinan</p>
<h3>Beautiful Paintings and Calligraphy by Wang Yachen</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>There was once a joke that nowadays, when Chinese painters go abroad, they paint Chinese paintings; when they return to their country, they paint Western paintings. Because foreigners do not understand Chinese paintings, and Chinese people do not understand Western paintings, no matter where they are, everyone says they paint well.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Wang Yachen of the Chinese Painting Exhibition does not follow the joke mentioned above. In France, he copied and studied Western masterpieces from various eras. After returning to China, he abandoned canvas and studied Chinese painting more deeply. What he exhibits in China, nine out of ten times, are domestic paintings, especially his goldfish, which are loved by the general public. There must be a reason why domestically produced paintings that everyone recognizes can be created to be loved by everyone. For example, in Mr. Wang's paintings of fish, he did indeed study the living habits of fish for a long time in the Wuxi area.</p>
<p>Chinese characters originally were pictographic, in other words, they were drawings, hence the saying that calligraphy and painting have the same origin. Even now, I believe that the reason why Chinese writing has become an art form is because writing is equivalent to drawing a picture. When we write, we are drawing portraits of the characters in the dictionary. Moreover, our painting emphasizes spiritual likeness rather than physical likeness, so cursive script is more valued than regular script. However, this drawing task of writing is more difficult to express than drawing flowers and figures. Because writing is just the coordination of lines, and it is only a movement of one color, it is really not easy to write well, making people feel skilled and not oily, feel lively and not rigid. Knowledgeable people in our country often say that once you write well, it is easier to learn to paint. This is indeed true. Because Chinese painting is based on lines, writing is the basic practice of Chinese painting, just as charcoal drawing is the basic practice of Western painting.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's calligraphy also has its own characteristics, just like his paintings. Now his calligraphy and paintings are displayed together. If we want to know how he paints, we can verify it with his calligraphy, and nothing will be able to hide.</p>
<h3>On Painting</h3>

<p>In the wilderness, a low pagoda is a branch, ancient books and thatched cottages in the flat fields, good poems are only in the vague distance, and I stroke the red orchids and stand for a while.</p>
<h3>A Pair Flying Together (28)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Master Mo has no worries now, he understands that his life is like a candle in the wind, nearing its end! Therefore, he can quietly endure the torment of illness, and he is waiting for an eternal and transcendent rest!</p>
<p>Since being beaten that night, Madam Mo had planned to retaliate the next day, using all her strength to return the favor to Master Mo, but Master Mo's illness prevented her from fulfilling her resolution. Therefore, she has been deeply aggrieved! She even hoped that Master Mo would get well soon, so that she could have a serious fight with him, in order to vent her anger. In short, she had no intention of pitying Master Mo, let alone caring for him. Because of the damage to her self-esteem, she had not gone to see Second Madam Weng for a long time. At the same time, her anger had not subsided, so she often vented it on the children!</p>
<p>Now, Madam Mo overprotects Master Mo because of Lihua, and she no longer likes her very much. Every time she thinks of this, she is annoyed! Neither of the two children she gave birth to is on her side. Therefore, she transferred her affection to Liyun. The children did not know jealousy about this, and Lihua was happy instead, because with Liyun accompanying Madam Mo, she could have more time to serve Master Mo. At the same time, Second Madam Weng had a new interest and gradually became distant from Madam Mo, which was also a source of complaint for Madam Mo.</p>
<p>Liyun was almost at the Mo's house every day. In fact, she was not there for Madam Mo, but for Lihua. Her friendship with Lihua almost surpassed the friendship between Madam Mo and Second Madam Weng. Although she was very wild, she listened to Lihua's words very much. Lihua taught her to be good; taught her to read; so she loved Lihua and respected her. Lihua occupied a very important position in her little heart, and the impression her father and mother gave her was very indifferent, neither yes nor no, but she could not live without Lihua.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one day, Liyun arrived at the Mo's house crying with a letter in her hand. Madam Mo and Lihua were both surprised, thinking that Second Madam Weng had beaten her, or that she had caused some trouble, so Madam Mo quickly asked her:</p>
<p>"What's making you so sad? Xiaoyun! Who bullied you? Tell me, and I'll help you get even."</p>

<p>Zhang Ruisheng asks: I am thirty-three years old and have suffered from lung disease for two years. I have been getting pneumothorax for half a year. My chills and fever have decreased, but my appetite has decreased recently. I have had diarrhea often for the past year, and my lower right abdomen hurts when I press it with my hand, which has been going on for two years. Are these symptoms caused by lung bacteria entering the gastrointestinal tract? If so, what medicine can cure it? Is it effective to use penicillin? Please advise. Dr. Yu Xinen answers: It has become intestinal tuberculosis. Penicillin is ineffective. You can try injecting vitamin C injections or eating more orange juice and tomatoes, as they contain more vitamin C.</p>
<p>Xi asks: I am a male patient, forty-three years old. I suffered from dysentery in the spring three years ago and suddenly felt my skin turn yellow all over, especially my face, and my eyeballs too. After taking more than ten doses of Chinese medicine, the yellowing began to subside slightly after several months. I have headaches, and I feel pain and dizziness when I sit up. To this day, I can only walk slowly with a cane. My appetite is still good, and my bowel movements are normal, but I don't know the taste of any delicacies. Please tell me: (1) What is the name of the disease? (2) What medicine is effective and how much should I take? (3) What are the daily care methods for this disease?</p>
<p>Dr. Yu Xinen answers: A detailed examination, such as blood, stool, bile, etc., is needed first to determine the location of the disease, and then the right medicine can be prescribed. Letian asks: I don't know what fistula is. It looks like a needlepoint, very thin, but my pants always have yellow pus seeping out. I don't know how many doctors I've seen and how much bitter medicine I've taken, but it's never gotten better. Please advise me.</p>
<p>Dr. Yu Xinen answers: The disease is called anal fistula and there is no specific medicine. It can be treated surgically.</p>

<h3>A Widow's Hope for Her Son's Return</h3>
<p>— Xinyu</p>
<p>My neighbor, the lonely widow, Old Mrs. Ma, originally from Baoshan, is kind and virtuous, and taught her son the way of righteousness, which is praised by everyone. Her only son, Ma Xiaojun, courtesy name Zemin, received training at the Shanghai Military Training Headquarters before August 13th. With the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he withdrew with the team. Before leaving, his mother followed the example of Yue Fei's mother, tattooed the words "Loyalty and Bravery" on his arm, and tearfully sent him off to Wenzhou. In the early years, there was news from home, and she learned that he had been reassigned to political propaganda work, moving around Anhui and Jiangxi. In the winter of the 30th year, the last letter came from Yichun, claiming that he had made contributions to the Republic of China and had not failed his mother's teachings. At that time, letters from occupied areas were subject to enemy and puppet inspection, so the words were unclear. Afterwards, there was no news at all. I have heard that it has been more than half a year since the victory and restoration. The elderly mother leans on the door, hoping for her son's return, inquiring everywhere, but there is no news. His life or death is uncertain, and how can this situation be endured? Therefore, her nerves are disordered, and she mumbles all day long, declaring in public that his death on the battlefield was long expected, but she wants a real and definite news about his life or death, otherwise she will have nothing to say to her ancestors underground, which is painful to hear. Even if Mr. Ma's life and death are known, comforting the bereaved family is our responsibility after his death. We urgently hope that kind-hearted people will know his news and send a letter to Sun Qianyuan at 40 Yuelai Lane, Caishi Road, Shanghai, or publish it in the newspaper, which is not only the gratitude of Old Mrs. Ma alone.</p>
