<p>〔本報南京七日電〕政府及中共代表之五人會談，今竟日休息。據聞：國內共軍駐區及共軍佔領區行政權問題，因中共又表示不願退出蘇北，對於退出熱河·膠東，亦持異議，故會議迄未獲有顯著成就。現政府代表方面已由邵力子將會談經過呈報蔣主席。今晚消息，五人會談仍擬繼續舉行，並有於明晨九時，仍在陳誠公館或瑯琊路邵力子公館舉行說，惟截止今夜十二時，通知尚未發出。</p>

<h3>日本腦炎症　在津發現</h3>

<p>〔聯合社天津七日電〕美海軍醫官今日宣稱，天津美軍現已發現傳染致命之日本腦炎症。得病身死者今日有四人，尙有二十八人在醫院救治。此種病症，醫學上尙少研究，惟知其性質兇險，死亡率甚高，尙無何種特效藥可供治療。得病處在腦部，係屬一種昏睡症。至少己有兩人於發熱感覺頭痛後五小時內則吿不救。美國軍醫當局最初發現此症，係在去年五六月間攻入琉球之後，其時疫勢不及此次之嚴重。美國方面已於昨夜用飛機運送一種血淸前來，以供注射。此間美軍當局並已採取各種預防辦法，美軍人員夜間概不出外，電影及其他集會一律停止，各兵均分發蚊帳，並澈底噴射DDT藥水。據軍醫所知，病因起於蚊咬，或由於人的接觸亦有司能云。</p>
<h3>社論　中國何為竟受侮辱？</h3>
<p>昨天我全國同胞在「七七」抗戰紀念的沉痛回憶中，竟感受到國際地位上一種不可名狀的侮辱！而這意外的侮辱，竟來自我們八九年來力求親睦的盟邦——蘇聯，眞使中國四萬五千萬人民覺得非常奇怪！</p>
<p>事情是這樣的：英美法蘇四國外長會議，决定於七月二十九日　開廿一國和平會議，討論對義，羅，保，匃，芬五國的和的草案。惟蘇聯外長莫洛托夫忽堅主中國小應爲召開和會之邀請國，美國務卿貝爾納斯當塲駁斥，認爲此舉等於侮辱中國，英外相貝文提出數種建議俾得成立邀請方式之協議，悉爲莫洛托夫所阻，最後乃接受蘇聯意見，僅以英美法蘇四强爲邀請國。後來又因和會程序問題討論無結果，請柬尙未發出。我國外長王世杰前天己發出重要聲明，主張巴黎和會應由「外長會議」全體會員國召集，否則中國政府將認爲違反莫斯科協定。這件事實，我們以爲貝爾納斯所說「等於侮辱中國」，一些也不過分，無論蘇聯有意與否，多少將影響中國人民歷年來對蘇親睦的情緒。這是非常可惜的。</p>
<p>討論對義，羅，保，匃，芬五國和約草案的廿一國和會，如何召集，由何國邀請，本來好像不是什麼了不起的一個問題，但是我們爲何要重視呢？這是國際壇坫間的禮貌問題，也是國際會議決議案的效力問題。如果大家講信修睦，而可故意輕視盟邦，大家鄭重會議，而可以抹煞决議，國際間以後更何能再有融洽祥和的空氣？按照一九四五年八月二日美英蘇三巨頭波茨坦會議公吿：由中英美法蘇五國組織「外長會議」，負責商討訂結對義，羅，保，匃，芬五國和約，並提議解決歐戰後成爲共同懸案之領土問題。又按同年十二月廿四日美英蘇三國外長會議的莫斯科協定，此項和約應由英美法蘇四外長之代理人起草，而討論此項和約草案之和平會議，則應由中英美法鮮五國組成之「外長會議」召集。由這兩次國際會議的公吿來說，中國應爲召開廿一國和會之邀請國，毫無疑義。爲什麼蘇聯外長偏要將請柬內容改爲「法國政府茲依照七月四日外長會議所决定，以四國外長會議名義，邀請某某國出席和平會議，至爲榮幸」，故意擯中國於和會召集國之外呢？這不僅是對世界大戰期間並肩作戰的中國，侮辱其地位，並且爲隨意毀棄原有國際協定的開端。履霜堅冰至，實在値得我們警惕！</p>
<p>中國在這次世界大戰中，雖因格於地理環境，未能直接參加歐洲戰區，與納粹德國及其附庸作戰，但是始終牽制了日寇百萬以上的大軍，使其泥足深陷於中國，不能對德義二國作有效的援助，這不能不說是中國的貢獻。尤其是蘇聯，在德蘇戰爭中，所以不致兩面受敵，日本始終與蘇聯保持微妙的友好關係，更不能不知此乃中國的對日抗戰之力。何况回頭看看，這次大戰的前前後後，中國是反侵略的急先鋒，保障世界和平的前衛，要非任何一國所能否認。與中國在遠東駢肩作戰的英美，固極易了解中國對於大戰的重荷，就是蘇聯的內心，也未嘗不知中國之在遠東抗日，等於蘇聯在歐洲之抗德，而並無愧色。但何以今天莫洛托夫竟藐視中國至此？稍有血性的中國人，如還天良未泯，應如何痛切反省！</p>
<p>試再檢討我國在戰時戰後的外交，在任何國際會議中，一貫的採取不偏不倚的超然態度，遇有爭論不下的時候，常以調人自居，排難解紛，希望國際間能「合」而不要「分」，就是在蘇聯與英美之間，也總想做他們的橋樑，使之溝通合作，不致分道揚鑣。我國之所以如此，不僅重視對蘇的友誼，實有感於締造世界和平的重要，不敢掉以輕心。而况中蘇同盟友好條約，中國更以自我犧牲的偉大精神，力謀中蘇睦誼的永固。我們眞不知道蘇聯外長究竟爲什麽要這樣侮辱中國的國際地位一至於此！</p>
<p>我們記得蘇聯共產黨裏有一位要人曾說：「蘇聯必須自强，然後可以不受人侮」。反過來想，英洛托夫這次侮辱中國，是要給我們中國人一個驚心動魄的新敎訓，就無異說中國是一個弱國而不是强國。假使中國眞同蘇聯英美一樣强，莫洛托夫決不會故意來使我們難受的。惟其如此，無怪美國因爲要希望中國成爲强大統一民主的中國，力圖軍事援華，協助我們整訓軍隊，而蘇聯和中共却愈要反對美國的援華，鼓　美軍自中國撤退了。我們堅决的要求外交部，必須據理力爭，務使英美法蘇信守波茨坦公吿及莫斯科協定，尊重中國爲和會邀請國的地位。同時我們更要喚醒同胞，認識國際形勢的眞面目，辨別盟邦友誼的眞價値，大家向着「國家至上，民族至上」的目標努力，自立自强，一洗外來的侮辱！</p>

<h3>四外長經長時間討論　和會程式未獲協議　蘇聯代表又從中作梗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山七日廣播：本週開始時，和平會議前途尚在未定之天。英外次吉勃提議邀請埃及與奧地利出席和會。埃及與處置北非義殖民地問題有密切關係，同時義大利將有權發表意見。三國外次業已同意考慮吉勃之提議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎六日電〕四國外長會議，今日繼續討論本月廿九日和會所當依據之原則及所當採取之程序，歷四小時之久，未能成立協議。主席蘇外長莫洛托夫所提出之議事日程，包括三項原則：（一）和會議事程式，（二）賠償問題，（三）德國問題，其中第一項即已費去四小時之久。按以上三項計劃中，第一第二項乃係法代表團於本年四月間起草，其第三項則係蘇代表團新近所提出。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎六日電〕四強外長於今日下午繼續開會討論廿一國和會應以何國為邀請國之問題，昨日曾就此一問題討論數小時之久，以不能協議中國是否應與英美蘇法同為和會之召集國而無結果。貝爾納斯及貝文一度在抗議之下，已接受莫洛托夫之要求，同意僅以英美蘇法為召集國，惟和會請柬必須立刻發出，並不得對中國寓有侮辱之意。不料莫洛托夫又從中作梗，堅決主張和會程序法，必須於發出請柬以前擬成。關於此點，其餘外長表示不能接受，故和會召集國之確定及程序法之起草問題等，當於今日下午繼續討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕據此間外交當局私下預測：四國外長會議對於和約草案工作雖有進步，但蘇聯仍將竭力延長時期，使其軍隊留駐東歐。否則將見蘇聯外交政策之重大改變，而列強間之緊張形勢亦可隨之大見緩和。歐洲方面所駐佔領軍之提早撤退，則為美國務卿貝爾納斯方針之一。據此間所接消息，佔領軍問題已逐漸具體化，具氏主張由列強成立協定，規定於和約簽字後三個月左右撤兵，莫洛托夫則造成於和約批准之日決定撤兵日期。惟自和約簽字以至批准，其間可以經過數月甚至數年之久，如果接受莫氏主張，則蘇聯軍隊盡可長期留駐，此與美國早日恢復和平狀態之意實相違背。歐洲方面蘇駐軍至少有一百五十三萬人，德境約有蘇軍六十萬，波蘭方面卅五萬，奧境在十五萬以上，巴爾幹方面五十三萬左右。至於蘇聯在南斯拉夫及阿爾巴尼亞之軍事行動，則尤為種種謠諑之題材，惟迄無正式報告。</p>
<h3>義大利民眾兩萬人　羅馬廣場大示威　特港亦有同樣行動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦七日廣播：昨夜羅馬親義派羣眾舉行示威，反對四國外長對特里埃斯及維尼齊亞求里亞之決議。當英軍官四十人自電影院走出時，遭羣眾以石塊投擲，英官兵當即採取應付措置，將義人約一千名於數分鍾內加以驅散。聞昨日示威時有六人被捕，十一人受傷。警察曾使用催淚彈達八次之多。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬七日電〕義大利羣眾約二萬人，昨晚在此間人民廣場舉行集團示威運動，對於四國外長會議不利於義國之決定表示抗議。此種示威運動，具有反聯合國性質。當義參戰軍人協會主席費沃拉發表演說時，羣眾報以「打倒英國」及「打倒法國」之呼聲。費氏之言曰，「法國並無個人獨裁者如我國墨索里尼之類，但吾人新近將受法國之中傷，應由法國全體人民負責。」費氏言及法國為吾之「拉丁姊妹國」時，語聲為華眾之吼聲及噓聲所阻斷，若輩高呼曰，「拉屎姊妹不是拉丁姊妹。」會後羣眾復在街頭游行，行經法軍當局徵用之房屋時，示威者向法國國旗表示輕蔑之色並向之唾吐。</p>
<p>〔聯合社特港六日電〕四強外長會議決定以特里埃斯特為國際自由港後，今夜此間已發生反聯合國示威運動，英軍使用木棍及催淚彈以驅散羣眾。義青年數百人，在聯合國軍政府多數人員居住之巨廈前抛磚擲石，忽進忽退，有如潮湧。示威者與散步之英軍衝突，雙方所投石塊以數百計，受傷之人無從分辨。</p>

<h3>英蘇兩國關係好轉　蘇報對美集中攻擊</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科六日電〕莫斯科人士感覺今日之國際外貌，已較過去多月為佳。莫斯科外交家認為巴黎外長會議之結果，已使政治空氣肯定轉好。觀察家雖認此乃暫時現象，尚有許多困難未曾解決，但任何疑慮之減輕，終不失為一局部之勝利。蘇聯人民感覺外長會議之成就，得力於蘇聯代表團之讓步及建議。近來蘇聯報紙之攻擊對象，似已自英國移至美國，原子炸彈·汎美主義·企圖在世界普設基地·以及干涉中國事件等，均為其攻擊目標。英蘇貿易談判，前途似轉光明，蘇聯之五年計劃，需要各種機械、正可以其過剩之木材，向英易取也。</p>

<h3>英國政治路綫的表裏</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者雪岩　六月十五日航訊</p>
<p>最近英國的報紙，很少刊載中國消息，據說，原因之一是中國政府還京以後，倫敦與京滬間的電訊，仍未復常態。很多重要新聞，在倫敦的中國機關，因為無法證實，往往在被問到的時候直截否認了，待若干時後獲得證實時，已失去了新聞性。</p>
<p>對華舆論一般</p>
<p>茲舉一例，如行政院的局部改組，祗有「泰晤士報」登載，但證據顯然沒有把握，若干时後，「星期觀察報」也略略提到，其他報紙隻字未及。又如國軍進入長春，也祗有「泰晤士報」有報導，其餘各報皆未刊載。不過這些消息，報導雖少，但受關切中國問題的人的注意，却無二致。「泰晤士報」於刊載國軍進入長春，向哈爾濱推進消息的次日（五月廿九日），即刊載評論，說中央政府的威望，已因此提高，妥協可望完成。又說國共的停戰協定，不把東三省包括在內真原因雖不知，但或許由於中央信任中蘇條約，根據法理上的權利，認為收復東三省不成問題；而共黨則自信其當地的實力，所以拒絕中央軍開入，且發出挑戰性的言論。但現在事實證明，訴諸武力，不必是片面的特權。現在共黨又熱心休戰問題，放棄挑戰性言論，而中央當局，亦曾聲明願意和平解決東北問題，希望馬歇爾將軍的努力斡旋，不致徒勞。</p>
<p>目前英國報紙，對於中國的言論，很不一致，或則正反映英國人民，對中國態度方針的不確定。德日投降以來的幾次國際會議中，維持均勢，強權外交的趨勢，頗有於今為烈的現象。英國在遠東有莫大權利，將來在強國互相對立的形勢下，中英關係怎樣？頗難預言。中國如果團結強大，英國對中國的關係，自會好轉，許多問題，比較容易解決。假使中國依然分裂混亂，一如戰前，為強國的魚肉，則英國在攘權奪利之中，向來列於前茅決不甘人之後，在日本投降前後，英國朝野，似預期中國將來在國家　中，可能為一新興國家，所以對華政策，仿佛願在某種限度的讓步上，樹立新關係。但不久即見中國有分裂危機，接着又是東三省問題爭鬧不休，且在沿海一帶，國土新復，秩序混亂，而接收人員，又復醜態百出。英國的輿論，遂又一變，各報雖常載中國消息，但總不脫蔑視口吻。言外之意，仿佛為現在戰爭完了，中國又走上分裂腐化的老路。今長春收復，和平統一如果成功，英國輿論，可望又有轉變。在戰後的外交運用中，英國要找一個遠東國家建立友好合作關係，恐不成問題。目前最可能的自然是中國，所謂中國是遠東的安定力，當然為大家所矚目。但中國如不自振作，而日本的秩序如迅速恢復後，則至少英國的注意力，仍可移到日本去。</p>
<p>工黨全盛時代</p>
<p>英前任首相邱吉爾，今雖為在野之身，但其受人民的尊崇，大有歷久彌盛之勢。他足跡所到，無不受民眾的熱烈歡迎，他的言論行動，報紙常刊於顯著地位。今日在愛丁堡，市民送他一個新頭銜；明日起曼徹斯特，人民又送他一個新頭銜；人間可能的榮名，人民都很慷慨的加贈於他了。但是說也奇怪，他個人儘管享這樣的盛名殊榮，但他所領導的黨，却不能在競選中獲勝，且在各地方議會改選中，有日益不振之勢。所以今日在保守黨徵求青年黨員的廣告中最響亮的標語，祗是叫他們展望將來而已。實際上，我們如注意保守黨與工黨的政策，便知保守黨的失敗，不是偶然的。工黨政策的特點，是在大企業的國營化，謀求中下層社會的最大福利，主要的礦産，重工業工廠，以及鐵道公司等事業，一一要為國家所收購，是不用提了；就連若干和公共福利有關的職業，如醫藥事業，也要由國家統辦。這於少數業主而言，果然失去了子孫萬代的衣缽；但就一般消費者和勞苦工人而言，國營化到底合理多了。保守黨於此，沒有一個明朗的政策來對抗，祗知處處與政府為難，凡是政府所欲推行的計劃，保守黨總是在國會內反對，反對黨的政策，似乎祗有一個反對政策，現在又因人數懸殊，眾寡異勢，反對不能成功，所以至多祗能採取延後戰術，使政府政策的遂行，盡量稽滯，一般人民對他，印象相當惡劣。所以雖有像邱吉爾那樣的功績盛名，都不能挽救保守黨的頹勢。英國人民，今日一方面不惜以各種殊榮，加諸邱吉爾身上，另方面不讓其一黨執政，不是自相矛盾，而是人民政治智識水準甚高的緣故，在報德與利用之間，有所區別，不混為一談。邱吉爾在以前於國有大功，所以人民加以殊榮，表示不負德。但其黨的政策，於今無用，所以不因人害政，也惟有人民的智識程度到達這水準時，政治才能清明進步。</p>
<p>工黨現在是全盛時代，毫無疑義，政府所提出的法案，每件都能在議會通過，就是偶有老議員病故等出缺，補選上的也多數是工黨中人。但這樣的好景，能否能久長？自是另一問題。工黨全盛，工黨所標榜的許多政策，也大部見諸實行，人民就此認為合乎理想，不應再求進步，自然是不可能的。即如國營政策，原是緩進的社會主義，目的是要把私人企業，收歸公有，不過對舊有業主仍給補償。但問題就出在這上面，許多年青急進的人，已對此表示不滿，主張無條件收歸國有，至少補償的價值，定的不該那麽高，徒使一般有好爸爸好媽媽的人，可以坐食。尤其像鐵道公司那樣，因為在作戰期間賠了本，政府準備收買，先得把車票價格提高，償清宿欠，才定價收購。令人感覺有錢的人，是毫無風險的，損失祗有分攤在大眾身上，他們可以穩穩的把老本爬進。今日具有這種思想的，自然還是少數，但在年青人中，已有人說，如果保守黨能和共産黨合作，下屆競選就可以勝利了。目前這話當然是玩笑性質，但將來能推倒工黨政府的，政策較工黨必更進步，更積極，大致是相當準確的。</p>
<p>糧食大臣的悲哀</p>
<p>目前舉世荒歉，糧食到處困難。英國是個地小人多的島國，三分之二的糧食，要靠海外運來，自然倍覺艱困。前任糧食大臣史密士適逢其會，來當這難關，頗有賣力不討好之慨。自去年冬日以來，人民不滿目前食譜的，怨氣都集矢在他一人身上。反對黨的報紙，更認定他為攻擊政府的好鵠的，對準了他開砲。加以在德的英軍佔領區內，糧食奇缺，分配數量，遠非美蘇兩軍駐區可比，逼不得已，他曾到美國去商量，結果似無成就，祗能再度減少英本國的麵包及脂肪等分配數量，以急救德國。但也因此更引起了英國人民的憤懣，所以他不安於位的臆測，早經傳開了。但一則內閣的三位重臣，方在印度，貝文忙於出席四外長會議，莫立遜也要有美國之行，內閣中的要角，祗有首相坐鎮，所以大臣更換的宣布，略為稽遲，至少等待貝文，莫立遜等返國。再則，英國糧食的艱難，其解決辦法，不單是個人的才緒問題，若無外來接濟，巧婦難為無米之炊，縱然史密士下了台，旁人也難乎為繼。直至最近莫立遜赴美歸來，對於糧食問題，已經有了一點辦法，德境佔領區的接濟，無需再靠英國人民的節食，所以是發表更換糧食大臣的時候了（五月廿七日）。史密士臨別之言，是在任不能改善人民菜單，引以為歉，希望繼任之人，不致像他那樣不　。新任糧食大臣為史特拉樞，原任空軍部次長，在後起人才中，向來是被屬目的一個。接任後第一次招待記者，就說努力改善菜單，不致像現在那樣單調還希望能購運水果銷售。</p>
<p>英西關係微妙</p>
<p>弗朗哥政權，今日成為咒罵對象，許多國家，都想乘此民主勢力新勝餘威，一舉把他傾覆，肅清這法西斯劣種的餘孽。但這問題真提到聯合國的安全理事會，建議採取行動時，雖無人公然反對，實行却意外困難。要瞭解這中間的關鍵，問題又在英國。去年八月，波茨坦會議方了，三強抨擊弗朗哥政權的決議才發表，英國的工黨內閣也方組織成功，外相貝文在下院說明新閣外交政策，而提到弗朗哥政權時，他說對弗朗哥政權沒有好感，希望西班牙人民，自動起來校正這錯誤。但同時也聲明英國不願參加以外力來干預西班牙內政，因為一有外力干預，恐將激起西班牙人民的民族情緒，一致擁護弗朗哥，弗朗哥政權因此而或更鞏固。現在安全理事會中通行的始終是這個理論，弗朗哥是沒有人同情的，但是任何提議，如真可以動搖弗朗哥政權的，便都有激起西班牙民族情緒的危險，也就是都有得到相反結果的危險，因此，都受反對。言外之意，仿佛安全理事會惟有協助弗朗哥，弗朗哥政權才有消減希望式的。英澳唱之，美國和之，其他很多國家隨之，弗朗哥政權遂在這種妙論下保全穩定了。這把戲誰都雪亮，問題是英國為什麽要庇護弗朗哥呢？就政治方面說，維持歐洲的均勢，自是主因。不論納粹主義將來是否還能死灰復燃，但短期內，當無再起危險。反之，東西民主方式的對立，却很尖銳，現在整個歐洲，已經太多親近蘇聯的國家了。弗朗哥不管其過去怎樣，在許多國家左傾轉變中，還不失為一個中流砥柱，為什麽要把他傾覆呢？再德義敗後，西班牙的國外貿易，都轉到英美手中，就英國論，一九三八年春季，即戰前最後一年的春季，英國全部對外貿易，計值二億零八百五十餘萬鎊，其中對西班牙的貿易佔二百四十萬餘鎊。今年同季，英國全部對外貿易為二億零三百二十餘萬鎊，總額還趕不上戰前，自然是許多工廠還未完全恢復原狀的緣故；但對西班牙的貿易却較當年增加一倍有餘，計為五百九十餘萬鎊，將來還有增加的希望。看在這筆買賣面上，英國也希望西班牙內部安定，不再有變亂。難怪法國的職工同盟在要求政府封鎖法西邊界時，同時要研究對策，怎樣維持法國對西班牙的貿易，不致因封鎖邊界而盡為英國所奪，弗朗哥當然也很叫瞭這種微妙關係，儘量利用機會，轉變英國的言論。聽說頗費一點錢在倫敦做宣傳工作，創設豪華的俱樂部之類，與英國朝野聯歡，請倫敦大學的西班牙教授柏斯德主持設計，相信將來必有一些結果。</p>

<h3>曲折緊張勝於一篇偵探小說　榮德生被綁全案大白　匪分上海嵊縣兩帮　兩魁首俱獲　贖價共達卅九萬五千美金</h3>
<p>被全國人士所矚目之麵粉棉紗大王榮德生被綁架案，自肉票出綁後，外界揣測紜紛，茲悉：該案要犯除宋邇生，鄭連棠二名，已由淞滬警備司令部緝獲外，主犯上海帮首匪駱文慶（又名駱大卿，駱爺叔）及嵊縣帮首匪袁仲杼（又名袁仲書），業經由第一綏靖區司令部派員捕攤。此外，並捕獲黄紹寅，趙紹宗，吳志剛，劉瑞標，袁爭飛，顧初十等六人，連同供謫贓物，已於昨日下午移解淞滬摇警備司令部併案訊辦。至其破案經過，至爲曲折離奇，記者頃自有關方面探悉頗詳，茲誌各情如次：</p>
<p>幫捉漢奸豈知受愚</p>
<p>榮案發生後，第一綏靖區湯司合官即飭該部第二處處長毛森，全力綏同偵查，毛處長於五月底，得駐滬工作人員之報告，說榮案主犯，焉駱文慶，袁仲書等，按袁等乃著名匪黨，組識至爲嚴密，耳目眾多。且各匪得贓後，多己遠颺，如欲一網打盡，殊感困難</p>
<p>該部乃動員幹練人員數十人，由毛處長親自率領，駐滬專辨此案。至上月廿一日，首將關係要犯黄紹寅一名，秘密拘獲。至廿三日，又在浙西拘獲參加榮案之綁匪劉瑞標，一鞫之下，始得實情。劉匪自認受愚，當時只以爲帮忙捉漢奸，迨發覺後，悔之已晚云云。同時並詳供參加綁架之巨匪駱爺叔，趙紹宗，黄阿大等形貌，當晚該部袁科長，即訪得趙匪住址，而趙匪遂於夜半成擒。二犯對質之下，案情漸白。根據三犯供詞爲綫索，該部遂作進一步之部署，冀獲得匪首，當派幹員按各匪之關係位置，分頭出發緝拿，得悉榮案主犯之一巨匪袁仲杼，早已離滬，僅留老嫗顧初十看守匪窟。</p>
<p>存僥倖心巨憝落網</p>
<p>該部人員，不得已乃進入袁匪寓所，實行守捕，並嚴密封鎖消息之洩漏，是時適滬報刊載榮案已破獲消息，內稱榮案主犯多人，業已逮捕云云。榮案主角之上海幫匪首駱文慶以所載不實，存僥倖心裏，爲一探究竟，遂於上月廿五日晨親至袁匪寓所訪問，詎料進入袁寓後，於擱樓梯畔發现盡是生人，情形有異，乃縱身跳樓，冀圖兔脫。守捕者爲該部糾察第六隊隊員陸志凌，睹狀知係要犯，爲兜捕計，亦奮勇縱身而下，樓高跌重，雙雙俱傷，互撲多時，駱匪乃告成擒，一訊之餘，始悉即爲駱爺叔。駱匪供稱：自榮德生贖票後，彼即絕跡袁寓，如非爲報載消息，斷不致前往云云。由此可見此一巨匪之落網，得與諭之協助不少，惟該巨憝狡黠異常，語多不實，欲自駱匪口中獲得另一主犯袁匪之綫索，至爲困難。適該部派往杭州之黄科長，又於二月廿四夜搜獲另一股匪首袁仲杼於廿五日解滬，至此榮案綁匪兩巨首，乃告擒獲。</p>
<p>機緣巧合一索而得</p>
<p>據黃科長之報告，袁匪自綁榮後，即全家離滬，遨游外埠，該部根據各方情報，斷定袁匪當匿跡於杭紹一帶，乃於廿四日晨派黄科長前往杭州偵捕。黄科長抵杭後，首先注意沿西子湖衅各大旅社，是夜燠熱異常，黄等人飲冰室稍坐，詎料機緣巧合，瞥見鄰座兩女郎，其一類似袁妻，即跟蹤而出，在湖濱一帶跟蹤竟夜，一女卒入新泰大旅社，而告脫梢。黄等乃進而查閱旅客登記簿，發現有名袁爭飛者，年齡雖相懸殊，頗感諧音，進而縝密偵查，赫然即袁仲杼也。黄等發現要犯後，當夜部署，並由杭警局偵緝隊林隊長之協助，於廿五日最四時，借查旅館爲名，將巨匪袁仲杼等三名一網打盡，當日解滬，案情至此乃告大白。出示僞證扶榮上車</p>
<p>至綁架榮德生經過，據匪徒供述，榮案上海帮匪首駱文慶，與嵊縣帮匪首袁仲杼合作，駱匪先得夥犯鄒連棠報告，謂有榮德生者，爲滬上首富，綁架甚易，乃籌之於袁仲杼，兩匪會商之下，由內綫窺探榮宅門徑及榮之面貌。四月二十一日，駱與張少卿黃阿火等犯，乘袁向吳志剛借來之汽車，前往榮宅附近綁架，守候達半小時，未果。又於同月廿四日上午九時，再加入綁匪劉瑞標，乘原車並製造類似之紅色逮捕證書，再度前往守候，約十分鐘後，即見榮車開出，張少卿即喝令榮車停駛，以備檢查，由黄阿火略示紅色證件，隨即挟榮上車，向西疾駛，經中山公園（兆體公園）中山路至曹家渡北之水電廠附近下車，扶榮至小浜邊上，早已備妥之民船，因榮船內。三天後移入中山公園鐵路旁之瓦房內，外面由鄭連棠接洽贖票事宜，計共得贖價款美金三十九萬五千元，按十六股半分配，上海帮得八股，嵊縣帮得八股半，嗣將榮釋放。又據汽車主吳志剛供稱：彼曾得贓美金三萬元云云。</p>
<p>第一綏靖區令令以案情既白，乃將該案人犯駱文慶，袁仲杼，黄紹寅，趙紹宗，吳志剛，劉瑞標，袁爭飛，顧初十等八名，及供詞八份，贓款美金五萬八千九百十元，黄金一百十九兩零九分，法幣一千零六十一萬三千八百元及金錶兩只，金錶鏈兩條，手槍五枝，連同贓物清單，於昨日下午一併移案淞滬警備司令部點收，併案訊辦。</p>

<h3>籌謀安渡青黃不接難關　京滬兩地計劃　糧食公賣制度　徐部長昨發表重要談話　田赋微實可使政府控制糧價</h3>
<p>糧食部長徐堪氏，昨晨九時在私邸接見記者，闡明本市糧食供應，田賦徵實，及糧食公賣諸問題。首稱：本人於上週蒞滬時，係與朱院長及吳市長商量民食問題，已獲具體方案，對本月份糧食供應，可以高枕無憂。此次更番來滬，乃謀如何安渡青黄不接難關，並籌畫實行糧食公賣制度。對於前者以確守供求相等，充實存底，疏暢來源爲原則，過去本人對此曾作下斷努力，關於各處洋米運華確具把握者，綜計有十五萬噸左右。此次再疏運用赣米來滬，以補不足。川運方面，</p>
<p>今晨已與盧作孚氏商妥辦法，將該公司大部份噸位撥作糧運，宋院長亦允商撥登陸艇五艘，與該公司聯合運輸，招商局再有登陸艇十五艘加入，如此本月中旬後，能有川糧卅萬餘担可來滬。赣米方面每月亦估計廿餘萬担，自南昌鄱陽湖九江到滬。內中除去極小部份充作軍糧外，其餘概作民食。徐氏並補充稱：法國經濟代表莫克斯，近由港蒞滬，並定今晨十一時晋謁宋院長，將商討以西貢米售與敌國。徐氏並稱：上海爲純粹消耗區，如有正當米商自由運入供應，以補不足，自應扶助鼓勵之。反之，對不法商人亦應嚴懲取締。談至此，徐氏對於吳市長最近所施糧食管制方法，認爲係綜合政治經濟而成，至爲妥善，將來成就，自必蔚然可觀。實行公賣，足食問題，可以解決，此爲徐氏答復糧食公賣之起首語。繼述遵照蔣主席手諭及面示，决在秋收後實行，先從南京、上海着手，然後推行至全國各重要都市。惟事前必須準備，如清查戶口，供應平衡，如何配售，及經辦人資格經騐等技術問题，以配合國策及習慣，方不致做事。自上月份起，京滬兩地，警察已奉主席諭，實行每人撥貼食米五斗。</p>
<p>徽糧並非剝削農民</p>
<p>關於田賦徵實問題，徐氏答稱：此項制度之徵糧，乃直接向地主徵取，並不剝削農民，且杜絕其他任何攤派，如將來幣制穩定則恢復徵收貨幣辦法。此外每縣設立徵縱監察委員會，並邀當地知名之士，參加督察。</p>
<p>對糧貸案保持緘默</p>
<p>迨記者詢及糧貸案意見時，徐氏始終保持緘默。略謂：在舉辦糧貨之先，其原則經過縝密考慮，規定辦法甚嚴，糧貸商名單則係審委會開陳，如糧貸款不能移作別用，來貨成本經過考核諸點，均臻完美。惟執行者是否有舞弊一點，正由軍法司法審訊中，將來目有正確之發表。關於答復程中行監察使糾察書全文，徐氏面允明晨將予發表。</p>

<h3>凄風苦雨送歸人　東北難胞回鄉去</h3>
<p>淒淒風雨中，記者往訪　　滬上的東北難胞，他們要回到遙遠的故鄉去了。</p>
<p>奉天號海輪已停泊在黄浦江中，靜靜等待着他們今日午後二時半上船，明天清晨便可啟碇，乘風破浪，向葫薩島馳去。預期六天以後，便能將他們平安送返離別了十載有餘的故土，再也不必顛沛流離，再也不用餐風宿露了——至少我的願望是如此。</p>
<p>流浪流浪</p>
<p>他們一起二百七十餘人，男的，女的，老人，孩子，全都是不願在敵人鐵蹄下討生活而逃亡出來的流民。一直流浪，流浪，吃盡了千辛萬苦，挨到了今天，勝利後的今天。現在他們只有一個願望。回家！「我們要回家，回家—不管東北是怎樣的支離破碎，我們要回去看看！」者昨日冒着斜風細雨去，他們以低沉然而是坚實的話調如此告訴我。</p>
<p>「東北同鄉招待所」，那是一所破舊，無門無窗的屋子，在劫後南市的斷垣殘壁中間，更顯得凄愴，敗陋。入門便見陰濕的地上擱着簡單的一張張床舖，上樓——四壁徒然的破樓上，席地舖着日本式的「塌塌眠」，上面便三三兩兩躺着些東北流亡難胞。</p>
<p>趕着起來招呼記者的是個藍姓的大漢，和一位曾經畢業「陸大」當過參謀長的趙老先生。「我們大多是遼寗與吉林人」，藍君說，「有的出來了七八年，有的三五年。」又指着趙老先生說：「他九一八那時便隨着東北軍退出來了。」</p>
<p>他們大部是公教人員和編餘軍人，有的曾經隨着故于學忠將軍作戰於魯南；有的曾輾轉於中原太行山一帶前綫。有好幾位戰士，在疆塲上殉國了，他們遺留下的寡妻孤子便隨着大夥兒到了此地。記者順便曾提到了少帥張學良的祖母，詢以「是否也住在這裏？」他們證實了，但說是少帥的外祖母。</p>
<p>遙念故鄉</p>
<p>他們每一個都懷戀着故鄉。「我們的家鄉，大豆有小指這麼肥大，高梁有人一般的粗壯。」他們絮絮訴說着東北的富庶，土地的廣大，人民的稀少。「我們都有家，我們的家也都還在那裏，但是忍不了敵寇的侵凌，逃進關內來。以前我們冒着砲火，奔亡逃　，含辛茹苦，甘心情願，現在勝利了似乎再也沒有流浪的必要——我們要還鄉。」</p>
<p>但是還鄉也有困難，交通工具與川資是最大的問題，這裏（東北同鄉招待所）的負責人徐君告訴我：他們是由行總遣歸的第一批，有錢的同鄉早已紛紛設法走了。爲了資助難胞的還鄉，今年三月間纔創例組織了第一個東北旅滬同鄉會。出生於遼寧的丁貴堂曾盡了最大的熱心，他一直在奔忙着設法解決他們食宿的問題。</p>
<p>自尊心使東北同鄉們不願吐出乞憐的話語，但是憑着記者在廚房中的一暼，便推想得出每天啃着的那些粉質粗黄的　　，該不是怎樣合胃的食物。有幾個人病倒了，（因爲裏面骯　，蒼蠅也太多）。他們仅默默地出來找個廉價的大夫。可是最使我驚奇的，是當一個婦人古訴我：「這裏以前是同仁輔元堂放棺材的殯舍！」是麼，怪不得似乎還遺留着窒息的氣息——但是也畢竟躭下了四十來天了。</p>
<p>努力建設</p>
<p>記者很想知道他們回鄉後願意幹些什麽。趙老先生說：「我們願意盡一點一滴的力，幫着政府把東北建設起來。」到底斡什麼呢？到昨夜止還在跟莫德惠先生籌商，莫德老已答應帮他們安　。</p>
<p>雨止了一點，他們送我出大門，邊走邊說：「我們是明天就可以上船了，只是徐州各地還有一萬餘流亡同鄉要來，希望能多多呼籲，能不住這個不潔的屋子最好。」只有在苦難中的人們懂得扶助他人。苦難的同胞啊，願你們前　珍重！（仲實）</p>

<h3>世界第一游泳家　人猿泰山　韋斯摩勒　曾紐包辦世界谷項游泳記錄　一百碼自由式至今無人打破</h3>
<p>〔聯合社好萊塢六日〕「人猿泰山」韋斯摩勒，曾爲世界第一游泳家，韋氏棄泳從　雖已多年，但其保持之世界游泳記錄，仍未完全被打破。世界游泳記錄史上，曾有一時代，自五十碼至四百四十碼各項游泳記錄爲韋斯摩勒一手包辦，時至今日，五十一秒百碼自由式之記錄，仍爲其所保持。此一記錄最近被耶魯大學選手福特所威脅，但福特及任何人均不能創造五十秒以内之記錄。韋斯摩勒曾於一九二七年創造四九。八秒之記錄，人人難以置信，但此項記錄並未公認爲正式世界記錄，因在二十碼游泳池中創造，不合規則故也。韋斯摩勒今年四十二歲，對於游泳一項，已有美人遲暮之感，僅以高爾夫球爲主要消遣。但準備在一年內每星期游泳兩次，去年其百碼記錄爲五十三秒，今日能創造此項記錄者，亦不過少數人而已。韋氏於十五年前退出公開游泳比賽以來，眼見其所創各項游泳記錄均被打破，惟有百碼自由式記錄渠　或可保持相當時間。據韋氏稱：「今日之游泳好手，正受大學教總之訓練，此　教練太重視柔軟體操，殊不知水面以外，運動過甚，肌肉之發展，適得其反」云。</p>

<h3>戶政疑義解答</h3>
<p>問：我是上海人，已經在本區區公所報有戶口，現在我想到南京去做買賣，請問怎樣報請登記？本地人，一定是沒有「本籍」的了，你到南京去做買賣，假使是暫時的，不想在南京久住下去的話，這是「遷出原戶籍管轄區」，同時又不想「變更原所屬之籍」的人，只要辦遷出登記就可以了。</p>
<p>問：假使我想在南京久住呢？</p>
<p>答：這要分兩種来說：　假使在南京有久住的意思，决定願意除去本市的本籍的話，那可以一方面在本市申請除籍，一方面在南京申請設籍。　假使在南京想久性下去，但是因爲祖籍在這裏，或者有其原因，不願除去本市本籍的話，那你一方面還保有本市的本籍，一方面你要按部就班，未滿一個月，向原住地保長報流動人口登記，已满一個月，報遷出人口登記，注滿一年，可依照新戶籍法第十八條第二項「已有本籍而在他縣內有住所或居住一年以上者，以該縣爲其寄籍」之規定，申請設寄籍。</p>
<p>聞：什麽叫做「本籍」呢？</p>
<p>答：所謂「本籍」即所以確定某人與所居住的關係，認定某人在所居住地區配賦權利義務的標準。上海人在上海行使權利，履行義務，南京人在南京行使權利，履行義務。</p>
<p>問：什麽叫做「寄籍」呢？</p>
<p>答：所謂「寄籍」原爲濟「本籍」之窮，蓋某人在現住地已居有若干時間，對該地的情形，也相當熟識。一切權利義務，如須回到本籍地去行使履行，事實上不無困難，所以規定客地人，住滿一定期限，可以申請設寄籍。</p>
<p>問：本市的「本籍」人與「寄籍」人，行使權利履行義務，有無若何差異呢？</p>
<p>答：依照內政部卅二年二月十八日渝戶字第〇一四三號解釋令爲：「寄籍之規定所以濟本籍之窮，倘已在寄籍地居住，應即在寄籍地行使權利，履行義務，但權利義務所由賦予之法令另有規定者，則從其規定」，所以在原則上無甚差異。</p>

<p>一·籍別登記，因取得回復或喪失國籍而設籍或除籍者。</p>

<p>上海之有呢絨買賣，遠在民國紀元前三十餘年，但當時並無　式店舖運銷，自民國元年起，呢絨與西服二帮方陸續興起，後因服裝改革，呢絨行銷日廣，開設者如雨後春筍，乃有公會之組織，及民國十三五年間，西裝與大衣之穿着日衆，本街與客帮之需銷亦與日並進，華服衣料亦多選取呢絨，棋盤街大路帮勢力因之超過虹口拆貨幫矣，同英公會於是亦由虹口遷至上海區，往後呢絨各省市行銷逐年旺增，同業店號　設者林立，至今銷路之廣大，已超過　　之上，　　綢緞洋貨幫，大半無疑不　銷毛　品，而同業　　店逐步增加，在民十呢絨公會會員店號　四十家左右，二十二年爲七十五家，二十六年戰前爲九十四家，二十九年一百〇九家，三十一年三百四十一家，三十四年勝利之前四百十七家，本年三月一日整理接收正式成立係一百六十七家，按三十一及三十四年份內，因受敵僞管制，呢絨　動在二十碼以上者，須打運單，被迫加入者　　，同時因本市綢緞特殊，外行　戶下海者多，勝利後，初因幣制關係，加入者較形延遲，繼因物價頻漲，吃本加賞，開　增高，營業困難，合併與收閉着不少，三則加入公會後，公私開支負担不輕，義務或且多於權利，故多排徊觀望，此則近來會員所以减少之眞因也。　（　）</p>

<h3>印染原料與顏料化學</h3>
<p>— 章伯菴</p>
<p>自從潘更氏發明紫色以後，世界上染料工業，起了重大的革命，萬紫千紅，可在一室之內，分　煤膏Coaltar而完成其所欲，職務性之天然顏料，一降而千年不拔，不寗唯是，高級炸藥也，燃燒用　也，　氣瓦斯也，高貴藥物也，亦何莫不出於可爾泰一物，生殺之權，實操諸是項工業之乎。以此論之，染料工業，在平時，既爲民生工業之一大部份；而在戰時，更爲國家命脈之所擊，豈不偉哉。</p>
<p>染料之用煤焦油，其分　至爲精細，通常分苯，甲苯，二甲莽，　苯，　——石炭酸，苯，　，菲，　，等。以其分　溫度之高低，比重之高下，而分別之。苯酚爲輕油類，莽以下爲中油，蒽菲則皆重油類，焦油分　後，經過居間化合物之化合，即成爲五光十色之染料。</p>
<p>德國煤焦油工業，特別發達，多數發明，皆自德人所創始，德國乾　褐煤，技術之進步，世界各國讚歎不止，是以顏料化學，亦稱雄世界。德人利用煤膠，如此之廣，尚不足異；在歐戰以前，因煤源有枯竭之虞，所有煤膠衛生物，均就C．H．之分子式，分別用水電來解決，尤爲不可一世之傑作。</p>
<p>從有機化學原理上來說，礦氧化合物之合成，並不是不可能的事，而由德人一一實現之，試觀德人之合成苯酚以至於醋酸蟻醛之合成製品，就是用水電兩物來造成，其製造程序，光由蒸氣爐發出大量之蒸氣，此蒸汽經過紅赤之銅管，銅管內置有氨氣化鐵之多孔鐵海綿，蒸汽通過紅赤管後，此時水中之氧由於放射作用兒排除，而留得氧氣，氧氣導入於混氣球中，混氣球中裝置兩個弧光碳極，通以電流，此時水中之兩個氫原子與兩個碳極，起了化合作用成爲C　H　之乙　氣體，乙缺氧體再導入於赤熱管，　　起了聚合作用，而成爲C　H　，　　　苯，以次演變下去，就成　　　，丙朋　，　醛，以至於　　，莽蒽，均無不可，而合成製品，品質又毋須檢騐，是最純净不過的，據稱德人歐戰之航空燃料，咸贝此種方法而生產之苯而利用之，更是一頁不可摩滅的科學發展史，航空燃料，需要辛烷　　，而有滅　性的，故普通汽油內，原有苯之混入。作爲滅擊　的。</p>
<p>以上所說的爲染料之來源，但是，染料當中，右間接染料及直接染料，直接染料，按下不提，現在再來說間接染料，間接染色，是恃化學上之反應作用，其間重要者，有蒽（Anthracene）類以　陰丹士林（Indanthrene）。</p>

<h3>爭取和平與建設　請重溫八年艱苦抗戰史　（續完）</h3>
<p>……本報資料室……</p>
<p>南京失陷以後，敵人在華作戰的第二個軍事目標，就在於攻取　海津浦二路的中心—徐州。</p>
<p>由於韓復　的觀望不前，津浦北路的敵人以長驅之勢於十二月二十七陷濟南，一月四日陷兗州，十一日攻下濟寗，　縣，然後西向取嘉祥，以趨　德，企岡截斷　海路，包圍你州，但是這時我軍形勢已重新調整，二月初我軍反攻濟寗，轉戰至二月下旬敵人始得攻佔嘉祥，而從鄒縣南下攻滕縣的敵人亦遭到川軍王銘章部的堅强抵抗，一直到三月中旬才得佔領滕縣，王銘章將軍亦以是役陣亡。山東敵人的另一路攻勢則是從靑島沿公路下諸城，莒縣，西取沂水，以壓迫臨沂我軍右翼，其目的仍在威脅徐州，因而三月中又有臨沂的血戰，而敵不得逞。</p>
<p>敵人攻佔臨沂不得，轉而從津浦正面出棗莊嶧縣，直迫台兒莊，可是在台兒莊一役，我軍以機動的攻勢防禦，造成抗戰以來空前的勝利，殲滅敵人兩師團。四月下旬敵人增援，再犯臨沂。台兒莊，並取邳縣·郯城，但是我軍流動部隊與之犬牙交錯，牽制了他的進退。</p>
<p>爲完成徐州包圍的形勢，敵軍一面增兵蘇北東台，鹽城。一面從蚌埠，臨淮關取蒙城，永城。同時魯南敵軍分三路向向南進逼，然而徐州的我軍却在消耗敵人之後，於敵人重砲飛機威脅之下，突國澮河而撤退了。</p>
<p>徐州曾戰實在是一種戰略的勝利。</p>
<p>徐州既陷，敵人復於六月四日攻下開封，十二日黃河决堤。日軍撤退，於是掉頭向南，由合肥攻舒城陷太湖，再由太湖陷宿松黃梅，取廣濟，蔪水，黃陂；另一路由舒城向六安出固始，於十月十二陷平漢正面的信腸，柳林，公路南下，包圍武漢北面，同時長江敵軍亦於六月十三陷安慶，七月四日陷湖口，二十六日陷九江，向西進迫，至十月間三路包圍形勢業已吿成，然而我軍依照徐州會戰的經騐，主要是消耗敵人，側面作戰重於正面抵抗，相持數月，及至敵人形成包圍，我軍即於十月二十五日退出武漢。</p>
<p>先時敵人在武漢會戰中，累遭失利，又鑒於英法態度軟弱，乃毅然發唟華南戰事，於十月十二日登陸惠湯大亞灣，我軍未爲防範，以至廣州竟先武漢二日失陷。</p>
<p>武漢撤退以至次年三月的南昌會戰及南昌撤退，結束了第一期抗戰。在敵人已經深入到相當程度，其兵力的分配，隨着戰綫的延長，而漸漸達於飽和，不能再有餘力發動大規模的攻勢，而我們雖然損失了大批土地，主力並未損失，戰局因而達於相持的階段，這一期間，我們主要的任然在軍事上是穩住自己的力量，爭取主動，拖住敵人的泥足；在政治上是肅淸自己的陣營，鞏固團結。</p>
<p>所以當武漢撤退之後，蔣委員長又重新申述抗戰的一貫方針：「一曰持久抗戰，二曰全面戰爭，三曰爭取主動」。故「抗戰軍事勝負之關鍵，不在武漢一地之得失，而在保持我抗戰持久之力量。」同年十一月二十七日召開的南嶽軍事會議，委員畏的訓詞中，更强調第二期抗戰的任務是，轉守爲攻，轉敗爲勝，必定是加倍的艱苦，因而也要加倍的努力。</p>
<p>十二月十九日，汪精衛突然離職飛昆明，二十二日近衛發表所謂「建立東亞新秩序」之狂妄宣言，二十六日蔣委員長駁斥近衛宣言，而二十九日汪精衛　表艷電，這是武漢退撤以後，國內失敗主義者從抗戰陣營中淸除出去的一幕醜劇，然而抗戰的陣營却因此變得更純凈，更堅固，尤其是蔣委員長的嚴正言詞：「大家要注意他所謂新生中國，是要消滅獨立的中國，另外產生一個奴隸的中國，世世受其支配，而此項「新秩序」，則是根據於中國已變爲奴隸國家後與日本及其造成之「滿洲僞國」緊密聯絡而成，目的在什麽呢？以防赤禍的名義，控制中國的軍事；以擁護東洋文明的名義，消滅中國的民族文化；以排除經濟壁壘的名義，排斥歐美勢力，獨霸太平洋，再以「日滿支經濟單元」或「經濟集團」的工具，控制中國經濟的命脈。」</p>
<p>二十八年一月一日國民黨中央執行委員會常務會議，決議開除汪精衛黨籍，六月八日國府明令通緝汪精衛。</p>
<p>第二期戰事雖然在基本上已達於相持的階段，然而由於我軍自力不够，不能立於主動地位，而敵人還得以狼奔豕突之態發動其局部攻勢。</p>
<p>二十八年五月間，武漢敵軍因感我鄂北軍隊的威脅，發動所謂「隨棗會戰」，由襄河東岸向北迂迥之敵，先後攻佔棗陽，新野，唐河，而從信陽西犯敵亦陷桐柏，然而到五月杪，我軍增援反攻，先後收復各地，而且予敵重創。</p>
<p>同年九月間，南昌敵人會合鄂南長江之敵，企圖會攻長沙，轉載經月，到十月初我軍反攻，敵軍大潰，死傷在四萬以上，這就是所謂第一次長沙會戰。</p>
<p>然而十一月中敵人又在北海登陸，連陷防城，欽縣，並於廿四日攻佔邕寗。同時粵北方面，敵人亦分別攻佔琶江，英德，高田，新豐，翁源等地，互相策應，次年一月我軍反攻，雖相繼兄復增城，英德，高田，琶江，花縣等，但邕寗終陷敵手。</p>
<p>這便是相持階段的主要形勢，我方雖然還沒有力量完全停止敵軍的進攻，以致敵軍得在我各戰塲內繼續　動，但是敵人的攻勢顯然已不如第一階段的銳利打力，往往準備數月發動一次攻勢，一時也許佔領某些要衝，而一經我反攻，便全綫動搖，所以發乎沒有一戰役的結果不是敵人失敗了的。二十九年宜昌會戰，敵軍一面溯江西上，進叩宜昌門戶，一面自荊門陷常陽，拊宜昌之背，宜昌雖吿淪陷，然敵人也始終不能西逾縣城一步。同年的棗河戰役，張自忠將軍雖以身殉，然敵軍北限於伏牛，西阻於漢水，南僞大洪山所擋，東爲大別山所阻，我軍待機反攻，所向皆克。三十年敵人兩次發動長沙攻勢，兩次都吿失敗，尤其是九月閱的第二次長沙會戰，造成我軍在第二階段戰役中勝利的最高紀錄。三十一年四月浙贛戰役，敵軍企圖貫通浙贛全綫，一面從蕭山，諸曁西進，一面從九江南昌東擊，兩軍會師於貴溪，東鄉。浙贛綫打通之後，敵人更躊躇滿志，從寗紹金華一帶分兵南下，仙居，永康，送昌，麗水相繼淪陷。然而到七月中旬，我軍全綫反攻，在遂昌，宣平，永康之間予敵重創，浙東贛北相繼克復。三十二年五月皖北敵軍從安慶北上，陷桐城，佔立煌，但未及半年，即爲我軍擊退。同年十一月湖南敵軍從水西進，陷津市，縣，石門，渡水南取臨，慈利，直迫常德，更從陬市渡沅江，緊　包圍，我軍與之激戰，常德失而復到者三次，終於我大軍增援，將敵擊退，使敵人進攻陪都的迷夢歸於幻滅。</p>
<p>然而到此爲止，敵我相持已整整四年，敵人周然是愈戰愈疲，但我軍努力不够，始終未能完成相持階段之戰略任務，所謂爭取主動，轉守僞攻，甚且不能阻止敵人的繼續進攻。三十三年春，敵人因為在太平洋戰爭中的節節失利，他孤懸海外的百萬大軍無泆由海道歸國，於是不得不傾全力再作最後一次攻勢，以圖打通粵漢，平漢的交通綫，使他海外的軍隊能自大陸上撤退。四月十七日敵强渡中牟以西氾濫區，展開中原會戰，於二十二日侵佔鄭州，五月十五日攻佔洛陽，當其西進受阻於兩谷關，於是折而由平漢路南下，同時武漢敵軍亦北上與之會師於駐馬店，打通平漢路。六月中敵軍佔領長沙，沿鐵路犯衡陽，我軍苦戰兩月，終於八月八日退出，衡陽旣陷，敵人復於二十日南陷未陽。同時粵北敵軍亦沿粵漢綫北上，連下淸遠，英德，曲江，與南下之敵會師，至此平漢，粵漢兩綫都被打通，敵人氣燄高漲，不可一世。於是更循湘桂鐵路侵入廣西，於十一月十日佔領桂林，廣東敵軍亦循西江人廣西，蒼梧，柳州相繼淪陷。十二月桂敵趁勝犯貴州，竟於五日攻佔獨山，不過旋即爲我軍反攻克復，並將黔邊敵人肅淸，敵人長驅直入之勢，總算止住。</p>
<h3>何基豐將軍　談蘆溝橋戰役</h3>
<p>本報北平六日專電　特派員張劍梅</p>
<p>現任徐州綏署第七綏靖區副司令何基豐將軍，七七事變時任廿九車一一零旅長，曾親身指揮蘆溝橋之戰，記者本月二日憑弔蘆溝橋時，適與何將軍相逢於一文宇山，何氏方散步於此九年前一舊戰塲，此爲故友趙登禹將軍抗敵之地。何氏追述當年七七事變原委如後：七七事變前，廿九軍已知日軍備戰甚急，戰爭殆不能免，故藉騰出營房與受軍訓學生爲名，將西苑一一九及二三零兩團移至蘆溝橋長辛店一帶，豐台日軍亦藉演習爲名，至永定河一帶偵察地形。七月五日日軍尙通過宛平城蘆溝橋至河西演習，守軍亦未攔阻，七月六日，日軍又舉行演習，事先我軍偵知此次日軍出發，所携子彈且較平日爲多，必有奸計，故將宛平城門緊閉，拒絕其從城中經過。日軍乃折回。惟至晚又藉口昨日演習時曾失散兵了，要求入城尋找，我軍仍加拒絕七日日軍乃斷然發動侵略戰，天方亮時，牟田口聯隊第一大隊，即逼近大井村，用戰隊形向宛平及永定河平漢鐵橋前進，並開始砲擊。拂曉後，迫近宛平城，十一點佔領鐵橋，兩述守軍皆死於橋上。上午十時，我軍由西苑趕至八寶山旅部，即連下三令，令吉星文團長於日落前奪回鐵橋。吉團長乃選拔奮勇隊二百人以大刀衝殺，卒於日落前達到任務。此役日軍遺屍纍纍，故敵軍於八日即提議停戰，我方當予允諾。日軍即派軍使執白旗，將河邊河中橋上千餘屍體，用大卡車運往豐台。九日渠至長辛店祭死難官兵，回來時河東已槍砲大作。日軍之正而進攻，業已展開。我方即由西苑增加一團。十日奪回大井村，小井村，大瓦窰等地。日軍氣餒，故十一·十二兩日，一面向講回，一而自天津抽調河邊旅團，我方亦增加六個團，擬奪回豐台。十三日正午，北平當局臨時指示，不可反攻，乃止。十五日敵又砲擊宛平，吉星文在龍王廟，團部被擊傷。十六日日本田代中將親自督戰，宛平志在必得，午於大井村車站被我流彈擊斃。日人諉稱：田代剖腹自殺。十二日宛平若干房屋，被敵砲擊起火，我爲報復大井村，並砲擊鹽台，旋又奉令停擊。自十七日至廿六日，僅有小衝突。廿七日敵攻南苑，我亦擬將盧溝橋東敵驅退，曾攻入小并村，士兵登上房頂，與敵坦克戰，並攻克豐台，敵退守營房廿八晚，佟趙陣亡。南苑大勢已去。廿九日，宛平城守軍，續守一日，掩護大軍向門頭溝轉遷。卅日，任務完成，守軍始黯然放棄彼等固守廿四日之宛平與蘆溝橋。</p>
<h3>一幕歷史醜劇扮演者　漢奸案</h3>
<p>一個統計　個別懲治</p>
<p>隨着勝利到臨，全國各地熱烈展開了肅奸工作。但禁不起時間的冲滌，這些心頭舊創，似乎已逐漸爲人淡忘！時至今日，關於敵僞檢舉·審判·案件已屬不少。累年血債，償於一旦，允爲快心之舉。茲將過去審結漢奸與敵犯的情形，作一個統計，使大家知道這一幕歷史醜劇扮演者的角色，當爲國人所期盼，不過爲了時日已久，牽連亦多，而敵僞活動範圍又甚遼闊，記述缺漏，自所難免。</p>
<p>上海　迄本年六月底止，上海已經審結的漢奸案件，共爲一二一起牽涉一三六人。此外在逃，在通緝中，或在偵訊中者，爲數益夥，不在本文範圍之內。在已判決的一二一案之中，包括：經濟漢奸陳日平，李澤，唐壽民，袁履登等五人；文化漢奸陶亢德，章克，柳雨生，甘德雲等四人；政治漢奸胡澤吾，梁鴻志，劉星辰，蔡美堯，徐維震，趙鈺堂，劉偉俊，張德欽，唐惠民，湯良禮等四十人；供職敵憲及特工漢奸楊基昌，鄒文賢，方祖德，王世良等三十八人；軍警漢奸趙日光，蘇懷德，施輝耀等三十八人；資敵奸商傳光耀，惠文元，徐醉仁等五人；招工供敵漢奸周懿，江友根，左明，蔡運喜等四人。其中判處死刑的僅政治漢奸梁鴻志一人，無期徒刑的計陳日平，唐壽民，袁履登，楊基昌等十四人，其餘皆爲十五年以下的有期徒刑，最輕的判處一年又三個月。袁·聞·林「三老」開庭時，旁聽席上滿坑滿谷，甚至有向隅者。</p>
<p>江蘇　六月上旬，蘇州高等法院院長孫鴻霖，曾對記者發表：關於漢奸案件，高檢署自三十四年一月起，至三十五年五月底止，收受漢奸案件一千九百零六件，已提交高院審訊者，八百零四件，經高院審判終結者三百七十九人，內判處死刑者九人，無期徒刑者二十二人，有期徒刑者一百九十七人，諭知無罪者一百四十一人，論知不受理者十人，其餘四百二十五人，尙在審訊中。判處死刑的九人之中，除偽府主席天字第一號漢奸陳公博及僞立法院副院長繆斌已經執行外，尙宥褚民誼·張北生等七人。無期徒刑的二十二人，包括僞中委陳璧君，僞江蘇高院長沈文傑和常熟漢奸兪倫在內·當陳·褚等三巨奸在蘇公開審訊時，鬨動了整個蘇州城，旅舍中，車站上，擁擠了來自各方的遠客。他們不辭遠途跋涉，想一覩當代奸雄的盧山眞面，於此可見我民衆期望懲奸工作之殷切！</p>
<p>南京　首都「審奸」，如幾個僞組織裏的「部長」，梅思平，林柏生都判處死刑，李聖五因在僞司法行政部長任內施行大赦有功，减處徒刑十二年。僞府時期的三個軍事要員，楊揆一，凌　，胡毓坤都由軍法司判決死刑，並已在六月下旬執行槍決。値得注意的是汪逆的次子文悌，曾任僞尉校職，判處徒刑一年半，緩刑五年，審判官當庭勉以「學乃父的前半生，勿學乃父的後半生，重新做人，」可謂意味深長。</p>
<p>浙江　截至目前爲止，浙江省已判結的漢奸案件，計四十三起，其中判處死刑的有杭州市商會會長王五權，杭州敵憲密探長李實和，鄭耀春等三人；判處無期徒刑的有偽浙江民政應長張鵑聲等三人，僞浙江財政廳長陸善熾判徒刑十五年，僞浙江省黨部主任委員孫雪廬判徒刑七年，僞浙江日報總編輯何治平爲浙省文化漢奸中已被處徒刑之第一人，刑期爲三年六個月。</p>
<p>安徽　蕪湖奸商汪善誠，在敵僞時期，爲敵人搜購軍糧，狐假虎威，無惡不作，最近被判死刑，皖省人心爲之大快，同判死刑者，尙有安慶大漢奸徐先道，徐文彬二人。「合肥縣長」陳季波被處無期從刑，「合肥商會長」王平波判徒刑十年，「嘉山日報」社長被判無期徒刑，「蕪湖警察局長」鮑佐廷被判徒刑十五年，此外已判從刑者，尙有合肥各稅局局長及鳳陽保安隊隊附曲滌生等多人。</p>
<p>湖北　據漢口六四日來電：鄂高院本年四月份辦理懲奸案，計死刑三件，無期徒刑十一件，有期徒刑六十二件，無罪者三十八件。偽漢口市長石星川，僞「大楚報」總編輯張榆芳同被判死刑，爲文化漢奸中判刑最重之第一人。該報編輯劉漾然，處刑六年，記者張丙三處刑三年。僞鄂省敎育　長黃大中，僞高院長方忠源，偽省黨部委員歐陽洪烈均被處無期徒刑。</p>
<p>廣東　粵省曾發表一次通緝在逃漢奸名單，人數共計二百餘名，可見粵省漢奸，　網者居其多數。惟一經審訊，罪行屬實，則判刑頗重，其已在報章發表者，如偽粵省華僑隊伍會會長李超羣，僞民政　投英儒，僞中山日報社長駱鈞　以及女間諜黃美麗，皆判死刑。橫行一時之一澳門敵憲特務長黃公傑，則在越一獄時被守衛擊斃。</p>
<p>福建　閩高院去年十二月至今年四月底止，計受理漢奸案六十件，已結四十三案，計徒弄十六件，因逃匿通緝者十三件，餘均無罪。偽廈門市長李思寶則被判死刑。</p>
<p>河北　冀省包括平津在內，已審結之漢奸案，計十八件，其中最令人矚目者爲伶人李萬春以通敵罪，被處徒刑二年半，文化女奸，青青女中校長尹梅伯判處徒刑五年。至華北第一號巨奸王克敏已病死獄中，其餘「華北政務委員會」巨奸一批，以情節重大，業於六月中旬自北平以飛機　運至首都，陸續在受審中</p>
<p>山西　晋省審結之漢奸，判處死刑者計有僞汾西縣長，僞山西防共自衛團長李仰文等八名，判處無期徒刑者有容福瑞一名，處徒刑者五人。</p>
<p>青島　僞青島市長姚作賓，保安隊副總隊長薛從之，均被判處死刑。</p>
<p>廣西　桂省漢奸周韋善，以通敵充任嚮導罪名，又王視國以通敵供給食米罪名，皆判處徒刑二年半。</p>

<h3>論國畫</h3>
<p>— 賀天建</p>
<p>談繪畫的理法，總是千篇一律；下要說看的與聽的生厭，就是談的人也覺得厭倦了；所以談慣繪畫的人似乎有點不想談；且不願談呢。我不作談畫的文字，實實在在有多年了；現在再來談談：在這裏應得提倡幾條來做一個破題兒：</p>
<p>第一條是：我們中國有繪畫的！</p>
<p>第二條是：我們中國的繪畫是這樣！</p>
<p>第三條是：世界上的畫：西畫與中國畫兩種！</p>
<p>第四條是：國外人亦要看中國的國畫！</p>
<p>第五條是：我們中國人應提倡中國的國畫！</p>
<p>第一條是表示我們這樣萬世不如人的民族，居然也有自己創造盯繪畫，並不曾把人家的繪畫當作自己的，並且也曾給人家（日本）拿去當作自己的。這一點似乎也　自誇一下！</p>
<p>第二條是表示我們中國的繪畫有數千年的過程，已經成就它的體格與地位：它的力量與價值當然不能隨便與以膜視，它有性靈化與人格化底超現實超自然的主張，營養它的基本資料是要「讀萬卷書行萬里路」。况且西畫偏重生物而於我們所謂山水畫者彼尚未及到，雖有風景畫如野外寫生等不過一種模倣自然而做一番描寫工作而已。我們山水畫的確爲世界畫壇上所驚奇而注意者，业且它從自然對象之描寫而至於「抒寫胸中邱壑」「造化在手」之境地了，更且要寫「胸中逸氣」而與以氣息上之修養了。</p>
<p>一種畫事但有實質上之工夫，無有氣息與靈感，是不能稱爲美善的，我們的國畫（山水畫）它的具備有這樣！</p>
<p>第三條是證明我們中國的國畫與西畫各執東西兩牛球畫壇之牛耳，它有它的性格，我有我的性格，它代表着西方的精神文化，我代表着東方的精神文化，更申說一句：我們中國的國畫尤其是代表着我們中國人的精神與性格，原因是我們黃帝子孫精神上所產主的東西。</p>
<p>第四條是：繪畫是文化特徵之一種，好比花：一稱花有一種花的色與香及它的形式，不過人之比花當然沒有這樣簡單，象人之看花一望即能得其香色與形熊。人之能畫不能晝要非表演出來不能知道。近年來英國，美國徵收了我們的國畫去展覽，就是這個例證；你有什麼香味應得也給我聞聞，大家應該相互地欣賞欣賞。這是友好的情意表現，在這時候我們應該大家盡力出點好的作品，到友好各國去展覽展覽。使人家曉得我們怎樣一個有文化的民族。</p>
<p>第五條是凡任何一國人固然不必一定只許畫它的自己畫，也可以畫畫不是自已的畫；藝術之好，沒有限止的，儘管自由地學習，不過耘人之田而遺棄了自己的圖地，是對不起祖先與後代及自己的，這是一種機嚴格的責任，應該努力地學習與推進。薪指相傅綿綿不絕，例如宋與元的時代光華燦爛，在文代史上做成一段「　　奂焉」的記載。多麼有價值，我們也應當踏着前　　上去。</p>
<p>話是好象說完了，可是想想還有幾句話要說一說；近来各報上的附刊內每每對於國畫有評論或紀述登着，有的要來改造，有的要維持，有的要廢棄，有的要發揚，熱心是熱心極了，不過醫生治病沒有得到病源與病理，是萬不可以下藥的，在這種時候病人心焦沒有用，醫生心焦也沒有用，看戲的人說台上做戲的做得不好，有人說你何弗上去做做，看的人倒也不能去做，但是說他好不好倒要說的，這也於事無補的。看事容易做事難，向來是這個樣子的。我們中國的國畫：說句忠實的話在現在不可不算沒有出息：說進步固然還早；但是山水畫比較二十年前要好得多了，二十年前的山水畫，是怎樣一種畫；乃小四王派到山窮水盡的境地，說筆罷，筆，都是立不起來的；說墨罷，墨，都是染不出墨彩的。山山是灰堆，樹樹是掃　；要知道國畫並沒有不注重形似，它大前提就是要畫人就要像人要畫山就要像山；否則。也不必要有什麼人物山水的名稱了，形似了以後再諭及其它；如筆墨罷，意境罷，韻味罷，氣息罷，一　腦兒裝進去，要是畫山水像山畫人不像人，一塌糊塗，即使要裝進以上許多東四也裝不進了：就是你要去捧它塲或袒護它，就是文人畫，或者說是逸品神品，然而張天師的符：它能彀去逐鬼怪，人家也不去管它像什麽了；這是功用的關係。畫則不然；終究要像件什麽東西的。至於說蘇東坡有「論畫以形似，見與兒童鄰，」之主張，乃是級段的片面的，我的意思是說你論人家畫的畫只注重形似及單憑形似而論是非，是不興的？應該還要加進及　到別的東西。（以上所述幾種）方才好得到其平。如果你也把東坡此說作如是觀，那末東坡被你冤煞了；同時也誤畫蒼生了。所以神品逸品文人畫等等名銜應該要加在形似基本之上，是整個而完備的批評。</p>
<p>二十年前的時候亡友江小　看見我作論畫的文字，他說你是畫家不應該兼做評畫家，歐州如法國等地藝術理論有藝術理論家，藝術有藝術家你不要犯這個規。我覺得不大合理，我起而抗議；我說一個沒有藝術修養與藝術習作經騐的人他那里會曉得「箇中甘苦」他一定「隔靴搔痒，」如對於「丈二和尚摸不着頭腦」的；「事非經過不知難」這句話，是一點不差的！我堅决主張藝　理論家一定要藝術家做，他也沒有辦法他只好　我幹了。弗料我做了之後漸漸地人事應酬一天一天忙起來了。爲什麽呢：要我做捧塲文字的人說：你同我們做捧塲文字比較力量來得大；我問他何以故呢，他們就說，因爲你是一個畫畫家啊！後來我細細地一想，這事不好再做了，因爲人情是無可拒却的；倘使是非顛倒好壞不分，到那是教我怎樣地容忍，我就不做這種文字了，歇了許多時候，我有個好友對我說：天健：你不號放棄掉批評家之地位。因爲沒有權位是要給人家播弄的，我說我不管牠了，橫豎我決受不到牠們的好懷影響，是與非乃是天地自然的定律，一時的毁譽何足重呢。假使你要重視一時的冷熱，那未對不起　勢之門不能少你的足跡，熱鬧塲中那裏可以不去，營業關係，廣告費是應該列入資本之內的，不能不用心計不用手腕啊！然而一個不小心，對不起，在敵僞時期出風頭的到現在就要加上你一項附逆附勢的帽子呢！實則在這種人他決不會怕的，因爲有趙子昂張瑞圖王　等人的前例他作只倒也一樣值錢的，並且罵出名是比捧出名來得容易！所以一個老朋友笑我說你還是一個傻子呢；罷，我願意做傻子一生了。不過畫的理論文字我仍舊要做的，捧人罵人文字決不做；我自己也不願意在現在出什麽壓倒一切的風頭。某大家某大家的名銜。無論如何我要奉　還趙的：話說得太多了將要出題目範圍了，其實恰在園中。你要曉得國畫現在的環境與內在，這以上所說都有關係的；這篇文字結論是批評家應該忠實地賢明地來批評，如果不懂，萬萬不要技　。作者自己應該老老實實研究下去守住了自己崗位，不要去管他一切。完成我的天職。要切切知道我們中國有自己的畫啦！人家要來看看你的！</p>
<h3>名畫與名家</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>一　田園畫家米勒及其代表作</p>
<p>米勒（Jean　Francois　Miller　1814—1875）是法國巴比仲派田園畫家羣中的一員火將。他是近諾爾曼海岸的一個寒村的農夫之子。他有一個慈仁能幹的祖母，料理着整個的家務。他的父母是終日在田間勞動的，米勒也和其他農夫之子一樣的每日在田間帮着他父母工作；同時也跟着他父母在每日早晚在田間作一次祈禱。祖母又是個老宗教家，因之，他自小慣見的繪畫，全是宗教的宣傳畫，而他就把這些畫作爲範本，一度再度的臨摹，同時石筆與石板就成爲他一刻不離的隨身法寶。這樣的行動，慢慢的就引起了祖母的注意。於是她就說：「佛朗梭是具有成功華家的素質的」。</p>
<p>米勒的名字中的佛朗梭（Francois）是他祖母從教堂中討來的。（由阿西之聖者「佛朗西斯」名字化出來的）他還有一個叔父，是當地的宣教師，也發現了米勒的天才，並認爲非給他求學不可。於是就教他學習臘丁語，教他唸馬可福音，他並下討厭而且很用功。逢到下雨不能外出的日子，就在家中四壁上亂畫，把他每日慣見事物作爲題材。一日，走正路上看見一個老嫗由遠處　磨　　的踱過來，他頓時感到興趣機濃，急忙由袋中掏出一根木炭，將那老嫗的形態速寫在壁上。附近村人見了，皆爲之大驚，那老嫗的神態被他畫得活靈活現，嘆爲天下奇觀！這消息，傅到了他父親耳裏，就此决計將他送到巴黎去。</p>
<p>到巴黎，光入浪漫派作家戴拉洛其（Delaroche）畫室。因其出身農村，一到繁華之都，不免飽受巴黎學生的嘲笑與愚弄，然他的成績單竟超羣，終於克服了敵人一躍而成爲該畫中的佼佼者了。</p>
<p>不久，他就和同鄉舉行了婚禮，因爲生活就爲市坊各雜誌作插圖，晝裸女畫。大受一股之攻擊，獲此刺激後，就毅然决然的離開了巴黎，逕向　方登布魯相近的巴比仲村去住下。於是來自田間的人依然回到了田間，從此就從事描寫田間的景象了。</p>
<p>一八四九年，米勒已三十歲了，終於以「撒種者，一入選於巴黎沙龍展覽會，引起了一般批評家的注意，素以貴族生活——富貴榮華爲題材而作畫的巴黎　　，突入其來的發現了這樣一張平民畫，自然不會寫大多人同情的，甚於有人罵他「下流一，一低級」和「醜惡」。</p>
<p>描寫田園風趣的畫，嚴格的說，到並非米勒首創，早在十七世紀的荷蘭已經有過，那時的所謂田園畫的題材眞才是專門暴露農民的醜態和弱點——大笑，大食，愚笨，野　爲題材的。而米勒之作則不同，他用熟練細膩的技巧描寫青白可親的農人每日忠貞不倦的神聖的工作，從一粒粒的種子撒在田間，出了汗，用了力，終於獲得辛苦挨來的　政，「劃　」與「拾穗」就是一撒種」後的傑作。當時雖受盡了冷嘲熱諷，現在終於都成爲世界的名作了。</p>
<p>此外，如「樵夫」，「晚鐘」，「收歸」都是他的代表之作，爲美術史上留下了燦爛光輝的一頁，「藝術下鄉」，米勒是第一人，也是最成功的一個，他一生沒有畫過一張名人像，也沒有爲榮華富貴的大人們作過幫兇凹。出身清貧，死後亦僅僅　下田園畫幾幅而已。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（七八）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>石玉樓吸完烟，兩眼發楞地直瞪着螢火的燈頭，淚光閃灼在灰黯喪。</p>
<p>「玉樓，你怎麼啦？不舒服嗎？」翁二太太詫異地問他，心裏有些　咕。</p>
<p>「沒什麽。大概是累了。」石玉樓言不由衷地說。</p>
<p>「那麼你就歇着吧，別再累壞了，才好一點兒。」翁二太太說着替他盖好被子</p>
<p>「嗯，也該歇着啦！」石玉樓語直心長地說罷。悄悄彈了兩滴淚。</p>
<p>翁二太太當時沒有意識出石王樓這句話的雙關意思。便又去洗她的衣服了。洗完衣服，她看了看石玉樓沒有什麽動靜，只偶而咳嗽兩聲，以爲石王樓確是累着了，因此不免替他身體發愁。不讓他再唱戲吧，生活又没法維持。「如果麗雲也像麗華那樣有出息，不是什麽問題都解決了嗎？」想到這裏，翁二太太不禁爲自己叫屈！原以爲嫁給了石玉樓可以過點快活日子了，誰知偏又是這般事事不稱心。翁二太太的命運可算是夠壞的了！，她已經沒有什麽希望了，只希望石玉樓的病快點好起來。只要有石王褸在她的身邊，日子再苦，她也情願！她還是像在荆州時那樣地熱愛着石玉樓。儘管她老了；石玉樓也老了；伹她的心並沒有變；石玉樓在她的眼裏，依然還是不减當年的美！</p>
<p>但是，翁二太太的唯一希望終於又破滅了！第二天早晨，翁二太太一覺醒來，她睜開眼一瞧，發現石玉樓已不在床上了。她便連忙起來到墨太太屋裏；以及　所裏；都找通了，可是，石玉樓的影子也沒有。於是她有些慌！因爲石玉樓從來不曾這樣早就起床的，再想到昨晚上的情形，她更惶恐了，她預感到一個最大的不幸就要臨頭！</p>
<p>果然，直至下午，才有人從中央公園的北海找着了石玉樓，但是他已經閉上了眼睜，他是那樣悠怨地，疲　地長此離開了這個世界而去「歇着」了，</p>
<p>翁二太太快瘋了！她抱着石玉樓冰冷的屍首狂呼，狂哭！</p>
<p>這慘狀，深深刺激了麗華的靈魂！她彷彿覺得那死的不是石玉樓，是她自己—是一個未來的自己！於是，她同時爲自己哀悼！爲一個正在學着石玉樓後塵的未來的自己哀悼！</p>
<p>墨太太，以及石玉樓的同行，大家忙着爲這位倒下來的優伶辦後事。這時，誰都沒有想到，當天的夜裏，翁二太太也眼着石玉樓走了，她用洗衣服的錢，買了二兩煙　吃下去。（她作夢也料不到，這原打算買來給石玉樓過　的煙膏，却被她用爲自盡的工具）於是墨太太他們又接着辦第二件後事。</p>
<p>石玉樓應當瞑目了！在這個　海浮沉的世界上，終觉還有一個翁二太太不曾遺棄他。</p>
<h3>音樂的欣賞</h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>音樂家在諸姊妹藝術中，和人類生活的關係最爲深切，和大眾的關係也最普遍。每個人都有表現感情最直接的樂器—歌喉，當內心有所感的時候，便可以發爲歌聲而成音樂，不像其他藝術的需要材料和工具，表現感情的麻煩，因爲音樂是直接地從內心表出，她誘導人的力量偉大而深切，從音樂的效果來講：可以調節我們的疲勞，愉快我們的精神，增進我們的工作的效能，音樂實是精神生活上所必需的營養物。</p>
<p>音樂藝術爲大眾所愛好，差不多人人喜歡聽音樂，也人人會唱歌，除了感官特殊的例外，可是能夠理解音樂的却佔少數，祇要聽一般所歌唱的音樂，便可知道。這些歌曲大都旋律缺少變化，節奏簡單，和聲也不豐富，如普通的歌謠曲，電影歌曲及舞曲，進行曲之類。如果聽到高深奥妙的音樂，他會感得意倦而沒有興趣，這就是缺乏音樂素養的明證。</p>
<p>那末音樂要怎樣才能理解？這步功夫必需培養欣賞的能力。不論那一種藝術品，對於欣賞一項，非常重要。音樂在藝術中是深藏的，不若其他的藝術品，有形體，色彩，或文字存在空間。如繪畫，工藝品的可以看。詩歌的可以讀。音樂這樣東西，由空漠廣泛的音連結而成，是一種抽象的藝術。欣賞時全憑着我們的聽覺和想像力，從無形中去領略它的情趣，所以欣賞音樂比欣賞其他的藝術品來得難，而理解音樂更難。</p>
<p>欣賞音樂不僅僅乎用着我們的感官就行，我們聽到悅耳的音調，發生一種快感，這不過是音樂的感覺上的美。猶如我們看到自然界的美色，感覺愉快一樣。音樂是理智的產物，極注重曲體結構的美，於感覺的欣賞之外，更須進一步的欣賞，運用我們的理智，去研究樂曲的結構和形式，才能體味到更深切的情趣。</p>
<p>音樂雖是直接的感情表現，那是用種種暗示感情的音，來誘導人們的內心，引起快樂或悲哀的感情的。所以我們對於欣賞音樂，除感覺的美，理智的美以外，要獲得欣賞音樂的效果，必須欣賞音樂的感情。用理智的根基。培養豐富的記憶力，運用銳敏的想像力去意會，我們要瞭解樂曲的感情，並須探求作者的個性和環境。</p>
<p>總括的講：欣賞音樂要感覺的，理智的感情的，欣賞音樂必須準備欣賞音樂的能力，這種能力要經過相當時間的训練，逐漸地培養起來。</p>
<p>生產建設特輯</p>
<h3>中國農業用具及機械　㈡</h3>
<p>— 鐘德祺譯</p>
<p>據正確的統計，美國利用農具及機械之費用爲農具價值百分之二十。中國之資金利息亦遠較美國爲高，同時農具亦不如其耐用，上面計算之中國農具投資利率是用百分之二十，較各地之現行利率稍低，總之，平均每畝農具之費用是受所工作之畝數多少所影響的。</p>
<p>一種實際簡單計算農具使用費用之方法，是以生產借款之利率乘農具之市塲價格。農具折舊百分率可以農具壽命年數之倒數計算，例如，壽命爲廿年，則每年之折舊率爲百分之五，再將一年所有修理及其使用費用（如油）一併加入計算得使用費用。當此投資利息，折舊費用，使用費用三種一倂加起時之結果，即爲農具使用之費用。而每作物畝之費用可由作物畝書除其費用即得。（第一表）如有一部農具爲租借或貸入者，則須另加計算。</p>
<p>（單位元）</p>
<p>農具估值（二七·七〇元）　五·五四</p>
<p>折舊（百分之五）　二·四〇</p>
<p>使用費用（包括修理）　三·四五</p>
<p>每農塲農具之使用總費用　一一·三九</p>
<p>每作物市畝農具之使用費用　〇·三六五（一一·三九元除以三一·二作物市畝）</p>
<p>每作物市畝之農具估值　〇·八九（二七·七〇元除以三一·二作物市畝）</p>
<p>農具使用總費用佔農具估值之百分率　四一（以〇·八九元除〇·三六五元）</p>
<p>第一表　一九三五年度中國中東部各省每農塲平均每年使用農具之費用（註一）</p>
<p>各種不同農具及農業機械使用之費用比較，可用此種方法計算。可求得任一農塲作業之全部費用，例如犁地，就必須要加入人力和動力（役畜或機械費用），在中國以各種不同農具經營同一作業之比較研究中，可以看出每種農具費用與利潤之關係。在一九三五年，鋤耕每市畝之費用爲〇·二六元，用牽　機僅五〇·〇七元，用鐮刀收穫每市畝費用爲〇·一九二元，而用　　則僅爲〇·〇六元。</p>
<p>新式機械</p>
<p>在南京附近農場中曾作過下列比較計算，即　用水牛一頭拉犁和用一部牽曳機。　用運　打　和用打　機（第二表）。根據這些結果，牽曳機的費用超過水牛兩倍以上。如果牽曳機整地較佳，生產量較多：則因增加生產而增加之勞力費用，應從估計之牽曳機之費用中减除。</p>
<p>第二表。用水牛犁地及牽曳機之費用比較</p>

<p>總計六八九·二〇（元）</p>
<p>九〇〇市畝每市畝之平均費用　〇·七五（元）</p>
<p>一五〇英畝平均每英畝之費用　四·五九（元）或（美金一·三七元）</p>
<p>打　機與牽曳機之比較，雖然前者每年只能用十五天，但在中國之食油較牽曳機爲合算，金陵大學使用小型打　機之結果，說明其余用鐮刀同樣經濟，而獲得純淨之產品，每二三又三分之一鎊之費用爲〇·五四元，與一把鐮刀之〇·五五元之比較相近，但利用新機械之另一困難間題爲草桿不能如用鐮刀之硬直，不適用於蓋屋，在中國南部，更須有能搬動打　機之道路（譯者按：南部之田　機狹），伹打　機在農忙時可節省時間，可把打　及收穫二種作業一次合併完成，因而除收　節省勞力之效外，並可减少穀實損失。</p>
<p>在長江下游需灌溉之地，灌水機之引用，爲使用新式農具成功之例證，蓋水稻需要之水分極多，故在距水較遠之區，靠人力灌溉是不够的。</p>
<p>引用現代農　機械的可能性，不僅根據經濟原則，而且也要視農塲之佈置情形而定，如田塲過小和下規則；道路過狹，　機械不能作有利之利用。若耕地加以整理或重劃，擴大農塲是可能的，近來美國已將機械改小，如果能蓋量减低其價格，則有些機械中國是可能利用的。（未完）</p>

<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>在生產機購方面，應該加以討論的，有下列各種問題：　廠房　人事　原料　製造　運輸。關於廠房一點，已經在上面說過了，現在不妨把其餘各點，按次加一討論。</p>
<p>人事</p>
<p>這裏所說的人事，是限於人事的支配，並不是人事的管理，因爲人事管理，將在生產機構之後，詳加討論。</p>
<p>當我們從發起以至公司成立，建造廠房，這時候對於重要職員的支配，也應該部署定當了，無論什麽事，都是要人去做的，所以人事的支配，對於事業的成功失敗大有關係。</p>
<p>這裏所說的人事的支配，是以生產爲立塲而加以討論的，普通的商號，沒有生產的工作。組織就比較簡單，在一個經理之下，有進貨，銷售，會計等幾個部份，已經可以把日常事務處理得很順利了。</p>
<p>關於人事的支配的最大目的是使各人的責任分清，其次是使工作進行順利，有了組織，就可以由各個部份編製預算。</p>
<p>簡單地說來，一個公司的主要部份，不外生產，銷售，和業務三個部份，現在不妨把這幾方面加以論述：</p>
<p>（甲）關於主管部份：通常情形，一個公司的最高職員是總經理，（在股份有限公司，那末列在表格的最高層的是股東大會，下面是董事會，再下面是總經理，總經理有時候由董事長，常務董事或董事兼任，如果只有一人，那末不必用總經理名目，而用經理名目）</p>

<h3>米到哪裏去了</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>跑遍了一條北四川路上的七八家米店，沒有買到一斗米，這種狼狽的情形，即在抗戰時期的大後方，我們也從未遇到過，這是一個什麼世界，是一批什麽吸血鬼，什麼魔王在作崇？</p>
<p>糧貸案逐漸沉寂了，我們要追問它的下文，在還沒有水落石出之前，如今，上海似乎成爲無米的都市了，這顯然其中有人在操縱，在擺他的「顏色」。</p>
<p>報紙上天天登着幾千担幾千担到了，配給了幾千担幾千担，什麽安南米，巴西米，江西糙米，天曉得，我跑了七八家米店，我沒有買到一粒。</p>
<p>每家米店大門敞開，夥計們抽着烟欣賞街景，而米袋米櫃都是空空如也。</p>
<p>「不是有配給米交給你們賣的嗎？」我問。</p>
<p>「我們四五天前申請的，直到現在還沒有配給到。」夥計答。</p>
<p>「喂！我不管價錢，你說好了」。</p>
<p>「先生，實在沒有，有，爲什麼不賣呢？」</p>
<p>「那你們開了門幹什麽的！」我有點憤怒。</p>
<p>「不開門要吊銷執照的，我們也沒有辦法呀！」</p>
<p>「喂，到底什麼地方可以買得到，朋友，幫幫忙好不好！」</p>
<p>「天后宮橋，自來火街，虬江路，有挑担的，有攤頭，都在賣。」</p>
<p>另一個夥計得意地笑了一笑，接着說：「米店也在打遊擊了。」</p>
<p>以上是我昨天買米的一個經過，我忠實地紀述在這裏，我相信這决不是我一個人所遭遇的情形。</p>
<h3>第一次</h3>
<p>— 登薈</p>
<p>「第一次」是個魔鬼的名字，自從人類「良心」上有了「不安」以後，它就悄悄地降臨到人間。當「第一次」未來之時，人類的「良心」是平靜得像古井裏的水；因此，人類糊塗了—是「第一次」帶來了良心的不安呢？還是良心的不安帶來了「第一次」？這問題就像究竟鷄生蛋呢還是蛋生鷄一樣地莫明其妙。</p>
<p>照理，現在是原子時代囉！像「第一次」這樣的一個魔鬼，早就應該聞原子而匿跡，然而不，「第一次」在人類的良心上已奠定了何等鞏固的基礎？它的手腕已使人類的良心，從痛恨它變成同情，從厭惡它變成諒解。</p>
<p>現在，「第一次」的勢力網已漫佈到整個的人類世界。這世界已被「第一次」造成怎樣的面目了！你瞧！</p>
<p>有人正在用强暴的手　　汚一個少女，少女掙扎不過，貞操破壞了！在他，是第一次。</p>
<p>有人正在用第三隻手伸進別人的袋裏，抽屉裏，銀箱裏……第一次。</p>
<p>有人竟公然的拿着武器，將你的財產大模大樣地搬了去。</p>
<p>有人一家老小不過六個人，家裏却堆着百多担白米，還有哩！棧房裏還有哩！</p>
<p>有人投機失敗，金條却反而多了幾十根。</p>
<p>够了！够了！我不過是揀這些小事來證明「第一次」和人類良心的關係罷了！</p>
<p>當這些被「第一次」魔化而良心發生不安的人們，當他們良心的不安被人證實而公開的時候，請聽他們怎麽說：「請原諒我「第一次」吧！我實在是犯的「第一次呀！」於是，人們買了「第一次」的鬼面子，來一個「姑念初次無知，從輕發落。」或竟認爲無罪，口頭上訓斥一下：「無論如何可不能再上「第二次」的當啊！」於是，那些不安的良心重新安了下來；而「第一次」也就更形猖獗了！</p>
<p>乾脆地讓我揭破「第一次」的野心吧！它所採取的是一種「攻心戰略」，「魔化政策」！它要將整個人類的良心變成魔鬼的惡心，它要將整個人類的世界變成魔鬼的世界！</p>
<p>大部份的人類世界，已被改變了原有的眞善美模樣，這樣下去，人類未來的命運？你去想吧！</p>
<p>撇開你自己這一代說：「你願意你的子孫生活在一個凄凉黑暗恐怖殘酷的魔鬼世界裏嗎？」</p>
<p>「善言相勸」已不能挽回這時代的危機了！</p>
<p>「知過必改」對于這些被「第一次」魔化的人簡直就是奢望！</p>
<p>警吿全世界正義的人類！決不能再饒恕「第一次」這惡魔了！凡借「第一次」鬼名作惡的「良心」，我們必須毫不留情地消滅它！同時，你——人類中的一個，更須積極地預防「第一次」潛入你寶貴無邪的心田！</p>
<h3>從救濟品說起</h3>
<p>— 陳中繩</p>
<p>救濟品之最先見於報紙的，是葡萄乾·波蘿蜜。最近在報上出名的救濟品是奶粉，其中沒有救濟米，那是因爲美國不產米的緣故吧？麵粉似乎聽說過，但實際上還是奶粉後來居上。</p>
<p>葡萄乾·波蘿蜜和奶粉，都是上品；救濟當局賑濟我們，一定是煞費苦心。他們有意提高中國人的生活水準，使眞正成爲四強之一。</p>
<p>救濟與傾銷不能相提並論，傾銷是低價廉售。所以克寗奶粉傾銷後，惠民奶粉退出市面隱居了。但是救濟却是一個子兒都不要的，傾銷品可以打倒國產品，而救濟品旣然一文不要，一定會打倒傾銷品。至於救濟品與國產品有什麼關係呢？一時覺得有些糊塗了。</p>
<p>美國商務部預算每年出口品，廣吿費二十五億美元，不知道美國的廣吿品何時到中國來？已經來過了沒有？不過救濟品該不是廣吿品吧？同胞們要是不大明自，惟有去請敎我們的施主。</p>
<p>奶粉是救濟品，豆腐漿是國產品。常語說：「只能救急，不能救窮」。可見救濟品不是永久的。假如在停止救濟之前，我們已經把奶粉吃上了癮，那末在停止救濟後，我們還是吃傾銷品的奶粉呢，還是吃國產品的豆腐漿州呢？我看豆腐漿是吃不成了。一則豆腐店已經改行爲奶粉經銷處，一則吃慣了奶粉就吃不慣豆腐漿了。</p>
<p>我以爲還是現在拒吃奶粉，繼續吃豆腐漿最妙，因爲把奶粉吃上了癮後，一旦奶粉不傾銷，來路斷，你就得逼上梁山，吃囤積品了。</p>
<p>乖乖，題目是救濟品，竟寫到了囤積品，未免逕庭不近人情了！</p>
<h3>公園所見</h3>
<p>— 痴墨</p>
<p>到公園裏去坐坐或是散步呢，時間最好是在早晨，不過我說的早晨，倒並不是因爲早晨的空氣新鮮，而由於早晨的公園中到處有特寫的鏡頭可見。如果過了這個時候，那麽公園裏的一切，就顯得平淡，所有花木，正與椅子一般的沉默，所以早晨的公園是充滿着蓬勃的朝氣，是以我之往公園的時間是刻板在早晨。</p>
<p>公園門口的規則條文中，明明禁止園內踢球的，記得在巡捕房時代，巡捕看見遊客帶球，他不問你踢不踢，就不客氣地來一個沒收，現在呢，說是民主了，也就禁不得，因此小皮球踢到大皮球，還有拍羽毛球的，有些兒童們，運道不好的話，遂中了流「球」，當然鼻靑眼腫，有時還當塲掛彩的淌了大堆鼻紅血，在「犬與華人，不准入內」的時期，類乎這種的不幸事件，絕對沒有發生過.</p>
<p>也許是失業伶人，一天一天有得增加，他們不能在合上唱戲，就流亡到公園裏來了，收一幫徒弟，房飯鈿也有了着落，以前公園（以顧家宅公園而言）內每天早上要刀舞棍的僅一班，可是現在啊，東團着一大堆的人在看打拳頭，西也圈了個大圈子看單槍破雙刀，南也有，北也有，那邊有，這邊也是，正有不知若干，而且男女皆有，看客圍得水洩勿通，甚至有些人還特地爬上樹而居高臨下看的，當每一個節目表演完畢，四週的看客倒很有禮貌，一定鼓一陣掌。</p>

<h3>三人會議　太嚴肅了</h3>
<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>三人會議開會時，大家圍坐在一張極平凡的長桌上，馬歇爾坐在正中，政府代表靠右邊坐，中共代表靠左邊坐。似乎給我們一個很明確的概念，一邊是「左」的，一邊是「右」的，而馬使是一個不左不右的。</p>
<p>每次開會，馬歇爾向來不預備「政治宴」的，非等到會議完畢後，各人吃各人的飯去。因此有人疑心到這是談不好的因素之一。因爲中國人在吃飯的時候，是最容易談得很投機的；如果「政治宴」中能够利用猜拳助興，彼此大姆指一伸，高聲喊個「哥兒倆好」，你猜這是多麼來勁。說不定眞個哥兒倆從此好起來！但是，可惜的；馬歇爾究竟是一個美國人，他不會明白中國人吃飯的藝術，三兩紹興酒，二聲哥兒倆好，常會獲得會議以外的妙用。</p>
<p>所以我那麽想：假使馬歇爾眞的來上一桌「團圓酒」，來兩瓶威士忌提提興，來幾個紹興酒潤潤嗓子，由馬歇爾擺下一個「統關」，各人用盡嗓子喊上幾聲「全家福」和「哥兒倆好」，然後再由邵力子或者王世杰與周恩來，來一次「搶三」，大家盡着嗓子的聲音有多大使多大，把一股悶氣借機出盡之後，馬歇爾到這時候——酒過三巡，如果再喊出一個「哥兒倆好」來，我相信大家一定不會再板着冷面孔說風凉話了。說不定眞個大家從此好起來，那末你我小百姓豈不是「全家有福」了！</p>
<p>最後，我的「想法」是馬歇爾亦該換換方式，會議時僅僅吃些「沙漏水」，不但不能提起興趣，反倒眞的變成「冷在心頭」了。</p>
<h3>飲者的話</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>朋友們都勸我戒酒。</p>
<p>他們都說：一個人儘在藥爐茶鐺裏討生活，却還去不了酒，這無異於在作慢性的自殺了。</p>
<p>自殺，我可沒有這種勇氣，要有的話，早在十多年前就自殺了，何待今日。酒能戕害生命，我非不知，然而酒跟我結綠已二十多個年頭了，却又不見得戕害了我的生命；反而，沒有了酒的時候，使人感到生之可悲；酒杯一拿到了手，人反而是飄飄然，見着滿眼都是生機，都是樂趣。即使是在感慨萬端，「舉杯消愁愁更愁」的時候吧，也會從酒杯裏見到了有意義的人生，並不比在未喝酒時所見到的人生只是一片灰色。</p>
<p>這多年來我發現酒給我不是一種如一般所謂的毒素，而却是一種純人生的刺戟；它能鼓舞我去做人，激勵我去作生之掙扎。從頹喪中援拔我出來，從冰冷裏送給我許多熱力，給我透視到人生是多樣的人生，世界又是一個多稜角而且　雜的世界。世界縮小來說是一個棋盤，國家和民族便是在兩棋盤上面爭逐的棋子，棋子的爭逐是被主宰着的，被主宰着就有勝負之分，生死存亡之別，然而在惺忪的醉眼着去可眞多稜角而　雜的啊！也唯有在惺忪的醉眼中使人理解到其中的眞理。我這多年來就得了酒的不少助力。</p>
<p>誰說酒會「戕害人生？」</p>
<p>但酒會使人冒險的，冒險到死都不怕。這大槪就是所謂「戕害人生吧！然而酒的本懷並不如此的啊！它祗要人見到了眼前的危險並不當是一個危險而已。所以，從這一方面的證明，它確可能帶你蹈過了危機，從危機中挽回你的生命。在我的見解是如此。</p>
<p>可是，酒有時帶給我一點懊惱，因爲它給我的勇氣太多了，便過於冒失；過於冒失就得後悔，然祇能在醒後才有的，如果仍然在醉昏昏的裏頭，這後悔也永不會成其爲後悔了。</p>
<p>酒給一個人對於他的人生沒有危險而不是冒險；此則酒之所以可愛。</p>
<p>我最初喝酒，總是守着「惟酒無量不及亂」的戒條的，熱上那末一斤半斤，喝成一副猪肝臉，就從解透人生的眞諦裏去陶陶然，便認爲滿足。後來，不是爲了酒量已滿，而是性子逐漸狂放了許多，就非一斤半斤所能過癮了。於是，從酒裏所嘗到的人生味便更深一層，有時，一個制止不住就得使酒駡座。</p>
<p>駡座的確是一件痛快的事呢！「酒後出眞言」，罵的人總有其可駡，而是不能不駡，才得會給我在「酒後」澈頭澈尾地駡個淋漓盡致。但，這總是我得罪人的地方，要是給駡的人不自反省的話。後來，關於這一點我受着朋友的勸吿戒除了許多，可是酒的飲量還是有增無已，這絕然不是量洪，而是自己要多喝。</p>
<p>要多喝就得醉了。醉了，才是眞正的人生。</p>
<p>然而，這對於紹酒是如此而已。及至轉移到了香港，就不敢一飲便是一斤了。爲的是雙蒸不比花雕，雙蒸入口便辣。</p>
<p>飲雙蒸有人象徵是「吞剃刀片」，但我總不承認它會「戕害人生」。</p>
<p>可是，雙蒸給飲，醉了非經過大半天不能醒轉過來的，而且醒後老是帶着一副死人臉孔。常常害病的我帶着這副死人臉孔便更來得嚇人。</p>
<p>因爲來得嚇人，朋友便常常勸我戒酒。</p>
<p>戒酒不難，但戒了酒之後，人生的趣味也要隨而消逝了，至少對於我，是這樣。</p>
<p>然而朋友的善意怎能够辜負呢，這個多月來，我便接受朋友的勸吿而實行戒酒。</p>
<p>戒了酒之後妻立刻展開了常蹙的眉頭，原因，在「貧賤夫妻百事哀」之中每日給她少張羅一筆酒費。</p>
<p>可我一切都感到空虛了，在這個多月來，戒了酒之後。</p>

<h3>玻璃兵艦</h3>
<p>— 鄒尚昌</p>
<p>馬路上鬧轟轟的，東一堆人，西一堆人，大家全在交頭接耳的談論着，聽說下午有美國的玻璃兵艦來滬。</p>
<p>雖然大熱的天，火毒的太陽高掛在天中，然而黃浦江邊却擠滿了人，爲的是來看美國的玻璃兵艦。人人都是耐心的等着，二三小時過去了。兵艦還是連影子也沒有，忽然有人大嚷「玻璃兵艦來了，玻璃兵艦來了」於是千萬只眼睛齊向江中望着，後面看不見的提起了脚根，伸長了項頸向江中看。只見江中一陣大風，吹得岸上的人睜不開眼，風浪大作，眞有排山倒海之勢，不久風平浪靜，烟消雲散，上海人又多了一種傳說。總算玻璃兵艦也來過了。</p>

<p>或謂打撲克要有忍耐精神，同時又須手辣心狠，可以欺騙時不妨欺騙，風聲不對時　寗效　縮，總之干變萬化，刻刻須防；所以涉世未深的人，雅不宜於入局，反之精於此道者，其人必已富有處世經騐。然而隨機應變，固爲處世必要條件。至於成敗利鈍，還是全憑命運，命運不濟，還是徒勞無功。</p>
<p>「嗜酒之人，不可與言秘密」，這句話未必可靠。最近受審的許多漢奸，在公堂上不是把「和中央通聲氣」的秘密，個個都洩漏出來了嗎？不相信這一批漢奸都是酒徒。</p>
<p>國父壽終於北平顧維鈞宅中，有鑲於墻壁上之陰文金字漢白玉石紀念脾，前爲守屋之某老人於日寇進佔前用白灰塗平，得仍保存完好。某老人今已不知何往。惜乎此事竟未爲褚民誼所知，否則亦可利用一下，向法院提出，作爲要求減罪的理由，豈不比之並無其事的「保存總理　　」，證據硬括多了。</p>
<p>家裏買不到米，一位同事說不確，米店裏有的是米，只是不肯賣罷了。但是下一天吾回去時，曾在附近各米舖中實地　查過，除了店夥們正在用膳放着一大鍋熟飯外，的的確確米桶裏看不到一粒米。這證明了同事說的是　話，而米商未我斯也</p>

<h3>At the Capital's Memorial Service for War Dead Military and Civilians: The Chairman's Address Most Encourages Fellow Countrymen to Build a New China with the Spirit of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The capital's all-circles memorial service for military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance was solemnly held at the National Assembly Hall Plaza at 9:00 this morning. Chairman Chiang himself presided over the sacrifice at 9:30. As the ceremony began, mournful music was played, flowers were offered, and after the memorial text was read, the Chairman stepped onto the stage to deliver a speech, saying, "Today is the ninth anniversary of the July 7th Incident, and also the first July 7th anniversary since our victory in the War of Resistance. Recalling this day nine years ago, our military and civilians across the country, under the leadership of the National Government, shed blood and sweat, sacrificed and struggled to resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism. After eight years of fierce battles and arduous struggles, we finally achieved the final victory and reached our goal of expelling the enemy and restoring our territory. Today, as we approach this great and glorious anniversary, our compatriots across the country should never forget the military and civilian martyrs who died in the past eight years. They sacrificed their lives and donated their property for the country, for the nation, and for the Three Principles of the People, laying the foundation for our victory in the War of Resistance. Today, as we mourn them, we must continue their legacy and complete their unfinished work. As you all know, our purpose in resisting the war was to build the nation. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the work of nation-building has not yet begun. In the future, our compatriots across the country must use the spirit of perseverance and fortitude from the early days of the War of Resistance, work together with one heart and one mind, and strive to implement the Three Principles of the People and build our Republic of China into a prosperous, strong, healthy and happy modern nation, able to survive permanently in the world with freedom, independence, and honor. Only in this way can we comfort the spirits of our Founding Father and the military and civilian martyrs in heaven, and only in this way can we fulfill the responsibilities that we, the survivors, should fulfill. Today, at the memorial service for the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, I would like to express this sentiment and encourage my compatriots across the country to work together." After the speech, the entire audience shouted the following slogans: (1) The spirit of the military and civilians who died will never die; (2) Complete the mission of nation-building; (3) Implement the Three Principles of the People; (4) Long live China; (5) Long live Chairman Chiang. The echoes resounded through the clouds, and the ceremony concluded with music at 10:00.</p>
<h3>The Memorial Service was Solemn and Solemn</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Today is the ninth anniversary of the War of Resistance, and also the first "July 7th" anniversary after the victory. The capital's all-circles especially held a memorial service for the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance at the National Assembly Hall Plaza at 9:00 a.m. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the ceremony, attended by about 20,000 people, including military police, various associations and groups, teachers and students from schools, representatives from various military and political organs, party members, group members, and the general public. The venue was decorated in a solemn and solemn manner, with the spirit tablet of the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance enshrined in the center of the altar. Chairman Chiang inscribed the four characters "Loyalty and Righteousness for Thousands of Autumns," which were hung above it. On both sides were wreaths and elegiac couplets from central leaders and various circles. The Central Executive and Supervisory Committees elegized, "Righteousness pierces the sky, millions of heroic spirits died for the country, the triumphant return soars across the sea, eight years of hard work lay the foundation for the nation." At 9:00 a.m., more than 20,000 people participating in the conference had formed neat rows. The Chairman then arrived, and the ceremony began. The entire audience stood in silence, and the Chairman took his seat. While the mourning music was played, he bowed his head and meditated in a solemn and dignified manner. Civil and military officials stood on both sides, including Central Committee members Ding Weifen, Zhang Ji, Chen Guofu, Feng Yuxiang, Dean Dai Fuxian, Zhou Zhongyue, Weng Wenhui, Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Song Ziwen, and Shao Lizi. After the flower offering, the memorial text was respectfully read, and the entire audience bowed three times to the spirit tablets of the military and civilians who died, and observed a moment of silence in mourning. Then, the Chairman delivered a speech (see previous telegram), and the entire audience listened respectfully to the Chairman's instructions, which were extremely inspiring. After the ceremony, people from all walks of life freely offered sacrifices in an endless stream. Today, the entire city flew flags at half-mast and suspended entertainment for one day. At noon, an air raid alarm was sounded, and citizens stood at attention in place, silently mourning for one minute. Various Christian churches held prayer services for the country, and the War of Resistance book exhibition organized by the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, including the War of Resistance history books by the Liang Youming and Liang Zhongming brothers, as well as more than 800 War of Resistance photos from the Central News Agency and Zhengqiu Publishing House, opened for three days starting today.

<h3>The Bangkok Chinese Chamber of Commerce Sends a Special Telegram to the Chairman to Pay Respects</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 7th] On the July 7th anniversary, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce here sent a special telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay respects and express condolences to the families of the fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Memorial Text to the Military and Civilians Who Died in the War</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Chairman Chiang's memorial text to the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance is as follows: On July 7th, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, respectfully offers incense, flowers, and clear wine to the spirits in heaven of the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, saying: The Lugou Bridge incident was the serious opening, leading soldiers to share the same hatred. Pitying soldiers in a righteous battle is the path to victory. Accumulating centuries of shame, we hope to wash it away together. Stirred by righteous anger, the military and civilians became one. Going through fire and water, we must fight for every inch of land. Our spirit forms fortresses, and our flesh and blood form walls. The flames of the enemy were rampant, and the disparity in strength was great. We were never expected to contain voracious boars and long snakes. The vast Central Plains were filled with haze, and fertile land and famous cities became dens of bandits. We fought one battle after another, with those in the front falling and those in the rear rising. Cutting open our intestines and severing our throats, we pitied our blue blood and green compassion. We pushed back thousands of men, and crushed tens of thousands of cavalry. We charged and fought ten times, seizing flags and planting our own. We galloped south and north, across rivers and mountains. The mountains were strange and lured the enemy, with mountains so short that they appeared as dragons. When silent, we hid our swords, and when moving, we were as sharp as an awl. Weak rain and smoke cleared, and the light of swords flashed. All of our comrades, in their battle gowns, valued death more than tying their helmets' straps. One sleep lasts for eternity, and their imposing spirit still lives on. Hermits inspired their ideals, like a gentle breeze. Wang Qi wielded his spear, even at a young age. Pure women maintained their chastity, as pure as white snow. They refused to be defiled by righteousness, and fulfilled their great integrity. Their integrity was multifaceted, and their difficulties were manifold. The Kunlun Mountains were ablaze, and jade and stone were broken together. They sought peace of mind with their inherent goodness. They exchanged life for death, so how could we call it a hundred difficulties? Changshan had a tongue, and Suiyang had teeth. One heart and one mind, antiquity had never seen this. Those who gain the Way receive much help, and the soldiers unite in alliance. We accepted the surrender overseas, and captured the capital from the bandits. The jade candle has been re-adjusted, and the golden goblet is without flaw. We will forever remember the merits of the revival of the nation with the spirits of the former martyrs. Soldiers rest at Zhongling, and the stone city is tall and strong. I report to the nine netherworlds, using cloth to express my grief. I will lie down and remember Du Yu, and beat the drum and think of Zai Jiang. Transforming into a thousand million bodies, may you be your son’s advisor. With yellow bananas and red lychees, I offer clear wine. If your spirit is not dim, please acknowledge this sincerity. Alas! I hope...</p>
<h3>The Whole Country Commemorates July 7th</h3>

<h3>American Newspaper Discusses the Anti-American Demonstration in Shanghai: Should be Blamed on the Communist Party; Most Chinese Still Regard the United States as a Friend</h3>

<h3>The Communist Party Insists on the Original Proposal for the Issue of Troop Stationing, Only Allowing Withdrawal from Harbin</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] According to a source from the Communist Party: The results of the three talks of the Five-Person Meeting have been reported to the headquarters of the Communist Party, but there is no response yet. As for the issue of troop stationing, the Communist Party has no new opinions on the withdrawal of troops from northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Rehe, and insists on the original conditions. The only place that the Communist Party can withdraw from is Harbin, and it only allows the government to send 5,000 security troops to be stationed there. Local administration will be organized by people's elections and form a coalition government, but this is only the opinion of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Five-Person Meeting of the government and Communist Party representatives is taking a break today. It is heard that due to the Communist Party's unwillingness to withdraw from northern Jiangsu and its objections to withdrawing from Rehe and Jiaodong, the issue of the administrative power of the Communist Army's stationed areas and the Communist Army's occupied areas has not achieved significant results. The government representatives have now reported the progress of the talks to Chairman Chiang through Shao Lizi. News tonight is that the Five-Person Meeting is still planning to continue, and it is said that it will still be held at Chen Cheng's residence or Shao Lizi's residence on Langya Road at 9:00 tomorrow morning, but the notice has not yet been issued as of midnight tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] According to qualified observers, although what is being discussed at the Five-Person Meeting is a local political issue related to military affairs, if it proceeds smoothly, it will be of great benefit to the negotiation of other issues. At present, due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity, the progress of the talks is slow, resulting in dull news. The people of the country are mostly anxious and hope that the Communist Party will quickly negotiate with the government in good faith, and it is best to implement some possible solutions, such as the withdrawal of the Communist Army from Harbin City, Rehe, and northern Jiangsu, without further delay, so that the people can alleviate their suffering, which is also beneficial to the Communist Party, because any political party that sings highly of democracy can never ignore the suffering of the people for long and act recklessly by harming the people.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] According to extremely well-informed sources, today's report to the United Press reporter that General Chen Cheng had stated that most of the main issues of troop reduction had been resolved yesterday is not true.

<h3>Japanese Encephalitis Discovered in Tianjin, US Military Takes Preventive Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 7th] US Navy medical officers announced today that deadly Japanese encephalitis has been discovered among US troops in Tianjin. Four people have died from the disease today, and 28 more are being treated in the hospital. There is little research on this disease in medicine, but it is known to be virulent and have a high mortality rate. There is no specific medicine available for treatment. The disease affects the brain and is a type of sleeping sickness. At least two people died within five hours of developing a fever and headache. US military medical authorities first discovered the disease after entering Okinawa in May and June last year, but the epidemic was not as severe as this one. The US side airlifted a type of serum yesterday for injection. US military authorities here have also taken various preventive measures. US military personnel are generally not allowed to go out at night, movies and other gatherings have been suspended, all soldiers have been issued mosquito nets, and DDT pesticide has been thoroughly sprayed. According to military doctors, the disease is caused by mosquito bites, or possibly by human contact.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Why is China Subjected to Such Humiliation?</h3>
<p>Yesterday, our fellow countrymen, amidst the painful memories of the "July 7th" War of Resistance Memorial, felt an indescribable humiliation in our international standing! And this unexpected humiliation came from our ally – the Soviet Union – with whom we have strived for amity for eighty-nine years, truly making the 450 million people of China feel extremely surprised!</p>
<p>The matter is as follows: The Foreign Ministers' Conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union decided to convene a twenty-one-nation peace conference on July 29th to discuss draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suddenly insisted that China should not be invited as a convening nation of the peace conference. United States Secretary of State Byrnes immediately refuted this, considering that this act was tantamount to insulting China. British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed several suggestions to establish an agreement on the method of invitation, but all were blocked by Molotov. Finally, the Soviet opinion was accepted, with only the four powers – the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union – acting as inviting nations. Later, due to unresolved discussions on the conference procedures, invitations have not yet been sent. Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued an important statement the day before yesterday, advocating that the Paris Peace Conference should be convened by all members of the "Foreign Ministers' Council," otherwise, the Chinese government would consider it a violation of the Moscow Agreement. Regarding this matter, we believe that Byrnes's statement that it is "tantamount to insulting China" is not an exaggeration. Whether the Soviet Union intended it or not, it will somewhat affect the Chinese people's feelings of friendship towards the Soviet Union over the years. This is very regrettable.</p>
<p>How to convene the twenty-one-nation peace conference to discuss the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and which country should invite the participating nations, originally seemed like not a significant issue. But why do we attach so much importance to it? This is a matter of etiquette in the international arena, and also a matter of the effectiveness of resolutions passed at international conferences. If everyone speaks of trust and amity, yet can deliberately disregard allies, and if everyone solemnly agrees to a meeting, yet can erase resolutions, how can there be a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere in the international community in the future? According to the announcement of the Potsdam Conference by the three great powers – the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union – on August 2, 1945, the "Foreign Ministers' Council" was to be formed by the five nations of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, responsible for discussing and concluding peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and proposing solutions to territorial issues that became common outstanding matters after the European war. Furthermore, according to the Moscow Agreement of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the three nations – the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union – on December 24 of the same year, this peace treaty should be drafted by the representatives of the four foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and the peace conference to discuss this draft peace treaty should be convened by the "Foreign Ministers' Council" consisting of the five nations of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. According to the announcements of these two international conferences, China should undoubtedly be one of the inviting nations for the twenty-one-nation peace conference. Why did the Soviet Foreign Minister insist on changing the content of the invitation to "The French government, in accordance with the decision of the Foreign Ministers' Council on July 4th, has the honor to invite (so and so) to attend the peace conference on behalf of the Four Foreign Ministers' Council," deliberately excluding China from the convening nations of the peace conference? This is not only an insult to the status of China, which fought alongside them during World War II, but also the beginning of arbitrarily abandoning existing international agreements. "Treading on frost leads to hard ice," which is indeed worth our vigilance!</p>
<p>Although China, in this World War, due to geographical constraints, could not directly participate in the European theater and fight against Nazi Germany and its vassals, it consistently held back more than a million of the Japanese enemy's troops, causing them to be mired in China and unable to provide effective assistance to Germany and Italy, which cannot but be said to be China's contribution. Especially for the Soviet Union, during the German-Soviet war, the reason it did not have to face enemies on two fronts and Japan consistently maintained a delicate friendly relationship with the Soviet Union, one cannot fail to recognize that this was due to China's efforts in resisting Japan. Moreover, looking back, throughout the entire course of this war, China was at the forefront of anti-aggression, the vanguard of safeguarding world peace, which cannot be denied by any country. The United Kingdom and the United States, which fought alongside China in the Far East, naturally understand China's heavy burden in the war, and even the Soviet Union knows in its heart that China's resistance against Japan in the Far East is equivalent to the Soviet Union's resistance against Germany in Europe, and is in no way inferior. But why does Molotov despise China so much today? Any Chinese person with a bit of conscience, if their innate goodness has not been extinguished, should deeply reflect!</p>
<p>Let us further examine our country's diplomacy during and after the war. In any international conference, we have consistently adopted an impartial and detached attitude. When there are irreconcilable disputes, we often act as mediators, resolving difficulties, hoping that the international community can "unite" rather than "divide." Even between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, we always try to be their bridge, facilitating communication and cooperation, preventing them from going their separate ways. The reason why our country does this is not only because we value friendship with the Soviet Union, but also because we deeply feel the importance of creating world peace and dare not take it lightly. Moreover, in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, China even seeks the permanent consolidation of Sino-Soviet amity with a great spirit of self-sacrifice. We truly do not know why the Soviet Foreign Minister wants to insult China's international status to such an extent!</p>
<p>We remember a prominent figure in the Soviet Communist Party once said: "The Soviet Union must strengthen itself, then it can avoid being humiliated by others." Conversely, Molotov's humiliation of China this time is meant to give us Chinese people a shocking new lesson, which is tantamount to saying that China is a weak country and not a strong country. If China were truly as strong as the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Molotov would definitely not deliberately make us uncomfortable. Because of this, it is no wonder that the United States, wishing to see China become a strong, unified, and democratic China, is striving to provide military aid to China, assisting us in reorganizing and training our troops, while the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists are increasingly opposed to American aid to China, advocating that American troops withdraw from China. We firmly demand that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must argue reasonably, ensuring that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union abide by the Potsdam Declaration and the Moscow Agreement, and respect China's status as an inviting nation to the peace conference. At the same time, we must awaken our compatriots to recognize the true nature of the international situation, distinguish the true value of allied friendship, and work together towards the goal of "Nation First, People First," strengthening ourselves and washing away external humiliation!</p>

<h3>Letter of Correction</h3>
<p>I recently read the "Suzhou Quick Report: Qin Lianggong Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat" news item in the "Local Dispatches" section of your newspaper on the 4th of this month, which caused me great surprise. After investigation, Qin Nigong Lianggong had previously been sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment with parole by the Jiangsu High Court. Due to overcrowding in the High Court detention center, it was approved to transfer the first-instance judgment of the Han traitor to our prison for detention as a means of relief. The said traitor was transferred to our prison for detention on May 14th of this year. On July 3rd, we received the Jiang Su High Court Prosecutor's Office, Su Jian Zi No. 6889, instruction to send the written order of execution and other documents, and we will comply with the order to carry out the sentence. After investigation, said traitor Qin Lianggong has not engaged in any illegal activities since entering the prison. The suicide news reported by your newspaper is likely based on mistaken rumors. This matter concerns the reputation of our prison. I am writing to inform you accordingly, hoping you will investigate and make a correction. Thank you!</p>

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Hold Lengthy Discussions; No Agreement Reached on Conference Procedures; Soviet Representative Again Obstructs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, July 7th Broadcast: At the beginning of this week, the future of the Peace Conference is still uncertain. British Undersecretary of State Jebb proposed inviting Egypt and Austria to attend the Peace Conference. Egypt has a close relationship with the disposal of North African Italian colonies, and Italy will have the right to express its opinions. The three undersecretaries of state have agreed to consider Jebb's proposal.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, July 6th Electric] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference continued today to discuss the principles and procedures that should be followed at the Peace Conference on the 29th of this month. After four hours, no agreement was reached. The agenda proposed by the chairman, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, included three items: (1) Rules of procedure for the Peace Conference, (2) Reparations issues, (3) German issues. The first item alone took four hours. According to the above three items, the first and second items were drafted by the French delegation in April of this year, while the third item was recently proposed by the Soviet delegation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, July 6th Electric] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers continued to meet this afternoon to discuss the question of which country should be the inviting country for the 21-nation Peace Conference. The issue was discussed for several hours yesterday, without result, due to the inability to agree on whether China should be a convener of the Peace Conference together with the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. Under protest, Byrnes and Bevin had once accepted Molotov's request to agree that only the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France should be the conveners, but the Peace Conference invitations must be issued immediately and must not contain any insult to China. Unexpectedly, Molotov again obstructed, resolutely insisting that the Peace Conference procedural law must be drafted before the invitations are issued. Regarding this point, the other foreign ministers expressed that they could not accept it, so the determination of the convening countries of the Peace Conference and the drafting of procedural laws will continue to be discussed this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, July 7th Electric] According to private predictions by diplomatic authorities here: Although the Four Foreign Ministers Conference has made progress on the work of the draft peace treaty, the Soviet Union will still try to prolong the period to keep its troops stationed in Eastern Europe. Otherwise, there will be a major change in Soviet foreign policy, and the tension between the great powers will also be greatly eased. The early withdrawal of occupying troops stationed in Europe is one of the goals of United States Secretary of State Byrnes. According to news received here, the issue of occupying troops has gradually become concrete. Byrnes advocates that the powers establish an agreement stipulating that troops should be withdrawn approximately three months after the signing of the peace treaty. Molotov, on the other hand, proposes that the date of withdrawal be decided on the date of ratification of the peace treaty. However, the period from the signing of the peace treaty to its ratification can take months or even years. If Molotov's proposal is accepted, then Soviet troops can remain stationed for a long time, which is contrary to the United States' intention to restore peace as soon as possible. There are at least 1.53 million Soviet troops stationed in Europe. There are approximately 600,000 Soviet troops in Germany, 350,000 in Poland, over 150,000 in Austria, and approximately 530,000 in the Balkans. As for Soviet military operations in Yugoslavia and Albania, they are even the subject of various rumors, but there are no official reports to date.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, July 7th Electric] Approximately 20,000 Italian citizens held a group demonstration in the People's Square here last night, protesting the Four Foreign Ministers Conference's decisions unfavorable to Italy. This demonstration has an anti-United Nations nature. When Fivola, chairman of the Italian War Veterans Association, gave a speech, the crowds responded with cries of "Down with England" and "Down with France." Fivola said, "France does not have an individual dictator like our Mussolini, but we have recently suffered from French slander and the entire French people should be held responsible." When Fivola referred to France as our "Latin sister country," his voice was interrupted by the crowd's shouts and boos, who yelled, "Shitty sister is not a Latin sister." Afterwards, the crowds marched in the streets, and when passing by buildings requisitioned by the French military authorities, the demonstrators showed contempt for the French flag and spat on it.</p>

<h3>Anglo-Soviet Relations Improve; Soviet Press Focuses Attacks on the U.S.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 6th] Moscow observers feel that the international outlook today is better than it has been for months. Moscow diplomats believe the outcome of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference has definitely improved the political atmosphere. Although observers believe this is a temporary phenomenon, with many difficulties remaining unsolved, any reduction in anxiety is still a partial victory. The Soviet people feel the success of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is due to the concessions and suggestions of the Soviet delegation. Recently, the target of attacks in the Soviet newspapers seems to have shifted from Britain to the United States, with the atomic bomb, Pan-Americanism, attempts to establish bases worldwide, and interference in China all being targeted. The future of Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations appears brighter, with the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan requiring various machines, which can be acquired from Britain in exchange for its surplus timber.</p>

<h3>The Inside and Out of British Politics</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xueyan, June 15th Airmail</p>
<p>Recently, British newspapers have rarely published news about China. It is said that one of the reasons is that after the Chinese government returned to Nanjing, the telecommunications between London and Nanjing/Shanghai have not yet returned to normal. Many important news items, when inquired about by the Chinese agencies in London, were often directly denied because they could not be verified. By the time they were confirmed, they had lost their news value.</p>
<p>General Public Opinion on China</p>
<p>Here's an example: regarding the partial reorganization of the Executive Yuan, only "The Times" published it, but the evidence was obviously not solid. Some time later, "The Observer" also mentioned it briefly, but other newspapers did not mention it at all. Also, only "The Times" reported on the National Army's entry into Changchun, while other newspapers did not publish it. However, although these news items were reported sparingly, they did not escape the attention of those concerned about Chinese affairs. The day after "The Times" published the news of the National Army entering Changchun and advancing towards Harbin (May 29th), it published a commentary stating that the prestige of the Central Government had been enhanced as a result, and that a compromise could be expected to be reached. It also said that although the true reason for not including the Three Eastern Provinces in the truce agreement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was unknown, it may have been because the Central Government trusted the Sino-Soviet Treaty and believed that the recovery of the Three Eastern Provinces was not a problem based on legal rights; while the Communist Party was confident in its local strength, so it refused the entry of the Central Army and issued provocative remarks. But now the facts prove that resorting to force is not necessarily a one-sided privilege. Now the Communist Party is enthusiastic about the truce issue and has abandoned provocative remarks, while the Central Government has also stated that it is willing to resolve the Northeast issue peacefully. It is hoped that General Marshall's efforts to mediate will not be in vain.</p>
<p>Currently, British newspapers' opinions on China are very inconsistent, perhaps reflecting the uncertainty of the British people's attitude and policy towards China. In the several international conferences since the surrender of Germany and Japan, the trend of maintaining a balance of power and power diplomacy has become increasingly prevalent. Britain has enormous rights in the Far East. What will the relationship between China and Britain be in the future under the circumstances of great powers confronting each other? It is difficult to predict. If China is united and strong, Britain's relationship with China will naturally improve, and many problems will be easier to solve. If China remains divided and chaotic, just like before the war, and becomes prey for the great powers, then Britain, in the scramble for power and profit, has always been at the forefront and will never lag behind. Around the time of Japan's surrender, the British government and public seemed to expect that China might be an emerging nation in the world, so its policy towards China seemed to be willing to establish a new relationship on a certain degree of concession. But soon it saw China in a crisis of division, followed by endless disputes over the Three Eastern Provinces, and in the coastal areas, the newly recovered territories were in chaotic order, and the receiving personnel once again displayed ugly behavior. British public opinion then changed again. Although the newspapers often carried news about China, they were always contemptuous. The implication was that now that the war was over, China was once again embarking on the old path of division and corruption. Now that Changchun has been recovered, if peaceful unification succeeds, British public opinion can be expected to change again. In the diplomatic application after the war, it should not be a problem for Britain to find a Far Eastern country to establish a friendly cooperative relationship. Currently, the most likely one is naturally China. The so-called "China is the stabilizing force in the Far East" is of course attracting everyone's attention. But if China does not revitalize itself, and Japan's order is quickly restored, then at least Britain's attention can still be shifted to Japan.</p>
<p>The Golden Age of the Labour Party</p>
<p>Although former British Prime Minister Churchill is now out of office, his respect among the people seems to be growing stronger over time. Wherever he goes, he receives a warm welcome from the public, and his speeches and actions are often published in prominent positions in newspapers. Today in Edinburgh, the citizens gave him a new title; tomorrow in Manchester, the people gave him another new title. The people are very generous in bestowing on him all possible human honors. But strangely enough, despite enjoying such great fame and honor, the party he leads cannot win in elections, and its strength in local council re-elections is declining. Therefore, the most resounding slogan in the Conservative Party's advertisements for young party members is simply to ask them to look to the future. In fact, if we pay attention to the policies of the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, we will know that the Conservative Party's failure is not accidental. The characteristic of the Labour Party's policy is the nationalization of large enterprises, seeking the greatest welfare for the middle and lower classes of society. It goes without saying that major mineral products, heavy industrial factories, and railway companies will all be acquired by the state; even some professions related to public welfare, such as medical services, will also be run by the state. For a few owners, it is true that they have lost their family inheritance for generations; but for general consumers and hard-working workers, nationalization is much more reasonable after all. The Conservative Party does not have a clear policy to counter this. It only knows how to make things difficult for the government everywhere. Whenever the government wants to implement a plan, the Conservative Party always opposes it in Parliament. The policy of the opposition party seems to have only one opposition policy. Now, because of the disparity in numbers and the unequal strength of the two sides, opposition cannot succeed, so it can only adopt delaying tactics at most, delaying the implementation of government policies as much as possible. The general public has a rather negative impression of it. Therefore, even with Churchill's achievements and fame, it cannot save the Conservative Party's decline. The British people today, on the one hand, spare no effort to bestow various honors on Churchill, and on the other hand, do not allow his party to rule. This is not a contradiction, but because the people's level of political knowledge is very high. They distinguish between rewarding virtue and making use of it, and do not confuse the two. Churchill made great contributions to the country in the past, so the people added honors to show that they are not ungrateful. But his party's policies are useless today, so they do not harm the government because of a person. Only when the people's level of knowledge reaches this level can politics be clear and progressive.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Labour Party is now in its golden age. Every bill proposed by the government can be passed in Parliament. Even if there are occasional vacancies due to the death of old members, most of those elected in by-elections are Labour Party members. But whether such good times can last is another question. The Labour Party is in its golden age, and many policies advocated by the Labour Party have also been implemented. It is naturally impossible for the people to think that this is ideal and that no further progress should be sought. For example, the nationalization policy is originally a gradual form of socialism. The purpose is to transfer private enterprises to public ownership, but compensation is still given to the old owners. But the problem lies here. Many young and radical people have expressed dissatisfaction with this, advocating unconditional nationalization. At the very least, the value of compensation should not be set so high, which would only allow those with good fathers and mothers to sit back and eat. Especially like railway companies, because they lost money during the war, the government plans to buy them. It must first raise the price of tickets to pay off the old debts before setting a price for acquisition. It makes people feel that the rich are risk-free, and the losses are only shared by the public. They can steadily climb into their old capital. Today, those who have this kind of thinking are naturally still a minority, but among young people, some have already said that if the Conservative Party can cooperate with the Communist Party, it can win the next election. At present, this is of course a joke, but in the future, those who can overthrow the Labour Party government must have policies that are more progressive and more active than the Labour Party, which is quite accurate.</p>
<p>The Food Minister's Sorrow</p>
<p>Currently, there is a global famine, and food is scarce everywhere. Britain is a small island nation with a large population. Two-thirds of its food needs to be shipped from overseas, so it naturally feels even more difficult. Former Food Minister Smith happened to be in this position and was faced with this difficult situation, and he felt that his efforts were not appreciated. Since last winter, the grievances of the people who were dissatisfied with the current diet have all been directed at him alone. The newspapers of the opposition party even identified him as a good target for attacking the government and opened fire on him. In addition, there was a severe food shortage in the British occupied zone in Germany, and the amount of distribution was far from comparable to the American and Soviet military zones. He was forced to go to the United States to discuss the matter, but the result seemed to be unsuccessful. He could only further reduce the allocation of bread and fat in Britain to help Germany in an emergency. But this also aroused the resentment of the British people, so speculation that he was uneasy in his position had already spread. However, on the one hand, three important ministers of the cabinet were in India, Bevin was busy attending the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, and Morrison also had a trip to the United States. Only the Prime Minister was in charge in the cabinet, so the announcement of the change of ministers was slightly delayed, at least waiting for Bevin and Morrison to return home. Secondly, the difficulty of British food is not just a matter of personal talent. Without external assistance, a clever woman cannot cook without rice. Even if Smith stepped down, it would be difficult for others to succeed him. Until recently, Morrison returned from the United States and had a solution to the food problem. The aid to the occupied zone in Germany no longer needs to rely on the rationing of the British people, so it was time to announce the change of food minister (May 27th). Smith's parting words were that he regretted that he could not improve the people's menu during his tenure and hoped that his successor would not be as unfortunate as he was. The new Food Minister is Strachey, who was originally the Undersecretary of the Air Force and has always been regarded as a promising talent among rising stars. In his first reception of reporters after taking office, he said that he would strive to improve the menu so that it would not be as monotonous as it is now and hoped to purchase and sell fruits.</p>
<p>The Subtle Relationship Between Britain and Spain</p>
<p>The Franco regime has become an object of curses today. Many countries want to take advantage of the newly won power of democracy to overthrow him in one fell swoop and eliminate the remnants of this fascist inferior species. But when this issue was truly brought to the Security Council of the United Nations, and action was proposed, although no one openly opposed it, implementation was unexpectedly difficult. To understand the key to this, the problem lies again with Britain. In August of last year, after the Potsdam Conference ended, the three powers' resolution condemning the Franco regime was announced, and the British Labour Cabinet was also newly formed. Foreign Secretary Bevin explained the new cabinet's foreign policy in the House of Commons, and when he mentioned the Franco regime, he said that he had no goodwill towards the Franco regime and hoped that the Spanish people would automatically rise up and correct this mistake. But at the same time, he also stated that Britain was unwilling to participate in the use of external force to interfere in Spain's internal affairs, because once there was external interference, it would provoke the national emotions of the Spanish people and unanimously support Franco, and the Franco regime might become even more consolidated as a result. This theory has always been prevailing in the Security Council. No one sympathizes with Franco, but any proposal that can truly shake the Franco regime has the risk of arousing Spanish national emotions, which is also the risk of obtaining the opposite result, so they are all opposed. The implication is that the Security Council can only help Franco, and the Franco regime has a chance to diminish. Britain and Australia sang, the United States echoed, and many other countries followed. The Franco regime was thus preserved and stabilized under this subtle argument. Everyone knows this trick, but the question is why Britain wants to protect Franco? Politically speaking, maintaining the balance of power in Europe is of course the main reason. Regardless of whether Nazism can be revived in the future, there is no immediate danger of it rising again in the short term. On the contrary, the opposition between Eastern and Western democracies is very sharp. There are already too many countries in Europe that are close to the Soviet Union. Franco, regardless of his past, is still a mainstay in the midst of the left-leaning transformation of many countries. Why should he be overthrown? After Germany and Italy were defeated, Spain's foreign trade has all shifted to the hands of Britain and the United States. As far as Britain is concerned, in the spring of 1938, the spring of the last year before the war, Britain's total foreign trade was valued at over 208.5 million pounds, of which trade with Spain accounted for over 2.4 million pounds. This year, in the same quarter, Britain's total foreign trade was over 203.2 million pounds, and the total amount still cannot catch up with the pre-war level, which is naturally because many factories have not fully recovered to their original state; but trade with Spain has more than doubled compared to that year, amounting to over 5.9 million pounds, and there is still hope for an increase in the future. Considering this deal, Britain also hopes that Spain's internal stability will not change again. It is no wonder that the French trade union is asking the government to block the French-Spanish border, while at the same time studying countermeasures on how to maintain France's trade with Spain, so that it will not be entirely taken away by Britain due to the border blockade. Franco is of course also very aware of this subtle relationship and is trying to use the opportunity to change British public opinion. It is said that he spent a lot of money on public relations in London, creating luxurious clubs and the like to celebrate with the British government and public, and hired Professor Baxter, a Spanish professor at the University of London, to preside over the design. It is believed that there will be some results in the future.</p>

<h3>The Mournful Wind and Rain Commemorate the Fallen: More Than Two Thousand People from All Walks of Life Participate in the Memorial Service for Martyrs and Civilians. General He Yingqin Attends and Delivers a Speech. The Assembly Presents Souvenirs to the Families of the Deceased and the Allied Forces Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday was the first July 7th Memorial Day after the victory. At 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life in the city held a memorial service for the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance at the Tianchan Theater. Those who attended included Chairman Wu Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Wu Shaoshu, Zhou Xuexiang, Qian Jianqiu, and other representatives from all walks of life, totaling more than two thousand people. General He Yingqin, head of the military delegation that is about to go to the United States, also attended the event. The venue was decorated solemnly and solemnly, with elegiac couplets and eulogies hanging all over the walls. The horizontal area of the spiritual platform was inscribed with "Eternal Glory of China", with the "Killing to Become Benevolent and Righteousness Survives for All Time, Vowing to Serve the Country with Great Righteousness for Thousands of Autumns" from the Association of Martyrs' Comrades and other elegiac couplets on both sides. The memorial tablet was painted with red silk, and the portrait of the Premier was hung in front. The red silk was bright, and the stage was full of wreaths. Around the flower building were hung</p>
<p>More than 30 portraits of martyrs who died in this city, and the scene was tragic. At half past nine, mourning music was played, and after the ceremony, the whole hall was silent for three minutes. Then, wreaths were presented, the assembly read the eulogy (see below), and presented souvenirs to the families of the martyrs.</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Guozhen delivered a speech, briefly saying: Today, we mourn the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, and we have mixed feelings. Looking back to the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Battle of Shanghai made the international community recognize the bravery of our military and civilians. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, soldiers sacrificed their flesh and blood, and the people endured hardships and hardships, and were displaced. Finally, relying on consistent efforts and the assistance of the Allied nations, we achieved the final victory. Now, the future of nation-building is still in a difficult stage, and I hope that the people will continue to work hard with the spirit of struggle they had before. After the mayor's speech, the presidium read a telegram of thanks to US President Truman and reported on the presentation of souvenirs such as signed booklets of the US military in Shanghai. Finally, He Yingqin delivered a speech. Mr. He wore a military uniform, with the rank of general and a chest full of medals. At the beginning of his speech, he said: Today, to commemorate July 7th, we should pay tribute to the supreme leader and express our gratitude to the spirit of the Father of the Nation and the military and civilians who died in the war. Then, he put forward six points of thought: Our country has been weak for a hundred years, which has led to the enemy's invasion. The reason for this lies in the general people's lack of the concept of a national state. After eight years of the War of Resistance, we should have a deep awareness of this. The final victory of the War of Resistance was due to the wise leadership of the leader and the concentration of the people's will, so we should strengthen unity and consolidate unity in the future. In the eight years of the War of Resistance, there were 22 major battles, 1,117 important battles, and 38,931 minor battles. More than 1.31 million officers and soldiers were killed in battle, and more than 1.8 million were missing. The number of civilians who died is even countless. This great sacrifice is enough to show that the victory was extremely difficult to obtain, so we must work harder to ensure victory and not miss the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build the country. The enemy Japan also suffered extremely heavy casualties and losses. This is certainly the aggressor's own retribution, and it is also enough to teach the world that countries and people must treat each other with sincerity and morality. Our country's science is backward, and there is a lack of talent, which affects all work in a non-trivial way, so we must promote the development of science and heavy industry in the future. The Allied nations, especially the United States, provided the most assistance to our country during the War of Resistance. Today, to commemorate July 7th, we should express our deep gratitude. He also reported on the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and the receipt of weapons after the victory, with a total of more than 1.25 million prisoners, more than 780,000 enemy nationals (excluding the Northeast), more than 680,000 rifles, more than 29,000 machine guns, more than 12,400 artillery pieces, 383 tanks, 5 armored vehicles, more than 15,700 trucks, more than 74,000 horses, 1,068 aircraft, and 1,400 ships. Finally, He also emphasized that all our people should take the interests of the nation and the country as the premise to promote unity and to achieve the goal of nation-building. After the speech, music was played and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Eulogy of the Assembly</p>
<p>"On July 7th, the 35th year of the Republic of China, Wu Guozhen, Chairman of the Memorial Service for the Military and Civilians Who Died in the War of Resistance from all walks of life in Shanghai, and representatives from all walks of life, respectfully offer clear wine and humble offerings to the spirits of the military and civilian martyrs, saying: In the vast land of China, originating from Kunlun, the Chinese people have worked hard and exhausted their intelligence and ability, opening up territories and expanding the land, with fields and ridges crisscrossing, rivers and mountains forming belts, abundant cultural relics, and a flourishing nation; In modern times, the country is weak and the people are poor, and the tigers and wolves are coveting, launching an invasion, entering our empty house and occupying our cities; Killing our compatriots and hindering our survival. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, it was even more difficult. The brave soldiers fell forward and followed each other, the people of insight and benevolence rose up, their blood was red and bright, and they promoted righteousness. With sincerity, they completed the victory and should build the country in accordance with the principles. We only tell the heroic souls, and we hope that they will be relieved. The fragrance of pepper wine will be enjoyed forever. May you accept our offering."</p>
<p>Souvenirs Presented</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Assembly of All Circles to Commemorate the Military and Civilians Who Died in the War of Resistance resolved to promote Xu Jiqing of the Municipal Council, Du Yuesheng of the Local Association, Feng You of the Journalists Association, Liu Deming of the Army Friends Society, and other fourteen units. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, accompanied by Secretary-General He De Kui of the Municipal Government, they went to the residence of General Gillen, Commander of the US Army in China, on Taraco Road to present Mongolian border commemorative items. These commemorative items were distributed to Lieutenant General Gillen, Rear Admiral Kirk of the US Navy, and Colonel MacLennonorls of the US Air Force. In addition to five exquisite brochures signed by representatives of various groups, each of the three also received a silk-embroidered mirror frame. The army's frame was a lion. The navy's was a tiger. The air force's was embroidered with a falcon. Yesterday, after the representatives of various circles arrived at the residence of General Gillen, they were received by General Gillen, Rear Admiral Di Shabaenis of the Navy, and Colonel Luke of the Air Force, who shook hands with each representative to express their gratitude. After taking their seats, Wang Xiaolai read the eulogy at the beginning of the brochure on behalf of the group. After inquiring, Qian Jianqiu presented souvenirs on behalf of the group. Then, General Gillen and others gave their respective thank-you speeches. Finally, General Gillen and others took a group photo with the representatives as a memento.</p>

<h3>City Party Headquarters and Six Other Units Commemorate Martyred Comrades, Relatives' Representatives Present Four Hopes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters and six other organizations jointly hosted a memorial service for the Shanghai anti-Japanese war martyrs. The service was held at the Youth Hall yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, with over two hundred family members of the deceased comrades and martyrs, as well as representatives from various organizations and guests, in attendance. A banner with Chairman's inscription reading "Heroic Spirit Lives Forever" was hung in the center of the venue. The surroundings were filled with elegiac couplets and wreaths, along with over a hundred portraits of the martyrs. Above the altar were the memorial tablets for one hundred and fifteen martyrs, including Guo Dawei, Ping Zuren, and Du Gang. The meeting started punctually with the performance of ceremonial rites, followed by the reading of a eulogy by the chief celebrant, Li Shizeng. The eulogy read: "On this seventh day of July in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, the China Seamen's Special Party Headquarters, the Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the Shanghai Association of Comrades Who Perished During the Anti-Japanese War, respectfully offer incense and libations to the spirits of all the martyred comrades who died during the Anti-Japanese War. In the vast universe, among the myriad beings coming and going, wise men arise, and heroes emerge. With the outbreak of war, eight years of turmoil ensued, disasters flowed, and the Central Plains were shaken. Our patriots, long known for their integrity, shared hardships together and vowed eternal loyalty. You became national martyrs, unyielding and indomitable, achieving your aspirations, leaving behind lasting renown. Heaven blesses China; the enemy's ambitions were thwarted. They surrendered and submitted, and the wicked were warned. Alas, our martyrs, with the intention to achieve benevolence, witnessed this bright future, and righteous indignation was unleashed. Having perished in the line of duty, we who came after you feel ashamed. Remembering your noble deeds, sorrow rises. A bundle of hay and three rounds of turbid wine are offered. Pouring the libation and laying down the sacrifice, we pay our respects to your heroic spirits. Accept our humble offering." Next, members of the presidium and guests, including Central Committee Member Li Shizeng, Chairman Wu Shaoshu of the City Party Headquarters, Pan Gongzhan, Liu Weizhi, Fang Zhi, and Gu Zhengding, delivered speeches. Finally, Mrs. Yuan Qiongying, the widow of martyr Su Jiarong, spoke on behalf of the relatives of the deceased, stating, in brief, that she was deeply grateful for the memorial service held by various organizations and for their promise to assist the relatives of the deceased. However, she noted that the state, in managing affairs of state, might not be able to fully provide for the needs of the martyrs' families. Therefore, today, she represented the relatives of the deceased in presenting four hopes and requests: 1. The remains of the comrades should be given public burial by the government. 2. Traitors and war criminals should be severely punished. 3. The central government should be petitioned to educate the children of the deceased. 4. A monument to the martyrs should be erected. The ceremony concluded at 3:50 PM.</p>
<h3>More Twists and Turns Than a Detective Novel: The Whole Story of Rong Desheng's Kidnapping Comes to Light; Bandits Divided into Shanghai and Sheng County Gangs; Both Leaders Captured; Ransom Reached a Total of US$395,000</h3>
<p>The kidnapping of flour and cotton magnate Rong Desheng, an event that has drawn national attention, has been subject to much public speculation since the victim was released. It has been learned that in addition to the two key criminals, Song Ersheng and Zheng Liantang, who were captured by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the main culprit, Luo Wenqing (also known as Luo Daqing, Uncle Luo), the leader of the Shanghai gang, and Yuan Zhongzhu (also known as Yuan Zhongshu), the leader of the Sheng County gang, have been arrested by personnel dispatched by the First Pacification Area Headquarters. In addition, Huang Shaoqin, Zhao Shaozong, Wu Zhigang, Liu Ruibiao, Yuan Zhengfei, Gu Chushi and six other individuals were also arrested. Together with the confession and stolen goods, they were transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday afternoon for joint interrogation. The process of solving the case was extremely tortuous and bizarre. Our reporter recently learned the details from relevant sources. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Helping Catch Traitors, Unknowingly Fooled</p>
<p>After the Rong case occurred, Tang, the commander of the First Pacification Area, instructed Mao Sen, the director of the Second Division of the headquarters, to fully assist in the investigation. At the end of May, Director Mao received a report from his staff stationed in Shanghai, stating that the main culprits in the Rong case were Luo Wenqing and Yuan Zhongshu. Yuan and others were notorious bandits with a very tight organization and many informants. Moreover, after the bandits obtained the loot, most of them had already fled. If one wanted to catch them all in one swoop, it would be very difficult.</p>
<p>The headquarters mobilized dozens of experienced personnel, led by Director Mao himself, to be stationed in Shanghai to handle the case. On the 21st of last month, Huang Shaoqin, a key suspect, was secretly arrested. On the 23rd, Liu Ruibiao, a bandit who participated in the Rong case, was arrested in western Zhejiang. Under interrogation, the truth began to emerge. Liu confessed that he had been fooled, believing that he was helping to catch traitors. He regretted it too late after realizing the truth. At the same time, he provided detailed descriptions of the appearances of the major bandits who participated in the kidnapping, such as Uncle Luo, Zhao Shaozong, and Huang A'da. That evening, Yuan, the section chief of the headquarters, found Zhao's residence, and Zhao was captured that night. After the two criminals were confronted, the case gradually became clear. Based on the confessions of the three criminals, the headquarters made further deployments, hoping to capture the bandit leaders. Personnel were dispatched according to the relationships and positions of the bandits to arrest them separately. It was learned that Yuan Zhongzhu, one of the main culprits in the Rong case, had already left Shanghai, leaving only an old woman, Gu Chushi, to guard the bandit's den.</p>
<p>With a Mind to Take a Chance, a Major Culprit is Caught</p>
<p>The personnel of the headquarters had no choice but to enter Yuan's residence and carry out surveillance, strictly preventing any leakage of information. At that time, the Shanghai newspapers published news that the Rong case had been solved and that many of the main culprits in the Rong case had been arrested. Luo Wenqing, the Shanghai gang leader of the Rong case, believed that the report was untrue and, with a mind to take a chance and get to the bottom of things, went to Yuan's residence to visit on the morning of the 25th of last month. Unexpectedly, after entering Yuan's residence, he found that all the people on the mezzanine stairs were strangers, and the situation was unusual. He jumped out of the building, hoping to escape. Lu Zhiling, a member of the Sixth Squad of the Disciplinary Corps of the headquarters, saw the situation and knew that he was a key criminal. In order to capture him, he bravely jumped down, too. Both were injured from the fall. After a long struggle, Luo was captured and confessed to being Uncle Luo. Luo confessed that he had disappeared from Yuan's residence after Rong Desheng's ransom was paid. If it were not for the news report, he would not have gone there. It can be seen that the capture of this major culprit was greatly assisted by the media's reporting. However, the major culprit was extremely cunning and untruthful in many of his statements. It was very difficult to obtain clues about the other main culprit, Yuan, from Luo's mouth. Coincidentally, Huang, the section chief sent by the headquarters to Hangzhou, captured Yuan Zhongzhu, another bandit leader, on the night of February 24 and escorted him to Shanghai on the 25th. At this point, both major leaders of the Rong case kidnappers were captured.</p>
<p>By Chance, a Key Lead is Found</p>
<p>According to Huang's report, Yuan had left Shanghai with his entire family and traveled to other places after kidnapping Rong. The headquarters determined, based on various intelligence reports, that Yuan was hiding in the Hangzhou-Shaoxing area. On the morning of the 24th, Huang was sent to Hangzhou to investigate and arrest him. After arriving in Hangzhou, Huang first paid attention to the major hotels along the West Lake. That night was unusually hot. Huang and others sat for a while in the ice room. Coincidentally, he caught a glimpse of two young women sitting next to him. One of them resembled Yuan's wife. He followed them out and tailed them along the Lakeside area all night. One of the women eventually entered the Xintai Hotel and was lost. Huang then checked the guest registration book and found a person named Yuan Zhengfei. Although the age was quite different, it was remarkably homophonic. After further meticulous investigation, it was revealed that it was Yuan Zhongzhu. After discovering the key criminal, Huang made arrangements that night and, with the assistance of Lin, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Hangzhou Police Bureau, used the pretext of checking the hotel at 4:00 AM on the 25th to capture the major bandit Yuan Zhongzhu and three others in one fell swoop. He was escorted to Shanghai that day, and the case was finally brought to light.</p>
<p>Presenting a Fake Certificate to Help Rong Onto the Car</p>
<p>As for the kidnapping of Rong Desheng, according to the confessions of the bandits, Luo Wenqing, the Shanghai gang leader of the Rong case, and Yuan Zhongzhu, the Sheng County gang leader, cooperated. Luo first received a report from his accomplice Zou Liantang, saying that Rong Desheng was the richest man in Shanghai and that kidnapping him would be very easy. They then discussed it with Yuan Zhongzhu. After the two bandits discussed, they had an insider spy on the entrance to Rong's residence and Rong's appearance. On April 21, Luo and his accomplices Zhang Shaoqing and Huang A'hu and others drove the car borrowed from Wu Zhigang to the vicinity of Rong's residence to kidnap him, waiting for half an hour without success. At 9:00 AM on the 24th of the same month, kidnapper Liu Ruibiao joined them again. They drove the original car and fabricated a similar red arrest warrant and went to wait again. After about ten minutes, they saw Rong's car drive out. Zhang Shaoqing ordered Rong's car to stop for inspection. Huang A'hu briefly showed the red certificate and then forcibly took Rong onto the car. They drove west at high speed, passing through Zhongshan Park (formerly Zhaoti Park) and Zhongshan Road to the vicinity of the power plant north of Caojiadu. They got off the car at Xiaobangbian and helped Rong onto a civilian boat that had been prepared in advance. Three days later, he was moved into a tile house next to the railway in Zhongshan Park. Zheng Liantang then negotiated the ransom, which totaled US$395,000, which was divided into sixteen and a half shares. The Shanghai gang got eight shares, and the Sheng County gang got eight and a half shares. Rong was then released. According to Wu Zhigang, the owner of the car, he received a share of US$30,000.</p>
<p>The First Pacification Area ordered that since the case was clear, the eight suspects in the case, Luo Wenqing, Yuan Zhongzhu, Huang Shaoqin, Zhao Shaozong, Wu Zhigang, Liu Ruibiao, Yuan Zhengfei, and Gu Chushi, along with eight confessions, US$58,910 in stolen money, 119.09 taels of gold, 10,613,800 legal tender, two gold watches, two gold watch chains, and five guns, as well as a list of stolen goods, were all transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday afternoon for inventory and joint interrogation.</p>

<h3>Jianghai Customs Sets Up Light Buoy off the Coast of Songkou</h3>
<p>The sea routes of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are the only way to travel for both Chinese and foreign ships. However, they often suffer from losing their direction during hurricanes and heavy fog, leading to dangers such as reefs and grounding. The General Tax Office of Jianghai Customs, in view of this, has set up eight-foot-diameter Agate coal gas light buoys at the Baoshan buoy (i.e. the buoy indicating navigation), the Qiao buoy, and the eastern entrance buoy of the Baimaisha South Channel, which are located in the area from Wusongkou to Yaojiangzui, to start emitting light, so as to facilitate navigation.</p>
<h3>Planning to Overcome the Difficulties of the Lean Season; Nanjing and Shanghai Plan to Implement a Public Grain Sales System; Minister Xu Published an Important Speech Yesterday; Levying of Grain in Kind Can Enable the Government to Control Grain Prices</h3>
<p>Minister of Food Xu Kan met with reporters at his private residence at 9:00 AM yesterday to clarify issues related to the grain supply in this city, the levying of grain in kind, and the public sale of grain. He first stated: "When I came to Shanghai last week, I discussed the issue of public food with President Zhu and Mayor Wu and reached a concrete plan. We can rest easy about the grain supply for this month. This time, I came to Shanghai again to discuss how to safely overcome the lean season and plan to implement a public grain sales system. For the former, the principle is to ensure that supply and demand are equal, to replenish reserves, and to facilitate the flow of sources. In the past, I have made efforts in this regard, and I am confident that there are about 150,000 tons of foreign rice being shipped to China. This time, I will further divert Gan rice to Shanghai to make up for the shortfall. In terms of Sichuan transportation,</p>
<p>I have agreed on a solution with Mr. Lu Zuofu this morning to allocate most of the company's tonnage to grain transportation. President Song also agreed to allocate five landing craft to jointly transport with the company. China Merchants Bureau will then add fifteen landing craft to join. In this way, more than 300,000 dans of Sichuan grain can come to Shanghai after the middle of this month. It is also estimated that more than 200,000 dans of Gan rice will come from Nanchang, Poyang Lake and Jiujiang to Shanghai every month. In addition to a very small portion being used as military grain, the rest will be used for civilian food." Xu also added: "The French economic representative Mokes has recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and is scheduled to meet with President Song at 11:00 AM this morning to discuss the sale of Saigon rice to enemy countries." Xu also said: "Shanghai is a purely consumer area. If legitimate rice merchants freely transport and supply rice to make up for the shortfall, they should be supported and encouraged. On the contrary, illegal merchants should be severely punished and cracked down on." At this point, Xu believed that the food control methods recently implemented by Mayor Wu were a combination of politics and economics and were very appropriate. The achievements in the future will be very considerable. Implementing public sales can solve the problem of adequate food. This was Xu's opening remark in response to the public sale of food. He went on to say that in accordance with President Chiang's personal instruction and instructions, it was decided to implement it after the autumn harvest, starting with Nanjing and Shanghai, and then promoting it to major cities across the country. However, preparations must be made in advance, such as clearing household registration, balancing supply, how to allocate and sell, and the qualifications and experience of managers, so as to cooperate with national policy and habits and avoid doing things blindly. Since last month, the police in Nanjing and Shanghai have received instructions from the President to allocate five pecks of rice per person.</p>
<p>Anhui Grain is Not Exploiting Farmers</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of levying grain in kind, Xu replied: "The levy of grain under this system is directly levied from landlords and does not exploit farmers, and it eliminates any other apportionments. If the currency system stabilizes in the future, the method of levying currency will be restored. In addition, each county will set up a levy supervision committee and invite local well-known figures to participate in supervision."</p>
<p>Kept Silent on the Grain Loan Case</p>
<p>When reporters asked for his opinion on the grain loan case, Xu remained silent. He briefly said: "Before holding the grain loan, the principles have been carefully considered and the regulations are very strict. The list of grain loan merchants is submitted by the Examination Committee. The points such as the fact that the grain loan cannot be used for other purposes and the cost of imported goods have been reviewed are perfect. However, whether there is any corruption by the executor is being reviewed by the military law and judicial departments, and a correct announcement will be made in the future." Regarding the full text of the response to the impeachment book of Inspector Cheng Zhongxing, Xu promised to publish it tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Inflated Rice Prices, Another Rice Shop Owner Detained</h3>

<h3>Coal Ball King, Shen Jinzhou, Manager of Yitaixing, Suspected of Serious Charges of Colluding with the Enemy, Prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Shen Jinzhou, manager of Yitaixing Coal Shop, known as the "Coal Ball King," colluded with a small number of coal industry outcasts during the enemy puppet period and was instructed by the enemy's "Asia Development Board" and the enemy's puppet "Embassy" to organize the so-called "Dazhong Lian Coal Shop." Shen Jinzhou served as "Chairman" and implemented coal catty control on behalf of the enemy, planned to supply coal catties to the enemy army, and used vile means to promote the so-called "two-currency system" of military tickets and puppet currency for the enemy. Furthermore, he used the power of the enemy puppets to oppress his peers. Therefore, people in the coal industry deeply hated his behavior. After the victory, the coal industry colleagues, following the Li Ze case, jointly reported him by 127 companies, collected 33 pieces of evidence, and stated nine major crimes. They submitted a report to the Shanghai Higher Court Inspection Office and the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission. Shen Mianzhou could not hide and was finally arrested and imprisoned on May 2 of this year. After several investigations by the High Prosecutor's Office, it was confirmed that Shen Jinzhou had the crime of being a traitor, so he was formally prosecuted a few days ago and sent to the High Court for legal prosecution. In addition, the case of Mao Tiemei's suspicion of being a traitor was also prosecuted at the same time and will be publicly tried in the Tilanqiao High Court in the near future. In addition, the case of Xu Ganfang's suspicion of being a traitor was not prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office due to insufficient evidence.</p>
<h3>Bitter Winds and Hard Rains See Off Returning People: Northeastern Refugees Return to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>Amidst the dreary wind and rain, this reporter visited the Northeastern refugees in Shanghai who are about to return to their distant hometowns.</p>
<p>The Fengtian-class ocean liner has already docked in the Huangpu River, quietly waiting for them to board at 2:30 PM today. Tomorrow morning, it will set sail, braving the wind and waves towards Husa Island. It is expected that in six days, they will be safely returned to their homeland, which they have been separated from for over a decade, never again to be homeless and never again to sleep in the open – at least, that is my hope.</p>
<p>Wandering, Wandering</p>
<p>There are over two hundred and seventy of them together, men, women, old people, and children, all refugees who fled to avoid living under the enemy's iron heel. They wandered and wandered, enduring countless hardships until today, the day of victory. Now they have only one wish: to go home! "We want to go home, go home—no matter how fragmented the Northeast is, we want to go back and see!" They told me this in low, but firm tones, when I visited yesterday despite the slanting wind and drizzle.</p>
<p>The "Northeastern Compatriot Reception Center" is a dilapidated house with no doors or windows. Amidst the war-torn ruins of the Nanshi district, it appears even more desolate and dilapidated. Upon entering, one sees simple beds placed on the damp ground. Upstairs—in a dilapidated building with bare walls—Japanese-style "tatami" mats are spread on the floor, where Northeastern refugees are lying in twos and threes.</p>
<p>Rushing up to greet the reporter was a burly man named Lan, and an old Mr. Zhao who had graduated from "Army University" and served as a chief of staff. "Most of us are from Liaoning and Jilin," said Mr. Lan, "some of us have been out for seven or eight years, some for three or five years." He then pointed to old Mr. Zhao and said, "He retreated with the Northeastern Army back in the September 18th Incident."</p>
<p>Most of them are public educators and demobilized soldiers. Some had fought in Southern Shandong with the late General Yu Xuezhong; others had wandered around the front lines of the Central Plains and Taihang Mountains. Several soldiers had died in battle, and their widowed wives and orphaned children had come here with the rest. The reporter casually mentioned the grandmother of the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang, asking, "Does she also live here?" They confirmed it, but said it was the Young Marshal's maternal grandmother.</p>
<p>Thinking of Home</p>
<p>Every one of them longs for their hometown. "Our hometown has soybeans as fat as little fingers and sorghum as thick as a person." They recounted the richness of the Northeast, the vastness of the land, and the scarcity of the population. "We all have homes, and our homes are still there, but we couldn't bear the enemy's invasion, so we fled into the interior. Before, we braved artillery fire, running and escaping, enduring hardships willingly, but now that we have won, there seems to be no need to wander anymore—we want to return home."</p>
<p>But returning home also has difficulties. Transportation and travel expenses are the biggest problems. Mr. Xu, the person in charge here (at the Northeastern Compatriot Reception Center), told me that they are the first group sent back by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (行總). Compatriots with money have already left on their own. To help the refugees return home, the first Northeastern Shanghai Compatriot Association was established in March of this year. Ding Guitang, born in Liaoning, has devoted his utmost enthusiasm, and he has been working tirelessly to solve their food and accommodation problems.</p>
<p>Pride prevents the Northeastern compatriots from uttering words of begging, but a glimpse into the kitchen allows one to imagine that the coarse, yellow food they eat every day is not very palatable. Several people have fallen ill (because the inside is dirty and there are too many flies). They quietly go out to find a cheap doctor. But what surprised me the most was when a woman told me: "This used to be a funeral parlor of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, where coffins were kept!" Is that so? No wonder there still seems to be a suffocating atmosphere – but they have stayed here for over forty days after all.</p>
<p>Efforts to Build</p>
<p>The reporter wanted to know what they would be willing to do after returning home. Old Mr. Zhao said, "We are willing to do our bit to help the government build the Northeast." What exactly will they do? Up until last night, they were still discussing with Mr. Mo Dehui, who promised to help them settle down.</p>
<p>The rain stopped a bit, and they saw me out the door, saying as they walked, "We can board the ship tomorrow, but there are still over ten thousand fellow refugees from various places in Xuzhou coming. We hope that you can advocate for them, and it would be best if they didn't have to live in this unclean house." Only those in suffering understand how to help others. Fellow suffering compatriots, may you cherish your future journey! (Zhongshi)</p>

<h3>Major Embezzlement Case at the Two Railway Bureaus: District Prosecutor's Office to Investigate Today; Expresses Regret Over Delayed Transfer by the Railway Bureau</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled the first investigation of the embezzlement case at the Two Railway Bureaus for 10:00 AM today, to be conducted by Prosecutor Quan. All of the defendants will be interrogated at that time. Chen Jingyin, Yu Peien, and He Zu'en, who have not yet been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, all wrote "confessions" during their interrogation by the police. However, Prosecutor Quan stated that he has not yet received these documents. The Railway Police Bureau's independent investigation of this case has lasted as long as ten days, which is already inappropriate. Furthermore, after the transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office, there are missing documents and no comprehensive investigative report, which is affecting the speed of the investigation. The Prosecutor's Office expressed regret about this; however, they hope that the accomplices and documents that have not yet been transferred to their office will be transferred as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Shortening Electricity Restriction Time: French-Operated Water and Electricity Company Complies</h3>

The association believed that this measure by the French-operated Water and Electricity Company was hindering the overall efficiency of industrial production. Therefore, on June 6, it submitted a report to the relevant municipal authorities, ordering the company to cancel the ban on the use of motor power, or to change the suspension time, taking into account the actual situation, to 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM daily. This method has been accepted by the Public Utilities Bureau, and the French-operated Water and Electricity Company has been ordered to comply.</p>

<h3>Guangxi University Resumes Classes in Guilin After Relocation from Liuzhou</h3>
<p>Recruiting New Students in Late August</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, May 5] National Guangxi University, upon orders, has relocated from Liuzhou to its original site in Guilin to resume classes. The fourth year has already started classes on the 20th of last month, and the second and third years are scheduled to start classes on the 8th of this month. This year, it plans to recruit 510 new students, which will be held around late August. Principal Chen Jianzhong said: Hiring professors is the most difficult task. The Ministry of Education has promised to allocate 700 million yuan, but it is still insufficient.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Guilin] After the resignation of former Principal Li of Guangxi University, Chen Jianzhong took over and arrived at the school on March 9 of this year, establishing a relocation committee to take charge of the matter. In order to improve the Agricultural College, the school decided to move back to the old site of Liangfeng in Guilin from the Zhenjiang River in Liuzhou, in order to utilize the nearby open space to develop agriculture, forestry, nurseries, horticulture, etc. The remaining buildings will be used for the first-year students of each department to attend classes together in Liangfeng. The school was repeatedly relocated due to the impact of the Xiang-Gui War two years ago. Last August, it suffered severe losses in the mountain flood disaster in Rongjiang, Guizhou. Later, it was located in the extremely simple Zhenjiang River in a remote rural area, prompting repeated requests for relocation. After the turmoil, some students went to Wu.

<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper, Hangzhou] Zhu Jingnong, the Deputy Minister of Education, came to Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 4th to discuss important public matters with Xu Shaodi, the Director of Education of Zhejiang Province, and is expected to stay for several days. It is said that the complete restoration of various universities is difficult due to insufficient ships and vehicles, and the transportation is difficult. In addition, many school buildings need to be repaired and added, so in fact it will take a considerable amount of time to complete the eastward relocation.

Educational funding accounts for only 4.7% of the total budget, and even with the addition of restoration funding and recent salary adjustments, it accounts for just over 5%.

Scientific experiment equipment for universities will be purchased from domestic and foreign countries, and the Ministry of Education plans to establish factories to manufacture equipment for secondary schools in order to supply them universally.

Although Miss Brough lost in the singles final, she teamed up with Miss Osborne in the doubles final to defeat Miss Betz and Miss Hart 6-3, 2-6, 6-3. Miss Betz suffered from a disadvantage due to her weaker physical condition. Competing in both singles and doubles made her appear quite fatigued, while Brough became more and more courageous.

<h3>The World's Number One Swimmer, Tarzan the Ape Man, Weissmuller, Once Swept All World Swimming Records, His 100-Yard Freestyle Record Remains Unbroken</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hollywood, 6th] "Tarzan the Ape Man" Weissmuller was once the world's number one swimmer. Although Weissmuller has given up swimming for many years, his world swimming records have not yet been completely broken. In the history of world swimming records, there was a time when Weissmuller held all swimming records from 50 yards to 440 yards. Even today, his 51-second 100-yard freestyle record remains unbroken. This record has recently been threatened by Yale University athlete Ford, but Ford and no one else has been able to create a record under 50 seconds. Weissmuller created a record of 49.8 seconds in 1927, which was unbelievable to everyone, but this record was not officially recognized as a world record because it was created in a 20-yard swimming pool, which did not meet the rules. Weissmuller is 42 years old this year and feels like swimming is passing him by. He now mainly enjoys playing golf, but he plans to swim twice a week for the next year. Last year, his 100-yard record was 53 seconds, and today, only a few people can create this record. Since Weissmuller retired from public swimming competitions 15 years ago, he has seen all of his swimming records broken, except for the 100-yard freestyle record, which he believes he can maintain for a considerable time. According to Weissmuller, "Today's swimming talents are trained by university coaches. These coaches overemphasize calisthenics, not knowing that excessive exercise outside the water and muscle development are counterproductive."</p>

<h3>Answers to Questions Regarding Household Registration</h3>
<p>Question: I am a Shanghai resident and have already registered my household with the district office in this district. Now I want to go to Nanjing to do business. How should I register? As a local resident, I definitely don't have a "native place." If you are going to Nanjing to do business temporarily and don't intend to stay there for a long time, meaning you are "moving out of the original household registration jurisdiction" but don't want to "change your original affiliation," you only need to complete a move-out registration.</p>
<p>Question: What if I want to live in Nanjing for a long time?</p>
<p>Answer: This needs to be discussed in two ways: If you intend to live in Nanjing for a long time and decide to remove your native place from this city, then you can apply for cancellation of registration in this city and apply for registration in Nanjing at the same time. If you want to live in Nanjing permanently but, because your ancestral home is here or for other reasons, you don't want to remove your native place from this city, then you still maintain your native place in this city, and you need to follow the steps. If you have not stayed for a month, you need to report to the head of the original residence for floating population registration. If you have stayed for a month, you need to report for migration registration. After one year, you can apply for establishment of a temporary residence according to Article 18, paragraph 2 of the New Household Registration Law, which states that "those who already have a native place but have a residence or have lived in another county for more than one year shall take that county as their temporary residence."</p>
<p>Question: What is a "native place"?</p>
<p>Answer: The so-called "native place" is what determines the relationship between a person and where they live, and recognizes the standard by which a person is assigned rights and obligations in the area where they live. Shanghai residents exercise rights and fulfill obligations in Shanghai, while Nanjing residents exercise rights and fulfill obligations in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Question: What is a "temporary residence"?</p>
<p>Answer: The so-called "temporary residence" was originally intended to alleviate the shortcomings of "native place." If a person has lived in their current residence for a certain amount of time, they will be quite familiar with the situation there. If all rights and obligations must be exercised and fulfilled in their native place, it would be difficult in practice. Therefore, it is stipulated that people from other places can apply for the establishment of a temporary residence after living for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Question: Are there any differences between "native place" residents and "temporary residence" residents in this city in exercising rights and fulfilling obligations?</p>
<p>Answer: According to the interpretation order Yu Hu Zi No. 0143 issued by the Ministry of Interior on February 18, 1943, "The regulation of temporary residence is to alleviate the shortcomings of native place. If you have already lived in the place of temporary residence, you should exercise your rights and fulfill your obligations there, but if the laws and regulations by which rights and obligations are granted stipulate otherwise, then follow those regulations." So, in principle, there is no significant difference.</p>
<h3>Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Household Registration Law (8)</h3>
<p>1.  Registration of Category: Those who establish or cancel registration due to obtaining, recovering, or losing nationality.</p>
<p>2.  Recognition Registration: Those who are recognized according to a will.</p>
<p>3.  Adoption Registration: Those who were not raised as children from a young age.</p>
<p>4.  Marriage Registration: Those whose marriage requires the consent of a legal representative, and those whose registration is revoked due to invalid or canceled marriage.</p>
<p>5.  Divorce Registration.</p>
<p>6.  Death Declaration Registration and Those who Revoke Death Declarations.</p>
<p>7.  Those who change, correct, or cancel registration due to a confirmed judgment.</p>
<p>(Article 24) After receiving the registration application, the township office should review it to ensure it is correct and register it in the main household registration book. The original application form should be given a cover and bound as a separate volume of the household registration book. A copy of the application form should be transcribed and submitted to the county government at the end of each month for registration in the duplicate household registration book, and still bound as a separate volume. Both should be marked with the type of registration: category registration, identity registration, or migration registration.</p>
<p>(Article 25) Registered items should be recorded in the registration reason column of the household registration book or within the relevant household. Establishing registration, moving in, or creating a new household should be recorded on a new page of the registration book in the appropriate order. Cancellation of registration, death, and death declaration should be marked with a red line, stating the date and reason.</p>
<p>For those who use cards for registration, the registration should be recorded on the original card, and new cards should be added or replaced. All household registration books with fully canceled pages and canceled cards should be classified and preserved. (Article 26) When non-native residents perform category or identity registration, with the exception of category registration and migration registration being handled at the same time and requiring applications in both places, the township office that accepts the application should notify the township office in the applicant's native region with a copy of the application form for registration, but if there is no notification in the applicant's native region, notification may not be required.</p>

<h3>The Taiwan Sugar Corporation is Illegal: Sugar Industry Association Resolutely Opposes It. Monopoly...Price Gouging...Profit-Seeking...These are the Main Reasons</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Before the war, Taiwan's sugar mainly came from Taikoo, Java, and Dongbai. After the victory, the sources were cut off, and all reliance was placed on Taiwan Sugar for supply. There were a total of forty-two sugar factories throughout Taiwan Province. After being taken over, it is said that no more than seventeen can still operate. However, due to the province's suitability for three rice crops a year, while sugarcane is planted only once a year, and the cost of fertilizer is not low, since the military takeover, most of the fields have been abandoned. Due to limited raw materials, factories have been starting and stopping again. The sugar produced totals 90,000 tons, plus 150,000 tons of stored sugar taken over. This is the only source of sugar after the victory. As for the resumption of sugar factory operations, it is said that it will take eighteen months because the stored sugar is limited and the supply is still far off.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Company's Organization</p>
<p>Therefore, the Resources Committee and the Taiwan Governor-General's Office jointly formed the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which was announced in May. The reason, of course, is to regulate supply and demand, maintain the market, and revive Taiwan Province's sugar industry. However, since its establishment, it has only been a little over a month, and the price of sugar has doubled, causing great attention in society, especially in the sugar industry.</p>
<p>Reasons for Opposing the Company</p>
<p>The reasons are:</p>
<p>1. The company's exclusive control over the transportation and sale of Taiwan sugar is a monopoly.</p>
<p>2. The organization is illegal. The so-called joint-stock company, it is unknown who the directors and supervisors are and what the capital is.</p>
<p>3. Raising the selling price is equivalent to leading price increases.</p>
<p>4. Selling directly to retail merchants is no different from cutting off the livelihood of sugar merchants.</p>
<p>5. The fundamental issues of Taiwan's sugar manufacturing and sugarcane cultivation have not seen any improvements.</p>
<p>6. Sugar manufacturing belongs to light industry and should not be nationalized, competing with merchants for profit.</p>
<p>Planned Steps for Vigorous Advocacy</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the industry has decided:</p>
<p>(1) Prepare a document and submit it to President Chiang of the National Government, Premier Zhu of the Executive Yuan, and the Jiangsu Inspector, Mayor Wu of Shanghai, and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting the prompt revocation of the company's establishment.</p>
<p>(2) Organize a petition group to go to Beijing to petition the Supreme National Defense Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Control Yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Urgently request the support of the National Chamber of Commerce Joint Federation and other committees, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and various industry associations, and not stop until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>It is said that the sign at the entrance of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is "Taiwan Sugar Corporation," but the letterhead is signed "Sugar Industry Company jointly organized by the Resources Committee of the Executive Yuan and the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office." The industry believes that it is neither fish nor fowl, and since its establishment a month ago, it has not joined the association as required, so it is determined to oppose it. The following is an excerpt from its petition.</p>
<p>Excerpt of Key Points from the Original Petition</p>
<p>It is known that Taiwan is famous for sugar production. After many years of operation by the Japanese, the production was quite abundant. In addition to meeting Japan's needs, the surplus was dumped in our country. However, since the restoration of Taiwan Province, many vast sugarcane fields have been left barren, and manufacturing equipment has been allowed to be discarded. The remaining sugar is only 200,000 tons. Future production is a major question. The sugar merchants affiliated with the association, because of the influx of foreign sugar in 1933, contracted with six sugar factories established in Guangdong Province to undertake sales, responsible for operation, and promoting sugarcane crops, which greatly increased sugar production. Furthermore, they united with colleagues from various places to organize the National Domestic Sugar Production and Sales Association, competing with foreign sugar, and achieved significant results. Therefore, with the aim of , the association contacted the Taiwan provincial authorities to discuss production and sales cooperation, and following the example of Guangdong sugar, only took commissions and did not engage in speculation. The production and sales parties, considering the domestic market conditions, negotiated the selling price. They would not sell foreign sugar unless Taiwan sugar stopped supplying, so that domestic sugar would gradually develop and the economy would move towards health. An agreement had been reached and efforts were about to be made in a timely manner. Unexpectedly, the Resources Committee encompassed the stored sugar in Taiwan Province and established the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, monopolizing operations and competing with merchants for profit. On May 22 of this year, the company was established and announced publicly. The target of sugar sales is not limited to sugar merchants, replacement and exclusion are clearly revealed. From May 24 to June 14, in a two-week period, sugar was sold four times, the price gradually increased, and the goods were secretly reduced. The existence or non-existence of transactions was determined by the closeness of relationships, using brokers as intermediaries, breeding corruption and chaos. Furthermore, domestic associations were utilized to sell in stages, causing the price of sugar to jump nearly double. Coupled with the increase in miscellaneous fees and numerous transfers, the market price became more expensive. Not only was there hoarding and speculation, but also arbitrary manipulation, so that the long-stable price of sugar, within half a month, jumped from about 50,000 yuan per picul to over 100,000 yuan, the market situation fell into chaos, and merchants were at a loss. The Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property Management in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, since December of last year, has entrusted the association to sell sugar received from Taiwan to colleagues through auction, and there has never been any manipulation. In half a year, the selling price has always hovered around 50,000 yuan, with a total volume of more than 120,000 . The value exceeded 6 billion yuan. Even with the prices of various commodities rising, the price of sugar has always been stable, which has won social praise. It was not easy, but it was completely destroyed by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation within two weeks. Monopoly and high prices have caused panic. Even foreigners are worried. The Resources Committee is the highest national organization, responsible for defense industry and heavy industry. Following the first-stage economic construction principles set by the Supreme National Defense Council, private commercial operations are by no means the committee's responsibility. Even if we take a step back and recognize that Taiwan Province's refining industry cannot be improved without the committee's efforts, it can only engage in matters related to refining and provide funding for the transition. Now, taking advantage of its advantages, it violates the principles of economic construction and brazenly establishes the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to compete with merchants for profit. Its handling has not even been a month, and hundreds of problems have arisen. It even intends to establish branches in important commercial ports to further destroy sugar merchants across the country. What is its intention? Currently, there is a shortage in the country, and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation can still manipulate . One day, foreign sugar arrives and dumps , if the government cannot establish its position, the hearts of merchants will be more than enough to turn it around. Therefore, the Resources Committee's competition with merchants for profit is more unwise than killing the chicken to get the eggs. The authorities should promptly revoke the establishment of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and allow the association to continue the joint operation method of food sugar production and sales cooperation with the Taiwan Provincial authorities, so that the future price of sugar will naturally be negotiated fairly by the production and sales parties, considering the market situation, under the guidance of the local government, so as to implement the established national policy and satisfy the public.</p>

<h3>British-owned Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Steamship Companies to Reorganize as Chinese Companies to Continue Coastal and Inland River Shipping Rights</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been speculation that foreign steamship companies will change to Chinese names and continue to operate as usual. According to sources, the Chinese company organized by Taikoo will be nominally headed by a former employee of the foreign firm. Jardine Matheson will organize the Anhe Company, nominally a Sino-foreign joint venture, including a former employee of the foreign firm and a certain Sichuan bank. All of Jardine Matheson's ships, large and small, will be gradually transferred to Anhe, flying the Chinese flag and operating on inland rivers and coastal routes.</p>
<h3>Canada Raises Currency Value, Controls Prices, and Restricts Imports to Counter U.S. Inflation</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Ottawa, 6th) The Canadian government today fixed the value of the Canadian dollar to be equal to the U.S. dollar and strengthened price controls to counter recent U.S. price increases and reduce inflationary pressure. Finance Minister Ilsley told the House of Commons that he hoped the steps taken by the government would "permanently guarantee Canada's immunity from adverse external conditions and reduce inflationary pressures." The agent banks designated by the Foreign Exchange Control Board will buy U.S. dollars at a value of one Canadian dollar instead of buying at 1.10 Canadian dollars, and sell at 1.005 Canadian dollars instead of the previous 1.105 Canadian dollars. As for the pound sterling, it is fixed at a value of 4.02 Canadian dollars per pound instead of the previous 4.43 Canadian dollars, and sold at 4.04 Canadian dollars instead of 4.45 Canadian dollars. The government also announced a long list of items that will remain under control, and imports will be strictly controlled. At the same time, subsidy measures will remain in place.</p>
<p>(United Press, New York, 6th) Regarding the devaluation of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, it is generally interpreted here as a result of Canada's accumulation of a large amount of U.S. dollars. By the end of 1945, Canada held gold and U.S. dollars worth more than 1.5 billion Canadian dollars.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Speculative Behavior of Securities Firms</h3>

<h3>China Petroleum Corporation Inspects the Kaohsiung Oil Field</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The petroleum production of the Kaohsiung Oil Field in Taiwan played a very important role during the Japanese war of aggression. It was heavily bombed by American aircraft and production was suspended. Since the end of the war, production has come to a standstill. It is said that the China Petroleum Corporation, under the Resources Committee, attaches great importance to the value of the fields and plans to send personnel to the area in the near future to conduct exploration work, inspect the extent of the damage to the oil field, prepare for construction and repairs, and order new equipment from the United States in order to restore production. It is said that the quality of petroleum produced in Kaohsiung is also very good. If handled properly, its future prospects are very promising, even better than the Gansu oil mines, and will be of great importance to China's oil and stone industry in the future.</p>
<h3>Past and Present of the Woolen Fabric Industry</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric trade in Shanghai dates back more than thirty years before the founding of the Republic of China, but at that time there were no formal shops selling them. Since the first year of the Republic of China, the woolen fabric and Western clothing trades gradually emerged. Later, due to clothing reforms, the sales of woolen fabrics became widespread, and the number of shops opening increased rapidly. Therefore, an association was formed. During the years 1924-1926, Western suits and overcoats became increasingly popular, and the demand from this street and from out-of-town merchants also increased day by day. Chinese clothing materials also mostly selected woolen fabrics, and the power of the Dalu gang on Qipan Street exceeded that of the shipping gang in Hongkou. Therefore, the Tongying Association also moved from Hongkou to the Shanghai district. Afterwards, the sales of woolen fabrics in various provinces and cities increased year by year, and the number of stores opened by colleagues increased rapidly. Today, the breadth of sales has exceeded the limits of those doing silk, satin, and foreign goods. Most of them undoubtedly sell woolen goods, and the number of stores of this type has gradually increased. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Woolen Fabric Association had about forty member stores, seventy-five stores in 1933, ninety-four stores before the war in 1937, one hundred and nine stores in 1940, three hundred and forty-one stores in 1942, and four hundred and seventeen stores before the victory in 1945. On March 1 of this year, after reorganization and takeover, the official number of members was one hundred and sixty-seven. According to the records of 1942 and 1945, due to enemy and puppet control, woolen fabric sales of more than twenty yards had to be stamped with a transport permit, and those forced to join numbered . At the same time, due to the special nature of silk fabrics in this city, many outsiders entered the field. After the victory, due to currency issues, the number of new members was delayed. Later, due to frequent price increases, increased capital and bonuses, and higher opening costs, business became difficult, and many merged or closed down. Thirdly, after joining the association, the public and private expenses became a heavy burden, and the obligations were often greater than the rights, so many hesitated to observe. This is the real reason why the number of members has decreased recently. （　）</p>

<h3>Printing and Dyeing Raw Materials and Pigment Chemistry</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bo'an</p>
<p>Since Perkin discovered mauve, the world's dye industry has undergone a major revolution. All colors of the rainbow can be separated from Coal tar in one room and fulfill its desires. The duty-based natural pigments have fallen, never to rise again for thousands of years. Not only that, but high-grade explosives, combustion products, gas, and valuable medicines also come from coal tar. The power of life and death is truly in the hands of this industry. In this sense, the dye industry is a major part of the people's livelihood industry in peacetime, and it is the lifeline of the country in wartime. Isn't it great?</p>
<p>The use of coal tar in dyes is very precise. It is usually separated into benzene, toluene, xylene, cumene, phenol, benzene, phenanthrene, anthracene, etc. according to the height of its separation temperature and the height of its specific gravity. Phenol is a light oil, xylene and below are medium oil, and anthracene and phenanthrene are heavy oil. After the tar is separated, it is combined with intermediate compounds to become colorful dyes.</p>
<p>The German coal tar industry is particularly developed, and most inventions were started by Germans. The progress of German dry distillation of lignite has been praised by countries all over the world, so pigment chemistry is also dominant in the world. It is not surprising that Germans use coal tar so widely. Before the European War, due to the fear that coal resources would be exhausted, all coal-based organisms were resolved with hydroelectric power according to the molecular formula of C.H., which was an unparalleled masterpiece.</p>
<p>From the perspective of organic chemistry principles, the synthesis of mineral oxides is not impossible, and the Germans have realized it one by one. Observe the German synthesis of phenol to the synthesis of acetic acid and formaldehyde, which are made from hydroelectricity. In the manufacturing process, only the steam furnace emits a large amount of steam. This steam passes through a red copper tube, and the copper tube contains porous iron sponge with ammonia. After the steam passes through the red copper tube, the oxygen in the water is excluded due to radiation, leaving oxygen. Oxygen is introduced into a gas mixing ball, which is equipped with two arc carbon electrodes. When current is applied, the two hydrogen atoms and two carbon electrodes in the water react to form C H gas. The ethyne gas is then introduced into a red-hot tube, where polymerization occurs to become C H , which is benzene. Continuing down this path, propylene, formaldehyde, and even methylanthracene, are all possible, and the quality of synthetic products does not need to be tested and is the purest. It is said that the Germans used benzene produced by this method for aviation fuel during the European War, which is another page in the history of scientific development that cannot be erased. Aviation fuel requires octane, which has extinguishing properties, so ordinary gasoline originally contained benzene as an extinguishing agent.</p>
<p>The above is the source of dyes. However, there are indirect dyes and direct dyes among the dyes. Direct dyes will not be mentioned for the time being. Now let's talk about indirect dyes. Indirect dyeing relies on chemical reactions, among which the most important are Anthracene and Indanthrene.</p>

<h3>Striving for Peace and Construction: Please Revisit the Eight Years of Arduous Resistance War (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>……Our Newspaper's Archives……</p>
<p>After the fall of Nanjing, the enemy's second military objective in China was to capture Xuzhou, the center of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.</p>
<p>Due to Han Fuqu's hesitant inaction, the enemy on the northern Tianjin-Pukou Railway took advantage of this momentum and captured Jinan on December 27th, Yanzhou on January 4th, and Jining and Zou County on the 11th. They then turned west to take Jiaxiang, in order to move towards Jining and cut off the Hai (Lianyungang)-Tai'an Railway, encircling Xuzhou. However, by this time, our military situation had been readjusted. In early February, our army counterattacked Jining, and it was not until late February that the enemy managed to occupy Jiaxiang. The enemy advancing south from Zou County to attack Teng County also encountered strong resistance from the Sichuan Army under Wang Mingzhang. They only managed to occupy Teng County in mid-March, and General Wang Mingzhang also died in battle in this campaign. Another enemy offensive in Shandong was to advance from Qingdao along the highway through Zhucheng and Ju County, and then take Yishui in the west, in order to put pressure on the right flank of our army in Linyi. Their purpose was still to threaten Xuzhou. Therefore, in mid-March, there was also a bloody battle at Linyi, but the enemy did not succeed.</p>
<p>Unable to capture Linyi, the enemy turned from the front of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to attack Zaozhuang and Yixian, directly pressing on Taierzhuang. However, in the Battle of Taierzhuang, our army, using mobile offensive defense, achieved an unprecedented victory since the start of the war, annihilating two enemy divisions. In late April, the enemy reinforced their troops and attacked Linyi and Taierzhuang again, and captured Pi County and Tancheng. However, our mobile troops were intertwined with them, holding back their advance and retreat.</p>
<p>In order to complete the encirclement of Xuzhou, the enemy reinforced their troops in northern Jiangsu (Su Bei), namely Dongtai and Yancheng, while also attacking Mengcheng and Yongcheng from Bengbu and Linhuai Pass. At the same time, the enemy troops in southern Shandong advanced southward in three routes. However, the our army in Xuzhou, after exhausting the enemy, retreated across the Guo River under the threat of enemy heavy artillery and aircraft.</p>
<p>The Battle of Xuzhou was actually a strategic victory.</p>
<p>After Xuzhou fell, the enemy captured Kaifeng on June 4th, and on the 12th, the Yellow River was breached. The Japanese army withdrew and then turned south, attacking Shucheng from Hefei, capturing Taihu, and then capturing Susong and Huangmei from Taihu, taking Guangji, Qishui, and Huangpi. Another route went from Shucheng to Liu'an and then to Gushi, and on October 12th, captured Xinyang, Liulin on the Ping-Han Railway front, advancing south along the highway to encircle the northern part of Wuhan. At the same time, the enemy forces on the Yangtze River captured Anqing on June 13th, Hukou on July 4th, and Jiujiang on July 26th, advancing westward. By October, the three-pronged encirclement was complete. However, our army, following the experience of the Battle of Xuzhou, mainly focused on exhausting the enemy, with flanking operations taking precedence over frontal resistance. After holding out for several months, and as the enemy formed an encirclement, our army withdrew from Wuhan on October 25th.</p>
<p>Earlier, the enemy suffered repeated defeats in the Battle of Wuhan, and seeing the weak attitude of Britain and France, they resolutely launched the war in South China, landing in Daya Bay, Huizhou on October 12th. Our army was unprepared, and Guangzhou fell two days before Wuhan.</p>
<p>The retreat from Wuhan, followed by the Battle of Nanchang and the retreat from Nanchang by March of the following year, marked the end of the first phase of the War of Resistance. As the enemy penetrated to a considerable extent, the allocation of their forces gradually reached saturation with the extension of the battle line, and they could no longer spare any effort to launch large-scale offensives. Although we lost a large amount of territory, our main forces were not lost, and the war situation reached a stalemate. During this period, our main task militarily was to stabilize our own strength, strive for the initiative, and drag the enemy into the mud. Politically, it was to purify our own camp and consolidate unity.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the withdrawal from Wuhan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek reiterated the consistent policy of resistance: "First, protracted war; second, total war; and third, striving for the initiative." Hence, "The key to the military victory or defeat of the War of Resistance does not lie in the gains or losses of Wuhan, but in maintaining our enduring power of resistance." At the Nanyue Military Conference held on November 27th of the same year, the Chairman's instruction emphasized that the task of the second phase of the War of Resistance was to turn defense into offense, to turn defeat into victory, and that it would inevitably be doubly arduous, and therefore require double the effort.</p>
<p>On December 19th, Wang Jingwei suddenly left his post and flew to Kunming. On the 22nd, Konoe Fumimaro issued his outrageous declaration to "establish a new order in East Asia." On the 26th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek refuted Konoe's declaration, and on the 29th, Wang Jingwei published his "traitorous telegram." This was an ugly scene of domestic defeatists being purged from the resistance camp after the withdrawal from Wuhan, but the resistance camp became purer and more solid as a result. In particular, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's stern words stated: "Everyone should be aware that his so-called new China is to eliminate an independent China and create a slave China, subject to its domination for generations. This 'new order' is based on China becoming a slave state and being closely linked with Japan and its created 'Manchukuo', with what purpose? In the name of preventing the red peril, to control China's military; in the name of upholding Eastern civilization, to eliminate China's national culture; in the name of eliminating economic barriers, to exclude European and American forces, monopolize the Pacific, and then use the tool of the 'Japan-Manchuria-China economic unit' or 'economic group' to control the lifeline of China's economy."</p>
<p>On January 1, the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang resolved to expel Wang Jingwei from the party, and on June 8, the National Government issued an order to arrest Wang Jingwei.</p>
<p>Although the second phase of the war had basically reached a stalemate, due to the inadequacy of our own strength, we could not stand in an active position, and the enemy was still able to launch its local offensives in a rampant manner.</p>
<p>In May of the 28th year [1939], the enemy troops in Wuhan, feeling threatened by our troops in northern Hubei, launched the so-called "Suizao Campaign." The enemy, detouring north from the east bank of the Xiang River, successively captured Zaoyang, Xinye, and Tanghe, while the enemy invading west from Xinyang also captured Tongbai. However, by the end of May, our army reinforced and counterattacked, successively recovering various places and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.</p>
<p>In September of the same year, the enemy in Nanchang joined forces with the enemy on the Yangtze River in southern Hubei, attempting to jointly attack Changsha. After more than a month, our army counterattacked in early October, and the enemy forces were greatly routed, with more than 40,000 casualties. This was the so-called First Battle of Changsha.</p>
<p>However, in November, the enemy landed again in Beihai, successively capturing Fangcheng and Qin County, and on the 24th, captured Yongning. At the same time, in northern Guangdong, the enemy also captured Baijiang, Yingde, Gaotian, Xinfeng, Wengyuan and other places, supporting each other. In January of the following year, our army counterattacked, successively recovering Zengcheng, Yingde, Gaotian, Baijiang, and Huaxian, but Yongning ultimately fell into enemy hands.</p>
<p>This was the main situation in the stalemate phase. Although our side did not yet have the strength to completely stop the enemy's offensive, so that the enemy could continue to act within our various battlefields, the enemy's offensive was obviously not as sharp and powerful as in the first phase. They often prepared for several months to launch an offensive, perhaps temporarily occupying certain key points, but once we counterattacked, the entire line would shake. Therefore, the result of almost every battle was that the enemy failed. In the Battle of Yichang in the 29th year [1940], the enemy went upstream along the Yangtze River on one side, knocking on the gateway to Yichang, and on the other side, captured Changyang from Jingmen, attacking the rear of Yichang. Although Yichang was lost, the enemy was never able to cross the county seat by a single step to the west. In the Zaohe Battle of the same year, although General Zhang Zizhong died for his country, the enemy was limited to the Funiu Mountains in the north, blocked by the Han River in the west, obstructed by the Dabie Mountains in the east, and obstructed by the Dahong Mountains in the south. Our army waited for an opportunity to counterattack, and was victorious in all directions. In the 30th year [1941], the enemy launched two offensives against Changsha, both of which ended in failure. In particular, the Second Battle of Changsha in September set the highest record of victory for our army in the second phase of the war. In the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign in April of the 31st year [1942], the enemy attempted to connect the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, advancing westward from Xiaoshan and Zhuji on one side, and attacking eastward from Jiujiang and Nanchang on the other, with the two armies meeting in Guixi and Dongxiang. After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line was opened, the enemy became even more complacent and divided their troops southward from Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Jinhua. Xianju, Yongkang, Songyang, and Lishui successively fell. However, by mid-July, our army launched a full-scale counterattack, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy between Suichang, Xuanping, and Yongkang, and successively recovered eastern Zhejiang and northern Jiangxi. In May of the 32nd year [1943], the enemy troops in northern Anhui advanced north from Anqing, capturing Tongcheng and occupying Lihuang, but were repelled by our army in less than half a year. In November of the same year, the enemy troops in Hunan advanced from Shuixi, capturing Jinshi, Li County, and Shimen, crossed the river south to take Linli and Cili, directly threatening Changde, and crossed the Yuan River from Zoushi, closely encircling Changde. Our army fought fiercely with them, with Changde being lost and regained three times. Finally, our main force reinforced the troops and repelled the enemy, causing the enemy's dream of attacking the wartime capital to vanish.</p>
<p>However, by this point, the stalemate between the enemy and us had lasted for a full four years. The enemy was undoubtedly becoming more and more exhausted, but our army's efforts were insufficient, and we had never been able to complete the strategic tasks of the stalemate phase, so-called striving for the initiative, turning defense into offense, and even unable to stop the enemy's continued offensive. In the spring of the 33rd year [1944], the enemy, because of their repeated defeats in the Pacific War, and their million-strong army isolated overseas unable to return home by sea, had no choice but to devote all their strength to make one last offensive, in an attempt to open up the traffic lines of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Ping-Han Railway, so that their overseas troops could withdraw from the mainland. On April 17th, the enemy strongly crossed the flooded area west of Zhongmu and launched the Central Plains Campaign, and on April 22nd, occupied Zhengzhou, and on May 15th, occupied Luoyang. When their westward advance was blocked at Lianggu Pass, they turned south along the Ping-Han Railway. At the same time, the enemy troops in Wuhan also went north to meet them at Zhumadian, opening up the Ping-Han Railway. In mid-June, the enemy captured Changsha and attacked Hengyang along the railway. Our army fought hard for two months, and finally withdrew on August 8th. After Hengyang fell, the enemy captured Weiyang to the south on the 20th. At the same time, the enemy troops in northern Guangdong also went north along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, successively capturing Qingyuan, Yingde, and Qujiang, and joined forces with the enemy advancing south. At this point, both the Ping-Han and Guangdong-Hankou Railways were opened up, and the enemy's arrogance was high and invincible. They then invaded Guangxi along the Hunan-Guangxi Railway, occupying Guilin on November 10th. The enemy troops in Guangdong also followed the West River into Guangxi, and Cangwu and Liuzhou successively fell. In December, the enemy in Guangxi took advantage of the victory to invade Guizhou, and on the 5th, captured Dushan. However, it was soon counterattacked and recovered by our army, and the enemy on the border of Guizhou was wiped out. The enemy's momentum of long-drive and direct entry was finally stopped.</p>
<h3>General He Jifeng Discusses the Lugou Bridge Incident</h3>
<p>Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Beiping on the 6th, Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei</p>
<p>General He Jifeng, currently the Deputy Commander of the 7th Pacification Zone of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, was the Commander of the 110th Brigade of the 29th Army at the time of the July 7th Incident, and personally commanded the Battle of Lugou Bridge. When the reporter visited Lugou Bridge on the 2nd of this month, I happened to meet General He at Wenyu Mountain. Mr. He was taking a walk at this old battlefield from nine years ago, the place where his old friend General Zhao Dengyu resisted the enemy. Mr. He recounted the details of the July 7th Incident as follows: Before the July 7th Incident, the 29th Army knew that the Japanese army was preparing for war very urgently, and that war was almost inevitable. Therefore, under the pretext of vacating barracks for students receiving military training, the 119th and 230th Regiments of Xiyuan were moved to the Lugou Bridge and Changxindian area. The Japanese army in Fengtai also used the pretext of exercises to reconnoiter the terrain in the Yongding River area. On July 5th, the Japanese army even passed through Wanping City and Lugou Bridge to the west of the river for exercises, and the defending army did not stop them. On July 6th, the Japanese army held exercises again. Our army had learned in advance that the Japanese army was carrying more bullets than usual this time, and must have had ulterior motives. Therefore, the gates of Wanping City were tightly closed, refusing them passage through the city. The Japanese army then turned back. However, in the evening, they again used the excuse that a soldier had been lost during the exercise yesterday, and requested to enter the city to search for him. Our army refused again. On the 7th, the Japanese army resolutely launched an invasion war. At dawn, the first battalion of the Mutaguchi Regiment approached Dajing Village, advanced towards Wanping and the Ping-Han Railway Bridge on the Yongding River in battle formation, and began shelling. After dawn, they approached Wanping City, and at 11 o'clock occupied the railway bridge. Both groups of defending soldiers died on the bridge. At 10 o'clock in the morning, our army rushed from Xiyuan to the brigade headquarters in Babaoshan and immediately issued three orders, ordering Regiment Commander Ji Xingwen to recapture the railway bridge before sunset. Regiment Commander Ji then selected a dare-to-die squad of 200 men to charge with broadswords, and finally completed the mission before sunset. The Japanese army left many corpses behind. Therefore, the enemy army proposed a truce on the 8th, which our side agreed to. The Japanese army then sent a military envoy with a white flag to transport more than a thousand corpses on the river bank, in the river, and on the bridge to Fengtai in large trucks. On the 9th, he went to Changxindian to pay respects to the fallen officers and soldiers. When he returned, guns and cannons were roaring east of the river. The Japanese army's formal offensive had already begun. Our side immediately added a regiment from Xiyuan. On the 10th, Dajing Village, Xiaojing Village, and Dawayao were recaptured. The Japanese army was discouraged. Therefore, on the 11th and 12th, they negotiated on one hand and transferred the Kawabe Brigade from Tianjin on the other hand. Our side also added six regiments, intending to recapture Fengtai. At noon on the 13th, the authorities in Beiping temporarily instructed that there should be no counterattack, so it was stopped. On the 15th, the enemy shelled Wanping again, and Ji Xingwen was wounded in the Longwang Temple, the regimental headquarters. On the 16th, Japanese Lieutenant General Tashiro personally supervised the battle, determined to capture Wanping. He was killed by our stray bullets at the Dajing Village station at noon. The Japanese claimed that Tashiro committed suicide by disembowelment. On the 12th, some houses in Wanping were set on fire by enemy shelling. In retaliation for Dajing Village, we shelled Yantai, but were then ordered to stop shelling. From the 17th to the 26th, there were only minor conflicts. On the 27th, the enemy attacked Nanyuan. We also planned to drive the enemy east of Lugou Bridge back and attacked Xiaojing Village. Soldiers climbed onto the roofs and fought enemy tanks, and captured Fengtai. The enemy retreated to the barracks. On the evening of the 28th, Tong and Zhao died in battle. The situation in Nanyuan was over. On the 29th, the defending army of Wanping City continued to defend for one day, covering the transfer of the main force to Mentougou. On the 30th, the mission was completed, and the defending army sadly abandoned Wanping and Lugou Bridge, which they had firmly defended for 24 days.</p>
<h3>A Historical Tragic Role Player: The Traitor Case</h3>
<p>A Statistic; Individual Punishment</p>
<p>With the arrival of victory, the work of eliminating traitors has been enthusiastically launched throughout the country. However, unable to withstand the washing away of time, these old wounds seem to have been gradually forgotten! To this day, there are quite a few reports, trials, and cases concerning enemy puppets. Settling years of blood debts in one fell swoop is truly a gratifying move. Here is a statistic of the past trials of traitors and enemy criminals, so that everyone knows the role of the players in this historical tragedy, which is expected by the people of the country. However, due to the long time, many involved, and the vast scope of enemy puppet activities, omissions in the record are inevitable.</p>
<p>Shanghai: Up to the end of June this year, Shanghai has already concluded 121 traitor cases involving 136 people. In addition, there are more fugitives, those being wanted, or under investigation, which are not within the scope of this article. Among the 121 cases that have been judged include: economic traitors Chen Riping, Li Ze, Tang Shoumin, Yuan Ludeng and other five people; cultural traitors Tao Kangde, Zhang Ke, Liu Yusheng, Gan Deyun and other four people; political traitors Hu Zewu, Liang Hongzhi, Liu Xingchen, Cai Meiyao, Xu Weizhen, Zhao Yutang, Liu Weijun, Zhang Deqin, Tang Huimin, Tang Liangli and other forty people; Yang Jichang, Zou Wenxian, Fang Zude, Wang Shiliang and other thirty-eight people who served as enemy constitutional officials and special agents; military and police traitors Zhao Riguang, Su Huaide, Shi Huiyao and other thirty-eight people; enemy-supporting merchants Chuan Guangyao, Hui Wenyuan, Xu Zuiren and other five people; Zhou Yi, Jiang Yougen, Zuo Ming, Cai Yunxi and other four people who recruited workers for the enemy. Among them, only the political traitor Liang Hongzhi was sentenced to death, while Chen Riping, Tang Shoumin, Yuan Ludeng, Yang Jichang and other fourteen people were sentenced to life imprisonment. The rest were all sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of less than fifteen years, and the lightest sentence was one year and three months. When the "Three Olds" Yuan, Wen, and Lin were tried, the gallery was packed, and some even had no seats.</p>
<p>Jiangsu: In early June, Sun Honglin, President of the Suzhou Higher Court, told reporters: Regarding traitor cases, the Higher Procuratorate received 1,906 traitor cases from January 34th year of the Republic to the end of May 35th year of the Republic. 804 cases have been submitted to the High Court for trial. 379 people have been finalized by the High Court, including 9 people sentenced to death, 22 people sentenced to life imprisonment, 197 people sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, 141 people acquitted, 10 people deemed inadmissible, and the remaining 425 people are still under trial. Among the nine people sentenced to death, in addition to the number one traitor Chen Gongbo, chairman of the puppet government, and Miao Bin, vice president of the puppet Legislative Yuan, who have already been executed, there are still seven people including Chu Minyi and Zhang Beisheng. The twenty-two people sentenced to life imprisonment include Chen Bijun, a member of the puppet Central Committee, Shen Wenjie, president of the puppet Jiangsu High Court, and Yu Lun, a traitor from Changshu. When the three major traitors Chen, Chu, and others were publicly tried in Suzhou, the entire city of Suzhou was in an uproar. Hotels and stations were crowded with distant guests from all over. They did not hesitate to travel long distances to see the true face of the contemporary traitors, which shows the eagerness of our people to punish traitors!</p>
<p>Nanjing: In the capital's "traitor trials," "ministers" in several puppet organizations, such as Mei Siping and Lin Bosheng, were sentenced to death. Li Shengwu's sentence was reduced to twelve years imprisonment due to his meritorious service in implementing an amnesty during his tenure as the puppet Minister of Judicial Administration. Yang Kuiyi, Ling _, and Hu Yukun, three military officers during the puppet government period, were all sentenced to death by the Military Law Department and were executed by firing squad in late June. It is worth noting that Wang Ni's second son, Wenti, who once served as a puppet lieutenant, was sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment with a five-year suspended sentence. The judge admonished him in court to "learn from your father's early life, do not learn from your father's later life, and start anew," which can be said to be meaningful.</p>
<p>Zhejiang: As of now, Zhejiang Province has concluded 43 traitor cases, including the president of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce Wang Wuquan, Hangzhou enemy constitutional secret agent Li Shihe, Zheng Yaochun and other three people sentenced to death; Zhang Juansheng, the false Zhejiang Minister of Civil Affairs and other three people sentenced to life imprisonment, the false Zhejiang Minister of Finance Lu Shanshi sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, the false Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Director Sun Xuelu sentenced to seven years imprisonment, and He Zhiping, editor-in-chief of the false Zhejiang Daily, is the first cultural traitor in Zhejiang Province to be sentenced to imprisonment, with a term of three years and six months.</p>
<p>Anhui: Wu Wuhu's traitorous merchant Wang Shancheng, during the enemy puppet period, searched for military grain for the enemy, taking advantage of his power and doing all kinds of evil, and was recently sentenced to death. The people of Anhui Province were very pleased. Xu Xiandao and Xu Wenbin, two major traitors from Anqing, were also sentenced to death. Chen Jibo, the "Magistrate of Hefei County," was sentenced to life imprisonment, Wang Pingbo, the "President of the Hefei Chamber of Commerce," was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, the "Jiashan Daily" editor was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Bao Zuoting, the "Chief of the Wuhu Police Bureau," was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment. In addition, many people, including the directors of various tax bureaus in Hefei and Qu Disheng, the deputy captain of the Fengyang Security Team, have been sentenced.</p>
<p>Hubei: According to a telegram from Hankou on the sixth of June: The Hubei High Court handled traitor cases in April of this year, including three death sentences, eleven life sentences, sixty-two fixed-term sentences, and thirty-eight acquittals. Shi Xingchuan, the puppet mayor of Hankou, and Zhang Yufang, the editor-in-chief of the puppet "Da Chu Bao," were both sentenced to death, making them the first cultural traitors to receive the heaviest sentences. Liu Yangran, the editor of the newspaper, was sentenced to six years, and the reporter Zhang Bingsan was sentenced to three years. Huang Dazhong, the puppet Hubei Provincial Education Director, Fang Zhongyuan, the puppet High Court Director, and Ouyang Honglie, a member of the puppet Provincial Party Committee, were all sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Guangdong: Guangdong Province once published a list of wanted traitors who were at large, totaling more than 200 people, which shows that traitors in Guangdong Province are mostly at large. However, once a trial is conducted and the crime is verified, the sentence is quite severe. Those that have been published in newspapers, such as Li Chaoqun, the president of the puppet Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Team, Tou Yingru, the puppet Minister of Civil Affairs, Luo Jun _, the president of the puppet Zhongshan Daily, and the female spy Huang Meili, were all sentenced to death. Huang Gongjie, the head of the enemy constitutional special service in Macau, who was once rampant, was shot and killed by guards while escaping from prison.</p>
<p>Fujian: From December of last year to the end of April this year, the Fujian High Court accepted 60 traitor cases and concluded 43 cases, including 16 imprisonment cases, 13 cases of fugitives being wanted, and the rest were all acquitted. Li Sibao, the puppet mayor of Xiamen, was sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Hebei: Hebei Province, including Pingjin, has concluded 18 traitor cases, among which the most noteworthy is the actor Li Wanchun, who was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for treason, and the cultural female traitor, Yin Meibo, the principal of Qingqing Girls' High School, was sentenced to five years imprisonment. As for Wang Kemin, the number one major traitor in North China, he has died of illness in prison. A group of other major traitors from the "North China Political Affairs Committee," due to the seriousness of their crimes, were transported from Beiping to the capital by plane in mid-June and are being tried one after another.</p>
<p>Shanxi: Among the traitors tried in Shanxi Province, eight people, including Li Yangwen, the puppet Magistrate of Fenxi County and the puppet Head of the Shanxi Anti-Communist Self-Defense Corps, were sentenced to death, Rong Furui was sentenced to life imprisonment, and five people were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment.</p>
<p>Qingdao: Yao Zuobin, the puppet mayor of Qingdao, and Xue Congzhi, the deputy commander of the security team, were both sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Guangxi: Zhou Weishan, a traitor in Guangxi Province, was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for treason and acting as a guide, and Wang Shigou was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for treason and supplying rice.</p>
<h3>Social Services: Answering Readers</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Wang Renshan asks: I have suffered from nasal congestion for several years. [Sometimes in the morning, it is slightly clear, and I can smell fragrances.] Upon closer inspection of the inside of the nasal cavity, there does not seem to be any polyp-like substances. When I try to breathe with my mouth closed, the air enters directly without obstruction when inhaling, but when exhaling, there is a bubble (about the size of a bean) that then swells and blocks the nasal passage. Please advise on how to treat this condition?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin]: I am afraid it is a nasal polyp. Please consult a nasal specialist to perform an excision.</p>
<p>(2) Chen Minggong asks: My father is fifty years old. Recently, he has suffered from a lump in his lower right abdomen that Traditional Chinese Medicine calls a "fish product" type of nodule, about the size of a chicken egg. It swells and hurts after labor, making it difficult to walk. When pressed firmly after sleeping at night, it descends and disappears, as if it were an air pocket. It reappears the next afternoon. This has been happening for three or four months. Initially, I took Amber Powder, but it was ineffective. There are no symptoms of chills or fever. I do not know what medicine can be used to treat it, and what dangers are there?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin]: I am afraid it is a inguinal hernia Herrua and must be diagnosed and treated by a surgical specialist. As for the risk, it depends on the condition.</p>
<p>(3) Wen Ding asks: I have suffered from tinea manuum for two or three years. It occurs every early winter and has not healed yet. The skin inside the palms is cracked, rough, and peeling. Even though I applied tinea manuum ointment, it was ineffective. Here are a few questions, and I hope you can answer them: (1) Is it possible that my hands will be numb in the future? (2) What medicine on the market can cure this condition completely? (3) What kind of doctor can treat this condition?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin]: (1) It is unlikely that your hands will be numb in the future. (2) There is no medicine that can cure this condition completely. You can try X-ray treatment. (3) Consult a dermatologist to treat this condition.</p>
<h3>Qingxia Elder's Orphan and Widow Relief Fund</h3>
<p>Seven applications, three approved</p>
<p>Since the news of the Qingxia Elder's relief for orphans, widows, and the poor and sick was published, the first batch of applicants included seven people. Among them, Shen Yaozong, Zheng Wen, Yulu, and Wu Yaozu did not meet the requirements because they had no shop guarantor or neighborhood head's certification. It was decided to postpone the decision. Yan Shi was approved for 100,000 yuan, Sha Xiumu was approved for 40,000 yuan, and Kong Xiangui was approved for 40,000 yuan. Please prepare a receipt with the original seals of the applicant, shop guarantor, and neighborhood head, and present it to our office for verification before receiving the money. Excerpts from the letters are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Applicant Yan Shi, from Wujin, is 73 years old. She lives at 19 Taipingfang, Kangding Road, in this city. Her husband died early, leaving behind a son named Zhong, who served in the military. During the early stages of the War of Resistance, he followed the national army to the west, fighting on the battlefield. He just returned to Shanghai this spring, but died of a serious illness due to the hardships of the journey. Mrs. Yan suffered this tragedy and was heartbroken. In addition, she is old and weak and unable to engage in production. She has no way to borrow money and her livelihood is worrying! I recently read in your newspaper that Qingxia Elder has generously helped orphans, widows, and the poor and sick. I dare to take the liberty to request relief in the letter, so as to avoid becoming a ghost in a foreign land. Then the elder's merit will be immeasurable (the shop guarantor and neighborhood head have both affixed their seals and the procedures are complete).</p>
<p>(2) Applicant Sha Xiumu, alone and destitute, is in dire straits. Moreover, he is too old to work. With the rising cost of living, the day when he will starve to death is not far away. I recently heard that Qingxia Elder has allocated funds to help orphans, widows, and the poor and sick. I was overjoyed and specially wrote a letter to apply for relief. If you agree, I will be very fortunate.</p>
<p>(3) To whom it may concern: There is a resident of the seventh household in this neighborhood, Kong Xiangui, from Tianjin, who works as a peddler. His family of three depends on it for a living. Recently, his wife contracted an epidemic. Kong spent all his capital, but she has not recovered. Moreover, since he is not engaged in production, the livelihood of the family of three is in jeopardy! The above are all true facts. I recently heard that Qingxia Elder has contributed funds to help the poor and relieve the widowed. I specially wrote a letter to apply for relief for Kong Xiangui, and I pray that you will approve it so that he can resume production. I am very grateful. Respectfully, Li Wenrong, Neighborhood Head of the Fourth District, Tenth Bao, Fourth Jia, Shanghai</p>

<h3>On National Painting</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Discussions on the principles and methods of painting are always monotonous; they are not only tiresome for the viewers and listeners but also for the speakers themselves; thus, those accustomed to discussing painting seem reluctant to do so, even unwilling. I have not written about painting for many years; now I will discuss it again. Here, I should propose a few points as an introduction:</p>
<p>First: We Chinese have painting!</p>
<p>Second: Our Chinese painting is like this!</p>
<p>Third: In the world, there are two types of painting: Western painting and Chinese painting!</p>
<p>Fourth: Foreigners also want to see Chinese national paintings!</p>
<p>Fifth: We Chinese should promote Chinese national paintings!</p>
<p>The first point expresses that we, a nation often considered inferior, actually have our own original painting. We have not simply adopted other people's painting as our own, and it has even been taken by others (Japan) as their own. This point seems to deserve a bit of self-praise!</p>
<p>The second point expresses that our Chinese painting has a history of thousands of years and has already established its form and status. Its strength and value should not be casually dismissed. It has a spiritual and personalized, surreal and supernatural advocacy, and its basic material is nourished by "reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles." Moreover, Western painting emphasizes biology, while our so-called landscape painting has not yet reached that point. Although there are landscape paintings such as plein-air sketches, they are merely a kind of imitation of nature and a depiction of work. Our landscape painting is indeed astonishing and noticed by the world's art scene, and it has progressed from the depiction of natural objects to the realm of "expressing the hills and valleys in the chest" and "creation in hand," and even to writing "unrestrained spirit in the chest" and cultivating breath.</p>
<p>A kind of painting that only has substantial skill, without breath and inspiration, cannot be called beautiful. Our national painting (landscape painting) possesses this!</p>
<p>The third point proves that our Chinese national painting and Western painting each hold the ear of the ox in the Eastern and Western hemispheres of the art world. It has its character, and I have my character. It represents the spirit and culture of the West, and I represent the spirit and culture of the East. To reiterate: our Chinese national painting especially represents the spirit and character of us Chinese because it is something produced in the spirit of our descendants of the Yellow Emperor.</p>
<p>The fourth point is that painting is a kind of cultural feature, like a flower: each flower has its color, fragrance, and form. However, the comparison of people to flowers is certainly not that simple, just as a person can immediately perceive the fragrance, color, and form of a flower. Whether a person can paint or not cannot be known unless they demonstrate it. In recent years, England and the United States have collected our national paintings for exhibition, which is an example of this; if you have any fragrance, you should let me smell it as well, and everyone should appreciate each other. This is an expression of friendly affection. At this time, we should all strive to produce some good works and exhibit them in friendly countries so that people know what kind of cultural nation we are.</p>
<p>The fifth point is that people of any country certainly do not necessarily only paint their own paintings, but can also paint paintings that are not their own; the goodness of art has no limit, and they are free to learn. However, to cultivate other people's fields and abandon one's own territory is to let down one's ancestors, descendants, and oneself. This is a very serious responsibility, and they should strive to learn and promote it. Passing on the torch from generation to generation, such as the brilliant era of the Song and Yuan dynasties, formed a "glorious" record in the history of civilization. How valuable it is, we should also step onto the path of our predecessors.</p>
<p>It seems like I have finished speaking, but thinking about it, there are still a few words to say. Recently, the supplements of various newspapers often publish comments or narrations on national paintings, some wanting to transform it, some wanting to maintain it, some wanting to abolish it, and some wanting to promote it. They are extremely enthusiastic, but just as a doctor cannot prescribe medicine without understanding the source and pathology of the disease, in this situation, the patient's anxiety is useless, and the doctor's anxiety is also useless. Someone watching a play says that the actors on stage are not performing well, and someone says why don't you go up and do it? The watcher cannot do it, but they can say whether it is good or not, which does not help the matter. It is easy to watch things but difficult to do them, which has always been the case. Our Chinese national painting: to tell the truth, it cannot be said that it is not promising now; it is certainly too early to say progress, but landscape painting is much better than it was twenty years ago. What kind of painting was it twenty years ago? It was the Little Four Wang school at the end of its rope; speaking of brushwork, the brush could not stand up; speaking of ink, the ink could not be dyed with ink color. The mountains were ash heaps, and the trees were broomsticks. You should know that national painting does not disregard likeness; its major premise is that drawing people should resemble people, and drawing mountains should resemble mountains; otherwise, there is no need to have the names of figures and landscapes. After likeness, then discuss other things, such as brush and ink, artistic conception, charm, and breath, all packed into it. If you draw mountains that resemble mountains but people that do not resemble people, a complete mess, even if you want to pack in the many things mentioned above, you cannot pack them in; even if you want to support it or protect it, even if it is literati painting or said to be unrestrained or divine, like Zhang Tianshi's talisman: it can exorcise ghosts, and people do not care what it looks like; this is a matter of function. Painting is not like that; it must ultimately resemble something. As for Su Dongpo's claim that "discussing painting based on likeness is the view of a child," it is a fragmentary and one-sided view. My meaning is that it is not appropriate to judge other people's paintings based only on likeness or solely on likeness; you should also add and consider other things (the several types mentioned above) in order to obtain a fair judgment. If you also view Dongpo's saying in this way, then Dongpo has been wronged by you; at the same time, you have misled the painting world. Therefore, the titles of divine, unrestrained, and literati paintings should be added on the basis of likeness, which is a complete and comprehensive criticism.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, my deceased friend Jiang Xiaoyu saw me writing about painting and said that you are a painter and should not also be a critic. In Europe, such as France, there are art theorists and artists; you should not violate this rule. I felt that it was not reasonable, and I protested, saying that someone without artistic cultivation and artistic practice experience would not know the "bitterness and sweetness of it," and would certainly "scratch an itch from outside the boot," like "a monk Zhang Er touching his head." The saying "It is difficult to know until you have experienced it" is absolutely correct! I firmly insisted that art theorists must be artists, and he had no choice but to let me do it. Unexpectedly, after I did it, social interactions became more and more busy day by day. Why? People who wanted me to write promotional articles said that your power is greater than ours in writing promotional articles; I asked them why, and they said because you are a painter! Later, after thinking about it carefully, I realized that I should not do this anymore because human relations are irresistible; if right and wrong are reversed and good and bad are not distinguished, how can I tolerate it? So I stopped writing such articles. After a long time, a good friend of mine said to me: Tianjian: You should not abandon your position as a critic because without power and position, you will be manipulated by others. I said I don't care about them; anyway, I will definitely not be affected by their good intentions; right and wrong are natural laws, and why should temporary praise or blame be important? If you value temporary popularity, then I am sorry, the powerful cannot lack your presence, and you cannot miss the lively scene. Business relationships and advertising expenses should be included in the capital, and you must use your mind and skills! However, if you are not careful, I am sorry, those who were in the limelight during the puppet regime will now have the label of colluding with the enemy and relying on power added to them! In fact, such people will definitely not be afraid because there are precedents such as Zhao Mengfu, Zhang Ruitu, and Wang Duo for them to follow, and it is just as valuable to curse them out as to praise them out, and it is easier to become famous by cursing than by praising! So an old friend laughed at me and said that you are still a fool; well, I am willing to be a fool for life. However, I will still write about the theory of painting, but I will never write articles that praise or curse people; I myself do not want to be in the limelight and overwhelm everything now. The titles of some great master or other, no matter what, I want to return them to Zhao. I have said too much, and I am about to go beyond the scope of the topic, but in fact, I am right in the center of the garden. You must know that the current environment and internal situation of national painting are related to what I have said above; the conclusion of this article is that critics should be faithful and wise in their criticism; if they do not understand, they should never interfere. The author themselves should honestly continue to study and stick to their position, and not care about everything else. Fulfill my duty. You must know that we Chinese have our own painting! People want to see yours!</p>
<h3>Famous Paintings and Famous Artists</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>One: The Pastoral Painter Millet and His Representative Works</p>
<p>Millet (Jean Francois Millet, 1814-1875) was a fiery general in the Barbizon school of French pastoral painters. He was the son of a farmer in a cold village near the Norman coast. He had a kind and capable grandmother who managed the entire household. His parents worked in the fields all day long, and Millet, like other farmers' sons, helped his parents in the fields every day; at the same time, he followed his parents in daily morning and evening prayers in the fields. His grandmother was also an old religious woman, so the paintings he had been accustomed to seeing since childhood were all religious propaganda paintings, and he used these paintings as models, repeatedly copying them. At the same time, a slate pencil and slate became his inseparable treasures. These actions slowly attracted the attention of his grandmother. So she said, "Francois has the qualities to succeed as a painter."</p>
<p>The name Francois in Millet's name was obtained by his grandmother from the church (derived from the name of the saint of Assisi, "Francis"). He also had an uncle who was a local missionary, who also discovered Millet's talent and believed that he must be educated. So he taught him Latin and taught him to read the Gospel of Mark, which he did not dislike and worked hard at. On days when it rained and he could not go out, he would scribble on the walls of the house, using the things he saw every day as subjects. One day, while walking on the road, he saw an old woman slowly walking towards him from afar, and he suddenly became very interested, hurriedly took a charcoal stick from his pocket, and quickly sketched the old woman's form on the wall. The villagers nearby were all shocked, and the old woman's expression was painted vividly, marveling at it as a miracle of the world! This news reached his father's ears, and he decided to send him to Paris.</p>
<p>In Paris, he entered the studio of the Romantic writer Delaroche. Because of his rural background, he inevitably suffered the ridicule and teasing of Parisian students upon arriving in the bustling capital, but his grades were outstanding, and he finally overcame his enemies and became a leader in the painting.</p>
<p>Soon, he held a wedding with a fellow villager, and to make a living, he made illustrations for various city magazines and painted nudes. He received a great deal of criticism, and after being stimulated by this, he resolutely left Paris and went to live in the village of Barbizon near Fontainebleau. So the man who came from the fields returned to the fields, and from then on, he devoted himself to depicting the scenes of the fields.</p>
<p>In 1849, Millet was thirty years old, and finally, "The Sower" was selected for the Paris Salon exhibition, attracting the attention of critics. The Parisian art world, which had always taken aristocratic life—wealth and glory—as its subject matter, suddenly discovered such a common painting, and naturally, not many people sympathized with it. Some even scolded him for being "vulgar," "low-class," and "ugly."</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Millet was not the first to depict pastoral scenes. As early as the seventeenth century, the Netherlands already had them. At that time, the subjects of the so-called pastoral paintings were really only to expose the ugliness and weaknesses of the peasants—laughing, eating a lot, being stupid, and being wild. Millet's works were different. He used skilled and delicate techniques to depict the daily faithful and tireless sacred work of the blue-white and amiable peasants, from scattering the seeds in the fields, sweating, and using their strength, finally obtaining the hard-earned harvest. "The Gleaners" and "The Angelus" are masterpieces after "The Sower." Although he suffered ridicule and sarcasm at the time, they have now become world-famous works.</p>
<p>In addition, works such as "The Woodcutter," "Evening Bell," and "The Reapers" are also his representative works, leaving a brilliant page in the history of art. "Art Going to the Countryside," Millet was the first and most successful one. He never painted a portrait of a celebrity in his life, nor did he act as an accomplice for the wealthy and powerful. Born in poverty, he left behind only a few pastoral paintings after his death.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>After finishing his cigarette, Shi Yulou stared blankly at the firefly-like light bulb, tears glistening in the gray gloom.</p>
<p>"Yulou, what's wrong with you? Are you not feeling well?" Madam Weng Er asked him in surprise, feeling uneasy in her heart.</p>
<p>"Nothing. Maybe I'm just tired," Shi Yulou said insincerely.</p>
<p>"Then you should rest and not exhaust yourself, so you can get better," Madam Weng Er said, tucking him in.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's time to rest!" Shi Yulou said meaningfully and secretly shed two tears.</p>
<p>Madam Weng Er did not realize the double meaning of Shi Yulou's words at the time. She went back to washing her clothes. After washing her clothes, she looked at Shi Yulou and saw no movement, only occasional coughs, so she thought that Shi Yulou was really tired and could not help but worry about his health. If she didn't let him sing anymore, they would have no way to make a living. "If Liyun were as successful as Lihua, wouldn't all the problems be solved?" Thinking of this, Madam Weng Er could not help but feel wronged for herself! She originally thought that marrying Shi Yulou would bring her a happy life, but who knew that everything would be so unsatisfactory. Madam Weng Er's fate could be considered bad enough! She had no more hope, only hoping that Shi Yulou's illness would get better soon. As long as Shi Yulou was by her side, she would be willing no matter how hard life was! She still loved Shi Yulou as much as she did in Jingzhou. Although she was old and Shi Yulou was old, her heart had not changed; in her eyes, Shi Yulou was still as beautiful as he was in those years!</p>
<p>However, Madam Weng Er's only hope was finally shattered again! The next morning, Madam Weng Er woke up and opened her eyes to see that Shi Yulou was no longer in bed. She hurriedly got up and went to Madam Mo's room and everywhere else to look for him, but there was no sign of Shi Yulou. So she panicked! Because Shi Yulou had never gotten up so early before, and thinking about the situation last night, she was even more panicked, and she had a premonition that the greatest misfortune was about to befall her!</p>
<p>Sure enough, it was not until the afternoon that someone found Shi Yulou in Beihai Park in the Central Park, but he had already closed his eyes. He had left this world in such a complaint and exhaustion, resting forever.</p>
<p>Madam Weng Er was going crazy! She hugged Shi Yulou's cold corpse and cried out and wept wildly!</p>
<p>This tragic scene deeply stimulated Lihua's soul! She seemed to feel that the dead person was not Shi Yulou, but herself—a future self! So she mourned for herself at the same time! Mourning for a future self who was learning from Shi Yulou's footsteps!</p>
<p>Madam Mo and Shi Yulou's colleagues were busy taking care of the affairs of this fallen actor. At this time, no one thought that on the same night, Madam Weng Er also followed Shi Yulou, using the money she had saved for washing clothes to buy two liang of opium to eat (she never dreamed that this opium paste, which she had originally planned to buy for Shi Yulou to relieve his cough, would be used as a tool for suicide). So Madam Mo and the others continued to take care of the second funeral.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou should have closed his eyes in peace! In this floating world, he finally felt that there was still a Madam Weng Er who had not abandoned him.</p>
<h3>Appreciation of Music</h3>
<p>— Song Shouchang</p>
<p>Among the sister arts, music has the most profound relationship with human life and the most universal relationship with the public. Everyone has the most direct instrument for expressing emotions—the voice. When the heart feels something, it can be expressed as a song and become music, unlike other arts that require materials and tools, making it troublesome to express emotions. Because music is directly expressed from the heart, its power to guide people is great and profound. In terms of the effect of music: it can regulate our fatigue, please our spirit, and increase the efficiency of our work. Music is indeed an essential nutrient for spiritual life.</p>
<p>Music art is loved by the public, almost everyone likes to listen to music, and everyone can sing, with the exception of special sensory cases. However, only a few can understand music. Just listen to the music that is generally sung, and you can know. These songs mostly lack variation in melody, simple rhythm, and rich harmony, such as ordinary ballads, movie songs, dance music, and marches. If they hear profound and mysterious music, they will feel tired and uninterested, which is clear evidence of a lack of musical literacy.</p>
<p>Then how can music be understood? This step requires cultivating the ability to appreciate it. Regardless of what kind of art, the appreciation aspect is very important. Music is deeply hidden in art, unlike other works of art that exist in space with shapes, colors, or words. Such as paintings, handicrafts can be seen. Poetry can be read. Music is connected by empty and broad sounds, is an abstract art. Appreciation depends entirely on our hearing and imagination, from the invisible to appreciate its interest, so appreciating music is more difficult than appreciating other works of art, and understanding music is even more difficult.</p>
<p>Appreciating music is not just about using our senses. We hear pleasant tones and have a sense of pleasure, which is just the sensory beauty of music. Just like we see the beauty of nature and feel happy. Music is a product of reason, and emphasizes the beauty of musical structure. In addition to sensory appreciation, we must further appreciate and use our reason to study the structure and form of the music, so that we can taste more profound interest.</p>
<p>Although music is a direct expression of emotion, it uses various sounds that suggest emotions to guide people's hearts and arouse feelings of joy or sadness. Therefore, in order to appreciate music, in addition to the beauty of feeling and the beauty of reason, in order to obtain the effect of appreciating music, we must appreciate the emotion of music. Use the foundation of reason. Cultivate a rich memory, and use a keen imagination to understand. We must understand the emotion of the music and explore the personality and environment of the author.</p>
<p>In summary: appreciating music requires feeling, rational, and emotional, to appreciate music you must prepare the ability to appreciate music, which needs to be gradually cultivated through considerable time of training.</p>

<h3>Chinese Agricultural Tools and Machinery (2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhong Deqi</p>
<p>According to accurate statistics, the cost of using agricultural tools and machinery in the United States is 20% of the value of the tools. Interest rates on capital in China are also much higher than in the United States, and the tools are not as durable. The investment interest rate for agricultural tools in China calculated above is 20%, which is slightly lower than the current interest rates in various places. In short, the average cost per mu of agricultural tools is affected by the number of mu worked.</p>
<p>A practical and simple method for calculating the cost of using agricultural tools is to multiply the market price of the tools by the production loan interest rate. The depreciation rate of agricultural tools can be calculated as the reciprocal of the tool's lifespan in years. For example, if the lifespan is 20 years, then the annual depreciation rate is 5%. Add to this the total annual repair and operating costs (such as oil) to obtain the usage cost. When the investment interest, depreciation costs, and operating costs are added together, the result is the cost of using the agricultural tools. The cost per crop mu can be obtained by dividing the total cost by the number of crop mu. (Table 1) If an agricultural tool is rented or borrowed, it must be calculated separately.</p>
<p>(Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>Estimated value of agricultural tools (27.70 yuan) 5.54</p>
<p>Depreciation (5%) 2.40</p>
<p>Operating costs (including repairs) 3.45</p>
<p>Total operating cost of agricultural tools per farm 11.39</p>
<p>Operating cost of agricultural tools per crop mu 0.365 (11.39 yuan divided by 31.2 crop mu)</p>
<p>Estimated value of agricultural tools per crop mu 0.89 (27.70 yuan divided by 31.2 crop mu)</p>
<p>Percentage of total operating cost of agricultural tools to the estimated value of agricultural tools 41 (0.365 yuan divided by 0.89 yuan)</p>
<p>Table 1. Average annual cost of using agricultural tools per farm in the Central and Eastern Provinces of China in 1935 (Note 1)</p>
<p>This method can be used to compare the costs of using various different agricultural tools and machinery. The total cost of any farm operation can be obtained. For example, for plowing, it is necessary to add the cost of labor and power (draft animals or machinery). A comparative study of operating the same operation with various different agricultural tools in China can reveal the relationship between the cost and profit of each tool. In 1935, the cost of hoeing per mu was 0.26 yuan, while using a tractor was only 0.07 yuan. The cost of harvesting per mu with a sickle was 0.192 yuan, while using a [threshing machine, likely] was only 0.06 yuan.</p>
<p>New-style Machinery</p>
<p>The following comparative calculations were made on a farm near Nanjing: using a water buffalo to pull a plow and using a tractor; using [hand flails, likely] to thresh and using a threshing machine (Table 2). According to these results, the cost of the tractor was more than twice that of the water buffalo. If the tractor tilled the soil better and produced a larger yield, then the labor cost increased due to the increased production should be deducted from the estimated cost of the tractor.</p>

<p>Half the cost of plows and tractors 13.00</p>
<p>Total 689.20 (yuan)</p>
<p>Average cost per mu for 900 mu 0.75 (yuan)</p>
<p>Average cost per acre for 150 acres 4.59 (yuan) or (1.37 US dollars)</p>
<p>Comparing threshing machines with tractors, although the former can only be used for 15 days a year, vegetable oil in China is more cost-effective than tractors. The results of using a small threshing machine at Jinling University show that it is as economical as using a sickle and obtains pure products. The cost per 23 and one-third pounds is 0.54 yuan, which is close to the 0.55 yuan for a sickle. However, another difficulty in using new machinery is that the straw is not as stiff as that cut with a sickle, making it unsuitable for roofing. In southern China, there must also be roads that can move the threshing machine (translator's note: the fields in the south are narrow). However, the threshing machine can save time during the busy farming season and can combine the threshing and harvesting operations into one, thereby saving labor in addition to harvesting and reducing grain loss.</p>
<p>In irrigated areas downstream of the Yangtze River, the introduction of irrigation machines is a successful example of the use of new agricultural tools. Rice requires a lot of water, so in areas far from water, manual irrigation is not enough.</p>
<p>The possibility of introducing modern agricultural machinery is based not only on economic principles but also on the arrangement of the farm. If the fields are too small and irregular, and the roads are too narrow, the machinery cannot be used advantageously. It is possible to expand farms if arable land is reorganized or re-zoned. Recently, the United States has reduced the size of machinery. If its price can be reduced significantly, some machinery may be usable in China. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>The following issues should be discussed in terms of production organizations: factory buildings, personnel, raw materials, manufacturing, and transportation. The point about factory buildings has already been discussed above, and now it may be worthwhile to discuss the other points in turn.</p>
<p>Personnel</p>
<p>The personnel referred to here is limited to the allocation of personnel, not personnel management, because personnel management will be discussed in detail after the production organization.</p>
<p>From the time we initiate to the establishment of the company and the construction of the factory building, the allocation of important staff should also be arranged properly. No matter what the matter, it is to be done by people, so the allocation of personnel has a great relationship with the success or failure of the business.</p>
<p>The allocation of personnel referred to here is discussed from the standpoint of production. Ordinary businesses do not have production work. The organization is relatively simple. Under a manager, there are several departments such as purchasing, sales, and accounting, which can handle daily affairs very smoothly.</p>
<p>The greatest purpose of personnel allocation is to clarify the responsibilities of each person, and the second is to make the work proceed smoothly. With an organization, a budget can be prepared by each department.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, the main parts of a company are nothing more than production, sales, and business. Now it may be worthwhile to discuss these aspects:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the management part: Under normal circumstances, the highest officer of a company is the general manager (in a limited liability company, then the highest level in the form is the shareholders' meeting, below which is the board of directors, and below which is the general manager. The general manager is sometimes concurrently held by the chairman of the board, the managing director, or a director. If there is only one person, then there is no need to use the title of general manager, but the title of manager).</p>

<h3>Where Did the Rice Go?</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>I ran all over seven or eight rice shops on North Sichuan Road and couldn't buy a dou of rice. We have never encountered such an embarrassing situation, even in the rear during the War of Resistance. What kind of world is this? What kind of vampires, what kind of demons are at work?</p>
<p>The grain loan case has gradually subsided, and we want to pursue its sequel. Before the truth comes out, it seems that Shanghai has become a city without rice. It is obvious that someone is manipulating this, showing their "colors."</p>
<p>The newspapers publish every day that thousands of dan have arrived, and thousands of dan have been allocated. What Annam rice, Brazil rice, Jiangxi brown rice, God knows, I ran seven or eight rice shops, and I didn't buy a single grain.</p>
<p>Every rice shop is open, and the clerks are smoking and enjoying the street scene, while the rice bags and rice cabinets are empty.</p>
<p>"Isn't there allocated rice to be sold to you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"We applied four or five days ago, and it hasn't been allocated yet," the clerk replied.</p>
<p>"Hey! I don't care about the price, you say it."</p>
<p>"Sir, there really isn't any. If there were, why wouldn't we sell it?"</p>
<p>"Then what are you opening the door for!" I was a little angry.</p>
<p>"If we don't open the door, our license will be revoked. We can't help it!"</p>
<p>"Hey, where can I buy it, friend, please help me!"</p>
<p>"Tianhougong Bridge, Zilaihuo Street, Qiujiang Road, there are porters, there are stalls, they are all selling."</p>
<p>Another clerk smiled triumphantly and then said: "Rice shops are also playing guerrilla warfare."</p>
<p>The above is an account of my rice buying experience yesterday. I faithfully record it here. I believe this is definitely not a situation that I have encountered alone.</p>
<h3>The First Time</h3>
<p>— Denghui</p>
<p>"The First Time" is the name of a demon. Since mankind has had "unease" in their "conscience," it has quietly descended into the world. When "The First Time" had not yet come, mankind's "conscience" was as calm as the water in an ancient well; therefore, mankind was confused—did "The First Time" bring the unease of conscience? Or did the unease of conscience bring "The First Time"? This question is as inexplicable as whether the chicken came first or the egg.</p>
<p>In principle, it is now the atomic age! A demon like "The First Time" should have disappeared upon hearing about the atom. However, no, "The First Time" has laid such a solid foundation in the conscience of mankind. Its tricks have made the conscience of mankind change from hating it to sympathizing with it, from disliking it to understanding it.</p>
<p>Now, the network of influence of "The First Time" has spread throughout the entire human world. What kind of face has this world been made into by "The First Time"! Look!</p>
<p>Someone is using violent hands to defile a young girl. The girl can't struggle, and her virginity is destroyed! For him, it's the first time.</p>
<p>Someone is using a third hand to reach into other people's bags, drawers, safes... the first time.</p>
<p>Someone is openly taking weapons and moving your property away in a grand manner.</p>
<p>Someone's family has only six people, but they have more than a hundred dan of white rice piled up at home, and there's more! There's more in the warehouse!</p>
<p>Someone's speculation failed, but the gold bars increased by dozens.</p>
<p>Enough! Enough! I'm just picking these little things to prove the relationship between "The First Time" and human conscience!</p>
<p>When these people, who have been demonized by "The First Time" and whose consciences are uneasy, when their unease is confirmed and made public, listen to what they say: "Please forgive me for 'The First Time'! I really committed it for 'The First Time'!" So, people buy the ghostly face of "The First Time" and do a "consideration of the first offense due to ignorance, and leniency in sentencing." Or even think it's innocent, and just scold them verbally: "No matter what, you can't be fooled by 'The Second Time'!" So, those uneasy consciences calm down again; and "The First Time" becomes even more rampant!</p>
<p>Let me simply reveal the ambition of "The First Time"! It adopts a kind of "offensive strategy," a "demonization policy"! It wants to turn the conscience of the entire human race into the evil heart of a demon, it wants to turn the entire human world into a demon's world!</p>
<p>Most of the human world has been changed from its original appearance of truth, goodness, and beauty. If this continues, what is the future destiny of mankind? You think about it!</p>
<p>Putting aside your own generation and saying: "Would you want your children and grandchildren to live in a desolate, dark, terrifying, and cruel demon world?"</p>
<p>"Good words of persuasion" can no longer save the crisis of this era!</p>
<p>"Knowing one's mistakes and correcting them" is simply a luxury for these people who have been demonized by "The First Time"!</p>
<p>Warn all just people in the world! We must never forgive the demon "The First Time" again! We must mercilessly eliminate the "consciences" that do evil in the name of "The First Time"! At the same time, you—one of mankind—must more actively prevent "The First Time" from sneaking into your precious and innocent heart!</p>
<h3>Starting from Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongxun</p>
<p>The earliest relief supplies seen in the newspapers were raisins and jackfruit. The relief supply that has recently become famous in the newspaper is milk powder. There is no relief rice among them, probably because the United States does not produce rice? I seem to have heard of flour, but in reality, milk powder has taken the lead.</p>
<p>Raisins, jackfruit, and milk powder are all top-quality items; the relief authorities must have put a lot of thought into providing relief to us. They intentionally want to raise the living standards of the Chinese people and make us truly one of the four great powers.</p>
<p>Relief and dumping cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Dumping is low-priced sales. Therefore, after Carnation milk powder was dumped, Huimin milk powder withdrew from the market and went into seclusion. But relief doesn't cost a penny. Dumped goods can defeat domestic products, and since relief goods don't cost a penny, they will definitely defeat dumped goods. As for the relationship between relief goods and domestic products? I feel a little confused for a moment.</p>
<p>The US Department of Commerce budgets US$2.5 billion annually for export advertising. I wonder when American advertising goods will come to China? Have they already come? However, relief goods should not be advertising goods, right? If compatriots don't understand very well, they can only ask our benefactor.</p>
<p>Milk powder is a relief item, and tofu soy milk is a domestic product. As the saying goes, "It can only relieve the emergency, but not poverty." It can be seen that relief items are not permanent. If we have already become addicted to milk powder before the relief stops, then after the relief stops, will we still eat dumped milk powder, or will we eat domestic tofu soy milk? I don't think we will be able to eat tofu soy milk. First, the tofu shop has already changed its business to a milk powder distributor, and second, once we are used to eating milk powder, we won't be used to eating tofu soy milk.</p>
<p>I think it's best to refuse to eat milk powder now and continue to eat tofu soy milk, because once you get addicted to milk powder, and the milk powder is no longer dumped and the supply is cut off, you will be forced to Liangshan Mountain and eat stockpiled goods.</p>
<p>Good heavens, the topic is relief supplies, but I have written about stockpiled goods. Isn't that irrelevant and inhumane!</p>
<h3>What I Saw in the Park</h3>
<p>— Chimo</p>
<p>Going to the park to sit or walk is best done in the morning, but I say morning not because the air is fresh in the morning, but because there are special close-up shots to be seen everywhere in the park in the morning. If this time has passed, then everything in the park seems plain, and all the flowers and trees are as silent as chairs. Therefore, the park in the morning is full of vigorous vitality, so my time to go to the park is set in the morning.</p>
<p>The rules and regulations at the entrance of the park clearly prohibit kicking a ball in the park. I remember that in the days of the patrol room, when the patrolman saw a tourist carrying a ball, he would confiscate it without asking if you were going to kick it. Now, it is said to be democracy, so it can't be forbidden. Therefore, small soccer balls are kicked to large soccer balls, and there are also people playing badminton. If some children are unlucky, they will be hit by stray "balls." Of course, their noses and eyes will be swollen, and sometimes they will even bleed on the spot. In the period when "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed in," this kind of unfortunate event never happened.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are more and more unemployed actors and singers every day. They can't sing in harmony, so they have fled to the park, taking in a group of apprentices, and the money for room and board is also settled. In the past, there was only one group that danced knives and clubs in the park (taking Gujiazhai Park as an example) every morning, but now, a large group of people is gathered around watching fist fights, and there is also a large circle watching single spears breaking double knives in the west, and there is also one in the south, and also one in the north, there is one over there, and there is also one over here, there are probably many, and there are both men and women. The audience is surrounded by people, and some people even climb trees and watch from a high position. When each program is finished, the audience is very polite and always applauds for a while.</p>

<h3>The Three-Person Conference Is Too Serious</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>During the three-person conference, everyone sat around a very ordinary long table. Marshall sat in the center, the government representative sat on the right, and the CCP representative sat on the left. It seems to give us a very clear concept that one side is "left" and one side is "right," while Marshall is neither left nor right.</p>
<p>Every time the conference is held, Marshall never prepares a "political banquet." He doesn't wait until the conference is over, and everyone eats their own meal. Therefore, some people suspect that this is one of the factors that make it difficult to talk well. Because Chinese people are most likely to have a very speculative conversation while eating; if it is possible to use finger-guessing games to help liven things up in the "political banquet," and everyone extends their thumbs and shouts loudly "Good brothers," you guess how energetic this is. Maybe the two brothers will really get along from then on! But, unfortunately; Marshall is an American after all, and he doesn't understand the art of Chinese people eating. Three or two glasses of Shaoxing wine and two shouts of "Good brothers" often have wonderful uses beyond the conference.</p>
<p>So that's what I think: If Marshall really came up with a table of "reunion wine," brought two bottles of whiskey to cheer things up, and brought a few glasses of Shaoxing wine to moisten his throat, and had Marshall set up a "general pass," and everyone shouted with all their might a few times of "Family Happiness" and "Good Brothers," and then had Shao Lizi or Wang Shijie and Zhou Enlai come for a "grab three," and everyone made the sound as loud as possible, taking the opportunity to let out a breath of suffocation, and Marshall at this time—after three rounds of wine, if he shouted out another "Good Brothers," I believe everyone would definitely not put on a cold face and say sarcastic things. Maybe everyone will really get along from then on, then wouldn't you and I, the little common people, be "blessed as a family"!</p>
<p>Finally, my "idea" is that Marshall should also change his style. Only eating some "sand leak water" during the conference not only cannot raise interest, but also really becomes "cold in the heart."</p>
<h3>Words of a Drinker</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>My friends all advise me to quit drinking.</p>
<p>They all say: A person who makes a living solely from medicine pots and tea stoves, yet cannot give up alcohol, is no different from committing slow suicide.</p>
<p>Suicide, I don't have that kind of courage. If I did, I would have committed suicide more than a decade ago, why wait until today? I know alcohol can harm life, but alcohol has been my friend for over twenty years, yet it hasn't demonstrably harmed my life. On the contrary, when I am without alcohol, I find life sad; once I have a glass in my hand, I feel light and carefree, seeing vitality and joy everywhere. Even when I'm full of sorrow, and "raising a glass to drown my sorrows only increases them," I can still see meaning in life through the glass, and it's not just a gray haze like it is when I haven't been drinking.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've discovered that alcohol doesn't give me something like the commonly perceived toxin, but rather a pure stimulant for life; it can inspire me to be a person, and encourage me to struggle for life. It pulls me out of depression, sends me much warmth from the cold, and gives me a glimpse into the diversity of life, and that the world is a multifaceted and complex place. The world, to put it on a small scale, is a chessboard, and countries and nations are the chess pieces vying on the board. The struggle of the chess pieces is governed, and being governed means there will be victory and defeat, survival and extinction. However, through drowsy, drunken eyes, it truly is multifaceted and complex! Only in the drowsy, drunken eyes does one come to understand the truth of it. Over the years, I've received a lot of help from alcohol.</p>
<p>Who says alcohol "harms life?"</p>
<p>But alcohol makes people take risks, risks to the point where they are not afraid of death. This is probably what is meant by "harming life!" However, that is not the original intention of alcohol! It just wants people to see that the dangers before them are not dangers at all. Therefore, proving it from this perspective, it can indeed lead you to overcome crises and save your life from them. That's my understanding.</p>
<p>However, alcohol sometimes brings me a bit of annoyance, because it gives me too much courage, making me too reckless; being too reckless leads to regret, but that only comes after waking up. If one is still in a drunken stupor, that regret will never truly become regret.</p>
<p>Alcohol gives a person a sense that his life is not dangerous, but an adventure; this is why alcohol is so endearing.</p>
<p>When I first started drinking, I always adhered to the precept of "unlimited alcohol, but not to the point of chaos." I would drink a pound or half a pound until my face turned like a pig's liver, and then happily ponder the true meaning of life, and consider myself satisfied. Later, it wasn't that my alcohol tolerance had reached its limit, but that my personality gradually became much more unrestrained, so a pound or half a pound was no longer enough to satisfy me. Thus, the taste of life I experienced from alcohol became even deeper. Sometimes, unable to restrain myself, I would use alcohol to scold the audience.</p>
<p>Scolding the audience is indeed a delightful thing! "Truth comes out after drinking," the person being scolded always has something to be scolded for, and it's something that must be scolded. Only then can I thoroughly and completely scold to my heart's content "after drinking." However, this is always where I offend people, if the person being scolded doesn't reflect on themselves. Later, I accepted my friends' advice and gave up much of this, but the amount of alcohol I drank still increased, and this was by no means due to a large capacity, but because I wanted to drink more.</p>
<p>To drink more means to get drunk. Only when drunk is life truly lived.</p>
<p>However, this only applies to Shaoxing wine. When I moved to Hong Kong, I didn't dare to drink a pound at a time. This is because double-distilled liquor isn't as mild as rice wine, and double-distilled liquor tastes spicy when it enters the mouth.</p>
<p>Some people describe drinking double-distilled liquor as "swallowing razor blades," but I never acknowledge that it "harms life."</p>
<p>However, drinking double-distilled liquor to the point of drunkenness means it takes more than half a day to wake up, and after waking up, one always wears a deathly pale face. Since I'm often sick, wearing this deathly pale face makes me even more frightening.</p>
<p>Because it's frightening, my friends often advise me to quit drinking.</p>
<p>Quitting drinking isn't difficult, but after quitting drinking, the pleasure of life will also disappear, at least for me, that's how it is.</p>
<p>However, how can I betray the good intentions of my friends? In the past month or so, I've accepted my friends' advice and put quitting drinking into practice.</p>
<p>After I quit drinking, my wife immediately unfurled her perpetually furrowed brow, because, in the midst of "poverty-stricken couples experiencing grief in everything," she had one less alcohol expense to arrange for each day.</p>
<p>But I feel a sense of emptiness in everything, in this past month or so, after quitting drinking.</p>
<h3>Poems of an Eastern Journey</h3>
<p>— Gu Yiqiao</p>
<p>Difficult to hold Yokosuka by quietly sneaking in,</p>
<p>To jump into the sea and burn the body is also futile;</p>
<p>The divine wind of September cannot reach,</p>
<p>The surrender ship is docked in Tokyo Bay. (Yokosuka Port)</p>
<p>The bleak wind and snow over Etajima,</p>
<p>The Japanese dwarfs who buried in the sea lost their hegemonic ambitions;</p>
<p>I do not believe the Qin King ever sent envoys,</p>
<p>The port of Kansai sealed Wu long ago. (Kure Port)</p>
<p>A hundred years of deluded dreams, revealing military uniforms,</p>
<p>Hiroshima became ruins in a single bomb blast;</p>
<p>The country is broken, the family is dead, the ruler is humiliated,</p>
<p>Red faces and white hair depend on each other after the disaster. (Hiroshima)</p>
<p>Not yet ascended to the Empathy Pavilion,</p>
<p>Kobe happily gazes upon the writings of the Father of the Nation;</p>
<p>Waiting to visit the surviving elders on the seashore,</p>
<p>The night tide has already reported the waxing and waning of the moon. (Kobe)</p>
<p>Osaka's heroic posture remains in the ancient fortress,</p>
<p>Exhausting soldiers and destroying armor, nothing remains;</p>
<p>Pitifully, in the ashes after the disaster,</p>
<p>The spring rain still reports the souls of those who died later. (Osaka)</p>
<p>Where does the spiritual light shine at Magu?</p>
<p>The Kiyomizu Temple is a secluded old imperial capital;</p>
<p>Occasionally a guest on the shores of Lake Biwa,</p>
<p>The price of paper in Luoyang will soar in the Immortal Assembly Picture. (Kyoto)</p>
<p>The Imperial Garden and Shrine are not to be visited,</p>
<p>The verdant pines and cypresses are leisurely and long;</p>
<p>Still the top of Mount Fuji is white,</p>
<p>A returning boat in the wind and rain, a seagull on the sea. (Tokyo)</p>
<h3>Glass Battleship</h3>
<p>— Zou Shangchang</p>
<p>The road is bustling with noise, with groups of people here and there, all whispering and discussing. It is said that an American glass battleship will come to Shanghai this afternoon.</p>
<p>Although it is a very hot day, with a fiery sun high in the sky, the Huangpu River is crowded with people, all there to see the American glass battleship. Everyone is waiting patiently, and two or three hours pass. The battleship still doesn't even show a shadow. Suddenly, someone yells, "The glass battleship is here! The glass battleship is here!" Then, millions of eyes all look towards the river. Those in the back who can't see lift their feet and stretch their necks to look at the river. All that can be seen is a great wind blowing in the river, making it impossible for those on the shore to open their eyes. The wind and waves are strong, creating a truly overwhelming momentum. Before long, the wind subsides, the waves calm, and the smoke and clouds dissipate. The people of Shanghai have added another legend. In the end, the glass battleship has come after all.</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai are, as always, sensitive.</p>
<h3>The Suitor</h3>
<p>— Zhang Tianyou</p>
<p>A young artist presents his masterpiece to her, and at the same time proposes marriage. She says, "Love requires money. May I ask, how many American dollars can an artist earn in a month?"</p>
<p>A handsome engineer shows her a blueprint of a garden residence he recently created, and at the same time proposes marriage. She says, "Indeed, this blueprint is designed very appropriately. However, can you afford to build such a magnificent Western-style house?"</p>
<h3>Three Words and Two Sentences Collection</h3>
<h3>The Mystery of Rice?</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>The Huangpu District police alarm has been installed. Some say that from now on, the Huangpu District police should forget about catching any robbers. The reasoning is very simple: after the installation of the alarm, aren't the robbers all scared away?</p>
<p>Or it is said that playing poker requires patience, while at the same time requiring ruthless hands and a hard heart. If you can cheat, you should cheat. If the wind changes, it is better to shrink back. In short, you need to adapt to all sorts of changes and be on guard at all times. Therefore, those who are inexperienced in the world should not enter the game. On the other hand, those who are skilled in this way must already be rich in worldly experience. However, adapting to circumstances is indeed a necessary condition for living in the world. As for success or failure, it all depends on fate. If fate is not on your side, all efforts are in vain.</p>
<p>"Secrets should not be told to those who love to drink." This saying is not necessarily reliable. Haven't many of the traitors who were recently tried leaked the secret of "communicating with the central government" in court? I don't believe that all these traitors are drunkards.</p>
<p>The Father of the Nation died in Gu Weijun's residence in Beiping. There was a white marble stone monument inlaid on the wall with the inscription in gold lettering. Before the Japanese invasion, an old man who was guarding the house plastered it over with whitewash, so it remained intact. The old man's whereabouts are now unknown. It is a pity that Chu Minyi did not know about this, otherwise, he could have used it to present to the court as a reason to request a reduced sentence, which would have been a much stronger piece of evidence than the non-existent "preserving the Prime Minister's..."</p>
<p>Not being able to buy rice at home, a colleague said this was not true. The rice shops are full of rice, they just don't want to sell it. However, when I went back the next day, I actually investigated all the nearby rice shops. Apart from the shop assistants eating a large pot of cooked rice for dinner, I truly couldn't see a single grain of rice in the rice buckets. This proves that what my colleague said was the truth, and that the rice merchants were deceiving me.</p>
