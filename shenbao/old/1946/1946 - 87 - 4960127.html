<h3>軍事三人會發布命令　派遣小組前往東北　政治問題將另行商決</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕周恩來返渝後，軍事三人小組經再度磋商，已決定派遣執行小組前往東北，並於今日電北平執行部預爲準備各小組人選，執行部為此事整日舉行會議，記者向各方探悉，執行部除接到如上之指示外，尙未奉到更爲詳細而具體之原則。據關係方面表示，若干解決東北問題之原則，當已由渝軍事三人小組商定或商討中，東北執行小組，將就此項原則予以執行。派往東北小組之權力，一如派往華北各地者，負就地解決問題之責，而非僅負調查搜休材料責任。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕三人會議於馬歇爾將軍返美前曾商得同意，於最近期內即派遣執行小組前赴東北，為達成此事，政府代表張治中將軍。中共代表周恩來將軍及馬歇爾將軍之代表吉倫將軍繼續商談，現已獲致協議，其對軍調部即派遣執行小組前赴東北發布之指令如左：由精選人員所組成這執行小組，應即派往東北執行下列諸指示：（一）小組之任務，僅限於軍事調處工作，（二）小組應在政府軍隊及中共軍隊地區工作，並避免進入仍爲蘇軍駐留之地區，（三）小組應前往衝突地點或政府軍及中共軍密接地點，使其停止衝突，並作必要及公平之調處。各方另同意關於東北軍事問題由三人會議繼續商談，關於政治問題另行商談，迅求解決。</p>
<p>〔美新聞處北平廿七日電〕調處執行部派遣執行小組赴東北事，此間調執部亦已發表公報，如氣候良好，執行小組將於星期五出發，工作地點尙未宜布。關於遣赴東北之執行小組任務，日內將發表更詳細之報告，赴東北之美方人員業已決定，計有前在赤峯工作之第二執行小組主任道鐵洛德上校·古萊上校·戴文伯上校·巴伯勒上校·譚力克上校及前在張家口工作之第五執行小組主任阿爾巴馬。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿七日電〕制止東北衝突之執行小組派往地點，一般人猜想，或將前往瀋陽·長春·營口等處及東北及熱河邊境。據稱，共軍曾經由該處增援東北。</p>
<h3>淮陰小組抵海門視察　下月初轉赴蘇北　華北交通郵政府待努力恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕軍息：軍調部淮陰小組美代表鄧克中校，政府代表蕭鳳岐，共黨代表韓念龍，今日已到達海門，視察距城的六十華里之靈甸渭附近衝突區雙方駐軍實際情况，如不須赴啓東調査，下月初期可轉往揚州·泰縣·邵伯·秦潼等地工作。現揚泰各地國軍廿五軍部隊長曁當地政府已準備歡迎，蘇北各縣旅鎭士紳，昨起已紛赴揚州鵠候。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕鎭江訊：軍調部淮陰小組，在南通成立之四項協議，其中第三項關於共軍佔領區內通用法幣一事極重要，因蘇北共軍在其佔領區內强迫人民行使抗幣，且將法幣價値抑低至每元抗幣掉換三十三至三十五元法幣之等値，並割裂郵權，擅自印行郵票，復以種種苛刻，限制阻塞蘇北商民通匯，幾使蘇北十五縣旅外從事各種工作人員之家屬坐以待斃。蘇北各縣負笈京滬鎭揚各地之校生，因斷絕接濟，已大多失學，淪爲流浪之孤兒。現蘇北旅鎭人士熟望淮陰小組督促共軍，忠實履行通用法幣之諾言，並望對「統一郵權」「開放匯兌」二事，從速成立切實易行之協議。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕執行部對恢復交通表示樂觀之背面，實尙有若干困難存在其間。今日某交通界人士坦白向記者指陳，恢復交通工作，猶須各方開誠相見，盡其最大努力。以言月來恢復交通成績，自執行部第四號命令發表後，除津浦北段馮家口至泊頭一小段修復外，平津區所轄其他各縣，尙無所成。電信方面，已修復千四百餘公里，尙有千五百餘公里，因開工受阻，未能搶修。郵政方面，亦未恢復正常狀態。執行部政府代表，前曾根據停戰協定，對恢復郵政常態，提出數項原則，即人事統一，管理統一，不准另外發行郵票，恢復原有郵路，中共代表對此尙無答覆。又中共方面近對其控制區內修復鐵路工作頗爲積極，平綏綫自動向靑龍橋方而修築，膠濟綫自動由張店向東木搶修，交通界人士推測，中共此舉，在獲得共同管理權。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿七日電〕據悉，執行部鐵道管理科所派高密小組，工作迄無進展。該科政府科長陳麓，中共科長耿彪及美方科長希爾，決定倘廿八日天氣轉佳，將乘專機偕飛靑島轉高密視察，並予以實地指示。俾得復路工作順利進行。又據濟南方面消息，膠濟綫修築張店以東至辛店時，共軍出而阻止，修路工程已停頓。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據石家莊方面消息，修路勘査隊，行至高邑被阻不能前進，聞高邑以北係屬中共冀南軍區，以南則屬太行軍區，該隊均一再從高邑退回元氏，另候交涉，至元氏，至高邑間路綫，日內可望開工。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原廿六日電〕軍調部太原小組到達來遠後，廿五日召集雙方當地軍事首長開會，已商定停止衝突辦法。</p>
<h3>戰時公務員忠孝難兩全</h3>
<p>國府頒褒揚辦法</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕國民政府爲念及戰時公務人員其在淪陷區之直系尊親死亡，均未奔喪成服，特頒訂申請褒揚辦法，可申請國府題詞，加蓋「榮典之　」大印，以示忠孝不能兩全，以資褒揚。其申請手續，由當事人就其所供職之機關呈轉國府文官處，申請時須繳呈死亡時家屬信電，以爲證明。</p>

<h3>還都令即可頒布　立法院例會定下月中在京舉行　政府促各黨提府委名單</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕政府還都日期，前由於運輸力遭遇限制暫未公布，然運輸負責當局正力謀改善，還都命令可望於短期內頒布，蓋事實上中央黨政軍各機關人員，已分批陸續赴京，刻京還都之中央各機關人員，以軍事機關辦理最爲迅速，全部留渝人員，最遲下月中可遷京完舉。靑年團中央團部已定於下月五日起分批東下，黨務機關預計於下月中旬開始，立法院例會已定於下月中在京舉行，監察，司法兩院人員，已陸續前往，國府職員亦定於下月初分批辦理，各機關之重要人員，將於五月前全部到達南京。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕外記者招待會，今日下午三時舉行，由吳部長國楨及劉次長鍇主持，關於政府改組事，吳部長稱：依據政治協商會議之決議，關於國府主席選任各黨派人士爲國府委員專，應由各黨派先行提名，政府前曾通知各黨派，望於二中全會開幕前提出，惟各黨派迄今尙未提出，政府現正催促各黨派迅速提名，以便進行政府之改組。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿七日電〕宣傳部長吳國楨聲稱：俟國府委員會改組爲各黨派聯合團體後，即將改組行政院，然後討論其他各黨派在行政院究佔多少席次。</p>

<h3>瀋陽秩序已逐漸恢復　董文琦談今後工作　注意衛生改善交通復興敎育重建工業</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿六日電〕瀋陽市董市長文琦在錦公畢，廿六日午乘機返瀋。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國軍正式接防瀋市後，此間秩序業已大定，記者特趨訪董市長文琦，茲誌在要問答如下：</p>
<p>（問）關內人士最關心者，爲瀋市之治安及民生兩問題，不知瀋市近日治安情形如何？</p>
<p>（答）在蘇軍開始撤退，國軍尙未按防以前，市區稍有混亂，是時曾發生三處火警，十三日晨國軍開入市區後，秩序即逐漸恢復。瀋陽警備司令部正式成立後，宵小多已歛跡，民心日益安定，目前瀋市地方武力，計有保安隊及行政警察共數千人，經整編後，素質尙佳。</p>
<p>（問）瀋市物價日漲，民生艱困，市府對策如何？</p>
<p>（答）最近瀋市物價趨漲之原因，要者爲蘇軍撤退後，市民對過去所發之軍用票，信心减低之故。持有軍用票者，均趕速拋出，換取物資，致近日市面上流通券頗不易見，市民極爲珍視。爲今之計，除於瀋市遵照東北行營經委會布吿，對軍用票與流通券繼續等値使用外，亟盼財部能及早確定辦法，以安人心。同時恢復交通，疏暢物資來源，則物價自可降低，蓋瀋市物價問題，其性質與關內各埠逈不相同也。</p>
<p>（問）今後瀋陽市政中心工作，市長可否見告？</p>
<p>（答）今後市政主要工作有四：（一）公共衛生問題，瀋陽市在接收前之七個月期間，市政廢弛，淸潔無人注意，市區內各處，垃圾山積，市府曾於上月發動淸除運動，經半個月之努力，全市垃圾已淸除大部，當繼續推進，務使垃圾絕跡，以减疾病。（二）市區交通問題，瀋陽市區廣二百五十二平方公里，人口達二百十六萬六千餘人，故交通問題極重要。電車過去有五十餘輛，現僅餘十餘輛，刻正趕速修復舊車，惟主要問題爲電力恢復，潘市工廠等所用電力，均靠松花江方面之高壓電，自共軍將東陵變壓所毁壞，致最近電源斷絕，瀋市之電車自來水，均因之停頓，現正積極趕修前東北兵工廠之大電廠，大的廿天後可以恢復。此外擬添置公共汽車，以利市內交通。（三）敎育問題，瀋市現已有卅六個小學開課，其餘正在積極整頓，當可繼續開學，惟目前最感缺乏者，厥爲師資，刻一面調訓各校敎員，一面成立師範，俾得造就完善師資。（四）工廠復工問題，瀋市大小工廠共達四千五百七十個，工人在百人以上者，亦達九百四十個，佔整個東北工業百分之六十，工人共有卅萬人，故爲供應民需及解決工人失業兩問題，工廠復工，實爲刻不容緩之事。巨前重工業恢復較難，民生工業較易，如將谷廠機器拚凑後，百分之廿工廠尙可開工，希望主管部門能迅速派人來此主持。</p>
<h3>遼陽及撫順附近共軍仍不斷攻擊</h3>
<p>四平街各工廠已被强佔</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿七日電〕國軍於接收遼陽·撫順等城後，現仍遭受共產軍不斷之攻擊，在遼陽週圍十五里附近地區及撫順東北地區，廿三·廿四兩日，共產軍數度向國軍猛攻，但均未獲逞。由鐵嶺北上接收蘇軍撤退地區之國軍，刻仍爲共產軍之猛烈攻擊所阻撓。</p>
<p>〔又電〕共產軍攻佔遼北省政府所在地四平街後，擅行組設省市縣區政署，分別任命省長，强佔各工廠，刦掠民財，並强迫市民開會，須對共產軍表示歡迎之意，否則即予逮捕，現已有市民百餘人下落不明。</p>
<h3>長春空氣仍緊張　防務接交聞將有明決定　我降落傘部隊在錦州待命</h3>
<p>〔本報長春廿六日電〕迎日來緊張空氣似漸趨緩和，謠言復爲事實所否定，當地人士慣曰「長春福地」似五十年來國際風雲角逐於此一地帶，而長春獨具「化險爲夷」之妙者，然實際上某種危險依然存在，日前於由鄕入城之柴車上，査獲機槍三挺，今日復有蘇坦克廿三輛經過大街，爬入車站，駛往他處，而市內警察保安險復於住地各有所布置，故一般現象指陳，在緩和表面下，潛伏有「緊張」。今日，我重事代表團團長董彥平曾與蘇軍參謀長特洛曾科晤談，內容未悉，然橫亙當前之問題，厥爲蘇軍究於何時撤離長春，國軍何時開抵長春。質言之，長春之交防接防，當有明確之決定，因瀋陽式之交防，應屬過去，今後之交防接防，自長春開始，實應有新的方式，蓋此一問題，非僅長春人士爲此極表關切，哈爾濱乃至柬北其他各地，無不同深為念也。又今來一機，運走接收人員一批。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿七日電〕此間我方各軍事機關門前，均置有沙袋，並於建築物之四週趕築防禦工事，保安部隊且在各衝要地帶檢查車輛，空氣復趨緊張，然市內秩序仍安靜如常。</p>
<p>〔合衆社天津廿七日電〕今日此間報載：國軍配備精良之降落傘部隊一批，刻在錦州待命，準備接收蘇軍撤退地區。</p>

<p>〔中央社長春廿七日電〕據由四平獲釋歸來之遼北省府人員稱：此次攻陷四平之共軍，爲所謂「東北保安軍」，其中並有「新四軍」番號，屬「遼西軍區」管轄，其下級幹部多來自關內各地，遼西軍區政治委員隗鑄，握有該區軍政大權。按東北境內之共軍分三大派，其一爲「東北保安軍」，俗稱「水八路」，蓋係自水路來此。另一爲「東北人民自治軍」，俗稱「土八路」，但其幹部亦多來自延安，其根據地在東部一帶。此外，尙有「東北人民自衛軍」，根據地爲北滿一帶。</p>

<h3>蘇代表揚言將退出會議　安理會陷入僵局　杜魯門親自函致史達林　伊總理否認與蘇有協定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿七日廣播：在數小時內，安全理事會復將開會，聆取昨日成立之三強小組委員會報吿。屆時安安全理事會是否接受蘇聯之請求而將伊如問題延至四月十日討論，即可揭曉。按蘇聯代表葛羅米柯昨已聲明：若大會對伊朗問題在四月十日前予以討論，蘇方將退出會議，因此，會議已陷於嚴重之似局。爲挽救此種危機起見，杜魯門總統已親自函致史達林，該　現山新任美國駐蘇大使史密斯携帶在身，史氏明日可抵莫斯科，局勢預料即可急轉直下。同時英代表買德幹爲應付危機，亦已電倫敦請示新辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二卞七日廣播：出席安全理事會之法國代表龐萊今日奉法政府命令，對伊朗問題，担任調解人地位，並竭力保衛大西洋憲章，維護小國之主權。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二十七日廣播：伊朗總理今日否認渠曾就蘇軍退出伊境問題與蘇聯成立新協定。此說頗可靠，因伊方始終未贊同安全理事會延期討論伊朗問題也。觀察家認為蘇聯請求延　之理由有二：（一）在四月十日前伊朗油產問題談判可吿結束；（二）伊朗政府之改組及亞　爾拜然之地位屆時亦可決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿六日電〕聯合安全理事會今日會議，以九對二票接受美英兩國主張，決定將蘇伊案列入議程第四項。與美英兩國處於同一陣綫者有中國·澳洲·墨西哥·埃及·荷蘭·法國·巴西，僅波蘭反對。中國代表郭泰祺處於理事會主席地位，故未投票。蘇聯代表葛羅米極堅強奮鬥失敗後，乃建議將該案展期至四月十日討論。葛羅米柯宣稱，安全理事會討論伊朗　訴案之會議，彼不能出席。此言用意是否係指理事會如否決其展期建議，彼將退席，抑尙未接得莫斯科訓令，准其於此時參加討論，則尙不明瞭。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿七日電〕本社頃自權威方面探悉：伊朗駐美大使阿勒，已由伊朗政府授予全權，回今日之安全理事會會議，抗議蘇軍之繼續佔領伊朗北部及干涉伊朗之內政。蘇代表葛羅米哥於昨日之理事會會議席上，對於阿勒大使是否有權代表共政府發言一點，曾表示懷疑，伊朗方面發言人為此特別聲明，指陳阿勒大使於過去數日來與德黑蘭政府保持經常之接觸，伊政府並囑其變更或撤回渠所根據三月十五日所獲訓令而向安全理事會提出之抗議，此間今日所獲德黑蘭來電，證實蘇聯及伊朗政府並未成立解決爭端之協定。</p>
<h3>軍事參謀團會議　商震當選為主席　首次會議歷時僅十分鐘　英美不擬提原子彈問題</h3>
<p>〔央社紐約廿廿六日專電〕我國出席聯合國軍事參謀團會議商震將軍，已於該會議本日在此舉行之自次會議中，當選爲會議主席。蘇聯代表瓦西列夫將軍放棄候選人資格，支持商震將軍當選。渠之主席任務，至四月三十日期滿，此與聯合國安理會情形不同，安全理事會之主席，係按各國名稱爲首之字母排列次序，田其代表輪流担任。軍事參謀會議之主席，則係以資歷爲標準，僉認商震將軍，於美蘇英法各國代表中，資歷最高，渠曾於軍中服務二十五年之久。本日舉行之首次會議，歷時僅十分鐘，明日將繼續集會，討論各小組委會就組織國際警衛軍之計劃所提之報吿。軍事參謀團會議工作極爲秘密，與會代表，均拒絕說明所指定者爲何小組委會，及所討論之議題爲何。據美國代表凱尼將軍稱：會議將討論防禦各項問題，原子彈問題，如經提出，亦將提付討論。聞渠曾稱：英將不於會議中，提出原子彈問題，以為討論之議題，然其他國家，若予提出，實亦無法加以阻止，凱尼將軍繼對近傳軍事參謀團已佔計交由安全理事會調度之軍隊，爲數約二百萬人一說，加以否認。</p>

<h3>市臨時參議會成立</h3>
<p>上海市臨時參議會於今日宣吿成立，即將開會集議，對於本市市政應興應革諸端，必將有所決議，送由市政當局付諸實施。此一會議之成立，饒具有歷史的意義。市參議會之稱爲臨時，係因該會會員爲客觀環境所限，必能民選；目前市政當局正在樻極籌備市參議員之選舉，在民選參議員未產生以前，於是就有這個臨時參議會以爲過渡，此在時間上當不致過長。此次市臨時參議會諸會員，雖由政府派充，然所包人選來自金融·工商·輿論·敎育文化各界，俱爲一時之選，足孚衆望，故本屆臨時參議會縱非直接由市民選舉而產生，郤能充分代表上海市民公意。上海爲中國第一都市，抗戰勝利以後，河山光復，原有之特殊區域如從前的「法租界」及「公共租界」，今供不復復存在。上海市政之統一，賴我忠勇之將士與蔣主席所領導之奮鬥得以完成。上海市臨時參議會之成立，適値此歷史之會，其意味自至深長。</p>
<p>市政措施在在與人民生活息息相關；我國萬稱地方長官爲親民之官，爲父母之官，可見其如何與人民接近。市政措施的是否得宜，人民所蒙受到的直接影響最深，故市政措施，尤須考慮周詳。上海爲國際都市，過去又有「租界」；故上海市政的措施，尤爲國際人士所密切關心，市政措施是否得宜，不特關係全市人民，抑亦有關國際視聽。今上海市臨時參議會，成立於上海，因於當前市政　　略有所論列，藉備市臨時參議會之採擇，兼以祝賀。</p>
<p>（一）確立上海市財政系統上海自收復以來，市政收人，不敷支應。據報載消息，本市本年二月份收支不數，數逾六萬萬元。時値非常，市財政之未能走上軌道，原爲一時所不可避免之現象。顧今茲國家當建國之會，上海之收復，爲時已逾七月，市政建設爲建國之一部，允宜把握時機，向前邁進。但市政建設在在需款，要以建立市財政系統爲首要。似此偌大之都市，而其主要之稅源為娛樂筵席捐之所得，市財政之不健全不合理可知。査我國財政系統有中央地方之分，戰時為集中力量，進行作戰，以是大部稅源集於中央；地方稅收，乃趨枯竭。今抗戰勝利，中央與地方財政系統之劃分，似應重爲調整。娛樂筵席捐爲一般消費稅，市民貧富不均，而負担相同實有背於「按能力納稅」之原則。美國在滬士兵前曾呼籲要求免納此等捐稅，經市長核准。國人値長期戰爭以後，休養生息，此正其時，娛樂筵席捐縱不能取消，亦應减低，以免擾民。廣　稅源，應就受市政實惠獨多之公司·工廠·行號爲均等直接之徵收，使市財政之重心，漸自消費稅取締稅移轉至直接稅，市財政系統方克確立。</p>
<p>（二）安定上海市人民生計　上海爲我工商業之中心，其地人口達五百萬。收復以來，工廠多陷停頓，失業人數激增；或則工潮迭起，物價騰漲，以是人民生計，未能安定。此中原因雖極複雜，有非市政當局所能控制者；然市政當局，自應竭其可能謀市民生計之安定。在過去七個月中，市政當局之揹施，其直接影響上海市民生活者，往往取締多於扶持。一紙禁令，動輒千萬人之生活，受其影響。當此艱難時會，市政當局不但未能爲市民廣開生路，即其原有之生計亦以取締而動盪。上海市民在敵僞暴政下盼國軍之重來，而收復以來所得到的不是溫煦，却是酸辛；此在一般人民印象中實爲一件極不明智的事。而且其中一件最荒謬的事，就是在巴黎東京廢止公娼制度以後，上海的市政當局還擬在上海建立起公娼制度來，此不僅爲上海市之恥，抑亦爲全中國之恥。爲了保持上海的名譽，中國的國格，我們不容許在上海有公娼制度的建立，「風化區」的劃分。今上海市臨時參議會成立，我們希望參議會諸公能督促市政當局多從積極方面來扶持上海市民生活的安定，少發一些取締或剝削人民基本自由的禁令。</p>
<p>（三）建立上海市交通系統　上海市爲我國第一大都市，近代都市，必有完善之交通系統。紐的倫敦，地下鐵道，四通八達，又復有公共汽車，電車行駛全市。倫敦紐的均有專管運輸機稱，主持其事。上海過去因有「租界」存在，各自為政，以致整個市交通系統，迄未建立。收復以來，上海市政當局就原有規模，爲積極之調整。據昨日本報所載消息：市公用局現正計劃將全市電車、無軌電車、公共俗汽車之交通路綫，重加有系統之整理，主要幹綫由有軌無軌電車行駛，支綫以公共汽車行駛。査現代都市交通，因路面交通頻繁，有軌電車已不適用。倫敦紐的乃至巴黎莫斯科其主要交通幹綫，多賴地下鐵道，即東京亦有地下鐵道之運輸。爲未來之上海繁榮計，似應拋棄有軌電軍而爲地下鐵道網之計劃。若就目前狀况而言，公共汽車迄未暢復，以是電車擁擠不堪；亟應加以改善。積極建立上海交通系統，實爲恢復上海繁榮必要之圖。</p>
<h3>一位聰明美麗的義大利女郞　女間諜貝安卡　（續完）</h3>
<p>— 本報廣州特派員　梁風</p>
<p>她說：她的美色，引起了許多纏繞；許多人因為愛不到她而對她憎恨。</p>
<p>至於她的丈夫譚先生，原來是新一軍搜萦營上校營長，廣東新會人，現在的確在廣州。他對貝安卡的被捕，認為是「美貌爲招禍之由』。他不相信貝安卡是個間諜，他說：一九三八年他帶了貝安卡和兩個孩子蒞羅馬返國，他曾將貝安卡安置在貴州的都勻，在那兒住了兩年多，因爲飛機大天的轟炸，她遷往桂林，在桂林仍然是受着敵機威脅，於是他便又將她送往香港。到香港適又因歐戰已經爆發，英政府將貝安卡驅逐了，她於是到了上海。他從那時起便不能再和貝安卡通消息了。隨後她又到廣州　，香港，廣州去找尋她的丈夫，在那時便跟西門認識。不久她還得到了丈夫在緬甸戰死了的消息，她爲了生活，爲了孩子，所以要跟西門同居。到日本將要投降的時候，她爲孩子的病，從廣州回到上海。到戰事吿終了，她從一位曾經和她丈夫在緬甸一起作過戰的美軍少校的口裏，知道她的丈夫已經回到廣州了，她於是很高興地在去年十一月十一百回到廣州，可是到廣州後仍找不到她的丈夫，旅館又過擠找不到房間，她便仍然走到沙面住在西門那裏，可是當時她已經被常局認爲有間諜嫌疑，早被監視着了。這位譚上校像很感慨的說了上面那些話，最後他還提出幾點爲她申辯的理由：（一）她是有五個孩子的母親，而且她是貴族出身，她是犯不着充當間諜。（二）她來往粤滬之間是坐民航機，這是依照正當手續在日軍部申請的。（三）指她與日人來往，常時純爲申請護照，日人覺她美貌，諸多稽延。（四）她爲日人前後拘禁四次，因她是重慶軍官的妻子，被疑爲重慶間諜，於此可見與日人沒有關係。（五）她與西門同居純爲生活所迫。（六）在廣州可以找到的證人有法國領事館的秘書和一個日本人，不過證明她是好人的證人，在上海更多。</p>
<p>經這位譚上校道樣的替貝安卡申辯過之後，使這案情更複雜起來了。而貝安卡也再三說她是爲了美貌而招　，這樣很容易使這宗間諜案轉移爲桃色案件。貝安卡究竟是不是一個女間諜呢？大家都不禁在疑惑。</p>
<p>十九日的下午，行營派了戰犯調査組主任湯炎光上校，帶了一位翻譯官到醫院裏去，作非正式的審訊過貝安卡一次。</p>
<p>「你帶到廣州來的一千四百餘萬國幣是做什麽的？』湯上校開始問。</p>
<p>「這些錢是上海一位朋友唐先生托我買美鈔回去圖利的。後來換得美鈔一萬一千二百元。除了五千元失去外，餘下六千二百餘美鈔，巳由自己丈夫轉送回去。」貝安卡的答覆。</p>
<p>「你戰時在上海，一家數口，如何生活？」湯上校再問。</p>
<p>「由西門負担的！因爲她愛我美貌，故供給我。」她將秋波送給這位嚴肅的湯上校。</p>
<p>「你什麽時候在上海京都大飯店四〇七號房間，和些什麽日本人來往過？什麼名字？還有一位中國人董先生認識嗎？」</p>
<p>「董先生認識的，日本人的名字都忘記了。」</p>
<p>「你何時跟西門同居，有合作過什麽事沒有？」</p>
<p>「在一九四二年，沒有合作辦過事，除了娛樂之外，睡覺我是最喜歡的。」</p>
<p>「你是否認識很多日本人，不然，在戰時來往上海，廣州，廣州灣你能乘坐飛機和兵艦？」</p>
<p>「沒有，來往各地坐船　飛機，都是依照正當手續的。」</p>
<p>「你出入齊藤的辦公室很方便，而且很多次？」</p>
<p>「他是管航政的，故時常到他辦公室請求發照而已。」</p>
<p>「你是什麽國藉？」</p>
<p>「義大利，嫁給了中國人，現在是中國藉。」</p>
<p>貝安卡在答覆湯上校問話的時候，也不斷在表情，有時在微笑，嫵媚地望着湯上校。然有時却又在雙眉深鎖，在這短短時間裏，她先後哭過四次哩。最後湯上校要她在一張承認她說過「嫁給中國人，是中國籍。」和「當時一切生活係由西門負祖」的供詞上簽了一個字，湯上校也就退出了。</p>
<p>記者隨着湯上校離開了博濟醫院，曾作過頗長時間的談話。據他表示：做作和表情是一般女間諜的慣技，她剛才那般樣子，在他們已經是見貫的了。她曾對各報記者發表，總間是因爲她的美色而招禍，這很可能是故意轉移人家的目光吧了。其實這事情並非那麽簡單，實在是相當複雜的。現在有關這女間諜案的資料，行營方面已經搜集了不少，待再詳爲硏究之後，自然可以發表的。</p>
<p>記者又將譚上校代貝安卡申辯的幾點提出問湯上校，他的答覆是：譚某和貝安卡結過婚是事實，不過他們已經離了婚的。他們離婚是在上海，證鱸已經在我們手上，不過現在他們好　　沒有提到他們離婚的事。假如他們確是在戰時離了婚的話，那在一九四一年以後的事情，關於貝安卡的一切行動，譚某自然是不會知道的，他實在不應該替她申辯。至於說她是一個貴族出身，犯不着充間諜，這也是不足作爲根據的，我們大家都知道，世界上有兩名最出名的女間諜，都是貴族出身的。再說她戰時來往上海廣州廣州灣間所乘的都是民航機，你想，在戰時敵人的交通工具完全是受統制的，如果沒有多少日本人的關係，不見得來往那麽容易吧？又說到因爲她的貌美，有許多人因爲愛她不到而致對勉憎恨，這顯然是想把這事情移到桃色糾紛上面去，如果我們眞的相信這個說法，那就完全錯誤了。其實現在她和西門曾經同居過的關係還在其次，重點還在好過去和日本要人來往的問題哩！</p>
<p>湯上校否定了譚上校代貝安卡的申辯。他似乎對這案件，已經成竹在胸，不過未至發表時期，不便多說吧了。</p>
<p>時間已不早了，記者便和湯上校分手。</p>
<p>聰明美麗的貝安卡，依然是很安靜的睡在博濟醫院裏。我相信，假如她是個好人，現在她還是很安靜的；但，如果她眞的是一個日本間諜的話，那末，她的枷鎖還沒有擺脫的，這枷鎖至少會套着她的靈魂。</p>

<h3>淸理財產及債務　英美成立協定　美以在英剩餘物資全部讓與　英不得將任何租借武器輸出</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿七日電〕英國駐美大使哈立法克斯勳爵，美國副國務卿艾克遜分別代表聯合王國及美利堅合衆國，於今日簽訂處理租借剩餘財產及淸理戰時債權債務之協定。全文長五千字，包括九點，足以補充去年十一月所訂英美財政協定之遺漏，使因租借法案而產生之債務，完全理淸。美國將以其在英國之陸海軍剩餘財產，全部讓與英國，以達柯太式運輸機六七二架，讓與英國，另以該種飛機六七一架，租與英國。自租借法案停止適用後，至去年十二月底爲止，兩國問因物資相互供應而產生之債權債務，當實行抵銷淸償。去年年底以後，交換之物資，應以現金支付爲原則。根據此一協定，聯合王國非軍事當局於去年九月二日所佔有之租借物品，其中除載重一百噸以上之船舶，非戰鬥飛機及石油產物外，均由英國政府取得完全所有權。英國政府應負責交還美國所請求索還之財產、若欲將財產轉讓英國以外之政府式殖民地常局，應先徵求美國政府之同意，美國陸海軍在英國之剩餘財產，悉由英國取得，惟英國政府應使聯合國善後救濟總署，有以合理價格購取剩餘財產之機會。英國並須保證不以剩餘財產重新輸回美國，並不得對美國製造商有所歧視。英國在未得美國同意前，不得將任何租借法案下之武器輸出。</p>

<h3>寄柩移動時須申請護照</h3>

<h3>煤斤來源增旺</h3>
<p>燃料管制委員會，經向外商租借船隻，分赴秦皇島·台灣·蚌埠·徐州等地，運輸煤斤，以供應靑島以南，廣州及津滬浙江一帶電力·火車·船舶燃料，其數量日見加增，按照統計，本月份秦皇島可到十二萬噸，台灣可到一萬五千噸，蚌埠附近之淮南煤礦可到二萬噸，徐州之華東煤礦，亦可到一萬噸，最低限度，總計可陸續到速十五萬噸左右。此次除照例分配以上各地公用事業及國營工廠外，本埠各民營工廠，由各同業公會申請，亦可酌量當時存煤情形，予以多寡之分配，的計實發數量，必在兩萬噸以上。至申請單位，以染織業工廠需量最大，家用白煤，業已派輪分赴安南鴻基地方採購，不久當有兩萬噸到達，則對煤球原料，可以加增。</p>

<h3>美國外剩餘物資淸理會　發售吉普車百國內人　承購者限新聞界美籍老軍人醫生</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據美國外剩餘物資淸理委員會昨日宣稱：該會頃已配得吉普車一百輛，以應本市新聞界，美籍老軍人，醫生等交通急需之用。此舉與該會大量處理之基本政策，顯有變動，惟據稱此次係屬例外，而該項動議，純係爲便利上述各界人士之交通問題而起。該會所以遲遲未將此舉付諸實施之原因，蓋恐引起一般人競作無謂之申請。本市之新聞界，美籍老軍人及醫生等，可自即日起，兩週內用書面（兩份）向該會申請，惟爲便利計，該會對親自前往申請者，將不予接受，其發售之對象，亦絕對以上述各界人士爲限。按最近本市曾有一新聞從業員，爲該會備就本市新聞界之申請名單一份，該會發覺申請者過於踴躍，間有不合理之申請，所需車輛之數目，又極龐大，故現經規定：申請者必須備函向該會發售部申請，該部將斟酌各機構之資格，分別配給一輛至二輛。申請時旣母須預繳保證金，更不收取佣金，交易純由該會單獨處理。本輛之售價，將視車身情形之新舊，而稍有不同。聞將根據每輛美金一千三百十四元之數目而减去其折舊率，承購者須負擔所有一應關稅費用。最近本市所傳低價廉售之事，並非事實。</p>

<p>五項輸入物品須先申請許可</p>
<p>茲者卅日即將於後於本月卅一日起，下列十九項奢侈裝飾品，將絕對禁止進口，但經主管機關核准者，則不在其內。計爲：（一）修指甲用全副器具及零件，粉撲·粉盒·梳粧盒。（二）香水脂粉。（三）玩具及游戲品。（四）容七座以下之汽車，其對於推銷商之出廠價格超過美金一千二百元者，及該項車之車台。（五）麝香。（六）象牙製品。（七）古玩。（八）鑲金屬品。塞蘇瑪磁器·漆器。（九）傘·柄及全部，或一部爲貴重金屬，象牙·雲母殼·玳瑁·瑪瑙或飾有寳石者，及其他類柄之綢傘·絲夾·雜質綢傘。（十）棉質假金銀綫。（十一）花邊衣飾·綉貨·其他裝飾用品。（十二）純毛或雜毛。（十三）純絲或雜絲假金銀絲。（十四）純絲或雜絲針織綢緞。（十五）純絲或雜絲剪絨回絨。（十六）未列名純絲或雜絲綢緞。（十七）未列名衣服及衣着零件。（十八）未列名純絲或雜絲貨品。（十九）未列名裝飾用材料及製品。（洋鏡片·銅箔綆·銅箔綫·金屬製裝飾零件等在內）。至於須向該管理處申請許可後始得輸入之物品，計共有五項：爲（一）煤油，（二）糖，（三）烟草，（四）客車及車台，（禁止進口者不在其內），（五）已洗電影，除外均可自由進口。</p>
<p>美最新式汽車首批下月可到</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自太平洋戰爭以來，本市新汽車迄無到貨。勝利後，各汽車公司，重吿活躍，紛紛向美國訂購各種最新型汽車，同時開始接受用戶登記預定，每輛收定費美金一千元，俟交貨時，照市結算，多還少補。聞第一批汽車已由美國起運，將於下月中旬到埠，價目約每輛美金三千元零。凡去年十二月十日以前預定者，皆可能交貨，而目下前往登記者，最快於本年八月中始能交貨，但價格或較前數批為低也。</p>

<h3>平價粉繼續拋售昨起已恢復收款　每袋仍售六千元</h3>

<p>繳款時間　三時至五時</p>
<p>記者曾以平價麺粉一度停止供應之事，叩諸「行總」負責方面，據吿：該署早已表示無限制拋售平價麵粉之決意，今後當盡力辦到，決無中止之意。此次該署並未一度停止拋售，實因各收款銀行，因代收粉款，影響正常營業，致臨時停收，遂使平價麵粉供應，爲之中止。現經將各行收款之時間，調整爲每日（週日除外）下午三時至五時，新定收款時間，已在各行營業時問之外，當不致對各行營業，有所影響。</p>
<p>防止流弊　每人限一包</p>
<p>又據吿該署規定每人只能購粉一包之限制，意在防止「黄牛黨」之大批收買營利，而正當市民，反無法購得。惟「黄牛黨」之活躪，頗有窮於應付之苦，現該署正擬另定購粉新辦法，以杜絕此流弊。至「行總」署長蔣廷　氏，自出席「聯總」糧食會議後，將於四月初旬返抵本市，屆時對「聯總」調整糧食之分配案，將有詳盡之報吿。</p>
<p>運華小麥　達十五萬噸</p>

<h3>警局巡迥查禁中　証劵黑市飛漲　統丙見三千三新高價　股票行市則愈抬愈高</h3>
<p>公債再起風浪，丙種上塲即穿出三千元關外，最高見三二〇〇元高價，業中始有出籠，低價退至二九〇〇元，午刻仍回至三千元有零，結果較前收計甲乙回二〇〇元，丙種　起四五〇元，丁種升一五〇元，戊升一〇〇元，收後做手復動，丙種哄至三三〇〇元新高價，華嚴中途一度遭當局査禁，華僑大樓以及散處其他各地之對敲號家，亦相率歇手，迨巡邏者一去，繼續興高彩烈，各證劵號家　作拋球場，愈拋愈高，午刻都以高峯結束，究其原因，內行外行並無眞理可以解答，一言以蔽之，游資所趨，以熱門股三數隻區區流通籌碼，永紗美亞由千數而晋級萬數，照眼前情形，指日可待，離投資過遠，設有意外劇變，無非苦了一般散戶而已，各熱門最低價在中途時曾低於開盤少許，結果較前收計永紗美亞各漲一成餘，景福等三小熱則激漲二成至三成不等，新光哄捧有人，後來居上，凌駕景福，領導小股，午後初疲後穩，最後永紗五四〇〇元，美亞四四〇〇元，景福四一五元，外股走勢與華股相同，買戶踴躍，結果以冷熱　　，　　收　起一成至三成不等。</p>
<h3>金價平穩　最低做一五三結果小一萬五</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍難振作，跌勢雖屬有限，無如大勢已去，執有者售多於買，意興闌　，極難奮發，査晨開微挫，開後稍形平穩，中行配給價仍未更動，業中以價過高，自無登記必要，但黑市並不因無配給來源而見緊，此後反轉鬆動，曾見一五三萬低價，午刻在一五五萬左右，午後交易過程均寂，結果較前收微降一萬五，美鈔套頭續見軋攏，飾金十六萬八，　　一千六，銀元一千一，暗拆平平，銀根似鬆，息價仍站一角六至二角不等。</p>
<h3>美鈔回好　新港票盤旋</h3>
<p>外幣美鈔初疲後堅，進口貨欲結匯票，難獲頭寸，午後買氣稍活而趨穩，晨開在一九五〇元以下，初時平和，午刻微升，在一九六〇元弱，午後供方較衰，喊價趨高，對黄金套價軋攏至七八〇元對十兩，結果較前收回好二十五元，港票老穩，新貨恍惚，結果老貨稍好五元，新貨多盤，三十六年軋跌五元，三十七年則微升五元，港電羅比仍形平穩。</p>
<h3>美衆院通過法案　准許財部出售白銀　定價為每盎司七一·一一美分</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十七日電〕美衆院最近　過法案一件，准許財政部以每盎司七一·一一美分出售白銀，以供工業上應用，西部鑛區各州參議員對此均表示强烈反對，某參議員在參議院經費分配委員會中力主財政部所有自由處置之白銀二萬四千萬盎司，應以每盎司美金一元二角九分變爲現金，按財政部得於戰時出售白銀以供工業上應用之特許期限，已於上年十二月屆滿。</p>
<h3>米市堅定　豆油來源絡繹</h3>
<p>昨米市以貨主人心雖堅，奈店胃平常，而河下到存均有，是以欲漲無力，仍見平平之狀，麵粉胃呆少神，略削百元，麩皮亦止漲轉跌，價回小二三百元，豆餅供過於求，價疲而少神，黄豆消化依然淸淡，續降三五百元，生仁趨勢仍定，到消兩平，油市以靑島來貨湧旺，開封亦有到源，蚌埠徐州等處，零星續到，兼之敵僞管理處發售各汕店平價油，正在出售之中，按市以九折計算，是以汕價一時恐難向榮。</p>
<p>又訊，本市昨日到米，的計四千餘石，內白粳二八七三石，薄稻八二三石，早稻二三〇石，其餘爲秈糯米。</p>
<h3>茶葉交易稀少　徽茶源源而來</h3>
<p>本市茶葉市况，連日有疲莫能興之槪，至其原因，天津等帮因銷路呆滯關係，納胃趦趄，而本街店莊雖有染指，然均祗零星胃口，而一般賣戶獲利之後，又頻有湧基，是以市氣頻頻帶軟，其中更以溫州白琳爲最。</p>
<p>又訊，勝利以後，錮禁已久之茶葉，威望大量出口，以致競相躉購，價格突飛猛進，數年來存貯未動之徽茶，其價格幾與滬地無甚軒輊，尤以津帮茶商，抵徵採購，更屬挺俏，是以產地價格，始終堅持上風，不願低售，惟以近月米天津茶市，旣無生色，出口價格，又待提高，新安江之存茶數量，出運者僅及三分之一，而此間出口者，僅汪裕泰一家裝出一千六百箱，餘則咸望外價之提升，現由屯溪　杭之茶葉，每艘可載二百箱之船隻運價爲六十萬元，汽車　運至淳安每箱爲一千二百元，再由淳裝船至杭每箱爲八百元，車輛甚缺乏。</p>
<h3>棉紗市場冷落　現棉交易完全停頓</h3>
<p>日紗市仍無起色，緣天不做美，正當上市之際，大雨傾盆，致業中人到會不多，市塲冷落之至，雙馬價尙平穩，其餘廿支紗求售有人，而買主寥寥，均降二三萬之譜，細紗及綫去化尤爲阻滯，人心仍未脫軟弱之象，紡建昨開售呢于麻毛毯嗶嘰等類，共計二十四種，聞今日照例開售棉紗云。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉報跌十一至十七磅音，計近期美金二六·九七，遠期二六·九一，米特林現貨二七·五五，本埠現棉交易完全停頓，緣棉紗棉布均鮮起色，而外棉來源不絕，滬埠存數有增無减，廠家與花商心思大都看小，紡建公司亦無談判消息，是以現棉交易絕無做開，日月底迫近，廠號出月方有進出云。</p>

價」，「航空運輸」，「水道運輸」，「鐵道會計」等，凡是一個鐵道管理，或運輸管理者應有的知識和理論，在第三年中打下了　固的基礎，同時對於金融的知識，如財政·貨幣·國際貿易，國際匯兌等課程，亦是不可缺少的，所以亦在這一年中全部授完。至第四年，則是比較高深的理論，像鐵道行車經濟學，是專門討論鐵道運輸的技術的管理，像貨站的設計，終點站的行軍設備，行車制度和手續，列車的編組和開發，行車事變的處理和防備等，都在它的範圍內，再如站務管理，是站長對車站建築，謀水設備，軌道分類，員工的統率，以及站容整飭等應有的知識，再如「機車構造」，「鐵路工程」，「鐵路材料管理」等等課程，更是養成一個優良站長或負責運輸者不可或少的知識。總之四年的課程，除了有關鐵道及運輸的學識外，還加以普通商學院四年的課程，這樣訓練出來的結果，不僅是一個鐵道管理者，同時也是一個良好的會計員。平院在過去設了「財務管理」和「鐵道管埋」二系，抗戰後，因了社會的需要，於是專心於訓練鐵道管理的人才了。八年來的耕耘，數百個靑年，給祖國的動脈，鐵路和公路，做着疏通的工作！　　近狀　　回過筆來，我們報吿一下平院的近狀。八年來的平院，除了物質困難外，精神上還是八年前那麽愉快，三十多年傳統的精神，洋溢在每個人的面上。八年來，數千百顆年靑的心嚮注着她，而能投入她懷抱的，只是十分之一。八年來，不但受了靑年們的熱愛，亦受到社會上的讚許，只要從畢業生之被預定一空，可見社會是怎樣的需要她呢！　　勝利帶來了狂歡，亦帶來了苦悶，平院的復員，亦在苦悶中蠕進着。在北平的校舍，雖然從敵人手中拿了回來，可是又給人家佔用了去，「交涉」只是沒有力量的辦法。「平院學生遷校協進會」由平院全體同學組織的，目的在協助她加速的復員，而校友們，亦熟烈的爲她奔走和接洽復員的問題。根據校友的來函，平院今夏可以遷返北平，不過校舍恐有問題。而院長的人選，亦決定由余士宣校友担任。尤其使同學感到興奮的，本屆的畢業生，或可全部派往長春鐵路工作。　　爲了適合建國的需要，今後的平院，更將培育「工業管理」和「財務管理」的人才，和她二位大哥共同負起交通建設的使命！　　三五，三，二一，於四川璧山。</h3>

<p>自由談　婦女与家庭特輯人物偉大的奎松夫人  余範　　奎松總統是個賢明的領袖，生前備受菲列濱全國人民的愛戴，至今遺愛猶在人間，菲列濱各處城市街道建築物紛紛以奎松爲名，藉留紀念，而誌不朽。最近菲列濱議會又公決以每月一千元菲幣的恩俸贈給這位故總統的年老夫人，以表全國人民的敬意。可是當第一次的俸金送去時，却遭奎松夫人原對退回，不肯收受，她的回信中所述令人非常感動，她說：「當我想到這次戰爭遣留下多少的寡妻孤兒，我就覺得我不應該享受這些恩俸。我自問良心我決不能接受政府的補助，現在世界上正有許多可憐的姊妹和她們的孩子孤苦無依，嗷嗷待哺，她們比我更爲不幸，她們比我更需要帮助與救濟……」　　這些話充分表現出奎松夫人是一位怎樣偉大的女性，同時也可以想見菲列濱人民爲什麼把她當作一位母后兼聖人一般的崇拜。同時她的信裏也提起她的丈夫：「我知道我倘若接受這些錢，我將無以對我摯愛的丈夫於地下……」奎松在生前對這位高貴的夫人非常尊敬，她不僅是一個偉大領袖的賢內助，實在也不愧有國母之稱。奎松夫人現在仍是勤儉自奉，淡泊而寗靜，一些沒有居高位而驕奢淫佚的壞習氣，尤其在當今苦難的時代，她是一個舉世共仰的模範。社會從艷屍說起  承浚　　霞飛路泰山公寓四樓的無名艷屍案，已說載海上各報。死者之如何妖冶艷麗，風流淫蕩，自有好事者去探訪渲染，供人們酒醉飯後談笑的資料。但我旣非好事者，更無此雅興。我始終認爲這是一椿慘案，而在它的背後，實隱藏着無數的社會問題，尤其是有關婦女的問題，不能不提出說說。　　據報紙所載，大概死者生前是一個交際化，已毫無疑義。交際花在上海，似乎已成爲一部份婦女的自由職業。交際而達到花的程度，其魔力和誘力可想而知。但我們試閉目一想：她們究竟在用什麽手段和方式交際？牠們用以交際的資本是什麼？又她們所交際的對象是那些人？這實是變相的賣淫啊！迫使她們走上這一條路，當然社會要負一部分的責任，但你能說她們本身一無罪責嗎？　　女子高度的功利主義，享樂主義和虛榮心，實是驅使她們走上這條路的內燃機。若說爲了生活而被迫出此，那簡直是痴人說夢話。你不見工廠的女工，鄕村的農婦，她們不是也爲着謀生而工作嗎？，但她們知道用自己的勞力，去獲取生活的代價，問題是在肯不肯吃苦，豈可將罪惡完全推諉於「生活」上面。而且誰不要生活？爲什麼她們就只能採取那種腐化的生活方式，不去流血汗求生呢？其問究竟什麼劣根性在作祟，聰明的讀者當可不言而喻。　　愛美本是人類的天性，人類之所以想熱烈的生活下去，也就是想造成一個美的世界；但「美」決不是妖冶艷麗，而是「靈魂的純潔」所表現於外表的「雅致宜人」。所以一般打扮得妖冶的婦女，不是誤解「美」的意義，就是別具用心。看到上海很多的婦女，畫眉塗脂，亦步亦趨，極盡妖冶之能事。我想她們也許在羨慕交際花式闊綽的生活，而想做一個「交際花」吧！那是多危險的事。我眞爲這些婦女杞憂。　　婦女的自由解放，是要用自已堅忍耐勞的精神去獲取的。翻開人類的歷史，本來是女權的社會，男子怎樣從念子手中奪回社會的支配權？除了生理上的限制外，那也許是男子比較能忍勞耐苦。所以一面打扮艷麗，生活不檢，一面喊着解放婦女的人，那眞是自欺欺人。艷屍的慘案，給予婦女界的警惕，該不是平凡微小的吧。家計談家用帳  渡雲　　百物漲價，生活固然艱難，但用錢不得其法，也會影響於收支之不平衡，惟一補救的方法，最好從記家用帳入手。　　筆者是向來記慣家用帳的，可謂二十年如一日，從未間斷過，月有月結，年有年結，收支分明，於心亦安。想我們在世爲人，生無所帶來，死無所帶去，一些過手錢財也無非受造物者之托，當個司帳而已，見財思義，不苟取，化錢思宜，不妄用，一一記之於帳，可以自己審核，養成廉潔行爲，其利一。　　量入爲出，古有明訓，雖物價日漲，多少也有些預算，記家用帳便是便利預算，其利二。　　上月一斗米價，一千幾百元；本月一斗米價要二千幾百元，廿六年米價每石多少，卅年米價多少，假若一向記帳，你便可査知物價如何高漲，指數比較若干，做個歷史性的參考，其利三。　　每月終結，發現本月娛樂費太多，下月應當節省；應酬費過份，下月應當節制，鑒前懲後，知所用度，其利四。　　禮尙往來，可以査對家用帳，送禮合式，不致輕重倒置；尤其記有月日，有時可補日記之不足，其利五。　　總之，記家用帳，便是使家用入於正軌的初步，不致胡塗妄用，也不致捉襟見肘。　　家用帳不求其繁瑣，而以簡單爲主或每日一結，或一月一結，各就便利而行。若用普通市上出售之家用帳簿，只消塡個數字便得。若用中文，可分項目，於下記個數碼亦可，總之，以便利省時爲主。普通項目，可分伙食，果點，衣服，房租，應酬，醫藥，家具，雜用，書報，文具，娛樂，車資，郵資，捐稅已足。結婚  多心輯　　我們結婚，爲的是要增自家的快樂，不是要討別人的歡喜。—畢克爾史達夫　　婚姻之於人生，有如軍略之於戰役，一個人也祗能失算一次。—白格萊　　祗爲金錢而結婚的人，其惡無比，祗爲戀愛而結婚的人，其愚無比。—的翰生　　在一夫一妻制的社會中，結婚是等於分去了你一半的權利，增加了你一倍的義務。—粟本華　　結婚的和獨身者相較，結婚的少了許多美夢，但得到相當安全；多了些顧慮，但少了些危險；享到更多的快慰，也嘗到更深的愁苦。—戴勒斯　　結婚這把戲，好似夏天花園中的鳥籠：在外面的鳥兒拼命的要向裏撲，裏面的鳥兒又是悶得慌，急切想飛逃出去。—韋白斯脫女紅自製小大衣  蕭淑芳　　春天已經來了，去年的小大衣孩子穿了覺得太小，但物價又在往上漲，一件小小衣裳也要幾萬元，實在太不經濟。我覺得做母親的不妨試做，如果剪裁合宜，縫熨平整，同裁縫做出來的也差不多。　　圖中的小大衣尺寸（英尺）合適於四五歲小女孩穿的。　　材料：可利用大人的舊呢絨大衣或裙子等改做。先把材料拆好，用溫皂水洗凈，掠乾熨平，襯裏等亦可用不穿的衣服改製。　　製法：依圖中尺寸剪裁。（可稍剪寬二三分以備縫口），用大針綳合，令孩子試穿一下，然後用機器軋好，（如果沒有機器，手縫亦可），成一背心形，然後安兩袖，肩處打摺或內縫進均可。再縫領及口袋，安上裏子，用熨斗熨平，領圈及鈕扣處可用粗絲線做上幾朶花，即成一簡便小大衣。偉大的母親  良弓　　千百年地過去了，太陽仍是這般熱；母親的溫暖，也依然永遠不滅。—哀倫海伊　　在家庭里有母親的愛，好比在曠野里有太陽的光。—非洲諺語　　母親的愛是世界上最寳貴的珍藏。—阿米契斯　　你問我所讀遍的書中那一本最偉大嗎？那就是我的母親。—林肯　　母親的心是小孩學校的敎室。—比秋</p>

<h3>Military Three-Person Committee Issues Order: Dispatching Teams to the Northeast; Political Issues to Be Decided Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Northern Peiping Dispatch, 27th] After Zhou Enlai's return to Chongqing, the Military Three-Person Committee, after further consultations, has decided to dispatch executive teams to the Northeast. It telegraphed the Northern Peiping Executive Headquarters today to make preparations for the selection of personnel for each team. The Executive Headquarters held meetings all day for this matter. Reporters learned from various sources that, in addition to receiving the above instructions, the Executive Headquarters has not yet received more detailed and specific principles. According to relevant sources, some principles for resolving the Northeast issue have already been decided or are being discussed by the Military Three-Person Committee in Chongqing. The Northeast executive teams will implement these principles. The authority of the teams sent to the Northeast is the same as that of those sent to various parts of North China, bearing the responsibility for resolving problems locally, and not just for investigating and collecting materials.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Before General Marshall returned to the United States, the Three-Person Conference reached an agreement to dispatch executive teams to the Northeast in the near future. To achieve this, government representative General Zhang Zhizhong, Communist representative General Zhou Enlai, and General Gillem, General Marshall's representative, continued to negotiate and have now reached an agreement. The instructions issued by the Military Mediation Department for the dispatch of executive teams to the Northeast are as follows: These executive teams, composed of carefully selected personnel, should be dispatched to the Northeast to carry out the following instructions: (1) The task of the teams is limited to military mediation work; (2) The teams should work in the areas of the government army and the Communist army, and avoid entering areas still occupied by Soviet troops; (3) The teams should go to conflict sites or locations where government and Communist forces are in close contact to stop conflicts and make necessary and fair mediations. All parties also agreed that the Three-Person Conference will continue to discuss military issues in the Northeast, and political issues will be discussed separately to seek a solution quickly.</p>
<p>[US News Service, Northern Peiping, 27th] Regarding the dispatch of executive teams to the Northeast by the Mediation Executive Headquarters, the Mediation Executive Headquarters here has also issued a public announcement. If the weather is good, the executive teams will depart on Friday. The work locations have not yet been announced. A more detailed report on the tasks of the executive teams sent to the Northeast will be released within days. The American personnel to be sent to the Northeast have already been decided, including Colonel Doteloder, director of the Second Executive Team who previously worked in Chifeng; Colonel Guley; Colonel Davenport; Colonel Barber; Colonel Tanleyk; and Alabama, director of the Fifth Executive Team who previously worked in Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Northern Peiping, 27th] The locations to which the executive teams for stopping conflicts in the Northeast will be sent are generally speculated to be Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, and the border between the Northeast and Rehe. It is said that the Communist army has been reinforcing the Northeast from there.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin Team Arrives in Haimen for Inspection; To Proceed to Northern Jiangsu Early Next Month; North China Transportation and Postal Government Needs Efforts to Recover</h3>
<p>[Our Nanking Dispatch, 27th] Military news: Lieutenant Colonel Dunk, the American representative of the Military Mediation Department's Huaiyin Team; Xiao Fengqi, the government representative; and Han Nianlong, the Communist representative, arrived in Haimen today to inspect the actual situation of the troops stationed on both sides of the conflict zone near Lingdianwei, sixty li from the city. If it is not necessary to go to Qidong for investigation, they can proceed to Yangzhou, Taixian, Shaobo, Qintong, and other places early next month. The commanders of the 25th Army of the National Army and the local government in Yangzhou and Taizhou are preparing to welcome them. Gentry and merchants from various counties and towns in Northern Jiangsu have been flocking to Yangzhou since yesterday to await their arrival.</p>
<p>[Our Nanking Dispatch, 27th] Zhenjiang News: Among the four agreements established by the Military Mediation Department's Huaiyin Team in Nantong, the third one regarding the use of legal tender in the Communist-occupied areas of Jiangsu is extremely important. This is because the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu forces the people to use anti-Japanese currency in its occupied areas and suppresses the value of legal tender to an equivalent exchange rate of thirty-three to thirty-five yuan of legal tender for each yuan of anti-Japanese currency. It also severs postal rights and unauthorizedly prints stamps, and restricts and obstructs remittances from merchants in Northern Jiangsu with various harsh measures, almost leaving the families of those engaged in various jobs outside of the fifteen counties of Northern Jiangsu to starve to death. Students from various counties in Northern Jiangsu studying in Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou have mostly dropped out of school and become wandering orphans due to the cutoff of financial support. People from Northern Jiangsu in Zhenjiang are eagerly hoping that the Huaiyin Team will urge the Communist army to faithfully fulfill its promise of using legal tender and hope that a practical and easily implementable agreement will be established as soon as possible on the issues of "unified postal rights" and "open exchange."</p>
<p>[Our Northern Peiping Dispatch, 27th] Behind the optimistic attitude of the Executive Headquarters towards the restoration of transportation, there are actually some difficulties. Today, a transportation industry insider frankly pointed out to reporters that the restoration of transportation requires all parties to be open and honest and make their best efforts. Speaking of the achievements in restoring transportation in the past month, since the issuance of Executive Headquarters Order No. 4, apart from the restoration of a small section from Fengjiakou to Botou on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, nothing has been achieved in other counties under the jurisdiction of the Peiping-Tianjin area. In terms of telecommunications, more than 1,400 kilometers have been restored, but more than 1,500 kilometers have not been repaired due to obstacles to construction. In terms of postal service, it has not returned to normal. The government representatives of the Executive Headquarters had previously proposed several principles for restoring the normal state of postal service based on the ceasefire agreement, namely unified personnel, unified management, no unauthorized issuance of stamps, and restoration of the original postal routes. The Communist representatives have not yet responded to this. Furthermore, the Communist side has been quite active in repairing railways in its controlled areas recently, automatically building the Ping-Sui Railway towards Qinglongqiao and automatically repairing the Jiaoji Railway eastward from Zhangdian. Transportation industry insiders speculate that the Communist side's move is to obtain joint management rights.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Northern Peiping, 27th] It is learned that the Gaomi Team dispatched by the Railway Management Section of the Executive Headquarters has made no progress in its work so far. Chen Lu, the government section chief of the section, Geng Biao, the Communist section chief, and Hill, the American section chief, have decided that if the weather improves on the 28th, they will take a special plane to Qingdao and then to Gaomi for inspection and provide on-site instructions to ensure the smooth progress of the road restoration work. According to news from Jinan, when the Jiaoji Railway was being built east of Zhangdian to Xindian, the Communist army came out to stop it, and the road construction project has been suspended.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to news from Shijiazhuang, the road construction survey team was blocked from advancing when it reached Gaoyi. It is said that the area north of Gaoyi belongs to the Southern Hebei Military Region of the Communist Party, while the area south belongs to the Taihang Military Region. The team has repeatedly retreated from Gaoyi to Yuanshi to wait for negotiations. The route between Yuanshi and Gaoyi is expected to start construction within days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th] After arriving in Laiyuan, the Military Mediation Department's Taiyuan Team convened a meeting of local military leaders from both sides on the 25th and has agreed on measures to stop the conflict.</p>
<h3>Wartime Civil Servants Cannot Be Both Loyal and Filial</h3>
<p>The National Government Promulgates Commendation Measures</p>
<p>[Our Nanking Dispatch, 27th] In consideration of the fact that wartime civil servants whose direct ascendants died in the occupied areas were unable to attend the funeral, the National Government has promulgated measures for applying for commendation. They can apply for an inscription from the National Government, stamped with the great seal of "Royal Honor," to show that loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fulfilled, so as to commend them. The application procedure is for the party concerned to submit a report to the National Government's Civil Service Office through the agency where they work.

In fact, personnel from the central party, government, and military agencies have been going to Beijing in batches. Among the personnel from the central agencies returning to the capital, the military agencies are proceeding the fastest.

<h3>Northeast Headquarters Establishes Committee to Unify the Takeover of Enemy and Puppet Industries; Must Eliminate Past Bad Phenomena</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 27th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters, attaches great importance to the takeover of enemy and puppet enterprises and assets in the Northeast. He specially established the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise Assets Unified Takeover Committee in the headquarters a few days ago. The key points of its mission are to ensure that the materials taken over are strictly guarded and that the production enterprises taken over are not allowed to be suspended, and to eliminate the bad phenomena of past takeovers in various places. The committee has now been formally established, with Xiong Shihui serving as the chairman and Zhang Jia'ao serving as the vice chairman. It has two departments, a secretariat and a supervisory office, and fifteen groups: military administration, finance, finance, education, transportation, economy, society, grain administration, agriculture and forestry, land administration, water conservancy, health, justice, propaganda, and relief. Ma Yi serves as the chief secretary, and Feng Xi serves as the director of the supervisory office. Special commissioners from various central ministries and commissions serve as the heads of each group to uniformly handle the takeover, custody, and disposal of assets in each province and city (municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan) and to establish branch committees in counties and cities. All chairmen of branch committees are served by the chairmen of each province, the mayors of special municipalities, and the mayors of each county and city respectively, in order to promote the smooth progress of the work.</p>
<h3>Order in Shenyang Gradually Restored; Dong Wenqi Talks About Future Work; Focus on Hygiene, Improving Transportation, Reviving Education, Rebuilding Industry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 26th] Mayor Dong Wenqi of Shenyang returned to Shenyang by plane on the 26th at noon after completing his work in Jinzhou.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the National Army formally took over the defense of Shenyang, the order here has been greatly stabilized. Our reporter specially visited Mayor Dong Wenqi. The following is a summary of the questions and answers:</p>
<p>(Question) People in Guan Nei are most concerned about the two issues of public security and people's livelihood in Shenyang. What is the situation of public security in Shenyang recently?</p>
<p>(Answer) Before the Soviet army began to withdraw and the National Army had not yet taken over the defense, there was a slight chaos in the city. At that time, there were three fires. After the National Army entered the city on the morning of the 13th, the order gradually restored. After the formal establishment of the Shenyang Garrison Headquarters, petty thieves have mostly disappeared, and the people's hearts are increasingly stable. At present, the local armed forces in Shenyang include the security team and the administrative police, with a total of several thousand people. After reorganization, the quality is still good.</p>
<p>(Question) Prices in Shenyang are rising day by day, and people's livelihood is difficult. What are the countermeasures of the municipal government?</p>
<p>(Answer) The reason for the recent price increase in Shenyang is mainly that after the Soviet army withdrew, the citizens' confidence in the military tickets issued in the past has decreased. Those who hold military tickets are rushing to throw them out in exchange for materials, so it is not easy to see circulating currency on the market recently, and the citizens cherish it very much. For now, in addition to continuing to use military tickets and circulating currency at an equivalent value in Shenyang in accordance with the announcement of the Economic and Financial Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, we urgently hope that the Ministry of Finance can determine a solution as soon as possible to stabilize the people's hearts. At the same time, restoring transportation and smoothing the source of materials can naturally reduce prices, because the nature of the price problem in Shenyang is very different from that of the ports in Guan Nei.</p>
<p>(Question) Can the mayor tell us about the central work of Shenyang's municipal administration in the future?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are four main tasks for the municipal administration in the future: (1) Public health issues. During the seven months before the takeover of Shenyang, the municipal administration was abandoned, and no one paid attention to cleanliness. Mountains of garbage accumulated everywhere in the city. The municipal government launched a clean-up campaign last month. After half a month of efforts, most of the city's garbage has been removed, and it will continue to be promoted to eliminate garbage and reduce diseases. (2) Urban transportation issues. The urban area of Shenyang covers 252 square kilometers, with a population of 2,166,000. Therefore, transportation is extremely important. There used to be more than 50 trams, but now there are only more than 10 left. We are speeding up the repair of old cars, but the main problem is the restoration of electricity. The electricity used by Pan City factories and other places relies on the high-voltage electricity from the Songhua River area. Since the Communist army destroyed the Dongling transformer station, the power supply has been cut off recently, and Shenyang's trams and tap water have been suspended as a result. We are now actively rushing to repair the large power plant of the former Northeast Arsenal, which can be restored in twenty days at the earliest. In addition, we plan to add buses to facilitate urban transportation. (3) Education issues. There are currently 36 elementary schools in Shenyang that have started classes, and the rest are being actively reorganized and can continue to open. However, the most lacking thing at present is teachers. We are training teachers from various schools on the one hand and establishing normal schools on the other hand to create complete teachers. (4) Factory resumption issues. There are a total of 4,570 factories in Shenyang, large and small, and 940 with more than 100 workers, accounting for 60% of the entire Northeast industry. There are a total of 300,000 workers. Therefore, in order to supply the needs of the people and solve the unemployment of workers, factory resumption is a matter of urgency. The recovery of heavy industry is more difficult, and civil industry is easier. If the grain mill machinery is pieced together, 20% of the factories can still be started. We hope that the competent departments can quickly send people here to preside over it.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Still Constantly Attacking Near Liaoyang and Fushun</h3>
<p>Siping Street Factories Have Been Forcibly Occupied</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 27th] After the National Army took over Liaoyang, Fushun, and other cities, it is still suffering constant attacks from the Communist army. In the area within 15 li around Liaoyang and in the northeast area of Fushun, the Communist army launched fierce attacks on the National Army several times on the 23rd and 24th, but all failed. The National Army, which is heading north from Tieling to take over the area withdrawn by the Soviet army, is currently being obstructed by the fierce attacks of the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the Communist army captured Siping Street, the seat of the Liaobei Provincial Government, they unauthorizedly established provincial, municipal, county, and district administrations, appointed provincial governors, forcibly occupied factories, plundered the people's property, and forced citizens to hold meetings, requiring them to express their welcome to the Communist army, otherwise they would be arrested. More than 100 citizens are currently missing.</p>
<h3>Tense Atmosphere Still in Changchun; Handover of Defense Said to Have Clear Decision Soon; Our Parachute Troops Waiting for Orders in Jinzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 26th] The tense atmosphere in recent days seems to be gradually easing, and rumors have been denied by facts. Local people habitually say "Changchun is a blessed land." It seems that in the past fifty years, international forces have competed in this area, and Changchun has uniquely possessed the magic of "turning danger into safety." However, in fact, some kind of danger still exists. Three machine guns were found on a firewood cart entering the city a few days ago. Today, 23 Soviet tanks passed through the main street, climbed into the station, and drove elsewhere. The city police and security forces have also set up defenses in each residence. Therefore, the general phenomenon indicates that under the surface of relaxation, there is "tension" lurking. Today, Dong Yanping, the head of our important affairs delegation, met with Soviet Chief of Staff Trotsenko. The content is unknown, but the current problem is when will the Soviet army withdraw from Changchun, and when will the National Army arrive in Changchun. In other words, there should be a clear decision on the handover and takeover of Changchun. Because the handover in the style of Shenyang should belong to the past, and the handover and takeover from now on, starting from Changchun, should have a new method. This problem is not only a matter of great concern to the people of Changchun, but also to the people of Harbin and other places in the Northeast. Also, a plane came today and transported a batch of takeover personnel.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] Sandbags have been placed in front of the gates of various military agencies on our side here, and defensive works are being rushed to be built around the buildings. The security forces are also checking vehicles in various key areas, and the atmosphere has become tense again. However, the order in the city is still as quiet as usual.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 27th] Today's newspapers here reported that a batch of well-equipped parachute troops of the National Army are waiting for orders in Jinzhou, ready to take over the areas withdrawn by the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Dong Yanping, Liu Handong, etc., Fly to Jinzhou to See Xiong Shihui</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] Dong Yanping flew to Jinzhou by special plane this afternoon to report important matters to Director Xiong. He said that a plane would return to Changchun in the afternoon, otherwise it would return on the 28th. He brought with him the records of yesterday's talks with the Soviet side. Also, Liu Handong, chairman of Liaobei, and Secretary-General Xu and other five people who were released and came to Changchun last night flew back on the same plane with Dong today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Vice Foreign Minister Liu Kai declared that the Soviet Union recently proposed that the Soviet army in the Northeast completely withdraw before the end of April. China has replied, stating that it can agree. An agreement in principle has been reached with the Soviet side regarding the National Army's use of the China Changchun Railway, and detailed measures are now being considered. The situation between China and the Soviet Union in the Northeast has eased, "but no one can say that this situation is on a very solid foundation." Negotiations are underway to hand over the defense of each city and town from the Soviet army to the National Army. The partial negotiations on economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in the Northeast have been suspended since mid-February. When asked if negotiations would resume after the Soviet army had completely withdrawn, Vice Minister Liu replied, "I have no comment to offer."</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] According to today's news, 10,000 Communist troops occupied Siping Street on the 16th of this month. The vanguard of the government army is now approaching the city and fighting the Communist army around the city. The news confirms that the government army entered Fushun on the 24th of this month. It is also rumored that the Communist army has opened a bank in Faku, north of Shenyang, and issued its own paper money.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] According to personnel from the Liaobei Provincial Government who were released from Siping and returned, the Communist army that captured Siping this time is the so-called "Northeast Security Army," which also has the designation "New Fourth Army" and is under the jurisdiction of the "Liaoxi Military Region." Its lower-level cadres mostly come from various places in Guan Nei. Wei Zhu, the political commissar of the Liaoxi Military Region, holds the military and political power in the area. According to the three major factions of the Communist army in the Northeast, one is the "Northeast Security Army," commonly known as the "Shui Balu," which came by water. Another is the "Northeast People's Self-Government Army," commonly known as the "Tu Balu," but its cadres also mostly come from Yan'an, and its base is in the eastern area. In addition, there is also the "Northeast People's Self-Defense Army," whose base is in the northern Manchuria area.</p>
<h3>Peiping Accepts Small Denomination US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Northern Peiping, 27th] The Peiping branch of the Central Bank will start accepting small denomination US dollars and US dollar bonds and coupons worth less than 20 yuan from today. The exchange rate is 1,920 yuan in national currency per US dollar.</p>
<h3>Part of Surplus Grain from Sichuan Province to Be Shipped to Hunan Province for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Nanking Dispatch, 27th] Chongqing News: Government news, the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, and Food have sent personnel to inspect the Hunan disaster. In addition to instructing the Relief and Relief Administration to rush a large amount of flour to urgently relieve the disaster, the government will ship a part of the surplus grain from Sichuan Province from eastern Sichuan to Changde in western Hunan and then to the disaster area for relief. It will also allocate funds to the Hunan Provincial Government and the Yuehan and Xianggui Railways to properly draft a work-for-relief plan for approval. After Siamese rice arrives in Hunan more smoothly, it is also planned to purchase 50,000 tons, which will be transferred from the Yuehan Railway to Changsha, Hengyang, and other places for adjustment.</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Division Commander Kondo Detained and Escorted to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Okamura Yasuji to Be Arrested Soon</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 27th] Japanese war criminal Kondo Shinpachi, Lieutenant General and commander of the 130th Division of the Japanese Army, was detained and escorted here from Shunde yesterday. Also, Japanese prisoners Matsuguchi Shigeharu, Tanaka Hisaichi, and others, feeling the great tolerance of the Chinese people, have requested to stay in China to serve, and are now awaiting a decision from the Headquarters.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanking, 27th] Okamura Yasuji, the former commander of the Japanese army stationed in China, has been suffering from a tongue disease for the past three months and has been unable to speak. General He Yingqin revealed a few weeks ago that Okamura is one of the important war criminals and will be arrested immediately after he has completed his work of assisting in the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Assembly of Participating Political Councilors' Separate Review Meetings</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Receives Participating Political Councilors</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The current session of the Participating Political Council has held twelve meetings. The government's policy report has been completed.

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Chairman Chiang hosted a tea party this afternoon to receive participating political councilors.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 27th] Food Minister Xu Kan, yesterday at the Participating Political Council, condemned the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for providing less supplies to China than to Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, and for not allowing Siamese rice to be transported to China. He stated: UNRRA had promised to provide China with 290,000 tons of rice and 750,000 tons of wheat and flour in the first half of this year. However, in January, China only received 15,000 tons of rice. Mr. Xu continued, China has urged Ambassador Wei Tao-ming in the United States to find ways to purchase 360,000 bags of American and Canadian flour, 200,000 tons of Siamese rice, and 300,000 tons of American and Canadian wheat.</p>
<h3>General Jones Announces in Peiping: U.S. Troops Will Not Be Sent to the Northeast; General Wedemeyer Scheduled to Go to Nanking Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 26th] General Jones, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the Peiping area, stated: Although it has been officially announced that Soviet troops will complete their withdrawal by the end of April, the U.S. Marines will generally not be sent to the Northeast. When a reporter asked if the U.S. Marines might go to the Northeast to protect the railways, Jones replied: Currently, the U.S. Marines are protecting the Peiping, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao railways, and the number of personnel is still insufficient. Another reporter asked if the U.S. Marines would be called to Huludao to assist in defense work. Jones answered with a "no."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanking, 27th] General Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater, is scheduled to go to Nanking on Thursday before leaving Shanghai for the United States on April 1st, to confer with Major General McClure, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] It is reported that the Overseas Chinese Rehabilitation and Relief Administration has prepared transportation in Kunming and will soon begin transportation. Returning overseas Chinese are packed and ready to depart, but the subsidies approved by the Executive Yuan have not yet been issued, preventing them from starting their journey. Most of them are Burmese overseas Chinese, but the rainy season will soon arrive in that area, making travel difficult. If they do not depart quickly, more difficulties will arise. Yesterday, representatives specially appointed by the overseas Chinese appealed to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting them to write to the Executive Yuan to expedite the allocation of subsidies so that they can go abroad in time.</p>

<h3>Soviet Representative Threatens to Withdraw from Meeting; Security Council Reaches Stalemate; Truman Personally Sends Letter to Stalin; Iranian Prime Minister Denies Agreement with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Within hours, the Security Council will reconvene to hear the report of the Tripartite Committee established yesterday. Whether the Security Council will accept the Soviet Union's request to postpone the Iranian issue until April 10th will be revealed. According to Soviet representative Gromyko, if the General Assembly discusses the Iranian issue before April 10th, the Soviet Union will withdraw from the meeting. Therefore, the meeting has reached a serious impasse. To save this crisis, President Truman has personally sent a letter to Stalin, which is being carried by the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, who will arrive in Moscow tomorrow. The situation is expected to change dramatically. At the same time, British representative Cadogan has telegraphed London for new solutions to cope with the crisis.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: French representative Parodi, attending the Security Council, received orders from the French government today to assume the position of mediator on the Iranian issue, and to strive to defend the Atlantic Charter and safeguard the sovereignty of small countries.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 27th Broadcast: The Iranian Prime Minister today denied that he had reached a new agreement with the Soviet Union regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iranian territory. This statement is quite credible because Iran has consistently disagreed with the Security Council's postponement of the Iranian issue. Observers believe that the Soviet Union's reasons for requesting a postponement are twofold: (1) Negotiations on Iranian oil production may be nearing completion before April 10th; (2) The reorganization of the Iranian government and the status of Azerbaijan may also be determined by then.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 26th] Today's meeting of the United Nations Security Council, by a vote of nine to two, accepted the proposal of the United States and the United Kingdom, deciding to include the Soviet-Iranian case as item four on the agenda. Aligned with the United States and the United Kingdom were China, Australia, Mexico, Egypt, the Netherlands, France, and Brazil, with only Poland opposing. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi, in his capacity as President of the Council, did not vote. After Soviet representative Gromyko's strong struggle failed, he suggested postponing the case for discussion until April 10th. Gromyko declared that he could not attend the Security Council meeting to discuss the Iranian complaint. It is unclear whether this statement means that he will withdraw if the Council rejects his proposal for postponement, or whether he has not yet received instructions from Moscow authorizing him to participate in the discussion at this time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 27th] This agency has learned from authoritative sources: Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Ala, has been granted full powers by the Iranian government to protest at today's Security Council meeting against the continued occupation of northern Iran by Soviet troops and interference in Iran's internal affairs. Soviet representative Gromyko expressed doubt at yesterday's Council meeting as to whether Ambassador Ala had the right to speak on behalf of the Iranian government. A spokesman for the Iranian side specifically stated that Ambassador Ala has maintained constant contact with the Tehran government in the past few days, and the Iranian government instructed him to change or withdraw the protest he submitted to the Security Council based on instructions received on March 15th. A telegram received here today from Tehran confirms that the Soviet and Iranian governments have not reached an agreement to resolve the dispute.</p>
<h3>Military Staff Committee Meeting; Shang Zhen Elected as Chairman; First Meeting Lasts Only Ten Minutes; Britain and the United States Do Not Intend to Raise the Issue of Atomic Bombs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Special Dispatch] General Shang Zhen, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee meeting, was elected as Chairman of the meeting at the first meeting held here today. Soviet representative General Vasilyev relinquished his candidacy and supported General Shang Zhen's election. His term as Chairman will expire on April 30th, which differs from the situation in the United Nations Security Council, where the Chairman is rotated among representatives in alphabetical order based on the country's name. The Chairman of the Military Staff Committee is determined based on seniority. It is generally recognized that General Shang Zhen has the highest seniority among the representatives from the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, having served in the military for 25 years. The first meeting held today lasted only ten minutes. Meetings will continue tomorrow to discuss the reports submitted by various subcommittees on plans to organize an international peacekeeping force. The work of the Military Staff Committee meeting is extremely confidential. The participating representatives all refuse to disclose which subcommittee was assigned or what issues were discussed. According to U.S. representative General Kenney, the meeting will discuss various defense issues, and the issue of atomic bombs will also be discussed if raised. It is heard that he said: Britain will not raise the issue of atomic bombs as a topic for discussion in the meeting, but if other countries raise it, it is impossible to prevent it. General Kenney further denied the recent rumor that the Military Staff Committee has estimated that the number of troops to be dispatched by the Security Council is approximately two million.</p>

During interrogation by U.S. Commissioner Lee Dickey, Lers repeatedly shouted, "I have nothing to say." Lers then requested to see the Soviet Consul, but he remains in custody for failing to pay a $25,000 bail. Lers is a graduate of the Soviet Naval Academy and came to the United States four years ago. After the end of the war, he served as the Chairman of the Soviet Purchasing Commission in Seattle. The FBI has been monitoring his activities for several months. He was arrested while attempting to return to the Soviet Union on a Soviet ship in Portland. He will be prosecuted for engaging in espionage activities and will be interrogated within a few days.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai was officially established today and is about to convene meetings to discuss and resolve various matters concerning the city's municipal affairs that need to be established or reformed. These resolutions will then be submitted to the municipal authorities for implementation. The establishment of this council is of great historical significance. The Municipal Council is termed "provisional" because its members are constrained by objective circumstances and cannot be directly elected by the people. Currently, the municipal authorities are actively preparing for the election of municipal councilors. Before the elected councilors are produced, this provisional council will serve as a transition. This period is not expected to be too long. Although the members of this Provisional Municipal Council are appointed by the government, the selected individuals come from various sectors including finance, commerce, public opinion, education, and culture. They are all outstanding individuals of the time and are worthy of public expectation. Therefore, even though this Provisional Municipal Council is not directly elected by the citizens, it can fully represent the public opinion of the people of Shanghai. Shanghai is China's premier city. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the lost territories were recovered. The original special areas, such as the former "French Concession" and "International Settlement," no longer exist. The unification of Shanghai's municipal administration was achieved through the courageous efforts of our soldiers and the leadership of Chairman Chiang. The establishment of the Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai coincides with this historical moment, and its significance is profound.</p>
<p>Municipal measures are closely related to the people's lives. In our country, local officials are often referred to as "officials close to the people" or "parents of the people," highlighting their closeness to the people. Whether municipal measures are appropriate has the most direct impact on the people. Therefore, municipal measures must be carefully considered. Shanghai is an international city, and it also had "concessions" in the past. Therefore, the measures taken in Shanghai's municipal administration are of great concern to international observers. Whether the municipal measures are appropriate not only affects the people of the city but also affects international perceptions. Now that the Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai has been established in Shanghai, we will briefly discuss the current municipal administration, hoping it can be adopted by the Provisional Municipal Council, and also to offer congratulations.</p>
<p>(1) Establishing a Shanghai Municipal Financial System: Since the recovery of Shanghai, municipal revenue has been insufficient to cover expenses. According to news reports, the city's revenue shortfall for February this year exceeded 60 million yuan. Given the extraordinary circumstances, the failure of the city's finances to get on track was an unavoidable phenomenon at the time. However, now that the nation is at a pivotal moment of national construction, and Shanghai's recovery has been over seven months, municipal construction is an integral part of national construction and should seize the opportunity to move forward. But municipal construction requires funds, and the establishment of a municipal financial system is paramount. It is evident that the city's finances are unsound and unreasonable when such a large city relies primarily on revenue from entertainment and banquet taxes. China's financial system is divided into central and local levels. During the war, to concentrate resources for combat, most tax revenues were collected by the central government, leading to the depletion of local tax revenues. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the division of the financial systems between the central and local governments should be readjusted. Entertainment and banquet taxes are general consumption taxes. The wealth of citizens varies greatly, and the burden is the same, which violates the principle of "taxation according to ability." American soldiers in Shanghai previously called for exemption from such taxes, which was approved by the mayor. After a long period of war, the people need to recuperate. Even if entertainment and banquet taxes cannot be abolished, they should be reduced to avoid disturbing the people. To broaden the tax base, taxes should be levied equally and directly on companies, factories, and firms that benefit the most from municipal services, so that the focus of municipal finance gradually shifts from consumption taxes and license taxes to direct taxes, thereby establishing a sound municipal financial system.</p>
<p>(2) Stabilizing the Livelihood of the People of Shanghai: Shanghai is the center of our industry and commerce, with a population of five million. Since the recovery, many factories have shut down, and unemployment has soared. Alternatively, labor unrest has erupted, and prices have skyrocketed, leading to instability in people's livelihoods. Although the reasons are complex and beyond the control of municipal authorities, the municipal authorities should do everything possible to stabilize the livelihoods of citizens. In the past seven months, the measures taken by the municipal authorities that directly affected the lives of Shanghai citizens have often been more restrictive than supportive. A single prohibition order can affect the lives of millions of people. At this difficult time, the municipal authorities have not only failed to create more opportunities for citizens but have also disrupted existing livelihoods with restrictions. The people of Shanghai, under the tyranny of the enemy and puppets, looked forward to the return of the national army, but what they have received since the recovery has not been warmth but hardship. This has created a very unwise impression among the general public. Moreover, one of the most absurd things is that after Paris and Tokyo abolished the public prostitution system, the Shanghai municipal authorities are still planning to establish a public prostitution system in Shanghai. This is not only a disgrace to Shanghai but also to the whole of China. In order to maintain Shanghai's reputation and China's national dignity, we cannot allow the establishment of a public prostitution system or the demarcation of "red-light districts" in Shanghai. Now that the Provisional Municipal Council of Shanghai has been established, we hope that the council members can urge the municipal authorities to do more to support the stability of the lives of Shanghai citizens from a proactive perspective and issue fewer prohibitions that restrict or exploit the basic freedoms of the people.</p>
<p>(3) Establishing a Shanghai Municipal Transportation System: Shanghai is our country's largest city. Modern cities must have a perfect transportation system. New York and London have subways that extend in all directions, as well as buses and trams running throughout the city. Both London and New York have dedicated transportation agencies to oversee these matters. In the past, due to the existence of "concessions" in Shanghai, each acted independently, so a complete municipal transportation system has not yet been established. Since the recovery, the Shanghai municipal authorities have been actively adjusting the existing structure. According to yesterday's news in this newspaper, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is planning to systematically reorganize the traffic routes of the city's trams, trolleybuses, and public buses. The main lines will be served by trams and trolleybuses, and branch lines will be served by public buses. However, in modern urban transportation, trams are no longer suitable due to frequent road traffic. The main transportation lines in London, New York, and even Paris and Moscow rely on subways. Even Tokyo has subway transportation. For the future prosperity of Shanghai, it seems that we should abandon trams and plan for a subway network. In terms of the current situation, public buses have not yet fully resumed service, leading to overcrowded trams, which urgently needs to be improved. Actively establishing a Shanghai transportation system is essential to restoring Shanghai's prosperity.</p>
<h3>A Smart and Beautiful Italian Girl - Female Spy Bianca (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng in Guangzhou for This Newspaper</p>
<p>She said: Her beauty has caused many entanglements; many people hate her because they cannot get her love.</p>
<p>As for her husband, Mr. Tan, he was originally a colonel and battalion commander of the New First Army's search battalion, a native of Xinhui, Guangdong, and is indeed in Guangzhou now. He believes that Bianca's arrest is "caused by her beauty." He does not believe that Bianca is a spy. He said: In 1938, he took Bianca and two children to Rome and returned to China. He arranged for Bianca to live in Duyun, Guizhou, where she lived for more than two years. Because of the bombing by enemy planes, she moved to Guilin. In Guilin, she was still threatened by enemy planes, so he sent her to Hong Kong again. When she arrived in Hong Kong, the European war had already broken out, and the British government expelled Bianca, so she went to Shanghai. From then on, he could no longer communicate with Bianca. Later, she went to Guangzhou and Hong Kong, Guangzhou to look for her husband. At that time, she met Simon. Soon, she received the news that her husband had died in battle in Burma. For the sake of life and for the sake of her children, she had to live with Simon. When Japan was about to surrender, she returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou for her child's illness. After the war ended, she learned from an American major who had fought with her husband in Burma that her husband had returned to Guangzhou. She was very happy and returned to Guangzhou on November 10th last year. However, she still could not find her husband after arriving in Guangzhou, and the hotel was too crowded to find a room, so she still went to live with Simon in Shamian. However, at that time, she had been suspected by the authorities of being a spy and had been under surveillance for a long time. This Colonel Tan said the above words with great emotion. Finally, he also put forward several reasons to defend her: (1) She is the mother of five children, and she is of noble birth. She does not need to act as a spy. (2) Her travels between Guangdong and Shanghai were on civil aviation planes, which were applied for in accordance with proper procedures from the Japanese military. (3) The reason why she had dealings with the Japanese was purely for applying for a passport. The Japanese delayed her because they found her beautiful. (4) She was detained by the Japanese four times because she was the wife of a Chongqing military officer and was suspected of being a Chongqing spy. This shows that she had no relationship with the Japanese. (5) She lived with Simon purely out of necessity for life. (6) Witnesses who can be found in Guangzhou include the secretary of the French Consulate and a Japanese person. However, there are more witnesses in Shanghai who can prove that she is a good person.</p>
<p>After Colonel Tan defended Bianca in this way, the case became more complicated. Bianca also repeatedly said that she was causing trouble because of her beauty, which could easily turn this espionage case into a scandal. Is Bianca really a female spy? Everyone can't help but wonder.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 19th, the Camp sent Colonel Tang Yanguang, director of the war criminal investigation team, and an interpreter to the hospital to conduct an informal interrogation of Bianca.</p>
<p>"What are the 14 million yuan of national currency that you brought to Guangzhou for?" Colonel Tang began to ask.</p>
<p>"This money was entrusted to me by a friend, Mr. Tang, in Shanghai to buy US dollars to make a profit. Later, I exchanged it for 11,200 US dollars. Except for the 5,000 yuan that was lost, the remaining 6,200 US dollars have been transferred back by my husband," Bianca replied.</p>
<p>"How did you support your family in Shanghai during the war?" Colonel Tang asked again.</p>
<p>"Simon paid for it! Because she loved my beauty, she provided for me." She sent a flirtatious glance to the serious Colonel Tang.</p>
<p>"When were you in Room 407 of the Kyoto Hotel in Shanghai, and what Japanese people did you have dealings with? What are their names? Do you also know a Chinese man named Mr. Dong?"</p>
<p>"I know Mr. Dong, but I have forgotten the names of the Japanese people."</p>
<p>"When did you live with Simon, and did you cooperate in anything?"</p>
<p>"In 1942, we did not cooperate in any business, except for entertainment. I like sleeping the most."</p>
<p>"Do you know a lot of Japanese people? Otherwise, how could you travel between Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Bay by plane and warship during the war?"</p>
<p>"No, traveling to various places by boat and plane was done in accordance with proper procedures."</p>
<p>"Was it very convenient for you to enter and exit Saito's office, and did you do so many times?"</p>
<p>"He was in charge of maritime affairs, so I often went to his office to apply for a passport."</p>
<p>"What is your nationality?"</p>
<p>"Italian. I married a Chinese man and am now Chinese."</p>
<p>When Bianca answered Colonel Tang's questions, she was constantly expressing herself, sometimes smiling and looking at Colonel Tang flirtatiously. But sometimes she frowned deeply. In this short period of time, she cried four times. Finally, Colonel Tang asked her to sign a statement admitting that she had said, "I married a Chinese man and am of Chinese nationality," and "All my living expenses at that time were paid for by Simon." Then Colonel Tang left.</p>
<p>The reporter followed Colonel Tang out of Boji Hospital and had a long conversation. According to him, acting and expressing oneself are common tricks of female spies. They are used to seeing such things. She has told reporters from various newspapers that she is causing trouble because of her beauty, which is likely to be a deliberate attempt to shift people's attention. In fact, this matter is not so simple and is quite complicated. The Camp has now collected a lot of information about this female spy case and will publish it after further study.</p>
<p>The reporter also asked Colonel Tang about the points that Colonel Tan made to defend Bianca. His reply was: It is true that Tan and Bianca were married, but they are divorced. They divorced in Shanghai, and the evidence is already in our hands. However, they have not mentioned their divorce. If they were indeed divorced during the war, then Tan would naturally not know about Bianca's actions after 1941, and he should not defend her. As for saying that she is of noble birth and does not need to be a spy, this is also not a sufficient basis. We all know that the two most famous female spies in the world are of noble birth. Furthermore, she took civil aviation planes between Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Bay during the war. You think, the enemy's transportation was completely controlled during the war. If she didn't have a lot of Japanese connections, it wouldn't have been so easy to travel. It is also said that because of her beauty, many people hate her because they cannot get her love. This is clearly an attempt to shift the matter to a love triangle. If we really believe this statement, then we are completely wrong. In fact, the fact that she and Simon once lived together is secondary. The key is still the issue of her past dealings with important Japanese figures!</p>
<p>Colonel Tang denied Colonel Tan's defense of Bianca. He seemed to have a clear idea of the case, but he was not at liberty to say more until it was time to publish it.</p>
<p>It was getting late, and the reporter parted ways with Colonel Tang.</p>
<p>The smart and beautiful Bianca is still sleeping quietly in Boji Hospital. I believe that if she is a good person, she will still be very quiet now; but if she is really a Japanese spy, then her shackles have not been removed, and these shackles will at least be on her soul.</p>

Upon hearing this, we were both astonished and dismayed. Our county is located in a dangerous area by the river, with mostly poor land, and its people are loyal and righteous, with many virtuous and upright scholars. As a result, we were regarded as a poisonous target by the enemy and puppets, and were severely destroyed. Coupled with the recent disasters of locusts and moths, the entire county has suffered from both man-made and natural disasters. Fortunately, upon victory, our scholars and people all raised their heads and celebrated in the fields, believing that the government would surely show compassion. Now, with continuous rain and signs of disaster already forming, we are planning to ask the authorities for assistance and provide relief as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the higher authorities ordered harsh demands, how can the people be at peace? Although our county is known as a rice-producing area, when calculated based on the population and land area, even with annual bumper harvests, it is difficult to be self-sufficient, let alone after the enemy and puppets searched and looted, and barrenness occurred repeatedly. The authorities should show compassion and properly arrange for rehabilitation, so that we can slightly restore our vitality and build the great cause of the nation. Jianqin and others are representatives of our town and on behalf of the surrounding areas, we appeal and request that you have mercy on the remaining people and allow us to be exempt from military rice," and so on.

The full text is 5,000 words long, including nine points, to supplement the omissions of the Anglo-American financial agreement signed last November, so that the debts arising from the Lend-Lease Act are completely cleared. The United States will transfer all of its surplus army and navy property in Britain to Britain, including 672 Dakota transport aircraft, and lease another 671 of these aircraft to Britain. From the cessation of the Lend-Lease Act until the end of last December, the claims and debts arising from the mutual supply of materials between the two countries should be offset and cleared. After the end of last year, the exchange of materials should be paid in cash as a principle. According to this agreement, the United Kingdom non-military authorities shall acquire full ownership of the Lend-Lease items in their possession on September 2 last year, except for ships with a displacement of more than 100 tons, non-combat aircraft, and petroleum products. The British government shall be responsible for returning the property requested by the United States. If it wishes to transfer property to governments or colonial authorities outside the United Kingdom, it shall first seek the consent of the United States government. All surplus property of the United States Army and Navy in Britain shall be acquired by Britain, but the British government shall give the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration the opportunity to purchase surplus property at reasonable prices. Britain must also guarantee not to re-export surplus property back to the United States, and shall not discriminate against U.S. manufacturers. Britain may not export any weapons under the Lend-Lease Act without the consent of the United States.</p>

<h3>Fair-Priced Flour Continues to be Sold Yesterday Saw Resumption of Payment Collection - Each Bag Still Sells for Six Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The fair-priced flour sold by the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) resumed yesterday with the fifteen banks entrusted to collect payment for the flour having resumed accepting payment. It continues to be sold to the city at a price of six thousand yuan per bag. However, those waiting to make payments in front of the banks were extremely crowded, with the lines very long.</p>
<p>Payment Time - 3 PM to 5 PM</p>
<p>The reporter inquired with the person in charge of the CRRRA about the temporary suspension of the supply of fair-priced flour. It was reported that the Administration had long expressed its determination to sell fair-priced flour without restrictions and will do its best to achieve this goal, with no intention of stopping it. This time, the Administration did not suspend sales, it was because the banks temporarily stopped collecting payments because collecting payments for flour affected their normal business, which led to the temporary suspension of the supply of fair-priced flour. The time for collecting payments at each bank has now been adjusted to 3 PM to 5 PM daily (except Sundays). The newly set collection time is outside the business hours of each bank, which should not affect the business of each bank.</p>
<p>Preventing Malpractices - Limited to One Bag per Person</p>
<p>It was also reported that the Administration stipulated a limit of only one bag of flour per person to prevent "scalpers" from buying in large quantities for profit, preventing ordinary citizens from buying it. However, dealing with the activities of "scalpers" is proving difficult, and the Administration is now planning to introduce new measures to purchase flour to eliminate this malpractice. As for Director Jiang Tingfu of the CRRRA, he will return to the city in early April after attending the UNRRA food conference, at which time he will give a detailed report on the UNRRA's food allocation plan.</p>

<h3>Two Traitors Convicted and Sentenced - Zou Xiangzhi to Four Years, Zou Zhigao to Two and a Half Years, Song Guiren, Wang Yaoting, and Huang Zhongliang Await Sentencing</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Criminal Division of the Tilanqiao High Court held a collegiate panel yesterday afternoon and delivered judgments in two cases: (1) Zou Xiangzhi, 40 years old, from Nanjing, a watch shop owner, was charged with being a detective for the puppet police. He was convicted of treason, endangering the nation, and plotting against the country and was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights. (2) Zou Zhigao, from Shanghai, who served as a recommended technician in the General Affairs Section of the puppet Ministry of Justice, committed the same crimes as Zou Xiangzhi and was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. Zhang Qipin, whose judgment was originally scheduled for yesterday, was postponed because further investigation of evidence was deemed necessary, so the hearing will be reopened for debate. After the judgments were delivered, the court then heard two more cases: (1) Song Guiren, 41 years old, from Shandong, and Wang Yaoting, 54 years old, from Hebei, both of whom were staff members of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government's Nanshi Tax Collection Office. On February 27, 1945, they went to Teng Gongxing's roasted goods shop and various cake shops on Dajing Road and, on the pretext of not having prepared business ledgers, demanded bribes totaling over 20,000 puppet currency, which they divided equally. The case was uncovered by the puppet police and handed over to the court for prosecution. (2) Huang Zhongliang, originally a rice merchant, operated a shop in Minhang. In early January of 1933, when the puppet government implemented the "cleansing the countryside" policy in Minhang, Huang accepted an appointment from the puppet Shanghai County North Bridge District Office to serve as the director of the Minhang Public Sales Office. He organized patrol teams stationed at key water and land transportation points to intercept rice merchants and forcibly collect rice. On March 2 of the same year, a villager named Jiang Shunshan transported 65 loads of rice by boat back to his residence in Tangwan. The patrol team discovered this and brought him to the Minhang Public Sales Office, where the rice was confiscated. Huang was later promoted to manager of the office. The case was reported by the Jiangsu Province Investigation and Statistics Office. The debates in the above two cases have concluded, and the judgments will be delivered on the 3rd of next month.</p>

<p>The trial by the U.S. War Crimes Commission of the case of the pilots under General Doolittle who were killed in Shanghai has been ongoing for over ten days. The lawyer for the prosecution, Lieutenant Colonel Hartlein, and others, presented as final evidence to the court wills found near Tokyo. They were the hand-written wills of the three American pilots just before their execution. A passage from Lieutenant Homer's will read: "I am writing this without knowing what to say. They tell me I am going to be put to death, and I can hardly believe it. I only hope that as a prisoner of war, I will be buried after my death." Another letter stated: "My bombing of Tokyo was in obedience to military orders. As a member of the U.S. Air Force, I knew I was taking the greatest risks, but war is war." The other two also wrote letters to their relatives, the words extremely poignant. The Japanese never sent the letters to their families. The lawyers for the accused, including Sawada Shigeru, requested the presiding judge grant them time to prepare their arguments, so the case is set to be heard again on the morning of the 30th.</p>

<h3>Orphanage Housing Dispute - Chengming Academy Appeals</h3>
<p>Regarding the housing dispute at the Bethany Orphanage at No. 1933 Zhongshan Road, it was recorded in this newspaper on the 24th. Chengming College has claimed: "This college was originally named Zhengfeng College, and in September of the 29th year, it was ordered by the Ministry of Education to change its name to the current name. After December 8 of the 30th year, this college was forced by circumstances to relocate to Shangrao. After the victory, it was ordered to return. Unexpectedly, the original site and school buildings of this college on Jiaotong Road were used by Wang Zhenyun, son of the former president Wang Xishen, in May of the 32nd year in the name of his father who had died in July of the 31st year to sell them to Huang Zhongming, who then resold them to the Bethany Orphanage. This college believes that school property is involved and has filed a lawsuit according to the law. After the first-instance court judgment, an appeal is underway. As for the students moving into the original site, this college had already sent separate letters to the city police bureau and the Dachang branch for investigation and also obtained the consent of the orphanage. How can it be described as intrusion? Moreover, because of the continuous spring rains in the past ten days or so, the students were confined to two rooms, sleeping on the floor. Fearing dampness and illness, they recently sent a small number of benches and beds to the school. The students were in good order and never had any conflict with the orphanage. This college is quietly awaiting the protection of national law."</p>

<h3>Responding to Readers</h3>
<p>Yue Xueqiu asks: I married Dong Suying in the summer of the 31st year through friendship. We have been married for several years and had a son, who unfortunately died at the age of three. Due to unemployment for many years, I had no choice but to start a small business to make a living, which led to a very difficult life. At this time, Suying left with her belongings to return to her mother's home. Last September, Suying was due to give birth, and I accompanied her to the Chu Seng Hospital in the South City, where I had pre-registered her for admission. I personally delivered food every day. After a few days, I was unable to go due to illness, and when I went to the hospital, I learned that she had been taken back by her mother's family. She has not returned for several months. I recently heard that she has given away the newborn daughter and says she does not want to live together and demands a divorce! If I do not agree to a divorce, she requires a separation of at least one year. I would like to ask: (1) Can a unilateral request for divorce be legally established? (2) If the term expires, can she say that I abandoned her? (3) Do I have the right to interfere with her actions during the separation period?</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers: (1) One spouse requesting a divorce requires the other spouse to have one of the circumstances listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code in order to do so. (2) Although spouses are separated, their status and all relationships such as support still exist. (3) Both parties have agreed in writing to separate for one year, so they can only request to live together again after the term has expired.</p>

<h3>Police Raids and Prohibitions Result in Soaring Stock Market Black Market Prices, Unified C Bonds See a New High of 3,300 Yuan, Stock Market Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Public bonds are rising again, with Category C breaking through the 3,000 yuan mark immediately upon opening, reaching a high of 3,200 yuan. Some sellers appeared in the market, causing the price to retreat to 2,900 yuan, before returning to a little over 3,000 yuan at midday. As a result, Categories A and B closed 200 yuan higher than the previous day, Category C rose 450 yuan, Category D rose 150 yuan, and Category E rose 100 yuan. After the close, speculators moved again, pushing Category C to a new high of 3,300 yuan. Huayan was temporarily banned by the authorities midway through the day. Speculators at the Overseas Chinese Building and other locations also stopped trading. After the patrolmen left, trading continued with great enthusiasm. Each securities firm operated like a juggling field, throwing the prices higher and higher. All closed at their peaks at midday. The reason for this is that neither experts nor laymen can provide a valid explanation. In short, it is driven by speculative capital. With only a few hot stocks and a limited number of shares in circulation, Yongsha and Meiya have risen from thousands to tens of thousands. At the current rate, it is only a matter of time before they break through. This is far from investing and, should there be an unexpected drastic change, it is only the small investors who will suffer. The lowest prices of each hot stock during the day were slightly lower than the opening prices. As a result, Yongsha and Meiya each closed more than 10% higher than the previous day, while Jingfu and the other three smaller hot stocks rose by as much as 20% to 30%. Xinguang was actively pushed up, surpassing Jingfu to lead the smaller stocks. After an initial dip in the afternoon, it stabilized. In the end, Yongsha closed at 5,400 yuan, Meiya at 4,400 yuan, and Jingfu at 415 yuan. The trend of foreign stocks was the same as that of Chinese stocks, with eager buyers. The final result was that both hot and cold stocks closed up by 10% to 30%.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Stable, Lowest Transaction at 1.53 Million Yuan, Closing at Slightly Less than 1.5 Million</h3>
<p>Raw gold still failed to rally yesterday. Although the decline was limited, its momentum was gone. Those holding it were selling more than buying, and their enthusiasm was waning, making it extremely difficult to rally. The opening price in the morning was slightly lower, but stabilized after that. The Bank of China's allocation price remained unchanged. Traders felt the price was too high, so there was no need to register. However, the black market did not become tighter due to the lack of allocation sources, but rather loosened. The price even fell to a low of 1.53 million yuan before rising to around 1.55 million yuan at midday. The trading process was quiet in the afternoon. The final result was that it closed slightly lower than the previous day, down 15,000 yuan. Speculation on US dollars continued. Gold ornaments were 168,000 yuan, a large gold brick was 1,600 yuan, silver dollars were 1,100 yuan, and the interest rate discount was flat. Credit appeared to be loose, with interest rates remaining at 1.6 to 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>US Dollars Improve, Hong Kong Dollar Notes Hover</h3>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were initially weak but then strengthened. Importers wanted to settle foreign exchange, but it was difficult to obtain funds. Buying sentiment was slightly more active and trended towards stability in the afternoon. The opening price in the morning was below 1,950 yuan, initially calm, but rose slightly at midday to a weak 1,960 yuan. Supply weakened in the afternoon, and asking prices rose. Speculation on gold prices rallied to 7-800 yuan per ten taels. The final result was that it closed 25 yuan higher than the previous day. Hong Kong dollar notes were stable, but new notes were uncertain. The final result was that old notes were slightly better, up 5 yuan, while new notes mostly hovered. 1947 notes fell 5 yuan, while 1948 notes rose slightly by 5 yuan. Hong Kong Electric and Robi remained stable.</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Passes Bill Authorizing the Treasury Department to Sell Silver, Priced at 71.11 Cents Per Ounce</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 27th] The US House of Representatives recently passed a bill authorizing the Treasury Department to sell silver at 71.11 cents per ounce for industrial use. Senators from western mining states have expressed strong opposition to this. A certain senator on the Senate Appropriations Committee argued that the Treasury Department should convert its 240 million ounces of freely available silver into cash at $1.29 per ounce. The Treasury Department's authority to sell silver for industrial use during wartime expired last December.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Firm, Soybean Oil Sources Arriving Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market remained flat because although rice merchants were confident, the retailers' demand was average, and arrivals from downriver were frequent, so they were unable to raise prices. Flour demand was weak and lacked vitality, with a slight reduction of 100 yuan. Bran also stopped rising and turned to fall, with the price returning to a small 2-300 yuan. Soybean cakes were oversupplied, and the price was weak and lacked vitality. Soybean digestion remained sluggish, continuing to fall by 3-500 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to trend stably, with arrivals and sales balanced. The oil market saw a surge in arrivals from Qingdao, with sources also arriving from Kaifeng. Scattered arrivals continued from Bengbu, Xuzhou, and other places. In addition, the enemy and puppet management office was selling oil at flat prices to various oil shops, and it was currently being sold. The market was calculated at 90% of the price, so oil prices were feared to be difficult to prosper for a time.</p>
<p>It is also reported that approximately 4,000 piculs of rice arrived in this city yesterday, including 2,873 piculs of white japonica rice, 823 piculs of thin rice, 230 piculs of early rice, and the rest being indica glutinous rice.</p>
<h3>Tea Transactions Rare, Anhui Tea Arriving Continuously</h3>
<p>The tea market situation in this city has been sluggish and unable to rise for several days. The reason for this is that traders from Tianjin and other regions are reluctant to stock up due to sluggish sales. Although shops in this district have been involved, they only have scattered demand. After making profits, sellers frequently increase supply, causing the market to soften frequently, especially Wenzhou Bailin.</p>
<p>Also reported that since the victory, tea that had been imprisoned for a long time was massively exported, leading to competing purchases and a sudden jump in prices. The prices of Anhui tea, which had been stored for years, are almost no different from those in Shanghai. In particular, Tianjin tea merchants are collecting and purchasing tea, which is especially popular, so prices in the production areas have always maintained an upward trend and are unwilling to sell at lower prices. However, since the Tianjin tea market in recent months has been lackluster and export prices need to be raised, only one-third of the stored tea on the Xin'an River has been shipped. Only Wang Yutai here has packed 1,600 boxes for export, while the rest are waiting for the external price to rise. The freight rate for ships carrying 200 boxes each from Tunxi to Hangzhou is 600,000 yuan. The cost of transporting by car to Chun'an is 1,200 yuan per box, and then 800 yuan per box to ship from Chun'an to Hangzhou. Vehicles are very scarce.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Quiet, Raw Cotton Transactions Completely Stalled</h3>
<p>The Japanese yarn market still showed no improvement. Due to unfavorable weather, with heavy rain during the listing season, few people attended the meeting, and the market was extremely quiet. The price of Double Horse brand was still stable, but the price of the rest of the 20-count yarn was sought after by sellers, but there were few buyers, and the prices of all fell by 2-30,000. Fine yarn and thread were even more difficult to move. Sentiment still had not escaped from weakness. Yesterday, Fangjian opened sales of woolen blankets, serge, and other items, a total of 24 types. It is said that cotton yarn will be sold as usual today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton futures fell 11-17 points, with the near-term at US$26.97 and the far-term at US$26.91. The spot price of Middling cotton was US$27.55. Raw cotton transactions in this city were completely stalled, because both cotton yarn and cotton cloth showed little improvement, and the source of foreign cotton did not stop, so the number of Shanghai stocks increased without decrease. Factories and cotton merchants mostly took a dim view of prospects, and there was no negotiation news from Fangjian Company. Therefore, raw cotton transactions were not possible. It is said that factories will only make transactions when the end of the month is approaching.</p>
<h3>Allocated Rayon, Payment and Delivery Today, Silk Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city's rayon market was quiet because silk weaving factories were allocated raw materials, and the payment and delivery were scheduled for today, with a price of 1.4 million yuan per box. As a result, transactions in the market stopped immediately, and the selling prices fell uniformly. 120-count Tianqiao opened at 1.65 million yuan in the morning, the lowest at 580,000 yuan, and finally closed at 1.6 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan from the previous day. Dull and semi-dull followed the decline. Transactions between factories and users were quiet. Sinfu Foreign Firm's 83-point or higher uniformity was 2.6 million yuan per picul, and 78 to 81-point uniformity was 2.5 million yuan per picul. Yesterday, there were more than ten piculs of transactions. The silk market was weak overall. Huocheng checks and crepes opened at 3,750 yuan per yard. The asking price for Meiya bedspreads was 1.15 million yuan per hundred.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Silk Both Arrive in America; Chinese Silk Quality Surprisingly Good</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 27th] Approximately one hundred bales of imported silk have arrived here and are reported to be re-exported to Switzerland. So far this year, about two thousand bales have arrived. It is widely believed that a large amount of silk will continue to arrive, but due to domestic conditions and pricing difficulties, most will be used locally. It is said that the recently arrived Chinese raw silk is of remarkably high quality, exceeding expectations. As for Japanese silk imports, in addition to the 40,000 bales already in stock, 10,000 bales can be imported monthly. According to the director of the Japanese Raw Silk Inspection Institute, about 70% of the silk currently produced is available for export.</p>
<p>Thin Sheet Metal Plummets</p>
<p>Thirty-five-pound thin tinplate was previously in short supply, and prices would skyrocket with even slight purchases. Recently, American goods suddenly flooded the market, causing the market to plummet rapidly, with a catastrophic drop of more than three-fifths compared to mid-month. Each box of 350 sheets is now priced at only 170,000 to 180,000.</p>
<p>Timber Market Continues Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's timber market was sluggish due to rain and slow sales. Moreover, with a considerable amount of fir strips arriving in the market and reports of foreign pine shipments, transactions were scarce, and prices softened further.</p>
<p>Resources Commission Materials to be Transported to Shanghai for Centralized Export</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Resources Commission has shifted its focus of foreign trade to Shanghai. Special minerals managed by the commission will now be transported from various southwestern provinces to Shanghai for export. Yesterday, Guo Zixun, director of the commission's Foreign Trade Office, told reporters that due to transportation difficulties, the quantity of special minerals transported to Shanghai is still not large. Currently, the main task is to continue the wartime material exchange arrangements with allied countries to offset the military supplies provided by the allies to China. Guo also stated that the special minerals managed by the commission include tungsten ore, pure tin, pure antimony, mercury, bismuth, and aluminum, all of which are essential raw materials for military and industrial purposes.</p>
<p>Counterfeit Central Savings Certificates to be Registered Starting Today</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Liquidation Office for the Pseudo-Central Savings Association by the city's financial authorities, the liquidation work has been actively promoted. It is now determined that registration for the return of savings will be processed starting today (28th). All savings from various association certificates will be repaid based on the compensation reserve fund deposited by the pseudo-association. Special prize-winning savings certificates will be calculated and repaid based on the number of non-winning certificates and the average allocation of the deposited compensation reserve fund. All savings will be repaid in legal tender. Payments originally made in pseudo-currency will be converted to legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1, and amounts less than one legal tender yuan will not be counted.</p>
<p>February Relief Supplies: China Receives Over 110,000 Tons</p>

<p>Limited Number of American Automobile Exports</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Detroit, 26th] According to automobile manufacturers, automobile exports will be very limited in the next few years. The current domestic market needs over 15 million cars and trucks, and automobile manufacturers must first meet this demand. Since the victory over Japan, automobile exports have been minimal due to low production volume and a narrow foreign market.</p>

<p>160,000 Children in Beiping Without School, Anxious and Nowhere to Go</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] According to the Central News Agency in Beiping: The exact number of school-age children in Beiping is currently being investigated by the Education Bureau in conjunction with the Police Bureau. Based on theoretical estimates, the total number of school-age children in Beiping may be as high as 320,000, but only 160,000 are currently enrolled, leaving half without access to education.

<p>Publicly Funded Student System to be Canceled This Summer?</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing] It is rumored that the public funding for students in national schools nationwide will be canceled this summer. According to the Chongqing World Daily, this rumor stems from the fact that the budget for student public funding in this year's education budget only covers the first half of the year (until June). The Ministry of Education believes that during this post-war recovery period, most students in national schools come from impoverished families and have relied on state subsidies for years. An abrupt termination would have a significant impact on their studies. Therefore, a special request has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for reconsideration and approval to continue the public funding system.</p>
<p>Youth Army Veterans to Receive Full Funding for Education and Overseas Study</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The regulations for Youth Army veterans to return to school have been finalized by the authorities and are scheduled to be implemented at the end of May.

University graduates will be selected for overseas study for advanced training, with a quota of 300 students per army. All of the above students will receive full funding. As for employment, Youth Army veterans should return to their original agencies. If the service agency has been abolished, the Executive Yuan will prioritize their reassignment. In the future, the Youth Army will become a military education institution responsible for providing pre-officer training to high school graduates. Each training period will last one year, after which they will be reported to the Ministry of Education for unified distribution to various universities, and they will be exempt from entrance examinations.</p>

<p>Education Special Feature: Introduction to the Beiping Railway Management College by Xiao Jin</p>
<p>The "Beiping Railway Management College" is the youngest college within the Jiaotong University system. The "Nanyang" and "Tangshan" colleges both have histories of over forty years, while this college is only thirty-eight years old. However, its efforts in China's transportation construction are not diminished by its youth. Today, her graduates are diligently serving on several railways, highways, and other transportation departments across the country. Although the college is unfamiliar to the public, it is very familiar with society!</p>
<p>School History</p>
<p>As early as the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, railway construction was burgeoning like bamboo shoots after a rain, but the railway rights – including engineering and management – were entirely controlled by foreigners. This aroused dissatisfaction among the scholars and officials of the time, who suggested establishing schools to train talent and reclaim railway rights. In the first year of the Xuantong reign, the signboard of the "Railway Management Training Institute" appeared in a corner of the imperial city.</p>
<p>Following changes in the political situation, the "Railway Management Training Institute" was renamed the "Transportation Training Institute" and a telecommunications class was added. Later, the Ministry of Transportation transformed it into a vocational school, separating postal and telecommunications from railways into two vocational schools. Because postal and telecommunications and railways were brand new courses in China, the school had to rely on foreigners for all its equipment and teachers.</p>
<p>In the tenth year of the Republic of China, "Nanyang," "Tangshan," and "Pingyuan" colleges were merged and renamed Jiaotong University. A Railway Management Department was established in Beiping, and the postal and telecommunications school was spun off independently. The following year, it was renamed the Tangshan Jiaotong University Branch School, and then again as an independent college. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, after the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Railway Department unified the three colleges, and the "Jiaotong University Beiping Railway Management College" officially met the public.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>Like the Tangshan College, after the call to arms for the War of Resistance against Japan sounded, the Pingyuan College only moved out hundreds of hearts unwilling to be slaves. Relying on the assistance of alumni, the faculty and students moved from Shanghai to Hunan, from Hunan to Guizhou, and from Guizhou to Sichuan. For eight years, it shared the same fate and lived the same life as the Tangshan College. They were brothers in adversity; neither could do without the other, and neither could rely on the other. Under the banner of "Jiaotong University Guizhou Branch School," they jointly cultivated transportation construction cadres for the motherland.</p>
<p>"Management" is a newly emerging science in modern times. American Taylor discovered the principles of management from the rotation of machinery, applied it to various industrial and commercial departments, achieved great results, and aroused the research and discussion of scholars, thus achieving today's achievements.</p>
<p>"Railway Management" is a branch of "Management." Similar branches include "Industrial Management" and "Financial Management." As the name suggests, "Railway Management" applies the principles of scientific management to railways, enabling them to exert the highest efficiency, develop excellent business, shoulder the responsibility of a "common carrier," and become the most powerful link in the country's entire transportation system.</p>
<p>Curriculum</p>
<p>The four-year curriculum of the Pingyuan College is aimed at these purposes. The first year is only general basic knowledge training, the same as the courses in a business school, but with the addition of railway-related courses, such as engineering and drawing, and principles of railway transportation. The second year is formal specialized knowledge. In addition to economics and monetary science, there are also courses such as "Railway Organization and Management" and "Passenger Transport Business." The preliminary courses in this year enable students to gain a preliminary and concrete understanding. In the third year, knowledge of railway management, transportation theory, and other subjects are instilled in the students. Eighty percent of the courses read in this year are railway and transportation-related, such as "Railway Freight Rates," "Air Transport," "Water Transport," and "Railway Accounting." All the knowledge and theory that a railway manager or transportation manager should have are laid a solid foundation in the third year. At the same time, knowledge of finance, such as finance, currency, international trade, and international exchange, is also indispensable, so it is also taught entirely in this year. The fourth year focuses on more advanced theories, such as railway operation economics, which is dedicated to discussing the management of railway transportation technology, such as the design of freight stations, the military facilities of terminal stations, the operating system and procedures, the marshalling and development of trains, and the handling and prevention of train accidents. Station management is also within its scope, covering the knowledge that a stationmaster should have regarding station construction, water supply equipment, track classification, employee leadership, and station appearance. Courses such as "Locomotive Construction," "Railway Engineering," and "Railway Material Management" are also indispensable knowledge for cultivating an excellent stationmaster or transportation manager. In short, in addition to railway and transportation knowledge, the four-year curriculum also includes the four-year curriculum of a common business school. The result of such training is not only a railway manager, but also a good accountant. In the past, the Pingyuan College established "Financial Management" and "Railway Management" departments. After the War of Resistance against Japan, due to social needs, it focused on training railway management talent. Eight years of hard work have enabled hundreds of young people to do dredging work for the motherland's arteries, railways and highways!</p>
<p>Present Situation</p>
<p>Turning back to the topic, let us report on the current situation of the Pingyuan College. Despite the material difficulties of the past eight years, the spirit remains as cheerful as it was eight years ago. The spirit of over thirty years of tradition permeates the faces of everyone. Over the past eight years, thousands of young hearts have yearned for her, but only one-tenth of them have been able to embrace her. Over the past eight years, she has not only received the love of young people, but also the praise of society. The fact that the graduates are all pre-booked shows how much society needs her!</p>
<p>Victory brought joy, but also brought distress. The Pingyuan College's return to its original location is also progressing amidst distress. The school buildings in Beiping, although taken back from the enemy, have been occupied again. "Negotiation" is just a powerless method. The "Pingyuan College Student Relocation Promotion Association," organized by all the students of the Pingyuan College, aims to assist her in accelerating her return. Alumni are also eagerly running around and contacting people about the relocation issue. According to letters from alumni, the Pingyuan College may be able to return to Beiping this summer, but there may be problems with the school buildings. The selection of the president of the college has also been decided, with alumnus Yu Shixuan taking on the role. What makes the students especially excited is that the graduates of this year's class may all be assigned to work on the Changchun Railway.</p>
<p>To meet the needs of national construction, the Pingyuan College will further cultivate talents in "Industrial Management" and "Financial Management" and share the mission of transportation construction with her two elder brothers!</p>

<p>Councilors Raise Inquiries, Encourage President Song to Take Responsibility and Let Go; Appeal for Disaster Relief, Do Not Let the Republic of China Become a Disaster Nation</p>
<p>Our Newspaper, 23rd, Airmail News, Special Correspondent Zhao Haosheng from Chongqing</p>
<p>The day of President Song's political report was quite lively. He arrived early himself, and all the ministers and officials under the Executive Yuan attended. Chairman Wang Yunwu was in high spirits. The councilor's seats, reporter's seats, and guest seats were completely filled.</p>
<p>President Song began his report in pure Shanghainese, reading from a manuscript for a full two hours.</p>
<p>The reading of the written inquiries broke the quiet atmosphere.</p>
<p>Kong Ling addressed two points:</p>
<p>The bureaucratic habits of political officials must be eradicated, otherwise, who would be willing to work for them, and even if they were, they would not be able to display their talents.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic habits must be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Ma Yefeng recounted that the Communist army was obstructing transportation in northern Henan, forcing people to relocate in Xixian and other places. At the same time, there were over one million troops stationed in Henan, and the people simply could not afford such military rations.</p>
<p>Zhao Shu questioned whether the Executive Yuan had implemented the resolutions of the previous Senate. He said that the situation in the recovered areas was so chaotic, and President Song, who bore full administrative responsibility, had visited Shanghai several times. What decisions had been made?</p>
<p>Zhao Xuefeng spoke about the many improper actions of He Siyuan, Chairman of Shandong Province, asking if President Song was aware of them. Xi Lun said that there were five large and small banks in Taiwan. He asked if there were any foreign exchange reserves. Why didn't the government quickly establish a central bank at that time? A councilor from the north recounted the Communist army's grain searches and conscription in North China, asking if the government was going to stand idly by and not help these people in North China. Wang Huamin said that Beiping, the cultural city, had become a garbage city. The government initially gave Hebei Province 30 million yuan for recovery expenses, but on average, each agency only received 100,000 yuan. He asked what 100,000 yuan could do. Wang Guanying asked if the government would continue to use legal tender or issue new currency. He suggested that the Changhe Bicycle Shop in Shanghai should be nationalized. Lu Zongqi asked why so many corrupt special envoys had not been dealt with. Zhang Jinjian pointed out that in the current political climate, there was talk of integrity, but everywhere there was corruption; there was talk of efficiency, but everywhere there was perfunctory behavior. He asked how President Song would resolve this.</p>
<p>Inquiries Came One After Another</p>
<p>Written inquiries were sent in one after another, and those who wanted to make oral inquiries were getting impatient. Hu Shuhua, with his big beard, suddenly stood up from his seat and shouted at the chairman, "I protest!" He asked why the chairman had initially announced that there were only eleven inquiries, but the number was increasing. When would oral inquiries begin? Wang Yunwu said righteously that reading the written inquiries first and then the oral inquiries was the law of the Senate. Finally, after counting, there were only six inquiries left. Councilor Hu sat down unhappily, and the reading continued.</p>
<p>Tang Guozhen asked if the Executive Yuan had any solutions for the Hunan disaster. Would they wait until people died before providing relief, or would they save the living? Tao Baichuan asked why the government had to print banknotes in the United States, causing the China Bookstore in Hong Kong to be unable to maintain itself. He also proposed that if Sun Yat-sen currency was issued in the future, it should never repeat the mistake of the 200-to-1 exchange rate.</p>
<p>Zhang Legu's written inquiry was a well-written four-six sentence essay. The last two sentences were: "When superiors and inferiors contend with each other, the country is in danger!"</p>
<p>After the written inquiries ended, the chairman stood up and said, "There are now twenty-eight people requesting oral inquiries. At five minutes each, it will take one hundred and forty minutes, plus a ten-minute break, for a total of one hundred and fifty minutes." In order to control the time, the bell would ring once every four minutes and twice every five minutes. Mr. Wang Yunwu's calculations were clear, and he advocated implementing strict "scientific management" at the conference.</p>
<p>The first to speak in the oral inquiry was Wang Hansheng. Wang, from the Northeast, brought a very heavy and solemn feeling to the entire room with his pure Northeastern accent. He said that recently everyone had been paying attention to the Northeast problem, and the Northeast problem was indeed too complicated. He would not talk about the various obstacles in other environments today, but on the political problem, he raised the issue of changing the administrative divisions of the Northeast. He said that he was not against reducing the size of provinces, but it should be done after everything had stabilized and the entire country was divided together. Because the problem of dividing provinces caused many personnel and organizational problems, delaying the process by two months, the Northeast has become the chaotic situation it is now. At the same time, the government should continue to appoint the three old chairmen from fourteen years ago... At this point, five minutes were up, and the chairman stood up and asked him to stop, which immediately aroused resentment from the audience, and many people shouted "Free speech!" "A special extension should be granted!" At this time, Wang Hansheng turned around and requested an extension of five minutes. The chairman immediately gave a "discount" and allowed an extension of two minutes. Wang still could not finish his words and ended his speech hastily, and the audience responded with an excited and regretful round of applause.</p>
<p>Next to speak was Zhu Huiqing. He first recalled the several guarantees President Song had made to everyone at the previous conference:</p>
<p>Adjust personnel, and if there is to be an adjustment, it must be thorough.</p>
<p>Inflation and high prices could be saved with a large amount of gold. The situation at that time was so generous and great! Everyone applauded and welcomed him. Then, he read the Executive Yuan's report. He faced President Song and said, what is the effect of all this? Hu Shuhua brought up the special salary of the China Textile Company, which was two thousand times higher with an additional four hundred subsidy. He said that if it was a rumor, please President Song "clarify the rumor" here. Xue Mingjian suggested that government orders should be unified. Su Ting asked if there was a solution to the recovery problem, saying that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration had in fact become the "Head Office of Relief and Rehabilitation." Hu Qiuyuan raised three points:</p>
<p>The President of the Executive Yuan should coordinate the overall situation,</p>
<p>Pay attention to restoring production capacity,</p>
<p>Pay attention to the provincial government structure. He said that everyone initially had great "hope" for President Song, but later gradually felt "disappointment," and now it was close to "despair." He hoped that President Song could change people's feelings towards him with facts.</p>
<p>Another councilor asked why Miao Qiujie, who had been proposed for punishment at the last Senate meeting, had been restored to his original position. At the resident committee, Minister Yu had said that this was passed down by the President. He asked what President Song had to say.</p>
<p>Someone else mentioned that Beiping only had people receiving materials, but no one receiving legal matters. In the large city of Beiping, there was only one judge each in the civil and criminal courts. Where could all those cases be "pushed to"? Liu Shutong said that Wang Dongyuan, Chairman of Hubei Province, was a concrete example of a corrupt official, with ten thousand yuan as the minimum and the position of village head as the starting point, resulting in "people thinking of the Han" – thinking of the traitors.</p>
<p>Wu Puguang said that the diplomatic responsibility could not be shirked with the excuse that there could be no diplomacy without internal affairs! Wu Chunzu proposed that soldiers should not be used to govern politics in the future, so as not to waste their talents.</p>
<p>"Push," "Fake," "Chaos"</p>
<p>Someone mentioned that the Executive Yuan's policies were inconsistent, and the gold deposit donation was absurd. Minister Yu said that it was decided by the President, and asked President Song to answer. Regarding personnel adjustments, Huang Yuren had proposed at the previous meeting that it must not be like shuffling seats while playing mahjong, but the reality was just that. Jiang Yiping especially pointed out that the President of the Executive Yuan should be a generalist. Luo Heng said in a voice as heavy as a man's that the Sino-Soviet Treaty was not made public beforehand, and when it was submitted to the Senate for approval, not a single word could be added or changed. Before signing the Sino-French New Treaty, why didn't they consult the people of Yunnan? Why hadn't the border between Outer and Inner Mongolia been determined? Finally, she pointed out that it was possible for Bei Zuji to have endless problems managing foreign exchange pricing alone. Yin Shuxian asked if it was true that Bei Zuji had recently bought a car for his own use with 190 taels of gold.</p>
<p>Xu Deheng shouted loudly for disaster relief in front of his seat, otherwise "Republic of China" would become "Disaster China." He said that there were disaster victims now, and after recovery in the future, there would be disaster officials, disaster civil servants, and disaster burdens. Finally, he said that President Song would certainly not have the feeling of "let them laugh and scold" about all of this, right?</p>
<p>Jin Jian encouraged President Song to "take responsibility" and "let go," and Huang Yuren denounced "push," "fake," and "chaos."</p>
<p>Finally, He Jihong from Hebei spoke amidst applause. He said that the Communist Party in North China was saying that it was "liberating" the people, but in fact it was killing the people, and that it was organizing the youth, but the youth deeply hated them. He hoped that the administrative center would be moved to the north. His words were met with fierce and prolonged applause.</p>
<p>Below was President Song's oral reply. This all-encompassing political problem became the liveliest program of the conference and was extended until the adjournment at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>Hunan Provincial Government Mobilizes New Cadres; Grassroots in Changsha Become Sound</p>
<p>Our Newspaper, 14th, Airmail News, Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli from Changsha</p>
<p>Hunan, which people often thought about during the war, seems to have been forgotten by people after the victory. But in fact, the government authorities should pay attention to Hunan after various problems have been reviewed, in order to repay the price that Hunan paid to the country and the nation during the eight years of war.</p>
<p>From the winter of the 27th year, Hunan became the front line. It protected the southwest half of the country and served as a bridge to the southeast. The abundant food supported the vast military and civilian rations. If not for the defeat in Changsha in the 33rd year, Guangxi and Guizhou would not have been ravaged by the enemy. This proves its importance and also proves that its safety is linked to the safety of the country.</p>
<p>Difficult Situation in Southern Hunan</p>
<p>What is the situation now? The land that had been occupied for almost half of the province has been recovered. The people are free, but the government has suffered various constructions in Hunan during the eight years of war, which were destroyed by the Xianggui War, and has not mentioned restoration at all. As a result, transportation is broken. Only the broken and incomplete roadbeds remain of several railways. The Yuehan Railway is calling for repair every day, but the transportation volume is not as good as the highway. Shipping is even more out of the question. Only a few small tugboats of twenty or thirty tons are dragging their heavy feet on the Xiang River and Dongting Lake. Moreover, the people throughout the province are generally threatened by famine and are generally heading towards the path of death.</p>
<p>Hunan's surrender was in September of last year. The provincial government moved to Changsha with the national army, and has been receiving it for about half a year. The most troublesome thing is that rice prices are rising every day. The rice price at the time of reception was 5,000 yuan per stone, but by the end of the lunar year, it had risen to 20,000 yuan per stone. Around the Lantern Festival, it was even more alarming, jumping to 30,000 yuan. Although there have been several rains since then, and rice prices have fallen several times, they are still hovering around 27,000 to 28,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation in Henan is even worse. Those places are not rice-producing areas, and rice must be transported from Hunan and Changsha to provide relief. Therefore, the price of rice in Hengyang is 60,000, and in Lingling Daoxian and other places it is as high as 80,000, but there is still a market without goods. As a result, the wind of starving to death is prevalent. Almost every day people are starving to death in Lingling Qiyang and other places. As for eating grass roots and tree bark, even the liberated areas cannot avoid it.</p>
<p>Review of the Causes of Famine</p>
<p>Reviewing the causes of the famine, the destruction of the war is of course the first. Half of Hunan was occupied for only a little over a year, but the past few years of seesaw battles have all occurred in the Xiangbei and lakeside areas, which are all rich farmland areas. The losses suffered by the rural areas cannot be restored, and there is not even a chance to breathe. The plows, seeds, and farm tools are all gone. Even the simple farmhouses have all been burned down. Last year, droughts and insect plagues followed one after another, resulting in an autumn harvest of only 40% of previous years. Winter is the season for planting miscellaneous grains, but the heavens were not kind, and it was sunny for two or three months in a row, so that there was neither the possibility of sowing miscellaneous grains nor the harvest.</p>
<p>Secondly, the requisition of military rations is also one of the reasons for</p>
