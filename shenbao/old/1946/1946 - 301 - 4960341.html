<h3>主席夫婦由台抵滬　接見吳市長等垂詢一切　略事休息日內即行返京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣主席偕夫人，於本月廿一日赴台灣巡視，撫慰台胞，並親臨主持台灣光復紀念盛典，已於廿七日下午二時十分，乘專機「美齡」號飛抵滬。專機係於廿七日上午十一時十五分在台北起飛，飛滬時原定在江灣機場降落，後臨時降落龍華，故知者不多。吳市長偕宣局長鐵吾等多人先在江灣機場恭迎，聞訊後立即趕至龍華。主席夫婦適已乘一七七四五號汽車返東平路官邸休息，但在龍華機場迎候者尚有市府交際科長張彼德及警局督察嚴祥鵠等十餘人。</p>
<p>主席夫婦下機時，均笑容可掬，容光煥發，狀至愉快。主席御長袍黑掛，外披黑大氅，戴灰黑呢帽，夫人御黑色外套。專機抵達後不久，既有隨從人員所搭二機先後到達。隨主席夫婦同來者有軍務局長俞濟時，參軍施覺民，秘書沈昌煥·周宏濤·曹聖芬等二十餘人，國府總務局長陳希曾等則於前日到滬。「美齡」號廿七日抵滬後，又折返京，將於廿八日飛滬。</p>
<p>主席抵官邸稍事歇息後，即於二時三十分接見吳市長及宣局長，垂詢上海情形。四時三十分偕夫人等乘一七四四五號車赴虹橋路一帶散步，至六時許返。晚間在官邸進餐，餐後於八時十分再偕夫人等出外，約一小時餘後返邸。昨日吳市長曾三次晋謁主席。聞主席夫妇昨日曾探視盧太夫人。主席在滬略事休息，日內即由滬返京，另有一說，主席可能於今日飛奉化故鄉一行。本市各界近日正熱烈籌備慶祝　主席六秩華誕，欣聞主席蒞滬，咸興奮異常。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北卄七日電〕蔣主席偕夫人廿七日上午十一時十五分，乘美齡號專機有台灣飛滬，陳義·楊亮功·林翼中等百餘人，到機場恭送。</p>
<p>〔又電〕蔣主席偕夫人廿七日晨十時十分離行轅，於十時卅分蒞台省長官公署主持記者招待會，十時五十五分會畢離署，赴松山機場，檢閱儀仗隊後，十一時十分，於樂聲悠揚中登美齡號專機，十一時十五分起飛，在市空環繞一週，即向西北飛去。蔣主席偕夫人自廿一日蒞台，迄廿七日飛滬，在台逗留一週，曾至淡水台中基隆等地巡視，除廿三日宿日月潭外，在台北草山行轅共五日，草山在台北市北郊，距市區十一公里，位三星山與紗帽山之深谷中，拔海四百四十三公尺，泉水含硫磺質，自市內乘汽車四十分鐘可達，廿七日晨主席偕夫人離山，時附近兒童均執旗擁集道旁，依依惜別。</p>
<h3>台灣復員迅速　主席頗爲嘉許</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北卄七日電〕廿七日上午十時，蔣主席自台灣起程之前，在台北長官公署招待記者，到中央社記者葉明勳新生報記者李萬居等十餘人，主席答覆記者對巡視台灣感想如下：</p>
<p>中正此次來到台灣，看到台灣復員工作，已經完成百分之八十，衷心甚感欣慰，尤其交通與水電事業，皆可說已經恢復到戰前日本時代的標準，因此一般經濟事業都能迅速恢復，人民都能安居樂業，以台灣的交通經濟以及人民生活情形，與內地尤其是東北華北比較，其優裕程度，實不可同日而語。</p>
<p>我們今日檢討台灣復員工作的成就之時，對於我們盟邦美國於戰事初停之際，即協助我國辦理遣送五十萬日本僑俘，使台灣的日本俘虜在短時期之內能夠遣送完畢，使社會秩序得能迅速恢復，此種完全出諸純潔之友誼的協助，實在令我們感佩。</p>
<p>台灣的教育已經普及，社會基礎亦頗健全，今後的工作，一方面應該加強人民的民族意識及國家觀念，一方面應該提高人民的文化與生活水準，過去台灣在日本統治時代教育雖稱普及，但日本向來不使台人上進，作各種高深學問的研究，其在台灣所推行的各種政治經濟設施，莫不是以統治殖民地的辦法來治理台灣，今後台省政府施政方針，首應注重民意，培養民氣，爾教育方面，尤須注重互助與自動的精神，使學術思想能自由發展，尤其要發揚民族固有的德行，使今後台胞個個人知道團結與合作的重要，並使之能有自尊自主的品能，成爲建國的幹部人才，希望各位在輿論界的立場，協助政府領導人民，努力建設，則三年五年之後，台灣必可成爲模範的省份。</p>
<p>去年外人對台灣的觀察以爲台灣經過這樣重大的轟炸與毀損的程度我們政府無能，決不能恢復從前日人時代的原狀，甚至公開批評我們政府接收台灣六個月以後交通水電等事業就要中斷，無法維持，但今日事實證明，我們在這一年之中復員期間恢復交通與水利等重要工作並無借助於外人，而各種事業，不但沒有中斷，反而日有進步，足見國人具有建設能力，此一事實誠值得我們重視。</p>
<p>今天臨行匆促，不克多作討論，希望各位寄語台灣全體同胞共同努力，來建設三民主義的新台灣，中正夫婦蒞台數日，備承歡迎，並希代達謝意。</p>

<h3>孫科發表談話　和談六項要點</h3>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿七日電〕立法院長孫科今日接見記者，發表關於目前非正式和平談判之首次正式報告，透露有關國共衝突之六項要點，正式談判尚待此六項要點解決以後方能開始。六項要點如下：(一)東北共軍駐區問題：孫氏謂本年六月間成立之東北停戰協定，指定東北兩省半爲共軍駐區，但當時因安東問題爭執不決，該項協定未曾簽字。但現據中共聲稱，關於指定東北兩省半爲共軍駐區一節並未成立協定，東北停戰協定中所規定者僅爲關於哈爾濱之條款。(二)地方政權問題：應否在非正式談話中解決，抑留待改組之國府委員會解決之問題。(三)憲草提交國民大會問題：孫氏謂，政府鑒於政協會議憲草審查委員會不及制定能爲各方所接受之政協憲草定案，主張將五五憲草視作正式草案。(四)中共在政府改組之前，拒絕參加國民大會。(五)國府委員會及行政院改組應否同時實行問題：孫氏謂，根據政協決議，國府委員會應先行改組，然後再改組行政院。孫氏以國府委員會比作母親，行政院比作兒子，渠稱：「必先有母，而後有子」。(六)國民黨以外各黨派在行政院中應佔之席數問題：孫科於接見記者時透露：民主同盟領袖羅隆基要求共黨及第三方面應得七席至八席。同時上星期五成立之宣傳休戰辦法內容並未照預定日期公布。羅氏謂該項協議尚待延安方面批准。據中央日報稱：該項協定包括下列三條款：(一)國共雙方應即停止刺激性之宣傳戰。(二)關於和談消息，應由第三方面發表。(三)在休戰期間國共雙方發布戰事公報。關於第二項，中共代表團正向延安請示中。</p>
<h3>中共之意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕中共發言人對廿七日南京中央日報所載，孫科對該報記者談話有所駁斥，同時聲稱，此爲中共第一次正面的對政府八條約說明，內略稱，孫氏謂第一二兩條不成問題，共黨則稱，六月休戰談判，國共全部或大部商定之協議草案計四項，現政府僅選其中兩項，又其他三條，孫稱係「雖獲協議，但未簽字」，共產黨認爲六月談判中，政府要求共產黨軍退至兩省半，共產黨根本未予同意，談不到協議，至所謂華中華北國軍暫駐現地，以及地方政權問題，只限於關內，共產黨認爲係政府已明白指出東北除外。最後稱，政府始終堅持共產黨所不能同意之八項要求，籍於談判過程中攻佔安東，繼續全國內戰，充分證實政府毫無誠意，政府代表某氏稱，不知共黨之誠意何在。</p>
<h3>中共承認　撤出安東</h3>
<p>表示對和談有影響</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕共產黨代表團發言人梅益廿七日晚正式宣稱，共軍已於廿四日下午撤出安東，同時表示此與談判有相當影響，政府代表對此事則稱，目前因戰事未停，故常有此類事件發生，如共黨能早日同意政府意見，則決無今日之事。同時安東戰事乃爲國軍在安東一帶採取自衛團擊所致。</p>
<h3>國軍昨收復東台　縣長隨軍入城安撫人民</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江廿七日電〕進迫東台城郊之國軍，自廿五日晨實施攻城戰以來，廿七日我東西兩路國軍同時展開反擊，城內頑強共軍士氣頹喪，旋爲我一舉於廿七日上午九時正式收復東台縣城。共軍紛紛向西北方劉莊潰退，狀極狼狽，刻國軍正乘勝追擊殘餘共軍中。東台縣長已隨軍進駐城內，安撫人民。</p>

<h3>安東以南至莊河間　國軍掌握海岸線　大江橋蘇軍我請其撤離</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿六日電〕國軍於安東以南至莊河間，作全面之推進，所在海岸沿綫如大孤山·青堆子·莊河等地，廿六日盡入國軍掌握。莊河方面國軍，正在清理西南至日人所謂關東州邊綫各地。安東方面通朝鮮之大江橋頭置有蘇軍數名，我已交涉請其撤離，至江對岸至水力發電廠發電等事，亦可無問題，因中蘇雙方均互有需要也。此次安東城內戰事迅速，僅在鳳城附近之摩天嶺及大孤山等地戰事稍烈外，餘如岫嚴等地竟無接觸。據進入岫嚴之部隊稱：渠等進至距岫嚴廿餘里處，因電話尚未被共軍破壞，乃用電話與岫嚴共軍所委縣長通話，詢以怎樣，該縣長以係共軍，乃急促對以該城內僅留二百多軍隊，我不能守了，國軍告以我替你來守好了，國軍旋開入該城。又共軍在安東境內現尚有萬餘人，準備退入山地作遊擊戰，國軍正作肅清工作。據軍事當局宣稱：東北共軍爲解張垣之圍，乃調集兵力發動西安等地攻勢，結果國軍進駐張垣，西安方面共軍亦未得逞，更因此失掉安東，此所謂意欲乘國軍空虛，而反被國軍所乘。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>看這十四天的消息</h3>
<p>中共代表周恩來等曁第三方面代表，於一足期前晋京，恢復停頓已久的和平商談之後，大家都認爲這是目前國內時局的一大轉捩點，我們老百姓無不頓時烯起一綫希望，切望政局從此開朗。蔣主席在飛往台灣之前，曾接見甫自滬抵京的中共代表與第三方面代表，也竭誠表示：「此後商談，由孫院長主持，盼望迅速開始，快快完成。」但是光陰如箭，轉瞬之間，一個星期又錯過了，和談依舊相持在「八點」與「兩條」的爭執上。第三方面雖然盡了極大的努力，參照了政府的「八點」與中共的「兩條」，起草一個折衷方案，但是至今尙未提出，而且內容如何？我們還不得而知。但是從今天起，到國民大會如期開幕，相去祗有兩個星期，和談的進展，好像是蝸牛的移動，怎呌我們一般渴望和平民主的老百姓不焦急萬狀呢？</p>
<p>全國老百姓天天看報，希望能看到好消息；但是所看到的，仍是中共不肯接受蔣主席所提出的八點解決國共問題的具體辦法作爲談判的基礎，並堅持以延安聲明的兩條先決條件爲前提。因此和談就擱淺了，第三方面代表一方面起草折衷辦法，另一方面又要求孫院長電請　蔣主席返京，俾政府隨時能作最後的決定。同時各方面又認爲，如果要這次和談能獲得成功，就非培養出一種友好的政治空氣不可，因此乃商議宣傳休戰的辦法第三方面提出三點：（一）雙方停止宣傳戰；（二）嗣後和談消息由第三方面發表；（三）國共雙方亦得發表戰報。政府在原則上已表示同意，但是中共代表對於第二項辦法，仍要請示延安，一星期來和談的結果，充其量也不過如此而已。翹首瞻望南京，眞令人焦急難耐！</p>
<p>本報站在人民的立塲，曾一再表示，希望國家能够和平統一民主，不但期待國內早日化干戈爲玉帛，而且也希望政治立即能走上憲政的正軌，有一部民主和平的憲法，使任何政黨，不再用武器爲政爭的工具，從此各黨均能以議塲作爲戰塲，以唇舌代槍砲；所以竭誠熱望，一再展期的國民大會，不致再度延期。蔣主席昨晨在台北招待報界，也正式表示，「國民大會決如期召開，政府決不因受任何外力之阻投，而變更此種決心，故國大決無展期可能。」我們聽了，非常欣慰。似是從今天起到國大開幕的一天，相去只有兩星期了，和談還可如此遲綏嗎？十四天的工夫，轉瞬即成過去，還能再蹉跎嗎？所以我們希望第三方面在這十四天內，要特別努力，從中斡旋，使雙方的意見接近；對於中共更盼其能顧全大局，勿橫生枝節，再失此最後的良機；同時也希望政府，能從大處着眼，勿爭小節。務須在這十四天內，完成和談的任務，而使我們老百姓，至國父誕生的那一天，得見各黨派的代表在紫金山下，聚首一堂，共商國家的根本大法，替國家的百年大計，奠定一個鞏固的基礎。</p>
<p>要之，從今天起，到國父誕辰國民大會開幕之日，只剩下十四天了。全國的老百姓，天天翹望南京，時時刻刻，期待着好消息；但願各方面，莫太辜負了人民迫切的期望。</p>
<h3>聯合國的否决權問題</h3>
<p>聯合國第二次大會現正召開於紐約，日來的議題，似集中於所謂否決權的修正問題。英首相艾德禮前在英國會外交問題辯論時，旣表示了英國政府對否決權的態度，認爲聯合國機構的否決權已被某一强國任意濫用，因而發出警吿，認爲：「此等現象將使安全理事會之價値爲之逐漸喪失殆盡。」英國在野的領袖，前首相邱吉爾又從而附和，形成英國朝野對否決權的一致抨擊。降之最近，古巴，澳大利亞，菲列賓等國又向聯合國大會提出要求，請組織特別委員會討論否決權的在廢及修改問題。這一要求的提出，自然立即遭到蘇聯的反對。蘇聯的與論且認爲任何反對否決權的國家，都是和平的仇敵；可見蘇聯的態度如何堅決激昻。在英美，則以爲此一問題旣被提出。自應提付大會討論。此一立塲，與蘇聯的態度不相容，因此，關於否決權問題的討論及處理，將爲太次聯合國大會的一個難題；此一問題將來究竟如何發展，關係世界持久和平的維繫，良非淺鮮，實在値得我們的注意。</p>
<p>所謂否決權原係美國憲法上所規定的一種制度，其目的在使政府的立法，行政及司法三部門彼此間能够有相互的約束及節制。美國憲法的制立，適在法蘭西革命之後；其時的政治思想受盧騷夢德斯鳩的影響甚深；而夢德斯鳩固稱頌三權鼎立政制的人。本此三權鼎立及制衡的學說，美國憲法於是規定了美國的政制。這就是國會通過的法律，可以不簽署否決之；但當此一法律重爲國會通過時，則行政的否決便失去其效用，惟有等待司法的否決，纔能使此一法律無效。此一制度的發生，蒙了很濃的十八世紀的意味。美國若干公法學家亦有認此制爲不合時宜而主張修改者。然在美國，還有否決否決權的規定，所以對於本國的施政還不致有多大的流弊。</p>
<p>聯合國機構之有否決權的規定，可以說究全是遷就蘇聯的一種辦法。蘇聯因爲感覺到在一個世界機構裏，它的與國少。難以操縱聯合國的票決。所以當在組織聯合國機構計擬的時候，它就表示蘇聯以否決權之建立爲參加聯合國的必要條件。在當時的情勢下，倘使沒有否決權的規定，聯合國機構就將遭到難以產生的厄運。英美的政治家不是不明白如果有此項規定，這聯合國機構本身就有先大不足的徴象，將使將來聯合國機構的運用遭遇到莫大的危難。可是此地，像在別處一樣，故　斯福總統認爲至誠可以感人，他認爲憑他的才智，必能贏得蘇聯的支持，所以他不因「小節」而讓了步。然而現實政治與羅斯福總統崇高的理想，未必盡能符合；而羅斯福總統却未及見世界和平與以後聯合國機構的運用而與世長　了。</p>
<p>不用說是項否決權的規定使這個聯合國機構形同虛設，是一種極不合理的制度。中小國家的無法享受此種特權，固已失國家平等之旨；同時，否決權在安全理事會無限制的使用，造成少數壓迫多數的局面，只要有一國反對，便可以使安全理事會不能有什麽決議，取什麽行動，其爲不合理，可以想知。過去一年來否決權的使用，究不免是聯合國機構的一個致命的障礙，使它的工作無法得以推進。所以從聯合國機構本身的效能上講，此項否決權的規定無異是一種癱瘓，若不施行手術，難期恢復健康。爲健全聯合國機構本身的組織，自然最好這種否決權的規定能够予以廢棄。可是在目前的情勢下，否決權的　棄似乎還是一個不能達到的目的。我們爲聯合國大　組織的效能着想，似乎不能容許否決權的無限制的使用，必使其運用能受到某些限制，則或可減少一般人　於否決權的譴責。</p>
<p>但否決權保留也好，受到限制也好；這些都是外表的形態。國與國交，倘使能够互有誠信，則否決權的有們，便決不會成爲問題；其所以成爲問題的原故，便因爲國際　誠信的缺乏。茲常聯合國大會討論否決權之際，我們要籲請各國必須先建立起彼此間的互信，然後一切問題，便能迎刃而解，否決權也就不致再成爲一個問題。</p>

<h3>江南徵兵並無變更　暫緩實施僅限京滬兩地</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州二十七日電〕二十六日滬地某報刋載兵役局長徐思平談話，謂京滬一帶徴兵，因準備不够。決定暫緩之新聞，引起本縣及錫武虞吳　等各縣人士密切注意，一時頗見轟動。本報駐蘇特派記者爲求證實計，特於二十六日訪駐蘇團管區司令杜緒，因公出未晤，二十七日晨又再度趨謁，承予接見，吿稱：徐局長所談緩徴地帶，僅以京派兩地爲限，爲滬報誤加一帶兩字，致生疑　，殊深遺憾，甚盼予以糾正。現木區所轄蘇虞吳三縣徴兵工作，以　邑成績最佳，該縣額定八百名，迄至前日已徴集半數。蘇州額定九百八十名，雖已絡續送縣騐收，而城區未見發動，故已集數量僅二百名左右。吳江額定四百五十名，則始終未獲徴集報吿，本人已決定於廿八日親赴該縣督導。總之征集期限爲本月底，各縣務必如限徴集，記者繼詢以新兵徴集後之訓練工作，如何展開，柱氏答稱：暫時三縣就地施行初步之入五教育，且體育之，即蘇州組成六中隊，常熟組成二中隊，吳江組成二中隊，由本區司令部分派幹員，至各縣主持訓練。俟入伍敎育完成，則或將擇地集中實施正式之步兵訓練。杜氏末幷謂：兵役爲國民天職，故決不能濫竽充數，務必全屬正式縣民之及齡壯丁，希望各縣長切責注意云。</p>

<p>勸家長們謹防拐匪</p>
<p>我有一點社會性的報導，可能在貴刋發表嗎？讀十六日貴報第九版刋載，「七日香港航訊」內稱：「……澳門設有誘拐孩童之機關，……一面派人出入港澳和廣州各地，設法誘拐「適合條件」的孩子。據筆者探悉：一個七八歲的小孩，聰明而面目端正的，男女不拘，每個近値國幣百萬元以上」。</p>
<p>這種事件，顯成爲目前社會的一個最嚴重的間題了。現在揚州，近日已迭次發生孩童失踪的事實，據我所知，在過去兩星期內，已有四個均在十歲上下的男孩失踪了。其中有敝戚周正福一名，男孩十一歲，湖北人，在江都縣立小學讀六年級，即於十月一日赴校時失踪。曾經四出多方尋覓，迄今仍是杳如黃鶴。該童言語聰明，而面目端正，亦屬最「適合條件」者。前項拐匪，是否業已潛來內地，由共誘拐而去，則不得而知。但總可斷定揚州已有同類的拐匪，在實行着工作。我奉吿有兒童的家長們，要特別的注意一點，並希望各地的社會治安當局，也不要忽視了我這一個報導。（張蘊玉）</p>
<p>輪渡再漲價無理由</p>
<p>市輪渡自本年四月一日起，對江渡由三十元漲爲一百元，（戰前四分）長渡綫自上海至西渡，由八十元漲爲二百元。（戰前八分）。市輪渡目前每月收入在二億元左右，每月支出約在一億五千萬元左右，盈餘五千萬元，用作修理配置等用途。現聞市輪渡因開支不敷，將於十一月份起，再漲價。上海市輸渡·電車·自來水·電燈各公用事業收費比例，目前以市輪渡收費最高，已超出戰前收費二千五百倍以上，若再漲價，實無理由。公用事業原不以營利爲目的，市輪渡在現况之下，常以市民福利，社會秩序着想，不應首先漲價，引起人心的不安。（潘伯升）</p>
<p>榖價和物價不相稱</p>
<p>我是一個鄉下飽受敵人蹂躪的老百姓。誰都知道，中國是以農立國的。八年中我們鄕下人受着敵人的淫威，和奸商的壟斷，使我們鄕下人每年到稻熟的時候，將米價貶値得比猪吃的糠還不如，這原是敵人要促使我們中國走上不亡自亡的途徑，讓我們佃農破產。試看近幾年來各處鄕間鬧着米荒，十家倒有八家寅吃卯糧，向人借米來過的，這豈不是一件笑話？要知道他們望到收成時，米價又貶値了！還去米債和各種欠賬，再加上買一些過年貨，倒說已去掉收數十之六七，等到再留出一部份明年種田下本，一年生活，又困在東拖西凑的苦况中。這樣年復一年，豈不是王小二過年，愈過愈糟，豈料勝利倒有一年多，對生活的改善，仍不見絲毫功效，而各種物價的突飛猛漲，而米價的貶値，又不知賤到何等光景！鄕下收成的時期快到了，循例照着敵僞時代的作風，憑着奸商取巧，各物上漲，軍米的限價，使承辦軍米商乘機囤積！總之，一切的一切，在這個稻熟出米時期，會使你們鄕下人把所有汗血，換不到二三分的代價！莫怪人心惶惶，不能安定了！危危乎中國立國本源，希望當局勿再漠然視之。（吳衛江）</p>
<p>壽縣小商販的哀鳴</p>
<p>我是壽縣迎河集的一個小商人，開了一個雜貨商店，販賣捲菸糖及土酒，生意好的時候，可以得到溫飽。現在生意也不行了，因爲壽縣水災太重，又加上苛捐雜稅太大，自從前月，貨物稅局，來了一個高主任，眞是利害，整天領着稅兵，如狼如虎的，沿門尋査，鬧的鷄犬不安。碰見外埠買來的捲菸，小盒上貼着查騐證，還說不合法，非有印花不可。如無印花，不是補稅，就是罰款。事實上他的所謂印花，究竟是什麽式樣的，也沒有見過。十斤八斤的白糖，也要報稅，並且還要看分運單。窮小的商人，販賣幾斤糖，那裏來的分運單呢？迎河集大興菸廠出的鐘山捲於，沒見他貼過印花査騐證，一樣的銷售市面，也沒人說他是犯法。附近十幾個鄕鎭酒戶，倒有二百戶，每月每戶，要納一萬七千元，甚至兩萬三千元不等，祇說有票，從來沒拿出來，難道現在什麽簡化稽征辦法，是這樣的嗎？眞令人不解。（仁信）</p>

<p>今將本人意見提出幾點，請辦托兒所人士，作爲一種參考：（一）房屋必需比較寬大，並環境淸靜，空氣新鮮爲主。（二）取費不得超過六萬元，（這一點是平民的經濟最高限，而托兒所當然是爲平民而設立的），（三）所址應設立郊外而在中心區，假學校或敎會設一辦事處，每星期六中午，家長可至領兒童回家。並於星期一早晨交所方，由辦事處用車輪載回托兒所。（四）所方應拒絕任何酬勞，使護士無特別優待一孩，而致發生階級弊病。（五）不應收保證金，可取舖保辦法，以减輕家長之負擔。（六）絕對需注重兒童之飲食營養及體格記錄。以上數點，亦只大略而言，望有志社會事業者注意及之。（兪文虎）</p>
<p>繳罰款拒收關金券</p>
<p>鄙人於前（十九日）驅車向江寗路脚踏車登記檢査納稅處交付本年下半之稅，因過規定之時日，故須依章照罰二千元¥交於換軟照會之窗口罰款交納處，關金廿元計五張，該收款者怒目相加說：此處只收法幣，不收關金，請敎關金與法幣不是同等正貨麽？適因鄙人只帶關金票，只能退出該處，向另烟攤上換了再納，此種麻煩，敬請該主管當局明白査覆，以免納稅者多受麻煩！（寅生敬上）</p>

<h3>制止濫用否決權　英擬定秘密方案　顧維鈞定今日發表演說</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿六日合衆電〕據英外部人員稱：英國已擬定秘密計劃，以制止蘇聯在安理曰會之「造次」使用否決權。英國之方案，將在適當時機，於聯合國大會行使，至方案內容，目前不能發表，否則將有碍於使用之最後成功。又英外交政策專家承認此項計劃立獲成功之望極爲微弱，英外部不認爲蘇聯撤銷反對聯合國討論否決權事件建議，爲蘇聯變更態度之表示。一般人士認爲蘇聯之參加此世界組織完全基於莫斯科所稱之各强國一致同意之基本原則者。英國戰略之第一步，或爲向蘇聯作有力之表示，謂聯合國絕大多數之國家，均反對蘇聯以否決權爲政治武器之政策。然若干觀察者認爲蘇聯並無因此即改變政策之理由。蘇聯勢力範圍外之　論，對於克姆林宮方面並無如何作用。莫斯科電台本日討論古巴及澳洲在紐約提議取銷否決權事，闡明蘇聯對此問題之態度稱，彼等之所以被選出從事此種工作者，係圖掩蔽反動英美集團破　各强國一致性之企圖，蓋各强國之一致同意通過原則，對彼等之自我支配世界企圖不能適應也。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿六日專電〕預定廿八日上午對聯合國大會演說之十人當中，我首席代表顧維鈞亦居其一，預料顧氏將論及中國關於否決權問題之立塲。顧氏將爲五强代表中之第二位發言者，第一位乃英國之貝克，過去三日來發言者多係小國代表，所討論者以否決權問題及西班牙問題爲主。由十四國組成之統籌或指導委會，廿八日上午及晚間將開秘密會議，繼續檢討臨時議程。迄今爲止，委員會已通過議程中五十三項中之四十五項。安理會經長期休會後亦將在新主席賈德幹主持下重行開會，討論瑞士所提任非會員國之地位，參加國際法庭之要求。按照憲章規定，非會員國經安理會推莽大會通過後，亦可參加法庭。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿六日電〕聯合國大會將結束第一週之辯論，五强否決權仍爲第一號爆炸性問題，而重重壓力或將追令對於否決權之使用，作一明確規定，其跡象業已漸增。連日經十三國代表致詞，及數次緊張之委員會議後，顯見於此時修改憲章廢除否決權，已甚少此可能性。蘇聯曾在安理會中九次使用否決權，現時進行之目標，似欲迫其同意對於否決權之使用方法酌加修正。椰威，智利，土耳其三國，今日已加入限止使用否決權運動。早先發表演說之各代表，對於「過度」及「任意」使用否決權，亦均表示扼腕。據挪威代表藍傑稱，修正聯合國憲章，其時機尙未成熟，但請各強國對於使用否決權自行成立協定，僅以此作爲最後應用之一種保障。土耳其代表貝杜則稱，人類常取決於多數之意志，以否決權列入例外，殊無理由，但在過渡期間，或不能即行廢除否決權，至少亦應考慮一種方法，以限制其使用之範圍。智利代表合里沃亦謂，聯合國機構最重要之任務，爲確定人類之權利及其基本自由，智利於目前不贊成修改憲章，但希望强國盡力限制否決權之使用。</p>
<h3>印度爭安理會理事席　英决予全力支持　聯大會塲前印國旗飄揚</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約弗魯辛廿六日電〕聯合國會塲前五十國國旗內，亦有印度旗在內，然據印度某代表稱，該旗並非印度國旗，乃印度總督之旗，就印度代表團言，此事並無任何重要性，印度目前尙無國旗，現擬設計一足以代表國民政府之旗，並擬使其包含國大黨及回盟之黨旗。</p>
<p>又關妝印度聲請爲安理會理事一點，英國代表團決定予以支持，英國當反對蘇聯之建議以挪威爲理事。英方人士可常述及之候補理事，爲比利時，哥倫比亞及叙利亞等三國，英國或當撤銷對比利時之支持。蓋向西方民主國之利益而論，歐洲已有英法兩國參加安理會也，聞美國將支持哥倫比亞，以繼任期屆滿之墨西哥。</p>
<h3>貝文外相　啟程赴美</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿六日電〕貝文外相定於明日淸晨，率同私人秘書狄克遜，外務部助理次官哈維爵士，自此間乘坐飛機前往南安普敦港，搭乘郵船「亞基坦尼亞」號前往紐約，出席聯合國大會。該輪當將在法國奢埠停靠，接遝聯合國大會其他各國代表同往紐約。</p>
<h3>英對西政策</h3>
<p>不受工聯決議影響</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕勃萊頓之工　大會雖議決要求英政府立即與西班牙絕交，然料貝文外相當不致受該一決議之影響。英政府已一再聲明，對西絕交，適足增强弗朗哥政權在西班牙之地位而已。英政府與工聯組織對弗朗哥政權所取之態度均相同，所不同者方法耳。下院及工黨最近曾聞貝文闡明對西班牙之態度，均已表示擁護此一政策。</p>
<h3>太平洋島嶼　美不放棄管治</h3>
<p>〔中央社弗魯辛草地廿六日合衆電〕據悉美國不久將採初步步驟，以將加羅林及馬紹爾羣島交付擬議中聯合國託管理事會管制。官方人士稱，此種實際託管，在相當時期內，或不致即予擬訂，苦戰得來之太平洋島嶼，在過渡期內，仍將由美國管治。美國宣佈將島嶼土地交付託管之旨意，並非美國放棄管治。</p>
<h3>美駐南大使　將返國述職</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿六日專電〕美國務院今日稱：美駐南斯拉夫大使柏德遜，將自貝爾格勒飛返華盛頓。柏氏之返國，僅係私人行動，並無任何重要性，然僉信拍氏返國，與過去兩週巾駐蘇大使史密斯及駐波大使勒恩之返國並非偶然者。駐蘇大使及駐親蘇之南波兩國大使之返國，可表示美蘇關係之緊張，及高級官員間，對忍耐而堅定之對蘇政策之商討。</p>
<p>〔聯合社貝爾格勒廿六日電〕蒂托總統最近迭次發表演說，指責巴黎和會失敗，並謂，吾人之權利並未被吾戰時之盟國所正確承認。大西洋憲章，僅存一紙空言。</p>

<h3>美爲維護世界和平　須確保海軍實力　杜魯門發表海軍節文吿</h3>

<p>尼米資强調海軍重要性</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社美國印第安諾波里斯廿六日電〕本日爲美國海軍節，尼米茲海軍上將在此間發表演說稱，在國際警察尙未成立以前，美國海軍仍應準備隨時出動。人類一日需要經由海道遝輸物資，自此一大陸至彼一大陸，則美國海軍仍爲不可缺乏者。海軍當局未便將原子炸彈之危險性估計過低，吾人應知海軍戰略，將依照何種方向發展，俾能避免新的危險。潛水艇必須在海水極深處活動，始能濟事，美國海軍現有實力相當於戰時六分之一云。</p>
<p>美國須取獲兩洋控制權</p>
<p>〔路聯社波斯頓廿六日電〕美海軍軍令部副部長薛爾曼中將今日在此發表演說稱，美國必須取得北太平洋及北大西洋之海空控制權，若無我人在歐，歐洲即不能保持均勢及安定。兩洋海空控制權之獲得，爲保護西半球之先決條件。他人雖可經由北極自空中轟炸美國，但如美國力足報復，即無大碍云。</p>
<p>原子潛水艇作戰新利器</p>
<p>〔路透社坎薩斯城廿七日電〕美海軍水底作戰部主任史達爾少將於海軍節發表演說稱，在他日之海軍中，配有原子火箭砲或原子飛彈而以原子能發動之長程潛水艇，將佔有極重要之地位。潛艇以原子能發動，可在水底保持極高速率，並可作未有限制之長程航行。在自衛方面，空中原子彈或雷達之測探，對該種潛艇效果較少，在進攻方面，其原子火箭砲配備等，乃威力最大之進攻武器云。</p>

<h3>傳英埃談判　已商獲協議</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕埃總理薛特基率領之十三人代表團，於今晨搭機返國。薛氏臨行未曾發表談話。開羅報紙謂此次談判中已成立協定，關於蘇丹問題，英國已接受埃及之觀念，使該地併入埃王治下。</p>
<h3>蘇聯當局苦心經營　研究德技術秘密　德工廠技工被移運至蘇境　漢堡咨議會促英採取行動</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社德國哈爾鎭廿六日電〕二次大戰末期，德國發明一種噴發式飛機，每小時速率達七百五十哩，其計劃已擬就，但未及製造，德國即已崩潰。蘇軍兵進柏林，故覓取此項計劃之原本，但被美第三軍巴登將軍所部捷足先得，蘇聯爲之失望。蓋每小時飛行七百五十哩，等於聲音之速度，故爲飛機之最大速率，蘇聯決心硏究此項飛機之秘密。距今數月以前，蘇聯忙於召集戰前曾在哈爾鎭西倍爾飛機廠作工之專門人員，使其恢復工作，而將研究所得結果，報吿蘇聯當局。聞此項計劃於本年秋初幾近完成。此輩技師每月工資六百馬克，但時時有分紅，有時多至一萬馬克，並有糧食與捲烟等特別分配。當時此輩技師曾簽訂合同，規定於必要時派往蘇聯工作，此項合同至今將被遺忘之，乃聯合國對德管委會最近決定組織調査委會，調查德德國境內所有軍火廠是否正在拆卸，蘇聯當局發覺此種工作務須加緊進行，但在德國地方選舉舉行前，並不採取何項行動。直至本月廿五日乃開始拆卸此一工廠，而依照合同將廠中二百五十名工人與機匠遣往蘇聯本國。此輩工人新簽合同，保證在蘇聯留居五年，每月工資高達五千馬克，多數工人對於待遇優厚，頗爲滿意，但一部份工人亦感覺不安，因彼等在火車站時，由哨兵加以守衛，吿以任何人企圖脫逃者，當予槍擊。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿六日電〕英軍區咨議會在漢堡通過決議，抗議將德國工人及其家屬移往他國之行爲，並要求英國在盟國管制會中採取行動。此間所獲報吿，謂蘇聯搬運德國工廠之第一階段工作，係集中於火箭·噴氣及V型武器工廠及科學實驗室，此等廠多位於麥克倫堡·薩克宋尼·杜林齊亞·及哈爾資山等處。在蘇當局下工作之德籍官員估計，自德國被移往蘇聯之德國工人，技師以及彼等之家屬，甚至女朋友等已達五萬人·蔡司鏡片廠某工人，乘自由車逃抵英軍區，渠謂蘇聯兵士其中有已喝醉者，以槍柄毆擊不願意赴蘇之工人，婦孺睹狀均號叫不已。拍林之蘇聯系報紙則謂德國工人之被運赴蘇，均得本人同意，日前自也那來此之　司廠代表數人，已代表工人上電史達林，請勿拆除該廠設備，電係托蘇佔領軍總司令蘇柯洛夫斯基元帥　達。</p>
<h3>蘇若繼續指責美政策　美將不貸款與蘇　貝爾納斯向報界正式表示</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華華盛頓廿六日電〕蘇聯領袖若不停止批評美國之外交經濟政策，則向美國申請十萬萬元借款，勢必無望。同樣，捷克與彼蘭兩國向美國支配下之「世界銀行」共同由請八萬萬五千萬美元借款，亦將不易通過。美國務卿貝爾納斯於新近招待記者時，業已明白表示，今後美國之經濟援助將僅給與友好各國，不指斥金元借款爲經濟奴役之工具者。據官方非正式談稱，貝爾納斯之言，主要係針對蘇聯指責美國援助東歐各國之方案爲金元外交，經濟奴役，及經濟的帝國主義而發。三個月前，美國曾爲借款問題向蘇聯發出第三次照會，現正靜待其答覆。蘇聯不願於事先同意，合借款與考察東歐經濟狀况爲一談，致美蘇兩國之實際談判至今僵持。</p>
<h3>羅外交政策　對各國保持友誼</h3>

<h3>戈林藏毒別法　先將藥管吞下肚再自糞便中檢出</h3>
<p>〔路透社海爾福城廿六日電〕調査戈林自殺案之四國委員團，今晚在紐倫堡發表報吿，認爲監獄美當局以及德籍服務人員均無任何罪責。報吿書有謂：本委員團於詳細調査後，所得結論如下：（一）戈林於初次被捕時，即藏有該管毒藥，直保藏至一九四六年十月十五日夜爲止，（二）證據顯示戈林曾將毒藥藏於肚臍肌內，（三）證據復顯示：戈林在被監禁期間，始終將毒藥藏在該處，有時曾將藥管吞人腹中，然後再自糞便中檢出收藏。監獄長美國安特魯斯上校及其屬員曾採取每一必要措施，防止戈林自殺，所能辦到者均已辦到，故無罪責可言。又據紐倫堡法院英軍醫解釋稱：肥胖如戈林者，其臍孔甚深，可以容納小管毒藥，若吞入腹中後，則於廿四小時內可以完全不被發現，除非以愛克斯光透視，始能發見其腹內之金屬管。至於將金屬管吞入腹中，對其消化機能亦並不一定有礙云。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐倫堡廿六日電〕英國華爾許將軍，法國莫萊爾將軍，今日在紐倫堡法院招待記者謂：戈林遺書三通已送交盟管會，或不致予以公布。自戈林所致監獄長安特魯斯上校之信觀，看守人員似與自殺案無關。</p>

<h3>美國南方棉花煙草地　葛林微爾城之夜（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>南北戰爭以後八十多年的今天，美國的南方和北方，仍然是兩個世界。北方的工業，經過道八十多年來，已經成爲世界經濟的覇主，南方雖然也有了工業，但社會經濟，一般仍然以農業爲主，北方人民的進取和開明，與南方人民的淳厚而保守，恰恰是一個對比。就拿黑奴來說吧！林肯總統打了四年「內戰」，爲的是要解放黑奴，內戰打勝了，黑奴解放了沒有呢？這就依然是一個問題。我從芝加哥坐火車到田納西，一路過了辛辛娜蒂，便</p>
<p>實行「火車分坐」</p>
<p>從田納西的諾克斯微爾城到南加羅里那州的長途汽車，白人依次從前邊坐到後邊，黑人便依次從後邊坐到前邊，坐到兩邊「會師」，司機便高叫「滿座」，這樣，以後的乘客便祇好等下一班了。公共汽車非常擁擠，從半夜開到白天，班次很多，都是長型的，比上海重慶的公共汽車要長百分之五十。車子的坐位非常舒適，椅背仰靠，可以自由轉動，行李放在輪胎和坐艙的隔層之中，旣不佔位置，又沒有放置車頂餐風宿露的顧慮。南北加羅里那州，田納西，喬治亞，道一路的人，都歡喜坐公共汽車。原因有兩個：第一，</p>
<p>南方人都節儉</p>
<p>公共汽車比火車價錢便宜；第二，這一路多山，火車行車、因爲爬山比較緩慢，因此火車的客運，多半便給公共汽車搶去。汽車走的是翻山的險道從田納西州到北加羅那之間的著名「大霧山」，（也譯作斯摩干山），盡是九十度轉灣的羊腸小道，和中國的川湘公路彷彿相像，我眞担心他的長型汽車，屁股轉不過身來。五個鐘點翻過大霧山，車子停在北加羅那州的阿希微爾城；我沒有在道兒下車一直奔到南加羅里那州的葛林微爾。一路上，盡是恬靜可愛的農村，田　之間，點綴着小橋流水，麥田裏站着稻草人，和中國的農家相仿。</p>
<p>葛林微爾城內</p>
<p>有七萬六千人，四萬人集居在城內，三萬多人散居在四郊。城雖然小，但也有熙熙攘攘的景色，居民的敎育程度極高，小城中有男子文理學院，和女子文理學院各一座。南方人習性比較保守，宗敎氣味勝過一切；男女社交，也不像北方的那樣放縱。我在葛林微爾城中的自由大厦樓上，找到了商務廳。一位女秘書替我找讓華僑的人數及居住地。她化了很多時間，找到了一個湯姆李。她說：湯姆李是本市唯一的一個中國人，他是一個洗衣作的老闆。其實，湯姆李回國十多年了，現在的洗衣作老闆叫倣勞芳。他是廣東開平人，三年以前，他來葛林微爾城，接辦了這座洗衣作，他的前任也不是湯姆李，因爲營業方便，老閣儘可一任一任的辦交代，洗衣店的牌號依然如舊。勞芳說：從湯姆李創辦起，到他之間，大的有五六次更換了。他說：他確是居留在這座小城內的</p>
<p>唯一的中國人</p>
<p>然而，雖然沒有中國人；了解中國的人，在這座小城內，却有不少，大部份都是傳敎士。我到葛林微爾去，原是去訪問十五年前敎我英文的一位洋老師：勞蘭，竇維思先生夫婦，但却撲了一個空，竇氏夫婦戰時居留在檀香山，十多年一直沒回美國。南方的小城市居民，對陌生面孔的異國人都比較親熱。當我在找人失望之餘，我遇見了一位體格結實的中年人柏格威，他是竇維思幼年的摯友，竇去中國傳敎，他仍舊留在美國。他說：竇維思每次回來，必定大講其中國，「他的中國故事是講不完的，一講便是半年」。柏格威對中國有一個非常良好的影象，他是當地文理學院的畢業生，他太太雪蘭斯，是一個學者，也是一個賢慧的主婦。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會各種委員會召集人，定今日下午三時，舉行第一次聯席會議，討論市府交議收回上海自來水公司或准其展緩十年問題。緣英商上海自來水公司曾於公元一九〇五年與前公共租界工部局簽訂專營合約，關於一九二八年三月十七日重加修訂，其有效期間爲二十年，(自一九二七年一月一日起至一九四七年七月一日止，約內載明工部局如欲收回，須於期滿二年前(即一九四五年一月一日前)正式通知，否則延期十年。去年本市復員後，奉行政院傳奉主席電示，電車公司自來水公司即係合約期限在一二年中即將屆滿，應俟期滿研討收回。當由市府公用局於三十四年(一九四五年)十月二十六日通知該自來水公司，合約期滿后，不再繼續收回公營在案。並與該公司非正式交換意見，該公司對於價購一點，並不反對，但以通知之發出已在合約規定「期滿二年前」之後，則申明保留，市府對於該公司合約屆滿後之處置方針，曾提市政會議討論，以該公司法定資本已增爲二十英鎊票面股票四〇，二三六股，一英鎊票面股票三五九，二八〇股，合共一，一六四，〇〇〇英鎊，又規銀二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩，及國幣三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，其實收資本則共爲一，一六三，二二五，英鎊，又規銀二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩，並於一九〇五年，合約內規定以二十英鎊票面股票九七五股贈送工部局，嗣該局又購得二十英鎊票面甲種股票三，二〇八股，一英鎊票面乙種股票一五，六六〇股，及一英鎊票面丙種股票五〇，〇〇〇股，合計一二九，八二〇英鎊。目前租界收回，本市既有編前工部局之股權，故該公司實已含有官商合辦之性質，按諸國防最高委員會第一四八次會議通過，在不妨碍主權及計劃實施之前提下，以各種方式吸收外資之原則，似可不必急於收回，益以本市甫經復員，復興建設，需款方殷，若於咄嗟之間籌措鉅款，作爲收回該公司之資金，際此市庫支絀實感難於籌集。爰擬准其展延期限十年，並與洽談修訂合約，務以維護主權發展公用事業爲主旨。日前特函請市參會討論後見復。參會准函後，以眾關重大，適值休會期間，爲求透澈明瞭各參議員主張，並得迅予決定方針函復市府起見，即分函徵求各參議員意見，擬奪總提交今日下午三時舉行各種小組委員會召集人第一次聯席會議討論決定，以資補救。</p>

<h3>上海市面積　應予擴大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市與江蘇省劃界事，迄未完全決定。某重要人士曾非正式表示：上海市之面積，必需予以擴大。因現代都市之標準，每平方里之人口，以五千至一萬人爲最合理；但今日上海地狹人稠，最高之密度有一方里二十萬人者，此於市民之健康，大有妨碍。</p>
<h3>美海軍捐助防癆協會　活動房屋兩座　搭建完成光綫空氣充足</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市防癆協會，近由美海軍方面捐助活動房屋兩座，已於虹橋路該會第一療養院搭建完成，昨日上午特招待新聞界前往參觀。該項活動房屋，係半圓形，四角用石塊支墊，故離地約一英尺，不致有潮濕之慮。兩壁均係玻窗，光綫空氣極佳。現其中之一已安置免費病牀十七張，另一則暫作客廳膳堂之用。</p>
<p>美國紅會捐贈病床　防癆協會成立於一九三七年，主席顏惠慶氏，現有療養院兩所，虹橋路第一院原有病牀七十二張，現增十七張後共爲八十九張，其中頭等七張，二等四張，三等二十四張，餘者均爲免費。愚園路第二院則共有病牀約三十餘張。最近美國紅十字會捐助全市所有防癆機構病牀二百五十張，該院亦可分到一部份。取費方面，住院費頭等每日二萬八千元，二等一萬五千元，三等三千元　，藥費在外，以此項頭二三等之收入貼補免費病牀。</p>
<p>經費時感困難　昨日並由該會總幹事黃嘉歷及醫師梁爲楨報告防癆之重要及療養院近况。經費方面，除小部份由行總津貼外，大部份均靠外界捐募，時感困難。醫藥用具方面如氣管檢查器，醫藥用具方面氣管檢查器，X光片，藥品開刀器具等，均感缺乏，希望各界樂予捐助。又該會將於本年耶誕前推銷防癆郵票，一方面藉以籌募經費，同時亦爲提倡防癆。</p>

<h3>抢修淞滬铁路　将築至南吳淞</h3>

<h3>市政府所屬人員　千餘人曾任偽職　其中警察佔絕大多數　若令去職將影響治安</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃以「戰期中曾任偽職，而未依漢奸條例判罪之公務員懲治辦法」何日實施，叩詢吳市長。據吳市長談稱：自行政院之該項調令到達市府後，即令市府所屬各機關審查。現據人事處之統計，市府中曾任偽職者，計達一千六百二十餘名。該項公務員之應受處分，自無疑義。然問題在於數目如此龐大之公務員，去職後將如何繼續彼等現任之工作。據記者向人事處探悉，一千六百二十餘人中，警察佔絕對大多數。本市現有警士，已感不夠，則在後補警士未有把握時，若令其去職，則必於治安發生嚴重影響。故與市長認爲該項調令，在原則上自須實行，但聞限於事實，執行時對於條例之規定，乃實施時日等，或將有所變通。</p>
<h3>收支不敷尚微　市府不致裁員</h3>

<h3>上海扒窃党的黑幕　(八)</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>黑店良心黑　殺人不見血</p>
<p>扒竊黨每日所竊得的賊贓，爲數自屬可觀。此種贓物在竊得的數日後，例須售與黑店，而且必須售於各該地區的黑店，不得越界出售，更不得私自售脫與私人，或是正當營業的舊貨店，以免走漏風聲，貽書全幫弟兄。事實上那些正當的舊貨店，對於這種來路不明的較貴重東西，也多半不敢接受，以避免破案後的損失。</p>
<p>這種專收賊贓的黑店，創立於上海已歷多年，在租界時代，那時是半掩門式的營業。開這類店鋪的人，也是老弟兄幫中有資格的爺叔輩，此輩對扒竊原是過來人，而且年紀到把，平日又善於儲積，居然可以開設店號，自立門戶，在幫中弟兄看來，自然也屬於「年高德劭」的一流人物，但此類店廠，也有合法營業和非法營業之別，茲分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）「客窑」——即小型客棧，專供貧民及幫中小鬼借宿。之用</p>
<p>（二）「悶窑」——專收拾荒雜物者。</p>
<p>（三）「小路窑」——專收賊贓的舊貨店。</p>
<p>（四）「擺天平」——以收舊貨爲名，收賊贓爲寶。一二兩種無甚足述，本節專記三四兩種違法黑店的內幕。</p>
<p>爺叔輩經營此種非法營業，自然風險甚大，所以必須大放交情。在「租界」時代，他們儘量結納公門中人，和聯絡該地段有面子的「白相人」，同時又須拿出「面子」，壓倒那些「不二不三的蔗末」之流。因爲上海街頭，儘有不少起碼無賴，專靠恐嚇敲詐找錢，祇有「面子」可以壓倒他們。「小路窑」因係違法營業，所以店址必須絕對秘密，但爲買賣便利計，又須開設在其勢力範圍內的船埠碼頭附近，而又不能不讓幫黨中的弟兄曉得。因爲扒竊黨所有賊贓，全係臨時偷來，當然大小貴賤，全無一定形式，而且竊得者也都不知市價現值多少，於是黑店的主人便可以辣手殺價，出極少的代價，取得貴重的貨物。大約所出的代價僅值市價五成乃至十成而已，利益之優厚，真屬駭人聽聞。</p>
<p>每一家黑店劃佔着一個碼頭，同行間雖表面講交情，但界限很嚴，無形中各不相犯。因爲彼此同屬壓榨階級，對外行賊黨來賣小貨的，向例拒而不受。彼此奉行此規律。如果幫中人想多開一家黑店，來嘗嘗「小貨窑」的「甜頭」，那無異搶奪了老店的利潤，勢將發生一番摩擦或衝突。</p>
<p>「擺天平」是公開的黑店，表面上和一般舊貨店無異，事實上却在專收小貨，但對「跑底子」幫的碼頭贓物絕對不收，祇收「吃壞飯」幫之贓物，所以維持其與「小路窑」黑店的界限，彼此決不衝突。這種黑店的利便處，乃是收買後立可公開出售，用不着像「小路窑」那樣鬼鬼祟祟地做買賣。</p>
<p>開「黑店」的自非「黑心漢」莫辨，他們以「賊刦賊」的姿態，向冒險偷竊的弟兄們盤剝打刦，坐享最大的利潤，實屬可惡至極·「小鬼」輩奔波所得，結果却養肥了這班殺人不見血的黑店主。</p>
<p>失風在臨陣　猶是嘆才難</p>
<p>扒竊黨雖說進益優厚，但須機警伶俐，智勇雙全，在濟濟多士的幫黨弟兄之中，能夠經「爺叔」輩訓練完成，應世後勝任愉快的，不過十之一二。尤以扒手一門，需有高級的拔術方算「出道」，若是手法拙劣，一登場便有失風之處者，根本是不堪問世的庸才，所以「爺叔」輩也時常發出「才難」之歎。而且技術無論如何高超，祇要幾經沙場，難免要因失風而入獄。工夫學就，都已成爲牢獄中的「臭盤」了。「臭盤」再在街頭出現，最易引起警探或電車售票員之注意，於是行動失却自由，狡計便無由施展。這是「臭盤」最引爲頭痛的事，因此幫中爺叔輩喜歡找尋一兩個「洋盤」入夥，無異增加一支生力軍·所謂「洋盤」者，乃是一種半路出家的落魄青年，年紀已達二三十歲，在童年時未曾如幫中弟兄受過「小鬼」的「初級教育」，終日躊躇街頭，看慣扒竊黨的扒錢神通，不免見獲心喜。於是偶然試做一兩次，方才吃到甜頭，却被該地段的「爺叔」瞥見，開頭便加毆打，說也希奇，「不打不成相識」，祇須「洋盤」情願拜師入幫，爺叔自然接納，幫中有一「洋盤」，上街時不致爲巡警所注意，行動自由得多了。且因缺少經驗，無所顧忌，胆子特別大，所謂「初出道貓兒狠似虎」，再經爺叔教以幫規切口，訓以日常功課，自不難成爲一名「良才」，可是出道後仍舊不免成爲「臭盤」，這是最可憾的一件事。</p>
<p>扒手幫對於入獄並很担心，他們最害怕的是失風之後，給路人當場捕獲了。或在電車中無處脫逃時，羣眾便拳足交加，大家不負責任地亂打一頓。打後或者各自四散，或是交給巡警，且不論當場所受體刑的痛苦，往往給羣眾打成內傷，時常門牙脫落，當場吐血，脅骨打斷等症，都容易造成致命傷。「打死扒手張阿狗一名」，在本埠新聞裏登載不算一回事，人家還要罵他一聲「咎由自取」呢。</p>
<h3>公用事業加價　電力准先調整　電車尚未考慮</h3>
<p>本市公用事業，近來監傳將於下月起同時漲價，非僅加重市民負担，且足刺激一般物價，關係民生至匪壽鮮。華東社記者昨特以此問題，詳詢市公用局長趙曾廷氏，趙氏解答要點如下：（一）本市電力以成本過高，開支至鉅，逐月虧耗甚重，迭據該公司陳述業務苦衷，要求酌予調整電力價格，曾經本局派員詳查，所陳尚屬實情，已決定核准，該公司先行調整價格。（二）電車變更票價，已由英法商電車公司提出請求，唯增加之倍數標準，尚未考慮。（三）公共汽車以燃料成本過高，準備使其維持最低成本。(四)自來水電話等價格，須經縝密研討決定。</p>

<h3>上海物價今昔觀</h3>
<p>本報特稿</p>
<p>自戰事開始以後，物價如脫韁之鳥，日日高漲，漫無正境。本年九月份生活指數爲四九六·七三九·七〇，以民國廿五年爲基數一〇〇，則十年來上漲已近五千倍。現往一元法幣，僅值戰前二厘弱。在此高物價下過生活，人人感受壓迫，大都在死亡綫上掙扎。</p>
<p>怎樣會造成空前的物價汪漲呢？在第一次歐戰時，全世界都有物價高深的親象，但中國物價，自戰爭開始到大戰終上，祗增加了二成，美國却增加了一倍多。可是這一次大戰期間，中國的情形，便和上次不同，遭遇了空前的大場面，物資需要甚急，造成了這直綫上升的高物價。上</p>
<p>海自淪爲孤島後，人口不但沒有减少，反而日漸增加。淪陷區日益擴大，人民不勝苛擾，均以孤島爲安樂窩，按踵而來。人口一多，消費自大，戰後交通又未暢通，貨物不得源源而來，在供求不相應的原則下，自然成了「物以稀爲貴」的局面。至於通貨膨脹，外國緊縮，都是形成物價問題的因素，但這留待專家們去分析罷。</p>
<p>有貨皆可囤無物不居奇　黑暗時期一段回憶</p>
<p>物價狂漲，好比「空穴來風」，我們但見商店裏的標價，三日一換，五日一易。只聽到衖堂裏的米販子，信口開河的把米價二百，三百，三千五千的亂加，但這還不是促成物價萵漲的主因。上海本是個投機市場，戰後許多高等難民，携來相當資金。自歐戰爆發後，港澳富商，更挾鉅資來滬。上海市場上的資金，格外充斥，一無正當出路，羣趨於投機之一途。除了外匯，烚赤，棉紗等物而外，視綫更轉移到貨物上面去，且較烚赤外匯更需穩妥。最初僅爲米，麵粉，雜糧，豆油等等。其後金融界對於這最穩妥的貨物放款，盡量放鬆，使經營囤貨者，脾氣益壯，力量更厚，極盡壟斷操縱之能事，火柴，肥皂，香烟等品，均爲囤積之目標。真是有貨皆可囤，無物不居奇了。</p>
<p>囤積之風盛行以後，整個的上海社會便成了一個大賭場。所有資金，莫不用以囤貨牟利，構成了一個大機構。在這偉大的囤貨機構中，共有三等人物：隱身於政治舞台的幕後，憑藉其勾結政治神通的用龐大的資力，來收買貨物，這是有特殊勢力的囤戶。銀錢業吸收現金，利用別人的本鈿，去發自己的橫財，亦是囤貨的康莊大道。這是金融界的囤戶，開工廠所以供應生產，開商店所以分配消費，可是工廠沒有出品，商店不做賣買，而以工廠商店爲幌子，從事囤貨，這是工商業的囤戶。其他「踢皮球」的小囤戶，已無足齒數了。</p>
<p>限價與黑市</p>
<p>囤積之風一開，大家都抱着製造不如販賣，販賣不如囤積的觀念，市上貨物，盡爲囤戶所壟斷。貨物既少，價格自然扶搖直上，大有百尺竿頭之勢。奸商們的荷包果然滿了，誰還想到有多少人，因高物價而在死亡綫上掙扎呢！這一道「鴻溝」劃分了孤島的天堂和地獄。</p>
<p>物價高漲時，前租界當局也曾三令五申地去取締，成立物價平準委員會，公佈主要物品價格。採用公定物價政策，目的在於遏止物價的上漲，而結果則公佈價格與實際價格脫了節，商品反因限價而給人藏匿起來。貨物絕跡於市上，需要者乃不得不求之於黑市。儘管當局嚴格管制，但一面肯賣，一面願買，交易便成立了。買方若不出這價格，就買不到他所要買的東西。由限價而產生黑　，因黑市而抬高物價，相互循環，永無止境。</p>
<p>限價和黑市，從此展開了劇烈的爭鬥，前租界當局雖將違章的商店處罰，甚至查封，但並不見效，所苦的祗是一般小商人。至於操縱市場的大囤戶，有可恃的靠山，有可用的財力，更有神秘不測的手段，雖在嚴厲控制之下，終不能過止物價之上升。</p>
<p>戶口米</p>
<p>物價漲風所以不能遏止的原因，乃在行政當局不能把握物資。管制物價必先統制物資，故前工部局成立一物資統制處，調查倉庫中所存貨物。一面設法開源，購進貨物，直接分配給消費者，此法比限價似乎積極一點。</p>
<p>某米店要賈平價米，某　園要配給豆油，這些好消息傳到市民耳中是够欣慰的，雖然每人祇有幾升米，幾兩油，總比沒有好些。於是扶老携幼，拿着麻袋筐籮，齊集店前，排成「一字長蛇陣」。雖然店門要到早晨六七點鐘纔開，可是隔夜八九點鐘光景，已有人在那裏守候，像到廟裏去趕燒「頭香」似的。好容易等到開門，大眾又起了一陳紛擾。本來在做賣買的時侯，可以一個一個的分配，但總是我擠你，你擠我，鞍子給踏脫了，東西給擠掉了，甚至孩子受傷，孕婦小產。這一幕戲，是够緊張，也够悲慘的。</p>
<p>買配給的東西，既如此之離等了大半夜，在人羣中擠着至少幾小時，而所得到的米只够　餐粥量，大半還是紅米與糙米，加上一些砂石。市民對於配給是失望了。結果不但毫無效果，反而助長了黑市的猖獗，使人更陷於不安之境。</p>
<p>同時，這極少量的配給品，還不能按時按量的配發，因爲先要應付敵軍大量的給養，再要供應奸偽們種種的苛求，所以來源仍不暢通。租界存在時，四郊爲敵偽控制，太平洋戰爭發生後，物資缺乏，更爲嚴重。最初所配給的是米·鹽·油·等重要日用品，漸漸連肥皂·火柴·香烟等也列入配給單中了，但這僅表示物資的獲得更困難，並不因配給項目的增多，而民眾得蒙其福。</p>
<p>戰前的物價</p>
<p>現在這樣龐大數字的生活費用，是在近八年中蛻變而成的。我們不要說百年前，數十年前了，就是把戰前的物價和目下一比較，已相去天壤。前工部局衛生處曾以前公共租界內之食品售價，按日調查，以資比較。玆將幾種重要食品的價格，列表於後：</p>
<p>物品　單位　價格</p>
<p>牛排　磅　·四七</p>
<p>精牛肉　磅　·九八</p>
<p>黃魚　磅　·六〇</p>
<p>猪肉　磅　·四九</p>
<p>火腿（生）　磅　·九六</p>
<p>醃肉　磅　·六五</p>
<p>活鷄　磅　·五六</p>
<p>捲心菜　磅　·〇七</p>
<p>洋山芋　磅　·〇四</p>
<p>橘子　每個　·一七</p>
<p>檸檬　每個　·二一</p>
<p>從上表看來，相隔雖祗十年，但物價高飛，却不可以道里計。</p>
<p>物價的漲風沒有隨大戰結束</p>
<p>戰時因交通困難，物資缺乏，上海的情形又特殊，物價瘋狂似的上漲，還可以解釋。大家希望勝利能早日降臨，物價的壓迫，自可解除。勝利的爆竹，終於轟動了全上海，但物價的漲風，却沒有隨戰事而結束，仍繼續其一貫的作風，漲！漲！漲！</p>
<p>在勝利初臨時的上海，物價確見下跌。但重慶人至了上海，看到上海東西，比重慶昆明便宜得多，紛紛購買，商人見有利可圖，又立即更改他們的標價，略作休息的物價，因此繼續地上升。三十四年九月的工人生活指數是二九·九二三·六二，十月升至四四·一四二·四三，增加了百分之五十，十一月升至一〇二，一九〇，八三，比十月又增加了一倍多。本年九月份的生活指數。爲四九六·七三九·七〇，和一年前比較，所增過十七倍。試問如何去控制這瘋狂的物價。</p>
<p>米是民生最要緊的東西，去年九月間，每石約六千元，接着漲至八千，九千。廢歷年關一過，已突破萬元。人人又爲糧食而担心了。糧政局在今年三月間放出了二萬萬元的購米貸款，鼓勵米商赴產區採辦，以充裕上海的糧食，米價自然可以下降了。豈知在貨款未發放之前，糧政當局認爲是一筆好賣買，放出以後，糧商却不到產區中去辦米，而將貸款在上海市場上採購，以致米價越抬越高。糧貸助長了米價的上漲，終終被人揭破，此即鬨動一時的糧貸無弊案。</p>
<p>糧食一漲，其他各物均有所藉口，把價格提高了。加以工潮層出不窮的發生，統制配給等名詞，又在上海出現了。</p>
<h3>職員與工人指數是怎樣編成的？</h3>
<p>現在上海所見的主活費指數，除西僑一種外，共有兩種：一種爲工人生活費指數，一種爲職員生活費指數。工人生活費指數，編製最早，民國十八年，由前社會局創辦，用的是「家計調查法」，在東西南北及浦東五區，選擇工人家庭五百家，替他們逐日記賬。其選擇標準爲（一）三口至六口之家，（二）月入二十元至六十元。當時記滿十二個月的只有三百零五家，共得賬簿三千六百六十本。指數中所包括的物品，即根據這些賬簿計算而來的，共分六十品，計食品三十一品·衣着十一品，房租三品，燃料八品，雜項七品。據編製者的說明，物品取「樣」，因名目繁多，品質不一，頗費斟酌，同時又注意到各種物品的比重，例如米與糖比，米重於糖是也。在於調查物價：（一）區域有五：東區，南區，西區，北區，浦東區，依區域大小與工人多少，每區選代表商舖若干家。（二）時間則物價變動不大者，每月十五日調查一次，變動較多者每週調查一次，以計算一個目的平均價。（三）品質求其一致，有標準牌號者，用標準牌號，否則參任比較。所用計算公式爲「加權總合式」之一種。基期採用民國十五年，其理由以是年經濟情形平隱，並無特殊變動，並便與國外指數比較云。</p>
<p>職員指數</p>
<p>職員生活費指數於民國三十年，由前工部局工業社會處創辦。其初亦徵求職員家庭五百家，記錄收支細賬，自十月十二日至十二月三十一日，規定爲三個月。當時應徵家庭共一千〇三十八家，其中一百六十七家，隨記隨停，四百三十家所記賬目，不適於用，其餘四百四十一家則依規定辦法記訖。因急於應用，曾根據一百家之賬冊，先編臨時指數。記賬家庭，（一）限於本市中國職員階級，家主不限行業，惟幾民，工人或自設企業者不合選。（二）自立門戶家庭，不依賴祖遺產業收入，或家長津貼爲日常生活之費者。（三）家主薪津及其他收入，每月以法幣五百元至一千五百元爲限，其薪給爲外幣者不合選。（四）家庭人口，夫妻各一，連同子女及依賴者，以不出十人爲度，寄寓納費者，以及僕役，均不在內。（五）家庭住所，限於貨屋而居者，其自置住宅或寄寓服務處所，而不需納付房租者，不合選。（六）家庭伙食，限於自辦，或雇役烹飪，其包與廚司或　作者不合選。若因服務或求學關係，在外膳食者，不在此限。據當時調查所得，一百家中求學者二百二十四人，占家屬人數百分之三三·九四，有職業者，男一百零八人，女十三人，共一百二十一人，占百分之一八·三三，妻有職業者僅六人，子四人，女三人，子女收入，不充家用，故有職業者一人，須負擔五人以上之生活費用，僕役在內。此一百家之職業如下表：</p>
<p>製造工榮　男一一人</p>
<p>運輸交通　男一六人　女一人</p>
<p>自由職業　男二人</p>
<p>躉售業　男一一人</p>
<p>教育　男一三人　女七人</p>
<p>公用事業　男一五人</p>
<p>行政機關男　二三人</p>
<p>金融銀行　男一〇人　女二人</p>
<p>零售業　男　三人</p>
<p>教會　男　四人</p>
<p>合計　男一〇八人　女一三人</p>
<p>據當時核計，收入平均每家每月爲六八八·三八元，支出爲八八三·七八元，收支相抵，已不敷二七四·〇八元云。至其編製方法，大率與工人生活費用相同。</p>
<h3>不堪比較　一筆舊賬　明末清初回憶錄</h3>
<p>上海物價高漲，並不是最近的特殊情形，可說由來已久。不過近年來漲風之劇，實堪驚人，若與過去數十年的物價相比較，真難令人置信。</p>
<p>明末清初的米價，崇禎末年，上海連年旱荒，米價漲到每石紋銀石兩，（清制一兩折錢七百文）已是空前的高價了，餓莩纍纍，奔走告急。至順治六年，秋收大熟，糧米每石祇值一兩二錢，粳米賤到九錢。康熙即位，天下承平，五穀豐登，米價每石降低至二錢，釀成穀賤傷　的熟荒。許多富有之家，儘管盈會粟米，竟抵不過所完納的田賦。爲了進稅，紛紛棄之而逃，此非笑話，確是事實。</p>
<p>清初麥價，也以康熙年間爲最賤。新麥初熟，官吏就開始嚴追完糧，農民因急需糶麥換銀，繳納國庫，所以忍痛賤賣，一石僅三四錢。康熙九年，小麥每石銀七錢，賀麥每石銀六錢，已是待善價而沽之的了。</p>
<p>棉布</p>
<p>棉花和布疋：上海自宋代末年開始，便已稱植綿花，與稻田等量齊觀。崇禎初年，棉價每担銀四五兩。後因流寇四起，無法外運，漸趨下游。至順治三年，跌到每担五六錢，最貴時爲順治八年，每担九兩。但通常總值三兩左右已算是很貴了。至於布疋市價，則大致爲銀兩三錢。</p>
<p>豆腐與肉的價錢：黃豆從前是比米賤，豆一石抵米七斗。崇禎十四年，上海大旱，豆多米少，米一石可換豆二石。順治九年，則米多豆少每石價九錢，而豆價反值一兩八錢。康熙初，上好大豆每石值銀五錢，貴的也不過在五六錢之間。賤價的豆，製成豆腐，自然一文錢够燒兩三大碗。</p>
<p>猪肉與鹽糖</p>
<p>上海猪肉市價，常在銀二分上下。清兵南下，在戎馬倉皇中每斤漲至一兩二錢。迄順治之世，始終沒有恢復明末的原價。直到康熙十二年，才又低至每斤二分五厘，此後便常在三分左右。在三月不知肉味的上海市民聽了，真有恨不得早生百年之概。</p>
<p>鹽和糖：上海濱江瀕海，乃產鹽之區。崇禎年間，鹽價賤至每担一錢五六分。順治年間，每斤紋銀一分，順洽八年四月，因遇大水，曾高至銀六七分，爲清初上海鹽價的最高紀錄。</p>
<p>至於上海糖價，在明末上白庶糖每斤值銀三四分。順治時海疆多故，糖的來源受阻，每斤值銀四錢，直至康熙中年，始恢復舊時糖價。康熙二十年，白糖每斤值銀三分，赤糖則賤至一分。康熙二十五年，每斤更降至錢二十文。</p>
<p>初開埠時　上海西僑生活</p>
<p>明末清初的市價，距離現在的生活太遠了，我們再看一看上海開埠時的情形那時銀元已流入中國通行的是西班牙銀元，俗稱本洋，每元約合制錢一千四五百文。華北捷報（字林西報的前身）一八五〇年九月十四日曾載西人伙食店中各貨售價可知當時物價的低廉，實非今日上海市民所能想像：</p>
<p>新鮮牛肉　每元十四磅</p>
<p>新鮮羊肉　每元十二磅</p>
<p>新鮮猪肉　每斤一百二十文</p>
<p>猪油　每斤一百三十文</p>
<p>雞　每斤九十五文</p>
<p>鴨　每斤一百十文</p>
<p>雞蛋　每只六文</p>
<p>麵粉　每斤二十四文</p>
<p>冰糖　每斤一百二十文</p>
<p>砂糖　每斤五十六文</p>
<p>番薯　每斤十八文</p>
<p>上表所列價目，已比普通華人所購者爲貴，但現在看來，真是便宜得無以復加了。</p>
<p>不過那時生活費用雖低，生活也仍不容易。當時有西僑藍氏，著「上海社會談」一書，謂在上海支用四百鎊，還不如在英國支用一百鎊來得舒服。當時苦力工資，每月四元，而已受訓練之「僕歐」，則須六元。這時的銀元，已是墨西哥銀元了。據藍氏之言，更不知當時英倫三島的生活，低到如何程度。</p>
<h3>七十年前一席酒</h3>
<p>「富家一席酒，窮人半年糧」。素被人認爲豪華的酒席，歷年價格變遷，究竟是怎樣的呢？同光年間，宴客最講究的筵席，是兩紅兩白的整燒烤席，每席價十二千文。次一等的，是十六高裝，八大八小的燕菜席，價五千六百文。若不用高裝，改爲十二碟四拼盆，祗須五千文就够了。魚翅席的價值爲四千二百文，有十二碟六大六小四點心。海參席也有十二碟四大四小四點心，價祗二千四百文。至於款待隨從下人的飯食，每桌有六大碗，不過一千二百文而已。</p>
<p>同治十一年，上海葉知縣，爲其母祝七旬大慶，所辦筵席，計燒烤二席，魚翅十三席，次菜魚翅十二席。紹酒一百七十斤，上麵二百分六碗，中麵二百十四碗，下麵千碗，共費洋二百六十六元，錢八十七千八百九十八文。算起來現在還不够吃一頓客飯或早點。</p>
<p>至於平日膳食，當時衙門裏的伙食費，規定知縣每天四百文，其餘分爲上中下三等，上中兩等，每人每天八十文，下等每夭六十文，臨時雇工如拔草掃垃圾等每天只有五十文。可是那時誰都能舒適地過活，聞之不勝艷羨。</p>

<h3>故紙堆中　幾頁伙食賬</h3>
<p>在舊書中，找到幾頁伙食賬，距離今日已四五十年了。看到當時的物價，亦不勝今昔之感。一，光緒廿七年的一頁米每石一千二百文，麵每斤十四文，柴每百斤七十文，肉每斤五十六文，鷄蛋每個四文，兩個七文，糖每斤廿四文，酒每斤十八文，布鞋每雙八十文。雇人力車普通自十二三文至四五十文，五馬路至梵王渡，一百數十文。西門至徐家匯，僅六十文。大茶肆如華總會萬華樓等，兩人合一碗，祗廿八文。麵每碗十六文，饅頭每件七文，三四人品茗，化二百文已足，若化三四百文，那已是飲酒點菜了。</p>
<p>二，宣統元年的一頁米每石兩元，柴每百斤一百文，猪肉每斤六十文，油每斤五十六文，醬油每斤六十四文，蛋每枚五文，鷄每斤六十文，青菜每担一百五十文，轎子每次四百文（約十里），理髮每次五十文，市房每幢月租三元。</p>
<p>看了這兩頁舊賬，撫今追昔，不禁有天上人間之感。那時四五口之家，月入二十元，儘可安適地過活了。光緒中葉，銀元每枚兌換制錢，尚不足千文，至宣統間，亦僅一千一百文，二十元可兌制錢二十千左右，就日用費用最重要的食住兩項計算，衹須四五千文已足，其餘消費，尚有十五六千，生活自可滿足。若稍稍節儉，每月還可多下一點來作爲儲畜。</p>
<h3>生計難謠　平民歲入能幾何　老弱殘疾將安仰</h3>
<p>民國十八年，楠華山入盛承宣先生感於物價昂貴，生計艱難，撰生計難謠一首。但今日之物價，又不可以道里計矣。其詞曰：</p>
<p>「生計難，生計難，說來叫人真浩嘆。白米百斤十一元，糙米每元九斤半，粗柴每斤錢二十，毛柴也要十二三。一角大洋鹽一斤，九分大洋油六兩，紹酒每斤洋一角，豆腐二塊三銅板。一千錢買一斤肉，七百錢買一斤　，潮魚每斤洋兩角，邊白　　價任喚，六十錢買一鴨蛋，七十錢買一鵝蛋，去年鷄價突奇貴。五十起碼買麥粉，三十起碼買糖醬，油條燒餅臭乳　，却要三十錢一樣。青菜黃瓜菉豆芽，百錢差堪炒一碗，冬來菘芥本便宜，百斤也值二元餘。三十錢買一肩水，百廿錢買一斤炭，茶葉價看粗細定，五角一斤葉連管。粗布三百錢一尺，洋布五千錢一丈，六元一條棉布被，五元一頂棉布帳，草蓆一條錢二千，氈毯一條錢一萬。火柴一匣二十錢，煤油一箱四元強。無論冠履衣裳那一件，總要一元起碼才能辦。此皆日用所需品，時值物價不稍讓，比之他處說便宜，比之清季十倍將。一元大洋值三千，其實祇有三百銅枚換，尋常門戶五口家，日用一元無餚饌，平民歲入能幾何？老弱殘疾將安仰，即此已見度日苦，况加稅捐人情應酬之負担，生計難，生計難！」</p>
<h3>社會服務　提倡社會保赤事業　銀行界紛紛捐鉅欵</h3>
<p>幼兒康保健院分向各界勸募中</p>
<p>上海市幼兒康保健院，爲我國新創教養衛療之保健機關，成立後因限於經費及院舍關係，以致事業無法開展，自潘公展先生擔任董事長以來，對於此種保健事業，極感興趣，並賦予極大之熱誠，即由潘氏向銀行　　經費，計中央銀行認捐五千萬元，中國中農中央信託局郵政儲金匯業局各一千萬元，第七區機器職業公會認捐五千萬元，並由地方賢達劉鴻生·徐寄　·駱清華·奚玉書·錢劍秋·水祥雲分組擔任勸募，並由潘董事長敦請社會局吳局長担任總隊長，統籌一切事宜。</p>
<p>又日昨本市鶴鳴鞋帽商店楊撫生君送來捐款一百萬元，業已轉送該院，至於其他捐款，因尚未結算，容後發表，仍盼各界踴躍輸將，共襄義舉。楊君原函云：「公展議長先生台鑒：幼兒康保健院之設，在謀兒童之健康，奠定建國之基礎，功在生民，情殷保赤，前日拜聆，敬佩良深，敢不勉力追隨，以期早觀厥成，謹奉上支票一百萬元，至祈察收，自慚滄海一粟，惟望　腋成裘，臨穎鈥遲，諸惟察照，專肅敬頌，勛　。楊撫生手上（附支票國幣一百萬元）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕近十數日來，天氣和暖，布銷不暢。且銀根緊急，折息高昂。布市價格，已小去十之二三。而紗價脚地仍堅，所跌甚微。其原因由於棉紗產量本屬不足，　營紗廠實力較厚，更無須貶價出售。紡建則配價雖低，而配紗甚少，且棉紗複製品工業，平日存紗極薄，工作旣不能停，原料非隨時添補不可。故紗價始終在堅挺中，　以細支爲最。自吳市長兼任紡織事業管理委員會主任委員後改進聯合配紗制度。人心略定。日來六區棉紡織公會及棉紗複製品各公會正在積極部署，今日即可開配。</p>
<p>配價看低</p>
<p>配價以二十支爲標準，爲一百七十五萬元，較前上漲二十萬元。聞六區棉紡織公會所擬定者，木不祇此數，嗣經吳市長核定如上，則較市府會議席上複製品業某負責人所提議之一百八十萬。尚覺低　，吳市長曾表示紗價必須壓低，而主張出之以漸。則下期配價，或可能核減，據紗廠業中人云，目下棉紗成本，小型廠在一百四十萬光景，大廠較低。如報載宋院長准續撥外匯購買洋花之訊屬實，則紗價原可再減。</p>
<p>配數標準</p>
<p>本期核定配紗總額爲一二，〇〇四件半，內計染織業七，八一六件半。針織一，九〇二件，內衣一，〇一五件，毛巾被毯七二〇件半，手工棉織四六〇件半，手帕九〇件。此係吳市長根據各該複製品工業公會申報之需紗，總額按六折計算，光撥二分之一如上數，以充此半個月內之配售量者。前星期市府召開會議，吳市長徴詢複製品各業之意見。某負責人曾當塲表示。此數本屬不够，但近日天暖銷滯，銀根又緊，六折當可敷用，並稱有幾家也許領不完云。據棉紗複製品各工業公會配紗委員會透露消息，各業所需，各種支數之紗都有。其申報册，曾分類列明。而上開之配數，則係據以合成二十支標準者。實際上當有多種支數云。</p>
<p>分配手續</p>
<p>紡管委員會此次配與各複製品工業公會之紗，聞係於昨日下午開一總單，交與承配各業之聯合委員會，而再據以分撥與六個公會，由各公會按各會員前所申報之數，照同一比例攤配者。複製品承配委員會，已在計劃此項工作。據其負責人談稱，如紡管會所來之支數不台，分配時將感困難。急待需用各廠，當祗能就所來支別，平均作比例之分攤云。各會員廠之實際需紗而未及申報公會，以彙轉紡管會者，本期將無法參加分配。但聞各公會正在徴集繼續申報，俾得於次期加入。此次之未及加入者，針織染織各業，俱屬不少。前晚針織業公會召開理事會，曾引起未申報會員之責難。經該公會負責人據理解釋，始獲諒解云。帆布業亦爲棉紗複製品工業之一，此次因未及申報，竟致整個未及參加，紡管會負責人表示，本期決無辦法，下期當可加人。則下期配數，常可增加</p>
<p>資格審查</p>
<p>各棉紗複製品工業同業公會所組織之配紗委員會係對於紡管會行文時所需之聯合機構。至於各業內部，仍歸各業自理。惟問某負責人曾主張：組織聯合調査組，俾各業得互相監督。其調査組之人員，將多至數十人云。又聞此次配紗，吳市長曾嚴論不得轉賣。其配紗委員會各重要份子，亦以此爲極不放鬆之工作。將與紗業市塲聯絡消息，以資糾察。至於各業內部，原已奉紡管會之命，設立審査組，就原有申報册子，重行審査。預料將有不少之工廠，爲其公會指正錯誤。惟前爲紡建取消配售資格之工廠，如査係與紗號對掉支數，並非以轉賣牟利爲目的。且目下仍在開工，確屬需紗者，仍將予以配售。</p>
<p>銀根將緊</p>
<p>此次配紗一萬二千餘件，價款總額在二百億以上，而紡管委會限於三數日內繳淸。此在市塲銀根上所關至巨。手工棉織曁針織等業，不乏資本薄弱，週　能力較低之廠。曾屢向各該公會表示配紗期數必須分散，繳款日期必須放長，各該公會己轉商複製品工業合組之配紗委員會，設　改善。據云紡建與民營紗廠之聯合配紗，原　每星期三次，今改爲一次，顯未顧及承配各業之困難。如不亟加改良，將使吳市長之原有方針，失去眞意云。</p>
<h3>紗廠業節電辦法　工資及日夜班成問題</h3>
<p>本市人口稠密，工廠林立，電力消耗量，原已達飽和點，市府爲兼籌並顧起見，業與電力公司商妥節電辦法，據悉，全市紗廠分成六組，以六星期爲循環週，即上二星期爲四天七夜，中二星期爲五天七夜，末二星期爲六天七夜，勞方以，夜工增多，工作辛苦，曾經會同資方向社會局申請，規定七夜夜工，改作八工半工資計算，夜工時因電力關係，做作九小時，（原定工作十小時）工資照給，九小時以下者，比例减半發給，日工如祗能做足九小時，槪付九。五工資云。</p>
<p>又本市紗廠自奉行電力支配新辦法後，原有日夜兩班之時間，自應有所更動，惟若干不明事理之工人，認爲工作加重，收入無增，（指星期日休息，工資照給。）於是嘖有煩　，旣拒調夜工，復搶做日班，因而工廠秩序混亂，新申五廠，七廠及緯通紗廠，俱有工潮，恒豐及永安一廠亦遭波及，旋經社會局總工會等勸導調處，除　通廠尙有若千細節未曾談妥外，其餘各廠，均已照常開工。</p>
<h3>本市議價制度先從日用品着手</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自物價逐步上漲，一般市民生活，大受威脅，市參議會開會時，關於抑平物價之方案，曾經　體決定，送請市政府辦理，市政府對於一般民生日用之物品，決儘先着手，除紡織管委會，由吳市長自兼主任委員，積極推進外其他如食糖·棉布·毛絨綫·食米·食汕等，均已飭由社會局分別組織委員會，實行議價，其食糖一項，並已決定配給，其配給證業已印刷就緒，於上週六送交民政處，轉發各區公所普遍分發，實行期已不在遠。</p>
<h3>燃料管理委員會　下月調整煤價工廠用煤價不變</h3>
<p>經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會，因各地產區之煤礦工人待遇已數度改善，且運　情形不甚良好，致成本激增，擬於下月一日起調整各項燃料配售價格，其中除國營民營工廠申請用煤，其售價不變外，此外將酌量提高百分之七十至一百，該會於八月間所訂配售價格中，民營企業將較國營企業高三分之一，今後統以企業性質之異同分類，國營民營同一售價，該會現主要配售對象爲自來水公司，電力公司，輪船，工廠，煤球廠，目前每噸煤成本須十萬元，該會經常工作，乃以配與各工廠中所得盈餘，以補充對其他公用事業上之　損云。</p>
<h3>僞儲券收兌額　共達四灣億有奇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關係方面消息：僞中儲券之收兌額，　去年十一月初起，至本年三月杪止，共計爲四，二一五，七一五，〇八九，六二五·六一元。後當局爲顧全執有該項僞鈔，而仍未及時兌換法幣者之利益計，又定於本年九月一日至同月卅日，繼　登　收兌。共計　額爲二七，四六四，一九九，三八二·五一元。兩項收兌額之　計爲四，二四三，一七九，二八九，〇〇八·一二元。較僞中儲銀行所宣佈之發行總額，仍見超出。惟此項、收兌總額中已將僞僞鈔，悉數剔除云，</p>
<h3>箇舊錫滯銷</h3>
<p>〔本報昆叫廿七日電〕簡舊大錫生產，以不敷成本甚鉅，且銷路停滯，數月來，幾有崩潰之勢，經推舉代表晋省要求，茲悉運銷處對存錫收價已允代向中央請求，擬價爲每噸四百五十萬元，以目前物價計，如大錫每噸能達五百萬元，則生產前途或有　機</p>
<h3>桐油外銷困難·港滬情形相似</h3>
<p>〔香港訊〕華南桐汕業之市况，値此黃葉飄零季節。其凄凉景况亦頗相類，舊有存油復任置變質，現農歷十月，桐油子熟，又常榨油時候，然市上復有大量桐汕，目前市塲竟如此情况，頃據業中人談，歐美兩洲大陸，在需要上，並未有减少，相反的，美國國內且有鬧油漆荒之現象，然而另一方面，我產油地却大批產品廢棄，此矛盾現象，殊令人痛心，目下本市桐油售價，在十六萬以上，爲各地之最昻者，上海方面現約十二萬，漢口亦十二萬强，又美國桐油市價，僅三十五元美余左右，照公賈匯折算，仍不足十二萬元，然由上海運美，連運費等計算在內，成本却非至十六萬元以上不可，若在本市運美，常更不止此歡，存油亦只好任其廄　矣。</p>
<p>本市桐油運銷，木着重於歐陸，但目前亦因上述各種情况，出口殊不合算，我國經八年來抗戰，通貨漲度，比別國亦大，據估計，目前物價，美國的漲紀戰前三倍，我國則在五千倍左右，比較之下，相差額甚鉅，故美貨雖昻貴，而輸入中國仍覺其廉，國內物品雖賤，而輸出國外則感其昻，桐油出口，因之不能例外。</p>

<h3>浙江種業　商討改進辦法</h3>
<p>浙省蠶　權業協會，近舉行第二次會員大會，出席會員數十人，省政府·建設廳·省黨部·中國蠶絲公司·中國農民　行·省社會處均派員指導。主席徐淡人報吿一年來業務槪况，並指出如何改進蠶種方策四點；（一）種廠與絲廠合作、（二）本年秋種失敗因素；（三）製種技術改良；（四）請農行多放貸款。嗣請　設廳蔣科長·中蠶公司蘇浙皖收繭主任朱新予等致詞，對秋種產　過少的原因，提出檢討及供獻意見頗詳。詞畢，即討論：（一）原　設法自供自給；（二）春種貸款之進行；（三）　管冷藏庫；（四）春種價格決定諸案。</p>
<h3>染料到銷兩稀　德孚貨存底太薄代用品不受歡迎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據染料業巾人談稱：該業平日營業，十之七八，係特殊帮定貨。茲者交通不暢，外帮採辦亦呈呆滯。本埠方面，銷數有限。且純視需要最股之綢緞棉布兩業情形盛衰而定。然近來該兩業並無甚榮辱。次以染料之供應而言，外帮客大都用慣德孚洋行之獅馬牌，開到之定貨單，十九皆指定德孚之貨。雖同種類同品質之外貨，仍不見樂用。茲因德孚洋行淸理處，每週所能配出之貨不多。且存底又日趨　薄。進口方面，則以各國復員伊始，染料產量甚少。自顧尙且不暇，可能輸出之染料，常極有限。而一方面船隻又極缺乏，到貨遂少。故染料之正常供應，尙無把握。八月間外匯調整後，本市各檔染料，雖曾普遍漲價六成至一倍，惟營業仍床見起色。加以各地交通未復，染料供應不暢等難關重重，該業之近况，僅稱平淡無奇而已。</p>
<h3>蠶繭繅折太重日繭三担可繅一担</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關人士吿記者；我國絲業之復興，因戰時損失慘重，極爲艱難；即使在政府全力協助下，至少尙需兩年之時間，始能恢復戰前之生產量。蠶種之改良，爲當前重要任務之一。如與日本相比較，日繭三祖可出絲一担，我國必需四担，品種方面，顯然落後。又悉日本之原繭，因對方保守秘密甚嚴，難於獲致。</p>
<h3>競爭激烈購買力薄弱　南貨業亦陷苦境</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市南貨業公會負責人近吿記者。本市經營南貨業者，以貨物類別而分，糖爲大宗，其次爲海味與桂圓。以食糖而論，資力雄厚　營採辦之號家，不下七家；經營批發之行家，在一百家之上。經營海味業之行家，在二百家以上。恃賣買桂圓過活之行，亦有六十多家。糖之來源，過去最大部份來自爪哇，品質最好，其七十斤之甜味，可與他種糖一百斤相比，故有「七折糖」之俗稱。惟自勝利以來，因船隻缺乏，來貨不多。次等糖來自台灣及福建，台糖在日本人時代，曾加精煉，潔白美觀，據云參有牛骨粉，故有「葷糖」之稱。自我國接收台灣後，台糖即呈灰黯之色，雜質亦甚豐富。本市糖之售價，最高者約爲十九萬元一担，最低者約十一萬元。目前社會局評價者，即爲台糖中之中砂生砂兩種。食糖雖爲必需品，但抽稅甚重。在戰前，一包糖之成本爲四元，但糖稅則爲八元。在今日，平均計算，食糖一包需抽稅六萬元左右。海味中本國貨不多，限於鮮魚，來自福建，大宗爲英國貨。以桂圓而論，福建貨甚好，來自厦門者較差。今年桂圓爲荒年，來貨不多。以上三種南貨，均以上海爲　散地。經　南貨　者無　需極大資本，亦不如經營工業之困難，但亦有其本身之問題：（一）銷路不暢，原因爲購買力薄弱。同時南貨中除　糖之外，並非必需品；再則近來新開之南貨店甚多，競爭亦烈。因之，南貨店在　中秋以後，生意不佳。（二）高利貸之威脅亦大，利息高至一角六七分。（三）爲零售商及消費者之利益，最好由號家成立一「採辦商同業公會」，直接向生產地點採購，如此力可以避免中間人之剝削。</p>
<h3>當前農村「資金」與「勞力」問題之嚴重性</h3>
<p>— 章柏菴</p>
<p>比年以來，因戰事關係，農村人力，早已成爲嚴重問題，勝利以後，若干因戰事荒蕪之土地，重新除荒；惟農村勞力昂貴，耕農生產資金短絀，生產成本因之愈趨愈高，『樂歲終身苦，　年不免於死亡』眞可爲此時此地農村之寫照，吾人欲明瞭當前農村衰頺癥結之所在，則不外二點，一曰農村生產資金之短紬；二曰農村勞力恐慌之嚴重。茲分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）農村生產資金之枯竭我國農村，幅員廣大，以最古代之生產方式，站立於二十世紀之科學時代，而都市又爲廣大農村之吸血管，故遠在十年甘年以前，即聞農村有崩潰之聲。八年之苦戰，農村之元氣更加斷喪，加以獸　所至，廬舍爲墟，欲謀農村之蘇復，實非數十年不可，而處此現實農村狀况之下。農村資金，焉得不短。資金枯竭，生產隨之减縮，農事受自然季節之限制，每遇需要「資金」之時，十九無處融通，即幸而能融通到，必先將未來之農作物作爲放款之抵押品，近年以來，農仃對農貸舉辦之努力，對農村似有部份之實惠，但以有限之資金，供廣大之農村，不免有滄海一粟之感。若以農貸之實際而言，眞正耕農之能融通國家資金者，恐爲數甚少，誠如蔣百里先生所謂中國人的事，只能用望遠鏡看，不能用顯微鏡看，萬事皆然，「農貸」又何能例外。更就農產收穫而論，目前種植稻田，本年天時得宜，收成甚豐，假定每畝稻田收成米爲二石（作者按：江南一帶，本來每畝稻田，普通可收二石五斗，但因近年來，施肥减少，人力未盡充分，故二石之數，已爲最高之理想收成）其間，時間要三個月，投下資金要人工十個，每工以三千元計，則爲三萬元肥料種籽約須二萬元，共爲五萬元，而收成米二石，現按產地價爲每石糙米三萬五千元，共爲七萬元，另加稻草收入二千元合計爲七萬二千元，以三個月之時間，五萬元之資金，得七萬二千元之收成，是則每畝稻田，平均收入爲七千元，此尙係指自耕農而言，如爲佃農，還過租米以外，所餘能有幾何？是故本年度，上海一埠來自農村之苦力日多。</p>
<p>（二）農村人力恐慌之　重性苦守家園，本爲我農胞萬死不移之艱苦精神，即在戰時，烽火連天，農民非萬不得己，莫不固守其田園　墓。勝利以後，何以紛紛棄田流浪呢？　問題是値得硏究的。第一：由於農村的死亡綫上，實在再也不能掙扎下去，要務農使使只有死亡，要死亡不如往都市流浪，由是農村人口，大大地移到了都市，都市生活雖艱，但比農村要高出萬倍，這現象是非常可怕，第二：常前農村社會，由於基層政治之不健全，常使農民無法再受重重的榨取，這是事實。第三：生產資金殆盡，惟有棄之不顧，改絃易轍，以上三個問題，厥爲農村人口移動之最大原因，可是由農村人口之移往都市，致使農村勞力更加昂貴，生產量與生產率更加退後，這簡直是農村的總崩潰的前夕。</p>
<p>工商衰落，民生日艱，根本問題，還要看蘇復農村之努力如何？否則任何挽救辨法，是想不出來的。</p>
<h3>開拓絲市場派員赴印度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巾蠶公司於最短期內，將派員赴印度進行聯絡工作，並謀開展外銷市塲。有關人士吿記者：印度爲生絲外銷最有希望之市塲。因印度戰前所用之生絲中，日貨甚多，我國如能接收此部份市塲，爲數即甚可觀。其次爲今日印度市塲上之絲價，較之歐美各國均高，我國如能大量輸出，常然有利。惟認爲遺憾者，即抗戰方勝利時，有一批投機商人，以品質最劣之陳絲四千餘包，售與印商，使我國之商業信用，爲之喪失殆盡。目前印商即使訂貨，亦爲一二百包之小數，大量根本不敢。此次派員赴印，即在解釋誤會，並謀印度市塲之開拓。</p>
<h3>中信局標售紗布</h3>

<h3>私貨礙及火柴業　目前產量僅及戰前之六成　競爭太烈但品質已有進步</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關方面吿記者：本市火柴工業之生產量，目前僅及戰前百分之六十左右。减產之主要理由，爲競爭太烈，而銷路欠佳。因自民國三十年之後，本市成立之小廠甚多，其出品之生產成本較低，故在農村中甚爲暢銷。據該業公會方面之統計，本市有規模之火柴廠，共二十四家，以大中華及大明爲最大，登記資本各爲一萬萬元。其餘有歷史之火柴廠，登記資本額皆在五百萬至五千萬元之間。至於各廠生產確數，公會方面尙在調査中，本市火柴出品之銷路，以京滬綫爲主，有一部份運銷北方。據該業人士談，目前火柴之品質，較戰前略有進步。外人在　設火柴廠者，美人有美光公司，出品有玫塊樹及車輪牌火柴，瑞典人設有瑞中洋行，出品有鳳凰牌火柴。兩廠均有悠久之歷史，規模宏大，惟因其不加人同業公會，其生產額不詳。火柴之進一口貨不多，一部份爲善後救濟物資，在市上標賣，此外有大量不貼印花之火柴出售，即爲走私品。以火柴之原料而論，戰時一度堪以自給，本市曾有上海火柴原料廠之設立；今日海道復通，美貨大量湧至，此廠已停辦。目前火柴業所希望者，爲切實取締走私，以維護正常商業。</p>
<h3>華僑復業貸款抗敵者有優先權</h3>
<p>査抗戰期間，我海外各地僑胞，直接問接參加祖國，或協助當地抗敵工作者，爲數甚夥，而其中因此而傾家蕩產者，爲數亦不少，爲表揚民族正氣，獎勵忠貞，我政府對在敵人佔領期間內，曾有貢獻之僑胞擬就華僑復業貸款辦法，有享受優先貸款之權利，中國國民黨駐曼谷直屬支部，接獲中央海外部京海三（35）字一一三三號代電，對該辦法有所說明，茲抄錄原電如下，駐海外各級黨部均鑒，據菲律濱總支部呈請，准予海外遭受家產沒收之僑胞，享有優先貸款權利等情，業經函准財政部卅五年四月十三日財錢乙字第一七六七六號公函復開，「査自華僑復業貸款辦法公布施行後，本部爲獎勵在敵人佔領期內，對於抗敵工作有貢獻之華僑起見，經核定優先貸款順序如次，（一）凡華僑在敵人佔領期內，　直接加祖國或當地抗敵工作者，（二）曾間接參加協助祖國或當地抗敵工作者，（三）不與敵人合作者，至曾參加敵僞組織或有附敵嫌疑者，均不予貸款，以上情形，應由海外各領事館依照華僑復　貸款辦法第四條規定，對於電　貸款之華僑，分別予以證明，由承辦銀行，依照辦理，業經分行照辦在案，茲准前由，相應函復査照轉知爲荷」，等由到部，除指復外，特電達知照，幷希轉吿各同志僑胞一體知照爲要，中央海外部世印。</p>
<h3>印度政府微收　原棉出口稅　每包二十廅比</h3>

<h3>日繭運會尚未就緒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日繭運華問題，因數量價格尙未獲致協議，故中蠶負責人迄未成行。目前此事仍由朱世明氏全力折衝中，如日繭運華不能實現，我國絲廠將普遍　工半年；如數量低於一千萬磅時，亦將有局部之停工。第三區（蘇浙皖區）繅絲公會理事長褚輔成，已　請政府注意，務必力爭日繭運華，以挽回繅絲業之危機</p>
<h3>美木材出口減少</h3>

<h3>十二碼球幾成不歡　東華勝龍傑小將　結果二比一龍傑經驗稍差　不服裁判判決勸阻續賽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕甲組足球賽第二幕，東華老將昨下午戰龍傑新軍於逸園，東華憑其戰場經驗，卒將龍傑擊退，結果二比一，上半時東華以一比零佔先。龍傑小將究以經驗不如，相形之下，東華穩健有餘，龍傑雖年青力壯，以久踢小型足球關係，地位及踢法，均有改進之必要，前鋒力量亦差，惟作戰甚爲努力，假以時日，殊有希望也。觀眾欲知新軍究係如何隊伍，故紛至沓來，球迷亦有三四千人。</p>

<p>十二碼球　易地之後，龍傑以沈錦達代出章九清，龍傑先攻，王步榮一射成野，龍海射門，被盛彼得救出，龍傑否極泰來，十分鍾時，王步榮擲界外球，高秀清單槍匹馬，建功而返，扳成一對一平手。此後東華攻勢雖頻，均以功虧一簣，直至四十二分鍾時，龍傑周永芳禁區犯手球，被判十二碼，東華譚福楨操刀，一蹴而入，惟此時龍傑隊員認爲手球係在罰球區外，不應判罰十二碼球，擬即離場，幸主幹崔世富深明大義，勸令入場重賽，未幾法定時間己屆，東華以二比一小勝龍傑。</p>

<p>在曩年茶市鼎盛的時候，新茶剛開園，茶號即動員搜購，茶未製完竣，即被號家爭先秤買，不稍停留，茶戶年恃此項經常收入的大宗，正可維持它們農作的資本，全縣一年茶價的總收入，比本地任何一種土產，都够不上如茶龐大的數額，所謂有恒產者有恒心，茶農一年握此可靠的恒產，對於茶園的載培，施肥，拓展茶地，都聚精會神的一致向那靑青的茶樹上盡最大的辛力，都熱望着生產增加，近年的精彩，合與過去相反，製就的茶葉，　置無人問津，肩負叫賣，沽值不償茶本，所謂無恒產者無恒心，這樣一來，使它對茶　的　怨，不得不　向另找生產的別途，這是自然的趨向，絲毫不帶些勉强可能性的。</p>
<p>內外銷</p>
<p>茶葉向分洋莊和本莊兩　，洋莊箱茶銷歐美，本莊簍茶銷國內，從前洋莊箱茶出口，的佔產額十分之九，本莊僅佔十分之一，近年外銷出路，既告滯塞，在抗戰時，盛銷杭滬津漢的徽茶市塲，無法輸出應銷，本莊店購的簍茶，亦僅銷於未淪陷區各埠，且進胃很微，敵區雖有提價　購徽產茶葉，惟本邑商人，却不敢幹此走　私冒險的嘗試，製就的茶葉，祗有任其擱置發霉，不另找尋出路。抗戰勝利後，內外的銷路，依舊還是呈疲，並沒有好轉的生氣。本縣洋莊茶號今年的銷量，祇有二三千担，內地店莊銷場，還比往年狹小，即本地向稱胃納最大的協和昌茶號，今歲亦只進茶三百餘担，其他零星茶販的收辦，數更細微。現在合灣紅綠茶和日本茶，均有大宗產額，向外傾銷，成本俱比華茶輕廉，看目前婺綠的內外銷路，前途或將更趨黯淡，亦未可知。</p>
<p>茶號乏本</p>
<p>本縣曩年茶號，全邑不下三百家，每一茶號，只須自己有了現資萬元，再向茶棧貸款一二萬元，即可開塲製茶二三百箱，了此一年營業，因爲那時茶價低廉，一担茶値，只二三十元，每號進茶三百担，只需茶價萬元，其餘人工伙食原料運費亦只要萬餘元，每家茶號資本，大的（箱額多的）四五萬，少至一二萬元，且多獨資經營，絕少合股的組織，現在茶價提高，每担要十萬元內外，辦茶百担，即　　本千萬元，每一茶號，至少辦茶二百担，即需資本二千萬元，再加錫購，箱板，紙張，粉靛，原料，製茶，揀茶，焙茶，篩做，人工，裝茶運費四千萬元，進茶二百担的茶號，需資本總額六千萬元，本縣茶商的資力薄弱，對目前茶號的經營，只有望着興嘆！</p>
<p>政府雖有茶貸放出，穩愼茶商，以它利率太高，辦法限制甚嚴，領了茶貸，即須製茶，如成本增重，茶葉滯銷，限期本息，必至不能　還，若長期認息，必至本盡　累，現在茶號之不敢開場者，都因自己缺少籌碼，實有袖短難舞的苦衷。</p>
<p>市價拿升</p>
<p>每做一種經營，必須計算自己貨物的成本，方可進行交易，從前本色茶價，每担只需二三十元，茶農猶有微利可沾，本年茶價已提漲至十萬元，茶晨　是認爲無利益，不顧慮耗辛力來做茶，茶號進茶一担，　本十萬元，加上人工原料運費，每担茶需本三十萬元，以現在滬市售　，最高的茶，尚未到此價值，沾利二字，更談不上，若求滿足茶農的慾望，每担茶値，增價至二十萬元，原料人工，勢必隨之步漲，是每茶一担，非售價至百萬元，是絕對無利可沾的，百萬一担的茶價，恐怕　觀世界上任河一種土產，決沒有這樣的高値，今後茶業貿易如能轉機，茶葉的身價，最好還需降低，以求减輕成本爲第一着，試從生產銷費國外市塲看到婺源茶葉的出路，最低估計，將來茶價，決無提升可能。</p>
<p>未來茶業</p>
<p>每一產貨出品，經若千的時期，必有一說變，婺茶置易，已有二百餘年的歷史，遭茲厄運，或許是轉到蛻變的時期，然一試測它蛻變原因，是有跡象可尋的，婺源山地土壤，並未改變，茶葉的色香味，亦絲毫沒有變質，「祁紅」「婺綠」的美名，他茶是不容許冒牌掠美的。</p>
<p>它的不能日新月盛，與外茶不　抗衡於市場的原因，是在人事上未盡到力量和改良的新知，（一）茶農對栽培不加辛力，施以有效的培養，和適合茶性的長養。（二）茶戶採茶，揉茶，焙茶諸方法，大多急求近功，貪圖容易，不加工採嫩精製，甚至有蠻摘，烘坯，晒　的變劣陋習，（三）茶號資本短小，沒有大規校公司的組織，製法裝璜，多是减工陋料，不謀改進，（四）茶機只知經紀　利，無深謀遠　的競爭，（五）政府無低　豆貸的資助，和切合實際的管理，並缺乏專門技術人才帮同改進。</p>
<p>以世界稀有的天然特產品，自己不知珍護重視，一任它自生自滅，無怪茶市的崦嵫日薄，難步上國際市塲的坦途·今後欲挽回茶業的頽勢，須政府和茶農茶商茶工一致的努力，通曉出口的茶葉，對國家是如何的有利，對茶農茶商茶工是什麽的利害關係，如何改進製植，使生產增加茶質臻美，用何種方法能與外茶抗衡，自己明白了這四重點，庶幾沉埋的茶市，或有恢復繁榮的希望，否則未來的市面，徒供茶人仰觀的海市幻景，虛無的希望，並不能給予我們實現的成功。</p>
<h3>十三軍在熱河　守必固攻必克　打老鼠如打老虎</h3>
<p>— 十六日航訊　子佳寄自承德</p>
<p>承德是淸帝避暑勝地，爲推行邊　政策，在此興建離宮以及規模宏大的八個喇嘛寺，雖幾經變亂，模遭破壞，而畫閣雕樑猶在，惟已破落寂寥，而高聳入雲的六合塔，蜿蜒甘里的宮墻，蒼翠挺秀的古松，殘荷滿池的如意洲，仍依稀當年盛况。在　碑　　間，正　危坐，深感古意盎然。如意渊北端一處石砌的長方池塘，相傳爲熱河，雖隆冬而其水不凍，熱河之名也許由是而起的。</p>
<p>東北之後方華北的屏障</p>
<p>熱河係內蒙一都，歷代外患侵入的墊脚石。它的位置在長城之外，陰山山　橫貫其中，與華北的心臟平津結</p>
<p>爲　齒，外蒙獨立，非但不足爲巾蘇間的綏衝地帶，而使內蒙在國防上的地位益加重要。山海關·喜峯口·古北口·爲出入長城的孔道，熱河是東北與關內的走廊，兼任了東北的後方，華北的屛障。</p>
<p>熱河是貧瘠的省份，因氣候與土質的關係，不能列爲主要的產糧區，而阜新北票之煤，赤峯圍塲之皮毛，亦可資國防上之需用。阜新北票煤礦，在日人佔領期間，已大量開採，爲僅次於撫順的重要　工區。此處之火電力，遠超過陪都重慶的所發的電力。足供數百里各城鎮使用，此外，遍地產煤和埋藏地下的金·銀··鉛·鋅·鐵礦·藥材·木材·高梁等物產，亦不可忽視。省內以錦（州）·古（北口）·葉（柏壽）·赤（峯）·兩鐵道構成主要交通網，此兩錢在軍事上價値，遠勝於商業上之價値。境內各重要城鎭，均可通公路，軍運民用極稱便利，全省面積十九萬餘方公里，居住着的六百萬人口，其中有八十萬蒙民，行政上漢蒙「分治」「合治」，屢經改革，至今尙無定局。外蒙古獨立，與中共導演下的所謂「東蒙自治」的怪劇後，這少數民族問題，益形複雜，似尙未至嚴重階段。一般民衆本極窮苦，經日人十二年的壓榨，中共一年的「德政」，衣食住行，在在都成問題，且已面臨嚴重階段，以高梁。小米。馬鈴薯爲主要食糧，經共軍大量徵收，已呈遍地糧荒，尤其衣着缺乏，幾不蔽體，兒童大都裸體，甚至闔家共穿一褲，一人外出，全家祇好閉門睡覺。</p>
<p>蘇兵帶八路共軍運代表</p>
<p>日軍進入熱河，耶劃入「僞滿」版圖，一切設施悉與東北相同。初示寬大，繼而利用警察嚴格統制，至今人民對警察仍談虎變色。去年「八一五」，日本投降，蘇軍由外蒙而入，敵偽物資，人民財產，相隨而去者不少。其軍紀在人民心中，留下極深刻之印象，同時帶來了「人民的軍隊」——八路軍，都是赤手空拳，背着包袱，口口聲聲抗戰八年，擊潰敵人，「難道打仗不用武器祇憑嘴說嗎」，人民對八路軍發生了第一個疑問。八路軍的武器，在關外扌配備的。在「民主」口號之下，曾舉行「民選主席」，中共黨員李運昌發表「保護熱河人民生命財產的安全」的宣言，當時情形殊難明瞭，大槪未必有其他政黨參加精選，曾用汽車運來所「各縣人民代表」參加選舉，當場舉手表決，李　昌當選熱河省主席，以後的「門爭」。「淸算」，人民生命財產的安全都成了問題，否定了自己的諾貫，國車收復承德，「民選省府」一說北移，一說南遷，莫衷一是，以「縣不離縣，鄕不　郷」的原則來推斷，當然「省也不離省」，反正在此省中，山多不知處</p>
<h3>熱河人民　對共軍四句評語　刀子的心·豆腐的嘴　小皮的肚·兔子的腿</h3>
<p>一向在政府統治區域裏的同胞，對「解放區」是個謎，究竟是「天堂」抑是「地獄」？一到新收很區裏，便可知道，全熱河的同胞，有口皆碑，在復員整軍中積極「擴軍」，「獻糧」，和軍隊寄食民家，把「减租减息」的宣傳打了嘴吧，無限制的「獻」，共軍土兵在民家不給價的吃便飯，把人民吃成赤貧，「淸算」即是亘古使有的大貪汚案，每次「淸算」，除田地房屋傢俱分給貧民，其餘現款細軟獻給「政府」，入了私囊。在共軍裏，共產　員吃白麵，月給豬肉七斤，以示優待，這樣的政黨，也是見所未見，聞所未聞的。玩得最漂亮的一手要算破壞，不論鐡路，公路，共產，礦區，電燈，電話，一切公共建築，富戶，房屋，莫不加以破壞，據說破壞是爭取民主的手段。日人佔領時經營的鐡路工　業，不論在軍事政治民生上都有保留的價值，現在留下的，衹是　　一片，這種行動使愛國者所不解的，共軍的士兵大都出於強迫而來的，監視極嚴，不能散開作戰，所以每每採用夜　，密集衝鋒，共軍的指揮官攻堅的唯一戰法，把士兵驅向國軍的火網中，往往在機關槍前伏屍纍纍，共軍逃風極熾，所以戰鬥力消耗於逃亡的更多於傷亡的。「解放區」的人民不聾不啞，自有公論。祗是呼聲太微弱，熱河流行着四句對中共的評語：「刀子的心，豆腐的嘴，小皮的肚，兎子的腿」。</p>
<p>熱河也是論陷了十二年的地方，政府的接收完全是武裝進行的，接收人員跟着軍隊前進，政府機關倉庫王廠人民，都曾「解放」，已成十室九空，接收財產，早落人他人之乎，留下一片正待復與的破碎城市和農村。自從一月間國軍踏入熱河到一月十三日停戰爲止，先頭祇到平泉，所接收的僅爲朝不保夕的一條鐡道綫。省政府的政令離不開鐡道，　政府的政令出不了城門，四鄉仍有所謂「抗日政權」的存在。行政機關人員祇在軍隊駐區活動，打下了之後接收的基礎，戰局上得了轉機，一速收復了承德，圍塲，赤峯，密城各綫，敢復區擴展了，行政人員受到新擴展的刺激，配合着軍事行動，展開了新的接收工作，行政效率顯然比半年前進步得多了。</p>
<p>一把有力的長槍插入熱河腹地掩護東北與華北間走廊</p>
<p>這裏的國軍最多時曾有四個半師，最少時衹有一個第十三軍，它在這殘迫艱難困苦的環境支持了大半年，這枝勁旅美械新裝生氣勃勃，在百靈廟，南口忻口台兒莊，赣北，鄂南，鄂北，鄂西，黔南，桂柳，梧穗，得地，留下了輝煌的戰績，一向站在國防的最前綫，抗戰八年，遍歷塞外黃河，長江，珠江流域各戰塲，沒有在那裏住着整訓過，他們訓　的機會，是作戰和長遠酷署的行軍。去年十一月中旬，叩開山海關的大門，第一個踏進淪陷十四年的東北，一口氣收復了綏中　　，　定接收東北的基礎，今年的一月　着風雪，收復　縣和　新北票兩大礦區，正向北進中，突然作了一個九十度的左　　，像閃電似的進了熱河的腹地。剛到平泉，便接到停戰命令，停止前進。一個軍提了東自　武，本新，經北票，古山，朝陽，　柏壽，凌源，乃至平泉，長達干餘里的一字長蛇陣，便不懂軍事的人也替他揑把汗。其實這並不是一條　　　一橡的綫，而是插入熱河腹部的一把長　，掌握了華北和東北間的交通，掩護着東北和華北的走廊，停戰後，經承德赤峰朝陽三小組調處舉行過兩次國共雙方指揮官的會談，都沒有成果，區區兩軍隔離問題，蕭克便費了多少心機口舌，歪曲事實強詞　理的爭執，從此看出共軍對「停戰」「和平」的成份。綏靖區司令官　　十三軍軍長石覺將軍打仗的老手，他不聲不　便先完成「立於不敗之寺」的處置。果如所　，五月中共軍糾集了十七　　旅十萬之衆，發動「五月攻勞」　企圖把這條長陣節節切斷，然後各地吃掉。民間散佈出駭人　　流言，各城市的人民都起了　　慌經過二十天的戰門，共軍先後國　　古山，北票，朝陽，葉柏　，凌源，不泉所有通信交通完全破壞。第十三軍在各要點上發揮出他的威力，共軍攻勢頓挫了，在古山戰鬥七晝夜，北票戰鬥三晝夜，共軍所獲的代價是本身慘重的傷亡，人民的恐慌消除了，對國軍信服了，這些激烈戰鬥的消息，向來是在閉鎖着的。十三軍的將士並不抱怨，他們抱有無名爲大犧牲自我的精神，而且紋平內亂中的赫赫戰果並不足以誇耀的。熱河共軍經過這一次敎訓，便對十三軍低了　，在共軍中　行說：「　願打××軍一　，不願打十三軍一邁」，這是　敎過錢　後的老實話。戰鬥力的强弱，祗有敵手扌是一個公正的評判負。共軍破壞停戰協定，圍攻大同，國軍發動反擊，熱河方面非常神速的一舉收復承德，隆化，　平，　　　再舉而收復園塲，多倫，沽　　共軍損失綦重，望風而逃。十三軍守必固，攻必克，但並不驕矜經敵。他們作戰的要訣：打老　要和打老虎一樣」穩紥，猛打，窮追，保持嚴謹的作風。</p>
<p>十三軍是收復熱河的主力，他們的服裝樸素，他們的精神極飽滿，河南弟兄佔了多數，全軍上下充滿着淳厚誠樸的風氣，和民衆打成一片，民衆愛戴忠勇的軍隊，帮助他們修路，讓房屋給他們住，他們不要民聞一章一木，軍民間沒有半點隔聞。</p>

<h3>秋行春令在錫常</h3>
<p>— ·甘一日無錫訊　高武弘·</p>
<p>快要到「秋盡江南」的日子了。在「秋」波臨去之際，，記者想來寫這麼一　不失時效的通訊，不過，要聲明本文是把無錫與武進合寫在一起的，並不分寫，以省篇幅。</p>
<p>先來一個插曲：月前，睛園裏的「壘花一現」，曾使武進城起了一個小小的　動。這幾天第三區小河鎭河南王家村王氏宗祠後面空塲上的一株杏樹，突然又吐蕊怒放，滿樹開　了銀白色的花朶，透出陣陣清香，杏樹在秋天開放，大家都引爲怪事，記者曾　車往觀，惜未帶有照相機，未能將開花的情形拍攝下來，誠爲憾事。記者聽到老畫家錢小安先生說：「壘花一現，杏花秋開，這都不是佳兆，國家久亂不靖，人民似乎還有難臨頭吧！」秋風落葉聲中，聽到這話，有些使人惴惴自危。</p>
<p>太湖地區，久爲盜匪出沒之所，人民受害匪綫。政府當局，一再寬仁爲　，給予此　目新機會，但　不畏法的亡命之徒，仍　國不已。京滬衝戌局令部爲此　特設立無錫指揮所，及各淸剿區指揮官，先行勸導招撫，招　不成，則予以淸剿，捕獲後立以軍法訊決執行，么魔小魏，想和堂堂義師相抗，那正是以卵擊石！擁有新式武器，流竄於吳縣，吳江，崑山，青浦四縣交界處的巨匪李德孚，曁羽黨曁候明清羅英二人，因抗不投誠，終於爲官方在圍剿時擒獲，於十六日在蘇州　門望樹墩正法。</p>
<p>共軍的內部，也漸漸地在動搖，分化，一般頭腦淸晰的中下級幹部，都覺悟到自己一時受到主義上的煽惑，做了國家和民族的罪人，作爲少數人鬥爭的工具，所以一有機會，都紛紛投誠。武進共黨政委吳思鑑，已向當局投誠。匪方錫東「縣長」陳學良，已向無錫縣長徐淵若接洽過，徐縣長限陳於二十二日前「自首」。奸匪中有少數執迷不悟者，即以兵力全面淸剿，務於短期內肅淸匪患，澈底綏綏靖三區，決不予以寬容。</p>
<p>日前又有一學徒出身的中共華中分局二地委錫城特派員南通人梁鴻，因目覩共黨破壞和平，欺騙靑年的陰謀，且感激主席仁慈和政府寬大，率同部下朱大川，羅燁（女）等十餘人，向無錫指揮所投誠自新，並發表脫黨宣言，歷述共黨罪惡，勸導受主義炫惑的青年，從速覺悟，宣言後並附共黨華中局對江南工作指示，文長數千言，一二兩節對主席及當前局勢作歪曲的　　與宣傅，以下指示江南皖南共軍和游擊隊的總任務，是發動廣大羣衆力量，積極展開羣衆游擊戰爭，消戰爭分爲二種：（一）集結比較强大的主力部隊，在江南皖南邊境作大規模的游擊；必要時向浙西發展，同時建立較大，較好或較小，較固的根據地。（二）在太湖茅山等地區，發動分散的游擊小組，此外在廣大的江西地區——不能展開武裝鬥爭的地區，進行羣衆工作，發展黨的秘密工作，放手發動各種各式的羣衆鬥爭。</p>
<p>從這件事上，我們可以看到共軍擾亂地方，破壞和平的狠心辣手；同時，可看到中共的中下級幹部，是怎樣的紛紛動搖，不安於黨。中共的命運，也像梧桐樹上枯黃的葉子一樣，一陣風，一陣雨，就會把它們紛紛打落呢！</p>
<p>參議員名額之爭</p>
<p>無錫縣參議員選舉，短期內就將實行，其名額亦經縣府分配，但各方面對於分配的數額，都表示示滿，這幾天正在展開劇烈的爭論。自由職業團體，僅配得一名，該業所屬記者，律師，醫師等各單位，咸認爲有欠公允，已　　縣府考慮增加。</p>
<p>爭執最白熱化的，是縣商會和總工會，縣商會於舉行第十八次理監會議時。論及參議員名額分配問題，認爲：「一切捐稅所出，以工商爲主體，而區域與團體性質，各有不同，現民主時代，設立民意機構，意在求各地區及職業各有合理的代表，職選名額，如不平均分配，商會惟有放棄參加選舉。」會塲意見一致，淡定甘願放棄不予參加。</p>
<p>總工會方面認爲縣府擬定的工會名額，僅係根據該會成立時的會員人數二萬六千名分配。現工會會員，總數已超過四萬名，根據選舉條例第十條後段規定：「參議員名額，應按會員多寡比照分配」。故應得參議員名額猶須增加。堅持縣府按照政府頒佈選舉條例第十條辦理，否則不予參加。農會方面，配到了十二名，也嫌太少，居然也召開一次理監會議，凑成「一窩風」的熱席塲面。理由是：「本縣農民數量，佔絕對多數，縣府所擬本屆參　員職業代表名額共四十三名，本會　得十二名，所佔不足三分之一，應呈縣增加名額，以資合理。」</p>
<p>參議員名額的爭奪戰，這幾天已達於　　熱閙之極，前幾天曾有人依據上海市參議員職選名額分配辦法，（係就農會以鄉鎭農會，工會以產業或職業公會，商會以同榮公會的單位多寡爲分配名額的標準。）函縣府參考。但縣府以此項方式，法無明文，未便減予決定，巳據情電請民政應核示處理辦法。但民衆對於農。工·商會的一龍爭虎鬥」却並不關心，似乎選舉參議員的事，和他們是毫不相關似的。</p>
<p>滿耳一片標會聲</p>
<p>由於社會的普遍性不景氣，生活艱難，「標會」之風最近在武進又大爲盛行，茶坊酒肆，一片標會聲，幾乎沒有一個人不和標會有國。「標會」的方法，也許知道的人很少，記者也直到最近纔弄明白，順便在這裏談一談：先是由一偶人發起，（即「會頭」）邀集相識的親友，凑成一「會」，人數不拘，大槪最少十人，由「會頭」擬定一個數目，如首會定每人繳十萬元，則「會頭」可一次收進九十萬元，第二會起，用投標方式，除「會頭」每次固定繳出十萬元外，其餘九人，將自己擬收的款額寫於一紙上，或五十萬，或六十萬，或七十萬不等，彙集後開標，由數額最小者得「標」，得「標」者的會款，由未得標者照數公擬。得「標」愈後，會款愈大，最合算的，當然是「會頭」，一次收進，分期付出，不要加上一文拆息，所以人人都想做「會頭」，佔一些便宜，於是你也「標會」，我也「標會」，鬧得烏烟瘴氣，鷄犬不寧，有的人竟把「標會」當作了「生財之道」，每天在忙着「標會」。</p>
<p>「標會」，也是一種剝削平民的變相高利貸，有人要做生意，沒有本錢，就請親友幫忙，一標」上一個「會」。但「標會」之風盛　「　會」之風也盛，有些　標得後，竟溜之大吉，這種糾盼，每日總有幾起發生。社會風氣，由不振面陷於墮落，値得當局注意。</p>
<h3>合肥即景</h3>
<p>— 十日合肥訊　竇白萍</p>
<p>記者此次獲得一個機會，由巢縣到　城，事前爲着交通工具的方便，決定取道合肥”同時觀光這安徽的臨時省會。</p>
<p>巢縣合肥間，現在有水陸兩道可通。小輸西行通過巢湖進西口便到合肥，陸路則乘汽車沿淮南鐵路路　西行（淮南鐵路幾時才得通車，尙無所聞）。</p>
<p>在省會　政·治·進·步</p>
<p>合肥，是記者舊遊之地，這座飽經八年憂患的古城，在過去是歷史上的名地，而今兼是安微的政治中心。去年八月勝利後，安徽省會由皖西立煌遷來，關於定省合肥抑是還治安慶，在安徽曾有過激烈的爭辯，有人認爲合肥位居全皖中心，城內地方很大，省會應該設此；另有人認爲以合肥地方面論，不够爲省會的條件，從事建設又非省方及地方財力所及，應該及早還治安慶。於是這個問題曾提交省參議會大會討論，結果決定仍還安慶，但俟省政府財力可及時再行遷移，這就是說原則上遷還安慶，時間土可以伸縮。</p>
<p>現在的合肥，雖是省府遷來已有一年，然而市面上並未繁榮，相反的，顯得蕭條與落寞，電廠迄今仍未恢復，晚來小巷黑得令人却步，商人店面並不比戰前來得繁華，城內只有唯一的）條馬路，那是自省政府通到小東門，其他道街，除了鼓樓一帶商業區爲平板石而外，餘均坎坷不平，走起路來實在靈脚！</p>
<p>自從今春季主席發動「革新運動」以來，據說政治上比校以前略有進步，但是爲點只有在省會所在地成爲眞確，而在外縣的鄕下，據記者所知，收效尙微，這點說明下級幹部還不能對上級負起責任來，譬如說，在「革新運動」中對於貪汚是列爲禁條約，然而貪汚在安徽大概不會比別的省份少，在縣長中就有不少爲了貪汚經過檢舉而垮台的，鄕保長在鄕下更可昂頭闊步找選賬，嘟農敢怒而不敢言，這是過去用現在的理實。</p>
<p>在省會各廳處的公務員，倒是儉樸成風，多數是穿灰布制嚴，佩載機關頒發的符號，他們面目上願現着生活的壓迫，假如一個中級公務員有個四口之家，則十三四萬元的收入就不夠衣食住的開支。如今這裏的物價正在隨風漲，合肥的米漲到每石五六萬元，猪肉和布類，更是狂漲不己，不知它將漲到什麼程度哩！</p>
<p>眼睜睜　墜·入·債·坑</p>
<p>合肥現有省立男女中學各一所，縣中一所，學生大多來自附近各縣，繳費除學雜費外，關於學生伙食方面，完全繳納實物，一個中學生入學時花費總在十三四萬元，一學期至少需費二十萬元，提起這一點，有一個嚴重問題橫在農村裏，而是關係整個國家敎育問題。</p>
<p>經過九年抗戰，我們的農民知識水準提高了，他們知道培植子弟讀書是需要的，雖是今天農村己陷在破產的狀況中，而農村的子弟議露，據記者在若干鄕村綫計，已比戰前多多了。在此情形下，問題就來了，是大家熟知的事實，農村唯一的收入是農產品，主要的是稻　，面子弟學費唯一的來路就在於此。今年學校開學時，新榖一萬元一担，如果學生入學時需要十五萬元，就得出賣十五擔新榖，要是一個入口之家收榖百擔的農民一（事實上在一般鄉村裏收榖百担者實在太多了）。要是支配一年的捐費，口糧，零用，乃至生着養·死葬·　娶，已是難得支持，再加上一個中學生全年收費用，勢非吿貸本可，而今天高利貸正在鄕村裏據從了農民的經濟，農民爲了應急　明知　入　坑面本得不限　　向下蹟去，今年有些農民爲了子弟的學費已經在　賤時出賣了。現在糧價雖在上漲，然而已經　過了，而現在百物都在漲，徒然增加也們的生活負担，如此情形，農民們從有一望子成龍的痴情，而事實上是限制他們勿作此想了。</p>
<p>這是一個値得注意的問題，往年農村裏識字者寥若晨星，形成了中國無數的文盲，現在農民們自覺自動掃除文盲，而生活的負担壓制了他們，難道我們國家就無法掃除文盲嗎？我們是農業國家，過去抗戰基礎在於農村，今後建國基礎自然也在晨村，還有什麽問題比這更重要呢？</p>
<p>在戰時，公務員就嚷着供給不起子女的學費，而今，記者巳熟視農民在爲子女的學費而預　明年的口糧，他們的子弟在今稅算是進了學校了，但是，過了今年冬天，飯都少得吃，又如何再說讀書呢？如此情形，眞令人不寒而慄！</p>

<h3>有科學乃有技術</h3>
<p>— 趙曾玨</p>
<p>著者於民國三十二年在重慶發表「從技術到科學」一文，說明民族的進步，不但須硏習技術而已，並須注重基本科學的硏究。今更闡述在原子時代基本科學的重要性，以喚起國人的注意。</p>
<p>我們研究科學的最高目的，與其說爲「應用」，不若說爲「求眞理」。科學家偉大的貢獻，最重要的還是在發一揚人類「求知」和「追求眞理」的精神。所謂科學家的生活，是「以求眞理始，亦以求眞理終」。科學家的頭腦，才是一個理智的頭腦。何以言之？科學家執行他的工作，須有六火原六大原則，然後可完成他的任務。今試言之：（一）須能辨別是非，能精密的觀察，愛好新奇但須注重證明。（二）能理解觀察所得的結果，應用嚴格的邏輯和有控制的想像，去明晰地分析，有條理地綜合；並用經騐來推求理論，更用理智來尋繹經騐。（三）須繼績不斷地將理論與實騐反覆推敲；從實騐引出假說，復從假說創造實騐以求證明，並將思想與動作合而爲一。（四）須在適當期問調整自己對於硏究科學的結論與觀念，隨時修正所創的理論，因爲科學理論由租而精，由精而微，隨時前進，應隨時修正。（五）需要硏究的自由，思想的自由，討論的自由。（六）需要多方搜集例證，要虛心參考前人或同道所得的結果，因爲科學沒有國境的限止，更無人已的限止，是人類努力求知共同的成就或收穫。以上六大原則，硏究任何科學都應嚴格的遵守，謹愼縝密的運用。</p>
<p>硏究自然科學具有兩大目標：（甲）格物致知，（乙）利用厚生。前者爲求「知」慾望的滿足，啓發宇宙的神秘。乃是人類尋求「眞理」的原動力，絕無經濟意義而超然的，已如上述。後者爲運用研究科學所得到的知識，以發揮物質的效用，乃具有經濟的意義。由於上述兩大目標的不同，其達成的任務也各異。所以近代科學家工作努力的動向又可分在三大疇範：（一）純粹科學。（二）應用科學，（三）技術。「純粹科學」完全不是爲謀物質的利益，乃從求「知」的立塲，硏究「大自然」；這是基本的科學。牠的方法，注重於客觀的觀察或試騐，從觀察或試騐的結果求理解，這種理解創爲「假說」；這種「假說」雖或爲暫時性的，但足以代表人們對於大自然現象某一時期的領悟。「應用科學」可以利用同樣的方法，得到同樣的知識，但牠追求知識的標的，乃是爲「利用厚生」。純粹科學與應用科學有若干方面完全相同，其從事硏究的人才，亦需同樣的基本訓練，但最後的目標則截然兩歧一，純粹科學所企求的是要使人類更一瞭解宇宙」，更「接近眞理」，應用科學所努力的是要「控制自然」，以達成人類對於「物質的享用」。至於「技術」，可說是實際運用純粹科學應用科學的成果或知識，而完成一種實施的經濟方法以利用「物價世界」。所以科學的研究是獲取及組織知識，技術的硏究只是運用此種知識，以達成科學以外的目的。</p>
<p>三基本科學爲技術的泉源</p>
<p>純粹科學（又稱爲基本科學）爲應用科學之本，應用科學又爲技術之本。只知發展技術與應用科學，不知注重純粹科學的基本研究，好像只盼望樹木的開花結果，不知培養樹木的根本。這樣終致花有停開，果將不結的一天！在第二次大戰中，最重要的發明有兩項：一是「雷達」，一是「原子彈」。但是假使沒有電學之聖麥士威的「電磁論」，將光學與電磁學打通，認識光波與電磁波的關係，確立電磁基本的的原理，試問「雷達」那裏能够在第二次大戰時發明？假使沒有原子大飾波耳敎授與他的同伴及學生努力研究「原子構造」的純粹科學，和其他物理學家以粒子打破原子，發現巾子，及利用中子打入原子核的基本科學工作，試問「原子彈」如何能在大戰時創造出來？所以一九四五年的諾貝爾科學獎金贈給波耳敎授，實在評判確當受之無愧。而歐洲第二戰塲的開關，不得不歸功於氣象學的進步。換言之，「雷達」與「原子彈」等的完成，至少係積聚半世紀以上人類研究基本科學所得的本錢，然後在第二次世界大戰中得到這兩份利益，而此兩份利益更幸而落在聯合國手裏，拯救了全世界人類的「自山」和「平等」。我們不能不崇拜科學的偉大，更不能不認識硏究純粹科學的重要，和科學家對於　類服務的使命與價値。假使在以後的半世紀，我們純粹科學不知努力的硏究，積蓄這種基本的學問，以備需要時的應租，則應用科學亦必停留現在的境地而不前進。應用科學如停滯不進，則我們對於製造汽車，飛機，船舶，無綫電，以及一應製造技術及工程技術，亦必毫無進步可言。常人以爲硏究制造汽車飛機等技術是重要，但不知研究基本科學更爲重要！尤其在現在的我國，純粹科學家幾不爲民衆所重視，這眞是民族莫大的危機！只有科學家及從事科學工作者的大聲疾呼，才可以喚　國民的注意與政府的捉侶及社會的擁護。否則，我國可以喚起國民的注意與政府的提侶及社會的擁護。否則。我國將不但爲原子時代的落伍者，也將永遠淪爲科學與技術落伍的國家！</p>

<h3>用國貨最光榮</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>「用國貨最光榮」是愛用國貨遝動所制定的標語，該項運動的始創者是胡伯翔先生。當時制定這一個標語，會經再三考慮，因爲旣要合於心理學的原理，又要切乎實際，絲毫沒有誇張的成分。</p>
<p>幾個月來，經過各方面的努力，「用國貨最光榮」已經成爲一般人很熟知的標語了，由於時常提起這一句標語，就可以形諸於行動，結果就可以使國貨的銷行更爲普遍</p>
<p>無論那一種運動，把握羣衆的心理，可以說是長　要的一個核心，「用國貨最光榮」，在短短幾個月來，已經開出相當美麗的花朶，我們希望在不久的將來，可以得到豐盛的果實。</p>
<h3>論紡織廠之効率</h3>
<p>— 鄧紹裘</p>
<p>本文乃摘譯自英國紡織工業研究會季刋赫德爾氏之「增進紡織工廠之効率論一，全文長的五萬字，茲將扼要譯出，以供研究及正從事於紡織工業人仕之參考。</p>
<p>（一）機械之速度</p>
<p>在紡織工業上，其紡織機械之速度高低，强弱，是與生產之數量，工作之効率，有相互聯繫性的，速度低，則產額亦低；換言之，工作効率亦薄弱。然機械之速度亦有一定之極限，太高則工作効率反爲减低，蓋紡織機械之速度，必得視織品之大，小，優，劣，紗支之粗，細，以及梭子之大，小，多孤爲定。如普通織平紋四十吋闊左右之織機，其述度以一百八十至二百（RN）爲最適宜，故欲增進工作効率的第一步，爲先將經紗之拉力彈足，而校正機械之速度。</p>
<p>（二）上漿工程</p>
<p>除了機械之速度高低外，上漿工程也是再重要不過的，其上漿工程結果良好與吾？是足以影響紡織物成品之式樣美觀，與產量以及損壞壞布廢紗之多寡，蓋上漿工程之本旨爲（一）增進紗之强方光滑，（二）增進紗之重量而求利於製織之進行也。而若欲達到上漿工程結果之良好，則不論槳紗各項工作之艱難，必得以在在留心，如漿料之配合，成份之不當，調和之方法欠妥，則對於織物不惟無益，抑且有害，且反足貽製織時無窮之困難，故欲增進工作効率第二步，爲求漿紗之成續優良，而熟悉漿料之性質相容之漿料。</p>
<p>（三）經絡工程</p>
<p>若因疏忽以致經絡工程不良，則織品必難以耐久，性必脆易換，蓋廢紗之捲入乃使紗之張力失却調和匀均，故欲增進工作効率第三步，爲對於經紗工程力問完善，否則即機械之速度適宜，上漿之工程優良，而大部份之織品，皆欲經紗工程而折損失，至此縱殫精竭力，亦徒喚奈何。</p>
<p>（四）經紗之拉力</p>
<p>經紗之品質與吾，直接關係織品之產量與品質，問接又影響出品成本，若經紗之拉力欠佳，彈性不足，則經紗於織機上，直則受綜之急張，橫亦受蔻之摩擦，而起劇烈震擊，故欲增進工作効率第四步，爲對原織品紗之　維拉力撚度均須加以精密之檢騐，如織粗布，用的十八（S）左右之經紗等等。</p>
<p>（五）其他</p>
<p>若欲詳述如何增進工塲之効率，除上述外，其他亦非本文蕳短所能論及。即著一盈厚寸餘書籍亦何足多，故欲求工作効率，其他步驟，現簡述如下。</p>
<p>（六）條幹之勻均，（七）溫度之關係，（八）經紗之乾濕，（九）工人之藝能。</p>
<p>條件之勻均與吾，與經紗拉力是有聯　性的，而溫度之關係，與經紗之乾濕亦有着相互之　係，若溫度高，則經紗乾，低則反之，而經紗乾則燥易斷，濕則製成織品後，乾燥後有收縮之弊，故紡織工塲之溫度的以七十——八十度攝氏爲最適中，且溫度過高，過低，與工人之健康亦有妨礙，最後工人之藝能當然與織品產額，工作効率關係甚大，此乃盡人皆知者也。</p>
<p>最後若經紗之拉力充足，上漿工程圓滿，盡此九事整頓，或則增進紡織王協之効率，余可祖保，穩操左券！</p>

<h3>美國產紙現狀</h3>
<p>— 費文</p>
<p>美國紙的缺乏可望於最近得到解決，這是過去數月鼓勵紙漿與紙工業發展的結果。</p>
<p>主要的生產已經增大，一切情形多對生產有利。一九四六年，前四個月的生產量爲六，二一一，〇〇〇噸，其年率爲一八，六三〇，〇〇〇噸。已超過一九四五年同時期產量百分之八，五，美國商業部國內商業局預測，國內市塲中之紙的供求關係，可能於年底時回復常態。</p>
<p>然而目前不管生產水準多高，紙與紙板仍求過於供。去年冬天西北太平洋的情形最壞。大雪阻止了紙　工塲的伐木工作。旱災與大火又接踵而至，幸虧到了五月製紙木料的生產開始增加。美國南部的製紙木料與紙漿生產佔全國百分之四十，氣候同樣對這裏的伐木者不相宜。由於大雨與大水，工作於三月間扌開始。氣候好工人亦就容易找到，四月到臨，工作亦有了好轉。</p>
<p>最大的進步是美國小學生也都知道收集廢紙了，這點對紙經濟的供獻也不小。戰時的愛國動機，已爲同等有價値的平時目標取而代之。廢紙所售的款項多用於學校的設備，戰時孤兒或幼童醫院病房等。廢紙的收集實屬驚人，四月份報館與政府機關的捐獻就有六五六，〇〇〇噸，佔那個月紙與紙板生產額的三分之一强，其總數爲一，六三五，〇〇〇噸。</p>
<p>紙產的增加，一部份可說是由於價格的上漲。最近一噸紙價便漲了六元八毛，據說還要漲百分之十呢　印刷事業則因煤與運輸工人的龍工，處境很壞，但比起一九四五年還是有增無减。四個月來美國的消費量因爲國外的輸入與國內的生產比一九四五年多二七四，〇〇〇噸或者說多百分之十七。由於有好的紙　來源，書，印刷與紙都較前精緻優良。然而五六兩月新聞紙的產量都有减無增，據七月末工業界的消息，本年下半年紙與紙板生產率將一直上升到二百萬噸，但本國的需求則超過二百萬噸。在建築中的造紙工塲，希望能於一九四七開工以完成五年的需要。看情形要到一九四八年扌能有一些出口。</p>

<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>包裝及運輸</p>
<p>生產機構問題之七</p>
<p>所以貨品的包裝，一定要求其適中，足够堅固而不過份，在設計包裝的時候，我們一定要考慮到下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）襯墊的東西：貨品裝入木箱，必須要有相當襯墊的束西，使貨品得到相當的保護，我們在包裝貨品的時候，決不能單就目前情形着想，因爲在廠專將貨品拿來拿去，都是很留心的，但一旦到了路上，就要經過無數决的震動，所以一定要想像到貨品在運輸途中的情形。</p>
<p>在國外有許多商，因爲每年出貨很多，爲了試騐包裝是否堅固起見，特地造了一種試騐器，這試騐器是相當偉大的，牠的式樣是圓形而可以轉動的，在襄而放着許多凹凸不齊的東西，然後把裝好的木箱放在裏面，於是把試騐器轉動起來，經過若干决的轉動，如果不損壞，那末就可以說是合格的了，這種方法，的確是値得採用的。</p>
<p>（二）木箱的尺寸：木箱的尺寸，一定要合於運輸方面的經濟問題。</p>
<p>（三）木箱的乾濕問題：如果木箱的木質太乾，容易裂開，如果太濕，那末又要使貨品受到損害，所以必須乾濕適中。</p>
<p>根據專家的測騐，據說木質的濕度在百分之十五，敲了釘後，立刻試騐，抵禦力有百分之一百，如果濕度是百分之三十，那末抵禦力就祗有百分之九十，如果濕度祇有百分之五，抵禦力祇有百分之五十，足見濕度最適當是百分之十五</p>
<p>（四）釘的問題：釘的長短，大小，多少，都是値得研究的問題，因爲道對於木箱的成本和堅牢，都有密切的關係。</p>
<p>如果一個製造廠所出的貨品很多，每年就需要用許多的木箱裝置，那末對於包裝問題，非要詳加硏究不可，尤其當貨品在各地都行銷的時候。</p>
<p>包裝問題解決之後，就要談到運輸的問題，中國各地都有專門辦理運輸的運輸公司，承辦運輸的手續，可以委託他們代辦，他們有規定的手續，和規定的費用，可以照着規定做去。</p>
<p>但在解決運輸問題之前，先要對於運輸的路綫，加以研究，水遝還是陸遝，取決這路綫和方式的時候，應該顧到下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）那一條路最爲妥當？（二）那一條路運費較省？（三）那一條路需時最少？有時候，往往在幾個地方，有相當銷路，那末如果把貨品分寄各地，不如先集中寄到一個地方，然後再由那地方分運出去，（在那地方設一個辦事處，如果貨品終年有銷路，或者比較起來，還是合算的）這樣在運費方面，可以較省。</p>
<p>關於運輸的事務，如果是繁劇的話，那末可以專立一部，主持關於運輸方面的事務。商務印書館在上海總廠印刷廠印成了書將以後，要發到各地分館去，因此就設立了一個分莊科專門負責主持分配和運輸方面的事務。</p>
<p>如果一個廠商的規模很大，那末竟然可以搜羅一班運輸方面的專門人扌，組織一個運鹼公司，一方面爲本廠服務，同時還可以承接外界的委託。</p>
<p>在討論運輸的時候，有一件事是不可忽略的，那就是保險的間題了。決不能在計算了一點保險費，萬一發生了意外的事情，就要蒙受很大的損失了。</p>
<h3>新型工業玻璃</h3>
<p>— 林漢</p>
<p>科學不斷的發明，工業不停的發展，跟着工業製造品也無時無刻不在進步的過程中，許多製造品也就因此而落伍，甚至失去了已有的地位。但是玻璃一物却不然，它在製造工業中的地位可能保留至千百年也將不致動搖。</p>
<p>雖然可塑體的出世，在某一方面的用途上替代了玻璃的地位，使世人祇看見假玻璃而忽視了眞玻璃，但嚴格的說，由於玻璃製造方面的改進，其用途在逐日的增長着，玻璃在將來的地位是不致受若何大的損害的。下列所述便是新近製成，用途很廣的新型玻璃：</p>
<p>在此次大戰中，有關玻璃的研究，最顯著而最大的收穫爲工業用及實騐室用的玻璃油箱的製造成功，以前認爲玻璃脆性過强，不適於作油箱之用，現在此一缺點業經克服。</p>
<p>最近發明一種新型玻璃，此種玻璃的成分不含有砂，而其主要成分爲氧化磷，它不受氫氟酸之侵蝕，此與普通玻璃究全不同，以前的氫氟酸是用鉛或臘質的容器裝遝，在實騐室中則用鉑或金的器皿裝盛以防其化學作用，現在則可以新型玻璃容器裝載，便利實多。</p>
<p>量計玻璃（Gage　glass）係一種特製玻璃，經數十年的研究而製成，它不但在戰時很有用處而且在平時對工業的進步影響也很大，因爲玻璃的量計係用來較正火車輪船及其他利用蒸汽動力以發光發熱的鍋爐的水平綫，在化學工業方面特別用在煉油工業上以指示在壓力管及貯藏箱內的液體水平面的位置。</p>
<p>玻璃絲，這種玻璃在一世耙以前已被發現，現在不過以新的形式及新的命名出現而已。以前稱爲玻璃羊毛（Glass　wool），它是一種很幼細的纖維狀玻璃，看去有點像蠶絲，單是一根此類纖維，肉眼是看不見的，因爲它比頭髮還細，普通用來代養木綿而作冷熱，電，聲，毒蟲，振動的絕緣體，及其他很廣的工業用途如：用來繞捲地下油管，煤氣管及他種金屬管子，以防銹蝕及電解作用，繞在塗有　寗或煤焦油的管子上則可耐用且遇水後會縛得更緊。總在在電綫上，可使馬達，發電機，變壓器等得到極佳的絕緣。在製造航空用（100　octane）之汽油時，玻璃絲亦用作蒸　塔內的塡充料。</p>

<h3>人生是快樂的</h3>
<p>人生的確是一個很不快樂的勾當，但是也不難使牠成爲很快樂的。要達到這個目的，並不是中一個彩票的頭獎，着了二十萬處布，或是得了白鷹獎章，或是娶到一個漂亮的老婆即能滿足，因爲這些福氣都是暫時的，而且容易使你義成一種覬覦非分的習慣。如果你要永遠地感到人生之快樂，即使在悲哀的時候也如此，則以下兩點是必需的：</p>
<p>（一）你應該永遠滿意於你的現狀，</p>
<p>（二）碰到不如意的事情，就作退一步想。</p>
<p>如果你口袋裏的火柴忽然不見了，你就得感謝蒼天不把你的口袋作爲一個火藥庫。這樣你就樂了。</p>
<p>如果你在鄉間作假期休憩的時候，來了一個不知趣的親戚，你千萬不要氣得臉色發靑，你應該很高興地說：「多麽述氣！原來並不是一個警察！」這樣你就樂了。</p>
<p>如果你的手指裏刺進了一個木刺，你該作如是想想：幸而沒有刺在眼睛裏。這樣你就樂了。</p>
<p>如果你的太太或嫂子或小姨子在鋼琴上亂彈音階，你千萬不要發脾氣。你應該心裏自以爲在欣賞音樂，而並不是在聽胡狼或貓的音樂會。這樣你就樂了</p>
<p>你應該常常作如是想：你幸而不是一匹拉車的馬，也不是一個桿狀細菌，也不是一個旋毛蟲，也不是一個猪，也不是一個被吉布賽人牽着的熊，也不是一個蝨子。這樣你就樂了。</p>
<p>你應該常常作如是想：你並不是一個站在被吿席裏的囚犯，你並不在跟你的債主打交道；你不必跟那個編輯先生屠巴商量稿費間題。這樣你就樂了。</p>
<p>如果你住在一個並不如西伯利亞那樣遠的地方，你豈不應該作如是想：祗要一個小小的機會，你也許會被充軍到那兒去的？這樣一想，你就樂了。</p>
<p>如果你有一顆牙齒痛了，你應該作如是想：幸而不是滿嘴的牙齒都痛。這樣你也就樂了。</p>
<p>你要自己安慰自己：我幸而買不起「每日公民報」看；我幸而不必駕垃圾馬車；我幸而不必同時與三個女人結婚。</p>
<p>萬一你被送進了警察局的牢房裏，你就應該快快活活地一躍入，心裏作如是想：幸而沒有被推進一個烈火熊熊的地獄。</p>
<p>如果你被人家用樺木棍打了，你應該高興得變脚亂跳，這樣喊着：「多麼運氣，原來並沒有給棘蔴鞭打着。』</p>
<p>如果你的太太對你不貞了，你就作如是想：她祗是背負了你個人而已，並沒有背負你的國家。這樣一想，你也就樂了。</p>

<h3>秋窗手記</h3>
<p>— 胡膺東</p>
<p>宿舍前面的一片曠塲上，顯得很荒凉，大堆的枯草敗葉，正被幾個野小孩子用火種燃點着，一邊燒，一邊發出畢畢拍拍的聲音，紅的火燄黑的烟身向上伸展，漸漸地化作了一圈圈的烟圈兒，掠過屋頂，消失於天際。燒野火的季節快到了，從這裏，我回想起生活在霧城的時日，每天，每天，有赤色的火光，像蛇一般地爬行在原野，山巓；如今，野火正燒遍了谷野，秋的靈魂也正在微笑；我用緘默來禮讚幻想中的野火，當我讀到詩人們用眞實的聲音與感情春的靈魂頌出生命的時候。</p>
<p>經常地，佇立在宿舍兩側的走廊上，眺望遠處的景色，那座雲山，那架夕陽洗刷下的瑰麗的海和彩色的飛瀑，以及敎堂的禿頂，落了頭髮的桐樹，這一切，蘊藏着無限的靜謐，大自然的容顧是多變的，秋，更是個成熟的季節，正像中年少婦的風姿綽約，她潛伏着時間的季節的神秘。</p>
<p>拖着沉重的脚步，沿這條黃砂舖的小道走出住宅，到外邊田野裏去走走，獵取一些秋意回來，每天吃過晚飯，我總是懷着一肚子的矛盾作如是打算的，雖然，我明知道衰老的秋的感情，決不會帶給自己一絲一縷的生氣。</p>
<p>收獲以後的田野，躺着的是帶着草根的寂寞的泥土，泥土們像是在嘆息自己的命運，它們底一年一度的耕作，所換得的祇是今日的凄凉，幾隻黑色的，不知名目的鳥，飛來，在田塲上啄食一翻，忽地又拍拍翅膀，撲撲地飛開去了。</p>
<p>一切包含着詭秘，一切是冷漠的，我獃獃地眼望着這荒凉的世界出神；秋收的大地處處暴露着一年的創痕與艱辛，數點着寂寞的心淸，我默默地走向歸途。</p>
<p>在白色的半透明的窗格子下面，讓屋子裏的燈光，映在窗子上面，屋子裏靜靜地沒有一點聲響。從走廊上走進屋子，又從屋子裏走向走廊，對面宿舍的梵亞鈴奏出了曲折的戀情，這使我更陷於紊亂。</p>
<p>黃昏，蒼白的微笑伸展在戶外。沒有月亮的夜，却偏偏有這樣的微明。</p>
<p>窗前樹影陣陣起舞，一班班地映入了乳白色的窗欞上，黑的影子在跳躍，燈的光，撩亂的心情，伴隨着這沉沉的秋夜，編織成一張淡黃色的圖畫，這時的情景使我忘不了挨過去的四個苦難的日子，更使我怕見這現實世界裏手舞足蹈的魅影…</p>
<p>人影依舊，檯燈閃耀着平和的光亮，在黃昏裏，我聽到斷續的鷄鳴。</p>

<p>「小說舊聞鈔」曾錄有關丁氏史料六則，「中國小說史料」另增「池北偶談」一則，二書未收者尙有數條；王士禎「古天于亭雜錄」卷五云：</p>
<p>「諸城丁耀亢野鶴與邱石常海石友善，而負氣不相下。一日飲鐵溝園中（東坡集鐵溝行，即其地。）論文不合，邱拔壁上劍擬丁，將甘心焉，丁即上馬逸去。丁著「天史」；詩多奇句，如老將云：低頭憐戰馬，落日大江東。」老馬云：「西風雙掠耳，落日一回頭。」此例皆警策。邱晚爲夏津訓導，過梁山泊詩云：「施羅一傳堪千古，卓老標題更可悲。今日梁山但爾，天荒地老漸無奇。」丁遷惠安令，邱遷高要令，皆不赴。」又阮葵生「茶餘客話」卷八（王氏列本，通行本見卷七）云：</p>
<p>『邱海石，丁野鶴皆山左詩人·阮亭懷人詩所謂「九仙詩人丁野鶴」，又「齊名常日邱靈鞠」是也·二君年生友善。一日同飲鐵溝園，論文不合，謾罵不已，邱拔壁上劍逐丁，丁隱出，上馬逸去，邱追不及乃返。東人傳爲佳話。」又査爲仁「蓮坡詩話」卷上（龍威秘書本）亦有一則，前半同王晫「今世說」卷六，後半又同「池北偶談」卷十二，不錄。</p>
<p>丁氏著述見於「諸城縣志」卷十三者十一種，別有「出刦紀略」一卷，見「表忠記」丁守存跋文。十一種中除「夭史」外均存；北平圖書館又藏有「家政須知」一卷，「丁野鶴先生遺稿」三卷。丁愼行「重刋西湖扇始末」又著錄「漆園草」詩集及」非非夢」，「星漢槎」傳奇二一種。</p>
<p>「續金瓶梅」見於「中國小說書目」者，有舊刋九行本及坊刋十行本二種。言言齋所藏八卷五十四回舊鈔本，疑是删略本。民國二十二年上海卿雲圖書公司排印本不分卷，六十回，刪去原書四回，文亦有節略，與其所印「古本（？）金瓶梅」同出一輙。</p>
<p>水滸後傳</p>
<p>陸心源刻「湖州　書」收有楊鳳苞「秋室集」卷一「書南山詩堂遺集後」云：</p>
<p>『明社旣屋，士之憔悴失職，高蹈而能文者，相率結爲詩社，以抒其舊國舊君之感。大江以南，無地無之。其最盛者：東越則甬上，三吳則松陵焉。…松陵爲東南舟車之都會，四方雄俊君子之走集，故尤甚於越中，而驚隱詩社，又爲吳社之冠。汾湖葉恒奏社之領袖也。…今考入社名流，見於恒奏「南山堂集」者略具：苕上則范梅隱（風仁），沈雪樵（祖孝）金完城，陳雁岩（忱）〔下列舉四十五人，略〕，跡其始干庚寅，終於甲辰。…恒奏名繼武，自號五帶山人。集凡四卷。』雖以葉氏「南山堂集」爲主，亦涉及「水滸後傳」作者陳忱。按沈彤「震澤縣志」所載即槪括此文。沈氏此條，注曰楨「南潯鎭志」三十六（志餘四）轉引之；胡適「水滸續集兩種序」，「中國小說史料」則又錄自「南潯鎭志」者。按庚寅爲淸順治七年，甲辰則爲康熙三年，此驚隱詩社始末年代之可考者（沈文無終結之年）。至所謂「其後史案株連，同社有罹法者，社遂散。」（震澤縣志）蓋指莊廷龍「明史」案中潘吳二子及蔣麟徵而言。</p>
<p>汪曰楨「南潯鎭志」所載，尙有二則未見「史料」採錄者。一見卷二十九（著述一）：</p>
<p>『陳忱（人物傳）：「雁岩雜著」（佚）。「雁岩詩集」二卷（未見。董志曰：「韓純玉詩兼序略云：睢岩與余未曾相識，歿後始見其詩及雜著等書，亟覓其全集，已散佚不能多得矣。」）』下辯二陳忱事，略。又卷三十五（志餘三）：</p>
<p>『〔南潯備志〕陳雁岩忱，前明遺老。韓純玉「近詩兼」逸集以身名俱隱稱之，生平著述並逸，唯「水滸後傳」一書，乃游戲之作，託宋遺民列行。』按「南潯備志」乃道光間沈登瀛撰，汪志著述中註「稿本存」，似無刻本。兪樾「茶香室續鈔」卷十七所節引者，疑亦擇自「南潯鎭志」也。</p>
<p>今見陳忱史料，大抵錄自韓純玉「近詩兼」居多。即陳田「明詩紀事」辛籤卷十四所錄忱詩二十四首，亦是錄自此類選本者，蓋詩集二卷至光緒間汪氏撰鎭志時已註未見，陳田「明詩紀事」輯於晚淸，更不易得見原書也。倘得「近詩兼」一檢，不難發現陳忱新史料。</p>
<p>龍舟記</p>
<p>淸毛祥齡「墨餘錄」卷四「潘九相」條，謂康熙間有潘士榮者，遊維揚，押妓九娘，妓先與三原魏韶有嫁娶約，至是遂棄魏，魏憤而斃之，鴇得賄遂不問。後士榮生子九相，即九娘轉世。魏則行應於大團鎭，與潘居近，偶與九相口角，乃被擒至潘居，毆斃之，並毁其尸。魏子控於官，置潘子及其黨於法。中有云：</p>
<p>「其黨有稍通文理者，於獄中作「龍舟記」小說，鄕里至今猶傳。』</p>
<p>按「龍舟記」一名，孫楷第「中國通俗小說書目」未載，亦未見「存疑目」（附錄一）。即輯録文獻之「小說考證」，「小說技譚」等書亦無此目。唯前人所謂小說，義頗　雜，舉凡通俗小說，彈詞，唱本，寳卷，戲曲，雜著等，無不網羅在內。民國初年刋行之「小說業考」，「小說考證」，「小說話」無不如此。此「龍舟記」究爲通俗小說抑彈詞，唱本之類，未見原書，殊難判斷，姑存疑。即爲彈詞之屬，其目亦不經見也。頗疑此與「小說考證」所徵引之「土牢記」（續編卷五引「耳郵」）「烟匣記」（續編卷一引「問居　鈔」）之類同爲流傳不廣之地方的小說或講唱之文耳。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　75</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>趕到翠姐家不遠的地方，我把車子開到路旁小樹林裏，把車子掩蔽起來。這時公路上，雖仍不見人跡，但恐發生意外麻煩，便祗在路邊高梁田裏走着。到了翠姐門口，見　店已經收了，門也關着。門上貼着一張紅紙，寫着「店主遠行，停止買賣」。</p>
<p>我方「咦」了一聲，忽然聽見裏而，有個女子聲音，嗤的一笑，接着聽見抽閂響動，門已經拉開了一部。我向室內張了一張，一團黑暗，並不見人。這時候聽見翠姐的聲音說，「快進來龍，間頭有人看見」！</p>
<p>「這是搗什麼鬼」？我在黑地裏拉着翠姐的手，一面摸索走着。</p>
<p>「這是上回同您一路來的那位小老頭的意思，他說城裏很亂，這裏怕要打仗，叫我閉幾天門再看…今天早晨，確也過了不少車子，挺重的，我們沒敢起來看。…」她叫虎弟是小老頭兒，不知什麽意思，也許因爲他「人小鬼大」？</p>
<p>渦了小院子，進了後屋，我以爲虎弟必在裏而，誰知迎出來的，只有翠姐的娘，笑嘻嘻地說些熱閙的話。</p>
<p>「剛才你不是說明小老頭兒來了嗎？…人呢」？我問翠姐。</p>
<p>「他很早來了，又出去了」。翠姐答應着，「他說您也許就來，讓我留心聽着門？一直等了這半天哪」。</p>
<p>「沒說上哪兒去」？</p>
<p>「是上車站吧」。翠姐一面說，一面側着耳聽，不止住我發强；「我聽見是敲門的聲音，讓我去看看」。不到一會兒翠姐果然同　虎弟一路進來。</p>
<p>「小姨」，虎弟在院子裏喊着。走進了屋，又游移地對我行了一個軍禮說，「隊長！報吿」。臉上却是一副尷尬樣子。</p>
<p>虎弟到底還是一個十二三歲的孩子，有些事上，他果然很有經騐；但在人事方面，倒底是個孩子。譬如這時候，他一時叫我「小姨」，那是他認爲時地上，已經同復了我們原來的關係—小姨虎弟—可是一見面，却又徬徨起來，想到他已就職，受過委任，我應該是他的上司隊長，所以他又稱我「隊長；」心下恐怕有些糊糊　塗地，好像站在公與私的邊緣上，不知應當怎樣應付才對。</p>
<p>「我們還是『小姨和虎弟』，暫時我們已經脫去了職務了」。我給了他一個清楚的界綫。當着翠姐母女，我叫虎弟把所有關於他這次的行動，却吿訴我。他據實說了，同時翠姐和他母親還補充了很多。</p>
<h3>兩封來信　—關於Mozart的譯音</h3>
<p>— 張寧</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>編輯先生：閱十七日春秋「關於樂藝上的譯音問題」一文，覺得其立論有欠正確處，擬更正其錯誤。他在文中說Mozart譯音應作「摩渣」，TT字無聲，其實錯了。Mozart的祖國文是德文，讀音約合英文　Mo'tzart之音，末尾的Ｔ音萬萬不可省賂，蓋德文之音與法文之音有所異也。豈該文作者是法國人血不識德文讀音者乎！　約瑟</p>
<p>親愛的編輯先生：昨天的「春秋」中有一篇朱理惺君的大作：關於樂藝上的譯音問題。朱君力求譯名要忠於原音，他不憚其煩地去考據，精神實在使人欽佩。可是朱君給我們的例譯，却使我看了糊塗起來。請讓我提出來向朱君請敎。</p>
<p>朱君把Mozart譯爲「摩渣」，並且認爲所有其他的譯名都是錯的。可是據我所知，（一）這兒的「Ｚ」，字應發音爲「　」，而朱君譯的「渣」字，却是「　」的聲音。（二）「t」字照朱君說是無音的，並且說是與國的讓法。可是與總語同族的　語，從來沒有這種像法語中特多的Muet，（如有字無音）。不知朱君的「奧語」是否是　國宜用的奧爾語。假如兼說是的，那來我　　，你錯了！</p>
<p>朱君又把Dvo譯成「伏夏克』，並且認爲自已譯得很「準確而得體」。他很肯定地說「Ｄ」是無音的。可是據我所知，這個「Ｄ」字是有聲音的。「Ｄ」字是有聲音的。　　上頭的oiacritic符號和『　』字上的accen符號，也不宜省去。他又說「r」應讀作「j」。其實，渡希米語中的「I」音，在英語中根本沒有相當的音，我不知朱君的「j」字是指何語中的音。</p>
<p>蹕名本來是麻煩的事，以前爲了不同的意見，曾經有過很熟烈的辯論，可是終無結果。朱君現在提出的特別是關於音樂上的名辭，並且他的所謂「音樂」是指的「西樂」，這問題應該容易解決得多，因爲欣賞愛好西洋音樂的人，照目前的事實上講來，是決不會一些西洋文字的知識都沒有的。我自己是個學習音樂的學生，碰到「摩渣」，「伏夏克」時，即知道朱君所指云何，決不會弄錯。所以我覺得朱君在自己沒有弄淸楚以前，那樣自信地說自己「準確而得體」，而斥他人却爲錯誤，實在有些多餘。——附帶吿訴朱君一聲，英文雖非拉丁文，奧語德語却亦非拉丁文也！</p>

<h3>賣屋</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>據說，中央信託局又奉令標賣第二批敵僞房屋了。第一批標賣的結果如何呢？並未看到公佈，所以也不悉其詳。</p>
<p>又據說，這幾個月其所以發行數字未增加者，主要的是靠出售敵僞物資，目前國家財政困難，道一方法未始不是上策，可惜它祇能看做救急，否則行政院長，財政部長也就很舒服，不必終日熬費躊躇，大傷腦筋了，因爲敵僞物資畢竟有限，賣賣是要賣光的。</p>
<p>中央信託局對標賣敵僞房屋這一交辦事件，的確相當頭痛，因爲賣雖賣出去，而原住者不是隨便就可以搬出的，買主不能接受到房子，自然也就不大踴躍，於是往往無人投標。不過這又非信託局所能管的了</p>
<p>當局的措施，矛盾而令人啼笑皆非的地方實在不少，以房屋來說，一方面嚷房荒嚴重，要解決公務員的居住問題，如撥巨資建築市民住宅咧；一方面却又將公務員市民們從房子裏趕出來，將這批房子準備交給市儈投機商人來剝削榨取房客，眞不知這是一種什麽高明的政策。</p>
<p>老實說，現在的敵僞房屋，大都是後方堅持八年抗戰，窮苦而拿不出金條來的公務員們所居用的，他們不是顯赫要人，可以隨便下條子撥用，但他們如果有金條（不管用什麼方式得來的）敢相　誰也不願如此，痛痛快快花　頂房子不漂亮嗎？而　，據說，凡機關佔用的暫不標賣，請問，如果沒有人辦公的機關，要這機關又何用？辦公的人如果沒有容身之處，他怎麽能來辦公？倫敦曾經發生過搶屋運動，願當局詳審熟思一下！</p>
<p>智慧測驗</p>
<h3>你健忘嗎</h3>
<p>— 藍戈</p>
<p>每個人由於他的天資的不同，他所賦有的記憶力也就往往不同。天資穎悟或感覺敏銳的人，他的記憶力比較的總要强些。反之，天資愚魯或感覺遲鈍的人，他的記憶力也就一定比較的要弱些。</p>
<p>往往，一個記記憶力薄弱的人，我們可以試騐他可笑的健忘。譬如，我今天介紹一位姓王的朋友給一位記憶力相當薄弱的人，過了一個相當的時期、當他們在偶然的機會裏重。又相逢，而姓王的招呼那位記憶力薄弱的人時，他會感到茫然地驚惶，而不知怎麽稱呼那位姓王的了。這在社交方面當然是一個非常不利的缺陷。而尤其是在學術方面，我們可以觀察，那一個科學家的記憶力是如此薄弱的。</p>
<p>同樣一件事，記憶力薄弱的人一下子就忘了。而記憶力强的人，却可以保持到相當長的時間。這裏，就顯示他們差度了。</p>
<p>記憶是每個人都有的，但是，你能知道你自己記憶的程度嗎這裏就有一個科學的方法，來測騐你目己記憶的「闊度」：</p>
<p>用三組白紙條，每組分六張’在每一組的六張白紙上寫上不同數目的數字，數字數位自五位至十位。即自最小五位數字逐漸把位數增加下去，一直到十位爲止。舉實例說，譬如第一組的六張白紙上，第一張寫68217，第二張寫953648，第三張寫4291537，第四張寫52801746，第五張寫409571392，第六張寫2147305988。其他二組，與等一組六張同，自五位至十位，不過上面所寫數字須與其他二組的不同。</p>
<p>工具完備後，就可以開始測騐了。先另外預備一張白紙與一校筆。然後把每糾數位最小的一張拿起來看，看過後藏過，一秒鐘後把所看到的每一組的張上的數字在白紙上默下來，（不許一抄寫）。這樣依次默下去，直至把三組十八張紙上的不同位數不同數字的數目都默完，最後再各自把三組所默得的數目與各該組校對一過。看每組六張中，那一位數字的數目默錯。</p>
<p>最後，那就要計算分數了。計算分數有一個一定的方式。在三組數字的最後一張十個數位的數目上，你試檢査你所默的是否完全不錯。若是三組的最後三張十個數位的數目全默對，那你的記憶闊度就是十，不論十位以上的九從八位數目是否有默錯。假使三個十位數目並不全對，那末再檢査三個九位數目是否全對，全對，那你的記憶闊度就是九。再下就依比類推。</p>
<p>若是你的記憶闊度是十，那你的記憶力是相當驚人的了。若是你的記憶闊度是五或六，那你的記憶力是太薄弱了。普通人的記憶闊度大抵在七八九之間，不到此數者，實在就是愚人。</p>
<p>你願意測騐你自己的記憶力嗎？這是一個世界一式的科學測騐，假使你高興，你不妨忠實地爲自己測騐一下，看看你的記憶闊度究竟是幾？</p>

<h3>美籍教育家　談美國教育</h3>
<p>— 飽鍾祺記</p>
<p>美名敎育家汪宗海敎授，近自美國來華，應滬江大學之聘，執敎敎育學系，十月二十一日週會時，汪氏出席發表演說，報吿近年來美國大學敎育的趨勢和動向，非常詐盡，迻譯於下以便與晚近我國之敎育作參考與比較。</p>
<p>課程制度：</p>
<p>美國自從這次大戰發生以來，訓練着重於一個能够應付社會各方面的人扌，培養一個人格高尙而有道德的優良公民。因此，美國各大學的修課學程都加以改革，美國前總統威爾遜氏曾經說過：“College　is　for　the　tral.ning　of　general　experlenceand　mental　discipline”他們的大學現在就是照着這個基本方策進行着：無論那一科的學生，對於「經濟」「政治」「宗敎」「哲學」「外國語」等科目，都是公共必修，而眞正的主修課程却反要到大三時方能讀到。說一句話也許使人懷疑，美國大學的課程比中國的要淺得多，大一扌讀解析幾何；，微積分和微分方程要到大二大三時再讀呢！</p>
<p>注重體育：</p>
<p>凡一年級學生，非會游泳不可；二年級時，一定要有第二種運動的技能，無論是足球，籃球，或騎馬，甚至於高爾夫等，目的就是使學生不能死讀書，而養成一種健全的體格。</p>
<p>課外活動：</p>
<p>美國學校往往學生祗有一千多個，但是課外活動團體却有近百個之多；學生所主辦的刊物也很多；其他每週終有演說比賽，音樂會或辯論會的舉行，使學生能够眞正得到羣育上的進益。</p>
<p>導師制度：</p>
<p>平均每個敎授負責督促八個學生的學行，担任同學日常生活的指導，學生發生無論那一種疑問，都可以向導師提出，而給你一個　意的答復。這樣可使而生間的感情激增，唯有敬之愛之而決不會有惡之畏之的成分了。</p>
<p>汪氏的演詞在同學瘋狂的鼓掌聲中結束了。凌校長接着自座中站了起來，發表了他二日前赴平參觀這個古舊的文化城中幾個最高學府的經過和感想，在靜靜的空氣中，凌校長說出了下面這一段話；</p>
<p>第一個參觀的是國立淸華大學，他們還沒有開學，雖然禮堂及圖書館等都沒有被破壞，但是偌大的一個校園，却是荒草沒脛·現在雖動工五百人修理，在十月底前恐怕未見得能够完成吧燕京是淸華貼隣，校址占地七百畝，現在已經開學，可是學生祗有八百人，生活非常困苦，每餐都是以南力人所難以下咽的「窩頭」爲主，小菜也只有鹹蘿　一盤而已。設備的破壞程度和淸華差不多，所以，燕大經費已很感困難。至於敎職員薪金，最高者只有二十五萬，最低者僅十二萬，維持淸苦的生活也頗非易易。</p>
<p>北大要算最奇怪了，不像淸華燕京那樣地有一個固定校址，各學院分散在北平各區，而以文學院爲中心；而最奇怪的莫過於學生只有二千多個，敎職員却有近一千個呢，據胡適校長說：北京學校的程度比戰前已普遍降低了三年，在這次招收新生的成績中，還是上海的水準最高。請大家想一想，上海的敎育程度倒底怎樣？美國的敎育方法是怎樣？凌校長的談話就這樣地結束了。</p>
<p>的確，凌校長在上海谷大學的校長中要算是年紀最輕的一位了，他所領導下的滬江大學已在欣欣向榮地發展着，我們也實現了導師制，我們的學校除了給我們智育上的長進外，對於德體羣育上都很注意。</p>
<p>凌校長採取中美敎育的長處，很有雄心使滬江成爲全滬大學的模範，的確是很値得稱道的！</p>
<h3>消極抵抗</h3>
<p>— 春良</p>
<p>一個文雅的老先生，把汽車駛進了一條狹路，遇見了一個靑年從對方駛來一部汽車。那裏地方偏狹，不能互相通過，祇有其中之一退出了那狹路，讓對方的一部經過了，扌能駛過去。</p>
<p>「我想，」那老先生慈愛地說：「你應該讓我路，因爲我比你老得多呢。」</p>
<p>「一寸也不讓的。」那靑年憤怒地回答着說。接着，他拿出一張報紙，坐在專中悠閒地觀看了。</p>
<p>那老先生舒服地倚在位子上，眼睛滿足地望着四圍的景緻。「朋友，」他最後呼喊着說：「你讀完了那張報紙的時候，可不可以借一借給我？」</p>
<p>那靑年終於屈服了。</p>
<h3>郵資漲</h3>
<p>— 衛兆</p>
<p>據二十三日報載；普通平信的郵資，自下月一日起，要漲爲二百元了！不禁使我想到，的確現時除去　電費和公敎人員的　　　外，是沒有再賤（便宜）的了；如果前者經過立法的通過而准予施行，這被留下的公敎人員薪給，當可自豪爲「唯我獨賤」啦！</p>
<p>漫長的戰爭，雖然是勝利了，但是爲了交通的不便，　鄕村的不靖，不知有幾多人，尙在作他鄕流浪之客！而這羣「背井離鄕」「有家難歸」的人們，用以聊解「思鄉之苦」的唯一憑藉，是一紙「家報平安」的書信了。</p>
<p>按目下的情形，二百眞不能說多，但是外省的信件，爲了運輸的關係，不得不改寄航空，若照比例　　數核　　航平或者該是五百，航快該是一千了！千八百法幣，在大腹便便的　老們，當然不算　　　可是　　自愛的公敎人員，能拿　封航空快倌錢？</p>
<p>二十　日報稱，交通當局核准改加五倍，而交立法院審議了，這　　又使仲一鄕作客的貧困遊子們，略鬆了一。氣，但願得立法當局，　　打側折　？好不讓一公敎人　　的新給，獨　孤單啊！</p>
<h3>備忘</h3>
<p>— 岡悟</p>

<h3>和平之城　聯合國首都側影</h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>據今年一月間統計，紐約市共有人口七百七十六萬八千人。這些人常中，非美國籍的佔百分之六十以上。</p>
<p>猶太人的佔紐約人口總歟的三分之一。最先來到紐約的外國人是愛爾蘭人，一八四〇年的愛爾蘭大　饉，迫使他們遠涉重洋。</p>
<p>紐約市政府的職員比整個澳洲的政府官吏還要各。紐約的警察，人數多過挪威全國的常備車。</p>
<p>平均每隔十一分鐘，紐約警察廳便要拘捕市民一名，紐約是糾紛犯案最繁的一個都市。</p>
<p>紐約全市劃爲商業，住宅，無限制，未決定四個區，各有範圍，不得逾越。</p>
<p>住宅皆有平坦寬大的屋頂，可以作日光浴，舉行宴會和拍網球。</p>
<p>紐約最高的摩天樓爲「帝國大厦」，共有一百零二層，備有電梯六十二具，電梯升降的距離近一里，簡直可以喚名「垂直鐵道」，爲了預防危險意外，梯下設有空氣井，不幸失足墮下，也不致喪命。。</p>
<p>七百數十萬市民消耗的結果，紐約每天可產垃圾四千噸，每人平均產生垃圾一磅。爲了保持市容整潔，全市僱有淸道夫達一萬五千餘人。</p>
<p>紐約的街道系統是世界上最簡單而合理的，路名多依次序以數字爲名稱。</p>
<p>第七十八號街的「奇耐亞奈格」女子公寓，建築宏偉，設備週全，房間有五六百，是全球獨一的最大女子公寓</p>
<p>在每天之中，紐約發生的事如下：出世的嬰孩有二百七卞五人；汽車殺死三十四人；結婚的有一百十六人；自殺者四人；被謀害的一人。</p>
<p>紐約的中央公園，占地八百七十九英畝。將上海所有的公園合併起來也抵不到它的一半大。</p>

<p>十五年回國，任廣州中山大學財政和經濟學敎授。他的政治生涯却從十六年開始，初任中央淸黨委員，十七年五月，隨國民革命軍北伐人山東，被派充山東省政府委員兼敎育廳長，一直聯任到今日，已經　十八年的歷史。</p>
<p>善於·應府</p>
<p>山東省的局面，自北伐以後，就形成特殊，對外對內，過去都有着極微妙的關係。省主席已經換過孫良誠，陳調元，韓復渠，沈鴻烈，牟中珩諸人，而何思源氏不但從未更職，並且由教育廳長，民政廳長，　爲省主席。抗戰期內，他始終留在山東，可見他是善於應付複雜繁難的政治環境。</p>
<p>當韓復渠主　山東時期，何氏曾以教育　長資格，視察魯西教育狀况，抵達濟甯，召　各小學教師在教育局訓話，語中有一段甚　奮妙，他說；「目前在社會中，有三種人最使人眼熱：第一種是招兵買馬，佔山爲王的山賊，名聲　亮，豐衣足食，但是老百姓沒有不　牙切齒，痛恨他們的。第二種人是有「楊貴妃」式的妹妹，嫁予所謂「官僚」，作一個玩具，兄長便可以藉了這一種玄而且妙的資格，找事尋職，輕而易舉，簡直超過學士，碩士，甚至博士，留學生。這樣的例，恐怕用兩列火車也載不完吧！第三種人是一般專在吹牛拍馬上面研究工夫，到處用手段鑽營，這樣一來，漸漸可以穫得地位升遷。你們試想，這三種人的出路都是正常的嗎？他們的人格往那裏找？祇有諸位的工作，最爲神聖和有價値，雖然淸苦，却在社會上建立不磨的功蹟……」</p>
<p>很會·說話</p>
<p>上面的一番話，何等痛快，何等輕鬆，結尾還把一頂高帽子戴在小學敎師的頭上，當然大受歡迎，這一來也可以見得這一位三國留學生的口扌，畢竟不凡了。</p>
<p>目前的山東是一個軍事衝突地區，何氏不是軍人出身，所以難以展其所長，現在旣然調任北平市長，北平是」個文化古城，人文萃　的所在，相信何氏一定可以發展他個人對於政治上的抱負的。</p>

<h3>President and Wife Arrive in Shanghai from Taiwan, Meet with Mayor Wu and Others to Inquire About Everything, Will Return to Nanjing in a Few Days After a Short Rest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] President Chiang, accompanied by his wife, went to Taiwan on the 21st of this month to inspect and comfort the Taiwanese people, and personally presided over the grand ceremony commemorating the restoration of Taiwan. He arrived in Shanghai at 2:10 PM on the 27th, flying in a special "Meiling" aircraft. The aircraft took off from Taipei at 11:15 AM on the 27th. The original plan was to land at Jiangwan Airport, but the landing was temporarily changed to Longhua Airport, so few people knew about it. Mayor Wu, along with Director Tie Wu of the Propaganda Bureau and others, waited at Jiangwan Airport to greet him, and immediately rushed to Longhua upon hearing the news. The President and his wife had already returned to their official residence on Dongping Road in car number 17745 to rest. However, more than a dozen people, including Zhang Bide, the head of the Protocol Section of the City Government, and Yan Xianghu, the Inspector of the Police Bureau, were still waiting at Longhua Airport.</p>
<p>When the President and his wife disembarked from the aircraft, they were both smiling and radiant, looking very happy. The President wore a long gown and a black jacket, with a black cloak and a gray-black felt hat. His wife wore a black coat. Shortly after the special aircraft arrived, two other aircraft carrying accompanying personnel arrived one after another. Those who came with the President and his wife included Yu Jishi, Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs; Shi Juemin, Adjutant; and more than twenty secretaries including Shen Changhuan, Zhou Hongtao, and Cao Shengfen. Chen Xizeng, Director of the General Affairs Bureau of the National Government, and others had arrived in Shanghai the day before. After arriving in Shanghai on the 27th, the "Meiling" aircraft returned to Nanjing and will fly back to Shanghai on the 28th.</p>
<p>After resting briefly at the official residence, the President met with Mayor Wu and the Director of the Propaganda Bureau at 2:30 PM to inquire about the situation in Shanghai. At 4:30 PM, he accompanied his wife and others in car number 17445 for a walk along Hongqiao Road, returning around 6:00 PM. He had dinner at the official residence in the evening, and after dinner, he went out again with his wife and others at 8:10 PM, returning to the residence after about an hour. Mayor Wu visited the President three times yesterday. It is reported that the President and his wife visited Madam Lu yesterday. The President will rest in Shanghai briefly and return to Nanjing in a few days. Another rumor says that the President may fly to his hometown of Fenghua today. All sectors of the city are currently making enthusiastic preparations to celebrate President Chiang's sixtieth birthday, and are extremely excited to hear of the President's arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 27th] President Chiang and his wife flew from Taiwan to Shanghai on the "Meiling" special aircraft at 11:15 AM on the 27th. More than a hundred people, including Chen Yi, Yang Lianggong, and Lin Yizhong, went to the airport to see them off.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] President Chiang and his wife left the temporary residence at 10:10 AM on the 27th. At 10:30 AM, they went to the Taiwan Provincial Government to preside over a press conference. At 10:55 AM, they left the government office after the conference and went to Songshan Airport. After reviewing the honor guard, they boarded the "Meiling" special aircraft at 11:10 AM amidst the melodious music. They took off at 11:15 AM, circled the city once, and then flew northwest. President Chiang and his wife arrived in Taiwan on the 21st and flew to Shanghai on the 27th, staying in Taiwan for a week. They visited Danshui, Taichung, Keelung and other places. Except for staying overnight at Sun Moon Lake on the 23rd, they stayed at the Caoshan temporary residence in Taipei for a total of five days. Caoshan is located in the deep valley of Samsung Mountain and Yarn Hat Mountain in the northern suburbs of Taipei, 11 kilometers from the city, 443 meters above sea level. The spring water contains sulfur and can be reached by car from the city in 40 minutes. On the morning of the 27th, the President and his wife left the mountain, and the nearby children held flags and gathered along the road to bid farewell.</p>
<h3>President Commends Rapid Restoration of Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 27th] At 10:00 AM on the 27th, before President Chiang departed from Taiwan, he received reporters at the Taipei Governor's Office. More than a dozen people, including Ye Mingxun from the Central News Agency and Li Wanju from the New Life Daily, were present. President Chiang answered the reporters' questions about his impressions of inspecting Taiwan as follows:</p>
<p>I am very pleased to see that the restoration work in Taiwan has been 80% completed. In particular, the transportation and water and electricity industries can be said to have been restored to the standards of the Japanese era before the war. Therefore, general economic activities can be quickly restored, and people can live and work in peace. Comparing the transportation, economy, and people's living conditions in Taiwan with those in the mainland, especially in Northeast and North China, the degree of prosperity is incomparable.</p>
<p>When we review the achievements of Taiwan's restoration work today, we are grateful to our ally, the United States, for assisting our country in handling the repatriation of 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war immediately after the war. This allowed the Japanese prisoners of war in Taiwan to be repatriated within a short period of time, enabling the rapid restoration of social order. This kind of assistance, which is purely out of pure friendship, is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Education in Taiwan has become widespread, and the social foundation is quite sound. In the future, on the one hand, we should strengthen the people's national consciousness and national concept, and on the other hand, we should improve the people's cultural and living standards. In the past, although education in Taiwan was widespread during the Japanese colonial era, the Japanese never allowed Taiwanese people to make progress and conduct research on various advanced subjects. The various political and economic measures implemented in Taiwan were all to govern Taiwan as a colony. In the future, the policy of the Taiwan Provincial Government should first focus on public opinion and cultivate public spirit. In education, we must pay attention to the spirit of mutual assistance and autonomy, so that academic thought can develop freely. In particular, we must promote the inherent virtues of the nation, so that every Taiwanese compatriot knows the importance of unity and cooperation, and enables them to have the ability to respect themselves and be independent, so as to become the backbone of national construction. I hope that you, in the position of public opinion, will assist the government in leading the people to work hard on construction, and in three to five years, Taiwan will surely become a model province.</p>
<p>Last year, foreigners observed Taiwan and believed that after such a major bombing and the degree of damage, our government would be unable to restore the original state of the Japanese era. Some even publicly criticized that after our government took over Taiwan for six months, transportation, water, and electricity industries would be interrupted and unable to maintain. However, today's facts prove that during the restoration period of this year, we have restored important works such as transportation and water conservancy without the help of foreigners, and various undertakings have not only not been interrupted, but have also made progress day by day, which shows that the Chinese people have the ability to construct. This fact is truly worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>I am in a hurry to leave today, so I cannot discuss it further. I hope you will convey to all the compatriots in Taiwan to work together to build a new Taiwan of the Three Principles of the People. My wife and I have been welcomed during our stay in Taiwan for several days, and I hope you will convey our thanks.</p>

<h3>New Proposals from Third Parties Still Being Considered in Draft Form</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The new proposals from the third parties in the ongoing peace talks were initially completed on the evening of the 26th, and an emergency meeting was held at Jiaotong Bank on the morning of the 27th to discuss them. At 3:00 PM, Zuo Shunsheng, Qian Xin, and Zhang Junmai visited Zhou Enlai to inform him of these preliminary opinions and explain them. They left at 5:00 PM. Subsequently, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junmai, Mo Dehui, and Zuo Shunsheng went to Sun Ke's residence. Government representatives Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, and Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference Lei Zhen were also invited to attend the meeting. First, Huang and others read out the draft new proposals item by item, explained them in detail, and expressed that they would revise the proposals. After the final completion, they would ask the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for instructions separately before making a decision. It is reported that the content of the proposals includes three major items with several attached clauses, which are formulated by integrating the opinions of both parties. According to Sun Ke, the content of the proposals is very close to the government's opinion. In addition, due to the loss of Andong, the Communist Party decided to express to the third parties that they "do not want to talk anymore," so ten people once made pessimistic remarks. When the third parties visited the government representatives on the 27th, they conveyed this matter. However, the government stated that it would continue to meet with the third parties and accept their mediation. At 8:00 PM, the third parties continued to hold a meeting at Jiaotong Bank to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Issues Statement: Six Key Points of Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke met with reporters today and issued the first formal report on the current informal peace talks, revealing six key points related to the Kuomintang-Communist conflict. Formal negotiations can only begin after these six key points are resolved. The six key points are as follows: (1) The issue of the Communist army's garrison area in Northeast China: Sun said that the Northeast China Truce Agreement, which was established in June of this year, designated half of the two Northeast provinces as the Communist army's garrison area. However, at that time, due to the unresolved dispute over the Andong issue, the agreement was not signed. But now, according to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), there is no established agreement on designating half of the two Northeast provinces as the Communist army's garrison area. The provisions in the Northeast China Truce Agreement only concern the clauses on Harbin. (2) The issue of local government: Whether it should be resolved in informal talks or left to the reorganized National Government Committee to resolve. (3) The issue of submitting the draft constitution to the National Assembly: Sun said that the government, in view of the fact that the Constitutional Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) failed to formulate a PCC draft constitution that could be accepted by all parties, advocated treating the May 5th Draft Constitution as the formal draft. (4) The CCP refuses to participate in the National Assembly before the government is reorganized. (5) The issue of whether the reorganization of the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan should be carried out simultaneously: Sun said that according to the PCC resolution, the National Government Committee should be reorganized first, and then the Executive Yuan should be reorganized. Sun likened the National Government Committee to a mother and the Executive Yuan to a son, saying: "There must be a mother before there can be a son." (6) The issue of the number of seats that parties other than the Kuomintang should occupy in the Executive Yuan: Sun Ke revealed during the meeting with reporters that Luo Longji, the leader of the Democratic League, requested that the Communist Party and third parties should get seven to eight seats. At the same time, the content of the propaganda truce plan established last Friday was not announced on the scheduled date. Luo said that the agreement is still awaiting approval from Yan'an. According to the Central Daily News, the agreement includes the following three clauses: (1) The Kuomintang and the Communist Party should immediately stop the stimulating propaganda war. (2) News about the peace talks should be released by the third parties. (3) During the truce, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should issue war communiques. Regarding the second item, the CCP delegation is asking Yan'an for instructions.</p>
<h3>The CCP's Opinion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The CCP spokesperson refuted Sun Ke's remarks to reporters in the Nanjing Central Daily News on the 27th, and at the same time claimed that this was the CCP's first positive explanation of the government's eight articles, which briefly stated that Sun said that the first and second articles were not a problem. The Communist Party stated that in the June truce negotiations, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party agreed on a draft agreement of four items in whole or in part. Now the government only selected two of them. Regarding the other three articles, Sun said that "although an agreement was reached, it was not signed." The Communist Party believed that in the June negotiations, the government requested the Communist army to retreat to two and a half provinces, which the Communist Party fundamentally did not agree to, so there was no agreement to speak of. As for the so-called temporary stationing of the National Army in Central and North China in the current location, and the issue of local government, it was limited to within the Pass (Guannei). The Communist Party believed that the government had clearly pointed out that the Northeast was excluded. Finally, it stated that the government has always insisted on the eight demands that the Communist Party cannot agree to, and took the opportunity to occupy Andong during the negotiation process, continuing the nationwide civil war, which fully proves that the government has no sincerity. A certain government representative said that he did not know where the Communist Party's sincerity was.</p>
<h3>The CCP Admits Withdrawal from Andong</h3>
<p>Expresses that it has an Impact on Peace Talks</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation, Mei Yi, officially announced on the evening of the 27th that the Communist army had withdrawn from Andong on the afternoon of the 24th, and at the same time expressed that this had a considerable impact on the negotiations. The government representatives said that such incidents often occur because the war has not stopped. If the Communist Party can agree to the government's opinions earlier, then there would be no such thing today. At the same time, the Andong war was caused by the National Army taking self-defense counterattacks in the Andong area.</p>

<h3>National Army Controls Coastline from South of Andong to Zhuanghe, Soviet Army on Dajiang Bridge, We Request Its Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The National Army is making a comprehensive advance from south of Andong to Zhuanghe. The coastline such as Dagushan, Qingduizi, and Zhuanghe have all been taken over by the National Army on the 26th. The National Army in Zhuanghe is cleaning up the areas from the southwest to the so-called Guandongzhou border line by the Japanese. Several Soviet troops are stationed at the Dajiang Bridge leading to Korea in Andong, and we have negotiated to request their withdrawal. There should be no problems with the power generation from the hydroelectric power plant on the other side of the river, because both China and the Soviet Union need it. The war in Andong City was rapid. The fighting was only slightly fierce in places such as Motianling and Dagushan near Fengcheng. There was no contact in places such as Xiuyan. According to the troops entering Xiuyan, they advanced to more than 20 miles away from Xiuyan. Because the telephone had not been destroyed by the Communist army, they used the telephone to talk to the county head appointed by the Communist army in Xiuyan and asked him how it was going. The county head replied urgently that there were only more than 200 troops left in the city and he could not defend it. The National Army told him that we would defend it for you, and the National Army then entered the city. In addition, there are still more than 10,000 Communist troops in Andong, preparing to retreat into the mountains for guerrilla warfare. The National Army is carrying out the work of clearing them out. According to military authorities, in order to relieve the siege of Zhangyuan, the Communist army mobilized its forces to launch offensives in Xi'an and other places. As a result, the National Army was stationed in Zhangyuan, and the Communist army in Xi'an did not succeed, and lost Andong as a result. This is what is called intending to take advantage of the National Army's emptiness, but being taken advantage of by the National Army instead.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] The National Army in the southern section of the Chinese Changchun Railway received Xiongyue City on the 26th and is now advancing south along the route. It is reported that it can reach Fuxian within days.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 27th] Neutral observers here announced today that the government army authorities are now worried that the National Army's recovery of Andong may cause international disputes. These observers returned to Beiping from Shenyang last night. According to them, Andong is located near the Soviet-occupied area in northern Korea, and the National Army authorities are paying close attention to the Soviet Union's reaction. However, it is known that the Soviet army is stationed on the other side of the Yalu River and has no contact with the Chinese Communist army on this side of the Yalu River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] After the National Army was stationed in Shenyang and on the Andong Line, the Northeast Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Transportation has sent personnel to inspect. It is reported that there are many caves along the line, which have all been destroyed by the Communist army. According to the railway bureau, the line needs 350,000 railway ties. In addition, the Shenhai Line still needs 150,000 railway ties, which is quite difficult to raise. The unused railways in the line and the Fushun and Anshan mines are now being dismantled to supplement them.

<h3>The National Government Reiterates the Prohibition of Opium, Ordering Military and Political Organs to Strictly Supervise and Thoroughly Eliminate Opium Within the Time Limit</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The National Government orders: It has been previously stipulated that opium and drugs nationwide must be thoroughly eliminated within three years after the end of the war, without any extension. Cultivation, transportation, sale, and smoking are all subject to penalties, which cannot be reduced lightly. However, to prevent the source of opium, strict prohibition of cultivation is essential. Given the vast territory of our country, investigations may not be comprehensive. In remote areas, ignorant people only seek profit, making it difficult to guarantee that they will not disregard the prohibition and secretly cultivate opium seedlings. Now is the time for sowing poppies in late autumn and early winter. If precautions are neglected, old habits are easily repeated, which will inevitably affect the future of the prohibition policy and cause significant harm. Therefore, we reiterate the order, earnestly admonishing and warning that all military and political organs nationwide must strictly supervise and thoroughly prohibit opium cultivation. Local governments at all levels must conduct comprehensive inspections within their jurisdictions. Adjacent areas of provinces, counties, and cities should be jointly responsible and work together to prevent opium cultivation. Any opium seedlings discovered must be immediately eradicated, and those who planted them must be punished according to the law. Those who rely on power and influence to protect opium cultivation or resist eradication will be severely punished to serve as a warning. It must be understood that effective prohibition of opium is the goal, and prohibiting cultivation is the primary task of eradicating drugs. The deadline is approaching, and negligence cannot be tolerated. We hope that all will strictly abide by the laws and regulations and diligently implement them to achieve early prohibition and complete success, which is our great expectation.</p>

<h3>Ministry of National Defense Cables Military and Political Organs to Provide Guidance to the Families of Deceased Soldiers and Officers in Applying for Pensions; Excerpt of Chairman's Handwritten Instructions, Hoping for Strict Compliance</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of National Defense, because the Pension Committee has ended, all pension cases will continue to be handled by the Pension Office of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, specially excerpted Chairman's handwritten instructions, telegraphed to each line of command, commander's office, pacification public office, municipal government, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Social Affairs, and each general headquarters, and various offices, bureaus, and departments, urging their subordinates to guide the families of the deceased in applying for pensions, so that the families can universally benefit from the actual benefits, and to live up to the Chairman's utmost concern. The original telegram stated briefly: It has been found that there are many officers and soldiers who sacrificed their lives during the eight years of the war of resistance. Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about the families of the soldiers. I hereby respectfully excerpt Chairman's handwritten instructions to Yu on July 7, 26th: (1) Commanders of each unit must report the facts of the deceased soldiers under their command at any time, as well as the situation of their ancestral homes and relatives, and quickly apply for pensions, without backlog. If the situation of their relatives is unclear, they should write to the government of their original hometown to investigate and report in detail. Do not intentionally delay due to their lack, so as not to miss them; (2) If the family members are sure that their children have died in battle, but have not yet received the pension certificate, they are allowed to report for pension; (3) If the family members do not understand writing very well, or do not know the procedures for applying for pensions and receiving documents, the local Baojia chiefs or gentry, or educational personnel, if they know, should immediately assist them in handling the matter, or in accordance with the method of giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers on expeditions, the enthusiastic and capable people in each place should specially find ways to maintain their livelihoods, and should be regarded as a supplement to the matters in the committee chairman's secret telegram to the gentry and educators nationwide on January 19, and earnestly promote it. If local governments and Baojia personnel deliberately embezzle the pension funds that each family should receive, once verified, no matter how much the amount is, they will be severely punished; (4) All civil and military personnel dispatched by the central party and government agencies to inspect and review the front and rear should immediately visit and investigate the families of the deceased soldiers in various places, whether the pension funds they should receive have been received in accordance with the regulations, and whether the local government and people can earnestly abide by the preferential treatment laws and regulations, and report the implementation in detail to the committee chairman for verification. The original dispatching agencies of the central government should also list it as one of the assessments of the diligence and merit of the dispatched personnel. The above points, although brief and essential, are effective ways to implement the pension regulations, and are also the unshirkable responsibility of Zhongzheng and military and political leaders at all levels and compatriots across the country. We hope that all will comply. etc. Now that the Pension Committee has ended, all pension cases will be continued by the Pension Office of the Joint Logistics Headquarters of the Ministry. We hope to urge our subordinates to guide the families of the deceased in applying for pensions, so that the families can universally benefit from the actual benefits, and to live up to the Chairman's utmost concern. In addition to sending telegrams, we also send telegrams to check and handle, and also forward the order to comply.</p>

The members have worked tirelessly under difficult and arduous circumstances, which is very gratifying." He also stated. "There are only 200 people engaged in geological work in our country, and currently, only middle people can be added each year, and only 200 people can be added in ten years, which is far from the goal of increasing 1,200 people in ten years as expected. We hope that geological education and the geological community can cooperate; the personnel changes in the geological community during the war were extremely large, which affected the work. Now that the situation has stabilized, we hope that all members can stand firm in their positions and continue to work."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Looking at These Fourteen Days of News</h3>
<p>After the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representatives Zhou Enlai and others and the third-party representatives went to Nanjing a week ago to resume the long-stalled peace talks, everyone believed that this was a major turning point in the current domestic situation. We, the common people, could not help but ignite a glimmer of hope, hoping that the political situation would become clear from now on. Before flying to Taiwan, Chairman Chiang met with the CCP representatives and the third-party representatives who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai and sincerely stated: "From now on, the talks will be presided over by President Sun, and we hope that they will start quickly and be completed quickly." However, time flies, and in the blink of an eye, another week has passed, and the peace talks are still stuck in the dispute between the "eight points" and the "two articles." Although the third party has made great efforts to refer to the government's "eight points" and the CCP's "two articles" to draft a compromise plan, it has not yet been submitted, and we do not know what the content is. However, from today until the National Assembly opens as scheduled, there are only two weeks left. The progress of the peace talks seems to be as slow as a snail's pace. How can we, the ordinary people who yearn for peace and democracy, not be extremely anxious?</p>
<p>The people of the whole country read the newspapers every day, hoping to see good news, but what they see is still that the CCP refuses to accept the concrete methods for resolving the Kuomintang-Communist issue proposed by Chairman Chiang as the basis for negotiations and insists on taking the two preconditions of the Yan'an statement as the premise. Therefore, the peace talks are stranded. On the one hand, the third-party representatives are drafting a compromise plan, and on the other hand, they are asking President Sun to telegram Chairman Chiang to return to Nanjing so that the government can make a final decision at any time. At the same time, all parties also believe that if this peace talk is to be successful, a friendly political atmosphere must be cultivated. Therefore, the method of publicizing a truce was discussed. The third party put forward three points: (1) Both sides stop propaganda warfare; (2) Subsequent news of the peace talks will be released by the third party; (3) Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can also release war reports. The government has expressed its agreement in principle, but the CCP representatives still need to ask Yan'an for instructions on the second method. The result of a week of peace talks is, at best, only this. Looking forward to Nanjing is really unbearable!</p>
<p>Standing on the position of the people, this newspaper has repeatedly stated that it hopes that the country can be peacefully unified and democratic, not only expecting the country to turn hostility into friendship as soon as possible, but also hoping that politics can immediately embark on the right track of constitutionalism, with a democratic and peaceful constitution, so that no political party will use weapons as a tool for political struggle, and from then on, all parties can use the parliament as the battlefield and lips and tongues instead of guns and cannons; therefore, we sincerely hope that the repeatedly postponed National Assembly will not be postponed again. Chairman Chiang formally stated yesterday morning in Taipei when hosting the press: "The National Assembly will be convened as scheduled, and the government will never change this determination due to any external obstruction, so there is no possibility of postponing the National Assembly." We were very pleased to hear this. It seems that there are only two weeks left from today until the day the National Assembly opens. Can the peace talks still be so slow? Fourteen days of work will pass in the blink of an eye, can we still delay? Therefore, we hope that the third party will make special efforts in these fourteen days to mediate and bring the opinions of both sides closer; we also hope that the CCP can take the overall situation into account and not create complications, and lose this last opportunity; at the same time, we also hope that the government can take a broad view and not argue over minor details. We must complete the task of peace talks within these fourteen days, so that we, the common people, can see the representatives of various parties gathering under Zijin Mountain on the day of Sun Yat-sen's birth to jointly discuss the fundamental law of the country and lay a solid foundation for the country's century-long plan.</p>
<p>In short, from today until the day the National Assembly opens on Sun Yat-sen's birthday, there are only fourteen days left. The people of the whole country are looking forward to Nanjing every day, and are waiting for good news every moment; we hope that all parties will not disappoint the people's urgent expectations too much.</p>
<h3>The Issue of the United Nations Veto</h3>
<p>The Second General Assembly of the United Nations is currently being held in New York, and recent discussions seem to be focused on the so-called revision of the veto power. British Prime Minister Attlee, during a previous debate on foreign affairs in the British Parliament, expressed the British government's attitude towards the veto, believing that the veto power of the United Nations has been arbitrarily abused by a certain powerful nation. He issued a warning, stating: "Such phenomena will gradually diminish the value of the Security Council." The leader of the opposition in Britain, former Prime Minister Churchill, echoed this sentiment, forming a unified British front against the veto power. Recently, Cuba, Australia, the Philippines, and other countries have also submitted requests to the United Nations General Assembly, asking for the organization of a special committee to discuss the abolition and amendment of the veto power. The presentation of this request was immediately opposed by the Soviet Union. Soviet commentary even considers any country opposing the veto power to be an enemy of peace; this shows how firm and vehement the Soviet Union's attitude is. In Britain and the United States, it is believed that since this issue has been raised, it should be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. This position is incompatible with the Soviet Union's attitude. Therefore, the discussion and handling of the veto power issue will be a difficult problem for the Second United Nations General Assembly. How this issue will develop in the future is related to the maintenance of world peace, and it is indeed worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The so-called veto power was originally a system stipulated in the United States Constitution. Its purpose is to enable the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the government to have mutual constraints and checks and balances. The establishment of the United States Constitution came after the French Revolution; at that time, political thought was deeply influenced by Rousseau and Montesquieu; and Montesquieu praised the separation of powers system. Based on this doctrine of separation of powers and checks and balances, the United States Constitution thus stipulated the political system of the United States. This means that laws passed by Congress can be vetoed by the president; however, when this law is passed again by Congress, the executive veto loses its effect, and only a judicial veto can invalidate the law. The origin of this system bears a strong 18th-century flavor. Some public law scholars in the United States also believe that this system is outdated and advocate for its amendment. However, in the United States, there is also a provision to veto the veto, so it does not lead to major problems for the country's governance.</p>
<p>The provision for veto power in the United Nations organization can be said to be entirely a concession to the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet Union felt that it had few allies in a world organization, it was difficult to manipulate the voting of the United Nations. Therefore, when planning the organization of the United Nations, it indicated that the establishment of the veto power was a necessary condition for the Soviet Union to participate in the United Nations. Under the circumstances at the time, if there had been no veto provision, the United Nations organization would have faced an insurmountable fate. British and American politicians were not unaware that if there were such provisions, the United Nations organization itself would have major deficiencies from the start, which would cause great difficulties in the future operation of the United Nations organization. However, here, as elsewhere, President Roosevelt believed that sincerity could move people. He believed that with his intelligence, he could win the support of the Soviet Union, so he did not give in on "minor details." However, realpolitik and President Roosevelt's noble ideals may not always coincide; and President Roosevelt did not live to see world peace and the future operation of the United Nations organization and passed away.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the provision for veto power makes the United Nations organization exist in name only and is a very unreasonable system. The inability of small and medium-sized countries to enjoy this privilege already violates the principle of national equality; at the same time, the unrestricted use of the veto power in the Security Council creates a situation where the minority oppresses the majority. As long as one country opposes it, the Security Council cannot make any resolutions or take any actions. The unreasonableness of this is conceivable. The use of the veto power in the past year has inevitably been a fatal obstacle to the United Nations organization, making it impossible to advance its work. Therefore, from the perspective of the effectiveness of the United Nations organization itself, this provision for veto power is tantamount to paralysis. If surgery is not performed, it will be difficult to restore health. In order to improve the organization of the United Nations organization itself, it would naturally be best if this provision for veto power could be abolished. However, under the current circumstances, the abolition of the veto power still seems to be an unattainable goal. For the sake of the effectiveness of the United Nations General Assembly organization, it seems that we cannot allow the unrestricted use of the veto power, and its operation must be subject to certain restrictions, which may reduce the public's condemnation of the veto power.</p>
<p>But whether the veto power is retained or restricted, these are all external forms. If countries can have mutual trust and faith, then the existence of the veto power will never become a problem; the reason why it becomes a problem is because of the lack of international trust and faith. As the United Nations General Assembly discusses the veto power, we must urge all countries to first establish mutual trust between each other, and then all problems can be solved easily, and the veto power will no longer become a problem.</p>

<h3>No Changes to Conscription in Southern Jiangsu; Suspension Only Applies to Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 27th] A Shanghai newspaper published on the 26th a conversation with the Director of the Conscription Bureau, Xu Siping, stating that conscription in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas would be temporarily suspended due to insufficient preparations. The news has drawn close attention from people in this county and the surrounding counties of Wuxi, Wujin, and Wuxian, causing quite a stir. This newspaper's special correspondent in Suzhou, seeking verification, visited the commander of the garrison area in Suzhou, Du Xu, on the 26th, but was unable to meet him due to official business. On the morning of the 27th, he visited again and was granted an audience. Commander Du said: The areas for which Director Xu spoke about delaying conscription are limited to Nanjing and Shanghai. It is regrettable that the Shanghai newspaper mistakenly added the phrase "and surrounding areas," causing confusion and doubts, and he hoped for a correction. Currently, among the three counties under the jurisdiction of this area—Suzhou, Wujiang, and Wuxian—Wuxian has the best conscription performance. The quota for that county is 800, and half have been recruited by the previous day. Suzhou's quota is 980, and although they have been continuously sending recruits to the county for inspection and acceptance, the urban area has not been mobilized, so only about 200 have been collected. Wujiang's quota is 450, but no recruitment report has been received at all. He has decided to personally go to that county on the 28th to supervise. In short, the deadline for conscription is the end of this month, and each county must recruit according to the deadline. The reporter then asked how the training work for the newly recruited soldiers would be carried out. Commander Du replied: For the time being, the three counties will conduct preliminary induction education locally and physical education. Suzhou will form six companies, Changshu will form two companies, and Wujiang will form two companies. The garrison area headquarters will assign personnel to each county to supervise the training. Once the induction education is completed, they may choose a location to concentrate on implementing formal infantry training. Commander Du added: Military service is the duty of every citizen, so we must not fill the ranks with unqualified personnel. We must ensure that all recruits are formal county residents and eligible young men. He hoped that the county magistrates would pay close attention to this matter.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 27th] The Wuxi County Government, the district offices, and the township offices have been actively promoting conscription in recent days. However, because it is difficult to recruit volunteers, it has been decided to draw lots on the 29th, selecting one candidate from each bao. Qian Sunqing, chairman of the county chamber of commerce, after seeing a report a few days ago that a senior military service official told reporters that the Conscription Law is only a basic law and that more than 20 other laws related to military service have not yet been finalized and promulgated, believes that the proper handling of military service may have to wait. Therefore, based on the above-mentioned conversation, he sent a letter to the district chief of the urban area, Shen, today, calling his attention to the matter and informing the county government for reference.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Songjiang Dispatch] Conscription in this county was carried out on the 26th by the district offices drawing lots in each township. Three people were selected from each township. Among them, Yue Temple, Piyun, Kuatang, and Huayang towns, as well as Lita Hui, Baiwo, Longxing, and Xiaoxijing townships, each had three volunteers, so they were exempt from drawing conscripts for military service. The draftees selected from the other townships have been issued conscription orders, which have been handed over to the township chiefs to transfer to the draftees, who are to report on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Ningbo Dispatch] This county has been ordered to implement temporary conscription, with a quota of 1,055 people. We began handling applications for exemption from military service on the 5th of this month. The original deadline was the 20th. The county assembly, at a temporary meeting, decided that the application procedures were complicated and it was difficult to complete them by the deadline. Therefore, they telegraphed a request for an extension of 15 days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pinghu Dispatch] With the draft looming in this county, the county government, to urge each township to handle the matter seriously, has established six supervisory groups, each with a leader and a member. They have been dispatched to supervise each township and district starting on the 25th and will complete their work by the 16th of next month.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders Counties to Strengthen Security on Transportation Lines; Suzhou Townships Strictly Prevent the Resurgence of Scattered Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 27th] In order to ensure rural security after the suppression of bandits and to prevent the resurgence of scattered bandits, the Suzhou County Government has formulated specific measures and ordered the organization of joint township offices in townships with unstable security and important strongholds. The participating units are not limited, but are mainly those whose transportation geography is interconnected. The only principle is to concentrate local self-defense forces and coordinate them in a unified manner at any time to ensure complete safety. At the same time, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has also telegraphed each county, ordering them to earnestly improve the organization of road protection villages along the transportation lines. On the one hand, this is to prevent scattered bandits from fleeing, and on the other hand, it is to ensure the safety of the transportation lines. The order also specifically warns that if any changes are caused by negligence, the heads of each jurisdiction will be held accountable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Zhenjiang Long-Distance Telephone Lines to Be Increased; Zhenjiang Telegraph Office to Establish a Command Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Zhenjiang Telegraph Office has been ordered to establish a Command Bureau. The bureaus and offices under its jurisdiction are Danyang, Jurong, Longtan, Taizhou, Taixing, Yangzhou, Xiannvmiao, Gaoyou, Shaobo, Baoying, and Lianghuai, which will adopt direct command methods for communication guidance, without separate written documents. According to Director Ni, the main reason for establishing the Command Bureau is to save time and operate smoothly. He then spoke to reporters about the current telegraph and telephone business. Before the war, the bureau had 1,200 telephone sets in the provincial capital. After the restoration, due to limited equipment and restrictions from the ministry, there are only 700 sets currently. The existing palace-style internal exchange, with a capacity of 1,500 lines, can only use 800 lines, and there are about 700 local telephone lines. According to Qian Jie, the person in charge of the bureau's telephone business, 400 lines of the exchange were damaged by the enemy and have not yet been repaired due to a lack of parts. Regarding long-distance telephones, there is only one line between Shanghai and Zhenjiang, and callers have to wait two or three hours or more, leading to complaints from users. It has been proposed to the ministry to add three more lines, which will be realized soon. However, there are already three lines between Nanjing and Zhenjiang, which is faster. As for telegrams, improvements are being made step by step. Before the war, the total number of telegrams received each month was over 7 million. After the bureau's restoration, 30,000 telegrams per month was still insufficient. Currently, it can handle over 50,000 telegrams per month. Gaobao, Huai'an, and Taizhou have all restored telephone and telegraph services, and the number will gradually increase as needed in various counties in northern Jiangsu.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province to Conduct Social Survey; Divided into 26 Categories, to Be Conducted Within the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou Dispatch] Social surveys are an important basis for administrative facilities. To understand the general situation of society after the war, the Zhejiang Provincial Government decided to conduct a social survey of all counties in the province. Chairman Shen is also very concerned about this work and ordered the Department of Social Affairs to proceed quickly within this year. The Department of Social Affairs drafted a plan and outline for conducting a social survey of each county and city in Zhejiang Province. The Department of Social Affairs invited dozens of responsible persons from relevant agencies to hold a review meeting in the provincial government conference room, and the original plan was discussed and revised in detail, especially adding a lot to the outline section. Regarding the principles of the plan's tips and implementation methods, the goal is to strive for the greatest effect at the smallest cost.

<h3>Taking Advantage of the Opportunity to Cause Trouble with the Intention of Blackmail: Over 800 Prisoners on Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 27th] About 800 prisoners at the Siqian Street Detention Center of the Suzhou High Court have engaged in a group hunger and water strike from the morning of the 26th to the afternoon of the 27th. This newspaper's special correspondent in Suzhou inquired about the inside story from various sources and learned the details as follows: It turned out that a prisoner charged with treason, Zhou Zhongshan, from Anhui Province, had been detained for more than half a year. His wife, who worked as a helper in Nanjing, came to Suzhou for the first time to visit her husband on the morning of the 26th. Cheng Weiying, the director of the detention center, said that the visitation period was stipulated as every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which was difficult to make an exception. He did not grant the request, but only allowed the items brought by her to be passed into the prison by the guard. Unexpectedly, when Zhou learned that his wife had come to Suzhou to visit him, he was overjoyed and demanded to be allowed a face-to-face meeting. When this was not granted, he roared in the prison. Director Cheng, seeing that Zhou was disrupting order, interrogated him and warned him, and put him in shackles and confined him to a solitary cell as a punishment. When the incident was heard by all the prisoners, they felt that Zhou had been separated from his family for more than half a year, and they had traveled thousands of miles to visit him. Even if the request to meet violated the regulations, it was unavoidable due to human feelings. Now, not only was it not allowed, but he was also being punished. This aroused public outrage, and they unanimously began a hunger and water strike. From the morning of the 26th to the afternoon of the 27th, for a full day and night, more than 800 prisoners did not drink a drop of water. After Sun Honglin, the president of the High Court, found out, he immediately went to the detention center to persuade the prisoners with sincere words and ordered Zhou to be unshackled and returned to his cell. All the prisoners were deeply moved and began to resume eating and drinking on the afternoon of the 27th, and this disturbance finally subsided. After the incident, the reporter visited Sun and talked about his views on the incident. He said that prison management is originally a very difficult task, but at a time when social security is not yet stable, in fact, we have to take strict measures to prevent hidden dangers. The prisoners have been caught in the legal net and do not know how to be discreet, taking advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble with the intention of blackmail. This trend must not be allowed to grow. He has now strictly ordered Director Cheng to pay attention to the prisoners' usual education work in order to naturally reform them.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou City Land Value Tax: Agreed Upon Three Principles</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Dispatch] The Hangzhou City government and the City Council have repeatedly argued over the standards for levying the Hangzhou City land value tax. The county-level proposal has been pending for a long time. The City Government, believing that the collection of land tax is imminent, submitted a request to the City Council's extraordinary general meeting for reconsideration on the 25th. Following previous negotiations, it was provisionally approved based on the principles decided by the provincial government conference. The main decisions involved three principles: (1) The land value tax rate should be 1.5% as stipulated by the Land Law (which is 100 times the pre-war rate). (2) Each yuan of land tax should be levied with one "shi dou" of grain, and the borrowing would be exempted. (3) The land tax revenue should be distributed to the national, provincial, and city governments in a ratio of 3:2:5.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Abolishes "Book Allowance": Petitioning by District Secretaries Causes Uproar</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi Dispatch] The field tax for this county this year has been officially levied. The registers created by the district secretaries have also been successively submitted to the County Land Tax Office for review. However, the district secretaries creating the field tax registers have historically received a "book allowance" to maintain their livelihood. Previously, the authorities abolished this bad practice, eliminating the book allowance. The district secretaries, concerned about their livelihoods, petitioned to have the decision reversed and requested relief. The County Government also submitted a request to the provincial government to allocate 30 million yuan as expenses for creating the registers, approximately 70,000 yuan per "tu" (a unit of land). The temporary council recently decided to temporarily allow the district secretaries to collect a subsidy fee of 50 yuan in legal tender per mu (a unit of land) from each household this year. However, the district secretaries believed that this meager amount could not sustain their families. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, more than 200 district secretaries from the entire county, holding paper flags, went to the city district office to petition. They then went to the County Government to petition. They were accompanied by District Chief Shen and received by Deputy Director Shen of the County Land Tax Office. Because the case involved a resolution from the temporary council, no definite answer was given. As they were about to go to the temporary council to petition, they suddenly saw Council Speaker Jiang [name obscured] in a chauffeured car. They immediately surrounded him, causing a chaotic scene. Speaker Jiang, seeing the unfavorable situation, waved his hands and shouted, "Let's talk this over!" He said that he sympathized with everyone and that the registers could be withheld until the allowance issue was resolved. He also said that if the authorities arrested them, he would be responsible for bailing them out. Hearing this, the district secretaries reluctantly returned. Afterwards, the Land Tax Office stated that the submission of the registers by the district secretaries could not be delayed any further. Anyone who resisted would be arrested by the grain police and prosecuted for obstructing official duties. The day before yesterday, all 416 "tu" district secretaries in the county issued an appeal to all sectors of society, calling for fair-minded people to provide righteous assistance, arguing that the statements made by Jiang and Shen were contradictory and left them at a loss. County Magistrate Xu Yuanruo, who recently went to the countryside to inspect, was furious after learning of the situation yesterday in Xicang. He sent a special commissioner back to the city with a personal note, ordering Secretary Huang to have Deputy Director Shen and District Chief Shen reconvene a meeting to warn the district secretaries about the incident of petitioning and surrounding Speaker Jiang, and forbid any further acts of coercing the authorities by gathering a crowd. The promises made by Speaker Jiang were considered invalid and the matter would be subject to mediation.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Plans to Build New Airport</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Dispatch] After the war, Hong Kong's aviation industry is becoming increasingly developed, and various civil aviation companies are hoping to build a new airport. The facilities at Kai Tak Airport have been deemed inadequate in recent years, and its location is not ideal, with mountains to the north and a runway that is too short for planes to take off and land. The Hong Kong authorities are planning to build a new-style airport. Engineers from the Public Works Department have already begun to formulate plans. The location for the new airport is a long stretch of land along the Deep Water Bay waterfront, requiring approximately 4 million pounds. The project is quite complex, requiring the blasting of 4 million cubic feet of rock. It will take eighteen months to complete the process of filling the Deep Water Bay waterfront with the blasted rock. After the new airport is built, the original site of Kai Tak Airport will be converted into a new residential area.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob Wedding Feast: Hosts and Guests Suffer Together</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiading Dispatch] At 9:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, at the home of Zhang Jiaoqiao Dong Chuansheng in Huangdu, Jiading County, while the guests were joyfully drinking at the wedding feast, more than 20 bandits suddenly broke in, armed with No. 3 Mauser pistols and revolvers. They robbed the wedding gifts and the guests of cash totaling more than one million yuan, more than 20 pieces of jewelry, gold rings, and watches, and one self-defense rifle. The victims reported the incident to the Huangdu Public Self-Defense Force, and the instructor led his troops in pursuit, exchanging fire with the bandits for about ten minutes before the bandits fled north.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Trial for Shooting Husband Concludes: Verdict to be Announced on the 31st; Female Protagonist Asks for Lenient Sentence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] The trial of Ye Suming, the female protagonist in the sensational shooting of her husband, which previously caused a great stir, took place at the Wu District Court on the afternoon of the 25th. The one-day trial was presided over by female Judge Wang Xiuqing, and the verdict is set to be announced on the 31st of this month. Details are as follows: Ye Suming, a woman from Nanhai, Guangdong, is currently 19 years old. She used to work as a ticket seller at a theater in Guangxi. In late August of the 34th year of the Republic, she met Xu Maolin, a captain in the motor transport corps who had recently returned from India and Burma, through a friend's introduction. They fell in love at first sight and got engaged and started living together. She followed him to Shanghai and Nanjing, and eventually to Suzhou, where he was stationed, renting a house in a civilian residence in Xibaidu. Initially, they were very affectionate, but after arriving in Suzhou, Xu's feelings suddenly cooled, and he repeatedly stated that he wanted a divorce. In mid-July of this year (only half a month after arriving in Suzhou), they mutually wrote divorce papers in an agreement, and Xu immediately left Suzhou for Shanghai. He returned to Suzhou after staying in Shanghai for more than ten days and coincidentally ran into Ye outside [obscured character] Gate. They went to the suburbs for a walk, and after arriving at home late at night without anyone to open the door, Ye slept with Xu in the troop's dormitory. The next day, on August 11th, at around 3:00 PM, Ye was still lying in bed, playing with Xu's revolver. She accidentally pulled the trigger, and the bullet hit Xu Maolin's chest, a vital spot, who was sitting in a swivel chair in front of the bed, and he died on the spot. Three colleagues were in the same room at the time, napping. They were awakened by the sound and saw Ye standing still by the door with the gun, while Xu was dead in the chair. They first snatched the weapon and attempted to assess Xu's injuries, at which point Ye seized the opportunity to flee to the train station. After dispatching personnel to apprehend her, they found Ye standing motionless in the station and arrested her, taking her to the local prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution, and then to the criminal court for trial. Judge Wang asked if she had a motive of hate. Ye replied, "We only lived together for more than ten months before separating. Although I cannot avoid the pain, I do not hate him, hating is useless. As for the shooting, it was purely accidental. If I intended to kill him, why would I do it in his troop's dormitory during the day? This shows that it was truly unintentional." At this point, the court asked if she had any requests. Ye replied, "Please have mercy on me for being young and ignorant, causing this great disaster, and also for being more than four months pregnant. I ask for a lenient sentence." After the prosecutor's arguments and the defense lawyer's arguments, the court concluded the hearing and set the pronouncement for 4:00 PM on the 31st of this month.</p>

<h3>Songjiang Demolishes City Walls to Build Roads</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Songjiang Dispatch] The city walls of this county have been dilapidated for many years and are of no practical use. The temporary council previously resolved to demolish the northeast gates first and build a ring road around the city. This resolution was reported to the county and then to the province, but it has not been implemented due to lack of funds. Now, the Shanghai Song Li Ji Construction Company is willing to contract this project and, in accordance with the resolution, use materials as payment for labor.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Arrests a Traitor</h3>
<p>Yin Jiating Also Charged with Drug Addiction</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi Dispatch] Yin Jiating, a local resident, willingly collaborated with the enemy during the puppet regime period. He served as the chief of the general affairs section of the Anhui Rihua Miscellaneous Grain Trade Purchasing and Transportation Office, the chief of general affairs of the Rihua Joint Stock Company, and the director of grain purchasing and transportation in Linhuai Pass on the Jinpu Railway. Under the enemy's grain control, he used his power to forcibly purchase and transport grain, manipulating grain prices and oppressing the people. After the victory, he went into hiding in Shanghai for a time. Recently, he quietly returned to Wuxi, engaging in large-scale construction of new buildings, attracting the attention of neighbors. Yesterday, after being reported by someone, the police station sent officers to arrest him. At the time, a large number of smoking paraphernalia and opium dross were seized.

<h3>Luo Beichen Goes to Suzhou to Expand Insurance Business</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 27th Dispatch] In order to help stabilize family life and reduce the impact of life problems on family finances, the Central Trust Bureau is extensively expanding its life insurance business. The Life Insurance Department of the Bureau has drafted a price index group life insurance charter, which has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Luo Beichen, the manager of the department, came to Suzhou from Shanghai on the 26th. At a tea party held at 3:00 PM, he invited members of the local press and prominent figures from local legal and political organizations to explain the price index group life insurance business in detail. He pointed out that its special feature is that the government's treatment of civil servants is meager. In the event of a life change, not only is there no money for funeral expenses, but also the maintenance of the surviving family becomes difficult. The compensation stipulated in the compensation regulations is only a drop in the bucket, and does not meet the living conditions of the present era. Therefore, this method is specifically designed to provide relief. It is completely different from ordinary commercial life insurance. Currently, the insured amount is tentatively set from 500,000 yuan to 5 million yuan. The premium is 2 per thousand per month. It is hoped that various [obscured characters] factories and other organizations can bear or subsidize the insurance premiums of employees, regarding it as a legitimate welfare expense. The China Trust Bureau has now suggested to the Ministry of Finance to forward [obscured characters] to the National Defense Commission, asking it to issue a notice to the employees of all provincial and municipal [obscured characters] affiliated [obscured characters] that the insurance premiums for life insurance [obscured characters] regular expenses can be implemented once it is approved. Mr. Luo, in his capacity as the chairman of the National Insurance Association Federation, called for attention to the issue of stamp duty on insurance businesses, stating that the current stamp duty on the insurance industry is a double levy. In addition to the insurance policy requiring a payment of one-twentieth of the premium, the premium receipt also requires a tax rate of 3 per thousand. This is a major threat to the insurance industry, which serves society and benefits the people. A resolution has been made after the convocation of a national temporary representatives' meeting to [obscured character] representatives to petition in Beijing, requesting the abolition of the stamp duty of the insurance industry [obscured characters] progress [obscured character], and according to the pre-war regulations, the maximum amount of the two taxes is 15,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jintan Field Tax Collection Begins</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jintan Dispatch] This county's field tax was previously exempted for one year by order of the central government, but will be officially collected from this autumn onwards. However, the property rights of land in this county have changed greatly during the period of enemy occupation. The county government has specially ordered district "tu" secretaries to reorganize and compile the field grain registers. The reorganization has now been completed, and the field tax for the 35th year of the Republic will be collected from the 25th of this month.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially dispatched inspectors of the people [obscured character] Rong Sheng and Liu Yiyusheng, a staff member of the Security Command, as two supervisory committee members to inspect the county's security and suppression situation. In order to understand the areas where bandits are rampaging and coordinate with the anti-bandit troops, they have been going to various townships for inspections in the past few days, together with County Magistrate Shen, to educate the people and mobilize them to suppress bandits.</p>
<h3>Opium Found Hidden in Mailed Package: Secret Discovered During On-the-Spot Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] The [obscured character] Gate Post Office in this city received a package No. 1606 from Xuzhou Post Office on the 23rd of this month. The package cloth was marked with the sender's information as Hao Zengfan of Xiechengtai, 16 Sidao Street, Xuzhou, addressed to Xu Jian, 98 Hulong Street, Suzhou. The contents were declared as leather clothing. The bureau immediately notified the addressee to come to the bureau to claim the package in person according to regulations. At 9:00 AM on the 25th, a person speaking with a guest accent came to the bureau with the claim form. The staff of the bureau immediately instructed the person to unpack the package and verify whether the contents matched the declared items according to regulations. However, when he unpacked it halfway, he suddenly became flustered and attempted to escape. The staff of the bureau also realized that something was wrong and restrained him, ordering him to continue unpacking. As a result, a package of opium wrapped in newspaper was found inside the leather clothing, weighing 360 grams (approximately 10 taels minus a little). The bureau immediately dispatched personnel to report to the responsible Fourth Sub-Bureau, and the police were dispatched to the bureau to take the recipient to the station. After questioning by Officer Wang, the person identified himself as Peng Zhaoli, 46 years old, from Pi County, a firewood merchant, currently residing at Jiajia Lou 4 Bao 4 Jia 5 Hu, Wannian Town. He confessed that the opium was privately trafficked in partnership with Hao Zengfan of Xuzhou. The police station also detained Xu Jian. According to his statement, he received the package slip the day before yesterday, but he did not know Hao Zengfan. Peng Zhaoli was a friend in the same industry. Yesterday, he came to his house and took away the package slip, and also borrowed his seal, which he did not allow. However, Peng secretly carved a seal and went to claim the package. He knew nothing about the private trafficking of opium. After interrogation, because the case involved private trafficking of drugs, he was sent to the Fourth Sub-Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Investigation:</h3>
<p>Luo Changming Detained for Embezzlement of Assets</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuhu Dispatch] Ma Jingdang, the leader of the investigation team, discovered yesterday that Luo Changming, the former director of the Social Service Office, received a large number of assets such as furniture from the China Hotel, but the transferred inventory was inconsistent with the actual items, indicating suspected concealment and embezzlement. It was also found that Luo had engaged in the sale of enemy and puppet materials. Therefore, Luo was detained and immediately transferred to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>ZhaPu Seawall: Gate Damaged</h3>
<p>Seawater Infiltration Creates a Perilous Situation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Pinghu Dispatch] The gates along the ZhaPu Seawall in this county have been in disrepair for many years and are mostly damaged, causing seawater to infiltrate, creating a perilous situation. Nearby fields are suffering from the seawater, which is flooding the area, severely impacting agricultural production. The Tenth District Commissioner's Office has telegraphed this county to quickly repair the gates in order to prevent a major disaster. The county government is rushing to produce drawings and formulate plans.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Coal Shortage: Coal Industry Requests Allocation</h3>
<p>[Wuxi Dispatch] The Wuxi Coal Industry Association has been established for one year, with more than one hundred members, whose business is mainly in coal [obscured characters] and the production of coal briquettes. The amount of coal [obscured characters] daily is enormous. Recently, coal [obscured character] industry, due to transportation difficulties, procurement is not easy, sources are few, often feel lack, affecting the really not [obscured character] fresh, therefore, specially [obscured character] Chamber of Commerce, request [obscured character] Coal Industry merchants difficult, on behalf of [obscured character] Ministry of Economic Affairs Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee and Shanghai Coal Industry Business Association, please [obscured character] give Hongji coal dross three hundred tons, [obscured character] Ji coal shortage.</p>

<h3>Baimao Sluice Gate: Water Conservancy Association Approves Opening</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dang [obscured character] Dispatch] The County Farmers' Association, etc., previously telegraphed requesting the opening of the Baimao Sluice Gate to discharge water because low-lying fields were flooded by storms, reaching more than 400,000 mu. However, the gate was under construction and could not be opened. It was then suggested to excavate the water barrier dam next to the gate, but the cost of construction and losses after opening the dam would be enormous. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission has reviewed the matter and telegraphed approval to open the gate. However, the cost of plugging the gate should be borne by [obscured character] party. The commission also sent Director Chen Qinglai to Changzhou on the 24th to convene a meeting with various agencies. After deliberation, it was decided to open the dam around the 27th and plug it within one month. For the plugging project, labor will be conscripted or a benefit fee will be collected, pending telegraphic instructions.</p>

<p>Admonishing Parents to Beware of Kidnappers</p>
<p>I have a piece of social news, is it possible to publish it in your esteemed journal? I read on the ninth page of your newspaper on the 16th, "Hong Kong Air News on the 7th" which stated: "...Macau has an organization for kidnapping children... they send people to Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou to find ways to kidnap children who 'meet the requirements.' According to my inquiries: A child of seven or eight years old, clever and with decent features, regardless of gender, is worth nearly one million national currency."</p>
<p>This kind of incident has clearly become a most serious problem in current society. Now in Yangzhou, children have repeatedly gone missing recently. As far as I know, in the past two weeks, four boys around the age of ten have disappeared. One of them is my relative, Zhou Zhengfu, a boy of eleven years old, from Hubei, who was in the sixth grade at Jiangdu County Elementary School and disappeared on October 1st on his way to school. We have searched extensively in all directions, but still, there is no trace. The child is clever and has decent features, also "meeting the requirements." Whether the aforementioned kidnappers have already sneaked into the mainland and abducted him, is unknown. But it can be concluded that similar kidnappers already exist in Yangzhou, carrying out their work. I advise parents with children to pay special attention, and I hope the local public security authorities will not ignore this report. (Zhang Yunyu)</p>
<p>No Reason for Another Ferry Price Increase</p>
<p>The city ferry, since April 1st of this year, has increased the price for crossing the river from 30 yuan to 100 yuan (4 cents pre-war). The long-distance line from Shanghai to Xidu has increased from 80 yuan to 200 yuan (8 cents pre-war). The current monthly income of the city ferry is around 200 million yuan, and the monthly expenditure is about 150 million yuan, with a surplus of 50 million yuan, used for repairs and allocation. Now, it is heard that the city ferry will raise prices again from November due to insufficient expenses. Among the Shanghai public utilities, such as ferries, trams, water, and electricity, the city ferry has the highest fees, exceeding pre-war fees by more than 2,500 times. If prices are raised again, there is no reason. Public utilities are not originally intended for profit. In the current situation, the city ferry should always consider the welfare of the citizens and social order and should not raise prices first, causing unrest among the people. (Pan Bosheng)</p>
<p>Grain Prices Are Disproportionate to Commodity Prices</p>
<p>I am an old commoner from the countryside, who has suffered greatly under the enemy. Everyone knows that China is an agricultural country. During the eight years, we villagers suffered under the enemy's tyranny and the monopoly of unscrupulous merchants, who devalued the price of rice every year at harvest time to be worse than the bran fed to pigs. This was originally the enemy's way to push China towards self-destruction and bankrupt our tenant farmers. Looking at the rice shortages in various rural areas in recent years, eight out of ten families are living hand to mouth, borrowing rice from others, isn't this a joke? You need to know that when they look forward to the harvest, the price of rice is devalued again! Paying off rice debts and various debts, plus buying some New Year's goods, they say that sixty to seventy percent of the harvest has already been spent. By the time a portion is left for next year's planting, the annual life is again trapped in the bitter situation of patching things together. Year after year, isn't it like Wang Xiaoer celebrating the New Year, getting worse and worse? Unexpectedly, more than a year has passed since the victory, and there is still no effect on improving life. The soaring prices of various commodities and the devaluation of rice prices, to what low level of cheapness, are unknown! The harvest season is approaching, and following the enemy's and puppet era's practice, relying on unscrupulous merchants' tricks, prices of all goods rise, and the fixed price of military rice allows military rice merchants to take the opportunity to hoard! In short, everything, during this rice harvest season, will cause you villagers to not be able to exchange all your sweat and blood for even two or three tenths of the value! No wonder people are anxious and cannot settle down! China's foundation is in danger, I hope the authorities will no longer ignore it. (Wu Weijiang)</p>
<p>The Lament of Small Businessmen in Shou County</p>
<p>I am a small businessman from Yingheji, Shou County, running a grocery store, selling cigarettes, sweets, and local wine. When business is good, I can make a living. Now business is not good, because the flood in Shou County is too heavy, and the heavy taxes are too great. Since last month, a Director Gao came to the commodity tax bureau, and he is truly formidable, leading tax soldiers like wolves and tigers all day, searching door to door, causing unrest. When they see cigarettes bought from other ports, even if the small box has a inspection certificate affixed to it, they say it is illegal and must have a stamp. If there is no stamp, either they collect the tax or they impose a fine. In fact, what kind of stamp he is referring to, no one has ever seen. Even eight to ten pounds of white sugar must be reported for tax and must also have a distribution document. Poor small businessmen selling a few pounds of sugar, where would they get a distribution document? Zhongshan cigarettes from the Daxing Tobacco Factory in Yingheji, have never been seen with inspection certificates affixed, and they are sold in the market just the same, and no one says they are illegal. There are nearly two hundred wine merchants in the nearby dozen townships, and each merchant must pay 17,000 yuan, even 23,000 yuan per month, saying they have a receipt, but they never show it. Is this what they mean by simplified collection methods? It is truly perplexing. (Ren Xin)</p>
<p>Six Contributions to Nursery Schools</p>
<p>Nursery schools are a public social service to solve the suffering of working civilians, but all the nursery schools in the city are unsound. They are not suitable for civilians, and there is no reasonable solution for children's hygiene, education, and parents' finances and time. This is a common problem in all nursery schools in the city. I hope that the old ones can improve and the new ones can find ways to avoid these problems. You should know that running a public service requires responsibility and serving as public servants.</p>
<p>Now I will put forward a few points of my opinion for the consideration of those who run nursery schools: (1) The building must be relatively spacious, and the environment should be quiet and the air fresh. (2) The fees must not exceed 60,000 yuan (this is the highest limit of the economy of civilians, and nursery schools are of course established for civilians). (3) The location should be in the suburbs but also near the center, with a branch office set up in a temporary school or church. Every Saturday noon, parents can come to pick up their children and take them home. And on Monday morning, the children can be handed over to the office, and the office will use a vehicle to transport them back to the nursery school. (4) The nursery should refuse any rewards, so that nurses do not give special preferential treatment to one child, which would lead to class problems. (5) Security deposits should not be charged. A surety method can be used to reduce the burden on parents. (6) Absolute attention must be paid to children's diet, nutrition, and physical records. The above points are only a general outline. I hope that those who are interested in social work will pay attention to them. (Yu Wenhua)</p>
<p>Refusal to Accept Customs Gold Units for Fine Payment</p>
<p>Previously (on the 19th), I drove to the bicycle registration and tax inspection office on Jiangning Road to pay the tax for the second half of this year. Because it was past the specified date, I had to pay a fine of 2,000 yuan according to the regulations. I submitted five 20 yuan Customs Gold Unit notes to the fine payment window for exchanging the license, and the collector glared at me and said: "This place only accepts legal tender, not Customs Gold Units." May I ask, are Customs Gold Units and legal tender not of equal value? Since I only had Customs Gold Unit notes with me, I had to leave the office and exchange them at a nearby cigarette stall before paying. I respectfully request that the responsible authorities clarify this matter to avoid causing taxpayers more trouble! (Yinsheng respectfully)</p>

<h3>To Prevent the Abuse of Veto Power Britain Formulates Secret Plan Gu Weijun Scheduled to Deliver Speech Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 26th United Press] According to British Foreign Office personnel: Britain has formulated a secret plan to prevent the Soviet Union from "recklessly" using its veto power in the Security Council. Britain's plan will be implemented at the United Nations General Assembly at an appropriate time. The content of the plan cannot be disclosed at present, otherwise, it will hinder its final success. In addition, British foreign policy experts admit that the hope of this plan's immediate success is extremely slim. The British Foreign Office does not believe that the Soviet Union's withdrawal of its opposition to the United Nations' discussion of the veto power is an indication of a change in Soviet attitude. The general public believes that the Soviet Union's participation in this world organization is entirely based on the fundamental principle of unanimous agreement among the major powers, as claimed by Moscow. The first step in Britain's strategy may be to make a strong representation to the Soviet Union, stating that the vast majority of countries in the United Nations oppose the Soviet Union's policy of using the veto power as a political weapon. However, some observers believe that the Soviet Union has no reason to change its policy because of this. Public opinion outside the Soviet sphere of influence has no effect on the Kremlin. Moscow Radio discussed Cuba and Australia's proposal in New York today to abolish the veto power, clarifying the Soviet Union's attitude on this issue, stating that they were selected to engage in this kind of work in order to cover up the reactionary Anglo-American group's attempt to undermine the consensus of the major powers, because the principle of unanimous agreement among the major powers cannot adapt to their self-governing world attempts.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Special Dispatch] Among the ten people scheduled to speak to the United Nations General Assembly on the morning of the 28th, our chief representative Gu Weijun is also one of them. It is expected that Gu will discuss China's position on the veto power issue. Gu will be the second speaker among the representatives of the five major powers, the first being Britain's Baker. For the past three days, most of the speakers have been representatives of small countries, and the discussions have focused on the veto power issue and the Spanish issue. The coordinating or steering committee, composed of 14 countries, will hold secret meetings on the mornings and evenings of the 28th to continue reviewing the provisional agenda. So far, the committee has approved 45 of the 53 items on the agenda. The Security Council will also reconvene under the new chairman, Cadogan, after a long recess, to discuss Switzerland's proposal to participate in the International Court of Justice as a non-member state. According to the Charter, non-member states can also participate in the court after being recommended by the Security Council and approved by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 26th] As the United Nations General Assembly concludes its first week of debate, the veto power of the five major powers remains the number one explosive issue, and the growing pressure may force a clear definition of the use of the veto power. After days of speeches by representatives from 13 countries and several tense committee meetings, it is clear that there is little possibility of amending the Charter to abolish the veto power at this time. The Soviet Union has used its veto power nine times in the Security Council. The current goal seems to be to force it to agree to amend the way the veto power is used. Norway, Chile, and Turkey joined the movement to limit the use of the veto power today. The representatives who spoke earlier also expressed regret over the "excessive" and "arbitrary" use of the veto power. According to Norwegian representative Lange, the time is not yet ripe to amend the United Nations Charter, but he asked the major powers to establish an agreement on the use of the veto power themselves, using it only as a last resort. Turkish representative Bedu said that humanity often depends on the will of the majority, and there is no reason to include the veto power as an exception, but in the transitional period, the veto power may not be abolished immediately. At least, a method should be considered to limit the scope of its use. Chilean representative Holivo also said that the most important task of the United Nations organization is to determine human rights and its basic freedoms. Chile does not support amending the Charter at this time but hopes that the major powers will do their best to limit the use of the veto power.</p>
<h3>India Contends for a Seat on the Security Council The UK Decides to Give Full Support The Indian Flag Flies in Front of the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 26th] Among the flags of 50 countries in front of the United Nations venue, there is also the Indian flag. However, according to an Indian representative, the flag is not the Indian national flag, but the flag of the Governor-General of India. As far as the Indian delegation is concerned, this matter is not of any importance. India currently does not have a national flag and is planning to design a flag that can represent the national government and includes the flags of the Congress Party and the Muslim League.</p>
<p>Regarding India's application for a seat on the Security Council, the British delegation has decided to support it. The UK will oppose the Soviet Union's suggestion to nominate Norway as a director. British sources often mention three candidate directors, namely Belgium, Colombia, and Syria. The UK may withdraw its support for Belgium because, for the benefit of Western democracies, Europe already has the UK and France participating in the Security Council. It is reported that the United States will support Colombia to succeed Mexico, whose term has expired.</p>
<h3>Foreign Secretary Bevin Departs for the United States</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to travel by plane from here to Southampton Port tomorrow morning with his private secretary Dickson and Assistant Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office Sir Harvey to board the postal ship "Aquitania" to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. The ship will stop at Cherbourg, France, to pick up representatives from other countries attending the United Nations General Assembly and go to New York together.</p>
<h3>British Policy Toward Spain</h3>
<p>Unaffected by Trades Union Congress Resolutions</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Although the Trades Union Congress in Brighton resolved to demand that the British government immediately sever relations with Spain, it is expected that Foreign Secretary Bevin will not be affected by this resolution. The British government has repeatedly stated that severing relations with Spain would only strengthen the Franco regime's position in Spain. The British government and trade union organizations have the same attitude toward the Franco regime, the only difference is in the methods. The House of Commons and the Labor Party have recently heard Bevin explain his attitude towards Spain and have expressed their support for this policy.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Not Give Up Governance of Pacific Islands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 26th United Press] It is learned that the United States will soon take preliminary steps to hand over the Caroline and Marshall Islands to the proposed United Nations Trusteeship Council for management. Officials said that this kind of actual trusteeship may not be formulated immediately for a considerable period of time. The Pacific islands, which were obtained through hard battles, will still be governed by the United States during the transition period. The United States' announcement of its intention to hand over the island's land for trusteeship does not mean that the United States is giving up governance.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Yugoslavia to Return Home for Consultations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th Special Dispatch] The US State Department announced today that the US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Patterson, will fly back to Washington from Belgrade. Patterson's return home is only a private action and is not of any importance. However, it is believed that Patterson's return home, like the return home of Ambassador Smith to the Soviet Union and Ambassador Leen to Poland in the past two weeks, is not accidental. The return home of the ambassadors to the Soviet Union and the pro-Soviet countries of Yugoslavia and Poland may indicate the tension in US-Soviet relations and discussions among senior officials on a policy of patience and firmness towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 26th] President Tito has recently made repeated speeches, criticizing the failure of the Paris Peace Conference and saying that our rights have not been correctly recognized by our wartime allies. The Atlantic Charter is just an empty promise.</p>

<h3>To Maintain World Peace The US Must Ensure Naval Strength President Truman Issues Navy Day Message</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Yesterday was the US Navy Memorial Day. US military leaders declared that to maintain world peace, the US military strength must be maintained. President Truman praised the US Navy in a special message and hoped that the people of the whole country would carry forward the spirit of serving the country.</p>
<p>Nimitz Emphasizes the Importance of the Navy</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Indianapolis, USA, 26th] Today is US Navy Day, and Admiral Nimitz delivered a speech here, saying that until an international police force is established, the US Navy should still be prepared to mobilize at any time. As long as mankind needs to transport materials from one continent to another via sea routes, the US Navy will still be indispensable. The naval authorities should not underestimate the danger of the atomic bomb. We should know in what direction naval strategy will develop to avoid new dangers. Submarines must operate in very deep waters to be effective. The US Navy's current strength is equivalent to one-sixth of its wartime strength.</p>
<p>The United States Must Obtain Control of the Two Oceans</p>
<p>[Reuters, Boston, 26th] US Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Vice Admiral Sherman delivered a speech here today, saying that the United States must obtain sea and air control over the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Without our people in Europe, Europe cannot maintain balance and stability. Obtaining sea and air control of the two oceans is a prerequisite for protecting the Western Hemisphere. Others may bomb the United States from the air via the Arctic, but if the United States is strong enough to retaliate, it will not be a major problem.</p>
<p>Atomic Submarines Are New Weapons of War</p>
<p>[Reuters, Kansas City, 27th] Rear Admiral Starr, Director of Underwater Warfare of the US Navy, delivered a speech on Navy Day, saying that in the navy of the future, long-range submarines equipped with atomic rocket guns or atomic missiles and powered by atomic energy will occupy a very important position. Submarines powered by atomic energy can maintain very high speeds underwater and can make unlimited long-range voyages. In terms of self-defense, aerial atomic bombs or radar detection have less effect on this type of submarine. In terms of offense, its atomic rocket gun equipment is the most powerful offensive weapon.</p>
<p>China Declares Acceptance of the Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun submitted a declaration from the Chinese government to United Nations Secretary-General Lie today, stating that it accepts the judicial jurisdiction of the League of Nations Court. The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands have already submitted similar declarations. This declaration by the Chinese government is valid for a period of five years and can be extended indefinitely. If there are any changes, six months' notice must be given.</p>
<h3>Relief Work for the Famine Will Be Handled by the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: United Nations Secretary-General Lie received documents from UNRRA Director La Guardia today, stating that Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and China will encounter serious food shortages when UNRRA is dissolved in early 1947. Lie said that if necessary, he can propose specific measures to deal with relief work after the end of UNRRA.</p>
<h3>The Trumans Go to the Villa to Spend the Weekend</h3>

<h3>Rumors of Agreement Reached in British-Egyptian Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] The 13-member Egyptian delegation led by Egyptian Prime Minister Seeteki flew back to Egypt this morning. Seeteki did not make any statements before leaving. Cairo newspapers said that an agreement has been reached in the negotiations, and the UK has accepted the Egyptian view on the Sudan issue, making the area part of the Egyptian kingdom.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Authorities Are Working Hard to Study German Technical Secrets German Factory Technicians Are Transferred to Soviet Territory The Hamburg Council Urges the UK to Take Action</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hal, Germany, 26th] At the end of World War II, Germany invented a jet-propelled aircraft with a speed of 750 miles per hour. The plan was ready, but before it could be manufactured, Germany collapsed. The Soviet army advanced into Berlin, seeking the original plan, but General Baden's Third Army of the United States took the lead. The Soviet Union was disappointed. Because flying at 750 miles per hour is equal to the speed of sound, it is the maximum speed of the aircraft, and the Soviet Union is determined to study the secrets of this aircraft. A few months ago, the Soviet Union was busy gathering specialists who had worked in the Siebel aircraft factory in Hal before the war to restore their work and report the results of their research to the Soviet authorities. It is reported that this plan was almost completed in early autumn this year. These technicians were paid 600 marks per month, but they often received bonuses, sometimes as much as 10,000 marks, and they also received special allocations of food and cigarettes. At that time, these technicians signed contracts stipulating that they would be sent to work in the Soviet Union when necessary. This contract has now been forgotten. Recently, the Allied Control Council for Germany decided to organize an investigation committee to investigate whether all the arms factories in Germany are being dismantled. The Soviet authorities realized that this work must be intensified, but they did not take any action before the local elections in Germany. It was not until the 25th of this month that the factory began to be dismantled, and according to the contract, 250 workers and mechanics were sent to the Soviet Union. These workers signed new contracts, guaranteeing to stay in the Soviet Union for five years, with monthly salaries as high as 5,000 marks. Most of the workers were quite satisfied with the generous treatment, but some workers also felt uneasy, because they were guarded by sentries at the train station, who told them that anyone who tried to escape would be shot.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] The Council of the British military district passed a resolution protesting the transfer of German workers and their families to other countries and demanding that the UK take action in the Allied Control Council. Reports received here stated that the first phase of the Soviet Union's transportation of German factories focused on rocket, jet, and V-weapon factories and scientific laboratories. These factories are mostly located in Mecklenburg, Saxony, Thuringia, and the Harz Mountains. German officials working under the Soviet authorities estimated that as many as 50,000 German workers, technicians, and their families, and even girlfriends, have been transferred from Germany to the Soviet Union. A worker from the Zeiss lens factory escaped to the British military district by bicycle. He said that some of the Soviet soldiers, some of whom were drunk, beat workers who were unwilling to go to the Soviet Union with the butts of their rifles, and women and children screamed in horror. Soviet newspapers in Berlin said that the transfer of German workers to the Soviet Union was all with their consent. Several representatives of the Siemens factory who came here from Yena a few days ago have sent a telegram to Stalin on behalf of the workers, asking him not to dismantle the factory's equipment.

<h3>Su Ruo Continues to Accuse US Policies; US Will Not Loan to Soviet Union; Byrnes Formally Declares to the Press</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] If the Soviet leaders do not cease criticizing the United States' foreign and economic policies, their application for a $1 billion loan from the United States is bound to be hopeless. Similarly, it will also be difficult for Czechoslovakia and Poland to jointly obtain an $850 million loan from the "World Bank," which is dominated by the United States. US Secretary of State Byrnes recently stated clearly when receiving reporters that in the future, US economic assistance will only be given to friendly countries that do not accuse monetary loans as instruments of economic enslavement. According to unofficial official sources, Byrnes' remarks are mainly aimed at the Soviet Union's accusations that the US aid program to Eastern European countries is monetary diplomacy, economic enslavement, and economic imperialism. Three months ago, the United States issued a third note to the Soviet Union regarding the loan issue and is now awaiting its reply. The Soviet Union is unwilling to agree in advance to combine the loan with an examination of the economic situation in Eastern Europe, resulting in a stalemate in actual negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union to date.</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Policy: Maintaining Friendship with All Countries</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 26th] The bloc of democratic parties in Romania recently held a meeting to begin their election campaign. Foreign Minister Tătărescu delivered a speech on the spot, emphasizing that close cooperation between Romania and the Soviet Union and all democratic countries should be regarded as the foundation of foreign policy. He also said: The future, security, and development of our country all depend on the solidity of our mutual friendship and the closeness of cooperation between us and the peoples of the Soviet Union, but this does not mean that we want to pursue a policy of isolation. The distinctive feature of our foreign policy must be to maintain friendly relations with all democratic countries in the West, especially Britain, the United States, and France. Moreover, we should strengthen mutual relations with our democratic neighbors, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. We have never been isolated from each of these countries due to differences of opinion. As for Hungary, we have absolute confidence in it and will certainly find ways to establish understanding and friendly relations with it.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The State Department released a report last night on the disposal of assets of Japanese zaibatsu, stipulating that the assets of major Japanese industries and zaibatsu will be transferred to small merchants and artisans, so as to evenly distribute wealth in Japan and maintain balance among all social classes.

<h3>New Type of Ore Smelting Furnace</h3>
<p>Invented by Soviet Scientists</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] According to TASS, Soviet scientists have invented a new type of ore smelting furnace that can directly smelt steel from ore and pig iron without intermediate procedures. The new type of ore smelting furnace, with the help of automatic transportation, can melt ore into pig iron, and then smelt pig iron into steel, continuously. Its special advantage is that it does not need to use coking coal, only bituminous coal is needed, and even bituminous coal can be used.</p>
<h3>Göring's Special Method of Hiding Poison: First Swallow the Medicine Tube, Then Retrieve It from Feces</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Heilford City, 26th] The four-nation commission investigating Göring's suicide case issued a report in Nuremberg tonight, believing that neither the prison authorities nor the German staff were guilty of any wrongdoing. The report stated: After detailed investigation by this commission, the conclusions obtained are as follows: (1) Göring had poison hidden when he was first arrested and kept it until the night of October 15, 1946, (2) Evidence shows that Göring hid the poison in the muscle of his navel, (3) Evidence also shows that Göring kept the poison hidden there throughout his imprisonment, sometimes swallowing the medicine tube into his abdomen and then retrieving it from his feces for storage. The warden, US Colonel Andrews, and his staff took every necessary measure to prevent Göring from committing suicide, and everything that could be done was done, so there is no guilt to speak of. According to the British military doctor of the Nuremberg Court, the navel of an obese person like Göring is very deep and can accommodate a small tube of poison. If swallowed into the abdomen, it can be completely undetected within 24 hours, unless viewed with X-rays to find the metal tube in his abdomen. As for swallowing the metal tube into the abdomen, it is not necessarily harmful to his digestive function.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 26th] British General Walsh and French General Morrell told reporters at the Nuremberg Court today: Göring's three letters of will have been sent to the Allied Management Committee and are unlikely to be published. Judging from Göring's letter to Warden Andrews, the guards seem to have nothing to do with the suicide case.</p>

<h3>Cotton and Tobacco Fields in the American South: Night in Greenville (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Mao Shuqing, Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in the United States</p>
<p>More than eighty years after the Civil War, the American South and North are still two worlds. The industry of the North has become the economic overlord of the world after more than eighty years. Although the South also has industry, the social economy is generally still dominated by agriculture. The enterprising and enlightened nature of the people in the North is in stark contrast to the simple and conservative nature of the people in the South. Take black slaves as an example! President Lincoln fought a four-year "Civil War" in order to liberate black slaves. The Civil War was won, but were black slaves liberated? This is still a question. I took a train from Chicago to Tennessee, and after passing Cincinnati all the way, I</p>
<p>Implemented "Separate Seating on Trains"</p>
<p>From Knoxville, Tennessee, to the long-distance bus in South Carolina, white people sat in order from the front to the back, and black people sat in order from the back to the front. When the two sides "met," the driver shouted "Full." In this way, later passengers had to wait for the next bus. The buses were very crowded, running from midnight to day, with many shifts, all long, 50 percent longer than the public buses in Shanghai and Chongqing. The seats in the car were very comfortable, with reclining chair backs that could be freely rotated. Luggage was placed in the compartment between the tires and the passenger compartment, which did not take up space and did not have to worry about being exposed to the wind and dew on the roof. People all along the way in North and South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia like to take public buses. There are two reasons: first,</p>
<p>Southerners Are Frugal</p>
<p>Public buses are cheaper than trains; second, this road is mostly mountainous, and trains travel relatively slowly because they climb mountains, so most of the passenger traffic on trains is taken by public buses. The bus runs on dangerous mountain roads. The famous "Great Smoky Mountains" (also translated as Smoghan Mountains) between Tennessee and North Carolina are all narrow mountain roads with 90-degree turns, similar to the Sichuan-Hunan Highway in China. I was really worried that his long bus would not be able to turn around. After five hours over the Great Smoky Mountains, the bus stopped in Asheville, North Carolina; I did not get off the bus there and went straight to Greenville, South Carolina. Along the way, there were quiet and lovely rural areas, with small bridges and flowing water dotted between the fields, and scarecrows standing in the wheat fields, similar to Chinese farmhouses.</p>
<p>Greenville City</p>
<p>Has 76,000 people, with 40,000 people living in the city and more than 30,000 people scattered in the suburbs. Although the city is small, it also has a bustling scene. The residents have a very high level of education. There is a men's liberal arts college and a women's liberal arts college in the small city. Southerners are more conservative and religious than anything else; social interaction between men and women is not as unrestrained as in the North. I found the Bureau of Commerce on the upper floor of the Liberty Building in Greenville. A female secretary helped me find out the number of overseas Chinese and their residences. She spent a lot of time and found a Tom Lee. She said: Tom Lee is the only Chinese person in the city. He is the owner of a laundry shop. In fact, Tom Lee returned to China more than ten years ago, and the current laundry shop owner is called Fang Laofang. He is from Kaiping, Guangdong. Three years ago, he came to Greenville City to take over this laundry shop. His predecessor was not Tom Lee either. For business convenience, the old shopkeeper can hand over the business one after another, and the laundry shop's brand name remains the same. Lao Fang said: From the time Tom Lee founded the shop to him, there have been five or six major changes. He said: He is indeed residing in this</p>
<p>The Only Chinese</p>
<p>However, although there are no Chinese; there are many people who understand China in this small city, most of whom are missionaries. I went to Greenville to visit a foreign teacher who taught me English fifteen years ago: Mr. and Mrs. Rowland and Douvis, but I missed them. The Douvis couple resided in Honolulu during the war and have not returned to the United States for more than ten years. Residents of small cities in the South are more cordial to unfamiliar foreigners. When I was disappointed in finding someone, I met a strong middle-aged man, Bergway, who was Douvis' childhood best friend. Dou went to China to preach, and he still stayed in the United States. He said: Every time Douvis came back, he would talk a lot about China, "His Chinese stories are endless, and he can talk for half a year." Bergway has a very good image of China. He is a graduate of the local liberal arts college. His wife, Xue Lansi, is a scholar and a virtuous housewife.</p>

<h3>Conveners of Various Groups of the Municipal Council Hold a Joint Meeting Today: Should the Water Contract with the British Company Be Extended? All Members Provide Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our report] The conveners of various committees of the Municipal Council are scheduled to hold their first joint meeting at 3 pm today to discuss the Municipal Government's proposal to take back the Shanghai Water Company or allow it to postpone the contract for ten years. The British Shanghai Water Company signed an exclusive contract with the former Public Concession Bureau in 1905, which was revised on March 17, 1928, with a valid period of 20 years (from January 1, 1927 to July 1, 1947). The contract stated that if the Bureau wanted to take it back, it must formally notify two years before the expiration date (ie, before January 1, 1945), otherwise it would be extended for ten years. After the restoration of the city last year, the Executive Yuan issued a telegraph instruction from the Chairman, stating that the contracts of the Tram Company and the Water Company will expire in one or two years, and that the recovery should be studied after the expiration date. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau notified the Water Company on October 26, 1945, that the contract would not be continued and recovered after the expiration date for public operation. Informal exchanges of views were also conducted with the company. The company did not object to the repurchase, but stated that the notification was issued after the contract stipulated "two years before the expiration date," so the company declared its reservation. The Municipal Government's policy on the company's disposal after the expiration of the contract was discussed at the municipal meeting. The legal capital of the company has been increased to 40,236 shares of 20-pound face value stock and 359,280 shares of 1-pound face value stock, totaling £1,164,000, plus taels 2,000,000 of treasury silver and 3,000,000 yuan of national currency. The actual paid-up capital is £1,163,225, plus taels 2,000,000 of treasury silver. The 1905 contract stipulated that 975 shares of 20-pound face value stock should be donated to the Public Concession Bureau. Subsequently, the Bureau purchased 3,208 shares of 20-pound face value Class A stock, 15,660 shares of 1-pound face value Class B stock, and 50,000 shares of 1-pound face value Class C stock, totaling £129,820. At present, the Concession has been recovered, and the city has the shares of the former Public Concession Bureau, so the company is actually a joint venture between the government and merchants. According to the principle passed by the 148th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, under the premise of not hindering sovereignty and the implementation of the plan, foreign capital can be absorbed in various ways. It seems that there is no need to rush to recover it. Moreover, the city has just been restored, and the reconstruction and construction require a lot of funds. If a large amount of money is raised in a short period of time as funds to recover the company, it will be difficult to raise funds given the city's financial difficulties. Therefore, it is proposed to approve the extension of the term for ten years and negotiate to revise the contract, with the aim of safeguarding sovereignty and developing public utilities. A letter was sent to the Municipal Council for discussion and reply. After the Council approved the letter, it was considered to be of great importance. During the recess, in order to thoroughly understand the opinions of the councilors and to quickly decide on a policy to reply to the Municipal Government, letters were sent to solicit the opinions of the councilors, and it was proposed to submit all the information to the first joint meeting of the conveners of various committee groups held at 3 pm today for discussion and decision, in order to remedy the situation.</p>

These clinic cars have been built and will be presented to the President in Beijing on his birthday. After that, they will regularly run on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, providing medical treatment for employees of the two roads, railway police, their families, passengers, etc., at small and medium-sized stations without hospitals and clinics. The clinic cars are converted from 20-ton cargo cars. The cars are divided into medical rooms, bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens, toilets, etc., and all emergency medical supplies are complete.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Area Should Be Expanded</h3>
<p>[Our report] The demarcation of the border between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province has not yet been completely decided. A certain important person has informally stated that the area of ​​Shanghai must be expanded. Because the standard of a modern city is that the population per square mile is most reasonable at 5,000 to 10,000 people; but today Shanghai has a small land area and a dense population, with the highest density being 200,000 people per square mile, which is very detrimental to the health of the citizens.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Donates to Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Two Prefabricated Houses Completed with Ample Light and Air</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association recently received a donation of two prefabricated houses from the U.S. Navy. These have now been erected at the Association's First Sanatorium on Hongqiao Road. Yesterday morning, members of the press were specially invited to visit. These prefabricated houses are semi-circular, supported by stone blocks at the four corners, raising them about one foot off the ground to prevent dampness. Both walls are made of glass windows, providing excellent light and air. One of them is now equipped with seventeen free beds, while the other is temporarily used as a living room and dining hall.</p>
<p>American Red Cross Donates Beds. The Anti-Tuberculosis Association was established in 1937, with Mr. Yan Huiqing as its chairman. It currently operates two sanatoriums. The First Sanatorium on Hongqiao Road originally had 72 beds, which, with the addition of 17, now totals 89. Among these, seven are first-class, four are second-class, twenty-four are third-class, and the rest are free. The Second Sanatorium on Yuyuan Road has approximately thirty beds. Recently, the American Red Cross donated 250 beds to all anti-tuberculosis organizations in the city, and this sanatorium will also receive a portion. Regarding fees, the daily cost of hospitalization is 28,000 yuan for first-class, 15,000 yuan for second-class, and 3,000 yuan for third-class, with the cost of medication extra. The income from these first, second, and third-class beds subsidizes the free beds.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties Often Felt. Yesterday, the Association's General Secretary Huang Jiali and Doctor Liang Weizhen reported on the importance of tuberculosis prevention and the current situation of the sanatorium. Regarding funding, apart from a small subsidy from the Executive Yuan, most of it relies on external donations, which is often a struggle. In terms of medical equipment, items such as bronchoscopes, X-ray films, and surgical instruments are lacking. They hope that all sectors of society will generously donate. The Association will also promote anti-tuberculosis stamps before Christmas this year, both to raise funds and to promote tuberculosis prevention.</p>
<h3>Silk Cooperative Factory Approved by the Executive Yuan, Soon to Be Established</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau attaches great importance to the unemployment problem among workers in this city. In addition to working with relevant agencies to provide worker reception and unemployment relief, it also plans to establish cooperative factories. On one hand, to increase production, and on the other hand, to provide employment for unemployed workers. A plan was drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan requesting the allocation of several enemy and puppet factories, as well as requesting subsidies to help start them. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has approved the allocation of three silk factories to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the China Silk Company, and the Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs to jointly implement the plan, with the China Silk Company as the main entity. The heads of the three agencies have already met to discuss implementation measures and are in consultation with the Economic Department Commissioner's Office to take over the factories designated by the Executive Yuan and are actively preparing for the silk cooperative factory. This large-scale cooperative factory is a first for this city.</p>
<h3>Repairing the Songhu Railway to Be Built to Southern Wusong</h3>
<p>Although the Songhu Railway has been under repair by the authorities since it was demolished by the Japanese, it has not yet been fully opened to traffic. According to sources from the Railway Bureau, the railway will be repaired to Southern Wusong (i.e., Yunzaobang) in the shortest possible time. Once this project is completed, passengers can reach Wusong Town via the Yunzaobang Bridge. The original terminus of the line was Taiwan, but because the land in that area has been requisitioned by the Municipal Land Administration Bureau for the Resource Committee to build a large-scale shipyard, the Railway Bureau will reconsider the terminus of the Songhu Railway. The Songhu Railway has already been repaired to Zhanghuabang, but passenger tickets are still only sold to Gaojingmiao.</p>
<h3>Cosmetics and Perfumes Consumption is Astonishing, Imports of 50 Million Yuan in Eight Months</h3>
<p>According to the Jianghai Customs, imports of cosmetics and perfumes in August this year amounted to 90,037,900 yuan.

The United States ranked first among the exporting countries, with imports totaling 439,020,000 yuan from January to August, followed by the Philippines, the United Kingdom, India, and France.</p>
<h3>More Than 1,000 Personnel Under the Municipal Government Once Held Puppet Positions, Police Account for the Vast Majority, Dismissal Would Affect Public Security</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] This reporter recently asked Mayor Wu when the "Measures for Punishing Civil Servants Who Held Puppet Positions During the War But Were Not Convicted Under the Traitor Statute" would be implemented. According to Mayor Wu, after receiving the relevant order from the Executive Yuan, the Municipal Government immediately instructed all its agencies to investigate. According to statistics from the Personnel Department, more than 1,620 people in the Municipal Government have held puppet positions. There is no doubt that these civil servants should be punished. However, the problem lies in how to continue their current work after such a large number of civil servants are dismissed. According to inquiries by this reporter at the Personnel Department, police officers account for the vast majority of the 1,620 people. The city already feels that there are not enough police officers. If they are dismissed before there is certainty about replacement officers, it will inevitably have a serious impact on public security. Therefore, the mayor believes that the order must be implemented in principle, but in light of the facts, there may be changes to the regulations or the implementation dates.</p>
<h3>Revenue and Expenditure Slight Deficit, Municipal Government Will Not Lay Off Staff</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to Mayor Wu, regarding the issue of Municipal Government layoffs, the previous City Council resolved that, to save expenses, the budget should be reduced by 15%. All existing staff positions exceeding the planned establishment should be eliminated. However, according to the results of an investigation by the Municipal Government Personnel Department, the current number of personnel in the Municipal Government agencies has not reached the planned number in the establishment, and the work of various bureaus and departments is already very intense. Therefore, layoffs seem impossible. Moreover, after including the tax revenues from July, August, and September, the budget for the second half of the year is only slightly insufficient and can be remedied.</p>

<h3>Disaster Victims in Rugao Urgently Awaiting Relief, Hoping for Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Since its organization, the Relief Committee for Disaster Victims in Northern Jiangsu has had the Red Swastika Society Relief Team and the Buddhist Association Burial Team carry out treatment and burial work in the disaster area, which has been very intensive and well-received by all sectors of the local community. Now, the staff of the Committee have moved into Rugao to carry out relief work. The Relief Committee has received a report from the team stating that Rugao has been devastated by the disaster, with widespread destruction. After inspecting the disaster area, bones were found everywhere in the fields. Master Fancheng of the Buddhist Association buried them at any time. Four rooms in the suburbs of the city have been reduced to rubble, and two-thirds of the city's streets have been destroyed. Nine out of ten houses are empty. The remaining people are struggling to survive, unable to afford coffins. Thousands of refugees are still in the city, with little clothing or food, waiting to be fed. Efforts have been made to accommodate them and establish clinics to treat the sick and injured.

The entire journey has been taken care of by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and after arriving in China, they will be received by the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA). After arriving in Shanghai, the CNRRA will find ways to provide ships to send them back to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of Shanghai Pickpocket Gangs (8)</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Black Shops Have Black Hearts, Killing Without Drawing Blood</p>
<p>The number of stolen goods obtained by pickpocket gangs every day is quite considerable. A few days after these stolen goods are stolen, they must be sold to black shops. Moreover, they must be sold to black shops in their respective areas and must not be sold across boundaries or sold privately to individuals or legitimate second-hand stores, so as to prevent leaks and cause trouble for the brothers of the entire gang. In fact, those legitimate second-hand stores are mostly afraid to accept such valuable things from unknown sources, so as to avoid losses after the case is solved.</p>
<p>This kind of black shop specializing in receiving stolen goods has been established in Shanghai for many years. In the concession era, it was a semi-closed business. The people who opened such shops were also qualified "uncles" of the older generation in the gang. These people had experienced pickpocketing and were old enough, and they were also good at accumulating wealth, so they could open shops and start their own businesses. In the eyes of the brothers in the gang, they naturally belonged to the first-class figures of "high age and virtue." However, there are legal and illegal operations in this type of shop. They are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Inn" - that is, a small inn, specializing in providing lodging for poor people and young members of the gang.</p>
<p>(2) "Muffled Kiln" - specializing in collecting waste materials.</p>
<p>(3) "Small Road Kiln" - a second-hand shop specializing in receiving stolen goods.</p>
<p>(4) "Setting Up a Balance" - collecting stolen goods under the guise of collecting second-hand goods. The first two are not worth mentioning. This section specializes in recording the inside stories of the third and fourth types of illegal black shops.</p>
<p>It is naturally a great risk for the older generation to operate this kind of illegal business, so they must make extensive connections. In the "concession" era, they tried their best to win over people in the public sector and contact influential "local bullies" in the area. At the same time, they also had to show "face" to overwhelm those "good-for-nothing" types. Because there are many at least rascals on the streets of Shanghai who specialize in intimidating and extorting money, only "face" can overwhelm them. Because "Small Road Kilns" are illegal operations, the shop address must be absolutely secret. However, for the convenience of trading, they must be opened near the wharves and docks within their sphere of influence, and they must let the brothers in the gang know. Because all the stolen goods of the pickpocket gang are stolen temporarily, of course, there is no fixed form for the size or value. Moreover, the thieves do not know the current market value, so the owner of the black shop can ruthlessly reduce the price and obtain valuable goods at a very low price. The price paid is only about 50% or even 10% of the market price. The benefits are so great that it is shocking.</p>
<p>Each black shop occupies a wharf. Although they talk about friendship on the surface, the boundaries are very strict, and they do not infringe on each other invisibly. Because they all belong to the exploitation class, they routinely refuse to accept small goods sold by gangs from other places. They abide by this rule. If a member of the gang wants to open another black shop to taste the "sweetness" of the "Small Road Kiln," it is tantamount to robbing the profits of the old shop, and a friction or conflict will inevitably occur.</p>
<p>"Setting Up a Balance" is an open black shop, which is no different from an ordinary second-hand shop on the surface, but in fact it specializes in receiving small goods. However, it absolutely does not accept stolen goods from the wharves of the "Running Under" gang, but only receives stolen goods from the "Eating Bad Rice" gang, so as to maintain its boundary with the "Small Road Kiln" black shop, and they never conflict with each other. The convenience of this kind of black shop is that it can be sold publicly immediately after buying it, without having to do business as secretly as the "Small Road Kiln."</p>
<p>The people who open "black shops" must be "black-hearted men." They exploit and rob the brothers who risk stealing in the guise of "thieves robbing thieves," and enjoy the greatest profits. It is extremely hateful. The results of the "little ghosts" hard work fatten this group of black shop owners who kill without drawing blood.</p>
<p>Losing One's Nerve on the Battlefield, It Is Still a Sigh That Talents Are Hard to Find</p>
<p>Although pickpocket gangs are said to be profitable, they must be alert, clever, courageous, and resourceful. Among the many brothers in the gang, only one or two out of ten can be trained by the "uncles" and be competent after entering the world. Especially in the pickpocketing field, only those with advanced skills can be considered "debut." If their skills are poor and they lose their nerve as soon as they enter the stage, they are fundamentally mediocre talents who cannot be presented to the world. Therefore, the "uncles" often sigh that "talents are hard to find." Moreover, no matter how superb the skills are, as long as they have been on the battlefield several times, they will inevitably go to jail due to losing their nerve. The skills they have learned have all become "stinky plates" in prison. "Stinky plates" are most likely to attract the attention of detectives or tram ticket sellers when they reappear on the streets, so their actions lose freedom, and cunning plans cannot be implemented. This is what "stinky plates" worry about most. Therefore, the uncles in the gang like to find one or two "foreign plates" to join the gang, which is tantamount to increasing a new force. The so-called "foreign plate" is a kind of down-and-out young man who is halfway out of the house. He is already in his twenties or thirties. When he was a child, he had never received the "primary education" of "little ghosts" like the brothers in the gang. He hesitates on the streets all day long and is accustomed to seeing the money-making magic of pickpocket gangs, so he cannot help but be happy to see it. So he occasionally tries it once or twice, and only then does he taste the sweetness. However, he is spotted by the "uncle" in the area, who beats him at the beginning. It is also strange that "no discord, no concord." As long as the "foreign plate" is willing to become a disciple and join the gang, the uncle will naturally accept him. Having a "foreign plate" in the gang will not attract the attention of the police when going to the streets, and their actions are much freer. Moreover, because they lack experience, they are fearless and especially bold. The so-called "newborn calves are not afraid of tigers." After the uncle teaches them the gang rules and daily homework, it is not difficult for them to become a "good talent." However, they still inevitably become a "stinky plate" after their debut, which is the most regrettable thing.</p>
<p>Pickpocket gangs are very worried about going to jail. What they fear most is being caught on the spot by passers-by after losing their nerve, or when there is nowhere to escape in the tram, the crowd will beat them with their fists and feet, and everyone will irresponsibly beat them up. After the beating, they will either disperse or hand them over to the police. Regardless of the pain of the physical punishment suffered on the spot, they are often beaten by the crowd into internal injuries, often losing their front teeth, spitting blood on the spot, and breaking their ribs, all of which can easily cause fatal injuries. "A pickpocket named Zhang Agou was beaten to death" is not a big deal in the news of this city. People will also scold him for "bringing it upon himself."</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Increase Prices, Electricity Allowed to Be Adjusted First, Tramway Not Yet Considered</h3>
<p>It has recently been rumored that public utilities in this city will increase prices simultaneously starting next month. This will not only increase the burden on citizens, but also stimulate general prices, which is of great importance to people's livelihoods. Yesterday, a reporter from the East China News Agency specifically asked Mr. Zhao Zengting, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, about this issue. Mr. Zhao's key answers are as follows: (1) Due to the high cost of electricity in this city and the huge expenses, the company has been losing money heavily every month. The company has repeatedly stated its business difficulties and requested that the electricity price be adjusted appropriately. The Bureau has sent personnel to investigate in detail, and the statements are found to be true. It has been decided to approve the company to adjust prices first. (2) The British and French tramway companies have requested to change the fare, but the standard of the increase has not yet been considered. (3) Public buses will maintain the lowest possible cost due to the high cost of fuel. (4) The prices of tap water and telephones need to be carefully studied and decided.</p>
<h3>Inventory Team Completes Work, Compiles General Report</h3>
<p>After the declaration of the end of the takeover work inventory team, there were still some outstanding cases that needed to be further investigated. The inventory team's inventory committee members came to Shanghai to conduct investigations. It is now learned that a general report on the inventory work has been compiled and is expected to be carried to the Central Government by the head of the team, Zhang Zhiben, in the near future. The contents of the report have been revised several times and are slightly different from what was previously reported. The table of contents is divided into seven points as follows: (1) General overview, (2) Overview of the organization of this group, (3) Plans and handling of affairs of this group, (4) Inventory of takeover work, (5) Inventory of handling work, (6) Cases of secret reports from the people regarding the takeover, (7) Conclusion of the work of this group and its review.</p>
<h3>Trolleybus Line 20 Renamed and Restored</h3>
<p>In order to increase transportation facilities, the British tramway company has restored part of trolleybus line 20, which had been suspended before.

It started operating yesterday, which is convenient for the citizens.</p>
<h3>What Boldness! Stole a Check, Went to Cash It in Person, Finally Arrested by the Victim's Police Report</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhu Jinkui, a 24-year-old from Zhenjiang, lives at 26 Madrid Road, Ma Huo Road. He usually makes a living by setting up a book stall. At around 9:00 AM on the 25th, Zhu had not yet gotten up when two thugs suddenly appeared. One of them held a pistol and pointed it at Zhu's mother, accusing her of smoking opium. Zhu denied it and was slapped twice. The other bandit arbitrarily searched the tin box and stole 360,000 yuan in legal tender and a check for 583,000 yuan issued by the Shenyuanxiang Women's Shoe Shop in Xiaohuayuan, Guangxi Road. Before leaving, they also stole the gold ring on Zhu's hand. The thief was deeply afraid that the check could not be cashed, so he forced Zhu to accompany him to the Shenyuanxiang Shoe Shop to confirm the check. It turned out that the check was a remittance from the mainland to Shanghai. According to the person in charge of Shenyuanxiang, it should be cashed here on the 27th. At the time, Zhu did not go to the police station to request an arrest, but expected that the bandits would go to collect the money at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Zhu then instructed his brother, Helin, to wait at the Shenyuanxiang Shoe Shop. Before long, the two bandits did arrive. The shop first paid them 300,000 yuan, and the remaining amount was scheduled to be paid off today. When the bandits left with the money, Helin followed behind them. At the intersection of Guangxi Road and Hankou Road, he reported to the traffic police to arrest them and brought them to the Lao Zha Police Station. According to their confessions, one was Wang Xinqi, 23 years old, and the other was Lei Zhenhua, 26 years old, both from Wuxi. Wang used to be a member of the self-defense corps in his hometown and is now unemployed, reduced to a bandit. Afterwards, according to their confessions, the police continued to capture the prostitute Qiao Linchu, and seized two pistols and eleven bullets at Qiao's residence, 202 Qinghe Hotel. The case is currently under investigation.</p>

<h3>A Quarrel Followed by Violence: Scissors Violently Stab Husband</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Dai Qiguo from Tongzhou, aged forty, residing at No. 5, Lane 685, East Changzhi Road (formerly East Seward Road) in eastern Shanghai, previously worked as a laborer in Taicang. He is currently employed by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Shanghai. His wife, Ms. Lin, thirty-three years old, is moderately attractive, but the couple is not harmonious and often quarrel. Recently, the situation has worsened. Yesterday morning, around four o'clock, Dai and Ms. Lin had another argument, which escalated into violence. Unexpectedly, Ms. Lin was unusually fierce. She grabbed a large pair of tailoring scissors from the cabinet and stabbed Dai in the right leg twice, each wound about an inch deep. Blood gushed out immediately, splattering the bedclothes. Dai cried out for help, and neighbors, hearing the noise, got up and saw Dai lying in a pool of blood on the bed, his injuries severe. The sub-landlord, Miao Ercai, reported the incident to the Tilanqiao Police Station. The police dispatched officers to investigate, arrested the assailant, Ms. Lin, along with the recovered scissors, and took them to the station for interrogation. At the same time, they urgently summoned an ambulance to rush the injured Dai to Gongji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Dai's two wounds on his right thigh had severed blood vessels, and he had lost too much blood, which could be life-threatening. It was later learned that Ms. Lin's behavior had been improper recently, and she had an affair. The cause of the attack was a quarrel, but the police are investigating whether there were other underlying reasons.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Commodity Prices: Then and Now</h3>
<p>Special Article from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, commodity prices have soared out of control, rising daily without any sign of stopping. The cost of living index for September of this year was 496,739.70, using 1936 as the base year of 100. This means that prices have increased nearly 5,000 times in the past ten years. Currently, one yuan of legal tender is worth less than two li of what it was before the war. Living with such high prices is oppressive for everyone, and most people are struggling on the brink of death.</p>
<p>How did this unprecedented surge in commodity prices come about? During the First World War, the whole world experienced high commodity prices, but China's commodity prices only increased by 20% from the beginning to the end of the war, while the United States increased by more than 100%. However, during this war, China's situation was different from the last time, encountering an unprecedented situation. There was an urgent need for materials, which created this straight-line upward surge in commodity prices.</p>
<p>After Shanghai became an "isolated island," the population not only did not decrease but gradually increased. The occupied areas expanded daily, and people could not bear the oppression. They all considered the isolated island a haven of peace and came one after another. With a large population, consumption naturally increased. After the war, transportation was not smooth, and goods could not come in a steady stream. Under the principle of supply and demand not matching, a situation of "things are valued when they are scarce" naturally arose. As for currency inflation and foreign tightening, these are all factors that form the commodity price problem, but let's leave that for the experts to analyze.</p>
<p>Everything Can Be Hoarded, Nothing Isn't Speculated On: A Memory of a Dark Period</p>
<p>The soaring of commodity prices is like "a wind blowing through an empty cave." We only see the prices in stores changing every three days or five days. We only hear the rice dealers in the alleys arbitrarily adding to the rice price two hundred, three hundred, three thousand, five thousand, but this is not the main reason for promoting the soaring of commodity prices. Shanghai is a speculative market. After the war, many high-ranking refugees brought considerable funds with them. After the outbreak of the European war, wealthy businessmen from Hong Kong and Macau brought even more huge sums of money to Shanghai. The funds in the Shanghai market were particularly abundant, without a proper outlet. Everyone tended to speculate. In addition to foreign exchange, sharks' fins, cotton yarn, etc., attention was also shifted to goods, which were more reliable than sharks' fins and foreign exchange. At first, it was only rice, flour, grains, bean oil, etc. Later, the financial industry relaxed its lending for these most reliable goods as much as possible, making those who engaged in hoarding stronger and more powerful, and they did everything they could to monopolize and manipulate the market. Matches, soap, cigarettes, etc. were all targets of hoarding. It is true that everything can be hoarded, and nothing isn't speculated on.</p>
<p>After the trend of hoarding became popular, the entire Shanghai society became a large casino. All funds were used to hoard goods for profit, forming a large organization. In this great hoarding organization, there were three types of people: those who hid behind the scenes of the political arena, relying on their collusion with political connections and using huge financial resources to buy goods; these were the hoarders with special power. The silver and money industry absorbed cash and used other people's capital to make their own windfall profits, which was also a broad road to hoarding. These were the hoarders in the financial industry. Opening factories was supposed to supply production, and opening stores was supposed to distribute consumption, but factories had no output, stores did no business, and the factories and stores were used as a cover to engage in hoarding; these were the hoarders in industry and commerce. Other small hoarders who were "kicking the ball" were not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Price Controls and the Black Market</p>
<p>Once the trend of hoarding started, everyone held the view that manufacturing was not as good as selling, and selling was not as good as hoarding. The goods on the market were completely monopolized by the hoarders. With fewer goods, prices naturally soared, with a momentum of reaching new heights. The pockets of the profiteers were indeed full, but who thought about how many people were struggling on the brink of death due to high commodity prices! This "gulf" divided the paradise and hell of the isolated island.</p>
<p>When commodity prices soared, the former concession authorities repeatedly issued orders to ban them, established a commodity price stabilization committee, and announced the prices of major commodities. The policy of adopting official fixed prices was aimed at curbing the rise in commodity prices, but the result was that the announced prices were out of sync with the actual prices, and commodities were hidden away because of the price controls. Goods disappeared from the market, and those who needed them had to seek them in the black market. Although the authorities strictly controlled them, transactions were established as long as one side was willing to sell and the other side was willing to buy. If the buyer did not pay this price, they would not be able to buy what they wanted. Price controls led to the emergence of the black market, and the black market raised commodity prices, a cycle that continued endlessly.</p>
<p>Price controls and the black market thus launched a fierce struggle. Although the former concession authorities punished and even sealed up the illegal shops, it was ineffective, and it was only the small merchants who suffered. As for the large hoarders who manipulated the market, they had reliable backers, usable financial resources, and even mysterious and unpredictable methods. Although under strict control, they could not stop the rise in commodity prices.</p>
<p>Rationed Rice</p>
<p>The reason why the rising tide of commodity prices could not be stopped was that the administrative authorities could not grasp the materials. To control commodity prices, it is necessary to control materials first. Therefore, the former Public Works Department established a Material Control Office to investigate the goods stored in the warehouses. On the one hand, it tried to increase supply and purchase goods, and directly distributed them to consumers. This method seemed more active than price controls.</p>
<p>A certain rice store was going to sell flat-price rice, and a certain alley was going to ration bean oil. These good news were comforting enough for the citizens. Although each person only had a few sheng of rice and a few liang of oil, it was better than nothing. So, supporting the old and leading the young, they took their sacks and baskets and gathered in front of the store, forming a "long snake array." Although the store doors did not open until six or seven o'clock in the morning, some people had already been waiting there since eight or nine o'clock the night before, as if they were going to the temple to catch the "first incense." After finally waiting for the door to open, the crowd started another round of commotion. Originally, when doing business, it was possible to distribute one by one, but it was always me squeezing you and you squeezing me. The sedan chair was trampled off, things were squeezed away, and even children were injured and pregnant women had miscarriages. This scene was tense and tragic enough.</p>
<p>Buying rationed goods was so difficult, waiting for most of the night, squeezing in the crowd for at least a few hours, and the rice obtained was only enough for a bowl of porridge, and most of it was red rice and brown rice, plus some sand and stones. The citizens were disappointed with the rationing. As a result, it not only had no effect but also fueled the rampant black market, making people even more insecure.</p>
<p>At the same time, these very small amounts of rationed goods could not be distributed on time and in quantity, because they first had to meet the large amounts of supplies for the enemy army, and then supply the various demands of the traitors and puppets, so the source was still not smooth. When the concession existed, the four suburbs were controlled by the enemy and puppets. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the lack of materials became even more serious. Initially, the rationed items were rice, salt, oil, and other important daily necessities, and gradually even soap, matches, and cigarettes were included in the rationing list, but this only indicated that the acquisition of materials was more difficult, and the people did not benefit from the increase in the number of rationed items.</p>
<p>Commodity Prices Before the War</p>
<p>The current huge amount of living expenses was transformed in the past eight years. Let's not talk about hundreds of years ago or decades ago. Just comparing the commodity prices before the war with the current prices is already worlds apart. The former Public Works Department's Health Department used to investigate the prices of food in the former International Settlement on a daily basis for comparison. Here is a list of the prices of several important foods:</p>
<p>Item Unit Price</p>
<p>Steak Pound 0.47</p>
<p>Lean Beef Pound 0.98</p>
<p>Yellow Croaker Pound 0.60</p>
<p>Pork Pound 0.49</p>
<p>Ham (Raw) Pound 0.96</p>
<p>Bacon Pound 0.65</p>
<p>Live Chicken Pound 0.56</p>
<p>Cabbage Pound 0.07</p>
<p>Potato Pound 0.04</p>
<p>Orange Each 0.17</p>
<p>Lemon Each 0.21</p>
<p>From the above table, although there is only a difference of ten years, the soaring of commodity prices cannot be measured in distance.</p>
<p>The Rising Tide of Commodity Prices Did Not End with the End of the War</p>
<p>During the war, due to transportation difficulties and the lack of materials, and Shanghai's special situation, the prices rose like crazy, which can be explained. Everyone hoped that victory would come soon, and the pressure of commodity prices could be lifted. The firecrackers of victory finally resounded throughout Shanghai, but the rising tide of commodity prices did not end with the war and continued its consistent style: rise! rise! rise!</p>
<p>In Shanghai in the early days of victory, commodity prices did fall. However, people from Chongqing, upon arriving in Shanghai and seeing that things in Shanghai were much cheaper than in Chongqing and Kunming, bought them one after another. Merchants, seeing that there was profit to be made, immediately changed their prices again. The commodity prices, which had taken a slight break, continued to rise as a result. The workers' cost of living index in September of the 34th year of the Republic of China was 29,923.62, rising to 44,142.43 in October, an increase of 50%. In November, it rose to 102,190.83, more than doubling compared to October. The cost of living index for September of this year was 496,739.70, an increase of more than 17 times compared to a year ago. How can one control these crazy commodity prices?</p>
<p>Rice is the most important thing for people's livelihood. In September of last year, each shi (approximately 133 pounds) cost about 6,000 yuan, and then rose to 8,000, 9,000. Once the Lunar New Year passed, it had already broken through 10,000 yuan. Everyone was worried about food again. In March of this year, the Grain Administration released 200 million yuan of rice purchase loans to encourage rice merchants to go to the producing areas to purchase rice in order to enrich Shanghai's food supply, so that rice prices could naturally fall. Who knew that before the loans were released, the Grain Administration thought it was a good deal, but after the loans were released, the rice merchants did not go to the producing areas to buy rice, but purchased it on the Shanghai market with the loans, causing rice prices to rise higher and higher. The grain loans fueled the rise in rice prices, and finally it was exposed, which was the grain loan bribery case that caused a sensation for a while.</p>
<p>Once food prices rose, other goods had an excuse to raise their prices. In addition, labor strikes occurred one after another, and terms such as unified distribution and rationing appeared in Shanghai again.</p>
<h3>How Are the Salary and Wage Indices Compiled?</h3>
<p>Currently, there are two types of cost of living indices seen in Shanghai, apart from the one for Westerners: one is the workers' cost of living index, and the other is the employees' cost of living index. The workers' cost of living index was compiled the earliest, in 1929, by the former Social Affairs Bureau, using the "household survey method." In the five districts of east, west, south, north, and Pudong, 500 worker families were selected to keep daily records. The selection criteria were: (1) families of three to six people, (2) monthly income of 20 to 60 yuan. At that time, only 305 families kept records for a full twelve months, for a total of 3,660 account books. The items included in the index were based on calculations from these account books, totaling 60 items, including 31 food items, 11 clothing items, 3 rent items, 8 fuel items, and 7 miscellaneous items. According to the compilers, the selection of "samples" was quite difficult due to the large number of items and the different qualities. At the same time, attention was also paid to the weight of each item. For example, rice is heavier than sugar. In terms of investigating commodity prices: (1) there were five regions: East District, South District, West District, North District, and Pudong District. According to the size of the region and the number of workers, a number of representative shops were selected in each district. (2) In terms of time, prices that did not change much were investigated once a month on the 15th, and prices that changed more frequently were investigated once a week to calculate the average price of a target. (3) The quality was kept consistent. If there was a standard brand name, the standard brand name was used; otherwise, comparison was used. The calculation formula used was a type of "weighted aggregate formula." The base period was adopted as 1926, the reason being that the economic situation in that year was stable and there were no special changes, and it was also convenient to compare with foreign indices.</p>
<p>Employees' Index</p>
<p>The employees' cost of living index was created in 1941 by the former Public Works Department's Industrial and Social Affairs Department. Initially, 500 employee families were also sought to record detailed accounts of income and expenses, with three months set from October 12 to December 31. At that time, a total of 1,038 families responded, of which 167 families stopped recording at any time, 430 families' accounts were not suitable for use, and the remaining 441 families completed the recording in accordance with the prescribed method. Because it was urgent to use, a temporary index was compiled based on the account books of 100 families first. The accounting families were (1) limited to the Chinese employee class in the city, and the head of the family was not limited to the industry, but peasants, workers, or those who established their own businesses were not suitable for selection. (2) Self-reliant families who did not rely on ancestral property income or parental subsidies for daily living expenses. (3) The salary and other income of the head of the family was limited to 500 to 1,500 yuan in legal tender per month, and those whose salary was in foreign currency were not suitable for selection. (4) The family population, including husband and wife, children, and dependents, was limited to no more than ten people. Those who lived in and paid for accommodation, as well as servants, were not included. (5) The family residence was limited to those who lived in cargo houses, and those who owned their own houses or lived in the service place and did not need to pay rent were not suitable for selection. (6) The family meals were limited to those who prepared their own meals or hired servants to cook, and those who contracted with cooks or restaurants were not suitable for selection. Those who dined out due to work or study were not limited to this. According to the survey at that time, there were 224 students in 100 families, accounting for 33.94% of the family members. There were 108 male employees and 13 female employees, totaling 121 people, accounting for 18.33%. Only 6 wives, 4 sons, and 3 daughters were employed. The income of children did not supplement household expenses, so one employed person had to bear the living expenses of more than five people, including servants. The occupations of these 100 families are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Manufacturing Industry Male 11 people</p>
<p>Transportation Male 16 people Female 1 person</p>
<p>Freelance Male 2 people</p>
<p>Wholesale Industry Male 11 people</p>
<p>Education Male 13 people Female 7 people</p>
<p>Public Utilities Male 15 people</p>
<p>Administrative Agency Male 23 people</p>
<p>Finance and Banking Male 10 people Female 2 people</p>
<p>Retail Industry Male 3 people</p>
<p>Church Male 4 people</p>
<p>Total Male 108 people Female 13 people</p>
<p>According to the calculations at that time, the average income per family per month was 688.38 yuan, and the expenditure was 883.78 yuan. After offsetting income and expenditure, there was a shortfall of 274.08 yuan. As for the compilation method, it was roughly the same as the workers' cost of living.</p>
<h3>Beyond Comparison: An Old Account: Memoirs of the Late Ming and Early Qing Dynasties</h3>
<p>The soaring of commodity prices in Shanghai is not a recent special situation, but has been around for a long time. However, the recent surge in prices is truly alarming. Comparing it with the commodity prices of the past decades, it is hard to believe.</p>
<p>In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the price of rice was as follows: At the end of the Chongzhen reign, Shanghai experienced years of drought, and the price of rice rose to one tael of silver per shi (in the Qing system, one tael was equivalent to 700 copper coins), which was an unprecedentedly high price. Hungry people were everywhere, running around reporting the emergency. By the sixth year of the Shunzhi reign, there was a great harvest in the autumn, and grain and rice were only worth 1.2 taels per shi. Japonica rice was cheap at 900 cash. When the Kangxi Emperor ascended the throne, the country was at peace, and the five grains were abundant. The price of rice dropped to 200 cash per shi, causing a good harvest to hurt farmers. Many wealthy families, despite having abundant millet, could not afford the land tax they had to pay. In order to pay taxes, they abandoned it and fled. This is not a joke, but a fact.</p>
<p>The price of wheat in the early Qing Dynasty was also the cheapest during the Kangxi period. When the new wheat was first harvested, the officials began to strictly pursue the completion of the grain payment. Because farmers urgently needed to sell wheat for silver to pay to the national treasury, they painfully sold it cheaply, only 300 to 400 cash per shi. In the ninth year of Kangxi, wheat was 700 cash per shi, and He wheat was 600 cash per shi, which was already waiting for a good price to sell.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Cotton and Cloth: Shanghai began to cultivate cotton as early as the end of the Song Dynasty, on a scale equivalent to rice fields. In the early years of the Chongzhen reign, the price of cotton was 4 to 5 taels of silver per dan (approximately 100 pounds). Later, due to the rise of roaming bandits, it could not be transported out, and gradually went downstream. By the third year of the Shunzhi reign, it fell to 500 to 600 cash per dan. The most expensive time was in the eighth year of the Shunzhi reign, at 9 taels per dan. But usually, a value of about 3 taels was considered very expensive. As for the market price of cloth, it was roughly 200 to 300 cash per tael of silver.</p>
<p>The Price of Tofu and Meat: Soybeans used to be cheaper than rice, with one shi of beans worth seven dou of rice. In the fourteenth year of Chongzhen, Shanghai experienced a severe drought, with more beans than rice. One shi of rice could be exchanged for two shi of beans. In the ninth year of Shunzhi, there was more rice than beans, with each shi priced at 900 cash, while the price of beans was worth 1.8 taels. In the early years of Kangxi, high-quality soybeans were worth 500 cash per shi, and the expensive ones were only between 500 and 600 cash. Cheap beans, made into tofu, were naturally enough to burn two or three large bowls for one copper coin.</p>
<p>Pork and Salt and Sugar</p>
<p>The market price of pork in Shanghai was often around 20 cash per tael of silver. When the Qing army went south, the price rose to 1.2 taels per catty (approximately 1.3 pounds) amidst the chaos of war. Until the Shunzhi era, it never recovered to the original price of the late Ming Dynasty. It was not until the twelfth year of Kangxi that it fell to 25 cash per catty again, and then it was often around 30 cash. When the Shanghai citizens, who had not tasted meat for three months, heard this, they truly wished they had been born a hundred years earlier.</p>
<p>Salt and Sugar: Shanghai borders the river and the sea, and is a salt-producing area. During the Chongzhen reign, the price of salt was as cheap as 150 to 160 cash per dan. During the Shunzhi reign, it was 10 cash per catty of silver. In April of the eighth year of Shunzhi, it was as high as 600 to 700 cash per catty of silver due to a major flood, which was the highest record for the price of salt in Shanghai in the early Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>As for the price of sugar in Shanghai, in the late Ming Dynasty, high-quality white cane sugar was worth 30 to 40 cash per catty. During the Shunzhi reign, the source of sugar was blocked due to the many incidents on the sea frontier, and it was worth 400 cash per catty. It was not until the middle of the Kangxi reign that the old price of sugar was restored. In the twentieth year of Kangxi, white sugar was worth 30 cash per catty, and brown sugar was as cheap as 10 cash. In the twenty-fifth year of Kangxi, it fell further to 20 cash per catty.</p>
<p>The Life of Westerners in Shanghai When It Was First Opened</p>
<p>The market prices of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties are too far away from the current life. Let's take a look at the situation when Shanghai was first opened. At that time, silver dollars had flowed into China. The commonly used silver dollar was the Spanish silver dollar, commonly known as Benyang, which was equivalent to 1,400 to 1,500 copper coins each. The "North China Herald" (predecessor of the "North China Daily News") on September 14, 1850, published the prices of various goods in Westerners' food shops, which shows how low the commodity prices were at that time, which Shanghai citizens today cannot imagine:</p>
<p>Fresh Beef 14 pounds per dollar</p>
<p>Fresh Mutton 12 pounds per dollar</p>
<p>Fresh Pork 120 cash per catty</p>
<p>Lard 130 cash per catty</p>
<p>Chicken 95 cash per catty</p>
<p>Duck 110 cash per catty</p>
<p>Eggs 6 cash each</p>
<p>Flour 24 cash per catty</p>
<p>Rock Sugar 120 cash per catty</p>
<p>Granulated Sugar 56 cash per catty</p>
<p>Sweet Potatoes 18 cash per catty</p>
<p>The prices listed in the above table are already more expensive than those purchased by ordinary Chinese people, but now it seems that they are really incredibly cheap.</p>
<p>However, although the cost of living was low at that time, life was still not easy. At that time, a Westerner named Lan wrote a book called "Shanghai Social Talks," saying that spending 400 pounds in Shanghai was not as comfortable as spending 100 pounds in England. At that time, the salary of a coolie was 4 yuan per month, while a trained "boy" required 6 yuan. The silver dollars at this time were already Mexican silver dollars. According to Lan's words, I don't know how low the living standards were in the British Isles at that time.</p>
<h3>A Dinner Seventy Years Ago</h3>
<p>"A rich man's dinner is a poor man's half-year's food." How have the prices of banquets, which are generally considered luxurious, changed over the years? During the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns, the most exquisite banquet was a whole roast suckling pig banquet, with a price of 12,000 cash per table. The next best was a sixteen-dish banquet, eight large and eight small bird's nest dishes, priced at 5,600 cash. If the sixteen dishes were not used and replaced with twelve-dish four-appetizer plates, it would only cost 5,000 cash. The value of a shark fin banquet was 4,200 cash, with twelve dishes, six large, six small, and four desserts. A sea cucumber banquet also had twelve dishes, four large, four small, and four desserts, and the price was only 2,400 cash. As for the food for the followers and servants, each table had six large bowls and only cost 1,200 cash.</p>
<p>In the eleventh year of Tongzhi, Ye, the magistrate of Shanghai, held a 70th birthday celebration for his mother, and the banquets he held included two suckling pig banquets, thirteen shark fin banquets, and twelve secondary shark fin banquets. 170 catties of Shaoxing wine, 206 bowls of top-grade noodles, 214 bowls of medium-grade noodles, and 1,000 bowls of low-grade noodles, cost a total of 266 silver dollars and 87,898 cash. It is estimated that it is not enough to eat a customer's meal or breakfast now.</p>
<p>As for daily meals, the food expenses in the yamen (government office) at that time were stipulated as 400 cash per day for the magistrate, and the rest were divided into three levels: upper, middle, and lower. The upper and middle levels were 80 cash per person per day, and the lower level was 60 cash per day. Temporary workers, such as weeding and sweeping garbage, only had 50 cash per day. But at that time, everyone could live comfortably, which is enviable to hear.</p>

<h3>Old Paper Pile: Several Pages of Food Bills</h3>
<p>In some old books, I found a few pages of food bills, dating back forty or fifty years. Seeing the prices at that time, I cannot help but feel the changes between the past and the present. 1. One page from the 27th year of the Guangxu reign: rice was 1,200 cash per shi (unit of dry measure), flour was 14 cash per jin (unit of weight), firewood was 70 cash per 100 jin, meat was 56 cash per jin, eggs were 4 cash each (2 for 7 cash), sugar was 24 cash per jin, wine was 18 cash per jin, and cloth shoes were 80 cash per pair. Hiring a rickshaw typically cost from 12 or 13 cash to 40 or 50 cash; from Wuma Road to Fanwang Ferry, it was 100+ cash. From Ximen to Xujiahui, it was only 60 cash. In large teahouses like Hua Zonghui and Wanhua Lou, a bowl of tea for two people was only 28 cash. Noodles were 16 cash per bowl, steamed buns were 7 cash each; three or four people drinking tea would spend 200 cash, and spending 300 or 400 cash meant drinking wine and ordering dishes.</p>
<p>2. One page from the first year of the Xuantong reign: rice was 2 yuan per shi, firewood was 100 cash per 100 jin, pork was 60 cash per jin, oil was 56 cash per jin, soy sauce was 64 cash per jin, eggs were 5 cash each, chicken was 60 cash per jin, vegetables were 150 cash per dan (unit of weight), sedan chair rides were 400 cash each (approximately 10 li), haircuts were 50 cash each, and city houses rented for 3 yuan per month.</p>
<p>After reading these two pages of old accounts, comparing the present with the past, one cannot help but feel like being in two different worlds. At that time, a family of four or five could live comfortably on a monthly income of 20 yuan. In the mid-Guangxu period, each silver dollar could be exchanged for less than 1,000 cash; even during the Xuantong period, it was only 1,100 cash. Twenty yuan could be exchanged for about 20,000 cash. Considering the most important expenses for daily life, food and housing, only 4,000 or 5,000 cash were needed, leaving 15,000 or 16,000 cash for other expenses, which was enough to satisfy life's needs. If one was slightly frugal, one could even save a little each month.</p>
<h3>Song of Hard Living: How Much Can Ordinary People Earn? How Will the Old, Weak, and Disabled Survive?</h3>
<p>In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sheng Chengxuan of Nanhuashan, feeling the high prices and difficult living conditions, wrote a "Song of Hard Living." But today's prices cannot be measured by miles and leagues. The lyrics say:</p>
<p>"Hard to make a living, hard to make a living, it's truly sigh-inducing to talk about. White rice is eleven yuan per hundred jin, brown rice is nine and a half jin per yuan, coarse firewood is twenty cash per jin, even Mao firewood costs twelve or thirteen. A dime buys a jin of salt, nine cents buys six liang of oil, Shaoxing wine is a dime per jin, two pieces of tofu cost three copper plates. One thousand cash buys a jin of meat, seven hundred cash buys a jin of fish, salted fish costs two dimes per jin, the price of white fish is up to the seller, sixty cash buys a duck egg, seventy cash buys a goose egg, chicken prices suddenly became unusually expensive last year. Fifty is the minimum for buying wheat flour, thirty is the minimum for buying sugar sauce, fried dough sticks, sesame cakes, and stinky tofu all cost thirty cash each. Green vegetables, cucumbers, and mung bean sprouts can barely be stir-fried for a hundred cash, turnips and mustard greens are cheap in winter, but a hundred jin costs more than two yuan. Thirty cash buys a shoulder of water, one hundred and twenty cash buys a jin of charcoal, tea prices depend on the quality, five dimes a jin for leaves with stems. Coarse cloth costs three hundred cash per foot, foreign cloth costs five thousand cash per zhang, a cotton quilt costs six yuan, a cotton mosquito net costs five yuan, a straw mat costs two thousand cash, a felt blanket costs ten thousand cash. A box of matches costs twenty cash, a box of kerosene costs more than four yuan. No matter what piece of clothing, you need at least one yuan to get it. These are all daily necessities, and prices are not negotiable, compared to other places, it's considered cheap, but compared to the late Qing Dynasty, it's ten times as much. One yuan is worth three thousand cash, but it can only be exchanged for three hundred copper coins, an ordinary household of five people cannot afford dishes for one yuan a day, how much can ordinary people earn in a year? How will the old, weak, and disabled survive? This alone shows how hard it is to make a living, not to mention the burden of taxes, donations, and social engagements, hard to make a living, hard to make a living!"</p>
<h3>Social Services: Advocating Infant Welfare, Banking Sector Donates Generously</h3>
<p>Infant Health and Welfare Institute is appealing to all sectors for donations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Infant Health and Welfare Institute is a newly established health and welfare organization in China. Due to limited funding and facilities, its operations have been restricted. Since Mr. Pan Gongzhan took office as chairman, he has been very interested in this kind of health and welfare work and has given it great enthusiasm. Mr. Pan asked the banks to raise funds: the Central Bank pledged 50 million yuan, the China Farmers' Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau pledged 10 million yuan each, and the Seventh District Machine and Occupational Guild pledged 50 million yuan. Local dignitaries Liu Hongsheng, Xu Ji _, Luo Qinghua, Xi Yushu, Qian Jianqiu, and Shui Xiangyun were divided into groups to solicit donations, and Chairman Pan invited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to serve as the general leader, coordinating all matters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday, Mr. Yang Fusheng of the Heming Shoe and Hat Store in this city sent a donation of 1 million yuan, which has been forwarded to the institute. As for other donations, they have not yet been settled and will be announced later. It is still hoped that all sectors will actively contribute and jointly participate in this benevolent cause. Mr. Yang's original letter said: "Chairman Pan Gongzhan: The establishment of the Infant Health and Welfare Institute aims to promote the health of children and lay the foundation for national construction. The merit lies in serving the people, and the concern lies in protecting infants. I deeply admire what I heard the other day and dare not fail to follow suit in order to see its early success. I respectfully offer a check for one million yuan, and I pray that you will accept it. I am ashamed of being but a drop in the ocean, but I hope to add my mite to the effort. Please consider it carefully. I respectfully wish you success. From Yang Fusheng's hand (attached a check for one million national currency)."</p>
<h3>Seeking Information</h3>

<h3>After Reorganization of Yarn Allocation Agency, Allocation Price is Lower, Allocation Quantity will Increase, Qualifications are Strictly Checked, and Money Supply is Tightened</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] In recent days, the weather has been warm and cloth sales have been sluggish. In addition, the money supply is tight and interest rates are high. Cloth market prices have fallen slightly by 20-30%. However, yarn prices remain firm and have fallen very little. The reason for this is that the production of cotton yarn is inherently insufficient, and the _ operated yarn factories are financially strong and do not need to reduce prices for sales. Although the allocated prices by Fangjian are low, the allocated quantity of yarn is very small. Moreover, the cotton yarn reproduction industry has very little yarn in stock on weekdays. Since work cannot be stopped, raw materials must be replenished at any time. Therefore, yarn prices have always been firm, especially for fine counts. Since Mayor Wu concurrently serves as the director of the Textile Industry Management Committee, the joint yarn allocation system has been improved. People's hearts have calmed down slightly. Recently, the Six District Cotton Textile Association and the Cotton Yarn Reproduction Industry Associations are actively deploying, and allocations will begin today.</p>
<p>Lower Allocation Price</p>
<p>The allocation price, based on 20 counts as the standard, is 1.75 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous period. It is heard that the amount proposed by the Six District Cotton Textile Association was not just this number. Subsequently, after Mayor Wu approved the above, it was lower than the 1.8 million proposed by a person in charge of the reproduction industry at the municipal meeting. Mayor Wu said that yarn prices must be lowered, but he advocated doing so gradually. Therefore, the allocation price for the next period may be reduced. According to people in the yarn factory industry, the current cost of cotton yarn is around 1.4 million for small factories and lower for large factories. If the report that President Song approved the continued allocation of foreign exchange to purchase foreign cotton is true, then yarn prices could be reduced again.</p>
<p>Allocation Quantity Standard</p>
<p>The total amount of yarn allocated for this period is 12,004.5 pieces, including 7,816.5 pieces for the dyeing and weaving industry, 1,902 pieces for knitting, 1,015 pieces for underwear, 720.5 pieces for towels and blankets, 460.5 pieces for handmade cotton weaving, and 90 pieces for handkerchiefs. This is based on Mayor Wu's calculation of 60% of the total amount of yarn needed as declared by the reproduction industry associations, allocating one-half of that amount as stated above to meet the sales volume for this half month. At a meeting convened by the municipal government last week, Mayor Wu solicited opinions from various reproduction industries. A person in charge stated on the spot that this amount was inherently insufficient, but due to the recent warm weather, sluggish sales, and tight money supply, 60% should be sufficient, and added that some companies may not be able to receive all of it. According to the yarn allocation committee of the cotton yarn reproduction industry associations, all industries need yarn of various counts. Their declaration books were clearly classified. The above allocation quantity is based on a composite standard of 20 counts. In reality, there should be multiple counts.</p>
<p>Allocation Procedures</p>
<p>It is heard that the yarn allocated by the Textile Management Committee to the various reproduction industry associations will be issued in a master list yesterday afternoon, which will be handed over to the joint committee of the allocated industries, and then distributed to the six associations, which will allocate them to each member based on the number previously declared and in the same proportion. The reproduction industry allocation committee is already planning this work. According to the person in charge, it will be difficult to allocate if the counts from the Textile Management Committee are not uniform. Factories that urgently need yarn can only distribute it proportionally based on the counts received. Member factories that actually need yarn but have not reported to the association for submission to the Textile Management Committee will not be able to participate in the allocation this period. However, it is heard that the associations are collecting continued declarations so that they can be added in the next period. Many of the knitting and dyeing industries did not participate this time. At a board meeting of the knitting industry association the night before, it caused criticism from non-reporting members. After the person in charge of the association explained with understanding, they were understood. The canvas industry is also one of the cotton yarn reproduction industries. This time, because it did not report in time, it did not participate at all. The person in charge of the Textile Management Committee stated that there was no way to help this period, but it can be added in the next period. Therefore, the allocation quantity for the next period can often be increased.</p>
<p>Qualification Review</p>
<p>The yarn allocation committee organized by the cotton yarn reproduction industry associations is the joint organization required when the Textile Management Committee issues documents. As for the internal affairs of each industry, they are still managed by each industry itself. However, a person in charge advocated organizing a joint investigation team so that each industry could supervise each other. The personnel of the investigation team will be as many as dozens of people. It is also heard that Mayor Wu strictly forbade resale of yarn this time. The important members of the yarn allocation committee also consider this to be a work that cannot be relaxed. They will contact the yarn market to gather information for investigation. As for the internal affairs of each industry, they have already been ordered by the Textile Management Committee to establish a review team to re-examine the original declaration books. It is expected that many factories will have their errors pointed out by their associations. However, factories that were previously disqualified from allocation by Fangjian, if it is found that they exchanged counts with yarn shops and not for the purpose of reselling for profit, and are still operating and do need yarn, will still be allocated yarn.</p>
<p>Money Supply to Tighten</p>
<p>The total amount of yarn allocated this time is more than 12,000 pieces, with a total price of more than 20 billion. The Textile Management Committee requires it to be paid off within three days. This is of great importance to the money supply in the market. Many industries such as handmade cotton weaving and knitting lack capital and have lower turnover capacity. They have repeatedly expressed to their respective associations that the allocation periods must be distributed and the payment dates must be extended. Each association has transferred the negotiations to the yarn allocation committee jointly formed by the reproduction industries to seek improvement. It is said that the joint allocation of yarn between Fangjian and private yarn factories was originally three times a week, but now it has been changed to once, which obviously does not take into account the difficulties of the allocated industries. If it is not improved urgently, it will cause Mayor Wu's original policy to lose its true meaning.</p>
<h3>Yarn Factory Electricity Saving Measures: Wages and Day/Night Shifts are a Problem</h3>
<p>This city has a dense population and numerous factories. The amount of electricity consumed has already reached saturation. In order to take care of both sides, the municipal government has reached an agreement with the power company on electricity saving measures. It is understood that all yarn factories in the city are divided into six groups, with a six-week cycle, that is, the first two weeks are four days and seven nights, the middle two weeks are five days and seven nights, and the last two weeks are six days and seven nights. The labor side believes that there are more night shifts and the work is hard. It has jointly applied to the Social Affairs Bureau with the capital side to stipulate that seven night shifts will be calculated as eight and a half days' wages. Due to power relations, night work is done for nine hours (the original work was ten hours), and wages are paid as usual. Those working less than nine hours will be paid half the wages proportionally. If day workers can only work for nine hours, they will be paid 9.5 days' wages.</p>
<p>In addition, since the yarn factories in this city implemented the new power distribution method, the original day and night shift times should be changed. However, some unreasonable workers believe that the work has increased and the income has not increased (referring to the fact that wages are paid as usual on Sundays). Therefore, there are complaints, and they refuse to work night shifts and rush to work day shifts, which has caused confusion in factory order. New No. 5 Factory, No. 7 Factory, and Weitong Yarn Factory have all experienced labor unrest. Hengfeng and Yongan No. 1 Factory have also been affected. After persuasion and mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau and the General Labor Union, except for a few details that have not yet been finalized at Weitong Factory, the other factories have resumed normal operation.</p>
<h3>Price Negotiation System in This City Starts with Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Since prices have gradually risen, the lives of ordinary citizens have been greatly threatened. When the Municipal Council met, a plan to suppress and stabilize prices was unanimously decided and sent to the municipal government for implementation. The municipal government has decided to start with daily necessities for general people's livelihood. In addition to the Textile Management Committee, which Mayor Wu himself serves as the chairman to actively promote, other items such as sugar, cotton cloth, wool yarn, rice, and cooking oil have all been ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau to organize committees separately to implement price negotiation. Among them, the sugar item has been decided to be distributed, and the distribution certificates have been printed and sent to the Civil Affairs Office last Saturday for distribution to various district offices. The implementation date is not far away.</p>
<h3>Fuel Management Committee will Adjust Coal Prices Next Month, Factory Coal Prices Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to adjust the allocation prices of various fuels starting from the first of next month due to the fact that the treatment of coal miners in various production areas has been improved several times and the transportation situation is not very good, resulting in a sharp increase in costs. Among them, except for the selling price of coal applied for by state-owned and private factories, which remains unchanged, the others will be moderately increased by 70% to 100%. In the allocation price set by the committee in August, private enterprises will be one-third higher than state-owned enterprises. In the future, they will be classified according to the difference in the nature of the enterprises, and the selling price of state-owned and private enterprises will be the same. The main allocation targets of the committee are water companies, power companies, ships, factories, and coal ball factories. The current cost of each ton of coal is 100,000 yuan. The committee's regular work is to use the surplus earned from allocation to various factories to supplement the losses in other public utilities.</p>
<h3>The Amount of Counterfeit Reserve Certificates Redeemed Totals More Than 4.2 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] According to relevant sources: The amount of counterfeit Central Reserve Certificates redeemed, from the beginning of November last year to the end of March this year, totaled 4,215,715,089,625.61 yuan. Later, in order to protect the interests of those who held the counterfeit banknotes but did not have time to exchange them for legal tender, the authorities decided to continue to register and redeem them from September 1 to September 30 this year. The total amount redeemed was 27,464,199,382.51 yuan. The total amount of the two redemptions is 4,243,179,289,008.12 yuan, which is still higher than the total amount of issuance announced by the counterfeit Central Reserve Bank. However, all counterfeit banknotes have been removed from this total redemption amount.</p>
<h3>Gejiu Tin is Oversold</h3>
<p>[Kunming, October 27th Dispatch] Gejiu's large tin production is far from covering costs, and sales are stagnant. For months, it has been on the verge of collapse. After representatives were elected to go to the province to make requests, it is now known that the transportation and sales office has agreed to request the central government to set the price for stored tin at 4.5 million yuan per ton. Based on current prices, if large tin can reach 5 million yuan per ton, there may be hope for the future of production.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Exports are Difficult, Conditions are Similar in Hong Kong and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] The market conditions of the tung oil industry in South China are similar to the scene of falling yellow leaves in this season. The previous stored oil has deteriorated, and it is now the tenth month of the lunar calendar, when tung oil seeds are ripe and it is time to press oil again. However, there is still a large amount of tung oil on the market. According to industry insiders, the demand from Europe and the United States has not decreased. On the contrary, there is a shortage of paint in the United States. However, on the other hand, a large number of products in our oil-producing areas are being abandoned. This contradictory phenomenon is heartbreaking. Currently, the selling price of tung oil in this city is above 160,000 yuan, which is the highest in various places. The current price in Shanghai is about 120,000 yuan, and the price in Hankou is also slightly above 120,000 yuan. In addition, the market price of tung oil in the United States is only about 35 US dollars, which, according to the official exchange rate, is still less than 120,000 yuan. However, the cost of shipping from Shanghai to the United States, including freight, is no less than 160,000 yuan. If shipped from this city to the United States, it would often be more than this. The stored oil can only be left to deteriorate.</p>
<p>The transportation and sales of tung oil in this city mainly focus on Europe, but due to the various situations mentioned above, exports are not cost-effective. Our country's inflation rate in the past eight years of the war is higher than that of other countries. It is estimated that current prices in the United States have increased by three times compared to before the war, while in our country, they have increased by about 5,000 times. In comparison, the difference is huge. Therefore, although American goods are expensive, it is still considered cheap to import them into China. Although domestic goods are cheap, it is considered expensive to export them to foreign countries. Tung oil exports are no exception.</p>
<h3>Tonics are in Season, Codonopsis Pilosula Stands Out</h3>
<p>Recently, the trend of traditional Chinese medicine has not improved. The prices of various goods continue to decline, but Codonopsis pilosula has shown unique brilliance. As an essential tonic in winter, sales are brisk, so Xikui Lude has increased by 16,000 yuan. The recent market prices are as follows: (unit: yuan)</p>
<p>Xikui Lude 16,000</p>
<p>Xitu Lude 14,000</p>
<p>Xigong Lude 12,000</p>
<p>Wen Dang Wang 12,000</p>
<p>Ten-Branch Angelica Sinensis 4,500</p>
<p>Fifteen-Branch Angelica Sinensis 3,200</p>
<p>Forty-Branch Angelica Head 18,000</p>
<p>Sixty-Branch Angelica Head 10,000</p>
<p>Eighty-Branch Angelica Head 6,000</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Sericulture Discusses Improvement Measures</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Sericulture Industry Association recently held its second member conference. Dozens of members attended. The Provincial Government, the Department of Construction, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the China Silk Corporation, the China Farmers Bank, and the Provincial Social Affairs Office all sent personnel to provide guidance. Chairman Xu Danren reported on the business situation over the past year and pointed out four points on how to improve the silkworm seed policy: (1) Cooperation between seed factories and silk factories; (2) Reasons for the failure of autumn seed production; (3) Improvement of seed production technology; (4) Requesting the Agricultural Bank to provide more loans. Subsequently, Section Chief Jiang of the _ Department of Construction and Zhu Xinyu, director of cocoon collection in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui of the China Silk Corporation, delivered speeches, and provided detailed discussions and opinions on the reasons for the low autumn seed production. After the speeches, the following issues were discussed: (1) Trying to achieve self-sufficiency in raw silk; (2) Progress on spring seed loans; (3) _ managed cold storage; (4) Determining spring seed prices.</p>
<h3>Dye Sales are Sluggish, the Stock of Defu Goods is Too Thin, and Substitutes are Unpopular</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] According to people in the dye industry, 70-80% of their business is special customized goods. The current transportation is not smooth, and purchasing from foreign cities is also sluggish. In this city, the sales volume is limited and purely depends on the prosperity of the silk and cotton cloth industries, which need the most stock. However, these two industries have not been very glorious or disgraced recently. In terms of dye supply, most foreign customers are accustomed to the Lion and Horse brand of Defu Foreign Company. The order forms received almost all specify Defu goods. Although foreign goods of the same type and quality are available, they are not popular. Because the liquidation office of Defu Foreign Company can only allocate a small amount of goods each week, and the stock is becoming increasingly thin. In terms of imports, the dye production in various countries is very small since the beginning of the post-war recovery. They are barely able to take care of themselves, and the amount of dye that can be exported is often very limited. On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of ships, so few goods arrive. Therefore, there is no guarantee of a normal supply of dyes. After the foreign exchange adjustment in August, the prices of various dyes in this city generally increased by 60% to 100%, but business has not improved. In addition, there are many difficulties such as the lack of restored transportation in various places and the lack of dye supply. The recent situation of the industry is only described as unremarkable.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Reeling is Too Heavy, Three Dan of Japanese Cocoons Can Reel One Dan of Silk</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Relevant personnel told reporters: The restoration of our country's silk industry is extremely difficult due to the heavy losses during the war; even with the full assistance of the government, it will take at least two years to restore pre-war production levels. The improvement of silkworm species is one of the most important tasks at present. Compared with Japan, three dan of Japanese cocoons can produce one dan of silk, while our country needs four dan. The variety is obviously behind. It is also learned that the Japanese original cocoons are difficult to obtain because the other party keeps the secret very strictly.</p>
<h3>Fierce Competition and Weak Purchasing Power: The Southern Goods Industry Also Falls into Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A person in charge of the Shanghai Southern Goods Industry Association recently told reporters: In this city, operators in the southern goods industry are divided by the type of goods. Sugar is the largest category, followed by seafood and dried longan. Taking sugar as an example, there are no less than seven well-funded firms engaged in procurement, and over one hundred wholesalers. There are over two hundred wholesalers dealing in seafood. More than sixty firms rely on trading dried longan for a living. In the past, the largest portion of sugar came from Java. The quality was the best, and the sweetness of seventy catties was comparable to one hundred catties of other types of sugar, hence the common name "70% sugar." However, since the victory, due to a shortage of ships, not much has arrived. Second-grade sugar comes from Taiwan and Fujian. Taiwanese sugar was refined during the Japanese era, making it white and attractive. It is said that it contained bone meal, hence the name "meat sugar." After our country took over Taiwan, the Taiwanese sugar became grayish in color and contained many impurities. The price of sugar in this city is about 190,000 yuan per dan at the highest and about 110,000 yuan at the lowest. Currently, the types of Taiwanese sugar valued by the Social Affairs Bureau are medium-grained raw sugar and fine-grained raw sugar. Although sugar is a necessity, it is taxed heavily. Before the war, the cost of a bag of sugar was four yuan, but the sugar tax was eight yuan. Today, on average, a bag of sugar is taxed about 60,000 yuan. There are not many domestic goods among seafood, limited to fresh fish from Fujian. The majority is British goods. As for dried longan, Fujian goods are very good, while those from Xiamen are of poorer quality. This year is a poor year for dried longan, and not much has arrived. Shanghai is the distribution center for the above three types of southern goods. Operating in the southern goods industry does not require extremely large capital, nor is it as difficult as running an industrial enterprise, but it also has its own problems: (1) Sales are sluggish due to weak purchasing power. At the same time, apart from sugar, southern goods are not necessities. Moreover, many new southern goods stores have opened recently, leading to fierce competition. As a result, southern goods stores have had poor business since the Mid-Autumn Festival. (2) High interest loans are also a major threat, with interest rates as high as 16% or 17%. (3) For the benefit of retailers and consumers, it is best for the procurement firms to establish a "Procurement Industry Association" to purchase directly from production locations, which can avoid exploitation by middlemen.</p>
<h3>The Seriousness of the Current Rural "Capital" and "Labor" Problems</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bo’an</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the war, the rural labor force has long become a serious problem. After the victory, some lands abandoned due to the war were re-cultivated. However, rural labor is expensive, and farmers lack production capital, resulting in increasing production costs. "A good harvest means a lifetime of hardship; a lean year inevitably leads to death" is a true depiction of the current rural situation. If we want to understand the crux of the current rural decline, there are only two points: one is the shortage of rural production capital, and the other is the seriousness of the rural labor shortage. These are described below:</p>
<p>(1) The Exhaustion of Rural Production Capital: China's rural areas are vast, and they stand in the scientific age of the twentieth century with the most ancient production methods, while cities are like blood vessels that absorb the vast rural areas. Therefore, as early as ten or twenty years ago, there were already voices of rural collapse. The eight years of hard fighting have further depleted the vitality of the countryside. In addition, wherever the beasts went, houses were reduced to ruins. Restoring the countryside will take decades, and under this realistic rural situation, how can there not be a shortage of rural capital? When capital is exhausted, production is reduced accordingly. Agricultural affairs are restricted by natural seasons. Whenever "capital" is needed, it is often impossible to obtain it. Even if it can be obtained, the future crops must first be used as collateral for the loan. In recent years, the efforts of agricultural banks to provide agricultural loans seem to have brought some benefits to the countryside. However, providing for the vast rural areas with limited capital feels like a drop in the ocean. In terms of the actual situation of agricultural loans, it is feared that very few genuine farmers can access national funds. As Mr. Jiang Baili said, Chinese affairs can only be viewed with a telescope, not with a microscope. Everything is the same, and how can "agricultural loans" be an exception? Furthermore, in terms of agricultural harvests, this year's rice fields have had favorable weather and abundant harvests. Assuming that each mu of rice field yields two shi of rice (author's note: In the Jiangnan area, each mu of rice field originally yielded an average of 2.5 shi, but due to reduced fertilization and insufficient labor in recent years, two shi is now the highest ideal yield). It takes three months and requires ten laborers, costing 3,000 yuan per laborer, totaling 30,000 yuan. Fertilizer and seeds cost about 20,000 yuan, totaling 50,000 yuan. The harvest of two shi of rice is currently priced at 35,000 yuan per shi of brown rice at the production site, totaling 70,000 yuan. Adding the income from rice straw is 2,000 yuan, totaling 72,000 yuan. With three months of time and 50,000 yuan of capital, the harvest is 72,000 yuan. Therefore, the average income per mu of rice field is 7,000 yuan. This refers to owner-farmers. For tenant farmers, after paying the rent, how much is left? Therefore, this year, there are more and more coolies from the countryside in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) The Seriousness of the Rural Labor Shortage: Staying put and guarding their homes is the indomitable spirit of our farmers. Even during the war, when the flames of war were raging, farmers would not abandon their fields and ancestral graves unless absolutely necessary. After the victory, why did they abandon their fields and wander around? This question is worth studying. First, they can no longer struggle on the death line in the countryside. Farming means only death, and wandering to the city is better than death. As a result, the rural population has greatly shifted to the cities. Although life in the city is difficult, it is a million times better than in the countryside. This phenomenon is very frightening. Second, in the current rural society, the unsoundness of basic-level politics often makes it impossible for farmers to withstand the heavy exploitation. This is a fact. Third, production capital is exhausted, so they have no choice but to abandon it and change course. The above three problems are the biggest reasons for the migration of the rural population. However, the migration of the rural population to the cities has made rural labor more expensive, and production volume and productivity have declined even further. This is simply the eve of the total collapse of the countryside.</p>
<p>The decline of industry and commerce and the hardship of people's livelihoods depend fundamentally on the efforts to revive the countryside. Otherwise, any rescue measures are unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Opening Up the Silk Market, Sending Personnel to India</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The China Silk Company will send personnel to India in the shortest possible time to conduct liaison work and seek to expand overseas markets. Related people told reporters: India is the most promising market for raw silk exports. Because before the war, a lot of Japanese goods were used in the raw silk in India. If our country can take over this part of the market, the amount will be considerable. Secondly, the price of silk in the Indian market today is higher than that in Europe and the United States. If our country can export in large quantities, it will naturally be profitable. However, it is regrettable that when the War of Resistance was just won, a group of speculators sold more than 4,000 packages of the worst quality old silk to Indian merchants, causing our country's commercial credit to be completely lost. At present, even if Indian merchants place orders, they are for small quantities of one or two hundred packages, and they dare not order large quantities at all. The purpose of sending personnel to India this time is to explain the misunderstanding and seek to open up the Indian market.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Tenders for Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent to sell government materials and property, will be tendering for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rayon fabrics, rock sugar, and white sugar, as well as a batch of various parts, on the 29th of this month at 3:00 PM. Bidding will start from today until 12:00 PM on the 29th.</p>
<h3>A List of New Invention Patents Approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs Since the Restoration; There Are Still Twenty-Two Cases Under Review</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since the National Government promulgated regulations to encourage industrial technology and implemented them, many items or methods researched by Chinese people in industrial technology have been submitted for awards and have been approved for patents. According to Director Wu Chengluo of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and related authorities, the ministry has received more than 1,400 applications for inventions to date. More than 500 people have been approved for patents and have obtained patent certificates. In addition to sincerely encouraging such inventions, the ministry is working hard to strengthen its organization and actively expand its work. During the War of Resistance, those who had already obtained patent rights but suffered losses due to the war or were unable to manufacture and sell them due to obstruction could state their reasons and apply for an extension of their patent period. It is reported that the ministry has reviewed and approved twenty-two invention cases. This is the first public announcement since the restoration, and there are also twenty-two invention cases under review. The patents that have been reviewed and approved are listed below:</p>
<p>Name Approved Content</p>
<p>Wang Pei New type of gas cooking stove Patent for five years</p>

Once the review is completed, it will be announced in accordance with the law. (Urgent Public)</p>
<h3>Smuggling Impairs the Match Industry; Current Production is Only 60% of Pre-War Levels; Competition is Too Fierce, but Quality Has Improved</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Related parties told reporters: The production volume of the match industry in this city is currently only about 60% of the pre-war level. The main reason for the decline in production is that competition is too fierce and sales are poor. Since 1941, many small factories have been established in this city. The production costs of their products are lower, so they sell very well in rural areas. According to statistics from the industry association, there are a total of twenty-four large-scale match factories in this city, with Da Zhonghua and Da Ming being the largest, each with a registered capital of 10 million yuan. The registered capital of the remaining historical match factories ranges from 5 million to 50 million yuan. As for the exact production numbers of each factory, the association is still investigating. The sales of matches produced in this city are mainly along the Beijing-Shanghai line, and some are transported to the north. According to people in the industry, the quality of matches is currently slightly better than before the war. Foreigners who have set up match factories include the American Meiguang Company, which produces Rose Tree and Wheel Brand matches, and the Swedish Ruizhong Foreign Firm, which produces Phoenix Brand matches. Both factories have a long history and are large in scale, but because they do not join the industry association, their production volume is unknown. There are not many imported matches. Some are relief supplies sold on the market, and there are also a large number of matches sold without stamps, which are smuggled goods. In terms of raw materials for matches, self-sufficiency was once possible during the war. Shanghai once had the establishment of the Shanghai Match Raw Material Factory; today, with the sea route reopened and a large number of American goods pouring in, this factory has closed down. What the match industry hopes for at present is to effectively crack down on smuggling to maintain normal business.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Who Resumed Business Loans with Priority for Those Who Resisted the Enemy</h3>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, a considerable number of our overseas compatriots in various places directly or indirectly participated in the motherland, or assisted in the local work of resisting the enemy. Among them, there were also many who went bankrupt as a result. In order to commend national integrity and encourage loyalty, our government intends to formulate measures for overseas Chinese to resume business loans, with the right to enjoy priority loans for those who have made contributions during the enemy occupation period. The Bangkok Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang directly under the Central Overseas Department received a telegram from the Central Overseas Department, Jinghai San (35), No. 1133, which provided some explanation of the measures. The overseas party departments at all levels should take note of this. According to the application submitted by the Philippine General Branch, overseas Chinese who have had their property confiscated should be granted priority loan rights. The Ministry of Finance has approved the letter, Caiqian Yi, No. 17676, dated April 13, 1946. The letter stated, "After the promulgation and implementation of the measures for overseas Chinese to resume business loans, in order to reward overseas Chinese who have made contributions to the work of resisting the enemy during the enemy occupation period, this department has determined the order of priority for loans as follows: (1) Overseas Chinese who directly participated in the motherland or local work of resisting the enemy during the enemy occupation period, (2) Those who indirectly participated in assisting the motherland or local work of resisting the enemy, (3) Those who did not cooperate with the enemy. Those who participated in enemy or puppet organizations or are suspected of colluding with the enemy will not be granted loans. The above situations should be certified separately by the overseas consulates in accordance with Article 4 of the Measures for Overseas Chinese to Resume Business Loans for the overseas Chinese who are applying for loans, and the handling bank shall handle them in accordance with the regulations. The head office has already handled them in accordance with the regulations. I hereby reply to the inquiry and request that it be forwarded to all comrades and overseas Chinese for their information." - Central Overseas Department, Shiyin.</p>
<h3>Indian Government Collects Export Tax on Raw Cotton at 20 Rupees per Bale</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 6th] The Indian government today promulgated a decree stipulating that the government may collect export tax on raw cotton, and the tax rate may be changed at any time within the prescribed maximum amount. This decree shall take effect from today, and the central government announced that from today until further notice, the export tax on raw cotton is set at 20 rupees per bale.</p>
<h3>Japan's Cocoon Transportation to China Not Yet Ready</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The issue of transporting Japanese cocoons to China has not been resolved because an agreement has not yet been reached on the quantity and price, so the person in charge of China Silk has not yet made the trip. At present, this matter is still being fully negotiated by Mr. Zhu Shiming. If the transportation of Japanese cocoons to China cannot be realized, silk factories in our country will generally suspend work for half a year; if the quantity is less than 10 million pounds, there will also be partial shutdowns. Chu Fucheng, chairman of the Silk Filature Association of the Third District (Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui), has requested the government to pay attention and strive for the transportation of Japanese cocoons to China in order to save the crisis in the silk filature industry.</p>
<h3>US Lumber Exports Decrease</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The US Civilian Production Administration announced: In the three months of the third quarter of 1946, the US's lumber exports decreased by 20 million board feet because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has agreed to change the original procurement of lumber from the United States to procurement from the Soviet Union and Brazil for foreign use. The United States can use the lumber saved for housing construction. The United States originally planned to export 199.3 million board feet of lumber in these three months, but in reality, 129.3 million board feet were exported.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of the World Cotton Market After Fluctuations in US Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Manchester, 6th] The Manchester Guidance Report stated: Lancashire is not surprised by the rise and fall of New York cotton prices. Other cotton-producing countries' markets have tried to avoid being involved in the whirlpool of fluctuations in the US cotton market. Bombay cotton prices fluctuated slightly at one time, but are currently higher than in early October. Alexandria market prices seem to be still bullish. The São Paulo cotton market was once affected by the sharp drop in US cotton prices, but the general situation is also quite optimistic, because Brazil's cotton exports to the United States, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands have increased compared to last year.</p>
<h3>The Bureau for the Disposal of Enemy Property in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regularly Clears All Warehouses</h3>
<p>The Bureau for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will be closed at the end of this year, and some institutions are gradually being scaled down. All received enemy and puppet materials are being sold off at an accelerated pace, entering the liquidation phase. It is reported that the bureau is counting warehouse materials. If the materials are of large quantity and value, they will be entrusted to relevant professional institutions for sorting and resale. Other remaining materials, or scattered and disorganized items, or bulky and difficult to move, cannot be entrusted to agencies for resale one by one. They will be entrusted to the Jianghai Customs to auction the warehouses as units, scheduling dates for each warehouse. Later, in order to expand the scope of the auction, the Central Trust Bureau was also entrusted to set up a resale committee to handle the auction. This work has been going on for five months since the beginning, with an average monthly income of more than 20 billion yuan, all of which has been remitted to the national treasury. Due to the stepped-up cleaning last month, the income reached 37 billion yuan, and this month's income is also expected to maintain this figure.

<h3>The Penalty Kick Almost Led to Displeasure: Donghua Defeats Longjie Juniors: Result 2-1, Longjie Lacked Experience: Disobeyed the Referee's Decision, Persuaded to Continue the Game</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the second act of the Group A football match, Donghua veterans fought Longjie rookies at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. Donghua finally defeated Longjie with their battlefield experience. The result was 2-1. Donghua took the lead 1-0 in the first half. After all, Longjie's juniors were less experienced. In contrast, Donghua was more stable. Although Longjie was young and strong, due to playing small football for a long time, their position and playing style needed to be improved, and the strength of the forwards was also poor. However, they fought very hard and have hope in the future. The audience wanted to know what kind of team the new army was, so they came in droves, and there were also three or four thousand fans.</p>
<p>Donghua Scores First: Donghua kicked off and attacked. Youliang shot high, and Li quickly, was caught by Sheng Peter. Donghua failed to enter several times, and the three armies worked hard. Huang Kehou dribbled forward, passed it to Chen Mingzhe, and picked it up to Youliang. Jia cleverly passed it to Li , who lived up to his mission and built the first success for Donghua, one quarter of an hour after the start of the game. Longjie's rookies counterattacked, but all failed. After thirty minutes, Longhai missed twice, and Li swept near the door, but he was still caught by Sheng Peter, all in vain. The first half ended, with Donghua leading 1-0.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick: After changing sides, Longjie replaced Zhang Jiuqing with Shen Jinda. Longjie attacked first, and Wang Burong shot wildly. Longhai shot, but was saved by Sheng Peter. Longjie's fortunes finally turned around. After ten minutes, Wang Burong threw a boundary ball, and Gao Xiuqing built a single-handed success and returned, tying the score at 1-1. Since then, although Donghua's offensive was frequent, it all failed until the 42nd minute, when Longjie's Zhou Yongfang committed a handball in the penalty area and was judged to have a penalty kick. Donghua's Tan Fuzhen took the knife and hit it in one fell swoop. However, at this time, Longjie's players believed that the handball was outside the penalty area and should not be judged as a penalty kick, and they planned to leave the field immediately. Fortunately, the main cadre Cui Shifu knew the general situation and ordered them to enter the field to replay. Before long, the statutory time had arrived, and Donghua narrowly defeated Longjie 2-1.</p>

<h3>Abuse of the Red Cross Symbol; Municipal Government Ordered to Ban It</h3>
<p>The General Association of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China believes that the Red Cross emblem should be jointly owned by all Red Cross societies worldwide. Except as stipulated in the 1929 International Red Cross Convention, all rescue teams accompanying the military, those used for transporting, examining, and caring for the wounded and sick, and personnel engaged in the management of rescue teams' weaving locations, as well as military chaplains, are protected by the convention with the Chinese government's recognition and permission for personnel of rescue associations and rescue equipment, and have the right to use the special white-background red cross symbol. Other individuals or associations are not allowed to use it, and even more, are not allowed to impersonate this Red Cross symbol and name for commercial or other purposes. However, since the War of Resistance against Japan, non-statutory health organizations and practicing physicians in various places have widely abused the white-background red cross symbol, which is detrimental to international reputation. A telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan requesting it to instruct provincial and municipal governments to direct their subordinates, together with the local authorities in charge, to strictly prohibit such abuses in order to rectify international perception. It is reported that after receiving the order from the Executive Yuan, the municipal government yesterday issued instructions to its subordinates to comply.</p>

<h3>Cross-Section of Wuyuan Tea; Once Shone Infinitely in the International Market</h3>
<p>— Wuyuan Quick News, 12th; Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo</p>
<p>The foundation of a country's economy must have many special products as its source. The lifeline of a county's economy also has one or two products as the basis of its livelihood. Large ones like the silk and cotton of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the grain of Hunan and Jiangxi, and small ones like the porcelain of Jingdezhen and the black tea of Qimen, each have been endowed with unique vitality due to soil and climate.</p>
<p>"Qihong" (Qimen Black Tea) and "Wulv" (Wuyuan Green Tea) are the highest grades among China's exported "yangzhuang" teas. Wuyuan's precious green tea has always been known worldwide along with Qimen black tea. The total number of tea farmers, tea merchants, tea workers, and tea companies in the county who depend on tea for a living is no less than 50,000. The regulation of rural finance also relies on tea prices and wages to circulate. The history of Wuyuan tea trade has lasted for more than 200 years, but now it has disappeared invisibly in the short period of seven or eight years, which is truly heartbreaking!</p>

<p>Wuyuan's Chouzhen, Tezhen, Zhenmei, Meimei, Tegong, Mazhu, Zhenmei, and other green teas have always been the main products for foreign export and occupy an important position in the international market. Before the War of Resistance against Japan, Wuyuan tea production was more than 100,000 boxes per year, which recovered a considerable amount of lost revenue. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the export of tea was severely hit. Especially after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the foreign sales of "yangzhuang" boxed tea were completely blocked. The tea firms that operated "yangzhuang" tea closed down one after another, and tea merchants and tea workers switched to small-scale brokerage, living as independent brokers, selling to inland ports such as Nanchang, Ji'an, Wucheng, Zhangshu, and Ganzhou, depending on the convenience of waterway transportation. The lively scenes of tea companies gathering in various villages once a year have not been seen today.</p>
<p>New Tea Production</p>
<p>The four borders of this county are mostly mountainous, and the area planted with tea is second only to rice fields. Whether in remote mountain corners, flat gardens, all are planted with tea bushes. In the past, the output of spring tea was as high as 70,000 to 80,000 dan per year. In the past ten years, the output has gradually decreased. This year, the total output of new tea in the county is less than 6,000 dan, which is almost a tenfold decrease compared with the previous year. The degree of decline is unbelievable. There are four reasons for this: (1) tea gardens are converted to plant cotton and miscellaneous grains; (2) due to the lack of labor, the tea is left uncultivated and not picked or produced; (3) summer tea is not picked; (4) no human fertilizer is added for cultivation. Due to these four reasons, tea seems to have been abandoned by tea farmers as waste, no wonder the production has naturally declined.</p>
<p>Tea Farmers' Trend</p>
<p>In the past, when the tea market was booming, as soon as the new tea started to be produced, the tea companies would mobilize to purchase it. Before the tea was finished, it would be bought by the companies competing with each other. The tea farmers relied on this regular income to maintain their agricultural capital. The total annual tea price income of the county was a larger amount than any other local product. As the saying goes, "Those who have a stable income have a stable mind." The tea farmers relied on this reliable stable income throughout the year, focusing their energy on the tea gardens, fertilizing, and expanding the tea land, putting their greatest effort into the green tea trees, hoping for increased production. In recent years, the situation is the opposite of the past. The produced tea is left unattended. Carrying it on their shoulders to sell, the price obtained does not cover the cost of the tea. As the saying goes, "Those who have no stable income have no stable mind." This makes them complain about the tea production, and they have to find other ways to make a living. This is a natural trend, without any element of forced possibility.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Sales</p>
<p>Tea is divided into "yangzhuang" and "benzhuang." "Yangzhuang" boxed tea is sold to Europe and America, and "benzhuang" basket tea is sold domestically. In the past, "yangzhuang" boxed tea exports accounted for 90% of the output, while "benzhuang" only accounted for 10%. In recent years, the export route has been blocked. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the Huizhou tea market in Hangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou could not be exported. The "benzhuang" basket tea purchased by stores was only sold to various ports in the unoccupied areas, and the quantity was very small. Although the enemy-occupied areas offered higher prices to purchase Huizhou tea, merchants in this county did not dare to try this smuggling risk. The produced tea could only be left to mold, without finding other outlets. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, domestic and foreign sales remained sluggish, and there was no sign of improvement. The sales volume of "yangzhuang" tea companies in this county this year is only 2,000 to 3,000 dan, and the domestic store sales market is even smaller than in previous years. Even the Xiehechang Tea Company, which was known as the largest in the area, only purchased more than 300 dan of tea this year. The amount collected by other scattered tea vendors is even smaller. At present, Taiwan's red and green tea and Japanese tea have large production volumes and are sold abroad at lower costs than Chinese tea. Looking at the current domestic and foreign sales of Wuyuan green tea, the future may be even more bleak, which is not yet known.</p>
<p>Tea Companies Lack Capital</p>
<p>In the past, there were no less than 300 tea companies in this county. Each tea company only needed 10,000 yuan of its own capital and a loan of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan from a tea warehouse to start producing 200 to 300 boxes of tea for the year's business. Because at that time, the price of tea was low, only 20 to 30 yuan per dan. Each company purchased 300 dan of tea, only requiring 10,000 yuan for the tea price. The remaining labor, food, raw materials, and transportation costs only required more than 10,000 yuan. The capital of each tea company, the larger ones (producing more boxes) were 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and the smaller ones were 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and most were sole proprietorships, with very few joint-stock organizations. Now the price of tea has increased, each dan costs 100,000 yuan or more. Processing 100 dan of tea requires capital of 10 million yuan. Each tea company must process at least 200 dan of tea, which requires capital of 20 million yuan. Adding the cost of tin, boxes, paper, indigo, raw materials, tea making, tea picking, tea roasting, screening, labor, and transportation costs requires 40 million yuan. A tea company that processes 200 dan of tea needs a total capital of 60 million yuan. The tea merchants in this county have weak financial resources, and they can only sigh at the current operation of tea companies!</p>
<p>Although the government has released tea loans, prudent tea merchants believe that the interest rate is too high and the procedures are too restrictive. If they receive a tea loan, they must produce tea. If the cost increases and the tea does not sell, they will not be able to repay the principal and interest within the limited time. If they recognize the interest for a long time, they will lose all their capital and accumulate debts. The reason why tea companies dare not open their doors now is because they lack funds, and they really have the difficulty of "short sleeves making it hard to dance."</p>
<p>Market Price Increase</p>
<p>For any business, one must calculate the cost of one's goods before proceeding with the transaction. In the past, the cost of raw tea was only 20 to 30 yuan per dan, and tea farmers still had a small profit. This year, the price of tea has risen to 100,000 yuan, and tea farmers believe that there is no profit, regardless of the effort to make tea. Tea companies purchase tea at 100,000 yuan per dan, and adding labor, raw materials, and transportation costs, each dan of tea costs 300,000 yuan. At the current Shanghai market price, the highest-priced tea has not reached this value, and there is no profit to be made. If the desire of tea farmers is to be satisfied, the price of each dan of tea must be increased to 200,000 yuan, and the cost of raw materials and labor will inevitably rise accordingly. Thus, the selling price of each dan of tea must be 1 million yuan to make a profit. The price of 1 million yuan per dan of tea, I am afraid that among all kinds of native products in the world, there is absolutely no such high price. If the tea trade can turn around in the future, the price of tea should be reduced as much as possible to reduce costs as the first step. From the perspectives of production, consumption, and the foreign market, the way out for Wuyuan tea is to estimate that the price of tea will not increase in the future.</p>
<p>Future Tea Industry</p>
<p>Every product will inevitably undergo a change after a certain period. Wuyuan tea trade has a history of more than 200 years, and it is now facing a disaster, perhaps entering a period of transformation. However, when trying to measure the reasons for its transformation, there are traces to be found. The mountainous soil of Wuyuan has not changed, and the color, aroma, and taste of tea have not changed in the slightest. The reputation of "Qihong" and "Wulv" will not be allowed to be copied by other teas.</p>
<p>The reason why it cannot become more prosperous day by day and cannot compete with foreign tea in the market is that human efforts and improved new knowledge have not been fully utilized. (1) Tea farmers do not put their efforts into cultivation and provide effective cultivation and nourishment suitable for the tea's nature. (2) Tea farmers mostly seek quick results and ease in tea picking, tea kneading, and tea roasting, without refining the picking of tender tea and producing it carefully. There are even inferior practices of crude picking, rough drying, and sun-drying. (3) Tea companies have short capital and lack the organization of large-scale companies. The manufacturing methods and decorations are mostly reduced in workmanship and crude materials, without seeking improvement. (4) Tea companies only know how to engage in brokerage and make profits, without deep-seated competition. (5) The government lacks low-interest loan assistance and practical management, and lacks specialized technical personnel to help improve.</p>
<p>With a rare natural special product in the world, they do not know how to cherish and value it, letting it grow and die on its own. No wonder the tea market is declining day by day and it is difficult to step onto the broad road of the international market. In the future, if we want to reverse the decline of the tea industry, the government, tea farmers, tea merchants, and tea workers must work together to understand how beneficial the export of tea is to the country and what the relationship is between the interests of tea farmers, tea merchants, and tea workers. How to improve the manufacturing and planting, so that the production can be increased and the tea quality can be improved, and what methods can be used to compete with foreign tea. If we understand these four key points, perhaps the buried tea market will have the hope of restoring prosperity, otherwise the future market will only provide tea people with the illusion of mirages and false hopes, which cannot give us real success.</p>
<h3>The Thirteenth Army in Rehe; Defend Must Be Solid, Attack Must Be Victorious; Fighting Rats Like Fighting Tigers</h3>
<p>—航讯, 16th; Ziji, Posted from Chengde</p>
<p>Chengde is a summer resort for Qing emperors. In order to promote border policy, palaces and eight large-scale Lama temples were built here. Although it has experienced several disturbances and was destroyed, the painted pavilions and carved beams are still there, but they are dilapidated and desolate. The towering Six Harmonies Pagoda, the winding palace walls, the verdant and graceful ancient pines, and the lotus-filled Ruyi Island still faintly show the prosperity of that year. Sitting upright among the steles and inscriptions, one feels deeply the ancient meaning. At the northern end of Ruyi Yuan, there is a long rectangular pond made of stone, which is said to be the Rehe River. Even in the middle of winter, its water does not freeze. The name Rehe may have originated from this.</p>
<p>The Shield of North China Behind the Northeast</p>
<p>Rehe is a province in Inner Mongolia and a stepping stone for foreign invaders in past dynasties. Its location is outside the Great Wall, with the Yinshan Mountains running across it, forming a barrier with the heart of North China, Tianjin and Beijing. The independence of Outer Mongolia is not only insufficient as a buffer zone between China and the Soviet Union, but also makes the position of Inner Mongolia in national defense even more important. Shanhaiguan, Xifengkou, and Gubeikou are the passages into and out of the Great Wall. Rehe is the corridor between the Northeast and Guannei, serving as the rear of the Northeast and the shield of North China.</p>
<p>Rehe is a barren province. Due to climate and soil, it cannot be listed as a major grain-producing area. However, the coal of Fuxin and Beipiao, and the fur of Chifeng Weichang, can also be used for national defense needs. The Fuxin and Beipiao coal mines were mined extensively during the Japanese occupation, making them the most important industrial areas after Fushun. The fire power here far exceeds the power generated by the wartime capital Chongqing. It can be used by towns hundreds of miles away. In addition, coal, gold, silver, lead, zinc, iron ore, medicinal materials, timber, sorghum, and other products buried underground should not be ignored. The province's main transportation network is composed of the Jin (zhou), Gu (beikou), Ye (baishou), and Chi (feng) railways. The military value of these two railways far exceeds their commercial value. All important towns in the territory are accessible by highways, which are very convenient for military and civilian use. The province covers an area of more than 190,000 square kilometers and is inhabited by 6 million people, including 800,000 Mongolians. The administrative "separate governance" and "joint governance" of Han and Mongolians have been reformed many times, and there is still no final conclusion. After the independence of Outer Mongolia and the strange drama of so-called "East Mongolia Autonomous Region" directed by the Chinese Communists, the problems of these ethnic minorities have become more complex, but it seems that they have not reached a serious stage. The general public was already very poor. After twelve years of exploitation by the Japanese and one year of "benevolent rule" by the Chinese Communists, food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all problems, and they are already facing a serious stage. Sorghum, millet, and potatoes are the main food crops. After the Communist army's large-scale requisition, there is widespread famine everywhere, especially the lack of clothing, which is barely enough to cover the body. Most children are naked, and even the whole family shares a pair of pants. When one person goes out, the whole family has to close the door and sleep.</p>
<p>Soviet Soldiers Bring Eighth Route Army and Communist Representatives</p>
<p>After the Japanese army entered Rehe, it was included in the "Puppet Manchukuo" territory, and all facilities were the same as those in the Northeast. It initially showed leniency, and then used the police to strictly control it. To this day, people still turn pale at the mention of the police. Last year, on August 15, Japan surrendered, and the Soviet army entered from Outer Mongolia. Many enemy and puppet materials and people's property followed them. Their military discipline left a very deep impression on the people's minds. At the same time, they brought the "People's Army" – the Eighth Route Army, all empty-handed, carrying their bags, claiming to have fought against Japan for eight years and defeated the enemy, "Don't you need weapons to fight a war, just talk with your mouth?" The people had the first question about the Eighth Route Army. The weapons of the Eighth Route Army were distributed outside the customs. Under the slogan of "democracy," they held "popular elections for chairman." Li Yunchang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, issued a declaration of "protecting the safety of the lives and property of the people of Rehe." The situation at that time was difficult to understand. It is unlikely that other political parties participated in the election. They used cars to transport the so-called "people's representatives from various counties" to participate in the election. They raised their hands to vote on the spot, and Li Yunchang was elected as the chairman of Rehe Province. After that, the "struggles" and "liquidations" made the safety of the lives and property of the people a problem, negating their promises. When the national army recovered Chengde, the "popularly elected provincial government" was said to have moved north or south. It is impossible to determine. Based on the principle of "counties not leaving counties and townships not leaving townships," it is natural that "provinces do not leave provinces either." Anyway, in this province, there are many mountains and no one knows where they are.</p>
<h3>The People of Rehe Have Four Comments on the Communist Army: A Knife's Heart, Tofu's Mouth, Small Leather Belly, Rabbit's Legs</h3>
<p>Compatriots in government-controlled areas have always considered the "liberated areas" a mystery. Were they "heaven" or "hell"? Once you arrive in the newly recovered areas, you will know. All the compatriots in Rehe have praised it with one voice. In the demobilization and reorganization of the army, they actively "expanded the army" and "contributed grain," and the army lived in the homes of the people, breaking the propaganda of "reducing rent and interest." Unlimited "contributions," the Communist soldiers ate free meals in the homes of the people, turning the people into paupers. "Liquidation" is the largest corruption case ever. Each time "liquidation" is carried out, in addition to the land, houses, and furniture being distributed to the poor, the remaining cash and valuables are contributed to the "government" and put into private pockets. In the Communist army, Communist Party members eat white noodles and are given seven catties of pork per month to show preferential treatment. Such a political party is also unseen and unheard of. The most beautiful trick they play is destruction. Whether it is railways, highways, factories, mines, electricity, telephones, or all public buildings and houses of rich families, all are destroyed. It is said that destruction is a means of striving for democracy. The railway industry operated by the Japanese during the occupation had reserved value in terms of military, political, and livelihood aspects. What is left now is a vast expanse of desolation. This kind of action is not understood by patriots. Most of the soldiers of the Communist army are forced to join, and they are strictly monitored and cannot be dispersed to fight. Therefore, they often adopt night attacks and dense charges. The only tactic of the Communist army commanders to attack fortified positions is to drive the soldiers into the national army's fire net. They often lie dead in front of machine guns. The Communist army's escape wind is extremely strong, so the combat power consumed in desertion is more than the casualties. The people in the "liberated areas" are not deaf or dumb, and they have their own public opinion. It's just that the voice is too weak. There are four popular comments in Rehe about the Chinese Communist Party: "A knife's heart, a tofu's mouth, a small leather belly, and a rabbit's legs."</p>
<p>Rehe was also a place that had been occupied for twelve years. The government's takeover was entirely armed. The receiving personnel followed the army forward. Government agencies, warehouses, factories, and people had all been "liberated" and had become deserted. The property received had long fallen into the hands of others, leaving behind a broken city and countryside waiting to be restored. From the time the national army entered Rehe in January to the ceasefire on January 13, the vanguard only reached Pingquan, and what was received was only a railway line that was uncertain from morning to night. The orders of the provincial government could not be separated from the railway, and the orders of the county government could not get out of the city gate. The so-called "anti-Japanese regime" still exists in the countryside. Personnel from administrative agencies only operate in the areas where the army is stationed, laying the foundation for the takeover after the area is captured. The war situation has turned around, and Chengde, Weichang, Chifeng, and Micheng have been recovered at a rapid speed. The recovered area has been expanded, and the administrative personnel have been stimulated by the new expansion, and they have launched new receiving work in coordination with military operations. The administrative efficiency has obviously improved a lot compared with half a year ago.</p>
<p>A Powerful Long Spear Inserted into the Interior of Rehe to Cover the Corridor Between the Northeast and North China</p>
<p>At most, there were four and a half divisions of the national army here, and at least there was only one 13th Army. It has supported itself in this difficult and arduous environment for more than half a year. This elite force is equipped with American weapons and is full of vitality. In Bailingmiao, Nankou, Xinkou, Taierzhuang, Jiangbei, Enan, Ebei, Exi, Guinan, Guiliu, Wu Sui, and Dedi, it left behind brilliant achievements and has always stood on the front line of national defense. During the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, it traversed the areas of the border fortress, the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River, without staying there for consolidation. The opportunity for their training is in combat and long and hot marches. In mid-November of last year, it knocked on the door of Shanhaiguan and became the first to set foot in the Northeast, which had been occupied for fourteen years. It recovered Suizhong in one breath, laying the foundation for determining the takeover of the Northeast. In January of this year, braving the wind and snow, it recovered the two major mining areas of Beizhen and Beipiao, and was advancing north. Suddenly, it made a 90-degree turn to the left and entered the interior of Rehe like lightning. As soon as it arrived in Pingquan, it received a ceasefire order and stopped moving forward. An army drew a line from Xingcheng in the east to Benxi, through Beipiao, Gushan, Chaoyang, Yebaishou, Lingyuan, and even Pingquan, a snake formation that was more than a thousand miles long. Even people who don't understand military affairs were nervous for them. In fact, this is not a single line, but a long gun inserted into the abdomen of Rehe, grasping the traffic between North China and the Northeast, and sheltering the corridor between the Northeast and North China. After the ceasefire, the joint meeting of national and communist commanders was held twice through the Chengde, Chifeng, and Chaoyang three groups, but there were no results. Xiao Ke spent a lot of effort and twisted facts to argue for the issue of separating the two armies, from which we can see the elements of "ceasefire" and "peace" in the Communist army. The commander of the pacification zone, General Shi Jue, the commander of the 13th Army, is an old hand at fighting. Without saying a word, he first completed the disposition of "being invincible." As expected, in May, the Communist army gathered 17 brigades with a total of 100,000 troops and launched the "May Offensive," attempting to cut off the long array section by section and then eat them all up. Horrifying rumors spread among the people, and people in various cities panicked. After twenty days of fighting, the Communist army successively occupied Gushan, Beipiao, Chaoyang, Yebaishou, and Lingyuan. All communication and traffic were completely destroyed. The 13th Army exerted its power at various key points, and the Communist army's offensive was frustrated. In the seven-day battle of Gushan and the three-day battle of Beipiao, the price paid by the Communist army was its own heavy casualties. The people's panic was eliminated, and they believed in the national army. The news of these fierce battles has always been closed off. The officers and soldiers of the 13th Army did not complain. They had the spirit of self-sacrifice for the sake of anonymity, and the brilliant results in the suppression of the internal rebellion were not enough to boast about. After this lesson, the Rehe Communist army lowered its head to the 13th Army. It is said in the Communist army: "I would rather fight the ×× army once than fight the 13th Army once." This is the honest truth after being taught a lesson. The strength of combat power can only be judged fairly by the enemy. The Communist army broke the ceasefire agreement and besieged Datong. The national army launched a counterattack, and the Rehe side quickly recovered Chengde, Longhua, Pingquan, and Weichang, and then recovered Weichang, Duolun, and Gu Yuan in one fell swoop. The Communist army suffered heavy losses and fled in panic. The 13th Army must be solid in defense and victorious in attack, but it is not arrogant and condescending to the enemy. Their key to combat is: "Fight a rat like you would fight a tiger." Be steady, strike hard, pursue fiercely, and maintain a rigorous style.</p>
<p>The 13th Army is the main force in the recovery of Rehe. Their clothing is simple, their spirit is extremely full, and most of them are brothers from Henan. The entire army is full of a simple and honest atmosphere, and they are one with the people. The people love and support the loyal and brave army, helping them repair roads and letting them live in their houses. They do not want a single piece of paper or wood from the people, and there is no gap between the army and the people.</p>
<p>With this strong army stationed on the front line of national defense, the rear of the Northeast can be stabilized and the heart of North China can be secured.</p>
<p>In March of last year, an American B-29 Superfortress crashed on a peak of more than 14,000 feet in western Kang Province, and the pilot's life and death were unknown. The picture shows the Xichang Village where the rescuers spent the night on the way up the mountain to search. (Together with )</p>
<h3>Autumn Acts Like Spring in Wuxi and Changzhou</h3>
<p>— ·From Gao Wu Hong, Wuxi, 11th Day·</p>
<p>The days of "Autumn's End in Jiangnan" are fast approaching. As the "autumn" wave is about to depart, the reporter wishes to write a piece of communication that won't become outdated. However, it must be stated that this article combines Wuxi and Wujin, and does not write about them separately, to save space.</p>
<p>First, an anecdote: A month ago, the "sudden bloom of Lei flowers" in Qingyuan Park caused a small stir in Wujin city. In the past few days, on an open space behind the Wang clan ancestral hall in Wangjia Village, Henan, Xiahe Town, Third District, an apricot tree suddenly blossomed again, full of silvery-white flowers, emitting a burst of fragrance. The flowering of an apricot tree in autumn is considered a strange thing by everyone. The reporter once drove to observe it, but unfortunately did not bring a camera, and could not photograph the flowering situation, which is a real pity. The reporter heard the old painter Qian Xiaoan say: "The sudden bloom of Lei flowers and the autumn flowering of apricot blossoms are not good omens. The country has been in chaos for a long time, and it seems that the people still have difficulties ahead!" Hearing this in the sound of autumn wind and falling leaves makes people feel uneasy.</p>
<p>The Taihu Lake area has long been a place where bandits haunt, and the people suffer from banditry. The government authorities have repeatedly shown leniency, giving these criminals a new chance. However, those lawless desperados continue their mischief. The Jinghu Garrison Headquarters specially established a Wuxi Command Post and commanders of various suppression zones to first persuade and appease. If appeasement fails, they will be suppressed. After capture, they will be immediately interrogated and executed by military law. How can small-time bandits like Xiao Wei hope to contend with a mighty righteous army? The notorious bandit Li Defu, with new-style weapons, who roams across the borders of Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, and Qingpu counties, along with his henchmen Hou Mingqing and Luo Ying, were finally captured by the authorities during an encirclement because they refused to surrender, and were executed on the 16th in Suzhou at the Wang Shutun execution ground.</p>
<p>The internal ranks of the Communist army are also gradually wavering and disintegrating. Most middle and lower-level cadres with clear minds have realized that they were temporarily incited by ideology and became criminals of the country and the nation, serving as tools for the struggle of a few. Therefore, whenever they have the opportunity, they surrender one after another. Wu Sijian, the Communist Party commissar of Wujin, has surrendered to the authorities. Chen Xueliang, the "county head" of the Communist side in eastern Wuxi, has contacted Xu Yuanruo, the county head of Wuxi, and County Head Xu has given Chen a deadline of the 22nd to "surrender." For the few die-hard bandits, a full-scale military suppression will be carried out, with the aim of eradicating the bandit scourge in a short period of time and thoroughly pacifying the Third District, without any leniency.</p>
<p>Recently, Liang Hong, a native of Nantong who started as an apprentice and was the special commissioner of the Second District Committee of the CCP Central China Bureau in Xicheng, witnessed the Communist Party's plot to undermine peace and deceive young people. Moved by the Chairman's benevolence and the government's magnanimity, he led more than ten subordinates, including Zhu Dachuan and Luo Ye (female), to surrender and reform to the Wuxi Command Post, and issued a declaration of secession from the party, recounting the crimes of the Communist Party, and urging young people deceived by ideology to wake up as soon as possible. Attached to the declaration was the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party's instructions on work in Jiangnan, several thousand words long. Sections one and two distort and propagate the Chairman and the current situation. The following instructs the overall task of the Communist army and guerrillas in Jiangnan and southern Anhui, which is to mobilize the broad masses and actively launch mass guerrilla warfare. The war is divided into two types: (1) Assemble relatively strong main forces to conduct large-scale guerrilla warfare on the borders of Jiangnan and southern Anhui; if necessary, develop towards western Zhejiang, and at the same time establish larger, better, or smaller, more solid base areas. (2) In areas such as Taihu Lake and Maoshan, launch dispersed guerrilla groups, and in addition, in the vast Jiangxi area—areas where armed struggle cannot be launched—carry out mass work, develop the party's secret work, and boldly launch various forms of mass struggle.</p>
<p>From this incident, we can see the Communist army's ruthless means of disrupting the local area and undermining peace; at the same time, we can see how the middle and lower-level cadres of the CCP are wavering and uneasy within the party. The fate of the CCP is like the withered yellow leaves on a parasol tree. A gust of wind, a shower of rain, will scatter them all!</p>
<h3>The Battle for Senatorial Seats</h3>
<p>The election of Wuxi County senators will be implemented in the short term, and the number of seats has been allocated by the county government, but all parties have expressed dissatisfaction with the allocated numbers, and a fierce debate has been unfolding in the past few days. The free professional group was only allocated one seat. The journalists, lawyers, doctors, and other units to which the industry belongs all believe that it is unfair and have asked the county government to consider increasing the number.</p>
<p>The most heated dispute is between the County Chamber of Commerce and the General Labor Union. When the County Chamber of Commerce held its 18th meeting of directors and supervisors, when discussing the allocation of senatorial seats, it believed that: "All taxes and levies are mainly borne by industry and commerce, and the nature of regions and groups are different. Now, in a democratic era, the establishment of public opinion institutions is intended to seek reasonable representation from all regions and professions. If the number of seats for the elected is not evenly distributed, the Chamber of Commerce will have to give up participating in the election." The opinion at the meeting was unanimous, and they were willing to give up participating.</p>
<p>The General Labor Union believes that the number of seats designated by the county government for the labor union is only based on the membership of 26,000 when the union was established. Currently, the total number of union members has exceeded 40,000. According to the provisions of the latter part of Article 10 of the election regulations: "The number of senatorial seats shall be allocated in proportion to the number of members." Therefore, the number of senatorial seats that should be obtained should be increased. They insist that the county government handle the matter in accordance with Article 10 of the election regulations promulgated by the government, otherwise they will not participate. The Farmers' Association, which was allocated twelve seats, also felt it was too few, and actually held a meeting of directors and supervisors, creating a "rush" situation. The reason is: "The number of farmers in this county accounts for an absolute majority. The county government plans to have a total of 43 professional representative seats in this session of senators, and our association has only obtained twelve, accounting for less than one-third. We should ask the county to increase the number of seats to be reasonable."</p>
<p>The battle for senatorial seats has reached its extreme excitement in the past few days. A few days ago, someone sent a letter to the county government for reference, based on the Shanghai Municipal Senatorial Election Seat Allocation Method (which uses the number of township farmers' associations, industrial or professional trade unions, and trade guilds as the standard for allocating seats). However, the county government believes that this method is not explicitly provided for by law and is inconvenient to decide, and has reported the situation to the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions on how to handle it. However, the public is not concerned about the "dragon and tiger fight" of the farmers', workers', and merchants' associations, as if the election of senators has nothing to do with them.</p>
<h3>The Sound of Biao Hui Fills the Ears</h3>
<p>Due to the general economic downturn in society and the difficulty of life, the trend of "biao hui" (rotating credit associations) has recently become popular again in Wujin. Tea houses and restaurants are filled with the sound of "biao hui." Almost everyone is involved with "biao hui." The method of "biao hui" may be known to very few people. The reporter only recently understood it, so I will talk about it here: First, an individual initiates it (the "hui tou" or leader), inviting acquaintances, relatives, and friends to form a "hui." The number of people is not fixed, but usually at least ten. The "hui tou" sets a number, such as 100,000 yuan for the first round, so the "hui tou" can receive 900,000 yuan at once. From the second round onwards, a bidding method is used. Except for the "hui tou," who pays out a fixed 100,000 yuan each time, the remaining nine people write the amount they want to receive on a piece of paper, such as 500,000, 600,000, or 700,000 yuan. After collecting them, the bid is opened, and the person with the smallest amount wins the "biao." The "hui" money of the winner is publicly raised by those who have not won. The later the "biao" is won, the larger the "hui" money. The most cost-effective is, of course, the "hui tou," who receives a lump sum and pays it out in installments, without adding a single penny of interest. Therefore, everyone wants to be the "hui tou" and take advantage of it. So you "biao hui," I "biao hui," making a chaotic and unsettling mess. Some people even regard "biao hui" as a "way to make money" and are busy with "biao hui" every day.</p>
<p>"Biao hui" is also a form of disguised usury that exploits ordinary people. Some people want to do business but don't have capital, so they ask relatives and friends for help and "biao" for a "hui." However, with the popularity of "biao hui," the phenomenon of "running away with the hui" is also prevalent. Some people win the "biao" and then run away. Such disputes occur several times every day. The social atmosphere is shifting from stagnation to decadence, which deserves the attention of the authorities.</p>
<h3>Scenes of Hefei</h3>
<p>— From Dou Baiping, Hefei, 10th Day</p>
<p>The reporter had an opportunity to travel from Chaoxian County to Hefei City. For the convenience of transportation, I decided to go via Hefei and take in the sights of this temporary provincial capital of Anhui.</p>
<p>There are now water and land routes between Chaoxian and Hefei. Small boats go west through Chaohu Lake and enter Xikou to reach Hefei. For the land route, one can take a car along the Huainan Railway (when the Huainan Railway will be open to traffic is still unknown).</p>
<h3>Political Progress in the Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Hefei is a place the reporter has visited before. This ancient city, which has endured eight years of hardship, was a historically famous place in the past, and now it is also the political center of Anhui. After the victory last August, the capital of Anhui Province was moved from Lihuang in western Anhui. There was a fierce debate in Anhui about whether to set the capital in Hefei or return it to Anqing. Some people believed that Hefei was located in the center of Anhui Province, and the city was large, so the capital should be located here. Others believed that Hefei did not meet the conditions for being a provincial capital in terms of location, and that construction was beyond the financial capabilities of the province and local authorities, so it should be returned to Anqing as soon as possible. So this issue was submitted to the Provincial Assembly for discussion. The result was that it was decided to return to Anqing, but the relocation would be carried out when the provincial government's finances allowed. This means that in principle, it will be moved back to Anqing, but the timing is flexible.</p>
<p>Although the provincial government has been in Hefei for a year now, the market has not prospered. On the contrary, it appears desolate and lonely. The power plant has not yet been restored, and the alleys are so dark at night that it is daunting. The shops are not as prosperous as before the war. There is only one road in the city, which runs from the provincial government to Xiaodongmen. The rest of the streets, except for the commercial area around Gulou, which is paved with flat stones, are uneven and bumpy, making walking a real chore!</p>
<p>Since Chairman launched the "Reform Movement" this spring, it is said that there has been some progress in politics compared to the past, but this point is only true in the provincial capital. In the countryside of the outer counties, as far as the reporter knows, the effect is still minimal. This shows that lower-level cadres cannot take responsibility for the upper levels. For example, in the "Reform Movement," corruption is listed as a prohibited item. However, corruption in Anhui is probably no less than in other provinces. Among the county heads, many have fallen from office after being reported for corruption. Township chiefs in the countryside can strut around and arbitrarily collect taxes, and farmers dare to be angry but dare not speak out. This is the reality of the past and present.</p>
<p>Civil servants in various departments and offices in the provincial capital, on the other hand, have a frugal style. Most of them wear gray cloth uniforms and carry symbols issued by the institutions. Their faces show the pressure of life. If a mid-level civil servant has a family of four, then an income of 130,000 to 140,000 yuan is not enough to cover the expenses of food, clothing, and housing. Now the prices here are rising with the wind. Rice in Hefei has risen to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and pork and cloth are rising even more wildly. I don't know to what extent they will rise!</p>
<h3>Watching helplessly as they fall into debt</h3>
<p>Hefei currently has one provincial male and one provincial female high school, and one county high school. Most of the students come from nearby counties. In addition to tuition and miscellaneous fees, students pay for food entirely in kind. The total cost for a middle school student to enroll is 130,000 to 140,000 yuan, and at least 200,000 yuan per semester. Raising this point, there is a serious problem in the countryside, which is related to the education of the entire country.</p>
<p>After nine years of the War of Resistance, the knowledge level of our farmers has improved. They know that cultivating their children to study is necessary. Although the countryside is now in a state of bankruptcy, the children of farmers going to school, according to the reporter's estimate in several villages, is much more than before the war. In this situation, the problem comes. It is a well-known fact that the only income of the countryside is agricultural products, mainly rice, and the only source of tuition fees for children is this. When the school started this year, new grain was 10,000 yuan per dan. If a student needs 150,000 yuan to enroll, they have to sell fifteen dan of new grain. If a family of four receives a hundred dan of grain (in fact, there are too many people in ordinary villages who receive a hundred dan of grain), it is difficult to support themselves with the money needed for donations, food, pocket money, and even birth, old age, illness, death, and marriage. Adding the expenses of a middle school student for the whole year, they have to borrow money. And today, high interest rates are seizing the economy of farmers. In order to cope with the emergency, knowing that they are falling into debt, they have no choice but to keep moving downhill. This year, some farmers have already sold their grain cheaply for their children's tuition fees. Now that grain prices are rising, it is already too late, and now everything is rising, which only increases their burden of life. In this situation, farmers have the foolish desire to see their children become dragons, but in reality, they are limiting them from having this thought.</p>
<p>This is a problem that deserves attention. In the past, there were few literate people in the countryside, forming countless illiterates in China. Now farmers are consciously and actively eliminating illiteracy, but the burden of life is suppressing them. Is there no way for our country to eliminate illiteracy? We are an agricultural country. In the past, the foundation of the War of Resistance was in the countryside, and in the future, the foundation of national construction will naturally be in the countryside. Is there any problem more important than this?</p>
<p>During the war, civil servants were already complaining that they could not afford their children's tuition fees. Now, the reporter has seen with his own eyes that farmers are selling next year's food in advance for their children's tuition fees. Their children have entered school for now, but after this winter, they will have less to eat. How can they talk about studying then? This situation is truly chilling!</p>

<h3>With Science, There is Technology</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>In 1943, the author published an article in Chongqing entitled "From Technology to Science," explaining that the progress of the nation requires not only studying technology but also paying attention to basic scientific research. Now, I further elaborate on the importance of basic science in the atomic age to awaken the attention of the people.</p>
<p>The highest purpose of our research in science is not so much for "application" as it is for "seeking truth." The most important contribution of scientists lies in developing and promoting the human spirit of "seeking knowledge" and "pursuing truth." The so-called life of a scientist is "beginning with seeking truth and ending with seeking truth." The mind of a scientist is a rational mind. Why do I say this? Scientists must have six major principles to carry out their work before they can complete their task. Now, I will try to explain them: (1) Must be able to distinguish right from wrong, be able to observe precisely, love novelty but must pay attention to proof. (2) Be able to understand the results of observations, apply strict logic and controlled imagination to analyze clearly, synthesize systematically; and use experience to derive theories, and use reason to interpret experience. (3) Must continue to repeatedly consider theories and experiments; draw hypotheses from experiments, and then create experiments from hypotheses to seek proof, and combine thought and action. (4) Must adjust one's conclusions and concepts about scientific research at appropriate times, and revise the created theories at any time, because scientific theories progress from rough to refined, from refined to subtle, and should be revised at any time. (5) Need freedom of research, freedom of thought, and freedom of discussion. (6) Need to collect examples from various sources, and humbly refer to the results obtained by predecessors or peers, because science has no national boundaries, and no personal limits. It is the common achievement or harvest of human efforts to seek knowledge. The above six major principles should be strictly followed and carefully used in the study of any science.</p>
<p>The study of natural science has two major goals: (A) Investigating things to acquire knowledge, and (B) Utilizing things to enrich life. The former is to satisfy the desire for "knowledge" and to enlighten the mystery of the universe. It is the driving force for human beings to seek "truth," and it is absolutely devoid of economic meaning and transcendent, as mentioned above. The latter is to use the knowledge gained from scientific research to exert the effectiveness of matter, which has economic significance. Due to the different nature of the above two major goals, the tasks achieved are also different. Therefore, the direction of modern scientists' efforts can be divided into three major categories: (1) Pure science, (2) Applied science, and (3) Technology. "Pure science" is not entirely for material benefits, but to study "nature" from the standpoint of seeking "knowledge"; this is basic science. Its method focuses on objective observation or experimentation, and seeks understanding from the results of observation or experimentation. This understanding creates a "hypothesis"; this "hypothesis" may be temporary, but it is enough to represent people's understanding of natural phenomena at a certain period. "Applied science" can use the same methods to obtain the same knowledge, but its pursuit of knowledge is for "utilizing things to enrich life." Pure science and applied science are completely the same in some aspects, and the talents engaged in research also need the same basic training, but the final goals are completely different. Pure science seeks to make mankind "better understand the universe" and "closer to the truth," while applied science strives to "control nature" to achieve mankind's "material enjoyment." As for "technology," it can be said to be the practical application of the results or knowledge of pure science and applied science to complete a practical economic method to utilize the "material world." Therefore, scientific research is to acquire and organize knowledge, and technological research is only to use this knowledge to achieve purposes other than science.</p>
<h3>Basic Science is the Source of Technology</h3>
<p>Pure science (also known as basic science) is the basis of applied science, and applied science is the basis of technology. Knowing only to develop technology and applied science, but not paying attention to the basic research of pure science, is like only hoping for the flowering and fruiting of trees, but not cultivating the roots of trees. This will eventually lead to a day when flowers stop blooming and fruits will not bear! In World War II, the two most important inventions were "radar" and "atomic bombs." But if there were no "electromagnetic theory" of Maxwell, the saint of electrical science, which opened up optics and electromagnetics, recognizing the relationship between light waves and electromagnetic waves, and establishing the basic principles of electromagnetism, how could "radar" have been invented in World War II? If there were no efforts to study the pure science of "atomic structure" by Professor Bohr and his companions and students, and the basic scientific work of other physicists in breaking atoms with particles, discovering mesons, and using neutrons to enter the nucleus, how could the "atomic bomb" have been created in the war? Therefore, the Nobel Prize in Science in 1945 was awarded to Professor Bohr, which was indeed a well-deserved judgment. And the opening of the second battlefield in Europe had to be attributed to the progress of meteorology. In other words, the completion of "radar" and "atomic bombs" was at least the accumulation of more than half a century of human research in basic science, and then these two benefits were obtained in World War II. And fortunately, these two benefits fell into the hands of the United Nations, saving the "freedom" and "equality" of all mankind in the world. We cannot but admire the greatness of science, and we cannot but recognize the importance of studying pure science, and the mission and value of scientists in serving mankind. If in the next half century we do not strive to research pure science and accumulate this basic knowledge for use when needed, then applied science will inevitably remain at its current state and not advance. If applied science stagnates and does not advance, then we will not be able to make any progress in manufacturing cars, airplanes, ships, radios, and all kinds of manufacturing technologies and engineering technologies. Common people think that it is important to research and manufacture technologies such as cars and airplanes, but they do not know that it is even more important to research basic science! Especially in our country now, pure scientists are hardly valued by the people, which is truly a great crisis for the nation! Only the loud calls of scientists and those engaged in scientific work can awaken the attention of the people and the support of the government and society. Otherwise, our country will not only be a backward country in the atomic age, but will also forever become a country that is backward in science and technology!</p>

<h3>Using National Goods is Most Glorious</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>"Using national goods is most glorious" is the slogan formulated by the movement to promote the use of national goods. The originator of the movement was Mr. Hu Boxiang. At that time, this slogan was formulated after repeated consideration, because it had to conform to the principles of psychology and be practical, without any exaggeration.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, thanks to the efforts of all parties, "using national goods is most glorious" has become a well-known slogan to the general public. Because of the frequent mention of this slogan, it can be translated into action, and as a result, the sale of national goods can become more widespread.</p>
<p>For any movement, grasping the psychology of the masses can be said to be a core element. "Using national goods is most glorious" has already produced a beautiful flower in just a few months. We hope that in the near future, we can get abundant fruits.</p>
<h3>On the Efficiency of Textile Factories</h3>
<p>— Deng Shaoqiu</p>
<p>This article is an excerpt from the British Textile Industry Research Association's quarterly publication, "Improving the Efficiency of Textile Factories," by Hurdle. The full text is 50,000 words long. This is a concise translation to provide reference for research and those engaged in the textile industry.</p>
<p>(1) Machine Speed</p>
<p>In the textile industry, the speed, strength, and weakness of textile machinery are interrelated with the quantity of production and the efficiency of work. Low speed results in low output; in other words, work efficiency is also weak. However, the speed of machinery also has a certain limit. Too high a speed will reduce work efficiency instead. The speed of textile machinery must be determined by the size, quality, and grade of the fabric, the thickness of the yarn, and the size and number of shuttles. For ordinary plain weave looms around 40 inches wide, a speed of 180 to 200 (RPM) is most suitable. Therefore, the first step to increase work efficiency is to first ensure sufficient tension of the warp and adjust the speed of the machine.</p>
<p>(2) Sizing Process</p>
<p>In addition to the speed of the machinery, the sizing process is also extremely important. Whether the sizing process results in a good outcome is enough to affect the appearance and aesthetics of the finished textile, as well as the quantity of production and the amount of damaged cloth and waste yarn. The purpose of the sizing process is (1) to increase the strength and smoothness of the yarn, and (2) to increase the weight of the yarn to facilitate weaving. To achieve a good sizing process, one must pay attention to every detail, regardless of the difficulty of the various tasks. If the formulation of the sizing material is inappropriate or the method of harmonization is improper, it will not only be unhelpful to the fabric but also harmful and will cause endless difficulties during weaving. Therefore, the second step to increase work efficiency is to strive for excellent sizing results and to be familiar with the properties of compatible sizing materials.</p>
<p>(3) Warping Process</p>
<p>If the warping process is poor due to negligence, the fabric will be difficult to last and will be brittle and easily damaged. The inclusion of waste yarn will cause the yarn tension to lose harmony and uniformity. Therefore, the third step to increase work efficiency is to strive for perfection in the warping process. Otherwise, even if the machine speed is suitable and the sizing process is excellent, most of the fabric will be lost due to the warping process. At this point, even if one exhausts all efforts, it will be in vain.</p>
<p>(4) Warp Tension</p>
<p>The quality of the warp directly affects the production quantity and quality of the fabric, and indirectly affects the cost of production. If the warp tension is poor and the elasticity is insufficient, the warp on the loom will be subjected to sudden tension from the heddles and friction from the reed, causing violent shocks. Therefore, the fourth step to increase work efficiency is to conduct precise inspections of the tension and twist of the original yarn. For example, when weaving coarse cloth, use warp yarn of around 18 (S).</p>
<p>(5) Other</p>
<p>If one wants to describe in detail how to increase the efficiency of a factory, in addition to the above, other aspects cannot be covered in this short article. Even a thick book of more than an inch would not be enough. Therefore, to improve work efficiency, other steps are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(6) Uniformity of Yarn, (7) Temperature Relationship, (8) Warp Moisture, (9) Worker Skills.</p>
<p>The uniformity of the yarn is related to the warp tension, and the temperature relationship is also related to the warp moisture. If the temperature is high, the warp will be dry; if it is low, the opposite will be true. Dry warp is prone to breakage, while wet warp will shrink after drying when the fabric is finished. Therefore, the most suitable temperature for a textile factory is 70-80 degrees Celsius. Moreover, too high or too low a temperature is also detrimental to the health of the workers. Finally, the skills of the workers are naturally greatly related to the output and work efficiency of the fabric. This is something that everyone knows.</p>
<p>Finally, if the warp tension is sufficient and the sizing process is satisfactory, and all nine of these matters are rectified, then increasing the efficiency of the textile industry is something I can guarantee and be confident about!</p>
<p>The "Radar," a new invention of World War II, has been modified into a home machine.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Paper Production in the United States</h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>The paper shortage in the United States is expected to be resolved soon, thanks to the efforts to encourage the development of the pulp and paper industry in recent months.</p>
<p>Major production has increased, and all conditions are favorable for production. In 1946, the production volume for the first four months was 6,211,000 tons, with an annual rate of 18,630,000 tons. This exceeds the production volume of the same period in 1945 by 8.5%. The Domestic Commerce Bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that the supply and demand relationship for paper in the domestic market may return to normal by the end of the year.</p>
<p>However, regardless of how high the current production level is, the demand for paper and paperboard still exceeds the supply. The situation in the Pacific Northwest was the worst last winter. Heavy snow prevented logging operations for paper factories. Droughts and fires followed one after another. Fortunately, the production of papermaking wood began to increase in May. The production of papermaking wood and pulp in the southern United States accounts for 40% of the national total. The climate was equally unsuitable for loggers there. Due to heavy rain and flooding, work began in March. When the weather is good, it is easier to find workers, and work improved in April.</p>
<p>The greatest progress is that even American elementary school students know to collect waste paper, which also contributes significantly to the paper economy. Wartime patriotic motivations have been replaced by equally valuable peacetime goals. The money from the sale of waste paper is mostly used for school equipment, wartime orphans, or pediatric hospital wards. The collection of waste paper is truly astonishing. In April, donations from newspaper offices and government agencies totaled 656,000 tons, accounting for more than one-third of the paper and paperboard production that month, with a total of 1,635,000 tons.</p>
<p>The increase in paper production is partly due to price increases. Recently, the price of a ton of paper increased by $6.80, and it is said that it will increase by another 10%. The printing industry is in a bad situation due to the coal and transportation workers' strikes, but it is still increasing compared to 1945. For four months, U.S. consumption was 274,000 tons, or 17%, higher than in 1945 due to foreign imports and domestic production. Thanks to good paper sources, books, printing, and paper are more refined and excellent than before. However, the production of newsprint decreased in both May and June. According to industry sources at the end of July, the production rate of paper and paperboard in the second half of this year will continue to rise to 2 million tons, but domestic demand exceeds 2 million tons. Paper factories under construction hope to start operations in 1947 to meet the five-year needs. It seems that some exports will not be possible until 1948.</p>
<h3>Reader's Complaint</h3>
<p>A reader has written to state that the previously published "The Origins and End of the American Industrial Revolution" and "Discussion on the Location of Factories" were plagiarized.

<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Packaging and Transportation</p>
<p>Issue Seven of Production Organization</p>
<p>The packaging of goods must be appropriate, sufficiently strong, but not excessive. When designing packaging, we must consider the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Padding: When goods are placed in wooden boxes, there must be sufficient padding to provide adequate protection. When packaging goods, we must not only think about the current situation, because when the goods are being handled in the factory, people are very careful. But once they are on the road, they will undergo countless vibrations, so we must imagine the situation of the goods during transportation.</p>
<p>Many businesses abroad, because they ship a lot of goods every year, have specifically created a testing machine to test whether the packaging is strong. This testing machine is quite impressive. Its design is circular and can rotate. Inside, there are many uneven objects. Then, the packaged wooden box is placed inside, and the testing machine is started to rotate. After several rotations, if it is not damaged, then it can be said to be qualified. This method is indeed worth adopting.</p>
<p>(2) Size of Wooden Boxes: The size of wooden boxes must be in line with the economic considerations of transportation.</p>
<p>(3) Moisture Content of Wooden Boxes: If the wood of the wooden box is too dry, it will easily crack. If it is too wet, it will damage the goods. Therefore, the moisture content must be moderate.</p>
<p>According to experts' tests, it is said that if the moisture content of the wood is 15%, and it is tested immediately after nailing, the resistance is 100%. If the moisture content is 30%, then the resistance is only 90%. If the moisture content is only 5%, the resistance is only 50%. This shows that the most appropriate moisture content is 15%.</p>
<p>(4) Nail Issues: The length, size, and quantity of nails are all worthy of study, because they are closely related to the cost and sturdiness of the wooden box.</p>
<p>If a manufacturing plant ships a lot of goods and needs to use a lot of wooden boxes every year, then the packaging issue must be studied in detail, especially when the goods are sold in various places.</p>
<p>After the packaging issue is resolved, we must talk about the transportation issue. There are specialized transportation companies in various parts of China that handle transportation procedures. You can entrust them to handle the procedures on your behalf. They have established procedures and fees that you can follow.</p>
<p>But before resolving the transportation issue, you must first study the transportation routes. Should you use water transportation or land transportation? When deciding on the route and method, you should consider the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Which route is the most appropriate? (2) Which route is the cheapest? (3) Which route takes the least amount of time? Sometimes, if you have considerable sales in several places, it is better to ship the goods to one place first, and then distribute them from there (establish an office in that place, if the goods sell throughout the year, or it is more cost-effective to compare). This way, you can save more on transportation costs.</p>
<p>If the transportation affairs are complex, you can set up a special department to manage the transportation affairs. After the Commercial Press in Shanghai prints the books at the main factory, they need to be sent to various branch libraries. Therefore, they have established a distribution department to specifically be responsible for the distribution and transportation matters.</p>
<p>If the scale of a manufacturer is very large, then it can even recruit a group of transportation experts to organize a transportation company, to serve the factory on the one hand, and to accept external commissions on the other hand.</p>
<p>When discussing transportation, one thing cannot be ignored, and that is the issue of insurance. You must never calculate the insurance premium cheaply, otherwise, if an accident occurs, you will suffer a great loss.</p>
<h3>New Type of Industrial Glass</h3>
<p>— Lin Han</p>
<p>Science is constantly inventing, industry is constantly developing, and industrial products are constantly progressing. Many products have become outdated and even lost their former status as a result. But glass is different. Its position in the manufacturing industry may be maintained for thousands of years and will not be shaken.</p>
<p>Although the emergence of plastics has replaced the position of glass in some applications, causing people to only see imitation glass and ignore real glass, strictly speaking, due to improvements in glass manufacturing, its applications are increasing day by day. The future position of glass will not be greatly damaged. The following are the newly manufactured, widely used new types of glass:</p>
<p>In this war, the most significant and greatest gain in glass research was the successful manufacture of glass fuel tanks for industrial and laboratory use. Previously, it was thought that glass was too brittle and not suitable for use as fuel tanks. Now this shortcoming has been overcome.</p>
<p>Recently, a new type of glass has been invented. This type of glass does not contain sand, and its main component is phosphorus pentoxide. It is not corroded by hydrofluoric acid, which is completely different from ordinary glass. In the past, hydrofluoric acid was transported in lead or wax containers, and in laboratories, platinum or gold utensils were used to prevent chemical reactions. Now, it can be transported in new glass containers, which is much more convenient.</p>
<p>Gage glass is a special type of glass that has been developed over decades of research. It is not only very useful in wartime but also has a great impact on industrial progress in peacetime. Because glass gages are used to calibrate the horizontal lines of boilers that use steam power to generate light and heat in trains, ships, and other machinery. In the chemical industry, it is especially used in the oil refining industry to indicate the liquid level in pressure pipes and storage tanks.</p>
<p>Glass fiber. This type of glass was discovered before the 20th century. Now, it is appearing in new forms and with new names. It was previously called glass wool. It is a very fine fibrous glass that looks a bit like silk. A single fiber of this kind cannot be seen with the naked eye, because it is thinner than hair. It is commonly used to replace kapok as an insulator for cold, heat, electricity, sound, pests, and vibration, and for other wide industrial applications such as: winding underground oil pipes, gas pipes, and other metal pipes to prevent rust and electrolysis. Wrapped around pipes coated with tar or coal tar, it is durable and will bind even tighter after encountering water. When used on wires, it provides excellent insulation for motors, generators, transformers, etc. When manufacturing aviation gasoline (100 octane), glass fiber is also used as a filler in distillation towers.</p>

<h3>Life is Happiness</h3>
<p>Life is indeed a very unhappy affair, but it is not difficult to make it very happy. To achieve this goal, it is not enough to win the first prize in a lottery, get two hundred thousand pieces of cloth, or win the White Eagle Medal, or marry a beautiful wife, because these blessings are temporary and easily lead to a habit of coveting the excessive. If you want to feel the joy of life forever, even in times of sorrow, then the following two points are essential:</p>
<p>(1) You should always be satisfied with your current situation.</p>
<p>(2) When you encounter unpleasant things, take a step back and think.</p>
<p>If the matches in your pocket suddenly disappear, you should thank Heaven for not using your pocket as a gunpowder magazine. This will make you happy.</p>
<p>If an uninvited relative comes to you while you are taking a vacation in the countryside, don't be so angry that your face turns blue. You should be very happy to say: "How fortunate! It's not a policeman!" This will make you happy.</p>
<p>If a splinter pierces your finger, you should think like this: Fortunately, it didn't pierce your eye. This will make you happy.</p>
<p>If your wife or sister-in-law or sister-in-law is playing scales on the piano in a mess, don't lose your temper. You should pretend in your heart that you are appreciating music and not listening to a concert of jackals or cats. This will make you happy.</p>
<p>You should often think like this: you are not a horse pulling a cart, nor a rod-shaped bacterium, nor a trichina, nor a pig, nor a bear led by a gypsy, nor a louse. This will make you happy.</p>
<p>You should often think like this: you are not a prisoner standing in the dock, you are not dealing with your creditors; you do not have to discuss the issue of royalties with that editor, Mr. Tuba. This will make you happy.</p>
<p>If you live in a place that is not as far away as Siberia, shouldn't you think like this: given a small chance, you might be exiled there? Thinking this way, you will be happy.</p>
<p>If one of your teeth hurts, you should think like this: Fortunately, it's not all your teeth that hurt. This will make you happy too.</p>
<p>You should comfort yourself: I'm fortunate that I can't afford to read the "Daily Citizen"; I'm fortunate that I don't have to drive a garbage truck; I'm fortunate that I don't have to marry three women at the same time.</p>
<p>If you are sent to a police station cell, you should jump in happily, thinking like this: Fortunately, you were not pushed into a blazing hell.</p>
<p>If you are beaten with a birch stick, you should jump around with joy, shouting, "How lucky, I wasn't whipped with a thorn whip."</p>
<p>If your wife is unfaithful to you, think like this: She has only betrayed you personally, not your country. Thinking this way, you will be happy too.</p>
<p>This is a humorous essay written by Chekhov at the age of twenty-five, which was published in the 17th issue of the humorous magazine Oskolki. It is missing from Chekhov's complete works. It is now translated from the 941st volume of the Selected Works of Chekhov in the Wanrenye Book. There are no notes for editor Mr. Tuba and the Daily Citizen. The translator has no books at hand to check, so I have to leave it in doubt. —Translator's Note</p>
<h3>Autumn Window Notes</h3>
<p>— Hu Yingdong</p>
<p>The open space in front of the dormitory looks very desolate. Piles of withered grass and fallen leaves are being lit with fire by several wild children, making crackling sounds as they burn. Red flames and black smoke rise upwards, gradually turning into circles of smoke rings, skimming over the rooftops and disappearing into the sky. The season for burning wild fires is approaching. From here, I recall the days of living in Mist City. Every day, there was crimson fire, crawling like a snake across the plains and mountains. Now, the wild fire is burning all over the valley, and the soul of autumn is smiling. I use silence to praise the wild fire in my imagination, when I read the poets using truthful voices and emotions to sing the soul of spring to life.</p>
<p>Often, I stand on the corridors on both sides of the dormitory, looking at the distant scenery: that cloud mountain, that magnificent sea and colorful waterfalls washed by the setting sun, and the bald top of the church, the paulownia trees with fallen hair. All of this contains infinite tranquility. The appearance of nature is changeable, and autumn is an even more mature season, just like the graceful demeanor of a middle-aged woman. She hides the mystery of the season of time.</p>
<p>Dragging my heavy steps, I walk out of the residence along this small path paved with yellow sand, to take a walk in the fields outside, to hunt for some autumn flavor. Every day after dinner, I always make such plans with a belly full of contradictions, although I know that the feelings of the aging autumn will never bring me a trace of vitality.</p>
<p>The fields after the harvest are lying with lonely soil with grass roots. The soils seem to be sighing their fate. Their annual cultivation only reaps today's desolation. A few black, unknown birds fly over, peck at the field, and suddenly flap their wings and fly away with a rustling sound.</p>
<p>Everything contains mystery, everything is indifferent. I stare blankly at this desolate world in a daze. The harvested land everywhere exposes a year of scars and hardships. Counting the lonely heart, I silently walk towards home.</p>
<p>Under the white, translucent window lattice, let the light in the house shine on the window. The house is quiet, without a sound. Walking from the corridor into the house, and from the house to the corridor, the violin in the opposite dormitory plays out a tortuous love story, which makes me even more confused.</p>
<p>Dusk, a pale smile spreads outdoors. There is no moonlit night, but there is such dim light.</p>
<p>The shadows of the trees in front of the window dance in waves, reflecting on the milky white window bars. Black shadows are jumping, the light of the lamp, and the chaotic mood, accompany this deep autumn night, weaving into a pale yellow picture. The scene at this time makes me unable to forget the four difficult days I have endured, and makes me even more afraid to see the dancing phantoms in this real world...</p>
<p>The shadows of people remain, the table lamp shines with a peaceful light, and in the twilight, I hear intermittent cockcrowing.</p>
<h3>Bai Jiao Writes Orchids</h3>
<p>— Jian Qi</p>
<p>"Ming Dynasty people are most skilled at sketching in ink wash flower and bird paintings, but they are often concerned more with the idea than with the form in orchid paintings. It was not until Luo Yufeng painted orchids that the attention was paid to sketching and his paintings have become a good example. However, his paintings sometimes lack a sense of rhythm. Li Qingjiang's paintings have uninhibited strokes with a declining scenery and lack of spirit. This is not what we are talking about in the pursuit of capturing the spirit."</p>
<p>Someone asked about the way of orchids, and Yunjian said, "Flowers are easy, leaves are difficult; brushes are easy, ink is difficult; momentum is easy, time is difficult; form is easy, rhyme is difficult; momentum is achieved through speed without haste, brushwork is obtained, time is achieved through moisture without wetness, inking is obtained, form is achieved through unstudied restraint and natural posture, and a complete spirit is obtained."</p>
<p>"The quality of orchids values even shoulders. The paintings take a side view, just like in writing, avoiding a flat and straightforward narration. The orchid flowers are all painted with pointed petals, which also shows a lack of understanding of the valuable qualities in orchids."</p>
<p>Someone asked how to tend orchids well. Yunjian said, "First, don't ask about what is good." He said, "If one is already able, from whom should one learn from the past sages?" He said, "Who did the ancients learn from?" He said, "How does one achieve spirit?" He said, "Do nothing."</p>
<p>"When holding the brush high, the palm is empty and the fingers are flexible, the brush has lightness and heaviness, and the force is even." Someone asked Yunwen about the technique of writing orchids, and he told him this.</p>

<h3>Trivial Talks on Novels</h3>
<p>— Ye Zizhen</p>
<p>Sequel to The Plum in the Golden Vase</p>
<p>The author of "Sequel to The Plum in the Golden Vase," Ding Yaokang, styled Xisheng, sobriquet Yehe [Wild Crane], was a native of Zhucheng, Shandong, a tribute student who served as a teaching inspector in Rongcheng during the Shunzhi reign. He was later appointed magistrate of Huian but declined the position. Lu Xun's "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" states his dates of birth and death as "approximately 1620-1691." Zheng Jing's "Abstracts of Ten Rare and Fine Legends" (Yenching Journal of Sinological Studies, No. 24) quotes Ding's postscript in a Zhengde edition of "Collected Works of Li and Du," saying, "In the year Gui Si of the Shunzhi reign, I lived outside in a seaside village and borrowed it to read. In the year Jia Wu, I went to the Rongcheng teaching office, carrying it as a companion on my travels… Moved by this, I wrote this. Written by Ding Yaokang of Langya at the Pepper Pavilion of the guest quarters, at the age of fifty-six." According to this, Jia Wu was the eleventh year of the Shunzhi reign. If he was fifty-six years old then, he was born in the year Ji Hai of the twenty-seventh year of the Wanli reign. The "Zhucheng County Gazetteer" of the Qianlong reign, Volume 36, states that he "died at the age of seventy-two," which should be the year Geng Xu of the ninth year of the Kangxi reign. Therefore, his dates of birth and death should be 1599-1670.</p>
<p>"Excerpts of Old News on Novels" once recorded six historical materials related to Ding. "Historical Materials on Chinese Novels" added another one from "Idle Talks at Chibei." Several items remain uncollected in the two books. Wang Shizhen's "Miscellaneous Records from the Ancient Tianyuting Pavilion," Volume 5, states:</p>
<p>"Ding Yaokang of Zhucheng, sobriquet Yehe, was friends with Qiu Shichang, sobriquet Haishi, but they were temperamentally incompatible. One day, while drinking in the Tie Gou Garden (Tie Gou Xing from Dongpo's collection is located there), they disagreed on a literary point. Qiu drew a sword from the wall, intending to harm Ding. Ding immediately mounted a horse and fled. Ding wrote 'Tianshi'; his poems contain many remarkable lines, such as the old general saying: 'Lowering his head, he pities the warhorse; the setting sun is on the great river in the east.' The old horse says: 'The west wind brushes past both ears; one last look at the setting sun.' These examples are all striking. In his later years, Qiu became an instructor in Xiajin. Passing by Liangshan Marsh, he wrote a poem saying: 'The tale of Shi and Luo is timeless; Zhuo's title is even more lamentable. Today, Liangshan is but so; Heaven and earth will gradually lose their wonder.' Ding was appointed magistrate of Huian, and Qiu was appointed magistrate of Gaoyao, but neither accepted the positions." Ruan Kui-sheng's "Casual Talks After Tea," Volume 8 (Wang's version, commonly found in Volume 7), states:</p>
<p>"Qiu Haishi and Ding Yehe were both poets from Shanxi. Ruan Ting's poems of remembrance mention 'Poet Ding Yehe of the Nine Immortals' and 'Qiu Lingju, of equal fame, every day.' The two gentlemen were close friends since youth. One day, they drank together in the Tie Gou Garden, and they disagreed on a literary point, engaging in insults and abuse. Qiu drew a sword from the wall and chased Ding. Ding escaped, mounted a horse, and fled. Qiu could not catch up and returned. The people of Dong regarded it as a fine story." Zha Weiren's "Lotus Slope Poetry Talks," Volume 1 (Dragon Prestige Secret Book edition), also contains an account, the first half of which is the same as Wang Zhuo's "New Sayings of Our Time," Volume 6, and the second half of which is the same as "Idle Talks at Chibei," Volume 12, and is therefore not recorded here.</p>
<p>Ding's writings listed in the "Zhucheng County Gazetteer," Volume 13, number eleven. There is also "Chronicle of Escaping Calamities," one volume, found in Ding Shouchun's postscript to "Record of Loyalty Displayed." Of the eleven titles, all but "Tianshi" survive. The Peking Library also possesses "Essentials of Family Governance," one volume, and "Manuscripts of Mr. Ding Yehe," three volumes. Ding Shenxing's "Re-engraved Account of the Beginning and End of the West Lake Fan" also records the poetry collection "Qiyuan Grass" and the legend "Feifei Dream," "Xinghan Cha," two titles.</p>
<p>"Sequel to The Plum in the Golden Vase" is listed in the "Catalogue of Chinese Novels" as having two types: an old nine-line edition and a ten-line edition published by a publishing house. The eight-volume, fifty-four chapter old manuscript edition in the collection of Yanyan Zhai is suspected to be an abridged version. The Shanghai Qingyun Publishing Company printed an edition in 1933 that did not divide chapters, totaling sixty chapters, omitting four chapters from the original book, with some textual abridgements, similar to their printed "Ancient Version (?) of The Plum in the Golden Vase."</p>
<p>The Post Story of the Water Margin</p>
<p>Lu Xinyuan's carved "Huzhou Book" contains Yang Fengbao's "Qiushi Collection," Volume 1, "Afterword to the Lost Collection of the Nanshan Poetry Hall," which states:</p>
<p>"After the Ming Dynasty collapsed, scholars, worn out and unemployed, gathered to form poetry societies, expressing their feelings for the former nation and ruler. South of the Yangtze River, there was no place without them. The most prosperous were: in Dongyue, the area around Ningbo; in the Sanwu region, Songling. … Songling was the hub of boats and carriages in the southeast, attracting talented and heroic gentlemen from all directions, even more so than in Yuezhong, and the Jingyin Poetry Society was the crown of the Wu societies. Ye Hengzou of Fenhu was the leader of the society. … Now, examining the famous figures who joined the society, as seen in Hengzou's 'Nanshan Hall Collection,' we can outline the following: from Shaoshang, Fan Meiyin (Feng Ren), Shen Xueqiao (Zu Xiao), Jin Wancheng, Chen Yanyan (Chen) [listing forty-five people, omitted], dating its beginning to Geng Yin and ending in Jia Chen. … Hengzou's name was Jiwu, sobriquet Wudai Shanren. The collection consists of four volumes." While focusing on Ye's "Nanshan Hall Collection," it also touches upon Chen Chen, the author of "The Post Story of the Water Margin." Shen Tong's "Zhenze County Gazetteer" essentially summarizes this text. Shen's entry notes that Zhen's "Nanxun Town Gazetteer" 36 (Miscellaneous Records 4) quotes it. Hu Shi's "Preface to Two Sequels to the Water Margin," "Historical Materials on Chinese Novels," then records it from the "Nanxun Town Gazetteer." Geng Yin was the seventh year of the Qing Shunzhi reign, and Jia Chen was the third year of the Kangxi reign, which is the datable start and end of this Jingyin Poetry Society (Shen's text lacks the year of termination). As for the so-called "Later, the historical case implicated the society, and some members were punished by law, leading to the society's dissolution" (Zhenze County Gazetteer), it likely refers to Pan, Wu, and Jiang Linzheng in the Zhuang Tinglong "History of Ming" case.</p>
<p>Wang Yizhen's "Nanxun Town Gazetteer" contains two additional items that have not been adopted by "Historical Materials." One appears in Volume 29 (Writings 1):</p>
<p>"Chen Chen (Biographies): 'Miscellaneous Writings of Yanyan' (lost). 'Poetry Collection of Yanyan,' two volumes (not seen). The Dong Gazetteer says, 'Han Chunyu's poems and preface briefly state: "Sui Yan and I have never met, and only after his death did I see his poems and miscellaneous writings. I urgently sought his complete works, but they were scattered and difficult to obtain much of."'" The following discusses Chen Chen's affairs, omitted. Also, Volume 35 (Miscellaneous Records 3):</p>
<p>"'Nanxun Gazetteer' Chen Yanyan, Chen, a Ming loyalist. Han Chunyu's 'Recent Poems and Lost Collection' refers to him, concealing his name and reputation. His life's writings have also been lost, except for 'The Post Story of the Water Margin,' a playful work, attributing it to Song loyalists." The "Nanxun Gazetteer" was written by Shen Dengying during the Daoguang reign. The notes in Wang's Gazetteer indicate that the "manuscript exists," suggesting there is no printed version. Yu Yue's "Continued Excerpts from the Tea Fragrance Studio," Volume 17, likely selects excerpts from the "Nanxun Town Gazetteer" as well.</p>
<p>Currently, the historical materials on Chen Chen are mostly recorded from Han Chunyu's "Recent Poems and Lost Collection." Even the twenty-four poems by Chen recorded in Chen Tian's "Ming Poetry Records," Xin Qian, Volume 14, are also recorded from such selected editions. The two-volume poetry collection was noted as not seen by Wang when he compiled the town gazetteer during the Guangxu reign, making it even more difficult to obtain the original book when Chen Tian compiled the "Ming Poetry Records" in the late Qing Dynasty. If "Recent Poems and Lost Collection" could be examined, it would not be difficult to discover new historical materials on Chen Chen.</p>
<p>Record of the Dragon Boat</p>
<p>Qing Mao Xiangling's "Ink Remaining Record," Volume 4, "Pan Jiuxiang" entry, states that during the Kangxi reign, there was a Pan Shirong who traveled to Yangzhou and took a prostitute named Jiuniang. The prostitute had a marriage agreement with Wei Shao of Sanyuan, and she abandoned Wei. Wei, angered, was killed. The procuress received a bribe and did not pursue the matter. Later, Shirong had a son named Jiuxiang, who was Jiuniang reincarnated. Wei reincarnated in Datuan Town, living near Pan. He argued with Jiuxiang and was captured and taken to Pan's residence, beaten to death, and his body was destroyed. Wei's son sued the officials, who brought Pan's son and his accomplices to justice. It contains the following:</p>
<p>"One of the accomplices, somewhat literate, composed the novel 'Record of the Dragon Boat' in prison, which is still circulated among the villagers."</p>
<p>The name "Record of the Dragon Boat" is not found in Sun Kaidi's "Catalogue of Chinese Vernacular Novels" and is also not found in the "Catalogue of Suspected Titles" (Appendix 1). Even books that collect and record literature, such as "Textual Research on Novels" and "Technical Talks on Novels," do not list this title. However, the meaning of the term "novel" used by previous generations was quite broad, encompassing all vernacular novels, ballad narratives, songbooks, precious scrolls, dramas, and miscellaneous writings. The "Study of Novel Industries," "Textual Research on Novels," and "Talks on Novels" published in the early Republic of China all followed this pattern. It is difficult to judge whether this "Record of the Dragon Boat" is a vernacular novel, a ballad narrative, or a songbook since the original book has not been seen. We will leave it as a question. Even if it belongs to the category of ballad narratives, this title is rarely seen. It is suspected that this, like the "Record of the Earth Prison" (quoted from "Eryou" in the Sequel, Volume 5) and "Record of the Smoke Box" (quoted from "Wenju Excerpts" in the Sequel, Volume 1) cited in "Textual Research on Novels," is a local novel or narrative that was not widely circulated.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 75</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Not far from Sister Cui's house, I drove the car into a small woods by the side of the road and concealed it. Although there were still no signs of anyone on the road, fearing unexpected trouble, I walked along the sorghum fields by the roadside. Arriving at Sister Cui's door, I saw that the shop was already closed and the door was shut. A red paper was pasted on the door, reading, "Shopkeeper traveling far, business suspended."</p>
<p>Just as I was uttering a "Huh?" I suddenly heard a woman's voice inside, chuckling, followed by the sound of the bolt being drawn, and the door was opened a crack. I peered into the room, but it was completely dark, and I couldn't see anyone. At that moment, I heard Sister Cui's voice saying, "Come in quickly, Long; someone might see you outside!"</p>
<p>"What is this all about?" I said, grabbing Sister Cui's hand in the darkness and groping my way forward.</p>
<p>"This is what that little old man who came with you last time meant. He said the city is very chaotic and there might be fighting here, so he told me to close the shop for a few days and see... This morning, quite a few vehicles passed by, very heavy ones, but we didn't dare get up to look..." She called Tiger Brother "little old man." I don't know what she meant, maybe because he was "small in stature but big in wisdom"?</p>
<p>After crossing the small courtyard and entering the back room, I thought Tiger Brother would surely be inside, but who knew that only Sister Cui's mother came out to greet us, beaming and saying some lively things.</p>
<p>"Didn't you just say that the little old man came?... Where is he?" I asked Sister Cui.</p>
<p>"He came very early and went out again," Sister Cui replied. "He said you might come, so he told me to keep an eye on the door? I've been waiting for half this time."</p>
<p>"Didn't he say where he was going?"</p>
<p>"He's probably gone to the station." Sister Cui said, cocking her ear to listen, not stopping me from speaking loudly; "I heard a knocking sound, let me go see." Before long, Sister Cui indeed came in with Tiger Brother.</p>
<p>"Little Aunt," Tiger Brother shouted in the courtyard. Entering the room, he shifted uneasily and saluted me, saying, "Captain! Reporting." But his face wore an awkward expression.</p>
<p>Tiger Brother was, after all, still a twelve or thirteen-year-old child. He was indeed very experienced in some matters, but in terms of human relations, he was still a child. For example, at this moment, he called me "Little Aunt" for a moment because he believed that in terms of time and place, we had returned to our original relationship—Little Aunt and Tiger Brother—but upon meeting, he became hesitant again, thinking that he had already taken office and been commissioned, and I should be his superior, Captain, so he called me "Captain." He was probably a little confused, as if standing on the edge of public and private, unsure of how to respond.</p>
<p>"We are still 'Little Aunt and Tiger Brother,' and for now, we have both left our positions." I gave him a clear boundary. In front of Sister Cui and her mother, I asked Tiger Brother to tell me everything about his recent actions. He told the truth, and Sister Cui and her mother supplemented a lot.</p>
<h3>Two Letters — Regarding the Transliteration of Mozart</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ning</p>
<p>Letter One</p>
<p>Editor: After reading "Concerning the Issue of Transliteration in Music" in the Spring and Autumn section on the 17th, I feel that the argument is not entirely correct and would like to correct the errors. In the article, it says that the transliteration of Mozart should be "Mo Zha," with the "tt" silent, but this is wrong. Mozart's native language is German, and the pronunciation is approximately the same as the English pronunciation of Mo'tzart. The final "t" sound should not be omitted at all because German pronunciation differs from French pronunciation. Could it be that the author of the article is French and does not know German pronunciation! — Joseph</p>
<p>Dear Editor: In yesterday's "Spring and Autumn" section, there was a great work by Mr. Zhu Lixing: "Concerning the Issue of Transliteration in Music." Mr. Zhu strives to make transliterations faithful to the original pronunciation, and he goes to great lengths to research, which is truly admirable. However, the transliterations that Mr. Zhu gave us made me confused. Please allow me to raise them and ask Mr. Zhu for guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu transliterates Mozart as "Mo Zha" and believes that all other transliterations are wrong. However, as far as I know, (1) the "Z" here should be pronounced "　," but the "Zha" character in Mr. Zhu's transliteration has a "　" sound. (2) According to Mr. Zhu, the "t" character is silent and says that is with the country's law. However, language from the same family have never had so many silent letters (such as french). I don't know whether Mr. Zhu's is "奥语" or the one used in country。 If is said to be the case, come here, you are wrong!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu also transliterates Dvo as "Fu Xiake" and believes that his transliteration is "accurate and appropriate." He confidently states that "D" is silent. However, as far as I know, this "D" character has a sound. The diacritic symbol above and the accent mark above the also should not be omitted. He also says that "r" should be read as "j." In fact, the "I" sound in 渡希米 is unlike anything in english, I don't know which language Mr. Zhu's "j" character is referring to.</p>
<p>Transliteration is originally a troublesome matter. There have been heated debates over different opinions in the past, but they have never yielded results. What Mr. Zhu is now proposing is specifically about musical terms, and his so-called "music" refers to "Western music," so this problem should be much easier to solve because people who appreciate and enjoy Western music, as a matter of fact, will definitely have some knowledge of Western languages. I myself am a music student, and when I encounter "Mo Zha" or "Fu Xiake," I know what Mr. Zhu is referring to and will never be mistaken. Therefore, I feel that it is somewhat redundant for Mr. Zhu to confidently say that he is "accurate and appropriate" and to criticize others as wrong before he has made things clear to himself. — Incidentally, let me tell Mr. Zhu that although English is not Latin, Austrian and German are also not Latin!</p>

<h3>Selling Houses</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>It is said that the Central Trust Bureau has been ordered to sell the second batch of enemy and puppet properties. What was the result of the first batch of sales? No announcement has been seen, so the details are unknown.</p>
<p>It is also said that the reason why the numbers issued in the past few months have not increased is mainly due to the sale of enemy and puppet materials. The country is currently facing financial difficulties, and this method may not be a good policy. Unfortunately, it can only be seen as a temporary measure. Otherwise, the President of the Executive Yuan and the Minister of Finance would be very comfortable and would not have to spend all day deliberating and racking their brains because enemy and puppet materials are, after all, limited and will eventually be sold out.</p>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau is indeed having a considerable headache over this assigned task of selling enemy and puppet properties because, although they are sold, the original occupants cannot be easily moved out. Buyers cannot receive the houses, so they are naturally not very enthusiastic, and often no one bids. However, this is beyond the control of the Trust Bureau.</p>
<p>The measures of the authorities are contradictory and often lead to ridiculous situations. Taking housing as an example, on the one hand, they are complaining about a severe housing shortage and want to solve the housing problem for civil servants, such as allocating huge sums of money to build citizen's residences. On the other hand, they are driving civil servants and citizens out of their houses and preparing to hand over this batch of houses to speculators and merchants to exploit and squeeze tenants. It is truly unknown what kind of brilliant policy this is.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the current enemy and puppet properties are mostly occupied by civil servants who persevered in the eight-year War of Resistance in the rear and were poor and unable to produce gold bars. They are not prominent figures who can simply issue notes to allocate them. However, if they had gold bars (no matter how they were obtained), who would not want to spend it happily to buy a beautiful house? Moreover, it is said that properties occupied by agencies will not be sold for the time being. May I ask, what is the use of an agency if no one works there? If the people who work there have nowhere to live, how can they work? There was a house-grabbing movement in London. May the authorities carefully consider this!</p>
<p>Intelligence Test</p>
<h3>Are You Forgetful?</h3>
<p>— Lang Ge</p>
<p>Everyone's inherent memory capacity differs due to their different natural endowments. People who are naturally intelligent or have keen senses generally have stronger memories. Conversely, people who are naturally dull or have slow senses certainly have weaker memories.</p>
<p>Often, we can test the laughable forgetfulness of a person with a weak memory. For example, if I introduce a friend named Wang to a person with a rather weak memory, after a considerable period of time, when they meet again by chance, and Wang greets the person with a weak memory, he will feel confused and panic, and will not know how to address Wang. This is, of course, a very unfavorable defect in social situations. And especially in academic fields, we can observe how weak a scientist's memory is.</p>
<p>The same thing, a person with a weak memory forgets in a flash. But a person with a strong memory can retain it for a considerable length of time. Here, their difference in ability is displayed.</p>
<p>Everyone has memory, but can you know the extent of your own memory? Here is a scientific method to test the "breadth" of your own memory:</p>
<p>Use three sets of white paper strips, each set with six strips. Write different numbers of digits on the six white paper strips in each set, with the number of digits ranging from five to ten. That is, gradually increase the number of digits from the smallest five-digit number up to ten digits. For example, the six white paper strips in the first set are written as follows: the first strip has 68217, the second has 953648, the third has 4291537, the fourth has 52801746, the fifth has 409571392, and the sixth has 2147305988. The other two sets are the same as the first set of six, with five to ten digits, but the numbers written on them must be different from the other two sets.</p>
<p>Once the tools are ready, you can begin the test. First, prepare another blank sheet of paper and a pen. Then, pick up the strip with the smallest number of digits in each set, look at it, hide it, and after one second, write down the numbers seen on the strip from each set on the blank sheet of paper (no copying). Repeat this process until you have written down the different numbers of digits on all eighteen strips in the three sets. Finally, compare the numbers you wrote down for each set with the numbers in each set to see which digit number you wrote down incorrectly in each set of six strips.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to calculate the score. There is a fixed way to calculate the score. On the last ten-digit number on all three pages, try to check if what you memorized is correct or not. If the last three ten-digit numbers are memorized, then your memory capacity is ten, whether the numbers of nine from eight above have been memorized incorrectly. If all three ten-digit numbers are not correct, then check whether all three nine-digit numbers are correct, if all are correct, then your memory breadth is nine. The rest can be inferred by analogy.</p>
<p>If your memory range is ten, then your memory is quite amazing. If your memory range is five or six, then your memory is too weak. The average person's memory span is generally between seven, eight, and nine. Those who do not reach this number are truly foolish.</p>
<p>Do you want to test your own memory? This is a world-standard scientific test. If you are interested, you may wish to honestly test yourself and see what your memory span actually is?</p>
<h3>Jews</h3>
<p>— Yimin</p>
<p>Yesterday, I took a trolley bus to the west. There were two Jews in the car, one holding two Russian breads, and one holding a leather bag. After a while, the ticket seller came, and the Jew holding the bread said to his friend (the one with the leather bag) in English: "Please buy a ticket for me." His friend looked displeased and said: "If you are willing to share a bread with me, I will buy it for you. Otherwise, I am unwilling." The Jew did not say anything upon hearing this. After a while, he said again: "Let's just buy our own."</p>

Under the education of his mother and friends, he has published hundreds of short essays and stories. Many collections of poetry have been printed, and he has won thousands of dollars in prizes in various prize competitions, but none of his publishers know that he is disabled, let alone his suffering. He is currently starting to write a book, which is estimated to require more than two years of thought and writing.</p>
<h3>American Educator on American Education</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Professor Wang Zonghai, a renowned American educator, recently came to China from the United States and has been employed by the University of Shanghai to teach in the Department of Education. On October 21st, during the weekly meeting, Professor Wang attended and delivered a speech, reporting on the trends and directions of American university education in recent years, which was extremely detailed. The following is a translation to serve as a reference and comparison for contemporary Chinese education.</p>
<p>Curriculum System:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Great War, American training has focused on creating individuals capable of dealing with all aspects of society, cultivating excellent citizens with noble character and morals. Therefore, the course programs of American universities have been reformed. Former U.S. President Wilson once said: "College is for the training of general experience and mental discipline." Their universities are now operating according to this basic policy: regardless of the student's major, subjects such as "Economics," "Politics," "Religion," "Philosophy," and "Foreign Languages" are all compulsory, while the actual major courses are not studied until the junior year. To put it bluntly, which may cause some to doubt, American university courses are much shallower than those in China. Freshmen study analytical geometry, while calculus and differential equations are not studied until the sophomore or junior year!</p>
<p>Emphasis on Physical Education:</p>
<p>All freshmen must be able to swim. By the sophomore year, they must have a second athletic skill, whether it is soccer, basketball, horseback riding, or even golf. The goal is to prevent students from only studying and to cultivate a healthy physique.</p>
<p>Extracurricular Activities:</p>
<p>American schools often have only a little over a thousand students, but there are nearly a hundred extracurricular groups. There are also many student-run publications. In addition, there are weekly speech contests, concerts, or debates, allowing students to truly benefit from group education.</p>
<p>Advisor System:</p>
<p>On average, each professor is responsible for supervising the academic performance of eight students and guiding their daily lives. Students can raise any questions they have with their advisors, who will provide a satisfactory answer. This can greatly increase the feelings between teachers and students, with only respect and love, and no elements of dislike or fear.</p>
<p>Professor Wang's speech concluded amidst enthusiastic applause from the students. President Ling then stood up from his seat and shared his experiences and thoughts from his visit to several top universities in this ancient cultural city of Peiping two days ago. In the quiet atmosphere, President Ling said the following:</p>
<p>The first place I visited was National Tsinghua University. They had not yet started the semester. Although the auditorium and library were not damaged, the vast campus was covered in weeds. Although 500 people are now working on repairs, I doubt it will be completed by the end of October. Yenching University is adjacent to Tsinghua, with a campus covering 700 acres. They have already started the semester, but there are only 800 students, and their living conditions are very difficult. Every meal consists mainly of "w窝头 (a kind of corn bread)" which southerners find hard to swallow, with only a plate of salted radish as a side dish. The extent of the damage to the facilities is similar to that of Tsinghua, so Yenching University's funding is already very tight. As for the salaries of faculty and staff, the highest is only 250,000, and the lowest is only 120,000, making it quite difficult to maintain a meager living.</p>
<p>Peking University is the strangest of all. Unlike Tsinghua and Yenching, it does not have a fixed campus. The various colleges are scattered throughout the districts of Peiping, with the College of Liberal Arts as the center. The strangest thing is that there are only a little over 2,000 students, but nearly 1,000 faculty and staff. According to President Hu Shih, the level of education at Peking schools has generally declined by three years compared to before the war. In this year's enrollment of new students, Shanghai had the highest standards. Please think about what the education level is really like in Shanghai, and what American educational methods are like. President Ling's speech ended there.</p>
<p>Indeed, President Ling is one of the youngest university presidents in Shanghai. The University of Shanghai under his leadership is developing vigorously. We have also implemented the advisor system. In addition to intellectual growth, our school also pays attention to moral, physical, and group education.</p>
<p>President Ling has adopted the strengths of Chinese and American education and has great ambition to make the University of Shanghai a model for all universities in Shanghai, which is indeed worthy of praise!</p>
<h3>Passive Resistance</h3>
<p>— Chunliang</p>
<p>An elegant old gentleman drove his car into a narrow road and encountered a young man driving a car from the opposite direction. The place was narrow, and they could not pass each other. Only one of them could back out of the narrow road and let the other pass.</p>
<p>"I think," the old gentleman said kindly, "you should let me pass because I am much older than you."</p>
<p>"I won't give you an inch," the young man replied angrily. Then, he took out a newspaper and sat in the car leisurely reading it.</p>
<p>The old gentleman leaned back comfortably in his seat, his eyes satisfied as he looked at the surrounding scenery. "Friend," he finally called out, "when you finish reading that newspaper, could you lend it to me?"</p>
<p>The young man finally gave in.</p>
<h3>Postal Rate Hike</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhao</p>
<p>According to the report on the 23rd, the postage for ordinary mail will increase to 200 yuan from next month! I can't help but think that, indeed, apart from water and electricity bills and the salaries of public educators, there is nothing cheaper anymore. If the former is passed into law and allowed to be implemented, the remaining salaries of public educators can proudly claim to be the "only cheap things left"!</p>
<p>Although the long war has been won, due to inconvenient transportation and unrest in the countryside, I don't know how many people are still wandering as strangers in foreign lands! And for this group of people who are "away from their hometowns" and "unable to return home," the only thing they rely on to relieve their "homesickness" is a letter "reporting safety at home."</p>
<p>According to the current situation, 200 yuan is really not much, but for letters to other provinces, due to transportation reasons, they have to be sent by airmail. If the number is calculated proportionally, airmail may be 500, and air express may be 1,000! Eight hundred or a thousand legal tender may not be much to obese old men, but how can self-respecting public educators afford the cost of airmail?</p>
<p>The newspaper on the 20th stated that the transportation authorities have approved a five-fold increase, which has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. This allows the poor wanderers in a foreign land to breathe a slight sigh of relief. I hope that the legislative authorities will give it a discount so as not to leave the meager salaries of public educators feeling so lonely!</p>
<h3>Memorandum</h3>
<p>— Gang Wu</p>
<p>Being born is dangerous, and dying is painful. So people seek happiness in the middle of the road. The most violent and evil are still filled with worries and anxieties. Only abundant knowledge can give you true pleasure!</p>
<h3>City of Peace - United Nations Capital Side View</h3>
<p>— Jin Xia</p>
<p>According to statistics from January of this year, New York City has a total population of 7,768,000. Among these people, non-U.S. citizens account for more than 60 percent.</p>
<p>Jews account for one-third of New York's total population. The first foreigners to arrive in New York were the Irish. The Great Famine of 1840 forced them to cross the ocean.</p>
<p>The number of employees in the New York City government is greater than that of the entire Australian government. The number of police officers in New York is greater than the number of standing vehicles in Norway.</p>
<p>On average, the New York Police Department arrests one citizen every eleven minutes. New York is a city with the most disputes and crimes.</p>
<p>New York City is divided into four districts: commercial, residential, unrestricted, and undecided, each with its own scope that cannot be exceeded.</p>
<p>Residences all have flat, wide roofs that can be used for sunbathing, hosting banquets, and playing tennis.</p>
<p>The tallest skyscraper in New York is the "Empire State Building," which has 102 floors and 62 elevators. The distance that the elevators travel is nearly a mile, so it can simply be called a "vertical railway." To prevent dangerous accidents, air wells are installed under the elevators, so that even if someone accidentally falls, they will not lose their lives.</p>
<p>As a result of the consumption of 7.7 million citizens, New York produces 4,000 tons of garbage every day, an average of one pound of garbage per person. To maintain the cleanliness of the city, the city employs more than 15,000 street cleaners.</p>
<p>New York's street system is the simplest and most logical in the world, with street names mostly named in numerical order.</p>
<p>The "Chinaneh Nag" women's apartment on 78th Street is magnificent in architecture and fully equipped, with five or six hundred rooms, making it the largest women's apartment in the world.</p>
<p>In a day, the following things happen in New York: 275 babies are born; 34 people are killed by cars; 116 people get married; 4 people commit suicide; 1 person is murdered.</p>
<p>New York's Central Park covers 879 acres. Combining all the parks in Shanghai would not be half the size of it.</p>

<h3>Returned Student from Three Countries, He Siyuan</h3>
<p>— You Nan</p>
<p>The newly appointed mayor of Peiping.</p>
<p>The government recently issued an order to transfer He Siyuan, the chairman of Shandong Province, to be the mayor of Peiping.</p>
<p>He's courtesy name is Xiancha, and he is from Heze County, Shandong Province. In 1916, he entered the Department of Philosophy at Peking University and was a strong member of the May Fourth Movement. After 1919, he went to the United States, France, and Germany to study political economy, earning a master's degree from the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>He returned to China in 1926 and served as a professor of finance and economics at Guangzhou Zhongshan University. His political career began in 1927, starting as a member of the Central Purification Committee. In May 1928, he followed the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army to Shandong and was appointed as a member of the Shandong Provincial Government and concurrently as the Director of the Department of Education, a position he has held continuously to this day, a history of eighteen years.</p>
<p>Good at Coping</p>
<p>The situation in Shandong Province has been unique since the Northern Expedition, with extremely subtle relationships both externally and internally. The chairman of the province has been replaced by Sun Liangcheng, Chen Tiaoyuan, Han Fuju, Shen Honglie, and Mou Zhongheng, but He Siyuan has not only never been replaced but has also risen from Director of the Department of Education to Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and then to Chairman of the province. During the War of Resistance, he remained in Shandong throughout, showing that he is good at coping with complex and difficult political environments.</p>
<p>When Han Fuju was in charge of Shandong, He inspected the state of education in western Shandong as the Director of Education, arrived in Jining, and summoned elementary school teachers at the Education Bureau to give a speech. One passage in his speech was very witty and profound. He said, "Currently, there are three types of people in society that make people envious: The first type is the bandits who recruit soldiers and buy horses and occupy the mountains, who are famous and well-fed, but the common people gnash their teeth and hate them. The second type is those who have a 'Yang Guifei'-style younger sister who marries a so-called 'bureaucrat,' acting as a toy, and the older brother can use this mysterious and wonderful qualification to find jobs and seek positions easily, simply surpassing bachelors, masters, and even doctors and returned students. There are probably not enough trains to carry all the examples of this! The third type is a group of people who specialize in studying the art of flattering and using means to curry favor, gradually gaining positions and promotions. Do you think the paths of these three types of people are normal? Where is their personality to be found? Only the work of you all is the most sacred and valuable. Although it is difficult, you are establishing indelible achievements in society..."</p>
<p>Very Good at Talking</p>
<p>The above remarks are so straightforward and refreshing, and in the end, he places a high hat on the heads of elementary school teachers, which is of course very welcome. This also shows that the mouth of this returned student from three countries is indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>The current Shandong is a military conflict zone, and He is not of military origin, so it is difficult for him to display his strengths. Now that he has been transferred to be the mayor of Peiping, and Peiping is an ancient cultural city, a place where people and culture gather, I believe that He will definitely be able to develop his personal political aspirations.</p>
