<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕馬特使十三日下午二時飛潯八登廬山，將轉達山共方面建議召開軍事三人會議之意見，並定十六日偕馬夫人同返京。據有關方面稱：馬·司兩使仍在作最後努力，五人小組會與軍事三人會議之召開或暫擱置，現尙不悉，因馬。司兩氏日來亦正在硏究目前究應以何種方式最爲適宜。據聞，馬特使之意，如中共提議召開軍事三人會議商討停戰問題，則中共應接受非正式五人小組會商討改組政府問題爲交換條件，政治與軍事應並行商討。惟中共代表團發言人今日仍稱：目前切要者，仍在軍事三人小組會之召開，俾可解決停戰問題。至非正式五人小組會議，在停戰未獲保證前，中共將拒絕參加。</p>

<h3>第一個處死的日戰犯　酒井隆執行槍決　雨花台畔萬人爭看行刑</h3>
<p>— 本報駐京記者　張明</p>
<p>昨天我們親眼君到了一個曾經屠殺我們無數同胞的劊子手，在中華民國的土地上，讓國防軍的槍手，把他結束了。他倒在我們的面前，倒在刑塲四周滿山滿谷站立着的同胞們的面前，他是第一號被執行死刑的日本戰犯酒井隆，宣判死刑是卞九天以前的事，當時他還倔强的要申辯，十九天當中，還埋首在監獄裏，繕寫數千言的申辯書，富今天下午一點鐘，記者在他的監房外面探望時，他還在執筆書寫，神態很安逸，除了內衣外，沒有穿其他的衣服，眼鏡也取下了，桌子上零亂地放着東西，一盒中秋月餅，正伴着他。</p>
<p>正富記者在探望時，守衛的警上大聲的來問：「在做什麼？」他還說中國話：「不要緊，本要緊！」似乎還沒有知道死之將至。據戰犯拘留所內的警士說：他早已知道必有一死，但不知道是那一天，他常向警士們以手勢表示，生命將結束。二時半，軍事法庭陳檢察官光虞到了，立即發出提票傳訊，酒井聽到傳他的命令，馬上穿起歷次出庭時所穿的黃卡嘰襯衫，藏靑西服，黑底白點領帶，一雙黑皮鞋。到了法庭，是二時三刻，陳檢察官即刻訊問：「你的案子已經確定了，你還有什麽說？」答：「我在這裏沒有話說。」問：「你有沒有遺囑留給你的家屬？」答：「有，我已寫了，都是家事，一定要請送到，現在我還沒有整理好，現在是幾點鐘，最好今大讓我整理好，如果不可以，就算了！」陳檢察官說：時間不能等，最後答應給他三十分鐘的時間，就在法庭上書寫他未竟的遺書。到這個時候止，他的態度還是故作鎭定，由翻譯員說話時，還强作笑容，但是他又堅持要到監房裏去寫，並且說他的東西非常散漫。直等陳檢察官堅決不准允時，才搖頭，似乎這件事不能如願，死不瞑目之概。當筆硯各物取來後，他更以鎭定的態度，持筆而書，筆劃先細後粗，終至潦草到無法辯認，一張是給「岡村閣下」者，另一是給「酒井菊枝」的。起始都寫「九月十三日午後三時，突無刑死處行」，以下並寫留若干錢物等，因爲日文，草率不能認。書寫畢，再整理衣物，計皮箱一隻，包袱兩個，雖然死在眉睫，但是整理衣物認眞的態度，比遠渡重洋前整理行李還仔細，這種舉動，是充分表現了日本人的固執。</p>
<p>出發了，馳赴刑塲的兩輛國防部的大車？接着是記者們的小吉普。酒井的車上，警衛們的刺刀林立，從黃浦路經國府路，中山北路，達中華門，沿途這輛囚車，讓成千成萬的羣衆注視着，允其出了中華門，街衢民衆都奔集出來，指劃着這是一個罪大惡極的戰犯，囚在車上酒井，却仍以平閒的神態，不停的瀏覽一切，到達雨花台是四時正，滿山滿谷擁塞的是人，他們正以復仇的心情，期待着。酒井下車時，仍強作笑容，但滿臉堆着慘淡的色調，他的神情已讓死神迫緊了，到刑塲去的途上，他一雙始終在握的白手套，遺落在地。到達刑塲，執行人周文傑，舉槍從後面打去，第一槍後一秒鐘，再發第二槍，終於朝左向下倒去，兩脚分開，眼睛半開，嘴是開的，在幾聲呻吟裏，兩手向上舉起表示了求生的掙扎，這是最後一個節目。四點五分，他魂歸地下，羣衆的鼓掌聲在山谷裏響起，誰都是這麼痛快，如像爲自己的父母子女復了仇一樣。事後，雨花台的地保，命當地警局掩埋了他。這深埋在千萬人心底的仇恨，今天在第一個槍決的戰犯上，總算消除了一些。（十三日自南京發〕</p>
<p>酒井罪狀</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕國防部審判　戰犯軍事法庭公佈酒井隆之罪狀如下：案査戰犯酒井隆，參預侵略戰爭在香港，廣東各地縱兵屠殺俘虜，傷兵，及非戰鬥人員，並强姦，搶刦，流放平民，濫施酷刑，破壞財產等情，事實昭彰，罪證確鑿，業於本年八月二十七日經本庭依照戰爭罪犯審判辦法第一條，第八條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條，前段，華盛頓九國公的第一條，巴黎非戰公約第一條海牙陸戰規例第四條至第七條第廿三條第三項第七項第廿八條，第四十六條，第四十七條，日內瓦公的第一條至第六條，第九條，第十條，陸海空軍刑法第三十四條，刑法第一百零一條第一項，第五十五條，判處死刑，並呈奉參謀總長陳本月十三日代電節開「査被吿酒井隆參預侵略戰爭，破壞和平，並縱兵肆虐，違犯戰時法規，旣據審訊確實，原判依法科處死刑，尙無不當，經呈奉國府主席蔣電令指覆照准，希即遵照。即日執行其報爲要。）等因，奉此，遵即於即日下午四時，將該犯酒井隆一名提案，騐明正身，押赴刑塲，執行死刑，除呈報外，合行佈吿週知，此佈。計開：戰犯酒井隆一名，男，六十歲，日本廣島人，住東京。</p>

<h3>參政會下屆大會將在國大後舉行　兪交長在駐會委會報吿交通現狀</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕關於參政會下次開會日期，外間頗多猜測，甚至有謂在本届期滿前，將不致舉行者。頃據有關方面訊：參政會或將在國大之後舉行，蓋本届國大之主要任務爲制憲。而參政會爲民意機關，國大閉幕後，參政會再舉行一次會議，並無衝突。至開會時期，或在本年年底。參政員任期再度延長，亦非不可能。</p>

<p>宣言全文</p>
<p>（續昨第一版·完）</p>
<p>這一次大戰，是一個全世界性的反侵略的戰爭，我們中國實當了反侵略的前鋒，惟有我們中國以不計成敗利鈍的精神，堅持抗戰後始得促成反侵略國家之聯合，始得聲潰法西斯軸心强寇，始得爭取最後勝利的到來，我們自顧物質的力量，雖然遠比不上科學先進的友邦，但我們全國軍民不惜爲眞理犧牲的道義精神，實足以對全世界人類而毫無愧怍。我們是靑年，是爲建設新世界而奮鬥的三民主義靑年，我們祈求的，是這次戰爭的勝利，能產生國際的民主和合作，促成全人類四大自由的實現，然環顧今日的國際情勢，實使我們不勝其殷憂，聯合國在並肩作戰時所揭　的理想，所簽訂的大憲章，實猶未能於戰爭勝利後得着各聯合國家的奉信力行，在處理戰敗國和領土問題上，强國之問，往往把一國的安全重於國際的安全，把個別的利益高於集體的利益，由於互信的缺乏，减低了戰時合作精神，使世界重建的工作，遭受了深深不利的影響。這一年中間“菲列賓的獨立和印度臨時政府的成立，値得我們欣幸，但是許多有關國際和平的重大問題，皆未能收到完滿的解決，順利的進行，我們中國在反侵略戰爭中，本來犧牲最大，受害最久，乃在戰事結束以後，而民族獨立平等自由的地位，仍未獲充分的尊重，尤爲我們由國靑年所痛心。</p>
<p>我們想到「國必自侮然後人侮之」一句古訓，更不能不對於由國今日國內的情况，加以痛切的自我檢討，我們抗戰的目的，本在求民族的獨立生存，和國家的統一進步，我們是三民主義靑年，其一生職志，允在遵守國父和平奮鬥救中國的遺言，求得國家之統一，維護世界之和平，因爲我們深信，唯有建立一個統一强盛的中國，始爲東亞和平之根基，始爲世界和平之保障，可是勝利已達一年，國家的統一進步，竟然遭受着重重的阻撓，一方面則小國共產黨扶持其武裝暴力，不惜製造內亂，分裂國家，使社會經濟日益破壞，復員工作困難重重，一方面則貪官汚吏。土豪劣紳，以及一般發國難財，勝利財之奸商，肆其　厭之慾，以煽機物價，剝削大多數同胞，使戰後人民痛苦，無法可以解除，這都是三民主義最大的障碍，我們於痛心疾首之餘，認爲必須團結全國靑年，努力排除，然後可以克服今日國家之危機，然後可以使全國人民眞正能够享受勝利的果實，然後可以使中華民國永久保持其由於艱苦抗戰而得來的國際地位（下文從略）</p>

<h3>美本年對華貸款共六千七百萬元　進出口銀行向國會報吿</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕進出口銀行向國會提出報吿：顯示本年對華貸款前後六次，共計六千七百萬美元，第一次係對中國銀行之貸款，以協助該行購買美棉，其數為三千三百萬美元，足購美棉廿七萬五千至三十萬包，此一貸款之期限爲二十四個月，自美棉抵華之日起算，由中國政府祖保。其他貸放與中國之五次款項計共三千三百八十萬美元，係供中國在美國購買定量之船隻，鐵絲，及開採煤礦之修理器材及設備，輔助電力廠等，各次款項爲；</p>
<p>（一）沿岸貨運船隻十艘，計美金四百二十四萬三千餘美元；（二）貨運船隻十六艘，美金二百六十萬美元，（三）鐵路修理設備，一千六百六十五萬美元；（四）水力輔助電力廠十座，八百八十萬美元；（五）開採煤礦之設備，一百五十萬金元。</p>
<p>上述各批貸款之條件隨其用途之不同而異。購買沿岸船隻之貸款佔其售價百分之七十五，其餘百分之二十五價款由中國政府付現，此批貸款爲期二十年，利息三點五厘。進出口銀行在一九四六年四月間爲響應一九四五年十二月十五日杜魯門總統對華政策之聲明起見，特準備以五億美元貸予中國政府各機關及私人企業，但截至一九四六年六月三十日爲止，進出口銀行與中國政府代表迄未完成實行貸款之協定。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>跑馬廳的未來</h3>
<p>日來上海市民所共同注目的是：市參議會中正在討論的跑馬跑不跑的問題。據市政府交議案所估計，恢復跑馬，半年內稅收有二十四億元；但市長又說，他的意思只在想積存此款在二年內收回跑馬廳改作正用，乃「羊毛出在羊身上的打算」，並非想「奉承外國人」。惟其如此，可知跑馬恢復與吾，旣無關於中外的交誼，也與增稅彌補不足並無冬大影響，（市府預計半年不敷達三百餘億，決不能靠此二十億左右之歟額就可彌補過去，）而實應注重於市長收回跑馬廳的一項政策。</p>
<p>市長收回跑馬廳的政策，我們極端擁護。跑馬廳的應該收歸市有，理由很多，參議員諸君當亦知之甚詳，聞馮有眞趙君豪兩位參議員且已提議改建爲文化城。今後此南京西路邊綠之一大廣塲，將仍爲跑馬廳乎？或爲文化城乎？或爲大公園乎？或爲康樂廳乎？抑如市長所說，任令跑馬總會的地主各自售地建屋乎？市參議會應給市民一個回答！</p>
<p>但無論跑馬廳今後的運命如何，我們首須指出的，市政府在提交道個議案以前，其主管機關應先向市民說明下列各點：跑馬廳的歷史如何？跑馬廳佔地幾畝？其地產房產的產權誰屬？是否全部或一部原應屬於市有？以往歷年跑馬收人捐助慈善事業的經費，每年究有若干？受益者又是那些慈善團體的事業？政府如要收回，目前估値若干？政府除了准許跑馬以外，是吾絕無其他方法準備這筆收購的款項？</p>
<p>由一般人的心理來說：第一，在上海中區這樣一塊熱鬧地方，實在需要一個大多數市民游息的地方，鬧爲大公園也好，改爲文化城也好，但究竟不能再准在原處跑馬？市政府似應爲一般市民的健康着想，不能專爲幾個跑馬總會的洋商着想，更不必專打半年廿四億的算盤。第二，跑馬廳應歸市有，即應淸理產權，公平估値，籌款收購。第三，跑馬廳的改變用途，要以增進市民身心健康爲主旨，絕對不應再在該處建造許多里衖房屋，因爲在鬧市留出這一塊綠色地帶，也應該不可少的了。第四，說到跑馬，原本是運動之一種，但涉及買馬票，賭輸贏，那末是否要被認爲刑法上「賭博」之一種，應先求法律上的解答，吾則參議會貿貿然通過，豈不要冒一次險？大家須注意：上海市現在已經沒有租界了！中國的法律，中央的政令，總得先顧到；萬不可以爲租界時代有的東西，各國都有的東西，我們就不妨有！</p>
<p>確定民用航空政策</p>
<p>報載民營大華航空公司，以部發執照被行政院吊銷，致未能公開營業，而是項營業執照之核發，據說須待行政院及立法院通過民營航空法規後，始有希望，爲時亦將甚久。在此情形之下，該公司擬投奔香港，請求登記，以香港九龍爲基地，上海亦將爲主要停留站。正在這個時候，行總却以價値三百萬金元之航空設備，讓予陳納德將軍經營空遝，飛行我國領空，除載運救濟物資外，並擬兼營商客貨運。究竟大華航空公司是否計議向香港政府進行註册，以及陳納德將軍所經營之空運機稱，是否除載運救濟物資外尙擬兼營商客貨運，在沒有得到證實以前，我們不願有所論列。不過由於此項消息的判布，却使我們想到關於我國民用航空的政策，政府應該從速確定頒布。</p>
<p>在政府沒有決定民用航空政策以前，對於大華公司一案，我們所不可解者，即政府的舉措何以如此步驟不一？主管却可以發執照在先，而行政院可以吊銷之於後，此在公司方面，如有籌備和經營等損失，試問將從何取償？而且政府機關一方面紛紛與六華公司訂的，載貨運客，另一方面却迅雷不及掩耳勒令其停止營業，我們眞不知道我們的政府是一個整體不是？爲什麼這樣與一個民營航空公司開玩笑？</p>
<p>若說到民用航空事業，我們原知道即在祟尙自由企業的英美，亦採嚴格的管制。在英國，民用航空的經營，跡近獨占事業，不像其它一般企業，崇尙競爭。英國本土以幅員不大，民用航空事業，不如美國之發達，但海外空運的經營，幾全爲英國海外空運公司所獨占，受政府的監督與資助。在美國，民用航空亦何嘗不受政府的嚴格管制，關於路綫的核定及收費的釐訂，均須經民用航空局的核定，至於海外空運，聯美及西陸等航空公司的經營，亦無不受政府的監督管制。所以在民用航空的領域內，或採取獨占政策，或採取自由企業，但均須受政府的監督管制，固不能容許漫無秩序的自由競爭。我國民用航空事業，發達較晚，規模初具，此後對於民用航空，應該採取如英國那樣多少帶有獨占意味的政策呢？抑或應該取法美國，或參酌英美兩國政策，而另定與我國國情能够適合的政策呢？比際實在應該値須得考慮。</p>
<p>講到我國的工業生產及經濟基礎，自不能與美國相比，所以在空運事業的經營上，恐不能完全取法美國的制度。不過我國幅員遼闊，水陸交通不便，則民營空運的經營，於國於民，不能謂爲無益。即就大華航空公司經營以來機運頻繁而言，可知未必沒有需要。目今我國僅有民用航空公司兩家，而且所經營的空運路綫，大多彼此相同。我們目前所要決定的是否要讓這中航公司與中央公司兩家專營我國的民用空運？抑或於這兩家公司以外，再酌許別家公司經營空運事業，以競爭的方式策勵進步？如果採取獨占保護政策，則以往主管部發給大華公司執照乃屬應負錯誤之責。如果採取開放政策，則關於路綫的核定以及票價的釐訂等等，均須有嚴格的管制，而立法院尤應從速確定法規。我國的民用航空事業，正在發軔，我們希望政府對於民用航空事業，能够採取適當的政策，維護這種新興的事業，切莫拖延猶豫，使熱心於舫空事業的靑年們摸不着頭腦。</p>
<p>正義外交的倡導</p>
<p>在巴黎和會進入第七周的階段，我國代表于焌吉在義大利經濟委員會中宣稱，義大利雖曾於一九〇〇年所謂拳匪之亂後，自我國取得鉅額賠款，但我國不願向義索取此次戰爭之賠償。我國在對養作戰中之損失補償問題，將由中義兩國舉行談判解決之。于氏更就賠償問題，作一檢討，籲請各索取賠償之國家，勿作超出義大利給付能力之賠償要求。蓋以今日之敵國，即爲明日之友邦；設向被征服者索取過份之賠償，則將引起彼等之崩潰，此固非世界和平之道。「吾人必須有遠大之目光，俾贏得和平。」此一表示正足以反映我仁愛寬容的立國精神，是全國人民所一致贊同的。中國人民向以忠恕待人，不斤斤於計較得失；對表要求賠償的放棄，實是我民族美德最好的表現。</p>
<p>同樣的精神，不獨見於對義賠償要求的放棄，且見於我國對戰敗國所取的整個態度。在他遄離法京的前夕，王外長曾對來訪記者談稱，「和平如不能以正義爲基礎，即不能持久，所謂正義，即對弱小各國及戰敗各國均應保持正義。」關於我國對戰敗日本所抱之態度，王氏率直聲稱：「中國不信奉報復政策，中國予日本民主份子以援助，並准許彼等鞏固其地位。」從王外長及于焌吉代表的表示，可知我對外政策，以正義爲基礎，發源於仁愛。凡此，均爲我立國的崇高理想，而對外國策能與我立國精神相表裏，實在是一件足以欣慰的事。</p>
<p>的確，在目今這種國際形勢，猜忌懷疑似已成爲普遍的徵象；甚至嚴然以戰勝國自居，徒知扶殖卵翼，以備將來之患。在事實上，人類經過了兩次浩刦以後，儘管有原子彈的發明，在思想意識上郤並沒有如何改進。我國以文化古國，物質生產上縱趕不上人，但對於精神價値的認識，何甘落後？「正義外交」的提倡，在今日崇尙强權的時代，跡近空谷　昔；但我們放遠眼光來看，外交而無正義，何能贏得持久的和平？在今日的世界，我們更需要「正義外交」的提倡與實踐，必如此，纔能使人類免於未來戰爭的刧禍。</p>

<h3>完成中國和平統一維持門戶開放　華萊士闡述美外交政策　對蘇以諒解協調為基礎</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十二日電〕美國商務部長華萊士頃在此間發表演說稱：就世界和平與蘇聯之利益言，則世界和平需要中國保特超然地位，無論在政治或經濟方面，均立於任何勢力範圍之外，吾人堅持在中國一如在全鉅界、須將通往貿易與經濟發展機會之門門予以大開。華萊士繼續論及中國時，重申美國對聯合政府之希望，渠稱：除非有一統一和平之中國，並建於該國各團體之合作，且基於不干涉之政策上，否則在中國之貿易門戶開放，以及經濟發展機會，即爲無意義。其言辭可作各種解釋。</p>
<p>華萊士今晚之演辭，對於若干左派及進步黨自由主義份子，並非恰如其意，尤以共產黨爲然，因華萊士對於共產然在美國·南美·西歐之政治活動，亦作尖刻之說法。華氏稱：蘇聯在西歐·南美及美國，無庸煽動當地共產黨，一如吾人不千涉東歐及蘇聯者然。渠在其演辭中曾稱：蘇聯應停止傳佈渠等之共產形式，必須甚至在必要時，以武力勝過民主國家。同時，吾人應對吾人中欲吾人聽信蘇聯之共產主義，及吾人之自由企業制度，不能共存共榮者，掩耳勿聽。渠更作警語稱：蘇聯須知吾人並非計劃針對蘇聯之戰爭，而吾人確知蘇聯亦非進行藉各地之共產黨徒而擴張領土，或統治世界。有謂華氏之對蘇聯及共黨所發之言，乃爲對共和黨之宣傳攻擊民主黨政府討好蘇聯而發者。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十三日電〕美商務部長華萊士，頃在此間獨立職業委員會召開之會議中發表演說，主張美國採取不偏不倚之外交政策。略謂，紐約州長杜威最近發表演說，以英美聯防爲言，余以爲不然。美國不應依賴原子炸彈而與英國締結軍事同盟，任何人信賴原子戰爭者，遲早必受其害。英國在近東之帝國主義，和以蘇聯之報復政策，將導致美國直接捲入戰爭漩渦。除非美國制定其自身之明確與現實的政策，乃可避免。和平之代價，不能以金元估計，美國應派遣技師及放出信用貸款，協助其他國家之工業化，允其是對中國與印度爲然。美國目前採取保護貿易政策，實屬不當。以對蘇關係而論，吾人一面與從前之軸心國友好，一面與蘇聯斤斤較量，實爲下策。一般反動份子曾堅信軸心國之勝利，此際向美國表示友誼，然而若輩仍努力培養美蘇間之戰爭，若輩並不眞正歡迎美國，徒欲使美蘇兩國互相摧毀而已。吾人務須認識美國之不顧問東歐事務，猶之蘇聯之不顧間拉丁美洲事務。對蘇諒解與協調政策，應爲美國外交政策之基礎。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十三日電〕杜魯門總統昨日宣稱，華萊士之演說，主張尊重蘇聯之精神，余基爲贊同，華君之主張與貝爾納斯國務卿推行之政策，並無抵觸云。</p>
<h3>對華萊士演說倫敦深表驚異</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕杜魯門總統今日宣稱，完全贊同商務部畏華萊士在紐約發表之外交政策演說，其內容與國務卿貝爾納斯之意見並不相左。惟此間外交當局紛紛揣測此次演說，將有遠大影響。外交界注意力之集中點，厥爲華萊士主張坦白承認美蘇兩國勢力範圍之存在，及以此爲根據，設法對蘇成立協議。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：英外部發言人對美國商務部長華萊士之演說，深表驚奇，而社魯門總統顯然贊同華氏之見解一點，允足重視。該發言人不明華萊士所稱之「英帝國主義」，究應作何種解釋，當今英承認印度獨立及英軍如期自伊朗撒退之時，英蘇之間實無發生戰爭之任何傾回。</p>
<h3>戰時軍事合作英美保持不變</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕杜魯門總統今日披露，美英兩國之戰時軍事合作，暫時並無變化。總統今日接見新聞記者，或問，是否能假定聯合參謀團將　續存在至正式宣佈，戰爭已結束爲止？總統答：「當然」。接聯合參謀團係美英兩國高級陸海軍將領組成之團體，曾聯合計劃及進行第二次世界大戰。</p>

<h3>趙祖康報告工務　一年來工作本「應急建制」實施</h3>
<p>上海市參議會上午舉行第七次會議，由工務局局長趙祖康報告工務局施政情形，謂本局職掌道路·溝渠·房屋·公園·橋樑·碼頭·河道·堤塘八項工程，接收一年來感覺在數量與質量方面均感不夠，全市道路長約一千公里，三百多公里為柏油路，餘為煤屑石子路，其質量及佔面高度均不夠標準，根據中央頒佈之市政建設法令，道路面積應佔全市面積百分之二十，上海全部面積為八百九十平方公里，照中央規定道路面積應再加十倍。溝渠方面污水溝渠與雨水溝渠，共應有一千八百公里之長度，現亦不夠。房屋方面上海有四百餘萬人口，七十萬戶，全市至少應有五六十萬幢房屋始夠支配，而現在僅有三四十萬幢，於抗戰時期南市閘北又被燬三萬餘幢，至其數量更感不足。公園方面，現全市有公園十四，約佔千餘畝面積，依人口及全市面積計，亦至少應加十倍。橋樑方面，上海共有六升七百座，重要者有二百餘座，而浦江上尚無橋樑架設。碼頭方面大都屬於私人及洋商所有，而市府所屬僅有二十餘座。河流方面，分為四等，第一等河流為黃浦江，蘇州河，蘊藻浜，二等河流有十六條。堤塘方面，西塘自虬江碼頭起往北以迄賓山尚無危險，東塘自黃浦江口草頭庵起至川沙縣黃家灣止大部潰毀。總之，本市工務工程數量不夠，而復經八年淪陷，損毀尤多，至本局工作之困難情形，為一，溝渠道路無組織。二，破壞太厲害。三，圖卷不全。四，技工缺乏。五，材料購置困難。六，限於經費。</p>
<p>至一年來之工作實施情形，總而言之，所做者為「應急建制」四字，應工程上急迫所要做之工程及建立工務上各種基本制度，根據以往情形，並希望參議會協助工務局增加經費云云。</p>
<h3>工務局職員有貪污行為　遲延發執照索取通融費　議員紛紛提出質詢</h3>
<p>趙局長報告甫畢，參議員趙仰雄即提出詢問二點：（一）「房荒，曾記得趙局長於臨時參議會中允許建築平民住宅三千幢，所需經費由農民銀行墊付，但一年後之今日，僅造成一百四十五幢，與三千幢之數目相差何太遠，當時趙局長曾計劃多向國外訂購活動房屋，現已購就多少？搭建於何處？（二）為馬路積水問題，本市一經大雨，地形較低之馬路頓成澤國，本市為國際都市，實有失體面，且於市民尤大不方便，故洩水工程，必須克服一切困難於短期內完成。並附帶請求迅速拆除南市等處敵軍所遺留之障礙物。趙參議員標準國語，說來清脆動聽，詢畢獲得全場掌聲。金鴻翔起發言，痛訴各局長對應辦未辦之事務皆推諉於經濟困難。金參議員稱事在人為，國父創立民國，蔣主席領導抗戰，艱難困苦，不言可喻，經費之缺乏原可想見，終底於成，盼今後報告少稱經濟困難。金參議員語畢，全場一片掌聲，以示擁護。繼為馬少荃與孫震春提詢在今日房荒嚴重聲中，工務局對房地產業中請建造房屋非唯不予方便，且處處留難，馬舉例稱：林森中路建國路口空地，該地業主某地產公司已設計建築房屋三十餘幢，圖樣送局修正後，建屋執照於六星期後始發給，因建築有時間性，被工務局延遲六星期後，則全部工程今年不能完竣，諸如此類情形極多，有已九星期而尚未發執照者，反顧前租界時期，設計圖樣審閱後，最多不出二星期，即可發給執照，現工務局職員有意延發執照，其用意殊可懷疑云。孫參議員更補充稱工務局之發營建執照時，有需索通融費等貪污行為，全場對此驚人之語，頗表關注。</p>
<h3>各局報告不夠坦白</h3>
<p>三民主義青年團上海支團部幹事費樹聲參議員於詢問前發表感想稱：各局長之報告不夠坦白。並提問四點：（一）工務局對修筑馬路，防汛工程應有具體計劃，限期完工，（二）局中職員有無貪污情形，若有如何處置？（三）中正中路（舊福煦路）曾經修理，但被雨水一沖，旋又損毀，是否有偷工減料之弊？（四）房荒如此嚴重請調查有無操縱等情。陳麟生參議員代郊區市民呼　，請從速修長浦東大道路面及橋樑，並稱：現市政當局忽略郊區，僅注重舊租界區，然郊區地域七百倍於舊租界區，居民佔全市三分之一，目前郊區之建設較舊租界區衹少落後五十年，盼今後市政當局，多注意郊區建設。路式導馬君碩對平民住宅各有責詢，（一）市府公地甚多，為何最近建成之平民住宅，建於偏僻地區？（二）據估計每幢最多值二百萬元，何售三百萬元？可否出租？綜合諸參議員訊問大要可分：（一）房荒與平民住宅，（二）修築馬路，（三）馬路洩水工程，（四）郊區交通。各參議員之訊問極為踴躍，因時間有限，潘議長於十一時二十五分宣佈暫停詢問，先請趙局長答覆已詢問之各點。</p>
<h3>趙局長逐一答覆</h3>
<p>趙局長即步入發言台，逐一答覆稱：洩水計劃已擬定，法華浜已疏渚一部份，現法華浜南碩徐家泄區正興工中。唯經費困難，而物價高昂，一公尺水泥管值二十五萬元，全市溝渠全長五百九十公里，即修理一小部份，已所費不貲，馬路翻修亦限於機器材料與技工不能暢所欲為。平民住宅原價每幢僅值一百四十八萬元，另加小學（平民住宅區附建有小學一所）路基，水電等附屬工程，全部費用每幢平均為二百二十八萬元，若第二批再建造時，恐非三百萬元不辦，故經市政會議，通過每幢定價三百萬元。南市閘北區臨時工程現已著手整理，然基本工程必俟路線計劃配合都市設計擬定後，始可動工。至於南市等區障礙物，因警備司令部囑暫緩拆除。至營建執照由主管處主管科發放，如無地權糾紛，路線設計皆無問題，則即可發照，若有貪污等情，可請檢舉，必予嚴辦。過去曾有二職員舞弊，立即末即開除。並云　草浜橋半月內可完工，山西路橋先修理，福建路橋則暫緩。最後又稱現本局施政為應急與建制，應急為標中之標，建制為本中之本，並盼參議會多加督導，趙局長答畢已正午十二時潘議長宣佈散會</p>
<p>馮桂芬</p>
<h3>公用局施政報告　趙曾玨分述六點</h3>
<p>公用局長趙曾玨，昨日下午報告本年四月至八月間之施政，分電力，給水，煤氣，交通，電話，輪渡六項。提出如何消除本年十月至明年一月間，可能發出之電力恐慌，解決滬西給水困難，增加煤氣供給，管制中區交通，添設各區電話，增購輪渡等問題</p>
<p>電力問題</p>
<p>電力係全上海動力泉源，為一切市民所深切關心。戰前上海電力共達二十六萬　，戰後，浦東全部損失，閘北及南市損失百分之七十，外商電力公司損失者，亦達百分之二十五。去年接收時，即感電力恐慌，外商及閘北電廠，積極修復，但送至美國修理之機器，因受美國罷工影響，需明年二月始可修理完成。目前上海電力，有三分之二係供工業用者，供給紗廠者最多。將來計劃完成大上海環形供電網，一切皆標準化。關於電價調整，全市一律化，係屬錯誤。蓋將來上海電力公司，法商，閘北，浦東電力公司，皆各自發電時，因條件不一律，電價不應相同。目前全國電價，以上海為最低。</p>
<p>給水問題</p>
<p>目前滬西區最為嚴重，因滬西住房及工廠增加，比戰前多一倍餘，公用局積極籌備，設立滬西自來水廠。</p>
<p>煤氣問題</p>
<p>英商煤氣公司每月供給三百五十萬立方英尺，約有二萬多戶使用，但還不敷所需，解決辦法一為緊縮使用量，二為採購揮發性強之優等煤。目前煤氣公司不僅供給煤氣，同時供給焦炭及柏油。將來徜改用外國煤，煤氣價格或需調整。技術委會正在計劃設立高壓煤氣網，五年內完成。</p>
<p>交通問題</p>
<p>中區交通問題極為困難，而且非辦公室中之計劃所可解決，必須實地研究癥結之所在。中區交通之解決，需要同時解決其他各區之交通問題。希望參議會幫助解決中區交通困難。晴天時，上海人有百分之六十五在馬路上走，約為二百七十萬人。需要一千六百部公共車輛，始克解決交通問題，目前僅有四分之一。目前計劃，注重打通南北交通，車行路線須平均，鬧市及較冷僻所在皆須經過，電車公共汽車打成一片。</p>
<p>電話問題</p>
<p>目前交通部電信局管理南市，虹口，閘北及市中心區之電話，舊兩租界迷宮電話，則為美商電話公司經營，故通話有時困難上海需要效率極高之電話網。現已由電話局，公用局，及美商電話公司，各派二人組織委員會，（由趙局長召集）討論全市電話問題。決定以北站為中心，十公里半徑圈內分成四區。將來中區電話改成六個號碼。</p>
<p>輪渡問題</p>
<p>戰前輪渡共十四艘，目前僅八艘，且一艘在修理中。每月乘輪渡者達一百廿萬人，而戰前不過五十萬人。因人數故秩序欠佳。擬以企業方式，擴充輪渡業務，組織輪渡公司，配合卡車運輸，建設浦東倉庫，繁榮浦東。</p>
<p>最後，趙局長稱：徜以外匯收購外商公用企業，只徒增外匯消耗，外商以此筆頭寸至日本，香港，印度等地設廠，對我國並無利益云。</p>
<p>楊明暉</p>
<h3>市府徵收捐稅　議員看法不同</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於市長交議案中提出增加房捐及舉辦市政捐二案，前日已由第三組審查委員會初步議決徵收市政捐而不增加房捐。據記者昨日再向若干議員徵求意見，朱參議員文德認為市政捐為仿照前工部局時代之辦法。對於徵收市政捐並不反對，但沿用舊辦法是否妥當，值得考慮。陳參議員存仁，楊參議員撫生，對市政捐之表示：如政府確用於市政建設，而有具體方案者，則亦不反對徵收。趙參議員棣羣及張參議員一渠均反對增加房捐，因易於刺激物價而影響市民整個生活。但造成徵收市政捐，蓋市政含有建設性，乃市民應盡之義務。</p>
<p>屬參議員樹雄及王參議員維　則主張增加房捐，其理由主要者因房捐乃直接稅，徵收手續便利，而能使富者多收，貧者少收。沈鼎意見：若要求增加捐稅，必須明白其用途，市府超支者大部為人員開支，則人員之編製如何，市府須先確定，使吾人知道，工作計劃亦須先拿出來，以憑將來查對。</p>
<h3>接裝自來水要國幣開路　趙曾玨答覆質詢尚待調查</h3>
<p>公用局長趙曾玨報告完畢後，即開始口頭質詢，因時間關係，未及質詢者，延至今日上午補行。馬少荃所質詢之關於裝置自來水問題，最為精彩。馬氏為解決房荒，建築新屋，請求裝接自來水，達三星期，尚無結果。最初為馬氏友人告渠謂，上海一切事情，皆講「生意經」，必須「國幣開路」，馬氏乃不得不化小費二十萬元，但歷時三星期，仍未接通。而且據說，倘不化小費，計算水管裝接費時，往往大兜圈子，其實，即可山附近水管接上，結果所耗更大，需時更久。馬氏除加以質問外，並稱公事拖延時間，徒增製造勒索機會。並問能否於五小時內將水管接通？趙局長之答覆，殊為簡捷，謂請求裝接自來水，手續極繁，至於詳細實際情形，調查後當由書面答覆，以後當特別注意云。</p>
<p>鍾玉良質詢稱：第六號市輪渡，修理達十個月之久，迄今尚未修好，不知何日可以修好，何日可以行駛？各總工程師，副工程師，練習工程師以及工程師等，做些甚麼？據答稱：該輪係自海軍方面接收者，內部機器皆已失蹤，後登報尋訪，始自江南造船廠方面尋獲，唯所缺零件甚多，因係德國制造，配購困難，皆須自製，頗耗時間，至於人事方面，與戰前略同，唯業務方面減少八人。技術方面增加八人而已。</p>
<p>陶廣川問：（一）南市電燈光，極為黯淡，能否改善？（二）每晚十時以後，早晨六時以前，南市電話往往一二小時也接不通，如何改進？（三）電車，公共汽車，擁擠及秩序混亂，如何解決？（四）裝電話困難，能否多設立公用電話，或添置私人電話之分機？（五）當局定於二年後取締人力車，對未來交通情形，有何計劃？趙局長答稱：南市電話極力求合理化之解決，該區電話係屬交通部電信局管理，交通部與市府處於平等地位，市府僅能隨時通知，無權管轄。公共車輛擁擠情形，逐漸可獲解決。秩序不佳，確屬武裝同志不守秩序，以致善良百姓大受影響，極盼諸位參議員，於輿論方面多多呼籲。關於取締人力車，係中央命令，已有公文達市府，謂十月後還不取締，即屬違抗命令。</p>
<h3>汽車牌照·職員受賄</h3>
<p>張志轉詢：報載公用局為發展本市交通，曾向海外訂購公共汽車四十輛，運達後因不適用，須加改裝，但改裝費超過車價，遂另購新車，此事應由何人負責，現在如何解決？又據傳公用局下級職員受賄，曾將若干偽方之汽車號碼卡抽去，以便購自偽方汽車，可以重新登記。不知當初公用局接收時，汽車號碼卡是否完全？答稱：公用局並未向國外訂購公共汽車。關於汽車牌照事宜，嚴密注意，請大家檢舉，倘有不法，決定嚴辦。現在一方面嚴懲貪污，同時並獎勵廉潔。上海乃一有錢有勢之社會，若干人利用金錢勢力誘迫，亦請社會多多注意。</p>

<h3>電車到站不停　督促公司注意</h3>
<p>翟　參議員稱：有幾個輕鬆問題：（一）電車排除，請憲兵協助，糾正不守秩序之武裝同志。（二）目前電車站，對於乘客極不方便。（三）電車到站不停。（四）電話累進收費，不合理。答稱：電車站即將調查，電車到站不停，督促各電車公司注意。電話費累進制。寓禁於微，減少通話閒雜。</p>
<p>其他質詢案，略述如下：公用局之電車籌備處，係計劃補充，改進本市交通不合理情形。英商無軌電車，現有九十輛未能駛用，因無像皮車胎。法商公共汽車，十月底可到二十輛。公用局每月增加一條公共汽車路線云。</p>
<h3>候補參議員要求發言　內政部電覆未允所請</h3>
<p>市參議會在未舉行本屆大會前，曾接候補參議員楊志千等十餘人函，要求列席發言，該會因是項要求與中央規定不符，特電請內政部核示，頃奉內政部復電，按原規定辦理，未允所請，並抄錄內政部代電如下：「上海市參議會未哿代電悉，應按照院電原解釋辦理，內政部民佳印」。</p>
<h3>教育社會局今日施政報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會今日議事日程，上午第姓次會議由教育局副局長李熙謀（局長顧毓在歐）報告，下午第十次會議由社會局長吳開先報告。今日大會中除議員質詢及局長答覆外，尚有公用局長趙曾玨繼續答覆未完之質詢。並將選舉代表五人，參加蘇浙皖接收工作清查團。</p>
<h3>收回跑馬廳　改建文化城　馮有真趙君豪提議　產權問題　大會已請土地局調查</h3>
<p>路馬問題已成為市參議會興趣集中之問題，預料該案提出大會討論時，將發生激烈之爭辯，據記者探悉：記者公會產生之參議員馮有真趙君豪，昨向大會提出收回跑馬廳全部房地產，改建上海文化城案，建議將跑馬廳全部房屋場地收歸市有，改建有意義之文化中心，稱為上海市文化城，以樹開發建設上海之百年大計，並先成立上海市文化城建設委員會，由參議會推若干委員並聘請中外知名之士共同計劃，該城分為三大部分：（一）設參議會，（二）文化中心，所有本市文化學術團體如圖書館，博物館，革命史料陳列館，以及新聞記者公會，市教育會，文化美術團體，歌劇院等，均蔚集於此，（三）闢廣場為羅斯福運動場，以紀念美故總統羅斯福之豐功偉績，使市民多得一鍛鍊體魄之所，聞該案已有參議員數十人連署贊同云。</p>
<p>又吳市長交議之恢復上海塞馬問題，頗為各界所注意，市參議會中討論非常熱烈，尚未定議，惟跑馬廳之產權，究竟如何，參議會為明瞭確切真相起見，特函請市政府地政局縝密調查答覆，以為討論賽馬問題之參考云。</p>
<h3>警察總署長唐縱　昨參觀消防表演</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察總署長唐縱，前日蒞滬視察市警局各處科後，昨晚又參觀消防總處表演救火，地點在江西路市府大門前。先有警員林立，照料四週，復有消防處課長葉斌勇佈置一切，並殷勤招待各報記者解釋消防處各情甚為詳盡。七時五十分許，唐署長由警局副局長余叔平，消防處長周兆祥等伴同到場，表演節目遂即開始。先有浦幫車三輛由江西路南來，駛抵目的地。繼有雲梯二輛，搖梯二輛，照明車二輛，救護車一輛，救險車一輛，護布車一輛，先後到達。各消防警士往來如織，各司其事，或攀登雲梯，達一百十尺之高。照明燈七座，照耀如同白晝，一面由警士持巨大龍頭紛向市府二樓，射水灌救。路側預置房屋一所，內部煙霧迷漫，由演員設法開啓窗戶，由預套防煙具之警士越窗而進，將室內悶倒之人救出，舁上救護車，駛往醫院療治，各警士訓練有素，行動敏疾，至八時十分一幕精彩之表演，始告完畢。</p>
<h3>房屋租賃管理規則　調解不成強制執行</h3>
<p>馬君碩認有分割司法權之弊</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕在此房荒嚴重時期，房東房客之間糾紛尤多，市府當局因此特制定一新法規，名「房屋租賃管理規則」，已呈行政院備案，同時曾於前日提交參議會第十組審查。茲據馬參議員君碩昨語記者稱：審查會對此案，將予鄭重研討，蓋此項規章內提及，市府於調解不成後，可強制執行，實則根據法令，此點有分割司法權之弊。緣執行權乃屬司法機關，行政機關無權執行。此項規則，現在南京擬試辦一年，但上海與南京情形又不相同，市參議會既有權審查市府法規，對此規則，實有考慮之必要。</p>
<h3>大會通過議案　決參加清查團　人數問題造成增至五人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日來在參議員造成和反對下而沒有結果的「參加蘇浙皖接收工作清查團」問題，總算在昨日大會上解決了三分之二。一百三十八個參議員中有一百十五人造成參加，在沒有付表決以前，潘議長先報告清查團長張知本因為見到報上要他來商量，所以不等電報去請，就趕了來，經過議長和他接洽後，他已決定把工作期限延長到月底，同時出可以請參議員三位參加。</p>
<p>接著莊鶴　的意見得到了一片熱烈的鼓掌聲。他說：一般市民對於我們的期望很大，我們如果不參加，怎樣能不使市民對我們表示失望，要是我們有辦法不使市民失望，那末不參加也無所謂。講到人選方面，假若要參加的話，每一個參議員都有資格，但在若在過去一年中與接收工作有關係的人，都不能參加。我本人是上海市黨部執行委員會宣傳處長，也是和接收工作有關係的，就沒有資格參加，市黨部本身就是被清查的一個機構。這樣就要說到馮參議員前次提議新聞界推詹文滸參議員，我覺得很不妥當，因為詹參議員是中宣部的接收人員。我們應該推與接收工作絲毫關係的人去參加。</p>
<p>馮有真聞之認為言之有理，就說他上次提議推律師，會計師，新聞界各一位，既然詹參議員也是接收人員之一，那末對這一點正式推翻，提議請趙君豪參議員參加，趙從未參加過任何接收工作。</p>
<p>一波方平，一波又起，議員們對於參加人數一點，又發生了不同的見解。何元明和張中原等都主張五個人參加。張中原並說一定要有二個商界的人，但姜懷素覺得五個人不太妥當，議長既然和張團長說好三個人，現在又要改變，還得再去說，是否答應呢？</p>
<p>這時候議長說話了：如果一定要五個人，也可以再去說，同時並不規定要會計師，律師，和新聞界的人，任何人都可以被推出來。不過先要問一點，假如張團長不答應去五個，那是不是根本不參加呢？這一問可沒有人能確定的回答了。張中原說這事很重大，三個人不夠。張志韓則堅持工商兩界一定要有人加入。</p>
<p>最好的辦法是付表決。結果六十七個人造成派五個代表，造成三個人的共二十二票。但按到會人數一百卅人來計算，六十七票未過半數。路式導提到組織條例了，翻谷氨酸市參議會組織條例，裏面第十二條明白規定：「市參議會非有全體參議員過半數之出席，不得開議，非有出席參議員過半數之同意，不到決議，可否同數時，取決於主席。」這意思就是六十七票不能決定。</p>
<p>無形之中，這個大會人數需要正確統計了，秘書處人員緊張了一番，發覺在場議員一共衹一百十七人，原來有十九人中途退席了。「中途退席」！張志韓非常機靈的提出：「議事規則草案中第六條指明會議時退席應向主席報告，退席人數不應該除去。」議長也笑了，衹能說：「有幾位曾向我請假，有的沒有，現在人也去了，沒有辦法。」最後贊成五個人的勝利了。可是選什麼人呢？有人主張請議長提名選舉，省得麻煩。但議長的意見是：「今天時間來不及了，決定明天發選舉票選舉。」話還未說完，全體議員一致鼓掌代表了口頭的「贊成」。</p>

<h3>美兵偷影片　俄人收賊臟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美海軍港口司令因楊樹浦總部連續失竊十六耗電影放映機三具，影片二部，曾致函請求警局予以緝捕，經派外事股長王晨負責偵查後，業於前破案。主犯三名，係該部士兵名霍華司，喬哈納司，亞迪其，經訊問後供認竊盜不諱。上項臟物，已出售於業理發匠之俄人霍蘭芝，年四十八歲，住林森路九二一號，及業工程師之固達立，住亞爾培路四九〇號一〇四室，計得款一次為美金三百元，一次為美金五百元，出售地點在外灘水上飯店門口。現三美軍士兵已交美憲兵領問訊辦。該二俄人則以收臟罪定今日移送地檢處辦理。</p>
<h3>售票員擊傷警官被捕　英商一二路電車怠工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行駛靜安寺至愚園路中山花園之二十路無軌電車第三五〇號車，於昨晚八時許駛至中山花園附近，該處男女乘客擁擠異常，爭欲搭乘該車，長甯路分局有巡官張德森王紀鋼劉啓雲三人，均衣便服，亦隨眾登車，張王兩人先上，劉啓雲正擬跨上車時，詎司機滕立生（號碼九六〇）將鐵門關閉，經張巡官語伊尚有一人請其開啓，不料有賣票王國華（號碼一一八五）將門開後關，致將劉之腳踝軋痛，頓生口角，賣票王國華竟持扎票之鐵鉗猛戳劉之左眉一下，洞穿二穴，張德森亦被其用鐵鉗去臂肉一塊，三巡官乃將司機滕立生賣票王國華一併帶局請究。事後其他一二路電車工人聞訊，即行怠工。</p>
<h3>監禁獄中德間諜嫌疑犯　控告美記者誹謗案開審</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國合眾通訊社前曾發表在華德人沈克及其他納粹份子二十二人所犯之戰爭罪行。沈克因間諜罪將在美國軍事法庭受審，刻監禁於上海監獄中。此人近向上海地方法院提出控訴，指合眾社中國分社主任侖德爾故意誹謗。地院於昨日下午四時開庭，沈史之代理律師姚　第向汪家竹推事聲稱：侖德爾誹謗其當事人之名譽，曾於四月十六日由合眾社向上海及國外報紙發出一專論，刊載於上海字林西報。申新兩報亦載有此項消息。內稱沈克任納粹最高司令部之秘密活動被派往重慶，刺探重慶地下工作人員在沿海各城市活動之情形，以及美國與其他聯合國人員潛入自由中國之路線。姚律師聲稱：其當事人不惟可以駁斥此等控訴，並能證實被告所發消息之毫無根據。渠認為侖德爾犯中國刑法第三百十條第一二款。（按第三百十條第一二兩款規定處二年以上之徒刑，或法幣一千以下之罰金）。姚　第律師繼即提出一證件，據稱係中國前駐德大使現任駐拉丁美洲大使陳介所書，內認沈克為中國之友人。渠並謂可提出日本佔領期間上海區中國地下工作人員領袖蔣伯誠與吳紹澍之書面或口頭之證據，說明蔣吳兩氏曾與沈克會晤，且曾討論當時之局勢。至此侖德爾即為其本人辯護，認為對於中美兩國俱為敵性國之國民，竟敢在監獄中因一美國記者報道美國陸軍調查員之官方公告而提出控訴，對於法庭及渠本人均屬一種侮辱。侖德爾提出美國陸軍懷念部於四月十五日所發表之公告一則，內稱沈克表面上喬裝為反希特勒與親華這新聞記者，而事實上則為德國最高司令部訓練有素之秘密人員，曾以有關日本人之消息，與若干中國人交換有關中國軍隊分佈之情報。重慶之慘遭猛烈轟炸，與此輩「效忠雙方」之德國人向日本所提供之報告，極有關係。侖德爾並提出另一證據，即美國駐華陸軍司令部對外聯絡組所發表之文件一種，其中指出一九四五年五月八日至八月十五日間，沈克曾在上海刺探有關美國及其盟邦之軍事行動，報告日軍。侖氏要求法庭將該案撤銷，但汪家竹推事未准，並宣佈延期至九月二十三日再審。侖德爾指出美國軍事法庭將於下星期一開審納粹秘密活動份子，相信九月二十三日沈克或不能出庭。</p>

<h3>會場花絮錄</h3>
<p>三十一區區長鍾玉良，是參議會中最引人注意的一個趣味人物。此公光頭，蓄東洋鬍子，身穿香港衫，短褲，而他嗓子之響亮，確可以「驚天動地」四字來形容。他而且富於表情及動作，發言時，左右顧盼，一會兒緊張，一會兒笑嘻嘻。一會兒高喊一會兒低呼，在場不笑的人大概找不出幾個人。說話也極為幽默，他說工程師那末多，連得一條輪渡都修不好。工程師不是有總工程師，副工程師，幫辦工程師，練習工程師，戴帽子工程師，不戴帽子工程師等等許多名目麼。</p>
<p>馬少荃說他好意協助解決房荒，化了許多本錢，預備造房子，那知工務局發張執照耽擱了六星期。請公用局接自來水到工場去，又二個月沒　音，馬連說：「我倒霉人」。他說局方延遲不辦的原因，大概有二點：（一）故意的，那末非「國幣開路不可」，（二）技術人員不夠。</p>
<p>工務局分送參議員文件最為週到講究，其中最名貴者乃每人最新上海市大地圖一份，此地圖在戰後之上海，尚屬少見，高七呎一吋，闊五呎，打開來有似大被單一條。</p>

<h3>裕通製鹽公司經理詐財　收受貨欵二千餘萬私做拆放頂進房屋今日解地檢處訊究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕業已退伍之陸軍中將李嘯　，年五十八歲，山東人，住吳淞路三五六號，於本年三月間，經友人介紹向延平路三三五弄二號裕通製鹽公司，訂購食鹽二千担，鹽價連同運費關稅及什項等，共計二千五百八十萬元，雙方於簽訂合同後，即由李全部付清貨款交與該公司經理吳耕莘（又名芝楣年五十二歲，安徽人），詎吳見財起意，竟將該款私自存入銀行拆放生息，並頂北四川路志安坊二十四號房屋一幢，一面諉稱已派職員周棣華赴徐州海州產鹽區，分批採辦，及合同期滿，又偽造書信電報，謂該處時局不靖，致裝運遲緩，後因日期過久，乃再偽造書信一封稱，鹽已裝至漢口，囑李派人前往押運來滬。迨李派員往漢時，忽又稱尚在徐州，如是往返，結果均屬子虛，李忍無可忍，乃向吳嚴重交涉，吳仍藉詞請示再予展期，並付還鹽價四百八十萬之同潤錢莊存摺一只，嗣後即避不見面，至此李知受騙，乃據情報告警察局派課員張長貴會同至北四川路志安坊二十四號，將吳拘獲，當場抄出銀行存款支票以反偽造之信件印鑑等甚夥，惟吳在警局供詞，仍堅稱確曾派員携款一千六百萬元至徐州海州兩池採購食鹽，旋因該員逃往共產區，致到期不能交貨云云，及經警員出示偽造之信件印鑑等原底後，始無詞對答，直認詐欺不諱。至詐得之款，除頂屋化去四百萬元，拆放三百十萬元，揚州鄉間拆放一百三十萬元，大陸銀行存款六十萬元外，餘款業已化去，惟經警局偵查結果，復在山陰路淞雲別墅三號李新吾處吊出借款二百萬元，現該案業已偵訊完畢，定今日移解地檢處審訊云。</p>

<p>上海私娼最多的地方，大家都知道是在西藏路新世界一帶，每天太陽還沒有下山，便站滿了無數鉛粉和胭脂揉在一起的妖魔鬼怪，成為我們這個遠東最大國際都市的奇觀之一。這些地段是老閘分局的轄境，分局長施思兼終於痛下決心，動手清除。七月份查獲無照私娼一百十一名，八月份突然增加到二百八十名，九月一日至十二日之中，又查獲八十一名，總數在五百名左右，而全市登記的娼妓總數倒也祇有九百六十五名。</p>
<p>三二二五號警士杜輝亭，奉了施分局長之命，專門執行清除「烟花」的任務。九月十二日夜裏，他穿了便衣，另外再帶了三名便衣弟兄，到芝罘路偷鷄橋又抓到了四名「野鷄，」不想剛預備牽「鷄」回衙的時候，忽然一輛吉普車風馳電掣而來，跳下四位身穿空軍制服的壯士，竟然拔刀相助，阻止他們在偷鷄橋邊捉「鷄。」他們想把杜輝亭拖上吉普卡，杜輝亭的三個弟兄就上前抵抗，一時劍拔弩張，眼見得就要展開大戰，社輝亭吹起了警笛，一時警士密佈，吉普卡連忙作戰略上之撤退，四位壯士之中的兩個，仍舊沒有逃成，這二人一個名叫毛玉田，另一個却姓名不詳，可以說是一位「無名英雄」這件事當然也許不過是一種誤會，但是警士「捉鷄，」又何勞英雄仗義救「美」呢？經過研究之後，原來這四位被捕的「美人」之中，有一個是這四位「英雄」之一的風塵知己—但願這一場小小喜劇之後，「英群美人」終告團圓了倒也很好。既是一個熱心男子，又何忍叫自己所喜歡的女子過「餐風飲露」的生活呢？</p>
<p>昨天，施分局長召集了集中拘禁在老閘分局裏的老少私娼四五十名，懇切地勸誡一番，叫她們以後不要再操這最苦的職業。</p>
<p>其實，普天下的女子，誰會得心甘意願的過這種日子呢！</p>

<h3>輪船業緊急會議　報告改善水路軍運辦法內容議決函催行總開示待運物資</h3>
<p>本市輪船業公會，為商討航榮上當前各種重要問題，特於昨日下午三時，在漢口路外灘交通銀行三樓，召開緊急理監事聯席會議，到錢永銘，林熙生，等全體理監事，由楊管北主席，首由秘書長李雲良，報告會同國營招商局副總經理胡時淵及上海水路軍運辦公處主任劉耀漢，赴京與聯合動務總司令部運輸署署長郗恩綏，商洽改善水路軍運辦法及調整差費情形。據稱：上海航業界，所擬改善水路軍運辦法綱要，大部分已蒙政府採納，此後軍運租用船隻，均參照普通租船辦法，預立合同，凡政府指定擔任特種任務，如專運救濟物資之船隻，航行固定航綫維持交通之定期班船，均兌予租用，軍品及零星部隊均採用交運辦法，軍品照商貨運價八折計費，士兵照普通票價　折計費。關於差租，亦經商定，川江增至基數之十二倍，即以價之三倍，其餘各航綫增至基數之八倍，即原價之二倍。聯勤部為謀租船及交運船隻調度之妥善起見，決定設立水路軍還聯絡小組，由上海水路軍運辦公處，上海輪船業公會，及國營招商局各推代表一人，經常保持聯繫，除國營招商局已推定林奐亭為代表外，公會方面亦經會議推派該會業務組長姜渭泉，代表參加聯絡小組，該組辦公地點設於漢口路九十七號，即可開始工作。次討論各輪船公司協助營運行總船隻，以利救濟物資運輸之具體辦法，當經決定集合國營及民營各公司之力量，為行總代理所有船舶之業務，竭誠效勞。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕輪船業公會於昨日鄭重決議，函催行總儲運　，連將儲存上海待運救濟物資之數量及目的地開示，以便負責配載運出。現長江淺水季節，不久即將開始。各同業願以所有船舶噸位在淺水以前搶運完畢，每月運量至少可達十萬噸之多。又悉：現在上海儲存待運漢口之物資，僅有兩萬噸，而最近數日內開往漢口之輪船，有鴻大，大達，江寗，魯興等多艘，即可一掃而空，關於救濟物資之運道，絕對不成問題云。</p>
<h3>內河航業情况亟待設法整頓　運費不統一班次無定期乘客寥寥各輪設備化</h3>
<p>（本報訊）記者頃晤江浙內河輪船聯營公司汪劍平君，當詢以勝利後內河船舶整理，及最近狀况，承一一答復，據謂戰前同業有三十一家，小輪八十四艘，計二百六十噸，拖船三白五十八艘，約七千八百噸，航行十五綫。戰時同業犧牲極大，老公司均無力經營。</p>
<p>勝利後公會加以整理，目下同業計源通輪船總局·同仁輪船公司·上海源　輪船總局·大利股份兩合公司附屬平滬輪船局·上海慶記輪船總局·閔南協記內河輪船公司·淞滬輪船公司·發記輪船局·大江南輪運局·公茂輪船局·華大企業股份兩合公司·上海興昌輪船總局·立興新記輪船總局·利興盈記輪船局·寗紹申盛輸錯局·正昌行記輪船局·興記昶運輸公司·合記輪運局·協興內河輪船公司等十九家，較戰前减少十分之四，其中僅源！。源錫·發記·利興·公茂等五家為老公司，所有船隻，全部犧牲，故一時尚無力復業。各新公司之船隻，較戰前尤多約十之八，計有一百四十餘隻，但設備大部不全，尤以發動機以汽車引擎改造，及以戤司令為燃料之船隻，更為危臉，對於消防工具大都不備，當局不加注意，公會亦無法整頓·航綫現祗申錫常·申湖（湖州）·申平（平湖）·申虞（常熟）·申沙（沙溪）·申杭（杭州）·申蘇（蘇州）等七綫，較戰前减少八綫，營業狀况尚可，航綫並不規定，僅視貨運之繁盛與否，隨時更改其航綫。例如申湖班貨多，即大部船隻行駛申湖綫，如申蘇貨多，即大家行駛申蘇綫。運費亦無統一價目，視貨運多寡，自由增减，比之普運一般運費，確為便宜，每噸一萬元，每担祇五百元，此在客家祇求迅速運抵目的地，即每件出費一二千元，亦所情願，故對運費，祇有增加，決無减低。至於客票價目，據稱：乘客寥寥，因公路鐵路便利不少，時間可縮短，費用又經濟，如非有笨重之行李，而為公路鐵路不便携帶者，決不至改　小輪。戰前各公司競爭營業，將票價一减再减，貧苦者　圖便宜，不惜時間，乘坐小輸，現在與戰前情况適得其反，故乘客全無，各公司對客位亦不講求，各輪設備，已逐漸退化。記者復詢將來如何可納入正軌，汪君搖首曰，希望甚微，現在唯一之希望，當局須用嚴正法治之手腕，依法整頓，前途尚可補救，至比告辭而別。</p>
<h3>滬甬綫輪班次確定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕長江·南北洋各綫船　，復航以來，因受軍公運輸所阻，迄無正確班期，商運旅客均感不便，據熟悉航業者言，對於船期規定，各公司均所樂為惟因應差關係，故確定班期，短期內恐難實現，祇有滬甬綫（即上海至寗波）輪船，取期已可確定，招商局江亞輸規定星期一三五自滬駛甬，平安局大華輪，星期二四六由滬開寗波。泰昌祥徉江蘇　，定星期三五日自滬駛甬，並灣鎮海。穿山公司穿山輪，現已修理工竣，定明日復航寗波班，定星期二四日，自滬開寗波。江亞輪昨日駛甬，明日返滬後暫停修理鍋爐，約下星期五修竣復航。目下行駛滬甬綫班輪，計有四艘，照上述班次，每日有船駛甬，除星期一天祇有一輪外，平日每天均有兩輪同開寗波，滬甬問旅客稱便不少。</p>

<p>她說：她的丈夫「張先生」是一個「學者」，是寃枉的。「說我一個女人可指揮一件大舞弊案，這不是笑話？」</p>
<p>儘管她說得起勁，手和嘴不停的在發抖。儘由着她本人替她丈夫叨叨絮護，然而起訴書說她有罪，而陳局長的「舞弊」，她却提不出一件實據。</p>
<p>這位卅一　的「處長太太」是大夏六學法科畢業生，昨天穿了一件湖綠色底白圈花的短袖旗袍。赤脚穿着雙奶黃色香檳皮的軟底鞋。而髪蓬鬆，用藍絨繩紮了兩只小辮。而色　　，的確像有烟容。嘴裏的一只金牙已黯然無光，手指上所塗的寇丹亦已褪色。問起獄中的生活，她苦笑搖頭，說了兩個字：「痛苦！」</p>

<h3>籃球賽　空軍表演大爲進步　戰汕隊未分勝負　上半時各二十結果五十一平手</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南京空軍籃球隊昨晚作訪滬第三戰，與汕隊對壘，八時在市體育館舉行，空軍隊進步迅速，昨劇戰結果，卒未分勝負，上半時各二十分，總結果爲各五十一平手，經雙方商討之下，握手言和。</p>
<p>主將缺席</p>
<p>汕隊昨戰，仍能發揮其固有之作風，以快捷演出，但因缺一馬傑希，指揮無人，以致未能快中取穩，减色不少，未獲勝利者在此。新人劉景行之射籃，輕鬆可取，陳淸江林維聰射藍均不順手，亦屬反常。</p>
<p>客車得路</p>
<p>空軍在此戰中，已能發揮釘人成功一點，而利用阻碍法，得能深入籃底，尤爲可貴。守攻但見上路，秦循則劉振元身手靈活，俱有滿意之表演。</p>
<p>難解難分</p>
<p>兩隊准時上塲，汕隊以何立德，陳淸江，劉景行，蔡演雄，紀南康，五虎上陣，客軍則有秦循則，劉振元，葛克之鋒，王賀林李先樾之後衛，開始後，汕隊一鼓作氣，以五對一佔先，客軍暫停，追成各五，形勢始終緊凑，於是分數不相上下者久之，上半時各二十分。下半時汕隊又佔上風，客軍奮力追上，分數終是一二球之差，三三比二九時，汕隊蔡演雄受傷離塲，不無影響，此後雙方犯規累累，直至終塲，各五十一分，雙方同意，不再延長。</p>

<h3>配紗照額全配　紱建掛牌未動　紗號仍嘆向隅　實銷活動市價止跌回漲　拋售棧單廠家積極整飭</h3>
<p>（本報訊）昨紗市已轉機，湘漢帮納胃甚健，京皖內地來客採辦亦殷，故價乃止跌回漲，廿支約升一二萬，市上特金雞大發四百廿磅，重者成交二百五十五萬與特雙馬價不相上下，而聯合配銷委員會所核售之四百磅標準紗，如金雞大發現貨，雖叫價一百卅六七萬，亦乏人受買、可見輕磅貨、不受歡迎之一般，四十一支昨有布廠採買，偎復迫近二百卅萬大關，較前日漲起五萬上下，十時紡建循例掛牌，價仍維持外匯調整前之盤子，然只配廠家，紗號業絲毫不得染指，十一時紡建復有十天期貨開貨，一切均照聯合配銷辦法、該公司昨日所開，爲藍鳳等牌二十三種，四十二支寳光一百八十九萬，二十支藍鳳一百六十萬，大半配售於染織工廠，三十二支五彩星等，則配代於其他棉製工業，價較上期小三萬，紗號業已三星期一無配給，頗爲焦急，該業公會一面極力整飭市場，一面呼籲配給，但昨日仍米配給，紗業中人殊引爲憾，深盼紡建以後配紗，有以改善，至實用工廠方面，對於少數廠商，拋售棧單情事，亦在密切注意，積極整飭。</p>
<p>紗廠聯合配銷委員會於昨日下午三時舉行例曾。即席議決：開售二十支棉紗標準數額五·六四五件（此中紡建佔二二六三件），照申請額全配。售價以四百磅二十支雙馬爲標準，每件仍爲一百三十萬元。下次開售日期，決定爲十六日。</p>
<p>布市平平，龍頭細布，因紡建已四五次不開，價仍喊六萬七千元，嗶嘰有三次不開，價喊六萬三千五百元，無甚榮辱，藍V字一度曾喊加七千收進，終則下降至六千元，無牌細布，大都照紡她原價脫手，該項細布，校常州貨之鷹駝，上海之天馬，質地少堅，染廠極適胃口，一般字號，則需要不少，故申請者亦寥寥無幾。</p>
<h3>金價回小　美鈔微升</h3>
<p>烚赤昨平庸逾恒，晨開二一五萬五，央行略有供給，即吿下游，十時後央行配給七二條，價二一四萬二五，十時後更爲平和，午刻始再挫落至二一四萬以下，十交易有限，市况冷落，午後即交見低至二一三萬三，便交復回升至二一四萬五左右，結果較前收回小二萬光景，飾金微降爲念二萬七，紋銀平而銀元微升，暗拆銀根平衡，息價在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣亦形平庸，美鈔晨開三三八〇元有售，交易亦少，過程少變，午刻始見疲落至三三五〇元，午後先降至三三四〇元，最後受套買影響，微升至三三八〇元，結果較前收微升五元，對黃金之比價軋攏少許爲六三五三對十兩，港票被港申報縮影響，上升十元，港匯亦然，自六九五元至七〇五元，印匯八四〇元至八五〇元，英匯一一四〇〇元有賣，美匯在牌價徘徊。</p>
<h3>華股由穩轉疲</h3>
<p>華股除冷門小股間有奇軍突起外，餘均感力乏稍退，各股由穩轉疲，熱股中途微有回好，近午仍稍怯軟，交易淸淡，大戶觀望，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福新光勤興續稍低降，較冷各股中型徵挫，小型中除中法新亞微有進展外，餘者亦稍低落，元老殷欲進無力。</p>
<p>外股昨止跌微升，各股均有零星之買戶，爲狀見穩，交易尙不見暢，結果較前收計亞洲會德豐平平，餘者均略回好。</p>
<h3>公債交易不暢</h3>
<p>公債市况繼續徘徊，人心取捨不一，交易不暢，統內晨開二三〇〇元，高價升至二四五〇元，不久又降落至二二一〇元，最後在二二五〇元左右盤旋，結果較前收徵升二十元，甲乙亦好五十元，統丁平平，統戊軋跌七十元。</p>
<h3>建紅買氣旺盛</h3>
<p>紅綠茶花色，本街店莊及蘇錫一帶，去化依然，絡繹不絕，出口行胃納亦愈見展開，因本月二十日之船期，聞已改爲二十三日，各行對於不足之數額，紛紛彌補，尤以福建紅茶，買氣最盛，每担比前軋升二千元有奇。</p>
<h3>糖價大跌小回</h3>
<p>昨糖市以連日步跌，已與公司配價連擊，遂呈大跌小回之象，公會劃　上午廿號中砂白初爲十四萬三千元，旋由三千五百元而四千元五千元六千元，下午更升至七千元，棧單十四萬二千元，生砂十一萬二千，四千元，六千元，比前日升二三四千元，四半車白二十萬元，三半車白十八萬元，提靑叫十二萬五千元至十二萬元，棉赤十三萬三千元，略有成交。</p>

<h3>桐油運美</h3>
<p>［本報訊］順亨洋行經理之芬克利夫號，今晨出口駛美，由滬運去桐油二百七十四箱，茶葉二百十九箱，毛類一百九十一箱，猪鬃一百八十餘件。</p>
<h3>防雨布下游</h3>
<p>毛織品呢羢市面，售價始終穩固，交易尙見不寂，惟防雨布各牌則皆下游，頭號每碼祗喊沽五千元，二號四千七百元，三號四千元，買方需要數量减少，蓋實銷期巳漸過，又受玻璃雨衣廉價影嚮，而正式開水米各種雨衣布已可以定到，有此三因，乃造成目前市貨充斥之現象。</p>
<h3>配給不敷廠需　人造絲昨又大跳　義絲日內即可卸貨</h3>
<p>連朝疲頽之人造絲，昨又反動回高，一二〇天橋有光，上午首光做六十二四萬元，不旋　間，漲至六十八萬元收盤，下午更好，成交七十二萬元，賣出喊七十五萬元，比上日下午大起十五萬元，雜牌各號貨亦被帶起十三四萬元，實因中紡對於絲號家配貨，表示決意停止，而絲織廠所配給之貨，不合銷胃，且爲數甚微，不免仍須向黑市買進，以致造成黑市低而復高之局面，絲號家向一意大利定進之人造絲，早已抵埠，聞將於今日報關繳稅，每箱稅款需七十萬元左右，二三日內即可卸貨，屆時市價或能稍平，不過一二〇號有光絲存底日枯，定貨只二百餘箱，間有無光在內，故短時間內恐難望抑低，但綢貨市怕，與原料比較，相差甚鉅，廠商處此環境中，誠有啼笑皆非之感。</p>
<h3>紡建請求停止</h3>
<p>敵產處理局委託中國紡織建設公司拋售敵產人造絲，已達三千餘箱，現所存者僅爲零星數目，至點收經售手續頗感麻煩，且此項工作所費人工極鉅，該公司非僅毫無利潤，每月尙須賠貼開支，昨據該公司業務處副長蔣迪先云，該項經售人造絲工作，已向敵產處理局請求停止，希望改變經售辦法。</p>
<h3>日貨即將到滬</h3>
<p>本市各絲織廠月需人造絲二千箱，紡建雖有配售，爲數不多，故近一週來，人造絲價格飛漲，中信局將由日本運人造絲四萬箱來滬，各絲織廠咸望届時能增加配售量云。</p>
<h3>證交正式開拍日期本日理監事會決定　保證金變通辦法已核準</h3>

<p>證金代用品，曾呈請經財兩部採取變通辦法，暫以行莊書面保證替代。昨奉指令准予變通，由中央銀行指定滬市會員銀行若干家，由經紀人目行接洽，以書面保證，抵充代用，向中央銀行呈繳。並限令各該經紀人，於證交開業之日起一個月內，將此項保證調換代用品。現該所已與中央銀行接洽，並函各經紀人照辦，以便遵照理事會所決定日期開拍。又聞交易所代收之交易稅辦法，尙在呈部核示中，該所當局希望能於定期開拍前，接奉指令，或不致影響開拍日期云。</p>

<h3>戰前存款千倍償付案　四行儲蓄會之上訴書</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕戰前銀行存款，上海法院判決應依照）千倍償付事，引起全國金融界極大之衝動，四行儲蓄會上海分會，對上海地方法院判決該會對存戶陳季琳於民國廿九年之存款二千元，應照一千倍償付案，表示不服。已向高等法院，詳述理由。提起公訴書，已於昨日下午向地院投遞請轉呈高院，特照錄其原文如下：</p>
<p>爲補具理由事。竊上訴人不服上海地方法院卅五年度訴字第一六一〇號民事判決一案，業經於法定期間內，聲明上訴在案。綜閱原審理由，非拘尼於法例文字之形式。即以想像之推論，爲判決之基磋，實難折服，茲謹補貝理由如次。</p>
<p>按復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條之適用，應具四種要件，缺一不可。（一）限於法律行爲成立後，效果消滅之前，（二）不可歸責於當事人之事由（三）非當事所能預料者，（四）其效果顯失公平者，査情事變更，爲顯著之普遍現像，但幣値跌落乃戰事必然之結果。非可歸責於上訴人之事由。况被上訴人存款係在民國廿九年戰事已亘三四年之後，國府業已遷渝，宣布長期抗戰政策。物價步高，乃婦孺盡知之事實。則幣値日跌之必然趨勢，被上訴人庸能歸爲非當時所能預料者，旣無可責於上訴人之事由，在被上訴人又有富時所能預料之後果，則適用本條之先決條件已不存在。退一步言，復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例曁司法院院字第三〇一八號解釋，立法之本意，在求給付之公平，並非單純以追逐物價指數爲能事，故載明「……法院應公平裁量爲增减給付……」換言之，權義損益，本屬對立關係，應兼顧雙方經濟狀態，實際情形爲增加或减少給付之公平裁量，就本案言，上訴人自民國廿九年至光復後，歷受幣制影響，一再變更總額，由二比一而二百比一，故受存被上訴人之二千元，一度迫於環境，兌成僞幣千元。依此再遵法令折爲法幣，祇剩五元。在敵偽盤据時期，强行僞幣，使用法幣，固屬違禁，一旦發現，且有不可測之危險。而今不但課上訴人，以恢復原存額之責，抑且令爲增加千倍以爲給付。即被上訴人折存五元而需二百萬元之受償，無異加重上訴人四十萬借之責任。須知上開條例之適用，非債權人所獨享，則因不可歸責於上訴人之事由，致情勢變更，何以獨令上訴人担負當時所得預料之效果。且以四十萬倍計算，普遍適用於全體存戶，豈上訴人之資力所能負担。單以物價指數爲標準，偏袒一方之利益，殊失立法公平之本意。此不服者一。」</p>
<p>復投原審理由認定上訴人一於收受儲蓄存款後，果將一部份存款作爲流動資金，其餘存款，或購公債及其他債券，作爲擔保或投資於房地產，……」査上訴人簡稱：「四行儲蓄會」以複利方法收受存款，依儲畜銀行法第一條第二項之規定，應「視同儲蓄銀行」依同法第四條之規定，上訴人除經營收付存款代理買賣外，不得兼營其他業務，原審所謂投資於房地產，不知究何所據。旣認定上訴人所買公債曁提存中央之擔保「受財政部票面還本辦法之影響，而蒙受相當損失」，乃推論上訴人「在其他方面之投資，莫不大增其貨幣之數額」，不顧實際祗求想像上之公平，蓋所稱投資已無根據，遽謂投資只有利而無損，尤屬味於商情。矧上訴人在財政部嚴密監督之下，業務受其監視，金融受其檢査，豈容從事法定業務外之投資，至於資金之運用，亦以放款爲對象，回憶去秋勝利實現之時，複員接收之初，幣制之統一，折兌之比率，已囂塵上，故債務人紛紛以僞儲券爭先淸憤。上訴人所收回者爲們幣，以二百作一，是貨幣數額已遭受兩百倍之損失，而非原判決所稱一貸幣數額之增加」此不服者二·</p>
<p>綜上理由，原審判決於法於理，俱有未當，爲此狀請鈞院鑒核判決，俯准廢棄原判決，駁回被上訴人在第一審增加給付之請求，並令負擔兩審訴訟費用，實感公便。</p>

<h3>「天使的微語」</h3>
<p>— 平齊</p>
<p>詩人司各脫對音樂的印象是：「那麼甜蜜，那麼溫文，那麼飄渺，像是天使的微語。」音樂把我們引進一個新的境界。這境界，如果用中國的詩來描述，我想　定庵的「是仙是幻是溫柔也許說着了一些。</p>
<p>人間何世！在整天費心盡機的左擋右拒之後，讓我們來一點音樂罷。</p>
<p>不是要逃避。祇是，弓弦不能永遠拉緊，我們應當偶然也鬆弛一下。音樂，牠暫時把我們帶近了遙遠的家園，牠重溫了我們童年的夢。</p>
<p>我們惑謝這世界上還有都斯卡尼尼這樣的人，他的魔杖使我們走近了悲多汶心裏的田園中的靜靜的溪流，偶然飛過的明朗的雲雀；這魔杖也把我們引進了修裴爾德的無何奈何的惆悵；却伊考夫斯基的海一般深的絕望。</p>
<p>今天，我們虔誠地把都斯卡尼尼和斯篤考斯基介紹于讀者之前。他們並不祇屬于任何一個國家，他們是全人類的光榮！</p>

<h3>隱逸</h3>
<p>— 過之槩</p>
<p>宋真宗封禪後找到一個隱士周朴，強迫召了去，周朴矢口不承認會作詩，真宗問他被徵的時候是否有人作詩送行。他說，衹有老　做了一首。詩云，「更休落魄耽杯酒，再莫倡狂愛作詩。如今捉將官裏去，這回斷送老頭皮！」真宗聽了大笑，也衹好放他回去了。</p>
<p>以隱逸被徴，自來認為最榮耀的事，他卻認為是被捉到官裏，認為要斷送頭皮。這真是對政治最大的控訴，隱逸思想，大概起於戰國，濫　夷齊。這是對政治的消極抗爭或不承認主義，「天下不得而臣，諸侯不得而友」，實在是自居於政治範圍之外。隱逸的理論，在莊子手裏已經大備。</p>
<p>這一思想，在我國政治上有極大的作用，這使政治衹有相對的作用，人主衹有相對的權威。無論怎麼樣，總不能為所欲為。暴力當然有受限制，但暴力總不能持久。在不承認主義之下，儘早是要消滅的。</p>
<p>我國民族，在幾千年專制之下，到底藉隱逸思想得到一個精神上的安全區。</p>
<p>自從人民為國家的主人之後，隱逸思想便不能存在，更無論隱逸的事實，但暴力卻仍舊可以存在。對付暴力，據陶淵明說，「賢者避其世」，是要賢者纔知道逃避的。老百姓卻無從逃避，衹好拼出命來，走最後的一條路。</p>
<h3>“石濤畫語錄”窺探　（上）</h3>
<p>— 鄭為</p>
<p>想對歷史上一個偉大的藝術家，作一番窺探的功夫，僅僅靠些他所遺留的作品來推測，我相信他的結論不會超過「偉者偉也」類同的估價，這是說徒然的。藝術品在作家生命的本身，可以說是精華，如其在精神意態這發展上說來，不過等於排泄，甚至是渣滓。雖然能夠給其他的人以　當的滋，但不能據此作為研究他創作的原始資料。每每事物真理的發掘，常在與其相應的事物上得到線索，並且與他物相關連的範圍愈廣密，他本身的價值，亦往往愈大。</p>
<p>對於每一樣深究廣泛的石濤，研究者所取的態度就該這樣，作者不敢忽略與石濤種種有關的問題，並藉此種種關係作為窺探石濤整個心靈的嵬奇狀采，往常聽見人說：石濤是從臨摹脫胎的，也有人說：石是完全獨開造境的天才，這些膚淺的見解，不管是否出於那些想替自己作現身說法，總之，他們連宇宙最單純的結構，都不會明白，與本文相差甚遠，不擬有所批判。</p>
<p>石濤畫語錄，不僅在石濤是精心的著作，可以說：在歷代純理論的畫論中，也是一部無與倫比的偉構，他不但對自己的作品，做了一番最好的解釋，同時替這數千年東方藝術品奠下了最高的審美標準。</p>
<p>一個極重視「尊受」的藝術家，不會抹殺他前面許多先進所留存的好處，但那種廣泛融會的程度，很難使我們窺探到當時他所攝受的資源，同時對石濤亦極不必作其得之某家失之某家的態度。在尊受章：</p>
<p>「貴乎尊得其受，而不尊以自棄也」。</p>
<p>「泥古不化，是識拘之也，識拘於似則不廣，故君子惟借古以谷氨酸今也。」（老子：執古之道，以御今之有，能知古始，是謂道紀）。變化章：</p>
<p>「至人無法，非無法也，無法而法，乃為至法，凡事有經必有權，有法必有化，一知其經即變，一知其法即化。」</p>
<p>都是在替攝受作緊的註腳，所以談到石濤攝受的問題，於其稱他忠實於先進的遺產，不如稱其忠於自然界的感受來得妥帖。自然；乃藝術家脈胳的所在，一如商賈之重視其財產，所不同的，一個守住他窄小的所有（役於物），而沒有對於自然，無所謂佔有與隱匿，莊子藏天下於天下，足以表明這種坦然的態度，原因不在藝術家對自然的關心，不若商賈的財產，而是他本身自覺他屬於自然，自然屬於他，他永遠不能脫離自然，自然也永遠不能離開他。山川章：</p>
<p>「山川使予代山川言也，山川脫胎於予也，予脫胎於山川也」。</p>
<p>在這樣融會攝受間，可以反省到一個問題——「我」，也就是藝術上所謂個性的存在，能受任的「我」在意義上有很大的外延，因為宇宙間誰不在受任？誰不被受任？資任章：</p>
<p>「以　運觀之，則受蒙養之任。以　操觀之，則受生活之任。以山川觀之，則受胎骨之任。以鄰波觀之，則受畫變之任。以滄海觀之，則受天地之任。以坳堂觀之，則受須臾之任。以無為觀之，則受有為之任。以一畫觀之，則受萬　之任。以虛腕觀之，則愛穎脫之任。」</p>
<p>萬千種物體都有獨特的自我表現，萬千種獨特的自我表現，而匯合成不可分割渾然一體的大我（自然），這是什麼緣故呢？資任章有幾段話：</p>
<p>「先資任之所任。」</p>
<p>「非此案行其任，則又何能周天下之山川，通天下之血脈乎？」</p>
<p>「古今不亂，筆墨常存，因其浹洽斯任而已。」</p>
<p>「任」，就是我與萬物融成一體的根本，也是「我」之所以為「我」，衹有互相資任，才能實現各個個體的「我」，衹有充實萬千個體的我，才能充沛所謂道（生生不息的自然）易曰「萬物資始」，由此可以說：配義與道的「任」，就是天任。</p>
<p>如何行使這種「天任」，畫語錄告訴我們「蒙養與生活」，石濤非常重視牠，在畫語錄也是最多提到的，石濤所以在藝術史上，如此輝煌，其作品能如是幽妙超脫，就在他懂得「任」，成為石濤的宇宙觀。「蒙養與生活」潤化了石濤的智慧。資任章：</p>
<p>「非山之任水，不足以見乎周流，非水之任山，不足見乎環抱，山水之任不著，則周流環抱無由，周流環抱不著。則蒙養生活無方，蒙養生活有操，則周流環環抱有由，周流環抱有由，則山水之任息矣」</p>
<p>「然則斯任者，誠蒙養生活之理，以一治萬，以萬治一」。又在筆墨章說：</p>
<p>「山川萬物之具體，有反有正，有偏有斜，有聚有散，有近有遠，有內有外，有虛有實，有斷有連，有層次，有剝落，有細緻，有　　，此生活之大端也，故山水萬物之　靈於人，因為操此蒙養生活之　，茍非其然，焉能使筆墨之下，有胎有骨，有關有合，有體有用，有形有體，有拱有立，有蹲跳，有潛伏，有衝霄，有　男，有磅礴，有巍峨，有　　，有奇峭，有險峻，一一畫其靈而足其神」。</p>
<p>因為人（個體）操此蒙養生活的權能，於是在他的眼底，自然不再是些無生命的土石木塊，而充沛蓋形與態，胎與骨，神與靈的物事。</p>
<p>到這裏，我們不妨閉起眼睛想一想，從這種有胎有骨，有神有靈的境界裏，走出來的石濤，當他提筆吮墨的時候，試問：古人的法，會在石濤重視到如何地步？他會不會想到宗某家不宗某家呢？會不會想到有些什麼「　法」「三疊」的規矩呢？關於這點，變化章有明白的指示的：</p>
<p>「夫盡天下變通之大法也，山川形勢之精英也。古今造物之陶冶也。陰陽氣度之流行也。借筆墨以寫天地萬物而陶泳於我也，今人不明乎此，動則曰：某家幾點可以立腳，非似某家山水不能傳久，某家清濯，可以立品，非似某家工巧，衹足娛人，是我為某家役，非某家為我用也。縱逼似某家，亦食某家殘羹耳，於我何有哉！或有謂余曰：某家博我也，某家約我也，我將於何門戶，於何階級，於何比擬，於何效騐，於何點染，於何　　，於何形勢，能使我即古，而古即我，如是者，知有古而不知有我者也，我之為我，自有我在，古之　眉，不能生在我之鬚眉，縱有時觸著某家，是某家就我也，非我故為某家也，天然授之也，我於古何師而不化之有。」</p>
<p>一切的規矩，不過是在為「障」而有的。所以如果是「天然授之也」，也就無障可言，沒有障，也就沒有什麼規矩可言。石濤所謂「畫從心而障自遠」。從心，就是應順不踰矩的意思（孔子有從心所欲而不踰矩）但是這些又豈為膚淺低能的拔匠所能理會？因此石濤憮然曰：</p>
<p>「世知有規矩，而不知夫乾旋坤轉之義也」。</p>
<p>天地的運行，在應順自然，何會有什麼規矩，因為沒有障，所以一切的運動都成為中規矩的。這就是「不化而應化，無為而有為」的天人渾合的境界。再如在他談到筆墨：</p>
<p>「墨之濃筆也以靈，筆之運墨也以神，墨非蒙養不靈，筆非生活不神」。引法章：</p>
<p>「夫畫者，形天地萬物者也，舍筆墨其何以形之哉。墨受於天，濃淡枯潤隨之，筆操於人，勾　烘染隨之」。變化章：</p>
<p>「借筆墨以寫天地萬物而陶泳於我也」。　　章：</p>
<p>「在墨海之定精神，筆鋒下決出生活，尺幅上換去毛骨，混沌裏放出光明。縱使筆不筆，墨不墨，自有我在。」（若其筆是筆，墨是墨，我何居何立？正在筆不筆，墨不墨間，我得大自然往來耳——為案）</p>

<p>「你念過書嗎？」W君又問。</p>
<p>「……」小老虎好像囫圇的吞下了一個石蛋，正在無法咀嚼的時候。</p>
<p>「念過些，」耀羣笑著答應，「我問過他，在他們寨子裏待過大半年，所以也知道些：他大概念過一本「三字經」，一本「百家姓」，一本「四言雜字」，還有一本「幼學瓊林」，兩本「四書」，大概就是上下論。後來我給他教過一本初小常識，一點史地。省城自從九一八淪陷後，教科書都改了，一時買不到合式的課本……這一點，衹要虎弟弟常在我一起，我想我應當負點責任……。」</p>
<p>「那好極了。」我同W君同時迸出了這句話。W君又說，「眼面前我想兩位大概還不至於分開工作……我很想，因為通州的事很急，……我想請耀羣小姐同……」W君還沒知道小老虎的名字。</p>
<p>「他學名是虎臣兩個字」，耀羣插口，「後來把君臣這個臣字，改作城市的城。」</p>
<p>「是的，」W君點點頭，「我想請你二位明天到我們的　　處去，把一點手續辦一辦，然後，或者在我們那裏休息一天，後天就到通州去……」</p>
<p>「那敢情好。」耀羣也站了起來，感覺有點興奮似的，明亮的一雙眼睛熠發出一股光芒來，「既然通州那邊的事很急，要是你不怕煩，……要是可以的話，……能不能今天晚上，就這個時候，我同虎弟弟就去報到，帶辦手續，明天一早，就可以上道哪。」微帶曛色的兩頰上，隨著話聲，泛起了一片紅霞。</p>
<p>自從我和W君見面以來，我看他面容上一直流露著感情，並不像一般特務工作者所謂「撲克」面孔之流——不動聲色——同時他卻有一種描寫不出的沉著的姿態。這時他聽了耀羣的要求，當然他也明瞭耀羣並非躁急，也非淺薄之流，爭於要走馬上任，只是要把握住「時間」的因素，所以沉吟了一下，立即點點頭：</p>
<p>「也好，衹是你們兩位太辛苦一點，……另外，你們二位對於通州可有些熟習嗎？」</p>
<p>「咱們那邊也有人。」小老虎　不住了；可是有些辭不達意，或是答不對題。</p>
<p>「去過幾次，」耀羣接過話來。「寨子裏常到那兒去活動，尤其是這些虎弟弟，人雖小，關內關外決丟不了他這個小人兒……記憶力特別科學家，無論是人，是地方，是東西，只要見過一次，他決忘不了；並且，哪怕是黑夜，伸手不見掌，他可以認得出方向。」耀羣把小老虎的特長，又說明了一樣。</p>
<p>「好！」W君站了起來，瞧了瞧表，「還要收拾一下吧……」說著，把屋子裏面四下掃射了一眼。</p>
<p>我也跟著站了起來；「我們可以上車子裏去等一下」？想著耀羣他們也許要歸著衣服用品哪什麼的。</p>
<p>「沒什麼拾掇的你哪」，耀羣笑著，「哪一時我們都是預備著的，說走就走。　上是熟人，招呼一聲就得！」</p>
<p>她話還沒說完，小老虎早打開衣櫥，拿出一只小手提皮匝，一個布包，拎在手上。他的動作，乾淨利落，其快無比；兩只大圓眼珠流動的光芒裏，藏著一種說不盡的笑意。（第三章完）</p>

<h3>馬禁開不得　—人民的意見—</h3>
<p>— 翁正平</p>
<p>假如開放馬禁，這原與我們低級的小職員，風馬牛不相關的，根本我們何來「閑情逸致」雲賽馬？至於那班因了賽馬而傾家蕩產的，到底是「有閑階級」的自食其果者，用不著我們雲同情，同時還可以使一部份賽馬會裏的失業職員一下子可以得到「復員」的機會，一方面市府稅收可以增到三億至五億，一舉而數得，何樂而不為？</p>
<p>可是話得說回來，賽馬既有如此的幾項好理由，為什麼在當初勝利的旗幟飄到上海來的時候，將它禁了？難道說彼一時此一時嗎？至於說這是正當的娛樂，那末首都為什麼要禁舞？舞，終究還沒有賭博性的，現在提倡開放馬禁的諸公，不曉得有沒有顧慮到這一點，可以自圓其說的地方？</p>
<p>假如說政府有領導民眾的責任和話，那末騫馬恢復了，到底對人有點什麼益處？難道這一塊地皮，除了可以賽馬外，可說一無用處嗎？我真有點不懂！總裁說：「國家的治亂，民族的興亡，常以社會風氣為轉移，我們中國的社會風氣受不平等條約的影響，以租界為根源，表現為「類風惡習」，現在不平等條約已經撤廢，租界不復存在，則社會風氣轉移的責任，又將在誰的手裏？」這裏有很明白的指示我們，就是人民自已的責任，政府有領導人民的責任，那末假使開放馬禁了，社會風氣是不是會轉移？假使能不轉移的話，認為是天經地義的話，我們盡可以要求政府恢復按摩浴室和那歌女社響導社，因為那裏也有失業的一群，也有大量的稅收哩！</p>
<p>好在市參議會開幕了，身為市民代表者，大可發表宏論，要不要開放馬禁，我們小百姓當時也曾經投過你一票啊！</p>
<p>重複一句：馬禁開不得，這是人民的要求！</p>
<h3>關於跑馬廳</h3>
<p>— 金聲</p>
<p>關於跑馬廳，我有下列的意見：（一）租界已早隨勝利收回，跑馬廳的主權，應　國人主管，所有少不了的幾位西人，衹得參以顧問。（二）考世界各國，文明都市，未有將跑馬場設於鬧市之中區，一旦比賽塵土飛揚，於市民健康上，大有妨礙。況輸贏頗巨，亦易養成不道德之風。（三）如實行寓禁於徵，開放馬禁，可於滬市郊外另尋場所，「前江灣東首亦有跑馬場」，曾有一位提倡過復興「新上海」的計劃，我想那邊也有不少的空地，加以利用，好得「布爾喬亞」之流，有的是四只腳的「汽車」再遠點也沒關係，所謂離開一丈眼目清涼。</p>
<h3>孩子話母親</h3>
<p>— 吳孝田</p>
<p>「母親燒沸了咖啡，給每個人沖著一杯。她放糖給爸爸的那一杯，每次比我多。我吵著要同爸爸的放得一樣，她對我說：多吃糖要牙齒痛。」</p>
<p>「怎麼爸爸那杯放的糖多就不痛嗎？」我想著要說，但是看見媽媽杯子裏的糖放得比我還少，我就不響了。」這是一個最聰明的六歲孩子說的。</p>
<p>都市病態</p>
<h3>漫談自殺</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>自殺在上海，是個老毛病，但這毛病一直沒有好。</p>
<p>這顯示著社會的不安定。</p>
<p>這些自殺者所以要戕害自已的原因，為了生計困難的佔絕大多數，其次是家庭不和以及男女殉情，神經錯亂等。</p>
<p>除了這些原因以外，從前還有許多人為了憂憤國事而自殺的。十餘年前監察院監委社義的目沉玄武湖，五卅慘案後無數愛國志士的自殺，以冀喚醒國人，以及民國廿五年有一個十四歲的小學生周自信的吞硝酸水自殺，都是屬於這一類。</p>
<p>在自殺事件中，有不少值得一般心理學家研討的問題。舉一個例：十年前北平旗人關振鐸，平日好讀紅樓夢，鏡花緣之類的小說，一夕侍奉其伯祖母的疾病夜　不寐，忽發奇想，自縊而死。死後各方猜測原因，終得不得適當的解釋。</p>
<p>但不論其原因為何，自殺者總不值得同情。法律上，自殺者是有罪的，不過無法執行而已。</p>
<p>據統計：歐洲各國的自殺率，以瑞士為最高。原因是多數病人在瑞士療養，往往在發覺自已不能恢復健康時，便索性自殺了。在亞洲，顯然要算日本為「最愛自殺的民族」了，他們的「切腹」和「跳火山口」，是祖傳獨特的自殺方法。</p>
<p>自殺的民族</p>
<p>在東京有過一個「自殺會」，會中規定，凡會員中已先自殺者，應即告其他會員，挨著第二個的會員便得在六個月之內自殺。非等到所有會員都已自殺之前，不得洩秘密。但後來當地警察署在一個自殺的會員身畔，查出了該會的一份章程，方始偵悉，把它查禁了。</p>
<p>日本的熱海，是一個著名的自殺市，該處濱海，風景優美，一晝夜至少有二十人投海自殺，原因大都係情死。</p>
<p>英國奇奧格爾克博士，曾統計過二十年間歐洲男女所用的自殺方法。結論是：男子以縊死者最多。其次為槍殺和置身鐵道上的自殺：女子以投河為最多，次為服毒及　下死者。但奇氏的統計離現在已有多年，現在最通用的自殺手段，服毒佔百分之七十以上。吞來沙爾，臭蟲藥粉，雅片，安眠藥片，DDT「爬蟲動」……名目繁多，不勝細載。這也可作為城市科學發達的一證（？）吧！　　自殺的研究</p>
<p>人們最容易自殺的年齡，是二十歲到三十歲之間，又根據統計，五月為自殺最多的季節，自殺的發生時間最多在午後十時左右，通常自殺者以男性較女性為多。</p>
<p>自殺與氣象也有很關系根據心裏衛生學家的研究結果，在濕度六十五度到八十度，氣壓七五四緾到七六七緾，溫度在攝氏二十度至二十三度之間，最容易造成自殺的悲劇。</p>
<p>最後，特別要提出一點：自殺者的痛苦，都由於社會的缺陷而起，要解脫此種痛苦，惟有挺身百出，從事改造社會的工作。從自殺中求解脫，是最懦弱也是最愚蠢的下策！</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>戎馬書生李默庵</h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>負責確保江蘇全境和浙皖一部份地區治安的，新任第一綏靖區司令官司李默庵中將，是一位標准的「戎馬書生。」</p>
<p>豐富經驗</p>
<p>他是湖南長沙人，黃浦軍官學校第一期，陸軍大學將官班第二期畢業生，現年四十二歲，但是治軍作戰，已經有二十年以上的經驗，在「西南幹部訓練班教育長」任內，造就中下級幹部，數達八千餘人又曾一度執教鞭，他著有：「國防講話，「治軍作戰一貫論」，「軍隊教育與青年訓練」「軍隊教育問題」和「軍官團要義等六種，都是頗有價值的軍事著述。</p>
<p>將軍的經歷，十四年三月還只是少尉排長，因戰功累升連營團長，至二十八年十二月，即榮任了湘鄂邊區挺進軍中將總指揮。三十一年九月升任第三十二集團軍總司令，今年七月就任第一綏靖區中將司令官。</p>
<p>英皇贈勳章</p>
<p>他曾先後獲到國民政府頒授的三等實鼎勳章，三等雲亦可麾勳章，忠勤勳章，陸海空軍甲種一等獎章，幹城一等獎章，並在民國三十四年榮獲英皇喬治六世所贈C.B.E.最優勳章。這許多特殊榮寵，不啻是他的忠貞功績的證明。</p>
<p>李氏治軍很嚴，最重紀律，私生活亦注意規律，待人接物，據說也並不以身居顯要而自傲。他最喜歡欣賞音樂和書畫，公餘更愛研究及閱讀書報雜誌，對於資料的整理很有心得。他嗜好的運動是騎馬和拍網球。</p>
<p>他的夫人顧秀靈女士可以說是賢內助，已經有三子五女，均在中小學攻讀。家庭之間經常維持著應有的和諧。</p>
<p>和靄的風度</p>
<p>從一件趣事中可以測見李氏的為人，當旅長任內，他曾偕友人觀劇，由勤務兵購票，友人和兵先行入場，李氏稍為落後，便被收票擱阻，他說明已由前行士兵買票，因為那天李氏衣的是長衫便服，且以身材矮小，類似小商人模樣，戲院內派駐監場的衛兵，以為李氏係冒名欲看白戲，遂用步槍向李氏驅逐，情狀甚為不堪。後來該勤務兵出來尋覓主人，見到這般情形，便上前責打那一個魯莽的守衛，李氏雖身受侮辱，並未動恐，且含笑撫慰那惶恐失措的衛兵，怒是職責所在，並無過失，一面喝止自已的勤務兵，不要打人，我們覺得這種情形是軍人最需要的，否則，軍與民，將官與下級就難融洽了。</p>
<p>在軍車橫行，軍人藐傲，人人側目的今日，不禁使人懷想這一位儒將風度，堪稱模範的軍人！</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Marshall's Eighth Visit to Lushan Yesterday: Advocates Concurrent Discussions on Politics and Military Affairs; Ambassador Stuart and Minister Wu Exchange Views on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Special Envoy Marshall flew to Xunyang at 2:00 PM on the 13th, making his eighth ascent to Lushan. He will convey the Communist side's suggestion to convene a three-person military conference and is scheduled to return to Nanjing with Mrs. Marshall on the 16th. According to relevant sources, both Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are still making final efforts. Whether the five-person committee meeting and the three-person military conference will be temporarily shelved is currently unknown, as Marshall and Stuart have also been studying the most appropriate approach. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall believes that if the Chinese Communists propose convening a three-person military conference to discuss the ceasefire issue, then the Chinese Communists should accept the unofficial five-person committee meeting to discuss the reorganization of the government as an exchange condition, and political and military discussions should proceed concurrently. However, the spokesman for the Chinese Communist delegation stated today that the most important thing at present is still the convening of the three-person military conference to resolve the ceasefire issue. As for the unofficial five-person committee meeting, the Chinese Communists will refuse to participate until a ceasefire is guaranteed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 13th] Marshal Marshall made his eighth ascent to Guling at 6:00 PM on the 13th to spend the weekend. Mrs. Marshall, as usual, arrived half an hour earlier at Xiaotianchi to wait for him, and they both went to the Martyrs' Shrine next to the 99th Army's war memorial to pay their respects to the fallen heroes.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Ambassador Stuart, in addition to meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters at the embassy on the morning of the 13th, also hosted a luncheon for Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng at noon. They exchanged views on the current situation, and Wu and Zhang did not leave until about 2:00 PM. The originally scheduled banquet at President Song's residence at 6:00 PM was canceled due to a change of date. In addition, Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party delegation visited Fu Jingbo at 11:00 AM on the 13th, leaving after a half-hour discussion. Stuart and Zhou had originally planned to meet in the afternoon, but this was also canceled.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 12th] Regarding Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart's mediation of the Chinese peace talks, a State Department spokesman stated that the United States has suffered a temporary setback. Subsequently, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart's mediation of the Chinese peace talks, in an attempt to achieve Chinese unification, will likely encounter several setbacks, but the United States will not be disappointed in promoting cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Minister Wu Tiecheng Told Reporters Last Night That the Five-Person Committee Has Not Failed: The Government Hopes the Communist Party Will Participate and Not Create Unnecessary Complications</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Reporters, feeling confused by the Communist Party's repeated claims that the unofficial five-person committee meeting had failed, visited Wu Tiecheng, the government representative to the unofficial five-person committee meeting, on the evening of the 13th. According to him, the meeting has not failed, and the key to convening this meeting lies with the Communist Party's participation and not creating unnecessary complications by raising extraneous demands. When reporters asked about the Communist Party's assertion that there was no need to discuss the unofficial five-person committee meeting at all, Wu replied: "If they say there is no need to talk about it at all, why did they accept this proposal in the first place? Last week, the Communist Party said that after the unofficial five-person committee meeting had results, they wanted to guarantee a ceasefire. Now they say they want to hold a three-person military conference, which is really creating unnecessary complications."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] It is reported that the government and Special Envoy Marshall, in view of the failure of the three-person military committee to maintain peace in China, are quite lukewarm to the Chinese Communist's request to reopen the three-person committee, especially Marshall, who has refused to accept the request and has entrusted Ambassador Stuart to explain to the Chinese Communist Party. Both Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall have resubmitted the government's new proposal: that the Chinese Communist Party first assist in the reorganization of the National Government Committee, so that the three-person committee can simultaneously find ways to prevent rapidly escalating conflict. Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan stated that Yan'an will formally request the reopening of the three-person committee in writing and reiterate the Communist Party's position that peace must be achieved first, and then political negotiations can proceed. Currently, the Chinese Communist Party is retreating steadily in North China and urgently seeks peace, but refuses to participate in the five-person committee until a chance for peace is obtained.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan stated: No Chinese Communist officers have received training in the Soviet Union, and no Soviet representatives are stationed in Yan'an. The Chinese Communist Party has no diplomatic relations with any foreign country other than the United States through Marshall and the Peiping Military Mediation Department.</p>
<h3>Tianjin City Organizations Telegraph the US President, Requesting Continued Assistance to Our Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] The Tianjin Temporary City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Christian Association, the Fishermen's Association, the Farmers' Association, the Women's Association, the Lawyers' Association, the Education Association, the Catholic Cultural Advancement Association, the General Labor Union and other organizations, representing the 1.7 million people of Tianjin, recently telegraphed US President Truman, stating the facts, solemnly expressing deep gratitude for the United States' past assistance, and requesting that he not be misled by the clamor and propaganda of a few treacherous parties, nor be deceived by their divisive schemes. The telegram also expressed the hope that the US President would continue his past enthusiasm and provide vigorous assistance.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of US Military Personnel and Dependents Will Arrive in China Soon, Including the Wife of Lieutenant General Gillem</h3>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 13th] Although the flames of civil war are engulfing North China, the first batch of 185 dependents of US military officers and soldiers of the Military Mediation Department will still arrive at Tanggu on the 18th of this month aboard the US transport ship Ainsworth, and then transfer to a special train to Peiping. Conflicts frequently occur between Peiping and Tianjin, so heavy troops will escort them at that time, and the Military Mediation Department has obtained safety guarantees from both the Chinese Communist and Government sides. Those coming to China this time include the wife and son of Lieutenant General Gillem, and the wife and children of Brigadier General Daboldman.</p>
<h3>Brigadier General Clement Departs Qingdao to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 12th] Brigadier General Clement, Commander of the US Marine Corps in Qingdao, departed Qingdao at 4:00 PM on the 12th to return home. Before leaving, he issued a letter to the people, expressing his gratitude for the friendship and cooperation he received from all parties during his stay in Qingdao, and hoping that they would continue to cooperate in seeking world peace in the future.</p>
<h3>The US Representative of the Nantong Team is Confirmed to be Detained by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 13th] The US representative Qu Menxi and others of the Nantong Central Team (formerly the Huaiyin Executive Team), went missing on the 25th of last month after entering the area occupied by the Communist Army via Rugao from Nantong. The government and the US side have repeatedly conducted investigations, but no whereabouts have been found. According to a Mr. Zhang, a marine engineer on the Nantong Xintong Steamer, who escaped from the area occupied by the Communist Army, he once witnessed an American military officer at Zhoujiazhuang, five li northeast of Linyuan, and identified him as Qu Menxi (because he had once taken Qu Menxi to Jinhai) and two National Army officers being detained by the Communist Army, sitting on the ground. Another merchant from Shuangdian stated that the members of the Central Team are currently imprisoned by the Communist Army in the Renxiao Nunnery next to the Shuangdian Henan Elementary School, and a small motorboat is docked at Shuangdian.</p>
<h3>Wang Shijie Flew to Kunming Yesterday and Will Come to Shanghai Today to Transfer to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 13th] Minister Wang Shijie and his party of four left England on the morning of the 11th and arrived in India. They are scheduled to fly to Kunming on the 13th and, after staying for one day, will fly to Shanghai to transfer to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communist Party Obstructs Peace, Loses the Trust of the People, US Newspaper Says its Strategy is Controlled by Foreign Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The Chicago Sun published a report by its Shanghai correspondent Durrence, stating that based on the situation in China in recent weeks, the Chinese Communist Party is in a difficult situation, and the sympathy of the Chinese people for the Communist Party has disappeared. The reasons for this are, first, the people's patience with the existing disputes has reached its limit; second, they gradually believe that the Communist Party's strategy of obstructing China's peace and unity is heavily controlled by foreign countries. Durrence also pointed out that the Chinese people's intolerance and distrust of the Communist Party seem to coincide with the worldwide aversion to Soviet actions. Some upright people believe that if the Communist Party could genuinely support and assist in establishing a unified China, then they might support the Communist Party, but they are currently only being used. This is also a common feeling shared by some Chinese and foreign figures holding important positions, who are still working hard for the peace and order of this suffering country. Durrence also said: "The Communist Party's obstructionist policies, its breach of promises, the overthrow of ceasefire agreements, the murder of foreigners (especially Americans) and the habit of lying have accumulated into a huge impact: first, this has made President Chiang increasingly popular; second, it has strengthened the US policy in China." (Note: The Chicago Sun is a recognized liberal newspaper)</p>

<h3>The First Japanese War Criminal to be Executed: Takashi Sakai is Executed by Firing Squad; Tens of Thousands of People Compete to Watch the Execution at Yuhuatai</h3>
<p>— Our Nanjing Correspondent Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Yesterday, we personally witnessed a butcher who had slaughtered countless of our compatriots being executed by the firing squad of the National Defense Army on the soil of the Republic of China. He fell before us, before the mountains and valleys around the execution ground filled with standing compatriots. He was Takashi Sakai, the number one Japanese war criminal to be executed. The death sentence was pronounced before Bian Jiutian took office. At that time, he stubbornly wanted to defend himself. During those 19 days, he buried himself in the prison, writing thousands of words of defense. When this reporter visited him outside his prison cell at 1:00 PM today, he was still writing, looking very relaxed. He was not wearing any other clothes except for his underwear, and his glasses were also taken off. Things were scattered on the table, and a box of Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes was accompanying him.</p>
<p>Just as this reporter was visiting, the guarding policeman loudly asked: "What are you doing?" He replied in Chinese: "It's okay, it's not important!" It seemed that he did not know that death was imminent. According to the policemen in the war criminal detention center, he had known for a long time that he would die, but he did not know which day it would be. He often gestured to the policemen that his life was about to end. At 2:30 PM, Prosecutor Guangyu Chen of the Military Tribunal arrived and immediately issued a warrant for him. When Sakai heard the order to summon him, he immediately put on the khaki shirt, dark blue suit, black-and-white polka-dot tie, and black leather shoes that he had worn for previous court appearances. He arrived at the court at 2:45 PM. Prosecutor Chen immediately asked: "Your case has been finalized. Do you have anything to say?" He answered: "I have nothing to say here." He asked: "Do you have a will to leave to your family?" He answered: "Yes, I have written it, it is all about family matters, please be sure to send it. I have not finished organizing it yet. What time is it now? It would be best to let me finish organizing it today. If not, then forget it!" Prosecutor Chen said that time could not wait, but finally agreed to give him 30 minutes to write his unfinished will in the courtroom. Up to this point, his attitude was still pretending to be calm. When the translator was speaking, he even forced a smile, but he insisted on going back to the prison cell to write, saying that his things were very scattered. Only when Prosecutor Chen firmly refused did he shake his head, seemingly regretting that this matter could not be fulfilled, and he would not die in peace. When the writing materials were brought, he wrote with a calmer attitude, the strokes starting thin and then thick, eventually becoming so scribbled that they were unrecognizable. One letter was for "His Excellency Okamura," and the other was for "Kikue Sakai." Both started with "September 13th, 3:00 PM, suddenly executed," and then listed some money and belongings, etc. Because it was written in Japanese and hastily, it was unreadable. After finishing writing, he reorganized his clothes, including a suitcase and two bundles. Although death was imminent, his attitude in reorganizing his clothes was even more meticulous than when he was preparing his luggage before traveling overseas. This action fully demonstrated the stubbornness of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The journey began. The two large trucks of the Ministry of National Defense? were followed by the reporters' small jeeps. In Sakai's car, the guards' bayonets were lined up. The prison car passed through Huangpu Road, Guofu Road, and Zhongshan North Road to Zhonghua Gate. Along the way, the crowds watched the prison car, pointing and saying that this was a heinous war criminal. Sakai, imprisoned in the car, still calmly looked at everything. He arrived at Yuhuatai at exactly 4:00 PM. The mountains and valleys were packed with people, waiting with vengeful hearts. When Sakai got out of the car, he still forced a smile, but his face was full of paleness. His expression had been forced tight by death. On the way to the execution ground, the white gloves he had been holding were dropped on the ground. Upon reaching the execution ground, the executioner Zhou Wenjie raised his gun and fired from behind. One second after the first shot, the second shot was fired. Finally, he fell to the left, his legs apart, his eyes half-open, and his mouth open. In a few groans, he raised both hands upward, showing a struggle for survival. This was the last act. At 4:05 PM, his soul returned to the earth. The applause of the crowd resounded in the valley. Everyone felt so happy, as if they had avenged their parents and children. Afterwards, the local guards of Yuhuatai ordered the local police station to bury him. This deep-seated hatred in the hearts of millions of people was finally relieved to some extent today on the first executed war criminal. (Dispatch from Nanjing on the 13th)</p>

He lured Yao to the Hailu Hotel to cohabit and hired a lawyer to send a letter to Yao's mother to settle the matter for 2 million yuan. Yao's mother did not reply and scolded her daughter. The daughter was depressed and wanted to return home. Wang threatened her with dangerous words, making her even more anxious, and she had suicidal thoughts. At this time, Wang's situation also deteriorated, so they agreed to commit suicide together.</p>

<p>Full Text of the Declaration</p>
<p>(Continued from Yesterday's First Edition - End)</p>
<p>This war was a worldwide war against aggression. China served as the vanguard against aggression. Only China, with its spirit of disregard for success or failure, insisted on resistance, which led to the formation of the anti-aggression nations' alliance, the defeat of the fascist Axis powers, and the attainment of final victory. Although our material strength is far inferior to that of our scientifically advanced allies, our national military and civilians' moral spirit of sacrificing for truth is sufficient to be proud of to all mankind. We are the youth, the Three Principles of the People youth who are fighting for the construction of a new world. What we pray for is that the victory of this war can produce international democracy and cooperation, and promote the realization of the four freedoms of all mankind. However, looking at today's international situation, we cannot help but feel deeply anxious. The ideals proclaimed by the United Nations during their joint operations, and the Magna Carta signed, have not been fully trusted and practiced by the various United Nations nations after the victory of the war. In dealing with defeated countries and territorial issues, strong countries often place the security of one country above the security of the international community, and individual interests above collective interests. The lack of mutual trust has reduced the spirit of cooperation during wartime, which has had a deeply adverse impact on the work of world reconstruction. In the past year, "the independence of the Philippines and the establishment of the interim government of India are gratifying to us, but many major issues related to international peace have not been satisfactorily resolved or proceeded smoothly. China, which sacrificed the most and suffered the longest in the anti-aggression war, has not yet obtained full respect for its national independence, equality, and freedom after the end of the war, which is particularly painful for our national youth.</p>
<p>We are reminded of the ancient saying "A nation must insult itself before others insult it," and we cannot help but conduct a painful self-examination of the current domestic situation in our country. The purpose of our war of resistance was to seek national independence and survival, and national unity and progress. We are the Three Principles of the People youth, whose lifelong aspiration is to abide by the last words of the national father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, to struggle peacefully to save China, to seek national unity, and to maintain world peace, because we deeply believe that only by establishing a unified and strong China can we lay the foundation for peace in East Asia and guarantee world peace. However, one year after the victory, national unity and progress have been severely hindered. On the one hand, the small Chinese Communist Party supports its armed forces, not hesitating to create civil strife and divide the country, causing social and economic destruction and making reconstruction work extremely difficult. On the other hand, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry, as well as unscrupulous merchants who made fortunes during the national crisis and the victory, indulge in their insatiable desires, speculating on prices and exploiting the majority of our compatriots, making the suffering of the people after the war impossible to alleviate. These are the biggest obstacles to the Three Principles of the People. In addition to our heartache and grief, we believe that we must unite the national youth and work hard to eliminate them, so that we can overcome the current national crisis, so that the people of the whole country can truly enjoy the fruits of victory, and so that the Republic of China can permanently maintain its international status obtained through arduous resistance.

<h3>Cleanup Team to Hunt Tigers, Not to Swat Flies; Liu Wendao Receives Reporters in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] Liu Wendao, head of the Fujian-Taiwan Region Receiving Work Cleanup Team, declared at a press conference at the team's office at 3:00 PM today: Ren Weijun, director of the Monopoly Bureau, and Yu Baixi, director of the Trade Bureau, both have committed malfeasance. The team has now sent a letter to Chief Executive Chen Yi, requesting him to immediately impose administrative sanctions and transfer them to the court for prosecution. However, the details of the case have not been released. Liu also said in his written speech: As of today, the team has received a total of 384 documents, including 48 cases of housing disputes, 17 cases of land rights disputes, 63 cases of concealing materials, 64 cases of receiving malfeasance, and 5 cases of traitors. Liu stated that the team's visit to Taiwan this time is to hunt tigers, not to swat flies. Most of the cases received will be transferred to the Fujian Provincial Government and the court for handling. However, several important cases will be taken back to Nanjing for processing. The team arrived in Taiwan on August 3 and has conducted on-site investigations in five counties and six cities. They will fly back to Nanjing in the coming days to recommend that the central government send more people to come.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 13th] Regarding the malfeasance cases in the two bureaus in Taiwan Province, Chief Executive Chen Yi has recently replied to Liu Wendao, head of the Fujian-Taiwan Region Cleanup Team, accepting the team's suggestion to impose administrative sanctions on Ren Weijun, director of the Monopoly Bureau, and Yu Baixi, director of the Trade Bureau, and transfer them to the court for handling.</p>
<h3>Over 10,000 Taels of Opium Received in Wuhan Missing</h3>
<p>Cleanup Team Investigating Responsibility</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 13th] The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Region Cleanup Team recently received a tip-off that a total of 139 boxes of opium, totaling over 80,000 taels, were transferred to the Materials Handling Committee. Among them, 16 boxes, totaling over 10,000 taels, were missing, and 8 boxes were opened, indicating malfeasance. In addition to recommending that the provincial authorities quickly destroy the opium, the team is currently investigating the responsibility for the missing materials.</p>
<h3>Kunming Female Reporter Attempts to Test Love with Death</h3>
<p>Zhang Wanjun Dies from Poisoning</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 13th] Zhang Wanjun, a female intern reporter at the Fuxing Evening News, formerly named (Zhang Fangru), 20 years old, from Jian'shui, Yunnan, was previously engaged to Cai Jianya (from Hangzhou, working for the Aviation Committee). After the victory, Cai was transferred to Shanghai and urged Zhang to go there to marry him. Zhang could not leave Kunming due to financial difficulties, which led to Cai's criticism, and she had suicidal thoughts. She swallowed a large number of sleeping pills on the evening of the 11th, and was sent to the hospital for treatment on the afternoon of the 12th, but died. Ms. Zhang left a suicide note to Cai, implying that she was testing love with death.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway Passenger Transport to Officially Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 13th] The Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway passenger transport is currently being undertaken by the Hangzhou Business Office of the First Transportation Division directly under the Highway Administration Bureau. Many new passenger cars have been purchased, and the service will officially begin on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Branch Director of the Central News Agency Xu Yuanyu and Others Accused of Malfeasance; Seizing Large Amounts of Materials by Taking Advantage of Receiving Opportunities</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 13th] The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Region Cleanup Team recently released accusations against Xu Yuanyu, director of the Wuhan branch of the Central News Agency, and others, for seizing large amounts of materials by taking advantage of receiving opportunities. The entire case is divided into four parts: (A) Stealing Photographic Equipment from the Chiyo Yoko Company Operated by the Japanese: stating that over 30 tons of photographic equipment from the company were moved away by Cai Shuwen from the Central News Agency in over 30 truckloads in October last year. After the former Sixth War Zone Headquarters discovered this, it arrested Yuan Xuzu, an employee of the agency who carried out the theft, and recovered the equipment. Although the agency returned part of the equipment, a detailed inspection revealed that the quantity was less than one-tenth of the original. Based on the ratio of subsequent auction prices, the total value of the quantity that was embezzled privately was at least around 300 million yuan. Furthermore, Yuan Xuzu's confession in court and the agency's prior and subsequent protection both prove that this case was instigated by Xu Yuanyu. (B) Looting of Fang Benren's Property: stating that Xu Yuanyu privately took over 20 types of property from Fang's residence during the receiving process, the most valuable of which were five large boxes of German paint and over 30 clothing boxes. (C) Embezzlement of Revenue from the Cultural Hall: stating that after Xu Yuanyu took over the Cultural Hall, all income and expenditure statements have not been handed over, and at least 24 million yuan in revenue has not been turned over. (D) Forcibly Occupying a Car: stating that Xu Yuanyu took possession of a sedan owned by the traitor Shi Xingchuan during the receiving process and is still using it publicly. After investigating the above four cases, the team has transferred them to the Wuhan District Court Prosecutor's Office for handling and has detained Cai Shuwen for interrogation. However, Xu himself has not returned to Hankou after going to Nanjing to report on his duties. It is heard that he has been detained in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>U.S. Loans to China Totaled $67 Million This Year; Export-Import Bank Reports to Congress</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 12th] A report submitted to Congress by the Export-Import Bank shows that loans to China this year totaled $67 million in six tranches. The first loan was to the Bank of China to assist the bank in purchasing American cotton, amounting to $33 million, enough to purchase 275,000 to 300,000 bales of American cotton. The term of this loan is 24 months, starting from the date the American cotton arrives in China, guaranteed by the Chinese government. The other five loans to China totaled $33.8 million, provided to China to purchase ships, barbed wire, repair equipment and equipment for coal mining, and auxiliary power plants in the United States, with each loan as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Ten coastal freighters, totaling over US$4,243,000; (2) Sixteen freighters, US$2,600,000; (3) Railway repair equipment, US$16,650,000; (4) Ten hydropower auxiliary power plants, US$8,800,000; (5) Coal mining equipment, US$1,500,000.</p>
<p>The terms of the above loans vary depending on their use. The loan for purchasing coastal ships accounted for 75% of the selling price, and the remaining 25% was paid in cash by the Chinese government. The term of this loan was 20 years, with an interest rate of 3.5%. In April 1946, in response to President Truman's China policy statement on December 15, 1945, the Export-Import Bank prepared to lend US$500 million to various Chinese government agencies and private enterprises. However, as of June 30, 1946, the Export-Import Bank and representatives of the Chinese government had not completed the agreement to implement the loan.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Future of the Racecourse</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai citizens have been commonly paying attention to the issue being discussed in the Municipal Council: whether or not to resume horse racing. According to the estimated proposal submitted by the Municipal Government, resuming horse racing would generate a tax revenue of 2.4 billion yuan within six months. However, the mayor also stated that his intention was solely to accumulate these funds to reclaim the racecourse for proper use within two years, a "taking the wool from the sheep" approach, and not to "flatter foreigners." Thus, it can be known that the resumption of horse racing has neither anything to do with Sino-foreign relations, nor does it have a significant impact on increasing taxes to make up for deficits (the municipal government estimates a deficit of over 30 billion yuan in half a year, which definitely cannot be compensated by the meager surplus of around 2 billion yuan). Therefore, the focus should be on the mayor's policy of reclaiming the racecourse.</p>
<p>We strongly support the mayor's policy of reclaiming the racecourse. There are many reasons why the racecourse should be municipalized, and the councilors are certainly well aware of them. It is said that Councilors Feng Youzhen and Zhao Junhao have even proposed converting it into a cultural center. In the future, will this large green space beside Nanjing West Road remain a racecourse? Or will it become a cultural center? Or a large park? Or a recreation center? Or, as the mayor said, will the landowners of the Jockey Club be allowed to sell their land to build houses? The Municipal Council should give the citizens an answer!</p>
<p>But regardless of the future fate of the racecourse, what we must first point out is that before submitting this proposal, the relevant departments of the Municipal Government should first explain the following points to the citizens: What is the history of the racecourse? How many acres does the racecourse occupy? To whom does the property right of its land and buildings belong? Should it have been entirely or partially owned by the municipality? How much money from the racecourse revenue has been donated to charitable causes each year in the past? And which charitable organizations and causes have benefited? If the government wants to reclaim it, what is the current estimated value? Apart from allowing horse racing, are there absolutely no other ways for the government to prepare the funds for this purchase?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the general public, firstly, such a lively area in the central district of Shanghai really needs a place for most citizens to relax. Whether it becomes a large park or is converted into a cultural center, it definitely cannot be allowed to continue horse racing in its original location. The Municipal Government should consider the health of the general public and not solely focus on the foreign merchants of the Jockey Club, let alone only be concerned with the calculation of 2.4 billion in half a year. Secondly, if the racecourse is to be municipalized, the property rights should be clarified, a fair valuation should be made, and funds should be raised for the acquisition. Thirdly, the change in the use of the racecourse should be primarily aimed at promoting the physical and mental health of citizens, and absolutely no more alley houses should be built there, because it is essential to preserve this green space in the bustling city. Fourthly, speaking of horse racing, it is originally a form of exercise, but involving betting on horses and gambling on wins and losses, then whether it should be considered a type of "gambling" under the criminal law should first be sought in legal terms. If the council passes it rashly, wouldn't it be taking a risk? Everyone must pay attention: Shanghai no longer has concessions! Chinese law and central government orders must be considered first; it cannot be assumed that just because something existed in the concession era or exists in other countries, we can have it too!</p>
<p>Defining National Civil Aviation Policy</p>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry revoked the license of the privately-owned Dahua Aviation Company, causing it to fail to operate publicly. It is said that the issuance of this business license must wait until the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan pass civil aviation regulations, which will take a long time. Under these circumstances, the company intends to seek registration in Hong Kong, using Hong Kong and Kowloon as its base, and Shanghai will also be a major stop. At this time, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is letting General Chennault operate air transport with aviation equipment worth 3 million gold yuan. In addition to transporting relief supplies, it also intends to operate passenger and cargo transport. Before obtaining confirmation, we are unwilling to comment on whether Dahua Aviation Company is planning to register with the Hong Kong government, or whether the air transport operated by General Chennault also intends to operate passenger and cargo transport in addition to transporting relief supplies. However, the publication of this news makes us think about the policies of our country's civil aviation, which the government should determine and promulgate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Before the government decides on a civil aviation policy, what we cannot understand about the Dahua Company case is why the government's actions are so inconsistent? The relevant authorities can issue a license first, and the Executive Yuan can revoke it later. If the company suffers losses in preparation and operation, where will it seek compensation? Moreover, on the one hand, government agencies are signing contracts with Dahua Company to transport goods and passengers, and on the other hand, they are ordering it to cease operations with lightning speed. We really don't know if our government is a unified entity or not? Why play such a joke on a private airline company?</p>
<p>When it comes to civil aviation, we originally knew that even in the United Kingdom and the United States, which advocate free enterprise, strict control is adopted. In the United Kingdom, the operation of civil aviation is close to a monopoly, unlike other general enterprises, which advocate competition. The mainland of the United Kingdom is not large, and civil aviation is not as developed as in the United States, but the operation of overseas air transport is almost entirely monopolized by the British Overseas Airways Corporation, which is subject to government supervision and funding. In the United States, civil aviation is also subject to strict government control. The approval of routes and the setting of fees must be approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board. As for overseas air transport, the operation of airlines such as Pan American and Western Airlines is also subject to government supervision and control. Therefore, in the field of civil aviation, whether adopting a monopoly policy or free enterprise, it must be subject to government supervision and control, and cannot allow unregulated free competition. Our country's civil aviation industry is developing relatively late, and the scale is initially established. In the future, should we adopt a policy that is somewhat monopolistic like the United Kingdom for civil aviation? Or should we follow the example of the United States, or refer to the policies of both the United Kingdom and the United States, and formulate a policy that is suitable for our country's national conditions? This is something that really needs to be considered.</p>
<p>Speaking of our country's industrial production and economic foundation, it cannot be compared with the United States, so the American system cannot be fully adopted in the operation of air transport. However, our country has a vast territory, and land and water transportation is inconvenient, so the operation of private air transport cannot be said to be useless to the country and the people. Judging from the frequent flights operated by Dahua Aviation Company since its operation, it can be seen that it is not without demand. Currently, there are only two civil aviation companies in our country, and most of the air transport routes they operate are the same. What we need to decide now is whether to let China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) exclusively operate our country's civil air transport? Or, in addition to these two companies, should we also allow other companies to operate air transport to encourage progress through competition? If a monopoly protection policy is adopted, then the relevant departments' issuance of a license to Dahua Company in the past should be held responsible for the mistake. If an open policy is adopted, then strict control must be exercised on the approval of routes and the setting of fares, and the Legislative Yuan should promptly determine regulations. Our country's civil aviation industry is just beginning, and we hope that the government can adopt appropriate policies for civil aviation, maintain this emerging industry, and avoid delays and hesitation, so that young people who are enthusiastic about aviation will not be confused.</p>
<p>Advocating Just Diplomacy</p>
<p>At the stage when the Paris Peace Conference entered its seventh week, our representative Yu Junji declared in the Italian Economic Committee that although Italy had obtained huge amounts of reparations from our country after the so-called Boxer Rebellion in 1900, our country was unwilling to seek compensation for this war from Italy. The issue of compensation for the losses suffered by our country in the war against Italy will be resolved through negotiations between China and Italy. Yu also reviewed the issue of compensation, urging all countries seeking compensation not to make compensation demands that exceed Italy's ability to pay. Because today's enemy is tomorrow's friend; if excessive compensation is demanded from the conquered, it will cause their collapse, which is certainly not the way to world peace. "We must have a long-term vision to win peace." This statement is sufficient to reflect our national spirit of benevolence and tolerance, which is unanimously agreed by the people of the whole country. The Chinese people have always treated others with loyalty and forgiveness, and do not haggle over gains and losses; the abandonment of demanding reparations is the best manifestation of our national virtues.</p>
<p>The same spirit is not only reflected in the abandonment of reparations demands from Italy, but also in the overall attitude of our country towards the defeated countries. On the eve of his departure from Paris, Foreign Minister Wang told visiting reporters, "Peace cannot last unless it is based on justice, and justice means that all weak countries and defeated countries should be treated fairly." Regarding our country's attitude towards defeated Japan, Wang stated frankly: "China does not believe in a policy of revenge. China provides assistance to Japanese democrats and allows them to consolidate their position." From the statements of Foreign Minister Wang and Representative Yu Junji, it can be seen that our foreign policy is based on justice and originates from benevolence. All of this is the lofty ideal of our country, and it is indeed a matter of gratification that our foreign policy can be consistent with the spirit of our country.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the current international situation, suspicion and doubt have become a widespread phenomenon; even the victorious countries are only focused on fostering and supporting their own interests in preparation for future troubles. In fact, after two great disasters, despite the invention of the atomic bomb, there has been no significant improvement in ideological consciousness. As an ancient country with a rich culture, we may not be able to catch up with others in terms of material production, but how can we be content to lag behind in the recognition of spiritual values? The advocacy of "just diplomacy" is almost like a voice in an empty valley in today's era of power worship; but if we look at it from a long-term perspective, how can diplomacy without justice win lasting peace? In today's world, we need more advocacy and practice of "just diplomacy." Only in this way can we save humanity from the future disaster of war.</p>

<h3>Achieving China's Peaceful Unification and Maintaining the Open Door Policy: Wallace Elaborates on U.S. Foreign Policy, Based on Understanding and Coordination with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, December 12] U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace recently stated in a speech here that for the sake of world peace and the interests of the Soviet Union, world peace requires China to maintain a transcendent position, standing outside any sphere of influence, both politically and economically. We insist that in China, as in the entire world, the door to trade and economic development opportunities must be fully opened. Continuing to speak on China, Wallace reiterated the United States' hope for a united government, stating that unless there is a unified and peaceful China, built on the cooperation of all groups in the country and based on a policy of non-interference, the open door to trade and economic development opportunities in China is meaningless. His words are open to various interpretations.</p>
<p>Wallace's speech tonight was not entirely to the liking of some left-wing and progressive liberal elements, especially the Communist Party, because Wallace also made sharp remarks about the political activities of the Communist Party in the United States, South America, and Western Europe. Wallace stated that the Soviet Union does not need to incite local Communist Parties in Western Europe, South America, and the United States, just as we do not interfere in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. He stated in his speech that the Soviet Union should stop spreading its communist form, which must, even if necessary, defeat democratic countries by force. At the same time, we should turn a deaf ear to those among us who want us to believe that the Soviet Union's communism and our free enterprise system cannot coexist and prosper. He further warned that the Soviet Union must know that we are not planning a war against the Soviet Union, and we are certain that the Soviet Union is not expanding its territory or ruling the world through communist parties around the world. It is said that Wallace's remarks against the Soviet Union and the Communist Party were intended as a propaganda attack by the Republican Party on the Democratic government's appeasement of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, December 13] U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace, in a speech at a meeting of the Independent Professional Committee here, advocated that the United States adopt an impartial foreign policy. He stated that New York Governor Dewey recently made a speech advocating Anglo-American defense, but I think it is not so. The United States should not rely on the atomic bomb and conclude a military alliance with the United Kingdom. Anyone who relies on atomic warfare will sooner or later suffer from it. British imperialism in the Near East and the Soviet Union's retaliation policy will lead the United States directly into the vortex of war. Unless the United States formulates its own clear and realistic policy, it can be avoided. The price of peace cannot be estimated in gold yuan. The United States should send technicians and release credit loans to assist the industrialization of other countries, especially China and India. The United States' current protectionist trade policy is inappropriate. In terms of relations with the Soviet Union, it is unwise to befriend the former Axis powers on the one hand and haggle with the Soviet Union on the other. Some reactionary elements once firmly believed in the victory of the Axis powers. At this moment, they express friendship to the United States, but these people are still working hard to cultivate war between the United States and the Soviet Union. These people do not truly welcome the United States, but only want to make the United States and the Soviet Union destroy each other. We must recognize that the United States does not care about Eastern European affairs, just as the Soviet Union does not care about Latin American affairs. A policy of understanding and coordination with the Soviet Union should be the basis of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, December 13] President Truman declared yesterday that he basically agreed with the spirit of Wallace's speech, advocating respect for the Soviet Union, and that Wallace's views did not conflict with the policies promoted by Secretary of State Byrnes.</p>
<h3>London Expresses Deep Surprise at Wallace's Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, December 13] President Truman announced today that he fully agreed with Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech on foreign policy in New York, and that its content did not contradict the views of Secretary of State Byrnes. However, diplomatic authorities here have speculated that the speech will have far-reaching effects. The focus of attention in diplomatic circles is Wallace's advocacy of frankly acknowledging the existence of U.S. and Soviet spheres of influence, and seeking to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union on this basis.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, December 13 broadcast: A British Foreign Office spokesman expressed deep surprise at U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech, and the fact that President Truman apparently agreed with Wallace's views was noteworthy. The spokesman did not understand what kind of interpretation should be given to Wallace's so-called "British imperialism." At a time when Britain recognizes India's independence and British troops are withdrawing from Iran as scheduled, there is no possibility of war between Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Wartime Military Cooperation Between Britain and the United States Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, December 13] President Truman disclosed today that wartime military cooperation between the United States and Britain will not change for the time being. The President met with reporters today and was asked whether it could be assumed that the Combined Chiefs of Staff would continue to exist until the formal declaration that the war had ended. The President replied: "Of course." The Combined Chiefs of Staff is a group composed of senior army and navy generals from the United States and Britain, who jointly planned and conducted World War II.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Negotiations Between the United States and Australia to Ensure Pacific Security</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sydney, December 12, United Press] Negotiations between the United States and Australia on a Pacific security agreement that would allow the two countries to use each other's Pacific bases have been officially confirmed today. Australian Prime Minister Chifley has announced that U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Australian Representative Beasley, who are currently in Paris, are actively discussing this plan, but this discussion is still in its preliminary stages.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union is Carrying Out Construction Work in the Kuril Islands</h3>

<h3>Improvement in US Labor-Management Relations: West Coast Seamen End Slowdown, Truman Authorizes Steelman to Mediate, Some New York Truck Drivers Return to Work</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] Labor Secretary Schwellenbach’s special representative, Feinsinger, announced: The strike of seamen belonging to the West Coast Labor Association has ended. The slowdown stopped after shipowners guaranteed that recently collectively bargained wage increases would take effect immediately. A spokesman for the Industrial Organizations Congress Seafarers Union in San Francisco said: Seamen belonging to the union will strike from midnight onwards, seeking the same treatment as seamen in the West Coast Labor Association. In addition, the Seafarers International Union’s members are still continuing their slowdown. Earlier reports stated that, although the White House suggested a solution, all striking seamen voted to continue the slowdown until the government guaranteed that wage increases negotiated with shipowners were approved.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 12th] White House Press Secretary Ross said today that President Truman has authorized Economic Stabilization Director Steelman to handle the seamen's labor dispute.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] The White House today bypassed the Wage Stabilization Board and proposed its own solution to the seamen's labor dispute. The demands of the striking seamen of the American Federation of Labor will be fully approved. However, it remains questionable how long the labor dispute will continue. Some shipowners have not yet expressed their position, and the Industrial Organizations Congress Seafarers Union is also vowing to obtain the same treatment as the American Federation of Labor seamen. These are all obstacles to an early return to work.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Two developments today have reduced the severity of the labor disputes in the United States: (1) A portion of the 30,000 truck drivers in New York, who have been slowing down for twelve days demanding wage increases and shorter working hours, have resumed work today following a union order. New York Mayor O'Dwyer said that leaders of the three unions have assured him that trucks from the four major food wholesalers and one transportation company will be ordered back to work. (2) Meanwhile, Economic Stabilization Director Steelman today consulted with the Wage Stabilization Board on the matter of raising the wages of 500,000 seamen. White House Press Secretary Ross said that Steelman has the power to decide whether to maintain wage stabilization or reject the seamen's decision to increase wages. Steelman's decision, after approval by President Truman, will be effective.</p>

<h3>Arab Nations Firmly Oppose Partition of Palestine, Three Arab Political Elders Meet to Seek Compromise Solution</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] In today’s two closed sessions of the Palestine Conference, representatives of the Arab nations firmly opposed Britain’s plan for autonomy of the Palestinian provinces. After lengthy debate, no concessions were made. In the next phase of the conference, Arab representatives will present their plan for Palestine in detail. It is expected that the continued implementation of the 1939 British Government White Paper policy, namely, the complete cessation of Jewish immigration to Palestine, will be the minimum demand of the Arab peoples. British Foreign Secretary Bevin did not attend the second meeting today, but he reviewed the opinions expressed by the Arab representatives in the Foreign Office. He will present a response when the conference resumes next Monday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 12th] It is reported that three senior Arab politicians departed today for Baghdad to engage in negotiations to find a solution that could make the London Conference successful. King Abdullah of Transjordan has departed for Iraq, where he is said to be meeting with former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri and Arab Executive Committee member Hilmi. This discussion will be based on the independence of the Palestinian Arabs, while also recognizing some Jewish territorial rights. If the three can reach an agreement on basic policy, a treaty can be established between Iraq, Transjordan, and the Arabs of Palestine to form a coalition, which could open a path for the London Conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] It has just been learned that Britain has decided to recognize the Arab League as a diplomatic entity and has invited it to send diplomatic representatives.</p>

<h3>Zhao Zukang Reports on Public Works: "Emergency System" Implemented in the Past Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Senate held its seventh meeting this morning, where Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang reported on the Public Works Bureau's policies. He stated that the bureau is responsible for eight types of projects: roads, ditches, houses, parks, bridges, docks, rivers, and dikes. In the year since taking over, he felt that both the quantity and quality were insufficient. The city's roads are about 1,000 kilometers long, with more than 300 kilometers being asphalt roads and the rest being cinder and gravel roads. Their quality and pavement height are not up to standard. According to the municipal construction regulations promulgated by the central government, the road area should account for 20% of the city's area. Shanghai's total area is 890 square kilometers. According to the central government's regulations, the road area should be increased tenfold. In terms of ditches, the total length of sewage and rainwater ditches should be 1,800 kilometers, which is also insufficient. In terms of housing, Shanghai has more than 4 million people and 700,000 households. The city should have at least 500,000 to 600,000 houses to be sufficient, but there are only 300,000 to 400,000 houses now. During the Anti-Japanese War, more than 30,000 houses in Nanshi and Zhabei were destroyed, making the quantity even more insufficient. In terms of parks, the city currently has 14 parks, covering an area of ​​about 1,000 acres, which should also be increased at least tenfold based on the population and city area. In terms of bridges, Shanghai has a total of 670 bridges, with more than 200 important ones, but there are no bridges on the Huangpu River. Most of the docks are owned by private individuals and foreign merchants, while the municipal government only owns more than 20 docks. Rivers are divided into four levels, with the first level being the Huangpu River, Suzhou Creek, and Yunzao Creek, and the second level having 16 rivers. In terms of dikes, the western dike from Qiujiang Wharf north to Binshan is safe, while the eastern dike from Caotou'an at the mouth of the Huangpu River to Huangjiawan in Chuansha County is mostly collapsed. In short, the quantity of public works projects in this city is insufficient, and the destruction was even greater after eight years of occupation. The difficulties of the bureau's work are: 1. Lack of organization of ditches and roads. 2. Too much destruction. 3. Incomplete drawings. 4. Lack of technicians. 5. Difficulty in purchasing materials. 6. Limited funding.</p>
<p>As for the implementation of work in the past year, in general, what has been done is the four words "emergency system," meaning the projects that need to be done urgently in engineering and the establishment of various basic systems in public works, based on the past situation, and hoping that the Senate will assist the Public Works Bureau in increasing funding, etc.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Staff Have Corrupt Behavior, Delaying the Issuance of Licenses and Soliciting "Facilitation Fees," Senators Raise Questions One After Another</h3>
<p>As soon as Director Zhao finished his report, Senator Zhao Yangxiong raised two questions: (1) "Regarding the housing shortage, I remember Director Zhao promising in the Provisional Senate to build 3,000 public housing units, with the required funds advanced by the Farmers Bank. But today, one year later, only 145 units have been built, which is too far from the number of 3,000. At that time, Director Zhao planned to order more mobile homes from abroad. How many have been purchased now? Where have they been erected? (2) Regarding the problem of water accumulation on roads, once there is heavy rain in this city, the lower-lying roads become swamps. This city is an international metropolis, which is really undignified, and it is especially inconvenient for citizens. Therefore, drainage projects must overcome all difficulties and be completed in the short term." He also requested the rapid removal of obstacles left by the enemy in Nanshi and other places. Senator Zhao's standard Mandarin was crisp and pleasant to listen to, and his questions received applause from the entire audience. Jin Hongxiang began to speak, denouncing the bureau chiefs for pushing the blame for matters that should have been done but were not done to economic difficulties. Senator Jin said that things depend on people's efforts. Dr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Republic of China, and Chairman Chiang led the war of resistance. The difficulties and hardships are self-evident. The lack of funds was originally conceivable, but it was eventually achieved. He hoped that future reports would mention less economic difficulties. Senator Jin finished speaking, and the entire audience applauded to show their support. Following this, Ma Shaoquan and Sun Zhenchun raised questions that in today's serious housing shortage, the Public Works Bureau not only does not provide convenience to the real estate industry to build houses, but also creates difficulties everywhere. Ma cited an example saying: On the empty lot at the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Jianguo Road, the owner of the land, a real estate company, has designed and built more than 30 houses. After the drawings were sent to the bureau for revision, the building permit was only issued after six weeks. Because construction is time-sensitive, being delayed by the Public Works Bureau for six weeks means that the entire project cannot be completed this year. There are many similar situations. There are some who have not been issued permits for nine weeks. Looking back at the former concession period, after reviewing the design drawings, the permit could be issued in a maximum of two weeks. Now, the staff of the Public Works Bureau intentionally delay the issuance of permits, and their intentions are very suspicious. Senator Sun added that when the Public Works Bureau issues construction permits, there is corrupt behavior such as soliciting "facilitation fees." The entire audience expressed great concern about this shocking statement.</p>
<h3>Reports from Various Bureaus Are Not Candid Enough</h3>
<p>Senator Fei Shusheng, a cadre of the Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, made a statement of感想 before asking questions, saying: "The reports from the bureau chiefs are not candid enough." He asked four questions: (1) The Public Works Bureau should have a concrete plan for repairing roads and flood control projects and complete them within a limited time. (2) Is there any corruption among the staff in the bureau? If so, how will it be dealt with? (3) Zhongzheng Middle Road (formerly Avenue Foch) has been repaired, but it was damaged again after being washed away by rain. Is there any malfeasance in the construction? (4) The housing shortage is so serious, please investigate whether there is any manipulation, etc. Senator Chen Linsheng spoke on behalf of the suburban citizens, requesting that the road surface and bridges on Pudong Avenue be repaired as soon as possible, and saying: "The current municipal authorities ignore the suburbs and only focus on the former concession area. However, the suburban area is 700 times the size of the former concession area, and the residents account for one-third of the city's population. The construction of the suburbs is at least 50 years behind the former concession area. I hope that the municipal authorities will pay more attention to the suburban construction in the future." Roads Directorate Ma Junshuo asked questions about public housing, (1) There is a lot of public land in the city government, so why is the recently built public housing built in remote areas? (2) According to estimates, each unit is worth a maximum of 2 million yuan, why is it sold for 3 million yuan? Can it be rented out? In summary, the main points of the senators' questions can be divided into: (1) housing shortage and public housing, (2) road construction, (3) road drainage projects, (4) suburban transportation. The senators' questions were very enthusiastic. Due to limited time, Speaker Pan announced the suspension of questioning at 11:25 am and asked Director Zhao to answer the previously asked questions first.</p>
<h3>Director Zhao Answers One by One</h3>
<p>Director Zhao immediately stepped onto the podium and answered one by one, saying: "The drainage plan has been formulated. Part of the Fahua Creek has been dredged. Currently, the Xu Jiahui drainage area south of Fahua Creek is under construction. However, funds are difficult, and prices are high. One meter of cement pipe is worth 250,000 yuan. The total length of the city's ditches is 590 kilometers, so repairing even a small part of it is very expensive. Road resurfacing is also limited by machinery, materials, and technicians, and we cannot do whatever we want. The original price of public housing is only 1.48 million yuan per unit, plus elementary school (a school is attached to the public housing area), roadbed, water and electricity, and other ancillary projects. The total cost is 2.28 million yuan per unit on average. If the second batch is built again, it may not be possible without 3 million yuan. Therefore, it was passed by the Municipal Council that the price per unit is set at 3 million yuan. Temporary projects in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas have now begun to be sorted out, but the basic projects must wait until the route plan is coordinated with the urban design before construction can begin. As for the obstacles in the Nanshi and other areas, the garrison headquarters instructed that they be temporarily delayed for demolition. As for the construction permit, it is issued by the competent department and competent section. If there is no land ownership dispute and the route design is not a problem, the permit can be issued. If there is corruption or other circumstances, please report it, and it will be dealt with severely. In the past, two staff members committed fraud and were immediately dismissed." He also said that the Caobang Bridge will be completed within half a month, the Shanxi Road Bridge will be repaired first, and the Fujian Road Bridge will be postponed. Finally, he said that the bureau's current policies are emergency and institutional. Emergency is the target of the target, and the system is the basis of the basis. He also hoped that the Senate would provide more supervision. Director Zhao finished his answer and it was noon at 12:00. Speaker Pan announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Policy Report: Zhao Zengjue Describes Six Points in Detail</h3>
<p>Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue reported on the policies implemented between April and August of this year, divided into six items: electricity, water supply, gas, transportation, telephone, and ferries. He proposed how to eliminate the possible electricity panic between October of this year and January of next year, solve the water supply difficulties in West Shanghai, increase the gas supply, control the traffic in the central district, add telephones in various districts, and purchase more ferries, etc.</p>
<p>Electricity Problem</p>
<p>Electricity is the source of power for all of Shanghai and is of deep concern to all citizens. Before the war, Shanghai's electricity reached 260,000 kilowatts. After the war, all of Pudong was lost, Zhabei and Nanshi lost 70%, and the foreign electricity company lost 25%. When it was taken over last year, there was a sense of electricity panic. Foreign and Zhabei power plants are actively repairing, but the machines sent to the United States for repair will not be completed until February next year due to the impact of the American strike. Currently, two-thirds of Shanghai's electricity is supplied to industrial users, with the most supplied to textile mills. The future plan is to complete the Greater Shanghai Ring Power Grid, and everything will be standardized. Regarding the adjustment of electricity prices, the uniformity of the city is a mistake. Because in the future, Shanghai Electric Power Company, French Electric Power Company, Zhabei, and Pudong Electric Power Company will all generate electricity separately. Because the conditions are not uniform, the electricity prices should not be the same. At present, the national electricity price is the lowest in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Water Supply Problem</p>
<p>The West Shanghai area is currently the most serious, because the number of houses and factories in West Shanghai has more than doubled compared to before the war. The Public Utilities Bureau is actively preparing to establish a West Shanghai water plant.</p>
<p>Gas Problem</p>
<p>The British Gas Company supplies 3.5 million cubic feet per month, which is used by about 20,000 households, but it is still not enough. The solution is to tighten the amount of usage and purchase high-quality coal with strong volatility. At present, the gas company not only supplies gas, but also supplies coke and asphalt. In the future, if foreign coal is used, the gas price may need to be adjusted. The Technical Committee is planning to set up a high-pressure gas network, which will be completed within five years.</p>
<p>Transportation Problem</p>
<p>The transportation problem in the central district is extremely difficult and cannot be solved by plans in the office. The crux of the problem must be studied on the ground. Solving the traffic in the central district requires solving the transportation problems in other districts at the same time. I hope that the Senate will help solve the traffic difficulties in the central district. On sunny days, 65% of Shanghainese walk on the road, which is about 2.7 million people. 1,600 public vehicles are needed to solve the transportation problem, but currently there are only a quarter of them. The current plan focuses on opening up north-south traffic, and the routes must be average, passing through both busy and remote areas. Trams and buses are integrated.</p>
<p>Telephone Problem</p>
<p>At present, the Ministry of Communications' Telecommunications Bureau manages the telephones in Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the city center, while the labyrinthine telephones in the old two concessions are operated by the American Telephone Company, so communication is sometimes difficult. Shanghai needs a highly efficient telephone network. Now, the Telephone Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, and the American Telephone Company have each sent two people to form a committee (convened by Director Zhao) to discuss the city's telephone problems. It was decided to divide the area within a 10-kilometer radius of the North Station into four zones. In the future, the central district telephone numbers will be changed to six digits.</p>
<p>Ferry Problem</p>
<p>Before the war, there were a total of 14 ferries, but currently there are only 8, and one is under repair. The number of people taking ferries per month is 1.2 million, while before the war it was only 500,000. Therefore, the order is poor. It is planned to expand the ferry business in an enterprise manner, organize a ferry company, and cooperate with truck transportation to build warehouses in Pudong and promote Pudong.</p>
<p>Finally, Director Zhao said: If foreign exchange is used to acquire foreign public utility enterprises, it will only increase the consumption of foreign exchange. Foreign businessmen will use this fund to set up factories in Japan, Hong Kong, India, and other places, which will not benefit our country.</p>

<h3>City Government Levy Donations and Taxes: Senators Have Different Views</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Regarding the two proposals submitted by the mayor to increase house donations and hold municipal donations, the third review committee preliminarily resolved the previous day to levy municipal donations instead of increasing house donations. According to reporters' further solicitation of opinions from some senators yesterday, Senator Zhu Wende believes that municipal donations are modeled after the methods of the former工部局era. He does not object to the levy of municipal donations, but it is worth considering whether it is appropriate to use the old method. Senators Chen Cunren and Yang Fusheng expressed their opinion on municipal donations: If the government does use them for municipal construction and has a concrete plan, then they do not object to the levy. Senators Zhao Diqun and Zhang Yiqu also opposed increasing house donations, because it is easy to stimulate prices and affect the entire lives of citizens. But creating a levy on municipal donations, because municipalities contain construction, is an obligation that citizens should fulfill.</p>
<p>Senators Su Shuxiong and Wang Weiyu advocated increasing house donations. Their main reason is that house donations are direct taxes, the collection procedures are convenient, and they can make the rich pay more and the poor pay less. Shen Ding's opinion: If you want to increase donations and taxes, you must clarify their purpose. The city government's overspending is mostly personnel expenses, so how should the staffing be? The city government must first determine this so that we know, and the work plan must also be taken out first for future verification.</p>
<h3>Receiving Tap Water Requires "National Currency" to Pave the Way; Zhao Zengjue Responds to Interpellations, Further Investigation Pending</h3>
<p>After the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zengjue, finished his report, the oral interpellations began. Due to time constraints, those who did not have time to interpellate were postponed to this morning. The interpellation by Ma Shaoquan regarding the installation of tap water was the most remarkable. In order to solve the housing shortage, Mr. Ma built a new house and requested to connect the tap water, but after three weeks, there were still no results. Initially, Mr. Ma's friend told him that everything in Shanghai is based on "business acumen" and that "national currency" must be used to pave the way. Mr. Ma had no choice but to spend 200,000 yuan in tips, but after three weeks, the connection was still not completed. Moreover, it is said that if you don't pay a tip, when calculating the cost of connecting the water pipes, they often take a big detour. In fact, the water pipe could be connected near Jike Mountain, but the result is that it costs more and takes longer. In addition to questioning, Mr. Ma also stated that the delay in official matters only increases the opportunity for extortion. He also asked if it was possible to connect the water pipe within five hours. Director Zhao's response was very brief, saying that the procedures for requesting the installation of tap water were extremely complicated. As for the detailed actual situation, he will provide a written response after investigation, and he will pay special attention to it in the future.</p>
<p>Zhong Yuliang questioned: The No. 6 municipal ferry has been under repair for ten months, and it has not been repaired yet. I don't know when it can be repaired or when it can operate. What are the chief engineers, deputy engineers, trainee engineers, and engineers doing? The response was: This ship was received from the navy. All the internal machinery was missing. After a newspaper advertisement, it was found at the Jiangnan Shipyard. However, there were many missing parts. Because it was made in Germany, it was difficult to purchase them, so they all had to be made in-house, which took a lot of time. As for personnel, it is roughly the same as before the war, but the business side has been reduced by eight people. The technical side has only increased by eight people.</p>
<p>Tao Guangchuan asked: (1) The lights in the Nanshi area are very dim. Can they be improved? (2) Every night after 10 pm and before 6 am, the Nanshi telephone often cannot be connected for one or two hours. How can it be improved? (3) How to solve the crowding and disorder on trams and buses? (4) It is difficult to install telephones. Can more public telephones be set up, or can more private telephone extensions be added? (5) The authorities have decided to ban rickshaws in two years. What plans are there for future transportation? Director Zhao replied: We are striving for a rational solution to the telephone problem in Nanshi. The telephones in that area are managed by the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. The Ministry of Transportation and the municipal government are on an equal footing, and the municipal government can only notify them at any time and has no right to manage them. The crowding of public vehicles will gradually be resolved. The poor order is indeed due to the fact that armed comrades do not abide by the rules, which has greatly affected good people. I sincerely hope that the senators will make more appeals in terms of public opinion. Regarding the ban on rickshaws, it is a central government order. There is already an official document reaching the municipal government, saying that if the ban is not implemented after October, it will be considered disobedience.</p>
<h3>Automobile Licenses · Employees Accepting Bribes</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhi inquired: The newspaper reported that in order to develop the city's transportation, the Public Utilities Bureau ordered forty buses from overseas. After they arrived, they were not suitable and needed to be modified, but the modification cost exceeded the price of the cars, so they bought new cars instead. Who should be responsible for this, and how is it being resolved now? It is also rumored that lower-level employees of the Public Utilities Bureau accepted bribes and removed some fake automobile license cards so that cars purchased from the puppet regime could be re-registered. Were the automobile license cards complete when the Public Utilities Bureau took over? The response was: The Public Utilities Bureau did not order buses from abroad. We are paying close attention to automobile license matters. Please report any illegal activities. If there is any illegality, we will definitely deal with it severely. At the same time, we will severely punish corruption and reward integrity. Shanghai is a society with money and power. Some people use money and power to induce others. Please pay more attention to it.</p>
<p>Lu Shidao inquired: The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company can now generate more than 4,000 kilowatts. It is said that it has a contract with the Shanghai Electric Power Company to return half of the electricity generated to that company. The remaining 2,000 kilowatts, in addition to being used for public purposes and factories directly related to people's livelihood, can still have more than 1,500 kilowatts left. According to the regulations of the Industrial Electricity Review Committee (chaired by Director Zhao), it should be distributed equally to various private factories. Now it is said that all of it has been allocated to the Tianli Nitrous Gas Factory, and more than 130 other factories have not received any. What is the legal basis for this? The response was: Zhabei Water and Electricity generates 4,700 kilowatts, of which 700 kilowatts are for self-use, and 2,000 kilowatts are returned to the Shanghai Electric Power Company according to the contract. The rest is allocated to the Central Printing Factory, the Central Mint, the Fuxin Flour Mill, etc., totaling 1,147 kilowatts. As for the Tianli Nitrous Gas Factory, other solutions need to be found.</p>
<h3>Trams Not Stopping at Stations · Urge the Company to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Senator Zhai stated: I have a few simple questions: (1) Ask the military police to help remove and correct armed comrades who do not obey the rules on trams. (2) The current tram stations are extremely inconvenient for passengers. (3) Trams do not stop at stations. (4) The progressive telephone charging system is unreasonable. The response was: The tram stations will be investigated, and the tram companies will be urged to pay attention to trams not stopping at stations. The progressive telephone charging system aims to discourage excessive and unnecessary calls.</p>
<p>Other interpellations are briefly described below: The tram preparation office of the Public Utilities Bureau plans to supplement and improve the unreasonable situation of the city's transportation. The British-owned trolleybuses have ninety vehicles that cannot be used because they lack rubber tires. Twenty French-owned buses are expected to arrive by the end of October. The Public Utilities Bureau will add one bus route every month.</p>
<h3>Alternate Senators Request Permission to Speak · The Ministry of Interior Replies by Telegram, Denying the Request</h3>
<p>Before holding this session of the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council received letters from more than ten alternate senators, including Yang Zhiqian, requesting to attend and speak. Because this request did not comply with the central government's regulations, the council telegraphed the Ministry of Interior for instructions. The Ministry of Interior recently replied by telegram, stating that it should be handled according to the original regulations and denying the request. The Ministry of Interior's telegram is copied below: "Shanghai Municipal Council, your telegram has been received. It should be handled in accordance with the original interpretation of the Yuan telegram. Ministry of Interior, Minjia Seal."</p>
<h3>Education and Social Affairs Bureau to Report on Policy Implementation Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the agenda of the Municipal Council today, the morning session will feature a report by Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau (Director Gu Yuxiu is in Europe), and the afternoon session will feature a report by Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau. In addition to senators' interpellations and bureau directors' responses during today's session, Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau will continue to respond to unfinished interpellations. Five representatives will also be elected to participate in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui receiving work inspection team.</p>
<h3>Recover the Racecourse · Rebuild as a Cultural City · Proposals by Feng Youzhen and Zhao Junhao · Property Rights Issues · The Assembly Has Requested the Land Bureau to Investigate</h3>
<p>The racecourse issue has become a focus of interest for the Municipal Council. It is expected that when the case is brought to the assembly for discussion, a fierce debate will occur. According to a reporter's inquiry: Senators Feng Youzhen and Zhao Junhao, produced by the Journalists Association, proposed to the assembly yesterday to recover all real estate of the racecourse and rebuild it as a Shanghai Cultural City. They suggested that all the buildings and grounds of the racecourse be taken over by the city and rebuilt into a meaningful cultural center, called Shanghai Cultural City, in order to establish a century-long plan for the development and construction of Shanghai. First, a Shanghai Cultural City Construction Committee will be established, with several members recommended by the Municipal Council and well-known Chinese and foreign figures invited to jointly plan it. The city will be divided into three parts: (1) The Municipal Council will be established. (2) A cultural center will house all cultural and academic groups in the city, such as libraries, museums, revolutionary historical materials exhibition halls, as well as the Journalists Association, the Municipal Education Association, cultural and artistic groups, opera houses, etc. (3) A square will be opened as Roosevelt Stadium to commemorate the great achievements of the late US President Roosevelt, so that citizens can have a place to exercise their bodies. It is said that dozens of senators have jointly signed their support for the proposal.</p>
<p>In addition, the issue of restoring horse racing in Shanghai, submitted by Mayor Wu for discussion, has attracted much attention from all sectors. The discussion in the Municipal Council is very heated and has not yet been decided. However, in order to understand the true situation of the property rights of the racecourse, the Municipal Council has specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Government's Land Administration Bureau for a thorough investigation and response, as a reference for discussing the horse racing issue.</p>
<h3>Police Chief Tang Zong Visited a Fire Drill Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After inspecting various departments of the Municipal Police Bureau the day before, Police Chief Tang Zong visited a fire drill by the Fire Department last night. The location was in front of the Municipal Government gate on Jiangxi Road. First, police officers stood guard around the area. Then, Ye Binyong, Section Chief of the Fire Department, arranged everything and diligently greeted reporters, explaining the situation of the Fire Department in detail. At about 7:50 pm, Chief Tang arrived accompanied by Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, and Zhou Zhaoxiang, Director of the Fire Department. The performance then began. First, three Pu Fire Engines came from the south on Jiangxi Road and drove to the destination. Then, two ladder trucks, two scaling ladder, two lighting trucks, one ambulance, one rescue truck, and one hose truck arrived one after another. Firefighters came and went like weaving, each doing their own job, or climbing the ladder to a height of one hundred and ten feet. Seven searchlights illuminated the area as if it were daytime. Meanwhile, police officers held huge water hoses and sprayed water to extinguish the fire on the second floor of the Municipal Government. A house was set up on the side of the road, and the interior was filled with smoke. Actors tried to open the windows, and police officers wearing smoke hoods entered through the windows and rescued the person who had fainted inside, carrying them onto the ambulance and driving them to the hospital for treatment. The police officers were well-trained and moved quickly. At 8:10 pm, the wonderful performance came to an end.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Housing Leasing Management · Compulsory Enforcement After Mediation Fails</h3>
<p>Ma Junshuo Believes There is a Flaw in the Division of Judicial Power</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] During this period of severe housing shortage, there are many disputes between landlords and tenants. Therefore, the Municipal Government has specially formulated a new regulation called "Regulations on Housing Leasing Management," which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. It was also submitted to the tenth group of the Municipal Council for review the day before. According to Senator Ma Junshuo, the review committee will conduct a serious study of the case, because the regulations mention that the Municipal Government can enforce compulsory enforcement after mediation fails. In fact, according to the law, this point has a flaw in the division of judicial power. The right of enforcement belongs to the judicial organ, and the administrative organ has no right to enforce it. These regulations are currently planned to be trialed in Nanjing for one year, but the situations in Shanghai and Nanjing are different. Since the Municipal Council has the right to review the Municipal Government's regulations, it is necessary to consider these regulations.</p>
<h3>The Assembly Passed a Resolution · Decided to Participate in the Investigation Team · The Number of People Caused an Increase to Five</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The problem of "participating in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui receiving work investigation team," which had been causing disagreements among the senators for days, was finally resolved by a two-thirds vote at yesterday's session. Of the 138 senators, 115 voted to participate. Before the vote, Speaker Pan first reported that Zhang Zhiben, the leader of the investigation team, had seen in the newspaper that he was to be consulted, so he rushed over without waiting for the telegram to be sent. After the speaker contacted him, he decided to extend the working period to the end of the month. At the same time, he could invite three senators to participate.</p>
<p>Then Zhuang He's opinion received a round of warm applause. He said: The general public has great expectations for us. If we don't participate, how can we avoid disappointing the public? If we have a way to avoid disappointing the public, then it doesn't matter if we don't participate. As for the selection of personnel, if we want to participate, every senator is qualified, but those who have been involved in receiving work in the past year cannot participate. I myself am the Director of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Executive Committee, and I am also involved in receiving work, so I am not qualified to participate. The Municipal Party Committee itself is an institution being investigated. This brings us to Senator Feng's previous proposal to recommend Senator Zhan Wenhuxu from the press. I don't think it is appropriate, because Senator Zhan is a receiving personnel from the Central Propaganda Department. We should recommend someone who has no connection with receiving work.</p>
<p>Feng Youzhen thought it made sense, so he said that his previous proposal to recommend a lawyer, an accountant, and someone from the press has been formally overturned, since Senator Zhan is also one of the receiving personnel. Instead he proposed to invite Senator Zhao Junhao, who has never participated in any receiving work.</p>
<p>One wave subsided, and another wave rose. The senators had different views on the number of participants. He Yuanming and Zhang Zhongyuan and others advocated for five people to participate. Zhang Zhongyuan also said that there must be two people from the business community, but Jiang Huaisu felt that five people were not appropriate. Since the speaker had already agreed with team leader Zhang on three people, they would have to go back and ask again if he would agree.</p>
<p>At this time, the speaker spoke: If you must have five people, you can go back and ask again. At the same time, it is not stipulated that there must be accountants, lawyers, and people from the press. Anyone can be recommended. However, I want to ask one thing first: If team leader Zhang does not agree to five people, will we not participate at all? No one could answer this question definitively. Zhang Zhongyuan said this matter is very important, and three people are not enough. Zhang Zhihan insisted that people from the industrial and commercial sectors must be included.</p>
<p>The best way is to vote. As a result, sixty-seven people voted to send five representatives, and twenty-two people voted for three. But based on the number of people present, 130, sixty-seven votes did not pass half. Lu Shidao mentioned the organizational regulations and turned to the Shanghai Municipal Council Organizational Regulations, which clearly stipulate in Article 12: "The Municipal Council shall not open a meeting without the attendance of more than half of all senators, and no resolution shall be reached without the agreement of more than half of the senators present. If the number of votes for and against are the same, the chairman shall decide." This means that sixty-seven votes cannot decide.</p>
<p>Imperceptibly, the number of people at this meeting needed to be accurately counted. The secretariat staff became nervous and found that there were only 117 senators present. It turned out that 19 people had left midway. "Left midway"! Zhang Zhihan cleverly pointed out: "Article 6 of the draft rules of procedure specifies that leaving the meeting should be reported to the chairman, and the number of people who left should not be removed." The speaker also smiled and could only say, "Some people have asked me for leave, and some have not. Now people are gone, and there is no way." In the end, the supporters of five people won. But who to choose? Some people suggested that the speaker nominate the candidates to save trouble. But the speaker's opinion was: "There is not enough time today. It has been decided to issue ballots for election tomorrow." Before he finished speaking, all the senators applauded unanimously, representing a verbal "agreement."</p>
<h3>Six Peking Opera Theaters Prepare for a Charity Performance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association has been established for more than two months. Various entertainment circles in the city have held a charity performance for the refugees in Northern Jiangsu. Now, six Peking Opera theaters, including Huangjin, Tianchan, Queen, Grand Stage, Gong Stage, and China, also plan to hold a charity performance each, or plan to jointly rehearse a charity opera by famous actors from various theaters for two days. The association has appointed a special commissioner to launch this activity, and the date will be set soon.</p>
<h3>US Soldier Steals Film · Russian Receives Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The commander of the US Naval Port requested the police bureau to arrest the suspects because the headquarters of Yangshupu had been repeatedly stolen of sixteen films and three film projectors. After investigation by Wang Chen, chief of the foreign affairs section, the case has been solved. The three main culprits are soldiers named Howard, Johnass, and Eddie. After interrogation, they confessed to the theft. The stolen goods had been sold to Holange, a 48-year-old Russian barber living at 921 Linsen Road, and Gudali, an engineer living at Room 104, 490 Albert Road, for a total of US$300 and US$500. The sales took place in front of the Bund Water Front Hotel. The three US soldiers have been handed over to the US military police for questioning. The two Russians will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today on charges of receiving stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Ticket Seller Arrested for Wounding a Police Officer · British No. 12 Trolley Workers Go on Strike</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Trolley No. 350, which runs from Jing'an Temple to Zhongshan Garden on Yuyuan Road, was driving near Zhongshan Garden at about 8 pm last night. The passengers were extremely crowded, and they were scrambling to board the car. Three inspectors from the Changning Road Sub-bureau, Zhang Desen, Wang Jigang, and Liu Qiyun, were all in plain clothes and also boarded the car with the crowd. Zhang and Wang got on first, and when Liu Qiyun was about to step onto the car, the driver Teng Lisheng (No. 960) closed the iron door. Inspector Zhang told him that there was still one person and asked him to open it. Unexpectedly, the ticket seller Wang Guohua (No. 1185) opened and closed the door, crushing Liu's ankle, which caused a verbal dispute. The ticket seller Wang Guohua used the iron pliers for punching tickets to stab Liu's left eyebrow, piercing two holes. Zhang Desen was also stabbed in the arm by him with the iron pliers, taking off a piece of flesh. The three inspectors took the driver Teng Lisheng and the ticket seller Wang Guohua to the bureau for questioning. Afterwards, other No. 12 trolley workers went on strike upon hearing the news.</p>
<h3>German Spy Suspect Detained in Prison · Trial Opens in Defamation Case Against US Reporter</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The United Press International (UPI) once published the war crimes committed by 22 German citizens and other Nazis in China, including Shen Ke. Shen Ke, who is being tried in a US military court for espionage, is currently detained in a Shanghai prison. This person recently filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai District Court, accusing Randall, the director of UPI's China branch, of intentional defamation. The District Court held a hearing at 4 pm yesterday. Yao, the attorney representing Shen, told Judge Wang Jiazhu that Randall had defamed his client's reputation by issuing a special article to Shanghai and foreign newspapers through UPI on April 16, which was published in the Shanghai China Press. Shen and Xin newspapers also carried this news. It stated that Shen Ke was sent to Chongqing by the secret activities of the Nazi Supreme Command to spy on the activities of underground workers in Chongqing in coastal cities, as well as the routes by which Americans and other United Nations personnel infiltrated free China. Attorney Yao claimed that his client could not only refute these accusations, but also prove that the news released by the defendant was groundless. He believes that Randall violated Articles 310, paragraph 1 and 2 of the Chinese Criminal Law. (Note: Articles 310, paragraph 1 and 2 stipulate a sentence of imprisonment of not less than two years, or a fine of not more than 1,000 legal tender.) Attorney Yao then presented a document, which he claimed was written by Chen Jie, the former Chinese ambassador to Germany and the current ambassador to Latin America, which recognized Shen Ke as a friend of China. He also said that he could present written or oral evidence from Jiang Bocheng and Wu Shaoshu, the leaders of the Chinese underground workers in the Shanghai area during the Japanese occupation, stating that Jiang and Wu had met with Shen Ke and discussed the situation at the time. At this point, Randall defended himself, saying that it was an insult to the court and himself that a national of a country that was hostile to both China and the United States dared to file a lawsuit in prison because an American reporter reported the official announcement of a US Army investigator. Randall presented an announcement issued by the US Army Memorial Department on April 15, which stated that Shen Ke ostensibly disguised himself as an anti-Hitler and pro-China journalist, but in fact he was a well-trained secret agent of the German Supreme Command. He exchanged information about the Japanese with some Chinese people for information about the distribution of Chinese troops. The fierce bombing of Chongqing was closely related to the reports provided to the Japanese by these Germans who were "loyal to both sides." Randall also presented another piece of evidence, a document issued by the Public Relations Group of the US Army Command in China, which pointed out that between May 8 and August 15, 1945, Shen Ke spied in Shanghai on US and Allied military operations and reported to the Japanese army. Randall asked the court to dismiss the case, but Judge Wang Jiazhu did not allow it and announced that the trial would be adjourned to September 23. Randall pointed out that the US military court will open the trial of Nazi secret activists next Monday, and he believes that Shen Ke may not be able to appear in court on September 23.</p>

<h3>News from the Meeting</h3>
<p>Zhong Yuliang, the district head of District 31, was the most eye-catching and amusing figure in the council. This gentleman was bald, sported a Japanese-style mustache, wore a Hong Kong shirt and shorts, and his voice was so loud it could truly be described as "earth-shattering." Moreover, he was full of expression and gestures, looking left and right while speaking, sometimes tense, sometimes grinning. One moment he was shouting, the next he was whispering. It would be hard to find many people in the audience who didn't laugh. His speech was also extremely humorous. He said that there were so many engineers, yet they couldn't even fix a ferry. Weren't there many different titles for engineers, such as chief engineer, deputy engineer, assistant engineer, trainee engineer, engineer with a hat, engineer without a hat, and so on?</p>
<p>Ma Shaoquan said that he had good intentions to help solve the housing shortage and invested a lot of capital, preparing to build houses, but the Public Works Bureau delayed issuing a permit for six weeks. He asked the Public Utilities Bureau to connect tap water to the factory, but there was still no news after two months. Ma repeatedly said, "I'm unlucky." He said there were probably two reasons for the Bureau's delay: (1) it was intentional, in which case "national currency must pave the way," (2) there were not enough technical personnel.</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau was very attentive and meticulous in distributing documents to the councilors. The most valuable of these was a copy of the latest Shanghai City Map for each person. This map was still rare in post-war Shanghai, measuring seven feet one inch in height and five feet in width. When opened, it resembled a large bedsheet.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Yiyuan venue, the electric fan on the right side malfunctioned, making it unbearably hot. Those seated on the right side all held various paper fans and waved them incessantly.</p>
<p>Over the five days of the meeting, Lu Huimin was the first female councilor to speak on the podium. Ms. Lu is a lawyer, so it's no wonder her speech was clear, organized, and composed.</p>
<p>When Councilor Zhai asked Zhao Zengjue, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to explain why the telephone bill was initially set at 100 yuan per call and then increased by 200 yuan, Zhao repeatedly said, "Good, good, good, good, good!"</p>
<p>Zhao Yangxiong, the first person from the Public Works Bureau questioned yesterday morning, spoke fluent Mandarin. The second person, Jin Hongxiang, spoke standard Pudong dialect. Both were equally pleasing to the ear. One was fat, and the other was thin, creating a contrasting and amusing sight. Both received applause from the entire audience after their speeches.</p>

<h3>Xie Guansheng Discusses the Postponement of the Amnesty Case, the Reported Case of He Dehui Has Not Reached the Stage for Announcement, and the Transfer of Convicted Traitors from Various Places to Shanghai Facilitates Management, Expressing Satisfaction with Recent Inspections</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, when a reporter inquired with Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng about the case of He Dehui being reported as a suspected traitor, he replied that the Shanghai Municipal Government had solid evidence that the Ministry of Judicial Administration had conducted a detailed investigation of the case. However, he was not at liberty to say whether the case would be announced soon. He also stated that his trip had nothing to do with the He case. He had intended to come to Shanghai in March, but it had been delayed until now due to a lack of time because of official duties. Regarding the amnesty, Minister Xie stated that the Legislative Yuan had passed it, but it was currently postponed. The Ministry of Judicial Administration was awaiting orders and would proceed accordingly once received.</p>
<p>The reporter also asked Minister Xie for clarification on the phrase "one portion of the family's necessary living expenses must be retained" from the confiscated property of traitors. According to him, this was not a numerical issue, but rather a matter of circumstances. The court would consider the local social conditions and the number of family members of the offender when handling the matter.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of transferring convicted traitors from Nanjing, Suzhou, and other places to Shanghai prisons for execution, Minister Xie stated that it was because Shanghai prisons were better equipped than those in other counties, making them easier to manage. The Ministry of Judicial Administration had already issued orders, and it would be implemented in the near future.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng, accompanied by Chief Advisor Chen Gumin and Advisor Ni Zhenyu of the ministry, continued to inspect the High Procuratorate on West Aixiangs Road, the District Procuratorate on Xuehuali Road, and the detention center of the District Court on Masinan Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. President of the District Court Cha Liangjian, Chief Prosecutor of the District Procuratorate Huang Liang, Chief Clerk Quan Tao, Chief Prosecutor of the High Procuratorate Du Baoqi, Warden of the Detention Center Tian Lixun, and Acting Warden Wang Mingxian accompanied him. Minister Xie inquired in detail about the recent work of each department, paying particular attention to the health and hygiene of the detainees. He left at 12:00 PM. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, he went to inspect the Shanghai Prison at Tilanqiao, accompanied by President of the High Court Guo Yunguan and Warden Xu Chongwen, touring the Zhong Jian (Loyalty Section), hospital, workshops, and women's prison. Later, he went to the First Criminal Division of the High Court, where Judge Cao Jun was hearing the case of Jiang Weicheng, suspected of being a traitor. After the Chief Prosecutor of the High Procuratorate, Du Baoqi, welcomed him to the temporary office, he rested briefly before leaving at 4:45 PM.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the reporter asked Minister Xie about his impressions of inspecting the various judicial organs in Shanghai over the past two days, he replied that the prison facilities were very good, especially the old ones, and only needed to be further supplemented. He also said that the management and personnel aspects were still fairly satisfactory.</p>
<p>Minister Xie will inspect the military court and the Japanese war criminal detention center at 10:00 AM today. He will leave Shanghai tomorrow and travel to Suzhou to inspect the local legal organs. He will return to Shanghai on Monday and then go to Hangzhou.</p>

<h3>The High Court Sentences Two Traitors; the Sentences for Pan Sansheng and Four Others Are Scheduled; the Hearings for Xu Jianping and Jiang Weicheng Are Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The High Court yesterday announced the verdicts in two traitor cases: Zhou Wenrui, a Taiwanese national who was the Director of the Finance Bureau of the puppet Shanghai Avenue Municipal Government, was sentenced to ten years in prison. Wang Weicai, a puppet Baozhang (neighborhood head), was sentenced to one year and six months in prison.</p>
<p>Pan Sansheng, who organized the puppet Gold Industry United Exchange Association, puppet United Exchange Bank, Shanghai Steamship Company, Asian General Association, Chinese General Association, Zhaogeng Club, puppet Football Federation, and other organizations during the enemy-puppet period, concluded his debate in the collegiate court of the High Court yesterday morning, and the sentence is scheduled to be announced at 9:00 AM on the 19th of this month.

The traitor suspect case of Bai Xiaolan is also scheduled to be sentenced on the same day.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the court investigated several cases, including Xu Jianping, the General Manager of the puppet Central Trust Company; Jiang Weicheng, the Director of the puppet Nantong Direct Tax Bureau; Feng Guanfu, the foreman of the enemy's Public Grand Yarn Factory; Dao Ci, a White Russian intelligence agent of the puppet Special Service Headquarters; and the cases of Jiang Dawei and Wang Shuzhu. The defendants were questioned, and witnesses were summoned, and the hearings were postponed.</p>
<h3>The District Court is Moving to the Former French Barracks; Negotiations with the French Side Are Underway</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai District Court currently shares an office with the High Court on North Zhejiang Road. Due to the limited space, which is insufficient, a request was previously made to the Executive Yuan to designate the Huangpu Police Branch Building as the new site for the District Court. However, due to many difficulties, this was not realized. Now, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has designated the former French barracks on Fuli Road as the new site for the District Court and the District Procuratorate. The current site on North Zhejiang Road will be used exclusively by the High Court and the High Procuratorate.

<h3>The Manager of Yutong Salt Manufacturing Company Embezzles Funds; Accepts Over 20 Million Yuan in Payment for Goods and Uses it Privately for Lending and Purchasing Houses; He Will Be Handed Over to the District Procuratorate for Questioning Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Li Xiaozhong, a retired Lieutenant General of the Army, 58 years old, from Shandong Province, residing at No. 356 Wusong Road, was introduced by a friend in March of this year to order 2,000 dan of edible salt from Yutong Salt Manufacturing Company at No. 2, Lane 335, Yanping Road. The price of the salt, including freight, tariffs, and miscellaneous items, totaled 25.8 million yuan. After both parties signed the contract, Li paid the full amount to Wu Gengxin (also known as Zhi Mei, 52 years old, from Anhui Province), the manager of the company. Wu, seeing the money, had ulterior motives and privately deposited the money in the bank to earn interest and purchased a building at No. 24 Zhianfang, North Sichuan Road. He claimed that he had sent employee Zhou Dihua to the salt-producing areas of Xuzhou and Haizhou to purchase the salt in batches. When the contract expired, he forged letters and telegrams, saying that the situation in the area was unstable, causing the shipment to be delayed. Later, due to the long delay, he forged another letter, claiming that the salt had been shipped to Hankou and instructed Li to send someone to escort it to Shanghai. When Li sent someone to Hankou, he suddenly claimed that it was still in Xuzhou. After such back and forth, it all turned out to be false. Li, unable to bear it any longer, seriously negotiated with Wu, who still made excuses to request an extension and returned a deposit slip from the Tongrun Qianzhuang for 4.8 million yuan. Afterwards, he avoided meeting Li. At this point, Li knew he had been deceived and reported the information to the police, who sent investigator Zhang Changgui to No. 24 Zhianfang, North Sichuan Road, to arrest Wu. They confiscated bank deposit checks, anti-counterfeiting letters, seals, and other items. However, Wu's statement to the police still insisted that he had indeed sent an employee with 16 million yuan to Xuzhou and Haizhou to purchase salt, but the employee had fled to the Communist area, resulting in the inability to deliver the goods on time. After the police showed him the original copies of the forged letters and seals, he was speechless and admitted to the fraud. As for the defrauded funds, in addition to 4 million yuan spent on purchasing the house, 3.1 million yuan was lent out, 1.3 million yuan was lent out in the Yangzhou countryside, 600,000 yuan was deposited in the Continental Bank, and the rest of the money had been spent. However, after investigation by the police, it was discovered that 2 million yuan had been borrowed from Li Xinwu at No. 3 Songyun Villa, Shanyin Road. The case has now been investigated and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for interrogation today.</p>

<h3>The "Private Prostitute Concentration Camp" Presents a Wonderful Performance at the Laozha Branch; A Hero Saves a "Beauty" in a Scene on the Stealing Chicken Bridge</h3>
<p>[Our Special Feature] The "Pickpocketing Brigade" is scheduled to have a grand parade this morning, but yesterday, the Laozha Branch unexpectedly had a wonderful performance of a "Private Prostitute Concentration Camp!"</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the area around the New World on Xizang Road has the most private prostitutes in Shanghai. Before the sun even sets, it is filled with countless demons and monsters mixed with powder and rouge, becoming one of the wonders of this largest international city in the Far East. These areas are under the jurisdiction of the Laozha Branch. Shi Sijian, the head of the branch, finally made the determination to take action and clear them out. 111 unlicensed private prostitutes were seized in July, and the number suddenly increased to 280 in August. From September 1st to 12th, another 81 were seized, bringing the total to around 500, while the total number of registered prostitutes in the city is only 965.</p>
<p>Police Officer Du Huiting, No. 3225, was ordered by Branch Head Shi to specialize in the task of clearing out "ladies of the night." On the night of September 12th, he went to Stealing Chicken Bridge on Zhifu Road in plain clothes, bringing three plainclothes officers with him. They caught four "wild chickens." Just as they were preparing to take the "chickens" back to the station, a jeep suddenly sped over, and four strong men in air force uniforms jumped out and helped them by drawing their knives to prevent them from catching "chickens" at Stealing Chicken Bridge. They tried to drag Du Huiting onto the jeep, and Du Huiting's three officers stepped forward to resist. The situation became tense, and a major battle was about to break out. Du Huiting blew his whistle, and police officers swarmed the area. The jeep quickly made a strategic retreat, and two of the four strong men failed to escape. One was named Mao Yutian, and the other's name is unknown; he can be said to be an "unsung hero." This matter may just be a misunderstanding, but why would a hero need to righteously save "beauty" when the police are "catching chickens?" After investigation, it turned out that one of the four arrested "beauties" was a confidante of one of the four "heroes"—let's hope that after this little comedy, the "heroes and beauties" will finally be reunited. Since he is a warm-hearted man, how can he bear to let the woman he loves live a life of "eating wind and dew?"</p>
<p>Yesterday, Branch Head Shi summoned forty or fifty old and young private prostitutes who were detained at the Laozha Branch and earnestly advised them not to engage in this most bitter profession in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, who in the world would willingly live such a life!</p>

<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Shipping Industry; Report on Improving Water Transport Methods for the Military; The Content of the Discussion Resolved to Urge the General Administration to Disclose Materials Awaiting Transport</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 3:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the Bank of Communications on Hankou Road, Bund, to discuss various important issues facing the shipping industry. All directors and supervisors, including Qian Yongming and Lin Xisheng, attended. Chairman Yang Guanbei first invited Secretary-General Li Yunliang to report on the joint meeting with Hu Shiyuan, Deputy General Manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Liu Yaohan, Director of the Shanghai Water Military Transport Office, who went to Beijing to negotiate with Xi Enshui, Director of the Transportation Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, to improve water transport methods for the military and adjust the difference in fees. It was stated that most of the outline of the Shanghai shipping industry's proposed measures to improve water transport methods for the military had been adopted by the government. In the future, the rental of ships for military transport will be in accordance with ordinary ship rental methods, with contracts established in advance. All ships designated by the government to perform special tasks, such as ships specifically transporting relief supplies, scheduled ships operating on fixed routes to maintain traffic, will be rented. Military supplies and scattered troops will be transported using consignment methods. Military supplies will be charged at 80% of the commercial freight rate, and soldiers will be charged at 60% of ordinary ticket prices. Regarding the difference in rent, it was also agreed that the rate for the Sichuan River would be increased to 12 times the base rate, that is, three times the price, and the rate for other routes would be increased to eight times the base rate, that is, twice the original price. In order to ensure the proper dispatch of rented and consigned ships, the Joint Logistics Department decided to establish a water transport liaison group, with one representative each from the Shanghai Water Military Transport Office, the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to maintain regular contact. In addition to the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company having appointed Lin Huanting as its representative, the association also appointed Jiang Weiquan, the head of the association's business group, to participate in the liaison group. The group's office is located at No. 97 Hankou Road and can begin work immediately. Next, concrete measures for various shipping companies to assist in operating all the ships of the General Administration to facilitate the transportation of relief supplies were discussed. It was decided to gather the strength of state-run and private companies to act as agents for all ships of the General Administration and to do their best.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Shipping Industry Association made a solemn resolution yesterday to urge the General Administration's Storage and Transportation Department to disclose the quantity and destination of relief supplies stored in Shanghai awaiting transport, in order to be responsible for allocating and loading them for shipment. The shallow water season on the Yangtze River will begin soon. The industry hopes to take advantage of all available ship tonnage to complete the transport before the shallow water season, with a monthly transport volume of at least 100,000 tons. It is also reported that there are only 20,000 tons of materials stored in Shanghai awaiting transport to Hankou, and the ships that have sailed to Hankou in the past few days, including Hongda, Dada, Jiangning, and Luxing, will be able to clear them out. There is absolutely no problem with the transportation of relief supplies.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Inland River Shipping Needs to be Rectified; Freight Rates Are Not Unified, Schedules Are Irregular, Passengers Are Few, and Equipment on Each Vessel is Deteriorating</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) This reporter recently met with Mr. Wang Jianping of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company and asked him about the organization of inland river ships and the current situation after the victory. He replied one by one, saying that there were 31 companies before the war, with 84 small boats, totaling 260 tons, and 358 tugboats, approximately 7,800 tons, operating on 15 routes. The industry suffered greatly during the war, and the old companies were unable to operate.</p>
<p>After the victory, the association reorganized them. Currently, there are 19 companies: Yuantong Shipping Bureau, Tongren Shipping Company, Shanghai Yuanhong Shipping Bureau, Dali Joint Venture Company affiliated Pinghu Shipping Bureau, Shanghai Qingji Shipping Bureau, Minnan Xieji Inland River Shipping Company, Songhu Shipping Company, Faji Shipping Bureau, Dajiangnan Transportation Bureau, Gongmao Shipping Bureau, Huada Enterprise Joint Venture Company, Shanghai Xingchang Shipping Bureau, Lixing Xinji Shipping Bureau, Lixing Yingji Shipping Bureau, Ning Shaoshengsheng Transportation Bureau, Zhengchang Hangji Shipping Bureau, Xingji Chang Transportation Company, Heji Transportation Bureau, and Xiexing Inland River Shipping Company. This is a decrease of four-tenths compared to before the war. Among them, only Yuan!. Yuanshi, Faji, Lixing, Gongmao and other five are old companies. All of their ships were lost, so they were unable to resume operations for a time. The ships of the new companies were even more numerous than before the war, approximately eight-tenths, totaling more than 140, but most of the equipment was incomplete. In particular, the ships with engines converted from automobile engines and those fueled by "command oil" are even more dangerous. Firefighting equipment is mostly lacking. The authorities do not pay attention, and the association cannot rectify them. There are currently only seven routes: Shenxi Chang, Shenhu (Huzhou), Shenping (Pinghu), Shenyu (Changshu), Shensha (Shaxi), Shenhang (Hangzhou), and Shensu (Suzhou), a decrease of eight routes compared to before the war. The business situation is still acceptable. The routes are not fixed and only change depending on the prosperity of the cargo transportation. For example, if there is a lot of cargo on the Shenhu route, most of the ships will operate on the Shenhu route. If there is a lot of cargo on the Shensu route, everyone will operate on the Shensu route. There are no unified freight rates either. They increase or decrease freely depending on the amount of cargo. Compared to ordinary freight rates, it is indeed cheaper, at 10,000 yuan per ton and only 500 yuan per dan. Passenger only seek rapid delivery to the destination, even if it costs 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per item, they are willing to pay, so there is only increase in freight rates, definitely no decrease. As for passenger ticket prices, it is said that there are few passengers because highways and railways are convenient, time can be shortened, and costs are more economical. Unless they have bulky luggage that is inconvenient to carry by highway or railway, they will never change to small boats. Before the war, the companies competed for business, reducing ticket prices again and again. The poor sought cheapness, regardless of time, and rode small boats. Now, the situation is the opposite of what it was before the war, so there are no passengers at all. The companies also do not pay attention to passenger seats. The equipment on each boat has gradually deteriorated. When asked how things could be put back on track in the future, Mr. Wang shook his head and said that there was little hope. Now, the only hope is that the authorities must use strict legal means to rectify the situation according to the law. There is still hope for the future. He then bid farewell and left.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Line Ship Schedule Confirmed</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Since the resumption of services on the Yangtze River, North and South Ocean lines, shipping schedules have been disrupted by military and government transport demands. This has caused inconvenience for commercial transport and passengers. According to those familiar with shipping operations, various companies are keen to establish fixed schedules, but due to the demands of official duties, it is feared that fixed schedules will be difficult to implement in the short term. However, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line (i.e., Shanghai to Ningbo) schedule can now be confirmed. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangya" ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Ningbo every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

<h3>Basketball Game: Air Force Performance Greatly Improved, War and Shan Team Tie - 51 Points Each in the First Half</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Nanjing Air Force basketball team played its third visiting game in Shanghai last night, facing off against the Shan team at 8:00 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium. The Air Force team has improved rapidly. As a result of last night's fierce battle, they ultimately drew, with 20 points each in the first half and a total of 51 points each. After discussions, both sides shook hands and made peace.</p>
<p>Key Player Absent</p>
<p>The Shan team was still able to display its inherent style in yesterday's game, performing quickly, but due to the absence of Ma Jiexi, there was no one to direct, which meant that it could not be fast and stable, and it was less impressive. This is why they failed to win. The shooting of newcomer Liu Jingxing was easy to watch. Chen Qingjiang and Lin Weicong's shots were not smooth, which was also abnormal.</p>
<p>Visiting Team Gets Points</p>
<p>In this game, the Air Force was able to successfully utilize the man-to-man marking tactic, and use obstruction methods to penetrate deep into the paint, which was especially valuable. In defense and offense, they were on top of the game, and Qin Xunze and Liu Zhenyuan were agile and had satisfactory performances.</p>
<p>A Close Match</p>
<p>The two teams took the court on time. The Shan team started with He Lide, Chen Qingjiang, Liu Jingxing, Cai Yanxiong, and Ji Nankang. The visiting team had Qin Xunze, Liu Zhenyuan, Ge Kezhifeng, Wang Helin, and Li Xianyue as guards. After the start, the Shan team took the lead with a score of 5 to 1. The visiting team took a timeout and chased back to 5 points each. The situation remained tense, and the score was tied for a long time. The first half ended with 20 points each. In the second half, the Shan team took the lead again. The visiting team worked hard to catch up, and the score was always one or two points apart. When the score was 33 to 29, Cai Yanxiong of the Shan team was injured and left the court, which had an impact. After that, both sides committed many fouls. Until the end of the game, the score was 51 points each. Both sides agreed not to extend the game.</p>

<h3>Yarn Allocation Fully Distributed According to Quota, But Spinning and Weaving Factory's Listing Remains Unchanged, Yarn Stores Still Lament Being Left Out, Actual Sales Activity Stops Price Decline and Causes Rebound, Factories Actively Rectify Selling of Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) Yesterday, the yarn market turned around. The Hunan and Hubei merchants showed great interest, and customers from the mainland of Beijing and Anhui also purchased enthusiastically. Therefore, prices stopped falling and rebounded. 20-count yarn rose by about 10,000 to 20,000. In the market, the "Golden Rooster" brand of 420-pound special yarn was transacted at 2.55 million, comparable to the price of the "Special Double Horse" brand. However, the 400-pound standard yarn approved and sold by the Joint Allocation Committee, such as the "Golden Rooster" brand in stock, although quoted at 1.36-1.37 million, lacked buyers, showing the general unpopularity of lightweight goods. 41-count yarn was purchased by a cloth factory yesterday, approaching the 2.3 million mark again, an increase of about 50,000 compared to the previous day. At 10:00 AM, the Spinning and Weaving Factory listed prices as usual, maintaining the levels before the foreign exchange adjustment. However, only factories were allocated, and yarn stores were not allowed to participate at all. At 11:00 AM, the Spinning and Weaving Factory opened sales of ten-day futures. Everything was in accordance with the joint allocation method. Yesterday, the company opened sales of 23 types, including "Blue Phoenix" and other brands. 42-count "Bao Guang" was priced at 1.89 million, and 20-count "Blue Phoenix" was priced at 1.6 million, mostly allocated to dyeing and weaving factories. 32-count "Five Color Star" and other brands were allocated to other cotton manufacturing industries, priced 30,000 lower than the previous period. Yarn stores have not received any allocation for three weeks, causing considerable anxiety. The yarn industry association is actively rectifying the market while appealing for allocations. However, no allocation was made yesterday, which yarn industry insiders deeply regretted, hoping that the Spinning and Weaving Factory can improve the situation in future yarn allocations. As for the practical factories, they are also closely monitoring and actively rectifying the selling of warehouse receipts by a few manufacturers.</p>
<p>The Yarn Factory Joint Allocation Committee held a regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. It was decided on the spot to open sales of 5.645 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn (of which the Spinning and Weaving Factory accounted for 2,263 pieces), with full allocation according to the application amount. The selling price will be based on 1.3 million per piece of 400-pound 20-count "Double Horse" yarn. The next opening date was set for the 16th.</p>
<p>The cloth market was flat. "Dragon Head" fine cloth, due to the Spinning and Weaving Factory not opening sales for four or five times, was still quoted at 67,000 yuan. Serge, having not opened sales for three times, was quoted at 63,500 yuan, without much change. The "Blue V" brand was once quoted at an additional 7,000 yuan, but eventually fell to 6,000 yuan. Unbranded fine cloth was mostly sold at the original Spinning and Weaving Factory price. This type of fine cloth, compared to the "Eagle Camel" brand from Changzhou and the "Tianma" brand from Shanghai, is of slightly firmer quality and is very popular with dyeing factories. General merchants do not need much, so there are few applicants.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Slightly Decreases, US Dollar Slightly Increases</h3>
<p>Smelted gold was mediocre yesterday. It opened at 2.155 million in the morning. The Central Bank slightly supplied, then immediately announced the lower price. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 72 bars, priced at 2.1425 million. After 10:00 AM, it was even more peaceful. At noon, it fell again below 2.14 million, and trading was limited. The market was quiet. In the afternoon, it first fell to 2.133 million, then rebounded to around 2.145 million. As a result, it closed down slightly by about 20,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold slightly decreased to 22,700. Silver ingots were flat, while silver dollars slightly increased. The underground money market was balanced, with interest rates around 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were also mediocre. The US dollar opened at 3,380 yuan and was sold, but trading was also limited. There was little change in the process. At noon, it began to weaken to 3,350 yuan. In the afternoon, it first fell to 3,340 yuan, and finally rose slightly to 3,380 yuan due to the influence of arbitrage buying. As a result, it closed up slightly by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The exchange rate against gold was slightly reduced to 6,353 per ten taels. The Hong Kong dollar was affected by the contraction of the Hong Kong Shenbao and rose by 10 yuan, as did the Hong Kong exchange rate, from 695 yuan to 705 yuan. Indian exchange rate was from 840 yuan to 850 yuan, and the British exchange rate was offered at 11,400 yuan, with the US exchange rate hovering around the listed price.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Turn from Steady to Weak</h3>
<p>Except for a few unpopular small stocks that occasionally surged, the remaining Chinese stocks generally felt weak and retreated slightly. Each stock turned from steady to weak. Hot stocks slightly rebounded mid-session, but were still slightly soft near noon. Trading was quiet, with large investors watching. As a result, Yong Yarn, American Asiatic, Jingfu, New Light, and Qinxing continued to decline slightly compared to the previous close. Medium-sized stocks among the less popular stocks declined significantly. Among the small stocks, except for China-France and New Asia, which made slight progress, the remaining stocks also declined slightly, and the veteran Yin had no strength to advance.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks stopped falling and rose slightly yesterday. Each stock had scattered buyers, showing a stable situation. Trading was not yet smooth. As a result, Asiatic Petroleum and Jardine Matheson were flat compared to the previous close, and the remaining stocks slightly rebounded.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Trading is Not Smooth</h3>
<p>The public bond market continued to hover, with people's attitudes undecided, and trading was not smooth. The unified bond opened at 2,300 yuan in the morning, rising to a high of 2,450 yuan, but soon fell back to 2,210 yuan, and finally hovered around 2,250 yuan. As a result, it closed up slightly by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Types A and B also rose by 50 yuan, the unified Ding was flat, and the unified E fell by 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Construction Red Tea Is Vigorously Bought</h3>
<p>The red and green tea varieties are still being sold continuously in the shops and banks of this street and in the Suzhou and Wuxi area. Export companies are also showing increasing interest. Because the sailing date of this month's 20th has been changed to the 23rd, it is said, each company is rushing to make up for the insufficient amount, especially Fujian black tea, which is most vigorously bought, with each dan rising by more than 2,000 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Falls Sharply and Then Recovers Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, due to continuous price drops, had already hit the company's allocated price, so it showed a sign of sharp decline followed by a slight recovery. The association set the price of medium-grade white sugar on the morning of the 20th at 143,000 yuan, then rose by 3,500 yuan, then 4,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, 6,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it even rose to 7,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were 142,000 yuan, raw sugar 112,000, 4,000 yuan, 6,000 yuan, an increase of 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Four-and-a-half-vehicle white sugar was 200,000 yuan, three-and-a-half-vehicle white sugar was 180,000 yuan, refined green was quoted at 125,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan, cotton red was 133,000 yuan, with a slight amount of transactions.</p>
<h3>Spring and Quanzhou Longan Try New Markets</h3>
<p>The new crop of Quanzhou big-bubble dried longan is harvesting very well this year, so the prices are high. The calculations show that the profit margins are not adequate. Therefore, a small amount has been shipped to Shanghai to test the market and will soon be available.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Shipped to America</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Finklecliffe, managed by Shun Heng Foreign Company, set sail for America this morning, carrying 274 boxes of tung oil, 219 boxes of tea, 191 boxes of wool, and more than 180 pieces of pig bristles.</p>
<h3>Waterproof Cloth Decline</h3>
<p>The woolen textile market maintains stable prices, and transactions are still quite active. However, the prices of all brands of waterproof cloth are declining. First-class is quoted at only 5,000 yuan per yard, second-class at 4,700 yuan, and third-class at 4,000 yuan. The quantity needed by buyers has decreased because the peak sales season has gradually passed, and it has also been affected by the low price of glass raincoats. Furthermore, formally produced waterproof cloth of various types can now be ordered. These three factors have created the current situation of abundant goods in the market.</p>
<h3>Allocation Is Insufficient to Meet Factory Needs, Rayon Jumps Greatly Again Yesterday, Italian Silk Will Be Unloaded Within Days</h3>
<p>Rayon, which had been weak for several days, rebounded yesterday. 120 Tianqiao bright rayon was first traded at 6.24 million in the morning and, in the blink of an eye, rose to 6.8 million at closing. The afternoon was even better, with transactions at 7.2 million and sellers quoting 7.5 million, a sharp increase of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous afternoon. Various brands of miscellaneous rayon were also driven up by 130,000 to 140,000 yuan. This is because China Textile has expressed its determination to stop allocating goods to rayon stores, and the goods allocated to silk factories do not match their sales needs and are very small in quantity. Therefore, they still have to buy from the black market, leading to a situation where the black market first declines and then rises. Rayon stores have booked an Italian rayon that has already arrived in port and is said to be declared for customs and taxed today, with each case requiring about 700,000 yuan in taxes. The goods can be unloaded in two or three days, and the market price may be slightly reduced at that time. However, the stock of 120 bright rayon is dwindling daily, with only about 200 cases on order, including some dull rayon, so it will be difficult to suppress the price in the short term. However, the silk goods market is afraid that the difference between raw materials is too great. Manufacturers in this environment have a feeling of both laughter and tears.</p>
<h3>Spinning and Weaving Factory Requests Termination</h3>
<p>The Enemy Property Administration entrusted the China Textile Construction Corporation to sell enemy property rayon, and more than 3,000 cases have been sold. Only a few cases remain, and the inventory counting and sales procedures are troublesome. Moreover, this work is very labor-intensive. The company not only makes no profit but also has to subsidize expenses every month. According to Jiang Dixian, the deputy director of the business department of the company, the work of selling rayon has been requested to be terminated to the Enemy Property Administration, hoping to change the sales method.</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>The monthly demand for rayon in various silk factories in this city is 2,000 cases. Although the Spinning and Weaving Factory has allocations, the number is small. Therefore, in the past week, the price of rayon has soared. The China Trust Bureau will ship 40,000 cases of rayon from Japan to Shanghai, and various silk factories hope that the allocation volume can be increased at that time.</p>
<h3>The Formal Auction Date of the Stock Exchange Will Be Determined by Today's Board of Directors, The Alternative Method of Guarantee Deposit Has Been Approved</h3>
<p>The Stock Exchange continued to practice trading yesterday morning; in the afternoon, it practiced the reconciliation procedures for the entire exchange. The results were very good; each account was also reconciled accurately. However, in order to ensure that the procedures are smooth, the final exercise will be held today (the 14th). It is also rumored that the exchange is scheduled to hold the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM today (the 14th) to discuss important matters. The opening date of the auction will also be decided by this meeting.</p>
<p>The alternative method for Securities Gold substitutes, which had been submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, temporarily replaced with written guarantees from the firm, has now been approved by order. The Central Bank will designate several member banks in the Shanghai market, and brokers will contact them to provide written guarantees in lieu of substitutes to be submitted to the Central Bank. Each broker is ordered to exchange this guarantee for a substitute within one month from the opening date of the stock exchange. The exchange has contacted the Central Bank and sent letters to each broker to comply, so as to comply with the opening date decided by the Board of Directors. It is also rumored that the method of collecting the transaction tax by the exchange is still under review by the Ministry, and the exchange authorities hope to receive instructions before the scheduled opening date, so as not to affect the opening date.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Corrects Rice Measures, Uniform Implementation Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The rice measures used by the bean and rice industry in this city have been inspected for accuracy by the industry association in consultation with the Bureau of Weights and Measures, and will be implemented uniformly from the 15th. The Rice Measure Industry Workers' Union has been instructed to uniformly level the measures and not allow excessive or insufficient measurements. If there is any deliberate violation, it will be dealt with according to law. The industry association has notified each of its members to comply.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Source Is Very Strong, Japonica, Indica, and Glutinous Rice All Decline</h3>
<p>The rice market is flooded with goods and sales are slow, weak and difficult to stabilize. New japonica and indica rice both declined by a small 1,000 or 2,000 yuan. Old japonica and old indica rice are in sluggish demand and are gradually declining by 4,000 or 5,000 yuan. The total registration of customers and goods in the north and south markets reached more than 10,000 stones. Flour sales are not smooth and continue to decline by a small 300 or 400 yuan. Wheat from Fujian, Ningbo, and Qingdao is dull and has fallen by another 500 to 1,000 yuan. Broad beans have an inverted production and sales ratio, with fewer goods arriving, and raw kernels have declined by 1,000 yuan. Soybeans continue to rise. The digestion of soybean and vegetable oil in the oil market has become sluggish and has declined by 1,000 yuan. Raw oil is scarce and has slightly softened.</p>
<h3>Production, Sales, Transportation, and Sales, Different Tax Exemptions for Commercial Business Tax</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently received a letter from the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, roughly stating that since salt has been changed to free transportation, it is no different from ordinary commerce, and should be taxed or exempted according to the provisions of the Business Tax Law, according to the following conditions for each producer, transporter, and seller: (1) Producers should be exempt from business tax, (2) Transporters, if they are engaged in the transportation business and transport goods for others, should be taxed on the transportation business tax on the freight they receive. This business tax should not be added to the salt price for transfer by the transporter. If they are purchasing and transporting the goods themselves, they should still be exempt from business tax. (3) Sellers, after purchasing salt from salt warehouses or salt fields, whether they sell it locally or transport it to other areas for sale, regardless of whether they are engaged in exclusive or concurrent business, should be taxed on the total amount of business income in accordance with the Business Tax Law. This business tax should not be included in the salt price when selling salt. However, the business of peddlers carrying goods on their shoulders should still be exempt. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Salt Industry Association of this city to inform all members accordingly.</p>
<h3>White Coal Soars</h3>
<p>The coal market has no hope for the arrival of white coal screened lumps, and the coal reserves in Shanghai are decreasing. Although the asking price is frequently high, the supply is still scarce. Those in urgent need can only find and purchase at high prices. It is said that the highest transaction price is 600,000 yuan, a huge increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous price. White coal fines and bituminous coal, thanks to the appropriate allocation by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, have no price fluctuations in the market.</p>
<h3>False Reserve Deposits Will Be Returned in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that the liquidation office of the false Central Reserve Bank has sorted out the total amount of ordinary deposits of the false bank, which is about 500 million yuan in legal tender, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Finance for review, and it is expected to be returned in the near future. It is now said that although there are as many as eight liquidation offices, they have now been concentrated in Shanghai. Therefore, when returning deposits in the future, they will also be concentrated in Shanghai. Deposits in other locations will be refunded by mail.</p>
<h3>Seafood Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>The seafood market is declining like a river flowing downwards. Shrimp tails from various places continue to arrive, and customers are watching and waiting. Although the inventory of thousand-layered winter shiitake mushrooms is thin, the sales are stagnant and they are also declining. Mussels and prayer vegetables are ignored. Xiangshu wood ears continue to arrive and sell actively, and after falling, they have turned firm. Fins, sea cucumbers, and fish skins are stable, but dried seaweed and rice kernels, which are seasonal goods, are still firm. Seaweed is shipped from both Ningbo and Ou, and the actions of the Cantonese and Sichuan gangs are shifting. New South Dates are available, but due to the age of the trees, large ones are few and far between. Other goods, due to tight monetary conditions during the festive season, will probably be difficult to improve for a while.</p>
<h3>Zhongyi Securities Firm Opens</h3>

<h3>Pre-War Deposit Compensated Thousand-Fold Case, Appeal Letter of the Four Banks Savings Association</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Pre-war bank deposits, the Shanghai court ruled that the payment should be made at a thousand-fold, causing great shock in the national financial community. The Shanghai branch of the Four Banks Savings Association expressed its disapproval of the Shanghai District Court's ruling that the association should pay the depositor Chen Jilin 2,000 yuan for the deposit in 1940, according to one thousand times the amount. They have submitted detailed reasons to the High Court. The indictment letter has been delivered to the District Court yesterday afternoon for forwarding to the High Court. We specially transcribe its original text as follows:</p>
<p>For supplementing the reasons. I, the appellant, in the case of the civil judgment No. 1610 in the 35th year of the Shanghai District Court, have already declared an appeal within the statutory period. After reviewing the reasons of the original trial, it is neither constrained by the form of legal texts. It is based on the inference of imagination as the basis of the judgment, which is difficult to convince. Now, I would like to supplement the reasons as follows.</p>
<p>According to the application of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits after Restoration, there must be four essential conditions, and none can be missing. (1) Limited to before the effect of the legal act disappears after its establishment. (2) The event is not attributable to the parties. (3) It is not foreseeable by the parties. (4) Its effect is obviously unfair. The change of circumstances is a significant and common phenomenon, but the decline in currency value is an inevitable result of the war. It is not attributable to the appellant. Moreover, the appellee's deposit was made in 1940, three or four years after the outbreak of the war. The National Government had already moved to Chongqing and announced a long-term war of resistance policy. The price increase was a fact known to everyone. Then, the inevitable trend of the daily depreciation of the currency could be considered unforeseeable by the appellee. Since there is no event attributable to the appellant, and the appellee has the consequence that the rich can foresee, the prerequisite for applying this article no longer exists. Taking a step back, the legislative intent of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits after Restoration and the Interpretation No. 3018 of the Judicial Yuan is to seek the fairness of payment, not simply to pursue the price index. Therefore, it is stated "... the court should fairly weigh the increase or decrease in payment ..." In other words, the rights and interests of gain and loss are inherently opposed and should take into account the economic status and actual situation of both parties for the fair weighing of increasing or decreasing payments. In the case, the appellant has been affected by the currency system since 1940 and has repeatedly changed the total amount, from two to one to two hundred to one. Therefore, the 2,000 yuan deposited by the appellee was once forced by the environment to be exchanged for 1,000 yuan of puppet currency. According to this, and then converted into legal currency in accordance with laws and regulations, only 5 yuan remained. During the period when the enemy and puppets were entrenched, it was forbidden to forcibly use puppet currency and use legal currency, and once discovered, there was an unpredictable danger. Now, not only the appellant is required to restore the original deposit amount, but also to increase it by a thousand times for payment. That is, the appellee's deposit of 5 yuan requires a compensation of 2 million yuan, which is equivalent to increasing the appellant's debt of 400,000 times. It must be known that the application of the above regulations is not exclusively enjoyed by the creditor. Then, because of events not attributable to the appellant, the situation has changed, why should the appellant alone bear the foreseeable effect at that time. And calculated at 400,000 times, it is universally applied to all depositors. How can the appellant's financial resources bear it? Using the price index alone as a standard, favoring one party's interests, is a loss of the legislative fairness of the original intent. This is the first thing that I do not agree with.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the original trial reasoned that the appellant, after receiving savings deposits, did indeed use a portion of the deposits as working capital, and the remaining deposits were either used to purchase public bonds and other bonds as collateral or invested in real estate ... "I, the appellant, am referred to as:" Four Banks Savings Association ". According to Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Savings Bank Law, the deposit is received by the compound interest method and should be" regarded as a savings bank ". According to Article 4 of the same law, the appellant shall not engage in other businesses other than operating deposits and accepting deposit agency sales. I do not know what the original trial relied on when it claimed to have invested in real estate. Since it recognizes that the public bonds purchased by the appellant and the collateral deposited in the central government "suffered considerable losses due to the impact of the Ministry of Finance's face value repayment method", it is inferred that the appellant "has greatly increased the amount of currency in other aspects of investment", regardless of the actual situation and only seeking fairness in imagination. Cover what is called investment has no basis, and it is hasty to say that investment is only profitable and not harmful, especially it is ignorant of commercial sentiment. Moreover, the appellant is under the strict supervision of the Ministry of Finance, and its business is subject to its supervision, and its finance is subject to its inspection. How can it be allowed to engage in investment outside of the legal business? As for the use of funds, it is also aimed at lending. Recalling the time when the victory was realized last autumn, at the beginning of restoration and takeover, the unification of the currency system and the ratio of conversion and redemption have been on the rise. Therefore, debtors rushed to compete for repayment with pseudo-savings certificates. What the appellant received back was fake currency, which was regarded as one for two hundred. That is, the amount of currency has suffered a loss of two hundred times, and it is not the increase in the number of currencies as claimed by the original judgment. "This is the second thing that I do not agree with.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the original trial was not fair in law and reason. Therefore, I would like to ask the court to review and judge, and humbly approve the abandonment of the original judgment, reject the appellee's request for increased payment in the first instance, and order the burden of litigation costs for both trials, which is a matter of great convenience.</p>

<h3>"The Whisper of Angels"</h3>
<p>— Ping Qi</p>
<p>The poet Scott's impression of music is: "So sweet, so gentle, so ethereal, like the whisper of angels." Music leads us into a new realm. If this realm is described in Chinese poetry, I think Gong Zizhen's "Is it fairy, is it illusion, is it gentleness" might say some of it.</p>
<p>What world is this! After a whole day of painstakingly dodging and fending off, let's have some music.</p>
<p>It's not about escaping. It's just that the bowstring can't be taut forever, we should occasionally relax a bit. Music, it temporarily brings us closer to the distant homeland, it relives our childhood dreams.</p>
<p>We are grateful that there are still people like Toscanini in this world, whose magic wand leads us closer to the quiet streams in Beethoven's pastoral heart, the occasional lark flying by; this magic wand also leads us into Schubert's helpless melancholy; Tchaikovsky's sea-deep despair.</p>
<p>Today, we devoutly introduce Toscanini and Stokowski to our readers. They do not belong to any one country, they are the glory of all mankind!</p>

<h3>Reclusion</h3>
<p>— A Brief Overview</p>
<p>After Emperor Zhenzong of Song performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices, he found a recluse named Zhou Pu and forcibly summoned him to court. Zhou Pu vehemently denied being able to write poetry. Zhenzong asked him if anyone had written poems to see him off when he was being summoned. He said that only an old janitor had written one. The poem said, "No more indulging in wine in a disheveled state, nor should you recklessly love to write poetry. Now that you've been seized and taken to the government, this time it will be the end of your old skin!" Zhenzong laughed heartily upon hearing this and had no choice but to let him return home.</p>
<p>Being conscripted into service for reclusion has always been considered the most honorable thing, but he considered it being captured by the government and thought it would be the end of his skin. This is truly the greatest accusation against politics. The idea of reclusion probably originated in the Warring States period, stemming from Boyi and Shuqi. This is a passive resistance to politics or a doctrine of non-recognition, "The world cannot make him a subject, the lords cannot make him a friend," truly placing oneself outside the realm of politics. The theory of reclusion was largely completed in the hands of Zhuangzi.</p>
<p>This thought has had a tremendous effect on politics in our country. It gives politics only a relative effect, and the ruler only a relative authority. No matter what, one cannot do whatever one wants. Violence is certainly restricted, but violence cannot last. Under the doctrine of non-recognition, it must be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Under thousands of years of autocracy, the Chinese nation ultimately obtained a spiritual safe zone through the idea of reclusion.</p>
<p>Since the people have become masters of the country, the idea of reclusion can no longer exist, let alone the reality of reclusion, but violence can still exist. To deal with violence, according to Tao Yuanming, "The virtuous avoid their generation," meaning only the virtuous know how to escape. Ordinary people have no way to escape but to risk their lives and take the final path.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse into "Shi Tao's Paintings and Sayings" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wei</p>
<p>If one attempts to gain a glimpse into the life of a great artist in history by merely relying on the works he has left behind for inference, I believe the conclusion will not exceed an assessment along the lines of "the great are great," which is to say, it is in vain. The artwork itself is arguably the essence of the artist's life, but in terms of the development of his spirit and mind, it is merely equivalent to excretion, even dross. Although it can provide some nourishment to others, it cannot be used as primary data for studying his creative process. The discovery of truth in things often lies in obtaining clues from corresponding things, and the wider and denser the range of its connection with other things, the greater its inherent value.</p>
<p>Researchers should adopt this approach for every in-depth and extensive study of Shi Tao. The author dares not ignore the various issues related to Shi Tao and uses these relationships as a way to glimpse the magnificent and bizarre nature of Shi Tao's entire mind. I have often heard people say that Shi Tao's work originated from imitation, while others say that Shi Tao was a genius who completely opened up his own realm. These superficial views, regardless of whether they come from those who want to speak for themselves, do not even understand the simplest structure of the universe and are far from the subject of this article, so I do not intend to criticize them.</p>
<p>Shi Tao's Paintings and Sayings is not only a meticulous work for Shi Tao but can also be said to be an unparalleled masterpiece among theoretical painting treatises throughout history. It not only provides the best explanation for his own works but also lays the highest aesthetic standards for thousands of years of Eastern art.</p>
<p>An artist who highly values "veneration and acceptance" will not obliterate the benefits left by many predecessors. However, the extent of broad integration makes it difficult for us to glimpse the resources he absorbed at the time. At the same time, there is no need to adopt the attitude of saying that Shi Tao gained from so-and-so but lost from so-and-so. In the chapter on Veneration and Acceptance:</p>
<p>"It is valuable to respect and obtain its acceptance, and not to abandon oneself."</p>
<p>"Clinging to the ancient without transformation is a limitation of knowledge. Knowledge limited to similarity is not broad, so the gentleman only uses the ancient to serve the present." (Lao Tzu: Grasping the ways of the past to manage the things of the present, knowing the origins of the past is called the principle of Dao). In the chapter on Change:</p>
<p>"The supreme person has no law, not that there is no law, but having no law is the supreme law. In all things, there is principle and expediency, and with law, there must be transformation. Knowing one principle immediately changes, knowing one law immediately transforms."</p>
<p>These are all tight annotations for acceptance. Therefore, when talking about Shi Tao's acceptance, it is more appropriate to say that he is faithful to the feelings of nature than to say that he is faithful to the legacy of his predecessors. Nature is the location of the artist's pulse, just as merchants value their property. The difference is that one guards his narrow possessions (enslaved by things), while there is no such thing as possession and concealment with nature. Zhuangzi's hiding the world in the world is enough to show this open attitude. The reason is not that the artist's concern for nature is not like the merchant's concern for property, but that he himself is aware that he belongs to nature, and nature belongs to him. He can never be separated from nature, and nature can never leave him. Chapter on Mountains and Rivers:</p>
<p>"Mountains and rivers make me speak for mountains and rivers, mountains and rivers are born from me, and I am born from mountains and rivers."</p>
<p>In such a process of integration and acceptance, one can reflect on a question—"I," which is the existence of what is called individuality in art. The "I" that can be entrusted with a task has a large extension in meaning, because who in the universe is not being entrusted? Who is not being accepted? Chapter on Endowment:</p>
<p>"Viewing it from the perspective of fortune, it is to receive the task of nurturing. Viewing it from the perspective of management, it is to receive the task of life. Viewing it from the perspective of mountains and rivers, it is to receive the task of embryonic bones. Viewing it from the perspective of neighboring waves, it is to receive the task of painting transformation. Viewing it from the perspective of the vast sea, it is to receive the task of heaven and earth. Viewing it from the perspective of a small hall, it is to receive the task of a moment. Viewing it from the perspective of non-action, it is to receive the task of action. Viewing it from the perspective of a single stroke, it is to receive the task of ten thousand forms. Viewing it from the perspective of an empty wrist, it is to love the task of brush-tip freedom."</p>
<p>Ten thousand kinds of objects have unique self-expression, and ten thousand kinds of unique self-expression converge into an inseparable and integrated greater self (nature). What is the reason for this? The chapter on Endowment has several paragraphs:</p>
<p>"First, endow what is to be endowed."</p>
<p>"If it is not on this case to perform its task, then how can it travel the mountains and rivers of the world and connect the bloodlines of the world?"</p>
<p>"The ancient and the modern are not confused, and the brush and ink remain forever, because they are thoroughly imbued with this task."</p>
<p>"Task" is the root of the integration of "I" and all things, and it is also what makes "I" "I." Only by mutually endowing can the "I" of each individual be realized, and only by enriching thousands of individual "I" can the so-called Dao (the ever-changing nature) be abundant. The Book of Changes says, "The myriad things are endowed with origins," from which it can be said that "task," which is matched with righteousness and Dao, is the heavenly task.</p>
<p>How to exercise this "heavenly task"? Paintings and Sayings tells us about "nurturing and life," which Shi Tao valued very much and which is also mentioned the most in Paintings and Sayings. The reason why Shi Tao is so brilliant in the history of art and why his works are so profound and transcendent is that he understood "task" and made it Shi Tao's worldview. "Nurturing and life" nourished Shi Tao's wisdom. Chapter on Endowment:</p>
<p>"If the mountain does not entrust water, it is not enough to see its circulation. If the water does not entrust the mountain, it is not enough to see its embrace. If the task of mountains and rivers is not obvious, then there is no way for circulation and embrace. If circulation and embrace are not obvious, then there is no way for nurturing and life. If nurturing and life are managed, then circulation and embrace have a reason, and if circulation and embrace have a reason, then the task of mountains and rivers ceases."</p>
<p>"Thus, this task is truly the principle of nurturing and life, using one to govern ten thousand, and using ten thousand to govern one." Also, in the chapter on Brush and Ink, it says:</p>
<p>"The specifics of mountains, rivers, and all things have reverse and correct, oblique and askew, gathering and scattering, near and far, inside and outside, virtual and real, broken and continuous, layers, peeling, delicate, and clumsy. This is the great end of life. Therefore, the spirit of mountains, rivers, and all things resides in people, because they control this power of nurturing and life. If it is not so, how can there be embryos and bones, connections and unions, substance and use, form and body, arches and stands, squats and jumps, lurking, rushing to the sky, masculine, majestic, towering, steep, and dangerous under the brush and ink? Draw its spirit one by one and fulfill its divinity."</p>
<p>Because people (individuals) control this power of nurturing and life, in their eyes, nature is no longer lifeless stones and blocks of wood but things full of shape and state, embryo and bones, spirit and divinity.</p>
<p>At this point, we might as well close our eyes and think about it. From this realm of having embryos and bones, having spirit and divinity, when Shi Tao, who came out of it, picked up his brush and sucked ink, I ask: To what extent would Shi Tao value the methods of the ancients? Would he think about following or not following a certain family? Would he think about any "rules" or "three folds"? Regarding this point, the chapter on Change has a clear indication:</p>
<p>"It is the great law of exhausting all changes in the world, the essence of the shapes and forms of mountains and rivers, the shaping of all things in ancient and modern times, and the flow of yin and yang. Borrowing brush and ink to write about heaven and earth and all things and immersing myself in them. People today do not understand this and always say: 'So-and-so's few points can stand, and without so-and-so's landscape, it cannot be passed down for long. So-and-so's purity can establish character, and without so-and-so's ingenuity, it is only enough to please people.' This is me being used by so-and-so, not so-and-so being used by me. Even if I force myself to be like so-and-so, I am only eating so-and-so's leftovers. What is there to me? Or some say to me: 'So-and-so is broad, so-and-so is concise, which door should I enter, which level should I be, which comparison should I make, which effect should I verify, which point should I apply, which form should I use, so that I can be ancient and the ancient can be me?' Those who are like this only know that there is the ancient but do not know that there is me. My being me has its own 'I' in me. The eyebrows of the ancient cannot grow on my eyebrows. Even if I sometimes touch upon a certain family, it is that certain family approaching me, not me deliberately being like a certain family. It is naturally bestowed, and what ancient teacher do I have that I cannot transform?"</p>
<p>All rules are only there to be "obstacles." Therefore, if it is "naturally bestowed," then there is no obstacle to speak of. Without obstacles, there are no rules to speak of. Shi Tao said, "Painting comes from the heart, and obstacles are far away." Coming from the heart means following the rules without exceeding them (Confucius had the idea of following his heart's desire without exceeding the bounds), but how can these be understood by superficial and incompetent craftsmen? Therefore, Shi Tao exclaimed:</p>
<p>"The world knows there are rules but does not know the meaning of heaven's rotation and earth's turning."</p>
<p>The operation of heaven and earth follows nature, so how can there be any rules? Because there are no obstacles, all movements become compliant with the rules. This is the realm of the integration of heaven and man, "transforming without transforming, doing without doing." Furthermore, as he talks about brush and ink:</p>
<p>"The ink is used richly, and the brush is used skillfully with spirit. Ink is not spiritual without nurturing, and the brush is not divine without life." 引法章:</p>
<p>"The painter, shapes heaven and earth and all things, if one get rid of brush and ink, how shall one shape the world. The ink receives from heaven, thick and light, dry and moist, follows it, the brush is controlled by man, outlines, smears, and dyes follows it." Chapter on Change:</p>
<p>"Borrowing brush and ink to write about heaven and earth and all things and immersing myself in them."</p>
<p>"In the sea of ink, determine the spirit, under the tip of the brush, decide on life, on the foot of the ruler, change the fur and bones, in the chaos, release the light. Even if the brush is not a brush, the ink is not ink, I myself exist." (If the brush is a brush, the ink is ink, where do I reside and stand? It is in the space between the brush not being a brush and the ink not being ink that I obtain the interaction of great nature - to be considered.)</p>

<p>"Have you gone to school?" W asked again.</p>
<p>"..." Little Tiger seemed to have swallowed a stone egg whole and was unable to chew it.</p>
<p>"He's been to some," Yaoqun replied with a smile. "I asked him, he's been in their village for more than half a year, so I know something: he's probably read a "Three Character Classic," a "Hundred Family Surnames," a "Four-Character Primer," and a "Youth's Primer," and two "Four Books," probably the Analects. Later, I taught him a book of elementary school common sense, a little history and geography. Since the September 18th Incident and the fall of the provincial capital, the textbooks have all been changed, and I can't buy suitable textbooks for a while... As long as Little Tiger is with me often, I think I should take some responsibility..."</p>
<p>"That's great." I and W blurted out this sentence at the same time. W then said, "Right now, I don't think the two of you will be separated for work... I really want to, because the matter in Tongzhou is very urgent... I want to ask Miss Yaoqun to..." W didn't know Little Tiger's name yet.</p>
<p>"His formal name is Huchen," Yaoqun interjected, "Later, he changed the 'chen' of 'junchen' (ruler and subject) to the 'cheng' of 'city'."</p>
<p>"Yes," W nodded, "I want to ask you two to go to our office tomorrow to complete some procedures, and then, maybe rest there for a day, and go to Tongzhou the day after tomorrow..."</p>
<p>"That's great." Yaoqun also stood up, feeling a little excited, her bright eyes shining with a light. "Since the matter in Tongzhou is so urgent, if you're not afraid of being bothered... if it's possible... could we go to report tonight, right now, complete the procedures, and then we can get on the road early tomorrow morning?" A blush appeared on her slightly tanned cheeks as she spoke.</p>
<p>Since I met W, I have seen emotions on his face, unlike the so-called "poker" faces of general intelligence workers—impassive—but at the same time, he has an indescribable calmness. At this time, he heard Yaoqun's request, and of course, he understood that Yaoqun was not impetuous or superficial, vying to take office immediately, but wanted to seize the "time" factor, so he pondered for a moment and immediately nodded:</p>
<p>"Okay, it's just that you two will be a little tired... Also, are you two familiar with Tongzhou?"</p>
<p>"We have people over there too," Little Tiger couldn't hold back; but he was a little incoherent or didn't answer the question.</p>
<p>"I've been there a few times," Yaoqun took over the conversation. "People in the village often go there, especially Little Tiger, although he's small, he won't get lost inside or outside the customs... His memory is particularly scientific, whether it's people, places, or things, he'll never forget it once he's seen it; and even in the dark, when you can't see your hand in front of your face, he can recognize the direction." Yaoqun explained another of Little Tiger's strengths.</p>
<p>"Good!" W stood up and looked at his watch, "Need to pack up a bit..." he said, glancing around the room.</p>
<p>I also stood up; "We can wait in the car"? Thinking that Yaoqun and the others might need to tidy up their clothes and supplies or something.</p>
<p>"There's nothing to tidy up," Yaoqun said with a smile, "We're always prepared, ready to go. Everyone is familiar with each other, just a greeting!"</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, Little Tiger had already opened the wardrobe, took out a small leather suitcase and a cloth bag, and held them in his hands. His movements were clean and neat, extremely fast; in the light flowing from his big round eyes, there was an unspeakable smile. (End of Chapter 3)</p>

<p>We have decided to send these 1,284 votes, along with the complete original envelopes with postmarks, to the Municipal Council for reference this morning by a special person. We believe that the Municipal Council will not ignore the opinions expressed in this vote when discussing this case.</p>
<p>However, there is one flaw. In the questions we prepared at the time, we did not more specifically solicit "whether the opposition to or support for horse racing is unconditional or conditional." For example, what about holding it in Jiangwan or Yinxiang Port? This is a regrettable thing. Fortunately, the Council will discuss this case soon. The many gentlemen and talented people will certainly have brilliant and perfect solutions.</p>
<h3>The Horse Racing Ban Should Not Be Lifted —The People's Opinions—</h3>
<p>— Weng Zhengping</p>
<p>If the horse racing ban is lifted, it has nothing to do with us low-level staff. We simply don't have the "leisure" to talk about horse racing. As for those who are bankrupted by horse racing, they are ultimately the self-inflicted results of the "leisure class," and we don't need to sympathize with them. At the same time, it can give some unemployed staff in the horse racing association a chance to be "reinstated." On the one hand, the municipal government's tax revenue can increase to 300 to 500 million, which is a win-win situation. Why not do it?</p>
<p>But then again, if horse racing has so many good reasons, why was it banned when the banner of victory fluttered to Shanghai in the first place? Is it because it was one time then and another time now? As for saying that this is legitimate entertainment, then why does the capital ban dancing? After all, dancing does not have gambling properties. I wonder if the gentlemen who are advocating for the opening of the horse racing ban have considered this point and have a self-justifying place?</p>
<p>If the government has the responsibility to lead the people, then what benefits will horse racing bring to people? Is it true that this piece of land is useless except for horse racing? I really don't understand! President Chiang Kai-shek said: "The governance and chaos of the country, and the rise and fall of the nation, often depend on the social atmosphere. The social atmosphere of our China has been affected by unequal treaties, rooted in the concessions, and manifested as 'bad habits.' Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished and the concessions no longer exist, then whose hands will the responsibility of shifting the social atmosphere be in?" Here is a very clear indication for us, which is the responsibility of the people themselves. The government has the responsibility to lead the people, so if the horse racing ban is lifted, will the social atmosphere shift? If it can't be shifted, if it is considered a matter of course, we can ask the government to restore massage parlors and singing girl guide societies, because there is also a group of unemployed people there, and there is also a lot of tax revenue!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Municipal Council has opened, and as representatives of the citizens, they can make great speeches. Whether or not to open the horse racing ban, we small people once voted for you!</p>
<p>To repeat: The horse racing ban should not be lifted, this is the people's request!</p>
<h3>Regarding the Racecourse</h3>
<p>— Jin Sheng</p>
<p>Regarding the racecourse, I have the following opinions: (1) The concession was recovered long ago with the victory, and the sovereignty of the racecourse should be managed by the Chinese. All the few Westerners who are indispensable can only participate as consultants. (2) Considering that in civilized cities around the world, there are no racecourses located in the downtown area, once the competition stirs up dust, it will greatly harm the health of the citizens. Moreover, the gains and losses are quite large, which can easily foster an immoral atmosphere. (3) If the policy of prohibition through taxation is implemented and the horse racing ban is lifted, a new location can be found in the suburbs of Shanghai. "There is also a racecourse east of Jiangwan," and someone once advocated a plan to revitalize "New Shanghai." I think there are also many open spaces there that can be used, so that the "bourgeoisie" have four-wheeled "cars" and it doesn't matter if it's farther away. The so-called distance of ten feet keeps the eyes clear.</p>
<h3>Child Talk, Mother</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaotian</p>
<p>"Mother boiled coffee and brewed a cup for everyone. She put more sugar in Dad's cup each time than in mine. I clamored to have the same amount of sugar as Dad's cup, and she said to me, 'Eating too much sugar will hurt your teeth.'"</p>
<p>"Why doesn't it hurt Dad's teeth when he puts more sugar in his cup?" I thought to myself, but seeing that there was less sugar in Mom's cup than in mine, I didn't say anything." This is what a most intelligent six-year-old child said.</p>
<p>Urban Pathologies</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion on Suicide</h3>
<p>— Zhengfan</p>
<p>Suicide in Shanghai is an old problem, but this problem has never been cured.</p>
<p>This shows the instability of society.</p>
<p>The reason why these suicides hurt themselves is that the vast majority are due to difficulties in making a living, followed by family discord, love suicides, and mental disorders.</p>
<p>In addition to these reasons, in the past, many people committed suicide out of grief and indignation over national affairs. More than ten years ago, She Yi, a supervisor of the Supervisory Yuan, drowned himself in Xuanwu Lake, and countless patriotic people committed suicide after the May Thirtieth Massacre, hoping to awaken the people, and in 1936, Zhou Zixin, a 14-year-old elementary school student, committed suicide by swallowing nitric acid water. All belong to this category.</p>
<p>In suicide cases, there are many questions worth studying for general psychologists. To give an example: Ten years ago, Guan Zhenduo, a Manchu from Beiping, usually liked to read novels such as Dream of the Red Chamber and Flowers in the Mirror. One night, while attending to his great-grandmother's illness, he couldn't sleep, and suddenly had a strange idea and hanged himself. After his death, people from all sides speculated on the reason, but ultimately could not find an appropriate explanation.</p>
<p>But no matter what the reason, suicides are not worthy of sympathy. Legally, suicide is a crime, but it cannot be enforced.</p>
<p>According to statistics, Switzerland has the highest suicide rate in European countries. The reason is that most patients are recuperating in Switzerland, and often when they find that they cannot recover their health, they simply commit suicide. In Asia, Japan is clearly the "most suicidal nation." Their "seppuku" and "jumping into volcanoes" are unique suicide methods handed down from their ancestors.</p>
<p>Suicide Nations</p>
<p>There used to be a "Suicide Society" in Tokyo. The society stipulated that if a member committed suicide first, other members should be notified immediately, and the second member had to commit suicide within six months. The secret must not be revealed until all members have committed suicide. But later, the local police station found a copy of the society's constitution next to a suicide member and began to investigate and ban it.</p>
<p>Atami, Japan, is a famous suicide city. The seaside there has beautiful scenery, and at least twenty people commit suicide by jumping into the sea every day and night, mostly due to love deaths.</p>
<p>Dr. Keogh Clarke of England once statistically analyzed the suicide methods used by men and women in Europe over a period of twenty years. The conclusion was that men most often committed suicide by hanging, followed by shooting and placing themselves on the railway; women most often committed suicide by drowning, followed by taking poison and being crushed to death. However, Clarke's statistics were many years ago. Today, the most common means of suicide is taking poison, accounting for more than 70% of cases. Swallowing lysol, bedbug powder, opium, sleeping pills, DDT "insecticides"... there are many names, too many to list in detail. This can also be taken as evidence of the development of urban science (? ) Research on Suicide</p>
<p>The age at which people are most likely to commit suicide is between 20 and 30 years old. According to statistics, May is the month with the most suicides, and suicides occur most often around 10:00 PM. Usually, there are more male suicides than female suicides.</p>
<p>Suicide is also closely related to the weather. According to the research results of mental hygienists, a tragedy of suicide is most likely to occur when the humidity is between 65 and 80 degrees, the air pressure is between 754 mm and 767 mm, and the temperature is between 20 and 23 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to point out in particular that the suffering of suicides is caused by the shortcomings of society. To get rid of this suffering, the only way is to stand up and engage in the work of transforming society. Seeking relief from suicide is the most cowardly and foolish inferior strategy!</p>

<h3>Li Mo'an, the Scholar General</h3>
<p>— Jin Xia</p>
<p>The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the First Pacification Zone, Lieutenant General Li Mo'an, who is responsible for ensuring the security of the entire Jiangsu Province and parts of Zhejiang and Anhui, is a typical "scholar general."</p>
<p>Rich Experience</p>
<p>He is from Changsha, Hunan Province, a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy and the second class of the Army University's General Class. He is forty-two years old, but has more than twenty years of experience in military administration and combat. During his tenure as "Director of Education at the Southwest Cadre Training Class," he trained more than 8,000 junior and middle-level cadres. He also taught for a period of time. He is the author of six works, including: "National Defense Speeches," "A Consistent Theory of Military Administration and Combat," "Military Education and Youth Training," "Problems in Military Education," and "Essentials of the Officers Corps," all of which are valuable military writings.</p>
<p>The General's experience: In March of the fourteenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1925], he was just a second lieutenant platoon leader, but due to his military exploits, he was successively promoted to company, battalion, and regimental commander. By December of the twenty-eighth year [i.e., 1939], he was honorably appointed as the Lieutenant General Commander-in-Chief of the Xiang-E Border Area Advance Army. In September of the thirty-first year [i.e., 1942], he was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Thirty-second Army Group. In July of this year, he assumed the post of Lieutenant General Commander-in-Chief of the First Pacification Zone.</p>
<p>British King Awards Medal</p>
<p>He has successively been awarded the Third Class Shih Ting Medal, the Third Class Yun Hui Medal, the Loyalty and Diligence Medal, the First Class Grade A Medal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the First Class Kan Cheng Medal by the National Government. In the thirty-fourth year of the Republic [i.e., 1945], he was awarded the C.B.E. (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) Medal by King George VI of England. These many special honors are proof of his loyalty and meritorious service.</p>
<p>Li's military administration is very strict, emphasizing discipline. He also pays attention to regularity in his private life, and it is said that he does not become arrogant despite his important position. He most enjoys appreciating music and calligraphy, and in his spare time, he loves to study and read books, newspapers, and magazines. He has a lot of experience in organizing materials. His favorite sports are horseback riding and playing tennis.</p>
<p>His wife, Madam Gu Xiuling, can be described as a virtuous helper. They have three sons and five daughters, all of whom are studying in primary and secondary schools. The family always maintains due harmony.</p>
<p>Amiable Demeanor</p>
<p>Li's personality can be measured from an interesting anecdote. When he was a brigade commander, he once went to the theater with a friend. The orderly bought the tickets, and the friend and the orderly entered first. Li was slightly behind and was stopped by the ticket collector. He explained that the tickets had been bought by the soldier in front of him. Because Li was wearing a long gown that day and was of short stature, resembling a small businessman, the guard stationed in the theater thought that Li was trying to see the show for free under false pretenses, so he used his rifle to drive Li away, a very embarrassing situation. Later, the orderly came out to look for his master and, seeing this situation, stepped forward to scold the reckless guard. Although Li was insulted, he was not angry and comforted the flustered guard with a smile, saying that his anger was his duty and there was no fault. At the same time, he stopped his own orderly from hitting anyone. We feel that this kind of situation is most needed for soldiers; otherwise, it will be difficult to integrate the military and the people, and officers and subordinates.</p>
<p>In today's world where military vehicles run rampant, soldiers are arrogant, and everyone looks askance, one cannot help but miss the demeanor of this scholar general, a truly exemplary soldier!</p>
