<h3>主席卽將離滬赴京　參加軍事復員會議　記者招待會融洽自由</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕蔣主席夫婦此次蒞滬，全市市民歡　若狂，昨日全市商店住戶，仍繼續懸旗，以示歡迎愛戴，而連日天氣晴朗，日暖風和，尤足象徵滬市市民歡迎元首之熱烈興奮情緒。各界人士以八年闊別，無不渴望瞻仰主席丰采，親承訓示，尤以中外新聞記者，連日趨赴東平路主席私邸謁求見者，更踵接不絕，主席夫婦以公務繁忙，未遑一一接見，爰特抽　於昨日上午十一時，假上海市政府會議室，舉行抗戰軍　以來在滬之第一次中外記者招待會，由中宣部駐滬代表辦公處代為柬邀本市中外各報社記者參加。十時半以前，市政府會議室所布置之座席，即已江座，共約七十餘人，咸以興奮愉快之情緒，靜待主席夫婦之蒞臨。</p>
<p>十一時零五分，主席夫婦由張主委道藩，錢市長大鈞陪同，翩然蒞止，全場肅立致敬，各中外攝影記者紛紛向席夫婦攝取彌足珍量之鏡頭。主席御黃呢特級上將軍服，精神煥發，態度慈祥，蔣夫人則衣紫色綢旗袍，外罩栗色絲絨大衣，面含笑容，和靄可親。主席入座後，頻頻含笑點首，並請全塲就座，招待會乃即開始。首由張主席道藩起立宣稱：「今日因主席尙有其他要公待理，故招待會時間，僅能以廿分鐘為限，諸位如有何問題提出，請即在廿分鐘以內完畢，為使主席及夫人與各位認識起見，並請各位記者於提出問題前，先報告本人姓名及所代表之報社名稱」。</p>
<p>主席旋即宣示，「各位如有何意見，請隨便提出詢問」，由沈秘書昌　譯成英語後，各中外記者即自由提出各項問題，主席一一親加解答，其有未能當塲作詳細答復者，則表示，「希望提出書面詢問，俾用書面答復」。蔣夫人在旁，亦問作插言，並代為傳語，如某外籍記者提出，「外傳中蘇兩國正進行秘密談判」一項問題時，誤謂「外傳美蘇兩國」，蔣夫人即立予指正。又當主席答復記者詢問還都日期，謂「政府還都之期，當在五月以前，但尚未決定」，沈秘書　譯英語時，僅稱：「尚未決定」，而遺漏「在五月以前」一語，蔣夫人亦即予指正，沈秘書當表歉意。</p>
<p>主席所答復之問題，共計十五項，外籍記者所提者較多，問題內容，包括內政，外交，經濟等各方而，會場空氣，至為自由融洽，經無任何拘束，充分顯顯示主席尊重方論自由之至意。當招待會時間已過五分鐘，沈秘書宣布結束時，主席猶含笑宣稱：「再延長數分鐘亦可，各位繼讀提出一二問題」，足證主席極樂於與記者接談，聽取新聞界之意見，招待會於十一時三十五分宣告結東，歷時共三十分鐘。散會後，主席應某外籍女記者之請，與彼並立同攝一影後，始偕同夫人步出會場。茲將主席答復各記者問題原詞錄後：</p>
<h3>解答各項重要問題</h3>
<p>記者間（一）外傳中·蘇兩國，正進行秘密談判，聞美國政府要求中·蘇兩國，將談判情形充分告知美國政府，有吾此事？</p>
<p>主席答：關於此事，余在重慶對記者已有說明，現在中蘇之間，並無正式談判，惟關於經濟合作之非正式商談，則時在進行，但並無不可公開告人之事，美國一政府如有此願望，則我們當可隨時告知。</p>
<p>問（二）蘇軍自中國束北九省完全退出之期，蘇聯與中岡政府相的究竟何日爲止？</p>
<p>答：此事早經公布，蘇軍本已想約在二月一日以前退出東北，關於東北詐細情形，今日無暇詳告，諸位如有問題，可用書面提出，將來余可作書面答復。</p>
<p>問（三）中法談判甚久，不知進行有無困難，新的何時可以訂立？</p>

<p>問（五）主席蒞滬後，此間物價頓見下跌，足見有奸商操縱，不知政府今後對於物價能吾採取有效之步驟？</p>
<p>答：政府對於物價，自當作有效之處置。</p>

<p>答：余郎將往南京參加會議。</p>
<p>問（九）政府在政治協商會中，已作重大讓步，中共是否保證眞能放棄其私有之軍隊？</p>
<p>答：余與全國人民，均相信中國共產黨私有之軍隊必能歸還國家，因中共若不能放棄其私有之軍隊，則此次政治協商會議之一切努力均歸無效，而政治協商會議之決議，亦等於具文矣。</p>
<p>問（十）據說在中國境內，尙有若干德國納粹份子未送往集中營，不知主席此次來滬，曾否注意及之？</p>

<p>答：政府改組須待國民黨二中全會後始能實行，故一切問題皆須由二中全會決定，現在外間種種傳說，均屬推測之詞。</p>
<p>問（十三）主席赴京前，是否將返奉化故鄉一行？</p>
<p>答：目前無此閒暇。</p>
<p>問（十四）在華之日本戰犯，中國是否準備審判，主應對於日本之再敎育有何意見？</p>

<h3>主席夫婦招待耆紳　懇切慰問並垂詢八年情形</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕　蔣主席夫婦，昨日下午四時在台拉斯脫路舉行茶會，招待本市耆紳，到顏惠慶·章士釗·陳霆銳·杜月笙·王曉籟·陳文淵·許炳堃·伍特公·胡樸安·黃式金·徐寄廎·顏福慶·勞念祖·馬叙倫·陳夔龍·葉景葵·張元濟·劉崇傑·劉垣·陳冷·李登輝·何炳松·傳統先·魯繼曾·袁希洛·查人偉·蔣維喬·褚鳳儀·金通尹·倪葆春·董任堅·盛振為·樊正康，吳保豐·馮有眞·魏伯楨·金廷蓀·秦潤卿·黃郛夫人·孫王國秀·俞慶棠·高君珊·徐朗西·黃金榮·袁良·惠濟良·趙世光·錢團運·盛懷··金人鑑·王鍾麟及美國敎會方面人士十餘人，尚有張國淦·葉恭綽·陳陶遺·趙志游·嚴惠宇·唐文治等因病未克參加。　蔣主席夫婦，於四時廿分抵達，即由錢市長·吳主委等介紹與到會者一一握手。　主席態度慈祥，熟情畢露，向與會者懇切慰問，備極親切。其中頗多與主席夫婦為素識者，　主席夫婦允殷股垂詢八年來情形，與會者莫不深切感動，旋即就座，略進茶點後，主席起立致詞，向上海耆紳及市民致懇切慰問之意，全塲報以熱烈掌聲，次由顏惠慶氏代表耆紳答詞，最後李登輝氏堅請蔣夫人致詞，夫人以在塲之美國敎會人士甚多，乃以英語發言，詞語雖簡，而情意親切，全體一再鼓掌答謝，至五時許茶會告畢，與會者復一一與　主席夫婦握手道中別。　主席夫婦略事休息後，亦即離去，當時台拉斯脫路上，已人山人海，爭欲一睹　主席夫婦丰采，當主席夫婦乘車出外時，歡聲雷動，如醉如在。茲誌主席夫婦汝顏惠慶氏演詞如次：</p>
<p>蔣主席詞</p>
<p>本人與上海父老及同胞，闊別已八年餘，在此八年餘中，上海父老及同胞，備受敵偽壓迫及蹂躪，但均堅苦奮鬥，共同爭取騰利，今日在此相見，猶如家庭團聚，融和快樂，本人感觸萬端，一片熱情，非言語所可表白。上海為我國最大都市，應為全國表率，希望諸位父老艱苦奮鬥之精神，共同努力建設新國家，庶不負八年來茹苦含辛所獲得之成果，敬以致忱，恭祝諸君健康，並共同完成建國大業。</p>
<p>顏惠慶詞</p>
<p>略謂：恭聆　主席訓示，慰勉，具見對上海市民之關切，令人感　奮。重慶由港來滬，已四五年，對上海之情形比較熟悉，可向　主席簡單報告，回憶日本投降之初，惠慶奉蔣伯誠先生轉達　主席之命，慰問集中營內英美僑民，當時曾向彼等說過，集中營內肉體方面所受之痛苦，並非眞正之痛苦，最痛苦者，實為抗戰期內無機會為祖國效力，英美僑民對此語均甚感動。抗戰八年中，上海實為一個大集中營，上海市民，肉體上所受痛苦，實不足道，而精神因不能與內地同胞同樣為抗戰努力，實在非常痛苦。抗戰勝利後內地同胞對上海市民艱苦情形，頗多不了解者，但上海三百萬市民中，雖有少數敗類，然多數皆愛國家，並能出錢出力，舉辦慈善及敎育事業，最近數月來，內地同胞對上海市民已明白瞭解，大家同心同德，共謀繁榮上海。八年來上海市政廢馳，馬路不修，陰溝不通，碼頭破壞，均亟待修復，惟需款浩大，非上海市政府力所能及，敢請　主席特加關注。前次　主席赴平，未蒞滬土，上海市民，莫不失望，昨日　主席與夫人翻然蒞止，全市市民歡欣若狂，情緒熱烈，皆出至誠，此情此景，猶如孤兒之見父母也，僅代表全市父老向　主席及夫人致敬。</p>
<p>蔣夫人詞</p>
<p>略謂：此次與主席來滬，看見許多老友，無任欣快。頃顏先生致詞，謂內地同胞對上海市民之情形不甚瞭解，實不盡然。余可為諸君述一故事，上月余赴東北，據友人談稱：日軍侵佔東北時，强迫東北同胞，每晨必須為日本天皇祈禱，東北同胞確皆邀命祈禱，然非為日本天皇祈禱，而係為國民政府祈禱。　主席及余皆確信上海亦復如此，上海市民除少數敗類外，固皆盡忠其國家也，早以抗戰時期，內地同胞以武力為國家奮鬥，上海同胞則民氣發揚，予全國以精神上之鼓勵，余更須表示感激者，上海市民於抗戰期中，曾盡力捐款，使傷兵，孤兒及抗戰將士家屬得獲經濟上之援助。現抗戰已勝利結束，淪陷區與自由區猶如一大家庭，無分彼此，所謂四海之內，皆兄弟也。</p>
<h3>人民陳訴函　接獲百餘件</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕主席於抗戰勝利後首次蒞滬巡視，對民間疾苦至為關切，特設行轅秘書處，接受人民陳訴。據悉，昨日秘書處已接獲函件一百入十餘件，其中陳訴告密函有一百二十餘封之多，聞告密函中大都為檢舉漢奸，亦有涉及行政官吏者。</p>
<h3>總裁親自接見　蒙難同志代表　訓話十分鐘慰勉有加</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕記者招待會後主席即至秘書長辦公室內，以總裁身份接見蒙難同志之代表蔣伯誠夫人·吳開先·戴濟民·陶廣川·費彝民·姜夢麟·王微君·錢劍秋·萬墨林·呂恩潭·毛子佩·陳寳驊·吉震昌·羅亞西·朱雯·聞天聲·陸惠民·張小通夫人等五十人。對諸同志在過去八年中之艱苦奮鬥，慰勉有加，並希望今後繼續努力，訓話的十分鐘完畢，即與全體蒙難同志代表在市府合留一影，以誌紀念。同時，蒙難同志向總裁面遞書面要求五項，要求嚴懲漢奸，設立蒙難同志子弟學校，救濟殉難同志家屬等，總裁對嚴懲漢奸一點，連稱：「應當應當」。</p>
<h3>主席昨參觀美旗艦　並檢閱中國海軍艦艇受訓員兵　事前並曾出現市府陽台與歡迎羣衆相見</h3>

<h3>血濺越南·淚洒暹羅！　華僑竟成活靶子　南洋歸客連敎授目擊慘案之一席談</h3>
<p>勝利後的南洋各地，時有排華事件的演出，小至個人的遭受侮辱，大至集團的生命財產的喪失。我們不禁懷疑起來，難道祖國在這次戰爭中，沒獲得勝利？為什麼站在同一勝利綫上的英法盟友，對這些不絕如縷的排華事件，態度是顯得那末的微妙曲折？</p>
<p>前天下午，本報記者獲得偶然的機緣，和剛從南洋飛來的連求艾敎授，促膝長談，茲將談話內容錄下。</p>
<h3>法越衝突　華僑處境困難</h3>
<p>述敎授過去在北平執敎，七七事變後，轉輾遷到香港，在嶺南大學敎經濟史。太平洋砲聲爆發，他又渡海遠赴越南，改名換姓，困居離西貢二百多里的鄉間，除執敎和譯著，來消磨他四年的苦悶生活。日本屈膝後，他到了西貢，親眼看到華僑現實生活中的苦難，他曾幾次三番的代表他們向當地的負責當局交涉接洽。後來他又到曼谷，看到了暹羅華僑的種切，說來字字血淚，語語悲憤。</p>
<p>他說：法越正式衝突，是去年九月二十三日開始的。西貢地方的華僑，大多集居在西堤地方。法越正面衝突開始後，西堤一帶的損毁情形，相當慘重。到了十月初，英當局出面調停，其後法兵一批批的陸續開到，談判宣告次裂。此後，法人看到越人便設，越人看到法人便也同樣殺，華僑的處境，相當困難。越人要求華僑罷市，華僑接受後，法人又來責難。十月中，厄運終於光降到西貢華僑的頭上。那時候，有一批英印軍開到，就實施姦淫擄掠，當時我被推為代表，向英當局辦交涉。英當局起初否認，後來說要提出實據，迨實據提出，又無具體辦法。</p>
<p>談到這裏，連光生舉出了一個例子。</p>
<h3>西堤華女　橫遭輪姦悲劇</h3>
<p>他說：有一天晚上，越南西堤有一處華僑的集中區裘，驀地闖來了幾個英印軍，開始輪姦一個華僑女子，她的丈夫出外呼援，凑巧有一個安南人經過，跑進來把英印軍中的一個，開槍打死。其他的幾個，就趕回部隊裏報告，當即派來了一隊兵，硬指這區裏有越民黨，於是放一把野火，燒去了幾百幢房子。燒的時候，又禁絕人去搶救。災區裹的難僑，無家可歸，紛紛集中到當地的華僑團體七府公所去，雖經推派代表交涉，仍然一場沒結果。</p>
<p>不久，法人開到了堤案，越民黨人以拋擲手溜彈對付，法人拿重機關槍掃射，華僑的集中區，變成了活的靶子！自然，這又是一批死傷損失！</p>
<p>十二月中，法人的搶刧變本加厲。二十五日晚上，法兵裝滿了三卡車，開到了華僑集中區，名義上說是搜查越民黨，實際上是挨戶搜劫，看到女人，就是姦淫侮辱，看到男人，非打即駡，看到金錢珠寶，就囊括入袋，甚致檯上賸留下來的一塊餅也給搶去。漫漫的黑夜裹，各地都厲行着戒嚴令，僑胞不能越雷池一步，呼援無門，對法兵的搜刧，是予取予求，沒絲毫的抵抗。第二天，華僑代表，向法當局提出交涉，法方又是一味的說要證據，這樣的不了了之。</p>
<p>這樣的洗刧，華僑平均每天要有十人死於非命，財產每天的損失，達一百萬越幣。（越幣一元，約合法幣五十元。）幾個月來，營業又無法展開，間接的無形損失，更是不可勝數！</p>
<p>談到經濟方面，越南的華僑也無不處處遭受排擠。法當局在去年十一月十八日一紙命令，把所有法商東方匯理銀行發行的五百元票面鈔劵，宣告作廢。</p>
<h3>鈔券作廢　五百元等於零</h3>
<p>現在這批鈔券百分之八十，是在華僑手中，尤其是小本經商的僑胞，因為預備空襲時携取款項便利起見，都兌就了大額票面的鈔劵。在這道廢止令頒發之下，華僑小民即遭了致命傷，華僑產業也就全盤宣告了破產！交涉結果，法當局終算答應把法政權時期該行所發的五百元券，照票面七折收兌。而對於日人佔領時期所發行的，仍根本不予承認。當地一張法人辦的「正義報」因為抨擊「五百元等於零」的措置，竟橫遭法當局封閉。</p>
<h3>暹京排華　交涉竟無下文</h3>
<p>談到這裏，我們的話鋒，乃轉到暹京最近的排華事件上去。連先生剛從暹京飛馬尼刺不久，對這事件的內幕，簡直瞭如指掌。他滔滔不絕的說着首先提出暹羅的國民性，充滿了低劣感，（Inferiority　Complex）。低劣感的特點，是一面要附庸於大國，一面却又要假借大國的勢力，來壓迫其他的國家，過去，暹羅曾流行著十種口號，說：寗為英人做牛馬，不願與華僑做朋友，日軍佔領期間，暹人更極盡壓迫華僑之能事，且大言不慚的說：「在遠東，日本第一，暹羅第二！」打死個把華僑，不算一回事，告到官廳，勝訴的總是暹人，坐牢的總是華僑！</p>
<p>這次，祖國獲得最後勝利的消息，傳到暹京時，忍氣呑聲了多少年頭的華僑，便不顧一切的，把國旗一面面的張掛起來，暹人竟又出而干涉，堅主慶祝勝利，只能掛暹旗，於是衝突發生了。僑胞們雖手無寸鐵，可是民氣却很盛，結果遭到了當地軍警的一塲大屠殺。事後，華僑代表跟當局交涉，結果沒有下文，坐令事態日趨擴大。</p>
<p>暹羅國雖小，可是外交手腕却相當高明。今年一月四日，中央海外部特派員邢森洲先生抵達曼谷時，暹政府特派專車迎迓。一月九日，中國赴暹代表團李鐵錚先生等一行八人，也到了曼谷。暹政府招待酬酢，顯得相當熱絡。一月二十四日，邢特派員到萬邦地方參觀視察，沒遭到什麼意外，可是二十七日李團長等一行，下鄉參觀，不幸出亂子，死傷華僑多人，事後李團長曾向暹政府提出嚴重交涉，暹政府答應負責調查損失，結果又是沒有下文</p>
<p>至於中暹條約草案，最近雖已簽字，可是暹人堅持兩點：（一）國籍問題，照暹國法律，凡在暹羅生長的華僑，就算暹人，這條法律如果沒法修正，那末許多華僑，無非都是給暹羅人添丁發財而已。（二）華僑敎育問題，這點經代表團據理力爭的結果，暹政府只准規定，學校課程時間三分之一講授中文，其餘時間純授暹文，這對華僑國民敎育的影響，是太嚴重了！</p>
<p>法西斯的遺毒還深，要眞正的親善，至少還需要十年，而先次條件，還得要看祖國建立對外的力量。僑胞們已經透視到，只有祖國的團結和富强，才能爭回他們在海外旣失的地位，取得祖國整個的　遠的眞勝利！（本報記者蒼龍。十二日）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>投機漲價誰負其責？</h3>
<p>主席蒞臨上海之日，黃金美鈔在在漲中忽露傾瀉，人們方慶幸這些投機家或可知所顧忌，稍稱歛跡，升斗小民也可在物價高漲聲中得以喘息。詎知前昨兩天，他們故態復萌，黃金抬到一萬四千元，美鈔抬到二千元，由是一般物價也追蹤飛漲。一般人都想把法幣換貨物，而恃薪工為生的人，乃在此投機囤貨的兇燄中，大有窒息就死的可能！這是目前上海市民切膚之痛的第一件大事。</p>
<p>上海向爲全國第一都市，今天上海的游資作祟，投機成習，必然更會領導着全國的通都大邑，萬流奔競，爭趨此路。於是戰爭期間的重慶昆明，以視今天的上海，眞如小巫見大巫，膛乎其後。故上海今天的金鈔飛漲，上海的物價暴騰，其勢必然引起南北各地的金鈔漲，物價貴，而全國平民的生計乃痛感極大的壓迫。由此可見上海市場近來異乎尋常的激動，不但上海市民認為第一件大事，也實在是全國人民所共同認為一等大事！</p>
<p>但是事情儘管急到火燃眉目，大到狂潮泛濫，而眞正勞心焦思，恨不得立刻撲減兇燄挽回狂瀾的，究竟有幾個人？除了　主席關心民瘼，三令五申，責成主官設法遏制而外，到今天我們還不曾看見應該負責的當局拿出什麼具體辦法來。所貴乎政府者，就在正視現實，抱己飢己溺的精神，為大多數平民解除痛苦。所貴乎政治家者，就在高瞻遠矚，當機立斷，理所應為，毫不猶豫。我們今天最不可解的欵間，就是上海市場非法交易的投機行為，自從勝利以來，五六個月，從沒有停止過，而何以當局熟視無睹？政府的黃金政策，究竟是要變還是不變，新外匯率究竟規定還是不規定，今天這樣說，明天又那樣傳，一任市場投機者的造謠，而主管又充耳不聞。他們甚至揑造電報，掀風作浪，不是從南京傳來說要發「孫」票，就是從香港硬說市慶要定美匯為二千元，連香港當局都忍不住要澈究，而陪都汝上海的主官鎭定得若無其事。最可笑的，他們把國家所發的公債，也做他們投機賭博的籌碼，揣測將要拿「孫」票替代法幣來還本付息，由此以為抬價之藉口，而主官亦復不聞不問。總之，上海的市塲，整個已經沒有了軌道，狂　疾馳，橫衝直撞，而半年之間，迄未見負責當局有絲毫的舉措。還是他們無能？還是他們有心不問？</p>
<p>姑置投機買賣於不論，而推究一般物價的高漲。其大原因固不外通貨之膨脹，與物資之缺少。但我們應不忘記，當勝利初臨，物價曾一度普徧下跌。而何以五六個月之中，竟然漲上四倍五倍？即以收復區而言，政府接收的敵僞工廠物資，一切產業不可謂不多。除了東北尚有特殊阻碍而外，試問各地能否充分利用此種物資，抑平物價？上海的敵僞產業處理局，固有若千物品號稱平賣，但大都分批辦理，八折發售。於是市價漲，則平價亦漲，平價漲則市價又漲，循環往復，收效幾何！更可異者，中國舫織建設公司拋售紗布，新春紅盤，首先抬價。紗布官價旣漲，商市遂跟蹤而上。這種眼光如豆的「算盤」主義者以為替公家在紗布上多賺一些錢，於計良得，殊不知因此刺激而一般物價俱漲，姑不論小民生計所增痛苦何如，即政府一切開支之因而增加者必更千倍萬倍於此數。推而廣之，一般工廠，接收而後，或調查，或發還，或估價標售，層層手續，節節牽制，機關與機關爭權，政府與人民爭利，公文往返，爭辯無休，而工廠之多數停閉如故，物資之走漏蹧蹋如故。旣明知物資之本來已少，而乃忍心聽其不作最善之運用。旣明知中國工廠本來不多，而乃不加緊努力以促各廠之開工。旣沒有大量資本充分氣魄，一律斷然國營，却又不願效開手來，讓大家趕緊民營。國營也好，民營也好，人民只希望趕快開工生產，增加物資，而今天則離此目的，路程還很遙遠。大家看見工廠多不開門，物資漸用漸少，加以投機狂風的疾捲，自然趨於快買貨物之一途。然則由於這種心理而促成的漲價，究竟誰應負其責任，不難「思過半矣」。</p>
<p>說到通貨問題，我們不容諱言，今天已在膨脹的過程中，而應該杜絕惡性的膨脹。如果財政當局有政策，負責任，早該拿出具體有效的辦法來。今天的問題，我們如再不趕速緊縮通貨，穩定幣値，則國家經濟前途實有無窮禍患！而穩定緊縮之道，方法雖多，主要還是「先內後外」四大字。某經濟學家亦曾力主先將法幣在國內之購買力予以穩定，再求提高，然後方可以重定外匯比率。我們姑不論新外匯率之應高應低，以及重定匯率時期之應早應遲，而法幣如果聽其在一般人心目中長此貶値，讓他們看不起法幣而只看重貨物，則財政常局固屬失策，而整個政府亦必大受其累。要穩定幣値，必須緊縮通貨。要緊縮通貨，必須開源節流。這固是老生常談，而畢竟是不易的至理。我們要問：政府這幾月來，節過什麼流？開過什麼源？我們只聽到今天開會，明天議事，今天設一局，明天設一會。我們又聽到政府行將改組，委員要加多，衙門要添設，這黨分幾部，那派佔幾位。機關林立，疊床架屋。儘管設公務員窮苦，而公務員却偏偏增多。表面說裁軍，說縮編，而各地方某些武力則正為着要縮編而儘先招募民兵，擴充實力。如此這般，官多吏多，將多兵多，開支那得節省？至於開源，則究竟有否增關新稅？有吾杜絕中飽？有吾除了添印鈔票以外，還打算過募集公債，運用凍結外匯？有否注意到輔助工商事業，培養民力，增厚稅源？要吃鷄蛋不可殺鷄的道理，當局一定明白，究竟財政部與經濟部有吾同心協力，對扶植民族工業發展國際貿易，積極作有效的揹施？我們　繭抽絲的問下去，則源之不速開，流之不速節，就是通貨不能緊縮的大原因，而通貨不緊縮，則幣値不穩定。由是而物價騰漲的責任誰屬，又可不煩言而明。</p>
<p>春秋責備賢者。我們雖明知投機操縱，國有常刑，囤積居奇，法所不許，然而我們對於負責主官的熟視無睹，姑息因循，上負主席督責之殷，下負人民喁喁之望，為國計，為民生，究竟不能默無一言。</p>

<h3>請撥市區敵產收入　充復興本市經費　市政諮議會昨日通過　將呈請中央予以照准</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市政諮議委員會，於昨日下午四時會議中通過潘序倫委員之提案，其建議路調：</p>
<p>百廢待舉限於財力</p>
<p>「本市自收復以來，百廢待舉，復興建設，刻不容緩。若浦江失濬，碼頭待修，道路橋樑以及公共衛生之改進，在在均需鉅款。而本市財政收支非但不能平衡，且每月所短甚鉅，當局幾經討論，終感無法彌補，收支旣不能相抵，更遑論復與建設。因念此次政府處理敵偽產業所得甚鉅，故擬請求中央政府將處理上海市區以內敵偽產業所得之收入劃撥一部分為本市地方復興建設經費。</p>
<p>復興建設當務之急</p>
<p>其理由共分五項：（一）按諸財政原理，中央稅源如出之於地方，征收之權屬諸中央，而稅收中之一部，仍撥歸地方應用。現上海市區內之敵僞產業亦有地方性之存在，似亦應援照賦稅原理，劃撥一部為地方復興建設之用。（二）本市一切原有之公共建築，因戰事關係，年久失修，或竟遭損壞。茲抗戰勝利，復興建設允為當務之急，如以處　理勝利所得之一部充當地因戰爭損害之修復費用，於理極通。（三）上海為我國第一大都市，上海之復興與繁榮其影響將及全國，例如疏濬浦江，修建碼頭，靡不與我國之復興建設有關，是上海可謂兼有地方性與全國性之都市，其復興建設更急不可緩。</p>
<p>用於本市實極公平</p>
<p>（四）上海之敵僞產業雖自各地集中而來，然上海所受戰爭上威脅及所冒毁滅之危險最大，故如劃得處理敵僞產業之收入為本市所用，亦無不公平處也。（五）前見報載消息語蔣主席在北平時，曾向當地各界代表表示可在當地敵僞產業處理所得中酌撥一部份作為當地復興建設之用，三席明燭秋毫，而恩澤不遺，此次，駕臨本市，必懷有同樣之德意。</p>
<p>據悉：此項提案，將由市諮議委員會發起聯合本市各公團逕呈市政府轉呈中央政府，予以照准</p>
<h3>本市道路僑梁　積極整修</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市道路在敵僞八年期間損壞甚多，經市工務局統計，應修路面共計三十四萬方公尺，該局現已修竣者達十五萬餘方公尺，的佔應修總數之百分之四十五。其中主要者有中華路·民國路·西藏北路·南路·林森西路·及虬江碼頭等處。關於本市橋樑之修理，該局統計本市二百餘座橋樑中應修者佔百分之七十以上。目前正在修理之主要橋樑，計曹家渡橋，新閘橋及黃興路橋等處，不久均將完工。</p>
<p>拓寬各路先後施工</p>
<p>上海市工務局對於全上每道路已擬定全盤改善計劃，今第一期工程為各路逐叚之改善。茲悉：最近該工務局之道路改善工程如次：（一）南京西路跑馬廳北路面拓寬為二十公尺，明溝三百二十八公尺，塡平裝設溝管，全部工程業已於本年一月八日開工，預計三月初旬可以全部完工。（二）天目路為北火車站通至市中之總幹綫，業經擬定拓寬為二十五公尺，連人行道爲三十五公尺寬，中立月台，兩側分設快慢車道。將於三月初旬開工，預期六月底前可以完工。（三）自梵皇渡路貫通南北經愚園路宣化路而至中正西路之鎭寗路，將於三月中旬開工，預期六月下旬可以完工。（四）徐家匯路西藏南路，製造局路，方斜路，陸家浜路交叉處，擬設小花園旋轉車道。將於三月中旬開工，預計三月底前可以完工。</p>
<h3>本市整編保甲完竣　計七十萬餘戶</h3>
<p>本市自一月十五日起整編保甲至一月底止，已完全編竣。茲據市府民政處公佈合計全市為二十九個區，一千零三〇保，二萬三千三百甲，七十萬零五千一百三十戶。惟未接收區域除外，水上船戶保甲，現正在計劃編組中，亦未列入上列保甲戶數之內。至於全市之口數，性別，敎育程度汝職業等項，則須俟十六日起淸查戶口後，大約在三月初方可全部統計發表。</p>
<h3>電力工潮圓滿解決　勞資雙方昨簽字　吳開先希望雙方合作</h3>

<h3>粵菜業今可復業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕半月未解次之粵菜業工潮，勞資雙方遵照社會局之調解決定書，定於今日起復業。惟四姊妹咖啡館資方以為非粵菜業，故對調解決定書所規定小賬分配，不能同意。社會局將於今晨傳該館經理勸諭。</p>

<p>本市米價自舊曆新年後隨物價波動，扶搖直上，以上週末漲風最熾。糧政當局，為調節民食，穩定糧價計，特作有效抑平米價方法，業經拋出大量薄稻蕪秈，昨前兩日，共計一萬石以上。價格均較小二千元一石，市勢轉見回跌，同時並顧及糧商，力求價格穩定合理，避免暴漲暴跌，影響來源，並扶助運輸給與優先便利，以及舉行貸款予米商，儘量採購，上海最近擁有人口的四百餘萬，除食麵粉及雜糧外，平均每日耗米的六七十萬石，來源以蘇常昆錫蕪湖一帶居多，數雖可驚，然去年豐收，據精密調查，產區售出至今僅佔百分之卅左右。過去敵人統制收括，到此時期，各地存糧，早已不足半數，試觀勝利以前，全市米商不過二百，現已增至一千六七百家之多，其活躍可知。又悉：善後救濟總署，不久將由外洋裝運食米計廿萬噸（即二百七十五担）來滬，如果再切實剷除不肖之徒，秉機造謠高抬市價及制止投機家收購國集情事，則米價前途，當可穩定。</p>
<h3>堡壘鐵柵　拆除完竣</h3>

<h3>敵偽強佔土地　一律查明發還</h3>
<p>本市在敵偽時期，房地產被强行徵用者甚夥，市地政局軫念擁有地產之市民，八年來橫遭蹂躪，依據行政院製訂公佈收復區土地權利淸理辦法，釐訂上海市土地襯利淸理辦法，予以淸理。聞凡被敵僞强佔，或徵用之土地，必須一律查明發還。如仍有機關部隊使用，亦應以保障業主產權為重。審度實際是否需要情况，依法由政府辦理徵用手續。該局為受理市民朱春桂等請求，發還强行徵用坐落引翔區共計地三十六畝三分六厘案，經傳訊核騐證件，確被敵僞恒產公司所徵用，依照土地權利淸理辦法施行細則第五條之規定，「經敵偽組織給價徵收之土地，除有重大公共需要者，仍應政府暫為保管，並補正徵用手續外，原所有權人得提出證件，繳價領回」。惟該恒產公司為敵僞產業處理局接收，特於昨日公函蘇浙皖敵僞產業處理局查復，以憑辦理。</p>

<h3>讀者來函倡議　千元建國獻金運動　本欄代收獻金願大家推行</h3>
<p>主筆先生：我是個職業靑年，在抗戰期中對國家無所貢獻，如今共享勝利之光輝，實覺慚愧無地，惟抗戰雖經勝利，建國尚在開始，此時猶不失為一報效國家之機會，鄙人力量薄弱，謹先獻上國幣一千元，充作「建國獻金」，自知數微，於事無補，倘蒙貴報登高一呼，則以我四萬萬又五千萬同胞每人獻納千元計，就有四千五百萬萬元之數，對建國工作之進行似可大有補益。或云貧寒者無力獻納，然富有者除自身而外，不妨請彼等替十個百個甚或千個萬個貧寒者獻納。若恐全國幅員遼闊，未必人人知道有「千元建國獻金運動」這回事，那可仿照「耶穌幸福函」之連環傳遞方法，即一人獻納「建國獻金」後，再寫十封勸獻函件寄與親友，彼之親友接信後亦如法泡製，如是一傳十，十傳百，百傳千，千傳萬，必收大效，我衷心盼禱這個運動能够早日達到預期之目標，一償心願，此全賴貴報之賜予贊助，與與論界之協助宣傳，銀行界之代勞收款，同胞之熱烈響應，庶幾有成也。讀者王哲倫鞠躬</p>

<h3>金鈔證券愈高　暗息高至一角八美鈔扒結者甚多</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因北帮及外商購買，籌碼奇缺，美鈔方面助力甚多，中途雖盤，無奈投機商故態復萌，游資見機紛紛爭購，易於拉上，一般心理，對掛牌問題，由猜疑而更形固定，賣戶幾吿絕跡，自一二八萬五，逐步爭榮，近午隔前浮空抵補，午收遂以一三九萬五高價收市，較前收猛騰十四萬七，午後復盤出一四大關，站住頗穩，人心更俏，隔夜交割，遂飛黃勝達，初開一四三萬，最高一四五萬八，銀根奇緊，暗息達一角八，逢高右所出籠，一度退至一三九萬五，最後一四一萬左右，飾金掛一五萬三，紋銀一千四，銀元八百元強，暗拆以銀根步緊，自一角二分至一角八分。</p>
<p>美鈔昨仍因美棉定貨關係，結款浩大，一般外商亦來補進，看高之呼聲復高，晨開一八六〇元，最低一八五〇元，廠商汝一般紗布帮猛力扒結，此後盤旋而高，午後竟哄到一九七〇元，後稍回，結果較前收漲九十元，港票上塲，因報載該地申鈔因有人買聯合社名義，誤報美匯掛二千對一，引起跌風，此事現由港政府澈查，業已回好之訊，上塲平平，無如紗花大戶預　印棉結款，老貨突有大量買戶，結果極俏，較前收再漲二十元，新貨亦帶好七元。</p>
<p>公債昨極平穩，丙種晨開即升爲二〇一〇元，業中迫於銀根，逢高紛紛出籠，遂自二〇六〇元漸漸回跌，巾途曾見一八八〇元，午刻在一九五〇元左右徘徊，午收結果較前收計甲乙各好一百元，丙種一六〇元，丁種升一五〇元，戊種一一〇元。</p>
<p>華股昨續趨堅定，高後稍現恍惚，收後喊價曾稍見挫，午後受金市刺激，又復轉漲，查永紗晨開二五五〇元，高價二六八〇元，午收二六〇〇元左右，美亞高價二一五〇元，低價一九五〇元，業中頗多出紗廠，進美亞，套頭活動，午收仍升爲二一〇〇元，景福自晨開一二四元，步升至一四〇元，午收一三七元左右，較之前收計永紗升一〇〇元，信和九〇元，美亞三百元，景福十八元，新光十三元，勤興十元，冷門各股，件好半成左右。</p>

<h3>讓孩子動手！</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>在上海，普通人家的孩子，都養尊處優，筷來伸手，飯來開口，這似乎成了上海社會的一般風尙。當孩子三五歲到六七歲，做父母的說孩子們還小，不會動手；自八九歲到十三四歲，孩子們會動手，也喜歡動手，但做父母的，不肯讓他們動手，以爲一家雜務，要孩子們動手，會被鄰居們看不起，有碍體面；十四五歲以上，做父母的要他們動手，他們旣已養成習慣，看動手常作麻煩，以爲苦事，有些還自高身分，以爲這些原是佣人的勾當，而不屑爲之，結果到了成人，不但對家庭細瑣，無處理能力；便是管理佣僕，也沒這種智識，任憑佣僕浪費躱懶，做事不當，只有聽之而已。而本人還養成一種虛榮的自尊心，態度傲慢，看輕下人，指頤使氣，低視勞働界，以及所謂『下等職業』，永不能瞭解這複雜社會的眞相，便是當了政，也是個不能體念民間疾苦的人。</p>
<p>我國古代敎育，小學注重灑掃應對，從學習自己動手開始，確是合乎實際。一個新時代的父母，會讓孩子們發揮自己的能力，不常代勞，養成他獨立自動的精神；又常鼓勵他操勞雜作，給他們體念作事的經騐。比如掃地，不是單掃地中央，揩桌要把抹布攤開，不要捻作一團；洗碗筷要揩乾；泡茶水要泡出茶汁來，不讓茶葉上浮；整理房間，如何安置落位；生煤爐有什麼門檻；洗衣服如何利用肥皂，其手續渦程如何；煮飯要放多少水；怎樣燒一盌好吃的小菜。舉凡種種家常雜作，理能無一不會，女孩子更要自幼學習烹飪及裁剪製衣，這並不是說呌婦女們回到廚房去，有了經騐，便能管理佣僕；佣僕有不能不會之處，還可做個榜樣，或敎導他們。尤其自幼照應弟妹，從母親方法，學習些保育嬰兒的經騐，比較從書本中採取理論來得寳貴得多！</p>
<p>筆者出生農家，先父對待子女，便是讓我們自己動手，什麼都要幹，對普通家務什作不用說，便是對其外一切可能學習的，都讓我們學習。五歲便要牧牛，六七歲便要上山，後來上城住讀，每逢假期回家，便有工作等候我去做，拔草，戽水，還是小事，還得參加割稻，砍柴，弄船，捉魚種種：結果我體念過一切，知道「汗滴禾下土」的辛苦；知道弄船的危險，便學會了游水；砍柴的吃力；以及如何當販子呌賣；連樣索兒，劈篾淸，做草鞋，搖船，種蔬菜，几農家盡有的工作都能，處世四十載，儘彀應用，我眞感謝先父對我們的栽培。現在謹以自身所得的實益，來貢獻凡作父母者的借鏡，我再說一句：『讓孩子們動手！』</p>

<h3>送孩子進托兒所</h3>
<p>— 朱綺</p>
<p>在重慶時，該做的事從淸晨做至半夜選做不完。孩子又還祗有兩歲。要管管他，可以一整天做不了一點事。不去管他，又沒有地方玩，一天不知跌多少交，碰多少次頭。臉上的傷痕一疤未平，一疤又起。在門口玩，又學來了許多打人駡人的壞脾氣。找了一個女傭來帶他，却是又要吃，又要拿。在主人面前還好，主人不在時就動不動打孩子。自已一面在做事，一面還得時時注意孩子，看那女傭是否又將孩子抱到又擠又髒的對面酒店裏去了，看她可是又買了沾滿灰塵的芝蔴糖在給孩子吃了。而且那傭人又會放刁，做錯了事，說她幾句，她立刻就會要走。初到朮慶時，本來就想把孩子放進托兒所去，可是那時聽到我這個主張的太太小姐們都一致反對，認爲自已的孩子祇有自已來帶才好。我自已也親眼看到由托兒所裏傳染了紅眼睛來的孩子。當時孩子還很小，又是三天兩天就鬧病，所以我也就打消了這個意思。現在給傭人一氣，又想起了托兒所來。</p>
<p>這時正好市慶女靑年會要創辦一個托兒所，主持者就是以前曾在上海女靑年會主持過工人托兒所的卞煦孫女士，我對她頗爲信仰，托兒所所址離家又近，就決定將孩子送去。</p>
<p>入所前先得檢查身體。孩子如果有傳染病，就不能進去，三天以後開始入所。在這三天中，我要替他預備在托兒所中午睡用的小被，大白圍涎，補好破了的衣服褲子，還要在每一條手帕·毛巾·被單·衣褲·圍涎上面，用顏色錢繡上孩子的名宇，眞有些像趕嫁妝的樣子。</p>
<p>到了入所的那天，我隔夜已將孩子要穿的衣服，要帶去的衣·被·毛巾·洗淨的布鞋等分別放好包好，淸晨起來，將孩子洗得乾乾浄浄，解過了大小便，換上了衣服鞋襪，再將一條繡好了名字的手帕用別針扣在他的衣襟上。帶他到了托兒所，竟是第一個到。</p>
<p>托兒所中除了主持的卡小姐外，還有護士一位，敎師二位，保姆二位，男女傭各一，因為是初創，祗有十五六個從兩歲至四歲的孩子，所以照顧得十分周到。</p>
<p>孩子到所以後，先是健康檢查，如果發現有些發燒，就使他睡在隔離室中；如果熱度增高，就通知家屬來接回去。檢查以後才吃早餐，開始一天的遊戲和學習，直等吃完晚飯才回家。孩子早餐吃的是豆漿麵包，午餐晚餐有一菜一湯，總是猪肝鷄蛋蔬菜之類，比家裏吃的更富於營養。下午還有一次點心。吃得如此好，又有許多家裏沒有的玩具，家裏沒有的照顧和衛生設備，每月的費用還比一個傭人的工錢便宜一點，他吃的·偸的·和給孩子的壞影響還不在內。</p>
<p>旣將孩子送進了托兒所，家裏淸靜了許多，可是心裏總覺得空空洞洞的，似乎是太寂寞，又似乎覺得對不起孩子。親友知道了也都責備我。可是過了兩個星期，孩子本來吃飯有人　，還得說上許多話才肯吃下一碗去的，現在自已會吃了，每餐能吃一碗湯，一碗多飯，一滿碟菜，而且吃得很快。本來睡覺要人抱，現在爬上床自已睡，半夜也不再醒。胖了不少。說話進步很快，還學會了唱歌。我自已每天祗須接送孩子，再替他洗一次澡，其餘的時間都可以靜心做事，親友們也贊成我的主張了，因爲一個管理優良的托兒所，已用事實說服了他們的偏見。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>懷女勇士</h3>
<p>— 張篷</p>
<p>腦海間，常常盤旋着一個移不去的影子。眼睫時時閃躍着一個赶不開的影子。這頑强的影子，便是我一直欽敬着的女友——楊惠敏小姐。</p>
<p>八年了，我和她睽隔地沒有晤遇也已八年了；自抗戰勝利以還，已經五個多月的日子了，我天天在盼冀着她回歸上海，留心報紙，覓詢親友，但都失望地一點打聽不出她的行踪。</p>
<p>『篷，我給你介紹，』我正埋着頭忙於編輯『時事壁報』，童子軍程仁厚天眞地跳攏我底案前，滿臉聚了笑，他身際站着一個身子高强的女童軍，她底臉也掛着笑，兩眼炯炯地閃着可愛的光芒：『她是楊惠敏，』她隨着他謙敬的態度，而也閃了閃健美的腰，頭一點：『篷先生，我年紀輕，不懂事，請常常敎導！』</p>
<p>『楊惠敏？』多熟悉的名字啊！怕不就是潛進四行倉庫獻旗的女英雄楊憲敏嗎？我稍稍凝思地怔了怔，馬上思想答覆了我，擺在我眼前英偉姿態的她啓示了我。『是她；是她，她確是冒險獻旗的愛國女兒。』我立刻拋了筆，眼睛流了敬欽的光，身子跳起來：『這位就是戲旗的惠　小姐！』</p>
<p>『獻旗值不得榮耀，』她抿着嘴嫣笑：『我希望自已更能够多替危難的國家做一點實際有益的工作。現在國難臨到每個人民的頭上，每個人民就應該爲國效命，爲國捨身，不管是男的女的，都該負起一份國民　敵的責任。』</p>
<p>她底勇　態度，雄壯　辭，使我深致無限敬意，無限崇仰！</p>
<p>後來日子久了，我和她混得很熟了，我對她底一切，都熟知無遺。她底性格，是跟前錢的壯士一般。她底思想，跟時代女兒一樣。她底舉動，跟男性相似。她談吐時，聲音脆壯。她步行時，姿態健捷。她底臉雖然不十分美麗，（她廢除了脂粉的打扮，）却也非常動人。她底衣着，雖是一襲黃色制服，但極整潔，樸素。不過，她底頭髮，倒是電　過了的，鬆曲地；跑起路來，益增她底輕捷，活壯。</p>
<p>上海的環境日非了，當時當地的現狀，不容她執行勇敢的使命了，她不得不棄離上海，吿別她的友好，含着淚，忍着難過，高飛遠走地跑到後方去了。</p>
<p>臨行，她一點沒有悲哀的臉色，依然跳躍地跑到我底面前：『篷先生，我走了！』一本紀念册子從她底纖手送上桌子：『給我寫幾行，讓我到了內地留個紀念吧！』</p>
<p>『我寫不來，請原諒！』我想這樣說，可是我沒有說；我不能這樣對她。一個我深爲心折的女勇士將和我分離了，我怎能不給她一個最起碼的紀念呢！於是；我毫不思索地點點頭計：『好啊！你是要走的人了，我給你寫。」</p>
<p>「篷先生，我走啦！』强忍的她竟也帶着悲顫的情昧了，聲音裏溢滿了悲戚：『我到了那兒，就會有信來給你的，你別惦念我。」</p>
<p>我沒有送行，祗在門口和她緊密地握了一下手，也沒有說句頌語，默默地；默默地把感情的眼光凝停地注視着她底哀愁的臉頰，等她走遠去了，等我發覺自已身邊空廠地沒有了她底存在，我凝住了的傷感，很快地散裂開來；散在我的心頭，心一酸，臉顋不由地被雙行熟淚滾濕了。</p>
<p>如今八年了，我一直沒有得到她底音信，雖從友人方面獲悉她曾到過美國去，她在美國盡渦挺大挺有意義的使命，遠在上海的故人，確獲甚深的慰藉，然而終不若握手談歡的情景來得令人高興啊！</p>
<p>我願她早日回來，早日和我促膝長談，以慰殷念之情。</p>

<h3>周德卿女士主持的　學生經濟食堂</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>取價低廉，並具相當營養　難以爲繼，希望各界捐助</p>
<p>學生們和一般上公事房辦公的職業界，中膳實在是一個很嚴重的問題。四五年來，四川路靑年會一直辦着一所學生經濟食堂，是由周德卿女士負責主持的。周女士早年畢業於美國華律士大學，專攻家政學，對於烹飪和營養，有特殊的研究。</p>
<p>那一所食堂的創辦，是因爲美國學生救濟會捐助了一萬五千槐錢，於是就由男女青年會合辦一所學生經濟食堂，英文名字就呌Students　Relief　Economic　Restaurant。在開始的時候，就請周女士來負責主持。成立於三十年九月十日。</p>
<p>筆者在一二年前，曾到那裏去嚐試過一次午餐，但因爲是招待的關係，和每天供應的飯菜不同。在那食堂裏所供應的飯菜，雖則代價低得令人難於置信，但完全顧到營養的成分，曾請營養專家侯祥川博士加以規劃。</p>
<p>工作的方式是最合於民主的，每一個人要到那裏去吃一次飯，祇要買一張票，憑票換取飯菜和碗筷，吃完以後，碗筷自已去歸還，所以非常迅速簡便。自從開始到卅四年十二月卅一日爲止，總共洪應的客數是五十萬客。</p>
<p>目前所取的代價，十分低廉，計分二十元和四十元兩種。費了二十塊錢，可以吃到二碗赤豆飯和一碗菜湯（菜和湯的混合）在外面至少要費一百塊錢；費了四十塊錢，可以吃到二碗白飯和一菜一湯，在外面至少要費一百八十塊錢。</p>
<p>那一所食堂，自從開始的時候所得到的一萬五千元外，並沒有向外界作任何勸募，靠着那一筆的款在運用，自從開始到目前，曾經經過幾次物價高漲的風浪，維持的困難就可想而知。</p>
<p>像這樣一所眞能爲社會服務的經濟食堂，誰都會表示同情。到了目前，實在是需要各界給予襄助了，因爲那一所食堂僅有的一點存貨，已經賠貼盡凈了。所以很希望各界能够捐助一點麵粉·米·糖·或煤，最好能有牛奶，那末使那食堂可以繼續以低廉的代價，供應靑年人以適當的營養。</p>
<p>這幾天，正在從事修理爐灶，預備在二月十八日起照常供應。</p>

<h3>Chairman Will Soon Leave Shanghai for Nanjing to Attend Military Demobilization Conference; Cordial and Free Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The arrival of Chairman Chiang and his wife in Shanghai was met with wild jubilation by the entire city's residents. Yesterday, stores and households throughout the city continued to display flags to show their welcome and admiration. The consecutive days of clear weather and warm sunshine further symbolized the enthusiastic and excited emotions of the Shanghai citizens in welcoming their head of state. People from all walks of life, after eight years of separation, were eager to see the Chairman's demeanor and receive his instructions. In particular, both Chinese and foreign journalists flocked to the Chairman's private residence on Dongping Road, seeking interviews in an endless stream. Due to their busy official duties, the Chairman and his wife were unable to meet with everyone individually. Therefore, they made time at 11:00 AM yesterday to hold their first press conference in Shanghai since the War of Resistance. The Shanghai Office of the Central Propaganda Department invited reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city to attend. Before 10:30 AM, the seating in the Shanghai Municipal Government conference room was already full, with about seventy people, all waiting excitedly and pleasantly for the arrival of the Chairman and his wife.</p>
<p>At 11:05 AM, the Chairman and his wife, accompanied by Chairman Zhang Daofan and Mayor Qian Dajun, gracefully arrived, and the entire room stood up to pay their respects. Chinese and foreign photographers busily captured these invaluable moments of the Chairman and his wife. The Chairman wore a special-grade general's uniform of khaki wool, looking radiant and kind. Madame Chiang wore a purple silk cheongsam with a chestnut-colored velvet coat, her face full of smiles, approachable and amiable. After the Chairman took his seat, he repeatedly nodded and smiled, inviting everyone to sit down, and the press conference began. First, Chairman Zhang Daofan stood up and announced: "Today, as the Chairman still has other important matters to attend to, the press conference is limited to twenty minutes. If you have any questions, please complete them within twenty minutes. To help the Chairman and Madame Chiang get to know everyone, please state your name and the name of the newspaper you represent before asking your questions."</p>
<p>The Chairman then declared, "If you have any opinions, please feel free to ask." After Secretary Shen Changhuan translated into English, Chinese and foreign reporters freely raised various questions, and the Chairman personally answered them one by one. For those that could not be answered in detail on the spot, he indicated, "Please submit written inquiries, so that I can provide written replies." Madame Chiang also interjected from the side, helping to convey messages. For example, when a foreign reporter asked about "rumors that China and the Soviet Union are conducting secret negotiations," mistakenly saying "rumors that the United States and the Soviet Union," Madame Chiang immediately corrected him. Also, when the Chairman answered a reporter's question about the date of returning the capital, saying "The government's return to the capital will be before May, but it has not yet been decided," Secretary Shen omitted "before May" when translating into English, and Madame Chiang immediately corrected him. Secretary Shen then apologized.</p>
<p>The Chairman answered a total of fifteen questions. More questions were raised by foreign reporters, and the content included domestic affairs, diplomacy, economics, and other aspects. The atmosphere in the venue was very free and harmonious, without any restraint, fully demonstrating the Chairman's utmost respect for public opinion and freedom. When the press conference had already exceeded the time by five minutes, Secretary Shen announced its conclusion, but the Chairman still smilingly declared, "It is okay to extend it for a few more minutes, please continue to raise one or two more questions," which proved that the Chairman was very happy to talk with reporters and listen to the opinions of the press. The press conference concluded at 11:35 AM, lasting a total of thirty minutes. After the meeting, at the request of a foreign female reporter, the Chairman stood side by side with her for a photo before leaving the venue with his wife. The original words of the Chairman's answers to the reporters' questions are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Answers to Various Important Questions</h3>
<p>Reporter (1): It is rumored that China and the Soviet Union are conducting secret negotiations. It is said that the United States government is requesting China and the Soviet Union to fully inform the United States government of the negotiation situation. Is there such a thing?</p>
<p>Chairman's Answer: Regarding this matter, I have already explained it to reporters in Chongqing. There are no formal negotiations between China and the Soviet Union at present. However, informal discussions on economic cooperation are ongoing from time to time, but there is nothing that cannot be disclosed. If the United States government has this desire, then we can inform them at any time.</p>
<p>Question (2): By what date will the Soviet army completely withdraw from the nine northeastern provinces of China? What is the agreement between the Soviet Union and the Chinese government?</p>
<p>Answer: This matter has already been announced. The Soviet army originally intended to withdraw from the Northeast before February 1st. Regarding the detailed situation in the Northeast, there is no time to tell you in detail today. If you have any questions, you can submit them in writing, and I can give you a written reply in the future.</p>
<p>Question (3): Negotiations between China and France have been going on for a long time. I wonder if there are any difficulties in the progress, and when can a new treaty be signed?</p>
<p>Answer: Negotiations between China and France are still in progress, and the results will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Question (4): Last Sunday, Chongqing citizens celebrated the success of the Political Consultative Conference, and a fight broke out. I wonder who should be responsible?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not received a report on this matter yet.</p>
<p>Question (5): Since the Chairman's arrival in Shanghai, prices here have fallen sharply, indicating that there is speculation by unscrupulous merchants. I wonder if the government can take effective steps to deal with prices in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: The government will naturally take effective measures to deal with prices.</p>
<p>Question (6): How much time will it take for General Marshall to complete his mission in China?</p>
<p>Answer: It will take a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>Question (7): When will the National Assembly be held, when will the government return to the capital, and is there any plan to move the capital elsewhere?</p>
<p>Answer: The government has decided that the National Assembly will be held in Nanjing on May 5th, so the government's return to the capital will be before May, but it has not yet been decided. As for the relocation of the capital, there is no such saying in the government.</p>
<p>Question (8): Will the Chairman go to Nanjing to attend the military demobilization conference convened by the Army Headquarters in Nanjing?</p>
<p>Answer: I will go to Nanjing to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Question (9): The government has made major concessions in the Political Consultative Conference. Does the CCP guarantee that it can truly abandon its private army?</p>
<p>Answer: I and the people of the whole country believe that the Chinese Communist Party's private army will certainly be returned to the state, because if the CCP cannot abandon its private army, then all the efforts of this Political Consultative Conference will be invalid, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference will be equivalent to empty words.</p>
<p>Question (10): It is said that there are still some German Nazis in China who have not been sent to concentration camps. I wonder if the Chairman paid attention to this during his visit to Shanghai?</p>
<p>Answer: The government treats all German Nazis in China as prisoners of war and deals with them accordingly. However, genuine German businessmen who have no political ties should be treated differently.</p>
<p>Question (11): When can political prisoners be released?</p>
<p>Answer: The Political Consultative Conference has already made a resolution on the release of political prisoners, and the government has announced this a long time ago, and it is now being implemented.</p>
<p>Question (12): Chinese newspapers widely report that the government is about to be reorganized, and there are various speculations about the candidates for ministers of the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: The government reorganization will be implemented after the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, so all issues must be decided by the Second Plenary Session. All the rumors outside are speculation.</p>
<p>Question (13): Before the Chairman goes to Nanjing, will he return to his hometown of Fenghua for a trip?</p>
<p>Answer: I have no time for that at the moment.</p>
<p>Question (14): Is China preparing to try Japanese war criminals in China, and what are your opinions on the re-education of Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: China will also try Japanese war criminals in China in the same way as other countries, and it can be done at any time. Regarding the re-education of Japan, I generally agree with General MacArthur's approach.</p>
<p>Question (15): Will China send troops to participate in the occupation of Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: The government is considering this matter and will decide soon.</p>

<h3>Chairman and His Wife Host Elderly Gentry; Cordially Offer Comfort and Inquire About the Situation Over the Past Eight Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Chairman Chiang and his wife held a tea party at Talas Road at 4:00 PM yesterday, hosting elderly gentry from this city, including Yen Hui-ching, Zhang Shizhao, Chen Tingrui, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Wenyuan, Xu Bingkun, Wu Tegong, Hu Pu'an, Huang Shijin, Xu Jiqing, Yen Fuying, Lao Nianzhu, Ma Xulun, Chen Kuilong, Ye Jingkui, Zhang Yuanji, Liu Chongjie, Liu Yuan, Chen Leng, Li Denghui, He Bingsong, Chuan Tongxian, Lu Jizeng, Yuan Xiluo, Zha Renwei, Jiang Weiqiao, Chu Fengyi, Jin Tongyin, Ni Baochun, Dong Renjian, Sheng Zhenwei, Fan Zhengkang, Wu Baofeng, Feng Youzhen, Wei Bozhen, Jin Tingsun, Qin Runqing, Mrs. Huang Fu, Sun Wang Guoxiu, Yu Qingtang, Gao Junshan, Xu Langxi, Huang Jinrong, Yuan Liang, Hui Jiliang, Zhao Shiguang, Qian Tuanyun, Sheng Huaidi, Jin Renjian, Wang Zhonglin, and more than ten people from American churches. Zhang Guogan, Ye Gongchuo, Chen Taoyi, Zhao Zhiyou, Yan Huiyu, and Tang Wenzhi were unable to attend due to illness. Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived at 4:20 PM and were introduced to each attendee by Mayor Qian, Chairman Wu, and others, shaking hands with each person. The Chairman's attitude was kind, and his genuine emotions were fully revealed, offering sincere comfort to the attendees, showing utmost cordiality. Among them were many who were acquainted with the Chairman and his wife. The Chairman and his wife inquired about the situation over the past eight years with earnest concern, deeply moving all the attendees. They then took their seats, and after light refreshments, the Chairman stood up to deliver a speech, extending his sincere comfort to the elderly gentry and citizens of Shanghai. The entire room responded with warm applause. Next, Mr. Yen Hui-ching delivered a reply on behalf of the elderly gentry. Finally, Mr. Li Denghui firmly requested Madame Chiang to deliver a speech. As there were many American church members present, Madame Chiang spoke in English. Although her words were brief, her emotions were sincere, and everyone applauded repeatedly to express their gratitude. The tea party ended at around 5:00 PM, and the attendees once again shook hands with the Chairman and his wife to say goodbye. After a brief rest, the Chairman and his wife also departed. At that time, Talas Road was already packed with people, vying to catch a glimpse of the demeanor of the Chairman and his wife. When the Chairman and his wife left in a car, cheers thundered, as if everyone was drunk or in a dream. The speeches of Chairman Chiang and Yen Hui-ching are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>I have been separated from the elders and compatriots of Shanghai for more than eight years. During these eight years, the elders and compatriots of Shanghai have suffered from the oppression and trampling of the enemy and puppets, but they have all struggled hard and jointly strived for victory. Today, meeting here is like a family reunion, harmonious and happy. I am filled with emotions, and a wave of enthusiasm that cannot be expressed in words. Shanghai is our country's largest city and should be a model for the whole country. I hope that all the elders will carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and work together to build a new country, so as not to betray the results obtained from bearing hardships and enduring humiliation for eight years. I extend my sincere wishes, wish you all good health, and jointly complete the great cause of national construction.</p>
<p>Yen Hui-ching's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: Listening to the Chairman's instructions and comfort fully demonstrates his concern for the citizens of Shanghai, which is inspiring. I have been in Shanghai for four or five years, coming from Hong Kong via Chongqing, so I am more familiar with the situation in Shanghai and can briefly report to the Chairman. Recalling the beginning of the Japanese surrender, I, Hui-ching, was instructed by Mr. Jiang Bocheng to convey the Chairman's message to comfort the British and American僑民 in the concentration camps. At that time, I told them that the physical suffering in the concentration camps was not the real suffering. The most painful thing was the lack of opportunity to serve the motherland during the War of Resistance. The British and American僑民 were very moved by these words. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Shanghai was actually a large concentration camp. The physical suffering of the citizens of Shanghai was not worth mentioning, but their spirits were very painful because they could not work as hard for the War of Resistance as their compatriots in the interior. After the victory of the War of Resistance, many compatriots in the interior did not understand the difficult situation of the citizens of Shanghai, but among the three million citizens of Shanghai, although there were a few scum, the majority loved the country and could contribute money and effort to run charitable and educational undertakings. In recent months, compatriots in the interior have clearly understood the citizens of Shanghai. Everyone is of one heart and one mind, working together to promote the prosperity of Shanghai. In the past eight years, Shanghai's municipal administration has been abandoned, roads have not been repaired, sewers have not been unblocked, and wharves have been damaged, all of which need to be repaired urgently. However, a large amount of money is needed, which is beyond the capabilities of the Shanghai Municipal Government. I dare to ask the Chairman to pay special attention to it. Last time the Chairman went to Peiping but did not visit Shanghai, the citizens of Shanghai were all disappointed. Yesterday, the Chairman and his wife suddenly arrived, and the citizens of the whole city were overjoyed and enthusiastic, all from sincerity. This scene is like orphans seeing their parents. I only represent the elders of the city to pay respects to the Chairman and his wife.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: I am very happy to see many old friends during this trip to Shanghai with the Chairman. Just now, Mr. Yen said that the compatriots in the interior do not understand the situation of the citizens of Shanghai very well, which is not entirely true. I can tell you a story. Last month, I went to the Northeast. According to a friend, when the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, they forced the compatriots in the Northeast to pray for the Japanese Emperor every morning. The compatriots in the Northeast did pray, but not for the Japanese Emperor, but for the National Government. The Chairman and I are convinced that Shanghai is also the same. The citizens of Shanghai, except for a few scum, are all loyal to their country. As early as the War of Resistance, the compatriots in the interior struggled for the country with force, while the citizens of Shanghai promoted the national spirit and gave spiritual encouragement to the whole country. What I must express my gratitude for is that the citizens of Shanghai did their best to donate money during the War of Resistance, so that wounded soldiers, orphans, and the families of anti-Japanese soldiers could get financial assistance. Now that the War of Resistance has victoriously ended, the occupied areas and the free areas are like a large family, without distinction between each other. The so-called "within the four seas, all are brothers."</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Letters of Petition Received from the People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Chairman Chiang's first visit to Shanghai after the victory of the War of Resistance shows his great concern for the sufferings of the people. He has specially set up a secretariat in the headquarters to accept petitions from the people. It is reported that the secretariat received more than 180 letters yesterday, of which more than 120 were accusation letters. It is said that most of the accusation letters are accusations against traitors, and some also involve administrative officials.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Personally Receives Representatives of Comrades Who Suffered; Ten-Minute Speech Greatly Encourages</h3>
<p>[This City News] After the press conference, the Chairman went to the Secretary-General's office and, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief, received fifty representatives of comrades who suffered, including Mrs. Jiang Bocheng, Wu Kaixian, Dai Jimin, Tao Guangchuan, Fei Yimin, Jiang Menglin, Wang Weijun, Qian Jianqiu, Wan Molin, Lü Entan, Mao Zipei, Chen Baohua, Ji Zhenchang, Luo Yaxi, Zhu Wen, Wen Tiansheng, Lu Huimin, and Mrs. Zhang Xiaotong. He greatly encouraged the comrades for their hard struggle in the past eight years and hoped that they would continue their efforts in the future. After a ten-minute speech, he took a group photo with all the representatives of the comrades who suffered in front of the Municipal Government to commemorate the occasion. At the same time, the comrades who suffered presented the Commander-in-Chief with a written request for five items, including severely punishing traitors, establishing schools for the children of comrades who suffered, and providing relief to the families of martyred comrades. The Commander-in-Chief repeatedly said about the point of severely punishing traitors: "It should be, it should be."</p>
<h3>Chairman Visits U.S. Flagship Yesterday; Inspects Chinese Naval Vessels and Trained Soldiers; Beforehand, Appears on Municipal Government Balcony to Meet Welcoming Crowds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Yesterday morning, the Chairman summoned Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Jiangsu Inspector Cheng Cangbo at the official residence to hear reports on the general situation in the city. Mr. Cheng also reported on his inspection of Jiangsu Province, and they left after half an hour. At 11:00 AM, the Chairman and his wife attended a press conference at the Municipal Government and summoned representatives of the comrades who suffered. An hour earlier, thousands of people had gathered near the Municipal Government, vying to see the demeanor of the Chairman and Madame Chiang. When the car carrying the Chairman and his wife arrived at the gate of the Municipal Government at exactly 11:00 AM, the crowd cheered enthusiastically. Later, more and more crowds gathered, causing traffic congestion nearby. After receiving the representatives of the comrades who suffered, the Chairman, because of the people's unanimous request to see him and their unwavering gathering, unable to suppress their enthusiasm, accompanied his wife to the balcony on the upper floor of the main entrance of the Municipal Government, appearing before tens of thousands of people, waving to meet the crowds. At this time, tens of thousands of people unanimously cheered enthusiastically, and the cheers thundered, shaking the clouds, lasting for a long time. The reporter also walked onto the balcony at this time, looking down and seeing a sea of people in front of the Municipal Government, waving their hats and hands, expressing their highest respect to the Chairman and his wife. The sincerity of their emotions cannot be described in words. The Chairman and his wife also smiled and waved frequently in response, lasting for three minutes before coming down from the balcony. Because the crowds in front of the Municipal Government had not dispersed at this time, and vehicles could not pass, they drove away from the side door of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road. At 11:15 AM, at the invitation of Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy in China, the Chairman and his wife went to the U.S. Seventh Fleet flagship "Estes." When the Chairman and Madame Chiang arrived at the Jianghai Customs Wharf, the crowds waiting in front of and on the roof of the Customs Inspection Office shouted "Long Live!" and applauded enthusiastically. The Chairman slowly walked towards the river, waving frequently to the cheering crowds. Rear Admiral Ponner, Chief of Staff of the Seventh Fleet, was already waiting at the wharf to greet them. The Chairman and his wife boarded a small motorboat specially prepared for the reception and sailed to the flagship. The officers and men on the ship stood on the deck and saluted as the motorboat approached. When the boat approached the flagship, the Chairman and his wife were the first to board the ship, followed by General Wedemeyer, Mayor Qian, Director Yu, Director Dai, Director Zhou Zhirou, Deputy Director Zhou Xianzhang, and others. When the Chairman arrived on the deck, the ship played the Chinese national anthem to pay tribute. Then, Admiral Cooke, Commander of the Seventh Fleet, greeted them into the living room and served them refreshments, talking happily for fifteen minutes. Admiral Cooke then invited the Chairman and his wife to take a photo on the deck to leave a glorious souvenir for the ship. After leaving the ship, the motorboat carrying the Chairman circled around the ships of the fleet anchored in the Huangpu River. Each ship hung the Chinese national flag to pay tribute, and the officers and men stood on the deck to salute. The Chairman stood at the stern of the boat and returned the salute one by one, and his wife also smiled and waved frequently. The British warships in the river also hung our national flag, and the officers and men stood on the deck to salute. After landing, the Chairman and his entourage took a car to the Huishan Wharf to inspect the Chinese Navy landing craft and inspect the sailors who were being trained, encouraging them to take on the important task of rebuilding the Chinese Navy. At 4:00 PM, the Chairman and his wife attended the historic tea party for the provincial gentry of the city at Talas Road, which ended at 5:22 PM. The Chairman and his wife heard that Ye Chucang, Special Envoy for Comforting the Southeast Region and Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, was seriously ill and was receiving treatment at the Municipal Sanatorium on Daxilu Road. They were accompanied by Chairman Wu Shaoshu of the City Party Committee to visit and offer comfort. They then returned to the official residence at 5:40 PM. Today, the Chairman will come to the racecourse at 3:00 PM to receive a grand welcome from more than 100,000 people and deliver a speech to comfort the citizens of the city who have suffered hardships for the past eight years. At 5:30 PM, the Chairman and his wife will host a tea party for Argentine Ambassador to China Eck and his wife at the official residence.</p>

The Egyptian representative requested that formal steps be taken to prevent British troops from resisting the Indonesian national movement. If the negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia unfortunately fail, the Council retains the right to take other actions. The Egyptian proposal is a compromise measure that completely abandons the proposal to send a delegation. The Council adjourned until tonight at the request of Soviet representative Vyshinsky.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 13th] The New York Times correspondent stated that the famine in India is indeed a very serious problem at present, but even if all the wheat produced in the world were poured into Madras, Indians would still starve to death. Indian people only know rice as food, and do not know that meat is better than rice. There are no less than 170 million cattle and sheep in India, enjoying themselves without fear of slaughter. Indians would rather starve to death than eat beef. The various political parties in India are still unwilling to cooperate in dealing with this serious famine problem. The National Congress Party is willing to let the Indian government solve this problem, hoping that the food crisis can promote the establishment of a people's government. Although the Muslim League is willing to assist the current Indian government, it does not want to join the people's government. Internal conflicts are the fatal wound of India.</p>

<h3>New York Fuel Panic After Nine Days of Tugboat Workers' Strike; Industrial, Commercial, and Entertainment Venues Ordered to Close; World Metropolis Now Lifeless</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 12th] The New York tugboat workers' strike has been going on for nine days, and the situation is urgent due to the lack of fuel in winter. The mayor has taken strict measures. This world's third largest metropolis is lifeless today, an unprecedented phenomenon. Industrial, commercial, and entertainment venues are completely shut down, Broadway is dark, and shops and windows are closed. The city is unable to obtain coal or oil from the New Jersey train station due to the North River, so all industries, except those necessary to maintain operations, were ordered to shut down by the mayor one minute before midnight on Sunday, which is an unprecedented event in peacetime. Certain restaurants and public service agencies that are necessary to maintain the health and welfare of citizens are not subject to this shutdown order. According to the mayor, this order has had a direct effect and will continue indefinitely. However, the tugboat strike still has no hope of being resolved soon due to disputes over wages and working hours. The businesses that are currently closed include department stores, schools, libraries, museums, theaters, nightclubs, and various gathering places. Only public utilities, transportation, newspapers, nurseries, nursing homes, and hospitals are exempt from restrictions.</p>

<h3>Blood Stains Vietnam, Tears Sprinkle Siam! Overseas Chinese Became Living Targets; Professor Lian Qiuai, Returned From The South Seas, Relates Horrifying Events</h3>
<p>In various parts of the South Seas after the victory, there are recurring events of anti-Chinese sentiment, from personal insults to group losses of life and property. We cannot help but wonder, did the motherland not achieve victory in this war? Why is it that our British and French allies, standing on the same victory line, have a subtle and tortuous attitude towards these unending anti-Chinese incidents?</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, our reporter had the accidental opportunity to have a long conversation with Professor Lian Qiuai, who had just flown in from the South Seas. Here are the contents of the conversation.</p>
<h3>法越衝突　華僑處境困難</h3>
<p>The Difficult Situation of Overseas Chinese Amidst the Franco-Vietnamese Conflict</p>
<p>Professor Shu taught in Beiping in the past. After the July 7th Incident, he moved to Hong Kong, teaching economic history at Lingnan University. When the Pacific War broke out, he crossed the sea to Vietnam, changed his name, and lived in seclusion in the countryside more than 200 miles from Saigon. He spent four years of hardship teaching and translating. After Japan surrendered, he went to Saigon and witnessed the suffering of the overseas Chinese in their real lives. He repeatedly represented them in negotiations with the local authorities. Later, he went to Bangkok and saw the situation of the overseas Chinese in Siam. His words were full of blood and tears, and his tone was filled with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>He said that the official Franco-Vietnamese conflict began on September 23rd of last year. Most of the overseas Chinese in Saigon lived in the Xidi area. After the direct conflict began, the damage in Xidi was quite severe. In early October, the British authorities intervened to mediate. Afterward, batches of French soldiers arrived one after another, and the negotiations failed. From then on, the French shot Vietnamese when they saw them, and the Vietnamese also killed French when they saw them. The situation of the overseas Chinese was quite difficult. The Vietnamese demanded that the overseas Chinese close their shops, and after the overseas Chinese agreed, the French blamed them. In mid-October, misfortune finally befell the overseas Chinese in Saigon. At that time, a batch of British-Indian troops arrived and carried out rape and pillage. I was chosen as a representative to negotiate with the British authorities. The British authorities initially denied it, but later said they wanted evidence. When evidence was presented, there was no concrete solution.</p>
<p>At this point, Lian Guangsheng gave an example.</p>
<h3>西堤華女　橫遭輪姦悲劇</h3>
<p>The Tragedy of an Overseas Chinese Woman in Xidi Violently Gang-raped</p>
<p>He said that one night, in an overseas Chinese concentrated area in Xidi, Vietnam, several British-Indian soldiers suddenly broke in and began to gang-rape an overseas Chinese woman. Her husband went out to call for help, and by chance, an Annamite (Vietnamese) passed by and ran in, shooting and killing one of the British-Indian soldiers. The others rushed back to their unit to report, and a squad of soldiers was immediately sent. They insisted that there were Viet Minh in the area, so they set fire to hundreds of houses. While the houses were burning, they forbade anyone from rescuing them. The displaced refugees in the disaster area, with no homes to return to, gathered at the local overseas Chinese organization, the Seven Prefectures Association. Although representatives were sent to negotiate, nothing came of it.</p>
<p>Soon, the French arrived at the embankment (Xidi) to suppress the Viet Minh party members. Viet Minh members retaliated by throwing hand grenades. The French opened fire with heavy machine guns, turning the overseas Chinese area into a living target! Naturally, there was another round of deaths, injuries, and losses!</p>
<p>In December, the French looting intensified. On the evening of the 25th, French soldiers, filling three trucks, arrived at the overseas Chinese area. Ostensibly, they were searching for Viet Minh members, but in reality, they searched house by house, robbing and looting. If they saw a woman, they raped and insulted her. If they saw a man, they beat and scolded him. If they saw money or jewelry, they pocketed it. They even stole a piece of bread left on the table. Throughout the long, dark night, a curfew was strictly enforced everywhere. The overseas Chinese could not take a single step beyond the permitted area. They had no way to call for help. They could only let the French soldiers take whatever they wanted, without any resistance. The next day, the overseas Chinese representatives negotiated with the French authorities, but the French authorities, as always, demanded evidence, and the matter ended inconclusively.</p>
<p>As a result of such plunder, an average of ten overseas Chinese died every day, and the daily loss of property reached one million Vietnamese dollars (one Vietnamese dollar is approximately equal to fifty Chinese legal tender yuan). For months, business has been unable to resume, and the indirect intangible losses are countless!</p>
<p>Economically speaking, the overseas Chinese in Vietnam were also being squeezed out everywhere. On November 18th of last year, the French authorities issued an order declaring all 500-yuan banknotes issued by the French-owned Banque de l'Indochine invalid.</p>
<h3>鈔券作廢　五百元等於零</h3>
<p>Banknotes Declared Invalid: 500 Yuan Equals Zero</p>
<p>Eighty percent of these banknotes are now in the hands of the overseas Chinese, especially those engaged in small businesses, who exchanged their money for large denomination banknotes for convenience when taking out their funds during air raids. With the issuance of this invalidation order, the overseas Chinese small people suffered a fatal blow, and the overseas Chinese property was declared bankrupt! As a result of the negotiations, the French authorities finally agreed to redeem the 500-yuan banknotes issued by the bank during the French colonial period at 70% of their face value. However, they fundamentally refused to recognize those issued during the Japanese occupation. A French newspaper "Justice" was closed by the French authorities for criticizing the "500 yuan equals zero" measure.</p>
<h3>暹京排華　交涉竟無下文</h3>
<p>Anti-Chinese Sentiment in Siam: Negotiations Lead to No Resolution</p>
<p>At this point, our conversation shifted to the recent anti-Chinese incidents in Siam. Mr. Lian had just flown from Siam to Manila, and he knew the inside story of this incident very well. He spoke at length, first mentioning the Siamese national character, which is full of inferiority complex. The characteristic of inferiority complex is that on the one hand, it wants to be a vassal state of a major power, and on the other hand, it wants to use the power of a major power to oppress other countries. In the past, there were ten slogans circulating in Siam, saying: "It is better to be a cow or a horse for the British than to be friends with the overseas Chinese." During the Japanese occupation, the Siamese went to the extreme in oppressing the overseas Chinese, and shamelessly said: "In the Far East, Japan is number one, and Siam is number two!" Killing one or two overseas Chinese is not a big deal. If you sue in court, the Siamese always win, and the overseas Chinese always go to jail!</p>
<p>This time, when the news of the motherland's final victory reached Siam, the overseas Chinese, who had endured years of silence, hung up the national flag everywhere, regardless of everything. The Siamese interfered, insisting that only the Siamese flag could be hung to celebrate the victory, and a conflict broke out. Although the overseas Chinese were unarmed, their morale was very high, but they suffered a massacre by the local military and police. Afterward, the overseas Chinese representatives negotiated with the authorities, but there was no follow-up, and the situation continued to escalate.</p>
<p>Although Siam is a small country, its diplomatic skills are quite high. On January 4th of this year, Mr. Xing Senzhou, a special envoy from the Central Overseas Department, arrived in Bangkok, and the Siamese government sent a special car to welcome him. On January 9th, Mr. Li Tiezheng and his party of eight, members of the Chinese delegation to Siam, also arrived in Bangkok. The Siamese government's hospitality was quite enthusiastic. On January 24th, Special Envoy Xing visited and inspected Wanbang without any accidents. However, on January 27th, when Director Li and his party went to the countryside to visit, unfortunately, there was trouble, and many overseas Chinese were killed and injured. Afterward, Director Li lodged a serious protest with the Siamese government. The Siamese government promised to be responsible for investigating the losses, but again there was no follow-up.</p>
<p>As for the draft Sino-Siamese treaty, although it has been signed recently, the Siamese insist on two points: (1) Nationality issue: According to Siamese law, all overseas Chinese born in Siam are considered Siamese. If this law cannot be amended, then many overseas Chinese will only be adding to the population and wealth of the Siamese. (2) Overseas Chinese education: As a result of the delegation's forceful argument, the Siamese government only allowed the stipulation that one-third of the school curriculum should be taught in Chinese, and the rest of the time should be taught purely in Siamese. This has a very serious impact on the national education of the overseas Chinese!</p>
<p>The poison of fascism is still deep. True friendship will require at least ten years, and the first condition is to see the motherland establish its external strength. The overseas Chinese have realized that only the unity and prosperity of the motherland can restore their lost status overseas and achieve the motherland's overall and ultimate victory!

<h3>投機漲價誰負其責？</h3>
<p>Who is Responsible for Speculation and Rising Prices?</p>
<p>On the day the Chairman arrived in Shanghai, the price of gold and US dollars suddenly plunged after rising. People were fortunate that these speculators might be aware of the need to restrain themselves and ease up a bit, so that the common people could catch their breath amidst the rising prices. Who knew that in the past two days, they reverted to their old ways, raising the price of gold to 14,000 yuan and the price of US dollars to 2,000 yuan, which caused general prices to skyrocket as well. People generally want to exchange legal tender for goods, but those who live on salaries may suffocate and die in the fierce flames of speculation and hoarding! This is the most pressing and painful issue for Shanghai citizens today.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been the number one city in the country. Today, the speculative capital and habitual speculation in Shanghai will inevitably lead the major cities throughout the country to follow suit and compete with each other. Therefore, Chongqing and Kunming during the war are like a small witch seeing a great witch compared to today's Shanghai. Therefore, the skyrocketing gold prices and soaring commodity prices in Shanghai today will inevitably cause gold prices and commodity prices to rise in the north and south, and the livelihoods of ordinary people across the country will feel tremendous pressure. It can be seen that the recent unusual agitation in the Shanghai market is not only considered the most important issue by the citizens of Shanghai, but also a top priority for the people of the whole country!</p>
<p>But even though the situation is urgent and the problem is like a rampant flood, how many people are truly worried and eager to put out the flames and save the tide? Apart from Chairman Jiang's concern for the people's suffering and his repeated orders to the chief officials to find ways to curb it, we have not seen the responsible authorities come up with any concrete measures to this day. What is valuable in a government is to face reality, to have the spirit of taking care of the people as if they were one's own children, and to relieve the suffering of the majority of the people. What is valuable in a politician is to have foresight and decisiveness, to do what should be done, without hesitation. The most incomprehensible question we have today is that the illegal speculative behavior in the Shanghai market has never stopped since the victory, five or six months ago. Why has the authorities turned a blind eye? Whether the government's gold policy is going to change or not, whether the new exchange rate is going to be fixed or not, they say this today and spread that tomorrow, allowing the speculators in the market to spread rumors, while the responsible officials turn a deaf ear. They even fabricate telegrams to stir up trouble, saying that "Sun" notes are going to be issued from Nanjing, or that the city celebration will set the US exchange rate at 2,000 yuan from Hong Kong. Even the Hong Kong authorities can't help but investigate, but the chief officials in Shanghai, the capital of the Republic, are calmly acting as if nothing is happening. The most ridiculous thing is that they are using the national bonds issued by the state as chips for their speculative gambling, speculating that "Sun" notes will be used to repay the principal and interest, and using this as an excuse to raise prices, while the chief officials remain silent. In short, the Shanghai market as a whole has lost its way, galloping wildly and rampaging, and in six months, we have not seen the responsible authorities take any action. Are they incompetent? Or are they deliberately ignoring it?</p>
<p>Leaving aside speculative trading, let's examine the rise in general prices. The main reasons are the expansion of currency and the lack of materials. But we should not forget that prices once fell universally at the beginning of the victory. And why have they risen four or five times in five or six months? Even in the recovered areas, the enemy and puppet factories and materials received by the government, all industries, cannot be said to be small. Except for the Northeast, which still has special obstacles, can the various places make full use of these materials to stabilize prices? The Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau has a number of items that are said to be sold at low prices, but they are mostly handled in batches and sold at 20% off. As a result, when the market price rises, the low price also rises, and when the low price rises, the market price rises again, in a cyclical manner. What effect is achieved! Even more strangely, the China Weaving and Construction Company sold yarn and cloth, and raised prices first. As the official price of yarn and cloth rose, the market followed suit. Those with such a narrow vision, who think that it is a good idea to earn more money for the public on yarn and cloth, do not know that the increase in prices stimulates the rise of general prices. Not to mention the increased suffering of the common people, the increase in all government expenditures will be thousands of times greater than this number. By extension, after the factories are taken over, they are either investigated, returned, or evaluated and auctioned, with layers of procedures and restrictions, with agencies competing for power, and the government and the people competing for profits. Documents are exchanged, and debates are endless, and most of the factories remain closed, and the leakage and waste of materials continues as before. Since it is clear that there are already few materials, they are willing to listen to the factories not making the best use of them. Since it is clear that there are not many factories in China, they do not make intensive efforts to promote the start of work in the factories. They do not have a large amount of capital and full momentum to nationalize them all decisively, but they are unwilling to let go and let everyone quickly privatize them. Whether it is nationalized or privatized, the people only hope to start work and production as soon as possible to increase materials, but today the road to this goal is still very long. Everyone sees that the factories are not opening their doors, and the materials are gradually being used up, coupled with the rapid wind of speculation, and naturally tend to buy goods quickly. Then, who should be responsible for the rising prices caused by this psychology? It is not difficult to "think more than half."</p>
<p>Speaking of the currency issue, we cannot deny that it is already in the process of expansion, and the vicious expansion should be stopped. If the financial authorities have policies and are responsible, they should have come up with concrete and effective measures long ago. If we do not quickly tighten the currency and stabilize the value of the currency, the country's economic future will have infinite disasters! And there are many ways to stabilize and tighten, but the main thing is the four words "internal first, external second." An economist once advocated that the purchasing power of legal currency should first be stabilized and then increased domestically, and then the exchange rate can be reset. Regardless of whether the new exchange rate should be high or low, and whether the timing of resetting the exchange rate should be early or late, if legal currency is allowed to depreciate in the eyes of the general public for a long time, and they look down on legal currency and only value goods, then the financial authorities will be at fault, and the entire government will suffer greatly. To stabilize the value of the currency, we must tighten the currency. To tighten the currency, we must increase revenue and reduce expenditure. This is a cliché, but it is still an immutable truth. We want to ask: What expenditure has the government reduced in the past few months? What revenue has it increased? We only hear about meetings being held today and matters being discussed tomorrow, an office being set up today and an association being set up tomorrow. We also hear that the government is about to be reorganized, the number of commissioners is to be increased, and the number of government offices is to be increased. This party is divided into several departments, and that faction occupies several positions. The number of agencies is numerous, and they are stacked on top of each other. Despite the fact that civil servants are said to be poor, the number of civil servants is increasing. On the surface, they say they are downsizing the army and reducing the staff, but in some places, the armed forces are recruiting militiamen and expanding their strength in order to be downsized first. In this way, there are many officials, many staff, many generals, and many soldiers. How can expenditures be saved? As for increasing revenue, has there been an increase in new taxes? Have we stopped embezzlement? Have we, in addition to printing more banknotes, considered raising public bonds and using frozen foreign exchange? Have we paid attention to subsidizing industrial and commercial enterprises, fostering the people's strength, and increasing the source of taxes? The authorities must understand the principle that to eat eggs, we cannot kill the chicken. Have the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy worked together to actively implement effective measures to support the development of national industry and international trade? If we continue to ask questions by drawing silk from cocoons, the reason why revenue cannot be increased quickly and expenditure cannot be reduced quickly is the main reason why the currency cannot be tightened. If the currency is not tightened, the value of the currency will not be stable. From this, who is responsible for the soaring prices can be understood without further explanation.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn criticize the virtuous. Although we know that speculation and manipulation are common crimes, and hoarding and cornering the market are prohibited by law, we cannot remain silent about the responsible officials turning a blind eye, being complacent, and bearing the chairman's earnest supervision and the people's expectations. For the sake of the country and the people's livelihood, we cannot remain silent.</p>

<h3>請撥市區敵產收入　充復興本市經費　市政諮議會昨日通過　將呈請中央予以照准</h3>
<p>Request to Allocate Revenue from Enemy Property in the City to Fund the Rejuvenation of the City: Municipal Advisory Council Passed Yesterday, Will Submit Request to the Central Government for Approval</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Council passed the proposal of Commissioner Pan Xulun at the meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. The recommendations are as follows:</p>
<p>Numerous Tasks Await, Limited by Financial Resources</p>
<p>"Since the recovery of the city, numerous tasks await us, and the revitalization and reconstruction are urgent. Whether it is the dredging of the Huangpu River, the repair of wharves, the improvement of roads and bridges, or public health, all require huge sums of money. However, the city's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and the monthly deficit is very large. After several discussions, the authorities felt that there was no way to make up for it. Since revenue and expenditure cannot be offset, let alone revitalize and reconstruct. Considering that the government has obtained a great deal of income from the handling of enemy and puppet property, it is proposed to request the central government to allocate a portion of the income from the handling of enemy and puppet property within the Shanghai urban area to the local revitalization and reconstruction funds of the city.</p>
<p>Reconstruction is Urgent</p>
<p>The reasons are divided into five points: (1) According to the principles of finance, if the central tax source comes from the local area, the right to collect taxes belongs to the central government, but a portion of the tax revenue is still allocated to the local area for use. The enemy and puppet property in the Shanghai urban area also has a local nature, and it should also be allocated to a portion for local revitalization and reconstruction in accordance with the principles of taxation. (2) All the original public buildings in the city have been in disrepair for many years or have even been damaged due to the war. Now that the War of Resistance Against Japan has been won, revitalization and reconstruction should be the top priority. It is extremely logical to use a portion of the income from the victory to repair the damage caused by the war. (3) Shanghai is the largest city in China, and the revitalization and prosperity of Shanghai will affect the entire country. For example, dredging the Huangpu River and building wharves are all related to the revitalization and reconstruction of our country. Shanghai can be said to be a city with both local and national characteristics, and its revitalization and reconstruction are even more urgent.</p>
<p>Extremely Fair to Use in This City</p>
<p>(4) Although the enemy and puppet property in Shanghai comes from all over the country, Shanghai has suffered the greatest threat of war and the greatest risk of destruction. Therefore, it is fair to use the income from the handling of enemy and puppet property for this city. (5) It was previously reported that when Chairman Jiang was in Beiping, he expressed to representatives from all walks of life that he could allocate a portion of the income from the handling of enemy and puppet property in the area for local revitalization and reconstruction. The three seats clearly understood everything and did not forget to give favors. This time, when he comes to this city, he must have the same virtues.</p>
<p>It is reported that this proposal will be initiated by the Municipal Advisory Council and jointly submitted by the city's public organizations to the municipal government and then to the central government for approval.</p>
<h3>本市道路僑梁　積極整修</h3>
<p>Active Repair of Roads and Bridges in This City</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Many of the city's roads were damaged during the eight years of enemy and puppet rule. According to statistics from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, a total of 340,000 square meters of road surface should be repaired. The bureau has now completed more than 150,000 square meters, accounting for 45% of the total number to be repaired. The main ones are Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Xizang North Road, Nan Road, Linsen West Road, and Qiujiang Wharf. Regarding the repair of bridges in the city, the bureau's statistics show that more than 70% of the 200 bridges in the city should be repaired. The main bridges currently under repair include Caojiadu Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, and Huangxing Road Bridge, all of which will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Widen Roads, Construct Sequentially</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works has formulated a comprehensive improvement plan for all roads in Shanghai. The first phase of the project is the gradual improvement of each road. It is learned that the road improvement projects of the bureau are as follows: (1) The road surface on Nanjing West Road, north of the Racecourse, will be widened to 20 meters, with 328 meters of open ditches filled and drainage pipes installed. The entire project commenced on January 8 of this year and is expected to be completed in early March. (2) Tianmu Road is the main thoroughfare from the North Railway Station to the city center. It has been planned to widen it to 25 meters, with sidewalks to 35 meters wide, a median platform, and fast and slow lanes on both sides. Construction will begin in early March and is expected to be completed by the end of June. (3) Zhenning Road, which runs north and south from Fanhongdu Road through Yuyuan Road, Xuanhua Road to Zhongzheng West Road, will begin construction in mid-March and is expected to be completed in late June. (4) At the intersection of Xujiahui Road, Xizang South Road, Zhizaoju Road, Fangxie Road, and Lujiabang Road, a small garden roundabout will be set up. Construction will begin in mid-March and is expected to be completed by the end of March.</p>
<h3>本市整編保甲完竣　計七十萬餘戶</h3>
<p>Reorganization of Baojia in This City Completed: Totaling Over 700,000 Households</p>
<p>The reorganization of the Baojia in this city, which began on January 15 and ended at the end of January, has been completely completed. According to the announcement of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, the city is divided into 29 districts, 1,030 Bao, 23,300 Jia, and 700,530 households. However, the unreceived areas are excluded, and the Baojia of boat households on the water are currently being planned and organized, and are not included in the above-mentioned Baojia household numbers. As for the city's population, gender, education level, and occupation, it will be necessary to wait until the household registration is completed on the 16th, and the total statistics can be published in early March.</p>
<h3>電力工潮圓滿解決　勞資雙方昨簽字　吳開先希望雙方合作</h3>
<p>Electricity Workers' Strike Resolved Successfully: Labor and Management Signed Yesterday, Wu Kaixian Hopes for Cooperation Between Both Sides</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the Shanghai Electric Power Company reached an agreement between the two parties on the 12th, and yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., representatives of labor and management continued to go to the Bureau of Social Affairs, where Director Wu Kaixian personally attended and presided over the meeting. First, Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan read the agreement record of the 12th three times in accordance with legislative procedures. Ferris, the plenipotentiary representative of the employer, and Ou Changzurun, Huang Hongxun, and Wu Shishen, the representatives of the workers, all signed the Labor Dispute Mediation Record No. 160 of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. Director Wu Kaixian, Representative Li Kaidi, Representative Zhou Lianze, and Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan all signed the mediation record. Director Wu also delivered a speech hoping for cooperation between both sides.</p>
<h3>The Cantonese Cuisine Industry Can Resume Business Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The labor strike in the Cantonese cuisine industry, unresolved for half a month, will end as labor and management agree to resume business today according to the mediation decision from the Social Affairs Bureau. However, the management of the "Four Sisters Café" believes it is not part of the Cantonese cuisine industry and therefore disagrees with the distribution of small accounts as stipulated in the mediation decision. The Social Affairs Bureau will summon the café's manager this morning to persuade them.</p>
<h3>Authorities Suppress Rice Prices by Releasing Large Quantities of Rice</h3>
<p>Since the Lunar New Year, rice prices in the city have fluctuated with commodity prices, soaring upwards, with the most intense price increases occurring last weekend. In order to regulate the food supply for the people and stabilize rice prices, the grain administration authorities have taken effective measures to suppress rice prices by releasing a large quantity of low-quality indica rice, totaling over 10,000 stones in the past two days. The prices are all about 2,000 yuan per stone lower than the market price, and the market trend has turned downwards. At the same time, the grain merchants are also taken into consideration, striving to stabilize prices reasonably, avoid drastic rises and falls, affect supply sources, and support transportation by giving priority convenience, as well as granting loans to rice merchants for maximum procurement. Shanghai has a current population of over 4 million, and excluding those who consume flour and miscellaneous grains, the average daily rice consumption is 600,000 to 700,000 stones. The source is mostly from the Su, Chang, Kun, Xi, and Wuhu areas. Although the number is staggering, last year's harvest was abundant, and according to precise investigations, only about 30% of the production area has been sold to date. In the past, the enemy controlled and seized supplies, but at this time, the grain reserves in various places are already less than half. Before the victory, there were only 200 rice merchants in the city, but now there are as many as 1,600 or 1,700, which shows their activity. It is also learned that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will soon ship 200,000 tons (equivalent to 275 dan) of rice to Shanghai from overseas. If unscrupulous individuals who take the opportunity to spread rumors and raise market prices, and speculation for purchasing national collections can be effectively eliminated, then the future of rice prices can be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Bunkers and Iron Fences Completely Removed</h3>
<p>During the Japanese occupation of the city, important roads were built with bunkers and iron fences. After the liberation, the Public Works Bureau considered these obstacles to have a significant impact on traffic on roads and in the suburbs. They immediately ordered the demolition, and the 36 iron gates at the junction of the French Concession in the Nanshi district have been completely removed. All bunkers in various districts have also been completely removed.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Forced Occupation of Land Will Be Investigated and Returned</h3>
<p>During the enemy and puppet regime in the city, many real estate properties were forcibly requisitioned. The Municipal Land Administration Bureau is mindful of the citizens who own real estate and have been ravaged for eight years, and in accordance with the "Measures for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas" formulated and promulgated by the Executive Yuan, it has formulated the "Shanghai Land Rights Clearing Measures" to clear them. It is heard that all land forcibly occupied or requisitioned by the enemy and puppets must be investigated and returned. If government agencies or troops are still using it, the protection of the owner's property rights should be the priority. The actual need should be considered and requisition procedures should be handled by the government according to the law. The bureau has accepted the request from citizens Zhu ChunGui and others to return the 36.36 mu of land forcibly requisitioned in the Yinxiang district. After summoning and verifying the documents, it was confirmed that the land was requisitioned by the enemy and puppet Hengchan Company. According to Article 5 of the Implementing Rules of the Land Rights Clearing Measures, "Land collected by enemy and puppet organizations at a price, unless there is a significant public need, should still be temporarily kept by the government and requisition procedures should be corrected. The original owner may present documents and redeem it by paying the price." However, since the Hengchan Company was taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, a public letter was sent to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau yesterday for verification and processing.</p>
<h3>Shen Junru Receives Reporters</h3>
<p>Shen Junru, representative of the China Democratic League, announced at a press conference yesterday that his mission in Shanghai is to prepare for the establishment of the Shanghai branch of the People's Freedom Guarantee Committee. He will leave Shanghai and return to Chongqing in a week.</p>
<h3>Routine Procedures Not Completed, Yang Wendao Not Released on Bail Yesterday, Court Release Order Expected to Be Issued Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yang Wendao, who has been imprisoned for ten years and was fully expecting to see the light of day yesterday, had to stay in Tilanqiao for another day because the court did not complete the procedures in time. However, there is no doubt that he will be released today.</p>
<p>Ruling Document Delivered</p>
<p>The ruling document of the High Court collegial panel was delivered yesterday morning. The main text stated: "The petitioner should submit a guarantee letter of more than one million yuan from a reputable merchant in the jurisdiction of this court to be granted a stay of detention." The collegial panel was composed of Criminal Court President Liu Yugui and judges Zhu Zonghai and Cao Jun. The date of the ruling was February 7 of this year. Yang Zihan Zhi and Tang Huaiqun Lawyer, who handled the case, immediately went to the residence of Yu Zhi Jing, a Cantonese business tycoon, to request a guarantee. Mr. Yu immediately agreed and ordered his secretary, Feng Jun, to accompany Attorney Tang and others to submit the guarantee letter to the High Court. The name of the store filled in on the letter was Huifu Industrial Company. However, Mr. Yu is also responsible for the fairly large scale Qinxing Shirt and Socks Factory, Red Cotton Socks Factory, etc. Therefore, although the guarantee letter stated "willing to be responsible for one million yuan," Attorney Tang jokingly said: "Mr. Yu's one seal is worth more than ten thousand yuan."</p>
<p>Yang's Friends Welcome Release from Prison</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 10:00, Yang Hanzhi and others went to Tilanqiao to wait, but the court stated that routine procedures such as review and investigation could not be completed yesterday, so the release order could only be issued and formally released today. It is heard that Guangzhao Public School will have a group of Boy Scouts line up at Tilanqiao this morning to welcome Yang Wendao's release from prison. In addition, several of Yang's fellow villagers, although making futile trips yesterday, will still go to welcome him today. Some of Yang Wendao's comrades who study martial arts will also go to "hang red" for Yang to celebrate. Yang Wendao's wife, Ms. Tang, has already prepared new robes for Yang to wear when he is released from prison. The news reported in the newspaper yesterday that Yang's wife had died surprised Han Xiao very much.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang has been in prison for ten years. Not only the prison authorities sympathize with him, but the other inmates also admire him very much. Last night, they specially purchased abundant food with their own money for Yang's enthusiastic farewell in prison.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminals Continue to Be Tried, Witnesses Hesitate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. Military Tribunal held its eighth trial of 18 Japanese war criminals for the murder of American pilots. Plaintiff Attorney Lieutenant Colonel Weiss has submitted the criminal evidence of war criminals Japanese Major General Kaburaki Masataka and Colonel Fukumoto Haruji to item 48. The 16th witness related to this case has also been summoned. The five witnesses summoned yesterday were all Japanese. The most important point is that the confessions of the main culprit Kaburaki Masataka, Fukumoto Kameji, and Kato Takumi, a member of the Hankou Model Youth Team, were read out by Lieutenant Colonel Weiss one after another. The reports of the Japanese witnesses also contained discrepancies and a special trial is scheduled for this morning.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fohai's Residence Had Been Sealed Off Long Ago</h3>
<p>It was reported the day before yesterday that Zhang Xinhua brutally murdered dancer Wu Jieying and her mother Wu Aizhu, and younger brother Wu Jiexin, a family of three, and then committed suicide. The news stated that Zhang Xinhua is currently a guard at the Sino-American Cooperation Institute, and Zhou Fohai's residence is now the office location of the Sino-American Cooperation Institute. According to reporters' investigations, Zhang Xinhua is not a guard at the Sino-American Cooperation Institute, and Zhou Fohai's residence has long been sealed off and is not the office address of the Sino-American Cooperation Institute.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Escorting Money Robbed, Police Officers Ambush and Kill Robbers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At around 11:40 yesterday morning, Yicheng Paper Store at No. 95-97 Shandong Road and Guangdong Road ordered apprentice Zhang Chunbao to escort 1.2 million yuan to the Asia Bank on Ningbo Road. Who knew that the bank was extremely crowded and could not count the money, and it was almost noon. Chunbao then carried the large sum of money back to the store. Unexpectedly, the robbers had already coveted it. When Chunbao returned to the store, the robber rushed in, threatened him with a gun, and robbed the large sum of money, fleeing south into Mantingfang to escape. At that time, store employees Zhang Youmei and Wu Songling saw this and jumped out to chase him. The robber turned to Zhengjia Wood Bridge on the neighboring street, crossed Zhongzheng Road to the intersection of Jinling Road. There was a traffic police officer Li Meitian at the intersection. Zhang and others went up to report, and the police officer immediately</p>
<p>Drew His Gun and Gave Chase</p>
<p>When they reached Yunnan South Road, two more police officers helped to encircle him. At that time, the robber desperately wanted to escape, so he hired a rickshaw driver to drive quickly, and Zhang Youmei also chased after him in a rickshaw. When they reached Zhongzheng Road, Xu Zhaolin, the captain of the first team of the seventh squadron of the third brigade of the Shanghai West District Security Corps, and corps member Wang Youjin, who were passing by on official business, heard the sound of the police whistle and bravely joined the chase. When they reached Zhejiang South Road, the police fired a shot</p>
<p>Into the Air</p>
<p>Ordering the robber to stop. The robber knew there was no place to hide and had to run forward. When he reached the Fuxingchang Ham Store at No. 154, lower level of the small vegetable market opposite the Shenzhou Hotel, he actually drew his gun again and fired to resist arrest. After police officer No. 1887 bravely fought back, he was hit four times and died. The stolen money and guns were left behind and taken to the police station for filing. The body was sent to the morgue for inspection.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Responds to Shipping Industry, Decides to Take Overall Account of Shipping Rights</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipowners Association, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and others jointly opposed the use of foreign ships flying the British flag on the Yangtze River route by the Executive Yuan's relief supplies, arguing that it would damage sovereignty. Recently, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) telegraphed the association and others in reply, explaining that flying the flag did not damage sovereignty. It also stated: "This agency takes into consideration both the shipping industry's sovereignty and the difficulties of the relief effort, and also expects understanding. As for the ships operated by Chinese people, this agency is even more willing to rent them as much as possible."</p>
<h3>High Court Continues to Try Traitors</h3>
<p>Shi Xikun Found to Have Internal Injuries, Rescheduled for Retrial. Traitor Shi Xikun was arrested by the Youth League and sent to the High Court for serving as a secret agent at the Japanese Consulate during the war and preventing people from hanging the national flag. During the court investigation, Shi denied everything and claimed to have been injured by torture and requested an examination. Yesterday morning, Judge Cao Jun continued the trial. The defendant's lawyer, Xi Xiaoruo, defended him. According to the injury report of forensic doctor Wei Ligong, it was briefly stated: "It was found that Shi Xikun had no external injuries on his chest, but had internal rib pain, which was caused by being injured by ironware. The injury was quite serious at the time, so he still felt pain several months later." The court ordered a retrial after it was ordered to question the special witness Jia Dechao.</p>
<p>Zhu Zonghai, judge of the Special Criminal Court of the High Court, applied to President Guo yesterday to resign.</p>
<h3>Two American Ships Arrive Today, Bringing a Large Number of Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>The Vice President and General Manager for the Far East of American President Lines, Mr. Stirling, has now created an automobile business and has resigned from the headquarters, which has been approved. The position of General Manager for the Far East will be assumed by Vice President Paul Derwiel. The company's President Grant is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. It is heard that a large number of mails, totaling more than 1,480 pieces, 3,400 tons of commercial goods, and eleven passengers are being shipped from the United States. Two ships from the American Steel Shipping Company will also arrive in Shanghai today, loaded with a large number of relief supplies.</p>

<h3>Readers Advocate for a Thousand Yuan National Construction Donation Movement, This Column Will Collect Donations and We Hope Everyone Will Promote It</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a professional youth who contributed nothing to the country during the war. Now that I share the glory of victory, I feel ashamed. Although the war has been won, national construction is still in its infancy. This is still an opportunity to serve the country. My strength is weak, so I will first donate 1,000 yuan in national currency as a "National Construction Donation." I know that the amount is small and will not help much. If your newspaper can make a loud appeal, then if each of our 450 million compatriots donates 1,000 yuan, there will be 45 million yuan, which can greatly benefit the progress of national construction. Some say that the poor cannot afford to donate. However, the rich, in addition to themselves, may wish to donate on behalf of ten, a hundred, or even a thousand or ten thousand poor people. If you are afraid that the vast area of ​​the country may not make everyone aware of the "Thousand Yuan National Construction Donation Movement," then you can imitate the chain transmission method of the "Jesus Blessing Letter," that is, after one person donates the "National Construction Donation," they will write ten letters of persuasion to relatives and friends, and their relatives and friends will also follow the same method after receiving the letter. In this way, one person transmits to ten, ten to a hundred, a hundred to a thousand, and a thousand to ten thousand, which will definitely have a great effect. I sincerely hope that this movement can achieve its expected goal as soon as possible and fulfill my wish. This depends entirely on the support of your newspaper, the assistance of public opinion, the cooperation of the banking industry in collecting money, and the enthusiastic response of compatriots. Reader Wang Zhelun respectfully bows.</p>

<h3>Gold, Paper Money, and Securities are Rising, Hidden Interest Reaches 18% of a Corner, Many People Scrambling for US Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, because of purchases by the Northern Gang and foreign merchants, U.S. dollars were extremely scarce. The U.S. dollar side had a lot of assistance. Although there was a mid-way rally, speculative merchants relapsed, and speculative funds scrambled to buy when they saw the opportunity, making it easy to pull up the price. The general mentality towards the listing issue changed from suspicion to more certainty, and sellers almost disappeared. From 1,285,000, it gradually competed for glory. Near noon, before the separation, it floated in the air to make up for the difference, and the noon close ended at a high price of 1,395,000, a sharp increase of 147,000 compared to the previous close. In the afternoon, it broke through another major level, standing firm, and people's hearts were more cheerful. Overnight delivery was very prosperous, opening at 1,430,000, the highest at 1,458,000. The credit was extremely tight, and the hidden interest reached 18% of a corner. Some people sold out when the price was high, once falling back to 1,395,000. Finally, it was around 1,410,000. Gold was listed at 153,000, silver at 1,400, and silver dollars at over 800 yuan. The dark split was from 12% to 18% due to the tightening of credit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. dollar was still due to the U.S. cotton order, and the settlement amount was huge. General foreign merchants also came to replenish their positions, and calls for higher prices rose again. It opened at 1,860 yuan in the morning, the lowest at 1,850 yuan. Manufacturers and general yarn and cloth gangs scrambled to settle. After that, it hovered and rose. In the afternoon, it rose to 1,970 yuan, then slightly fell back. The result was an increase of 90 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar rose because it was reported that the Shenchao in the area had mistakenly reported the U.S. exchange rate at 2,000 to one in the name of someone buying the United Association, causing a slump. This matter is now being investigated by the Hong Kong government and there is news that it has recovered. The market was flat, but the old goods suddenly had a large number of buyers due to the advance printing of cotton by large yarn and flower merchants. The result was extremely prosperous, and it rose another 20 yuan compared to the previous close. The new goods also rose by 7 yuan.</p>
<p>Public bonds were very stable yesterday. Type C opened in the morning and rose to 2,010 yuan. In the industry, due to credit, people sold out one after another when the price was high, so it gradually fell back from 2,060 yuan. During the period, it was seen at 1,880 yuan, hovering around 1,950 yuan at noon. The result of the noon close was 100 yuan better for Types A and B, 160 yuan for Type C, 150 yuan for Type D, and 110 yuan for Type E compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Hua stocks continued to be firm yesterday. There was a slight hesitation after the high point. The asking price after closing was slightly lower. In the afternoon, stimulated by the gold market, it rose again. Zhaoyong Yarn opened at 2,550 yuan in the morning, the high price was 2,680 yuan, and the noon close was around 2,600 yuan. The high price of Meiya was 2,150 yuan, and the low price was 1,950 yuan. Many yarn factories entered Meiya to hedge. The noon close still rose to 2,100 yuan. Jingfu rose from 124 yuan in the morning to 140 yuan. The noon close was around 137 yuan. Compared with the previous close, Yong yarn rose by 100 yuan, Xinhe rose by 90 yuan, Meiya rose by 300 yuan, Jingfu rose by 18 yuan, Xinguang rose by 13 yuan, and Qinxing rose by 10 yuan. The unpopular stocks each rose by about half a percent.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks rose sharply compared to the previous close as soon as the market opened. The demand was twice as stable. After selling Hua stocks, securities firms saw the gold market rebound and also came to replenish their positions in foreign stocks. The process was extremely enthusiastic, rising all the way. The result was that large stocks rose by less than 10% compared to the previous close, while small stocks rose by more than 10%. British United was the hottest, jumping by 15% alone.</p>
<h3>Rice Rises by a Thousand Yuan, Oil Rises by Three or Four Thousand</h3>
<p>Due to the rise in gold prices, the rice market is very strong. The average price of japonica and indica rice increased by 600 to 700 yuan to nearly 1,000 yuan. At noon, due to the continued issuance of flat-price rice by the Grain Administration Bureau, the stores were stunned and slightly declined. Soybean sales are still okay, and the price rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Raw peanuts rose sharply by 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran rose by 200 yuan. Bean cake also increased by more than 200 yuan. Flour also rose by 300 to 400 yuan. The oil market rose sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan as prices for other commodities rose and people's hearts firmed up, but it was difficult to grasp due to the sudden ups and downs.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Flowers, and Cloth All Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded sharply. From the opening to the closing, the market was always shrouded in buying interest. Green customers came in droves, and weaving factories were also busy with additional allocation. For example, 900,000 20s blue phoenix yarn were traded, an increase of 100,000 compared to the previous day. All other brands rose sharply, especially 42s double-strand and 40s single yarn, which rose sharply by 200,000. Because the Textile Construction Company has no supply of various brands that are popular in the market, only cone yarn is available for professional manufacturers of knitting and dyeing for their own use. The yarn industry peers have no right to purchase, and the sales chips are even more lacking.</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton trading was also smooth. Because gold and yarn prices soared, factories made a lot of profits by buying flowers and spinning yarn. The Textile Construction Company purchased a lot of fine velvet flowers. The fine velvet flowers in the Great Central Collection were as high as 101,000 yuan, and the Sanyuzhen flowers were as high as 93,000 yuan, an increase of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The cloth market was quite smooth under the search of the Jing, Hu, Huhu, Hangyong, Jiangxi and Hankou gangs. Colored cloth was pretty, and yuanbai poplin and shirt poplin were also favored by customers. Since the beginning of spring, yuanbai poplin has been so pretty, all because the weaving factory carefully manufactures 12-pound white raw fine cloth, which is very profitable, and there is no time for this reason.</p>

<h3>Let the Children Use Their Hands!</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>In Shanghai, children from ordinary families are generally pampered, with food brought to their mouths and clothes put on for them. This seems to have become the general custom of Shanghai society. When children are three to five years old, their parents say that they are still too young and cannot use their hands. From eight or nine to thirteen or fourteen years old, children can use their hands and like to use their hands, but their parents are unwilling to let them use their hands, thinking that having children do household chores would be looked down upon by the neighbors and would be detrimental to their image. When they are fourteen or fifteen years old or older, their parents want them to use their hands, but they have already developed the habit of viewing using their hands as troublesome and thinking of it as a hard task. Some even consider themselves too good to do such things, thinking that these are originally the duties of servants and are not worth doing. As a result, when they become adults, they not only lack the ability to handle household details but also lack the knowledge to manage servants, allowing the servants to be wasteful and lazy and to do things improperly, and they can only listen to them. Moreover, they develop a vain sense of self-esteem, with an arrogant attitude, looking down on servants, ordering them around, and despising the laboring class and so-called "lower occupations." They can never understand the true reality of this complex society, and even when they hold political office, they are unable to understand the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>In ancient Chinese education, primary schools emphasized sweeping and responding, starting with learning to do things themselves, which was indeed practical. A new-era parent will allow children to develop their abilities, not constantly do things for them, and cultivate their independent and active spirit. They also often encourage them to do miscellaneous chores and give them the experience of doing things. For example, when sweeping the floor, do not just sweep the center; when wiping a table, spread out the cloth, do not twist it into a ball; when washing dishes and chopsticks, dry them; when making tea, make sure the tea flavor is extracted and the leaves do not float on top; when tidying up a room, how to place things properly; what are the tricks to starting a coal stove; how to use soap when washing clothes and what the procedures are; how much water to use when cooking rice; how to cook a delicious side dish. In short, they should be able to do all kinds of common household chores. Girls should learn cooking and tailoring from an early age. This is not to say that women should return to the kitchen. With experience, they can manage servants. If servants are unable to do certain things, they can serve as a role model or teach them. In particular, taking care of younger siblings from an early age, learning some experience in infant care from the mother's methods, is much more valuable than adopting theories from books!</p>
<p>The author was born into a farming family. My late father treated his children by letting us use our hands and do everything. Needless to say, we had to do all the ordinary household chores, and we were allowed to learn everything else that we could. At the age of five, we had to herd cattle, and at the age of six or seven, we had to go up the mountains. Later, when we went to the city to study, there was work waiting for us to do every time we returned home for holidays. Weeding and watering were minor tasks, and we also had to participate in rice harvesting, firewood chopping, boat handling, and fish catching. As a result, I have experienced everything and know the hardship of "sweat dripping on the soil under the rice stalks." I know the danger of handling boats, so I learned to swim; the effort of chopping firewood; and how to be a vendor and sell things. I can even do all the work that farmers do, such as making rope, splitting bamboo, making straw sandals, rowing boats, and growing vegetables. After forty years of life, it is more than enough for me to apply what I have learned. I am truly grateful to my late father for his cultivation of us. Now, I would like to contribute the practical benefits I have gained to all parents as a lesson. Let me say one more thing: "Let the children use their hands!"</p>

<h3>Sending Children to Daycare Centers</h3>
<p>— Zhu Qi</p>
<p>In Chongqing, the things that needed to be done were endless, from morning to midnight. The child was only two years old. If I tried to take care of him, I couldn't get anything done all day. If I didn't take care of him, he had nowhere to play and would fall countless times and bump his head many times a day. Before the scars on his face had healed, new ones would appear. When he played at the door, he learned many bad habits, such as hitting and scolding people. I hired a maid to take care of him, but she was always wanting to eat and take things. She behaved well in front of the masters, but when the masters were not around, she would beat the child at the slightest provocation. While I was working, I had to constantly pay attention to the child, watching to see if the maid had taken the child to the crowded and dirty hotel across the street again, or if she had bought sesame candy covered in dust for the child to eat again. Moreover, the maid would be difficult. If I said a few words to her for doing something wrong, she would immediately want to leave. When I first arrived in Chongqing, I had wanted to send the child to a daycare center, but at that time, the ladies and wives who heard my idea unanimously opposed it, thinking that only they themselves could take good care of their own children. I myself had also seen children who had contracted pinkeye from daycare centers. At that time, the child was still very young and fell ill every few days, so I gave up the idea. Now, after being angered by the maid, I thought of daycare centers again.</p>
<p>At this time, the Chongqing YWCA was about to establish a daycare center, and the person in charge was Ms. Bian Xusun, who had previously been in charge of the workers' daycare center at the Shanghai YWCA. I had great faith in her, and the daycare center was located near my home, so I decided to send the child there.</p>
<p>Before entering the center, a physical examination was required. If a child had a contagious disease, he could not enter. He could start attending the center after three days. During these three days, I had to prepare a small quilt for him to use for his midday nap at the daycare center, a large white bib, mend his torn clothes and pants, and embroider the child's name on every handkerchief, towel, sheet, clothes, pants, and bib with colored thread. It really felt like preparing a dowry.</p>
<p>On the day of enrollment, I had put the clothes the child was going to wear, the clothes, quilt, towel, and washed cloth shoes he was going to take with him in separate packages the night before. I got up early in the morning, washed the child clean, had him go to the toilet, changed his clothes, shoes, and socks, and pinned a handkerchief with his name embroidered on it to his collar. I took him to the daycare center, and he was the first to arrive.</p>
<p>In addition to the director, Ms. Cao, there was also a nurse, two teachers, two nannies, and one male and one female servant in the daycare center. Because it was newly established, there were only fifteen or sixteen children aged two to four, so they were taken care of very well.</p>
<p>After the children arrived at the center, they first had a health checkup. If they were found to have a fever, they were made to sleep in the isolation room. If the fever increased, their family members were notified to pick them up. After the checkup, they ate breakfast and started a day of games and learning, until after dinner before returning home. The children ate soy milk and bread for breakfast, and lunch and dinner consisted of one dish and one soup, usually pork liver, eggs, and vegetables, which was more nutritious than what they ate at home. There was also a snack in the afternoon. They ate so well, and there were many toys and sanitary facilities that were not available at home. The monthly fee was also a little cheaper than the salary of a maid, not including what she ate, stole, and the bad influence on the child.</p>
<p>After sending the child to the daycare center, the house was much quieter, but I always felt empty and lonely, and I seemed to feel sorry for the child. Relatives and friends who knew about it also blamed me. However, after two weeks, the child, who originally needed someone to coax him to eat a bowl of rice, now ate on his own and could eat a bowl of soup, a bowl of rice, and a plate of vegetables at each meal, and he ate very quickly. Originally, he needed someone to hold him to sleep, but now he climbed into bed and slept on his own, and he no longer woke up in the middle of the night. He had gained a lot of weight. His speech had improved quickly, and he had also learned to sing. I only had to pick up and drop off the child every day and give him a bath once, and the rest of the time I could concentrate on doing things. Relatives and friends also agreed with my idea, because a well-managed daycare center had convinced them of their prejudices with facts.</p>

<h3>Female Warrior Huai</h3>
<p>— Zhang Peng</p>
<p>A shadow that cannot be erased often hovers in my mind. A shadow that cannot be chased away constantly flickers in my eyelashes. This tenacious shadow is my respected friend, Miss Yang Huimin.</p>
<p>It has been eight years since I last met her. It has been more than five months since the victory of the War of Resistance, and I have been looking forward to her return to Shanghai every day, paying attention to newspapers and inquiring from relatives and friends, but I have been disappointed and have not been able to find out any news about her whereabouts.</p>
<p>"Peng, let me introduce you," I was burying my head in editing the "Current Affairs Bulletin," when a Boy Scout, Cheng Renhou, jumped to my desk with innocent joy. Standing next to him was a tall and strong Girl Scout, her face also full of smiles, her eyes sparkling with lovely light: "This is Yang Huimin." Following his respectful attitude, she also bowed her healthy waist and nodded her head: "Mr. Peng, I am young and don't know much. Please teach me often!"</p>
<p>"Yang Huimin?" What a familiar name! Could she be the female hero Yang Xianmin who sneaked into the Sihang Warehouse to present the flag? I pondered for a moment, then my mind immediately answered me. Her heroic posture in front of me enlightened me. "It's her; it's her, she is indeed the patriotic daughter who risked her life to present the flag." I immediately put down my pen, my eyes shining with respect and admiration, and jumped up: "This is Miss Hui, who presented the flag!"</p>
<p>"Presenting the flag is not worthy of glory," she smiled coyly: "I hope that I can do more practical and beneficial work for the country in distress. Now that the national crisis has befallen every person, every person should serve the country and sacrifice himself for the country, whether male or female, and should take on the responsibility of a citizen to resist the enemy."</p>
<p>Her brave attitude and heroic words made me deeply respectful and admire her infinitely!</p>
<p>Later, as time passed, I became very familiar with her, and I knew everything about her very well. Her personality was like that of a heroic warrior. Her thoughts were like those of a modern woman. Her actions were similar to those of men. When she spoke, her voice was crisp and strong. When she walked, her posture was agile and vigorous. Although her face was not very beautiful (she had abolished the use of makeup), it was still very moving. Her clothes, although a yellow uniform, were very neat and simple. However, her hair was permed, loose and curly; when she ran, it added to her agility and vitality.</p>
<p>The environment in Shanghai became increasingly difficult. The current situation there did not allow her to carry out her brave mission. She had no choice but to leave Shanghai, bid farewell to her friends, and, with tears in her eyes and suppressing her sadness, flew far away to the rear.</p>
<p>On the eve of her departure, she showed no trace of sadness, and still jumped to my front: "Mr. Peng, I'm leaving!" A commemorative booklet was sent from her slender hand to the table: "Write a few lines for me, so that I can keep a memento when I get to the interior!"</p>
<p>"I can't write anything, please forgive me!" I wanted to say this, but I didn't say it; I couldn't say that to her. A female warrior whom I deeply admired was about to leave me, how could I not give her a minimal memento! So, without hesitation, I nodded my head and said: "Okay! You are the one who is leaving, I will write something for you."</p>
<p>"Mr. Peng, I'm leaving!" She also showed a tragic sentiment, forcing herself to endure it. Her voice was filled with grief: "When I get there, I will send you a letter. Don't worry about me."</p>
<p>I did not see her off, I just shook her hand tightly at the door, without saying any words of praise, silently; silently, I focused my emotional gaze on her sad cheeks, and when she walked far away, when I realized that she was no longer there, my frozen sadness quickly dissipated; scattered in my heart, my heart ached, and tears involuntarily rolled down my face.</p>
<p>Now it has been eight years, and I have not received any news from her. Although I learned from friends that she had been to the United States, and that she had made great and meaningful missions in the United States, we, her old friends in Shanghai, were deeply comforted, but it is still not as pleasant as the scene of shaking hands and talking happily!</p>
<p>I hope she will return soon and have a long talk with me to soothe my deep longing.</p>

<h3>Ms. Zhou Deqing Presides Over the Student Economic Cafeteria</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Low prices and substantial nutrition; difficult to sustain; hoping for donations from all sectors.</p>
<p>For students and office workers who work in public offices, lunch is indeed a serious problem. For the past four or five years, the Sichuan Road YMCA has been running a student economic cafeteria, under the responsibility of Ms. Zhou Deqing. Ms. Zhou graduated from Wallace University in the United States, majoring in home economics, and has special research in cooking and nutrition.</p>
<p>The establishment of that cafeteria was due to a donation of 15,000 yuan from the American Student Relief Association. Therefore, the YMCA jointly established a student economic cafeteria, with the English name Students Relief Economic Restaurant. At the beginning, Ms. Zhou was invited to take charge. It was established on September 10th of the 30th year of the Republic (1941).</p>
<p>One or two years ago, the author went there for lunch once, but because it was a treat, the food was different from what was served daily. Although the price of the food served in the cafeteria was unbelievably low, it fully considered the nutritional components and was planned by nutrition expert Dr. Hou Xiangchuan.</p>
<p>The working method is most democratic. Anyone who wants to eat there just buys a ticket and exchanges the ticket for food, tableware. After eating, they return the tableware themselves, so it is very quick and easy. From the beginning to December 31st of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the total number of customers served was 500,000.</p>
<p>The current prices are very low, divided into 20 yuan and 40 yuan. For 20 yuan, you can get two bowls of adzuki bean rice and a bowl of vegetable soup (a mixture of vegetables and soup), which would cost at least 100 yuan outside. For 40 yuan, you can get two bowls of white rice, one vegetable dish, and one soup, which would cost at least 180 yuan outside.</p>
<p>Since the cafeteria received the initial 15,000 yuan, it has not solicited any donations from the outside world, relying on that fund to operate. Since the beginning to the present, it has gone through several waves of rising prices, so the difficulty of maintaining it can be imagined.</p>
<p>Everyone will sympathize with such an economic cafeteria that truly serves the community. At present, it really needs assistance from all sectors, because the cafeteria's only remaining inventory has been used up. Therefore, it is hoped that all sectors can donate some flour, rice, sugar, or coal. It would be best to have milk so that the cafeteria can continue to provide young people with adequate nutrition at low prices.</p>
<p>These few days, they are repairing the stove, preparing to resume normal supply from February 18th.</p>

<h3>Electric Eye Mouse Trap</h3>
<p>— Wei Lin</p>
<p>A certain electrical company in New York rents out a highly effective scientific mousetrap for a monthly fee of thirty-five yuan. The device is made using the psychology that mice have a long-standing fear of blocked passages; it is a drawer-shaped wooden box with through-holes at both ends. The front is in the shape of the character 口 [kou - mouth/opening], with an electric eye installed in the passageway, and a small hole leads to the adjacent compartment.</p>
<p>When a mouse enters the passageway and touches the electric eye, doors at both ends immediately fall, blocking the front and rear, leaving it in a predicament. Only a small hole similar to a "fire exit" guides it into the compartment. The compartment is electrified, forcing it to climb into the upper corner "execution platform" to be electrocuted, and its corpse immediately falls into the corpse basket below. At the same time, the doors at both ends of the wooden box reopen, waiting for another patron to visit.</p>
<p>The entire rat-killing process takes only about three minutes. It is said that dozens of mice can be caught all night long.</p>
