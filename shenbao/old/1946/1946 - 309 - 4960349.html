<h3>國際輸華工農物資　上兩月數字特少　明春二三月輸入量將達最高峯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關人士吿記者：九·十兩月內，國際輸華之工農善後物資，其數字爲一年來之最低者。其原因所在，一爲美國之海員大罷工，至今尙未解決，此於物資輸華，影響最大；二爲農業機器大部份需在美國訂購，目前美本身需要甚切，定購需時，而英加兩國，在此方面僅能承造一小部份，故遝華之數量不大。一般估計：明春二三月時，輸入數量將達最高峯。至於各項主要農具之原計劃數字及已運到數字之比較，略如下表：</p>
<p>（原計劃數）</p>
<p>（已運到數）　（九月爲止）</p>
<p>曳引機　二，〇〇〇　二〇八</p>
<p>墾犁　五〇〇　四四</p>
<p>齒耙　二，〇〇〇　五〇</p>
<p>中耕器　二，〇〇〇　二〇</p>
<p>掛車　二，〇〇〇　三〇</p>
<p>（二吋）</p>
<p>離心力　二，〇〇〇　〇</p>
<p>抽水機</p>
<p>（四吋）</p>
<p>仝上　三，〇〇〇　〇</p>
<p>（五吋）</p>
<p>仝上　二，五〇〇　〇</p>
<p>仝上</p>
<p>一，〇〇〇　一七</p>
<p>（八吋）</p>
<p>仝上　一，〇〇〇　〇</p>
<p>（十二吋）</p>
<p>螺槳式　三〇〇　〇</p>
<p>抽水機</p>
<p>井機　二〇〇　二三</p>
<p>呎　呎</p>
<p>四吋井　一〇，〇〇〇　一〇一，七三〇</p>
<p>管</p>
<p>呎　呎</p>
<p>八吋井　二〇，〇〇〇　一五〇，九四五</p>
<p>管</p>
<p>註：因六吋管缺貨，聯總以四吋八吋代替，故超過原定額。</p>
<p>條播器　六〇　六〇</p>
<p>由上表觀之，已遝到之物資較計劃數字相去甚遠。惟據有關人士稱：國際間對於我國蓮用農業機器之印像甚佳，故原定數字，不致减少。以我國面積之廣大，即全數運到，亦不够分配，惟聯總之意見，爲此項物資僅在協助我國進行善後工作，將戰時失耕之土地施耕，使以後能恢復生產；至於農業機械化之實施，乃我國自身之事，非聯總所關切者。</p>
<h3>聯總運華肥料　共計約四萬噸</h3>
<p>又據記者獲悉：截至目前爲止，聯總運抵我國之肥料，包括未運上岸之肥料在內，共計約四萬噸。至於分配而言，過去三分之二運至台灣；因台灣地處亞熱帶，一年可種兩季，十月至十二月運到之肥料，只有台灣一地可用。台灣在日人統治下，每年消耗肥料四十萬噸，故明年度進口肥料之分配，台省至少佔二分之一。除台灣之外，餘數分配於粤桂　鄂皖豫贛各省。又聯總有價値一百萬美元以上之肥料製造機器，預定分配於永利公司。當局之意，擬將此項機器先無償撥給永利使用，然後訂立合同，由農林部以比較低廉之代價，收購共全部產品，即以此價款抵償機器之價格，在兩年內償淸。如此旣能增加我國化學肥料之生產，而民營工業亦有實惠。此項機器明春可運到。</p>

<h3>中美新商約約簽訂</h3>
<p>中美友好通商航海條約，業於昨日由我國代表外交部部長王世杰及外部條約司司長王化成與美國代表駐華大使司徒雷登及特派員天津總領事史密斯簽訂於南京。新商約包涵甚廣，以互惠平等爲原則，凡美國個人及公司在中國享受之權利，中國個人及公司亦可在美享受同樣權利，且各項權利均於條約中有明白詳盡之規定。新約定期五年，但雙方在期滿前一年如不表示終止條約之意，則此約將繼續有效。此項條約之簽訂，的確是我戰後外交第一件盛事。而且我們相信，中國與其他友邦之互訂商約，亦必繼之而起。此新商約現雖尙有待於中美兩國最高立法機關的批准，但簽訂旣基於平等互惠的原則，究爲中美兩國親睦關係的一種具體表現，而特別於此際有此項商約之簽訂，我們尤其感到欣慰。</p>
<p>友好通商航海條約是國與國交的基本行爲規則，舉凡一切關於兩國人民前往並僑居在各該國的待遇，悉規定於是項條約。因爲有兩國僑民的權利義務關係，故是項條約的規定，則等於法律的規定，爲各該國法律的一部。因此，友好通商航海條約爲國與國交的一種最重要的條約。年前我國與英美等國雖曾簽訂平等新約，但新約僅規定一般原則，並不曾有權利義務的規定，且其性質，消極方面多於積極性的規定，其目的偏在不平等條約及隨不平等條約以俱來的特權的取消。至根據前項條約，更進一步而爲兩國交往作一般詳細的規定，重新建立兩國的新關係的，實有待於通商航海條約的簽立。這是一種建設性的條約，將兩國的關係重建在新的平等的基礎上。中美兩國際太平洋相望，兩國間的關係向來密切，今繼不平等條約的廢止，我們看見有我們的盟邦，首先與我國有通商航海條約的簽立，將中美兩國的關係重新建立近一種新的基礎上，中國人民自必以極大的歡欣，來迎這種新關係的建立。</p>
<p>中美友好通商航海條約的內容，據所得消息，其特徵爲「消除治外法權之是後痕跡」，基於平等互惠之立塲，在以明白而合法之方式，規定兩國互相經營商業之原則。的確，前此所簽訂約巾美新的雖曾有放棄一切特權之規定，但如何消除「治外法權」之最後痕跡，端賴通商航海條約的簽訂。在目前中國的環境下，美國商民在中國所獲得的新權利，雖還不能一一實現，但旣有是項新權利的規定，將來中國局勢澄淸，在華美國人民必能享受，自可斷言。此次中美商約的簽訂，上海美僑的態度頗爲保留，且問有表示反感者，認爲彼等已放棄治外法權，所謂「治外法權之最後痕跡」，實不可解。凡此表示，其動　樅甚　潔，但若不加限制，其結果却可能造成與此次商約之簽訂原意相反的目的。因此，我們要在此地特別向僑居在山國的美國商民提出，目前的情况，雖與條約所規定的理想不盡相符，但這是暫時的現象，等到局勢澄淸以後，必定能够消滅。我們在這個時候還需要忍耐。</p>
<p>現在中美兩國的關係，旣因此次商約的簽訂而建立起一個新的基礎，我們深願其它國家亦能繼美國之後，與我國簽訂平等互惠的通商航海條約。中蘇，中英，中法，中荷雖有新的條約關係，但通商條約均尙有待於簽訂。中蘇地壤相接，我國的東北西北，與蘇聯貿易的接觸尤爲頻繁，我們希望中蘇間亦能早日有通商條約之簽訂。至於英法荷蘭等國，與我國的商務關係向稱密切，其應早日有是項通商條約之簽訂，以建立新的關係，亦不待言。因此，由於中美新商約的簽訂，我們希望別國也能早日與我國有新的商約關係的建立。</p>
<p>不用說，此次中美商約的簽訂，必大有裨益於中美商務關係的促進。中國正向建國的犬道邁進，在建國的努力上，美國可予我們以極大的援助。同樣，新興中國的出現，對於美國自身的經濟亦可有莫大的臂助。目前中美貿易雖稱發達，但一切都還沒有正常化。這要等中國局勢安定以後，中美的貿易纔能有正常的發展。我們歡迎在這個時候而有巾美商約的簽訂，因爲商約簽訂的木身就是一種安定力量。如何加强中美間的商務及一般關係，我們願由於此次商約的簽訂而更有事實的佐證。</p>
<p>最後，在此中美新商約簽訂之際，我們間或發見有少數美僑，最近對華常常發表含有誤會性的不友好的議論，非常遺憾。如本月二日大美晚報所載署名「前中國之友」者的來函，即其一例。這位讀者只知對中國人謾駡，甚至說「像一隻咬他主人的手的惡狗，呌囂着要外國人全部離開中國」，因此他要建議外國人發起一個「離開中國」運動。如這篇來函巾所舉的有些事實，如延不發還敵人侵佔的美僑產業之類，我們中國人誠應自己反省，以期見諒於人，但像這位讀者的偏見，把一部份別具用心而呌囂「反美」者看做是中國人全體的意見，也未免太盲目了。總之，國與國相處，最需互相瞭解，而中美旣稱友好，尤需通商，則彼此之間，心理上尤常自尊互尊，一掃任何偏執的成見。不過有一點，在新約簽訂以後，「治外法權的最後痕跡」旣經消除，我們對美僑之在中國，就該如華僑之在美國，互惠待遇，不必再有歧視的法律，例如在護照以外再有外僑出境旅行許可證之類，似是多餘的事了。我們深信中美兩大盟邦，其友誼必因此次新商約的簽訂而更增進；我們允願中美人士，無論在朝在野，一切言行都以加强邦交爲職志，而勿授人以挑撥離間的機會。</p>

<h3>外長會議難關重重　特港多瑙航運問題最棘手</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播：四強外長今下午四時（上海時間五日上午三時）在紐約阿　多里亞旅舍之一密室內集會，週圍戒備極爲嚴密。出席者爲貝爾納斯，莫洛托夫，貝文，及法外長皮杜爾之托表繆維爾。今日之會議可完全決定議事程序，　星期二即可進入　體討論。美國務卿貝爾納斯希望此次會議能就對德和約問題，獲得三種確切初步辦法：（一）各國對解除德國武裝之四十年協定，應表示確切態度，（按蘇聯始終未表示同意）（二）德國邊境問題應予解決，（三）四強外長代表應立即就對德條約開始實際工作，由四外長親自於四年予以考慮。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約四日電〕四外長會議今日在此開幕，將先結束義匈保羅芬　國和約懸案。關於此層，美蘇兩國現有小小爭執，即美國方面主張紐約四外長會議應以巴黎和會廿一國代表所決定之最後草約爲基礎，蘇聯方面不以爲然，主張以巴黎四外長會議當初所決定者與後來廿一國和會所修正者，加以比較，而不以後者爲最後草約。惟此層不致延緩今次四外長會議之工作。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約四日電〕四國外長定於今日開會，討論對歐洲五戰敗國之和約。四外長討論和約，此爲第五次。一九四五年九月第一次在倫敦開會，距波茨坦宣言之發表僅六星期，結果完全弄僵。第二次在莫斯科舉行，中法兩國並未列席，結果較有成就。但真正的進步，僅今春及今夏在巴黎舉行之第三第四兩次會議，該兩次會議奠定和會之基礎，爰有廿一國和會之召集。但當時殆已假定和會各項建議，將由另一次外長會議加以最後考慮，即今日開幕之會議是也。五國和平草約大體經和會通過，此際四外長所考慮者，僅以澄清四強間若干懸案爲限，但四國對於各該問題之見解大相逕庭，會議之成敗端視能否成立協定，其中以特里埃斯特問題與多瑙河航行問題是爲棘手。至於對德和約問題，若不正式涉及，亦將非正式加以討論。要之，四外長本屆會議對於歐洲未來和平機構，關係至爲重大，未可等閑視之。</p>
<h3>保國致備忘錄　提出五項要求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播：保加利亞政府頃以備忘錄致達四強外長，提出五項要求：（一）承認保加利亞爲戰時之共同交戰國，（二）准許保國在愛琴海覓得出口，（三）保方有權擁有魚雷艇，（四）保方應獲得復興之協助，（五）和約中有關解除希臘邊境武裝之款項，應予取消，因邊境早已解除武裝也。</p>
<h3>義反對和約</h3>
<p>記違反大西洋憲章</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕羅馬電台稱：義外長接見美記者稱，義政府將於下週五向四強外長提出備忘錄，聲明義和約草案與大西洋憲章原則不符，義政府將予以反對。此項備忘錄將由義駐美大使泰契阿尼親自送交四強外長。其要點爲：（一）義和約草案與大西洋憲章之原則不符，（二）義南分界綫·特港自由區界綫·以及義法分界綫，不能保障義領士之完整。（三）賠款以意大利在國外之財產作抵，使義國至於不能負担，其經濟能力爲之嚴重敗壞。南尼復謂義殖民地問題，今仍懸而未決。義代表團被邀赴美，非爲討論和約，而爲表示對殖民地的問題之意見。南尼並表示渠決不與南斯拉夫直接談判，繼稱，渠擬至世界各大國首都訪問，以與其討論貿易協定。義代表團不久即將啟程赴倫敦，最後更表示義大利當在世界及歐洲之利益範圍以內，保陣其本身之利益。</p>
<h3>安理會開會　討論波蘭提案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播：安理會今日下午三時開會，討論波蘭之提案。按波蘭曾要求安理會不再檢討弗朗哥問題，俾可改向聯合國大會提出，眾料波蘭提案可獲通過。依照憲章規定，任何問題若仍在安理會議程中，則聯合國大會不能對之採取任何行動。</p>
<h3>聯合國代表　謁羅斯福墓</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約海地園四日電〕聯合國大會五十一國代表，在大會主席史巴克率領下，昨日在比羅家花園墓地，公祭故總統羅斯福，羅夫人愛倫諾亦在場。蘇外長莫洛托夫由外次維辛斯基等陪同，以紅玫瑰花圈一事，獻置故總統墓前，並發表簡短演說稱：「余相信蘇聯代表團之情緒，可以下列一語表而出之，即「永遠追念偉大的羅斯福總統」是也」。</p>
<h3>南國總統確信　戰爭不致發生</h3>
<p>〔聯合社貝爾格勒三日電〕蒂托總統今日在三十萬人民眾大會發表演說，謂余確信不致戰爭，因全世界人民皆不欲戰爭。吾人欲改善國際關係，尤其是對美關係。蒂托繼又重申前言，要求美國交還在多瑙河上遊所扣之南國船舶。</p>
<h3>美陸軍後備隊　規模租具</h3>
<p>百萬退伍官兵投効</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕美陸軍部今日披露：美陸軍戰後後備軍正在切實形成中，已有退伍官兵近百萬人投效。據官方人士稱，後備軍之規模，現正依照預定速率擴大，或許較預定速率更爲迅速。同時，正規軍之範圍，則迅趨减縮，而規模較小之國防軍，現亦力圖克服困難獲取壯丁，以補充實力。</p>

<h3>美對太平洋基地　決長期單獨保管　杜魯門總統重申立場</h3>
<p>〔路透社米蘇里州獨立城三日電〕杜魯門總統今日重行申明，美國決定在長時期內，單獨保留控制太平洋內與美國安全有重大關係之各日本島嶼，島嶼之不與美國安全有重大關係者，則將交與聯合國機構，或將在該處設立集體托管制。</p>
<h3>託管制問題</h3>
<p>美蘇意見未能一致</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖三日電〕外傳蘇聯政府或將採取行動，阻止聯合國託管理事會之設立，聯大會美代表團正以極大努力加以挽回。消息靈通人士稱，傳聞蘇政府或將採取一種立場，主張未經蘇聯批准，不得成立託管協定後，美代表團已與若干代表團並蘇聯在內進行磋商。此事牽涉法理問題，即蘇聯是否聯合國憲章所謂「直接關係國」。憲章規定，直接有關之全體國家應批准各項草約，然後可予接受。蘇聯以爲五強全體以託管理事會委任國資格，合於憲章定義。聞美代表團爲確保託管理事會於本屆聯合大會中設立，已向蘇聯及其他國家直接呼籲，要求對於何爲協定直接關係國一點，暫緩作何解釋。國對於五強應否爲關係國一點，美代表團迄未決定，蘇聯倘堅持爲直接關係國，則問題勢必提付大會表決。蘇聯可以運用其權利，等於否決權無異，除非大會以三分之二多數決定蘇聯爲關係國。組織草約倘不經關係國家及大會通過，託管理事會即無從成立。大會五十一國託管委會本星期內將就八項草約開始一般討論，蘇聯殆將利用比一機會，表白其立場。</p>
<h3>英國內艦隊　演習攻防隊</h3>
<p>〔路透社英國陶賽郡威茅斯城三日電〕英國內艦隊舉行四日之假想戰演習後，已於今日駛返波特　海軍根據地。學習指揮官爲艾弗雷上將，以主力艦「喬治五世」號爲旗艦，參加者各式艦艇，包括甫於日本投降後開始服役之最新式巡洋艦會同航空母艦「無敵」號及「桑德蘭〕號之飛機，皇家空軍之噴火式機，以及海底之潛艇，在蘇格蘭極北至英國南岸之海面，演出像真之攻防戰。在海勃里治迤南海面，並有供應船四艘編成護航隊，由海底及空中部隊施以聯合攻擊。</p>
<h3>美議員州長競選　今日可決定勝負</h3>
<p>杜威可望連任紐約州長</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓三日電〕美國會　州長之競選將於十一月五日由美國投票人決定勝負，目下不少人正在逐鹿，其中最精彩而最重要之競選在紐約與加利福尼亞二州。此二州之競選已引起一班評論家之注意，候選人均屬全國知名之士。共和黨之杜威一九四四年總統選舉中敗於羅斯福之手，而被認爲一九四八年之總統候補人，現正力圖連任紐約州長。渠之對手爲民主黨參議員米特，在國會中向有勢力，而竭力擁護羅斯福與杜魯門者。投票處預示杜威勝利之希望甚大。紐約競選運動之演講，大半以屋荒及其他內政問題爲主題。共和黨候選人猛烈攻擊政府處理內政之失常，但對美國既定外交政策之態度，則以紐約州議會共和黨領袖伊夫斯全力擁護此一政策之宣言爲代表。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播：　日美大選開始舉行，投票者三千五百萬人。此次選舉結果，將決定杜魯門總統之政權是否能繼續控制國會，各方面對於選舉結果極爲關切，打賭者甚眾，咸認爲共和黨將在眾院佔優勢，而民主黨則可在參院中略佔上鋒。民主黨鑒於共和黨之咄咄逼人，已出全力相爭，若干黨員企圖以已故羅斯福總統之「神聲〕爭取勝利，羅故總統之演詞留聲機片已在各處播送，羅總統夫人亦在各處發表演說，爲民主黨効命。</p>
<h3>蘇革命紀念　史達林將演說</h3>

<h3>蘇外交政策　金融文化交流　無意加以妨阻</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科三日電〕真理報今日發表一文，闡明蘇聯外交政策，謂蘇聯絕不阻碍本國與世界其餘各國問商業及文化關係之改進。全世界任何一處，蘇聯並不侵犯美國或其他任何一國之合法利益，關於此層，史達林總理日前業已加以聲明。蘇聯建國，既以互相尊重及權利平等爲基礎，自絕不致妨碍彼此間金融，科學及文化之活潑的交流。</p>
<h3>戰後日捕鯨船隊　下週內首次出發</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京四日電〕日本捕鯨船兩隊，將於下星期分自橫須賀及長崎兩地出發，經澳洲西海岸至南冰洋一帶捕鯨。是爲日漁船戰後第一次至南極捕魚。</p>
<h3>對日賠償問題　美拒蘇建議</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓四日電〕合眾社今日獲悉，美政府已拒絕蘇聯之建議，即將蘇聯自東九省奪取之大量工業設備，不包括於日本賠償項目範圍之內。此點使遠東委員會召開日本賠償會議之努力，又遭新挫折。</p>
<h3>日本社會黨聲明　不再與內閣合作　吉田發表具體政第六項</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京四日電〕日本社會黨爲完成制憲後解決糧食問題，在漫長之第九十屆議會中放棄其在野黨之立場，表示對政府協力。茲值新憲法公布，進入解決糧食問題之際，該黨忽聲明恢復其立於勤勞大眾地盤上之未來立場，確定其在野黨之態度。該黨今日舉行中央執行委員會，討論十一月下旬召開九十一屆臨時議會時是否應立即展開倒閣運動，抑應提出吉田內閣不信任案。經協議結果，認爲內閣今日發表之六大繁急政策，不成爲戰敗後日本復興之基礎，故應即提出不信任案。同時發表聲明，否認該黨繼續對吉田內閣協力之傳說，決定糾合民主勢力，與保守陣營鬥爭。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京四日電〕日政府今晨發表聲明，闡明臨時機會閉幕後及憲法公佈後之基本政策，並公佈目前即須實施之具體事項，籲請國民協力。聲明內容首先強調爲實現民主主義，須先刷新教育制度，並確立國民生活之經濟基礎，以圖和平國家之重建，及國民文化之啟迪。所舉六項具體政策爲（一）新憲法之普及，（二）教育制度之刷新，（三）行政機構，公務員制度及其運用之改革，（四）地方自治之確立，（五）產業經濟之重建，（六）勞動問題之解決及民生之安定。以上內容針對十月攻勢以後之勞動不安，企圖一舉解決各項間題，可謂吉田內閣成立以來首次發表之具體政策。其中最重要之勞動對策，不無若干新方向。「合理的參加經營及促進利潤之分配」一項，與前此否認勞工管理生產之聲明背道而馳，表示吉田內閣不得不重視勞工，求其積極協助，可謂該內閣勞動政策之一大轉變。</p>
<p>麥帥特許　建造小輪</p>
<p>〔改造社東京四日電〕麥帥總部以日本內海航路，旅客輻　，頃又特許日政府建造小型輪船廿八隻，以資內海交通而便行旅。再總部經濟科學處工業處並在考慮計劃建造新客船七十六艘計七萬二千三百噸，以利旅客運輸。</p>
<h3>英報指摘日新憲　謂係美國之憲法</h3>
<p>〔路透社英國李治四日電〕英國北部保守黨之領袖報紙「約克夏郵報〕今日評稱：在東京宣布之新憲法，非爲日本憲法而爲美國憲法，此一憲法與日本日常生活之其他各種現象，均令人感覺麥帥乃日本之皇帝，日人唯一之途徑即爲取悅於委帥。對於日本民族最具了解之人士，均不免懷疑一旦推翻二千年歷史之制度而強迫日人接受西方民主觀念，究竟是否智者之舉。今日日本之問題，在封建制度與良好政府之間。本身之領悟而非他人之強授，始可使戰時所獲痛苦教訓產生良好之效果。</p>
<h3>印荷頒令停戰</h3>

<p>〔路透社巴黎四日電〕法國「抵抗日報」記者在巴黎附近訪問巴勒斯坦恐怖團體史德恩黨某領袖，談話時兩人間有帳幕隔絕僅聞聲而不能見面。據該領袖稱；史德恩黨與所有反抗英帝國主義者之份子，如印度人·愛爾蘭人·希臘人·埃及人·叙利亞人·及印度尼西亞人，均有接觸，該黨具有第一流之諜報工作人員，曾受前英美諜報團及蘇聯秘密警察之訓練，該黨與英國諜報隊內部，甚至亦有情報連絡。英官方之電話能由該黨竊聽，英官廳內亦置有秘密傳聲器，故英方有何計劃，事前均能爲該黨探知，該領袖預示，巴勒斯坦之恐怖活動將見增加，並謂耶路撒冷回教主赫賽尼乃英方間諜，故有史德恩黨之密探經常予以秘密監視。</p>

<p>聯大會場一瞥　（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）</p>
<h3>聯大難題之二　領土託管問題（下）</h3>
<p>本報資料室</p>
<p>憲章第十一章閘述託管原則，規定擔任託管的強國應「承認以領土居民之福利爲至上之原則」，「以充量增屆民福利之義務爲神聖之信託」，並進應「按時將關終各會員國分別負責管理領土內之經濟，社會及教育情形之情報，遞送秘書長，以供參考。」</p>
<p>第十二章規定託管制度，條文甚多，簡略地歸納如下：（一）託管的終極目標應是「增進其趨向自治或獨立之逐漸發展」；（二）託管制所適用的領土共有三類：（1）現在委任統治下的領土；（2）因第二次世界大戰結果或將自敵國割離之領土；（3）負管理責任之國家自願置於該制度下之領土。按這三類和克里米亞會議中所商定的原則是大略彷彿的。（三）關妙託管之條款，應由「直接關係各國〕予以議定。（四）任何託管協定內得指定一或數個「戰略防區」，關於戰略防區之各項職務，應由安理會行使之。至於其他非戰略防區託管協定之職務，則由大會行使之。</p>
<p>第十三章爲託管理事會之組織。理事會理事係由大會推選，任期三年，其數目必須管理領土者及不管理領土者谷占其半，以資公允。但美，英，中，蘇，法，五強則爲當然理事。</p>
<p>憲章既定，第二步，聯合國的託管委員會即於一九四五年八月至十二月間在倫敦集會，後又在次年一月召開的聯合國首次大會中提出討論。大會中乃通過議案，請過去管理國聯委任統治地的國家擬具條件辦法，使各舊委任統治地能轉置終國際託管制度之下。</p>
<p>現在，聯合國二次大會舉行了，英國已將坦干尼加·吐谷蘭·及喀麥隆三地的託管條件送達聯合國大會。美國方面亦正擬將佔領下的太平洋上加羅林及馬紹爾羣島（以前是日本的委任統治地）交付託管理事會，但表示：這些島嶼是美軍以血肉換來的，所以並不願放棄管治。南非則聲明要歸併自己委任統治下的西南非。至於義大利的那些殖民地呢，則至今未見提起。總之，舊國聯委任統治地的處置辦法是不難的，且也不致會引起多少紛爭，但義大利殖民地和太平洋上的那些島嶼的託管問題，（尤其是後者）則定將引起極尖銳劇烈的爭執。憲章中的託管精神和辦法，究竟不過是一些空洞的原則，能不能够行得通？還得看強國間有沒有誠意互相合作。</p>

<h3>標賣與房慌　萬餘住戶緊急呼籲　要求安居樂業</h3>
<p>參議會議決：應尊重租賃權益</p>
<p>吳市長面允：原住戶繼續租賃</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自中央信託局受敵偽產業處理局委託，第二次標售敵偽房地產，登報公告後，成萬住戶頓起失屋荒，紛紛於報端刋登啟事，有所聲明。記者昨日往訪威海衛路威海別　租戶，據告稱，渠等登報呼籲係求安居樂業，希望政府以安定現實爲上策。該別歌全體租戶呈文政府堤出三點，其一，要求取消標賣，因標賣所得之款，取之於民，亦用之於民，何不取消標賣，由政府租與各住戶。其二，倘政府堅持標賣，該別墅各租戶，亦極表歡迎。唯希望購主以置產爲目的，維持原租賃關係。其三，倘因需維持原租賃關係，而無人購買，該住戶等願勉力共同購買，但請中信局佔價優待，予以優先承購權，因渠等無力競購。該別墅住戶所持之主要理由爲，所有居戶並非敵偽，而租居該屋，又均遠在建築之初，既非租自敵偽，亦非於敵偽退出後所佔用，或臨時撥用者。政府處理辦法，自當與勝利後佔用者，有所區別，方屬公允</p>
<p>至於吳淞路大興里，東興里，山陰路，乍浦路等處敵產房屋租戶，亦分別刋登啟事，係感唇亡曲寒，中信局尚未標賣該處房屋。據東興里等處租戶告記者稱，渠等於本年五月中向市府請願，曾得吳市長面允，有繼續租賃權。</p>
<p>據中信局地產處負責人稱，此次標售，問題並不甚嚴重。該處係受託辦理，甚願各敵產房屋租戶，能參照底價，投標自購。目前地產呆滯，大里弄房屋，投標者極少。該局第一次標售敵偽房地產共有七處，結果僅售去三處。至於佔價優待，該局認爲不能辦到，因公開投標係政院所確定之原則。</p>
<p>記者赴處理局時，沈冠亞氏告以民法二條：四二五條，「出租人於詛賃物交付後，縱將其所有權讓與第三人，其租賃契約，對於受讓人，仍繼續存在」。另有一項，係四二五條，「租賃定有期限者，其租賃關係，於期限屆滿時消減。」以上二條，係解決標售後房屋糾紛之法律根據。據悉，處理局曾一度呈請政院，將敵產房屋售於現住人，惟行政院批示公開標售。</p>
<p>中信局第一次標售之三處房屋，膠州路康腦脫路有一處雖已有人出價標購，但因有原住用之機關住用，行政院宋院長曾數次命令遷讓，處理局亦曾請警備司令部協助，唯迄今仍由該機關住用。故有錢標購敵偽房地產者，亦無人敢輕於嘗試，因捲入此項糾紛中，現款既擱淺，而又無法使用房屋也。</p>
<p>又市參議會地政委員會昨開第三次會議，列席地政局局長祝平，會中討論提案五件：</p>
<p>（一）准申報館本年十月廿一日函送讀者郭子東張斌君來函，對房屋租賃事項有所陳述，轉請參考一案，提請討論案，決議：關於房屋租賃糾紛一案，現立法院正在起草房屋租賃處理條例，如有糾紛，可由當事人逕向主管機關或法院申請辦理，並函復申報館。（二）據市民楊魁梧呈請嚴禁房主不得恣意擅令房客出屋一案，提請討論案，決議：併第一案辦理。（三）據市民王道三等三十三人聯名呈請賜予議訂情理兩全之蓋屋地皮租賃辦法，以補救社會糾紛一案，提請討論案，決議：獎勵造屋，市府已有辦法規定，至於利用他人土地建築房屋一節，係屬所有者之主權問題，應依法辦理。（四）准地政局本年十月十六日（三五）滬地三清發字第三二一八號公函抄送前法公董局未經移交公地統計表一份，函請查照等由，根請研究案，決議：存會備查。（五）准威海別墅房客聯合會本年十月十二日箋函，略以原承租人有繼續承租權一案，請將敵偽房屋包括在內，一律同樣適用，賜予補充規定，提衣討論案，決議：函請市府轉知敵偽產業處理局暨中央信託局，於標賣敵偽產業時，應尊重合法租賃之權益。</p>
<h3>房荒聲中好消息　營造執照請領多</h3>

<h3>周逆佛海丑表功　地下人員嗤以鼻　明斬暗殺　摧殘無餘　藏匿電台更屬無稽</h3>
<p>報載首都高院二日再審周逆佛海時周逆竟稱曾多方協助並掩護地下工作人員，例如營救戴濟民，程克強，蔣伯誠，在日人搜查電台最嚴緊之時，曾將中央工作人員之電台藏匿于家中云，此項消息發表後，上海地下工作人員及各方人土，均嗤之以鼻，蓋周逆充任傀儡時期，對中央地下工作人員，明斬暗殺，無所不用其極，至所謂將電台藏匿于家中，更屬荒謬無稽。按當時敵人搜查電台最嚴緊時，周逆曾助紂爲虐，竭力摧殘，致有不少地下電台爲所破獲，均屬鐵的事實，盡人皆知。周逆如此之丑表功，雖　減輕其罪惡，然此間人士，對此無不表示憤慨。</p>
<h3>加強提倡節約酬應運動　請撥杜剛等三烈士葬費　市黨部執委會議通過</h3>

<p>又市黨部於昨晨九時，假該部大禮堂舉行國父紀念週，出席方主任委員，陳處長葆泰，徐處長鳴亞，陶處長百川，及各委員暨全體同志百餘人。由方主委主席，領導行禮如儀後，即席致詞，略謂：檢討最近一月來工作之推進，尚未能收到預期之效果，今後盼各同志勉力從公，實事求是，謀求全部工作之開展，並勗勉各同志負起責任，嚴守紀律，樹立新風氣，末宣講黨員守則後禮成。</p>

<h3>試驗無綫電警車效能　表演捉強盜　七分鐘結束</h3>
<p>和尚寺　點心店　大受虛驚</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕值此冬防時期，老閘警分局爲加緊防務鞏固治安，利用新近裝配之無綫電吉普卡，測騐捕盜效能起見，於昨日下午四時許，舉行捕盜演習，結果成績優良，表演逼真，於七分鐘內完全達成使命，茲將表演經過情形分誌於次：</p>
<p>老閘分局局長施思兼，於昨日下午四時許獲報，謂有持械匪徒五名，侵入廈門路二三七號華豐鐵號行劫，當由施氏偕股長蔣上佩·巡官張汝中·劉學孝暨第一股長蔡承德，連同司法股幹警廿餘名及製服長警四十餘名，分乘警備車二輛，首由施氏駕駛無綫電吉普卡領導，馳往目的地，得悉一匪着藍布長衫，手携皮包，已乘三輪車逸去，尚有匪徒遁入同路二四八號永慶禪寺內，於是趕往該處，將禪寺包圍，四週警探密佈，先由身着保險馬甲之警員奮勇衝入，將化裝匪徒兩名，一衣中山裝，一服西裝者擒出，得悉尚有兩匪在內，遂由施氏在無綫電話筒中向匪徒警告，如不就範自動外出，即將下令發槍，語甫學，乃由施氏手執籐牌，後隨蔣股長張劉兩巡官等，一擁而入。未幾，果將二匪捕獲，交由警士一併押回局中。一面即由該無綫電通告分局，再由分局致電各崗警，一體留心在逃匪徒，嗣該輛無綫電吉普車在轄境內兜捕，至福建南路中正路口，察覺雇乘三輸車之一匪，撞翻自由車一輛，倉皇逃入金鴻興點心店內，警員等立即躍下吉普卡緊追而入，該匪遂束手就擒，在其身畔抄出實彈手槍一支，帶局偵訊。在此次表演中，化裝盜匪者，均係該分局便警，計宋家寶·戈宗浩·周連生·李駿坤·宋紹科等五人。斯「案」由四時接得報告起，至四時〇七分止，爲時僅七分鐘，匪徒五名全部落網，表演亦遂告結束。可見利用無綫電捕盜，極有效騐，深望市民自動集資多多購賣該項車輛餽贈各警局使用，對於治安之增進，當大有裨益也。</p>

<h3>唐壽民發回更審　供稱收買紗布係爲人民着想　袁良出庭作證提供有利證據</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕曾任偽商統會理監事長之唐壽民案，前由本市高院判處無期徒刑。被吿奉判不服，上訴最高法院聲請覆判，由該院五庭審判長周韞輝於本年九月十三日判決撤銷原判，發還更審，其理由爲：（一）收買紗布爲人民着想，原審未提。（二）唐係爲被俘而來，並非甘心。（三）參與抗戰有利證據，原審不提。該項判決書於十月間送達本市高院，昨日下午乃開庭再審，並傳到袁良，提詢林康侯兩證人。</p>
<p>受審時之唐壽民（中國社攝）</p>
<p>唐衣灰色法蘭絨長袍足穿圓口皮鞋，平頂頭，髮已灰白。供稱：現年五十五歲，鎭江人，前任交通銀行總經理，太平洋戰起，適在九龍，迨九龍淪陷，乃爲日憲俘虜。於卅一年四月十五日派機押回上海。當時僞府曾邀參加政治活動，經堅決拒絕，僞財政部乃委任爲偽交通銀行董事長，中國交通兩銀行後於同日復業，但此事於香港時早有風聞，並非被吿所主持籌備復業者。偽全國商業統制總會組織之發起，係因當時上海物價很高，</p>
<p>民不聊生</p>
<p>不統制無從抑平，乃由偽實業部長梅思平來滬召集各界領袖商討，並指定二十人爲該會之發起人，再選定理監事。被吿自卅二年三月十五日至卅三年六月底擔任該會理事長，當時敵偽收買紗布，範圍廣及蘇浙皖三省，且不付現款而代以票據。被吿對此反對最烈，僞府後將此事交付商統會辦理，迫不得已乃提出數點，以爲商民解：（一）縮小收買範圍，僅以上海爲限，其他各地自由。（二）布價付現款，一半黃金，一半中儲券，此黃金價格依市價一半計算。（三）日商紗布應與華商一律收買。被告爲此，費盡心血，但日人如何肯將</p>
<p>金子繳出</p>
<p>被告乃揚言如「大東亞戰爭」勝利，美國失敗，金本位打破，則黃金將不値錢。故如不肯將金子放出，即係自信不能獲得勝利者。結果日人無法辯駁，乃拿出二十餘噸金條。勝利後國軍接收「中央儲備銀行」之大批存金、即由此而來。被吿又恐敵僞再施狡計，拿出黃金後，將來再下令黃金收歸「國有」。故向偽財政部探詢是否准許自由賣買，答曰可。被吿乃將此覆文轉請僞市府公吿人民，一面以商統會發言人之地位，在報上發表談話，此亦一番苦心。此外又規定土紗交織品等免除收買者，共達十三類。而僞府亦曾命令商統會至火車站及四郊設稽査處，以防偷運出境，但未予照辦，此皆爲商民解脫云</p>
<p>袁良出庭作證</p>
<p>審訊至此吿一段落，繼之傳問證人。前北平市長袁良稱：現年六十四歲，杭州人。民國廿七年一月十七日奉蔣委員長電召至漢，委派在上海主持情報。二月間抵滬，即開始工作。本人與唐素識，但無深切關係。卅二年唐由香港回來，卅三年四月政府來令要重要經濟情報，乃轉吿唐搜集金融工商各方面資料，作就報吿，由徐延身携往重慶，途中適遇浙贛戰事發生，乃在贛州將信交蔣經國，再由蔣派機送往重慶。後徐於九月回滬。第二次報吿係由殷體揚經蚌埠携往重慶，本人並附呈</p>
<p>主席，張岳軍，孔祥配熙，熊式輝各函。待卅四年一月殷回上海，帶來張岳軍之信，主席囑若上海靑黃不接，希能維持，故本人乃有一秘密組織，下設九部，其中交通與物資兩部由唐負責，以防萬一敵人撤退時，維持秩序，解決各項問題。本人之情報，軍事方面由自己搜集，經濟方面則十九由唐供給云。</p>
<p>提訊林康侯香港被俘事</p>
<p>在押之林康侯稱：七十一歲，上海人，太平洋戰起時在九龍，後由唐等同被日人監禁於半島飯店，後又轉禁香港飯店。李思浩，顏重慶，周作民等皆在一起。卅一年四月十五日專機押回上海。被吿之辯護律師並呈上李思浩之證件一紙，所述與林康侯所供者相仿。辯護律師並請庭上於下次開庭時傳詢現天津副市長張子奇等證明被吿供給情報那份。庭諭待考慮後再決定傳詢與吾。本案改期再訊，被吿還押。</p>

<h3>修建京滬杭公路　計劃重築永久式橋梁　按照目前預算需款六百億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通部公路總局，第一區公路工程管理局局長粟少松氏，日前偕該局科長等自京來滬，視察京滬，滬杭，京杭各路情形。該局自本月一日起，已分別成立上海，杭州，南京三工程處，負責各段公路。目前京滬，滬杭兩路，睛天全綫勉强可通車，遇霪雨則無法行駛。至於京滬錢，戰前亦僅通至無錫，目前僅通至常熟。該局擬修復錫宜路，將來由滬至京，繞道宜典而行。無錫句容暫不修理。上述三大公路，戰時損失均極慘重，尤以橋樑破壞爲最甚。公路局方面計劃重築永久式之橋樑，載重二十噸。京滬路擬舖設甲種路面，路基十二公尺寬，路面九尺寬，公路與公路間或與鐵路間之交又道皆爲立體式，以期澈底避免撞車悲劇。所謂立體式，交又道或係產起如橋樑，成係地道式。如一旦完成此種甲種路面，汽車每小時可行一百公里。該局計劃明年年底可完成，但依目前物價預算，已需六百億。故究竟何日完成，全視經費而定，錢不够，二年三年亦難說也。</p>

<p>盜賣房產</p>
<p>曹斌問我家有祖遺房屋二幢。一家父所有（甲屋）一爲叔父所有，　（乙屋）因叔父早故，子女尙未成人，故該屋由家父代管，廿六年抗戰發生後，鄙人即投筆從戎，効忠祖國，勝利後復員回家，悉該二屋已爲家父賣去成交時，言明如房屋不限期出淸，則在賣款內扣除若干，作爲抵押，現該屋早已出淸，而買主仍不將該款退回。茲有法律問題數則，祈予以解答。（一）抗戰重人對於家屬所作之買賣，未經本人同意，能宣佈其無效否？（二）乙屋爲家叔所有，家父將其賣去，是否合法？能否收回？（三）房屋出淸後，押金不退回，是否違法？應如何措置。</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕　（一）抗戰期中所有賣買契約，如無憑藉敵僞勢力情事，當然有效。（二）盜賣他人之產業，其所立契據，當然無效。（三）如無特約，該項扣留之款，自可取回。</p>

<h3>粉價議定後　小麥步漲電費增加　麵粉廠左右爲難　政府設法促洋麥進口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據麵粉業中人語記者，本市各麵粉廠，前因缺乏原料，而一度停工。茲者雖復吿工，惟開工情形，純視是否能獲得小麥而時開時輟。據悉：上次吳市長召集麵粉業議定麵粉新價格時，小麥每担之市價，尙僅二萬七千元，而麵粉每袋之出廠價，經議定爲一萬九千元。近日來小麥每担已步漲至三萬二千元，且工廠用電價格，自十一月一日起，已增爲每度一百八十元，故麵粉廠照新議價產粉，又將虧蝕，又據談：小麥禁止出口，僅限本市。而事實上本市小麥存底，早在禁令施行之前，已極枯薄。而蘇州，無錫，常州，鎭江一帶，迄朱禁止小麥出口。據估計：目前自蘇錫等地運麥一担至本市之成本，已扯三萬一千五百元，與本市市價相差無幾，故各地產麥，均運往麥價較高之區。各廠爲欲大量產粉，勢必親往產區搜購。聞政府方面，刻仍在積極設法，務使十萬噸洋要早日運華云。</p>

<p>米市消化清懈，各貨登記一萬二千餘石，南粳續小千元，北粳高定次削，羊杜秈略見疲勢，回小三五百元，客秈埠秈亦成軟化，白元去化最爲呆滯，節節下降，陰元高貨平平，中次呆木，黃豆油廠揀巧拾取，汕頭泉州不動，形入疲途，微微下跌，赤豆再跌一二千元，紅糧酒坊去胃，動而不旺，產地以運轍費用加高，客方堅不肯脫，價格上升三五百元，苞米貨稀，盤挺三五百元，麩皮回小百元，豆餅汕厦交易不多，生仁隨到隨銷，高次彷彿，惟中關零化轉淸，見升一二千元，芝蔴來貨稀少，廣帮閒津，價漲二三千元，油價仍然挺秀。</p>

<h3>平價粉開始配給　非會員向隅滋事</h3>

<h3>紗市好轉　配紗五千六百件　複製品不夠成本前途黯淡　黑市漸消滅由於供給較充</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市益臻安定，各廠配給額子，源源供售，頗爲熱鬧，同行承購亦極踴躍，然皆期貨棧單，殊不足以饜客帮需要，故市上現貨價高於公定價十萬至二十萬，然求現者仍樂於接受，皆實際銷路也，二十支各牌的較上週末好三四萬，特雙馬復升至二百十四萬，四十支雙綫去化較滯，價無榮辱</p>
<p>配紗細數</p>
<p>六區棉紡公會第三期第一次配紗，於昨日下午四時，以各紗廠撥配彙總表，交與棉紗複製品公會配紗委員會，其內容計，六支五七件，十支五〇〇件，十二支一〇件，十六支五六一件，二十支三，一四二件，二十三支一五件，卅二支四八四件，卅二支雙股一三〇件，四十支六一件，四十二支雙股四三〇件，六十支雙股一二件，六四支雙股一〇件，八十支雙股一〇件，八十支六股四件二五，以上共計五，六二六件二五。核與棉紗複配會所需要者，十六支以下之粗紗數量，超過頗巨，而四十二支雙股及卅二支雙股等，則短缺甚多，承辦當局頗感棘手，惟廿支大路貨，尚能接近，據棉紗複配會透露消息</p>
<p>紡建配貨</p>
<p>其中紡建所出者，爲二十支四〇〇件，卅二支三一〇件，卅二支雙股一〇〇件，四十二支雙股四〇〇件，六十支雙股十二件，八十支雙股一〇件，八〇支六股四件二五。其貨品較爲合用，其配售價，仍以二十支一百七十五萬爲標準，粗紗細紗等各支配價，則照紡管會前定之價格計算，複製品各業公會，此次分配標準，仍照第一次之底册辦理，未曾參加谷廠，將俟下次承配，複配會因上次配紗，就紗廠來貨，不論支數粗細，一律配搭，認爲欠妥。</p>
<p>粗紗酌退</p>
<p>決定將不合用之十支紗及十二支紗，酌量退還，據複配會主任潘士浩氏談，當此生產不足時期，各複製廠家，應酌量變通，一同時希望紗廠搭配之時，亦能顧全實用上之困難，此次一部份退貨，實出於萬不得已云，潘氏並指陳目下市面不振，布疋及多種棉紗複製品之售價，巳在成本之下，如天氣不轉涼，銀根不轉鬆，複製品業將有不少廠家停工，此次配紗，當不致如上次之踴躍，潘氏對於近日紗廠之照配價直接開貨，及紗市塲黑市之漸臻消滅，表示欣慰。</p>
<p>紗價看小</p>
<p>氏且預料紗價有再小之可能，對於同業表示，不必搶先爭配，據棉紗複製品工業有地位之人觀察，近來紗價之小，實出於配紗之後，各廠無需再向黑市淘貨，實用之减少，亦爲不可否認之事實云。</p>
<p>複配會系統下之六個同業公會，昨晚已根據紗廠來單，就公會爲單位分配完竣，茲探錄其細數如次。</p>
<p>各業配數</p>
<p>一，毛巾被毯業：計十六支紗二百十件，二十支紗一百三十六件，三十二支紗三十件，四十二支雙股九件，二，內衣織造業計二十支紗三〇二件，三二支紗七十六件，四十支紗七件，三，手帕織造業計三十二支十七件，四十支十二件，八十支雙股一件，四，手工棉織工業計十六支三十件，二十支一五二件，三十二支十件，四十支三件，四十二支雙股十九件，五針織工業計十二支紗十件，十六支紗二四〇件，二〇支紗一一八件，三十二支雙股八十件，四〇支二七件，四十二支雙股一〇二件，六十支雙股十二件，六四支雙股十件，八十支雙股九件，六，機器染織業計十六支八一件，二十支二，四四九件，三十二支二七一件，三十二支雙股五〇件，四十支一三二件，四二支雙股三〇〇件，八〇支六股四件，二五，至其中之十支紗，因不合實用，尙未分配。</p>
<p>布價又小</p>
<p>布市仍未見好轉，交易依然淸淡，價又軋小一二千元，週六紡建所開十二磅龍頭細布，最間喊價僅七萬八千元，現貨則爲八萬元，本街實銷寥寥，一般實用戶亦存觀望，天時如不轉冷，布市殊難起色。</p>
<h3>便交傳將實行　華股市況輕快</h3>
<p>華股昨上塲仍感經濟恐慌，殘多有售而再低，後以便交日內即將實行，塲外對敲空方亟補，十再扳高，午刻起形成軋空，晨初開出未見有利，形勢除勤興外，都吿小挫，開後即有殘多了結，無精打彩下，突起慘跌，永紗見六一三元，美亞二六八〇元，信和二五三元，景福一九〇元，新光二〇五元，勤興一三五元後，空方有補，加之一七六號一再吸納，得以轉定，後以八九號一八九號一五四號等亦陸續吸收，形勢回昂，十時半後塲內盛傳開拍遞延交割，即日即可公佈，日內實行之訊，人心轉俏，塲外了結交易，以軋空居大宗，於是買氣更盛，一再盤上，午刻均漲至高價，始有獲利供源而轉盤，較上週六熱股計永紗升百分之三，信和好半成强，美亞景福新光各好百分之八，勤興以價賤獨升百分之九，冷股大通榮豐火柴新亞麗安景綸內衣無甚榮辱，餘者都漲半成至一成，午後上塲續俏，但經套利者逢高出籠後，即吿回平，於是一般有力之檯而帮若八九號一七六號等，咸加壓力，勢復轉疲，惟逢低形成拉鋸，結果較上週六熱股計永紗微升，信和升百分之四，美亞景福新光勤興各漲半成光景，冷股中紡升一成不到，華豐內衣永公統益各好半成光景，餘者均乏特變，成交交一三七四萬股，塲外各股尙形平和。</p>
<p>外股買方各擇其資格在港有上塲希望者進取，以致各股稍有差度，初平繼俏，結果較上週六計業廣微降，餘者各漲半成至一成不等。</p>
<h3>稅務署取締漏稅私菸　管理手工卷菸廠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部稅務署頃以全國各地手工捲菸廠紛紛設立，惟多不能按照規定納稅，故手工捲菸之私貨，充溢各處。不特影響國家稅收，且有碍正當菸廠之利益。故特頒行管理手工捲菸廠辦法，令各地貨物稅局執行。凡手工捲菸廠戶，應先依公司法集資組設公司，置備木機或小型鐵機，申請稅務署登記，不能組設公司者，應先依合作社法組設手工捲菸業生產運銷合作社，申請稅務署登記，原有家庭經營之手工捲烟戶，暫准申請該管貨物稅局臨時登記，登記時間以三個月爲限，臨時登記之手工捲烟戶所製捲烟不用牌名商標，但應於烟枝上印明「某地某某記」之標識，幷限當地行銷，不許運銷外埠，有效期間以一年爲限，逾期非組織公司或合作社，不得再行製烟出售，每月製烟數量手工捲烟廠二十五萬支，手工捲烟戶五萬支，採用土製捲烟用紙者，應先檢樣送請稅務署核准，暫時試用，其購用舶來捲烟用紙者，應依照捲烟用紙購運規則之規定辦理。已製成之手工捲烟，如不裝箱者准按條（五百枝）完稅，貼花出廠，已貼條花之廠製手工捲烟，如擬裝入整箱運銷，應臨時報請稅務機關査騐後，於箱上加貼査騐花貨證明單方准起運，俟到達指銷地點後，並應報請當地稅務機關，將該項査騐花貨證明單逐箱剷除，同時規定手工捲烟製造商，應首行設法購辦機器，改用機製，該管貨物稅機關應隨時督促辦理。</p>
<h3>中信繼續配售　人絲黑市消沉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局昨日繼續開售人造絲，一二〇有光金三馬掛牌價，仍爲二百七十八萬元。絲織業公會申謂開絲者，共計二百廿三家，申請總額，達四百六十五箱，惟迄昨晚爲止，核准數額尙未定奪。</p>
<p>昨日一二〇號天橋有光人造絲上午喊三百四十五萬至五十萬元，並無成交，新貨喊價三百〇五萬元，下午有人過問，遂又喊大，老貨五十五萬元，新貨十萬元，均較上週末大起五六萬元之譜，一二〇號天橋半光上下只喊二百九十五萬元，下午喊十萬元，終與上週平，一五〇號有光及七五號半光上午略疲，下午回好，價與上週末均無上落。</p>
<h3>最近發明之　人造紡織原料</h3>
<p>本埠英商卜內門之英國母公司，最近與曼却斯特城之印花工業協會聯合發表在人造纖維方面之重要發明。此新品取名Terylen乃印花工業專家，於戰時統力研究之結晶。現尙在硏討中，與已有之各種天然及人造纖維大不相同。其特點計：（一）堅韌性特强，（二）於高熱烈光下，與他種纖維相較，難起變化，（三）機器及人工紡織極易，（四）其粗細長短，在廣大之範圍內，可隨意製造，（五）其纖維性質，亦能隨製法而不同，以適合於各種需要。織成衣料，在洗汰燙熨時，不必如平常衣料之須十分小心。</p>
<h3>本票匯票劃綫　財部認爲不合</h3>
<p>銀行錢莊所開本票匯票，依照以往銀錢兩業習慣，均採用劃錢或特別劃綫辦法，並限於銀行錢莊支付，最近財政部解釋，因票據法上，並無此項規定，且照票據法第九條載明，票據上記載本法所不規定之事項者，不生票據上之效力，國家行局以原來此項習慣行之已久，一但變更，至感困難，各行局有關業務人員，均於昨日下午三時假交通銀行三樓會議室，開會硏究辦法，歷一小時餘，硏討結果，將以一部份本票匯票，改用本行支票，並應用票據法禁止讓之背書辦法以資補救云。</p>
<h3>國際蠶絲　紡織公司近況</h3>
<p>國際蠶絲紡織公司，專營經銷國內外絲綢業務，尤以出品經銷印度絲綢爲大宗，該公司自董事長楊蔭溥總經理張禹聲主持以來，業務日見發達，近因擴充業務，原址貴州路不數應用，遷至漢口路　伏大樓三十四號新址辦公云。</p>
<h3>金市買戶踴躍　外幣美升港跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨人心復榮，晨開二三三萬五，上堪時尙呈平穩，在二三三萬光景，後以人心復有趨榮觀念，逐漸形成求過於供，盤旋而升，十時後央行以二三四萬二五之價，配給三〇〇條，央行供源不暢，買戶更殷，近午曾回漲到二三六萬以上，始稍見定，午刻在二三五萬五光景掙扎，午後隔日交割又被哄高至二三七萬五左右，結果較上週六漲四萬，飾金掛高至廿五萬元，紋銀平而銀元稍昂，暗拆銀根尙平，息價在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣初疲後穩，美鈔晨初四〇五〇元左右，後隨金市向榮，近午升至四一五〇元，較上週六續有微升，港票被電匯所帶小，缺少銷路，曾見低八七〇元左右而後吿定，結果較上週六再跌十元，港匯因申電報升一一四元二五，加之本市去路沉寂，昨八七〇元有售少求，印匯一〇六五元有供，英匯一四一〇〇亦乏維持，成交不多，美匯牌價未更，對做却</p>

<h3>簡化現行教育法規　教部擬增進行政效率　已由參事處主持進行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕敎部以戰前及在戰期內所頒布各種敎育法規甚多，勝利後，對於教育復員及新興敎育事業所製訂公布之章則亦夥，一時檢査非易，現擬將所有現行敎育法規，汰繁就精，力求簡化，使檢査方面，得以經濟時間，從而增進敎靑行政效率，聞已由教部參事處主持，商請各司處專門指定負責人員參加，以便每日撥出一小部辦公時間，會商整理，將現行各級敎育法規，盡量删訂，予以簡化。</p>
<h3>京市教育人員擴大紀念週　朱教長蒞臨訓話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕南京市敎育局，於三日上午九時，假大華大戲院，舉行南京市敎育工作人員擴大紀念週，敦請朱敎長，與馬市長，出席訓話，到京市中小學敎職員曁社教機關工作人員一千餘人，行禮如儀。先由市敎育局長報吿，謂舉行擴大紀念週，敦請敎界名人訓話，此爲首决，以後仍不時舉行。致詞畢，朱敎長登台訓話，先謂從事敎員人員生活之淸苦，在歐美各國皆然，惟中國勝利復員之際，因種種關係，民生元氣未復，國家經費支出浩繁，敎育部分所得有限，未能達到標準，因此敎育人員待遇，更見菲薄，此後當隨政局之安定，有以改善而增進之。繼謂學風太不够理想，亟應整頓。在敎師方面，勿以敎授書本爲盡責，要充實敎學內容，使學生感覺興趣，訓導學生，尤貴以身作則。在學生方面，宜力改囂張之習，要有尊師重道心理。而行政方面，經濟要絕對公開，所謂新生活運動最低限度之整齊淸潔，務須做到，因戰事關係，國立學校學生，多屬公費待遇，而有些學生，認爲事事皆是應當享受，甚且爲種種求全之責備，未免不仰體公家艱難，過於自以爲是。敎育本屬淸苦事業，惟精神有所安慰，希望從事敎育工作人員，共同奮勉。繼馬市長訓話：略謂市府全部捐稅收入四萬萬，而敎育開支已近五萬萬，入不敷出。最後馬敎育局長報吿：近來京市已增校添級，及小學校舍數處，正在建築中。至十一時半散會。</p>

<h3>我留英學生李莊孚　生物化學研究成功　解決數世紀來迄未解決之問題</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦四日電〕中英文化敎育基金董事會，派往英國之中國留學生李莊孚（譯音），刻在英國伯明翰大學賀華斯敎授指導之下，從事硏究生物化學。據傳渠已解決一數世紀來迄未解決之問題。按該生係湖南湘雅醫學院出身，據稱渠已能使細胞核酸結晶，因此，此複雜之物質，即可便於分析，而發現其組成各部之反應。此對生物化學之硏究，將極關重要，蓋因細胞核酸與蛋白質結合後，組成細胞核蛋白質，對動植物之繁殖及生長，均有直接之影響。總而言之，細胞核蛋白質，乃孟德爾遺傳定律中細胞內染色體或遺傳因子之化學上表現。而在生物科學上孟德爾定律乃目前唯一準確之定律，解釋父母特性如何遺傳至後代，惟迄今尙無法以物理公式表達之。在八十年前，已有人擬解答此種問題，惟迄未獲得解決。此蓋因迄今尙無法隔離之，使成爲純粹之結晶體之故。在五月以前，李君將細胞核酸，變成結晶體，試驗成功。渠第二步，將隔離此種分子，再硏討各單位，究係何物，然後始可尋出各組成分子與各種染色體之關係。此項發現之價値，可能無法估計。今後可能發現維持及加强所需特性，以及除去某極染色體衰弱之方法。此種硏究範圍，實充滿希望。</p>
<h3>交通銀行舉辦學費儲蓄　解除家長籌措困難</h3>
<p>本市交通銀行，以敎育爲立國之本，而現時學校收費昂貴，一般家長一時欲籌集如許鉅款，輒感困難，因而坐令子女失學者有之，引爲憾事。該行爲鼓勵子女進學，减輕家長一時籌措學費困難起見，特創辦「個人敎育費」及「集團敎育費」兩秘儲蓄存款。此兩種儲蓄存款性質相同，前者係個人爲子女存儲而設，後者係便利團體員工爲子女存儲而設，兩者均以子女現時在中學大學肄業者爲限，但子女在中大學有數人者，亦可認儲數份。</p>
<p>兩種儲蓄</p>
<p>其辦法：個人與團體兩種儲蓄存款，均係按月存儲。存額分每月三萬元，四萬元，五萬元，六萬元，七萬元，八萬元，九萬元，十萬元，八種。個人儲蓄，可由存款人直接向銀行，塡具開戶申請書，開戶存儲。集團儲蓄，可由服務於機關工廠商號之員工，商請服務機關之同意，以團體爲單位，由團體負責在認儲員工薪津內按月提扣，送交銀行開戶存儲。</p>
<p>五倍借款</p>
<p>此兩種儲蓄存款，存滿兩個月，即可檢同子女在肆業證件，塡具借款申請書，向該行申借學費借款，借款數額爲其每月存儲額之五倍，例如每月存儲三萬元者，按五倍計，可借十五萬元，每月存儲十萬元者，可借五十萬元。</p>
<p>三分欠息</p>
<p>無論個人團體，其存息均爲一分五厘，借款利息則爲三分，與市面借款利息相差極遠。存款期限爲六個月，借款期限爲四個月。存滿兩個月借款故存借款項均係同時到期。到期時由銀行將存借本息分別結算，餘款付還存款人或認儲團體。此兩種儲　存款，因係存滿兩個月始能借款，故存儲人應事先預計子女所在學校開學前兩個月，即行存儲，以便届時應用，如預籌明年春季學校費用，則十一月間即須開始存儲。據悉：該行分支機構遍佈全國，無論子女在何處求學，家長存儲支用，均極便利，預料存儲者必甚踴躍。</p>

<h3>關懷主席行止的浙江</h3>
<p>— 十月卅一日杭州訊　本報特派員儲裕</p>
<p>十月卅一日是國民政府蔣主席的誕日，這位豐功偉績的巨人，因爲日理萬機，在這抗戰的八年中以及戰後的一年來，除了回到杭州來一次，沒有回到家鄉奉化去過。這個十年來沒有回到家鄉去的偉人，—爲了世界，爲了國家，担當起無比的鉅任，艱苦備嘗，辛勞煩怨，均所不顧的蔣主席，他們是多麽熱烈地期望着想見見他，甚至抱抱他，親親他，爲的是：他增益了故鄉的殊榮，添加了國家民族的光彩。　很多國內的報紙上，都滿以爲　將主席在這一次的誕日，一定會的到家鄕去的。所以在寸月一開始，大家汴意這個消息，蔣主席由廬山娥江西南昌，新聞記者都以全副精神來重視他的行止。十月九日，正是他農曆的壽辰，在九日以前會有很多報紙　　　將主席要返奉化的，甚至有的已派記者到奉化去等候，有的更肯定地說：「蔣主席將於南昌巡視後去奉化溪口。」但是在他自己的想法，國家民族的事要比私人的事更要緊，他已決定不返溪口了，飛到南京去，到南京處理國事去了。那一天，他生活簡單到比一般人更其簡單，他仍舊在官邸辦公，沒有特殊的舉動，他親自出席主持國防最高委員會二〇二次的例會。這農曆的壽誕日子，就這樣悄悄地過去了。還有一個國曆壽誕的日子。舉國的人民，爲了表示愛戴蔣主席的熱忱，雖然在主席一再誥誡力戒舖張的情况之下，但是由於一種衷心的擁護，仍一售有‘一番籌備，他們多多少少體會出主席公而忘私的精神，所以廣泛的激起獻校祝壽運動。尤其是浙江省，除了獻校以外，還有很多在歡的活動。這時重又傳出有蔣主席返歸奉化避壽的呼聲。全國新聞界重又注意奉化的消息。事前有很多的傳說：一說主席將　台灣逕飛奉化，一說主席將返京後飛杭再飛寗波轉奉化，一說主席飛滬再飛寗波逕轉溪口。</p>
<p>紛紜的推測</p>
<p>浙江的報紙，幾乎每天都以主席的行蹤作爲重要的標題，允其關於來浙與吾的消息。我們可以列舉出來的，中央社預備帶一電台赴溪口，東南日報也有此準備，浙江日報已派定了適當的人選，浙江商報已取得了寗波商會的連絡，正報的寗波通訊日日有揭載，大同日報，靑年日報，民報，西湖夜報都特別注意，上海方面各報也密切指派記者爭取此項消息，新聞報在月初就成立了杭州辦事處，大公報加强了寗波方面的連絡，文匯報月初派來了駐杭特派員，中央日報也有專門通訊的負責人，即南京中央日報，於隨同司徒大使來杭的特派訊者之便，也有相當佈置。到十月二十一日主席飛台以後，大家都感着緊張起來。新聞界有人主張先派人到寗波，有人主張等蔣主席飛回第一地後再定辦法。到二十八日這一天，浙江的報紙，顯有兩個不同的預測；一爲蔣主席於二十七日自合返滬時，途中繞道經過送口，於其上空低飛兩圈，表示戀念之音，惟因南京政治空氣日見開朗，無暇返里，短期內不致返歸溪口。一爲蔣主席即將飛返寗波轉往溪口慶壽。二十九日預測蔣主席返溪口的，反說不去奉化，而預測不去溪口的反說將飛往奉化避壽。上海各報也有兩種不同的猜測。三十日的消息更緊張了。有說還是要到浙江來，有說到某地去避壽。記者檢査自己預置的新聞網，憑着各方的情報以及蔣主席一貫的公而忘私的精神，覺得他來浙江的成份還是很少，於是上海報上仍有兩種相反的觀點：一則爲本報揭載的緩期返里，一則爲×報上揭載的返奉避壽。當晚傳說更粉紜，有的說三十一日晨即偕馬歇爾夫婦飛奉化，蔣經國氏已先飛奉化佈置，有的說蔣經國夫人去南京，蔣主席將在南京郊外避壽。有的說蔣主席可能乘軍艦赴寗波轉奉化，有的說蔣主席將在海上避籌，有的說，蔣主席將偕馬歇爾元帥赴無錫避壽。到卅一日的報上消息，都仍無法刋出其確實行止，有的甚至把兩種相反的消息都刋出，任憑讀者去揣索。這種種當然是代表現時代新聞事業競賽的激烈，但是爭取新聞的價値是在大衆的重要需求趣味上，足見蔣主席的行止是舉國人民甚至全世界人民所關懷的啊！</p>
<p>狂歡的浪潮</p>
<p>十月卅一日這一天，全國人民狂歡了，身在主席故鄉浙江的我尤其感得親切，這素來靜靜的杭州，也泛起狂歡的浪潮。這一天，大家起來得特別早，國旗老早掛出了，家家懸燈結彩，設在各處的壽堂，門前都有車水馬龍之感，簽名祝壽的灑金紅箋，一張又一張的更易，酒館裏自動减價，麵店裏生意特別好，各家商舖　動貼出招貼：慶祝主席六十華誕各貨一律九折。即平素數度請求開放均不予理會的舞禁這三天也是開放了全浙江有好幾個地方都舉行體育運動會，來慶祝壽誕。這許多活動都在盡量想汰使他如何能够意義更深長一些，留在人們的腦筋裏更久遠一些。有人說：如果蔣主席不再四誥誡力戒舖張的話，那麽這古老的中國在這一天眞要發在了。又有人說：如果蔣主席這一天在家鄉度壽，浙江的人民眞不知要如何的興奮呢！</p>
<p>如果要蔣主席回到浙江來度壽，只要眞正實現了和平團結獨立的新中國。我們如果相信有這麼一天，那麼這一天就會到來的啊！</p>
<h3>臺灣肥料配售</h3>
<p>據台灣肥料公司總經理湯元吉談：所有公司五個廠，全部發揮最高的生產能力，年產五萬多噸，僅及全省需要　六十實　的十分之一。本年度除由肥料公司供給外，一部仰仗於　後救濟分　台灣分署的配給。該署第一次由美運台化肥三千噸，由錢分署長親赴高雄監督時，晨民皆列隊歡迎，這充分說明化學肥料實是台灣農作的必需品，普遍的熟練的使用，帮助了農業增產，與內地農民的曲解化肥的功效，誠不可圓日而語。（本報特派員江　　寄）</p>

<h3>湖南鑛業的危機</h3>
<p>— 十月六日長沙航訊　本報特派員高元禮</p>
<p>湖南的鑛業，遭受了從來米有的不景氣，一直是在沒落的過程裏。不景氣的原因，第一是長期戰事的影響，第二是政府八年統制的結果，於是有名的鑛山，什九都陷於停頓的狀態，雖然戰事業已結束，統制政策亦於最近經政府明令撤銷，然而在惡性通貨膨脹的今日，復興還是渺茫的事。</p>
<p>官營的鑛山</p>
<p>湖南的金屬鑛和非金屬鑛，在國內市塲和國際市塲上，都極負盛名，如鎢綈錫汞雄黃等，在海關貿易册上均極重要，而其中汞的產量，不但極大，且是遠東唯一的生產地。　這些鑛產主要都是官營，由建設　主持的佔最大多數，但其中如銻鑛及非金屬鑛煤礦等，亦有少數民營，但是數量極少，而資力也不够雄厚。</p>
<p>官營鑛山中，煤礦計有四處，即醴陵煤礦，祁陽觀音灘煤礦，湘潭雲湖橋煤礦，寗鄕淸溪煤礦，已有多年歷史，觀音灘煤田和醴陵石門口煤田，蘊藏都極豐富，戰爭期中，幾全部供給粤漢和湘桂兩路，因銷路有限，沒有大的發展，湖南倫陷時期，以上四鑛全部停頓，有一部份設備受到鉅大的破壞，復員後，長漢水運恢復，雖然粤漢湘桂兩路的需要，因復路工程的關係，還不會立時增加，但武漢三鐘的煤荒，使湖南的煤業立時呈現繁榮，於是建設廳着手緊急復工，第一步修復重要鑛井，第二步恢復全部設備，但主要的工作，還是抽水，使其能立即恢復生產，緊急復工的工作，進行極爲順利，而武漢煤價的高漲，也是促進其順利完成原因之一，僅僅三個月的時間，四鑛產煤的數量，達到每月一萬噸，民營各鑛情形，亦復如此，市塲需求迫切，自然引起繁榮，而煤焦管理處撤，銷以後人民能自由營運，不再受到限制，這於湖南煤業的前途，是很有帮助，可是湖南煤業是否能，永遠繁榮下去呢，這倒頗値研究。不論是民營和省營的煤鑛，現在所感到的困難，計有兩項，一，設備不够，二，運輸不便，設備的補充，目前毫無頭緒，建廳雖然把所需要的機器請求聯求供給，但顯然的目前是談不到，運輸問題呢，也是同探嚴重，生產是增加了，但能聽任堆在鑛山裏嗎，各鑛和湘江的距離，相當的遠，輕便鐵道一直沒有敷設，現在祇靠人力和極少數淺水船隻，而湘江的運轍量在船隻缺乏的今日也不會馬上改善，因此省民營各鑛，都對此兩項問題頗爲焦慮，祗希望政府能設法改善，否則目前的繁榮，謹防是曇花一現。</p>
<p>恢復雄黃礦</p>
<p>建設廳在煤礦以外，積極着手恢復的，是慈利石門間的雄黃鑛，雄黃即端節所服雄黃酒之雄黃，其用途除一般民間用作殺虫劑外，主要行銷東北及南洋各地，東北各省用作殺虫劑肥田粉，南洋各地則建築房屋必於底層舖洒雄黃，以防毒虫，而海上船舶，必於船壳上塗佈雄黃，以防海螺寄生，阻碍航行，用途極爲慶泛，慈石雄黃鑛，停辦業已多年，復員後建廳即與民間合作開採，官商各投資五千萬，於去年年底興工，預計本年內生產雄黃一萬担。本屆開採，預定三年，則總生產量可達三萬担，收入頗有可觀，這是省營　業最獲利的一種。</p>
<p>鉛鋅銀鑛產</p>
<p>除了以上兩項的非金屬鑛產，省營的金屬鑛，規模最大的要算常寗水口山鉛鋅鑛，鉛鋅是共生鑛物，二者常生於一處，而鉛鑛又常含銀質，故常稱爲鉛鋅銀鑛，常寗水口山鑛塲，在國內頗負盛名，建設應在該處設有鑛局，規模宏大，設備完善，開採迄今，已有四十餘年歷史，出產鑛砂，合計不下一百五十萬噸以上，開採方法極爲新式，設有輕便鐵道，運輸鑛砂，又有新式冶煉廠，從事提煉，此鑛　鑛質極優，據分析結果，鉛鑛砂內含鉛百分之六十六，含鋅百分之九，每噸鑛砂含銀八至十兩，至於鋅鑛砂內含鋅百分之四十六七，含鉛百分之五至百分之九，最盛時期，鑛工人數達五六千名，每日出鑛砂一百五十噸，煉鉛二十噸煉鋅四十噸，煉銀五百市兩，近年因海運斷絕，無法外銷，產量大減，湖南淪陷時，該鑛爲敵人佔領，敵人極爲重視，原有鳩工復開之意，經我方派機將該鑛設備悉予炸毁，故勝利後無法復工，現僅設一保管處負責保管殘餘器材，但據建廳負責人表示，該鑛經多年開採，鑛床業已貧弱，是否尙有開採價値，頗値考慮，將來俟重新鑽探後，方能決定是否復工，但這確是湖南最大的損失。</p>
<p>錫　銻汞鑛</p>
<p>錫鎢銻汞等鑛爲戰時政府統制之鑛產，幾皆爲出口貨，但因統制結果，各鑛幾乎全告停頓，錫產於江華臨武等地，爲軍需工業所必需，湖南錫鑛，居全國第三位，而鑛又分爲砂錫岩錫兩種，湖南之江華道縣寗遠三縣境內，爲全國砂錫乏主要產區，儲量雖不多，但最盛時每年出產純錫的一萬餘市担，近年受政府管制，往返核價，需時二三月，以致官價與成本相差極遠，且以運輸不便，於是各鑛相繼倒閉，工人失業者達一兩萬人近經政府將統制取消，但欲圖恢後亦非短期可復舊觀。</p>
<p>銻市之權威</p>
<p>至於銻鑛，不但是湖南特產，且有左右全世界銻市之　威，中國銻產佔此總產量百分之八十左右，而湖南所產又的佔全國產量百分之九十以上，故爲極有希望于鑛鑛產，湖南銻鑛，分佈於新化，益陽，安化，邵陽，湘鄉，武岡，新寗，東安，沅陵，辰豁等十八縣，而以新華之錫鑛山爲最著名，錫鑛山之銻鑛，爲輝銻鑛，含銻成分爲百分之五十以上，第一次歐戰期間，該地開採銻鑛之公司及煉冶廠達百餘家之多，鑛工逾萬人，每月出產純銻多至二萬餘噸近年來該地銻鑛業已衰落，但每月仍可出產純銻的一二千噸，大部份均運滬港轉銷外洋，戰時統制輸出由政府收購。鑛商頗感無利可圖上月間各鑛代表在長沙集會，要求政府採取辦法，增加收購價格，近經資源委員會核准純銻收價於原定每公噸三十二萬元外，再加給補助費一十八萬元，共爲五十萬元，然仍與滬上黑市價格相　極遠，鑛商認爲戰時統制政策，已成過去，政府實應取消管制，俾得自由發　不應再與民爭利，故擬於最近向政府陳訴，務求達到取消統制目的。</p>
<p>以上所舉各　，是湖南最大及最有希應之　塲，其情形旣如此惡劣，其他如金鑛錳鑛鎢　等亦復相同，推其原因，固由於戰事影響，但政府統制之未臻合理，亦不無因，此時欲求發展，固爲事實所限制，但如何培養元氣，使不致於全部陷於停頓倒閉，則實應於此時加以努力，　民間資本有限，工鑛貸款，右其名而無其實，亦爲湖南鑛商最苦悶的問題。</p>
<h3>袞袞議員　滔滔雄辯　京臨參會席上一臠</h3>
<p>— 十月廿九日南京訊　本報特約者丁匡華</p>
<p>京市參議員民選過去了，緊接選舉之後，最後一次的臨時參議會，於廿五日在南京市政府大禮堂揭幕。濟濟多士，會於一堂。馬市長在大會開幕後更以善意的語氣，給予未當選的他（她）們以莫大刺激。他說：「市府頗望諸會員於此次競選中全部當選，但結果只有百分之六十，至表遺憾。惟望此後大家都能一起參加建設工作」。道一來百分之四十的落選先生們，認爲這是一個公開的侮辱，面子上大有關係，於是「借題發揮」，市政批評便頓時形成了中心問題。</p>
<p>開放舞禁激辯後　原議仍維持</p>
<p>南京禁舞，可以說，是中央日報放的大砲，那時正是執行節的的時候。馬市長怕攻擊，祇得毅然決然的禁了。舞商們飯碗打碎，那肯干休，在臨參會期中，曾作數度請求開禁，臨參會爲難了，一面要代表民意，一面要顧及政府揹施，當然不好作硬性決定，祇認爲舞總是娛樂之一，假如在「管而不禁，樂而不淫」，的原則之下，未嘗不可，但經舞商幾度奔走之餘，仍然是一執法如山」，不准所請。這一次臨參會召開，舞商認爲機會不可錯過於是再來一次請求。臨參會付諸大會討論時，却引起熱烈激辯。黎劍虹參議員說：「就舞女生活問題着想，禁舞之先，應使舞女有一正當出路，跳舞本身并無罪惡，正當娛樂應該提倡的」，莊茂如參議員則以跳舞之弊甚多。主張嚴厲禁止。黃鹿明參議員說：跳舞在歐美是一種禮節，本來是很好的，只是到了中國就變持了，所以跳舞以不禁爲原則，但應嚴加管理。」張文伯參議員正經地說：「本會決議禁舞，爲饗應一國策之舉，蓋以今日　　滿目，吾人不可過分荒淫也。」其他王一繹齋參議員就商業立塲，同情舞廳商人之請，主張不禁而管。參議員孫玉琳謂如禁舞是法令問題，應請市府報吿法令之根據。議論紛紛，莫衷一是。陳劍如局長以主管身份卻發表其「殿後」談話。他說：「市政府之禁舞，係」准臨參會之決議，當時南京舞女太多，交際太濫，實有影響風化，輿論極爲責難，至舞商等以市府旣發營業證於先，不應禁之於後云云，依法凡一種新法令確定後，舊法令自然無效，故市府之執行禁舞，自然合法。」討論至此，主席乃提付表決，結果維持原議，「嚴禁舞廳。」主張跳舞的議員先生們，徒呼負負，到此時也是像舞女們冷冰冰地無可奈何了。</p>

<p>首都電廠的發電鍋爐，頗不堪應用，爲應付需要，於十月份起，加以修葺，在修理期內，祇好採用分區停電。實施以來，未能得到市民滿意，首都電廠陸廠長法曾，到臨參會來報吿業務。議員先生們那首放過他，孫玉琳參議員口頭詢問，語語逼眞，他說：「分這停電，爲何不公平。黃浦路與　家灣不停電，尙有理由可說，因前者爲國防部所在之地，有關國防，未便停電。後者爲外交部所在之地，有關外交，米便停電。而山西路一帶，旣非有關國防，又非有關外交，何以不列入停電範圍之內？是不是該處爲要人住宅，未便停電。請陸廠長答復！」此時陸廠長而紅耳赤，極爲窘迫，呑呑吐吐的應聲答稱：「關於道一點，我不便答復，山西路一帶住的什麼人。是大家都知道的。……議員先生對這種答復極不滿意，孫玉琳，莊茂如，王國鴻，楊德文緊接追問究竟，陸廠長祇得說：「你們大家不要逼我，都是姓陸的一個人的錯誤，隨便你們處罰我，都可以。」言下不勝凄凉，結果終於不了了之。</p>

<h3>慎重你的初戀</h3>
<p>— 納雅</p>
<p>生長在這新時代的洪流裏，每一個女子，不見得會甘心再受舊制度的支配——不自由的婚姻了吧？而新女性們現在的要求是基麼呢？回答是爽快的一句話：自由的戀愛，每一個少女定有戀愛的要求！</p>
<p>誰都不能否認，小姐們與男子一樣有戀愛的要求，在發育成熟時間，必然地，要求一個戀愛的對象。那時候或會不問一切地去找一個對象，並不十分注意對方是怎樣的人，結識了，祇要對方給予她一點歡心，如看電影，遊公園等，再三的請客，使她覺得對方似乎體貼人微而似乎愛上了她，因爲少女時期具着幼稚的也可以說是天眞的心靈；並不懂這惡社會的眞相的。</p>
<p>「愛人」有了，雖然他並無怎大的才能，但因多請客和體貼人微，就不忍心再丟掉他，這種初戀往往是錯誤的，結果乃走入了戀愛的墳墓。</p>
<p>如果眞是這樣，（社會上見得很多）那末，她的一生是會被埋葬的，婚後生活旣多半不幸福，而她的應有的許多新機會，也從此放棄了。</p>
<p>那麽應該怎麽樣才有眞正的戀愛呢？怎樣才能實現她將來的希望呢？怎樣才有眞正的幸福呢？這一連串問題在天眞的小姐或許要問吧？那麽，現在我簡單地答覆你：</p>
<p>（一）選擇對象不可爲一時需求而馬虎，應該從嚴選擇，如這人的人格怎樣，將來的企望如吾相同？如吾有眞誠的友誼？</p>
<p>（二）戀愛並不是嬉戲，可以用請客游戲的方式來增加友情，如果以爲這樣的態度是對的，那麽將來一定不是「幸福」而是「墳墓」。</p>
<p>（三）在戀愛的時間，雙方均應有本性眞誠的心，來彼此觀察如吾適合，不要虛飾表面，如果現在虛飾，將來婚後「現原形」，是最苦惱的事。情感分歧，就失去幸福了！</p>
<p>我不多嚕囌，小姐們，你們要注意什麼是眞，善，美，而愼重你的初戀的要求！</p>
<h3>當孩子生病時</h3>
<p>— 楊永彰</p>
<p>（一）孩子眞會生病</p>
<p>多吃幾塊奶油蛋糕竟會引起孩子的消化不良症；一根捧冰在某種情形下，也能使小孩發生劇烈的肚痛腹瀉；在炎熱的夏天，好久得不到甘露，忽然降了一陣大雨，當別人正在額手稱慶滿以爲天氣可以比較凉爽的時候，孩予却因爲忘記多穿一件衣服而傷了風，於是鼻涕啊咳嗽啊，發熱啊，足足使他睡在牀上三四天。</p>
<p>好好放在桌上的一只玻璃杯，被五六歲的孩子抓在手裏，把它當作玩具，可是一不小心，孩子跌倒在地，玻璃杯碎了，他的頭也碰破了。</p>
<p>根據醫學的觀點來說，孩子的罹息率及死亡率的確比成人來得高，十四歲以下的孩子，無論在身體的發育上，生理的機能上都遠遜於成人，由於抵抗力的薄弱，知識之不足，孩子總容易生病。麻疹，猩紅熱，白喉，腦膜炎等急性傳染病不知奪去了多少寳貴的小生命。其他多見的疾病像營養障碍，胃腸運和，都大大威脅着兒童們的健康。孩子大半是貪吃的，有些無知的孩子會把別人丟棄的西瓜皮，香焦皮常作山珍海味呑到肚裏去，許多莫明其妙的東西都能在孩子的嘴內找出來。「病從口入」這句話似平專對孩子說的。又傷風，咳嗽，氣管支炎，肺炎差不多每個孩子都不能避免，這是因爲孩子的呼吸器官特別脆弱的緣故，其他因意外事件而引起的病如內傷，外傷等也不能算少。</p>
<p>實在太多了，到處可以聽見人說：「張家弟弟在發痧子」，「李家妹妹在發寒熱」……總之一句話，孩子眞會生病。</p>
<p>（二）只可急不可慌</p>
<p>孩子病了怎麼辦？這是在孩子生病後立刻需要解決的問題；尤其是母親，她特別關心着她的寳貝——孩子，深恐會發生意外。這裏不是吿訴你當孩子生肺炎的時候應該這樣，患急性腸炎時理當那樣，吃什麽藥，打什麼針，因爲這根本是件不可能的事，我只提出幾點中心思想，這些是非常通俗的。</p>
<p>當孩子不幸生病時，第一不要慌，我們應當細察他的病狀，小心行事。切勿自己慌張，失去主意。許多孩子的病如果好好地加以治療和看護，未必一定沒有希望，鎭靜實在是每個母親所不可缺少的。慌張固然不必，但亦不能置之泰然，有些做父母的人根本不關心自己的孩子，一且孩子病了，他們旣不慌又不急，在無意中種下了極大的禍根，日後悔之莫及，許多急性傳染病，往往在短時期內結束了小孩的性命，所以無論傷風，咳嗽，肚痛，都不該忽略。孩子病了怎麽辦？記住，只可急不可慌。</p>
<p>（三）切勿亂用藥品</p>
<p>孩子頭痛吃些阿司匹靈當然是件好事，不過不是一切的頭痛都是阿司匹靈可以治好的。</p>
<p>現在消治龍配尼西林已經不能視爲醫生秘密的法賽了。因爲誰都知道這些藥品。有人（不是醫生）常說；「某某藥很好，給他吃一點。」其實他對某種藥根本無什麽瞭解，似懂非懂的，損失金錢是件小事，有時反能引起不良的結果，所以我以爲當孩子病了，除非你有相當的把握與經騐，絕對不要亂用藥品，使孩子吃許多寃枉苦，尤其不要看廣吿吃藥，以爲孩子咳嗽吃了一瓶止咳藥就會好，在吃藥以前最好和醫生商談，徵求他們的意思，免得損失金錢，斷送治療的機會。</p>
<p>（四）求教可靠的醫生</p>
<p>醫生是病人的保護者，孩子病了，做母親的應該找一個可靠的醫生，去求他的援助，可惜，中國的醫學委實太不景氣，有許多「醫生」和惟利是圖的商人沒有兩樣，他們學會了賺錢的方法，忘了自己崇高神聖的地位和責任，但話也得說回來，醫生中仍舊不乏抱犧牲博愛精神的人的。</p>
<p>我希望孩子病了以後，母親不要亂請醫生，許多有錢的人每以爲自己有的是錢，往往對醫生失去信仰心，那是大錯而特錯。一個有豐富知識和經騐的醫生加上了道德的修養是最合理想的，我們應該聽醫生的吩咐，照他們的話去行。</p>
<p>（五）預防勝於治療</p>
<p>西諺有云：「一啢預防勝於一磅治療，」孩子病了以後，爲父母的應該找出致病的原因來而設法除去，以免悲劇之再度發生。許多孩子的疾病是可能避免的，特別是胃腸病及呼吸病，祇要對孩子平常攝生加以注意，總有良好的效果，預防針之注射，牛痘之接種，對疾病之預防都有價值。</p>
<p>在家庭中，應該充份灌輸孩子衛生的常識，鼓勵他們去發展體育上的技能，使他們的飲食起居有一定的規則，並多與日光及新鮮空氣接觸，每日有合宜之運動及休息，有了健康的身體，對疾病的抵抗力至少可以增加了，孩子病了怎麼辦？嘿，最好還是預防，使他們不生病！</p>
<h3>病着的孩子還戀着玩具</h3>
<h3>吵架</h3>
<p>— 李瑩</p>
<p>吵架是一樁極普遍的事，朋友·父子·兄弟·夫婦都會吵架，尤其是夫婦吵架之可能性最大，爲什麼呢，待我詳細分析一下：</p>
<p>A吵架之成因</p>
<p>夫婦在人與人之間，關係最密切親近，因爲晨夕相共，以致對方的缺點。錯誤能隨時發現，在未婚或新婚時期，兩方都遷就容忍，逐漸日畏時久，所謂「日久頑生」，尤其是一方歡喜多話，性情古怪，嗜好特殊，就難免吵起來，普通如：</p>
<p>（一）夫婦間雙方發現缺點，意志不投，性情不合，互存意見，遂致吵架；</p>
<p>（二）男女一方另有所戀，不滿舊侶，借題發揮，達到其離婚的目的；</p>
<p>（三）受某種刺激或飲酒過度，神志昏迷，無理由吵鬧；</p>
<p>（四）某些人以爲這長一樁有趣的事，常常拿「吵架」來調劑——興奮夫婦間平淡枯燥生活。</p>
<p>B吵架的方式</p>
<p>吵架的方式很多，大戶人家與草屋茅舍，吵架就不同，有敎育修養和毫無知識的粗坯又兩樣，簡括之可分：</p>
<p>（一）封建禮敎下的大家庭，往往丈夫蠻强無理，妻子祇有暗暗哭泣，把所有遭遇，付之命運，這情形現在社會下漸不多見</p>
<p>（二）這是最普遍的：先是打鷄駡狗，繼則鬥嘴相爭，結果，男的外面一跑，女的回到娘家，也有態度粗猛，出手打人，二敗俱傷；</p>
<p>（三）最不好的方式，就是摔東西，譬如心愛的花瓶，石膏像，日常必須的熱水瓶，玻璃杯等，當塲怒氣衝天，擲了東西，心中舒暢一點。實在，道太不値得，今天摔了，明天去買，金錢損失，精神痛苦，何苦呢？</p>
<p>（四）等而下之，吵到「利令智昏」的當口，來一個「謀殺親夫」，也未始沒有，歷史就是證明。</p>
<p>C吵架的結果</p>
<p>吵架結果，多半和好如初，也有離婚的，可是離婚並不是一樁簡單的交易呀！夫婦間多吵一次，感情多疏遠一些。歡喜摔東西，撕衣裳的，鈔票晦氣，便宜了商店老板，倒不如乾脆撕鈔票。且吵架不能常吵，最怕吵得「皮」，以致不可收拾，我的朋友和他太太新婚時，比任何人都恩愛，後來三日一小吵，五日一大吵，到今天時時吵，刻刻吵，吃飯要吵，穿衣也吵，雙方都感痛苦，這就是吵「皮」了不當一回事。</p>
<p>D吵架的補救</p>
<p>（一）儘量避免吵架，尤其是第一次，對方在發火，自己靜一靜，忍耐一下。如果對方對，自己趕快認錯；對方錯，無理取鬧，那末，等對方火氣撒盡了，用溫和的語氣，婉轉的解釋，使對方自己覺悟自已錯，最忌是常塲開銷，各人有自尊心，而且在火燄上，火上加油，越燒越旺。你們是夫婦呀，夫婦有什麼怕羞難爲情的？如果，雙方都想一想初戀或新婚時的情景，就是鐵石心陽也不會生火吧！</p>
<p>（二）如果雙方性情實在不合，那你應該退一步想，已經結了婚，就馬馬虎虎，丈夫歡喜魚腥，而你一聞到腥味就打噁，可是你想到：這是你愛人所歡喜的東西。你就覺得腥之別有滋味了。</p>
<p>（三）事實上，夫婦是再也不能相合下去了，那男的不妨一個人到外面去做他工作，女的也單身過一個時期——一定要一個人和單身，過了幾天，男的須要妻子，女的想着丈夫，他們一定都承認，夫婦共棲的生活，比較單身孤獨的舒服，快樂和有「意思」。</p>
<p>總之，夫婦間吵架，是一樁避免不了的事，然而要在不可能中，找出可能來，夫婦間最重要的是互忍互諒，想親相愛，不但吵架能避免，眞正感情的維特也須要這兩句話的。</p>

<h3>紅樓夢的戲曲</h3>
<p>— 葉德均</p>
<p>乾隆末年高鶚續本一百二十回「紅樓夢」出世以後，到嘉慶，道光間續作的很多，現在所知道的已有十四種。同時把「紅棋夢」改爲戲曲的也不少。「紅樓夢」在那時，可說是盛極一時了。關於「紅樓夢」的雜劇，傳奇，通常所知道的只有三種，如靑木正兒「中國近世戲曲史」所叙述的。但其實並不止此，至少有下列道幾種：</p>
<p>「紅樓夢傳奇」仲雲澗作，嘉慶四年已未刋本。書分上下二卷；上卷三十二折，下卷二十四折。據「紅樓夢」正續書撰成，流傳最盛，「集成曲譜」所錄四折，即選自這本。楊懋建「長安看花記」，梁廷　「藤花曲話」卷三曾著錄，梁氏極賞之。雲澗名不詳，號紅豆村樵，蘇州人，曾懊弟子（以上見原書題詞及署名），生平不詳。</p>
<p>「醒石緣」（一名「紅樓夢」）萬榮恩撰，嘉慶八年癸亥香心書屋刋本（北平圖書館藏，未見），鄭振鐸先生藏有鈔本（見西諦所藏善本戲曲書目）。書分「瀟湘怨」，「怡紅樂」二部，前者四集三十六折，後者二集二十四折。姚燮「今樂考證」（十），「紅樓夢綱領」著錄。萬榮恩字玉卿，號心靑居士，江寧人，善繪畫。所著戲曲除這本外，又有「謫花樓」一種，見馮金伯「墨香居畫識」卷十。</p>
<p>「紅樓夢散套」荊石山民撰，嘉慶二十年乙亥蟾波閣刋本。書僅十六折：歸省，葬花，警曲，擬題，聽秋，劍會，聯句，癡誄，顰誕，寄情，走魔，禪訂，焚稿，冥昇，訴愁，覺夢。折各一事，不相連續，是雜劇的變體（乾嘉間此體盛行，如楊潮觀「吟風閣」三十二種，徐　「寫心雜劇」十八種）。「長安看花記」，「藤花曲話」，「今樂考證」（十）並著錄。吳梅「中國戲曲概論」謂荆石山是黃兆魁，太倉人。「今樂考證」題吳鎬，說：「鎬鎮洋人，監生，著有「荆石山房詩文集」，「漢魏六朝志墓金石例」，自署曰荆石山民。」按姚說頗是。</p>
<p>「紅樓夢」花韻菴主撰，嘉慶二十四年己卯家刋本，北平圖書館藏本。一卷，十折，亦雜劇類。此書僅戲曲音樂展覽會目錄著錄。按花韻菴主是石韞玉，石字執如，號琢堂，獨學老人，花韻菴主都是別署，吳縣人，官至山東按察使。著有「花間九奏」雜劇九種：伏生授經，羅敷採桑，桃葉渡江，桃源漁父，梅妃作賦，樂天開閣，賈島祭詩，琴操參禪，對山救友（有乾隆原刋，嘉慶重刋及淸人雜劇三本）。石氏「獨學慮全集」九種全收，獨無「紅樓夢」。</p>
<p>「十二釵」朱鳳森撰，嘉慶刋「蘊山六種曲」本。此本北平圖書館藏，亦末見。諸家曲目都未著錄，僅許鴻磐「三釵夢」首曾涉及之。鳳森字蘊山，臨桂人，生平不詳。所撰戲曲共六種。</p>
<p>「三釵夢」許鴻磐撰，「六觀樓北曲」本（有道光，同治二刻本）。此種亦雜劇體，曲目均失收。許氏所著戲曲別有：「西遼記」，「雁吊書」，「女雲台」，「孝女存孤」，「儒吏完城」五種。</p>
<p>「紅樓夢傳奇」陳鍾麟撰，有道光漢靑齋原刋及光緒十六年重刋二本（別有坊刋排印本）。書訂八卷八十折，頗冗長。「今樂考證」，「曲錄」並著錄，「長安看花記」，「詞餘叢話」都不滿其作。按陳字厚甫，元和人，嘉慶進士，官杭嘉湖道，工制藝。</p>
<p>「紅樓新曲」嚴保庸撰，作於道光三四年間。此本今未見傳本，「今樂考證」（四）淸雜劇部著錄。按嚴保庸字但常，號問樵，丹徒人，官山東棲霞知縣。所撰雜劇有：「望夫石」（四折），「姽嬞封」（六折），有排印本傳世。「今樂考證」另著錄六種（此種在內）：「孟蘭夢」（存），「同心言」，「奇花鑑」（以上二種及新曲又見蔣寳齡「墨林今話」卷十一），「呑氈報」，「雙烟記」，後四種均未見傳本。此種今雖未見傳本，但梁章鉅「橄聯續話」卷四曾略記此劇：「嚴問樵曰：道光癸未甲巾間，余以會試留都，暇日輙製新曲，付梨園歌之，傾動一時，彼中人多有以師事者，余嘗有句云：「偶緣我作逢塲戲，竟累人爲舉國在」，耙實也。。……又曰：余所製「紅樓」雜劇，中有巾緣一折，叙花襲人嫁蔣玉函事。詰且將登塲矣，曲師來請：「塲上舖設新房」，尙少一扁對，乞書之。」余即書「玉軟花嬌」四字爲額。對語屢思不解，正躊躇間，忽見雛伶二人翩然而至者，則其徒也：一名天壽，字眉生；一名仙壽，字月生，即同習此劇者，意有所屬，即成一聯云：「好兒女天仙雙壽」，「小團欒眉月三生」。』</p>
<p>「紅樓夢」的戲曲，現在所知道的就是上列的八種。王國維「曲錄」另據「詞餘叢話」錄高蘭墅作的一本，按「叢話」卷三本張問陶詩立說；誤高鶚「紅樓夢」續書爲戲曲，「曲錄」因而誤收。</p>
<h3>蔣主席像（雕塑）</h3>
<h3>路南聽土人撒尼歌　有序</h3>
<p>— 趙誠伯</p>
<p>趙將軍誠伯隨孫總理革命，任大元帥府參軍；四十年來，迭奏軍功，而才兼文武，學貫中西，所作詩詞駢　，允稱超絕。雲南省黨部表演邊疆歌舞，即撒尼歌也。　孫熙誌。路南彌勒，山水奇光，孟冬季月，天氣晴暘，冰雪方解，蒹葭已長，涼風習習，白露未霜，呼朋携友，游此名邦；，土風雅採，韻什琅琅；處今視昔，古調茫茫，俗音爭競，雅樂全亡，禮失之後，求野補償。居民撒尼，搆土起房，衣冠樸質，風俗陶唐，日入則息，日出則忙，渾渾噩噩，徜徜徉徉；桃花源地，華胥天堂。遊此勝地，冬暮春將，早花呈媚，新水生香；主客莫辨，雞犬相忘；獵戶張網，蠶女摯筐，春風吹綠，秋霰凋黃，三冬曝背，九夏携囊，東　北野，醉飲千觴；男女雜坐，自由義皇；楊白花曲，河滿子腔，來求安樂，以此爲鄉。</p>
<p>行色忽遽天將黑，尋得長湖山水國；不識吾人　樂村，爐烟鹽渺松坪北。山環坪落盡松風，風送宮商曲未終，迹聲月峽蘆花白，光彩依稀不可得；傍水綠山一徑通，村前秋景夜楓紅，此地從來無甲子，花開花落度鴻蒙。耕山釣水，漁網獵弓；烏托邦裏，理想國中；勞勞役役，朝朝夕夕；旖旎萬樹花，嵯峨千堆石，王帽山頭月色曦，村中兒女斷腸時；招魂喚魄原無意，泣葉悲花自有思。地火熊熊傷聽客，聲起抽絲忽裂帛，北諺　風宜激唱，南騷楚舞重低拍；伊訛襟上淚痕多，草野衣冠慟欲何？劉阮天台莫動問，桃花人面兩婆娑。</p>
<h3>記趙景深</h3>
<p>— 復君</p>
<p>前些年讀過景深先生的「文人剪影」，對景深的文壇人物接觸的頻繁，與人交誼之深原，早已「景仰綦深」了，勝利後，又得見他的「文人印象」，更添加了我對他的欽敬。在這幾十年來，在這文壇上能够牢守自己的崗位，始終不爲外力所搖撼，反而因爲神聖的抗戰向更堅强了他的鬭志的，景深要算是可以提起的一個了。</p>
<p>其實只要稍稍注意文學運動以來的文壇情形的，誰也知道景深先生對於文學這工作的忠心的。在天津南開中學時代，也許比這時還早一些，景深已是許身於文學了。從此戰戰兢兢，努力不懈，只有向前，不知落後，先是民間故事的探討，繼之作世界文壇消息的介紹，近年對戲曲小說以至笑話的硏究，埋頭苦幹，孜孜矻矻，舊的發掘，新的發現，予文壇的影響可謂不小。尤其他的「柴霍甫矩篇傑作集」的介紹，更屬我國翻譯文學方面的不朽事業，他的毅力和持久之心，該給一些朝秦暮楚的西洋文學介紹者愧死！</p>
<p>有一次他在大厦大學演講，一個狄窄的敎室，竟擠得水洩不通，甚至於窗口上都爬滿了人，眞是人山人海，萬頭攢動。景深先生的亦莊亦諧的講　，加上手之舞之的姿態，博得多少的掌聲！這事離今已逾十年，但在我們的胸海裏迄今還留着很深刻的印象，並且，今後也不致于於泯滅的！</p>
<p>景深先生對於提携後進，最稱不遺餘力。今日文壇上活躍的作家，幾乎可設十個有十個與景深先生發生過關係。尤其是他至今猶屬主編的「靑年界」，被他發掘的靑年作家，眞是不計共數。他爲人坦白，直爽，說到做到，……這些一個好人所具有的特點，都可在他身上找到。太平洋戰爭發生後，他懷着一顆對國家民族盡忠孝之心在敵魔嚴密監視之下，脫險而往皖西大別山繼續爲國家文化敎育工作效勞，這種堅苦卓絕的精神，誠不下於一個在前綫與敵人肉搏的戰士！</p>
<p>作家趣事</p>
<h3>馬克吐溫談戒烟</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>美國小說家兼幽默大師馬克吐溫，他眞名克勒曼斯（SamuelLanghorne　Clemens　12853　-1910，有一次他和一個朋友談起戒烟這件事，爭辯得很厲害。朋友說戒烟是極難的，他却說挺容易，於是他用他的經騐來解釋說：「戒烟有什麽難呢！我有經騐，我吿訴你：我自己就戒過一千多次，這還算難吧？」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　83</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「哼！」這是一種日人特有的鼻音。果然緊接就有一個沙拉拉而重濁的聲音「把軋×××」駡着。這聲音，雖說隔着牆頭，可也聽得出距離我們坐的地方，最多不過三四碼。駡聲未歇，同時又聽得有狺狺的狗聲，夾在人聲一齊。會兒那狺狺之聲，逐漸加高，且狺且低聲的吠着，又夾有沉重的脚步，一頓一頓地，和狗的脚爪爬抓地面上的碎石作響。這種複雜的聲音，集在一起，明顯的可以想像到，似乎有人牽着一隻大猛犬；那犬掙着牽引的　索，要向前跑，牽索的人　用力往回拉着，不讓那狗奔跑似的。</p>
<p>人和犬，一個前掙，一個後拖的閙了一刹，猛聽得那人，大聲吆喝，同時聽得似乎踢了那狗一脚。那狗挨了一脚，僅僅嗥了一聲，並不停止掙扎，却是愈掙愈離我們坐的地方近了，還有猛烈跳躍的聲音。從這種情形聰來，我斷定，必是有人牽着一匹猘犬，向我們這裏走米，狗的嗅覺厲利，也許嗅到我們氣味，故此想掙脫那牽牠的繩索，跳過牆頭來，襲擊我們。但因這裏，大的一直從未發生過有人越禁的事，日人大意慣了，所以那牽狗的人，一時想不到牆外有人，只當是那狗突然發了野性，不聽調動而已。所以僅使祇想把那狗勒住，並不想上牆査着。</p>
<p>我揣想到這種情形，不覺背春上起了一陣冷噤，潛意俄的伸手去握住了虎弟的胳膀，同時倒轉頭去瞧着虎弟。虎弟這時，大的也意識到牆那邊是怎麼一同事，也正側着耳朶，很留神的在聽着，朦隴的微光下，我看見他那張圓鼓鼓的小險孔上，一絲驚恐的神情也沒有。</p>
<p>隔牆的人和狗，鬧了一會，漸漸平靜下來，最後只聽得擗擗一連幾下，好像鞭子或皮條抽在那狗身上似的，一邊抽一邊嘰咕着，那狗挨了皮鞭，低低嗥了兩聲，這才人和狗的動作聲音，都靜止了。靜止了很有一會，方聽得嗤的一聲，就在我們的身後饗着，好像劃着火柴，大的那牽狗的傢伙抽起烟來了。正是這時候，那探照燈又掃了過來，從我們而前一閃，掠了過去。</p>
<p>這探照燈一連三下，這麽掃過來，又掠了過去；動作上很均勻，每决一掃一掠的間歇，好像有一定的時間，我忽然悟到這探照燈，並非軍用的那一種，乃是海上燈塔所用那種自動探海燈，　動一次一次的輪轉着。我佔計時間，大的每隔六七分鐘模樣，轉動一圈，一這種燈裝在這裏，是個什麽用意呢？我想最大的目的，恐怕就是一種警備；也許在那橋上，偶然也許有崗哨在燈塔上打着望遠鏡，就着燈光四而看看，怕有偸襲：同時也叫人知道，這禁衛區內，不是沒有警備的。悟出了這一點道理，我倒放了不少心，减去了不少的緊張。</p>
<p>燈光掠過了一會，突然又聽見那狗息氣咻咻起來；緊接，那沉重的脚步，又有韻律似的，一下一下響着，眞正走到了我們身後來了，這時設若突然停止，不用說，一定是發覺牆外的我們了。但那步聲，可並不停止，仔細聽去，知道一步一步走過去了。</p>

<p>信託局受處理局委託第二次標賣敵僞房地產，倘使照信託局那個辦法，被趕到馬路上面無家可歸的市民，至少在一萬人以上，我不願意　憤激的話，（人生的現實目的，不過在求衣食住行，倘使無地可容，其實是應該憤激的！）願平心靜氣地就事論事，現在，就信託局處理局（其實局長都是一個人）負責人所發表的談話，加以論列。</p>
<p>信託局說：「辦理此項業務，以服務爲目的，至　接引起之問題，實非本局所願處理者。」完全推得乾乾凈凈，那意思就是祇負賣的責任，至於賣得掉賣不掉，賣掉而有別的糾紛，則管不了了。</p>
<p>處理局哩，處理局說：「凡已標賣之房屋，應首先維持原有住户，即根據原主租賃契押爲標準，絕非標得之業主，即可勒令其住户遷讓，設若原有租的早經期滿，當然應作別諭……」</p>
<p>這段話非常冠冕堂皇，初看頗像樣，實際上等於不說。爲什麼，以這次听標賣的卅九個單位來說，不是祖的早就期滿，即是勝利後從後方來的公務人員所住用的，他們得不到「分配」的便利，哪裏有什麼原主的租賃契的呢？旣稱敵偽房地產，原主非敵（遺送回國）即僞（在監獄裏），又怎麽能和他們訂契的？這不是明明開玩笑嗎？</p>
<p>上海也有房地產買賣，從沒有聽說過賣房子一定要把房客趕走的，難道這批房客也是敵偽嗎？</p>
<p>信託局要賣，這卅九個單位一萬以上的租戶，我想決不會反對的，產權的移轉，誰呌你沒有錢，賣不起房地產呢？但是，原住戶的租賃權，除非用機鎗來掃射，原住戶是決不能放鬆一點的。因之，我昨天說：如果主持當局不道新考慮，那是會引出意外來的。</p>
<p>其實，也很簡單，祇要處理局公布一下：此項房屋出售，爲產權之移轉，原住戶有優先租貨權，那就無一糾紛了。然而，我們的勞苦功高賢明的處理局可不可以　樣　明地來處理一下呢？</p>

<h3>關於「淫虐狂」</h3>
<p>— 麥葉</p>
<p>你會注意到麼？句日以前本報國際新聞版上登戰十六日倫敦聯合社這一條駭人聽聞的電報：「退伍空軍駕駛員希斯原係一美少年，因犯淫虐狂，先後殺死兩女，今日在本頓維爾監獄中絞決，此爲英國史上一驚人案件。該犯最初謀殺電影演員賈納夫人，被害人赤裸屍體係於今年六月廿一日在倫敦某旅館渠所居房內發現，兩足被縛胸背被鞭撻十七處，身上有齒痕，並被類似火鉗等器具殘害甚重。此案發生後，不足兩星期，又在本恩第斯海濱用同樣淫虐方式殺死美貌少女馬歇爾，女屍在海岸附近墓中發現，身上亦有濫咬及鞭打痕跡。」</p>
<p>「淫虐狂」，英文呌做Sadism，也有人譯作「虐待淫亂症」，從心理學上說，毫無疑義它是屬於一種變態心理和病態行爲。簡單地下個定義：淫虐狂患者對於心中所愛的情人（無論雙方彼此相戀的或單方的單　者），必要使得對方在自己手下受到痛苦而自己才感到滿足和快感，而且對方愈痛苦，自己就愈快樂。　上頭電文中所記載的那位空軍兩次所作所爲，正是典型的例子。</p>
<p>不過兩性間的戀愛過程中，也常常有極輕度的「淫虐在」行爲表現出來，常人多不引以爲異。譬如舊小說中說的：那位「才子」要在「佳人」的頭上拔一把頭髪一作爲紀念，或者，男的咬女的指頭甚至咬出血來才感到痛伏。又或者，彼此嚙臂爲盟；假嗔假怒的在愛人臉上摑一把……之規，無一不是「淫虐狂」的表現，所不同者，程度上有輕重而已。淸代的纏足，「楚王好細腰」而白白的讓「宮中多餓死」，亦是淫虐在的表現。</p>
<p>割死·奸屍</p>
<p>割屍，姦屍……這一類可怕的殘虐行爲也是屬於「淫虐在」的。十二三年前日木東京發生過一件哄動全國的犯罪新聞，全國報紙，播音台，警察網都動員了，才協力的捕獲到女犯。據她後來坦白的供述：她非常愛那男子，伹她要佔有他，永遠地而且安全地佔有他，那只好把他絞殺死了。更可怕的殘虐性表現，是她割下了男的性器，行兇後逃走許多地方，過了許多天，到捕獲到她時，那一包她割下來的東西，仍然很珍貴地留在懷裏。她並不像普通的瘋子在人，當殘虐性過了，一切思索力和反應，就恢復常態。當時有人預測她定必判處死刑，但法庭接受心理學專家的檢定意見書，僅僅判了很輕很輕的罪，不過，她離開監獄以後，要有一個時期住在神經病院。</p>
<p>麻木·滿足</p>
<p>上頭所引胡電文中男主角希斯，似如他不是個軍人身份，不按軍法來審判，他　　　　是不　處絞　。‘</p>
<p>同樣的是屬於變　一心理又有所謂「受虐狂」或「受虐淫亂症」，它和上文所說的「淫虐在」正是一對孿生兄弟。「受虐狂」的徵狀是對於外來普通的性刺激和性享受都不感到滿足甚至麻木，惟有讓愛人儘量地來鞭韃，咬　，　扯　甚至宰割自己，才感到無上的興味和滿足。「淫虐在」是生動，「受虐在」是被動，本質上並無很大的差別。小說上說女人在接吻時讓男的咬她口唇才有更大的快感，這就是「受虐狂」最輕的例子。「刺身」，「文身一，未開化民族之穿鼻穿耳，其起源也不外乎「受虐在」。</p>
<p>時事雜感</p>
<h3>軍官</h3>
<p>— 肇蘭</p>
<p>搗毁報館的事件，在人們的腦海中，尙未完全消滅時；××，道一個多事的地方，在最近一個星期內，又連續的發生了「××命案」（詳見三日前綫日報）及「車站軍警大衝突案」（詳見三日本報）驚人的兩件事。</p>
<p>這兩件事，巧得很，都是駐錫××第××總隊一手所主持，對道些，我覺得××第××總隊，太不成話說了！</p>
<p>××命案，車夫軋死了軍人，照理該由治安當局，査明肇事責任，隨後交由司法機關，判以應得之罪，逍才是正理。怎麽就推派代表至縣府要求賠償醫藥，家屬生活，子女敎育等費一萬二千萬元，縣府拿不出這一筆鉅款，便認爲沒有懇切答復，就槍決了車夫？</p>
<p>這一件事，我們姑不論：軋死了軍人，是不是「不論肇事的責任，而一槪處司機以死刑」這一條，是國家的法律？單就車夫軋死軍人而言，爲什麼該受軍法從事，而遭槍決？難道無錫沒有法院嗎？我有些不解！</p>
<p>關於車站軍警大衝突案，這更覺得離奇了，取締無票軍人乘車，這是政府的法令！路警奉令執行，絲毫沒有錯誤，而這一批××總隊的「××一，居然大打出手，搗毁路站，搶奪路警槍械，毆傷路警及高級長官，如臨大敵的三度衝鋒，以段本部爲靶子，對準放槍達一晝夜！（據報載迄至二日仍未解決）</p>
<p>「取締無票乘車」，是國家的法令，「鐵路段站」，是國家的財產，凡是一個國民，都得切實遵行國家的法令！都得盡力保護國家的財產！然而××總隊的「軍官」除了沒有遵行國家的法令外，並且轟毁了國家的財產！打傷了爲國家服務的公務員！</p>
<p>爲了人權的保障，國家法令的實施，軍人紀律的嚴肅，我們應該大聲疾呼的來糾正這種野蠻的舉動！因爲他們現在已是軍官了，軍官如此，將來率領的部下又該如何！</p>
<p>我們且等着這一次事件的結果如何，因爲它可以當　將來軍紀的考騐。</p>
<h3>門牌·里明·灰塵</h3>
<p>— 蔡麟</p>
<p>許多大公司大商號，祇　求門面如何建築成富麗堂皇，而使建築師感到殺頭痛最厭惡的是一塊藍地白字的門牌號碼，實在感到無法安插，於是乎乾脆的不要它了。所以上海有好多公司與商號的門而上，找不到門牌的，甚至一連出有不少門戶都沒門脾的，倘若陌生人要找該處的門牌號頭，就非常的困難了。</p>
<p>本來弄堂都有××里的弄名，再有公用局釘的號頭磁牌，可是弄堂裏開設了不少行號與小型工廠，於是弄堂口的鉗皮招牌，彷彿廟裏的匾額般密密層層，把里名與弄號一？腦兒遮煞了。如果要找某里某號弄堂，那裏找得到呢。</p>
<p>聽說現在公用局正着手整理門牌，希望注意　　點，幷設法改善或處罰。</p>
<p>「八一三」之前，上海的馬路，每大有許多穿紅馬甲的清道夫，負責打掃，行人道上的水門汀，隔一兩日冲洗一次，酒掃得乾乾凈凈，而噴水汽車尙且一天到晚在各馬路上兜圈子，那時候的馬路是「最淸潔」的，的確衛生之至。</p>
<p>勝利迄今，一年有餘，上海的一切，似乎皆已上了軌道，現在惟獨少的是噴水汽車，以及看不到　紅馬甲的淸道夫，即使有也許僅打掃幾段重要的馬路，所以到處「聚沙成塔，」（骯髒得一塌糊塗，）要是刮風天在馬路上跑，猶之乎到了蒙古的沙漠之區，灰沙飛揚，令人張眼勿開，尤其目下深秋，行人道上，落葉盈寸，富有詩意。</p>
<p>利用空氣，上海已發明了風掃地。</p>

<h3>Solemn Signing of Sino-American Commercial Treaty by Plenipotentiary Representatives of Both Countries</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] The Sino-American Commercial Treaty was formally signed at 4:00 PM on the fourth floor of the Executive Yuan. Inside the room, the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father of the Republic were hung on the right end, while the portrait of the Chairman in military dress uniform was hung on the left.

People from all walks of life in China and the United States in this city have expressed their satisfaction with this. Mayor Wu expressed particular welcome for the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, hoping that other countries would follow suit and sign commercial treaties with our country, so that international trade could prosper. Mayor Wu stated that when he was acting as the Minister of Propaganda, he had the opportunity to preview the contents of the draft treaty. He agreed with the American side that the treaty has no political implications but is purely commercial in nature and is based on the common interests of the people of China and the United States.</p>
<p>Li Ming, Chairman of the Banking Association, said that the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty at this time is beneficial to both China and the United States.

In the long term, it will stabilize our country's economic institutions and promote trade between China and the United States.</p>
<p>Other figures such as American Consul Davis, American Commercial Counselor Chauncey R. Schatz, the well-known lawyer Franklin and Schmidt, Acting Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, all expressed satisfaction with the signing of the treaty. However, because they have not yet seen the detailed contents of the treaty, they all declined to express any opinions.</p>
<h3>Mediators Reach a Compromise Plan After Collective Discussion; Seeking Opinions from Both Sides; Issues at Stake Are Listed One by One</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] Peace talks were held all day on the 4th by the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and others, in order to further discuss and study the suggestions made by Zhang Junmai, and have reached a compromise plan. At 9:00 AM, Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, Zhang Shenfu and others gathered at Zhang Junmai's residence and, at the same time, Dang Zhen visited Guangzuo for preliminary discussions. Subsequently, Liang Shuming went to the Jiaotong Bank to meet with Miao Jiaming, Mo Dehui, and Liu Quanying, representative of the Youth Party. Zhang Junmai and Luo Longji visited Zhou Enlai to consult on the Communist Party's opinions on the compromise proposal. At 3:00 PM, Zhang Junmai and others held a meeting at the Jiaotong Bank and invited Lei Zhen to attend to hear the government's opinions. Lei withdrew first, and then continued to discuss the opinions of both parties and revised them into a compromise plan. Although the content of this plan has not been released, it is reported that the degree of peace talks, the reorganization of the National Government, and issues related to the National Assembly are all included. Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Junmai, and Mo Dehui visited Zhou Enlai and returned to the Jiaotong Bank at 6:00 PM to report. It is now scheduled to hold another meeting on the morning of the 5th and invite Zhou Enlai to attend and explain. In the afternoon, they will meet with government representatives at Wu Tiecheng's residence to solicit opinions. If it is possible to approach, this plan may be established. In addition, it is reported that the contacts between the parties have been very frank recently, and the issues at stake have been listed one by one. Even the issue of the location of the residence has been detailed.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Issues Statement Rejecting Participation in the National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] Regarding the draft constitution, Wang Huizhen conducted a study with Lei Zhen in his private residence on the evening of the 4th. When Lei returned to his residence, Mo Dehui was already there, and they continued to discuss the draft constitution in detail for over an hour. It is learned that most of the draft constitution formulated by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference has been passed, and the unfinished ones are small details, which should be passed by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee immediately. Since the Communist Party has no hope of attending the conference, it was decided to study it, and after the Legislative Yuan completes the legislative procedures, it will be submitted to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] Mei Yi, a spokesman for the Communist Party, was ordered to issue a statement: (1) The National Assembly to be convened on November 12 is a unilateral action by the government that violates the resolutions and procedures of the Political Consultative Conference, and the Communist Party opposes and refuses to participate in it in any way. (2) The Constitutional Draft Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference has been suspended since returning to the capital in May, and has not formulated any amendments to the draft constitution. The statement that "the draft constitution formulated by the Constitutional Draft Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference is used as the blueprint" is unfounded both legally and factually.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan Plan to Host National Assembly Representatives; Representatives All Argue That the National Assembly Cannot Be Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Fang Xikong, Chairman of the Municipal Party Department, and Wu Shao-shu, Chief Secretary of the Youth Corps, jointly held a tea party at the Yuan Yuan Hotel at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th to host the National Assembly representatives from Shanghai and those passing through. Representatives from various places including Chen Tingrui, Chen Shiquan, He Yuanming, Xi Yushu, Jiang Jianbai, Zhu Fengwei, Zhou Feicheng, Zai Qi Zhang, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, Director Wu Kaixian, Secretary-General He DeKui, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan, and Director Zhang Xiaosong and over forty other people attended. First, the mayor delivered a speech, stating briefly: Today is to bid farewell to the representatives. The hospitality is simple. Shanghai's facilities are difficult. The National Assembly representatives are representatives of the national public opinion. I hope that they will give more instructions. Then, Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating: The convening of the National Assembly is the beginning of democratic constitutionalism. The National Assembly representatives have the responsibility of drafting the constitution. Our country has been preparing for the National Assembly since 1936, but it has been repeatedly delayed due to the eight-year war of resistance and the repeated political twists and turns in the country. The various post-war reconstruction work takes time, resulting in delays. It is gratifying that the National Assembly has been decided to convene on November 12. However, it is reported that it may be adjourned or postponed after the opening. In my personal opinion, whether to adjourn or not after the opening, and whether it can be adjourned, is entirely up to the National Assembly itself. Before the congress is held, we, standing on the position of representatives, say that if it is necessary to adjourn after the opening, a deadline should also be set, and it should not be delayed due to the issues of representatives of a few parties.</p>
<p>Then, Chairman Fang emphasized that the constitution should be based on the Three Principles of the People. Jiang Huaisu, a representative from Shanghai, expressed agreement with Speaker Pan's opinion, stating that the representatives must have firm common opinions, and the country only allows one government and cannot tolerate other parties with armed forces. Later, He Jinquan, a representative from South Africa, and Liu Ruxin, a representative from Europe, delivered speeches, representing overseas Chinese, hoping that the National Assembly would be convened as scheduled, and expressed that overseas Chinese absolutely love the motherland and are willing to do their best to assist compatriots in the country to build a new China. Dai Jingchen, a representative from Hubei, also hoped that the National Assembly would be convened as scheduled and should not be treated as child's play.</p>

<p>Detailed Review of the Domestic Political Situation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency stationed in this city] The 10th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Youth Party continued to be held all day on the 4th at the headquarters of the party.

Regarding the level of the Political Consultative Conference, the central committee members in various places believed that the party had sent five responsible representatives to participate in the Political Consultative Conference and had reached a consensus agreement with the other four parties, and it was indeed necessary to attach extreme importance to it.</p>

<h3>He Siyuan Takes Office</h3>
<p>Office at the Ping Municipal Government on the 4th</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 4th] He Siyuan, Mayor of Beiping, officially went to the municipal government office on the morning of the 4th and attended the memorial week. He immediately encouraged the municipal government staff to serve the country, not to have the concept of new and old terms, and should focus on work efficiency, using one day to do two days' worth of work.</p>
<h3>Northern Shaanxi Becomes Increasingly Tense</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 4th] Official sources: The situation in northern Shaanxi is becoming increasingly tense. A unit of 7,000 Communist troops, previously shifted west from northern Shanxi, has arrived in the area north of Jianlin, apparently intending to intensify the attack on Yulin.

Furthermore, the National Federation of Commerce held a review committee in the morning of the 4th and a third general assembly in the afternoon. They discussed the constitution of the National Federation of Commerce and had a heated debate about the location of the general assembly's office. Representatives from the capital spoke the most, all advocating for it to be located in the capital. Representatives from Zhejiang favored locating it in Shanghai, the most commercially prosperous city. Representatives from Shanghai expressed their modesty. Only Wang Yansong stood up to speak, without any intention of contention. After nearly half an hour of heated debate, with some representatives almost walking out, the majority passed a resolution to locate it in Nanjing. There was also a fierce debate regarding the number of directors and supervisors. It was resolved that each unit should have one director. Subsequently, Director Lu Jingshi of the Ministry of Social Affairs explained and promised to report this intention to the minister. That article was temporarily reserved. The general assembly will continue on the 5th and may be extended to the 6th to close.</p>

<h3>Wang Maogong Tours Northern Jiangsu; Communist Troops in Jiaodong Conscript Heavy Troops to Attack</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 4th] Jiangsu Chairman Wang Maogong, in order to diligently inquire about the people's livelihoods and direct the "Clear the Villages" work, given that the counties in northern Jiangsu have been successively recovered, has scheduled a tour of Xuzhou, Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, Huai'an, Gaoyou, and other places, starting on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 4th] Confirmed news: A certain unit of the National Army, advancing north from Xinghua, has been unstoppable since launching a counterattack at the end of October and has stationed itself in the Lirenji and Wangji areas on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 4th] Although the war in northern Jiangsu has come to an end after the Communist troops' defeat along the Grand Canal, their policy of killing and arson has become increasingly active. According to a visitor from Xinghua, from October 25th to the present, no fewer than 3,000 people, regardless of age, have been massacred within the city and in the southeastern countryside. The public security in the rural areas is extremely chaotic, making it difficult for the county government to promote autonomous governance. They earnestly hope that the government will quickly dispatch a large army to clear the villages as soon as possible to console the people. Furthermore, small groups of Communist troops have been causing disturbances in the rural areas of Sishui Township in Baoying in recent days. The stationed troops are currently searching and suppressing them.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 4th] Dongtai News: The Communist troops in northern Jiangsu have suffered an irreversible decline. The main force of the Communist troops retreating from Dongtai has withdrawn to the vicinity of Panjiachang, about 80 li from Dongtai, numbering about four regiments. Their situation seems extremely anxious. It remains to be seen within the next week whether the Communist troops are expecting reinforcements from southern Shandong to make a final struggle in Yancheng and Funing, or whether they will preserve their remaining forces and flee north en masse, escaping into the border region of Shandong, Henan, and Anhui to await an opportunity to stir up trouble.</p>

<h3>International Industrial and Agricultural Supplies to China; Very Low Figures for the Past Two Months; Import Volume Expected to Peak in February and March of Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Sources informed our reporter that the figures for international industrial and agricultural relief supplies shipped to China in September and October were the lowest in a year. The reasons are: first, the major U.S. maritime strike, which remains unresolved, has had the greatest impact on the shipment of supplies to China; second, most agricultural machinery needs to be ordered in the U.S., but the U.S. itself has a very pressing need, requiring time for ordering, while the UK and Canada can only manufacture a small portion in this regard, resulting in a small quantity being shipped to China. It is generally estimated that the import volume will reach its peak in February and March of next year. As for the comparison between the original planned figures for various major agricultural implements and the numbers already shipped, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(Original Planned Number)</p>
<p>(Number Already Shipped) (As of September)</p>
<p>Tractors 2,000 208</p>
<p>Plows 500 44</p>
<p>Harrows 2,000 50</p>
<p>Cultivators 2,000 20</p>
<p>Trailers 2,000 30</p>
<p>(2-inch)</p>
<p>Centrifugal Pumps 2,000 0</p>
<p>(4-inch)</p>
<p>Same as Above 3,000 0</p>
<p>(5-inch)</p>
<p>Same as Above 2,500 0</p>
<p>Same as Above</p>
<p>1,000 17</p>
<p>(8-inch)</p>
<p>Same as Above 1,000 0</p>
<p>(12-inch)</p>
<p>Propeller Pumps 300 0</p>
<p>Well Drilling Machines 200 23</p>
<p>Feet Feet</p>
<p>4-inch Well Pipes 10,000 101,730</p>
<p>Feet Feet</p>
<p>8-inch Well Pipes 20,000 150,945</p>
<p>Note: Due to a shortage of 6-inch pipes, the UNRRA substituted them with 4-inch and 8-inch pipes, hence exceeding the original quota.</p>
<p>Seed Drills 60 60</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the supplies already shipped are far from the planned figures. However, according to sources, the international impression of the agricultural machinery used in China is very good, so the original figures will not be reduced. Given the vastness of China's area, even if all of it is shipped, it will not be enough to allocate. However, UNRRA's view is that these supplies are only to assist China in carrying out relief work, cultivating land that was uncultivated during the war, so that it can resume production in the future; as for the implementation of agricultural mechanization, it is a matter for China itself and is not of concern to UNRRA.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Ships Approximately 40,000 Tons of Fertilizer to China</h3>
<p>Furthermore, according to information obtained by this reporter, as of now, UNRRA has shipped approximately 40,000 tons of fertilizer to China, including fertilizer that has not yet been unloaded. In terms of distribution, two-thirds have been shipped to Taiwan in the past; because Taiwan is located in the subtropics and can be planted twice a year, the fertilizer shipped from October to December can only be used in Taiwan. Under Japanese rule, Taiwan consumed 400,000 tons of fertilizer annually, so Taiwan Province will account for at least one-half of the allocation of imported fertilizer for the coming year. In addition to Taiwan, the remaining amount will be allocated to Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces. Furthermore, UNRRA has fertilizer manufacturing equipment worth over US$1 million, which is scheduled to be allocated to the Yongli Chemical Industries. The authorities intend to allocate this equipment to Yongli for free first, and then enter into a contract under which the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will purchase all of its products at a relatively low price, which will be used to offset the price of the equipment and be paid off within two years. In this way, both the production of chemical fertilizers in China can be increased, and private industry can also benefit. This equipment can be shipped in the spring of next year.</p>

<h3>Northeast Coal Production Expected to Reach 5 Million Tons Next Year</h3>
<p>But Mining Equipment Replenishment is Difficult</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 4th] Cheng Zongyang, Director of the Fushun Mining Bureau, told reporters that the coal production of various coal mines in Northeast China has been decided to be increased to 5 million tons next year. According to relevant parties, the actual amount may exceed this number. There are currently no accurate statistics on the coal demand in Northeast China. The mining bureau hopes that one-fifth of the output can be shipped out to exchange for funds to purchase equipment. Various mines have a suffocating feeling about the control of remittances in Northeast China because the working capital of various mines in Northeast China cannot be remitted out as needed, making equipment replenishment extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Signing of the New Sino-American Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>The Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation was signed yesterday in Nanjing by Mr. Wang Shijie, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Wang Huacheng, the Director of the Treaty Department, representing China, and Mr. Stuart, the American Ambassador to China, and Mr. Smith, the Special Envoy and Consul General in Tianjin, representing the United States. The new commercial treaty is broad in scope and is based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality. All rights enjoyed by American individuals and companies in China can also be enjoyed by Chinese individuals and companies in the United States, and all rights are clearly and comprehensively stipulated in the treaty. The new treaty is set for a term of five years, but if neither party expresses its intention to terminate the treaty one year before the expiration date, the treaty will continue to be valid. The signing of this treaty is indeed the first major event in our post-war diplomacy. Moreover, we believe that the mutual signing of commercial treaties between China and other friendly nations will follow. Although this new commercial treaty is still subject to ratification by the highest legislative bodies of China and the United States, the signing is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and it is a concrete manifestation of the amicable relationship between China and the United States. We are especially gratified that this commercial treaty has been signed at this time.</p>
<p>A treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation is the basic code of conduct for relations between countries. It stipulates everything concerning the treatment of the people of both countries who travel to and reside in each other's country. Because of the rights and obligations of the nationals of the two countries, the provisions of this treaty are equivalent to the provisions of law and are part of the laws of each country. Therefore, a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation is one of the most important treaties in relations between countries. Although our country signed new treaties of equality with Britain, the United States, and other countries some years ago, the new treaties only stipulated general principles and did not have provisions for rights and obligations. Moreover, in nature, they were more passive than active, and their purpose was mainly to abolish unequal treaties and the privileges that came with them. A treaty of commerce and navigation is needed to further develop the relations between the two countries based on the previous treaty and to make general and detailed provisions for the interactions between the two countries and to re-establish the new relations between the two countries. This is a constructive treaty that rebuilds the relationship between the two countries on a new and equal foundation. China and the United States face each other across the Pacific Ocean, and the relationship between the two countries has always been close. Now, following the abolition of unequal treaties, we see that our ally has taken the lead in signing a treaty of commerce and navigation with our country, re-establishing the relationship between China and the United States on a new foundation. The Chinese people will naturally welcome the establishment of this new relationship with great joy.</p>
<p>According to reports, the content of the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation is characterized by "eliminating the last vestiges of extraterritoriality," based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and stipulating the principles for the two countries to engage in commerce with each other in a clear and legal manner. Indeed, although the previous new treaties signed with the United States had provisions for the abandonment of all privileges, how to eliminate the "last vestiges of extraterritoriality" depended on the signing of a treaty of commerce and navigation. Under the current environment in China, the new rights obtained by American merchants in China may not be fully realized, but since there are provisions for these new rights, it can be asserted that American people in China will be able to enjoy them in the future when the situation in China becomes clear. The attitude of the American community in Shanghai towards the signing of the Sino-American commercial treaty was quite reserved, and some expressed their opposition, believing that they had already given up extraterritoriality, and the so-called "last vestiges of extraterritoriality" was incomprehensible. All these expressions are motivated by sincere intentions, but if not restricted, the results may create a purpose contrary to the original intention of the signing of this commercial treaty. Therefore, we would like to make a special point here to the American merchants residing in our country that although the current situation does not fully conform to the ideals stipulated in the treaty, this is a temporary phenomenon and will definitely be eliminated after the situation becomes clear. We need to be patient at this time.</p>
<p>Now that the relationship between China and the United States has been established on a new foundation due to the signing of this commercial treaty, we sincerely hope that other countries will follow the United States and sign treaties of commerce and navigation with our country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Although China, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the Netherlands have new treaty relations, commercial treaties have yet to be signed. China and the Soviet Union are geographically adjacent, and our country's Northeast and Northwest regions have particularly frequent trade contacts with the Soviet Union. We hope that a commercial treaty between China and the Soviet Union can also be signed soon. As for Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries, their commercial relations with our country have always been close, and it goes without saying that they should sign this commercial treaty as soon as possible to establish a new relationship. Therefore, due to the signing of the new Sino-American commercial treaty, we hope that other countries can also establish new commercial treaty relations with our country as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the signing of this Sino-American commercial treaty will greatly benefit the promotion of Sino-American commercial relations. China is moving towards the great path of nation-building, and the United States can provide us with great assistance in our efforts to build the country. Similarly, the emergence of a new China can also be of great help to the United States' own economy. Although Sino-American trade is currently developed, everything has not yet been normalized. This will have to wait until the situation in China stabilizes before Sino-American trade can have normal development. We welcome the signing of the Sino-American commercial treaty at this time, because the signing of the commercial treaty itself is a force for stability. We are willing to see more factual evidence of how to strengthen Sino-American commercial and general relations due to the signing of this commercial treaty.</p>
<p>Finally, on the occasion of the signing of this new Sino-American commercial treaty, we occasionally find that a small number of American expatriates have recently published unfriendly comments about China that contain misunderstandings, which is very regrettable. For example, the letter from a reader signed "Former Friend of China" published in the Da Mei Evening News on the 2nd of this month is one example. This reader only knows how to scold the Chinese people, even saying that they are "like a vicious dog biting the hand of its master, clamoring for all foreigners to leave China," so he wants to suggest that foreigners launch a "Leave China" movement. Some of the facts cited in this letter, such as the delay in returning the property of American expatriates occupied by the enemy, are something that we Chinese people should reflect on in order to be understood by others, but the prejudice of this reader, who sees a part of those who have ulterior motives and clamor for "anti-Americanism" as the opinion of the entire Chinese people, is too blind. In short, the most important thing for countries to get along with each other is to understand each other, and since China and the United States are called friends, they especially need to trade, so they especially need to respect each other psychologically and sweep away any biased prejudices. However, one point is that after the signing of the new treaty, since the "last vestiges of extraterritoriality" have been eliminated, our treatment of American expatriates in China should be the same as the treatment of Chinese expatriates in the United States, with reciprocal treatment, and there is no need for discriminatory laws, such as having an alien exit travel permit in addition to a passport, which seems superfluous. We firmly believe that the friendship between China and the United States, the two great allies, will be further enhanced by the signing of this new commercial treaty; we are willing to see Chinese and American people, whether in or out of government, take it as their duty to strengthen their national relations in all their words and deeds, and not give others the opportunity to sow discord.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Station Incident Resolved: Cadets of the Military Officer Corps Comply with Orders to Withdraw; Railway Police Resume Defense Duties After Screening</h3>
<p>[Wuxi News] The Wuxi section of the Two Railway Bureau Police Department had a conflict with cadets of the 17th Military Officer Corps stationed in Wuxi on the 1st of this month due to the matter of soldiers riding the train without tickets. The Railway Bureau Police Department attached great importance to this and repeatedly sent senior officials to Wuxi to investigate the truth. Vice Director Li, Chen Daqing, the Wuxi City Defense Commander, Cai, the head of the 9th Military Police Regiment, Tao Liu, the head of the 17th Military Officer Corps, and others negotiated a solution to quell the dispute. In order to avoid the expansion of the incident, the police department authorities have found ways to isolate the cadets who caused the trouble, so the seriousness of the matter has been eliminated, and the dispute has come to an end. Discussions on the aftermath will be held in the future. The City Defense Command issued an order yesterday: (1) Cadets transferred to the Northeast should depart as soon as possible. (2) Cadets stationed along the railway line should be withdrawn immediately. (3) The 17th Military Officer Corps should form a disciplinary team to assist in maintaining order at the Wuxi Station. The Military Officer Corps has already complied with the above three items. Since the Railway Police Department authorities ordered the temporary withdrawal of the Wuxi section railway police, the security of Wuxi Station has been maintained by the City Defense Command and the Military Police Regiment. Now that the dispute has been eliminated, and because the responsibility for protecting the railway lies with the police, it has been decided that after screening the good railway police who are not suspected of causing the incident, the vacancies will be filled with railway police stationed in Suzhou, and they will be sent to Wuxi to resume defense duties.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Construction Funds: Central Government Allocation Still Insufficient</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th] For the construction of water conservancy and transportation, Zhejiang Province is raising funds. Director Pi of the Construction Department went to Beijing last week to request an allocation from the central government. Upon returning to Hangzhou, Mr. Pi told our reporter that the Ministry of Transportation is now planning national highways, with the Shanghai-Kunming trunk line in the east-west direction, the Guangping line in the north-south direction, and the Fuzhou-Lanzhou-Xinjiang line in the southeast-northwest direction. The sections passing through this province include the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Hangzhou-Huizhou, and Beijing-Hangzhou lines, and the Ministry of Transportation will allocate 5 billion for construction. The rest will be handled by the province itself. 300 million was allocated at the beginning of this month, 200 million will be allocated at the end of the month, and another 1 billion will be allocated before March next year, for a total of 1.5 billion, which is far from the original request of 4.05 billion. The Ministry of Transportation also intends to send an inspector to Hangzhou. The 20 freight cars previously promised have been reduced to five. In terms of water conservancy, the Executive Yuan has approved large-scale projects in the Taozhu District of Linhai, the Shishi Weir in Qu County, and the North-South 24 project in Pingyang, and will provide subsidies. Assistance for flood control projects is only approved in principle, with large-scale loans only allowed up to 1 billion and small-scale loans up to 400 million, and individual plans and loan outlines still need to be submitted. A fisheries loan of 1 billion has also been approved in principle.</p>

<p>Improving the City Center Transportation Network</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company writes: The Reader Opinions column on October 27th contained an article by Mr. Wei Zhesheng titled "The Issue of Developing Greater Shanghai," which proposed three suggestions for restoring public buses in the city center.

<p>Correcting the Expenses of Representative Assemblies</p>
<p>The First Section of the Civil Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Government writes: A letter from Mr. Xu Wenyu, an enlightened person, was forwarded on September 26th regarding the last proposal of the Fourth District Residents' Representative Assembly at its first meeting to raise funds for the assembly's expenses, which were to be shared by each representative. Each person was required to pay a membership fee of 9,250 yuan, and it was planned to collect the money immediately. The letter asked whether this kind of collection of membership fees was reasonable. According to the regulations, the operating expenses of the residents' representative assemblies in each district of the city are paid monthly by the Municipal Government, and there is no provision for collecting membership fees from the residents' representatives. This kind of situation is naturally unreasonable. It was previously ordered to be corrected when the Fourth District Residents' Representative Assembly submitted the minutes of its first meeting.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Faces Numerous Obstacles: Trieste and Danube Shipping Issues Most Troublesome</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th (Radio): The four foreign ministers met in a secret room at the Astoria Hotel in New York this afternoon at 4 PM (3 AM on the 5th, Shanghai time), with extremely tight security. Those in attendance were Byrnes, Molotov, Bevin, and Meuviel, representing French Foreign Minister Bidault. Today's meeting will fully determine the agenda, and substantive discussions can begin on Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes hopes that this conference can achieve three definite preliminary methods regarding the German peace treaty: (1) All countries should express a definite attitude on the forty-year agreement to disarm Germany (note: the Soviet Union has consistently not expressed agreement). (2) The issue of German borders should be resolved. (3) The four foreign ministers' representatives should immediately begin actual work on the German treaty, to be considered by the four foreign ministers themselves within four years.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference opened here today and will first conclude the outstanding cases of the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland. Regarding this, there is a minor dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States insists that the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference should be based on the final draft determined by the 21-nation representatives at the Paris Peace Conference, while the Soviet Union disagrees, arguing that the initial decisions made by the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference should be compared with the subsequent amendments made by the 21-nation conference, and that the latter should not be considered the final draft. However, this issue should not delay the work of this Four Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 4th] The four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet today to discuss peace treaties with the five defeated European nations. This is the fifth time the four foreign ministers have discussed the peace treaties. The first meeting was held in London in September 1945, only six weeks after the Potsdam Declaration, and the result was a complete deadlock. The second meeting was held in Moscow, without the presence of China and France, and the result was more successful. However, the real progress was only made during the third and fourth meetings held in Paris this spring and summer, which laid the foundation for the peace conference, leading to the convening of the 21-nation conference. However, it was almost assumed at the time that the various recommendations of the peace conference would be given final consideration by another foreign ministers' conference, which is the conference that is opening today. The peace treaties with the five nations have been largely approved by the peace conference. At this point, the four foreign ministers are only considering clarifying some outstanding issues among the four powers, but the four countries have vastly different views on these issues, and the success or failure of the conference depends on whether an agreement can be reached, with the issues of Trieste and Danube River navigation being the most troublesome. As for the German peace treaty issue, even if it is not formally addressed, it will be discussed informally. In short, this session of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is of great importance to the future peace mechanism in Europe and should not be taken lightly.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Sends Memorandum, Submits Five Demands</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th (Radio): The Bulgarian government has sent a memorandum to the four foreign ministers, submitting five demands: (1) Recognize Bulgaria as a co-belligerent during the war. (2) Allow Bulgaria to find an outlet on the Aegean Sea. (3) Bulgaria has the right to possess torpedo boats. (4) Bulgaria should receive assistance for reconstruction. (5) The clause in the peace treaty regarding the demilitarization of the Greek border should be cancelled, as the border has already been demilitarized.</p>
<h3>Italy Opposes the Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>Claiming it Violates the Atlantic Charter</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] Rome Radio reported that the Italian Foreign Minister met with American reporters and said that the Italian government will submit a memorandum to the four foreign ministers next Friday, stating that the draft Italian peace treaty is inconsistent with the principles of the Atlantic Charter and will be opposed by the Italian government. The memorandum will be personally delivered by the Italian Ambassador to the United States, Tarchiani, to the four foreign ministers. The main points are: (1) The draft Italian peace treaty is inconsistent with the principles of the Atlantic Charter. (2) The Italian southern boundary line, the boundary line of the Free Territory of Trieste, and the Italian-French boundary line cannot guarantee the integrity of Italian territory. (3) Reparations are offset by Italian property abroad, making it impossible for Italy to bear the burden, and its economic capacity is seriously damaged. Nenni also said that the issue of Italian colonies remains unresolved. The Italian delegation was invited to the United States, not to discuss the peace treaty, but to express its views on the issue of colonies. Nenni also stated that he would never negotiate directly with Yugoslavia and went on to say that he intended to visit the capitals of the world's major powers to discuss trade agreements with them. The Italian delegation will soon depart for London and finally expressed that Italy should safeguard its own interests within the scope of the interests of the world and Europe.</p>
<h3>Security Council Meets to Discuss Polish Proposal</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th (Radio): The Security Council will meet at 3 PM today to discuss Poland's proposal.

<h3>U.S. Army Reserve: Scale and Organization Comprehensive</h3>
<p>Millions of Veteran Officers and Soldiers Enlist</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The U.S. Army Department disclosed today that the U.S. Army Reserve is being effectively formed after the war, with nearly one million veteran officers and soldiers enlisting. According to official sources, the scale of the reserve is currently expanding at the predetermined rate, or perhaps even faster than the predetermined rate. At the same time, the scope of the regular army is rapidly decreasing, and the smaller-scale National Guard is now striving to overcome difficulties in obtaining recruits to replenish its strength.</p>
<h3>New Greek Cabinet Formed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 3rd] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris presented a list of new cabinet members to the Greek King tonight. The new cabinet will be sworn in tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>U.S. Decides to Maintain Long-Term Sole Custody of Pacific Bases: President Truman Reaffirms Position</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Independence, Missouri, 3rd] President Truman reaffirmed today that the United States has decided to retain sole control of the Japanese islands in the Pacific that are of significant importance to U.S. security for a long period of time. Islands that are not of significant importance to U.S. security will be handed over to United Nations organizations or will have a collective trusteeship system established there.</p>
<h3>Trusteeship Issue</h3>
<p>U.S. and Soviet Opinions Fail to Align</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] It is rumored that the Soviet government may take action to prevent the establishment of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, and the U.S. delegation to the General Assembly is making great efforts to reverse this. According to well-informed sources, the U.S. delegation has been consulting with several delegations, including the Soviet Union, after rumors that the Soviet government may take a position arguing that no trusteeship agreement can be established without Soviet approval. This involves a legal issue, namely whether the Soviet Union is a "directly concerned state" as defined by the United Nations Charter. The Charter stipulates that all directly concerned states should approve the various drafts before they can be accepted. The Soviet Union believes that all five major powers, in their capacity as trustee states to the Trusteeship Council, meet the definition of the Charter. It is heard that the U.S. delegation has directly appealed to the Soviet Union and other countries to delay any interpretation of what constitutes a directly concerned state in order to ensure the establishment of the Trusteeship Council during this session of the United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. delegation has not yet decided whether the five major powers should be considered concerned states. If the Soviet Union insists on being a directly concerned state, the issue will inevitably be put to a vote at the General Assembly. The Soviet Union can exercise its right, which is equivalent to a veto, unless the General Assembly decides by a two-thirds majority that the Soviet Union is a concerned state. The Trusteeship Council cannot be established unless the organization's draft is passed by the concerned states and the General Assembly. The 51-nation Trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly will begin a general discussion on eight drafts this week, and the Soviet Union will probably use this opportunity to express its position.</p>
<h3>British Home Fleet Conducts Attack and Defense Drills</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Weymouth, Dorset, 3rd] The British Home Fleet has returned to the Portland Naval Base today after conducting four days of simulated war exercises. The learning commander was Admiral Aifrey, with the battleship "George V" as the flagship. Participating were various types of ships, including the newest cruiser that began service shortly after the Japanese surrender, along with the aircraft carrier "Invincible" and "Sunderland" aircraft, Spitfire aircraft of the Royal Air Force, and submarines. A realistic attack and defense battle was staged in the sea area from the far north of Scotland to the south coast of England. Off the coast of Hayling Island, a convoy of four supply ships was also formed, which was subjected to a joint attack by underwater and air forces.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congressional and Gubernatorial Elections: Winners Could Be Decided Today</h3>
<p>Dewey Expected to Be Reelected as Governor of New York</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. congressional and gubernatorial elections will be decided by American voters on November 5th. Many people are vying for these positions, with the most exciting and important elections being in the states of New York and California. The elections in these two states have attracted the attention of a group of commentators, as the candidates are all nationally known figures. Republican Dewey, who lost to Roosevelt in the 1944 presidential election and is considered a presidential candidate in 1948, is now seeking re-election as Governor of New York. His opponent is Democratic Senator Mead, who is influential in Congress and has been a strong supporter of Roosevelt and Truman. Polls indicate that Dewey has a strong chance of winning. The speeches in the New York campaign have mostly focused on the housing shortage and other domestic issues. The Republican candidate has fiercely attacked the government's mismanagement of domestic affairs, but the attitude towards the established U.S. foreign policy is represented by the declaration of Ives, the Republican leader of the New York State Assembly, who fully supports this policy.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th (Radio): The U.S. general election began yesterday, with 35 million voters. The results of this election will determine whether President Truman's regime can continue to control Congress. All parties are extremely concerned about the election results, and many are betting on them. It is generally believed that the Republican Party will have an advantage in the House of Representatives, while the Democratic Party may have a slight lead in the Senate. The Democratic Party, seeing the Republican Party's aggressive advance, has fought with all its might. Some party members are attempting to win victory with the "divine voice" of the late President Roosevelt. Recordings of Roosevelt's speeches have been played everywhere, and Mrs. Roosevelt has also been giving speeches everywhere, working for the Democratic Party.</p>
<h3>Soviet Revolution Anniversary: Stalin to Give Speech</h3>

<h3>Soviet Foreign Policy: No Intention to Hinder Financial and Cultural Exchange</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] Pravda published an article today clarifying Soviet foreign policy, stating that the Soviet Union will never hinder the improvement of commercial and cultural relations between its country and the rest of the world. The Soviet Union does not infringe on the legitimate interests of the United States or any other country anywhere in the world. Premier Stalin has already stated this. Since the establishment of the Soviet Union is based on mutual respect and equality of rights, it will never hinder the vigorous exchange of finance, science, and culture between each other.</p>
<h3>Post-War Japanese Whaling Fleet to Depart for First Time Next Week</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Two Japanese whaling fleets will depart from Yokosuka and Nagasaki next week, respectively, to whale in the southern Antarctic waters off the west coast of Australia. This is the first time that Japanese fishing vessels have gone to Antarctica for fishing after the war.</p>
<h3>U.S. Rejects Soviet Proposal on Japanese Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] United Press learned today that the U.S. government has rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to exclude the large amount of industrial equipment seized by the Soviet Union from Manchuria from the scope of Japanese reparations. This has caused a new setback to the efforts of the Far Eastern Commission to convene a Japanese reparations conference.</p>
<h3>Japanese Socialist Party Declares No More Cooperation with the Cabinet: Yoshida Announces Six Concrete Policies</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 4th] In order to solve the food problem after the constitution was enacted, the Japanese Socialist Party abandoned its position as an opposition party in the long 90th Diet session, expressing cooperation with the government. Now that the new constitution has been promulgated and the time has come to solve the food problem, the party suddenly declared that it would restore its future position on the ground of the working masses and determined its attitude as an opposition party. The party held a meeting of the Central Executive Committee today to discuss whether to immediately launch a no-confidence motion against the Yoshida Cabinet when the 91st extraordinary Diet session is convened in late November, or whether to submit a motion of no confidence in the Yoshida Cabinet. After discussion, it was agreed that the six major urgent policies announced by the cabinet today did not form the basis for Japan's post-defeat reconstruction, so a motion of no confidence should be submitted immediately. At the same time, a statement was issued denying the rumors that the party would continue to cooperate with the Yoshida Cabinet, and it was decided to unite democratic forces to fight against the conservative camp.</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 4th] The Japanese government issued a statement this morning clarifying the basic policies after the closing of the extraordinary session and the promulgation of the constitution, and announced the specific matters that must be implemented immediately, calling on the people to cooperate. The content of the statement first emphasized that in order to realize democracy, the education system must first be reformed, and the economic foundation of national life must be established to rebuild a peaceful country and enlighten national culture. The six specific policies mentioned are (1) Popularization of the new constitution, (2) Reform of the education system, (3) Reform of the administrative structure, civil service system, and its operation, (4) Establishment of local autonomy, (5) Reconstruction of the industrial economy, (6) Resolution of labor problems and stabilization of people's livelihood. The above content is aimed at the labor unrest after the October Offensive, and it attempts to solve various problems in one fell swoop, which can be said to be the first concrete policy announced by the Yoshida Cabinet since its establishment. The most important labor countermeasures among them have some new directions. The item "reasonable participation in management and promotion of profit distribution" runs counter to the previous statement denying labor management production, indicating that the Yoshida Cabinet has to attach importance to labor and seek its active assistance, which can be said to be a major shift in the cabinet's labor policy.</p>
<p>MacArthur Authorizes Construction of Small Ferries</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 4th] The MacArthur Headquarters, due to the heavy passenger traffic on the Japanese inland sea routes, has recently authorized the Japanese government to build 28 small ships to facilitate inland sea transportation and benefit travelers. In addition, the Headquarters' Economic and Scientific Department and the Industrial Department are also considering a plan to build 76 new passenger ships totaling 72,300 tons to facilitate passenger transport.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Points Out Japan's New Constitution - Says It Is America's Constitution</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The leading newspaper of the Conservative Party in Northern England, the "Yorkshire Post," commented today: The new constitution announced in Tokyo is not a Japanese constitution but an American one. This constitution, along with other phenomena in Japanese daily life, gives the impression that MacArthur is the Emperor of Japan. The only path for the Japanese is to please the commissioner. Those who understand the Japanese people best cannot help but doubt whether it is wise to overthrow a two-thousand-year-old system and force Western democratic ideas upon the Japanese. The problem in Japan today lies between the feudal system and good government. Only through their own realization, rather than being forced by others, can the painful lessons learned during the war produce good results.</p>
<h3>India and the Netherlands Issue Ceasefire Order</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 4th Broadcast: The joint Anglo-Dutch-Indonesian Ceasefire Committee has issued a ceasefire order. With this, the conflict between the British and Dutch forces and the East Indonesian troops in various parts of the Dutch East Indies has come to an end. The Anglo-Dutch-Indonesian ceasefire agreement was established not long ago, but the ceasefire order was only issued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Palestine Terrorist Group - Inside Story of the Stern Gang</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] A reporter from the French "Resistance Daily" interviewed a leader of the Palestinian terrorist group Stern Gang near Paris. During the conversation, they were separated by a curtain and could only hear each other's voices without seeing each other's faces. According to the leader, the Stern Gang has contact with all elements resisting British imperialism, such as Indians, Irish, Greeks, Egyptians, Syrians, and Indonesians. The gang has first-class intelligence personnel who have been trained by former British and American intelligence agencies and Soviet secret police. The gang even has intelligence contacts within the British intelligence services. The gang can eavesdrop on official British telephones, and secret microphones are placed in British government offices, so the gang can learn of any British plans in advance. The leader predicted that terrorist activities in Palestine will increase and stated that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, is a British spy, so Stern Gang agents constantly monitor him secretly.</p>
<h3>Luce Left Japan Yesterday to Return Home</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Henry Luce, publisher of the American magazines "Time," "Life," and "Fortune," arrived here yesterday from Shanghai. MacArthur hosted a banquet at the American Embassy to entertain him. Luce is scheduled to fly back to the United States this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Begins Fast to Advise Against Chaos - Nehru and Jinnah Call for Peace - Conflicts Between Hindus and Muslims Still Fierce Throughout India</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Calcutta, 3rd] According to sources close to Mahatma Gandhi, the Mahatma is deeply disturbed by the mutual killings in the provinces of Bengal and Bihar, and has once again begun a fast, consuming only a small amount of coconut water. The Mahatma is currently slightly indisposed, and his personal female physician, Ms. Naya, is attending to him daily.

<p>[United Press, Calcutta, 3rd] The President of the Indian Interim Government, Nehru, and three cabinet members came here to inspect the Hindu-Muslim conflict zone in eastern Bengal Province and issued a joint statement today, demanding the restoration of national security. Nehru said, "We do not wish to say much about the disputed issues at present, because the situation is difficult and delicate, and a single wrong word may make the situation worse. Our duty lies not only in making every effort to stop the immediate crisis but also in eliminating all the fundamental causes that give rise to the crisis. No one can tolerate the behavior of people degenerating and becoming barbaric. Base means cannot solve the problem, nor can they lay the foundation for freedom." Nehru and his party are scheduled to fly to Bihar today for inspection.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 3rd] The leader of the Muslim League, Jinnah, today earnestly appealed to Indian Muslims, regardless of the attitude of others, to remain calm, peaceful, and patient.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 4th Broadcast: Since the 23rd of last month, the Hindu-Muslim conflict in India has been increasing. In these ten days, 400 people have died and countless have been injured. The conflict is now showing a tendency to expand.</p>
<h3>Another Riot Occurs in Trieste - Ten Thousand Italians Demonstrate Against Yugoslavia and Britain</h3>
<p>[United Press, Trieste, 3rd] On the eve of the four foreign ministers making a final decision on the fate of Trieste in New York, Italians here rioted again, throwing stones at pro-Yugoslav newspapers and institutions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Trieste, 3rd] Ten thousand Italians and pro-Italian elements commemorated the Italian patriotic saint Chiestero tonight, when a police officer led by a British NCO interfered. The demonstration, which was originally anti-Slavic, turned into an anti-British demonstration. Among the crowd, some shouted "Expel all foreigners," while others ridiculed the British with "India," "Civilization," and "Democracy." The riot lasted for three hours, and twelve people were arrested. No one was injured, and the Yugoslavs did not retaliate, so no major disaster occurred.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the UN General Assembly (Special photograph from the New York Times for this newspaper)</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly's Second Problem - The Issue of Territorial Trusteeship (Part Two)</h3>
<p>This newspaper's research department</p>
<p>Chapter XI of the Charter outlines the principles of trusteeship, stipulating that the administering power should "recognize the principle that the interests of the inhabitants of these territories are paramount," that "acceptance of the obligation to promote to the utmost... the well-being of the inhabitants of these territories, is a sacred trust," and should "transmit regularly to the Secretary-General... statistical and other information of a technical nature relating to economic, social, and educational conditions in the territories for which they are respectively responsible."</p>
<p>Chapter XII stipulates the trusteeship system. The provisions are numerous, and can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) The ultimate goal of trusteeship should be "to promote the progressive development of the inhabitants of the trust territories towards self-government or independence." (2) There are three categories of territories to which the trusteeship system applies: (1) Territories now held under mandate; (2) Territories which may be detached from enemy states as a result of the Second World War; (3) Territories voluntarily placed under the system by states responsible for their administration. These three categories and the principles agreed upon at the Crimean Conference are roughly similar. (3) The terms of the trusteeship should be agreed upon by the "states directly concerned." (4) Any trusteeship agreement may designate one or more "strategic areas," and all functions relating to strategic areas should be exercised by the Security Council. The functions relating to other non-strategic areas are exercised by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Chapter XIII concerns the organization of the Trusteeship Council. The members of the Council are elected by the General Assembly for a term of three years. The number of administering and non-administering members must be equally divided to ensure fairness. However, the five powers of the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and France are permanent members.</p>
<p>With the Charter established, the second step was that the UN Trusteeship Committee met in London from August to December 1945, and then presented its discussions at the first General Assembly of the United Nations, which convened in January of the following year. The General Assembly then passed a resolution asking the countries that formerly administered League of Nations mandates to draft conditions and methods so that the former mandated territories could be transferred to the international trusteeship system.</p>
<p>Now, the UN Second General Assembly has been held, and the UK has submitted the conditions for the trusteeship of Tanganyika, Togoland, and Cameroon to the UN General Assembly. The United States is also preparing to transfer the Caroline and Marshall Islands (formerly Japanese mandated territories) in the occupied Pacific to the Trusteeship Council, but stated that these islands were won by the blood and flesh of the American military, so they are unwilling to give up governance. South Africa has declared that it wants to annex Southwest Africa, which it administers under mandate. As for the Italian colonies, they have not been mentioned so far. In short, the disposition of the former League of Nations mandated territories is not difficult and should not cause much dispute, but the issue of the Italian colonies and the trusteeship of those islands in the Pacific (especially the latter) will certainly cause extremely sharp and intense disputes. Are the spirit and methods of trusteeship in the Charter just empty principles? Whether they can work depends on whether the great powers are sincere in cooperating with each other.</p>

<h3>Auctioning Off and Housing Panic - Ten Thousand Households Make Urgent Appeal - Requesting Security and Contentment</h3>
<p>The Senate Resolves: Rental Rights Should Be Respected</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Promises: Original Tenants Can Continue to Lease</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Central Trust Bureau, entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, announced the second auction of enemy and puppet real estate, tens of thousands of households have suddenly panicked about losing their homes, and have been publishing notices in newspapers to make their statements. A reporter visited the tenants of Weihai Villa on Weihaiwei Road yesterday. They said that their appeal in the newspaper was to seek security and contentment, and that they hoped the government would prioritize stability. All the tenants of the villa submitted a statement to the government with three points: First, they requested the cancellation of the auction, because the proceeds from the auction are taken from the people and used for the people, so why not cancel the auction and have the government rent the houses to the tenants? Second, if the government insists on the auction, the tenants of the villa also express their welcome. However, they hope that the buyer will purchase the property for the purpose of investment and maintain the original rental relationship. Third, if no one purchases the property because of the need to maintain the original rental relationship, the tenants are willing to work together to purchase it, but they ask the Central Trust Bureau to give them preferential prices and grant them the right of first refusal, because they are unable to compete in the auction. The main reason held by the tenants of the villa is that all residents are not enemies or puppets, and they have rented the houses since the beginning of construction. They did not rent from enemies or puppets, nor did they occupy or temporarily allocate the houses after the enemies and puppets withdrew. The government's handling methods should be different from those who occupied the houses after the victory, which would be fair.</p>
<p>As for the tenants of enemy properties in Dasing Lane, Dongsing Lane, Shanyin Road, Zhabu Road, and other places on Wusong Road, they also published notices separately, feeling a sense of shared fate. The Central Trust Bureau has not yet auctioned off the houses in those places. According to tenants in Dongsing Lane and other places, they petitioned the municipal government in mid-May of this year and received Mayor Wu's promise that they would have the right to continue their leases.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the real estate department of the Central Trust Bureau, the problem with this auction is not very serious. The department is entrusted to handle it and hopes that the tenants of the enemy properties can bid to purchase the properties themselves, referring to the reserve price. Currently, the real estate market is sluggish, and there are very few bidders for large lane houses. The bureau's first auction of enemy and puppet real estate included a total of seven properties, but only three were sold. As for preferential prices, the bureau believes that it cannot be done because open bidding is a principle determined by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>When the reporter went to the Handling Bureau, Shen Guanya told him about Articles 2 and 425 of the Civil Code: "Even if the lessor transfers the ownership of the leased property to a third party after the delivery of the leased property, the lease contract continues to exist for the transferee." There is also Article 425, "If the lease has a fixed term, the lease relationship expires when the term expires." The above two articles are the legal basis for resolving housing disputes after the auction. It is reported that the Handling Bureau once submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to sell enemy properties to the current residents, but the Executive Yuan approved open bidding.</p>
<p>Of the three houses auctioned by the Central Trust Bureau in the first auction, one on Jiaozhou Road and Connaught Road has been bid on, but because it is occupied by the original occupying agency, Executive Yuan President Song has ordered them to move out several times, and the Handling Bureau has also asked the Garrison Headquarters for assistance, but it is still occupied by the agency. Therefore, those who have money to bid on enemy and puppet real estate do not dare to try it lightly, because they are caught in this dispute, the cash is stranded, and they cannot use the house.</p>
<p>The Municipal Senate's Land Administration Committee held its third meeting yesterday. The Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, was present. The meeting discussed five proposals:</p>
<p>(1) Approve the Shenbao newspaper's letter of October 21st of this year, forwarding letters from readers Guo Zidong and Zhang Binjun, making statements on housing lease matters, and requesting reference. Resolution: Regarding the housing lease dispute, the Legislative Yuan is currently drafting housing lease regulations. If there is a dispute, the parties concerned can directly apply to the competent authority or the court for handling, and the Shenbao newspaper will be informed accordingly. (2) A citizen, Yang Kuiwu, petitioned to strictly prohibit landlords from arbitrarily ordering tenants to leave the house. Resolution: Handled together with the first case. (3) A citizen, Wang Daosan, and 33 others jointly petitioned to grant the formulation of a leasing method for building land that takes both reason and emotion into account, to remedy social disputes. Resolution: The municipal government already has regulations for encouraging the construction of houses. As for the construction of houses on other people's land, it is a matter of the owner's sovereignty and should be handled in accordance with the law. (4) Approve the Land Administration Bureau's official letter of October 16th of this year, (35) Shanghai Land Qingfa No. 3218, enclosing a statistical table of public land not transferred by the former French Municipal Council, requesting investigation. Resolution: Keep the document on file for future reference. (5) Approve the Weihai Villa Tenants Association's letter of October 12th of this year, stating that the original tenants have the right to continue their leases, and requesting that enemy and puppet houses be included and uniformly applied, granting supplementary regulations. Resolution: Send a letter to the municipal government to inform the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau that they should respect the rights of legal leases when auctioning enemy and puppet properties.</p>
<h3>Good News Amid the Housing Shortage - Many Applications for Building Permits</h3>

<h3>Zhou Fohai Shamelessly Brags - Underground Workers Sneer - Open Execution and Assassination - Complete Destruction - Hiding Radio Station is Even More Absurd</h3>
<p>According to reports, Zhou Fohai shamelessly claimed during the second trial of Zhou Fohai by the Capital High Court on the 2nd that he had assisted and protected underground workers in many ways, such as rescuing Dai Jimin, Cheng Keqiang, and Jiang Bocheng, and that he had hidden the radio station of the central workers in his home when the Japanese were searching for radio stations most strictly. After this news was published, underground workers and people from all walks of life in Shanghai sneered at it. During Zhou's time as a puppet, he used every means to openly execute and assassinate underground workers. The so-called hiding of the radio station in his home is even more absurd. At that time, when the enemy was searching for radio stations most strictly, Zhou helped the evildoers and did everything possible to destroy them, resulting in the detection of many underground radio stations, which are all ironclad facts and known to everyone. Zhou's shameless bragging, although intended to reduce his crimes, has caused indignation among people here.</p>
<h3>Strengthen the Promotion of Frugality in Socializing - Please Allocate Funeral Expenses for the Three Martyrs Du Gang and Others - Approved by the Executive Committee Meeting of the Municipal Party Headquarters</h3>

<h3>Soldiers Riding Trains Without Tickets - Railway Bureau Plans New Measures</h3>
<p>Adding Special Cars to All Trains</p>
<p>In order to avoid disturbances caused by soldiers riding trains without tickets, the Jinghu District Railway Administration has decided to add "military riding cars" to all passenger cars (except express trains) starting today, specifically for soldiers to ride. It also plans to simplify the procedures for soldiers to ride trains without paying. Detailed measures are currently being drafted and will be announced soon. As for soldiers carrying luggage and packages without tickets, there are also regulations: (1) If a soldier is neatly dressed and carries luggage without a ticket, he should pay the full fare for riding in a non-military car, and the luggage exceeding the free weight should be charged the full freight. (2) If a soldier privately carries commercial goods packages, the full freight should be charged at the arrival station. (3) Soldiers riding in the "military riding car" for free are only allowed to carry small luggage. Large luggage and packages must be paid for at the full fare and delivered to the luggage and package room for ticketing and transportation. However, luggage with a travel permit certified by the stationing military police can be transported as luggage, and the specified free weight can be deducted, but the word "military" must be noted on the luggage. In order to give preferential treatment to soldiers, the handling fee for soldiers carrying overweight luggage and packages will be waived, and the word "military" will be noted on the ticket. The above measures will be officially implemented starting today.</p>
<h3>Testing the Effectiveness of Wireless Radio Police Cars - Performing the Capture of Robbers - Ended in Seven Minutes</h3>
<p>He Shang Temple, Dim Sum Shop, Greatly Startled</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] During this winter prevention period, the Laozha Police Sub-Bureau, in order to strengthen defense and consolidate security, used the newly equipped wireless radio jeep card to test the effectiveness of catching thieves. Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM, it held a capture-the-thief drill. The results were excellent and the performance was realistic. The mission was completely accomplished within seven minutes. The details of the performance are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shi Sijian, director of the Laozha Sub-Bureau, was informed yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM that five armed bandits had broken into the Huafeng Iron Shop at No. 237 Xiamen Road and robbed it. Shi, together with section chief Jiang Shangpei, patrol officers Zhang Ruzhong and Liu Xuexiao, first section chief Cai Chengde, more than 20 judicial section police officers, and more than 40 uniformed police officers, took two police cars, led by Shi driving a wireless radio jeep card, to the destination. They learned that one bandit, wearing a blue cloth gown and carrying a briefcase, had escaped on a rickshaw, and that there were still bandits who had fled into Yongqing Chan Temple at No. 248 on the same road. So they rushed to the temple, surrounded it, and had police detectives deployed around it. First, police officers wearing bulletproof vests bravely rushed in and captured two disguised bandits, one wearing a Zhongshan suit and the other a Western suit. They learned that there were still two bandits inside, so Shi warned the bandits on the wireless telephone, saying that if they did not surrender and come out automatically, he would order the firing of guns. As soon as he finished speaking, Shi, holding a rattan shield, followed by section chief Jiang and patrol officers Zhang and Liu, rushed in. Before long, they captured two bandits and handed them over to the police officers to be escorted back to the bureau. At the same time, the wireless radio informed the sub-bureau, and the sub-bureau called each police station to be vigilant for the fleeing bandit. Later, the wireless radio jeep card patrolled within the jurisdiction and noticed at the intersection of Fujian South Road and Zhongzheng Road that one of the bandits hiring a three-wheeled car had overturned a bicycle and fled in a panic into the Jin Hongxing Dim Sum Shop. The police officers jumped out of the jeep card and chased in, and the bandit surrendered. A loaded pistol was found on his body and taken to the bureau for interrogation. In this performance, the disguised robbers were all plainclothes police officers from the sub-bureau, including Song Jiabao, Ge Zonghao, Zhou Liansheng, Li Junkun, and Song Shaoke. This "case" started from the report received at 4:00 PM and ended at 4:07 PM, lasting only seven minutes. All five bandits were caught. The performance ended successfully. It can be seen that using wireless radio to catch thieves is very effective. It is hoped that citizens will automatically raise funds to buy more of these vehicles and donate them to various police stations, which will greatly benefit the improvement of public security.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Problem of the Cost of Living Index - Emergency Meeting Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since the municipal government sent personnel to publish the calculation method of the cost of living index for workers, trade unions in various industries have requested improvements to the compilation. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions submitted this to the municipal government, and received a reply a few days ago. Except for the second item, which cancels soybeans and wheat bran and increases the quality of Wuxian rice in the food category of the index table, the rest have been submitted to relevant departments for study and adoption. Regarding the second item, the municipal government said that from the perspective of nutritional considerations, milled rice is considered to be detrimental to nutrition, and the nutritional value of brown rice is far superior to that of high-quality white rice, so the request should not be considered. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting of the members of the Cost of Living Index Research Committee at the federation's conference room at 2:00 PM tomorrow to discuss everything.</p>

This wage will still be paid as usual. When workers have urgent needs for money due to weddings or funerals, they can request advance payment of wages from the factory.</p>
<h3>The Empress of Australia to Return to Shanghai Tomorrow, Carrying Sailors for Training in England</h3>
<h3>Taikoo's Poyang Sails to Shanghai for the Second Time</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to reliable information from the British Company yesterday, the Empress of Australia mail ship has already set sail from Japan back to Shanghai and is expected to arrive at the Wusongkou tomorrow. Due to the ship's large size, turning around after entering the port is difficult, so it will anchor outside the harbor. This ship is carrying 600 Chinese naval cadets to England for training, and British expatriates who had booked tickets for returning home have had their trips canceled.</p>
<p>Since resuming shipping after the victory, Taikoo Steamship Company has had the new ships Fuzhou and Fujian sailing to Shanghai. Now, the new ship Poyang will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Its size and design are similar to those of the Fuzhou and Fujian. However, this ship was built during the Anti-Japanese War and made a maiden voyage to Shanghai before the Japanese invasion of the south, after which it returned to England. This is its second time coming to Shanghai. The company also had a Poyang, a river steamer operating on the Yangtze River line, which has already been decommissioned.</p>

<h3>Blind Men Moving; Teahouse Adjudication; Over Robbing Business; A Blind Fight</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Sun Zhirong, a blind man, earns a living by fortune-telling and has a stall at the Xin Zha Bridge. Because business is slow, he plans to move to Caojiadu. He consulted Xie Wenbao, a fellow practitioner, who is also blind and has a fortune-telling stall at the Wujiaochang on Changning Road, where business is not bad. Xie feared that Sun would take his business, so he falsely claimed that to set up a stall at Caojiadu, one must join the local gang and worship another master. Sun did not believe him and moved his stall near Xie's, each trying to make a living. At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, Xie, without asking the reason, destroyed Sun's stall. The two had a verbal dispute and then agreed to have the matter adjudicated at the Xuezhaizhongyi Teahouse in western Shanghai. Both sides gathered more than ten fellow practitioners (all blind) to participate. Sun also invited four soldiers to the scene. At that time, they disagreed and went outside together, resulting in a blind fight. As a result, the police arrived and took all fourteen blind men from both sides to the Changning Branch Bureau. After interrogation, the two blind men, Sun and Xie, were each detained for three days as a warning, and the others were reprimanded and released.</p>

<h3>Second Meeting of the Birthday Celebration Committee; Establishing One School in Each District; Postponing Casting of Statue</h3>
<p>Amendment Passed in the Name of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of All Circles in Shanghai to Celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday held its second preparatory committee meeting at the Municipal Council at 5:00 PM yesterday. More than 30 people attended, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Xuan Tiewu, Xu Jikui, Shui Xiangyun, Xi Yushu, Zhou Feicheng, Wang Zhuyi, Zhang Xiaosong, and Xiang Changquan. The meeting was chaired by Pan Gongzhan, and after the opening ceremony, various issues were discussed. First, Wu Kaixian proposed that since the Chairman's birthday has passed, the name of the committee needs to be amended. Everyone agreed to cancel the word "Preparatory" and amend it to the Shanghai All Circles Committee to Celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday. Then, the proposals were discussed: (1) How to proceed with the donation of schools from all circles in the city. Wu Kaixian suggested that at least one school should be established in each district, and the school site should be slightly expanded. It is proposed to set up the district office in the school and build a larger auditorium for the district people's representatives to hold meetings. The school equipment should also be complete to form a district people's central primary school. It was unanimously passed, and it was decided to invite the Civil Affairs Bureau to convene a joint meeting of district chiefs. The secretary-general and standing committee members of this committee should also participate in the meeting, and the specific measures should be discussed in the meeting. (2) The finance group plans to send the collection method and receipt style for review. After discussion, it was decided that the committee would designate a bank to collect on its behalf. The specific collection method and receipt style should be discussed in a joint meeting organized by the secretary-general, standing committee members, and district chiefs. (3) How to share the various expenses of the birthday celebration among the participating groups. Mayor Wu suggested that half of the expenses should be borne by the municipal government and half by larger groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the Labor Union, the Banking Association, the Money Industry Association, the Six District Cotton Textile Industry Association, and the Four District Flour Industry Association. The resolution was passed. Afterwards, there was a temporary motion regarding whether the casting of the Chairman's bronze statue should be actively carried out. It was generally believed that the Chairman had explicitly prohibited the casting of bronze statues, so it was not convenient to actively implement it. It was either handed over to the second meeting of the Municipal Council for discussion before a decision was made, or it was decided to temporarily hold the casting of the Chairman's bronze statue. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>

<h3>High Court Interrogates People Who Provided Evidence of Collaboration Yesterday; Only One Reports; Zhang Puhai, Manager of Guolian Theater, Released on Bail Pending Trial; Zhang Shichuan and Others Claim to Be Out of Town or Ill; Family Members Request Postponement of Interrogation</h3>

<h3>Tang Shoumin's Case Remanded for Retrial; Claims Purchase of Cloth Was for the People; Yuan Liang Testifies, Providing Favorable Evidence</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Tang Shoumin, who was formerly the chairman of the Puppet Business Control Association, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Municipal High Court. The defendant refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court for review. On September 13 of this year, Zhou Yunhui, the presiding judge of the Fifth Court of the Supreme Court, ruled to revoke the original judgment and remand the case for retrial. The reasons for this were: (1) The original trial did not mention that the purchase of cloth was for the people; (2) Tang was captured and came to Shanghai, not willingly; (3) The original trial did not mention favorable evidence of participating in the Anti-Japanese War. The judgment was sent to the Municipal High Court in October, and yesterday afternoon, the retrial was opened and two witnesses, Yuan Liang and Lin Kanghou, were summoned.</p>
<p>[Caption: Tang Shoumin Under Interrogation (China News Agency Photo)]</p>
<p>Tang was wearing a gray flannel robe with round-toe leather shoes. He had short, graying hair. He stated: "I am 55 years old, from Zhenjiang. I was formerly the general manager of the Bank of Communications. When the Pacific War broke out, I was in Kowloon. When Kowloon fell, I was captured by the Japanese gendarmerie. On April 15, 1942, I was sent back to Shanghai by plane. At that time, the puppet government invited me to participate in political activities, which I resolutely refused. The puppet Ministry of Finance appointed me as the chairman of the puppet Bank of Communications. The China and Communications Banks were reopened on the same day, but this matter was rumored in Hong Kong long ago and was not planned and prepared by the defendant. The organization of the Puppet National Business Control Association was initiated because prices in Shanghai at that time were very high, and the people were living in poverty. Without control, it would be impossible to suppress prices. Therefore, Mei Shiping, the puppet Minister of Industry, came to Shanghai to convene leaders from all walks of life to discuss and designated 20 people as the founders of the association, and then elected directors and supervisors. From March 15, 1943, to the end of June 1944, the defendant served as the chairman of the association. At that time, the enemy and puppets purchased cloth, covering a wide range of areas in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and did not pay cash but instead used notes. The defendant strongly opposed this. The puppet government later handed this matter over to the Business Control Association, and I had no choice but to put forward several points for the benefit of the merchants: (1) Reduce the scope of purchase, limiting it to Shanghai only, and allowing freedom in other places; (2) Pay cash for cloth, half in gold and half in Central Reserve Certificates, with the price of gold calculated at half the market price; (3) Japanese merchants' cloth should be purchased in the same way as Chinese merchants'." The defendant spent a lot of effort on this, but how could the Japanese be willing to hand over the</p>
<p>gold?</p>
<p>The defendant then threatened that if the "Greater East Asia War" were victorious and the United States failed, and the gold standard were broken, then gold would be worthless. Therefore, if they were unwilling to release the gold, it meant that they were confident that they could not win. As a result, the Japanese could not refute it and took out more than 20 tons of gold. The large amount of gold stored in the "Central Reserve Bank" that the National Army received after the victory came from this. The defendant was also afraid that the enemy and puppets would use tricks again and, after taking out the gold, would order the gold to be nationalized in the future. Therefore, I inquired with the puppet Ministry of Finance whether free trade was allowed. The reply was yes. The defendant then transferred this reply to the puppet municipal government to announce to the people and, at the same time, as the spokesman of the Business Control Association, gave a speech in the newspaper. This was also a great effort. In addition, it was stipulated that 13 categories, such as locally woven cloth, would be exempt from purchase. The puppet government also ordered the Business Control Association to set up inspection stations at the railway station and in the suburbs to prevent smuggling, but I did not comply with it. All of this was for the benefit of the merchants."</p>
<p>Yuan Liang Testifies</p>
<p>The interrogation came to an end at this point, followed by the questioning of witnesses. Yuan Liang, the former mayor of Beiping, stated: "I am 64 years old, from Hangzhou. On January 17, 1938, I was summoned to Hankou by telegram by Chairman Chiang and appointed to preside over intelligence work in Shanghai. I arrived in Shanghai in February and started working. I knew Tang before, but we were not close. In 1943, Tang returned from Hong Kong. In April 1944, the government issued an order for important economic intelligence, so I told Tang to collect information on finance, industry, and commerce and prepare a report, which Xu Yanshen took to Chongqing. On the way, he encountered the Zhejiang-Jiangxi War and handed the letter to Chiang Ching-kuo in Ganzhou, who then sent it to Chongqing by plane. Later, Xu returned to Shanghai in September. The second report was taken to Chongqing by Yin Tiyang via Bengbu. I also attached</p>
<p>letters from Chairman Chiang, Zhang Yuejun, Kong Xiangxi, and Xiong Shihui. In January 1945, when Yin returned to Shanghai, he brought a letter from Zhang Yuejun, in which the Chairman instructed us to maintain the situation if there was a food shortage in Shanghai. Therefore, I had a secret organization with nine departments, two of which, transportation and materials, were in charge of Tang, to maintain order and solve various problems in case the enemy withdrew. The military intelligence was collected by myself, and the economic intelligence was mostly provided by Tang."</p>
<p>Interrogation of Lin Kanghou's Capture in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, who was in custody, stated: "I am 71 years old, from Shanghai. When the Pacific War broke out, I was in Kowloon. Later, Tang and others were imprisoned by the Japanese in the Peninsula Hotel, and then transferred to the Hong Kong Hotel. Li Sihao, Yan Zhongqing, Zhou Zuomin, and others were all together. On April 15, 1942, I was sent back to Shanghai by special plane." The defendant's defense lawyer also submitted a certificate from Li Sihao, which stated the same as Lin Kanghou's statement. The defense lawyer also asked the court to summon Zhang Ziqi, the current deputy mayor of Tianjin, to testify and prove that the defendant provided intelligence. The court ordered that a decision be made after consideration whether to summon the witness. The case was adjourned for further interrogation, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>President of Dazhong Evening News, Weng ShuaiPing, Dies of Illness, Composes His Own Funeral Couplet Before Death</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Weng ShuaiPing, publisher and president of the Dazhong Evening News, passed away at his residence on Diswei Road at 10:00 AM yesterday at the age of forty-six. The funeral will be held at the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon. When critically ill, he composed his own funeral couplet in bed: "During the War of Resistance, I also ventured into danger and difficulty, not dying at the hands of the enemy or the puppet regime, joyfully celebrating victory. Writing the resumption speech and the founding speech again was extremely laborious; dying of illness, death is also something that can close my eyes in peace. A mayfly in the universe, strive to think of acting righteously and establishing oneself, unskilled in seeking and striving, mediocre and without expression. Only the public writings and heavenly writings remain, waiting for future generations to judge; my wishes are fulfilled, life is originally limited." The Dazhong Evening News was renamed from the Da Ying Evening News, so the couplet contains the words "resumption speech and founding speech."</p>
<h3>Renovation of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway Planned to Rebuild Permanent Bridges, Requires a Budget of 60 Billion Yuan at Current Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Su Shaosong, Director of the First District Highway Engineering Administration of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing with the head of the branch of the Administration to inspect the situation of the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou and Nanjing-Hangzhou Highways. Since the first day of this month, the Bureau has set up three engineering branches in Shanghai, Hangzhou and Nanjing respectively, responsible for each section of the highway. At present, both the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou highways are barely passable in good weather, but impassable in rainy weather. As for the Shanghai-Nanjing line, it only extended to Wuxi before the war, and currently only extends to Changshu. The bureau plans to repair the Xiyi Road, and in the future, traffic from Shanghai to Nanjing will detour through Yixing. Wuxi-Jurong will not be repaired for the time being. The wartime losses of the above three major highways were extremely heavy, especially the destruction of bridges. The Highway Bureau plans to rebuild permanent bridges with a load capacity of 20 tons. The Shanghai-Nanjing Road is planned to be paved with Class A pavement, with a roadbed 12 meters wide and a road surface 9 feet wide. The intersections between highways or between highways and railways are all grade-separated, in order to completely avoid traffic accidents. The so-called grade separation means that the intersections are either raised like bridges or underground tunnels. Once this type of Class A road surface is completed, cars can travel at 100 kilometers per hour. The bureau plans to complete it by the end of next year, but according to the current price budget, it already requires 60 billion. Therefore, when it will be completed depends entirely on funding. If there is not enough money, it is difficult to say whether it will be completed in two or three years.</p>
<h3>Buying Crabs and Drinking Wine Leads to Sudden Death</h3>
<p>Xi Deming, 46 years old, from Wu County, living at No. 9, Lane 440, Tianjin Road, bought a string of crabs yesterday and joyfully drank with his wife and children. Unexpectedly, Deming suddenly fell to the ground and died shortly after. The body has been transferred to the coroner's office for examination by the Lao Zha Precinct. It is learned that the deceased suffered from stomach problems. Whether his death was caused by crab poisoning remains to be determined after the autopsy.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Questions</h3>
<p>Selling Stolen Property</p>
<p>Cao Bin asks: My family has two ancestral houses. One house (House A) is owned by my father, and one house (House B) is owned by my uncle. Because my uncle died early and his children were still young, the house was managed by my father. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in the 26th year of the Republic, I joined the army to serve the country. After returning home after the victory, I learned that both houses had been sold by my father. When the transaction was made, it was stated that if the houses were not completely vacated within a time limit, a certain amount would be deducted from the sale proceeds as a mortgage. Now the houses have long been vacated, but the buyer still refuses to return the money. I have several legal questions, please answer them. (1) Can the sale made by a family member during the War of Resistance without my consent be declared invalid? (2) House B is owned by my uncle. Is it legal for my father to sell it? Can it be recovered? (3) Is it illegal to refuse to return the deposit after the houses have been vacated? What should be done?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) All sales contracts during the War of Resistance are valid unless there is evidence of reliance on enemy or puppet forces. (2) It is naturally invalid to sell other people’s property. (3) In the absence of a special agreement, the retained amount can be recovered.</p>
<p>Enticing a Female Student</p>
<p>Wang Gang asks: I was engaged to a Miss So and So in the 30th year of the Republic. Later, because she entered a certain school to study, we did not officially marry. In the 32nd year, I also felt that my academic ability was insufficient and entered a school in the rear to study. Since the engagement, the relationship between the two parties has been harmonious. Unexpectedly, after I went to the rear, Miss So and So was seduced by the principal of the school and had a cohabitation relationship for several months, and gave birth to a boy in a certain place. After I returned, Miss So and So, knowing that she should not have an affair with a married man, reunited with me and confessed all the past facts after the marriage. I am very angry after hearing this. May I ask what legal responsibilities the principal and Miss So and So should bear? What is the procedure for filing a complaint? Please answer.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Since Miss So and So was able to realize that she should not have had an affair with a married man before marriage and confessed frankly, she has been able to correct her mistakes and start anew. You should be especially lenient. Although Miss So and So can file a complaint with the court against the principal for "enticement" and other crimes, it is of no practical benefit to you.</p>

<h3>After Flour Price is Agreed, Wheat Rises and Electricity Bills Increase, Flour Mills are Dilemma, Government Tries to Promote Import of Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to flour industry sources, the flour mills in the city were once shut down due to lack of raw materials. Although they have resumed work, the operation depends entirely on whether wheat can be obtained and work stops intermittently. It is understood that when Mayor Wu convened the flour industry to agree on the new price of flour, the market price of wheat per dan was only 27,000 yuan, while the ex-factory price of flour per bag was agreed at 19,000 yuan. Recently, the price of wheat per dan has risen to 32,000 yuan, and the price of electricity for factories has increased to 180 yuan per degree since November 1st. Therefore, flour mills will lose money if they produce flour at the newly agreed price. It is also said that wheat is prohibited from being exported, limited to the city only. In fact, the wheat reserves in the city were already very low before the ban was implemented. However, the export of wheat is not prohibited in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and other places. It is estimated that the current cost of transporting wheat from Suzhou and Wuxi to the city is 31,500 yuan, which is almost the same as the market price in the city. Therefore, wheat from all producing areas is transported to areas with higher wheat prices. In order to produce a large amount of flour, factories are bound to go to the producing areas to search for it themselves. It is said that the government is still actively trying to transport 100,000 tons of foreign wheat to China as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Weak, Oil Prices Strong</h3>
<p>The rice market is digesting loosely, with more than 12,000 stones of various goods registered. Southern japonica rice continued to drop slightly by 1,000 yuan, northern japonica rice was high but the secondary price was cut, and the yangdu indica rice was slightly weak, dropping by 300 to 500 yuan. The passenger indica and port indica rice also became soft. White glutinous rice was the most sluggish in sales, declining steadily. The high-priced yellow glutinous rice was average, and the medium and secondary prices were stagnant. Bean oil factories picked up cleverly, but the Shantou and Quanzhou prices were unchanged, and the situation became weak and fell slightly. Red beans fell by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Wine shops are reluctant to buy red sorghum. Due to the high transportation costs from the producing areas, buyers are unwilling to purchase, and prices have risen by 300 to 500 yuan. Corn is scarce, and the price has risen by 300 to 500 yuan. Wheat bran has dropped by 100 yuan. There are not many transactions of soybean cake in Shantou and Xiamen. Raw peanuts are sold as they arrive, and the high and secondary prices are similar. However, the retail sales in the central area have cleared, and the price has increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There are few sesame seeds arriving, and the Guangbang are idle, and the price has risen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Oil prices are still strong.</p>
<h3>Oil Extraction Industry Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>The Oil Extraction Industry Association held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Li Zuhua of Dade Xin. Representatives from oil factories such as Zhongzhi, Dayouyu, Dachangxin, Changde, Dasheng, and Shunyu attended the meeting. Resolutions were made on the spot: (1) Because the stock is not much, the 900 dan of edible oil required by the Logistics Department will be changed to 500 dan, which will be borne by each factory separately. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau will be invited to participate in the next meeting to understand the current cost and expenses of each factory and the actual situation of production difficulties, and to take more effective measures.</p>
<h3>Subsidized Flour Distribution Begins, Non-Members Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>The City’s Cake and Bun Industry, Cut Noodle Industry, Biscuit Industry, and other associations, under the order of the Municipal Government, handled the distribution of subsidized flour to the industry. Starting from the 4th, all members of each industry registered and stamped at their respective associations. The associations issued flour distribution certificates, and the certificate holders paid and received flour at the designated flour shops. It is learned that the Cake and Bun Industry Association has a total of 2,279 members. With the approval of the Municipal Government, 3,574 bags of subsidized flour were issued, and each household could receive one to two bags. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, several non-members of the industry such as Qiu ChengSong and Shi WeiRen did not register with the Cake and Bun Industry Association in advance, so they failed to obtain flour. They directly requested distribution from the Municipal Government, causing misunderstanding. Mayor Wu convened Zhang Guanshou of the Cake and Bun Industry Association to inquire about the reasons. It was learned that Qiu ChengSong and others did not join the association according to the law, so they did not receive the flour distribution. Mayor Wu instructed Qiu ChengSong and others to join the association as members before they could apply for flour distribution. According to Zhang Guanshou, the person in charge of the Cake and Bun Industry, the association is ordered to distribute subsidized flour to the industry, limited to members and those who have a joint guarantee, so as to comply with laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhixin Requests to Return to Shanghai, Stock Exchange Business Can be Developed</h3>
<p>Wang Zhixin, the concurrent acting general manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, went to Nanjing on the 31st of last month to attend the annual meeting of the China Economic Construction Association. It is heard that he also met with relevant authorities to inquire about the business of the exchange. Mr. Wang returned to Shanghai this morning. The reporter specifically inquired with the person in charge of the exchange. It is said that when Mr. Wang was in Nanjing, he met with the relevant authorities of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Economics separately, and conveyed the difficulties of the exchange's brokers and their hopes and opinions. The authorities expressed their understanding and sympathy, and the negotiations went smoothly. The exchange is now waiting for government instructions.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that deferred settlement is expected to be seen this week, but the stocks that can be opened for deferred settlement will be limited to a small part of the currently listed stocks.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Turns Up Before Close</h3>
<p>The bond market was initially weak and then stable. People's hearts were stimulated by the short squeeze in the stock market and became active. The most open price of the Unified C bond was around 1,510 yuan, and it once dropped to 1,420 yuan. After hovering, the stock market recovered, and the buying spree suddenly flourished. It gradually rose, and struggled to rise to around 1,700 yuan before closing. As a result, it rose 140 yuan compared with the previous close. Due to time constraints, miscellaneous brands such as A and B were still slightly higher by 30 yuan to 50 yuan. After the close, everyone was scrambling to buy.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of American Flour Imported</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Jielinjie Pilis Spike, an agent of Jardine Matheson's Foreign Department, arrived in port last Saturday. It transported more than 139,670 bags of flour from Vancouver and more than 18,180 pine logs, totaling more than 112,360 feet. It berthed at buoys No. 5 and No. 6 for unloading. It is heard that part of the flour is relief supplies, and the rest was purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. Most of the pine wood belongs to Baolong Foreign Company.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Improvement: 5,600 Bundles of Yarn Allocated; Replicated Products Lack Cost Basis and Face a Dim Future; Black Market Gradually Vanishing Due to Increased Supply</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the yarn market continued to stabilize. The allocation quotas from various factories were supplied steadily, creating a lively atmosphere. Traders were also very eager to purchase, but these were mostly futures orders, far from meeting the needs of buyers. Therefore, the spot price on the market was 100,000 to 200,000 higher than the official price. However, those seeking immediate supply were still happy to accept it, indicating actual sales. The price of 20-count yarns of various brands was 30,000 to 40,000 better than last weekend. In particular, Double Horse yarn rose again to 2.14 million. The sales of 40-count double-ply yarn were relatively sluggish, with no price improvement.</p>
<p>Details of Yarn Allocation</p>
<p>The first yarn allocation of the third period by the Six Districts Cotton Spinning Association took place yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. The compiled allocation list from various yarn factories was handed over to the Yarn Allocation Committee of the Cotton Yarn Replicated Products Association. The content included: 57 bundles of 6-count yarn, 500 bundles of 10-count yarn, 10 bundles of 12-count yarn, 561 bundles of 16-count yarn, 3,142 bundles of 20-count yarn, 15 bundles of 23-count yarn, 484 bundles of 32-count yarn, 130 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 61 bundles of 40-count yarn, 430 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 12 bundles of 60-count double-ply yarn, 10 bundles of 64-count double-ply yarn, and 10 bundles of 80-count double-ply yarn, 4.25 bundles of 80-count six-ply yarn, totaling 5,626.25 bundles. Compared with the needs of the Cotton Yarn Replicated Products Association, the quantity of coarse yarn below 16-count was significantly excessive, while 42-count double-ply yarn and 32-count double-ply yarn were in severe shortage. The handling authorities felt quite perplexed. However, the supply of 20-count common yarn was close to the demand, according to sources from the Cotton Yarn Replicated Products Association.</p>
<p>Allocation from Textile Construction</p>
<p>Among them, the allocation from Textile Construction was 400 bundles of 20-count yarn, 310 bundles of 32-count yarn, 100 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 400 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 12 bundles of 60-count double-ply yarn, 10 bundles of 80-count double-ply yarn, and 4.25 bundles of 80-count six-ply yarn. The quality of these goods was more suitable. The allocation price was still based on 1.75 million for 20-count yarn as the standard. The allocation prices for coarse and fine yarns were calculated according to the prices previously set by the Textile Management Committee. The allocation standard for various Replicated Products Associations this time was still based on the initial registry from the first allocation. Those who did not participate in the valley factories will wait for the next allocation. The Replicated Products Association considered the previous allocation of yarn from the factories, regardless of the count or thickness, to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>Discretionary Return of Coarse Yarn</p>
<p>It was decided to return the unsuitable 10-count and 12-count yarns in appropriate quantities. According to Pan Shihao, the director of the Replicated Products Association, during this period of insufficient production, the various replicated product manufacturers should make appropriate adjustments. At the same time, it is hoped that the yarn factories can also consider the practical difficulties when matching allocations. This partial return of goods is truly a last resort. Pan also pointed out that the current market is sluggish, and the selling prices of fabrics and various cotton yarn replicated products are already below cost. If the weather does not turn cooler and the monetary situation does not ease, many factories in the replicated products industry will suspend operations. The enthusiasm for this yarn allocation will probably not be as high as last time. Pan expressed satisfaction with the recent direct opening of goods by the yarn factories according to the allocation price and the gradual elimination of the black market in the yarn market.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Expected to Decrease</p>
<p>Pan also predicted that yarn prices might decrease further. He advised the industry not to rush to compete for allocation. According to observations by influential figures in the cotton yarn replicated products industry, the recent decrease in yarn prices is actually due to the fact that after the yarn allocation, factories no longer need to search for goods on the black market. The decrease in practical demand is also an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The six industry associations under the Replicated Products Association system completed the allocation based on the factory orders last night, by association units. Here are the detailed numbers:</p>
<p>Allocation Numbers for Each Industry</p>
<p>1. Towel and Blanket Industry: 210 bundles of 16-count yarn, 136 bundles of 20-count yarn, 30 bundles of 32-count yarn, 9 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn. 2. Underwear Weaving Industry: 302 bundles of 20-count yarn, 76 bundles of 32-count yarn, 7 bundles of 40-count yarn. 3. Handkerchief Weaving Industry: 17 bundles of 32-count yarn, 12 bundles of 40-count yarn, 1 bundle of 80-count double-ply yarn. 4. Handmade Cotton Weaving Industry: 30 bundles of 16-count yarn, 152 bundles of 20-count yarn, 10 bundles of 32-count yarn, 3 bundles of 40-count yarn, 19 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn. 5. Knitting Industry: 10 bundles of 12-count yarn, 240 bundles of 16-count yarn, 118 bundles of 20-count yarn, 80 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 27 bundles of 40-count yarn, 102 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 12 bundles of 60-count double-ply yarn, 10 bundles of 64-count double-ply yarn, 9 bundles of 80-count double-ply yarn. 6. Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry: 81 bundles of 16-count yarn, 2,449 bundles of 20-count yarn, 271 bundles of 32-count yarn, 50 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 132 bundles of 40-count yarn, 300 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 4.25 bundles of 80-count six-ply yarn. The 10-count yarn among them, due to its unsuitability, has not yet been allocated.</p>
<p>Fabric Prices Decline Again</p>
<p>The fabric market still shows no improvement. Transactions remain sluggish, and prices have declined by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. On Saturday, Textile Construction's 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at only 78,000 yuan, while the spot price was 80,000 yuan. Actual sales in this district were scarce, and general users are also taking a wait-and-see attitude. If the weather does not turn colder, the fabric market will be difficult to improve.</p>
<h3>Convenient Settlement Imminent; Lively Conditions in the Chinese Stock Market</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market on the previous day still felt the economic panic. There were many sellers with remaining shares, resulting in further declines. Later, with the imminent implementation of convenient settlement, off-market short covering was urgent, causing a rebound. From noon onwards, a short squeeze formed. The opening prices in the morning were not favorable. Except for Qinxing, all stocks showed small declines. After the opening, there was a liquidation of remaining shares, resulting in a sudden and sharp drop. Yongsha fell to 613 yuan, Meiya to 2,680 yuan, Xinhe to 253 yuan, Jingfu to 190 yuan, Xinguang to 205 yuan, and Qinxing to 135 yuan. Afterwards, short positions were covered, and with the repeated buying by No. 176, the situation stabilized. Later, with No. 89, No. 189, and No. 154 also gradually absorbing, the situation rebounded. After 10:30 a.m., rumors spread in the market that deferred settlement would be introduced and announced that day, and implemented within the day. Investor sentiment turned positive, and off-market transactions were mostly short covering. As a result, buying interest increased, and prices rose again and again, reaching high prices at noon. Then, profit-taking emerged, and the market turned sideways. Compared to the previous Saturday, among the popular stocks, Yongsha rose by 3%, Xinhe improved by a strong 0.5%, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang each improved by 8%, and Qinxing, due to its low price, rose by 9%. Cold stocks like Datong, Rongfeng, Match, Xinya, Lianan, Jinglun, and Underwear showed little change. The rest rose by 0.5% to 1%. In the afternoon, the market continued to be lively, but after profit-takers emerged at high prices, it leveled off. As a result, powerful institutions like No. 89 and No. 176 increased pressure, and the situation turned tired again. However, bargain hunting created a back-and-forth pattern. As a result, compared to the previous Saturday, Yongsha rose slightly, Xinhe rose by 4%, and Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by about 0.5%. Among the cold stocks, Zhongfang rose by slightly less than 10%, and Huafeng, Underwear, Yonggong, and Tongyi each improved by about 0.5%. The rest lacked special changes. The trading volume was 13.74 million shares. Off-market stocks were generally stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks buyers chose stocks that had hopes of being listed in Hong Kong, resulting in slight variations among the stocks. Initially flat, then lively, the results compared to last Saturday showed Yeguang slightly down, while the rest rose by 0.5% to 1%.</p>
<h3>Tax Bureau Cracks Down on Tax Evasion and Private Cigarettes; Manages Handmade Cigarette Factories</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance recently noted that handmade cigarette factories have been established in various parts of the country, but most of them cannot pay taxes according to regulations. Therefore, private handmade cigarettes are flooding everywhere, not only affecting national tax revenue but also hindering the interests of legitimate cigarette factories. Therefore, the "Measures for the Management of Handmade Cigarette Factories" have been promulgated for implementation by local commodity tax bureaus. All handmade cigarette factories should first raise funds to establish companies in accordance with the Company Law, equip themselves with wooden or small iron machines, and apply for registration with the Tax Bureau. Those who cannot establish companies should first organize handmade cigarette industry production and marketing cooperatives in accordance with the Cooperative Law and apply for registration with the Tax Bureau. Existing family-run handmade cigarette households are temporarily allowed to apply for temporary registration with the local commodity tax bureau. The registration period is limited to three months. Handmade cigarettes produced by temporarily registered handmade cigarette households do not use brand names or trademarks, but should print the mark "Recorded by XX in XX Place" on the cigarettes and are limited to local sales and are not allowed to be transported and sold to other places. The validity period is limited to one year. After the expiration, they may not manufacture or sell cigarettes again unless they are organized into companies or cooperatives. The monthly cigarette production quantity is 250,000 cigarettes for handmade cigarette factories and 50,000 cigarettes for handmade cigarette households. Those who use locally made cigarette paper should first submit samples to the Tax Bureau for approval for temporary trial use. Those who purchase imported cigarette paper should comply with the regulations on the purchase and transportation of cigarette paper. Hand-made cigarettes that have been manufactured, if not packed in boxes, are allowed to pay taxes per strip (500 cigarettes) and affix stamps before leaving the factory. Factory-made hand-made cigarettes that have been affixed with strip stamps, if they are to be packed into whole boxes for transportation and sales, should temporarily report to the tax authorities for inspection, and the inspection stamp cargo certificate should be affixed to the boxes before they can be transported. After arriving at the designated sales location, they should also report to the local tax authorities to remove the inspection stamp cargo certificate box by box. At the same time, it is stipulated that handmade cigarette manufacturers should first find ways to purchase machines and switch to machine production, and the competent commodity tax authorities should supervise the handling at any time.</p>
<h3>China Trust Continues to Allocate; Rayon Black Market Declines</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Central Trust Bureau continued to sell rayon yesterday. The listed price for 120 Bright Golden Three Horses was still 2.78 million yuan. The Silk Weaving Industry Association stated that a total of 223 rayon openers applied, with a total application amount of 465 boxes. However, as of last night, the approved amount had not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 120 Bright Rayon on the Tianqiao market was quoted at 3.45 million to 500,000 yuan in the morning, but there were no transactions. The asking price for new goods was 3.05 million yuan.

<h3>Recently Invented Man-Made Textile Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The British parent company of Bu Neimen, a British company in this city, recently announced an important invention in the field of man-made fibers in conjunction with the Printing Industry Association of Manchester. This new product, named Terylen, is the crystallization of the efforts of printing industry experts during the war. It is still under discussion and is very different from the existing natural and man-made fibers. Its features include: (1) extremely strong toughness, (2) less likely to change under high heat and intense light compared to other fibers, (3) extremely easy to machine and hand weave, (4) its thickness and length can be arbitrarily manufactured within a wide range, (5) its fiber properties can also vary with the manufacturing method to suit various needs. When woven into clothing, it does not require as much care in washing, laundering, and ironing as ordinary clothing.</p>
<h3>Crossings on Bank Drafts and Bills of Exchange: Ministry of Finance Considers Them Inappropriate</h3>
<p>Bank drafts and bills of exchange issued by banks and money shops have traditionally been crossed or specially crossed, and are limited to payment by banks and money shops. Recently, the Ministry of Finance explained that because there are no such provisions in the Negotiable Instruments Law, and in accordance with Article 9 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, "Matters not prescribed by this law and recorded on a negotiable instrument shall have no effect under the Negotiable Instruments Law." National banks and bureaus have been practicing this habit for a long time. Once it is changed, it will be very difficult. Relevant business personnel from various banks and bureaus held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. in the conference room on the third floor of the Jiaotong Bank to study the solution. After more than an hour of discussion, the result was that some bank drafts and bills of exchange will be replaced by the bank's own checks, and the endorsement method prohibiting transfer will be used to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of International Silk Textile Company</h3>
<p>International Silk Textile Company specializes in the wholesale and retail of domestic and foreign silk, especially the wholesale and retail of Indian silk. Since Chairman Yang Yinpou and General Manager Zhang Yusheng took charge, the company's business has been developing day by day. Recently, due to business expansion, the original location on Guizhou Road was no longer sufficient, and the office was moved to the new address at No. 34 Hankou Road, Fuda Building.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Buyers Enthusiastic; Foreign Currencies: US Dollar Rises, Hong Kong Dollar Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, investor sentiment recovered. The opening price in the morning was 2.335 million yuan, and the market was generally stable at around 2.33 million yuan. Later, with the renewed optimistic view, demand gradually exceeded supply, and the market rose in spirals. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 300 bars at a price of 2.3425 million yuan. The Central Bank's supply was not smooth, and buyers were even more eager. Near noon, it once rebounded to above 2.36 million yuan before stabilizing slightly, struggling at around 2.355 million yuan at noon. In the afternoon, next-day delivery was pushed up to around 2.375 million yuan, resulting in an increase of 40,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. Gold jewelry was listed as high as 250,000 yuan. Refined silver was stable, while silver dollars were slightly higher. The underground lending rate was still stable at around 1.5%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies initially weakened but then stabilized. The US dollar was around 4,050 yuan in the early morning, but later rose to 4,150 yuan near noon due to the booming gold market, continuing to rise slightly compared to the previous Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar was dragged down by telegraphic transfers and lacked sales, falling as low as around 870 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, it fell another 10 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose to 114.25 yuan due to the Shanghai telegraphic rate, and the local outward remittance market was sluggish. Yesterday, 870 yuan was for sale with little demand. The Indian rupee was at 1,065 yuan with supply, and the British pound at 14,100 yuan also lacked support. There were not many transactions. The listed price of the US dollar did not change, but internal transactions</p>

<h3>Simplifying Existing Education Regulations; Ministry of Education Plans to Improve Administrative Efficiency; Currently Being Conducted Under the Auspices of the Counselor's Office</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, April 4] The Ministry of Education believes that many education regulations were promulgated before and during the war. After the victory, many rules and regulations were also formulated and promulgated for educational restoration and emerging educational undertakings. It is not easy to inspect them all at once. It is now planned to simplify all existing education regulations, eliminating the complex and retaining the essential, so that the inspection aspect can save time, thereby improving the efficiency of education administration. It is reported that the counselor's office of the Ministry of Education is in charge, and specially designated responsible personnel from various departments have been invited to participate, so that they can allocate a small amount of office time each day to consult and reorganize, and simplify all existing education regulations at all levels as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Expanded Memorial Week for Educational Personnel in Beijing; Minister of Education Zhu Attends to Give Instructions</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, April 3] The Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau held an expanded memorial week for educational workers in Nanjing City at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 3rd at the Dahua Theater. Minister Zhu and Mayor Ma were invited to attend and give instructions. More than 1,000 teachers and staff members from primary and secondary schools and social education institutions in Beijing City attended and performed the rituals. First, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau reported that holding an expanded memorial week and inviting celebrities from the education circle to give instructions was the first decision, and it will be held from time to time in the future. After the speech, Minister Zhu took the stage to give instructions, first saying that the difficult lives of teachers were the same in European and American countries. However, at the time of China's victory and restoration, due to various reasons, the vitality of the people has not recovered, and the national expenditure is huge. The education sector has received limited funds and has not been able to reach the standard. Therefore, the treatment of education personnel is even more meager. In the future, it will be improved and enhanced with the stability of the political situation. He then said that the academic atmosphere is not ideal enough and should be rectified urgently. In terms of teachers, do not regard teaching books as fulfilling their responsibilities, but enrich the content of teaching, so that students feel interested, and guide students, especially with personal example. In terms of students, they should strive to change the habit of being arrogant and have a psychology of respecting teachers and valuing the way. In terms of administration, economics must be absolutely open, and the minimum standard of cleanliness and order in the New Life Movement must be achieved. Due to the war, students in national schools are mostly treated with public funds, and some students think that everything should be enjoyed, and even make all kinds of demands for perfection, which is inevitable not to appreciate the difficulties of the public, and is too self-righteous. Education is inherently a poor career, but there is spiritual comfort. It is hoped that those engaged in education work will work together. Then Mayor Ma gave instructions, saying that the city government's total tax revenue is 400 million, while education expenditure is close to 500 million, which is more than the revenue. Finally, Director Ma of the Education Bureau reported that recently, Beijing City has increased schools and added classes, and several primary school buildings are under construction. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 a.m.</p>

<h3>My Student Studying in the UK, Li Zhuangfu, Succeeds in Biochemical Research; Solves a Problem Unresolved for Centuries</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, April 4] Li Zhuangfu (transliteration), a Chinese student sent to the UK by the Sino-British Cultural and Educational Fund Board of Directors, is currently engaged in biochemical research under the guidance of Professor He Huasi at the University of Birmingham in the UK. It is reported that he has solved a problem that has remained unsolved for centuries. According to reports, the student graduated from Hunan Xiangya Medical College, and it is said that he has been able to crystallize cell nucleic acids. Therefore, this complex substance can be easily analyzed and the reactions of its various components can be discovered. This will be extremely important for the study of biochemistry, because after cell nucleic acids combine with proteins, they form cell nucleoproteins, which have a direct impact on the reproduction and growth of animals and plants. In short, cell nucleoproteins are the chemical expression of chromosomes or genetic factors within cells in Mendel's law of heredity. In the biological sciences, Mendel's law is currently the only accurate law, explaining how the characteristics of parents are inherited to their offspring, but so far, it has not been possible to express it in physical formulas. Eighty years ago, someone tried to answer this question, but it has not been resolved to this day. This is because it has not been possible to isolate it into a pure crystalline form. Before May, Mr. Li successfully transformed cell nucleic acids into crystalline bodies. His second step will be to isolate these molecules and then study what each unit is, and then he can find out the relationship between each component molecule and the various chromosomes. The value of this discovery may be inestimable. In the future, it may be possible to discover ways to maintain and strengthen required characteristics, as well as to eliminate the weaknesses of certain chromosomes. This area of research is full of hope.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong Bank Launches Tuition Savings; Relieves Parents' Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>The Jiaotong Bank in this city believes that education is the foundation of a country. However, school fees are currently expensive, and it is often difficult for general parents to raise such large sums of money at once, resulting in some children being unable to attend school. This is a matter of regret. In order to encourage children to attend school and reduce the financial difficulties of parents in raising tuition fees at one time, the bank has launched two secret savings deposits: "Individual Education Fund" and "Group Education Fund". The nature of these two types of savings deposits is the same. The former is designed for individuals to save for their children, and the latter is designed to facilitate group employees to save for their children. Both are limited to children currently studying in middle schools and universities. However, if a child has several people in middle schools and universities, they can also recognize several copies.</p>
<p>Two Types of Savings</p>
<p>Its method: Both individual and group savings deposits are deposited on a monthly basis. The amount of deposit is divided into eight types: 30,000 yuan, 40,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, 60,000 yuan, 70,000 yuan, 80,000 yuan, 90,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan per month. For individual savings, depositors can directly apply to the bank by filling out an account opening application form. For group savings, employees working in agencies, factories, and merchants can consult their service agencies for approval. The group is used as a unit, and the group is responsible for deducting the recognized deposit employee's salary on a monthly basis and sending it to the bank to open an account for deposit.</p>
<p>Five Times Loan</p>
<p>For both types of savings deposits, after two months of deposit, they can submit a loan application form along with their children's study certificate and apply to the bank for a tuition loan. The amount of the loan is five times the monthly deposit amount. For example, if 30,000 yuan is deposited each month, it can be borrowed 150,000 yuan based on five times the amount. If 100,000 yuan is deposited each month, it can be borrowed 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>3% Interest Due</p>
<p>Whether it is individual or group, the deposit interest is 1.5%, and the loan interest is 3%, which is very different from the market loan interest. The deposit period is six months, and the loan period is four months. Both the deposit and the loan expire at the same time after two months of deposit. At maturity, the bank will settle the deposit and loan principal and interest separately, and the remaining funds will be returned to the depositor or the recognized deposit group. Because these two types of savings deposits can only be borrowed after two months of deposit, depositors should plan to deposit two months before the start of the school where their children are located so that they can be applied at that time. If they plan to raise school fees for next spring, they must start depositing in November. It is reported that the bank's branches are located throughout the country. No matter where children study, it is very convenient for parents to deposit and spend money. It is expected that there will be many depositors.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Concerned About the Chairman's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou Dispatch, October 31, Special Correspondent Chu Yu of this newspaper</p>
<p>October 31 is the birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government. This giant of great achievements, because of his busy schedule, has not returned to his hometown of Fenghua in these eight years of the war of resistance and the year after the war, except for one trip to Hangzhou. This great man who has not returned to his hometown for ten years—for the sake of the world and the country, shouldered an unparalleled task, endured hardships, and ignored all kinds of hard work and complaints. How eagerly they hoped to see him, even hug him, kiss him, because: he increased the glory of his hometown and added splendor to the nation. Many domestic newspapers believed that Chairman Chiang would definitely go to his hometown on this birthday. Therefore, at the beginning of the month, everyone paid attention to this news. Chairman Chiang from Lushan, E Jiang, and Nanchang in Jiangxi, news reporters attached great importance to his actions with all their energy. October 9 was his lunar birthday. Before the 9th, many newspapers reported that Chairman Chiang was going to return to Fenghua. Some even sent reporters to Fenghua to wait for him, and some even said with certainty: "Chairman Chiang will go to Xikou in Fenghua after inspecting Nanchang." But in his own mind, the affairs of the country and the nation were more important than personal matters. He had decided not to return to Xikou, but flew to Nanjing to deal with state affairs. On that day, his life was simpler than that of ordinary people. He still worked in the official residence and did not take special actions. He personally attended and presided over the 202nd regular meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council. This lunar birthday passed quietly. There is also a solar birthday. The people of the country, in order to express their enthusiasm for loving Chairman Chiang, although the Chairman repeatedly warned against extravagance, due to a kind of heartfelt support, they still made some preparations, and they more or less realized the Chairman's spirit of being selfless and forgetting himself, so they widely aroused the movement of offering schools to celebrate his birthday. Especially in Zhejiang Province, in addition to offering schools, there are many joyous activities. At this time, the call for Chairman Chiang to return to Fenghua to avoid his birthday came out again. The national press once again paid attention to the news of Fenghua. Beforehand, there were many rumors: one said that the Chairman would fly directly from Taiwan to Fenghua, one said that the Chairman would fly to Hangzhou after returning to Beijing and then fly to Ningbo and then to Fenghua, and one said that the Chairman would fly to Shanghai and then fly to Ningbo and then directly to Xikou.</p>
<p>Confusing Speculations</p>
<p>The newspapers in Zhejiang almost always used the Chairman's whereabouts as an important headline, allowing for news about coming to Zhejiang and me. We can list them: the Central News Agency is preparing to bring a radio station to Xikou, the Southeast Daily also has this preparation, the Zhejiang Daily has designated appropriate candidates, the Zhejiang Business Daily has obtained contact with the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, the Ningbo Communication of the Zheng Bao publishes daily, and the Datong Daily, the Youth Daily, the Min Bao, and the West Lake Evening News are all paying special attention. The Shanghai newspapers are also closely assigning reporters to compete for this news. The Xinwen Bao established an office in Hangzhou at the beginning of the month, the Dagong Bao strengthened contact with Ningbo, the Wenhui Bao sent a special correspondent to Hangzhou at the beginning of the month, and the Nanjing Central Daily also had a special correspondent in charge, taking advantage of the convenience of the special reporter accompanying Ambassador Stuart to Hangzhou, and also made considerable arrangements. After the Chairman flew to Taiwan on October 21, everyone felt nervous. Some in the press advocated sending people to Ningbo first, and some advocated waiting for Chairman Chiang to fly back to the first place before deciding on a plan. On the 28th, Zhejiang newspapers had two different predictions: one was that when Chairman Chiang returned to Shanghai from He on the 27th, he detoured through Songkou, flew low over it twice, expressing his affection, but because the political atmosphere in Nanjing was becoming more open, he had no time to return home, and would not return to Xikou in the short term. The other was that Chairman Chiang would soon fly back to Ningbo and then to Xikou to celebrate his birthday. On the 29th, those who predicted that Chairman Chiang would return to Xikou said that he would not go to Fenghua, while those who predicted that he would not go to Xikou said that he would fly to Fenghua to avoid his birthday. The Shanghai newspapers also had two different speculations. The news on the 30th was even more tense. Some said that he would still come to Zhejiang, and some said that he would go to a certain place to avoid his birthday. The reporter checked his own pre-placed news network, relying on information from all sides and Chairman Chiang's consistent spirit of selflessness and forgetting himself, and felt that the chances of him coming to Zhejiang were still very small. Therefore, the Shanghai newspapers still had two opposite views: one was the delayed return to his hometown published by this newspaper, and the other was the return to Fenghua to avoid his birthday published in the × newspaper. The rumors that night were even more confusing. Some said that he would fly to Fenghua with the Marshalls on the morning of the 31st, and Chiang Ching-kuo had already flown to Fenghua to make arrangements. Some said that Chiang Ching-kuo's wife went to Nanjing, and Chairman Chiang would avoid his birthday in the suburbs of Nanjing. Some said that Chairman Chiang might take a warship to Ningbo and then to Fenghua. Some said that Chairman Chiang would avoid his birthday at sea. Some said that Chairman Chiang would go to Wuxi with Marshal Marshall to avoid his birthday. The news in the newspapers on the 31st still could not publish his exact whereabouts, and some even published two opposite news items, leaving the readers to guess. These things, of course, represent the fierce competition in the current news industry, but the value of competing for news lies in the important needs and interests of the public, which shows that Chairman Chiang's whereabouts are of concern to the people of the whole country and even the people of the world!</p>
<p>A Wave of Revelry</p>
<p>On October 31, the people of the whole country rejoiced. I, in Zhejiang, the Chairman's hometown, felt especially intimate. This usually quiet Hangzhou also experienced a wave of revelry. On this day, everyone woke up especially early, the national flag was hung out early, and every household was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. The birthday halls set up everywhere had a sense of traffic flow in front of them. The gold-sprinkled red stationery for signing birthday wishes was changed one after another. The taverns automatically reduced prices, the noodle shops had particularly good business, and shops posted notices: all goods are 10% off to celebrate the 60th birthday of the Chairman. Even the dance ban, which had been repeatedly requested to be lifted but was never heeded, was also lifted for these three days. Several places in Zhejiang held sports meetings to celebrate the birthday. These many activities were all trying to make them more meaningful and remain in people's minds for a longer time. Some people said: if Chairman Chiang did not repeatedly warn against extravagance, then this ancient China would really make a fortune on this day. Others said: if Chairman Chiang spent his birthday in his hometown, the people of Zhejiang would not know how excited they would be!</p>
<p>If Chairman Chiang is to return to Zhejiang to spend his birthday, we only need to truly realize a new China of peace, unity, and independence. If we believe that there will be such a day, then that day will come!</p>
<h3>Taiwan Fertilizer Distribution</h3>
<p>According to Tang Yuanji, General Manager of Taiwan Fertilizer Company, all five factories of the company are operating at their highest production capacity, with an annual output of more than 50,000 tons, which is only one-tenth of the 60% of the total needs of the province. In addition to the supply from the Fertilizer Company this year, part of it relies on the distribution from the Taiwan Branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). When the branch distributed the first 3,000 tons of fertilizer shipped from the United States to Taiwan, the people welcomed the branch director Qian in Kaohsiung, which fully illustrates that chemical fertilizer is a necessity for agricultural production in Taiwan. The widespread and skilled use of it has helped to increase agricultural production, which is incomparable with the misunderstanding of the effect of chemical fertilizer by farmers in the interior.

<h3>The Crisis of Hunan Mining</h3>
<p>— October 6th, Changsha Air Dispatch, Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli</p>
<p>Hunan's mining industry is suffering from unprecedented economic downturn, and is constantly in the process of decline. The reasons for the downturn are, firstly, the impact of long-term war; and secondly, the result of the government's eight-year control. As a result, famous mines are mostly in a state of suspension. Although the war has ended and the control policy has recently been abolished by the government, in today's vicious inflation, recovery is still a distant prospect.</p>
<p>Government-Operated Mines</p>
<p>Hunan's metal and non-metal mines are very famous in both domestic and international markets. Such as tungsten, tin, mercury, and realgar, which are very important in the customs trade register, and among them, the production of mercury is not only extremely large, but also the only production area in the Far East. These mineral products are mainly government-operated, with the Construction Department presiding over the majority, but among them, there are also a small number of privately-operated antimony mines and non-metal mines such as coal mines, but the quantity is extremely small, and the capital is not strong enough.</p>
<p>Among the government-operated mines, there are four coal mines, namely, Liling Coal Mine, Qiyang Guanyintan Coal Mine, Xiangtan Yunhuqiao Coal Mine, and Ningxiang Qingxi Coal Mine, which have a history of many years. The reserves of Guanyintan Coalfield and Liling Shimenkou Coalfield are extremely rich. During the war, almost all of them were supplied to the Yuehan and Xianggui railways. Due to limited sales, there was no major development. During the period when Hunan fell, all four mines were suspended, and some of the equipment was severely damaged. After the rehabilitation, the Changjiang River transport was restored. Although the needs of the Yuehan and Xianggui railways will not increase immediately due to the road reconstruction project, the coal shortage in Wuhan made Hunan's coal industry immediately show prosperity. Therefore, the Construction Department began emergency resumption of work, the first step was to repair the important mine shafts, and the second step was to restore all the equipment, but the main work was still pumping water, so that it could immediately resume production. The emergency resumption of work progressed extremely smoothly, and the high price of coal in Wuhan was also one of the reasons for promoting its smooth completion. In just three months, the amount of coal produced by the four mines reached 10,000 tons per month. The situation of private mines is also the same. The urgent market demand naturally caused prosperity, and the abolition of the Coal and Coke Management Office allowed people to operate freely without being restricted, which is very helpful for the future of Hunan's coal industry. However, whether Hunan's coal industry can be prosperous forever is worth studying. The difficulties currently felt by both private and provincial coal mines include two items: 1. Insufficient equipment; 2. Inconvenient transportation. There is currently no clue for the replenishment of equipment. Although the Construction Department has requested the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to supply the required machinery, it is clear that it cannot be discussed at present. The transportation problem is equally serious. Production has increased, but can it be allowed to pile up in the mine? The distance between each mine and the Xiangjiang River is quite far, and the light railway has not been laid. Now it only relies on manpower and a very small number of shallow-water ships, and the transport capacity of the Xiangjiang River will not be immediately improved in today's lack of ships. Therefore, the provincial and private mines are quite anxious about these two problems, and only hope that the government can find ways to improve them, otherwise the current prosperity is just a flash in the pan.</p>
<p>Restoring Realgar Mine</p>
<p>In addition to coal mines, the Construction Department is actively working to restore the realgar mine between Cili and Shimen. Realgar is the realgar wine drunk during the Dragon Boat Festival. Its uses include general folk use as an insecticide, mainly sold to Northeast China and Southeast Asia. The provinces of Northeast China use it as an insecticide and fertilizer powder, while Southeast Asia must spread realgar on the bottom layer when building houses to prevent poisonous insects, and ships at sea must apply realgar to the hull to prevent barnacles from parasitizing and hindering navigation. The uses are extremely extensive. The Cishi realgar mine has been closed for many years. After the rehabilitation, the Construction Department cooperated with private individuals to mine it. The government and businessmen each invested 50 million yuan, and construction started at the end of last year. It is expected to produce 10,000 dan of realgar this year. This mining is scheduled for three years, and the total production will reach 30,000 dan, with considerable income, which is the most profitable type of provincial mining industry.</p>
<p>Lead, Zinc and Silver Mineral Production</p>
<p>In addition to the above two non-metal mineral products, the largest provincial metal mine is the Changning Shuikoushan Lead-Zinc Mine. Lead and zinc are symbiotic minerals, and the two often occur in the same place, and lead ore often contains silver, so it is often called lead-zinc-silver ore. The Changning Shuikoushan mining area is quite famous in China. The Construction Department should have set up a mining bureau there, with a large scale and complete equipment. It has been mining for more than 40 years, and the total amount of mineral sand produced is more than 1.5 million tons. The mining method is extremely modern. There is a light railway for transporting mineral sand, and there is also a modern smelting plant engaged in refining. The ore quality of this mine is extremely high. According to the analysis results, lead ore sand contains 66% lead and 9% zinc. Each ton of ore sand contains 8 to 10 taels of silver. As for zinc ore sand, it contains 46-7% zinc and 5% to 9% lead. At its peak, the number of miners reached 5,000 to 6,000, producing 150 tons of ore sand per day, refining 20 tons of lead, 40 tons of zinc, and 500 taels of silver. In recent years, due to the severance of sea transportation, it was impossible to export, and the output was greatly reduced. When Hunan fell, the mine was occupied by the enemy. The enemy attached great importance to it and originally intended to reopen it. Our side sent planes to destroy all the equipment of the mine, so it was unable to resume work after the victory. Now only a storage office is set up to be responsible for the safekeeping of the remaining equipment, but according to the person in charge of the Construction Department, the ore bed has been impoverished after many years of mining, and it is worth considering whether there is still mining value. It will only be possible to decide whether to resume work after re-drilling, but this is indeed the biggest loss in Hunan.</p>
<p>Tin, Antimony and Mercury Mines</p>
<p>Tin, tungsten, antimony and mercury mines are mineral products controlled by the government during the war, and almost all of them are export goods. However, as a result of the control, almost all mines were shut down. Tin is produced in Jianghua, Linwu and other places, and is necessary for military industry. Hunan's tin mines rank third in the country, and the ore is divided into placer tin and rock tin. The territory of Jianghua, Daoxian, and Ningyuan counties in Hunan is the main production area of ​​placer tin in the country. Although the reserves are not large, at its peak, it produced more than 10,000 market dans of pure tin every year. In recent years, it has been subject to government control, and it takes two or three months to review and price, so that the official price is far from the cost, and because of inconvenient transportation, the mines have closed down one after another, and the number of unemployed workers has reached 10,000 to 20,000. Recently, the government has abolished the control, but it is not possible to restore the old view in the short term.</p>
<p>The Authority of the Antimony Market</p>
<p>As for antimony mines, they are not only a specialty of Hunan, but also have the authority to influence the world's antimony market. China's antimony production accounts for about 80% of the total production, and Hunan's production accounts for more than 90% of the country's production, so it is a very promising mineral product. Hunan's antimony mines are distributed in 18 counties including Xinhua, Yiyang, Anhua, Shaoyang, Xiangxiang, Wugang, Xinning, Dong'an, Yuanling, and Chenxi, with the Xikuangshan in Xinhua being the most famous. The antimony ore in Xikuangshan is stibnite, with an antimony content of more than 50%. During the First World War, there were more than 100 companies and smelters mining antimony ore in the area, with more than 10,000 miners. The monthly output of pure antimony was as high as more than 20,000 tons. In recent years, the antimony industry in the area has declined, but the monthly output of pure antimony is still 1,000 to 2,000 tons, most of which are shipped to Shanghai and Hong Kong for sale overseas. During the war, the government purchased the controlled exports. The mine owners felt unprofitable. Last month, representatives of various mines gathered in Changsha to request the government to take measures to increase the purchase price. Recently, the Resources Committee approved the price of pure antimony to be increased by an additional subsidy of 180,000 yuan per ton on the original price of 320,000 yuan, for a total of 500,000 yuan. However, it is still very far from the black market price in Shanghai. The mine owners believe that the wartime control policy has become a thing of the past, and the government should abolish the control, so that they can freely develop and should no longer compete with the people for profit. Therefore, they plan to petition the government recently to achieve the goal of abolishing the control.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned mines are the largest and most promising mines in Hunan. Since the situation is so bad, other mines such as gold mines, manganese mines, and tungsten mines are also the same. The reason is due to the impact of the war, but the government's control is not reasonable. At this time, it is difficult to develop due to the restrictions of the facts, but how to cultivate vitality so that it will not fall into complete stagnation and closure should be worked hard at this time. Private capital is limited, and industrial and mining loans are right in name but not in reality, which is also the most distressing problem for Hunan mine owners.</p>
<h3>Eloquent Councilors and Impassioned Oratory: A Glimpse of the Kyoto-Nanking Assembly</h3>
<p>— October 29th, Nanking Dispatch from Our Correspondent Ding Kuanghua</p>
<p>The popularly elected councilors of Kyoto City are in place, and immediately following the election, the final session of the provisional city council convened on the 25th at the Nanjing Municipal Government Auditorium. A gathering of distinguished figures assembled in one hall. Mayor Ma, upon opening the session, with a tone of benevolence, bestowed a considerable stimulus to those (both men and women) who had not been elected. He stated, "The city government had hoped that all members would be elected in this election, but the result was only sixty percent, which is deeply regretted. However, we hope that everyone can join in the work of construction from now on." Upon hearing this, the forty percent of unsuccessful candidates considered it a public insult, significantly affecting their pride. Thus, "seizing the opportunity," criticism of municipal governance immediately became the central issue.</p>
<p>After Heated Debate on Lifting the Dance Ban, the Original Resolution Is Upheld</p>
<p>The Nanking dance ban can be said to have been initiated by a major editorial in the Central Daily News, during a time when austerity measures were being implemented. Mayor Ma, fearing criticism, had to resolutely impose the ban. Dance hall proprietors, their livelihoods shattered, were unwilling to concede, and made several requests to lift the ban during the provisional council sessions. The council found itself in a dilemma, needing to represent public opinion while also considering the government's measures. Naturally, a firm decision was difficult to make. It was generally agreed that dancing is a form of entertainment, and permitting it under the principle of "managing without prohibiting, enjoying without excess" would not be entirely unacceptable. However, despite repeated lobbying by the dance hall proprietors, the authorities remained unyielding, refusing their requests. This time, with the convening of the provisional council, the dance hall proprietors believed they couldn't miss the opportunity and made another request. When the provisional council put it to a general assembly for discussion, it sparked a heated debate. Councilor Li Jianhong stated, "Considering the livelihood of the dancers, before banning dancing, we should provide them with a legitimate means of making a living. Dancing itself is not a sin, and proper entertainment should be promoted." Councilor Zhuang Maoru, on the other hand, argued that the negative aspects of dancing were numerous and advocated for a strict prohibition. Councilor Huang Luming stated, "In Europe and America, dancing is a form of etiquette and is inherently good, but it changes when it comes to China. Therefore, the principle should be not to prohibit dancing, but to manage it strictly." Councilor Zhang Wenbo solemnly stated, "This council's decision to ban dancing was an act in response to a national policy, as today's [situation] is filled with [hardship], and we must not be excessively licentious." Other councilors, such as Wang Yizhai, from a commercial standpoint, sympathized with the requests of the dance hall proprietors and advocated for managing without prohibiting. Councilor Sun Yulin stated that if the dance ban was a legal matter, the municipal government should be requested to report the basis of the law. The arguments were varied and inconclusive. Director Chen Jianru, in his capacity as the responsible official, delivered his "rearguard" speech. He stated, "The municipal government's dance ban was in accordance with the provisional council's resolution. At that time, there were too many dancers in Nanking, and social interaction was too excessive, which indeed affected public morals, and public opinion was highly critical. As for the dance hall proprietors' argument that the municipal government issued business licenses beforehand and should not ban them afterward, according to the law, once a new law is established, the old law naturally becomes invalid. Therefore, the municipal government's enforcement of the dance ban is naturally legal." At this point in the discussion, the chairman proposed a vote, and the result was to uphold the original resolution, "Strictly prohibiting dance halls." The councilors who advocated for dancing could only lament in vain, and at this point, like the dancers, they were coldly helpless.</p>
<p>Unequal Zoning of Power Outages: Plant Director Lu Admits Mistake</p>
<p>The Capital Electric Power Plant's generating boilers are quite dilapidated and in need of repair. To meet demand, repairs were initiated in October, and during the repair period, only zoned power outages could be implemented. Since its implementation, it has failed to satisfy the citizens. Lu Fazeng, the director of the Capital Electric Power Plant, came to the provisional council to report on operations. The councilors were not about to let him off easy. Councilor Sun Yulin's oral inquiry was probing, he said, "Why are the zoned power outages not fair? There are reasons why Huangpu Road and [Jiang]jiawan are not affected by power outages, as the former is the location of the Ministry of National Defense, related to national defense, and it is inconvenient to have power outages. The latter is the location of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, related to foreign affairs, and it is inconvenient to have power outages. However, the Shanxi Road area is neither related to national defense nor related to foreign affairs, so why is it not included in the power outage zone? Is it because it is the residence of important figures, and it is inconvenient to have power outages? Please, Director Lu, answer!" At this moment, Director Lu's face was flushed and he was extremely embarrassed. He stuttered and responded, "Regarding that point, I am not comfortable answering. Everyone knows who lives in the Shanxi Road area... "The councilors were extremely dissatisfied with this answer. Sun Yulin, Zhuang Maoru, Wang Guohong, and Yang Dewen pressed him for an answer. Director Lu could only say, "Everyone, please don't pressure me. It was all a mistake by one person named Lu. You can punish me in any way you want." His words were filled with despair. In the end, it was simply left unresolved.</p>

After getting to know each other, as long as the other party gives her a little joy, such as watching movies, going to parks, etc., and repeatedly treats her, making her feel that the other party seems to be considerate and seems to have fallen in love with her, because the girlhood has a naive, and can also be said to be innocent, mind; and does not understand the truth of this evil society.</p>
<p>"Lover" is here, although he does not have much talent, but because he often treats and is considerate, she can't bear to lose him again. This kind of first love is often wrong, and the result is entering the grave of love.</p>
<p>If it is really like this (it is seen a lot in society), then her life will be buried. After marriage, life is mostly unhappy, and many new opportunities that she should have are also abandoned from then on.</p>
<p>Then how should we have true love? How can she realize her future hopes? How can there be true happiness? Perhaps this series of questions will be asked by innocent young ladies? So, now I will give you a simple answer:</p>
<p>(1) When choosing an object, you must not be sloppy because of temporary needs. You should choose strictly. For example, what is the personality of this person? Are future expectations the same as mine? Do I have sincere friendship?</p>
<p>(2) Love is not a game. You can use treating and playing games to increase friendship. If you think this kind of attitude is right, then the future will definitely not be "happiness" but a "grave".</p>
<p>(3) During love, both parties should have a natural and sincere heart to observe each other whether we are suitable. Don't decorate the surface falsely. If you decorate falsely now, it will be the most distressing thing to "show the original form" after marriage. When emotions diverge, you lose happiness!</p>
<p>I won't nag too much. Young ladies, you should pay attention to what is true, good, and beautiful, and be cautious about your demands for first love!</p>
<h3>When a Child Is Sick</h3>
<p>— Yang Yongzhang</p>
<p>(1) Children Really Do Get Sick</p>
<p>Eating a few more pieces of cream cake can actually cause indigestion in children; a popsicle, under certain circumstances, can also cause severe stomach pain and diarrhea in children; in the hot summer, after a long time of not getting sweet dew, suddenly a burst of heavy rain falls, and when others are cheering and thinking that the weather can be relatively cool, the child gets a cold because he forgot to put on an extra piece of clothing, so his nose runs, he coughs, he has a fever, and it makes him stay in bed for three or four days.</p>
<p>A glass placed properly on the table is grabbed by a five- or six-year-old child and used as a toy, but if the child is not careful and falls to the ground, the glass breaks and his head also breaks.</p>
<p>From a medical point of view, the morbidity and mortality rates of children are indeed higher than those of adults. Children under the age of fourteen are far inferior to adults in terms of physical development and physiological function. Due to weak resistance and lack of knowledge, children are always prone to illness. Acute infectious diseases such as measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and meningitis have taken away many precious young lives. Other common diseases such as nutritional disorders and gastrointestinal disorders greatly threaten the health of children. Most children are gluttonous, and some ignorant children often swallow the discarded watermelon peels and banana peels of others as delicacies. Many inexplicable things can be found in the mouths of children. "Illness enters through the mouth" This sentence seems to be specifically said to children. Also, colds, coughs, bronchitis, and pneumonia are almost unavoidable for every child. This is because the respiratory organs of children are particularly fragile. Other illnesses caused by accidental events, such as internal injuries and external injuries, cannot be considered few.</p>
<p>There is really too much, you can hear people saying everywhere: "Brother Zhang is having an attack", "Sister Li is having chills"... In short, children really do get sick.</p>
<p>(2) Only Be Anxious, Not Panicked</p>
<p>What to do when a child is sick? This is the problem that needs to be solved immediately after the child gets sick; especially the mother, she is particularly concerned about her baby - the child, and is deeply afraid that an accident will happen. Here is not to tell you what to do when a child has pneumonia, or what to do when a child has acute enteritis, what medicine to take, what injection to get, because this is basically impossible. I will only put forward a few central ideas, which are very popular.</p>
<p>When a child is unfortunately sick, first of all, don't panic. We should carefully observe his symptoms and act carefully. Do not panic yourself and lose your mind. Many children's illnesses may not be hopeless if they are properly treated and cared for. Calmness is really indispensable for every mother. Panicking is certainly unnecessary, but you cannot be indifferent. Some parents do not care about their children at all. Once the child is sick, they are neither panicked nor anxious, and unintentionally plant a huge disaster, which they will regret later. Many acute infectious diseases often end the child's life in a short period of time, so whether it is a cold, cough, or stomach pain, it should not be ignored. What to do when a child is sick? Remember, only be anxious, not panicked.</p>
<p>(3) Do Not Use Medications Randomly</p>
<p>It is certainly a good thing for a child to take some aspirin for a headache, but not all headaches can be cured with aspirin.</p>
<p>Now, Xiaozhilong and penicillin can no longer be regarded as the secret magic weapons of doctors. Because everyone knows these drugs. Some people (not doctors) often say: "A certain medicine is very good, give him a little." In fact, he does not understand anything about a certain medicine, and seems to understand but does not understand. Losing money is a small matter, and sometimes it can cause adverse results. Therefore, I think that when a child is sick, unless you have considerable confidence and experience, never use medications randomly, and make the child eat many unnecessary sufferings, especially do not watch advertisements and take medications, thinking that a child will be cured by drinking a bottle of cough medicine. Before taking medicine, it is best to consult with a doctor and ask for their opinion, so as not to lose money and ruin the opportunity for treatment.</p>
<p>(4) Seek Help From Reliable Doctors</p>
<p>Doctors are the protectors of patients. When a child is sick, the mother should find a reliable doctor to seek his help. Unfortunately, China's medical industry is really too depressed. There are many "doctors" who are no different from profit-seeking merchants. They have learned the method of making money and have forgotten their noble and sacred position and responsibility. But it must also be said that there are still many doctors who have a spirit of sacrifice and love.</p>
<p>I hope that after a child is sick, the mother should not ask doctors randomly. Many wealthy people often think that they have a lot of money, and they often lose faith in doctors, which is a big mistake. A doctor with rich knowledge and experience, coupled with moral cultivation, is the most ideal. We should listen to the doctor's instructions and act according to their words.</p>
<p>(5) Prevention is Better Than Cure</p>
<p>As the Western saying goes: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." After a child gets sick, parents should find out the cause of the disease and try to remove it to avoid the recurrence of the tragedy. Many children's diseases can be avoided, especially gastrointestinal diseases and respiratory diseases. As long as you pay attention to the child's usual health care, there will always be good results. The injection of preventive needles and the vaccination of cowpox are valuable for the prevention of diseases.</p>
<p>In the family, children should be fully instilled with common sense of hygiene, and they should be encouraged to develop athletic skills, so that their diet and daily life have certain rules, and they should have more contact with sunlight and fresh air, and have appropriate exercise and rest every day. With a healthy body, the resistance to diseases can at least be increased. What to do when a child is sick? Hey, it's best to prevent them from getting sick!</p>
<h3>The Sick Child Still Misses Toys</h3>
<h3>Quarrel</h3>
<p>— Li Ying</p>
<p>Quarreling is an extremely common occurrence. Friends, fathers and sons, siblings, and married couples all quarrel, especially married couples, where the possibility of quarreling is greatest. Why is this? Let me analyze it in detail:</p>
<p>A. Causes of Quarrels</p>
<p>The relationship between husband and wife is the closest and most intimate among all human relationships. Because they share morning and evening together, each other's shortcomings and mistakes can be discovered at any time. During the period before marriage or the early stages of marriage, both parties tend to accommodate and tolerate each other. Gradually, as time passes, what is known as "familiarity breeds contempt" arises, especially if one party is fond of talking too much, has an eccentric temperament, or peculiar hobbies, it is inevitable that quarrels will arise. Common examples include:</p>
<p>(1) Both parties in a marriage discover each other's shortcomings, their wills are incompatible, their temperaments clash, and they harbor differing opinions, leading to quarrels;</p>
<p>(2) One of the parties in the marriage develops affections for someone else and becomes dissatisfied with their current partner, using any pretext to achieve their goal of divorce;</p>
<p>(3) Under the influence of some form of stimulus or excessive drinking, the person's mind becomes muddled, leading to unreasonable quarrels;</p>
<p>(4) Some people believe that quarreling is an interesting thing and often use "quarreling" to spice up the mundane and monotonous life of the married couple.</p>
<p>B. Methods of Quarrels</p>
<p>There are many ways to quarrel. Quarreling differs between wealthy families and humble thatched huts, and it also differs between those with education and cultivation and those who are uneducated and uncouth. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into:</p>
<p>(1) In large families under feudal ethics, the husband is often tyrannical and unreasonable, and the wife can only cry silently, entrusting all her experiences to fate. This situation is becoming increasingly rare in today's society.</p>
<p>(2) This is the most common scenario: first, they scold chickens and dogs, then they argue and fight. As a result, the man runs away outside, and the woman returns to her parents' home. There are also cases of rude attitudes and physical violence, resulting in both parties being hurt.</p>
<p>(3) The worst way is to smash things, such as cherished vases, plaster statues, daily necessities like hot water bottles, glass cups, etc. At the moment of anger, people's anger surges to the sky, and they feel a little better after throwing things. In reality, it's not worth it at all. If you smash something today, you have to buy it tomorrow, resulting in financial loss and mental suffering. What's the point?</p>
<p>(4) In extreme cases, when quarrels reach a point where "greed obscures reason," someone might even "murder their husband," which is not unheard of, as history has proven.</p>
<p>C. Results of Quarrels</p>
<p>The result of a quarrel is often reconciliation, but sometimes it leads to divorce. However, divorce is not a simple transaction! Each quarrel between husband and wife creates more distance in their relationship. Those who like to smash things and tear clothes are wasting money, which only benefits the shop owners. It would be better to tear up banknotes instead. Furthermore, quarrels should not happen too often, as the worst thing is when the quarrel becomes "habitual" and uncontrollable. My friend and his wife were more loving than anyone else when they were newly married. Later, they had small quarrels every three days and big quarrels every five days. Today, they quarrel all the time, every moment. They quarrel while eating, and they quarrel while dressing. Both parties feel pain. This is what it means to quarrel habitually and not take it seriously.</p>
<p>D. Remedies for Quarrels</p>
<p>(1) Try to avoid quarreling as much as possible, especially the first time. When the other party is getting angry, calm yourself down and be patient. If the other party is right, quickly admit your mistake. If the other party is wrong and being unreasonable, then wait until the other party has vented their anger, and then use a gentle tone to explain things tactfully, making the other party realize their mistake on their own. The most important thing to avoid is public brawls, as everyone has their own self-esteem, and adding fuel to the fire will only make it burn brighter. You are husband and wife, what is there to be ashamed or embarrassed about? If both parties think back to the feelings they had during their initial love or early marriage, even a heart of stone would not ignite!</p>
<p>(2) If the temperaments of both parties are truly incompatible, then you should take a step back and think: you are already married, so just muddle through. The husband likes the smell of fish, but you feel nauseous as soon as you smell it. However, if you think: this is something that your loved one likes, then you will feel that the fishy smell has a special flavor.</p>
<p>(3) In fact, if the husband and wife really cannot get along any longer, then the man might as well go out and do his work alone, and the woman can also spend a period of time alone—it must be alone and single. After a few days, the man will miss his wife, and the woman will think about her husband. They will surely both admit that living together as husband and wife is more comfortable, happier, and more "meaningful" than being alone.</p>
<p>In short, quarreling between husband and wife is an unavoidable thing. However, one must find the possible within the impossible. The most important thing between husband and wife is mutual tolerance and understanding, and mutual love. Not only can quarreling be avoided, but these two principles are also necessary for maintaining genuine affection.</p>

<h3>The Opera of Dream of the Red Chamber</h3>
<p>— Ye Dejun</p>
<p>After Gao E's continuation of the one hundred and twenty chapter edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber" was published in the late Qianlong period, many continuations were written during the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods. At present, there are fourteen known versions. At the same time, there were also many adaptations of "Dream of the Red Chamber" into operas. "Dream of the Red Chamber" can be said to have been extremely popular at that time. Regarding the zaju and chuanqi of "Dream of the Red Chamber", only three types are generally known, as described in Aoki Masaru's "History of Modern Chinese Opera." But in fact, there are more than that, at least the following types:</p>
<p>"Romance of the Dream of the Red Chamber," written by Zhong Yunjian, published in the fourth year of Jiaqing (Yiwei year). The book is divided into two volumes: the upper volume has thirty-two acts, and the lower volume has twenty-four acts. It was written based on the original and continuation books of "Dream of the Red Chamber" and was the most widely circulated. The four acts recorded in the "Collection of Music Scores" are selected from this book. Yang Maojian's "Chang'an Watching Flowers Record" and Liang Tingnan's "Vine Flower Song Talk" Volume 3 have recorded it, and Liang praised it highly. Yunjian's name is unknown, he was known as the Woodcutter of the Red Bean Village, a native of Suzhou, and was formerly a disciple of Ao (above seen in the original book's inscription and signature), his life is unknown.</p>
<p>"Awakening from Stone" (also known as "Dream of the Red Chamber"), written by Wan Rongen, published by Xiangxin Bookstore in the eighth year of Jiaqing (Guihai year) (collection of the Peking Library, not seen), Mr. Zheng Zhenduo has a manuscript copy (see Xidi's Bibliography of Rare Opera Books). The book is divided into two parts: "Xiaoxiang Lament" and "Yihong Joy," the former has four collections of thirty-six acts, and the latter has two collections of twenty-four acts. Yao Xie's "Examination of Present Music" (10), "Outline of Dream of the Red Chamber" records it. Wan Rongen, courtesy name Yuqing, styled Xinqing Jushi, was a native of Jiangning and was good at painting. In addition to this book, his other opera work is "The Exile Flower Tower," see Feng Jinbo's "Ink Fragrance Residence Painting Knowledge" Volume 10.</p>
<p>"Dream of the Red Chamber Scattered Suites," written by Jing Shishanmin, published by Chanbo Pavilion in the twentieth year of Jiaqing (Yi Hai year). The book has only sixteen acts: Returning Home, Burying Flowers, Warning Song, Proposing Titles, Listening to Autumn, Sword Meeting, Joint Sentences, Foolish Eulogy, Pin Lament, Sending Love, Walking Demon, Zen Agreement, Burning Manuscripts, Nether Ascension, Complaining of Sorrow, Awakening from Dreams. Each act is about one event and is not continuous, it is a variation of the zaju (this style was popular during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, such as Yang Chao's "Ging Feng Pavilion" thirty-two kinds, Xu Ang's "Writing Heart Zaju" eighteen kinds). "Chang'an Watching Flowers Record," "Vine Flower Song Talk," "Examination of Present Music" (10) are all recorded. Wu Mei's "Outline of Chinese Opera" said that Jing Shishan was Huang Zhaokui, a native of Taicang. "Examination of Present Music" is titled Wu Hao, saying: "Hao is a native of Zhenyang, a student of the Imperial Academy, and has written a 'Collection of Poems and Essays from Jing Shishanfang', 'Examples of Epitaphs and Stone Inscriptions from the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties,' and styled himself Jing Shishanmin." Yao's saying is quite true.</p>
<p>"Dream of the Red Chamber," written by the Master of Flower Rhyme Hermitage, published by Jiamao in the twenty-fourth year of Jiaqing, collection of the Peking Library. One volume, ten acts, also in the zaju category. This book is only recorded in the catalog of the opera music exhibition. According to the Master of Flower Rhyme Hermitage is Shi Yunyu, Shi's courtesy name is Zhiru, styled Zhuotang, Old Man of Independent Learning, Master of Flower Rhyme Hermitage are all other titles, a native of Wuxian, and reached the rank of Shandong Investigating Censor. He wrote nine kinds of zaju "Nine Performances Among Flowers": Fu Sheng Teaching Classics, Luo Fu Picking Mulberry, Tao Ye Crossing the River, Peach Blossom Spring Fisherman, Consort Mei Writing Fu, Letian Opening the Pavilion, Jia Dao Sacrificing Poems, Qin Cao Participating in Zen, Dui Shan Rescuing a Friend (there are original Qianlong editions, Jiaqing reprint editions, and Qing Dynasty miscellaneous operas). Shi's "Complete Collection of Independent Learning and Consideration" fully collects the nine kinds, except for "Dream of the Red Chamber."</p>
<p>"Twelve Hairpins," written by Zhu Fengsen, published in the "Six Songs of Yunshan" edition of Jiaqing. This book is collected in the Peking Library and has not been seen. The opera listings of various families do not record it, only Xu Hongpan's "Three Hairpins Dream" mentions it in the first place. Fengsen's courtesy name is Yunshan, a native of Lingui, his life is unknown. He wrote a total of six operas.</p>
<p>"Three Hairpins Dream," written by Xu Hongpan, in the "Northern Songs of Six View Tower" edition (there are Daoguang and Tongzhi editions). This kind is also a zaju style, and the list of operas has been lost. Xu's other operas include: "Records of the Western Liao," "Goose Hanging Book," "Female Yuntai," "Filial Daughter Saves an Orphan," "Confucian Official Completes the City" five kinds.</p>
<p>"Romance of the Dream of the Red Chamber," written by Chen Zhonglin, there are original Daoguang Han Qingzhai editions and Guangxu sixteenth year reprint editions (there are also popular printed editions). The book has eight volumes and eighty acts, quite long. "Examination of Present Music," "Song Records" are both recorded, "Chang'an Watching Flowers Record," "Miscellaneous Tales of Song Lyrics" are all dissatisfied with his work. According to Chen's courtesy name is Houfu, a native of Yuanhe, a Jinshi in the Jiaqing period, and served as the Hangjiahu Road official, specializing in model essays.</p>
<p>"New Songs of the Red Chamber," written by Yan Baoyong, written around the third and fourth years of Daoguang. This book has not been seen in the present passing down editions, "Examination of Present Music" (Four) Qing Zaju department records it. According to Yan Baoyong's courtesy name is Danchang, styled Wenqiao, a native of Dantu, and served as the Qixia magistrate of Shandong. His written zaju include: "Waiting for Husband Stone" (four acts), "Guinu Feng" (six acts), there are popular printed editions handed down. "Examination of Present Music" additionally records six kinds (including this one): "Meng Lan Dream" (extant), "Same Heart Words," "Strange Flower Mirror" (the above two kinds and new songs are also seen in Jiang Baoling's "Ink Forest Present Words" Volume Eleven), "Swallowing Felt to Repay," "Double Smoke Record," the last four kinds have not been seen in the present passing down editions. Although this kind has not been seen in the present passing down editions, Liang Zhangju's "Continued Talks on Olive Couplets" Volume 4 briefly recorded this play: "Yan Wenqiao said: Between Guiwei and Jiajin in the Daoguang period, I stayed in the capital for the imperial examination, and I often made new songs in my spare time and entrusted them to the pear garden to sing, which moved the people of that time, and many people took me as a teacher. I once had a sentence that said: 'I occasionally make a stage play, and I actually burden people to be concerned about it nationwide,' which is true. ... He also said: The 'Red Chamber' zaju I made, among which there is an act about scarves, describing the marriage of Hua Xiren to Jiang Yuhan. When it was about to be staged, the song master came to ask: 'Setting up a new room on the stage,' still lacking a couplet on a plaque, begging for a writing of it." I immediately wrote the four characters "Jade Soft Flower Delicate" as the plaque. I repeatedly thought about the antithetical couplet but could not understand it, and while I was hesitating, I suddenly saw two young actors arriving, who were his disciples: one named Tianshou, styled Meisheng; one named Xianshou, styled Yuesheng, who were studying this play together, and with their affections in mind, they formed a couplet: "Good sons and daughters, Heaven and Immortals with double longevity," "Small reunion, eyebrows and moon for three lives."</p>
<p>The operas of "Dream of the Red Chamber" that are currently known are the above-listed eight kinds. Wang Guowei's "Song Records" also recorded one written by Gao Lanshu based on "Miscellaneous Tales of Song Lyrics." According to Volume 3 of "Miscellaneous Tales," Zhang Wentao's poem states; he mistakenly took Gao E's continuation of "Dream of the Red Chamber" as an opera, and "Song Records" therefore mistakenly included it.</p>
<h3>Portrait of Chairman Chiang (Sculpture)</h3>
<h3>Listening to the Sani Songs of the Local People in Lunan - with a Preface</h3>
<p>— Zhao Chengbo</p>
<p>General Zhao Chengbo followed Sun Yat-sen in the revolution and served as a military advisor in the Grand Marshal's Office. For forty years, he has repeatedly performed military feats, while also possessing talent in both literature and military affairs, and his knowledge encompasses both Chinese and Western learning. His poems, lyrics, and parallel prose are truly outstanding. The Yunnan Provincial Party Department is performing borderland song and dance, which is Sani song. Sun Xizhi. Lunan Mile, with its strange mountains and waters, in the months of late winter, the weather is clear and bright, the ice and snow are just melting, the reeds and rushes have grown long, the cool breeze is gentle, and the white dew has not yet frosted. Calling friends and bringing companions, we travel to this famous state; the local customs are elegant, and the rhymes are melodious; looking at the past from the present, the ancient tunes are vast and distant, vulgar sounds compete, and elegant music is completely lost. After the loss of rites, we seek compensation from the wild. The residents are Sani people, building earthen houses, their clothing is simple and unadorned, and their customs are like those of the Tang Dynasty. They rest at sunset and are busy at sunrise, living a muddled life, wandering leisurely; like the land of Peach Blossom Spring, and the paradise of Huaxu. Traveling to this scenic spot, from the end of winter to the beginning of spring, early flowers show their beauty, and new water exudes fragrance; the host and guests are indistinguishable, and chickens and dogs forget each other; hunters set their nets, and silkworm girls hold their baskets. The spring breeze blows green, and the autumn frost withers yellow. In the depths of winter, they sun their backs, and in the heat of summer, they carry their bags. In the east, north, and wild, they drunkenly drink a thousand cups; men and women sit together in a state of free and righteous emperors; Yang Baihua tunes, and He Manzi melodies, they come to seek happiness, and take this as their home.</p>
<p>Suddenly the color of the journey is urgent and the sky will be dark. Finding a mountain and water country by the Long Lake; not knowing if our people are happy villagers, the furnace smoke and salt are vast north of Songping. The mountains encircle the flatlands, and the pine wind falls to an end, the wind sends the palace and merchants' tunes that are not yet finished, the traces of sound and moon gorge, and the reeds and flowers are white, the brilliance is still vaguely unattainable; a path leads through the green mountains by the water, the autumn scenery in front of the village is red with evening maples, this place has never had a Jiazi year, flowers bloom and fall, passing through chaos. Farming mountains and fishing in the water, fishing nets and hunting bows; in Utopia, in the ideal country; working hard, morning and evening; beautiful myriad trees of flowers, towering thousands of piles of stones, the moon is bright on the top of Wangmao Mountain, the sons and daughters in the village are heartbroken; there is no intention of summoning the soul, but there is a natural thought of weeping leaves and grieving flowers. The earth fire burns fiercely, hurting the listening guests, the sound rises and draws silk, suddenly tearing silk, the northern ballad is suitable for激唱，南骚楚舞 emphasizes low拍; Yi's sleeves are full of tears, how should the wild people's clothing mourn? Do not ask Liu Ruan of Tiantai, the peach blossom faces are ambiguous.</p>
<h3>Record of Zhao Jingshen</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Some years ago, I read Mr. Jingshen's "Silhouettes of Literary Figures." I had long admired his frequent contact with literary figures and the depth of his friendships. After the victory, I saw his "Impressions of Literary Figures," which added to my admiration for him. In these decades, on this literary scene, to be able to firmly hold one's position, never shaken by external forces, but instead strengthening his fighting spirit because of the sacred war of resistance, Jingshen can be considered one to be mentioned.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as one pays a little attention to the situation of the literary scene since the literary movement, everyone knows Mr. Jingshen's loyalty to this work of literature. During his time at Nankai Middle School in Tianjin, perhaps even earlier than this, Jingshen had already committed himself to literature. Since then, he has been cautious, working tirelessly, only moving forward, never falling behind. First, he explored folk tales, then he introduced news from the world literary scene. In recent years, he has been researching opera and novels, and even jokes, burying himself in hard work, diligently and tirelessly. His old excavations and new discoveries have had a considerable impact on the literary scene. In particular, his introduction of "Chekhov's Masterpieces" is an immortal undertaking in the field of Chinese translation literature. His perseverance and sustained dedication should put to shame those introducers of Western literature who are fickle and opportunistic!</p>
<p>Once, he gave a lecture at Daxia University. A narrow classroom was so crowded that even the windows were full of people. It was truly a sea of people, with thousands of heads jostling. Mr. Jingshen's humorous lecture, coupled with his dancing hands, earned him countless applause! This matter is more than ten years ago, but it still leaves a deep impression in our minds, and it will not be erased in the future!</p>
<p>Mr. Jingshen is most known for his tireless efforts in supporting younger generations. Almost all the active writers on today's literary scene have had a relationship with Mr. Jingshen. In particular, "Youth World," which he still edits, has unearthed countless young writers. He is frank, straightforward, and does what he says... all the characteristics of a good person can be found in him. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, with a heart of loyalty and filial piety to the nation and the country, he escaped from the enemy's close surveillance and went to Dabie Mountain in western Anhui to continue serving the country's cultural and educational work. This spirit of perseverance and hardship is no less than that of a soldier fighting the enemy on the front line!</p>
<p>Writer's Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Mark Twain on Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>The American novelist and humorist Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), once had a heated debate with a friend about quitting smoking. The friend said that quitting smoking was extremely difficult, but he said it was quite easy. So he used his experience to explain, saying: "What's so difficult about quitting smoking! I have experience, I'll tell you: I myself have quit more than a thousand times, is that considered difficult?"</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 83</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Humph!" This is a nasal sound peculiar to the Japanese. Sure enough, it was immediately followed by a rustling and heavy voice scolding "Ba ga ×××". Although this sound was separated by the wall, it could be heard that the distance from where we were sitting was at most three or four yards. Before the scolding stopped, we also heard the barking of a dog, mixed with human voices. After a while, the barking gradually increased, barking and whimpering, mixed with heavy footsteps, stomping and stomping, and the sound of the dog's paws scratching the gravel on the ground. These complex sounds, put together, can clearly be imagined, as if someone was leading a large ferocious dog; the dog was struggling with the leash, wanting to run forward, and the person holding the leash was pulling it back with all his might, not letting the dog run.</p>
<p>The man and the dog, one struggling forward and the other dragging back, made a fuss for a while, and then suddenly heard the man shouting loudly, and at the same time heard as if he had kicked the dog. The dog, after being kicked, only howled once, but did not stop struggling, but struggled closer and closer to where we were sitting, and there was also the sound of fierce jumping. Judging from this situation, I determined that someone must be leading a mad dog and walking towards us. The dog's sense of smell is sharp, perhaps it smelled our scent, so it wanted to break free from the rope that was tethering it, jump over the wall, and attack us. However, because no one had ever crossed the border here, the Japanese were careless, so the person leading the dog did not think that there was someone outside the wall, only thinking that the dog had suddenly become wild and disobedient. Therefore, he only wanted to restrain the dog, and did not want to check the wall.</p>
<p>I guessed this situation, and felt a chill rise up my spine. Subconsciously, I reached out and grabbed Tiger Brother's arm, and at the same time turned my head to look at Tiger Brother. At this time, Tiger Brother also realized what was happening on the other side of the wall. He was also listening very carefully with his ears pricked up. In the dim light, I saw that there was no trace of fear on his round little face.</p>
<p>The person and the dog on the other side of the wall made a fuss for a while, and gradually calmed down. Finally, only a series of sounds like "pish pish" were heard, as if a whip or leather strap was being used to whip the dog. While whipping, he muttered, and the dog howled softly twice after being whipped. Only then did the movements and sounds of the person and the dog stop. It was quiet for a long time before a "chih" sound was heard, right behind us, as if a match had been struck. It was at this time that the searchlight swept over again, flashing past in front of us.</p>
<p>The searchlight swept over and past three times in a row; the movements were very uniform, and the interval between each sweep and flash seemed to be a certain amount of time. I suddenly realized that this searchlight was not the kind used by the military, but the kind used by maritime lighthouses, which automatically rotated. I estimated the time, and it seemed that every six or seven minutes or so, it rotated a circle. What was the purpose of installing this kind of light here? I think the biggest purpose is probably a kind of vigilance; perhaps on that bridge, there are occasional sentries on the lighthouse looking around with binoculars, using the light to look around, fearing a sneak attack: at the same time, it also lets people know that there is security in this restricted area. Realizing this point, I felt a lot more relieved and reduced a lot of tension.</p>
<p>After the light swept past for a while, I suddenly heard the dog panting again; immediately afterwards, the heavy footsteps, with a rhythm, sounded again, really walking behind us. At this time, if it suddenly stopped, needless to say, we must have been discovered outside the wall.

<h3>Handling of Trust</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Trust Bureau, entrusted by the Handling Bureau, is bidding to sell enemy and puppet real estate for the second time. If it follows the Trust Bureau's method, at least 10,000 or more citizens will be driven to the streets without a home. I don't want to say angry words (the realistic purpose of life is nothing more than seeking food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. If there is no place to accommodate oneself, it is actually right to be angry!). I am willing to calmly and rationally discuss the matter. Now, I will comment on the remarks made by the person in charge of the Trust Bureau and the Handling Bureau (in fact, the heads of the bureaus are the same person).</p>
<p>The Trust Bureau said: "The purpose of handling this business is to serve, and the problems that arise directly are not what this bureau wants to handle." It completely pushes the responsibility away cleanly, meaning that it is only responsible for selling, as for whether it can be sold, whether it can be sold, or whether there are other disputes after the sale, it cannot be managed.</p>
<p>As for the Handling Bureau, the Handling Bureau said: "For all the houses that have been bid on, the original residents should be maintained first, that is, based on the original owner's lease agreement as the standard, it is absolutely not the case that the owner who won the bid can order the residents to move out. If the original lease has long expired, of course, another notice should be made..."</p>
<p>This passage is very grand and plausible at first glance, but it is actually equivalent to saying nothing. Why? Taking the thirty-nine units that were bid on this time as an example, either the leases had long expired, or they were occupied by civil servants who came from the rear after the victory. They did not get the convenience of "allocation," so where would there be any lease agreements from the original owner? Since it is called enemy and puppet real estate, the original owner is either an enemy (who was sent back to their country) or a puppet (who is in prison), so how can they sign a contract with them? Isn't this clearly a joke?</p>
<p>Shanghai also has real estate transactions, and I have never heard of selling a house and having to drive away the tenants. Could it be that these tenants are also enemies and puppets?</p>
<p>The Trust Bureau wants to sell, and I think the more than 10,000 tenants in these thirty-nine units will definitely not object. The transfer of property rights is because you have no money and cannot afford to buy real estate! However, the original residents' right to lease will not be relaxed at all unless machine guns are used to shoot them. Therefore, I said yesterday: If the presiding authorities do not consider it again, it will lead to unexpected events.</p>
<p>In fact, it is very simple, as long as the Handling Bureau announces: This sale of houses is a transfer of property rights, and the original residents have the priority to rent, then there will be no disputes. However, can our hardworking, meritorious, and wise Handling Bureau handle it in such a clear and straightforward way?</p>

<h3>Concerning "Sadism"</h3>
<p>— Mai Ye</p>
<p>Have you noticed? A few days ago, this newspaper's international news page carried a shocking Reuters dispatch from London dated the 16th: "Former Air Force pilot Heath, originally a handsome youth, was hanged today at Pentonville Prison for sadism, having killed two women. This is a shocking case in British history. The offender first murdered film actress Mrs. Garner. The victim's naked body was found in his room at a London hotel on June 21st of this year. Her feet were bound, and her chest and back were whipped in seventeen places. There were teeth marks on her body, and she had been severely mutilated with an instrument resembling fire tongs. Less than two weeks after this case, he killed a beautiful young woman named Marshall in a similarly sadistic manner at Ben Endis Beach. Her corpse was found in a tomb near the coast, also with bite marks and whipping marks on her body."</p>
<p>"Sadism," called "Sadism" in English, is also translated as "abuse-related sexual perversion." From a psychological perspective, it undoubtedly belongs to a kind of abnormal psychology and pathological behavior. To put it simply: a sadist must inflict pain on their beloved (whether the love is mutual or one-sided) in order to feel satisfied and pleasure, and the more pain they inflict, the happier they become. The actions of the airman mentioned in the telegram above are typical examples.</p>
<p>However, in the process of love between the sexes, there are often very mild "sadistic" behaviors, which are often not considered unusual by ordinary people. For example, as described in old novels: the "talented scholar" would pluck a strand of hair from the "beautiful woman's" head as a souvenir, or the man would bite the woman's finger, even drawing blood, in order to feel pain. Or, they would bite each other's arms as an oath; or playfully slap their lover's face in mock anger... all of these are manifestations of "sadism," differing only in degree. The foot-binding of the Qing Dynasty, or the saying "King Chu loved slender waists" leading to many deaths by starvation in the palace, is also a manifestation of sadism.</p>
<p>Castration - Necrophilia</p>
<p>Castration, necrophilia... these kinds of terrible, cruel acts also belong to "sadism." Twelve or thirteen years ago, a sensational crime occurred in Tokyo, Japan, mobilizing national newspapers, broadcasting stations, and police networks, which were able to capture the female criminal through joint efforts. According to her subsequent confession: she loved that man very much, but she wanted to possess him, permanently and securely, so she had to strangle him to death. An even more terrible manifestation of cruelty was that she cut off the man's genitals. After committing the crime, she fled to many places. Many days later, when she was captured, the package containing what she had cut off was still treasured in her bosom. She was not like an ordinary madman; once the cruelty had passed, all her thinking and reactions returned to normal. At the time, some predicted that she would definitely be sentenced to death, but the court accepted the opinion of a psychological expert's examination report and sentenced her to a very, very light crime. However, after leaving prison, she had to live in a mental hospital for a period of time.</p>
<p>Numbness - Satisfaction</p>
<p>The male protagonist Heath mentioned in the telegram above, if he were not a soldier and not tried by military law, he probably would not have been sentenced to hanging.</p>
<p>Similarly belonging to abnormal psychology is so-called "masochism" or "abuse-related sexual gratification," which is a pair of twin brothers with the "sadism" mentioned above. The symptoms of "masochism" are that ordinary sexual stimulation and sexual enjoyment from external sources do not bring satisfaction or even cause numbness. Only by allowing a lover to whip, bite, tear, or even slaughter them as much as possible can they feel supreme interest and satisfaction. "Sadism" is active, while "masochism" is passive, but there is no great difference in essence. Novels say that women feel greater pleasure when a man bites her lip during a kiss, which is the mildest example of "masochism." "Tattoos" and "body art," as well as the nose and ear piercings of uncivilized peoples, also originate from "masochism."</p>
<p>Occasional Thoughts on Current Events</p>
<h3>Military Officers</h3>
<p>— Zhao Lan</p>
<p>The incident of destroying a newspaper office has not completely faded from people's minds; in ××, a troublesome place, two shocking events, the "×× Murder Case" (see the front-line newspaper three days ago) and the "Railway Station Military-Police Conflict Case" (see this newspaper three days ago), have occurred in succession within the past week.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, both of these events were orchestrated by the ×× Brigade stationed in ××. Regarding these, I feel that the ×× Brigade is outrageous!</p>
<p>In the ×× Murder Case, a rickshaw driver ran over and killed a soldier. Logically, the security authorities should investigate the responsibility for the accident and then hand it over to the judicial authorities to be sentenced to the appropriate punishment. That is the proper way. How could they send representatives to the county government to demand compensation for medical expenses, family living expenses, children's education, etc., totaling 120 million yuan? The county government could not come up with this huge sum, so they were deemed to have not given a sincere response, and the rickshaw driver was executed by shooting?</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, let's not discuss whether "regardless of the responsibility for the accident, all drivers are sentenced to death" is the law of the country when a soldier is run over. Just in terms of the rickshaw driver running over the soldier, why should he be subject to military law and be executed by shooting? Does Wuxi not have a court? I am somewhat puzzled!</p>
<p>Regarding the railway station military-police conflict case, this is even more bizarre. Banning soldiers from riding without tickets is a government order! The railway police were carrying out the order and did nothing wrong. Yet this group of ×× Brigade's "××" actually started fighting, destroyed the railway station, seized the railway police's firearms, and injured railway police and senior officials, charging three times as if facing a formidable enemy, using the section headquarters as a target, and firing guns continuously for a day and night! (According to reports, it has not been resolved as of the 2nd)</p>
<p>"Banning riding without tickets" is a national law, and "railway section stations" are national property. Every citizen must strictly abide by national laws! Everyone must do their best to protect national property! However, the "military officers" of the ×× Brigade not only did not abide by national laws, but also destroyed national property! They beat public servants who were serving the country!</p>
<p>For the sake of protecting human rights, implementing national laws, and enforcing military discipline, we should loudly call for correcting this barbaric behavior! Because they are now military officers. If military officers are like this, what will the troops they lead in the future be like!</p>
<p>Let us wait and see the outcome of this incident, because it can be used as a test of military discipline in the future.</p>
<h3>House Numbers · Lane Names · Dust</h3>
<p>— Cai Lin</p>
<p>Many large companies and stores only seek to build magnificent facades, and what architects find most annoying and hate to deal with is a blue-background, white-lettered house number sign, which they find impossible to place properly, so they simply do without it. Therefore, there are many companies and stores in Shanghai whose doors do not have house numbers, and there are even many consecutive doorways without house numbers. If a stranger wants to find the house number there, it is very difficult.</p>
<p>Originally, lanes had lane names with "×× Li," and there were also numbered porcelain signs nailed by the Public Works Bureau. However, many businesses and small factories have opened in the lanes, and the tin signs at the entrances of the lanes are as densely packed as plaques in a temple, completely obscuring the lane names and numbers. If you want to find a certain number in a certain lane, where can you find it?</p>
<p>It is said that the Public Works Bureau is currently working on reorganizing house numbers, and I hope they will pay attention to a few points and find ways to improve or punish those who don't comply.</p>
<p>Before "August 13th," Shanghai's roads had many street sweepers wearing red vests, responsible for cleaning. The terrazzo on the sidewalks was rinsed every day or two, swept clean, and water trucks even circled on the roads all day long. At that time, the roads were "the cleanest," indeed extremely sanitary.</p>
<p>More than a year has passed since the victory, and everything in Shanghai seems to have returned to normal. Now, the only things missing are the water trucks and the street sweepers in red vests. Even if there are any, they may only sweep a few important sections of the road, so "dust accumulates into a tower" everywhere (filthy beyond description). If you run on the road on a windy day, it is like being in the desert area of Mongolia, with gray sand flying, making it impossible to open your eyes. Especially now in late autumn, the fallen leaves on the sidewalks are an inch thick, full of poetic sentiment.</p>
<p>Using air, Shanghai has invented a wind sweeper.</p>
