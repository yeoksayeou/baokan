<h3>協商會憲草組確定　省為最高自治單位　大會可望於明日閉幕</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿五日電〕政治協商會議各分組委會，繼續研討各該組所負責討論之問題，頗見進步。憲草及施政綱領兩組，已入結束階段，憲草組之成就尤多，除政府機關兩院制外，並確定省爲最高自治單位，省制省憲，省長民選，與中央關系均權。據觀察以平行分立之五院行使五權，本爲呆板不靈之辦法，此次五院制之修正，使立法，監察兩院成爲政府機關，足爲憲政前途减少許多糾紛與困難。施政綱領組大部分已獲協議，所餘政府組織部分，亦僅須對厘分之規定續加商討。軍事組則最爲進行之癥結所在，日內或可得一協議，如進行順利，大會將於廿七日行閉幕式。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿五日電〕政治協商會議各分組委會，連日開會，截至廿五日止，計政府組織組開會六次，施政綱領組七次，軍事組四次，憲草組四次，國大組二次，綜合委會一次。頃悉，軍事。憲草兩組今日協商完畢，對各項問題已獲協議，施政綱領組明日亦可望結束，其他各組則尙待繼續協商。又綜合委會原定今日召開第二次會議，惟因多數會員參加軍事組及施政綱領組，時間衝突，故未舉行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿五日電〕在現行政治協商會議之順利結束希望日趨减少聲中，十人綜合組今晨對國共互相衝突之整編計劃謀取妥協辦法。協商會議之所以遭遇暗礁，乃因國民黨不願接受共產黨建立聯合軍事委員會負責整編工作之要求。官方人士稱：政府改組因此項困難而擱淺，政治協商會議原定於一月二十六日結束，但目下有種種徴象顯示或須展期至月底。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿五日電〕各代表雖對會議前途未示悲觀，且僉望續有發展，依今晚情形視之，政治協商會議似當不古於明日結束。政府組織，軍隊數量暨國民大會等問題，均未解決，但各分組委員會皆有若干進展之報告。蔣主席宴請周恩來席次會談之結果，已接近協議階段。衆信此當係憲政問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿五日電〕政治協商會議國共雙方主要代表今日開會，以謀將各項主要事件解除一部份困難，同時大會各小組委員會正繼續工作中。政府發言人稱：雙方雖未成立普遍協定，但若謂停頓亦不確當。國民黨或共產黨，絕未採取執抝態度，大局仍富於流動性。</p>
<h3>赤峯蘇軍已撤退　當地治安由團隊負責維持　調處執行部廣州組飛抵粵</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕執行部調處工作有顯著進展，派往豫北羅山小組，已使政府及共黨雙方將領同意，立即下令停戰，派往大同小組報告，該城周圍七十英里地區已無銜突，徐州附近鐵路錢仍有衝突，但美方代表何禮士電告，衝突已減少，集寗方面協商進行中，派往赤峯小組已與雙方取得聯絡，赤峯蘇軍官廿三日撤退，執行小組已請當地保安隊負責維持治安。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平二十四日電〕今夜調處執行總部之公報，顯示蘇方於撤離赤峯時（規定爲昨日），係將此熱河交通重鎭交與共產軍，而非交與國軍，公報稱：「赤峯之蘇聯警備軍，規定於昨日撤退，監導團已請當地之保安軍負責維持秩序」據曾遭蘇軍拘留七日，而於星期一獲釋美飛行員四人稱：赤峯區並無國軍，但有少數共產軍。據報紙上最近之消息，熱河省內之國軍，離赤峯至少有二三十里，此所以此間大多數觀察家認爲今日公報中所提出之「當地保安軍」係指共產軍言。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕調處部中融洽之空氣，使人感覺和平之果埀手可得，而調處部以外之空氣，則適與此相反，認有尙有重重暗影投射和平之路。最悲觀之政界人士向記者指陳，自停止衝突命令頒布後，共方通過調處執行部獲知國軍兵力配備，恒集中三倍以上之兵力，向國軍單薄之處進撲，國軍因此而失陷之地方已達十六城。據云：營口之役，共軍且出動坦克車二十四輛，該地國軍僅有一營，致被攻陷。冀南之永年刻仍被圍，幸該城四面環水，尙未被攻陷。集寗砲聲之息，主要由於國軍之撤出，最近共軍調動頻繁，向鐵路綫集中，且有向平津推進模樣，凡此種種，皆令人懷疑政治協商會議前途及停戰命令是否有效。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二十五日電〕國共下令停戰後第十一日，雙方仍互相責難對方違令。共軍例舉本月十五日國軍佔據香港附近之沙渡角，並於二十一日佔據晋南孟城，共軍則將停戰令生效後失去之晉北兩處城市克復，國軍指責共軍違令事實如下：（一）共軍攻擊隴海路東端海州，（二）共軍繼續攻擊山東鹽州，（三）共軍切斷信陽電報交通。軍事委員會發言人稱，國軍抄獲共軍當局對河南部隊命令，着所部掠奪一切糧食，徴　每一壯丁。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿五日電〕軍事調處執行部廣州調查組一行六人，廿五日由滬飛粵，下午一時二十分抵達天河機塲，該組美軍代表爲米勒上校，翻譯馮汝楫，政府代表黃維勤少校，凌志民上尉，共黨代表方旭少校，陳華秘書，定廿六日晨拜會張主任發奎，即展開調查工作。</p>
<h3>各部會還都　四月初完竣</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿五日電〕據可靠方面悉，政府各部會還都，大約在三月底四月初，始能全部完竣。國民參政會，仍可在重慶舉行一次大會。</p>
<h3>蔣夫人由長返平　歸途曾在錦州慰問傷兵</h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿五日電〕蔣夫人今日傍晚自長春乘機飛返此間。渠於歸途中曾在錦州作三小時勾留，當時曾向中國官吏致辭，並往訪兩陸軍醫院，慰問中國傷兵。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿五日電〕蔣夫人今晨八時乘美齡號機離此，蔣經國·董彥平隨行，過錦州時將小停勞軍，並晤熊主任，杜長官，然後轉平返渝。夫人行前囑記者轉向東北同胞表示惜別之意，並轉告關內民衆，渠已究成慰勞蘇軍及慰問東北同胞之使命。渠此行甚感愉快，然以時間關係，未能前往其他各地爲憾。蔣夫人離此時，中蘇在長高級官員及各界代表，均到機塲歡送。</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿四日電〕蔣夫人來長之第三天，上午十時參觀蘇軍司令部，在一點又十分鐘之過程中，司令部各部門均可參觀，而對士兵發問尤多，一來自烏克蘭之上等兵，對夫人問詢，曾作簡潔與持禮極恭之答覆，在司令部之宴會席上，三五白衣來往穿梭案頭，正午出席市民大會，發表感人至深之演說，並將對東北受苦受難之同胞予以有效救濟，募集振款，當於返渝後即着手發動，對此行不能去其他各地慰問，至表歉意，望出席者能將此意告諸遠地同胞。下午曾出席長春各界代表示，對婦女界表示，將召開全國締女代表會議，並訪問孤兒院，夜間將觀蘇軍演出之戲劇。</p>
<h3>蘇軍當局　深刻友情</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春廿四日電〕蘇軍當局今晚設宴歡迎蔣夫人，蘇軍高級將領對蔣主席夫婦所表現之溫暖友情，實以此次最深，此於蘇軍參謀長特洛曾科中將之演詞及敬酒致詞時，均見流露。</p>
<p>特洛曾科致詞</p>
<p>特洛曾科中將强調中蘇傳統友誼，並稱此次因兩國並肩與共同敵人作戰，以及中蘇友好條約之簽訂，益趨堅强，渠信兩國之文化及經濟合作，乃持久友誼之基礎。蔣夫人此行，足示中蘇友好無間。特洛曾科中將繼祝中華民國萬歲無疆，並舉杯爲蔣主席祝壽。渠稱，吾人今舉杯祝蔣主席　康，渠　偉大軍事領袖及偉大之政治家，蔣主席盡其畢生精力，盡瘁國事，始終堅持，抵抗日本侵略。另有蘇軍高級軍官六人，亦相繼舉杯祝賀，祝詞亦與特洛曾科中將之祝詞同樣懇切。</p>
<p>蔣夫人致謝詞</p>
<p>蔣夫人旋即席致答時，歡聲四起。夫人首對蘇方招待表謝意，繼稱，余今願稱諸君乃中國之友人，亦爲余之友人。席間與特洛曾科中將之談話稱，今晚盛會所予余之愉快，實甚於任何言詞。史達林委員長領導之蘇政府，乃民治之政府。夫人繼提出蘇聯人民是否對中國友好一點，自答稱，蘇聯曾於中國開始對日武裝抵抗之艱苦時際，予我協助，不僅助我以飛機，且助我以飛行人員，蘇聯人民乃中國之熱誠友人，此點余知之最詳，蓋是時余係任航空委員會秘書長職務。繼稱中國人民對蘇聯對中國之援助，永誌不忘。渠述及蘇聯最近助我收復東北諸省，所予之協助稱，蘇戰土於中國東北境內所灑之鮮血，已增强中蘇友誼，此一友誼，將保持久遠，蓋此係基於正直及正義，且兩國之合作亦係爲顧及兩國人民之利益，中蘇應維繫文化及經濟之合作。夫人旋舉杯祝史達林委員長健康，中蘇兩國人民密切合作，對戰爭和平均有貢獻之蘇聯婦女幸福日增，並對蘇軍之英勇，表示敬意。</p>
<p>盛大招待晚會</p>
<p>詞畢，放映最近蘇軍抗日之彩色影片。此於夫人臨行前夕舉行之盛大招待晚會，乃告結束。蔣夫人抵些三日，定廿五日晨返渝</p>
<h3>渝中大學生　向國府請願　促政治協商成功　對英法表示抗議</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿五日電〕中央大學·重慶大學·中大附中·重慶鑛中·蜀都中學·國立藝專及四川敎育學院八校學生六千餘人，爲促進政治協商會議成功，英築九龍屏山機塲，與法船白爾丁號事件，向英法表示抗議，今至國府請願，十時到達國府門外廣塲，首由國府派人出塲整理秩序，旋由政治協商會議會員孫科·周恩來·陳啓天·張君勱·邵力子·莫德惠等相繼對學生談話，直至十二時三十分，全體餐後入塲遊行，沿途散發傳單，呼口號，唱歌之聲嚮徹雲霄，行列所經之處，羣衆羣集道旁觀望·各校聯名散發之傳單，載有促進政治協商會議成功，遊行宜言及爲屏山機塲白爾丁事件，抗議英法告全國同胞書。（甲）向政治協商會議要求：（一）國家利益高於一切，放棄黨派私見。（二）軍隊國家化。（三）嚴格執行停戰命令以，永遠停止內戰。（四）然派一律退出學校。（乙）向英國政府要求（一）根據大西洋憲章，應交還香港九龍。（二）立即停止修築屏山機場。（三）賠償中國人民因此所受一切損失及損害。（丙）向法國政府要求（一）撤換上海總領事，（二）戰犯立即送還我國審判，（三）向中國政府鄭重道歉。</p>

<h3>交訓設各區　電信管理局</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明廿四日電〕抗戰勝利後，交部電信總局曾在各恢復區派設電信接收委員，茲悉其任務大致業已完成，近聞交部電訊總局已通令各地委員，限於月底辦理結束，將其工作移交新近設置之各區電信管理局，以資事權統一，滇黔區電信管理局將於下月初正式成立，新任局長陳樹人，已在由筑來昆途中，前任局長蕭接勛，聞將調赴華北工作。</p>

<p>皖主席李品仙將專理省政，其原兼各軍職，聞軍委會已命夏威繼任。</p>
<h3>我空軍訓練工作　今後將完全自行負責辦理　陳納德將軍月底離昆來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明廿四日電〕駕了重遊舊地而來昆明的陳納德將軍，月底離昆赴滬。據談，我國訓練空軍機構，可設於昆明，但因地勢太高，對於初級飛行員不大習慣，若在北平·漢口·廣州·杭州等地訓練初級飛行員比在昆明較爲適合。聞政府方面，因杭州爲我國訓練空軍之發祥地，其地氣候地勢，均適於此項工作，故有將航空學校遷返杭州之意。但陳氏認爲該地接近海岸，不宜於建立訓練中心，否則易受外來的威脅。我國戰時空軍訓練，初由昆蓉兩地航校担任，入伍訓練後，對初級與高級飛行訓練，多由我國在印創辦之航校担任，在印受訓成績合格者，可派至美國受高級訓練。近在印受訓之學員百餘人，現在奉令駕機自印飛返杭州等地，原設昆明之航空學校，早已奉令停止訓練工作，此後空軍之各級訓練，全由我方自行負責。</p>
<h3>軍部派員接管　各地美軍物資</h3>

<h3>中航機昆滬練綫　改售單程客票</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明二十四日電〕中央航空公司赴滬雙程客票近已奉令停止，一律發售單程客票，由昆赴滬票價爲十萬八千五百元，由渝赴滬栗價爲十萬另二百元，該公司班機日程爲星期一四渝漢班機，星期二五渝漢京滬班機，星期三六昆渝漢滬班機，現由昆赴漢滬乘客登記者極多。</p>

<h3>收復區各煤礦　加緊計劃整理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕翁副院長抵京後，正加緊計劃整理收復區各煤礦，並督促修復津浦。平漢各路。翁氏對於目前重振收復區工業之信念甚爲堅定，對橫梗復工問題前面兩大難題，如原料。動力之困難，認爲並非無法解除，祗須煤源暢通，交通恢復，即可次第復工。翁氏對消弭目前工潮之看法，確認工人生活須待調整，但當生產不繼之際，率然罷工，工人本身損害甚大，蓋以工潮可能刺激物價，而彼等所能爭得之工資，與物價上漲之抵消，大有可能也。</p>
<h3>張果為談　華北區金融</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕華北區財政特派員張果爲語記者：（一）平津金價暴漲，頗受東北金價影響，傳滿幣與法幣比率，爲十三比一，該處金價每兩約滿幣一五〇〇〇至二〇〇〇〇約合法幣廿萬左右，故黃金遂多流往東北，刻政府正研究應付辦法。（二）衝突全部停止，交通切實恢復，則華北物價，必可下落，因農村之糧食棉花，與海運之百貨，即可源源而來。（三）華北稅收已先自冀魯二省開始，現每月收入的十數億，以之作政費，開支相差不多，如衝突停止，稅收全部恢復，再輔以整理敵偽產業收入，華北財政，可無問題。（四）平津收兌偽聯鈔，情况良好，過去兩週中，北平一地約已兌百餘億，小額法幣不如外間想像之缺乏，因此等小額法幣在後方流通已少，銀行積存甚多，儘可大批運來收兌僞聯鈔。（五）偽蒙疆銀行總行在張家口，情况不詳，將來情况許可，擬親往調查，處理蒙疆票辦法，刻尙無法擬定。</p>
<h3>三木陰謀活動　已在錦州捕獲</h3>

<h3>徐州緩靖區縮軍　方面軍集團軍總部裁撤　湯恩伯馮治安等分任軍區懷令</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿五日電〕劃歸徐州綏靖區指揮之各部隊編成工作，已大致就緒，原屬戰區司令長官部之方面軍及各集團軍總司令部，將於本年底以前一律裁撤。但爲便利指揮整軍裁編兵員及綏靖地方計，徐州區直隸部隊將縮編爲四個綏靖軍由湯恩伯·王耀五·馮治安·劉汝明分任軍區司令，聞徐州區縮軍結果，實際已裁兵五個師。又軍委會以馮治安於停止衝突後餒遵命令，於艱危環境下力持鎭靜，捍衛地方，完成防護國家命脈所繫之賈汪煤礦，曾呈請國府明令嘉獎。軍委會對馮部因防護該礦而受傷之官兵，已予獎勵。</p>

<h3>伊朗問題經激辯後　列入星期一議程　蘇代表函安全普說明反對理由　貝爾納斯已于前日離倫敦返美</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播稱，聯合國機構安全理事會，昨日下午決定將伊朗、印度尼西亞及希臘問題，列入下星期一會議之議程中，當時蘇聯外次雜辛斯基與英外相貝文曾發生於猛烈之辯論。先是貝文起立，作激昻之致詞，據稱，無論大國或小國，如有申訴，當應提出，蘇聯指英國威脅世界和平，在秘密會中已屢次聽到，甚覺厭倦，爰特於今日公開會議中提出。貝文並謂，安全理事會應准許伊朗代表到會陳述，但對於印度尼西亞問題，貝文則調此事應由荷印本身處理云。蘇代表維辛斯基聽取貝文之言後，立即起立，據稱，大會雖已將伊朗問題列入議程，但蘇聯仍不放棄其一貫之立塲，換言之，即蘇聯認爲伊朗糾紛問題，絕非安全理事曾懼力所能過問之事。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播稱，出席聯合國大會之蘇聯首席代表副外委長維辛斯，今致函安全理事會，對伊朗提出申訴一節，表示遺憾。維氏並表示對理事會考慮此項申訴。據稱，亞塞耳貝然要求自治，此僅係該國與伊朗兩者間之事，應由兩國直接談判。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十四日電〕聯合國大會全體一致決定在安全理事會下，設立原子委員會，表決後數小時，美國務卿貝爾納斯即忽忽乘坐杜魯門總統專機遄返華盛頓，貝爾納斯臨行稱，美國贊成安全理事會立即公開討論伊朗、希臘及東印度問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕伊朗駐美大使霍辛今日廣播稱：伊朗政府向安全理事會控訴蘇聯，現無意撤回控訴。安全理事會對于此事若無行動，則該會不得生存即已死亡。安全埋事會倘縱容積暴或侵略，則將種下第三次世界大戰禍根。</p>
<h3>軍事參謀會　二月一日前召集</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦廿十五日廣播稱：今日安全理事會召開公開會議時，美首席代表提議，在二月一日前召開聯合國軍事參謀會議，當被通過，因而奠定世界組織軍事力量之基礎。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕聯合國機構安全理事會今日公開會議時，議程中列有一項，係以軍力付予安全理事會執行和平，其步驟爲成立軍事參謀委負會，以實施聯合國憲章中所規定之一款，即由安全理事會早日決定辦法，設立聯合國機構之特殊軍隊，保障和平是。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二十五日電〕聯合國安全理事會對該會得調遣各會員國所給予之「利牙」即軍隊，以保持世界和平之計劃，今日將採取其第一步驟。安全理事會十一理事國，同時須決定如何與何時檢討英蘇兩國所陳控之伊希東印糾紛問題。該理事會預定於今日午後舉行之會議，可望採取前所建議之指令，立即成立「五强」參謀總長或其代表所聯合組成之軍事參謀委員會。有關國際軍隊之量·質·及安全理事會可資調遣之便利程度之「特別協定」起草工作，將由各該軍事領袖担任之。但該理事會之主要工作，將為決定如何處理伊朗等地之「現局」糾紛問題。為預防臨時變卦計，安全理事會在企圖裁決該項問題之價値，與將否對此有所行動之前，可望於下星期內先行初步之报告聽取。英方官員屢稱，外長貝文極盼有「最早之時機」以「閘明並辯正」英國對希臘東印兩地之政策。安全理事會中可能復有第四政治糾紛提出之跡象，據獲自黎巴嫩之消息，該國政府正訓令出席聯合同大會之代表，將盟軍仍留駐於里文達之問題，訴諸安全理事會。同時在國際上，希臘問題可因英希公佈簽訂財政經濟協定（美國亦參與其間）而越見複雜。若干觀察家相信，此事將使批判英國對希政策者更多指摘之機會。彼等可藉此指斥謂英國正企圖統治希臘之經濟，因英希經濟協定與希臘此後之選舉有密切聯緊故也。</p>
<h3>關於朝鮮問題　三強會議經過</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十五日電〕莫斯科今日廣播稱：朝鮮美軍佔領區內，一部份報紙曾刋載消息，暗示蘇聯欲在朝鮮樹立託管制度，此項報道完全不確。當局已授權塔斯通訊社予以否認，並將事實發表。據稱，美國於莫斯科三外長會議時，曾提議朝鮮在過淚時期，可由中英美蘇四國共管，但旋將此議撤消，贊成蘇提議。蘇聯主張立即在朝鮮成立臨時民主政府，由中英美蘇四國共同監督但以五年爲限。依照美國計劃，朝鮮將由四國共管十年。</p>
<h3>蘇聯決定參加審訊日戰犯</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京二十五日電〕今日自權威方面獲悉：蘇聯將派代表參加國際法庭，從事審判東條英磯以及其他戰爭嫌疑犯。蘇聯將派一檢察官協助首席檢察官季南，惟名單尙未發表。預料審問將於二月底之前，在日陸軍省中舉行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕英國法官卡爾·亨天萊及台維斯等三八，日昨來此，與美國官方一度會議後，今晚啓程前往東京，參加審訊日戰犯。</p>
<h3>美機匠修理星座運輸機之引擎</h3>
<p>該機置有機頭蓋，略類似汽車之車頭蓋，可隨時揭開，俾機匠獲有直接檢視引擎之機會，金屬隔板分隔二千五百四馬力之引擎四具，二分鐘內即可開閉，較以前所有者誠屬進步不少。</p>
<h3>地球與月球　已取得接觸　以雷達為媒介物</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕陸軍部今日宣布：陸軍　號隊科學家，曾在實騐中用「雷達」與月球接觸，此事不論在平時或戰時應用，均將大有價値。此項試騐係在新求　州倍爾　之伊文斯實騐室內舉行。第一次與月球接觸，係在本月十日，此後曾有數次成功。試騐時應用特殊設備，將極高週率能之波動，以光行速度發射至空間，約於半秒鐘後察得其回聲。按月球距離地球約二萬八千八百五十七哩。此項實騐之一種應用法，或可以雷篷控制遠程噴射推進　火箭推進之發射物，於同溫層上環繞地球云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社美國洛杉磯廿五日電〕美國陸軍部宣布用「雷達」週波與月球接觸後，澳洲退役軍官奧斯巴納少校今日談稱：澳洲科學界早於一九四一年以「雷達」與月球接觸。澳洲各科學家在雪梨大學雷達物理實騐室中，以高能力雷達設備，向月球放射，立即察出其波動，每隔二·四秒鐘間歇一次。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕皇家海軍破冰船波　克斯號，昨在邊　中在泰晤士河口盲目航行，作曾達超短波儀器之秘密伐騐，河口船舶雖擠，竟未遭遇磕撞，預料在一二年內，英國全部商船均可裝置雷達設備，俾在任何氣餱之下均得航行。試騐時由船主在密閉下健之　室中，藉雷達銀慕之指示，以傳話器向窗外三十呎處之舵手傳令，銀幕之上顯示兩哩內之浮橋，及河內往來及停泊之船箋。根據此項指示，即令舵手使舵，結果竟未出事，該項試騐後未及數小時，即聞有英商船一艘與美油船一艘，因視錢不明而在海峽內之古特文附近互撞，俱受重創。</p>

<h3>日官僚政治傳統打破　內務省澈底改組　地方長官撤換幾近半數</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿五日專電〕日政府於通過內閣關於改組內務省之決議後，遂將四十七名之地方長官中免職二十八名。又另任命新地方長言二十八名。以前日本地方長官僉由各官担任，彼等在木戶幸一領導之下，組成官僚政治集團，此次之大改組已將例由官僚集團壓制日人民之傳統打破</p>

<h3>來帥尊重女權　解放日本娼妓</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕日人每將所生女兒鬻入妓院，此係數百年來舊習，今日已由麥帥命令禁止，麥帥令日政府遵守波茨坦宣言中保證「尊重人民基本權利」一節，因此必須取消關於公娼之各種法律及束縛婦女之一切賣身契。妓院領照最近業已禁止，惟准許出賣女兒之法律尙存。兩星期前東京妓院業公會曾議決解放妓女，取消賣身契，許其獨立營業。</p>

<h3>難兄難弟　一個想上天　一個想下海</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿四日電〕美國米納蘇太大學航空工程敎授奇思畢卡特博士，擬乘汽球上升二十哩入同溫層，較人類所嘗到之處更高五哩。其弟奧古期德畢卡特，現在瑞士故鄕研究，則擬深入海底一萬三千呎。二人係欒生兄弟，過去皆以研究汽球上升著名，今則分居東西兩半球，而一思上天，一謀入海，司謂難兄難弟。奧古斯德之潛水器械，係在勃魯塞爾大學作成模型，爲一密封之小室，重十噸，用銅版襲造，其窗口玻璃厚一八·四吋，以抵抗水底互大之壓力·奇思畢卡特則擬偕其妻同乘汽球上升，所用汽球爲以前同溫層探險中從未用過者，擬藉此擴充人類對於空氣上層之學識，尤特別注意於宇宙綫，經此研究可加連原子學識之發展。</p>
<h3>託管會會議席上　顧維鈞演辭　託管制度之終極目標　在使被治者獨立自治</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕世界一切人民自治乃持久和平的條件之一，此點係美代表杜爾斯與中國駐英大使顧維鈞，昨夜在威士敏斯德中央大堂聯合國大會之託管委員會會議中提出者。杜爾斯提出修正案，得顧維鈞附議，主張延至大會在美國舉行會議之下半期時，始成立託管理事會，屆時可與受委統治各强國商妥將委任統治地交於託管制之下。委員會延至今日續開，屆時將賡續討論美國之修正案，並由荷蘭與伊拉克代表發言。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿四日專電〕我國代表顧維鈞於託管小組委會會議中致詞稱：託管制度將爲數百萬計之非自治人民帶來希望，渠對若千聯合國會員國之聲明，表示欣慰。尤以對英國及紐西蘭決以其代管地，交置託管制下之舉爲然。渠稱，此種聲明極爲感人，且說明各國熟誠盼望於極早可能期內，建立託管理事會。然其他若千國家就此同一問題發表之聲明，已引起吾人之懷疑及不安。顧氏繼稱，第一次世界大戰後。史末資將軍建議以委治地代替領土兼併，此一觀點極獲好評，今日該一觀點，已於聯合國憲章之託管制度益趨圓滿。附屬領土之所有權，應屬於被治之人民。在委任統治地方面，由行政當局代表國聯行動，終有一日附屬土地之人民將趨成熟，於國際社會中，將不復爲認係低級而被視爲平等之一員。數以百萬計之人民，將視聯合國組織爲「維護其福利之可靠保衛者」，聯合國憲章中明文規定，附屬土地人民之獨立，應爲託管制之終極目標。託管制之規則，應盡可能明晰廣闊大度。憲章中第十一章規定代管者之義務及責任，此乃「新和平巨塔之柱石」代表「目光遠大極具政治家風度之政策」。中國對此憲章極爲重視。憲章中所載之義務，乃勇往邁進之一大步驟，本此義務各國應以治理代管領土，不以本身利益置於被治人民之上，爲其神聖義務。在中國人心目中，憲章第十一章乃照耀數百萬自治人民自治之路之火炬，至被治人民達於成熟可以自治，並加入國際社會時，促成世間不安及焦灼之一原因即將消除，世界將因此而進入安靜諧和之坦途。</p>
<h3>救濟總署四十八國家　明年初在滬開會　本年度內將在美歐開大會兩次　總署購駁船運物資來中國內河</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕聯合國善後救濟總署最高行政人員今日發表：參加總署之四十八國將於明年初在上海開會，總署現正指導籌備此項大會事宜，惟本年內亦將有兩個大會舉行，上海會議將爲善後救濟總署之結束會議。本年內之兩次國際會議，第一次於數星期內即將舉行，地點大約在美國新求賽州之大西洋市，第二次約於秋間在歐洲舉行。據可靠方面發表，總署擬在一年後辦理結束。中國方面希望總署最高指導當局於結束前來至遠東。總署行政人員則表示中國與菲律濱謀得超過分配額以上之擴大救濟，恐未必能如願以償，因總署並無額外經費，亦不能减少他處之救濟工作。中國所得救濟，自總署預算案成立以來，己可首屈一指，總計六億七千五百萬美元，菲律濱方面共爲三百萬美元。現在已經規定之援華物資，當可證明爲中國在一年內所能吸收之最高數　云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電」聯合國善後救濟總署爲推進遠東救濟計劃，定日內派遣特別代表團，前往菲律濱及中國，購置嚴船十萬噸，以便運輸救濟品，前往中國內河。代表團共三人，由史璜生任團長，將先往馬尼拉，以便在該處獲得陸海軍剩餘船　，該署將以數百萬元購置各種船艇，一俟購得後，將立即運往中國</p>

<h3>美陸軍航空司令　由史巴茲繼任</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十四日電〕杜魯門總統今日宣布：陸軍航空部隊司令安諾總辭職照准，其遣缺已任命史巴茲承乏。史巴茲將軍曾率美空軍在歐洲及北非作戰有功，旋在太又平洋方面在戰略轟炸隊司令，向廣島投擬第一枚原子彈之B29型機係屬其指揮</p>

<h3>本報駐美特約記者視野中的美英法一般生活　海外僑胞在「中國世界」現形　朱家讓寄自紐約</h3>
<p>說起在美的我們中國同胞，那就太多了·「中國街」原就是中國的世界，中國字，中國話，以及中國報很普遍，據說在舊金山的「中國街」內，且可以中文寄信，中文通話，但這多限於粵籍老華僑的範圍。若夫我們的達官富紳，名流學者，我今姑以「高等華人」名之，亦是沿路撞到，隨時見面，尤其在聖誕或新年，很多來紐約玩，於是馬路上，館子裏，男女雜沓，笑語風生，聽聽口音，都是「咱們貴同胞」，但當面例不招呼，絕不有「異鄉逢知已」情事。這與巴黎倫敦不同，原因當在人多了便不覺得希奇之故。</p>
<h3>海外逍遙　愧對了博士頭銜</h3>
<p>據這幾天接觸所得，在此的「高等華人」大抵生活都是不差的，很多人携妻帶眷，住着舒適的公寓，過着安閒的日子，當然，他們終有些淵源，才能來逍遙，但奇怪的，很多人的心胸，依然好似鬱積萬分，牢騷滿腹，或駡中央不行，或怨懷才不遇，有幾人掛了博士頭銜，對國內人便都視同蠢貨，傲慢勢利，不圖還在海外貽羞！</p>
<h3>人心望治　華僑日報最風行</h3>
<p>祖國的消息似乎比在英法更靈通了。</p>
<p>第一，美報記者不少在華，中國電訊自較充實。</p>
<p>再則，華文報亦有四家，他們雖不能得　當的國內專電，有時也儘有望通訊可看，其中美洲日報最較完備，但銷數還不及華僑日報。據說華僑日報能迎合多數「望治」的「人心」。</p>
<h3>美國生產　尙未臻平時狀態</h3>
<p>這裏的物價，比戰前目也漲起不少了，所好食糖而外一切都可自由買到。全國物價管制局（OPA)　，對各項物價俱有限制，惟黑市仍然難免，有錢總有辦法。照目前生活情形，百數十元可以租得五六個房問的公庽，假如天天上館子，單人的伙食費每月也得七八十元。一切日用品有的便宜，有的意外昻貴。平時生產究竟未全恢復，國內朋友所最歡迎的手表及自來水筆，還是稀少，手表都是新牌子，買時另繳奢侈稅，派克五十一號，竟沒有看到過。</p>
<p>還有幾點觀感，附帶記述在下面：</p>
<h3>法國雖弱　但優點不能抹煞</h3>
<p>論美·英·法·三個國家，自然是美國最富强，法國現在最弱。但是法國這民族，也決不能因其戰敗而可抹煞其優點，反之，法國人在藝術科學上的成就，以及從生活方法上去觀察，其文化程度之高，決不遜於英美。巴黎的市政是很够現代標準的，一切設施應有盡有，戰前法國與瑞士都以吸引歐美遊各賺錢出名，可惜自經兵奬，創鉅痛深，弄得衣食不週，生活高漲，人民不好過日子，現在所處地位最壞。</p>
<h3>驚濤駭浪　英始終屹立不動</h3>
<p>英國比法國情形好，原因固然受禍程度不同，實在政治能力頂强，拿得出辦法，而且能貫澈。最懀炙人口的物質管制，眞能做到合理與公平，以此苦樂與共，秩序也就安定。人民議員與輿論，儘管天天對政府吵，政府每一件事都得公諸議會，晝夜爭辯，然而國有常軌，事不紊棼。一個國家，一個組織，凝結力特別强大，因此雖經驚濤駭浪，而終能屹立不搖，英國之所以不敗，誰都承認不是靠別的，就在道一點點。這股精神救了英國！再說美國吧，是的，這塲大戰是他打贏的；然而美國人比起英國人來，適如一個聰明能幹而又落托不覊的富家子弟，面對老大拘謹道貌岸然的紳士。</p>
<h3>歐美三城　熱情·正經·活潑</h3>
<p>巴黎倫敦紐約三大城市，都人如潮湧，而氣象各異。法國人到處兒女情長，男女隨地相擁而吻。英國人決不肯這樣幹，看上去都是規矩公民，不苟言笑。美國呢，太天眞活潑了，比較英國人似乎有生氣，然缺點也就不免，秩序方面似乎要略遜一籌，這樣有名的紐約城，竟沒有像倫敦乾凈，舊報紙，香烟頭，以及氷洪淋紙厘，往往拋擲滿街，有不少人，痰亦亂吐。最糟的還有地道車站，比起倫敦相差太多，毛房臭氣薰犬，委實太笑話；不過這些地方，當然不是每處皆然耳。</p>
<p>勝利到來，今日各國的內政，都以民生爲中心，然復員重建，尙難一蹴而就，故人民生活亦須沿着曲綫進展。譬如像英國，現行統制，尙要繼續五年，法國　境更差，老百姓的袴帶還得繼續收緊，因爲提高生活標準，一方固應充分供應，一方也要增强富力，戰時的虧損要先求補償。輸出貿易不能稍緩，自已的消耗只得節省。等於一個人，必先重振基業，始得放寬享用，否則單馮錢一到手，即便吃喝，究非正道。這樣看來，除了美國之外，一般生活暫時還得緊縮，水準尙未易馬上提高。所好歐洲人似乎都很懂得，他們的收入平均都低，無從增强購買力，故亦即將就，這是很應爲我們中國人特別驚醒的，我們更有什麼資格在目前講享受？然人民熬熬肚子子，政府亦自有其職責，以保護人民，培養人民，在這裏，一個全體的社會安全制度，乃成爲必要，使每一人民失業有保險，疾病有保險，從呱呱墮地到六年將盡，皆有國家和社會的看顧，不致有一個人再在自生自滅的境遇下生活。這是歐美各國今日最孜孜是急的第一大事。我們的老百姓，也得有一天被大家當心才好。</p>
<h3>機械發達　一切都講究自動</h3>
<p>由於他們的機器文明，一切都講自動，打電話，買郵票，往往都無人管，只要錢進去，東西出來，有些地方，踏上階沿，門就開啓，輕輕一確，水火齊嘖，簡直有些天羅地網。然機器雖甚發達，人力依然缺乏。看歐美今日的情形，女人都從廚房裏出來了：打字，秘書，賣票員，售貨員，出納，會計，以至侍役工人，到處女人當道，工作皆相當辛勞，待遇則十分平常。然據一般觀察，服務成績都很不差，因爲她們的體格好，做事亦認眞。</p>
<h3>女人當道　轉移了社會風氣</h3>
<p>不過，這樣一來，她們有了家庭，就更勞苦了。普通找傭人，是太幻想的事，一則大家可找正式職業作，何必爲人傭僕；再則，工資貴，平常人那雇得起。於是家務只能自己動手，這些女子內外全才，的確有本領；而大家全不游手好閒。社會風氣亦因之容易振作，沒有人敢偷懶取巧，或憑藉人事關係，混日子。一空下來，她們需要男性安慰，最自然的途徑，莫如跟丈夫或男朋友尋娛樂，就不會再找閒人打沙蟹，閙差池了。歐美社會女性很被尊重。中國社會隱隱中，亦常以女人爲中心。社會風氣，關繫政風學風，其振靡起敝，恒取決於女子，故女同胞的關係實在很大</p>
<h3>水雷之搜尋者</h3>
<p>美國海員三人，立於受傷美艦之舵輪室內，希能尋獲日本附近海上之壓力型水雷。此等下水雷，係美機於口人無條件投降前擲下者，不易爲普通掃海艦所掃除，歷相當時日後，即可自動失效，但若不實際接觸，仍無從證明其已失效用。尋覓水雷之受傷美艦，計有三艘，每艘載海員二十二人，引擎室設於甲板上，如此則海員於肇禍時，不致自閉於下層室中窒息而死。引擎上下，均置有厚墊，可略减輕接觸時之震撼。</p>
<h3>事在人為　同胞們迎頭苦幹</h3>
<p>「事在人爲」，這句老話，歷一久不磨。所調「知己知彼」，究是必要的。歐美人與中國人有什麼不同？我們有的缺點，他們也有，上面已多說起。我國目前政治經濟地位，縱然困難，非我獨有，人民的道德水準，不免稍降，亦是事實使然，人家又豈例外。今日巴黎倫敦的娼妓滿街，英美報載刧案迭出，都是明證。所貴者，惟民族自己有志氣，能及時振奮，能自强不息，一切就有了辦法，我們也無庸自饅！再說，他們今日建設偉大，政治文化昌明，也是日積月累，我們有的是人，爲什麼不能迎頭趕上，與他們並駕齊驅呢？人家能幹，我們不能幹，是決無此理的，本此信念，這未來二十年中國的前途，是一定光明的。然而，我們在這裏也不能不擔心：假如單從形式上着眼，而忽略精神基礎，結果亦將落空的。我們的政治幾時才能修明有力？尤重要的，我們的全國上下，幾時才能掉去打小算盤，鑽牛角尖，僅知私圖罔顧大局的心理呢？這是今後大中羅國運休戚禍福關鍵中的關鍵！（一月五日）</p>
<h3>大足佛像探奇　成熟期石刻古蹟一臠　本報航訊　朱錦江講演</h3>
<p>右稿爲朱敎授應四川大足地方人士之邀，與顧頡剛·馬衡諸先生前往考察，歸來應復旦大學文學院學術講演會之請，作兩小時講演，此記其要點什一而已。（張劍卿申雲龍合記）聞所著專書，中國造像史與大足石刻，不久可以問世云。（編者按：大足位於重慶西北約一百華里）</p>
<p>佛像傳人中國</p>
<p>研究石刻造像，須先知佛敎輸入我國之歷史，據釋老志漢明帝時夜夢金人，詢之諸臣，則皆以佛對，於是乃遣蔡情等去天竺取回佛像佛經。然考之史實，蓋不可能，蓋當時適値東西交通斷絕之時。中西交通實係於公元前一三八年，但西方尙無佛像，僅法輪及塔菩提樹無憂樹而已。至松溪大塔玉垣等，約起於公元一三〇年頃，亦無佛像。</p>
<p>印度佛像之創作，盛於建馱羅國時，大月氏迦感色加王篤信佛敎而當時希臘之神像雕刻，方傳至印度，於是佛像之雕刻，隨之開始，漢明帝永平十六年（公元七四）班超出使西域，東西交通暢通，張騫在西域時，曾見有卭竹·蜀布，皆爲自我國海運而往是具。當時海上早已交通，而佛像佛法，乃從南京傳入我國。晉和尙法顯於義熙九年（公元三九九）去印時値印度笈多王朝，正爲印度造像之盛期，渠返國時（公元四一三）帶回佛像於靑島回國，又有唐僧玄奘於貞觀三年（公元六二九），自天山北路往印度，此時印度之佛像，多遭破壞，然亦携經像。王玄策三次到印度，取回的經像更多。</p>
<p>中國造像鳥瞰</p>
<p>西晉時已有人造像，然今已無存，教煌石室，爲東晉廢帝太和元年（公元三六六），爲秦沙門樂燇所建，初國人不自知之，至公元一九〇三年，爲匈牙利人洛克齊所發見，渠返歐後盛稱之，遂有英人Stein之繼至，用種種方法取去該室之精萃，七十大箱返倫敦。公元一九〇七年，又有法人Pelliot，又來敦煌石室，拍攝照片千餘張。歸著敦煌圖錄。由是國人始知有敦煌石室。北宋孝武帝大明六年，和尙曇曜干山西大同雲岡所建之石窟，與公元五〇〇年北魏所建之（洛陽）龍門賓陽洞，太原天龍山等諸窟，自晚唐至北宋，實爲我國造像最盛之時期，玄宗時塑像家楊惠之，實爲我國造像史一大創造能手，亦爲作風之轉變關健所在。</p>
<p>我國造像初期，不外模仿，晚期乃開始創造就容貌而言，初仿印度人貌，以漸變爲我漢人之像，唐時之造像面多豐滿，及宋則較削瘦，是受當時代之影響。至於衣褶，則不似印度之透體薄衣，而爲反復旋律之衣紋。建馱羅式造像帽式，頗爲簡單，我國之造像，帽則式樣繁雜，細緻，有二十餘種之多。就體態而言，印度之造像多正坐，我國造像則多趺坐。</p>
<p>大足石刻，分北山與寳頂山兩區。</p>
<p>大足石刻現狀</p>
<p>（甲）北山，爲唐刺史韋君靖所建之永昌寨，造像年代，則自唐昭宗乾寧二年（公元八九五），以迄宋高宗紹興十六年（公元一一四六）。茲分述各窟於後：</p>
<p>（一）韋陀天前窟：窟之正面有北方天王韋陀天（亦稱多聞天）之像，天王乃佛門護法者，而韋君靖當時爲昌州刺史，於此地建永昌寨以護守地方，則此像實韋刺史。天王旁有二夜叉，左側有供養人，頭上有二雉翎，此則與「古圖騰」有關矣。右方有千手觀音，然細考之則毘紐天，而非觀音，以其二目猙獰，故常爲天王之像。此類造像，大同雲岡石窟亦有。</p>
<p>（二）後窟：有造像記，其年代有永平三年五年（公元九一五），乾寧三年（八九六），造像有觀音，地藏彌陀。</p>
<p>（三）觀音窟：像多模糊重修，左方有一像頭戴巾幗，服裝若貫婦人者。另一小窟中有一像服帶飄酒，至爲生動，實受當時繪畫之影響，有「吳帶當風」之趣味。</p>
<p>（四）如來窟：甚大，爲如來說法之像，旁有供養人，及觀音，普賢，文殊等像，前有法輪，惜已殘缺，璧右側，刻文殊詣維摩問疾圖，宋石恪繪。</p>
<p>英國活標幟：喬治六世　是否能安坐在王座上？</p>
<p>自從淸一色的工黨政府成立以後，英王的地位便在理論上顯得背謬矛盾，雖則在實際的運行上，他和新政府機構配合得十分適宜，似乎英國王位原是爲今天社會主義的政治實騐而設立的。工黨人士對王位並沒有絲毫千涉的意向。反之，正當歐陸帝王紛紛在左傾的暴風雨中沒落的時候，英國的制度都依舊屹立，像直布羅陀的岩石一樣。由各方面的情勢觀察，很容易使人相信，今王喬治六世是天造地設，來應付當前這個政治危機的。喬治六世是一個平民化的人物。假使現在在位的是今王的祖文愛德華七世，或是他的父親喬治五世，或是因爲和辛浦生夫人結婚而遜位的愛德華入世，那慶情形就完全改觀。這幾個舊王都是意志堅强的人，時時會在他們的內閣面前，　出王權的姿態，有時候選堅持要照他們的觀望做去。有一次，他在威爾斯視察煤礦，看到工人情况的惡劣，大爲震怒，（當然這是絕對的，）當塲就厲聲說，必定要想些辦法才好，他因此痛責他的政府，其實，這時政府正在計劃改良礦業。英王原位該由愛德華繼承，受了命運的播弄，才使喬治六世登王座的。說到皇后，她有豐富的常識和熱誠的忠心，對於他的丈夫是極大的帮助。她的內心實在無殊於一個蘇格蘭的主婦，但是她能以尊嚴和理解力　其公務。總之，英王，這大英聯合王國的活標幟，現在依舊安安穩穩坐在他的寳座上面。（二十四日，麥根齊，倫敦）</p>
<h3>光輝繼續發揚的革命聖地　黃埔海港巡視記</h3>
<p>— 本報廣州特派員　梁風</p>
<p>科學雖然已昌明到原子能時代，但假如我們不否認地球上祇有百分之三十是陸地，而百分之七十是海洋的話，那末，海軍在國防上自有它的重要性。我國海軍在過去委實貧乏得太可憐了，這次在復員中，當局也就特別着重建設新的海軍，因此「黃埔」，這具有良好軍港條件的地方，並沒有爲當局所忽略。在廣州光復後，當局首令珠江水利局草擬黃埔闢埠的計劃，以便加緊進行。去年十二月廿七日，美海軍軍事代表團，由梅雷芝海軍少將率同軍官七人，來粵視察黃埔港，爲了這個確有發展爲海軍根據地及深水港可能的黃埔，記者曾於前日實地參觀過一次。</p>
<p>二簇靑絲樹叢　黃埔在望</p>
<p>在一側和麗的淸晨，一艘小型的火輸，在金光閃爍下平靜地的珠江水面劃了一條破痕，向着黃埔進發。經過一點又一刻鐘的航程，黃埔從水平綫上一片靑綠的樹叢中湧現出來，記者帶着一顆熟烈的心，凝望着這與革命不可分離的地方，彷彿看見它正發着尊嚴與神聖的光芒，我們都不會忘記它對中國的貢獻。自從　總理手創黃埔軍校，它的光輝便留存到現在，從北伐以至抗戰勝利，這光輝便一直發揮下來了。</p>
<p>海面廣闊險要　羣艦雲集</p>
<p>黃埔海面廣闊，掌握珠江口岸，控制整個河道，形勢險要異常。泊在岸邊的有二百至三百噸的戰艦三艘，廿五噸砲艇十二艘，首先現入我們的眼傑。這是廣東區接收的敵體而後改名的。其中名「舞鳳號」的那一艘，是三艘中較大的一艘淺水砲艦，重三百噸，裝有兩門三吋口徑平射砲，速率不下七海里，現在仍可航行。另二艘爲「勝利號」與「復興號」係巡河艦，重量也達二百噸與王百八十噸，本來該兩艦都配有鋼砲，但接收時已拆卸下來，現正待修理完好，方可航行，「時速」大的六海里左右。</p>
<p>艦艇泊在埠頭　星羅棋佈</p>
<p>這些戰艦逐一參觀後，又走到另一個碼頭。那裏也有無數的艦艇，星羅棋佈的停泊着。八艘二十五噸重木製的普字砲艇四艘二十五噸重的鐵製的特字砲艇，這些特字砲艇的裝置有雙管機槍一挺及重機槍多挺，以外還有探照燈。速度每時達十二海里·這都是我海軍當局接收後整編過的，將來廣東有三隊巡邏艦隊，這一組艦隊是第三艦隊。據海軍特派員公署的黃汝康上校對記者談：「俟香港政府將敵艦移交我國後，我們即用來訓練海軍，現在我們已準備成立一海軍士兵訓練班，並聘請美國顧問及敎官多人來協助。…」</p>
<p>兩個船塢水閘　百年遺物</p>
<p>隨後再去參觀海軍造船廠，這個廠是張之洞時代的產物，建築了百多年的兩個船塢和水閘，到現在還沒有損壞。但因上下游二一十哩，河床淤積，必須澈底疏濬，方能容納巨舶。這個造船廠現衹修理而不能製造。廠裏有鍛工塲，鑄工塲和鋸木塲，均用機器發電，鑄工塲有八十多匹馬力的電機兩副，發電廠也有四十二匹馬力的發電機兩副，此外，還有潛水銅人。</p>
<p>日俘留廠工作　抽閒垂釣</p>
<p>現在該廠的主持人是吳趨時廠長，在廠裏做工有六十五名是日俘，他們的生活似乎都很舒適，記者離開造船廠時，見有幾個日俘閒情逸緻地坐在塢邊垂釣哩！</p>
<p>參觀後，循蕭原路，踏進小輪，仰望着　國父銅像，與　蔣主席親書的「東江陣亡烈士紀念場」長碑，巍然矗立江濱，雄峙如昔，數十年來，　國父與　蔣主席苦心經營的革命聖地，亦隨着抗戰勝利而重光，緬懷以前的偉績，我們今後應如何去發揚光大黃埔的光榮，如何去建設這個淵深寬闊的黃埔海港呵！（一月十四日）</p>

<h3>平賣方法應整頓</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我們上海小市民，飽受八年生活的壓迫。勝利了，大家想鬆一口氣，豈知氣還未曾鬆得，却來了更重的壓力。例如近來報上接連登載平賣的消息和告示，包括一切生活必需物資，有布疋，麵粉，糖，油，肉，魚，蛋……而且數量相當多，小市民們以爲可以鬆一口氣了。但事實決不如「消息」的美滿。在參加幾次「長蛇陣」失敗回來，讀了各報記載關於平賣的種種，綜合起來，條述如次：</p>
<p>（一）出售時問不準，而辦事人復故意「慢吞吞」。</p>
<p>（二）售品限量不符，食油規定每戶三斤，而僅有每戶限購半斤者</p>
<p>（三）出售數量，遠不如「告示」之多，顯係經手商店暗吞。</p>
<p>（四）秩序混亂，黃牛黨充斥。</p>
<p>（五）某些人可以公然購買，不必排隊，而數量反多。</p>
<p>總之，這樣賣下去，小市民決不會得到實惠，應請當局鄭重考慮，設法改善。如果當局有意經常舉辦，大可利用新建之保甲組織，參照定量分配制度，加以改良，使入軌道，而不致像現在的混亂，無秩序，無組織，無計劃。假如當局僅為應付目前需要的話，也應加強監督，使經手商店不能「鯨吞」，黃牛黨無法「活動」，讓傎正的小市民稍稍有鬆一口氣主！　陳閒天啓</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>今天莫使人民失望！</h3>
<p>今天應該是政治協商　　閉幕的日子。兩週宏論，爭辯不休，展期三天，又已屆滿。全國人民，對於協議佳音之傳播，仰望情緒，至爲迫切。然而據重慶日來電訊，不是說會議入於「微妙階段」，就是說「任務能否完成，仍是疑問」。費了三十八位黨派健將社會賢達十七天的脣舌，勞心苦思，夙夜不懈，倘今天仍不能拿出什麼合理合法的具體辦法來，結束國家的內亂，開拓民治的基礎，將何以對得起人民？政協諸公，在會塲上沒有一個不是以代表人民自居，但不知有幾個眞正了解人民的眞意！老實說吧，人民今日之所期望，依然簡單明瞭，不外還軍於國，還政於民八個大字，其他任何花言巧語，　是枝節。諸公自問，在這衆口紛呶的十七天中，有否把這八個大字商量出一個眉目？如果協商而不次定，或商定而不實行，或縱實行而並不澈底，或不澈底實行而並未執行懲處，則此十七天的協商，無論大會也好，分組也好，依然落了個「商」而不「協」，豈非白費了精神？人民對國事的失望，將無過於此。但今天國家大局，切不可再使人民失望，故政協只許成功，不許失敗。</p>
<p>然而，會議形勢，在「微妙」中依然不容華爾樂觀。爲什麼　主要原因，就是在：參與會議的大員們，一部分人有誠意，而一部分人却未必！我們但願此言之不中，但我們又深憂此言之雖不中，亦不遠。」我們平說，如果大家沒有爲國爲民的誠意，則協商爲多此一舉。何以今天還不能看見各方面都掬出他們的誠意來呢？我們且看看：這十多天究竟議了些什麼？</p>
<p>軍事組原是要議出還軍於國的辦法來的，但軍事調處執行部雖已開始工作，且停止衝突命令頒發了十幾天，而各地仍有接觸，這已使人民留一惡劣印象，加之整編共軍早經商定另組三人小組負責進行，而目前共黨又欲與全國軍隊整編混爲一談，藉以拖延時日，共黨於此次協商時，竟遺忘了「雙十會談紀要」，把三人軍事小組的權力削弱了，甚至說共軍接受政府命令，須待憲政實施以後，難怪局部衝突，依然若斷若續，而他們對於「還軍於國」，究有幾分誠意，自必路人皆知。</p>
<p>政府組織組，究竟協議了些什麼，我們還不得而知，但說共黨堅主各黨派參加中央政府和地方政府，表面上要「聯合到底，」骨子裏乃是「分割到底，」眞令人不知道他們究竟有吾想到人民。人民對於政治制度，並無他求，只求在安定中由訓政而過渡到憲政，由國民黨依法還政於民，次不願見大家混水摸魚，假「聯合政府」之名，行分割政權之實。可是依共黨的主張，則他的區域，在「民選」「解放」這些好聽的烟幕之下，不容人家過問，而中央政府及其他省市地方政府，則共黨及各黨派均須分嘗一臠。換言之，則他們的如意算盤，乃「我的地方只是我的，你的地方也有我的。」是否公道，姑且不諭，我們只問：假使一定要聯合到底分割到底，究竟是否符合還政於民？我們人民只知道政權是整個的，整個的屬於人民，人民相信誰，就舉誰來代表行使，人民相信那個黨，就舉那個黨來代表行使。而今天共黨却自吹自擋大捧其三三制，說共黨在他的區域裏當選的只限三分之一（眞假，天曉得！）因此說國民黨在一切部門也不得超過三分之一。我們願再問一句，人民如果大家信仰共產黨，選舉共產黨，共黨爲什麼能够限制他們只選到三分之一呢？這種客氣是民主乎，非民主乎？反之，某地人民如果還不以國民黨爲不肖，多舉了幾個國民黨人，又有誰能够限制他們，剝奪他們？請體念中國老百姓還在初學民主，練習選舉，不要異想天開，杜撰名詞（如三三制之類），弄昏了他們的頭腦！如果這樣下去，中國將會吃了名爲「聯合」而實則「分割一的虧，永遠不會正正當當走上民主政治的大道，而國　黨「還政於民」的初願，也或竟因此而將變其質，變了分政於各黨派了。我們只要求國民黨誠心的還政於民　不要走錯了路，再讓百姓去受一番各黨各派的共同　　。</p>
<p>要之，我們要求的月標　單純：軍隊是應該歸　於　家；政權是應該還之於人尺；政治綱領，要簡單明膫　合國情；憲法草案，要根據三民主義五權憲法的精神　不容遠背；國民大會必須五月五日如期召開，原有代表依法有效，但可酌量補充，兼容並包。政協諸公，在會議閉幕以前，必須能够對這幾件大事，交出一篇合情合理的帳來，度幾可以不致使人民再有失望！</p>

<h3>眞茹附近軍火車爆炸　京滬車昨晨恢復　受驚旅客安抵南翔站</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前晚由北站開往南京之五〇二次混合貨列車，上掛四等客車二十節，煤車十四節，第X戰區兵站總監部軍火車三節，最後為車長車。原定五時三〇分開出，後因交車延遲，至七時三十五分始離北站。詎車行二十分鐘，離眞茹站十五公里處，第一節軍火車，忽然起火。</p>
<p>軍火爆發　紅光燭天</p>
<p>經車長周桃生發覺，急將儲汽管機扭開放，全部停駛後，冒險下車，將離軍火車前七節之啣接解脫，即令軍頭司機速將客車二十節，煤車七節，急駛南翔。此項迅速舉動，前後僅五分鐘，是時軍火已着火，相繼爆炸，火光燭天。周車長即繞道至附近通訊站，急電上海北總站報告，而二十節乘客生命亦於是時安全脫險。</p>
<p>連夜搶修　恢復通車</p>
<p>上海站接獲電吿後，即派軍務處長候或華，工務處副處長徐承礦，錫滬運輸段長歐陽秩，顧問李微塵，並救護員修路員工等數十人，分二批專車駛赴出事地點。其時爆炸未息，子彈橫飛，不得已直待至十一時，火勢稍殺，全體人員即行開始搶修工作。先將沿綫電話電報綫接通，並將爆炸車及煤車拖至揚旗站，一面派員馳赴南翔，命停留該站之五〇二次列車頭，重行灌水生火，繼續開行。全部修理工作，計四小時，於昨晨八時起，業已照常通車。</p>
<p>兵士跳車　四人受傷</p>
<p>車中所裝載之軍火多屬子彈，手溜彈等，易於爆炸之物。由武裝士兵六人守押，當爆炸時，押車士兵從車上跳下，其中一有四人受傷，一人傷勢較重，三人係皮膚輕傷，並無大礙。</p>
<p>肇事原因　正查訊中</p>
<p>昨據錫滬運輸段長歐陽秩吿本報記者，此次不幸事件，幸車長機警，處置迅速，致乘客無一死傷，路局方面將予以嘉獎。昨晚（廿四）本人奉命派赴出事地點照料，見爆炸附近三十公尺內，滿地均係彈痕彈片，路面僅損毀枕木十餘根，裝載軍火之三節鐵蓬車，則已損壞不堪，而煤車靠近之二節稍有損失外，餘均無恙。當爆炸時，附近居民曾起驚慌，惟經護路隊解釋，即告安息，肇事原因，已由憲兵將押車兵士三人，帶滬查問，至於本局事前　　三攷慮，掛車次序，車頭後爲二十節客車，次十四節煤車最後爲軍火車，蓋防止車頭火星散落。</p>
<p>北站入口　張貼劍網佈吿</p>
<p>又前晚因爆炸車兩肇事，原定由滬駛京之夜怏車，及昨晟一時之四等慢車，均於晟八時駛出，同時被阻於黃渡之由京駛滬快車，於九時正抵滬。上海北站總站長童士達，並於北站入口處張貼緊急通告云：查昨日（一月廿四日）由上北開出五〇二次混合貨列車，於下午七時五十分行經距眞茹站十五公里地方，因押草人看守不愼，有貨車一輛，引起爆炸。當由車長緊急冒險處置，將該車解下，所有旅客安全抵南翔站，並無死傷。嗣經本路有關各處高級員工，星夜親自馳往出事地點搶修，已於今晨（廿五日）八時，完全恢復，照常通車，特此通告。</p>

<h3>舊曆年關銀根緊迫　金鈔一致回小　新港票脫手者多</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因陪都行市微降，隔前頭寸異常緊迫，大戶本無意於此，走勢遂異常乏力，晨開微降，開後仍遭美鈔方面套賣者供給，自九一萬六步降至九〇萬大關內，惟此際逢低補空者稍殷，在九〇萬關邊盤旋殊久，但終以歲暮年尾，刺激毫無，近午再告不支，降至八九萬以下，午收八九萬二，較前收回跌二萬四，午後交易寥寥，現貨不脫午收價左右，隔日交易，開做稍穩，業內外意興闌珊，終鮮變化，期貨亦軋跌二萬四，銀樓飾金九萬六，紋銀八百元，銀元受日本提高銀價影饗，升爲四九〇元，暗息日拆一角至一角二，過年者一角四。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔缺少特殊刺激，進出都屬零散，陪都行市報小，晨開即微降爲一四六三元，賣戶接踵而來，套頭亦屬小數活動，迨午刻步退至一四四二元，午後仍在一四五〇元以內盤旋，平庸異常，結果下跌二十一元，港票昨稍軟化，印棉結款及僑匯稍止，老票回跌五元，新貨投機帮潰滅，依然殺出者多，續挫三元。</p>
<h3>投機心思冷落　股票迭見低價</h3>
<p>華股市感四面楚歌，大戶心有餘而力不足，多方鑒於不進則退，續有了結，籌碼突告鬆動，各股遂節節下游，中途雖有掙扎，無濟大局，午刻都以低價結束，潛勢尙告步軟，午收結果較前收計永紗跌一七〇元，美亞降一一〇元，信和跌五〇元，景福等三小熱各跌一成左右，各冷門亦退落少許。</p>
<p>外股小型中型雖跌而不多，巨型及橡皮則較不振，此乃銀根關係，底價吃重，有以致之，華股投機氣氛已見平息，外股似亦難逃例外，不過外股收市有定時，不若華股之漫無準則，雖疲而過程尙平，結果除怡啤外各股均稍軟化，會德豐則跌一二〇〇元。</p>
<h3>散戶苦頭吃足　公債節節下降</h3>
<p>公債多方不敢留戀，歲暮關係，銀根奇緊，債市更無大戶支撐，隔前某號吃進川帮銀行整數丙種，爲數頗鉅，昨市原擬待善價而沽，無如對手困難，出龍不易，欲售而止者數次，迨午刻不得不忍痛斬殺，丙種遂自一六三〇元逐漸打破四重大關，見一二九〇元低價，午收始由業中大戶維持，回出一三大關，結果較前收計甲乙跌一一〇元，丙跌二四〇元，丁一二〇元，戊一三〇元，一般心理對以前所傳種種奢望，漸告幻滅，又苦了一般散戶矣。</p>
<h3>紗市供不敷求</h3>
<p>昨日紗市堅穩如故，客銷異常活躍，布廠採購允殷，各支紗錢又升二萬上下，十六支光明同行買賣甚夥，價自四十四萬五千元至四十七萬收盤，紡建公司續有供售，然已漸呈供不敷求之概，人心向榮，趨勢仍挺。</p>
<h3>花價緊俏　棉布交易稀</h3>
<p>棉花交易較爲减色，祇中紡紗廠進四十二支原料美棉米得林花價六萬二千元，係送廠價，此外花號進十六支原料火機花價四萬二千及四萬四千元，籽花開價八千二三百元，以上均棧交，價格比上日爲緊。</p>
<p>棉布市塲，執貨者如爲實力派，則不願再事出售，蓋明春紅槃如何？尙未能卜，反之，資金係向行莊透支而來者，現屆大結束期，亦吿了結，故成交冷落非凡</p>
<h3>絲市步軟　綢貸類皆呆滯</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲一二〇天橋先做價一百十二萬元，繼做加起二萬元，下午價一百十三萬元，成交極少，棧單上午七十二萬有人賣出，下午喊七十三萬元，與現貨相差達四十萬元之鉅，實因有棧單將來出貨須補繳海關稅之傳說，以致棧單價未能見好，廠經價昨市各檔亦喊低，但持貨者皆扳住不售，可稱毫無交易，綢貨因客帮裝運費及稅款甚巨，大多改辦棉布，故去胃呆滯，昨晨市塲內掮客不滿同行直接交易，羣起爭吵，一鬨而散，各貨皆無成交，塲外交易，做價與上日相仿。</p>
<h3>人造絲配給　星期一繳款</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕當局配給絲織廠業人造絲原料，調查手續已畢，昨日該業同業公會開會議決，平均每一織機，可能配給人造絲半箱左右，定於廿八日星期一繳款，先行出貨四分之一，聞定價與市價約低一成之譜。</p>
<h3>粳秈續疲</h3>
<p>米情消化仍懈，再居下游，北粳續疲二三百元，南粳再小三四百元，糯米陰元步削四五百元，秈米亦跟跌三四百元，午時收盤，店方略有問津，形勢帶定，黃豆平疲，豆餅疲中帶定，麵粉逐步下降，再小百餘元，生仁明定暗疲，酒市穩定。</p>
<h3>白煤塊疲滯　柴炭零銷頗旺</h3>
<p>煤市交易轉淡，趨勢尙稱平穩，白煤篩塊依然不振，小子煤實貨仍缺，市况最俏，烟煤塊漲風漸消，但銷路尙續，柴衆行情參差，各路到貨尙續，尤以炭到貨最盛，鋼炭篩炭及松柴零銷頗旺，價格穩站，蒲包木炭品質較次，須經同業揀篩，方能應市，價格在跌不已。</p>
<h3>南北貸市勢轉穩</h3>
<p>南北貨以大結束期近，貨主大部不願再出，故叫價反高，市勢趨緊，現在僅零星成交，箱莊大式桂回開三萬八千七百元，中小粒不及三萬元，圓肉高至九萬許，次至三萬五千元，金山元枝九萬二千元，　莊大泡三萬八千元，次之三萬六七千元，刁靑糖三萬三千元，紅米上中莊三萬五千元，市象均呈穩定。</p>
<h3>綠茶銷路最旺</h3>
<p>邇來因農曆年關轉　即屆，本市紅綠茶交易日見旺盛，銷路愈活躍，買戶搜求益勁，人心亦興奮異常，趨勢鋒鋩畢露，且其中尤以綠茶最受歡迎，故高價陸續出現，紅茶行情緊穩。</p>

<h3>「客氣」「謙虛」的面具</h3>
<p>— 余惕</p>
<p>中國是禮義之邦，這句話是大家所公認無疑的，所以任何一切行動，都以「禮」字爲中心出發點。在一般人的心理中，所謂「禮」字，就是客氣，於是你客氣，我客氣，大家都客氣。</p>
<p>上館子搶惠鈔，上戲院搶買票，坐三輪車搶付車資，甚至在電車車廂中也可以看到搶買車票……東也搶，西也搶，我也搶，你也搶，大家都搶，把這個禮義之邦，變成了充滿虛僞的國家。這類客氣是禮乎？非禮乎？大家不妨捫心自問。</p>
<p>放開各位的眼請，看一看那些黃髮碧眼的人們，他們有沒有這種的蠢動？在理，東西是我吃的，代價應該由我付，戲是我欣賞的，車是我代步的……種種凡是我個人享受的，代價應該由我付。天下沒有「享了權利而不盡義務」的事。——在中國也許是例外的。</p>
<p>這樣說起來，他們不是沒有「禮」（客氣）嗎？不，他們是有禮的，你們看，他們在上船下車都能根據「女人先走」的信條做去，（這種行爲我國同胞也能够做到，但是爲數非常少）。在車廂中可以看到年靑力壯的靑年讓年老力衰的老年坐，……最　着的是他們對待顧客非常客氣，當你買畢東西的時候，他會對你說一聲「謝謝你」，甚至你沒有買東西，他也會謝謝你。假設是中國人，你多問他這件幾鈿？那件多少？他會不耐煩地對你翻一翻眼睛，這是爲什麼？</p>
<p>談到這兒，把筆尖轉一方向，談談中國人的「謙虛」。</p>
<p>上面設過中國是禮義之邦，所以不免有「謙虛」的美德（？）。開口：「兄弟才能薄弱，不能擔此重任……」。閉口：「敝人才學疏淺……」，一連串的講虛話。但是越是謙虛的人，社會越是看重他，尊敬他。要是你說實話，「我有資格辦理此事」，這句話不待你說完，四週的人異口同聲說你「夜郎自大」，「目空一切」。……</p>
<p>假使上司指定你辦理此事，或者公衆推定你爲天家服務，於是你的辭職信一封，二封地呈上去，內容不外乎「…才能淺薄…恐失所望…」其實，心中求之不得，表面上却裝做「退避三舍」，「假痴假呆」了。</p>
<p>新時代中，應該有新的姿態出現，凡戴有「客氣和謙虛」假面具的人，應該放棄它們了，因爲現在是必須「實事求是，決不虛僞號召」的時代！</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>借書的煩惱</h3>
<p>— 溯因</p>
<p>我自幼珍惜東西，不像別個孩子喜歡破壞，丟棄，而愛好收拾，保藏。這也是受了家庭環境的影響，因爲我的家人大都是愛好整潔的。尤其是對於書籍，我啓蒙時所讀的『三字經』『百家姓』，沒有一頁破壞，至今還保存無恙，往後年齡漸長，愛好整潔之癖更深，一本書讀過二年之久，不沾一點墨跡，沒有一隻捲角；一本字典用了二十餘年，除了形態舊一點，還是完完整整，沒有一頁破碎，脫頁。所看過的雜誌書報，更是平熨乾凈，跟陳列在書店裏的新書絲毫無異。</p>
<p>這是因爲我看書時有一種習慣，就是不濫加捲曲，硬拉，翻書時不用中指和食指夾起書頁，或是用指拇指甲刨起書角，而是指拇輕輕的在書邊翻起的。同時我的手上，桌上也保持淸潔，所以絕無油漬汚垢染上書本。書一經看畢就安置好。不亂丟亂塞。</p>
<p>可是近年來，我的書不能再保持從前那樣的整潔了，因爲環境的改變，我的書不能再　我祗容我自己一個人看了。親友們問我要，我不能不給他們看，我也樂於給他們看，因爲，我願意他人也能從那些書中得到智識，啓示和樂趣。</p>
<p>不幸，等到物歸原主時，跟拿去時面目全非了：本來是平平熨熨的，現在是佈滿了摺痕，皺紋；本來是乾乾凈凈的，現在是染上了油漬，汚垢，書頁中有時還夾着西瓜子或香葵子的壳化　更糟些，書脫出了頁，封面，封底與本身祗剩得幾分皮肉相連了。看到了這副情景，我的心頭不由不冒起一股無名火來。但是在他們，却除非是書的本身撕破了，其餘的他們根本不算做一回事。即使書的本身撕破了，他們會陪你一個笑臉，不是怪討厭的孩子，便是怨可惡的耗子，你不但不能斥資他們，還得陪還他們一個笑臉呢。何况，我的肝火雖大，膽量却小，我根本沒有斥責他們的勇氣。曾有一次一位同事問我借小說，爲了怕又要弄到『焦頭爛額』，所以預先知照她：『書不要弄壞』，但她悻悻地的回答了我：『我又不是小孩子，我先生也做過呢！』從此我便不論在事先事後，都不敢再說半句話了。</p>
<p>書弄糟了，雖然我不再有那胃口去保存它，但把它撕了生爐子，或是論斤當廢紙賣掉了，那也沒有甚麼了。成問題的却是向他人借來的書給人弄糟了，我却要負上責任。爲了這，若是可能的話，我往往把借來的書不讓人見到。可是我又覺這樣太自私了，阻礙了智識的傳播。同時却又覺得保持書的完整是我的責任。</p>
<p>於是我煩惱了—是個不算大也不算小的煩惱：我應該不應該改變我的整潔性癖，以理智來消滅我的　名火？遇到向他人借來的書應該轉借給人家以利用這傳播智識的機會呢，還是不轉借給人家以盡我保持書的原有的完整的責任呢？</p>
<p>我認爲我的愛好整潔的習慣是好的，是不錯的。假如大家都有我這種習慣，書店裏的老闆也許要大皺其層，但圖書館的館長却要額手慶幸了，他圖書館裏的書籍的壽命至少要延長數十倍，這就增加了每一本書的效用，同時也就節省了國書館裏無數的金錢，以及修補，裝訂的工夫和材料。我認爲這一習慣正是每一個大國民所應看的。不愛好整潔是我國人的惡習，病態。無論個人、家庭，社會都處處表現着不整、璣蘇、雜亂無序的現象，這是引起外國人義視我們的一個重要的原因，我不但不　該捨巴從人，改變我團有的習慣，更　負起糾正他人不良習慣的責任。可是怎樣去糾正他們呢？我沒有指實的勇氣，也沒有婉辭規勸的塵術。爲了一本書的整潔而換取了人家為反感，那似孚有些小題大做，得不償失；因為能承認他們的錯誤的人是不大有的，能接受你的敎調而糾正他們的習慣的那是更難得了，那末你又何必去做這種徒勞無功的事呢？</p>
<p>於是，我時常被那些由我的習辦，責任感和怕懼互相發生的矛盾所攪擾着，而感爾了不大也不小的煩惱！</p>
<p>小品</p>
<h3>失去了的溫情</h3>
<p>— 張篷</p>
<p>星期日寄兒張遙來看我，我在無意的覺察間，瞧視他脚上穿的一雙藍布鞋子，心裏便有一種影子在幌動，腦裏也有一個影子在轉旋，可這鞋子是他底母親做給他穿的吧？』我明明想的不錯，但我還要問他：『遙，你脚上底新鞋是你媽給你做的嗎？』</p>
<p>「是的，是媽給我做的』</p>
<p>『遙，你要好好的穿，別任意蹧蹋，』我多麼羨慕他；我羨慕他有母親給他做鞋子。『啊！母親，母親底溫親慈情，多麼深密，多麼濃厚！』我底眼熱烘洪地像要掉出眼淚來了。</p>
<p>想到過去底從前，我也有母親，我底母親也替我做了不少的布鞋給我穿，可是我終是哭喪着臉，猶嫌鞋子做的不好；式樣做得不合乎我現想中的美觀。我跟媽嘟起嘴吵：『媽，你做的鞋一點也不好看，怎能叫人穿出去見人呢？』</p>
<p>『乖囝，鞋已做好了，你要穿好看的鞋，媽下次替你再做就得啦！』媽仍是綿綿柔情地忍着氣：『這鞋子底式樣還不算差，你姑且穿穿看。』</p>
<p>『不要；不要，我不要穿那種丟臉的鞋子！『我鼓着氣，將鞋子努力朝桌上拋擲，轉身跑了：『我不希罕這樣的鞋，我情願赤足！』</p>
<p>媽是柔懦底女人，她愛護爸爸，她也愛獲子女，她當時看我那樣眼淚汪汪地生氣的樣子。她不動怒駡我，她却悄悄用手帕去揩眼睛了。我知道媽底心傷了，我知道媽哭了。我底心眞狠，祗願自己生氣，毫無愛憐媽底苦懷，一個兒發獃樣的把自己關在房裏，嘰哩咕嚕地說些向己以爲很痛快的自語。</p>
<p>我道樣的態度，我這樣氣忿的態度，使媽好幾天很不快樂。</p>
<p>現在我沒有母親了；我已成了個失去了溫情的人了，沒有人給我做鞋穿了，自已要穿鞋，祇好去買價錢很貴的鞋來穿。我想到從前，再想到現在，我不禁眼淚簌簌地暗自悲傷了。</p>
<p>挺使我遺憾終身的，我爲什麼不留剩一雙穿舊的破鞋呢？非但可給自己留個永遠的紀念，而瞧了別人底脚上穿着他（她）們底母親做的鞋子時，自已也可聊以自　地檢出小時候破翟的鞋子來觀摩一番，讓我緬思母親往時對我一片愛慈的親情，可恨復可恨的，我連這個也得不到了。唉！我何處去檢覓母　留與我底溫情的遺痕呢？</p>

<h3>Constitutional Draft Group of the Political Consultative Conference Confirmed: Provinces as the Highest Autonomous Units, the Conference Expected to Conclude Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Chongqing Office, 25th] The various subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference continue to deliberate on the issues under their respective purview, making considerable progress. The Constitutional Draft and Policy Guidelines groups have entered their final stages, with the Constitutional Draft group achieving the most. In addition to the bicameral system for government organs, they have also confirmed that provinces will be the highest autonomous units, with provincial systems, provincial constitutions, popularly elected provincial governors, and balanced powers in their relationship with the central government. It is observed that the rigid and inflexible method of exercising five powers through five parallel and independent Yuan (branches) will be adjusted. The revision of the Five-Yuan system to make the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan government organs will significantly reduce future constitutional disputes and difficulties. Most of the Policy Guidelines have been agreed upon, and only further discussions are needed on the specific provisions of the government organization portion. The Military Group remains the most contentious, but an agreement may be reached within days. If progress continues smoothly, the conference will hold its closing ceremony on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] The subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference have been meeting for several days. As of the 25th, the Government Organization Group has met six times, the Policy Guidelines Group seven times, the Military Group four times, the Constitutional Draft Group four times, the National Assembly Group twice, and the Comprehensive Committee once. It is learned that the Military and Constitutional Draft Groups completed their consultations today, reaching agreements on various issues. The Policy Guidelines Group is expected to conclude its work tomorrow, while other groups still need further consultations. The Comprehensive Committee was originally scheduled to hold its second meeting today, but it was not held due to time conflicts as many members were participating in the Military and Policy Guidelines Groups.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] Amidst diminishing hopes for a smooth conclusion to the current Political Consultative Conference, the ten-member Comprehensive Group sought a compromise this morning on the conflicting reorganization plans of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The conference encountered a snag because the Kuomintang was unwilling to accept the Communist Party's demand to establish a joint military commission responsible for the reorganization work. Official sources said that the government reorganization has been stalled due to this difficulty. The Political Consultative Conference was originally scheduled to end on January 26, but there are now various signs that it may need to be extended to the end of the month.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] Although the delegates have not expressed pessimism about the conference's future and generally hope for continued progress, based on tonight's situation, the Political Consultative Conference appears likely to conclude tomorrow without resolving various problems. Issues such as government organization, troop numbers, and the National Assembly remain unresolved, but each subcommittee has reported some progress. The outcome of Chairman Chiang's meeting with Zhou Enlai is approaching the agreement stage. Many believe this concerns constitutional issues.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 25th] Key representatives from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party held a meeting today at the Political Consultative Conference to address some of the difficulties surrounding major issues, while the conference's subcommittees continue to work. A government spokesman stated that although a general agreement has not been reached, it is inaccurate to say that negotiations have stalled. Neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party has adopted an obstinate attitude, and the overall situation remains fluid.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Have Withdrawn from Chifeng: Local Security Maintained by Local Militia, Executive Headquarters Guangzhou Group Arrives in Guangdong by Air</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 24th] The Executive Headquarters' mediation efforts have made significant progress. The group sent to Luoshan, Northern Henan, has persuaded the government and Communist generals to agree to an immediate ceasefire. The group sent to Datong reported that there are no conflicts within a 70-mile radius of the city. Railway disputes near Xuzhou persist, but U.S. representative Hollist reported that the conflicts have decreased. Negotiations are underway in Jining. The group sent to Chifeng has made contact with both sides. Soviet troops withdrew from Chifeng on the 23rd, and the Executive Headquarters has requested the local security force to maintain security.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 24th] Tonight's communiqué from the Executive Headquarters indicates that when the Soviets withdrew from Chifeng (scheduled for yesterday), they handed over this important communication hub in Rehe to the Communist forces, not to the Nationalists. The communiqué stated: "The Soviet garrison in Chifeng withdrew yesterday as scheduled, and the supervisory team has requested the local security forces to maintain order." According to four American airmen who were detained by Soviet forces for seven days and released on Monday, there are no Nationalist troops in the Chifeng area, but there are some Communist troops. Recent news reports state that Nationalist troops in Rehe Province are at least twenty to thirty miles away from Chifeng. Therefore, most observers here believe that the "local security forces" mentioned in today's communiqué refer to the Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 23rd] The harmonious atmosphere within the Mediation Department gives the impression that peace is within reach, but the atmosphere outside the Mediation Department is the opposite, suggesting that numerous shadows are still cast on the path to peace. The most pessimistic political figures pointed out to reporters that since the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist side, through the Mediation Executive Department, has learned about the National Army's troop deployment and has consistently concentrated more than three times the strength to attack the National Army's weak points. As a result, the National Army has lost sixteen cities. It is said that in the battle of Yingkou, the Communist army even deployed twenty-four tanks, while the National Army there had only one battalion, leading to the city's capture. Yongnian in Southern Hebei is still under siege, but fortunately, the city is surrounded by water on all sides and has not yet been captured. The cessation of artillery fire in Jining is mainly due to the National Army's withdrawal. Recently, the Communist army has been frequently mobilizing, concentrating on the railway lines and appearing to advance towards Beiping and Tianjin. All of this raises doubts about the future of the Political Consultative Conference and the effectiveness of the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 25th] On the eleventh day after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party ordered a ceasefire, both sides continue to accuse each other of violating the order. The Communist army cited the Nationalist army's occupation of Shaduojiao near Hong Kong on the 15th of this month and the occupation of Mengcheng in Southern Shanxi on the 21st. The Communist army then recaptured two cities in Northern Shanxi that were lost after the ceasefire order took effect. The Nationalist army accused the Communist army of violating the order with the following facts: (1) The Communist army attacked Haizhou at the eastern end of the Longhai Railway; (2) The Communist army continued to attack Yanzhou in Shandong; (3) The Communist army cut off telegraphic communications in Xinyang. A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the Nationalist army intercepted an order from the Communist army authorities to their troops in Southern Henan, instructing them to plunder all food and conscript every able-bodied man.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th] The Guangzhou Investigation Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, consisting of six members, flew from Shanghai to Guangdong on the 25th, arriving at Tianhe Airport at 1:20 PM. The group includes U.S. military representative Colonel Miller, translator Feng Ruji, government representatives Major Huang Weiqin and Captain Ling Zhimin, and Communist Party representatives Major Fang Xu and Secretary Chen Hua. They are scheduled to visit Director Zhang Fakui on the morning of the 26th to begin their investigation.</p>
<h3>Ministries and Commissions Return to the Capital, Expected to be Completed by Early April</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Chongqing Office, 25th] According to reliable sources, the return of the government's ministries and commissions to the capital is expected to be fully completed by the end of March or early April. The National Political Council may still hold one more session in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Returns to Beiping from Changchun: On the Way, She Visited Wounded Soldiers in Jinzhou</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Madame Chiang flew back here from Changchun this evening. On her way, she made a three-hour stopover in Jinzhou, where she addressed Chinese officials and visited two army hospitals to comfort wounded Chinese soldiers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 25th] Madame Chiang left here on the Meiling airplane at 8:00 AM this morning, accompanied by Chiang Ching-kuo and Dong Yanping. They will make a brief stopover in Jinzhou to offer condolences to the troops and meet with Director Xiong and Commander Du before transferring to Beiping and returning to Chongqing. Before leaving, Madame Chiang instructed reporters to convey her parting thoughts to the people of the Northeast and to inform the people in China proper that she had completed her mission of comforting the Soviet troops and the people of the Northeast. She felt very happy during this trip, but regretted not being able to visit other places due to time constraints. When Madame Chiang left here, senior Chinese and Soviet officials in Changchun and representatives from all sectors of society went to the airport to see her off.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Changchun Office, 24th] On the third day of Madame Chiang's visit to Changchun, she visited the Soviet Military Headquarters at 10:00 AM. During the 1 hour and 10-minute visit, she was able to see all departments of the headquarters and asked many questions to the soldiers. A private from Ukraine gave concise and respectful answers to Madame Chiang's inquiries. At the banquet at the headquarters, three to five attendants in white coats shuttled between the tables. At noon, she attended a civic meeting and gave a deeply moving speech, stating that she would provide effective relief to the suffering people of the Northeast and would launch a fundraising campaign immediately after returning to Chongqing. She expressed her regret that she could not visit other places to offer condolences during this trip and hoped that those present could convey this message to the people in remote areas. In the afternoon, she attended a meeting with representatives from all sectors of Changchun and told the women's representatives that she would convene a national conference of women's representatives and visit orphanages. In the evening, she will watch a drama performed by the Soviet army.</p>
<h3>Profound Friendship of the Soviet Military Authorities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The Soviet military authorities hosted a banquet tonight to welcome Madame Chiang. The warm friendship shown by the senior Soviet generals towards President Chiang and his wife was the deepest this time, as revealed in the speech and toasts given by Lieutenant General Trotsenko, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army.</p>
<p>Trotsenko's Speech</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Trotsenko emphasized the traditional friendship between China and the Soviet Union and said that this friendship has become stronger because the two countries fought side by side against the common enemy and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. He believed that cultural and economic cooperation between the two countries is the foundation of lasting friendship. Madame Chiang's visit demonstrated the close friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Lieutenant General Trotsenko then wished the Republic of China boundless longevity and raised his glass to wish President Chiang a long life. He said, "We raise our glasses today to wish President Chiang good health. He is a great military leader and a great statesman. President Chiang has devoted his life to national affairs, always persisting and resisting Japanese aggression." Six other senior Soviet military officers also raised their glasses in succession to offer their congratulations, and their congratulatory remarks were as sincere as those of Lieutenant General Trotsenko.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang's Speech of Thanks</p>
<p>Madame Chiang immediately gave a speech of thanks, and cheers erupted. Madame Chiang first expressed her gratitude to the Soviet side for their hospitality and then said, "I now wish to call you friends of China and also friends of mine." She said in a conversation with Lieutenant General Trotsenko that the joy that this evening's grand occasion has given her is greater than any words can express. The Soviet government led by Chairman Stalin is a government of the people. Madame Chiang then raised the question of whether the Soviet people are friendly to China and answered it herself, saying that the Soviet Union provided assistance to China during the difficult period when China began armed resistance against Japan, not only helping us with aircraft but also helping us with flight personnel. The Soviet people are sincere friends of China, and I know this best because I was the Secretary-General of the Aviation Commission at that time. She continued to say that the Chinese people will never forget the Soviet Union's assistance to China. She mentioned the Soviet Union's recent assistance in recovering the northeastern provinces and said that the blood shed by Soviet soldiers in Northeast China has strengthened Sino-Soviet friendship. This friendship will last a long time because it is based on integrity and justice, and the cooperation between the two countries is also for the benefit of the people of both countries. China and the Soviet Union should maintain cultural and economic cooperation. Madame Chiang then raised her glass to wish Chairman Stalin good health, close cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, increasing happiness for Soviet women who have contributed to the war and peace, and expressed her respect for the bravery of the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Grand Reception Banquet</p>
<p>After the speeches, a color film of the recent Soviet anti-Japanese war was shown. This grand reception banquet held on the eve of Madame Chiang's departure then came to an end. Madame Chiang arrived three days ago and is scheduled to return to Chongqing on the morning of the 25th.</p>

They arrived at the square outside the National Government at 10:00 AM. First, the National Government sent someone to maintain order, and then members of the Political Consultative Conference, including Sun Ke, Zhou Enlai, Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, Shao Lizi, and Mo Dehui, spoke to the students in succession until 12:30 PM. After lunch, the entire group marched, distributing leaflets along the way, and the sound of slogans and singing resounded through the sky. Crowds gathered along the streets to watch the procession. The leaflets distributed jointly by the schools contained declarations to promote the success of the Political Consultative Conference, to declare the march, and to protest the Pingshan Airport and "Baeldin" incidents, addressed to the compatriots of the whole country. (A) Demands to the Political Consultative Conference: (1) National interests above all else, abandon factional selfishness. (2) Nationalization of the army. (3) Strictly enforce the ceasefire order to forever stop the civil war. (4) No political parties should interfere in schools. (B) Demands to the British Government: (1) According to the Atlantic Charter, Hong Kong and Kowloon should be returned. (2) Immediately stop the construction of Pingshan Airport. (3) Compensate the Chinese people for all losses and damages incurred as a result. (C) Demands to the French Government: (1) Replace the Consul-General in Shanghai; (2) War criminals should be immediately sent back to our country for trial; (3) Make a solemn apology to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tianjin, 25th] About 2,000 Chinese students held a meeting and parade at the racecourse road stadium today to celebrate the ceasefire order in North China.

<h3>Ministry of Communications Establishes District Telecommunications Bureaus</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Kunming Office, 24th] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications had assigned telecommunications receiving commissioners to various restored areas. It is learned that their tasks have been largely completed. Recently, the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications has issued an order to commissioners in various places to complete their work by the end of the month and hand over their work to the newly established district telecommunications bureaus to unify authority. The Yunnan-Guizhou District Telecommunications Bureau will be formally established at the beginning of next month. The new director, Chen Shuren, is on his way to Kunming from Guiyang.

<h3>China's Air Force Training Work Will Be Completely Self-Responsible in the Future; General Chennault Will Leave Kunming for Shanghai at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Kunming Office, 24th] General Chennault, who came to Kunming to revisit old places, will leave Kunming for Shanghai at the end of the month. According to discussions, China's air force training institution can be established in Kunming, but because the terrain is too high, it is not suitable for novice pilots. Training novice pilots in places such as Beiping, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou is more suitable than in Kunming. It is heard that the government intends to move the aviation school back to Hangzhou because Hangzhou is the birthplace of China's air force training, and its climate and terrain are suitable for this work. However, Chennault believes that the area is close to the coast and is not suitable for establishing a training center because it is easily threatened from outside. During the war, China's air force training was initially undertaken by aviation schools in Kunming and Chengdu. After recruit training, primary and advanced flight training were mostly undertaken by aviation schools established by China in India. Graduates from training in India could be sent to the United States for advanced training. Recently, more than 100 trainees who had received training in India have been ordered to fly back to Hangzhou and other places from India. The aviation school originally established in Kunming was ordered to stop training work long ago. In the future, all levels of air force training will be fully responsible by China.</p>
<h3>Military Headquarters Dispatches Personnel to Take Over American Military Supplies in Various Places</h3>

Each group has dozens of experts and technicians who have been transferred from units such as the Ordnance Department, ordnance factories, the Health Department, the Telecommunications Specialist School, and Jiaotong University, totaling more than 120 people. Currently, because there are more American materials within Yunnan Province, the Special Commissioner's Office is located in Kunming. The office's work is expected to be completed within two months.

<h3>Rehabilitation Area Coal Mines: Stepping Up Plans for Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, 25th] After arriving in Nanjing, Vice President Weng is stepping up plans to reorganize the coal mines in the recovered areas and is urging the repair of the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Hankou railways. Weng is firmly convinced of the current need to revive the industry in the recovered areas. Regarding the two major difficulties in the resumption of work at Hengkeng, such as the shortage of raw materials and power, he believes that they are not impossible to solve. As long as the coal supply is smooth and transportation is restored, work can be resumed in stages. Weng's view on eliminating the current labor unrest is that workers' living standards need to be adjusted, but during a period of continuous production, strikes are a great harm to the workers themselves, because labor unrest may stimulate prices, and the wages they can win may be offset by rising prices.</p>
<h3>Zhang Guowei Discusses Finance in the North China Region</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Beiping Office, 24th] Zhang Guowei, Special Financial Commissioner for the North China Region, told reporters: (1) The soaring gold prices in Beiping and Tianjin have been greatly affected by the gold prices in the Northeast. It is rumored that the ratio of Manchurian currency to legal tender is thirteen to one. The gold price there is about 15,000 to 20,000 Manchurian currency per tael, which is about 200,000 legal tender, so gold flows to the Northeast in large quantities. The government is currently studying countermeasures. (2) If the conflicts are completely stopped and transportation is effectively restored, the prices of goods in North China will inevitably fall, because food and cotton from the countryside and goods from sea transport can come continuously. (3) Tax collection in North China has already started from Hebei and Shandong provinces. The current monthly income of several hundred million is used for government expenses, and the expenditures are about the same. If the conflicts stop and all tax collection is restored, and supplemented by the income from reorganizing the enemy and puppet properties, there will be no problem with the finances of North China. (4) The situation of redeeming puppet "joint notes" in Beiping and Tianjin is good. In the past two weeks, about 10 billion have been redeemed in Beiping alone. The amount of small denomination legal tender is not as lacking as people imagine, because this type of small denomination legal tender has been less circulated in the rear and is stored in large quantities in banks, so it can be transported in large quantities for redeeming puppet "joint notes." (5) The head office of the puppet Mengjiang Bank is in Zhangjiakou, and the situation is unknown. In the future, if the situation permits, it is planned to go there to investigate and handle the Mengjiang currency, but no method can be formulated at the moment.</p>

<h3>Troop Reduction in the Xuzhou Pacification Zone: Headquarters of Field Armies and Army Groups Abolished; Tang Enbo, Feng Zhi'an, and Others Appointed as Military Region Commanders</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Xuzhou Dispatch, 25th] The reorganization of the troops under the command of the Xuzhou Pacification Zone has been largely completed. The headquarters of the field armies and army groups, originally under the Theater Commander's Office, will be abolished by the end of this year. However, to facilitate command, troop reorganization, personnel reduction, and local pacification, the directly subordinate forces of the Xuzhou Zone will be reduced to four pacification armies, with Tang Enbo, Wang Yaowu, Feng Zhi'an, and Liu Ruming serving as military region commanders. It is reported that the troop reduction in the Xuzhou Zone has resulted in the actual disbandment of five divisions. Furthermore, the Military Affairs Commission, noting that Feng Zhi'an had obeyed orders after the cessation of conflict, maintained calmness in difficult circumstances, defended the locality, and completed the protection of the Jiawang coal mine, which is vital to the nation's lifeline, has requested the National Government to issue a commendation order. The Military Affairs Commission has also rewarded the officers and soldiers of Feng's unit who were injured while protecting the mine.</p>
<h3>Harriman Leaves the Soviet Union; To Meet Marshall in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow Dispatch, 24th] The U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman, left here by plane today to return to the United States. Before his departure, Harriman stated that he intends to stay briefly in Chongqing to meet with General Marshall, President Truman's special envoy to China, and then proceed to Korea before going to Tokyo to meet with General MacArthur. It is understood that Harriman held a meeting with Marshal Stalin on Wednesday night. It is widely believed that his stops in various places on his way back to the United States may be related to the differing views between the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding developments in the Far East. Qualified diplomatic sources here believe that Harriman may not return to Moscow, as he has already settled his personal affairs before his departure. Some speculate that he will assume a position in the Far East or resume managing his industrial and financial interests in the United States. It is widely believed that in recent months, he has played a significant role in planning the Allied Far East policy, so that he can report the Soviet viewpoint to U.S. policy designers upon his return.</p>

<h3>After Heated Debate, Iranian Issue Included in Monday's Agenda; Soviet Representative Writes to Security Council Explaining Reasons for Opposition; Byrnes Left London for the U.S. the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] A London broadcast on the 26th reported that the United Nations Security Council decided yesterday afternoon to include the issues of Iran, Indonesia, and Greece on the agenda for Monday's meeting. A fierce debate reportedly occurred between Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the time. First, Bevin rose and delivered an impassioned speech, stating that any country, large or small, should have the right to file complaints. He had grown tired of hearing repeated accusations in closed meetings that the Soviet Union was threatening world peace, and therefore brought it up in a public meeting today. Bevin also said that the Security Council should allow the Iranian representative to present his case, but with regard to the Indonesian issue, Bevin suggested that it should be handled by the Dutch East Indies themselves. After hearing Bevin's remarks, Soviet representative Vyshinsky immediately rose and stated that although the General Assembly had included the Iranian issue on the agenda, the Soviet Union would not abandon its consistent position, meaning that the Soviet Union believes that the Iranian dispute is not a matter that the Security Council has the power to intervene in.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] A London broadcast on the 25th reported that Vyshinsky, the Soviet Union's chief representative at the United Nations General Assembly and Deputy Foreign Minister, sent a letter to the Security Council today expressing regret over Iran's complaint. Vyshinsky also stated that he was concerned about the Council's consideration of this complaint. He claimed that Azerbaijan's demand for autonomy was solely a matter between that country and Iran, and should be resolved through direct negotiations between the two countries.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 24th] Hours after the United Nations General Assembly unanimously decided to establish an atomic energy commission under the Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes abruptly boarded President Truman's special plane to return to Washington. Before his departure, Byrnes said that the United States supported the Security Council immediately and publicly discussing the issues of Iran, Greece, and the East Indies.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Hossein, broadcast today that the Iranian government has no intention of withdrawing its complaint against the Soviet Union to the Security Council. If the Security Council takes no action on this matter, then the Council will not survive and will already be dead. If the Security Council tolerates violence or aggression, it will sow the seeds of a third world war.</p>
<h3>Military Staff Committee to Convene Before February 1st</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] According to a London broadcast on the 25th, the U.S. chief representative proposed at the Security Council's public meeting today that a United Nations Military Staff Committee be convened before February 1st, which was passed, thereby laying the foundation for the military power of the world organization.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 25th] At today's public meeting of the United Nations Security Council, one item on the agenda was to provide the Security Council with military force to enforce peace. The step to take was to establish a Military Staff Committee to implement one of the clauses stipulated in the United Nations Charter, namely that the Security Council should decide on measures as soon as possible to establish a special force of the United Nations to guarantee peace.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 25th] The United Nations Security Council will take its first step today towards a plan to allow the Council to deploy "teeth," meaning troops, from member states to maintain world peace. The eleven members of the Security Council must also decide how and when to review the disputes in Iran, Greece, and the Dutch East Indies presented by Britain and the Soviet Union. The meeting of the Council scheduled for this afternoon is expected to adopt the previously proposed directive to immediately establish a Military Staff Committee composed of the "Big Five" chiefs of staff or their representatives. The drafting of "special agreements" regarding the quantity, quality, and ease with which the Security Council can deploy international forces will be undertaken by these military leaders. However, the main task of the Council will be to decide how to deal with the "current situation" disputes in places like Iran. To prevent unexpected changes, the Security Council is expected to hear a preliminary report next week before attempting to adjudicate the value of these issues and whether it will take any action. British officials have repeatedly stated that Foreign Secretary Bevin is extremely eager to have "the earliest opportunity" to "explain and defend" Britain's policies towards Greece and the East Indies. There are signs that a fourth political dispute may be raised in the Security Council. According to news from Lebanon, the government is instructing its representative attending the United Nations General Assembly to bring the issue of Allied troops still stationed in Lebanon to the Security Council. At the same time, on the international stage, the Greek issue may become more complex due to the signing of a financial and economic agreement between Britain and Greece (with the participation of the United States). Some observers believe that this will give those who criticize Britain's policy towards Greece more opportunities to criticize. They may use this to accuse Britain of attempting to control the Greek economy, because the British-Greek economic agreement is closely linked to the subsequent elections in Greece.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Korean Issue: The Course of the Three-Power Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 25th] Moscow broadcast today that some newspapers in the U.S. military occupation zone of Korea had published news implying that the Soviet Union wanted to establish a trusteeship system in Korea. This report is completely inaccurate. The authorities have authorized TASS to deny it and publish the facts. It is claimed that the United States proposed at the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference that Korea could be jointly administered by China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the transitional period, but later withdrew this proposal and supported the Soviet proposal. The Soviet Union advocated the immediate establishment of a provisional democratic government in Korea, jointly supervised by China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but limited to five years. According to the U.S. plan, Korea would be jointly administered by the four countries for ten years.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Decides to Participate in the Trial of Japanese War Criminals</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 25th] It was learned today from authoritative sources that the Soviet Union will send a representative to participate in the international tribunal to try Hideki Tojo and other war suspects. The Soviet Union will send a prosecutor to assist Chief Prosecutor Keenan, but the list has not yet been released. The trial is expected to be held in the former Japanese Ministry of the Army before the end of February.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] British judges Carl Heathley and Davis, along with 36 others, came here yesterday and, after a meeting with U.S. officials, departed for Tokyo this evening to participate in the trial of Japanese war criminals.</p>
<h3>U.S. Mechanics Repair the Engine of a Constellation Transport Plane</h3>
<p>The plane has an engine cowling, somewhat similar to the hood of a car, that can be opened at any time, allowing mechanics direct access to inspect the engine.

<h3>Earth and Moon Have Made Contact: Using Radar as the Medium</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 24th] The Department of the Army announced today that scientists from the Army Signal Corps have successfully made contact with the moon using radar in an experiment. This event will be of great value in both peacetime and wartime applications. The experiment was conducted at the Evans Signal Laboratory in Belmar, New Jersey. The first contact with the moon was made on the 10th of this month, and there have been several successes since then. During the experiment, special equipment was used to transmit extremely high frequency energy waves into space at the speed of light, and the echo was detected approximately half a second later. The moon is approximately 238,857 miles from Earth. One application of this experiment may be to use radar to control the launch of long-range jet-propelled rockets orbiting the Earth in the stratosphere.</p>
<p>[United Press Los Angeles, USA, 25th] After the U.S. Department of the Army announced that it had made contact with the moon using radar waves, Australian retired officer Major Osborne said today that the Australian scientific community had made contact with the moon using radar as early as 1941. Australian scientists at the radar physics laboratory at the University of Sydney used high-powered radar equipment to transmit waves to the moon and immediately detected its fluctuations, which occurred intermittently every 2.4 seconds.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 25th] The Royal Navy icebreaker HMS Protector yesterday conducted a secret test of ultra-shortwave instruments while navigating blindly in the Thames Estuary. Despite the congestion of ships in the estuary, no collisions occurred. It is expected that all British merchant ships will be equipped with radar equipment within one or two years, allowing them to navigate in any weather conditions. During the test, the captain, inside a closed wheelhouse, used the indications on the radar screen and a microphone to issue commands to the helmsman 30 feet away. The screen showed bridges within two miles and ships moving and docked in the river. Based on these instructions, the helmsman steered the ship, and as a result, nothing went wrong. Only a few hours after this test, news came that a British merchant ship and an American oil tanker had collided near Goodwin Sands in the English Channel due to poor visibility, both suffering severe damage.</p>

<p>[United Press Moscow, 25th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kerr, said today that he is scheduled to fly to Cairo tomorrow to meet with Dutch Deputy Governor-General Van Mook, and will then travel from Cairo to Japan to participate in negotiations on the East Indies independence issue.</p>
<h3>French Three Parties Announce Political Truce; Coalition Government to Be Formed</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] A London broadcast on the 25th reported that the new French cabinet is expected to be formed tomorrow. New President Gouin met with leaders of various parties today, including Communist Party leader Thorez and Progressive Christian Democratic Party leader Mendès France, totaling ten people.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 24th] The three major parties in France, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the People's Republican Movement, formally announced a political truce today in order to jointly participate in President Gouin's new government. The three parties have reportedly reached an agreement on the candidates for the new government and its platform. The position of Foreign Minister will belong to the People's Republican Movement, the position of Minister of Economy will belong to the Socialist Party, and the positions of Minister of the Army and Minister of Social Welfare will belong to the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bureaucratic Political Tradition Broken; Ministry of Home Affairs Completely Reorganized; Nearly Half of Local Governors Replaced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo Special Dispatch, 25th] After the Japanese government passed the cabinet's resolution on reorganizing the Ministry of Home Affairs, it dismissed 28 of the 47 local governors and appointed 28 new local governors. Previously, Japanese local governors were all officials who, under the leadership of Koichi Kido, formed a bureaucratic political group. This major reorganization has broken the tradition of the bureaucratic group suppressing the Japanese people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo Special Dispatch, 25th] Major reorganization of Japanese general prefectural governments took place today. According to exclusive news from the Jiji Press, Minister of Home Affairs Mitsuyama Tadao retained and selected prefectural government personnel for 28 prefectures to replace those affected by MacArthur's fourth purge order. The new prefectural government personnel will pay their respects to the Japanese Emperor this afternoon and will be announced immediately. If this reorganization can be realized, it will be one of the most important reorganizations of the Japanese government in recent years. The position of Japanese prefectural governor is comparable to that of the provincial chairman in China. The number of 28 prefectural governors removed this time exceeds half of all 47 prefectural governors in Japan.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Respects Women's Rights; Liberates Japanese Prostitutes</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 24th] The Japanese have a centuries-old custom of selling their daughters into brothels. Today, this has been prohibited by MacArthur's order. MacArthur ordered the Japanese government to abide by the Potsdam Declaration's guarantee of "respect for fundamental human rights," and therefore it must abolish all laws relating to public prostitution and all indentures that bind women. Brothel licenses have recently been banned, but the laws permitting the sale of daughters still exist. Two weeks ago, the Tokyo Brothel Operators Association resolved to liberate prostitutes, abolish indentures, and allow them to operate independently.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bear the Cost of Occupation Forces; Now Exceeds 700 Million Yen</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo Special Dispatch, 25th] The Ministry of Finance announced that the Allied occupation of Japan, up to the end of last year, had cost defeated Japan 700,119,200 yen.</p>
<h3>Brothers in Difficulty: One Wants to Go to Heaven, One Wants to Go to the Sea</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] Dr. Jean Piccard, Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, plans to ascend 20 miles into the stratosphere in a balloon, five miles higher than any human has ever been. His brother, Auguste Piccard, is currently conducting research in his hometown in Switzerland, planning to descend 13,000 feet into the ocean depths. The two are twin brothers who were both previously known for their balloon ascent research. Now, they reside in opposite hemispheres, one thinking of ascending to the heavens and the other planning to enter the sea, truly brothers in difficulty. Auguste's diving apparatus, modeled at the University of Brussels, is a sealed small chamber, weighing ten tons, constructed with copper plates. Its window glass is 18.4 inches thick to withstand the immense pressure at the bottom of the sea. Jean Piccard plans to ascend with his wife in a balloon, using a balloon never before used in stratosphere exploration, hoping to expand human knowledge of the upper layers of the atmosphere, paying particular attention to cosmic rays. This research will contribute to the development of atomic knowledge.</p>
<h3>At the Trusteeship Council Meeting: Gu Weijun's Speech – The Ultimate Goal of the Trusteeship System: To Enable the Governed to Become Independent and Autonomous</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Self-governance for all peoples of the world is one of the conditions for lasting peace. This point was raised by the US representative Dulles and the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Gu Weijun, at the Trusteeship Committee meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in Westminster Central Hall last night. Dulles proposed an amendment, seconded by Gu Weijun, advocating for the establishment of the Trusteeship Council in the latter half of the General Assembly's meeting in the United States. At that time, consultations can be held with the mandated powers to place the mandated territories under trusteeship. The committee will continue its meeting today, and will continue to discuss the American amendment, with representatives from the Netherlands and Iraq speaking.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 24th] The Chinese representative Gu Weijun stated in his address to the Trusteeship Committee: the trusteeship system will bring hope to millions of non-self-governing peoples. He expressed his pleasure at the statements of several United Nations member states, especially the decision of the United Kingdom and New Zealand to place their mandated territories under the trusteeship system. He said that this statement was extremely touching and demonstrated each nation earnestly hoped to establish the Trusteeship Council as soon as possible. However, statements made by other countries on this same issue have aroused our suspicion and unease. Gu continued, after the First World War, General Smuts suggested the idea of mandated territories instead of territorial annexation. This view was highly praised, and today this view has become more complete within the United Nations Charter's trusteeship system. Ownership of dependent territories should belong to the governed people. In mandated territories, the administrative authorities act on behalf of the League of Nations. One day, the people of the dependent territories will mature, and they will no longer be regarded as inferior but as equals in the international community. Millions of people will see the United Nations Organization as a "reliable protector of their welfare." The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that the independence of the people of dependent territories should be the ultimate goal of the trusteeship system. The rules of the trusteeship system should be as clear, broad, and generous as possible. Chapter XI of the Charter stipulates the obligations and responsibilities of the administering powers, which is "a cornerstone of the new peace tower" representing a "far-sighted and statesmanlike policy." China attaches great importance to this charter. The obligations contained in the Charter are a major step forward, and on the basis of these obligations, countries should govern mandated territories, not placing their own interests above the interests of the governed people, as their sacred duty. In the hearts of the Chinese people, Chapter XI of the Charter is a torch illuminating the path to self-governance for millions of non-self-governing peoples. When the governed people reach maturity and can govern themselves, and join the international community, one cause of unrest and anxiety in the world will be eliminated, and the world will enter a smooth path of tranquility and harmony.</p>
<h3>UNRRA's Forty-Eight Nations to Meet in Shanghai Early Next Year; Two General Assemblies to Be Held in the US and Europe This Year; UNRRA Purchases Barges to Transport Supplies to China's Inland Rivers</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] The highest administrative officials of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) announced today that the forty-eight nations participating in UNRRA will meet in Shanghai early next year. UNRRA is currently guiding the preparations for this major conference, but there will also be two general assemblies held this year. The Shanghai meeting will be the closing meeting of UNRRA. The first of the two international conferences this year will be held in a few weeks, roughly in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the United States. The second is expected to be held in Europe in the autumn. According to reliable sources, UNRRA plans to close down after one year. The Chinese side hopes that UNRRA's highest guiding authorities will come to the Far East before the closure. UNRRA administrative officials have indicated that it is unlikely that China and the Philippines will be able to obtain expanded relief above their allocated amounts, as UNRRA has no extra funds and cannot reduce relief efforts elsewhere. The relief that China has obtained has been the highest since the establishment of UNRRA's budget, totaling $675 million. The Philippines received a total of $3 million. The supplies already allocated to China should prove to be the highest amount that China can absorb within a year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] In order to advance the Far East relief plan, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has decided to send a special delegation to the Philippines and China within days to purchase 100,000 tons of barges in order to transport relief supplies to China's inland rivers. The delegation consists of three people, led by Swanson, who will first go to Manila to obtain surplus naval and marine vessels there. The agency will purchase various types of boats with millions of dollars and ship them to China as soon as they are acquired.</p>
<h3>The Old US-Thailand Treaty Remains Valid</h3>
<p>[US News Service, Washington, 24th] US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson issued the following statement: After the United States and Thailand resumed normal diplomatic relations, the United States has repeatedly held talks with the Thai government. Both countries acknowledge that the treaties and other international agreements signed between the United States and Thailand before the outbreak of the war in the Far East remain in effect. The treaties and agreements involved in the talks include the Treaty of Friendship, the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of January 13, 1937, and the Final Protocol, the Memoranda exchanged between the two parties, the Extradition Treaty of December 30, 1922, and the Agreement to Abolish Passport Inspection Fees of 1925.</p>
<h3>The Commander of the US Army Air Forces is Succeeded by Spaatz</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] President Truman announced today that General Arnold's resignation as Commander of the Army Air Forces has been approved, and his vacancy has been filled by Spaatz. General Spaatz has served with distinction in the European and North African theaters and was later the commander of the strategic bomber force in the Pacific theater. The B-29 aircraft that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima was under his command.</p>
<h3>China Purchases Ten Ships from the US</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 24th] Local newspapers reported today that China has purchased ten Z-B type ships from the United States for use in its shipping industry, at a price of $4.32 million.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Planning to Repair the Kunshan-Taicang Highway: The local authorities of this county, considering that the Kunshan-Taicang Highway has been in disrepair for many years and has greatly affected transportation, have formulated a repair plan. Within a short period, they will conscript laborers and rush to complete the repairs. The required funds of over 500,000 yuan have been submitted to the provincial government for approval.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Setting up a Petition Box in the Pacification Sub-division: The Third Sub-division of the Pacification Work Supervisory Group, in order to diligently seek the opinions of the people, has specially set up a petition box to receive confidential reports from all sectors of the public. Anyone who has suffered illegal harassment or injury from local bullies, ruffians, traitors, bandits, local officials, military police teams, or former underground work officials or soldiers during the period of enemy occupation is eligible to submit a petition. Once accepted, it will be handled impartially, without any favoritism.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Coal Mine Case: The High Court Orders Seizure of Evidence: The manager of the Baoshan Coal Mine Company, Li Pengfei, was reported for suspected collaboration with the enemy. The High Procuratorate has already detained Li Pengfei and Deputy Manager Mei Damo. In a bedroom of Xu Boming's daughter in Wanshi Lane, a Japanese man named Yamaga Tsuneharu (alias Yang Tiansheng) was arrested. He, along with Xu Boming and his daughter, were taken to the court for interrogation. Later, Mei Dahan and Xu Xin were released on bail due to insufficient evidence. The remaining individuals were detained pending trial. Yesterday, the court interrogated Yamaga, but since several antiques looted by the Japanese man in Suzhou had not yet been recovered, the court immediately dispatched bailiffs, accompanied by the suspect, to Xu Boming's house and Li Pengfei's house to seize several antiques for the record. After returning to the court, the suspect was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Request to Rush the Repair of the Shanghai-Yuyao Highway: The county government held its third restoration meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM, chaired by County Magistrate Fan Tisheng.

<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>Pirates Discovered on the Zhapu Sea: Yesterday, more than 300 pirates were suddenly discovered on the Zhapu Sea. They were constantly moving back and forth within hours. From the appearance of the river in Zhapu, between Jinshan and Haiyan, they seemed to be trying to land along the coast. The matter has been closely watched by the local garrison. The National Army and the Self-Defense Brigade are strictly preventing their actions and have begun a full town curfew, day and night, from last night to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>A Murder Case Occurred in Fengjie Bridge Town: In the Shengjiabang area of Fengjie Bridge Town, Jiaxing, there was a Sheng widow, in her thirties. Because her husband died early, she could not bear to sleep alone. Several years ago, she became acquainted with a butcher named Huang Laifu and had a child with him, who is now four years old. Because Huang was addicted to alcohol, he often argued with the Sheng woman after getting drunk. The other day, due to drunkenness, the two had a dispute. The woman threw a hoe at Huang, hitting him in the head. Huang immediately fell to the ground, his brains splattered, and he died on the spot. Seeing that she had caused trouble, the woman tried to cover up the crime. However, the child revealed the truth, and the chief reported it to the town police station, who arrested the woman and handed her over to the local court for investigation.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the General Life in America, Britain, and France Through the Eyes of Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in the United States: Overseas Compatriots Appear in "China World," Sent by Zhu Jiarang from New York</h3>
<p>Speaking of our Chinese compatriots in America, there are too many. "Chinatown" is originally a Chinese world, with Chinese characters, Chinese language, and Chinese newspapers being very common. It is said that in "Chinatown" in San Francisco, one can send letters in Chinese and make phone calls in Chinese, but this is mostly limited to the scope of the Cantonese old overseas Chinese. As for our dignitaries, wealthy gentlemen, celebrities, and scholars, I will now call them "high-class Chinese." One can run into them on the street at any time, especially during Christmas or New Year, when many come to New York to play. On the streets and in restaurants, men and women mingle and laugh. Listening to their accents, they are all "our precious compatriots," but they do not greet each other face to face and there is no feeling of "meeting an old friend in a foreign land." This is different from Paris and London, probably because there are too many people here, so it is not considered rare.</p>
<h3>Overseas Leisure, Ashamed of the Title of Doctor</h3>
<p>According to what I have gathered in the past few days, the "high-class Chinese" here generally live well. Many bring their wives and children, live in comfortable apartments, and lead a leisurely life. Of course, they must have some connections to be able to come here and enjoy themselves. But strangely, many people's hearts still seem to be full of resentment, full of complaints, either scolding the central government for being incompetent or complaining about being unappreciated. Some have the title of doctor and treat the people in their country as fools, arrogant and snobbish, and are still bringing shame abroad!</p>
<h3>People Hope for Stability, the China Daily is the Most Popular</h3>
<p>The news of the motherland seems to be more accessible here than in Britain and France.</p>
<p>First, there are many American reporters in China, and Chinese telegrams are more abundant.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are also four Chinese newspapers. Although they cannot obtain proper domestic news telegrams, they still have some news to read through Associated Press. Among them, the China Daily is the most complete, but its sales are not as good as the China Daily. It is said that the China Daily can cater to the "hearts" of most people who "hope for stability."</p>
<h3>American Production Has Not Yet Reached Normal Levels</h3>
<p>The prices here have also risen a lot compared to before the war. Fortunately, everything except sugar can be bought freely. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) has restrictions on various prices, but the black market is still unavoidable. If you have money, there is always a way. Under the current living conditions, a few hundred dollars can rent a public apartment with five or six rooms. If you eat out every day, a single person's food expenses will cost seventy or eighty dollars a month. Some daily necessities are cheap, and some are unexpectedly expensive. After all, peacetime production has not fully recovered. The watches and fountain pens that domestic friends welcome the most are still scarce. The watches are all new brands, and luxury tax is charged when buying them. I have never seen a Parker 51.</p>
<p>I have a few more observations, which I will record below:</p>
<h3>Although France is Weak, Its Advantages Cannot Be Erased</h3>
<p>Among the three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, the United States is naturally the richest and strongest, and France is currently the weakest. However, the French nation can never have its advantages erased because of its defeat. On the contrary, the French people's achievements in art and science, as well as their high level of culture from the perspective of their way of life, are by no means inferior to those of Britain and the United States. The city administration of Paris is very much up to modern standards, with all the facilities it should have. Before the war, France and Switzerland were famous for attracting European and American tourists to earn money. Unfortunately, after the war, they suffered great losses and deep pain, resulting in insufficient food and clothing, high living costs, and a difficult life for the people. They are now in the worst position.</p>
<h3>Despite the Storms, Britain Stands Firm</h3>
<p>Britain is in a better situation than France. The reason is, of course, that the degree of suffering is different. In fact, their political ability is extremely strong, they can come up with solutions, and they can implement them. The most popular material control can really achieve rationality and fairness. With this shared hardship and happiness, the order is also stable. Members of Parliament and public opinion argue with the government every day, and the government has to make everything public to Parliament, debating day and night. However, the country has a regular order and things are not chaotic. A country, an organization, has a particularly strong cohesion, so even after storms, it can stand firm. Everyone agrees that Britain did not win because of anything else, but because of this little bit. This spirit saved Britain! Let's talk about the United States. Yes, he won this war; but the Americans are like a smart, capable, and uninhibited rich man compared to the older, restrained, and respectable gentlemen of Britain.</p>
<h3>The Three Cities of Europe and America: Passionate, Proper, and Lively</h3>
<p>The three major cities of Paris, London, and New York are all crowded, but with different atmospheres. The French are full of love and affection everywhere, and men and women hug and kiss each other at any time. The British would never do that, and they all look like proper citizens, not smiling. The United States is too naive and lively. Compared to the British, it seems to have more vitality, but the shortcomings are unavoidable. The order seems to be slightly inferior. A famous city like New York is not as clean as London. Old newspapers, cigarette butts, and ice cream wrappers are often thrown all over the streets, and many people spit everywhere. The worst are the subway stations, which are far worse than those in London, and the stench of the toilets is too ridiculous. However, these places are certainly not all like that.</p>
<p>With victory, the domestic policies of all countries today are centered on the people's livelihood. However, restoration and reconstruction cannot be achieved overnight, so the people's lives must also progress along a curve. For example, in Britain, the current control system will continue for five years. The situation in France is even worse, and the people's belts must continue to be tightened, because in order to improve the standard of living, on the one hand, the supply should be sufficient, and on the other hand, wealth should be increased. The losses during the war must first be compensated. Export trade cannot be delayed, and self-consumption can only be saved. It is like a person who must first revive his career before he can relax and enjoy himself. Otherwise, simply eating and drinking as soon as the money arrives is not the right way. From this point of view, except for the United States, general life must be temporarily tightened, and the standard is not easy to improve immediately. Fortunately, Europeans seem to understand this very well. Their average incomes are low, so there is no way to increase purchasing power, so they will have to make do. This is very worthy of our Chinese people's special awakening. What qualifications do we have to talk about enjoyment at present? However, while the people are starving, the government also has its own responsibilities to protect the people and cultivate the people. Here, a comprehensive social security system is necessary, so that every person has insurance for unemployment, insurance for illness, and from the moment they are born to the end of their lives, they are taken care of by the state and society, so that no one lives in a situation of self-reliance. This is the first and most urgent task of all European and American countries today. Our people must also one day be cared for by everyone.</p>
<h3>Mechanical Development, Everything is Automatic</h3>
<p>Due to their machine civilization, everything is automatic. Making phone calls and buying stamps are often unattended. As long as the money goes in, the items come out. In some places, stepping on the steps opens the door, and a light touch produces water and fire. It is simply a kind of net of heaven and earth. However, although machines are very developed, there is still a shortage of manpower. Looking at the situation in Europe and the United States today, women have all come out of the kitchen: typing, secretaries, ticket sellers, salespeople, cashiers, accountants, and even waiters and workers. Women are in charge everywhere, and their work is quite hard, and the treatment is very ordinary. However, according to general observation, the service performance is very good, because they are physically fit and do things seriously.</p>
<h3>Women in Charge, Shifting Social Customs</h3>
<p>However, in this way, they are even more laborious when they have a family. It is too fanciful to find a servant. First of all, everyone can find formal employment, why be a servant for others; secondly, the wages are expensive, and ordinary people cannot afford to hire them. Therefore, housework can only be done by yourself. These women are talented both inside and outside, and they are indeed capable. Everyone is not idle. Social customs are therefore easily invigorated, and no one dares to be lazy or opportunistic, or rely on personal connections to muddle through. When they are free, they need male comfort. The most natural way is to seek entertainment with their husbands or boyfriends, and they will no longer look for idlers to play around with and cause trouble. Women are very respected in European and American societies. In Chinese society, women are also often the center in the shadows. Social customs are related to political and academic customs, and their recovery from decline always depends on women, so the relationship of female compatriots is really great.</p>
<h3>The Mine Searchers</h3>
<p>Three American sailors stand in the wheelhouse of a damaged American ship, hoping to find pressure-activated mines off the coast of Japan. These sunken mines were dropped by American aircraft before the unconditional surrender of the Japanese and are difficult for ordinary minesweepers to clear. They can automatically become ineffective after a certain period of time, but unless they are actually contacted, there is no way to prove that they have lost their effectiveness. There are three damaged American ships searching for mines, each carrying twenty-two sailors. The engine room is located on the deck, so that the sailors will not be trapped in the lower-level room and suffocate to death in the event of an accident. Thick pads are placed above and below the engine to slightly reduce the shock of contact.</p>
<h3>Man Can Conquer Nature, Compatriots Work Hard</h3>
<p>"Man can conquer nature," this old saying will never be worn out over time. The so-called "know yourself and know your enemy" is essential. What is the difference between Europeans and Americans and Chinese people? We have some shortcomings, and they also have them, as has been said above. Even though our country's current political and economic situation is difficult, we are not alone. The moral standards of the people may have declined slightly, which is also a fact. Are other people any exception? The prostitutes in Paris and London today are all over the streets, and the news of robberies is constantly reported in British and American newspapers. All of this is clear evidence. What is valuable is that the nation itself has ambition, can be inspired in time, and can strive for self-improvement. Everything will have a solution, and we don't need to be complacent! Furthermore, their great construction and prosperous politics and culture today are also the result of accumulation over time. We have plenty of people, so why can't we catch up and keep pace with them? There is no reason why they can do it and we can't. Based on this belief, the future of China in the next twenty years will be bright. However, we here cannot help but worry: If we only focus on the form and ignore the spiritual foundation, the result will be in vain. When will our politics be enlightened and powerful? More importantly, when will our entire country, from top to bottom, get rid of the mentality of making small calculations, splitting hairs, and only knowing how to plan for personal gain regardless of the overall situation? This is the key to the future fate of the country! (January 5th)</p>
<h3>An Exploration of the Wonders of Dazu Buddhist Statues: A Glimpse of Mature-Period Stone Carvings and Ancient Relics</h3>
<p>A Lecture by Mr. Zhu Jinjiang, Reported by Our Newspaper's Airmail Service</p>
<p>The following is a record of about one-tenth of the main points from a two-hour lecture given by Professor Zhu at the request of the Faculty of Arts at Fudan University's Academic Lecture Series, after being invited by local figures in Dazu, Sichuan, to conduct an investigation along with Mr. Gu Jiegang, Mr. Ma Heng, and others. (Jointly recorded by Zhang Jianqing and Shen Yunlong) It is said that his forthcoming books, "A History of Chinese Statuary" and "The Dazu Stone Carvings," will soon be published. (Editor's note: Dazu is located approximately one hundred li northwest of Chongqing)</p>
<p>The Transmission of Buddhist Statues to China</p>
<p>To study stone carvings and statues, one must first understand the history of Buddhism's introduction to our country. According to the "Records of Buddhism," Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty dreamt of a golden man one night. When he inquired of his ministers, they all identified it as Buddha. Thus, he sent Cai Yin and others to Tianzhu (ancient India) to retrieve Buddhist statues and scriptures. However, examining historical facts, this is likely impossible, as it coincided with a period of severed East-West communication. East-West communication effectively began in 138 BC, but at that time, the West had no Buddhist statues, only the Dharma wheel, stupas, Bodhi trees, and Ashoka trees. Even the Songxi Great Stupa and Yu Yuan, which originated around 130 AD, lacked Buddhist statues.</p>
<p>The creation of Indian Buddhist statues flourished during the time of the Kingdom of Gandhara. The Yuezhi king, Kanishka, was a devout Buddhist, and the Greek sculptural styles of the time were spreading to India. Thus, the carving of Buddhist statues began. In the sixteenth year of Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty's Yongping reign (74 AD), Ban Chao was dispatched to the Western Regions, and East-West communication became smooth. Zhang Qian, while in the Western Regions, had seen Qiong bamboo and Shu cloth, all transported there from our country by sea. At that time, maritime communication was already established, and Buddhist statues and Buddhist teachings were transmitted to our country from Nanjing. The Jin Dynasty monk Faxian went to India in the ninth year of the Yixi reign (399 AD). This coincided with the Gupta Dynasty, the peak period of Indian statue-making. When he returned to China (413 AD), he brought back Buddhist statues via Qingdao. Furthermore, the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang traveled to India via the northern route of the Tianshan Mountains in the third year of the Zhenguan reign (629 AD). At this time, many Buddhist statues in India had been destroyed, but he also carried back scriptures and images. Wang Xuance traveled to India three times, bringing back even more scriptures and images.</p>
<p>An Overview of Chinese Statuary</p>
<p>Statue-making existed in the Western Jin Dynasty, but none survive today. The Mogao Grottoes were built in the first year of the Taihe reign of Emperor Fei of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (366 AD) by the Qin Dynasty monk Le Zun. Initially, the Chinese people were unaware of them. It was not until 1903 that they were discovered by the Hungarian Aurel Stein. After returning to Europe, he praised them highly, leading to the subsequent arrival of the Englishman Stein, who used various methods to take away the essence of the grottoes, seventy large boxes, back to London. In 1907, the Frenchman Paul Pelliot also came to the Mogao Grottoes, taking over a thousand photographs. He returned and wrote "The Mogao Grottoes Catalogue." From this, the Chinese people began to learn of the Mogao Grottoes. The grottoes built by the monk Tan Yao in Yungang, Datong, Shanxi, during the sixth year of the Daming reign of Emperor Xiaowu of the Northern Wei Dynasty, along with the Binyang Cave in Longmen (Luoyang) built by the Northern Wei Dynasty around 500 AD, and various grottoes in Tianlong Mountain in Taiyuan, etc., from the late Tang to the Northern Song Dynasty, were the most prosperous period for statue-making in our country. The sculptor Yang Huizhi during the Xuanzong era was truly a great creative talent in the history of Chinese statue-making and a pivotal figure in the shift of styles.</p>
<p>In the early stages of statue-making in our country, it was nothing more than imitation. In the later stages, creation began. In terms of appearance, early statues imitated the appearance of Indians, gradually changing to resemble Han Chinese. Statues from the Tang Dynasty often had full faces, while those from the Song Dynasty were relatively thin, influenced by the era. As for the folds of clothing, they did not resemble the thin, translucent clothing of India, but rather repeated, rhythmic patterns. The headdresses in the Gandhara style were quite simple, while the headdresses in our country's statues were complex and detailed, with over twenty different styles. In terms of posture, Indian statues often sat upright, while Chinese statues often sat in the lotus position.</p>
<p>The Dazu Stone Carvings are divided into two areas: Beishan and Baodingshan.</p>
<p>The Current State of the Dazu Stone Carvings</p>
<p>(A) Beishan: Yongchang Village was built by Wei Junjing, the Tang Dynasty prefect. The statues date from the second year of the Qianning reign of Emperor Zhaozong of the Tang Dynasty (895 AD) to the sixteenth year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty (1146 AD). The various caves are described below:</p>
<p>(1) The Cave in Front of Weituo Heaven: The front of the cave features an image of the Northern Heavenly King Weituo Heaven (also known as the Heavenly King of Much Hearing). The Heavenly King is the protector of the Buddhist faith, and Wei Junjing was the prefect of Changzhou at the time. He built Yongchang Village here to protect the region, so this image is actually Prefect Wei. Beside the Heavenly King are two Yakshas. On the left is a donor with two pheasant feathers on his head, which is related to "ancient totemism." On the right is a Thousand-Hand Guanyin, but upon closer examination, it is Vishnu, not Guanyin, as its eyes are fierce, and it is often depicted as a Heavenly King. Similar statues can also be found in the Yungang Grottoes in Datong.</p>
<p>(2) The Back Cave: There are inscriptions about the statues, dating from the third and fifth years of the Yongping reign (915 AD) and the third year of the Qianning reign (896 AD). The statues include Guanyin, Dizang, and Amitabha.</p>
<p>(3) The Guanyin Cave: The statues are mostly blurred due to repeated repairs. On the left is an image with a scarf on its head, dressed like a court lady. In another small cave is an image with a flowing robe, extremely lifelike, clearly influenced by the painting styles of the time, with the charm of "Wu's flowing robes against the wind."</p>
<p>(4) The Tathagata Cave: Very large, it depicts the Tathagata preaching the Dharma, with donors, as well as images of Guanyin, Samantabhadra, and Manjushri. There is a Dharma wheel in front, but unfortunately, it is damaged. On the right side of the wall is an inscription depicting Manjushri visiting Vimalakirti to inquire about his illness, painted by Shi Ke of the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>England's Living Symbol: George VI - Can He Sit Securely on the Throne?</p>
<p>Since the establishment of a purely Labour government, the position of the English King has seemed theoretically paradoxical, although in practice, he has cooperated very well with the new government machinery, as if the English throne was originally established for today's socialist political experiment. Labour Party members have no intention of interfering with the throne in the slightest. On the contrary, just as European monarchs are collapsing one after another in the storms of leftism, the English system remains standing like the Rock of Gibraltar. From all perspectives, it is easy to believe that King George VI was born to cope with the current political crisis. George VI is a common man. If King Edward VII, the current king's grandfather, or his father, George V, or Edward VIII, who abdicated because of his marriage to Mrs. Simpson, were on the throne today, the situation would be completely different. These former kings were all strong-willed men who would often assert their royal authority in front of their cabinet, sometimes insisting on doing things according to their own views. Once, during an inspection of coal mines in Wales, he was so enraged by the poor conditions of the workers (of course, this is absolute) that he sternly said on the spot that something had to be done, thus rebuking his government, which was actually planning to improve the mining industry at the time. The English throne was originally supposed to be inherited by Edward, but fate caused George VI to ascend the throne. As for the Queen, she has a wealth of common sense and ardent loyalty, which is of great help to her husband. Her heart is really no different from that of a Scottish housewife, but she can carry out her duties with dignity and understanding. In short, the English King, the living symbol of the United Kingdom, is still sitting securely on his throne. (24th, Mackenzie, London)</p>
<h3>A Tour of Huangpu Harbor: A Revolutionary Holy Land Continuing to Shine</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng, Guangzhou</p>
<p>Although science has advanced to the age of atomic energy, if we do not deny that only 30 percent of the earth is land and 70 percent is ocean, then the navy naturally has its importance in national defense. Our country's navy was indeed pitifully lacking in the past. During the post-war reconstruction, the authorities paid special attention to building a new navy. Therefore, "Huangpu," a place with good naval port conditions, has not been neglected by the authorities. After the liberation of Guangzhou, the authorities first ordered the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau to draft a plan for the development of Huangpu, in order to accelerate its progress. On December 27th of last year, the US Naval Military Mission, led by Rear Admiral Merrell, along with seven officers, came to Guangdong to inspect Huangpu Port. Because Huangpu has the potential to develop into a naval base and deep-water port, I visited it in person the other day.</p>
<p>Two Clumps of Green Trees: Huangpu in Sight</p>
<p>On a clear and beautiful morning, a small steamer, shimmering in the golden light, carved a broken line on the calm surface of the Pearl River, heading towards Huangpu. After an hour and fifteen minutes of sailing, Huangpu emerged from a clump of green trees on the horizon. With an excited heart, I gazed at this place, inseparable from the revolution, as if seeing it emitting dignity and sacred light. We will not forget its contribution to China. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Huangpu Military Academy, its glory has remained to this day, and that glory has continued to shine from the Northern Expedition to the victory of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Vast and Strategic Waters: Fleets Gathered</p>
<p>The Huangpu waters are vast, controlling the Pearl River estuary and controlling the entire waterway, making the terrain extremely strategic. Three warships of 200 to 300 tons and twelve 25-ton gunboats berthed at the shore immediately caught our eyes. These were enemy vessels received by the Guangdong region and then renamed. Among them, the "Wufeng" was the largest of the three shallow-water gunboats, weighing 300 tons, equipped with two three-inch flat-trajectory guns, and capable of a speed of no less than seven knots. It is still navigable. The other two, "Victory" and "Revival," are river patrol ships, weighing 200 tons and 180 tons respectively. Originally, these two ships were equipped with steel cannons, but they had been removed during the handover and are now awaiting repair before they can be navigated, with a "speed" of about six knots.</p>
<p>Ships Berthed at the Docks: Scattered Like Stars</p>
<p>After visiting these warships one by one, we went to another dock. There were also countless ships there, berthed like stars scattered across the sky. Eight 25-ton wooden Pu-class gunboats and four 25-ton iron Te-class gunboats. These Te-class gunboats were equipped with a twin-barreled machine gun and several heavy machine guns, as well as searchlights. The speed reaches 12 knots per hour. These have all been reorganized by our naval authorities after receiving them. In the future, Guangdong will have three patrol fleets, and this group of ships is the Third Fleet. Colonel Huang Rukang of the Naval Commissioner's Office told reporters: "After the Hong Kong government hands over the enemy ships to our country, we will use them to train the navy. We are now preparing to establish a naval soldiers' training class and hire many American consultants and instructors to assist us..."</p>
<p>Two Dry Docks and Sluice Gates: Relics of a Century</p>
<p>Afterwards, we visited the naval shipyard. This factory was a product of the Zhang Zhidong era. The two dry docks and sluice gates, built over a hundred years ago, are still intact. However, because the riverbed is silted up 210 miles upstream and downstream, it must be thoroughly dredged before it can accommodate large ships. This shipyard can now only repair ships, not manufacture them. The factory has a forge, a foundry, and a sawmill, all powered by electricity. The foundry has two electric motors of more than 80 horsepower, and the power plant also has two generators of 42 horsepower. In addition, there are diving coppersmiths.</p>
<p>Japanese Prisoners Work at the Factory: Taking Time to Fish</p>
<p>The current director of the factory is Mr. Wu Qushi. There are 65 Japanese prisoners working in the factory, and their lives seem to be very comfortable. When I left the shipyard, I saw several Japanese prisoners leisurely sitting by the dock, fishing!</p>
<p>After the visit, following the Xiaoyuan Road, we stepped onto a small ferry, looking up at the bronze statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the long stele of the "East River Martyrs' Memorial Field," personally inscribed by President Chiang, standing majestically on the riverbank, as imposing as ever. For decades, the revolutionary holy land painstakingly managed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang has also been restored to its former glory with the victory of the War of Resistance. Recalling the past achievements, how should we carry forward the glory of Huangpu and how should we build this deep and wide Huangpu harbor! (January 14th)</p>

<h3>The Method of Selling at Low Prices Should Be Rectified</h3>
<p>Editor: We, the small citizens of Shanghai, have suffered from the oppression of eight years of life. With victory, everyone wants to breathe a sigh of relief, but before we could breathe, even heavier pressure came. For example, recently the newspapers have been continuously publishing news and notices of sales at low prices, including all daily necessities, such as cloth, flour, sugar, oil, meat, fish, eggs... and the quantities are quite large, so the small citizens thought they could breathe a sigh of relief. But the reality is by no means as wonderful as the "news." After returning from several failed attempts to join the "long snake lines," I read the various reports about the low-price sales in the newspapers and summarized them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The sales time is inaccurate, and the people in charge deliberately "drag their feet."</p>
<p>(2) The limited amount of goods for sale does not match the announcement. The regulation is three jin of edible oil per household, but some households are limited to only half a jin.</p>
<p>(3) The quantity of goods sold is far less than the "notice" stated, which is obviously being secretly swallowed by the stores in charge.</p>
<p>(4) The order is chaotic, and scalpers abound.</p>
<p>(5) Some people can openly buy without queuing, and the quantity is even larger.</p>
<p>In short, if this continues, the small citizens will definitely not benefit. I urge the authorities to seriously consider and find ways to improve the situation. If the authorities intend to hold such sales regularly, they can utilize the newly established Baojia organization, refer to the quantitative distribution system, and improve it to bring it onto the right track, so that it does not become as chaotic, disorganized, and unplanned as it is now. If the authorities are only trying to meet the current needs, they should also strengthen supervision so that the stores in charge cannot "engulf" the goods, and the scalpers cannot "operate," so that the genuine small citizens can finally breathe a sigh of relief!

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Today, Do Not Disappoint the People!</h3>
<p>Today should be the day of the closing of the Political Consultative Conference. Two weeks of grand discussions and endless debates, extended by three days, have now come to an end. The people of the whole country are eagerly awaiting the good news of an agreement. However, according to Chongqing's daily telegrams, the conference is either in a "delicate stage" or "it is still doubtful whether the task can be completed." Thirty-eight party leaders, social elites, spent seventeen days racking their brains, thinking hard, working day and night. If today they still cannot come up with a reasonable and legal concrete way to end the country's internal strife and open up the foundation of civil rule, how will they be able to face the people? Every member of the Political Consultative Conference claims to represent the people, but I wonder how many truly understand the true will of the people! Let's be honest, what the people expect today is still simple and clear, nothing more than "returning the army to the state and returning the government to the people," eight big characters. Any other flowery words are trivial matters. The members should ask themselves, in these seventeen days of numerous arguments, have they discussed a solution for these eight big characters? If the consultation does not lead to a decision, or the decision is not implemented, or the implementation is not thorough, or the implementation is not thorough and there is no punishment, then these seventeen days of consultation, whether in the plenary session or in the group sessions, will still end up with "consulting" but not "agreeing," which would be a waste of effort. The people's disappointment with national affairs will be no greater than this. But today, the overall situation of the country cannot disappoint the people again. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference can only succeed and cannot fail.</p>
<p>However, the situation of the conference is still not optimistic in its "delicate" state. Why? The main reason is that some of the high officials participating in the conference are sincere, while others may not be! We hope that this statement is wrong, but we are also deeply worried that even if this statement is not accurate, it is not far off. Let's put it bluntly, if everyone does not have the sincerity to serve the country and the people, then consultation is superfluous. Why can't we see all parties showing their sincerity today? Let's take a look: What exactly have they been discussing for these ten days?</p>
<p>The military group was originally supposed to discuss a way to return the army to the state, but although the Military Mediation Execution Department has begun its work, and the order to cease the conflict has been issued for more than ten days, there are still contacts in various places. This has already left a bad impression on the people. In addition, the reorganization of the Communist army was already agreed upon to be carried out by another three-person group, but at present, the Communist Party wants to mix it up with the reorganization of the national army to delay the process. The Communist Party has forgotten the "Double Tenth Agreement" during this consultation, weakening the power of the three-person military group, and even saying that the Communist army will accept government orders only after the implementation of constitutionalism. No wonder the local conflicts are still intermittent. As for how much sincerity they have in "returning the army to the state," everyone will know.</p>
<p>We still do not know what the government organization group has agreed upon, but they say that the Communist Party insists that all parties participate in the central government and local governments, ostensibly to "unite to the end," but in essence to "divide to the end." It is really hard to know what they are thinking about the people. The people have no other requirements for the political system, except to transition from political tutelage to constitutionalism in stability, and for the Kuomintang to return the government to the people in accordance with the law. They do not want to see everyone muddling the waters, using the name of "coalition government" to actually divide the government. However, according to the Communist Party's proposal, their region, under the sweet-sounding smokescreen of "popular election" and "liberation," does not allow anyone to interfere, while the central government and other provincial and municipal local governments must be shared by the Communist Party and all parties. In other words, their wishful thinking is "My place is only mine, but your place also has mine." Whether it is fair or not, let's not discuss it for now. We only ask: If we must unite to the end and divide to the end, does it conform to returning the government to the people? We, the people, only know that the government is whole, and the whole belongs to the people. Whoever the people trust, they will elect to represent them. Whichever party the people trust, they will elect to represent them. But today, the Communist Party is self-bragging and boasting about its three-thirds system, saying that the Communist Party's elected officials in his region are limited to one-third (truth or falsehood, God knows!). Therefore, they say that the Kuomintang cannot exceed one-third in all departments. We would like to ask again, if the people all believe in the Communist Party and elect the Communist Party, why can the Communist Party limit them to only elect one-third? Is this politeness democratic or undemocratic? Conversely, if the people in a certain place still do not consider the Kuomintang unworthy and elect more members of the Kuomintang, who can limit them and deprive them of their rights? Please understand that the Chinese people are still learning democracy and practicing elections. Don't let your imagination run wild and fabricate terms (such as the three-thirds system) to confuse their minds! If this continues, China will suffer from the loss of being named "united" but actually "divided," and will never properly embark on the road of democratic politics, and the Kuomintang's original intention of "returning the government to the people" may therefore change its nature and become dividing the government among various parties. We only ask the Kuomintang to sincerely return the government to the people, not to go down the wrong path, and let the people suffer again from the common oppression of various parties.</p>
<p>In short, the goal we require is simple: the army should belong to the state; the government should be returned to the people; the political program should be simple and clear and in line with national conditions; the draft constitution should be based on the spirit of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution and should not deviate from it; the National Assembly must be convened on May 5th as scheduled, the original representatives are legally valid, but they can be supplemented and inclusive. The members of the Political Consultative Conference must be able to deliver a reasonable and justified account of these major events before the closing of the conference, so that the people will not be disappointed again!</p>

<h3>Military Ammunition Train Explosion Near Zhenru - Beijing-Shanghai Train Service Resumed Yesterday Morning - Passengers Arrive Safely at Nanxiang Station</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The No. 502 mixed freight train, departing from the North Station the night before and bound for Nanjing, consisted of twenty fourth-class passenger cars, fourteen coal cars, three ammunition cars belonging to the General Directorate of the Ordnance Depot of the X War Zone, and lastly, the conductor's car. It was originally scheduled to depart at 5:30 PM, but due to delays in the handover of the train, it only left the North Station at 7:35 PM. Unexpectedly, twenty minutes into the journey, fifteen kilometers from Zhenru Station, the first ammunition car suddenly caught fire.</p>
<p>**Ammunition Explodes - Red Light Illuminates the Sky**</p>
<p>Upon discovering the fire, the conductor Zhou Taosheng urgently turned the steam valve open and brought the train to a complete stop. He then bravely dismounted and detached the seven cars in front of the ammunition car. He immediately ordered the military driver to quickly drive the twenty passenger cars and seven coal cars to Nanxiang. This swift action took only five minutes. By this time, the ammunition had caught fire and was exploding continuously, illuminating the sky with flames. Conductor Zhou then detoured to a nearby communication station and urgently telegraphed the Shanghai North Main Station to report the incident. The lives of the twenty passengers were thus saved.</p>
<p>**Repairs Conducted Overnight - Train Service Resumed**</p>
<p>Upon receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Station immediately dispatched dozens of people in two special trains to the scene of the accident, including the Director of the Military Affairs Department, Hou Huohua, the Deputy Director of the Public Works Department, Xu Chengkuang, the Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Transport Section, Ouyang Zhi, advisor Li Weichen, and rescue and repair workers. At that time, the explosions had not ceased, and bullets were flying in all directions. They were forced to wait until 11:00 PM when the fire had subsided slightly, before all personnel began repair work. First, they reconnected the telephone and telegraph lines along the line and towed the exploded cars and coal cars to Yangqi Station. At the same time, they dispatched personnel to Nanxiang, ordering the No. 502 train engine stationed there to be refilled with water, re-fired, and continue its journey. The entire repair work took four hours. As of 8:00 AM yesterday morning, train service had returned to normal.</p>
<p>**Soldiers Jump from Train - Four Injured**</p>
<p>The ammunition loaded in the train consisted mostly of bullets, hand grenades, and other explosive materials. It was guarded by six armed soldiers. During the explosion, the escorting soldiers jumped from the train, with four of them injured. One was seriously injured, while the other three sustained minor skin injuries and were not in serious condition.</p>
<p>**Cause of the Accident - Under Investigation**</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to Ouyang Zhi, the Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Transport Section, who spoke to a reporter from this newspaper, fortunately, the conductor was alert and acted quickly, ensuring that no passengers were killed or injured in this unfortunate incident. The railway bureau will commend him for his actions. Last night (the 24th), I was ordered to go to the scene of the accident to oversee the situation. I saw that within 30 meters of the explosion, the ground was covered with bullet marks and shrapnel. The roadbed was only damaged to the extent of a dozen or so sleepers. The three covered freight cars carrying the ammunition were severely damaged, while the two coal cars next to them sustained minor damage. The rest were unharmed. When the explosion occurred, nearby residents were alarmed, but they were reassured by the road protection team and quickly calmed down. The cause of the accident is being investigated by military police, who have taken the three soldiers escorting the train to Shanghai for questioning. As for our bureau, we had carefully considered the order of the cars before the incident, placing the twenty passenger cars behind the engine, followed by the fourteen coal cars, and finally the ammunition cars, to prevent sparks from the engine from falling onto the ammunition.</p>
<p>**Notice Posted at the Entrance of the North Station**</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the train explosion the night before, the overnight express train to Beijing that was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai, and the fourth-class slow train at 1:00 AM yesterday, both departed at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. At the same time, the express train from Beijing to Shanghai, which had been blocked at Huangdu, arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM sharp. Tong Shida, the director of the Shanghai North Main Station, posted an emergency notice at the entrance of the North Station, stating: "It has been found that the No. 502 mixed freight train departing from Shanghai North Station yesterday (January 24th) at 7:50 PM, while traveling 15 kilometers from Zhenru Station, experienced an explosion in one of the freight cars due to the carelessness of the guard overseeing the straw. The conductor took emergency and courageous action to detach the car, and all passengers safely arrived at Nanxiang Station without any casualties. Subsequently, senior employees from relevant departments of this railway personally rushed to the scene of the accident overnight to conduct repairs, which were fully completed and resumed normal train service at 8:00 AM this morning (January 25th). This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Transfer of Japanese Naval Prisoners of War Today</h3>

<h3>Municipal Museum Discovers Existing Cultural Relics</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Museum Resumption Office, it has been actively pursuing existing cultural relics. These existing cultural relics were deposited at Aurora University before the war. They were stolen by traitors and puppets in 1943. After the Education Bureau dispatched personnel to cooperate with the Police Bureau in their efforts to pursue and search for them, they were discovered in a warehouse at the former site of the Pseudo-Cultural Relics Handling Committee on Bailinan Road. The inventory has now been completed, and the museum is currently organizing them.</p>
<h3>Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court Hears Five Traitor Cases Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court heard five more cases of traitors yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>He Musheng, 40 years old, from Minhang, served as a secret agent for the enemy's Sijing Gendarmerie, committing many evils, including extorting the people and arresting our guerrillas. However, the defendant vehemently denied the charges in court yesterday, and the court ordered a further hearing at a later date.</p>
<p>Zhu Bingrong, 27 years old, from Yangzhou, and his wife, who is still at large, both served as intelligence officers in the enemy's Naval Landing Force. He arrested Yang Hengchang and two others, accusing them of being members of the Big Sword Society, and extorted their families. Yesterday, the victim's family member, Yang Hong, as well as Li Shi, Han Wang, and witness Ma Qinglin, testified in court. The defendant still tried to deny the charges, and the court ordered a further hearing at a later date.</p>
<p>Cao Yaoting, a graduate of a law and political science college, served as a temporary clerk in the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court before the war. Later, he willingly defected to the enemy and led the enemy puppets to take over the local court on November 8, 1940. Cao was then promoted to prosecutor of the puppet court. Those who were unwilling to defect were tied up and threatened at "76," a notorious puppet security organization. During his tenure, he specialized in extortion. He was dismissed and wanted by the puppet Ministry of Justice and Administration, but was never apprehended due to the protection of Li Shiqun, the head of "76." After the victory, he was arrested by our Changju branch and transferred to the court. Yesterday, the defendant denied all charges in court, falsely claiming to be an underground worker who rescued supplies and transported youths to the interior. The court ordered a further hearing after investigation.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the collegiate panel continued to hear the cases of Fang Zude and Wang Shiliang. Fang was a driver for the enemy's Wusong Gendarmerie, and Wang was a secret agent for the enemy's Gendarmerie, who had framed our underground worker Xu Zhong. The court ordered that the sentences be announced on the afternoon of the 31st.</p>

<h3>Enemy Army Captain Okada Ryuhei Captured</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the U.S. military headquarters, together with our authorities, went to the Japanese prisoner of war concentration camp in the Jiangwan Fushimajima official residence and arrested enemy army captain Okada Ryuhei, who is currently in the camp. It is reported that Okada is a major war criminal listed on the U.S. blacklist. He was involved in intelligence work and was transferred to Shanghai in February last year to work in the enemy's 13th Army Staff Headquarters stationed in Shanghai. The U.S. had been investigating and arresting him for a long time. It was previously rumored that he had returned to Tokyo, but the U.S. search in Tokyo was unsuccessful. Later, it was rumored that he was in Nanjing and Hankou, but he was not found. It was not until the day before yesterday that it was learned that he was indeed in the Shanghai concentration camp. Yesterday, they cooperated with our side to capture Okada and transferred him to the U.S. military court for prosecution.</p>

<h3>Two Special Trains Daily for Returning Home for the New Year</h3>
<p>In view of the approaching Lunar New Year and the increased number of passengers returning home for the New Year, the authorities of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways have adopted emergency transportation measures. These passengers are mostly people returning to northern Jiangsu and various places in Hangzhou, Fuyang, and Ningbo. The existing vehicles are unable to cope with the demand. From the 27th to the 31st of this month (i.e., from the 25th to the 29th of the Lunar month), two special fourth-class trains will be temporarily added for people returning home for the New Year. One train will be specially opened to Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing, selling tickets east of Danyang, specifically to facilitate passengers returning to northern Jiangsu, Huaiyang, and various places in Beijing, Anhui. One train will be specially opened to Hangzhou, specifically to facilitate passengers returning to Hangzhou and transferring to various places in Zhejiang. These special trains will each run once a day. The fare to Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing is uniformly 500 yuan in national currency. Ticket sales begin at 7:00 PM every day at the entrance to the left of the Songhu Line ticket office. The fare to Hangzhou is 380 yuan. Ticket sales begin at 9:00 AM at the West Station. Passengers can board the train immediately after purchasing tickets, and the train will depart when it is full. However, porters are not allowed to board the train, so each passenger is limited to one hand-carried bag.</p>
<p>**First Batch of Super-type Locomotives Arriving Soon**</p>
<p>In order to expedite the restoration of transportation facilities, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has shipped a large amount of transportation equipment from the United States. The first batch, consisting of more than ten American super-type locomotives, is expected to arrive within two weeks and may be unloaded here. However, the allocation of the locomotives will be decided by the Ministry of Transportation's Railroad Administration. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways may utilize half of them to expedite the improvement of transportation in the Beijing-Shanghai region. As for the original locomotives that have been repaired, more than 30 have been completed and have been fully allocated to the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Puxu sections of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The Puxu section's express train has also resumed service as a result.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Factories Affiliated with the China Textile Corporation Resuming Work This Morning - Labor Disputes in Commercial Publishing and Barber Shops Resolved</h3>
<p>In recent weeks, labor disputes in Shanghai have been surging. Factories and stores have been striking or engaging in slowdowns due to demands for adjusted wages and the issuance of year-end bonuses. Currently, after much mediation, the seventeen factories affiliated with the China Textile Corporation, including Rihua, Neiwei Cotton, etc., reached a satisfactory resolution yesterday afternoon through the mediation of Lu Jingshi, a special commissioner from the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Li Jianhua, the director of the Third Office of the Social Affairs Bureau, who convened both labor and management at the Social Affairs Bureau.

Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau invited management representative Li Bojia and labor representative Chen Yunzhong to mediate. It was decided that wages would be adjusted after Wang Yunwu returns to Shanghai. The management would first lend each person 20,000 yuan, which would be returned after the wages were adjusted. The Rong side was satisfied and scheduled to resume work this morning.</p>
<p>**Barber Shop Workers Resuming Work This Morning**</p>

<p>**Eight Major Department Stores Continue Slowdown Yesterday**</p>
<p>Yong'an, Xianshi, Xinxin, Daxin, and the other eight major department stores continued their slowdown all day yesterday. Labor and management were unable to fully reach an agreement. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau proposed that employee salaries be paid at the rate of 30,000 yuan per month as assessed by the review committee, with meals at their own expense. The management generally accepted this in principle. According to unofficial statements from the labor side, their minimum concession is that in addition to the monthly salary of 30,000 yuan, they must also be subsidized with 7,500 yuan for meals. Yesterday, all the department stores remained open but did not sell goods.</p>
<p>**Mediation Unsuccessful for Ewo Factory Workers**</p>
<p>More than 10,000 workers at the British Ewo cotton mill are demanding immediate resumption of work and the payment of victory bonuses and severance pay. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated three times without result. Thousands of workers marched in front of the Ewo foreign firm on the Bund yesterday.</p>
<p>**Other Factories Still Fluctuate**</p>
<p>The strike at Shenxin No. 6 Factory and Chongxin Cotton Mill has been resolved, and work has resumed. The Guangqin Cotton Mill is still in a stalemate. Yesterday, the Tongyi Cotton Mill went on strike in protest over year-end bonuses. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated the labor dispute at the Power Company, but no satisfactory result was achieved.</p>

<p>More than 2,000 Chinese drivers, coppersmiths, and laborers at the U.S. military headquarters' transportation office in Shanghai went on strike to demand improved treatment. The management authorities set a deadline for reporting back to work and promised to increase the salary of those with a minimum wage of 600 yuan per day by 100 yuan, and so on for those above 600 yuan. Work resumed yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>China Silk Company: Avoiding Competition with the People, Taking Over Silk Factories to Resume Production</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) According to Mr. Ge Jingzhong, the General Manager of the China Silk Company, told reporters that the company's current business plan is to promote the two major principles of assisting private enterprises and improving research. Regarding the principle of assisting private enterprises, in terms of technology, the company will recruit technical personnel and use scientific methods to guide and improve private silk businesses. Economically, the company will try its best to help private silk businesses that accept guidance to obtain low-interest loans from national banks. In terms of the principle of improvement and research, the company plans to set up demonstration nurseries, demonstration breeding grounds, and demonstration silk factories. Research departments will be set up in these basic business institutions to introduce research results to private nurseries, breeding grounds, and silk factories. Therefore, future work will focus on the cultivation and development of basic businesses within the scope of avoiding competition with the people as much as possible. Mr. Ge also said that in the past, China's silk competitors in the world market were only Japan. China's silk production has advantages in terms of weather, geography, and labor. All conditions are far superior to Japan. The difference is the lack of application of scientific methods, which has led to a daily increase in production costs. Therefore, if we carefully study and reduce costs in the future, it will not be difficult for China to gain an advantage in the world silk market. The company has recently decided to send personnel to Taiwan to breed spring silkworms for the 35th year, using the original mulberry varieties in Taiwan to raise silkworms. It is understood that China's silkworm seeds can be self-sufficient. All personnel going to Taiwan are ready and will set sail south as soon as they receive a reply from the Taiwan Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Groups Declaration: Defending Shipping Rights</h3>
<p>Various shipping-related organizations in Shanghai, in view of the painful past of losing shipping rights, the difficulty of recovering shipping rights, and the current crisis of wavering shipping rights, held an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Shipping Club at No. 93 Guangdong Road. They unanimously resolved the following:</p>
<p>Resolved Key Issues</p>
<p>(1) Issue a joint declaration to defend shipping rights. (2) Send a telegram to the government, urging it to earnestly protect the integrity of territorial waters and shipping rights based on the new treaty, and to prohibit ships flying foreign flags from engaging in domestic river and coastal trade. (3) If ships flying foreign flags navigate domestic rivers or coastal areas, infringing on China's shipping rights, Chinese seamen, dockworkers, and all other employees related to the shipping industry will absolutely not cooperate with them. (4) Send a telegram to the government requesting it to follow the precedents of various countries and quickly compensate 300,000 tons of private ships sacrificed in this war to restore the original transportation capacity. (5) Send a telegram to the government requesting it to quickly repair existing ships and other shipping equipment, and to fully utilize the allocation of ships nationwide, matching ship performance with waterways, and taking into account both military and civilian transportation. (6) Send a telegram to the government ordering the customs authorities to restore navigation markers in the Yangtze River and coastal areas as soon as possible, and requesting the naval authorities to quickly clear mines to restore night navigation and increase transportation capacity.</p>
<p>Joint Declaration</p>
<p>Briefly stated: Now that the War of Resistance has been won and unequal treaties have been abolished, we suddenly hear that foreign merchants are using the transportation of materials from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration as an excuse to demand that ships flying foreign flags operate in our inland rivers and coastal areas. Our shipping-related organizations hereby solemnly declare to China and foreign countries with a sincere and firm attitude that we will resist any action or attempt to infringe upon our inland river and coastal shipping rights with the spirit of bloody resistance and arduous struggle over the past eight years. Finally, at this epoch-making stage in the history of China's shipping industry, we sincerely hope that our government will consider the heavy sacrifices made by private shipping companies for the country over the past eight years, the difficulty of the revival of the national shipping industry, and the urgent measures such as advance compensation for requisitioned ships, the maximum utilization of existing ships, the full supply of ship fuel, the rapid establishment of navigation markers, practical assistance in shipping construction, and comprehensive planning for both military and civilian transportation, especially the preservation of river and sea shipping rights. We also hope that our friendly countries, especially the United States, which has helped us the most, will transfer a portion of their large surplus of ships to our country under reasonable economic conditions so that we can achieve the revival of the shipping industry and the magnificence of shipping rights as soon as possible. The Chinese shipping industry and even the Chinese nation will always be grateful for this kind of genuine friendship. In addition to sending telegrams to the government and the competent authorities, we hereby declare this.</p>

<h3>Tight Credit at the End of the Lunar Year: Gold and Paper Money Decline Across the Board, Many New Hong Kong Dollar Notes Being Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai dollar depreciated because of the slight decline in the Chongqing market and the unusually tight overnight positions. Major players had no intention of participating, so the market trend was extremely weak. The market opened slightly lower in the morning, and continued to be supplied by US dollar arbitrage sellers after the opening. It fell from 9.16 million to below the 9 million level. However, at this time, there were more bargain hunters, and the market fluctuated around the 9 million level for a long time. But in the end, due to the lack of stimulus at the end of the year, it could not sustain and fell again near noon, falling below 8.9 million. The morning session closed at 8.92 million, down 24,000 from the previous close. Transactions were sparse in the afternoon, and the spot price did not deviate much from the morning close. Overnight transactions opened slightly stable, but the industry and outsiders were uninterested, and there was little change in the end. Futures also fell by 24,000. Gold jewelry in jewelry stores was 96,000, silver taels were 800 yuan, and silver dollars rose to 490 yuan due to Japan's increase in silver prices. Dark interest rates for daily loans ranged from 10% to 12%, and 14% for loans over the New Year.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars lacked special stimulus, and inflows and outflows were scattered. The Chongqing market reported a slight decline, and the market opened slightly lower at 1,463 yuan in the morning. Sellers followed one after another, and arbitrage trading was also a small amount of activity. By noon, the market had retreated to 1,442 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to fluctuate within 1,450 yuan, which was unusually mediocre. As a result, it fell by 21 yuan. Hong Kong dollar notes softened slightly yesterday. Cotton settlement and overseas remittances stopped slightly. Old notes fell back by 5 yuan. New notes collapsed due to speculative forces, and there were still many sellers, continuing to fall by 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculative Sentiment Wanes: Stock Prices Repeatedly Hit Lows</h3>
<p>The Shanghai stock market felt surrounded by enemies on all sides. Major players were willing but unable to act. Many people realized that if they did not advance, they would retreat, and continued to unwind positions. The supply of shares suddenly loosened, and each stock fell step by step. Although there were struggles along the way, they did not help the overall situation. The morning session closed with lower prices across the board. The downward trend was still weak. The morning close resulted in Yong Yarn falling by 170 yuan, Mei Ya falling by 110 yuan, Xin He falling by 50 yuan, and Jingfu and other three small popular stocks falling by about 10% each. Each unpopular stock also fell slightly.</p>
<p>Although small and medium-sized foreign stocks fell, they did not fall much. Large-cap and rubber stocks were less strong. This was due to the tight credit situation, which put pressure on the bottom line. Speculative sentiment in the Shanghai stock market has subsided. Foreign stocks seem unlikely to escape this trend. However, foreign stocks have fixed closing times, unlike the Shanghai stock market, which has no clear rules. Although weak, the process was still relatively smooth. As a result, except for Yi Beer, each stock softened slightly. Jardine Matheson fell by 1,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Retail Investors Suffer Enough: Government Bonds Fall Step by Step</h3>
<p>Many parties did not dare to hold onto government bonds. Due to the end of the year, credit was extremely tight. The bond market had no support from major players. A certain firm previously bought a large number of Sichuan Bank's Class C bonds, with the intention of selling them at a good price. However, the counterparties had difficulties, and it was not easy to sell. There were several attempts to sell and then stop. By noon, they had no choice but to painfully cut losses. Class C bonds gradually broke through four major levels from 1,630 yuan, reaching a low of 1,290 yuan. The morning close was only maintained by major players in the industry, returning to above 1,300. The results were down 110 yuan for Class A and B, 240 yuan for Class C, 120 yuan for Class D, and 130 yuan for Class E. The general psychology gradually broke down on the various lavish expectations that had been spread before, and another group of retail investors suffered.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Remains Short of Supply</h3>
<p>The yarn market remained firm yesterday. Customer sales were unusually active. Weaving factories were willing to purchase. The price of each type of yarn rose again by 20,000. Sixteen-count Guangming yarn was bought and sold by many, with the price closing from 445,000 yuan to 470,000 yuan. Fangjian Company continued to supply, but it was gradually becoming short of supply. People's minds are optimistic, and the trend remains strong.</p>
<h3>Tight Cotton Prices: Sparse Cotton Cloth Transactions</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions were less active. Only the Zhongfang Spinning Mill purchased 42-count raw American cotton middling at a price of 62,000 yuan, which was the price delivered to the factory. In addition, the Hua Hao purchased 16-count raw cotton Huo Ji at prices of 42,000 yuan and 44,000 yuan. Seed cotton was quoted at 8,200 yuan and 8,300 yuan. The above prices were all for delivery at the warehouse. Prices were tighter than the previous day.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, those who held goods with real strength were unwilling to sell them again, because it was still impossible to predict what the spring market would look like. Conversely, those whose funds were overdrawn from banks were now in the period of major settlement and were also ending their transactions. Therefore, the volume of transactions was unusually low.</p>
<h3>Weak Silk Market: Silk Fabrics and Loans Are Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first transaction price of 120-day Tianjin artificial silk was 1.12 million yuan, followed by an increase of 20,000 yuan. The afternoon price was 1.13 million yuan. Very few transactions were made. The warehouse receipt was sold for 720,000 yuan in the morning and quoted at 730,000 yuan in the afternoon, a difference of 400,000 yuan from the spot price. The reason was that there were rumors that customs duties would have to be paid for the goods to be delivered in the future, so the price of the warehouse receipt could not be improved. The factory price was also quoted lower yesterday, but those who held the goods refused to sell, and there were virtually no transactions. Silk fabrics were mostly switched to cotton fabrics due to the high shipping costs and taxes for customer shipments, so demand was stagnant. Yesterday morning, brokers in the market were dissatisfied with direct transactions between their peers and started arguing, and everyone dispersed in a huff. There were no transactions for any goods. Transactions outside the market were priced similarly to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Rationing: Payment on Monday</h3>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The authorities have completed the investigation procedures for the rationing of artificial silk raw materials to silk weaving factories. The industry association held a meeting yesterday and decided that each weaving machine can be rationed about half a box of artificial silk. Payment will be made on Monday the 28th, and one-quarter of the goods will be delivered first. It is said that the price is about 10% lower than the market price.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>The rice market continued to digest slowly and retreated further. Northern japonica rice continued to weaken by 200-300 yuan, southern japonica rice weakened by another 300-400 yuan, glutinous rice weakened secretly by 400-500 yuan, and indica rice also followed down by 300-400 yuan. At the noon close, merchants showed slight interest, and the situation stabilized. Yellow soybeans were flat to weak, soybean cakes were weak to stable, flour gradually declined, down another hundred yuan or so, raw peanuts were nominally stable but secretly weak, and the liquor market was stable.</p>
<h3>Weak White Coal Blocks: Firewood and Charcoal Retail Sales Are Quite Strong</h3>
<p>Coal market transactions turned dull, and the trend was generally stable. White coal screened lumps remained weak. Small-sized coal was still in short supply, and the market was the most popular. The rising trend of bituminous coal blocks gradually subsided, but sales continued. The firewood market was mixed, and arrivals continued from all directions, especially charcoal arrivals were the most abundant. Steel charcoal, screened charcoal, and pine firewood retail sales were quite strong, and prices remained stable. Poor-quality rush mat charcoal had to be selected and screened by the industry before it could be sold, and prices continued to fall.</p>
<h3>The North-South Dried Goods Market Trend Stabilizes</h3>
<p>As the end of the major settlement period approached, most owners of North-South dried goods were unwilling to sell them again, so prices were higher, and the market trend was tight. Currently, only sporadic transactions are being made. Large-sized fragrant cinnamon bark from Xiangzhuang was offered at 38,700 yuan, while small and medium-sized grains were less than 30,000 yuan. Longan meat was as high as 90,000 yuan, and the next grade was 35,000 yuan. Jinshan longan branches were 92,000 yuan, large-bubble jujubes from Zhuangzhuang were 38,000 yuan, and the next grade was 36,000-37,000 yuan. Diaoqing sugar was 33,000 yuan, and red rice of the upper and middle grades from Zhuangzhuang was 35,000 yuan. The market trend was generally stable.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Sales Are the Strongest</h3>
<p>Recently, as the Lunar New Year approaches, the transaction of red and green tea in this city has become increasingly prosperous, and sales have become more and more active. Buyers are searching more vigorously, and people's minds are also extremely excited. The trend is fully revealed, and green tea is particularly popular among them, so high prices have appeared one after another, and the market for red tea is tight and stable.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Newspapers to Arrive: New Dodge Trucks to Enter the Market</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) According to sources in the foreign firms in this city, a large batch of rolled newspaper paper will arrive in Shanghai successively starting next month. By June of this year, it is expected to be sufficient to meet the needs of this city. Also, 1946 Dodge WF trucks will enter the market in large quantities before the end of April.

<h3>Group A Football League: Exciting Showdown Today - Donghua Faces the Italian Overseas Team at 2:30 PM in Jiaozhou Park</h3>
<p>Today's football league features an exciting Group A match between Donghua and the Italian Overseas team. These two major teams, one Chinese and one Western, are evenly matched and will provide an exciting game. The match will be held at Jiaozhou Park starting at 2:30 PM. Tickets are priced at 500 and 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Donghua and the Italian Overseas team have historically been considered two major rivals, one Chinese and one foreign, in the Shanghai football scene. Their matches always draw large crowds. Currently, Donghua is improving, further bolstered by the addition of four new players. Central defender Qian Shang has a fresh new look. Conversely, the Italian Overseas team has struggled to maintain stability due to lifestyle issues, and their training ground has been neglected for a long time, resulting in a decline in recent form. Therefore, Donghua's victory today will likely be less difficult than in the past. Ottone, the backbone of the Italian Overseas team, is the soul of the team. His recent departure to the north has further disrupted the team's coordination. It is reported that Sirati will take over as central defender, but this weakens the defense even further. Today's schedule is as follows: Donghua vs. Italian Overseas (Group A) 2:30 PM, Jiaozhou Park; Haihua vs. Wanguo (Group C1) 3:00 PM, Zhongyi; Bote vs. Lianxing (Group C2) 3:00 PM, Zhonger; Jianguang vs. Nie Zhongcheng (Group C1) 3:00 PM, Zhongsan.</p>
<p>Donghua Team: Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Linggen, Song Lingsheng, Xin Fuzhen, Han Longbo, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linhui, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang.</p>
<p>In case of rain today, please call 36701 or 38683 for inquiries.</p>

<h3>The Mask of "Politeness" and "Humility"</h3>
<p>— Yu Ti</p>
<p>China is a land of propriety, a fact universally acknowledged. Therefore, all actions revolve around the concept of "propriety" as a starting point. In the minds of most people, "propriety" equates to politeness. Thus, you are polite, I am polite, everyone is polite.</p>
<p>Rushing to pay at restaurants, scrambling to buy tickets at theaters, fighting to pay taxi fares, even vying to purchase tram tickets... everyone is rushing and fighting, turning this land of propriety into a nation filled with hypocrisy. Is this kind of politeness propriety or impropriety? Everyone should search their own conscience.</p>
<p>Open your eyes and look at those with blonde hair and blue eyes. Do they engage in such foolishness? In principle, I am eating the food, so I should pay the price. I am enjoying the show, so I should pay. I am using the transportation, so I should pay... for everything I personally enjoy, I should pay. There is no such thing as "enjoying rights without fulfilling obligations." —Except perhaps in China.</p>
<p>Does this mean they lack "propriety" (politeness)? No, they are polite. You see them adhering to the principle of "women first" when boarding ships and disembarking from vehicles (an action that can be done by our fellow countrymen, but is rare). In train carriages, you see strong young people giving their seats to the elderly and frail... most notably, they are extremely polite to customers. When you finish buying something, they will say "Thank you," and even if you don't buy anything, they will still thank you. If it were a Chinese person, and you asked the price of this and that, they would impatiently roll their eyes at you. Why is this?</p>
<p>Now, let's shift the focus and talk about Chinese "humility."</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, China is a land of propriety, so it inevitably possesses the virtue (?) of "humility." Opening your mouth, you say, "My abilities are weak, I cannot bear this important task..." Closing your mouth, you say, "My talents and learning are shallow..." a continuous stream of empty words. But the more humble a person is, the more society values and respects them. If you tell the truth, "I am qualified to handle this matter," before you can finish speaking, everyone around you will unanimously accuse you of being "arrogant" and "looking down on everything."...</p>
<p>If your superiors appoint you to handle a matter, or the public elects you to serve the country, you will submit resignation letters, one after another, stating "...my abilities are shallow... I fear I will fail to meet expectations..." In reality, you desire the position more than anything, but on the surface, you pretend to "retreat three times" and "feign ignorance."</p>
<p>In this new era, a new attitude should emerge. Those wearing the masks of "politeness and humility" should abandon them, because now is an era that demands "seeking truth from facts, and resolutely avoiding hypocritical slogans!"</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>The Annoyance of Borrowing Books</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Since I was young, I have cherished things, unlike other children who like to destroy and discard things. I have always enjoyed tidying and preserving things. This is also due to the influence of my family environment, as my family members are mostly fond of cleanliness. Especially for books, the "Three Character Classic" and "Hundred Family Surnames" that I read when I was first learning to read have not a single torn page, and are still well-preserved to this day. As I grew older, my fondness for cleanliness deepened. A book could be read for two years without a single ink stain or a single dog-eared page. A dictionary could be used for over twenty years, and apart from being slightly old, it would still be intact, without a single broken or loose page. The magazines and newspapers I read were even more flat and clean, no different from the new books displayed in bookstores.</p>
<p>This is because I have a habit when reading: I never arbitrarily bend or force things. When turning pages, I don't use my middle and index fingers to clamp the pages, or use my thumbnails to lift the corners. Instead, I gently turn the pages with my thumbs. At the same time, I keep my hands and desk clean, so there are absolutely no oil stains or dirt on the books. Once I finish reading, I put the book away properly, without throwing or stuffing it anywhere.</p>
<p>But in recent years, my books can no longer maintain the cleanliness they once had. Because of changes in my environment, my books are no longer exclusive to me. Friends and relatives ask to borrow them, and I can't refuse them. I am also happy to let them read them, because I want others to gain knowledge, inspiration, and enjoyment from those books.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when the books are returned, they are completely different from when they were borrowed. They were originally flat and smooth, but now they are covered with creases and wrinkles. They were originally clean, but now they are stained with oil and dirt. Sometimes there are even watermelon seeds or sunflower seed shells stuck between the pages. Worse still, the book has fallen apart, with the cover and spine barely hanging on. Seeing this, I can't help but feel a surge of anger. But to them, unless the book itself is torn, they don't think it's a big deal at all. Even if the book is torn, they will give you an apologetic smile, blaming it on naughty children or terrible mice. Not only can you not scold them, but you also have to return their smile. Moreover, although my anger is great, my courage is small. I simply don't have the courage to scold them. Once, a colleague asked to borrow a novel. Fearing that it would end up in a "burnt and battered" state again, I told her in advance: "Don't damage the book." But she retorted sullenly: "I'm not a child. My husband is a teacher!" From then on, I dared not say another word, either before or after.</p>
<p>If the book is ruined, although I no longer have the desire to preserve it, it's no big deal if I tear it up to start a fire or sell it by the pound as waste paper. The problem is when a book borrowed from someone else is ruined, I have to take responsibility. Because of this, if possible, I often try to keep borrowed books out of sight. But I also feel that this is too selfish, hindering the spread of knowledge. At the same time, I also feel that it is my responsibility to maintain the integrity of the book.</p>
<p>So I am annoyed—a not-so-big, not-so-small annoyance. Should I change my habit of cleanliness and use reason to suppress my rising anger? When encountering a book borrowed from someone else, should I lend it to others to take advantage of the opportunity to spread knowledge, or should I not lend it to others in order to fulfill my responsibility to maintain the book's original integrity?</p>
<p>I believe that my habit of cleanliness is good and correct. If everyone had my habit, bookstore owners might frown, but library directors would rejoice. The lifespan of books in their libraries would be extended at least tenfold, which would increase the effectiveness of each book and save the library countless amounts of money, as well as the effort and materials for repairing and binding. I believe this habit is what every citizen should have. Not being fond of cleanliness is a bad habit and a disease of our people. Whether it's the individual, the family, or society, we see disorder, messiness, and chaos everywhere. This is an important reason why foreigners look down on us. I should not only not abandon my habit to conform to others, but I should also take on the responsibility of correcting others' bad habits. But how do I correct them? I don't have the courage to point fingers directly, nor do I have the eloquence to persuade them tactfully. To exchange someone's resentment for the cleanliness of a book seems to be making a mountain out of a molehill and not worth it. Because there are few people who will admit their mistakes, and even fewer who will accept your teachings and correct their habits. Then why bother doing something futile?</p>
<p>Thus, I am often disturbed by the contradictions between my habits, sense of responsibility, and fear, and I feel a not-so-big, not-so-small annoyance!</p>
<p>Short Essay</p>
<h3>Lost Warmth</h3>
<p>— Zhang Peng</p>
<p>My adopted son, Zhang Yao, came to see me on Sunday. In an unintentional observation, I noticed the pair of blue cloth shoes he was wearing, and a kind of shadow flickered in my heart, and an idea swirled in my mind. 'Could these shoes have been made by his mother for him to wear?' I was sure my guess was right, but I still asked him: 'Yao, did your mom make the new shoes you're wearing?'</p>
<p>"Yes, Mom made them for me."</p>
<p>'Yao, you have to wear them carefully, don't waste them carelessly,' How I envied him; I envied him for having a mother who made shoes for him. 'Ah! Mother, the warmth and kindness of a mother's love, how deep and how intense!' My eyes felt hot, as if tears were about to fall.</p>
<p>Thinking of the past, I also had a mother. My mother also made many cloth shoes for me to wear, but I always wore a long face, still complaining that the shoes were not made well enough; that the style didn't match the beauty I imagined. I would pout and argue with my mom: 'Mom, the shoes you made aren't good looking at all, how can I wear them out in public?'</p>
<p>'Good boy, the shoes are already made. If you want to wear nice shoes, Mom will make you another pair next time!' Mom still patiently and gently endured my anger: 'The style of these shoes isn't that bad, you can wear them for now.'</p>
<p>'No; no, I don't want to wear those embarrassing shoes!' I puffed up my cheeks and threw the shoes hard on the table, turning around and running away: 'I don't care for shoes like these, I'd rather go barefoot!'</p>
<p>Mom was a gentle and weak woman, she loved my father, and she also loved her children. At the time, seeing me so angry with tears in my eyes, she didn't get angry and scold me, but quietly used a handkerchief to wipe her eyes. I knew that Mom's heart was hurt, I knew that Mom was crying. My heart was so cruel, only wishing to be angry myself, without any love or pity for Mom's pain. I locked myself in my room like a fool, muttering to myself what I thought were very satisfying words.</p>
<p>My attitude, my angry attitude, made Mom very unhappy for several days.</p>
<p>Now I have no mother; I have become a person who has lost warmth. No one makes shoes for me to wear anymore. If I want to wear shoes, I have to buy expensive shoes to wear. Thinking of the past, and then thinking of the present, I couldn't help but quietly grieve with tears streaming down my face.</p>
<p>What makes me regret it for the rest of my life is, why didn't I keep a pair of worn-out old shoes? Not only could I keep them as a permanent memento for myself, but when I saw others wearing shoes made by their mothers, I could also take out my broken and worn shoes from when I was little to look at them and reminisce about the love and kindness my mother showed me in the past. It's hateful and regrettable that I can't even get that. Alas! Where can I find traces of the warmth that my mother left me?</p>

<h3>Theorem</h3>
<p>— Cheng Lieshui</p>
<p>Waiting for a tram is the most unpleasant thing, but when you finally catch the tram, you feel very happy.</p>
<p>Being able to squeeze on feels lucky; but once you're on, you're so crushed that you can barely breathe, and you still feel frustrated.</p>
<p>People often have this kind of psychology, and things often happen this way.</p>
<p>Adults tease children with candy. The child happily wants it, but the adult won't give it. When the child doesn't want it anymore, the adult keeps teasing.</p>
<p>As a result, the child doesn't get the candy; cries, makes a fuss, and even gets a beating.</p>
<p>Children are always like this, and adults are always like this.</p>
<p>Mice specialize in gnawing on things. When they are caught, they are released because there are no cats.</p>
<p>But the second time they gnaw again, and are caught again, but because there are still no cats, they are released again.</p>
<p>Mice are able to constantly erode things because of the safety of not having cats.</p>

<h3>Poor and Sick Young Man Suffers Unspeakable Hardship - Asks Philanthropists to Send Him to Hospital for Treatment</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Liu Sangnian, barely twenty years old, unfortunately contracted mild tuberculosis in the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). For the past three years, he has been unable to afford treatment, and his savings have been exhausted. Filled with worry and anxiety, he hates his illness and the pain of not receiving treatment. Therefore, he earnestly appeals to all charitable circles to show great kindness, providing medical relief and sending him to a hospital for free treatment to save this disaster victim. Such kindness would be akin to rebirth. After recovery, I am willing to work diligently without pay for several years to repay your great virtue. Therefore, I am writing to request your newspaper to grant me space to disclose my situation. If I am fortunate enough to receive a favorable response, please inform me by letter. With tearful voice, I eagerly await your reply! Respectfully submitted. Liu Sang bows.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Reading Mr. Liu's letter, the words are earnest and the writing and handwriting are clear and fluent. Although we have not met him, we can say with certainty that he is a promising young man. Due to his family's inability to afford medical treatment, he is willing to work voluntarily for several years after his recovery as an exchange condition, which is a novel and effective method. Therefore, we are disclosing his situation in the hope that benevolent individuals or hospital owners, moved by his talent, will provide medical assistance. The merits would be immeasurable. Please contact this newspaper if you are willing to provide medical assistance, and the good deeds will be immeasurable.</p>

<h3>Responses to Readers</h3>
<p>(I) New Invention Patent Rights</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: My friend has recently invented a very useful tool for rural irrigation and intends to apply to the authorities for a patent. I respectfully ask the following points: (1) Can the inventor obtain a patent from the government? To which agency should the application be submitted to be legal? (2) What is the longest and shortest term for a patent? (3) What are the application procedures? (4) Can an application be submitted before the National Government returns to the capital? Reader: Chen Yunian</p>
<p>(Answer) I greatly admire your talent in inventing an irrigation tool for rural construction. Regarding patent rights, you should apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Patents have a prescribed term limit. An application can be submitted before the National Government returns to the capital. You can entrust a lawyer to handle the procedures.</p>
<p>(II) What Punishment Should Traitors Receive?</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: Since the victory of the War of Resistance, many traitors and puppets have been arrested in various places, but many have also escaped justice, which is a great regret! I respectfully report to you the situation of my personal oppression by traitors: In June of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], I was bullied by the puppet company commander Zhang Ni Zicheng, who took advantage of his power to arrest me for no reason, subjecting me to cruel torture and beatings, leaving me half-dead, and my body naturally covered with wounds, making my suffering unspeakable. I was imprisoned like this for three days, tortured hundreds of times. When I regained consciousness, my mind was dazed, like a madman, and I did not know what I was saying. (Omission) Now that the light of day has returned, Zhang Ni, due to his overflowing wickedness, was arrested by the Provincial Security Team on the 6th of this month and sent to the county for legal action. May I ask if the traitor should be sentenced to death? I hope it can be published in the social service column so that I can appeal to all sectors of society. Mu Lin</p>
<p>(Answer) Since the traitor has already been sent to the county for legal action, you can collect evidence of his past treacherous acts and crimes, along with the details of your victimization, and submit them to the county for reference. There is no need to appeal to all sectors of society again. As for whether he should be sentenced to death, it depends entirely on the nature of his crimes and is not appropriate to speculate.</p>
<p>(III) Application Procedures for Scholarship Recipients</p>
<p>I have heard that your newspaper's scholarship funds have been merged into the Education Loan Committee. Must old scholarship recipients reapply to the Education Loan Committee, or will they still be handled in the same way as before? I respectfully ask for a reply. Scholarship recipient Cheng Linsun</p>
<p>(Answer) From February 1st, university and middle school students should directly collect application forms from the Education Loan Committee, while primary school students should obtain forms from the principal of their school.</p>
<p>(IV) The Authority of Various Government Agencies</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: To be sure of the authority of the various military and political agencies, in addition to managing local public security, does the Songhu Garrison Headquarters have the authority to mediate labor disputes? If there are acts of overreach, what means do citizens have to prevent them? I have always considered your newspaper to be the mouthpiece of the people, so please answer this and I wish you peace! A Citizen, January 24th</p>
<p>(Answer) Mediating labor disputes is the responsibility of the Bureau of Social Affairs; however, if there are circumstances that endanger public security, the Garrison Headquarters is responsible for maintaining local order and cannot shirk its duty. The question of "what means to prevent it" is, in my humble opinion, untenable.</p>
