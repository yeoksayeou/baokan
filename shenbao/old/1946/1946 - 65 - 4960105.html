<h3>鄒魯白崇禧王正廷等　要求改變外交作風　全會塲情緒悲憤激昂</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶五日電〕二中全會第五次大會，五日下午三時十五分舉行，出席委員二二〇人，由何委員應欽主席，開會如儀，秘書處宜讀第四次大會記錄，主席即宣吿由外交部長王世杰作外交報吿，歷一時半始畢。休息十分鐘後，繼續開會，檢討外交報吿，委員發言者，有鄒魯·白崇禧·王正廷·宋宜山。胡秋原·谷正　等。均指陳秘密外交之錯誤及外交作風之亟應改變。檢討時，會塲情緒悲憤激昂，鄒　。白崇禧。王正廷等發言時，屢爲熱烈之掌聲所中斷。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶五日電〕王部長五日下午在二中全會第五次大會中，作關於最近外交工作之口頭報吿，報告內容，涉及聯合團組織，日本的管制，中蘇友好同盟條約與柬北接收問題，越南問題以及華僑保護問題，（一）主部長於報吿聯合國組織問題時說：「現時國際局勢，呈現極度之不安，一由於聯合國間諸大國缺乏充分的協調，一由於新武器（原子彈）之出現，而聯合國現有組織之軟弱，尤爲主要原因。聯合國現有組織之軟弱，由於安全理事會中各常任理事國保有極廣泛的否決權，但國際局勢之不安，或將造成一種普遍的要求，即加强聯合國的組織，吾人對於聯合國組織之現狀，雖不能滿意，但不可不注意其未來的發展」。（二）關於日本管制問題，王部長說：「最近中。美·英·蘇所同意設立之遠東委會與四國管制委會，係就美·蘇兩政府原來之主張所採取之折衷辦法，中國政府於去年十一月間，即曾主張與此相似之折衷方案」。主部長論文日本對盟國的賠償問題時，鄭重的說：「中國抗戰最久，損失最大，故在日本對盟蘇友好同盟條約之訂立，以及東北接收交涉經過，王部長今向大會提出報吿，王部長說：「蘇軍的撤退，原定爲去年十二月三日以前，此距日本投降之日（九月二日）爲三個月，與中蘇協定中所規定蘇軍撤退之限期相合，嗣因我軍自大連登陸間題，中蘇間未獲成立協議，兼之地方不規則武力在長春，瀋　等地方威脅我接收人員，遂致接收發生頓挫·後來中蘇兩方經過兩度的商議，乃商定以本年二月一日爲蘇軍自東北微退完成之期，現在期限已過，蘇軍尙未撤退，據蘇方所表示，蘇軍撤退之延緩，係因技術上的困難，我政府現正向蘇方繼續催詢中。本年一月間蘇聯政府曾向我政府提出一個聲明謂，東北諸省曾爲關東軍服務之日本企業，應視爲蘇軍戰利品，我方則認日人在華之公私產業，均應視爲日本對華賠償之一部，已如前述，故中蘇兩方對於此一問題之見解，迄未一致。惟蘇軍之撤退，依照協定原不附帶任何條件，因之，此一爭議之存在，應不能構成蘇軍緩撤之原由。中蘇親善，誠如本黨總裁所云，不特爲中蘇兩國所需要，抑實爲全世界的和平安全所需求，本人深望雙方同本親善友好精神，使蘇軍撤退問題迅獲解次」。（四）最後，王部長就我軍自越南撤退問題詳加說明，並就中國最近與中南美諸國，暹羅以及荷蘭等國所訂保護華僑之新的，提出簡括的報吿。</p>
<h3>對財政金融經濟措施　各委員嚴格檢討　注意力集中黃金物資等項</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶五日電〕二中全會五日上午九時十五分舉行第四次大會，出席委員居正·戴傳賢·孫科·吳敬恒·張繼·宋子文·蔣宋美齡等二百三十人，孫委員科主席，開會如儀，秘書處宣續第三次會議紀錄及報吿文件後，主席宣吿繼續對於財政·金融及經濟問題報吿之檢討。發言者極爲踴躍，計口頭質詢廿一起，書面質詢二起，各委員以本黨主義及政綱·政策均極爲正確，然主管機關執行每不能令人滿意，遂使民衆對本黨頗多怨言，故咸就觀感所及，對財政·金融·經濟各項施政，作嚴格之檢討。此種勇敢負責之態度，實足表現本黨革新之精神，各委員發言後，且有提議大會不應接受經濟部之報吿及主張大會行使罷免權者，亦有提議設立「接收敵僞產業物資淸理委員會」者。前二項提議，因全會無此規定而未通過，後項提議，主席宣吿父審查會辦理，隨即宣讀（一）財政·金融·經濟問題報吿審查會名單，召集人爲劉健羣·劉　文·趙　坪·（二）大會宣言起草委員名單，召集人孫科·王世杰·陳布雷·十二時十五分散會。茲將各委員對財政·金融·經濟問題報吿商討之意見，略述如下：</p>
<p>〔　　〕經濟措施失敗之原因，　　（一）忽視民生主義，培養官　資。（二）抗戰期間統制經濟失敗。（三）民營工業　其自生自滅，不加注意。（四）重工業幾乎完全停頓。（五）對失業工人無有效救濟辦法。（六）經濟部所派接收人員頗多失　。（七）各地物資之盈虧，無調節計劃，物價高漲，無適當之措施。（八）戰後經濟政策未聞報吿計　。</p>
<p>〔　　〕生產低落，民生凋敝，通貨膨脹，物價高漲，人民深受痛苦，公敎人員及士兵生活艱難，此種情形，　以言行政效率。後方工廠倒閉，收復區接收工廠多未開工，整個經濟體系處于無政府狀態，凡措施均與民生主義　道而馳，執行政策者，實應負責，氏復解釋「官僚資本」之意義，　求官商分離，登記官史資產。</p>
<p>〔戴塊生〕　財部注意僑匯，應依照賣出外匯價格計算。</p>
<p>〔任　宣〕財經兩部之報吿，皆未能依照六全代會決議，關千民生主我政綱第四·第十兩條實施。查政綱第四條爲都市土地一律收歸公有，農地除公營者外，應以最迅速有效之方法，實行耕者有其田，凡非自耕之土地，概由國家發行土地債券，逐次徵購，並分配之。第十條爲登記並限制各級官吏及公營事業從業人員之資產，幷澈底實行各級官吏不得經營商業之規定，而行政院對此重要政綱，僅以應辦二字作爲註釋，面無實施之事實，此種官僚作風，必須改革。</p>
<p>〔魯蕩平〕請公布黃金買賣之數字。</p>
<p>〔彭昭賢〕各省財廳對于田賦稅收金融皆不能過問，無事可做，而田糧管理處之機構則過於龐大，此種制度必須改善，各省稅收機關，有全部收入且不足維持該機關之經常費者，稅收有過於苛細者，一應澈底整理，遺產稅，土地稅等無一定標準，亦應厘訂稅率。</p>
<p>〔羅時實〕（一）黃金政策，政府與人民之得失如何，（二）官營紡織公司之舉辦，是否爲解決民生主義之「衣」的問題，後來宣布官營三年後仍交由民營，是否又爲民對生主義之信念有所動搖。</p>
<p>〔劉維熾〕預算收支相差甚鉅，是否仍賴通貨膨脹，抑有其他方法彌補，外匯基金有限，必須獎勵出口貨物，利用僑匯，方能維持久遠。</p>
<p>〔吳鑄人〕經濟問題最嚴重而最難解決者，爲官僚資本，經濟部應宣布官僚資本之姓名，列爲革命之對象·經濟·財政·外交及交通各方，應配合解決目前經濟財政之問題。</p>
<p>〔周伯敏〕（一）貴州千幾百萬人之食鹽問題，相當嚴重，到處鹽荒，此由於鹽價增高之故，省內各地之鹽價，亦相差甚鉅，此種人民不可缺少之食物增加售價，是否有失民心。（二）陝西棉貸停止，使產棉區人民無法維持生產，即無異獎勵外國棉花進口，此種措施，是否經濟政策。</p>
<p>〔吳紹澍〕（一）各地物價飛漲，有人以爲係物資缺乏，故在上海曾要求行政院成立之敵僞產業處理局開放倉庫，標賣物資，以增加供應，但標賣結果，是誰人購得，購得後是否已經供應市面，必須予以調查。（二）中紡公司之出品，價格較黑市尤高，故滬市有「中紡」領導漲價之口號。（三）公務人員是否應取一律待遇，何以中紡公司及招商局高級職員有特殊優待。（四）行政院對當前種種問題，是否有解決辦法，如無辦法，即應向全會辭職。</p>
<p>〔鄭亦同〕（一）中央與地方之財政權責，應予劃分。（二）外匯開放後，應注意能源源供應，以免再造成黑市，經辦人員應嚴格操守。（三）接收使用敵偽物資，應有整個計劃。（四）官營民營應分別淸楚。</p>
<p>〔吳鐵城〕（一）戰前各銀行之小戶存欵，除投資放款外，多於戰時移存美國，當時幣値每法幣萬元可購美金三千元，而現在歸還存戶，每萬元僅値美金五元，應另定辦法，勿使小戶存戶蒙受損失。美方宣布中國人在美存款爲三萬萬五千六百萬美元，多爲我國各銀行之存款。（二）接收敵僞產業物炎，應迅速平價供應市場，以調節市價。（三）經濟事業官營者多失敗，且有官僚資本之譏，何不將民生必需之工業交由民營。</p>
<p>〔張九如〕（一）接收敵僞工廠如何經營，上海一區失業工人多至十七萬，現亦仍有八萬之多，經濟部應即組織淸理委員會，淸算公布接收敵偽物資。（二）黃金政策結果如何，法幣回籠情形如何，今後是否仍繼續執行黃金政策，黃金流出國外情形如何。（三）外匯管理如不得法，則操縱外匯者，將爲辦理外匯之銀行，財部是否有取締辦法，應禁止奢侈品進口，以免查取外匯，造成黑市。（四）各省豁免田賦後，地方政府束手無策，只好用攤派方法，更加重人民負擔，此實關係社會國家之安危，財政當局有無注意。</p>
<p>〔胡瑛〕財政金融應有更明確之報吿。</p>
<p>〔于望德〕外匯價格提高，是吾將影響正當用途，如留學生費用等。</p>
<p>〔劉健羣〕目前以「物」言，則工業凋敝，經濟枯竭，以「人」言，則官不聊生，民生疾苦，此種嚴重性，實不應忽視，主管當局有辦法說出來，無辦法想出來，有辦法挑起來，無辦法放下來，並主張另組經濟小組，研究對策。</p>
<p>〔黃旭初〕省保安隊規定之薪餉，尙不足伙食之半數，省級公務員之待遇太低，礦業統制辦法應予修改。</p>
<p>〔羅霞天〕主張實事求是，提出當前問題，切實謀解次辦法，不要因循苟且，以希望無問題爲已足。又中央政令與地方實際情形多衝突之處，亦亟應注意改善。</p>
<p>〔張邦翰〕公務人員及軍隊待遇，無以維持最低生活之水準，希望財政當局量出爲入，統籌辦法。</p>
<p>〔潘公展〕書面詢問：公務員待遇應吾平等，應吾平均提高，中紡公司及招商局高級職員之特殊待遇，是否屬實。</p>
<p>〔聞亦有　雷震〕書面詢問：請財部書面答覆，（一）兩次貨幣平準基金之用途，（二）開放外匯以前，歷年政府供給外匯之詳細數目及申請人姓名與其用途，（三）抗戰期間政府所結得之外匯數目。</p>
<p>〔吳敬恒〕歸納各委員意見，不外檢討法幣·黃金·外匯·物資四個問題，但法幣是政府所發行，如法幣無辦法，則一切俱談不到，法幣可隨意發行，而黃金則終屬有限，翁部長謂挽救物價要大家拿出良心來，惟買外匯·買黃金者，根本就沒有良心，且幫助物價上漲。黃金·外匯如「强盜」，謀刺法幣，如無法管制，此二「强盜」，則法幣必被殺害，政府如不能維持信用，則一切法幣，新幣均屬無用，所以特別提出「救救法幣」之口號。</p>

<p>黑暗時代可重臨勝利已蒙暗影西方之民主國家亟應團結一致</p>
<p>〔路透社密蘇里州富爾頓五日電〕英戰時首相邱吉爾，今日在此間西寺學院發表演說稱：英語民族倘不能如手足之情而聯絡一致，則仍難防止戰爭或促進世界機構之組織。英美兩國不但須以友好及互相諒解之精神，且需兩國軍事顧問保持密切關係，以研究潛伏之危機，然後始可培植手足聯絡一致之情誼。更需聯合利用兩國在全世界各地所有之海空軍根據地，乃能互保安全。黑暗時代可以重臨，好景不常，盟國之勝利今已蒙受暗影，吾人應自警惕。</p>
<p>邱吉爾繼建議聯合國機構應自有軍隊之組織曰：此可逐步爲之，但須即予實行，邀各國撥助若干隊空軍，爲世界機構服役，倘現在即以原子炸彈秘密告知聯合國機構，則將誤事矣，蓋世界空氣，今仍未寗靜也。英美倘能如余言而有手足情誼之聯絡，則可防患未然，進而奠定和平之基礎，惟英美保持特別關係，始能使世界機構有其地位而產生力址。</p>
<h3>不信蘇欲戰爭　但欲無限制擴張權力</h3>
<p>邱氏繼力言英蘇條約曰：余極景仰俄人及史太林同志之勇毅精神，英國今仍同情全俄羅斯民族而善意待之，幷始終不變與之保持永久友誼，中歐與東歐古國今皆已在蘇聯勢力範圍之內，惟光榮之雅典將在英美法觀察之下作決定其將來之選舉，波蘭政府今之對德行動則殊屬非是，東歐各國之共產黨本屬少數，今之顯露頭角，恐難勝任所負，竟欲爭取極權統治，現僅捷克斯洛伐克除外，餘皆無眞正之民主政治可言。蘇聯對土耳其所施之壓迫及德國境內俄人共產黨之情形，實皆非吾人於解放歐洲後進行建設所願見者，亦非足以構成永久和平之要素。凡此種種，殊令余有新戰爭難以避免之感覺。但余確信前途可由吾人決定之，且吾人握有挽救將來之權力，故今由於責任心之關係，直言出之，但余幷不相信蘇聯欲求戰爭，彼所期望者乃戰爭之結果及無限制擴張其權力及主義而已。今所急需者，惟爲謀一解次辦法，因循愈久，則夜長夢多，危機將益深矣，今已非爭取均權之世，倘西方民主國家能團結一致，恪守聯合國憲章，其力量即能促進此項原則。在此一九四六年，吾人以聯合國之權威，與蘇聯謀一切善意之諒解，當能達到此目的，英語民族聯合一致，信守憲章，邁步前進，當可安定將來之世界政局。</p>

<h3>促西人民自決命運　顚覆弗朗哥政府　三國聯合宣言昨發表　英不贊同西國問題提安理會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播稱：自英法美發表對弗朗哥之聯合宣言後，華盛頓官方認爲衹有西班牙軍隊，方有充分力量推翻弗朗哥政權，三國宣言所建議成立之新政府，次無法成立，因目前在西班牙國內，並無具有充分權力之政黨也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕政府要員今日聲稱：法國曾於上週致牒英美蘇三國，主張西班牙弗朗哥政權問題，提交聯合國安全理事會處置。英政府對此，已加拒絕，其理由爲更換弗朗哥，乃西班牙人民之問題，「外來勢力」，徒足加強弗朗哥之地位。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦四日電〕英美法三國政府本日晚間就西班牙問題發表聯合宣言稱：西班牙之命運應由西班牙人民自身決定，弗朗哥政府曾獲得納粹與法西期國家之援助，故弗朗哥一日存在，西班牙人民即一日不能與擊敗納粹及法西斯主義之國家發生正常關係，吾人無意干涉西班牙之內政，西班牙人民應自身決定本國之命運。弗郎哥政府對於西班牙人民之政治願望，雖採取高壓手段，但吾人仍希望其人民不致再遭受內戰之恐怖與痛苦。反之，吾人希望開明之西班牙人士，能迅速尋求各種方法，使弗朗哥和平退休，解散長槍會，設立臨時政府，俾予西班牙人民以自由決定其政府及選擇領袖之機會。政治犯之火赦，流亡西班牙人之歸國，集會及政治結社之自由及公共選舉法之規定，均爲要務。臨時政府如能獲得全體愛好自由人民之承認與擁護，將致力於此項目標，矢志不變。在此情形之下，吾人將立即與西班牙樹立外交關係，並將援助其解決各項經濟問題，則以此項問題目下尚無解決可能故也。至於對弗朗哥政權斷絕或保持外交關係一層，此事體大，須體察大局推移，並審度西班牙人民爭取自由之努力後，始可決定云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓四日電〕關於弗朗哥在戰時與軸心國之關係，美軍在德國境內抄獲大批檔案，經國務院專家分別研究之後，木日予以發表，證明當時軸心國，倘能承認西班牙對於直布羅陀港，丹吉爾港·法屬糜洛哥及阿爾熱一部份之要求，則弗朗哥即願放棄中立，而站在軸心國方面參戰。</p>

<h3>關於原子間諜案　加政府發表　調查報告　蘇使館主使其事刺探範圍計四項</h3>

<p>據莫斯科最近宣布：柴布丁已於十二月中由渥太華召回本國。報告書中並宣布下列四人遠犯加拿大機密法，直接或間接將秘密及機要情報洩漏於蘇聯。計有外交部譯電員華京夫人，曾以一密電內容告知蘇聯人員：加拿大情報局職員倫南上尉，係間諜領袖，直接聽命於蘇聯大使館軍事副參贊羅伐夫中校；國立研究院電機工程師馬格勒爾，原從事雷達工作，爲倫南所屬間諜之一，曾洩漏研究院關於雷達某稱發展之報告二種；英國特派員公署代理註册員成爾修女士，其地位可取得該署一切秘密文件，曾洩露若干秘密文件內容。</p>
<p>報告書又稱：此外尚有其他許多間諜極爲活動，且有實質上更重要之情報已被洩漏，但因各項證據尚未充分搜集，此時尚不能有所發表。</p>
<p>（又電）報告書並列舉被控協助蘇聯刺探秘密之人犯四名，經法庭審訊後已諭令還押，至三月十一日續審。四犯中僅華京夫人自稱有罪。</p>

<h3>美記者揭破東北行動暗幕：蘇軍趕造兵工廠</h3>
<p>— 星條報東北通訊員迭克遜　本報資料室譯</p>
<p>頑強傲慢的蘇軍，受着這一次戰爭勝利的鼓舞，認為這戰爭尚未終了，現在正在東北趕造一所龐大兵工廠。在亞州主要的一角土地，正強化着他們軍政的根據地。</p>
<p>在蘇軍佔領的這個新地帶中，蘇聯可怕的秘密警察，正製造着種種的恐怖，在戰略據點的大連旅順方面，蘇軍舉行着軍事演習。</p>
<p>從哈爾濱到大連，蘇軍幾已完成了工廠的刦　工作，來建立蘇聯軍事工業的實力。據可靠方面觀察，　使中國的北部一旦變成戰場，這區域將沒有任何工廠，可資對方利用。</p>
<p>在這工業原很發達的區域里，沒黨派的市民，講起他們在蘇軍統治下過日子，「真正比納粹統治的情形更糟，恐怖的橫行，較日本人更有過之無不及」。</p>
<p>不耐煩的新聞記者羣，終於把蘇軍在中國東北行動的神秘暗幕，給揭穿了。這些記者羣，認為蘇軍不該禁止發表這含有世界重要性的新聞。他們沖進了瀋陽，邁進到東北各個的遙遠的角落裹，成為不速之客。</p>
<p>顧不了佩着NKVD符號的蘇聯秘密察警一再的拘留，驅逐，逮捕和侮辱，這些記者羣還是潛入了瀋陽長春和大連。他們已搜集到了充份的新聞，足以作為蘇軍確實憑藉武力在亞洲獲取新的立足點之佐證。</p>
<p>據華軍方面談稱：蘇軍顯然有長駐東北之決心，蘇軍遠東總司令馬林諾夫斯基在長春紀念紅軍節的演說中，表現得很明顯。</p>
<h3>誰若伸手進入東北來　蘇軍便砍掉他　……遠東紅軍司令揚言</h3>
<p>華軍方面又說：蘇軍在攻入東北時，曾經過慘烈的戰爭，損失也很重，對這些難獲的利得，將不會輕易的放棄掉。中國人又說：蘇軍遠東總司令曾說，除了蘇聯之外，假使有任何人對東北伸進一隻手來，蘇軍一定要砍掉那隻手！</p>
<p>記者羣在緊關着的門的後邊，寫着通訊稿時，不時要防備着蘇軍衝進門來。記者羣聽到和看到了足以支持下述的結論的充份證據。</p>
<p>第一：所謂關東租借地－遼東半島大連旅順區，已變成蘇軍在東西的軍火廠。而中國方面根據中蘇條約說：旅順是由中蘇共營的，大連則列為自由港，對各國一律開放，但不能利用為軍事行動之用。</p>
<p>第二：蘇軍除非獲得中國在經濟和軍事上珍貴的讓步，蘇軍是決不撤離這區域的。他們日益堅持：目前即使出任何的代價，蘇軍也不預備放棄對大連和旅順的統治。</p>
<p>第三：蘇軍解釋中蘇條約說，在戰爭時期，蘇聯對大連負有全權。在日本簽訂和約前，蘇聯並不承認戰爭已告結束。同時，這塊土地是「租」給蘇聯的。</p>
<p>大連蘇軍司令科士洛夫中將斥責記者羣，在沒得到蘇軍的派司前，就闖進了他的統轄區時，說出了以上的一段話。他告訴記者說：「大連並不包括在東北以內。」</p>
<p>第四：到處都看得到的蘇軍秘密警察，自十月革命以來，對蘇聯的人民，就一直施着恐怖的圈套。現在又跟蘇軍開進了東北，對任何不服從黨的人，實施間諜、陰謀，和恫嚇的活動。</p>
<h3>蘇軍利用美國自由輪　搬走東北財產　…日兵士已無形失蹤</h3>
<p>第五：蘇軍對東北的重工業，已完成了有步驟的刦奪。他們把這些物資，用船隻裝到海參崴，運入蘇聯。據可靠方面消息：有些美國租借來的自由輪，也被用以運走這些　物。日本兵也被逼參加幫助刦奪的工作，之後，這些日本兵很神秘地失蹤了。瀋陽蘇軍司令考夫坦斯坦克維區一條可憎的輪船，也參加此一活動，可見他們已被遣送到蘇聯的西伯利亞，為蘇聯人服役了。</p>
<p>第六：軍正和中國的共產軍合作，把他們武裝起來，利用他們作為宣傳的工具。此間盛傳蘇軍正在招募日本軍官和技術人員，來製造日本人和中國人間的　擦。</p>
<p>目前，大致只有史太林才知道蘇軍將在什麽時候撤離東北。可是，即使蘇軍撤離，則過去日本人在瀋陽事變至太平洋戰爭為止的一段時期中所竭力構築了的大好工業地區，也早已「面目全非」了！</p>
<h3>機件被搬往西伯利亞　瀋陽只剩了空殼　民眾變成了驚弓之鳥</h3>
<p>— 本報三日航訊　平齊譯寄</p>
<p>瀋陽本是中國最重要的工業脊樑，現在却已經搶得只剩一個空殼了。它遭受了歷史上最科學化也是最澈底的搶刦和偷竊，已經成為一個無法無天的恐怖世界！</p>
<p>記者在此地逗留五天之后，得到了這些結論：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯當局已經把瀋陽的龐大工業設施一掃而空，把幾十萬噸的機器運到了西伯利亞去。</p>
<p>（二）几乎每天都有強暴行為，瀋陽的老百姓已經成為驚弓之鳥了</p>
<p>（三）蘇聯當局對于中共給予了極大的間接協助，還有不少可靠的證人宣稱：在這些間接的協助之外，他們事實上還直接合作。</p>
<p>（四）在瀋陽，正像在莫斯科一樣，中央政府毫無實權。</p>
<p>瀋陽被毀工業　比東京更猛烈</p>
<p>每一條街上的店鋪，都關了門，祇有人行道上的小攤，還在做買賣，所有商品，也無非是從日本人家里搶出來的零星舊貨而已。每天下午八點到早晨六點的戒嚴，使瀋陽的街道一到夜間便杳無人跡。每夜聽得見槍聲，偷·搶·暗殺·已經「司空見慣」。</p>
<p>日本人在瀋陽西郊，曾建立了一個工業區，東北各省全部的工業之中，百分之六十都在那邊，現在却已成一處廢墟。東京和大阪的破壞，固然利害，瀋陽的破壞，却比它們更為澈底。</p>
<p>工廠里的機器都已搶空，最先運走的是窗框，電話，和一些輕便的設備。中國的羣眾掙脫了日本約束縛之后，這是第一次的報復。</p>
<p>鞍山搬出機器　共達五六萬噸</p>
<p>接着，蘇聯當局帶來了卡車，日本戰俘變為搬運夫，拆除了各種設備。為搬運方便起見，就把牆壁打得七穿八洞。機器和設備——拆卸，運到了蘇聯。有一些空房子是炸毀了，有些還存在的，也祇剩下牆壁和屋面了。</p>
<p>有一個被迫參加這種工作的工程師告訴我：蘇聯當局在別處也造了這種事。他說：鞍山鋼鐵廠的百分之七十至八十，都被拆了下來，搬到亞塞港，大連，和朝鮮海口，再裝到海參崴。有幾只運輸的船隻還是美國的自由輪，不過由蘇聯人駕駛罷了。他說：從鞍山搬出去的機器達五六萬噸，而經過大連一地出口的，也有十五萬噸之多。</p>
<p>發電機被搬走　后患何堪設想</p>
<p>鴨綠江發電廠里的發電機也給蘇方搬走了，這發電廠是供給東北各省南部的電力的。發電機搬走之后，瀋陽常常斷電，自來水也時常中斷。</p>
<p>自來水中斷的後患，甚為嚴重污穢，如果天氣變暖，就有大規模發生傳染病的危險。東北已經有幾萬人，因傷寒症送了性命，使當局極為憂慮。</p>
<p>在瀋陽的街道上，我們這第一批到達的外籍記者很受歡迎，記者團一共二十二個人，美國，英國，法國人都有，其中有一部份是攝影記者。街上的中國行人停了脚步，急切地問我們：「美國人甚麽時候，可以運國軍到這里來？」連日本人都很高興，他們問：「甚麽時候可以把他們送回國去？」</p>
<p>國人若干偶語　即遭槍擊而死</p>
<p>此地的人們說話，都非常謹慎，而且再三叮囑寫稿時，不要提起他們的名字。有許多人根本拒絕接見記者，有一個消息說：有一個中國人和記者們說了幾句話，後來就在自己的大門口給人家用槍打死了。</p>
<p>這一種不安的情緒，不但影響了中國人民和日本人，同時也影響了白俄。德國的納粹份子，在瀋陽的大約有三十人，在蘇軍進駐的時候，他們倒似乎并不受到什麽打擊，有一個人告訴我：在蘇軍進城二個禮拜之後，他還親眼看見過德國俱樂部的屋頂上照樣還掛着國社黨的旗幟。</p>
<p>蘇軍對于共軍　直接間接裨助</p>
<p>有人指摘蘇軍曾經三度協助了八路軍攻擊國軍，但是這種蘇聯對中共的直接援助，却還不易證實。瀋陽蘇軍司令考夫坦史坦開維區少將，曾經否認過這種說法。他說：祇有一次，有一輛紅軍裝番薯的卡車，曾在國共戰場上受到了損壞。</p>
<p>有人目擊共軍用的是日軍繳下的武器，有一個被俘的共軍官，也說過一支蘇軍聯絡隊，曾供給他的部隊九挺日軍的機關槍，此外還有別的配備。</p>
<p>這些蘇軍對於共軍的直接援助，是否真確，我們暫置不論。但共軍間接的受到協助，却是極明白的事實。政府軍因為必需得到最高當局的許可之後才能調動，所以在東北就不能自由行動，而共軍却可隨意調動，這就給了八路軍極大的幫助。在目前，中央軍據守着從錦州到瀋陽的鐵道，瀋陽四郊也有一些部隊。但除掉這些地方之外，所有的鄉區裏都是共軍的天下。</p>
<p>蘇軍舉行示威　彈穿我司令部</p>
<p>共產黨在東北的實力，究竟怎樣，各人的估計不同。我所聽到的一個數目是三十萬人，據說其中有五萬左右，是久歷戎行的八路軍，其他的隊伍，都是就地徵募出來的。</p>
<p>瀋陽城裏，有六位國民政府派來的市政長官，外加一個司令部，司令是彭璧生將軍，可是誰也沒有實權，這個城市是完全由蘇聯軍隊統治的。</p>
<p>前夜，蘇聯坦克軍在中央第二十五師司令部周圍百碼之內舉行示威，共達四小時之久。司令部的牆壁，也中了好幾槍。蘇軍的砲手，曾闖進中央派來的瀋陽市長所住旅館的房間裏，想去奪取他的無綫電收音機，有人很客氣的勸告彭璧生將軍和別的長官搬到蘇聯管理的旅館裏去住。</p>
<p>蘇軍把持工廠　損失無法估計</p>
<p>中國當局無法估計這次蘇聯在此地掠奪的確切損失，因為有些工廠，至今還由蘇軍把守，中國人是不準進去的。如果事前未經蘇軍許可，中國人是無能為力的。中國的長官們自己都生活於恐懼之中，這種恐懼是正月間張莘夫和六個隨從人員，在撫順被暗殺之後引起的，而這次暗殺發生時的情形，使許多人相信俄國人與本案是有密切關係的。</p>
<p>今日的瀋陽，像一個被敵方軍隊佔領的城市。比較起來，東京的居民還是幸福的。</p>
<h3>四腳文化在台灣</h3>
<p>— 本報航訊會今可寄</p>
<p>伊藤博文紀行詩遊台灣云：「同仁一視沒陰晴，須以斯心策治平，滿堂唱和乾坤動，日本天皇萬萬聲。」</p>
<p>台灣自一八九五年馬關條約劃讓日本，五十一年來，台胞受日人的奴化教育和「皇民化」政策的結果，文化的本身起了很大的變化。台灣文化的內容變成了一種複雜東西，不但不是純粹的中國的文化，而且也不是純粹的日本文化。台胞以日本和服為外衣，而襯衣則仍舊是中國式的汗衫。雖然是在日本奴化教育與奴化政治的強制壓迫之下，台胞仍能永遠保持其民族觀念，以民族精神作頑強的消極的抵抗，也是值得欽佩的。</p>
<p>五十一年前，無能的滿清政府竟以「台抗京危」的卑劣，懦弱心理，迫使台胞接受日本的統治。當時的台胞對祖國是怎樣的失望。五十一年來，日人用盡種種的方法來奴化台胞，雖然有少數台灣士紳和浪人願供日人驅策，因而使日本得向全世界誇稱其治台成績優良。</p>
<p>日本政府把上述的伊藤那首詩和台北市的照片，同印在明信片上，向全世界宣傳。第一句固然要大打折扣。第二句完全暴露了日本對台灣的野心，三四兩句在肉麻之中，可　見日本「奴化」並「皇民化」台胞的成績。但大多數的台胞都是衷心厭惡日本統治者及其風俗習慣，文物制度，譏為「四脚文化」，此語實沉痛而幽默。</p>
<p>因為台灣文化和中國文化有着五十一年的久別，以致在已經光復的今日，仍不能迎頭趕上，這本是意料中的事，又因為日本向來以台灣為殖民地，不允許台灣人民學習殖民地人民所不能學習的學術，所以台胞對社會科學方面的基礎太差。現在台胞一方面要努力從學習國語和國文着手，以接近祖國的文化，一方面又要開始努力學習社會科學，然後才能建設新台灣的文化。</p>
<p>與男子平等</p>
<p>台灣的婦女過去和日本的婦女一樣，無論在社會在家庭，都沒有地位，沒有權力。現在的台灣婦女即中國的女同胞，中國是男女平等的。而現在的台灣婦女大多數還是在做下女、做女招待，做店員，做賣票員。這也是教育的關係。因為過去台灣女同胞是受日本教育的，日本教育在精神上和形式上男女都不相同，絕對不許婦女自由發揮她的才能，更談不到讓她們參加政治活動了。現在，台灣的婦女可以與男子平等，台灣省地方行政幹部訓經團各期受訓的學員中都有女性，她們已經覺悟而且證明了她們的地位確已提高。將來的台灣婦女一定是可以和台灣的男子並駕齊驅，凡是各國婦女所能做的事，她們一定能做而且一定能夠做好。</p>
<p>青年的苦悶</p>
<p>台灣青年過去以受職業教育者為最多數，即受大學教育者，也都是學醫科和農科的。所以，職業問題幾乎是現在台灣青年羣的一個最嚴重的問題。失業乃台灣青年最大的苦悶。有幾位台灣省地方行政幹部訓練團中學師資訓練班的學員曾以日語向我訴說失業時的痛苦。台灣接收的情形雖甚良好，但停工的工廠大多數尚未恢復，青年就業的機會較少。加以物價日高，生活難以維持。失業的青年都希望能夠馬上得到工作。</p>
<p>陳長官到台灣就職的時候，即表示樂於任用台灣青年。除台灣省行政長官公署早已舉辦「備用人員登記」外，省訓練團舉辦的「企業管理人員訓練班」亦已結訓，所有受訓學員都已由長官公署派以職務。現在省訓練團正在繼續舉辦「會計人員訓練班」和「民政人員訓練班」，「宣傳工作人員訓練班」等。所以，台灣青年的職業問題，將來是不成問題的。</p>
<p>台灣青年的第二種苦悶，即不懂國語與國文，國文尚可慢慢地學習，國語的需要則尤其迫切。於是，各處就有許多的國語補習學校出現，教法優良的自然也有，但發音不準確的也不少。急切要學習國語的台灣青年，常常發現一字有數種不同的發音，究竟不知那種音是正確。省訓練團的學員也曾經向教育長報告，國語教師發音不一樣。在國內，無論係南腔北調，總可以聽得懂，在孤懸海外，淪陷五十一年的台灣，教國語的老師們似乎應該以標準音去教才好。</p>
<p>幣制及匯兌</p>
<p>台灣現仍行使台幣，查台幣為日本官商合辦的台灣銀行所發行，與法幣比率，經陳長官核定，台幣一元合法幣三十元。但在台北市上，僅須以二十元或二十四元之法幣即可換到一元台幣。因為沒有國家的銀行，台灣和內地各省都不通匯兌。來台工作人員百分之九十五以上的眷屬都還在內地，匯款乃成為一種最大的困難。現在都是由台灣省行政長官公署彙匯上海，再由上海分別代匯各省。遠的地方不談，即隔日可達的福州，由長官公署代匯之款竟需兩個月以後方能收到。因而有些人情願犧牲台幣一元匯法幣三十元的權利，把台幣去換法幣（二十元），託人帶到福州去匯往家裏。所有來台的公教人員都盼望國家銀行能夠早日來台，以後的匯兌才可便利。記者發稿時，聽說行政院宋院長已由上海飛抵台北，也許他此來可以解決台灣的若干困難。（二，廿四）</p>
<p>新法訓練飛行員　美國潔恩小姐用雷氣操縱器開動一架雛形飛機。此操縱器與正式操縱器無異，專用以訓練飛行員。此項發明，將於一九四六年四月在支加哥舉行世界發明展覽會時，公開陳列展覽。</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>如何以最短時間完成中國戰后建設</h3>
<p>本文為美國白朗大學教授肯　遜（.Prof．W．I．K　enter．on，Brown　Uni）所作，氏現任中國軍委會工程顧問，在華二年餘，對軍事工程貢獻甚多，近始返美。作此文以示其對我國戰後建設之意見，足供國人參考。由軍委會工程委員陶述曾君譯出，以供眾覽。——　　　。（三月一日）</p>
<p>（一）題旨　本文之主旨在提供一種方法，依此方法可於最短時間完成中國戰後偉大之建設。</p>
<p>（二）範疇　本文僅討論國營建設，其民營及省營而無全國性之建設不在討論之列，又本文僅討論政府經營之方法，依此可使最多量之建設事業完成於最少量之時間，不論及國營建設資本之籌集。</p>
<p>（三）總論　為確保世界永久和平，中國取得遠東各國之領導地位實為極端重要，為期獲得此地位，中國必須於今後廿五年內求得其他國家從來未有之成就，有志竟成，視中國之願力耳。成此大業，必須喚起全民，勇往邁進，各盡所能，專家之信任尤須注重。</p>
<p>（四）工程司之組織　（甲）中國專家極為缺少，不應棄置於閒散或用之不盡所能，為使每一工程司均發揮其最大能力與最高效率計，吾人建議於行政院下，組織一建設部，其組織包括五個總局：〔1〕鐵路總局，〔2〕公路總局，〔3〕航空總局，〔4〕港埠總局，〔5〕國營水利工程總局。五局之外，成立一設計委員會，以次長兼充為主席，五局局長兼充委員，秉承部長，領導此五局之工作。</p>
<p>（乙）建設部之任務如下：〔1〕編造五年建國計劃。〔2〕平衡本部及其他部會主管之國營事業。〔3〕設計國營工程。〔4〕編制工程預算。〔5〕指導或協助指導國營工程之施工。〔6〕充主席工程行政之輔佐，作其他部會之工程顧問。〔7〕作國營工程之提案勘測與報告。〔8〕審議工程器材之購置。</p>
<p>（丙）各總局責有專司，但均須直接秉承部長，以便互相調節配合成一融和之整體。</p>
<p>（丁）必須特為提出者，建設部已完成驗收之工程即移交於使用或管理部會，建設部之職責在國營工程之籌劃，配合，設計，估價及施工，但於完工後不　使用，不　保修，此部為一純粹服務之組織，其經費支取於國庫，而不取之於所作工程使用之收入，使所有工程司，均歸入公僕之範疇，為國家及人民作最高效率與最經濟之服務。</p>
<p>（五）組織建設部之利益　組織建設部，國家將迅即收獲下列之利益：</p>
<p>（甲）國營工程集中於單一主辦機構，集中主辦效率高而經濟，重複設施可以免除，管理及使用機構旣不兼作新工，可以集全力從事於使用，管理及保修，建築權責操之於有專學與有長期經驗者之手，必然經濟。</p>
<p>（乙）其他部會間之工作易於配合：中國將來之地位須視政府對現前困難之了解及努力如何，目前缺乏交通，生產低落，購置力弱，出進口減縮，種種嚴重問題之解決均有待於工程師最嚴密籌劃之五年計畫，不僅一個五年計劃已也，必須有數個五年計劃，而每一計劃對全國之交通·運輸·生產及原料之增產等等問題均作相當解決，惟工程司能對以上各問題作最適當之籌劃與配合，個各主管部會能信任同一政府機構之調整計劃而依照實施，則彼此工作互相配合，行政便利，效率提高，浪費減少，乃為必然之結果，建設部將為五年建國計劃設計調整最適宜之機構。</p>
<p>（丙）每一工程司得到有效率之使用：依此組織則每一工程司可以置於其最適合之職位，如一局工作稍閒，即可將其工程司及輔助職員調往另一局使用，此種經濟之用法惟有隸屬同一上級機構之組織始能得此便利，中國工程司太少，而當前待興之建設計劃甚多，在最近十數年內應使每一工程司每日都盡其全力為國工作。</p>
<p>（丁）營業技師及私營公司可予盡量運用：中國建設規模極為宏大，盡全國公私工程司建築司用以設計施工尚不敷，如有一個中央建設機構，如所提議之建設部都於以盡量運用營業技師私營公司之力量，并培植外國人士在中國所經營之建築公司與顧問事務所，更以訓練新式工具之運用，實屬根本需要。</p>
<p>（戊）破壞因素之力量可以減除：中國之現時不安狀態固因受到世界全域動盪狀態之影響；但由於中國內部之特殊狀態尤多，在此特殊狀態之內，中國政府竟不能對於某區域有所設施，此項區域又因交通困難生產低落，故情形更為嚴重，因生產之缺乏，致使人民購買力低減，復因人民購買力之低落而減少貨物之生產，兩者互為因果，積久形成惡性之循環，為今之計，應在此等區域予以必需之運輸工具，完成鐵路·公路·航空·水道等交通網，發展其豐富之天然利源，更使其民眾工業化，則此種不安狀態自可減除矣，而所以達到上述目的之道則在使工程司等為之開溝洫·築隄防·建水力·排積潦·使千百萬畝旱潦頻仍之地可以耕種并確保定量之收穫，各種建設即予着手，使人民力有所用，且親見政府實施復員與建國之計劃，則動盪不安之情況必將隨各項事業之成就而逐漸輕減以至於消除，惟適當組織之工程司集團能使中國有適當配合之鐵路，公路，航空系統，惟工程司之力能挽回江河之狂瀾使成中國有益之建設力原，惟工程司之力能提高一般人民生活標準，增加國內之團結，掃凈地方失望及動盪不安之因素，工程司之組織將反射出新中國之強盛與威力。</p>
<p>（六）建議　茲謹作以下之建議：</p>
<p>（甲）行政院下組立建設部，負國營工程籌劃，設計及施工之責。</p>
<p>（乙）建設部部長必須為一有專學，有技能，有魄力生氣勃勃之工程司，且須具有領袖器度，行政經驗與管理能力。</p>
<p>（丙）建設部所有之工程司均銓敘文官，使其職位有所保障，使其功級有所昇獎，使其薪俸合乎職責，使其感覺為國服務，獲得相當之尊重。</p>
<p>（丁）私營公司營業技師及外國人民在中國經營之公司或事務所，參加建國工作者均受建設部之培植。</p>
<p>（戊）建設部設外籍專家顧問團，協助部長撰寫五年建國計劃，協助大規模國營工程之籌劃，設計及施工，協助研究工作，如土壤力量，地基設計，水利模型試驗等並協助其採購工程器材，使中國工程技術及所使用之器材與先進工業國同樣進步。</p>
<p>（己）建設部應與工程學院合作，功課中加入關於工程問題之系統的研究，於以提高工程畢業生之知識，並作為日後工程上更經濟更進步之設計與施工之資料，中國土壤必須依工程觀點而分類，各大河流域面積必須勘察，水文學必須普遍研究，水土保持與大片荒地開墾之方法必須得有把握，預防水患之學問必須較之已往遠為推進也。</p>
<h3>業餘無綫電呼籲　保障學術自由</h3>
<p>— 沈一之</p>
<p>最近報載：交通部電信監察科，成立于上海，辦理無線電廠商，收音機及另件購置與使用之聲請登記等手續；目的為不使無綫電器械流入歹徒之手以作違法使用，并曾與一部廠商開過一次談話會。雖然還不曾公佈辦法，可是就各報所載幾點觀之，真不禁為吾業餘無綫電研究界前途慮。而吾業餘同仁，亦迄無意見提出，或者指其利弊所在，以供當軸的參考或採內。不侫忝為業餘同志之一，對當軸所擬施行購買無綫電器械一點願述所見。</p>
<p>英國對收音機用戶本也是施行登記和收費的，逃避登記納費，罰則也相當嚴厲，但相反的，對業餘研究者特別例外，一個業餘家儘可自由自在的到任何一家電器公司去選購或定製他所需要的另件；政府還有種種獎勵和資助的辦法。飛機的駕駛，潛艇的操縱，不知費掉日以繼夜在實驗室中研究者的幾許心血，火箭，雷達，也不是從泥土中生長而成。可是，我國祇講「形式」，不問「實際」。去年十月九日委員長在陪都中央電台廣播：「文化建設的方針，在獎進科學研究，保障學術自由，而改進社會風氣…」科學—無綫電自亦科學之一—在現世紀之重要固然是人盡皆知，惟有「獎勵科學研究，保障學術自由」，而後始可從研究者手中貢獻給政府新的發現，新的改革，新的成功！現在我們並不希望政府給我們「獎進」，但「保障學術自由」，這是否們最低限度的要求！前報載該科發表：「購買無綫電器械應向監察科聲請，由科發給『購置證』後，始可憑『證』向指定商號購買……」一節：我們知道一個業餘家購買另件大致在匆促之間的，並不是預計的。現在旣經「聲請」，從然能夠僥倖被「審查合格」領到一張「購置證」，那末其間所費日期，決非在三五天之內，那時研究者早已心悔意懶，再也提不起興趣來；何況還有被「審查」後不能「合格」的，以及外埠來申購買不能久候等種種原因。這簡實是阻撓「科學研究」，限制「學術自由」；而社會風氣由何改進，文化建設由何完成？</p>
<p>鄙意應由交通部當軸成立「無綫電業餘研究會」，業餘家均須入會，但需相當保證，以免奸究混入，每年酌收會費，以充此項各種支出費用，由會發給證件及購置證（須粘附照片），不分地區，不限數量，不論種類，不需聲請，凡屬會員，均有「自由購買」之權；惟經售商應抄錄購買證號碼等，列表呈報，以備當局隨時核查。</p>
<p>盼望業餘家起響應，來促成當軸實行，給吾們學術自由的保障！</p>

<h3>全國郵局入不敷出　虧蝕月逾十億</h3>
<p>郵日資是否調整未奉命令</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市郵政管理局帮辦王裕光昨告記者稱：勝利來臨之際，上海郵局因調整郵費關係，頗獲盈餘，但日來物價飛漲，郵資收入，已不敷支出，最近全國郵局之虧蝕，每月總額已達十餘萬萬元之鉅，成爲國家重大負擔。記者旋詢郵局是否考慮調整郵資，王帮辦答稱：目前尚未接獲總局關於此點之任何命令。至於東北九省之郵政情形，則哈爾濱長春二郵局已經接收竣事，並於長春成立總局辦事處。蘇北華北各地之郵政亦尙未全復正常，有待折衝，王氏並透露，此項問題恐需在北平獲得解決。台灣方面郵政暢通，但該處向係郵電合一，組織與我國各地微有不同，接收後之正副局長，逕由交通部委派，目前尙未赴任。至郵局是否將恢復國外匯兌業務，尙待郵政儲匯局決定。</p>
<h3>已死漢奸產業　請示如何處理　傳筱庵等逆產查獲極多</h3>
<p>敵寇侵華期內，爲虎作倀之漢奸，於勝利前，未受國法制裁，而已徼倖死亡者，其所遺逆產，是否與未死及已被逮捕之漢奸逆產受同樣處置，予以全部充公，抑仍由該奸逆之繼承人繼承，而不予處置，政府當局迄未有明文規定。最近敵僞產業處理局查緝組，曾緝獲上述情形之逆產多起，以無法處置，故已呈請行政院解釋。據該組人員稱，已死漢奸之逆產，似應與未死漢奸之逆產同樣處置，否則已死之漢奸太便宜，旣逃國法，又得保持產業。如最近該組查獲上海市第一任僞市長傳逆　庵之逆產，數値至足驚人，其中一部份，仍用傳逆戶名，一部份則已更易其繼承人之戶名，據已查出之傅逆產業有中匯銀行·中亞銀行·民孚銀行·寗紹輪船公司·寗紹保險公司大宗股票，祥大源五金號及武昌路一四〇號，武昌路八十九弄六號兩堆棧內大量五金材料，不動產有武昌路源安里全弄房屋，戈登路勞勃生路源和里全弄房屋，楊樹浦一二八六號洋房一幢及霞飛路等地產房屋，上列房屋堆棧，現已由查緝組加封保管，一俟政院解釋復示到達，即可予以確定處置。</p>
<p>其他逆產查獲多起</p>
<p>該處於近數日內，並查獲兩經濟大漢奸僞火柴統制聯合會理事長陳逆伯藩·僞中日實業銀行總經理吳逆庸庵及僞安徽省長高冠吾在本市所置之房地產二百餘幢。陳吳高三逆，早爲我軍事當局逮捕，其逆產則甫於數日前根據密告查獲。陳逆在環龍路一帶共有洋房七十餘幢，此外並有大量地產。吳逆置有狄思威路祥茂里全弄房屋及賈爾義愛路一六二號至一六七號，曁同路一七八弄全弄房屋，共計九十一幢之多。高逆冠吾，則置有南市肇嘉路六六九弄（泰瑞里）房屋十七幢。上列逆產，頃已由查緝組加封，聞將予全部充公。</p>
<p>日商輪隻查獲兩艘</p>
<p>此外查緝組根據密報，有日商某洋行於勝利後將其所有之協順協茂輸船二艘，分別讓渡與華商江蘇輪船公司及華民運輸公司經營，經查緝組向該兩公司詳細調查讓渡經過，發覺該兩公司所持之證據不足，且有僞造之嫌，故於上週末將協順協茂扣留充公，將撥歸招商局接管。</p>
<h3>主婦被盜捆綁</h3>
<p>萬生路發生刦案</p>
<p>南市萬生路希善里二號住戶孔永卿家，昨晚七時半，突來三匪，各出手槍，用圍巾捆綁主婦等，當被刦去金戒八只，金錫二副，金圈一副，金手錶一只而逸。</p>
<h3>再審石原勇案　週內或可宣判</h3>
<p>美戰犯審判委會，昨日再審日戰犯前江灣與吳淞集中營翻譯石原勇，並傳前吳淞集中營主任佐藤到庭作證。該日人耐心而不厭其煩，向庭上解說自身對此事不大淸楚，後來方知石原勇有虐待戰犯之行爲。並稱彼於得知此事後，馬上將石原勇免職。該案定今晨再審，在本星期或可宣判。</p>
<h3>成都路坍屋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕成都路一二八號過街樓，因年久失修，昨午零點十五分許，突然坍下，當塲壓傷男子沃　慰一名，頭胸部受傷。</p>
<h3>對美電滙率昨無變動　申請登記者漸多</h3>
<p>（本報訊）昨日中央銀行所宣佈之對美電匯率，仍爲二〇二〇元。各指定銀行及外匯經紀人，乃參照買賣，市塲終日平穩。記者曾走訪某指定銀行國外部負責人，據告：目前交易不多，期貨買賣，中央銀行暫不開做，惟各指定銀行如有期貨頭寸者，仍可設法開做多少，期限最長三個月。現時因中央銀行僅宣佈對美電匯率，故對其他各國匯率，如有客戶前來結匯，須由各指定銀行自覓比率水準，比較稍感困雜。又聞外匯市塲上交易買賣，中央銀行售出外匯時無佣金之支付，進出口商與經紀人間之佣金，爲每千元二角五分。銀行與經紀人間之佣金，爲每千元一角二分半。</p>
<p>又訊：進出口商已逐漸恢復常態，昨紛向二十七家指定銀行及核定外匯經紀人接洽，較前日更形踴躍。直至五時許，據中央銀行外匯審核處聲稱，業已接到中外行商申請外匯者已四十多起。</p>
<h3>美戰地記者　自瀋陽返滬</h3>
<p>蘇方曾下逐客令</p>
<p>據美軍訊：美戰地記者七人，於昨日自瀋陽返抵上海，彼等自稱，此行係蘇軍下逐客令之結果。在東北期間，行動失去自由，等於軟禁。各記者自瀋陽來電均遲到，但各記者雖不能長駐東北採訪，而一般人對於微妙莫測之東北局勢，更爲注意。</p>
<h3>調節民食緊急措置　標賣大宗雜糧</h3>
<p>糧政特派員辦公處，爲迅速調節民食起見，特於昨日下午三時，假該處會議室與敵僞產業處理局，會同辦理標賣雜糧，計苞米五千〇二十五包，高粱七千六百五十三包，山芋六百〇八包，赤豆八十一包，合計爲一萬三千噸，並不限投標人資格，截至昨日止，投標人已達六十九單位。</p>
<h3>駛閔航輪中途遭刦　拒捕格鬥三四小時　警長王振昌殉職詳情</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行駛上海至閔行問之航船，每晨由蘇州河老閘橋駛出，至午後五時許抵閔。前日又有一航船，裝載麵粉白糖等貨，搭載旅客三十餘名，於下午一時半駛抵浦東王家渡相近，詎下艙預伏匪徒四人，混充旅客，拔出盒砲手槍等，威脅船上旅客，恣意搶刦。幸船子機警，以暗號向浦東岸上發出，岸上軍警察覺，發槍數響，匪膽稍寒，立即停止洗刦，不幸遭刦者僅數人而已，損失尚屬有限。</p>
<p>民衆恊助捕盜</p>
<p>當船抵浦西華涇口，匪即躍過一小船，命舟子迅即靠岸，登岸後，携贓飛逸。其時小輪上一部份旅客相繼上陸，尾隨緊追，該管龍華分局長橋鎭派出所巡官羅夢漁已得據報，率領八六〇一號，警長山東人王振昌及四警士追趕，發槍遙射，匪徒情急，於是竄越至滬杭公路，第四號橋樑，迨追至第三號橋時，民衆愈聚愈多，隨後協助，人聲鼎沸。</p>
<p>警長身中兩彈</p>
<p>匪徒見捕者衆多，分成二隊，在田隴中各據一墓墳，發槍還擊，王振昌警長奮不顧身，首先衝至一墳側，將徒手兩匪擒住，交警士看守，仍賈其餘勇，奔至另一墓傍，距離匪徒僅五步之遙，胸脯左腿均已中彈，不支而踣，一匪遂上前出刀猛刺其頭部，達十一刀之多，致血流如注，氣息僅屬，警帽一頂，亦被攫去。</p>
<p>格鬥三四小時</p>

<h3>銀根緊買戶少　金價逐步下挫　銀樓實銷亦平淡</h3>
<p>烚赤昨晨開一五〇萬有賣，開後自一五二萬逐漸小挫，銀根仍無鬆動之象，持貨者紛紛供售，藉以套利，曾退至一四五萬以下，銀樓方面稍來吸納，又微升至一五〇萬大關，午刻一四七萬左右俳徊而已，後市交易寥落，市價在一四六萬至一四九萬小有掙扎，結果較前回落三萬，銀樓方面實銷漸形平淡，以致買戶稍形觀望，飾金初掛十六萬四，降至十六萬，最後十六萬二，紋銀仍爲一千八，銀元亦趨平定，在八五〇元左右徘徊，暗拆以大部份銀根趨往蘇錫圖利，仍形緊張，惟　價仍在二角至三角半間。</p>
<h3>電匯仍開原價　進口商吸美鈔　新港票有人哄抬</h3>
<p>外幣美鈔屈居二千元以下，中行電匯仍開二〇二元原價，上午在一九六〇元至二千元間，午後雖聞掛牌改低二十元，但人心未受影響，進口商對現鈔仍有吸收備用者，最後在二千元大關盤旋，結果較前收微挫十元，電匯二千至二〇二〇元，五金商有所結進，一九一〇元生絲商有結售，港票老貨初穩後平，新貨則投機帮續謀出路，三六年哄至一〇二元有買，三七年一〇〇元有買，結果老平，新貨再好七元。</p>
<h3>查禁日見森嚴　證券毫無生氣</h3>
<p>公債昨以查禁更嚴，半日成交閑散，達於極點，除丙種而外，餘均的計之喊價而已，結果丙種在多方稍稍斬售下，跌一七〇元，甲乙跌一三〇元，丁種種一〇〇元，戊降八十元，華股走勢不振，過程平而狹，永紗在二五〇〇元，美亞一九〇〇元，景福一二五元左右，盤旋而已，毫無特殊變化，午收結果較前收各股升降俱微，外股受銀根壓迫，證券帮求現供售下，賣氣轉濃，午收都以賣價結束，結果亦挫落少許</p>

<h3>絲茶均疲</h3>
<p>昨市絲綢環境欠佳，一致繼續下降，尤以廠經疲軟更甚，高五担喊二百十萬元，普通另担進二百萬元關內，人心虛軟，交易淸淡，人造絲一二〇號大橋現貨開盤一百十二萬元，降至一百七十七萬元收盤，午後塲外喊一百八十萬元，有人肯脫手，然因廠商配給在即，並無成交，半光愈做愈高，喊過二百萬元，卒做一百九十五萬元，綢貨隨原料而低落，美亞被面晨喊一百廿七萬元，後做一百廿五萬元，大誠格璧縐四千一百五十元開盤，後做四千元。</p>
<p>邇來由溫州及台灣等地，運來大批紅綠茶花色，的有數千箱，實銷雖有，客方爭相吐售，市勢頗有供過於求之憾，行情遂難以立足，下瀉甚勁，溫州紅茶跌進四萬元內，台灣茶花軋落萬元左右，其他花色市存仍不豐厚，持者緊態依然，故價格尚能穩定，但交易均告减色。</p>
<h3>紗市人心平淡　現棉交易不惡</h3>
<p>昨日紗市又趨下游，緣前日收市後，紡建公司供售較多，加以各大紗廠開出廿支紗，亦有相當數額，致同行之絀於銀根者，乃相繼脫貨求款，客銷一時未能暢達，價乃下降五萬至十萬，人心因是平淡。</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况尚穩定，交易依然不惡，紡建公司吸胃未衰，計進米特林及巴西花共計一千件，又民營寳豐紗廠進通州花二百包，同業互做周浦籽花，價一萬五千五百元云。</p>

<h3>紡建業務槪況</h3>
<p>售價較高之原因</p>
<p>日昨棉布公會傳出消息，謂中國紡織建設公司對於棉布公會會員限制加入，據該公司業務處張似旅蔣迪先兩處長，稱並非事實，該公司近況如下：</p>
<p>（一）該公司已登記之紗布廠號計有：</p>
<p>紗號三二九家，布號八一二家，（包括織布廠及毛巾廠），針織廠一九八家，染織廠二八六家，內衣廠五八家，手帕廠八〇家，呢絨廠一七四家。</p>
<p>（二）滬市各公司出售之平價布，以每人限購一丈五尺，故售價低廉，該公司所售之紗布，數量並無限制，日係營業性質，故售價較各公司爲高。</p>
<p>（三）該公司每逢星期一四開售棉紗，星期二五開售棉布，星期三六開售蔴毛呢絨等。</p>
<p>（四）該公司內部計分業務·工務·會計·稽核·秘書等五處。</p>

<p>（本報訊）滬商陳中沐等近發起一大規模之糧食公司，定名爲華聯糧業股份有限公司，資本五萬萬元，先收半數，以米麥及雜糧之加工及運輸爲業務。</p>
<h3>柴炭銷旺</h3>
<p>煤市承前趨勢，白煤篩塊續俏，烟煤屑及白煤下身銷路仍爲呆滯，柴炭到貨漸增，而走銷亦不弱，市氣甚爲緊俏。</p>
<h3>敵僞產業審議會　不准發還刦餘紗布　移動已久無從查證</h3>
<p>本市棉布染織紗業三公會請求發還刦餘紗布一案，敵僞產業處理局會提交法律顧問委員會研討，結果認爲收買紗布確爲敵僞所强迫，此項刦餘紗布依照處理辦法及法律觀點，自應發還，並有永新永昌立成等五家，已經檢同證件，呈奉處理局核准發還，其他一千七百餘家，亦正在檢集證件，依法申請，詎知第四十九次敵僞產業審議會，以僞棉統會徵購紗布，歷時已久，所有紗布，自接收以來，多已移動或雙賣，無從查證，所請碍難照准，各紗布號如持有僞中儲行存單，有未收價款部份，可逕向僞中儲行淸理處申請淸理，法律顧問委員會通過發還一部份紗布之永新等號，事先未經本會核准，原決議應予撤銷，作爲無效等語，全市棉布染織紗業聞此決議，莫不震驚，紛紛要求公會依法力爭，聞公會方面業正在磋商應付辦法云。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>棉織品因紗市報小，仍徘徊疲途，惟九〇一鵝牌汗衫去化較旺，價獨升二千元。</p>

<p>紙張因印刷工人怠工，實銷大受影響，中紙到貨甚少，售價不易降低。</p>
<p>五金市價，多在軟檔盤旋，少有上落，衹　球牌鋒鋼因受廠方垂靑，且存貨稀薄，獨露鋒鋩。</p>

<h3>昨晚籃球聯賽　得意傑作　華聯克江灣　張良雄射籃有神助結果五二比三七分</h3>
<p>華聯籃球隊昨晚展開極順利之攻勢，以五十二比三十七分大勝江灣美空軍隊，在籃球聯賽中，造成四戰四勝之紀錄，上半時二十七比二十一，華聯佔先六分，市體育館內千五百觀衆，歡呼若在。華聯李震中缺席，僅到陳學崇·張良雄。孔廣益·包松圓四人，法定時間已過，吳成章才來凑滿起賽。張良雄昨晚射籃似有神助，其妙無比，獨得廿分，可謂昨晚之大功臣。上半時華聯一路佔先，每超二三分，各十五十七後，華聯脫穎而出，以二十七比二十一結束上半時。下半時開始，得分主將張良雄已掛上四次犯規，無不爲華聯危，幸攻勢仍不衰，二十九比二十五後，華聯一氣呵成，連得十三分，以四十二比二十五超前十七分之多，江灣雖反攻奪回七分，華聯仍聯珠而中，結果以五十二比三十七獲勝。華聯表演極度佳妙，江灣空軍射籃雖準，而陣綫凌亂，是爲失敗主因。賽前一場，綠林以四十七比三十三勝海英。</p>

<h3>戰時浙江文化搖籃　國立英士大學掠影（下）</h3>
<p>— 黃藍</p>
<p>現在全校計有學生一千餘人，本年度春季班工學院曁行政財政兩專科復添招二百七十名，明年度名額當更可增多。設備方面半因成立歷史過暫，自難充實，半因歷屆浙東戰事學校損失太甚。故至今尚極簡陋，敎育部雖允在投員費項下撥給設備費九萬萬元，唯按實際需要恐將仍感不敷，至於敎授人選皆係歷年廣事搜羅所得，除少數不滿人意外，大體均爲學問淵博之士，校中功課頗見嚴緊，尤以工學院每週授課時數皆達三十餘小時之多，同學研究風氣因之可臻於濃厚。</p>
<p>學風方面，過去沉毅質樸，近來則一變爲活潑蓬勃，此半由於時局安定人心向上，牛亦由於學校施政亟謀刷新而致。同學活動能力甚强，各地校友會，學生自治會暨各專門學會等組織均甚見健全，自治會經常出版「英士評論報」，對校務措施建樹不少，各種學會亦各有專門刊物問世，裨益同學寫作機會甚多，他如膳委會，新生招待所，各種遊藝競賽等，概歸同學自理成績斐然。</p>
<p>（五）復員問題</p>
<p>英大是這一次戰爭中苦難的產兒，它先天的不足和命遝的可憐，是無足諱言的。不過，察於全校員生的興校決心與政府創辦英大的最高意義。英大此後之必能欣欣向榮亦母庸置疑。英大此次復員計劃，的可包括三部門：第一，確定通都大邑之地爲永久校址，具建一足够應付全校需要之完備校舍。第二，添設院系，並按實際要求開闢專門性質學科，以完成一完全之大學機構。第三，延聘國內碩學敎授，充實各院系應有設備，使敎學名副其實。上述三項，除第一項懸而未決之外，其他均經學校當局覓具妥善計劃，呈部核准施行。</p>
<p>至於永久校址問題：本來在兩年以前，行政院即決議戰後將其遷往上海或吳興，籍副紀念英士先生出生或殉國之義。後來江浙各地收復，校方即趕派人員前往上述兩地勘察校址；經於上海暫定中法，自然科學研究所等舊址數所爲臨時校舍；並於吳興縣接收日軍營房百餘間。正在呈准上峯擇一而遷之際，不圖敎育部爲分配全國大學敎育網計，忽有將其改遷金華之意。其後杜校長曾代表學生兩度晋謁朱部長，請求維持政院舊議以利英大將來發展等情，當時未經決定，後經陳前部長諸人從中主張，議請行政當局重新考慮後劃定之，是以遷校之舉遂告中。輟茲據某方可靠消息：英大新校址將定吳興或可能暫移上海上課些時云。故本學期校歷延長三星期，寒假特縮短爲一星期，今年六月間即可提前結束：預計英大遷來滬湖後，當有一番新氣象云云。（二月廿七日寄自永嘉）</p>

<h3>復興的曙光</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>革命是國民的天職，不是少數人的專利，官吏是爲人民服務，不是特殊的人物！</p>
<p>這兩點要認識淸楚，就沒有笑話百出，看本月二日報求上所表明的兩大新聞。</p>
<p>（一）美國國務卿演說「不容任何一國，獨覇世界！」</p>
<p>（二）二中全會預備提出，「撲滅官僚主義，剷除官僚資本！」</p>
<p>可見得國人的覺悟，世界也向光明方向努力，此次世界大戰，渡過這長期的黑暗，把世界分成「自由世界」與「統制世界」的兩大璧壘，今納粹已經毀滅了，若仍有用納粹方法想統制世界的人，也可深深地覺悟，這種獨覇的野心，世界人民，也不能容許的！</p>
<p>世界上進步分子，應當循民主思想的正軌而前進，所謂自由平等博愛，三者連繫成爲一體，自從法國大革命，宣布保障人權以後，凡有獨覇野心，想統制世界的人，沒有不遭根本的撲滅，德國威廉第二的雄圖，希特勒的瘋狂暴政，難道現在還有帝國主義存在嗎？盲從呐喊的狂妄分子，也可以自己警惕了！</p>
<p>世界是整個一體，如同身體裏細胞，彼此不可分離，無論任何角落裏，有一部分病痛，都影響及於全體生命的安危，（參觀　著巴山閒話，）誰也不能離開人羣而自存，獨　思想與官僚主義，這二種違背人道的暴力，請他埋葬在納粹墳墓中，復興的曙光，隨鷄鳴而　色了！</p>
<h3>凱歌</h3>
<p>— 于洪</p>
<p>——小城散記</p>
<p>住在淪陷區八年沒有到「裏邊」去，時常覺得很慚愧。但在這種地方住得日子越多，便越對那些作戰於荒野，堅守於名城的鬥士們無限景慕。小的時候在石印本的掌回小說裏讀到一句詩：「鞭敲金　響，齊唱凱歌還」，覺得音節很饗亮，便牢牢的記住了。一直到長大，以至於現在還沒有忘記。</p>
<p>自然這是一種歌頌凱旋的遠征部隊們的字句，甚至說不定在裏面還有點侵略的意味，應用在我們這一次的抗戰也許並不合適。但在這八年中，每次含着淚在屈辱的面前走過，便更對這十個字無限愛好。我自然沒有資格在詩境中經歷，但常想想看一看也是好的。因爲什麼有這種悠望，我自已沒有分晰過，多少也許有一點報復意味在裏面吧？</p>
<p>但這種等待却是很難過的，因爲每天都要在屈辱的面前走過，每天都要在屈辱的面前討生活。實際一點說，是忍受不了亡國的苦味，希望一天勝利的來臨，因爲這句詩代表着勝利，不管是有侵略意味的勝利也罷，還是求生存的勝利也罷，總之牠解除了苦悶的枷鎖，讓我們在屈辱的面前挺起腰來。</p>
<p>也知道要走進詩境裏面還需要更大的艱忍，但有一點奢念，如果看不到鞭敲金鐙的隊伍，和齊唱凱歌的士兵，那麼便祇聽聽這呌做「凱歌」的歌也好。因少常常深夜到一個朋友家去聽他那隱藏着沒有改裝的短波無綫電，由自由小城中傳送過來的是「起來，不願做奴隸的人們」，號召反抗的歌曲，和「大刀向鬼子們的頭上砍去」的沙場進行曲。這些都距離勝利還遙遠，却早爲我熟悉，雖然也不無刺激。但因爲牠們是在屈辱中生長，好像這屈辱總過不完似的。</p>
<p>後來這具無綫電和朋友一同進了「憲兵隊」，便祗能在當地的播音器中呼到此「我歌唱，我飛翔……」故做愉快的歌曲，和「花是將開的紅，人是未婚的好」之類的糜爛的調子。我是一個沒有音樂感的人，所以聽起歌曲來，不過是　氣的對於「　歌」的迷惑。</p>
<p>幾年來爲生活而漂泊，雖然未必「」，却更　到做奴隸的苦味。一點點精科上的安慰，已不足以癒暫時之創了。因之盼勝利愈切，甚至有了陸放翁「王師北定中原日，家祭無忘吿乃翁」的心情。這期待勝利的心，比臘月裏的孩子期待新年還要殷切。</p>
<p>一睡醒來，勝利悄悄的到了，還不太敢相信，疑惑或許在做夢，但的的確確是千眞萬確，於是又勾引起那句老詞：「　敵金　響，齊唱凱歌還。」這好像是太容易實現的願望，每天到街上去等國軍，好難等呀，好難，好難。一天兩火三天四天，數不過來了，却終於等來了。</p>
<p>我祇是報吿在我們那小小的地方的情况，國軍邁着莊嚴的步子走過去；大家「萬歲呀，萬歲！」大聲的歡呼，有三兩匹馬，沒有歌，並不是沒有了歌處便對國軍减少了熱愛，祇是覺得好像少了一點什麼東西，好像是一個夢，還沒有做完。</p>
<h3>老宅</h3>
<p>— 蕭羣</p>
<p>我又來到了這地方，收不知道是我自己突然老下了呢還是別的改變得太快了，我很難相信自已的眼睛，我們那個老宅突然低矮得多，門牆失去了光澤，白　粉剝落掉留着斑斑漬痕，一切變得灰黯破落，這裏像荒凉了好多年，它的主人又像離開此地長久長久一任其傾圮着。</p>
<p>我看見好多陌生的面孔，他們似乎並不會注意到我，院落裏堆着木柴，炭屑，枯樹枝子散開一地，大人們坐在廊簷下魄太陽或者縫着點什麼，小孩子滿處跑着，跌倒了於是哇哇哇嚎哭着，另一些揑着粉筆頭在門板上畫着一些拙劣的花紋，大門樓在往常是一年到頭緊緊閉着的現在却大敞着，偶而有搖着小鼓買針綫擔子的走過，停止了脚步；良久睇視着，他們的眼光裏是含着幾許驚訝，他們會想：</p>
<p>「咦，這宅子的主人才過世不久，怎麼會變成這麼樣呀！」</p>
<p>隨着又提起脚步搖着小鼓叮鼕鼕走遠了。</p>
<p>後來誰發現了我，搖着顫萎萎的步子走過來，用昏黃的眼睛向我從頭看到脚。</p>
<p>「你不就是二少爺嗎？」</p>
<p>「嗯。」</p>
<p>「你可回來啦！」</p>
<p>我的腳前有許多　鷄搶着食，老者驅趕開去又聚攏來。</p>
<p>「你看，眞不像話啦，偌大的院子糟蹋成什麽樣。」</p>
<p>我用着陌生的眼色向周遭望着，隨後我低下頭，我不敢想，小時候我是在這裏長大的，那會玻璃窗常是擦得明浄透亮，樑柱也漆得紅紅發光，……有一股濃烈的情感緊緊　制住我，鼻子一酸我想哭，但我終於勉强忍住了，我轉頭問老者：</p>
<p>「你一直在這裏？」</p>
<p>「可不是，人老了，動彈不得了　，這宅子裏的事我也看得太多了，少爺，你不記得小時候你老纏住要我搶。……」</p>
<p>我點頭向他作了個苦笑老者又說下云：</p>
<p>「眞想不到事情就會變得那麼快，要說這宅子當年造的時候，我也親眼看見的，誰料得到，多少年一過，就敗壞成這樣子，你看見前面那些住家的嗎？簡直不像話，就像個大雜院呢，要是老爺曉得有這麼一天，還不知要傷心成什麼樣子呢。」</p>
<p>我們的腳步悖悖朝後園移動，像發現奇蹟似地，我看見一株迎春柳依舊牽爬在牆杞上，今年冬天不很冷，年一過已經有黃色的花蕊茁長出來我感到一點喜悅，我順手摘下一枝，朝　管裏嗅着，老者在枯　的臉上掠過一絲笑。</p>
<p>「祗有這株迎春柳，還活着，二少爺，你不要？你住在那裏？趕快兒我給你稍上云。」</p>
<p>可是我搖搖頭，我　然地又離開那古老的宅第。</p>
<h3>馬兒和「馬兒」的對話</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>——街頭散曲之一</p>
<p>有一天——</p>
<p>一輛馬車和一輛包車同時停留在一個地方；</p>
<p>馬兒把車夫望了一眼，</p>
<p>車夫也把馬兒望了一眼。</p>
<p>馬兒對車夫開口了：</p>
<p>（眼睛裏畫着一個問號）</p>
<p>「我是一匹馬呀，不能不把向己的肩背</p>
<p>給人們當成大路走！</p>
<p>而你呢？——</p>
<p>却是一個不折不扣的人呵！」</p>
<p>車夫把頭埀下了：</p>
<p>（臉上浮起一絲苦笑）</p>
<p>「請不要奉承我吧，</p>
<p>我那裏是一個人呢？</p>
<p>你知道，我正跟你同樣，</p>
<p>也是一匹馬呀！</p>
<p>不同的祗是——</p>
<p>你長着四支脚，</p>
<p>而我呢？——</p>
<p>却砥有一雙！」</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（十八）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>麗雲的模樣兒本來很俊，可惜有一年出天花，臉上落下了一些散碎的麻子。這孩子比　華天眞，活潑，也倔强些。小心眼裏只知道昏昏沌沌玩兒，玩兒以外的事情，她毫不感興趣。因爲生得不似翁二太太的美貌，而脾氣勝過翁二太太，只要有一點兒不如意，她就會哭鬧個不休。所以翁二太太不太喜歡她，一切唯有任着她的性兒。自然，翁老爺也無暇去教育她，翁老爺對於麗華和對於其它的事一樣，看得很淡。倒是墨太太比較她的父母愛護她，也許因爲墨太太在自己的孩干牙上，得不到安慰的原故，她想從別人的孩子身上換取感情。而且在墨太太的意識裏，翁二太太的女兒也正如自己的女兒是一樣。</p>
<p>翁老爺這幾年來，烟癮愈發地大了，白天睡覺，夜裏吸烟，使得翁二太太仍然過着宛如七年前的孤獨生活，而且日子也已經不堪維持了！翁二太太經手購置的一些田地，都給翁老爺賣掉了。如今只剩下一座房子，翁老爺還算計着，這房子的代價，可以够吸一年的烟。</p>
<p>翁二太太恨得咬牙切齒，常常駡翁老爺：「你怎麼不死呢？你死了我倒安怡些。」可是翁老爺喜皮涎臉地吿訴她：「我死了你就要作寡婦了！」翁二太太却毫不以爲然！翁二太太現在還不就等於是寡婦？而且翁二太太有時想：索興是寡婦倒自由些，如今有翁老爺活着，她總不好這樣去嫁人，儘管她已經起了這個念頭。</p>
<p>其實，翁家的破產，並不全是翁老爺一個人敗壞的，翁二太太也有責任。她雖不吸烟，可是，她的消耗也相當可觀。比如她修飾；她愛玩兒；她講究吃喝；這一切的化費也不在翁老爺之下。自然，她的理由是苦悶，所以她需要在生活的各方面找消遣，求寄托。</p>

<h3>Zou Lu, Bai Chongxi, Wang Zhengting, and Others Demand a Change in Diplomatic Style; Atmosphere at the Plenary Session is Tragic, Indignant, and Exhilarating</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The Fifth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee was held at 3:15 PM on the 5th. 220 committee members were in attendance, presided over by Committee Member He Yingqin. Following the standard procedure of the secretariat reading the minutes of the Fourth Plenary Session, the Chairman announced that Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie would present a diplomatic report, which lasted one and a half hours. After a ten-minute recess, the meeting continued to review the diplomatic report. Committee members Zou Lu, Bai Chongxi, Wang Zhengting, Song Yishan, Hu Qiuyuan, Gu Zheng, and others spoke, all pointing out the errors of secret diplomacy and the urgent need to change the diplomatic style. During the review, the atmosphere at the meeting was tragic, indignant, and exhilarating. The speeches of Zou Lu, Bai Chongxi, and Wang Zhengting were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Minister Wang delivered an oral report on recent diplomatic work at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee on the afternoon of the 5th. The report covered the United Nations organization, the control of Japan, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and the issue of receiving the Northeast, the Vietnam issue, and the issue of protecting overseas Chinese. (1) When reporting on the United Nations organization, Minister Wang said: "The current international situation is extremely unstable, partly due to the lack of full coordination among the major powers in the United Nations, partly due to the emergence of new weapons (the atomic bomb), and especially because of the weakness of the existing United Nations organization. The weakness of the existing United Nations organization is due to the extensive veto power held by the permanent members of the Security Council. However, the instability of the international situation may create a universal demand to strengthen the United Nations organization. Although we are not satisfied with the current state of the United Nations organization, we must pay attention to its future development." (2) Regarding the issue of Japanese control, Minister Wang said: "The Far Eastern Commission and the Four-Power Control Commission, recently agreed upon by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, are a compromise based on the original proposals of the US and Soviet governments. The Chinese government proposed a similar compromise plan in November last year." When discussing the issue of Japanese reparations to the Allied countries, the Minister solemnly stated: "China has been at war the longest and has suffered the greatest losses. Therefore, in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, and in the negotiations for receiving the Northeast, Minister Wang presented a report to the General Assembly today. Minister Wang said: "The withdrawal of Soviet troops was originally scheduled to be completed before December 3rd of last year, which is three months from the day of Japan's surrender (September 2nd), in accordance with the deadline for Soviet troop withdrawal stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Agreement. Later, due to the issue of our troops landing in Dalian, no agreement was reached between China and the Soviet Union, and irregular armed forces threatened our receiving personnel in Changchun, Shenyang, and other places, leading to setbacks in the reception. Later, after two rounds of discussions between China and the Soviet Union, it was agreed that February 1st of this year would be the deadline for the completion of the Soviet troop withdrawal from the Northeast. Now that the deadline has passed, the Soviet troops have not yet withdrawn. According to the Soviet side, the delay in the withdrawal of Soviet troops is due to technical difficulties. Our government is currently continuing to urge the Soviet side. In January of this year, the Soviet government made a statement to our government stating that Japanese enterprises in the Northeastern provinces that had served the Kwantung Army should be regarded as Soviet war spoils. Our side believes that all public and private properties of Japanese in China should be regarded as part of Japan's reparations to China, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, the views of China and the Soviet Union on this issue have not yet been consistent. However, the withdrawal of Soviet troops, according to the agreement, does not come with any conditions. Therefore, the existence of this dispute should not constitute the reason for the Soviet Union to delay its withdrawal. Sino-Soviet amity, as the President of our Party said, is not only needed by China and the Soviet Union, but also required for the peace and security of the entire world. I deeply hope that both sides will act in the spirit of amity and friendship to quickly resolve the issue of Soviet troop withdrawal." (4) Finally, Minister Wang explained in detail the issue of our army's withdrawal from Vietnam, and gave a brief report on the new agreements China has recently signed with countries in Central and South America, Thailand, and the Netherlands to protect overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Strict Review of Financial, Monetary, and Economic Measures by Various Committee Members; Attention Focused on Gold, Materials, and Other Items</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee was held at 9:15 AM on the 5th. Two hundred and thirty committee members, including Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Ji, Song Ziwen, and Chiang Song Meiling, were in attendance, with Committee Member Sun Ke as the chair. Following the standard procedure of the secretariat continuing to read the minutes of the third meeting and the reporting documents, the Chairman announced the continuation of the review of the financial, monetary, and economic problems reports. There was an extremely enthusiastic response, with a total of 21 oral inquiries and 2 written inquiries. Committee members believed that the Party's principles and political program and policies were extremely correct, but the execution by the responsible agencies was often unsatisfactory, causing the people to have many complaints about the Party. Therefore, based on their observations, they conducted a strict review of various financial, monetary, and economic policies. This courageous and responsible attitude truly demonstrated the Party's spirit of innovation. After the committee members spoke, there were proposals that the General Assembly should not accept the report of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and that the General Assembly should exercise its power of dismissal. There were also proposals to establish a "Committee for the Inventory of Enemy and Puppet Industry Materials". The first two proposals were not passed because the General Assembly had no such provisions, while the latter proposal was announced by the Chairman to be referred to the review committee. Immediately afterwards, the Chairman announced (1) the list of members of the Review Committee for Financial, Monetary, and Economic Issues, with Liu Jianqun, Liu Wen, and Zhao Ping as conveners; (2) the list of members of the Drafting Committee for the General Assembly Declaration, with Sun Ke, Wang Shijie, and Chen Bulei as conveners. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM. The opinions of the committee members on the financial, monetary, and economic problems report are briefly described below:</p>
<p>[] The reasons for the failure of economic measures: (1) Neglecting the Principle of People's Livelihood and cultivating official capital. (2) The failure of economic controls during the War of Resistance. (3) Allowing private industries to survive or perish on their own, without paying attention. (4) Heavy industry almost completely stopped. (5) No effective relief measures for unemployed workers. (6) Many of the personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take over were quite derelict. (7) There was no adjustment plan for the surplus or deficit of materials in various places, and there were no appropriate measures to deal with rising prices. (8) No report or plan was heard regarding the post-war economic policy.</p>
<p>[] Production is low, people's livelihood is declining, inflation is rampant, prices are soaring, people are suffering deeply, and the lives of public teachers and soldiers are difficult. This situation can be used to describe administrative efficiency. Factories in the rear have closed down, and most of the factories taken over in the recovered areas have not started operating. The entire economic system is in a state of anarchy. All measures are contrary to the Principle of People's Livelihood. Those who implement the policies should be held responsible. He also explained the meaning of "bureaucratic capital" and requested the separation of officials and merchants and the registration of assets of officials and historians.</p>
<p>[Dai Kuaishi] The Ministry of Finance should pay attention to overseas remittances and should calculate according to the selling price of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>[Ren Xuan] The reports of the Ministries of Finance and Economics both failed to implement Articles 4 and 10 of the Principle of People's Livelihood Political Program as resolved by the Sixth National Congress. Article 4 of the Political Program stipulates that urban land should be owned by the public, and that farmland, except for those operated by the public, should be implemented with the most rapid and effective method of "land to the tillers". All land that is not self-cultivated should be gradually purchased by the state through the issuance of land bonds and then distributed. Article 10 stipulates the registration and restriction of the assets of officials at all levels and personnel of public enterprises, and the thorough implementation of the regulations that officials at all levels are not allowed to engage in commerce. However, the Executive Yuan only annotated this important political program with the word "should be done" and there was no implementation. This kind of bureaucratic style must be reformed.</p>
<p>[Lu Dangping] Please announce the figures for gold trading.</p>
<p>[Peng Zhaoxian] The finance departments of various provinces cannot intervene in land tax revenue and finance and have nothing to do, while the organization of the Land Grain Management Office is too large. This system must be improved. Some tax collection agencies in various provinces do not have enough total income to maintain the operating expenses of the agency. Some tax collections are too harsh. All of this should be thoroughly reorganized. There is no fixed standard for inheritance tax and land tax, and tax rates should also be set.</p>
<p>[Luo Shishi] (1) Regarding the gold policy, what are the gains and losses of the government and the people? (2) Is the establishment of state-run textile companies a solution to the "clothing" problem of the Principle of People's Livelihood? Later, it was announced that state-run companies would be handed over to private ownership after three years. Has this shaken the belief in the Principle of People's Livelihood?</p>
<p>[Liu Weichi] The difference between budget revenue and expenditure is very large. Is it still relying on inflation or are there other ways to make up for it? The foreign exchange fund is limited, so exports must be encouraged and overseas remittances must be used to maintain it for a long time.</p>
<p>[Wu Zhiren] The most serious and difficult economic problem to solve is bureaucratic capital. The Ministry of Economic Affairs should announce the names of bureaucratic capitalists and list them as targets of the revolution. The economic, financial, diplomatic, and transportation sectors should cooperate to solve the current economic and financial problems.</p>
<p>[Zhou Bomin] (1) The salt problem of thousands of millions of people in Guizhou is quite serious. There is a salt shortage everywhere due to the increase in salt prices. The salt prices in various parts of the province also differ greatly. Is it a loss of popular support to increase the selling price of this indispensable food for the people? (2) The suspension of cotton loans in Shaanxi has made it impossible for the people in the cotton-producing areas to maintain production, which is tantamount to encouraging the import of foreign cotton. Is this an economic policy?</p>
<p>[Wu Shaoshu] (1) Prices are soaring everywhere. Some people think that it is due to a lack of materials. Therefore, in Shanghai, they asked the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau established by the Executive Yuan to open warehouses and bid for materials to increase supply. However, who purchased the materials after the bidding, and have they been supplied to the market? This must be investigated. (2) The products of the China Textile Company are priced even higher than the black market. Therefore, there is a slogan in Shanghai that "China Textile" is leading the price increase. (3) Should public officials receive the same treatment? Why do senior officials of the China Textile Company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company receive special treatment? (4) Does the Executive Yuan have a solution to the current problems? If there is no solution, it should resign to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Zheng Yitong] (1) The financial powers and responsibilities of the central and local governments should be divided. (2) After the foreign exchange is opened, attention should be paid to a source of continuous supply to avoid creating a black market again. The operating personnel should be strictly disciplined. (3) There should be an overall plan for receiving and using enemy and puppet materials. (4) State-run and private-run companies should be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>[Wu Tiecheng] (1) Before the war, the small accounts of various banks were mostly transferred to the United States during the war, in addition to investments and loans. At that time, 10,000 legal currency could purchase 3,000 US dollars. Now, when repaying depositors, 10,000 legal currency is only worth 5 US dollars. Another method should be formulated to prevent small depositors from suffering losses. The United States announced that the deposits of Chinese people in the United States amounted to 356 million US dollars, most of which were deposits of various banks in our country. (2) The Enemy and Puppet Property Bureau should quickly supply the market at par to adjust market prices. (3) State-run economic enterprises mostly fail and are criticized as bureaucratic capital. Why not hand over industries necessary for people's livelihood to private ownership?</p>
<p>[Zhang Jiuru] (1) How should enemy and puppet factories be operated? There are as many as 170,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai's first district, and there are still 80,000 now. The Ministry of Economic Affairs should immediately organize a liquidation committee to liquidate and announce the enemy and puppet materials received. (2) What is the result of the gold policy? What is the situation of legal currency being withdrawn? Will the gold policy continue to be implemented in the future? What is the situation of gold flowing out of the country? (3) If foreign exchange management is not effective, the banks that handle foreign exchange will manipulate foreign exchange. Does the Ministry of Finance have measures to ban it? Luxury goods should be banned from import to avoid checking foreign exchange and creating a black market. (4) After the provinces exempt land tax, the local governments are helpless and have to use the method of apportionment, which increases the burden on the people. This is related to the safety of society and the country. Is the financial authority paying attention?</p>
<p>[Hu Ying] There should be a clearer report on finance and finance.</p>
<p>[Yu Wangde] The increase in foreign exchange prices will affect legitimate uses, such as the cost of studying abroad.</p>
<p>[Liu Jianqun] At present, in terms of "goods", industry is declining and the economy is exhausted. In terms of "people", officials are not happy and people are suffering. This seriousness should not be ignored. The competent authorities should tell the solution, or think it out if they don't have it, and pick it up if they have it, and put it down if they don't have it, and advocate the establishment of another economic team to study countermeasures.</p>
<p>[Huang Xuchu] The salaries stipulated for the provincial security team are not even half of the food expenses. The treatment of provincial civil servants is too low, and the mining control measures should be revised.</p>
<p>[Luo Xiatian] Advocate being pragmatic, putting forward current problems, and earnestly seeking solutions, instead of being perfunctory and hoping that there will be no problems. In addition, we should also pay close attention to improving the many conflicts between the central government's policies and the actual situation in various localities.</p>
<p>[Zhang Banghan] The treatment of civil servants and the army is not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. I hope that the financial authorities will budget according to income and make overall arrangements.</p>
<p>[Pan Gongzhan] Written inquiry: Should the treatment of civil servants be equal and should it be increased equally? Is the special treatment of senior officials of the China Textile Company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company true?</p>
<p>[Wen Yiyou, Lei Zhen] Written inquiry: Please reply in writing from the Ministry of Finance: (1) The use of the two currency stabilization funds. (2) Before the opening of foreign exchange, the detailed amount of foreign exchange supplied by the government over the years, as well as the names of the applicants and their uses. (3) The amount of foreign exchange earned by the government during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>[Wu Jingheng] Summarizing the opinions of the committee members, they are nothing more than reviewing the four issues of legal currency, gold, foreign exchange, and materials. However, legal currency is issued by the government. If there is no way to deal with legal currency, then everything cannot be discussed. Legal currency can be issued at will, but gold is ultimately limited. Minister Weng said that to save prices, everyone should have a conscience, but those who buy foreign exchange and buy gold have no conscience at all, and they help prices rise. Gold and foreign exchange are like "robbers", assassinating legal currency. If they cannot be controlled, these two "robbers" will inevitably kill legal currency. If the government cannot maintain credit, then all legal currency and new currency will be useless. Therefore, he specifically put forward the slogan "Save the Legal Currency".</p>
<h3>Repairs to the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways to Begin Immediately; Ling Hongxun to Go to North China Again to Supervise Repairs</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] According to transportation circles, the uncertain repair work on the Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways has been revised due to Ma, Zhang, and Zhou's views on the joint control of transportation by the Communist troops in Shandong Province. The road repair work can begin within days. Once some of the railway equipment that has already arrived in Shanghai is transferred to Xuzhou and Jinan, it is hoped that the repair work can be completed mostly within a month. It is reported that Vice Minister Ling Hongxun will soon go to North China again to supervise repairs.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 4th] The entire territory of Shandong is generally calm due to the arrival of Zhang, Zhou, and Ma. Both sides agreed to do their best to restore transportation first.

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 4th] It is reported that the important agreements reached by Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai in Xuzhou are: (1) The government and the Communist army both agree to restore transportation and will start road repairs immediately. (2) Remove all obstacles on the transportation lines. (3) The Zaozhuang coal mine will resume operation immediately, and a mining area production committee will be formed to supervise the implementation. It can be implemented after the two committee members Zhang and Zhou return to Chongqing.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Has the Right to Go to the Northeast</h3>
<p>Bernes Receives Reporters, Saying</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: US Secretary of State Bernes received reporters today. One reporter asked about the situation in Manchuria. He replied that the Supreme Command of the Allied Forces, headed by Commander MacArthur, could extend to any location where enemy forces had been found. Since the governments of the countries participating in the war against Japan had recognized MacArthur as the Supreme Commander, MacArthur should have the right to go to the Northeast (as long as MacArthur himself is willing to go to Manchuria). Mr. Bernes refused to comment on the Soviet Union sending Japanese prisoners to the interior, but pointed out that the Potsdam Declaration stipulated that Japanese troops who surrendered must be sent back to their home country.</p>

<h3>US Asks for Report on Soviet Transportation of Industrial Equipment; Soviet Troops in Northeast to Hold Combat Exercises</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] State Department officials announced today that the United States has asked China and the Soviet Union to provide a report on the Soviet army's transportation of industrial equipment from the nine northeastern provinces of China.

Our military delegation has received notification of this matter, but the notification did not specify the date of the exercises. It is reported that Soviet troops in Harbin, Dalian, and other places have also held such exercises. In addition, the financial market in Harbin has been very chaotic recently, and the financial situation is very tight. Several commercial banks have requested assistance from the central bank. The reasons for this are perhaps very complex, but according to those who understand the inside story, the Soviet Grain Trade Society in Harbin recently stopped purchasing grain in the area. Before, the advance payments paid to the grain merchants have all been recovered, so deposit withdrawals have occurred in various banks.

<h3>Churchill Says in US Speech That a New War Crisis Is Lurking</h3>
<p>The Dark Ages Could Return; Victory Is Shrouded in Shadow; Western Democratic Countries Should Unite</p>
<p>[Reuters, Fulton, Missouri, 5th] British wartime Prime Minister Churchill, in a speech at Westminster College here today, said: If the English-speaking peoples cannot unite in a spirit of brotherhood, it will still be difficult to prevent war or promote the organization of world institutions. The United Kingdom and the United States must not only maintain a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding, but also maintain close relations between their military advisors to study the lurking crisis, and then they can cultivate a spirit of brotherhood. It is also necessary to jointly use all the naval and air bases of the two countries around the world to ensure mutual security. The Dark Ages can return; good times do not last; the victory of the Allies is now shrouded in shadow; we should be vigilant.</p>
<p>Churchill went on to suggest that the United Nations organization should have its own military organization: This can be done gradually, but it must be implemented immediately, inviting countries to contribute several squadrons of air force to serve the world organization. If the secret of the atomic bomb is now told to the United Nations organization, it will be a mistake, because the world's atmosphere is still not calm. If the United Kingdom and the United States can unite in a spirit of brotherhood as I have said, they can prevent problems before they occur and lay the foundation for peace. Only by maintaining a special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States can the world organization have its position and produce strength.</p>
<h3>Does Not Believe the Soviets Want War, but Want to Expand Power Without Restriction</h3>
<p>Churchill then strongly advocated the Anglo-Soviet Treaty: I deeply admire the courage and perseverance of the Russian people and Comrade Stalin. The United Kingdom still sympathizes with and treats the entire Russian nation with goodwill and will always maintain permanent friendship with it. The ancient countries of Central and Eastern Europe are now within the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. However, glorious Athens will make a decision on its future elections under the observation of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The Polish government's current actions against Germany are quite inappropriate. The Communist parties in the countries of Eastern Europe are originally in the minority. Their current prominence may not be able to take on the responsibilities and want to strive for totalitarian rule. At present, except for Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy to speak of. The Soviet Union's oppression of Turkey and the situation of the Russian Communist Party within Germany are not what we want to see in the post-liberation reconstruction of Europe, nor are they sufficient to constitute the elements of lasting peace. All of this makes me feel that a new war is inevitable. But I am sure that the future can be decided by us, and we have the power to save the future. Therefore, out of a sense of responsibility, I speak frankly, but I do not believe that the Soviet Union wants war. What it expects is the result of war and the unrestricted expansion of its power and doctrine. What is urgently needed now is a solution. The longer we delay, the more dreams we will have at night, and the crisis will deepen. It is no longer an era of striving for equal power. If Western democratic countries can unite and abide by the Charter of the United Nations, their strength can promote this principle. In this year of 1946, we can reach this goal by seeking all goodwill and understanding with the Soviet Union through the authority of the United Nations. The English-speaking peoples, united and abiding by the Charter, move forward and can stabilize the future world situation.</p>

<h3>Urge the Spanish People to Determine Their Own Destiny; Overthrow the Franco Government; Joint Declaration by Three Countries Published Yesterday; UK Does Not Agree to Refer the Spanish Issue to the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 5th, broadcast that after the United Kingdom, France, and the United States issued a joint declaration on Franco, Washington officials believed that only the Spanish army has sufficient power to overthrow the Franco regime. The new government proposed by the three-country declaration could not be established because there is no political party with sufficient power in Spain at present.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] Government officials said today that France had sent a message to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union last week, proposing that the issue of the Spanish Franco regime be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for disposal. The British government has refused this, on the grounds that replacing Franco is a matter for the Spanish people, and "external forces" would only strengthen Franco's position.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] The governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France issued a joint declaration on Spain this evening, stating that the destiny of Spain should be decided by the Spanish people themselves. The Franco government had received assistance from Nazi and Fascist countries, so as long as Franco exists, the Spanish people will not be able to establish normal relations with the countries that defeated Nazism and Fascism. We have no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of Spain. The Spanish people should decide their own destiny. Although the Franco government has taken coercive measures against the political aspirations of the Spanish people, we still hope that their people will not suffer the horrors and pain of civil war again. On the contrary, we hope that enlightened Spanish people can quickly find various ways to make Franco retire peacefully, dissolve the Falange, and establish a provisional government, so as to give the Spanish people the opportunity to freely decide their government and choose their leaders. Amnesty for political prisoners, the return of exiled Spanish people, freedom of assembly and political association, and the enactment of public election laws are all important tasks. If the provisional government can gain the recognition and support of all freedom-loving people, it will devote itself to this goal and remain unwavering. Under these circumstances, we will immediately establish diplomatic relations with Spain and will assist it in solving various economic problems, because these problems cannot be solved at present. As for the severance or maintenance of diplomatic relations with the Franco regime, this is a major issue that must be considered in light of the overall situation and the efforts of the Spanish people to strive for freedom before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] Regarding Franco's wartime relations with the Axis powers, the US military seized a large number of files in Germany. After experts from the State Department studied them separately, they were released today, proving that if the Axis powers had recognized Spain's demands for Gibraltar, Tangier, French Morocco, and part of Algeria, Franco would have abandoned neutrality and joined the Axis powers.</p>
<h3>Shidehara Hurriedly Enters the Palace; Japanese Cabinet Encounters a Crisis; Held a Meeting Yesterday Morning and Did Not Disperse Until Evening; It Is Said That MacArthur Will Continue to Order the Purge of Certain People</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] According to Kyodo News Agency: The Japanese cabinet held an important meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence from 10 AM this morning and discussed it all day. At 6 PM, Prime Minister Shidehara and Matsumoto, chairman of the Cabinet's Constitutional Revision Committee, hurriedly entered the palace to meet with the Japanese Emperor. They had not returned to the residence by 8 PM at night. The cabinet members waited quietly and did not disperse, so that they could continue the meeting at night. The agency also reported that Foreign Minister Yoshida had recently met with MacArthur, but according to Colonel Wheeler, military secretary of MacArthur's headquarters, Yoshida did not meet with MacArthur, nor was an audience scheduled. After the news came out, the Japanese immediately speculated that MacArthur would continue to announce that certain people, also as militarists, must be purged, and perhaps there are such people in the cabinet, so the cabinet has encountered a crisis. Some said that Matsumoto's entry into the palace proves that the cabinet meeting is related to the revision of the constitution. Others predicted that some cabinet members would resign after the cabinet meeting, but Kyodo News Agency said that the cabinet would not resign collectively. Japanese newspapers reported that the revision of the constitution seems to have stalled on the issue of the emperor's power. Rumor has it that MacArthur's headquarters is quite dissatisfied with the original draft of the revision of the constitution by the Japanese cabinet, so it is now drafting a new draft.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] Former Japanese Diet member Yukio Ozaki today submitted a draft constitutional revision plan to the cabinet. He advocated adopting the British constitutional monarchy system. According to his plan, the Japanese Emperor's power would be reduced, and the Japanese Emperor's activities would be limited to approving laws, convening parliament, appointing officials, awarding honors, and concluding treaties, but subject to the approval of parliament.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Atomic Espionage Case: Canadian Government Releases Investigation Report; Soviet Embassy Masterminded the Spying, Encompassing Four Areas</h3>
<p>[United Press Ottawa, 4th] Canadian Prime Minister King today released the results of the atomic bomb espionage case investigation. It is stated that after the Canadian government cracked the atomic secrets leak case, it appointed two judges to be responsible for the investigation. The investigation team has now submitted a report. Based on various pieces of evidence, this espionage activity was indeed carried out by personnel from the Soviet Embassy in Canada, acting on direct instructions from Moscow. These Soviet personnel received secret orders from Moscow around August of last year, near the end of the Pacific War, to find ways to spy on intelligence regarding the transfer of American troops from Europe to the United States and to the Pacific. The addresses of the U.S. Ninth Army and more than twenty other divisions and corps headquarters were also secretly investigated and reported. The person in charge of the operation in Ottawa was Colonel Zabotin, the military attaché of the Soviet Embassy.</p>
<p>Zabotin was ordered to spy on the following areas: (1) Details regarding the raw materials of the atomic bomb, its manufacturing techniques, procedures, and blueprints. (2) Details of the atomic bombs used by the United States Navy. (3) Samples of Uranium-235 and details of its manufacturing plant. (4) The location of the Brazilian infantry division (fighting in Italy) and details of Canadian divisions that had returned home.</p>
<p>According to a recent announcement from Moscow, Zabotin was recalled to his home country from Ottawa in mid-December. The report also announced that the following four people violated the Canadian Secrets Act by directly or indirectly leaking secret and confidential information to the Soviet Union: Mrs. Mathilde Carré, a code clerk in the Department of External Affairs, who disclosed the content of a secret telegram to Soviet personnel; Captain Leonard Burt Nantais, an officer in the Canadian intelligence bureau, who was the leader of the espionage ring, directly reporting to Lieutenant Colonel Motolov, the deputy military attaché of the Soviet Embassy; Mr. Durnford, an electrical engineer at the National Research Council, who originally worked on radar and was one of Nantais' spies, disclosed two reports from the research council regarding a certain radar development; and Mrs. Emma Woikin, an acting registrar at the British High Commission, whose position allowed her access to all the commission's secret documents, disclosed the contents of several secret documents.</p>
<p>The report also stated that there were many other very active spies, and that substantially more important intelligence had been leaked. However, because sufficient evidence had not yet been collected, no details could be released at this time.</p>
<p>(Further dispatch) The report also listed four defendants accused of assisting the Soviet Union in spying on secrets. After being tried in court, they were ordered to be remanded in custody until the continuation of the trial on March 11. Of the four defendants, only Mrs. Woikin pleaded guilty.</p>

<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>Suzhou: Power Plant Lacks Coal, Entire Suzhou Experiences Power Outage</p>
<p>The Suzhou power plant previously faced a coal shortage, causing it to suspend daytime power supply, and even nighttime power supply was cut off by 12 o'clock. A few days ago, it sent personnel to the Shanghai Fuel Committee to apply for an allocation of 700 tons of coal. As of last night, the coal had not yet arrived in Suzhou. The plant only had a remaining ten tons or so of coal, borrowed from the Ministry of Military Affairs' warehouse. Furthermore, the culm coal ordered by the plant from the Xishan Baoshan Company could not be delivered due to continuous rainy weather and the inability of ships to sail. As a result, the electricity was cut off last night (the 2nd). In order to prevent accidents, the authorities closed the city gates earlier yesterday.</p>
<p>Qingpu: Petty Traitor Ma Jiwu Arrested</p>
<p>Ma Jiwu, who successively served as the vice chairman of the maintenance association in the third district of the county, Zhangyan Township, and as a lieutenant colonel and adjutant in Yuan Yingjie's puppet 5th regiment, as well as the director of the regiment's training office during the puppet regime era, was reported to the county government. County Magistrate Liu ordered the town's police to arrest him and bring him to Qingpu for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Bengbu: Disaster Situation in Anhui-Jiangsu Border Region is Dire</p>
<p>During the period of occupation, the people in the border region of northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu had already suffered greatly. After the victory, the Communist army occupied Fengyang, Lingbi, Suxian, Wuhe, Xuyi, and Xiaoxian, Tongshan, Suining, and Huaiyin in northern Jiangsu, arbitrarily harassing the population. Coupled with rampant floods, droughts, locusts, and epidemics, the people were struggling to survive. After inspecting and investigating the situation, Mr. James of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration stated that 4 million people lacked clothing and food, and the disaster had almost reached a serious stage. The able-bodied disaster victims in the areas occupied by the Communist army in the Anhui-Jiangsu border region have fled to Xuzhou and Bengbu, where approximately 100,000 people live a life of begging.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Refusing to Use Puppet Currency, Improving Exchange</p>

The money will be remitted to the Farmers Bank for exchange, and the Chamber of Commerce will exchange it for legal tender seven days later, collecting the receipt. However, this is a trial, and the initial amount is set at 20 million yuan in legal tender. If the results are good, it will continue. The county bank in this county has also started exchanging puppet currency. The method is for businesses to deposit puppet currency into the bank, open an account, and receive legal tender ten days later, but without interest.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: County Government Restricts Outflow of Rice and Grain</p>
<p>The Jiaxing County Rice Industry Association believes that although the authorities have restricted the sale price of rice in Hangzhou, there is still a black market. Therefore, rice peddlers from southern Jiangsu are selling rice out of Jiaxing to seek profits. Moreover, the provincial government is purchasing large quantities of rice from Jiaxing to relieve the food shortage in Hangzhou, making it difficult for rice prices in Jiaxing to fall. In order to ensure the food supply for the people, the Rice Industry Association decided at a board meeting a few days ago to request that the county government order the police at the train station to carefully inspect and prohibit the carrying of more than one picul of rice out of the county.</p>
<p>Ningbo: Properly Planning to Resolve the Food Shortage</p>

(5) Expand the distribution of porridge to relieve the poor. (6) Request the provincial government and the Grain Administration Bureau to approve the allocation of grain from the Lingmiao warehouse to this county.</p>

<h3>American Journalist Reveals the Inside Story of Actions in the Northeast: Soviet Army Speeding up the Construction of Ordnance Factories</h3>
<p>— By Dickson, Northeast Correspondent for the "Stars and Stripes," Translated by Our News Research Office</p>
<p>The stubborn and arrogant Soviet army, emboldened by the victory in this war, believes that the war is not yet over and is now speeding up the construction of a massive ordnance factory in the Northeast. In this key corner of Asia, they are strengthening their military and political base.</p>
<p>In this newly occupied zone by the Soviet army, the terrifying Soviet secret police are creating all kinds of terror. In the strategic strongholds of Dalian and Lushun, the Soviet army is conducting military exercises.</p>
<p>From Harbin to Dalian, the Soviet army has almost completed the work of looting factories to establish the strength of the Soviet military industry. According to reliable sources, if northern China were to become a battlefield, there would be no factories in the area that could be used by the enemy.</p>
<p>In this industrially developed area, non-partisan citizens, when talking about their lives under Soviet rule, say, "It's actually worse than under the Nazi rule. The rampant terror is even worse than under the Japanese."</p>
<p>Impatient journalists finally uncovered the mysterious curtain of the Soviet army's actions in Northeast China. These journalists believe that the Soviet army should not have forbidden the publication of this news of world importance. They rushed into Shenyang and ventured into every remote corner of the Northeast, becoming uninvited guests.</p>
<p>Ignoring the repeated detentions, expulsions, arrests, and insults by the Soviet secret police wearing the NKVD insignia, these journalists still sneaked into Shenyang, Changchun, and Dalian. They have gathered enough news to serve as evidence that the Soviet army is indeed using force to gain a new foothold in Asia.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese army, the Soviet army clearly intends to stay in the Northeast for a long time. Marshal Malinovsky, the commander of the Soviet Far East Army, made this very clear in his speech commemorating Red Army Day in Changchun.</p>
<h3>"If Anyone Reaches into the Northeast, the Soviet Army Will Cut Off Their Hand"... Far East Red Army Commander Declares</h3>
<p>The Chinese army also said that the Soviet army suffered heavy losses in the fierce war when they entered the Northeast. They will not easily give up these hard-won gains. The Chinese also said that the commander of the Soviet Far East Army said that if anyone other than the Soviet Union reaches into the Northeast, the Soviet army must cut off that hand!</p>
<p>While writing their dispatches behind closed doors, the journalists had to be constantly wary of the Soviet army bursting in. The journalists heard and saw enough evidence to support the following conclusions:</p>
<p>First: The so-called Kwantung Leased Territory—the Dalian and Lushun areas of the Liaodong Peninsula—has become a military industrial base for the Soviet army in the East. However, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Lushun is to be jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union, and Dalian is to be designated as a free port, open to all countries equally, but not to be used for military actions.</p>
<p>Second: The Soviet army will never withdraw from this area unless it receives valuable concessions from China in economic and military matters. They are increasingly insistent that they are not prepared to give up control of Dalian and Lushun at any price.</p>
<p>Third: The Soviet army interprets the Sino-Soviet Treaty as saying that the Soviet Union has full authority over Dalian during wartime. The Soviet Union does not recognize that the war is over until Japan signs a peace treaty. At the same time, this land is "leased" to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Koslov, the Soviet commander in Dalian, reprimanded the journalists for intruding into his jurisdiction without obtaining a Soviet permit, saying, "Dalian is not included in the Northeast."</p>
<p>Fourth: The ubiquitous Soviet secret police, who have been using terror tactics against the people of the Soviet Union since the October Revolution, have now followed the Soviet army into the Northeast, implementing espionage, conspiracies, and intimidation against anyone who disobeys the Party.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Using U.S. Liberty Ships to Haul Away Northeast Property... Japanese Soldiers Mysteriously Disappearing</h3>
<p>Fifth: The Soviet army has completed a systematic looting of the Northeast's heavy industry. They are using ships to transport these materials to Vladivostok and into the Soviet Union. According to reliable sources, some U.S. Lend-Lease Liberty ships are also being used to transport these looted items. Japanese soldiers were also forced to participate in the looting, after which they mysteriously disappeared. The detestable fleet of Kauftan, commander of the Soviet army in Shenyang, also participated in this activity, indicating that they have been sent to Siberia in the Soviet Union to serve the Soviets.</p>
<p>Sixth: The Soviet army is cooperating with the Chinese Communist army, arming them, and using them as propaganda tools. It is rumored here that the Soviet army is recruiting Japanese officers and technicians to create friction between the Japanese and the Chinese.</p>
<p>At present, only Stalin knows when the Soviet army will withdraw from the Northeast. However, even if the Soviet army withdraws, the great industrial area that the Japanese painstakingly built from the Mukden Incident to the Pacific War has long been "completely changed"!</p>
<h3>Machinery Moved to Siberia: Shenyang Only a Hollow Shell; Citizens Startled Birds</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 3rd [Day of the Month], Translated and Sent by Ping Qi</p>
<p>Shenyang was originally the most important industrial backbone of China, but now it has been plundered, leaving only a hollow shell. It has suffered the most scientific and thorough robbery and theft in history, becoming a lawless and terrifying world!</p>
<p>After staying here for five days, the reporter reached these conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet authorities have completely emptied Shenyang's vast industrial facilities, transporting hundreds of thousands of tons of machinery to Siberia.</p>
<p>(2) Acts of violence occur almost daily, and the people of Shenyang have become startled birds.</p>
<p>(3) The Soviet authorities have provided enormous indirect assistance to the Chinese Communists, and many reliable witnesses claim that, in addition to this indirect assistance, they are in fact directly cooperating.</p>
<p>(4) In Shenyang, as in Moscow, the central government has no real power.</p>
<p>Shenyang's Industrial Destruction More Severe Than Tokyo's</p>
<p>Shops on every street are closed, with only small stalls on the sidewalks doing business, selling nothing but scattered old goods looted from Japanese homes. The curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. leaves the streets of Shenyang deserted at night. Gunshots are heard every night, and theft, robbery, and assassination have become "commonplace."</p>
<p>The Japanese had established an industrial zone in the western suburbs of Shenyang, which accounted for 60% of the entire industry of the Northeast provinces. Now, it is a ruin. While the destruction of Tokyo and Osaka was certainly severe, the destruction of Shenyang was even more thorough.</p>
<p>The machines in the factories have been looted. First to be removed were window frames, telephones, and some light equipment. This was the first act of revenge by the Chinese masses after breaking free from Japanese constraints.</p>
<p>Anshan's Machinery Removal: Totalling Fifty to Sixty Thousand Tons</p>
<p>Next, the Soviet authorities brought trucks, and Japanese prisoners of war became porters, dismantling all kinds of equipment. For ease of transport, holes were knocked through the walls. Machines and equipment were dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union. Some empty houses were blown up, while those that remain have only walls and roofs left.</p>
<p>An engineer forced to participate in this work told me that the Soviet authorities had done the same elsewhere. He said that 70% to 80% of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works had been dismantled and transported to Yase Port, Dalian, and Korean seaports, before being loaded onto ships bound for Vladivostok. Some of the transport ships were American Liberty ships, but manned by Soviet crews. He said that 50,000 to 60,000 tons of machinery were moved from Anshan, and 150,000 tons more were exported through Dalian alone.</p>
<p>Removal of Generators: What Terrible Consequences Are to Be Imagined</p>
<p>The generators from the Yalu River Power Plant, which supplied electricity to the southern parts of the Northeast provinces, were also removed by the Soviets. After the generators were removed, Shenyang often experienced power outages, and the water supply was frequently interrupted.</p>
<p>The consequences of the water supply interruptions are very serious and unsanitary. If the weather warms up, there is a risk of a large-scale epidemic. Tens of thousands of people in the Northeast have already lost their lives to typhoid fever, causing great concern to the authorities.</p>
<p>On the streets of Shenyang, we, the first group of foreign reporters to arrive, were very welcome. The reporter group consisted of 22 people, including Americans, British, and French, some of whom were photographers. Chinese pedestrians on the street stopped and eagerly asked us, "When will the Americans send the national army here?" Even the Japanese were happy, asking, "When can they send us back to our country?"</p>
<p>Some Conversations Among Our People Resulted in Death by Gunshot</p>
<p>People here speak very cautiously, and repeatedly instruct us not to mention their names when writing the articles. Many people refuse to meet with reporters at all. One report says that a Chinese man who spoke a few words to reporters was later shot dead in front of his own gate.</p>
<p>This kind of unease affects not only the Chinese people and the Japanese, but also the White Russians. There are about 30 German Nazis in Shenyang. They did not seem to be affected much when the Soviet army moved in. One person told me that two weeks after the Soviet army entered the city, he had personally seen the Nazi flag still hanging on the roof of the German club.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Directly and Indirectly Assisted the Communist Army</p>
<p>Some have pointed out that the Soviet army has assisted the Eighth Route Army in attacking the national army three times, but such direct Soviet aid to the Chinese Communists is not easy to prove. General Kauftan Shtankevich, the commander of the Soviet army in Shenyang, has denied this claim. He said that only once did a Red Army truck loaded with sweet potatoes get damaged in the battlefield between the Nationalists and Communists.</p>
<p>Some people witnessed the Communist army using weapons seized from the Japanese army. A captured Communist officer also said that a Soviet army liaison team had supplied his unit with nine Japanese machine guns, as well as other equipment.</p>
<p>Whether these direct assistance from the Soviet army to the Communist army is true or not, we will put aside for the moment. However, it is very clear that the Communist army has received indirect assistance. Because the government army must obtain permission from the highest authorities before it can move, it cannot move freely in the Northeast, while the Communist army can move at will, which has given great help to the Eighth Route Army. At present, the central army occupies the railway from Jinzhou to Shenyang, and there are some troops in the suburbs of Shenyang. But apart from these places, all the rural areas are controlled by the Communist army.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Held Demonstrations; Bullets Pierced Our Headquarters</p>
<p>Opinions vary on the strength of the Communist Party in the Northeast. One figure I heard was 300,000 people, of which about 50,000 are said to be seasoned veterans of the Eighth Route Army, while the rest are recruited locally.</p>
<p>In Shenyang, there are six municipal officials appointed by the National Government, plus a headquarters commanded by General Peng Bisheng, but none of them have any real power. The city is completely ruled by the Soviet army.</p>
<p>The night before, the Soviet tank corps held a demonstration within 100 yards of the headquarters of the Central Twenty-fifth Division for four hours. Several bullets hit the walls of the headquarters. Soviet gunners broke into the room of the mayor of Shenyang, who was sent by the central government, wanting to seize his radio. Someone politely advised General Peng Bisheng and other officials to move to a hotel managed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Controlled Factories; Losses Impossible to Estimate</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities cannot estimate the exact losses caused by the Soviet looting here, because some factories are still guarded by the Soviet army, and Chinese people are not allowed to enter. Without the prior permission of the Soviet army, the Chinese are powerless. The Chinese officials themselves live in fear, a fear that was triggered by the assassination of Zhang Xinfu and six attendants in Fushun in January. The circumstances of this assassination made many believe that the Russians were closely related to the case.</p>
<p>Today, Shenyang is like a city occupied by an enemy army. In comparison, the residents of Tokyo are still happy.</p>
<h3>"Four-Legged Culture" in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Our Newspaper; Will Be Available for Mailing Today</p>
<p>Ito Hirobumi wrote a travel poem about Taiwan: "Treat everyone equally, without favor, use this heart to govern peacefully, the hall sings in harmony, moving heaven and earth, long live the Japanese Emperor."</p>
<p>Taiwan has been ceded to Japan since the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. For 51 years, Taiwanese people have been subjected to Japanese enslavement education and "Imperialization" policies. The culture itself has undergone great changes. The content of Taiwanese culture has become a complex thing, neither purely Chinese nor purely Japanese. Taiwanese people wear Japanese kimonos as outerwear, but the undershirt is still a Chinese-style undershirt. Although under the forced oppression of Japanese enslavement education and enslavement politics, Taiwanese people can still maintain their national consciousness forever and make tenacious passive resistance with the spirit of the nation, which is also admirable.</p>
<p>51 years ago, the incompetent Qing government, with the base and cowardly mentality of "Taiwan's resistance endangers the capital," forced the Taiwanese people to accept Japanese rule. How disappointed the Taiwanese people were with their motherland at that time. For 51 years, the Japanese have used all kinds of methods to enslave the Taiwanese people. Although a few Taiwanese gentry and rogues were willing to serve the Japanese, the Japanese were able to boast to the world that their governance of Taiwan was excellent.</p>
<p>The Japanese government printed the above-mentioned poem by Ito and photos of Taipei City on postcards to promote to the world. The first sentence certainly needs to be heavily discounted. The second sentence completely exposes Japan's ambition for Taiwan. The third and fourth sentences, in their nauseating way, show the achievements of Japan's "enslavement" and "Imperialization" of the Taiwanese people. But most of the Taiwanese people wholeheartedly despise the Japanese rulers and their customs, cultural relics, and systems, mocking them as "four-legged culture." This phrase is truly poignant and humorous.</p>
<p>Because Taiwanese culture and Chinese culture have been separated for 51 years, they still cannot catch up today after the restoration. This was expected. Because Japan has always regarded Taiwan as a colony, it does not allow the Taiwanese people to learn the academic subjects that the people of the colonies cannot learn. So Taiwanese people's foundation in social sciences is too poor. Now, Taiwanese people must strive to learn the national language and Chinese to get closer to the culture of the motherland. They must also start to learn social sciences to build a new Taiwanese culture.</p>
<p>Equality with Men</p>
<p>In the past, Taiwanese women, like Japanese women, had no status or power in society or in the family. The current Taiwanese women are the same as Chinese women. China believes in equality between men and women. But the majority of Taiwanese women are still working as maids, waitresses, clerks, and ticket sellers. This is also due to education. Because in the past, Taiwanese women were educated by the Japanese, and Japanese education was different for men and women in spirit and form. It absolutely did not allow women to freely develop their talents, let alone allow them to participate in political activities. Now, Taiwanese women can be equal to men. Female students are included in each session of the Taiwan Provincial Local Administrative Cadre Training Corps. They have realized and proved that their status has indeed been improved. In the future, Taiwanese women will definitely be able to keep pace with Taiwanese men. They will be able to do what women in other countries can do, and they will definitely be able to do it well.</p>
<p>Youth's Distress</p>
<p>In the past, most Taiwanese youth received vocational education. Even those who received university education studied medicine and agriculture. Therefore, the issue of occupation is almost the most serious problem for Taiwanese youth today. Unemployment is the greatest distress of Taiwanese youth. Several students from the middle school teacher training class of the Taiwan Provincial Local Administrative Cadre Training Corps spoke to me in Japanese about the pain of unemployment. Although the situation in Taiwan is very good, most of the factories that have stopped production have not yet resumed, and there are fewer opportunities for young people to find employment. In addition, prices are rising and it is difficult to make a living. Unemployed young people hope to get jobs immediately.</p>
<p>When Chief Executive Chen took office in Taiwan, he expressed his willingness to employ Taiwanese youth. In addition to the "standby personnel registration" that has already been held by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Chief Executive Office, the "Enterprise Management Personnel Training Class" held by the Provincial Training Corps has also been completed. All the trainees have been assigned positions by the Chief Executive Office. The Provincial Training Corps is now continuing to hold "Accounting Personnel Training Classes" and "Civil Affairs Personnel Training Classes," "Propaganda Worker Training Classes," etc. Therefore, the occupation problem of Taiwanese youth will not be a problem in the future.</p>
<p>The second distress of Taiwanese youth is that they do not understand the national language and Chinese. Chinese can be learned slowly, but the need for the national language is especially urgent. As a result, many national language tutoring schools have appeared everywhere. Some of them have excellent teaching methods, but many of them have inaccurate pronunciation. Taiwanese youth who are eager to learn the national language often find that there are several different pronunciations of a word, and they do not know which pronunciation is correct. The students of the Provincial Training Corps also reported to the Director of Education that the pronunciation of the national language teachers was different. In the country, whether it is a southern or northern accent, it can be understood. In Taiwan, which has been isolated overseas and occupied for 51 years, teachers who teach the national language should teach with standard pronunciation.</p>
<p>Currency and Exchange</p>
<p>Taiwan currently still uses the Taiwan dollar. It is found that the Taiwan dollar was issued by the Taiwan Bank, which was jointly established by Japanese officials and merchants. According to Chief Executive Chen's approval, the ratio between the Taiwan dollar and the legal currency is that one Taiwan dollar is equal to 30 legal currency. But in Taipei City, it only takes 20 or 24 legal currency to exchange for one Taiwan dollar. Because there is no national bank, Taiwan and the provinces of the mainland do not have remittances. More than 95% of the families of the people who come to work in Taiwan are still in the mainland, and remittances have become a major difficulty. Now all remittances are sent by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Chief Executive Office to Shanghai, and then Shanghai separately remits them to the provinces. Not to mention distant places, even Fuzhou, which can be reached the next day, takes two months to receive the funds remitted by the Chief Executive Office. Therefore, some people are willing to sacrifice the right to exchange one Taiwan dollar for 30 legal currency, and exchange the Taiwan dollar for legal currency (20 yuan) and entrust someone to take it to Fuzhou to remit to their homes. All public servants and teachers who come to Taiwan hope that the National Bank can come to Taiwan as soon as possible, so that remittances can be convenient in the future. When the reporter was sending the manuscript, I heard that Executive Yuan President Song had flown from Shanghai to Taipei. Perhaps his arrival can solve some of Taiwan's difficulties.

<p>New Method of Training Pilots: Miss Jane, an American, uses a "radar-like" (translated based on the "雷" sound) controller to start a prototype aircraft. This controller is no different from a regular one and is specifically used to train pilots. This invention will be publicly displayed at the World Invention Exhibition in Chicago in April 1946.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>How to Complete China's Post-War Reconstruction in the Shortest Time</h3>
<p>This article was written by Professor W.I. Kenter of Brown University in the United States. He is currently an engineering consultant to the Chinese Military Affairs Commission, has been in China for more than two years, and has made many contributions to military engineering. He recently returned to the United States. He wrote this article to express his opinions on China's post-war reconstruction, which are worthy of reference by the Chinese people. Translated by Mr. Tao Shuzeng, a member of the Engineering Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, for public viewing. —— (March 1st)</p>
<p>(1) Theme: The main purpose of this article is to provide a method by which China's great post-war reconstruction can be completed in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(2) Scope: This article only discusses state-owned construction. Private and provincial construction projects that are not of national scope are not discussed. Furthermore, this article only discusses the government's management methods, which can enable the completion of the largest amount of construction projects in the shortest amount of time, without discussing the raising of capital for state-owned construction.</p>
<p>(3) General Discussion: To ensure lasting world peace, it is extremely important for China to achieve a leading position among the countries of the Far East. To achieve this position, China must achieve accomplishments in the next 25 years that other countries have never achieved before. Where there is a will, there is a way, depending on China's determination. To accomplish this great task, the entire nation must be awakened to move forward courageously, each doing their best, with particular emphasis placed on trusting experts.</p>
<p>(4) Organization of Engineers: (A) China has a severe shortage of experts, who should not be left idle or used inefficiently. To enable each engineer to exert their maximum capacity and efficiency, we suggest that a Ministry of Construction be organized under the Executive Yuan. Its organization should include five general bureaus: [1] General Bureau of Railways, [2] General Bureau of Highways, [3] General Bureau of Aviation, [4] General Bureau of Ports, [5] General Bureau of State-Owned Water Conservancy Engineering. In addition to the five bureaus, a Design Committee should be established, with the Vice Minister serving concurrently as Chairman, and the directors of the five bureaus serving concurrently as members, leading the work of the five bureaus under the direction of the Minister.</p>
<p>(B) The tasks of the Ministry of Construction are as follows: [1] Formulate a five-year national construction plan. [2] Balance state-owned enterprises managed by this ministry and other ministries. [3] Design state-owned projects. [4] Prepare engineering budgets. [5] Guide or assist in guiding the construction of state-owned projects. [6] Serve as an assistant to the Chairman in engineering administration and as an engineering consultant to other ministries. [7] Conduct proposal surveys and reports for state-owned projects. [8] Review the purchase of engineering materials.</p>
<p>(C) Each general bureau has its own specialized responsibilities, but all must directly report to the Minister in order to coordinate and cooperate with each other into a harmonious whole.</p>
<p>(D) What must be specifically pointed out is that projects completed and accepted by the Ministry of Construction will be transferred to the ministry in charge of use or management. The responsibility of the Ministry of Construction lies in the planning, coordination, design, estimation, and construction of state-owned projects, but it does not use or maintain them after completion. This ministry is a purely service-oriented organization, and its expenses are drawn from the national treasury, not from the income from the use of the projects it creates, so that all engineers fall under the category of civil servants, providing the most efficient and economical service to the country and the people.</p>
<p>(5) Benefits of Organizing the Ministry of Construction: By organizing the Ministry of Construction, the country will quickly reap the following benefits:</p>
<p>(A) State-owned projects are concentrated in a single sponsoring agency. Centralized sponsorship is efficient and economical, redundant facilities can be avoided, and management and user agencies, not being concurrently engaged in new construction, can concentrate their efforts on use, management, and maintenance. Construction authority is in the hands of those with specialized knowledge and long-term experience, which is bound to be economical.</p>
<p>(B) Work between other ministries is easier to coordinate: China's future position depends on the government's understanding of current difficulties and its efforts. The solution to the current serious problems of lack of transportation, low production, weak purchasing power, and reduced imports and exports all depend on the engineers' most meticulous planning of the five-year plan. Not just one five-year plan is needed, but several five-year plans must be in place, and each plan must provide adequate solutions to national transportation, transportation, production, and raw material production problems. Only engineers can make the most appropriate plans and coordination for the above problems. If the various competent ministries can trust the adjusted plan of the same government agency and implement it accordingly, then the mutual coordination of work, administrative convenience, improved efficiency, and reduced waste are inevitable. The Ministry of Construction will be the most suitable organization for designing and adjusting the five-year national construction plan.</p>
<p>(C) Every engineer is used effectively: According to this organization, every engineer can be placed in the position that best suits them. If one bureau has less work, its engineers and auxiliary staff can be transferred to another bureau for use. This economical usage is only possible with an organization affiliated with the same superior agency. China has too few engineers, and there are many construction plans waiting to be launched, and in the next ten years or so, every engineer should do their best to work for the country every day.</p>
<p>(D) Business technicians and private companies can be utilized as much as possible: The scale of China's construction is extremely large, and even if all public and private engineers and construction companies in the country are used for design and construction, it will not be enough. If there is a central construction agency, such as the proposed Ministry of Construction, it should make full use of the power of business technicians and private companies, and cultivate construction companies and consulting firms operated by foreigners in China. It is also fundamentally necessary to train the use of new tools.</p>
<p>(E) The power of destructive factors can be reduced: China's current state of unrest is indeed affected by the turbulent state of the world as a whole; but there are many more special circumstances within China. Within these special circumstances, the Chinese government cannot take measures in certain areas, and the situation is even more serious due to traffic difficulties and low production. The lack of production leads to a reduction in people's purchasing power, and the reduction in people's purchasing power reduces the production of goods. The two are mutually causal, and over time form a vicious circle. The current plan is to provide these areas with the necessary means of transportation, complete transportation networks such as railways, highways, aviation, and waterways, develop their rich natural resources, and industrialize their people. This kind of unrest can be reduced. The way to achieve the above goals is to have engineers and others dig ditches, build embankments, build water power, drain accumulated water, and make millions of acres of drought-prone and waterlogged land cultivable and ensure a quantitative harvest. Various construction projects are immediately started so that the people have something to do, and they can personally see the government implementing the plans for rehabilitation and national construction. The turbulent situation will gradually decrease and even disappear with the success of various undertakings. Only a properly organized group of engineers can provide China with a properly coordinated railway, highway, and aviation system. Only the power of engineers can save the raging rivers and turn them into beneficial construction forces for China. Only the power of engineers can improve the living standards of the general people, increase domestic unity, and sweep away local disappointment and the factors of unrest. The organization of engineers will reflect the strength and power of the new China.</p>
<p>(6) Recommendations: The following recommendations are hereby made:</p>
<p>(A) Establish a Ministry of Construction under the Executive Yuan to be responsible for the planning, design, and construction of state-owned projects.</p>
<p>(B) The Minister of Construction must be an engineer with specialized knowledge, skills, vigor, and leadership qualities, administrative experience, and management skills.</p>
<p>(C) All engineers of the Ministry of Construction shall be civil servants, so that their positions are guaranteed, their merits are rewarded, their salaries are commensurate with their responsibilities, and they feel that they are serving the country and are respected accordingly.</p>
<p>(D) Private companies, business technicians, and foreign companies or firms operating in China who participate in national construction work shall be cultivated by the Ministry of Construction.</p>
<p>(E) The Ministry of Construction shall establish an expert advisory group of foreign nationals to assist the Minister in writing a five-year national construction plan, assist in the planning, design, and construction of large-scale state-owned projects, assist in research work, such as soil strength, foundation design, water conservancy model tests, etc., and assist in the purchase of engineering equipment, so that China's engineering technology and the equipment used are as advanced as those of advanced industrial countries.</p>
<p>(F) The Ministry of Construction should cooperate with engineering colleges, adding systematic research on engineering problems to the curriculum, so as to improve the knowledge of engineering graduates, and as information for more economical and more advanced design and construction in the future. Chinese soils must be classified from an engineering point of view, the drainage area of major rivers must be surveyed, hydrology must be widely studied, methods for soil and water conservation and reclamation of large areas of wasteland must be mastered, and the knowledge of flood prevention must be far more advanced than in the past.</p>
<h3>Amateur Radio Appeal: Guarantee Academic Freedom</h3>
<p>— Shen Yizhi</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported in the newspapers that the Telecommunications Supervision Section of the Ministry of Communications was established in Shanghai to handle the application and registration procedures for wireless radio manufacturers, radios, and component purchases and usage; the purpose is to prevent wireless electrical appliances from falling into the hands of criminals for illegal use, and it has also held a discussion meeting with some manufacturers. Although no measures have been announced yet, judging from the points published in various newspapers, I cannot help but worry about the future of our amateur radio research community. And my amateur colleagues have not yet put forward any opinions, or pointed out the advantages and disadvantages, for the reference or adoption of the authorities. I am one of the amateur comrades, and I would like to state my views on the point that the authorities intend to implement the purchase of wireless electrical appliances.</p>
<p>Britain also implements registration and charging of radio users, and the penalties for evading registration and payment are quite severe, but on the contrary, special exceptions are made for amateur researchers. An amateur can freely go to any electrical appliance company to select or customize the components they need; the government also has various incentives and assistance measures. The driving of airplanes and the operation of submarines are not the result of the countless efforts of researchers in the laboratory day and night. Rockets and radars also do not grow out of the soil. However, our country only talks about "form" and does not ask about "reality". On October 9 last year, Chairman Chiang broadcast on the Central Radio Station in the accompanying capital: "The policy of cultural construction is to encourage scientific research, guarantee academic freedom, and improve social customs..." Science—radio is also one of science—is of course important in the current century, and everyone knows it. Only by "encouraging scientific research and guaranteeing academic freedom" can new discoveries, new reforms, and new successes be contributed to the government from the hands of researchers! Now we do not hope that the government will give us "encouragement", but is "guaranteeing academic freedom" our minimum requirement! The previous newspaper reported that the section announced: "Applications should be made to the Supervisory Section for the purchase of wireless electrical appliances, and after the section issues a 'Purchase Certificate', purchases can be made from designated merchants based on the 'Certificate'..." We know that an amateur purchases components mostly in a hurry and are not pre-planned. Now that an "application" has been made, even if they are lucky enough to be "qualified after review" and receive a "Purchase Certificate", the time spent will definitely not be within three to five days. By then, the researcher will have long since lost interest and will not be able to muster any interest; not to mention that there are various reasons such as being unable to "qualify" after "review", and those who come to apply for purchase from outside the city cannot wait long. This is simply hindering "scientific research" and restricting "academic freedom"; and how can social customs be improved, and how can cultural construction be completed?</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications should establish a "Wireless Radio Amateur Research Association". All amateurs must join the association, but considerable guarantees are required to prevent spies from mixing in. Membership fees should be charged annually to cover the various expenses of this project. The association will issue certificates and purchase certificates (with photos attached), regardless of region, quantity, or type, without the need to apply. All members have the right to "free purchase"; however, retailers should copy the purchase certificate number, etc., and submit a list for the authorities to check at any time.</p>
<p>I hope that amateurs will respond and urge the authorities to implement it, giving us a guarantee of academic freedom!</p>

<h3>National Post Office in Deficit: Losses Exceed Ten Million per Month</h3>
<p>Whether Japanese Postage Rates Will Be Adjusted Has Not Been Ordered</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Wang Yuguang, the assistant of the Shanghai Postal Administration, told reporters yesterday that when victory came, the Shanghai Post Office made a considerable profit due to the adjustment of postage rates. However, due to soaring prices in recent days, the income from postage has been insufficient to cover expenses. Recently, the total amount of losses of post offices nationwide has reached more than ten million yuan per month, becoming a major burden on the country. The reporter then asked whether the post office was considering adjusting postage rates. Mr. Wang replied that he had not yet received any orders from the General Post Office on this point. As for the postal situation in the nine northeastern provinces, the Harbin and Changchun post offices have been taken over, and an office of the General Post Office has been established in Changchun. The postal services in Subei and North China have not yet fully returned to normal and need to be negotiated. Mr. Wang also revealed that this issue may need to be resolved in Beiping. The postal service in Taiwan is smooth, but the organization there has always been a combination of postal and telecommunications services, which is slightly different from that of other parts of our country. The director and deputy director after the takeover were directly appointed by the Ministry of Communications and have not yet taken office. As for whether the post office will resume foreign exchange remittance services, it remains to be decided by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau.</p>
<h3>Properties of Deceased Traitors: Request for Instructions on How to Handle; Extremely Large Amounts of Properties of Traitor Chuan Xiao'an and Others Seized</h3>
<p>During the period of the enemy's invasion of China, those traitors who acted as accomplices, who had not been sanctioned by national law before victory and had luckily died, whether their remaining traitorous properties should be treated the same as the traitorous properties of traitors who had not died and had been arrested, and be confiscated in full, or whether they should still be inherited by the heirs of the traitor, and not be disposed of, the government authorities have not yet had clear regulations. Recently, the investigation team of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has seized many cases of traitorous properties of the above-mentioned situation, and because they could not be disposed of, they have submitted them to the Executive Yuan for explanation. According to personnel of the team, the traitorous properties of deceased traitors should be treated the same as the traitorous properties of traitors who have not died, otherwise the deceased traitors would be too cheap, escaping national law and maintaining their properties. For example, recently, the team seized the traitorous property of Chuan Xiao'an, the first puppet mayor of Shanghai, whose value was astonishing. Part of it was still in the name of the traitor Chuan, and part of it had been changed to the name of the heir. According to the investigation, the traitorous properties of Chuan include a large number of stocks in the Zhonghui Bank, Zhongya Bank, Minfu Bank, Ningshao Shipping Company, and Ningshao Insurance Company, Xiang Dayuan Hardware Store, and a large amount of hardware materials in two warehouses at No. 140 Wuchang Road and No. 6, Lane 89 Wuchang Road. Real estate includes all the houses in YuAnli, Wuchang Road, all the houses in Yuanheli, Gorden Road and Robeson Road, a foreign house at No. 1286 Yangshupu Road, and real estate houses in Xiafei Road and other places. The above-mentioned houses and warehouses have now been sealed and kept by the investigation team. Once the explanation and reply from the Executive Yuan arrive, they can be definitively disposed of.</p>
<p>Multiple Other Seizures of Traitorous Properties</p>
<p>In recent days, the office has also seized more than 200 houses and properties in the city that were owned by two major economic traitors, Chen BoFan, the chairman of the Puppet Match Control Joint Association, Wu Yong'An, the general manager of the Puppet Sino-Japanese Industrial Bank, and Gao GuanWu, the puppet governor of Anhui Province. The three traitors, Chen, Wu, and Gao, were arrested by our military authorities long ago, and their traitorous properties were only seized a few days ago based on confidential reports. Traitor Chen owns a total of 70 foreign houses in the Huanlong Road area, in addition to a large amount of land. Traitor Wu owns all the houses in Xiangmaoli, Diswei Road, and No. 162 to No. 167 Jiaeryi Ai Road, and all the houses in Lane 178, Tongren Road, a total of 91 houses. Gao GuanWu owns 17 houses in No. 669, Zhaojiabang Road, Nanshi (Tairuili). The above-mentioned traitorous properties have been sealed by the investigation team and are said to be confiscated in full.</p>
<p>Two Japanese Merchant Ships Seized</p>
<p>In addition, according to confidential reports, a certain Japanese trading company transferred two ships, Xieshun and Xiemao, to Chinese merchants Jiangsu Shipping Company and Huamin Transportation Company for operation after the victory. After the investigation team conducted a detailed investigation of the transfer process with the two companies, it found that the evidence held by the two companies was insufficient and suspected of forgery. Therefore, Xieshun and Xiemao were detained and confiscated last weekend and will be transferred to the China Merchants Bureau for takeover.</p>
<h3>Housewife Robbed and Tied Up</h3>
<p>Robbery Occurs on Wansheng Road</p>
<p>At 7:30 last night, three robbers suddenly came to the home of Kong Yongqing, resident of No. 2 Xishanli, Wansheng Road, Nanshi. Each robber produced a pistol and used scarves to tie up the housewife, etc. They were robbed of eight gold rings, two pairs of gold earrings, one gold bracelet, and one gold watch before escaping.</p>
<h3>Retrial of the Ishihara Yu Case: Verdict May Be Announced This Week</h3>
<p>The US War Crimes Tribunal retried Ishihara Yu, the Japanese war criminal and former translator of the Jiangwan and Wusong concentration camps, yesterday, and summoned Sato, the former director of the Wusong concentration camp, to testify. The Japanese was patient and untiring, and explained to the court that he did not know much about the matter, and only later learned that Ishihara Yu had abused prisoners of war. He also said that after learning about this, he immediately dismissed Ishihara Yu. The case is scheduled for retrial this morning, and a verdict may be announced this week.</p>
<h3>House Collapses on Chengdu Road</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The cross-street building at No. 128 Chengdu Road collapsed suddenly at around 12:15 yesterday afternoon due to years of disrepair. A man named Wo Wei was injured on the spot, suffering head and chest injuries.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Telegraphic Transfer Rate Unchanged Yesterday; More Registration Applications</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) The US dollar telegraphic transfer rate announced by the Central Bank yesterday remained at 2,020 yuan. Various designated banks and foreign exchange brokers referred to this for buying and selling, and the market was stable throughout the day. A reporter visited a person in charge of the international department of a designated bank, who said: Currently, there are not many transactions, and the Central Bank is not temporarily conducting futures trading. However, if various designated banks have futures positions, they can still try to conduct some trading, with a maximum term of three months. At present, because the Central Bank only announces the US dollar telegraphic transfer rate, if customers come to settle foreign exchange for other countries, the various designated banks must find their own exchange rate levels, which is relatively complicated. It is also heard that in foreign exchange market transactions, the Central Bank does not pay commissions when selling foreign exchange, and the commission between importers and exporters and brokers is 2.5 jiao per thousand yuan. The commission between banks and brokers is 1.25 jiao per thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Also: Importers and exporters have gradually returned to normal. Yesterday, they contacted the 27 designated banks and approved foreign exchange brokers one after another, which was more enthusiastic than the previous day. Until about 5 o'clock, according to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, more than 40 applications for foreign exchange from Chinese and foreign merchants have been received.</p>
<h3>US War Correspondent Returns to Shanghai from Shenyang</h3>
<p>Soviet Side Once Issued Expulsion Order</p>
<p>According to US military news: Seven US war correspondents returned to Shanghai from Shenyang yesterday. They claimed that this trip was the result of an expulsion order issued by the Soviet army. During their stay in the Northeast, their freedom of movement was lost, which was equivalent to house arrest. The telegrams from the reporters in Shenyang all arrived late, but although the reporters could not be stationed in the Northeast for interviews for a long time, the general public paid more attention to the subtle and unpredictable situation in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Emergency Measures to Regulate People's Food: Public Sale of Large Quantities of Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>In order to quickly regulate people's food, the Special Commissioner's Office of Food Administration specially held a joint public sale of miscellaneous grains with the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau in the conference room of the office at 3 pm yesterday. There were 5,025 packages of corn, 7,653 packages of sorghum, 608 packages of sweet potatoes, and 81 packages of red beans, totaling 13,000 tons. There were no restrictions on the qualifications of bidders. As of yesterday, 69 units had submitted bids.</p>
<h3>Robbery on a Minhang-Bound Steamer: Fierce Resistance for Three to Four Hours; Details of Police Chief Wang Zhenchang's Heroic Death</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Steamboats traveling between Shanghai and Minhang depart from the Old Zhabei Bridge on the Suzhou Creek every morning and arrive in Minhang around 5 PM. The day before yesterday, another steamboat, carrying flour, sugar, and other goods and over thirty passengers, had just arrived near Wangjiadu in Pudong around 1:30 PM when four bandits, who had been hiding in the lower deck disguised as passengers, suddenly pulled out box cannons, pistols, and other weapons to threaten the passengers and arbitrarily rob them. Fortunately, the boatman was alert and sent a signal to the shore in Pudong. The army and police on the shore noticed and fired several shots, which slightly deterred the bandits, who immediately stopped their robbery. Only a few people were robbed, and the losses were relatively limited.</p>
<p>People Assisting in the Capture of Thieves</p>
<p>When the boat reached Huajingkou in Puxi, the bandits jumped onto a small boat, ordered the boatman to quickly dock, and fled with their loot after landing. At that time, some of the passengers on the steamboat disembarked one after another and followed closely. Luo Mengyu, a patrol officer from the Changqiao Township Police Station of the Longhua Branch Bureau, had already received a report and led police officer Wang Zhenchang, a Shandong native, badge number 8601, and four other policemen to chase after them, firing shots from afar. The bandits, in desperation, fled across the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway to Bridge No. 4. By the time they were chased to Bridge No. 3, more and more people had gathered and assisted in the pursuit, creating a clamorous atmosphere.</p>
<p>Police Chief Shot Twice</p>
<p>Seeing the large number of pursuers, the bandits split into two groups, each taking cover behind a grave in the fields, and fired back. Police Chief Wang Zhenchang, fearlessly leading the charge, rushed to the side of one grave and captured two unarmed bandits, handing them over to the other policemen to guard. He then continued to another grave, only five steps away from the bandits, when he was shot in the chest and left leg. He collapsed and was then stabbed in the head over eleven times by one of the bandits, causing a profuse amount of blood to flow. He was barely alive. His police hat was also snatched away.</p>
<p>Fighting for Three to Four Hours</p>
<p>At the same time, police officers from the Meilong Township Police Station had arrived and were detaining suspects on the left flank of the Nan Zhujia Village. He, the Director of the Longhua Branch Bureau, personally led Criminal Section Chief Wang Chengying and over twenty police officers, driving a police vehicle to advance toward the central section of Zhujia Village. The entire police force of the Changqiao Branch surrounded Wengbanqiao on the right flank. The three groups of men jointly searched. The Shanghai County Police Bureau had also received a report and quickly dispatched two detectives, who met at Bridge No. 4. A fierce battle between the police and the bandits lasted for three to four hours, consuming over a hundred rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>Two More Suspects Apprehended</p>
<p>As it neared dusk, the two bandits armed with box cannons and pistols managed to escape. After a large-scale search of the surrounding villages, a suspect named Shao Ziquan from Nanjing was apprehended, carrying a load of pig bristles. He was taken to the branch bureau for interrogation. Police Chief Wang, who had been seriously wounded, was transported to Shanghai in a rice truck with the intention of sending him to the police hospital, but his injuries were too severe, and he died en route. Yesterday morning, Director He of the branch bureau told reporters that the death of Police Chief Wang in the line of duty was deeply regrettable and that his courage and ability were greatly admired. Police Chief Wang was thirty-six years old and had served in the police force for seven years, recently being promoted to police chief. Unfortunately, he tragically met his death, leaving behind a wife and child, with a desolate family situation. A request for generous compensation will be submitted to the General Bureau, it is said.</p>
<p>The two unarmed bandits who were captured are named Wang Jinfa and Li Jingen. According to their confession, the armed bandits at large were formerly soldiers, and they also revealed the addresses of their accomplices. Yesterday morning, Section Chief Wang of the branch bureau led section members to arrest a suspect named Yue Shouzhen at No. 7, Lane 596, Minguo Road. The two bandits who resisted arrest by firing guns are still being actively pursued.</p>

<p>Issuing Counterfeit Money and Manipulating Speculation</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mao Renyu, 47 years old, from Wujiang, who was the Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and the Chief of the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch, was recently accused of absorbing legal currency, issuing counterfeit money, manipulating speculation, and raising prices during the war and arrested. The High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution against him. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Court of the High Court in Tilanqiao opened the trial. The defendant confessed to holding the puppet position. He also stated that the total amount of counterfeit money issued was over 380 million yuan. The reason for printing counterfeit money without serial numbers was that prices were soaring at the time, and the turnover of money in the market was not smooth. In order to ensure a rapid supply, no serial numbers were added. The bank also hired a Japanese person named Kimura as a consultant. The authority to issue currency was actually in the hands of Zhou Fohai, who approved it and handed it over to the Business Bureau for handling. Although he had the title of issuing currency, he was actually only responsible for safekeeping. He hired two lawyers, Zhang Zhengxue and Li Baosen, to defend him. The court ordered him to be detained for a further hearing at a later date.</p>

<h3>Committee for the Defense of Democratic Spain Hopes for Sympathy from All Countries; Reception for Newspaper Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai-based Committee for the Defense of Democratic Spain hosted reporters from various newspapers yesterday at 3 PM on the third floor of No. 51 Guangdong Road. The chairman of the committee, Kao Luomo, the secretary, Pu Yana, the finance director, Jialamala, the surgical medicine specialist from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Elesi, and the traveling medical officer, Rong Geshou, (both of whom served with distinction caring for the wounded during the Spanish Civil War) attended.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Kao: The Franco government is the enemy of the Spanish democratic government. Since the Spanish Revolution in 1936, the people have been living in the tragedy of bloodshed. Franco has used his power to collude with the fascist Hitler, endangering the people. His violent power has caused countless Spanish people to suffer in misery. From now on, the Spanish people must respond to the call of the national Republicans to overthrow the "Franco government" in order to establish a new government of the people's freedom. At the same time, they deeply hope that all countries will sympathize with them and recognize the Republican government. Mr. Kao also said that although China has not yet recognized the Spanish Republican government, the Spanish Republican people are deeply grateful for China's friendship and sympathy for Spain and hope to cooperate more closely in the future. There are currently 450 Spanish residents in Shanghai, but some of them are children and Filipino or Chinese residents. The committee was established in November 1941 and secretly carried out its work during the enemy and puppet period.</p>
<h3>Continuous Spring Rains Cause Waterlogging; Actively Dredging Various Ditches; Intensifying Prevention and Planning to Form a Flood Control Committee</h3>
<p>The city has been experiencing continuous spring rains in recent days, coinciding with the high tide period, resulting in waterlogging in several areas in Xihui and the former French Concession. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in addition to directing its subordinate units to actively dredge the rivers and clear the ditches in various districts, has already obtained approval from the Municipal Government to establish a Flood Control Committee to specifically handle this matter.

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Over five hundred cleaners, wearing raincoats and carrying brooms, marched to the Municipal Health Bureau yesterday afternoon to petition and sent four representatives to meet with the director.

<p>Six Public Utilities</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The demands of the employees of the six major public utilities, which had been discussed by the Social Affairs Bureau for days, had been resolved. The workers were originally scheduled to sign the agreement yesterday afternoon. However, because the employers added a condition in the minutes, requiring the workers not to make any more economic demands within five months, the workers could not agree, so the signing became a pie in the sky. The Social Affairs Bureau plans to make further efforts today.</p>

<h3>Tight Credit and Few Buyers Cause Gold Prices to Gradually Decline; Jewelry Sales Also Lackluster</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, gold opened at 1.5 million, but gradually declined from 1.52 million, as there were no signs of easing credit. Holders rushed to sell in order to profit, and prices fell below 1.45 million. Jewelry stores absorbed some of the supply, and prices rose slightly to the 1.5 million mark. At noon, prices hovered around 1.47 million. Trading in the afternoon was sparse, and prices struggled between 1.46 million and 1.49 million. As a result, prices fell 30,000 compared to the previous day. Jewelry sales were gradually lackluster, causing buyers to be cautious. Decorative gold initially opened at 164,000, fell to 160,000, and finally settled at 162,000. Silver remained at 1,800, and silver dollars also stabilized, hovering around 850 yuan.

<p>Foreign currency US dollars were below 2,000 yuan. The Bank of China's telegraphic transfer was still at the original price of 202 yuan. In the morning, it was between 1,960 yuan and 2,000 yuan.

<h3>Rainproof Cloth Sells Briskly and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The continuous rainy weather has caused rainproof cloth to sell briskly. Spot prices have fallen. Stores have limited inventory, and are reluctant to sell at low prices. The supply and demand imbalance has caused prices to rise more sharply than any other product, from 2,600 to 2,700 yuan per yard to 4,000 yuan, and some are even quoting 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials for Silk Weaving Factories Decided to Continue Allocation; Both Spun Silk and Rayon are Available</h3>

Silk weaving factories will no longer have to worry about a shortage of raw materials.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea are Both Weak</h3>
<p>The silk market environment was poor yesterday, and continued to decline across the board, especially spun silk, which was even weaker. High-grade 5-dan spun silk was quoted at 2.1 million yuan, and ordinary spun silk from other regions was quoted within the 2 million yuan range. Sentiment was weak, and trading was light. 120-count Dahua rayon opened at 1.12 million yuan and closed at 1.77 million yuan. In the afternoon, the off-exchange price was 1.8 million yuan, but no one was willing to sell due to the impending allocation by the manufacturers. Semi-gloss spun silk was getting more expensive, quoted at over 2 million yuan, and finally traded at 1.95 million yuan. Silk fabrics fell along with raw materials.

<p>Recently, a large number of red and green teas have been shipped from Wenzhou and Taiwan, some in the thousands of boxes. Although there were actual sales, buyers were competing to sell, leading to an oversupply. The market was difficult to maintain its footing, and prices fell sharply. Wenzhou black tea fell to within 40,000 yuan, and Taiwan tea fell by about 10,000 yuan. The inventory of other teas was still not abundant, and holders were still reluctant to sell, so prices were still stable, but trading was reduced across the board.</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market Remains Calm, Spot Cotton Trading is Decent</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued its downward trend. This was due to a larger supply from the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) after the close of the previous day's trading, coupled with the significant quantities of 20-count yarn offered by major mills. This caused some traders with tight finances to sell off their stock for cash. Customer sales were slow, and prices fell by 50,000 to 100,000 (currency unit unspecified), leading to a calm atmosphere in the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was relatively stable, with decent trading volume. The Textile Construction Company's appetite for raw cotton remained strong, purchasing a total of 1,000 bales of Midling and Brazilian cotton. In addition, the privately-owned Baofeng Yarn Mill (寳豐紗廠) bought 200 bales of Tongzhou cotton. Traders were also actively trading Zhoupu seed cotton at a price of 15,500 (currency unit unspecified), it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company offered various colors and patterns of cotton cloth, totaling fifteen types. Most were purchased by local retail stores. Prices included: 41,000 (currency unit unspecified) per bolt for 30-yard "Four Gentlemen" printed white linen gauze, 80,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 40-yard "Water Moon" 190-pound shilin, 53,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 60-yard "Four Gentlemen" gray twill, 52,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 40-yard "Blue Peacock Dove" 7000 bleached cloth, 55,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 30-yard "Four Gentlemen" 60/2 bleached poplin, 56,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 42-yard "Jumping Carp" bleached cloth, 74,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 30-yard "Jumping Carp" natural-color feather damask, 48,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 30-yard 128-pound light green serge, 84,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 65-yard 32×6 gray canvas, 80,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 65-yard 32×6 white canvas, 40,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 30-yard "Four Gentlemen" printed linen gauze, 72,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 30-yard "Water Moon" natural feather satin, 47,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 30-yard "Juxian Village" printed straight tribute cloth, 40,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 30-yard 10-pound pink flannel lining, and 55,000 (currency unit unspecified) for 30-yard "Double Happiness" 60/2 bleached poplin. Today, in addition to the usual sale of woolens, cotton cloth will also be offered, it is said.</p>
<h3>General Overview of Textile Construction Company Operations</h3>
<p>Reasons for Higher Sales Prices</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Guild recently reported that the China Textile Construction Company (中國紡織建設公司) was restricting membership to the guild. However, the company's Business Department Directors, Zhang Siliu and Jiang Dixian, stated that this was not true. The company's current situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The company has registered the following number of yarn and cloth businesses:</p>
<p>329 yarn businesses, 812 cloth businesses (including weaving mills and towel factories), 198 knitting factories, 286 dyeing and weaving factories, 58 underwear factories, 80 handkerchief factories, and 174 woolen mills.</p>
<p>(2) The "fair-price" cloth sold by various companies in Shanghai is limited to 1.5 zhang (丈, approx. 3.3 meters) per person, resulting in lower prices. The quantity of yarn and cloth sold by the Textile Construction Company is not limited, and as it is a business operation, its prices are higher than those of other companies.</p>
<p>(3) The Textile Construction Company sells cotton yarn every Monday and Thursday, cotton cloth every Tuesday and Friday, and linen, wool, and woolen goods every Wednesday and Saturday.</p>
<p>(4) The company is internally divided into five departments: Business, Engineering, Accounting, Auditing, and Secretarial.</p>
<p>(5) The enemy and puppet factories taken over by the company are partly back in operation, while the remainder are being prepared for resumption of production.</p>
<p>(6) The raw materials for all yarn, cloth, dyeing, and weaving factories are supplied by the company, and the finished products of these factories are sold by the company.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Decline</h3>
<p>The rice market is sluggish, with North China japonica rice continuing to fall by 1,000 (currency unit unspecified). Early thin-husk rice and early indica rice followed suit, decreasing by 300-500 (currency unit unspecified). However, white round-grain rice and indica rice were stable due to limited supply. In the oil market, shipments from Qingdao were popular, leading to a sharp price drop of 2,000-3,000 (currency unit unspecified). Flour fell slightly by 200-300 (currency unit unspecified), and soybeans also decreased by varying amounts from 500-600 to 1,000 (currency unit unspecified). Bean cake edged lower by 200-300 (currency unit unspecified), wheat bran weakened by 100-200 (currency unit unspecified), and raw peanuts also showed signs of softening.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Grain Company</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Shanghai businessman Chen Zhongmu and others have recently launched a large-scale grain company named Hualian Grain Industry Co., Ltd. (華聯糧業股份有限公司), with a capital of 50 million (currency unit unspecified), initially collecting half. The business will focus on the processing and transportation of rice, wheat, and other grains.</p>
<h3>Strong Sales of Firewood and Charcoal</h3>
<p>Following the previous trend, bituminous coal blocks continue to sell well in the coal market, while bituminous coal dust and lower grades of white coal remain sluggish. The supply of firewood and charcoal is gradually increasing, and sales are also strong, making the market quite tight.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee Denies Return of Looted Yarn and Cloth, Citing Length of Time and Difficulty of Verification</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth, Dyeing and Weaving, and Yarn Industry Guilds requested the return of looted yarn and cloth. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau submitted the case to the Legal Advisory Committee for discussion. The committee concluded that the purchase of yarn and cloth was indeed forced by the enemy and puppets. According to the handling regulations and legal perspectives, the looted yarn and cloth should be returned. Five companies, including Yongxin (永新), Yongchang (永昌), and Licheng (立成), had already submitted documents and received approval from the Handling Bureau for return. Over 1,700 other companies were also in the process of collecting documents and applying according to the law. However, the 49th Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee ruled that because the Puppet Cotton Control Association's procurement of yarn and cloth had taken place a long time ago, and since the receipt of the yarn and cloth, most of it had been moved or double-sold, making verification impossible, the request could not be approved. The committee stated that if the yarn and cloth businesses held deposit slips from the Puppet Central Reserve Bank (僞中儲行) with unpaid amounts, they could directly apply for settlement at the Liquidation Office of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank. The Legal Advisory Committee's decision to approve the return of some yarn and cloth to Yongxin and other companies, without prior approval from the Review Committee, was revoked and declared invalid. Upon hearing this decision, the entire Shanghai cotton cloth, dyeing and weaving, and yarn industry was shocked, and many demanded that the guild fight for their rights according to the law. It is reported that the guild is currently discussing how to respond.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Cotton textiles remain weak due to the downturn in the yarn market. However, "901 Goose Brand" undershirts are selling well, and their price has uniquely risen by 2,000 (currency unit unspecified).</p>
<p>With the opening of foreign exchange, market sentiment has stabilized, and the prices of Western medicines have generally remained unchanged. Xiaozhilong tablets (消治龍片) have seen a slight price increase due to strong sales.</p>
<p>Among daily necessities, "Beautiful Phoenix" matches are selling well, and their price is showing a slight increase. The prices of various brands of soap are stable, while candles have seen a slight decrease.</p>
<p>The initial opening of the cigarette market has been quiet. There has been scattered selling of British American Tobacco (英美烟) products, while Chinese-made cigarettes are sluggish, and their prices have uniformly fallen.</p>
<p>In cosmetics, the season for vanishing cream has passed, and few traders are stocking it. The market price has also remained stagnant. Chinese and Western pharmacies have begun selling various perfumes, and trade is relatively brisk.</p>
<p>Paper sales have been significantly affected by the printing workers' strike. Very little Chinese-made paper has arrived, and prices have not easily decreased.</p>
<p>The prices of hardware items are mostly fluctuating in a weak range, with few increases. Only "Globe Brand" high-speed steel stands out due to the manufacturer's attention and scarce inventory.</p>
<p>In leather, transactions of yellow cowhide and black cow face leather are slightly more active, and prices have also risen slightly. The rest are generally stable.</p>

<h3>News from Hubei Province Middle Schools</h3>
<p>Wuhan Middle School Students Face Lack of Schooling; Provincial Government Promotes Secondary Education</p>
<p>(Xinhua News Agency, Hankou) Among the over 6,000 middle school students in Wuhan, after the placement of municipal middle schools, temporary middle schools, and various training classes,</p>
<p>Over 2,000 Students Have No Schools to Attend</p>
<p>There are still over 2,000 students who have no schools to attend. The Ministry of Education and provincial and municipal authorities are very concerned and plan to find ways to increase the number of schools. However, due to the wartime damage to many buildings in Wuhan, it is temporarily impossible to find school buildings. Although the buildings of the former Puppet Railway Institute are very spacious, they have been occupied by the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications. Recently, after the Ministry of Education requested and received approval from the Executive Yuan, a telegram was sent ordering the office to hand over the buildings to the Ministry of Education for use as school sites. It is reported that the original site of the Puppet Institute is large enough to accommodate more than 1,000 students. Once the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications allows the handover, the problem of Wuhan middle school students lacking schooling can be partially resolved.</p>
<p>Vocational Schools Planned for Western and Northern Hubei</p>
<p>(Our Hankou Report) According to an announcement by the Hubei Provincial Government, in addition to the existing 16 provincial senior and junior high schools, Hubei secondary education will add 2 senior high schools and 6 junior high schools. The original 11 normal schools will also add 2 schools. One women's normal school will be established in each administrative region, and one provincial normal school will be established universally. Wuchang will establish a kindergarten normal school, a physical education normal school, and a social education normal school. County-run junior high schools and simplified normal schools in various counties will also be restored. As for vocational schools, there were originally only 6 schools. Now, it is planned to add 16 schools in the Western and Northern Hubei areas.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Shanghai Universities</h3>
<p>Inconsistent Tuition Fees, Teachers' Salaries Need Adjustment</p>
<p>(Our Report) Universities in Shanghai have successively begun classes. This reporter has learned about the tuition fees from various schools as follows:</p>
<p>St. John's: Highest Tuition Fees</p>
<p>Among private universities, St. John's has the highest fees, totaling 45,000 (currency unit unspecified) (reduced from the original 70,000). The lowest is Shanghai University, at 28,000 (currency unit unspecified), because the school receives substantial donations from church organizations. Other schools such as Soochow, Aurora, Great China University, etc., mostly charge between 30,000 and 35,000 (currency unit unspecified), with limited differences. As for teacher hourly rates, Shanghai University has the highest, at 2,000 (currency unit unspecified) per hour, which is the same as the temporary university. The lowest is Jiaotong University, at 1,300 (currency unit unspecified) per hour. Other private universities are generally in the 1,500 (currency unit unspecified) range, which is not enough to cover teachers' transportation costs if the commute is long.</p>
<p>(Our Report) Professors at national universities in Shanghai have requested adjustments to their salaries and have sent telegrams to the Second Plenary Session, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education. It is reported that the Standing Committee is carefully studying and considering the matter.</p>

<p>More than 160 university professors in this area gathered at Fudan University to organize the "Shanghai University Professors' Association" (上海市大學敎授會). They elected Liu Dajie, Li Ximou, Zuo Renxia, Chen Kemei, Zhong Zhaolin, and others as 25 directors, and Jin Tongyin and others as 5 supervisors. They also scheduled a joint meeting of directors and supervisors for 5:00 PM today at the temporary university to discuss colleagues' situations, improve colleagues' welfare, and other fellowship matters. It is reported that private university professors will also ask the government for the same salary as the adjusted national university professors. If there is a shortfall, they will request the government to provide special funding to the schools.</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Aurora University, originally established in Shanghai, established a branch in Sichuan in the spring of 1938 during the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, the Shanghai headquarters has also been restored. According to the university regulations, the permanent establishment of branch schools is not permitted. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided to transfer this branch to local Sichuanese to take over and rename it Chenghua University. The takeover was officially implemented on February 1st. All of the Chengdu branch's assets, valued at 150 million (currency unit unspecified), have been donated and received by Chenghua University.</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple in Shanghai has established a "Buddhist Academy" to cultivate Buddhist monks capable of promoting Buddhism, and has specially set up a research department at the Xizhu Temple in Hongkou. Master Taixu has been appointed as the dean and will fly from Chongqing to Shanghai to preside over the opening ceremony soon, it is said.</p>
<p>Members of the Wesley Fellowship of the Chinese Christian Moore Memorial Church are holding a supplementary night school at 17 Hefei Road, Shanghai, recruiting male and female students aged 14 to 40. Students with levels ranging from junior primary to senior high school are welcome to enroll. Registration will begin on the 8th and classes will begin on the 15th.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Private China Girls' High School has resumed classes at its original site on Linyin Road in Nanshi. Its branch school at 286 Lane, East of Huangpi South Road on Fuxing Middle Road continues to recruit new students. The affiliated Guangming Primary School has also resumed classes there and offers half-fee positions.</p>
<p>The site for the Military Sports Academy is planned to be outside Zhongshan Gate in Nanjing, and military sports expert Cheng Dengke will be responsible for the preparations. It is expected to begin recruiting students this summer.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Basketball League: Outstanding Performance; Hualian Defeats Jiangwan; Zhang Liangxiong's Shooting is Divinely Assisted, Resulting in a 52 to 37 Victory</h3>
<p>The Hualian basketball team launched a very smooth offensive last night, defeating the Jiangwan Air Force team by a score of 52 to 37. This victory created a record of four wins and zero losses in the basketball league. In the first half, Hualian led by 6 points with a score of 27 to 21. The 1,500 spectators in the city stadium cheered. Li Zhenzhong was absent from Hualian, with only Chen Xuechong, Zhang Liangxiong, Kong Guangyi, and Bao Songyuan present. Wu Chengzhang did not arrive until after the scheduled start time to complete the team. Zhang Liangxiong's shooting last night seemed divinely assisted, and his incomparable skill earned him 20 points, making him the greatest contributor last night. Hualian led all the way in the first half, exceeding by two or three points. After tying at 15 and 17, Hualian broke away, ending the first half with a score of 27 to 21. At the beginning of the second half, leading scorer Zhang Liangxiong had already accumulated four fouls, causing concern for Hualian. Fortunately, the offensive did not decline. After a score of 29 to 25, Hualian scored thirteen consecutive points, leading by as much as 17 points with a score of 42 to 25. Although Jiangwan counterattacked and regained seven points, Hualian continued to score, resulting in a final victory of 52 to 37. Hualian's performance was extremely excellent. Although the Jiangwan Air Force's shooting was accurate, its disorganized formation was the main cause of its defeat. In the game before, Green Forest defeated Haiying by a score of 47 to 33.</p>

<h3>Wartime Zhejiang Cultural Cradle: A Glimpse of National Yingshi University (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Huang Lan</p>
<p>Currently, the entire school has over a thousand students. In the spring semester of this year, the College of Engineering and the two specialized departments of Administration and Finance have newly recruited 270 more students. Next year's quota is expected to increase even further. In terms of facilities, they are still rudimentary due to the relatively short history of the school and the extensive damage caused by the past battles in eastern Zhejiang. Although the Ministry of Education has approved an allocation of 90,000 yuan from the operating budget for equipment, it is feared that this will still be insufficient to meet actual needs. The faculty members have been extensively recruited over the years. With the exception of a few unsatisfactory individuals, most are scholars of profound learning. The school's curriculum is quite rigorous, especially in the College of Engineering, where the weekly teaching hours reach more than thirty hours, fostering a strong research atmosphere among the students.</p>
<p>In terms of academic atmosphere, it was previously characterized by composure and simplicity but has recently transformed into one of vitality and vigor. This is partly due to the stability of the situation and the uplifting of people's spirits and also due to the school's efforts to innovate its administration. Students have strong organizational abilities, and various alumni associations, student unions, and specialized academic societies are well-established. The student union regularly publishes "Yingshi Review," which makes significant contributions to school affairs. Various academic societies also publish specialized journals, providing students with ample writing opportunities. Other matters, such as the food committee, new student reception center, and various recreational competitions, are all managed by the students with remarkable success.</p>
<p>(5) Restoration Issues</p>
<p>Yingshi University is a child of hardship born from this war. Its inherent inadequacies and pitiable fate are undeniable. However, considering the determination of the entire school's faculty and students to revitalize the school and the highest significance of the government's establishment of Yingshi University, there is no doubt that Yingshi University will flourish in the future. Yingshi University's restoration plan this time includes three components: first, to determine a location in a major city as a permanent campus and build complete school buildings sufficient to meet the needs of the entire school; second, to add departments and open specialized disciplines according to actual needs in order to complete a comprehensive university structure; third, to recruit leading domestic professors and enrich the necessary equipment for each department so that teaching is truly worthy of the name. Apart from the first item, which remains unresolved, the other items have been carefully planned by the school authorities and submitted to the Ministry for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>As for the permanent campus issue: as early as two years ago, the Executive Yuan had decided that after the war, it would be moved to Shanghai or Wuxing to commemorate Mr. Yingshi's birth or martyrdom. Later, after the recovery of various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the school immediately sent personnel to investigate the campus locations in the aforementioned two places. Several former sites of the French-Chinese Natural Science Research Institute and other locations in Shanghai were tentatively designated as temporary school buildings, and more than a hundred Japanese military barracks were taken over in Wuxing County. Just as it was about to be submitted to the higher authorities for selection and relocation, the Ministry of Education suddenly intended to relocate it to Jinhua for the sake of distributing the national university education network. Later, President Du represented the students twice to visit Minister Zhu, requesting to maintain the old decision of the Executive Yuan to facilitate the future development of Yingshi University. At that time, no decision was made. Later, former Minister Chen and others advocated for a re-evaluation by the Executive Yuan before a decision was made, so the relocation was suspended. According to reliable sources, the new campus of Yingshi University will be located in Wuxing or may temporarily move to Shanghai for classes for a period of time. Therefore, the school calendar for this semester has been extended by three weeks, and the winter vacation has been shortened to one week. It is expected that it will end early in June this year. It is predicted that Yingshi University will have a new look after moving to Shanghai and Huzhou. (Sent from Yongjia on February 27th)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Dawn of Revival</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>Revolution is the duty of the people, not the privilege of a few. Officials are to serve the people, not special figures!</p>
<p>If these two points are clearly understood, there will be no end to the jokes. Look at the two major news items on the second day of this month's newspaper.</p>
<p>(1) The US Secretary of State's speech, "No country will be allowed to dominate the world alone!"</p>
<p>(2) The Second Plenary Session is expected to propose, "Eradicate bureaucracy and eliminate bureaucratic capital!"</p>
<p>It can be seen that the people of the country are awakening, and the world is also working towards a bright direction. This World War, after passing through this long period of darkness, divided the world into two major camps of "free world" and "controlled world." Now that Nazism has been destroyed, those who still want to control the world using Nazi methods can also deeply realize that such hegemonic ambitions will not be tolerated by the people of the world!</p>
<p>Progressive elements in the world should move forward along the right path of democratic thought. The so-called liberty, equality, and fraternity are linked together as one. Since the French Revolution announced the protection of human rights, anyone with hegemonic ambitions who wants to control the world has not escaped fundamental destruction. Did the ambitions of Germany's Wilhelm II and Hitler's mad tyranny mean that imperialism still exists now? Fanatical elements who blindly follow the crowd can also be vigilant!</p>
<p>The world is a whole, like cells in the body, inseparable from each other. No matter which corner of the world, if there is a part that is sick, it will affect the safety of the entire life. (See Ba Shan's Idle Talk), no one can survive independently from the crowd. Autocratic thought and bureaucracy, these two kinds of violence that violate humanity, please bury them in the Nazi graveyard. The dawn of revival is coloring [the sky] with the crowing of the rooster!</p>
<h3>Triumphal Song</h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>——Random Notes from a Small Town</p>
<p>Living in the occupied area for eight years without going "inside," I often feel very ashamed. But the more days I live in this place, the more I admire the fighters who fight in the wilderness and defend famous cities. When I was little, I read a poem in a stone-printed palm-sized novel: "The whip strikes the golden saddle ring, singing triumphantly together," I thought the rhythm was very pleasant, so I memorized it firmly. Even when I grew up and even now, I still haven't forgotten it.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is a sentence praising the triumphant expeditionary forces, and it may even have a bit of aggressive meaning in it, which may not be suitable for our resistance war this time. But in these eight years, every time I walked past the humiliation with tears in my eyes, I loved these ten characters even more. I am naturally not qualified to experience it in the realm of poetry, but it is good to think about it and see it often. Because I have not analyzed why I have this long-cherished hope, perhaps there is a bit of revenge in it?</p>
<p>But this kind of waiting is very difficult, because every day I have to walk past the humiliation, and every day I have to make a living in the face of humiliation. To be more practical, I can't bear the bitter taste of national subjugation, and I hope that the day of victory will come, because this poem represents victory, whether it is a victory with aggressive meaning or a victory for survival, in short, it releases the shackles of depression and allows us to straighten our backs in the face of humiliation.</p>
<p>I also know that it takes more perseverance to enter the realm of poetry, but there is a little extravagance. If I can't see the team striking the golden saddle and the soldiers singing triumphantly, then it's okay to just listen to the song called "Triumphal Song." Because I often went to a friend's house late at night to listen to his hidden and unmodified shortwave radio, which transmitted the song of resistance from the free small city, "Arise, you who refuse to be slaves," and the battlefield march "Swords slashed at the heads of the Japanese devils." These are still far away from victory, but I am already familiar with them, although they are not without stimulation. But because they grew up in humiliation, it seems that this humiliation will never end.</p>
<p>Later, this radio and my friend went to the "military police team" together, so I could only hear the local broadcaster shouting "I sing, I fly..." pretending to be happy songs, and decadent tunes like "Flowers are about to bloom red, and unmarried people are good." I am a person without a sense of music, so listening to songs is just a confused fascination with the "Triumphal Song."</p>
<p>In the past few years, I have been wandering for life, although not necessarily "exhausted," I have suffered even more the bitterness of being a slave. A little bit of spiritual comfort is not enough to heal the temporary wounds. Therefore, the more urgent I hope for victory, I even have Lu Fangweng's mood of "When the royal army recovers the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father during the family sacrifice." This heart of waiting for victory is more eager than a child in the twelfth month waiting for the New Year.</p>
<p>When I woke up, victory had quietly arrived. I didn't dare to believe it, and I wondered if I was dreaming, but it was indeed true. So I evoked the old phrase again: "The whip strikes the golden saddle ring, singing triumphantly together." This seems to be a wish that is too easy to realize. Every day I go to the street to wait for the national army. It is so hard to wait, so hard, so hard. One day, two days, three days, four days, I can't count them, but I finally waited.</p>
<p>I am just reporting the situation in our small place. The national army walked past with solemn steps; everyone shouted "Long live, long live!" loudly. There were two or three horses, but no songs. It doesn't mean that the love for the national army was reduced because there were no songs, but I just felt like something was missing, like a dream that had not been completed.</p>
<h3>Old House</h3>
<p>— Xiao Qun</p>
<p>I have come to this place again. I don't know if I have suddenly grown old or if other things have changed too quickly. I can hardly believe my eyes. Our old house is suddenly much shorter, the doors and walls have lost their luster, the white plaster has peeled off, leaving mottled stains, and everything has become gray and dilapidated. It seems like it has been deserted for many years, and its owner seems to have left this place for a long, long time, letting it collapse.</p>
<p>I see many unfamiliar faces. They don't seem to notice me. Firewood, charcoal dust, and dry branches are scattered all over the yard. Adults are sitting under the eaves basking in the sun or sewing something. Children are running around, falling down and wailing. Others are pinching chalk and drawing some clumsy patterns on the door panels. The gatehouse, which used to be tightly closed all year round, is now wide open. Occasionally, people shaking small drums and selling needles and threads pass by, stopping their steps; they look at it for a long time, their eyes containing some surprise. They might think:</p>
<p>"Hey, the owner of this house passed away not long ago, how could it become like this!"</p>
<p>Then they pick up their steps again, shaking their small drums and walking away with a tinkling sound.</p>
<p>Later, someone discovered me, walking over with trembling steps, looking at me from head to toe with dim eyes.</p>
<p>"Aren't you the second young master?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You're back!"</p>
<p>Many chickens are vying to eat in front of my feet, and the old man drives them away, but they gather again.</p>
<p>"Look, it's really outrageous, such a big yard has been ruined like this."</p>
<p>I look around with unfamiliar eyes, then I lower my head. I dare not think, I grew up here when I was a child. At that time, the glass windows were always wiped bright and clean, and the beams and pillars were painted red and shiny... A strong emotion tightly restrains me, my nose is sore, and I want to cry, but I finally barely hold it back. I turn my head and ask the old man:</p>
<p>"Have you been here all the time?"</p>
<p>"That's right, I'm old and can't move anymore. I've seen too much of what's going on in this house, young master, don't you remember how you used to pester me to grab...?"</p>
<p>I nod and give him a bitter smile. The old man continues:</p>
<p>"I really didn't expect things to change so quickly. To say that when this house was built, I saw it with my own eyes. Who would have thought that after so many years, it would be ruined like this. Do you see those residents in front? It's just outrageous, like a big tenement yard. If the old master knew there would be such a day, I don't know how sad he would be."</p>
<p>Our steps move slowly towards the back garden. As if discovering a miracle, I see a winter jasmine still climbing on the wall. This winter is not very cold, and after the New Year, yellow flower buds have already grown out. I feel a little joy. I pick a branch and smell it by my nose. A trace of a smile flashes across the old man's withered face.</p>
<p>"Only this winter jasmine is still alive, second young master, don't you want it? Where do you live? I'll send it to you right away."</p>
<p>But I shake my head, and I suddenly leave the ancient mansion again.</p>
<h3>Dialogue between a Horse and a "Horse"</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>——One of the Street Ballads</p>
<p>One day——</p>
<p>A horse-drawn carriage and a chartered car stopped in the same place;</p>
<p>The horse glanced at the coachman,</p>
<p>The coachman also glanced at the horse.</p>
<p>The horse spoke to the coachman:</p>
<p>(With a question mark drawn in its eyes)</p>
<p>"I am a horse, I can't help but let my shoulders and back</p>
<p>Be used as a road for people to walk on!</p>
<p>But what about you?——</p>
<p>But you are an out-and-out human being!"</p>
<p>The coachman lowered his head:</p>
<p>(With a faint bitter smile on his face)</p>
<p>"Please don't flatter me,</p>
<p>How can I be a human being?</p>
<p>You know, I'm just like you,</p>
<p>Also a horse!</p>
<p>The only difference is——</p>
<p>You have four legs,</p>
<p>But what about me?——</p>
<p>But I only have a pair!"</p>
<h3>Double Flight (18)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Li Yun's appearance was originally very pretty, but unfortunately, she had smallpox one year, and some scattered pockmarks were left on her face. This child is more innocent, lively, and stubborn than Lihua. In her narrow mind, she only knows how to play vaguely, and she is not interested in things other than playing. Because she was not born as beautiful as Second Madam Weng, and her temper was better than Second Madam Weng's, as long as there was something that didn't go her way, she would cry and make a fuss endlessly. Therefore, Second Madam Weng didn't like her very much and could only let her be herself. Naturally, Old Master Weng also had no time to educate her. Old Master Weng regarded Lihua and other things the same way, very lightly. But Madam Mo loved her more than her parents, perhaps because Madam Mo could not get comfort from her own children, she wanted to exchange feelings from other people's children. Moreover, in Madam Mo's consciousness, Second Madam Weng's daughter was just like her own daughter.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Old Master Weng's opium addiction has become more and more serious. He sleeps during the day and smokes opium at night, which makes Second Madam Weng still live a lonely life like seven years ago, and the days have become unbearable! Some of the fields that Second Madam Weng bought have been sold by Old Master Weng. Now there is only one house left, and Old Master Weng is still calculating that the price of this house can be enough for him to smoke opium for a year.</p>
<p>Second Madam Weng hated it so much that she gritted her teeth and often scolded Old Master Weng: "Why don't you die? If you die, I will be more peaceful." But Old Master Weng told her with a smile: "If I die, you will be a widow!" But Second Madam Weng didn't think so! Isn't Second Madam Weng equal to a widow now? Moreover, Second Madam Weng sometimes thinks: it's better to be a widow and be more free. Now that Old Master Weng is alive, she can't just marry someone like this, even though she has already had this idea.</p>
<p>In fact, the bankruptcy of the Weng family is not entirely the fault of Old Master Weng alone, Second Madam Weng is also responsible. Although she doesn't smoke opium, her consumption is also quite considerable. For example, she dresses up; she likes to play; she pays attention to eating and drinking; all of this expenditure is no less than that of Old Master Weng. Naturally, her reason is depression, so she needs to find recreation and seek sustenance in all aspects of life.</p>
<h3>Social Service American Youth Willing to Travel to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Seeking Hosts</p>
<p>Yesterday, an American youth sent a letter, translated as follows: "Dear Sir/Madam: I am an American, 31 years old, I am very fond of literature, and I have worked as a journalist. Although I did not serve in the military after the war, I also served in a production factory. After that, I plan to fulfill my long-cherished wish and engage in writing. I admire your country's cultural relics and am eager to travel to broaden my knowledge. However, my funds are limited and it is difficult to make a grand gesture. If I stay in your city for a few days, I wonder if there are any people willing to be hosts? If they can guide me, I will be grateful. After returning to my country, I will write a book based on what I have heard and seen, and then present it for your instruction, which will also be an aid to Sino-American friendship. Wishing you good health. J. Manka, December 10, 1945.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Old Zha Sub-Bureau Regarding the Discovery of Lost Funds from a Rice Store</h3>
<p>This column previously received a letter from Yuanfengsheng Rice Store, No. 533 Julu Road, stating that the Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road area is still a place where pickpockets appear. On the 22nd of last month, a shop assistant carried a large amount of legal tender and placed it behind a bicycle. When passing by the area, it was all cut away. He immediately reported to the Huangpu Old Zha Sub-Bureau for investigation. The shop assistant, feeling innocent and unable to clear his name, sought death. Therefore, he requested the two newspapers to publish it so that the police could pay attention to it and save his life.</p>
<p>This column forwarded the original letter to Sun Jialiang, the director of the Old Zha Sub-Bureau, for handling. Yesterday, Director Sun replied in a letter saying:</p>
<p>"Regarding the pickpocketing incident on Beijing Road, since I took office, two cases have been solved. The large amount of money stolen from the rice store has already been solved, and the store has been notified to come to the bureau to retrieve the lost funds..." This is specially published so that the owner pays attention.</p>
<h3>Service Briefing</h3>
<p>Seeking Lin Yimin I have been entrusted by the Political Department of the 70th Army of the stationed army in Taiwan Province to bring a document to Lin Changming's house at No. 1 Penglai Road, This city, for Lin Yimin. However, I went to inquire there yesterday, and there was no No. 1, so I could not complete the task. It is understood that Mr. Lin came to Shanghai on the order of the department to recruit political team drama propaganda personnel. The document I brought is for the purpose of these personnel going to Taiwan and is very important. I hope that your department will publish an interview on behalf of the department. Yang Cunshou of the Political Department of the 70th Army of the Army sincerely wrote.</p>
