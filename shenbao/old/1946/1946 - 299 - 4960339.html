<h3>主席訓詞全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北二十五日電〕主席廿五日在省光復週年紀念歡迎主席及夫人蒞台大會上，訓詞全文如下：</p>
<p>各位同胞：</p>
<p>今天欣逢台灣光復一週年紀念，中正特來參加這次慶祝大會，與我相別五十年的台省同胞同聚一堂，共同慶祝光復，使我五十年的宿志得如願以償，實在是我平生惑到最愉快最光榮的一天。</p>
<p>我們台灣省自甲午年四月十七日由昏庸的淸廷割讓給日本帝國主義以後，淪於敵手竟達五十一年之久，在這慘痛的五十一年之中，台灣全省同胞，固然身受日人的壓迫，備嘗政治上經濟上各種虐待不平等的痛苦，我們全國同胞，更是時刻關懷這座橫遭刦奪的實島，以及島上强被割離的同胞們，我們國父倡導國民革命，即以光復台灣爲革命的主要目標之一，國父在台灣失陷的一年，就在檀香山紐織興中會，當時發布宣言，就提出「恢復台灣鞏固中華」的口號，此後我們全國革命黨員，以及中正本人，無時無刻不本着國父的遺敎努力奮鬥，決心湔雪國恥，全力光復台灣，民國二十六年，我們舉國一致發動神聖壯烈的對日抗戰，於是光復台灣，更成我們革命同志積極爭取的目標，所以我在民國二十七年四月一日，在國民黨臨時全國代表大會中，曾經明白的宣布：「台灣是我們中國的領土，在地勢上，乃是我們中國克危存亡所關的生命綫，中國要講究眞正的國防，要維護東亞永久的和平，絕對不讓我們的台灣永久統治在日本帝國主義的手中，爲要達成我們國民革命，過止野心國家擾亂東亞之企圖，必須針對着日本帝國主義積極的陰謀，以解放台灣人民爲我們的職志」，這是總理生前所常對我個人以及一般同志所訓示的，總理的意思，就是我們必須使台灣的同胞，在政治經濟上能够恢復平等自由，使台灣同胞個個人能够恢復國家主人翁的地位，纔能鞏固中華民國的國防，奠定東東亞和平的基礎。</p>
<h3>宋院長飛抵滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕行政院長宋子文，廿五日下午一時半，由合飛抵滬。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北廿五日電〕宋院長廿五日晨十時半，專機離台。</p>
<h3>出席開羅會議　確定收回台灣</h3>
<p>我們以全國人民的決心和毅力，忍受着無數生命財產的損失和犧牲，對暴日進行堅靱英勇的抗戰，到了民國三十二年我親赴開羅與英美領袖舉行三國會議，決定日本「歷由中國所奪取之土地如台灣，澎湖羣島，及東北四省等歸還中國」至是我們失了五十年的台灣，已經確定了爲我中華民國的一部份了。去年八月十五日，日本軍事總崩潰宣吿無條件的向我們聯合國投降，我國即按預定計劃，進行接收失土的工作，幷得我們朋友美國熱心的協助，使一切復員工作都能順利的完成。去年的今日，我們中央政府特任今日的陳長官，爲你們台灣省行政長官兼整備總司令來台受降主政，同胞們去年今日，就是台灣省正式歸隷我國版圖的一日</p>
<h3>記取革命先烈　擴展愛國精神</h3>
<p>同胞們，今天這一天，實在是我們全國同胞最珍貴的一天，尤其是台省同胞最光榮的一天，大家要知道，光復台灣是一件極艱難而且得之不易的重大收穫，自從我們國父創導革命以來，爲了台灣的同胞和土地，我們就與日本帝國主義，無時無刻有形無形之中在長期不斷的作着激烈而慘痛的鬥爭，這次抗戰，全國同胞又復經受多少直接間接的犧牲，不知道流了志士多少熱血，斷送同胞多少頭顧，才使這淪陷五十一年的台灣，重返了祖國的懷抱，然而在此五十一年之中，我們台灣同胞雖遭受敵人這樣殘暴的壓迫，但是中華民族革命的傳統精神，並未有絲毫的喪失，自從明末淸初，民族英雄擲成功的反抗滿淸恢復台灣以後，連續的就有唐景崧·劉永福·邱逢甲等領導台民抵抗暴日，都是驚天地而動鬼神的光榮悲壯的中實，即在日人佔領時，本省同胞的抗日運動，亦復相繼不息，如林大北事件，簡大師事件，都是愛國的革命精神的表現，深望全省同胞，記取全國及台灣革命先烈慷慨犧牲恢復不易的史實，我們今後更應刻苦忍痛，團結合作，擴展先烈愛國革命的精神與毅力，同心一德的來建設新台灣，建設三民主義的新中國。</p>

<h3>重新建設台灣　成爲全國模範</h3>
<p>同胞們，合灣省光復到今天，已整整一年了，這一年來我雖因全國政務繁忙，不能來到台灣慰問同胞，但是我對於合省同胞的懷念。眞是無時或釋，我依據各方的報吿，深知淪陷期間，本省同胞所受長期的痛苦，更知作戰時期，本省同胞亦遭受不少損失與破壞，而光復以後，又因戰時破壞的緣故，在復興建設的工作上，又遇着不少的困難與阻碍，這種苦痛困難，雖然都是日本帝國主義剝削我們所遺存下來的餘痛，但是現在台灣已歸還我們祁國懷抱了，我們同胞個個人都已成爲國家的主人翁了，我們更應該要竭盡我們主人翁的責任與義務，迅速地淸除日本軍閥的殘毒，把台灣嶄新的重建起來。</p>
<p>關於復興建設的工作，一方面固然要地方政府積極推動，另一方面也要我全省同胞通力合作，向一個目標一個方向協調前進，才能圓滿達到任務。本省的物資條件相當優厚，國民敎育亦甚普及，民意機構又已全部成立，人民與政府共同努力，在陳長官領導之下，我相信台灣省的前途，一定燦爛光明，一定是可做全國的模範省。</p>
<h3>愛護全省同胞　遠勝其他各省</h3>
<p>至於我們中央政府之視台灣，一如離別家庭五十年的弟兄，一旦歸家，骨肉團圓相聚的情緒，這一番憐惜痛愛的心情，惟有身歷其境的人，纔能澈底的領會，惟有希望他能更得幸福，更能進步，不要因爲仇敵的打擊，面沮喪，消極，失意，灰心。所以對於本省的復興，本省同胞固然切盼迅速完成，中央政府的熱望，尤爲殷切，凡是合理而有利於台灣復興建設的事情，中央政府不斷的在督促指示長官公署積極推進。我今天可以向全省同胞宣布，中央的愛護台灣，遠勝於全國其他任何一省，中央對於台灣建設重視，也勝於其他的省份，希望我全省同胞，能共同努力，加倍奮勉，來建設三民主義的新台灣，盡到你們國家主人翁的責任，因爲建設新台灣，就是建設新中國的一部份，而建設新中國，乃是我們國民革命的終極目的</p>
<p>今天是台灣的光復週年紀念日，我得能親自見到遭受敵人壓迫已達五十一年的同胞，在靑天白日滿地紅旗幟之下狂歡慶祝，心頭眞有說不盡的喜悅，現在我祈求上蒼的庇佑，默禱國父及革命先烈在天之靈，使我們台灣同胞更强健，更進步，更自由，更幸福，來完成你們光復國土的使命！</p>

<p>台灣省全省運動會各運動員，靑年們，子弟們：</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>評最近關於基督敎會的事件</h3>
<p>在今日這種激盪不安的國際局勢下，近來連續發生與基督教會有關的新聞。南斯拉夫總主敎的處刑，曾引起梵蒂岡方面的不滿；據法國新聞社所傳消息，羅馬敎皇且擬發表文吿，加以譴査。此項敎廷的正式譴責文吿尙未發表，而據各電訊社從羅馬傳來的消息，却謂有南斯拉夫少女竟擬向敎宗庇護十二世行刺。敎廷方面對於企圖向敎宗行刺的報道，保持緘默，毫無表示；所以上開報道的是否可信，不無疑問，無論是否究竟有這種行刺敎宗的企圖，旣有如上的報道，當非空穴來風，或係事出有因。同時，上海任羅斯正統敎會的維克多總主敎近亦被我當局予以逮補，據報傳消息，謂有戰犯嫌疑，經已移送法庭，並傳現已保釋。維克多總主敎的被捕，上海俄僑頗表震驚。現在此案旣已移送司法機關審判，將來眞相必能大白。所以對於此案，我們不欲有所論列。凡上所陳，我們不過舉出幾個例子，以表示關於基督敎會的新聞，近來也迭有發生而已。</p>
<p>記得當從前羅斯福總統還活着，而三巨頭還不時有聚會的時候，羅斯福和邱吉爾曾與史達林談起羅馬敎宗在國際生活中所處地位的重要，史達林却反問他們，敎完擁有多少師團。這固然可以表示出唯物主義的唯物義觀：但認眞對不擁有一兵一卒的羅馬敎宗能有正確的認識的，怕還是希臘亦即俄羅斯正統敎會　道院出身的史達林。據說：史達林所認爲最終的敵人不是倫敦華盛頓，而是梵蒂岡，大約也爲此，所以在我們的所謂「解放區」內，被「解放」及「淸算」得最慘的，就有羅馬天主敎曾的份兒。蒂托的南斯拉夫，誰也知道已淪爲莫斯科的附庸，則在南斯拉夫的天主敎會，像在斯拉伐克的天主敎會一樣，自然也在「解放」「淸算」之列。也因爲此，我們看見有天主敎會在南斯拉夫總主敎的處刑，以及爲了尊重擁護大西洋憲章所規定，而同時又爲蘇聯所接受的四大自由，我們看見有各地天主敎會人士對南斯拉夫總主敎事件致其譴責。</p>
<p>共產主義，論其本質，實亦一種無神的「宗敎」。這種「宗敎」，與俄羅斯人濃烈的宗敎感相結合，使俄羅斯人益自覺其所負的使命。莫斯科有「第三羅馬」之號，而現在共產黨的國際中心就在莫斯科，這使俄羅斯人民感覺到他們負有以共產主義來「解放」全人類的神聖使命。所以當革命的狂潮退落的時候，當爲抵拒異族的入侵而有戰事，引起俄羅斯人民濃烈的宗敎的情緖的時候，俄羅斯正統敎會修道院出身的史達林，便又將俄羅斯正統敎會抓了過來，在政府所特設的正統敎會事務委員會監督指揮之下，正式做了共產主義的御用機關。莫斯科宗主敎府Patriacha恢復了，在政府支持之下，又有正統敎會神學院的設立，早期共產主義時代的反宗敎是消滅了；起而代之的，却是共產主義與俄羅斯正統教會的打成一片。</p>
<p>原來基督敎會創立以來，其中心即在羅馬。異族入侵羅馬以後，羅馬的敎會，不但未見衰落，反而益見興盛。整個西歐在那悠長的所謂「黑暗時代」，只有羅馬敎會纔是一種安定的勢力。羅馬帝室的東遷，使羅馬敎會能够進入政敎分離的純宗敎境界。在東方的敎會，却反而時時不能離開政治的覊絆；所以東方的所謂正統敎會便一向爲政治所操縱。講到這個「統」，這個所謂「正統」，是這樣的。在東羅馬帝國時代，因爲帝都在比塞丁穆，君士坦了堡變成了「第二羅馬」，這是是「正統」。等到東羅馬帝國爲土耳其人所減以後，俄羅斯人自承了「正統」，於是莫斯科有「第三羅馬」之號。其實，照虔信基督敎的人們看來，「正統」敎會的統却不是「　統，」——這還是在羅馬，今日羅馬天主敎會信衆逾四萬萬，就可知敎會所謂「聖統」的所寄。惟其如比，所以「第三羅馬」的莫斯科，認爲羅馬還是它最終的敵人。</p>
<p>羅馬敎宗是一個不擁有武力的全世界公敎信衆的精神領袖。這次有南斯拉夫少女企圖行刺的消息傳來，實在有點突兀。現在此項報道，旣沒有官方的表示，自有待於證實。至於南斯拉夫總主敎的處刑，這裏或不免有政治關係存乎其間。隨着共產主義勢力的擴張，我們却到處可以看見有「第三羅馬」與羅馬的鬥爭。決定人類將來命運的一個最重要的因素怕就是這種鬥爭的結果吧！</p>
<h3>僑務經費少得可憐！</h3>
<p>英國人驕傲地說「日出之處有英國旗」；我們也可挽起大姆指講，「海水到處有華僑」。本來我們華南有句流行話，「閩粵無田，以海爲田」，無怪一千二百萬的華僑遍佈了全世界尤其是南洋幾成了「海外的中華民國」。然而我們的海外骨肉呆，白人目爲牛馬，本國視作「莠民」。所以日本殖民專家長永正義對華僑有這樣一句話，「國弱民强」，這裏深深地暗示着多少感慨！</p>
<p>視華僑爲「莠民」是昏聵的淸朝統治者說出口的，可是就在這個昏聵的朝廷裏却設立了廣州·廈門·天津·寗波各處的出洋問訊局，這件事還在民國紀元前五十餘年即咸豐九年。低能的北京政府也於民七年在國務院設置僑工事務局，十一年改設僑務局。今日的僑務委員會已是滄海桑田第七次的變遷了！這是秉承國父護僑政策，經中央政治會議決議而於二十一年改組成立直屬於行政字。它的存在性是天經地義的需要，絲毫壽命沒有比道個更長，而且首長始終未動，這要感謝主席的賢明，又要歸功該曾首長主持有方。</p>
<p>二十一年，該會成立之秋，正値國步艱難，他們每月僅領經常費八千元，不及原預算十分之四，他們職員只拿到雜持最低限度的生活費，當時叫它「國難薪」。二十二年六月，全會經費增至一萬八千，二十三年改增爲二萬三千，二十六年達二十八萬抗戰軍興，全部經費打了七折。二十八年，後方物價高漲。始恢復原來預算。三十三年經臨各費共一千六百萬。</p>
<p>本年度的原預算經常費生活補助費聞約一三六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，本業費五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。事業費與經常費的比例約佔百分之三。調整後的預算經常費及生活補助費約一，三〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，事業費仍照舊，它的百分比落到點二六。</p>
<p>它們的附屬機關，如上海·雲南兩個僑務處全年經費不過各得二十九萬，福建·廣東的僑務處十八萬五千，所有的僑務局每年各局不過十三萬，有的局每年祗七千塊老錢，華僑通訊社月約二萬，其他附屬機關亦僅僅數萬，調整後最多加了四倍，這些戔戔之數一個人也不够用，怎麽成機關辦事業？</p>
<p>僑務復員，該會早在三年前制定了戰後僑務籌備辦法，三十二年春組設機構，聘請有關機關代表四十五人參加，開過大會十數次，小會議不知其數，各種方案編製專册兩種，可謂應有盡有，於去年未勝利前好幾個月分送中央設計局及行政院。今年八月間一部分的復員計劃業已批准，而復員經費迄分文未有着落，至於結購外匯更不消說了。僑胞們破碎的家庭·學校·店廠·田園無款救濟，派出云的敎師殉難在外無錢撫恤，派出去活在的人流落異邦嗷嗷待哺，欠他們的戰期薪金無法支付，這還成什麽體統？還配談同人家競爭嗎？要知革命是由海外革成功的，人家也在抄老文章，我們覺醒沒有？</p>
<p>我們從各方面打聽出僑務經費的數字，實在令人有些不相信，可是無情的鐵一般的事實擺在面前：僑務經費是多麼可憐的少啊，而僑務的事情又多麼緊張的要做啊！目前事業費只有五百萬，佔全會經費百分之點二六，這究竟是什麼一個算盤？辦僑務的人員多嗎？不見得。堂堂中央一個大會工作人員不過七十，有時有科長而無科負，有時有科員而無科長，主持者牽蘿補屋可想而知。國民黨全會議決案和主席命令要辦的僑務連得院長秘書長等都不知道而一筆勾銷，辦會計的權力實在太大一些吧！</p>
<p>國家支出已由統治者私人的隨心所欲而進步到增進公共福利的公家支出，其不同點在前者係量人爲出，而後者則量出爲入。國家支出效果一爲生產的，一爲非生產的。生產的支廿在社會經濟上或人民福利上發生有益之效果。非生產的支田則無益於經濟的效果即屬廠耗浪費。僑務經費明明是生產的支出，而且是最有效果的投資，今天投資一文，明天可得十文二十文，例如獎勵僑生回國升學、祖國給他四五千元獎學金，但是他帶來的僑滙何止此數？</p>
<p>僑委會是國家的機關，是　家構成的部分，用以表明國家的人格。國家人格依機關而表現，機關表現的好歹，固然原因很多，而經費分配得當與否却是一個大主因。現在辦僑務設了機關，用了人，而只做五百萬的事業，我們相信任你三頭六臂辦不出什麽大事業來的，那末三萬萬的經常費與生活補助費化了豈非可惜，對於國家人格的表現豈非大受影響。</p>
<p>泰來（Frederic　W．Taylor）首創「科學的管理」，今日已形成「管理的科學」，目的無非在增進效率。我們希望政府健全預算審核制度，毋讓只見錢不懂事的人操生殺大權。千百萬萬的預算要議愼些，幾子萬的不必太苛刻！一個月的調　活動動軌十萬萬二十萬萬；學生不滿百的一個學校自滇遷渝，自渝遷京一用使是十多萬萬，照此情形國家何必吝嗇幾個僑務事業費？管子曰：「黃金刀幣，民之通施也，故善者執其通施，以御其司命，故民力可得而盡也。」望當局思之重思之！</p>

<h3>各小國向蘇挑戰　一致反對否決權　美主張自由討論一切問題　八助理秘書長昨宣誓就職</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿五日廣播：出席聯合國大會之蘇聯代表團，企圖阻止大會討論五強在安理會中之否決權問題，但在美國堅決反對之下，其勢必將趨於失敗。由十四國代表組成之總務委員會，將討論議程問題，目下暫定者計有五十三項，其中三項係有關否決權者，即澳洲主張限制五強之否決權，而古巴則提出兩項建議，主張根本將憲章中之否決權一項取消。蘇聯代表維辛斯基堅持否決權問題不予討論，而美國則認爲在大會中任何問題，均應有充分討論之權利，雙方相持不下，必有一番熱烈演出。但蘇聯之主張，殊少貫澈之希望也。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿五日電〕聯大一般委員會，於昨夜熱烈辯論南非與印度人之　執後，臨時議程上僅餘兩項足以引起熱烈辯論之議案，即古巴之動議廢除否決權及澳大利亞之動議修正整個憲草，該兩事當於今日下午之會議中討論。同時全體大會亦定今日下午綱續舉行一般辯論。昨夜於辯論南非印度之問題時，蘇代表維辛斯蓋烏克爾代表曼紐斯基支持印度代表，反對南非總理史末資之建議撤銷臨時議程上之「南非聯邦印度人之待報問題」委員會最後通過建議大會，將該事交法律及政治兩委員會討論。英美兩國當反對蘇聯之建議撤銷議程上討論五強否決權之一項，美代表且將反對蘇聯之建議撤銷討論南非合併西南非案。若一般委員會拒絕接受古巴所提召開特別委會以討論撤銷否決權問題之建議，則古巴代表團可能退出聯合國。</p>
<p>〔綜合消息〕聯合國大會廿四晚舉行首次會議，秘書長賴依報告會務畢，比西　首席代表那吉拉即展開一般辯論，要求取消或修改安理會五常任理事國之否決權，調否決權有區聯入國之團結。菲律賓及古巴代表亦聲明反對否決權。古巴代表費爾特今日復向蘇聯作最後挑戰，婓氏提出兩項議案，要求修訂聯合國憲章，取消五強之否決權，希望能將此項提案列入議程。婓氏並向記者宣稱，聯合國大會，民主國佔多數，吾人倘不能自由表示意見及自由討論，則大會有何用處。巴西代表范羅索對安理會中濫用否決權，亦猛烈反對，據稱，「若謂大國利益衝突時，犧牲人類福利即爲合法，全世界絕不作此想法。舊金山會議時聯合各國所由贊成四強享有否決權者，彼等一心以爲保持和平職責所在，顧界予各大國若干特權，但此等國家必須不失信心而後可。秘魯代表附和巴西主張，據稱，否決權倘若濫用，勢必回復中世紀狀態，多數國家將無伸張公道之機會。此在比代表藍琪花夫則謂，安理會之任務乃在維持和平，但該會迄未研究足以危害和平之問題，余亦認爲安理會之一切失敗，均係由於某常任理事國濫用否決權所致。蘇聯對於劈頭打擊，保持緘默，惟態度甚爲堅決。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿四日專電〕聯合國大會第二次全體大會今晨舉行，八名助理秘書長正式就職。顧維鈞經大會主席斯巴克之請，就坐於懸有馳名之世界地圖之高台上。其後秘書長賴依介紹下列八名助理秘書長，負責安理會工作之蘇代表索布列夫，經濟工作之英代表歐文，社會工作之法代表勞傑埃，託管工作中國代表胡世澤，宣傳工作之智利代表柯恩，法律工作之捷克代表寇諾，會議及一般工作之荷代表畢爾特及行政與財政工作之美代表哈森，各人均向秘書長宣讀爲聯合國工作效忠之簡短聲明，「執行工作時，決不謀取或接受任何政府及聯合國以外方面之訓示」。宣誓時胡世澤用華語。</p>
<h3>秘書長報告會務　要求對弗朗哥採取行動　西班牙駐美使館指爲無理譭謗</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿四日電〕聯合國大會於今日下午四時十五分開會，今日之節目有任命助理秘書八名，由各代表提出證書，報告三委員會主席之當選，接受秘書長賴依之報告等，然後開始一般辯論。賴依之報告有謂：余不能不促使大會注意西班牙新政權之問題，安理會亦當詳細研究此一問題，其中牽涉之若干事項，且曾由社經理事會討論。聯合國機構其他組織可能亦受西班牙問題之牽涉。當德國與日本戰敗之後；法西斯勢力仍在西班牙握有控制權，誠爲令人不快之事。弗朗哥政權繼續存在，將成爲創立聯合國機構諸國間悮解之原因，因此本人希望彼曾經帶給吾人以勝利及和平之人，亦能設法恢復西班牙之自由及民主政府。賴氏繼述原子能委員會之工作進展稱，此項進展極爲有限而遲緩，在此一重大問題解決以前，世人決不能安睡，此乃聯合國機構之責任。關於聯合國機構在國際法內之地位，賴氏謂，紐倫堡之審判已創一先例，爲保護和平及人類計，紐倫堡審判可使用之原則，應儘速使其成爲國際法內永久性之規定。賴氏繼謂，戰事結束以來，各聯合國間已因和平而意見紛歧，聯合國憲章係以有適當的和平及諸強之堅定協議爲基礎，和約之訂立可使聯合國機構得一穩固之工作基礎，而消除許多妨礙工作進行之紛雜意見，使其得專心致力於保障穩定之和平，促進人民之福利。吾人若不能了解此一偉大之最後目標，全世界將不能饒恕我等。賴氏復述及人權問題稱，人權之保障爲憲章所規定，不幸有許多國家，甚至極進步之國家，亦不能使全部人民均有基本之人權。故吾人在世界各之婦女均能享受與男子相等之權利以前，決不可停止努力云。大會當決定以賴依之報告，安理會所將提出之報告及經濟社會理事會之報告作爲一般辯論之基礎。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕西班牙駐美大使館今日發表文告稱：「賴依之報告書，頗令人驚詫，吾人感覺將有一日」可知賴依所以抱此態度之秘密，且相信確有此秘密，否則賴依既對西班牙毫無所知，復與所謂「西班牙問題」絕無關係，決不敢有此無理譭謗。……如果聯合國秘書長企圖爲其若干友人之特殊利益，散怖濃厚之煙幕，……則吾人認爲此舉，不致成功。</p>

<h3>原子材料　管制複雜</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約　　湖廿四日電〕聯合國巨子能委會經這次非正式會議後，一致認爲原子材料釷原素之管制，較釷原素更爲困難。因釷礦之分佈廣大，開採規模亦較小，控制不易，加之釷原素常存在於其他礦物之間，故其管制更形複雜。</p>

<h3>邱吉爾響應艾德禮　嚴辭譴責共產黨　謂足破壞良好社會制度</h3>
<p>〔路透社英國魯登廿四日電〕邱吉爾今夜在此發表演說，響應艾德禮首相在工聯大會上抨擊英國共產主義之致辭。邱吉爾謂，英國政府與共黨脫離關係，對國外有重要而有益之結果，因歐陸若干國如法國等，今方掙扎於共產主義攻擊之下也。英政府此一立場，可以促成歐洲之穩定，堪爲許多國家之模楷。邱氏繼復述及渠於昨在下院中提出之嚴重警告謂，渠質問歐洲各地是否駐有二百師以上之蘇軍以前，曾加以鄭重之考慮，共可揭露之事實，有證據可證其確實。邱氏復謂史遠林於若干月前所用以青驚邱氏之言，均爲希特勒或郭培爾所常用之語。邱氏繼謂，英國之共產黨目前尚不足成爲政治之主要目標，故猶不值得全國之注意，然法國之共產思想，刻正在可怖地滋長中。法國生命之復興已受其威脅，在任何共產政府之下，共產制度爲一極權制度，足以破壞自由及良好之社會制度。希臘經公正而自由之公民選舉後，已躍出共產主義馬爾幹集團之危險。邱氏於批評之政府內政政策後，乃謂，艾德禮能用此等言語以譴責共產宣傳，正合我意，余覺我國毫未受共產宣傳之影響云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕前首相邱吉爾昨日下議院發問時稱，蘇聯在歐洲駐紥軍隊兩百師之多，頃據「倫敦泰晤士報」駐莫斯科訪員來電稱，外國軍事專家認爲邱吉爾所提出之數字，言過其實。</p>

<p>首相又謂，世界局勢悲劇之一，即爲蘇聯政府似正故意阻止蘇聯人民與他國人民交往，蘇報紙亦發表對世界他部之歪曲見解，因此國與國間乃產生不解與猜疑之鴻溝。今日之工聯大會，以大多數通過決議，要求英政府與弗朗哥政府斷絕一切經濟外交關係。同時對批評英政府對西班牙希臘德國及蘇聯等外交政策之決議則予否決。</p>

<p>〔改造社東京廿五日電〕麥帥今日就菲律賓現狀發表談話稱：六月間菲律賓獨立以來，駐菲美軍司令報告謂，美菲開戰時之堅固的同志結合刻己低下。美軍一部分新兵不負責任，通商奪權，戰災之復元，復員將士之權利，以及救濟問題等等，乃此種感情發生原因之一。然根本原因更在深處。多數菲人縱有友好之意，對外國軍隊駐在其首都馬尼刺，感覺不懌，結果事態頓形巨大。麥帥又對「駐日美軍士氣如何」之質問答稱：余所直接指揮之日本佔領軍，戰鬥訓練不足，兵力甚弱，官兵人數亦在標準以下，然除自然之思鄉病外，目不士氣紀律可謂至佳，余不復能有所要求。</p>

<h3>兵役局長在京招待記者　證實上海兵役緩辦　並表示此次征兵僅爲補充缺額　文華技術工人可暫免召</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕兵役局長徐思平，廿五日答覆記者詢問時，證實上海役政之辦理將預延緩，並表示技術工人與文化工人等可暫免召，商店經理等將來入伍時，不作普通兵用，而將令其担任軍需等工作，不致使其本身特長全部埋沒。據稱：當局對上海及京渝等地役政之辦理，極爲鄭重，蓋上述三地人口較多，辦理時當然亦將較其他地點爲難，故特別延緩兵役，同時對上述地點有關役政之人事機構法令與調查，亦特別愼重，並限於本年內完成戶籍調查工作。就兵役法原則而言：征兵爲一普遍性者，惟目前之征召，僅爲缺額補充，其用意祗在補育部隊中少數復員退伍或老弱士兵之缺額，且僅爲征兵而非征「官』，亦非軍事技術人員之補充，全國征兵何時普遍實施，日期未定。征兵數額將極微少，甚至不到戰時十分之一，或廿分之一。京滬團管區司令人選當局極重視，現尙難得其選。另一高級兵役人員亦謂兵役法僅爲一基本法，與兵役有關之其他廿餘種法令尙未擬定公佈，故眞正兵役辦理，恐將有待。上海市當局所提斟酌延緩該地兵役之請求，當局正作考慮中。徐局長今日於記者招待席上致詞：對新兵役法之特點解釋極詳，並說明此次恢復征兵，係平時性者，而非戰時性。據稱以前之兵役法所征之對象爲「兵」而不提及「官」，同時國家因限於經費，士兵待遇又壞，因之一般人民咸圖逃避兵役，乃有種種弊端發生，而新兵役法加入軍官佐役，軍士役，及陸海空軍兵役，兵役範圍擴大，國家對人民之需要視其素質而定，學醫者可担任醫官工作，學工者可担任築橋修路工作，務使才得其用，同時緩征緩召範圍，亦較過去爲縮小，（以前有一百十餘種）使其服義務平等普及。</p>
<h3>福煦路成都路口　警匪大格鬥　五盜全部成擒　其一畏罪自殺</h3>

<p>聞本市所利得稅繳納標準及辦法，業經決定。據直接稅署長王撫洲談；本人指導上海直接稅局辦理稽征本年度所得稅，採取三項原則，一力避苛擾，二使商民所納每一分稅款，均入到國庫，三嚴防逃漏。本此三項原則，所以第一對於依法如期申報之商號，不再查帳，第二使商家所繳稅款之數字，與審査會所核定之數字，直接稅局所通知之數字，以及國庫所收到之數字，要完全符合，第三對於不守法的商號，則只有依法制裁。凡不依法如期申報者，或由報旣晚，所報又不實者，或希圖逃稅者，當派員査賬，照各業最高標準逕行決定，或移送法院嚴予處罰。</p>

<h3>上海扒窃的黑幕（六）</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>「跑底子」帮終日徜徉碼頭，耳目衆多。有些船上的小僱員，也往往與此輩暗通聲氣，居然以鎮政府間諜」的姿態發送密碼暗號，敲詐成功後，也可以分得一份。該帮靠着這份「買路綫」過日子，自是長袖善舞，吃着不盡。因此在「老弟兄」帮派中，應推「跑底子」帮最有出息，而其組織亦最嚴密，且富有「自治精神」。</p>
<p>「跑垃圾」——這帮簡直是「跑底子」帮附屬下的淸道夫。從事於此者都是些較無出息的「蔗末一之流。那些開設在碼頭附近的店舖行家，都是化　時常光顧的地方。主要的是那些海味行，鮮　　行，水菓行，食料店等，他們乘人不備，便順手偸竊，貴賤多少不計。竊得便拿去販賣，如被常塲捉獲，他們便裝出哀求的表情，哭笑工夫全套演出，結果挨打了事，有時由「爺叔」輩出來打圍，自然也可以大事化小了。</p>
<p>浪裏白條習諳水性</p>
<p>關於「水老鼠」一帮，原亦隸屬於「扒竊黨」的範圍內。此帮弟兄習諳水性，原是永浒傳中「翻江鼠」「浪裏白條」一類的流亞，他們平日或是划船捕魚，或是代人打撈江心失物，表而上似屬正當生活，但暗地地裏却在水中爲非作惡，乘機作竊。帮中切口爲「鑽底子」，即是潛業船艙行竊，或呌「水活驚」，便是潛伏在水中乘機行竊。在黃浦江中，每日經常停泊着的大小船隻，爲數極多，即以鐵鍊舵錨而論，也時常給此業水老鼠所偸竊。老經騐的船戶，爲求安全計，向例每月都有孝敬錢付給水鼠帮的「爺叔輩子」，如有不願賞給的，爺叔使命令水老鼠大事搗蛋，或截斷鐵錨，或損毁船底，使其損失不貲。這　陋規。按月統計起來，自然是十分可觀的。</p>
<p>街頭駐局別人有一功</p>
<p>在上海的街頭，時常發現各種騙局，他們用極簡單的方法誘人人彀，這便是「載頭戲」帮玩出來的鬼把戲。「截頭戲」也是「扒竊黨」分支下的一個帮派，他們雖然比不上「吃壞飯」帮的積極扒錢，但是利用消極的手法誘詐路人的血汗錢，表面上是完全處於神動的地位。其能耐精神可說另有一功，因爲經營比業者，都是帮黨中的老奸巨猾，設局街上，讓人上常。</p>
<p>「戳頭戲」的花樣頗多，每次上街，都有一個小組，合夥活動，其人數的自三四人至十餘人不等。現存的統稱爲「橋樑架子」，凡是一切支設本架在路旁做騙錢生意的都包括在內。茲分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）「朝天印」——在街沿支太架賭牌九，引路人人局，以便詐欺取財。</p>
<p>（二）「葉子」——即玩檏克的葉子戲，引誘路人下注猜測牌中的克老人頭，以巧妙手法，使人無從提摸，十九可以取勝。但若路人猜中了，他們便藉端爭吵翻臉，決不會讓下注者佔了便宜。</p>
<p>（三）「棋攤」——即在路沿設象棋攤，排好一個殘局，故佈疑陣，使紅黑兩棋，皆有可勝的機會，引人入局。懂得象棋的人到處皆有，而且下棋的人，總自命好手，往往技癢，一較勝負，然而他們是讀熟棋譜的，路人那裏是他們的對手，所以結果總是路人輸錢。</p>
<p>（四）「化黃貨」——支架路沿以售賣假貨，如金飾，古玩、珠玉，銅貨的僞品等都屬之。</p>
<p>（五）「活絡棺材」——在牆壁上縣掛着布字招牌，賣物賣藥，或是傳授各種奇術戲法，信口開河，其行跡很和走江湖的差不多。</p>
<p>（六）一假病售藥」——在街沿售藥贈醫，本來是江湖醫生的宣傳方式。但江湖中儘有不少正料靈藥，「戳頭戲」帮則是純粹滑頭本色，拾取江湖帮的外表，出售假藥騙錢。並以夥伴冒充生病的路人，作爲公開試騐，藉以取信於路人。於是僞藥便可以當塲暢銷。</p>
<p>（七）「對買」——在街頭出售置質的金錶銀具之類，串通夥伴爲路人，對貿講價還價，以引誘　瓜入彀。</p>
<p>（八）「凑元寳」——遇轄區內有貧病路斃者，帮中弟兄便趕到塲來，表演「親視含殮」的哭泣鏡頭，一而向附近人家兜施棺材掩埋，集腋成裘，凑成元寳之後，便溜之大吉，結果路屍仍待善堂去掩埋。</p>

<h3>倫道爾案上訴開審　兩造辯護律師一塲舌戰　沈克間諜工作曾獲重酬　被上訴人謂新聞有根據　消息均爲美軍公布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕德籍軍事間諜嫌疑犯沈克，以本年四月十六日。字林西報曾刊有美國合眾通訊社消息，稱沈兄曾奉德間諜機關之命，赴渝揭露聯合國地下工作人員情形，並探索聯合國人士進入內地路綫，認爲在誹謗行爲，遂於日前向地院對合眾社駐華辦事處主任倫道爾提出自訴，業經宣告倫道爾無罪，沈克不服，遂向高院提起上訴，業於昨晨開審，調查證據，推事王健論於十一月二日上午續審。</p>
<p>上訴人沈兄因尚羈押提籍橋監獄，由姚肇第律師代表出庭，倫道爾仍由陳霆銳律師担任辯護，並由合眾社記者袁倫仁君翻譯。旁聽席上人滿爲患，尤以新聞界爲多，各報記者有鵠立紀錄者。</p>
<p>新聞來源·美軍發表</p>
<p>倫道爾稱：此稿確係彼所撰寫，至此項新聞之來源，則係根據美軍總部情報處所發表之文件，且担任調查德國戰犯之檢察官，曾舉行記者招待會，當即曾將此事發表。庭上遂問：能證明否？答：此訊係根據當局發表，可以證明，現已備有美軍總部所發之證明書，並有担任調查戰犯案之美檢察官二人簽名，此二人即召開記者招待會者，簽名前並曾宣誓，以昭鄭重。</p>
<p>是時陳律師即起而補充，並宣讀證明書全文，略謂四月十六日，此二檢察觀曾全權代表美國陸軍，于可靠證件內，（按「可靠證件」之原文實爲Evidence　now　on　file）知沈克實係於一九四二年由德國軍事情報機關歐哈德局派遣來華，以任德國記者爲掩護，偵查聯合國秘密工作人員之行動，並探聽聯合國人士潛赴內地之路綫。陳氏旋將證明書呈上。</p>
<p>記者招待會上　曾經公開宣布</p>
<p>法官旋詢問此記者招待會究於何日舉行，因證明書所載之開會日期爲四月十六，而十六日之字林西報已刊登此訊，則倫氏撰此稿時，必在十六日之前也。倫氏答稱：此稿係十五日午後所寫，尚趕及於當日之英文大美晚報刊出。且確係根據是日上午舉行之記者招待會，因除合眾社外，聯合社及中文報紙亦曾參加該會，發稿時字句亦幾全部相同。</p>
<p>時姚肇第律師即駁稱：倫道爾所提出之證明書，日期係十月二十四日，似係專供今日開庭之用。證明書中Evidence　nov　on　jlie（現存證據）一語，所指之證據或並非四月十六日以前所得，而係最近得到。四月十六日記者招待會上所發佈新聞之內容究竟如何，本人要求傳美軍法庭檢察官出庭說明。</p>
<p>中印輪油管　沈克有情報</p>
<p>陳律師立即起稱：如上訴人認爲證明書之證明力量不足，則今日調查庭若不結束者，被告方面自可請美軍法庭檢察官出庭！且除此之外，尚有「官文書」可作新的證明。沈克間諜案共犯魯道夫于審訊時曾良心發現，供出真情，謂歐哈德局曾僱用間諜，而此等間諜復雇用國籍不同之助手，此項間諜中，最得力者有三人，第一人即爲沈克。彼將得自日本方面之情報供給中國內地來滬之情報員，又將內地情報供給德國，此實危險萬分之工作，而沈克竟能勝任愉快。此項交付德國之情報，多由日方負責聯絡之高島博士自歐哈德局轉送日本情報負責當局。其中最珍貴之情報，爲報告中印間輪油管之興築，此訊後即供給日方。沈克爲時局分析專家，對國府人事調動，輙能指出其意義所在。此外，沈克所獲美軍情報亦多。又一同案犯柯興亦稱：沈克在歐哈德局所得薪給之巨，亦爲全局之冠，月得三千八百金馬克（時價每二個半金馬克等於美金一元），而歐哈德本人每日所得僅一千二百五十金馬克。</p>
<p>原告津師　反覆辯論</p>
<p>是時姚律師又駁稱：魯道夫曾言上述供詞，實係逼供，有書面「反證明」提出。陳律師即稱，前項供詞曾當庭由魯道夫簽字在卷，究竟詳情如何，可問魯道夫本人。</p>
<p>姚律師遂指稱被告方面之答覆已越出題外，本案範圍至爲明確，祇被告在字林西報所提關於沈克之兩點事實。沈克現尚在審判中，未經判決，是否有罪，尚不可知。被告律師現强调美军法庭云云，彷彿以爲一爲壤人，即可隨便侮辱，此在中國法庭，實屬不堪容忍。即使沈克將來判罪，亦並不影響本案被告之有罪或無罪！</p>
<p>此時倫道爾能覺焦躁不耐，忿然稱：此證明書中已明白說明沈克之活動爲調查聯合國在滬地下工作活動情形，並偵察聯合國人士潛往內地之途徑。且聯合社及其他報紙皆有相同報道，上訴人何以獨控訴彼本人一人，實爲可怪。知自美軍法庭所取來之正式證明書尚不能認爲有價值，豈沈克所提出之證據反有價值乎？</p>
<p>姚律師稱：本案可俟美軍法庭對沈克判決後再爲判決，上訴人方面並無成見；此案情節較小第二審即爲最後一審，敬請鄭重考慮。</p>
<p>下月二日續審</p>
<p>陳律師即稱：本案之　結在於被告是否虛構事實。被告之報道旣係根據美軍所發佈，則即使有誹謗之處，責任亦不在被告，而在美軍部。此等涉外案件，爲公道計，盼能早予結束，因外僑有刑事案件牽連時，不能隨便出國，而被告身爲新聞記者，隨時有出國可能也。至是，王推事遂論於十一月二日上午十時續審。</p>

<h3>方治招待新聞界　希望聯繫合作宣揚國策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市黨部主任委員方治昨日下午三時假麗都花園茶會招待本市新聞界，至各報社來賓百餘人。</p>
<p>方氏即席致詞稱：今日招待意義有兩點：一爲本人過去與新聞界有密切關係，民七加入國民黨之時即係工作於葉楚傖先生主持之民國日報中，今日上海新聞界不少人士均係本人老友，此次能來上海與新舊友人見面，非常愉快，並願向各位請教。二爲此次本人宣誓前後，承各報著論立評，嚴勉有加，因此特表謝意。今日並乘此機會提出幾點意見：（一）希望黨部與新聞界密切聯繫，因黨爲民眾服務，新聞界則是人民喉舌，同以人民爲對象。（二）希望黨員與報人密切聯繫，蓋雙方均係以文字工作，古人所謂以文會友，以友輔仁。（三）聯繫目的在於爲實現三民主義爲宣揚國策政令爲擁護和平統一而奮鬥努力，吾人應求統一的和平，統一的民主，亦即民主的統一，民主的和平。如內亂不止，則無和平無統一亦無民主可言。自歷史上看，筆桿之力量實較槍桿強大，辛亥革命及北伐之成功即爲明證，今後建國過程尤靠筆桿宣揚策勵，黨部方面最近擬舉行黨員總登記，並將積極關揚國父遣教，希望新聞界共同合作云。</p>
<p>方氏詞畢，王芸生，趙敏恒，萬梅子等相繼發言，對於黨務方針貢獻意見。最後方氏結束其招待會稱：今後市黨部決以政黨方式爲人民服務，以革新精神辦理黨務云。</p>

<h3>配紗辦法已商定　複製品業設立聯合機構</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡織布業管理委員會由吳兼主委主持，對各綿紗複製品工業配　棉紗一萬二千〇四件半，其配售手續，昨由六區棉紡公會及紡建公司代表會同機器染織業等六公會代表，在漢口路紡建公司會議室，詳加商討，由紡建公司業務處副處長蔣　先主席，常決定配紗總額，分兩次配淸，（即十月二十八日（星期一）與十一月四日星期一）由各紗廠於每星期一，將各支別商標棉紗及價格，分別繕製表格，提交棉紡公會，同時將攤出棉紗，掣發預約單，各復製品工業公會，根據配紗表，分配於會員客戶，同時造表送交棉紡公會，公會即憑表換發預約單，承配工廠，憑單備款向紗廠換取棧單，於十天內出淸。</p>
<p>又本市機器染織針織內衣毛巾被毯手帕手工綿織等六複製品工業同業公會，爲執行承配棉紗工作，取得密切聯絡起見，昨日下午五時在染織業公會召開各業公會聯席會議，各公曾代表全體出席，由潘士浩主席，先由上午出席紡管會會議之代表報告商談配紗丰續經過，　公議設立常設聯合機構，定名曰上海市棉紗複製品工業公會配紗委員會，當推選正副主任委員，及審查領配評價三組長，以期順利推進配紗工作云。</p>
<h3>紗廠存棉如不敷三個月可以申請結滙購買美棉</h3>
<p>吳市長日前晋京面謁宋院長，對於美棉結匯問題有所請示後，據悉宋院長已表示准予恢復結匯，吳市長乃決定凡各紗廠現有存綿，不足三個月之需者，均可申請購買美棉結匯，惟爲明暸實况起見，除令由棉花商業同業公會，於本月二十八日前，將現有存棉實數報告紡管會外，同時並製定表格，調查各廠生產情形，需用棉花種類及數量，統限於一星期將調查表塡送，如有以多報少者，其額外存棉一律沒收，過期不報者，即作爲放棄權利，據悉：目前各紗廠存棉十分之九以上，均不足敷三個月之需，照目前情形，至少需要訂　美棉二百萬担云。</p>
<h3>債市閑散</h3>
<p>公債昨呆滯，求供不一，且以零散居主體，是以起仆殊微，統丙晨開二〇三〇元，開後曾站定放二〇五〇元者稍久，後以股市不振，買氣稍减，曾破入二〇〇〇元大關，惟最後仍站二〇五〇元左右，結果較前收無甚榮辱，甲乙升二十元，丁種平平，統戊　好八〇元。</p>
<h3>米麥繼疲油價挺秀</h3>
<p>米市客貨登記九千餘石，消化依然不爽北粳高平次呆南粳中次仿然下挫千元，秈米中下等受主稀少，步跌千元，白元疲疲，陰元再削二三千元，油市來貨稀少。物稀爲貴，生油豆汕應市者少，僅淸油略有成交，價格則向高峯猛進，豆餅汕頭成交尙旺，廠方儘量供應，回跌三五百元，小麥胄呆不動，再跌一二千元，黃豆來貨尙續，勢難向榮，續挫千元，菉豆來去兩稀，苞米不振，生仁本街零化見活，價形挺秀，黃蔴南洋續辦，再升一二千元。</p>
<h3>客戶承購油餅一律須用本票</h3>
<p>本市榨油工柴同業公會，以據該會會負申請，嗣後凡客戶向該業各廠承購油餅，打棧單時，一律須用銀行或錢莊本票，特函各有關公會知照，以昭鄭重。</p>
<h3>禁止小麥轉口　江海關業已公告實施麵粉配售每日九千包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自行政院訓令禁止小麥轉口後，本市江海關，業於廿四日公告實施。自該日起，凡由江海關報動轉口之小麥，應與麵粉一律須先經糧食部之核准。但養後救濟總署運出之小麥，則不在此限。據麵粉業方面人士表示：目前滬市小麥存底，己極枯涸。自禁止轉口令賓施後，市價每担已跌至三萬元。麵粉業公會方面，仍按本市每日麵粉之消費量，配售九千包予麵粉商，再由此轉配予各餅饅業。茲悉：本市湯　·切麵·漿糊各業，亦呈請社會局，轉飭公會酌予配售。聞該公會以每日配售量，僅限九千包，擬掃數交予社會局統籌核配云。</p>
<h3>中絲開闢海外銷路　法國洽談頗有成就　美國市塲未可樂觀</h3>
<p>〔太報訊〕中絲公司正努力開闢海外生絲銷塲，近與法國接治，頗有成就，聞法國需絲甚殷，其提出之價格，較之美國爲高。此外在南洋一帶，亦有接洽。有資格人士指出，我國對生絲在美國之銷路，不能抱過於樂觀之期望。因目前美國若干財閥，實際上已控制日本之絲業，因此對於生絲之市價，一再予以壓低。其次則中美兩國物價上漲之速度，相差過甚，今日美國雖有通貨膨脹，但物價上漲不出三倍，而生絲之售價，已由民國廿六年之每磅二美元漲至七百美元，故銷路自然不暢。又政府對生絲之外銷，具有決心，即使成本較之他國爲高時，亦將採補貼政策，使其大量外銷，　以保持海外市塲云。</p>
<h3>散戶點綴市塲··華股大勢難振</h3>
<p>華股昨土塲微穩，但買氣仍極有限，不久又告下游，晨開時各股稍告開高，但不久賣戶陸續活動，塲內並無新買活動，在零散之買戶點綴下，局勢無力開展，廣帮稍有購買，中途由低稍　，無如大勢難振，檯面帮　機放空，易跌難升，近午美亞再創新低價，臨收浮空稍補，套利者略來活動，低後略告　升，午收較前收熱股永紗信和新光微挫，美亞景福勤興各跌半成左右，冷股統益榮豐麗安景綸平平，餘者均告下挫，午後因有兩天利息關係，開出即好，但前進之途，遭逄高套利者吐出而被阻，漸漸　小，惟臨收散多，仍有活動，尙形穩定，結果較前收熱股計永紗景福新光勤興美亞微降，信和獨告微升，冷股計中紡大通中絲火柴公司五利內衣均跌半成左右，統益榮豐新亞　安平平，水泥華豐微降，總成交額六七三萬股，塲外各股平定少變。</p>
<p>外股初平後疲，迄難振作，交易不多，市况閑散，結果較前收計怡紗英聯業廣紙業各告微挫，會德豐航業鋼業怡啤各跌半成左右。</p>
<h3>金價賡續上升··外幣平穩逾恒</h3>
<p>烚赤昨賡續向榮，惟逢高壓力有加，稍多盤旋，晟開二二五萬五，開後即自二二五萬，逐漸轉穩，但起仆有限，延至十時徒央行以二二五萬二五之價配給一百條此後客銷仍殷，銀根更　，曾步升至二二六萬以上，而後壓力加重，近午　挫至二二五萬以下，午刻仍站二二五萬五左右，午後隔日交割仍告向榮，曾升至二二七萬而後稍平，結果較前收再升一萬二，飾金掛升至念四萬，紋銀平而銀元微升，暗拆銀根更鬆，息價退至一角二分左右。</p>
<p>美鈔門市交易並不開展，暗市中約四一三〇元至四一八〇元，結果較前收稍漲，港票因金價關係，略告向榮，昨八九〇元左右頗多賣買，結果較前收稍漲，港匯價亦相彷彿，報八八五元至八九五元，印匯一〇七〇元有成交，英匯一四一〇〇元至一四三〇〇元，美匯掛牌未更，仍無對做。</p>
<h3>絲價大致已定　七七公分尙成問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕收購生絲之價格，經有關機關會商後，什九將不再加以變動。昨日中央銀行之集會，主嬰在討論七七公分之生絲，是否作D級計算，或作E級計算，因在美國，D級爲七八公分，我國如依此標準收購，絲商之收益將减少一部份。據某專家告記　：在美國，絲每級不禍差十一萬元，現我國爲十七萬五千元，對絲商實已甚爲優厚云。</p>
<h3>金山枝回漲</h3>
<p>金山枝近以去化轉活，而產價提升，故此間號　亦因之隨緊，昨市高莊元枝開廿四萬六千元至廿五萬元，扁枝二十五萬二千元，比前升一成之譜。</p>
<h3>紗布均告回落　布廠轉有吐售　彩魁見新低價</h3>
<p>〔太報訊〕昨日紗市仍無起色，同行心思淡泊之至，特雙馬直綫下降，收盤跌至二百卅萬，較昨小五萬，其餘各支亦極不振，無不跌落二萬至六萬，尤以大生紗廠之紅魁彩魁汗牛充棟，　售者衆，彩奎一度降至二百〇一萬，爲近來之最低價，四十二支去化尤滯，各布廠反見吐售，價均固小。</p>
<p>自紡管會對於紗布價格之平抑，一再召集會議，切實計義以來，市價已告平穩，加以棉紗聯合配銷，繼續舉辦，布市亦因而逐步下降，近數日來，本埠號商因銀根關係，進胃頗呆，昨日高檔細布如紡建之五福藍鳳，均七萬六千成交，士林布雖顏料飛漲，但布價甚爲乏力，仁豐廠出品之蘭亭一九〇號士林，開十二萬五千元，大陸出品之大鹿閰土林，開十二萬元，其他各貨亦不無疲落。</p>
<h3>喊價雖高成交甚少　人絲黑市已成弩末</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲市，上千頗形穩定，下午突呈向上，一二〇號天橋老貨有光，最高喊到三百七十萬元，雜牌等貨逐被抬高，一二〇號金三馬有光三百四十八萬元有成交，雜牌半光喊三百〇五萬元，比上日大起十萬元，不過交易甚少，廠經亦頗平靜，ＤＥ等級，較上日喊高五萬元，干經介未動，全日成交祇十餘担，綢貨觀望，實因客幫並無大量採辦，而本市各綢緞店，生意亦甚清淡，有以致之。</p>
<h3>燃管會配給煤　將調整售價？　台煤運滬漸多</h3>
<p>據燃料管理委員會方面消息，外傳該會將於下月起調整配售之煤價，但工業廠用煤，爲維護生產，決定並不變更，每噸仍爲十四萬元，至配發數量，則視到貨情形而定，目下煤觔來源已漸轉陽達，工業用煤當可無處缺乏。</p>
<p>據悉台灣煤礦，已接管者計有二十廠，開工者十二廠，另八廠尙未復工，開工各廠之生產量，逐有增加，目前上海台灣間運輸頗爲便利，平均每月均有二三艘互輸專運台省物資來滬，其中以煤爲大宗，聞台省尙有十三萬五千　公噸之煤，候輸運滬。</p>
<h3>紅米產價步升</h3>

<h3>中國銀行開辦原幣匯款　半月來成績尙佳　惟國幣僑匯則相對減少</h3>
<p>我國爲人超數字極龐大之國家，以華僑匯款抵補外匯，向佔重要地位，過云南洋華橋匯入數字甚鉅，目前則英美華僑躍升首位，在本年三月四日以前，統制外匯時期，僑匯由中國銀行獨家經營，開放以後，外國銀行亦多經營，華僑匯款因而走漏極多，其主要路綫厥唯香港，其次則爲需要外匯之銀行，其走漏數字，基於中國銀行統計而言，在統制時期之去年十月份共匯入十億零九百餘萬元，可折合五四五萬美金，而本年七月份則僅三十八億餘元，折合美金不及二百萬元，兩者相較，可知外匯漏失數字之鉅</p>
<p>自外匯開放，外國銀行經營僑匯，中國銀行即擬辦原幣匯款，惟限於政府銀行不得辦原幣匯款，惟限於政府銀行不得經營外幣，及目前一般趨勢誠恐外幣匯到後，不來結匯提取，故遲未實施，後經詳加統計調查，確知僑匯之來源百分之八十爲接濟家用，不致長存銀行，乃於雙十節開始辦理原幣匯款，據中國銀行方面消息，辦理以來，半月間每日數字雖不甚鉅，但日有增加，惟整個僑匯，並不因此而增加，蓋原幣匯款增多，即國幣僑匯減少也。</p>
<h3>生鐵飛漲　定貨不久可到</h3>
<p>數月以來，生鐵定貨到滬，因　耗甚鉅，致各鐵行未向英美等國訂購已久，致滬地存貨稀薄，價格激烈上升，十餘日間，每噸竟由七十萬元漲至一百八十萬元，超過洋板鐵及熱鐵等售價甚鉅，開最近將有定貨到埠，市價當可轉趨平定。</p>
<h3>海林棒市貨缺乏</h3>
<p>海林棒盛行至今，屈指已有十七八年，在八一三後，舶來品絕跡，國產本廠貨問世，但爲原料及行銷關係，逐年減少，同時本街買方需要亦乏，致最近兩年內形成需供均寂之象，自去年勝利以來，客幫需胃驟盛，因各地呢料空荒，海林棒遂又爲人注意，致有限之陳貨，相繼售　，　來市貨缺乏，銷路則殊爲暢達云。</p>

<h3>五棓子來貨稀少</h3>
<p>我國出品物品之五棓子，爲染料申重要原料之一，除湖南與皖浙邊區兩產地年產各約數百担外，大部均爲川省，其中以桷西棓所含丹寗酸成份和淡，而肚棓頗爲強烈，各有其化學特性，如昔年南京貢緞之聞名，即係採用肚棓滲入顏料中，能使緞面之光彩，永久不變，近川省來貨稀少，其原因爲運輸時間緩慢，每一船隻由渝來滬，需時月餘，商人無利可圖故到滬稀少。</p>

<p>主席是白金斯老小姐，她首先介紹羅斯福夫人。羅夫人的演講，素來是亦莊亦諧，她的重濁而平穩的聲音，比在聯合國會議上講的，還要輕鬆有趣。她說：選舉是人民的自由，我不能强制你們選誰，不過，我願意推薦你們：米德，和李曼，接着她爲米德，李曼，大爲吹噓一番。吹噓得不過火，也不肉麻。她不講「共和黨」，她總是說「對方的黨」，她挖苦共和黨、無微不至。再次她提到「對方的黨」，台下便鬨堂大笑起來。</p>
<h3>羅斯福夫人在講壇上　她說：不是要統治男子　而是要與男子平等合作</h3>
<p>在婦女大會上，羅期福夫人沒有講外交問題，或世界大勢，爲適合婦女聽衆的口胃，她的演講非常弄得通俗。至少，在我所聽到的羅斯福夫人的演講中，是最最通俗的一次。她說：民主黨道兩位候選人，如果當選，一定會爲紐約州的諸姑姐妹謀幸福。她說：我們婦女對美國政治的要求是：「Of　The　Women　byThe　Women，For　The　Women」（我不知道該如何譯法），「但是」，她又接着說：「我們並不要求統治男人，而是與男人平等合作」。臺下鬨堂的大笑起來。</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人在講詞中，有一次提到她丈夫，羣衆狂熱的歡呼起來。美國人民的懷念故羅斯福總統，是美國歷史上罕有的現象。　講到婦女們怎樣去登記選舉，羅斯福夫人忽然「老氣橫秋」起來，她說：我老了，這些手續也鬧不淸了，「讓我介紹給你們，我們民主黨內年靑的一代婦女同志，諾頓太太」！說完，她便坐下了。</p>
<p>其實，諾頓太太也是白髮瀟瀟的了。她是紐約州的女參議員，民主黨在紐約州活動的中堅份子，她帶一頂「洋鼓軍帽」，有幾分「怪樣」。</p>
<h3>李曼太太　替她丈夫捧塲</h3>
<p>然後，羅期福夫人又介紹李曼夫人演講。她介紹說：「這位是我們前任紐約州州長夫人，現在是紐約州上議員候選者的夫人」。李曼太太風度很瀟洒，但在一個陌生的大塲面中，難免有點「怯塲」。她念了四頁預備好的演講稿于，內容是希望大家快去登記，不要放棄選舉的權利，而且希望大家選舉她的丈夫，當選紐的州出席上院的議員。她的替丈夫捧塲，並不令人起反感，用字和語氣，都非常歉和而誠懇。</p>
<h3>登記合格　才有選舉權利</h3>
<p>一個賢慧而幹練的夫人，是民主國家從政的人所必備的條件。</p>
<p>以後是一位男賓演講，他是民主黨派來替婦女火會捧塲的，很曾講話。他講了許多幽默輕鬆的「男女之間」的笑料，鼓起聽衆的興趣。然後，又勸大家幹快去作選民登記。在紐約，人口的流動性最大，紐約沒有像中國的保甲制度，因此，誰有選舉權，誰沒有選舉權，很成問題。所以，「登記」是很重要的一個步驟，登記合格，才有選舉權。選舉日期是十一月五日，登記的日期，是十月七日至十二日。在美國這樣的一個國家，他們的興趣在賺錢，賺錢以後的聲色娛樂，以及尋求更好的生活和享受。一般美國老百姓，對政治毫無興趣。因此，放棄登記的人數，非常衆多。他們的競選運動，爲自己吹噓，尙在其次，首先要促使人民踴躍登記，登記了，才談得到選舉及其他。</p>
<h3>生活第一　老翁不滿現實</h3>
<p>我沒有聽完全部節目，便離開了會塲。一個五十多歲的老頭子，打着呵欠，和我一起走。他說；羅斯福夫人很够人望。我問他是不是將選攀民主黨？他笑笑說：「卅年以前，美國有的是猪肉牛肉和火腿，猪肉每磅一角八分，火腿二角四分」。他說，卅年以前，他在紐約結婚，「那時候，生活纔舒服哪」！我問他：「現在呢」？</p>
<p>他把兩手一比：「什麼都買不到了」！</p>
<p>「那麼，你的意思，是要選舉共和黨了」？</p>
<p>「我自己也不知道」！</p>
<p>我看出他內心對現局的不滿。生活，生活，一切都是生活第一！歸途，我在電車站買了一份「每日鏡報」，上面畫着一幅漫畫，大街上許多商店的玻璃窗上，貼着：「沒有肉，糖，牛奶」之類的招貼。街的盡頭一家貼着：「選舉登記處，歡迎登記」。</p>
<p>這是一個非常非常現實的問題。民主黨的經濟政策，曾經對世界有過貢獻，但是，時至今日，美國的嚴重的經濟失調情形，無論如何，是不容否認的。</p>
<h3>樹立一個新規範　整肅浙省官常</h3>
<p>— 十六日杭州訊　本報特派員裕生</p>
<p>中國有一句老話：「升官發財」即是一個人如果做了官，錢財便會滾滾而來。所以岳飛將軍曾有。「文官不愛錢，武官不怕死」的警句。爲什麼「升官」以後，就可「發財」呢？以往的看法，官是民之父母，庶子須孝敬父母，一個地方就等於是一個家。官就是家長，錢財他可以隨便使用。民國以來，把「官」改爲「公樸」，實際上，「官」還是「官」，老百姓依然不得不孝敬。　抗戰時期，「官」們的作風仍未改變，與過去相較，不過變換了一個形式。抗戰後，「官」們的薪津少，不够維持生活，於是「意外的收入」與「額外取求」成了常有的現象。</p>
<p>有人說：「天下老鴉一般黑」，一向被譽爲政治尙稱修明的浙江也不能例外。縣長上任，一番歡迎，吃一個不了。縣長卸任，一番歡送，吃一個不了。縣長在任，要討好地方賣人「情」，地方紳土要講人「情」，只有「情」而無法。縣長大可在「情」裏生財有道。至於縣級以下的公務人員，尤其威風凜凜，許多人只好敢怒不敢言。</p>
<p>浙江省的縣長更易，至本年九月底止，共計發生三百八十五任，但結淸者不到三分之一，爲一百二十一任，其餘都懸而未結。這未結的二百六十四任中，除四十八任將可結束及二十六屆任未規定限期者外，分析言之，可分爲五類：（一）爲未經後任盤査者，計四十四任。（二）爲已着手盤査者計四十七任。（三）爲檔案損失，朱辦淸移交者，計三十四任。（四）爲交代手續未臻完備者，計五十五任。（五）爲盤竣未報者，計十任。根據這個統計，我們慨然於縣長交代時的未能淸結，這其間，不免使人有懷疑的感覺。其中尤以四四任的縣長，後任未經調査，値得我們注意。</p>
<p>全月薪水　只够抽香烟用</p>
<p>我曾碰見很多縣長和縣級公務人員，他們都說做縣級公務人員的不易。五個月前，縣長每月僅能拿到五萬元至八萬元，科長三萬元至四萬元，縣長假定每天抽香烟一包價九百元，則一個月就要二萬七千元，再加招待客人抽抽香烟，豈不就要五萬多元？則一位科長的薪水不能抽香烟，縣長全個月的薪水，僅能抽香烟。然而縣長的一家大小要靠他養活，縱令勤工之類，可以由縣府來用，房屋可以住在縣府內，但每天的伙食費總要開支。不時上峯來的人，一定要招待招待，喝喝酒，品品茶，在在都需要錢，縣長的錢從那裏來呢？所以浙省×區專員在行政會議上：「公務員待遇菲薄的結果，造成無官不貪的現象」。</p>
<p>取締苛雜　怎麼還要攤派</p>
<p>是的，浙江省很多縣官，人民不堪其擾，弄得民不聊生，什麼復興捐，建設捐等等，捐一個不了，捐的錢那裏去了？地方復興了沒有？建設了沒有？我也曾碰到很多地方的公正人士，他們對縣官的表示，一則同情縣官們的淸苦，一則痛恨縣官們的苛擾。現在浙江省政府雖然決定取締一切苛捐雜稅，但是有些縣份，還在藉口舉辦敎育，興修水利，來向人民攤募。我們並非反對興辦敎育與水利，而是要人民自當的感着敎育水利之必須興辦，由人民來勸募，這才是有意義的。但是有些縣份的負資人說：「浙省府的禁止攤派，取締苛捐雜說，僅是一紙令文而已。縣政經費困難，不攤派是做不通的」。</p>
<p>仗衙門勢　官商公私不分</p>
<p>物價像一隻吃人的老虎，不斷的在跳。縣級公務人員比較有點辦法的，自然也集一些錢，做一點投機買賣，或是放一點高利貸，他們靠着衙門的勢，當然比較其他的商人來得順利。如此結果，物價更向上跳。這區區的薪津，自然不値得一顧，而公事上的衙門，倒是進行自己業務很好的靠山。這樣，官商不分，公私不分，情法不分，混亂·糊塗·一團槽。</p>
<p>貪吃的貓　習慣不易打破</p>
<p>兩個月前，浙江區的公務員調整，底薪六萬元，加成數三百倍，縣長待遇，薦任六級至一級的，由十五萬元至十八萬元。科長委任六級至一級的，由九萬六千元至十二萬元。比較三四萬元七八萬元時，自然好一些了，但是一隻貪吃偸食的貓，牠已經成了貪吃偸食的習慣，不易立刻改善牠的行爲。兼營商業者依然如故，從中想法額外取求的，亦依然如故，於是物價更高漲，生活更不易維持。最近，待遇又調整了，底薪九萬元，加成數五百四十倍，縣長待遇，由二十萬元至三十萬元，科長待遇，由十五萬元至二十萬元。如果能够省吃儉用，眞正做到「先天下人之憂而憂」，倒也可以維持了，只是一切習慣和一切陋規，仍要看我們能否立下決心，斷然取締？</p>
<p>看到壞官　便忽略了好官</p>
<p>現在，一般老百姓的看法，認做官的人，一定貪汚，一定撈錢，而做官的人的看法，薪津跟不上物價，不有一些額外的取求，又有什麽辦法？話得說回來，其實完全沒有額外取求，眞正的度着艱苦生活，孜孜的辦公事的公務員也大有人在，只是被一些敗壞風氣的人佔了先，一般人只看到壞的，忽略了好的了。我曾經這樣想：如果全體公務員個個不貪汚，不經商，生活淸苦，則物價不會如此漲，說不定公務員的生活待遇老早調整好了。可惜那守不住的人，才弄壞了公務員的名譽。</p>
<p>熱望改革　勿走官塲舊徑</p>
<p>記者極懇切地熱望着浙江雀政府能痛下決心，從事刷新一番，除了嚴禁攤派，取締苛捐雜稅之外，還需要有嚴禁公務人員兼營商業的命令。關於嚴禁公務人員兼營商業，應該獎勵人民吿發，否則半官半商，官商不分，官衙亦變了商店，商店類似衙門，只苦了窮困的老百姓，在高度的物價下喘息。</p>
<p>其次，還要嚴禁公務人員舖張酬應，規定節的待客的辦法。獎勵廉潔的官吏，也實在是整肅官常之道。還有最重要的一件事，就是人事制度的必須健全，否則縣官存五日京兆之心，蒞任之始，就恐即要交卸，自然，在任時儘想撈他一筆了。</p>
<p>浙江省本爲政治尙稱修明之省，這幾年來，修明到如何程度，實在不敢說，我們希望做官的人一定要存一個好心，決意做一個好官，上峯也要多爲好官着想，樹立一個新的健全的規範。</p>

<p>江西巡迴醫療隊出發疫區工作　（特約記者劉藻攝）</p>
<h3>贛東「黑色警報」！　建起圍剿鼠疫的頑强壁壘　秋末冬初流行期前澈底完成防治工作</h3>
<p>— 十九日南昌訊　本報特約記者劉藻</p>
<p>戰爭帶給江西人民以無比的災害，牠更傳播了各種可怕的疫病。在福建蟄伏了近四十年的鼠疫，也在戰爭期間復活起來了。當殘暴的敵軍進入閩境的時候，沿海居民，紛紛遷來江西，噬人的「黑死病」便從此傳了過來。牠的傳導路綫，最初是由福建的南平，都武，傳到光澤，另一路是由蒲城傳到廣豐，在防疫設備間陋的情况下，牠便年甚一年的延展到南城，南豐，黎川，臨川，廣昌，上饒，金谿等縣，直到現在，黑色的恐怖，幾已籠罩着贛省的大半邊。疫區的擴大，死亡人數的衆多，以及擴展的迅速，眞是使人心悸。</p>
<p>閩贛接壤地帶　死鼠發現</p>
<p>鼠疫在江西的歷史，最先是民國三十年三月裏，鄰近福建的光澤順化坊地方，因爲閩贛運轍頻繁，在一家米店裏，發現了幾頭死鼠，當時沒有人注意，後來續有死鼠發現，且有鼠疫病患者發生，才疑心是鼠疫，所以最初發生日期及病人若干，並無記載，旋因傳染益廣，地方當局即電知省衛生處調遣防疫人員前往防治，至六月十七日止，醫治三十四人中，死了二十八人，治愈五人，逃一人，死亡率之高，實是驚人！</p>
<p>鼠疫的大本營　南城吿急</p>
<p>殺人千萬的鼠疫病菌，接着就傳到了南城，時間是三十三年六月，疫勢一開始，就很兇猛，那時正是浙贛戰役以後，南城被敵蹂躪，人心惶惶，那能顧及此事？星星之火，由是燎原！</p>
<p>南城的鼠疫擴展開來，從城內到鄕村，向着硝石，世厚，珀玕，株良，新豐，袱牛等鄕，作扇形的伸展，據醫療機關統計，共發現病人六七五人，死亡三六二人，未經診治隱匿或不知報吿的死亡人數，還不在內。因此，南城便成了江西鼠疫的「大本營。」</p>
<p>空氣傳染作用　疫區擴展</p>
<p>經過了一個間歇時期，到三十四年十月，南城疫勢更加猖獗，疫區擴展到六七十里以外，發現最厲害的「肺鼠疫」和「腦膜炎鼠疫」病例，據醫學專家談，這兩種鼠疫菌，可藉空氣傳染，蔓延的速度和死亡率的高度，遠在普通鼠疫幾倍以上。</p>
<p>患者遍體發黑　兩天傷命</p>
<p>南城的鄰縣南豐，接着也被彼及，在該縣城外柳樹下的一家住戶中，初見死鼠二頭，旋有親戚帶來的二個小孩，其中一個突然患病，二天之內不治身死，繼之另一個孩子又病，也是兩大傷命，症狀都是遍身發黑，流淚有涕無嗽。不久，又有婦人袁陳氏，亦突發高熱頭痛，眼膜充血，面色靑黑，晚間即吿死亡。從此，疫勢蔓延到李家排，岳廟，等處，距城三十里的傳坊，也有病例發生。據統計：該地患者死亡率超過百分之六十。</p>
<p>當鼠疫跨進南城之際，同時又竄入黎川縣境，三十四年十一月有一婦人鄧氏，在南城之硝石鄉弔喪回家，隨即患病身死。其後，城內便不斷的發生了鼠疫病人，死亡相繼。</p>
<p>醫師解剖死鼠之情形　（特約記者劉藻攝）</p>
<p>一旦侵入潯南　全省受脅</p>
<p>由於南城「鼠疫大本營」的形成，疫癘的魔掌，籠罩着整個贛東。廣昌，金谿，臨川，上饒，等縣，都先後發出「黑色警報」。</p>
<p>臨川距南昌，九江兩地，祗是一目的旅程，該地爲贛東糧食集散地，交通頻繁，如果臨川疫勢復熾，潯南可能成爲鼠疫病菌侵擾的指標，江西全省人民的生命受着重大威脅。</p>
<p>江西鼠疫侵擾地區，患者最多的要算南城，其次是光澤。據初步調査統計；（最低數字），南城鼠疫患者共六七五人，死三七二人，光澤患者五二五人，死亡一八二人，本年一月，南豐患鼠疫者九三人，死亡五一人，黎川患者九三人，死卅九人，臨川患者五七人，死亡十六人。</p>
<p>南城臨川兩地　設防疫處</p>
<p>鼠疫醫療防治的工作怎樣呢？贛省衛生處鑒於鼠疫之侵襲，當即調派防疫隊前往各疫區醫療和防治，並在南城設立防疫處，在這幾年中，雖未完全把鼠疫撲滅，但也確有相當功效。</p>
<p>除駐在臨川者有省防疫總隊一。九中隊，駐南城三中隊，駐南豐五中隊，駐黎川衛生技術人員數人外，並在各該縣設有防疫處及隔離病院，治療已患病人。</p>
<p>防鼠疫三步驟　加緊進行</p>
<p>面對着這威脅人民生命的疫癘，行總贛分署決定作有計劃的防治，本年五月間，派該署所組設的巡廻醫療防疫第一隊，會同衛生處人員，開始在贛東大刀闊斧的進行剿滅工作」。</p>
<p>首先，該隊對疫區中的人民，來一個普遍的預防注射，當時在南城注射六六五九人，廣昌注射一五一五人。金谿注射五〇〇人，並在臨川。南豐等縣鄕間挨戶注射。</p>
<p>第二步，即在各地展開滅蚤剿鼠的工作，在南城塡塞鼠穴九五二一個，薰蒸鼠穴六一五五個，灑滅蚤藥劑一六九七間，收集鼠一八一九顯，並在臨川·廣昌·金谿等縣展開同樣工作。</p>
<p>第三步，即同時在疫區成立鼠疫隔離病院，派遣醫藥技術人員，運往大批藥械，從事醫療。</p>
<p>認有治本必要　專家努力</p>
<p>經過緊急措施之後，醫藥專家們認爲還有進一步「治本」的必要，於是又在各地建築起圍剿鼠疫的壁壘，其辦法：（一）組設各縣防疫委員會，由專員，縣長任主委，省立醫院院長任副主委，負責主持防疫事宜。（二）展開防疫宣傳。（三）硏究消滅病原方法。（四）充實隔離病院。（五）加强鼠疫情報。（六）管理疫區，凡發生鼠疫之村莊，應特別管理，不准行人來往，以包圍方式阻止其傳播。</p>
<p>提高知識水準　有裨滅鼠</p>
<p>目前江西撲滅鼠疫，最感困難的問題，是民衆知識水準太低，對於鼠疫傳染的危險性，懵然無知，往往隱匿不報，甚至逃避他方，唯恐被迫送院。至於保甲畏也是徇情不報，故患者眞實數目，亦無法統計。</p>
<p>地方紳士以及保甲長，大多懷守舊觀念，對於疫情，隱匿不報，疫區管理，不予協助，不知從事預防工作，改良環境衛生，祇知求神拜佛，打醮送船等迷信舉動，以至傳染日廣，難以收拾。</p>
<p>鼠疫流行期前　完成防治</p>
<p>醫院設備欠缺，藥械亦感不數，行總贛分署配發的藥品種類不多，而省縣衛生機關又皆屬經費困難，談不到藥材的購置。</p>
<p>現在聽說行總贛分署爲協助澈底撲滅，贛東鼠疫，已核准撥給大批藥品曁國幣二千五百萬元，交由贛東鼠疫防治處應用，並由該分署派專門委員劉南偕同聯總駐贛辦事處醫生桑德生，衛生署鼠疫防治專家伯力士，赴臨川南城一帶視察，並在南城召開鼠疫防治座談會，決定將贛東鼠疫防治總處設於南城，另在臨川·黎川·兩縣，各設分處，準備在今年秋末冬初鼠疫流行期前完成防治撲滅工作。</p>
<h3>合肥小時景</h3>
<p>— 十二日訊　竇白萍</p>
<p>合肥古蹟很多，記者以時間忽促，只到明敎寺·逍遙津·包公河·三處，走馬看花地頑了一趟。此間被敵人盤據八個年頭，城內許多地方都己改變，這三處自然也非舊觀了。</p>
<p>明敎寺在東門大街，夾在居民住宅的中間，但寺的地位突高，踏上十多個石級才進大門，向右方走有一個小亭，相傳這是魏曹操點將的舊址，名爲點將台。其實是否屬實，記者不敢向讀者作肯定的報道，因爲除了有這座高土台而外，看不出有曹操其他遣跡，在正史上又未見記載，只是合肥在三國時屬於魏國那是眞的，而曹操當年是否眞在此處點將，誰也不能確定的了。</p>
<p>逍遙津，由三國時張遼之威鎭而出名，據說本來在合肥城外，明代合肥城改建擴大，逍遙津被圍入在城內東北角，現在只是一塊廣大的草地，徒供遊覽憑弔而已。</p>
<p>出南薰門向左走，不過數十步便到包公祠，祠在水中央，有包孝肅公石像，在敵人佔領時祠屋損壞頗多，祠旁有包公幼時讀書處的紀念亭，在祠的對而爲包家村，是包公後裔，看去盡是破落戶，最近省府撥款一千萬元重修包祠，想不久的將來定又是一番氣象。</p>
<h3>巴黎兩盛會</h3>
<p>— 十日巴黎航訊　往仁</p>
<p>年來海外華人之地位，與日俱增，因風直上，法蘭西之於吾華，言政治爲民主先進國，言國民性，則同爲南大陸之富理想而傾向自由，平時氣誼相投，遇事守望相助。而我華駐法錢大使泰，以法律專家任外交重寄，上屆一九一九年第一屆巴黎和會，已代表司法部出任專門委員，本年七月至十月延續進行之第二和會復共郭前外長，傅大使，分任中華民國駐會正代表，本年卅五度之雙十國慶，適在和會未終席之先舉行，以是巴黎第八區祝治五世蔭道（Avenue　George　V）十一號大使館門外馬龍車水之雄觀，幾爲設使置館以來所罕遇。</p>

<p>迨使館之慶典，方吿完成，而巴黎第五區法京最高學府北樓下廣逾大戲園之『半圓堂Hemicycle』歡祝國慶紀念大會，又即於錢火使領導下，依照程序，開始舉行。</p>

<h3>光復後之台灣</h3>
<p>— 陳訓悆攝</p>
<p>台灣一名omosa，荷蘭語之意爲「美麗的寶島」，故風景幽美，四季常春。該島昔代本爲中國領土，歐人東移後，西班牙葡萄牙荷蘭人相繼移殖該島，與漢人混居一處。元代設置巡檢司，割澎湖列島及台灣入中國版圖。明初洪武二十年歷巡檢司，倂爲中國本土之一部。嘉靖年間成海盜曾一本林鳳等根據地，迄崇禎八年，鄭芝龍據台反抗滿清，其子鄭成功亦不甘爲虜作奴，出師勤王，附侍唐王，被封爲忠孝伯，後北征失敗，牽兵二萬五千人退台，在高雄登陸血戰荷兵，荷人不支請降，重成華夏藩蜀，同治十年琉球人徙台被殺，日人與清廷交涉，其後中日交戰，簽訂馬關條約，將台灣正式割讓日本。時正同治十三年西曆一八九四年也。迨開羅會議閉幕，四強領袖共同決定台灣原係中國領土應仍歸還我國。日本無條件投降後，三十四年十月二十五日，我國政府派陳儀赴台受降，山河重光，台灣重入中國版圖。總計日人統治台灣，先後達五十二年。台灣人民因受日人奴化敎育，思想文字均已受毒甚深，今後再敎育問題，實屬不容忽視。台民爲首先反抗滿清之根據地，人民富於民族觀念，故對鄭成功抗清偽業，立祠年祭，至今不衰。此次中國新聞界組織台灣視察團於前，蔣主席宋院長又於收復一週年時巡視於後，足見我國朝野對於台灣之重視；而台灣同胞今已重見天日，故對中國統一台灣光復，亦寄以無上之熱誠與企望焉。本輯所刊台圖，係本報總經理陳訓悆赴台時所攝，足以窺見台灣之一斑。</p>

<p>每天在一定的時間他便會到一定的地點來，躑躅許久，壯起胆量左右張望，似乎在找尋什麼人，而且還凝視着行人樹木和牆壁。他的一件灰色的外套已經變成綠色了。在他那削瘦的肩膀上垂下來。從射到他身上的燈光裏，可以見到腫起的黃頰上稀疎的幾根鬍鬚，從燈光裏看他的前額，連一絲的血色都沒有。若是在氣假晴朗的傍晚，這孱弱的人這樣子胆怯的擱淺在羣衆行路的便道上的邊沿，那就一個觸礁的船，而對着整個宇宙發生了疑問，但在某一時刻裏，有人見到他忽然挺直了身子，在臉上已露出光明的期望來。</p>
<p>有一個女人活活潑潑的向他走來了。像一朶玫瑰似的停在他的鼻子下，給他看看雪潔的牙齒，也搖着她圍在毛領子中的頸項，歌唱着甜蜜的曲子表示出對於他的歡迎。在他那方面，已開始現出笑容來，而且是連續的狂笑，他使他的身子平衡着，可是震顫得很厲害，那樣子就如一個沉溺在水裏的人，爲人拉出放得端正的樣子，她是個絕色美麗的女人，離然衣飾破舊不堪。但是，他的美麗和衣服的破舊，正在極相反的地位，她像是化了裝，有如戲台上的女神，她的眼珠和嘴唇會呌人疑心是彫刻的。</p>
<p>這人來到這裏的願望，因了他的狂喜恢復過來，他一起始談話，有幾個話音到唇邊就止住了，他挽住女人的手，一個小巧，一個瘦削，便一同走開了去，倆個人全是那樣子瘦弱，遠遠望過去，可以說他們是由於一個人分成的兩個人。</p>
<p>在那邊，新開這裏有一百步的地方，在羣衆肩摩踵接中，每天晚上有一個年靑婦人，也站在那邊等待着人。</p>
<p>她常見來得很早，起始遇不到誰，她便到賣新聞紙的亭子傍邊慢慢地拖着步子。</p>
<p>她是穿着一件粗糙的灰色的衣服，籠罩着無限的憂鬱，在帽子上那一條藍色絲帶是他的唯一裝飾品，從奔馳的運貨車的閃光裏，便會映出她那一副不規則的蒼老面孔，眼睛門下，鼻子突起而長，張着一隻寬大的嘴，有時候她在打呵欠，挺長的牙齒，便會閃露在嘴唇外邊顯出猙獰的樣子，深黑的眼睛不住閃動，神氣是異常的疲倦，但，過不久，便會又變得很驚覺了，像是醒過來似的。她爲的是要振作精神，異樣的拖着快的脚步，擺動她緊握傘把的右手和提着傘把的左手。接着她又改了樣了，她的眼睛像電光似的發亮，嘴唇動着，在低聲談話，和許多人祁禱的態度一樣。</p>
<p>這原因是那邊有一個人數面身優閒的向她這方來，他是個豪氣的人，冤肩紅頰，有着濃厚的的鬍鬚。</p>
<p>他走近了，向她點頭，她起始不動一動，像是一個昏迷了的鳥，她的手也在像鳥翅的尖端似的顫抖起來，他不開口，她也就不能說話。後來決定伸出手來謹愼的攪住了他的手臂，他强壯而且有無限的魔力，倆人便走開了。她用全力緊靠着他，但她軟弱無力，眞如一個老祖母那種樣子，他却　然地走着，未把她放在心上。</p>
<p>這兩個會合，差不多在每晚上，我在隣近的地方看到，當這兩對配合完好之後，便沒入人　中走了。</p>
<p>因爲我生性是尋根究底的，所以我常從衣穿着灰色外套的男人和有藍色絲帶的婦人的臉上—起初疲倦，入後狂喜—繼續着讀這兩個愛情的故事。</p>
<p>他們倆都找到伴侶，使生活發生趣味，全獲得美麗的人作爲他們的化身。雖然他倆猙獰醜陋竟然在許多男女中找到比他們更有價値的伴侶，而且是全然成功了。</p>
<p>但我常說，這兩首情詩不會有個終結，他們過於脆弱了，因爲每對中全有一個是不健全，這方面對那方面有着過大的要求，他們的貧乏和供應就大得使他們不能支持下去了。</p>
<p>這只是偶然的暫時情形，那命運使這愁苦的女工獲到了美鬚男子，却使如花的女人配個幾乎遭她蔑視的不幸的男人。</p>
<p>這毫無疑慮，這個文雅的紳士不過爲一時便利和利益，受一個熱切而順從的心的崇敬，他正有許多世界上的美麗女人等着他呢，這年靑淨潔的女人呢，初次尋求愛情，過於　動，將來她要拋棄那每晚在街角向她懇求的人另選好主。</p>
<p>這些，是我集合了諸種正確的觀察之後，而使我在內心中發出來的想念。</p>
<p>啊！我猜得一些不錯，事情結果很惡劣—像在日常生活中所遇到的一樣，事事全向失意這方面襲來，又有如不高明的小說，呌人從頭到尾猜個完全。結果呢，牠不久便來了。有一天，當我離開鎭上不幾天之後，我照樣在路傍散步，但比平時晚些，這穿灰色外套的人正在獨自等着。在另外一處地方，那頭上有藍色絲帶的婦人也正獨自留在那里。</p>
<p>次日，我依然見到路上站着這兩個孤獨的人，他的眼睛張望擁擠的人羣，在找尋她，可是她終未到來，在爲生活奔忙的過路人羣中，他穿着發亮的外套肩膀下垂着，像一個死人，也像一個罪犯，臉上佈滿了一層灰色。</p>
<p>她的眼光不再平觀，全然失望的看在地下，而在注視着那流動的溝水—一條窄狹的泥河像大河混濁，但是大得不够溺死一個人，我退後幾步，看見她沒有表情的殘缺不全的側面的臉孔，她的胸膛像石板一樣的平，她的寬嘴瘦而不端。</p>
<p>我不知覺的站在這兩個受着明傷的不相識者中間了。</p>
<p>我不知怎樣把這件守侯的事擱起，也不知怎樣再去守候，他們各自離開了平日約會的地方。她向亭子背後退下幾步，隨即轉身走下街去。他在退　路旁之後，也不由自主的走上前去。我可很驚奇，命運好像要把這兩個半對情人拉到同一的地點，在這荒凉的黑石道上，他們註定該相會，誰能說這兩個愁苦的人具有血心在相互認識之後，不會得到援助呢？誰能說這兩個留得殘生的人，不會代替了那兩個不見了的人，那兩們美麗的和他們不相稱的人呢？他們確乎走到近前了，他們抬起頭來，他們相互望着，他們又立刻回過頭去。</p>
<p>唉！他們實際上已經認識了，他們同時也認識了他們可憐的無法饒恕的醜陋，他們的醜陋的罪過，我將永遠忘不了這相互的一望，因爲其中充滿了懷恨和可怕的詛咒在着啊！</p>
<h3>朱熹與朱淑貞之關係</h3>
<p>— 羊仁</p>
<p>這本刋孫約翰先生「歐陽修與朱淑貞之生查子案」一文後，對於「人約黃昏後」一詞之確爲朱淑貞所作，當無疑義，惟「朱淑貞是朱燾的姪女」一說，孫先生以「朱淑貞是浙江海寗人，而朱熹是新安人，譜中並無兄弟遷居海寗者，」故認爲「有些不確」，這問題，在我們海寗人看來，比較更感興趣，不揣謭陋，願以淺見所及，來談談朱熹與朱淑貞的關係，我們先來引述一些零星記載：</p>
<p>海寗縣志藝文志閨秀類：「朱淑貞，徽國文公姪女……」</p>
<p>斷腸集序：「淑貞……夫臨安王唐佐……」按臨安即今之杭縣。</p>
<p>辭源：朱熹，宋婺源人（即新安），……僑寓建州……歷高孝光寗四朝，累官……卒贈寶謨閣學土，諡曰文，紹定時追封徽國公…」</p>
<p>從這些零屋記載的表面上看，以一個海寗的朱淑貞，怎會是原籍安徽後遷福建的朱熹之姪女呢？但是我們只要把這幾點聯繫起來，觀測一下，就可以見得朱淑貞是朱熹的姪女，並不希奇，而且還是非常確實。</p>
<p>因爲現在的杭縣，是南宋建都的地方；而朱熹是南宋的大官，（現在杭州西湖旁邊有朱文公祠）並且是「歷高孝光寗四朝」累任要職的老臣；那末他雖然是原籍安徽，後遷福建的人，但因爲「出仕」關係，携眷久住杭縣，也是當然的事；以久住杭縣之故，他有位姪女嫁給杭縣人王唐佐爲妻，在事實上，非但可能，而且覺得很自然。後來王氏遷居海寗，朱淑貞嫁夫隨夫，當然就同了過來；不過朱淑貞以詩詞出了名，縣志上取的是「藝文」，所以只有朱淑貞的名字，而沒有她夫家的記述了，然則朱淑貞之爲朱熹的姪女，未可以爲朱氏「譜中並無兄弟遷居海寗者」之故，遂即認爲不確，於情於理，昭昭明甚矣。</p>
<p>我們還可以從其他如環境，舉動等方面，來做朱淑貞是朱熹姪女的旁證：</p>
<p>以朱淑貞一女子而文學造詣如是之深，當非一般平民階級所能成就，雖然她天姿秀發，但若非生長在一代理學大家的書禮門庭，得到　育薰陶，淵源有素，恐怕還是辦不到吧。</p>
<p>朱淑貞死後，她的父母把她詩詞遺作，付之一炬；這是一個値得注意的異乎常情的舉動：以「天下父母心」來說，當親生女兒死後，沒有一個不是格外愛惜她的遺物的；但朱淑貞的父母却反是，這顯然因爲他們是「仕宦名門」，而她的遣作裏，很有許多「蕩檢」的地方，這豈不要沾辱了「家聲」！所以在盛怒之下也就不顧骨肉之情，而把它毀滅了。</p>
<p>依這種種形迹上來看，說朱淑貞是朱熹的姪女，並無不類，而且也很脗合。</p>
<h3>塞上小夜曲</h3>
<p>— 葉風</p>
<p>寂寞的夜</p>
<p>太陽剛落下去，昏暗而荒凉的夜便購着脚走過來。草原上呈現得很沉寂：沒有風，天上沒有星星。野草入睡了，村莊抖慄在寒冷裏入睡了……一切都彷彿跌進靜謐的幽谷了，做着幽鬱的夢。</p>
<p>今夜，草原上呈現得很沉寂，此刻已沒有人坐在河岸上唱歌了。多情的小河陷入更深的寂寞裏了。</p>
<p>今夜，草原上爲什磨會變得如此沉寂？沉寂得有些令人害怕。那些草原上的吉卜賽歌人今夜到什麼地方去演奏了呢？爲什麼不給我們留下一張豎琴和一隻手風琴，讓我們也來彈奏彈奏！</p>
<p>夜很寂寞，我們底激動的心是如何渴望去彈唱一支歌！</p>
<p>歌</p>
<p>你喜歡歌嗎？那末就讓我們來彈奏一支「草原交嚮曲」給你聽吧！我們草原上的人民每個人幾乎是個吹打手，在我們底帳篷外面每夜都有一個音樂演奏會。在嚴寒的夜里我們生起一堆熊熊的篝火，我們衆多的人開坐在一起吹着，唱着……我們底歌是雄渾而響亮的。</p>
<p>看人民底歌手都一個個從帳篷裏走出來，帶着他們心愛的琴弦來參加我們這個愉快的演奏會了。</p>
<p>今夜，草原上爲什麼顯得如此沉寂呢！篝火熄滅了，只有一個童顏皓髮的老人坐在草堆上給孩子們講故事。你去問他吧！那老人會這樣告訴你：我們底歌手今夜到一個遙遠的地方去參加一個盛大的演奏會了。</p>
<p>夜話</p>
<p>已經是將近午夜的時候了，可是我們底歌手還沒有回來，他們是不是又去拜訪科爾沁旗草原底王國了。夜多寒冷啊！你還是同我們一道回到帳篷裏去吧！不要再坐在草堆上痴想了。</p>
<p>回到帳篷裏來吧！我們已爲你生起一堆火，讓我們來談個通宵也好，帳篷裏很溫暖，那老人還預備給你講故事，講些原上陳遠的故事；</p>
<p>太陽是怎樣從草原上升起來，星星是怎樣在遼闊的夜空放出光輝，風砂是怎樣鞭打着草原上的人民，而那些人民又是怎樣艱苦的生活在冰雪裏。……</p>
<p>遙遠的想念</p>
<p>你睡在我們底草舖上感到舖適嗎？在你們生長木棉花溫煦的南方底土地土還有誰拿草來舖在牀上睡眠呢！</p>
<p>今夜，我看到你躺在草舖上睜大一雙光閃閃的眼睛向帳篷外漆黑的天空探望。是午夜的時候了，我看到你還輾轉不能成寐，而夜又如此靜，靜使你陷入了寂寞的池沼，我知道你有些想念自己底故鄕了。你站起來走到外面去，望望南方的天空，低下頭悵然地沉思了許久才又重踱回來，於是你底苦瀝的眼睛便有了品塋的淚光。……</p>

<h3>新刊闌姆書簡集</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>卡斯（E.V.Lucas）費了三十年堅苦的搜集工夫，曾在一九三五年出版過三卷本的「　姆（Charles　Lamb）書簡集」，一共搜集了一千零二十一封信。大部分的原信都在美國。英國博物館所藏，只是很寒傖的五十封信罷了。不過闌姆的作品裏關涉到美國文學和批評的地方却很少。他在一八三三年的一封信裏，曾經感謝一位通信的人替他從「美國反映」這刋物上抄出一篇文章。</p>
<p>一九〇九年「萬人叢書」本曾經選出　姆的書簡五百七十二封，現在該叢書又從盧卡斯本選了一些來，重行配置排列，新印了一種兩卷本，連闌姆的妹妹馬麗·闌姆的信在內。現已增至七百三十八封信，連盧卡斯有價値的註釋和索引在內。</p>
<p>在英國文學史中，誰也沒有闌姆這樣幸運，能保存這樣多的信。這些信足够解釋他的生活和態度。他比考貝（Cowper）還要幸運，比任何書簡作家都要幸運。</p>
<p>闌姆的信裏常談到辜律勒己（Colcridge）。是辜律勒己「使得他達到較好的境地，拯救他脫離那齷齪世界」的。（盧卡斯書簡第三十二）闌姆在一八三四年寫道：「沒有他，我簡直不能思索，簡直不能批評人與書籍。他是我一切思索的試金石。」</p>
<p>闌姆有三十七封信是寫給華茲華斯的。其中有一兩封寫得頗爲精緻。較早的信中，提及收到華茲華斯所贈的第二版「抒情詩集」，並曾比較倫敦和鄕間的生活。</p>
<p>華茲華斯不及辜律勒己會寫信。後者雖存信僅六百五十封，却頗多魅力。前者雖存有一千七百封，可讀者却極少。騷西（Southey）極擅於書簡，闌姆曾給他二十三封信，約在一七九八和一七九九這兩年。其中有一信曾向他代一個「可憐人」求東印度公司的額外書記。</p>
<p>闌姆的信沒有寫給濟慈·雪萊和拜倫的，我們也不知道他們三個人曾有信寫給闌姆過。濟慈的信中曾經兩次提到闌姆，都帶着輕硯。雪萊也提到過闌姆兩次，稱他有「最深沉的學問和最甜蜜的性格。」拜倫信中闌姆的名字只見過一次，也輕蔑地將他與三位湖畔詩人連帶涉及。</p>
<p>籣姆寫信給辜律勒己說：「像我這樣的懶人，寫信與接信都是非常喜歡的。不過我不願爲了常聽到你的話而佔去你的寶貴的時間。」</p>
<p>闌姆與馬寗（Thomas　Manning）的友誼頗深，從一七九九年通信起，直到一八〇六年馬寗與他分別到廣州去。闌姆別的朋友可以忘記，惟有馬寗應該記住，因爲他是闌姆「論烤猪」的合作者。</p>
<p>起初闌姆是詩人。一七九七年他的詩可以作辜律勒己的詩的註脚，他也以此爲滿足。他有一兩首詩常被選本選進去。一七九八年詩人一變而爲小說家。雪萊說：「他所寫的羅沙孟·格雷（Rosamund　Gray）是多末的可愛呵！」但現在有誰知道這一本可愛的書呢！」四年以後，闌姆自費印行了他的戲劇「約翰·吳德維」（John　Woodvil）。這本書寫得很美，而且有力。但愛丁堡評論殺害了它。一八〇六年他的喜劇「H先生」被噓出舞台。一八一八年他結集了這些失敗的作品編成兩卷本的全集，扉頁上寫明，那是獻給辜律勒己的。闌姆寫作詩歌小說和戲劇都沒有成就，但他終於以小品文和書簡奠定了文壇的地位。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　73</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>虎弟帶着他手下的人走後，我在偽公府我們專員所設臨時辦事處，俄延了幾分鐘又巡視了一回，便也辭了那位專員，帶人上車，趕到偽自治軍團總司令部去那裏本來爲「保安隊一大隊，聯合第十二團一連人，去處理繳械工作。汽車沿路走着，聽見城外槍聲十分緊密，知道這次反正的四大隊保安隊，和反正的第十二團弟兄，已在城外與日寇駐軍正在作戰。心下十分噪急，巴不得立時飛到城外，看個究竟。</p>
<p>到了偽自治軍司令部，碰見奉令去擔任繳械的一位保安隊大隊長，是我們寨子裏的人，告訴我說繳械工作，一點沒受抵抗，偽駐軍第七第十四兩個番號，共五營多人，願意立刻改編了，趕到城外參加作戰，不過要求先發一個月軍糧，因爲在這以前，他們實在被尅扣得幾乎餓死。我們所派的專員，那位協助繳械工作的負責人，已經答應了條件，現在已派人到三個駐軍營去淸點檢閱他們的槍械子彈和配備去了。</p>
<p>我聽了這大隊長的報告，又進司令部同專員談了幾句話，證實了大隊長的報告確實，才立刻草了一個報告，簽了名，呌一個快報員送到總部去。一方面又寫了一個條子，呌另外一位快報送去給虎弟，口頭又說明，假若那邊的事情順利，呌虎弟立回總部一次。</p>
<p>誰和我這裏的快報員剛走不到五分鐘，我正預備動身回部，虎弟那裏爲一個快報員，却岔息趕了來，面孔上堆着了十分緊張的神色，遞土來一張字條。</p>
<p>打開字條一看，倒是虎弟的手跡，上面歪歪倒倒寫着：「報告，今正查騐朔賊殷爾根，非爲眞死，乃是退生，只我能知眞情，朔賊之男女人等，說之十分不淸，說是十日九不在府，乃在雙籠斬賽中。雙龍斬寨之地，崔姐知之，我也得知。同志不願合作，　　心狠。我今秘密，亦不呌彼等知。千萬千萬。要緊要緊。隊長可快來崔姐之處，定可一面，十點之後，我一人去矣。巧裝之事，已經都行。……蕭虎城立正。」</p>
<p>這張字條，簡直寫成了特別密碼一樣，許多白字不算，句子也不通，除了我一人之外，恐怕撫人能看得明白。我反覆看了兩遍，方將幾個要點看明，一、大槪去逮捕殷逆的同志，誤認他人爲殷逆正身，將之擊斃，虎弟則認明並非逆賊正身。二、虎弟從殷逆家口中追出殷逆十有九日匿居雙龍塹·即翠姐母女所說的那個「魔窟」。三、同志們大槪有些忌尅虎弟所以他把雙龍塹的事，也隱下不說，要我也保守秘密。四、他約我同去探險，並已備下化裝衣物；十點以前，在翠姐處聚首。</p>
<p>因要明瞭虎弟在殷逆宅中的經過情形，我又盤問了那快報員幾句，才知道逆宅衛隊，雜有日人及高麗棒子甚多，抵抗十分厲害。還是虎弟帶着兩個手下，又找了十幾個相識的保安隊，從後院子翻牆，一面放火，從裏面打出來，前後夾攻，才將衛隊死士解決。據說圍抄逆宅，逮捕逆兇的負責專員，本定活捉逆首，沒料到逆首「殷汝根」也會射擊，並且射技很精，我方很有幾位同志，犧牲在他槍下。據快報員親眼看見，殷逆是被虎弟一槍打殺。如要證明可把逆屍的致命傷來檢察一下，傷口左輪子彈，而且當塲僅有虎弟一人，用的左輪，其餘　是盒子砲，德式十響等。</p>

<h3>郁案</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>兩路舞弊案，昨天宣判了，張鴻圖郁香巖各判處徒刑十五年，最輕的那班商人如金雲亭，曹祖新等也各判徒刑三年六個月，而所引用的條文，都是根據懲治貪汚條例第三條第六款，我們對於法律是外行，不過酌情論理，總覺得這一判決値得研究。</p>
<p>第一·佣金之在今日的中國，幾成一公開的秘密，請問哪一個機關的採辦，沒有一點油水，有許多雖不是直接拿錢，而變相的餽贈，如授受名貴的禮品，與納賄貪汚又有什麼兩樣；而且要辦，商人處於被動地位，倘使經手人不表示，商人也決不敢行賄。</p>
<p>第二·兩路局材料處這樣的一筆舞弊案，而旦連續數月之久，部屬犯罪，主管能否毫不知情，法院應否確實調査？丟開法律問題不談，在行政王管的責任上，是否應負失察之咎，凡此，都是我們所極欲尋求解答的。</p>
<p>貪墨橫行，賄賂公開，量刑從嚴，原具深意，如果只見薪木而不見森林，是捨大就小；如果堵流而不塞源，似乎覺得不够澈底。</p>
<h3>向全世老鼠下總攻擊令</h3>
<p>— 郁强</p>
<p>克特·包羅。李區德博士（CurtPanl　Richter）是在强斯郝柏金大學醫院的費伯氏精神學臨床實騐所研究齧齒類動物的。一九四一年的一個早晨，他在他的實騐室中發現了六頭死老最，每頭都吃過微量的被　定爲無害的一種化學藥品，苯基硫酸　（Phenyl　thiourea）。這種化學藥品曾由數千人嚐試過，對他們都無損害。但是，苯基硫酸脲很顯明的殺了那些老鼠。李區德博士不僅那怎麼是可能的。於是，他的減鼠運動開始了，而戰爭也在進行着。</p>
<p>苯基硫酸脲是已知各物質中味道最苦的東西。關於它有一件奇怪的事情：有的人，大概佔十分之三吧，根本不能嚐它，這種特性在家庭中就有。李區德想知道這種奇異的差異是否也存在於鼠類中。於是，他把苯基硫酸脲的結晶體分別放在他的實驗室的老鼠的舌頭上。沒有一頭老鼠有「不堪下嚥」的樣子。而後來她們都死了。</p>
<p>李區德將苯基硫酸脲混合在飲水中給其他的老鼠喝。牠們像喝普通的水一樣的迅速的喝下去了。結果，牠們都死了。而且牠們死得不像吃了其他毒物一般，却如同患劇烈的胸膜炎而死。牠們的胸腔和肺充滿了水，眞如溺死一樣。</p>
<p>經過多年的研究，知道老鼠有一種神秘的本能，知道避免飲食有書的或者有毒的食物。可是苯基硫酸　似乎是此規律的一個例外。</p>
<p>但是李區德的賓騐室內過着拘囚生活的老鼠的生殖力，逐漸小了。牠們的野生的堂兄弟也如此容易受愚嗎？李區德從垃圾堆裏捉住了幾頭活的老鼠，但是牠們對含有致命的數量的苯基硫酸脉的食物或水碰也不碰。</p>
<p>遇到這種情形，大多數的人都要放棄硏究了。但是李區德知道苯基硫酸脲是一個廣大的化學族中的一份子。從E．I．　du　Pout　de　Nemonrs公司裏他得到了兩百多種不同的硫酸脲化合物。其中一種證明能毒死野鼠如苯基硫酸脲毒死馴養的老鼠一樣。藥瓶的標籤上寫着：Alpha-naparhyl-thiourea李區德就將爲首各字縮短聯結起來，名之曰：「安妥」（ANTU）</p>
<p>這種化學藥品價錢很便宜，在美國每磅祗要四塊錢。李區德發現祗要二十萬分之一磅的「安妥」就可致最壯健的老鼠於死地了。熱中於李區德的報吿，華盛頓便資助他繼續研究。</p>
<p>當時所有最厲害的殺鼠藥是硫酸　，李區德研究出來，「安妥」比　的殺鼠力强兩倍。</p>
<p>於是，開始眞正的實騐。一種老鼠毒藥可能在實騐室內成績超異，但是它在室外也一樣的有效嗎？因爲當地的人都恨老鼠猖獗，念切的需要劇烈的滅鼠的東西，因此，李區德要找帮手，毫無困難。</p>
<p>滅鼠者，都是自願者，分成了幾隊。每一隊分掌一區，而在每一幢房十至少要徵募一個人帮忙。各隊在一個下午將有毒的餌食分佈擺列，次日更精細的計算。有一區，在第二天早晨，發現一百頭死老鼠。</p>
<p>李區德知道老鼠有保持身體潔凈的癖性。他便想出一種散播毒藥的妙法，便是用噴射器裝滿「安妥」向老鼠洞中散播。當老鼠發覺牠的毛上或爪上黏着外來之物時，牠就會用舌頭去舐掉它，而因此一命嗚呼。</p>
<p>這種方法由金城實用的結果，在十二個月內收集到十五萬六千二百十頭死老鼠，而滅鼠者相信眞正毒死的老鼠的數量，要比這個數目大三倍。</p>
<p>有了「安妥」，老鼠跳樑可以大爲减少了。</p>
<p>從此，向全世界老鼠下總攻擊令</p>

<p>窮人無樂趣，這是千古不易的　　。</p>
<p>但我的窮，還不至　衣　　，　　　　，布衣　，菜飯　，妻不啻　，兒不號寥。但一年收入一年了，一無積蓄一無依恃，就靠老天可憐，賜予一副不病身。涉世以來，從未呻吟於床第十朝八日，間有小不適，亦不　動「大夫」，「方脈」，也能不藥而愈，我個人如此，我妻兒老小，也是如此，雖然度了百歲之半，後顧尙在茫茫，然而已覺「得天獨　」了！</p>
<p>我是一個窮人，我是一個一無積蓄，一無依恃的窮人，我每年每日就是這樣「做我應倣」的，博幾個努力的代價來維持我一家的生活。我得的代價，可以稱得起「仰不愧天」，「俯不怍人」，內心是從無一日不安的，不「提心弔膽」不「趨炎附勢」，「量入爲出」，「屛絕應酬」，就因爲我的落落性情，於是那班淸高的咸目我「聖人」，熱中的遂不能禁他以「絕人」目我了。我呢？我行我素。</p>

<p>我在故鄕如此，我流亡來上海亦是如此，上海的確較我故鄕熱鬧多了，然而我並不覺得她熱鬧，祗覺得她煩囂，我若不是被惡劣環境逼迫，我眞的不願一日居。</p>
<p>，最近一年，我還是每日做我應做，博幾個勞心力　代價，來維持我一家的生活。我得的代價，仍然和故鄕一樣　「仰不　天」，「俯不怍人」，內心是從無一日不安　不　提心弔膽」，不一趨炎附」　　　　　　　人爲出　　　　　。我還是我的一貫作風。</p>
<p>但，上海究竟是我生命史上的一個新環境，我不能辜負了　名聞全世的地方，同時我也不能如「老僧入定，而　九年」、公餘之暇，我也曾到處溜躂溜躂，可是馬路上的「亂」，我眞有些心動神搖，電車的風馳，汽車的電掣，三輪車，黃包車的亂鑽、加之馬路兩旁的店家，竭盡招徠顧客的能事、我是安步當車慣了的。這簡直是剝奪了我的權利，所以我發誓不作第一回溜躂。然而我覺得我的生活太單調了，幸而我有志同道合的一個友人，也是流亡的一分子，承他情送我一張長期公園人門券，這是任何公園都可遊觀的，我在星期假日，遂以公園調劑我單調的生活了。每値星期假日帶了兩本愛看的書，買上幾包起碼的紙烟，這是我遊公園的額外開支，平常我吸的紙烟，都是罐頭的，這在衆目睽睽的地方，自己也覺得不雅觀，所以遊公園的這一天，我最愜意的就是「一枝徐吸」，「悠然自得」的窮樂。</p>
<p>公園是太可留戀了，尤其是「虹口」的「中正公園」，進得門去，一片綠茵，眼界爲之一新，紅紫色的小花。不帶一些富貴，繁華氣燄，小立短橋，寵辱皆忘，荷葉亭亭，更撓畫意。</p>
<p>我是個窮人，但我未改吾樂。如果說這是老氣橫秋，我也情願接受。</p>
<p>國外妙聞</p>
<h3>離婚的理由</h3>
<p>— 陳中繩</p>
<p>「有配偶之人與人通姦，」，在我國刑法上有處罰的明文，至於沒有配偶的人與人通姦呢，法律雖不罰，在道德上也是被詬爲寡廉鮮恥的。所以一般人在事實上雖有通姦行爲，表面上總愛掩掩蓋蓋，免得旁言嗤嘖，但是在美國紐約州却不然，某些人他們根本行爲謹嚴，毫無不端，但是却願意說自己確曾與人通姦。</p>
<p>原來美國各州的離婚法，並不像傳說中地那樣自由，譬如說我們中國法律准許配偶間可以協議離婚，但是美國却沒有一州是允許當事人協議離婚的。反之每州法律都列舉可以離婚的原因，有這種原因的才得請求法院判令離婚，其中紐約州的法律就以通姦爲離婚的唯一原因。而假通姦也就因此而產生。</p>
<p>有時候紀的夫婦因爲情意不投，同意離異，各奔前程，但法律旣不准協議離婚，判決離婚又限於通姦一項，所以紐約的怨偶們於議定離婚後，爲求得法律上的效力，不得不倒因爲果，來表演假通姦，以達離婚的目的。</p>
<h3>胸有成竹</h3>
<p>— 許盈譯自「新聞週刋」</p>
<p>德國最近流傳着一個帶有諷刺性的笑話。據說，一個法國的新聞記者在巴黎和會開會的時候曾經訪問過一位美國著名的原子彈專家並問道：「美國需要幾隻原子彈才能毁滅法國呢？一那位原子科學家於是反問了一大串的問題如法國國內有幾多大城市，有幾多水電廠等等。他參考過這些材料之後就在一張紙上計算了一大堆非常複雜的算題。最後他答「一共需要一百三十二隻。」</p>
<p>那儸法國人立刻現出一副哭喪臉的神情。然後，他又問：「那末，需要幾隻原子彈來毁滅比利士呢？」美國人聽了，像煞有介事的算了一番，說：「四十三個」法國記者最後又問：「那末，需要幾隻原子彈來摧毁蘇聯呢？」美國原子彈專家立刻把那張紙擺入袋裏去，馬上答道：「一千二百六十九隻」。</p>
<p>正是：胸有成竹，無需考慮。人類就是這樣準備毁滅於自己了。</p>
<h3>日軍的集團自殺　戰爭史實</h3>
<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<p>日軍的野蠻，殘忍，是舉世所憎惡的，但是他們忠貞國家，捨身就義的精神，確是很可驚人。下面是追述日軍前於菲列賓慘敗後一幕可歌可泣的「集團自殺」大悲劇。</p>
<p>美方曾於呂宋島搜得敵軍的文件，這文件是由日閥長官强制其在菲律賓作戰受傷的八萬餘士軍，執行死刑或自殺的命令，許多被處死的日軍，大部份是在馬尼剌最劇烈的一役中所受傷。下面是譯述前日軍駐馬尼剌中央司令所發命令的內容：</p>
<p>「每一隊伍內，凡屬受傷，患病，或不能作戰鬬行爲的，希各帶二天的口糧，聚於堡壘的轉角，準備於二十一日（不知何月）或前後，實行集才自殺。每隊的指揮官，須派一負責人，到塲監視死亡。當自殺以前，准予一日一夜的自由思慮，俾每人可充分考量其樂於爲國犧牲的決定。」</p>
<p>該文件又指出將受傷者殺死，亦常符合「萬歲」（日軍衝鋒時口號）衝鋒的命令。</p>
<p>又曾發現前日軍駐馬尼刺司令的同樣文件，其大意如下：</p>
<p>「當總攻擊以前，凡已經受傷者，均應自殺，並將一切文件雜物燬滅。在總攻擊一役中，均須光榮地捨身成仁，勿使一入被擒被俘，蹤有受傷，應由共同伍友人，促其自殺。」</p>
<p>有一個被擒的日本海軍軍官說：他的司令官曾對他說，「戰局是沒有希望了，去吿訴醫院內的受傷者，準備光榮的死亡」。這位軍官曾接受其部下二人的請求，以劍將彼等刺死。凡是不願自殺，亦必被殺。他們的軍醫院是設於地下，每一病房，均經炸毁，院內一應人等，俱活活葬在地下。</p>
<p>上面的悲劇，可謂驚天地而泣鬼神，我人平心地想，他們忠勇報國視死如歸的精神，確是硬得非凡。可惜這樣野蠻成性的愚忠，對國家是無補的！</p>
<h3>無題</h3>
<p>— 孟拓</p>
<p>美國商會會長瓊司頓於一九四四年遊歷蘇聯時，曾作公開演說。當述及美國共產黨時，他說：「蘇聯吃胡椒，他們（指美共黨）打噴嚏；蘇聯不消化，他們喉頭骨骨作噯氣。」</p>
<h3>週末茶話</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>英文大美晚報上星期有一段評論，說是據歷史的記載，現代的中國×軍從未打過勝仗，但却有許多有趣的事應該載入永久記錄中。這所謂有趣的事，實在在我們是最沒趣的；他們有頭有尾的指出了中國×軍×艦中什麽號什麽號怎樣在「努力走私」；亞洲社瓊崖通訊裏面更寫着大批接收下來的敵僞物資就是被這些什麼號偸運出去的事實？聯合社廣州電則更是「×軍」「海盜」的鬧個不淸，使人眼花撩亂，不過結果却有一段按語說「此數艦原屬中國×軍，但究爲海盜擄刧，抑係自動甘心爲盜，尙不能確定。」幸虧有這麽一句話，我們的「憂國之心」給安定了不少。打斷胳膊朝裏灣，儘管「從未打過勝仗」已經是賴不脫，辯不淸的陳跡了，但是我們總還希望這次「沒趣」的事情將來能够「査係不確」，或者用一點事實來表現我們×軍實在是「努力爲公」或「係爲海盜擄刧」的，免得被人家在若十年後，再「根據歷史的記載」留下些什麽「有趣的事」的記錄來！</p>
<p>據海關統計本年度從一月份起至八月份止，各國輸入中國的奶粉餅乾，糖食，咖啡等的總値是一四·九五四·八二七·〇〇〇元；我國輸往海外各國的茶葉，毛茶，磚茶等的總値是二·〇四一·四二一·〇〇〇元，單單這一項的入超就七倍於輸出額而有餘；此外還有各國輸華的紙菸，雪茄，紙菸紙等的總値是一七·七六一·九一四·〇〇〇元，我國輸往海外的菸絲，菸葉等的總値僅有一·三九七·八〇七，〇〇〇元，相當於輸入額的十四分之一弱。這數目又恰巧是食品入超數額的一倍；其他補品，奢侈品的入超數字，我們不忍再寫出來了，這不能不令人聯想到國貨商塲中的玻璃皮包和國貨上洋文的商標。「提倡國貨」云云，倒底是怎麽一回事，於此可知。記得十幾年前在抵制日貨運動中，許多售賣日貨的店裏，在被打得落花流水之餘，曾說過這麼一句話：「我們並不是喪心病在，人家的東西價廉物美，我們原祗知道揀本輕利重的生意做啊！」言猶在耳，拿來和現在許多「美貨攤販」還鬼鬼祟祟地縮在小弄堂裏做着孤注招徠的情景一對照，眞不知道這是否就是我們中國的宿命的悲哀？</p>
<p>「虞美人」</p>
<p>據南京報紙載：有某機關最近蒙上面體恤，撥到一筆冬衣費，除了用一部份替全體職員做了一套制服外，關於大衣部份，經總務人員請准收購現在已接收拍賣的日軍遺留之軍用大衣加以染色後分發。每件折價廿萬元，詎料全體職員早就渴待新絮禦寒，怎願意買此舊衣，故請由一科長領銜簽呈，要求停止購染，發款讓大家自購新裝，消息傳到總務人員耳裏，立刻暴跳如雷，跑到這位科長面前打起官話來：「此舉是×長批准的，你們有什麽理由反對？」聽說各職員到現在爲止尙未就範，這事果千眞萬確，我倒想奉勸那些職員先生們一聲。且看有詞爲證（虞美人）：營私揩油何時了，都綠鈔票少！大衣改染怎遮風，算盤却在總務肚皮中；簽呈雖上批示在，據說不准改；由來經手必抽頭，冷點算了何苦結免仇！</p>
<p>謹防炸彈</p>
<p>消息傳來，湘贛鄂淸査團在武漢居然拜領了一宗「逐客」的盛禮，那是「接收同人」請團長仇先生「心照不宣」的「緊急警吿」。哀的美敦書中頗多妙文，最精彩的當然是提示欽差們「淸査工作，適可而止，」因爲「儻　之物，干爾島事？」所以結論「再不滾蛋，謹防炸彈。」有人說這封信簡直是强盜口吻，但我以爲倒不必看得這麽嚴重；試問目前社會上還不多的是强盜心理？堂堂接收重任，怎會忘記了「經手不窮」的原則？淸査人員在接收大員的心目中至少是認爲「沒有上方寳劍，怕他做甚？」所以作要公事公辦，那眞是自討沒趣了。聽說這次事件，團方處理得很妥貼，因爲他們已決定「此函正可作爲本團同仁對中央之工作報吿，」一天雲霧，自然即將消散，但我們小民總覺得有點「我志未酬人亦苦，東南到處有啼痕」的感喟罷了！</p>

<h3>Grand Ceremony for the First Anniversary of Taiwan's Retrocession: Enthusiastic Welcome for the Chairman and His Wife</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] The Chairman, accompanied by his wife, attended the Retrocession Commemoration Welcome Rally at 10:22 AM on the 25th. The wife entered first, followed by the Chairman and Chen Yi with his wife. There were five minutes of cheers, and the Chairman smiled and nodded in acknowledgment. After Chairman Huang, representing the Taiwanese people, paid respects, the Chairman delivered a speech lasting thirty minutes, greeted by thunderous applause from over two thousand representatives from all walks of life. The Chairman, holding his military cap, said with a smile: "Thank you, fellow compatriots." He then met with the public on the balcony in front of the Retrocession Hall, repeatedly saying: "Thank you." It is historically significant that Zhongshan Hall was where the surrender took place last year, and now the Chairman has personally come.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] The welcome rally for the Chairman and his wife on the anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession was held on the morning of the 25th at Taipei Zhongshan Hall. The rally was originally scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM, but was delayed until 10:20 AM due to welcoming crowds obstructing the Chairman and his wife's car en route. They arrived accompanied by Chief Executive Chen Yi. The crowd standing in front of the venue cheered, their voices echoing in the sky. Party, government, and military leaders greeted them and led them inside. Over two thousand representatives from various organizations, schools, and groups stood up in unison to pay their respects. The Chairman, in military uniform, looked radiant and cheerful. The wife wore a navy blue floral qipao with a black coat. The whole venue erupted in enthusiastic applause and cheers. Mayor You Mijian announced the start of the rally. After formal salutations, Provincial Assembly Speaker Huang Chaoqin stood before the platform and respectfully read a tribute to the Chairman (separate dispatch). The Chairman nodded frequently in thanks. The Chairman then delivered a speech (full text in separate dispatch), which Mayor You translated into Taiwanese. The entire audience listened intently and silently, without any signs of fatigue. Afterward, Youth Corps Secretary Wang Wenhui and Women's Association Wu Qianqian, representing the people and women of the province respectively, presented the Chairman and his wife with banners reading "Merit Shines Throughout the Universe" and "Virtue Permeates Formosa," respectively, amidst melodious music. The Chairman and his wife accepted the banners with smiles, and the entire venue thundered with applause. Mayor You then led the crowd in chanting: "Long live Chairman Chiang, who has worked hard and made great contributions!" "Long live Chairman Chiang, who brought glorious victory!" "Long live Chairman Chiang, who recovered Taiwan!" "Long live Mrs. Chiang!" "Long live Taiwan of the Republic of China!" "Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party!" "Long live the Republic of China!" The rally concluded with cheers. As the Chairman and his wife stepped down from the podium, they waved their hats to the audience and said: "Good, good, fellow compatriots, goodbye, goodbye." The Chairman and others then entered the VIP room to rest for five minutes before going to the rooftop terrace to receive cheers and tributes from over ten thousand people gathered outside Zhongshan Hall. The Chairman then delivered another brief address, saying: "Compatriots, today is the happiest day for Zhongzheng and his wife. Seeing you all, I am truly overwhelmed with joy. What I want to encourage all Taiwanese compatriots is that I hope you will work especially hard for the motherland, for Taiwan, so that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People can be realized, and a unified, independent, democratic, and Three Principles-based new China can be built. I wish all compatriots good health!" As soon as the address was finished, the crowd shouted: "Long live Chairman Chiang!" At this moment, the Chairman also raised his hand and shouted: "Long live the Taiwanese compatriots! Long live! Long, long live!" Taiwan was under Japanese rule from May 9, 1895, to October 25, 1945, for 50 years, 5 months, and 16 days. It was the first time in history that the Taiwanese people had witnessed the demeanor of the head of the motherland. The high emotions of the Taiwanese people today clearly moved the Chairman deeply. The Chairman then left the venue and went by car to National Taiwan University to attend the opening ceremony of the provincial sports meet.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the news that Chairman Chiang and his wife would attend the welcome rally this morning spread, various schools, organizations, and citizens waited along the scheduled route early in the morning, holding small national flags in their hands. The Chairman and his wife, accompanied by Chief Executive Chen Yi, departed from the Government House in a jeep. When they reached Jiantan Bridge, they were blocked by welcoming crowds on both sides, so they slowly proceeded through the crowds along Zhongshan Road, Zhongzheng Road, Chongqing South Road, and Hengyang Street to reach the Zhongshan Hall venue. The cheers of "Long live" from the people along the way never stopped. The Chairman stood in the jeep, smiling and nodding frequently to both sides, and waving his hand. At 10:20 AM, the car arrived at Zhongshan Hall, and the crowd waiting in front of the gate also cheered, their voices echoing in the sky. The air force also sent planes to fly overhead and distribute propaganda materials.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Today is the anniversary of Taipei's retrocession, and grand rallies are being held in all counties and cities to celebrate. Telegrams of respect were sent to Chairman Chiang and Chief Executive Chen Yi.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Address</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] The full text of Chairman Chiang's address at the welcome rally for the Chairman and his wife on the anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession on the 25th is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Compatriots:</p>
<p>Today, as we joyfully celebrate the first anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession, I, Zhongzheng, have come to attend this celebration rally, to gather with my Taiwanese compatriots who have been separated for fifty years, to celebrate the retrocession together. It is truly the most pleasant and glorious day of my life, fulfilling my fifty-year-long aspiration.</p>
<p>Our Taiwan Province was ceded to Japanese imperialism by the foolish Qing government on April 17th of the Jiawu Year (1895), and has been under enemy occupation for as long as fifty-one years. During these fifty-one years of suffering, the compatriots of Taiwan Province not only suffered oppression by the Japanese, enduring various political and economic abuses and inequalities, but all of our compatriots across the country were also constantly concerned about this island that was robbed, and the compatriots on the island who were forcibly separated. Our Founding Father advocated the National Revolution, with the retrocession of Taiwan as one of the main goals of the revolution. In the year that Taiwan was lost, the Founding Father established the Revive China Society in Honolulu, and in the declaration issued at the time, he put forward the slogan "Restore Taiwan, consolidate China." Since then, our national revolutionaries, as well as Zhongzheng himself, have worked tirelessly in accordance with the Founding Father's teachings, determined to wash away national humiliation and fully restore Taiwan. In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), our entire country unanimously launched the sacred and heroic war of resistance against Japan, and the retrocession of Taiwan became an active goal for our revolutionary comrades. Therefore, on April 1st of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), I clearly announced at the Provisional National Congress of the Kuomintang: "Taiwan is our Chinese territory, and geographically, it is the lifeline related to China's survival and security. If China wants to truly pursue national defense and maintain lasting peace in East Asia, we must never allow our Taiwan to be permanently ruled by Japanese imperialism. In order to achieve our National Revolution and prevent ambitious countries from disrupting East Asia, we must target the active conspiracies of Japanese imperialism and make the liberation of the Taiwanese people our mission." This is what the Founding Father often instructed me personally and other comrades. The Founding Father meant that we must enable the Taiwanese compatriots to restore equality and freedom in politics and economy, and enable every Taiwanese compatriot to restore their status as the masters of the country, so that we can consolidate the national defense of the Republic of China and lay the foundation for peace in East Asia.</p>
<h3>President Soong Arrives in Shanghai by Plane</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Premier Soong Tzu-wen arrived in Shanghai by plane from Hefei at 1:30 PM on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] Premier Soong's special plane left Taiwan at 10:30 AM on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Attending the Cairo Conference: Determined to Recover Taiwan</h3>
<p>With the determination and perseverance of the people of the whole country, enduring countless losses and sacrifices of lives and property, we waged a tenacious and heroic war of resistance against the brutal Japanese. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), I personally went to Cairo to hold a tripartite conference with the leaders of Britain and the United States, and decided that Japan should "return to China all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the four northeastern provinces." Thus, Taiwan, which we had lost for fifty years, was determined to be a part of our Republic of China. On August 15th of last year (1945), the Japanese military completely collapsed and declared unconditional surrender to our Allies. Our country immediately proceeded with the work of recovering the lost territories according to the pre-arranged plan, and with the enthusiastic assistance of our friend, the United States, all the restoration work was able to be completed smoothly. On this day last year, our Central Government specially appointed the current Chief Executive Chen to come to Taiwan as the Administrative Chief Executive of your Taiwan Province and Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison to accept the surrender and administer the government. Compatriots, today last year was the day when Taiwan Province was officially incorporated into our country's territory.</p>
<h3>Remember the Revolutionary Martyrs: Expand the Spirit of Patriotism</h3>
<p>Compatriots, today is truly the most precious day for all our compatriots across the country, and especially the most glorious day for the compatriots of Taiwan Province. Everyone must know that the retrocession of Taiwan is a major achievement that is extremely difficult and hard-won. Since our Founding Father initiated the revolution, for the sake of the compatriots and land of Taiwan, we have been engaged in a long-term and continuous fierce and painful struggle with Japanese imperialism, whether visible or invisible, at all times. During this war of resistance, our compatriots across the country have suffered countless direct and indirect sacrifices, and we do not know how much blood of patriots has been shed, and how many heads of compatriots have been lost, before this Taiwan, which had been occupied for fifty-one years, returned to the embrace of the motherland. However, during these fifty-one years, although our Taiwanese compatriots suffered such brutal oppression from the enemy, the traditional spirit of the Chinese national revolution has not been lost in the slightest. Since the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, after the national hero Zheng Chenggong resisted the Manchus and restored Taiwan, Tang Jingsong, Liu Yongfu, Qiu Fengjia, and others continuously led the Taiwanese people to resist the brutal Japanese, all of which were glorious and tragic acts that shocked the heavens and moved the gods. Even during the Japanese occupation, the anti-Japanese movement of the compatriots in this province continued unabated. Events such as the Lin Dabe incident and the Jian Dashi incident were all expressions of the patriotic revolutionary spirit. I deeply hope that all compatriots in the province will remember the historical facts of the national and Taiwanese revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed generously and restored Taiwan with great difficulty. From now on, we should endure hardship, unite and cooperate, expand the patriotic and revolutionary spirit and perseverance of the martyrs, and work together to build a new Taiwan and a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek Receives Taiwanese Women Leaders</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, at 5:00 PM on the 25th, after receiving US Consul Blake, Vice Consul Kyle, US Information Service Director Catto and Mrs. Catto, also received Ge Yunyi, lecturer at Taiwan Normal College, Ren Peidao, principal of Taipei Women's Normal School, Xie E, chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Women's Association, Zhu Xiurong, principal of Fuxing Kindergarten, and more than ten directors of women's associations in various counties and cities. Mrs. Chiang encouraged the women of Taiwan Province to engage in the following: (1) Participate in various activities to cultivate women's political awareness. (2) Engage in productive enterprises to improve the lives of women in Taiwan Province. (3) Establish nurseries. (4) Recruit women party members. Mrs. Chiang also asked Mrs. Chen Yi to serve as the chairman of the Taiwan branch of the Women's Guidance Association.</p>
<h3>Rebuild Taiwan: Become a National Model</h3>
<p>Compatriots, it has been a full year since Taiwan Province was restored to our nation. Although I have been unable to come to Taiwan to comfort my compatriots this year due to the busy affairs of the country, my thoughts of the compatriots of Taiwan Province have never ceased. Based on reports from various sources, I am deeply aware of the long-term suffering endured by the compatriots in this province during the occupation, and I also know that the compatriots in this province have suffered considerable losses and destruction during the war. After the retrocession, due to the war-time destruction, there have been many difficulties and obstacles in the work of restoration and reconstruction. Although this suffering and these difficulties are all remnants of the exploitation by Japanese imperialism, now that Taiwan has returned to the embrace of our motherland, and every one of our compatriots has become the master of the country, we should all do our utmost to fulfill our responsibilities and obligations as masters of the country, quickly eliminate the remnants of Japanese militarism, and rebuild Taiwan anew.</p>
<p>Regarding the work of restoration and reconstruction, on the one hand, the local government must actively promote it, and on the other hand, all our compatriots in the province must cooperate fully, coordinating and advancing towards one goal and one direction, in order to successfully complete the task. The material conditions in this province are quite favorable, national education is very popular, and the people's representative bodies have all been established. With the joint efforts of the people and the government, under the leadership of Chief Executive Chen, I believe that the future of Taiwan Province will be bright and promising, and it will surely become a model province for the whole country.</p>
<h3>Cherishing All Compatriots in the Province: Far More Than Any Other Province</h3>
<p>As for our Central Government's view of Taiwan, it is like brothers and sisters who have been separated from their family for fifty years, and the emotions of reunion and gathering together once they return home. Only those who have personally experienced it can thoroughly understand this feeling of pity and love, only hoping that they can be happier and more advanced, and not be discouraged, passive, disappointed, or disheartened because of the enemy's attacks. Therefore, the quick completion of the restoration of this province is not only eagerly anticipated by the compatriots of this province, but also by the Central Government. For all matters that are reasonable and beneficial to the restoration and construction of Taiwan, the Central Government has been constantly urging and instructing the Chief Executive's Office to actively promote them. Today, I can announce to all the compatriots in the province that the Central Government's love for Taiwan far exceeds that of any other province in the country, and the Central Government's emphasis on the construction of Taiwan also exceeds that of other provinces. I hope that all our compatriots in the province can work together and strive harder to build a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People, and fulfill your responsibilities as masters of the country, because building a new Taiwan is part of building a new China, and building a new China is the ultimate goal of our National Revolution.</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession, and I am able to personally see the compatriots who have suffered enemy oppression for as long as fifty-one years, celebrating wildly under the banner of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, and my heart is filled with unspeakable joy. Now, I pray for the blessings of heaven, and silently pray to the spirits of the Founding Father and the revolutionary martyrs in heaven, so that our Taiwanese compatriots can be stronger, more advanced, more free, and more happy, in order to fulfill your mission of restoring the country!</p>
<h3>Opening of the First Taiwan Provincial Games: Chairman Encourages All Young Athletes to Take on the Responsibility of Building Taiwan in the Future</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th Dispatch] The first Taiwan Provincial Games opened at 11:30 AM on the 25th. The Chairman and his wife, and Chief Executive Chen and his wife, arrived at the venue ten minutes before the opening. When the ceremony began, Wang Chengzhang, the general director of the Games, reported that 26 participating units and 2,500 athletes marched around the track. After Chief Executive Chen, chairman of the Games, led the salutations, the Chairman delivered a speech (speech follows). Then, Mr. Hao Gengsheng, representative of the Ministry of Education, delivered a speech. Mr. Hao expressed the hope that Taiwan Province would have a complete plan for promoting sports, and announced that next year's National Games had been designated by Chairman Chiang to be held in Nanjing on Double Ten Day. The ceremony concluded at 12:30 PM. The Chairman and his wife then returned to the Government House by car.</p>
<p>Also, Chairman Chiang and his wife held a tea party at the Taipei Guest House at 4:00 PM on the 25th, receiving people from all walks of life and allied countries.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Full Text of Chairman Chiang's speech at the Provincial Games on the 25th:</p>
<p>Athletes, young people, and children of the Taiwan Provincial Games:</p>
<p>Today, Zhongzheng and his wife have come to Taiwan to participate in the Taiwan Provincial Games and to meet with our Taiwanese young people and children, and I feel immensely gratified in my heart. Our Taiwan has been separated from the motherland for fifty-one years. Fortunately, with the long-term and arduous struggle of our compatriots across the country, we were finally able to liberate our Taiwan from the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism on this day last year, allowing our Taiwanese compatriots to return to the embrace of the motherland and gain a position of freedom and equality. This is truly a major event worthy of our joy and encouragement. However, everyone must know that you have now returned to the embrace of the motherland and have become the masters of the Republic of China, and therefore must shoulder the responsibilities of the country. This time, Zhongzheng has come to Taiwan to entrust the responsibility of building Taiwan and the responsibility of building the country to our compatriots - especially our Taiwanese young people. I hope that our compatriots, especially young people, can all recognize their responsibilities, work together to study diligently, cultivate strong physiques, and restore the inherent morality of our Chinese nation, that is, to understand propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, to be responsible, and to abide by discipline. Only in this way can we ensure the status of the masters of our country, consolidate our territory of Taiwan, and fulfill our obligations as the masters of our country. It is also only in this way that we can build our Republic of China into a new country based on the Three Principles of the People, rich, strong, healthy, and happy. Finally, I wish all the young people and children who participate in the Provincial Games today the glory of victory and progress under strict discipline and order.</p>
<h3>The Third Party Continues Its Efforts: Preparing to Put Forward New Proposals: Concrete Conclusions Have Been Reached on Some Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] Peace talks are still in the stage of off-site consultations. Due to the new restrictions of the "propaganda truce," the content of the talks cannot be fully disclosed to the outside world. However, according to observations, this kind of off-site consultation is making the opinions of both sides closer. The third party is continuing its efforts, hoping to facilitate the immediate opening of a formal meeting. At 10:40 AM on the 25th, Luo Longji, Miao Jiaming, and Li Huang went to the US Embassy to visit Ambassador Stuart, and Special Envoy Marshall also came to participate. At that time, Pi Zonggan, advisor to the National Government, was also present. The third party reported the progress of the talks over the past few days to Marshall and Stuart. The two expressed their agreement with the content of the proposals being formulated by the third party. Then, Yu described in detail the meetings with government officials in recent days, and left at about 12:00 PM. Also, the letter sent by the third party to Sun Ke yesterday urging the chairman to return to Nanjing as soon as possible was telegraphed to the chairman by Wu Dingchang, secretary-general of the National Government, on the morning of the 25th. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"To Mr. Zhesheng: As instructed by the chairman during the meeting, we have been engaged in informal consultations in recent days. The consensus of the third party is that there is a need to seek instructions from the chairman on some issues.

We are delighted to have our great leader Chairman Chiang and his wife visiting Taiwan. All Taiwanese compatriots feel infinite excitement and happiness. This is the most glorious day for all Taiwanese compatriots, and it is also a day of special historical significance. Everyone knows that it was thanks to Chairman Chiang's leadership in the arduous long-term war of resistance that our China was able to be revived, and the retrocession of this province today is due to Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang's negotiations at the Cairo Conference three years ago, which won the strong guarantee of the two major allies, Britain and the United States, and laid the foundation for this new situation. Fifty-one years ago, Taiwan fell into the hands of the enemy. During this period, Taiwanese compatriots suffered hardship and humiliation, but they always missed the motherland. Therefore, they have been able to preserve the culture, language, writing, customs, and habits of this motherland to this day. Today, our compatriots throughout the province have returned to the embrace of the motherland, accepted the inspiration of the Three Principles of the People, and jointly obtained the happiness of equality and freedom. Moreover, the cause of all restoration and construction is progressing, and the future is unlimited. We respectfully swear that under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, we will work hard to build the country, contribute all the human and material resources of Taiwan to the motherland, so that every Taiwanese person can become a powerful member of the country's construction, and make Taiwan a powerful province for the country's construction. Only in this way can we repay the merits of our great leader, and repay our country and nation. On behalf of the 6.3 million compatriots in the province, we express our highest respect and deepest gratitude to our Chairman and Mrs. Chiang! We respectfully request the Chairman and Mrs. Chiang to provide us with more instructions so that we can follow them, and we respectfully wish the Chairman and Mrs. Chiang good health."</p>

Only with a strong replacement can decadent music be driven out."</p>
<h3>Zhang Daofan Encourages the Music Community; Should Be Able to Do What Others Cannot</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Mr. Zhang Daofan, at the reception of the Lifeng Society at 4:00 p.m. on the 22nd, spoke about the music movement and said: "We originally thought that after the victory of the War of Resistance, music activities and education could develop rapidly in a good new environment. Unexpectedly, a year after the victory, the national situation is still like this. The music community, like the people of the whole country, has fallen into a difficult situation again. Those who cause trouble cannot escape their blame. We do not need to see clearly who is causing trouble. We should strive to do what others cannot do in any difficulty with a revolutionary spirit, and there can still be amazing achievements." He also hopes that the music community will unite and devote itself to two things: (1) Perform more, so that the public understands music, and then it will be easy for the public to be vigilant; (2) Promote more, and spread music scores and theoretical books as widely as possible. He himself is determined to do his best to assist. The reception was hosted by Xiong Leiluo, president of the society, and was attended by more than 50 people from the cultural and news circles. There was also a wonderful program of national music at the end of the meeting.</p>

<h3>Actively Developing the China Petroleum Corporation; Ganqing Branch Established in the Northwest</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Our reporter recently interviewed Mr. Xu Zhuanghuai, Chief Secretary of the China Petroleum Corporation, inquiring about the company's recent work. He responded that in terms of production, the Ganqing Petroleum Branch has been established in the Northwest to continue developing the Yumen Oil Field. The oil refining equipment ordered from the United States had previously arrived in batches, but unfortunately, a significant amount was lost during the Communist army's attack on the Longhai Railway line. Therefore, the development of the oil field has been considerably affected. Exploration work in the Northwest is still ongoing in the hope of discovering new oil sources. As for the Wusu Oil Field in Xinjiang, it was shut down due to the removal of machinery, and due to the situation, it has not yet been repaired. Recently, the company has begun repairing the Kaohsiung oil refinery in Taiwan, which was left behind by the Japanese and was previously used to refine naval oil. Once operations begin, its output can supply the southeastern coastal area. Regarding the management of imported petroleum, the detailed figures cannot be disclosed due to their confidential nature. What can be said is that the imported petroleum and diesel are divided into three parts: military and transportation agencies consume the largest quantity, and their allocation is prioritized; secondly, the oil required by private enterprises can also be requested according to procedures, based on their actual needs; thirdly, the remaining petroleum is handed over to Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco for commercial use. The purpose of managing petroleum is not passive control but to seek fair and reasonable allocation and to maintain stable oil prices.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Commentary on Recent Events Concerning Christian Churches</h3>
<p>Amidst the turbulent international situation of today, news related to Christian churches has been occurring frequently lately. The execution of the Yugoslav archbishop has aroused dissatisfaction from the Vatican. According to news from Agence France-Presse, the Pope in Rome is also planning to issue a statement condemning it. While this formal condemnation from the Holy See has not yet been released, news agencies from Rome are reporting that a Yugoslav girl is planning to assassinate Pope Pius XII. The Vatican has remained silent and made no comment regarding the attempted assassination report. Therefore, the credibility of the aforementioned report is questionable. Regardless of whether there is an actual assassination attempt on the Pope, the existence of such a report suggests that it is not without reason and may have some basis. At the same time, Archbishop Victor of the Russian Orthodox Church in Shanghai was recently arrested by our authorities. According to reports, he is suspected of being a war criminal and has been transferred to the court. It is also reported that he has been released on bail. The arrest of Archbishop Victor has shocked the Russian community in Shanghai. Now that the case has been transferred to the judicial organs for trial, the truth will surely come to light. Therefore, we do not wish to comment on this case. We are merely citing a few examples to show that news concerning Christian churches has been happening frequently recently.</p>
<p>I remember when President Roosevelt was still alive, and the Big Three were still meeting from time to time, Roosevelt and Churchill spoke to Stalin about the importance of the Pope's role in international life. Stalin retorted by asking them how many divisions the Pope possessed. This certainly reflects a materialistic view: but perhaps Stalin, who was from the Greek, that is, Russian Orthodox Church monastery, was the one who could truly recognize the Pope, who did not possess a single soldier. It is said that Stalin believed that his ultimate enemy was not London or Washington, but the Vatican. Perhaps this is why, in our so-called "liberated areas," the Roman Catholic Church suffered the most from being "liberated" and "liquidated." Tito's Yugoslavia, as everyone knows, has become a vassal of Moscow. Therefore, the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia, like the Catholic Church in Slovakia, is naturally included in the ranks of "liberation" and "liquidation." This is why we have seen the execution of the Archbishop in the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia, and in order to respect and uphold the four freedoms stipulated in the Atlantic Charter, which were also accepted by the Soviet Union, we have seen Catholics everywhere condemning the Yugoslav Archbishop incident.</p>
<p>Communism, in its essence, is a kind of atheistic "religion." This "religion," combined with the intense religious sentiments of the Russian people, makes the Russian people even more aware of their mission. Moscow has been called the "Third Rome," and now the international center of the Communist Party is in Moscow, which makes the Russian people feel that they have a sacred mission to "liberate" all mankind with communism. Therefore, when the revolutionary fervor subsided, when there was war to resist foreign invasion, which aroused the intense religious emotions of the Russian people, Stalin, who came from a Russian Orthodox Church monastery, grabbed the Russian Orthodox Church again and, under the supervision and direction of the Orthodox Church Affairs Committee specially set up by the government, officially became a tool of communism. The Moscow Patriarchate was restored, and with the support of the government, Orthodox Church seminaries were established. The anti-religious sentiment of the early communist era was eliminated; what replaced it was the unity of communism and the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>Originally, since the founding of the Christian Church, its center has been in Rome. After the invasion of Rome by foreign tribes, the Roman Church not only did not decline but became even more prosperous. Throughout the long so-called "Dark Ages" in Western Europe, only the Roman Church was a stable force. The Eastern migration of the Roman imperial family allowed the Roman Church to enter a purely religious realm of separation of church and state. The church in the East, on the other hand, could not always escape the constraints of politics; therefore, the so-called Orthodox Church in the East has always been manipulated by politics. Speaking of this "orthodoxy," this so-called "Orthodox," it is like this. In the Eastern Roman Empire, because the capital was in Byzantium, Constantinople became the "Second Rome," which was "Orthodox." After the Eastern Roman Empire was conquered by the Turks, the Russians claimed the "Orthodoxy," so Moscow had the title of "Third Rome." In fact, according to people who faithfully believe in Christianity, the "orthodoxy" of the "Orthodox" Church is not "Orthodox"—this is still in Rome. Today, the Roman Catholic Church has more than 400 million believers, which shows where the Church's so-called "Holy See" is located. Because of this, the "Third Rome" Moscow believes that Rome is still its ultimate enemy.</p>
<p>The Pope of Rome is a spiritual leader of Catholic believers all over the world who does not possess military force. The news of an attempted assassination by a Yugoslav girl this time is indeed a bit abrupt. Now that there has been no official statement on this report, it remains to be verified. As for the execution of the Archbishop in Yugoslavia, there may be political relations involved. With the expansion of communist forces, we can see the struggle between the "Third Rome" and Rome everywhere. One of the most important factors determining the future destiny of mankind may be the outcome of this struggle!</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Budget Is Pitifully Small!</h3>
<p>The British proudly say, "The sun never sets on the British Empire"; we can also raise our thumbs and say, "Wherever there is seawater, there are Chinese." Originally, we have a popular saying in southern China, "Min and Yue have no land, the sea is their land," no wonder 12 million Overseas Chinese are scattered all over the world, especially in Southeast Asia, which has almost become "the Republic of China overseas." However, our Overseas Chinese compatriots are treated as cattle and horses by the whites, and as "undesirable elements" by their own country. Therefore, the Japanese colonial expert Masayoshi Naganari said to the Overseas Chinese, "A weak nation with strong people," which deeply implies a lot of emotion!</p>
<p>Regarding Overseas Chinese as "undesirable elements" was said by the ignorant rulers of the Qing Dynasty, but even in this ignorant dynasty, overseas inquiry bureaus were established in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Tianjin, and Ningbo, which was more than fifty years before the founding of the Republic of China, in the ninth year of Xianfeng. The inept Beijing government also set up the Overseas Workers Affairs Bureau in the State Council in the seventh year of the Republic of China and renamed it the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau in the eleventh year. Today's Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is the seventh change in history! This is in accordance with the national father’s policy of protecting Overseas Chinese, and was reorganized and established in the twenty-first year under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan after a resolution by the Central Political Conference. Its existence is a matter of course, and its life span is no longer than that. Moreover, the head has never moved, which is thanks to the chairman’s wisdom and the effectiveness of the head.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the twenty-first year, when the association was established, it was a time of national difficulty. They received only 8,000 yuan per month for regular expenses, less than four-tenths of the original budget. The staff only received the minimum living expenses, which was called "national crisis salary" at the time. In June of the twenty-second year, the association’s funding increased to 18,000 yuan, in the twenty-third year it increased to 23,000 yuan, and in the twenty-sixth year it reached 280,000 yuan. During the Anti-Japanese War, all funding was reduced by 30%. In the twenty-eighth year, prices soared in the rear. Only then was the original budget restored. In the thirty-third year, the total cost of each fee was 16 million.</p>
<p>The original budget for this year was approximately 136 million yuan for regular expenses and living subsidies, and 5 million yuan for professional expenses. The ratio of business expenses to regular expenses is approximately 3%. The adjusted budget for regular expenses and living subsidies is approximately 1.3 billion yuan, and business expenses remain the same as before, and its percentage drops to 0.26%.</p>
<p>Their affiliated agencies, such as the Shanghai and Yunnan Overseas Chinese Affairs Offices, received only 290,000 yuan each for the entire year. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Offices in Fujian and Guangdong received 185,000 yuan, and each of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus received only 130,000 yuan per year. Some bureaus only received 7,000 old coins per year. The Overseas Chinese News Agency received approximately 20,000 yuan per month, and other affiliated agencies received only tens of thousands of yuan. At most, it has been increased by four times after the adjustment. This small amount is not enough for one person, how can it become an agency to run a business?</p>
<p>Regarding the resumption of Overseas Chinese affairs, the association formulated measures for the preparation of Overseas Chinese affairs after the war three years ago. In the spring of the thirty-second year, it set up an agency and invited 45 representatives from relevant agencies to participate. It held more than a dozen general meetings and countless small meetings. Various plans were compiled into two special volumes, which can be said to be all-inclusive, and they were sent to the Central Design Bureau and the Executive Yuan several months before the victory last year. A part of the post-war reconstruction plan has been approved in August this year, but the reconstruction funds have not yet been settled, not to mention the settlement of foreign exchange. The broken families, schools, shops, and fields of Overseas Chinese compatriots have no funds for relief, and the teachers who were sent to die in foreign countries have no money for compensation. The people who were sent out alive are wandering in foreign countries and waiting to be fed, and the wartime salaries owed to them cannot be paid. What kind of system is this? Is it worthy of talking about competing with others? It should be known that the revolution was successfully carried out from overseas, and others are also copying old articles. Have we awakened?</p>
<p>We have inquired about the numbers of the Overseas Chinese affairs budget from all aspects, which is really unbelievable, but the ruthless iron-like facts are in front of us: the Overseas Chinese affairs budget is so pitifully small, and the Overseas Chinese affairs are so urgently needed to be done! At present, the business expenses are only 5 million, accounting for 0.26% of the association's total expenses. What kind of calculation is this? Are there many people handling Overseas Chinese affairs? Not necessarily. The staff of a major association of the central government is only 70. Sometimes there is a section chief but no section head, and sometimes there is a section member but no section chief. It is conceivable that the person in charge is repairing the house with vines. The Overseas Chinese affairs that the Kuomintang General Assembly resolution and the Chairman’s order to be handled were written off by the president’s secretary and others who did not know it. The power of the accountant is really too great!</p>
<p>National expenditures have progressed from the rulers’ personal whims to public expenditures to increase public welfare. The difference is that the former is based on people’s discretion, while the latter is based on expenditure for income. The effect of national expenditures is either productive or non-productive. Productive expenditures have beneficial effects on social economy or people’s welfare. Non-productive expenditures do not benefit the economic effects and are waste. The Overseas Chinese affairs budget is obviously a productive expenditure, and it is the most effective investment. Today’s investment of one penny can get ten or twenty pennies tomorrow, for example, awarding Overseas Chinese students to return to China for further study. The motherland gives him 4,500 yuan in scholarships, but the Overseas Chinese remittances he brings are more than this number?</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is a national agency and a part of the country. It is used to express the personality of the country. The national personality is expressed through the agency. The quality of the agency’s performance has many reasons, but whether the budget is properly allocated is a major reason. Now that an agency has been set up to handle Overseas Chinese affairs, and people have been employed, but only 5 million of business is being done. We believe that no matter how skilled you are, you can’t do anything big. Wouldn’t it be a pity to spend 30 million of regular expenses and living subsidies? Wouldn’t it have a big impact on the expression of national personality?</p>
<p>Frederic W. Taylor first created "scientific management", which has now formed "the science of management", the purpose is nothing more than to increase efficiency. We hope that the government will improve the budget review system, and not allow people who only see money and don’t understand things to control the power of life and death. The budget of tens of millions should be discussed carefully, and the budget of several thousand should not be too harsh! A month of mobilization costs hundreds of millions of dollars; a school with less than 100 students moved from Yunnan to Chongqing, and from Chongqing to Beijing, costing more than tens of millions of dollars. In this case, why should the country be stingy with some Overseas Chinese business expenses? Guan Zi said: "Gold and knife coins are the common tools of the people, so the good ones hold their common tools to control their fate, so the people's strength can be exhausted." I hope the authorities will think about it and think about it again!</p>

<h3>Grain Tax in Zhejiang Province's Deficient Areas Approved for Payment in Coarse Rice or Cash; Fishing Escort Decided to Form Fishermen's Self-Defense Force</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 25th] Due to rice germination this autumn in Zhejiang Province, resulting in poor harvests, farmers are crying out in distress. Yesterday, the Provincial Government Committee resolved and approved that deficient areas be allowed to pay 72.2 catties of coarse rice per picul of rice husk or, if necessary, legal currency. At the same time, it was resolved to comply with the telegram from the Ministry of Food, and the field tax for the 35th year of the Republic of China in Zhejiang will be collected at a 50% discount, totaling 10.5 million yuan, with three dou of solid grain collected per yuan, totaling 3.15 million shi; one dou of borrowed grain, totaling 1.05 million shi; and 30% for public sale, 945,000 shi, for a total of more than 5 million shi. As for the field tax due in each county, it was resolved that the province would not centrally coordinate it. For business tax, 30% to 50% will be collected from Hangzhou City, Hangzhou County, Shaoxing, Yin County, Jiaxing, Hai’ning, Wuxing, Yongjia, Pinghu, Yuyao, Fenghua, Jiashan, Jinhua, Huangyan, Yang’an, Wenling, Pingyang and other counties for provincial coordination to subsidize poorer counties. The 14 counties of Sanmen Pan’an should be financially self-sufficient and will not be extracted from or subsidized.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Hangzhou] Regarding the matters that should be reformed in Zhejiang Province's fishing industry, after Li Anzheng of the Construction Department convened representatives from the Fisheries Administration Bureau, the Aquatic Products Company, and relevant fishing industry personnel in Dinghai to hold a symposium, the proposed plan was submitted to Chairman Shen for separate decisions, and the province will actively promote its gradual implementation. The main contents of the plan are roughly as follows: (1) In terms of escort, due to the vast fishing area and the limited strength of the water police, it is difficult to provide complete protection. It has been decided to organize a fishermen's self-defense force, adopting a method of government supervision and private operation. The government is responsible for allocating team members and salaries, and the Fishermen's Association is responsible for handling it. (2) Negotiate with the Farmers Bank of China to increase the province's fishing loan quota to a minimum of 1 billion yuan. The Provincial Bank will establish a fishing loan department to implement low-interest loans. The Provincial Government will negotiate with the Ministry of Finance to allow the province to establish a fishing bank. Loan departments will be attached to fish markets. (3) The Fisheries Bureau will mobilize various places to organize fish markets. The Dinghai Cold Storage should be allocated funds for repair as soon as possible. The Shenjiamen Cold Storage should be quickly received and reorganized. The Ningbo Fish Market will initiate the organization of cooperative ice head factories by fishermen in various places to engage in improved fish product manufacturing to facilitate sales.</p>
<h3>Suzhou High Court Held Court Yesterday; Public Trial of Traitor Shen Jinghua; A Set of Evasive Arguments; Crimes Obscured</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Suzhou, 25th] The Suzhou High Court held its first joint trial of traitor Shen Jinghua on the 25th, and the situation was no less than the public trial of major traitors such as Chen Chu. Approximately 200 people were in court to listen, and the audience on the side of the High Court Road was even more crowded. At 1:00 PM, Judge Chu Changhong of the Criminal Court signed an arrest warrant and brought the traitor Shen out of the prison for questioning in the waiting room. The traitor Shen made wild statements, saying that his role as a puppet county magistrate was to seek welfare for the people in the occupied area, and that he had no soldiers under his command and could not harm the people, etc. Those who heard it could not help but laugh, and some sneered at him. At 2:45 PM, Judge Chu took his seat. The First Court first questioned Wang Shubao, who was also accused in the same case. He claimed that he did not know Shen Jinghua and was operating a department store in Kunshan and had not served as a secret agent for the enemy. After questioning for about 20 minutes, the court ordered him to be sent back to custody. Next, traitor Shen was brought into the court and first questioned about his experience of collaborating with the enemy. According to his confession, he served as the director of the Qingpu Jiading Public Security Bureau before the war and as the director of the First District of the Taihu Water Police during the war. When the National Army retreated to the west, he retreated to Dongshan to engage in guerrilla warfare. In November of the 29th year, he was arrested and surrendered to the puppets, and was appointed by Li Shiqun as a commissioner of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, but he never reported to duty. Later, he was appointed as the county magistrate of Taicang, Wuxian, Jiading and other counties, and then officially took over the job. Judge Chu immediately questioned him why he took over the job: Traitor Shen answered shamelessly, claiming that he was acting on the orders of the central government, and refused to admit the puppet positions of Kunshan County Magistrate and Shanghai First District District Chief. He then denied the crimes of luring and killing patriot Yang Zhong, etc. After about 50 minutes of questioning, the court ordered him to be sent back to custody. During the trial, the photographers wanted to capture the expression on the face of the traitor Shen. The traitor Shen covered his face with the dossier and asked the court to stop it. After leaving the court, he covered his face with his left sleeve and walked quickly, escorted back to the prison. When passing through the court gate, he shouted loudly to the surrounding crowd that he was not a traitor, causing a burst of laughter. The ugly state of the traitor trying to cover up his crimes was completely exposed.</p>
<h3>Wuxing Stores Grain to Prevent Famine; County Council Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Wuxing] County Magistrate Yuan, considering that it is now the autumn harvest, and the fields that have not been flooded are being harvested one after another, the price of rice will inevitably fall, and farmers will sell at low prices. Rice merchants from neighboring counties will inevitably come to the county to compete for purchases, which is very important for the people's food. Therefore, a civil food adjustment committee was specially formed. The county government negotiated with various banks to provide low-interest loans to grain merchants to purchase and store large quantities of grain, waiting for the time when the green and yellow are not connected next year to distribute them at the price to help the people's food.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Wuxing] The Second Congress of the First Session of the Wuxing County Council was held for three days starting on the 20th.

(2) Organizing a civil food adjustment committee. (3) Strengthening health institutions and planning to establish public hospitals. (4) Merging the townships and towns in this county. (5) The flood in this county is very serious, requesting the reduction and exemption of the field tax for this year to relieve the people's difficulties. (6) Really build dikes and embankments and dredge rivers to benefit farmland and facilitate transportation.</p>

<h3>Building a New Village by the Lakeside</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Youth League Initiates Project to Help Solve Housing Shortage</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] The First Branch of the Hangzhou Youth League, in order to solve the housing problems of ordinary citizens and public school employees, has initiated the formation of the Hangzhou Youth Housing Cooperative. It is preparing to build a "Youth New Village" on vacant land such as the City Government foundation in front of Wang Temple on the Broken Bridge to Autumn Moon in the West Lake and Huansha Road line.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent] Sun Xun, a major traitor who once served as the Major General Director of the puppet Political Security Bureau Jiangsu Provincial Branch and other positions, surrendered himself to the Suzhou High Prosecutors Office the day before yesterday. After Prosecutor Zhang interrogated him, he was temporarily released on bail with guarantees from two substantial shops, pending further summons. During the Anti-Japanese War, Sun was a notorious running dog of the enemy in the occupied areas. While serving as the Chief of the Intelligence Section of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Experimental District and the Chief of the Investigation Office of the Puppet Tax Investigation Department, he specialized in gathering information on our Central military and political affairs, providing it to the enemy and puppets, and undermining our anti-Japanese work. When he served as the Chief of the Suzhou Branch of the Puppet Food Bureau, he controlled civilian food supplies in order to achieve the enemy's cunning plan of using war to support war. He also served as the Director and Education Chief of the Puppet Wuxi Rural Pacification Cadre Training Center, creating enemy and puppet henchmen and acting as an accomplice. Finally, while serving as the Director of the Puppet Political Security Bureau Jiangsu Provincial Branch, he extensively collected information on our side, arrested our underground workers, and murdered patriotic fighters in order to destroy our anti-Japanese vitality and curry favor with the enemy. He also used despicable means to detain innocent people, extort and blackmail them, and exhaust all his plundering abilities, with countless victims. After the victory, he was once detained by a certain military organization stationed in Suzhou. Due to careless supervision, he took advantage of the opportunity to escape from prison. He was recaptured by a certain security agency in mid-March of this year. Because the traitor was despicable and shameless and begged for mercy, he was released on bail again and fled without a trace. An arrest warrant was issued, and the guarantors were detained for two months. Recently, the traitor, seeing that detectives were everywhere, had no choice but to surrender himself to the Suzhou High Prosecutors Office, hoping to mitigate his punishment. However, the local Association of Comrades in Distress believes that the traitor's crimes are heinous, and many comrades in distress have suffered from his actions. Even the death penalty would not be excessive. They are currently collecting evidence of the traitor's crimes and will list his crimes in detail within a few days in order to send a letter to the judicial authorities requesting strict punishment according to the law.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou City Government Expands Organization</h3>

It is heard that the Municipal Government will refer to the proposal previously approved by the Provincial Government and redraft it.</p>
<h3>Quantity Short and Quality Changed: Confiscated Opium Reveals Corruption</h3>
<p>[Our Jiaxing Correspondent] The County Health Institute held a meeting yesterday to identify the composition of opium. The examination revealed that the seventeen taels of opium in the Fang Xiuzhen and Fang Xiuying's case of helping to sell opium, which was transferred by the Central District Police Precinct on March 17 to the County Military Law Office, has been reduced to fourteen and a half taels. Among them, eight taels contained more than 30% opium content, while six and a half taels contained no opium content at all, resembling sugar. There is suspicion of substitution. In addition, fifteen packs in the fifteen cases of Qian San et al. weighed one tael including the paper after examination. Three-tenths of the weight was opium. The identified opium was sealed and stamped by representatives of various legal entities present. Subsequently, Councilor Wang urgently proposed this peculiar incident at the council meeting, which shocked the audience. Councilors Ding Ningping, Wang Wenshen, Wu Dixiang, and Zheng Zhixia were immediately appointed to go to the Military Law Office to investigate the truth. Trial Officer Shen Xiaoda attended the meeting to report the process. The case was handled by former military judge Zhou Fengqi. He arrived at his post on May 2nd, and the handover was only in writing. The opium was stored in the General Affairs Office. Now the director of the General Affairs Office has left his post. Legally speaking, the police station, the General Affairs Office, the clerk, and the former military judge are all related. Finally, the council meeting advocated that the government should handle the case.</p>

<h3>Chaoxian Coal Mine Forcibly Occupied; Investigation Team Sends Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate Mine</h3>
<p>[Our Wuhu Correspondent, 25th] After the Chaoxian Coal Mine was taken over by the former Tenth War Zone, it was operated by the receivers, who mined coal for profit and refused to hand it over. Ma Jingdang of the investigation team has now consulted with Zhang Weilian, special commissioner of the Wuhu district, and the Third Security Regiment to send personnel to the mine today for a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>[Our Wuhu Correspondent] The Third Group of the investigation team has started work in Wuhu and is still in the investigation stage. Because the materials in the custody of the responsible persons of various agencies have not been handed over in accordance with the law, the group specifically notified them to submit the facts and the amount of losses as soon as possible, otherwise, the original sealers will be detained and fined. Also, at the beginning of the recovery, someone learned that there were a large number of deposited ornaments in the Catholic Church in the city. The ornaments were forcibly searched and taken away. Father Goegebeur recently sent a letter to the investigation team, stating that the receiving agencies used the excuse that there were traitors such as Cai Bingmei inside, so they moved all the miscellaneous items deposited in the church together with those not owned by traitors, and said, "The things of traitors are not to be collected, and the things that are not traitors are also traitors when they are put together." A large gold bar, two small gold bricks, and 167 silver dollars belonging to Goegebeur were taken away. Three gold rings belonging to Li Hai. 500,000 yuan in legal tender. Two gold rings belonging to Teacher Jiang of the Catholic Church Primary School. A gold necklace and ten gold rings belonging to Zheng Deshun. Four gold bracelets, a gold anklet, a gold chain, seven gold rings, and two small gold coins belonging to Zheng Yufa. A gold lock, ten gold rings, 42.25 million yuan in legal tender, a gold watch, a gold chain, and five pairs of gold earrings belonging to Zhang Songting. There was also a safe, the contents of which, and the number of gold ornaments stored inside were unknown, as well as a large package containing many valuable leather garments, etc. After receiving the report, Team Leader Ma Jingchang was very angry and will strictly investigate the matter. The city party headquarters also notified the citizens to report any clues.</p>
<h3>Increasing Production of Wanxi Green Tea; Organizing Abandoned Gardens and Inferior Trees</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Correspondent] Wanxi green tea, which is famous at home and abroad, is produced in the three counties of Liu'an, Huoshan, and Lihuang in Anhui Province. It is called Xishan tea, which is excellent in color, taste, and aroma, with Subu Qitou Mountain being the best. The tea produced in the four counties of Shucheng, Lujiang, Yuexi, and Taihu is called Nanshan tea, which is second best. Before the sixth year of the Republic of China, the above seven counties produced 300,000 to 400,000 dan of tea annually. Later, Xishan was occupied by the Communist army, and during the war, it was blockaded by the Japanese invaders. There was no way to sell the tea, and the price plummeted. Tea gardens were abandoned, and the mountains were full of them. Although the Huoshan Tea Improvement Factory of the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry tried its best to guide and support the development, and the Tea Lending and Marketing Office purchased and sold tea every year, the production last year was less than 40,000 dan. Now, in order to relieve tea farmers and increase production, the Relief Administration has decided to reorganize the tea gardens in the above seven counties. According to statistics, there are currently 320,000 mu of tea gardens, with a total of 64 million tea trees and 600,000 tea farmers. Therefore, a four-year plan has been formulated to remove weeds and open up abandoned tea gardens, and to prune or transplant existing tea trees, to be completed in four years. This winter, 16 million tea trees will be reorganized first. It is estimated that the tea production can be increased by 30,000 dan next spring.</p>
<h3>Qidong Intercepts Materials; Returns or Confiscates Them Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Nanbao Correspondent] Regarding the suspicious materials intercepted by the various units in the first (September 28th) and second (October 8th) surprise raids at various ports in this county, the materials included an astonishing amount of floral cloth, broad beans, white paper, collar hooks, military uniform buttons, alcohol, pigs, sheep, sugar, and cigarettes. In order to thoroughly investigate, the county government dispatched Police Officer Liu Fucheng to cooperate with the county party headquarters and the district heads of the first to fifth districts to be responsible for the handling. After several days of separate investigations and summoning the owners of the materials one by one, the results have been obtained. All the materials belonging to legitimate merchants will be returned to the owners who come to claim them with proof of ownership. If the owners have gone elsewhere and no one comes to claim them, they will be temporarily sealed up in the county government and kept for future investigation and return. As for those that are found to be smuggled goods after investigation, they will be confiscated and reported to higher authorities for disposal by the county government.</p>

<p>Prevent Fires, Please Remove Board Houses</p>
<p>We live in Lane 302, near Haifang Road and Jiangning Road in western Shanghai. There are more than eight lanes in total, with nearly a thousand households. During the Shanghai War in 1937, residents of Zhabei fled to the concessions. At that time, the lanes were occupied by refugees. Because of traffic congestion, in order to facilitate the management of the lanes, temporary permission was given to build board houses in the back lanes. For eight years, the number of houses and people in that area has increased. The lane connects Haifang Sea in the front and Jiangning Road and Anyuan Road in the back. Therefore, the lane is blocked, forming a situation where water cannot flow through. Because Lanes 153 and the Western Lane experienced fires on the 5th and 8th of last month, residents fled with their belongings, but there was no way to escape. They were all screaming and crying. Fortunately, the fires were extinguished quickly, preventing a disaster. Otherwise, it would have been unimaginable! Moreover, as the weather is approaching late autumn and winter, and the weather is dry, in order to prevent disasters, we respectfully request the authorities to move or demolish the board houses to ensure the safety of the citizens in the lanes. We are praying for your urgent attention. (From all the lane heads)</p>
<p>Yangzhou Hospital Clarifies Clinic Services</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Hu Fenghao's criticism of the clinic services of Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou Hospital, the hospital sent a letter stating: "Since this hospital was ordered to prepare for establishment in June of this year, it has always considered that there were many refugees in Yangzhou and that epidemics were expected during the summer. Therefore, it started outpatient services on July 11, providing free medical treatment specifically for refugees. Since the opening of the clinic until now, 22,000 refugees have been treated, and all have medical records. During this time, there were many refugees who required surgery, but the hospital was newly established and had a limited number of doctors. Therefore, it was changed to provide medical treatment for refugees on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons and surgery for refugees on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday afternoons, temporarily suspending outpatient services. However, after a doctor's diagnosis, those who were deemed to require daily treatment could still come for daily treatment without interruption. As for refugees with mild symptoms, although they were treated every other day, they were also given enough medicine to last for two days. Since the implementation, refugees with illnesses have not felt any inconvenience. Recently, as the number of serious illnesses requiring surgery has gradually decreased, the hospital resumed the time for providing medical treatment specifically for refugees every afternoon starting on October 1st. How could this hospital be acting contrary to government orders? I am deeply afraid that the outside world will not know the facts and will be confused. Therefore, I dare not remain silent and ask that you publish this to clarify the truth."</p>
<p>There Are No Streetlights on the Side of the Stinking Stream</p>
<p>In Jinjia Lane at the end of Xinzha Road, there is a stinking stream. During the summer, the stream water emits a foul odor under the sun, and passersby hold their breath. Now that the weather has cooled down, it is very inconvenient for passersby because there are no streetlights. It is common for pedestrians and rickshaws to accidentally fall into the stream at night. In addition to pedestrians being more cautious, please pay attention to the Public Works Bureau to find a way to install one or two streetlights. (Fang Jinchang)</p>
<p>The Location of the "Central Education District"</p>
<p>Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Municipal Education Bureau plans to establish secondary education districts in the four suburbs of the city and will first establish the West Suburban Secondary Education District at Hongqiao Airport, which I found very exciting. However, Hongqiao Airport was the first airport built in the city and was the location of the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War. It seems necessary to preserve it as a memorial. As for public land for building schools in western Shanghai, the citizens of this city should not forget the "Zhongzheng Camp," the location where college and high school students in this city concentrated for military training before the war. The land is located west of Huacao Town on the North Dike Road. At that time, more than 360 mu of farmland were requisitioned. It is currently abandoned and has not been received and used by the government. I am writing this letter to urge the attention of the educational administrative authorities.

<p>Road Names and House Numbers are Being Corrected</p>
<p>I read the article "Properly Determine Road Names and House Numbers in the City" in the Reader Opinions column of your newspaper on October 22. The regulations on road names and the installation of road signs are the responsibility of the Public Works Bureau. This bureau is responsible for organizing house numbers, which is being carried out in accordance with the "Shanghai Municipal Regulations on Organizing House Numbers" passed by the 25th Municipal Government Meeting. The preliminary investigation has been completed. We are now renovating inverted door numbers, pasting temporary door number lane numbers, and supplementing new signs. The irrational phenomena of having two colors of door number plates on one road and other unreasonable phenomena will soon be corrected. We respectfully request that you publish this information to inform the public. (Shanghai Municipal Police Department)</p>

<h3>Various Small Nations Challenge the Soviet Union: Unanimously Oppose the Veto Power; U.S. Advocates Free Discussion of All Issues; Eight Assistant Secretaries-General Were Sworn in Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: The Soviet delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly attempted to prevent the General Assembly from discussing the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council. However, due to the firm opposition of the United States, their efforts are bound to fail. The General Committee, composed of representatives from fourteen countries, will discuss the agenda. Currently, there are fifty-three items tentatively scheduled, three of which relate to the veto power. Australia proposes limiting the veto power of the five permanent members, while Cuba has put forward two proposals advocating the complete abolition of the veto power clause in the Charter. Soviet representative Vyshinsky insisted that the veto power issue should not be discussed, while the United States believes that any issue should have the right to be fully discussed in the General Assembly. With both sides unwilling to concede, a heated debate is inevitable. However, the Soviet Union's position has little hope of being fully accepted.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 25th] After a heated debate last night regarding the treatment of Indians in South Africa, the General Committee of the General Assembly has only two remaining proposals on the provisional agenda that are likely to cause heated debate: Cuba's motion to abolish the veto power and Australia's motion to amend the entire Charter. These two matters will be discussed at this afternoon's meeting. At the same time, the Plenary Session is also scheduled to continue the general debate this afternoon. Last night, during the debate on the South Africa-India issue, Soviet representative Vyshinsky and Ukrainian representative Manuilsky supported the Indian representative and opposed South African Prime Minister Smuts' proposal to withdraw the "Treatment of Indians in the Union of South Africa" issue from the provisional agenda. The committee finally recommended that the General Assembly refer the matter to the Legal and Political Committees for discussion. The United Kingdom and the United States are expected to oppose the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw the item on the agenda discussing the veto power of the five permanent members. The U.S. representative will also oppose the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw the discussion of South Africa's annexation of Southwest Africa. If the General Committee refuses to accept Cuba's proposal to convene a special committee to discuss the abolition of the veto power, the Cuban delegation may withdraw from the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Comprehensive News] The United Nations General Assembly held its first meeting on the evening of the 24th. After Secretary-General Lie reported on the work of the secretariat, the chief representative of Brazil, Najera, launched a general debate, requesting the abolition or modification of the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council, arguing that the veto power hinders the unity of the United Nations. Representatives from the Philippines and Cuba also declared their opposition to the veto power. Cuban representative Freyre issued a final challenge to the Soviet Union today. Mr. Freyre put forward two proposals requesting the revision of the United Nations Charter to abolish the veto power of the five permanent members, hoping to include this proposal on the agenda. Mr. Freyre also declared to reporters that democratic countries constitute a majority in the United Nations General Assembly, and if we cannot freely express our opinions and freely discuss matters, what is the use of the General Assembly? Brazilian representative Velloso also fiercely opposed the abuse of the veto power in the Security Council. It is said that "If it is said that sacrificing the welfare of mankind is legitimate when the interests of great powers conflict, the whole world will never think that way. The reason why the countries at the San Francisco Conference agreed to grant the four powers the veto power was because they were single-mindedly focused on maintaining peace, and thus granted certain privileges to the major powers, but these countries must not lose faith in order to do so." The Peruvian representative echoed the Brazilian proposal, stating that if the veto power is abused, it will inevitably revert to the Middle Ages, and most countries will have no opportunity to seek justice. The Belgian representative, Langehove, stated that the mission of the Security Council is to maintain peace, but the Council has not yet studied issues that could endanger peace. I also believe that all the failures of the Security Council are due to the abuse of the veto power by a certain permanent member. The Soviet Union remained silent in the face of the initial barrage of criticism, but its attitude was very firm.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 24th Special Dispatch] The Second Plenary Session of the United Nations General Assembly was held this morning, and eight Assistant Secretaries-General were officially sworn in. At the request of the President of the General Assembly, Spaak, Wellington Koo took a seat on the high platform adorned with the famous world map. Subsequently, Secretary-General Lie introduced the following eight Assistant Secretaries-General: Soviet representative Sobolev, responsible for the work of the Security Council; British representative Owen, responsible for economic work; French representative Laugier, responsible for social work; Chinese representative Hu Shih-tse, responsible for trusteeship work; Chilean representative Cohen, responsible for information work; Czech representative Kerno, responsible for legal work; Dutch representative Feller, responsible for conference and general services; and U.S. representative Hassen, responsible for administrative and financial affairs. Each person read a brief statement pledging allegiance to the work of the United Nations, stating, "In the performance of my duties, I will not seek or accept instructions from any government or any source external to the United Nations." Hu Shih-tse used Chinese when taking the oath.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Reports on Secretariat Affairs: Requests Action Against Franco; Spanish Embassy in the United States Denounces as Unreasonable Slander</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly convened at 4:15 PM today. The agenda for today included the appointment of eight Assistant Secretaries-General, the presentation of credentials by the representatives, the report of the election of the chairmen of the three committees, the acceptance of Secretary-General Lie's report, and then the commencement of the general debate. Lie's report stated: I cannot but urge the General Assembly to pay attention to the issue of the new regime in Spain. The Security Council should also study this issue in detail, some of which involve matters that have been discussed by the Economic and Social Council. Other organizations within the United Nations system may also be affected by the Spanish issue. After the defeat of Germany and Japan, the fact that fascist forces still hold control in Spain is truly unpleasant. The continued existence of the Franco regime will be a cause of misunderstanding among the countries that founded the United Nations. Therefore, I hope that those who once brought us victory and peace can also find ways to restore freedom and democratic government to Spain. Lie then described the progress of the work of the Atomic Energy Commission, stating that this progress is extremely limited and slow. Until this major issue is resolved, the world cannot sleep peacefully. This is the responsibility of the United Nations system. Regarding the status of the United Nations system in international law, Lie stated that the Nuremberg trials have created a precedent. For the sake of protecting peace and humanity, the principles that can be used in the Nuremberg trials should be made permanent provisions in international law as soon as possible. Lie continued to say that since the end of the war, the United Nations has been divided in opinion due to peace. The United Nations Charter is based on a proper peace and the firm agreement of the powers. The conclusion of peace treaties can provide the United Nations system with a solid working foundation and eliminate many confusing opinions that hinder the progress of work, allowing it to focus on ensuring a stable peace and promoting the welfare of the people. If we cannot understand this great ultimate goal, the whole world will not forgive us. Lie also reiterated the issue of human rights, stating that the protection of human rights is stipulated in the Charter. Unfortunately, many countries, even the most progressive ones, cannot ensure that all their people have basic human rights. Therefore, we must not stop striving until women in all parts of the world can enjoy the same rights as men.

We feel that there will come a day" when the secret of Lie's attitude will be known, and we believe that there is indeed such a secret. Otherwise, Lie, having no knowledge of Spain and having no connection with the so-called "Spanish issue," would not dare to make such unreasonable slander. ...If the Secretary-General of the United Nations attempts to spread a thick smokescreen for the special interests of some of his friends, ...we believe that this move will not succeed.</p>

The head of the South African delegation, namely the country's Prime Minister Smuts, believed that this matter was purely a domestic issue and should not be included on the agenda of the General Assembly. However, the President of the General Assembly, Spaak, declared that the General Committee has no right to remove any issue from the agenda, but the General Assembly has the right to decide on it. Soviet representative Vyshinsky, with the support of the majority of representatives, stated that the General Assembly should review this issue, and the South African motion was withdrawn.

<h3>Churchill Responds to Attlee: Sternly Condemns the Communist Party; Says It is Enough to Destroy Good Social Systems</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Luton, England, 24th] Churchill delivered a speech here tonight, responding to Prime Minister Attlee's address at the Trades Union Congress attacking British Communism. Churchill said that the British government's break with the Communist Party has important and beneficial results for foreign countries, because some countries in Europe, such as France, are now struggling under the attack of Communism. This position of the British government can promote the stability of Europe and serve as a model for many countries. Churchill then reiterated the serious warning he issued in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that he had given serious consideration to the question of whether there were more than two hundred divisions of Soviet troops stationed throughout Europe before raising it. The facts that can be revealed have evidence to prove their correctness. Churchill also said that the words used by Stalin a few months ago to scold Churchill were commonly used by Hitler or Goebbels. Churchill continued to say that the British Communist Party is currently not enough to become a major political target, so it is still not worthy of national attention. However, communist ideas in France are growing terribly. The revival of French life has been threatened by it. Under any communist government, the communist system is a totalitarian system, enough to destroy freedom and a good social system. Greece, after fair and free citizen elections, has jumped out of the danger of the communist Balkan bloc. After criticizing the government's domestic policies, Churchill said that Attlee's ability to use such language to condemn communist propaganda is in line with my intentions. I feel that our country has not been affected by communist propaganda.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Former Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the Soviet Union has more than two hundred divisions of troops stationed in Europe. According to a cable from the "London Times" correspondent in Moscow, foreign military experts believe that the figures put forward by Churchill are exaggerated.</p>

Today's Trades Union Congress passed a resolution by a majority demanding that the British government sever all economic and diplomatic relations with the Franco government. At the same time, a resolution criticizing the British government's foreign policy towards Spain, Greece, Germany, and the Soviet Union was rejected.</p>

<h3>Pravda Criticizes: Soviet Communist Party; Neglects Democratic Principles</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] Pravda criticized today that the Soviet Communist Party seriously neglects democratic principles.

<h3>Explaining the Reasons for the Quarrel between the U.S. and Philippine Military and Civilians: MacArthur Issued a Statement Yesterday; Philippine Newspapers Criticize the Behavior of the U.S. Military</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur issued a statement today on the current situation in the Philippines, stating: Since the independence of the Philippines in June, the commander of the U.S. forces in the Philippines reported that the solid camaraderie that existed during the U.S.-Philippine war has declined. The irresponsibility of some new U.S. soldiers, commercial plundering, the recovery of war disasters, the rights of demobilized soldiers, and relief issues are some of the reasons for this sentiment. However, the root cause is even deeper. Most Filipinos, even if they have friendly intentions, feel uneasy about foreign troops stationed in their capital, Manila, and as a result, the situation has become enormous. MacArthur also answered a question about "What is the morale of the U.S. forces stationed in Japan?": The Japanese occupation forces under my direct command are understaffed and lack combat training. However, apart from natural homesickness, the morale and discipline can be said to be excellent. I can no longer ask for anything more.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 25th] After U.S. Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower ordered an investigation into the discipline of U.S. troops in the Philippines, Philippine newspapers criticized the behavior of the U.S. military.

<h3>Director of the Bureau of Conscription Holds Press Conference in Nanjing: Confirms Delay in Implementation of Conscription in Shanghai, States that This Conscription is Only to Fill Vacancies; Cultural and Technical Workers May Be Temporarily Exempt from Call-Up</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] When answering questions from reporters on the 25th, Xu Siping, Director of the Bureau of Conscription, confirmed that the implementation of conscription in Shanghai will be postponed. He also stated that technical and cultural workers may be temporarily exempt from call-up, and shop managers, etc., will not be used as ordinary soldiers when they enlist in the future. Instead, they will be assigned to work in military logistics, so that their own expertise will not be completely buried. It is said that the authorities are treating the implementation of conscription in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Chongqing very seriously. Because the population in these three cities is relatively large, the implementation will naturally be more difficult than in other places. Therefore, conscription is specifically delayed. At the same time, the personnel institutions, laws, and investigations related to conscription in the above locations are also being handled with special care, and the household registration survey work is limited to being completed within this year. In terms of the principle of the Conscription Law: conscription is universal. However, the current call-up is only to fill vacancies. Its purpose is only to supplement the vacancies of a small number of discharged or infirm soldiers in the military. It is only a call-up of "soldiers" and not a call-up of "officers," nor a supplement of military technical personnel. The date of the nationwide implementation of conscription has not been determined. The number of conscripts will be very small, even less than one-tenth or one-twentieth of that during wartime. The authorities attach great importance to the selection of the commander of the Shanghai and Nanjing-Chongqing Garrison Districts, and it is currently difficult to find a suitable candidate. Another senior conscription official also said that the Conscription Law is only a basic law, and more than 20 other laws related to conscription have not yet been drafted and promulgated, so the real implementation of conscription may have to wait. The authorities are considering the Shanghai municipal government's request to deliberate on delaying conscription in the area. Director Xu gave a detailed explanation of the characteristics of the new Conscription Law at the press conference today, and explained that this resumption of conscription is peacetime, not wartime. It is said that the target of conscription under the previous Conscription Law was "soldiers" and did not mention "officers." At the same time, due to limited national funding and poor soldier treatment, the general public tried to evade military service, resulting in various malpractices. The new Conscription Law adds military officers, military sergeants, and army, navy, and air force soldiers, expanding the scope of conscription. The state determines the needs of the people based on their quality. Those who study medicine can serve as medical officers, and those who study engineering can serve in bridge construction and road repair, so that talents are put to good use. At the same time, the scope of postponement of conscription has also been reduced compared to the past (previously there were more than 110 types), so that the obligation to serve is equally and universally applicable.</p>
<h3>Police and Bandits Clash Fiercely at the Intersection of Route Foch and Route Cardinal Mercier: All Five Robbers Captured, One Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Last night at 8:30, the Grand China Leather Shoe Store at 380 Route Foch and Route Cardinal Mercier had already closed when five violent bandits suddenly forced their way in, brandishing firearms and threatening the store staff. Two bandits went upstairs first and confined the tenants and the store owner's wife in one room. Then, they entered the bedroom of the store owner Zhou Dengrong's mother in the back room and forcibly snatched the gold ring from Zhou's mother's hand. At this time, passersby had noticed and urgently reported to the nearby New Town Police Station.</p>
<p>Director Zhuo Qingbao of the police station, accompanied by Criminal Section Chief Song Bingzheng, personally led 70-80 armed officers, divided into two police vehicles, to the scene. Because the pedestrians there were crowded and there were many people in the room, fearing that it would be difficult to distinguish right from wrong and harm the innocent, Director Zhuo ordered the officers to form a fan shape and surround the area. Section Chief Song first led the police to bravely rush in. At this time, the bandits in the room knew that they had been exposed. In order to preemptively strike, they fired dozens of shots in succession. The police immediately returned fire. One bandit, Shi Tingshan (29 years old, from Shaoxing), tried to break out of the encirclement and was captured first. The other two bandits downstairs engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the police and were eventually knocked down. These two bandits, named Chen Miaofu (20 years old, from Nantong) and Song Zhiyuan (21 years old, from Hangzhou), were also captured. At that time, the bandit Sheng Yipin (20 years old, from Shandong) upstairs was at a loss and was also arrested. Another accomplice, Zhang, committed suicide out of fear of punishment, shooting himself in the throat. He was still breathing weakly and was sent to the police hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The police and bandits held each other for four hours. At that time, the Municipal Police Bureau, upon receiving the report, also dispatched a large number of officers to the scene. At the same time, the Route Massenet Gendarmerie and the Investigation Division of the Garrison Command also dispatched personnel to assist. When bullets were flying, a pedestrian, Xu Wenhui (resident of 370 on the same road), was hit in the right cheek by a stray bullet, and another person, Zhang Heqing (resident of 372 nearby), was shot in the left arm. They were sent to Hongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

The resolution states that the intention of Item 1 of Resolution No. 16 of the Finance Department, which stated that the entertainment tax would restore the originally scheduled donation rate of 50%, did not state that it originally contained additional defense expenses. According to the principle of Resolution No. 1 of the Budget Department, the additional defense expenses will be abolished from the autumn of this year. The two industry associations' request to collect 41% of the entertainment tax is not without reason and should be requested by the Finance Bureau to refer to Resolution No. 16 of the Finance Department and Resolution No. 1 of the Budget Department of the first general meeting of the council, as well as the resolution of the second case of the 17th municipal administration meeting of the Municipal Government, for deliberation.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] The China Merchants Bureau yesterday took over the Jing'an Steamer transferred by the Naval Department.

The contract was divided into Chinese and English versions, and signed successively by Director Huo, Chennault, Willie Lea, and William Green. Thus, the UNRRA Civil Air Transport Team, which had suffered several setbacks, was officially established yesterday morning. After the signing ceremony, Director Huo and General Chennault shook hands happily, welcoming the Flying Tiger General, who had served China during the war, to join the UNRRA organization and serve the Chinese people again. Director Huo said to Chen: "I welcome you to join our big family." Chen told reporters that he was honored to be able to serve the Chinese people. The transport work of the air transport team will officially begin in mid-next month, with Guangzhou as the main transport station, distributing relief supplies to various parts of South China. The air transport team will consist of 12 transport aircraft supplied by the UNRRA, three of which will arrive in Shanghai recently. As soon as the three aircraft arrive, work will begin.</p>
<h3>Term of Work is the Same as the UNRRA; Profits and Losses are Solely the Responsibility of Chen</h3>
<p>The summary of the contract is as follows: all 12 aircraft supplied by the UNRRA are C-46 and C-47 transport aircraft, purchased with funds raised by the UNRRA, with a total value of US$2 million. The UNRRA will also allocate US$1 million in foreign exchange as the salaries of the air transport team's staff and the cost of purchasing various fuels and supplies. In addition, Chennault and Willie Lea will jointly raise US$1 million to make up for the shortfall. Chen and Lea are fully responsible for the profits and losses of the air transport team. The work of the air transport team is stipulated to transport the UNRRA's relief supplies. The aircraft are absolutely prohibited from transporting goods and passengers when traveling between coastal cities or from coastal cities to the interior. The nature of the air transport team is exactly the same as that of the UNRRA's water transport team and land transport team. However, on the return trip from the interior to the coastal cities, if there is spare tonnage, government personnel may be transported. If there are still empty seats, passengers can also be carried, and the prices will be the same as those of the China Central Airlines. The term of work is equal to the term of work of the UNRRA. As soon as the UNRRA ends, the air transport team will also end. After the air transport team ends, all aircraft and equipment will belong to Chen and his assistants, but they must repay the funds for the aircraft and equipment on a monthly basis within 18 months. The air transport team will transport materials on behalf of the UNRRA at a cost of US$0.9 per ton (per mile). The area covered includes the seven major cities of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Hankou, Guilin, Hengyang, and Liuzhou. Other areas will be expanded as needed and as possible. All profits and losses are the sole responsibility of Chennault. Chen also discussed the application of airports and personnel issues in detail with Huo yesterday morning, and most of them have been resolved. The UNRRA is scheduled to end next autumn, and the work of the air transport team will also end at that time. After the work begins, all principles will be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the contract.</p>
<h3>Robbers Who Held Up Cars Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] At about 4:00 AM on the 23rd, three armed bandits held up six or seven pedicabs carrying meat vendors and other peddlers near the Beicao Zhen Highway on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. When each car passed by alone, they were stopped and taken to a thatched shed on the side of the road, where all their belongings were robbed. More than an hour later, the Putuo Road Police Station received a tip that the case was hidden to the right of the Chongxin Yarn Factory on Xiguangfu Road, so Chief Qi ordered staff member Zhang Lin, patrol officer Xu Senfu, police chief Zhao Yongji, Cai Sheng and others to rush to the address and arrested the bandit Liu Chunpeng on the spot, seizing a pistol and 90,000 yuan in legal tender. The other two accomplices are still at large.</p>

His mistress, Fan Jingfang, was also sentenced to three years in prison and three years of deprivation of civil rights for the crime of jointly colluding with the enemy. Fan Jingfang married Lu Xiangsheng, the former captain of the 4th Brigade of the Loyal Salvation Army Action Corps, as a concubine in April of the 33rd year of the Republic. Later, she became acquainted with Li Qiaolin (aka Li ZhengGu), an intelligence officer of the enemy's military police. On September 14 of the same year, Lu was captured by Li Qiaolin, who led the enemy's military police to Wan's residence at No. 7 Gengyu Lane, Rue Paul Beau. Fan was also arrested at the same time, but was released later. However, Lu Xiangsheng's whereabouts are still unknown. Later, Fan became acquainted with Wang Wei, a lieutenant platoon leader of the puppet security team, and robbed Lu Xiangsheng's grain from the Chen Yuanfeng Rice Mill on January 17 of the 34th year of the Republic. After the victory, Lu's wife, Wang Sanmei, and concubine, Zhao Yue'e, jointly reported that Fan and Wang had colluded with the enemy to frame Lu Xiangsheng.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent] Li Xingrong, originally from Korea, is a descendant of the royal family. He changed to Chinese nationality in the 15th year of the Republic. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Li changed his name to Masahara Haruo and came to Shanghai to open the Masahara Company, dealing in chemical products. After the victory, it was reported that he had purchased military supplies for the enemy military department and manufactured ammunition raw materials such as alcohol and mild steel. After the case was filed by the High Prosecutor's Office, several court sessions were held for investigation.

The case has been concluded and is scheduled to be pronounced on the 31st of this month.</p>
<p>Ge Weichang</p>
<p>Ge Weichang, a native of Suzhou, 47 years old, joined the puppet government in April of the 29th year of the Republic as the chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the puppet Central Political Committee. In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic, he also served as the acting chief of the General Affairs Office. In the summer of the 31st year of the Republic, he was transferred to serve as the director of the Managerial Office of the puppet Central Tax Police School. In October of the same year, he was transferred to Bengbu to serve as the director of the Salt Affairs Management Office of the puppet Ministry of Finance. He was arrested after the victory. At the trial in the High Court yesterday, he admitted to all the puppet positions he held and said that he was originally the manager of the Xindu Grand Theater in Nanjing and was introduced to join the puppet government by Luo Junqiang. The court ordered the case to be adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<p>Yan Qingxiang</p>
<p>Yan Qingxiang, General Manager of the Suzhou Sulun Yarn Factory, was suspected of being a traitor. The High Court yesterday summoned witnesses to investigate the part about providing textiles to the Enemy Sino-Japanese Trade Association. According to witnesses Wu Kunsheng, manager of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, Zheng Xiongceng, secretary of Yong'an Textile Company, Ma Timing, manager of Baofeng Yarn Factory, and Li Nailv, director of Sulun Yarn Factory, in the 33rd year of the Republic, the Japanese wanted to destroy the machines of the factories that were not operating and use them as military iron. Wen Lanting, chairman of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Yarn Factory Industry Association, negotiated with them and used the condition of weaving yarn and cloth for the "China Trade Association" as a condition to avoid destroying the machines. All members could not avoid it. Those with looms wove cloth, and those with spindles spun yarn. The quantity was determined according to the number of looms and spindles in each factory. The raw materials were supplied by them, and a small amount of wages was paid separately. The whole thing was compulsory, and no one actually wanted to do it.</p>
<p>In addition, the cases of Yang Qing, the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's 6th Detective Squad Leader, a follower of Lu Ying, and Fang Guojin, a businessman accused of providing metal to the enemy, were both investigated and adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Thirteen People Arrested One After Another for Selling Narcotics Along the Road</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Putuo Road Police Station received a tip in the morning before yesterday that someone was selling narcotics on the road, so it immediately ordered staff member Zhou Xueqin to lead the police to the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Anyuan Road, where they found Tong Guocai standing by the roadside and arrested him. They seized 22 small packets of white powder and 22,850 yuan in legal tender for selling narcotics from his side, and brought the witness to the station. According to the confession, the white powder was purchased from Yan Yongtian on the road, totaling 30 packets, at 3,000 yuan per packet. However, he only profited 500 yuan per packet when reselling it to others. He did this as a last resort because he was unemployed. Then, the police managed to arrest Yan and another female suspect, Zhu Jingfang. One after another, drug addicts such as Li Changdang and Li Caoshi were arrested in Xihua Lane and Meifang Lane in West Shanghai, totaling 13 men and women. They have already been reported to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.</p>

<h3>Irrational Compilation of Workers' Cost of Living Index · Various Trade Unions Request Improvement</h3>
<p>On the 19th of this month, in response to the request of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the municipal government sent Zhou Shishu from the research office to the federation to explain the compilation process of the workers' cost of living index. Representatives of various trade unions, believing that there were many discrepancies with the current situation, made the following suggestions to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: (1) The current cost of living index is based on a household survey conducted during the enemy occupation in 1942, which is different from the current living standards. A new household survey should be conducted as a basis. (2) Before the household survey is completed, during the transitional period, the three types of staple foods in the food category, namely corn, wheat bran, and soybeans, are inconsistent with real life and should be removed. The current standard for white rice is inferior rice. In order to ensure nutritional quality, the food category should be improved and the names of the food items should be based on the living standards surveyed by the Social Affairs Bureau in 1929 to meet the needs of actual life. (3) The prices of the surveyed goods should be carefully noted in the market. (4) The index should add the necessary expenses for children's education, medical care, and miscellaneous expenses. (5) The weights of necessities should be increased and made public. (6) The publication time should be changed to once every half month. (7) A cost of living index compilation committee should be organized by relevant parties, adopting an open approach, or reorganizing the existing cost of living index application committee, with representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors participating to ensure fairness. It is heard that the above recommendations have been resolved by the council of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and submitted to the municipal government for improvement and publication within the possible scope.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of Pickpocketing in Shanghai (6)</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>The "Running the Docks" gang spends its days wandering around the docks, with many eyes and ears. Some of the small employees on the ships often collude with these people in secret, actually sending secret codes in the guise of government spies, and can get a share after a successful extortion. This gang lives by this "toll line," and is naturally good at making connections and eating endlessly. Therefore, among the "old brothers" gangs, the "Running the Docks" gang should be the most promising, and its organization is the most strict and possesses a strong "spirit of self-government."</p>
<p>"Running the Garbage" - this gang is simply the scavengers under the "Running the Docks" gang. Those who engage in this are some of the more useless "bagasse" types. Those shops and businesses near the docks are all places they frequent. Mainly the seafood stores, fresh produce stores, fruit stores, food stores, etc. They steal things when people are not paying attention, regardless of value. They take what they steal and sell it. If they are caught in the act, they put on a pleading expression and perform the whole act of crying and laughing. As a result, they are beaten up and that's the end of it. Sometimes, the "uncles" come out to surround them, so naturally the matter can be reduced from a big deal to a small one.</p>
<p>"White Strips in the Waves" Are Skilled in Swimming</p>
<p>The "Water Rats" gang was originally also within the scope of the "Pickpocketing Party." The brothers in this gang are skilled in swimming. They are the "Turning River Rat" and "White Strips in the Waves" types of outlaws from the Water Margin. They usually make a living by rowing boats to fish or salvaging lost objects in the river, seemingly living a legitimate life, but secretly doing evil in the water and stealing at every opportunity. The gang's slang for "drilling the bottom" means sneaking into the ship's hold to steal, or "water surprise," which means lurking in the water to steal at every opportunity. There are many large and small ships regularly moored in the Huangpu River every day, and even the iron chains and anchors are often stolen by these water rats. Experienced boatmen, for safety's sake, usually pay tribute money to the "uncles" of the Water Rat gang every month. If they are unwilling to give it, the uncles order the water rats to cause a big ruckus, or cut off the iron anchor, or damage the bottom of the ship, causing them to lose a lot of money. This is a hidden rule. When calculated on a monthly basis, it is naturally quite considerable.</p>
<p>Street Bureau Station Someone Else Has Done a Good Deed</p>
<p>In the streets of Shanghai, various scams are often discovered. They use extremely simple methods to lure people into the trap. This is the trick played by the "Cut the Head Play" gang. "Cut the Head Play" is also a branch of the "Pickpocketing Party." Although they are not as actively involved in stealing money as the "Eat Bad Rice" gang, they use passive methods to lure passers-by's hard-earned money. On the surface, they are completely in a divine state. Their ability and spirit can be said to be another achievement, because those who operate are all old and cunning members of the gang, setting up a scam on the street and letting people fall for it.</p>
<p>There are many tricks in the "Cut the Head Play." Every time they go out on the street, they have a small group that works together, ranging from three or four people to more than a dozen. Currently, they are collectively called "Bridge Frames," which includes everything that is set up on the side of the road to make money by scamming. The following is a detailed description:</p>
<p>(1) "Facing the Sky Seal" - setting up a mahjong gambling stall on the side of the street to lure passers-by into the game in order to defraud them of money.</p>
<p>(2) "Leaves" - playing the leaf game of poker, luring passers-by to bet on guessing the old man's head on the card. With skillful techniques, they make it impossible for people to figure it out, and they can win in nineteen out of ten cases. But if a passer-by guesses correctly, they will start arguing and turn hostile, and will never let the bettor take advantage.</p>
<p>(3) "Chess Stall" - setting up a chess stall on the side of the road, arranging a stalemate, deliberately creating an illusion so that both the red and black pieces have a chance to win, luring people into the game. There are chess players everywhere, and chess players always think of themselves as masters. They often get itchy and want to compete, but they have memorized the chess manual. Where are passers-by their opponents? So the result is always that the passer-by loses money.</p>
<p>(4) "Transforming Yellow Goods" - setting up a stall on the side of the road to sell fake goods, such as gold jewelry, antiques, jade, and fake copper coins.</p>
<p>(5) "Flexible Coffin" - hanging a cloth sign on the wall, selling goods and medicine, or teaching various strange magic tricks, spouting nonsense. Their behavior is very similar to that of itinerant performers.</p>
<p>(6) "False Illness Selling Medicine" - selling medicine and giving free medical treatment on the side of the street is originally a promotional method for itinerant doctors. But there are many genuine and effective medicines among itinerant doctors. The "Cut the Head Play" gang is purely slippery in nature, picking up the appearance of the itinerant gang and selling fake medicine to cheat money. They also use partners to impersonate sick passers-by as a public test to gain the trust of passers-by. Then the fake medicine can be sold smoothly on the spot.</p>
<p>(7) "Buying and Selling" - selling collateral gold watches and silver utensils on the street, colluding with partners as passers-by to bargain and haggle in order to lure the "melon" into the trap.</p>
<p>(8) "Collecting Ingots" - When a poor or sick person dies on the street within their jurisdiction, the brothers in the gang rush to the scene and perform a crying scene of "personally viewing and containing the corpse," and then solicit donations from nearby residents to collect money for a coffin and burial. After collecting ingots, they slip away, and as a result, the street corpse still waits for the charitable hall to bury it.</p>

<h3>Appeal Hearing of the Randell Case Opens · Lawyers for Both Sides Engage in a War of Words · Shen Ke's Espionage Work Received Heavy Rewards · Appellant Claims News Was Based on Evidence · News Was Disclosed by the U.S. Military</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The suspected German military spy Shen Ke, based on a report published in the China Press on April 16 of this year, which contained a United Press dispatch claiming that Shen had been ordered by the German intelligence agency to go to Chongqing to expose the situation of underground workers of the United Nations and to explore the route for United Nations personnel to enter the interior, deemed this to be libelous behavior and filed a private prosecution with the District Court against Randell, the director of the United Press office in China. Randell was declared innocent. Shen Ke refused to accept this and appealed to the High Court. The hearing opened yesterday morning to investigate the evidence. Judge Wang Jian will continue the hearing on the morning of November 2.</p>
<p>The appellant Shen Ke, because he is still detained in the Tilanqiao Prison, was represented in court by lawyer Yao Zhaodi. Randell was still defended by lawyer Chen Tingrui, and United Press reporter Yuan Lunren served as the translator. The audience was full, especially with members of the press. Reporters from various newspapers were standing to take notes.</p>
<p>News Source · Released by the U.S. Military</p>
<p>Randell claimed: He did write this article, and the source of this news was based on documents released by the U.S. military headquarters intelligence department. Furthermore, the prosecutor in charge of investigating German war criminals held a press conference and announced this matter on the spot. The court then asked: Can you prove it? He replied: This news is based on the announcement by the authorities and can be proven. He now has a certificate issued by the U.S. military headquarters, signed by two U.S. prosecutors in charge of investigating war crimes. These two people convened the press conference, and the signatures were sworn to show solemnity.</p>
<p>At that time, lawyer Chen stood up to supplement and read the full text of the certificate, which stated that on April 16, these two prosecutors, fully representing the U.S. Army, knew from reliable evidence (note: the original text of "reliable evidence" is actually "Evidence now on file") that Shen Ke was actually sent to China in 1942 by the German military intelligence agency O'Hara to act as a German reporter to cover up the activities of secret United Nations workers and to find out the routes for United Nations personnel to sneak into the interior. Chen then submitted the certificate.</p>
<p>Publicly Announced at the Press Conference</p>
<p>The judge then asked on what date the press conference was held, because the date of the meeting recorded on the certificate was April 16, and the China Press on April 16 had already published this news, so Randell must have written this article before April 16. Randell replied: This article was written in the afternoon of the 15th and was still rushed to be published in the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post that day. It was indeed based on the press conference held that morning, because in addition to the United Press, the Associated Press and Chinese newspapers also attended the meeting, and the wording was almost entirely the same when the articles were released.</p>
<p>At that time, lawyer Yao Zhaodi refuted: The date on the certificate submitted by Randell is October 24, which seems to be specifically for today's court hearing. The phrase "Evidence nov on jlie (existing evidence)" in the certificate may not refer to evidence obtained before April 16, but was obtained recently. He requested that the U.S. military court prosecutor be summoned to explain the content of the news released at the press conference on April 16.</p>
<p>Shen Ke Had Intelligence on the China-India Pipeline</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen immediately stood up and said: If the appellant believes that the evidentiary power of the certificate is insufficient, then if today's investigative hearing does not end, the defendant can ask the U.S. military court prosecutor to appear in court! In addition to this, there is also an "official document" that can be used as new evidence. Rudolf, an accomplice in Shen Ke's espionage case, had a moment of conscience during the trial and confessed the truth, saying that the O'Hara Bureau had hired spies, and these spies had hired assistants of different nationalities. Among these spies, the three most effective were the first person, Shen Ke. He supplied information obtained from the Japanese side to intelligence agents who came to Shanghai from the Chinese interior and supplied information from the interior to Germany. This was an extremely dangerous task, and Shen Ke was able to complete it satisfactorily. Most of the information delivered to Germany was transferred by Dr. Takashima, who was responsible for liaison with the Japanese, from the O'Hara Bureau to the Japanese intelligence authorities. The most valuable information was a report on the construction of the China-India pipeline, which was later supplied to the Japanese. Shen Ke was an expert in analyzing the situation and could always point out the significance of the personnel changes in the National Government. In addition, Shen Ke also obtained a lot of U.S. military intelligence. Another accomplice, Ke Xing, also said: Shen Ke's salary in the O'Hara Bureau was the highest in the entire bureau, receiving 3,800 gold marks per month (at that time, every two and a half gold marks were equal to one U.S. dollar), while O'Hara himself received only 1,250 gold marks per day.</p>
<p>Plaintiff Exhausted His Strength in Repeated Debates</p>
<p>At this time, lawyer Yao also refuted: Rudolf had said that the above confession was actually forced, and a written "counter-evidence" was submitted. Lawyer Chen then said that the previous confession had been signed by Rudolf in court, and the details could be asked of Rudolf himself.</p>
<p>Lawyer Yao then pointed out that the defendant's reply had gone beyond the topic. The scope of this case is very clear, only the two facts about Shen Ke mentioned by the defendant in the China Press. Shen Ke is still on trial and has not been convicted. Whether he is guilty or not is still unknown. The defendant's lawyer is now emphasizing the U.S. military court, as if thinking that once someone is a villain, they can be insulted at will. This is truly intolerable in a Chinese court. Even if Shen Ke is convicted in the future, it will not affect the guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case!</p>
<p>At this time, Randell could feel impatient and angrily said: This certificate clearly states that Shen Ke's activities were to investigate the underground work activities of the United Nations in Shanghai and to investigate the routes for United Nations personnel to sneak into the interior. Furthermore, the Associated Press and other newspapers have the same reports. Why does the appellant only sue him alone? It is strange. Knowing that the formal certificate obtained from the U.S. military court cannot be considered valuable, is the evidence submitted by Shen Ke more valuable?</p>
<p>Lawyer Yao said: This case can be judged after the U.S. military court makes a verdict on Shen Ke. The appellant has no preconceived notions; the circumstances of this case are minor and the second instance is the final instance. Please consider it carefully.</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen then said: The conclusion of this case lies in whether the defendant fabricated facts. The defendant's report was based on what was released by the U.S. military, so even if there is defamation, the responsibility lies not with the defendant, but with the U.S. military department. For the sake of fairness in such foreign-related cases, it is hoped that they can be concluded as soon as possible, because foreigners cannot leave the country at will when criminal cases are involved, and the defendant, as a journalist, has the possibility of leaving the country at any time. At this point, Judge Wang then decided to continue the hearing at 10:00 AM on November 2.</p>

<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Director Discusses Electricity Conservation: Hopes Users Will Reduce Consumption by 30%</h3>
<p>Zhao Zengyu, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, held a press conference at the City Hall meeting room yesterday at 5:00 PM, reporting on the reasons and methods for electricity conservation in the city. He stated that recently, the demand for electricity in the city has exceeded the supply, making conservation necessary. Therefore, a special commissioner conducted a detailed investigation. The results showed that 60% of the city's electricity users consume less than 20 degrees of electricity per month. Therefore, it is stipulated that 20 degrees will be the standard for general electricity consumption. Those who exceed this standard will have their usage calculated at 70% of their highest usage in the past year. Violators will be fined, and a second offense will result in power disconnection. He hoped that all users would voluntarily conserve electricity. For example, if a household has ten light bulbs, they could reduce it to seven, or if they originally used 100-candlepower bulbs, they could switch to 75-candlepower bulbs. Similarly, those using 40-candlepower bulbs could switch to 25-candlepower bulbs to save electricity. The Bureau will provide individual notifications when reading electricity meters in November, and those who exceed the standard when the meters are read again in December will be penalized according to the electricity conservation measures. This electricity conservation regulation is expected to last until February or March of next year, as the city's electricity supply will then be sufficient, and the measures will be lifted. A table of estimated daily electricity consumption per light bulb is provided below for users' reference:</p>
<p>Bulb Size (Watts): 15W 25W 40W 50W 60W 75W 100W</p>
<p>3 Hours Daily Use (Degrees): 1.35 2.25 3.6 4.5 5.4 6.75 9</p>
<p>4 Hours Daily Use (Degrees): 1.8 3 4.8 6 7.2 9 12</p>
<p>5 Hours Daily Use (Degrees): 2.25 3.75 6 7.5 9 11.25 15</p>
<p>6 Hours Daily Use (Degrees): 2.7 4.5 7.2 9 10.8 13.5 18</p>
<h3>Fang Zhi Hosts Press: Hopes for Cooperation in Promoting National Policies</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, hosted a tea party for the city's press at the Lido Garden yesterday at 3:00 PM. Over a hundred guests from various newspapers attended.</p>
<p>In his impromptu speech, Fang said: The significance of today's gathering lies in two points: First, I have had a close relationship with the press in the past. When I joined the Kuomintang in the seventh year of the Republic (1918), I worked at the Minguo Daily, which was headed by Mr. Ye Chucang. Many people in the Shanghai press today are old friends of mine. I am very happy to be in Shanghai to meet new and old friends, and I would like to seek advice from everyone. Second, I would like to express my gratitude for the comments and encouragement from various newspapers before and after my swearing-in ceremony. I would also like to take this opportunity to offer a few suggestions: (1) I hope that the Party Headquarters and the press can maintain close ties, as the Party serves the people, and the press is the voice of the people, both serving the same target audience. (2) I hope that Party members and journalists can maintain close ties, as both are engaged in written work. As the ancients said, "Make friends through literature, and assist benevolence through friendship." (3) The purpose of these ties is to strive and work hard to realize the Three Principles of the People, promote national policies and decrees, and uphold peaceful unification. We should seek unified peace and unified democracy, that is, democratic unification and democratic peace. If internal strife does not cease, there will be no peace, no unification, and no democracy. Historically, the power of the pen is greater than the power of the gun, as evidenced by the success of the Xinhai Revolution and the Northern Expedition. In the future, the process of nation-building will depend even more on the pen to promote policies and encourage progress. The Party Headquarters plans to hold a general registration of Party members soon and will actively promote the teachings of the Founding Father, hoping for the cooperation of the press.</p>
<p>After Fang's speech, Wang Yunsheng, Zhao Minheng, Wan Meizi, and others spoke in succession, offering opinions on Party affairs. Finally, Fang concluded the gathering by saying that the Municipal Party Headquarters is determined to serve the people in a party manner and to handle Party affairs with a spirit of innovation.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Stranded in Germany and Italy During the War: First Batch Arrives in Hong Kong Last Week, Some Have Already Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Five hundred and eighty Chinese nationals who were stranded in Germany and Italy during the war, under the auspices of the military authorities of the Allied countries in Germany and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), boarded the "Alrando" and set sail from Naples to return to China. They arrived in Hong Kong last week. This group of refugees is the first batch transported back to the country by UNRRA from Europe. Among them, 405 returned from Italy, but only 171 received assistance from the International Relief Association and UNRRA. The remaining 234 people, and the 175 people returning from Germany, were not included in UNRRA's relief efforts, and their travel expenses should be borne by China. The UNRRA delegation in Italy and the office in China still coordinated the procedures.</p>
<p>The entire group of returning overseas Chinese were led by UNRRA representatives, Mr. and Mrs. Harmon. Among the returning overseas Chinese, there were 461 men, 67 women, and 52 children. Most of those returning from Germany were sailors. After arriving in Hong Kong, all the overseas Chinese temporarily resided in a refugee camp run by the Hong Kong authorities and then made arrangements to send them back to their places of origin. Some of the overseas Chinese have already arrived in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Answering Readers' Questions</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Miscellaneous Medical Inquiries</p>
<p>Zheng Tong Gao Zhengwang asks: (1) Why is the spread of cholera periodic? (2) How to distinguish between acute gastroenteritis and cholera? (3) Please briefly describe the treatment methods. (4) How should trachoma be treated or eradicated? (5) Should infants be given a laxative to remove fetal toxins at birth? (6) What medicine should be taken to relieve pain in the left flank? (7) Is premature ejaculation a disease that impairs fertility? Why does this disease occur? What medicine or injections should be taken to cure it? (8) How to treat neurasthenia, and how to maintain health and well-being? (9) Is the reason for not being able to eat cold drinks and fruits due to a weak stomach? What are the good remedies for it?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] (1) The growth and spread of cholera bacteria are related to climate and geographical environment, so its spread is periodic. (2) The stool of acute gastroenteritis is yellow, while the stool and vomit of cholera are rice-water-like, the skin is dry and shrunken, the eyeballs are sunken, and dehydration occurs very quickly with very serious symptoms. (3) For the treatment of acute gastroenteritis, Sulfaguanidine can be effective. For cholera, intravenous fluids with plasma and cardiac stimulants must be injected, with oral Sulfaguandine or Sulfadiazine preparations. (4) Trachoma can be cured with trachoma forceps, or with Copper Sulfate and Zinc Sulfate eye drops. (5) An infant's meconium can be naturally excreted, and there is no need to take laxatives. (6) For pain in the left flank, ordinary painkillers can be taken. (7) Premature ejaculation is caused by sexual neurasthenia and can impair fertility. Injections of male hormone preparations should be taken. (8) Those with neurasthenia should pay attention to health, get up early and go to bed early, develop good living habits and get enough sleep, and at the same time inject or take brain-strengthening and nerve-nourishing drugs. (9) Cold drinks and fruits can stimulate the gastric and intestinal membranes and prevent normal digestion, so they should be eaten less.</p>
<p>(2) Head Lumps</p>
<p>Wang Jinggen asks: "I suffered from chickenpox on my head last year, and two small lumps bulged behind my right ear. I was hospitalized for treatment for two months before it healed, but the lumps did not disappear. At that time, I thought it was a swollen lymph node caused by a headache and would disappear after healing. I dared not have surgery rashly, but more than a year after being discharged from the hospital, they have still not disappeared, and every time I think deeply, I feel a hidden pain, which is very distressing. I dare to ask what these lumps are? What is the method to eliminate them? I hope you can advise."</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] Swollen lymph nodes in the head can be treated with Anfu swelling-reducing plaster. If it is ineffective, surgical removal is necessary.</p>
<p>(3) Crooked Mouth and Eyes</p>
<p>Luo Junming asks: My wife is 29 years old this year. Three years ago, her mouth and eyes on the left side suddenly became crooked. She immediately sought treatment with traditional Chinese medicine, but after a long period of time, she still has not recovered. Some say that this disease cannot be completely cured. Currently, her left eye is constantly tearing (according to the ophthalmologist, it is due to the inverted tear duct), the eyelid is unable to contract, and chewing with the mouth feels obstructed. Her left limbs have recently had slight pain, and sometimes after waking up at night, she cannot move for a while. I don't know what the disease is, please tell me how to treat it.</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] Your wife's illness is facial nerve palsy. You should first check whether her blood pressure is too high. If it is a high blood pressure condition, Eutodon injections and Theomiual tablets can be taken.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Allocation Method Agreed Upon: Duplicate Product Industry Establishes Joint Organization</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Textile and Fabric Industry Management Committee, chaired by concurrent Chairman Wu, allocated 12,004 and a half bales of cotton yarn to various cotton yarn duplicate product industries. Yesterday, representatives from the Six District Cotton Textile Guild and the Textile Construction Company, together with representatives from six guilds, including the Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry, thoroughly discussed the allocation procedures at the Hankou Road Textile Construction Company conference room. Jiang , Deputy Director of the Business Department of the Textile Construction Company, presided over the meeting. It was decided that the total amount of yarn to be allocated would be distributed in two installments (i.e., Monday, October 28th, and Monday, November 4th). Each yarn mill will prepare a form every Monday listing the cotton yarn of various branches and trademarks and their prices, and submit it to the Cotton Textile Guild. At the same time, a reservation order will be issued for the cotton yarn allocated. The duplicate product industry guilds will allocate it to member customers based on the yarn allocation table and submit the table to the Cotton Textile Guild. The Guild will issue a reservation order based on the table. The contracted factory will prepare the payment and exchange it for a warehouse receipt from the yarn mill, which must be cleared within ten days.</p>
<p>In addition, the six duplicate product industry guilds in the city, including machinery dyeing and weaving, knitting, underwear, towel, blanket, handkerchief, and handmade cotton weaving guilds, convened a joint meeting of the guilds at 5:00 PM yesterday at the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Guild to execute the work of contracting and allocating cotton yarn and to establish close contact. Representatives of each guild attended the meeting. Pan Shihao presided over the meeting. First, the representative who attended the Textile Management Committee meeting in the morning reported on the process of negotiating the allocation procedures. It was agreed to establish a permanent joint organization, named the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Duplicate Product Industry Guild Yarn Allocation Committee. The chairman, vice-chairman, and group leaders for the examination, allocation, and evaluation groups were elected to smoothly promote the yarn allocation work.</p>
<h3>Yarn Mills Whose Cotton Inventory Is Less Than Three Months Can Apply for Foreign Exchange to Purchase American Cotton</h3>
<p>After Mayor Wu went to Nanjing to meet with President Song and made inquiries about the American cotton foreign exchange issue, it is understood that President Song has indicated approval for the resumption of foreign exchange. Mayor Wu then decided that all yarn mills whose current cotton inventory is insufficient for three months can apply for foreign exchange to purchase American cotton. However, to clarify the situation, in addition to ordering the Cotton Trade Association to report the actual amount of cotton in stock to the Textile Management Committee by the 28th of this month, a form will also be prepared to investigate the production situation of each factory, the type and quantity of cotton required. The survey form must be filled in and submitted within one week. Those who report more than they have will have their extra cotton confiscated. Those who do not report after the deadline will be deemed to have given up their rights. It is understood that the cotton inventory of most yarn mills is less than three months' worth. According to the current situation, at least 2 million bales of American cotton need to be ordered.</p>
<h3>Quiet Bond Market</h3>
<p>The bond market was sluggish yesterday, with inconsistent supply and demand. Most transactions were small, so the fluctuations were minimal. The Unified C bonds opened at 2030 yuan in the morning. After opening, they stabilized at 2050 yuan for a while. Later, due to the sluggish stock market, buying interest decreased slightly, and they briefly fell below the 2000 yuan mark. However, they finally closed at around 2050 yuan, with little change from the previous close. A and B bonds rose by 20 yuan, D bonds were flat, and Unified E bonds rose by 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice and Wheat Continue to Decline, Oil Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market registered over 9,000 shih of cargo, and digestion remained sluggish. Northern Japonica rice was high and flat, while secondary rice was sluggish. Southern Japonica middle and secondary grade rice had few buyers and fell by 1,000 yuan. Yuan Rice was sluggish, and Yin rice was reduced by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The oil market had scarce arrivals. Scarcity makes things valuable. Raw oil and bean oil were rarely available on the market, with only sesame oil having some transactions. Prices were advancing towards a peak. Bean cake oil had strong sales in Shantou, and factories supplied as much as possible, falling back by 300 to 500 yuan. Wheat remained sluggish and unchanged, falling by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean arrivals continued, making it difficult to prosper, and continued to fall by 1,000 yuan. Mung beans had little activity. Corn was sluggish, raw peanuts were actively sold in small lots, and prices were rising. Yellow hemp continued to be handled in the South Seas, rising by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customers Must Use Bank Drafts to Purchase Oil Cakes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Oil Mill and Firewood Industry Association has informed the relevant associations that, according to the association's application, all customers who purchase oil cakes from the factories in the industry must use bank or money shop drafts when issuing warehouse receipts, in order to show solemnity.</p>
<h3>Ban on Wheat Re-exports: Jianghai Customs Has Announced Implementation; Flour Rationing Is 9,000 Bags Daily</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the Executive Yuan issued an order prohibiting the re-export of wheat, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has announced its implementation on the 24th. From that date, all wheat reported for re-export by the Jianghai Customs, like flour, must first be approved by the Ministry of Food. However, wheat shipped by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is not subject to this restriction. According to people in the flour industry, the wheat inventory in Shanghai is extremely depleted. Since the ban on re-exports, the market price has fallen to 30,000 yuan per dan. The Flour Industry Association still rations 9,000 bags of flour to flour merchants according to the daily consumption of flour in the city, and they then re-ration it to various cake and steamed bun businesses. It is reported that the Tangyuan, Qiemian (noodles), and Paste industries in the city have also petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the association to allocate some flour. It is said that the association plans to hand over the entire daily rationing amount of only 9,000 bags to the Social Affairs Bureau for overall allocation.</p>
<h3>China Silk Corporation Develops Overseas Sales Channels: Negotiations with France Are Quite Successful, American Market Is Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Taibao Report] China Silk Corporation is working hard to develop overseas raw silk sales markets. Recent negotiations with France have been quite successful. It is heard that France has a strong demand for silk, and the price it has offered is higher than that of the United States. In addition, there are also negotiations in the South Seas area. Qualified personnel pointed out that our country should not have overly optimistic expectations for the sales of raw silk in the United States. Because some American financial groups have actually controlled the Japanese silk industry, the market price of raw silk has been repeatedly lowered. Secondly, the rate of price increases in China and the United States differs too much. Although the United States is experiencing inflation today, prices have not increased more than threefold, while the selling price of raw silk has risen from $2 per pound in 1937 to $700, so sales are naturally not smooth. In addition, the government is determined to export raw silk. Even if the cost is higher than that of other countries, it will adopt a subsidy policy to export it in large quantities, in order to maintain the overseas market.</p>
<h3>Retail Investors Light Up the Market: Chinese Stocks Have Difficulty Rising</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were slightly stable on the local market yesterday, but buying interest remained extremely limited and soon declined again. At the opening, each stock opened slightly higher, but soon sellers became active, and there was no new buying activity in the market. With the lighting up of scattered buyers, the situation was unable to develop. Guangbang (Cantonese investors) did some buying, and the middle of the day rose slightly from the low, but the overall trend was difficult to rise. The traders at the table shorted the machine, making it easy to fall and difficult to rise. Near noon, Mayar created a new low price. Before closing, the shorts slightly covered their positions, and arbitrageurs came in to trade slightly after the low. The afternoon close was slightly lower than the previous close for the popular stocks of Wingsha, Sino, and Xinguang. Mayar, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by about half a percent. Tongyi, Rongfeng, Lianan, and Jinglun were flat for the cold stocks. The rest all fell. In the afternoon, due to the two-day interest relationship, it opened well, but the road to advancement was blocked by high arbitrageurs selling out, and gradually shrank. However, there were still many scattered activities near the close, and it was still stable. As a result, the popular stocks of Yongs, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Mayar fell slightly compared with the previous close. Sino alone rose slightly. The cold stocks of Zhongfang, Datong, Zhongsi, Huochai Company, and Wuli Underwear all fell by about half a percent. Tongyi, Rongfeng, Xinya, and Lianan were flat. Cement Huafeng fell slightly. The total turnover was 6.73 million shares. The prices of various stocks outside the market were stable with little change.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were flat at first and then tired, and it was difficult to recover. There were not many transactions, and the market was quiet. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha, Yinglianye, and Guang Paper each fell slightly. Huidefeng, Shipping, Steel, and Yipi each fell by about half a percent.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Rise: Foreign Currencies Are Stable</h3>
<p>Haqi continued to prosper yesterday, but there was increased pressure at high prices, and it hovered a little more. Sheng opened at 2,255,000. After opening, it gradually stabilized from 2,250,000, but the fluctuations were limited. It was only at ten o'clock that the Central Bank distributed 100 bars at a price of 2,252,500. After this, customer sales were still strong, and funds were even tighter. It once rose to above 2,260,000, but then the pressure increased, and near noon it fell to below 2,250,000. At noon, it still closed at around 2,255,000. In the afternoon, next-day delivery continued to prosper and once rose to 2,270,000 before leveling off slightly. As a result, it rose by another 12,000 compared with the previous close. Decorative gold hung up to 1.44 million, silver was flat, and silver dollars rose slightly. The under-the-table interest rate was even looser, and interest rates fell to about 1.2%.</p>
<p>The transaction of U.S. dollars in the retail market did not develop. In the black market, it was about 4,130 yuan to 4,180 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars rose slightly due to the price of gold. There were many buys and sells at around 890 yuan yesterday. As a result, it rose slightly compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was similar, reporting 885 yuan to 895 yuan. Indian remittances were traded at 1,070 yuan, British remittances were traded at 14,100 yuan to 14,300 yuan, and the U.S. exchange rate was not changed, and there were no matching transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Are Largely Set: 77 Centimeters Is Still a Problem</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After consultation with relevant agencies, the purchase price of raw silk will no longer be changed in most cases. Yesterday's Central Bank meeting mainly discussed whether 77 cm raw silk should be calculated as grade D or grade E. Because in the United States, grade D is 78 cm. If our country purchases according to this standard, the income of silk merchants will be reduced. According to an expert reporter: In the United States, each grade of silk does not differ by 110,000 yuan. Now our country is 175,000 yuan, which is already very generous to silk merchants.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branches Rebound</h3>
<p>Jinshan branches have recently become more active in sales, and production prices have increased. Therefore, the price here has also followed closely. Yesterday, the market price of high-grade Zhuangyuan branches opened at 246,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan, and flat branches at 252,000 yuan, an increase of about 10% compared with before.</p>
<h3>Gauze All Decline: Cotton Mills Begin to Sell Off Stock; "Cai Kui" Reaches New Low Price</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Yesterday, the yarn market still showed no improvement. Dealers were extremely dispirited. "Special Double Horse" declined directly, closing at 2.3 million, a decrease of 50,000 compared to yesterday. Other brands were also very weak, all falling by 20,000 to 60,000. In particular, the "Hong Kui" and "Cai Kui" brands of Dasheng Yarn Mill had excessive stock, with many sellers. "Cai Kui" once fell to 2.01 million, the lowest price recently. The 42-count yarn was especially difficult to sell, and cotton mills were instead seen selling off their stock, although price adjustments were small.</p>
<p>Since the Textile Control Commission has repeatedly convened meetings to effectively plan the stabilization of yarn and cloth prices, market prices have stabilized. In addition, the joint cotton yarn distribution continues, and the cloth market has gradually declined as a result. In recent days, local merchants in this city have been sluggish in their purchases due to financial constraints. Yesterday, high-end fine cloth such as "Five Blessings Blue Phoenix" from Fangjian was traded at 76,000. Although the price of dyes for "Shilin" cloth has soared, the cloth price is still very weak. "Lanting 190" Shilin cloth produced by Renfeng Factory opened at 125,000 yuan, and "Big Deer Yan Tu Lin" cloth produced on the mainland opened at 120,000 yuan. Other goods also showed weakness.</p>
<h3>Asking Prices High, Transactions Few: Rayon Black Market Reaches Saturation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market was relatively stable in the morning, but suddenly showed an upward trend in the afternoon. "120" Tianqiao old stock (glossy) was quoted as high as 3.7 million, and various other brands were driven up. "120" Jin San Ma (glossy) was traded at 3.48 million, and mixed brands (semi-gloss) were quoted at 3.05 million, a sharp increase of 100,000 compared to the previous day. However, there were very few transactions, and factory managers were also quite calm. DE grade was quoted 50,000 higher than the previous day, while the price of dried silk remained unchanged. Only a dozen bales were traded throughout the day. The silk market remained cautious, mainly because customers were not making large purchases, and business in local silk and satin stores was also very slow, leading to this situation.</p>
<h3>Fuel Control Commission to Adjust Coal Prices After Allocation? More Taiwanese Coal Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Fuel Management Committee, it is rumored that the committee will adjust the price of allocated coal from next month. However, to maintain production, the price of coal for industrial factories will not be changed, remaining at 140,000 yuan per ton. The allocated quantity will depend on the arrival of goods. Currently, coal sources are gradually becoming clearer, and there should be no shortage of coal for industrial use.</p>
<p>It is reported that 20 coal mines in Taiwan have been taken over, with 12 in operation and 8 not yet restarted. The production volume of operating mines is gradually increasing. Currently, transportation between Shanghai and Taiwan is quite convenient, with an average of two or three ships per month transporting materials from Taiwan Province to Shanghai, mainly coal. It is said that Taiwan Province still has 135,000 metric tons of coal waiting to be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Red Rice Production Price Rises</h3>
<p>Previously, red rice sales were scarce and sluggish, leading to a significant reduction in shipments from production areas. Recently, with the gradual movement of winter sales, prices have risen repeatedly. It is said that the market price in Shantou for high-quality goods has already exceeded 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Launches Original Currency Remittance: Performance Good in Past Half Month, but National Currency Remittances Decrease Relatively</h3>
<p>Our country is a country with an extremely large deficit. Overseas Chinese remittances, which offset foreign exchange, have always occupied an important position. In the past, remittances from Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia were very large. Currently, Overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom and the United States have risen to the top position. Before March 4 of this year, during the period of controlled foreign exchange, overseas Chinese remittances were exclusively operated by the Bank of China. After the opening up, many foreign banks also operated in this area, and many Overseas Chinese remittances were lost as a result. The main route was Hong Kong, followed by banks that needed foreign exchange. Based on the Bank of China's statistics, the lost amount in October of last year, during the period of control, totaled 1.09 billion yuan, equivalent to 5.45 million US dollars, while in July of this year it was only 3.8 billion yuan, equivalent to less than 2 million US dollars. Comparing the two, we can see the magnitude of the foreign exchange loss.</p>
<p>Since the opening of foreign exchange and the operation of overseas Chinese remittances by foreign banks, the Bank of China planned to launch original currency remittances. However, restricted by the fact that government banks cannot operate in original currency remittances, and fearing that foreign currency would not be exchanged and withdrawn after being remitted, implementation was delayed. After detailed statistics and investigation, it was confirmed that 80% of the sources of Overseas Chinese remittances were to support their families and would not be kept in the bank for a long time. Therefore, original currency remittances were launched on Double Ten Day. According to sources from the Bank of China, the daily amount has not been very large in the past half month since the launch, but it has been increasing daily. However, the overall Overseas Chinese remittances have not increased as a result. The increase in original currency remittances is offset by a decrease in national currency remittances.</p>
<h3>Pig Iron Prices Soar; Orders Expected Soon</h3>
<p>For months, pig iron orders arriving in Shanghai have been greatly reduced due to huge consumption, so iron merchants have not ordered from countries such as the UK and the US for a long time, resulting in sparse local inventory and a sharp rise in prices. In just over ten days, the price has soared from 700,000 yuan to 1.8 million yuan per ton, exceeding the selling prices of wrought iron and hot-rolled iron by a large margin. It is said that orders will arrive soon, and the market price should return to stability.</p>
<h3>Hailin Wool Market Lacks Goods</h3>
<p>Hailin wool sticks have been popular for seventeen or eighteen years. After August 13th, imported goods disappeared, and domestic factory goods appeared. However, due to raw materials and sales relationships, they have decreased year by year. At the same time, the street's demand has also been lacking, resulting in a situation of quiet supply and demand in the past two years. Since last year's victory, customer demand has surged. Due to the shortage of woolen cloth in various places, Hailin wool sticks have once again attracted attention, leading to the successive sale of limited old stock. Currently, the market lacks goods, and sales are very smooth.</p>
<h3>Native Paper Sales to the North Cut Off</h3>
<p>Native paper, such as heavy-edged paper and mao bian paper, has recently seen a surge in sales and a gradual rise in prices. Religious paper from eastern Zhejiang, such as haifang and ba si huang, was mainly sold to North China. This autumn, transportation has not returned to normal, and transporting to Hebei and Shandong faces numerous obstacles along the way. However, the price difference between Shanghai-Hangzhou and North China is significant, so merchants are not afraid of difficulties and transport the paper for sale. However, in recent months, transportation has become too difficult, so no one is carrying the goods, and the market situation is difficult to improve.</p>
<h3>New Asphalt to Hit the Market; Higher Costs Make Low Prices Unlikely; Several Hundred Bundles of Jiaxing Asphalt Already Dumped</h3>
<p>The date for new asphalt production is approaching, and old asphalt is being sold off everywhere. However, users are waiting for new asphalt, inevitably harboring expectations. Moreover, those using it for soap making have already placed orders, and those using it for candle making were preparing for the peak winter season. However, because they are all waiting for cheap new asphalt, the market has been less lively recently. On the other hand, in Hangzhou, the market is gradually turning as supplies have dwindled. It is said that the yield in the Jinlan area this winter is lower than last year, and the estimated purchase price for new asphalt is 100,000 yuan. If so, it will not be cheaper than old asphalt. However, the situation in Jiaxing is better than last year, with several hundred bundles of new asphalt already dumped in various places in the Suzhou area, with prices ranging from 90,000 yuan to 95,000 yuan. Payment must be made before the Beginning of Winter, and asphalt will be delivered between Heavy Snow and the Winter Solstice. It is said that the price of cypress seeds has already been seen, and the purchase price is 25,000 to 26,000 yuan per stone. Based on this, the cost of new asphalt cannot be too low in the future, probably around 100,000 yuan. Local dealers' sales prices have not fluctuated much, with 本车柏油 (ben che bai you) priced at 135,000 yuan, 内坪柏油 (nei ping bai you) at 125,000 yuan, 各牌独砠 (ge pai du zhu) at 120,000 yuan, 的干 (de gan) at 115,000 yuan, 尖麻城 (jian ma cheng) at 110,000 yuan, 荆州油 (jing zhou you) at 120,000 yuan, and 次等麻城油 (ci deng ma cheng you) at 100,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Previous Orders from Japanese Factories Ordered to Be Fulfilled and Replenished</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently plans to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo. For enemy and puppet economic enterprises that have been taken over in our country's recovered areas, if they had ordered equipment from Japanese factories before the Japanese surrender but had not yet been delivered due to the end of the war, they will be ordered by Japan to fulfill the contract and replenish the goods. To this end, the Executive Yuan specially instructed the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to inform all agencies to investigate and list the equipment that had been ordered from the Japanese side but had not been delivered, with detailed explanations of the original contract attached, and to reply to the ministry by letter for compilation.</p>
<h3>Gallnuts Scarce</h3>
<p>Gallnuts, produced in our country, are one of the important raw materials for dyes. In addition to the annual production of several hundred dans each in Hunan and the border areas of Anhui and Zhejiang, most of the production is in Sichuan Province. Among them, 桷西棓 (jue xi bei) has a mild tannic acid content, while 肚棓 (du bei) is quite strong, each with its own chemical characteristics. For example, the fame of Nanjing tribute satin in the past was due to the use of 肚棓 (du bei) to penetrate the pigment, which could make the luster of the satin surface permanently unchanged. Recently, goods from Sichuan Province have been scarce, the reason being the slow transportation time. Each ship takes more than a month to come to Shanghai from Chongqing, and merchants have no profit to be made, so there are few arrivals in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>6,000 Tons of Sugar Arrive in Shanghai; City Distributes Sugar Every Thursday</h3>

The association's prices for spot goods rose to 136,750 yuan for No. 20 medium-grain white sugar and 114,500 yuan to 5,000 yuan for raw sugar. Small bags of white sugar recently reached a minimum price of 155,000 yuan. It is said that there is a temporary lack of later batches, so the price turned firm, quoted at 158,000 yuan. No. 24 coarse white sugar was 178,000 yuan to 180,000 yuan. Several dozen bags of 油头黄崙青 (you tou huang lun qing) were opened yesterday at 119,000 yuan to 8,500 yuan. Jianbang 刁青 (diao qing) high-quality goods were 119,000 yuan, and secondary 二睛 (er qing) goods were 156,000 yuan. Due to the lower quality of 浙之议鸟青 (zhe zhi yi niao qing), it was only priced at 83,000 yuan, with only a few dozen bags traded.</p>
<h3>US Newsprint Supply Limited</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 24th] The US government is currently considering restoring government control over the distribution of newsprint, but relevant parties say that this control will not be revived.

Although perfume and face powder are taxable items, they should still be treated as luxury goods according to the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. Therefore, customs will still prohibit the import of these items.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Xiu Mei Traded at 63,000 Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xiu Mei, a low-end green tea, is sold to Morocco in Africa. Although the new goods from Wenzhou have arrived in Shanghai for a long time this year, unfortunately, the selling price is very high, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to reach an agreement. It was not until yesterday that Wuchang Tea Company opened trading, with a total of 63 boxes traded, at a price of 63,000 yuan per dan. For other varieties, high-end black tea is still preferred, and British foreign firms continue to demand it, especially the finest Bailin new black tea. As for old green tea, most of it is moldy and does not suit the taste of buyers, and trading is on the decline.</p>
<h3>Fir Timber Abundant, Prices Weak</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been many arrivals of fir timber from Fujian, and prices have become weak. The price of both large and small fir timber has fallen by 10 yuan per foot. Liu'an plywood is scarce and prices are firm. The 37-foot plywood is particularly popular, but there are very few arrivals, so the price remains firm. Songban plywood has recently been available on the market, but the arrival of pine logs is not very smooth, so it cannot be supplied in large quantities.</p>

<h3>Victory for Huasheng: Coming from Behind to Defeat Enkas</h3>
<p>Reversal in the Final Quarter</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Last night, the Huasheng basketball team, in the final ten minutes, launched a lightning-fast counterattack, overcoming a significant deficit to defeat Enkas, achieving a come-from-behind victory. The crowd of over a thousand spectators cheered continuously. The score was 41-36, with Huasheng winning by five points. In the first half, Enkas led by a significant ten points, with a score of 21-11.</p>
<p>Huasheng appeared dispirited at the start of the game last night, and their play was disjointed. Enkas also seemed out of sorts. The first quarter ended 6-4, with the Tianjin team ahead by two points. Huasheng performed even worse in the second quarter, with Wang Hongbin scoring only two baskets. The first half ended 21-11. In the third quarter, Huasheng continued to struggle, with the score at 19-28. In the final quarter, the situation suddenly changed. Huasheng's shots hit the mark in quick succession, scoring seven consecutive points, bringing the score to 28-29, just one point behind. Jin Liang, Hongbin, and Jin Ming then scored six more points, ultimately taking the lead at 34-31. Enkas panicked and was unable to recover. The final score was 41-36, marking Huasheng's first victory. Due to leave constraints, Huasheng players will depart Shanghai for Tianjin on the 28th. Thus, the game against the Shantou team has been moved to 5:00 PM tomorrow at the gymnasium.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Should Supervise Its Subordinates to Fully Implement the Central Tasks for the Next Year</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan previously issued directives regarding the national policy guidelines and common central tasks for all provinces and cities for the thirty-sixth year, ordering them to be followed. It is now reported that, to ensure the implementation of the central tasks for the next year, the municipal government has been instructed to supervise its subordinates and fully implement the approved central tasks. However, other work should maintain its existing scale and effectiveness. The municipal government, upon receiving the order, also instructed its subordinates to comply, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Twenty-First District Office Assists with Land Registration</h3>
<p>The District Office of the Twenty-First District (Xinshijie), to assist the Land Bureau in promoting land registration, specially instructed the full-time cadres of each pao during this general household re-census to work with the assistant staff of the District Office to explain door-to-door, urging people to register at the mobile collection point in the Civilian Village. In the past ten days, property owners and others have been enthusiastically registering, it is said. Furthermore, since the District Office began centralizing the transcription of household registrations, the full-time cadres of each pao have worked diligently, often working day and night. Currently, over half of all household registrations have been transcribed, and it is expected to be completed soon, it is said.</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the American Election: A Great Mobilization of Women: Mrs. Roosevelt Engages in a Propaganda War</h3>
<p>One morning in early October, the landlady handed me a letter with a playful smile and said, "Mr. Mao, you have a wife. Why didn't you tell us sooner?" I took the letter with surprise. "Mrs. Mao" was written on the envelope.</p>
<p>The letter was from the American Democratic Women's Association. It was an invitation, stating that the Democratic Women's Association would hold a lecture at the Midtown Building on 34th Street at 8:00 PM on October 7. The speakers included Mrs. Roosevelt, Mrs. Lehman, and several other unfamiliar names. It expressed the hope that I would attend on time. Since I did not have a "wife," I was about to throw it into the wastebasket when I suddenly noticed the words "Men are welcome to attend" on the back of the invitation. This was an important discovery, at least from the perspective of a journalist.</p>
<p>The chairwoman was Miss Wilkins. She first introduced Mrs. Roosevelt. Mrs. Roosevelt's speeches have always been both serious and humorous. Her deep and steady voice was even more relaxed and interesting than when she spoke at the United Nations. She said: Elections are the freedom of the people. I cannot force you to elect anyone, but I would like to recommend Mead and Lehman to you. Then she greatly praised Mead and Lehman, but not excessively or disgustingly. She did not mention "the Republican Party," but always said "the opposing party." Her criticism of the Republican Party was thorough. Each time she mentioned "the opposing party," the audience burst into laughter.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt on the Platform: She Said: Not to Rule Men, But to Cooperate Equally with Men</h3>
<p>At the women's conference, Mrs. Roosevelt did not talk about foreign policy or the world situation. To suit the tastes of the female audience, her speech was very popular. At least, in all the Mrs. Roosevelt's speeches I've heard, it was the most popular. She said that if the Democratic Party candidates were elected, they would definitely seek happiness for the sisters in New York State. She said: "Our women's demands on American politics are: "Of The Women by The Women, For The Women" (I don't know how to translate this)," But, she then added, "We do not ask to rule men, but to cooperate equally with men." The audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>In her speech, Mrs. Roosevelt mentioned her husband once, and the crowd cheered wildly. The American people's remembrance of the late President Roosevelt is a rare phenomenon in American history. Speaking about how women can register to vote, Mrs. Roosevelt suddenly became "old-fashioned" and said: "I am old, and I don't understand these procedures very well. Let me introduce to you Mrs. Norton, a young female comrade in our Democratic Party!" With that, she sat down.</p>
<p>In fact, Mrs. Norton was also gray-haired. She was a female senator in New York State and a key member of the Democratic Party's activities in New York State. She was wearing a "foreign drum hat," which was a bit "odd."</p>
<h3>Mrs. Lehman Supports Her Husband</h3>
<p>Then, Mrs. Roosevelt introduced Mrs. Lehman to speak. She introduced her by saying: "This is the wife of our former New York State Governor, and now the wife of a candidate for the New York State Senate." Mrs. Lehman was very elegant, but she inevitably felt a little "stage fright" in an unfamiliar setting. She read from four pages of prepared speeches, the content of which was to hope that everyone would register quickly and not give up the right to vote, and that she would hope that everyone would elect her husband to be a member of the Senate representing New York. Her support for her husband did not cause any aversion. The wording and tone were both very modest and sincere.</p>
<h3>Only Those Who Are Registered Have the Right to Vote</h3>
<p>A virtuous and capable wife is a necessary condition for people in politics in a democratic country.</p>
<p>Afterward, a male guest gave a speech. He was sent by the Democratic Party to support the women's fire party. He spoke very little. He told many humorous and light-hearted jokes about the "relationship between men and women" to arouse the interest of the audience. Then, he urged everyone to quickly register as voters. In New York, the mobility of the population is the greatest. New York does not have a system like China's baojia system, so who has the right to vote and who does not is very problematic. Therefore, "registration" is a very important step. Only those who are registered have the right to vote. The election date is November 5, and the registration dates are from October 7 to 12. In a country like the United States, their interest is in making money, post-making money hedonism, as well as seeking a better life and enjoyment. The average American citizen has no interest in politics. Therefore, the number of people who give up registration is very large. Their campaign movements are secondary to boasting about themselves. The first thing they do is to urge people to register enthusiastically. Only after they have registered can they talk about elections and other things.</p>
<h3>Life First: An Old Man is Dissatisfied with Reality</h3>
<p>I did not listen to the entire program and left the meeting hall. An old man in his fifties yawned and walked with me. He said: Mrs. Roosevelt is very popular. I asked him if he would vote for the Democratic Party. He smiled and said, "Thirty years ago, America had plenty of pork, beef and ham. Pork was eighteen cents a pound and ham was twenty-four cents." He said that he got married in New York thirty years ago, "That was when life was comfortable!" I asked him: "What about now?"</p>
<p>He compared his hands: "You can't buy anything!"</p>
<p>"So, do you mean that you are going to elect the Republican Party?"</p>
<p>"I don't even know myself!"</p>
<p>I could see his dissatisfaction with the current situation. Life, life, everything is life first! On the way home, I bought a copy of the "Daily Mirror" at the tram station. It had a cartoon of many stores on the street with signs on their glass windows saying: "No meat, sugar, milk," etc. At the end of the street was a sign that read: "Election Registration Office, Welcome to Register."</p>
<p>This is a very, very real problem. The Democratic Party's economic policies have contributed to the world, but, as of today, the serious economic imbalances in the United States cannot be denied in any way.</p>
<h3>Establishing a New Standard: Rectifying Officialdom in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou Report, 16th [of Month], by Special Correspondent Yusheng</p>
<p>There is an old saying in China: "Promotion and wealth" means that if a person becomes an official, money will come rolling in. Therefore, General Yue Fei once had the warning: "Civil officials do not love money, military officials are not afraid of death." Why can one "get rich" after being "promoted"? In the past, officials were seen as the parents of the people, and illegitimate children had to be filial to their parents. A place was equal to a family. Officials were the heads of the family, and they could use money as they pleased. Since the Republic of China, the "official" has been changed to a "public servant," but in reality, the "official" is still the "official," and the common people still have to be filial. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the style of the "officials" did not change, compared with the past, it was just a change in form. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the "officials'" salaries were low, not enough to maintain life, so "unexpected income" and "extra demands" became common phenomena.</p>
<p>Some people say: "All crows in the world are black." Zhejiang, which has always been known for its relatively enlightened politics, is no exception. When the county magistrate takes office, there is a welcome feast, and you can't get away from it. When the county magistrate leaves office, there is a farewell feast, and you can't get away from it. While the county magistrate is in office, he wants to please the local sellers with "affection," and the local gentry want to talk about "affection," but there is no way to avoid it. The county magistrate can make money in "affection." As for the civil servants below the county level, they are especially majestic, and many people can only dare to be angry but not speak out.</p>
<p>As of the end of September this year, there have been a total of 385 changes of county magistrates in Zhejiang Province, but less than one-third, or 121, have been settled, and the rest are still pending. Of the remaining 264 unsettled cases, excluding 48 cases that are about to be completed and 26 cases with no set deadline, we can analyze them into five categories: (1) 44 cases where the successor has not investigated. (2) 47 cases where the investigation has begun. (3) 34 cases where the files were lost and the office was cleared for transfer. (4) 55 cases where the transfer procedures were not complete. (5) 10 cases where the investigation was completed but not reported. Based on this statistic, we are saddened by the failure to settle the accounts during the transfer of county magistrates, which inevitably makes people feel suspicious. Among them, we should pay special attention to the 44 county magistrates whose successors have not investigated.</p>
<h3>A Full Month's Salary is Only Enough to Smoke Cigarettes</h3>
<p>I have met many county magistrates and county-level civil servants, and they all say that it is not easy to be a county-level civil servant. Five months ago, the county magistrate could only get 50,000 to 80,000 yuan per month, and the section chief could only get 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Assuming that the county magistrate smokes a pack of cigarettes every day at a price of 900 yuan, then it would cost 27,000 yuan a month. If you add smoking cigarettes to entertain guests, wouldn't it cost more than 50,000 yuan? Then a section chief's salary cannot be used to smoke cigarettes, and the county magistrate's salary for the entire month is only enough to smoke cigarettes. However, the county magistrate's entire family has to rely on him to support them. Even if they do some part-time work, the county government can use them, and they can live in the county government, but they still have to pay for their daily meals. From time to time, people from above come, and they must be entertained, drinking alcohol and tasting tea, all of which require money. Where does the county magistrate's money come from? Therefore, a special commissioner of Zhejiang Province said at an administrative meeting: "The result of the low salaries of civil servants is that there is no official who is not corrupt."</p>
<h3>Banning Extortion and Taxes: Why Are There Still Apportionments?</h3>
<p>Yes, many county officials in Zhejiang Province harass the people, causing them to live in poverty. There are endless donations, such as the revitalization donation and the construction donation. Where did the money go? Has the place been revitalized? Has it been built? I have also met many fair people in the area, and their expressions to the county officials are, on the one hand, to sympathize with the poverty of the county officials, and on the other hand, to hate the extortion of the county officials. Although the Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to ban all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, some counties are still using the pretext of running education and building water conservancy projects to apportion money from the people. We are not against running education and water conservancy projects, but we want the people to feel that education and water conservancy must be run, and let the people solicit donations. This is meaningful. However, some responsible people in the county said: "The Zhejiang Provincial Government's ban on apportionments and the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes are just a piece of paper. The county government's finances are difficult, and it is impossible to do without apportionments."</p>
<h3>Relying on the Power of the Government: Officials and Businessmen Do Not Distinguish Between Public and Private Affairs</h3>
<p>Prices are like a man-eating tiger, constantly jumping. County-level civil servants who are relatively capable will naturally gather some money, do some speculative business, or lend some high-interest loans. Relying on the power of the government, they are naturally more successful than other businessmen. As a result, prices jump even higher. This meager salary is naturally not worth considering, and the officialdom is a good backer for conducting their own business. In this way, officials and businessmen are not distinguished, public and private affairs are not distinguished, and affection and law are not distinguished. It is a chaotic and muddled mess.</p>
<h3>It is Not Easy to Break the Habit of a Greedy Cat</h3>
<p>Two months ago, the civil servants in the Zhejiang District were adjusted, with a base salary of 60,000 yuan and a multiplier of 300. The salary of the county magistrate, from the sixth to the first grade of the recommended level, ranged from 150,000 yuan to 180,000 yuan. The salary of the section chief, from the sixth to the first grade of the assigned level, ranged from 96,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan. Compared with the 30,000 to 40,000 yuan or 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, it is naturally better, but it is not easy to immediately improve the behavior of a greedy cat that has become accustomed to eating and stealing. Those who are also engaged in business are still the same, and those who are still trying to find extra ways to demand are still the same, so prices are even higher and life is even more difficult to maintain. Recently, the salary has been adjusted again, with a base salary of 90,000 yuan and a multiplier of 540. The salary of the county magistrate ranges from 200,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan, and the salary of the section chief ranges from 150,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan. If you can save money and live a frugal life, and truly "worry about the world before the world worries," you can still maintain it. It's just that we still have to see if we can make up our minds to resolutely ban all habits and all malpractices.</p>
<h3>Seeing Bad Officials Makes Us Ignore the Good Ones</h3>
<p>Now, the general public thinks that officials are sure to be corrupt and make money, and the officials think that their salaries cannot keep up with prices, so what can they do without some extra demands? Having said that, in fact, there are also many civil servants who do not have any extra demands, who truly live a difficult life, and who work diligently, but they are taken over by some people who have corrupted the atmosphere. People only see the bad ones and ignore the good ones. I once thought: if all civil servants were not corrupt, did not do business, and lived a difficult life, then prices would not rise so much, and perhaps the living salaries of civil servants would have been adjusted long ago. It is a pity that those who cannot keep their integrity have ruined the reputation of civil servants.</p>
<h3>Ardently Hoping for Reform: Do Not Follow the Old Path of Officialdom</h3>
<p>The reporter sincerely hopes that the Zhejiang Sparrow government can make up its mind to make a new start. In addition to strictly prohibiting apportionments and abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, there also needs to be an order strictly prohibiting civil servants from engaging in business. Regarding the strict prohibition of civil servants from engaging in business, the public should be encouraged to report violations, otherwise, half-official and half-businessman, officials and businessmen will not be distinguished, the officialdom will also become a store, and the store will be similar to the government, only to suffer the poor people who are gasping for breath under high prices.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is also necessary to strictly prohibit civil servants from extravagantly entertaining and stipulate economical ways to entertain guests. Rewarding honest officials is really the way to rectify officialdom. There is also one of the most important things, that is, the personnel system must be sound, otherwise, the county magistrate will have the idea of being a temporary official for five days in the capital, and will be afraid of being transferred as soon as he takes office. Naturally, he will try to make a fortune while in office.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province was originally a province with relatively enlightened politics. It is really hard to say how enlightened it has been in recent years. We hope that officials must have a good heart and be determined to be good officials, and the superiors should also think more for good officials and establish a new and sound standard.</p>

<p>Jiangxi Mobile Medical Team Departs for Epidemic Areas to Work (Photo by Special Correspondent Liu Zao)</p>
<h3>"Black Alert" in Eastern Jiangxi! Constructing a Strong Fortress to Encircle and Suppress the Plague, Thoroughly Completing Prevention and Control Work Before the Autumn-Winter Epidemic Season</h3>
<p>— Nanchang Dispatch, 19th. Special Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>The war brought unparalleled disasters to the people of Jiangxi, and it also spread various terrible epidemics. The plague, which had been dormant in Fujian for nearly forty years, also revived during the war. When the brutal enemy troops entered Fujian, coastal residents moved to Jiangxi in droves, and the man-eating "Black Death" was thus transmitted. Its transmission route initially went from Nanping and Duwu in Fujian to Guangze. Another route went from Pucheng to Guangfeng. Due to poor epidemic prevention equipment, it spread year after year to Nancheng, Nanfeng, Lichuan, Linchuan, Guangchang, Shangrao, Jinxi, and other counties. Now, black terror almost covers most of Jiangxi province. The expansion of the epidemic area, the large number of deaths, and the rapid spread are truly frightening.</p>
<p>Border Area Between Fujian and Jiangxi: Dead Rats Discovered</p>
<p>The earliest record of the plague in Jiangxi was in March of the 30th year of the Republic of China when several dead rats were found in a rice shop in Shunhuafang, Guangze, near Fujian, due to frequent transportation between Fujian and Jiangxi. No one paid attention to it at the time. Later, dead rats continued to be discovered, and plague patients appeared. It was then suspected to be the plague. Therefore, the initial date of occurrence and the number of patients were not recorded. As the infection spread more widely, the local authorities immediately notified the Provincial Health Department to dispatch epidemic prevention personnel to carry out prevention and control. As of June 17, of the 34 people treated, 28 died, 5 were cured, and 1 escaped. The high mortality rate was truly alarming!</p>
<p>The Plague's Main Camp: Nancheng Issues an Emergency</p>
<p>The plague germs, which killed millions, then spread to Nancheng in June of the 33rd year of the Republic of China. The epidemic was fierce from the start. At that time, it was after the Zhe-Gan Campaign, and Nancheng was ravaged by the enemy. People were panicked and unable to attend to the matter. A spark, therefore, started a prairie fire!</p>
<p>The plague in Nancheng spread out from the city to the countryside, extending like a fan towards Xiaoshi, Shihou, Bogan, Zhuliang, Xinfeng, Funiu and other townships. According to medical institutions' statistics, a total of 675 patients were discovered, with 362 deaths. The number of deaths that were not diagnosed, concealed, or not reported was not included. Therefore, Nancheng became the "main camp" of the plague in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Airborne Transmission: Expansion of the Epidemic Area</p>
<p>After a period of lull, the epidemic in Nancheng became even more rampant in October of the 34th year of the Republic of China. The epidemic area expanded to over sixty or seventy li away. The most severe cases of "pneumonic plague" and "meningitic plague" were discovered. According to medical experts, these two types of plague bacteria can be transmitted through the air, and their rate of spread and mortality rate are many times higher than that of ordinary plague.</p>
<p>Patients Turn Black All Over: Death Within Two Days</p>
<p>Nanfeng, a neighboring county to Nancheng, was also affected. In a household under a willow tree outside the county seat, two dead rats were initially seen. Then, two children brought by relatives suddenly fell ill, and one died within two days. Then another child fell ill, and also died within two days. The symptoms were all over the body turning black, with tears and nasal discharge but no cough. Soon after, a woman, Yuan Chen, also suddenly developed a high fever and headache, bloodshot eyes, and a bluish-black complexion, and died that evening. From then on, the epidemic spread to Lijia Pai, Yue Miao, and other places. Cases also occurred in Chuanfang, 30 li from the city. According to statistics, the mortality rate in that area exceeded 60%.</p>
<p>As the plague crossed into Nancheng, it also crept into Lichuan County. In November of the 34th year of the Republic of China, a woman named Deng, who had returned home from attending a funeral in Xiaoshi Township, Nancheng, immediately fell ill and died. After that, plague patients continuously appeared in the city, and deaths followed one after another.</p>

<p>Once It Invades Southern Xun: The Entire Province is Threatened</p>
<p>Due to the formation of the "plague's main camp" in Nancheng, the evil claws of the epidemic covered the entire eastern Jiangxi. Guangchang, Jinxi, Linchuan, Shangrao, and other counties have all issued "black alerts" one after another.</p>
<p>Linchuan is only a one-day trip from Nanchang and Jiujiang. It is the distribution center for food in eastern Jiangxi, with frequent transportation. If the epidemic in Linchuan revives, southern Xun may become an indicator of plague germs invading, and the lives of the people of the entire Jiangxi province will be under a serious threat.</p>
<p>Among the areas in Jiangxi affected by the plague, Nancheng has the most patients, followed by Guangze. According to preliminary investigations and statistics (minimum figures), Nancheng has a total of 675 plague patients, with 372 deaths; Guangze has 525 patients, with 182 deaths. In January of this year, Nanfeng had 93 plague patients, with 51 deaths; Lichuan had 93 patients, with 39 deaths; and Linchuan had 57 patients, with 16 deaths.</p>
<p>Setting Up Epidemic Prevention Offices in Nancheng and Linchuan</p>
<p>What about the work of plague medical prevention and control? In view of the plague's invasion, the Jiangxi Provincial Health Department immediately dispatched epidemic prevention teams to various epidemic areas for medical treatment and prevention and control, and established an epidemic prevention office in Nancheng. Although the plague has not been completely eradicated in these years, it has indeed been quite effective.</p>
<p>In addition to the 1st and 9th squadrons of the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Headquarters stationed in Linchuan, the 3rd squadron stationed in Nancheng, the 5th squadron stationed in Nanfeng, and several health technicians stationed in Lichuan, epidemic prevention offices and isolation hospitals have also been established in each county to treat patients who have already been infected.</p>
<p>Three Steps to Prevent the Plague: Intensified Implementation</p>
<p>Faced with this epidemic that threatens people's lives, the Jiangxi Branch of the Executive Yuan decided to implement planned prevention and control. In May of this year, it dispatched the first mobile medical and epidemic prevention team set up by the branch, together with personnel from the Health Department, to start large-scale eradication work in eastern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>First, the team gave a general preventive injection to the people in the epidemic area. At that time, 6,659 people were injected in Nancheng, 1,515 people were injected in Guangchang, and 500 people were injected in Jinxi. Injections were also given to households in the countryside of Linchuan, Nanfeng, and other counties.</p>
<p>The second step was to carry out rat extermination and flea eradication work in various places. In Nancheng, 9,521 rat holes were filled, 6,155 rat holes were fumigated, 1,697 rooms were sprayed with flea-killing agents, and 1,819 rats were collected. Similar work was also carried out in Linchuan, Guangchang, Jinxi, and other counties.</p>
<p>The third step was to simultaneously establish plague isolation hospitals in the epidemic area, dispatch medical and technical personnel, and transport large quantities of medicines and equipment to carry out medical treatment.</p>
<p>Recognizing the Necessity of Addressing the Root Cause: Experts Exert Efforts</p>
<p>After emergency measures were taken, medical experts believed that there was a need for further "addressing the root cause." Thus, they built fortresses to encircle and suppress the plague in various places. The methods were: (1) Establishing epidemic prevention committees in each county, with the commissioner and county magistrate as the chairman and the president of the provincial hospital as the vice chairman, responsible for presiding over epidemic prevention matters. (2) Launching epidemic prevention publicity. (3) Studying methods to eliminate the pathogen. (4) Strengthening isolation hospitals. (5) Strengthening plague intelligence. (6) Managing the epidemic area. Villages where the plague occurs should be specially managed, and no one should be allowed to travel to and from them, so as to prevent its spread in a containment manner.</p>
<p>Improving Knowledge Level: Beneficial for Rat Extermination</p>
<p>Currently, the most difficult problem in eradicating the plague in Jiangxi is that the public's knowledge level is too low. They are ignorant of the dangers of plague transmission, often concealing it and even fleeing elsewhere for fear of being forced to go to the hospital. As for the Baojia, they are also shielding out of sentiment and not reporting, so the true number of patients cannot be counted.</p>
<p>Most of the local gentry and Baojia chiefs hold old-fashioned ideas, conceal and do not report the epidemic situation, and do not assist in the management of the epidemic area. They do not know how to engage in prevention work and improve environmental hygiene, but only know how to seek gods and worship Buddhas, hold Taoist rituals to send off boats, and other superstitious acts, so that the transmission becomes more and more widespread and difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Completing Prevention and Control Before the Plague Season</p>
<p>Hospital equipment is lacking, and medicines and equipment are also insufficient. The Jiangxi Branch of the Executive Yuan distributes few types of medicines, and the provincial and county health agencies are all financially strapped, so there is no talk of purchasing medicines.</p>
<p>It is now heard that the Jiangxi Branch of the Executive Yuan, in order to assist in the thorough eradication of the plague in eastern Jiangxi, has approved the allocation of a large number of medicines and 25 million yuan in national currency, which will be used by the Eastern Jiangxi Plague Prevention and Control Office. The branch has also sent a special commissioner, Liu Nan, together with Dr. Sanderson from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) office in Jiangxi and plague prevention and control expert Mr. Boriss from the Health Department, to inspect the Linchuan and Nancheng areas. A plague prevention and control symposium was also held in Nancheng, which decided to establish the Eastern Jiangxi Plague Prevention and Control Headquarters in Nancheng and set up branch offices in Linchuan and Lichuan to prepare for the completion of prevention, control, and eradication work before the plague season in late autumn and early winter of this year.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Hefei</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from the 12th. Dou Baiping</p>
<p>Hefei has many historical sites. Due to the reporter's limited time, I only visited Mingjiao Temple, Xiaoyaojin, and Bao Gong River and had a quick look. This place has been occupied by the enemy for eight years, and many places in the city have changed. These three places are naturally not what they used to be.</p>
<p>Mingjiao Temple is on East Gate Street, nestled in the middle of residential houses. However, the temple's position is suddenly high. You have to step up more than a dozen stone steps to enter the main gate. To the right, there is a small pavilion, which is said to be the old site where Cao Cao of Wei reviewed his troops, called the Dianjiangtai (Troop Review Platform). In fact, whether this is true or not, the reporter dares not make a definitive report to the readers, because in addition to this high earthen platform, there are no other relics of Cao Cao to be seen, and there is no record in the official history. It is only true that Hefei belonged to the Wei Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period. As for whether Cao Cao really reviewed his troops here that year, no one can be sure.</p>
<p>Xiaoyaojin is famous for the prestige of Zhang Liao during the Three Kingdoms period. It is said that it was originally outside the city of Hefei. During the Ming Dynasty, the city of Hefei was rebuilt and expanded, and Xiaoyaojin was surrounded in the northeast corner of the city. Now, it is just a vast grassland, only for sightseeing and remembrance.</p>
<p>Going left out of the Nanxun Gate, it is only a few dozen steps to Bao Gong Temple. The temple is in the middle of the water, with a stone statue of Bao Xiaosu. When the enemy occupied it, the temple buildings were damaged a lot. Next to the temple is a memorial pavilion where Bao Gong studied in his childhood. Opposite the temple is Baojia Village, which is the descendants of Bao Gong. They all look like impoverished households. Recently, the provincial government allocated 10 million yuan to rebuild Bao Temple, so it will definitely be a new look in the near future.</p>
<h3>Two Grand Gatherings in Paris</h3>
<p>— Paris Air Mail, 10th. Wang Ren</p>
<p>In recent years, the status of overseas Chinese has been increasing day by day, soaring with the wind. France, in relation to China, is a democratic and advanced country in terms of politics, and the two share similar national characteristics, both being rich in ideals and inclined to freedom in the Southern Continent. In normal times, they share similar sentiments, and in times of trouble, they help each other. Our Chinese Ambassador to France, Qian Tai, as a legal expert, holds an important diplomatic post. At the first Paris Peace Conference in 1919, he had already represented the Ministry of Justice as a specialized commissioner. At the second peace conference, which continued from July to October of this year, he, together with former Foreign Minister Guo and Ambassador Fu, served as the official representatives of the Republic of China. This year's 35th Double Tenth National Day happened to be held before the end of the peace conference. As a result, the magnificent scene outside the embassy at No. 11 Avenue George V in the 8th arrondissement of Paris was almost unprecedented since the establishment of the embassy.</p>
<p>Guests, after arriving on the first floor and being announced by the attendant, entered the Chinese hall to the right, shaking hands and congratulating Ambassador Qian and Madam Qian. Then, they turned into the hall on the left, which was filled with plates of delicacies, allowing people to sample the culinary treasures. Among the guests were people of all kinds, including the red-robed Papal Ambassador and the black-skinned African representatives to the peace conference, as well as Ms. Yang Yunxin, a green-clad and red-lipped artist from China, and Ms. Ji Bang, the black-haired and dark-skirted female secretary of Ambassador Hu to Russia. Zhao Gongyi, the former Consul General in Paris, who is considered a veteran in the consular world, Ambassador Jin Wensi to Belgium, who has participated in both peace conferences over the past 30 years, Madam Jin Zhu Meifang, Counselors Sheng Jun and Jiang Xi, Madam Gong, Madam Jiang, etc., people who are not usually seen, can all be seen at this time. Looking up, it is like ascending an international palace; looking down, it is like stepping on Chinese soil. There were nearly a thousand people rubbing shoulders. The joy of this gathering is not easy to come by in other years.</p>
<p>After the embassy's celebration was completed, the grand meeting celebrating National Day at the "Hemicycle" of the Sorbonne, the highest academic institution in Paris, in the 5th arrondissement, began under the leadership of Ambassador Qian, following the established procedure.</p>
<p>At this time, the Chinese and foreign men and women who attended the meeting were seated in the boxes and stalls, no longer chatting and laughing as in a tea party, but becoming spectators around the stage. After the chairman group, including Mr. Zhang Nan, delivered congratulatory speeches, it was followed by a revue. There were light and agile jumping, driving, and other skills, as well as illusions, and Western songs that resonated through the clouds. The Chinese ladies who were welcomed by the general audience, walking slowly, displayed the refined cultural traditions passed down for thousands of years, like the bright moon in the sky and the light clouds emerging from the mountains, which are absolutely opposite to the quick and agile posture of Westerners. This is the reporter's occasional thought at a gathering of countless wonders. Mr. Du Fang and other members of the famous French weekly "Paris Actualites," who love our country and are proficient in Chinese, were diligently filming on the scene that day. It is heard that they will soon publish their findings to the world.</p>

<h3>Taiwan After the Restoration</h3>
<p>— Photo by Chen Xunyu</p>
<p>Taiwan, also named Formosa, in Dutch, means "beautiful island," so the scenery is beautiful and the four seasons are like spring. In the past, the island was originally Chinese territory. After the Europeans moved east, the Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch successively colonized the island and lived with the Han Chinese. During the Yuan Dynasty, a patrol and inspection office was set up, and the Penghu Islands and Taiwan were incorporated into the Chinese territory. During the early Ming Dynasty, in the 20th year of Hongwu, the patrol and inspection office was abolished and merged into a part of the Chinese mainland. During the Jiajing period, it became a base for pirates such as Zeng Yiben and Lin Feng. Until the eighth year of Chongzhen, Zheng Zhilong occupied Taiwan and resisted the Qing Dynasty. His son Zheng Chenggong was also unwilling to be a slave of the captives. He sent troops to serve the king and served Tang Wang. He was named Duke of Zhongxiao. After the failure of the northern expedition, he led 25,000 troops to retreat to Taiwan, landed in Kaohsiung, and fought a bloody battle with the Dutch soldiers. The Dutch were unable to support themselves and surrendered, and it became a vassal state of China again. In the tenth year of Tongzhi, Ryukyuans were killed in Taiwan. The Japanese negotiated with the Qing government. Later, China and Japan fought and signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, formally ceding Taiwan to Japan. It was the thirteenth year of Tongzhi, 1894 in the Western calendar. At the close of the Cairo Conference, the four major leaders jointly decided that Taiwan was originally Chinese territory and should be returned to our country. After Japan surrendered unconditionally, on October 25 of the 34th year of the Republic of China, our government sent Chen Yi to Taiwan to accept the surrender. The mountains and rivers were restored, and Taiwan rejoined the Chinese territory. In total, the Japanese ruled Taiwan for 52 years. The people of Taiwan have been deeply poisoned by Japanese enslavement education, thought, and writing, so the issue of re-education in the future is not to be ignored. The people of Taiwan were the first base to resist the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and the people are rich in national concepts, so they build temples and offer annual sacrifices to Zheng Chenggong's anti-Qing enterprise, which has not declined to this day. This time, the Chinese news industry organized a Taiwan inspection group in front, and Chairman Jiang and President Song inspected after the first anniversary of the recovery, which shows the importance that our country's government and people attach to Taiwan. The compatriots in Taiwan have now seen the light of day again, so they also place unparalleled enthusiasm and expectation on the unification of China and the restoration of Taiwan. The Taiwan pictures published in this issue were taken by our newspaper's general manager, Chen Xunyu, during his trip to Taiwan, which is enough to get a glimpse of Taiwan.</p>

<h3>The Origin of the "Civilized Aborigines"</h3>
<p>Two hundred and seventy-two years ago, in the spring, twenty-four strong men from the indigenous community of Zhu Mu Na, in Xia Da Pu, Jiayi, hunted in Batongguan and the nearby mountains. They chased a white deer that fled northeast, followed by their dogs, crossing mountains and ridges, wading through streams, enduring hardships. When they reached the lake, they saw its beautiful scenery and fertile land suitable for agriculture and fishing. They returned with joy, discussed with their comrades, and obtained the consent of the community, so they moved to this place. Initially, a settlement was formed on the east side of the lake, at the Stone Seal.</p>
<p>Later, when the electricity project was completed, the water level rose by dozens of feet, and all the fields and houses were submerged. Therefore, they moved again to the present settlement. As of July of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, there were 31 households, with a population of 65 men and 56 women, totaling 121 people. As of June of the 35th year of the Republic of China, there were 32 households, with a population of 81 men and 68 women, totaling 149 people.</p>

<h3>The Story of Four People</h3>
<p>— Written by Barbusse, Translated by Xishi</p>
<p>Every evening, at the corner of two streets, not far from the bright gas lamp, a young man stood there, his thin and pale face resembling an extinguished gas lamp.</p>
<p>Every day at a certain time, he would come to a certain place, pacing back and forth for a long time, summoning up his courage to look around, as if searching for someone, even staring at pedestrians, trees, and walls. His gray coat had turned green. It hung down on his thin shoulders. In the light shining on him, one could see the sparse beard on his swollen yellow cheeks; looking at his forehead in the light, there was not a trace of color. If it were a clear evening, this weak man would be timidly stranded on the edge of the crowded sidewalk, like a ship run aground, questioning the entire universe. But at a certain moment, someone would see him suddenly straighten up, a bright expectation appearing on his face.</p>
<p>A lively woman walked towards him. Like a rose, she stopped under his nose, showing him her snow-white teeth, shaking her neck surrounded by a fur collar, and singing sweet songs to express her welcome to him. On his side, a smile began to appear, and a continuous, crazy laugh. He balanced his body, but trembled violently, like a person drowning in water, pulled out and set upright. She was an absolutely beautiful woman, despite her tattered clothes. However, her beauty and the shabbiness of her clothes were in stark contrast. She seemed to be in costume, like a goddess on stage, her eyes and lips making people suspect they were sculpted.</p>
<p>The man's desire to come here was restored by his ecstasy. When he started talking, some words stopped at his lips. He took the woman's hand, one small and delicate, the other thin and slender, and they walked away together. Both of them were so thin that, from a distance, it could be said that they were two people divided from one person.</p>
<p>Over there, a hundred paces from here, amidst the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd, every evening a young woman stood there, also waiting for someone.</p>
<p>She often arrived early, and when she didn't see anyone, she would slowly drag her feet beside the newspaper stand.</p>
<p>She was wearing a coarse gray dress, shrouded in infinite melancholy. A blue ribbon on her hat was her only decoration. In the flashes of passing delivery trucks, her irregular, aged face would be reflected. Under her eyes, her nose was prominent and long, and she had a wide mouth. Sometimes she yawned, and her long teeth would flash outside her lips, revealing a hideous appearance. Her deep, dark eyes flickered constantly, her expression unusually tired, but soon she would become very alert again, as if waking up. In order to cheer herself up, she strangely dragged her feet quickly, swinging her right hand, which gripped an umbrella handle, and her left hand, which held the umbrella handle. Then she changed again. Her eyes shone like lightning, and her lips moved, talking in a low voice, in the same attitude as many people praying.</p>
<p>The reason was that over there, a man of leisurely demeanor was coming towards her. He was a heroic man, with broad shoulders, red cheeks, and a thick beard.</p>
<p>He approached and nodded to her. She didn't move at first, like a stunned bird. Her hands also trembled like the tips of bird wings. He didn't speak, and she couldn't speak either. Later, she decided to reach out and carefully grasp his arm, which was strong and full of magic, and the two walked away. She leaned on him with all her strength, but she was weak and powerless, truly like an old grandmother. He walked indifferently, not paying attention to her.</p>
<p>These two meetings, I saw almost every evening in the neighborhood. After these two pairs were perfectly matched, they disappeared into the crowd.</p>
<p>Because I am by nature inquisitive, I often continued to read these two love stories from the faces of the man in the gray coat and the woman with the blue ribbon—first tired, then ecstatic.</p>
<p>They both found companions, making life interesting, and completely obtained beautiful people as their incarnations. Although they were hideous and ugly, they actually found companions among many men and women who were more valuable than them, and it was completely successful.</p>
<p>But I often said that these two love poems would not have an ending. They were too fragile, because in each pair, one was unhealthy, making excessive demands on the other. Their poverty and supply were so great that they could not sustain them.</p>
<p>This was only a temporary situation. Fate made this sorrowful female worker obtain a handsome man with a beard, but made a flower-like woman paired with an unfortunate man whom she almost despised.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that this elegant gentleman was only receiving the admiration of an ardent and obedient heart for temporary convenience and benefit. He had many beautiful women in the world waiting for him. This young and pure woman, seeking love for the first time, was too impulsive, and in the future, she would abandon the person who begged her at the street corner every night and choose a better master.</p>
<p>These were the thoughts that arose in my heart after I gathered various accurate observations.</p>
<p>Ah! I guessed quite correctly, the result was very bad—as encountered in daily life, everything came towards disappointment, and like an unremarkable novel, it made people guess the whole thing from beginning to end. As a result, it soon came. One day, a few days after I left town, I was walking along the road as usual, but later than usual. The man in the gray coat was waiting alone. In another place, the woman with the blue ribbon on her head was also left there alone.</p>
<p>The next day, I still saw these two lonely people standing on the road, his eyes looking at the crowded people, searching for her, but she never came. Among the passersby hurrying for life, his shiny coat drooped down his shoulders, like a dead man, also like a criminal, his face covered with a layer of gray.</p>
<p>Her eyes no longer looked straight ahead, but looked at the ground in complete despair, staring at the flowing ditch water—a narrow muddy river like a big river, but not big enough to drown a person. I took a few steps back and saw her expressionless, incomplete profile. Her chest was as flat as a slate, and her wide mouth was thin and crooked.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, I stood between these two strangers who were suffering from open wounds.</p>
<p>I didn't know how to put aside this matter of waiting, nor did I know how to wait again. They each left the place they usually met. She retreated a few steps behind the kiosk, then turned and walked down the street. After retreating to the side of the road, he couldn't help but walk forward. I was very surprised that fate seemed to want to pull these two half-couples to the same place. On this desolate black stone road, they were destined to meet. Who could say that these two sorrowful people, with hearts of blood, would not get help after knowing each other? Who could say that these two people who had survived would not replace the two people who disappeared, those two beautiful people who were not suited to them? They did indeed walk closer. They raised their heads. They looked at each other. They immediately turned their heads back.</p>
<p>Alas! They actually recognized each other. At the same time, they also recognized their pitiful, unforgivable ugliness, the sin of their ugliness. I will never forget this mutual glance, because it was full of resentment and terrible curses!</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Zhu Xi and Zhu Shuzhen</h3>
<p>— Yang Ren</p>
<p>After Mr. Sun Yuehan's article "The Case of Ouyang Xiu and Zhu Shuzhen's Sheng Zha Zi" was published in this journal, there is no doubt that the phrase "meet after dusk" was indeed written by Zhu Shuzhen. However, Mr. Sun questioned the statement that "Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Tao's niece," arguing that "Zhu Shuzhen was from Haining, Zhejiang, while Zhu Xi was from Xin'an, and there were no brothers who moved to Haining in the genealogy," hence believing it to be "somewhat inaccurate." As people from Haining, we are more interested in this issue. I would like to offer my shallow insights on the relationship between Zhu Xi and Zhu Shuzhen, based on what I know. First, let's cite some scattered records:</p>
<p>Haining County Chronicle, Literary and Artistic Records, Ladies' Category: "Zhu Shuzhen, niece of Duke Wen of the Hui State..."</p>
<p>Preface to the Collection of Brokenhearted Poems: "Shuzhen... married Wang Tangzuo of Lin'an..." Note that Lin'an is present-day Hangzhou County.</p>
<p>Dictionary Source: Zhu Xi, a native of Wuyuan, Song Dynasty (i.e., Xin'an), ...emigrated to Jianzhou...served under the four emperors Gao, Xiao, Guang, and Ning, accumulating official positions...died and was posthumously awarded the title of Scholar of the Baomo Pavilion, with the posthumous title of Wen, and posthumously conferred the title of Duke of the Hui State during the Shaoding period..."</p>
<p>From the surface of these scattered records, how could Zhu Shuzhen from Haining be the niece of Zhu Xi, who was originally from Anhui and later moved to Fujian? However, as long as we connect these points and observe them, we can see that it is not surprising that Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Xi's niece, and it is, in fact, very certain.</p>
<p>Because present-day Hangzhou County was where the Southern Song Dynasty established its capital; and Zhu Xi was a high-ranking official of the Southern Song Dynasty (the Zhu Wengong Shrine is located next to the West Lake in Hangzhou) and an old minister who served under the four emperors Gao, Xiao, Guang, and Ning, accumulating important positions. Therefore, although he was originally from Anhui and later moved to Fujian, it was natural for him to bring his family to live in Hangzhou for a long time due to his "official service." Because he lived in Hangzhou for a long time, it was not only possible, but also very natural for his niece to marry Wang Tangzuo of Hangzhou. Later, the Wang family moved to Haining, and Zhu Shuzhen followed her husband. However, Zhu Shuzhen became famous for her poetry, and the county chronicle took "literary and artistic" records, so only Zhu Shuzhen's name was recorded, and not her husband's family. Therefore, it cannot be considered inaccurate that Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Xi's niece just because Zhu's "genealogy does not include any brothers who moved to Haining." This is very clear in terms of both sentiment and reason.</p>
<p>We can also use other aspects such as environment and actions to provide circumstantial evidence that Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Xi's niece:</p>
<p>For a woman like Zhu Shuzhen to have such deep literary attainments, it was not something that could be achieved by ordinary commoners. Although she was naturally talented, she probably would not have been able to do it without being born into a family of scholars of the Li School, receiving education and cultivation, and having a long history.</p>
<p>After Zhu Shuzhen died, her parents burned her poems and writings; this was a noteworthy and unusual action: In terms of the "hearts of parents all over the world," after the death of a biological daughter, there is no one who does not cherish her belongings; however, Zhu Shuzhen's parents did the opposite. This was obviously because they were "officials and famous families," and there were many "unrestrained" parts in her writings, which would tarnish the "family reputation"! Therefore, in a fit of anger, they disregarded the feelings of kinship and destroyed them.</p>
<p>Based on these various circumstances, it is not unreasonable and very consistent to say that Zhu Shuzhen was Zhu Xi's niece.</p>
<h3>Serenade Beyond the Border</h3>
<p>— Ye Feng</p>
<p>Lonely Night</p>
<p>Just as the sun sets, the dim and desolate night comes pacing. The grassland is very silent: no wind, no stars in the sky. The wild grass falls asleep, and the village trembles in the cold and falls asleep... Everything seems to have fallen into a quiet valley, dreaming melancholy dreams.</p>
<p>Tonight, the grassland is very silent, and now no one is sitting on the riverbank singing. The affectionate river has fallen into deeper solitude.</p>
<p>Tonight, why has the grassland become so silent? The silence is a bit frightening. Where have those Gypsy singers on the grassland gone to play tonight? Why not leave us a harp and an accordion, so we can play too!</p>
<p>The night is very lonely, and our excited hearts are eager to play and sing a song!</p>
<p>Song</p>
<p>Do you like songs? Then let us play a "Grassland Symphony" for you! Almost everyone on our grassland is a wind and percussion musician, and there is a music concert outside our tents every night. On cold nights, we light a roaring bonfire, and many of us sit together blowing and singing... Our song is majestic and loud.</p>
<p>See, the singers of the people are coming out of the tents one by one, bringing their beloved strings to participate in our happy concert.</p>
<p>Tonight, why does the grassland seem so silent! The bonfire has gone out, and only an old man with a childlike face and white hair is sitting on the grass pile telling stories to the children. Go and ask him! The old man will tell you: Our singers have gone to a distant place to participate in a grand concert tonight.</p>
<p>Night Talk</p>
<p>It's almost midnight, but our singers haven't come back yet. Have they gone to visit the kingdom of the Horqin grassland again? The night is so cold! You should come back to the tent with us! Don't sit on the grass pile and daydream anymore.</p>
<p>Come back to the tent! We have lit a fire for you, so let's talk all night. The tent is very warm, and the old man is still going to tell you stories, tell some old stories from the grassland;</p>
<p>How the sun rises from the grassland, how the stars shine in the vast night sky, how the wind and sand whip the people on the grassland, and how those people live hard in the ice and snow...</p>
<p>Distant Thoughts</p>
<p>Do you feel comfortable sleeping on our grass bed? In your warm southern land where kapok grows, who else uses grass to lay on the bed to sleep!</p>
<p>Tonight, I see you lying on the grass bed, opening your bright eyes and looking at the dark sky outside the tent. It's midnight, and I see you tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep, and the night is so quiet, the silence makes you fall into a pool of loneliness. I know you miss your hometown a little. You stand up and go outside, look at the southern sky, lower your head and ponder for a long time before walking back again, and then there are glistening tears in your bitter eyes...</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 73</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>After Tiger Brother left with his men, I lingered for a few minutes at the temporary office set up by our commissioner in the pseudo-Public House and inspected it again. Then, I bid farewell to that commissioner, took my men to the car, and rushed to the pseudo-Autonomous Army Corps Headquarters, where originally there was "one squadron of the Security Force and one company of the 12th Regiment to handle the disarmament work." As the car drove along the road, I heard dense gunfire outside the city, knowing that the four battalions of the Security Force who had revolted and the brothers of the 12th Regiment who had revolted were fighting with the Japanese garrison outside the city. I felt very anxious and wished I could fly outside the city immediately to see what was going on.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the pseudo-Autonomous Army Corps Headquarters, I met a Security Force battalion commander from our village who had been ordered to be responsible for the disarmament. He told me that the disarmament work had not met with any resistance. The pseudo-garrison, with two numbers, the 7th and 14th, a total of more than five battalions, were willing to be reorganized immediately and rushed to the outside of the city to participate in the battle, but they requested to issue a month's military rations first, because before this, they had been deducted so much that they were almost starving to death. The commissioner we sent, the person in charge of assisting the disarmament work, had already agreed to the conditions, and now he had sent people to the three garrison battalions to check and inspect their guns, ammunition, and equipment.</p>
<p>After listening to the battalion commander's report, I went into the headquarters and talked to the commissioner for a few words, confirming that the battalion commander's report was correct. Only then did I immediately draft a report, sign it, and call a courier to send it to the headquarters. On the one hand, I wrote a note and told another courier to send it to Tiger Brother, also explaining verbally that if things went smoothly on that side, he should immediately return to the headquarters once.</p>
<p>Before my courier had gone for five minutes, just as I was preparing to leave for the headquarters, a courier from Tiger Brother rushed over, with a very nervous look on his face, handing over a note.</p>
<p>Opening the note, it was indeed in Tiger Brother's handwriting, with crooked writing on it: "Report, now investigating the bandit Yin Ergen, not truly dead, but feigning death, only I know the truth, the sons and daughters of the bandit said it very unclearly, saying that he is not in the mansion nine out of ten days, but in Shuanglongzhanzhai. Cui Jie knows the place of Shuanglongzhanzhai, and I know it too. Comrades unwilling to cooperate, heart ruthless. I am now secretly, and not telling them. Thousand ten thousand. Urgent urgent. Captain can quickly come to Cui Jie's place, must be able to meet once, after ten o'clock, I will go alone. The matter of disguise has all been done. ... Xiao Hucheng standing at attention."</p>
<p>This note was simply written like a special code, with many misspelled words and incomprehensible sentences. Except for me, I am afraid no one could understand it. I read it repeatedly twice before I understood a few key points: 1. Roughly, the comrades who went to arrest the Yin rebel mistakenly identified someone else as the true body of the Yin rebel and shot him dead. Tiger Brother recognized that it was not the true body of the rebel. 2. Tiger Brother traced the fact that the Yin rebel was hiding in Shuanglongqian nine out of ten days from the family of the Yin rebel, which is the "Devil's Cave" that Sister Cui's mother and daughter were talking about. 3. The comrades were probably a little jealous of Tiger Brother, so he also hid the matter of Shuanglongqian and asked me to keep it a secret. 4. He asked me to go adventuring with him and had prepared disguises; before ten o'clock, we would meet at Sister Cui's place.</p>
<p>In order to understand the situation that Tiger Brother had gone through in the Yin rebel's house, I questioned the courier a few more times. I learned that the guards of the rebel's house were mixed with many Japanese and Korean sticks, and the resistance was very fierce. It was still Tiger Brother who led two subordinates and found more than a dozen acquaintances from the Security Force, climbed over the wall from the backyard, set a fire, and attacked from the inside, attacking from both sides, before solving the guards and dead soldiers. It is said that the commissioner in charge of besieging the rebel's house and arresting the rebel culprit had originally intended to capture the rebel leader alive, but he did not expect that the rebel leader "Yin Rugen" would also shoot, and his shooting skills were very good. Several of our comrades sacrificed under his gun. According to the courier's own eyes, the Yin rebel was shot dead by Tiger Brother with one shot. If you want to prove it, you can check the fatal wound of the rebel's corpse. The wound was a revolver bullet, and only Tiger Brother was using a revolver on the spot, the rest were box cannons, German-style ten-shot pistols, etc.</p>

<h3>The Yu Case</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The two-way embezzlement case was sentenced yesterday. Zhang Hongtu and Yu Xiangyan were each sentenced to 15 years in prison. The lightest of the merchants, such as Jin Yunting and Cao Zuxin, were also sentenced to three years and six months in prison. The articles cited were all based on Article 3, Section 6 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. We are laymen in law, but considering the circumstances and reasoning, we always feel that this judgment is worth studying.</p>
<p>First, commissions in China today have almost become an open secret. May I ask which agency's procurement does not have a bit of "oil and water"? Many, though not directly taking money, resort to disguised gifts, such as accepting valuable gifts, which is no different from accepting bribes and corruption. Moreover, merchants are in a passive position. If the person handling the matter does not indicate, the merchant would never dare to offer a bribe.</p>
<p>Second, such a large embezzlement case at the Lianglu Bureau's Materials Department lasted for several months. Can the supervisor be completely unaware of the subordinate's crime? Should the court conduct a thorough investigation? Leaving aside the legal issues, should the administrative supervisor bear the blame for negligence? These are all questions we are eager to find answers to.</p>
<p>Corruption is rampant, and bribery is open. Severe sentencing originally has profound meaning. If one only sees the firewood and not the forest, it is abandoning the major for the minor. If one only blocks the flow without stopping the source, it seems not thorough enough.</p>
<h3>Launching a General Attack Order Against Rats Worldwide</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Dr. Curt Panl Richter of the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital studies rodents. One morning in 1941, he found six dead rats in his laboratory. Each had eaten a small amount of a chemical, phenylthiourea, that was considered harmless. This chemical had been tried by thousands of people without harming them. However, phenylthiourea clearly killed those rats. Dr. Richter couldn't figure out how that was possible. Thus, his rat reduction campaign began, and the war was on.</p>
<p>Phenylthiourea is known as the bitterest substance. There is a strange thing about it: some people, about three out of ten, cannot taste it at all. This trait runs in families. Richter wondered if this peculiar difference also existed in rats. So, he placed crystals of phenylthiourea on the tongues of the rats in his lab. None of the rats seemed to find it "unpalatable." And then they all died.</p>
<p>Richter mixed phenylthiourea in the drinking water for other rats. They drank it as quickly as ordinary water. As a result, they all died. And they died not like they had eaten other poisons, but as if suffering from severe pleurisy. Their chests and lungs filled with water, as if they had drowned.</p>
<p>After years of research, it is known that rats have a mysterious instinct to avoid eating tainted or poisonous food. But phenylthiourea seems to be an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>However, the fertility of the rats living in captivity in Richter's lab gradually decreased. Would their wild cousins be so easily fooled? Richter caught several live rats from the garbage dump, but they wouldn't touch food or water containing lethal amounts of phenylthiourea.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, most people would give up the research. But Richter knew that phenylthiourea was part of a large chemical family. From E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company, he obtained more than two hundred different thiourea compounds. One of them proved to kill wild rats as phenylthiourea killed domesticated rats. The label on the bottle read: Alpha-naparhyl-thiourea. Richter shortened and combined the first letters of each word and named it "ANTU."</p>
<p>This chemical is very cheap, costing only four dollars per pound in the United States. Richter found that only one part in two hundred thousand pounds of "ANTU" could kill the strongest rat. Enthusiastic about Richter's report, Washington funded him to continue his research.</p>
<p>At the time, the most potent rat poison was zinc sulfate. Richter's research showed that "ANTU" was twice as effective as zinc sulfate.</p>
<p>Thus, the real experiment began. Could a rat poison that performed extraordinarily well in the lab be just as effective outdoors? Because the locals hated the rampant rats and desperately needed something to drastically exterminate them, Richter had no difficulty finding helpers.</p>
<p>The rat exterminators, all volunteers, were divided into several teams. Each team was in charge of an area, and at least one person was recruited to help in each building. The teams distributed the poisoned bait one afternoon and made more detailed calculations the next day. In one area, one hundred dead rats were found the next morning.</p>
<p>Richter knew that rats have a habit of keeping their bodies clean. He came up with a clever way to spread the poison, which was to fill a sprayer with "ANTU" and spray it into the rat holes. When a rat discovers that its fur or paws are stuck with foreign objects, it will lick it off with its tongue, and thus meet its demise.</p>
<p>The results of this method applied in Jinan, within twelve months, collected 156,210 dead rats, and the exterminators believed that the number of rats truly poisoned was three times larger than this number.</p>
<p>With "ANTU," the mischief of rats can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>From now on, a general attack order is issued against rats worldwide.</p>
<h3>Singer Sinatra and His Wife</h3>

<h3>I am a Poor Man - Casual Notes</h3>
<p>— Jiang</p>
<p>I am a poor man.</p>
<p>Poor people have no joy; this is an unchanging truth.</p>
<p>But my poverty is not to the point of lacking clothing or food. I have simple clothes, simple meals, a wife who doesn't complain, and children who don't wail. But my income is always used up within the year, with no savings, no support, relying only on the mercy of heaven to grant me a healthy body. Since entering the world, I have never groaned in bed for eight or ten days. Occasionally, when I feel slightly unwell, I don't bother the "doctor" or "herbalist" and can recover without medicine. I am like this, and so are my wife, children, and elders. Although I have lived for more than half a century, my future support is still vague, but I already feel "uniquely blessed"!</p>
<p>I am a poor man, a poor man with no savings, no support. Every year, every day, I just "do what I should do," earning a few rewards for my efforts to support my family. The rewards I get can be called "not ashamed of heaven above," "not ashamed of people below." My heart is never uneasy for a single day. I don't "live in constant fear," I don't "suck up to the powerful," I "live within my means," and I "avoid socializing" Because of my solitary nature, those with lofty ideals call me a "saint," while those engrossed in worldly matters cannot help but see me as "unrelenting." As for me? I go my own way.</p>
<p>Since entering the world, I don't know what "banquets" are, I don't know what "enjoyment" tastes like. When I eat a bowl of fresh fish soup, I know it is "supremely fresh." When I wear a new garment made of old cloth, I know it is "clean." Other than that, I am just "someone who has not attained," and I dare not taste anything further.</p>
<p>I was like this in my hometown, and I am like this after fleeing to Shanghai. Shanghai is indeed much more lively than my hometown, but I don't find it lively. I only find it noisy. If I were not forced by adverse circumstances, I really wouldn't want to live here for a single day.</p>
<p>Recently, for the past year, I have still been doing what I should do every day, earning a few rewards for my mental and physical labor to support my family. The rewards I get are still, like in my hometown, "not ashamed of heaven above," "not ashamed of people below." My heart is never uneasy for a single day. I don't "live in constant fear," I don't "suck up to the powerful," I [missing text]. I still maintain my consistent style.</p>
<p>But, Shanghai is, after all, a new environment in my life history. I cannot let down this place, known throughout the world. At the same time, I cannot be like "an old monk in meditation for nine years." In my spare time, I have also wandered around a bit. But the "chaos" on the streets makes me a little dizzy. The speeding trams, the dashing cars, the rickshaws, and the pedicabs jostling around, coupled with the shops on both sides of the street doing their best to attract customers - I am used to strolling. This is simply depriving me of my rights, so I vowed not to take the first wander again. However, I feel that my life is too monotonous. Fortunately, I have a like-minded friend, also a refugee, who kindly gave me a long-term park entrance ticket. This allows me to visit any park. On weekends, I use the park to adjust my monotonous life. Every holiday, I bring two of my favorite books and buy a few packs of basic cigarettes. This is my extra expense for visiting the park. Normally, the cigarettes I smoke are from cans. In a crowded place, I feel it is not elegant. So, on this day of visiting the park, my greatest pleasure is "slowly puffing" and "leisurely enjoying" my poor man's joy.</p>
<p>The park is too memorable, especially "Hongkou"s "Zhongzheng Park." Entering the gate, there is a green lawn, refreshing the eyes. The red-purple little flowers do not carry any wealth or ostentatious arrogance. Standing briefly on the short bridge, I forget all honor and disgrace. The lotus leaves stand tall, further inspiring artistic intent.</p>
<p>I am a poor man, but I have not changed my joy. If you say this is old-fashioned, I am willing to accept it.</p>
<p>Wonderful News from Abroad</p>
<h3>Reasons for Divorce</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongsheng</p>
<p>"A married person committing adultery" is explicitly punishable under our country's criminal law. As for unmarried people committing adultery, although the law does not punish them, it is morally condemned as shameless and lacking in integrity. Therefore, although people may engage in adultery in reality, they generally try to cover it up to avoid criticism from others. However, this is not the case in New York State in the United States. Some people are inherently careful in their behavior, with no impropriety whatsoever, but are willing to say that they have indeed committed adultery.</p>
<p>It turns out that the divorce laws in the various states of the United States are not as free as rumored. For example, Chinese law allows spouses to divorce by agreement, but no state in the United States allows parties to divorce by agreement. Instead, each state's law lists the reasons for which a divorce can be granted. Only those with such reasons can request a court to order a divorce. The law of New York State makes adultery the only reason for divorce. Thus, false adultery is produced.</p>
<p>Sometimes, couples agree to divorce and go their separate ways because they are incompatible. But since the law does not allow divorce by agreement, and judicial divorce is limited to adultery, the unhappy couples in New York, after agreeing to divorce, have to invert the cause and effect, performing false adultery to achieve the purpose of divorce in order to obtain legal effect.</p>
<h3>Confidence</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying, translated from "Newsweek"</p>
<p>A satirical joke has been circulating in Germany recently. It is said that a French journalist visited a famous American atomic bomb expert during the Paris Peace Conference and asked, "How many atomic bombs does the United States need to destroy France?" The atomic scientist then asked a long list of questions, such as how many large cities there are in France, how many hydroelectric power plants there are, and so on. After consulting these materials, he calculated a large number of very complicated calculations on a piece of paper. Finally, he replied, "A total of one hundred and thirty-two are needed."</p>
<p>The Frenchmen immediately looked crestfallen. Then, he asked, "Well, how many atomic bombs are needed to destroy Belgium?" The American listened and calculated in a serious manner, saying, "Forty-three." The French journalist finally asked, "Well, how many atomic bombs are needed to destroy the Soviet Union?" The American atomic bomb expert immediately put the piece of paper into his pocket and replied immediately, "One thousand two hundred and sixty-nine."</p>
<p>Precisely: having confidence, there is no need to consider. Humanity is thus prepared to destroy itself.</p>
<h3>Group Suicide of the Japanese Army - Historical Facts of the War</h3>
<p>— Lu Shixiong</p>
<p>The barbarity and cruelty of the Japanese army are universally despised, but their spirit of loyalty to the country and self-sacrifice is truly astonishing. The following is a recollection of a tragic and moving scene of "group suicide" after the Japanese army suffered a disastrous defeat in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The U.S. forces found enemy documents on Luzon Island. This document was an order from Japanese warlords forcing more than 80,000 injured soldiers of the Japanese army fighting in the Philippines to carry out the death penalty or suicide. Many of the executed Japanese soldiers were mostly injured in the most intense battle in Manila. The following is a translation of the contents of the order issued by the former Japanese Central Command in Manila:</p>
<p>"In each unit, all those who are injured, sick, or unable to engage in combat behavior shall take two days' rations, gather at the corner of the fortress, and prepare to commit collective suicide on or around the 21st (month unknown). The commander of each unit shall assign a person in charge to supervise the death. Before the suicide, they are allowed one day and one night of free thought, so that each person can fully consider their decision to happily sacrifice for the country."</p>
<p>The document also pointed out that killing the wounded often complied with the order to charge with "Banzai" (Japanese army slogan when charging).</p>
<p>Another similar document from the former Japanese commander in Manila was also found, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Before the general attack, all those who have been injured should commit suicide and destroy all documents and sundries. In the general attack, they must gloriously sacrifice themselves and not be captured. If injured, they should be urged to commit suicide by their comrades."</p>
<p>A captured Japanese naval officer said that his commander had told him, "The situation is hopeless. Go tell the wounded in the hospital to prepare for a glorious death." This officer had accepted the request of two of his subordinates and stabbed them to death with a sword. Those who did not want to commit suicide would also be killed. Their military hospital was set up underground, and each ward was blown up, and all the people in the hospital were buried alive underground.</p>
<p>The above tragedy can be described as shocking heaven and earth and moving ghosts and gods. We think calmly, and their spirit of loyalty, courage, and self-sacrifice is indeed extraordinarily tough. It is a pity that such barbarically ingrained fanaticism is of no help to the country!</p>

<p>When Mr. Johnston, President of the American Chamber of Commerce, toured the Soviet Union in 1944, he gave a public speech. When he mentioned the American Communist Party, he said, "When the Soviet Union eats pepper, they (referring to the American Communists) sneeze; when the Soviet Union has indigestion, they burp."</p>
<h3>Weekend Chat</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>There was a comment in the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* last week saying that, according to historical records, the modern Chinese × army has never won a battle, but there are many interesting things that should be recorded in permanent records. These so-called interesting things are actually the most uninteresting to us. They pointed out in detail how Chinese × army × ships of such-and-such numbers were "trying to smuggle." The Asian Society's Qiongyai correspondence even wrote about the fact that large quantities of enemy and puppet materials received were stolen and transported out by these ships. A United Press Guangzhou dispatch even described the "× army" and "pirates" in a confusing manner, making people dizzy. However, the result was a note saying, "These ships originally belonged to the Chinese × army, but whether they were plundered by pirates or voluntarily became pirates has not been determined." Fortunately, there is such a sentence, and our "concern for the country" has been greatly stabilized. Despite the undeniable and unconvincing old traces of "never having won a battle," we still hope that this "uninteresting" matter can be "found to be inaccurate" in the future, or that some facts can be used to show that our × army is really "working hard for the public" or "being plundered by pirates," so as not to be left with some records of "interesting things" "according to historical records" by others in the next decade!</p>
<p>According to customs statistics, from January to August of this year, the total value of milk powder, biscuits, sugar, coffee, etc. imported into China from various countries was 14,954,827,000 yuan; the total value of tea, crude tea, brick tea, etc. exported from our country to various countries was 2,041,421,000 yuan. This item alone has an import surplus that is more than seven times the export value; in addition, the total value of cigarettes, cigars, cigarette paper, etc. imported from various countries into China was 17,761,914,000 yuan, and the total value of tobacco and tobacco leaves exported from our country to foreign countries was only 1,397,807,000 yuan, which is slightly less than one-fourteenth of the import value. This number is exactly double the import surplus of food; we cannot bear to write down the import surplus figures of other tonics and luxury goods. This cannot but remind people of the glass leather bags in the domestic goods market and the foreign language trademarks on domestic goods. One can understand what the so-called "promotion of domestic goods" is all about. I remember more than ten years ago, during the boycott of Japanese goods movement, many shops selling Japanese goods said after being smashed to pieces, "We are not crazy; the things of others are cheap and good, and we only know how to do business with low cost and high profit!" The words are still in my ears. Comparing them with the current situation where many "American goods vendors" are still furtively shrinking in small alleys to solicit customers, I really don't know if this is the tragic fate of our China?</p>
<p>"Yu Meiren"</p>
<p>According to Nanjing newspapers: a certain institution recently received a winter clothing fee from above. In addition to using part of it to make a set of uniforms for all employees, regarding the overcoat part, the general affairs personnel were approved to purchase the military overcoats left by the Japanese army that had been auctioned and dyed before distributing them. Each piece was discounted at 200,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, all the employees had long been looking forward to new cotton for warmth, so how could they be willing to buy these old clothes? Therefore, they asked a section chief to lead the signing of a request to stop the purchase and dyeing and issue the money to allow everyone to buy new clothes. When the news reached the ears of the general affairs personnel, they immediately flew into a rage and ran to the section chief to start talking officialese: "This was approved by ×, what reason do you have to object?" It is said that the employees have not yet complied. If this is true, I would like to advise those employees. Let's look at the lyrics as proof ("Yu Meiren"): When will the private gain and oiling end? All green banknotes are few! How can dyeing overcoats block the wind? The abacus is in the belly of the general affairs personnel; Although the request is submitted, the approval is said to be not allowed to change; From the outset, the handler must take a cut, cold point calculated, why bother to make enemies!</p>
<p>Beware of Bombs</p>
<p>News came that the Xiang-Gan-E inspection group in Wuhan actually received a "housewarming" gift, which was an "urgent warning" from the "receiving colleagues" asking the group leader, Mr. Qiu, to "know what's good for him." There were many wonderful sentences in the ultimatum, the most wonderful of which was of course the reminder to the imperial envoys to "stop the inspection work at the appropriate time" because "What's the use of worrying about things that don't concern you?" So the conclusion was "If you don't get out of here, beware of bombs." Some people say that this letter is simply the tone of a robber, but I don't think it needs to be taken so seriously; may I ask if there are not many robber mentalities in the current society? How could a dignified receiving responsibility forget the principle of "never being poor when handling"? The inspection personnel are at least considered by the receiving officials to be "afraid of him because they don't have an imperial sword," so if they want to handle official business fairly, that is really asking for trouble. It is said that the group handled this incident very properly, because they have decided that "This letter can be used as a work report to the Central Government by the members of this group." The clouds and mist will naturally dissipate soon, but we common people always feel a bit of "My ambition has not been fulfilled, and people are also suffering, there are tears everywhere in the southeast!"</p>
